chapter
i
the
man
on
the
kirkcaple
shore
i
mind
as
if
it
were
yesterday
my
first
sight
of
the
man
little
i
knew
at
the
time
how
big
the
moment
was
with
destiny
or
how
often
that
face
seen
in
the
fitful
moonlight
would
haunt
my
sleep
and
disturb
my
waking
hours
but
i
mind
yet
the
cold
grue
of
terror
i
got
from
it
a
terror
which
was
surely
more
than
the
due
of
a
few
truant
lads
breaking
the
sabbath
with
their
play
the
town
of
kirkcaple
of
which
and
its
adjacent
parish
of
portincross
my
father
was
the
minister
lies
on
a
hillside
above
the
little
bay
of
caple
and
looks
squarely
out
on
the
north
sea
round
the
horns
of
land
which
enclose
the
bay
the
coast
shows
on
either
side
a
battlement
of
stark
red
cliffs
through
which
a
burn
or
two
makes
a
pass
to
the
water
edge
the
bay
itself
is
ringed
with
fine
clean
sands
where
we
lads
of
the
burgh
school
loved
to
bathe
in
the
warm
weather
but
on
long
holidays
the
sport
was
to
go
farther
afield
among
the
cliffs
for
there
there
were
many
deep
caves
and
pools
where
podleys
might
be
caught
with
the
line
and
hid
treasures
sought
for
at
the
expense
of
the
skin
of
the
knees
and
the
buttons
of
the
trousers
many
a
long
saturday
i
have
passed
in
a
crinkle
of
the
cliffs
having
lit
a
fire
of
driftwood
and
made
believe
that
i
was
a
smuggler
or
a
jacobite
new
landed
from
france
there
was
a
band
of
us
in
kirkcaple
lads
of
my
own
age
including
archie
leslie
the
son
of
my
father
and
tam
dyke
the
provost
nephew
we
were
sealed
to
silence
by
the
blood
oath
and
we
bore
each
the
name
of
some
historic
pirate
or
sailorman
i
was
paul
jones
tam
was
captain
kidd
and
archie
need
i
say
it
was
morgan
himself
our
tryst
was
a
cave
where
a
little
water
called
the
dyve
burn
had
cut
its
way
through
the
cliffs
to
the
sea
there
we
forgathered
in
the
summer
evenings
and
of
a
saturday
afternoon
in
winter
and
told
mighty
tales
of
our
prowess
and
flattered
our
silly
hearts
but
the
sober
truth
is
that
our
deeds
were
of
the
humblest
and
a
dozen
of
fish
or
a
handful
of
apples
was
all
our
booty
and
our
greatest
exploit
a
fight
with
the
roughs
at
the
dyve
my
father
spring
communion
fell
on
the
last
sabbath
of
april
and
on
the
particular
sabbath
of
which
i
speak
the
weather
was
mild
and
bright
for
the
time
of
year
i
had
been
surfeited
with
the
thursday
and
saturday
services
and
the
two
long
diets
of
worship
on
the
sabbath
were
hard
for
a
lad
of
twelve
to
bear
with
the
spring
in
his
bones
and
the
sun
slanting
through
the
gallery
window
there
still
remained
the
service
on
the
sabbath
evening
a
doleful
prospect
for
the
rev
mr
murdoch
of
kilchristie
noted
for
the
length
of
his
discourses
had
exchanged
pulpits
with
my
father
so
my
mind
was
ripe
for
the
proposal
of
archie
leslie
on
our
way
home
to
tea
that
by
a
little
skill
we
might
give
the
kirk
the
slip
at
our
communion
the
pews
were
emptied
of
their
regular
occupants
and
the
congregation
seated
itself
as
it
pleased
the
manse
seat
was
full
of
the
kirkcaple
relations
of
mr
murdoch
who
had
been
invited
there
by
my
mother
to
hear
him
and
it
was
not
hard
to
obtain
permission
to
sit
with
archie
and
tam
dyke
in
the
in
the
gallery
word
was
sent
to
tam
and
so
it
happened
that
three
abandoned
lads
duly
passed
the
plate
and
took
their
seats
in
the
but
when
the
bell
had
done
jowing
and
we
heard
by
the
sounds
of
their
feet
that
the
elders
had
gone
in
to
the
kirk
we
slipped
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
side
door
we
were
through
the
churchyard
in
a
twinkling
and
on
the
road
to
the
dyve
burn
it
was
the
fashion
of
the
genteel
in
kirkcaple
to
put
their
boys
into
what
were
known
as
eton
suits
long
trousers
jackets
and
hats
i
had
been
one
of
the
earliest
victims
and
well
i
remember
how
i
fled
home
from
the
sabbath
school
with
the
snowballs
of
the
town
roughs
rattling
off
my
archie
had
followed
his
family
being
in
all
things
imitators
of
mine
we
were
now
clothed
in
this
wearisome
garb
so
our
first
care
was
to
secrete
safely
our
hats
in
a
marked
spot
under
some
whin
bushes
on
the
links
tam
was
free
from
the
bondage
of
fashion
and
wore
his
ordinary
best
knickerbockers
from
inside
his
jacket
he
unfolded
his
special
treasure
which
was
to
light
us
on
our
expedition
an
old
tin
lantern
with
a
shutter
tam
was
of
the
free
kirk
persuasion
and
as
his
communion
fell
on
a
different
day
from
ours
he
was
spared
the
bondage
of
church
attendance
from
which
archie
and
i
had
revolted
but
notable
events
had
happened
that
day
in
his
church
a
black
man
the
rev
john
had
been
preaching
tam
was
full
of
the
portent
nagger
he
said
great
black
chap
as
big
as
your
father
archie
he
seemed
to
have
banged
the
bookboard
with
some
effect
and
had
kept
tam
for
once
in
his
life
awake
he
had
preached
about
the
heathen
in
africa
and
how
a
black
man
was
as
good
as
a
white
man
in
the
sight
of
god
and
he
had
forecast
a
day
when
the
negroes
would
have
something
to
teach
the
british
in
the
way
of
civilization
so
at
any
rate
ran
the
account
of
tam
dyke
who
did
not
share
the
views
all
nonsense
davie
the
bible
says
that
the
children
of
ham
were
to
be
our
servants
if
i
were
the
minister
i
would
let
a
nigger
into
the
pulpit
i
would
let
him
farther
than
the
sabbath
school
night
fell
as
we
came
to
the
broomy
spaces
of
the
links
and
ere
we
had
breasted
the
slope
of
the
neck
which
separates
kirkcaple
bay
from
the
cliffs
it
was
as
dark
as
an
april
evening
with
a
full
moon
can
be
tam
would
have
had
it
darker
he
got
out
his
lantern
and
after
a
prodigious
waste
of
matches
kindled
the
inside
turned
the
dark
shutter
and
trotted
happily
on
we
had
no
need
of
his
lighting
till
the
dyve
burn
was
reached
and
the
path
began
to
descend
steeply
through
the
rift
in
the
crags
it
was
here
we
found
that
some
one
had
gone
before
us
archie
was
great
in
those
days
at
tracking
his
ambition
running
in
indian
paths
he
would
walk
always
with
his
head
bent
and
his
eyes
on
the
ground
whereby
he
several
times
found
lost
coins
and
once
a
trinket
dropped
by
the
provost
wife
at
the
edge
of
the
burn
where
the
path
turns
downward
there
is
a
patch
of
shingle
washed
up
by
some
spate
archie
was
on
his
knees
in
a
second
he
cried
spoor
here
and
then
after
some
nosing
a
man
track
going
downward
a
big
man
with
flat
feet
it
fresh
too
for
it
crosses
the
damp
bit
of
gravel
and
the
water
has
scarcely
filled
the
holes
yet
we
did
not
dare
to
question
archie
woodcraft
but
it
puzzled
us
who
the
stranger
could
be
in
summer
weather
you
might
find
a
party
of
picnickers
here
attracted
by
the
fine
hard
sands
at
the
burn
mouth
but
at
this
time
of
night
and
season
of
the
year
there
was
no
call
for
any
one
to
be
trespassing
on
our
preserves
no
fishermen
came
this
way
the
being
all
to
the
east
and
the
stark
headland
of
the
red
neb
made
the
road
to
them
by
the
water
edge
difficult
the
lads
used
to
come
now
and
then
for
a
swim
but
you
would
not
find
a
lad
bathing
on
a
chill
april
night
yet
there
was
no
question
where
our
precursor
had
gone
he
was
making
for
the
shore
tam
unshuttered
his
lantern
and
the
steps
went
clearly
down
the
corkscrew
path
he
is
after
our
cave
we
better
go
cannily
the
glim
was
dowsed
the
words
were
archie
and
in
the
best
contraband
manner
we
stole
down
the
gully
the
business
had
suddenly
taken
an
eerie
turn
and
i
think
in
our
hearts
we
were
all
a
little
afraid
but
tam
had
a
lantern
and
it
would
never
do
to
turn
back
from
an
adventure
which
had
all
the
appearance
of
being
the
true
sort
half
way
down
there
is
a
scrog
of
wood
dwarf
alders
and
hawthorn
which
makes
an
arch
over
the
path
i
for
one
was
glad
when
we
got
through
this
with
no
worse
mishap
than
a
stumble
from
tam
which
caused
the
lantern
door
to
fly
open
and
the
candle
to
go
out
we
did
not
stop
to
relight
it
but
scrambled
down
the
screes
till
we
came
to
the
long
slabs
of
reddish
rock
which
abutted
on
the
beach
we
could
not
see
the
track
so
we
gave
up
the
business
of
scouts
and
dropped
quietly
over
the
big
boulder
and
into
the
crinkle
of
cliff
which
we
called
our
cave
there
was
nobody
there
so
we
relit
the
lantern
and
examined
our
properties
two
or
three
for
the
burn
much
damaged
by
weather
some
on
a
dry
shelf
of
rock
a
couple
of
wooden
boxes
a
pile
of
driftwood
for
fires
and
a
heap
of
quartz
in
which
we
thought
we
had
found
veins
of
gold
such
was
the
modest
furnishing
of
our
den
to
this
i
must
add
some
broken
clay
pipes
with
which
we
made
believe
to
imitate
our
elders
smoking
a
foul
mixture
of
coltsfoot
leaves
and
brown
paper
the
band
was
in
session
so
following
our
ritual
we
sent
out
a
picket
tam
was
deputed
to
go
round
the
edge
of
the
cliff
from
which
the
shore
was
visible
and
report
if
the
coast
was
clear
he
returned
in
three
minutes
his
eyes
round
with
amazement
in
the
lantern
light
a
fire
on
the
sands
he
repeated
a
man
beside
it
here
was
news
indeed
without
a
word
we
made
for
the
open
archie
first
and
tam
who
had
seized
and
shuttered
his
lantern
coming
last
we
crawled
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
peered
round
and
there
sure
enough
on
the
hard
bit
of
sand
which
the
tide
had
left
by
the
burn
mouth
was
a
twinkle
of
light
and
a
dark
figure
the
moon
was
rising
and
besides
there
was
that
curious
sheen
from
the
sea
which
you
will
often
notice
in
spring
the
glow
was
maybe
a
hundred
yards
distant
a
little
spark
of
fire
i
could
have
put
in
my
cap
and
from
its
crackling
and
smoke
composed
of
dry
seaweed
and
branches
from
the
burnside
thickets
a
man
figure
stood
near
it
and
as
we
looked
it
moved
round
and
round
the
fire
in
circles
which
first
of
all
widened
and
then
contracted
the
sight
was
so
unexpected
so
beyond
the
beat
of
our
experience
that
we
were
all
a
little
scared
what
could
this
strange
being
want
with
a
fire
at
eight
of
an
april
sabbath
night
on
the
dyve
burn
sands
we
discussed
the
thing
in
whispers
behind
a
boulder
but
none
of
us
had
any
solution
he
come
ashore
in
a
boat
said
archie
maybe
a
foreigner
but
i
pointed
out
that
from
the
tracks
which
archie
himself
had
found
the
man
must
have
come
overland
down
the
cliffs
tam
was
clear
he
was
a
madman
and
was
for
withdrawing
promptly
from
the
whole
business
but
some
spell
kept
our
feet
tied
there
in
that
silent
world
of
sand
and
moon
and
sea
i
remember
looking
back
and
seeing
the
solemn
frowning
faces
of
the
cliffs
and
feeling
somehow
shut
in
with
this
unknown
being
in
a
strange
union
what
kind
of
errand
had
brought
this
interloper
into
our
territory
for
a
wonder
i
was
less
afraid
than
curious
i
wanted
to
get
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
and
to
discover
what
the
man
was
up
to
with
his
fire
and
his
circles
the
same
thought
must
have
been
in
archie
head
for
he
dropped
on
his
belly
and
began
to
crawl
softly
seawards
i
followed
and
tam
with
sundry
complaints
crept
after
my
heels
between
the
cliffs
and
the
fire
lay
some
sixty
yards
of
and
boulders
above
the
level
of
all
but
the
high
spring
tides
beyond
lay
a
string
of
seaweedy
pools
and
then
the
hard
sands
of
the
burnfoot
there
was
excellent
cover
among
the
big
stones
and
apart
from
the
distance
and
the
dim
light
the
man
by
the
fire
was
too
preoccupied
in
his
task
to
keep
much
towards
the
land
i
remember
thinking
he
had
chosen
his
place
well
for
save
from
the
sea
he
could
not
be
seen
the
cliffs
are
so
undercut
that
unless
a
watcher
on
the
coast
were
on
their
extreme
edge
he
would
not
see
the
burnfoot
sands
archie
the
skilled
tracker
was
the
one
who
all
but
betrayed
us
his
knee
slipped
on
the
seaweed
and
he
rolled
off
a
boulder
bringing
down
with
him
a
clatter
of
small
stones
we
lay
as
still
as
mice
in
terror
lest
the
man
should
have
heard
the
noise
and
have
come
to
look
for
the
cause
when
i
ventured
to
raise
my
head
above
a
stone
i
saw
that
he
was
undisturbed
the
fire
still
burned
and
he
was
pacing
round
it
on
the
edge
of
the
pools
was
an
outcrop
of
red
sandstone
much
fissured
by
the
sea
here
was
an
excellent
and
all
three
of
us
curled
behind
it
with
our
eyes
just
over
the
edge
the
man
was
not
twenty
yards
off
and
i
could
see
clearly
what
manner
of
fellow
he
was
for
one
thing
he
was
huge
of
size
or
so
he
seemed
to
me
in
the
he
wore
nothing
but
a
shirt
and
trousers
and
i
could
hear
by
the
flap
of
his
feet
on
the
sand
that
he
was
barefoot
suddenly
tam
dyke
gave
a
gasp
of
astonishment
it
the
black
minister
he
said
it
was
indeed
a
black
man
as
we
saw
when
the
moon
came
out
of
a
cloud
his
head
was
on
his
breast
and
he
walked
round
the
fire
with
measured
regular
steps
at
intervals
he
would
stop
and
raise
both
hands
to
the
sky
and
bend
his
body
in
the
direction
of
the
moon
but
he
never
uttered
a
word
magic
said
archie
going
to
raise
satan
we
must
bide
here
and
see
what
happens
for
he
grip
us
if
we
try
to
go
back
the
moon
ower
high
the
procession
continued
as
if
to
some
slow
music
i
had
been
in
no
fear
of
the
adventure
back
there
by
our
cave
but
now
that
i
saw
the
thing
from
close
at
hand
my
courage
began
to
ebb
there
was
something
desperately
uncanny
about
this
great
negro
who
had
shed
his
clerical
garments
and
was
now
practising
some
strange
magic
alone
by
the
sea
i
had
no
doubt
it
was
the
black
art
for
there
was
that
in
the
air
and
the
scene
which
spelled
the
unlawful
as
we
watched
the
circles
stopped
and
the
man
threw
something
on
the
fire
a
thick
smoke
rose
of
which
we
could
feel
the
aromatic
scent
and
when
it
was
gone
the
flame
burned
with
a
silvery
blueness
like
moonlight
still
no
sound
came
from
the
minister
but
he
took
something
from
his
belt
and
began
to
make
odd
markings
in
the
sand
between
the
inner
circle
and
the
fire
as
he
turned
the
moon
gleamed
on
the
implement
and
we
saw
it
was
a
great
knife
we
were
now
scared
in
real
earnest
here
were
we
three
boys
at
night
in
a
lonely
place
a
few
yards
from
a
savage
with
a
knife
the
adventure
was
far
past
my
liking
and
even
the
intrepid
archie
was
having
qualms
if
i
could
judge
from
his
set
face
as
for
tam
his
teeth
were
chattering
like
a
suddenly
i
felt
something
soft
and
warm
on
the
rock
at
my
right
hand
i
felt
again
and
lo
it
was
the
man
clothes
there
were
his
boots
and
socks
his
minister
coat
and
his
minister
hat
this
made
the
predicament
worse
for
if
we
waited
till
he
finished
his
rites
we
should
for
certain
be
found
by
him
at
the
same
time
to
return
over
the
boulders
in
the
bright
moonlight
seemed
an
equally
sure
way
to
discovery
i
whispered
to
archie
who
was
for
waiting
a
little
longer
may
turn
up
he
said
it
was
always
his
way
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
turned
up
for
we
had
no
chance
of
testing
it
the
situation
had
proved
too
much
for
the
nerves
of
tam
dyke
as
the
man
turned
towards
us
in
his
bowings
and
bendings
tam
suddenly
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shouted
at
him
a
piece
of
schoolboy
rudeness
then
fashionable
in
kirkcaple
called
ye
my
bonny
man
then
clutching
his
lantern
he
ran
for
dear
life
while
archie
and
i
raced
at
his
heels
as
i
turned
i
had
a
glimpse
of
a
huge
figure
knife
in
hand
bounding
towards
us
though
i
only
saw
it
in
the
turn
of
a
head
the
face
stamped
itself
indelibly
upon
my
mind
it
was
black
black
as
ebony
but
it
was
different
from
the
ordinary
negro
there
were
no
thick
lips
and
flat
nostrils
rather
if
i
could
trust
my
eyes
the
nose
was
and
the
lines
of
the
mouth
sharp
and
firm
but
it
was
distorted
into
an
expression
of
such
a
devilish
fury
and
amazement
that
my
heart
became
like
water
we
had
a
start
as
i
have
said
of
some
twenty
or
thirty
yards
among
the
boulders
we
were
not
at
a
great
disadvantage
for
a
boy
can
flit
quickly
over
them
while
a
grown
man
must
pick
his
way
archie
as
ever
kept
his
wits
the
best
of
us
straight
for
the
burn
he
shouted
in
a
hoarse
whisper
we
beat
him
on
the
slope
we
passed
the
boulders
and
slithered
over
the
outcrop
of
red
rock
and
the
patches
of
till
we
reached
the
channel
of
the
dyve
water
which
flows
gently
among
pebbles
after
leaving
the
gully
here
for
the
first
time
i
looked
back
and
saw
nothing
i
stopped
involuntarily
and
that
halt
was
nearly
my
undoing
for
our
pursuer
had
reached
the
burn
before
us
but
lower
down
and
was
coming
up
its
bank
to
cut
us
off
at
most
times
i
am
a
notable
coward
and
in
these
days
i
was
still
more
of
one
owing
to
a
quick
and
imagination
but
now
i
think
i
did
a
brave
thing
though
more
by
instinct
than
resolution
archie
was
running
first
and
had
already
splashed
through
the
burn
tam
came
next
just
about
to
cross
and
the
black
man
was
almost
at
his
elbow
another
second
and
tam
would
have
been
in
his
clutches
had
i
not
yelled
out
a
warning
and
made
straight
up
the
bank
of
the
burn
tam
fell
into
the
pool
i
could
hear
his
spluttering
cry
but
he
got
across
for
i
heard
archie
call
to
him
and
the
two
vanished
into
the
thicket
which
clothes
all
the
left
bank
of
the
gully
the
pursuer
seeing
me
on
his
own
side
of
the
water
followed
straight
on
and
before
i
knew
it
had
become
a
race
between
the
two
of
us
i
was
hideously
frightened
but
not
without
hope
for
the
screes
and
shelves
of
this
right
side
of
the
gully
were
known
to
me
from
many
a
day
exploring
i
was
light
on
my
feet
and
uncommonly
sound
in
wind
being
by
far
the
best
runner
in
kirkcaple
if
i
could
only
keep
my
lead
till
i
reached
a
certain
corner
i
knew
of
i
could
outwit
my
enemy
for
it
was
possible
from
that
place
to
make
a
detour
behind
a
waterfall
and
get
into
a
secret
path
of
ours
among
the
bushes
i
flew
up
the
steep
screes
not
daring
to
look
round
but
at
the
top
where
the
rocks
begin
i
had
a
glimpse
of
my
pursuer
the
man
could
run
heavy
in
build
though
he
was
he
was
not
six
yards
behind
me
and
i
could
see
the
white
of
his
eyes
and
the
red
of
his
gums
i
saw
something
else
a
glint
of
white
metal
in
his
hand
he
still
had
his
knife
fear
sent
me
up
the
rocks
like
a
seagull
and
i
scrambled
and
leaped
making
for
the
corner
i
knew
of
something
told
me
that
the
pursuit
was
slackening
and
for
a
moment
i
halted
to
look
round
a
second
time
a
halt
was
nearly
the
end
of
me
a
great
stone
flew
through
the
air
and
took
the
cliff
an
inch
from
my
head
me
with
splinters
and
now
i
began
to
get
angry
i
pulled
myself
into
cover
skirted
a
rock
till
i
came
to
my
corner
and
looked
back
for
the
enemy
there
he
was
scrambling
by
the
way
i
had
come
and
making
a
prodigious
clatter
among
the
stones
i
picked
up
a
loose
bit
of
rock
and
hurled
it
with
all
my
force
in
his
direction
it
broke
before
it
reached
him
but
a
considerable
lump
to
my
joy
took
him
full
in
the
face
then
my
terrors
revived
i
slipped
behind
the
waterfall
and
was
soon
in
the
thicket
and
toiling
towards
the
top
i
think
this
last
bit
was
the
worst
in
the
race
for
my
strength
was
failing
and
i
seemed
to
hear
those
horrid
steps
at
my
heels
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
as
careless
of
my
best
clothes
i
tore
through
the
hawthorn
bushes
then
i
struck
the
path
and
to
my
relief
came
on
archie
and
tam
who
were
running
slowly
in
desperate
anxiety
about
my
fate
we
then
took
hands
and
soon
reached
the
top
of
the
gully
for
a
second
we
looked
back
the
pursuit
had
ceased
and
far
down
the
burn
we
could
hear
the
sounds
as
of
some
one
going
back
to
the
sands
face
is
bleeding
davie
did
he
get
near
enough
to
hit
you
archie
asked
hit
me
with
a
stone
but
i
gave
him
better
he
got
a
bleeding
nose
to
remember
this
night
by
we
did
not
dare
take
the
road
by
the
links
but
made
for
the
nearest
human
habitation
this
was
a
farm
about
half
a
mile
inland
and
when
we
reached
it
we
lay
down
by
the
gate
and
panted
lost
my
lantern
said
tam
big
black
brute
see
if
i
do
tell
my
father
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
archie
fiercely
knows
nothing
about
us
and
ca
do
us
any
harm
but
if
the
story
got
out
and
he
found
out
who
we
were
he
murder
the
lot
of
us
he
made
us
swear
secrecy
which
we
were
willing
enough
to
do
seeing
very
clearly
the
sense
in
his
argument
then
we
struck
the
highroad
and
trotted
back
at
our
best
pace
to
kirkcaple
fear
of
our
families
gradually
ousting
fear
of
pursuit
in
our
excitement
archie
and
i
forgot
about
our
sabbath
hats
reposing
quietly
below
a
whin
bush
on
the
links
we
were
not
destined
to
escape
without
detection
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
mr
murdoch
had
been
taken
ill
with
the
after
the
second
psalm
and
the
congregation
had
been
abruptly
dispersed
my
mother
had
waited
for
me
at
the
church
door
and
seeing
no
signs
of
her
son
had
searched
the
gallery
then
the
truth
came
out
and
had
i
been
only
for
a
mild
walk
on
the
links
retribution
would
have
overtaken
my
truantry
but
to
add
to
this
i
arrived
home
with
a
scratched
face
no
hat
and
several
rents
in
my
best
trousers
i
was
well
cuffed
and
sent
to
bed
with
the
promise
of
chastisement
when
my
father
should
come
home
in
the
morning
my
father
arrived
before
breakfast
next
day
and
i
was
duly
and
soundly
whipped
i
set
out
for
school
with
aching
bones
to
add
to
the
usual
depression
of
monday
morning
at
the
corner
of
the
nethergate
i
fell
in
with
archie
who
was
staring
at
a
trap
carrying
two
men
which
was
coming
down
the
street
it
was
the
free
church
minister
he
had
married
a
rich
wife
and
kept
a
horse
driving
the
preacher
of
yesterday
to
the
railway
station
archie
and
i
were
in
behind
a
doorpost
in
a
twinkling
so
that
we
could
see
in
safety
the
last
of
our
enemy
he
was
dressed
in
minister
clothes
with
a
heavy
and
a
brand
new
gladstone
bag
he
was
talking
loudly
as
he
passed
and
the
free
church
minister
seemed
to
be
listening
attentively
i
heard
his
deep
voice
saying
something
about
the
of
god
in
this
place
but
what
i
noticed
specially
and
the
sight
made
me
forget
my
aching
hinder
parts
was
that
he
had
a
swollen
eye
and
two
strips
of
on
his
cheek
chapter
ii
furth
fortune
in
this
plain
story
of
mine
there
will
be
so
many
wild
doings
ere
the
end
is
reached
that
i
beg
my
reader
assent
to
a
prosaic
digression
i
will
tell
briefly
the
things
which
happened
between
my
sight
of
the
man
on
the
kirkcaple
sands
and
my
voyage
to
africa
i
continued
for
three
years
at
the
burgh
school
where
my
progress
was
less
notable
in
my
studies
than
in
my
sports
one
by
one
i
saw
my
companions
pass
out
of
idle
boyhood
and
be
set
to
professions
tam
dyke
on
two
occasions
ran
off
to
sea
in
the
dutch
schooners
which
used
to
load
with
coal
in
our
port
and
finally
his
father
gave
him
his
will
and
he
was
apprenticed
to
the
merchant
service
archie
leslie
who
was
a
year
my
elder
was
destined
for
the
law
so
he
left
kirkcaple
for
an
edinburgh
office
where
he
was
also
to
take
out
classes
at
the
college
i
remained
on
at
school
till
i
sat
alone
by
myself
in
the
highest
class
a
position
of
little
dignity
and
deep
loneliness
i
had
grown
a
tall
lad
and
my
prowess
at
rugby
football
was
renowned
beyond
the
parishes
of
kirkcaple
and
portincross
to
my
father
i
fear
i
was
a
disappointment
he
had
hoped
for
something
in
his
son
more
bookish
and
sedentary
more
like
his
gentle
studious
self
on
one
thing
i
was
determined
i
should
follow
a
learned
profession
the
fear
of
being
sent
to
an
office
like
so
many
of
my
schoolfellows
inspired
me
to
the
little
progress
i
ever
made
in
my
studies
i
chose
the
ministry
not
i
fear
out
of
any
reverence
for
the
sacred
calling
but
because
my
father
had
followed
it
before
me
accordingly
i
was
sent
at
the
age
of
sixteen
for
a
year
finishing
at
the
high
school
of
edinburgh
and
the
following
winter
began
my
arts
course
at
the
university
if
fate
had
been
kinder
to
me
i
think
i
might
have
become
a
scholar
at
any
rate
i
was
just
acquiring
a
taste
for
philosophy
and
the
dead
languages
when
my
father
died
suddenly
of
a
paralytic
shock
and
i
had
to
set
about
earning
a
living
my
mother
was
left
badly
off
for
my
poor
father
had
never
been
able
to
save
much
from
his
modest
stipend
when
all
things
were
settled
it
turned
out
that
she
might
reckon
on
an
income
of
about
fifty
pounds
a
year
this
was
not
enough
to
live
on
however
modest
the
household
and
certainly
not
enough
to
pay
for
the
colleging
of
a
son
at
this
point
an
uncle
of
hers
stepped
forward
with
a
proposal
he
was
a
bachelor
alone
in
the
world
and
he
invited
my
mother
to
live
with
him
and
take
care
of
his
house
for
myself
he
proposed
a
post
in
some
mercantile
concern
for
he
had
much
influence
in
the
circles
of
commerce
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
accept
gratefully
we
sold
our
few
household
goods
and
moved
to
his
gloomy
house
in
dundas
street
a
few
days
later
he
announced
at
dinner
that
he
had
found
for
me
a
chance
which
might
lead
to
better
things
see
davie
he
explained
do
know
the
rudiments
of
business
life
there
no
house
in
the
country
that
would
take
you
in
except
as
a
common
clerk
and
you
would
never
earn
much
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
all
your
days
if
you
want
to
better
your
future
you
must
go
abroad
where
white
men
are
at
a
premium
by
the
mercy
of
providence
i
met
yesterday
an
old
friend
thomas
mackenzie
who
was
seeing
his
lawyer
about
an
estate
he
is
bidding
for
he
is
the
head
of
one
of
the
biggest
trading
and
shipping
concerns
in
the
world
mackenzie
mure
and
oldmeadows
you
may
have
heard
the
name
among
other
things
he
has
half
the
stores
in
south
africa
where
they
sell
everything
from
bibles
to
apparently
they
like
men
from
home
to
manage
the
stores
and
to
make
a
long
story
short
when
i
put
your
case
to
him
he
promised
you
a
place
i
had
a
wire
from
him
this
morning
confirming
the
offer
you
are
to
be
assistant
storekeeper
at
my
uncle
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
then
read
from
the
yellow
slip
blaauwildebeestefontein
there
a
mouthful
for
you
in
this
homely
way
i
first
heard
of
a
place
which
was
to
be
the
theatre
of
so
many
strange
doings
a
fine
chance
for
you
my
uncle
continued
only
be
assistant
at
first
but
when
you
have
learned
your
job
you
have
a
store
of
your
own
mackenzie
people
will
pay
you
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
when
you
get
a
store
you
get
a
percentage
on
sales
it
lies
with
you
to
open
up
new
trade
among
the
natives
i
hear
that
blaauw
something
or
other
is
in
the
far
north
of
the
transvaal
and
i
see
from
the
map
that
it
is
in
a
wild
hilly
country
you
may
find
gold
or
diamonds
up
there
and
come
back
and
buy
portincross
house
my
uncle
rubbed
his
hands
and
smiled
cheerily
truth
to
tell
i
was
both
pleased
and
sad
if
a
learned
profession
was
denied
me
i
vastly
preferred
a
veld
store
to
an
edinburgh
office
stool
had
i
not
been
still
under
the
shadow
of
my
father
death
i
might
have
welcomed
the
chance
of
new
lands
and
new
folk
as
it
was
i
felt
the
loneliness
of
an
exile
that
afternoon
i
walked
on
the
braid
hills
and
when
i
saw
in
the
clear
spring
sunlight
the
coast
of
fife
and
remembered
kirkcaple
and
my
boyish
days
i
could
have
found
it
in
me
to
sit
down
and
cry
a
fortnight
later
i
sailed
my
mother
bade
me
a
tearful
farewell
and
my
uncle
besides
buying
me
an
outfit
and
paying
my
passage
money
gave
me
a
present
of
twenty
sovereigns
not
be
your
mother
son
davie
were
his
last
words
you
do
come
home
with
it
multiplied
by
a
thousand
i
thought
at
the
time
that
i
would
give
more
than
twenty
thousand
pounds
to
be
allowed
to
bide
on
the
windy
shores
of
forth
i
sailed
from
southampton
by
an
intermediate
steamer
and
went
steerage
to
save
expense
happily
my
acute
homesickness
was
soon
forgotten
in
another
kind
of
malady
it
blew
half
a
gale
before
we
were
out
of
the
channel
and
by
the
time
we
had
rounded
ushant
it
was
as
dirty
weather
as
ever
i
hope
to
see
i
lay
mortal
sick
in
my
bunk
unable
to
bear
the
thought
of
food
and
too
feeble
to
lift
my
head
i
wished
i
had
never
left
home
but
so
acute
was
my
sickness
that
if
some
one
had
there
and
then
offered
me
a
passage
back
or
an
immediate
landing
on
shore
i
should
have
chosen
the
latter
it
was
not
till
we
got
into
the
seas
around
madeira
that
i
recovered
enough
to
sit
on
deck
and
observe
my
there
were
some
fifty
of
us
in
the
steerage
mostly
wives
and
children
going
to
join
relations
with
a
few
emigrant
artisans
and
farmers
i
early
found
a
friend
in
a
little
man
with
a
yellow
beard
and
spectacles
who
sat
down
beside
me
and
remarked
on
the
weather
in
a
strong
scotch
accent
he
turned
out
to
be
a
mr
wardlaw
from
aberdeen
who
was
going
out
to
be
a
schoolmaster
he
was
a
man
of
good
education
who
had
taken
a
university
degree
and
had
taught
for
some
years
as
an
in
a
school
in
his
native
town
but
the
east
winds
had
damaged
his
lungs
and
he
had
been
glad
to
take
the
chance
of
a
poorly
paid
country
school
in
the
veld
when
i
asked
him
where
he
was
going
i
was
amazed
to
be
told
mr
wardlaw
was
a
pleasant
little
man
with
a
sharp
tongue
but
a
cheerful
temper
he
laboured
all
day
at
primers
of
the
dutch
and
kaffir
languages
but
in
the
evening
after
supper
he
would
walk
with
me
on
the
and
discuss
the
future
like
me
he
knew
nothing
of
the
land
he
was
going
to
but
he
was
insatiably
curious
and
he
affected
me
with
his
interest
place
blaauwildebeestefontein
he
used
to
say
among
the
zoutpansberg
mountains
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
not
above
ninety
miles
from
the
railroad
it
looks
from
the
map
a
country
and
the
in
london
told
me
it
was
healthy
or
i
would
have
taken
the
job
it
seems
we
be
in
the
heart
of
native
reserves
up
there
for
here
a
list
of
chiefs
sikitola
majinje
magata
and
there
are
no
white
men
living
to
the
east
of
us
because
of
the
fever
the
name
means
the
spring
of
the
blue
wildebeeste
whatever
fearsome
animal
that
may
be
it
sounds
like
a
place
for
adventure
mr
crawfurd
you
exploit
the
pockets
of
the
black
men
and
i
see
what
i
can
do
with
their
minds
there
was
another
steerage
passenger
whom
i
could
not
help
observing
because
of
my
dislike
of
his
appearance
he
too
was
a
little
man
by
name
henriques
and
in
looks
the
most
atrocious
villain
i
have
ever
clapped
eyes
on
he
had
a
face
the
colour
of
french
mustard
a
sort
of
dirty
green
and
bloodshot
beady
eyes
with
the
whites
all
yellowed
with
fever
he
had
waxed
moustaches
and
a
curious
furtive
way
of
walking
and
looking
about
him
we
of
the
steerage
were
careless
in
our
dress
but
he
was
always
clad
in
immaculate
white
linen
with
pointed
yellow
shoes
to
match
his
complexion
he
spoke
to
no
one
but
smoked
long
cheroots
all
day
in
the
stern
of
the
ship
and
studied
a
greasy
once
i
tripped
over
him
in
the
dark
and
he
turned
on
me
with
a
snarl
and
an
oath
i
was
short
enough
with
him
in
return
and
he
looked
as
if
he
could
knife
me
wager
that
fellow
has
been
a
in
his
time
i
told
mr
wardlaw
who
said
pity
his
slaves
then
and
now
i
come
to
the
incident
which
made
the
rest
of
the
voyage
pass
all
too
soon
for
me
and
foreshadowed
the
strange
events
which
were
to
come
it
was
the
day
after
we
crossed
the
line
and
the
passengers
were
having
deck
sports
a
had
been
arranged
between
the
three
classes
and
a
of
the
heaviest
fellows
in
the
steerage
myself
included
were
invited
to
join
it
was
a
blazing
hot
afternoon
but
on
the
saloon
deck
there
were
awnings
and
a
cool
wind
blowing
from
the
bows
the
beat
the
second
easily
and
after
a
tremendous
struggle
beat
the
steerage
also
then
they
regaled
us
with
and
cigars
to
celebrate
the
victory
i
was
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
of
spectators
when
my
eye
caught
a
figure
which
seemed
to
have
little
interest
in
our
games
a
large
man
in
clerical
clothes
was
sitting
on
a
reading
a
book
there
was
nothing
novel
about
the
stranger
and
i
can
not
explain
the
impulse
which
made
me
wish
to
see
his
face
i
moved
a
few
steps
up
the
deck
and
then
i
saw
that
his
skin
was
black
i
went
a
little
farther
and
suddenly
he
raised
his
eyes
from
his
book
and
looked
round
it
was
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
terrified
me
years
ago
on
the
kirkcaple
shore
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
a
brown
study
it
was
clear
to
me
that
some
destiny
had
prearranged
this
meeting
here
was
this
man
travelling
prosperously
as
a
passenger
with
all
the
appurtenances
of
respectability
i
alone
had
seen
him
invoking
strange
gods
in
the
moonlight
i
alone
knew
of
the
devilry
in
his
heart
and
i
could
not
but
believe
that
some
day
or
other
there
might
be
virtue
in
that
knowledge
the
second
engineer
and
i
had
made
friends
so
i
got
him
to
consult
the
purser
list
for
the
name
of
my
acquaintance
he
was
down
as
the
rev
john
laputa
and
his
destination
was
durban
the
next
day
being
sunday
who
should
appear
to
address
us
steerage
passengers
but
the
black
minister
he
was
introduced
by
the
captain
himself
a
notably
pious
man
who
spoke
of
the
labours
of
his
brother
in
the
dark
places
of
heathendom
some
of
us
were
hurt
in
our
pride
in
being
made
the
target
of
a
black
man
oratory
especially
mr
henriques
whose
skin
spoke
of
the
protested
with
oaths
against
the
insult
finally
he
sat
down
on
a
coil
of
rope
and
spat
scornfully
in
the
vicinity
of
the
preacher
for
myself
i
was
intensely
curious
and
not
a
little
impressed
the
man
face
was
as
commanding
as
his
figure
and
his
voice
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
ever
came
out
of
human
mouth
it
was
full
and
rich
and
gentle
with
the
tones
of
a
great
organ
he
had
none
of
the
squat
and
preposterous
negro
lineaments
but
a
hawk
nose
like
an
arab
dark
flashing
eyes
and
a
cruel
and
resolute
mouth
he
was
black
as
my
hat
but
for
the
rest
he
might
have
sat
for
a
figure
of
a
crusader
i
do
not
know
what
the
sermon
was
about
though
others
told
me
that
it
was
excellent
all
the
time
i
watched
him
and
kept
saying
to
myself
hunted
me
up
the
dyve
burn
but
i
bashed
your
face
for
you
indeed
i
thought
i
could
see
faint
scars
on
his
cheek
the
following
night
i
had
toothache
and
could
not
sleep
it
was
too
hot
to
breathe
under
cover
so
i
got
up
lit
a
pipe
and
walked
on
the
to
ease
the
pain
the
air
was
very
still
save
for
the
whish
of
water
from
the
screws
and
the
steady
beat
of
the
engines
above
a
great
yellow
moon
looked
down
on
me
and
a
host
of
pale
stars
the
moonlight
set
me
remembering
the
old
affair
of
the
dyve
burn
and
my
mind
began
to
run
on
the
rev
john
laputa
it
pleased
me
to
think
that
i
was
on
the
track
of
some
mystery
of
which
i
alone
had
the
clue
i
promised
myself
to
search
out
the
antecedents
of
the
minister
when
i
got
to
durban
for
i
had
a
married
cousin
there
who
might
know
something
of
his
doings
then
as
i
passed
by
the
to
the
lower
deck
i
heard
voices
and
peeping
over
the
rail
i
saw
two
men
sitting
in
the
shadow
just
beyond
the
hatch
of
the
hold
i
thought
they
might
be
two
of
the
sailors
seeking
coolness
on
the
open
deck
when
something
in
the
figure
of
one
of
them
made
me
look
again
the
next
second
i
had
slipped
back
and
stolen
across
the
to
a
point
just
above
them
for
the
two
were
the
black
minister
and
that
ugly
yellow
villain
henriques
i
had
no
scruples
about
eavesdropping
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
their
talk
they
spoke
low
and
in
some
tongue
which
may
have
been
kaffir
or
portuguese
but
was
in
any
case
unknown
to
me
i
lay
cramped
and
eager
for
many
minutes
and
was
just
getting
sick
of
it
when
a
familiar
name
caught
my
ear
henriques
said
something
in
which
i
caught
the
word
i
listened
intently
and
there
could
be
no
mistake
the
minister
repeated
the
name
and
for
the
next
few
minutes
it
recurred
often
in
their
talk
i
went
back
stealthily
to
bed
having
something
to
make
me
forget
my
aching
tooth
first
of
all
laputa
and
henriques
were
allies
second
the
place
i
was
bound
for
had
something
to
do
with
their
schemes
i
said
nothing
to
mr
wardlaw
but
spent
the
next
week
in
the
assiduous
toil
of
the
amateur
detective
i
procured
some
maps
and
books
from
my
friend
the
second
engineer
and
read
all
i
could
about
blaauwildebeestefontein
not
that
there
was
much
to
learn
but
i
remember
i
had
quite
a
thrill
when
i
discovered
from
the
chart
of
the
ship
run
one
day
that
we
were
in
the
same
latitude
as
that
spot
i
found
out
nothing
however
about
henriques
or
the
rev
john
laputa
the
portuguese
still
smoked
in
the
stern
and
thumbed
his
greasy
notebook
the
minister
sat
in
his
and
read
heavy
volumes
from
the
ship
library
though
i
watched
every
night
i
never
found
them
again
together
at
cape
town
henriques
went
ashore
and
did
not
return
the
minister
did
not
budge
from
the
ship
the
three
days
we
lay
in
port
and
indeed
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
kept
his
cabin
at
any
rate
i
did
not
see
his
great
figure
on
deck
till
we
were
tossing
in
the
choppy
seas
round
cape
agulhas
again
attacked
me
and
with
short
lulls
during
our
stoppages
at
port
elizabeth
and
east
london
i
lay
wretchedly
in
my
bunk
till
we
sighted
the
bluffs
of
durban
harbour
here
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
change
my
ship
for
in
the
interests
of
economy
i
was
going
by
sea
to
delagoa
bay
and
thence
by
the
cheap
railway
journey
into
the
transvaal
i
sought
out
my
cousin
who
lived
in
a
fine
house
on
the
berea
and
found
a
comfortable
lodging
for
the
three
days
of
my
stay
there
i
made
inquiries
about
mr
laputa
but
could
hear
nothing
there
was
no
native
minister
of
that
name
said
my
cousin
who
was
a
great
authority
on
all
native
questions
i
described
the
man
but
got
no
further
light
no
one
had
seen
or
heard
of
such
a
being
said
my
cousin
is
one
of
those
american
ethiopian
rascals
my
second
task
was
to
see
the
durban
manager
of
the
firm
which
i
had
undertaken
to
serve
he
was
a
certain
mr
colles
a
big
fat
man
who
welcomed
me
in
his
with
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
he
received
me
pleasantly
and
took
me
home
to
dinner
with
him
mackenzie
has
written
about
you
he
said
be
quite
frank
with
you
mr
crawfurd
the
firm
is
not
exactly
satisfied
about
the
way
business
has
been
going
lately
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
there
a
grand
country
up
there
and
a
grand
opportunity
for
the
man
who
can
take
it
japp
who
is
in
charge
is
an
old
man
now
and
past
his
best
but
he
has
been
long
with
the
firm
and
we
do
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
when
he
goes
which
must
be
pretty
soon
you
have
a
good
chance
of
the
place
if
you
show
yourself
an
active
young
fellow
he
told
me
a
great
deal
more
about
blaauwildebeestefontein
principally
trading
details
incidentally
he
let
drop
that
mr
japp
had
had
several
assistants
in
the
last
few
years
i
asked
him
why
they
had
left
and
he
hesitated
a
lonely
place
and
they
did
like
the
life
you
see
there
are
few
white
men
near
and
young
fellows
want
society
they
complained
and
were
moved
on
but
the
firm
did
think
the
more
of
them
i
told
him
i
had
come
out
with
the
new
schoolmaster
he
said
reflectively
school
that
been
vacant
pretty
often
lately
what
sort
of
fellow
is
this
wardlaw
will
he
stay
i
wonder
all
accounts
i
said
does
not
seem
popular
is
that
why
we
got
you
out
from
home
the
does
find
it
fit
in
with
his
idea
of
comfort
he
wants
society
and
he
does
like
too
many
natives
there
nothing
up
there
but
natives
and
a
few
dutchmen
with
native
blood
in
them
you
fellows
from
home
are
less
set
on
an
easy
life
or
you
would
be
here
there
was
something
in
mr
colles
tone
which
made
me
risk
another
question
the
matter
with
the
place
there
must
be
more
wrong
with
it
than
loneliness
to
make
everybody
clear
out
i
have
taken
on
this
job
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
it
so
you
need
be
afraid
to
tell
me
the
manager
looked
at
me
sharply
the
way
to
talk
my
lad
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
stiff
back
so
i
be
frank
with
you
there
is
something
about
the
place
it
gives
the
ordinary
man
the
jumps
what
it
is
i
do
know
and
the
men
who
come
back
do
know
themselves
i
want
you
to
find
out
for
me
you
be
doing
the
firm
an
enormous
service
if
you
can
get
on
the
track
of
it
it
may
be
the
natives
or
it
may
be
the
takhaars
or
it
may
be
something
else
only
old
japp
can
stick
it
out
and
he
too
old
and
doddering
to
care
about
moving
i
want
you
to
keep
your
eyes
skinned
and
write
privately
to
me
if
you
want
any
help
you
not
out
here
for
your
health
i
can
see
and
here
a
chance
for
you
to
get
your
foot
on
the
ladder
i
your
friend
he
said
to
me
again
at
the
garden
gate
my
advice
and
lie
very
low
do
talk
do
meddle
with
drink
learn
all
you
can
of
the
native
jabber
but
do
let
on
you
understand
a
word
you
sure
to
get
on
the
track
of
something
my
boy
and
he
waved
a
fat
hand
to
me
that
night
i
embarked
on
a
which
was
going
round
the
coast
to
delagoa
bay
it
is
a
small
world
at
least
for
us
scots
for
who
should
i
find
when
i
got
on
board
but
my
old
friend
tam
dyke
who
was
second
mate
on
the
vessel
we
wrung
each
other
hands
and
i
answered
as
best
i
could
his
questions
about
kirkcaple
i
had
supper
with
him
in
the
cabin
and
went
on
deck
to
see
the
moorings
cast
suddenly
there
was
a
bustle
on
the
quay
and
a
big
man
with
a
handbag
forced
his
way
up
the
gangway
the
men
who
were
getting
ready
to
cast
off
tried
to
stop
him
but
he
elbowed
his
way
forward
declaring
he
must
see
the
captain
tam
went
up
to
him
and
asked
civilly
if
he
had
a
passage
taken
he
admitted
he
had
not
but
said
he
would
make
it
right
in
two
minutes
with
the
captain
himself
the
rev
john
laputa
for
some
reason
of
his
own
was
leaving
durban
with
more
haste
than
he
had
entered
it
i
do
not
know
what
passed
with
the
captain
but
the
minister
got
his
passage
right
enough
and
tam
was
even
turned
out
of
his
cabin
to
make
room
for
him
this
annoyed
my
friend
intensely
black
brute
must
be
made
of
money
for
he
paid
through
the
nose
for
this
or
i
a
dutchman
my
old
man
does
take
to
his
black
brethren
any
more
than
i
do
hang
it
all
what
are
we
coming
to
when
we
turning
into
a
blooming
cargo
boat
for
niggers
i
had
all
too
little
of
tam
good
company
for
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
we
reached
the
little
town
of
lourenco
marques
this
was
my
final
landing
in
africa
and
i
mind
how
eagerly
i
looked
at
the
low
green
shores
and
the
slopes
of
the
mainland
we
were
landed
from
boats
while
the
ship
lay
out
in
the
bay
and
tam
came
ashore
with
me
to
spend
the
evening
by
this
time
i
had
lost
every
remnant
of
homesickness
i
had
got
a
job
before
me
which
promised
better
things
than
colleging
at
edinburgh
and
i
was
as
keen
to
get
up
country
now
as
i
had
been
loth
to
leave
england
my
mind
being
full
of
mysteries
i
scanned
every
portuguese
loafer
on
the
quay
as
if
he
had
been
a
spy
and
when
tam
and
i
had
had
a
bottle
of
collates
in
a
cafe
i
felt
that
at
last
i
had
got
to
foreign
parts
and
a
new
world
tam
took
me
to
supper
with
a
friend
of
his
a
scot
by
the
name
of
aitken
who
was
for
some
big
mining
house
on
the
rand
he
hailed
from
fife
and
gave
me
a
hearty
welcome
for
he
had
heard
my
father
preach
in
his
young
days
aitken
was
a
strong
fellow
who
had
been
a
sergeant
in
the
gordons
and
during
the
war
he
had
done
work
in
delagoa
he
had
hunted
too
and
traded
up
and
down
mozambique
and
knew
every
dialect
of
the
kaffirs
he
asked
me
where
i
was
bound
for
and
when
i
told
him
there
was
the
same
look
in
his
eyes
as
i
had
seen
with
the
durban
manager
going
to
a
rum
place
mr
crawfurd
he
said
i
told
do
you
know
anything
about
it
you
not
the
first
who
has
looked
queer
when
i
spoken
the
name
never
been
there
he
said
i
been
pretty
near
it
from
the
portuguese
side
that
the
funny
thing
about
blaauwildebeestefontein
everybody
has
heard
of
it
and
nobody
knows
it
wish
you
would
tell
me
what
you
have
heard
the
natives
are
queer
up
thereaways
there
some
kind
of
a
holy
place
which
every
kaffir
from
algoa
bay
to
the
zambesi
and
away
beyond
knows
about
when
i
been
hunting
in
the
i
often
met
strings
of
kaffirs
from
hundreds
of
miles
distant
and
they
all
been
going
or
coming
from
blaauwildebeestefontein
it
like
mecca
to
the
mohammedans
a
place
they
go
to
on
pilgrimage
i
heard
of
an
old
man
up
there
who
is
believed
to
be
two
hundred
years
old
anyway
there
some
sort
of
great
witch
or
wizard
living
in
the
mountains
aitken
smoked
in
silence
for
a
time
then
he
said
tell
you
another
thing
i
believe
there
a
diamond
mine
i
often
meant
to
go
up
and
look
for
it
tam
and
i
pressed
him
to
explain
which
he
did
slowly
after
his
fashion
you
ever
hear
of
illicit
diamond
broking
he
asked
me
it
notorious
that
the
kaffirs
on
the
diamond
fields
get
away
with
a
fair
number
of
stones
and
they
are
bought
by
jew
and
portuguese
traders
it
against
the
law
to
deal
in
them
and
when
i
was
in
the
intelligence
here
we
used
to
have
a
lot
of
trouble
with
the
vermin
but
i
discovered
that
most
of
the
stones
came
from
natives
in
one
part
of
the
country
more
or
less
round
blaauwildebeestefontein
and
i
see
no
reason
to
think
that
they
had
all
been
stolen
from
kimberley
or
the
premier
indeed
some
of
the
stones
i
got
hold
of
were
quite
different
from
any
i
had
seen
in
south
africa
before
i
should
wonder
if
the
kaffirs
in
the
zoutpansberg
had
struck
some
rich
pipe
and
had
the
sense
to
keep
quiet
about
it
maybe
some
day
i
take
a
run
up
to
see
you
and
look
into
the
matter
after
this
the
talk
turned
on
other
topics
till
tam
still
nursing
his
grievance
asked
a
question
on
his
own
account
you
ever
come
across
a
great
big
native
parson
called
laputa
he
came
on
board
as
we
were
leaving
durban
and
i
had
to
turn
out
of
my
cabin
for
him
tam
described
him
accurately
but
vindictively
and
added
that
was
sure
he
was
up
to
no
good
aitken
shook
his
head
i
do
know
the
man
you
say
he
landed
here
well
i
keep
a
for
him
big
native
parsons
are
not
so
common
then
i
asked
about
henriques
of
whom
tam
knew
nothing
i
described
his
face
his
clothes
and
his
habits
aitken
laughed
uproariously
my
man
most
of
the
subjects
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
portugal
would
answer
to
that
description
if
he
a
rascal
as
you
think
you
may
be
certain
he
in
the
business
and
if
i
right
about
blaauwildebeestefontein
you
likely
have
news
of
him
there
some
time
or
other
drop
me
a
line
if
he
comes
and
i
get
on
to
his
record
i
saw
tam
off
in
the
boat
with
a
fairly
satisfied
mind
i
was
going
to
a
place
with
a
secret
and
i
meant
to
find
it
out
the
natives
round
blaauwildebeestefontein
were
queer
and
diamonds
were
suspected
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
henriques
had
something
to
do
with
the
place
and
so
had
the
rev
john
laputa
about
whom
i
knew
one
strange
thing
so
did
tam
by
the
way
but
he
had
not
identified
his
former
pursuer
and
i
had
told
him
nothing
i
was
leaving
two
men
behind
me
colles
at
durban
and
aitken
at
lourenco
marques
who
would
help
me
if
trouble
came
things
were
shaping
well
for
some
kind
of
adventure
the
talk
with
aitken
had
given
tam
an
inkling
of
my
thoughts
his
last
words
to
me
were
an
appeal
to
let
him
know
if
there
was
any
fun
going
can
see
you
in
for
a
queer
job
promise
to
let
me
hear
from
you
if
there
going
to
be
a
row
and
i
come
up
country
though
i
should
have
to
desert
the
service
send
us
a
letter
to
the
agents
at
durban
in
case
we
should
be
in
port
you
have
forgotten
the
dyve
burn
davie
chapter
iii
blaauwildebeestefontein
the
pilgrim
progress
had
been
the
sabbath
reading
of
my
boyhood
and
as
i
came
in
sight
of
blaauwildebeestefontein
a
passage
ran
in
my
head
it
was
that
which
tells
how
christian
and
hopeful
after
many
perils
of
the
way
came
to
the
delectable
mountains
from
which
they
had
a
prospect
of
canaan
after
many
dusty
miles
by
rail
and
a
weariful
journey
in
a
through
arid
plains
and
dry
and
stony
gorges
i
had
come
suddenly
into
a
haven
of
green
the
spring
of
the
blue
wildebeeste
was
a
clear
rushing
mountain
torrent
which
swirled
over
blue
rocks
into
deep
pools
all
around
was
a
tableland
of
lush
grass
with
marigolds
and
arum
lilies
instead
of
daisies
and
buttercups
thickets
of
tall
trees
dotted
the
hill
slopes
and
patched
the
meadows
as
if
some
had
been
at
work
on
them
beyond
the
glen
fell
steeply
to
the
plains
which
ran
out
in
a
faint
haze
to
the
horizon
to
north
and
south
i
marked
the
sweep
of
the
berg
now
rising
high
to
a
rocky
peak
and
now
stretching
in
a
level
rampart
of
blue
on
the
very
edge
of
the
plateau
where
the
road
dipped
for
the
descent
stood
the
shanties
of
blaauwildebeestefontein
the
fresh
hill
air
had
exhilarated
my
mind
and
the
aromatic
scent
of
the
evening
gave
the
last
touch
of
intoxication
whatever
serpent
might
lurk
in
it
it
was
a
veritable
eden
i
had
come
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
had
no
more
than
two
buildings
of
civilized
shape
the
store
which
stood
on
the
left
side
of
the
river
and
the
schoolhouse
opposite
for
the
rest
there
were
some
twenty
native
huts
higher
up
the
slope
of
the
type
which
the
dutch
call
the
schoolhouse
had
a
pretty
garden
but
the
store
stood
bare
in
a
patch
of
dust
with
a
few
outhouses
and
sheds
beside
it
round
the
door
lay
a
few
old
ploughs
and
empty
barrels
and
beneath
a
solitary
blue
gum
was
a
wooden
bench
with
a
rough
table
native
children
played
in
the
dust
and
an
old
kaffir
squatted
by
the
wall
my
few
belongings
were
soon
lifted
from
the
and
i
entered
the
shop
it
was
the
ordinary
pattern
of
store
a
bar
in
one
corner
with
an
array
of
bottles
and
all
round
the
walls
tins
of
canned
food
and
the
odds
and
ends
of
trade
the
place
was
empty
and
a
cloud
of
flies
buzzed
over
the
sugar
cask
two
doors
opened
at
the
back
and
i
chose
the
one
to
the
right
i
found
myself
in
a
kind
of
kitchen
with
a
bed
in
one
corner
and
a
litter
of
dirty
plates
on
the
table
on
the
bed
lay
a
man
snoring
heavily
i
went
close
to
him
and
found
an
old
fellow
with
a
bald
head
clothed
only
in
a
shirt
and
trousers
his
face
was
red
and
swollen
and
his
breath
came
in
heavy
grunts
a
smell
of
bad
whisky
hung
over
everything
i
had
no
doubt
that
this
was
mr
peter
japp
my
senior
in
the
store
one
reason
for
the
indifferent
trade
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
was
very
clear
to
me
the
storekeeper
was
a
sot
i
went
back
to
the
shop
and
tried
the
other
door
it
was
a
bedroom
too
but
clean
and
pleasant
a
little
native
girl
zeeta
i
found
they
called
her
was
busy
tidying
it
up
and
when
i
entered
she
dropped
me
a
curtsy
is
your
room
baas
she
said
in
very
good
english
in
reply
to
my
question
the
child
had
been
well
trained
somewhere
for
there
was
a
cracked
dish
full
of
oleander
blossom
on
the
and
the
on
the
bed
were
as
clean
as
i
could
wish
she
brought
me
water
to
wash
and
a
cup
of
strong
tea
while
i
carried
my
baggage
indoors
and
paid
the
driver
of
the
cart
then
having
cleaned
myself
and
lit
a
pipe
i
walked
across
the
road
to
see
mr
wardlaw
i
found
the
schoolmaster
sitting
under
his
own
reading
one
of
his
kaffir
primers
having
come
direct
by
rail
from
cape
town
he
had
been
a
week
in
the
place
and
ranked
as
the
second
oldest
white
resident
a
bonny
chief
you
got
davie
were
his
first
words
three
days
he
been
as
fou
as
the
baltic
i
can
not
pretend
that
the
misdeeds
of
mr
japp
greatly
annoyed
me
i
had
the
reversion
of
his
job
and
if
he
chose
to
play
the
fool
it
was
all
in
my
interest
but
the
schoolmaster
was
depressed
at
the
prospect
of
such
company
you
and
me
he
the
only
white
man
in
the
place
it
a
poor
on
the
social
side
the
school
it
appeared
was
the
merest
farce
there
were
only
five
white
children
belonging
to
dutch
farmers
in
the
mountains
the
native
side
was
more
flourishing
but
the
mission
schools
at
the
locations
got
most
of
the
native
children
in
the
neighbourhood
mr
wardlaw
educational
zeal
ran
high
he
talked
of
establishing
a
workshop
and
teaching
carpentry
and
blacksmith
work
of
which
he
knew
nothing
he
rhapsodized
over
the
intelligence
of
his
pupils
and
bemoaned
his
inadequate
gift
of
tongues
and
i
davie
he
said
sit
down
and
grind
at
the
business
it
is
to
the
interest
of
both
of
us
the
dutch
is
easy
enough
it
a
sort
of
kitchen
dialect
you
can
learn
in
a
fortnight
but
these
native
languages
are
a
stiff
job
sesuto
is
the
chief
hereabouts
and
i
told
once
you
got
that
it
easy
to
get
the
zulu
then
there
the
thing
the
shangaans
speak
baronga
i
think
they
call
it
i
got
a
christian
kaffir
living
up
in
one
of
the
huts
who
comes
every
morning
to
talk
to
me
for
an
hour
you
better
join
me
i
promised
and
in
the
dust
crossed
the
road
to
the
store
japp
was
still
sleeping
so
i
got
a
bowl
of
mealie
porridge
from
zeeta
and
went
to
bed
japp
was
sober
next
morning
and
made
me
some
kind
of
apology
he
had
chronic
lumbago
he
said
and
go
on
the
bust
now
and
then
was
the
best
cure
for
it
then
he
proceeded
to
initiate
me
into
my
duties
in
a
tone
of
exaggerated
friendliness
took
a
fancy
to
you
the
first
time
i
clapped
eyes
on
you
he
said
and
me
will
be
good
friends
crawfurd
i
can
see
that
you
a
spirited
young
fellow
and
stand
no
nonsense
the
dutch
about
here
are
a
slim
lot
and
the
kaffirs
are
slimmer
trust
no
man
that
my
motto
the
firm
know
that
and
i
had
their
confidence
for
forty
years
the
first
day
or
two
things
went
well
enough
there
was
no
doubt
that
properly
handled
a
fine
trade
could
be
done
in
blaauwildebeestefontein
the
countryside
was
crawling
with
natives
and
great
strings
used
to
come
through
from
shangaan
territory
on
the
way
to
the
rand
mines
besides
there
was
business
to
be
done
with
the
dutch
farmers
especially
with
the
tobacco
which
i
foresaw
could
be
worked
up
into
a
profitable
export
there
was
no
lack
of
money
either
and
we
had
to
give
very
little
credit
though
it
was
often
asked
for
i
flung
myself
into
the
work
and
in
a
few
weeks
had
been
all
round
the
farms
and
locations
at
first
japp
praised
my
energy
for
it
left
him
plenty
of
leisure
to
sit
indoors
and
drink
but
soon
he
grew
suspicious
for
he
must
have
seen
that
i
was
in
a
fair
way
to
oust
him
altogether
he
was
very
anxious
to
know
if
i
had
seen
colles
in
durban
and
what
the
manager
had
said
have
letters
he
told
me
a
hundred
times
mr
mackenzie
himself
praising
me
up
to
the
skies
the
firm
could
get
along
without
old
peter
japp
i
can
tell
you
i
had
no
wish
to
quarrel
with
the
old
man
so
i
listened
politely
to
all
he
said
but
this
did
not
propitiate
him
and
i
soon
found
him
so
jealous
as
to
be
a
nuisance
he
was
and
was
always
airing
the
fact
he
rejoiced
in
my
rawness
and
when
i
made
a
blunder
would
crow
over
it
for
hours
no
good
mr
crawfurd
you
new
chums
from
england
may
think
yourselves
mighty
clever
but
we
men
from
the
old
colony
can
get
ahead
of
you
every
time
in
fifty
years
maybe
learn
a
little
about
the
country
but
we
know
all
about
it
before
we
start
he
roared
with
laughter
at
my
way
of
tying
a
and
he
made
merry
no
doubt
with
reason
on
my
management
of
a
horse
i
kept
my
temper
pretty
well
but
i
own
there
were
moments
when
i
came
near
to
kicking
mr
japp
the
truth
is
he
was
a
disgusting
old
ruffian
his
character
was
shown
by
his
treatment
of
zeeta
the
poor
child
slaved
all
day
and
did
two
men
work
in
keeping
the
household
going
she
was
an
orphan
from
a
mission
station
and
in
japp
opinion
a
creature
without
rights
hence
he
never
spoke
to
her
except
with
a
curse
and
used
to
cuff
her
thin
shoulders
till
my
blood
boiled
one
day
things
became
too
much
for
my
temper
zeeta
had
spilled
half
a
glass
of
japp
whisky
while
tidying
up
the
room
he
picked
up
a
sjambok
and
proceeded
to
beat
her
unmercifully
till
her
cries
brought
me
on
the
scene
i
tore
the
whip
from
his
hands
seized
him
by
the
scruff
and
flung
him
on
a
heap
of
potato
sacks
where
he
lay
pouring
out
abuse
and
shaking
with
rage
then
i
spoke
my
mind
i
told
him
that
if
anything
of
the
sort
happened
again
i
would
report
it
at
once
to
mr
colles
at
durban
i
added
that
before
making
my
report
i
would
beat
him
within
an
inch
of
his
degraded
life
after
a
time
he
apologized
but
i
could
see
that
thenceforth
he
regarded
me
with
deadly
hatred
there
was
another
thing
i
noticed
about
mr
japp
he
might
brag
about
his
knowledge
of
how
to
deal
with
natives
but
to
my
mind
his
methods
were
a
disgrace
to
a
white
man
zeeta
came
in
for
oaths
and
blows
but
there
were
other
kaffirs
whom
he
treated
with
a
sort
of
cringing
friendliness
a
big
black
fellow
would
swagger
into
the
shop
and
be
received
by
japp
as
if
he
were
his
brother
the
two
would
collogue
for
hours
and
though
at
first
i
did
not
understand
the
tongue
i
could
see
that
it
was
the
white
man
who
fawned
and
the
black
man
who
bullied
once
when
japp
was
away
one
of
these
fellows
came
into
the
store
as
if
it
belonged
to
him
but
he
went
out
quicker
than
he
entered
japp
complained
afterwards
of
my
behaviour
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
he
said
brings
us
a
lot
of
business
i
thank
you
to
be
civil
to
him
the
next
time
i
replied
very
shortly
that
or
anybody
else
who
did
not
mend
his
manners
would
feel
the
weight
of
my
boot
the
thing
went
on
and
i
am
not
sure
that
he
did
not
give
the
kaffirs
drink
on
the
sly
at
any
rate
i
have
seen
some
very
drunk
natives
on
the
road
between
the
locations
and
blaauwildebeestefontein
and
some
of
them
i
recognized
as
japp
friends
i
discussed
the
matter
with
mr
wardlaw
who
said
believe
the
old
villain
has
got
some
sort
of
black
secret
and
the
natives
know
it
and
have
got
a
pull
on
him
and
i
was
inclined
to
think
he
was
right
i
began
to
feel
the
lack
of
company
for
wardlaw
was
so
full
of
his
books
that
he
was
of
little
use
as
a
companion
so
i
resolved
to
acquire
a
dog
and
bought
one
from
a
prospector
who
was
and
would
have
sold
his
soul
for
a
drink
it
was
an
enormous
boer
a
mongrel
in
whose
blood
ran
mastiff
and
bulldog
and
foxhound
and
heaven
knows
what
beside
in
colour
it
was
a
kind
of
brindled
red
and
the
hair
on
its
back
grew
against
the
lie
of
the
rest
of
its
coat
some
one
had
told
me
or
i
may
have
read
it
that
a
back
like
this
meant
that
a
dog
would
face
anything
mortal
even
to
a
charging
lion
and
it
was
this
feature
which
first
caught
my
fancy
the
price
i
paid
was
ten
shillings
and
a
pair
of
boots
which
i
got
at
cost
price
from
stock
and
the
owner
departed
with
injunctions
to
me
to
beware
of
the
brute
temper
colin
for
so
i
named
him
began
his
career
with
me
by
taking
the
seat
out
of
my
breeches
and
frightening
mr
wardlaw
into
a
tree
it
took
me
a
stubborn
battle
of
a
fortnight
to
break
his
vice
and
my
left
arm
bears
witness
to
the
struggle
after
that
he
became
a
second
shadow
and
woe
betide
the
man
who
had
dared
to
raise
his
hand
to
colin
master
japp
declared
that
the
dog
was
a
devil
and
colin
repaid
the
compliment
with
a
hearty
dislike
with
colin
i
now
took
to
spending
some
of
my
ample
leisure
in
exploring
the
fastnesses
of
the
berg
i
had
brought
out
a
of
my
own
and
i
borrowed
a
cheap
mauser
sporting
rifle
from
the
store
i
had
been
born
with
a
good
eye
and
a
steady
hand
and
very
soon
i
became
a
fair
shot
with
a
gun
and
i
believe
a
really
fine
shot
with
the
rifle
the
sides
of
the
berg
were
full
of
quail
and
partridge
and
bush
pheasant
and
on
the
grassy
plateau
there
was
abundance
of
a
bird
not
unlike
our
own
blackcock
which
the
dutch
called
but
the
great
sport
was
to
stalk
in
the
thickets
which
is
a
game
in
which
the
hunter
is
at
small
advantage
i
have
been
knocked
down
by
a
wounded
ram
and
but
for
colin
might
have
been
badly
damaged
once
in
a
kloof
not
far
from
the
letaba
i
killed
a
fine
leopard
bringing
him
down
with
a
single
shot
from
a
rocky
shelf
almost
on
the
top
of
colin
his
skin
lies
by
my
fireside
as
i
write
this
tale
but
it
was
during
the
days
i
could
spare
for
an
expedition
into
the
plains
that
i
proved
the
great
qualities
of
my
dog
there
we
had
nobler
game
to
follow
wildebeest
and
hartebeest
impala
and
now
and
then
a
koodoo
at
first
i
was
a
complete
duffer
and
shamed
myself
in
eyes
but
i
learned
something
of
i
learned
how
to
follow
spoor
how
to
allow
for
the
wind
and
stalk
under
cover
then
when
a
shot
had
crippled
the
beast
colin
was
on
its
track
like
a
flash
to
pull
it
down
the
dog
had
the
nose
of
a
retriever
the
speed
of
a
greyhound
and
the
strength
of
a
i
blessed
the
day
when
the
wandering
prospector
had
passed
the
store
colin
slept
at
night
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
and
it
was
he
who
led
me
to
make
an
important
discovery
for
i
now
became
aware
that
i
was
being
subjected
to
constant
espionage
it
may
have
been
going
on
from
the
start
but
it
was
not
till
my
third
month
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
that
i
found
it
out
one
night
i
was
going
to
bed
when
suddenly
the
bristles
rose
on
the
dog
back
and
he
barked
uneasily
at
the
window
i
had
been
standing
in
the
shadow
and
as
i
stepped
to
the
window
to
look
out
i
saw
a
black
face
disappear
below
the
palisade
of
the
backyard
the
incident
was
trifling
but
it
put
me
on
my
guard
the
next
night
i
looked
but
saw
nothing
the
third
night
i
looked
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
face
almost
pressed
to
the
pane
thereafter
i
put
up
the
shutters
after
dark
and
shifted
my
bed
to
a
part
of
the
room
out
of
line
with
the
window
it
was
the
same
out
of
doors
i
would
suddenly
be
conscious
as
i
walked
on
the
road
that
i
was
being
watched
if
i
made
as
if
to
walk
into
the
roadside
bush
there
would
be
a
faint
rustling
which
told
that
the
watcher
had
retired
the
stalking
was
brilliantly
done
for
i
never
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
of
the
stalkers
wherever
i
went
on
the
road
on
the
meadows
of
the
plateau
or
on
the
rugged
sides
of
the
berg
it
was
the
same
i
had
silent
followers
who
betrayed
themselves
now
and
then
by
the
crackling
of
a
branch
and
eyes
were
always
looking
at
me
which
i
could
not
see
only
when
i
went
down
to
the
plains
did
the
espionage
cease
this
thing
annoyed
colin
desperately
and
his
walks
abroad
were
one
continuous
growl
once
in
spite
of
my
efforts
he
dashed
into
the
thicket
and
a
squeal
of
pain
followed
he
had
got
somebody
by
the
leg
and
there
was
blood
on
the
grass
since
i
came
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
i
had
forgotten
the
mystery
i
had
set
out
to
track
in
the
excitement
of
a
new
life
and
my
sordid
contest
with
japp
but
now
this
espionage
brought
back
my
old
preoccupation
i
was
being
watched
because
some
person
or
persons
thought
that
i
was
dangerous
my
suspicions
fastened
on
japp
but
i
soon
gave
up
that
clue
it
was
my
presence
in
the
store
that
was
a
danger
to
him
not
my
wanderings
about
the
countryside
it
might
be
that
he
had
engineered
the
espionage
so
as
to
drive
me
out
of
the
place
in
sheer
annoyance
but
i
flattered
myself
that
mr
japp
knew
me
too
well
to
imagine
that
such
a
game
was
likely
to
succeed
the
mischief
was
that
i
could
not
make
out
who
the
trackers
were
i
had
visited
all
the
surrounding
locations
and
was
on
good
enough
terms
with
all
the
chiefs
there
was
a
dingy
old
fellow
who
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
life
in
a
boer
gaol
before
the
war
there
was
a
mission
station
at
his
place
and
his
people
seemed
to
me
to
be
well
behaved
and
prosperous
majinje
was
a
chieftainess
a
little
girl
whom
nobody
was
allowed
to
see
her
location
was
a
miserable
affair
and
her
tribe
was
yearly
shrinking
in
numbers
then
there
was
magata
farther
north
among
the
mountains
he
had
no
quarrel
with
me
for
he
used
to
give
me
a
meal
when
i
went
out
hunting
in
that
direction
and
once
he
turned
out
a
hundred
of
his
young
men
and
i
had
a
great
battue
of
wild
dogs
sikitola
the
biggest
of
all
lived
some
distance
out
in
the
flats
i
knew
less
about
him
but
if
his
men
were
the
trackers
they
must
have
spent
most
of
their
days
a
weary
way
from
their
kraal
the
kaffirs
in
the
huts
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
were
mostly
christians
and
quiet
decent
fellows
who
farmed
their
little
gardens
and
certainly
preferred
me
to
japp
i
thought
at
one
time
of
riding
into
pietersdorp
to
consult
the
native
commissioner
but
i
discovered
that
the
old
man
who
knew
the
country
was
gone
and
that
his
successor
was
a
young
fellow
from
rhodesia
who
knew
nothing
about
anything
besides
the
natives
round
blaauwildebeestefontein
were
well
conducted
and
received
few
official
visitations
now
and
then
a
couple
of
zulu
policemen
passed
in
pursuit
of
some
minor
malefactor
and
the
collector
came
for
the
but
we
gave
the
government
little
work
and
they
did
not
trouble
their
heads
about
us
as
i
have
said
the
clues
i
had
brought
out
with
me
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
began
to
occupy
my
mind
again
and
the
more
i
thought
of
the
business
the
keener
i
grew
i
used
to
amuse
myself
with
setting
out
my
various
bits
of
knowledge
there
was
first
of
all
the
rev
john
laputa
his
doings
on
the
kirkcaple
shore
his
talk
with
henriques
about
blaauwildebeestefontein
and
his
strange
behaviour
at
durban
then
there
was
what
colles
had
told
me
about
the
place
being
queer
how
nobody
would
stay
long
either
in
the
store
or
the
schoolhouse
then
there
was
my
talk
with
aitken
at
lourenco
marques
and
his
story
of
a
great
wizard
in
the
neighbourhood
to
whom
all
kaffirs
made
pilgrimages
and
the
suspicion
of
a
diamond
pipe
last
and
most
important
there
was
this
perpetual
spying
on
myself
it
was
as
clear
as
daylight
that
the
place
held
some
secret
and
i
wondered
if
old
japp
knew
i
was
fool
enough
one
day
to
ask
him
about
diamonds
he
met
me
with
contemptuous
laughter
your
ignorant
britisher
he
cried
you
had
ever
been
to
kimberley
you
would
know
the
look
of
a
diamond
country
you
as
likely
to
find
diamonds
here
as
ocean
pearls
but
go
out
and
scrape
in
the
spruit
if
you
like
you
maybe
find
some
garnets
i
made
cautious
inquiries
too
chiefly
through
mr
wardlaw
who
was
becoming
a
great
expert
at
kaffir
about
the
existence
of
wizard
but
he
could
get
no
news
the
most
he
found
out
was
that
there
was
a
good
cure
for
fever
among
sikitola
men
and
that
majinje
if
she
pleased
could
bring
rain
the
upshot
of
it
all
was
that
after
much
brooding
i
wrote
a
letter
to
mr
colles
and
to
make
sure
of
its
going
gave
it
to
a
missionary
to
post
in
pietersdorp
i
told
him
frankly
what
aitken
had
said
and
i
also
told
him
about
the
espionage
i
said
nothing
about
old
japp
for
beast
as
he
was
i
did
not
want
him
at
his
age
to
be
without
a
livelihood
chapter
iv
my
journey
to
the
a
reply
came
from
colles
addressed
not
to
me
but
to
japp
it
seemed
that
the
old
fellow
had
once
suggested
the
establishment
of
a
branch
store
at
a
place
out
in
the
plains
called
umvelos
and
the
firm
was
now
prepared
to
take
up
the
scheme
japp
was
in
high
good
humour
and
showed
me
the
letter
not
a
word
was
said
of
what
i
had
written
about
only
the
bare
details
about
starting
the
branch
i
was
to
get
a
couple
of
masons
load
up
two
wagons
with
bricks
and
timber
and
go
down
to
umvelos
and
see
the
store
built
the
stocking
of
it
and
the
appointment
of
a
storekeeper
would
be
matter
for
further
correspondence
japp
was
delighted
for
besides
getting
rid
of
me
for
several
weeks
it
showed
that
his
advice
was
respected
by
his
superiors
he
went
about
bragging
that
the
firm
could
not
get
on
without
him
and
was
inclined
to
be
more
insolent
to
me
than
usual
in
his
new
he
also
got
royally
drunk
over
the
head
of
it
i
confess
i
was
hurt
by
the
manager
silence
on
what
seemed
to
me
more
vital
matters
but
i
soon
reflected
that
if
he
wrote
at
all
he
would
write
direct
to
me
and
i
eagerly
watched
for
the
no
letter
came
however
and
i
was
soon
too
busy
with
preparations
to
look
for
one
i
got
the
bricks
and
timber
from
pietersdorp
and
hired
two
dutch
masons
to
run
the
job
the
place
was
not
very
far
from
sikitola
kraal
so
there
would
be
no
difficulty
about
native
helpers
having
my
eyes
open
for
trade
i
resolved
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
it
was
the
fashion
among
the
farmers
on
the
to
drive
the
cattle
down
into
the
which
they
call
the
for
winter
pasture
there
is
no
fear
of
about
that
season
and
the
grass
of
the
plains
is
rich
and
thick
compared
with
the
uplands
i
discovered
that
some
big
droves
were
passing
on
a
certain
day
and
that
the
owners
and
their
families
were
travelling
with
them
in
wagons
accordingly
i
had
a
light
fitted
up
as
a
sort
of
travelling
store
and
with
my
two
wagons
full
of
building
material
joined
the
caravan
i
hoped
to
do
good
trade
in
selling
little
luxuries
to
the
farmers
on
the
road
and
at
umvelos
it
was
a
clear
cold
morning
when
we
started
down
the
berg
at
first
my
hands
were
full
with
the
job
of
getting
my
heavy
wagons
down
the
awesome
precipice
which
did
duty
as
a
highway
we
locked
the
wheels
with
chains
and
tied
great
logs
of
wood
behind
to
act
as
brakes
happily
my
drivers
knew
their
business
but
one
of
the
boer
wagons
got
a
wheel
over
the
edge
and
it
was
all
that
ten
men
could
do
to
get
it
back
again
after
that
the
road
was
easier
winding
down
the
side
of
a
slowly
opening
glen
i
rode
beside
the
wagons
and
so
heavenly
was
the
weather
that
i
was
content
with
my
own
thoughts
the
sky
was
clear
blue
the
air
warm
yet
with
a
wintry
tonic
in
it
and
a
thousand
aromatic
scents
came
out
of
the
thickets
the
pied
birds
called
queens
fluttered
across
the
path
below
the
klein
labongo
churned
and
foamed
in
a
hundred
cascades
its
waters
were
no
more
the
clear
grey
of
the
wildebeeste
spring
but
growing
muddy
with
its
approach
to
the
richer
soil
of
the
plains
oxen
travel
slow
and
we
outspanned
that
night
half
a
day
march
short
of
umvelos
i
spent
the
hour
before
sunset
lounging
and
smoking
with
the
dutch
farmers
at
first
they
had
been
silent
and
suspicious
of
a
newcomer
but
by
this
time
i
talked
their
taal
fluently
and
we
were
soon
on
good
terms
i
recall
a
discussion
arising
about
a
black
thing
in
a
tree
about
five
hundred
yards
away
i
thought
it
was
an
aasvogel
but
another
thought
it
was
a
baboon
whereupon
the
oldest
of
the
party
a
farmer
called
coetzee
whipped
up
his
rifle
and
apparently
without
sighting
fired
a
dark
object
fell
out
of
the
branch
and
when
we
reached
it
we
found
it
a
sure
enough
shot
through
the
head
side
are
you
on
in
the
next
war
the
old
man
asked
me
and
laughing
i
told
him
after
supper
the
ingredients
of
which
came
largely
from
my
we
sat
smoking
and
talking
round
the
fire
the
women
and
children
being
snug
in
the
covered
wagons
the
boers
were
honest
companionable
fellows
and
when
i
had
made
a
bowl
of
toddy
in
the
scotch
fashion
to
keep
out
the
evening
chill
we
all
became
excellent
friends
they
asked
me
how
i
got
on
with
japp
old
coetzee
saved
me
the
trouble
of
answering
for
he
broke
in
with
i
asked
him
his
objection
to
the
storekeeper
but
he
would
say
nothing
beyond
that
he
was
too
thick
with
the
natives
i
fancy
at
some
time
mr
japp
had
sold
him
a
bad
plough
we
spoke
of
hunting
and
i
heard
long
tales
of
exploits
away
on
the
limpopo
in
mashonaland
on
the
sabi
and
in
the
lebombo
then
we
verged
on
politics
and
i
listened
to
violent
denunciations
of
the
new
land
tax
these
were
old
residenters
i
reflected
and
i
might
learn
perhaps
something
of
value
so
very
carefully
i
repeated
a
tale
i
said
i
had
heard
at
durban
of
a
great
wizard
somewhere
in
the
berg
and
asked
if
any
one
knew
of
it
they
shook
their
heads
the
natives
had
given
up
witchcraft
and
big
medicine
they
said
and
were
more
afraid
of
a
parson
or
a
policeman
than
any
then
they
were
starting
on
reminiscences
when
old
coetzee
who
was
deaf
broke
in
and
asked
to
have
my
question
repeated
he
said
know
it
is
in
the
rooirand
there
is
a
devil
dwells
there
i
could
get
no
more
out
of
him
beyond
the
fact
that
there
was
certainly
a
great
devil
there
his
grandfather
and
father
had
seen
it
and
he
himself
had
heard
it
roaring
when
he
had
gone
there
as
a
boy
to
hunt
he
would
explain
no
further
and
went
to
bed
next
morning
close
to
sikitola
kraal
i
bade
the
farmers
after
telling
them
that
there
would
be
a
store
in
my
wagon
for
three
weeks
at
umvelos
if
they
wanted
supplies
we
then
struck
more
to
the
north
towards
our
destination
as
soon
as
they
had
gone
i
had
out
my
map
and
searched
it
for
the
name
old
coetzee
had
mentioned
it
was
a
very
bad
map
for
there
had
been
no
surveying
east
of
the
berg
and
most
of
the
names
were
mere
guesses
but
i
found
the
word
marking
an
eastern
continuation
of
the
northern
wall
and
probably
set
down
from
some
hunter
report
i
had
better
explain
here
the
chief
features
of
the
country
for
they
bulk
largely
in
my
story
the
berg
runs
north
and
south
and
from
it
run
the
chief
streams
which
water
the
plain
they
are
beginning
from
the
south
the
olifants
the
groot
letaba
the
letsitela
the
klein
letaba
and
the
klein
labongo
on
which
stands
blaauwildebeestefontein
but
the
greatest
river
of
the
plain
into
which
the
others
ultimately
flow
is
the
groot
labongo
which
appears
from
some
subterranean
source
close
to
the
place
called
umvelos
north
from
blaauwildebeestefontein
the
berg
runs
for
some
twenty
miles
and
then
makes
a
sharp
turn
eastward
becoming
according
to
my
map
the
rooirand
i
pored
over
these
details
and
was
particularly
curious
about
the
great
labongo
it
seemed
to
me
unlikely
that
a
spring
in
the
bush
could
produce
so
great
a
river
and
i
decided
that
its
source
must
lie
in
the
mountains
to
the
north
as
well
as
i
could
guess
the
rooirand
the
nearest
part
of
the
berg
was
about
thirty
miles
distant
old
coetzee
had
said
that
there
was
a
devil
in
the
place
but
i
thought
that
if
it
were
explored
the
first
thing
found
would
be
a
fine
stream
of
water
we
got
to
umvelos
after
midday
and
outspanned
for
our
three
work
i
set
the
dutchmen
to
unload
and
clear
the
ground
for
foundations
while
i
went
off
to
sikitola
to
ask
for
labourers
i
got
a
dozen
lusty
blacks
and
soon
we
had
a
encampment
and
the
work
went
on
merrily
it
was
rough
architecture
and
rougher
masonry
all
we
aimed
at
was
a
shop
with
a
kind
of
outhouse
for
stores
i
was
architect
and
watched
the
marking
out
of
the
foundations
and
the
first
few
feet
of
the
walls
sikitola
people
proved
themselves
good
helpers
and
most
of
the
building
was
left
to
them
while
the
dutchmen
worked
at
the
carpentry
bricks
ran
short
before
we
got
very
far
and
we
had
to
set
to
on
the
bank
of
the
labongo
and
finish
off
the
walls
with
green
bricks
which
gave
the
place
a
queer
piebald
look
i
was
not
much
of
a
carpenter
and
there
were
plenty
of
builders
without
me
so
i
found
a
considerable
amount
of
time
on
my
hands
at
first
i
acted
as
shopkeeper
in
the
but
i
soon
cleared
out
my
stores
to
the
dutch
farmers
and
the
natives
i
had
thought
of
going
back
for
more
and
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
profitably
give
some
of
my
leisure
to
the
rooirand
i
could
see
the
wall
of
the
mountains
quite
clear
to
the
north
within
an
easy
day
ride
so
one
morning
i
packed
enough
food
for
a
day
or
two
tied
my
on
my
saddle
and
set
off
to
explore
after
appointing
the
elder
of
the
dutchmen
foreman
of
the
job
in
my
absence
it
was
very
hot
jogging
along
the
native
path
with
the
eternal
bush
around
me
happily
there
was
no
fear
of
losing
the
way
for
the
rooirand
stood
very
clear
in
front
and
slowly
as
i
advanced
i
began
to
make
out
the
details
of
the
cliffs
at
when
i
was
about
i
sat
down
with
my
zeiss
glass
my
mother
farewell
gift
to
look
for
the
valley
but
valley
i
saw
none
the
wall
reddish
purple
it
looked
and
i
thought
of
porphyry
was
continuous
and
unbroken
there
were
chimneys
and
fissures
but
none
great
enough
to
hold
a
river
the
top
was
sheer
cliff
then
came
loose
kranzes
in
tiers
like
the
seats
in
a
gallery
and
below
a
dense
thicket
of
trees
i
raked
the
whole
line
for
a
break
but
there
seemed
none
a
bad
job
for
me
i
thought
there
is
no
water
for
i
must
pass
the
night
there
the
night
was
spent
in
a
sheltered
nook
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
but
my
horse
and
i
went
to
bed
without
a
drink
my
supper
was
some
raisins
and
biscuits
for
i
did
not
dare
to
run
the
risk
of
increasing
my
thirst
i
had
found
a
great
bank
of
sloping
up
to
the
kranzes
and
thick
wood
clothing
all
the
slope
the
grass
seemed
wonderfully
fresh
but
of
water
there
was
no
sign
there
was
not
even
the
sandy
channel
of
a
stream
to
dig
in
in
the
morning
i
had
a
difficult
problem
to
face
water
i
must
find
at
all
costs
or
i
must
go
home
there
was
time
enough
for
me
to
get
back
without
suffering
much
but
if
so
i
must
give
up
my
explorations
this
i
was
determined
not
to
do
the
more
i
looked
at
these
red
cliffs
the
more
eager
i
was
to
find
out
their
secret
there
must
be
water
somewhere
otherwise
how
account
for
the
lushness
of
the
vegetation
my
horse
was
a
veld
pony
so
i
set
him
loose
to
see
what
he
would
do
he
strayed
back
on
the
path
to
umvelos
this
looked
bad
for
it
meant
that
he
did
not
smell
water
along
the
cliff
front
if
i
was
to
find
a
stream
it
must
be
on
the
top
and
i
must
try
a
little
mountaineering
then
taking
my
courage
in
both
my
hands
i
decided
i
gave
my
pony
a
cut
and
set
him
off
on
the
homeward
road
i
knew
he
was
safe
to
get
back
in
four
or
five
hours
and
in
broad
day
there
was
little
fear
of
wild
beasts
attacking
him
i
had
tied
my
sleeping
bag
on
to
the
saddle
and
had
with
me
but
two
pocketfuls
of
food
i
had
also
fastened
on
the
saddle
a
letter
to
my
dutch
foreman
bidding
him
send
a
native
with
a
spare
horse
to
fetch
me
by
the
evening
then
i
started
off
to
look
for
a
chimney
a
boyhood
spent
on
the
cliffs
at
kirkcaple
had
made
me
a
bold
cragsman
and
the
porphyry
of
the
rooirand
clearly
gave
excellent
holds
but
i
walked
many
weary
miles
along
the
before
i
found
a
feasible
road
to
begin
with
it
was
no
light
task
to
fight
one
way
through
the
dense
undergrowth
of
the
lower
slopes
every
kind
of
lay
in
wait
for
my
skin
creepers
tripped
me
up
high
trees
shut
out
the
light
and
i
was
in
constant
fear
lest
a
black
might
appear
out
of
the
tangle
it
grew
very
hot
and
the
screes
above
the
thicket
were
blistering
to
the
touch
my
tongue
too
stuck
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
with
thirst
the
first
chimney
i
tried
ran
out
on
the
face
into
nothingness
and
i
had
to
make
a
dangerous
descent
the
second
was
a
deep
gully
but
so
choked
with
rubble
that
after
nearly
braining
myself
i
desisted
still
going
eastwards
i
found
a
sloping
ledge
which
took
me
to
a
platform
from
which
ran
a
crack
with
a
little
tree
growing
in
it
my
glass
showed
me
that
beyond
this
tree
the
crack
broadened
into
a
clearly
defined
chimney
which
led
to
the
top
if
i
can
once
reach
that
tree
i
thought
the
battle
is
won
the
crack
was
only
a
few
inches
wide
large
enough
to
let
in
an
arm
and
a
foot
and
it
ran
slantwise
up
a
perpendicular
rock
i
do
not
think
i
realized
how
bad
it
was
till
i
had
gone
too
far
to
return
then
my
foot
jammed
and
i
paused
for
breath
with
my
legs
and
arms
cramping
rapidly
i
remember
that
i
looked
to
the
west
and
saw
through
the
sweat
which
kept
dropping
into
my
eyes
that
about
half
a
mile
off
a
piece
of
cliff
which
looked
unbroken
from
the
foot
had
a
fold
in
it
to
the
right
the
darkness
of
the
fold
showed
me
that
it
was
a
deep
narrow
gully
however
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
this
for
i
was
fast
in
the
middle
of
my
confounded
crack
with
immense
labour
i
found
a
chockstone
above
my
head
and
managed
to
force
my
foot
free
the
next
few
yards
were
not
so
difficult
and
then
i
stuck
once
more
for
the
crack
suddenly
grew
shallow
as
the
cliff
bulged
out
above
me
i
had
almost
given
up
hope
when
i
saw
that
about
three
feet
above
my
head
grew
the
tree
if
i
could
reach
it
and
swing
out
i
might
hope
to
pull
myself
up
to
the
ledge
on
which
it
grew
i
confess
it
needed
all
my
courage
for
i
did
not
know
but
that
the
tree
might
be
loose
and
that
it
and
i
might
go
rattling
down
four
hundred
feet
it
was
my
only
hope
however
so
i
set
my
teeth
and
wriggling
up
a
few
inches
made
a
grab
at
it
thank
god
it
held
and
with
a
great
effort
i
pulled
my
shoulder
over
the
ledge
and
breathed
freely
my
difficulties
were
not
ended
but
the
worst
was
past
the
rest
of
the
gully
gave
me
good
and
safe
climbing
and
presently
a
very
limp
and
weary
figure
lay
on
the
it
took
me
many
minutes
to
get
back
my
breath
and
to
conquer
the
faintness
which
seized
me
as
soon
as
the
need
for
exertion
was
over
when
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
and
looked
round
i
saw
a
wonderful
prospect
it
was
a
plateau
like
the
only
covered
with
bracken
and
little
bushes
like
hazels
three
or
four
miles
off
the
ground
rose
and
a
shallow
vale
opened
but
in
the
foreground
half
a
mile
or
so
distant
a
lake
lay
gleaming
in
the
sun
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
as
i
ran
towards
it
and
doubts
of
a
mirage
haunted
me
but
it
was
no
mirage
but
a
real
lake
perhaps
three
miles
in
circumference
with
banks
a
shore
of
white
pebbles
and
clear
deep
blue
water
i
drank
my
fill
and
then
stripped
and
swam
in
the
blessed
coolness
after
that
i
ate
some
luncheon
and
sunned
myself
on
a
flat
rock
have
discovered
the
source
of
the
labongo
i
said
to
myself
will
write
to
the
royal
geographical
society
and
they
will
give
me
a
medal
i
walked
round
the
lake
to
look
for
an
outlet
a
fine
mountain
stream
came
in
at
the
north
end
and
at
the
south
end
sure
enough
a
considerable
river
debauched
my
exploring
zeal
redoubled
and
i
followed
its
course
in
a
delirium
of
expectation
it
was
a
noble
stream
clear
as
crystal
and
very
unlike
the
muddy
tropical
labongo
at
umvelos
suddenly
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
lake
the
land
seemed
to
grow
over
it
and
with
a
swirl
and
a
hollow
roar
it
disappeared
into
a
mighty
i
walked
a
few
steps
on
and
from
below
my
feet
came
the
most
uncanny
rumbling
and
groaning
then
i
knew
what
old
coetzee
devil
was
that
howled
in
the
rooirand
had
i
continued
my
walk
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
i
might
have
learned
a
secret
which
would
have
stood
me
in
good
stead
later
but
the
descent
began
to
make
me
anxious
and
i
retraced
my
steps
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
whence
i
had
come
i
was
resolved
that
nothing
would
make
me
descend
by
that
awesome
crack
so
i
kept
on
eastward
along
the
top
to
look
for
a
better
way
i
found
one
about
a
mile
farther
on
which
though
far
from
easy
had
no
special
risks
save
from
the
appalling
looseness
of
the
when
i
got
down
at
length
i
found
that
it
was
near
sunset
i
went
to
the
place
i
had
bidden
my
native
look
for
me
at
but
as
i
had
feared
there
was
no
sign
of
him
so
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
i
had
supper
and
a
pipe
and
spent
a
very
chilly
night
in
a
hole
among
the
boulders
i
got
up
at
dawn
stiff
and
cold
and
ate
a
few
raisins
for
breakfast
there
was
no
sign
of
horses
so
i
resolved
to
fill
up
the
time
in
looking
for
the
fold
of
the
cliff
which
as
i
had
seen
from
the
horrible
crack
of
yesterday
contained
a
gully
it
was
a
difficult
job
for
to
get
the
sidelong
view
of
the
cliff
i
had
to
scramble
through
the
undergrowth
of
the
slopes
again
and
even
a
certain
way
up
the
kranzes
at
length
i
got
my
bearings
and
fixed
the
place
by
some
tall
trees
in
the
bush
then
i
descended
and
walked
westwards
suddenly
as
i
neared
the
place
i
heard
the
strangest
sound
coming
from
the
rocks
it
was
a
deep
muffled
groaning
so
eerie
and
unearthly
that
for
the
moment
i
stood
and
shivered
then
i
remembered
my
river
of
yesterday
it
must
be
above
this
place
that
it
descended
into
the
earth
and
in
the
hush
of
dawn
the
sound
was
naturally
louder
no
wonder
old
coetzee
had
been
afraid
of
devils
it
reminded
me
of
the
lines
in
as
if
condemned
to
lave
some
demon
subterranean
cave
who
prisoned
by
enchanter
spell
shakes
the
dark
rock
with
groan
and
yell
while
i
was
standing
awestruck
at
the
sound
i
observed
a
figure
moving
towards
the
cliffs
i
was
well
in
cover
so
i
could
not
have
been
noticed
it
was
a
very
old
man
very
tall
but
bowed
in
the
shoulders
who
was
walking
slowly
with
bent
head
he
could
not
have
been
thirty
yards
from
me
so
i
had
a
clear
view
of
his
face
he
was
a
native
but
of
a
type
i
had
never
seen
before
a
long
white
beard
fell
on
his
breast
and
a
magnificent
kaross
of
leopard
skin
covered
his
shoulders
his
face
was
seamed
and
lined
and
shrunken
so
that
he
seemed
as
old
as
time
itself
very
carefully
i
crept
after
him
and
found
myself
opposite
the
fold
where
the
gully
was
there
was
a
clear
path
through
the
jungle
a
path
worn
smooth
by
many
feet
i
followed
it
through
the
undergrowth
and
over
the
screes
till
it
turned
inside
the
fold
of
the
gully
and
then
it
stopped
short
i
was
in
a
deep
cleft
but
in
front
was
a
slab
of
sheer
rock
above
the
gully
looked
darker
and
deeper
but
there
was
this
great
slab
to
pass
i
examined
the
sides
but
they
were
sheer
rock
with
no
openings
had
i
had
my
wits
about
me
i
would
have
gone
back
and
followed
the
spoor
noting
where
it
stopped
but
the
whole
thing
looked
black
magic
to
me
my
stomach
was
empty
and
my
enterprise
small
besides
there
was
the
terrible
moaning
of
the
imprisoned
river
in
my
ears
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
it
but
i
ran
from
that
gully
as
if
the
devil
and
all
his
angels
had
been
following
me
indeed
i
did
not
slacken
till
i
had
put
a
good
mile
between
me
and
those
uncanny
cliffs
after
that
i
set
out
to
foot
it
back
if
the
horses
would
not
come
to
me
i
must
go
to
them
i
walked
miles
in
a
vile
temper
enraged
at
my
dutchmen
my
natives
and
everybody
the
truth
is
i
had
been
frightened
and
my
pride
was
sore
about
it
it
grew
very
hot
the
sand
rose
and
choked
me
the
mopani
trees
with
their
dull
green
wearied
me
the
queens
and
jays
and
rollers
which
flew
about
the
path
seemed
to
be
there
to
mock
me
about
home
i
found
a
boy
and
two
horses
and
roundly
i
cursed
him
it
seemed
that
my
pony
had
returned
right
enough
and
the
boy
had
been
sent
to
fetch
me
he
had
got
before
sunset
the
night
before
and
there
he
had
stayed
i
discovered
from
him
that
he
was
scared
to
death
and
did
not
dare
go
any
nearer
the
rooirand
it
was
accursed
he
said
for
it
was
an
abode
of
devils
and
only
wizards
went
near
it
i
was
bound
to
admit
to
myself
that
i
could
not
blame
him
at
last
i
had
got
on
the
track
of
something
certain
about
this
mysterious
country
and
all
the
way
back
i
wondered
if
i
should
have
the
courage
to
follow
it
up
baboon
schelm
rascal
chapter
v
mr
wardlaw
has
a
premonition
a
week
later
the
building
job
was
finished
i
locked
the
door
of
the
new
store
pocketed
the
key
and
we
set
out
for
home
sikitola
was
entrusted
with
the
general
care
of
it
and
i
knew
him
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
he
would
keep
his
people
from
doing
mischief
i
left
my
empty
wagons
to
follow
at
their
leisure
and
rode
on
with
the
result
that
i
arrived
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
two
days
before
i
was
looked
for
i
stabled
my
horse
and
went
round
to
the
back
to
see
colin
i
had
left
him
at
home
in
case
of
fights
with
native
dogs
for
he
was
an
ill
beast
in
a
crowd
i
found
him
well
and
hearty
for
zeeta
had
been
looking
after
him
then
some
whim
seized
me
to
enter
the
store
through
my
bedroom
window
it
was
open
and
i
crawled
softly
in
to
find
the
room
fresh
and
clean
from
zeeta
care
the
door
was
ajar
and
hearing
voices
i
peeped
into
the
shop
japp
was
sitting
on
the
counter
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
a
big
native
the
same
whom
i
had
bundled
out
unceremoniously
i
noticed
that
the
outer
door
giving
on
the
road
was
shut
a
most
unusual
thing
in
the
afternoon
japp
had
some
small
objects
in
his
hand
and
the
two
were
evidently
arguing
about
a
price
i
had
no
intention
at
first
of
eavesdropping
and
was
just
about
to
push
the
door
open
when
something
in
japp
face
arrested
me
he
was
up
to
no
good
and
i
thought
it
my
business
to
wait
the
low
tones
went
on
for
a
little
both
men
talking
in
kaffir
and
then
japp
lifted
up
one
of
the
little
objects
between
finger
and
thumb
it
was
a
small
roundish
stone
about
the
size
of
a
bean
but
even
in
that
half
light
there
was
a
dull
lustre
in
it
at
that
i
shoved
the
door
open
and
went
in
both
men
started
as
if
they
had
been
shot
japp
went
as
white
as
his
mottled
face
permitted
the
he
gasped
and
he
dropped
the
thing
he
was
holding
i
picked
it
up
and
laid
it
on
the
counter
i
said
mr
japp
you
have
found
the
pipe
i
was
looking
for
i
congratulate
you
my
words
gave
the
old
ruffian
his
cue
yes
he
said
have
or
rather
my
friend
has
he
has
just
been
telling
me
about
it
the
kaffir
looked
miserably
uncomfortable
he
shifted
from
one
leg
to
the
other
casting
longing
glances
at
the
closed
door
tink
i
go
he
said
we
will
speak
more
i
told
him
i
thought
he
had
better
go
and
opened
the
door
for
him
then
i
bolted
it
again
and
turned
to
mr
japp
that
your
game
i
said
thought
there
was
something
funny
about
you
but
i
did
know
it
was
you
were
up
to
he
looked
as
if
he
could
kill
me
for
five
minutes
he
cursed
me
with
a
perfection
of
phrase
which
i
had
thought
beyond
him
it
was
no
he
declared
but
a
pipe
which
had
discovered
this
kind
of
country
i
said
quoting
his
own
words
you
might
as
well
expect
to
find
ocean
pearls
as
diamonds
but
scrape
in
the
spruit
if
you
like
you
maybe
find
some
garnets
he
choked
down
his
wrath
and
tried
a
new
tack
will
you
take
to
hold
your
tongue
i
make
you
a
rich
man
if
you
come
in
with
me
and
then
he
started
with
offers
which
showed
that
he
had
been
making
a
good
thing
out
of
the
traffic
i
stalked
over
to
him
and
took
him
by
the
shoulder
old
reprobate
i
roared
you
breathe
such
a
proposal
to
me
again
tie
you
up
like
a
sack
and
carry
you
to
pietersdorp
at
this
he
broke
down
and
wept
maudlin
tears
disgusting
to
witness
he
said
he
was
an
old
man
who
had
always
lived
honestly
and
it
would
break
his
heart
if
his
grey
hairs
were
to
be
disgraced
as
he
sat
rocking
himself
with
his
hands
over
his
face
i
saw
his
wicked
little
eyes
peering
through
the
slits
of
his
fingers
to
see
what
my
next
move
would
be
here
mr
japp
i
said
not
a
police
spy
and
it
no
business
of
mine
to
inform
against
you
i
willing
to
keep
you
out
of
gaol
but
it
must
be
on
my
own
conditions
the
first
is
that
you
resign
this
job
and
clear
out
you
will
write
to
mr
colles
a
letter
at
my
dictation
saying
that
you
find
the
work
too
much
for
you
the
second
is
that
for
the
time
you
remain
here
the
diamond
business
must
utterly
cease
if
or
anybody
like
him
comes
inside
the
store
and
if
i
get
the
slightest
hint
that
you
back
at
the
trade
in
you
go
to
pietersdorp
i
not
going
to
have
my
name
disgraced
by
being
associated
with
you
the
third
condition
is
that
when
you
leave
this
place
you
go
clear
away
if
you
come
within
twenty
miles
of
blaauwildebeestefontein
and
i
find
you
i
will
give
you
up
he
groaned
and
writhed
at
my
terms
but
in
the
end
accepted
them
he
wrote
the
letter
and
i
posted
it
i
had
no
pity
for
the
old
scamp
who
had
feathered
his
nest
well
small
wonder
that
the
firm
business
was
not
as
good
as
it
might
be
when
japp
was
giving
most
of
his
time
to
buying
diamonds
from
native
thieves
the
secret
put
him
in
the
power
of
any
kaffir
who
traded
him
a
stone
no
wonder
he
cringed
to
ruffians
like
the
second
thing
i
did
was
to
shift
my
quarters
mr
wardlaw
had
a
spare
room
which
he
had
offered
me
before
and
now
i
accepted
it
i
wanted
to
be
no
more
mixed
up
with
japp
than
i
could
help
for
i
did
not
know
what
villainy
he
might
let
me
in
for
moreover
i
carried
zeeta
with
me
being
ashamed
to
leave
her
at
the
mercy
of
the
old
bully
japp
went
up
to
the
huts
and
hired
a
slattern
to
mind
his
house
and
then
drank
heavily
for
three
days
to
console
himself
that
night
i
sat
smoking
with
mr
wardlaw
in
his
where
a
welcome
fire
burned
for
the
nights
on
the
berg
were
chilly
i
remember
the
occasion
well
for
the
queer
turn
the
conversation
took
wardlaw
as
i
have
said
had
been
working
like
a
slave
at
the
kaffir
tongues
i
talked
a
kind
of
zulu
well
enough
to
make
myself
understood
and
i
could
follow
it
when
spoken
but
he
had
real
scholarship
in
the
thing
and
knew
all
about
the
grammar
and
the
different
dialects
further
he
had
read
a
lot
about
native
history
and
was
full
of
the
doings
of
tchaka
and
mosilikatse
and
moshesh
and
the
kings
of
old
having
little
to
do
in
the
way
of
teaching
he
had
made
up
for
it
by
reading
omnivorously
he
used
to
borrow
books
from
the
missionaries
and
he
must
have
spent
half
his
salary
in
buying
new
ones
as
he
sat
and
puffed
in
his
armchair
he
was
full
of
stories
about
a
fellow
called
monomotapa
it
seems
he
was
a
great
black
emperor
whom
the
portuguese
discovered
about
the
sixteenth
century
he
lived
to
the
north
in
mashonaland
and
had
a
mountain
full
of
gold
the
portuguese
did
not
make
much
of
him
but
they
got
his
son
and
turned
him
into
a
priest
i
told
wardlaw
that
he
was
most
likely
only
a
petty
chief
whose
exploits
were
magnified
by
distance
the
same
as
the
caciques
in
mexico
but
the
schoolmaster
would
not
accept
this
must
have
been
a
big
man
davie
you
know
that
the
old
ruins
in
rhodesia
called
zimbabwe
were
long
believed
to
be
phoenician
in
origin
i
have
a
book
here
which
tells
all
about
them
but
now
it
is
believed
that
they
were
built
by
natives
i
maintain
that
the
men
who
could
erect
piles
like
that
and
he
showed
me
a
picture
something
more
than
petty
chiefs
presently
the
object
of
this
conversation
appeared
mr
wardlaw
thought
that
we
were
underrating
the
capacity
of
the
native
this
opinion
was
natural
enough
in
a
schoolmaster
but
not
in
the
precise
form
wardlaw
put
it
it
was
not
his
intelligence
which
he
thought
we
underrated
but
his
dangerousness
his
reasons
shortly
were
these
there
were
five
or
six
of
them
to
every
white
man
they
were
all
roughly
speaking
of
the
same
stock
with
the
same
tribal
beliefs
they
had
only
just
ceased
being
a
warrior
race
with
a
powerful
military
discipline
and
most
important
they
lived
round
the
rim
of
the
plateau
and
if
they
combined
could
cut
off
the
white
man
from
the
sea
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
time
before
we
opened
the
road
again
he
said
think
of
what
would
happen
before
then
think
of
the
lonely
farms
and
the
little
dorps
wiped
out
of
the
map
it
would
be
a
second
and
bloodier
indian
mutiny
not
saying
it
likely
he
went
on
i
maintain
it
possible
supposing
a
second
tchaka
turned
up
who
could
get
the
different
tribes
to
work
together
it
would
be
so
very
hard
to
smuggle
in
arms
think
of
the
long
unwatched
coast
in
gazaland
and
tongaland
if
they
got
a
leader
with
prestige
enough
to
organize
a
crusade
against
the
white
man
i
do
see
what
could
prevent
a
rising
should
get
wind
of
it
in
time
to
crush
it
at
the
start
i
said
not
so
sure
they
are
cunning
fellows
and
have
arts
that
we
know
nothing
about
you
have
heard
of
native
telepathy
they
can
send
news
over
a
thousand
miles
as
quick
as
the
telegraph
and
we
have
no
means
of
tapping
the
wires
if
they
ever
combined
they
could
keep
it
as
secret
as
the
grave
my
houseboy
might
be
in
the
rising
and
i
would
never
suspect
it
till
one
fine
morning
he
cut
my
throat
they
would
never
find
a
leader
if
there
was
some
exiled
prince
of
tchaka
blood
who
came
back
like
prince
charlie
to
free
his
people
there
might
be
danger
but
their
royalties
are
fat
men
with
top
hats
and
old
who
live
in
dirty
locations
wardlaw
admitted
this
but
said
that
there
might
be
other
kinds
of
leaders
he
had
been
reading
a
lot
about
ethiopianism
which
educated
american
negroes
had
been
trying
to
preach
in
south
africa
he
did
not
see
why
a
kind
of
bastard
christianity
should
not
be
the
motive
of
a
rising
kaffir
finds
it
an
easy
job
to
mix
up
christian
emotion
and
pagan
practice
look
at
hayti
and
some
of
the
performances
in
the
southern
states
then
he
shook
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
leaned
forward
with
a
solemn
face
admit
the
truth
to
you
davie
i
black
afraid
he
looked
so
earnest
and
serious
sitting
there
with
his
eyes
peering
at
me
that
i
could
not
help
being
impressed
is
the
matter
i
asked
anything
happened
he
shook
his
head
i
can
put
a
name
to
but
i
have
a
presentiment
that
some
mischief
is
afoot
in
these
hills
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
i
confess
i
was
startled
by
these
words
you
must
remember
that
i
had
never
given
a
hint
of
my
suspicions
to
mr
wardlaw
beyond
asking
him
if
a
wizard
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
a
question
anybody
might
have
put
but
here
was
the
schoolmaster
discovering
for
himself
some
mystery
in
blaauwildebeestefontein
i
tried
to
get
at
his
evidence
but
it
was
very
little
he
thought
there
were
an
awful
lot
of
blacks
about
woods
are
full
of
them
he
said
i
gathered
he
did
not
imagine
he
was
being
spied
on
but
merely
felt
that
there
were
more
natives
about
than
could
be
explained
another
thing
he
said
native
bairns
have
all
left
the
school
i
only
three
scholars
left
and
they
are
from
dutch
farms
i
went
to
majinje
to
find
out
what
was
up
and
an
old
crone
told
me
the
place
was
full
of
bad
men
i
tell
you
davie
there
something
brewing
and
that
something
is
not
good
for
us
there
was
nothing
new
to
me
in
what
wardlaw
had
to
tell
and
yet
that
talk
late
at
night
by
a
dying
fire
made
me
feel
afraid
for
the
second
time
since
i
had
come
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
i
had
a
clue
and
had
been
on
the
for
mysteries
but
that
another
should
feel
the
strangeness
for
himself
made
it
seem
desperately
real
to
me
of
course
i
scoffed
at
mr
wardlaw
fears
i
could
not
have
him
spoiling
all
my
plans
by
crying
up
a
native
rising
for
which
he
had
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
you
been
writing
to
anybody
i
asked
him
he
said
that
he
had
told
no
one
but
he
meant
to
unless
things
got
better
have
the
nerve
for
this
job
davie
he
said
have
to
resign
and
it
a
pity
for
the
place
suits
my
health
fine
you
see
i
know
too
much
and
i
have
your
whinstone
nerve
and
total
lack
of
imagination
i
told
him
that
it
was
simply
fancy
and
came
from
reading
too
many
books
and
taking
too
little
exercise
but
i
made
him
promise
to
say
nothing
to
anybody
either
by
word
of
mouth
or
letter
without
telling
me
first
then
i
made
him
a
rummer
of
toddy
and
sent
him
to
bed
a
trifle
comforted
the
first
thing
i
did
in
my
new
room
was
to
shift
the
bed
into
the
corner
out
of
line
with
the
window
there
were
no
shutters
so
i
put
up
an
old
and
jammed
it
between
the
window
frames
also
i
loaded
my
and
kept
it
by
my
bedside
had
wardlaw
seen
these
preparations
he
might
have
thought
more
of
my
imagination
and
less
of
my
nerve
it
was
a
real
comfort
to
me
to
put
out
a
hand
in
the
darkness
and
feel
colin
shaggy
coat
chapter
vi
the
drums
beat
at
sunset
japp
was
drunk
for
the
next
day
or
two
and
i
had
the
business
of
the
store
to
myself
i
was
glad
of
this
for
it
gave
me
leisure
to
reflect
upon
the
various
perplexities
of
my
situation
as
i
have
said
i
was
really
scared
more
out
of
a
sense
of
impotence
than
from
dread
of
actual
danger
i
was
in
a
fog
of
uncertainty
things
were
happening
around
me
which
i
could
only
dimly
guess
at
and
i
had
no
power
to
take
one
step
in
defence
that
wardlaw
should
have
felt
the
same
without
any
hint
from
me
was
the
final
proof
that
the
mystery
was
no
figment
of
my
nerves
i
had
written
to
colles
and
got
no
answer
now
the
letter
with
japp
resignation
in
it
had
gone
to
durban
surely
some
notice
would
be
taken
of
that
if
i
was
given
the
post
colles
was
bound
to
consider
what
i
had
said
in
my
earlier
letter
and
give
me
some
directions
meanwhile
it
was
my
business
to
stick
to
my
job
till
i
was
relieved
a
change
had
come
over
the
place
during
my
absence
the
natives
had
almost
disappeared
from
sight
except
the
few
families
living
round
blaauwildebeestefontein
one
never
saw
a
native
on
the
roads
and
none
came
into
the
store
they
were
sticking
close
to
their
locations
or
else
they
had
gone
after
some
distant
business
except
a
batch
of
three
shangaans
returning
from
the
rand
i
had
nobody
in
the
store
for
the
whole
of
one
day
so
about
four
i
shut
it
up
whistled
on
colin
and
went
for
a
walk
along
the
berg
if
there
were
no
natives
on
the
road
there
were
plenty
in
the
bush
i
had
the
impression
of
which
wardlaw
had
spoken
that
the
native
population
of
the
countryside
had
suddenly
been
hugely
increased
the
woods
were
simply
with
them
i
was
being
spied
on
as
before
but
now
there
were
so
many
at
the
business
that
they
could
not
all
conceal
their
tracks
every
now
and
then
i
had
a
glimpse
of
a
black
shoulder
or
leg
and
colin
whom
i
kept
on
the
leash
was
with
excitement
i
had
seen
all
i
wanted
and
went
home
with
a
preoccupied
mind
i
sat
long
on
wardlaw
trying
to
puzzle
out
the
truth
of
this
spying
what
perplexed
me
was
that
i
had
been
left
unmolested
when
i
had
gone
to
umvelos
now
as
i
conjectured
the
secret
of
the
neighbourhood
whatever
it
was
was
probably
connected
with
the
rooirand
but
when
i
had
ridden
in
that
direction
and
had
spent
two
days
in
exploring
no
one
had
troubled
to
watch
me
i
was
quite
certain
about
this
for
my
eye
had
grown
quick
to
note
espionage
and
it
is
harder
for
a
spy
to
hide
in
the
spare
bush
of
the
flats
than
in
the
dense
thickets
on
these
uplands
the
watchers
then
did
not
mind
my
fossicking
round
their
sacred
place
why
then
was
i
so
closely
watched
in
the
harmless
neighbourhood
of
the
store
i
thought
for
a
long
time
before
an
answer
occurred
to
me
the
reason
must
be
that
going
to
the
plains
i
was
going
into
native
country
and
away
from
civilization
but
blaauwildebeestefontein
was
near
the
frontier
there
must
be
some
dark
business
brewing
of
which
they
may
have
feared
that
i
had
an
inkling
they
wanted
to
see
if
i
proposed
to
go
to
pietersdorp
or
wesselsburg
and
tell
what
i
knew
and
they
clearly
were
resolved
that
i
should
not
i
laughed
i
remember
thinking
that
they
had
forgotten
the
but
then
i
reflected
that
i
knew
nothing
of
what
might
be
happening
daily
to
the
when
i
had
reached
this
conclusion
my
first
impulse
was
to
test
it
by
riding
straight
west
on
the
main
road
if
i
was
right
i
should
certainly
be
stopped
on
second
thoughts
however
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
flinging
up
the
game
prematurely
and
i
resolved
to
wait
a
day
or
two
before
acting
next
day
nothing
happened
save
that
my
sense
of
loneliness
increased
i
felt
that
i
was
being
hemmed
in
by
barbarism
and
cut
off
in
a
ghoulish
land
from
the
succour
of
my
own
kind
i
only
kept
my
courage
up
by
the
necessity
of
presenting
a
brave
face
to
mr
wardlaw
who
was
by
this
time
in
a
very
broken
condition
of
nerves
i
had
often
thought
that
it
was
my
duty
to
advise
him
to
leave
and
to
see
him
safely
off
but
i
shrank
from
severing
myself
from
my
only
friend
i
thought
too
of
the
few
dutch
farmers
within
riding
distance
and
had
half
a
mind
to
visit
them
but
they
were
far
off
over
the
plateau
and
could
know
little
of
my
anxieties
the
third
day
events
moved
faster
japp
was
sober
and
wonderfully
quiet
he
gave
me
quite
in
a
friendly
tone
and
set
to
posting
up
the
books
as
if
he
had
never
misbehaved
in
his
days
i
was
so
busy
with
my
thoughts
that
i
too
must
have
been
gentler
than
usual
and
the
morning
passed
like
a
honeymoon
till
i
went
across
to
dinner
i
was
just
sitting
down
when
i
remembered
that
i
had
left
my
watch
in
my
waistcoat
behind
the
counter
and
started
to
go
back
for
it
but
at
the
door
i
stopped
short
for
two
horsemen
had
drawn
up
before
the
store
one
was
a
native
with
what
i
took
to
be
the
other
was
a
small
slim
man
with
a
sun
helmet
who
was
slowly
dismounting
something
in
the
cut
of
his
jib
struck
me
as
familiar
i
slipped
into
the
empty
schoolroom
and
stared
hard
then
as
he
in
handing
his
bridle
to
the
kaffir
i
got
a
sight
of
his
face
it
was
my
former
shipmate
henriques
he
said
something
to
his
companion
and
entered
the
store
you
may
imagine
that
my
curiosity
ran
to
my
first
impulse
was
to
march
over
for
my
waistcoat
and
make
a
third
with
japp
at
the
interview
happily
i
reflected
in
time
that
henriques
knew
my
face
for
i
had
grown
no
beard
having
a
great
dislike
to
needless
hair
if
he
was
one
of
the
villains
in
the
drama
he
would
mark
me
down
for
his
vengeance
once
he
knew
i
was
here
whereas
at
present
he
had
probably
forgotten
all
about
me
besides
if
i
walked
in
boldly
i
would
get
no
news
if
japp
and
he
had
a
secret
they
would
not
blab
it
in
my
presence
my
next
idea
was
to
slip
in
by
the
back
to
the
room
i
had
once
lived
in
but
how
was
i
to
cross
the
road
it
ran
white
and
dry
some
distance
each
way
in
full
view
of
the
kaffir
with
the
horses
further
the
store
stood
on
a
bare
patch
and
it
would
be
a
hard
job
to
get
in
by
the
back
assuming
as
i
believed
that
the
neighbourhood
was
thick
with
spies
the
upshot
was
that
i
got
my
glasses
and
turned
them
on
the
store
the
door
was
open
and
so
was
the
window
in
the
gloom
of
the
interior
i
made
out
henriques
legs
he
was
standing
by
the
counter
and
apparently
talking
to
japp
he
moved
to
shut
the
door
and
came
back
inside
my
focus
opposite
the
window
there
he
stayed
for
maybe
ten
minutes
while
i
hugged
my
impatience
i
would
have
given
a
hundred
pounds
to
be
snug
in
my
old
room
with
japp
thinking
me
out
of
the
store
suddenly
the
legs
twitched
up
and
his
boots
appeared
above
the
counter
japp
had
invited
him
to
his
bedroom
and
the
game
was
now
to
be
played
beyond
my
ken
this
was
more
than
i
could
stand
so
i
stole
out
at
the
back
door
and
took
to
the
thickest
bush
on
the
hillside
my
notion
was
to
cross
the
road
half
a
mile
down
when
it
had
dropped
into
the
defile
of
the
stream
and
then
to
come
swiftly
up
the
edge
of
the
water
so
as
to
effect
a
back
entrance
into
the
store
as
fast
as
i
dared
i
tore
through
the
bush
and
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
reached
the
point
i
was
making
for
then
i
bore
down
to
the
road
and
was
in
the
scrub
about
ten
yards
off
it
when
the
clatter
of
horses
pulled
me
up
again
peeping
out
i
saw
that
it
was
my
friend
and
his
kaffir
follower
who
were
riding
at
a
very
good
pace
for
the
plains
toilfully
and
crossly
i
returned
on
my
tracks
to
my
dinner
whatever
the
purport
of
their
talk
japp
and
the
portuguese
had
not
taken
long
over
it
in
the
store
that
afternoon
i
said
casually
to
japp
that
i
had
noticed
visitors
at
the
door
during
my
dinner
hour
the
old
man
looked
me
frankly
enough
in
the
face
it
was
mr
hendricks
he
said
and
explained
that
the
man
was
a
portuguese
trader
from
delagoa
way
who
had
a
lot
of
kaffir
stores
east
of
the
lebombo
hills
i
asked
his
business
and
was
told
that
he
always
gave
japp
a
call
in
when
he
was
passing
you
take
every
man
that
calls
into
your
bedroom
and
shut
the
door
i
asked
japp
lost
colour
and
his
lip
trembled
swear
to
god
mr
crawfurd
i
been
doing
nothing
wrong
i
kept
the
promise
i
gave
you
like
an
oath
to
my
mother
i
see
you
suspect
me
and
maybe
you
cause
but
i
be
quite
honest
with
you
i
have
dealt
in
diamonds
before
this
with
hendricks
but
when
he
asked
me
i
told
him
that
that
business
was
off
i
only
took
him
to
my
room
to
give
him
a
drink
he
likes
brandy
and
there
no
supply
in
the
shop
i
distrusted
japp
wholeheartedly
enough
but
i
was
convinced
that
in
this
case
he
spoke
the
truth
the
man
any
news
i
asked
had
and
he
had
said
japp
was
always
a
sullen
beggar
and
never
spoke
much
but
he
said
one
queer
thing
he
asked
me
if
i
was
going
to
retire
and
when
i
told
him
yes
he
said
i
had
put
it
off
rather
long
i
told
him
i
was
as
healthy
as
i
ever
was
and
he
laughed
in
his
dirty
portugoose
way
yes
mr
japp
he
says
but
the
country
is
not
so
healthy
i
wonder
what
the
chap
meant
he
be
dead
of
blackwater
before
many
months
to
judge
by
his
eyes
this
talk
satisfied
me
about
japp
who
was
clearly
in
desperate
fear
of
offending
me
and
disinclined
to
return
for
the
present
to
his
old
ways
but
i
think
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
was
the
most
wretched
time
in
my
existence
it
was
as
plain
as
daylight
that
we
were
in
for
some
grave
trouble
trouble
to
which
i
believed
that
i
alone
held
any
kind
of
clue
i
had
a
pile
of
evidence
the
visit
of
henriques
was
the
last
bit
which
pointed
to
some
great
secret
approaching
its
disclosure
i
thought
that
that
disclosure
meant
blood
and
ruin
but
i
knew
nothing
definite
if
the
commander
of
a
british
army
had
come
to
me
then
and
there
and
offered
help
i
could
have
done
nothing
only
asked
him
to
wait
like
me
the
peril
whatever
it
was
did
not
threaten
me
only
though
i
and
wardlaw
and
japp
might
be
the
first
to
suffer
but
i
had
a
terrible
feeling
that
i
alone
could
do
something
to
ward
it
off
and
just
what
that
something
was
i
could
not
tell
i
was
horribly
afraid
not
only
of
unknown
death
but
of
my
impotence
to
play
any
manly
part
i
was
alone
knowing
too
much
and
yet
too
little
and
there
was
no
chance
of
help
under
the
broad
sky
i
cursed
myself
for
not
writing
to
aitken
at
lourenco
marques
weeks
before
he
had
promised
to
come
up
and
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
kept
his
word
in
the
late
afternoon
i
dragged
wardlaw
out
for
a
walk
in
his
presence
i
had
to
keep
up
a
forced
cheerfulness
and
i
believe
the
pretence
did
me
good
we
took
a
path
up
the
berg
among
groves
of
stinkwood
and
essenwood
where
a
failing
stream
made
an
easy
route
it
may
have
been
fancy
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
wood
was
emptier
and
that
we
were
followed
less
closely
i
remember
it
was
a
lovely
evening
and
in
the
clear
fragrant
gloaming
every
foreland
of
the
berg
stood
out
like
a
great
ship
above
the
dark
green
sea
of
the
bush
when
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
plateau
we
saw
the
sun
sinking
between
two
far
blue
peaks
in
makapan
country
and
away
to
the
south
the
great
roll
of
the
high
veld
i
longed
miserably
for
the
places
where
white
men
were
thronged
together
in
dorps
and
cities
as
we
gazed
a
curious
sound
struck
our
ears
it
seemed
to
begin
far
up
in
the
north
a
low
roll
like
the
combing
of
breakers
on
the
sand
then
it
grew
louder
and
travelled
nearer
a
roll
with
sudden
spasms
of
harsher
sound
in
it
reminding
me
of
the
churning
in
one
of
the
of
kirkcaple
cliffs
presently
it
grew
softer
again
as
the
sound
passed
south
but
new
notes
were
always
emerging
the
echo
came
sometimes
as
it
were
from
stark
rock
and
sometimes
from
the
deep
gloom
of
the
forests
i
have
never
heard
an
eerier
sound
neither
natural
nor
human
it
seemed
but
the
voice
of
that
world
between
which
is
hid
from
man
sight
and
hearing
mr
wardlaw
clutched
my
arm
and
in
that
moment
i
guessed
the
explanation
the
native
drums
were
beating
passing
some
message
from
the
far
north
down
the
line
of
the
berg
where
the
locations
were
thickest
to
the
great
black
population
of
the
south
that
means
war
mr
wardlaw
cried
means
nothing
of
the
kind
i
said
shortly
their
way
of
sending
news
it
as
likely
to
be
some
change
in
the
weather
or
an
outbreak
of
cattle
disease
when
we
got
home
i
found
japp
with
a
face
like
grey
paper
you
hear
the
drums
asked
i
said
shortly
about
them
forgive
you
for
an
ignorant
britisher
he
almost
shouted
may
hear
drums
any
night
but
a
drumming
like
that
i
only
once
heard
before
it
was
in
in
the
valley
do
you
know
what
happened
next
day
cetewayo
impis
came
over
the
hills
and
in
an
hour
there
was
a
living
white
soul
in
the
glen
two
men
escaped
and
one
of
them
was
called
peter
japp
are
in
god
hands
then
and
must
wait
on
his
will
i
said
solemnly
there
was
no
more
sleep
for
wardlaw
and
myself
that
night
we
made
the
best
barricade
we
could
of
the
windows
loaded
all
our
weapons
and
trusted
to
colin
to
give
us
early
news
before
supper
i
went
over
to
get
japp
to
join
us
but
found
that
that
worthy
had
sought
help
from
his
old
protector
the
bottle
and
was
already
sound
asleep
with
both
door
and
window
open
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
death
was
certain
and
yet
my
heart
belied
my
conviction
and
i
could
not
feel
the
appropriate
mood
if
anything
i
was
more
cheerful
since
i
had
heard
the
drums
it
was
clearly
now
beyond
the
power
of
me
or
any
man
to
stop
the
march
of
events
my
thoughts
ran
on
a
native
rising
and
i
kept
telling
myself
how
little
that
was
probable
where
were
the
arms
the
leader
the
discipline
at
any
rate
such
arguments
put
me
to
sleep
before
dawn
and
i
wakened
at
eight
to
find
that
nothing
had
happened
the
clear
morning
sunlight
as
of
old
made
blaauwildebeestefontein
the
place
of
a
dream
zeeta
brought
in
my
cup
of
coffee
as
if
this
day
were
just
like
all
others
my
pipe
tasted
as
sweet
the
fresh
air
from
the
berg
blew
as
fragrantly
on
my
brow
i
went
over
to
the
store
in
reasonably
good
spirits
leaving
wardlaw
busy
on
the
penitential
psalms
the
had
brought
the
mail
as
usual
and
there
was
one
private
letter
for
me
i
opened
it
with
great
excitement
for
the
envelope
bore
the
stamp
of
the
firm
at
last
colles
had
deigned
to
answer
inside
was
a
sheet
of
the
firm
notepaper
with
the
signature
of
colles
across
the
top
below
some
one
had
pencilled
these
five
words
blesbok
are
changing
i
looked
to
see
that
japp
had
not
suffocated
himself
then
shut
up
the
store
and
went
back
to
my
room
to
think
out
this
new
mystification
the
thing
had
come
from
colles
for
it
was
the
private
notepaper
of
the
durban
office
and
there
was
colles
signature
but
the
pencilling
was
in
a
different
hand
my
deduction
from
this
was
that
some
one
wished
to
send
me
a
message
and
that
colles
had
given
that
some
one
a
sheet
of
signed
paper
to
serve
as
a
kind
of
introduction
i
might
take
it
therefore
that
the
scribble
was
colles
reply
to
my
letter
now
my
argument
continued
if
the
unknown
person
saw
fit
to
send
me
a
message
it
could
not
be
merely
one
of
warning
colles
must
have
told
him
that
i
was
awake
to
some
danger
and
as
i
was
in
blaauwildebeestefontein
i
must
be
nearer
the
heart
of
things
than
any
one
else
the
message
must
therefore
be
in
the
nature
of
some
password
which
i
was
to
remember
when
i
heard
it
again
i
reasoned
the
whole
thing
out
very
clearly
and
i
saw
no
gap
in
my
logic
i
can
not
describe
how
that
scribble
had
heartened
me
i
felt
no
more
the
crushing
isolation
of
yesterday
there
were
others
beside
me
in
the
secret
help
must
be
on
the
way
and
the
letter
was
the
first
tidings
but
how
near
that
was
the
question
and
it
occurred
to
me
for
the
first
time
to
look
at
the
postmark
i
went
back
to
the
store
and
got
the
envelope
out
of
the
basket
the
postmark
was
certainly
not
durban
the
stamp
was
a
cape
colony
one
and
of
the
mark
i
could
only
read
three
letters
this
was
no
sort
of
clue
and
i
turned
the
thing
over
completely
baffled
then
i
noticed
that
there
was
no
mark
of
the
post
town
of
delivery
our
letters
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
came
through
pietersdorp
and
bore
that
mark
i
compared
the
envelope
with
others
they
all
had
a
circle
and
in
broad
black
letters
but
this
envelope
had
nothing
except
the
stamp
i
was
still
slow
at
detective
work
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
the
explanation
flashed
on
me
the
letter
had
never
been
posted
at
all
the
stamp
was
a
fake
and
had
been
borrowed
from
an
old
envelope
there
was
only
one
way
in
which
it
could
have
come
it
must
have
been
put
in
the
while
the
postman
was
on
his
way
from
pietersdorp
my
unknown
friend
must
therefore
be
somewhere
within
eighty
miles
of
me
i
hurried
off
to
look
for
the
but
he
had
started
back
an
hour
before
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
on
the
coming
of
the
unknown
that
afternoon
i
again
took
mr
wardlaw
for
a
walk
it
is
an
ingrained
habit
of
mine
that
i
never
tell
anyone
more
of
a
business
than
is
practically
necessary
for
months
i
had
kept
all
my
knowledge
to
myself
and
breathed
not
a
word
to
a
soul
but
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
tell
wardlaw
about
the
letter
to
let
him
see
that
we
were
not
forgotten
i
am
afraid
it
did
not
encourage
his
mind
occult
messages
seemed
to
him
only
the
last
proof
of
a
deadly
danger
encompassing
us
and
i
could
not
shake
his
opinion
we
took
the
same
road
to
the
crown
of
the
berg
and
i
was
confirmed
in
my
suspicion
that
the
woods
were
empty
and
the
watchers
gone
the
place
was
as
deserted
as
the
bush
at
umvelos
when
we
reached
the
summit
about
sunset
we
waited
anxiously
for
the
sound
of
drums
it
came
as
we
expected
louder
and
more
menacing
than
before
wardlaw
stood
pinching
my
arm
as
the
great
tattoo
swept
down
the
escarpment
and
died
away
in
the
far
mountains
beyond
the
olifants
yet
it
no
longer
seemed
to
be
a
wall
of
sound
shutting
us
out
from
our
kindred
in
the
west
a
message
had
pierced
the
wall
if
the
blesbok
were
changing
ground
i
believed
that
the
hunters
were
calling
out
their
hounds
and
getting
ready
for
the
chase
a
species
of
buck
chapter
vii
captain
arcoll
tells
a
tale
it
froze
in
the
night
harder
than
was
common
on
the
berg
even
in
winter
and
as
i
crossed
the
road
next
morning
it
was
covered
with
rime
all
my
fears
had
gone
and
my
mind
was
strung
high
with
expectation
five
pencilled
words
may
seem
a
small
thing
to
build
hope
on
but
it
was
enough
for
me
and
i
went
about
my
work
in
the
store
with
a
reasonably
light
heart
one
of
the
first
things
i
did
was
to
take
stock
of
our
armoury
there
were
five
sporting
mausers
of
a
cheap
make
one
mauser
pistol
a
carbine
and
a
little
revolver
there
was
also
japp
an
old
hammered
as
well
as
the
gun
i
had
brought
out
with
me
there
was
a
good
supply
of
cartridges
including
a
stock
for
a
express
which
could
not
be
found
i
pocketed
the
revolver
and
searched
till
i
discovered
a
good
if
fighting
was
in
prospect
i
might
as
well
look
to
my
arms
all
the
morning
i
sat
among
flour
and
sugar
possessing
my
soul
in
as
much
patience
as
i
could
command
nothing
came
down
the
white
road
from
the
west
the
sun
melted
the
rime
the
flies
came
out
and
buzzed
in
the
window
japp
got
himself
out
of
bed
brewed
strong
coffee
and
went
back
to
his
slumbers
presently
it
was
and
i
went
over
to
a
silent
meal
with
wardlaw
when
i
returned
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
over
a
pipe
for
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
blinking
drowsily
at
the
patch
of
sun
in
the
door
and
listening
for
footsteps
in
the
dead
stillness
of
the
afternoon
i
thought
i
could
discern
a
shuffling
in
the
dust
i
got
up
and
looked
out
and
there
sure
enough
was
some
one
coming
down
the
road
but
it
was
only
a
kaffir
and
a
object
at
that
i
had
never
seen
such
an
anatomy
it
was
a
very
old
man
bent
almost
double
and
clad
in
a
ragged
shirt
and
a
pair
of
foul
khaki
trousers
he
carried
an
iron
pot
and
a
few
belongings
were
tied
up
in
a
dirty
handkerchief
he
must
have
been
a
smoker
for
he
coughed
hideously
twisting
his
body
with
the
paroxysms
i
had
seen
the
type
before
the
old
native
who
had
no
kin
to
support
him
and
no
tribe
to
shelter
him
they
wander
about
the
roads
cooking
their
wretched
meals
by
their
little
fires
till
one
morning
they
are
found
stiff
under
a
bush
the
native
gave
me
a
in
kaffir
then
begged
for
tobacco
or
a
handful
of
i
asked
him
where
he
came
from
the
west
inkoos
he
said
before
that
from
the
south
it
is
a
sore
road
for
old
bones
i
went
into
the
store
to
fetch
some
meal
and
when
i
came
out
he
had
shuffled
close
to
the
door
he
had
kept
his
eyes
on
the
ground
but
now
he
looked
up
at
me
and
i
thought
he
had
very
bright
eyes
for
such
an
old
wreck
nights
are
cold
inkoos
he
wailed
my
folk
are
scattered
and
i
have
no
kraal
the
aasvogels
follow
me
and
i
can
hear
the
blesbok
about
the
blesbok
i
asked
with
a
start
blesbok
are
changing
ground
he
said
and
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
where
are
the
hunters
i
asked
are
here
and
behind
me
he
said
in
english
holding
out
his
pot
for
my
meal
while
he
began
to
edge
into
the
middle
of
the
road
i
followed
and
speaking
english
asked
him
if
he
knew
of
a
man
named
colles
come
from
him
young
baas
where
is
your
house
ah
the
school
there
will
be
a
way
in
by
the
back
window
see
that
it
is
open
for
i
be
there
shortly
then
lifting
up
his
voice
he
called
down
in
sesuto
all
manner
of
blessings
on
me
for
my
kindness
and
went
shuffling
down
the
sunlit
road
coughing
like
a
volcano
in
high
excitement
i
locked
up
the
store
and
went
over
to
mr
wardlaw
no
children
had
come
to
school
that
day
and
he
was
sitting
idle
playing
patience
the
door
i
said
come
into
my
room
we
on
the
brink
of
explanations
in
about
twenty
minutes
the
bush
below
the
parted
and
the
kaffir
slipped
out
he
grinned
at
me
and
after
a
glance
round
hopped
very
nimbly
over
the
sill
then
he
examined
the
window
and
pulled
the
curtains
the
outer
door
shut
he
asked
in
excellent
english
get
me
some
hot
water
and
any
spare
clothes
you
may
possess
mr
crawfurd
i
must
get
comfortable
before
we
begin
our
we
the
night
before
us
so
there
plenty
of
time
but
get
the
house
clear
and
see
that
nobody
disturbs
me
at
my
toilet
i
am
a
modest
man
and
sensitive
about
my
looks
i
brought
him
what
he
wanted
and
looked
on
at
an
amazing
transformation
taking
a
phial
from
his
bundle
he
rubbed
some
liquid
on
his
face
and
neck
and
hands
and
got
rid
of
the
black
colouring
his
body
and
legs
he
left
untouched
save
that
he
covered
them
with
shirt
and
trousers
from
my
wardrobe
then
he
pulled
off
a
scaly
wig
and
showed
beneath
it
a
head
of
grizzled
hair
in
ten
minutes
the
old
kaffir
had
been
transformed
into
an
active
man
of
maybe
fifty
years
mr
wardlaw
stared
as
if
he
had
seen
a
resurrection
had
better
introduce
myself
he
said
when
he
had
taken
the
edge
off
his
thirst
and
hunger
name
is
arcoll
captain
james
arcoll
i
am
speaking
to
mr
crawfurd
the
storekeeper
and
mr
wardlaw
the
schoolmaster
of
blaauwildebeestefontein
where
by
the
way
is
mr
peter
japp
drunk
ah
yes
it
was
always
his
failing
the
quorum
however
is
complete
without
him
by
this
time
it
was
about
sunset
and
i
remember
i
cocked
my
ear
to
hear
the
drums
beat
captain
arcoll
noticed
the
movement
as
he
noticed
all
else
listening
for
the
drums
but
you
wo
hear
them
that
business
is
over
here
they
beat
in
swaziland
and
down
into
the
tonga
border
three
days
more
unless
you
and
i
mr
crawfurd
are
extra
smart
and
they
be
hearing
them
in
durban
it
was
not
till
the
lamp
was
lit
the
fire
burning
well
and
the
house
locked
and
shuttered
that
captain
arcoll
began
his
tale
he
said
me
hear
what
you
know
colles
told
me
that
you
were
a
keen
fellow
and
had
wind
of
some
mystery
here
you
wrote
him
about
the
way
you
were
spied
on
but
i
told
him
to
take
no
notice
your
affair
mr
crawfurd
had
to
wait
on
more
urgent
matters
now
what
do
you
think
is
happening
i
spoke
very
shortly
weighing
my
words
for
i
felt
i
was
on
trial
before
these
bright
eyes
think
that
some
kind
of
native
rising
is
about
to
commence
he
said
dryly
would
and
your
evidence
would
be
the
spying
and
drumming
anything
more
have
come
on
the
tracks
of
a
lot
of
work
in
the
neighbourhood
the
natives
have
some
supply
of
diamonds
which
they
sell
bit
by
bit
and
i
do
doubt
but
they
have
been
getting
guns
with
the
proceeds
he
nodded
you
any
notion
who
has
been
engaged
in
the
job
i
had
it
on
my
tongue
to
mention
japp
but
forbore
remembering
my
promise
can
name
one
i
said
little
yellow
portugoose
who
calls
himself
henriques
or
hendricks
he
passed
by
here
the
day
before
yesterday
captain
arcoll
suddenly
was
consumed
with
quiet
laughter
you
notice
the
kaffir
who
rode
with
him
and
carried
his
saddlebags
well
he
one
of
my
men
henriques
would
have
a
fit
if
he
knew
what
was
in
those
saddlebags
they
contain
my
change
of
clothes
and
other
odds
and
ends
henriques
own
stuff
is
in
a
hole
in
the
spruit
a
handy
way
of
getting
one
luggage
sent
on
eh
the
bags
are
waiting
for
me
at
a
place
i
appointed
and
again
captain
arcoll
indulged
his
sense
of
humour
then
he
became
grave
and
returned
to
his
examination
rising
with
diamonds
as
the
sinews
of
war
and
henriques
as
the
chief
agent
well
and
good
but
who
is
to
lead
and
what
are
the
natives
going
to
rise
about
know
nothing
further
but
i
have
made
some
guesses
hear
your
guesses
he
said
blowing
smoke
rings
from
his
pipe
think
the
main
mover
is
a
great
black
minister
who
calls
himself
john
laputa
captain
arcoll
nearly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
how
on
earth
did
you
find
that
out
quick
mr
crawfurd
tell
me
all
you
know
for
this
is
desperately
important
i
began
at
the
beginning
and
told
him
the
story
of
what
happened
on
the
kirkcaple
shore
then
i
spoke
of
my
sight
of
him
on
board
ship
his
talk
with
henriques
about
blaauwildebeestefontein
and
his
hurried
departure
from
durban
captain
arcoll
listened
intently
and
at
the
mention
of
durban
he
laughed
and
i
seem
to
have
been
running
on
lines
which
nearly
touched
i
thought
i
had
grabbed
my
friend
laputa
that
night
in
durban
but
i
was
too
cocksure
and
he
slipped
off
do
you
know
mr
crawfurd
you
have
been
on
the
right
trail
long
before
me
when
did
you
say
you
saw
him
at
his
seven
years
ago
then
you
were
the
first
man
alive
to
know
the
reverend
john
in
his
true
colours
you
knew
seven
years
ago
what
i
only
found
out
last
year
that
my
story
i
said
do
know
what
the
rising
is
about
but
there
one
other
thing
i
can
tell
you
there
some
kind
of
sacred
place
for
the
kaffirs
and
i
found
out
where
it
is
i
gave
him
a
short
account
of
my
adventures
in
the
rooirand
he
smoked
silently
for
a
bit
after
i
had
finished
got
the
skeleton
of
the
whole
thing
right
and
you
only
want
the
filling
up
and
you
found
out
everything
for
yourself
colles
was
right
not
wanting
in
intelligence
mr
crawfurd
it
was
not
much
of
a
compliment
but
i
have
never
been
more
pleased
in
my
life
this
slim
grizzled
man
with
his
wrinkled
face
and
bright
eyes
was
clearly
not
lavish
in
his
praise
i
felt
it
was
no
small
thing
to
have
earned
a
word
of
commendation
now
i
will
tell
you
my
story
said
captain
arcoll
is
a
long
story
and
i
must
begin
far
back
it
has
taken
me
years
to
decipher
it
and
remember
i
been
all
my
life
at
this
native
business
i
can
talk
every
dialect
and
i
have
the
customs
of
every
tribe
by
heart
i
travelled
over
every
mile
of
south
africa
and
central
and
east
africa
too
i
was
in
both
the
matabele
wars
and
i
seen
a
heap
of
other
fighting
which
never
got
into
the
papers
so
what
i
tell
you
you
can
take
as
gospel
for
it
is
knowledge
that
was
not
learned
in
a
day
he
puffed
away
and
then
asked
suddenly
you
ever
hear
of
prester
john
man
that
lived
in
central
asia
i
asked
with
a
reminiscence
of
a
i
had
as
a
boy
no
said
mr
wardlaw
means
the
king
of
abyssinia
in
the
fifteenth
century
i
been
reading
all
about
him
he
was
a
christian
and
the
portuguese
sent
expedition
after
expedition
to
find
him
but
they
never
got
there
albuquerque
wanted
to
make
an
alliance
with
him
and
capture
the
holy
sepulchre
arcoll
nodded
the
one
i
mean
there
not
very
much
known
about
him
except
portuguese
legends
he
was
a
sort
of
christian
but
i
expect
that
his
practices
were
as
pagan
as
his
neighbours
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
a
great
conqueror
under
him
and
his
successors
the
empire
of
ethiopia
extended
far
south
of
abyssinia
away
down
to
the
great
lakes
long
did
this
power
last
i
asked
wondering
to
what
tale
this
was
prologue
a
mystery
no
scholar
has
ever
been
able
to
fathom
anyhow
the
centre
of
authority
began
to
shift
southward
and
the
warrior
tribes
moved
in
that
direction
at
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
chief
native
power
was
round
about
the
zambesi
the
mazimba
and
the
makaranga
had
come
down
from
the
lake
nyassa
quarter
and
there
was
a
strong
kingdom
in
manicaland
that
was
the
monomotapa
that
the
portuguese
thought
so
much
of
wardlaw
nodded
eagerly
the
story
was
getting
into
ground
that
he
knew
about
thing
to
remember
is
that
all
these
little
empires
thought
themselves
the
successors
of
prester
john
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
find
this
out
and
i
have
spent
days
in
the
best
libraries
in
europe
over
it
they
all
looked
back
to
a
great
king
in
the
north
whom
they
called
by
about
twenty
different
names
they
had
forgotten
about
his
christianity
but
they
remembered
that
he
was
a
conqueror
to
make
a
long
story
short
monomotapa
disappeared
in
time
and
fresh
tribes
came
down
from
the
north
and
pushed
right
down
to
natal
and
the
cape
that
is
how
the
zulus
first
appeared
they
brought
with
them
the
story
of
prester
john
but
by
this
time
it
had
ceased
to
be
a
historical
memory
and
had
become
a
religious
cult
they
worshipped
a
great
power
who
had
been
their
ancestor
and
the
favourite
zulu
word
for
him
was
umkulunkulu
the
belief
was
perverted
into
fifty
different
forms
but
this
was
the
central
creed
that
umkulunkulu
had
been
the
father
of
the
tribe
and
was
alive
as
a
spirit
to
watch
over
them
brought
more
than
a
creed
with
them
somehow
or
other
some
fetich
had
descended
from
prester
john
by
way
of
the
mazimba
and
angoni
and
makaranga
what
it
is
i
do
not
know
but
it
was
always
in
the
hands
of
the
tribe
which
for
the
moment
held
the
leadership
the
great
native
wars
of
the
sixteenth
century
which
you
can
read
about
in
the
portuguese
historians
were
not
for
territory
but
for
leadership
and
mainly
for
the
possession
of
this
fetich
anyhow
we
know
that
the
zulus
brought
it
down
with
them
they
called
it
which
means
the
great
snake
but
i
do
suppose
that
it
was
any
kind
of
snake
the
snake
was
their
totem
and
they
would
naturally
call
their
most
sacred
possession
after
it
i
will
tell
you
a
thing
that
few
know
you
have
heard
of
tchaka
he
was
a
sort
of
black
napoleon
early
in
the
last
century
and
he
made
the
zulus
the
paramount
power
in
south
africa
slaughtering
about
two
million
souls
to
accomplish
it
well
he
had
the
fetich
whatever
it
was
and
it
was
believed
that
he
owed
his
conquests
to
it
mosilikatse
tried
to
steal
it
and
that
was
why
he
had
to
fly
to
matabeleland
but
with
tchaka
it
disappeared
dingaan
did
not
have
it
nor
panda
and
cetewayo
never
got
it
though
he
searched
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
country
for
it
it
had
gone
out
of
existence
and
with
it
the
chance
of
a
kaffir
empire
captain
arcoll
got
up
to
light
his
pipe
and
i
noticed
that
his
face
was
grave
he
was
not
telling
us
this
yarn
for
our
amusement
much
for
prester
john
and
his
charm
he
said
i
have
to
take
up
the
history
at
a
different
point
in
spite
of
risings
here
and
there
and
occasional
rows
the
kaffirs
have
been
quiet
for
the
better
part
of
half
a
century
it
is
no
credit
to
us
they
have
had
plenty
of
grievances
and
we
are
no
nearer
understanding
them
than
our
fathers
were
but
they
are
scattered
and
divided
we
have
driven
great
wedges
of
white
settlement
into
their
territory
and
we
have
taken
away
their
arms
still
they
are
six
times
as
many
as
we
are
and
they
have
long
memories
and
a
thoughtful
man
may
wonder
how
long
the
peace
will
last
i
have
often
asked
myself
that
question
and
till
lately
i
used
to
reply
for
ever
because
they
can
not
find
a
leader
with
the
proper
authority
and
they
have
no
common
cause
to
fight
for
but
a
year
or
two
ago
i
began
to
change
my
mind
is
my
business
to
act
as
chief
intelligence
officer
among
the
natives
well
one
day
i
came
on
the
tracks
of
a
curious
person
he
was
a
christian
minister
called
laputa
and
he
was
going
among
the
tribes
from
durban
to
the
zambesi
as
a
roving
evangelist
i
found
that
he
made
an
enormous
impression
and
yet
the
people
i
spoke
to
were
chary
of
saying
much
about
him
presently
i
found
that
he
preached
more
than
the
gospel
his
word
was
africa
for
the
africans
and
his
chief
point
was
that
the
natives
had
had
a
great
empire
in
the
past
and
might
have
a
great
empire
again
he
used
to
tell
the
story
of
prester
john
with
all
kinds
of
embroidery
of
his
own
you
see
prester
john
was
a
good
argument
for
him
for
he
had
been
a
christian
as
well
as
a
great
potentate
years
there
has
been
plenty
of
this
talk
in
south
africa
chiefly
among
christian
kaffirs
it
is
what
they
call
ethiopianism
and
american
negroes
are
the
chief
apostles
for
myself
i
always
thought
the
thing
perfectly
harmless
i
do
care
a
fig
whether
the
native
missions
break
away
from
the
parent
churches
in
england
and
call
themselves
by
fancy
names
the
more
freedom
they
have
in
their
religious
life
the
less
they
are
likely
to
think
about
politics
but
i
soon
found
out
that
laputa
was
none
of
your
flabby
educated
negroes
from
america
and
i
began
to
watch
him
first
came
across
him
at
a
revival
meeting
in
london
where
he
was
a
great
success
he
came
and
spoke
to
me
about
my
soul
but
he
gave
up
when
i
dropped
into
zulu
the
next
time
i
met
him
was
on
the
lower
limpopo
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
trying
to
shoot
him
from
a
boat
captain
arcoll
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
laughed
at
the
recollection
had
got
on
to
an
gang
and
to
my
amazement
found
the
evangelist
among
them
but
the
reverend
john
was
too
much
for
me
he
went
overboard
in
spite
of
the
crocodiles
and
managed
to
swim
below
water
to
the
reed
bed
at
the
side
however
that
was
a
valuable
experience
for
me
for
it
gave
me
a
clue
next
saw
him
at
a
missionary
conference
in
cape
town
and
after
that
at
a
meeting
of
the
geographical
society
in
london
where
i
had
a
long
talk
with
him
my
reputation
does
not
follow
me
home
and
he
thought
i
was
an
english
publisher
with
an
interest
in
missions
you
see
i
had
no
evidence
to
connect
him
with
and
besides
i
fancied
that
his
real
game
was
something
bigger
than
that
so
i
just
bided
my
time
and
watched
did
my
best
to
get
on
to
his
dossier
but
it
was
no
easy
job
however
i
found
out
a
few
things
he
had
been
educated
in
the
states
and
well
educated
too
for
the
man
is
a
good
scholar
and
a
great
reader
besides
the
finest
natural
orator
i
have
ever
heard
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
was
of
zulu
blood
but
i
could
get
no
traces
of
his
family
he
must
come
of
high
stock
for
he
is
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
soon
i
found
it
was
no
good
following
him
in
his
excursions
into
civilization
there
he
was
merely
the
educated
kaffir
a
great
pet
of
missionary
societies
and
a
favourite
speaker
at
church
meetings
you
will
find
evidence
given
by
him
in
on
native
affairs
and
he
counted
many
members
of
parliament
at
home
among
his
correspondents
i
let
that
side
go
and
resolved
to
dog
him
when
on
his
evangelizing
tours
in
the
six
months
i
stuck
to
him
like
a
leech
i
am
pretty
good
at
disguises
and
he
never
knew
who
was
the
old
kaffir
who
squatted
in
the
dirt
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
when
he
spoke
or
the
who
called
him
sir
and
drove
his
i
had
some
queer
adventures
but
these
can
wait
the
gist
of
the
thing
is
that
after
six
months
which
turned
my
hair
grey
i
got
a
glimmering
of
what
he
was
after
he
talked
christianity
to
the
mobs
in
the
kraals
but
to
the
indunas
he
told
a
different
story
captain
arcoll
helped
himself
to
a
drink
can
guess
what
that
story
was
mr
crawfurd
at
full
moon
when
the
black
cock
was
blooded
the
reverend
john
forgot
his
christianity
he
was
back
four
centuries
among
the
mazimba
sweeping
down
on
the
zambesi
he
told
them
and
they
believed
him
that
he
was
the
umkulunkulu
the
incarnated
spirit
of
prester
john
he
told
them
that
he
was
there
to
lead
the
african
race
to
conquest
and
empire
ay
and
he
told
them
more
for
he
has
or
says
he
has
the
great
snake
itself
the
necklet
of
prester
john
neither
of
us
spoke
we
were
too
occupied
with
fitting
this
news
into
our
chain
of
knowledge
captain
arcoll
went
on
that
i
knew
his
purpose
i
set
myself
to
find
out
his
preparations
it
was
not
long
before
i
found
a
mighty
organization
at
work
from
the
zambesi
to
the
cape
the
great
tribes
were
up
to
their
necks
in
the
conspiracy
and
all
manner
of
little
sects
had
been
taken
in
i
have
sat
at
tribal
councils
and
been
sworn
a
blood
brother
and
i
have
used
the
secret
password
to
get
knowledge
in
odd
places
it
was
a
dangerous
game
and
as
i
have
said
i
had
my
adventures
but
i
came
safe
out
of
it
with
my
knowledge
first
thing
i
found
out
was
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
wealth
somewhere
among
the
tribes
much
of
it
was
in
diamonds
which
the
labourers
stole
from
the
mines
and
the
chiefs
impounded
nearly
every
tribe
had
its
secret
chest
and
our
friend
laputa
had
the
use
of
them
all
of
course
the
difficulty
was
changing
the
diamonds
into
coin
and
he
had
to
start
on
a
big
scale
your
pal
henriques
was
the
chief
agent
for
this
but
he
had
others
at
mozambique
and
johannesburg
ay
and
in
london
whom
i
have
on
my
list
with
the
money
guns
and
ammunition
were
bought
and
it
seems
that
a
pretty
flourishing
trade
has
been
going
on
for
some
time
they
came
in
mostly
overland
through
portuguese
territory
though
there
have
been
cases
of
consignments
to
johannesburg
houses
the
contents
of
which
did
not
correspond
with
the
invoice
you
ask
what
the
governments
were
doing
to
let
this
go
on
yes
and
you
may
well
ask
they
were
all
asleep
they
never
dreamed
of
danger
from
the
natives
and
in
any
case
it
was
difficult
to
police
the
portuguese
side
laputa
knew
our
weakness
and
he
staked
everything
on
it
first
scheme
was
to
lay
laputa
by
the
heels
but
no
government
would
act
on
my
information
the
man
was
strongly
buttressed
by
public
support
at
home
and
south
africa
has
burned
her
fingers
before
this
with
arbitrary
arrests
then
i
tried
to
fasten
on
him
but
i
could
not
get
my
proofs
till
too
late
i
nearly
had
him
in
durban
but
he
got
away
and
he
never
gave
me
a
second
chance
for
five
months
he
and
henriques
have
been
lying
low
because
their
scheme
was
getting
very
ripe
i
have
been
following
them
through
zululand
and
gazaland
and
i
have
discovered
that
the
train
is
ready
and
only
wants
the
match
for
a
month
i
have
never
been
more
than
five
hours
behind
him
on
the
trail
and
if
he
has
laid
his
train
i
have
laid
mine
also
arcoll
whimsical
humorous
face
had
hardened
into
grimness
and
in
his
eyes
there
was
the
light
of
a
fierce
purpose
the
sight
of
him
comforted
me
in
spite
of
his
tale
what
can
he
hope
to
do
i
asked
he
roused
every
kaffir
in
south
africa
he
would
be
beaten
you
say
he
is
an
educated
man
he
must
know
he
has
no
chance
in
the
long
run
said
he
was
an
educated
man
but
he
is
also
a
kaffir
he
can
see
the
first
stage
of
a
thing
and
maybe
the
second
but
no
more
that
is
the
native
mind
if
it
was
not
like
that
our
chance
would
be
the
worse
say
the
scheme
is
ripe
i
said
ripe
arcoll
looked
at
the
clock
half
an
hour
time
laputa
will
be
with
there
he
will
stay
the
night
morning
he
goes
to
umvelos
to
meet
henriques
evening
the
gathering
begins
question
i
said
big
a
man
is
laputa
biggest
thing
that
the
kaffirs
have
ever
produced
i
tell
you
in
my
opinion
he
is
a
great
genius
if
he
had
been
white
he
might
have
been
a
second
napoleon
he
is
a
born
leader
of
men
and
as
brave
as
a
lion
there
is
no
villainy
he
would
not
do
if
necessary
and
yet
i
should
hesitate
to
call
him
a
blackguard
ay
you
may
look
surprised
at
me
you
two
pragmatical
scotsmen
but
i
have
so
to
speak
lived
with
the
man
for
months
and
there
fineness
and
nobility
in
him
he
would
be
a
terrible
enemy
but
a
just
one
he
has
the
heart
of
a
poet
and
a
king
and
it
is
god
curse
that
he
has
been
born
among
the
children
of
ham
i
hope
to
shoot
him
like
a
dog
in
a
day
or
two
but
i
am
glad
to
bear
testimony
to
his
greatness
the
rising
starts
i
asked
you
any
of
his
plans
he
picked
up
a
map
from
the
table
and
opened
it
first
rendezvous
is
somewhere
near
sikitola
then
they
move
south
picking
up
contingents
and
the
final
concentration
is
to
be
on
the
high
veld
near
amsterdam
which
is
convenient
for
the
swazis
and
the
zulus
after
that
i
know
nothing
but
of
course
there
are
local
concentrations
along
the
whole
line
of
the
berg
from
mashonaland
to
basutoland
now
look
here
to
get
to
amsterdam
they
must
cross
the
delagoa
bay
railway
well
they
wo
be
allowed
to
if
they
get
as
far
they
will
be
scattered
there
as
i
told
you
i
too
have
laid
my
train
we
have
the
police
ready
all
along
the
scarp
of
the
berg
every
exit
from
native
territory
is
watched
and
the
frontier
farmers
are
out
on
commando
we
have
regulars
on
the
delagoa
bay
and
natal
lines
and
a
system
of
field
telegraphs
laid
which
can
summon
further
troops
to
any
point
it
has
all
been
kept
secret
because
we
are
still
in
the
dark
ourselves
the
newspaper
public
knows
nothing
about
any
rising
but
in
two
days
every
white
household
in
south
africa
will
be
in
a
panic
make
no
mistake
mr
crawfurd
this
is
a
grim
business
we
shall
smash
laputa
and
his
men
but
it
will
be
a
fierce
fight
and
there
will
be
much
good
blood
shed
besides
it
will
throw
the
country
back
another
would
to
god
i
had
been
man
enough
to
put
a
bullet
through
his
head
in
cold
blood
but
i
could
not
do
it
it
was
too
like
murder
and
maybe
i
shall
never
have
the
chance
now
one
thing
puzzles
me
i
said
makes
laputa
come
up
here
to
start
with
why
does
he
begin
with
zululand
knows
there
sure
to
be
sense
in
it
for
he
does
nothing
without
reason
we
may
know
but
as
captain
arcoll
spoke
the
real
reason
suddenly
flashed
into
my
mind
laputa
had
to
get
the
great
snake
the
necklet
of
prester
john
to
give
his
leadership
prestige
apparently
he
had
not
yet
got
it
or
arcoll
would
have
known
he
started
from
this
neighbourhood
because
the
fetich
was
somewhere
hereabouts
i
was
convinced
that
my
guess
was
right
but
i
kept
my
own
counsel
laputa
and
henriques
meet
at
umvelos
probably
at
your
new
store
mr
crawfurd
and
so
the
ball
commences
my
resolution
was
suddenly
taken
think
i
said
had
better
be
present
at
the
meeting
as
representing
the
firm
captain
arcoll
stared
at
me
and
laughed
had
thought
of
going
myself
he
said
you
go
to
certain
death
disguise
yourself
as
you
please
you
can
not
meet
them
in
the
store
as
i
can
i
there
on
my
ordinary
business
and
they
will
never
suspect
if
you
to
get
any
news
the
man
to
go
he
looked
at
me
steadily
for
a
minute
or
so
not
sure
that
such
a
bad
idea
of
yours
i
would
be
better
employed
myself
on
the
berg
and
as
you
say
i
would
have
little
chance
of
hearing
anything
you
a
plucky
fellow
mr
crawfurd
i
suppose
you
understand
that
the
risk
is
pretty
considerable
suppose
i
do
but
since
i
in
this
thing
i
may
as
well
see
it
out
besides
i
an
old
quarrel
with
our
friend
laputa
and
well
said
captain
arcoll
in
your
chair
to
the
table
then
and
i
explain
to
you
the
disposition
of
my
men
i
should
tell
you
that
i
have
loyal
natives
in
my
pay
in
most
tribes
and
can
count
on
early
intelligence
we
ca
match
their
telepathy
but
the
new
type
of
field
telegraph
is
not
so
bad
and
may
be
a
trifle
more
reliable
till
midnight
we
pored
over
maps
and
certain
details
were
burned
in
on
my
memory
then
we
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
even
mr
wardlaw
it
was
strange
how
fear
had
gone
from
the
establishment
now
that
we
knew
the
worst
and
had
a
fighting
man
by
our
side
hemp
council
lesser

chapter
viii
i
fall
in
again
with
the
reverend
john
laputa
once
as
a
boy
i
had
earnestly
desired
to
go
into
the
army
and
had
hopes
of
rising
to
be
a
great
general
now
that
i
know
myself
better
i
do
not
think
i
would
have
been
much
good
at
a
general
work
i
would
have
shirked
the
loneliness
of
it
the
isolation
of
responsibility
but
i
think
i
would
have
done
well
in
a
subaltern
command
for
i
had
a
great
notion
of
carrying
out
orders
and
a
certain
zest
in
the
mere
act
of
obedience
three
days
before
i
had
been
as
nervous
as
a
kitten
because
i
was
alone
and
it
was
to
me
as
americans
say
to
decide
on
the
next
step
but
now
that
i
was
only
one
wheel
in
a
great
machine
of
defence
my
nervousness
seemed
to
have
fled
i
was
well
aware
that
the
mission
i
was
bound
on
was
full
of
risk
but
to
my
surprise
i
felt
no
fear
indeed
i
had
much
the
same
feeling
as
a
boy
on
a
saturday
holiday
who
has
planned
a
big
expedition
one
thing
only
i
regretted
that
tam
dyke
was
not
with
me
to
see
the
fun
the
thought
of
that
faithful
soul
now
beating
somewhere
on
the
seas
made
me
long
for
his
comradeship
as
i
shaved
i
remember
wondering
if
i
would
ever
shave
again
and
the
thought
gave
me
no
tremors
for
once
in
my
sober
life
i
was
strung
up
to
the
gambler
pitch
of
adventure
my
job
was
to
go
to
umvelos
as
if
on
my
ordinary
business
and
if
possible
find
out
something
of
the
evening
plan
of
march
the
question
was
how
to
send
back
a
message
to
arcoll
assuming
i
had
any
difficulty
in
getting
away
at
first
this
puzzled
us
both
and
then
i
thought
of
colin
i
had
trained
the
dog
to
go
home
at
my
bidding
for
often
when
i
used
to
go
hunting
i
would
have
occasion
to
visit
a
kraal
where
he
would
have
been
a
nuisance
accordingly
i
resolved
to
take
colin
with
me
and
if
i
got
into
trouble
to
send
word
by
him
i
asked
about
laputa
knowledge
of
our
preparations
arcoll
was
inclined
to
think
that
he
suspected
little
the
police
and
the
commandos
had
been
kept
very
secret
and
besides
they
were
moving
on
the
high
veld
and
out
of
the
ken
of
the
tribes
natives
he
told
me
were
not
good
scouts
so
far
as
white
man
work
was
concerned
for
they
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
what
we
did
on
the
other
hand
his
own
native
scouts
brought
him
pretty
accurate
tidings
of
any
kaffir
movements
he
thought
that
all
the
bush
country
of
the
plain
would
be
closely
watched
and
that
no
one
would
get
through
without
some
kind
of
pass
but
he
thought
also
that
the
storekeeper
might
be
an
exception
for
his
presence
would
give
rise
to
no
suspicions
almost
his
last
words
to
me
were
to
come
back
if
i
saw
the
game
was
hopeless
and
in
any
case
to
leave
as
soon
as
i
got
any
news
you
there
when
the
march
begins
he
said
cut
your
throat
for
a
certainty
i
had
all
the
various
police
posts
on
the
berg
clear
in
my
mind
so
that
i
would
know
where
to
make
for
if
the
road
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
should
be
closed
i
said
to
arcoll
and
wardlaw
with
a
light
heart
though
the
schoolmaster
broke
down
and
implored
me
to
think
better
of
it
as
i
turned
down
into
the
gorge
i
heard
the
sound
of
horses
feet
far
behind
and
turning
back
saw
white
riders
dismounting
at
the
dorp
at
any
rate
i
was
leaving
the
country
well
guarded
in
my
rear
it
was
a
fine
morning
in
and
i
was
in
very
good
spirits
as
i
jogged
on
my
pony
down
the
steep
with
colin
running
beside
me
a
month
before
i
had
taken
the
same
journey
with
no
suspicion
in
my
head
of
what
the
future
was
to
bring
i
thought
about
my
dutch
companions
now
with
their
cattle
far
out
on
the
plains
did
they
know
of
the
great
danger
i
wondered
all
the
way
down
the
glen
i
saw
no
sign
of
human
presence
the
mocked
me
from
the
thicket
a
brace
of
white
circled
far
up
in
the
blue
and
i
had
for
pleasant
comrade
the
brawling
river
i
dismounted
once
to
drink
and
in
that
green
haven
of
flowers
and
ferns
i
was
struck
sharply
with
a
sense
of
folly
here
were
we
wretched
creatures
of
men
making
for
each
other
throats
and
outraging
the
good
earth
which
god
had
made
so
fair
a
habitation
i
had
resolved
on
a
short
cut
to
umvelos
avoiding
the
neighbourhood
of
sikitola
kraal
so
when
the
river
emerged
from
the
glen
i
crossed
it
and
struck
into
the
bush
i
had
not
gone
far
before
i
realized
that
something
strange
was
going
on
it
was
like
the
woods
on
the
berg
a
week
before
i
had
the
impression
of
many
people
moving
in
the
bush
and
now
and
then
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
my
first
thought
was
that
i
should
be
stopped
but
soon
it
appeared
that
these
folk
had
business
of
their
own
which
did
not
concern
me
i
was
conscious
of
being
watched
yet
it
was
clear
that
the
bush
folk
were
not
there
for
the
purpose
of
watching
me
for
a
little
i
kept
my
spirits
but
as
the
hours
passed
with
the
same
uncanny
hurrying
to
and
fro
all
about
me
my
nerves
began
to
suffer
weeks
of
espionage
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
had
made
me
jumpy
these
people
apparently
meant
me
no
ill
and
had
no
time
to
spare
on
me
but
the
sensation
of
moving
through
them
was
like
walking
on
a
night
with
precipices
all
around
i
felt
odd
quiverings
between
my
shoulder
blades
where
a
spear
might
be
expected
to
lodge
overhead
was
a
great
blue
sky
and
a
blazing
sun
and
i
could
see
the
path
running
clear
before
me
between
the
walls
of
scrub
but
it
was
like
midnight
to
me
a
midnight
of
suspicion
and
unknown
perils
i
began
to
wish
heartily
i
had
never
come
i
stopped
for
my
midday
meal
at
a
place
called
taqui
a
grassy
glade
in
the
bush
where
a
tiny
spring
of
water
crept
out
from
below
a
big
stone
only
to
disappear
in
the
sand
here
i
sat
and
smoked
for
half
an
hour
wondering
what
was
going
to
become
of
me
the
air
was
very
still
but
i
could
hear
the
rustle
of
movement
somewhere
within
a
hundred
yards
the
hidden
folk
were
busy
about
their
own
ends
and
i
regretted
that
i
had
not
taken
the
road
by
sikitola
and
seen
how
the
kraals
looked
they
must
be
empty
now
for
the
young
men
were
already
out
on
some
mission
so
nervous
i
got
that
i
took
my
and
wrote
down
certain
messages
to
my
mother
which
i
implored
whoever
should
find
my
body
to
transmit
then
a
little
ashamed
of
my
childishness
i
pulled
myself
together
and
remounted
about
three
in
the
afternoon
i
came
over
a
low
ridge
of
bush
and
saw
the
corrugated
iron
roof
of
the
store
and
the
gleam
of
water
from
the
labongo
the
sight
encouraged
me
for
at
any
rate
it
meant
the
end
of
this
disquieting
ride
here
the
bush
changed
to
trees
of
some
size
and
after
leaving
the
ridge
the
road
plunged
for
a
little
into
a
thick
shade
i
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
the
folk
in
the
bush
and
when
a
man
stepped
out
of
the
thicket
i
pulled
up
my
horse
with
a
start
it
was
a
tall
native
who
carried
himself
proudly
and
after
a
glance
at
me
stalked
along
at
my
side
he
wore
curious
clothes
for
he
had
a
kind
of
linen
tunic
and
around
his
waist
hung
a
kilt
of
in
such
a
man
one
would
have
looked
for
a
but
instead
he
had
a
mass
of
hair
not
like
a
kaffir
wool
but
long
and
curled
like
some
popular
musician
i
should
have
been
prepared
for
the
face
but
the
sight
of
it
sent
a
sudden
chill
of
fright
through
my
veins
for
there
was
the
curved
nose
the
deep
flashing
eyes
and
the
cruel
lips
of
my
enemy
of
the
kirkcaple
shore
colin
was
deeply
suspicious
and
followed
his
heels
growling
but
he
never
turned
his
head
day
is
warm
father
i
said
in
kaffir
you
go
far
he
slackened
his
pace
till
he
was
at
my
elbow
a
short
way
baas
he
replied
in
english
go
to
the
store
yonder
met
then
said
i
i
am
the
storekeeper
you
will
find
little
in
it
for
it
is
newly
built
and
not
yet
stocked
i
have
ridden
over
to
see
to
it
he
turned
his
face
to
me
is
bad
news
i
had
hoped
for
food
and
drink
yonder
i
have
travelled
far
and
in
the
chill
nights
i
desire
a
cover
for
my
head
will
the
baas
allow
me
to
sleep
the
night
in
an
outhouse
by
this
time
i
had
recovered
my
nerve
and
was
ready
to
play
the
part
i
had
determined
on
i
said
may
sleep
in
the
storeroom
if
you
care
you
will
find
sacks
for
bedding
and
the
place
is
snug
enough
on
a
cold
night
he
thanked
me
with
a
grave
dignity
which
i
had
never
seen
in
any
kaffir
as
my
eye
fell
on
his
splendid
proportions
i
forgot
all
else
in
my
admiration
of
the
man
in
his
minister
clothes
he
had
looked
only
a
heavily
built
native
but
now
in
his
savage
dress
i
saw
how
noble
a
figure
he
made
he
must
have
been
at
least
six
feet
and
a
half
but
his
chest
was
so
deep
and
his
shoulders
so
massive
that
one
did
not
remark
his
height
he
put
a
hand
on
my
saddle
and
i
remember
noting
how
slim
and
fine
it
was
more
like
a
woman
than
a
man
curiously
enough
he
filled
me
with
a
certain
confidence
do
not
think
you
will
cut
my
throat
i
said
to
myself
game
is
too
big
for
common
murder
the
store
at
umvelos
stood
as
i
had
left
it
there
was
the
sjambok
i
had
forgotten
still
lying
on
the
window
sill
i
unlocked
the
door
and
a
stifling
smell
of
new
paint
came
out
to
meet
me
inside
there
was
nothing
but
the
chairs
and
benches
and
in
a
corner
the
pots
and
pans
i
had
left
against
my
next
visit
i
unlocked
the
cupboard
and
got
out
a
few
stores
opened
the
windows
of
the
bedroom
next
door
and
flung
my
kaross
on
the
cartel
which
did
duty
as
bed
then
i
went
out
to
find
laputa
standing
patiently
in
the
sunshine
i
showed
him
the
outhouse
where
i
had
said
he
might
sleep
it
was
the
largest
room
in
the
store
but
wholly
unfurnished
a
pile
of
barrels
and
stood
in
the
corner
and
there
was
enough
sacking
to
make
a
sort
of
bed
am
going
to
make
tea
i
said
you
have
come
far
you
would
maybe
like
a
cup
he
thanked
me
and
i
made
a
fire
in
the
grate
and
put
on
the
kettle
to
boil
then
i
set
on
the
table
biscuits
and
sardines
and
a
pot
of
jam
it
was
my
business
now
to
play
the
fool
and
i
believe
i
succeeded
to
admiration
in
the
part
i
blush
to
think
of
the
stuff
i
talked
first
i
made
him
sit
on
a
chair
opposite
me
a
thing
no
white
man
in
the
country
would
have
done
then
i
told
him
affectionately
that
i
liked
natives
that
they
were
fine
fellows
and
better
men
than
the
dirty
whites
round
about
i
explained
that
i
was
fresh
from
england
and
believed
in
equal
rights
for
all
men
white
or
coloured
god
forgive
me
but
i
think
i
said
i
hoped
to
see
the
day
when
africa
would
belong
once
more
to
its
rightful
masters
he
heard
me
with
an
impassive
face
his
grave
eyes
studying
every
line
of
me
i
am
bound
to
add
that
he
made
a
hearty
meal
and
drank
three
cups
of
strong
tea
of
my
brewing
i
gave
him
a
cigar
one
of
a
lot
i
had
got
from
a
dutch
farmer
who
was
experimenting
with
their
manufacture
and
all
the
while
i
babbled
of
myself
and
my
opinions
he
must
have
thought
me
and
indeed
before
long
i
began
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
myself
i
told
him
that
i
meant
to
sleep
the
night
here
and
go
back
in
the
morning
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
and
then
to
pietersdorp
for
stores
i
could
see
that
he
had
ceased
to
pay
any
attention
to
what
i
said
i
was
clearly
set
down
in
his
mind
as
a
fool
instead
he
kept
looking
at
colin
who
was
lying
blinking
in
the
doorway
one
wary
eye
cocked
on
the
stranger
have
a
fine
dog
he
observed
i
agreed
with
one
final
effort
of
mendacity
fine
to
look
at
but
he
has
no
grit
in
him
any
mongrel
from
a
kraal
can
make
him
turn
tail
besides
he
is
a
born
fool
and
ca
find
his
way
home
i
thinking
of
getting
rid
of
him
laputa
rose
and
his
eye
fell
on
the
dog
back
i
could
see
that
he
saw
the
lie
of
his
coat
and
that
he
did
not
agree
with
me
food
was
welcome
baas
he
said
you
will
listen
to
me
i
can
repay
hospitality
with
advice
you
are
a
stranger
here
trouble
comes
and
if
you
are
wise
you
will
go
back
to
the
berg
do
know
what
you
mean
i
said
with
an
air
of
cheerful
idiocy
back
to
the
berg
i
go
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
hate
these
stinking
plains
were
wise
to
go
he
said
with
a
touch
of
menace
in
his
tone
ca
i
said
and
began
to
sing
the
chorus
of
a
ridiculous
song
no
place
like
home
but
i
afraid
to
go
home
in
the
dark
laputa
shrugged
his
shoulders
stepped
over
the
bristling
colin
and
went
out
when
i
looked
after
him
two
minutes
later
he
had
disappeared
the
circlet
into
which
with
the
aid
of
gum
zulu
warriors
weave
their
hair
chapter
ix
the
store
at
i
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
laboured
to
collect
my
thoughts
laputa
had
gone
and
would
return
sooner
or
later
with
henriques
if
i
was
to
remain
alive
till
morning
both
of
them
must
be
convinced
that
i
was
harmless
laputa
was
probably
of
that
opinion
but
henriques
would
recognize
me
and
i
had
no
wish
to
have
that
yellow
miscreant
investigating
my
character
there
was
only
one
way
out
of
it
i
must
be
incapably
drunk
there
was
not
a
drop
of
liquor
in
the
store
but
i
found
an
old
whisky
bottle
half
full
of
methylated
spirits
with
this
i
thought
i
might
raise
an
atmosphere
of
bad
whisky
and
for
the
rest
i
must
trust
to
my
meagre
gifts
as
an
actor
supposing
i
escaped
suspicion
laputa
and
henriques
would
meet
in
the
outhouse
and
i
must
find
some
means
of
overhearing
them
here
i
was
fairly
baffled
there
was
no
window
in
the
outhouse
save
in
the
roof
and
they
were
sure
to
shut
and
bolt
the
door
i
might
conceal
myself
among
the
barrels
inside
but
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
were
likely
to
search
them
before
beginning
their
conference
it
was
quite
certain
that
they
would
satisfy
themselves
that
i
was
safe
in
the
other
end
of
the
building
before
going
to
the
outhouse
suddenly
i
thought
of
the
cellar
which
we
had
built
below
the
store
there
was
an
entrance
by
a
behind
the
counter
and
another
in
the
outhouse
i
had
forgotten
the
details
but
my
hope
was
that
the
second
was
among
the
barrels
i
shut
the
outer
door
prised
up
the
trap
and
dropped
into
the
vault
which
had
been
floored
roughly
with
green
bricks
lighting
match
after
match
i
crawled
to
the
other
end
and
tried
to
lift
the
door
it
would
not
stir
so
i
guessed
that
the
barrels
were
on
the
top
of
it
back
to
the
outhouse
i
went
and
found
that
sure
enough
a
heavy
was
standing
on
a
corner
i
fixed
it
slightly
open
so
as
to
let
me
hear
and
so
arranged
the
odds
and
ends
round
about
it
that
no
one
looking
from
the
floor
of
the
outhouse
would
guess
at
its
existence
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
conspirators
would
want
seats
so
i
placed
two
cases
at
the
edge
of
the
heap
that
they
might
not
be
tempted
to
forage
in
the
interior
this
done
i
went
back
to
the
store
and
proceeded
to
rig
myself
out
for
my
part
the
cellar
had
made
me
pretty
dirty
and
i
added
some
new
daubs
to
my
face
my
hair
had
grown
longish
and
i
ran
my
hands
through
it
till
it
stood
up
like
a
cockatoo
crest
then
i
cunningly
disposed
the
methylated
spirits
in
the
places
most
likely
to
smell
i
burned
a
little
on
the
floor
i
spilt
some
on
the
counter
and
on
my
hands
and
i
let
it
dribble
over
my
coat
in
five
minutes
i
had
made
the
room
stink
like
a
shebeen
i
loosened
the
collar
of
my
shirt
and
when
i
looked
at
myself
in
the
cover
of
my
watch
i
saw
a
specimen
of
debauchery
which
would
have
done
credit
to
a
saturday
night
police
cell
by
this
time
the
sun
had
gone
down
but
i
thought
it
better
to
kindle
no
light
it
was
the
night
of
the
full
moon
for
which
reason
i
supposed
laputa
had
selected
it
and
in
an
hour
or
two
the
world
would
be
lit
with
that
ghostly
radiance
i
sat
on
the
counter
while
the
minutes
passed
and
i
confess
i
found
the
time
of
waiting
very
trying
for
my
courage
i
had
got
over
my
worst
nervousness
by
having
something
to
do
but
whenever
i
was
idle
my
fears
returned
laputa
had
a
big
night
work
before
him
and
must
begin
soon
my
vigil
i
told
myself
could
not
be
long
my
pony
was
stalled
in
a
rough
shed
we
had
built
opposite
the
store
i
could
hear
him
shaking
his
head
and
stamping
the
ground
above
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
by
the
labongo
presently
it
seemed
to
me
that
another
sound
came
from
behind
the
store
the
sound
of
horses
feet
and
the
rattle
of
bridles
it
was
hushed
for
a
moment
and
then
i
heard
human
voices
the
riders
had
tied
up
their
horses
to
a
tree
and
were
coming
nearer
i
sprawled
gracefully
on
the
counter
the
empty
bottle
in
my
hand
and
my
eyes
fixed
anxiously
on
the
square
of
the
door
which
was
filled
with
the
blue
glimmer
of
the
late
twilight
the
square
darkened
and
two
men
peered
in
colin
growled
from
below
the
counter
but
with
one
hand
i
held
the
scruff
of
his
neck
i
said
that
my
black
friend
awfly
shorry
old
man
but
i
th
whisky
the
shempty
and
i
waved
it
upside
down
with
an
imbecile
giggle
laputa
said
something
which
i
did
not
catch
henriques
laughed
an
ugly
laugh
had
better
make
certain
of
him
he
said
the
two
argued
for
a
minute
and
then
laputa
seemed
to
prevail
the
door
was
shut
and
the
key
which
i
had
left
in
the
lock
turned
on
me
i
gave
them
five
minutes
to
get
to
the
outhouse
and
settle
to
business
then
i
opened
the
trap
got
into
the
cellar
and
crawled
to
the
other
end
a
ray
of
light
was
coming
through
the
partially
raised
door
by
a
blessed
chance
some
old
bricks
had
been
left
behind
and
of
these
i
made
a
footstool
which
enabled
me
to
get
my
back
level
with
the
door
and
look
out
my
laager
of
barrels
was
intact
but
through
a
gap
i
had
left
i
could
see
the
two
men
sitting
on
the
two
cases
i
had
provided
for
them
a
lantern
was
set
between
them
and
henriques
was
drinking
out
of
a
metal
flask
he
took
something
i
could
not
see
what
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
it
before
his
companion
of
war
he
said
let
sikitola
men
draw
first
blood
they
needed
it
to
screw
up
their
courage
now
they
are
as
wild
as
umbooni
laputa
asked
a
question
was
the
dutchmen
who
were
out
on
the
koodoo
flats
with
their
cattle
man
it
no
good
being
squeamish
do
you
think
you
can
talk
over
these
surly
fools
if
we
had
not
done
it
the
best
of
their
horses
would
now
be
over
the
berg
to
give
warning
besides
i
tell
you
sikitola
men
wanted
blooding
i
did
for
the
old
swine
coetzee
with
my
own
hands
once
he
set
his
dogs
on
me
and
i
forget
an
injury
laputa
must
have
disapproved
for
henriques
voice
grew
high
the
show
the
way
you
please
he
cried
do
blame
me
if
you
make
a
hash
of
it
god
man
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
work
a
revolution
on
skim
milk
if
i
had
my
will
i
would
go
in
and
stick
a
knife
in
the
drunken
hog
next
door
is
safe
enough
laputa
replied
gave
him
the
chance
of
life
and
he
laughed
at
me
he
wo
get
far
on
his
road
home
this
was
pleasant
hearing
for
me
but
i
scarcely
thought
of
myself
i
was
consumed
with
a
passion
of
fury
against
the
murdering
yellow
devil
with
laputa
i
was
not
angry
he
was
an
open
enemy
playing
a
fair
game
but
my
fingers
itched
to
get
at
the
portugoose
that
traitor
to
his
race
as
i
thought
of
my
kindly
old
friends
lying
butchered
with
their
kinsfolk
out
in
the
bush
hot
tears
of
rage
came
to
my
eyes
perfect
love
casteth
out
fear
the
bible
says
but
to
speak
it
reverently
so
does
perfect
hate
not
for
safety
and
a
ransom
would
i
have
drawn
back
from
the
game
i
prayed
for
one
thing
only
that
god
in
his
mercy
would
give
me
the
chance
of
settling
with
henriques
i
fancy
i
missed
some
of
the
conversation
being
occupied
with
my
own
passion
at
any
rate
when
i
next
listened
the
two
were
deep
in
plans
maps
were
spread
beside
them
and
laputa
delicate
forefinger
was
tracing
a
route
i
strained
my
ears
but
could
catch
only
a
few
names
apparently
they
were
to
keep
in
the
plains
till
they
had
crossed
the
klein
labongo
and
the
letaba
i
thought
i
caught
the
name
of
the
ford
of
the
latter
it
sounded
like
dupree
drift
after
that
the
talk
became
plainer
for
laputa
was
explaining
in
his
clear
voice
the
force
would
leave
the
bush
ascend
the
berg
by
the
glen
of
the
groot
letaba
and
the
first
halt
would
be
called
at
a
place
called
inanda
kraal
where
a
promontory
of
the
juts
out
behind
the
peaks
called
the
wolkberg
or
cloud
mountains
all
this
was
very
much
to
the
point
and
the
names
sunk
into
my
memory
like
a
die
into
wax
said
laputa
is
the
gathering
at
ntabakaikonjwa
it
will
take
us
three
hours
hard
riding
to
get
there
where
on
earth
was
ntabakaikonjwa
it
must
be
the
native
name
for
the
rooirand
for
after
all
laputa
was
not
likely
to
use
the
dutch
word
for
his
own
sacred
place
has
been
forgotten
the
men
are
massed
below
the
cliffs
and
the
chiefs
and
the
great
indunas
will
enter
the
place
of
the
snake
the
door
will
be
guarded
and
only
the
password
will
get
a
man
through
that
word
is
immanuel
which
means
god
with
us
when
we
get
there
what
happens
henriques
asked
with
a
laugh
kind
of
magic
will
you
spring
on
us
there
was
a
strong
contrast
between
the
flippant
tone
of
the
portugoose
and
the
grave
voice
which
answered
him
keeper
of
the
snake
will
open
the
holy
place
and
bring
forth
the
isetembiso
sami
as
the
leader
of
my
people
i
will
assume
the
collar
of
umkulunkulu
in
the
name
of
our
god
and
the
spirits
of
the
great
dead
you
do
propose
to
lead
the
march
in
a
necklace
of
rubies
said
henriques
with
a
sudden
eagerness
in
his
voice
again
laputa
spoke
gravely
and
as
it
were
abstractedly
i
heard
the
voice
of
one
whose
mind
was
fixed
on
a
far
horizon
i
am
acclaimed
king
i
restore
the
snake
to
its
keeper
and
swear
never
to
clasp
it
on
my
neck
till
i
have
led
my
people
to
victory
see
said
henriques
about
the
purification
you
mentioned
i
had
missed
this
before
and
listened
earnestly
vows
we
take
in
the
holy
place
bind
us
till
we
are
purged
of
them
at
inanda
kraal
till
then
no
blood
must
be
shed
and
no
flesh
eaten
it
was
the
fashion
of
our
forefathers
i
think
you
taken
on
a
pretty
risky
job
henriques
said
propose
to
travel
a
hundred
miles
binding
yourself
not
to
strike
a
blow
it
is
simply
putting
yourself
at
the
mercy
of
any
police
patrol
will
be
no
patrol
laputa
replied
march
will
be
as
secret
and
as
swift
as
death
i
have
made
my
preparations
suppose
you
met
with
opposition
the
portugoose
persisted
the
rule
hold
any
try
to
stop
us
we
shall
tie
them
hand
and
foot
and
carry
them
with
us
their
fate
will
be
worse
than
if
they
had
been
slain
in
battle
see
said
henriques
whistling
through
his
teeth
before
we
start
this
vow
business
i
think
i
go
back
and
settle
that
storekeeper
laputa
shook
his
head
you
be
serious
and
hear
me
we
have
no
time
to
knife
harmless
fools
before
we
start
for
ntabakaikonjwa
i
must
have
from
you
the
figures
of
the
arming
in
the
south
that
is
the
one
thing
which
remains
to
be
settled
i
am
certain
these
figures
would
have
been
most
interesting
but
i
never
heard
them
my
feet
were
getting
cramped
with
standing
on
the
bricks
and
i
inadvertently
moved
them
the
bricks
came
down
with
a
rattle
and
unfortunately
in
slipping
i
clutched
at
the
trap
this
was
too
much
for
my
frail
prop
and
the
door
slammed
down
with
a
great
noise
here
was
a
nice
business
for
the
eavesdropper
i
scurried
along
the
passage
as
stealthily
as
i
could
and
clambered
back
into
the
store
while
i
heard
the
sound
of
laputa
and
henriques
ferreting
among
the
barrels
i
managed
to
throttle
colin
and
prevent
him
barking
but
i
could
not
get
the
confounded
trap
to
close
behind
me
something
had
jammed
in
it
and
it
remained
half
a
foot
open
i
heard
the
two
approaching
the
door
and
i
did
the
best
thing
that
occurred
to
me
i
pulled
colin
over
the
trap
rolled
on
the
top
of
him
and
began
to
snore
heavily
as
if
in
a
drunken
slumber
the
key
was
turned
and
the
gleam
of
a
lantern
was
thrown
on
the
wall
it
flew
up
and
down
as
its
bearer
cast
the
light
into
the
corners
god
he
gone
i
heard
henriques
say
swine
was
listening
and
he
has
bolted
now
wo
bolt
far
laputa
said
is
here
he
is
snoring
behind
the
counter
these
were
anxious
moments
for
me
i
had
a
firm
grip
on
throat
but
now
and
then
a
growl
escaped
which
was
fortunately
blended
with
my
snores
i
felt
that
a
lantern
was
flashed
on
me
and
that
the
two
men
were
peering
down
at
the
heap
on
the
trap
i
think
that
was
the
worst
minute
i
ever
spent
for
as
i
have
said
my
courage
was
not
so
bad
in
action
but
in
a
passive
game
it
oozed
out
of
my
fingers
is
safe
enough
laputa
said
after
what
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
noise
was
only
the
rats
among
the
barrels
i
thanked
my
maker
that
they
had
not
noticed
the
other
the
same
i
think
i
make
him
safer
said
henriques
laputa
seemed
to
have
caught
him
by
the
arm
back
and
get
to
business
he
said
told
you
i
have
no
more
murder
you
will
do
as
i
tell
you
mr
henriques
i
did
not
catch
the
answer
but
the
two
went
out
and
locked
the
door
i
patted
the
outraged
colin
and
got
to
my
feet
with
an
aching
side
where
the
confounded
lid
of
the
trap
had
been
pressing
there
was
no
time
to
lose
for
the
two
in
the
outhouse
would
soon
be
setting
out
and
i
must
be
before
them
with
no
better
light
than
a
ray
of
the
moon
through
the
window
i
wrote
a
message
on
a
leaf
from
my
i
told
of
the
plans
i
had
overheard
and
especially
i
mentioned
dupree
drift
on
the
letaba
i
added
that
i
was
going
to
the
rooirand
to
find
the
secret
of
the
cave
and
in
one
final
sentence
implored
arcoll
to
do
justice
on
the
portugoose
that
was
all
for
i
had
no
time
for
more
i
carefully
tied
the
paper
with
a
string
below
the
collar
of
the
dog
then
very
quietly
i
went
into
the
bedroom
next
door
the
side
of
the
store
farthest
from
the
outhouse
the
place
was
flooded
with
moonlight
and
the
window
stood
open
as
i
had
left
it
in
the
afternoon
as
softly
as
i
could
i
swung
colin
over
the
sill
and
clambered
after
him
in
my
haste
i
left
my
coat
behind
me
with
my
pistol
in
the
pocket
now
came
a
check
my
horse
was
stabled
in
the
shed
and
that
was
close
to
the
outhouse
the
sound
of
leading
him
out
would
most
certainly
bring
laputa
and
henriques
to
the
door
in
that
moment
i
all
but
changed
my
plans
i
thought
of
slipping
back
to
the
outhouse
and
trying
to
shoot
the
two
men
as
they
came
forth
but
i
reflected
that
before
i
could
get
them
both
one
or
other
would
probably
shoot
me
besides
i
had
a
queer
sort
of
compunction
about
killing
laputa
i
understood
now
why
arcoll
had
stayed
his
hand
from
murder
and
i
was
beginning
to
be
of
his
opinion
on
our
then
i
remembered
the
horses
tied
up
in
the
bush
one
of
them
i
could
get
with
perfect
safety
i
ran
round
the
end
of
the
store
and
into
the
thicket
keeping
on
soft
grass
to
dull
my
tread
there
tied
up
to
a
merula
tree
were
two
of
the
finest
beasts
i
had
seen
in
africa
i
selected
the
better
an
africander
stallion
of
the
or
type
which
is
famous
for
speed
and
endurance
slipping
his
bridle
from
the
branch
i
led
him
a
little
way
into
the
bush
in
the
direction
of
the
rooirand
then
i
spoke
to
colin
with
you
i
said
old
man
as
if
you
were
running
down
a
tsessebe
the
dog
seemed
puzzled
i
said
again
pointing
west
in
the
direction
of
the
berg
you
brute
and
then
he
understood
he
gave
one
low
whine
and
cast
a
reproachful
eye
on
me
and
the
blue
roan
then
he
turned
and
with
his
head
down
set
off
with
great
lopes
on
the
track
of
the
road
i
had
ridden
in
the
morning
a
second
later
and
i
was
in
the
saddle
riding
for
the
north
literally
hill
which
is
not
to
be
pointed
at
literally
sacred
thing
a
species
of
buck
famous
for
its
speed
chapter
x
i
go
for
a
mile
or
so
i
kept
the
bush
which
was
open
and
easy
to
ride
through
and
then
turned
into
the
path
the
moon
was
high
and
the
world
was
all
a
dim
dark
green
with
the
track
a
golden
ivory
band
before
me
i
had
looked
at
my
watch
before
i
started
and
seen
that
it
was
just
after
eight
i
had
a
great
horse
under
me
and
less
than
thirty
miles
to
cover
midnight
should
see
me
at
the
cave
with
the
password
i
would
gain
admittance
and
there
would
wait
for
laputa
and
henriques
then
if
my
luck
held
i
should
see
the
inner
workings
of
the
mystery
which
had
puzzled
me
ever
since
the
kirkcaple
shore
no
doubt
i
should
be
roughly
treated
tied
up
prisoner
and
carried
with
the
army
when
the
march
began
but
till
inanda
kraal
my
life
was
safe
and
before
that
came
the
ford
of
the
letaba
colin
would
carry
my
message
to
arcoll
and
at
the
drift
the
tables
would
be
turned
on
laputa
men
looking
back
in
cold
blood
it
seems
the
craziest
chain
of
accidents
to
count
on
for
preservation
a
dozen
possibilities
might
have
shattered
any
link
of
it
the
password
might
be
wrong
or
i
might
never
get
the
length
of
those
who
knew
it
the
men
in
the
cave
might
butcher
me
out
of
hand
or
laputa
might
think
my
behaviour
a
sufficient
warrant
for
the
breach
of
the
solemnest
vow
colin
might
never
get
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
laputa
might
change
his
route
of
march
or
arcoll
men
might
fail
to
hold
the
drift
indeed
the
other
day
at
portincross
i
was
so
overcome
by
the
recollection
of
the
perils
i
had
dared
and
god
goodness
towards
me
that
i
built
a
new
hall
for
the
parish
kirk
as
a
token
of
gratitude
fortunately
for
mankind
the
brain
in
a
life
of
action
turns
more
to
the
matter
in
hand
than
to
conjuring
up
the
chances
of
the
future
certainly
it
was
in
no
discomfort
of
mind
that
i
swung
along
the
moonlit
path
to
the
north
truth
to
tell
i
was
almost
happy
the
first
honours
in
the
game
had
fallen
to
me
i
knew
more
about
laputa
than
any
man
living
save
henriques
i
had
my
finger
on
the
central
pulse
of
the
rebellion
there
was
hid
treasure
ahead
of
me
a
great
necklace
of
rubies
henriques
had
said
nay
there
must
be
more
i
argued
this
cave
of
the
rooirand
was
the
headquarters
of
the
rising
and
there
must
be
stored
their
funds
diamonds
and
the
gold
they
had
been
bartered
for
i
believe
that
every
man
has
deep
in
his
soul
a
passion
for
which
will
often
drive
a
coward
into
prodigies
of
valour
i
lusted
for
that
treasure
of
jewels
and
gold
once
i
had
been
and
thought
of
my
duty
to
my
country
but
in
that
night
ride
i
fear
that
what
i
thought
of
was
my
duty
to
enrich
david
crawfurd
one
other
purpose
simmered
in
my
head
i
was
devoured
with
wrath
against
henriques
indeed
i
think
that
was
the
strongest
motive
for
my
escapade
for
even
before
i
heard
laputa
tell
of
the
vows
and
the
purification
i
had
it
in
my
mind
to
go
at
all
costs
to
the
cave
i
am
a
peaceable
man
at
most
times
but
i
think
i
would
rather
have
had
the
portugoose
throat
in
my
hands
than
the
collar
of
prester
john
but
behind
my
thoughts
was
one
that
providence
had
given
me
my
chance
and
i
must
make
the
most
of
it
perhaps
the
calvinism
of
my
father
preaching
had
unconsciously
taken
grip
of
my
soul
at
any
rate
i
was
a
fatalist
in
creed
believing
that
what
was
willed
would
happen
and
that
man
was
but
a
puppet
in
the
hands
of
his
maker
i
looked
on
the
last
months
as
a
clear
course
which
had
been
mapped
out
for
me
not
for
nothing
had
i
been
given
a
clue
to
the
strange
events
which
were
coming
it
was
foreordained
that
i
should
go
alone
to
umvelos
and
in
the
promptings
of
my
own
fallible
heart
i
believed
i
saw
the
workings
of
omnipotence
such
is
our
moral
arrogance
and
yet
without
such
a
belief
i
think
that
mankind
would
have
ever
been
content
to
bide
sluggishly
at
home
i
passed
the
spot
where
on
my
former
journey
i
had
met
the
horses
and
knew
that
i
had
covered
more
than
half
the
road
my
ear
had
been
alert
for
the
sound
of
pursuit
but
the
bush
was
quiet
as
the
grave
the
man
who
rode
my
pony
would
find
him
a
slow
traveller
and
i
pitied
the
poor
beast
bucketed
along
by
an
angry
rider
gradually
a
hazy
wall
of
purple
began
to
shimmer
before
me
apparently
very
far
off
i
knew
the
ramparts
of
the
rooirand
and
let
my
feel
my
knees
in
his
ribs
within
an
hour
i
should
be
at
the
cliff
foot
i
had
trusted
for
safety
to
the
password
but
as
it
turned
out
i
owed
my
life
mainly
to
my
horse
for
a
mile
or
so
from
the
cliffs
i
came
to
the
fringes
of
a
great
army
the
bush
was
teeming
with
men
and
i
saw
horses
picketed
in
bunches
and
a
multitude
of
and
light
wagons
it
was
like
a
colossal
gathering
for
at
a
dutch
dorp
but
every
man
was
black
i
saw
through
a
corner
of
my
eye
that
they
were
armed
with
guns
though
many
carried
in
addition
their
spears
and
shields
their
first
impulse
was
to
stop
me
i
saw
guns
fly
to
shoulders
and
a
rush
towards
the
path
the
boldest
game
was
the
safest
so
i
dug
my
heels
into
the
and
shouted
for
a
passage
way
i
cried
in
kaffir
bear
a
message
from
the
inkulu
clear
out
you
dogs
they
recognized
the
horse
and
fell
back
with
a
salute
had
i
but
known
it
the
beast
was
famed
from
the
zambesi
to
the
cape
it
was
their
king
own
charger
i
rode
and
who
dared
question
such
a
warrant
i
heard
the
word
pass
through
the
bush
and
all
down
the
road
i
got
the
salute
in
that
moment
i
fervently
thanked
my
stars
that
i
had
got
away
first
for
there
would
have
been
no
coming
second
for
me
at
the
i
found
a
double
line
of
warriors
who
had
the
appearance
of
a
royal
guard
for
all
were
tall
men
with
cloaks
their
glinted
in
the
and
the
sight
sent
a
cold
shiver
down
my
back
above
them
among
the
scrub
and
along
the
lower
slopes
of
the
kranzes
i
could
see
further
lines
with
the
same
gleaming
weapons
the
place
of
the
snake
was
in
strong
hands
that
night
i
dismounted
and
called
for
a
man
to
take
my
horse
two
of
the
guards
stepped
forward
in
silence
and
took
the
bridle
this
left
the
track
to
the
cave
open
and
with
as
stiff
a
back
as
i
could
command
but
a
sadly
fluttering
heart
i
marched
through
the
ranks
the
path
was
lined
with
guards
all
silent
and
rigid
as
graven
images
as
i
stumbled
over
the
stones
i
felt
that
my
appearance
scarcely
fitted
the
dignity
of
a
royal
messenger
among
those
splendid
i
shambled
along
in
old
breeches
and
leggings
hatless
with
a
dirty
face
dishevelled
hair
and
a
torn
flannel
shirt
my
mind
was
no
better
than
my
body
for
now
that
i
had
arrived
i
found
my
courage
gone
had
it
been
possible
i
would
have
turned
tail
and
fled
but
the
boats
were
burned
behind
me
and
i
had
no
choice
i
cursed
my
rash
folly
and
wondered
at
my
exhilaration
of
an
hour
ago
i
was
going
into
the
black
mysterious
darkness
peopled
by
ten
thousand
cruel
foes
my
knees
rubbed
against
each
other
and
i
thought
that
no
man
had
ever
been
in
more
deadly
danger
at
the
entrance
to
the
gorge
the
guards
ceased
and
i
went
on
alone
here
there
was
no
moonlight
and
i
had
to
feel
my
way
by
the
sides
i
moved
very
slowly
wondering
how
soon
i
should
find
the
end
my
folly
demanded
the
heat
of
the
ride
had
gone
and
i
remember
feeling
my
shirt
hang
clammily
on
my
shoulders
suddenly
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
breast
and
a
voice
demanded
word
i
said
hoarsely
then
unseen
hands
took
both
my
arms
and
i
was
led
farther
into
the
darkness
my
hopes
revived
for
a
second
the
password
had
proved
true
and
at
any
rate
i
should
enter
the
cave
in
the
darkness
i
could
see
nothing
but
i
judged
that
we
stopped
before
the
stone
slab
which
as
i
remembered
filled
the
extreme
end
of
the
gorge
my
guide
did
something
with
the
wall
and
i
felt
myself
being
drawn
into
a
kind
of
passage
it
was
so
narrow
that
two
could
not
go
abreast
and
so
low
that
the
creepers
above
scraped
my
hair
something
clicked
behind
me
like
the
turnstile
at
the
gate
of
a
show
then
we
began
to
ascend
steps
still
in
utter
darkness
and
a
great
booming
fell
on
my
ear
it
was
the
falling
river
which
had
scared
me
on
my
former
visit
and
i
marvelled
that
i
had
not
heard
it
sooner
presently
we
came
out
into
a
gleam
of
moonlight
and
i
saw
that
we
were
inside
the
gorge
and
far
above
the
slab
we
followed
a
narrow
shelf
on
its
left
side
or
right
as
mountaineers
would
call
it
until
we
could
go
no
farther
then
we
did
a
terrible
thing
across
the
gorge
which
here
was
at
its
narrowest
stretched
a
slab
of
stone
far
far
below
i
caught
the
moonlight
on
a
mass
of
hurrying
waters
this
was
our
bridge
and
though
i
have
a
good
head
for
crags
i
confess
i
grew
dizzy
as
we
turned
to
cross
it
perhaps
it
was
broader
than
it
looked
at
any
rate
my
guides
seemed
to
have
no
fear
and
strode
across
it
as
if
it
was
a
highway
while
i
followed
in
a
sweat
of
fright
once
on
the
other
side
i
was
handed
over
to
a
second
pair
of
guides
who
led
me
down
a
high
passage
running
into
the
heart
of
the
mountain
the
boom
of
the
river
sank
and
rose
as
the
passage
twined
soon
i
saw
a
gleam
of
light
ahead
which
was
not
the
moon
it
grew
larger
until
suddenly
the
roof
rose
and
i
found
myself
in
a
gigantic
chamber
so
high
it
was
that
i
could
not
make
out
anything
of
the
roof
though
the
place
was
brightly
lit
with
torches
stuck
round
the
wall
and
a
great
fire
which
burned
at
the
farther
end
but
the
wonder
was
on
the
left
side
where
the
floor
ceased
in
a
chasm
the
left
wall
was
one
sheet
of
water
where
the
river
fell
from
the
heights
into
the
infinite
depth
below
the
torches
and
the
fire
made
the
sheer
stream
glow
and
sparkle
like
the
battlements
of
the
heavenly
city
i
have
never
seen
any
sight
so
beautiful
or
so
strange
and
for
a
second
my
breath
stopped
in
admiration
there
were
two
hundred
men
or
more
in
the
chamber
but
so
huge
was
the
place
that
they
seemed
only
a
little
company
they
sat
on
the
ground
in
a
circle
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
and
on
a
figure
which
stood
before
it
the
glow
revealed
the
old
man
i
had
seen
on
that
morning
a
month
before
moving
towards
the
cave
he
stood
as
if
in
a
trance
straight
as
a
tree
with
his
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
a
robe
of
some
shining
white
stuff
fell
from
his
shoulders
and
was
clasped
round
his
middle
by
a
broad
circle
of
gold
his
head
was
shaven
and
on
his
forehead
was
bound
a
disc
of
carved
gold
i
saw
from
his
gaze
that
his
old
eyes
were
blind
comes
he
asked
as
i
entered
messenger
from
the
inkulu
i
spoke
up
boldly
follows
soon
with
the
white
man
henriques
then
i
sat
down
in
the
back
row
of
the
circle
to
await
events
i
noticed
that
my
neighbour
was
the
fellow
whom
i
had
kicked
out
of
the
store
happily
i
was
so
dusty
that
he
could
scarcely
recognize
me
but
i
kept
my
face
turned
away
from
him
what
with
the
light
and
the
warmth
the
drone
of
the
water
the
silence
of
the
folk
and
my
mental
and
physical
stress
i
grew
drowsy
and
all
but
slept
the
communion
sabbath
a
title
applied
only
to
the
greatest
chiefs
chapter
xi
the
cave
of
the
rooirand
i
was
roused
by
a
sudden
movement
the
whole
assembly
stood
up
and
each
man
clapped
his
right
hand
to
his
brow
and
then
raised
it
high
a
low
murmur
of
rose
above
the
din
of
the
water
laputa
strode
down
the
hall
with
henriques
limping
behind
him
they
certainly
did
not
suspect
my
presence
in
the
cave
nor
did
laputa
show
any
ruffling
of
his
calm
only
henriques
looked
weary
and
cross
i
guessed
he
had
had
to
ride
my
pony
the
old
man
whom
i
took
to
be
the
priest
advanced
towards
laputa
with
his
hands
raised
over
his
head
a
pace
before
they
met
he
halted
and
laputa
went
on
his
knees
before
him
he
placed
his
hands
on
his
head
and
spoke
some
words
which
i
could
not
understand
it
reminded
me
so
queer
are
the
tricks
of
memory
of
an
old
book
i
used
to
have
which
had
a
picture
of
samuel
ordaining
saul
as
king
of
israel
i
think
i
had
forgotten
my
own
peril
and
was
enthralled
by
the
majesty
of
the
place
the
wavering
torches
the
dropping
wall
of
green
water
above
all
the
figures
of
laputa
and
the
keeper
of
the
snake
who
seemed
to
have
stepped
out
of
an
antique
world
laputa
stripped
off
his
leopard
skin
till
he
stood
stark
a
noble
form
of
a
man
then
the
priest
sprinkled
some
herbs
on
the
fire
and
a
thin
smoke
rose
to
the
roof
the
smell
was
that
i
had
smelled
on
the
kirkcaple
shore
sweet
sharp
and
strange
enough
to
chill
the
marrow
and
round
the
fire
went
the
priest
in
widening
and
contracting
circles
just
as
on
that
sabbath
evening
in
spring
once
more
we
were
sitting
on
the
ground
all
except
laputa
and
the
keeper
henriques
was
squatting
in
the
front
row
a
tiny
creature
among
so
many
burly
savages
laputa
stood
with
bent
head
in
the
centre
then
a
song
began
a
wild
incantation
in
which
all
joined
the
old
priest
would
speak
some
words
and
the
reply
came
in
barbaric
music
the
words
meant
nothing
to
me
they
must
have
been
in
some
tongue
long
since
dead
but
the
music
told
its
own
tale
it
spoke
of
old
kings
and
great
battles
of
splendid
palaces
and
strong
battlements
of
queens
white
as
ivory
of
death
and
life
love
and
hate
joy
and
sorrow
it
spoke
too
of
desperate
things
mysteries
of
horror
long
shut
to
the
world
no
kaffir
ever
forged
that
ritual
it
must
have
come
straight
from
prester
john
or
sheba
queen
or
whoever
ruled
in
africa
when
time
was
young
i
was
horribly
impressed
devouring
curiosity
and
a
lurking
nameless
fear
filled
my
mind
my
old
dread
had
gone
i
was
not
afraid
now
of
kaffir
guns
but
of
the
black
magic
of
which
laputa
had
the
key
the
incantation
died
away
but
still
herbs
were
flung
on
the
fire
till
the
smoke
rose
in
a
great
cloud
through
which
the
priest
loomed
misty
and
huge
out
of
the
his
voice
came
high
and
strange
it
was
as
if
some
treble
stop
had
been
opened
in
a
great
organ
as
against
the
bass
drone
of
the
cataract
he
was
asking
laputa
questions
to
which
came
answers
in
that
rich
voice
which
on
board
the
liner
had
preached
the
gospel
of
christ
the
tongue
i
did
not
know
and
i
doubt
if
my
neighbours
were
in
better
case
it
must
have
been
some
old
sacred
language
phoenician
sabaean
i
know
not
what
which
had
survived
in
the
rite
of
the
snake
then
came
silence
while
the
fire
died
down
and
the
smoke
eddied
away
in
wreaths
towards
the
river
the
priest
lips
moved
as
if
in
prayer
of
laputa
i
saw
only
the
back
and
his
head
was
bowed
suddenly
a
rapt
cry
broke
from
the
keeper
has
spoken
he
cried
path
is
clear
the
snake
returns
to
the
house
of
its
birth
an
attendant
led
forward
a
black
goat
which
bleated
feebly
with
a
huge
antique
knife
the
old
man
slit
its
throat
catching
the
blood
in
a
stone
ewer
some
was
flung
on
the
fire
which
had
burned
small
and
low
so
cried
the
priest
the
king
quench
in
blood
the
of
his
foes
then
on
laputa
forehead
and
bare
breast
he
drew
a
bloody
cross
seal
thee
said
the
voice
and
king
of
god
people
the
ewer
was
carried
round
the
assembly
and
each
dipped
his
finger
in
it
and
marked
his
forehead
i
got
a
dab
to
add
to
the
other
marks
on
my
face
and
king
of
god
people
said
the
voice
again
call
thee
to
the
inheritance
of
john
priest
and
king
was
he
king
of
kings
lord
of
hosts
master
of
the
earth
when
he
ascended
on
high
he
left
to
his
son
the
sacred
snake
the
ark
of
his
valour
to
be
god
dower
and
pledge
to
the
people
whom
he
has
chosen
i
could
not
make
out
what
followed
it
seemed
to
be
a
long
roll
of
the
kings
who
had
borne
the
snake
none
of
them
i
knew
but
at
the
end
i
thought
i
caught
the
name
of
tchaka
the
terrible
and
i
remembered
arcoll
tale
the
keeper
held
in
his
arms
a
box
of
curiously
wrought
ivory
about
two
feet
long
and
one
broad
he
was
standing
beyond
the
ashes
from
which
in
spite
of
the
blood
thin
streams
of
smoke
still
ascended
he
opened
it
and
drew
out
something
which
swung
from
his
hand
like
a
cascade
of
red
fire
the
snake
cried
the
keeper
and
every
man
in
the
assembly
excepting
laputa
and
including
me
bowed
his
head
to
the
ground
and
cried
who
have
seen
the
snake
came
the
voice
you
is
the
vow
of
silence
and
peace
no
blood
shall
ye
shed
of
man
or
beast
no
flesh
shall
ye
eat
till
the
vow
is
taken
from
you
from
the
hour
of
midnight
till
sunrise
on
the
second
day
ye
are
bound
to
god
whoever
shall
break
the
vow
on
him
shall
the
curse
fall
his
blood
shall
dry
in
his
veins
and
his
flesh
shrink
on
his
bones
he
shall
be
an
outlaw
and
accursed
and
there
shall
follow
him
through
life
and
death
the
avengers
of
the
snake
choose
ye
my
people
upon
you
is
the
vow
by
this
time
we
were
all
flat
on
our
faces
and
a
great
cry
of
assent
went
up
i
lifted
my
head
as
much
as
i
dared
to
see
what
would
happen
next
the
priest
raised
the
necklace
till
it
shone
above
his
head
like
a
halo
of
blood
i
have
never
seen
such
a
jewel
and
i
think
there
has
never
been
another
such
on
earth
later
i
was
to
have
the
handling
of
it
and
could
examine
it
closely
though
now
i
had
only
a
glimpse
there
were
rubies
in
it
the
largest
as
big
as
a
pigeon
egg
and
the
least
not
smaller
than
my
thumbnail
in
shape
they
were
oval
cut
on
both
sides
en
cabochon
and
on
each
certain
characters
were
engraved
no
doubt
this
detracted
from
their
value
as
gems
yet
the
characters
might
have
been
removed
and
the
stones
cut
in
facets
and
these
rubies
would
still
have
been
the
noblest
in
the
world
i
was
no
jewel
merchant
to
guess
their
value
but
i
knew
enough
to
see
that
here
was
wealth
beyond
human
computation
at
each
end
of
the
string
was
a
great
pearl
and
a
golden
clasp
the
sight
absorbed
me
to
the
exclusion
of
all
fear
i
david
crawfurd
nineteen
years
of
age
an
in
a
dorp
was
privileged
to
see
a
sight
to
which
no
portuguese
adventurer
had
ever
attained
there
floating
on
the
was
the
jewel
which
may
once
have
burned
in
sheba
hair
as
the
priest
held
the
collar
aloft
the
assembly
rocked
with
a
strange
passion
foreheads
were
rubbed
in
the
dust
and
then
adoring
eyes
would
be
raised
while
a
kind
of
sobbing
shook
the
worshippers
in
that
moment
i
learned
something
of
the
secret
of
africa
of
prester
john
empire
and
tchaka
victories
the
name
of
god
came
the
voice
deliver
to
the
heir
of
john
the
snake
of
john
laputa
took
the
necklet
and
twined
it
in
two
loops
round
his
neck
till
the
clasp
hung
down
over
his
breast
the
position
changed
the
priest
knelt
before
him
and
received
his
hands
on
his
head
then
i
knew
that
to
the
confusion
of
all
talk
about
equality
god
has
ordained
some
men
to
be
kings
and
others
to
serve
laputa
stood
naked
as
when
he
was
born
the
rubies
were
dulled
against
the
background
of
his
skin
but
they
still
shone
with
a
dusky
fire
above
the
collar
his
face
had
the
passive
pride
of
a
roman
emperor
only
his
great
eyes
gloomed
and
burned
as
he
looked
on
his
followers
of
john
he
said
stand
before
you
as
priest
and
king
my
kingship
is
for
the
morrow
now
i
am
the
priest
to
make
intercession
for
my
people
he
prayed
prayed
as
i
never
heard
man
pray
before
and
to
the
god
of
israel
it
was
no
heathen
fetich
he
was
invoking
but
the
god
of
whom
he
had
often
preached
in
christian
kirks
i
recognized
texts
from
isaiah
and
the
psalms
and
the
gospels
and
very
especially
from
the
two
last
chapters
of
revelation
he
pled
with
god
to
forget
the
sins
of
his
people
to
recall
the
bondage
of
zion
it
was
amazing
to
hear
these
bloodthirsty
savages
consecrated
by
their
leader
to
the
meek
service
of
christ
an
enthusiast
may
deceive
himself
and
i
did
not
question
his
sincerity
i
knew
his
heart
black
with
all
the
lusts
of
paganism
i
knew
that
his
purpose
was
to
deluge
the
land
with
blood
but
i
knew
also
that
in
his
eyes
his
mission
was
divine
and
that
he
felt
behind
him
all
the
armies
of
heaven
hast
been
a
strength
to
the
poor
said
the
voice
refuge
from
the
storm
a
shadow
from
the
heat
when
the
blast
of
the
terrible
ones
is
as
a
storm
against
a
shalt
bring
down
the
noise
of
strangers
as
the
heat
in
a
dry
place
the
branch
of
the
terrible
ones
shall
be
brought
in
this
mountain
shall
the
lord
of
hosts
make
unto
all
people
a
feast
of
fat
things
a
feast
of
wines
on
the
lees
of
fat
things
full
of
he
will
destroy
in
this
mountain
the
face
of
the
covering
cast
over
all
people
and
the
vail
that
is
brought
over
all
the
rebuke
of
his
people
shall
he
take
away
from
off
all
the
earth
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
it
i
listened
spellbound
as
he
prayed
i
heard
the
phrases
familiar
to
me
in
my
schooldays
at
kirkcaple
he
had
some
of
the
tones
of
my
voice
and
when
i
shut
my
eyes
i
could
have
believed
myself
a
child
again
so
much
he
had
got
from
his
apprenticeship
to
the
ministry
i
wondered
vaguely
what
the
good
folks
who
had
listened
to
him
in
churches
and
halls
at
home
would
think
of
him
now
but
there
was
in
the
prayer
more
than
the
supplications
of
the
quondam
preacher
there
was
a
tone
of
arrogant
pride
the
pride
of
the
man
to
whom
the
almighty
is
only
another
and
greater
lord
of
hosts
he
prayed
less
as
a
suppliant
than
as
an
ally
a
strange
emotion
tingled
in
my
blood
half
awe
half
sympathy
as
i
have
said
i
understood
that
there
are
men
born
to
kingship
he
ceased
with
a
benediction
then
he
put
on
his
cloak
and
kilt
and
received
from
the
kneeling
chief
a
spear
and
shield
now
he
was
more
king
than
priest
more
barbarian
than
christian
it
was
as
a
king
that
he
now
spoke
i
had
heard
him
on
board
the
liner
and
had
thought
his
voice
the
most
wonderful
i
had
ever
met
with
but
now
in
that
great
resonant
hall
the
magic
of
it
was
doubled
he
played
upon
the
souls
of
his
hearers
as
on
a
musical
instrument
at
will
he
struck
the
chords
of
pride
fury
hate
and
mad
joy
now
they
would
be
hushed
in
breathless
quiet
and
now
the
place
would
echo
with
savage
assent
i
remember
noticing
that
the
face
of
my
neighbour
was
running
with
tears
he
spoke
of
the
great
days
of
prester
john
and
a
hundred
names
i
had
never
heard
of
he
pictured
the
heroic
age
of
his
nation
when
every
man
was
a
warrior
and
hunter
and
rich
kraals
stood
in
the
spots
now
desecrated
by
the
white
man
and
cattle
wandered
on
a
thousand
hills
then
he
told
tales
of
white
infamy
lands
snatched
from
their
rightful
possessors
unjust
laws
which
forced
the
ethiopian
to
the
bondage
of
a
despised
caste
the
finger
of
scorn
everywhere
and
the
mocking
word
if
it
be
the
part
of
an
orator
to
rouse
the
passion
of
his
hearers
laputa
was
the
greatest
on
earth
have
ye
gained
from
the
white
man
he
cried
bastard
civilization
which
has
sapped
your
manhood
a
false
religion
which
would
rivet
on
you
the
chains
of
the
slave
ye
the
old
masters
of
the
land
are
now
the
servants
of
the
oppressor
and
yet
the
oppressors
are
few
and
the
fear
of
you
is
in
their
hearts
they
feast
in
their
great
cities
but
they
see
the
writing
on
the
wall
and
their
eyes
are
anxiously
turning
lest
the
enemy
be
at
their
gates
i
can
not
hope
in
my
prosaic
words
to
reproduce
that
amazing
discourse
phrases
which
the
hearers
had
heard
at
mission
schools
now
suddenly
appeared
not
as
the
white
man
learning
but
as
god
message
to
his
own
laputa
fitted
the
key
to
the
cipher
and
the
meaning
was
clear
he
concluded
i
remember
with
a
picture
of
the
overthrow
of
the
alien
and
the
golden
age
which
would
dawn
for
the
oppressed
another
ethiopian
empire
would
arise
so
majestic
that
the
white
man
everywhere
would
dread
its
name
so
righteous
that
all
men
under
it
would
live
in
ease
and
peace
by
rights
i
suppose
my
blood
should
have
been
boiling
at
this
treason
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
it
did
nothing
of
the
sort
my
mind
was
mesmerized
by
this
amazing
man
i
could
not
refrain
from
shouting
with
the
rest
indeed
i
was
a
convert
if
there
can
be
conversion
when
the
emotions
are
dominant
and
there
is
no
assent
from
the
brain
i
had
a
mad
desire
to
be
of
laputa
party
or
rather
i
longed
for
a
leader
who
should
master
me
and
make
my
soul
his
own
as
this
man
mastered
his
followers
i
have
already
said
that
i
might
have
made
a
good
subaltern
soldier
and
the
proof
is
that
i
longed
for
such
a
general
as
the
voice
ceased
there
was
a
deep
silence
the
hearers
were
in
a
sort
of
trance
their
eyes
fixed
glassily
on
laputa
face
it
was
the
quiet
of
tense
nerves
and
imagination
at
i
had
to
struggle
with
a
spell
which
gripped
me
equally
with
the
wildest
savage
i
forced
myself
to
look
round
at
the
strained
faces
the
wall
of
the
cascade
the
line
of
torches
it
was
the
sight
of
henriques
that
broke
the
charm
here
was
one
who
had
no
part
in
the
emotion
i
caught
his
eye
fixed
on
the
rubies
and
in
it
i
read
only
a
devouring
greed
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
laputa
had
a
foe
in
his
own
camp
and
the
prester
collar
a
votary
whose
passion
was
not
that
of
worship
the
next
thing
i
remember
was
a
movement
among
the
first
ranks
the
chiefs
were
swearing
fealty
laputa
took
off
the
collar
and
called
god
to
witness
that
it
should
never
again
encircle
his
neck
till
he
had
led
his
people
to
victory
then
one
by
one
the
great
chiefs
and
indunas
advanced
and
swore
allegiance
with
their
foreheads
on
the
ivory
box
such
a
collection
of
races
has
never
been
seen
there
were
tall
zulus
and
swazis
with
and
feather
there
were
men
from
the
north
with
heavy
brass
collars
and
anklets
men
with
quills
in
their
ears
and
earrings
and
shaven
heads
and
heads
with
wonderfully
twisted
hair
bodies
naked
or
all
but
naked
and
bodies
adorned
with
skins
and
necklets
some
were
light
in
colour
and
some
were
black
as
coal
some
had
squat
negro
features
and
some
thin
arab
faces
but
in
all
there
was
the
air
of
mad
enthusiasm
for
a
day
they
were
forsworn
from
blood
but
their
wild
eyes
and
twitching
hands
told
their
future
purpose
for
an
hour
or
two
i
had
been
living
in
a
suddenly
my
absorption
was
shattered
for
i
saw
that
my
time
to
swear
was
coming
i
sat
in
the
extreme
back
row
at
the
end
nearest
the
entrance
and
therefore
i
should
naturally
be
the
last
to
go
forward
the
crisis
was
near
when
i
should
be
discovered
for
there
was
no
question
of
my
shirking
the
oath
then
for
the
first
time
since
i
entered
the
cave
i
realized
the
frightful
danger
in
which
i
stood
my
mind
had
been
strung
so
high
by
the
ritual
that
i
had
forgotten
all
else
now
came
the
rebound
and
with
shaky
nerves
i
had
to
face
discovery
and
certain
punishment
in
that
moment
i
suffered
the
worst
terror
of
my
life
there
was
much
to
come
later
but
by
that
time
my
senses
were
dulled
now
they
had
been
sharpened
by
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
my
nerves
were
already
quivering
and
my
fancy
on
fire
i
felt
every
limb
shaking
as
went
forward
the
cave
swam
before
my
eyes
heads
were
multiplied
giddily
and
i
was
only
dimly
conscious
when
he
rose
to
return
nothing
would
have
made
me
advance
had
i
not
feared
laputa
less
than
my
neighbours
they
might
rend
me
to
pieces
but
to
him
the
oath
was
inviolable
i
staggered
crazily
to
my
feet
and
shambled
forwards
my
eye
was
fixed
on
the
ivory
box
and
it
seemed
to
dance
before
me
and
retreat
suddenly
i
heard
a
voice
the
voice
of
henriques
cry
god
a
spy
i
felt
my
throat
caught
but
i
was
beyond
resisting
it
was
released
and
i
was
pinned
by
the
arms
i
must
have
stood
vacantly
with
a
foolish
smile
while
unchained
fury
raged
round
me
i
seemed
to
hear
laputa
voice
saying
is
the
storekeeper
his
face
was
all
that
i
could
see
and
it
was
unperturbed
there
was
a
mocking
ghost
of
a
smile
about
his
lips
myriad
hands
seemed
to
grip
me
and
crush
my
breath
but
above
the
clamour
i
heard
a
fierce
word
of
command
after
that
i
fainted
chapter
xii
captain
arcoll
sends
a
message
i
once
read
i
think
in
some
latin
writer
the
story
of
a
man
who
was
crushed
to
a
jelly
by
the
mere
repeated
touch
of
many
thousand
hands
his
murderers
were
not
harsh
but
an
infinite
repetition
of
the
gentlest
handling
meant
death
i
do
not
suppose
that
i
was
very
brutally
manhandled
in
the
cave
i
was
trussed
up
tight
and
carried
out
to
the
open
and
left
in
the
care
of
the
guards
but
when
my
senses
returned
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
cruelly
beaten
in
every
part
the
bonds
chafed
my
wrists
and
ankle
and
shoulders
but
they
were
the
least
part
of
my
aches
to
be
handled
by
a
multitude
of
kaffirs
is
like
being
shaken
by
some
wild
animal
their
skins
are
insensible
to
pain
and
i
have
seen
a
zulu
stand
on
a
piece
of
iron
without
noticing
it
till
he
was
warned
by
the
smell
of
burning
hide
anyhow
after
i
had
been
bound
by
kaffir
hands
and
tossed
on
kaffir
shoulders
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
in
a
scrimmage
of
mad
bulls
i
found
myself
lying
looking
up
at
the
moon
it
was
the
edge
of
the
bush
and
all
around
was
the
stir
of
the
army
getting
ready
for
the
road
you
know
how
a
native
babbles
and
chatters
over
any
work
he
has
to
do
it
says
much
for
laputa
iron
hand
that
now
everything
was
done
in
silence
i
heard
the
nickering
of
horses
and
the
jolt
of
carts
as
they
turned
from
the
bush
into
the
path
there
was
the
sound
of
hurried
whispering
and
now
and
then
a
sharp
command
and
all
the
while
i
lay
staring
at
the
moon
and
wondering
if
i
was
going
to
keep
my
reason
if
he
who
reads
this
doubts
the
discomfort
of
bonds
let
him
try
them
for
himself
let
him
be
bound
foot
and
hand
and
left
alone
and
in
half
an
hour
he
will
be
screaming
for
release
the
sense
of
impotence
is
stifling
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
buried
in
some
landslip
instead
of
lying
under
the
open
sky
with
the
night
wind
fanning
my
face
i
was
in
the
second
stage
of
panic
which
is
next
door
to
collapse
i
tried
to
cry
but
could
only
raise
a
squeak
like
a
bat
a
wheel
started
to
run
round
in
my
head
and
when
i
looked
at
the
moon
i
saw
that
it
was
rotating
in
time
things
were
very
bad
with
me
it
was
who
saved
me
from
lunacy
he
had
been
appointed
my
keeper
and
the
first
i
knew
of
it
was
a
violent
kick
in
the
ribs
i
rolled
over
on
the
grass
down
a
short
slope
the
brute
squatted
beside
me
and
prodded
me
with
his
baas
he
said
in
his
queer
english
you
ordered
me
out
of
your
store
and
treated
me
like
a
dog
it
is
turn
now
you
are
dog
and
he
will
skin
you
with
a
sjambok
soon
my
wandering
wits
were
coming
back
to
me
i
looked
into
his
bloodshot
eyes
and
saw
what
i
had
to
expect
the
cheerful
savage
went
on
to
discuss
just
the
kind
of
beating
i
should
get
from
him
my
bones
were
to
be
uncovered
till
the
lash
curled
round
my
heart
then
the
jackals
would
have
the
rest
of
me
this
was
ordinary
kaffir
brag
and
it
made
me
angry
but
i
thought
it
best
to
go
cannily
i
am
to
be
your
slave
i
managed
to
say
would
be
a
pity
to
beat
me
so
hard
you
would
get
no
more
work
out
of
me
grinned
wickedly
are
my
slave
for
a
day
and
a
night
after
that
we
kill
you
slowly
you
will
burn
till
your
legs
fall
off
and
your
knees
are
on
the
ground
and
then
you
will
be
chopped
small
with
knives
thank
god
my
courage
and
common
sense
were
coming
back
to
me
happens
to
me
i
said
the
inkulu
business
not
yours
i
am
his
prisoner
but
if
you
lift
your
hand
on
me
so
as
to
draw
one
drop
of
blood
the
inkulu
will
make
short
work
of
you
the
vow
is
upon
you
and
if
you
break
it
you
know
what
happens
and
i
repeated
in
a
fair
imitation
of
the
priest
voice
the
terrible
curse
he
had
pronounced
in
the
cave
you
should
have
seen
the
change
in
that
cur
face
i
had
guessed
he
was
a
coward
as
he
was
most
certainly
a
bully
and
now
i
knew
it
he
shivered
and
drew
his
hand
over
his
eyes
baas
he
pleaded
was
but
a
joke
no
harm
shall
come
on
you
but
tomorrow
and
his
ugly
face
grew
more
cheerful
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
i
said
stoically
and
a
loud
sounded
through
the
camp
it
was
the
signal
for
moving
for
in
the
east
a
thin
pale
line
of
gold
was
beginning
to
show
over
the
trees
the
bonds
at
my
knees
and
ankles
were
cut
and
i
was
bundled
on
to
the
back
of
a
horse
then
my
feet
were
strapped
firmly
below
its
belly
the
bridle
of
my
beast
was
tied
to
so
that
there
was
little
chance
of
escape
even
if
i
had
been
unshackled
my
thoughts
were
very
gloomy
so
far
all
had
happened
as
i
planned
but
i
seemed
to
have
lost
my
nerve
and
i
could
not
believe
in
my
rescue
at
the
letaba
while
i
thought
of
inanda
kraal
with
sheer
horror
last
night
i
had
looked
into
the
heart
of
darkness
and
the
sight
had
terrified
me
what
part
should
i
play
in
the
great
purification
most
likely
that
of
the
biblical
scapegoat
but
the
dolour
of
my
mind
was
surpassed
by
the
discomfort
of
my
body
i
was
broken
with
pains
and
weariness
and
i
had
a
desperate
headache
also
before
we
had
gone
a
mile
i
began
to
think
that
i
should
split
in
two
the
paces
of
my
beast
were
uneven
to
say
the
best
of
it
and
the
was
like
being
on
the
rack
i
remembered
that
the
saints
of
the
covenant
used
to
journey
to
prison
this
way
especially
the
great
mr
peden
and
i
wondered
how
they
liked
it
when
i
hear
of
a
man
doing
a
brave
deed
i
always
want
to
discover
whether
at
the
time
he
was
well
and
comfortable
in
body
that
i
am
certain
is
the
biggest
ingredient
in
courage
and
those
who
plan
and
execute
great
deeds
in
bodily
weakness
have
my
homage
as
truly
heroic
for
myself
i
had
not
the
spirit
of
a
chicken
as
i
jogged
along
at
side
i
wished
he
would
begin
to
insult
me
if
only
to
distract
my
mind
but
he
kept
obstinately
silent
he
was
sulky
and
i
think
rather
afraid
of
me
as
the
sun
got
up
i
could
see
something
of
the
host
around
me
i
am
no
hand
at
guessing
numbers
but
i
should
put
the
fighting
men
i
saw
at
not
less
than
twenty
thousand
every
man
of
them
was
on
this
side
his
prime
and
all
were
armed
with
good
rifles
and
bandoliers
there
were
none
of
your
old
roers
and
decrepit
enfields
which
i
had
seen
signs
of
in
kaffir
kraals
these
guns
were
new
serviceable
mausers
and
the
men
who
bore
them
looked
as
if
they
knew
how
to
handle
them
there
must
have
been
long
months
of
training
behind
this
show
and
i
marvelled
at
the
man
who
had
organized
it
i
saw
no
and
the
little
transport
they
had
was
evidently
for
food
only
we
did
not
travel
in
ranks
like
an
orthodox
column
about
a
third
of
the
force
was
mounted
and
this
formed
the
centre
on
each
wing
the
infantry
straggled
far
afield
but
there
was
method
in
their
disorder
for
in
the
bush
close
ranks
would
have
been
impossible
at
any
rate
we
kept
wonderfully
well
together
and
when
we
mounted
a
knoll
the
whole
army
seemed
to
move
in
one
piece
i
was
well
in
the
rear
of
the
centre
column
but
from
the
crest
of
a
slope
i
sometimes
got
a
view
in
front
i
could
see
nothing
of
laputa
who
was
probably
with
the
van
but
in
the
very
heart
of
the
force
i
saw
the
old
priest
of
the
snake
with
his
treasure
carried
in
the
kind
of
litter
which
the
portuguese
call
a
machila
between
rows
of
guards
a
white
man
rode
beside
him
whom
i
judged
to
be
henriques
laputa
trusted
this
fellow
and
i
wondered
why
i
had
not
forgotten
the
look
on
his
face
while
he
had
stared
at
the
rubies
in
the
cave
i
had
a
notion
that
the
portugoose
might
be
an
unsuspected
ally
of
mine
though
for
blackguard
reasons
about
ten
as
far
as
i
could
judge
by
the
sun
we
passed
umvelos
and
took
the
right
bank
of
the
labongo
there
was
nothing
in
the
store
to
loot
but
it
was
overrun
by
kaffirs
who
carried
off
the
benches
for
firewood
it
gave
me
an
odd
feeling
to
see
the
remains
of
the
meal
at
which
i
had
entertained
laputa
in
the
hands
of
a
dozen
warriors
i
thought
of
the
long
sunny
days
when
i
had
sat
by
my
nachtmaal
while
the
dutch
farmers
rode
in
to
trade
now
these
men
were
all
dead
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
same
bourne
soon
the
blue
line
of
the
berg
rose
in
the
west
and
through
the
corner
of
my
eye
as
i
rode
i
could
see
the
gap
of
the
klein
labongo
i
wondered
if
arcoll
and
his
men
were
up
there
watching
us
about
this
time
i
began
to
be
so
wretched
in
body
that
i
ceased
to
think
of
the
future
i
had
had
no
food
for
seventeen
hours
and
i
was
dropping
from
lack
of
sleep
the
ache
of
my
bones
was
so
great
that
i
found
myself
crying
like
a
baby
what
between
pain
and
weakness
and
nervous
exhaustion
i
was
almost
at
the
end
of
my
tether
and
should
have
fainted
dead
away
if
a
halt
had
not
been
called
but
about
midday
after
we
had
crossed
the
track
from
blaauwildebeestefontein
to
the
portuguese
frontier
we
came
to
the
broad
shallow
drift
of
the
klein
labongo
it
is
the
way
of
the
kaffirs
to
rest
at
noon
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
drift
we
encamped
i
remember
the
smell
of
hot
earth
and
clean
water
as
my
horse
scrambled
up
the
bank
then
came
the
smell
of
as
fires
were
lit
it
seemed
an
age
after
we
stopped
before
my
feet
were
loosed
and
i
was
allowed
to
fall
over
on
the
ground
i
lay
like
a
log
where
i
fell
and
was
asleep
in
ten
seconds
i
awoke
two
hours
later
much
refreshed
and
with
a
raging
hunger
my
ankles
and
knees
had
been
tied
again
but
the
sleep
had
taken
the
worst
stiffness
out
of
my
joints
the
natives
were
squatting
in
groups
round
their
fires
but
no
one
came
near
me
i
satisfied
myself
by
straining
at
my
bonds
that
this
solitude
gave
no
chance
of
escape
i
wanted
food
and
i
shouted
on
but
he
never
came
then
i
rolled
over
into
the
shadow
of
a
bush
to
get
out
of
the
glare
i
saw
a
kaffir
on
the
other
side
of
the
bush
who
seemed
to
be
grinning
at
me
slowly
he
moved
round
to
my
side
and
stood
regarding
me
with
interest
god
sake
get
me
some
food
i
said
baas
was
the
answer
and
he
disappeared
for
a
minute
and
returned
with
a
wooden
bowl
of
hot
porridge
and
a
calabash
full
of
water
i
could
not
use
my
hands
so
he
fed
me
with
the
blade
of
his
knife
such
porridge
without
salt
or
cream
is
beastly
food
but
my
hunger
was
so
great
that
i
could
have
eaten
a
vat
of
it
suddenly
it
appeared
that
the
kaffir
had
something
to
say
to
me
as
he
fed
me
he
began
to
speak
in
a
low
voice
in
english
he
said
come
from
ratitswan
and
i
have
a
message
for
you
i
guessed
that
ratitswan
was
the
native
name
for
arcoll
there
was
no
one
else
likely
to
send
a
message
says
he
went
on
out
for
dupree
drift
i
will
be
near
you
and
cut
your
bonds
then
you
must
swim
across
when
ratitswan
begins
to
shoot
the
news
took
all
the
weight
of
care
from
my
mind
colin
had
got
home
and
my
friends
were
out
for
rescue
so
volatile
is
the
mood
of
that
i
veered
round
from
black
despair
to
an
unwarranted
optimism
i
saw
myself
already
safe
and
laputa
rising
scattered
i
saw
my
hands
on
the
treasure
and
henriques
ugly
neck
below
my
heel
do
know
your
name
i
said
to
the
kaffir
you
are
a
good
fellow
when
i
get
out
of
this
business
i
wo
forget
you
is
another
message
baas
he
said
is
written
on
paper
in
a
strange
tongue
turn
your
head
to
the
bush
and
see
i
will
hold
it
inside
the
bowl
that
you
may
read
it
i
did
as
i
was
told
and
found
myself
looking
at
a
dirty
of
notepaper
marked
by
the
kaffir
thumbs
some
words
were
written
on
it
in
wardlaw
hand
and
characteristically
in
latin
which
was
not
a
bad
cipher
i
read
de
letaba
transeunda
apud
duprei
vada
jam
nos
certiores
i
had
guessed
rightly
henriques
was
a
traitor
to
the
cause
he
had
espoused
arcoll
message
had
given
me
new
heart
but
wardlaw
gave
me
information
of
tremendous
value
i
repented
that
i
had
ever
underrated
the
schoolmaster
sense
he
did
not
come
out
of
aberdeen
for
nothing
i
asked
the
kaffir
how
far
it
was
to
dupree
drift
and
was
told
three
hours
march
we
should
get
there
after
the
darkening
it
seemed
he
had
permission
to
ride
with
me
instead
of
who
had
no
love
for
the
job
how
he
managed
this
i
do
not
know
but
arcoll
men
had
their
own
ways
of
doing
things
he
undertook
to
set
me
free
when
the
first
shot
was
fired
at
the
ford
meantime
i
bade
him
leave
me
to
avert
suspicion
there
is
a
story
of
one
of
king
arthur
knights
sir
percival
i
think
that
once
riding
through
a
forest
he
found
a
lion
fighting
with
a
serpent
he
drew
his
sword
and
helped
the
lion
for
he
thought
it
was
the
more
natural
beast
of
the
two
to
me
laputa
was
the
lion
and
henriques
the
serpent
and
though
i
had
no
good
will
to
either
i
was
determined
to
spoil
the
serpent
game
he
was
after
the
rubies
as
i
had
fancied
he
had
never
been
after
anything
else
he
had
found
out
about
arcoll
preparations
and
had
sent
him
a
warning
hoping
no
doubt
that
if
laputa
force
was
scattered
on
the
letaba
he
would
have
a
chance
of
getting
off
with
the
necklace
in
the
confusion
if
he
succeeded
he
would
go
over
the
lebombo
to
mozambique
and
whatever
happened
afterwards
in
the
rising
would
be
no
concern
of
mr
henriques
i
determined
that
he
should
fail
but
how
to
manage
it
i
could
not
see
had
i
had
a
pistol
i
think
i
would
have
shot
him
but
i
had
no
weapon
of
any
kind
i
could
not
warn
laputa
for
that
would
seal
my
own
fate
even
if
i
were
believed
it
was
clear
that
laputa
must
go
to
drift
for
otherwise
i
could
not
escape
and
it
was
equally
clear
that
i
must
find
the
means
of
spoiling
the
portugoose
game
a
shadow
fell
across
the
sunlight
and
i
looked
up
to
see
the
man
i
was
thinking
of
standing
before
me
he
had
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
and
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
he
stood
eyeing
me
with
a
curious
smile
on
his
face
mr
storekeeper
he
said
and
i
have
met
before
under
pleasanter
circumstances
i
said
nothing
my
mind
being
busy
with
what
to
do
at
the
drift
were
shipmates
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
said
dare
say
you
found
it
nicer
work
smoking
on
the
than
lying
here
in
the
sun
still
i
said
nothing
if
the
man
had
come
to
mock
me
he
would
get
no
change
out
of
david
crawfurd
tut
do
be
sulky
you
have
no
quarrel
with
me
between
ourselves
and
he
dropped
his
voice
tried
to
save
you
but
you
had
seen
rather
too
much
to
be
safe
what
devil
prompted
you
to
steal
a
horse
and
go
to
the
cave
i
do
blame
you
for
overhearing
us
but
if
you
had
had
the
sense
of
a
louse
you
would
have
gone
off
to
the
berg
with
your
news
by
the
way
how
did
you
manage
it
a
cellar
i
suppose
our
friend
laputa
was
a
fool
not
to
take
better
precautions
but
i
must
say
you
acted
the
drunkard
pretty
well
the
vanity
of
is
an
incalculable
thing
i
rose
to
the
fly
know
the
kind
of
precaution
you
wanted
to
take
i
muttered
heard
that
too
well
i
confess
i
am
in
favour
of
doing
a
job
thoroughly
when
i
take
it
up
the
koodoo
flats
for
example
i
said
he
sat
down
beside
me
and
laughed
softly
heard
my
little
story
you
are
clever
mr
storekeeper
but
not
quite
clever
enough
what
if
i
can
act
a
part
as
well
as
yourself
and
he
thrust
his
yellow
face
close
to
mine
i
saw
his
meaning
and
did
not
for
a
second
believe
him
but
i
had
the
sense
to
temporize
you
mean
to
say
that
you
did
not
kill
the
dutchmen
and
did
not
mean
to
knife
me
mean
to
say
that
i
am
not
a
fool
he
said
lighting
another
cigarette
am
a
white
man
mr
storekeeper
and
i
play
the
white
man
game
why
do
you
think
i
am
here
simply
because
i
was
the
only
man
in
africa
who
had
the
pluck
to
get
to
the
heart
of
this
business
i
am
here
to
dish
laputa
and
by
god
i
am
going
to
do
it
i
was
scarcely
prepared
for
such
incredible
bluff
i
knew
every
word
was
a
lie
but
i
wanted
to
hear
more
for
the
man
fascinated
me
suppose
you
know
what
will
happen
to
you
he
said
flicking
the
ashes
from
his
cigarette
at
inanda
kraal
when
the
vow
is
over
they
will
give
you
a
taste
of
kaffir
habits
not
death
my
friend
that
would
be
simple
enough
but
a
slow
death
with
every
refinement
of
horror
you
have
broken
into
their
sacred
places
and
you
will
be
sacrificed
to
laputa
god
i
have
seen
native
torture
before
and
his
own
mother
would
run
away
shrieking
from
a
man
who
had
endured
it
i
said
nothing
but
the
thought
made
my
flesh
creep
he
went
on
in
an
awkward
plight
but
i
think
i
can
help
you
what
if
i
can
save
your
life
mr
storekeeper
you
are
trussed
up
like
a
fowl
and
can
do
nothing
i
am
the
only
man
alive
who
can
help
you
i
am
willing
to
do
it
too
on
my
own
terms
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
those
terms
for
i
had
a
shrewd
guess
what
they
would
be
my
hatred
of
henriques
rose
and
choked
me
i
saw
murder
and
trickery
in
his
mean
eyes
and
cruel
mouth
i
could
not
to
be
saved
from
the
uttermost
horror
have
made
myself
his
ally
listen
mr
portugoose
i
cried
tell
me
you
are
a
spy
what
if
i
shout
that
through
the
camp
there
will
be
short
shrift
for
you
if
laputa
hears
it
he
laughed
loudly
are
a
bigger
fool
than
i
took
you
for
who
would
believe
you
my
friend
not
laputa
not
any
man
in
this
army
it
would
only
mean
tighter
bonds
for
these
long
legs
of
yours
by
this
time
i
had
given
up
all
thought
of
diplomacy
well
you
devil
you
will
hear
my
answer
i
would
not
take
my
freedom
from
you
though
i
were
to
be
boiled
alive
i
know
you
for
a
traitor
to
the
white
man
cause
a
dirty
swindler
whose
name
is
a
byword
among
honest
men
by
your
own
confession
you
are
a
traitor
to
this
idiot
rising
you
murdered
the
dutchmen
and
god
knows
how
many
more
and
you
would
fain
have
murdered
me
i
pray
to
heaven
that
the
men
whose
cause
you
have
betrayed
and
the
men
whose
cause
you
would
betray
may
join
to
stamp
the
life
out
of
you
and
send
your
soul
to
hell
i
know
the
game
you
would
have
me
join
in
and
i
fling
your
offer
in
your
face
but
i
tell
you
one
thing
you
are
damned
yourself
the
white
men
are
out
and
you
will
never
get
over
the
lebombo
from
black
or
white
you
will
get
justice
before
many
hours
and
your
carcass
will
be
left
to
rot
in
the
bush
get
out
of
my
sight
you
swine
in
that
moment
i
was
so
borne
up
in
my
passion
that
i
forgot
my
bonds
and
my
grave
danger
i
was
inspired
like
a
prophet
with
a
sense
of
approaching
retribution
henriques
heard
me
out
but
his
smile
changed
to
a
scowl
and
a
flush
rose
on
his
sallow
cheek
in
your
own
juice
he
said
and
spat
in
my
face
then
he
shouted
in
kaffir
that
i
had
insulted
him
and
demanded
that
i
should
be
bound
tighter
and
gagged
it
was
arcoll
messenger
who
answered
his
summons
that
admirable
fellow
rushed
at
me
with
a
great
appearance
of
savagery
he
made
a
pretence
of
swathing
me
up
in
fresh
rawhide
ropes
but
his
knots
were
loose
and
the
thing
was
a
farce
he
gagged
me
with
what
looked
like
a
piece
of
wood
but
was
in
reality
a
chunk
of
dry
banana
and
all
the
while
till
henriques
was
out
of
hearing
he
cursed
me
with
a
noble
gift
of
tongues
the
drums
beat
for
the
advance
and
once
more
i
was
hoisted
on
my
horse
while
arcoll
kaffir
tied
my
bridle
to
his
own
a
kaffir
can
not
wink
but
he
has
a
way
of
slanting
his
eyes
which
does
as
well
and
as
we
moved
on
he
would
turn
his
head
to
me
with
this
strange
grimace
henriques
wanted
me
to
help
him
to
get
the
rubies
that
i
presumed
was
the
offer
he
had
meant
to
make
well
thought
i
i
will
perish
before
the
jewel
reaches
the
portuguese
hands
he
hoped
for
a
stampede
when
arcoll
opposed
the
crossing
of
the
river
and
in
the
confusion
intended
to
steal
the
casket
my
plan
must
be
to
get
as
near
the
old
priest
as
possible
before
we
reached
the
ford
i
spoke
to
my
warder
and
told
him
what
i
wanted
he
nodded
and
in
the
first
mile
we
managed
to
edge
a
good
way
forward
several
things
came
to
aid
us
as
i
have
said
we
of
the
centre
were
not
marching
in
close
ranks
but
in
a
loose
column
and
often
it
was
possible
by
taking
a
short
cut
on
rough
ground
to
join
the
column
some
distance
ahead
there
was
a
vlei
too
which
many
circumvented
but
we
swam
and
this
helped
our
lead
in
a
couple
of
hours
we
were
so
near
the
priest
litter
that
i
could
have
easily
tossed
a
cricket
ball
on
the
head
of
henriques
who
rode
beside
it
very
soon
the
twilight
of
the
winter
day
began
to
fall
the
far
hills
grew
pink
and
mulberry
in
the
sunset
and
strange
shadows
stole
over
the
bush
still
creeping
forward
we
found
ourselves
not
twenty
yards
behind
the
litter
while
far
ahead
i
saw
a
broad
glimmering
space
of
water
with
a
high
woody
bank
beyond
drift
whispered
my
warder
inkoos
in
an
hour
time
you
will
be
free
boer
elephant
guns
has
already
told
us
about
the
crossing
at
drift
great
chief
chapter
xiii
the
drift
of
the
letaba
the
dusk
was
gathering
fast
as
we
neared
the
stream
from
the
stagnant
reaches
above
and
below
a
fine
white
mist
was
rising
but
the
long
shallows
of
the
ford
were
clear
my
heart
was
beginning
to
flutter
wildly
but
i
kept
a
tight
grip
on
myself
and
prayed
for
patience
as
i
stared
into
the
evening
my
hopes
sank
i
had
expected
foolishly
enough
to
see
on
the
far
bank
some
sign
of
my
friends
but
the
tall
bush
was
dead
and
silent
the
drift
slants
across
the
river
at
an
acute
angle
roughly
i
did
not
know
this
at
the
time
and
was
amazed
to
see
the
van
of
the
march
turn
apparently
up
stream
laputa
great
voice
rang
out
in
some
order
which
was
repeated
down
the
column
and
the
wide
flanks
of
the
force
converged
on
the
narrow
which
entered
the
water
we
had
come
to
a
standstill
while
the
front
ranks
began
the
passage
i
sat
shaking
with
excitement
my
eyes
straining
into
the
gloom
water
holds
the
evening
light
for
long
and
i
could
make
out
pretty
clearly
what
was
happening
the
leading
horsemen
rode
into
the
stream
with
laputa
in
front
the
ford
is
not
the
best
going
so
they
had
to
pick
their
way
but
in
five
or
ten
minutes
they
were
over
then
came
some
of
the
infantry
of
the
flanks
who
crossed
with
the
water
to
their
waists
and
their
guns
held
high
above
their
heads
they
made
a
portentous
splashing
but
not
a
sound
came
from
their
throats
i
shall
never
know
how
laputa
imposed
silence
on
the
most
noisy
race
on
earth
several
thousand
footmen
must
have
followed
the
riders
and
disappeared
into
the
far
bush
but
not
a
shot
came
from
the
bluffs
in
front
i
watched
with
a
sinking
heart
arcoll
had
failed
and
there
was
to
be
no
check
at
the
drift
there
remained
for
me
only
the
horrors
at
inanda
kraal
i
resolved
to
make
a
dash
for
freedom
at
all
costs
and
was
in
the
act
of
telling
arcoll
man
to
cut
my
bonds
when
a
thought
occurred
to
me
henriques
was
after
the
rubies
and
it
was
his
interest
to
get
laputa
across
the
river
before
the
attack
began
it
was
arcoll
business
to
split
the
force
and
above
all
to
hold
up
the
leader
henriques
would
tell
him
and
for
that
matter
he
must
have
assumed
himself
that
laputa
would
ride
in
the
centre
of
the
force
therefore
there
would
be
no
check
till
the
time
came
for
the
priest
litter
to
cross
it
was
well
that
i
had
not
had
my
bonds
cut
henriques
came
riding
towards
me
his
face
sharp
and
bright
as
a
ferret
he
pulled
up
and
asked
if
i
were
safe
my
kaffir
showed
my
strapped
elbows
and
feet
and
tugged
at
the
cords
to
prove
their
tightness
him
well
said
henriques
you
will
answer
to
inkulu
forward
with
him
now
and
get
him
through
the
water
then
he
turned
and
rode
back
my
warder
apparently
obeying
orders
led
me
out
of
the
column
and
into
the
bush
on
the
right
hand
soon
we
were
abreast
of
the
litter
and
some
twenty
yards
to
the
west
of
it
the
water
gleamed
through
the
trees
a
few
paces
in
front
i
could
see
the
masses
of
infantry
converging
on
the
drift
and
the
churning
like
a
cascade
which
they
made
in
the
passage
suddenly
from
the
far
bank
came
an
order
it
was
laputa
voice
thin
and
as
the
kaffir
cries
when
he
wishes
his
words
to
carry
a
great
distance
henriques
repeated
it
and
the
infantry
halted
the
riders
of
the
column
in
front
of
the
litter
began
to
move
into
the
stream
we
should
have
gone
with
them
but
instead
we
pulled
our
horses
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
bush
it
seemed
to
me
that
odd
things
were
happening
around
the
priest
litter
henriques
had
left
it
and
dashed
past
me
so
close
that
i
could
have
touched
him
from
somewhere
among
the
trees
a
cracked
into
the
air
as
if
in
answer
to
a
signal
the
high
bluff
across
the
stream
burst
into
a
sheet
of
fire
sheet
of
fire
sounds
odd
enough
for
scientific
warfare
i
saw
that
my
friends
were
using
and
firing
with
black
powder
into
the
mob
in
the
water
it
was
humane
and
it
was
good
tactics
for
the
flame
in
the
grey
dusk
had
the
appearance
of
a
heavy
battery
of
ordnance
once
again
i
heard
henriques
voice
he
was
turning
the
column
to
the
right
he
shouted
to
them
to
get
into
cover
and
take
the
water
higher
up
i
thought
too
that
from
far
away
i
heard
laputa
these
were
maddening
seconds
we
had
left
the
business
of
cutting
my
bonds
almost
too
late
in
the
darkness
of
the
bush
the
strips
of
hide
could
only
be
felt
for
and
my
kaffir
had
a
woefully
blunt
knife
reims
are
always
tough
to
sever
and
mine
had
to
be
sawn
through
soon
my
arms
were
free
and
i
was
plucking
at
my
other
bonds
the
worst
were
those
on
my
ankles
below
the
horse
belly
the
kaffir
fumbled
away
in
the
dark
and
pricked
my
beast
so
that
he
reared
and
struck
out
and
all
the
while
i
was
choking
with
impatience
and
gabbling
prayers
to
myself
the
men
on
the
other
side
had
begun
to
use
i
could
see
through
a
gap
the
centre
of
the
river
and
it
was
filled
with
a
mass
of
struggling
men
and
horses
i
remember
that
it
amazed
me
that
no
shot
was
fired
in
return
then
i
remembered
the
vow
and
was
still
more
amazed
at
the
power
of
a
ritual
on
that
savage
horde
the
column
was
moving
past
me
to
the
right
it
was
a
disorderly
rabble
which
obeyed
henriques
orders
bullets
began
to
sing
through
the
trees
and
one
rider
was
hit
in
the
shoulder
and
came
down
with
a
crash
this
increased
the
confusion
for
most
of
them
dismounted
and
tried
to
lead
their
horses
in
the
cover
the
infantry
coming
in
from
the
wings
collided
with
them
and
there
was
a
struggle
of
excited
beasts
and
men
in
the
thickets
of
thorn
and
mopani
and
still
my
kaffir
was
trying
to
get
my
ankles
loose
as
fast
as
a
plunging
horse
would
let
him
at
last
i
was
free
and
dropped
stiffly
to
the
ground
i
fell
prone
on
my
face
with
cramp
and
when
i
got
up
i
rolled
like
a
drunk
man
here
i
made
a
great
blunder
i
should
have
left
my
horse
with
my
kaffir
and
bidden
him
follow
me
but
i
was
too
eager
to
be
cautious
so
i
let
it
go
and
crying
to
the
kaffir
to
await
me
i
ran
towards
the
litter
henriques
had
laid
his
plans
well
the
column
had
abandoned
the
priest
and
by
the
litter
were
only
the
two
bearers
as
i
caught
sight
of
them
one
fell
with
a
bullet
in
his
chest
the
other
wild
with
fright
kept
turning
his
head
to
every
quarter
of
the
compass
another
bullet
passed
close
to
his
head
this
was
too
much
for
him
and
with
a
yell
he
ran
away
as
i
broke
through
the
thicket
i
looked
to
the
quarter
whence
the
bullets
had
come
these
i
could
have
taken
my
oath
were
not
fired
by
my
friends
on
the
farther
bank
it
was
shooting
and
i
knew
who
had
done
it
but
i
saw
nobody
the
last
few
yards
of
the
road
were
clear
and
only
out
in
the
water
was
the
struggling
shouting
mass
of
humanity
i
saw
a
tall
man
on
a
big
horse
plunge
into
the
river
on
his
way
back
it
must
be
laputa
returning
to
command
the
panic
my
business
was
not
with
laputa
but
with
henriques
the
old
priest
in
the
litter
who
had
been
sleeping
had
roused
himself
and
was
looking
vacantly
round
him
he
did
not
look
long
a
third
bullet
fired
from
a
dozen
yards
away
drilled
a
hole
in
his
forehead
he
fell
back
dead
and
the
ivory
box
which
lay
on
his
lap
tilted
forward
on
the
ground
i
had
no
weapon
of
any
kind
and
i
did
not
want
the
fourth
bullet
for
myself
henriques
was
too
pretty
a
shot
to
trifle
with
i
waited
quietly
on
the
edge
of
the
shade
till
the
portugoose
came
out
of
the
thicket
i
saw
him
running
forward
with
a
rifle
in
his
hand
a
whinny
from
a
horse
told
me
that
somewhere
near
his
beast
was
tied
up
it
was
all
but
dark
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
see
the
lust
of
greed
in
his
eyes
as
he
rushed
to
the
litter
very
softly
i
stole
behind
him
he
tore
off
the
lid
of
the
box
and
pulled
out
the
great
necklace
for
a
second
it
hung
in
his
hands
but
only
for
a
second
so
absorbed
was
he
that
he
did
not
notice
me
standing
full
before
him
nay
he
lifted
his
head
and
gave
me
the
finest
chance
of
my
life
i
was
something
of
a
boxer
and
all
my
accumulated
fury
went
into
the
blow
it
caught
him
on
the
point
of
the
chin
and
his
neck
cricked
like
the
bolt
of
a
rifle
he
fell
limply
on
the
ground
and
the
jewels
dropped
from
his
hand
i
picked
them
up
and
stuffed
them
into
my
breeches
pocket
then
i
pulled
the
pistol
out
of
his
belt
it
was
and
i
knew
that
only
three
had
been
emptied
i
remembered
feeling
extraordinarily
cool
and
composed
and
yet
my
wits
must
have
been
wandering
or
i
would
have
never
taken
the
course
i
did
the
right
thing
to
do
on
arcoll
instructions
was
to
make
for
the
river
and
swim
across
to
my
friends
but
laputa
was
coming
back
and
i
dreaded
meeting
him
laputa
seemed
to
my
heated
fancy
omnipresent
i
thought
of
him
as
covering
the
whole
bank
of
the
river
whereas
i
might
easily
have
crossed
a
little
farther
down
and
made
my
way
up
the
other
bank
to
my
friends
it
was
plain
that
laputa
intended
to
evade
the
patrol
not
to
capture
it
and
there
consequently
i
should
be
safe
the
next
best
thing
was
to
find
arcoll
kaffir
who
was
not
twenty
yards
away
get
some
sort
of
horse
and
break
for
the
bush
long
before
morning
we
should
have
been
over
the
berg
and
in
safety
nay
if
i
wanted
a
mount
there
was
henriques
whinnying
a
few
paces
off
instead
i
did
the
craziest
thing
of
all
with
the
jewels
in
one
pocket
and
the
portugoose
pistol
in
the
other
i
started
running
back
the
road
we
had
come
chapter
xiv
i
carry
the
collar
of
prester
john
i
ran
till
my
breath
grew
short
for
some
kind
of
swift
motion
i
had
to
have
or
choke
the
events
of
the
last
few
minutes
had
inflamed
my
brain
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
had
seen
men
die
by
violence
nay
by
brutal
murder
i
had
put
my
soul
into
the
blow
which
laid
out
henriques
and
i
was
still
hot
with
the
pride
of
it
also
i
had
in
my
pocket
the
fetich
of
the
whole
black
world
i
had
taken
their
ark
of
the
covenant
and
soon
laputa
would
be
on
my
trail
fear
pride
and
a
blind
exultation
all
throbbed
in
my
veins
i
must
have
run
three
miles
before
i
came
to
my
sober
senses
i
put
my
ear
to
the
ground
but
heard
no
sound
of
pursuit
laputa
i
argued
would
have
enough
to
do
for
a
little
shepherding
his
flock
over
the
water
he
might
surround
and
capture
the
patrol
or
he
might
evade
it
the
vow
prevented
him
from
fighting
it
on
the
whole
i
was
clear
that
he
would
ignore
it
and
push
on
for
the
rendezvous
all
this
would
take
time
and
the
business
of
the
priest
would
have
to
wait
when
henriques
came
to
he
would
no
doubt
have
a
story
to
tell
and
the
scouts
would
be
on
my
trail
i
wished
i
had
shot
the
portugoose
while
i
was
at
the
business
it
would
have
been
no
murder
but
a
righteous
execution
meanwhile
i
must
get
off
the
road
the
sand
had
been
disturbed
by
an
army
so
there
was
little
fear
of
my
steps
being
traced
still
it
was
only
wise
to
leave
the
track
which
i
would
be
assumed
to
have
taken
for
laputa
would
guess
i
had
fled
back
the
way
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
i
turned
into
the
bush
which
here
was
thin
and
sparse
like
whins
on
a
common
the
berg
must
be
my
goal
once
on
the
plateau
i
would
be
inside
the
white
man
lines
down
here
in
the
plains
i
was
in
the
country
of
my
enemies
arcoll
meant
to
fight
on
the
uplands
when
it
came
to
fighting
the
black
man
might
rage
as
he
pleased
in
his
own
flats
but
we
stood
to
defend
the
gates
of
the
hills
therefore
over
the
berg
i
must
be
before
morning
or
there
would
be
a
dead
man
with
no
tales
to
tell
i
think
that
even
at
the
start
of
that
night
work
i
realized
the
exceeding
precariousness
of
my
chances
some
twenty
miles
of
bush
and
swamp
separated
me
from
the
foot
of
the
mountains
after
that
there
was
the
climbing
of
them
for
at
the
point
opposite
where
i
now
stood
the
berg
does
not
descend
sharply
on
the
plain
but
is
broken
into
around
the
glens
of
the
klein
letaba
and
the
letsitela
from
the
spot
where
these
rivers
emerge
on
the
flats
to
the
crown
of
the
plateau
is
ten
miles
at
the
shortest
i
had
a
start
of
an
hour
or
so
but
before
dawn
i
had
to
traverse
thirty
miles
of
unknown
and
difficult
country
behind
me
would
follow
the
best
trackers
in
africa
who
knew
every
foot
of
the
wilderness
it
was
a
wild
hazard
but
it
was
my
only
hope
at
this
time
i
was
feeling
pretty
courageous
for
one
thing
i
had
henriques
pistol
close
to
my
leg
and
for
another
i
still
thrilled
with
the
satisfaction
of
having
smitten
his
face
i
took
the
rubies
and
stowed
them
below
my
shirt
and
next
my
skin
i
remember
taking
stock
of
my
equipment
and
laughing
at
the
humour
of
it
one
of
the
heels
was
almost
twisted
off
my
boots
and
my
shirt
and
breeches
were
old
at
the
best
and
ragged
from
hard
usage
the
whole
outfit
would
have
been
dear
at
five
shillings
or
with
the
belt
thrown
in
then
there
was
the
portugoose
pistol
costing
say
a
guinea
and
last
the
prester
collar
worth
several
millions
what
was
more
important
than
my
clothing
was
my
bodily
strength
i
was
still
very
sore
from
the
bonds
and
the
jog
of
that
accursed
horse
but
exercise
was
rapidly
suppling
my
joints
about
five
hours
ago
i
had
eaten
a
filling
though
not
very
sustaining
meal
and
i
thought
i
could
go
on
very
well
till
morning
but
i
was
still
badly
in
arrears
with
my
sleep
and
there
was
no
chance
of
my
snatching
a
minute
till
i
was
over
the
berg
it
was
going
to
be
a
race
against
time
and
i
swore
that
i
would
drive
my
body
to
the
last
ounce
of
strength
moonrise
was
still
an
hour
or
two
away
and
the
sky
was
bright
with
myriad
stars
i
knew
now
what
starlight
meant
for
there
was
ample
light
to
pick
my
way
by
i
steered
by
the
southern
cross
for
i
was
aware
that
the
berg
ran
north
and
south
and
with
that
constellation
on
my
left
hand
i
was
bound
to
reach
it
sooner
or
later
the
bush
closed
around
me
with
its
mysterious
dull
green
shades
and
trees
which
in
the
daytime
were
thin
scrub
now
loomed
like
tall
timber
it
was
very
eerie
moving
a
tiny
fragment
of
mortality
in
that
great
wide
silent
wilderness
with
the
starry
vault
like
an
impassive
celestial
audience
watching
with
many
eyes
they
cheered
me
those
stars
in
my
hurry
and
fear
and
passion
they
spoke
of
the
old
calm
dignities
of
man
i
felt
less
alone
when
i
turned
my
face
to
the
lights
which
were
slanting
alike
on
this
uncanny
bush
and
on
the
homely
streets
of
kirkcaple
the
silence
did
not
last
long
first
came
the
howl
of
a
wolf
to
be
answered
by
others
from
every
quarter
of
the
compass
this
serenade
went
on
for
a
bit
till
the
jackals
chimed
in
with
their
harsh
bark
i
had
been
caught
by
darkness
before
this
when
hunting
on
the
berg
but
i
was
not
afraid
of
wild
beasts
that
is
one
terror
of
the
bush
which
travellers
tales
have
put
too
high
it
was
true
that
i
might
meet
a
hungry
lion
but
the
chance
was
remote
and
i
had
my
pistol
once
indeed
a
huge
animal
bounded
across
the
road
a
little
in
front
of
me
for
a
moment
i
took
him
for
a
lion
but
on
reflection
i
was
inclined
to
think
him
a
very
large
by
this
time
i
was
out
of
the
thickest
bush
and
into
a
piece
of
parkland
with
long
waving
tambuki
grass
which
the
kaffirs
would
burn
later
the
moon
was
coming
up
and
her
faint
rays
silvered
the
flat
tops
of
the
mimosa
trees
i
could
hear
and
feel
around
me
the
rustling
of
animals
once
or
twice
a
big
buck
an
eland
or
a
koodoo
broke
cover
and
at
the
sight
of
me
went
off
snorting
down
the
slope
also
there
were
droves
of
smaller
game
rhebok
and
springbok
and
duikers
which
brushed
past
at
full
gallop
without
even
noticing
me
the
sight
was
so
novel
that
it
set
me
thinking
that
shy
wild
things
should
stampede
like
this
could
only
mean
that
they
had
been
thoroughly
scared
now
obviously
the
thing
that
scared
them
must
be
on
this
side
of
the
letaba
this
must
mean
that
laputa
army
or
a
large
part
of
it
had
not
crossed
at
dupree
drift
but
had
gone
up
the
stream
to
some
higher
ford
if
that
was
so
i
must
alter
my
course
so
i
bore
away
to
the
right
for
a
mile
or
two
making
a
line
due
in
about
an
hour
time
the
ground
descended
steeply
and
i
saw
before
me
the
shining
reaches
of
a
river
i
had
the
chief
features
of
the
countryside
clear
in
my
mind
both
from
old
porings
over
maps
and
from
arcoll
instructions
this
stream
must
be
the
little
letaba
and
i
must
cross
it
if
i
would
get
to
the
mountains
i
remembered
that
majinje
kraal
stood
on
its
left
bank
and
higher
up
in
its
valley
in
the
berg
lived
at
all
costs
the
kraals
must
be
avoided
once
across
it
i
must
make
for
the
letsitela
another
tributary
of
the
great
letaba
and
by
keeping
the
far
bank
of
that
stream
i
should
cross
the
mountains
to
the
place
on
the
plateau
of
the
wood
bush
which
arcoll
had
told
me
would
be
his
headquarters
it
is
easy
to
talk
about
crossing
a
river
and
looking
at
the
slender
streak
on
the
map
i
am
amazed
that
so
small
a
thing
should
have
given
me
such
ugly
tremors
yet
i
have
rarely
faced
a
job
i
liked
so
little
the
stream
ran
yellow
and
sluggish
under
the
clear
moon
on
the
near
side
a
thick
growth
of
bush
clothed
the
bank
but
on
the
far
side
i
made
out
a
swamp
with
tall
bulrushes
the
distance
across
was
no
more
than
fifty
yards
but
i
would
have
swum
a
mile
more
readily
in
deep
water
the
place
stank
of
crocodiles
there
was
no
ripple
to
break
the
oily
flow
except
where
a
derelict
branch
swayed
with
the
current
something
in
the
stillness
the
eerie
light
on
the
water
and
the
rotting
smell
of
the
swamp
made
that
stream
seem
unhallowed
and
deadly
i
sat
down
and
considered
the
matter
crocodiles
had
always
terrified
me
more
than
any
created
thing
and
to
be
dragged
by
iron
jaws
to
death
in
that
hideous
stream
seemed
to
me
the
most
awful
of
endings
yet
cross
it
i
must
if
i
were
to
get
rid
of
my
human
enemies
i
remembered
a
story
of
an
escaped
prisoner
during
the
war
who
had
only
the
komati
river
between
him
and
safety
but
he
dared
not
enter
it
and
was
recaptured
by
a
boer
commando
i
was
determined
that
such
cowardice
should
not
be
laid
to
my
charge
if
i
was
to
die
i
would
at
least
have
given
myself
every
chance
of
life
so
i
braced
myself
as
best
i
could
and
looked
for
a
place
to
enter
the
i
had
mastered
had
taught
me
a
few
things
one
was
that
wild
animals
drink
at
night
and
that
they
have
regular
drinking
places
i
thought
that
the
likeliest
place
for
crocodiles
was
at
or
around
such
spots
and
therefore
i
resolved
to
take
the
water
away
from
a
drinking
place
i
went
up
the
bank
noting
where
the
narrow
emerged
on
the
i
scared
away
several
little
buck
and
once
the
violent
commotion
in
the
bush
showed
that
i
had
frightened
some
bigger
animal
perhaps
a
hartebeest
still
following
the
bank
i
came
to
a
reach
where
the
undergrowth
was
unbroken
and
the
water
looked
deeper
suddenly
i
fear
i
must
use
this
adverb
often
for
all
the
happenings
on
that
night
were
sudden
i
saw
a
biggish
animal
break
through
the
reeds
on
the
far
side
it
entered
the
water
and
whether
wading
or
swimming
i
could
not
see
came
out
a
little
distance
then
some
sense
must
have
told
it
of
my
presence
for
it
turned
and
with
a
grunt
made
its
way
back
i
saw
that
it
was
a
big
and
began
to
think
pig
unlike
other
beasts
drink
not
at
night
but
in
the
daytime
the
hog
had
therefore
not
come
to
drink
but
to
swim
across
now
i
argued
he
would
choose
a
safe
place
for
the
hideous
though
he
is
is
a
wise
beast
what
was
safe
for
him
would
therefore
in
all
likelihood
be
safe
for
me
with
this
hope
to
comfort
me
i
prepared
to
enter
my
first
care
was
the
jewels
so
feeling
them
precarious
in
my
shirt
i
twined
the
collar
round
my
neck
and
clasped
it
the
was
no
flimsy
device
of
modern
jewellery
and
i
had
no
fear
but
that
it
would
hold
i
held
the
pistol
between
my
teeth
and
with
a
prayer
to
god
slipped
into
the
muddy
waters
i
swam
in
the
wild
way
of
a
beginner
who
fears
cramp
the
current
was
light
and
the
water
moderately
warm
but
i
seemed
to
go
very
slowly
and
i
was
cold
with
apprehension
in
the
middle
it
suddenly
shallowed
and
my
breast
came
against
a
mudshoal
i
thought
it
was
a
crocodile
and
in
my
confusion
the
pistol
dropped
from
my
mouth
and
disappeared
i
waded
a
few
steps
and
then
plunged
into
deep
water
again
almost
before
i
knew
i
was
among
the
bulrushes
with
my
feet
in
the
slime
of
the
bank
with
feverish
haste
i
scrambled
through
the
reeds
and
up
through
roots
and
undergrowth
to
the
hard
soil
i
was
across
but
alas
i
had
lost
my
only
weapon
the
swim
and
the
anxiety
had
tired
me
considerably
and
though
it
meant
delay
i
did
not
dare
to
continue
with
the
weight
of
clothes
to
impede
me
i
found
a
dry
sheltered
place
in
the
bush
and
stripped
to
the
skin
i
emptied
my
boots
and
wrung
out
my
shirt
and
breeches
while
the
prester
jewels
were
blazing
on
my
neck
here
was
a
queer
counterpart
to
laputa
in
the
cave
the
change
revived
me
and
i
continued
my
way
in
better
form
so
far
there
had
been
no
sign
of
pursuit
before
me
the
letsitela
was
the
only
other
stream
and
from
what
i
remembered
of
its
character
near
the
berg
i
thought
i
should
have
little
trouble
it
was
smaller
than
the
klein
letaba
and
a
rushing
torrent
where
shallows
must
be
common
i
kept
running
till
i
felt
my
shirt
getting
dry
on
my
back
then
i
restored
the
jewels
to
their
old
home
and
found
their
cool
touch
on
my
breast
very
comforting
the
country
was
getting
more
broken
as
i
advanced
little
kopjes
with
thickets
of
wild
bananas
took
the
place
of
the
dead
levels
long
before
i
reached
the
letsitela
i
saw
that
i
was
right
in
my
guess
it
ran
a
brawling
mountain
stream
in
a
narrow
rift
in
the
bush
i
crossed
it
almost
on
the
boulders
above
a
little
fall
stopping
for
a
moment
to
drink
and
lave
my
brow
after
that
the
country
changed
again
the
wood
was
now
getting
like
that
which
clothed
the
sides
of
the
berg
there
were
tall
yellowwood
sneezewood
essenwood
stinkwood
and
the
ground
was
carpeted
with
thick
grass
and
ferns
the
sight
gave
me
my
first
earnest
of
safety
i
was
approaching
my
own
country
behind
me
was
heathendom
and
the
black
fever
flats
in
front
were
the
cool
mountains
and
bright
streams
and
the
guns
of
my
own
folk
as
i
struggled
on
for
i
was
getting
very
footsore
and
weary
i
became
aware
of
an
odd
sound
in
my
rear
it
was
as
if
something
were
following
me
i
stopped
and
listened
with
a
sudden
dread
could
laputa
trackers
have
got
up
with
me
already
but
the
sound
was
not
of
human
feet
it
was
as
if
some
heavy
animal
were
plunging
through
the
undergrowth
at
intervals
came
the
soft
pad
of
its
feet
on
the
grass
it
must
be
the
hungry
lion
of
my
nightmare
and
henriques
pistol
was
in
the
mud
of
the
klein
letaba
the
only
thing
was
a
tree
and
i
had
sprung
for
one
and
scrambled
wearily
into
the
first
branches
when
a
great
yellow
animal
came
into
the
moonlight
providence
had
done
kindly
in
robbing
me
of
my
pistol
the
next
minute
i
was
on
the
ground
with
colin
leaping
on
me
and
baying
with
joy
i
hugged
that
blessed
hound
and
buried
my
head
in
his
shaggy
neck
sobbing
like
a
child
how
he
had
traced
me
i
can
never
tell
the
secret
belongs
only
to
the
maker
of
good
and
faithful
dogs
with
him
by
my
side
i
was
a
new
man
the
awesome
loneliness
had
gone
i
felt
as
if
he
were
a
message
from
my
own
people
to
take
me
safely
home
he
clearly
knew
the
business
afoot
for
he
padded
beside
me
with
never
a
glance
to
right
or
left
another
time
he
would
have
been
snowking
in
every
thicket
but
now
he
was
on
duty
a
serious
conscientious
dog
with
no
eye
but
for
business
the
moon
went
down
and
the
starry
sky
was
our
only
light
the
thick
gloom
which
brooded
over
the
landscape
pointed
to
the
night
being
far
gone
i
thought
i
saw
a
deeper
blackness
ahead
which
might
be
the
line
of
the
berg
then
came
that
period
of
utter
stillness
when
every
bush
sound
is
hushed
and
the
world
seems
to
swoon
i
felt
almost
impious
hurrying
through
that
profound
silence
when
not
even
the
leaves
stirred
or
a
frog
croaked
suddenly
as
we
came
over
a
rise
a
little
wind
blew
on
the
back
of
my
head
and
a
bitter
chill
came
into
the
air
i
knew
from
nights
spent
in
the
open
that
it
was
the
precursor
of
dawn
sure
enough
as
i
glanced
back
far
over
the
plain
a
pale
glow
was
stealing
upwards
into
the
sky
in
a
few
minutes
the
pall
melted
into
an
airy
haze
and
above
me
i
saw
the
heavens
shot
with
tremors
of
blue
light
then
the
foreground
began
to
clear
and
there
before
me
with
their
heads
still
muffled
in
vapour
were
the
mountains
xenophon
ten
thousand
did
not
hail
the
sea
more
gladly
than
i
welcomed
those
frowning
ramparts
of
the
berg
once
again
my
weariness
was
eased
i
cried
to
colin
and
together
we
ran
down
into
the
wide
shallow
trough
which
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
as
the
sun
rose
above
the
horizon
the
black
masses
changed
to
emerald
and
rich
umber
and
the
fleecy
mists
of
the
summits
opened
and
revealed
beyond
shining
spaces
of
green
some
lines
of
shakespeare
ran
in
my
head
which
i
have
always
thought
the
most
beautiful
of
all
poetry
candles
are
burned
out
and
jocund
day
walks
tiptoe
on
the
misty
mountain
tops
up
there
among
the
clouds
was
my
salvation
like
the
psalmist
i
lifted
my
eyes
to
the
hills
from
whence
came
my
aid
hope
is
a
wonderful
restorative
to
be
near
the
hills
to
smell
their
odours
to
see
at
the
head
of
the
glens
the
lines
of
the
plateau
where
were
white
men
and
civilization
all
gave
me
new
life
and
courage
colin
saw
my
mood
and
spared
a
moment
now
and
then
to
inspect
a
hole
or
a
covert
down
in
the
shallow
trough
i
saw
the
links
of
a
burn
the
machudi
which
flowed
down
the
glen
it
was
my
purpose
to
ascend
away
to
the
north
in
the
direction
of
majinje
were
patches
of
kaffir
tillage
and
i
thought
i
discerned
the
smoke
from
fires
womankind
would
be
cooking
their
morning
meal
to
the
south
ran
a
thick
patch
of
forest
but
i
saw
beyond
it
the
spur
of
the
mountain
over
which
runs
the
highroad
to
wesselsburg
the
clear
air
of
dawn
was
like
wine
in
my
blood
i
was
not
free
but
i
was
on
the
threshold
of
freedom
if
i
could
only
reach
my
friends
with
the
prester
collar
in
my
shirt
i
would
have
performed
a
feat
which
would
never
be
forgotten
i
would
have
made
history
by
my
glorious
folly
breakfastless
and
footsore
i
was
yet
a
proud
man
as
i
crossed
the
hollow
to
the
mouth
of
machudi
glen
my
chickens
had
been
counted
too
soon
and
there
was
to
be
no
hatching
colin
grew
uneasy
and
began
to
sniff
up
wind
i
was
maybe
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
glen
foot
plodding
through
the
long
grass
of
the
hollow
when
the
behaviour
of
the
dog
made
me
stop
and
listen
in
that
still
air
sounds
carry
far
and
i
seemed
to
hear
the
noise
of
feet
brushing
through
cover
the
noise
came
both
from
north
and
south
from
the
forest
and
from
the
lower
course
of
the
machudi
i
dropped
into
shelter
and
running
with
bent
back
got
to
the
summit
of
a
little
knoll
it
was
colin
who
first
caught
sight
of
my
pursuers
he
was
staring
at
a
rift
in
the
trees
and
suddenly
gave
a
short
bark
i
looked
and
saw
two
men
running
hard
cross
the
grass
and
dip
into
the
bed
of
the
stream
a
moment
later
i
had
a
glimpse
of
figures
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
moving
fast
to
the
mouth
of
the
glen
the
pursuit
had
not
followed
me
it
had
waited
to
cut
me
off
fool
that
i
was
i
had
forgotten
the
wonders
of
kaffir
telegraphy
it
had
been
easy
for
laputa
to
send
word
thirty
miles
ahead
to
stop
any
white
man
who
tried
to
cross
the
berg
and
then
i
knew
that
i
was
very
weary
chapter
xv
morning
in
the
berg
i
was
perhaps
half
a
mile
the
nearer
to
the
glen
and
was
likely
to
get
there
first
and
after
that
i
could
see
the
track
winding
by
the
waterside
and
then
crossing
a
which
diverted
the
stream
it
was
a
road
a
man
could
scarcely
ride
and
a
tired
man
would
have
a
hard
job
to
climb
i
do
not
think
that
i
had
any
hope
my
exhilaration
had
died
as
suddenly
as
it
had
been
born
i
saw
myself
caught
and
carried
off
to
laputa
who
must
now
be
close
on
the
rendezvous
at
inanda
kraal
i
had
no
weapon
to
make
a
fight
for
it
my
foemen
were
many
and
untired
it
must
be
only
a
matter
of
minutes
till
i
was
in
their
hands
more
in
a
dogged
fury
of
disappointment
than
with
any
hope
of
escape
i
forced
my
sore
legs
up
the
glen
ten
minutes
ago
i
had
been
exulting
in
the
glories
of
the
morning
and
now
the
sun
was
not
less
bright
or
the
colours
less
fair
but
the
heart
had
gone
out
of
the
spectator
at
first
i
managed
to
get
some
pace
out
of
myself
partly
from
fear
and
partly
from
anger
but
i
soon
found
that
my
body
had
been
tried
too
far
i
could
plod
along
but
to
save
my
life
i
could
not
have
hurried
any
healthy
savage
could
have
caught
me
in
a
hundred
yards
the
track
i
remember
was
overhung
with
creepers
and
often
i
had
to
squeeze
through
thickets
of
countless
little
brooks
ran
down
from
the
hillside
threads
of
silver
among
the
green
pastures
soon
i
left
the
stream
and
climbed
up
on
the
shoulder
where
the
road
was
not
much
better
than
a
precipice
every
step
was
a
weariness
i
could
hardly
drag
one
foot
after
the
other
and
my
heart
was
beating
like
the
fanners
of
a
mill
i
had
spasms
of
acute
sickness
and
it
took
all
my
resolution
to
keep
me
from
lying
down
by
the
roadside
at
last
i
was
at
the
top
of
the
shoulder
and
could
look
back
there
was
no
sign
of
anybody
on
the
road
so
far
as
i
could
see
could
i
have
escaped
them
i
had
been
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
for
the
first
part
and
they
might
have
lost
sight
of
me
and
concluded
that
i
had
avoided
the
glen
or
tried
one
of
the
faces
before
me
i
remember
there
stretched
the
upper
glen
a
green
hollow
with
the
sides
scarred
by
ravines
there
was
a
high
waterfall
in
one
of
them
which
was
white
as
snow
against
the
red
rocks
my
wits
must
have
been
shaky
for
i
took
the
fall
for
a
snowdrift
and
wondered
sillily
why
the
berg
had
grown
so
alpine
a
faint
spasm
of
hope
took
me
into
that
green
cup
the
bracken
was
as
thick
as
on
the
pentlands
and
there
was
a
multitude
of
small
lovely
flowers
in
the
grass
it
was
like
a
at
home
such
a
place
as
i
had
often
in
boyhood
searched
for
and
eggs
birds
were
crying
round
me
as
i
broke
this
solitude
and
one
small
buck
a
klipspringer
rose
from
my
feet
and
dashed
up
one
of
the
gullies
before
me
was
a
steep
green
wall
with
the
sky
blue
above
it
beyond
it
was
safety
but
as
my
eyes
looked
at
it
i
knew
that
i
could
never
reach
it
then
i
saw
my
pursuers
high
up
on
the
left
side
and
rounding
the
rim
of
the
cup
were
little
black
figures
they
had
not
followed
my
trail
but
certain
of
my
purpose
had
gone
forward
to
intercept
me
i
remember
feeling
a
puny
weakling
compared
with
those
lusty
natives
who
could
make
such
good
going
on
steep
mountains
they
were
certainly
no
men
of
the
plains
but
hillmen
probably
some
remnants
of
old
tribe
who
still
squatted
in
the
glen
machudi
was
a
blackguard
chief
whom
the
boers
long
ago
smashed
in
one
of
their
native
wars
he
was
a
fierce
old
warrior
and
had
put
up
a
good
fight
to
the
last
till
a
hired
impi
of
swazis
had
surrounded
his
in
the
forest
and
destroyed
him
a
boer
farmer
on
the
plateau
had
his
skull
and
used
to
drink
whisky
out
of
it
when
he
was
merry
the
sight
of
the
pursuit
was
the
last
straw
i
gave
up
hope
and
my
intentions
were
narrowed
to
one
frantic
desire
to
hide
the
jewels
patriotism
which
i
had
almost
forgotten
flickered
up
in
that
crisis
at
any
rate
laputa
should
not
have
the
snake
if
he
drove
out
the
white
man
he
should
not
clasp
the
prester
rubies
on
his
great
neck
there
was
no
cover
in
the
green
cup
so
i
turned
up
the
ravine
on
the
right
side
the
enemy
so
far
as
i
could
judge
were
on
the
left
and
in
front
and
in
the
gully
i
might
find
a
to
bury
the
necklet
in
only
a
desperate
resolution
took
me
through
the
tangle
of
juniper
bushes
into
the
red
screes
of
the
gully
at
first
i
could
not
find
what
i
sought
the
stream
in
the
ravine
slid
down
a
long
slope
like
a
and
the
sides
were
bare
and
stony
still
i
plodded
on
helping
myself
with
a
hand
on
colin
back
for
my
legs
were
numb
with
fatigue
the
gully
narrowed
and
i
came
to
a
flat
place
with
a
long
pool
beyond
was
a
little
fall
and
up
this
i
climbed
into
a
network
of
tiny
cascades
over
one
pool
hung
a
dead
and
a
bay
from
it
ran
into
a
hole
of
the
rock
i
slipped
the
jewels
far
into
the
hole
where
they
lay
on
the
firm
sand
showing
odd
lights
through
the
dim
blue
water
then
i
scrambled
down
again
to
the
flat
space
and
the
pool
and
looked
round
to
see
if
any
one
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
ravine
there
was
no
sign
as
yet
of
the
pursuit
so
i
dropped
limply
on
the
shingle
and
waited
for
i
had
suddenly
conceived
a
plan
as
my
breath
came
back
to
me
my
wits
came
back
from
their
wandering
these
men
were
not
there
to
kill
me
but
to
capture
me
they
could
know
nothing
of
the
jewels
for
laputa
would
never
have
dared
to
make
the
loss
of
the
sacred
snake
public
therefore
they
would
not
suspect
what
i
had
done
and
would
simply
lead
me
to
laputa
at
inanda
kraal
i
began
to
see
the
glimmerings
of
a
plan
for
saving
my
life
and
by
god
grace
for
saving
my
country
from
the
horrors
of
rebellion
the
more
i
thought
the
better
i
liked
it
it
demanded
a
bold
front
and
it
might
well
miscarry
but
i
had
taken
such
desperate
hazards
during
the
past
days
that
i
was
less
afraid
of
fortune
anyhow
the
choice
lay
between
certain
death
and
a
slender
chance
of
life
and
it
was
easy
to
decide
playing
football
i
used
to
notice
how
towards
the
end
of
a
game
i
might
be
sore
and
weary
without
a
kick
in
my
body
but
when
i
had
a
straight
job
of
tackling
a
man
my
strength
miraculously
returned
it
was
even
so
now
i
lay
on
my
side
luxuriating
in
being
still
and
slowly
a
sort
of
vigour
crept
back
into
my
limbs
perhaps
a
of
rest
was
given
me
before
on
the
lip
of
the
gully
i
saw
figures
appear
looking
down
i
saw
several
men
who
had
come
across
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
scrambling
up
the
stream
i
got
to
my
feet
with
colin
bristling
beside
me
and
awaited
them
with
the
stiffest
face
i
could
muster
as
i
expected
they
were
machudi
men
i
recognized
them
by
the
red
ochre
in
their
hair
and
their
necklets
big
fellows
they
were
and
deep
in
the
chest
the
true
breed
of
mountaineers
i
admired
their
light
tread
on
the
slippery
rock
it
was
hopeless
to
think
of
evading
such
men
in
their
own
hills
the
men
from
the
side
joined
the
men
in
front
and
they
stood
looking
at
me
from
about
twelve
yards
off
they
were
armed
only
with
knobkerries
and
very
clearly
were
no
part
of
laputa
army
this
made
their
errand
plain
to
me
i
said
in
kaffir
as
one
of
them
made
a
hesitating
step
to
advance
are
you
and
what
do
you
seek
there
was
no
answer
but
they
looked
at
me
curiously
then
one
made
a
motion
with
his
stick
colin
gave
a
growl
and
would
have
been
on
him
if
i
had
not
kept
a
hand
on
his
collar
the
rash
man
drew
back
and
all
stood
stiff
and
perplexed
your
hands
by
your
side
i
said
the
dog
who
has
a
devil
will
devour
you
one
of
you
speak
for
the
rest
and
tell
me
your
purpose
for
a
moment
i
had
a
wild
notion
that
they
might
be
friends
some
of
arcoll
scouts
and
out
to
help
me
but
the
first
words
shattered
the
fancy
are
sent
by
inkulu
the
biggest
of
them
said
bade
us
bring
you
to
him
what
if
i
refuse
to
go
baas
we
must
take
you
to
him
we
are
under
the
vow
of
the
snake
of
fiddlestick
i
cried
do
you
think
is
the
bigger
chief
the
inkulu
or
ratitswan
i
tell
you
ratitswan
is
now
driving
inkulu
before
him
as
a
wind
drives
rotten
leaves
it
will
be
well
for
you
men
of
machudi
to
make
peace
with
ratitswan
and
take
me
to
him
on
the
berg
if
you
bring
me
to
him
i
and
he
will
reward
you
but
if
you
do
inkulu
bidding
you
will
soon
be
hunted
like
buck
out
of
your
hills
they
grinned
at
one
another
but
i
could
see
that
my
words
had
no
effect
laputa
had
done
his
business
too
well
the
spokesman
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
the
way
the
kaffirs
have
wish
you
no
ill
baas
but
we
have
been
bidden
to
take
you
to
inkulu
we
can
not
disobey
the
command
of
the
snake
my
weakness
was
coming
on
me
again
and
i
could
talk
no
more
i
sat
down
plump
on
the
ground
almost
falling
into
the
pool
me
to
inkulu
i
stammered
with
a
dry
throat
do
not
fear
him
and
i
rolled
on
my
back
these
clansmen
of
machudi
were
decent
fellows
one
of
them
had
some
kaffir
beer
in
a
calabash
which
he
gave
me
to
drink
the
stuff
was
thin
and
sickly
but
the
fermentation
in
it
did
me
good
i
had
the
sense
to
remember
my
need
of
sleep
day
is
young
i
said
i
have
come
far
i
ask
to
be
allowed
to
sleep
for
an
hour
the
men
made
no
difficulty
and
with
my
head
between
colin
paws
i
slipped
into
dreamless
slumber
when
they
wakened
me
the
sun
was
beginning
to
climb
the
sky
i
judged
it
to
be
about
eight
they
had
made
a
little
fire
and
roasted
mealies
some
of
the
food
they
gave
me
and
i
ate
it
thankfully
i
was
feeling
better
and
i
think
a
pipe
would
have
almost
completed
my
cure
but
when
i
stood
up
i
found
that
i
was
worse
than
i
had
thought
the
truth
is
i
was
which
you
often
see
in
horses
but
rarely
in
men
what
the
proper
explanation
is
i
do
not
know
but
the
muscles
simply
refuse
to
answer
the
direction
of
the
will
i
found
my
legs
sprawling
like
a
child
who
is
learning
to
walk
you
want
me
to
go
to
the
inkulu
you
must
carry
me
i
said
as
i
dropped
once
more
on
the
ground
the
men
nodded
and
set
to
work
to
make
a
kind
of
litter
out
of
their
knobkerries
and
some
old
ropes
they
carried
as
they
worked
and
chattered
i
looked
idly
at
the
left
bank
of
the
ravine
that
is
the
left
as
you
ascend
it
some
of
machudi
men
had
come
down
there
and
though
the
place
looked
sheer
and
perilous
i
saw
how
they
had
managed
it
i
followed
out
bit
by
bit
the
track
upwards
not
with
any
thought
of
escape
but
merely
to
keep
my
mind
under
control
the
right
road
was
from
the
foot
of
the
pool
up
a
long
shelf
to
a
clump
of
juniper
then
there
was
an
easy
chimney
then
a
piece
of
good
climbing
and
last
another
ledge
which
led
by
an
easy
gradient
to
the
top
i
figured
all
this
out
as
i
have
heard
a
condemned
man
will
count
the
windows
of
the
houses
on
his
way
to
the
scaffold
presently
the
litter
was
ready
and
the
men
made
signs
to
me
to
get
into
it
they
carried
me
down
the
ravine
and
up
the
machudi
burn
to
the
green
walls
at
its
head
i
admired
their
bodily
fitness
for
they
bore
me
up
those
steep
slopes
with
never
a
halt
zigzagging
in
the
proper
style
of
mountain
transport
in
less
than
an
hour
we
had
topped
the
ridge
and
the
plateau
was
before
me
it
looked
very
homelike
and
gracious
rolling
in
gentle
undulations
to
the
western
horizon
with
clumps
of
wood
in
its
hollows
far
away
i
saw
smoke
rising
from
what
should
be
the
village
of
the
iron
kranz
it
was
the
country
of
my
own
people
and
my
captors
behoved
to
go
cautiously
they
were
old
hands
at
and
it
was
wonderful
the
way
in
which
they
kept
out
of
sight
even
on
the
bare
ridges
arcoll
could
have
taught
them
nothing
in
the
art
of
scouting
at
an
incredible
pace
they
hurried
me
along
now
in
a
meadow
by
a
stream
side
now
through
a
patch
of
forest
and
now
skirting
a
green
shoulder
of
hill
once
they
clapped
down
suddenly
and
crawled
into
the
lee
of
some
thick
bracken
then
very
quietly
they
tied
my
hands
and
feet
and
not
urgently
wound
a
dirty
length
of
cotton
over
my
mouth
colin
was
meantime
held
tight
and
muzzled
with
a
kind
of
bag
strapped
over
his
head
to
get
this
over
his
snapping
jaws
took
the
whole
strength
of
the
party
i
guessed
that
we
were
nearing
the
highroad
which
runs
from
the
plateau
down
the
great
letaba
valley
to
the
mining
township
of
wesselsburg
away
out
on
the
plain
the
police
patrols
must
be
on
this
road
and
there
was
risk
in
crossing
sure
enough
i
seemed
to
catch
a
jingle
of
bridles
as
if
from
some
company
of
men
riding
in
haste
we
lay
still
for
a
little
till
the
scouts
came
back
and
reported
the
coast
clear
then
we
made
a
dart
for
the
road
crossed
it
and
got
into
cover
on
the
other
side
where
the
ground
sloped
down
to
the
letaba
glen
i
noticed
in
crossing
that
the
dust
of
the
highway
was
thick
with
the
marks
of
shod
horses
i
was
very
near
and
yet
very
far
from
my
own
people
once
in
the
rocky
gorge
of
the
letaba
we
advanced
with
less
care
we
scrambled
up
a
steep
side
gorge
and
came
on
to
the
small
plateau
from
which
the
cloud
mountains
rise
after
that
i
was
so
tired
that
i
drowsed
away
heedless
of
the
bumping
of
the
litter
we
went
up
and
up
and
when
i
next
opened
my
eyes
we
had
gone
through
a
pass
into
a
hollow
of
the
hills
there
was
a
flat
space
a
mile
or
two
square
and
all
round
it
stern
black
ramparts
of
rock
this
must
be
kraal
a
strong
place
if
ever
one
existed
for
a
few
men
could
defend
all
the
approaches
considering
that
i
had
warned
arcoll
of
this
rendezvous
i
marvelled
that
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
hold
the
entrance
the
place
was
impregnable
unless
guns
were
brought
up
to
the
heights
i
remember
thinking
of
a
story
i
had
heard
how
in
the
war
beyers
took
his
guns
into
the
wolkberg
and
thereby
saved
them
from
our
troops
could
arcoll
be
meditating
the
same
exploit
suddenly
i
heard
the
sound
of
loud
voices
and
my
litter
was
dropped
roughly
on
the
ground
i
woke
to
clear
consciousness
in
the
midst
of
pandemonium
chapter
xvi
inanda
kraal
the
vow
was
at
an
end
in
place
of
the
silent
army
of
yesterday
a
mob
of
maddened
savages
surged
around
me
they
were
chanting
a
wild
song
and
brandishing
spears
and
rifles
to
its
accompaniment
from
their
bloodshot
eyes
stared
the
lust
of
blood
the
fury
of
conquest
and
all
the
aboriginal
passions
on
which
laputa
had
laid
his
spell
in
my
mind
ran
a
fragment
from
laputa
prayer
in
the
cave
about
the
ones
machudi
men
stout
fellows
they
held
their
ground
as
long
as
they
could
were
swept
out
of
the
way
and
the
wave
of
black
savagery
seemed
to
close
over
my
head
i
thought
my
last
moment
had
come
certainly
it
had
but
for
colin
the
bag
had
been
taken
from
his
head
and
the
fellow
of
machudi
had
dropped
the
rope
round
his
collar
in
a
red
fury
of
wrath
the
dog
leaped
at
my
enemies
though
every
man
of
them
was
fully
armed
they
fell
back
for
i
have
noticed
always
that
kaffirs
are
mortally
afraid
of
a
white
man
dog
colin
had
the
sense
to
keep
beside
me
growling
like
a
thunderstorm
he
held
the
ring
around
my
litter
the
breathing
space
would
not
have
lasted
long
but
it
gave
me
time
to
get
to
my
feet
my
wrists
and
feet
had
been
unbound
long
before
and
the
rest
had
cured
my
i
stood
up
in
that
fierce
circle
with
the
clear
knowledge
that
my
life
hung
by
a
hair
me
to
inkulu
i
cried
and
fools
would
you
despise
his
orders
if
one
hair
of
my
head
is
hurt
he
will
flay
you
alive
show
me
the
way
to
him
and
clear
out
of
it
i
dare
say
there
was
a
break
in
my
voice
for
i
was
dismally
frightened
but
there
must
have
been
sufficient
authority
to
get
me
a
hearing
machudi
men
closed
up
behind
me
and
repeated
my
words
with
flourishes
and
gestures
but
still
the
circle
held
no
man
came
nearer
me
but
none
moved
so
as
to
give
me
passage
then
i
screwed
up
my
courage
and
did
the
only
thing
possible
i
walked
straight
into
the
circle
knowing
well
that
i
was
running
no
light
risk
my
courage
as
i
have
already
explained
is
of
little
use
unless
i
am
doing
something
i
could
not
endure
another
minute
of
sitting
still
with
those
fierce
eyes
on
me
the
circle
gave
way
sullenly
they
made
a
road
for
me
closing
up
behind
on
my
guards
so
that
machudi
men
were
swallowed
in
the
mob
alone
i
stalked
forward
with
all
that
huge
yelling
crowd
behind
me
i
had
not
far
to
go
inanda
kraal
was
a
cluster
of
kyas
and
rondavels
shaped
in
a
with
a
flat
space
between
the
houses
where
grew
a
big
merula
tree
all
around
was
a
medley
of
little
fires
with
men
squatted
beside
them
here
and
there
a
party
had
finished
their
meal
and
were
swaggering
about
with
a
great
shouting
the
mob
into
which
i
had
fallen
was
of
this
sort
and
i
saw
others
within
the
confines
of
the
camp
but
around
the
merula
tree
there
was
a
gathering
of
chiefs
if
i
could
judge
by
the
comparative
quiet
and
dignity
of
the
men
who
sat
in
rows
on
the
ground
a
few
were
standing
and
among
them
i
caught
sight
of
laputa
tall
figure
i
strode
towards
it
wondering
if
the
chiefs
would
let
me
pass
the
hubbub
of
my
volunteer
attendants
brought
the
eyes
of
the
company
round
to
me
in
a
second
it
seemed
every
man
was
on
his
feet
i
could
only
pray
that
laputa
would
get
to
me
before
his
friends
had
time
to
spear
me
i
remember
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
a
spur
of
hill
beyond
the
kraal
and
walked
on
with
the
best
resolution
i
could
find
already
i
felt
in
my
breast
some
of
the
long
thin
assegais
of
umbooni
men
but
laputa
did
not
intend
that
i
should
be
butchered
a
word
from
him
brought
his
company
into
order
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
facing
him
where
he
stood
in
front
of
the
biggest
kya
with
henriques
beside
him
and
some
of
the
northern
indunas
henriques
looked
ghastly
in
the
clear
morning
light
and
he
had
a
linen
rag
bound
round
his
head
and
jaw
as
if
he
suffered
from
toothache
his
face
was
more
livid
his
eyes
more
bloodshot
and
at
the
sight
of
me
his
hand
went
to
his
belt
and
his
teeth
snapped
but
he
held
his
peace
and
it
was
laputa
who
spoke
he
looked
straight
through
me
and
addressed
machudi
men
have
brought
back
the
prisoner
that
is
well
and
your
service
will
be
remembered
go
to
camp
on
the
hill
there
and
you
will
be
given
food
the
men
departed
and
with
them
fell
away
the
crowd
which
had
followed
me
i
was
left
very
giddy
and
dazed
to
confront
laputa
and
his
chiefs
the
whole
scene
was
swimming
before
my
eyes
i
remember
there
was
a
clucking
of
hens
from
somewhere
behind
the
kraal
which
called
up
ridiculous
memories
i
was
trying
to
remember
the
plan
i
had
made
in
machudi
glen
i
kept
saying
to
myself
like
a
parrot
army
can
not
know
about
the
jewels
laputa
must
keep
his
loss
secret
i
can
get
my
life
from
him
if
i
offer
to
give
them
back
it
had
sounded
a
good
scheme
three
hours
before
but
with
the
man
hard
face
before
me
it
seemed
a
frail
peg
to
hang
my
fate
on
laputa
eye
fell
on
me
a
clear
searching
eye
with
a
question
in
it
there
was
something
he
was
trying
to
say
to
me
which
he
dared
not
put
into
words
i
guessed
what
the
something
was
for
i
saw
his
glance
run
over
my
shirt
and
my
empty
pockets
have
made
little
of
your
treachery
he
said
did
you
think
to
escape
me
i
could
bring
you
back
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
was
no
treachery
i
replied
you
blame
a
prisoner
for
trying
to
escape
when
shooting
began
i
found
myself
free
and
i
took
the
road
for
home
ask
machudi
men
and
they
will
tell
you
that
i
came
quietly
with
them
when
i
saw
that
the
game
was
up
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
matters
very
little
what
you
did
you
are
here
tie
him
up
and
put
him
in
my
kya
he
said
to
the
bodyguard
have
something
to
say
to
him
before
he
dies
as
the
men
laid
hands
on
me
i
saw
the
exultant
grin
on
face
it
was
more
than
i
could
endure
i
said
talk
of
traitors
mr
laputa
there
is
the
biggest
and
blackest
at
your
elbow
that
man
sent
word
to
arcoll
about
your
crossing
at
dupree
drift
at
our
outspan
at
noon
yesterday
he
came
to
me
and
offered
me
my
liberty
if
i
would
help
him
he
told
me
he
was
a
spy
and
i
flung
his
offer
in
his
face
it
was
he
who
shot
the
keeper
by
the
river
side
and
would
have
stolen
the
snake
if
i
had
not
broken
his
head
you
call
me
a
traitor
and
you
let
that
thing
live
though
he
has
killed
your
priest
and
betrayed
your
plans
kill
me
if
you
like
but
by
god
let
him
die
first
i
do
not
know
how
the
others
took
the
revelation
for
my
eyes
were
only
for
the
portugoose
he
made
a
step
towards
me
his
hands
twitching
by
his
sides
lie
he
screamed
in
that
queer
broken
voice
which
much
fever
gives
was
this
english
hound
that
killed
the
keeper
and
felled
me
when
i
tried
to
save
him
the
man
who
insults
my
honour
is
dead
and
he
plucked
from
his
belt
a
pistol
a
good
shot
does
not
miss
at
two
yards
i
was
never
nearer
my
end
than
in
that
fraction
of
time
while
the
weapon
came
up
to
the
aim
it
was
scarcely
a
second
but
it
was
enough
for
colin
the
dog
had
kept
my
side
and
had
stood
docilely
by
me
while
laputa
spoke
the
truth
is
he
must
have
been
as
tired
as
i
was
as
the
kaffirs
approached
to
lay
hands
on
me
he
had
growled
menacingly
but
when
i
spoke
again
he
had
stopped
henriques
voice
had
convinced
him
of
a
more
urgent
danger
and
so
soon
as
the
trigger
hand
of
the
portugoose
rose
the
dog
sprang
the
bullet
went
wide
and
the
next
moment
dog
and
man
were
struggling
on
the
ground
a
dozen
hands
held
me
from
going
to
colin
aid
but
oddly
enough
no
one
stepped
forward
to
help
henriques
the
ruffian
kept
his
head
and
though
the
dog
teeth
were
in
his
shoulder
he
managed
to
get
his
right
hand
free
i
saw
what
would
happen
and
yelled
madly
in
my
apprehension
the
yellow
wrist
curved
and
the
pistol
barrel
was
pressed
below
the
dog
shoulder
thrice
he
fired
the
grip
relaxed
and
colin
rolled
over
limply
fragments
of
shirt
still
hanging
from
his
jaw
the
portugoose
rose
slowly
with
his
hand
to
his
head
and
a
thin
stream
of
blood
dripping
from
his
shoulder
as
i
saw
the
faithful
eyes
glazing
in
death
and
knew
that
i
had
lost
the
best
of
all
comrades
i
went
clean
berserk
mad
the
cluster
of
men
round
me
who
had
been
staring
at
the
fight
were
swept
aside
like
reeds
i
went
straight
for
the
portugoose
determined
that
pistol
or
no
pistol
i
would
serve
him
as
he
had
served
my
dog
for
my
years
i
was
a
lad
long
in
the
arms
and
deep
in
the
chest
but
i
had
not
yet
come
to
my
full
strength
and
in
any
case
i
could
not
hope
to
fight
the
whole
of
laputa
army
i
was
flung
back
and
forwards
like
a
shuttlecock
they
played
some
kind
of
game
with
me
and
i
could
hear
the
idiotic
kaffir
laughter
it
was
blind
buff
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
for
i
was
blind
with
fury
i
struck
out
wildly
left
and
right
beating
the
air
often
but
sometimes
getting
in
a
solid
blow
on
hard
black
flesh
i
was
soundly
beaten
myself
pricked
with
spears
and
made
to
caper
for
savage
sport
suddenly
i
saw
laputa
before
me
and
hurled
myself
madly
at
his
chest
some
one
gave
me
a
clout
on
the
head
and
my
senses
fled
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
lying
on
a
heap
of
in
a
dark
room
i
had
a
desperate
headache
and
a
horrid
nausea
which
made
me
fall
back
as
soon
as
i
tried
to
raise
myself
a
voice
came
out
of
the
darkness
as
i
stirred
a
voice
speaking
english
you
awake
mr
storekeeper
the
voice
was
laputa
but
i
could
not
see
him
the
room
was
pitch
dark
except
for
a
long
ray
of
sunlight
on
the
floor
awake
i
said
do
you
want
with
me
some
one
stepped
out
of
the
gloom
and
sat
down
near
me
a
naked
black
foot
broke
the
belt
of
light
on
the
floor
god
sake
get
me
a
drink
i
murmured
the
figure
rose
and
fetched
a
pannikin
of
water
from
a
pail
i
could
hear
the
cool
trickle
of
the
drops
on
the
metal
a
hand
put
the
dish
to
my
mouth
and
i
drank
water
with
a
strong
dash
of
spirits
this
brought
back
my
nausea
and
i
collapsed
on
the
till
the
fit
passed
again
the
voice
spoke
this
time
from
close
at
hand
are
paying
the
penalty
of
being
a
fool
mr
storekeeper
you
are
young
to
die
but
folly
is
common
in
youth
in
an
hour
you
will
regret
that
you
did
not
listen
to
my
advice
at
umvelos
i
clawed
at
my
wits
and
strove
to
realize
what
he
was
saying
he
spoke
of
death
within
an
hour
if
it
only
came
sharp
and
sudden
i
did
not
mind
greatly
the
plan
i
had
made
had
slipped
utterly
out
of
my
mind
my
body
was
so
wretched
that
i
asked
only
for
rest
i
was
very
lighthearted
and
foolish
at
that
moment
me
if
you
like
i
whispered
day
you
will
pay
dearly
for
it
all
but
for
god
sake
go
away
and
leave
me
alone
laputa
laughed
it
was
a
horrid
sound
in
the
darkness
are
brave
mr
storekeeper
but
i
have
seen
a
brave
man
courage
ebb
very
fast
when
he
saw
the
death
which
i
have
arranged
for
you
would
you
like
to
hear
something
of
it
by
way
of
preparation
in
a
low
gentle
voice
he
began
to
tell
me
mysteries
of
awful
cruelty
at
first
i
scarcely
heard
him
but
as
he
went
on
my
brain
seemed
to
wake
from
its
lethargy
i
listened
with
freezing
blood
not
in
my
wildest
nightmares
had
i
imagined
such
a
fate
then
in
despite
of
myself
a
cry
broke
from
me
interests
you
laputa
asked
could
tell
you
more
but
something
must
be
left
to
the
fancy
yours
should
be
an
active
one
and
his
hand
gripped
my
shaking
wrist
and
felt
my
pulse
will
see
that
the
truth
does
not
fall
short
of
my
forecast
he
went
on
i
have
appointed
henriques
your
executioner
the
name
brought
my
senses
back
to
me
me
i
said
for
god
sake
kill
henriques
too
if
you
did
justice
you
would
let
me
go
and
roast
the
portugoose
alive
but
for
me
the
snake
would
be
over
the
lebombo
by
this
time
in
henriques
pocket
it
is
not
my
friend
it
was
stolen
by
a
storekeeper
who
will
shortly
be
wishing
he
had
died
in
his
mother
womb
my
plan
was
slowly
coming
back
to
me
you
value
prester
john
collar
you
will
save
my
life
what
will
your
rising
be
without
the
snake
would
they
follow
you
a
yard
if
they
suspected
you
had
lost
it
you
would
threaten
me
laputa
said
very
gently
then
in
a
burst
of
wrath
he
shouted
will
follow
me
to
hell
for
my
own
sake
imbecile
do
you
think
my
power
is
built
on
a
trinket
when
you
are
in
your
grave
i
will
be
ruling
a
hundred
millions
from
the
proudest
throne
on
earth
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
pulled
back
a
shutter
of
the
window
letting
a
flood
of
light
into
the
hut
in
that
light
i
saw
that
he
had
in
his
hands
the
ivory
box
which
had
contained
the
collar
will
carry
the
casket
through
the
wars
he
cried
if
i
choose
never
to
open
it
who
will
gainsay
me
you
besotted
fool
to
think
that
any
theft
of
yours
could
hinder
my
destiny
he
was
the
blustering
savage
again
and
i
preferred
him
in
the
part
all
that
he
said
might
be
true
but
i
thought
i
could
detect
in
his
voice
a
keen
regret
and
in
his
air
a
touch
of
disquiet
the
man
was
a
fanatic
and
like
all
fanatics
had
his
superstitions
i
said
when
you
mount
the
throne
you
speak
of
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
have
the
rubies
on
your
neck
after
all
your
talk
in
the
cave
i
thought
he
would
have
throttled
me
he
glowered
down
at
me
with
murder
in
his
eyes
then
he
dashed
the
casket
on
the
floor
with
such
violence
that
it
broke
into
fragments
me
back
the
he
cried
like
a
petted
child
me
back
the
collar
of
john
this
was
the
moment
i
had
been
waiting
for
see
here
mr
laputa
i
said
am
going
to
talk
business
before
you
started
this
rising
you
were
a
civilized
man
with
a
good
education
well
just
remember
that
education
for
a
minute
and
look
at
the
matter
in
a
sensible
light
i
not
like
the
portugoose
i
do
want
to
steal
your
rubies
i
swear
to
god
that
what
i
have
told
you
is
true
henriques
killed
the
priest
and
would
have
bagged
the
jewels
if
i
had
not
laid
him
out
i
ran
away
because
i
was
going
to
be
killed
and
i
took
the
collar
to
keep
it
out
of
hands
i
tell
you
i
would
never
have
shot
the
old
man
myself
very
well
what
happened
your
men
overtook
me
and
i
had
no
choice
but
to
surrender
before
they
reached
me
i
hid
the
collar
in
a
place
i
know
of
now
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
fair
and
square
business
proposition
you
may
be
able
to
get
on
without
the
snake
but
i
can
see
you
want
it
back
i
am
in
a
tight
place
and
want
nothing
so
much
as
my
life
i
offer
to
trade
with
you
give
me
my
life
and
i
will
take
you
to
the
place
and
put
the
jewels
in
your
hand
otherwise
you
may
kill
me
but
you
will
never
see
the
collar
of
john
again
i
still
think
that
was
a
pretty
bold
speech
for
a
man
to
make
in
a
predicament
like
mine
but
it
had
its
effect
laputa
ceased
to
be
the
barbarian
king
and
talked
like
a
civilized
man
is
as
you
call
it
a
business
proposition
but
supposing
i
refuse
it
supposing
i
take
measures
here
in
this
kraal
to
make
you
speak
and
then
send
for
the
jewels
are
several
objections
i
said
quite
cheerfully
for
i
felt
that
i
was
gaining
ground
is
that
i
could
not
explain
to
any
mortal
soul
how
to
find
the
collar
i
know
where
it
is
but
i
could
not
impart
the
knowledge
another
is
that
the
country
between
here
and
machudi
is
not
very
healthy
for
your
people
arcoll
men
are
all
over
it
and
you
can
not
have
a
collection
of
search
parties
rummaging
about
in
the
glen
for
long
last
and
most
important
if
you
send
any
one
for
the
jewels
you
confess
their
loss
no
mr
laputa
if
you
want
them
back
you
must
go
yourself
and
take
me
with
you
he
stood
silent
for
a
little
with
his
brows
knit
in
thought
then
he
opened
the
door
and
went
out
i
guessed
that
he
had
gone
to
discover
from
his
scouts
the
state
of
the
country
between
inanda
kraal
and
machudi
glen
hope
had
come
back
to
me
and
i
sat
among
the
trying
to
plan
the
future
if
he
made
a
bargain
i
believed
he
would
keep
it
once
set
free
at
the
head
of
machudi
i
should
be
within
an
hour
or
two
of
arcoll
posts
so
far
i
had
done
nothing
for
the
cause
my
message
had
been
made
useless
by
treachery
and
i
had
stolen
the
snake
only
to
restore
it
but
if
i
got
off
with
my
life
there
would
be
work
for
me
to
do
in
the
armageddon
which
i
saw
approaching
should
i
escape
i
wondered
what
would
hinder
laputa
from
setting
his
men
to
follow
me
and
seize
me
before
i
could
get
into
safety
my
only
chance
was
that
arcoll
might
have
been
busy
this
day
and
the
countryside
too
full
of
his
men
to
let
kaffirs
through
but
if
this
was
so
laputa
and
i
should
be
stopped
and
then
laputa
would
certainly
kill
me
i
wished
and
yet
i
did
not
wish
that
arcoll
should
hold
all
approaches
as
i
reflected
my
first
exhilaration
died
away
the
scales
were
still
heavily
weighted
against
me
laputa
returned
closing
the
door
behind
him
will
bargain
with
you
on
my
own
terms
you
shall
have
your
life
and
in
return
you
will
take
me
to
the
place
where
you
hid
the
collar
and
put
it
into
my
hands
i
will
ride
there
and
you
will
run
beside
me
tied
to
my
saddle
if
we
are
in
danger
from
the
white
men
i
will
shoot
you
dead
do
you
accept
i
said
scrambling
to
my
feet
and
ruefully
testing
my
shaky
legs
if
you
want
me
to
get
to
machudi
you
must
go
slowly
for
i
am
nearly
foundered
then
he
brought
out
a
bible
and
made
me
swear
on
it
that
i
would
do
as
i
promised
to
me
in
turn
i
said
you
will
give
me
my
life
if
i
restore
the
jewels
he
swore
kissing
the
book
like
a
witness
in
a
i
had
forgotten
that
the
man
called
himself
a
christian
thing
more
i
ask
i
said
want
my
dog
decently
buried
has
been
already
done
was
the
reply
was
a
brave
animal
and
my
people
honour
bravery
chapter
xvii
a
deal
and
its
consequences
my
eyes
were
bandaged
tight
and
a
thong
was
run
round
my
right
wrist
and
tied
to
laputa
i
felt
the
glare
of
the
afternoon
sun
on
my
head
and
my
shins
were
continually
barked
by
stones
and
trees
but
these
were
my
only
tidings
of
the
outer
world
by
the
sound
of
his
paces
laputa
was
riding
the
and
if
any
one
thinks
it
easy
to
go
blindfold
by
a
horse
side
i
hope
he
will
soon
have
the
experience
in
the
darkness
i
could
not
tell
the
speed
of
the
beast
when
i
ran
i
overshot
it
and
was
tugged
back
when
i
walked
my
wrist
was
dislocated
with
the
tugs
forward
for
an
hour
or
more
i
suffered
this
breakneck
treatment
we
were
descending
often
i
could
hear
the
noise
of
falling
streams
and
once
we
splashed
through
a
mountain
ford
laputa
was
taking
no
risks
for
he
clearly
had
in
mind
the
possibility
of
some
accident
which
would
set
me
free
and
he
had
no
desire
to
have
me
guiding
arcoll
to
his
camp
but
as
i
stumbled
and
sprawled
down
these
rocky
tracks
i
was
not
thinking
of
laputa
plans
my
whole
soul
was
filled
with
regret
for
colin
and
rage
against
his
murderer
after
my
first
mad
rush
i
had
not
thought
about
my
dog
he
was
dead
but
so
would
i
be
in
an
hour
or
two
and
there
was
no
cause
to
lament
him
but
at
the
first
revival
of
hope
my
grief
had
returned
as
they
bandaged
my
eyes
i
was
wishing
that
they
would
let
me
see
his
grave
as
i
followed
beside
laputa
i
told
myself
that
if
ever
i
got
free
when
the
war
was
over
i
would
go
to
inanda
kraal
find
the
grave
and
put
a
tombstone
over
it
in
memory
of
the
dog
that
saved
my
life
i
would
also
write
that
the
man
who
shot
him
was
killed
on
such
and
such
a
day
at
such
and
such
a
place
by
colin
master
i
wondered
why
laputa
had
not
the
wits
to
see
the
portugoose
treachery
and
to
let
me
fight
him
i
did
not
care
what
were
the
weapons
knives
or
guns
or
naked
fists
i
would
certainly
kill
him
and
afterwards
the
kaffirs
could
do
as
they
pleased
with
me
hot
tears
of
rage
and
weakness
wet
the
bandage
on
my
eyes
and
the
sobs
which
came
from
me
were
not
only
those
of
weariness
at
last
we
halted
laputa
got
down
and
took
off
the
bandage
and
i
found
myself
in
one
of
the
which
lie
among
the
foothills
of
the
wolkberg
the
glare
blinded
me
and
for
a
little
i
could
only
see
the
marigolds
growing
at
my
feet
then
i
had
a
glimpse
of
the
deep
gorge
of
the
great
letaba
below
me
and
far
to
the
east
the
flats
running
out
to
the
hazy
blue
line
of
the
lebombo
hills
laputa
let
me
sit
on
the
ground
for
a
minute
or
two
to
get
my
breath
and
rest
my
feet
was
a
rough
road
he
said
can
take
it
easier
now
for
i
have
no
wish
to
carry
you
he
patted
the
and
the
beautiful
creature
turned
his
mild
eyes
on
the
pair
of
us
i
wondered
if
he
recognized
his
rider
of
two
nights
ago
i
had
seen
laputa
as
the
christian
minister
as
the
priest
and
king
in
the
cave
as
the
leader
of
an
army
at
dupree
drift
and
at
the
kraal
we
had
left
as
the
savage
with
all
flung
to
the
winds
i
was
to
see
this
amazing
man
in
a
further
part
for
he
now
became
a
friendly
and
rational
companion
he
kept
his
horse
at
an
easy
walk
and
talked
to
me
as
if
we
were
two
friends
out
for
a
trip
together
perhaps
he
had
talked
thus
to
arcoll
the
who
drove
his
the
wooded
bluff
above
machudi
glen
showed
far
in
front
he
told
me
the
story
of
the
machudi
war
which
i
knew
already
but
he
told
it
as
a
saga
there
had
been
a
stratagem
by
which
one
of
the
boer
leaders
a
grobelaar
i
think
got
some
of
his
men
into
the
enemy
camp
by
hiding
them
in
a
captured
forage
wagon
the
trojan
horse
i
said
involuntarily
said
my
companion
same
old
device
and
to
my
amazement
he
quoted
some
lines
of
virgil
you
understand
latin
he
asked
i
told
him
that
i
had
some
slight
knowledge
of
the
tongue
acquired
at
the
university
of
edinburgh
laputa
nodded
he
mentioned
the
name
of
a
professor
there
and
commented
on
his
scholarship
man
i
cried
in
god
name
are
you
doing
in
this
business
you
that
are
educated
and
have
seen
the
world
what
makes
you
try
to
put
the
clock
back
you
want
to
wipe
out
the
civilization
of
a
thousand
years
and
turn
us
all
into
savages
it
the
more
shame
to
you
when
you
know
better
misunderstand
me
he
said
quietly
is
because
i
have
sucked
civilization
dry
that
i
know
the
bitterness
of
the
fruit
i
want
a
simpler
and
better
world
and
i
want
that
world
for
my
own
people
i
am
a
christian
and
will
you
tell
me
that
your
civilization
pays
much
attention
to
christ
you
call
yourself
a
patriot
will
you
not
give
me
leave
to
be
a
patriot
in
turn
you
are
a
christian
what
sort
of
christianity
is
it
to
deluge
the
land
with
blood
best
he
said
house
must
be
swept
and
garnished
before
the
man
of
the
house
can
dwell
in
it
you
have
read
history
such
a
purging
has
descended
on
the
church
at
many
times
and
the
world
has
awakened
to
a
new
hope
it
is
the
same
in
all
religions
the
temples
grow
tawdry
and
foul
and
must
be
cleansed
and
let
me
remind
you
the
cleanser
has
always
come
out
of
the
desert
i
had
no
answer
being
too
weak
and
forlorn
to
think
but
i
fastened
on
his
patriotic
plea
are
the
patriots
in
your
following
they
are
all
red
kaffirs
crying
for
blood
and
plunder
supposing
you
were
oliver
cromwell
you
could
make
nothing
out
of
such
a
crew
are
my
people
he
said
simply
by
this
time
we
had
forded
the
great
letaba
and
were
making
our
way
through
the
clumps
of
forest
to
the
crown
of
the
plateau
i
noticed
that
laputa
kept
well
in
cover
preferring
the
tangle
of
wooded
undergrowth
to
the
open
spaces
of
the
as
he
talked
his
wary
eyes
were
keeping
a
sharp
over
the
landscape
i
thrilled
with
the
thought
that
my
own
folk
were
near
at
hand
once
laputa
checked
me
with
his
hand
as
i
was
going
to
speak
and
in
silence
we
crossed
the
kloof
of
a
little
stream
after
that
we
struck
a
long
strip
of
forest
and
he
slackened
his
watch
you
fight
for
a
great
cause
i
said
do
you
let
a
miscreant
like
henriques
have
a
hand
in
it
you
must
know
that
the
man
only
interest
in
you
is
the
chance
of
loot
i
am
for
you
against
henriques
and
i
tell
you
plain
that
if
you
do
break
the
snake
back
it
will
sting
you
laputa
looked
at
me
with
an
odd
meditative
look
misunderstand
again
mr
storekeeper
the
portuguese
is
what
you
call
a
mean
white
his
only
safety
is
among
us
i
am
campaigner
enough
to
know
that
an
enemy
who
has
a
burning
grievance
against
my
other
enemies
is
a
good
ally
you
are
too
hard
on
henriques
you
and
your
friends
have
treated
him
as
a
kaffir
and
a
kaffir
he
is
in
everything
but
kaffir
virtues
what
makes
you
so
anxious
that
henriques
should
not
betray
me
not
a
mean
white
i
said
i
will
speak
the
truth
i
hope
in
god
name
to
see
you
smashed
but
i
want
it
done
by
honest
men
and
not
by
a
yellow
devil
who
has
murdered
my
dog
and
my
friends
sooner
or
later
you
will
find
him
out
and
if
he
escapes
you
and
there
any
justice
in
heaven
he
wo
escape
me
words
said
laputa
with
a
laugh
and
then
in
one
second
he
became
rigid
in
the
saddle
we
had
crossed
a
patch
of
meadow
and
entered
a
wood
beyond
which
ran
the
highway
i
fancy
he
was
out
in
his
reckoning
and
did
not
think
the
road
so
near
at
any
rate
after
a
moment
he
caught
the
sound
of
horses
and
i
caught
it
too
the
wood
was
thin
and
there
was
no
room
for
retreat
while
to
recross
the
meadow
would
bring
us
clean
into
the
open
he
jumped
from
his
horse
untied
with
amazing
quickness
the
rope
halter
from
its
neck
and
started
to
gag
me
by
winding
the
thing
round
my
jaw
i
had
no
time
to
protest
that
i
would
keep
faith
and
my
right
hand
was
tethered
to
his
pommel
in
the
grip
of
these
great
arms
i
was
helpless
and
in
a
trice
was
standing
dumb
as
a
while
laputa
his
left
arm
round
both
of
mine
and
his
right
hand
over
the
eyes
strained
his
ears
like
a
sable
antelope
who
has
scented
danger
there
was
never
a
more
brutal
gagging
the
rope
crushed
my
nose
and
drove
my
lips
down
on
my
teeth
besides
gripping
my
throat
so
that
i
could
scarcely
breathe
the
pain
was
so
great
that
i
became
sick
and
would
have
fallen
but
for
laputa
happily
i
managed
to
get
my
teeth
apart
so
that
one
coil
slipped
between
and
eased
the
pain
of
the
jaws
but
the
rest
was
bad
enough
to
make
me
bite
frantically
on
the
tow
and
i
think
in
a
little
my
sharp
front
teeth
would
have
severed
it
all
this
discomfort
prevented
me
seeing
what
happened
the
wood
as
i
have
said
was
thin
and
through
the
screen
of
leaves
i
had
a
confused
impression
of
men
and
horses
passing
interminably
there
can
only
have
been
a
score
at
the
most
but
the
moments
drag
if
a
cord
is
gripping
your
throat
when
laputa
at
length
untied
me
i
had
another
fit
of
nausea
and
leaned
helplessly
against
a
tree
laputa
listened
till
the
sound
of
the
horses
had
died
away
then
silently
we
stole
to
the
edge
of
the
road
across
and
into
the
thicker
evergreen
bush
on
the
far
side
at
a
pace
which
forced
me
to
run
hard
we
climbed
a
steepish
slope
till
ahead
of
us
we
saw
the
bald
green
crown
of
the
meadowlands
i
noticed
that
his
face
had
grown
dark
and
sullen
again
he
was
in
an
enemy
country
and
had
the
air
of
the
hunted
instead
of
the
hunter
when
i
stopped
he
glowered
at
me
and
once
when
i
was
all
but
overcome
with
fatigue
he
lifted
his
hand
in
a
threat
had
he
carried
a
sjambok
it
would
have
fallen
on
my
back
if
he
was
nervous
so
was
i
the
fact
that
i
was
out
of
the
kaffir
country
and
in
the
land
of
my
own
folk
was
a
kind
of
qualified
liberty
at
any
moment
i
felt
providence
might
intervene
to
set
me
free
it
was
in
the
bond
that
laputa
should
shoot
me
if
we
were
attacked
but
a
pistol
might
miss
as
far
as
my
shaken
wits
would
let
me
i
began
to
forecast
the
future
once
he
got
the
jewels
my
side
of
the
bargain
was
complete
he
had
promised
me
my
life
but
there
had
been
nothing
said
about
my
liberty
and
i
felt
assured
that
laputa
would
never
allow
one
who
had
seen
so
much
to
get
off
to
arcoll
with
his
tidings
but
back
to
that
unhallowed
kraal
i
was
resolved
i
would
not
go
he
was
armed
and
i
was
helpless
he
was
strong
and
i
was
dizzy
with
weakness
he
was
mounted
and
i
was
on
foot
it
seemed
a
poor
hope
that
i
should
get
away
there
was
little
chance
from
a
wandering
patrol
for
i
knew
if
we
were
followed
i
should
have
a
bullet
in
my
head
while
laputa
got
off
on
the
i
must
wait
and
bide
events
at
the
worst
a
clean
shot
on
the
hillside
in
a
race
for
life
was
better
than
the
unknown
mysteries
of
the
kraal
i
prayed
earnestly
to
god
to
show
me
his
mercy
for
if
ever
man
was
sore
bested
by
the
heathen
it
was
i
to
my
surprise
laputa
chose
to
show
himself
on
the
green
he
looked
towards
the
wolkberg
and
raised
his
hands
it
must
have
been
some
signal
i
cast
my
eyes
back
on
the
road
we
had
come
and
i
thought
i
saw
some
figures
a
mile
back
on
the
edge
of
the
letaba
gorge
he
was
making
sure
of
my
return
by
this
time
it
was
about
four
in
the
afternoon
and
as
heavenly
weather
as
the
heart
of
man
could
wish
the
meadows
were
full
of
aromatic
herbs
which
as
we
crushed
them
sent
up
a
delicate
odour
the
little
pools
and
shallows
of
the
burns
were
as
clear
as
a
lothian
we
were
now
going
at
a
good
pace
and
i
found
that
my
earlier
weariness
was
growing
less
i
was
being
keyed
up
for
some
great
crisis
for
in
my
case
the
spirit
acts
direct
on
the
body
and
fatigue
grows
and
ebbs
with
hope
i
knew
that
my
strength
was
not
far
from
but
i
knew
also
that
so
long
as
a
chance
was
left
me
i
should
have
enough
for
a
stroke
before
i
realized
where
we
were
we
had
rounded
the
hill
and
were
looking
down
on
the
green
cup
of
the
upper
machudi
glen
far
down
i
remember
where
the
trees
began
there
was
a
cloud
of
smoke
some
kaffir
or
maybe
arcoll
had
fired
the
forest
the
smoke
was
drifting
away
under
a
light
west
wind
over
the
far
plains
so
that
they
were
seen
through
a
haze
of
opal
laputa
bade
me
take
the
lead
i
saw
quite
clear
the
red
kloof
on
the
far
side
where
the
collar
was
hid
to
get
there
we
might
have
ridden
straight
into
the
cup
but
a
providential
instinct
made
me
circle
round
the
top
till
we
were
on
the
lip
of
the
ravine
this
was
the
road
some
of
machudi
men
had
taken
and
unthinkingly
i
followed
them
twenty
minutes
riding
brought
us
to
the
place
and
all
the
while
i
had
no
kind
of
plan
of
escape
i
was
in
the
hands
of
my
maker
watching
like
the
jews
of
old
for
a
sign
laputa
dismounted
and
looked
down
into
the
gorge
is
no
road
there
i
said
must
go
down
to
the
foot
and
come
up
the
it
would
be
better
to
leave
your
horse
here
he
started
down
the
cliff
which
from
above
looks
a
sheer
precipice
then
he
seemed
to
agree
with
me
took
the
rope
from
the
neck
and
his
beast
and
at
that
moment
i
had
an
inspiration
with
my
in
his
hand
he
preceded
me
down
the
hill
till
we
got
to
the
red
screes
at
the
foot
of
the
kloof
then
under
my
guidance
we
turned
up
into
the
darkness
of
the
gorge
as
we
entered
i
looked
back
and
saw
figures
coming
over
the
edge
of
the
green
cup
laputa
men
i
guessed
what
i
had
to
do
must
be
done
quickly
we
climbed
up
the
burn
over
the
succession
of
little
cataracts
till
we
came
to
the
flat
space
of
shingle
and
the
long
pool
where
i
had
been
taken
that
morning
the
ashes
of
the
fire
which
machudi
men
had
made
were
plain
on
the
rock
after
that
i
had
to
climb
a
waterfall
to
get
to
the
rocky
pool
where
i
had
bestowed
the
rubies
must
take
off
this
thong
i
said
must
climb
to
get
the
collar
cover
me
with
a
pistol
if
you
like
i
wo
be
out
of
sight
laputa
undid
the
thong
and
set
me
free
from
his
belt
he
took
a
pistol
cocked
it
and
held
it
over
his
left
hand
i
had
seen
this
way
of
shooting
adopted
by
indifferent
shots
and
it
gave
me
a
wild
hope
that
he
might
not
be
much
of
a
marksman
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
find
the
pool
close
against
the
blackened
stump
of
a
i
thrust
in
my
hand
and
gathered
up
the
jewels
from
the
cool
sand
they
came
out
glowing
like
living
fires
and
for
a
moment
i
thrilled
with
a
sense
of
reverence
surely
these
were
no
common
stones
which
held
in
them
the
very
heart
of
hell
clutching
them
tightly
i
climbed
down
to
laputa
at
the
sight
of
the
great
snake
he
gave
a
cry
of
rapture
tearing
it
from
me
he
held
it
at
arm
length
his
face
lit
with
a
passionate
joy
he
kissed
it
he
raised
it
to
the
sky
nay
he
was
on
his
knees
before
it
once
more
he
was
the
savage
transported
in
the
presence
of
his
fetich
he
turned
to
me
with
burning
eyes
on
your
knees
he
cried
reverence
the
down
you
impious
dog
and
seek
pardon
for
your
sacrilege
wo
i
said
wo
bow
to
any
heathen
idol
he
pointed
his
pistol
at
me
a
second
i
shoot
where
your
head
is
now
down
you
fool
or
perish
promised
me
my
life
i
said
stubbornly
though
heaven
knows
why
i
chose
to
act
thus
he
dropped
the
pistol
and
flung
himself
on
me
i
was
helpless
as
a
baby
in
his
hands
he
forced
me
to
the
ground
and
rolled
my
face
in
the
sand
then
he
pulled
me
to
my
feet
and
tossed
me
backward
till
i
almost
staggered
into
the
pool
i
saved
myself
and
staggered
instead
into
the
shallow
at
the
foot
of
it
close
under
the
ledge
of
the
precipice
that
morning
when
machudi
men
were
cooking
breakfast
i
had
figured
out
a
route
up
the
cliff
this
route
was
now
my
hope
of
escape
laputa
had
dropped
his
pistol
and
the
collar
had
plunged
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
worship
now
if
ever
was
my
time
i
must
get
on
the
shelf
which
ran
sideways
up
the
cliff
and
then
scramble
for
dear
life
i
pretended
to
be
dazed
and
terrified
promised
me
my
life
i
whimpered
life
he
cried
you
shall
have
your
life
and
before
long
you
will
pray
for
death
i
saved
the
collar
i
pleaded
would
have
stolen
it
i
brought
it
safe
here
and
now
you
have
got
it
meantime
i
was
pulling
myself
up
on
the
shelf
and
loosening
with
one
hand
a
boulder
which
overhung
the
pool
have
been
repaid
he
said
savagely
will
not
die
my
life
is
no
use
without
liberty
i
said
working
at
the
boulder
till
it
lay
loose
in
its
niche
he
did
not
answer
being
intent
on
examining
the
collar
to
see
if
it
had
suffered
any
harm
hope
it
is
scratched
i
said
trod
on
it
when
i
hit
him
laputa
peered
at
the
gems
like
a
mother
at
a
child
who
has
had
a
fall
i
saw
my
chance
and
took
it
with
a
great
heave
i
pulled
the
boulder
down
into
the
pool
it
made
a
prodigious
splash
sending
a
shower
of
spray
over
laputa
and
the
collar
in
cover
of
it
i
raced
up
the
shelf
straining
for
the
shelter
of
the
juniper
tree
a
shot
rang
out
and
struck
the
rock
above
me
a
second
later
i
had
reached
the
tree
and
was
scrambling
up
the
crack
beyond
it
laputa
did
not
fire
again
he
may
have
distrusted
his
shooting
or
seen
a
better
way
of
it
he
dashed
through
the
stream
and
ran
up
the
shelf
like
a
klipspringer
after
me
i
felt
rather
than
saw
what
was
happening
and
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
gathered
my
dregs
of
energy
for
the
last
struggle
you
know
the
nightmare
when
you
are
pursued
by
some
awful
terror
and
though
sick
with
fear
your
legs
have
a
strange
numbness
and
you
can
not
drag
them
in
obedience
to
the
will
such
was
my
feeling
in
the
crack
above
the
juniper
tree
in
truth
i
had
passed
the
bounds
of
my
endurance
last
night
i
had
walked
fifty
miles
and
all
day
i
had
borne
the
torments
of
a
dreadful
suspense
i
had
been
bound
and
gagged
and
beaten
till
the
force
was
out
of
my
limbs
also
and
above
all
i
had
had
little
food
and
i
was
dizzy
with
want
of
sleep
my
feet
seemed
leaden
my
hands
had
no
more
grip
than
putty
i
do
not
know
how
i
escaped
falling
into
the
pool
for
my
head
was
singing
and
my
heart
thumping
in
my
throat
i
seemed
to
feel
laputa
great
hand
every
second
clawing
at
my
heels
i
had
reason
for
my
fears
he
had
entered
the
crack
long
before
i
had
reached
the
top
and
his
progress
was
twice
as
fast
as
mine
when
i
emerged
on
the
topmost
shelf
he
was
scarcely
a
yard
behind
me
but
an
overhang
checked
his
bulky
figure
and
gave
me
a
few
seconds
grace
i
needed
it
all
for
these
last
steps
on
the
shelf
were
the
totterings
of
an
old
man
only
a
desperate
resolution
and
an
extreme
terror
made
me
drag
one
foot
after
the
other
blindly
i
staggered
on
to
the
top
of
the
ravine
and
saw
before
me
the
grazing
in
the
light
of
the
westering
sun
i
forced
myself
into
a
sort
of
drunken
run
and
crawled
into
the
saddle
behind
me
as
i
turned
i
could
see
laputa
shoulders
rising
over
the
edge
i
had
no
knife
to
cut
the
and
the
horse
could
not
stir
then
the
miracle
happened
when
the
rope
had
gagged
me
my
teeth
must
have
nearly
severed
it
at
one
place
and
this
laputa
had
not
noticed
when
he
used
it
as
a
the
shock
of
my
entering
the
saddle
made
the
fling
up
his
head
violently
and
the
rope
snapped
i
could
not
find
the
stirrups
but
i
dug
my
heels
into
his
sides
and
he
leaped
forward
at
the
same
moment
laputa
began
to
shoot
it
was
a
foolish
move
for
he
might
have
caught
me
by
running
since
i
had
neither
spurs
nor
whip
and
the
horse
was
hampered
by
the
loose
end
of
rope
at
his
knee
in
any
case
being
an
indifferent
shot
he
should
have
aimed
at
the
not
at
me
but
i
suppose
he
wished
to
save
his
charger
one
bullet
sang
past
my
head
a
second
did
my
business
for
me
it
passed
over
my
shoulder
as
i
lay
low
in
the
saddle
and
grazed
the
right
ear
the
pain
maddened
him
and
and
all
he
plunged
into
a
wild
gallop
other
shots
came
but
they
fell
far
short
i
saw
dimly
a
native
or
two
the
men
who
had
followed
us
rush
to
intercept
me
and
i
think
a
spear
was
flung
but
in
a
flash
we
were
past
them
and
their
cries
faded
behind
me
i
found
the
bridle
reached
for
the
stirrups
and
galloped
straight
for
the
sunset
and
for
freedom
chapter
xviii
how
a
man
may
sometimes
put
his
trust
in
a
horse
i
had
long
passed
the
limit
of
my
strength
only
constant
fear
and
wild
alternations
of
hope
had
kept
me
going
so
long
and
now
that
i
was
safe
i
became
in
earnest
the
wonder
is
that
i
did
not
fall
off
happily
the
horse
was
good
and
the
ground
easy
for
i
was
powerless
to
do
any
guiding
i
simply
sat
on
his
back
in
a
silly
glow
of
comfort
keeping
a
line
for
the
dying
sun
which
i
saw
in
a
nick
of
the
iron
crown
mountain
a
sort
of
childish
happiness
possessed
me
after
three
days
of
imminent
peril
to
be
free
was
to
be
in
fairyland
to
be
swishing
through
the
long
bracken
or
plunging
among
the
flowers
of
the
meadowlands
in
a
world
of
essential
lights
and
fragrances
seemed
scarcely
part
of
mortal
experience
remember
that
i
was
little
more
than
a
lad
and
that
i
had
faced
death
so
often
of
late
that
my
mind
was
all
adrift
to
be
able
to
hope
once
more
nay
to
be
allowed
to
cease
both
from
hope
and
fear
was
like
a
deep
and
happy
opiate
to
my
senses
spent
and
frail
as
i
was
my
soul
swam
in
blessed
waters
of
ease
the
mood
did
not
last
long
i
came
back
to
earth
with
a
shock
as
the
stumbled
at
the
crossing
of
a
stream
i
saw
that
the
darkness
was
fast
falling
and
with
the
sight
panic
returned
to
me
behind
me
i
seemed
to
hear
the
sound
of
pursuit
the
noise
was
in
my
ears
but
when
i
turned
it
ceased
and
i
saw
only
the
dusky
shoulders
of
hills
i
tried
to
remember
what
arcoll
had
told
me
about
his
headquarters
but
my
memory
was
wiped
clean
i
thought
they
were
on
or
near
the
highway
but
i
could
not
remember
where
the
highway
was
besides
he
was
close
to
the
enemy
and
i
wanted
to
get
back
into
the
towns
far
away
from
the
if
i
rode
west
i
must
come
in
time
to
villages
where
i
could
hide
myself
these
were
unworthy
thoughts
but
my
excuse
must
be
my
tattered
nerves
when
a
man
comes
out
of
great
danger
he
is
apt
to
be
a
little
deaf
to
the
call
of
duty
suddenly
i
became
ashamed
god
had
preserved
me
from
deadly
perils
but
not
that
i
might
cower
in
some
shelter
i
had
a
mission
as
clear
as
laputa
for
the
first
time
i
became
conscious
to
what
a
little
thing
i
owed
my
salvation
that
matter
of
the
broken
halter
was
like
the
finger
of
divine
providence
i
had
been
saved
for
a
purpose
and
unless
i
fulfilled
that
purpose
i
should
again
be
lost
i
was
always
a
fatalist
and
in
that
hour
of
strained
body
and
soul
i
became
something
of
a
mystic
my
panic
ceased
my
lethargy
departed
and
a
more
manly
resolution
took
their
place
i
gripped
the
by
the
head
and
turned
him
due
left
now
i
remembered
where
the
highroad
ran
and
i
remembered
something
else
for
it
was
borne
in
on
me
that
laputa
had
fallen
into
my
hands
without
any
subtle
purpose
i
had
played
a
master
game
he
was
cut
off
from
his
people
without
a
horse
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
highroad
which
arcoll
men
patrolled
without
him
the
rising
would
crumble
there
might
be
war
even
desperate
war
but
we
should
fight
against
a
leaderless
foe
if
he
could
only
be
shepherded
to
the
north
his
game
was
over
and
at
our
leisure
we
could
mop
up
the
scattered
concentrations
i
was
now
as
eager
to
get
back
into
danger
as
i
had
been
to
get
into
safety
arcoll
must
be
found
and
warned
and
that
at
once
or
laputa
would
slip
over
to
inanda
kraal
under
cover
of
dark
it
was
a
matter
of
minutes
and
on
these
minutes
depended
the
lives
of
thousands
it
was
also
a
matter
of
ebbing
strength
for
with
my
return
to
common
sense
i
saw
very
clearly
how
near
my
capital
was
spent
if
i
could
reach
the
highroad
find
arcoll
or
arcoll
men
and
give
them
my
news
i
would
do
my
countrymen
a
service
such
as
no
man
in
africa
could
render
but
i
felt
my
head
swimming
i
was
swaying
crazily
in
the
saddle
and
my
hands
had
scarcely
the
force
of
a
child
i
could
only
lie
limply
on
the
horse
back
clutching
at
his
mane
with
trembling
fingers
i
remember
that
my
head
was
full
of
a
text
from
the
psalms
about
not
putting
one
trust
in
horses
i
prayed
that
this
one
horse
might
be
an
exception
for
he
carried
more
than
caesar
and
his
fortunes
my
mind
is
a
blank
about
those
last
minutes
in
less
than
an
hour
after
my
escape
i
struck
the
highway
but
it
was
an
hour
which
in
the
retrospect
unrolls
itself
into
unquiet
years
i
was
dimly
conscious
of
scrambling
through
a
ditch
and
coming
to
a
ghostly
white
road
the
swung
to
the
right
and
the
next
i
knew
some
one
had
taken
my
bridle
and
was
speaking
to
me
at
first
i
thought
it
was
laputa
and
screamed
then
i
must
have
tottered
in
the
saddle
for
i
felt
an
arm
slip
round
my
middle
the
rider
uncorked
a
bottle
with
his
teeth
and
forced
some
brandy
down
my
throat
i
choked
and
coughed
and
then
looked
up
to
see
a
white
policeman
staring
at
me
i
knew
the
police
by
the
green
i
managed
to
croak
god
sake
take
me
to
arcoll
the
man
whistled
shrilly
on
his
fingers
and
a
second
rider
came
cantering
down
the
road
as
he
came
up
i
recognized
his
face
but
could
not
put
a
name
to
it
it
the
lad
crawfurd
i
heard
a
voice
say
man
d
no
mind
me
at
lourenco
marques
aitken
the
scotch
tongue
worked
a
spell
with
me
it
cleared
my
wits
and
opened
the
gates
of
my
past
life
at
last
i
knew
i
was
among
my
own
folk
must
see
arcoll
i
have
news
for
him
tremendous
news
o
man
take
me
to
arcoll
and
ask
me
no
questions
where
is
he
where
is
he
it
happens
he
about
two
hundred
yards
off
aitken
said
light
ye
see
at
the
top
of
the
brae
is
his
camp
they
helped
me
up
the
road
a
man
on
each
side
of
me
for
i
could
never
have
kept
in
the
saddle
without
their
support
my
message
to
arcoll
kept
humming
in
my
head
as
i
tried
to
put
it
into
words
for
i
had
a
horrid
fear
that
my
wits
would
fail
me
and
i
should
be
dumb
when
the
time
came
also
i
was
in
a
fever
of
haste
every
minute
i
wasted
increased
laputa
chance
of
getting
back
to
the
kraal
he
had
men
with
him
every
bit
as
skilful
as
arcoll
trackers
unless
arcoll
had
a
big
force
and
the
best
horses
there
was
no
hope
often
in
looking
back
at
this
hour
i
have
marvelled
at
the
strangeness
of
my
behaviour
here
was
i
just
set
free
from
the
certainty
of
a
hideous
death
and
yet
i
had
lost
all
joy
in
my
security
i
was
more
fevered
at
the
thought
of
laputa
escape
than
i
had
been
at
the
prospect
of
david
end
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
being
lifted
off
the
by
what
seemed
to
me
a
thousand
hands
then
came
a
glow
of
light
a
great
moon
in
the
centre
of
which
i
stood
blinking
i
was
forced
to
sit
down
on
a
bed
while
i
was
given
a
cup
of
hot
tea
far
more
reviving
than
any
spirits
i
became
conscious
that
some
one
was
holding
my
hands
and
speaking
very
slowly
and
gently
the
voice
said
back
among
friends
my
lad
tell
me
where
have
you
been
want
arcoll
i
moaned
is
ratitswan
there
were
tears
of
weakness
running
down
my
cheeks
is
here
said
the
voice
is
holding
your
hands
davie
quiet
lad
quiet
your
troubles
are
all
over
now
i
made
a
great
effort
found
the
eyes
to
which
the
voice
belonged
and
spoke
to
them
i
stole
the
collar
of
prester
john
at
dupree
drift
i
was
caught
in
the
berg
and
taken
to
the
kraal
i
forget
its
name
but
i
had
hid
the
rubies
the
voice
said
hid
the
rubies
and
then
wanted
them
back
so
i
made
a
deal
with
him
i
took
him
to
machudi
and
gave
him
the
collar
and
then
he
fired
at
me
and
i
climbed
and
climbed
i
climbed
on
a
horse
i
concluded
childishly
i
heard
the
voice
say
again
inquiringly
but
my
mind
ran
off
at
a
tangent
took
guns
up
into
the
wolkberg
i
cried
shrilly
the
devil
do
you
do
the
same
you
have
the
whole
kaffir
army
in
a
trap
i
saw
a
smiling
face
before
me
lad
colles
told
me
you
were
wanting
in
intelligence
what
if
we
have
done
that
very
thing
davie
but
i
was
not
listening
i
was
trying
to
remember
the
thing
i
most
wanted
to
say
and
that
was
not
about
beyers
and
his
guns
those
were
nightmare
minutes
a
speaker
who
has
lost
the
thread
of
his
discourse
a
soldier
who
with
a
bayonet
at
his
throat
has
forgotten
the
password
i
felt
like
them
and
worse
and
to
crown
all
i
felt
my
faintness
coming
back
and
my
head
dropping
with
heaviness
i
was
in
a
torment
of
impotence
arcoll
still
holding
my
hands
brought
his
face
close
to
mine
so
that
his
clear
eyes
mastered
and
constrained
me
at
me
davie
i
heard
him
say
have
something
to
tell
me
and
it
is
very
important
it
is
about
laputa
is
it
think
man
you
took
him
to
machudi
and
gave
him
the
collar
he
has
gone
back
with
it
to
inanda
kraal
very
well
my
guns
will
hold
him
there
i
shook
my
head
ca
you
may
split
the
army
but
you
hold
laputa
he
will
be
over
the
olifants
before
you
fire
a
shot
will
hunt
him
down
before
he
crosses
and
if
not
we
will
catch
him
at
the
railway
god
sake
hurry
then
i
cried
an
hour
he
will
be
over
it
and
back
in
the
kraal
the
river
is
a
long
way
i
repeated
hazily
river
the
letaba
is
not
the
place
it
is
the
road
i
mean
arcoll
hands
closed
firmly
on
my
wrists
left
laputa
at
machudi
and
rode
here
without
stopping
that
would
take
you
an
hour
had
laputa
a
horse
but
i
took
it
i
stammered
can
see
it
behind
me
arcoll
dropped
my
hands
and
stood
up
straight
god
we
got
him
he
said
and
he
spoke
to
his
companions
a
man
turned
and
ran
out
of
the
tent
then
i
remembered
what
i
wanted
to
say
i
struggled
from
the
bed
and
put
my
hands
on
his
shoulders
is
our
side
of
the
highroad
cut
him
off
from
his
men
and
drive
him
north
north
away
up
to
the
rooirand
never
mind
the
wolkberg
and
the
guns
for
they
can
wait
i
tell
you
laputa
is
the
rising
and
he
has
the
collar
without
him
you
can
mop
up
the
kaffirs
at
your
leisure
line
the
with
every
man
you
have
for
he
must
cross
it
or
perish
oh
hurry
man
hurry
never
mind
me
saved
if
we
can
chivy
laputa
till
morning
quick
or
i
have
to
go
myself
the
tent
emptied
and
i
lay
back
on
the
bed
with
a
dim
feeling
that
my
duty
was
done
and
i
could
rest
henceforth
the
affair
was
in
stronger
hands
than
mine
i
was
so
weak
that
i
could
not
lift
my
legs
up
to
the
bed
but
sprawled
half
on
and
half
off
utter
exhaustion
defeats
sleep
i
was
in
a
fever
and
my
eyes
would
not
close
i
lay
and
drowsed
while
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
outside
world
was
full
of
men
and
horses
i
heard
voices
and
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
the
jingle
of
bridles
but
above
all
i
heard
the
solid
tramp
of
an
army
the
whole
earth
seemed
to
be
full
of
war
before
my
mind
was
spread
the
ribbon
of
the
great
highway
i
saw
it
run
white
through
the
meadows
of
the
plateau
then
in
a
dark
corkscrew
down
the
glen
of
the
letaba
then
white
again
through
the
vast
moonlit
bush
of
the
plains
till
the
shanties
of
wesselsburg
rose
at
the
end
of
it
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
less
a
road
than
a
rampart
built
of
shining
marble
the
great
wall
of
africa
i
saw
laputa
come
out
of
the
shadows
and
try
to
climb
it
and
always
there
was
the
sound
of
a
clicking
a
summons
and
a
flight
i
began
to
take
a
keen
interest
in
the
game
down
in
the
bush
were
the
dark
figures
of
the
hunted
and
on
the
white
wall
were
my
own
people
horse
foot
and
artillery
the
squadrons
of
our
defence
what
a
general
arcoll
was
and
how
great
a
matter
had
david
crawfurd
kindled
a
man
came
in
i
suppose
a
doctor
he
took
off
my
leggings
and
boots
cutting
them
from
my
bleeding
feet
but
i
knew
no
pain
he
felt
my
pulse
and
listened
to
my
heart
then
he
washed
my
face
and
gave
me
a
bowl
of
hot
milk
there
must
have
been
a
drug
in
the
milk
for
i
had
scarcely
drunk
it
before
a
tide
of
sleep
seemed
to
flow
over
my
brain
the
white
rampart
faded
from
my
eyes
and
i
slept
chapter
xix
arcoll
shepherding
while
i
lay
in
a
drugged
slumber
great
things
were
happening
what
i
have
to
tell
is
no
experience
of
my
own
but
the
story
as
i
pieced
it
together
afterwards
from
talks
with
arcoll
and
aitken
the
history
of
the
rising
has
been
compiled
as
i
write
i
see
before
me
on
the
shelves
two
neat
blue
volumes
in
which
mr
alexander
upton
sometime
correspondent
of
the
has
told
for
the
edification
of
posterity
the
tale
of
the
war
between
the
plains
and
the
plateau
to
him
the
kaffir
hero
is
umbooni
a
ruffian
whom
we
afterwards
caught
and
hanged
he
mentions
laputa
only
in
a
footnote
as
a
renegade
christian
who
had
something
to
do
with
fomenting
discontent
he
considers
that
the
word
which
he
often
heard
was
a
zulu
name
for
god
mr
upton
is
a
picturesque
historian
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
most
romantic
incident
of
all
this
is
the
tale
of
the
midnight
shepherding
of
the
of
john
by
arcoll
and
his
irregulars
at
bruderstroom
where
i
was
lying
unconscious
there
were
two
hundred
men
of
the
police
basuto
scouts
under
a
man
called
stephen
who
was
half
native
in
blood
and
wholly
native
in
habits
and
three
commandoes
of
the
farmers
each
about
forty
strong
the
commandoes
were
really
companies
of
the
north
transvaal
volunteers
but
the
old
name
had
been
kept
and
something
of
the
old
loose
organization
there
were
also
two
batteries
of
volunteer
artillery
but
these
were
out
on
the
western
skirts
of
the
wolkberg
following
historic
precedent
several
companies
of
regulars
were
on
their
way
from
pietersdorp
but
they
did
not
arrive
till
the
next
day
when
they
came
they
went
to
the
wolkberg
to
join
the
artillery
along
the
berg
at
strategic
points
were
pickets
of
police
with
native
trackers
and
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
there
was
a
strong
force
with
two
field
guns
for
there
was
some
fear
of
a
second
kaffir
army
marching
by
that
place
to
inanda
kraal
at
wesselsburg
out
on
the
plain
there
was
a
biggish
police
patrol
and
a
system
of
small
patrols
along
the
road
with
a
fair
number
of
basuto
scouts
but
the
road
was
picketed
not
held
for
arcoll
patrols
were
only
a
branch
of
his
intelligence
department
it
was
perfectly
easy
as
i
had
found
myself
to
slip
across
in
a
gap
of
the
pickets
laputa
would
be
in
a
hurry
and
therefore
he
would
try
to
cross
at
the
nearest
point
hence
it
was
arcoll
first
business
to
hold
the
line
between
the
defile
of
the
letaba
and
the
camp
at
bruderstroom
a
detachment
of
the
police
who
were
well
mounted
galloped
at
racing
speed
for
the
defile
and
behind
them
the
rest
lined
out
along
the
road
the
farmers
took
a
line
at
right
angles
to
the
road
so
as
to
prevent
an
escape
on
the
western
flank
the
basutos
were
sent
into
the
woods
as
a
sort
of
advanced
post
to
bring
tidings
of
any
movement
there
finally
a
body
of
police
with
native
runners
at
their
stirrups
rode
on
to
the
drift
where
the
road
crosses
the
letaba
the
place
is
called
main
drift
and
you
will
find
it
on
the
map
the
natives
were
first
of
all
to
locate
laputa
and
prevent
him
getting
out
on
the
south
side
of
the
triangle
of
hill
and
wood
between
machudi
the
road
and
the
letaba
if
he
failed
there
he
must
try
to
ford
the
letaba
below
the
drift
and
cross
the
road
between
the
drift
and
wesselsburg
now
arcoll
had
not
men
enough
to
watch
the
whole
line
and
therefore
if
laputa
were
once
driven
below
the
drift
he
must
shift
his
men
farther
down
the
road
consequently
it
was
of
the
first
importance
to
locate
whereabouts
and
for
this
purpose
the
native
trackers
were
sent
forward
there
was
just
a
chance
of
capturing
him
but
arcoll
knew
too
well
his
amazing
and
great
strength
of
body
to
build
much
hope
on
that
we
were
none
too
soon
the
advance
men
of
the
police
rode
into
one
of
the
kaffirs
from
inanda
kraal
whom
laputa
had
sent
forward
to
see
if
the
way
was
clear
in
two
minutes
more
he
would
have
been
across
and
out
of
our
power
for
we
had
no
chance
of
overtaking
him
in
the
woody
ravines
of
the
letaba
the
kaffir
when
he
saw
us
dived
back
into
the
grass
on
the
north
side
of
the
road
which
made
it
clear
that
laputa
was
still
there
after
that
nothing
happened
for
a
little
the
police
reached
their
drift
and
all
the
road
west
of
that
point
was
strongly
held
the
flanking
commandoes
joined
hands
with
one
of
the
police
posts
farther
north
and
moved
slowly
to
the
scarp
of
the
berg
they
saw
nobody
from
which
arcoll
could
deduce
that
his
man
had
gone
down
the
berg
into
the
forests
had
the
basutos
been
any
good
at
woodcraft
we
should
have
had
better
intelligence
but
living
in
a
bare
mountain
country
they
are
apt
to
find
themselves
puzzled
in
a
forest
the
best
men
among
the
trackers
were
some
renegades
of
who
sent
back
word
by
a
device
known
only
to
arcoll
that
five
kaffirs
were
in
the
woods
a
mile
north
of
main
drift
by
this
time
it
was
after
ten
and
the
moon
was
rising
the
five
men
separated
soon
after
and
the
reports
became
confused
then
laputa
as
the
biggest
of
the
five
was
located
on
the
banks
of
the
great
letaba
about
two
miles
below
main
drift
the
question
was
as
to
his
crossing
arcoll
had
assumed
that
he
would
swim
the
river
and
try
to
get
over
the
road
between
main
drift
and
wesselsburg
but
in
this
assumption
he
underrated
the
shrewdness
of
his
opponent
laputa
knew
perfectly
well
that
we
had
not
enough
men
to
patrol
the
whole
countryside
but
that
the
river
enabled
us
to
divide
the
land
into
two
sections
and
concentrate
strongly
on
one
or
the
other
accordingly
he
left
the
great
letaba
unforded
and
resolved
to
make
a
long
circuit
back
to
the
berg
one
of
his
kaffirs
swam
the
river
and
when
word
of
this
was
brought
arcoll
began
to
withdraw
his
posts
farther
down
the
road
but
as
the
men
were
changing
fellows
got
wind
of
laputa
turn
to
the
left
and
in
great
haste
arcoll
countermanded
the
move
and
waited
in
deep
perplexity
at
main
drift
the
salvation
of
his
scheme
was
the
farmers
on
the
scarp
of
the
berg
they
lit
fires
and
gave
laputa
the
notion
of
a
great
army
instead
of
going
up
the
glen
of
machudi
or
the
letsitela
he
bore
away
to
the
north
for
the
valley
of
the
klein
letaba
the
pace
at
which
he
moved
must
have
been
amazing
he
had
a
great
physique
hard
as
nails
from
long
travelling
and
in
his
own
eyes
he
had
an
empire
at
stake
when
i
look
at
the
map
and
see
the
journey
which
with
vast
fatigue
i
completed
from
dupree
drift
to
machudi
and
then
look
at
the
huge
spaces
of
country
over
which
laputa
legs
took
him
on
that
night
i
am
lost
in
admiration
of
the
man
about
midnight
he
must
have
crossed
the
letsitela
here
he
made
a
grave
blunder
if
he
had
tried
the
berg
by
one
of
the
faces
he
might
have
got
on
to
the
plateau
and
been
at
inanda
kraal
by
the
dawning
but
he
the
size
of
the
commandoes
and
held
on
to
the
north
where
he
thought
there
would
be
no
defence
about
one
arcoll
tired
of
inaction
and
conscious
that
he
had
misread
tactics
resolved
on
a
bold
stroke
he
sent
half
his
police
to
the
berg
to
reinforce
the
commandoes
bidding
them
get
into
touch
with
the
post
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
a
little
after
two
a
diversion
occurred
henriques
succeeded
in
crossing
the
road
three
miles
east
of
main
drift
he
had
probably
left
the
kraal
early
in
the
night
and
had
tried
to
cross
farther
west
but
had
been
deterred
by
the
patrols
east
of
main
drift
where
the
police
were
fewer
he
succeeded
but
he
had
not
gone
far
till
he
was
discovered
by
the
basuto
scouts
the
find
was
reported
to
arcoll
who
guessed
at
once
who
this
traveller
was
he
dared
not
send
out
any
of
his
white
men
but
he
bade
a
party
of
the
scouts
follow
the
portugoose
trail
they
shadowed
him
to
dupree
drift
where
he
crossed
the
letaba
there
he
lay
down
by
the
roadside
to
sleep
while
they
kept
him
company
a
hard
fellow
henriques
was
for
he
could
slumber
peacefully
on
the
very
scene
of
his
murder
dawn
found
laputa
at
the
head
of
the
klein
letaba
glen
not
far
from
kraal
he
got
food
at
a
hut
and
set
off
at
once
up
the
wooded
hill
above
it
which
is
a
promontory
of
the
plateau
by
this
time
he
must
have
been
weary
or
he
would
not
have
blundered
as
he
did
right
into
a
post
of
the
farmers
he
was
within
an
ace
of
capture
and
to
save
himself
was
forced
back
from
the
scarp
he
seems
to
judge
from
reports
to
have
gone
a
little
way
south
in
the
thicker
timber
and
then
to
have
turned
north
again
in
the
direction
of
blaauwildebeestefontein
after
that
his
movements
are
obscure
he
was
seen
on
the
klein
labongo
but
the
sight
of
the
post
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
must
have
convinced
him
that
a
could
not
escape
that
way
the
next
we
heard
of
him
was
that
he
had
joined
henriques
after
daybreak
arcoll
having
got
his
reports
from
the
plateau
and
knowing
roughly
the
direction
in
which
laputa
was
shaping
decided
to
advance
his
lines
the
farmers
reinforced
by
three
more
commandoes
from
the
pietersdorp
district
still
held
the
plateau
but
the
police
were
now
on
the
line
of
the
great
letaba
it
was
plan
to
hold
that
river
and
the
long
neck
of
land
between
it
and
the
labongo
his
force
was
hourly
increasing
and
his
mounted
men
would
be
able
to
prevent
any
escape
on
the
flank
to
the
east
of
wesselsburg
so
it
happened
that
while
laputa
was
being
driven
east
from
the
berg
henriques
was
travelling
north
and
their
lines
intersected
i
should
like
to
have
seen
the
meeting
it
must
have
told
laputa
what
had
always
been
in
the
portugoose
heart
henriques
i
fancy
was
making
for
the
cave
in
the
rooirand
laputa
so
far
as
i
can
guess
at
his
mind
had
a
plan
for
getting
over
the
portuguese
border
fetching
a
wide
circuit
and
joining
his
men
at
any
of
the
concentrations
between
there
and
amsterdam
the
two
were
seen
at
midday
going
down
the
road
which
leads
from
blaauwildebeestefontein
to
the
lebombo
then
they
struck
arcoll
new
front
which
stretched
from
the
letaba
to
the
labongo
this
drove
them
north
again
and
forced
them
to
swim
the
latter
stream
from
there
to
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
rooirand
which
is
the
portuguese
frontier
the
country
is
open
and
rolling
with
a
thin
light
scrub
in
the
hollows
it
was
bad
cover
for
the
fugitives
as
they
found
to
their
cost
for
arcoll
had
purposely
turned
his
police
into
a
flying
column
they
no
longer
held
a
line
they
scoured
a
country
only
laputa
incomparable
and
great
bodily
strength
prevented
the
two
from
being
caught
in
half
an
hour
they
doubled
back
swam
the
labongo
again
and
got
into
the
thick
bush
on
the
north
side
of
the
blaauwildebeestefontein
road
the
basuto
scouts
were
magnificent
in
the
open
but
in
the
cover
they
were
again
at
fault
laputa
and
henriques
fairly
baffled
them
so
that
the
pursuit
turned
to
the
west
in
the
belief
that
the
fugitives
had
made
for
majinje
kraal
in
reality
they
had
recrossed
the
labongo
and
were
making
for
umvelos
all
this
i
heard
afterwards
but
in
the
meantime
i
lay
in
arcoll
tent
in
deep
unconsciousness
while
my
enemies
were
being
chased
like
partridges
i
was
reaping
the
fruits
of
four
days
toil
and
terror
the
hunters
had
become
the
hunted
the
wheel
had
come
full
circle
and
the
woes
of
david
crawfurd
were
being
abundantly
avenged
i
slept
till
midday
of
the
next
day
when
i
awoke
the
hot
noontide
sun
had
made
the
tent
like
an
oven
i
felt
better
but
very
stiff
and
sore
and
i
had
a
most
ungovernable
thirst
there
was
a
pail
of
water
with
a
tin
pannikin
beside
the
tent
pole
and
out
of
this
i
drank
repeated
draughts
then
i
lay
down
again
for
i
was
still
very
weary
but
my
second
sleep
was
not
like
my
first
it
was
haunted
by
wild
nightmares
no
sooner
had
i
closed
my
eyes
than
i
began
to
live
and
move
in
a
fantastic
world
the
whole
bush
of
the
plains
lay
before
me
and
i
watched
it
as
if
from
some
in
the
clouds
it
was
midday
and
the
sandy
patches
shimmered
under
a
haze
of
heat
i
saw
odd
little
movements
in
the
bush
a
buck
head
raised
a
paauw
stalking
solemnly
in
the
long
grass
a
big
crocodile
rolling
off
a
mudbank
in
the
river
and
then
i
saw
quite
clearly
laputa
figure
going
east
in
my
sleep
i
did
not
think
about
arcoll
manoeuvres
my
mind
was
wholly
set
upon
laputa
he
was
walking
wearily
yet
at
a
good
pace
and
his
head
was
always
turning
like
a
wild
creature
snuffing
the
wind
there
was
something
with
him
a
shapeless
shadow
which
i
could
not
see
clearly
his
neck
was
bare
but
i
knew
well
that
the
collar
was
in
his
pouch
he
stopped
turned
west
and
i
lost
him
the
bush
world
for
a
space
was
quite
silent
and
i
watched
it
eagerly
as
an
aeronaut
would
watch
the
ground
for
a
descent
for
a
long
time
i
could
see
nothing
then
in
a
wood
near
a
river
there
seemed
to
be
a
rustling
some
flew
up
as
if
startled
and
a
stembok
scurried
out
i
knew
that
laputa
must
be
there
then
as
i
looked
at
the
river
i
saw
a
head
swimming
nay
i
saw
two
one
some
distance
behind
the
other
the
first
man
landed
on
the
far
bank
and
i
recognized
laputa
the
second
was
a
slight
short
figure
and
i
knew
it
was
henriques
i
remember
feeling
very
glad
that
these
two
had
come
together
it
was
certain
now
that
henriques
would
not
escape
either
laputa
would
find
out
the
truth
and
kill
him
or
i
would
come
up
with
him
and
have
my
revenge
in
any
case
he
was
outside
the
kaffir
pale
adventuring
on
his
own
i
watched
the
two
till
they
halted
near
a
ruined
building
surely
this
was
the
store
i
had
built
at
umvelos
the
thought
gave
me
a
horrid
surprise
laputa
and
henriques
were
on
their
way
to
the
rooirand
i
woke
with
a
start
to
find
my
forehead
damp
with
sweat
there
was
some
fever
on
me
i
think
for
my
teeth
were
chattering
very
clear
in
my
mind
was
the
disquieting
thought
that
laputa
and
henriques
would
soon
be
in
the
cave
one
of
two
things
must
happen
either
henriques
would
kill
laputa
get
the
collar
of
rubies
and
be
in
the
wilds
of
mozambique
before
i
could
come
up
with
his
trail
or
laputa
would
outwit
him
and
have
the
handling
himself
of
the
treasure
of
gold
and
diamonds
which
had
been
laid
up
for
the
rising
if
he
thought
there
was
a
risk
of
defeat
i
knew
he
would
send
my
gems
to
the
bottom
of
the
labongo
and
all
my
weary
work
would
go
for
nothing
i
had
forgotten
all
about
patriotism
in
that
hour
the
fate
of
the
country
was
nothing
to
me
and
i
got
no
satisfaction
from
the
thought
that
laputa
was
severed
from
his
army
my
one
idea
was
that
the
treasure
would
be
lost
the
treasure
for
which
i
had
risked
my
life
there
is
a
kind
of
courage
which
springs
from
bitter
anger
and
disappointment
i
had
thought
that
i
had
bankrupted
my
spirit
but
i
found
that
there
was
a
new
passion
in
me
to
which
my
past
sufferings
taught
no
lesson
my
uneasiness
would
not
let
me
rest
a
moment
longer
i
rose
to
my
feet
holding
on
by
the
bed
and
staggered
to
the
tent
pole
i
was
weak
but
not
so
very
weak
that
i
could
not
make
one
last
effort
it
maddened
me
that
i
should
have
done
so
much
and
yet
fail
at
the
end
from
a
nail
on
the
tent
pole
hung
a
fragment
of
which
arcoll
used
for
shaving
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
my
face
in
it
white
and
haggard
and
lined
with
blue
bags
below
the
eyes
the
doctor
the
night
before
had
sponged
it
but
he
had
not
got
rid
of
all
the
stains
of
travel
in
particular
there
was
a
faint
splash
of
blood
on
the
left
temple
i
remembered
that
this
was
what
i
had
got
from
the
basin
of
goat
blood
that
night
in
the
cave
i
think
that
the
sight
of
that
splash
determined
me
whether
i
willed
it
or
not
i
was
sealed
of
laputa
men
i
must
play
the
game
to
the
finish
or
never
again
know
peace
of
mind
on
earth
these
last
four
days
had
made
me
very
old
i
found
a
pair
of
arcoll
boots
roomy
with
much
wearing
into
which
i
thrust
my
bruised
feet
then
i
crawled
to
the
door
and
shouted
for
a
boy
to
bring
my
horse
a
basuto
appeared
and
awed
by
my
appearance
went
off
in
a
hurry
to
see
to
the
it
was
late
afternoon
about
the
same
time
of
day
as
had
yesterday
seen
me
escaping
from
machudi
the
bruderstroom
camp
was
empty
though
sentinels
were
posted
at
the
approaches
i
beckoned
the
only
white
man
i
saw
and
asked
where
arcoll
was
he
told
me
that
he
had
no
news
but
added
that
the
patrols
were
still
on
the
road
as
far
as
wesselsburg
from
this
i
gathered
that
arcoll
must
have
gone
far
out
into
the
bush
in
his
chase
i
did
not
want
to
see
him
above
all
i
did
not
want
him
to
find
laputa
it
was
my
private
business
that
i
rode
on
and
i
asked
for
no
allies
somebody
brought
me
a
cup
of
thick
coffee
which
i
could
not
drink
and
helped
me
into
the
saddle
the
was
fresh
and
kicked
freely
as
i
cantered
off
the
grass
into
the
dust
of
the
highroad
the
whole
world
i
remember
was
still
and
golden
in
the
sunset
chapter
xx
my
last
sight
of
the
reverend
john
laputa
it
was
dark
before
i
got
into
the
gorge
of
the
letaba
i
passed
many
patrols
but
few
spoke
to
me
and
none
tried
to
stop
me
some
may
have
known
me
but
i
think
it
was
my
face
and
figure
which
tied
their
tongues
i
must
have
been
pale
as
death
with
tangled
hair
and
fever
burning
in
my
eyes
also
on
my
left
temple
was
the
splash
of
blood
at
main
drift
i
found
a
big
body
of
police
holding
the
ford
i
splashed
through
and
stumbled
into
one
of
their
a
man
questioned
me
and
told
me
that
arcoll
had
got
his
quarry
dead
they
say
they
shot
him
out
on
the
hills
when
he
was
making
for
the
limpopo
but
i
knew
that
this
was
not
true
it
was
burned
on
my
mind
that
laputa
was
alive
nay
was
waiting
for
me
and
that
it
was
god
will
that
we
should
meet
in
the
cave
a
little
later
i
struck
the
track
of
the
kaffirs
march
there
was
a
broad
trampled
way
through
the
bush
and
i
followed
it
for
it
led
to
dupree
drift
all
this
time
i
was
urging
the
with
all
the
vigour
i
had
left
in
me
i
had
quite
lost
any
remnant
of
fear
there
were
no
terrors
left
for
me
either
from
nature
or
man
at
drift
i
rode
the
ford
without
a
thought
of
crocodiles
i
looked
placidly
at
the
spot
where
henriques
had
slain
the
keeper
and
i
had
stolen
the
rubies
there
was
no
interest
or
imagination
lingering
in
my
dull
brain
my
nerves
had
suddenly
become
things
of
stolid
untempered
iron
each
landmark
i
passed
was
noted
down
as
one
step
nearer
to
my
object
at
umvelos
i
had
not
the
leisure
to
do
more
than
glance
at
the
shell
which
i
had
built
i
think
i
had
forgotten
all
about
that
night
when
i
lay
in
the
cellar
and
heard
laputa
plans
indeed
my
doings
of
the
past
days
were
all
hazy
and
trivial
in
my
mind
i
only
saw
one
sight
clearly
two
men
one
tall
and
black
the
other
little
and
sallow
slowly
creeping
nearer
to
the
rooirand
and
myself
a
midget
on
a
horse
spurring
far
behind
through
the
bush
on
their
trail
i
saw
the
picture
as
continuously
and
clearly
as
if
i
had
been
looking
at
a
scene
on
the
stage
there
was
only
one
change
in
the
setting
the
three
figures
seemed
to
be
gradually
closing
together
i
had
no
exhilaration
in
my
quest
i
do
not
think
i
had
even
much
hope
for
something
had
gone
numb
and
cold
in
me
and
killed
my
youth
i
told
myself
that
was
an
enterprise
accursed
of
god
and
that
i
should
most
likely
die
that
laputa
and
henriques
would
die
i
was
fully
certain
the
three
of
us
would
leave
our
bones
to
bleach
among
the
diamonds
and
in
a
little
the
prester
collar
would
glow
amid
a
little
heap
of
human
dust
i
was
quite
convinced
of
all
this
and
quite
apathetic
it
really
did
not
matter
so
long
as
i
came
up
with
laputa
and
henriques
and
settled
scores
with
them
that
mattered
everything
in
the
world
for
it
was
my
destiny
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
how
long
i
took
but
it
was
after
midnight
before
i
passed
umvelos
and
ere
i
got
to
the
rooirand
there
was
a
fluttering
of
dawn
in
the
east
i
must
have
passed
east
of
men
who
were
driving
the
bush
towards
majinje
i
had
ridden
the
night
down
and
did
not
feel
so
very
tired
my
horse
was
stumbling
but
my
own
limbs
scarcely
pained
me
to
be
sure
i
was
stiff
and
nerveless
as
if
hewn
out
of
wood
but
i
had
been
as
bad
when
i
left
bruderstroom
i
felt
as
if
i
could
go
on
riding
to
the
end
of
the
world
at
the
brink
of
the
bush
i
dismounted
and
turned
the
loose
i
had
brought
no
halter
and
i
left
him
to
graze
and
roll
the
light
was
sufficient
to
let
me
see
the
great
rock
face
rising
in
a
tower
of
dim
purple
the
sky
was
still
picked
out
with
stars
but
the
moon
had
long
gone
down
and
the
east
was
flushing
i
marched
up
the
path
to
the
cave
very
different
from
the
timid
being
who
had
walked
the
same
road
three
nights
before
then
my
terrors
were
all
to
come
now
i
had
conquered
terror
and
seen
the
other
side
of
fear
i
was
centuries
older
but
beside
the
path
lay
something
which
made
me
pause
it
was
a
dead
body
and
the
head
was
turned
away
from
me
i
did
not
need
to
see
the
face
to
know
who
it
was
there
had
been
only
two
men
in
my
vision
and
one
of
them
was
immortal
i
stopped
and
turned
the
body
over
there
was
no
joy
in
my
heart
none
of
the
lust
of
satisfied
vengeance
or
slaked
hate
i
had
forgotten
about
the
killing
of
my
dog
and
all
the
rest
of
henriques
doings
it
was
only
with
curiosity
that
i
looked
down
on
the
dead
face
swollen
and
livid
in
the
first
light
of
morning
the
man
had
been
strangled
his
neck
as
we
say
in
scotland
was
and
that
was
why
he
had
lain
on
his
back
yet
with
his
face
turned
away
from
me
he
had
been
dead
probably
since
before
midnight
i
looked
closer
and
saw
that
there
was
blood
on
his
shirt
and
hands
but
no
wound
it
was
not
his
blood
but
some
other
then
a
few
feet
off
on
the
path
i
found
a
pistol
with
two
chambers
empty
what
had
happened
was
very
plain
henriques
had
tried
to
shoot
laputa
at
the
entrance
of
the
cave
for
the
sake
of
the
collar
and
the
treasure
within
he
had
wounded
him
gravely
i
thought
to
judge
from
the
amount
of
blood
but
the
quickness
and
marksmanship
of
the
portuguese
had
not
availed
to
save
his
life
from
those
terrible
hands
after
two
shots
laputa
had
got
hold
of
him
and
choked
his
life
out
as
easily
as
a
man
twists
a
partridge
neck
then
he
had
gone
into
the
cave
i
saw
the
marks
of
blood
on
the
road
and
hastened
on
laputa
had
been
hours
in
the
cave
enough
to
work
havoc
with
the
treasure
he
was
wounded
too
and
desperate
probably
he
had
come
to
the
rooirand
looking
for
sanctuary
and
rest
for
a
day
or
two
but
if
henriques
had
shot
straight
he
might
find
a
safer
sanctuary
and
a
longer
rest
for
the
third
time
in
my
life
i
pushed
up
the
gully
between
the
straight
high
walls
of
rock
and
heard
from
the
heart
of
the
hills
the
thunder
of
the
imprisoned
river
there
was
only
the
faintest
gleam
of
light
in
the
cleft
but
it
sufficed
to
show
me
that
the
way
to
the
cave
was
open
the
hidden
turnstile
in
the
right
wall
stood
ajar
i
entered
and
carelessly
swung
it
behind
me
the
gates
clashed
into
place
with
a
finality
which
told
me
that
they
were
firmly
shut
i
did
not
know
the
secret
of
them
so
how
should
i
get
out
again
these
things
troubled
me
less
than
the
fact
that
i
had
no
light
at
all
now
i
had
to
go
on
my
knees
to
ascend
the
stair
and
i
could
feel
that
the
steps
were
wet
it
must
be
laputa
blood
next
i
was
out
on
the
gallery
which
skirted
the
chasm
the
sky
above
me
was
growing
pale
with
dawn
and
far
below
the
tossing
waters
were
fretted
with
light
a
light
fragrant
wind
was
blowing
on
the
hills
and
a
breath
of
it
came
down
the
funnel
i
saw
that
my
hands
were
all
bloody
with
the
stains
on
the
steps
and
i
rubbed
them
on
the
rock
to
clean
them
without
a
tremor
i
crossed
the
stone
slab
over
the
gorge
and
plunged
into
the
dark
alley
which
led
to
the
inner
chamber
as
before
there
was
a
light
in
front
of
me
but
this
time
it
was
a
and
not
the
glare
of
many
torches
i
felt
my
way
carefully
by
the
walls
of
the
passage
though
i
did
not
really
fear
anything
it
was
by
the
stopping
of
these
lateral
walls
that
i
knew
i
was
in
the
cave
for
the
place
had
only
one
single
speck
of
light
the
falling
wall
of
water
stood
out
grey
green
and
ghostly
on
the
left
and
i
noticed
that
higher
up
it
was
lit
as
if
from
the
open
air
there
must
be
a
great
funnel
in
the
hillside
in
that
direction
i
walked
a
few
paces
and
then
i
made
out
that
the
spark
in
front
was
a
lantern
my
eyes
were
getting
used
to
the
and
i
saw
what
was
beside
the
lantern
laputa
knelt
on
the
ashes
of
the
fire
which
the
keeper
had
kindled
three
days
before
he
knelt
before
and
half
leaned
on
a
rude
altar
of
stone
the
lantern
stood
by
him
on
the
floor
and
its
faint
circle
lit
something
which
i
was
not
unprepared
for
blood
was
welling
from
his
side
and
spreading
in
a
dark
pool
over
the
ashes
i
had
no
fear
only
a
great
pity
pity
for
lost
romance
for
vain
endeavour
for
fruitless
courage
inkulu
i
said
in
kaffir
as
if
i
had
been
one
of
his
indunas
he
turned
his
head
and
slowly
and
painfully
rose
to
his
feet
the
place
it
was
clear
was
lit
from
without
and
the
daylight
was
growing
the
wall
of
the
river
had
become
a
sheet
of
jewels
passing
from
pellucid
diamond
above
to
translucent
emerald
below
a
dusky
twilight
sought
out
the
extreme
corners
of
the
cave
laputa
tall
figure
stood
swaying
above
the
white
ashes
his
hand
pressed
to
his
side
is
it
he
said
looking
at
me
with
blind
eyes
is
the
storekeeper
from
umvelos
i
answered
storekeeper
of
umvelos
he
repeated
has
used
the
weak
things
of
the
world
to
confound
the
strong
a
king
dies
because
a
pedlar
is
troublesome
what
do
they
call
you
man
you
deserve
to
be
remembered
i
told
him
crawfurd
he
repeated
have
been
the
little
reef
on
which
a
great
vessel
has
foundered
you
stole
the
collar
and
cut
me
off
from
my
people
and
then
when
i
was
weary
the
portuguese
killed
me
i
cried
was
not
me
you
trusted
henriques
and
you
got
your
fingers
on
his
neck
too
late
do
say
i
did
warn
you
warned
me
and
i
will
repay
you
i
will
make
you
rich
crawfurd
you
are
a
trader
and
want
money
i
am
a
king
and
want
a
throne
but
i
am
dying
and
there
will
be
no
more
kings
in
africa
the
mention
of
riches
did
not
thrill
me
as
i
had
expected
but
the
last
words
awakened
a
wild
regret
i
was
hypnotized
by
the
man
to
see
him
going
out
was
like
seeing
the
fall
of
a
great
mountain
he
stretched
himself
gasping
and
in
the
growing
light
i
could
see
how
broken
he
was
his
cheeks
were
falling
in
and
his
sombre
eyes
had
shrunk
back
in
their
sockets
he
seemed
an
old
worn
man
standing
there
among
the
ashes
while
the
blood
which
he
made
no
effort
to
staunch
trickled
down
his
side
till
it
dripped
on
the
floor
he
had
ceased
to
be
the
kaffir
king
or
the
christian
minister
or
indeed
any
one
of
his
former
parts
death
was
stripping
him
to
his
elements
and
the
man
laputa
stood
out
beyond
and
above
the
characters
he
had
played
something
strange
and
great
and
moving
and
terrible
met
for
the
first
time
three
days
ago
he
said
now
you
will
be
the
last
to
see
the
inkulu
was
not
our
first
meeting
said
i
you
mind
the
sabbath
eight
years
since
when
you
preached
in
the
free
kirk
at
kirkcaple
i
was
the
boy
you
chased
from
the
shore
and
i
flung
the
stone
that
blacked
your
eye
besides
i
came
out
from
england
with
you
and
henriques
and
i
was
in
the
boat
which
took
you
from
durban
to
delagoa
bay
you
and
i
have
been
long
acquaint
mr
laputa
is
the
hand
of
god
he
said
solemnly
fate
has
been
twisted
with
mine
and
now
you
will
die
with
me
i
did
not
understand
this
talk
about
dying
i
was
not
mortally
wounded
like
him
and
i
did
not
think
laputa
had
the
strength
to
kill
me
even
if
he
wished
but
my
mind
was
so
impassive
that
i
scarcely
regarded
his
words
will
make
you
rich
he
cried
the
storekeeper
will
be
the
richest
man
in
africa
we
are
scattered
and
our
wealth
is
another
he
shall
have
the
gold
and
the
diamonds
all
but
the
collar
which
goes
with
me
he
staggered
into
a
dark
recess
one
of
many
in
the
cave
and
i
followed
him
there
were
boxes
there
tea
chests
cartridge
cases
and
old
portuguese
coffers
laputa
had
keys
at
his
belt
and
unlocked
them
his
fingers
fumbling
with
weakness
i
peered
in
and
saw
gold
coin
and
little
bags
of
stones
and
diamonds
he
cried
it
was
the
war
chest
of
a
king
and
now
it
will
be
the
hoard
of
a
trader
no
by
the
lord
the
trader
place
is
with
the
terrible
ones
an
arm
shot
out
and
my
shoulder
was
fiercely
gripped
stole
my
horse
that
is
why
i
am
dying
but
for
you
i
and
my
army
would
be
over
the
olifants
i
am
going
to
kill
you
crawfurd
and
his
fingers
closed
in
to
my
shoulder
blades
still
i
was
unperturbed
you
are
not
you
can
not
you
have
tried
to
and
failed
so
did
henriques
and
he
is
lying
dead
outside
i
am
in
god
keeping
and
can
not
die
before
my
time
i
do
not
know
if
he
heard
me
but
at
any
rate
the
murderous
fit
passed
his
hand
fell
to
his
side
and
his
great
figure
tottered
out
into
the
cave
he
seemed
to
be
making
for
the
river
but
he
turned
and
went
through
the
door
i
had
entered
by
i
heard
him
slipping
in
the
passage
and
then
there
was
a
minute
of
silence
suddenly
there
came
a
grinding
sound
followed
by
the
kind
of
muffled
splash
which
a
stone
makes
when
it
falls
into
a
deep
well
i
thought
laputa
had
fallen
into
the
chasm
but
when
i
reached
the
door
his
swaying
figure
was
coming
out
of
the
corridor
then
i
knew
what
he
had
done
he
had
used
the
remnant
of
his
giant
strength
to
break
down
the
bridge
of
stone
across
the
gorge
and
so
cut
off
my
retreat
i
really
did
not
care
even
if
i
had
got
over
the
bridge
i
should
probably
have
been
foiled
by
the
shut
turnstile
i
had
quite
forgotten
the
meaning
of
fear
of
death
i
found
myself
giving
my
arm
to
the
man
who
had
tried
to
destroy
me
have
laid
up
for
you
treasure
in
heaven
he
said
earthly
treasure
is
in
the
boxes
but
soon
you
will
be
seeking
incorruptible
jewels
in
the
deep
deep
water
it
is
cool
and
quiet
down
there
and
you
forget
the
hunger
and
pain
the
man
was
getting
very
near
his
end
the
madness
of
despair
came
back
to
him
and
he
flung
himself
among
the
ashes
are
going
to
die
together
crawfurd
he
said
has
twined
our
threads
and
there
will
be
only
one
cutting
tell
me
what
has
become
of
my
army
has
guns
on
the
wolkberg
i
said
must
submit
or
perish
have
other
armies
no
no
they
are
nothing
they
will
all
wander
and
blunder
and
fight
and
be
beaten
there
is
no
leader
anywhere
and
i
am
dying
there
was
no
gainsaying
the
signs
of
death
i
asked
him
if
he
would
like
water
but
he
made
no
answer
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
vacancy
and
i
thought
i
could
realize
something
of
the
bitterness
of
that
great
regret
for
myself
i
was
as
cold
as
a
stone
i
had
no
exultation
of
triumph
still
less
any
fear
of
my
own
fate
i
stood
silent
the
spectator
of
a
fall
like
the
fall
of
lucifer
would
have
taught
the
world
wisdom
laputa
was
speaking
english
in
a
strange
thin
abstracted
voice
would
have
been
no
king
like
me
since
charlemagne
and
he
strayed
into
latin
which
i
have
been
told
since
was
an
adaptation
of
the
epitaph
of
charles
the
great
hoc
he
crooned
est
corpus
joannis
magni
et
orthodoxi
imperatoris
qui
imperium
africanum
nobiliter
ampliavit
et
multos
per
annos
mundum
feliciter
he
must
have
chosen
this
epitaph
long
ago
he
lay
for
a
few
seconds
with
his
head
on
his
arms
his
breast
heaving
with
agony
one
will
come
after
me
my
race
is
doomed
and
in
a
little
they
will
have
forgotten
my
name
i
alone
could
have
saved
them
now
they
go
the
way
of
the
rest
and
the
warriors
of
john
become
drudges
and
slaves
something
clicked
in
his
throat
he
gasped
and
fell
forward
and
i
thought
he
was
dead
then
he
struggled
as
if
to
rise
i
ran
to
him
and
with
all
my
strength
aided
him
to
his
feet
eros
he
cried
long
day
task
is
done
with
the
strange
power
of
a
dying
man
he
tore
off
his
and
belt
till
he
stood
stark
as
on
the
night
when
he
had
been
crowned
from
his
pouch
he
took
the
prester
collar
then
he
staggered
to
the
brink
of
the
chasm
where
the
wall
of
green
water
dropped
into
the
dark
depth
below
i
watched
fascinated
as
with
the
weak
hands
of
a
child
he
twined
the
rubies
round
his
neck
and
joined
the
clasp
then
with
a
last
effort
he
stood
straight
up
on
the
brink
his
eyes
raised
to
the
belt
of
daylight
from
which
the
water
fell
the
light
caught
the
great
gems
and
called
fires
from
them
the
flames
of
the
funeral
pyre
of
a
king
once
more
his
voice
restored
for
a
moment
to
its
old
vigour
rang
out
through
the
cave
above
the
din
of
the
cascade
his
words
were
those
which
the
keeper
had
used
three
nights
before
with
his
hands
held
high
and
the
collar
burning
on
his
neck
he
cried
snake
returns
to
the
house
of
its
birth
he
cried
to
me
heir
of
john
is
going
home
then
he
leapt
into
the
gulf
there
was
no
sound
of
falling
so
great
was
the
rush
of
water
he
must
have
been
whirled
into
the
open
below
where
the
bridge
used
to
be
and
then
swept
into
the
underground
deeps
where
the
labongo
drowses
for
thirty
miles
far
from
human
quest
he
sleeps
his
last
sleep
and
perhaps
on
a
fragment
of
bone
washed
into
a
crevice
of
rock
there
may
hang
the
jewels
that
once
gleamed
in
sheba
hair
this
stone
is
laid
the
body
of
john
the
great
and
orthodox
emperor
who
nobly
enlarged
the
african
realm
and
for
many
years
happily
ruled
the
world
chapter
xxi
i
climb
the
crags
a
second
time
i
remember
that
i
looked
over
the
brink
into
the
yeasty
abyss
with
a
mind
hovering
between
perplexity
and
tears
i
wanted
to
sit
down
and
cry
why
i
did
not
know
except
that
some
great
thing
had
happened
my
brain
was
quite
clear
as
to
my
own
position
i
was
shut
in
this
place
with
no
chance
of
escape
and
with
no
food
in
a
little
i
must
die
of
starvation
or
go
mad
and
throw
myself
after
laputa
and
yet
i
did
not
care
a
rush
my
nerves
had
been
tried
too
greatly
in
the
past
week
now
i
was
comatose
and
beyond
hoping
or
fearing
i
sat
for
a
long
time
watching
the
light
play
on
the
fretted
sheet
of
water
and
wondering
where
laputa
body
had
gone
i
shivered
and
wished
he
had
not
left
me
alone
for
the
darkness
would
come
in
time
and
i
had
no
matches
after
a
little
i
got
tired
of
doing
nothing
and
went
groping
among
the
treasure
chests
one
or
two
were
full
of
coin
british
sovereigns
kruger
sovereigns
napoleons
spanish
and
portuguese
gold
pieces
and
many
older
coins
ranging
back
to
the
middle
ages
and
even
to
the
ancients
in
one
handful
there
was
a
splendid
gold
stater
and
in
another
a
piece
of
antoninus
pius
the
treasure
had
been
collected
for
many
years
in
many
places
contributions
of
chiefs
from
ancient
hoards
as
well
as
the
cash
received
from
i
untied
one
or
two
of
the
little
bags
of
stones
and
poured
the
contents
into
my
hands
most
of
the
diamonds
were
small
such
as
a
labourer
might
secrete
on
his
person
the
larger
ones
and
some
were
very
large
were
as
a
rule
discoloured
looking
more
like
big
cairngorms
but
one
or
two
bags
had
big
stones
which
even
my
inexperienced
eye
told
me
were
of
the
purest
water
there
must
be
some
new
pipe
i
thought
for
these
could
not
have
been
stolen
from
any
known
mine
after
that
i
sat
on
the
floor
again
and
looked
at
the
water
it
exercised
a
mesmeric
influence
on
me
soothing
all
care
i
was
quite
happy
to
wait
for
death
for
death
had
no
meaning
to
me
my
hate
and
fury
were
both
lulled
into
a
trance
since
the
passive
is
the
next
stage
to
the
overwrought
it
must
have
been
full
day
outside
now
for
the
funnel
was
bright
with
sunshine
and
even
the
dim
cave
caught
a
reflected
radiance
as
i
watched
the
river
i
saw
a
bird
flash
downward
skimming
the
water
it
turned
into
the
cave
and
fluttered
among
its
dark
recesses
i
heard
its
wings
beating
the
roof
as
it
sought
wildly
for
an
outlet
it
dashed
into
the
spray
of
the
cataract
and
escaped
again
into
the
cave
for
maybe
twenty
minutes
it
fluttered
till
at
last
it
found
the
way
it
had
entered
by
with
a
dart
it
sped
up
the
funnel
of
rock
into
light
and
freedom
i
had
begun
to
watch
the
bird
in
idle
lassitude
i
ended
in
keen
excitement
the
sight
of
it
seemed
to
take
a
film
from
my
eyes
i
realized
the
zest
of
liberty
the
passion
of
life
again
i
felt
that
beyond
this
dim
underworld
there
was
the
great
joyous
earth
and
i
longed
for
it
i
wanted
to
live
now
my
memory
cleared
and
i
remembered
all
that
had
befallen
me
during
the
last
few
days
i
had
played
the
chief
part
in
the
whole
business
and
i
had
won
laputa
was
dead
and
the
treasure
was
mine
while
arcoll
was
crushing
the
rising
at
his
ease
i
had
only
to
be
free
again
to
be
famous
and
rich
my
hopes
had
returned
but
with
them
came
my
fears
what
if
i
could
not
escape
i
must
perish
miserably
by
degrees
shut
in
the
heart
of
a
hill
though
my
friends
were
out
for
rescue
in
place
of
my
former
lethargy
i
was
now
in
a
fever
of
unrest
my
first
care
was
to
explore
the
way
i
had
come
i
ran
down
the
passage
to
the
chasm
which
the
slab
of
stone
had
spanned
i
had
been
right
in
my
guess
for
the
thing
was
gone
laputa
was
in
truth
a
titan
who
in
the
article
of
death
could
break
down
a
bridge
which
would
have
taken
any
three
men
an
hour
to
shift
the
gorge
was
about
seven
yards
wide
too
far
to
risk
a
jump
and
the
cliff
fell
sheer
and
smooth
to
the
imprisoned
waters
two
hundred
feet
below
there
was
no
chance
of
circuiting
it
for
the
wall
was
as
smooth
as
if
it
had
been
chiselled
the
hand
of
man
had
been
at
work
to
make
the
sanctuary
inviolable
it
occurred
to
me
that
sooner
or
later
arcoll
would
track
laputa
to
this
place
he
would
find
the
bloodstains
in
the
gully
but
the
turnstile
would
be
shut
and
he
would
never
find
the
trick
of
it
nor
could
he
have
any
kaffirs
with
him
who
knew
the
secret
of
the
place
of
the
snake
still
if
arcoll
knew
i
was
inside
he
would
find
some
way
to
get
to
me
even
though
he
had
to
dynamite
the
curtain
of
rock
i
shouted
but
my
voice
seemed
to
be
drowned
in
the
roar
of
the
water
it
made
but
a
fresh
chord
in
the
wild
orchestra
and
i
gave
up
hopes
in
that
direction
very
dolefully
i
returned
to
the
cave
i
was
about
to
share
the
experience
of
all
to
be
left
with
jewels
galore
and
not
a
bite
to
sustain
life
the
thing
was
too
commonplace
to
be
endured
i
grew
angry
and
declined
so
obvious
a
fate
sal
plan
maak
i
told
myself
in
the
old
dutchman
words
i
had
come
through
worse
dangers
and
a
way
i
should
find
to
starve
in
the
cave
was
no
ending
for
david
crawfurd
far
better
to
join
laputa
in
the
depths
in
a
manly
hazard
for
liberty
my
obstinacy
and
irritation
cheered
me
what
had
become
of
the
young
fool
who
had
mooned
here
a
few
minutes
back
now
i
was
as
tense
and
strung
for
effort
as
the
day
i
had
ridden
from
blaauwildebeestefontein
to
umvelos
i
felt
like
a
runner
in
the
last
lap
of
a
race
for
four
days
i
had
lived
in
the
midst
of
terror
and
darkness
daylight
was
only
a
few
steps
ahead
daylight
and
youth
restored
and
a
new
world
there
were
only
two
outlets
from
that
cave
the
way
i
had
come
and
the
way
the
river
came
the
first
was
closed
the
second
a
sheer
staring
impossibility
i
had
been
into
every
niche
and
cranny
and
there
was
no
sign
of
a
passage
i
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
looked
at
the
wall
of
water
it
fell
as
i
have
already
explained
in
a
solid
sheet
which
made
up
the
whole
of
the
wall
of
the
cave
higher
than
the
roof
of
the
cave
i
could
not
see
what
happened
except
that
it
must
be
the
open
air
for
the
sun
was
shining
on
it
the
water
was
about
three
yards
distant
from
the
edge
of
the
cave
floor
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
high
up
level
with
the
roof
this
distance
decreased
to
little
more
than
a
foot
i
could
not
see
what
the
walls
of
the
cave
were
like
but
they
looked
smooth
and
difficult
supposing
i
managed
to
climb
up
to
the
level
of
the
roof
close
to
the
water
how
on
earth
was
i
to
get
outside
on
to
the
wall
of
the
ravine
i
knew
from
my
old
days
of
what
a
complete
obstacle
the
overhang
of
a
cave
is
while
i
looked
however
i
saw
a
thing
which
i
had
not
noticed
before
on
the
left
side
of
the
fall
the
water
sluiced
down
in
a
sheet
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
cave
almost
sprinkling
the
floor
with
water
but
on
the
right
side
the
force
of
water
was
obviously
weaker
and
a
little
short
of
the
level
of
the
cave
roof
there
was
a
spike
of
rock
which
slightly
broke
the
fall
the
spike
was
covered
but
the
covering
was
shallow
for
the
current
flowed
from
it
in
a
spray
if
a
man
could
get
to
that
spike
and
could
get
a
foot
on
it
without
being
swept
down
it
might
be
possible
just
possible
to
do
something
with
the
wall
of
the
chasm
above
the
cave
of
course
i
knew
nothing
about
the
nature
of
that
wall
it
might
be
as
smooth
as
a
polished
pillar
the
result
of
these
cogitations
was
that
i
decided
to
prospect
the
right
wall
of
the
cave
close
to
the
waterfall
but
first
i
went
rummaging
in
the
back
part
to
see
if
i
could
find
anything
to
assist
me
in
one
corner
there
was
a
rude
cupboard
with
some
stone
and
metal
vessels
here
too
were
the
few
domestic
utensils
of
the
dead
keeper
in
another
were
several
locked
coffers
on
which
i
could
make
no
impression
there
were
the
too
but
they
held
nothing
save
treasure
and
gold
and
diamonds
were
no
manner
of
use
to
me
other
odds
and
ends
i
found
spears
a
few
skins
and
a
broken
and
notched
axe
i
took
the
axe
in
case
there
might
be
cutting
to
do
then
at
the
back
of
a
bin
my
hand
struck
something
which
brought
the
blood
to
my
face
it
was
a
rope
an
old
one
but
still
in
fair
condition
and
forty
or
fifty
feet
long
i
dragged
it
out
into
the
light
and
straightened
its
kinks
with
this
something
could
be
done
assuming
i
could
cut
my
way
to
the
level
of
the
roof
i
began
the
climb
in
my
bare
feet
and
at
the
beginning
it
was
very
bad
except
on
the
very
edge
of
the
abyss
there
was
scarcely
a
handhold
possibly
in
floods
the
waters
may
have
swept
the
wall
in
a
curve
smoothing
down
the
inner
part
and
leaving
the
outer
to
its
natural
roughness
there
was
one
place
where
i
had
to
hang
on
by
a
very
narrow
crack
while
i
scraped
with
the
axe
a
hollow
for
my
right
foot
and
then
about
twelve
feet
from
the
ground
i
struck
the
first
of
the
iron
pegs
to
this
day
i
can
not
think
what
these
pegs
were
for
they
were
old
things
which
had
seen
the
wear
of
centuries
they
can
not
have
been
meant
to
assist
a
climber
for
the
dwellers
of
the
cave
had
clearly
never
contemplated
this
means
of
egress
perhaps
they
had
been
used
for
some
kind
of
ceremonial
curtain
in
a
dim
past
they
were
rusty
and
frail
and
one
of
them
came
away
in
my
hand
but
for
all
that
they
marvellously
assisted
my
ascent
i
had
been
climbing
slowly
doggedly
and
carefully
my
mind
wholly
occupied
with
the
task
and
almost
before
i
knew
i
found
my
head
close
under
the
roof
of
the
cave
it
was
necessary
now
to
move
towards
the
river
and
the
task
seemed
impossible
i
could
see
no
footholds
save
two
frail
pegs
and
in
the
corner
between
the
wall
and
the
roof
was
a
rough
arch
too
wide
for
my
body
to
jam
itself
in
just
below
the
level
of
the
roof
say
two
feet
i
saw
the
submerged
spike
of
rock
the
waters
raged
around
it
and
could
not
have
been
more
than
an
inch
deep
on
the
top
if
i
could
only
get
my
foot
on
that
i
believed
i
could
avoid
being
swept
down
and
stand
up
and
reach
for
the
wall
above
the
cave
but
how
to
get
to
it
it
was
no
good
delaying
for
my
frail
holds
might
give
at
any
moment
in
any
case
i
would
have
the
moral
security
of
the
rope
so
i
passed
it
through
a
fairly
staunch
pin
close
to
the
roof
which
had
an
upward
tilt
that
almost
made
a
ring
of
it
one
end
of
the
rope
was
round
my
body
the
other
was
loose
in
my
hand
and
i
paid
it
out
as
i
moved
moral
support
is
something
very
gingerly
i
crawled
like
a
fly
along
the
wall
my
fingers
now
clutching
at
a
tiny
knob
now
clawing
at
a
crack
which
did
little
more
than
hold
my
nails
it
was
all
hopeless
insanity
and
yet
somehow
i
did
it
the
rope
and
the
nearness
of
the
roof
gave
me
confidence
and
balance
then
the
holds
ceased
altogether
a
couple
of
yards
from
the
water
i
saw
my
spike
of
rock
a
trifle
below
me
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
risk
all
on
a
jump
i
drew
the
rope
out
of
the
hitch
twined
the
slack
round
my
waist
and
leaped
for
the
spike
it
was
like
throwing
oneself
on
a
line
of
spears
the
solid
wall
of
water
hurled
me
back
and
down
but
as
i
fell
my
arms
closed
on
the
spike
there
i
hung
while
my
feet
were
towed
outwards
by
the
volume
of
the
stream
as
if
they
had
been
dead
leaves
i
was
by
the
shock
of
the
drip
on
my
head
but
i
kept
my
wits
and
presently
got
my
face
outside
the
falling
sheet
and
breathed
to
get
to
my
feet
and
stand
on
the
spike
while
all
the
fury
of
water
was
plucking
at
me
was
the
hardest
physical
effort
i
have
ever
made
it
had
to
be
done
very
circumspectly
for
a
slip
would
send
me
into
the
abyss
if
i
moved
an
arm
or
leg
an
inch
too
near
the
terrible
dropping
wall
i
knew
i
should
be
plucked
from
my
hold
i
got
my
knees
on
the
outer
face
of
the
spike
so
that
all
my
body
was
removed
as
far
as
possible
from
the
impact
of
the
water
then
i
began
to
pull
myself
slowly
up
i
could
not
do
it
if
i
got
my
feet
on
the
rock
the
effort
would
bring
me
too
far
into
the
water
and
that
meant
destruction
i
saw
this
clearly
in
a
second
while
my
wrists
were
cracking
with
the
strain
but
if
i
had
a
wall
behind
me
i
could
reach
back
with
one
hand
and
get
what
we
call
in
scotland
a
i
knew
there
was
a
wall
but
how
far
i
could
not
judge
the
perpetual
hammering
of
the
stream
had
confused
my
wits
it
was
a
horrible
moment
but
i
had
to
risk
it
i
knew
that
if
the
wall
was
too
far
back
i
should
fall
for
i
had
to
let
my
weight
go
till
my
hand
fell
on
it
delay
would
do
no
good
so
with
a
prayer
i
flung
my
right
hand
back
while
my
left
hand
clutched
the
spike
i
found
the
wall
it
was
only
a
foot
or
two
beyond
my
reach
with
a
heave
i
had
my
foot
on
the
spike
and
turning
had
both
hands
on
the
opposite
wall
there
i
stood
straddling
like
a
colossus
over
a
waste
of
white
waters
with
the
cave
floor
far
below
me
in
the
gloom
and
my
discarded
axe
lying
close
to
a
splash
of
laputa
blood
the
spectacle
made
me
giddy
and
i
had
to
move
on
or
fall
the
wall
was
not
quite
perpendicular
but
as
far
as
i
could
see
a
slope
of
about
sixty
degrees
it
was
ribbed
and
terraced
pretty
fully
but
i
could
see
no
ledge
within
reach
which
offered
standing
room
once
more
i
tried
the
moral
support
of
the
rope
and
as
well
as
i
could
dropped
a
noose
on
the
spike
which
might
hold
me
if
i
fell
then
i
boldly
embarked
on
a
hand
traverse
pulling
myself
along
a
little
ledge
till
i
was
right
in
the
angle
of
the
fall
here
happily
the
water
was
shallower
and
less
violent
and
with
my
legs
up
to
the
knees
in
foam
i
managed
to
scramble
into
a
kind
of
corner
now
at
last
i
was
on
the
wall
of
the
gully
and
above
the
cave
i
had
achieved
by
amazing
luck
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
all
mountaineering
operations
i
had
got
out
of
a
cave
to
the
wall
above
my
troubles
were
by
no
means
over
for
i
found
the
cliff
most
difficult
to
climb
the
great
rush
of
the
stream
dizzied
my
brain
the
spray
made
the
rock
damp
and
the
slope
steepened
as
i
advanced
at
one
overhang
my
shoulder
was
almost
in
the
water
again
all
this
time
i
was
climbing
doggedly
with
terror
somewhere
in
my
soul
and
hope
lighting
but
a
feeble
lamp
i
was
very
distrustful
of
my
body
for
i
knew
that
at
any
moment
my
weakness
might
return
the
fever
of
three
days
of
peril
and
stress
is
not
allayed
by
one
night
rest
by
this
time
i
was
high
enough
to
see
that
the
river
came
out
of
the
ground
about
fifty
feet
short
of
the
lip
of
the
gully
and
some
ten
feet
beyond
where
i
stood
above
the
hole
whence
the
waters
issued
was
a
loose
slope
of
slabs
and
screes
it
looked
an
ugly
place
but
there
i
must
go
for
the
i
was
on
was
getting
unclimbable
i
turned
the
corner
a
foot
or
two
above
the
water
and
stood
on
a
slope
of
about
fifty
degrees
running
from
the
parapet
of
stone
to
a
line
beyond
which
blue
sky
appeared
the
first
step
i
took
the
place
began
to
move
a
boulder
crashed
into
the
fall
and
tore
down
into
the
abyss
with
a
shattering
thunder
i
lay
flat
and
clutched
desperately
at
every
hold
but
i
had
loosened
an
avalanche
of
earth
and
not
till
my
feet
were
sprayed
by
the
water
did
i
get
a
grip
of
firm
rock
and
check
my
descent
all
this
frightened
me
horribly
with
the
kind
of
despairing
angry
fear
which
i
had
suffered
at
bruderstroom
when
i
dreamed
that
the
treasure
was
lost
i
could
not
bear
the
notion
of
death
when
i
had
won
so
far
after
that
i
advanced
not
by
steps
but
by
inches
i
felt
more
poised
and
pinnacled
in
the
void
than
when
i
had
stood
on
the
spike
of
rock
for
i
had
a
substantial
hold
neither
for
foot
nor
hand
it
seemed
weeks
before
i
made
any
progress
away
from
the
lip
of
the
waterhole
i
dared
not
look
down
but
kept
my
eyes
on
the
slope
before
me
searching
for
any
patch
of
ground
which
promised
stability
once
i
found
a
scrog
of
juniper
with
firm
roots
and
this
gave
me
a
great
lift
a
little
further
however
i
lit
on
a
bank
of
screes
which
slipped
with
me
to
the
right
and
i
lost
most
of
the
ground
the
bush
had
gained
me
my
whole
being
i
remember
was
filled
with
a
devouring
passion
to
be
quit
of
this
gully
and
all
that
was
in
it
then
not
suddenly
as
in
romances
but
after
hard
striving
and
hope
long
deferred
i
found
myself
on
a
firm
outcrop
of
weathered
stone
in
three
strides
i
was
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
then
i
began
to
run
and
at
the
same
time
to
lose
the
power
of
running
i
cast
one
look
behind
me
and
saw
a
deep
cleft
of
darkness
out
of
which
i
had
climbed
down
in
the
cave
it
had
seemed
light
enough
but
in
the
clear
sunshine
of
the
top
the
gorge
looked
a
very
pit
of
shade
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
my
life
i
had
vertigo
fear
of
falling
back
and
a
mad
craze
to
do
it
made
me
acutely
sick
i
managed
to
stumble
a
few
steps
forward
on
the
mountain
turf
and
then
flung
myself
on
my
face
when
i
raised
my
head
i
was
amazed
to
find
it
still
early
morning
the
dew
was
yet
on
the
grass
and
the
sun
was
not
far
up
the
sky
i
had
thought
that
my
entry
into
the
cave
my
time
in
it
and
my
escape
had
taken
many
hours
whereas
at
the
most
they
had
occupied
two
it
was
little
more
than
dawn
such
a
dawn
as
walks
only
on
the
hilltops
before
me
was
the
shallow
vale
with
its
bracken
and
sweet
grass
and
farther
on
the
shining
links
of
the
stream
and
the
loch
still
grey
in
the
shadow
of
the
beleaguering
hills
here
was
a
fresh
clean
land
a
land
for
homesteads
and
orchards
and
children
all
of
a
sudden
i
realized
that
at
last
i
had
come
out
of
savagery
the
burden
of
the
past
days
slipped
from
my
shoulders
i
felt
young
again
and
cheerful
and
brave
behind
me
was
the
black
night
and
the
horrid
secrets
of
darkness
before
me
was
my
own
country
for
that
loch
and
that
bracken
might
have
been
on
a
scotch
moor
the
fresh
scent
of
the
air
and
the
whole
morning
mystery
put
song
into
my
blood
i
remembered
that
i
was
not
yet
twenty
my
first
care
was
to
kneel
there
among
the
bracken
and
give
thanks
to
my
maker
who
in
very
truth
had
shown
me
goodness
in
the
land
of
the
living
after
a
little
i
went
back
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
there
where
the
road
came
out
of
the
bush
was
the
body
of
henriques
lying
sprawled
on
the
sand
with
two
dismounted
riders
looking
hard
at
it
i
gave
a
great
shout
for
in
the
men
i
recognized
aitken
and
the
schoolmaster
wardlaw
chapter
xxii
a
great
peril
and
a
great
salvation
i
must
now
take
up
some
of
the
ragged
ends
which
i
have
left
behind
me
it
is
not
my
task
as
i
have
said
to
write
the
history
of
the
great
rising
that
has
been
done
by
abler
men
who
were
at
the
centre
of
the
business
and
had
some
knowledge
of
strategy
and
tactics
whereas
i
was
only
a
raw
lad
who
was
privileged
by
fate
to
see
the
start
if
i
could
i
would
fain
make
an
epic
of
it
and
show
how
the
plains
found
at
all
points
the
plateau
guarded
how
wits
overcame
numbers
and
at
every
pass
which
the
natives
tried
the
great
guns
spoke
and
the
tide
rolled
back
yet
i
fear
it
would
be
an
epic
without
a
hero
there
was
no
leader
left
when
laputa
had
gone
there
were
months
of
guerrilla
fighting
and
then
months
of
reprisals
when
chief
after
chief
was
hunted
down
and
brought
to
trial
then
the
amnesty
came
and
a
clean
sheet
and
white
africa
drew
breath
again
with
certain
grave
reflections
left
in
her
head
on
the
whole
i
am
not
sorry
that
the
history
is
no
business
of
mine
romance
died
with
heir
of
john
and
the
crusade
became
a
sorry
mutiny
i
can
fancy
how
differently
laputa
would
have
managed
it
all
had
he
lived
how
swift
and
sudden
his
plans
would
have
been
how
under
him
the
fighting
would
not
have
been
in
the
mountain
glens
but
far
in
the
among
the
dorps
and
townships
with
the
inkulu
alive
we
warred
against
odds
with
the
inkulu
dead
the
balance
sank
heavily
in
our
favour
i
leave
to
others
the
marches
and
strategy
of
the
thing
and
hasten
to
clear
up
the
obscure
parts
in
my
own
fortunes
arcoll
received
my
message
from
umvelos
by
colin
or
rather
wardlaw
received
it
and
sent
it
on
to
the
post
on
the
berg
where
the
leader
had
gone
close
on
its
heels
came
the
message
from
henriques
by
a
shangaan
in
his
pay
it
must
have
been
sent
off
before
the
portugoose
got
to
the
rooirand
from
which
it
would
appear
that
he
had
his
own
men
in
the
bush
near
the
store
and
that
i
was
lucky
to
get
off
as
i
did
arcoll
might
have
disregarded
henriques
news
as
a
trap
if
it
had
come
alone
but
my
corroboration
impressed
and
perplexed
him
he
began
to
credit
the
portugoose
with
treachery
but
he
had
no
inclination
to
act
on
his
message
since
it
conflicted
with
his
plans
he
knew
that
laputa
must
come
into
the
berg
sooner
or
later
and
he
had
resolved
that
his
strategy
must
be
to
await
him
there
but
there
was
the
question
of
my
life
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
i
was
in
the
greatest
danger
and
he
felt
a
certain
responsibility
for
my
fate
with
the
few
men
at
his
disposal
he
could
not
hope
to
hold
up
the
great
kaffir
army
but
there
was
a
chance
that
he
might
by
a
bold
stand
effect
my
rescue
henriques
had
told
him
of
the
vow
and
had
told
him
that
laputa
would
ride
in
the
centre
of
the
force
a
body
of
men
well
posted
at
drift
might
split
the
army
at
the
crossing
and
under
cover
of
the
fire
i
might
swim
the
river
and
join
my
friends
still
relying
on
the
vow
it
might
be
possible
for
men
to
evade
capture
accordingly
he
called
for
volunteers
and
sent
off
one
of
his
kaffirs
to
warn
me
of
his
design
he
led
his
men
in
person
and
of
his
doings
the
reader
already
knows
the
tale
but
though
the
crossing
was
flung
into
confusion
and
the
rear
of
the
army
was
compelled
to
follow
the
northerly
bank
of
the
letaba
there
was
no
sign
of
me
anywhere
arcoll
searched
the
and
crossed
the
drift
to
where
the
old
keeper
was
lying
dead
he
then
concluded
that
i
had
been
murdered
early
in
the
march
and
his
kaffir
who
might
have
given
him
news
of
me
was
carried
up
the
stream
in
the
tide
of
the
disorderly
army
therefore
he
and
his
men
rode
back
with
all
haste
to
the
berg
by
way
of
main
drift
and
reached
bruderstroom
before
laputa
had
crossed
the
highway
my
information
about
inanda
kraal
decided
arcoll
next
move
like
me
he
remembered
beyers
performance
and
resolved
to
repeat
it
he
had
no
hope
of
catching
laputa
but
he
thought
that
he
might
hold
up
the
bulk
of
his
force
if
he
got
guns
on
the
ridge
above
the
kraal
a
message
had
already
been
sent
for
guns
and
the
first
to
arrive
got
to
bruderstroom
about
the
hour
when
i
was
being
taken
by
machudi
men
in
the
kloof
the
ceremony
of
the
purification
prevented
laputa
from
keeping
a
good
and
the
result
was
that
a
way
was
made
for
the
guns
on
the
corner
of
the
rampart
of
rock
it
was
the
way
which
beyers
had
taken
and
indeed
the
enterprise
was
directed
by
one
of
beyers
old
commandants
all
that
day
the
work
continued
while
laputa
and
i
were
travelling
to
machudi
then
came
the
evening
when
i
staggered
into
camp
and
told
my
news
arcoll
who
alone
knew
how
vital
laputa
was
to
the
success
of
the
insurrection
immediately
decided
to
suspend
all
other
operations
and
devote
himself
to
shepherding
the
leader
away
from
his
army
how
the
scheme
succeeded
and
what
befell
laputa
the
reader
has
already
been
told
aitken
and
wardlaw
when
i
descended
from
the
cliffs
took
me
straight
to
blaauwildebeestefontein
i
was
like
a
man
who
is
recovering
from
bad
fever
cured
but
weak
and
foolish
and
it
was
a
slow
journey
which
i
made
to
umvelos
riding
on
aitken
pony
at
umvelos
we
found
a
picket
who
had
captured
the
by
the
roadside
that
wise
beast
when
i
turned
him
loose
at
the
entrance
to
the
cave
had
trotted
quietly
back
the
way
he
had
come
at
umvelos
aitken
left
me
and
next
day
with
wardlaw
as
companion
i
rode
up
the
glen
of
the
klein
labongo
and
came
in
the
afternoon
to
my
old
home
the
store
was
empty
for
japp
some
days
before
had
gone
off
to
pietersdorp
but
there
was
zeeta
cleaning
up
the
place
as
if
war
had
never
been
heard
of
i
slept
the
night
there
and
in
the
morning
found
myself
so
much
recovered
that
i
was
eager
to
get
away
i
wanted
to
see
arcoll
about
many
things
but
mainly
about
the
treasure
in
the
cave
it
was
an
easy
journey
to
bruderstroom
through
the
meadows
of
the
plateau
the
farmers
commandoes
had
been
recalled
but
the
ashes
of
their
camp
fires
were
still
grey
among
the
bracken
i
fell
in
with
a
police
patrol
and
was
taken
by
them
to
a
spot
on
the
upper
letaba
some
miles
west
of
the
camp
where
we
found
arcoll
at
late
breakfast
i
had
resolved
to
take
him
into
my
confidence
so
i
told
him
the
full
tale
of
my
night
adventure
he
was
very
severe
with
me
i
remember
for
my
ride
but
his
severity
relaxed
before
i
had
done
with
my
story
the
telling
brought
back
the
scene
to
me
and
i
shivered
at
the
picture
of
the
cave
with
the
morning
breaking
through
the
veil
of
water
and
laputa
in
his
death
throes
arcoll
did
not
speak
for
some
time
he
is
dead
he
said
at
last
to
himself
he
was
a
king
and
died
like
a
king
our
job
now
is
simple
for
there
is
none
of
his
breed
left
in
africa
then
i
told
him
of
the
treasure
belongs
to
you
davie
he
said
we
must
see
that
you
get
it
this
is
going
to
be
a
long
war
but
if
we
survive
to
the
end
you
will
be
a
rich
man
in
the
meantime
i
asked
other
kaffirs
hear
of
it
and
come
back
and
make
a
bridge
over
the
gorge
they
may
be
doing
it
now
put
a
guard
on
it
he
said
jumping
up
briskly
maybe
not
a
soldier
job
but
you
saved
this
country
davie
and
i
going
to
make
sure
that
you
have
your
reward
after
that
i
went
with
arcoll
to
inanda
kraal
i
am
not
going
to
tell
the
story
of
that
performance
for
it
occupies
no
less
than
two
chapters
in
mr
upton
book
he
makes
one
or
two
blunders
for
he
spells
my
name
with
an
and
he
says
we
walked
out
of
the
camp
on
our
perilous
mission
faces
white
and
set
as
a
crusader
that
is
certainly
not
true
for
in
the
first
place
nobody
saw
us
go
who
could
judge
how
we
looked
and
in
the
second
place
we
were
both
smoking
and
feeling
quite
cheerful
at
home
they
made
a
great
fuss
about
it
and
started
a
newspaper
cry
about
the
victoria
cross
but
the
danger
was
not
so
terrible
after
all
and
in
any
case
it
was
nothing
to
what
i
had
been
through
in
the
past
week
i
take
credit
to
myself
for
suggesting
the
idea
by
this
time
we
had
the
army
in
the
kraal
at
our
mercy
laputa
not
having
returned
they
had
no
plans
it
had
been
the
original
intention
to
start
for
the
olifants
on
the
following
day
so
there
was
a
scanty
supply
of
food
besides
there
were
the
makings
of
a
pretty
quarrel
between
umbooni
and
some
of
the
chiefs
and
i
verily
believe
that
if
we
had
held
them
tight
there
for
a
week
they
would
have
destroyed
each
other
in
faction
fights
in
any
case
in
a
little
they
would
have
grown
desperate
and
tried
to
rush
the
approaches
on
the
north
and
south
then
we
must
either
have
used
the
guns
on
them
which
would
have
meant
a
great
slaughter
or
let
them
go
to
do
mischief
elsewhere
arcoll
was
a
merciful
man
who
had
no
love
for
butchery
besides
he
was
a
statesman
with
an
eye
to
the
future
of
the
country
after
the
war
but
it
was
his
duty
to
isolate
laputa
army
and
at
all
costs
it
must
be
prevented
from
joining
any
of
the
concentrations
in
the
south
then
i
proposed
to
him
to
do
as
rhodes
did
in
the
matoppos
and
go
and
talk
to
them
by
this
time
i
argued
the
influence
of
laputa
must
have
sunk
and
the
fervour
of
the
purification
be
the
army
had
little
food
and
no
leader
the
rank
and
file
had
never
been
fanatical
and
the
chiefs
and
indunas
must
now
be
inclined
to
sober
reflections
but
once
blood
was
shed
the
lust
of
blood
would
possess
them
our
only
chance
was
to
strike
when
their
minds
were
perplexed
and
undecided
arcoll
did
all
the
arranging
he
had
a
message
sent
to
the
chiefs
inviting
them
to
an
indaba
and
presently
word
was
brought
back
that
an
indaba
was
called
for
the
next
day
at
noon
that
same
night
we
heard
that
umbooni
and
about
twenty
of
his
men
had
managed
to
evade
our
ring
of
scouts
and
got
clear
away
to
the
south
this
was
all
to
our
advantage
as
it
removed
from
the
coming
indaba
the
most
irreconcilable
of
the
chiefs
that
indaba
was
a
queer
business
arcoll
and
i
left
our
escort
at
the
foot
of
a
ravine
and
entered
the
kraal
by
the
same
road
as
i
had
left
it
it
was
a
very
bright
hot
winter
day
and
try
as
i
might
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
think
of
any
danger
i
believed
that
in
this
way
most
temerarious
deeds
are
done
the
doer
has
become
insensible
to
danger
and
his
imagination
is
clouded
with
some
engrossing
purpose
the
first
sentries
received
us
gloomily
enough
and
closed
behind
us
as
they
had
done
when
machudi
men
haled
me
thither
then
the
job
became
eerie
for
we
had
to
walk
across
a
green
flat
with
thousands
of
eyes
watching
us
we
came
to
the
merula
tree
opposite
the
kyas
and
there
we
found
a
ring
of
chiefs
sitting
with
cocked
rifles
on
their
knees
we
were
armed
with
pistols
and
the
first
thing
arcoll
did
was
to
hand
them
to
one
of
the
chiefs
come
in
peace
he
said
give
you
our
lives
then
the
indaba
began
arcoll
leading
off
it
was
a
fine
speech
he
made
one
of
the
finest
i
have
ever
listened
to
he
asked
them
what
their
grievances
were
he
told
them
how
mighty
was
the
power
of
the
white
man
he
promised
that
what
was
unjust
should
be
remedied
if
only
they
would
speak
honestly
and
peacefully
he
harped
on
their
old
legends
and
songs
claiming
for
the
king
of
england
the
right
of
their
old
monarchs
it
was
a
fine
speech
and
yet
i
saw
that
it
did
not
convince
them
they
listened
moodily
if
attentively
and
at
the
end
there
was
a
blank
silence
arcoll
turned
to
me
god
sake
davie
he
said
to
them
about
laputa
it
our
only
chance
i
had
never
tried
speaking
before
and
though
i
talked
their
tongue
i
had
not
arcoll
gift
of
it
but
i
felt
that
a
great
cause
was
at
stake
and
i
spoke
up
as
best
i
could
i
began
by
saying
that
inkulu
had
been
my
friend
and
that
at
before
the
rising
he
had
tried
to
save
my
life
at
the
mention
of
the
name
i
saw
eyes
brighten
at
last
the
audience
was
hanging
on
my
words
i
told
them
of
henriques
and
his
treachery
i
told
them
frankly
and
fairly
of
the
doings
at
dupree
drift
i
made
no
secret
of
the
part
i
played
was
fighting
for
my
life
i
said
man
of
you
who
is
a
man
would
have
done
the
like
then
i
told
them
of
my
last
ride
and
the
sight
i
saw
at
the
foot
of
the
rooirand
i
drew
a
picture
of
henriques
lying
dead
with
a
broken
neck
and
the
inkulu
wounded
to
death
creeping
into
the
cave
in
moments
of
extremity
i
suppose
every
man
becomes
an
orator
in
that
hour
and
place
i
discovered
gifts
i
had
never
dreamed
of
arcoll
told
me
afterwards
that
i
had
spoken
like
a
man
inspired
and
by
a
fortunate
chance
had
hit
upon
the
only
way
to
move
my
hearers
i
told
of
that
last
scene
in
the
cave
when
laputa
had
broken
down
the
bridge
and
had
spoken
his
dying
words
that
he
was
the
last
king
in
africa
and
that
without
him
the
rising
was
at
an
end
then
i
told
of
his
leap
into
the
river
and
a
great
sigh
went
up
from
the
ranks
about
me
see
me
here
i
said
the
grace
of
god
i
found
a
way
up
the
fall
and
the
cliffs
which
no
man
has
ever
travelled
before
or
will
travel
again
your
king
is
dead
he
was
a
great
king
as
i
who
stand
here
bear
witness
and
you
will
never
more
see
his
like
his
last
words
were
that
the
rising
was
over
respect
that
word
my
brothers
we
come
to
you
not
in
war
but
in
peace
to
offer
a
free
pardon
and
the
redress
of
your
wrongs
if
you
fight
you
fight
with
the
certainty
of
failure
and
against
the
wish
of
the
heir
of
john
i
have
come
here
at
the
risk
of
my
life
to
tell
you
his
commands
his
spirit
approves
my
mission
think
well
before
you
defy
the
mandate
of
the
snake
and
risk
the
vengeance
of
the
terrible
ones
after
that
i
knew
that
we
had
won
the
chiefs
talked
among
themselves
in
low
whispers
casting
strange
looks
at
me
then
the
greatest
of
them
advanced
and
laid
his
rifle
at
my
feet
believe
the
word
of
a
brave
man
he
said
accept
the
mandate
of
the
snake
arcoll
now
took
command
he
arranged
for
the
disarmament
bit
by
bit
companies
of
men
being
marched
off
from
inanda
kraal
to
stations
on
the
plateau
where
their
arms
were
collected
by
our
troops
and
food
provided
for
them
for
the
full
history
i
refer
the
reader
to
mr
upton
work
it
took
many
days
and
taxed
all
our
resources
but
by
the
end
of
a
week
we
had
the
whole
of
laputa
army
in
separate
stations
under
guard
disarmed
and
awaiting
repatriation
then
arcoll
went
south
to
the
war
which
was
to
rage
around
the
swaziland
and
zululand
borders
for
many
months
while
to
aitken
and
myself
was
entrusted
the
work
of
settlement
we
had
inadequate
troops
at
our
command
and
but
for
our
prestige
and
the
weight
of
dead
hand
there
might
any
moment
have
been
a
tragedy
the
task
took
months
for
many
of
the
levies
came
from
the
far
north
and
the
job
of
feeding
troops
on
a
long
journey
was
difficult
enough
in
the
winter
season
when
the
energies
of
the
country
were
occupied
with
the
fighting
in
the
south
yet
it
was
an
experience
for
which
i
shall
ever
be
grateful
for
it
turned
me
from
a
rash
boy
into
a
serious
man
i
knew
then
the
meaning
of
the
white
man
duty
he
has
to
take
all
risks
recking
nothing
of
his
life
or
his
fortunes
and
well
content
to
find
his
reward
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
task
that
is
the
difference
between
white
and
black
the
gift
of
responsibility
the
power
of
being
in
a
little
way
a
king
and
so
long
as
we
know
this
and
practise
it
we
will
rule
not
in
africa
alone
but
wherever
there
are
dark
men
who
live
only
for
the
day
and
their
own
bellies
moreover
the
work
made
me
pitiful
and
kindly
i
learned
much
of
the
untold
grievances
of
the
natives
and
saw
something
of
their
strange
twisted
reasoning
before
we
had
got
laputa
army
back
to
their
kraals
with
food
enough
to
tide
them
over
the
spring
sowing
aitken
and
i
had
got
sounder
policy
in
our
heads
than
you
will
find
in
the
towns
where
men
sit
in
offices
and
see
the
world
through
a
mist
of
papers
by
this
time
peace
was
at
hand
and
i
went
back
to
inanda
kraal
to
look
for
colin
grave
it
was
not
a
difficult
quest
for
on
the
sward
in
front
of
the
merula
tree
they
had
buried
him
i
found
a
mason
in
the
iron
kranz
village
and
from
the
excellent
red
stone
of
the
neighbourhood
was
hewn
a
square
slab
with
an
inscription
it
ran
thus
lies
buried
the
dog
colin
who
was
killed
in
defending
crawfurd
his
master
to
him
it
was
mainly
due
that
the
kaffir
rising
failed
i
leave
those
who
have
read
my
tale
to
see
the
justice
of
the
words
chapter
xxiii
my
uncle
gift
is
many
times
multiplied
we
got
at
the
treasure
by
blowing
open
the
turnstile
it
was
easy
enough
to
trace
the
spot
in
the
rock
where
it
stood
but
the
most
patient
search
did
not
reveal
its
secret
accordingly
we
had
recourse
to
dynamite
and
soon
laid
bare
the
stone
steps
and
ascended
to
the
gallery
the
chasm
was
bridged
with
planks
and
arcoll
and
i
crossed
alone
the
cave
was
as
i
had
left
it
the
bloodstains
on
the
floor
had
grown
dark
with
time
but
the
ashes
of
the
sacramental
fire
were
still
there
to
remind
me
of
the
drama
i
had
borne
a
part
in
when
i
looked
at
the
way
i
had
escaped
my
brain
grew
dizzy
at
the
thought
of
it
i
do
not
think
that
all
the
gold
on
earth
would
have
driven
me
a
second
time
to
that
awful
escalade
as
for
arcoll
he
could
not
see
its
possibility
at
all
a
madman
could
have
done
it
he
said
blinking
his
eyes
at
the
green
linn
davie
i
think
for
about
four
days
you
were
as
mad
as
they
make
it
was
a
fortunate
thing
for
your
madness
saved
the
country
with
some
labour
we
got
the
treasure
down
to
the
path
and
took
it
under
a
strong
guard
to
pietersdorp
the
government
were
busy
with
the
settling
up
after
the
war
and
it
took
many
weeks
to
have
our
business
disposed
of
at
first
things
looked
badly
for
me
the
set
up
a
claim
to
the
whole
as
spoils
of
war
since
he
argued
it
was
the
of
the
enemy
we
had
conquered
i
do
not
know
how
the
matter
would
have
gone
on
legal
grounds
though
i
was
advised
by
my
lawyers
that
the
claim
was
a
bad
one
but
the
part
i
had
played
in
the
whole
business
more
especially
in
the
visit
to
kraal
had
made
me
a
kind
of
popular
hero
and
the
government
thought
better
of
their
first
attitude
besides
arcoll
had
great
influence
and
the
whole
story
of
my
doings
which
was
told
privately
by
him
to
some
of
the
members
of
the
government
disposed
them
to
be
generous
accordingly
they
agreed
to
treat
the
contents
of
the
cave
as
ordinary
treasure
trove
of
which
by
the
law
one
half
went
to
the
discoverer
and
one
half
to
the
crown
this
was
well
enough
so
far
as
the
gold
was
concerned
but
another
difficulty
arose
about
the
diamonds
for
a
large
part
of
these
had
obviously
been
stolen
by
labourers
from
the
mines
and
the
mining
people
laid
claim
to
them
as
stolen
goods
i
was
advised
not
to
dispute
this
claim
and
consequently
we
had
a
great
of
the
stones
in
the
presence
of
the
experts
of
the
different
mines
in
the
end
it
turned
out
that
identification
was
not
an
easy
matter
for
the
experts
quarrelled
furiously
among
themselves
a
compromise
was
at
last
come
to
and
a
division
made
and
then
the
diamond
companies
behaved
very
handsomely
voting
me
a
substantial
sum
in
recognition
of
my
services
in
recovering
their
property
what
with
this
and
with
my
half
share
of
the
gold
and
my
share
of
the
unclaimed
stones
i
found
that
i
had
a
very
considerable
fortune
the
whole
of
my
stones
i
sold
to
de
beers
for
if
i
had
placed
them
on
the
open
market
i
should
have
upset
the
delicate
equipoise
of
diamond
values
when
i
came
finally
to
cast
up
my
accounts
i
found
that
i
had
secured
a
fortune
of
a
trifle
over
a
quarter
of
a
million
pounds
the
wealth
did
not
dazzle
so
much
as
it
solemnized
me
i
had
no
impulse
to
spend
any
part
of
it
in
a
riot
of
folly
it
had
come
to
me
like
fairy
gold
out
of
the
void
it
had
been
bought
with
men
blood
almost
with
my
own
i
wanted
to
get
away
to
a
quiet
place
and
think
for
of
late
my
life
had
been
too
crowded
with
drama
and
there
comes
a
satiety
of
action
as
well
as
of
idleness
above
all
things
i
wanted
to
get
home
they
gave
me
a
great
and
sang
songs
and
good
fellows
shook
my
hand
till
it
ached
the
papers
were
full
of
me
and
there
was
a
banquet
and
speeches
but
i
could
not
relish
this
glory
as
i
ought
for
i
was
like
a
boy
thrown
violently
out
of
his
bearings
not
till
i
was
in
the
train
nearing
cape
town
did
i
recover
my
equanimity
the
burden
of
the
past
seemed
to
slip
from
me
suddenly
as
on
the
morning
when
i
had
climbed
the
linn
i
saw
my
life
all
lying
before
me
and
already
i
had
won
success
i
thought
of
my
return
to
my
own
country
my
first
sight
of
the
grey
shores
of
fife
my
visit
to
kirkcaple
my
meeting
with
my
mother
i
was
a
rich
man
now
who
could
choose
his
career
and
my
mother
need
never
again
want
for
comfort
my
money
seemed
pleasant
to
me
for
if
men
won
theirs
by
brains
or
industry
i
had
won
mine
by
sterner
methods
for
i
had
staked
against
it
my
life
i
sat
alone
in
the
railway
carriage
and
cried
with
pure
thankfulness
these
were
comforting
tears
for
they
brought
me
back
to
my
old
self
my
last
memory
of
africa
is
my
meeting
with
tam
dyke
i
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
streets
of
cape
town
and
running
after
him
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
he
stared
at
me
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
it
yourself
davie
he
cried
never
looked
to
see
you
again
in
this
world
i
do
nothing
but
read
about
you
in
the
papers
what
for
did
ye
not
send
for
me
here
have
i
been
knocking
about
inside
a
ship
and
you
have
been
getting
famous
they
tell
me
you
a
millionaire
too
i
had
tam
to
dinner
at
my
hotel
and
later
sitting
smoking
on
the
terrace
and
watching
the
among
the
aloes
i
told
him
the
better
part
of
the
story
i
have
here
written
down
davie
he
said
at
the
end
had
a
tremendous
time
here
are
you
not
eighteen
months
away
from
home
and
you
going
back
with
a
fortune
what
will
you
do
with
it
i
told
him
that
i
proposed
to
begin
with
to
finish
my
education
at
edinburgh
college
at
this
he
roared
with
laughter
a
dull
ending
anyway
it
me
that
should
have
the
money
for
i
full
of
imagination
you
were
aye
a
prosaic
body
davie
i
am
i
said
i
am
very
sure
of
one
thing
if
i
been
a
prosaic
body
i
would
be
sitting
here
two
years
later
aitken
found
the
diamond
pipe
which
he
had
always
believed
lay
in
the
mountains
some
of
the
stones
in
the
cave
being
unlike
any
ordinary
african
diamonds
confirmed
his
suspicions
and
set
him
on
the
track
a
kaffir
tribe
to
the
of
the
rooirand
had
known
of
it
but
they
had
never
worked
it
but
only
collected
the
overspill
the
closing
down
of
one
of
the
chief
existing
mines
had
created
a
shortage
of
diamonds
in
the
world
markets
and
once
again
the
position
was
the
same
as
when
kimberley
began
accordingly
he
made
a
great
fortune
and
the
aitken
proprietary
mine
is
one
of
the
most
famous
in
the
country
but
aitken
did
more
than
mine
diamonds
for
he
had
not
forgotten
the
lesson
we
had
learned
together
in
the
work
of
resettlement
he
laid
down
a
big
fund
for
the
education
and
amelioration
of
the
native
races
and
the
first
fruit
of
it
was
the
establishment
at
blaauwildebeestefontein
itself
of
a
great
native
training
college
it
was
no
factory
for
making
missionaries
and
black
teachers
but
an
institution
for
giving
the
kaffirs
the
kind
of
training
which
fits
them
to
be
good
citizens
of
the
state
there
you
will
find
every
kind
of
technical
workshop
and
the
finest
experimental
farms
where
the
blacks
are
taught
modern
agriculture
they
have
proved
themselves
apt
pupils
and
you
will
see
in
the
glens
of
the
berg
and
in
the
plains
kaffir
tillage
which
is
as
scientific
as
any
in
africa
they
have
created
a
huge
export
trade
in
tobacco
and
fruit
the
cotton
promises
well
and
there
is
talk
of
a
new
fibre
which
will
do
wonders
also
along
the
river
bottoms
the
business
is
prospering
there
are
and
baths
and
and
libraries
just
as
in
a
school
at
home
in
front
of
the
great
hall
of
the
college
a
statue
stands
the
figure
of
a
black
man
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
looking
far
over
the
plains
to
the
rooirand
on
the
pedestal
it
is
lettered
john
but
the
face
is
the
face
of
laputa
so
the
last
of
the
kings
of
africa
does
not
lack
his
monument
of
this
institution
mr
wardlaw
is
the
head
he
writes
to
me
weekly
for
i
am
one
of
the
governors
as
well
as
an
old
friend
and
from
a
recent
letter
i
take
this
passage
often
cast
my
mind
back
to
the
afternoon
when
you
and
i
sat
on
the
stoep
of
the
schoolhouse
and
talked
of
the
kaffirs
and
our
future
i
had
about
a
dozen
pupils
then
and
now
i
have
nearly
three
thousand
and
in
place
of
a
shanty
and
a
yard
i
have
a
whole
countryside
you
laughed
at
me
for
my
keenness
davie
but
i
seen
it
justified
i
was
never
a
man
of
war
like
you
and
so
i
had
to
bide
at
home
while
you
and
your
like
were
straightening
out
the
troubles
but
when
it
was
all
over
my
job
began
for
i
could
do
what
you
do
i
was
the
physician
to
heal
wounds
you
mind
how
nervous
i
was
when
i
heard
the
drums
beat
i
hear
them
every
evening
now
for
we
have
made
a
rule
that
all
the
kaffir
farms
on
the
berg
sound
a
kind
of
curfew
it
reminds
me
of
old
times
and
tells
me
that
though
it
is
peace
nowadays
we
mean
to
keep
all
the
manhood
in
them
that
they
used
to
exercise
in
war
it
would
do
your
eyes
good
to
see
the
garden
we
have
made
out
of
the
klein
labongo
glen
the
place
is
one
big
orchard
with
every
kind
of
tropical
fruit
in
it
and
the
irrigation
dam
is
as
full
of
fish
as
it
will
hold
out
at
umvelos
there
is
a
and
all
round
sikitola
we
have
square
miles
of
mealie
and
cotton
fields
the
loch
on
the
rooirand
is
stocked
with
lochleven
trout
and
we
have
made
a
up
to
it
in
a
gully
east
of
the
one
you
climbed
you
ask
about
machudi
the
last
time
i
was
there
the
place
was
white
with
sheep
for
we
have
got
the
edge
of
the
plateau
grazed
down
and
sheep
can
get
the
short
bite
there
we
have
cleaned
up
all
the
kraals
and
the
chiefs
are
members
of
our
county
council
and
are
as
fond
of
hearing
their
own
voices
as
an
aberdeen
bailie
it
a
queer
transformation
we
have
wrought
and
when
i
sit
and
smoke
my
pipe
in
the
evening
and
look
over
the
plains
and
then
at
the
big
black
statue
you
and
aitken
set
up
i
thank
the
providence
that
has
guided
me
so
far
i
hope
and
trust
that
in
the
bible
words
the
wilderness
and
the
solitary
place
are
glad
for
us
at
any
rate
it
will
not
be
my
fault
if
they
do
blossom
as
the
rose
come
out
and
visit
us
soon
man
and
see
the
work
you
had
a
hand
in
starting
i
am
thinking
seriously
of
taking
wardlaw
advice
