preface
little
demon
is
a
successful
and
almost
imperceptible
merging
of
comedy
with
tragedy
it
is
in
fact
a
tragedy
in
which
the
comic
forms
an
integral
part
and
is
not
sandwiched
in
superficially
merely
to
please
the
reader
the
method
resembles
in
a
measure
that
of
dead
souls
with
which
the
little
demon
was
compared
upon
its
first
appearance
is
a
work
of
art
and
it
is
a
challenge
and
this
challenge
is
addressed
not
to
russia
alone
but
to
the
whole
a
sad
place
russia
is
exclaimed
pushkin
when
gogol
read
his
story
to
him
but
what
the
world
knows
is
that
gogol
gave
us
a
portrait
of
the
human
soul
and
that
only
the
frame
was
russian
prince
kropotkin
assures
us
that
there
are
chichikovs
in
england
and
professor
phelps
of
yale
is
equally
emphatic
about
their
presence
in
this
is
also
true
of
peredonov
of
the
little
demon
spite
of
its
local
colour
and
its
portrayal
of
small
town
life
in
russia
this
novel
has
the
world
for
its
stage
and
its
chief
actor
peredonov
is
a
universal
character
he
is
a
russian
an
american
an
englishman
he
is
to
be
found
everywhere
and
in
every
station
of
life
both
translators
agree
that
they
have
even
met
one
or
two
peredonovs
at
london
literary
teas
and
not
a
few
volodins
for
that
there
is
a
touch
of
peredonov
in
many
men
it
is
a
matter
of
degree
for
the
extraordinary
thing
about
this
book
is
that
nearly
all
the
characters
are
peredonovs
of
a
lesser
calibre
their
peredonovism
lacks
that
concentrated
intensity
which
lifts
the
unfortunate
peredonov
to
tragic
and
to
comic
heights
in
spite
of
his
pettiness
or
perhaps
because
his
pettiness
is
so
the
little
demon
is
a
penetration
into
human
conscience
and
a
criticism
of
the
state
of
petty
provinciality
into
which
it
has
kingdom
of
god
is
within
you
so
is
the
kingdom
of
evil
that
is
the
great
truth
of
the
little
demon
and
in
peredonov
case
the
inner
spirit
takes
possession
of
external
objects
and
all
the
concrete
things
that
his
eyes
see
become
symbols
of
the
evil
that
is
within
himself
more
than
that
this
spirit
even
creates
for
him
a
little
grey
nimble
beast
the
nedotikomka
which
is
the
sum
of
the
evil
forces
of
the
world
and
against
which
he
has
to
author
enters
his
hero
condition
so
deeply
that
even
people
and
objects
and
scenery
are
rendered
as
it
were
through
eyes
and
the
mood
created
by
this
subjective
treatment
helps
to
inveigle
the
reader
into
comprehending
the
chief
beautiful
episode
relieves
the
peredonovian
atmosphere
as
a
dab
of
vermilion
relieves
grey
but
what
the
author
shows
us
is
that
even
such
an
idyllic
love
episode
is
affected
by
contact
with
this
atmosphere
and
that
its
beauty
and
innocence
become
obscured
under
the
tissue
of
lies
as
under
a
coat
of
grey
dust
this
as
well
as
other
aspects
of
the
little
demon
are
dealt
with
at
length
in
my
article
on
feodor
sologub
in
the
fortnightly
review
september
and
if
i
refrain
from
going
over
the
ground
again
it
is
because
i
hope
that
the
tale
is
simple
and
clear
enough
to
provide
its
own
i
may
be
pardoned
for
speaking
of
the
difficulties
of
translating
the
little
demon
not
only
is
the
original
extraordinarily
racy
in
parts
and
rich
in
current
russian
slang
at
times
almost
obscure
in
meaning
but
the
characters
occasionally
indulge
in
puns
or
speak
in
rhymes
is
not
uncommon
among
the
peasant
classes
in
russia
in
every
case
the
translators
have
striven
to
give
the
english
equivalent
where
the
difficulty
was
of
a
nature
rendering
this
impossible
the
translators
have
had
to
make
use
of
absolutely
unavoidable
footnotes
the
translators
have
also
made
every
effort
to
preserve
the
mood
of
sologubian
descriptive
prose
which
is
not
always
an
easy
matter
when
you
consider
the
natural
pliancy
of
russian
and
the
comparatively
rigid
nature
of
author
preface
to
the
second
russian
edition
novel
the
little
demon
was
begun
finished
originally
appeared
the
periodical
voprosi
zhizni
but
without
its
final
chapters
it
was
first
published
in
its
complete
form
in
march
the
shipovnik
are
two
dissenting
opinions
among
those
i
have
seen
expressed
in
print
as
well
as
among
those
i
have
chanced
to
hear
personally
are
some
who
think
that
the
author
being
a
very
wicked
man
wished
to
draw
his
own
portrait
and
has
represented
himself
in
the
person
of
the
instructor
peredonov
to
judge
from
his
frankness
it
would
appear
that
the
author
did
not
have
the
slightest
wish
to
justify
or
to
idealise
himself
and
has
painted
his
face
in
the
blackest
colours
he
has
accomplished
this
rather
astonishing
undertaking
in
order
to
ascend
a
kind
of
golgotha
and
to
expiate
his
sins
for
some
reason
or
other
the
result
is
an
interesting
and
harmless
because
it
shows
what
wicked
people
there
are
in
this
world
harmless
because
the
reader
can
say
this
was
not
written
about
me
more
considerate
toward
the
author
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
peredonovstchina
portrayed
in
this
novel
is
a
sufficiently
widespread
go
even
further
and
say
that
if
every
one
of
us
should
examine
himself
intently
he
would
discover
unmistakable
traits
of
these
two
opinions
i
give
preference
to
the
one
most
agreeable
to
me
namely
the
second
i
did
not
find
it
indispensable
to
create
and
invent
out
of
myself
all
that
is
episodic
realistic
and
psychologic
in
any
novel
is
based
on
very
precise
observation
and
i
found
sufficient
material
for
my
novel
around
me
and
if
my
labours
on
this
novel
have
been
rather
prolonged
it
has
been
in
order
to
elevate
to
necessity
whatever
is
here
by
chance
so
that
the
austere
ananke
should
reign
on
the
throne
of
aisa
the
prodigal
scatterer
of
is
true
that
people
love
to
be
loved
they
are
pleased
with
the
portrayal
of
the
nobler
loftier
aspects
of
the
soul
even
in
villains
they
want
to
see
a
spark
of
nobility
the
divine
spark
as
people
used
to
say
in
the
old
days
that
is
why
they
do
not
want
to
believe
the
picture
that
confronts
them
when
it
is
true
exact
gloomy
and
evil
they
say
it
is
not
about
me
my
dear
contemporaries
it
is
of
you
that
i
have
written
my
novel
about
the
little
demon
and
his
dreadful
nedotikomka
about
ardalyon
and
varvara
peredonov
pavel
volodin
darya
liudmilla
and
valeria
routilov
aleksandr
pilnikov
and
the
others
about
novel
is
a
mirror
very
skilfully
made
i
have
spent
a
long
time
in
polishing
it
i
have
laboured
over
it
surface
of
my
mirror
is
pure
it
has
been
remeasured
again
and
again
and
most
carefully
verified
it
has
not
a
single
monstrous
and
the
beautiful
are
reflected
in
it
with
equal
author
preface
to
the
fifth
russian
edition
once
thought
that
peredonov
career
was
finished
and
that
he
was
not
to
leave
the
psychiatric
hospital
where
he
was
placed
after
cutting
volodin
throat
but
latterly
rumours
have
begun
to
reach
me
to
the
effect
that
peredonov
mental
derangement
has
proved
to
be
only
temporary
and
that
after
a
brief
confinement
he
was
restored
to
freedom
these
rumours
sound
hardly
plausible
i
only
mention
them
because
even
in
our
days
the
unplausible
happens
indeed
i
have
read
in
a
newspaper
that
i
am
preparing
to
write
a
sequel
to
the
little
demon
have
heard
that
varvara
has
apparently
succeeded
in
convincing
someone
that
peredonov
had
cause
for
behaving
as
he
did
that
volodin
uttered
more
than
once
objectionable
words
and
had
betrayed
objectionable
intentions
and
that
before
his
death
he
said
something
amazingly
insolent
which
led
to
the
fatal
catastrophe
i
am
told
that
varvara
has
interested
the
princess
volchanskaya
in
this
story
and
the
princess
who
earlier
had
neglected
to
put
in
a
word
for
peredonov
is
now
taking
a
keen
interest
in
his
to
what
happened
to
peredonov
after
he
had
left
the
hospital
my
information
is
rather
vague
and
contradictory
some
people
have
told
me
that
peredonov
has
entered
the
police
department
as
he
had
been
advised
to
do
by
skouchayev
and
has
served
as
a
councillor
in
the
district
government
he
has
distinguished
himself
in
some
way
or
other
and
is
making
a
fine
have
heard
from
others
however
that
it
was
not
ardalyon
borisitch
who
served
in
the
police
but
another
peredonov
a
relative
of
our
peredonov
ardalyon
borisitch
himself
did
not
succeed
in
entering
the
service
or
else
he
did
not
wish
to
instead
he
has
taken
up
with
literary
criticism
his
articles
reveal
those
qualities
which
distinguished
him
rumour
strikes
me
as
being
even
more
unlikely
than
the
any
case
if
i
should
succeed
in
receiving
precise
information
about
the
latest
doings
of
peredonov
i
will
try
to
relate
it
in
all
its
adequate
dialogue
to
the
seventh
russian
edition
may
soul
why
are
you
thus
dismayed
of
the
hate
that
surrounds
the
name
of
the
author
of
little
demon
many
people
who
disagree
upon
other
things
are
agreed
on
the
malice
and
the
abuse
is
not
our
labour
worthy
of
gratitude
why
then
this
hate
hate
is
rather
like
fear
you
waken
the
conscience
too
loudly
you
are
too
frank
is
there
some
use
in
my
truth
want
compliments
but
this
is
not
paris
no
it
is
not
paris
soul
you
are
a
true
parisienne
a
child
of
european
civilisation
you
have
come
in
a
charming
dress
and
in
light
sandals
to
a
place
where
they
wear
smocks
and
greased
boots
do
not
be
astonished
if
the
greased
boot
sometimes
steps
rudely
on
your
tender
foot
its
possessor
is
an
honest
fellow
what
a
morose
what
an
awkward
fellow
author
introduction
to
the
english
edition
is
quite
natural
for
the
author
of
a
novel
to
experience
pleasure
and
pride
upon
learning
that
his
work
is
about
to
become
accessible
to
a
new
circle
of
readers
upon
learning
however
that
john
cournos
was
translating
my
novel
little
demon
into
english
i
experienced
not
a
little
apprehension
in
days
of
rapprochement
in
days
of
great
stress
when
a
common
danger
unites
the
two
great
nations
it
seemed
to
me
perhaps
unseasonable
to
acquaint
england
with
this
sombre
picture
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
was
a
danger
of
my
new
readers
accepting
this
novel
as
a
precise
and
characteristic
portrayal
of
russian
life
but
my
friends
told
me
that
john
cournos
was
fulfilling
his
task
with
great
love
and
this
gives
me
the
hope
that
the
true
meaning
of
my
work
will
be
also
understood
in
the
translation
reproducing
so
accurately
the
any
case
i
should
like
to
warn
my
readers
against
the
temptation
of
seeing
only
russian
traits
in
this
novel
the
portrait
of
peredonov
is
an
expression
of
the
inclination
towards
evil
of
the
almost
disinterested
tendency
of
a
perverse
human
soul
to
depart
from
the
common
course
of
universal
life
directed
by
one
omnipotent
will
and
taking
vengeance
upon
the
world
for
its
own
grievous
loneliness
to
bring
into
the
world
evil
and
abomination
to
mutilate
the
given
reality
and
to
defile
the
beautiful
dreams
of
inclination
towards
evil
raging
in
the
hearts
of
mankind
in
all
latitudes
and
longitudes
invests
itself
only
outwardly
with
an
appearance
of
selfish
expedience
a
soul
marred
by
this
tragic
affliction
that
of
a
morose
separation
from
the
world
is
borne
along
by
a
sovereign
justice
which
rules
worlds
and
hearts
upon
disastrous
paths
towards
madness
and
towards
afflicted
soul
does
not
rejoice
at
its
gains
to
such
a
degree
visionary
to
such
a
degree
worthless
a
foreboding
of
ultimate
destruction
torments
it
with
a
gnawing
then
in
what
blessed
land
is
not
man
tormented
with
this
agonising
sadness
these
true
tokens
of
the
same
morose
and
sombre
affliction
the
russian
khandra
and
the
english
spleen
are
the
expression
of
one
and
the
same
malady
of
the
spirit
even
in
more
noble
souls
these
harsh
visitors
so
familiar
to
both
englishmen
and
russians
have
been
created
by
the
omnipotent
will
not
without
a
beneficent
design
they
incessantly
remind
the
soul
succumbing
in
the
life
struggle
that
the
enemy
is
near
cunning
and
would
be
glad
if
my
new
readers
should
appraise
not
only
the
detestable
sinfulness
and
perversity
of
a
soul
warped
by
the
force
of
evil
but
also
the
great
yearning
of
this
soul
the
evil
evil
atones
to
a
certain
degree
in
this
truly
human
feeling
and
in
this
feeling
the
afflicted
man
also
communes
with
each
one
of
novel
will
not
be
accepted
by
you
in
condemnation
of
my
country
my
country
has
not
a
few
enchantments
which
make
her
beloved
not
only
by
her
own
but
also
by
the
observant
stranger
perhaps
the
attentive
reader
will
find
even
in
this
sombre
novel
certain
reflections
of
enchanting
russian
nature
and
of
the
live
russian
chapter
i
after
mass
the
members
of
the
congregation
scattered
to
their
homes
a
few
stopped
to
talk
under
the
old
maples
and
lindens
near
the
white
stone
walls
within
the
enclosure
all
were
in
holiday
dress
and
looked
at
one
another
cheerily
it
appeared
as
if
the
inhabitants
of
this
town
lived
peacefully
and
amicably
even
happily
but
it
was
only
in
appearance
peredonov
a
schoolmaster
in
the
stood
among
his
friends
and
as
he
looked
at
them
gravely
out
of
his
small
stealthy
eyes
across
the
golden
rims
of
his
spectacles
he
remarked
princess
volchanskaya
herself
made
the
promise
to
vara
soon
she
said
you
marry
him
i
hunt
up
an
inspector
job
for
him
but
how
can
you
think
of
marrying
varvara
dmitrievna
asked
the
falastov
she
your
first
cousin
everyone
laughed
peredonov
usually
rosy
unconcerned
somnolent
face
showed
anger
second
cousin
he
said
gruffly
as
he
looked
angrily
past
his
companions
did
the
princess
give
you
the
promise
herself
asked
routilov
a
tall
pale
smartly
dressed
man
she
did
give
it
to
me
but
to
vara
answered
peredonov
of
course
you
are
ready
to
believe
all
she
tells
you
said
routilov
with
animation
it
easy
enough
to
make
up
a
tale
why
did
you
see
the
princess
herself
this
is
how
it
was
i
went
with
vara
but
we
did
find
her
in
missed
her
by
just
five
minutes
explained
peredonov
she
had
gone
to
the
country
and
would
be
back
for
three
weeks
or
so
i
wait
for
her
because
i
had
to
be
back
here
for
the
exams
it
sounds
suspicious
laughed
routilov
showing
his
yellow
teeth
peredonov
grew
thoughtful
his
companions
left
him
routilov
alone
remained
of
course
said
peredonov
i
can
marry
whom
i
like
varvara
is
not
the
only
one
you
quite
right
ardalyon
borisitch
anyone
would
be
glad
to
marry
you
routilov
encouraged
him
they
passed
out
of
the
gate
and
walked
slowly
in
the
unpaved
and
dusty
square
peredonov
said
but
what
about
the
princess
she
be
angry
if
i
chuck
varvara
what
the
princess
to
you
said
routilov
you
not
going
with
her
to
a
kitten
christening
she
ought
to
get
you
the
billet
first
there
be
time
enough
to
tie
yourself
up
you
taking
things
too
much
on
trust
that
true
agreed
peredonov
irresolutely
you
ought
to
say
to
varvara
said
routilov
persuasively
the
billet
my
dear
girl
then
i
believe
you
once
you
get
your
place
you
can
marry
whom
you
like
you
better
take
one
of
my
sisters
your
choice
of
the
three
smart
educated
young
ladies
any
one
of
them
i
can
say
without
flattery
a
queen
to
varvara
she
not
fit
to
tie
their
go
on
shouted
peredonov
it
true
what
your
varvara
here
smell
this
routilov
bent
down
broke
off
a
fleecy
stalk
of
henbane
crumpled
it
up
in
his
hand
together
with
the
leaves
and
dirty
white
flowers
and
crushing
it
all
between
his
fingers
put
it
under
peredonov
nose
the
heavy
unpleasant
odour
made
peredonov
frown
routilov
observed
to
crush
like
this
and
to
throw
away
there
your
varvara
for
you
there
a
big
difference
between
her
and
my
sisters
let
me
tell
you
my
good
fellow
they
are
fine
lively
girls
take
the
one
you
like
but
you
need
be
afraid
of
getting
bored
with
any
of
them
they
quite
young
too
the
eldest
is
three
times
younger
than
your
varvara
routilov
said
all
this
in
his
usual
brisk
and
happy
manner
smiling
but
he
was
tall
and
and
seemed
consumptive
and
frail
while
from
under
his
new
and
fashionable
hat
his
scant
bright
hair
stuck
out
pitifully
no
less
than
three
times
observed
peredonov
dryly
as
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
began
to
wipe
them
it
true
enough
exclaimed
routilov
but
you
better
look
out
and
do
be
slow
about
it
while
i
alive
they
too
have
a
good
opinion
of
themselves
if
you
try
later
you
may
be
too
late
any
one
of
them
would
have
you
with
great
pleasure
yes
everyone
falls
in
love
with
me
here
said
peredonov
with
a
grave
boastfulness
there
you
see
it
for
you
to
take
advantage
of
the
moment
said
routilov
persuasively
the
chief
thing
is
that
she
must
be
lean
said
peredonov
with
anxiety
in
his
voice
i
prefer
a
fat
one
do
you
worry
on
that
account
said
routilov
warmly
even
now
they
are
plump
enough
girls
but
they
have
far
from
reached
their
full
growth
all
this
will
come
in
good
time
as
soon
as
they
marry
improve
like
the
oldest
well
you
seen
our
larissa
a
regular
fishpie
i
marry
said
peredonov
but
i
afraid
that
vara
will
make
a
row
if
you
afraid
of
a
row
i
tell
you
what
you
ought
to
do
said
routilov
with
a
sly
smile
you
ought
to
make
quick
work
of
it
marry
say
or
and
suddenly
show
up
at
home
with
your
young
wife
say
the
word
and
i
arrange
it
for
evening
which
one
do
you
want
peredonov
suddenly
burst
into
loud
cackling
laughter
well
i
see
you
like
the
idea
it
all
settled
then
asked
routilov
peredonov
stopped
laughing
quite
as
suddenly
and
said
gravely
quietly
almost
in
a
whisper
she
inform
against
me
that
miserable
jade
she
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
routilov
persuasively
or
she
poison
me
whispered
peredonov
in
fear
you
leave
it
all
to
me
routilov
prevailed
upon
him
i
see
that
you
are
well
protected
i
sha
marry
without
a
said
peredonov
sullenly
routilov
was
not
astonished
by
the
new
turn
in
the
thoughts
of
his
surly
companion
he
replied
with
the
same
warmth
you
an
odd
fellow
of
course
my
sisters
have
a
are
you
satisfied
i
run
along
now
and
arrange
everything
only
keep
your
mouth
shut
not
a
breath
do
you
hear
not
to
anyone
he
shook
peredonov
hand
and
made
off
in
great
haste
peredonov
looked
silently
after
him
a
picture
rose
up
in
his
mind
of
the
routilov
girls
always
cheerful
and
laughing
an
immodest
thought
squeezed
a
degrading
likeness
of
a
smile
to
his
lips
it
appeared
for
an
instant
and
vanished
a
confused
restlessness
stirred
within
him
what
about
the
princess
he
reflected
the
others
have
the
cash
without
her
power
but
if
i
marry
varvara
i
fall
into
an
job
and
later
perhaps
they
make
me
a
he
looked
after
the
bustling
scampering
routilov
and
thought
maliciously
let
him
run
and
this
thought
gave
him
a
lingering
vague
pleasure
then
he
began
to
feel
sad
because
he
was
alone
he
pulled
his
hat
down
over
his
forehead
knitted
his
bright
eyebrows
and
quickly
turned
towards
his
home
across
the
unpaved
deserted
streets
overgrown
with
pearl
grass
and
white
flowers
and
and
grass
that
had
been
stamped
down
into
the
mud
someone
called
to
him
in
a
quick
quiet
voice
ardalyon
borisitch
come
in
to
us
peredonov
raised
his
gloomy
eyes
and
looked
angrily
beyond
the
hedge
in
the
garden
behind
the
gate
stood
natalya
afanasyevna
vershina
a
small
slender
woman
and
and
all
in
black
she
was
smoking
a
cigarette
in
a
dark
mouthpiece
and
smiling
lightly
as
though
she
knew
something
that
was
not
to
be
said
but
to
be
smiled
at
not
so
much
by
words
as
by
her
light
quick
movements
she
asked
peredonov
into
her
garden
she
opened
the
gate
and
stood
aside
smiled
invitingly
and
at
the
same
time
motioned
persuasively
with
her
hands
as
if
to
say
enter
why
do
you
stand
there
and
peredonov
entered
submitting
to
her
witching
silent
movements
but
he
soon
paused
on
the
sand
path
where
a
few
broken
twigs
caught
his
eye
and
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
time
for
lunch
he
grumbled
though
his
watch
had
served
him
a
long
time
yet
even
now
in
the
presence
of
people
he
would
glance
with
satisfaction
at
its
large
gold
case
it
was
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
peredonov
decided
that
he
would
remain
for
a
short
time
he
walked
morosely
after
vershina
along
the
past
the
neglected
clumps
of
raspberry
canes
and
currants
with
their
red
and
black
clusters
the
garden
was
growing
yellow
and
variegated
with
fruits
and
late
flowers
there
were
many
fruit
and
other
trees
and
bushes
apple
trees
pear
trees
lindens
cherry
trees
with
smooth
glossy
leaves
plum
trees
and
honeysuckle
the
elderberry
trees
were
red
with
berries
close
to
the
fence
was
a
dense
growth
of
siberian
geraniums
small
flowers
with
purple
veins
thorny
purple
buds
stood
out
with
intense
vividness
among
the
bushes
a
small
grey
wooden
house
stood
near
by
and
a
path
at
its
door
opened
out
wide
into
the
garden
it
seemed
charming
and
cosy
a
part
of
the
vegetable
garden
was
visible
behind
it
the
dry
poppy
heads
rocked
there
as
well
as
the
large
caps
of
camomile
the
yellow
heads
of
sunflowers
were
beginning
to
droop
with
ripeness
while
among
the
useful
herbs
some
hemlock
lifted
its
white
and
the
hemlock
geranium
its
pale
purple
umbrellas
here
bright
yellow
buttercups
and
small
slipper
flowers
also
flourished
were
you
at
mass
asked
vershina
yes
i
was
answered
peredonov
gruffly
i
hear
marta
has
just
returned
also
said
vershina
she
often
goes
to
our
church
i
often
laugh
at
her
whose
account
i
say
to
her
you
go
to
our
church
she
blushes
and
says
nothing
let
us
go
and
sit
in
the
she
added
abruptly
in
the
garden
in
the
shade
of
the
spreading
maples
stood
an
old
grey
little
it
had
three
small
steps
and
a
mossy
floor
low
walls
six
posts
a
sloping
slate
roof
with
six
angles
marta
was
sitting
in
the
still
in
her
best
clothes
she
had
on
a
brightly
coloured
dress
with
bows
which
were
very
unbecoming
to
her
her
short
sleeves
showed
her
sharp
red
elbows
and
her
large
red
hands
in
other
respects
marta
was
not
unpleasant
to
look
at
her
freckles
did
not
spoil
her
face
she
was
even
considered
something
of
a
beauty
especially
by
her
own
people
the
poles
of
whom
there
were
a
number
in
the
district
marta
was
rolling
cigarettes
for
vershina
she
was
very
anxious
for
peredonov
to
see
her
and
admire
her
this
desire
gave
her
ingenuous
face
an
expression
of
agitated
affability
it
was
not
that
marta
was
altogether
in
love
with
peredonov
but
rather
that
vershina
wanted
to
get
her
a
home
for
her
family
was
a
large
one
marta
was
anxious
to
please
vershina
with
whom
she
had
lived
several
months
ever
since
the
death
of
vershina
old
husband
not
only
on
her
own
account
but
on
that
of
her
young
brother
a
schoolboy
who
was
also
living
with
vershina
vershina
and
peredonov
entered
the
peredonov
greeted
marta
rather
gloomily
and
sat
down
he
chose
a
place
where
one
of
the
posts
protected
his
back
from
the
wind
and
kept
the
draught
out
of
his
ears
he
glanced
at
marta
yellow
boots
with
their
rose
pompoms
and
thought
that
they
were
trying
to
entrap
him
into
marrying
marta
he
always
thought
this
when
he
met
girls
who
were
pleasant
to
him
he
only
noticed
faults
in
marta
many
freckles
large
hands
and
a
coarse
skin
he
knew
that
her
father
held
a
small
farm
on
lease
about
six
versts
from
the
town
the
income
was
small
and
there
were
many
children
marta
had
left
her
preparatory
school
his
son
was
at
school
the
other
children
were
still
smaller
let
me
give
you
some
beer
said
vershina
quickly
there
were
some
glasses
two
bottles
of
beer
and
a
tin
box
of
granulated
sugar
on
the
table
and
a
spoon
which
had
been
dipped
in
the
beer
lay
beside
them
all
right
said
peredonov
abruptly
vershina
glanced
at
marta
who
filled
the
glass
and
handed
it
to
peredonov
a
smile
passed
over
her
face
as
she
did
this
put
some
sugar
into
the
beer
suggested
vershina
marta
passed
peredonov
the
tin
but
peredonov
exclaimed
irritatedly
no
sugar
makes
it
disgusting
what
do
you
mean
said
vershina
sugar
makes
it
delicious
very
delicious
said
marta
i
say
disgusting
repeated
peredonov
looking
angrily
at
the
sugar
as
you
please
said
vershina
and
changing
the
subject
at
once
she
remarked
with
a
laugh
i
get
very
tired
of
cherepnin
marta
also
laughed
peredonov
looked
indifferent
he
did
not
take
any
interest
in
other
people
lives
he
did
not
care
for
people
and
he
never
thought
of
them
except
as
they
might
contribute
to
his
own
benefit
and
pleasure
vershina
smiled
with
and
said
he
thinks
that
i
will
marry
him
he
very
cheeky
said
marta
not
because
she
thought
so
but
because
she
wished
to
please
and
flatter
vershina
last
night
he
looked
into
our
window
related
vershina
he
got
into
the
garden
while
we
were
at
supper
there
was
a
under
the
window
full
of
water
it
was
covered
with
a
plank
the
water
was
hidden
he
climbed
on
the
tub
and
looked
in
the
window
as
the
lamp
on
the
table
was
lighted
he
could
see
us
but
we
could
see
him
suddenly
we
heard
a
noise
we
were
frightened
at
first
and
ran
outside
the
plank
had
slipped
and
he
had
fallen
into
the
water
however
he
climbed
out
before
we
got
there
and
ran
away
leaving
wet
tracks
on
the
path
we
recognised
him
by
his
back
marta
laughed
shrilly
and
happily
like
a
child
vershina
told
this
in
her
usual
quick
monotonous
voice
and
then
was
suddenly
silent
and
smiled
at
the
corners
of
her
mouth
which
puckered
up
her
smooth
dry
face
the
teeth
showed
themselves
slightly
peredonov
reflected
a
moment
and
suddenly
burst
into
a
laugh
he
did
not
always
respond
at
once
to
what
he
thought
was
funny
his
receptivity
was
sluggish
and
dull
vershina
smoked
one
cigarette
after
another
she
could
not
live
without
tobacco
smoke
under
her
nose
we
soon
be
neighbours
announced
peredonov
vershina
glanced
quickly
at
marta
who
flushed
slightly
and
looked
at
peredonov
with
a
timorous
air
of
expectation
and
then
at
once
turned
away
towards
the
garden
so
you
moving
asked
vershina
why
it
too
far
from
the
explained
peredonov
vershina
smiled
incredulously
it
more
likely
she
thought
he
wants
to
be
nearer
marta
but
you
lived
there
for
several
years
she
said
yes
said
peredonov
angrily
and
the
landlady
a
swine
why
asked
vershina
with
an
ambiguous
smile
peredonov
grew
somewhat
animated
she
repapered
the
rooms
most
damnably
he
exclaimed
one
piece
does
match
another
when
you
open
the
door
you
find
quite
another
pattern
most
of
the
room
has
bunches
of
large
and
small
flowers
while
behind
the
door
there
is
a
pattern
of
stripes
and
nails
and
the
colours
are
different
too
we
should
have
noticed
it
if
falastov
had
not
come
and
laughed
and
everybody
laughs
at
it
it
certainly
must
be
ridiculous
agreed
vershina
we
not
telling
her
that
we
going
to
leave
said
peredonov
and
at
this
he
lowered
his
voice
we
going
to
find
new
apartments
and
we
shall
go
without
giving
notice
of
course
said
vershina
or
else
she
make
a
row
said
peredonov
with
a
touch
of
anxiety
in
his
eyes
that
means
that
we
should
have
to
pay
her
a
month
rent
for
her
beastly
hole
peredonov
laughed
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
leaving
the
house
without
paying
she
bound
to
make
a
demand
observed
vershina
let
her
she
wo
get
anything
out
of
me
replied
peredonov
angrily
we
went
to
peter
and
we
made
no
use
of
the
house
while
we
were
away
but
you
had
rented
it
what
then
she
ought
to
make
a
discount
why
should
we
have
to
pay
for
time
when
we
were
there
besides
she
is
very
impertinent
well
your
landlady
is
impertinent
because
she
yours
your
cousin
is
particularly
quarrelsome
said
vershina
with
an
emphasis
on
the
cousin
peredonov
frowned
and
looked
dully
in
front
of
him
with
his
eyes
vershina
changed
the
subject
peredonov
pulled
a
caramel
out
of
his
pocket
tore
the
paper
off
and
began
to
chew
it
he
happened
to
glance
at
marta
and
thought
that
she
wanted
a
caramel
shall
i
give
her
one
or
not
thought
peredonov
she
not
worth
it
i
suppose
i
ought
to
give
her
one
to
show
that
i
not
stingy
after
all
i
got
a
pocketful
and
he
pulled
out
a
handful
of
caramels
here
you
are
he
said
and
held
out
the
sweets
first
to
vershina
and
then
to
marta
they
very
good
bonbons
he
said
expensive
ones
thirty
kopecks
a
pound
each
of
the
women
took
a
sweet
take
more
he
said
i
lots
of
them
they
very
nice
bonbons
i
would
eat
bad
ones
thank
you
i
do
want
any
more
said
vershina
in
her
quick
monotonous
voice
and
marta
repeated
after
her
the
same
words
but
with
less
decision
peredonov
glanced
incredulously
at
marta
and
said
what
do
you
mean
you
do
want
them
have
another
he
took
a
single
caramel
for
himself
from
the
handful
and
laid
the
others
before
marta
she
smiled
without
speaking
and
bent
her
head
a
little
little
idiot
thought
peredonov
she
does
even
know
how
to
thank
one
properly
he
did
not
know
what
to
converse
about
with
marta
she
had
no
interest
for
him
like
all
objects
and
people
with
which
he
had
no
relations
either
pleasant
or
unpleasant
the
rest
of
the
beer
was
poured
into
peredonov
glass
vershina
glanced
at
marta
i
get
it
said
marta
she
always
guessed
what
vershina
wanted
without
being
told
send
vladya
he
in
the
garden
suggested
vershina
vladislav
shouted
marta
yes
answered
the
boy
from
so
close
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
been
listening
to
them
bring
some
more
beer
two
bottles
said
marta
they
in
the
box
in
the
corridor
vladislav
soon
came
back
noiselessly
handed
the
beer
to
marta
through
the
window
and
greeted
peredonov
how
are
you
asked
peredonov
with
a
scowl
how
many
bottles
of
beer
have
you
got
away
with
vladislav
smiled
in
a
constrained
way
and
said
i
do
drink
beer
he
was
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
with
a
freckled
face
like
marta
and
with
uneasy
clumsy
movements
like
hers
he
was
dressed
in
a
blouse
of
coarse
linen
marta
began
to
talk
to
her
brother
in
whispers
they
both
laughed
peredonov
looked
suspiciously
at
them
whenever
people
laughed
in
his
presence
without
his
knowing
the
reason
he
always
supposed
that
they
were
laughing
at
him
vershina
felt
disturbed
and
tried
to
catch
marta
eye
but
peredonov
himself
showed
his
annoyance
by
asking
what
are
you
laughing
at
marta
started
and
turned
towards
him
not
knowing
what
to
say
vladislav
smiled
looking
at
peredonov
and
flushed
slightly
it
very
rude
said
peredonov
to
laugh
like
that
before
guests
were
you
laughing
at
me
marta
blushed
and
vladislav
looked
frightened
oh
no
said
marta
we
were
laughing
at
you
we
were
talking
about
our
own
affairs
a
secret
exclaimed
peredonov
angrily
it
is
rude
to
discuss
secrets
before
guests
it
is
at
all
a
secret
said
marta
but
we
laughed
because
vladya
has
all
his
clothes
on
and
feels
bashful
about
coming
in
peredonov
was
mollified
and
began
to
think
of
jokes
about
vladya
and
presently
gave
him
a
caramel
marta
bring
me
my
black
shawl
said
vershina
and
at
the
same
time
look
into
the
oven
to
see
how
that
pie
getting
on
marta
went
out
obediently
she
understood
that
vershina
wanted
to
talk
with
peredonov
and
felt
glad
of
the
respite
and
you
run
away
and
play
vladya
said
vershina
there
nothing
for
you
to
chatter
about
here
vladya
ran
off
and
they
could
hear
the
sand
crunching
under
his
feet
vershina
gave
a
quick
cautious
at
peredonov
through
the
clouds
of
cigarette
smoke
she
was
ceaselessly
puffing
out
peredonov
sat
solemnly
and
gazed
straight
in
front
in
a
befogged
sort
of
way
and
chewed
a
caramel
he
felt
pleased
because
the
others
had
gone
otherwise
they
might
have
laughed
again
though
he
was
quite
certain
that
they
had
not
been
laughing
at
him
the
annoyance
remained
just
as
after
contact
with
stinging
nettles
the
pain
remains
and
increases
even
though
the
nettles
are
left
behind
why
do
you
get
married
said
vershina
very
abruptly
what
are
you
waiting
for
ardalyon
borisitch
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
speak
frankly
but
varvara
is
not
good
enough
for
you
peredonov
passed
his
hand
over
his
slightly
ruffled
hair
and
announced
with
a
surly
dignity
there
is
no
one
here
good
enough
for
me
do
say
that
replied
vershina
with
a
wry
smile
there
are
plenty
of
girls
better
than
she
is
here
and
every
one
of
them
would
marry
you
she
knocked
the
ash
off
her
cigarette
with
a
decisive
movement
as
if
she
were
emphasising
her
remark
with
an
exclamation
point
everyone
would
suit
me
retorted
peredonov
we
not
discussing
everyone
said
vershina
quickly
you
not
the
kind
of
man
who
run
after
a
if
the
girl
were
a
fine
girl
you
yourself
earn
quite
enough
thank
god
no
replied
peredonov
it
would
be
more
of
an
advantage
for
me
to
marry
varvara
the
princess
has
promised
her
patronage
she
will
give
me
a
good
billet
he
went
on
with
grave
animation
vershina
smiled
faintly
her
entire
wrinkled
face
dark
as
if
saturated
with
tobacco
smoke
expressed
a
condescending
incredulousness
she
asked
did
the
princess
herself
tell
this
she
laid
an
emphasis
on
the
word
you
not
me
but
varvara
admitted
peredonov
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
you
rely
too
much
on
your
cousin
word
said
vershina
spitefully
but
tell
me
is
she
much
older
than
you
say
by
fifteen
years
or
more
she
must
be
under
fifty
nonsense
said
peredonov
angrily
she
not
yet
thirty
vershina
laughed
please
tell
me
she
said
with
unconcealed
derision
surely
she
looks
much
older
than
you
of
course
it
not
my
business
it
not
my
affair
still
it
is
a
pity
that
such
a
clever
young
man
should
not
have
the
position
he
deserves
peredonov
surveyed
himself
with
great
but
there
was
no
smile
on
his
pink
face
and
he
seemed
hurt
because
everybody
did
not
appreciate
him
as
vershina
did
even
without
patronage
you
go
far
continued
vershina
surely
the
authorities
will
recognise
your
value
why
should
you
hang
on
to
varvara
and
none
even
of
the
routilov
girls
would
suit
you
too
frivolous
and
you
need
a
more
practical
wife
you
might
do
much
worse
than
marry
marta
peredonov
looked
at
his
watch
time
to
go
home
he
observed
and
rose
to
say
vershina
was
convinced
that
peredonov
was
leaving
because
she
had
put
to
him
a
vital
question
and
that
it
was
only
his
indecision
that
prevented
him
from
speaking
about
marta
immediately
petersburg
chapter
ii
varvara
dmitrievna
maloshina
the
mistress
of
peredonov
awaited
him
she
was
dressed
in
a
slovenly
fashion
and
her
face
was
powdered
and
rouged
jam
tarts
were
being
baked
in
the
oven
for
lunch
peredonov
was
very
fond
of
them
varvara
ran
about
the
kitchen
on
her
high
heels
preparing
everything
for
peredonov
arrival
varvara
was
afraid
that
natalya
the
stout
freckled
would
steal
one
of
the
tarts
and
possibly
more
that
was
why
varvara
did
not
leave
the
kitchen
and
as
she
habitually
did
was
abusing
the
servant
upon
her
wrinkled
face
which
still
kept
the
remains
of
beauty
there
was
a
continual
expression
of
discontented
maliciousness
a
feeling
of
gloom
and
irritation
came
over
peredonov
as
always
happened
when
he
returned
home
he
entered
the
noisily
flung
his
hat
on
the
sat
down
at
the
table
and
shouted
vara
where
my
food
varvara
brought
in
the
food
skilfully
limping
in
her
narrow
fashionable
shoes
and
waited
upon
peredonov
herself
when
she
brought
the
coffee
peredonov
bent
down
to
the
steaming
glass
and
smelt
it
varvara
was
disturbed
and
looked
a
little
frightened
she
asked
what
the
matter
with
you
ardalyon
borisitch
does
the
coffee
smell
of
anything
peredonov
looked
morosely
at
her
and
said
i
smelling
to
see
whether
you
have
put
poison
in
it
what
the
matter
with
you
ardalyon
borisitch
said
varvara
again
god
help
you
how
did
you
get
that
into
your
head
you
mixed
hemlock
with
it
perhaps
he
grumbled
what
could
i
gain
by
poisoning
you
asked
varvara
reassuringly
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
peredonov
continued
smelling
the
coffee
but
eventually
became
reassured
if
it
were
poison
he
said
you
be
able
to
tell
by
the
heavy
smell
but
you
have
to
put
your
nose
right
into
the
steam
he
was
silent
a
while
and
then
suddenly
said
spitefully
and
sarcastically
the
princess
varvara
looked
distressed
what
about
the
princess
asked
varvara
the
princess
he
said
let
her
give
me
the
job
first
and
then
get
married
you
write
her
that
but
you
know
ardalyon
borisitch
varvara
began
in
a
persuasive
voice
that
the
princess
had
made
her
promise
on
condition
that
i
marry
first
otherwise
it
is
awkward
for
me
to
ask
on
your
behalf
write
her
that
we
already
married
said
peredonov
rejoicing
in
his
sudden
inspiration
varvara
was
for
a
moment
disconcerted
but
quickly
recovered
herself
and
said
what
the
use
of
lying
the
princess
might
investigate
you
better
arrange
the
date
for
the
marriage
it
time
to
begin
making
the
dress
what
dress
demanded
peredonov
gruffly
could
anyone
get
married
in
these
rags
shouted
varvara
you
had
better
give
me
some
money
ardalyon
borisitch
for
the
dress
are
you
preparing
yourself
for
your
coffin
asked
peredonov
you
a
beast
ardalyon
borisitch
peredonov
suddenly
felt
a
desire
to
provoke
her
still
further
he
asked
her
varvara
do
you
know
where
i
been
where
she
inquired
anxiously
at
vershina
he
said
and
burst
out
laughing
well
you
were
in
nice
company
i
must
say
i
saw
marta
peredonov
continued
she
covered
with
freckles
said
varvara
spitefully
and
she
got
a
mouth
that
stretches
from
ear
to
ear
you
might
as
well
sew
up
her
mouth
like
a
frog
anyway
she
handsomer
than
you
said
peredonov
i
think
i
take
her
and
marry
her
you
dare
marry
her
shouted
varvara
reddening
and
trembling
with
rage
and
i
burn
her
eyes
out
with
vitriol
i
like
to
spit
on
you
said
peredonov
quite
calmly
just
try
it
said
varvara
well
i
will
answered
peredonov
he
rose
and
with
a
sluggish
and
indifferent
expression
spat
in
her
face
pig
said
varvara
as
quietly
as
if
his
spitting
on
her
had
refreshed
her
and
she
began
to
wipe
her
face
with
a
table
napkin
peredonov
was
silent
latterly
he
had
been
more
brusque
with
her
than
usual
and
even
in
the
beginning
he
had
never
been
particularly
gentle
with
her
encouraged
by
his
silence
she
repeated
more
loudly
pig
you
are
a
pig
just
then
they
heard
in
the
next
room
the
bleating
of
an
almost
voice
do
make
such
a
noise
said
peredonov
there
someone
coming
it
only
pavloushka
answered
varvara
pavel
vassilyevitch
volodin
entered
with
a
loud
gay
laugh
he
was
a
young
man
who
face
manners
and
all
strangely
resembled
a
young
ram
his
hair
like
a
ram
was
curly
his
eyes
protruding
and
dull
everything
about
him
in
fact
suggested
a
lively
ram
a
stupid
young
man
he
was
a
carpenter
by
trade
he
had
first
studied
in
a
manual
training
school
but
now
was
an
instructor
of
the
trade
in
the
local
school
how
are
you
old
friend
he
said
gaily
you
at
home
drinking
coffee
and
here
am
i
here
we
are
together
again
natashka
bring
a
third
spoon
shouted
varvara
eat
pavloushka
said
peredonov
and
it
was
evident
that
he
was
anxious
to
be
hospitable
to
volodin
you
know
old
chap
i
shall
soon
get
an
inspector
billet
the
princess
has
promised
vara
volodin
seemed
pleased
and
laughed
and
the
future
inspector
is
drinking
coffee
he
exclaimed
slapping
peredonov
on
the
back
and
you
think
it
easy
to
get
an
inspector
job
said
peredonov
once
you
reported
that
the
end
of
you
and
who
going
to
report
you
asked
varvara
there
are
plenty
to
do
that
said
peredonov
they
might
say
i
been
reading
pisarev
and
there
you
are
but
ardalyon
borisitch
you
ought
to
put
pisarev
behind
your
other
books
advised
volodin
sniggering
peredonov
glanced
cautiously
at
volodin
and
said
perhaps
i
never
even
had
pisarev
wo
you
have
a
drink
pavloushka
volodin
stuck
out
his
lower
lip
and
made
a
significant
face
like
a
man
who
was
conscious
of
his
own
value
and
bent
his
head
rather
like
a
ram
i
always
ready
to
drink
in
company
he
said
but
not
on
my
lonesome
and
peredonov
was
also
always
ready
to
drink
they
drank
their
vodka
and
ate
the
jam
tarts
afterwards
suddenly
peredonov
splashed
the
dregs
of
his
on
the
volodin
goggled
his
sheepish
eyes
and
gazed
in
astonishment
the
was
soiled
and
torn
volodin
asked
what
are
you
doing
to
your
peredonov
and
varvara
laughed
it
to
spite
the
landlady
said
varvara
we
leaving
soon
only
do
you
chatter
splendid
shouted
volodin
and
joined
in
the
laughter
peredonov
walked
up
to
the
wall
and
began
to
wipe
the
soles
of
his
boots
on
it
volodin
followed
his
example
peredonov
said
we
always
dirty
the
walls
after
every
meal
so
that
they
remember
us
when
we
gone
what
a
mess
you
made
exclaimed
volodin
delightedly
wo
irishka
be
surprised
said
varvara
with
a
dry
malicious
laugh
and
all
three
standing
before
the
wall
began
to
spit
at
it
to
tear
the
paper
and
to
smear
it
with
their
boots
afterwards
tired
but
pleased
they
ceased
peredonov
bent
down
and
picked
up
the
cat
a
fat
white
ugly
beast
he
began
to
torment
the
animal
pulling
its
ears
and
tail
and
then
shook
it
by
the
neck
volodin
laughed
gleefully
and
suggested
other
methods
of
tormenting
the
animal
ardalyon
borisitch
blow
into
his
eyes
brush
his
fur
backwards
the
cat
snarled
and
tried
to
get
away
but
dared
not
show
its
claws
it
was
always
thrashed
for
scratching
at
last
this
amusement
palled
on
peredonov
and
he
let
the
cat
go
listen
ardalyon
borisitch
i
got
something
to
tell
you
began
volodin
i
kept
thinking
of
it
all
the
way
here
and
now
i
almost
forgotten
it
well
asked
peredonov
i
know
you
like
sweet
things
said
volodin
and
i
know
one
that
will
make
you
lick
your
fingers
there
nothing
you
could
teach
me
about
things
to
eat
remarked
peredonov
volodin
looked
offended
perhaps
he
said
you
know
all
the
good
things
that
are
made
in
your
village
but
how
can
you
know
all
the
good
things
that
are
made
in
my
village
if
you
never
been
there
and
satisfied
that
this
argument
clinched
the
matter
volodin
laughed
like
a
sheep
bleating
in
your
village
they
gorge
themselves
on
dead
cats
said
peredonov
permit
me
ardalyon
borisitch
said
volodin
it
is
possible
that
in
your
village
they
eat
dead
kittens
we
wo
talk
about
it
but
surely
you
never
eaten
no
that
true
confessed
peredonov
what
sort
of
food
is
that
asked
varvara
it
this
explained
volodin
you
know
what
is
well
who
does
know
said
varvara
well
this
is
what
it
is
went
on
volodin
ground
raisins
sugar
and
almonds
that
and
volodin
began
to
describe
minutely
how
they
cook
in
his
village
peredonov
listened
to
him
in
an
annoyed
way
thought
peredonov
why
does
he
mention
that
does
he
want
me
to
be
dead
volodin
suggested
if
you
like
to
have
it
done
properly
give
me
the
stuff
and
cook
it
myself
for
you
turn
a
goat
into
a
vegetable
garden
said
peredonov
gravely
he
might
drop
some
into
it
thought
peredonov
volodin
was
offended
again
now
if
you
think
ardalyon
borisitch
that
i
shall
steal
some
of
your
sugar
you
mistaken
i
do
want
your
sugar
do
go
on
making
a
fool
of
yourself
interrupted
varvara
you
know
how
particular
he
is
you
better
come
here
and
do
it
yes
and
you
have
to
eat
it
yourself
said
peredonov
why
asked
volodin
his
voice
trembling
with
indignation
because
it
nasty
stuff
as
you
like
ardalyon
borisitch
said
volodin
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
only
wanted
to
please
you
and
if
you
do
want
it
you
do
want
it
now
tell
us
about
the
reprimand
the
general
gave
you
said
peredonov
what
general
asked
volodin
and
flushed
violently
as
he
protruded
an
offended
lower
lip
it
no
use
pretending
we
heard
it
said
peredonov
varvara
grinned
excuse
me
ardalyon
borisitch
said
volodin
hotly
likely
enough
you
heard
about
it
but
you
have
heard
the
right
story
now
tell
you
exactly
what
happened
fire
away
said
peredonov
it
happened
three
days
ago
about
this
time
began
volodin
in
our
school
as
you
know
repairs
are
going
on
in
the
workroom
and
here
if
you
please
comes
in
veriga
with
our
inspector
to
look
around
and
we
are
working
in
the
back
room
so
far
good
it
does
matter
what
veriga
wanted
or
why
he
came
that
no
concern
of
mine
suppose
he
is
a
nobleman
still
he
no
connection
with
our
school
but
that
no
concern
of
mine
he
comes
in
and
we
do
take
any
notice
of
him
and
go
on
working
when
suddenly
they
come
into
our
room
and
veriga
if
you
please
has
his
hat
on
that
was
an
insult
to
you
said
peredonov
but
you
must
know
interrupted
volodin
eagerly
there
an
ikon
in
our
room
and
we
had
our
hats
off
and
he
suddenly
appears
like
a
mohammedan
dog
and
i
up
and
said
to
him
quietly
and
with
great
dignity
excellency
i
say
to
him
you
be
good
enough
to
take
your
hat
off
because
i
say
to
him
an
ikon
in
the
room
now
was
that
the
right
thing
to
say
asked
volodin
opening
his
eyes
questioningly
that
was
clever
pavloushka
shouted
peredonov
he
got
what
he
deserved
yes
that
was
quite
proper
chimed
in
varvara
people
like
that
should
be
let
off
you
a
smart
young
fellow
pavel
vassilyevitch
volodin
with
an
air
of
injured
innocence
went
on
and
then
he
says
to
me
to
his
trade
then
he
turns
and
goes
out
that
all
there
was
to
it
and
nothing
else
volodin
nevertheless
felt
himself
a
hero
peredonov
to
mollify
him
gave
him
a
caramel
a
new
visitor
arrived
sofya
efimovna
prepolovenskaya
the
wife
of
the
forester
a
fat
woman
with
a
face
half
half
cunning
brisk
in
her
movements
she
sat
down
at
the
table
and
asked
volodin
slyly
pavel
vassilyevitch
why
do
you
come
so
often
to
visit
varvara
dmitrievna
i
do
come
to
visit
varvara
dmitrievna
answered
volodin
bashfully
but
to
see
ardalyon
borisitch
you
have
yet
fallen
in
love
with
anyone
asked
prepolovenskaya
with
a
laugh
everyone
knew
volodin
was
looking
for
a
wife
with
a
dowry
offered
himself
to
many
and
was
always
rejected
prepolovenskaya
joke
seemed
to
him
out
of
place
in
a
manner
resembling
that
of
an
injured
sheep
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
if
i
fell
in
love
sofya
efimovna
that
would
concern
anyone
except
my
own
self
and
her
and
in
such
an
affair
you
would
be
considered
but
prepolovenskaya
refused
to
be
suppressed
suppose
she
said
that
you
fell
in
love
with
varvara
dmitrievna
who
would
make
jam
tarts
for
ardalyon
borisitch
volodin
again
protruded
his
lips
and
lifted
his
eyebrows
he
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
do
be
pavel
vassilyevitch
prepolovenskaya
went
on
why
are
you
engaged
you
young
and
handsome
perhaps
varvara
dmitrievna
would
have
me
said
volodin
sniggering
why
should
she
you
much
too
timid
and
perhaps
i
would
have
her
said
volodin
in
desperation
perhaps
i
do
want
to
marry
other
people
cousins
perhaps
i
have
a
cousin
of
my
own
in
my
village
he
was
already
beginning
to
believe
that
varvara
would
marry
him
varvara
was
angry
she
considered
volodin
a
fool
and
moreover
his
wages
were
only
of
peredonov
prepolovenskaya
wanted
to
marry
peredonov
to
her
sister
the
fat
daughter
of
a
priest
that
is
why
she
tried
to
create
a
quarrel
between
peredonov
and
varvara
why
are
you
trying
to
marry
us
asked
varvara
in
an
irritated
way
you
better
try
to
marry
your
little
fool
of
a
sister
to
pavel
vassilyevitch
why
should
i
take
him
from
you
said
prepolovenskaya
jokingly
prepolovenskaya
jests
gave
a
new
turn
to
peredonov
slow
thoughts
and
the
had
already
taken
possession
of
his
mind
why
did
volodin
advise
such
a
dish
peredonov
disliked
thinking
he
believed
at
once
everything
he
was
told
that
was
why
he
began
to
believe
that
volodin
was
in
love
with
varvara
he
thought
they
would
entangle
varvara
and
then
when
he
left
for
the
inspector
job
they
would
poison
him
on
the
way
with
and
volodin
would
take
his
place
he
would
be
buried
as
volodin
and
volodin
would
become
inspector
a
clever
trick
there
was
a
sudden
noise
in
the
passage
peredonov
and
varvara
were
frightened
peredonov
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
door
varvara
crept
up
to
the
parlour
door
looked
in
then
just
as
quietly
on
balancing
her
arms
and
smiling
in
a
distracted
way
returned
to
the
table
from
the
passage
came
a
noise
and
shrill
outcries
as
if
two
people
were
wrestling
varvara
whispered
that
ershova
frightfully
drunk
natashka
wo
let
her
in
and
trying
to
get
into
the
parlour
what
shall
we
do
asked
peredonov
fearfully
i
suppose
we
better
go
into
the
parlour
decided
varvara
so
that
she
sha
get
in
here
they
entered
the
parlour
and
closed
the
door
tightly
behind
them
varvara
went
into
the
passage
in
the
faint
hope
of
restraining
the
landlady
or
of
persuading
her
to
sit
down
in
the
kitchen
but
the
insolent
woman
kept
pushing
her
way
in
propped
herself
up
against
the
and
poured
out
abusive
compliments
on
the
whole
company
peredonov
and
varvara
fussed
about
her
and
tried
to
make
her
sit
down
on
a
chair
near
the
passage
and
farther
from
the
varvara
brought
her
from
the
kitchen
on
a
tray
vodka
beer
and
some
tarts
but
the
landlady
would
not
sit
nor
drink
anything
and
kept
on
edging
towards
the
but
she
could
not
exactly
find
the
door
her
face
was
red
her
clothes
were
disordered
she
was
filthy
and
smelt
of
vodka
even
at
a
distance
she
shouted
no
you
must
let
me
sit
at
your
own
table
i
not
have
it
on
a
tray
i
want
it
on
a
tablecloth
i
the
landlady
and
i
will
be
respected
never
mind
if
i
drunk
i
at
least
honest
and
a
good
wife
to
my
husband
varvara
smiling
at
once
with
contempt
and
fear
said
yes
we
know
ershova
winked
at
varvara
laughed
hoarsely
and
snapped
her
fingers
defiantly
she
became
more
and
more
arrogant
cousin
she
shouted
we
know
the
sort
of
cousin
you
are
why
the
wife
come
to
see
you
eh
do
make
so
much
noise
said
varvara
but
ershova
began
to
shout
even
louder
how
dare
you
order
me
about
i
in
my
own
house
and
i
can
do
what
i
please
if
i
like
i
can
have
you
thrown
out
so
that
there
not
even
be
a
smell
of
you
left
behind
only
i
too
meanwhile
volodin
and
prepolovenskaya
sat
timidly
at
the
window
in
silence
prepolovenskaya
smiled
slightly
looking
at
the
shrew
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
but
pretended
that
she
was
looking
into
the
street
volodin
sat
with
an
injured
expression
on
his
face
ershova
eventually
became
more
and
gave
varvara
a
friendly
slap
on
the
shoulder
saying
with
a
drunken
smile
now
listen
to
me
put
me
at
your
table
and
treat
me
like
a
lady
then
give
me
some
and
treat
your
landlady
decently
come
my
dear
girl
here

some
tarts
said
varvara
i
do
want
tarts
shouted
ershova
i
want
some
and
she
waved
her
hands
the
masters
have
them
and
i
want
some
too
i
have
any
for
you
answered
varvara
growing
bolder
as
the
landlady
became
more
now
here
some
tarts
gorge
yourself
ershova
suddenly
perceived
the
door
into
the
and
cried
out
furiously
out
of
my
way
viper
she
pushed
varvara
aside
and
threw
herself
towards
the
door
there
was
no
time
to
restrain
her
lowering
her
head
and
clenching
her
fists
she
broke
into
the
throwing
back
the
door
with
a
crash
there
she
paused
just
inside
the
door
and
saw
the
soiled
she
uttered
a
long
whew
of
astonishment
she
stood
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
her
legs
crossed
shouting
with
rage
then
it
true
that
you
leaving
who
put
that
into
your
head
irinya
stepanovna
said
varvara
trembling
we
no
such
idea
someone
been
fooling
you
we
not
going
anywhere
declared
peredonov
we
quite
contented
here
the
landlady
did
not
listen
to
them
she
walked
up
to
the
varvara
and
shook
her
fist
in
her
face
peredonov
got
behind
varvara
he
would
have
run
away
but
he
wanted
to
see
if
varvara
and
the
landlady
would
come
to
blows
i
will
step
on
one
of
your
legs
exclaimed
the
landlady
furiously
and
tear
you
in
half
with
the
other
be
quiet
irinya
stepanovna
said
varvara
persuasively
we
have
visitors
you
can
bring
your
visitors
along
too
said
the
landlady
i
do
the
same
to
them
she
reeled
and
made
a
dash
into
the
parlour
and
suddenly
changing
her
demeanour
and
tactics
she
said
quietly
to
prepolovenskaya
bowing
so
low
before
her
that
she
almost
fell
on
the
floor
my
dear
lady
sofya
efimovna
forgive
a
drunken
old
woman
i
have
something
i
like
to
say
to
you

come
to
visit
these
people
and
yet
you
do
know
that
they
gossiping
about
your
sister
and
who
to
suppose
me
a
bootmaker
drunken
wife
and
why
so
i
tell
everyone
that
why
varvara
grew
purple
in
the
face
and
said
i
said
nothing
of
the
sort
you
did
do
you
mean
to
deny
it
you
mean
cat
shouted
ershova
coming
up
to
varvara
with
clenched
fists
be
quiet
will
you
muttered
varvara
in
confusion
no
said
the
landlady
spitefully
i
wo
be
quiet
and
she
turned
again
to
prepolovenskaya
do
you
know
what
she
says
the
little
beast
she
tried
to
make
out
that
your
sister
is
carrying
on
with
your
husband
sofya
sly
eyes
gleamed
angrily
at
varvara
she
rose
and
said
with
a
feigned
laugh
thank
you
humbly
i
did
expect
that
liar
screamed
varvara
turning
on
ershova
ershova
gave
an
angry
exclamation
stamped
her
foot
shook
her
hand
at
varvara
and
turned
again
to
prepolovenskaya
yes
and
do
you
know
what
he
says
about
you
he
makes
out
that
you
carried
on
before
you
met
your
husband
that
the
sort
of
dirty
people
they
are
spit
in
their
mugs
my
good
lady
it
no
use
having
anything
to
do
with
such
low
creatures
prepolovenskaya
flushed
and
went
silently
into
the
passage
peredonov
ran
after
her
trying
to
explain
she
lying
do
believe
her
i
only
said
once
before
her
that
you
were
a
fool
and
that
was
in
a
spiteful
mood
but
more
than
that
honest
to
god
i
never
said
anything
she
invented
it
prepolovenskaya
reassured
him
do
think
about
it
ardalyon
borisitch
i
can
see
myself
that
drunk
and
babbling
only
why
do
you
permit
this
in
your
house
well
what
to
be
done
with
her
asked
peredonov
prepolovenskaya
confused
and
angry
was
putting
on
her
jacket
peredonov
did
not
offer
to
help
her
he
kept
on
mumbling
excuses
but
she
paid
no
attention
to
him
he
returned
to
the
parlour
ershova
began
to
reproach
him
loudly
while
varvara
ran
out
on
the
verandah
to
try
and
mollify
prepolovenskaya
you
know
yourself
what
a
fool
he
is
he
sometimes
says
anything
that
comes
into
his
head
all
right
all
right
do
mention
it
replied
prepolovenskaya
a
drunken
woman
might
babble
anything
tall
dense
nettles
grew
in
the
yard
near
the
verandah
prepolovenskaya
smiled
slightly
and
the
last
shadow
of
displeasure
vanished
from
her
plump
white
face
she
became
affable
again
towards
varvara
she
would
be
revenged
without
an
open
quarrel
together
they
went
into
the
garden
to
wait
until
the
landlady
eruption
was
over
prepolovenskaya
kept
looking
at
the
nettles
which
grew
in
abundance
along
the
garden
fence
she
said
at
last
you
have
enough
nettles
here
do
you
find
any
use
for
them
varvara
laughed
and
answered
what
an
idea
what
could
i
do
with
them
if
you
do
mind
i
like
to
take
some
with
me
as
i
have
any
what
will
you
do
with
them
asked
varvara
in
astonishment
oh
i
find
a
use
for
them
said
prepolovenskaya
smiling
but
my
dear
do
tell
me
for
what
entreated
varvara
inquisitively
prepolovenskaya
bending
towards
varvara
whispered
in
her
ear
by
rubbing
your
body
with
nettles
you
keep
fat
that
why
my
genichka
is
so
plump
it
was
well
known
that
peredonov
preferred
fat
women
and
that
he
detested
thin
ones
varvara
was
distressed
because
she
was
thin
and
was
growing
still
thinner
how
could
she
get
a
little
plumper
was
one
of
her
chief
worries
she
used
to
ask
everyone
do
you
know
any
remedy
for
thinness
and
now
prepolovenskaya
was
convinced
that
varvara
would
follow
her
suggestion
and
rub
herself
with
nettles
and
in
this
way
be
her
own
punisher
pisarev
a
revolutionary
writer
and
a
precursor
of
nihilism
a
kind
of
rice
pudding
eaten
at
funerals
in
russia
an
apparently
invented
word
meaning
something
particularly
nice
to
eat
chapter
iii
peredonov
and
ershova
went
out
into
the
open
he
growled
come
this
way
she
shouted
with
all
her
might
though
gaily
they
were
apparently
getting
ready
to
dance
prepolovenskaya
and
varvara
passed
through
the
kitchen
into
another
room
where
they
sat
down
at
the
window
to
see
what
would
happen
peredonov
and
ershova
embraced
each
other
and
began
to
dance
around
the
pear
tree
peredonov
face
remained
dull
as
before
and
did
not
express
anything
mechanically
as
upon
an
automaton
his
spectacles
sprang
up
and
down
his
nose
and
his
hair
flopped
up
and
down
on
his
head
ershova
screamed
shouted
waved
her
arms
and
at
times
reeled
she
shouted
to
varvara
whom
she
espied
at
the
window
hey
you
do
be
such
a
lady
come
out
and
dance
are
you
disgusted
with
our
company
varvara
turned
away
the
deuce
take
you
i
dead
tired
shouted
ershova
and
fell
back
on
the
grass
drawing
down
peredonov
with
her
they
sat
a
while
in
each
other
embrace
then
got
up
and
once
more
began
to
dance
this
they
repeated
several
times
now
they
danced
now
they
rested
under
the
pear
tree
upon
the
bench
or
simply
on
the
grass
volodin
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
as
he
watched
the
dancers
from
the
window
he
roared
with
laughter
made
extraordinarily
funny
faces
and
bent
his
body
in
two
he
shouted
they
cracked
how
funny
accursed
carrion
said
varvara
angrily
yes
carrion
agreed
volodin
with
a
grin
just
wait
my
dear
landlady
i
show
you
something
let
go
and
make
a
mess
in
the
parlour
too
she
wo
come
back
again
anyhow
she
tire
herself
out
and
go
home
to
sleep
he
burst
into
his
bleating
laughter
and
jumped
about
like
a
great
ram
prepolovenskaya
encouraged
him
yes
go
ahead
pavel
vassilyevitch
and
make
a
mess
we
do
care
a
rap
for
her
if
she
does
come
back
we
can
tell
her
that
she
did
it
herself
when
she
was
drunk
volodin
skipping
and
laughing
ran
into
the
parlour
and
began
to
smear
and
rub
his
boots
on
the
varvara
dmitrievna
get
me
a
piece
of
rope
he
shouted
varvara
waddling
like
a
duck
passed
through
the
parlour
into
the
bedroom
and
brought
back
with
her
a
piece
of
frayed
knotted
rope
volodin
made
a
noose
then
stood
up
on
a
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
hung
the
noose
on
the
that
for
the
landlady
he
explained
so
that
when
you
leave
have
somewhere
to
hang
herself
in
her
rage
both
women
squealed
with
laughter
now
get
me
a
bit
of
paper
and
a
pencil
shouted
volodin
varvara
searched
in
the
bedroom
and
discovered
a
pencil
and
a
piece
of
paper
volodin
wrote
on
it
for
the
landlady
and
pinned
the
paper
on
the
noose
he
made
ridiculous
grimaces
all
the
time
he
was
doing
this
then
he
began
to
jump
furiously
up
and
down
along
the
walls
kicking
them
every
now
and
again
with
his
boots
shaking
with
laughter
at
the
same
time
his
squeals
and
bleating
laughter
filled
the
whole
house
the
white
cat
putting
back
its
ears
in
terror
peered
out
of
the
bedroom
and
seemed
undecided
where
to
run
peredonov
at
last
managed
to
disengage
himself
from
ershova
and
returned
to
the
house
ershova
really
did
get
tired
and
went
home
to
bed
volodin
met
peredonov
with
uproarious
laughter
we
made
a
mess
of
the
parlour
too
hurrah
hurrah
shouted
peredonov
bursting
into
a
loud
abrupt
laugh
the
women
also
cried
hurrah
and
a
general
gaiety
set
in
peredonov
cried
pavloushka
let
dance
yes
let
ardalyosha
replied
volodin
with
a
stupid
grin
they
danced
under
the
noose
and
kicked
up
their
legs
awkwardly
the
floor
trembled
under
peredonov
heavy
feet
ardalyon
borisitch
got
a
dancing
fit
said
prepolovenskaya
with
a
smile
that
nothing
new
he
has
his
little
whims
grumbled
varvara
looking
admiringly
at
peredonov
nevertheless
she
sincerely
thought
that
he
was
handsome
and
clever
his
most
stupid
actions
seemed
to
her
perfectly
fitting
to
her
he
was
neither
ridiculous
nor
repulsive
let
sing
a
funeral
mass
over
the
landlady
shouted
volodin
fetch
a
pillow
here
what
will
they
think
of
next
said
varvara
laughingly
she
threw
out
from
the
bedroom
a
pillow
in
a
dirty
calico
slip
they
put
the
pillow
on
the
floor
to
represent
the
landlady
and
began
to
chant
over
it
with
wild
discordant
voices
then
they
called
in
natalya
and
made
her
turn
the
ariston
all
four
of
them
began
to
dance
a
quadrille
with
strange
antics
kicking
up
their
legs
after
the
dance
peredonov
felt
generous
a
dim
morose
sort
of
animation
lit
up
his
plump
face
he
was
inspired
by
a
sudden
almost
automatic
decision
a
consequence
perhaps
of
his
sudden
muscular
action
he
pulled
out
his
wallet
counted
several
notes
and
with
a
proud
expression
threw
them
towards
varvara
here
you
are
varvara
he
exclaimed
get
yourself
a
wedding
dress
the
notes
fluttered
across
the
floor
varvara
eagerly
picked
them
up
she
was
not
in
the
least
offended
at
the
way
the
gift
was
made
prepolovenskaya
thought
well
we
shall
see
who
going
to
have
him
and
she
smiled
maliciously
volodin
of
course
did
not
think
of
helping
varvara
to
pick
up
the
money
soon
prepolovenskaya
left
in
the
passage
she
met
another
visitor
grushina
marya
ossipovna
grushina
was
a
young
widow
with
a
prematurely
faded
appearance
she
was
thin
her
dry
skin
was
covered
with
small
wrinkles
which
looked
filled
with
dust
her
face
was
not
unpleasant
but
her
teeth
were
black
and
unbrushed
she
had
long
hands
long
grasping
fingers
and
dirty
at
the
first
glance
she
not
only
looked
dirty
but
gave
the
impression
that
she
and
her
clothes
had
been
beaten
together
it
really
looked
as
if
a
column
of
dust
would
rise
up
into
the
sky
if
she
were
struck
several
times
with
a
carpet
beater
her
clothes
hung
upon
her
in
crumpled
folds
she
might
have
been
just
released
from
a
bundle
grushina
lived
on
a
pension
on
petty
commissions
and
by
lending
money
on
mortgages
her
conversation
was
mostly
on
immodest
lines
and
she
attached
herself
to
men
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
second
husband
one
of
her
rooms
was
always
let
to
some
one
among
the
bachelor
officials
varvara
was
pleased
to
see
grushina
she
had
something
to
tell
her
they
began
to
talk
immediately
about
the
in
whispers
the
inquisitive
volodin
edged
closer
to
them
and
listened
peredonov
sat
morosely
by
himself
in
front
of
the
table
crumpling
the
corner
of
the
tablecloth
in
his
fingers
varvara
was
complaining
to
grushina
about
natalya
grushina
suggested
a
new
servant
klavdia
and
praised
her
they
decided
to
go
after
her
at
once
to
samorodina
where
she
was
living
in
the
house
of
an
excise
officer
who
had
just
been
transferred
to
another
town
varvara
paused
when
she
heard
the
maid
name
and
asked
in
a
doubtful
voice
klavdia
what
on
earth
shall
i
call
her
klashka
why
do
you
call
her
klavdiushka
suggested
grushina
this
pleased
varvara
klavdiushka
diushka
she
said
with
a
crackling
laugh
it
should
be
observed
that
in
our
town
a
pig
is
called
a
diushka
volodin
grunted
everyone
laughed
diushka
diushenka
lisped
volodin
between
the
laughter
screwing
up
his
stupid
face
and
protruding
his
underlip
and
he
kept
on
grunting
and
making
a
fool
of
himself
until
he
was
told
that
he
was
a
nuisance
then
he
left
his
chair
with
an
expression
of
injury
on
his
face
and
sat
down
beside
peredonov
he
lowered
his
large
forehead
like
a
ram
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
spot
on
the
soiled
tablecloth
on
the
way
to
samorodina
varvara
decided
that
she
would
buy
the
material
for
her
wedding
dress
she
always
went
shopping
with
grushina
who
helped
her
to
make
selections
and
to
bargain
unseen
by
peredonov
varvara
had
stealthily
stuffed
grushina
deep
pockets
with
sweets
and
tarts
and
other
gifts
for
her
children
grushina
surmised
that
varvara
was
in
great
need
of
her
services
varvara
narrow
shoes
would
not
allow
her
to
walk
much
she
quickly
became
fatigued
it
was
for
this
reason
that
she
usually
took
a
cab
though
the
distances
in
our
town
are
not
great
latterly
she
had
frequented
grushina
house
the
cabbies
had
noticed
this
for
there
were
only
about
a
score
of
them
when
varvara
entered
a
cab
they
never
asked
her
where
she
wanted
to
go
they
seated
themselves
in
a
drozhky
and
were
driven
to
the
house
where
klavdia
was
in
order
to
make
inquiries
about
her
the
streets
were
dirty
almost
everywhere
although
it
had
rained
only
the
day
before
the
drozhky
no
sooner
rattled
on
to
a
solid
paved
part
of
the
road
than
it
plunged
again
into
the
clinging
mud
of
the
unpaved
sections
but
by
way
of
compensation
varvara
voice
rattled
on
continuously
now
and
then
accompanied
by
grushina
sympathetic
chatter
my
goose
has
been
to
marfushka
again
said
varvara
grushina
answered
in
a
sympathetic
outburst
that
how
they
trying
to
catch
him
and
why
not
he
be
a
great
catch
especially
for
marfushka
she
never
dreamt
of
anyone
like
him
really
i
do
know
what
to
do
confessed
varvara
he
become
so
obstinate
lately
it
simply
awful
believe
me
my
head
in
a
constant
whirl
he
really
marry
and
then
there
nothing
for
me
but
the
streets
do
worry
darling
varvara
said
grushina
consolingly
do
think
about
it
he
never
marry
anyone
but
you
he
used
to
you
he
sometimes
goes
off
in
the
evening
and
i
ca
get
to
sleep
afterwards
said
varvara
who
knows
perhaps
he
courting
some
girl
sometimes
i
toss
about
all
night
everyone
has
her
eye
on
him
even
those
three
routilov
mares
of
women
but
of
course
they
hang
around
any
man
neck
and
that
fat
zhenka
after
him
too
varvara
went
on
complaining
for
a
long
time
and
all
her
conversation
led
grushina
to
think
that
varvara
had
some
favour
to
ask
of
her
and
she
was
gratified
at
the
prospect
of
a
reward
klavdia
pleased
varvara
the
excise
officer
wife
strongly
recommended
her
they
engaged
her
and
told
her
to
come
that
evening
as
the
excise
officer
was
leaving
at
once
at
last
they
came
to
grushina
house
grushina
lived
in
her
own
house
in
a
slovenly
enough
fashion
the
three
children
were
bedraggled
dirty
stupid
and
malicious
like
dogs
that
have
just
come
out
of
water
their
confidences
were
just
beginning
my
fool
ardalyosha
began
varvara
wants
me
to
write
to
the
princess
again
it
a
waste
of
time
to
write
to
her
she
either
not
answer
or
she
answer
unsatisfactorily
we
not
on
very
intimate
terms
the
princess
volchanskaya
with
whom
varvara
had
lived
in
the
past
as
a
seamstress
for
simple
domestic
things
could
have
helped
peredonov
since
her
daughter
was
married
to
the
stchepkin
who
held
an
important
position
in
the
department
of
education
she
had
already
written
in
answer
to
varvara
petitions
in
the
past
year
that
she
could
not
ask
anything
for
varvara
fiancé
but
she
might
for
her
husband
if
the
opportunity
offered
this
letter
did
not
satisfy
peredonov
since
it
expressed
merely
a
vague
hope
and
did
not
definitely
state
that
the
princess
would
actually
find
husband
an
inspector
position
in
order
to
clear
up
this
doubt
they
had
lately
gone
to
petersburg
varvara
went
to
the
princess
and
later
she
took
peredonov
with
her
but
purposely
delayed
the
visit
so
that
they
did
not
find
the
princess
at
home
varvara
realised
that
at
best
the
princess
would
merely
have
advised
them
to
get
married
soon
making
a
few
vague
promises
which
would
not
have
satisfied
peredonov
and
varvara
decided
not
to
let
peredonov
meet
the
princess
i
no
one
to
depend
upon
but
you
said
varvara
help
me
darling
marya
ossipovna
how
can
i
help
my
dearest
varvara
dmitrievna
asked
grushina
of
course
you
know
i
ready
to
do
anything
i
can
for
you
shall
i
read
your
fortune
for
you
varvara
laughed
and
said
i
know
how
clever
you
are
but
you
must
help
me
another
way
how
asked
grushina
with
a
tremulous
expectant
pleasure
that
very
simple
replied
varvara
you
write
a
letter
in
the
princess
handwriting
and
i
show
it
to
ardalyon
borisitch
but
my
dear
how
can
i
do
it
said
grushina
pretending
to
be
alarmed
what
would
become
of
me
if
i
should
be
found
out
varvara
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
by
her
answer
but
pulled
a
crumpled
letter
out
of
her
pocket
saying
i
brought
one
of
the
princess
letters
for
you
to
copy
grushina
refused
for
a
long
time
varvara
saw
clearly
that
grushina
would
consent
but
that
she
was
bargaining
for
a
bigger
reward
while
varvara
wanted
to
give
less
she
gradually
increased
her
promises
of
various
small
gifts
among
them
an
old
silk
dress
until
grushina
saw
that
varvara
could
not
be
persuaded
to
give
any
more
a
stream
of
entreaties
poured
from
varvara
mouth
and
grushina
finally
took
the
letter
making
it
appear
from
the
expression
of
her
face
that
she
did
so
out
of
pity
a
musical
instrument
chapter
iv
the
was
full
of
peredonov
routilov
falastov
volodin
and
mourin
were
there
the
last
of
these
was
a
robust
landed
proprietor
of
stupid
appearance
he
was
the
owner
of
a
small
estate
and
a
good
business
man
the
five
of
them
having
finished
a
game
were
preparing
to
go
it
was
dusk
the
number
of
empty
beer
bottles
on
the
soiled
wooden
table
was
increasing
the
players
had
drunk
a
good
deal
during
the
game
their
faces
were
flushed
and
they
were
getting
noisy
routilov
alone
kept
his
usual
consumptive
pallor
he
really
drank
less
than
the
others
and
his
pallor
was
only
increased
by
heavy
drinking
coarse
words
flew
about
the
room
but
no
one
was
offended
it
was
all
said
among
friends
peredonov
had
lost
as
nearly
always
happened
he
played
billiards
badly
but
his
face
kept
its
expression
of
unperturbed
moroseness
and
he
paid
his
due
grudgingly
mourin
shouted
out
bang
and
he
aimed
his
at
peredonov
peredonov
exclaimed
in
fright
and
collapsed
into
a
chair
the
stupid
idea
that
mourin
wanted
to
shoot
him
glimmered
in
his
dull
mind
everyone
laughed
peredonov
grumbled
in
irritation
i
ca
stand
jokes
like
that
mourin
was
already
regretting
that
he
had
frightened
peredonov
his
son
was
attending
the
and
he
considered
it
his
duty
to
be
affable
to
the
instructors
he
began
to
apologise
to
peredonov
and
treated
him
to
hock
and
seltzer
peredonov
said
morosely
my
nerves
are
rather
unstrung
i
having
trouble
with
the
the
future
inspector
has
lost
exclaimed
volodin
in
his
bleating
voice
he
sorry
for
his
money
unlucky
in
games
lucky
in
love
said
routilov
smiling
slightly
and
showing
his
decaying
teeth
this
was
the
last
straw
peredonov
had
already
lost
money
and
had
a
fright
and
now
they
were
taunting
him
about
varvara
he
exclaimed
i
get
married
and
then
varka
can
clear
out
his
friends
roared
with
laughter
and
continued
provoking
him
you
wo
dare
yes
i
will
dare
i
get
married
here
a
bet
said
falastov
i
bet
ten
roubles
he
does
do
it
but
peredonov
thought
of
the
money
if
he
lost
he
would
have
to
pay
he
turned
away
and
lapsed
into
gloomy
silence
at
the
garden
gates
they
parted
and
scattered
in
different
directions
peredonov
and
routilov
went
together
routilov
began
to
persuade
peredonov
to
marry
one
of
his
sisters
at
once
do
be
afraid
i
prepared
everything
he
assured
peredonov
but
the
banns
have
been
published
objected
peredonov
i
tell
you
i
prepared
everything
argued
routilov
i
found
the
right
priest
who
knows
that
you
not
related
to
us
there
are
no
said
peredonov
that
quite
true
but
i
can
get
them
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
send
for
them
and
they
come
to
the
church
immediately
or
i
go
after
them
myself
it
was
possible
earlier
your
cousin
might
have
found
out
and
hindered
us
peredonov
did
not
reply
he
looked
gloomily
about
him
where
behind
their
drowsy
little
gardens
and
wavering
hedges
loomed
the
dark
shapes
of
a
few
scattered
houses
you
just
wait
at
the
gate
said
routilov
persuasively
i
bring
out
the
loveliest
one
whichever
one
you
like
listen
i
prove
it
to
you
twice
two
is
four
is
it
yes
assented
peredonov
well
as
twice
two
is
four
so
it
your
duty
to
marry
one
of
my
sisters
peredonov
was
impressed
it
quite
true
he
thought
of
course
twice
two
is
four
and
he
looked
respectfully
at
the
shrewd
routilov
well
it
come
to
marrying
one
of
them
you
ca
argue
with
him
the
friends
at
that
moment
reached
the
routilovs
house
and
stopped
at
the
gate
well
you
ca
do
it
by
force
said
peredonov
angrily
you
a
queer
fellow
exclaimed
routilov
they
waited
until
they
tired
and
perhaps
i
do
want
to
said
peredonov
what
do
you
mean
by
that
you
are
a
queer
chap
are
you
going
to
be
a
shiftless
fellow
all
your
life
asked
routilov
or
are
you
getting
ready
to
enter
a
monastery
or
are
you
tired
of
varya
yet
think
what
a
face
she
make
when
you
bring
your
young
wife
home
peredonov
gave
a
cackle
but
immediately
frowned
and
said
and
perhaps
they
also
do
want
to
what
do
you
mean
they
do
want
to
you
are
an
odd
fellow
answered
routilov
i
give
you
my
word
they
be
too
proud
objected
peredonov
why
should
that
bother
you
it
all
the
better
they
gigglers
but
they
never
giggle
at
your
expense
said
routilov
comfortingly
how
do
i
know
you
better
believe
me
i
not
fooling
you
they
respect
you
after
all
you
not
a
kind
of
pavloushka
who
make
anybody
laugh
yes
if
i
take
your
word
for
it
said
peredonov
incredulously
but
no
i
want
to
be
convinced
myself
well
you
are
an
odd
fellow
said
routilov
in
astonishment
but
how
would
they
dare
laugh
at
you
still
is
there
any
way
i
can
prove
it
to
you
peredonov
reflected
and
said
let
them
come
into
the
street
at
once
very
well
that
possible
agreed
routilov
all
three
of
them
continued
peredonov
very
well
and
let
each
one
say
how
she
please
me
why
all
this
asked
routilov
in
astonishment
i
find
out
what
they
want
and
then
you
wo
lead
me
by
the
nose
no
one
going
to
lead
you
by
the
nose
perhaps
they
want
to
laugh
at
me
argued
peredonov
now
if
they
come
out
and
want
to
laugh
it
is
i
who
be
able
to
laugh
at
them
routilov
reflected
pushed
his
hat
on
to
the
back
of
his
head
and
then
forward
over
his
forehead
and
said
at
last
all
right
you
wait
here
and
i
go
in
and
tell
them
but
certainly
an
odd
fellow
you
better
come
into
the
front
garden
or
else
the
devil
bring
someone
along
the
street
and
you
be
seen
i
spit
on
them
said
peredonov
nevertheless
he
entered
the
gate
routilov
went
into
the
house
to
his
sisters
while
peredonov
waited
in
the
garden
all
the
four
sisters
were
sitting
in
the
which
was
situated
in
the
corner
of
the
house
that
could
be
seen
from
the
garden
they
all
had
the
same
features
and
they
all
resembled
their
brother
they
were
handsome
rosy
and
cheerful
they
were
larissa
a
tranquil
pleasant
plump
woman
who
was
married
the
quick
agile
darya
the
tallest
and
the
slenderest
of
the
sisters
the
mischievous
liudmilla
and
valeria
who
was
small
delicate
and
they
were
eating
nuts
and
raisins
they
were
obviously
waiting
for
something
and
were
therefore
rather
agitated
and
laughed
more
than
usual
as
they
recalled
the
latest
town
gossip
they
ridiculed
both
their
own
acquaintances
and
strangers
ever
since
the
early
morning
they
had
been
quite
prepared
to
be
married
it
was
only
necessary
for
one
of
them
to
put
on
a
suitable
dress
with
a
veil
and
flowers
varvara
was
not
mentioned
in
the
sisters
conversation
as
though
she
did
not
exist
but
it
was
sufficient
that
they
the
pitiless
gossips
who
pulled
everyone
to
pieces
should
refrain
from
mentioning
varvara
this
complete
silence
showed
that
the
idea
of
varvara
was
fixed
like
a
nail
in
the
mind
of
each
i
brought
him
announced
routilov
entering
the
at
the
gate
the
sisters
rose
in
an
agitated
way
and
all
began
to
talk
and
laugh
at
the
same
time
there
only
one
difficulty
said
routilov
laughingly
and
what
that
asked
darya
valeria
frowned
her
handsome
dark
eyebrows
in
a
vexed
way
i
do
know
whether
to
tell
you
or
not
hesitated
routilov
be
quick
about
it
urged
darya
routilov
in
some
confusion
told
them
what
peredonov
wanted
the
girls
raised
an
outcry
and
they
all
began
to
abuse
peredonov
but
little
by
little
their
indignation
gave
place
to
jokes
and
laughter
darya
made
a
face
of
grim
expectation
and
said
but
he
waiting
at
the
gate
it
was
becoming
an
amusing
adventure
the
girls
began
to
peep
out
the
window
towards
the
gate
darya
opened
the
window
and
cried
out
ardalyon
borisitch
can
we
say
it
out
of
the
window
the
morose
answer
came
back
no
darya
quickly
slammed
down
the
window
the
sisters
burst
into
gay
unrestrained
laughter
and
ran
from
the
into
the
so
that
peredonov
might
not
hear
them
the
members
of
this
family
were
so
constituted
that
they
could
easily
pass
from
a
state
of
the
most
intense
anger
into
a
state
of
merriment
and
it
was
the
cheerful
word
that
usually
decided
a
matter
peredonov
stood
and
waited
he
felt
depressed
and
afraid
he
thought
he
would
run
away
but
could
not
decide
somewhere
from
afar
the
sounds
of
music
reached
him
the
frail
tender
sounds
poured
themselves
out
in
the
quiet
dark
night
air
and
they
awoke
sadness
and
gave
birth
to
pleasant
reveries
at
the
beginning
peredonov
reveries
took
on
an
erotic
turn
he
imagined
the
routilov
girls
in
the
most
seductive
poses
but
the
longer
he
waited
the
more
irritated
he
became
at
being
forced
to
wait
and
the
music
which
had
barely
aroused
his
hopelessly
coarse
emotions
died
for
him
all
around
him
the
night
descended
quietly
and
rustled
with
its
hoverings
and
whisperings
and
it
seemed
even
darker
everywhere
because
peredonov
stood
in
an
open
space
lit
up
by
the
lamp
its
two
streaks
of
light
broadened
as
they
reached
the
neighbouring
fence
the
dark
planks
of
which
became
visible
the
trees
in
the
depth
of
the
garden
assumed
dark
suspicious
whispering
shapes
someone
slow
heavy
footsteps
sounded
on
the
street
pavement
peredonov
began
to
feel
apprehensive
that
while
waiting
here
he
might
be
attacked
and
robbed
even
murdered
he
pressed
against
the
very
wall
in
the
shadow
and
timidly
waited
but
suddenly
long
shadows
shot
out
across
the
streaks
of
light
in
the
garden
a
door
slammed
and
voices
were
heard
on
the
verandah
peredonov
grew
animated
they
are
coming
he
thought
joyously
and
agreeable
thoughts
about
the
three
beauties
stole
softly
once
more
into
his
mind
disgusting
children
of
his
dull
imagination
the
sisters
stood
in
the
passage
routilov
walked
to
the
gate
and
looked
to
see
if
anyone
was
in
the
street
no
one
was
to
be
seen
or
heard
there
no
one
about
he
whispered
loudly
to
his
sisters
using
his
hands
as
a
he
remained
in
the
street
to
keep
watch
peredonov
joined
him
they
coming
out
to
speak
to
you
said
routilov
peredonov
stood
at
the
gate
and
looked
through
the
chink
between
the
gate
and
the
his
face
was
morose
and
almost
frightened
and
all
sorts
of
fancies
and
thoughts
expired
in
his
mind
and
were
replaced
by
a
heavy
aimless
desire
darya
was
the
first
to
come
up
to
the
open
gate
what
can
i
do
to
please
you
she
asked
peredonov
was
morosely
silent
darya
said
i
will
make
you
the
crispest
pancakes
piping
hot
only
do
choke
over
them
liudmilla
cried
over
her
shoulder
i
go
down
every
morning
and
collect
all
the
gossip
to
tell
you
that
will
make
us
jolly
between
the
two
girls
cheerful
faces
showed
for
a
moment
slender
capricious
face
and
her
slight
frail
voice
was
heard
i
would
tell
you
for
anything
how
i
shall
please
you
you
better
guess
yourself
the
sisters
ran
away
laughing
their
voices
and
laughter
ceased
directly
they
were
in
the
house
peredonov
turned
away
from
the
gate
he
was
not
quite
satisfied
he
thought
they
babbled
something
and
then
ran
away
it
would
have
been
far
better
if
they
put
it
on
paper
but
he
had
already
stood
here
waiting
long
enough
well
are
you
satisfied
asked
routilov
which
one
do
you
like
best
peredonov
was
lost
in
thought
of
course
he
concluded
at
last
he
ought
to
take
the
youngest
a
young
woman
is
always
better
than
an
older
one
bring
valeria
here
he
said
decisively
routilov
went
into
the
house
and
peredonov
again
entered
the
garden
liudmilla
looked
stealthily
out
of
the
window
trying
to
make
out
what
they
were
saying
without
any
success
but
suddenly
there
were
sounds
of
someone
approaching
by
the
garden
path
the
sisters
kept
silent
and
sat
there
nervously
routilov
entered
and
announced
he
chosen
valeria
and
he
waiting
at
the
gate
the
sisters
grew
noisy
at
once
and
began
to
laugh
valeria
went
slightly
pale
well
well
she
said
ironically
i
needed
him
very
badly
her
hands
trembled
all
three
of
the
sisters
began
to
fuss
about
her
and
to
put
finery
on
her
she
always
spent
a
lot
of
time
over
her
toilette
the
other
sisters
hurried
her
routilov
kept
continually
babbling
with
pleasure
and
excitement
he
was
delighted
that
he
had
managed
the
matter
so
cleverly
did
you
get
the
cabbies
asked
darya
with
a
worried
air
routilov
answered
with
slight
annoyance
how
could
i
the
whole
town
would
have
heard
of
it
varvara
would
have
come
and
dragged
him
away
by
his
hair
well
what
shall
we
do
why
we
can
go
to
the
square
in
pairs
and
hire
them
there
quite
simple
you
and
the
bride
go
first
then
larissa
with
the
bridegroom
now
mind
you
not
all
together
or
we
shall
be
noticed
in
town
liudmilla
and
i
will
stop
at
falastov
the
two
of
them
will
go
together
and
i
will
get
volodin
once
alone
peredonov
became
immersed
in
pleasant
reveries
he
imagined
valeria
in
all
the
bewitchment
of
the
bridal
night
undressed
bashful
but
happy
all
slenderness
and
subtlety
he
dreamed
and
at
the
same
time
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
some
caramels
that
had
stuck
there
and
began
to
chew
them
then
he
remembered
that
valeria
was
a
coquette
now
she
want
expensive
dresses
he
thought
that
meant
that
he
would
not
only
be
unable
to
save
money
every
month
but
that
he
would
have
to
spend
what
he
had
saved
she
would
be
hard
to
please
she
would
never
even
enter
the
kitchen
besides
his
food
might
get
poisoned
varvara
from
spite
would
bribe
the
cook
and
on
the
whole
thought
peredonov
valeria
is
a
slender
doll
it
difficult
to
know
how
to
treat
a
girl
like
that
how
could
one
abuse
her
and
how
could
one
give
her
an
occasional
push
how
could
one
spit
on
her
it
would
end
in
tears
and
she
would
shame
him
before
the
whole
town
no
it
was
impossible
to
tie
oneself
to
her
now
liudmilla
was
simpler
would
it
be
better
to
take
her
peredonov
walked
up
to
the
window
and
knocked
with
his
stick
on
the
pane
after
a
few
moments
routilov
stuck
his
head
out
of
the
window
what
do
you
want
he
asked
anxiously
i
thought
it
over
growled
peredonov
well
exclaimed
routilov
in
apprehension
bring
liudmilla
here
said
peredonov
routilov
left
the
window
he
a
devil
in
spectacles
he
grumbled
to
himself
and
went
to
his
sisters
valeria
was
glad
it
your
happiness
liudmilla
she
said
cheerfully
liudmilla
began
to
laugh
she
threw
herself
back
in
a
chair
and
laughed
and
laughed
what
shall
i
tell
him
asked
routilov
are
you
willing
liudmilla
could
not
speak
for
laughing
and
only
waved
her
hands
of
course
she
willing
said
darya
for
her
you
better
tell
him
at
once
or
else
he
may
go
off
in
a
huff
routilov
entered
the
and
said
in
a
whisper
through
the
window
wait
she
be
ready
at
once
let
her
make
haste
said
peredonov
angrily
why
are
they
so
long
liudmilla
was
soon
dressed
she
was
entirely
ready
in
five
minutes
peredonov
began
to
think
about
her
she
was
cheerful
and
plump
but
she
was
a
giggler
she
would
always
be
laughing
at
him
that
was
terrible
darya
though
she
was
lively
was
more
sober
but
she
was
quite
handsome
he
had
better
take
her
he
knocked
once
more
on
the
window
there
he
knocking
again
said
larissa
i
wonder
if
he
wants
you
now
darya
the
devil
said
routilov
irritatedly
and
ran
to
the
window
what
now
he
asked
in
an
angry
whisper
have
you
thought
it
over
again
bring
darya
answered
peredonov
well
just
wait
whispered
routilov
in
a
rage
peredonov
stood
there
and
thought
of
darya
and
again
his
brief
seductive
vision
of
her
was
replaced
by
apprehension
she
was
too
quick
and
impertinent
she
would
make
life
intolerable
to
him
and
what
on
earth
the
good
of
standing
here
waiting
reflected
peredonov
i
might
get
a
cold
and
you
ca
tell
there
may
be
someone
hiding
in
the
ditch
or
behind
the
grass
who
suddenly
jump
out
and
murder
me
peredonov
grew
very
depressed
then
again
none
of
them
had
any
dowry
to
speak
of
that
could
command
no
patronage
in
the
department
of
education
varvara
would
complain
to
the
princess
as
it
was
the
was
sharpening
his
teeth
for
peredonov
peredonov
began
to
get
vexed
with
himself
why
was
he
here
entangling
himself
with
the
routilovs
it
must
be
that
routilov
had
bewitched
him
yes
he
must
really
have
bewitched
him
he
must
make
a
at
once
peredonov
twirled
round
on
his
heels
spat
on
each
side
of
him
and
mumbled
chure
menya
chure
menya
chure
chure
chure
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
stern
attention
as
if
at
the
carrying
out
of
a
dignified
ceremony
after
this
indispensable
action
he
felt
himself
out
of
danger
of
routilov
spells
he
struck
the
window
decisively
with
his
stick
and
muttered
angrily
i
had
enough
of
this
i
wo
be
enticed
any
further
no
i
want
to
get
married
he
announced
to
routilov
whose
head
was
thrust
out
of
the
window
what
on
earth
the
matter
with
you
ardalyon
borisitch
why
everything
ready
said
routilov
persuasively
i
do
want
to
repeated
peredonov
with
decision
you
better
come
along
with
me
and
have
a
game
of
cards
the
devil
take
you
exclaimed
routilov
he
does
want
to
get
married
he
funked
it
he
announced
to
his
sisters
but
i
persuade
the
fool
yet
he
asked
me
to
play
cards
with
him
all
the
sisters
cried
out
at
once
abusing
peredonov
loudly
and
you
going
out
with
this
blackguard
asked
valeria
angrily
yes
and
i
get
even
with
him
he
has
not
escaped
us
yet
by
any
means
said
routilov
trying
to
keep
a
tone
of
assurance
but
feeling
very
awkward
the
girls
anger
with
peredonov
soon
gave
place
to
laughter
routilov
left
the
girls
ran
to
the
windows
ardalyon
borisitch
exclaimed
darya
why
ca
you
make
up
your
mind
you
should
do
things
like
this
kislyai
kislyaevitch
sour
sourson
exclaimed
liudmilla
laughingly
peredonov
was
angry
in
his
opinion
the
sisters
ought
to
have
wept
with
disappointment
that
he
had
rejected
them
they
pretending
he
thought
as
he
left
the
garden
silently
the
girls
ran
to
the
windows
facing
the
street
and
shouted
gibes
after
him
until
he
was
lost
in
the
darkness
this
is
an
exaggeration
of
a
russian
charm
used
against
witchcraft
the
word
chure
implies
hence
away
and
is
addressed
to
the
evil
spirits
the
whole
charm
is
a
jargon
practically
untranslatable
chapter
v
peredonov
felt
depressed
he
had
no
more
caramels
in
his
pocket
and
this
added
to
his
depression
and
distress
routilov
was
the
only
one
to
speak
almost
the
whole
way
he
continued
to
laud
his
sisters
only
once
did
peredonov
break
into
speech
when
he
asked
angrily
has
a
bull
horns
well
yes
but
what
of
it
asked
the
astonished
routilov
well
i
do
want
to
be
a
bull
explained
peredonov
ardalyon
borisitch
said
routilov
in
tones
of
annoyance
you
will
never
be
a
bull
for
you
are
a
real
swine
liar
said
peredonov
morosely
i
not
a
liar
i
can
prove
i
not
said
routilov
spitefully
go
ahead
and
prove
it
just
wait
i
prove
it
said
routilov
they
walked
on
silently
peredonov
waited
apprehensively
and
his
anger
with
routilov
tormented
him
suddenly
routilov
asked
ardalyon
borisitch
have
you
got
a
i
have
but
i
wo
give
it
to
you
answered
peredonov
routilov
burst
out
laughing
if
you
have
a
then
you
are
a
swine
he
exclaimed
peredonov
in
his
apprehension
grabbed
his
nose
and
exclaimed
you
lying
i
have
a
i
got
a
man
face
he
growled
routilov
was
still
laughing
peredonov
angry
and
rather
frightened
looked
cautiously
at
routilov
and
said
you
led
me
purposely
by
the
and
me
so
as
to
lure
me
for
one
of
your
sisters
as
if
one
witch
was
enough
for
me
you
tried
to
make
me
marry
three
at
once
you
are
a
queer
fellow
and
why
did
i
get
asked
routilov
you
got
some
way
or
other
said
peredonov
perhaps
you
breathed
through
your
mouth
instead
of
your
nose
or
you
may
have
recited
a
charm
for
my
part
i
do
know
at
all
how
to
act
against
witchcraft
i
do
know
much
about
black
magic
until
i
recited
the
i
was
quite
routilov
laughed
well
and
how
did
you
make
the
exorcism
he
asked
but
peredonov
did
not
reply
why
do
you
tie
yourself
up
with
varvara
asked
routilov
do
you
think
that
you
be
happier
if
she
gets
the
inspectorship
for
you
she
rule
the
roost
then
this
was
incomprehensible
to
peredonov
after
all
he
thought
she
was
really
acting
in
her
own
interests
she
herself
would
have
an
easier
time
if
he
became
an
important
official
and
she
would
have
more
money
that
meant
that
she
would
be
grateful
to
him
and
not
he
to
her
and
in
any
case
she
was
more
congenial
to
him
than
anyone
else
peredonov
was
accustomed
to
varvara
something
drew
him
to
her
perhaps
it
was
his
habit
which
was
very
pleasant
to
him
of
bullying
her
he
would
not
find
another
like
her
however
much
he
sought
it
was
already
late
the
lamps
were
lit
at
peredonov
house
the
lighted
windows
were
conspicuous
in
the
dark
street
the
was
surrounded
with
visitors
grushina
who
now
visited
varvara
every
day
volodin
prepolovenskaya
and
her
husband
konstantin
petrovitch
a
tall
man
under
forty
with
a
dull
pale
face
and
black
hair
a
person
of
an
amazing
taciturnity
varvara
was
in
a
white
party
dress
they
were
drinking
tea
and
talking
varvara
as
usual
was
distressed
because
peredonov
had
not
yet
returned
home
volodin
with
his
cheerful
bleat
was
telling
her
that
peredonov
had
gone
off
somewhere
with
routilov
this
only
increased
her
distress
at
last
peredonov
appeared
with
routilov
they
were
met
with
outcries
laughter
stupid
coarse
jokes
varvara
where
the
vodka
exclaimed
peredonov
gruffly
varvara
quickly
left
the
table
smiling
guiltily
and
brought
the
vodka
in
a
decanter
of
rudely
cut
glass
let
have
a
drink
was
peredonov
surly
invitation
just
wait
said
varvara
klavdiushka
will
bring
the
you
great
lump
she
shouted
into
the
kitchen
hurry
up
but
peredonov
was
already
pouring
the
liquor
into
the
vodka
glasses
he
growled
why
should
we
wait
time
does
wait
they
drank
their
vodka
and
helped
it
down
with
tarts
filled
with
black
currant
jam
peredonov
had
always
two
stock
entertainments
for
visitors
cards
and
vodka
but
as
they
could
not
sit
down
to
cards
before
the
tea
was
served
only
vodka
remained
in
the
meantime
the
also
were
brought
in
so
that
they
could
drink
some
more
vodka
klavdia
did
not
shut
the
door
when
she
went
out
which
put
peredonov
into
a
bad
humour
that
door
is
never
shut
he
growled
he
was
afraid
of
the
draught
he
might
catch
cold
this
was
why
his
house
was
always
stuffy
and
malodorous
prepolovenskaya
picked
up
an
egg
fine
eggs
she
said
where
do
you
get
them
peredonov
replied
they
not
bad
but
on
my
father
estate
there
was
a
hen
that
laid
two
large
eggs
every
day
all
the
year
round
that
nothing
to
boast
of
said
prepolovenskaya
now
in
our
village
there
was
a
hen
that
laid
two
eggs
every
day
and
a
spoonful
of
butter
yes
yes
we
had
one
like
that
too
said
peredonov
not
noticing
that
he
was
being
made
fun
of
if
others
could
do
it
ours
did
it
too
we
had
an
exceptional
hen
varvara
laughed
they
having
a
little
joke
she
said
such
nonsense
makes
one
ears
wither
said
grushina
peredonov
looked
at
her
savagely
and
replied
if
your
ears
wither
they
have
to
be
pulled
off
grushina
was
disconcerted
well
ardalyon
borisitch
you
always
saying
something
nasty
she
complained
the
others
laughed
appreciatively
volodin
opened
his
eyes
wide
twitched
his
forehead
and
explained
when
your
ears
start
withering
it
best
to
pull
them
off
because
if
you
do
they
dangle
and
swing
to
and
fro
volodin
made
a
gesture
with
his
fingers
to
indicate
how
the
withered
ears
would
dangle
grushina
snapped
at
him
that
the
sort
you
are
you
ca
make
a
joke
yourself
you
have
to
use
other
people
volodin
was
offended
and
said
with
dignity
i
can
make
a
joke
myself
maria
ossipovna
but
when
we
having
a
pleasant
time
in
company
why
should
i
keep
up
someone
else
joke
and
if
you
do
like
it
you
can
do
what
you
please
give
and
take
that
reasonable
pavel
vassilyevitch
said
routilov
encouragingly
pavel
vassilyevitch
can
stand
up
for
himself
said
prepolovenskaya
with
a
sly
smile
varvara
had
just
cut
off
a
piece
of
bread
and
absorbed
by
volodin
ingenious
remarks
held
the
knife
in
the
air
the
edge
glittered
peredonov
felt
a
sudden
fear
she
might
suddenly
take
it
into
her
head
to
slash
him
varvara
he
exclaimed
put
that
knife
down
varvara
shivered
why
do
you
shout
so
you
frightened
me
she
said
and
put
the
knife
down
he
has
his
whims
you
know
she
went
on
speaking
to
the
silent
prepolovensky
who
was
stroking
his
beard
and
apparently
about
to
speak
that
sometimes
happens
said
prepolovensky
i
had
an
acquaintance
who
was
afraid
of
needles
he
was
always
imagining
that
someone
was
going
to
stick
a
needle
into
him
and
that
the
needle
would
enter
his
inside
just
imagine
how
frightened
he
would
get
when
he
saw
a
needle
and
once
he
had
begun
to
speak
he
was
quite
unable
to
stop
and
went
on
telling
the
same
story
with
different
variations
until
someone
interrupted
him
and
changed
the
subject
then
he
lapsed
again
into
silence
grushina
changed
the
conversation
to
erotic
themes
she
began
to
relate
how
her
deceased
husband
was
jealous
of
her
and
how
she
deceived
him
afterwards
she
told
a
story
she
had
heard
from
an
acquaintance
in
the
capital
about
the
mistress
of
a
certain
eminent
personage
who
met
her
patron
while
driving
in
the
street
and
she
cries
to
him
zhanchick
grushina
related
mind
you
in
the
street
i
have
a
good
mind
to
report
you
said
peredonov
angrily
is
it
actually
permitted
for
such
nonsense
to
be
talked
about
important
people
grushina
gabbled
rapidly
to
try
and
appease
him
it
not
my
fault
that
how
i
heard
the
story
what
i
bought
i
sell
peredonov
maintained
an
angry
silence
and
drank
tea
from
a
saucer
with
his
elbows
resting
on
the
table
he
reflected
that
in
the
house
of
the
future
inspector
it
was
unbecoming
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
the
higher
powers
he
felt
annoyed
with
grushina
this
feeling
was
intensified
by
his
suspicion
of
volodin
who
too
frequently
referred
to
him
as
the
future
inspector
once
he
even
said
to
volodin
well
my
friend
i
see
that
you
are
jealous
but
the
fact
is
i
going
to
be
an
inspector
and
you
are
volodin
with
an
insinuating
look
on
his
face
had
replied
each
to
his
own
you
a
specialist
in
your
business
and
i
in
mine
our
natashka
said
varvara
went
straight
from
us
and
got
a
place
with
the
officer
of
the
gendarmes
peredonov
trembled
and
his
face
had
an
expression
of
fear
are
you
telling
a
lie
he
demanded
why
should
i
want
to
tell
you
a
lie
about
that
answered
varvara
you
can
go
and
ask
him
yourself
if
you
like
this
unpleasant
news
was
confirmed
by
grushina
peredonov
was
stupefied
with
astonishment
it
was
impossible
to
know
what
she
might
say
and
then
the
gendarmes
would
take
up
the
matter
and
report
it
to
the
authorities
it
was
a
bad
at
the
same
second
peredonov
eyes
rested
on
the
shelf
under
the
sideboard
there
stood
several
bound
volumes
the
thin
ones
were
the
works
of
pisarev
and
the
larger
ones
were
the
annals
of
the
fatherland
peredonov
went
pale
and
said
i
must
hide
those
books
or
i
shall
be
reported
earlier
peredonov
had
displayed
these
books
ostentatiously
to
show
that
he
was
a
man
of
emancipated
ideas
though
actually
he
had
no
ideas
at
all
and
no
inclination
towards
reflection
and
he
only
kept
these
books
for
show
not
to
read
it
was
now
a
long
time
since
he
had
read
a
book
he
used
to
say
he
had
no
time
he
did
not
subscribe
to
a
newspaper
he
got
his
news
from
other
people
in
fact
there
was
nothing
he
wanted
to
know
there
was
nothing
in
the
outside
world
he
was
interested
in
he
used
even
to
deride
subscribers
to
newspapers
as
people
who
wasted
both
time
and
money
one
might
have
thought
that
his
time
was
very
valuable
he
went
up
to
the
shelf
grumbling
that
what
happens
in
this
town
you
may
get
reported
any
minute
lend
a
hand
here
pavel
vassilyevitch
he
said
to
volodin
volodin
walked
towards
him
with
a
grave
and
comprehending
countenance
and
carefully
took
the
books
that
peredonov
handed
to
him
peredonov
carrying
a
heap
of
books
went
into
the
parlour
followed
by
volodin
who
carried
a
large
pile
where
do
you
mean
to
hide
them
ardalyon
borisitch
he
asked
wait
and
you
see
replied
peredonov
with
his
usual
gruffness
what
are
you
taking
away
there
ardalyon
borisitch
asked
prepolovensky
most
strictly
forbidden
books
answered
peredonov
from
the
door
i
should
be
reported
if
they
were
found
here
peredonov
sat
on
his
heels
before
the
brick
stove
in
the
parlour
he
threw
down
the
books
on
the
iron
hearth
and
volodin
did
the
same
peredonov
began
with
difficulty
to
force
book
after
book
into
the
small
opening
volodin
sat
on
his
heels
just
behind
peredonov
and
handed
him
the
books
preserving
at
the
same
time
an
air
of
profound
comprehension
on
his
sheepish
face
his
protruded
lips
and
heavy
forehead
expressing
his
sense
of
importance
varvara
looked
at
them
through
the
door
she
said
laughing
they
got
a
new
joke
but
grushina
interrupted
her
no
dearest
varvara
dmitrievna
you
should
say
that
things
might
be
very
unpleasant
if
they
found
out
especially
if
it
happens
to
be
an
instructor
the
authorities
are
dreadfully
afraid
that
the
instructors
will
teach
the
boys
to
rebel
after
tea
they
sat
down
to
play
stoukolka
card
all
seven
of
them
around
the
in
the
parlour
peredonov
played
irritatedly
and
badly
after
every
twenty
points
he
had
to
pay
out
to
the
other
players
especially
to
prepolovensky
who
received
for
himself
and
his
wife
the
prepolovenskys
won
more
frequently
than
anyone
they
had
certain
signs
like
knocks
and
coughs
by
which
they
told
each
other
what
cards
they
held
that
night
peredonov
had
no
luck
he
made
haste
to
win
back
his
money
but
volodin
was
slow
in
dealing
and
spent
too
much
time
in
shuffling
pavloushka
hurry
up
and
deal
shouted
peredonov
impatiently
volodin
feeling
himself
the
equal
of
anybody
in
the
game
looked
important
and
asked
what
do
you
mean
by
is
it
in
friendship
or
how
of
course
in
friendship
replied
peredonov
carelessly
only
deal
quicker
well
if
you
say
it
in
friendship
then
i
glad
very
glad
said
volodin
laughing
happily
and
stupidly
as
he
dealt
the
cards
you
a
good
fellow
ardasha
and
i
very
fond
of
you
but
if
it
were
in
friendship
it
would
be
another
matter
but
as
it
is
in
friendship
glad
i
given
you
an
ace
for
it
said
volodin
and
turned
up
trumps
peredonov
actually
had
an
ace
but
it
was
the
ace
of
trumps
and
he
had
to
sacrifice
it
routilov
babbled
on
incessantly
told
all
sorts
of
tales
and
anecdotes
some
of
an
exceedingly
indelicate
character
in
order
to
annoy
peredonov
routilov
began
to
tell
him
that
his
older
pupils
were
behaving
very
badly
especially
those
who
lived
in
apartments
they
smoked
drank
vodka
and
ran
after
girls
peredonov
believed
him
and
grushina
confirmed
what
routilov
said
these
stories
gave
her
especial
pleasure
she
herself
after
her
husband
death
had
wanted
to
board
three
or
four
of
the
students
at
her
house
but
the
would
not
give
her
the
requisite
permission
in
spite
of
recommendations
grushina
reputation
in
the
town
was
not
very
good
she
now
began
to
abuse
the
landladies
of
the
houses
where
the
students
had
apartments
they
bribing
the
she
declared
all
the
landladies
are
carrion
said
volodin
with
conviction
take
mine
for
instance
when
i
took
my
room
mine
agreed
to
give
me
three
glasses
of
milk
every
evening
for
the
first
two
months
i
got
it
and
you
did
get
drunk
asked
routilov
why
should
i
get
drunk
said
volodin
in
offended
tones
a
useful
product
it
my
habit
to
drink
three
glasses
of
milk
every
night
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
see
that
they
bring
me
only
two
glasses
the
meaning
of
this
i
ask
the
servant
says
mikhailovna
says
she
begs
your
pardon
because
the
cow
she
says
does
give
much
milk
now
what
that
to
do
with
me
an
agreement
is
more
sacred
than
money
suppose
their
cow
gave
no
milk
at
all
does
that
mean
i
not
to
have
any
milk
i
say
there
is
no
milk
then
tell
anna
mikhailovna
to
give
me
a
glass
of
water
i
used
to
three
glasses
and
i
must
have
them
our
pavloushka
a
hero
said
peredonov
tell
them
how
you
argued
with
the
general
old
chap
volodin
eagerly
repeated
his
story
but
this
time
they
laughed
at
his
expense
he
stuck
out
an
offended
underlip
after
supper
they
all
got
drunk
even
the
women
volodin
proposed
that
they
should
dirty
the
walls
some
more
they
were
delighted
almost
before
they
had
finished
supper
they
acted
on
this
suggestion
and
amused
themselves
prodigiously
they
spat
on
the
poured
beer
on
it
and
they
threw
at
the
walls
and
ceiling
paper
arrows
whose
ends
were
smeared
with
butter
and
they
flipped
pieces
of
moist
bread
at
the
ceiling
afterwards
they
invented
a
new
game
which
they
played
for
money
they
tore
off
strips
of
the
to
see
who
could
get
the
largest
but
at
this
game
the
prepolovenskys
won
another
rouble
and
a
half
volodin
lost
because
of
his
loss
and
his
intoxication
he
became
depressed
and
began
to
complain
about
his
mother
he
made
a
dolorous
face
and
gesticulating
ridiculously
with
his
hand
said
why
did
she
bear
me
and
what
did
she
think
at
the
time
what
my
life
now
she
not
been
a
mother
to
me
she
only
bore
me
because
whereas
a
real
mother
worries
about
her
child
mine
only
bore
me
and
sent
me
to
a
charitable
home
when
i
was
a
mere
baby
well
you
learnt
something
by
it
it
made
a
man
of
you
said
prepolovenskaya
volodin
bent
his
head
wagged
it
to
and
fro
and
said
no
what
my
life
a
dog
life
why
did
she
bear
me
what
did
she
think
then
peredonov
suddenly
remembered
yesterday
there
he
thought
he
complains
about
his
mother
because
she
bore
him
he
does
want
to
be
pavloushka
it
certain
that
he
envies
me
it
may
be
that
thinking
of
marrying
varvara
and
of
getting
into
my
skin
and
he
looked
anxiously
at
volodin
he
must
try
to
marry
him
to
someone
at
night
in
the
bedroom
varvara
said
to
peredonov
you
think
that
all
these
girls
who
are
running
after
you
are
really
they
all
trash
and
i
prettier
than
any
of
them
she
quickly
undressed
herself
and
smiling
insolently
showed
peredonov
her
rosy
graceful
flexible
and
beautiful
body
though
varvara
staggered
from
drunkenness
and
her
face
would
have
repelled
any
decent
man
with
its
expression
she
really
had
the
beautiful
body
of
a
nymph
with
the
head
of
a
faded
prostitute
attached
to
it
as
if
by
some
horrible
black
magic
and
this
superb
body
was
for
these
two
drunken
and
people
merely
the
source
of
the
vilest
libidinousness
and
so
it
often
happens
in
our
age
that
beauty
is
debased
and
abused
peredonov
laughed
gruffly
but
boisterously
as
he
looked
at
his
naked
companion
the
entire
night
he
dreamed
of
women
of
all
colours
naked
and
hideous
varvara
believed
that
the
friction
with
nettles
which
she
applied
at
prepolovenskaya
advice
helped
her
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
got
plumper
almost
at
once
she
asked
all
her
acquaintances
it
true
is
it
that
i
a
little
fuller
and
she
thought
that
now
peredonov
would
surely
marry
her
seeing
that
she
was
plumper
and
that
he
would
receive
the
forged
letter
peredonov
expectations
were
far
from
being
so
agreeable
as
hers
he
had
become
convinced
some
time
before
that
the
was
hostile
to
him
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
considered
peredonov
a
lazy
incapable
instructor
peredonov
imagined
that
the
told
the
boys
not
to
respect
him
which
it
is
obvious
was
an
absurd
invention
of
his
own
but
it
inspired
peredonov
with
the
idea
that
he
must
be
on
his
guard
against
the
from
spite
against
the
he
spoke
slightingly
of
him
more
than
once
in
the
classes
of
the
older
students
this
pleased
many
of
the
students
now
that
peredonov
was
hoping
to
become
an
inspector
the
attitude
towards
him
seemed
particularly
unpleasant
let
it
be
admitted
that
if
the
princess
should
so
desire
her
protection
would
override
the
unfriendliness
still
it
was
not
without
its
dangers
and
there
were
other
people
in
the
town
as
peredonov
had
lately
noticed
who
were
hostile
to
him
and
wanted
to
hinder
his
appointment
to
the
inspectorship
there
was
volodin
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
continually
repeated
the
words
the
future
inspector
there
have
been
occasions
when
people
have
assumed
another
man
name
with
great
profit
to
themselves
of
course
volodin
would
find
it
difficult
to
impersonate
peredonov
but
after
all
even
such
a
fool
as
volodin
might
have
the
idea
that
he
could
it
is
certain
that
we
ought
to
fear
every
evil
man
and
there
were
still
the
routilovs
vershina
with
her
marta
and
his
envious
colleagues
all
equally
ready
to
do
him
harm
and
how
could
they
harm
him
it
was
perfectly
clear
they
could
vilify
him
to
the
authorities
and
make
him
out
to
be
an
unreliable
man
so
that
peredonov
had
two
anxieties
one
to
prove
his
reliableness
and
the
other
to
secure
himself
from
volodin
by
marrying
him
to
a
rich
girl
peredonov
once
asked
volodin
if
you
like
i
get
you
engaged
to
the
adamenko
girl
or
are
you
still
pining
for
marta
is
a
month
long
enough
for
you
to
get
consoled
why
should
i
pine
for
marta
replied
volodin
i
done
her
a
great
honour
by
proposing
to
her
and
if
she
does
want
me
what
that
to
me
i
easily
find
someone
else
there
are
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
as
ever
came
out
of
it
well
but
marta
pulled
your
nose
for
you
nicely
said
peredonov
tauntingly
i
no
notion
what
sort
of
a
husband
they
looking
for
said
volodin
with
an
offended
air
they
have
even
any
dowry
to
speak
of
she
after
you
ardalyon
borisitch
peredonov
advised
him
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
should
smear
her
gates
with
tar
volodin
grinned
and
calmed
down
at
once
he
said
but
if
they
catch
me
it
might
be
unpleasant
hire
somebody
why
should
you
do
it
yourself
said
peredonov
and
she
deserves
it
honest
to
god
said
volodin
animatedly
a
girl
who
wo
get
married
and
yet
lets
young
fellows
in
through
the
window
that
means
that
human
beings
have
no
shame
or
conscience
piatachek
means
a
five
kopek
piece
and
also
a
pig
snout
routilov
puns
on
the
word
the
thorn
apple
or
datura
a
very
poisonous
plant
the
russians
have
a
verb
durmanised
meaning
bewitched
or
stupefied
by
the
durman
zakouska
savoury
salt
eatables
rather
like
eaten
with
vodka
a
journal
of
revolutionary
tendencies
suppressed
in
chapter
vi
the
next
day
peredonov
and
volodin
went
to
see
the
adamenko
girl
volodin
was
in
his
best
clothes
he
put
on
his
new
a
shirt
and
a
cravat
he
smeared
his
hair
with
pomade
and
scented
himself
he
was
in
fine
spirits
nadezhda
vassilyevna
adamenko
lived
with
her
brother
in
town
in
her
own
house
she
had
an
estate
not
far
from
town
which
she
let
on
lease
two
years
before
she
had
completed
a
course
in
the
local
college
and
now
she
occupied
herself
in
lying
on
a
couch
to
read
books
of
every
description
and
in
coaching
her
brother
an
schoolboy
who
always
protected
himself
against
his
sister
severities
by
saying
it
was
much
better
in
mamma
time
she
used
to
put
an
umbrella
in
the
corner
instead
of
me
nadezhda
vassilyevna
aunt
lived
with
her
she
was
a
characterless
decrepit
woman
with
no
voice
in
the
household
affairs
nadezhda
vassilyevna
chose
her
acquaintances
with
great
care
peredonov
was
very
seldom
in
her
house
and
only
his
lack
of
real
acquaintance
with
her
could
have
given
birth
to
his
idea
of
getting
her
to
marry
volodin
she
was
therefore
extremely
astonished
at
their
unexpected
visit
but
she
received
the
uninvited
guests
quite
graciously
she
had
to
amuse
them
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
most
likely
and
pleasant
method
of
entertaining
an
instructor
of
the
russian
language
would
be
to
talk
of
educational
conditions
school
reform
the
training
of
children
literature
symbolism
and
the
russian
literary
periodicals
she
touched
upon
all
these
themes
but
received
no
response
beyond
enigmatic
remarks
which
showed
that
these
questions
had
no
interest
for
her
guests
she
soon
saw
that
only
one
subject
was
possible
town
gossip
but
nadezhda
vassilyevna
nevertheless
made
one
more
attempt
have
you
read
the
in
the
case
by
chekhov
she
asked
it
a
clever
piece
of
work
is
it
as
she
turned
with
this
question
to
volodin
he
smiled
pleasantly
and
asked
is
that
an
essay
or
a
novel
it
a
short
story
exclaimed
nadezhda
did
you
say
it
was
by
mister
chekhov
inquired
volodin
yes
chekhov
said
nadezhda
and
smiled
where
was
it
published
asked
volodin
curiously
in
the
misl
the
young
woman
explained
graciously
in
what
number
continued
volodin
i
ca
quite
remember
i
think
it
was
in
one
of
the
summer
numbers
replied
nadezhda
still
graciously
but
with
some
astonishment
a
schoolboy
suddenly
appeared
from
behind
the
door
it
was
published
in
the
may
number
he
said
with
his
hand
on
the
glancing
at
his
sister
and
her
guests
with
cheerful
blue
eyes
you
too
young
to
read
novels
growled
peredonov
angrily
you
ought
to
work
instead
of
reading
indecent
stories
nadezhda
vassilyevna
looked
sternly
at
her
brother
it
is
a
nice
thing
to
stand
behind
doors
and
listen
she
remarked
and
lifting
her
hands
crossed
her
little
fingers
at
a
right
angle
the
boy
made
a
wry
face
and
disappeared
he
went
into
his
own
room
stood
in
the
corner
and
gazed
at
the
clock
two
little
fingers
crossed
was
a
sign
that
he
should
stand
in
the
corner
for
ten
minutes
no
he
thought
sadly
it
was
much
better
when
mamma
was
alive
she
only
put
an
umbrella
in
the
corner
meanwhile
in
the
volodin
was
promising
his
hostess
that
he
would
certainly
get
the
may
number
of
the
russkaya
misl
in
order
to
read
mister
chekhov
story
peredonov
listened
with
an
expression
of
unconcealed
boredom
on
his
face
at
last
he
said
i
have
read
it
either
i
do
read
such
nonsense
there
nothing
but
stupidities
in
stories
and
novels
nadezhda
vassilyevna
smiled
amiably
and
said
you
very
severe
towards
contemporary
literature
but
good
books
are
written
even
nowadays
i
read
all
the
good
books
long
ago
announced
peredonov
i
intend
to
begin
to
read
what
being
written
now
volodin
looked
at
peredonov
with
respect
nadezhda
vassilyevna
sighed
lightly
and
as
there
was
nothing
else
for
her
to
do
she
began
a
string
of
and
gossip
to
the
best
of
her
ability
although
she
disliked
such
conversation
she
managed
to
keep
it
up
with
the
ease
and
buoyancy
of
a
lively
girl
the
guests
became
animated
she
was
intolerably
bored
but
they
thought
that
she
was
particularly
gracious
and
they
put
it
down
to
the
charm
of
personality
once
in
the
street
peredonov
congratulated
volodin
upon
his
success
volodin
laughed
gleefully
and
skipped
about
he
had
already
forgotten
all
the
other
girls
who
had
rejected
him
do
kick
up
your
heels
like
that
said
peredonov
you
hopping
about
like
a
young
sheep
you
better
wait
you
may
have
your
nose
pulled
again
but
he
said
this
only
in
jest
and
he
fully
believed
in
the
success
of
the
match
he
had
devised
grushina
came
to
see
varvara
almost
every
day
varvara
was
at
grushina
even
oftener
so
that
they
were
scarcely
ever
parted
from
each
other
varvara
was
agitated
because
grushina
delayed
she
assured
varvara
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
copy
the
handwriting
so
that
the
resemblance
would
be
complete
peredonov
still
refrained
from
fixing
a
date
for
the
wedding
again
he
demanded
his
inspector
post
first
recollecting
how
many
girls
were
ready
to
marry
him
he
more
than
once
as
in
the
past
winter
said
to
varvara
threateningly
i
going
out
to
get
married
i
shall
be
back
in
the
morning
with
a
wife
and
then
out
you
go
this
is
your
last
night
here
and
having
said
this
he
would
go
to
play
billiards
from
there
he
would
sometimes
return
home
but
more
often
he
would
go
carousing
in
some
dirty
hole
with
routilov
and
volodin
on
such
nights
varvara
could
not
sleep
that
is
why
she
suffered
from
headaches
it
was
not
so
bad
if
he
returned
at
one
or
two
then
she
could
breathe
freely
but
if
he
did
not
turn
up
till
the
morning
then
the
day
found
varvara
quite
at
last
grushina
had
finished
the
letter
and
showed
it
to
varvara
they
examined
it
for
a
long
time
and
compared
it
with
the
letter
of
last
year
grushina
assured
her
that
the
letter
was
so
like
the
other
that
the
princess
herself
would
not
recognise
the
forgery
although
there
was
actually
little
resemblance
varvara
believed
her
she
also
realised
that
peredonov
would
not
remember
the
unfamiliar
handwriting
so
minutely
that
he
would
see
it
was
a
forgery
at
last
she
said
joyously
i
have
waited
and
waited
and
i
almost
lost
patience
but
what
shall
i
tell
him
about
the
envelope
if
he
asks
you
ca
very
well
forge
an
envelope
there
the
said
grushina
laughing
as
she
looked
at
varvara
with
her
cunning
unequal
eyes
one
of
them
wider
open
than
the
other
what
shall
we
do
varvara
dmitrievna
darling
just
tell
him
that
you
threw
the
envelope
into
the
fire
what
the
good
of
an
envelope
varvara
hopes
revived
she
said
once
we
married
he
wo
keep
me
any
longer
on
the
run
i
do
the
sitting
and
he
can
do
the
running
for
me
on
saturday
after
dinner
peredonov
went
to
play
billiards
his
thoughts
were
heavy
and
melancholy
he
thought
it
awful
to
live
among
hostile
and
envious
people
but
what
can
one
do
they
ca
all
be
inspectors
that
the
struggle
for
existence
at
the
corner
of
two
streets
he
met
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
an
unpleasant
meeting
nikolai
vadimovitch
roubovsky
a
stout
man
with
heavy
eyebrows
cheerful
grey
eyes
and
a
limping
gait
which
made
his
spurs
jingle
unevenly
and
loudly
was
a
very
amiable
person
and
was
therefore
popular
in
society
he
knew
all
the
people
in
town
all
their
affairs
and
relations
and
loved
to
hear
gossip
but
was
himself
as
discreet
and
silent
as
the
grave
and
caused
no
one
any
unnecessary
unpleasantness
they
stopped
greeted
each
other
and
entered
into
conversation
peredonov
looked
frowningly
on
each
side
and
said
cautiously
i
hear
that
our
natasha
is
with
you
now
you
must
believe
anything
she
tells
you
about
me
because
she
lying
i
do
listen
to
servants
gossip
said
roubovsky
with
dignity
she
really
a
bad
one
said
peredonov
paying
no
attention
to
roubovsky
remark
her
young
man
is
a
pole
very
likely
she
came
to
you
on
purpose
to
get
hold
of
some
official
secret
please
do
worry
about
that
said
the
dryly
i
have
any
plans
of
fortresses
in
my
possession
this
introduction
of
fortresses
perplexed
peredonov
it
seemed
to
him
that
roubovsky
was
hinting
at
something
that
he
thought
of
imprisoning
peredonov
in
a
fortress
it
nothing
to
do
with
fortresses
it
a
very
different
matter
he
muttered
but
all
sorts
of
stupid
things
are
being
said
about
me
for
the
most
part
from
envy
do
believe
any
of
them
they
informing
against
me
in
order
to
get
suspicion
away
from
themselves
but
i
can
do
some
informing
myself
roubovsky
was
mystified
i
assure
you
he
said
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
jingling
his
spurs
that
no
one
has
informed
against
you
it
is
obvious
that
someone
has
been
pulling
your
leg
people
of
course
will
talk
nonsense
sometimes
peredonov
was
mistrustful
he
thought
that
the
was
concealing
something
and
he
suddenly
felt
a
terrible
apprehension
every
time
that
peredonov
walked
past
vershina
garden
vershina
would
stop
him
and
with
her
bewitching
gestures
and
words
would
lure
him
into
the
garden
and
he
would
enter
unwillingly
yielding
to
her
quiet
witchery
perhaps
she
had
a
better
chance
of
succeeding
in
her
purpose
than
the
routilovs
for
was
not
peredonov
equally
unrelated
to
them
all
and
therefore
why
should
he
not
marry
marta
but
it
was
evident
that
the
morass
into
which
peredonov
was
sinking
was
so
tenacious
that
no
magic
could
ever
have
got
him
out
of
it
into
another
and
now
after
this
meeting
with
roubovsky
as
peredonov
was
walking
past
vershina
she
dressed
in
black
as
usual
enticed
him
in
marta
and
vladya
are
going
home
for
the
day
she
said
looking
tenderly
at
peredonov
with
her
eyes
through
the
smoke
of
her
cigarette
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
for
you
to
spend
the
day
with
them
in
the
village
a
workman
had
just
come
in
a
cart
for
them
there
is
enough
room
said
peredonov
morosely
i
think
you
could
manage
it
said
vershina
and
even
if
you
have
to
squeeze
in
a
little
it
wo
be
a
great
hardship
you
only
got
six
versts
to
go
meanwhile
marta
ran
out
of
the
house
to
ask
vershina
something
the
excitement
of
getting
off
dissipated
her
usual
languor
and
her
face
was
livelier
and
more
cheerful
they
both
tried
to
persuade
peredonov
to
go
you
manage
quite
comfortably
vershina
assured
him
you
and
marta
can
sit
at
the
back
and
vladya
and
ignaty
in
front
look
there
the
cart
in
the
yard
now
peredonov
followed
them
into
the
yard
where
the
cart
was
standing
vladya
was
fussing
about
putting
various
things
in
it
the
cart
was
quite
a
large
one
but
peredonov
morosely
surveyed
it
and
announced
i
not
going
there
is
enough
room
there
are
four
of
us
and
those
things
besides
well
if
you
think
it
going
to
be
a
tight
squeeze
said
varshina
vladya
can
go
on
foot
of
course
said
vladya
with
a
suppressed
grin
i
start
at
once
and
i
get
there
before
you
then
peredonov
declared
that
the
cart
would
jolt
and
that
he
did
not
like
jolts
they
returned
to
the
everything
was
ready
but
ignaty
was
still
in
the
kitchen
eating
slowly
and
solidly
how
does
vladya
get
on
with
his
lessons
asked
marta
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
talk
about
with
peredonov
and
vershina
had
more
than
once
reproached
her
for
not
knowing
how
to
entertain
him
badly
said
peredonov
he
lazy
and
does
pay
attention
vershina
loved
to
grumble
she
began
to
scold
vladya
the
boy
flushed
and
smiled
and
shrivelled
into
his
clothes
as
if
he
were
cold
lifting
one
shoulder
higher
than
the
other
as
his
habit
was
the
year
has
only
just
begun
he
said
i
got
plenty
of
time
to
catch
up
you
ought
to
start
from
the
very
beginning
said
marta
in
a
very
way
which
slightly
embarrassed
her
yes
he
always
in
mischief
said
peredonov
only
yesterday
he
was
running
about
with
some
of
the
others
as
if
they
were
street
boys
impertinent
too
last
thursday
he
was
quite
cheeky
to
me
vladya
suddenly
flushed
up
with
indignation
yet
still
smiled
and
said
i
was
impertinent
i
only
told
the
truth
the
other
had
five
mistakes
not
marked
and
all
mine
were
marked
and
i
only
got
two
though
mine
was
better
than
the
boys
who
got
three
and
that
was
the
only
time
you
were
impertinent
persisted
peredonov
i
was
impertinent
i
only
said
that
i
would
tell
the
inspector
said
vladya
heatedly
vladya
you
forget
yourself
said
vershina
angrily
instead
of
apologising
you
only
repeating
what
you
said
vladya
suddenly
remembered
that
he
ought
not
to
provoke
peredonov
as
he
might
marry
marta
he
grew
even
redder
and
in
his
confusion
shifted
his
belt
and
said
timidly
i
sorry
i
only
meant
to
ask
you
to
make
the
correction
be
quiet
please
interrupted
vershina
i
ca
stand
such
wrangling
i
really
ca
she
repeated
and
her
thin
body
trembled
almost
imperceptibly
you
being
spoken
to
so
be
silent
and
vershina
poured
out
on
vladya
many
reproachful
words
puffing
at
her
cigarette
and
smiling
her
wry
smile
as
she
usually
did
when
she
was
talking
no
matter
what
the
subject
was
we
shall
have
to
tell
your
father
so
that
he
can
punish
you
she
concluded
he
needs
birching
suggested
peredonov
and
looked
angrily
at
the
offending
vladya
certainly
agreed
vershina
he
needs
birching
he
needs
birching
repeated
marta
and
blushed
i
going
with
you
to
your
father
said
peredonov
and
see
that
he
gives
you
a
good
birching
vladya
looked
silently
at
his
tormentors
shrank
within
himself
and
smiled
through
his
tears
his
father
was
a
harsh
man
vladya
tried
to
console
himself
with
the
thought
that
these
were
only
threats
surely
he
thought
they
would
not
really
spoil
his
holiday
for
a
holiday
was
a
specially
happy
occasion
and
not
a
schoolday
affair
but
peredonov
was
always
pleased
when
he
saw
boys
cry
especially
when
he
so
arranged
it
that
they
cried
and
apologised
at
the
same
time
vladya
confusion
the
suppressed
tears
in
his
eyes
and
his
timid
guilty
smile
all
these
gave
peredonov
joy
he
decided
to
accompany
marta
and
vladya
very
well
i
come
with
you
he
said
to
marta
marta
was
glad
but
a
little
frightened
of
course
she
wanted
peredonov
to
go
with
them
or
it
would
perhaps
be
more
truthful
to
say
that
vershina
wanted
it
for
her
and
had
instilled
the
desire
into
her
by
suggestion
but
now
that
peredonov
said
that
he
would
come
marta
somehow
felt
uneasy
on
vladya
account
she
felt
sorry
for
him
vladya
also
became
sad
surely
peredonov
was
not
going
on
his
account
in
the
hope
of
appeasing
peredonov
he
said
if
you
think
ardalyon
borisitch
that
it
will
be
a
tight
squeeze
then
i
will
go
on
foot
peredonov
looked
at
him
suspiciously
and
said
that
all
very
well
but
if
i
let
you
go
alone
you
run
away
somewhere
no
i
think
we
had
better
take
you
to
your
father
and
give
you
what
you
deserve
vladya
flushed
once
more
and
sighed
he
began
to
feel
uneasy
and
depressed
and
indignant
at
this
cruel
morose
man
to
soften
peredonov
heart
he
decided
to
make
his
seat
more
comfortable
i
make
it
so
that
you
wo
feel
the
jolts
he
said
and
he
scurried
hastily
towards
the
cart
vershina
looked
after
him
still
smoking
with
her
wry
smile
and
said
quietly
to
peredonov
they
all
afraid
of
their
father
he
very
stern
with
them
marta
flushed
vladya
wanted
to
take
with
him
to
the
village
his
new
english
bought
with
his
money
and
he
wanted
to
take
something
else
but
this
would
have
occupied
room
in
the
cart
and
so
vladya
carried
all
his
goods
back
into
the
house
the
weather
was
moderate
the
sun
was
beginning
to
decline
the
road
wet
with
the
morning
rain
was
free
of
dust
the
cart
rolled
evenly
over
the
fine
stones
carrying
its
four
passengers
from
the
town
the
grey
cob
trotted
along
as
if
their
weight
were
nothing
and
the
lazy
taciturn
driver
ignaty
drove
the
cob
on
a
light
rein
peredonov
was
seated
beside
marta
they
had
made
him
a
wide
seat
so
that
marta
was
very
uncomfortable
but
he
did
not
notice
this
and
even
if
he
had
noticed
it
he
would
have
thought
it
quite
proper
since
he
was
the
guest
peredonov
felt
on
very
good
terms
with
himself
he
decided
to
talk
very
amiably
to
marta
to
joke
with
her
and
to
entertain
her
this
is
how
he
began
well
are
you
going
to
rebel
soon
why
rebel
asked
marta
you
poles
are
always
getting
ready
to
rebel
but
it
useless
i
not
thinking
about
it
at
all
said
marta
and
there
no
one
among
us
who
wants
to
rebel
oh
you
only
say
that
you
really
hate
the
russians
we
have
any
such
idea
said
vladya
turning
to
peredonov
from
the
front
seat
yes
we
know
what
sort
of
an
idea
you
have
about
it
answered
peredonov
but
we
not
going
to
give
poland
back
to
you
we
have
conquered
you
we
have
conferred
many
benefits
on
you
and
yet
it
true
that
however
well
you
feed
a
wolf
he
always
looks
towards
the
wood
marta
said
nothing
after
a
short
silence
peredonov
said
abruptly
the
poles
have
no
brains
marta
flushed
there
are
all
kinds
of
people
among
both
russians
and
poles
she
said
no
what
i
say
is
true
persisted
peredonov
the
poles
are
stupid
they
only
submit
to
force
take
the
jews
they
clever
the
jews
are
cheats
they
not
clever
at
all
said
vladya
no
the
jews
are
a
very
clever
people
the
jew
always
gets
the
best
of
a
russian
but
a
russian
never
gets
the
best
of
a
jew
it
is
a
great
thing
to
get
the
best
of
other
people
said
vladya
is
mind
only
to
be
used
for
cheating
peredonov
looked
angrily
at
vladya
the
mind
is
for
learning
and
you
do
learn
he
said
vladya
sighed
and
turned
away
and
began
to
watch
the
cob
even
trotting
but
peredonov
continued
the
jews
are
clever
in
everything
clever
in
learning
and
in
everything
if
the
jews
were
allowed
to
become
professors
all
professors
would
be
jews
but
the
polish
women
are
all
sluts
he
looked
at
marta
and
noted
with
satisfaction
that
she
blushed
violently
he
became
amiable
now
do
think
that
i
talking
about
you
i
know
that
you
would
be
a
good
housekeeper
all
polish
women
are
good
housekeepers
replied
marta
well
yes
said
peredonov
they
good
housekeepers
they
clean
on
top
but
their
petticoats
are
dirty
but
then
you
had
mickiewicz
he
better
than
our
pushkin
he
hangs
on
my
wall
pushkin
used
to
hang
there
but
i
took
him
down
and
hung
him
in
the
privy
he
was
a
lackey
but
you
a
russian
said
vladya
what
our
mickiewicz
to
you
pushkin
a
good
poet
and
mickiewicz
a
good
poet
mickiewicz
is
better
asseverated
peredonov
the
russians
are
fools
they
invented
only
the
samovar
nothing
else
peredonov
looked
at
marta
screwed
up
one
eye
and
said
you
got
a
lot
of
freckles
that
not
pretty
what
can
one
do
asked
marta
smiling
i
got
freckles
too
said
vladya
turning
round
on
his
narrow
seat
and
brushing
against
the
silent
ignaty
you
a
boy
said
peredonov
and
so
it
does
matter
a
man
need
be
handsome
but
it
does
become
a
girl
he
went
on
turning
to
marta
no
one
will
want
to
marry
you
you
ought
to
bathe
your
face
in
marta
thanked
him
for
his
advice
vladya
looked
smilingly
at
peredonov
what
are
you
grinning
at
said
peredonov
just
wait
till
there
then
you
get
what
waiting
for
you
vladya
shifting
in
his
seat
looked
attentively
at
peredonov
and
tried
to
find
out
if
he
were
joking
or
speaking
seriously
but
peredonov
could
not
bear
to
have
anyone
stare
at
him
what
are
you
eyeing
me
for
he
asked
harshly
there
are
no
patterns
on
me
are
you
trying
to
cast
a
spell
on
me
vladya
was
frightened
and
turned
away
his
eyes
i
sorry
he
added
timidly
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
and
do
you
believe
in
the
evil
eye
asked
marta
of
course
the
evil
eye
is
a
superstition
said
peredonov
angrily
but
it
so
awfully
rude
to
stare
at
people
there
was
an
awkward
silence
for
the
next
few
minutes
you
very
poor
are
you
said
peredonov
suddenly
well
we
not
rich
said
marta
but
still
we
not
so
poor
each
one
of
us
has
a
little
something
put
aside
peredonov
looked
at
her
incredulously
and
said
i
sure
you
poor
you
go
barefoot
at
home
every
day
we
do
do
it
from
poverty
exclaimed
vladya
what
then
from
wealth
asked
peredonov
and
burst
into
a
laugh
not
at
all
from
poverty
said
vladya
flushing
it
very
good
for
the
health
it
hardens
one
and
it
very
pleasant
in
summer
you
lying
said
peredonov
coarsely
rich
people
do
go
barefoot
your
father
has
a
lot
of
children
and
has
got
tuppence
to
keep
them
on
you
ca
afford
to
buy
so
many
boots
great
polish
poet
who
is
held
to
have
been
the
greatest
slavonic
poet
with
the
exception
of
pushkin
chapter
vii
varvara
had
no
knowledge
of
peredonov
trip
she
passed
an
extremely
distressing
night
when
peredonov
returned
to
town
in
the
morning
he
did
not
go
home
but
asked
to
be
driven
to
church
it
was
time
for
mass
it
seemed
dangerous
to
him
now
not
to
go
to
church
often
they
might
inform
against
him
if
he
did
not
at
the
church
gate
he
met
a
schoolboy
with
a
rosy
ingenuous
face
and
innocent
blue
eyes
peredonov
said
to
him
hullo
there
mashenka
hullo
girlie
misha
koudryavtsev
flushed
painfully
peredonov
often
teased
him
by
calling
him
mashenka
misha
did
not
understand
why
and
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
complain
a
number
of
his
companions
stupid
youngsters
elbowing
each
other
laughed
at
peredonov
words
they
too
liked
to
tease
misha
the
church
dedicated
to
the
prophet
elias
an
old
structure
built
in
the
days
of
tsar
mikhail
stood
in
the
square
facing
the
school
for
this
reason
on
church
holidays
at
mass
and
for
vespers
the
schoolboys
had
to
gather
here
and
to
stand
in
rows
on
the
left
by
the
chapel
of
catherine
the
martyr
while
behind
them
stood
one
of
the
assistant
masters
in
order
to
keep
discipline
here
also
in
a
row
nearer
the
centre
of
the
church
stood
the
form
masters
as
well
as
the
inspector
and
the
with
their
families
it
was
usual
for
nearly
all
the
orthodox
schoolboys
to
gather
here
except
the
few
who
were
permitted
to
attend
their
parish
churches
with
their
parents
the
choir
of
schoolboys
sang
well
and
for
this
reason
the
church
was
attended
by
merchants
of
the
first
guild
officials
and
the
families
of
landed
gentry
there
were
only
a
few
of
the
common
folk
especially
since
in
conformity
with
the
wish
mass
was
celebrated
there
later
than
in
other
churches
peredonov
stood
in
his
usual
place
from
which
he
could
see
all
the
members
of
the
choir
screwing
up
his
eyes
he
looked
at
them
and
thought
that
they
were
standing
out
of
their
places
if
he
had
been
inspector
he
would
have
pulled
them
up
there
was
for
example
a
boy
named
kramarenko
a
small
thin
fidgety
youngster
who
was
constantly
turning
this
way
and
that
way
whispering
smiling
and
there
was
no
one
to
keep
him
in
order
it
seemed
to
be
no
one
affair
what
confusion
thought
peredonov
these
are
all
that
dark
youngster
there
has
a
fine
clear
soprano
so
he
thinks
he
can
whisper
and
grin
in
church
and
peredonov
frowned
at
his
side
stood
a
the
inspector
of
the
national
schools
sergey
potapovitch
bogdanov
an
oldish
man
with
a
brown
stupid
face
who
always
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
explain
to
somebody
something
which
he
could
never
make
head
or
tail
of
himself
no
one
was
easier
to
frighten
or
to
astonish
than
bogdanov
no
sooner
did
he
hear
anything
new
or
disquieting
than
his
forehead
would
become
wrinkled
from
his
inward
painful
efforts
and
from
his
mouth
would
issue
a
string
of
incoherent
and
perplexed
exclamations
peredonov
bent
towards
him
and
said
in
a
whisper
one
of
your
schoolmistresses
walks
about
in
a
red
shirt
bogdanov
was
alarmed
his
white
adam
apple
twitched
with
fear
under
his
chin
what
do
you
say
he
whispered
hoarsely
who
is
she
the
fat
one
i
do
know
what
her
name
is
whispered
peredonov
the
one
the
one
repeated
bogdanov
in
a
confused
way
that
must
be
skobotchkina
yes
yes
that
must
be
the
one
declared
peredonov
well
good
heavens
who
have
thought
that
exclaimed
bogdanov
skobotchkina
in
a
red
shirt
well
did
you
see
it
with
your
own
eyes
yes
i
saw
her
and
they
tell
me
she
goes
into
school
like
that
and
sometimes
even
worse
she
puts
on
a
sarafan
and
walks
about
like
a
common
girl
you
do
say
so
i
must
look
into
it
we
ca
have
that
we
have
that
she
have
to
be
dismissed
dismissed
i
say
babbled
on
bogdanov
she
was
always
like
that
mass
was
over
as
they
were
leaving
the
church
peredonov
said
to
kramarenko
here
you
why
were
you
grinning
in
church
just
wait
i
shall
tell
your
father
kramarenko
looked
at
peredonov
in
astonishment
and
ran
past
him
without
speaking
he
belonged
to
that
number
of
pupils
who
thought
peredonov
coarse
stupid
and
unjust
and
who
therefore
disliked
and
despised
him
the
majority
of
the
pupils
thought
similarly
peredonov
imagined
that
these
were
the
boys
who
had
been
prejudiced
against
him
by
the
if
not
personally
at
least
through
his
sons
peredonov
was
approached
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
by
volodin
he
was
chuckling
happily
and
his
face
was
as
cheerful
as
if
it
were
his
birthday
he
wore
a
bowler
hat
and
carried
his
cane
in
the
fashionable
way
i
something
to
tell
you
ardalyon
borisitch
he
said
gleefully
i
managed
to
persuade
cherepnin
and
very
soon
he
going
to
smear
marta
gate
with
tar
peredonov
said
nothing
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
considering
something
and
then
suddenly
burst
into
his
usual
morose
laughter
volodin
at
once
ceased
grinning
assumed
a
sober
look
straightened
his
bowler
hat
looked
at
the
sky
swung
his
stick
and
said
it
a
fine
day
but
it
looks
as
if
it
will
rain
this
evening
well
let
it
rain
i
shall
spend
the
evening
at
the
future
inspector
house
i
ca
waste
any
time
at
home
now
said
peredonov
i
got
more
important
affairs
to
attend
to
in
town
volodin
looked
as
if
he
comprehended
though
he
really
had
no
idea
what
business
peredonov
had
to
attend
to
peredonov
determined
that
he
must
without
fail
make
several
visits
yesterday
chance
meeting
with
the
had
suggested
to
him
an
idea
which
now
seemed
to
him
very
important
to
make
the
rounds
of
all
important
personages
of
the
town
to
assure
them
of
his
loyalty
if
he
should
succeed
then
in
an
emergency
peredonov
would
find
defenders
in
the
town
who
would
testify
to
the
correctness
of
his
attitude
where
are
you
going
ardalyon
borisitch
asked
volodin
seeing
that
peredonov
was
turning
off
from
the
path
by
which
he
usually
went
back
from
church
are
you
going
home
yes
i
going
home
answered
peredonov
but
i
do
like
to
go
along
that
street
now
why
there
a
lot
of
growing
there
and
the
smell
very
strong
i
very
much
affected
by
it
it
stupefies
me
my
nerves
are
on
edge
just
now
i
seem
to
have
nothing
but
worries
volodin
face
once
more
assumed
a
comprehending
and
sympathetic
expression
on
the
way
peredonov
pulled
off
some
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
what
do
you
want
those
for
asked
volodin
with
a
grin
for
the
cat
answered
peredonov
gruffly
are
you
going
to
stick
them
in
its
fur
asked
volodin
yes
volodin
sniggered
do
begin
without
me
he
cried
peredonov
asked
him
to
come
in
at
once
but
volodin
declared
that
he
had
an
appointment
he
suddenly
felt
that
it
was
the
right
thing
not
to
have
appointments
peredonov
words
about
his
affairs
had
inspired
him
with
the
idea
that
it
would
be
well
for
him
to
visit
the
adamenko
girl
on
his
own
and
to
tell
her
that
he
had
some
new
splendid
drawings
which
needed
framing
perhaps
she
would
like
to
look
at
them
in
any
case
thought
volodin
nadezhda
vassilyevna
will
ask
me
to
have
a
cup
of
coffee
and
so
that
was
what
volodin
did
he
suddenly
invented
another
scheme
he
proposed
to
nadezhda
vassilyevna
that
her
brother
should
take
up
carpentry
nadezhda
vassilyevna
imagined
that
volodin
was
in
need
of
money
and
she
immediately
consented
they
agreed
to
work
for
two
hours
three
times
a
week
for
which
volodin
was
to
get
thirty
roubles
a
month
volodin
was
in
raptures
here
was
some
cash
and
the
possibility
of
frequent
meetings
with
nadezhda
vassilyevna
peredonov
returned
home
gloomy
as
usual
varvara
pale
from
her
sleepless
night
grumbled
you
might
have
told
me
yesterday
that
you
were
coming
home
peredonov
provoked
her
by
saying
maliciously
that
he
had
been
on
a
trip
with
marta
varvara
was
silent
she
held
the
princess
letter
in
her
hand
it
was
a
forged
letter
but
still
she
said
to
him
at
luncheon
with
a
meaning
smile
while
you
were
gadding
about
with
marfushka
i
received
an
answer
from
the
princess
i
did
know
you
wrote
to
her
peredonov
face
lighted
up
with
a
gleam
of
dull
expectation
well
that
good
did
you
yourself
tell
me
to
write
well
what
did
she
say
asked
peredonov
with
some
agitation
here
the
letter
read
it
for
yourself
varvara
fumbled
for
a
long
time
in
her
pockets
and
finally
found
the
letter
and
gave
it
to
peredonov
he
stopped
eating
and
grabbed
the
letter
eagerly
he
read
it
and
was
overjoyed
here
at
last
was
a
clear
and
definite
promise
at
the
moment
no
doubts
entered
his
mind
he
quickly
finished
his
luncheon
and
went
out
to
show
the
letter
to
his
acquaintances
and
friends
with
a
grim
animation
he
entered
vershina
garden
vershina
as
nearly
always
was
standing
at
the
gate
smoking
she
was
very
pleased
formerly
she
had
to
lure
him
in
now
he
came
in
himself
vershina
thought
that
comes
of
his
going
on
a
trip
with
marta
he
spent
some
time
with
her
and
now
he
come
again
i
wonder
if
he
means
to
propose
to
her
peredonov
disillusioned
her
immediately
by
showing
her
the
letter
you
kept
disbelieving
it
he
said
and
here
the
princess
has
written
read
that
and
see
for
yourself
vershina
looked
incredulously
at
the
letter
quickly
blew
tobacco
smoke
on
it
several
times
running
made
a
wry
smile
and
asked
quietly
and
quickly
but
where
the
envelope
peredonov
suddenly
felt
alarmed
he
suspected
that
varvara
was
trying
to
deceive
him
and
had
written
the
letter
herself
he
must
get
the
envelope
from
her
at
once
i
do
know
he
said
i
must
ask
he
said
to
vershina
and
went
quickly
back
to
his
own
house
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
assure
himself
as
soon
as
possible
of
the
source
of
the
letter
the
sudden
doubt
tormented
him
vershina
standing
at
the
gate
looked
after
him
with
her
wry
smile
rapidly
puffing
out
cigarette
smoke
as
if
she
were
trying
to
finish
the
cigarette
like
a
tiresome
lesson
peredonov
came
running
home
with
a
frightened
and
tormented
face
and
while
yet
in
the
passage
he
shouted
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
agitation
varvara
where
the
envelope
what
envelope
asked
varvara
in
a
trembling
voice
she
looked
at
peredonov
insolently
and
would
have
flushed
had
she
not
been
already
rouged
the
envelope
from
the
princess
of
the
letter
you
gave
me
explained
peredonov
with
a
look
varvara
gave
a
forced
laugh
i
burnt
it
what
good
was
it
to
me
she
said
why
should
i
keep
it
i
not
making
a
collection
of
envelopes
you
ca
get
any
money
for
envelopes
you
can
only
get
money
for
empty
bottles
at
a
pub
peredonov
walked
gloomily
about
the
rooms
and
growled
there
are
all
sorts
of
princesses
we
know
that
perhaps
this
princess
lives
here
varvara
pretended
not
to
understand
his
suspicions
but
yet
trembled
violently
when
towards
evening
peredonov
strolled
past
vershina
cottage
she
stopped
him
have
you
found
the
envelope
she
asked
vara
tells
me
she
burnt
it
vershina
laughed
and
the
white
thin
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
wavered
before
her
in
the
quiet
cool
air
it
strange
she
said
that
your
cousin
is
so
careless
here
an
important
letter
and
no
envelope
you
might
have
been
able
to
tell
from
the
when
it
was
sent
and
where
from
peredonov
was
extremely
irritated
in
vain
vershina
invited
him
into
the
garden
in
vain
she
promised
to
look
in
the
cards
for
him
peredonov
left
nevertheless
he
showed
the
letter
to
his
friends
and
boasted
and
his
friends
believed
him
but
peredonov
did
not
know
whether
to
believe
or
not
at
all
events
he
decided
to
begin
on
tuesday
his
round
of
visits
to
important
personages
in
the
town
to
strengthen
his
position
he
decided
not
to
begin
on
monday
as
it
was
an
unlucky
day
sarafan

see
note
above
search

or

chapter
viii
as
soon
as
peredonov
left
to
play
billiards
varvara
went
off
to
see
grushina
they
argued
for
a
long
time
and
at
last
decided
to
mend
the
matter
with
another
letter
varvara
knew
that
grushina
had
friends
in
peterburg
with
their
assistance
it
would
be
easy
to
get
the
letter
posted
in
peterburg
just
as
on
the
first
occasion
grushina
for
a
long
time
pretended
to
have
scruples
oh
varvara
dmitrievna
darling
she
said
even
the
first
letter
makes
me
tremble
i
always
afraid
whenever
i
see
a
police
inspector
near
the
house
i
almost
faint
i
think
they
coming
for
me
to
take
me
to
jail
for
a
whole
hour
varvara
tried
to
persuade
her
she
promised
her
all
sorts
of
gifts
and
even
offered
a
little
money
in
advance
in
the
end
grushina
agreed
they
decided
to
act
in
this
way
first
varvara
would
say
that
she
had
replied
to
the
princess
letter
thanking
her
then
after
several
days
a
letter
would
arrive
ostensibly
from
the
princess
in
that
letter
it
would
be
even
more
definitely
stated
that
there
were
certain
positions
in
view
and
that
as
soon
as
they
were
married
it
would
be
possible
with
a
little
effort
to
procure
one
for
peredonov
this
letter
like
the
first
would
be
written
by
grushina
then
they
would
seal
it
up
put
a
seven
kopeck
stamp
on
it
grushina
would
enclose
it
in
a
letter
to
her
friend
in
peterburg
who
would
drop
it
into
a
presently
varvara
and
grushina
set
out
to
a
shop
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
town
and
there
bought
a
packet
of
narrow
envelopes
with
a
coloured
lining
and
some
coloured
paper
the
last
of
the
kind
in
the
shop
this
precaution
had
been
suggested
by
grushina
in
order
to
help
conceal
the
forgery
the
narrow
envelopes
were
chosen
so
that
the
forged
letter
could
easily
be
enclosed
in
another
envelope
when
they
got
back
to
grushina
house
they
composed
the
letter
when
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
days
the
letter
was
ready
they
scented
it
with
chypre
the
remaining
envelopes
and
paper
they
burnt
so
that
no
trace
should
be
left
grushina
wrote
to
her
friend
telling
her
the
precise
day
on
which
the
letter
was
to
be
posted
they
calculated
for
the
letter
to
arrive
on
sunday
when
peredonov
was
at
home
this
would
be
an
additional
proof
of
the
letter
genuineness
on
tuesday
peredonov
tried
to
get
home
earlier
from
school
circumstances
helped
him
his
last
lesson
was
in
a
whose
door
opened
into
the
corridor
where
the
clock
hung
and
where
the
school
porter
an
alert
rang
the
bell
at
stated
intervals
peredonov
sent
the
porter
into
the
office
to
get
the
and
himself
put
the
clock
a
quarter
of
an
hour
forward
no
one
noticed
him
at
home
peredonov
refused
his
luncheon
and
asked
for
dinner
to
be
prepared
later
he
had
certain
business
to
attend
to
they
tangle
and
tangle
and
i
must
untangle
said
he
angrily
thinking
of
the
snares
which
his
enemies
were
preparing
for
him
he
put
on
a
which
he
seldom
wore
and
in
which
he
felt
constrained
and
uneasy
his
body
had
grown
stouter
with
years
and
the
sat
badly
on
him
he
was
annoyed
because
he
had
no
orders
or
decorations
to
wear
other
people
had
them
even
falastov
of
the
town
school
had
and
he
peredonov
had
none
it
was
all
the
malice
not
once
had
he
been
nominated
he
was
sure
of
his
rank
this
the
could
not
take
away
but
what
was
the
use
of
that
if
there
were
no
visible
signs
of
it
however
his
new
uniform
would
show
his
rank
it
was
pleasant
to
think
that
the
epaulettes
of
this
uniform
would
be
according
to
the
rank
and
not
according
to
the
class
he
taught
this
would
look
important
the
epaulettes
like
a
general
and
one
large
star
everyone
in
the
street
could
see
at
once
that
a
state
councillor
was
walking
by
i
shall
have
to
order
my
new
uniform
soon
thought
peredonov
he
went
into
the
street
and
only
then
he
began
to
wonder
with
whom
he
should
begin
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
his
circumstances
the
most
important
people
were
the
commissioner
of
police
and
the
district
attorney
it
was
obvious
that
he
ought
to
begin
with
them
or
possibly
with
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
but
at
the
thought
of
starting
with
them
he
was
seized
with
apprehension
marshal
veriga
was
after
all
a
general
who
had
a
governorship
in
view
the
commissioner
of
police
and
the
district
attorney
were
the
terrible
representatives
of
the
police
and
the
law
at
the
beginning
thought
peredonov
i
ought
to
begin
with
the
lesser
officials
and
then
look
about
me
and
nose
around
then
it
will
be
clear
how
they
treat
me
and
what
they
say
about
me
this
is
why
peredonov
decided
that
it
would
be
wiser
to
begin
with
the
mayor
although
he
was
a
merchant
and
had
only
been
educated
in
the
district
school
still
he
went
about
everywhere
and
everyone
came
to
his
house
his
position
gave
him
the
respect
of
the
town
and
even
in
other
towns
and
in
the
capital
he
had
quite
important
acquaintances
and
peredonov
resolutely
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
mayor
house
the
weather
was
gloomy
the
leaves
fell
from
the
boughs
submissively
and
wearily
peredonov
felt
somewhat
apprehensive
in
the
house
a
smell
of
parquet
floors
mingled
with
a
barely
perceptible
and
yet
pleasant
odour
of
food
it
was
quiet
and
depressing
there
the
mayor
children
a
schoolboy
and
a
growing
girl
she
has
a
governess
to
look
after
her
her
father
used
to
say
were
decorously
in
their
rooms
there
it
was
cosy
restful
and
cheerful
the
windows
looked
out
on
the
garden
the
furniture
was
comfortable
there
were
all
sorts
of
games
in
the
rooms
and
in
the
garden
the
children
voices
sounded
cheerfully
in
the
rooms
facing
the
street
where
visitors
were
received
everything
was
affected
and
severe
the
red
wood
furniture
was
like
immensely
magnified
toy
models
it
was
quite
awkward
for
ordinary
people
to
sit
in
when
you
sat
down
you
felt
as
if
you
had
dropped
on
a
stone
but
the
heavy
host
seemed
to
sit
down
quite
comfortably
the
archimandrite
of
the
suburban
monastery
who
often
visited
the
mayor
called
these
chairs
to
which
the
mayor
would
answer
yes
i
do
like
those
womanish
luxuries
that
you
see
in
other
houses
you
sit
down
on
springs
and
you
shake
you
shake
yourself
and
the
furniture
shakes
what
the
use
of
that
and
in
any
case
the
doctors
also
do
approve
of
soft
furniture
the
mayor
yakov
anikyevitch
skouchayev
met
peredonov
on
the
threshold
of
his
he
was
a
tall
robust
man
with
closely
cropped
dark
hair
he
comported
himself
with
dignity
and
courtesy
though
not
altogether
free
from
contemptuousness
towards
people
of
small
means
peredonov
sat
down
heavily
in
a
broad
chair
and
said
in
answer
to
his
host
first
polite
questions
i
come
on
business
with
pleasure
what
can
i
do
for
you
said
the
mayor
politely
in
his
cunning
little
black
eyes
suddenly
glimmered
a
spark
of
contempt
he
thought
that
peredonov
had
come
to
borrow
money
and
decided
that
he
could
not
let
him
have
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
there
were
quite
a
number
of
officials
in
town
who
owed
skouchayev
more
or
less
significant
sums
skouchayev
never
referred
to
the
loan
but
he
never
extended
further
credit
to
the
delinquent
debtors
he
always
gave
willingly
the
first
time
according
to
the
standing
and
condition
of
the
borrower
you
as
mayor
yakov
anikyevitch
are
the
first
personage
in
the
town
said
peredonov
that
why
i
came
to
have
a
talk
with
you
skouchayev
assumed
an
important
air
and
inclined
his
head
slightly
as
he
sat
in
the
chair
all
sorts
of
scandal
are
being
spread
about
me
said
peredonov
morosely
they
invent
things
that
never
happened
you
ca
gag
other
people
mouths
said
the
mayor
and
in
any
case
in
our
little
palestines
it
well
known
that
gossips
have
nothing
to
do
except
to
wag
their
tongues
they
say
i
do
go
to
church
but
that
not
true
continued
peredonov
i
do
go
it
true
i
did
go
on
elias
day
but
that
was
because
i
had
a
stomach
ache
otherwise
i
always
go
that
quite
true
the
host
confirmed
i
happened
to
see
you
there
myself
though
i
do
often
go
to
your
church
i
usually
go
to
the
monastery
it
been
a
custom
of
our
family
for
a
long
time
all
sorts
of
scandal
are
being
spread
about
me
said
peredonov
they
say
that
i
tell
the
schoolboys
nasty
tales
but
that
nonsense
of
course
i
sometimes
tell
them
something
amusing
at
a
lesson
to
make
it
interesting
you
yourself
have
a
boy
at
school
now
he
has
told
you
anything
of
the
sort
about
me
has
he
that
quite
true
agreed
skouchayev
nothing
of
the
sort
has
happened
however
youngsters
are
usually
cunning
they
never
repeat
what
they
know
they
ought
to
repeat
of
course
my
boy
is
still
quite
small
he
young
enough
to
have
repeated
something
silly
but
i
assure
you
he
has
said
nothing
of
the
sort
and
in
the
elder
classes
they
know
everything
for
themselves
went
on
peredonov
but
of
course
i
never
say
anything
improper
there
naturally
replied
skouchayev
a
school
is
not
a
market
place
that
the
kind
of
people
they
are
here
complained
peredonov
they
invent
tales
of
things
that
never
happened
that
why
i
come
to
you
you
the
mayor
of
the
town
skouchayev
felt
very
flattered
that
peredonov
had
come
to
him
he
did
not
understand
what
it
was
all
about
but
he
was
shrewd
enough
not
to
show
his
lack
of
comprehension
and
there
are
other
things
being
said
about
me
continued
peredonov
for
one
thing
that
i
live
with
varvara
they
say
that
she
not
my
cousin
but
my
mistress
and
she
only
a
cousin
to
me
honest
to
god
she
a
very
distant
relative
only
a
third
cousin
there
nothing
against
marrying
her
indeed
i
going
to
marry
her
of
course
said
skouchayev
reflectively
besides
a
bride
wreath
ends
the
matter
it
was
impossible
earlier
said
peredonov
i
had
important
reasons
it
was
utterly
impossible
or
i
should
have
married
long
ago
believe
me
skouchayev
assumed
an
air
of
dignity
frowned
and
tapping
on
the
dark
tablecloth
with
his
plump
white
fingers
said
i
believe
you
if
that
is
so
it
alters
the
case
entirely
i
believe
you
now
i
must
confess
that
it
was
a
little
dubious
for
you
to
live
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
so
with
your
companion
without
marrying
her
it
was
very
dubious
perhaps
because
well
you
know
children
are
an
impressionable
race
they
apt
to
pick
things
up
it
hard
to
teach
them
what
good
but
the
bad
comes
easily
to
them
that
why
it
was
really
dubious
and
besides
whose
business
is
it
that
how
i
look
at
it
it
flatters
me
that
you
come
to
complain
to
me
because
although
i
only
one
of
the
common
folk
i
did
go
beyond
the
district
school
still
i
have
the
respect
and
confidence
of
society
this
is
my
third
year
as
mayor
so
that
my
word
counts
for
something
among
the
burgesses
skouchayev
talked
and
all
the
time
entangled
himself
in
his
own
thoughts
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
never
end
his
he
stopped
abruptly
and
thought
irritatedly
this
is
a
waste
of
time
that
the
trouble
with
these
learned
men
you
ca
understand
what
they
want
everything
clear
to
him
to
the
learned
man
in
his
books
but
as
soon
as
he
gets
his
nose
out
of
his
books
he
tangles
up
himself
and
tangles
up
other
people
he
fixed
his
eye
on
peredonov
with
a
look
of
perplexity
his
keen
eyes
grew
dull
his
stout
body
relapsed
into
the
chair
and
he
seemed
no
longer
the
brisk
man
of
action
but
simply
a
rather
foolish
old
man
peredonov
was
silent
for
a
while
as
if
he
were
bewitched
by
his
last
words
then
screwing
up
his
eyes
with
an
indefinable
clouded
expression
he
said
you
the
mayor
of
the
town
so
you
can
say
that
it
all
nonsense
that
is
in
what
respect
inquired
skouchayev
cautiously
well
explained
peredonov
if
they
should
inform
against
me
in
the
district
that
i
do
go
to
church
or
something
or
other
then
if
they
should
come
and
ask
you
might
put
in
a
word
for
me
this
we
can
do
said
the
mayor
in
any
case
you
can
rely
on
us
if
anything
should
happen
then
we
stand
up
for
you
why
should
we
put
in
a
word
for
a
good
man
we
might
even
send
in
a
testimonial
from
the
town
council
that
all
we
can
do
or
perhaps
if
you
like
we
can
give
you
a
personal
recommendation
from
some
prominent
citizen
why
not
we
can
do
it
if
it
comes
to
the
pinch
so
i
may
depend
on
you
said
peredonov
gravely
as
if
replying
to
something
not
altogether
pleasant
to
him
there
the
always
persecuting
me
you
do
say
so
exclaimed
skouchayev
shaking
his
head
sympathetically
i
ca
imagine
how
that
can
be
except
from
slanders
nikolai
vlasyevitch
it
seems
to
me
is
a
very
reliable
man
who
would
injure
anyone
for
nothing
i
can
judge
that
from
his
son
he
a
serious
rigid
man
who
allows
no
indulgences
and
makes
no
personal
distinctions
in
short
he
a
reliable
man
it
could
be
except
from
slanders
why
are
you
at
loggerheads
we
do
agree
in
our
views
explained
peredonov
and
there
are
people
in
the
school
who
are
jealous
of
me
they
all
want
to
be
inspectors
it
because
princess
volchanskaya
has
promised
to
get
me
an
inspector
job
and
so
they
mad
with
jealousy
said
skouchayev
cautiously
but
in
any
case
why
should
we
go
on
with
our
tongues
dry
let
have
a
snack
and
a
drink
skouchayev
pressed
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
near
the
hanging
lamp
that
a
handy
trick
said
he
to
peredonov
i
think
it
would
be
bad
for
you
to
get
into
another
official
position
now
dashenka
he
said
to
the
pleasant
looking
of
heavy
build
who
came
in
answer
to
the
bell
bring
in
some
and
some
coffee
piping
hot
kind
understand
yes
replied
dashenka
smiling
as
she
walked
out
with
a
remarkably
light
step
considering
her
heaviness
yes
in
another
department
skouchayev
turned
to
peredonov
again
say
in
the
ecclesiastical
if
you
take
holy
orders
you
would
make
quite
a
serious
reliable
priest
i
could
help
you
into
it
i
have
influential
friends
among
the
church
dignitaries
skouchayev
named
several
diocesan
and
suffragan
bishops
no
i
do
want
to
be
a
priest
answered
peredonov
i
afraid
of
the
incense
it
makes
me
feel
sick
and
giddy
well
if
that
the
case
why
do
you
join
the
police
advised
skouchayev
you
might
for
example
become
a
commissioner
of
police
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
your
rank
is
i
a
state
councillor
said
peredonov
importantly
well
well
exclaimed
skouchayev
in
surprise
you
certainly
get
high
rank
in
your
profession
and
all
that
because
you
teach
the
youngsters
that
shows
knowledge
is
something
though
nowadays
there
are
certain
gentlemen
who
attack
it
still
we
ca
do
without
it
though
i
only
went
to
a
district
school
i
am
sending
my
boy
to
a
university
when
you
send
him
to
a
you
have
to
force
him
to
go
sometimes
with
a
birch
but
he
go
to
a
university
of
his
own
free
will
let
me
say
that
i
never
birch
him
but
if
he
gets
lazy
or
does
something
naughty
i
simply
take
him
by
the
shoulders
to
the
window
there
are
birch
trees
in
the
garden
i
point
to
the
trees
you
see
that
i
say
to
him
see
papa
he
says
wo
do
it
again
and
true
enough
it
helps
the
youngster
mends
his
ways
as
if
he
actually
been
whipped
ah
those
children
those
children
concluded
skouchayev
with
a
sigh
peredonov
remained
two
hours
at
skouchayev
the
business
talk
was
followed
by
abundant
hospitality
skouchayev
regaled
him
as
he
did
everything
else
very
solidly
as
if
he
were
conducting
an
important
affair
at
the
same
time
he
tried
to
introduce
some
ingenious
tricks
into
his
hospitality
they
brought
punch
in
large
glasses
like
coffee
and
the
host
called
it
his
little
coffee
the
vodka
glasses
looked
as
if
the
foot
had
been
broken
off
and
the
stem
sharpened
so
that
they
would
not
stand
upright
on
the
table
now
i
call
these
in
and
pour
out
exclaimed
the
host
then
the
merchant
tishkov
arrived
a
small
brisk
and
cheerful
man
in
very
long
boots
he
drank
a
great
deal
of
vodka
and
said
all
sorts
of
absurdities
in
rhyme
briskly
and
gaily
and
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
very
satisfied
with
himself
peredonov
decided
at
last
that
it
was
time
to
go
home
and
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
said
the
host
stay
a
while
stay
a
while
and
help
us
smile
said
tishkov
no
it
time
to
leave
replied
peredonov
with
a
preoccupied
air
it
time
to
leave
or
his
cousin
grieve
said
tishkov
and
winked
at
skouchayev
just
now
i
a
busy
man
said
peredonov
he
who
a
busy
man
we
praise
him
all
we
can
answered
tishkov
promptly
skouchayev
escorted
peredonov
to
the
hall
they
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
at
parting
peredonov
was
pleased
with
his
visit
the
mayor
on
my
side
he
thought
confidently
when
he
returned
to
tishkov
skouchayev
said
they
gossip
about
that
youth
they
may
gossip
about
that
youth
but
they
do
know
the
truth
tishkov
caught
him
up
immediately
deftly
pouring
himself
a
glass
of
english
bitter
it
was
evident
that
he
was
not
paying
attention
to
what
was
said
to
him
but
that
he
only
caught
up
words
for
the
sake
of
rhyme
he
not
a
bad
fellow
said
skouchayev
he
a
hearty
chap
and
not
a
fool
at
drinking
continued
skouchayev
as
he
poured
himself
a
drink
paying
no
attention
to
tishkov
rhyming
if
he
not
a
fool
at
drinking
then
he
not
an
ass
at
thinking
shouted
tishkov
gaily
swallowing
his
drink
at
one
gulp
that
he
fussing
around
with
a
what
does
that
matter
said
skouchayev
well
he
got
a
but
she
may
be
a
damn
sell
replied
tishkov
he
who
has
not
sinned
against
god
is
not
responsible
to
the
tsar
against
god
we
all
sinned
by
love
we
all
pinned
but
he
wants
to
hide
his
sin
under
a
they
hide
sin
under
a
bridal
wreath
and
tear
each
other
with
furious
teeth
tishkov
always
talked
in
this
way
when
the
conversation
did
not
concern
his
own
affairs
he
might
have
bored
everybody
to
tears
but
they
had
all
got
used
to
him
and
did
not
notice
his
brisk
rhyming
but
occasionally
they
let
him
loose
on
a
but
it
was
all
the
same
to
tishkov
whether
they
listened
to
him
or
not
he
could
not
help
catching
up
other
people
words
to
make
rhymes
and
he
acted
with
the
infallibility
of
a
shrewdly
devised
if
you
looked
at
his
quick
precise
movements
you
might
conclude
that
he
was
not
a
living
person
that
he
was
already
dead
or
had
never
lived
and
that
he
saw
nothing
in
the
living
world
and
heard
nothing
but
words
this
rhyming
fellow
is
not
such
a
rare
specimen
as
may
seem
to
the
english
reader
the
tendency
to
speak
in
rhymes
is
rather
common
among
russian
peasants
the
is
an
interesting
native
institution
he
usually
improvises
rhymes
at
gatherings
and
entertainments
in
open
places
especially
at
carnivals
and
fairs
there
is
also
the
the
tent
grandfather
who
appears
in
a
tent
in
a
long
white
beard
of
flax
and
makes
jests
in
rhymes
it
is
an
institution
that
is
gradually
disappearing
chapter
ix
the
next
day
peredonov
went
to
see
the
district
attorney
avinovitsky
again
it
was
a
gloomy
day
the
wind
came
in
violent
blasts
and
whirled
clouds
of
dust
before
it
the
evening
was
coming
on
and
everything
was
permeated
with
the
dead
melancholy
light
of
bleak
skies
a
depressing
silence
filled
the
streets
and
it
seemed
as
if
all
these
pitiful
houses
had
sprung
up
to
no
purpose
as
if
these
hopelessly
decayed
structures
timidly
hinted
at
the
poor
tedious
life
that
lurked
within
their
walls
a
few
people
walked
in
the
streets
and
they
walked
slowly
as
if
they
barely
conquered
the
drowsiness
that
inclined
them
to
repose
only
children
eternal
unwearying
vessels
of
divine
joy
were
lively
and
ran
about
and
played
but
even
they
showed
signs
of
inertia
and
some
sort
of
ugly
hidden
monster
nestling
behind
their
shoulders
looked
out
now
and
then
with
eyes
full
of
menace
upon
their
suddenly
dulled
faces
in
the
midst
of
the
depression
of
these
streets
and
houses
under
estranged
skies
upon
the
unclean
and
impotent
earth
walked
peredonov
tormented
by
confused
fears
there
was
no
comfort
for
him
in
the
heights
and
no
consolation
upon
the
earth
because
now
as
before
he
looked
upon
the
world
with
dead
eyes
like
some
demon
who
in
his
dismal
loneliness
despaired
with
fear
and
with
yearning
his
feelings
were
dull
and
his
consciousness
was
a
corrupting
and
deadening
apparatus
all
that
reached
his
consciousness
became
transformed
into
abomination
and
filth
all
objects
revealed
their
imperfections
to
him
and
their
imperfections
gave
him
pleasure
when
he
walked
past
an
erect
and
clean
column
he
had
a
desire
to
make
it
crooked
and
to
bespatter
it
with
filth
he
laughed
with
joy
when
something
was
being
besmirched
in
his
presence
he
detested
very
clean
schoolboys
and
persecuted
them
he
called
them
the
skin
scrubbers
he
comprehended
the
slovenly
ones
more
easily
there
were
neither
beloved
objects
for
him
nor
beloved
people
and
this
made
it
possible
for
nature
to
act
upon
his
feelings
only
as
an
irritant
the
same
was
true
of
his
meetings
with
people
especially
with
strangers
and
new
acquaintances
to
whom
it
was
not
possible
to
be
impolite
happiness
for
him
was
to
do
nothing
and
shutting
himself
in
from
the
world
to
gratify
his
belly
and
now
i
must
go
against
my
will
he
thought
and
explain
matters
what
a
burden
what
a
bore
if
he
had
an
opportunity
at
least
of
besmirching
the
place
he
was
about
to
visit
but
even
this
consolation
was
denied
to
him
the
district
attorney
house
only
intensified
peredonov
feeling
of
grim
apprehension
and
really
this
house
had
an
angry
evil
look
the
high
roof
descended
gloomily
upon
the
windows
which
came
in
contact
with
the
ground
and
its
wooden
border
and
the
roof
itself
had
at
one
time
been
painted
gaily
and
brightly
but
time
and
the
rains
had
turned
the
colouring
gloomy
and
grey
the
huge
ponderous
gates
towering
above
the
house
and
fitted
as
it
were
to
repel
hostile
attacks
were
always
bolted
behind
them
rattled
a
chain
and
a
huge
dog
howled
in
a
hoarse
bass
at
every
all
around
were
uncultivated
spots
vegetable
gardens
and
hovels
which
stood
awry
in
front
of
the
district
attorney
house
was
a
long
hexagonal
space
the
middle
of
which
somewhat
deeper
than
the
rest
was
all
unpaved
and
overgrown
with
grass
at
the
house
itself
stood
a
the
only
one
to
be
seen
peredonov
slowly
and
unwillingly
ascended
the
four
high
steps
leading
to
the
porch
which
was
covered
with
a
roof
and
pulled
the
begrimed
handle
of
the
bell
the
bell
resounded
quite
close
to
him
with
a
sharp
and
continuous
tinkle
soon
stealthy
footsteps
were
heard
someone
seemed
to
approach
the
door
on
and
then
remained
standing
there
intensely
still
very
likely
someone
was
looking
at
him
through
some
invisible
crevice
then
there
was
the
creak
of
iron
hinges
and
the
door
opened
a
gloomy
freckled
girl
stood
on
the
threshold
and
looked
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
suspicious
scrutiny
whom
do
you
want
she
asked
peredonov
said
that
he
had
come
to
see
aleksandr
alekseyevitch
on
business
the
girl
let
him
in
no
sooner
had
he
crossed
the
threshold
than
he
made
haste
to
pronounce
a
charm
and
it
was
well
that
he
did
so
he
had
not
yet
had
time
to
take
off
his
coat
when
he
heard
avinovitsky
sharp
angry
voice
coming
from
the
there
was
always
something
terrifying
in
the
district
attorney
voice
he
could
not
speak
otherwise
so
even
now
he
was
already
shouting
in
the
in
his
angry
and
abusive
voice
a
greeting
of
welcome
and
joy
that
peredonov
had
at
last
thought
of
coming
to
him
aleksandr
alekseyevitch
avinovitsky
was
a
man
of
gloomy
appearance
and
seemed
by
nature
fitted
to
reprimand
and
overbear
others
a
man
of
impeccable
health
he
bathed
from
ice
to
ice
he
appeared
nevertheless
lean
because
of
his
shaggy
overgrown
black
beard
with
a
tinge
of
blue
in
it
he
brought
uneasiness
if
not
fear
upon
everyone
because
he
incessantly
shouted
at
someone
and
threatened
someone
with
hard
labour
in
siberia
i
come
on
business
said
peredonov
confusedly
have
you
come
with
a
confession
have
you
killed
a
man
have
you
committed
arson
have
you
robbed
the
post
asked
avinovitsky
angrily
as
he
admitted
peredonov
into
the
or
have
you
been
the
victim
of
a
crime
yourself
which
is
more
possible
in
our
town
ours
is
a
filthy
town
and
its
police
is
even
worse
i
astonished
that
you
do
find
dead
bodies
every
morning
lying
about
the
place
well
sit
down
what
is
your
business
are
you
the
criminal
or
the
victim
no
said
peredonov
i
have
done
anything
of
the
kind
now
the
who
undoubtedly
like
to
settle
my
hash
for
me
but
i
have
any
such
thing
in
mind
so
you
have
come
with
a
confession
asked
avinovitsky
no
i
ca
say
that
i
have
mumbled
peredonov
timidly
well
if
that
the
case
said
the
district
attorney
with
savage
emphasis
then
let
me
offer
you
something
he
picked
up
a
small
handbell
from
the
table
and
rang
it
no
one
came
avinovitsky
took
the
handbell
in
both
hands
raised
a
furious
racket
then
threw
the
bell
on
the
floor
stamped
his
feet
and
shouted
in
a
savage
voice
malanya
malanya
devils
beasts
demons
unhurried
footsteps
were
heard
and
a
schoolboy
came
in
son
a
stubby
boy
of
about
thirteen
years
of
age
with
an
air
of
confidence
and
he
greeted
peredonov
picked
up
the
bell
put
in
on
the
table
and
said
quietly
malanya
is
in
the
vegetable
garden
avinovitsky
recovered
his
calm
for
a
moment
and
looking
at
his
son
with
a
tenderness
that
did
not
altogether
become
his
overgrown
and
angry
face
he
said
now
run
along
sonny
and
tell
her
to
bring
us
something
to
drink
and
some
the
boy
leisurely
walked
out
of
the
room
his
father
looked
after
him
with
a
pleased
and
proud
smile
but
while
the
boy
was
still
on
the
threshold
avinovitsky
suddenly
frowned
savagely
and
shouted
in
his
terrible
voice
which
made
peredonov
tremble
look
alive
the
schoolboy
began
to
run
and
they
could
hear
how
impetuously
he
slammed
the
doors
avinovitsky
smiling
with
his
heavy
red
lips
again
renewed
his
conversation
my
heir
not
bad
eh
what
he
going
to
turn
out
like
what
do
you
say
he
may
become
a
fool
but
a
knave
a
coward
or
a
rag
never
well
a
mumbled
peredonov
people
are
trivial
nowadays
they
a
parody
of
the
human
race
roared
avinovitsky
they
consider
health
a
trifle
some
german
invented
now
i
would
have
sent
that
german
to
hard
labour
imagine
my
vladimir
suddenly
in
an
why
all
summer
he
walked
about
in
the
village
without
once
putting
his
boots
on
and
then
think
of
him
in
an
why
he
even
gets
out
of
his
bath
and
runs
naked
in
a
frost
and
rolls
in
the
snow
think
of
him
in
an
a
hundred
lashes
for
the
accursed
german
avinovitsky
passed
from
the
german
who
invented
to
other
criminals
capital
punishment
my
dear
sir
is
not
barbarism
he
shouted
science
admits
that
there
are
born
criminals
there
nothing
to
be
said
for
them
my
friend
they
ought
to
be
destroyed
and
not
supported
by
the
state
a
man
a
scoundrel
and
they
give
him
a
warm
corner
in
a
convict
prison
he
a
murderer
an
incendiary
a
seducer
but
the
must
support
him
out
of
his
pocket
it
much
juster
and
cheaper
to
hang
them
the
round
table
in
the
was
covered
with
a
white
tablecloth
with
a
red
border
and
upon
it
were
distributed
plates
with
fat
sausages
and
other
salted
smoked
and
pickled
eatables
and
decanters
and
bottles
of
various
sizes
and
forms
containing
all
sorts
of
vodkas
brandies
and
liqueurs
everything
was
to
peredonov
taste
and
even
the
slight
carelessness
of
their
arrangement
pleased
him
the
host
continued
to
shout
apropos
of
the
food
he
began
to
abuse
the
shopkeepers
and
then
for
some
reason
began
to
talk
about
ancestry
ancestry
is
a
big
thing
he
shouted
savagely
for
the
muzhiks
to
enter
the
aristocracy
is
stupid
absurd
impractical
and
immoral
the
soil
is
getting
poorer
and
the
cities
are
filled
with
unemployed
then
there
are
bad
harvests
idleness
and
suicides
how
does
that
please
you
you
may
teach
the
muzhik
as
much
as
you
like
but
do
give
him
any
rank
it
makes
a
peasantry
lose
its
best
members
and
it
always
remains
rabble
and
cattle
and
the
gentry
also
suffer
detriment
from
the
influx
of
uncultured
elements
in
his
own
village
he
was
better
than
others
but
when
he
gets
into
a
higher
rank
he
brings
into
it
something
coarse
unknightly
and
plebeian
in
the
first
case
the
most
important
things
are
gain
and
his
stomach
my
dear
fellow
the
castes
were
a
wise
institution
here
for
instance
our
lets
all
sorts
of
into
the
school
said
peredonov
angrily
there
are
even
peasant
children
there
and
many
commoners
children
fine
doings
i
must
say
shouted
the
host
there
a
circular
saying
that
we
should
admit
all
kinds
of
but
he
does
as
he
likes
complained
peredonov
he
refuses
hardly
anyone
life
is
rather
poorish
in
our
town
he
says
and
there
are
too
few
pupils
as
it
is
what
does
he
mean
by
few
it
would
be
better
if
there
were
less
it
all
we
can
do
to
correct
the
alone
there
no
time
to
read
the
they
purposely
write
dubious
words
in
their
compositions
you
have
to
look
in
grote
to
see
how
they
spelled
have
some
brandy
suggested
avinovitsky
well
what
is
your
business
with
me
i
have
enemies
growled
peredonov
as
he
looked
dejectedly
into
his
glass
of
yellow
vodka
before
drinking
it
there
was
once
a
pig
who
lived
without
enemies
said
avinovitsky
and
he
also
was
slaughtered
have
a
bit
it
was
a
very
good
pig
peredonov
took
a
slice
of
ham
and
said
they
spreading
all
sorts
of
scandal
about
me
well
as
for
gossip
i
can
assure
you
that
no
town
is
worse
shouted
the
host
what
a
town
no
matter
what
you
do
all
the
pigs
begin
to
grunt
at
you
at
once
princess
volchanskaya
has
promised
to
get
me
an
inspector
job
and
suddenly
they
all
begin
to
gossip
this
might
hurt
my
prospects
it
all
comes
from
envy
now
there
the
he
corrupted
the
entire
school
the
schoolboys
who
live
in
apartments
smoke
drink
and
run
after
girls
and
even
the
are
no
better
he
done
all
the
corrupting
himself
and
now
he
persecutes
me
it
likely
that
carried
tales
to
him
about
me
and
then
it
goes
still
farther
it
might
reach
the
princess
peredonov
dwelt
long
and
incoherently
on
his
apprehensions
avinovitsky
listened
with
an
angry
countenance
and
punctuated
his
discourse
with
exclamations
villains
scamps
children
of
herod
what
sort
of
nihilist
am
i
said
peredonov
it
ridiculous
i
have
an
official
cap
with
a
badge
but
i
do
always
wear
it
and
i
sometimes
wear
a
bowler
as
for
the
fact
that
mickiewicz
hangs
on
my
wall
i
put
him
there
because
of
his
poetry
and
not
because
he
was
a
rebel
i
have
even
read
his
well
you
caught
that
from
another
opera
said
avinovitsky
unceremoniously
herzen
published
it
and
not
mickiewicz
that
was
another
said
peredonov
mickiewicz
also
published
a
i
did
know
it
you
better
publish
the
fact
it
would
be
a
great
discovery
you
become
celebrated
it
forbidden
to
publish
it
said
peredonov
angrily
i
not
allowed
to
read
forbidden
books
and
i
never
read
them
i
a
patriot
after
lengthy
lamentations
in
which
peredonov
poured
himself
out
avinovitsky
concluded
that
someone
was
trying
to
blackmail
peredonov
and
with
this
purpose
in
view
was
spreading
rumours
about
him
in
order
to
frighten
him
and
to
prepare
a
basis
for
a
sudden
demand
for
money
that
these
rumours
did
not
reach
him
avinovitsky
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
blackmailer
was
acting
skilfully
upon
immediate
circle
because
it
was
only
necessary
to
frighten
peredonov
avinovitsky
asked
whom
do
you
suspect
peredonov
fell
into
thought
quite
by
chance
grushina
came
into
his
mind
he
recalled
confusedly
the
recent
conversation
with
her
during
which
he
interrupted
her
by
a
threat
of
informing
against
her
the
fact
that
it
was
he
who
had
threatened
to
inform
against
grushina
became
in
his
mind
a
vague
idea
of
informing
in
general
whether
he
was
to
inform
against
someone
or
whether
they
were
to
inform
against
him
was
not
clear
and
peredonov
had
no
desire
to
exert
himself
to
recall
the
matter
precisely
one
thing
was
clear
that
grushina
was
an
enemy
and
what
was
worse
she
had
seen
where
he
hid
pisarev
he
would
have
to
hide
the
books
somewhere
else
peredonov
said
at
last
well
there
grushina
yes
i
know
she
a
first
class
rogue
said
avinovitsky
sharply
she
always
coming
to
our
house
complained
peredonov
and
always
nosing
around
she
very
grasping
she
takes
all
she
can
get
possible
that
she
wants
money
from
me
in
order
to
keep
her
from
reporting
that
i
once
had
pisarev
or
perhaps
she
wants
to
marry
me
but
i
do
want
to
pay
her
and
i
have
someone
else
i
want
to
marry
let
her
inform
against
me
i
not
guilty
only
it
unpleasant
to
me
to
have
this
gossip
as
it
might
prevent
my
appointment
she
a
charlatan
said
the
district
attorney
she
wanted
to
take
up
by
cards
here
and
to
get
money
out
of
fools
but
i
asked
the
police
to
stop
it
at
that
time
they
were
sensible
and
did
what
i
told
them
even
now
she
tells
fortunes
said
peredonov
she
spread
out
the
cards
for
me
and
she
always
saw
a
long
journey
and
an
official
letter
for
me
she
knows
what
to
say
to
everybody
just
wait
she
set
a
trap
for
you
and
then
she
try
and
extort
money
from
you
then
you
come
to
me
and
i
give
her
a
hundred
of
the
hottest
lashes
said
avinovitsky
using
his
favourite
expression
this
expression
was
not
to
be
taken
literally
it
merely
meant
an
ordinary
rebuke
thus
avinovitsky
promised
his
protection
to
peredonov
but
peredonov
left
him
agitated
by
vague
fears
inspired
by
avinovitsky
loud
stern
speeches
in
this
manner
peredonov
made
a
single
visit
every
day
before
dinner
he
could
not
manage
more
than
one
because
everywhere
he
had
to
make
circumstantial
explanations
in
the
evening
as
was
his
custom
he
went
to
play
billiards
as
before
vershina
enticed
him
in
by
her
witching
invitations
as
before
routilov
praised
his
sisters
to
him
at
home
varvara
used
her
persuasive
powers
to
make
him
marry
her
sooner
but
he
came
to
no
resolution
he
indeed
thought
sometimes
that
to
marry
varvara
would
be
the
best
thing
he
could
do
but
suppose
the
princess
should
deceive
him
he
would
become
the
of
the
town
and
this
possibility
made
him
pause
the
pursuit
of
him
by
brides
the
envy
of
his
comrades
more
often
the
product
of
his
imagination
than
an
actual
fact
all
sorts
of
suspected
snares
all
this
made
his
life
wearisome
and
unhappy
like
the
weather
which
for
several
successive
days
had
been
bleak
and
often
resolved
itself
into
slow
and
scant
but
cold
and
prolonged
rains
peredonov
felt
that
life
was
becoming
a
detestable
thing
but
he
thought
that
he
would
soon
become
an
inspector
and
then
everything
would
take
a
turn
for
the
better

on

peredonov
went
to
see

reminded
one
of

cottage
in
pavlovsk

in

with
full
conveniences

though
there
was

the

of

seemed
unnecessarily
pretentious
aleksandr
mikhailovitch
veriga
received
peredonov
in
his
study
he
pretended
to
hurry
forward
to
greet
his
guest
and
gave
the
impression
that
it
was
only
his
extreme
busyness
that
kept
him
from
meeting
peredonov
earlier
veriga
held
himself
extraordinarily
erect
even
for
a
retired
cavalry
officer
it
was
whispered
that
he
wore
corsets
his
face
was
a
uniform
red
as
if
it
were
painted
his
head
was
shorn
by
the
clippers
a
convenient
method
of
minimising
his
bald
patch
his
eyes
were
grey
affable
but
cold
in
his
manner
he
was
extremely
amiable
to
everyone
but
his
views
were
decided
and
severe
a
fine
military
discipline
was
apparent
in
all
his
movements
and
there
was
a
hint
in
his
habits
of
the
future
governor
peredonov
began
to
explain
his
business
to
him
across
a
carved
oak
table
all
sorts
of
rumours
are
being
spread
about
me
and
as
a
gentleman
i
turn
to
you
all
sorts
of
nonsense
is
being
said
about
me
your
excellency
none
of
which
is
true
i
have
heard
anything
replied
veriga
smiling
amiably
and
expectantly
and
fixing
his
attentive
grey
eyes
on
peredonov
peredonov
looked
fixedly
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
said
i
never
was
a
socialist
but
if
it
sometimes
happened
that
i
said
something
i
ought
to
say
you
must
remember
that
one
is
apt
to
be
a
little
careless
in
one
young
days
but
i
given
up
thinking
of
such
things
altogether
so
you
were
quite
a
liberal
asked
veriga
with
an
amiable
smile
you
wanted
a
constitution
is
that
so
but
we
all
wanted
a
constitution
when
we
were
young
have
one
of
these
veriga
pushed
a
box
of
cigars
towards
peredonov
who
was
afraid
to
take
one
and
refused
veriga
lighted
his
own
of
course
your
excellency
admitted
peredonov
in
the
university
i
and
only
i
wanted
a
different
kind
of
constitution
from
the
others
and
what
sort
precisely
asked
veriga
with
a
shade
of
approaching
displeasure
in
his
voice
what
i
wanted
was
a
constitution
without
a
parliament
explained
peredonov
because
in
a
parliament
they
only
wrangle
veriga
eyes
lit
up
with
quiet
amusement
a
constitution
without
a
parliament
he
said
reflectively
do
you
think
it
practical
but
even
that
was
a
long
time
ago
said
peredonov
now
i
want
nothing
of
the
sort
and
he
looked
hopefully
at
veriga
veriga
blew
a
thin
wisp
of
smoke
from
his
lips
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
said
slowly
well
you
a
schoolmaster
and
my
duties
in
the
district
have
something
to
do
with
the
schools
now
in
your
opinion
to
what
kind
of
school
would
you
give
preference
to
the
parish
church
schools
or
to
the
secularised
district
schools
veriga
knocked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
and
fixed
an
amiable
but
very
attentive
gaze
on
peredonov
peredonov
frowned
looked
into
the
corners
and
said
the
district
schools
ought
to
be
reorganised
reorganised
repeated
veriga
in
an
indefinite
tone
and
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
smouldering
cigar
as
if
he
were
awaiting
a
long
explanation
the
instructors
there
are
nihilists
said
peredonov
the
instructresses
do
believe
in
god
they
stand
in
church
and
blow
their
noses
veriga
glanced
quickly
at
peredonov
and
said
with
a
smile
but
that
necessary
sometimes
you
know
yes
but
the
one
i
mean
blows
her
nose
like
a
horn
so
that
the
boys
in
the
choir
laugh
growled
peredonov
she
does
it
on
purpose
the
sort
skobotchkina
is
yes
that
is
unpleasant
said
veriga
but
in
skobotchkina
case
it
due
to
a
bad
bringing
up
she
a
girl
altogether
without
manners
but
an
enthusiastic
schoolmistress
in
any
case
it
not
nice
she
must
be
told
about
it
and
she
walks
about
in
a
red
shirt
and
sometimes
she
even
walks
barefoot
in
a
sarafan
she
practises
at
the
with
the
little
boys
it
too
free
in
the
schools
went
on
peredonov
there
no
discipline
of
any
kind
they
actually
do
want
to
chastise
the
pupils
the
muzhiks
children
should
be
treated
in
the
same
way
as
the
children
of
gentlemen
they
have
to
be
birched
veriga
looked
calmly
at
peredonov
then
as
if
feeling
uneasy
at
peredonov
untactful
remarks
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
said
in
a
cold
almost
gubernatorial
tone
i
must
say
that
i
have
noticed
many
good
qualities
in
pupils
from
district
schools
undoubtedly
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
they
do
their
work
very
conscientiously
of
course
as
everywhere
the
children
are
sometimes
guilty
of
offences
in
consequence
of
a
bad
upbringing
and
of
a
poor
environment
these
offences
can
take
a
coarse
form
all
the
more
since
among
the
russian
village
population
the
general
feelings
of
duty
of
honour
and
respect
of
private
ownership
are
little
developed
the
school
should
concern
itself
with
these
offences
attentively
and
sternly
when
all
methods
of
persuasion
are
exhausted
and
if
the
offence
is
a
severe
one
then
of
course
it
should
follow
that
in
order
not
to
ruin
the
boy
extreme
measures
must
be
taken
besides
this
should
apply
to
all
children
even
to
those
of
gentlemen
in
general
however
i
agree
with
you
that
in
schools
of
this
kind
training
is
not
satisfactorily
organised
madame
shteven
in
her
extremely
interesting
book
have
you
read
it
no
your
excellency
said
peredonov
in
confusion
i
never
have
the
time
there
so
much
work
in
school
but
i
will
read
it
well
that
not
altogether
necessary
said
veriga
with
a
smile
as
if
he
were
forbidding
peredonov
reading
it
yes
madame
shteven
recounts
with
distress
that
two
of
her
pupils
young
men
of
seventeen
were
sentenced
to
be
birched
by
the
district
court
you
see
they
were
proud
young
fellows
let
me
add
that
we
all
suffered
while
they
suffered
the
execution
of
the
sentence
this
penalty
was
afterwards
abolished
and
let
me
say
that
if
i
were
in
madame
shteven
place
i
would
like
to
let
all
russia
know
that
this
has
happened
because
just
imagine
they
were
sentenced
for
stealing
apples
observe
for
stealing
and
what
more
she
writes
that
they
were
her
very
best
pupils
yet
they
stole
the
apples
fine
bringing
up
it
must
frankly
be
admitted
that
we
do
respect
the
rights
of
ownership
veriga
rose
from
his
place
in
agitation
made
two
steps
forward
but
controlled
himself
and
immediately
sat
down
again
now
when
i
am
an
inspector
of
national
schools
i
shall
do
things
differently
said
peredonov
have
you
that
position
in
prospect
asked
veriga
yes
princess
volchanskaya
has
promised
me
veriga
assumed
an
expression
of
pleasure
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
congratulate
you
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
your
hands
things
will
be
improved
but
your
excellency
in
the
town
they
spreading
all
sorts
of
nonsense
about
me
you
ca
tell
someone
in
the
district
may
inform
against
me
and
hinder
my
appointment
and
i
have
done
anything
whom
do
you
suspect
in
the
spreading
of
these
false
rumours
asked
veriga
peredonov
mumbled
in
confusion
who
should
i
suspect
i
do
know
but
they
do
gossip
about
me
and
i
have
come
to
you
because
they
might
injure
my
position
veriga
reflected
that
he
would
not
know
who
was
spreading
the
gossip
because
he
was
not
yet
governor
he
again
assumed
his
role
of
marshal
and
made
a
speech
which
peredonov
listened
to
with
fear
and
depression
i
appreciate
the
confidence
which
you
have
shown
me
in
calling
upon
my
veriga
wanted
to
say
patronage
but
refrained
intervention
between
you
and
the
society
in
which
according
to
your
information
these
detrimental
rumours
about
you
are
being
disseminated
these
rumours
have
not
yet
reached
me
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
the
calumnies
which
are
being
spread
in
connection
with
you
dare
not
venture
to
rise
from
the
low
places
of
the
town
public
and
in
other
words
they
will
not
go
beyond
the
secret
darkness
in
which
they
are
confined
but
it
is
very
pleasant
to
me
that
you
who
hold
your
official
post
by
appointment
at
the
same
time
value
so
highly
the
importance
of
public
opinion
and
the
dignity
of
the
position
you
occupy
as
a
trainer
of
youth
one
of
those
to
whose
enlightening
solitude
we
the
parents
entrust
our
most
priceless
inheritance
namely
our
children
the
heirs
of
our
name
and
of
our
labours
as
an
official
you
have
your
chief
in
the
person
of
your
honoured
but
as
a
member
of
society
and
as
a
gentleman
you
have
always
the
privilege
of
counting
on
the
of
the
marshal
of
nobility
in
questions
concerning
your
honour
and
your
dignity
as
a
man
and
a
gentleman
as
he
continued
to
speak
veriga
rose
and
pressing
heavily
on
the
edge
of
the
table
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
looked
at
peredonov
with
that
impersonally
affable
and
attentive
expression
with
which
an
orator
looks
at
a
crowd
when
pronouncing
benevolent
official
speeches
peredonov
rose
also
and
crossing
his
hands
on
his
stomach
looked
morosely
at
the
rug
under
the
marshals
feet
veriga
went
on
i
am
glad
that
you
turned
to
me
because
in
our
time
it
is
especially
useful
to
members
of
the
official
classes
always
and
everywhere
to
remember
above
all
things
that
they
are
gentlemen
and
to
value
their
membership
of
this
class
not
only
in
the
matter
of
privileges
but
also
in
responsibilities
and
in
their
dignity
as
gentlemen
gentlemen
in
russia
as
you
know
are
of
the
civil
service
strictly
speaking
all
governmental
positions
except
the
very
lowest
it
goes
without
saying
should
be
found
only
in
gentlemen
hands
the
presence
of
commoners
in
the
government
service
constitutes
of
course
one
of
the
causes
of
undesirable
occurrences
such
as
that
which
has
disturbed
your
tranquillity
intrigue
and
calumny
these
are
the
weapons
of
people
of
lower
breed
not
brought
up
in
fine
gentlemanly
traditions
but
i
hope
that
public
opinion
will
make
itself
heard
clearly
and
loudly
on
your
behalf
and
in
this
connection
you
can
fully
count
on
my
i
thank
your
excellency
most
humbly
said
peredonov
and
i
am
glad
that
i
can
count
on
you
veriga
smiled
amiably
and
did
not
sit
down
giving
peredonov
to
understand
that
the
interview
was
closed
as
he
finished
his
speech
he
suddenly
realised
that
what
he
had
said
was
out
of
place
and
that
peredonov
was
nothing
but
a
timorous
knocking
at
doors
in
his
search
for
patronage
as
the
footman
in
the
hall
helped
him
on
with
his
coat
he
heard
the
sounds
of
a
piano
in
a
distant
room
peredonov
thought
that
in
this
house
lived
people
of
great
whose
manner
of
life
was
really
seigneurial
he
has
a
governorship
in
view
thought
peredonov
with
a
feeling
of
respectful
and
envious
astonishment
on
the
stairs
he
met
two
of
the
marshal
boys
returning
from
a
walk
with
their
tutor
peredonov
looked
at
them
with
morose
curiosity
how
clean
they
are
he
thought
there
not
a
speck
of
dirt
even
in
their
ears
how
alive
they
are
and
they
trained
to
hold
themselves
straight
as
a
taut
and
they
never
even
whipped
if
you
please
thought
peredonov
and
he
looked
angrily
after
them
as
they
ran
up
the
stairs
chattering
gaily
it
astonished
peredonov
that
the
tutor
treated
them
as
equals
he
did
not
frown
at
them
nor
did
he
scold
them
when
peredonov
returned
home
he
found
varvara
in
the
with
a
book
in
her
hands
which
was
a
rare
occurrence
varvara
was
reading
a
cookery
book
the
only
one
she
had
and
which
she
sometimes
looked
into
the
book
was
old
ragged
and
had
black
binding
the
binding
caught
peredonov
eye
and
it
depressed
him
what
are
you
reading
varvara
he
asked
angrily
what
ca
you
see
a
cookery
book
replied
varvara
i
have
time
to
read
nonsense
why
a
cookery
book
asked
peredonov
in
fright
what
do
you
mean
why
i
want
to
find
some
new
dishes
for
you
always
grumbling
about
the
food
said
varvara
with
a
sort
of
sarcastic
i
wo
eat
from
a
black
book
announced
peredonov
decisively
and
quickly
tore
the
book
from
varvara
hands
and
took
it
into
the
bedroom
a
black
book
the
idea
of
preparing
dinners
from
it
the
thought
filled
him
with
fear
it
had
come
to
that
he
was
to
be
ruined
openly
with
black
magic
i
must
destroy
this
awful
book
he
thought
and
paid
no
attention
to
varvara
grumbling
on
friday
peredonov
went
to
see
the
president
of
the
district
landlords
board
everything
in
this
house
pointed
to
a
love
of
simplicity
and
good
living
and
to
the
fact
that
the
occupants
had
public
interest
at
heart
many
objects
of
good
furniture
reminding
one
of
village
life
were
about
among
other
things
a
chair
with
a
back
made
of
a
harness
arch
and
hand
supports
resembling
axe
handles
an
inkwell
shaped
like
a
and
an
that
resembled
a
peasant
shoe
several
corn
measures
containing
samples
of
corn
were
lying
about
in
the
parlour
on
the
on
the
tables
on
the
floor
while
here
and
there
were
pieces
of
hungry
bread
dirty
lumps
that
resembled
peat
in
the
were
designs
and
models
of
agricultural
machines
several
cases
of
books
on
rural
economy
and
school
matters
encumbered
the
study
the
table
was
covered
with
papers
printed
forms
boxes
containing
cards
of
various
sizes
there
was
much
dust
and
not
a
single
picture
the
master
of
the
house
ivan
stepanovitch
kirillov
was
very
anxious
on
the
one
hand
to
be
amiable
in
the
european
fashion
on
the
other
not
to
detract
from
his
own
dignity
as
a
district
landowner
he
was
a
strange
contradiction
as
if
welded
from
two
halves
it
was
evident
from
all
his
surroundings
that
he
did
a
great
deal
of
work
with
intelligence
but
to
look
at
him
you
might
imagine
that
his
work
in
the
district
was
only
a
temporary
distraction
and
that
his
real
cares
were
somewhere
before
him
this
was
evident
in
his
eyes
which
now
and
then
stared
into
the
distance
eyes
alert
yet
inanimate
in
their
tinny
gleam
it
was
as
if
someone
had
taken
out
his
live
soul
and
put
it
into
a
long
box
and
had
replaced
it
with
a
skilful
bustling
machine
he
was
of
low
stature
thin
youngish
so
youngish
and
ruddy
that
now
and
then
he
looked
like
a
boy
who
had
glued
on
a
false
beard
and
had
assumed
manners
with
complete
success
his
movements
were
quick
but
precise
when
he
greeted
anyone
he
bowed
elaborately
and
he
seemed
to
glide
on
the
soles
of
his
fancy
boots
one
impulse
was
to
call
his
clothes
a
small
costume
he
wore
a
grey
jacket
a
shirt
of
unstarched
batiste
with
collar
a
blue
cord
tie
narrow
trousers
and
grey
socks
and
his
always
courteous
conversation
was
also
ambiguous
he
would
speak
quite
gravely
and
then
suddenly
an
ingenuous
smile
like
a
child
would
appear
and
then
next
moment
he
would
be
grave
again
his
wife
a
quiet
sedate
woman
who
seemed
older
than
her
husband
came
into
the
study
a
number
of
times
while
peredonov
was
there
and
each
time
she
asked
her
husband
for
some
detailed
information
about
the
affairs
of
the
district
their
household
in
town
was
always
confused
there
were
always
visitors
on
business
and
constant
teas
hardly
had
peredonov
seated
himself
when
they
brought
him
a
glass
of
lukewarm
tea
and
some
rolls
on
a
plate
before
peredonov
arrived
there
was
already
a
visitor
there
peredonov
knew
him
but
then
who
is
not
known
to
everyone
in
our
town
everyone
knows
everyone
else
but
some
have
quarrelled
and
broken
off
the
acquaintance
this
was
the
district
physician
georgiy
semenovitch
trepetov
a
little
man
even
smaller
than
kirillov
with
a
pimply
insignificant
face
he
wore
blue
spectacles
and
he
always
looked
under
or
to
the
side
of
them
as
if
it
were
an
effort
to
look
at
his
companion
he
was
unusually
upright
and
never
gave
a
single
kopeck
for
anyone
else
benefit
he
detested
deeply
everyone
who
was
a
government
official
he
would
go
so
far
as
to
shake
hands
at
meeting
but
stubbornly
refrained
from
conversation
for
this
he
was
reputed
a
shining
light
like
kirillov
although
he
knew
very
little
and
was
a
poor
physician
he
was
all
the
time
getting
ready
to
lead
the
simple
life
and
with
this
intention
he
looked
on
at
the
muzhiks
when
they
blew
their
noses
and
scratched
the
back
of
their
heads
and
wiped
their
mouths
with
the
back
of
their
hands
when
he
was
alone
he
sometimes
imitated
them
but
he
always
put
off
his
simplification
till
next
summer
peredonov
here
also
repeated
his
usual
complaints
against
the
town
gossip
such
as
he
had
made
during
the
last
few
days
and
against
the
envious
people
who
wanted
to
hinder
his
obtaining
an
position
at
the
beginning
kirillov
felt
rather
flattered
by
this
attention
he
exclaimed
now
you
can
see
what
goes
on
in
provincial
towns
i
always
said
that
the
one
deliverance
for
thinking
people
is
to
join
hands
and
i
glad
that
you
come
to
the
same
conclusion
trepetov
snorted
angrily
as
if
affronted
kirillov
looked
at
him
timorously
trepetov
said
with
contempt
thinking
people
and
then
he
snorted
again
after
a
short
silence
he
began
again
in
his
thin
indignant
voice
i
do
know
how
thinking
people
can
serve
a
musty
classicism
kirillov
said
irresolutely
but
georgiy
semenovitch
you
never
realise
that
a
man
does
not
always
choose
his
own
profession
trepetov
snorted
contemptuously
which
finally
settled
the
amiable
kirillov
and
became
immersed
in
a
deep
silence
kirillov
turned
to
peredonov
when
he
heard
that
he
was
talking
of
an
inspector
position
kirillov
looked
worried
he
imagined
that
peredonov
wanted
to
be
an
inspector
in
our
district
in
the
district
council
there
had
matured
a
project
to
establish
the
position
of
their
inspector
of
schools
who
was
to
be
chosen
by
the
council
the
appointment
to
be
approved
by
the
educational
commission
then
the
inspector
bogdanov
who
had
charge
of
the
schools
of
three
districts
would
be
transferred
to
one
of
the
neighbouring
towns
and
the
schools
of
our
district
would
be
turned
over
to
the
new
inspector
for
this
position
the
members
of
the
council
had
in
view
an
instructor
in
a
pedagogical
seminary
in
the
neighbouring
town
safata
i
have
patrons
said
peredonov
but
i
afraid
that
the
here
will
harm
my
chances
yes
and
other
people
too
all
sorts
of
nonsense
is
being
spread
about
me
so
that
in
case
of
any
inquiries
concerning
me
i
want
to
say
now
that
all
this
talk
is
rubbish
you
believe
any
of
it
kirillov
replied
alertly
i
have
no
time
ardalyon
borisitch
to
give
attention
to
all
the
town
rumours
and
gossip
i
up
to
my
neck
in
work
if
my
wife
did
help
me
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
but
i
am
fully
convinced
that
all
that
is
being
said
about
you
though
i
assure
you
i
have
heard
anything
is
mere
gossip
but
the
position
you
have
in
view
depend
on
me
alone
they
might
ask
you
about
it
said
peredonov
kirillov
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
and
said
of
course
they
will
but
the
real
point
at
issue
is
that
we
have
in
view
at
this
moment
kirillov
wife
appeared
at
the
door
and
said
stepan
ivanitch
just
a
moment
the
husband
went
to
her
she
whispered
to
him
in
a
worried
way
i
think
you
better
not
tell
this
creature
that
we
have
krasilnikov
in
view
i
mistrust
this
creature
he
will
try
to
spoil
chances
you
think
so
whispered
kirillov
yes
yes
you
may
be
right
an
unpleasant
business
he
clutched
his
head
his
wife
looked
at
him
with
professional
sympathy
and
said
it
is
better
to
tell
him
nothing
at
all
about
it
as
if
there
were
no
vacancy
yes
yes
you
right
whispered
kirillov
but
i
must
run
along
it
discourteous
he
ran
back
into
his
study
and
began
to
converse
amiably
with
peredonov
so
you
will
if
began
peredonov
please
rest
assured
please
rest
assured
i
have
it
in
view
said
kirillov
quickly
we
have
yet
fully
decided
this
question
peredonov
did
not
understand
to
what
question
kirillov
referred
and
he
felt
oppressed
and
apprehensive
kirillov
went
on
we
are
establishing
a
we
had
experts
from
peterburg
they
worked
at
it
the
whole
summer
it
cost
us
nine
hundred
roubles
we
preparing
now
for
the
district
meeting
it
a
remarkably
efficient
plan
all
distances
have
been
considered
and
all
school
points
have
been
mapped
out
and
kirillov
explained
the
minutely
and
at
length
that
is
the
apportioning
the
district
into
several
small
divisions
with
a
school
in
each
so
that
every
village
would
have
its
school
close
at
hand
peredonov
understood
nothing
of
this
and
became
entangled
with
his
dull
thoughts
in
the
wordy
strands
of
the
net
which
kirillov
handled
so
deftly
and
quickly
at
last
he
took
his
leave
hopelessly
oppressed
in
this
house
he
thought
they
did
not
want
to
understand
him
or
even
to
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
the
host
babbled
something
unintelligible
trepetov
snorted
angrily
for
some
reason
or
other
the
hostess
came
in
ungraciously
and
walked
out
again
strange
people
lived
in
this
house
thought
peredonov
a
lost
day
actually
means
a
nobleman
but
certain
professions
that
of
a
schoolmaster
for
instance
entitle
a
man
to
the
rank
of
dvoryanin
we
have
used
the
english
word
gentleman
to
avoid
confusing
the
reader
madame
shteven
gave
all
her
energy
to
the
education
of
peasants
but
her
efforts
were
ultimately
curtailed
by
the
authorities
very
inferior
bread
used
during
the
famine
chapter
xi
on
saturday
peredonov
prepared
to
visit
the
commissioner
of
police
though
he
is
not
so
big
a
bird
as
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
thought
peredonov
he
might
do
me
greater
harm
than
anyone
else
on
the
other
hand
he
might
help
me
a
great
deal
with
the
authorities
the
police
are
after
all
very
important
peredonov
took
from
its
box
his
official
cap
with
its
badge
he
decided
that
henceforth
he
would
wear
no
other
hat
it
was
all
very
well
for
the
to
wear
any
hat
he
liked
he
stood
well
with
the
authorities
but
peredonov
was
still
seeking
his
inspector
position
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
depend
upon
patrons
he
must
do
something
himself
to
show
his
mettle
already
several
days
earlier
before
he
had
begun
to
go
about
among
the
authorities
he
had
thought
of
this
but
somehow
his
hat
only
came
to
his
hand
now
peredonov
arranged
things
differently
he
threw
his
hat
on
top
of
the
stove
to
make
certain
that
he
would
not
pick
it
up
by
accident
varvara
was
not
at
home
klavdia
was
washing
the
floors
peredonov
went
into
the
kitchen
to
wash
his
hands
he
saw
on
the
table
there
a
roll
of
blue
paper
from
which
a
few
raisins
had
fallen
this
was
a
pound
of
raisins
bought
for
the
to
be
baked
at
home
peredonov
began
to
eat
the
raisins
as
they
were
unwashed
and
unstoned
he
quickly
and
avidly
ate
the
whole
pound
as
he
stood
at
the
table
keeping
one
eye
on
the
door
so
that
klavdia
should
not
surprise
him
then
he
carefully
folded
up
the
thick
blue
paper
and
carried
it
into
the
front
room
under
his
coat
and
there
put
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
overcoat
so
that
he
could
throw
it
away
in
the
street
and
thus
get
rid
of
all
traces
of
it
he
walked
out
soon
klavdia
went
to
get
the
raisins
and
then
began
to
hunt
for
them
unsuccessfully
in
a
frightened
way
varvara
returned
and
discovered
the
loss
of
the
raisins
and
began
to
abuse
klavdia
she
was
certain
that
klavdia
had
eaten
them
it
was
quiet
in
the
streets
with
a
slight
breeze
there
was
only
an
occasional
cloud
the
pools
were
drying
up
there
was
a
pale
glow
in
the
sky
but
peredonov
soul
was
heavily
oppressed
on
the
way
he
went
into
the
tailor
in
order
to
hurry
along
the
new
uniform
he
had
ordered
three
days
ago
as
he
walked
past
the
church
he
took
his
hat
off
and
crossed
himself
three
times
elaborately
and
sweepingly
so
that
everyone
should
see
how
the
future
inspector
walked
past
the
church
he
was
not
accustomed
to
do
it
before
but
now
he
had
to
be
on
the
it
was
possible
that
some
spy
was
walking
stealthily
behind
or
was
hiding
around
a
corner
or
behind
a
tree
and
was
watching
him
the
commissioner
of
police
lived
in
a
remote
street
of
the
town
in
the
gates
which
were
flung
wide
open
peredonov
met
a
police
constable
a
meeting
which
now
always
made
peredonov
feel
dejected
there
were
several
muzhiks
visible
in
the
courtyard
but
not
the
kind
one
meets
everywhere
these
were
an
unusually
orderly
and
quiet
sort
the
courtyard
was
dirty
carts
stood
about
covered
with
matting
in
the
dark
corridor
peredonov
met
another
police
constable
a
small
meagre
man
of
capable
yet
depressed
appearance
he
stood
motionless
and
held
under
his
arm
a
book
in
black
leather
binding
a
ragged
barefoot
girl
ran
out
from
a
side
door
and
helped
peredonov
off
with
his
coat
as
she
led
him
into
the
she
said
please
come
in
semyon
grigoryevitch
will
be
here
soon
the
ceiling
was
low
and
this
oppressed
peredonov
the
furniture
was
huddled
against
the
wall
lay
on
the
floor
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
noises
and
whisperings
could
be
heard
behind
the
walls
pale
women
and
scrofulous
boys
looked
out
from
the
doors
all
with
avid
glistening
eyes
among
the
whisperings
certain
questions
and
answers
spoken
in
a
louder
tone
could
be
heard
i
brought
where
shall
i
take
this
where
do
you
want
this
put
i
brought
it
from
ermoshkin
sidor
petrovitch
the
commissioner
soon
appeared
he
was
buttoning
up
his
uniform
and
smiling
amiably
pardon
me
for
keeping
you
waiting
he
said
as
he
pressed
hand
in
both
his
huge
grasping
hands
i
had
many
business
callers
our
work
is
such
that
it
wo
bear
delay
semyon
grigoryevitch
minchukov
a
tall
robust
man
with
a
thinness
of
hair
on
the
top
of
his
scalp
stooped
slightly
his
hands
hung
down
and
his
fingers
were
like
rakes
he
often
smiled
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
that
he
had
just
eaten
something
that
was
forbidden
but
very
pleasant
and
was
now
licking
his
lips
his
lips
were
bright
red
thick
his
nose
fleshy
his
face
was
eager
zealous
but
stupid
peredonov
was
perturbed
by
everything
he
saw
and
heard
in
this
place
he
mumbled
incoherent
words
and
as
he
sat
on
his
chair
he
tried
to
hold
his
cap
in
such
a
way
that
the
commissioner
should
see
the
badge
minchukov
sat
opposite
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
very
erect
and
kept
his
amiable
smile
while
his
fingers
quietly
moved
on
his
knees
opening
and
shutting
they
saying
i
do
know
what
about
me
said
peredonov
things
that
never
happened
i
can
do
some
informing
myself
but
i
do
want
to
i
nothing
of
what
they
say
but
i
know
what
are
behind
your
back
they
spread
all
sorts
of
scandal
and
then
laugh
in
your
face
you
must
admit
that
in
my
position
this
is
very
annoying
i
have
patronage
but
these
people
go
about
throwing
mud
at
me
all
their
following
me
about
is
useless
they
only
waste
time
and
annoy
me
wherever
you
go
the
whole
town
knows
about
it
so
i
hope
that
if
anything
happens
you
support
me
of
course
of
course
with
the
greatest
pleasure
but
how
asked
minchukov
gesticulating
with
his
large
hands
still
the
police
ought
to
know
whether
you
suspect
anyone
of
course
it
really
nothing
to
me
said
peredonov
angrily
let
them
chatter
if
they
like
but
they
might
injure
my
position
cunning
you
do
notice
that
they
all
chatter
like
routilov
for
instance
how
do
you
know
that
he
not
plotting
to
blow
up
the
treasury
it
one
way
of
shifting
the
blame
minchukov
at
first
thought
that
peredonov
was
drunk
and
talking
nonsense
then
as
he
listened
further
he
imagined
that
peredonov
was
complaining
of
someone
who
was
spreading
calumnies
about
him
and
that
he
had
come
to
ask
minchukov
to
take
certain
measures
they
young
people
continued
peredonov
thinking
of
volodin
and
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
themselves
they
plotting
against
other
people
and
are
dishonest
themselves
young
people
as
everyone
knows
are
liable
to
temptation
some
of
them
are
even
in
the
police
service
and
they
too
are
busybodies
for
a
long
time
he
talked
about
young
people
but
for
some
reason
or
other
did
not
want
to
name
volodin
at
any
rate
he
wanted
minchukov
to
understand
that
certain
young
police
officials
were
not
free
from
his
suspicions
minchukov
concluded
that
peredonov
was
hinting
at
two
young
officials
in
the
police
bureau
two
very
young
men
who
were
rather
frivolous
and
were
always
running
after
girls
peredonov
confusion
and
manifest
nervousness
infected
minchukov
i
look
into
the
matter
he
said
with
some
anxiety
for
a
moment
he
was
lost
in
thought
and
then
again
began
to
smile
i
have
two
quite
young
officials
their
mothers
milk
is
dry
on
their
lips
believe
me
one
of
them
is
still
put
in
the
corner
by
his
mother
honest
to
god
peredonov
broke
into
a
cackling
laugh
in
the
meantime
varvara
had
gone
to
grushina
house
where
she
learned
an
astonishing
piece
of
news
varvara
dmitrievna
darling
said
grushina
rapidly
before
varvara
had
time
to
cross
the
threshold
i
have
a
piece
of
news
for
you
that
will
make
you
stare
what
is
it
asked
varvara
just
think
what
low
people
there
are
in
this
world
what
tricks
they
play
to
reach
their
purpose
what
is
the
matter
just
wait
and
i
tell
you
but
first
of
all
the
cunning
grushina
gave
varvara
coffee
then
chased
her
children
out
into
the
street
which
made
the
elder
of
her
girls
unwilling
to
go
ah
you
little
brat
grushina
shouted
at
her
you
a
brat
yourself
answered
the
little
girl
and
stamped
her
foot
at
her
mother
grushina
caught
the
child
by
the
hair
pushed
her
out
the
door
and
slammed
it
the
little
beast
she
complained
to
varvara
these
children
are
a
great
worry
i
alone
with
them
and
i
never
get
any
peace
if
only
they
had
their
father
why
do
you
marry
again
then
they
have
a
father
said
varvara
you
never
can
tell
how
a
man
turn
out
varvara
dmitrievna
darling
he
might
treat
them
badly
in
the
meantime
the
little
girl
ran
back
from
the
street
and
threw
into
the
window
a
handful
of
sand
which
fell
on
to
her
mother
head
and
dress
grushina
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
and
shouted
wait
till
i
catch
you
you
little
devil
and
see
what
you
get
you
a
devil
yourself
you
silly
fool
shouted
the
little
girl
from
the
street
jumping
on
one
foot
and
clenching
her
dirty
little
fist
at
her
mother
you
just
wait
shouted
grushina
and
she
shut
the
window
then
she
sat
down
calmly
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
began
to
talk
i
have
a
piece
of
news
for
you
but
i
do
know
if
i
ought
to
tell
you
but
do
worry
varvara
dmitrievna
darling
they
wo
succeed
well
what
is
it
asked
varvara
in
affright
and
the
saucer
of
coffee
trembled
in
her
hand
you
know
that
a
young
student
by
the
name
of
pilnikov
has
just
entered
the
school
and
been
put
straight
into
the
fifth
form
as
if
he
come
from
rouban
for
his
aunt
has
bought
an
estate
in
our
district
yes
i
know
said
varvara
i
saw
him
when
he
came
with
his
aunt
such
a
pretty
boy
almost
like
a
girl
and
always
blushing
but
dearest
why
should
he
look
like
a
girl
he
is
a
girl
dressed
up
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
varvara
they
thought
of
it
on
purpose
to
catch
ardalyon
borisitch
said
grushina
quickly
with
many
gesticulations
very
happy
that
she
had
such
important
news
to
tell
you
see
this
girl
has
a
first
cousin
a
boy
an
orphan
who
went
to
school
at
rouban
and
this
girl
mother
took
him
away
from
rouban
and
used
his
papers
to
send
the
girl
here
and
you
will
notice
that
they
have
put
him
in
a
house
where
there
are
no
other
boys
he
there
alone
so
that
the
whole
matter
they
thought
would
be
kept
secret
and
how
did
you
find
out
asked
varvara
incredulously
varvara
darling
news
gets
about
quickly
it
was
suspicious
at
once
all
the
other
boys
are
like
boys
but
this
one
is
so
quiet
and
walks
about
as
if
he
had
just
been
dipped
in
the
water
to
look
at
a
fellow
and
chesty
but
his
companions
notice
that
he
very
modest
they
tell
him
a
word
and
he
blushes
at
once
they
tease
him
for
being
a
girl
they
do
it
for
a
lark
and
do
realise
that
it
the
truth
and
just
think
how
shrewd
been
why
even
the
landlady
does
know
anything
how
did
you
find
out
repeated
varvara
but
varvara
darling
what
is
there
that
i
do
know
i
know
everyone
in
the
district
why
everyone
knows
that
they
have
a
boy
at
home
the
same
age
as
this
one
why
did
they
send
them
to
school
together
they
say
that
he
was
ill
last
summer
and
that
he
was
to
spend
a
year
recuperating
and
then
go
back
to
school
but
that
all
nonsense
the
real
schoolboy
is
at
home
and
then
everyone
knows
that
they
had
a
girl
and
they
say
that
she
was
married
and
went
off
to
the
caucasus
but
that
another
lie
she
did
go
away
she
living
here
disguised
as
a
boy
but
what
the
object
of
it
asked
varvara
what
do
you
mean
the
object
said
grushina
animatedly
to
get
hold
of
one
of
the
instructors
there
are
plenty
of
them
bachelors
or
perhaps
someone
else
disguised
as
a
boy
she
could
go
to
apartments
and
there
is
much
she
could
do
you
say
she
a
pretty
girl
said
varvara
in
apprehensive
tones
rather
she
a
fabulous
beauty
said
grushina
she
may
be
a
little
constrained
now
but
just
wait
she
get
used
to
things
and
show
her
true
colours
she
turn
plenty
of
heads
in
the
town
and
just
think
how
shrewd
they
been
as
soon
as
i
found
out
about
this
i
tried
to
meet
his
landlady
or
perhaps
i
should
say
her
landlady
it
a
affair
pah
god
help
us
said
varvara
i
went
to
vespers
at
the
parish
church
on
pantelemon
day
she
very
pious
vassilyevna
i
say
to
her
do
you
keep
only
one
student
in
your
house
now
seems
to
me
i
say
to
her
one
is
not
enough
for
you
and
she
says
should
i
have
any
more
they
a
great
trouble
and
so
i
say
in
past
years
you
used
to
have
two
or
three
and
then
she
says
just
imagine
varvara
darling
stipulated
that
sashenka
alone
should
live
in
my
house
they
are
people
she
says
to
me
they
pay
me
a
little
more
as
if
they
were
afraid
that
the
other
boys
would
do
him
harm
now
what
do
you
think
of
that
are
they
sly
blighters
said
varvara
indignantly
well
did
you
tell
her
that
he
was
a
wench
i
said
to
her
vassilyevna
are
you
sure
they
have
foisted
a
girl
upon
you
instead
of
a
boy
well
and
what
did
she
say
she
thought
at
first
that
i
was
joking
and
she
laughs
then
i
say
to
her
more
seriously
dear
olga
vassilyevna
i
say
know
they
say
that
this
is
a
girl
but
she
would
believe
me
she
says
put
that
into
your
head
i
not
blind
this
tale
left
varvara
dumbfounded
she
believed
the
whole
story
just
as
she
heard
it
and
she
believed
that
an
assault
from
yet
another
side
was
being
prepared
for
her
intended
husband
she
must
somehow
have
the
mask
torn
off
this
disguised
girl
as
quickly
as
possible
for
a
long
time
they
deliberated
as
to
how
this
was
to
be
done
but
so
far
they
could
not
think
of
any
way
when
varvara
got
home
her
annoyance
was
further
increased
by
the
disappearance
of
the
raisins
when
peredonov
returned
varvara
quickly
and
agitatedly
told
him
that
klavdia
had
hidden
away
somewhere
the
pound
of
raisins
and
would
not
admit
it
and
what
is
more
said
varvara
she
suggests
that
they
been
eaten
by
the
master
she
says
that
you
were
in
the
kitchen
for
some
reason
or
other
when
she
was
washing
the
floors
and
that
you
stopped
there
for
a
long
time
i
did
stop
there
at
all
long
said
peredonov
glumly
i
only
washed
my
hands
there
and
i
did
see
any
raisins
klavdiushka
klavdiushka
shouted
varvara
master
says
he
even
see
the
raisins
that
means
you
must
have
hidden
them
somewhere
klavdia
showed
her
reddened
face
from
the
kitchen
i
did
take
your
raisins
she
shouted
in
a
voice
pay
for
them
but
i
did
take
them
you
pay
for
them
all
right
shouted
varvara
angrily
i
not
obliged
to
feed
you
on
raisins
peredonov
burst
out
laughing
and
shouted
diushka
got
away
with
a
whole
pound
of
raisins
heartless
wretches
shouted
klavdia
and
slammed
the
door
after
dinner
varvara
could
not
help
telling
peredonov
what
she
had
heard
about
pilnikov
she
did
not
stop
to
reflect
whether
this
would
help
her
or
do
her
harm
or
how
peredonov
would
act
she
spoke
simply
from
malice
peredonov
tried
to
recall
pilnikov
to
his
mind
but
somehow
he
could
not
clearly
visualise
him
until
now
he
had
given
little
attention
to
this
new
pupil
and
detested
him
for
his
prettiness
and
cleanness
and
because
he
conducted
himself
so
quietly
worked
well
and
was
the
youngest
of
the
students
in
the
fifth
form
but
now
varvara
story
aroused
in
him
a
mischievous
curiosity
immodest
thoughts
slowly
stirred
in
his
obscure
mind
i
must
go
to
vespers
he
thought
and
take
a
look
at
this
disguised
girl
suddenly
klavdia
came
in
rejoicing
and
threw
on
the
table
a
piece
of
crumpled
blue
paper
and
exclaimed
there
you
blamed
me
for
taking
the
raisins
but
what
this
as
if
i
needed
your
raisins
peredonov
guessed
what
was
the
matter
he
had
forgotten
to
throw
the
paper
bag
away
in
the
street
and
now
klavdia
had
found
it
in
his
overcoat
pocket
oh
the
devil
he
exclaimed
what
is
it
where
did
you
get
it
cried
varvara
i
found
it
in
ardalyon
borisitch
pocket
said
klavdia
triumphantly
he
ate
them
himself
and
i
blamed
for
it
everyone
knows
that
ardalyon
borisitch
likes
sweet
things
but
why
should
it
be
put
on
others
when
do
go
so
fast
said
peredonov
you
telling
lies
you
put
it
there
yourself
i
did
touch
them
why
should
i
do
that
god
forgive
you
said
klavdia
nonplussed
how
did
you
dare
to
touch
other
people
pockets
shouted
varvara
are
you
looking
for
money
i
do
touch
other
people
pockets
answered
klavdia
angrily
i
took
the
coat
down
to
brush
it
it
was
covered
with
mud
but
why
did
you
put
your
hand
in
the
pocket
it
fell
out
of
the
pocket
by
itself
said
klavdia
defending
herself
you
lying
diushka
said
peredonov
i
not
a
what
sneerers
you
are
shouted
klavdia
the
devil
take
you
i
pay
for
those
raisins
and
you
can
choke
on
them
you
gorged
on
them
yourself
and
now
i
must
pay
for
them
yes
i
pay
for
them
you
no
conscience
you
no
shame
and
yet
you
call
yourself
gentry
klavdia
went
into
the
kitchen
crying
and
abusing
them
peredonov
suddenly
began
to
laugh
and
said
she
very
touchy
is
she
yes
let
her
pay
for
them
said
varvara
if
you
let
them
eat
anything
these
ravenous
devils
and
for
a
long
time
afterwards
they
tormented
klavdia
with
having
eaten
a
pound
of
raisins
they
deducted
the
price
of
the
raisins
from
her
wages
and
told
the
story
to
everyone
who
came
to
the
house
the
cat
as
if
attracted
by
this
uproar
had
left
the
kitchen
sidling
along
the
walls
sat
down
near
peredonov
and
looked
at
him
with
its
avid
evil
eyes
peredonov
bent
down
to
catch
the
animal
which
snarled
savagely
scratched
peredonov
hand
and
ran
and
hid
behind
the
sideboard
it
peeped
out
from
there
and
its
narrow
green
eyes
gleamed
it
might
be
a
thought
peredonov
in
fear
in
the
meantime
varvara
still
thinking
about
pilnikov
said
why
do
you
spend
all
your
evenings
playing
billiards
you
might
occasionally
drop
in
at
the
students
lodgings
they
know
that
the
instructors
rarely
come
to
see
them
and
that
the
inspector
only
comes
once
a
year
so
that
all
sorts
of
indecencies
and
drunkenness
go
on
you
might
for
instance
call
on
this
disguised
girl
you
better
go
late
about
that
would
be
a
good
time
to
find
her
out
and
embarrass
her
peredonov
reflected
a
while
and
then
burst
out
laughing
varvara
certainly
a
sly
rogue
he
thought
she
can
teach
me
a
thing
or
two
chapter
xii
peredonov
went
to
vespers
in
the
school
chapel
there
he
placed
himself
behind
the
students
and
looked
attentively
to
see
how
they
behaved
it
seemed
to
him
that
some
of
them
were
mischievous
talked
whispered
and
laughed
he
noticed
who
they
were
and
tried
to
memorise
their
names
there
were
a
number
of
them
and
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
brought
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
with
him
to
write
their
names
down
he
felt
depressed
because
the
students
behaved
so
badly
and
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
it
although
the
and
the
inspector
with
their
wives
and
children
were
present
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
students
were
orderly
and
quiet
some
of
them
crossed
themselves
absently
with
their
thoughts
far
away
from
the
church
others
prayed
diligently
only
very
rarely
did
one
of
them
whisper
to
his
neighbour
two
or
three
words
perhaps
without
turning
their
heads
and
the
other
always
replied
as
briefly
and
quietly
sometimes
with
no
more
than
a
quick
movement
a
look
a
shrug
or
a
smile
but
these
insignificant
movements
unnoticed
by
the
form
master
aroused
an
illusion
of
great
disorder
in
peredonov
dull
perturbed
mind
even
in
his
tranquil
moments
peredonov
like
all
coarse
people
could
not
appraise
small
incidents
either
he
did
not
notice
them
at
all
or
he
exaggerated
their
importance
now
that
he
was
agitated
by
expectations
his
perceptions
served
him
even
worse
and
little
by
little
the
whole
reality
became
obscured
before
him
by
a
thin
smoke
of
detestable
and
evil
illusions
and
after
all
what
were
the
students
to
peredonov
even
earlier
were
they
not
merely
an
apparatus
for
the
spreading
of
ink
and
paper
by
means
of
the
pen
and
for
the
retelling
in
language
what
had
been
said
before
in
live
human
speech
in
his
whole
educational
career
peredonov
never
for
a
moment
reflected
that
the
students
were
the
same
human
beings
as
only
bearded
students
with
awakened
inclinations
towards
women
suddenly
became
in
his
eyes
equal
to
himself
after
he
had
stood
behind
the
boys
for
some
time
and
gathered
enough
of
depressing
reflections
peredonov
moved
forward
toward
the
middle
rows
there
on
the
very
edge
to
the
right
stood
sasha
pilnikov
he
was
praying
earnestly
and
often
went
down
on
his
knees
peredonov
watched
him
and
it
gave
him
pleasure
to
see
sasha
on
his
knees
like
one
chastised
and
looking
before
him
at
the
resplendent
altar
with
a
concerned
and
appealing
expression
on
his
face
with
entreaty
and
sadness
in
his
black
eyes
shaded
by
long
intensely
black
eyelashes
and
graceful
his
chest
standing
out
broad
and
high
as
he
rested
there
calm
and
erect
on
his
knees
as
if
under
some
sternly
observing
eye
he
appeared
at
that
moment
to
peredonov
altogether
like
a
girl
peredonov
now
decided
to
go
directly
after
vespers
to
pilnikov
rooms
they
began
to
leave
the
church
it
was
noticed
that
peredonov
no
longer
wore
a
hat
but
a
cap
with
a
badge
routilov
asked
laughingly
ardalyon
borisitch
how
is
that
you
strolling
about
with
your
badge
nowadays
that
comes
of
having
an
inspectorship
in
view
will
the
soldiers
have
to
salute
you
now
asked
valeria
with
pretended
ingenuousness
what
nonsense
said
peredonov
angrily
you
do
understand
valerotchka
said
darya
why
do
you
say
soldiers
but
ardalyon
borisitch
will
get
a
great
deal
more
respect
from
his
pupils
now
than
before
liudmilla
laughed
peredonov
made
haste
to
take
leave
of
them
in
order
to
get
away
from
their
sarcasms
it
was
too
early
to
go
to
pilnikov
and
he
had
no
desire
to
go
home
peredonov
walked
about
the
dark
streets
wondering
how
he
could
waste
an
hour
there
were
many
houses
and
lights
shone
from
many
windows
sometimes
voices
could
be
heard
from
the
open
windows
the
walked
in
the
streets
and
gates
and
doors
could
be
heard
opening
and
shutting
all
around
lived
people
strange
and
hostile
to
peredonov
and
it
was
possible
that
at
this
very
moment
some
of
them
were
devising
evil
against
him
perhaps
someone
was
wondering
why
he
walked
alone
at
this
late
hour
and
where
he
was
going
it
seemed
to
peredonov
that
someone
was
following
him
stealthily
he
began
to
feel
depressed
he
walked
on
hurriedly
and
aimlessly
he
thought
that
every
house
here
had
its
dead
and
that
all
who
lived
in
the
old
houses
fifty
years
ago
were
now
dead
some
of
the
dead
he
still
remembered
when
a
man
dies
his
house
should
be
burnt
afterwards
thought
peredonov
dejectedly
because
it
makes
one
feel
horribly
olga
vassilyevna
kokovkina
with
whom
sasha
pilnikov
lived
was
a
paymaster
widow
her
husband
had
left
her
a
pension
and
a
small
house
which
was
sufficiently
large
to
accommodate
two
or
three
lodgers
but
she
gave
preference
to
students
it
so
happened
that
the
quietest
boys
were
always
placed
at
her
house
those
who
studied
diligently
and
completed
their
courses
at
other
students
lodgings
there
were
a
considerable
number
of
boys
who
went
from
one
school
to
another
and
always
left
their
studies
unfinished
olga
vassilyevna
a
lean
tall
and
erect
old
woman
with
a
face
to
which
however
she
tried
to
give
a
stern
expression
and
sasha
pilnikov
a
youngster
carefully
trained
by
his
aunt
sat
at
the
supper
table
that
evening
it
was
sasha
turn
to
supply
the
jam
which
he
had
bought
in
the
village
and
therefore
he
felt
as
if
he
were
the
host
and
ceremoniously
attended
to
olga
vassilyevna
and
his
black
eyes
shone
brightly
a
ring
at
the
door
was
heard
and
a
moment
afterwards
peredonov
appeared
in
the
kokovkina
was
astonished
at
such
a
late
visit
i
come
to
take
a
look
at
our
pupil
he
said
and
to
see
how
he
lives
kokovkina
asked
peredonov
to
take
some
refreshment
but
he
refused
he
wanted
them
to
finish
their
supper
so
that
he
could
be
alone
with
his
pupil
they
finished
their
supper
and
went
into
sasha
room
but
kokovkina
did
not
leave
them
and
talked
incessantly
peredonov
looked
morosely
at
sasha
who
was
timidly
silent
nothing
will
come
of
this
visit
thought
peredonov
with
annoyance
the
for
some
reason
or
other
called
out
for
kokovkina
sasha
looked
dejectedly
after
her
his
eyes
grew
dull
they
were
covered
by
his
eyelashes
and
it
seemed
that
these
eyelashes
which
were
very
long
threw
a
shadow
on
his
smooth
and
suddenly
pallid
face
he
felt
uneasy
in
the
presence
of
this
morose
man
peredonov
sat
down
beside
him
put
his
arm
awkwardly
around
him
and
without
altering
the
immobile
expression
on
his
face
asked
well
sashenka
has
the
little
girl
said
her
prayers
yet
sasha
shamefaced
and
frightened
looked
at
peredonov
and
was
silent
well
eh
asked
peredonov
yes
said
sasha
at
last
what
red
cheeks
you
got
said
peredonov
well
a
you
are
a
little
girl
yes
a
girl
you
rogue
no
i
not
a
girl
said
sasha
and
suddenly
angry
at
his
own
timidity
he
asked
in
a
shrill
voice
how
am
i
like
a
girl
the
fault
of
your
students
who
try
to
tease
me
because
i
do
say
nasty
words
i
not
used
to
saying
them
why
should
i
say
them
will
mamma
punish
you
asked
peredonov
i
have
no
mother
said
sasha
my
mother
died
long
ago
i
have
only
an
aunt
well
then
will
aunt
punish
you
of
course
she
punish
me
if
i
use
nasty
words
it
is
nice
is
it
and
how
will
your
aunt
know
i
do
like
it
myself
said
sasha
quietly
and
there
are
several
ways
aunt
may
find
out
i
might
give
myself
away
and
which
of
your
companions
say
nasty
words
asked
peredonov
sasha
again
blushed
and
was
silent
well
go
on
insisted
peredonov
you
got
to
tell
me
you
conceal
things
no
one
says
them
said
sasha
in
confusion
but
you
yourself
just
complained
i
did
not
complain
why
do
you
deny
it
said
peredonov
angrily
sasha
felt
himself
caught
in
a
detestable
trap
he
said
i
only
explained
to
you
why
some
of
my
companions
tease
me
with
being
a
girl
but
i
did
want
to
tell
tales
about
them
so
that
it
and
why
so
asked
peredonov
indignantly
it
is
nice
said
sasha
with
an
annoyed
smile
well
i
shall
speak
to
the
and
he
make
you
tell
said
peredonov
spitefully
sasha
looked
at
peredonov
with
anger
in
his
eyes
no
please
do
tell
him
ardalyon
borisitch
he
entreated
and
from
the
agitated
tones
of
his
voice
it
could
be
perceived
that
he
tried
to
entreat
but
that
he
wanted
to
shout
fierce
insulting
words
no
i
tell
then
you
see
whether
you
can
hide
nasty
things
you
should
have
complained
of
them
at
once
but
just
wait
you
get
it
sasha
rose
and
in
confusion
he
shifted
his
belt
kokovkina
entered
your
quiet
one
is
a
good
boy
i
must
say
said
peredonov
malignantly
kokovkina
was
frightened
she
quickly
walked
up
to
sasha
and
sat
down
at
his
side
in
her
agitation
she
always
stumbled
and
asked
timorously
what
the
matter
ardalyon
borisitch
what
has
he
done
you
better
ask
him
replied
peredonov
with
morose
spite
what
is
it
sashenka
what
have
you
done
asked
kokovkina
touching
sasha
elbow
i
do
know
said
sasha
and
began
to
cry
well
what
the
matter
what
is
it
why
are
you
crying
asked
kokovkina
she
laid
her
hands
on
the
boy
shoulders
and
pulled
him
towards
her
she
did
not
notice
that
this
disturbed
him
further
he
stood
there
stooping
and
kept
his
handkerchief
to
his
eyes
peredonov
explained
he
being
taught
nasty
words
in
the
and
he
wo
say
who
it
is
he
ought
to
conceal
things
he
not
only
learns
nasty
words
himself
but
he
shields
the
other
boys
oh
sashenka
sashenka
how
could
you
do
it
are
you
ashamed
said
kokovkina
in
a
flustered
way
as
she
released
sasha
i
did
nothing
replied
sasha
crying
i
did
nothing
that
was
wrong
indeed
they
tease
me
because
i
do
use
bad
words
who
says
bad
words
asked
peredonov
again
no
one
says
them
exclaimed
sasha
in
despair
there
you
see
how
he
lies
said
peredonov
he
ought
to
be
well
punished
he
must
tell
the
truth
as
to
who
says
these
nasty
words
because
our
might
get
a
bad
name
and
we
could
do
nothing
against
it
you
had
better
let
him
go
ardalyon
borisitch
said
kokovkina
how
can
he
inform
against
his
companions
they
make
his
life
unbearable
if
he
did
he
obliged
to
tell
said
peredonov
angrily
because
it
would
be
very
useful
we
will
take
measures
to
stop
it
but
they
beat
him
said
kokovkina
irresolutely
they
wo
dare
if
he
afraid
then
let
him
tell
in
secret
well
sashenka

in
secret

one
will
know
that

sasha
cried
silently
kokovkina
drew
him
to
her
embraced
him
and
for
a
long
time
whispered
in
his
ear
but
he
shook
his
head
negatively
he
does
want
to
said
kokovkina
try
a
birch
on
him
then
he
talk
said
peredonov
savagely
bring
me
a
birch
i
make
him
talk
olga
vassilyevna
but
why
exclaimed
sasha
kokovkina
rose
and
embraced
him
that
enough
crying
she
said
gently
but
sternly
no
one
shall
touch
you
as
you
like
said
peredonov
but
i
must
tell
the
i
thought
it
might
have
been
better
to
keep
at
home
perhaps
your
sashenka
really
knows
more
than
he
tell
we
do
know
yet
why
teased
with
being
a
girl
perhaps
it
for
something
else
entirely
perhaps
it
not
he
who
being
taught
but
he
who
corrupting
others
peredonov
left
the
room
angrily
kokovkina
followed
him
she
said
reproachfully
ardalyon
borisitch
how
can
you
worry
a
boy
for
i
do
know
what
it
as
well
that
he
does
understand
what
you
say
well
said
peredonov
angrily
but
i
shall
tell
the
this
must
be
investigated
he
left
kokovkina
went
to
console
sasha
sasha
sat
gloomily
at
his
window
and
looked
at
the
starry
sky
his
black
eyes
were
now
tranquil
and
strangely
sad
kokovkina
silently
stroked
his
head
it
my
fault
he
said
i
told
him
why
they
were
teasing
me
and
he
would
let
it
drop
he
a
very
coarse
man
not
one
of
the
students
likes
him
the
next
day
peredonov
and
varvara
moved
into
their
new
house
ershova
stood
at
the
gate
and
exchanged
violently
abusive
words
with
varvara
peredonov
hid
himself
behind
the
furniture
vans
as
soon
as
they
got
in
they
had
their
new
house
blessed
it
was
necessary
according
to
peredonov
calculations
to
show
that
he
was
one
of
the
faithful
during
this
ceremony
the
fumes
of
incense
made
his
head
dizzy
and
induced
in
him
a
religious
mood
one
strange
circumstance
puzzled
him
there
came
running
from
somewhere
a
strange
indescribable
creature
a
small
grey
and
nimble
it
nodded
and
it
trembled
and
circled
round
peredonov
when
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
catch
it
it
glided
swiftly
out
of
sight
hid
itself
behind
the
door
or
the
sideboard
but
reappeared
a
moment
later
and
trembled
and
mocked
again
the
grey
featureless
nimble
creature
at
last
when
the
blessing
was
over
peredonov
suspecting
something
repeated
a
charm
in
a
whisper
the
nedotikomka
hissed
very
very
quietly
shrivelled
into
a
little
ball
and
rolled
away
behind
the
door
peredonov
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
yes
it
good
that
it
has
rolled
away
altogether
but
it
possible
that
it
lives
in
this
house
somewhere
under
the
floor
and
will
come
out
again
to
mock
at
me
peredonov
felt
cold
and
depressed
what
the
use
of
all
these
unclean
demons
in
the
world
he
thought
when
the
ceremony
was
over
and
the
visitors
gone
peredonov
thought
a
longtime
as
to
where
the
nedotikomka
could
have
hidden
itself
varvara
left
with
grushina
and
peredonov
began
to
search
and
rummage
among
her
things
i
wonder
if
varvara
carried
it
away
in
her
pocket
thought
peredonov
it
does
need
much
room
it
could
hide
in
a
pocket
and
stay
there
until
its
time
comes
to
show
itself
one
of
varvara
dresses
attracted
peredonov
attention
it
was
made
up
of
flounces
bows
and
ribbons
as
if
made
purposely
to
hide
something
peredonov
examined
it
for
a
long
time
then
by
force
and
with
the
help
of
a
knife
he
partly
tore
partly
cut
away
the
pocket
and
threw
it
on
the
stove
and
then
began
to
tear
and
cut
the
whole
dress
into
small
pieces
strange
confused
thoughts
wandered
through
his
brain
and
his
soul
felt
hopelessly
gloomy
soon
varvara
returned
peredonov
was
still
cutting
the
remains
of
the
dress
into
shreds
she
thought
he
was
drunk
and
began
to
abuse
him
peredonov
listened
for
a
long
time
and
said
at
last
what
are
you
barking
at
fool
perhaps
you
carrying
a
devil
in
your
pocket
i
must
think
about
it
and
see
what
going
on
here
varvara
was
taken
aback
gratified
by
the
impression
he
had
produced
he
made
haste
to
find
his
cap
and
went
out
to
play
billiards
varvara
ran
out
into
the
passage
and
while
peredonov
was
putting
on
his
overcoat
she
shouted
it
you
perhaps
who
carrying
the
devil
in
your
pocket
but
i
have
got
any
kind
of
devil
where
should
i
get
your
devil
shall
i
order
one
for
you
from
holland
the
young
official
cherepnin
the
man
about
whom
vershina
had
told
the
story
of
his
looking
into
the
window
had
paid
attentions
to
her
when
she
first
became
a
widow
vershina
did
not
object
to
marrying
a
second
time
but
cherepnin
seemed
to
her
utterly
worthless
therefore
he
felt
maliciously
towards
her
with
great
delight
he
fell
in
with
volodin
suggestion
of
smearing
vershina
gate
with
tar
he
agreed
but
later
he
felt
some
qualms
suppose
they
should
catch
him
it
would
be
awkward
after
all
he
was
an
official
he
decided
to
shift
the
matter
on
to
other
shoulders
he
bribed
two
young
scapegraces
with
a
quarter
of
a
rouble
and
promised
them
another
fifteen
kopecks
each
if
they
would
get
it
done
if
they
would
do
it
one
dark
night
if
anyone
in
vershina
house
had
opened
the
window
after
midnight
he
might
have
heard
the
rustle
of
light
feet
on
the
wood
pavement
a
quiet
whispering
and
certain
soft
sounds
giving
the
impression
that
the
fence
was
being
swept
then
a
slight
clinking
a
fast
pattering
of
feet
going
faster
and
faster
distant
laughing
and
the
angry
barking
of
dogs
but
no
one
opened
the
window
and
in
the
morning
the
gate
and
the
fence
between
the
garden
and
the
yard
were
covered
with
coloured
tar
indecent
words
were
written
in
tar
on
the
gates
stopped
and
laughed
the
word
soon
went
round
and
many
inquisitive
people
came
vershina
walked
about
quickly
in
the
garden
and
smoked
her
smile
was
even
more
wry
than
usual
and
she
mumbled
angrily
marta
did
not
leave
her
room
and
wept
bitterly
the
marya
tried
to
wash
off
the
tar
and
some
words
of
abuse
passed
between
her
and
the
onlookers
who
were
laughing
uproariously
that
same
day
cherepnin
told
volodin
what
he
had
done
volodin
wasted
no
time
in
telling
peredonov
both
of
them
knew
the
boys
who
were
for
their
daring
pranks
peredonov
on
his
way
to
billiards
stopped
at
vershina
the
weather
was
gloomy
so
vershina
and
marta
sat
in
the
your
gates
have
been
smeared
with
tar
said
peredonov
marta
blushed
vershina
quickly
related
how
they
had
got
up
in
the
morning
and
saw
people
laughing
at
the
gate
and
how
marya
had
washed
the
fence
i
know
who
did
it
said
peredonov
vershina
looked
questioningly
at
peredonov
how
did
you
find
out
she
asked
i
found
out
all
right
tell
us
then
who
did
it
said
marta
crossly
she
had
become
altogether
unattractive
because
she
now
had
eyes
with
red
swollen
eyelids
peredonov
replied
of
course
i
tell
you
i
come
for
that
reason
such
impertinent
fellows
ought
to
be
punished
but
you
must
promise
not
to
say
who
told
you
but
why
ardalyon
borisitch
asked
vershina
in
astonishment
peredonov
kept
significantly
silent
then
he
said
in
explanation
they
such
that
they
might
break
my
head
if
they
found
i
given
them
away
vershina
promised
and
do
you
tell
either
said
peredonov
to
marta
very
well
i
wo
tell
marta
agreed
quickly
because
she
wanted
to
know
as
quickly
as
possible
who
had
done
it
she
thought
they
ought
to
be
made
to
suffer
a
cruel
and
ignominious
punishment
no
you
better
swear
said
peredonov
cautiously
well
honest
to
god
i
wo
tell
anyone
said
marta
trying
to
convince
him
but
tell
us
quickly
vladya
was
listening
behind
the
door
he
was
glad
that
he
had
not
thought
of
going
into
the
he
would
not
be
compelled
to
promise
and
he
could
tell
it
to
anyone
he
liked
and
he
smiled
with
delight
to
think
that
he
would
be
avenged
on
peredonov
last
night
about
one
i
was
going
home
along
your
street
began
peredonov
and
i
heard
someone
moving
by
your
gate
i
thought
at
first
it
was
thieves
shall
i
do
i
thought
when
suddenly
i
heard
them
running
straight
towards
me
i
pressed
close
against
the
wall
and
they
did
see
me
but
i
recognised
them
one
had
a
brush
and
the
other
had
a
pail
they
rascals
the
sons
of
avdeyev
the
blacksmith
they
ran
and
i
heard
one
say
to
the
other
wasted
the
night
he
said
earned
kopecks
i
wanted
to
catch
one
of
them
but
i
was
afraid
they
would
smear
my
face
and
besides
i
had
a
new
overcoat
on
no
sooner
had
peredonov
gone
than
vershina
went
to
the
commissioner
of
police
with
a
complaint
the
commissioner
minchukov
sent
a
constable
for
avdeyev
and
his
sons
the
boys
came
boldly
thinking
they
were
suspected
on
account
of
previous
pranks
avdeyev
a
tall
dejected
old
man
was
on
the
other
hand
fully
convinced
that
his
sons
were
guilty
of
some
fresh
mischief
the
commissioner
told
avdeyev
of
what
his
sons
were
accused
and
avdeyev
replied
i
ca
control
them
do
what
you
like
with
them
i
already
hurt
my
hands
beating
them
it
not
our
doing
announced
the
elder
boy
nil
who
had
curly
red
hair
no
matter
who
does
a
thing
we
blamed
for
it
said
ilya
the
younger
whose
hair
was
also
curly
but
white
we
once
done
something
and
now
we
have
to
answer
for
everything
minchukov
smiled
amiably
shook
his
head
and
said
you
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
there
nothing
to
confess
said
nil
nothing
who
gave
you
kopecks
for
your
work
eh
and
seeing
from
the
boys
momentary
confusion
that
they
were
guilty
minchukov
said
to
vershina
it
obvious
that
they
did
it
the
boys
renewed
their
denials
they
were
taken
into
a
small
room
and
whipped
not
being
able
to
endure
the
pain
they
confessed
but
even
then
they
were
unwilling
to
say
who
had
given
them
the
money
we
did
it
on
our
own
they
said
they
were
whipped
again
until
they
confessed
that
cherepnin
had
given
them
the
money
the
boys
were
then
turned
over
to
their
father
well
we
punished
them
that
is
their
father
punished
them
said
the
commissioner
to
vershina
and
now
you
know
who
responsible
i
wo
let
that
cherepnin
off
easily
said
vershina
i
prosecute
him
i
should
advise
you
to
natalya
afanasyevna
said
minchukov
abruptly
you
better
let
the
thing
drop
what
let
such
wretches
go
no
never
exclaimed
vershina
after
all
you
have
had
no
real
proof
said
the
commissioner
quietly
what
do
you
mean
by
no
proof
when
the
boys
themselves
have
confessed
it
that
does
count
they
might
deny
it
before
the
judge
and
there
be
no
one
to
flog
them
there
how
can
they
deny
it
there
are
the
constables
who
were
witnesses
said
vershina
confidently
where
are
your
witnesses
when
you
beat
a
man
he
confess
anything
even
something
that
never
happened
they
rascals
of
course
and
they
got
what
they
deserved
but
you
get
nothing
out
of
them
in
court
minchukov
smiled
and
looked
calmly
at
vershina
vershina
left
the
commissioner
very
dissatisfied
but
after
reflection
admitted
to
herself
that
it
was
difficult
to
accuse
cherepnin
and
that
only
publicity
and
scandal
would
come
of
it
an
invention
of
the
author
the
word
means
the
it
is
presumably
an
elemental
a
symbol
of
the
evil
of
the
world

chapter
xiii
towards
evening
peredonov
appeared
before
the
to
talk
on
business
the
nikolai
vlasyevitch
khripatch
had
a
certain
number
of
rules
which
were
sufficiently
practical
and
not
difficult
to
keep
he
calmly
fulfilled
all
the
school
laws
and
regulations
and
also
kept
to
the
rules
of
a
mild
liberalism
this
was
why
the
school
authorities
the
parents
and
the
students
were
equally
satisfied
with
the
he
had
no
moments
of
doubt
no
indecisions
and
no
hesitations
what
was
the
use
of
them
one
could
always
rely
on
the
decisions
of
the
pedagogical
council
or
on
the
instructions
of
the
educational
authorities
he
was
no
less
calm
and
correct
in
his
personal
relations
his
very
appearance
gave
the
impression
of
and
steadiness
he
was
short
robust
active
with
keen
eyes
and
with
a
confident
voice
he
seemed
a
man
who
ordered
his
life
well
and
who
was
always
ready
to
improve
there
were
many
books
on
the
shelves
in
his
study
he
made
notes
from
them
when
he
had
accumulated
a
sufficient
number
of
notes
he
would
put
them
in
order
and
paraphrase
them
that
was
how
a
was
compiled
published
and
circulated
of
course
not
so
successfully
as
the
of
ushinsky
and
evtoushevsky
but
still
they
were
not
a
failure
sometimes
he
put
together
chiefly
from
foreign
books
a
compilation
which
was
very
respectable
and
quite
unnecessary
to
anyone
and
published
it
in
a
periodical
equally
respectable
and
equally
unnecessary
he
had
a
number
of
children
and
all
of
them
boys
and
girls
already
gave
indication
of
various
talents
some
wrote
verses
some
drew
some
made
rapid
progress
in
music
peredonov
said
morosely
you
always
down
on
me
nikolai
vlasyevitch
perhaps
someone
has
been
slandering
me
to
you
but
i
done
nothing
of
the
kind
i
beg
your
pardon
the
interrupted
him
i
understand
what
slanders
you
have
in
mind
in
the
management
of
the
entrusted
to
me
i
make
use
of
my
own
observations
and
i
dare
hope
that
my
educational
experience
is
sufficient
to
estimate
with
proper
correctness
what
i
see
and
what
i
hear
all
the
more
in
view
of
my
close
attention
to
my
duties
which
i
have
made
an
unbreakable
rule
khripatch
said
this
quickly
and
decisively
and
his
voice
sounded
dry
and
clear
like
the
sharp
noise
given
out
by
a
zinc
bar
when
bent
he
went
on
as
far
as
it
concerns
my
personal
opinion
of
you
i
still
continue
to
think
that
there
are
sad
lapses
in
your
professional
activity
yes
said
peredonov
morosely
you
taken
it
into
your
head
that
i
good
for
nothing
yet
i
always
preoccupied
with
the
khripatch
lifted
his
eyebrows
in
astonishment
and
glanced
questioningly
at
peredonov
you
have
noticed
continued
peredonov
that
there
a
possibility
of
a
scandal
in
our
no
one
has
noticed
it
i
alone
have
detected
it
what
scandal
asked
khripatch
with
a
dry
smile
pacing
up
and
down
his
study
you
arouse
my
curiosity
though
to
speak
candidly
i
hardly
believe
in
the
possibility
of
a
scandal
in
our
school
yes
but
you
do
know
who
you
have
recently
admitted
to
the
school
said
peredonov
with
such
malevolence
that
khripatch
paused
and
looked
attentively
at
him
i
know
all
the
new
students
perfectly
well
he
said
dryly
besides
it
goes
without
saying
that
the
new
boys
in
the
first
form
have
never
been
excluded
from
another
school
and
the
only
one
who
has
just
entered
the
fifth
form
came
to
us
with
such
recommendations
that
preclude
all
possibility
of
suspicion
yes
but
he
should
have
come
to
us
but
to
some
other
kind
of
institution
said
peredonov
morosely
and
as
if
reluctantly
please
explain
ardalyon
borisitch
said
khripatch
i
hope
you
mean
to
say
that
pilnikov
ought
to
have
been
sent
to
a
reformatory
no
that
creature
should
be
sent
to
a
pension
where
they
do
learn
ancient
languages
said
peredonov
maliciously
and
his
eyes
gleamed
with
spite
khripatch
put
his
hands
into
the
pockets
of
his
short
jacket
and
looked
at
peredonov
with
unusual
astonishment
what
pension
he
asked
do
you
know
what
institutions
are
designated
in
that
way
and
if
you
do
know
how
could
you
venture
to
make
such
an
unseemly
suggestion
khripatch
flushed
violently
and
his
voice
sounded
drier
and
even
more
decisive
at
another
time
these
symptoms
of
the
anger
would
have
flustered
peredonov
but
this
time
he
was
not
flustered
of
course
you
think
pilnikov
a
boy
he
said
screwing
up
his
eyes
in
derision
but
he
not
a
boy
at
all
but
a
girl
and
what
sort
of
a
girl
khripatch
uttered
a
dry
abrupt
laugh
but
his
laughter
sounded
affected
it
was
so
loud
and
mechanical
he
always
laughed
like
that
ha
ha
ha
he
laughed
mechanically
and
when
he
had
finished
laughing
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
threw
his
head
back
as
if
he
had
dropped
exhausted
from
laughing
you
astonish
me
my
good
ardalyon
borisitch
ha
ha
ha
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
upon
what
you
base
your
supposition
if
the
premises
which
have
led
you
to
this
conclusion
are
not
secret
ha
ha
ha
peredonov
recounted
everything
that
he
had
heard
from
varvara
and
incidentally
he
dilated
on
the
poor
qualities
of
kokovkina
khripatch
listened
and
now
and
then
gave
vent
to
his
dry
mechanical
laughter
i
afraid
my
dear
ardalyon
borisitch
that
your
imagination
has
played
pranks
with
you
he
said
as
he
rose
and
caught
peredonov
by
the
sleeve
i
as
well
as
many
of
my
esteemed
friends
have
children
we
not
in
our
swaddling
clothes
surely
you
do
think
that
we
would
have
admitted
a
disguised
girl
as
a
boy
that
your
opinion
said
peredonov
but
if
anything
should
happen
who
going
to
be
responsible
ha
ha
ha
laughed
khripatch
what
consequences
are
you
afraid
of
it
demoralise
the
school
said
peredonov
khripatch
frowned
and
said
you
presuming
too
far
all
that
you
have
told
me
so
far
give
me
the
slightest
cause
for
sharing
in
your
suspicion
that
same
evening
peredonov
rapidly
went
round
to
all
his
colleagues
from
the
inspector
down
to
the
and
told
everyone
that
pilnikov
was
a
girl
in
disguise
they
all
laughed
and
refused
to
believe
him
but
when
he
left
several
of
them
began
to
wonder
if
it
were
not
true
the
masters
wives
believed
it
immediately
next
morning
many
came
to
their
classes
with
the
thought
that
peredonov
was
possibly
right
they
did
not
speak
of
this
openly
yet
they
no
longer
argued
with
peredonov
and
limited
themselves
to
indecisive
and
ambiguous
answers
each
was
afraid
that
he
would
be
considered
stupid
if
he
argued
about
the
matter
should
it
afterwards
prove
to
be
true
many
would
have
liked
to
know
what
the
thought
of
it
but
the
stopped
in
his
own
house
more
than
usual
he
came
very
late
to
the
one
lesson
he
gave
that
day
to
the
sixth
form
remained
there
hardly
more
than
five
minutes
and
then
went
to
his
study
without
speaking
to
anyone
at
last
before
the
fourth
lesson
the
divinity
master
and
two
other
instructors
went
to
the
study
on
the
pretext
of
business
and
the
divinity
master
cautiously
led
up
to
the
subject
of
pilnikov
but
the
laughed
so
confidently
and
so
indifferently
that
all
three
became
convinced
that
the
whole
thing
was
an
invention
the
quickly
went
on
to
other
subjects
told
a
new
piece
of
town
news
complained
about
his
bad
headache
and
said
that
he
would
probably
have
to
call
in
the
doctor
evgeny
ivanovitch
then
he
told
them
in
a
very
voice
that
his
lesson
that
day
had
only
made
his
headache
worse
for
as
it
happened
peredonov
was
in
the
next
class
and
the
students
had
for
some
reason
or
other
laughed
frequently
and
with
extraordinary
loudness
khripatch
laughed
dryly
and
said
this
year
fate
has
not
been
kind
to
me
three
times
a
week
i
am
compelled
to
sit
in
a
next
to
ardalyon
borisitch
and
just
imagine
there
is
constant
boisterous
laughter
one
would
think
that
ardalyon
borisitch
was
not
at
all
an
amusing
man
and
yet
he
always
arouses
merriment
and
without
giving
them
time
to
comment
on
this
khripatch
changed
the
subject
it
was
true
that
recently
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
laughter
at
peredonov
classes
though
they
did
not
particularly
please
him
on
the
contrary
children
laughter
annoyed
peredonov
but
he
could
not
restrain
himself
from
saying
things
which
were
malapropos
and
unnecessary
now
he
would
tell
a
stupid
anecdote
now
he
would
try
to
subdue
one
of
the
most
quiet
boys
by
sneering
at
him
in
his
classes
there
were
also
a
number
of
boys
who
were
glad
of
every
opportunity
to
create
disorder
and
at
every
one
of
peredonov
sallies
they
would
roar
with
laughter
after
school
khripatch
sent
for
the
physician
picked
up
his
hat
and
went
into
his
garden
which
was
situated
between
the
school
and
the
the
garden
was
large
and
shady
the
little
boys
loved
it
they
were
allowed
to
run
about
in
it
freely
during
recreation
but
this
was
the
reason
why
the
assistant
masters
did
not
like
it
they
were
afraid
that
something
would
happen
to
the
boys
but
khripatch
insisted
that
the
boys
should
spend
their
recreation
time
in
the
garden
this
was
necessary
in
order
to
make
his
reports
appear
more
imposing
as
he
walked
through
the
corridor
he
stopped
outside
the
gymnasium
hall
for
a
while
and
then
walked
in
with
bent
head
from
his
cheerless
face
and
slow
walk
everyone
knew
that
he
had
a
headache
the
fifth
form
was
getting
ready
for
its
exercises
they
stood
in
a
row
and
the
athletic
instructor
a
lieutenant
of
the
local
reserve
battalion
was
about
to
give
a
command
but
on
seeing
the
he
went
forward
to
meet
him
khripatch
shook
his
hand
and
looking
somewhat
confusedly
at
the
students
asked
are
you
satisfied
with
them
do
they
work
well
do
any
of
them
get
tired
the
lieutenant
deep
in
his
heart
detested
those
students
who
in
his
opinion
had
not
and
could
never
have
a
military
bearing
if
they
had
been
cadets
he
would
have
told
them
at
once
what
he
thought
of
them
but
it
was
not
worth
while
to
tell
the
unpleasant
truth
about
these
sluggards
to
the
man
on
whom
these
lessons
depended
and
so
with
a
smile
on
his
thin
lips
he
looked
at
the
in
a
friendly
way
and
said
oh
yes
they
fine
boys
the
walked
past
some
of
the
boys
in
the
line
and
was
about
to
leave
when
he
stopped
short
as
if
he
had
suddenly
remembered
something
and
are
you
satisfied
with
the
new
boy
is
he
doing
well
does
he
tire
quickly
he
asked
languidly
and
cheerlessly
putting
his
hand
to
his
forehead
the
lieutenant
said
for
the
sake
of
variety
the
boy
in
any
case
was
a
stranger
he
a
little
frail
he
gets
tired
quickly
but
the
seemed
not
to
listen
to
him
and
he
left
the
hall
the
outdoor
air
rather
refreshed
khripatch
he
returned
in
half
an
hour
and
again
standing
in
the
door
looked
on
at
the
exercises
the
boys
were
using
various
gymnastic
appliances
two
or
three
idle
students
who
did
not
notice
the
were
leaning
against
the
wall
taking
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
lieutenant
was
not
looking
at
them
khripatch
walked
up
to
them
but
pilnikov
he
said
why
are
you
leaning
against
the
wall
sasha
flushed
violently
straightened
himself
and
said
nothing
if
you
get
tired
so
quickly
then
perhaps
the
exercises
are
injurious
to
you
said
khripatch
sternly
it
my
fault
i
not
tired
said
sasha
timidly
you
must
choose
between
two
things
said
khripatch
either
not
to
attend
the
gymnastic
exercises
or
in
any
case
come
in
and
see
me
after
the
exercises
he
went
away
hurriedly
and
left
sasha
standing
confused
and
frightened
you
in
for
it
said
the
other
boys
to
him
he
lecture
you
till
evening
khripatch
loved
to
deliver
lengthy
reprimands
and
the
students
dreaded
his
invitations
above
everything
after
the
exercises
sasha
timidly
went
to
the
khripatch
received
him
promptly
he
went
close
to
sasha
looked
intently
into
his
eyes
and
asked
tell
me
pilnikov
do
the
gymnastic
exercises
really
tire
you
you
look
quite
a
healthy
youngster
but
are
deceptive
are
you
sure
you
have
some
illness
perhaps
it
injurious
for
you
to
do
these
exercises
no
nikolai
vlasyevitch
i
quite
well
answered
sasha
red
with
confusion
however
said
khripatch
aleksey
alekseyevitch
was
complaining
about
your
languidness
and
that
you
get
tired
soon
and
i
myself
noticed
that
you
had
a
tired
look
or
perhaps
i
was
mistaken
sasha
did
not
know
how
to
shield
his
eyes
from
khripatch
penetrating
look
he
muttered
in
a
confused
way
i
very
sorry
i
wo
do
it
again
i
was
just
a
little
lazy
really
i
quite
well
i
will
work
hard
at
the
exercises
suddenly
quite
unexpectedly
to
himself
he
burst
into
tears
you
see
said
khripatch
it
obvious
that
you
tired
you
cry
as
if
i
had
given
you
a
severe
scolding
now
quiet
yourself
he
laid
his
hand
on
sasha
shoulder
and
said
i
called
you
in
not
to
lecture
you
but
to
make
things
clear
sit
down
pilnikov
i
can
see
you
tired
sasha
quickly
dried
his
wet
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
and
said
i
not
a
bit
tired
sit
down
sit
down
said
khripatch
not
unkindly
and
pushed
a
chair
over
to
sasha
really
i
not
tired
nikolai
vlasyevitch
sasha
assured
him
khripatch
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
made
him
sit
down
sat
down
himself
opposite
the
boy
and
said
let
talk
the
matter
over
quietly
pilnikov
you
yourself
can
not
tell
the
actual
condition
of
your
health
you
very
good
and
conscientious
in
all
respects
that
is
why
i
can
understand
your
wanting
to
be
relieved
from
the
gymnastic
exercises
by
the
way
i
asked
evgeny
ivanovitch
to
come
here
as
i
do
feel
quite
myself
he
might
incidentally
look
at
you
i
hope
you
have
nothing
against
that
khripatch
looked
at
his
watch
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
began
to
talk
with
sasha
as
to
how
he
had
spent
the
summer
evgeny
ivanovitch
sourovtsev
the
school
physician
a
little
dark
alert
man
soon
appeared
he
delighted
in
conversations
on
politics
and
news
generally
his
knowledge
was
not
great
but
he
attended
his
patients
conscientiously
and
as
he
preferred
diet
and
hygiene
to
medicines
he
was
generally
successful
in
his
cases
sasha
was
asked
to
undress
sourovtsev
examined
him
attentively
but
found
nothing
wrong
with
him
as
for
khripatch
he
was
now
convinced
that
sasha
was
not
a
girl
though
he
was
convinced
of
this
even
before
still
he
considered
it
proper
that
in
the
event
of
any
possible
inquiries
from
the
district
the
school
physician
could
certify
to
the
facts
without
further
investigation
as
khripatch
let
sasha
go
he
said
to
him
kindly
now
we
know
that
you
well
and
i
will
tell
aleksey
alekseyevitch
that
he
not
to
let
you
off
peredonov
had
no
doubt
that
the
discovery
of
a
girl
among
the
students
would
turn
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
himself
and
that
aside
from
promotion
he
would
be
given
a
decoration
this
encouraged
him
to
look
vigilantly
after
the
conduct
of
the
students
as
the
weather
for
some
days
now
had
been
bleak
and
cold
there
were
few
people
in
the
so
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
walk
about
town
and
visit
students
lodgings
and
even
those
students
who
lived
with
their
parents
peredonov
chose
the
parents
who
were
simple
folk
he
would
come
he
would
complain
about
the
boy
the
boy
would
be
whipped
and
peredonov
would
be
satisfied
in
this
way
he
first
of
all
complained
to
yosif
kramarenko
father
who
kept
a
brewery
in
the
town
he
told
him
that
yosif
misbehaved
in
church
the
father
believed
him
and
punished
his
son
the
same
fate
befell
several
others
peredonov
did
not
go
to
those
who
he
thought
would
defend
their
sons
they
might
complain
to
the
authorities
every
day
he
visited
at
least
one
student
lodgings
he
conducted
himself
then
like
an
official
he
reprimanded
gave
orders
and
threatened
still
the
students
felt
themselves
more
independent
in
their
own
lodgings
than
at
school
and
at
times
they
were
rebellious
aside
from
this
there
was
flavitskaya
a
tall
energetic
woman
who
acting
on
peredonov
suggestion
beat
severely
her
young
lodger
vladimir
boultyakov
on
the
following
day
peredonov
would
relate
his
exploits
to
his
class
he
did
not
name
his
victims
but
they
usually
gave
themselves
away
by
their
embarrassment
this
expression
implies
a
house
of
chapter
xiv
rumours
that
pilnikov
was
a
disguised
girl
soon
spread
about
the
town
among
the
first
to
hear
of
it
were
the
routilovs
the
inquisitive
liudmilla
always
tried
to
see
everything
new
with
her
own
eyes
she
had
a
burning
curiosity
about
pilnikov
of
course
she
would
have
to
see
the
masquerading
trickster
she
knew
kokovkina
and
so
one
evening
liudmilla
announced
to
her
sisters
i
going
to
take
a
look
at
this
girl
busybody
said
darya
indignantly
she
got
on
her
best
clothes
said
valeria
with
a
restrained
smile
they
were
annoyed
because
they
had
not
thought
of
it
first
and
it
would
be
awkward
for
the
three
of
them
to
go
liudmilla
was
dressed
more
elaborately
than
usual
she
herself
could
not
tell
why
apart
from
other
considerations
she
liked
to
dress
up
she
dressed
more
lightly
than
her
sisters
her
arms
and
her
shoulders
were
a
little
more
bared
her
dress
a
little
shorter
her
shoes
a
little
lighter
her
stockings
a
little
thinner
more
transparent
and
of
a
flesh
colour
at
home
she
liked
to
go
about
in
a
petticoat
without
stockings
but
with
shoes
on
her
bared
feet
moreover
her
petticoat
and
her
chemise
were
very
charmingly
embroidered
the
weather
was
cold
windy
and
the
fallen
leaves
floated
on
the
speckled
pools
liudmilla
walked
quickly
and
under
her
thin
cloak
she
almost
did
not
feel
the
cold
kokovkina
and
sasha
were
drinking
tea
liudmilla
looked
at
them
with
searching
eyes
they
were
sitting
quietly
drinking
tea
eating
rolls
and
chatting
liudmilla
kissed
kokovkina
and
said
i
come
on
business
dear
olga
vassilyevna
but
that
can
wait
first
warm
me
up
with
a
little
tea
but
who
is
this
young
man
here
sasha
flushed
and
bowed
uneasily
kokovkina
introduced
them
liudmilla
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
to
gossip
in
an
animated
way
the
townspeople
liked
to
see
her
because
she
could
recount
things
prettily
kokovkina
who
was
a
was
openly
glad
to
see
her
and
welcomed
her
heartily
liudmilla
chattered
on
merrily
laughed
and
jumped
up
now
and
then
to
mimic
someone
and
incidently
to
tease
sasha
she
said
to
kokovkina
you
must
feel
lonely
my
dear
from
sitting
always
at
home
with
this
grumpy
little
schoolboy
you
might
look
in
on
us
now
and
then
but
how
can
i
answered
kokovkina
i
too
old
to
go
visiting
do
call
it
visiting
said
liudmilla
just
come
in
when
you
like
and
make
yourself
at
home
this
infant
needs
no
swaddling
sasha
assumed
an
injured
expression
and
blushed
what
a
he
is
said
liudmilla
to
annoy
him
and
nudged
sasha
you
ought
to
talk
to
your
visitors
he
still
only
a
youngster
said
kokovkina
he
very
modest
i
modest
too
said
liudmilla
with
a
smile
sasha
laughed
and
said
ingenuously
really
are
you
modest
liudmilla
burst
out
laughing
her
laughter
as
always
was
delightfully
gay
as
she
laughed
she
flushed
very
much
and
her
eyes
became
mischievous
and
guilty
and
their
glance
attempted
to
dodge
those
of
her
companions
sasha
was
flustered
and
tried
eagerly
to
explain
i
did
mean
that
i
wanted
to
say
that
you
were
very
gay
and
not
modest
and
not
that
you
were
immodest
then
feeling
what
he
had
said
was
not
as
clear
as
it
might
be
he
grew
more
confused
and
blushed
what
impertinence
exclaimed
liudmilla
laughing
and
flushing
what
a
jewel
he
is
you
embarrassed
my
sashenka
said
kokovkina
looking
affectionately
at
both
liudmilla
and
sasha
liudmilla
leaning
forward
with
a
movement
stroked
head
he
gave
a
loud
embarrassed
laugh
turned
from
under
her
hands
and
ran
into
his
room
my
dear
find
me
a
husband
said
liudmilla
without
any
ado
well
you
found
a
nice
matchmaker
i
must
say
said
kokovkina
with
a
smile
but
it
was
evident
from
the
expression
of
her
face
that
she
would
have
undertaken
to
make
a
marriage
with
great
enjoyment
how
are
you
not
a
matchmaker
and
why
should
i
make
a
bride
said
liudmilla
surely
you
would
be
ashamed
to
make
a
marriage
for
me
liudmilla
put
her
arms
on
her
hips
and
danced
a
few
steps
in
front
of
her
hostess
well
said
kokovkina
what
a
wood
flower
you
are
you
might
do
it
in
your
spare
time
said
liudmilla
with
a
laugh
what
sort
of
husband
would
you
like
asked
kokovkina
with
amusement
let
him
be
let
him
be
dark
my
dear
he
must
certainly
be
dark
very
dark
dark
as
a
well
you
have
a
model
here
your
student
his
eyebrows
must
be
black
and
his
eyes
languishing
and
his
eyelashes
must
be
long
long
eyelashes
your
schoolboy
certainly
handsome
really
handsome
i
like
one
of
his
sort
soon
liudmilla
made
ready
to
leave
it
had
grown
quite
dark
sasha
went
out
to
escort
her
only
as
far
as
the
cabby
said
liudmilla
in
a
gentle
voice
and
looked
at
sasha
with
her
caressing
eyes
blushing
guiltily
once
on
the
street
liudmilla
became
gay
once
more
and
began
to
sasha
well
are
you
always
at
your
lessons
do
you
read
much
yes
i
love
reading
replied
sasha
andersen
no
not
but
all
sorts
of
books
i
like
history
and
poems
too
do
you
like
poetry
and
who
your
favourite
poet
asked
liudmilla
gravely
nadson
of
course
replied
sasha
with
the
deep
conviction
of
the
impossibility
of
any
other
answer
so
so
said
liudmilla
encouragingly
i
like
nadson
too
but
only
in
the
morning
in
the
evening
my
dear
i
like
to
dress
up
and
what
do
you
like
to
do
sasha
looked
at
her
with
his
soft
dark
eyes
they
suddenly
became
moist
and
he
said
quietly
i
like
to
caress
well
you
are
a
nice
boy
said
liudmilla
putting
her
arm
on
his
shoulder
so
you
like
to
caress
but
do
you
like
to
splash
in
your
bath
sasha
smiled
liudmilla
went
on
in
warm
water
yes
in
warm
and
in
cold
said
the
boy
shamefacedly
and
what
sort
of
soap
do
you
like
glycerine
and
do
you
like
grapes
sasha
began
to
laugh
you
a
queer
girl
it
a
different
thing
and
you
ask
as
if
it
were
the
same
you
ca
take
me
in
as
if
i
wanted
to
said
liudmilla
laughing
i
know
what
you
are
you
a
giggler
where
did
you
get
that
everyone
says
so
said
sasha
you
a
little
gossip
said
liudmilla
with
assumed
severity
sasha
blushed
again
well
here
a
cabby
cabby
shouted
liudmilla
cabby
shouted
sasha
also
the
cabman
came
up
in
his
shaky
drozhky
liudmilla
told
him
where
to
go
he
thought
a
while
and
demanded
forty
kopecks
liudmilla
said
do
you
think
it
far
that
shows
that
you
do
know
the
road
well
how
much
will
you
give
asked
the
cabman
you
can
take
which
half
you
like
sasha
laughed
you
a
cheerful
young
lady
said
the
cabby
with
a
grin
you
might
add
another
piece
thank
you
for
escorting
me
my
dear
said
liudmilla
as
she
pressed
sasha
hand
tightly
and
seated
herself
in
the
drozhky
sasha
ran
back
to
the
house
thinking
cheerfully
about
the
cheerful
maiden
liudmilla
returned
home
in
a
cheerful
mood
smiling
and
thinking
of
something
pleasant
the
sisters
awaited
her
they
sat
at
a
round
table
in
the
lit
up
by
a
hanging
lamp
the
brown
bottle
of
on
the
white
tablecloth
looked
very
cheerful
the
silver
paper
round
the
bottle
neck
glittered
brightly
it
was
surrounded
by
plates
containing
apples
nuts
and
sweets
made
of
honey
and
nuts
darya
was
slightly
tipsy
her
face
was
red
and
her
clothes
were
a
little
dishevelled
she
was
singing
loudly
liudmilla
as
she
came
heard
the
last
couplet
but
one
of
the
song
her
dress
is
gone
her
reed
is
gone
naked
he
leads
her
naked
along
the
dune
fear
drives
out
shame
shame
drives
out
fear
the
shepherdess
is
all
in
tears
what
you
have
seen
larissa
was
also
present
she
was
sprucely
dressed
she
was
tranquilly
cheerful
and
eating
an
apple
cutting
off
the
slices
with
a
small
knife
and
was
laughing
well
she
asked
what
did
you
see
darya
stopped
singing
and
looked
at
liudmilla
valeria
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
with
the
little
finger
against
her
temple
and
smiled
responsively
at
larissa
she
was
slender
fragile
and
her
smile
was
unreposeful
liudmilla
poured
herself
a
liqueur
and
said
it
all
nonsense
he
a
real
boy
and
quite
sympathetic
he
very
dark
and
his
eyes
sparkle
but
he
quite
young
and
innocent
then
she
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
the
sisters
when
they
looked
at
her
began
to
laugh
also
well
what
one
to
say
it
all
peredonovian
nonsense
said
darya
and
waved
her
hand
contemptuously
she
grew
thoughtful
for
a
moment
leaning
her
head
on
her
hands
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
i
might
as
well
go
on
singing
she
said
and
began
to
sing
with
piercing
loudness
there
was
an
intensely
grim
animation
in
her
squeals
if
a
dead
man
should
be
released
from
the
grave
on
condition
of
his
singing
perpetually
he
would
sing
in
this
way
but
the
sisters
had
already
become
used
to
darya
tipsy
bawling
and
at
times
even
joined
in
with
her
in
purposely
ranting
voices
well
she
let
herself
loose
said
liudmilla
laughing
it
was
not
that
she
objected
to
the
noise
but
she
wanted
her
sisters
to
listen
to
her
darya
shouted
angrily
interrupting
her
song
in
the
middle
of
a
word
what
the
matter
with
you
i
not
interfering
with
you
and
immediately
she
took
up
the
song
at
the
very
place
she
had
left
off
larissa
said
amiably
let
her
sing
it
raining
hard
on
me
there
no
roof
for
a
girl
like
me
bawled
darya
imitating
the
sounds
and
drawing
out
the
syllables
as
the
simple
do
to
make
a
song
more
pathetic
for
example
it
sounded
like
this
it
on
particularly
unpleasant
were
the
sounds
stretched
out
where
the
accents
did
not
fall
it
produced
a
superlative
impression
it
would
have
brought
a
mortal
depression
on
a
new
listener
a
sadness
resounding
through
our
native
fields
and
villages
a
sadness
consuming
with
a
hideous
flame
the
living
word
debasing
a
once
living
song
with
senseless
howling
suddenly
darya
sprang
up
put
her
hand
on
her
hips
and
began
to
shout
out
a
gay
song
dancing
and
snapping
her
fingers
go
away
young
fellow
go
away
i
am
a
robber
daughter
a
fig
for
your
good
looks
i
stick
a
knife
in
your
belly
i
not
have
a
muzhik
i
going
to
love
a
bossiak
darya
danced
and
sang
and
her
eyes
seemed
as
motionless
as
the
dead
moon
in
its
orbit
liudmilla
laughed
loudly
and
her
heart
now
felt
faint
now
felt
oppressed
from
gay
joyousness
or
from
the
cherry
brandy
valeria
laughed
quietly
with
laughter
and
looked
enviously
at
her
sisters
she
wished
she
were
as
cheerful
as
they
but
somehow
she
felt
anything
but
cheerful
she
thought
that
she
was
the
last
the
youngest
the
hence
her
frailty
and
her
unhappiness
and
though
she
was
laughing
she
was
almost
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
larissa
looked
at
her
and
winked
and
valeria
suddenly
grew
more
cheerful
larissa
rose
and
moved
her
shoulders
presently
in
a
single
instant
all
four
sisters
were
whirling
round
madly
as
in
a
mystic
dance
and
following
darya
lead
were
shouting
new
one
more
gay
and
absurd
than
the
other
the
sisters
were
young
handsome
and
their
voices
sounded
loud
and
wild
the
witches
on
the
bald
hill
might
have
envied
this
mad
whirl
all
night
liudmilla
dreamt
such
sultry
african
dreams
now
she
dreamt
that
she
was
lying
in
a
smotheringly
hot
room
and
her
bedcover
slipping
from
her
left
her
hot
body
naked
and
then
a
scaly
ringed
serpent
crept
into
the
room
and
climbing
up
a
tree
coiled
itself
round
the
branches
of
its
naked
handsome
limbs
then
she
dreamt
of
a
hot
summer
evening
by
a
lake
under
threatening
clouds
she
was
lying
on
its
bank
naked
with
a
smooth
golden
crown
across
her
forehead
there
was
a
smell
of
tepid
stagnant
water
and
of
grass
withered
by
the
heat
and
upon
the
dark
ominous
calm
water
floated
a
white
powerful
swan
of
regal
stateliness
he
beat
the
water
noisily
with
his
wings
and
hissing
loudly
approached
her
and
embraced
her
and
it
felt
delicious
and
languorous
and
sad
and
both
the
serpent
and
the
swan
in
bending
over
her
showed
face
almost
bluely
pale
with
dark
enigmatically
sad
eyes
their
eyelids
jealously
covering
their
witching
glance
descended
heavily
and
apprehensively
then
liudmilla
dreamt
of
a
magnificent
chamber
with
low
heavy
arches
it
was
crowded
with
strong
naked
beautiful
boys
the
handsomest
of
all
was
sasha
she
was
sitting
high
and
the
naked
boys
in
turn
beat
one
another
and
when
sasha
was
laid
on
the
floor
his
face
towards
liudmilla
and
beaten
he
loudly
laughed
and
wept
she
was
also
laughing
as
one
laughs
only
in
dreams
when
the
heart
begins
to
beat
intensely
and
when
one
laughs
long
unrestrainedly
the
laughter
of
oblivion
and
of
death
in
the
morning
after
all
these
dreams
liudmilla
felt
that
she
was
passionately
in
love
with
sasha
an
impatient
desire
to
see
him
seized
hold
of
her
but
the
thought
that
she
would
see
him
dressed
made
her
sad
how
stupid
that
small
boys
do
go
about
naked
or
at
least
barefoot
like
the
streets
gamins
in
summer
upon
whom
liudmilla
loved
to
gaze
because
they
walked
about
barefoot
and
sometimes
showed
their
bared
legs
quite
high
as
if
it
were
so
shameful
to
have
a
body
thought
liudmilla
that
even
small
boys
hide
it

chapter
xv
volodin
went
punctually
to
the
adamenkos
to
give
his
lessons
his
hopes
that
the
young
woman
would
invite
him
to
take
coffee
were
not
realised
each
time
he
came
he
was
taken
straight
to
the
little
shanty
used
for
carpentry
misha
usually
stood
in
his
linen
apron
at
the
bench
having
got
ready
what
was
necessary
for
the
lesson
he
did
obediently
but
unwillingly
all
that
volodin
told
him
to
do
in
order
to
work
less
misha
tried
to
drag
volodin
into
conversation
but
volodin
wished
to
work
conscientiously
and
refused
to
comply
mishenka
he
would
say
you
had
better
do
your
work
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
then
if
you
like
we
can
have
a
talk
then
as
much
as
you
like
but
now
not
a
bit
business
before
everything
misha
sighed
lightly
and
went
on
with
his
work
but
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
he
had
no
desire
to
talk
he
said
he
had
no
time
and
that
he
had
much
home
work
to
do
sometimes
nadezhda
came
to
the
lesson
to
see
how
misha
was
getting
along
misha
noticed
and
made
use
of
the
fact
that
in
her
presence
volodin
could
much
more
easily
be
lured
into
conversation
when
nadezhda
saw
that
misha
was
not
working
she
immediately
said
to
him
misha
do
be
lazy
and
when
she
left
she
said
to
volodin
i
sorry
that
i
interrupted
if
you
give
him
a
little
leeway
he
gets
very
lazy
at
the
beginning
volodin
was
mortified
by
nadezhda
behaviour
then
he
thought
that
she
hesitated
to
ask
him
to
take
coffee
in
case
there
should
be
gossip
then
he
thought
that
she
need
not
have
come
to
look
on
at
the
lessons
at
all
and
yet
she
came
was
it
because
she
liked
to
see
him
so
volodin
reasoned
to
his
advantage
from
the
fact
that
nadezhda
from
the
very
first
had
eagerly
agreed
that
he
should
give
lessons
and
had
not
stopped
to
bargain
he
was
encouraged
in
these
suppositions
by
peredonov
and
varvara
it
is
clear
that
she
in
love
with
you
said
peredonov
and
what
better
fiancé
could
she
have
added
varvara
volodin
tried
to
look
modest
and
felt
pleased
with
his
prospects
once
peredonov
said
to
him
you
a
fiancé
and
yet
you
wear
that
shabby
tie
i
not
her
fiancé
yet
ardasha
said
volodin
soberly
nevertheless
trembling
with
pleasure
but
i
can
easily
get
a
new
tie
buy
yourself
one
with
a
pattern
in
it
advised
peredonov
so
that
it
will
be
clear
that
love
is
burning
within
you
better
get
a
red
one
said
varvara
and
the
fancier
the
better
and
a
you
can
buy
a
cheaply
and
with
a
stone
too
it
will
be
quite
peredonov
thought
that
possibly
volodin
had
not
enough
money
or
he
might
think
of
economising
and
buy
a
simple
black
one
and
that
would
be
fatal
thought
peredonov
adamenko
is
a
fashionable
girl
and
if
he
should
come
to
propose
to
her
in
any
kind
of
a
tie
she
might
be
offended
and
reject
him
peredonov
said
only
do
buy
a
cheap
one
pavloushka
you
won
from
me
enough
money
to
pay
for
a
tie
how
much
do
i
owe
you
i
think
it
one
rouble
forty
kopecks
is
it
you
quite
right
about
the
forty
kopecks
said
volodin
with
a
wry
smile
only
it
not
one
rouble
but
two
peredonov
knew
himself
that
it
was
two
roubles
but
it
was
more
pleasant
to
pay
only
one
he
said
you
a
liar
what
two
roubles
varvara
dmitrievna
my
witness
said
volodin
you
better
pay
ardalyon
borisitch
said
varvara
since
you
lost
and
i
remember
that
it
was
two
forty
peredonov
thought
that
as
varvara
was
interceding
for
volodin
that
meant
that
she
was
going
over
to
his
side
he
frowned
produced
the
money
from
his
purse
and
said
all
right
let
it
be
two
forty
it
wo
ruin
me
you
a
poor
man
pavloushka
well
here
it
is
volodin
took
the
money
counted
it
then
assumed
an
offended
expression
and
bent
down
his
thick
forehead
stuck
out
his
lower
lip
and
said
in
a
bleating
cracked
voice
ardalyon
borisitch
you
happen
to
be
in
debt
to
me
and
therefore
you
got
to
pay
and
that
i
happen
to
be
poor
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
i
have
yet
come
down
to
begging
my
bread
off
anyone
and
as
you
know
the
only
poor
devil
is
the
one
that
has
any
bread
to
eat
and
as
i
eat
bread
and
butter
with
it
that
means
i
not
poor
and
he
became
mollified
and
at
the
same
time
blushed
with
joy
to
think
that
he
had
answered
so
cleverly
and
twisted
his
lips
into
a
smile
at
last
peredonov
and
volodin
decided
to
go
and
fix
up
the
match
they
arranged
themselves
very
elaborately
and
they
had
a
solemn
and
more
than
usually
stupid
look
peredonov
put
on
a
white
stock
volodin
a
vivid
red
tie
with
green
stripes
peredonov
argued
thus
as
i
am
to
do
the
mine
is
a
sober
role
i
must
live
up
to
it
so
i
must
wear
a
white
tie
and
you
the
lover
should
show
your
flaming
feelings
with
intense
solemnity
peredonov
and
volodin
seated
themselves
in
the
adamenkos
peredonov
sat
on
a
sofa
and
volodin
in
an
nadezhda
looked
at
her
visitors
in
astonishment
the
visitors
talked
about
the
weather
and
various
bits
of
news
with
the
look
of
people
who
had
come
upon
a
delicate
affair
and
did
not
know
how
to
approach
it
at
last
peredonov
coughed
frowned
and
began
nadezhda
vassilyevna
we
come
on
business
on
business
said
volodin
making
a
significant
face
and
he
protruded
his
lips
it
about
him
said
peredonov
and
pointed
at
volodin
with
his
forefinger
it
about
me
echoed
volodin
and
pointed
his
own
forefinger
at
his
breast
nadezhda
smiled
please
go
on
she
said
i
going
to
speak
for
him
said
peredonov
he
bashful
he
make
up
his
mind
to
do
it
himself
he
a
worthy
good
man
he
does
not
earn
much
but
that
nothing
everyone
needs
a
different
thing
one
needs
money
another
needs
a
man
well
why
you
say
something
he
turned
to
volodin
say
something
volodin
lowered
his
head
and
spoke
in
a
trembling
voice
like
a
bleating
ram
it
true
i
do
earn
high
wages
but
i
shall
always
have
my
crumb
of
bread
it
true
that
i
did
go
to
a
university
but
i
live
as
may
god
grant
everyone
to
do
but
i
do
know
anything
against
myself
and
besides
let
everyone
judge
for
himself
but
i
well
i
satisfied
with
myself
he
spread
out
his
arms
lowered
his
forehead
as
if
he
were
about
to
butt
and
grew
silent
and
so
as
you
see
said
peredonov
he
a
young
man
and
he
should
live
like
this
he
ought
to
marry
in
any
case
the
married
man
is
always
better
off
and
if
his
wife
suits
him
what
can
be
better
added
volodin
and
you
continued
peredonov
are
a
girl
you
also
ought
to
marry
from
behind
the
door
there
came
a
slight
rustle
abrupt
smothered
sounds
as
though
someone
were
breathing
or
laughing
with
a
closed
mouth
nadezhda
looked
sternly
in
the
direction
of
the
door
and
said
coldly
you
are
too
concerned
about
me
with
an
annoying
emphasis
on
the
word
too
you
do
want
a
rich
husband
said
peredonov
you
rich
yourself
you
need
someone
to
love
you
and
gratify
you
in
everything
and
you
know
him
you
could
understand
him
he
not
indifferent
to
you
and
perhaps
you
not
indifferent
to
him
either
so
you
see
i
have
the
merchant
and
you
have
the
goods
that
is
you
are
the
goods
yourself
nadezhda
blushed
and
bit
her
lip
to
keep
from
laughing
the
same
sounds
continued
behind
the
door
volodin
bashfully
lowered
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
affair
was
going
well
what
goods
asked
nadezhda
cautiously
pardon
me
i
understand
what
do
you
mean
do
understand
asked
peredonov
incredulously
well
i
tell
you
straight
pavel
vassilyevitch
has
come
to
ask
for
your
hand
and
heart
i
ask
on
his
behalf
behind
the
door
something
fell
to
the
floor
and
rolled
and
snorted
and
panted
nadezhda
growing
red
with
suppressed
laughter
looked
at
her
visitors
volodin
proposal
seemed
to
her
a
ridiculous
impertinence
yes
said
volodin
nadezhda
vassilyevna
i
come
to
ask
for
your
hand
and
heart
he
grew
red
and
rose
from
his
chair
his
foot
awkwardly
rumpled
the
carpet
bowed
and
quickly
sat
down
again
then
he
got
up
again
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
said
as
he
looked
tenderly
at
the
girl
nadezhda
vassilyevna
permit
me
to
say
a
few
words
as
i
have
loved
you
for
some
time
you
surely
will
not
say
to
me
he
threw
himself
forward
and
let
himself
down
on
one
knee
before
nadezhda
and
kissed
her
hand
nadezhda
vassilyevna
believe
me
i
swear
to
you
he
exclaimed
and
lifted
his
hand
high
in
the
air
and
with
a
wild
swing
hit
himself
full
on
the
chest
so
that
the
sound
through
the
room
what
the
matter
with
you
please
get
up
said
nadezhda
in
embarrassment
why
are
you
doing
this
volodin
rose
and
with
an
injured
expression
on
his
face
returned
to
his
seat
there
he
pressed
both
his
hands
on
his
chest
and
again
exclaimed
nadezhda
vassilyevna
do
believe
me
until
death
from
all
my
soul
i
sorry
said
nadezhda
but
i
really
ca
i
must
bring
up
my
brother
even
now
he
crying
behind
the
door
bring
up
your
brother
said
volodin
protruding
an
offended
lip
i
fail
to
see
why
that
should
prevent
it
no
in
any
case
it
concerns
him
said
nadezhda
rising
hurriedly
he
must
be
asked
just
wait
she
quickly
ran
from
the
rustling
with
her
bright
yellow
dress
caught
misha
by
the
shoulder
behind
the
door
and
ran
with
him
to
his
room
as
she
stood
there
by
the
door
panting
with
running
and
suppressed
laughter
she
said
in
a
breathless
voice
it
quite
useless
to
ask
you
not
to
listen
behind
doors
must
i
really
be
very
stern
with
you
misha
catching
her
by
the
waist
with
his
head
against
her
laughed
and
shook
with
his
efforts
to
suppress
his
laughter
she
pushed
misha
into
his
room
sat
down
on
a
chair
near
the
door
and
began
to
laugh
did
you
hear
what
he
thinking
of
your
pavel
vassilyevitch
she
said
come
with
me
into
the
and
do
you
dare
to
laugh
i
will
ask
you
in
their
presence
and
do
you
dare
say
do
you
understand
blurted
out
misha
and
stuck
a
corner
of
his
handkerchief
in
his
mouth
to
stop
his
laughing
but
with
little
success
cover
your
face
with
your
handkerchief
when
you
want
to
laugh
his
sister
advised
him
and
led
him
by
his
shoulder
into
the
there
she
placed
him
in
an
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
at
his
side
volodin
looked
offended
and
lowered
his
head
like
a
little
ram
you
see
she
said
pointing
at
her
brother
i
barely
dried
his
tears
poor
boy
i
have
to
be
a
mother
to
him
and
he
has
a
sudden
idea
that
i
going
to
leave
him
misha
covered
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
his
whole
body
shook
in
order
to
hide
his
laughter
he
uttered
a
protracted
moan
nadezhda
embraced
him
pinched
his
hand
secretly
and
said
well
stop
crying
my
dear
stop
crying
misha
for
a
moment
unexpectedly
felt
touched
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
he
lowered
his
handkerchief
and
looked
angrily
at
his
sister
the
youngster
might
suddenly
get
into
a
fit
thought
peredonov
and
begin
to
bite
human
spit
they
say
is
poisonous
he
moved
closer
to
volodin
so
that
in
case
of
danger
he
could
hide
behind
him
nadezhda
said
to
her
brother
pavel
vassilyevitch
asks
for
my
hand
hand
and
heart
corrected
peredonov
and
heart
added
volodin
modestly
but
with
dignity
misha
covered
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
choking
with
suppressed
laughter
said
no
do
marry
him
what
would
become
of
me
volodin
hurt
but
agitated
said
in
a
trembling
voice
i
surprised
nadezhda
vassilyevna
that
you
are
asking
your
brother
who
is
besides
quite
a
child
even
if
he
were
a
young
man
you
might
speak
for
yourself
but
at
your
asking
him
now
nadezhda
vassilyevna
i
am
not
only
surprised
but
shocked
to
ask
little
boys
seems
ridiculous
to
me
said
peredonov
gravely
whom
have
i
to
ask
it
all
the
same
to
my
aunt
and
as
responsible
for
his
upbringing
how
can
i
marry
you
perhaps
you
would
treat
him
harshly
is
it
so
mishka
that
you
afraid
of
his
harshness
no
nadya
said
misha
looking
out
with
one
eye
from
behind
his
handkerchief
i
not
afraid
of
his
harshness
why
should
i
but
i
am
afraid
that
pavel
vassilyevitch
would
spoil
me
and
not
allow
you
to
put
me
in
the
corner
believe
me
nadezhda
vassilyevna
said
volodin
pressing
his
hands
to
his
heart
i
wo
spoil
mishenka
i
always
think
should
a
boy
be
spoiled
he
well
fed
well
dressed
well
shod
as
for
spoiling
no
i
too
can
put
him
into
the
corner
and
not
spoil
him
at
all
i
can
do
even
more
as
you
a
girl
that
is
a
young
lady
a
little
inconvenient
to
you
but
i
could
easily
birch
him
he
not
only
going
to
put
me
into
a
corner
said
misha
whimpering
having
again
covered
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
but
he
even
birch
me
no
that
does
suit
me
no
nadya
do
you
dare
to
marry
him
well
do
you
hear
i
decidedly
ca
said
nadezhda
it
seems
very
strange
to
me
nadezhda
vassilyevna
that
you
acting
in
this
way
said
volodin
i
come
to
you
with
all
my
affections
and
one
might
even
say
with
fiery
feelings
and
you
give
your
brother
as
an
excuse
if
you
now
give
your
brother
as
an
excuse
another
might
give
her
sister
a
third
her
nephew
or
perhaps
some
other
relative
and
so
no
one
would
marry
so
that
the
whole
human
race
would
come
to
an
end
do
worry
about
that
pavel
vassilyevitch
said
nadezhda
the
world
is
not
threatened
yet
by
such
a
possibility
i
do
want
to
marry
without
misha
consent
and
he
as
you
have
heard
is
not
willing
besides
as
it
clear
that
you
have
promised
to
beat
him
straight
away
you
might
also
beat
me
please
nadezhda
vassilyevna
surely
you
do
think
that
i
would
permit
myself
such
a
disgraceful
action
exclaimed
volodin
desperately
nadezhda
smiled
and
i
myself
have
no
desire
to
marry
she
said
perhaps
you
think
of
entering
a
nunnery
asked
volodin
in
an
offended
voice
more
likely
you
join
the
tolstoyan
sect
corrected
peredonov
and
manure
the
fields
why
should
i
go
anywhere
asked
nadezhda
coldly
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
i
perfectly
well
off
here
volodin
rose
also
protruded
his
lips
in
a
hurt
way
and
said
since
mishenka
feels
this
way
towards
me
and
you
are
on
his
side
then
i
suppose
i
better
stop
the
lessons
for
how
can
i
go
to
the
lessons
if
mishenka
behaves
towards
me
in
this
way
why
not
asked
nadezhda
that
quite
another
affair
peredonov
thought
he
ought
to
make
yet
another
effort
to
prevail
upon
the
young
woman
perhaps
she
would
consent
he
said
to
her
gloomily
you
better
think
it
over
well
nadezhda
vassilyevna
why
should
you
do
it
he
a
good
man
he
my
friend
no
said
nadezhda
what
is
there
to
think
about
i
thank
pavel
vassilyevitch
very
much
for
the
honour
but
i
really
ca
peredonov
looked
angrily
at
volodin
and
rose
he
thought
that
volodin
was
a
fool
he
could
make
the
young
woman
fall
in
love
with
him
volodin
stood
beside
his
chair
with
lowered
head
he
asked
reproachfully
so
that
means
it
all
over
nadezhda
vassilyevna
ah
if
so
said
he
waving
his
hand
then
may
god
be
good
to
you
nadezhda
vassilyevna
it
means
that
is
my
miserable
fate
ah
a
youth
loved
a
maiden
and
she
did
not
love
him
god
sees
all
ah
well
i
grieve
and
that
all
you
rejecting
a
good
man
and
you
do
know
what
sort
you
may
get
persisted
peredonov
ah
exclaimed
volodin
once
more
and
turned
to
the
door
but
suddenly
he
decided
to
be
magnanimous
and
returned
to
shake
hands
with
the
young
woman
and
even
with
the
juvenile
offender
misha
in
the
street
peredonov
grumbled
angrily
all
the
way
volodin
complained
bleatingly
in
an
offended
voice
why
did
you
give
up
your
lessons
growled
peredonov
you
must
be
a
rich
man
ardalyon
borisitch
i
only
said
that
if
this
is
so
i
ought
to
give
them
up
and
she
said
to
me
that
i
need
give
them
up
and
as
i
replied
nothing
then
it
follows
that
she
begged
me
to
continue
and
now
it
all
depends
upon
me
if
i
like
i
refuse
if
i
like
continue
them
why
should
you
refuse
said
peredonov
keep
on
going
as
if
nothing
had
happened
let
him
at
least
get
something
out
of
this
he
have
less
cause
for
envy
thought
peredonov
peredonov
felt
terribly
depressed
volodin
was
not
yet
settled
if
i
do
keep
a
on
him
he
may
begin
plotting
with
varvara
besides
it
possible
that
adamenko
will
have
a
grudge
against
me
for
trying
to
marry
her
to
volodin
she
has
relatives
in
peterburg
she
might
write
to
them
and
hurt
my
chances
the
weather
was
unpleasant
the
sky
was
cloudy
the
crows
flew
about
cawing
they
cawed
above
peredonov
head
as
if
they
taunted
him
and
foreboded
new
and
worse
disappointments
peredonov
wrapped
his
scarf
round
his
neck
and
thought
that
in
such
weather
it
was
easy
to
catch
cold
what
sort
of
flowers
are
those
pavloushka
he
asked
as
he
pointed
out
to
volodin
some
small
yellow
flowers
by
a
garden
fence
that
ardasha
said
volodin
sadly
peredonov
recalled
that
many
such
flowers
grew
in
his
own
garden
and
what
a
terrible
name
they
had
perhaps
they
were
poisonous
one
day
varvara
would
take
a
handful
of
them
and
boil
them
instead
of
tea
and
would
poison
him
then
when
the
inspector
certificate
arrived
she
would
poison
him
and
make
volodin
take
his
place
perhaps
they
had
already
agreed
upon
it
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
he
knew
the
name
of
this
flower
in
the
meantime
volodin
was
saying
let
god
be
her
judge
why
did
she
humiliate
me
she
waiting
for
an
aristocrat
and
it
does
occur
to
her
that
there
are
all
sorts
of
aristocrats
she
might
be
miserable
with
one
of
them
but
a
simple
good
man
might
make
her
happy
and
now
i
go
to
church
and
put
a
candle
for
her
health
and
pray
may
god
give
her
a
drunken
husband
who
will
beat
her
who
will
squander
her
money
and
leave
her
penniless
in
the
world
then
she
will
remember
me
but
it
will
be
too
late
she
will
dry
her
tears
with
her
hand
and
say
a
fool
i
was
to
reject
pavel
vassilyevitch
there
no
one
to
direct
me
now
he
was
a
good
man
touched
by
his
own
words
a
few
tears
came
into
volodin
eyes
and
he
wiped
them
from
his
sheepish
bulging
eyes
with
his
hands
you
better
break
some
of
her
windows
one
night
advised
peredonov
well
god
be
with
her
said
volodin
sadly
i
might
be
caught
no
and
what
a
miserable
little
boy
that
is
o
lord
what
have
i
done
to
him
that
he
should
think
of
harming
me
have
i
tried
hard
for
him
and
look
what
mischief
he
done
me
what
do
you
think
of
such
an
infant
what
will
become
of
him
tell
me
yes
said
peredonov
savagely
you
could
even
manage
the
little
boy
oh
you
lover
well
what
of
that
said
volodin
of
course
i
a
lover
i
find
another
she
need
think
that
i
grieve
for
her
oh
you
lover
peredonov
continued
to
taunt
him
and
he
put
a
new
tie
on
how
can
a
chap
like
you
expect
to
be
a
gentleman
lover
well
i
the
lover
and
you
the
ardasha
argued
volodin
you
yourself
aroused
hopes
in
me
and
could
fulfil
them
oh
you
matchmaker
and
they
began
zealously
to
taunt
one
another
and
to
argue
as
if
they
were
discussing
some
important
business
matter
nadezhda
escorted
her
visitors
to
the
door
and
returned
to
the
misha
was
lying
on
the
sofa
laughing
his
sister
pulled
him
off
the
sofa
by
his
shoulders
and
said
but
you
have
forgotten
that
you
ought
to
listen
behind
doors
she
lifted
her
hands
and
made
as
if
to
cross
her
little
fingers
at
an
angle
a
sign
for
him
to
go
into
the
corner
but
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
and
the
little
fingers
did
not
come
together
misha
threw
himself
towards
her
they
embraced
and
laughed
for
a
long
time
all
the
same
she
said
you
ought
to
go
in
the
corner
for
listening
you
ought
to
let
me
off
said
misha
i
saved
you
from
that
bridegroom
so
you
ought
to
be
grateful
who
saved
whom
you
heard
how
they
were
talking
of
giving
you
a
birching
now
go
into
the
corner
well
i
better
kneel
here
said
misha
he
lowered
himself
on
to
his
knees
at
his
sister
feet
and
laid
his
head
in
her
lap
she
caressed
him
and
tickled
him
misha
laughed
scrabbling
with
his
knees
on
the
floor
suddenly
his
sister
pushed
him
from
her
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
misha
remained
alone
he
stayed
awhile
on
his
knees
and
looked
questioningly
at
his
sister
she
seated
herself
more
comfortably
and
picked
up
a
book
as
if
to
read
but
watched
her
brother
over
it
well
i
tired
now
he
said
plaintively
i
not
keeping
you
there
you
put
yourself
there
answered
nadezhda
smiling
over
her
book
well
i
been
punished
let
me
go
please
entreated
misha
did
i
put
you
on
your
knees
said
nadezhda
in
a
voice
of
assumed
indifference
why
do
you
bother
me
i
not
get
up
until
you
forgiven
me
nadezhda
burst
out
laughing
put
the
book
aside
and
taking
hold
of
misha
shoulders
pulled
him
to
her
he
gave
a
squeal
and
threw
himself
into
her
arms
exclaiming
pavloushka
bride
a
sort
of
buttercup
the
word
liuti
means
cruel
ferocious
violent
which
gives
the
point
of
peredonov
reflection
chapter
xvi
the
boy
occupied
all
liudmilla
thoughts
she
often
talked
about
him
with
her
own
family
and
with
acquaintances
sometimes
unseasonably
almost
every
night
she
saw
him
in
a
dream
sometimes
quiet
and
ordinary
but
often
in
a
wild
and
fantastic
guise
her
accounts
of
these
dreams
became
so
habitual
with
her
that
her
sisters
began
to
ask
her
every
morning
how
she
had
dreamed
of
sasha
she
spent
all
her
leisure
thinking
about
him
on
sunday
liudmilla
prevailed
on
her
sisters
to
ask
kokovkina
in
after
mass
and
to
keep
her
a
while
she
wanted
to
find
sasha
alone
she
herself
did
not
go
to
church
she
instructed
her
sisters
tell
her
that
i
overslept
myself
her
sisters
laughed
at
her
plot
but
agreed
to
help
her
they
lived
very
amicably
together
besides
this
suited
them
admirably
liudmilla
would
occupy
herself
with
a
boy
and
that
would
leave
them
the
more
eligible
young
men
and
they
did
as
they
promised
they
invited
kokovkina
to
come
in
after
mass
in
the
meantime
liudmilla
got
ready
to
go
she
dressed
herself
very
gaily
and
handsomely
and
scented
herself
with
soft
syringa
perfume
and
she
put
a
new
bottle
of
scent
and
a
small
sprinkler
into
her
white
and
stood
just
behind
the
blind
in
the
so
that
she
could
see
whether
kokovkina
was
coming
she
had
thought
of
taking
the
scent
before
this
to
scent
the
schoolboy
so
that
he
would
not
smell
of
his
detestable
latin
ink
and
boyishness
liudmilla
loved
perfumes
ordered
them
from
peterburg
and
consumed
a
great
deal
of
them
she
loved
aromatic
flowers
her
room
was
always
full
of
some
sweet
scent
with
flowers
with
perfumes
with
pines
and
in
the
spring
with
but
here
were
the
sisters
and
kokovkina
with
them
liudmilla
ran
through
the
kitchen
across
the
vegetable
garden
by
the
little
gate
along
a
lane
in
order
not
to
meet
kokovkina
she
smiled
happily
walked
quickly
towards
kokovkina
house
and
playfully
swung
her
and
white
parasol
the
warm
autumn
day
gladdened
her
and
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
bringing
with
her
and
spreading
around
her
her
own
spirit
of
gaiety
at
kokovkina
the
maid
told
her
that
her
mistress
was
not
at
home
liudmilla
laughed
noisily
and
joked
with
the
girl
who
opened
the
door
but
perhaps
you
fooling
me
she
said
perhaps
your
mistress
is
hiding
from
me
why
should
she
hide
replied
the
maid
with
a
laugh
but
you
can
come
in
if
you
do
believe
me
liudmilla
looked
into
the
and
shouted
playfully
is
there
a
live
person
in
the
place
ah
a
student
sasha
looked
out
from
his
room
and
was
delighted
to
see
liudmilla
and
seeing
his
joyous
eyes
liudmilla
became
even
gayer
she
asked
and
where
olga
vassilyevna
she
not
at
home
replied
sasha
that
is
she
has
come
back
yet
she
must
have
gone
somewhere
after
church
here
i
back
and
she
not
here
yet
liudmilla
pretended
to
be
astonished
she
swung
her
parasol
and
said
as
if
in
annoyance
how
can
it
be
everyone
else
is
back
from
church
she
always
at
home
and
then
i
come
and
she
out
is
it
because
you
make
such
a
noise
young
man
that
the
old
woman
ca
sit
at
home
sasha
smiled
quietly
he
was
delighted
to
hear
liudmilla
voice
liudmilla
cheerful
laughter
he
was
wondering
at
the
moment
how
he
could
best
offer
to
escort
her
so
that
he
would
be
with
her
even
a
few
more
minutes
to
look
at
her
and
to
listen
to
her
but
liudmilla
did
not
think
of
going
she
looked
at
sasha
with
a
shy
smile
and
said
well
why
do
you
ask
me
to
sit
down
you
polite
young
man
you
see
that
i
tired
let
me
rest
for
a
moment
and
she
entered
the
laughing
and
caressing
sasha
with
her
quick
tender
eyes
sasha
grew
red
with
confusion
but
was
glad
that
she
would
remain
longer
with
him
if
you
like
i
scent
you
said
liudmilla
gaily
would
you
like
it
what
a
person
you
are
said
sasha
you
suddenly
want
to
suffocate
me
why
are
you
so
cruel
liudmilla
burst
out
laughing
and
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
you
stupid
you
do
understand
i
do
mean
to
suffocate
with
the
hands
but
with
scents
sasha
said
ah
scents
i
do
mind
that
liudmilla
took
the
sprinkler
from
her
and
turned
before
sasha
eyes
the
pretty
little
glass
vessel
dark
red
with
gold
ornaments
with
its
rubber
ball
and
bronze
mouthpiece
and
said
do
you
see
i
bought
a
new
sprinkler
and
i
forgot
to
take
it
out
of
my
bag
at
home
then
she
took
out
a
large
with
a
varicoloured
label
guerlain
sasha
said
what
a
deep
you
got
liudmilla
answered
well
you
need
expect
anything
else
i
have
brought
you
any
repeated
sasha
in
amusement
he
looked
on
with
curiosity
as
liudmilla
uncorked
the
he
asked
and
how
will
you
pour
it
out
from
that
without
a
funnel
i
expect
you
to
get
me
a
funnel
said
liudmilla
but
i
have
one
said
sasha
do
as
you
like
but
you
must
get
me
a
funnel
persisted
liudmilla
laughing
i
would
get
one
from
milanya
only
it
used
for
paraffin
said
sasha
liudmilla
again
burst
into
gay
laughter
oh

dull
young
man

me
a
piece
of
paper
if
you
can
spare
it
and
there

funnel

exclaimed
sasha
joyously
it
easy
to
make
one
from
paper

at
once
sasha
ran
into
his
room
shall
i
take
it
from
an
he
shouted
from
his
room
liudmilla
replied
you
can
tear
it
out
from
a
book
a
latin
grammar
if
you
like
i
mind
no
i
better
take
it
from
the
said
sasha
laughingly
he
found
a
clean
tore
out
the
middle
page
and
was
about
to
run
back
to
the
when
he
saw
liudmilla
at
the
door
may
i
come
in
master
of
the
house
she
asked
playfully
please
i
shall
be
very
glad
exclaimed
sasha
liudmilla
seated
herself
at
his
table
and
twisted
a
funnel
from
a
piece
of
paper
with
a
preoccupied
expression
she
began
to
pour
the
scent
from
the
bottle
into
the
sprinkler
the
paper
funnel
at
the
bottom
and
the
side
where
the
trickle
of
scent
ran
became
wet
and
dark
the
aromatic
liquid
accumulated
in
the
funnel
and
dripped
into
the
sprinkler
below
there
was
a
warm
sweet
aroma
of
rose
mixed
with
a
poignant
odour
of
spirit
liudmilla
poured
half
of
the
scent
from
the
bottle
into
the
sprinkler
and
said
that
be
enough
and
she
began
to
screw
the
top
on
the
then
she
rolled
up
the
piece
of
wet
paper
and
rubbed
it
between
the
palms
of
her
hands
smell
she
said
to
sasha
and
put
her
palm
to
his
face
sasha
bent
over
closed
his
eyes
and
inhaled
liudmilla
laughed
lightly
touched
his
lips
with
her
palm
and
held
her
hand
to
his
mouth
sasha
blushed
and
kissed
her
warm
scented
hand
with
a
gentle
contact
of
his
trembling
lips
liudmilla
sighed
a
tender
expression
crossed
her
attractive
face
and
then
changed
to
her
habitual
expression
of
careless
gaiety
she
said
now
just
keep
still
while
i
sprinkle
you
and
she
pressed
the
rubber
bulb
the
aromatic
spurted
out
spreading
into
minute
drops
upon
sasha
blouse
sasha
laughed
as
he
turned
obediently
when
liudmilla
pushed
him
it
smells
nice
eh
she
asked
very
nice
replied
sasha
what
sort
of
scent
is
it
what
a
baby
you
are
said
liudmilla
in
a
teasing
voice
look
on
the
bottle
and
you
see
sasha
looked
at
the
label
and
said
it
smells
of
oil
of
roses
oil
she
said
reproachfully
and
struck
sasha
lightly
on
the
shoulder
sasha
laughed
gave
a
slight
scream
and
thrust
out
his
tongue
curving
it
in
the
shape
of
a
tube
liudmilla
rose
and
began
to
turn
over
sasha
school
books
may
i
look
she
asked
of
course
said
sasha
where
are
your
ones
and
your
noughts
show
me
i
have
yet
had
any
such
thing
said
sasha
with
an
injured
look
no
you
fibbing
asserted
liudmilla
i
sure
you
get
noughts
you
must
have
hidden
them
sasha
smiled
i
sure
you
bored
with
latin
and
greek
said
liudmilla
no
answered
sasha
but
it
was
evident
that
the
mere
conversation
about
would
bring
upon
him
their
habitual
tediousness
it
is
a
little
boring
to
learn
mechanically
he
admitted
but
i
have
a
good
memory
i
only
like
solving
problems
that
i
like
come
to
me
after
lunch
said
liudmilla
thank
you
i
will
said
sasha
blushing
he
felt
very
happy
that
liudmilla
had
invited
him
liudmilla
asked
do
you
know
where
i
live
will
you
come
there
yes
i
know
i
come
there
said
sasha
happily
now
be
sure
to
come
repeated
liudmilla
sternly
i
wait
for
you
do
you
hear
but
suppose
i
should
have
a
lot
of
lessons
asked
sasha
more
from
scruple
than
from
any
idea
that
he
would
not
come
because
of
his
lessons
that
all
nonsense
you
must
come
insisted
liudmilla
they
give
you
a
nought
but
why
asked
sasha
laughingly
because
you
got
to
come
come
for
i
something
to
tell
you
and
something
to
show
you
said
liudmilla
dancing
about
and
humming
a
song
and
lifting
her
skirt
as
she
did
so
and
playfully
sticking
out
her
pink
little
fingers
come
to
me
sweet
one
sober
one
golden
one
she
sang
sasha
began
to
laugh
you
better
tell
me
he
entreated
i
must
and
how
can
i
tell
you
you
wo
come
if
i
do
you
say
there
nothing
to
come
for
very
well
i
come
without
fail
if
they
let
me
of
course
they
let
you
no
one
holding
you
on
a
chain
when
she
said
liudmilla
kissed
sasha
forehead
and
put
her
hand
to
his
lips
he
had
to
kiss
it
and
sasha
was
happy
to
kiss
again
her
white
gentle
hand
and
a
little
shy
and
why
not
but
liudmilla
as
she
left
smiled
archly
and
tenderly
and
she
looked
back
several
times
how
charming
she
is
thought
sasha
he
was
left
alone
how
soon
she
left
he
thought
she
suddenly
went
and
it
hard
to
realise
that
she
gone
she
might
have
stayed
a
little
longer
and
he
felt
ashamed
that
he
had
not
offered
to
escort
her
it
would
have
been
a
bad
idea
to
walk
along
with
her
he
thought
shall
i
run
after
her
has
she
gone
far
i
wonder
perhaps
if
i
run
fast
i
might
overtake
her
but
perhaps
she
would
laugh
he
continued
to
himself
and
besides
she
might
not
like
it
and
so
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
after
her
he
suddenly
felt
depressed
and
uneasy
the
gentle
tremor
from
the
contact
of
her
hand
still
remained
on
his
lips
and
on
his
forehead
her
kiss
still
burned
how
gently
she
kisses
sasha
mused
like
a
sweet
sister
sasha
cheeks
burned
he
felt
deliciously
ashamed
vague
reveries
stirred
within
him
if
she
were
only
my
sister
thought
sasha
tenderly
then
i
might
go
to
her
and
kiss
her
and
say
an
affectionate
word
then
i
might
call
her
dearest
or
i
might
call
her
by
some
special
or
and
she
would
respond
now
that
would
be
a
joy
but
instead
thought
sasha
sadly
she
a
stranger
lovely
but
a
stranger
she
came
and
she
went
and
it
likely
she
not
even
thinking
about
me
and
she
left
behind
her
a
sweet
scent
of
rose
and
lilac
and
the
feeling
of
two
gentle
kisses
and
a
vague
movement
in
the
soul
giving
birth
to
a
sweet
vision
as
the
waves
gave
birth
to
aphrodite
soon
kokovkina
returned
phew
how
strong
it
smells
here
she
said
sasha
blushed
liudmillotchka
was
here
he
said
and
she
did
find
you
at
home
so
she
sat
a
while
and
sprinkled
me
with
scent
and
left
what
tenderness
said
the
old
woman
in
astonishment
and
liudmillotchka
too
sasha
laughed
confusedly
and
ran
into
his
own
room
as
for
kokovkina
she
thought
that
the
routilov
sisters
were
very
gay
and
affectionate
girls
and
that
they
could
captivate
both
the
young
and
the
old
with
their
affectionate
ways
on
the
next
day
from
the
morning
onward
sasha
felt
happy
because
he
had
been
invited
to
the
routilovs
at
home
he
waited
impatiently
for
lunch
after
lunch
blushing
with
embarrassment
he
asked
permission
of
kokovkina
to
go
to
the
routilovs
till
seven
kokovkina
was
astonished
but
let
him
go
sasha
ran
off
gaily
he
had
carefully
combed
his
hair
and
put
pomade
on
it
he
felt
happy
and
slightly
nervous
as
one
is
before
something
important
and
pleasant
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
he
would
come
and
kiss
liudmilla
hand
and
that
she
would
kiss
his
forehead
and
then
when
he
left
the
same
kisses
would
be
exchanged
he
thought
with
delight
of
liudmilla
white
gentle
hand
all
the
three
sisters
met
sasha
in
the
hall
they
liked
to
sit
by
the
window
and
look
out
on
the
street
and
that
was
why
they
saw
him
from
a
distance
gay
chattering
they
surrounded
him
with
a
noisy
impetuous
gaiety
and
he
at
once
felt
at
ease
with
them
and
quite
happy
here
he
is
the
mysterious
young
person
exclaimed
liudmilla
sasha
kissed
her
hand
and
he
did
it
gracefully
and
with
great
pleasure
to
himself
at
the
same
time
he
kissed
darya
hand
and
valeria
it
was
impossible
to
pass
them
by
and
found
this
also
very
agreeable
all
the
more
since
all
three
of
them
kissed
his
cheek
darya
kissed
him
loudly
and
indifferently
as
though
he
were
a
board
valeria
kissed
him
gently
lowering
her
eyes
with
a
sidelong
glance
smiled
slightly
and
barely
brushed
him
with
her
light
lips
touching
his
cheek
with
the
faint
colour
of
an
apple
while
liudmilla
gave
him
a
gay
strong
kiss
he
my
visitor
she
announced
as
she
took
sasha
by
the
shoulders
and
led
him
to
her
room
darya
was
rather
annoyed
at
this
ah
so
he
yours
well
you
can
go
on
kissing
him
she
exclaimed
you
found
a
treasure
as
if
anyone
would
want
to
take
him
away
from
you
valeria
said
nothing
but
only
smiled
it
was
not
interesting
after
all
to
talk
with
a
mere
boy
what
could
he
understand
liudmilla
room
was
spacious
cheerful
and
very
light
because
of
two
large
windows
giving
on
to
the
garden
these
were
curtained
with
light
yellow
tulle
there
was
a
perfume
in
the
room
everything
was
neat
and
bright
the
chairs
and
the
were
covered
with
a
golden
yellow
chintz
marked
with
a
white
almost
indistinguishable
pattern
various
bottles
of
scents
and
scented
waters
and
small
jars
boxes
and
fans
and
several
russian
and
french
books
lay
about
the
room
i
saw
you
in
a
dream
last
night
liudmilla
began
with
a
laugh
you
were
swimming
in
the
river
and
i
was
sitting
on
the
bridge
and
i
caught
you
with
a
and
i
suppose
you
put
me
in
a
little
jar
asked
sasha
jokingly
why
in
a
little
jar
where
then
where
why
i
simply
pulled
you
by
the
ears
and
threw
you
back
in
the
water
and
liudmilla
laughed
for
a
long
time
you
a
strange
girl
said
sasha
but
what
is
it
you
were
going
to
tell
me
but
liudmilla
went
on
laughing
and
did
not
reply
i
see
you
fooled
me
said
he
and
you
also
promised
to
show
me
something
he
said
reproachfully
i
show
you
would
you
like
something
to
eat
asked
liudmilla
i
had
lunch
said
sasha
but
you
are
a
deceiver
as
if
i
needed
to
deceive
you
but
what
a
strong
smell
of
pomade
liudmilla
suddenly
exclaimed
sasha
blushed
i
ca
stand
pomade
said
liudmilla
with
annoyance
you
smeared
up
like
a
young
lady
she
ran
her
hand
down
his
hair
and
struck
his
cheek
with
her
palm
please
do
you
dare
to
use
pomade
she
said
sasha
felt
flustered
very
well
i
wo
do
it
he
said
how
severe
you
are
but
you
scent
yourself
with
perfumes
scents
are
one
thing
but
pomade
is
another
you
stupid
a
fine
comparison
exclaimed
liudmilla
i
never
pomade
myself
why
should
one
glue
one
hair
down
it
different
with
scents
now
let
me
scent
you
would
you
like
it
let
us
say
lilac
would
you
like
it
yes
i
would
like
it
said
sasha
it
was
pleasant
to
think
that
he
would
take
that
scent
home
again
and
astonish
kokovkina
who
would
like
it
asked
liudmilla
taking
the
bottle
and
looking
archly
at
sasha
i
like
it
repeated
sasha
you
like
it
so
you
bark
do
you
she
teased
him
sasha
and
liudmilla
both
laughed
so
you
not
afraid
that
i
suffocate
you
asked
liudmilla
do
you
remember
how
you
were
afraid
yesterday
i
was
afraid
at
all
replied
sasha
hotly
liudmilla
smiling
and
still
teasing
the
boy
began
to
sprinkle
him
with
lilac
scent
sasha
thanked
her
and
once
more
kissed
her
hand
and
please
you
must
get
your
hair
cut
said
liudmilla
sternly
what
the
use
of
wearing
long
locks
you
only
frighten
the
horses
all
right
i
have
my
hair
cut
agreed
sasha
you
terribly
severe
my
hair
is
very
short
not
more
than
half
an
inch
the
inspector
never
grumbled
at
me
for
it
i
like
young
people
with
short
hair
said
liudmilla
impressively
and
threatened
him
with
her
finger
but
i
not
an
inspector
i
got
to
be
obeyed
from
that
time
on
liudmilla
made
it
a
habit
to
go
frequently
to
kokovkina
to
see
sasha
she
tried
especially
at
the
beginning
to
go
when
kokovkina
was
not
at
home
sometimes
she
even
tried
little
tricks
to
lure
the
old
woman
out
of
the
house
darya
once
said
to
her
ah
what
a
coward
you
are
you
afraid
of
an
old
woman
you
better
go
when
she
at
home
and
take
him
out
for
a
walk
liudmilla
followed
this
advice
and
began
to
call
at
odd
times
if
she
found
kokovkina
at
home
she
would
sit
with
her
for
a
while
and
then
take
sasha
out
for
a
walk
in
which
case
she
always
kept
him
for
a
short
time
only
liudmilla
and
sasha
became
friends
with
a
gentle
yet
not
tranquil
friendship
without
noticing
it
herself
liudmilla
had
awakened
in
sasha
premature
though
as
yet
vague
inclinations
and
desires
sasha
often
kissed
liudmilla
hands
and
her
thin
supple
wrists
covered
with
a
soft
elastic
skin
through
her
thin
yellow
sleeve
showed
her
frail
sinuous
blue
veins
and
above
were
her
long
slender
arms
which
could
be
kissed
to
the
very
elbows
when
the
sleeves
were
pushed
back
sasha
sometimes
concealed
from
kokovkina
the
fact
that
liudmilla
had
been
to
the
house
he
did
lie
about
it
but
he
kept
silent
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
lie
as
the
could
easily
have
contradicted
him
and
to
remain
silent
about
liudmilla
visits
was
also
difficult
for
sasha
liudmilla
laughter
echoed
in
his
ears
he
wanted
to
talk
about
her
but
to
talk
about
her
was
somehow
awkward
sasha
quickly
made
friends
with
the
other
sisters
also
he
would
kiss
their
hands
and
soon
even
began
to
call
the
girls
dashenka
liudmillotchka
and
valerotchka
doosheet
means
to
scent
and
also
to
suffocate
there
is
a
pun
here
the
phrase
ti
zhelayesh
means
you
like
you
want
it
when
split
into
three
words
ti
zhe
layesh
it
means
you
do
bark
chapter
xvii
liudmilla
met
sasha
one
day
in
the
street
and
said
to
him
the
wife
is
having
a
birthday
party
for
her
eldest
daughter
is
the
old
lady
going
i
do
know
said
sasha
but
already
the
hope
stirred
within
him
not
so
much
a
hope
as
a
desire
that
kokovkina
would
go
and
liudmilla
come
and
stay
with
him
a
while
in
the
evening
he
reminded
kokovkina
of
the
morrow
party
i
almost
forgotten
it
said
kokovkina
of
course
i
must
go
such
a
charming
girl
and
next
day
as
soon
as
sasha
had
returned
from
school
kokovkina
went
to
the
khripatch
sasha
was
delighted
with
the
idea
that
he
had
helped
to
get
kokovkina
out
of
the
house
that
day
he
felt
certain
that
liudmilla
would
find
time
to
come
so
it
happened
liudmilla
came
she
kissed
sasha
cheek
and
gave
him
her
hand
to
kiss
and
again
she
laughed
and
he
blushed
a
moist
sweet
and
odour
came
from
liudmilla
clothes
rose
and
orris
the
fleshly
and
voluptuous
orris
blooming
among
roses
liudmilla
brought
a
long
narrow
box
wrapped
up
in
thin
paper
through
which
showed
dimly
a
yellow
label
she
sat
down
put
the
box
on
her
knees
and
looked
archly
at
sasha
do
you
like
dates
she
asked
yes
i
do
said
sasha
with
an
amused
grimace
well
i
got
some
here
for
you
she
said
with
a
serious
air
she
took
the
cover
from
the
box
and
said
take
some
she
herself
took
the
dates
one
by
one
from
the
box
and
put
them
in
sasha
mouth
making
him
kiss
her
hand
after
each
sasha
said
but
my
lips
are
sticky
that
does
matter
much
kiss
it
good
for
your
health
replied
liudmilla
gaily
i
do
object
perhaps
i
better
give
you
all
the
kisses
at
once
said
sasha
laughingly
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
a
date
himself
you
cheat
me
you
cheat
me
exclaimed
liudmilla
and
quickly
shut
the
lid
down
pinching
sasha
fingers
what
an
idea
i
quite
honest
i
wo
cheat
you
said
sasha
reassuringly
no
no
i
do
believe
you
asserted
liudmilla
well
if
you
like
i
give
you
the
kisses
beforehand
suggested
sasha
that
looks
more
like
business
said
liudmilla
here
you
are
she
stretched
out
her
hand
to
sasha
he
took
her
long
thin
fingers
kissed
them
once
and
asked
with
a
sly
smile
without
letting
go
of
her
hand
and
you
not
cheat
me
liudmillotchka
do
you
think
i
dishonest
answered
liudmilla
you
can
kiss
without
suspicion
sasha
bent
over
her
hand
and
gave
it
quick
kisses
he
covered
her
hand
with
loud
kisses
pressing
his
open
lips
against
her
hand
and
feeling
happy
that
he
could
kiss
her
so
often
liudmilla
carefully
counted
the
kisses
when
she
had
counted
ten
she
said
it
must
be
very
awkward
for
you
to
stand
and
bend
over
well
i
make
myself
more
comfortable
said
sasha
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
kissed
her
hand
with
renewed
zeal
sasha
loved
sweets
he
was
pleased
that
liudmilla
had
brought
him
some
sweet
things
for
this
he
loved
her
still
more
tenderly
liudmilla
sprinkled
sasha
with
lusciously
aromatic
scents
their
aroma
astonished
sasha
it
was
at
once
overpoweringly
sweet
intoxicating
and
radiantly
hazy
like
a
sinful
golden
sunrise
seen
through
an
early
white
mist
sasha
said
what
a
strange
perfume
try
it
on
your
hand
advised
liudmilla
and
she
gave
him
an
ugly
jar
rounded
at
the
edges
sasha
looked
at
it
against
the
light
it
was
a
bright
yellow
liquid
it
had
a
large
highly
coloured
label
with
a
french
inscription
it
was
cyclamen
from
piver
sasha
took
hold
of
the
flat
glass
stopper
pulled
it
out
and
smelled
at
the
perfume
then
he
did
as
liudmilla
liked
to
do
he
put
his
palm
on
the
mouth
of
the
bottle
turned
it
over
quickly
and
then
turned
it
upright
again
then
he
rubbed
between
his
palms
the
few
drops
of
cyclamen
that
remained
and
smelled
his
hand
attentively
the
spirit
in
the
scent
evaporated
and
the
pure
aroma
remained
liudmilla
looked
at
him
with
expectancy
sasha
said
indecisively
it
smells
a
little
of
insects
do
tell
lies
please
said
liudmilla
in
vexation
she
put
some
of
the
scent
on
her
hand
and
smelled
it
sasha
repeated
yes
of
insects
liudmilla
suddenly
flared
up
so
that
small
tears
glistened
in
her
eyes
she
struck
sasha
across
the
cheek
and
cried
oh
you
wicked
boy
that
for
your
insects
that
was
a
healthy
smack
said
sasha
and
he
laughed
and
kissed
liudmilla
hand
but
why
are
you
so
angry
dearest
liudmillotchka
what
do
you
think
it
does
smell
of
he
was
not
at
all
angry
at
the
blow
he
was
completely
bewitched
by
liudmilla
what
does
it
smell
of
asked
liudmilla
and
caught
hold
of
sasha
by
the
ear
i
tell
you
what
but
first
i
going
to
pull
your
ear
for
you
liudmillotchka
darling
i
wo
do
it
again
exclaimed
sasha
frowning
with
pain
and
pulling
away
from
her
liudmilla
let
go
of
the
reddened
ear
gently
drew
sasha
to
her
seated
him
on
her
knees
and
said
listen
three
scents
live
in
the
cyclamen
the
poor
flower
smells
of
ambrosia
that
is
for
working
bees
you
know
of
course
that
in
russian
this
is
called
repeated
sasha
laughingly
that
a
funny
name
now
do
laugh
you
young
scamp
said
liudmilla
as
she
caught
hold
of
his
other
ear
and
continued
ambrosia
and
the
bees
humming
over
it
that
the
flower
joy
the
flower
also
smells
of
vanilla
now
this
is
not
for
the
bees
but
for
him
of
whom
they
dream
and
this
is
the
flower
desire
the
flower
and
the
golden
sun
above
it
the
flower
third
perfume
smells
of
the
sweet
tender
body
for
the
lover
and
this
is
its
love
the
poor
flower
and
the
heavy
midday
sultriness
the
bee
the
sun
and
the
sultriness
do
you
understand
my
dear
sasha
silently
shook
his
head
his
smooth
face
flamed
and
his
long
dark
eyelashes
trembled
slightly
liudmilla
looked
dreamily
into
the
distance
and
said
it
gives
one
joy
the
gentle
and
sunny
cyclamen
it
draws
one
towards
desires
which
give
sweetness
and
shame
and
it
stirs
the
blood
do
you
understand
my
little
sun
when
it
feels
sweet
and
happy
and
sad
and
one
wants
to
cry
do
you
understand
that
what
it
is
she
pressed
her
lips
in
a
long
kiss
on
sasha
liudmilla
looked
pensively
in
front
of
her
suddenly
a
smile
came
across
her
lips
she
lightly
pushed
sasha
away
and
asked
do
you
like
roses
sasha
sighed
opened
his
eyes
smiled
tenderly
and
whispered
yes
large
roses
asked
liudmilla
yes
all
sorts
large
and
small
replied
sasha
quickly
and
he
gracefully
left
her
knees
and
so
you
like
little
roses
asked
liudmilla
gently
and
her
sonorous
voice
trembled
from
suppressed
laughter
yes
i
like
them
answered
sasha
quickly
liudmilla
began
to
laugh
you
stupid
you
like
strokes
with
a
rod
and
there
no
one
to
whip
you
she
exclaimed
they
both
laughed
and
flushed
desires
innocent
by
reason
of
their
being
aroused
unavoidably
made
the
chief
charm
of
their
relation
for
liudmilla
they
stirred
one
and
yet
they
were
far
from
the
coarse
repulsive
attainment
they
began
to
argue
as
to
who
was
the
strongest
liudmilla
said
well
suppose
you
are
the
strongest
what
then
the
thing
is
the
quickest
well
i
also
the
quickest
boasted
sasha
so
you
quick
exclaimed
liudmilla
teasingly
they
discussed
the
matter
at
length
at
last
liudmilla
suggested
well
let
wrestle
sasha
laughed
and
said
well
you
ca
get
the
best
of
me
liudmilla
began
to
tickle
him
so
that
your
way
he
exclaimed
as
he
giggled
and
he
wriggled
away
from
her
and
caught
her
around
the
waist
then
a
tussle
began
liudmilla
saw
at
once
that
sasha
was
the
stronger
as
she
could
not
beat
him
by
strength
she
cunningly
made
the
best
of
an
opportune
moment
and
tripped
up
sasha
foot
he
fell
and
pulled
liudmilla
down
with
him
liudmilla
easily
freed
herself
and
pressed
him
down
on
the
floor
sasha
cried
that
not
fair
liudmilla
put
her
knees
on
his
stomach
and
held
him
on
the
floor
with
her
hands
sasha
made
great
efforts
to
get
free
liudmilla
began
to
tickle
him
again
sasha
loud
laughter
mingled
with
hers
she
laughed
so
much
that
she
had
to
let
sasha
go
she
fell
to
the
floor
still
laughing
sasha
jumped
to
his
feet
he
was
red
and
rather
provoked
russalka
water
nymph
he
shouted
but
the
russalka
was
lying
on
the
floor
laughing
liudmilla
seated
sasha
on
her
knees
tired
with
the
wrestling
they
sat
happily
and
closely
looking
into
each
other
eyes
and
smiling
i
heavy
for
you
i
shall
hurt
your
knee
you
better
let
me
go
never
mind
sit
still
replied
liudmilla
affectionately
you
yourself
said
you
liked
to
caress
she
stroked
his
head
he
gently
put
his
head
against
her
she
said
you
very
handsome
sasha
sasha
grew
red
and
laughed
what
an
idea
said
he
conversations
and
thoughts
about
beauty
when
applied
to
himself
somehow
perplexed
him
he
had
never
as
yet
been
curious
to
find
out
whether
people
considered
him
handsome
or
a
monster
liudmilla
pinched
sasha
cheek
which
made
him
smile
a
pretty
red
spot
showed
on
his
cheek
liudmilla
pinched
the
other
cheek
also
sasha
did
not
protest
he
only
took
her
hand
kissed
it
and
said
you
done
enough
pinching
it
hurts
me
and
you
make
your
fingers
stiff
it
may
be
painful
but
what
a
flatterer
you
become
i
shall
have
to
do
my
lessons
said
sasha
you
must
caress
me
a
little
while
longer
for
good
luck
so
that
i
can
get
a
five
for
my
greek
so
you
sending
me
away
said
liudmilla
she
caught
hold
of
his
hand
and
rolled
the
sleeve
above
the
elbow
what
are
you
doing
asked
sasha
in
confusion
blushing
guiltily
but
liudmilla
looked
at
his
arm
admiringly
and
turned
this
way
and
that
way
what
beautiful
arms
you
got
she
said
clearly
and
happily
and
suddenly
kissed
it
near
the
elbow
sasha
tried
to
drag
his
arm
away
liudmilla
held
it
and
kissed
it
several
more
times
sasha
became
still
and
cast
down
his
eyes
and
a
strange
expression
came
over
his
clear
lips
and
under
the
shadow
of
his
thick
eyelashes
his
hot
cheeks
began
to
pale
they
said
to
each
other
sasha
escorted
liudmilla
as
far
as
the
gate
he
would
have
gone
further
but
she
forbade
it
he
paused
at
the
gate
and
said
come
again
oftener
my
dear
bring
sweeter
cakes
do
you
hear
he
used
the
familiar
thou
to
her
for
the
first
time
and
it
sounded
in
her
ear
like
a
gentle
caress
she
embraced
and
kissed
him
impetuously
and
ran
away
sasha
stood
like
one
dazed
sasha
had
promised
to
come
the
appointed
hour
had
passed
by
and
sasha
had
not
arrived
liudmilla
waited
impatiently
she
fidgeted
about
and
felt
distressed
and
looked
out
of
the
window
whenever
she
heard
steps
in
the
street
she
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
her
sisters
teased
her
she
said
angrily
let
me
alone
then
she
threw
herself
stormily
at
them
with
reproaches
because
they
laughed
at
her
it
was
already
evident
that
sasha
would
not
come
liudmilla
cried
with
vexation
and
disappointment
darya
continued
to
tease
her
liudmilla
spoke
quietly
between
her
sobs
and
in
the
midst
of
her
distress
she
forgot
to
be
angry
with
them
that
detestable
old
hag
would
let
him
come
she
keeps
him
tied
to
apron
strings
to
make
him
learn
greek
yes
and
he
a
hobbledehoy
because
he
could
get
away
said
darya
with
rough
sympathy
she
has
tied
herself
up
with
a
child
said
valeria
contemptuously
both
sisters
though
they
laughed
sympathised
with
liudmilla
they
loved
each
other
and
they
loved
tenderly
but
not
strongly
a
superficial
tender
love
darya
said
why
are
you
crying
why
should
you
weep
your
eyes
out
for
a
young
milksop
well
you
might
say
that
the
devil
has
bound
himself
to
an
infant
who
a
devil
shouted
liudmilla
angrily
why
you
answered
darya
calmly
are
young
but
darya
did
not
end
her
sentence
but
whistled
piercingly
nonsense
said
liudmilla
and
her
voice
sounded
strangely
a
strange
severe
smile
shone
on
her
face
through
her
tears
like
a
bright
flaming
ray
at
sunset
through
the
last
drops
of
a
weary
rain
darya
said
in
a
rather
annoyed
way
what
do
you
find
interesting
in
him
tell
me
please
liudmilla
still
with
the
same
curious
smile
on
her
face
said
slowly
and
pensively
how
beautiful
he
is
how
many
untouched
possibilities
he
has
that
very
cheap
said
darya
decidedly
all
small
boys
have
them
no
it
is
cheap
said
liudmilla
they
unclean
boys
and
is
he
clean
asked
valeria
she
pronounced
the
word
clean
rather
contemptuously
a
lot
you
understand
said
liudmilla
and
again
began
to
speak
quietly
and
pensively
he
quite
innocent
darya
smiled
oh
is
he
said
darya
ironically
the
best
age
for
a
boy
is
fourteen
or
fifteen
he
does
understand
anything
and
yet
he
has
a
kind
of
intuition
and
he
has
a
disgusting
beard
a
wonderful
pleasure
said
valeria
with
a
contemptuous
grimace
she
was
feeling
sad
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
small
weak
and
frail
and
she
envied
her
sisters
she
envied
darya
her
gay
laughter
and
even
liudmilla
tears
liudmilla
said
again
you
do
understand
anything
i
do
love
him
at
all
as
you
think
to
love
a
boy
is
better
than
to
fall
in
love
with
a
commonplace
face
with
moustaches
i
love
him
innocently
i
do
want
anything
from
him
if
you
do
want
anything
from
him
why
do
you
torment
him
said
darya
harshly
liudmilla
grew
red
and
a
guilty
expression
came
on
to
her
face
darya
took
pity
on
her
she
walked
up
to
liudmilla
put
her
arms
round
her
and
said
do
mind
what
we
say
it
only
our
spitefulness
liudmilla
began
to
cry
again
and
pressing
against
darya
shoulder
said
sadly
i
know
there
nothing
for
me
to
hope
for
from
him
but
if
he
would
only
caress
me
a
little
what
the
matter
said
darya
as
she
walked
away
from
liudmilla
she
put
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
sang
loudly
last
night
i
left
my
darling
valeria
broke
into
a
clear
fragile
laugh
and
liudmilla
eyes
looked
gay
and
mischievous
again
she
walked
into
her
room
impetuously
and
sprinkled
herself
with
korylopsis
the
sweet
piquant
odour
seized
upon
her
seductively
she
walked
out
into
the
street
in
her
best
clothes
feeling
distraught
and
an
indiscreet
attractiveness
was
wafted
from
her
perhaps
i
shall
meet
him
she
thought
she
did
meet
him
well
you
a
nice
one
she
exclaimed
reproachfully
and
yet
happily
sasha
felt
both
confused
and
glad
i
had
no
time
he
said
there
are
too
many
lessons
to
do
really
i
had
no
time
you
fibbing
little
one
but
come
along
he
resisted
for
a
while
but
it
was
clear
that
he
was
glad
to
let
liudmilla
take
him
away
with
her
and
liudmilla
brought
him
home
i
found
him
she
said
to
her
sisters
triumphantly
and
taking
sasha
by
the
shoulders
she
led
him
into
her
room
sasha
putting
his
hands
inside
his
belt
stood
uneasily
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
felt
both
happy
and
sad
there
seemed
to
be
an
odour
of
new
pleasant
scents
there
and
in
this
odour
there
was
something
that
provoked
and
irritated
the
nerves
like
the
contact
of
living
rough
little
snakes
rosotchki
means
little
roses
and
also
rods
and
strokes
from
a
rod
chapter
xviii
peredonov
was
returning
from
the
lodgings
of
one
of
his
pupils
quite
suddenly
he
was
caught
in
a
drizzling
rain
he
tried
to
think
where
he
could
shelter
for
a
while
so
as
not
to
spoil
his
new
silk
umbrella
in
the
rain
across
the
way
was
a
detached
stone
house
on
it
was
the
brass
plate
of
the
notary
public
goudayevsky
the
son
was
a
pupil
in
the
second
form
of
the
peredonov
decided
to
go
in
incidentally
he
would
make
a
complaint
against
the
son
he
found
both
parents
at
home
they
met
him
with
a
good
deal
of
fuss
everything
was
done
there
in
that
way
nikolai
mikhailovitch
goudayevsky
was
a
short
robust
dark
man
bald
and
with
a
long
beard
his
movements
were
impetuous
and
unexpected
he
seemed
not
to
walk
but
to
flutter
along
he
was
small
like
a
sparrow
and
it
was
always
impossible
to
tell
from
his
face
and
attitude
what
he
would
do
the
next
minute
in
the
midst
of
a
serious
conversation
he
would
suddenly
throw
out
his
knee
which
would
not
so
much
amuse
people
as
perplex
them
as
to
his
motive
at
home
or
when
visiting
he
would
sit
quiet
for
a
long
time
and
then
suddenly
jump
up
without
any
visible
cause
pace
quickly
up
and
down
the
room
and
exclaim
or
knock
something
in
the
street
he
would
walk
then
suddenly
pause
or
make
some
gesture
or
gymnastic
exercise
and
then
he
would
continue
his
walk
on
the
documents
which
he
drew
up
or
attested
goudayevsky
liked
to
write
ridiculous
remarks
as
for
example
instead
of
writing
about
ivan
ivanitch
ivanov
that
he
lived
on
the
moscow
square
in
house
he
would
write
ivan
ivanitch
ivanov
who
lived
on
the
market
square
in
that
quarter
where
it
was
impossible
to
breathe
for
the
stench
and
so
forth
and
he
even
made
a
note
sometimes
of
the
number
of
geese
and
hens
kept
by
the
man
whose
signature
he
was
attesting
julia
goudayevskaya
was
a
tall
slim
bony
woman
passionate
and
extremely
sentimental
who
in
spite
of
the
disparity
of
their
figures
resembled
her
husband
in
certain
habits
she
had
the
same
impetuous
and
disproportionate
movements
unlike
those
of
other
people
she
was
dressed
youthfully
and
in
colours
and
whenever
she
made
her
quick
movements
the
long
variegated
ribbons
with
which
she
loved
to
adorn
in
abundance
her
dress
and
hair
flew
in
all
directions
antosha
a
slender
alert
boy
bowed
courteously
peredonov
was
seated
in
the
and
he
immediately
began
to
complain
of
antosha
that
he
was
lazy
inattentive
and
did
not
listen
in
class
but
chattered
and
laughed
and
was
mischievous
during
recess
antosha
was
astonished
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
considered
such
a
wicked
boy
and
he
began
to
defend
himself
hotly
both
parents
were
annoyed
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
shouted
the
father
in
what
precisely
his
mischievousness
consists
nika

defend
him
cried
the
mother
he
should
get
up
to
mischief
but
what
mischief
has
he
done
enquired
the
father
running
almost
rolling
on
his
short
legs
he
generally
mischievous

raises
a
racket
and
he
fights
said
peredonov
morosely
he
always
in

exclaimed
antosha
dolefully
ask
anyone

peredonov
very
well
i
go

goudayevsky
decisively

the
father
i

fail
exclaimed
julia
as
she
caught
her
son
by
the
shoulder
and
was
about
to
drag
him
into
the
kitchen
antosha
she
cried
come
along
i
give
you
a
whipping
i
not
let
you
have
him
cried
the
father
tearing
his
son
away
from
her
his
mother
held
on
to
him
antosha
made
despairing
outcries
and
the
parents
tustled
with
each
other
help
me
ardalyon
borisitch
cried
julia
hold
this
monster
while
i
settle
with
antosha
peredonov
went
to
help
but
goudayevsky
got
his
son
away
from
julia
pushed
her
aside
sprang
towards
peredonov
and
cried
threateningly

here
when
two
dogs
are
fighting
the
third
one
had
better
keep
away
yes
and
i
see
to
you
red
unkempt
perspiring
he
shook
his
fist
in
the
air
peredonov
retreated
muttering
inaudible
words
julia
ran
round
her
husband
and
tried
to
catch
hold
of
antosha
his
father
hid
him
behind
and
pulled
him
by
the
arm
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
julia
her
eyes
gleaming
cried
he
grow
up
to
be
a
he
get
into
gaol
hard
be
his
fate
a
plague
on
your
tongue
cried
goudayevsky
shut
up
you
wicked
fool
oh
you
tyrant
screamed
julia
and
running
up
to
her
husband
hit
him
with
her
fist
on
the
back
and
ran
impetuously
out
of
the
goudayevsky
clenched
his
fists
and
ran
up
to
peredonov
so
you
come
to
raise
a
riot
here
he
cried
you
say
mischievous
you
a
liar
he
not
mischievous
and
if
he
were
i
should
know
it
without
you
and
i
do
want
anything

with
you
you
go
about
the
town
taking
in
fools
you
beat
their
little
boys
and
expect

get
a
master
diploma
for
birching
but
you
come
to
the
wrong
place
sir
i
ask
you
to
clear
out
as
he
was
saying
this
he
jumped
towards
peredonov
and
got
him
into
a
corner
peredonov
was
frightened
and
would
have
been
glad
to
run
away
but
goudayevsky
in
his
excitement
did
not
notice
that
he
was
standing
in
his
way
antosha
seized
hold
of
the
tails
of
his
father
and
began
to
tug
at
them
his
father
angrily
turned
on
him
and
tried
to
kick
him
but
antosha
quickly
jumped
aside
without
however
letting
go
of
his
father
coat
be
quiet
there
exclaimed
goudayevsky
do
forget
yourself
antosha
papotchka
cried
antosha
continuing
to
tug
at
his
you
are
keeping
ardalyon
borisitch
from
going
goudayevsky
quickly
jumped
to
the
side
antosha
barely
managed
to
escape
him
i
beg
your
pardon
said
goudayevsky
and
pointed
to
the
door
the
way
out
and
i
wo
detain
you
peredonov
quickly
left
the
room
goudayevsky
put
his
fingers
to
his
nose
at
him
then
made
a
motion
with
his
knee
as
if
he
were
kicking
him
out
antosha
sniggered
goudayevsky
turned
on
him
savagely
antosha
do

antosha
piteously
and
in
a
squeaking
voice
antosha

shouted
his
father
you
say
that
he
a
liar
but
that
he
made
a
mistake
only
little
boys
tell
lies
make
mistakes
in
the
meantime
peredonov
managed
to
find
his
way
into
the
hall
discovered
his
overcoat
with
some
difficulty
and
began
to
put
it
on
his
fear
and
nervousness
hindered
him
from
finding
his
sleeve
no
one
came
to
his
assistance
quite
suddenly
julia
ran
out
from
a
side
door
rustling
her
flying
ribbons
and
whispered
excitedly
in
his
ear
making
wild
gestures
and
standing
on
peredonov
did
not
at
first
understand
i
so
grateful
to
you
he
heard
at
last
it
so
good
of
you
to
take
such
an
interest
in

so
indifferent

julia
you

in
the
evening
peredonov
received
a
note
from
goudayevskaya
it
ran
most
esteemed
ardalyon
borisitch
my
husband
has
gone
to
his
club
and
now
i
am
free
from
his
savagery
until
one
do
me
the
kindness
to
come
as
soon
as
you
can
and
help
me
with
my
misbehaving
son
i
realise
that
he
must
be
rid
of
his
faults
while
he
still
young
for
afterwards
it
may
be
too
late
with
genuine
respect
julia
goudayevskaya
please
come
as
soon
as
possible
otherwise
antosha
will
go
to
sleep
and
i
shall
have
to
wake
him
peredonov
quickly
put
on
his
overcoat
wrapped
a
scarf
round
his
neck
and
prepared
to
go
where
are
you
going
so
late
ardalyon
borisitch
asked
varvara
i
going
on
business
replied
peredonov
morosely
and
left
abruptly
varvara
reflected
sadly
that
again
she
would
be
unable
to
sleep
for
some
time
if
she
could
only
hasten
the
marriage
then
she
could
sleep
both
night
and
day
that
would
be
bliss
once
in
the
street
peredonov
was
assailed
by
doubts
suppose
it
was
a
trap
and
suppose
it
suddenly
turned
out
that
goudayevsky
was
at
home
and
they
should
seize
him
and
beat
him
would
it
be
better
for
him
to
turn
back
no
i
better
go
as
far
as
the
house
and
then
i
shall
see
peredonov
decided
the
night
was
quiet
cold
and
dark
it
enveloped
him
on
all
sides
and
compelled
him
to
walk
slowly
fresh
gusts
of
wind
blew
from
the
neighbouring
fields
light
rustling
noises
could
be
heard
in
the
grass
along
the
fences
and
everything
around
him
seemed
suspicious
and
strange
perhaps
someone
was
following
stealthily
behind
and
watching
him
all
objects
were
strangely
and
unexpectedly
concealed
by
the
darkness
as
if
another
different
nocturnal
life
awoke
in
them
incomprehensible
to
man
and
hostile
to
him
peredonov
walked
quickly
in
the
streets
and
mumbled
you
wo
gain
anything
by
following
me
i
not
going
on
any
bad
business
i
going
in
the
interest
of
my
work
so
there
at
last
he
reached
goudayevsky
house
a
light
was
visible
in
one
of
the
windows
facing
the
street
the
remaining
four
were
dark
peredonov
ascended
the
steps
very
quietly
stood
a
while
and
put
his
ears
to
the
door
and
listened
everything
was
quiet
he
lightly
pulled
the
brass
handle
of
the
bell
a
distant
faint
tinkle
of
a
bell
was
heard
but
faint
though
it
was
it
frightened
peredonov
as
if
this
sound
would
awaken
all
the
hostile
powers
and
make
them
come
to
this
door
peredonov
quickly
ran
down
the
steps
and
hid
behind
a
post
pressing
close
against
the
wall
several
moments
passed
peredonov
heart
jumped
and
beat
heavily
presently
light
footsteps
could
be
heard
and
the
noise
of
a
door
opening
julia
looked
out
into
the
street
and
her
black
passionate
eyes
gleamed
in
the
darkness
who
there
she
asked
in
a
loud
whisper
peredonov
stepped
a
little
away
from
the
wall
and
looked
into
the
narrow
opening
of
the
door
where
it
was
dark
and
quiet
and
asked
also
in
a
tremulous
whisper
has
nikolai
mikhailovitch
gone
yes
he
gone
he
gone
she
whispered
joyously
peredonov
glanced
timidly
around
him
and
followed
her
into
the
dark
passage
i
sorry
i
have
no
light
whispered
julia
but
i
afraid
someone
might
see
and
they
might
gossip
she
led
peredonov
up
the
staircase
into
a
corridor
where
a
small
lamp
hung
throwing
a
dim
light
on
the
upper
stairs
julia
laughed
quietly
and
joyously
and
her
ribbons
trembled
from
her
laughter
yes
he
gone
she
whispered
gleefully
as
she
looked
around
and
scrutinised
peredonov
with
passionately
burning
eyes
i
was
afraid
he
would
remain
at
home
as
he
was
in
a
great
rage
but
he
could
do
without
his
game
of
whist
i
even
sent
the
maid
away
there
only
the
baby
nurse
in
the
house
otherwise
we
might
be
interrupted
for
you
know
what
sort
of
people
there
are
nowadays
a
heat
came
from
julia
she
was
hot
and
dry
like
a
splinter
once
or
twice
she
caught
peredonov
by
the
sleeve
and
these
quick
contacts
seemed
to
send
small
dry
fires
through
his
whole
body
they
walked
quietly
and
on
through
the
corridor
past
several
closed
doors
and
stopped
at
the
last
it
was
the
door
of
the
children
room
peredonov
left
julia
at
midnight
when
she
began
to
expect
her
husband
return
he
walked
in
the
dark
streets
morose
and
gloomy
it
seemed
to
him
that
someone
had
been
standing
by
the
house
and
was
now
following
him
he
mumbled
i
went
on
account
of
my
work
it
was
my
fault
she
wanted
it
herself
you
ca
deceive
me
you
got
the
wrong
man
varvara
was
not
yet
asleep
when
he
returned
her
cards
were
lying
in
front
of
her
it
seemed
to
peredonov
that
someone
might
step
in
when
he
entered
it
was
possible
that
varvara
herself
had
let
the
enemy
come
in
peredonov
said
if
i
go
to
sleep
you
bewitch
me
with
the
cards
give
me
the
cards
or
you
bewitch
me
he
took
the
cards
away
and
hid
them
under
his
pillow
varvara
smiled
and
said
you
making
a
fool
of
yourself
i
have
the
power
to
bewitch
anyone
and
as
if
i
wanted
it
he
felt
vexed
and
frightened
because
she
was
smiling
that
meant
he
thought
that
she
might
bewitch
him
even
without
cards
the
cat
was
shrinking
under
the
bed
and
his
green
eyes
sparkled
one
might
be
bewitched
by
his
fur
if
it
were
stroked
in
the
dark
so
that
electric
sparks
flew
from
it
behind
the
chest
of
drawers
the
grey
nedotikomka
gleamed
again
was
it
not
varvara
who
called
it
up
at
nights
with
a
slight
whistle
like
a
snore
peredonov
dreamed
a
repulsive
terrible
dream
pilnikov
came
stood
on
the
threshold
beckoned
him
and
smiled
it
was
as
if
someone
drew
him
towards
pilnikov
who
led
him
through
dark
dirty
streets
while
the
cat
ran
beside
and
his
green
eyes
gleamed
and
shone
chapter
xix
peredonov
strange
behaviour
worried
khripatch
more
and
more
he
consulted
the
school
physician
and
asked
him
whether
peredonov
were
not
out
of
his
mind
the
doctor
laughingly
replied
that
peredonov
had
no
mind
to
be
out
of
and
that
he
was
simply
acting
stupidly
there
were
also
complaints
adamenko
was
the
first
she
sent
to
the
her
brother
which
had
been
given
only
one
mark
for
a
very
good
piece
of
work
the
during
one
of
the
recesses
asked
peredonov
to
come
and
see
him
yes
it
quite
true
he
does
look
a
little
mad
thought
khripatch
when
he
saw
traces
of
perplexity
and
terror
on
peredonov
dull
gloomy
face
i
got
a
bone
to
pick
with
you
said
khripatch
quickly
and
dryly
whenever
i
have
to
work
in
a
room
next
to
yours
my
head
is
split
there
such
an
uproar
of
laughter
in
your
class
may
i
request
you
to
give
lessons
of
a
less
cheerful
nature
scoff
and
always
scoff
do
you
get
tired
it
is
my
fault
said
peredonov
they
laugh
by
themselves
it
is
impossible
to
mention
anything
from
the
grammar
or
the
satires
of
kantemir
without
their
laughing
they
are
a
bad
lot
they
ought
to
be
well
scolded
it
desirable
and
even
necessary
that
the
work
in
class
should
be
of
a
serious
character
said
khripatch
sarcastically
and
another
thing
khripatch
showed
peredonov
two
and
said
here
are
two
from
two
students
of
one
class
on
your
subject
adamenko
and
my
son
i
have
compared
them
and
i
am
compelled
to
make
the
inference
that
you
are
not
giving
your
full
attention
to
your
work
adamenko
last
work
which
was
done
very
satisfactorily
was
marked
one
while
my
son
work
written
much
worse
was
marked
four
it
is
evident
that
you
have
made
a
mistake
that
you
have
given
one
pupil
marks
to
another
and
vice
versa
though
it
is
natural
for
a
man
to
make
mistakes
still
i
must
ask
you
to
avoid
such
errors
in
future
it
quite
properly
arouses
dissatisfaction
in
the
parents
and
in
the
pupils
themselves
peredonov
mumbled
something
inaudible
from
spite
he
began
to
tease
the
smaller
boys
who
had
been
recently
punished
at
his
instigation
he
was
especially
severe
on
kramarenko
the
boy
kept
silent
and
went
pale
under
his
dark
tan
his
eyes
gleamed
as
kramarenko
left
the
that
day
he
did
not
hasten
home
he
stood
at
the
gates
and
watched
the
entrance
when
peredonov
went
out
kramarenko
followed
him
at
some
distance
waiting
till
a
few
had
got
between
him
and
peredonov
peredonov
walked
slowly
the
cloudy
weather
depressed
him
during
the
last
few
days
his
face
had
assumed
a
duller
expression
his
glance
was
either
fixed
on
something
in
the
distance
or
wandered
strangely
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
constantly
looking
into
an
object
to
his
eyes
objects
appeared
vague
or
doubled
or
meaningless
who
was
he
scrutinising
so
closely
informers
they
concealed
themselves
behind
every
object
they
whispered
and
laughed
enemies
had
sent
against
him
a
whole
army
of
informers
sometimes
peredonov
tried
quickly
to
surprise
them
but
they
always
managed
to
escape
in
time
as
if
they
sank
through
the
earth
peredonov
suddenly
heard
quick
bold
footsteps
on
the
pavement
behind
him
and
looked
around
him
in
fright
kramarenko
paused
near
him
and
looked
at
him
decidedly
resolutely
and
malignantly
with
burning
eyes
pale
thin
like
a
savage
ready
to
throw
himself
at
an
enemy
this
look
frightened
peredonov
suppose
he
should
suddenly
bite
me
he
thought
he
walked
quicker
but
kramarenko
did
not
leave
him
he
walked
slowly
and
kramarenko
kept
pace
with
him
peredonov
paused
and
said
angrily
why
are
you
following
me
you
little
dark
wretch
i
take
you
to
your
father
at
once
kramarenko
also
paused
and
continued
to
look
at
peredonov
they
stood
facing
one
another
on
the
loose
pavement
of
the
deserted
street
beside
the
grey
depressing
fence
kramarenko
trembled
and
said
in
a
hissing
voice
scoundrel
he
smiled
and
turned
to
go
away
he
made
three
steps
paused
looked
around
and
repeated
louder
what
a
scoundrel
vermin
he
spat
and
walked
away
peredonov
looked
after
him
and
then
turned
homewards
confused
and
timorous
thoughts
crowded
through
his
head
vershina
called
to
him
she
stood
smoking
behind
the
bars
of
her
wrapped
up
in
a
large
black
shawl
peredonov
did
not
at
once
recognise
her
something
malignant
in
her
figure
seemed
to
threaten
him
she
stood
like
a
black
sorceress
and
blew
out
smoke
as
if
she
were
casting
a
spell
he
spat
and
pronounced
an
exorcism
vershina
laughed
and
asked
what
the
matter
with
you
ardalyon
borisitch
peredonov
looked
vaguely
at
her
and
said
at
last
ah
it
you
i
did
recognise
you
that
a
good
sign
it
means
i
soon
be
rich
said
vershina
this
did
not
please
peredonov
he
wanted
to
be
rich
himself
get
away
he
exclaimed
angrily
why
should
you
be
rich
always
be
what
you
are
now
never
mind
i
shall
win
twenty
thousand
said
vershina
with
a
wry
smile
no
i
shall
win
the
twenty
thousand
argued
peredonov
i
shall
be
in
one
drawing
and
you
be
in
another
said
vershina
you
lying
said
peredonov
angrily
who
ever
heard
of
two
people
winning
at
once
in
the
same
town
i
tell
you
i
going
to
win
it
vershina
noticed
that
he
was
angry
she
ceased
to
argue
she
opened
the
gate
to
entice
him
in
and
said
there
no
reason
for
you
to
stand
there
come
in
mourin
here
mourin
name
recalled
something
pleasant
to
peredonov
drink
and
he
entered
in
the
darkened
by
the
trees
outside
sat
marta
looking
very
happy
with
a
red
sash
on
and
with
a
kerchief
round
her
neck
mourin
more
unkempt
than
usual
and
very
cheerful
for
some
reason
or
other
and
a
schoolboy
vitkevitch
he
paid
attentions
to
vershina
and
imagined
that
she
was
in
love
with
him
he
thought
of
leaving
the
school
marrying
vershina
and
managing
her
estate
mourin
met
peredonov
with
exaggeratedly
cordial
exclamations
his
expression
became
even
gayer
and
his
little
eyes
looked
fat
all
this
did
not
go
with
his
stout
figure
and
untidy
hair
in
which
even
some
whisps
of
straw
could
be
seen
i
attending
to
business
he
said
loudly
and
hoarsely
business
everywhere
and
here
these
charming
ladies
are
spoiling
me
with
tea
business
replied
peredonov
gruffly
what
sort
of
business
have
you
got
you
are
not
in
government
service
and
you
got
money
coming
in
now
i
have
business
well
what
if
you
have
it
only
getting
other
people
money
said
mourin
with
a
loud
laugh
vershina
smiled
wryly
and
seated
peredonov
near
the
table
on
a
round
table
near
the
sofa
glasses
and
cups
of
tea
rum
and
cranberry
jam
were
crowded
together
with
a
filigree
silver
dish
covered
with
a
knitted
doyley
a
small
of
and
gingerbread
stuck
with
almonds
a
strong
odour
of
rum
came
from
mourin
glass
of
tea
while
vitkevitch
put
a
good
deal
of
jam
into
a
small
glass
plate
shaped
like
a
shell
marta
was
eating
little
slices
of
with
visible
satisfaction
vershina
offered
peredonov
refreshments
he
refused
to
take
tea
i
might
be
poisoned
he
thought
it
very
easy
to
poison
you
you
simply
drink
and
do
notice
anything
there
are
sweet
poisons
and
then
you
go
home
and
turn
up
your
toes
and
he
felt
vexed
because
they
put
jam
before
mourin
and
when
he
came
they
did
take
the
trouble
to
get
a
new
jar
of
better
jam
they
had
cranberry
jam
only
but
several
other
kinds
vershina
really
did
give
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
mourin
seeing
that
she
had
little
hope
of
peredonov
she
was
looking
elsewhere
for
a
husband
for
marta
now
she
was
trying
to
catch
mourin
by
his
pursuit
of
gains
this
landed
proprietor
eagerly
fell
to
the
lure
marta
pleased
him
marta
was
happy
because
it
was
her
constant
desire
to
find
a
husband
and
to
have
a
good
house
and
home
that
would
be
complete
happiness
and
she
looked
at
mourin
with
loving
eyes
the
huge
man
with
his
coarse
voice
and
plain
face
seemed
to
her
in
every
movement
a
model
of
manly
strength
cleverness
beauty
and
goodness
peredonov
noticed
the
loving
glances
exchanged
by
mourin
and
marta
he
noticed
them
because
he
expected
marta
to
pay
attention
to
him
he
said
gruffly
to
mourin
you
sit
there
like
a
bridegroom
your
whole
face
is
shining
i
have
reason
to
be
happy
said
mourin
in
a
brisk
cheerful
voice
i
have
managed
my
business
very
well
he
winked
at
his
hostesses
they
both
had
gay
smiles
peredonov
asked
gruffly
contemptuously
screwing
up
his
eyes
what
is
it
have
you
found
a
bride
has
she
a
big
dowry
mourin
went
on
as
if
he
had
not
heard
these
questions
natalya
afanasyevna
there
may
god
be
good
to
her
has
agreed
to
take
charge
of
my
vaniushka
he
live
here
as
if
he
were
in
bosom
and
my
mind
will
be
at
rest
knowing
that
he
wo
be
spoiled
he
get
into
mischief
with
vladya
said
peredonov
morosely
they
burn
the
house
down
he
would
dare
shouted
mourin
do
you
worry
about
that
my
dear
natalya
afanasyevna
you
find
him
as
straight
as
a
to
cut
short
this
conversation
vershina
said
with
her
wry
smile
i
should
like
to
eat
something
tart
perhaps
you
like
some
bilberries
and
apples
i
get
them
said
marta
quickly
rising
from
her
chair
do
please
marta
ran
out
of
the
room
vershina
did
not
even
look
after
her
she
was
used
to
taking
marta
services
for
granted
she
was
sitting
deep
in
her
sofa
puffing
out
blue
curling
clouds
of
smoke
and
compared
the
two
men
talking
to
each
other
looking
at
peredonov
angrily
and
indifferently
at
mourin
gaily
and
animatedly
mourin
pleased
her
more
of
the
two
he
had
a
face
while
peredonov
could
not
even
smile
she
liked
everything
in
mourin
he
was
large
stout
attractive
spoke
in
an
agreeable
low
voice
and
was
very
respectful
to
her
vershina
even
thought
at
certain
moments
that
she
ought
to
arrange
the
matter
so
that
mourin
should
become
engaged
not
to
marta
but
to
herself
but
she
always
ended
her
reflections
by
magnanimously
yielding
him
to
marta
anyone
would
marry
me
she
thought
because
i
have
money
i
can
choose
almost
anyone
i
like
if
i
liked
i
could
even
take
this
young
man
and
she
rested
her
glance
not
without
satisfaction
on
vitkevitch
youthful
impudent
yet
handsome
face
a
boy
who
spoke
little
ate
a
great
deal
and
looked
continuously
at
vershina
smiling
insolently
marta
brought
the
bilberries
and
apples
in
an
cup
and
began
to
relate
how
she
had
dreamed
the
night
before
that
she
had
gone
to
a
wedding
as
a
where
she
ate
and
pancakes
with
mead
on
one
pancake
she
had
found
a
note
and
she
cried
when
they
took
it
from
her
and
woke
up
in
tears
you
should
have
hidden
it
on
the
quiet
so
that
no
one
could
see
it
said
peredonov
rather
gruffly
if
you
ca
even
keep
money
in
a
dream
what
sort
of
a
housewife
will
you
make
there
no
reason
to
feel
sorry
for
this
money
said
vershina
there
are
many
things
seen
in
dreams
i
feel
as
if
i
really
lost
the
money
said
marta
ingenuously
a
whole
hundred
roubles
tears
appeared
in
her
eyes
and
she
forced
a
laugh
in
order
not
to
cry
mourin
anxiously
put
his
hands
into
his
pocket
and
exclaimed
my
dear
marta
stanislavovna
do
feel
so
put
out
about
it
we
can
soon
mend
the
matter
he
took
a
note
from
his
wallet
put
it
before
marta
on
the
table
and
slapped
his
hand
into
her
palm
shouting
permit
me
no
one
will
take
this
away
marta
was
about
to
rejoice
but
suddenly
flushed
violently
and
said
in
confusion
oh
vladimir
ivanovitch
i
did
mean
that
i
ca
take
it
really
you
are
now
do
offend
me
by
refusing
it
said
mourin
with
a
laugh
not
taking
up
the
money
let
say
that
your
dream
has
become
realised
no
but
how
can
i
i
feel
ashamed
i
would
take
it
for
anything
marta
resisted
looking
with
desirous
eyes
upon
the
note
why
do
you
protest
when
it
given
to
you
said
vitkevitch
good
luck
falling
right
into
your
hands
he
continued
with
an
envious
sigh
mourin
stood
in
front
of
marta
and
said
in
a
persuasive
voice
my
dear
marta
stanislavovna
believe
me
i
give
it
with
all
my
heart
please
take
it
and
if
you
do
want
to
take
it
for
nothing
then
take
it
for
looking
after
vaniushka
as
to
my
agreement
with
natalya
afanasyevna
let
that
stand
but
this
is
for
you
for
looking
after
vanya
but
how
can
i
it
too
much
said
marta
irresolutely
it
for
the
first
and
he
bowed
very
low
to
marta
offend
me
by
refusing
it
take
it
and
be
a
sister
to
vaniushka
well
marta
you
better
take
it
said
vershina
and
thank
vladimir
ivanitch
marta
flushing
with
shame
and
pleasure
took
the
money
mourin
began
to
thank
her
ardently
you
better
marry
at
once
it
would
be
cheaper
said
peredonov
gruffly
how
generous
he
got
all
of
a
sudden
vitkevitch
roared
with
laughter
which
the
others
pretended
they
had
not
heard
vershina
began
to
tell
a
dream
of
her
own
but
peredonov
interrupted
her
before
she
had
finished
by
saying
mourin
invited
him
to
his
house
for
the
evening
i
must
go
to
vespers
said
peredonov
ardalyon
borisitch
has
suddenly
become
very
zealous
in
said
vershina
with
a
quick
dry
laugh
i
always
go
he
answered
i
believe
in
god
unlike
the
others
perhaps
i
am
the
only
one
of
that
kind
in
the
that
why
i
persecuted
the
is
an
atheist
when
you
are
free
let
me
know
said
mourin
peredonov
said
twisting
his
cap
irritatedly
in
his
hands
i
have
no
time
to
go
visiting
but
suddenly
he
recalled
that
mourin
was
very
hospitable
with
food
and
drink
so
he
said
well
i
can
come
to
you
on
monday
mourin
showed
great
pleasure
at
this
and
was
about
to
ask
vershina
and
marta
also
but
peredonov
said
i
do
want
any
ladies
we
might
get
a
little
tipsy
and
blurt
out
something
which
would
be
awkward
in
their
presence
when
peredonov
left
vershina
said
sneeringly
ardalyon
borisitch
is
acting
curiously
he
would
very
much
like
to
be
an
inspector
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
varvara
were
leading
him
by
the
nose
so
he
up
to
all
sorts
of
tricks
vladya
who
had
hidden
himself
while
peredonov
was
there
came
out
and
said
with
a
malicious
smile
the
locksmith
sons
have
found
out
from
someone
that
it
was
peredonov
who
told
about
them
they
break
his
windows
exclaimed
vitkevitch
laughing
gleefully
everything
in
the
street
seemed
hostile
and
ominous
to
peredonov
a
ram
stood
at
the
and
looked
stupidly
at
him
this
ram
so
closely
resembled
volodin
that
peredonov
felt
frightened
he
thought
that
possibly
volodin
had
turned
into
a
ram
to
spy
upon
him
how
do
we
know
he
thought
perhaps
it
is
possible
science
has
not
discovered
everything
and
it
possible
someone
does
know
something
now
there
are
the
french
a
learned
people
and
yet
magicians
and
mages
have
begun
to
spread
there
and
a
fear
took
possession
of
him
this
ram
might
kick
me
he
thought
the
ram
began
to
bleat
and
its
bleat
resembled
volodin
laughter
it
was
sharp
piercing
and
unpleasant
then
he
met
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
peredonov
went
up
to
him
and
said
in
a
whisper
you
better
watch
adamenko
she
corresponds
with
socialists
one
of
them
roubovsky
looked
at
him
in
silent
astonishment
peredonov
walked
on
further
and
thought
dejectedly
why
do
i
always
keep
coming
across
him
he
must
be
watching
me
and
he
has
put
policemen
everywhere
the
dirty
streets
the
gloomy
sky
the
pitiful
little
houses
the
ragged
children
all
these
breathed
depression
neglect
and
a
hopeless
sadness
it
a
foul
town
thought
peredonov
the
people
here
are
disgusting
and
malignant
the
sooner
i
get
to
another
town
the
better
where
the
instructors
would
bow
down
to
one
and
the
schoolboys
will
be
afraid
and
whisper
in
fear
inspector
is
coming
yes
the
higher
officials
always
live
differently
in
the
world
inspector
of
the
second
district
of
the
rouban
government
he
mumbled
under
his
nose
the
right
honourable
the
state
councillor
peredonov
that
the
way
do
you
know
who
i
am
his
excellency
of
the
national
schools
of
the
rouban
government
the
actual
state
councillor
peredonov
hats
off
hand
in
your
resignation
get
out
i
manage
you
peredonov
countenance
became
arrogant
in
his
poor
imagination
he
had
already
received
his
share
of
power
when
peredonov
returned
home
while
he
was
taking
off
his
overcoat
he
heard
shrill
sounds
from
the
it
was
volodin
laughing
peredonov
spirits
fell
he
managed
to
get
here
already
he
thought
perhaps
he
now
conspiring
with
varvara
against
me
that
why
he
laughing
he
glad
because
varvara
agrees
with
him
he
walked
angrily
and
dejectedly
into
the
the
table
was
already
set
for
dinner
varvara
met
peredonov
with
an
anxious
face
ardalyon
borisitch
she
exclaimed
think
what
happened
the
run
away
well
exclaimed
peredonov
with
an
expression
of
fear
in
his
face
why
did
you
let
it
go
you
did
expect
me
to
sew
his
tail
to
my
petticoat
did
you
asked
varvara
in
irritation
volodin
sniggered
peredonov
thought
it
had
perhaps
gone
to
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
to
purr
out
all
it
knew
about
peredonov
and
about
where
and
why
he
went
out
at
night
she
would
reveal
everything
and
would
even
mew
a
little
more
than
had
happened
more
troubles
peredonov
sat
down
on
a
chair
at
the
table
bent
his
head
twirled
the
end
of
the
tablecloth
in
his
fingers
and
became
lost
in
gloomy
reflections
cats
always
run
back
to
their
old
home
said
volodin
because
cats
get
used
to
a
place
and
not
to
their
master
a
cat
should
be
swung
round
several
times
and
then
taken
to
her
new
home
she
must
be
shown
the
way
or
otherwise
she
go
back
peredonov
listened
and
felt
consoled
so
you
think
he
gone
back
to
the
old
house
pavloushka
he
asked
undoubtedly
ardasha
replied
volodin
peredonov
rose
and
shouted
well
we
have
a
drink
pavloushka
volodin
sniggered
that
a
possibility
ardasha
he
said
it
always
possible
to
take
a
drink
we
must
get
that
cat
back
decided
peredonov
a
treasure
replied
varvara
sarcastically
i
send
klavdiushka
for
it
after
dinner
they
sat
down
to
dinner
volodin
was
in
a
cheerful
mood
and
chattered
and
laughed
a
great
deal
his
laughter
sounded
to
peredonov
like
the
bleating
of
the
ram
he
had
met
in
the
street
why
has
he
got
evil
intentions
against
me
thought
peredonov
what
does
he
want
and
peredonov
thought
that
he
would
get
volodin
on
his
side
listen
pavloushka
he
said
if
you
stop
trying
to
injure
me
then
i
buy
you
a
pound
of
the
best
every
week
you
can
suck
it
to
my
good
health
volodin
laughed
but
immediately
afterwards
looked
hurt
and
said
ardalyon
borisitch
i
have
no
idea
of
injuring
you
and
i
do
want
your
because
i
do
like
it
peredonov
became
depressed
varvara
said
sneeringly
you
made
a
big
enough
fool
of
yourself
ardalyon
borisitch
how
can
he
do
you
any
injury
any
fool
can
do
you
harm
said
peredonov
dejectedly
volodin
thrust
out
an
offended
lip
shook
his
head
and
said
if
you
have
such
an
idea
about
me
ardalyon
borisitch
then
i
can
only
say
one
thing
i
thank
you
most
humbly
if
you
think
that
way
about
me
what
have
i
to
say
what
shall
i
understand
by
this
in
what
sense
take
a
drink
pavloushka
and
pour
me
one
too
said
peredonov
do
pay
any
attention
to
him
pavel
vassilyevitch
said
varvara
consolingly
he
only
talking
his
heart
does
know
what
his
tongue
blabs
volodin
said
nothing
and
preserving
his
injured
look
began
to
pour
the
vodka
from
the
decanter
into
the
glasses
varvara
said
sarcastically
how
is
it
ardalyon
borisitch
that
you
not
afraid
to
drink
vodka
when
he
pours
it
out
perhaps
he
exorcising
it
do
you
see
his
lips
moving
peredonov
face
bore
an
expression
of
terror
he
caught
the
glass
which
volodin
had
filled
and
flung
the
vodka
on
to
the
floor
shouting
chure
me
chure
chure
chure
a
spell
against
the
may
the
evil
tongue
die
of
thirst
may
the
black
eye
burst
to
him
karachoun
death
to
me
then
he
turned
to
volodin
with
a
malignant
face
snapped
his
fingers
and
said
that
for
you
you
cunning
but
i
more
cunning
varvara
laughed
uproariously
volodin
bleating
in
an
offended
trembling
voice
said
it
you
ardalyon
borisitch
who
know
and
pronounce
all
sorts
of
magic
words
but
i
never
occupied
myself
with
black
magic
i
had
any
idea
of
bedevilling
your
vodka
or
anything
else
but
it
possible
that
it
you
who
bewitched
my
brides
from
me
what
an
idea
said
peredonov
angrily
i
do
want
your
brides
i
can
get
them
by
cleaner
means
you
cast
a
spell
to
burst
my
eyes
continued
volodin
but
mind
your
spectacles
do
burst
sooner
peredonov
caught
his
glasses
in
fear
what
nonsense
he
growled
you
let
your
tongue
run
away
with
you
varvara
looked
warningly
at
volodin
and
said
crossly
do
be
spiteful
pavel
vassilyevitch
eat
your
soup
or
else
get
cold
eat
you
spiteful
thing
she
thought
that
ardalyon
borisitch
had
exorcised
himself
in
time
volodin
began
to
eat
his
soup
they
were
all
silent
for
a
while
and
presently
volodin
said
in
a
hurt
voice
no
wonder
i
dreamed
last
night
that
i
was
being
smeared
with
honey
did
you
smear
me
ardalyon
borisitch
that
not
the
way
you
ought
to
be
smeared
said
varvara
still
crossly
why
should
i
be
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
said
volodin
well
because
you
got
a
nasty
tongue
explained
varvara
you
ought
to
babble
everything
that
comes
into
your
mind
immediately

chapter
xx
in
the
evening
peredonov
went
to
the
club
he
had
been
invited
to
play
cards
goudayevsky
the
notary
was
also
there
peredonov
was
frightened
when
he
saw
him
but
goudayevsky
conducted
himself
quietly
and
peredonov
felt
reassured
they
played
a
long
time
and
drank
a
good
deal
late
at
night
in
the
refreshment
room
goudayevsky
ran
up
to
peredonov
and
without
any
explanation
hit
him
several
times
in
the
face
broke
his
glasses
and
quickly
left
the
club
peredonov
showed
no
resistance
pretended
he
was
drunk
then
fell
to
the
floor
and
began
to
grunt
they
shook
him
and
carried
him
home
the
next
day
the
whole
town
was
talking
about
this
scuffle
that
same
evening
varvara
found
an
opportunity
to
steal
the
first
forged
letter
from
peredonov
grushina
had
insisted
on
this
so
that
no
discrepancies
might
be
found
by
comparing
the
two
forgeries
peredonov
carried
this
letter
about
with
him
but
on
this
evening
he
happened
to
leave
it
at
home
while
changing
into
his
dress
clothes
he
had
taken
the
letter
from
his
pocket
put
it
under
a
on
the
chest
of
drawers
and
promptly
forgotten
it
varvara
burnt
it
over
a
candle
at
grushina
when
peredonov
returned
home
late
that
night
and
varvara
saw
his
broken
spectacles
he
told
her
that
they
had
burst
of
themselves
she
believed
him
and
imagined
that
it
was
all
the
fault
of
volodin
evil
tongue
peredonov
also
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
due
to
volodin
the
next
day
however
grushina
told
varvara
the
details
of
the
scuffle
at
the
club
in
the
morning
when
dressing
peredonov
suddenly
remembered
the
letter
looked
for
it
unavailingly
and
felt
terrified
he
shouted
in
a
savage
voice
varvara
where
that
letter
varvara
was
disconcerted
what
letter
she
asked
looking
at
peredonov
with
frightened
eyes
the
princess
shouted
peredonov
varvara
somehow
collected
herself
she
said
with
an
impudent
smile
how
should
i
know
where
it
is
you
must
have
thrown
it
among
the
waste
paper
and
klavdiushka
has
probably
burnt
it
you
better
look
in
your
pockets
for
it
if
it
still
to
be
found
peredonov
went
to
the
in
a
gloomy
state
of
mind
unpleasantness
came
into
his
mind
he
thought
of
kramarenko
how
did
this
impudent
boy
dare
to
call
him
a
scoundrel
that
meant
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
peredonov
perhaps
the
boy
knew
something
about
him
and
would
inform
against
him
in
class
kramarenko
stared
at
peredonov
and
smiled
which
terrified
peredonov
even
more
after
the
third
class
peredonov
was
again
called
to
see
the
he
went
vaguely
apprehending
something
unpleasant
rumours
of
peredonov
doings
reached
khripatch
from
all
sides
that
morning
he
had
been
told
about
last
night
occurrence
at
the
club
yesterday
also
after
lessons
volodya
boultyakov
had
come
to
see
him
the
boy
who
had
been
punished
by
his
landlady
at
request
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
this
visit
with
similar
consequences
the
boy
complained
to
the
in
a
dry
sharp
voice
khripatch
repeated
to
peredonov
the
reports
that
had
reached
him
from
reliable
sources
he
added
of
how
peredonov
had
been
going
to
his
students
homes
giving
their
parents
and
guardians
false
information
about
the
children
conduct
and
progress
demanding
that
the
boys
should
be
whipped
in
consequence
of
which
certain
disagreeable
incidents
had
occurred
among
the
parents
as
for
instance
last
night
affair
at
the
club
with
the
notary
goudayevsky
peredonov
listened
fearfully
and
yet
irritatedly
khripatch
was
silent
what
of
that
said
peredonov
in
a
surly
voice
it
was
he
who
struck
me
is
that
the
way
to
behave
he
had
no
right
to
fly
into
my
face
he
does
go
to
church
he
believes
in
a
monkey
and
he
corrupting
his
son
into
the
same
sect
he
ought
to
be
reported
he
a
socialist
khripatch
listened
attentively
to
peredonov
and
said
insinuatingly
all
this
is
not
our
affair
and
i
do
understand
at
all
what
you
mean
by
the
original
expression
believes
in
a
monkey
in
my
opinion
there
no
need
to
enrich
the
history
of
religion
with
cults
as
for
the
affront
you
received
you
ought
to
have
brought
him
before
a
court
of
magistrates
but
the
very
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
leave
the
school
this
would
be
the
best
way
out
for
you
personally
and
for
the
i
shall
be
an
inspector
said
peredonov
angrily
but
until
then
continued
khripatch
you
should
restrain
yourself
from
these
extraordinary
visits
you
will
agree
that
such
conduct
is
unbecoming
to
a
schoolmaster
and
it
loses
the
master
his
dignity
in
the
eyes
of
his
pupils
to
go
about
from
house
to
house
whipping
young
boys
this
you
must
agree
khripatch
did
not
finish
and
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
after
all
said
peredonov
i
did
it
for
their
good
please
do
let
us
argue
about
it
khripatch
interrupted
him
sharply
i
request
you
most
emphatically
not
to
let
this
happen
again
peredonov
looked
angrily
at
the
that
evening
they
decided
to
have
a
they
invited
all
their
acquaintances
peredonov
walked
about
the
rooms
to
see
that
everything
was
in
order
and
that
there
was
nothing
which
could
be
the
cause
of
his
being
informed
against
he
thought
well
everything
seems
all
right
there
are
no
forbidden
books
visible
the
are
alight
the
royal
portraits
are
hanging
in
the
place
of
honour
on
the
wall
suddenly
mickiewicz
winked
at
him
from
the
wall
he
might
get
me
into
trouble
thought
peredonov
in
fear
i
better
take
the
portrait
and
put
it
in
the
privy
and
bring
pushkin
back
here
after
all
pushkin
was
a
courtier
he
thought
as
he
hung
the
portrait
on
the
wall
then
he
remembered
that
they
would
play
cards
in
the
evening
so
he
decided
to
examine
the
cards
he
took
the
opened
pack
of
cards
which
had
only
been
used
once
and
looked
through
them
as
if
he
were
trying
to
find
something
the
faces
of
the
court
cards
did
not
please
him
they
had
such
big
eyes
latterly
when
he
was
playing
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
cards
smiled
like
varvara
even
the
ordinary
six
of
spades
had
an
insolent
and
unfriendly
look
peredonov
gathered
together
all
the
cards
he
had
and
put
out
the
eyes
of
all
the
kings
queens
and
knaves
so
that
they
should
not
stare
at
him
he
did
this
first
with
the
cards
that
had
already
been
used
and
afterwards
he
unsealed
the
new
packs
he
did
this
with
furtive
glances
around
him
as
if
he
were
afraid
that
he
would
be
detected
luckily
for
him
varvara
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
and
did
not
come
into
the
rooms
how
could
she
leave
such
an
abundance
of
eatables
klavdia
might
help
herself
when
she
wanted
anything
from
one
of
the
rooms
she
sent
klavdia
each
time
klavdia
came
into
the
room
peredonov
trembled
hid
the
scissors
in
his
pocket
and
pretended
that
he
was
dealing
the
cards
for
patience
while
peredonov
was
in
this
way
depriving
the
kings
and
queens
of
any
possibility
of
their
irritating
him
with
their
stares
an
unpleasantness
was
approaching
him
from
another
side
the
hat
which
peredonov
had
thrown
on
the
stove
of
his
former
house
in
order
to
keep
from
wearing
it
had
been
found
by
ershova
she
suspected
that
the
hat
had
not
been
left
there
by
a
simple
accident
her
former
tenants
detested
her
and
it
was
likely
ershova
thought
that
they
had
put
a
spell
in
the
hat
which
would
prevent
others
from
taking
the
house
in
fear
and
vexation
she
took
the
hat
to
a
sorceress
the
latter
looked
at
the
hat
whispered
something
over
it
mysteriously
and
severely
spat
to
each
of
the
four
quarters
and
said
to
ershova
they
done
you
some
harm
and
you
ought
to
pay
them
back
a
strong
sorcerer
has
made
the
spell
but
i
am
more
cunning
and
i
will
outdo
him
and
i
get
the
better
of
him
and
for
a
long
time
she
recited
her
spells
over
the
hat
and
having
received
generous
gifts
from
ershova
she
told
her
that
she
was
to
give
the
hat
to
a
young
man
with
red
hair
and
that
he
should
take
it
to
peredonov
house
give
it
to
the
first
person
he
met
there
and
then
run
away
without
turning
round
as
it
happened
the
first
boy
whom
ershova
met
was
one
of
the
locksmith
sons
who
had
a
grudge
against
peredonov
for
revealing
their
nocturnal
prank
he
took
with
great
satisfaction
the
piece
ershova
gave
him
and
on
the
way
he
spat
zealously
into
the
hat
on
his
own
account
he
met
varvara
herself
in
the
dark
hall
of
peredonov
house
he
stuck
the
hat
into
her
hand
and
ran
away
so
quickly
that
varvara
had
not
time
to
recognise
him
peredonov
had
barely
time
enough
to
blind
the
last
knave
when
varvara
entered
his
room
astonished
and
rather
frightened
and
said
in
a
trembling
voice
ardalyon
borisitch
look
at
this
peredonov
looked
and
almost
fell
over
in
his
terror
the
very
hat
which
he
had
tried
to
get
rid
of
was
now
in
varvara
hands
all
crumpled
up
dusty
with
scarcely
a
trace
of
its
former
magnificence
he
asked
panting
with
fear
where
did
it
come
from
varvara
recounted
in
a
frightened
voice
how
she
had
received
the
hat
from
a
nimble
boy
who
seemed
to
rise
from
the
ground
in
front
of
her
and
then
vanish
into
it
again
she
said
it
must
be
ershikha
she
has
thrown
a
spell
on
to
your
hat
there
ca
be
any
doubt
about
it
peredonov
mumbled
something
incoherent
and
his
teeth
chattered
with
fear
gloomy
fears
and
forebodings
tormented
him
he
walked
up
and
down
frowning
and
the
grey
nedotikomka
ran
under
the
chairs
and
sniggered
the
guests
arrived
early
they
brought
many
tarts
apples
and
pears
to
the
house
warming
varvara
accepted
everything
gladly
saying
merely
from
politeness
why
did
you
take
the
trouble
to
bring
such
lovely
things
but
if
she
thought
that
someone
had
brought
something
poor
or
cheap
she
felt
angry
she
was
also
displeased
when
two
guests
brought
the
same
thing
they
lost
no
time
but
sat
down
at
once
to
play
cards
they
played
stoukolka
good
heavens
exclaimed
grushina
suddenly
i
got
a
blind
king
and
my
queen
has
no
eyes
said
prepolovenskaya
examining
her
cards
and
the
knave
too
the
guests
laughingly
examined
their
cards
prepolovensky
said
i
wondered
why
these
cards
kept
catching
each
other
that
the
reason
i
kept
feeling
why
is
it
i
thought
that
they
have
such
rough
backs
now
i
see
it
comes
from
these
little
holes
that
it
it
the
backs
that
are
rough
everyone
laughed
except
peredonov
who
looked
morose
varvara
said
with
a
smile
you
know
my
ardalyon
borisitch
has
strange
whims
he
always
thinking
of
different
tricks
why
did
you
do
it
asked
routilov
with
a
loud
laugh
why
should
they
have
eyes
said
peredonov
morosely
they
do
need
to
see
everyone
roared
with
laughter
but
peredonov
remained
morose
and
silent
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
blinded
figures
were
making
wry
faces
mocking
at
him
and
winking
with
the
gaping
little
holes
in
their
eyes
perhaps
thought
peredonov
they
managed
to
learn
to
see
with
their
noses
he
had
bad
luck
as
he
nearly
always
did
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
faces
of
the
kings
queens
and
knaves
expressed
spite
and
mockery
the
queen
of
spades
even
gritted
her
teeth
evidently
enraged
by
his
blinding
her
finally
after
a
heavy
loss
peredonov
seized
the
pack
of
cards
and
in
his
rage
began
to
tear
them
to
shreds
the
guests
roared
with
laughter
varvara
said
with
a
smile
he
always
like
that
whenever
he
takes
a
drop
he
always
does
strange
things
you
mean
when
he
drunk
said
prepolovenskaya
spitefully
do
you
hear
ardalyon
borisitch
what
your
cousin
thinks
of
you
varvara
flushed
and
said
angrily
why
do
you
twist
my
words
prepolovenskaya
smiled
and
was
silent
a
new
pack
of
cards
was
produced
in
place
of
the
torn
pack
and
the
game
was
continued
suddenly
a
crash
was
heard
a
pane
of
glass
was
broken
and
a
stone
fell
on
the
floor
near
peredonov
under
the
window
could
be
heard
a
whispering
laughter
and
then
quickly
receding
footsteps
everyone
jumped
from
his
place
in
alarm
the
women
screamed
as
they
always
do
they
picked
up
the
stone
and
examined
it
fearfully
no
one
ventured
near
the
window
they
first
sent
klavdia
into
the
street
and
only
when
she
came
back
saying
that
the
street
was
deserted
did
they
examine
the
broken
window
volodin
suggested
that
the
stone
had
been
thrown
by
some
schoolboys
his
guess
seemed
a
likely
one
and
everyone
looked
significantly
at
peredonov
peredonov
frowned
and
mumbled
something
incoherently
the
guests
began
to
talk
of
the
boys
of
the
place
remarking
how
impudent
and
wild
they
were
it
was
of
course
not
the
schoolboys
but
the
locksmith
sons
the
put
the
boys
up
to
it
announced
peredonov
suddenly
he
always
trying
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
he
thought
of
this
to
annoy
me
well
that
a
fine
idea
shouted
routilov
with
a
loud
laugh
everyone
laughed
grushina
alone
said
well
what
do
you
expect
he
such
a
poisonous
man
anything
might
be
expected
of
him
he
does
do
it
himself
but
puts
his
sons
up
to
it
it
does
make
any
difference
that
they
aristocrats
bleated
volodin
in
an
injured
tone
anything
might
be
expected
from
aristocrats
many
of
the
guests
then
began
to
think
that
perhaps
it
was
time
they
stopped
laughing
you
seem
to
have
bad
luck
with
glass
ardalyon
borisitch
said
routilov
first
your
spectacles
were
broken
and
now
they
smashed
your
window
this
evoked
a
new
outburst
of
laughter
broken
windows
mean
long
life
said
prepolovenskaya
with
a
restrained
smile
when
peredonov
and
varvara
were
going
to
bed
that
night
it
seemed
to
him
that
varvara
had
something
evil
in
her
mind
he
took
from
her
the
knives
and
forks
and
hid
them
under
the
mattress
he
mumbled
in
a
slow
dull
way
i
know
you
as
soon
as
you
marry
me
you
inform
against
me
in
order
to
get
rid
of
me
you
get
a
pension
and
i
be
in
petropavlosk
jail
working
on
the
treadmill
that
night
peredonov
mind
wandered
dim
terrible
figures
walked
about
noiselessly
kings
and
knaves
swinging
their
sceptres
they
whispered
to
each
other
tried
to
hide
from
peredonov
and
stealthily
crept
towards
him
under
the
pillow
but
soon
they
grew
bolder
and
began
to
walk
and
run
and
stir
around
peredonov
everywhere
upon
the
floor
upon
the
bed
upon
the
pillows
they
whispered
they
mocked
at
peredonov
thrust
out
their
tongues
at
him
made
terrible
grimaces
before
him
stretching
out
their
mouths
into
deformed
shapes
peredonov
saw
that
they
were
little
and
mischievous
that
they
would
not
kill
him
but
were
only
deriding
him
and
foreboding
evil
but
he
felt
a
terrible
fear
now
he
muttered
exorcisms
fragments
of
spells
he
had
heard
in
his
childhood
now
he
began
to
curse
them
and
to
drive
them
from
him
waving
his
arms
and
shouting
in
a
hoarse
voice
varvara
woke
and
called
out
irately
what
are
you
making
such
a
row
about
ardalyon
borisitch
you
let
me
sleep
the
queen
of
spades
is
annoying
me
she
got
a
quilted
capote
on
mumbled
peredonov
varvara
rose
grumbling
and
cursing
and
gave
peredonov
some
medicine
in
the
local
district
newspaper
a
short
article
appeared
recounting
how
a
certain
madame
whipped
schoolboys
who
lived
in
her
house
sons
of
the
best
local
gentry
the
notary
goudayevsky
carried
this
news
over
the
whole
town
and
waxed
indignant
and
various
other
absurd
rumours
about
the
local
went
through
the
town
they
talked
about
the
girl
who
was
dressed
up
as
a
schoolboy
later
the
name
of
pilnikov
came
gradually
to
be
mentioned
with
liudmilla
sasha
companions
began
to
tease
him
about
his
love
for
liudmilla
at
first
he
regarded
their
jests
lightly
but
later
he
would
sometimes
get
indignant
and
defend
liudmilla
trying
to
convince
them
that
nothing
of
the
sort
had
happened
this
made
him
ashamed
to
go
to
liudmilla
and
yet
it
drew
him
more
strongly
to
her
confused
burning
feelings
of
shame
and
attraction
agitated
him
and
vaguely
passionate
visions
filled
his
imagination
chapter
xxi
on
sunday
when
peredonov
and
varvara
were
lunching
someone
entered
the
hall
varvara
went
up
to
the
door
stealthily
as
was
her
habit
and
looked
out
with
the
same
stealthiness
she
returned
to
the
table
and
whispered
the
postman
we
better
give
him
a
vodka
he
brought
another
letter
peredonov
silently
nodded
he
did
grudge
anyone
a
glass
of
vodka
varvara
shouted
postman
come
in
here
the
postman
entered
the
room
he
rummaged
in
his
bag
and
pretended
to
be
searching
for
the
letter
varvara
filled
a
large
and
cut
off
a
piece
of
pie
the
postman
watched
her
greedily
in
the
meantime
peredonov
was
trying
to
think
whom
the
postman
resembled
at
last
he
recalled
he
was
the
same
knave
who
had
made
him
lose
so
heavily
at
cards
he
trick
me
again
thought
peredonov
dejectedly
and
made
a
koukish
in
his
pocket
the
knave
gave
the
letter
to
varvara
it
for
you
he
said
respectfully
thanked
them
for
the
vodka
drank
it
grunted
with
satisfaction
picked
up
the
piece
of
pie
and
walked
out
varvara
turned
the
letter
and
without
opening
it
held
it
out
to
peredonov
there
read
it
i
think
it
from
the
princess
she
said
with
a
smile
what
the
good
of
her
writing
it
would
be
much
better
if
she
gave
you
the
job
instead
peredonov
hands
trembled
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
quickly
read
the
letter
then
he
jumped
up
from
his
place
waved
the
letter
and
cried
out
hurrah
three
inspector
jobs
and
i
can
have
which
one
i
want
hurrah
varvara
we
got
it
at
last
he
began
to
dance
and
twirl
round
the
room
with
his
immovably
red
face
and
dull
eyes
he
seemed
like
a
monstrously
large
mechanical
dancing
doll
varvara
smiled
and
looked
at
him
happily
he
shouted
now
it
decided
varvara
we
get
married
he
caught
varvara
by
the
shoulders
and
began
to
whirl
her
around
the
table
stamping
with
his
feet
a
russian
dance
varvara
he
shouted
varvara
put
her
arms
akimbo
and
glided
off
into
a
dance
peredonov
danced
before
her
in
the
russian
squat
volodin
entered
and
bleated
joyously
the
future
inspector

peredonov
klavdia

in
at
the
door
volodin

and
grimacing

together

make
merry
with
the
future
inspector
klavdia
gave
a
hoot
and
glided
into
the
dance
moving
her
shoulders
volodin
adroitly
whirled
round
in
front
of
her
now
he
squatted
now
he
whirled
round
now
he
jumped
forward
clapping
his
hands
together
he
was
especially
adroit
when
he
lifted
his
knee
and
clapped
his
hands
underneath
the
knee
the
floor
vibrated
under
their
heels
klavdia
was
overjoyed
to
have
such
a
clever
partner
when
they
got
tired
they
sat
down
at
the
table
and
klavdia
ran
off
into
the
kitchen
laughing
gaily
they
drank
vodka
and
they
drank
beer
they
jingled
bottles
and
glasses
they
shouted
laughed
waved
their
arms
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
afterwards
peredonov
and
volodin
went
off
to
the
peredonov
was
in
a
hurry
to
boast
about
the
letter
in
the
they
found
the
usual
company
peredonov
showed
his
letter
to
his
friends
it
created
a
great
impression
everyone
examined
it
trustfully
routilov
went
pale
muttered
something
and
spat
the
postman
brought
it
when
i
was
there
exclaimed
peredonov
i
unsealed
the
letter
myself
that
means
that
there
no
mistake
his
friends
looked
at
him
with
respect
a
letter
from
a
princess
peredonov
went
impetuously
from
the
to
vershina
he
walked
quickly
and
evenly
swinging
his
arms
measuredly
and
mumbling
to
himself
his
face
had
no
apparent
expression
of
any
kind
it
was
motionless
like
that
of
a
doll
and
a
sort
of
avid
fire
gleamed
dully
in
his
eyes
the
day
turned
out
clear
and
warm
marta
was
knitting
a
sock
her
thoughts
were
confused
and
devout
at
first
she
thought
about
sins
but
later
she
turned
her
thoughts
to
something
more
pleasant
and
began
to
reflect
about
virtues
her
thoughts
became
with
drowsiness
and
assumed
the
forms
of
definite
images
and
proportionately
at
their
comprehensibility
ceased
to
be
expressible
in
words
their
chimerical
contours
increased
in
clearness
the
virtues
stood
up
before
her
like
big
pretty
dolls
in
white
dresses
all
shining
and
fragrant
they
promised
her
rewards
and
keys
jingled
in
their
hands
and
bridal
veils
fluttered
on
their
heads
one
among
them
was
curious
and
different
from
the
others
she
promised
nothing
but
looked
reproachfully
and
her
lips
moved
with
a
noiseless
threat
it
seemed
that
if
she
spoke
a
word
one
would
feel
terrible
marta
guessed
that
this
was
conscience
she
was
in
black
this
strange
painful
visitor
with
black
eyes
and
black
hair
and
she
suddenly
began
to
talk
about
something
very
quickly
and
glibly
she
began
to
resemble
vershina
marta
started
answered
something
to
her
question
answered
almost
unconsciously
and
then
drowsiness
again
overcame
her
whether
it
was
conscience
or
whether
it
was
vershina
sitting
opposite
her
talking
quickly
and
glibly
but
incomprehensibly
smoking
something
exotic
this
person
was
assertive
quiet
and
determined
that
everything
should
be
as
she
wanted
it
marta
tried
to
look
this
tedious
visitor
straight
in
the
eyes
but
somehow
she
could
the
visitor
smiled
strangely
grumbled
and
her
eyes
wandered
off
somewhere
and
rested
on
distant
unknown
objects
which
marta
found
fearful
to
look
at
loud
talk
awakened
marta
peredonov
stood
in
the
and
greeted
vershina
in
a
loud
voice
marta
looked
around
in
fear
her
heart
beat
her
eyes
were
still
and
her
thoughts
were
still
wandering
where
was
conscience
or
had
she
not
been
there
at
all
and
ought
she
to
have
been
there
ah
you
been
snoozing
there
said
peredonov
to
her
you
were
snoring
in
all
sorts
of
ways
now
you
a
pine
marta
did
not
understand
his
pun
but
smiled
guessing
from
the
smile
on
vershina
lips
that
something
had
been
said
which
had
to
be
accepted
as
amusing
you
ought
to
be
called
sofya
continued
peredonov
why
asked
marta
because
you
sonya
and
not
marta
peredonov
sat
down
on
the
bench
beside
marta
and
said
i
have
a
very
important
piece
of
news
what
sort
of
news
can
you
have
said
vershina
share
it
with
us
and
marta
immediately
envied
vershina
because
she
had
such
a
vast
number
of
words
to
express
the
simple
question
what
is
it
guess
said
peredonov
in
a
morose
solemn
voice
how
can
i
guess
what
sort
of
news
you
have
replied
vershina
you
tell
us
and
then
we
shall
know
what
your
news
is
peredonov
felt
unhappy
because
they
did
not
want
to
try
and
guess
his
news
he
sat
there
silently
hunched
up
awkwardly
dull
and
heavy
and
looked
motionlessly
before
him
vershina
smoked
and
smiled
wryly
showing
her
dark
yellow
teeth
why
should
i
guess
your
news
this
way
she
said
after
a
short
silence
let
me
find
it
out
in
the
cards
marta
bring
the
cards
here
marta
rose
but
peredonov
gruffly
stopped
her
sit
still
i
do
want
them
find
out
without
them
but
do
bother
me
with
the
cards
but
now
you
ca
do
it
at
my
expense
i
show
you
a
trick
that
make
you
open
your
mouths
wide
peredonov
took
his
wallet
quickly
from
his
pocket
and
showed
vershina
a
letter
in
an
envelope
without
letting
it
go
from
his
hands
do
you
see
he
said
here
the
envelope
and
here
the
letter
he
took
out
the
letter
and
read
it
slowly
with
a
dull
expression
of
gratified
spite
in
his
eyes
vershina
was
dumbfounded
to
the
very
last
she
had
not
believed
in
the
princess
but
now
she
understood
that
the
affair
with
marta
was
conclusively
off
she
smiled
wryly
and
said
well
you
in
luck
marta
with
an
astonished
and
frightened
face
smiled
in
a
flustered
way
well
what
do
you
think
now
said
peredonov
maliciously
you
thought
i
was
a
fool
but
i
come
out
best
you
spoke
about
the
envelope
well
here
the
envelope
no
there
no
mistake
about
it
he
hit
the
table
with
his
fist
neither
violently
nor
loudly
and
his
movement
and
the
sound
of
his
words
remained
somehow
strangely
distant
as
if
he
were
foreign
and
indifferent
to
his
own
affairs
vershina
and
marta
exchanged
glances
in
a
perplexed
way
why
are
you
looking
at
each
other
said
peredonov
crossly
nothing
for
you
to
look
at
each
other
about
everything
settled
now
and
i
shall
marry
varvara
there
were
a
lot
of
little
girls
trying
to
catch
me
here
vershina
sent
marta
for
cigarettes
and
marta
gladly
ran
from
the
she
felt
herself
free
and
as
she
went
over
the
little
sandy
paths
strewn
with
the
autumn
leaves
near
the
house
she
met
vladya
barefoot
and
she
felt
even
gayer
and
more
cheerful
he
going
to
marry
varvara
that
decided
she
said
happily
in
a
low
voice
as
she
drew
her
brother
into
the
house
in
the
meantime
peredonov
without
waiting
for
marta
abruptly
took
his
leave
i
have
no
time
he
said
getting
married
is
not
making
a
pair
of
vershina
did
not
detain
him
and
said
to
him
coldly
she
was
intensely
vexed
until
now
she
still
had
kept
the
frail
hope
that
she
would
marry
marta
to
peredonov
and
keep
mourin
for
herself
and
now
the
last
hope
had
vanished
marta
caught
it
hot
that
day
that
made
her
cry
peredonov
left
vershina
and
thought
he
would
like
to
smoke
he
suddenly
saw
a
policeman
standing
in
the
corner
of
the
street
shelling
dry
sunflower
seeds
peredonov
felt
depressed
another
spy
he
thought
they
watching
so
as
to
have
some
excuse
for
finding
fault
with
me
he
did
not
dare
to
light
the
cigarette
which
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
but
walked
up
to
the
policeman
and
asked
timidly
policeman
is
one
allowed
to
smoke
here
the
policeman
touched
his
cap
and
inquired
respectfully
why
do
you
ask
me
sir
a
cigarette
explained
peredonov
may
one
smoke
a
cigarette
here
there
been
no
law
about
it
replied
the
policeman
evasively
there
has
been
any
repeated
peredonov
in
a
depressed
voice
no
there
has
been
any
we
are
ordered
to
stop
gentlemen
from
smoking
and
if
such
a
rule
has
been
passed
i
do
know
about
it
if
there
has
been
any
then
i
wo
begin
said
peredonov
humbly
i
am
a
person
i
will
even
throw
the
cigarette
away
after
all
i
a
state
councillor
peredonov
crumpled
up
the
cigarette
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
and
already
began
to
fear
that
he
had
said
something
inadvised
and
walked
rapidly
home
the
policeman
looked
after
him
in
perplexity
and
at
last
decided
that
the
gentleman
had
had
a
drop
too
much
and
comforted
by
this
recommenced
his
peaceful
shelling
of
sunflower
seeds
the
street
is
standing
up
on
end
muttered
peredonov
the
hill
ran
up
a
not
very
steep
incline
and
then
went
down
abruptly
on
the
other
side
at
the
crest
of
the
street
between
two
hovels
was
a
sharp
outline
against
the
blue
melancholy
evening
sky
poor
life
seemed
to
have
shut
herself
in
within
these
quiet
narrow
limits
and
suffered
keen
torments
the
trees
thrust
their
branches
over
the
fences
they
peered
over
and
obstructed
the
way
and
there
was
a
taunt
and
menace
in
their
whispering
a
ram
stood
at
the
and
looked
dully
at
peredonov
suddenly
the
sound
of
bleating
laughter
came
from
round
a
corner
volodin
appeared
and
went
to
greet
peredonov
peredonov
looked
at
him
gloomily
and
thought
of
the
ram
which
had
been
there
a
moment
ago
and
had
now
disappeared
that
he
thought
is
certainly
because
volodin
can
turn
himself
into
a
ram
he
does
resemble
a
ram
for
nothing
and
it
difficult
to
tell
whether
he
laughing
or
bleating
these
thoughts
so
preoccupied
him
that
he
did
not
hear
what
volodin
was
saying
to
him
why
are
you
kicking
me
pavloushka
he
said
dejectedly
volodin
smiled
and
said
bleatingly
i
not
kicking
you
ardalyon
borisitch
i
shaking
hands
with
you
it
possible
that
in
your
village
they
kick
with
their
hands
but
in
my
village
they
kick
with
their
feet
and
even
then
it
is
not
people
but
if
i
may
say
so
ponies
you
butt
me
yet
growled
peredonov
volodin
was
offended
and
said
in
a
trembling
voice
i
have
grown
any
horns
yet
ardalyon
borisitch
but
it
very
likely
you
grow
them
before
i
do
you
got
a
long
tongue
that
babbles
nonsense
said
peredonov
angrily
if
that
your
idea
of
me
ardalyon
borisitch
said
volodin
quickly
then
i
be
silent
and
his
face
bore
an
injured
expression
and
his
lips
protruded
nevertheless
he
walked
at
peredonov
side
he
had
not
yet
dined
and
he
counted
on
having
dinner
with
peredonov
luckily
they
had
invited
him
that
morning
an
important
piece
of
news
awaited
peredonov
at
home
while
still
in
the
hall
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
something
unusual
had
happened
a
bustling
could
be
heard
in
the
rooms
mingled
with
frightful
exclamations
peredonov
at
once
thought
that
the
dinner
was
not
ready
and
that
when
they
saw
him
coming
they
had
been
frightened
and
were
now
hurrying
it
was
pleasant
to
him
to
know
that
they
were
afraid
of
him
but
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
another
matter
varvara
ran
out
into
the
hall
and
shouted
the
cat
been
sent
back
in
her
excitement
she
did
not
notice
volodin
at
first
as
usual
her
dress
was
untidy
a
greasy
blouse
over
a
grey
dirty
skirt
and
house
slippers
her
hair
was
uncombed
and
tousled
she
said
to
peredonov
excitedly
it
irishka
again
she
played
us
a
new
trick
out
of
spite
she
sent
a
boy
here
again
to
throw
the
cat
in
here
and
the
cat
has
rattles
on
its
tail
and
they
keep
on
rattling
the
cat
has
got
under
the
sofa
and
wo
come
out
peredonov
felt
terribly
alarmed
what
to
be
done
now
he
asked
pavel
vassilyevitch
said
varvara
you
younger
fetch
the
cat
out
from
under
the
sofa
we
fetch
him
out
we
fetch
him
out
said
volodin
with
a
snigger
and
went
into
the
parlour
somehow
they
managed
to
drag
out
the
cat
from
under
the
sofa
and
took
the
rattles
off
his
tail
peredonov
found
some
thistle
heads
and
began
to
stick
them
into
the
cat
fur
the
cat
spat
violently
and
ran
into
the
kitchen
peredonov
tired
of
his
messing
about
with
the
cat
sat
down
in
his
usual
position
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
his
fingers
interlaced
his
legs
crossed
his
face
motionless
and
morose
peredonov
kept
the
princess
second
letter
more
zealously
than
the
first
he
always
carried
it
about
with
him
in
his
wallet
and
showed
it
to
everyone
looking
mysterious
as
he
did
so
he
looked
vigilantly
to
see
that
no
one
took
the
letter
away
from
him
he
did
not
give
it
into
anyone
hands
and
after
each
showing
he
put
it
away
in
his
wallet
which
he
put
into
the
of
his
buttoned
up
his
coat
and
looked
gravely
and
significantly
at
his
companions
why
do
you
hide
it
away
like
that
routilov
once
asked
him
laughingly
as
a
precaution
said
peredonov
morosely
who
can
tell
you
might
take
it
from
me
it
be
a
case
for
siberia
said
routilov
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
slapping
peredonov
on
the
back
but
peredonov
preserved
an
imperturbable
dignity
in
general
he
had
lately
been
assuming
an
air
of
greater
importance
he
often
boasted
i
be
an
inspector
you
will
go
sour
here
but
i
shall
have
two
districts
to
begin
with
and
then
perhaps
three
oh
ho
ho
he
was
quite
convinced
that
he
would
receive
his
inspector
position
very
soon
more
than
once
he
said
to
the
schoolmaster
falastov
i
get
you
too
out
of
here
old
chap
and
the
schoolmaster
falastov
was
more
respectful
in
his
bearing
to
peredonov
koukish
a
clenched
fist
with
the
thumb
thrust
between
the
first
and
second
fingers
this
gesture
is
a
great
insult
in
russia
to
make
it
is
as
much
as
to
say
a
fig
for
you
a
russian
popular
dance
sosna
means
pine
and
so
sna
from
sleep
peredonov
puns
on
it
variation
on
the
pun
sonya
is
another
form
of
sofya
rough
shoes
worn
by
the
peasants
russians
eat
dried
sunflower
seeds
as
americans
eat
peanuts
chapter
xxii
peredonov
began
to
attend
church
frequently
he
always
stood
in
a
conspicuous
place
at
one
time
he
crossed
himself
more
often
than
was
necessary
at
another
he
stood
like
a
person
in
a
trance
and
looked
stupidly
before
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
spies
were
hiding
behind
the
columns
and
were
peeping
out
from
there
trying
to
make
him
laugh
but
he
did
not
yield
laughter
the
quiet
faint
laughter
the
giggling
and
the
whispering
of
the
routilov
girls
sounded
in
peredonov
ears
and
grew
at
times
to
an
extraordinary
pitch
as
if
the
cunning
girls
were
laughing
straight
into
his
ears
to
make
him
laugh
and
to
disgrace
him
but
peredonov
did
not
yield
at
times
a
bluish
nedotikomka
appeared
among
the
clouds
of
incense
smoke
its
eyes
gleamed
like
little
fires
with
a
slight
rustle
it
lifted
itself
into
the
air
though
not
for
long
but
for
the
most
part
it
rolled
itself
at
the
feet
of
members
of
the
congregation
it
jeered
at
peredonov
and
tormented
him
obtrusively
of
course
it
wanted
to
frighten
him
so
that
he
would
leave
the
church
before
mass
was
over
but
he
understood
its
cunning
design
and
he
did
not
yield
the
church
service
so
dear
to
many
people
not
in
its
words
and
ceremonies
but
in
its
innermost
appeal
was
incomprehensible
to
peredonov
that
is
why
it
frightened
him
the
swinging
of
the
censers
frightened
him
as
if
it
had
been
a
mysterious
incantation
what
he
swinging
it
so
hard
for
he
thought
the
vestments
of
those
serving
the
mass
seemed
to
him
coarse
rags
and
when
he
looked
at
the
array
of
priests
he
felt
malignant
and
he
wanted
to
tear
the
vestments
and
break
the
sacred
vessels
the
church
ceremonies
and
mysteries
seemed
to
him
an
evil
witchcraft
intended
to
subject
the
common
people
he
crumbled
the
wafer
into
the
communion
cup
he
thought
angrily
of
the
priest
it
cheap
wine
they
deceive
the
people
to
get
more
money
for
their
church
celebrations
the
mystery
of
the
eternal
transformation
of
inert
matter
into
a
force
breaking
the
fetters
of
death
was
for
ever
hidden
from
him
a
walking
corpse
the
absurd
mingling
of
unbelief
in
a
living
god
and
his
messiah
with
his
absurd
belief
in
sorcery
the
people
were
leaving
the
church
the
village
schoolmaster
machigin
a
simple
young
man
was
standing
near
the
girls
smiling
and
conversing
freely
with
them
peredonov
thought
that
it
was
not
quite
becoming
for
him
to
conduct
himself
so
freely
before
the
future
inspector
machigin
wore
a
straw
hat
but
peredonov
remembered
that
in
the
summer
he
had
seen
him
just
outside
the
town
wearing
an
official
cap
with
a
badge
peredonov
decided
to
complain
about
it
as
it
happened
inspector
bogdanov
was
also
present
peredonov
walked
up
to
him
and
said
your
machigin
has
been
wearing
a
cap
with
a
badge
he
trying
to
look
like
a
gentleman
bogdanov
was
alarmed
trembled
and
his
grey
adam
apple
quivered
he
has
no
right
no
right
whatever
he
exclaimed
anxiously
blinking
his
eyes
he
has
no
right
but
he
been
wearing
it
complained
peredonov
he
ought
to
be
stopped
i
told
you
that
long
ago
or
else
any
boor
of
a
muzhik
can
wear
a
badge
and
what
will
come
of
it
bogdanov
who
had
been
frightened
by
peredonov
before
was
even
more
alarmed
how
does
he
dare
eh
he
wailed
i
will
call
him
up
at
once
at
once
and
i
reprimand
him
most
severely
he
left
peredonov
and
quickly
ran
off
home
volodin
walked
at
peredonov
side
and
said
in
a
reproachful
bleating
voice
he
wearing
a
badge
what
do
you
think
of
that
as
if
he
had
an
official
rank
why
is
it
allowed
you
must
wear
a
badge
either
said
peredonov
i
must
and
i
do
want
to
said
volodin
still
i
sometimes
put
on
a
badge
only
i
know
where
and
when
one
can
do
it
i
go
out
of
the
town
and
i
put
it
on
there
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
and
there
no
one
to
stop
me
and
when
you
meet
a
muzhik
you
get
more
respect
a
badge
does
become
your
mug
pavloushka
said
peredonov
and
keep
farther
off
you
making
me
dusty
with
your
hoofs
volodin
relapsed
into
an
injured
silence
but
still
walked
beside
him
peredonov
said
in
a
preoccupied
way
the
routilov
girls
ought
to
be
informed
against
too
they
only
go
to
church
to
chatter
and
to
laugh
they
rouge
themselves
they
dress
themselves
up
and
then
go
to
church
and
then
they
steal
incense
to
make
scents
of
that
why
they
have
such
a
strong
smell
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
volodin
shaking
his
head
with
his
bulging
dull
eyes
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
ran
quickly
over
the
ground
and
brought
a
feeling
of
dread
on
peredonov
sometimes
the
grey
nedotikomka
glimmered
in
the
clouds
of
dust
whenever
the
grass
stirred
in
the
wind
peredonov
saw
the
nedotikomka
running
through
it
feeding
on
the
grass
why
is
there
grass
in
the
town
he
thought
what
neglect
it
ought
to
be
rooted
out
a
twig
stirred
in
the
tree
it
rolled
up
cawed
and
flew
away
in
the
distance
peredonov
shivered
gave
a
wild
cry
and
ran
off
home
volodin
ran
after
him
anxiously
and
with
a
perplexed
expression
in
his
bulging
eyes
clutched
at
his
bowler
hat
and
swung
his
stick
that
same
day
bogdanov
asked
machigin
to
come
and
see
him
before
entering
the
inspector
house
machigin
stood
in
the
street
with
his
back
to
the
sun
took
off
his
hat
and
combed
his
hair
with
his
fingers
noticing
from
his
shadow
that
his
hair
was
unkempt
explain
yourself
young
man
what
are
you
thinking
of
eh
bogdanov
assailed
machigin
with
these
words
what
is
the
matter
asked
machigin
unconcernedly
playing
with
his
straw
hat
and
swinging
his
left
foot
bogdanov
did
not
ask
him
to
sit
down
as
he
intended
to
reprimand
him
how
is
it
young
man
how
is
it
that
you
been
wearing
a
badge
eh
what
made
you
infringe
the
rule
he
asked
assuming
an
expression
of
sternness
and
shaking
his
adam
apple
machigin
flushed
but
answered
boldly
what
of
it
have
i
a
right
to
are
you
an
official
eh
an
official
said
bogdanov
excitedly
what
sort
of
an
official
are
you
eh
a
copying
clerk
eh
it
a
sign
of
a
schoolmaster
calling
said
machigin
boldly
and
suddenly
smiled
as
he
called
to
mind
what
the
dignity
of
a
schoolmaster
vocation
was
carry
a
stick
in
your
hand
a
stick
that
the
sign
of
your
schoolmaster
calling
said
bogdanov
shaking
his
head
but
please
sergey
potapitch
said
machigin
in
an
injured
tone
what
the
good
of
a
stick
anyone
can
do
that
but
a
badge
gives
a
man
prestige
what
sort
of
prestige
eh
what
sort
of
prestige
bogdanov
shouted
at
him
what
sort
of
prestige
do
you
want
eh
are
you
an
official
oh
but
forgive
me
sergey
potapitch
said
machigin
persuasively
and
reasonably
among
the
ignorant
peasant
classes
a
badge
immediately
arouses
a
feeling
of
respect
they
been
much
more
respectful
lately
machigin
stroked
his
red
moustache
in
a
way
it
ca
be
allowed
young
man
it
ca
be
allowed
under
any
consideration
said
bogdanov
shaking
his
head
stiffly
but
please
sergey
potapitch
a
schoolmaster
without
a
badge
is
like
the
british
lion
without
a
tail
protested
machigin
he
only
a
caricature
what
a
tail
got
to
do
with
it
eh
why
drag
in
the
tail
eh
said
bogdanov
excitedly
why
are
you
mixing
it
up
with
polities
eh
what
business
is
it
of
yours
to
discuss
politics
eh
no
young
man
better
dispense
with
the
badge
for
heaven
sake
give
it
up
no
impossible
how
could
it
be
possible
god
preserve
us
we
ca
tell
who
might
find
it
out
machigin
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
was
about
to
say
something
else
but
bogdanov
interrupted
him
what
bogdanov
considered
a
brilliant
idea
flashed
into
his
head
but
you
came
to
me
without
the
badge
without
the
badge
eh
you
yourself
feel
that
it
not
the
right
thing
to
do
machigin
was
nonplussed
for
a
moment
but
found
an
answer
even
to
this
as
we
are
rural
schoolmasters
we
need
this
privilege
in
the
country
but
in
town
we
are
known
to
belong
to
the
intellectual
classes
no
young
man
you
know
very
well
that
this
is
not
allowed
and
if
i
hear
of
it
again
we
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
you
from
time
to
time
grushina
arranged
evening
parties
for
young
people
from
among
whom
she
hoped
to
find
another
husband
to
conceal
her
purpose
she
also
invited
married
people
the
guests
came
early
to
one
of
these
parties
pictures
covered
in
thick
muslin
hung
on
the
walls
of
there
was
really
nothing
indecent
in
them
when
grushina
with
an
arch
wanton
smile
raised
these
curtains
the
guests
gazed
at
figures
of
naked
women
why
is
this
woman
so
crooked
asked
peredonov
morosely
she
not
crooked
at
all
grushina
defended
the
picture
warmly
she
only
bending
over
she
is
crooked
repeated
peredonov
and
her
eyes
are
not
the
same
like
yours
much
you
understand
about
it
said
grushina
offendedly
these
pictures
are
very
good
and
very
expensive
artists
always
prefer
such
models
peredonov
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
he
recalled
the
advice
he
had
given
vladya
a
few
days
ago
what
are
you
neighing
at
asked
grushina
nartanovitch
the
schoolboy
is
going
to
singe
marta
dress
i
advised
him
to
he
explained
let
him
just
do
it
he
not
such
a
fool
said
grushina
of
course
he
do
it
said
peredonov
confidently
brothers
always
quarrel
with
their
sisters
when
i
was
a
kid
i
always
played
tricks
on
my
sisters
i
pummelled
the
little
ones
and
i
used
to
spoil
the
older
ones
clothes
everyone
does
said
routilov
i
do
quarrel
with
my
sisters
well
what
do
you
do
kiss
them
asked
peredonov
you
are
a
swine
and
a
scoundrel
ardalyon
borisitch
i
give
you
a
black
eye
said
routilov
calmly
i
do
like
such
jokes
said
peredonov
and
moved
away
from
routilov
yes
thought
peredonov
he
might
really
do
it
he
got
such
a
mean
face
she
has
only
one
dress
a
black
one
he
went
on
referring
to
marta
vershina
will
make
her
a
new
one
said
varvara
with
spiteful
envy
she
make
all
her
dowry
for
her
she
such
a
beauty
that
even
the
horses
are
frightened
she
grumbled
on
quietly
looking
maliciously
at
mourin
it
time
for
you
to
marry
too
said
prepolovenskaya
what
are
you
waiting
for
ardalyon
borisitch
the
prepolovenskys
already
saw
that
after
the
second
letter
peredonov
was
determined
to
marry
varvara
they
also
believed
in
the
letter
they
began
to
say
that
they
had
always
been
on
varvara
side
there
was
no
good
in
their
quarrelling
with
peredonov
it
was
profitable
to
play
cards
with
him
as
for
genya
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
wait
they
would
have
to
look
for
another
husband
of
course
you
ought
to
marry
said
prepolovensky
it
will
be
a
good
thing
in
itself
and
you
please
the
princess
the
princess
will
be
pleased
that
you
married
and
so
you
will
please
her
and
you
do
a
good
thing
yes
a
good
thing
and
yes
really
you
be
doing
a
good
thing
and
you
please
the
princess
yes
and
i
say
the
same
thing
said
prepolovenskaya
but
prepolovensky
was
unable
to
stop
and
seeing
that
everyone
was
walking
away
from
him
he
sat
down
beside
a
young
official
and
began
to
explain
the
same
thing
to
him
i
decided
to
get
married
said
peredonov
only
varvara
and
i
do
know
how
to
do
it
i
really
do
know
how
to
go
about
it
it
not
such
a
difficult
business
said
prepolovenskaya
now
if
you
like
my
husband
and
i
will
arrange
everything
you
just
sit
still
and
do
think
about
anything
very
well
said
peredonov
i
agreeable
only
everything
must
be
done
well
and
in
proper
style
i
do
mind
what
it
costs
everything
will
be
quite
all
right
do
worry
about
that
prepolovenskaya
assured
him
peredonov
continued
to
state
his
conditions
other
people
through
stinginess
buy
thin
wedding
rings
or
silver
ones
gilt
over
but
i
do
want
to
do
that
i
want
pure
gold
ones
and
i
even
prefer
wedding
bracelets
to
wedding
rings
they
are
more
expensive
and
more
dignified
everyone
laughed
bracelets
are
impossible
said
prepolovenskaya
smiling
slightly
you
must
have
rings
why
impossible
asked
peredonov
in
vexation
simply
because
it
not
done
but
perhaps
it
is
done
said
peredonov
increduously
i
will
ask
the
priest
he
knows
best
routilov
advised
him
with
a
snigger
you
better
order
wedding
belts
ardalyon
borisitch
i
have
got
money
enough
for
that
said
peredonov
not
noticing
the
smiles
i
not
a
banker
only
the
other
day
i
dreamed
that
i
was
being
married
and
that
i
wore
a
velvet
and
that
varvara
and
i
had
gold
bracelets
and
behind
us
were
two
holding
the
crowns
over
us
singing
i
also
had
an
interesting
dream
last
night
announced
volodin
but
i
do
know
what
it
can
mean
i
was
sitting
as
it
were
on
a
gold
throne
with
a
gold
crown
on
and
there
was
grass
in
front
of
me
and
on
the
grass
were
little
sheep
all
little
sheep
all
little
sheep
and
the
little
sheep
walked
about
and
moved
their
heads
like
this
and
kept
on
their
volodin
walked
up
and
down
the
room
shaking
his
head
protruded
his
lips
and
bleated
the
guests
laughed
volodin
sat
down
on
a
chair
with
an
expression
of
bliss
on
his
face
looked
at
them
with
his
bulging
eyes
and
laughed
with
the
same
bleating
laughter
what
happened
then
asked
grushina
winking
at
the
others
well
it
was
all
little
sheep
and
little
sheep
and
then
i
woke
up
concluded
volodin
a
sheep
has
sheepish
dreams
growled
peredonov
it
is
such
great
shakes
being
tsar
of
the
sheep
i
also
had
a
dream
said
varvara
with
an
impudent
smile
only
i
ca
tell
it
before
men
i
tell
it
to
you
alone
ah
my
dear
varvara
dmitrievna
it
strange
i
had
one
too
sniggered
grushina
winking
at
the
others
please
tell
us
we
modest
men
like
the
ladies
said
routilov
the
other
men
also
besought
varvara
and
grushina
to
tell
them
their
dreams
but
the
pair
only
exchanged
glances
laughed
meaningly
and
would
not
tell
they
sat
down
to
play
cards
routilov
assured
everyone
that
peredonov
played
cards
well
peredonov
believed
him
but
that
evening
he
lost
as
usual
routilov
was
winning
this
elated
him
and
he
talked
more
animatedly
than
usual
the
nedotikomka
mocked
at
peredonov
it
was
hiding
somewhere
near
by
it
would
show
itself
sometimes
peering
out
from
behind
the
table
or
from
behind
someone
back
and
then
hide
again
it
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
he
felt
dismayed
the
very
appearance
of
the
cards
dismayed
him
he
saw
two
queens
in
the
place
of
one
and
where
the
third
thought
peredonov
he
dully
examined
the
queen
of
spades
then
turned
it
round
to
see
if
the
third
queen
was
hiding
on
the
back
routilov
said
ardalyon
borisitch
is
looking
behind
the
shirt
they
all
laughed
in
the
meantime
two
young
police
officials
sat
down
to
play
they
played
their
hands
very
quickly
the
winner
laughed
with
joy
and
made
a
long
nose
at
the
other
the
loser
growled
there
was
a
smell
of
food
grushina
called
the
guests
into
the
they
all
went
jostling
each
other
and
with
an
affected
politeness
somehow
they
managed
to
seat
themselves
help
yourselves
everyone
said
grushina
hospitably
now
then
my
dears
stuff
without
fears
to
your
very
ears
eat
the
cake
for
the
hostess
sake
shouted
mourin
gleefully
he
felt
very
gay
looking
at
the
vodka
and
thinking
about
his
winnings
volodin
and
the
two
young
officials
helped
themselves
more
lavishly
than
anyone
else
they
picked
out
the
choicest
and
most
expensive
things
and
ate
caviare
greedily
grushina
said
with
a
forced
laugh
pavel
ivanitch
is
drunk
but
still
knows
the
difference
between
bread
and
cake
as
if
she
had
bought
the
caviare
for
him
and
under
the
pretext
of
serving
the
ladies
she
took
the
best
dishes
away
from
him
but
volodin
was
not
disconcerted
and
was
glad
to
take
what
was
left
he
had
managed
to
eat
a
good
deal
of
the
best
things
and
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
now
peredonov
looked
at
the
munchers
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
everyone
was
laughing
at
him
why
for
what
reason
he
ate
piggishly
and
greedily
everything
that
came
to
his
hand
after
supper
they
sat
down
to
play
cards
again
but
peredonov
soon
got
tired
of
it
he
threw
down
the
cards
and
said
to
the
devil
with
you
i
have
no
luck
i
tired
varvara
let
go
home
and
the
other
guests
got
up
at
the
same
time
volodin
saw
in
the
hall
that
peredonov
had
a
new
stick
he
smiled
and
turned
the
stick
over
in
front
of
him
asking
ardasha
why
are
these
fingers
bent
into
a
little
roll
what
does
it
mean
peredonov
angrily
took
the
stick
from
him
and
put
the
handle
with
a
koukish
carved
out
of
black
wood
on
it
to
volodin
nose
and
said
a
fig
with
butter
for
you
volodin
looked
offended
allow
me
to
say
ardalyon
borisitch
he
said
that
i
eat
bread
with
butter
but
that
i
do
not
want
to
eat
a
fig
with
butter
peredonov
without
listening
to
him
was
solicitously
wrapping
up
his
neck
in
a
scarf
and
buttoning
up
his
overcoat
routilov
said
with
a
laugh
why
are
you
wrapping
yourself
up
ardalyon
borisitch
it
quite
warm
health
before
everything
replied
peredonov
it
was
quiet
in
the
street
the
street
was
stretched
out
in
the
darkness
as
if
asleep
and
snored
gently
it
was
dark
melancholy
and
damp
heavy
clouds
moved
across
the
sky
peredonov
growled
they
let
loose
the
darkness
why
he
was
not
afraid
now
he
was
walking
with
varvara
and
not
alone
soon
a
small
rapid
continuous
rain
began
to
fall
everything
was
still
and
only
the
rain
babbled
something
obtrusively
and
quickly
sobbing
out
incoherent
melancholy
phrases
peredonov
felt
in
nature
the
reflection
of
his
own
dejection
his
own
dread
before
the
mask
of
her
hostility
to
him
he
had
no
conception
of
that
inner
life
in
all
nature
which
is
inaccessible
to
external
decrees
the
life
which
alone
creates
the
true
deep
and

relations
between
man
and

because
all
nature
seemed
to
him
permeated
with
petty
human
feelings
blinded
by
the
illusions
of
personality
and
distinct
existence
he
could
not
understand
elemental
dionysian
exultations
rejoicing
and

pitiful

the
prepolovenskys
undertook
the
arrangement
of
the
wedding
it
was
decided
that
they
should
be
married
in
a
village
six
versts
from
the
town
varvara
felt
uneasy
about
marrying
in
the
town
after
they
had
lived
together
so
many
years
as
relatives
the
day
fixed
for
the
wedding
was
concealed
the
prepolovenskys
spread
a
rumour
that
it
was
to
take
place
on
friday
but
it
was
really
to
be
on
wednesday
they
did
it
to
prevent
curiosity
seekers
from
coming
to
the
wedding
varvara
more
than
once
said
to
peredonov
ardalyon
borisitch
do
you
say
a
word
of
when
the
wedding
is
to
be
or
they
might
hinder
us
peredonov
gave
the
expenses
for
the
wedding
unwillingly
and
with
humiliations
for
varvara
sometimes
he
brought
his
stick
with
the
koukish
head
and
said
to
varvara
kiss
the
koukish
and
i
give
you
the
money
if
you
do
i
wo
varvara
kissed
the
koukish
what
of
that
it
wo
split
my
lips
she
said
the
date
of
the
wedding
was
kept
secret
even
from
the
until
the
day
itself
so
that
they
might
not
chatter
about
it
at
first
routilov
and
volodin
were
invited
as
and
both
eagerly
accepted
routilov
looked
for
an
amusing
experience
while
volodin
felt
flattered
to
play
such
an
important
role
at
such
a
distinguished
event
in
the
life
of
such
an
esteemed
personage
then
peredonov
considered
that
one
was
not
enough
for
him
he
said
varvara
you
can
have
one
but
i
must
have
two
one
is
enough
for
me
it
will
be
difficult
to
hold
the
crown
over
me
i
a
tall
man
and
peredonov
invited
falastov
as
his
second
varvara
grumbled
to
the
devil
with
him
we
got
two
why
should
we
have
any
more
he
got
gold
spectacles
he
look
important
said
peredonov
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
peredonov
washed
in
hot
water
as
he
always
did
to
avoid
catching
cold
and
then
demanded
rouge
explaining
now
i
have
to
rouge
myself
every
day
or
else
they
think
i
getting
old
and
they
wo
appoint
me
as
inspector
varvara
disliked
giving
him
any
of
her
rouge
but
she
had
to
yield
and
peredonov
coloured
his
cheeks
he
muttered
veriga
himself
paints
so
as
to
look
younger
you
do
expect
me
to
get
married
with
white
cheeks
then
shutting
himself
in
his
bedroom
he
decided
to
mark
himself
so
that
volodin
could
not
change
places
with
him
on
his
chest
on
his
stomach
on
his
forearms
and
in
various
other
places
he
marked
in
ink
the
letter
p
volodin
ought
to
be
marked
too
but
how
can
he
be
he
would
see
it
and
rub
it
off
thought
peredonov
dejectedly
then
a
new
thought
came
into
his
mind
to
put
on
a
pair
of
corsets
so
that
he
should
not
be
taken
for
an
old
man
if
he
happened
to
bend
over
he
asked
varvara
for
a
pair
of
corsets
but
varvara
corsets
proved
to
be
too
tight
they
would
not
come
together
they
ought
to
have
been
bought
earlier
he
said
savagely
you
never
think
of
anything
in
time
what
man
wears
corsets
said
varvara
no
one
does
veriga
does
said
peredonov
yes
veriga
is
an
old
man
but
you
ardalyon
borisitch
thank
god
are
in
your
prime
peredonov
smiled
with
looked
in
the
mirror
and
said
of
course
i
shall
live
another
hundred
and
fifty
years
the
cat
sneezed
under
the
bed
varvara
said
with
a
smile
there
even
the
cat
sneezing
that
shows
it
true
but
peredonov
suddenly
frowned
the
cat
now
aroused
dread
in
him
and
its
sneezing
seemed
to
him
a
sign
of
ominous
cunning
he
sneeze
something
that
not
wanted
he
thought
and
got
under
the
bed
and
began
to
drive
the
cat
out
the
cat
mewed
savagely
pressed
against
the
wall
and
suddenly
with
a
loud
piercing
mew
jumped
between
peredonov
hands
and
ran
out
of
the
room
a
dutch
devil
peredonov
abused
the
animal
savagely
he
certainly
a
devil
affirmed
varvara
he
become
altogether
wild
he
wo
let
himself
be
stroked
as
if
the
devil
had
got
into
him
the
prepolovenskys
sent
for
the
early
in
the
morning
at
ten
all
had
gathered
at
peredonov
grushina
also
came
and
sofya
with
her
husband
they
were
handed
vodka
and
the
usual
peredonov
ate
little
and
thought
dejectedly
as
to
how
he
could
distinguish
himself
from
volodin
he
curled
like
a
sheep
he
thought
maliciously
and
suddenly
imagined
that
he
too
might
comb
his
hair
in
a
special
way
he
rose
from
the
table
and
said
you
go
on
eating
and
drinking
i
do
object
but
i
go
to
the
hairdresser
and
i
have
my
hair
done
in
the
spanish
style
what
is
the
spanish
style
asked
routilov
wait
and
you
see
when
peredonov
went
to
get
his
hair
trimmed
varvara
said
he
always
inventing
new
notions
he
sees
devils
if
he
only
drank
less
gin
the
cursed
tippler
prepolovenskaya
said
with
a
sly
smile
well
as
soon
as
you
are
married
ardalyon
borisitch
will
get
his
place
and
settle
down
grushina
sniggered
she
was
amused
by
the
secrecy
of
this
wedding
and
she
was
excited
by
an
intense
desire
to
create
an
ignominious
spectacle
of
some
sort
and
yet
not
be
mixed
up
with
it
on
the
day
before
she
had
whispered
in
an
underhand
way
to
her
friends
the
place
and
hour
of
the
wedding
and
early
that
morning
she
had
called
in
the
younger
son
had
given
him
a
piece
and
hinted
to
him
that
towards
evening
he
should
wait
outside
the
town
where
the
newly
married
couple
would
pass
to
throw
rubbish
at
them
the
boy
gladly
agreed
and
gave
his
sworn
promise
not
to
betray
her
grushina
reminded
him
you
did
give
away
cherepnin
when
they
beat
you
we
were
fools
said
the
boy
now
let
hang
us
and
we
wo
tell
and
the
boy
in
confirmation
of
his
oath
ate
a
small
handful
of
loam
for
this
grushina
added
another
three
kopecks
at
the
hairdresser
peredonov
demanded
the
barber
himself
the
barber
a
young
man
who
had
lately
finished
a
course
at
the
town
school
and
who
had
read
books
from
the
rural
library
was
just
finishing
cutting
the
hair
of
a
landed
proprietor
when
he
had
finished
he
came
up
to
peredonov
let
him
go
first
said
peredonov
angrily
the
man
paid
and
left
peredonov
sat
down
in
front
of
the
mirror
i
want
my
hair
trimmed
and
properly
arranged
said
he
i
have
an
important
affair
on
something
special
and
so
i
want
my
hair
arranged
in
the
spanish
style
the
boy
apprentice
who
stood
at
the
door
snorted
with
amusement
his
master
looked
sternly
at
him
he
had
never
had
occasion
to
trim
anyone
hair
in
spanish
style
and
did
not
know
what
the
spanish
style
was
or
even
if
there
were
such
a
style
but
if
the
gentleman
demanded
such
a
thing
then
it
must
be
assumed
that
he
knew
what
he
wanted
the
young
hairdresser
did
not
want
to
betray
his
ignorance
he
said
respectfully
it
impossible
to
do
it
with
your
hair
sir
why
impossible
said
peredonov
taken
aback
your
hair
is
badly
nourished
explained
the
hairdresser
do
you
expect
me
to
pour
beer
over
it
growled
peredonov
excuse
me
why
beer
said
the
hairdresser
affably
when
your
hair
is
trimmed
your
head
shows
signs
of
baldness
and
what
left
is
enough
to
do
the
thing
in
the
spanish
style
peredonov
felt
himself
crushed
by
the
impossibility
of
having
his
hair
trimmed
in
the
spanish
style
he
said
dejectedly
well
cut
it
as
you
like
he
began
to
wonder
whether
the
hairdresser
had
been
persuaded
not
to
cut
his
hair
in
a
distinguished
style
he
ought
not
to
have
spoken
about
it
at
home
evidently
while
he
was
walking
gravely
and
sedately
along
the
street
volodin
had
run
like
a
little
sheep
by
back
streets
and
had
conspired
with
the
hairdresser
would
you
like
a
spray
sir
said
the
hairdresser
having
finished
trimming
his
hair
spray
me
with
mignonette
the
more
the
better
demanded
peredonov
you
might
at
least
make
up
by
spraying
me
with
plenty
of
mignonette
i
sorry
but
we
do
keep
mignonette
said
the
hairdresser
in
confusion
how
will
opopanax
do
you
ca
do
anything
i
want
said
peredonov
bitterly
go
ahead
and
spray
me
with
whatever
you
got
he
returned
home
in
vexation
it
was
a
windy
day
the
gates
kept
banging
yawning
and
laughing
in
the
wind
peredonov
looked
at
them
dispiritedly
how
could
he
face
the
drive
but
everything
arranged
itself
three
carriages
were
waiting
they
had
to
sit
down
and
drive
away
at
once
in
order
not
to
attract
attention
many
curiosity
mongers
might
collect
and
follow
them
to
the
wedding
if
the
carriages
waited
about
too
long
they
took
their
places
and
drove
off
peredonov
with
varvara
the
prepolovenskys
with
routilov
grushina
with
the
other
a
cloud
of
dust
rose
in
the
square
peredonov
heard
a
noise
of
axes
barely
visible
through
the
dust
a
wooden
wall
loomed
and
grew
they
were
building
a
fortress
muzhiks
savage
and
glimmered
in
their
red
shirts
through
the
dust
the
carriages
ran
past
the
terrible
vision
flashed
by
and
vanished
peredonov
looked
around
in
terror
but
nothing
was
visible
and
he
could
not
decide
to
tell
anyone
about
his
vision
a
sadness
tormented
peredonov
the
whole
way
everything
looked
hostilely
at
him
the
wind
blew
ominously
the
sky
was
black
the
wind
was
in
their
faces
and
seemed
to
moan
for
something
the
trees
gave
no
shadow
they
kept
their
shadows
within
themselves
but
the
dust
rose
a
long
grey
serpent
the
sun
hid
behind
the
clouds
did
it
look
out
from
under
them
the
road
was
undulating
unexpected
bushes
copses
and
fields
rose
from
behind
low
hillocks
and
streams
appeared
under
the
wooden
arched
bridges
the
flew
by
said
peredonov
morosely
looking
into
the
whitish
misty
distance
of
the
sky
one
eye
and
two
wings
and
nothing
more
varvara
smiled
she
thought
that
peredonov
had
been
drunk
since
the
morning
but
she
did
not
argue
with
him
for
she
thought
he
might
get
angry
and
refuse
to
go
to
the
wedding
all
four
of
routilov
sisters
were
already
in
a
corner
of
the
church
hiding
behind
a
column
peredonov
did
not
see
them
at
first
but
later
during
the
ceremony
when
they
appeared
from
their
ambush
and
came
forward
he
saw
them
and
felt
frightened
they
actually
did
not
do
anything
unpleasant
they
did
not
demand
as
he
had
been
afraid
at
first
that
he
should
chase
varvara
away
and
take
one
of
them
they
only
kept
laughing
all
the
time
and
their
laughter
quiet
at
first
resounded
louder
and
more
evil
in
his
ears
all
the
time
like
the
laughter
of
untameable
furies
there
were
practically
no
outsiders
in
the
church
only
two
or
three
old
women
came
from
somewhere
or
other
and
this
was
fortunate
for
peredonov
conducted
himself
curiously
and
stupidly
he
yawned
mumbled
nudged
varvara
complained
about
the
smell
of
incense
wax
and
muzhiks
your
sisters
are
always
laughing
he
grumbled
turning
to
routilov
they
perforate
their
livers
with
laughing
besides
that
the
nedotikomka
disturbed
him
it
was
dirty
and
dusty
and
kept
hiding
under
the
priest
vestments
both
varvara
and
grushina
thought
the
church
ceremonies
amusing
they
giggled
continuously
the
words
about
a
woman
cleaving
to
her
husband
evoked
special
merriment
routilov
also
giggled
he
considered
it
his
duty
always
and
everywhere
to
amuse
the
ladies
volodin
conducted
himself
sedately
and
crossed
himself
preserving
an
expression
of
profundity
on
his
face
the
church
ceremonies
did
not
suggest
to
his
mind
anything
but
that
they
were
an
established
custom
which
ought
to
be
fulfilled
and
that
the
fulfilment
of
all
ceremonies
leads
one
to
a
certain
inner
convenience
he
went
to
church
on
sundays
and
he
prayed
and
was
absolved
he
had
sinned
and
repented
and
again
he
was
absolved
now
this
is
excellent
and
convenient
all
the
more
convenient
because
once
outside
the
church
he
did
not
have
to
think
about
churchly
matters
but
was
guided
entirely
by
quite
different
and
worldly
rules
the
ceremony
was
barely
over
and
they
had
not
yet
had
time
to
leave
the
church
when
suddenly
a
drunken
crowd
tumbled
noisily
into
the
church
it
was
mourin
and
his
friends
mourin
dusty
and
tousled
as
usual
embraced
peredonov
and
shouted
you
ca
hide
it
from
us
old
boy
we
such
fast
friends
that
you
ca
part
us
by
pouring
cold
water
on
us
and
yet
you
hid
it
from
us
you
tricky
fellow
exclamations
came
from
all
sides
villain
you
did
invite
us
but
we
here
all
the
same
yes
we
found
it
out
without
you
the
embraced
and
congratulated
peredonov
mourin
said
we
missed
the
way
because
we
stopped
for
a
drink
or
else
we
have
conferred
the
pleasure
of
our
company
on
you
earlier
peredonov
looked
at
them
gloomily
and
did
not
reply
to
their
congratulations
malevolence
and
fear
tormented
him
they
always
tracking
me
everywhere
he
thought
dejectedly
you
might
have
crossed
your
foreheads
he
said
angrily
or
possibly
you
were
thinking
evil
against
me
the
visitors
crossed
themselves
laughed
and
joked
the
young
officials
especially
distinguished
themselves
the
deacon
reproached
them
among
the
visitors
was
a
young
men
with
red
moustaches
whom
peredonov
did
not
even
know
he
resembled
a
cat
to
an
extraordinary
degree
was
it
their
cat
turned
into
human
shape
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
this
young
man
kept
snarling
he
had
not
forgotten
his
cattish
habits
who
told
you
asked
varvara
angrily
of
the
new
guests
a
nice
young
woman
told
us
replied
mourin
but
we
have
forgotten
who
it
was
grushina
turned
around
and
winked
at
them
the
new
guests
smiled
back
but
did
not
give
her
away
mourin
said
as
you
like
ardalyon
borisitch
but
we
coming
with
you
and
you
must
give
us
champagne
do
be
a
skinflint
you
ca
pour
cold
water
on
such
friends
as
we
are
and
yet
you
tried
to
get
married
on
the
quiet
when
the
peredonovs
returned
from
the
wedding
the
sun
had
gone
down
but
the
sky
was
all
fiery
and
golden
but
this
did
not
please
peredonov
he
growled
they
dabbed
pieces
of
gold
on
the
sky
and
they
falling
off
who
ever
saw
such
a
waste
the
locksmith
sons
met
them
just
outside
the
town
in
a
crowd
of
other
street
boys
they
ran
alongside
and
hooted
peredonov
trembled
with
fear
varvara
uttered
curses
spat
at
the
boys
and
showed
them
the
koukish
the
guests
and
the
roared
with
laughter
at
last
they
reached
home
the
entire
company
tumbled
into
house
with
a
shout
a
hubbub
and
whistling
they
drank
champagne
then
took
to
vodka
and
began
to
play
cards
they
kept
on
drinking
all
night
varvara
got
tipsy
danced
and
was
happy
peredonov
was
also
happy
volodin
had
not
yet
been
substituted
for
him
as
always
the
visitors
conducted
themselves
disrespectfully
and
indecently
towards
varvara
this
seemed
to
her
to
be
in
the
order
of
things
after
the
wedding
the
peredonovs
existence
changed
very
little
only
varvara
attitude
towards
her
husband
became
more
assured
and
independent
she
ran
about
less
for
her
husband
but
through
habit
she
was
still
a
little
afraid
of
him
peredonov
also
from
habit
shouted
at
her
as
he
used
to
do
and
sometimes
even
beat
her
but
he
too
scented
the
assurance
she
had
acquired
with
her
new
position
and
this
depressed
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
she
was
not
so
afraid
of
him
as
she
had
been
it
was
because
she
had
strengthened
her
criminal
idea
to
leave
him
and
get
volodin
into
his
place
i
must
be
on
my
guard
he
thought
varvara
triumphed
she
together
with
her
husband
paid
visits
to
the
town
ladies
even
to
those
with
whom
she
was
little
acquainted
at
these
visits
she
showed
a
ridiculous
pride
and
awkwardness
she
was
received
everywhere
though
in
many
houses
with
astonishment
varvara
had
ordered
in
good
time
for
these
visits
a
hat
from
the
best
local
modiste
the
large
vivid
flowers
set
abundantly
on
the
hat
delighted
her
the
peredonovs
began
their
visits
with
the
wife
then
they
went
to
the
wife
of
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
on
the
day
that
the
peredonovs
had
prepared
to
make
the
visits
of
which
of
course
the
routilovs
knew
beforehand
the
sisters
went
to
varvara
nikolayevna
khripatch
to
see
out
of
curiosity
how
varvara
peredonov
would
conduct
herself
the
peredonovs
soon
arrived
varvara
made
a
curtsy
to
the
wife
and
in
a
more
than
usually
jarring
voice
said
well
we
come
to
see
you
please
love
us
and
be
kind
to
us
i
very
glad
replied
the
wife
constrainedly
and
she
seated
varvara
on
the
sofa
varvara
sat
down
with
obvious
pleasure
in
the
place
indicated
spread
out
her
rustling
green
dress
and
said
trying
to
appear
at
ease
i
been
a
until
now
but
now
i
become
a
madam
namesakes
i
varvara
and
you
varvara
and
we
not

to
each
other
houses
while
i
was
a
i
sat
at
home
most
of
the
time
what

good
of
sitting
by
one
stove
all
the
time

i
will
live
more
socially

me
a
favour

will
come
to
you
and
you
will

to
us
mossure
to

and
madame
to

but
i
hear
that
you

to

here
long
said
the
wife
i
told
that
you
and
your
husband
are
going
to
be
transferred
yes
the
paper
will
come
soon
and
then
we
shall
leave
here
replied
varvara
but
as
the
paper
has
not
yet
come
we
must
stay
here
a
little
longer
and
show
ourselves
varvara
had
hopes
of
the
inspector
position
after
the
wedding
she
wrote
a
letter
to
the
princess
she
had
not
yet
received
an
answer
she
decided
to
write
again
at
the
new
year
liudmilla
said
but
we
thought
ardalyon
borisitch
that
you
were
going
to
marry
the
young
lady
pilnikov
what
the
good
of
me
marrying
anyone
else
said
peredonov
i
need
patronage
but
how
did
your
affair
with
mademoiselle
pilnikov
get
broken
off
liudmilla
teased
him
did
you
pay
her
attentions
did
she
refuse
you
i
show
her
up
yet
growled
peredonov
morosely
that
an

ardalyon
borisitch

wife

a
dry
laugh

chapter
xxiv
the
peredonov
cat
acted
wildly
snarled
and
refused
to
come
when
called
it
had
become
quite
incorrigible
the
animal
alarmed
peredonov
he
sometimes
pronounced
exorcisms
over
it
i
wonder
whether
it
will
help
he
thought
there
strong
electricity
in
a
cat
fur
that
where
the
trouble
is
once
the
idea
came
into
his
mind
to
have
the
cat
shorn
no
sooner
thought
of
than
done
varvara
was
not
at
home
she
had
gone
to
grushina
after
having
put
a
bottle
of
cherry
brandy
into
her
pocket
there
was
no
one
to
hinder
her
peredonov
tied
the
cat
on
a
cord
he
had
made
a
collar
out
of
a
pocket
handkerchief
and
led
the
animal
to
the
hairdresser
the
cat
mewed
wildly
and
struggled
sometimes
it
threw
itself
in
desperation
at
peredonov
but
peredonov
kept
it
at
a
distance
with
his
stick
a
crowd
of
small
boys
ran
behind
him
hooting
and
laughing
paused
to
look
people
looked
out
of
their
windows
to
see
what
the
noise
was
about
peredonov
morosely
dragged
the
cat
along
on
the
cord
without
the
least
embarrassment
he
succeeded
in
getting
the
cat
to
the
hairdresser
and
said
shave
the
cat
barber
the
closer
the
better
the
small
boys
crowded
at
the
shop
door
roaring
with
laughter
and
making
faces
the
hairdresser
felt
offended
and
grew
red
he
said
in
a
slightly
trembling
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
we
do
undertake
such
jobs
and
who
ever
heard
of
a
shaved
cat
it
must
be
the
very
latest
fashion
which
reached
us
yet
peredonov
listened
to
him
with
stupefied
disappointment
he
shouted
you
better
admit
that
you
ca
do
it
incompetent
and
he
walked
away
dragging
after
him
the
cat
which
mewed
continuously
on
the
way
he
thought
dejectedly
that
everywhere
and
always
everyone
laughed
at
him
and
no
one
wanted
to
help
him
his
sadness
oppressed
his
heart
peredonov
went
with
volodin
and
routilov
to
the
to
play
billiards
the
marker
said
to
them
with
embarrassment
i
sorry
gentlemen
you
ca
play
why
not
asked
peredonov
irritatedly
well
i
sorry
to
say
there
are
no
billiard
balls
replied
the
marker
someone
pinched
them
when
he
was
looking
said
the
sternly
leaning
across
the
counter
the
marker
trembled
and
suddenly
twitched
his
reddened
ears
as
a
hare
does
and
whispered
they
were
stolen
peredonov
exclaimed
in
a
frightened
voice
good
lord
who
stole
them
it
not
known
said
the
marker
no
one
seemed
to
have
been
here
and
then
when
i
went
to
look
for
the
balls
they
were
there
routilov
sniggered
and
exclaimed
what
a
funny
thing
volodin
assumed
an
injured
look
and
scolded
the
marker
if
you
allow
the
billiard
balls
to
be
stolen
when
you
are
somewhere
else
and
the
billiard
balls
disappear
then
you
ought
to
have
provided
others
for
us
to
have
something
to
play
with
we
come
here
and
want
to
play
and
if
there
are
no
billiard
balls
how
can
we
play
do
whine
pavloushka
said
peredonov
it
bad
enough
without
you
now
marker
you
go
and
look
for
those
balls
we
must
play
but
meanwhile
bring
us
a
couple
of
beers
they
began
to
drink
the
beer
but
it
was
tedious
the
billiard
balls
could
not
be
found
they
wrangled
with
one
another
and
they
cursed
the
marker
the
latter
felt
guilty
and
said
nothing
peredonov
detected
in
this
theft
a
new
intrigue
hostile
to
himself
why
he
thought
dejectedly
and
could
not
understand
he
went
into
the
garden
sat
down
on
a
bench
near
the
pond
he
had
never
sat
there
before
and
fixed
his
eyes
dully
on
the
water
volodin
sat
down
beside
him
and
shared
his
grief
looking
also
at
the
pond
with
his
sheepish
eyes
why
is
there
such
a
dirty
mirror
here
pavloushka
said
peredonov
pointing
at
the
pond
with
his
stick
volodin
smiled
and
replied
it
not
a
mirror
ardasha
it
a
pond
and
as
there
no
breeze
just
now
the
trees
are
reflected
in
it
as
if
in
a
mirror
peredonov
looked
up
a
fence
on
the
other
side
of
the
pond
separated
the
garden
from
the
street
peredonov
asked
why
is
the
cat
on
that
fence
volodin
looked
in
the
same
direction
and
said
with
a
snigger
it
was
there
but
it
gone
there
really
had
been
no
cat
it
was
an
illusion
of
peredonov
a
cat
with
wide
green
eyes
his
cunning
tireless
enemy
peredonov
began
to
think
about
the
billiard
balls
who
needed
them
has
the
nedotikomka
devoured
them
perhaps
why
i
have
seen
it
thought
peredonov
it
must
have
gorged
itself
and
be
asleep
somewhere
now
peredonov
went
home
dejectedly
the
sunset
was
fading
a
small
cloud
was
wandering
across
the
sky
she
moved
stealthily
on
her
soft
shoes
and
peeped
out
at
him
on
her
dark
edges
a
reflection
smiled
enigmatically
above
the
stream
which
flowed
between
the
garden
and
the
town
the
shadows
of
the
houses
and
the
bushes
wavered
whispered
to
each
other
and
seemed
to
be
searching
for
someone
and
on
the
earth
in
this
dark
and
eternally
hostile
town
all
the
people
he
met
were
evil
and
malicious
everything
became
mingled
in
a
general
towards
peredonov
the
dogs
laughed
at
him
and
the
people
barked
at
him
the
ladies
of
the
town
began
to
visit
varvara
some
of
them
with
an
eager
curiosity
had
managed
to
pay
a
visit
on
the
second
or
third
day
to
see
how
varvara
looked
at
home
others
delayed
a
week
or
more
and
still
others
did
not
come
at
all
as
for
instance
vershina
the
peredonovs
awaited
return
visits
every
day
with
anxious
impatience
they
counted
up
those
who
had
not
yet
come
they
awaited
the
and
his
wife
with
special
impatience
they
waited
and
were
immensely
agitated
for
fear
that
the
khripatches
should
suddenly
arrive
a
week
had
passed
the
khripatches
had
not
yet
come
varvara
had
got
into
a
temper
and
began
to
pour
out
abuse
this
waiting
plunged
peredonov
into
a
deeply
depressed
state
of
mind
peredonov
eyes
became
entirely
vacant
it
was
as
if
they
were
becoming
extinguished
and
sometimes
they
seemed
like
the
eyes
of
a
dead
man
absurd
fears
tormented
him
without
any
visible
cause
he
began
to
be
afraid
of
one
or
another
object
an
idea
somehow
came
into
his
head
and
tormented
him
for
several
days
that
they
would
cut
his
throat
he
was
afraid
of
everything
sharp
and
hid
the
knives
and
the
forks
perhaps
he
thought
they
been
bewitched
by
whispered
spells
it
might
happen
that
i
might
cut
myself
with
them
why
are
there
knives
he
asked
varvara
chinamen
eat
with
chopsticks
for
a
whole
week
after
this
they
did
not
cook
any
meat
but
lived
on
and
gruel
varvara
to
get
even
with
peredonov
for
the
troubles
he
had
caused
her
before
their
wedding
sometimes
agreed
with
him
and
encouraged
him
to
think
that
his
fancies
and
superstitions
had
a
basis
in
reality
she
told
him
that
he
had
many
enemies
and
that
they
had
every
reason
to
envy
him
more
than
once
she
told
peredonov
tauntingly
that
he
had
been
informed
against
and
slandered
to
the
authorities
and
the
princess
and
she
rejoiced
at
his
visible
fear
it
seemed
clear
to
peredonov
that
the
princess
was
dissatisfied
with
him
why
could
she
have
sent
him
for
his
wedding
an
ikon
or
cake
he
thought
ought
he
to
earn
her
favour
but
how
by
falsehood
should
he
slander
someone
calumniate
someone
inform
against
someone
he
knew
that
all
women
love
and
so
could
he
invent
something
something
pleasant
and
about
varvara
and
write
it
to
the
princess
she
would
laugh
and
give
him
the
place
but
peredonov
was
not
able
to
write
the
letter
and
felt
apprehensive
about
writing
to
a
princess
and
later
he
forgot
all
about
this
scheme
peredonov
gave
ordinary
visitors
vodka
and
the
cheapest
but
he
bought
a
bottle
of
madeira
for
the
he
considered
this
wine
extremely
expensive
kept
it
in
his
bedroom
and
showed
it
to
his
visitors
saying
it
for
the
routilov
and
volodin
were
once
sitting
at
peredonov
peredonov
showed
them
the
madeira
what
the
good
of
looking
at
the
outside
it
does
taste
well
said
routilov
with
a
snigger
you
might
treat
us
to
some
of
your
expensive
madeira
what
an
idea
exclaimed
peredonov
angrily
what
should
i
give
the
the
could
drink
a
glass
of
vodka
said
routilov
do
drink
vodka
they
have
to
drink
madeira
said
peredonov
reasonably
but
suppose
he
likes
vodka
persisted
routilov
good
heavens
you
do
suppose
a
general
would
like
vodka
said
peredonov
with
conviction
all
the
same
you
better
give
us
some
of
it
insisted
routilov
but
peredonov
quickly
took
away
the
bottle
and
they
heard
the
click
of
the
lock
on
the
little
cupboard
in
which
he
kept
the
wine
when
he
came
back
to
his
guests
he
began
to
talk
about
the
princess
to
change
the
conversation
he
said
quite
gravely
the
princess
why
she
sold
rotten
apples
in
the
market
and
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
prince
routilov
burst
out
laughing
and
shouted
do
princes
walk
about
markets
oh
she
knew
how
to
entice
him
in
said
peredonov
you
making
it
up
ardalyon
borisitch
it
a
story
argued
routilov
the
princess
is
a
born
lady
peredonov
looked
at
him
malignantly
and
thought
he
defending
her
that
means
he
siding
with
the
princess
clear
that
she
bewitched
him
although
she
lives
at
a
distance
and
the
nedotikomka
wriggled
about
him
laughed
noiselessly
and
shook
all
over
with
laughter
it
reminded
peredonov
of
various
dreadful
circumstances
he
looked
around
timidly
and
whispered
in
every
town
there
a
sergeant
of
the
gendarmes
in
the
secret
service
he
wears
civilian
clothes
sometimes
he
in
the
civil
service
sometimes
he
a
tradesman
or
he
does
something
else
but
at
night
when
everyone
is
asleep
he
puts
on
his
blue
uniform
and
suddenly
becomes
a
sergeant
of
the
gendarmes
but
why
the
uniform
inquired
volodin
reasonably
because
no
one
dares
to
appear
before
the
authorities
without
a
uniform
you
might
get
beaten
for
doing
it
volodin
sniggered
peredonov
bent
over
him
closer
and
whispered
sometimes
he
even
lives
in
the
shape
of
a
you
may
think
it
simply
a
cat
but
that
an
error
it
really
a
gendarme
running
about
no
one
hides
from
a
cat
and
he
listens
to
everything
said
at
last
after
a
week
and
a
half
the
wife
paid
a
visit
to
varvara
she
arrived
with
her
husband
on
a
at
four
all
dressed
up
bringing
a
perfume
of
violets
with
her
altogether
unexpectedly
for
the
peredonovs
who
for
some
reason
had
expected
the
khripatches
on
a
sunday
earlier
in
the
day
they
were
dumbfounded
varvara
was
in
the
kitchen
and
dirty
she
rushed
away
to
get
dressed
and
peredonov
received
the
visitors
looking
as
if
he
had
been
just
awakened
varvara
will
be
here
immediately
he
mumbled
she
dressing
herself
she
was
working
we
have
a
new
servant
who
does
understand
our
ways
she
a
hopeless
fool
soon
varvara
came
in
dressed
somehow
with
a
flushed
frightened
face
she
extended
to
her
visitors
a
dirty
damp
hand
and
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
agitation
you
must
forgive
me
for
keeping
you
waiting
we
did
expect
you
on
a
i
seldom
go
out
on
a
sunday
said
madame
khripatch
there
are
drunkards
in
the
street
i
let
my
have
her
day
out
the
conversation
somehow
started
and
the
kindness
of
the
wife
somewhat
encouraged
varvara
madame
khripatch
treated
varvara
with
a
slight
contemptuousness
but
graciously
as
with
a
repented
sinner
who
had
to
be
treated
kindly
but
who
might
still
soil
one
hands
she
gave
varvara
several
hints
as
if
incidentally
about
clothes
and
housekeeping
varvara
tried
to
please
the
wife
but
her
red
hands
and
chapped
lips
still
trembled
with
fear
this
embarrassed
madame
khripatch
she
tried
to
be
even
more
gracious
but
an
involuntary
fastidiousness
overcame
her
by
her
whole
attitude
she
showed
varvara
that
there
could
never
be
a
close
acquaintance
between
them
but
she
did
this
so
graciously
that
varvara
did
not
understand
and
imagined
that
she
and
madame
khripatch
would
become
great
friends
khripatch
had
the
look
of
a
man
out
of
his
element
but
he
concealed
the
fact
skilfully
and
manfully
he
refused
the
madeira
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
used
to
drinking
wine
at
that
hour
of
the
day
he
talked
about
the
local
news
about
the
approaching
changes
in
the
composition
of
the
district
court
but
it
was
very
noticeable
that
he
and
peredonov
moved
in
different
circles
of
local
society
they
did
not
make
a
long
visit
varvara
was
glad
when
they
left
they
just
came
and
went
she
said
with
relief
as
she
took
off
her
clothes
well
thank
god
they
gone
i
did
know
what
to
talk
to
them
about
when
you
do
know
people
you
ca
tell
how
to
get
at
them
suddenly
she
remembered
that
when
the
khripatches
left
they
had
not
invited
her
to
their
house
this
distressed
her
at
first
but
afterwards
she
thought
they
send
a
card
with
a
note
when
to
come
gentry
like
them
have
a
time
for
everything
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
a
go
at
french
i
even
say
and
in
french
when
they
got
home
the
wife
said
to
her
husband
she
simply
pitiful
and
hopelessly
vulgar
it
utterly
impossible
to
be
on
equal
terms
with
her
there
nothing
in
her
to
correspond
with
her
position
khripatch
replied
she
fully
corresponds
with
her
husband
i
impatiently
waiting
for
them
to
take
him
away
from
us
after
the
wedding
varvara
began
to
drink
now
and
then
most
frequently
with
grushina
once
when
she
was
a
little
tipsy
prepolovenskaya
was
at
her
house
and
varvara
blabbed
about
the
letter
she
did
tell
everything
but
she
hinted
sufficiently
clearly
this
was
enough
for
the
cunning
sofya
it
was
a
sudden
revelation
to
her
but
why
did
i
guess
it
at
once
she
mentally
reproached
herself
she
told
vershina
in
confidence
about
the
forged
letters
and
from
her
it
spread
all
over
the
town
prepolovenskaya
could
not
help
laughing
at
peredonov
credulousness
whenever
she
met
him
she
said
to
him
you
very
simple
ardalyon
borisitch
i
not
simple
at
all
he
replied
i
a
graduate
of
a
university
you
may
be
a
graduate
but
anyone
who
wants
to
can
take
you
in
i
can
take
in
everyone
myself
argued
peredonov
prepolovenskaya
smiled
slyly
and
left
him
peredonov
was
dully
perplexed
what
does
she
mean
it
out
of
spite
he
thought
everyone
my
enemy
and
he
made
a
koukish
after
her
you
get
nothing
out
of
me
he
thought
consoling
himself
but
he
was
tormented
by
dread
her
hints
did
not
seem
very
satisfactory
to
prepolovenskaya
but
she
did
not
want
to
tell
him
everything
in
plain
words
why
should
she
quarrel
with
varvara
from
time
to
time
she
sent
peredonov
anonymous
letters
in
which
the
hints
were
clearer
but
peredonov
misunderstood
them
sofya
once
wrote
him
you
had
better
see
whether
that
princess
who
wrote
you
the
letter
does
live
here
peredonov
thought
that
perhaps
the
princess
had
really
come
to
the
town
to
watch
his
movements
it
obvious
he
thought
that
she
in
love
with
me
and
wants
to
get
me
away
from
varvara
and
these
letters
both
frightened
and
angered
him
he
kept
asking
varvara
where
is
the
princess
i
hear
that
she
has
come
to
the
town
varvara
to
get
even
with
him
for
what
had
happened
before
the
marriage
tormented
him
with
vague
hints
taunts
and
malignant
insinuations
she
smiled
insolently
and
said
to
him
in
that
strained
voice
which
is
usually
heard
from
a
person
who
lies
knowingly
without
the
hope
of
being
believed
how
should
i
know
where
the
princess
lives
now
you
lying
you
do
know
said
peredonov
in
terror
he
did
not
know
what
to
believe
the
meaning
of
her
words
or
the
lie
betrayed
in
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
this
like
everything
he
did
not
understand
terrified
him
varvara
retorted
what
an
idea
perhaps
she
left
peter
for
somewhere
else
she
have
to
ask
me
when
she
goes
away
but
perhaps
she
really
has
come
here
asked
peredonov
timidly
perhaps
she
really
has
come
here
varvara
mimicked
him
smitten
with
you
and
she
come
here
to
see
you
you
a
liar
is
it
likely
that
she
fall
in
love
with
me
varvara
laughed
spitefully
from
that
time
peredonov
began
to
look
about
attentively
for
the
princess
sometimes
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
looking
in
at
the
window
through
the
door
eavesdropping
and
whispering
with
varvara
time
passed
by
and
the
paper
announcing
his
appointment
as
inspector
so
eagerly
expected
day
after
day
still
did
not
come
he
had
no
private
information
of
the
situation
peredonov
did
not
dare
to
find
out
from
the
princess
herself
varvara
constantly
frightened
him
by
saying
that
the
princess
was
a
very
great
lady
and
he
thought
that
if
he
wrote
to
her
it
might
cause
him
extreme
unpleasantness
he
did
not
know
precisely
what
they
could
do
to
him
if
the
princess
complained
of
him
but
this
made
him
think
of
dreadful
possibilities
varvara
said
to
him
do
you
know
aristocrats
you
must
wait
until
they
act
of
themselves
but
once
you
remind
them
they
get
offended
and
it
be
the
worse
for
you
they
so
touchy
they
proud
and
they
like
to
be
taken
at
their
word
and
peredonov
was
still
credulous
but
he
got
angry
with
the
princess
sometimes
he
even
thought
that
the
princess
would
inform
against
him
in
order
to
rid
herself
of
her
obligations
to
him
or
else
she
would
inform
against
him
because
he
had
married
varvara
when
perhaps
she
herself
was
in
love
with
him
that
was
why
she
had
surrounded
him
with
spies
he
thought
who
kept
an
eye
on
him
everywhere
they
had
so
hemmed
him
in
that
he
had
no
air
to
breathe
no
light
she
was
not
an
eminent
lady
for
nothing
she
could
do
whatever
she
liked
from
spite
he
invented
most
unlikely
stories
about
the
princess
he
told
routilov
and
volodin
that
he
had
formerly
been
her
lover
and
that
she
had
given
him
large
sums
of
money
but
i
drunk
it
all
away
he
said
why
the
devil
should
i
save
it
she
also
promised
me
a
pension
for
life
but
she
took
me
in
over
that
and
would
you
have
accepted
it
asked
routilov
with
a
snigger
peredonov
was
silent
he
did
not
understand
the
question
but
volodin
answered
for
him
gravely
and
judiciously
why
not
accept
it
if
she
rich
she
gratified
herself
with
pleasures
and
she
ought
to
pay
for
them
if
she
were
at
least
a
beauty
said
peredonov
mournfully
freckled
and
she
paid
very
well
otherwise
i
would
even
want
to
spit
at
the
hag
she
must
attend
to
my
request
you
a
liar
ardalyon
borisitch
said
routilov
a
liar
what
an
idea
do
you
suppose
she
paid
me
for
nothing
jealous
of
varvara
and
that
why
she
does
give
me
the
job
at
once
peredonov
did
not
feel
any
shame
when
he
said
that
the
princess
paid
him
volodin
was
a
credulous
listener
and
did
not
notice
the
absurdities
and
contradictions
in
his
stories
routilov
protested
but
thought
that
without
fire
there
can
be
no
smoke
he
thought
there
must
have
been
something
between
peredonov
and
the
princess
she
older
than
the
priest
dog
said
peredonov
convincingly
as
if
it
were
to
the
point
but
see
that
you
do
blab
about
it
because
it
might
come
to
her
ears
and
do
no
good
she
paints
herself
and
she
tries
to
make
herself
as
young
as
a
by
injecting
things
in
her
veins
and
you
know
that
she
old
she
really
a
hundred
volodin
nodded
his
head
and
clicked
his
tongue
affirmatively
he
believed
it
all
it
so
happened
that
on
the
day
after
this
conversation
peredonov
read
krilov
fable
the
liar
and
for
several
days
afterwards
he
was
afraid
to
go
over
the
bridge
but
crossed
the
river
in
a
boat
for
fear
that
the
bridge
should
tumble
down
he
explained
to
volodin
what
i
said
about
the
princess
was
the
truth
only
the
bridge
might
take
a
sudden
notion
not
to
believe
my
story
and
tumble
down
to
the
devil
there
is
a
popular
russian
tale
about
a
priest
who
had
a
very
old
dog
it
begins
the
priest
had
a
dog
krilov
fable
is
of
a
returned
traveller
who
tells
his
friend
at
home
about
a
cucumber
he
saw
at
rome
as
large
as
a
mountain
the
incredulous
friend
tells
him
about
one
of
the
home
wonders
a
bridge
which
tumbles
every
liar
who
attempts
to
cross
it
into
the
river
the
traveller
gradually
reduces
the
size
of
the
cucumber
but
even
then
he
finally
suggests
that
they
find
a
place
where
they
might
ford
the
stream
chapter
xxv
rumours
of
the
forged
letters
spread
about
the
town
conversations
about
them
preoccupied
the
townsmen
and
gave
them
great
pleasure
nearly
everyone
took
varvara
part
and
was
glad
that
peredonov
had
been
made
a
fool
of
and
all
those
who
had
seen
the
letters
asserted
as
with
one
voice
that
they
had
guessed
it
at
once
especially
great
was
the
rejoicing
in
vershina
house
marta
though
she
was
going
to
marry
mourin
had
nevertheless
been
rejected
by
peredonov
vershina
wanted
mourin
for
herself
but
she
had
to
yield
him
to
marta
vladya
had
his
obvious
reasons
for
hating
peredonov
and
for
rejoicing
at
his
discomfiture
though
he
felt
vexed
to
think
that
peredonov
would
remain
at
the
still
this
vexation
was
outweighed
by
his
pleasure
at
the
fact
that
peredonov
had
been
let
down
badly
and
besides
this
during
the
last
few
days
there
was
a
persistent
rumour
that
the
had
informed
the
director
of
the
national
schools
that
peredonov
was
out
of
his
mind
and
someone
was
going
to
be
sent
to
examine
him
after
which
he
would
be
taken
away
whenever
her
acquaintances
met
varvara
they
would
refer
more
or
less
openly
to
her
stratagem
accompanying
their
words
with
coarse
jokes
and
impudent
winks
she
would
smile
insolently
and
would
not
admit
it
but
she
did
not
deny
it
others
hinted
to
grushina
that
they
knew
of
her
share
in
the
forgery
she
was
frightened
and
came
to
varvara
reproaching
her
for
gossiping
too
much
varvara
said
to
her
with
a
smile
now
do
make
such
a
fuss
i
never
had
the
least
intention
of
telling
anyone
how
did
they
find
it
out
then
asked
grushina
hotly
of
course
i
should
tell
anyone
i
not
such
a
fool
and
i
have
told
anyone
asserted
varvara
i
want
the
letter
back
demanded
grushina
or
else
he
begin
to
look
at
it
closely
and
he
recognise
from
the
handwriting
that
it
a
forgery
well
let
him
find
out
said
varvara
why
should
i
stop
to
consider
a
fool
grushina
eyes
gleamed
and
she
shouted
it
all
very
well
for
you
who
got
all
you
wanted
but
i
might
be
jailed
on
your
account
no
i
must
have
that
letter
whatever
you
do
because
they
can
unmarry
you
as
well
you
know
that
all
nonsense
replied
varvara
with
her
arms
insolently
akimbo
you
might
announce
it
in
the
but
you
could
undo
the
marriage
not
nonsense
at
all
shouted
grushina
there
is
no
law
that
permits
you
to
marry
through
deception
if
ardalyon
borisitch
should
let
the
authorities
know
about
this
affair
and
the
affair
went
up
to
the
higher
court
they
settle
your
hash
for
you
varvara
got
frightened
and
said
now
do
be
angry
i
get
you
the
letter
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
i
not
give
you
away
i
not
such
a
beast
as
all
that
i
got
a
soul
too
what
a
soul
got
to
do
with
it
said
grushina
harshly
a
dog
and
a
man
have
the
same
breath
but
there
is
no
soul
you
live
while
you
live
varvara
decided
to
steal
the
letter
though
this
was
difficult
grushina
urged
her
to
hurry
there
was
one
hope
to
take
the
letter
from
peredonov
when
he
was
drunk
and
he
drank
a
great
deal
now
he
had
even
not
infrequently
appeared
at
the
in
a
rather
tipsy
state
and
had
made
unpleasant
remarks
which
had
aroused
repugnance
in
even
the
worst
of
the
boys
once
peredonov
returned
from
the
billiard
saloon
more
drunk
than
usual
they
had
baptised
the
new
billiard
balls
but
he
never
let
go
of
his
wallet
as
he
managed
to
undress
somehow
he
stuck
it
under
his
pillow
he
slept
restlessly
but
profoundly
and
during
his
sleep
his
mind
wandered
and
he
babbled
about
something
terrible
and
monstrous
and
these
words
inspired
varvara
with
a
painful
apprehension
well
it
nothing
she
encouraged
herself
so
long
as
he
wake
up
she
had
tried
to
waken
him
she
nudged
him
he
only
muttered
something
and
cursed
violently
but
did
not
awaken
varvara
lit
a
candle
and
placed
it
so
that
the
light
should
not
fall
into
peredonov
eyes
numb
with
terror
she
rose
in
the
bed
and
slipped
her
hand
under
pillow
the
wallet
was
quite
close
but
for
a
long
time
it
seemed
to
elude
her
fingers
the
candle
burned
dimly
its
light
wavered
timorous
shadows
ran
on
the
walls
and
on
the
bed
evil
little
devils
flashed
by
the
air
was
close
and
motionless
there
was
a
smell
of
vodka
peredonov
snores
and
drunken
ravings
filled
the
bedroom
the
whole
place
was
like
the
incarnation
of
a
nightmare
varvara
took
the
letter
with
trembling
hands
and
replaced
the
wallet
in
the
morning
peredonov
looked
for
his
letter
failed
to
find
it
and
shouted
in
a
fright
where
the
letter
varya
varvara
felt
very
much
afraid
but
concealed
it
and
said
how
should
i
know
ardalyon
borisitch
you
keep
showing
it
to
everyone
you
must
have
dropped
it
or
else
someone
has
stolen
it
from
you
you
have
a
lot
of
friends
and
acquaintances
that
you
get
drunk
with
at
night
peredonov
thought
that
the
letter
had
been
stolen
by
his
enemies
most
likely
by
volodin
the
letter
was
now
in
volodin
hands
and
later
he
would
get
the
other
papers
and
the
appointment
into
his
clutches
and
he
would
go
away
to
his
inspectorship
while
peredonov
remained
a
disappointed
beggar
peredonov
decided
that
he
must
defend
himself
every
day
he
wrote
denunciations
of
his
enemies
vershina
the
routilovs
volodin
his
colleagues
who
it
seemed
to
him
had
their
eye
on
the
same
position
in
the
evening
he
would
take
these
denunciations
to
roubovsky
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
lived
in
a
prominent
place
on
the
square
near
the
many
people
observed
from
their
windows
how
often
peredonov
entered
the
gates
of
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
but
peredonov
thought
that
he
was
unobserved
he
had
good
reason
to
take
these
denunciations
at
night
by
the
back
way
through
the
kitchen
he
kept
the
papers
under
his
coat
it
was
noticeable
at
once
that
he
was
holding
something
when
it
happened
that
he
had
to
take
his
hand
out
to
shake
hands
with
someone
he
clutched
the
papers
under
his
coat
with
his
left
hand
and
imagined
that
no
one
would
guess
that
anything
was
there
when
his
acquaintances
asked
him
where
he
was
going
he
lied
to
them
very
clumsily
but
was
very
satisfied
himself
with
his
awkward
inventions
he
explained
to
roubovsky
they
all
traitors
they
pretend
to
be
your
friends
so
as
to
be
more
certain
of
deceiving
you
but
none
of
them
stop
to
think
that
i
know
things
about
them
that
would
send
them
all
to
siberia
roubovsky
listened
to
him
in
silence
the
first
denunciation
which
was
patently
absurd
he
sent
to
the
and
he
did
the
same
thing
with
several
others
he
kept
certain
others
in
case
he
should
need
them
the
wrote
to
the
director
of
national
schools
that
peredonov
was
showing
clear
symptoms
of
mental
disease
at
home
peredonov
constantly
heard
ceaseless
exasperating
and
mocking
rustlings
he
said
to
varvara
dejectedly
someone
walking
about
on
there
are
so
many
spies
in
the
house
jostling
each
other
varya
you
not
taking
care
of
me
varvara
did
not
understand
the
meaning
of
peredonov
ravings
at
one
time
she
taunted
him
at
another
she
felt
afraid
she
said
to
him
malignantly
and
yet
with
fear
you
see
all
sorts
of
things
when
you
drunk
the
door
to
the
hall
seemed
especially
suspicious
to
peredonov
it
did
not
close
tightly
the
crevice
between
the
two
halves
hinted
at
something
that
was
hiding
outside
was
it
the
knave
who
was
peeping
through
it
someone
evil
penetrating
eye
gleamed
behind
it
the
cat
followed
peredonov
everywhere
with
its
wide
green
eyes
sometimes
it
blinked
its
eyes
sometimes
it
mewed
fearfully
it
was
obvious
that
the
animal
wanted
to
catch
peredonov
at
something
but
it
could
not
and
was
therefore
angry
peredonov
exorcised
the
cat
by
spitting
but
the
cat
remained
unmoved
the
nedotikomka
ran
under
the
chair
and
in
the
corners
and
squealed
it
was
dirty
repulsive
and
terrifying
it
was
already
quite
clear
that
it
was
hostile
to
peredonov
and
rolled
in
entirely
on
his
account
and
that
it
had
not
existed
anywhere
before
it
had
been
created
and
it
had
been
bewitched
and
this
evil
beast
lived
here
to
his
dread
and
to
his
perdition
followed
him
deceived
him
laughed
at
him
now
rolled
upon
the
floor
now
turned
into
a
rag
a
ribbon
a
twig
a
flag
a
small
cloud
a
little
dog
a
pillar
of
dust
in
the
street
and
everywhere
it
crawled
and
ran
after
peredonov
it
harassed
him
it
wearied
him
with
its
vacillating
dance
if
only
someone
would
deliver
him
from
it
with
a
word
or
with
a
downright
blow
but
he
had
no
friends
here
there
was
no
one
to
come
to
save
him
he
must
use
his
own
cunning
or
the
malicious
beast
would
ruin
him
peredonov
thought
of
a
device
he
smeared
the
entire
floor
with
glue
so
that
the
nedotikomka
should
get
stuck
what
did
stick
to
the
floor
was
the
soles
of
varvara
shoes
and
the
hems
of
her
dress
but
the
nedotikomka
rolled
on
freely
and
laughed
shrilly
varvara
abused
him
loudly
persistent
suspicions
of
being
under
constant
persecution
frightened
him
more
and
more
he
became
immersed
in
a
world
of
wild
illusions
this
reflected
itself
in
his
face
which
became
a
motionless
mask
of
terror
in
the
evenings
peredonov
no
longer
went
to
play
billiards
after
dinner
he
shut
himself
in
his
bedroom
barricaded
the
room
with
various
objects
a
chair
upon
a
table
and
very
carefully
surrounded
himself
with
crosses
and
exorcisms
and
sat
down
to
write
denunciations
against
everyone
he
could
think
of
he
wrote
denunciations
not
only
against
people
but
against
queens
as
soon
as
he
had
written
one
he
would
take
it
immediately
to
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
and
in
this
way
he
spent
every
evening
everywhere
walked
before
peredonov
eyes
as
if
they
were
alive
kings
queens
and
knaves
even
the
other
cards
walked
about
these
consisted
of
people
with
silver
buttons
schoolboys
and
policemen
there
was
the
ace
of
spades
stout
with
a
protruding
stomach
almost
entirely
stomach
sometimes
the
cards
became
transformed
into
his
acquaintances
living
people
were
mixed
up
with
these
strange
phantasms
peredonov
was
convinced
that
a
knave
was
standing
behind
the
door
and
that
he
had
strength
and
power
something
like
a
policeman
and
that
he
could
take
you
away
somewhere
to
some
terrible
jail
under
the
table
sat
the
nedotikomka
and
peredonov
was
afraid
to
glance
either
under
the
table
or
behind
the
door
the
nimble
eights
of
the
pack
like
little
boys
mocked
at
peredonov
these
were
the
phantasms
of
schoolboys
they
lifted
their
legs
with
strange
stiff
movements
like
the
legs
of
a
compass
but
their
legs
were
shaggy
and
with
hoofs
instead
of
tails
they
had
whipping
rods
which
they
swung
with
a
swish
and
at
each
flourish
they
gave
a
squeak
the
nedotikomka
grunted
from
under
the
table
and
laughed
at
the
play
of
these
eights
peredonov
thought
with
rage
that
the
nedotikomka
would
not
have
dared
to
come
to
an
official
they
surely
would
let
it
in
he
thought
enviously
the
lackeys
would
drive
it
out
with
their
mops
at
last
peredonov
could
no
longer
stand
its
evil
insolently
shrill
laughter
he
brought
an
axe
from
the
kitchen
and
he
split
the
table
under
which
the
nedotikomka
was
hiding
the
nedotikomka
squeaked
piteously
and
furiously
it
dashed
out
from
under
the
table
and
rolled
away
peredonov
trembled
it
might
bite
he
thought
and
screamed
with
terror
and
sat
down
but
the
nedotikomka
hid
itself
peacefully
not
for
long
sometimes
peredonov
took
the
cards
and
with
a
ferocious
expression
on
his
face
cut
the
heads
off
the
court
cards
especially
those
of
the
queens
in
cutting
the
kings
he
glanced
around
him
so
as
not
to
be
detected
and
not
to
be
accused
of
a
political
crime
but
even
these
executions
did
not
help
for
long
visitors
came
cards
were
brought
and
evil
spies
again
took
possession
of
the
cards
peredonov
already
began
to
consider
himself
a
secret
criminal
he
imagined
that
even
from
his
student
days
he
had
been
under
the
surveillance
of
the
police
for
some
reason
he
thought
that
they
were
watching
him
this
terrified
and
yet
flattered
him
the
wind
stirred
the
it
shook
with
a
quiet
evil
rustling
and
soft
glided
over
their
vividly
coloured
patterns
there
a
spy
hiding
behind
the
thought
peredonov
sadly
evil
people
no
wonder
they
put
the
paper
on
the
wall
so
unevenly
and
so
poorly
for
a
skilful
patient
flat
villain
to
creep
in
and
hide
behind
such
things
have
happened
even
before
confused
recollections
stirred
in
his
mind
someone
had
hidden
behind
the
someone
had
been
stabbed
either
with
a
poignard
or
an
awl
peredonov
bought
an
awl
and
when
he
returned
home
the
stirred
unevenly
and
restlessly
a
spy
felt
his
danger
and
was
perhaps
trying
to
creep
in
farther
a
shadow
jumped
to
the
ceiling
and
there
threatened
and
grimaced
peredonov
was
infuriated
he
struck
the
impetuously
with
the
awl
a
shiver
ran
over
the
wall
peredonov
began
to
sing
triumphantly
and
to
dance
brandishing
the
awl
varvara
came
in
why
are
you
dancing
by
yourself
ardalyon
borisitch
she
asked
smiling
stupidly
and
insolently
as
always
i
killed
a
beetle
explained
peredonov
morosely
his
eyes
gleamed
in
wild
triumph
only
one
thing
annoyed
him
the
disagreeable
odour
the
murdered
spy
stank
putridly
behind
the
horror
and
triumph
shook
peredonov
he
had
killed
an
enemy
he
had
hardened
his
heart
to
the
very
end
of
the
deed
it
was
not
a
real
murder
but
for
peredonov
it
was
quite
real
a
mad
horror
had
forged
in
him
a
readiness
to
commit
the
crime
and
the
deep
unconscious
image
of
future
murder
dormant
in
the
lower
strata
of
spiritual
life
the
tormenting
itch
to
murder
a
condition
of
primitive
wrath
oppressed
his
diseased
will
the
ancient
cain
overlaid
by
many
generations
found
gratification
in
his
breaking
and
damaging
property
in
his
chopping
with
the
axe
in
his
cutting
with
the
knife
in
his
cutting
down
trees
in
the
garden
to
prevent
the
spies
from
looking
out
behind
them
and
the
ancient
demon
the
spirit
of
prehistoric
confusion
of
hoary
chaos
rejoiced
in
the
destruction
of
things
while
the
wild
eyes
of
the
madman
reflected
horror
like
the
horror
of
the
death
agonies
of
some
monster
and
the
same
illusions
tormented
him
again
and
again
varvara
amusing
herself
at
peredonov
expense
sometimes
hid
herself
behind
the
door
of
the
room
where
he
was
sitting
and
talked
in
assumed
voices
he
would
get
frightened
walk
up
quietly
to
catch
the
enemy
and
find
varvara
whom
were
you
whispering
to
he
asked
sadly
varvara
smiled
and
replied
it
only
seemed
to
you
ardalyon
borisitch
surely
everything
does
merely
seem
to
me
muttered
peredonov
sadly
there
must
be
also
truth
upon
the
earth
even
peredonov
in
common
with
all
conscious
life
strove
towards
the
truth
and
this
striving
tortured
him
he
was
not
conscious
that
he
like
all
people
was
striving
towards
the
truth
and
that
was
why
he
suffered
this
confused
restlessness
he
could
not
find
the
truth
he
sought
and
he
was
caught
in
the
toils
and
was
perishing
his
acquaintances
began
to
taunt
him
with
being
a
dupe
with
the
usual
cruelty
of
our
town
towards
the
weak
they
talked
of
this
deception
in
his
presence
prepolovenskaya
asked
with
a
derisive
smile
how
is
it
ardalyon
borisitch
that
you
have
gone
away
to
your
inspector
job
yet
varvara
answered
for
him
with
suppressed
anger
we
shall
get
the
paper
soon
and
we
shall
leave
at
once
but
these
questions
depressed
him
how
can
i
live
if
the
place
is
given
to
me
he
thought
he
kept
devising
new
plans
of
defence
against
his
enemies
he
stole
the
axe
from
the
kitchen
and
hid
it
under
the
bed
he
bought
a
swedish
knife
and
always
carried
it
about
in
his
pocket
he
frequently
locked
himself
in
his
room
at
night
he
put
traps
around
the
house
and
in
the
rooms
and
later
he
would
examine
them
these
traps
were
of
course
so
constructed
that
they
could
not
catch
anyone
they
gripped
but
could
not
hold
anyone
and
it
was
easy
to
walk
away
with
them
but
peredonov
had
no
technical
knowledge
and
no
common
sense
when
he
saw
each
morning
that
no
one
was
caught
peredonov
imagined
that
his
enemies
had
tampered
with
the
traps
this
again
frightened
him
peredonov
watched
volodin
with
special
attention
he
frequently
went
to
volodin
when
he
knew
that
volodin
would
not
be
at
home
and
rummaged
among
the
papers
to
see
if
there
were
any
stolen
from
himself
peredonov
began
to
suspect
what
the
princess
wanted
it
was
that
he
should
love
her
again
she
was
repugnant
to
him
a
decrepit
old
woman
she
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
he
thought
with
vexation
yes
she
old
but
then
how
powerful
she
is
and
his
repulsion
became
mingled
with
an
allurement
she
an
almost
cold
little
old
woman
she
smells
slightly
of
a
corpse
he
imagined
and
he
felt
faint
with
a
savage
voluptuousness
perhaps
it
would
be
possible
to
arrange
a
meeting
and
her
heart
would
be
touched
ought
i
to
send
her
a
letter
this
time
peredonov
with
slight
hesitation
composed
a
letter
to
the
princess
he
wrote
i
love
you
because
you
are
cold
and
remote
varvara
perspires
it
is
hot
to
sleep
with
her
it
is
like
the
breath
of
an
oven
i
would
like
to
have
a
cold
and
remote
love
come
here
and
respond
to
me
he
wrote
it
and
posted
it
and
then
repented
what
will
come
of
it
he
thought
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
have
written
i
should
have
waited
until
the
princess
came
here
this
letter
was
an
accidental
occurrence
like
so
much
that
peredonov
did
he
was
like
a
corpse
moved
by
external
powers
and
moved
as
if
these
powers
had
no
desire
to
busy
themselves
with
him
for
long
one
would
play
with
him
and
then
cast
him
to
another
soon
the
nedotikomka
reappeared
for
a
long
time
it
rolled
around
peredonov
as
if
it
were
on
the
end
of
a
lasso
and
kept
mocking
him
and
it
was
now
noiseless
and
laughed
only
with
a
shaking
of
its
body
the
evil
shameless
beast
flared
up
with
dimly
golden
sparks
it
threatened
and
burned
with
an
intolerable
triumph
and
the
cat
threatened
peredonov
its
eyes
gleamed
and
it
mewed
arrogantly
and
fiercely
why
are
they
so
glad
thought
peredonov
dejectedly
and
suddenly
understood
that
the
end
was
approaching
that
the
princess
was
already
here
close
quite
close
perhaps
she
was
in
this
very
pack
of
cards
yes
undoubtedly
she
was
the
queen
of
spades
or
the
queen
of
hearts
perhaps
she
was
hiding
in
another
pack
or
in
other
cards
but
he
did
not
know
what
she
looked
like
the
difficulty
was
that
peredonov
had
never
seen
her
it
would
be
useless
to
ask
varvara
she
would
tell
lies
at
last
peredonov
thought
he
would
burn
the
whole
pack
let
them
all
burn
if
they
creep
into
the
cards
to
his
ruin
then
it
their
own
fault
peredonov
chose
a
time
when
varvara
was
not
at
home
the
stove
in
the
parlour
was
alight
and
he
threw
all
the
cards
into
the
stove
with
a
crackling
the
marvellous
pale
red
flowers
opened
out
they
burned
but
were
black
at
the
edges
peredonov
looked
in
horror
at
these
flaming
blossoms
the
cards
contracted
bent
over
and
moved
as
if
they
were
trying
to
escape
from
the
stove
peredonov
caught
hold
of
the
poker
and
began
to
beat
the
lighted
cards
with
it
there
was
a
shower
of
tiny
bright
sparks
on
all
sides
and
suddenly
in
a
bright
wild
riot
of
sparks
the
princess
rose
out
of
the
fire
a
little
woman
bestrewn
with
small
dying
sparks
she
wailed
piercingly
in
her
shrill
voice
and
hissed
and
spit
on
the
flames
peredonov
fell
backward
he
cried
out
in
horror
the
darkness
embraced
him
tickled
him
and
laughed
with
a
thousand
jarring
little
noises
chapter
xxvi
sasha
was
fascinated
by
liudmilla
but
something
prevented
him
from
talking
about
her
to
kokovkina
he
felt
somehow
ashamed
and
sometimes
he
came
to
be
afraid
of
her
visits
his
heart
would
feel
faint
and
his
eyebrows
contract
involuntarily
when
he
saw
her
hat
pass
quickly
under
his
window
nevertheless
he
awaited
her
with
anxiety
and
impatience
he
was
sad
when
she
did
not
come
for
a
long
time
contradictory
feelings
were
mingled
in
his
soul
feelings
dark
and
vague
morbid
because
premature
and
sweet
because
morbid
liudmilla
had
called
neither
yesterday
nor
sasha
exhausted
himself
with
waiting
and
had
already
ceased
to
expect
her
suddenly
she
came
he
grew
radiant
and
rushed
forward
to
kiss
her
hand
well
have
you
forgotten
me
he
reproached
her
i
have
seen
you
for
two
days
she
laughed
happily
and
a
sweet
languid
and
piquant
odour
of
japanese
emanated
from
her
as
if
it
came
from
her
light
hair
liudmilla
and
sasha
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
town
they
invited
kokovkina
but
she
would
not
go
how
could
an
old
woman
like
me
go
out
with
you
i
only
get
in
your
way
you
better
go
out
by
yourselves
but
we
get
into
mischief
laughed
liudmilla
the
warm
languid
air
caressed
them
and
called
to
remembrance
the
irrevocable
the
sun
as
if
diseased
burned
dimly
and
lividly
in
the
pale
tired
sky
the
dry
leaves
lay
humbly
on
the
dark
earth
dead
liudmilla
and
sasha
went
into
a
hollow
it
was
cool
refreshing
almost
damp
there
a
tender
autumn
weariness
reigned
there
within
its
shady
slopes
liudmilla
walked
in
front
she
lifted
her
skirt
she
showed
her
small
shoes
and
stockings
sasha
looked
on
the
ground
so
as
not
to
stumble
over
roots
and
saw
the
stockings
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
put
on
shoes
without
stockings
he
flushed
he
felt
giddy
if
only
i
could
fall
suddenly
before
her
he
thought
snatch
off
her
shoes
and
kiss
her
delicate
feet
liudmilla
instinctively
felt
sasha
passionate
glance
his
impatient
desire
she
laughed
and
turned
to
him
with
a
question
are
you
looking
at
my
stockings
no
i
er
mumbled
sasha
in
confusion
what
dreadful
stockings
i
got
on
said
liudmilla
laughing
and
not
listening
to
him
it
almost
looks
as
if
i
had
put
my
shoes
on
my
bare
feet
they
absolutely
do
you
think
dreadfully
ridiculous
stockings
she
turned
her
face
to
sasha
and
lifted
the
hem
of
her
dress
are
they
ridiculous
she
asked
no
they
beautiful
said
sasha
red
with
embarrassment
liudmilla
pretended
to
be
surprised
raised
her
eyebrows
and
exclaimed
and
what
do
you
know
about
beauty
liudmilla
laughed
and
walked
on
sasha
burning
with
confusion
walked
uneasily
after
her
stumbling
frequently
they
managed
to
get
through
the
hollow
they
sat
down
on
a
birch
trunk
thrown
down
by
the
wind
liudmilla
said
my
shoes
are
full
of
sand
i
ca
go
on
any
further
she
took
off
her
shoes
shook
out
the
sand
and
looked
archly
at
sasha
do
you
think
it
a
pretty
foot
she
asked
sasha
flushed
even
more
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
liudmilla
pulled
off
her
stockings
do
you
think
they
very
white
feet
she
asked
and
smiled
strangely
and
coquettishly
down
on
your
knees
kiss
them
she
said
severely
and
a
commanding
severity
showed
on
her
face
sasha
went
down
on
his
knees
quickly
and
kissed
liudmilla
feet
it
much
nicer
without
stockings
said
liudmilla
as
she
placed
her
stockings
in
her
pocket
and
stuck
her
feet
into
her
shoes
and
her
face
again
became
gay
and
calm
as
if
sasha
had
not
just
been
on
his
knees
before
her
kissing
her
naked
feet
sasha
asked
wo
you
catch
cold
dear
his
voice
sounded
tender
and
tremulous
liudmilla
laughed
what
a
notion
i
used
to
it
i
not
so
delicate
as
that
liudmilla
once
came
to
kokovkina
just
before
dusk
and
called
sasha
come
and
help
me
put
up
a
new
shelf
sasha
loved
to
knock
nails
in
and
somehow
he
had
promised
to
help
liudmilla
in
arranging
her
room
and
now
he
eagerly
consented
glad
that
there
was
an
innocent
pretext
to
go
to
liudmilla
house
and
now
the
innocent
pungent
odour
of
essence
of
blew
from
liudmilla
greenish
dress
and
gently
soothed
him
for
the
work
liudmilla
redressed
herself
behind
a
screen
and
came
out
to
sasha
in
a
short
spruce
skirt
and
short
sleeves
perfumed
with
the
pleasant
languid
pungent
japanese
oh
but
how
spruced
up
you
are
said
sasha
yes
i
am
said
liudmilla
laughing
look
my
feet
are
bare
she
said
drawling
out
her
words
in
a
way
sasha
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
you
always
spruce
well
let
begin
to
work
have
you
got
any
nails
wait
a
bit
replied
liudmilla
sit
still
a
moment
with
me
you
seem
as
if
you
had
come
on
business
and
found
it
a
bore
to
talk
to
me
sasha
flushed
and
said
tenderly
dear
liudmillotchka
i
would
like
to
sit
with
you
as
long
as
you
want
until
you
drove
me
out
but
i
got
my
lessons
to
do
liudmilla
sighed
and
said
slowly
you
getting
handsomer
sasha
sasha
reddened
laughed
and
protruded
the
end
of
his
tongue
what
a
thing
to
say
you
might
think
i
was
a
girl
from
the
way
you
talk
a
beautiful
face
but
what
kind
of
body
you
might
show
it
at
least
to
the
waist
entreated
liudmilla
caressingly
and
put
her
arm
round
his
shoulder
what
an
idea
said
sasha
ashamed
and
vexed
at
the
same
time
why
what
the
matter
asked
liudmilla
in
a
different
voice
what
have
you
got
to
hide
someone
might
come
said
sasha
who
come
in
said
liudmilla
as
gaily
and
carelessly
as
before
we
can
lock
the
door
and
then
no
one
will
come
in
liudmilla
walked
quickly
up
to
the
door
and
bolted
it
sasha
felt
that
liudmilla
was
serious
he
flushed
so
deeply
that
little
drops
of
perspiration
came
out
on
his
forehead
and
he
said
we
ought
to
do
it
liudmillotchka
stupid
why
not
asked
liudmilla
in
a
persuasive
voice
she
pulled
sasha
to
her
and
began
to
undo
his
blouse
sasha
resisted
and
caught
her
wrists
his
face
looked
frightened
and
an
equal
shame
possessed
him
and
these
emotions
made
him
feel
suddenly
weak
liudmilla
contracted
her
eyebrows
and
began
to
undress
him
determinedly
she
took
off
his
belt
and
somehow
pulled
off
his
blouse
sasha
resisted
more
and
more
desperately
they
tussled
with
each
other
about
the
room
stumbling
against
tables
and
chairs
a
pungent
scent
came
from
liudmilla
intoxicated
sasha
and
weakened
him
with
a
quick
thrust
against
his
chest
liudmilla
pushed
sasha
on
to
the
sofa
a
button
flew
off
from
the
shirt
she
was
pulling
at
liudmilla
bared
sasha
shoulder
and
began
to
pull
his
arm
out
of
the
sleeve
sasha
resisted
and
accidently
struck
liudmilla
cheek
with
his
hand
he
did
not
want
to
strike
her
but
the
blow
fell
hard
on
cheek
liudmilla
shook
staggered
her
cheeks
went
a
violent
red
but
she
did
not
let
go
of
sasha
you
wicked
boy
to
fight
she
exclaimed
in
a
choking
voice
sasha
felt
distressed
dropped
his
arms
and
looked
guiltily
at
the
white
marks
of
his
fingers
on
liudmilla
left
cheek
liudmilla
took
advantage
of
his
confusion
she
quickly
pulled
the
shirt
from
both
shoulders
to
his
elbows
sasha
recovered
himself
tried
to
get
away
from
her
but
only
made
things
worse
liudmilla
pulled
the
sleeves
off
his
arms
and
his
shirt
fell
down
to
his
waist
sasha
felt
cold
and
a
new
flood
of
shame
hard
and
pitiless
made
his
head
whirl
he
was
now
naked
to
the
waist
liudmilla
held
his
arms
tightly
and
patted
his
back
with
her
trembling
hand
looking
at
the
same
time
into
his
downcast
strangely
gleaming
eyes
under
their
eyebrows
suddenly
these
eyelashes
trembled
his
face
was
wrinkled
by
a
pitiful
childish
grimace
and
he
began
to
sob
you
wicked
girl
he
exclaimed
in
a
sobbing
voice
let
me
go
said
liudmilla
angrily
and
pushed
him
away
sasha
turned
away
drying
his
tears
on
the
palms
of
his
hands
he
felt
ashamed
because
he
was
crying
he
tried
to
hold
back
his
tears
liudmilla
looked
eagerly
at
his
naked
back
how
much
beauty
there
is
in
the
world
she
thought
people
hide
so
much
beauty
from
themselves
why
sasha
shrinking
ashamedly
with
his
naked
shoulders
tried
to
put
on
his
shirt
but
it
only
became
entangled
in
his
trembling
hands
and
he
could
not
get
his
arms
into
the
sleeves
sasha
caught
hold
of
his
blouse
let
the
shirt
remain
as
it
was
for
the
present
oh
you
afraid
for
your
property
no
i
sha
steal
it
said
liudmilla
in
a
loud
angry
voice
ringing
with
tears
she
threw
him
the
belt
impetuously
and
turned
towards
the
window
much
she
wanted
him
wrapped
up
in
his
grey
blouse
the
horrid
boy
sasha
quickly
put
on
his
blouse
somehow
arranged
his
shirt
and
looked
at
liudmilla
cautiously
indecisively
and
shamefacedly
he
saw
that
she
was
wiping
her
cheeks
with
her
fingers
he
walked
up
to
her
timidly
and
looked
into
her
face
and
the
tears
which
were
trickling
down
her
cheeks
weakened
him
into
pity
and
he
felt
no
longer
ashamed
and
angry
why
are
you
crying
dear
liudmillotchka
he
asked
quietly
and
suddenly
he
flushed
he
remembered
that
he
had
struck
her
i
hit
you
forgive
me
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
he
said
timidly
are
you
afraid
you
melt
away
you
silly
boy
that
you
wo
sit
with
your
shoulders
naked
said
liudmilla
reproachfully
or
are
you
afraid
that
you
get
sunburnt
or
your
beauty
and
innocence
be
lost
but
why
do
you
want
me
to
do
it
liudmillotchka
said
sasha
with
a
grimace
of
embarrassment
why
said
liudmilla
passionately
because
i
love
beauty
because
i
am
a
pagan
a
sinner
i
ought
to
have
been
born
in
ancient
athens
i
love
flowers
perfumes
brightly
coloured
clothes
the
naked
body
they
say
there
is
a
soul
i
do
know
i
never
seen
it
and
what
is
it
to
me
let
me
die
altogether
like
an
undine
let
me
melt
away
like
a
cloud
under
the
sun
i
love
the
body
the
strong
agile
naked
body
which
is
capable
of
enjoyment
yes
but
it
can
suffer
also
said
sasha
quietly
and
to
suffer
is
also
good
whispered
liudmilla
there
is
sweetness
in
pain
if
only
to
feel
the
body
to
see
its
nakedness
and
bodily
beauty
but
it
is
shameful
to
be
without
clothes
said
sasha
timidly
liudmilla
impetuously
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
him
she
kissed
his
hands
and
whispered
breathlessly
my
dear
my
idol
divine
boy
just
for
a
moment
only
for
a
moment
let
me
see
your
beautiful
shoulders
sasha
sighed
looked
down
flushed
and
took
off
his
blouse
awkwardly
liudmilla
caught
him
with
her
warm
hands
and
covered
his
shoulders
which
trembled
with
shame
with
kisses
do
you
see
how
obedient
i
am
said
sasha
with
a
forced
smile
trying
to
get
rid
of
his
embarrassment
with
a
jest
liudmilla
quickly
kissed
his
arms
from
the
shoulders
to
the
fingers
and
sasha
immersed
in
passionate
grave
thoughts
did
not
take
them
away
liudmilla
kisses
were
warm
with
adoration
and
it
was
as
if
her
lips
were
kissing
not
a
boy
but
a
in
a
mysterious
worship
of
the
blossoming
body
darya
and
valeria
were
standing
behind
the
door
looking
through
the
keyhole
in
turns
jostling
each
other
with
impatience
and
their
hearts
were
sick
with
a
passionate
burning
agitation
it
time
to
dress
said
sasha
at
last
liudmilla
sighed
and
with
the
same
reverent
expression
helped
him
on
with
his
clothes
so
you
a
pagan
asked
sasha
liudmilla
laughed
and
you
she
asked
what
a
question
said
sasha
with
assurance
i
learned
the
whole
catechism
liudmilla
laughed
loudly
sasha
looked
at
her
smiling
and
asked
if
you
a
pagan
why
do
you
go
to
church
liudmilla
ceased
laughing
and
reflected
well
she
said
one
has
to
pray
one
has
to
pray
to
weep
to
burn
a
candle
and
do
something
for
the
dead
and
i
love
it
all
the
candles
the
the
incense
the
vestments
the
singing
if
the
singers
are
good
the
ikons
with
their
trimmings
and
ribbons
yes
all
that
is
beautiful
and
i
also
love
him
you
know
the
crucified
one
liudmilla
pronounced
the
last
words
very
quietly
almost
in
a
whisper
blushed
like
a
guilty
person
and
cast
down
her
eyes
do
you
know
i
sometimes
dream
of
him
on
the
cross
and
there
are
drops
of
blood
on
his
body
from
that
time
on
liudmilla
more
than
once
took
sasha
to
her
room
and
began
to
unbutton
his
blouse
at
first
he
was
ashamed
to
tears
but
he
soon
got
used
to
it
and
already
he
looked
clearly
and
calmly
when
liudmilla
bared
his
shoulders
and
caressed
his
back
in
the
end
he
would
take
off
his
clothes
himself
and
liudmilla
found
it
very
pleasant
to
hold
him
on
her
knees
kissing
him
sasha
was
alone
at
home
he
thought
of
liudmilla
and
of
his
naked
shoulders
under
her
passionate
glances
and
what
does
she
want
he
thought
and
suddenly
he
grew
livid
and
his
heart
beat
rapidly
a
tumultuous
happiness
seized
him
he
turned
several
somersaults
threw
himself
on
the
floor
jumped
on
the
furniture
a
thousand
absurd
movements
threw
him
from
one
corner
to
another
and
his
gay
clear
laughter
resounded
through
the
house
kokovkina
who
had
returned
home
heard
this
extraordinary
din
and
went
into
sasha
room
she
stood
on
the
threshold
in
perplexity
shaking
her
head
why
are
you
making
such
a
row
sashenka
she
said
you
might
have
an
excuse
to
do
it
with
other
boys
but
you
alone
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
young
man
you
not
a
child
any
longer
sasha
stood
still
and
in
his
embarrassment
seemed
to
lose
the
use
of
his
hands
his
whole
body
trembled
with
excitement
once
kokovkina
came
home
and
found
liudmilla
there
she
was
giving
sasha
sweets
you
spoiling
him
said
kokovkina
affectionately
he
loves
sweets
yes
and
yet
he
calls
me
a
wicked
girl
complained
liudmilla
oh
sashenka
how
could
you
said
kokovkina
reproachfully
why
did
you
say
that
she
teasing
me
said
sasha
falteringly
he
looked
at
liudmilla
with
vexation
and
flushed
liudmilla
laughed
sasha
whispered
to
her
do
be
rude
sashenka
said
kokovkina
it
is
nice
sasha
glanced
at
liudmilla
with
a
smile
and
said
quietly
well
i
wo
do
it
again
each
time
that
sasha
came
now
liudmilla
locked
the
door
and
dressed
him
up
in
various
costumes
their
sweet
shame
was
dressed
up
in
laughter
and
jokes
sometimes
liudmilla
pulled
sasha
into
corsets
and
dressed
him
in
one
of
her
gowns
in
the
dress
sasha
full
arms
and
round
shoulders
looked
very
beautiful
his
skin
was
yellowish
but
of
an
even
soft
complexion
a
rare
occurrence
liudmilla
skirt
sleeves
and
stockings
were
all
becoming
to
sasha
dressed
entirely
in
woman
clothes
sasha
sat
down
obediently
and
waved
a
fan
in
this
costume
he
really
resembled
a
girl
and
he
tried
to
behave
like
one
there
was
only
one
flaw
sasha
short
hair
liudmilla
thought
it
would
be
ugly
to
put
a
wig
on
sasha
hair
or
to
tie
on
a
plait
of
hair
liudmilla
taught
sasha
to
curtsy
he
did
this
awkwardly
and
shyly
at
first
but
he
was
graceful
in
spite
of
his
boyish
angularity
blushing
and
laughing
he
learned
diligently
to
curtsy
and
he
coquetted
furiously
sometimes
liudmilla
seized
his
bare
graceful
arms
and
kissed
them
sasha
did
not
resist
and
looked
laughingly
at
liudmilla
sometimes
he
held
out
his
hands
to
her
lips
and
said
kiss
them
but
he
liked
most
of
all
other
costumes
which
liudmilla
herself
made
particularly
the
dress
of
a
with
bare
legs
the
tunic
of
a
athenian
boy
liudmilla
would
dress
him
up
and
admire
him
but
she
herself
would
go
pale
and
look
melancholy
sasha
was
sitting
on
liudmilla
bed
playing
with
the
folds
of
his
tunic
and
dangling
his
naked
legs
liudmilla
stood
in
front
of
him
and
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
happiness
and
surprise
how
stupid
you
are
said
sasha
there
so
much
happiness
in
my
stupidity
said
liudmilla
pale
and
crying
and
kissing
sasha
hands
why
are
you
crying
asked
sasha
smiling
unconcernedly
my
heart
is
stung
with
happiness
my
breast
is
pierced
with
seven
swords
of
happiness
how
can
i
help
crying
you
are
a
little
fool
really
you
a
little
fool
said
sasha
with
a
laugh
and
you
wise
replied
liudmilla
in
sudden
vexation
and
sighed
wiping
her
tears
away
understand
little
stupid
she
said
in
a
quiet
persuasive
voice
that
happiness
and
wisdom
are
only
to
be
found
in
madness
yes
yes
said
sasha
incredulously
you
must
forget
and
forget
yourself
and
then
you
understand
everything
whispered
liudmilla
in
your
opinion
do
wise
men
think
and
what
else
should
they
do
they
simply
know
it
given
to
them
at
once
they
only
have
to
look
and
everything
opened
to
them
the
autumn
evening
dragged
along
quietly
a
barely
audible
rustle
came
now
and
then
through
the
window
when
the
wind
moved
the
tree
branches
sasha
and
liudmilla
were
alone
liudmilla
had
dressed
him
up
as
a
in
a
costume
of
thin
blue
canvas
he
was
lying
on
a
low
couch
and
she
sat
on
the
floor
by
his
bare
feet
herself
and
in
a
chemise
she
sprinkled
sasha
clothes
and
body
with
perfume
a
dense
grassy
smell
like
the
motionless
odour
of
a
strangely
blossoming
valley
locked
in
hills
large
bright
roman
pearls
sparkled
on
liudmilla
neck
and
golden
figured
bracelets
rang
on
her
arms
her
body
was
scented
with
orris
it
was
an
overpowering
fleshly
provoking
perfume
bringing
drowsiness
and
langour
created
from
the
distillations
of
slow
waters
she
languished
and
sighed
looking
at
his
smooth
face
at
his
eyelashes
and
at
his
eyes
she
laid
her
head
on
his
bare
knees
and
her
bright
hair
caressed
his
smooth
skin
she
kissed
his
body
and
her
head
whirled
from
the
strange
aroma
mingling
with
the
scent
of
young
flesh
sasha
lay
there
and
smiled
a
quiet
indefinite
smile
a
vague
desire
awoke
in
him
and
sweetly
tormented
him
and
when
liudmilla
kissed
his
knees
and
feet
the
kisses
aroused
languorous
musings
in
him
he
wanted
to
do
something
something
pleasant
or
painful
gentle
or
shameful
but
what
to
kiss
her
feet
or
to
beat
her
long
hard
with
long
flexible
twigs
so
that
she
would
laugh
with
joy
or
cry
with
pain
perhaps
she
desired
one
or
the
other
but
that
was
not
enough
what
then
did
she
want
here
they
were
both
and
with
their
freed
flesh
was
bound
desire
and
a
restraining
shame
but
what
then
was
the
mystery
of
the
flesh
and
how
then
could
he
bring
his
blood
and
his
body
as
an
exquisite
sacrifice
to
her
desires
and
to
his
shame
and
liudmilla
languished
and
stirred
at
his
feet
going
pale
from
impossible
desires
now
growing
cold
she
whispered
passionately
am
i
not
beautiful
have
i
burning
eyes
have
i
wonderful
hair
then
caress
me
take
me
close
to
you
tear
off
my
bracelets
pull
off
my
necklace
sasha
felt
terrified
and
impossible
desires
tormented
him
agonisingly
chapter
xxvii
peredonov
awoke
in
the
morning
someone
was
looking
at
him
with
huge
cloudy
eyes
was
it
pilnikov
peredonov
walked
up
to
the
window
and
spat
on
the
evil
apparition
everything
seemed
bewitched
the
wild
nedotikomka
squealed
and
the
people
and
the
beasts
looked
malignantly
and
craftily
at
peredonov
everything
was
hostile
to
him
he
was
one
against
all
during
lessons
at
the
peredonov
slandered
his
colleagues
the
the
parents
and
the
pupils
the
students
listened
to
him
in
astonishment
some
vulgarians
by
nature
truckled
to
peredonov
and
showed
their
sympathy
with
him
others
remained
gravely
silent
or
defended
their
parents
hotly
when
peredonov
assailed
them
peredonov
looked
morosely
and
timorously
on
these
boys
and
avoided
them
muttering
something
to
himself
at
some
of
the
lessons
peredonov
amused
his
pupils
by
absurd
comments
they
were
reading
the
lines
from
pushkin
the
sun
rises
in
a
cold
mist
the
are
silent
the
wolf
goes
out
on
the
road
with
his
hungry
mate
let
us
stop
here
said
peredonov
this
needs
to
be
thoroughly
understood
there
an
allegory
concealed
here
wolves
go
in
pairs
that
is
the
wolf
with
his
hungry
mate
the
wolf
is
fed
but
she
is
hungry
the
wife
should
always
eat
after
the
husband
the
wife
should
be
subject
to
the
husband
in
everything
pilnikov
was
in
a
cheerful
mood
he
smiled
and
looked
at
peredonov
with
his
elusively
fine
dark
eyes
sasha
face
annoyed
and
yet
attracted
peredonov
the
cursed
boy
bewitched
him
with
his
artful
smile
was
it
really
a
boy
or
perhaps
there
were
two
of
them
a
brother
and
a
sister
but
it
was
difficult
to
tell
who
was
there
or
perhaps
it
was
even
possible
for
him
to
change
himself
from
a
boy
into
a
girl
there
must
be
some
reason
for
his
being
so
clean
when
he
changed
his
form
he
splashed
in
magical
waters
otherwise
how
could
he
transform
himself
and
he
always
smelt
of
scents
what
have
you
scented
yourself
with
pilnikov
asked
peredonov
was
it
patchkouli
the
boys
laughed
sasha
grew
red
at
the
insult
but
said
nothing
peredonov
could
not
understand
the
disinterested
desire
to
please
not
to
be
repulsive
to
others
every
such
manifestation
even
on
the
part
of
a
boy
he
considered
a
design
against
himself
he
who
was
neatly
dressed
evidently
was
trying
to
gain
peredonov
favour
otherwise
why
should
he
go
to
so
much
trouble
neatness
and
cleanliness
were
repulsive
to
peredonov
perfumes
seemed
to
him
to
be
bad
smells
he
preferred
the
stink
of
a
manured
field
which
he
considered
good
for
the
health
to
all
the
perfumes
of
the
world
to
be
neatly
dressed
washed
clean
all
this
required
time
and
labour
and
the
thought
of
labour
depressed
and
dejected
peredonov
how
good
it
would
be
to
do
nothing
and
only
eat
drink
and
sleep
sasha
companions
teased
him
about
his
scenting
himself
with
patchkouli
and
about
liudmillotchka
being
in
love
with
him
this
angered
him
and
he
replied
hotly
that
it
was
not
true
she
was
not
in
love
with
him
that
it
was
all
an
invention
of
peredonov
who
had
paid
court
to
liudmilla
and
had
been
snubbed
this
was
why
he
was
angry
with
her
and
was
spreading
all
sorts
of
evil
rumours
about
her
his
companions
believed
him
they
knew
peredonov
but
they
did
not
stop
teasing
sasha
it
was
such
a
pleasure
to
tease
someone
peredonov
persisted
in
telling
everyone
about
pilnikov
viciousness
he
got
himself
mixed
up
badly
with
liudmillka
he
said
the
townspeople
gossiped
of
liudmilla
affection
for
the
schoolboy
in
a
greatly
exaggerated
way
and
with
stupid
unseemly
details
but
there
were
only
a
few
who
believed
this
peredonov
had
overdone
it
people
of
whom
there
are
not
a
few
in
our
town
asked
liudmilla
what
made
you
fall
in
love
with
a
small
boy
it
an
insult
to
the
cavaliers
of
our
town
liudmilla
laughed
and
said
nonsense
the
townspeople
regarded
sasha
with
ugly
curiosity
sasha
sometimes
reproached
liudmilla
because
he
was
teased
about
her
it
even
happened
that
he
slapped
her
because
she
laughed
so
loudly
to
put
an
end
to
this
stupid
gossip
and
to
save
liudmilla
from
unpleasant
scandal
all
the
routilovs
and
their
numerous
friends
and
relatives
acted
against
peredonov
and
persuaded
people
that
all
his
tales
were
the
inventions
of
a
madman
peredonov
wild
actions
compelled
many
people
to
believe
this
explanation
at
the
same
time
many
denunciations
of
peredonov
were
sent
to
the
director
of
the
school
district
from
the
district
headquarters
they
sent
an
enquiry
to
the
khripatch
referred
them
to
his
previous
reports
and
added
that
the
further
presence
of
peredonov
in
the
was
a
positive
danger
as
his
mental
disease
was
visibly
increasing
peredonov
was
now
entirely
governed
by
wild
illusions
the
world
was
screened
off
from
him
by
apparitions
his
vacant
dull
eyes
wandered
and
were
unable
to
rest
on
objects
as
if
he
wanted
to
look
beyond
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
objective
world
and
as
if
he
sought
for
chinks
of
light
between
them
when
he
was
alone
he
talked
to
himself
and
shouted
senseless
threats
at
some
unknown
person
i
will
kill
you
i
will
cut
your
throat
i
caulk
you
up
varvara
listened
with
a
smile
make
all
the
row
you
want
she
thought
malignantly
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
only
his
rage
he
must
have
guessed
that
they
had
fooled
him
and
was
angry
he
would
go
out
of
his
mind
a
fool
has
no
mind
to
go
out
of
and
even
if
he
did
well
madness
cheers
the
stupid
do
you
know
ardalyon
borisitch
said
khripatch
you
look
very
unwell
i
have
a
headache
said
peredonov
morosely
do
you
know
my
friend
continued
the
in
a
cautious
voice
i
would
advise
you
not
to
come
to
the
at
present
you
ought
to
attend
to
yourself
to
give
a
little
attention
to
your
nerves
which
are
obviously
a
little
unstrung
not
come
to
the
of
course
thought
peredonov
that
the
best
thing
to
do
why
did
i
think
of
it
before
i
look
ill
and
stay
at
home
and
see
what
will
come
of
it
yes
yes
i
better
not
come
i
am
rather
unwell
he
said
eagerly
to
khripatch
at
the
same
time
khripatch
wrote
again
to
the
head
office
of
the
district
and
awaited
from
day
to
day
the
appointment
of
the
physicians
for
an
examination
of
peredonov
but
the
officials
were
very
leisurely
that
was
because
they
were
officials
peredonov
did
not
go
to
the
and
awaited
something
during
the
last
few
days
he
had
clung
more
and
more
to
volodin
directly
he
opened
his
eyes
in
the
morning
peredonov
thought
gloomily
of
volodin
where
was
he
now
was
he
up
to
something
sometimes
he
had
visions
of
volodin
clouds
floated
in
the
sky
like
a
flock
of
sheep
and
volodin
ran
among
them
bleating
with
laughter
with
a
bowler
hat
on
his
head
sometimes
he
floated
by
in
the
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimneys
making
monstrous
grimaces
and
leaping
in
the
air
volodin
thought
and
told
everyone
with
pride
that
peredonov
had
recently
taken
a
great
fancy
to
him
that
peredonov
simply
could
not
live
without
him
varvara
has
fooled
him
explained
volodin
and
he
sees
that
i
alone
am
his
faithful
friend
that
why
he
sticks
to
me
when
peredonov
went
out
of
his
house
to
look
for
volodin
the
other
met
him
on
the
way
in
his
bowler
hat
with
his
stick
jumping
along
gaily
and
laughing
his
bleating
laugh
why
do
you
always
wear
a
bowler
peredonov
once
asked
him
well
why
should
i
wear
a
bowler
ardalyon
borisitch
replied
volodin
gaily
and
shrewdly
it
modest
and
becoming
i
not
allowed
to
wear
a
cap
with
a
badge
and
as
for
a
let
the
aristocrats
stick
to
it
it
does
become
us
you
roast
in
your
bowler
said
peredonov
morosely
volodin
sniggered
they
went
to
peredonov
house
one
has
to
do
so
much
walking
complained
peredonov
it
good
to
take
exercise
ardalyon
borisitch
said
volodin
persuasively
you
work
you
take
a
walk
you
eat
your
meals
and
you
healthy
well
yes
said
peredonov
do
you
think
that
in
two
or
three
hundred
years
from
now
people
will
have
to
work
what
else
is
there
to
do
if
you
do
work
you
have
no
bread
to
eat
you
buy
bread
with
money
and
you
have
to
earn
the
money
but
i
do
want
bread
but
there
would
be
any
rolls
or
tarts
either
said
volodin
with
a
snigger
no
one
would
have
any
money
to
buy
vodka
and
there
be
anything
to
make
liqueurs
of
no
the
people
themselves
wo
work
said
peredonov
there
be
machines
for
everything
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
turn
a
handle
like
an
and
it
ready
but
it
would
be
a
bore
to
turn
it
long
volodin
lapsed
into
thought
lowered
his
head
stuck
out
his
lips
and
said
reflectively
yes
that
would
be
very
good
only
none
of
us
will
live
to
see
it
peredonov
looked
at
him
malignantly
and
grumbled
you
mean
you
wo
live
to
see
it
but
i
shall
may
god
grant
you
said
volodin
gaily
to
live
two
hundred
years
and
then
to
crawl
on
all
fours
for
three
hundred
peredonov
no
longer
pronounced
exorcisms
let
the
worst
come
he
would
triumph
over
everything
he
had
only
to
be
on
his
guard
and
not
yield
once
at
home
sitting
in
the
and
drinking
with
volodin
peredonov
told
him
about
the
princess
the
princess
according
to
peredonov
grew
more
decrepit
and
terrible
from
day
to
day
yellow
wrinkled
bent
tusked
evil
she
incessantly
haunted
peredonov
she
two
hundred
years
old
said
peredonov
looking
strangely
and
gloomily
before
him
and
she
wants
me
to
make
it
up
with
her
again
until
then
she
wo
give
me
a
job
she
certainly
wants
a
good
deal
said
volodin
shaking
his
head
the
old
hag
peredonov
brooded
over
murder
he
said
to
volodin
frowning
savagely
i
got
one
hidden
behind
the
and
i
going
to
kill
another
under
the
floor
but
volodin
was
not
afraid
and
kept
on
sniggering
do
you
smell
the
stench
from
behind
the
asked
peredonov
no
i
do
smell
it
said
volodin
still
sniggering
and
grimacing
your
nose
is
blocked
up
said
peredonov
no
wonder
it
gone
red
it
rotting
there
behind
the
a
beetle
exclaimed
varvara
with
a
boisterous
laugh
peredonov
looked
dull
and
grave
peredonov
became
more
and
more
engulfed
in
his
madness
and
began
to
write
denunciations
against
the
court
cards
the
nedotikomka
the
ram
that
he
the
ram
was
an
imposter
who
representing
volodin
was
aiming
for
a
high
position
but
was
in
reality
only
a
ram
against
the
forest
destroyers
who
cut
down
the
birches
so
that
there
were
no
twigs
for
turkish
baths
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
bring
up
children
because
they
left
only
the
aspens
and
what
use
were
they
when
he
met
the
schoolboys
in
the
street
peredonov
frightened
the
youngest
and
amused
the
older
ones
with
his
shameless
and
ridiculous
words
the
older
ones
walked
after
him
in
a
crowd
scattering
however
when
they
saw
one
of
the
other
masters
the
younger
ones
ran
away
from
him
of
their
own
accord
peredonov
saw
enchantments
and
sorceries
in
everything
his
hallucinations
terrified
him
and
forced
from
him
senseless
moans
and
squeals
the
nedotikomka
appeared
to
him
now
now
flaming
it
groaned
and
it
bellowed
and
its
bellowing
split
his
head
with
an
unendurable
pain
the
cat
grew
to
terrible
dimensions
stamped
with
high
boots
and
turned
into
a
huge
red
bewhiskered
person
a
double
meaning
is
implied
in
peredonov
use
of
the
word
as
the
word
patchkatsya
means
to
soil
oneself
a
musical
instrument

sasha
left
home
after
lunch
and
did
not
return
at
the
appointed
time
at
seven
kokovkina
was
worried
may
god
preserve
him
from
meeting
one
of
his
masters
in
the
street
at
a
forbidden
time
he
be
punished
and
i
shall
feel
uncomfortable
she
thought
quiet
boys
always
lived
at
her
house
and
did
not
wander
about
at
night
kokovkina
went
to
look
for
sasha
where
else
could
he
be
except
at
the
routilovs
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
liudmilla
that
evening
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
door
kokovkina
entered
and
what
did
she
see
sasha
stood
before
the
mirror
in
a
woman
dress
waving
a
fan
liudmilla
was
laughing
and
arranging
ribbons
at
his
belt
good
heavens
exclaimed
kokovkina
in
horror
what
this
i
was
worried
and
came
to
look
for
him
and
here
he
is
acting
a
comedy
what
a
disgrace
for
him
to
dress
himself
in
a
skirt
and
are
you
ashamed
liudmilla
platonovna
liudmilla
was
for
a
moment
very
embarrassed
because
of
the
suddenness
of
the
thing
but
soon
recovered
herself
she
embraced
kokovkina
with
a
laugh
sat
her
in
a
chair
and
invented
an
explanation
we
are
going
to
have
a
play
at
home
i
shall
be
a
boy
and
he
be
a
girl
and
it
be
very
amusing
sasha
stood
flushed
and
terrified
with
tears
in
his
eyes
what
nonsense
said
kokovkina
angrily
he
ought
to
be
studying
his
lessons
and
not
waste
his
time
what
will
you
think
of
next
dress
yourself
at
once
aleksandr
and
march
home
with
me
liudmilla
laughed
loudly
and
gaily
and
kissed
kokovkina
and
the
old
woman
thought
that
the
happy
girl
was
very
and
that
sasha
obediently
carried
out
all
her
whims
liudmilla
laughter
at
this
moment
showed
this
to
be
only
a
simple
childish
prank
for
which
they
would
only
have
to
be
lectured
a
little
and
kokovkina
grumbled
assuming
an
angry
face
but
her
feelings
were
already
calmed
down
sasha
quickly
redressed
himself
behind
the
screen
where
bed
stood
kokovkina
took
him
off
and
scolded
him
all
the
way
home
sasha
felt
ashamed
and
frightened
and
did
not
attempt
to
justify
himself
and
what
will
happen
at
home
he
thought
timidly
at
home
kokovkina
treated
him
sternly
for
the
first
time
she
ordered
him
to
get
down
on
his
knees
but
sasha
had
barely
been
in
that
position
for
a
few
moments
when
kokovkina
softened
by
his
repentant
face
and
silent
tears
released
him
she
said
grumblingly
what
a
little
you
are
your
perfumes
can
be
smelt
a
mile
off
sasha
gracefully
bent
over
and
kissed
her
hand
and
the
courtesy
of
the
punished
boy
touched
her
even
more
in
the
meantime
a
storm
was
gathering
over
sasha
varvara
and
grushina
composed
and
sent
to
khripatch
an
anonymous
letter
to
the
effect
that
the
schoolboy
pilnikov
had
been
fascinated
by
the
routilov
girl
that
he
spent
whole
evenings
with
her
rather
questionably
khripatch
collected
a
recent
conversation
one
evening
at
the
house
of
the
marshal
of
the
nobility
someone
had
thrown
out
an
insinuation
which
no
one
had
taken
up
about
a
girl
who
was
in
love
with
a
schoolboy
the
conversation
had
immediately
passed
to
other
subjects
in
presence
everyone
acting
on
the
unwritten
law
of
people
accustomed
to
good
society
considered
this
an
extremely
awkward
theme
for
discussion
and
they
assumed
that
this
topic
was
not
to
be
mentioned
in
the
presence
of
women
and
that
the
rumour
itself
was
trivial
and
very
unlikely
khripatch
of
course
had
noticed
this
but
he
was
not
so
naive
as
to
ask
anyone
he
was
fully
confident
that
he
would
know
all
about
it
soon
that
all
information
came
of
itself
in
one
way
or
another
but
always
in
good
season
well
here
was
a
letter
which
contained
the
expected
information
khripatch
did
not
for
a
moment
believe
that
pilnikov
was
guilty
and
that
his
relations
with
liudmilla
were
improper
this
he
thought
is
one
of
peredonov
stupid
inventions
and
is
nourished
by
grushina
envy
and
spitefulness
but
this
letter
shows
that
certain
undesirable
rumours
are
current
which
might
cast
a
reflection
on
the
good
name
of
the
entrusted
to
me
and
therefore
measures
must
be
taken
first
of
all
khripatch
invited
kokovkina
to
discuss
with
him
the
circumstances
which
had
helped
to
give
rise
to
these
rumours
kokovkina
already
knew
what
was
the
trouble
she
had
been
informed
even
more
bluntly
than
the
grushina
had
waited
for
her
in
the
street
entered
into
conversation
and
told
her
that
liudmilla
had
already
managed
to
corrupt
sasha
kokovkina
was
dumbfounded
when
she
got
home
she
showered
reproaches
upon
sasha
she
was
all
the
more
vexed
because
this
had
happened
almost
before
her
eyes
and
because
sasha
had
gone
to
the
routilovs
with
her
knowledge
sasha
pretended
not
to
understand
anything
and
he
asked
what
have
i
done
wrong
kokovkina
was
at
a
loss
for
a
moment
what
wrong
do
you
know
yourself
did
i
find
you
in
a
skirt
not
long
ago
have
you
forgotten
you
shameless
boy
yes
but
what
was
especially
wrong
with
that
and
did
you
punish
me
for
it
it
was
as
if
i
stolen
the
skirt
hark
how
he
talks
said
kokovkina
in
a
distraught
way
i
punished
you
but
not
enough
apparently
well
punish
me
again
said
sasha
defiantly
with
the
look
of
a
person
unjustly
treated
you
forgave
me
yourself
and
now
it
enough
i
did
ask
you
to
forgive
me
i
would
have
knelt
all
the
evening
and
what
the
good
of
scolding
me
all
the
time
yes
and
everyone
in
town
is
talking
about
you
and
your
liudmillotchka
and
what
are
they
saying
asked
sasha
in
an
innocently
inquisitive
tone
of
voice
kokovkina
was
again
at
a
loss
it
clear
enough
what
they
saying
you
know
perfectly
well
what
might
be
said
of
you
very
little
that
good
you
may
be
sure
up
to
mischief
with
your
liudmillotchka
that
what
they
saying
well
i
wo
get
up
to
mischief
again
sasha
promised
as
calmly
as
if
the
conversation
concerned
a
game
of
touch
he
assumed
an
expression
of
innocence
but
his
heart
was
heavy
he
asked
kokovkina
what
they
were
saying
and
was
afraid
that
he
would
hear
it
was
something
unpleasant
what
could
they
be
saying
liudmillotchka
room
faced
the
garden
it
could
not
be
seen
from
the
street
besides
liudmillotchka
always
lowered
the
blinds
and
if
anyone
had
looked
in
what
could
they
say
perhaps
something
annoying
and
insulting
or
perhaps
they
were
only
saying
that
he
often
went
there
and
here
on
the
next
day
kokovkina
received
an
invitation
to
go
and
see
the
the
old
woman
was
distraught
she
did
not
even
mention
it
to
sasha
but
at
the
appointed
time
went
quickly
on
her
errand
khripatch
kindly
and
gently
informed
her
of
the
anonymous
letter
he
had
received
she
began
to
cry
be
calm
we
not
accusing
you
of
anything
said
khripatch
we
know
you
too
well
of
course
you
have
to
look
after
him
a
little
more
rigorously
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
now
what
actually
has
taken
place
kokovkina
came
home
with
more
reproaches
for
sasha
i
shall
write
to
your
aunt
she
said
crying
i
have
done
anything
let
aunt
come
i
not
afraid
said
sasha
and
he
began
to
cry
also
the
next
day
khripatch
asked
sasha
to
come
and
see
him
and
asked
him
dryly
and
sternly
i
would
like
to
know
what
sort
of
an
acquaintance
you
have
been
cultivating
in
the
town
sasha
looked
at
the
with
deceptive
innocence
and
tranquil
eyes
what
sort
of
an
acquaintance
he
said
olga
vassilyevna
knows
that
i
only
go
to
my
companions
and
to
the
routilovs
yes
precisely
continued
khripatch
what
do
you
do
at
the
routilovs
nothing
in
particular
replied
sasha
with
the
same
innocent
look
we
mostly
read
the
routilov
sisters
are
fond
of
poetry
and
i
always
home
at
seven
perhaps
not
always
asked
khripatch
fixing
on
sasha
a
glance
which
he
tried
to
make
piercing
yes
i
was
late
once
said
sasha
with
the
calm
frankness
of
an
innocent
boy
and
olga
vassilyevna
gave
it
to
me
but
after
that
i
was
late
again
khripatch
was
silent
sasha
calm
answers
left
him
rather
nonplussed
in
any
case
it
would
be
necessary
to
give
him
a
reprimand
but
how
and
for
what
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
suggest
to
the
boy
unwholesome
thoughts
which
so
khripatch
believed
he
had
not
had
before
or
that
he
might
offend
the
boy
but
he
wanted
to
remove
any
unpleasantness
which
might
in
the
future
come
from
this
acquaintance
khripatch
thought
that
an
educator
business
was
a
very
difficult
and
responsible
matter
especially
if
you
have
the
honour
of
being
the
head
of
an
educational
establishment
this
difficult
responsible
business
of
an
educator
this
banal
definition
gave
wings
to
khripatch
almost
drooping
thoughts
he
began
to
talk
quickly
precisely
and
uninterestingly
sasha
caught
only
a
phrase
here
and
there
your
first
duty
as
a
pupil
is
to
learn
you
should
not
be
attracted
by
society
however
pleasant
and
irreproachable
in
any
case
i
should
say
that
the
society
of
boys
of
your
own
age
would
be
preferable
you
must
keep
high
your
own
reputation
and
that
of
your
educational
institution
finally
i
may
say
candidly
that
i
have
reasons
to
suppose
that
your
relations
with
young
ladies
have
a
character
of
great
freedom
unpermissible
at
your
age
and
altogether
not
in
accordance
with
generally
accepted
rules
of
propriety
sasha
began
to
cry
he
felt
distressed
that
anyone
could
think
and
talk
of
dear
liudmillotchka
as
of
a
person
with
whom
you
could
take
improper
liberties
upon
my
word
there
was
nothing
wrong
he
assured
the
we
only
read
went
for
walks
and
played
well
we
ran
sometimes
we
did
nothing
else
khripatch
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
said
in
a
dry
voice
which
he
tried
to
make
hearty
listen
pilnikov
why
should
he
sometimes
call
this
boy
sasha
was
it
because
it
was
not
official
and
there
was
as
yet
no
ministerial
circular
i
believe
you
when
you
say
that
nothing
wrong
has
happened
but
all
the
same
you
had
better
put
an
end
to
your
frequent
visits
believe
me
it
would
be
better
i
speak
to
you
not
only
as
your
schoolmaster
and
official
head
but
also
as
your
friend
nothing
remained
for
sasha
to
do
but
to
make
his
bow
to
thank
the
and
to
obey
and
sasha
from
this
time
on
went
to
liudmilla
only
for
five
or
ten
minutes
at
a
time
but
still
he
tried
to
go
every
day
it
vexed
him
to
be
able
to
make
only
such
short
visits
and
he
vented
his
annoyance
on
liudmilla
herself
he
often
called
her
now
liudmillka
silly
fool
balaam
ass
and
he
even
struck
her
but
liudmilla
only
laughed
at
it
all
the
report
spread
about
town
that
the
actors
of
the
local
theatre
were
going
to
organise
a
masked
ball
at
the
club
house
with
prizes
for
the
best
man
and
the
best
woman
costumes
there
were
exaggerated
rumours
about
the
prize
it
was
said
that
the
lady
would
receive
a
cow
and
the
man
a
bicycle
these
rumours
excited
the
town
people
each
one
was
eager
to
win
the
prizes
were
so
considerable
the
costumes
were
prepared
in
haste
no
expense
was
spared
people
hid
their
costumes
even
from
their
nearest
friends
so
that
their
brilliant
idea
might
not
be
stolen
when
the
printed
announcement
of
the
masked
ball
appeared
huge
bills
pasted
on
fences
and
sent
out
to
important
tradesmen
it
turned
out
that
they
were
not
giving
a
cow
and
a
bicycle
but
only
a
fan
to
the
lady
and
an
album
to
the
man
this
vexed
and
disenchanted
those
who
had
been
preparing
for
the
ball
they
began
to
grumble
they
said
it
a
waste
of
money
it
simply
ridiculous
such
prizes
they
ought
to
have
let
us
know
at
once
it
only
in
our
town
that
the
public
can
be
treated
like
this
nevertheless
all
the
preparations
went
on
it
was
much
of
a
prize
but
still
it
would
be
flattering
to
win
it
the
amount
of
the
prize
did
not
interest
either
darya
or
liudmilla
much
they
wanted
a
cow
what
a
rarity
a
fan
was
and
who
was
going
to
award
the
prizes
we
know
what
taste
these
judges
have
but
both
sisters
were
captivated
by
the
idea
of
sending
sasha
to
the
masked
ball
in
a
woman
dress
to
fool
the
whole
town
and
to
arrange
so
that
the
lady
prize
should
go
to
him
valeria
tired
to
look
as
if
she
agreed
to
it
it
was
liudmillotchka
little
friend
he
was
not
coming
to
see
her
but
she
could
not
decide
to
quarrel
with
her
two
elder
sisters
she
only
said
with
a
contemptuous
smile
he
wo
dare
well
said
darya
we
shall
dress
him
up
so
that
no
one
will
recognise
him
and
when
the
sisters
told
sasha
about
their
project
and
liudmillotchka
said
to
him
we
will
dress
you
up
as
a
girl
sasha
jumped
up
and
down
and
shouted
with
joy
he
was
delighted
with
the
idea
especially
as
no
one
would
know
it
would
be
fine
to
fool
everyone
they
decided
at
once
that
they
would
dress
sasha
as
a
geisha
the
sisters
kept
their
idea
in
the
strictest
secrecy
and
did
not
even
tell
larissa
or
their
brother
liudmilla
herself
made
the
costume
from
the
design
on
the
label
of
korilopsis
it
was
a
long
full
dress
of
yellow
silk
on
red
velvet
she
sewed
a
bright
pattern
on
the
dress
consisting
of
large
flowers
of
fantastic
shape
the
girls
made
a
fan
out
of
thin
japanese
paper
with
figures
on
bamboo
sticks
and
a
parasol
out
of
thin
rose
silk
with
a
bamboo
handle
they
bought
rose
coloured
stockings
and
wooden
slippers
with
little
ridges
underneath
the
artist
liudmilla
painted
a
geisha
mask
it
was
a
yellowish
but
agreeable
thin
face
with
a
slight
motionless
smile
oblique
eyes
and
a
small
narrow
mouth
they
had
only
to
get
the
wig
from
peterburg
with
smooth
arranged
hair
time
was
needed
to
fit
the
costume
and
sasha
could
only
come
in
snatches
and
not
every
day
but
they
managed
it
sasha
ran
off
at
night
by
way
of
the
window
when
kokovkina
was
asleep
it
went
off
successfully
varvara
also
was
preparing
for
the
masked
ball
she
brought
a
stupid
looking
mask
and
she
did
worry
about
costume
she
dressed
herself
as
a
cook
she
hung
a
skimmer
at
her
waist
and
put
a
white
cap
on
her
head
her
arms
were
bare
to
the
elbow
and
very
heavily
rouged
a
cook
straight
from
the
hearth
and
the
costume
was
ready
if
she
got
the
prize
so
much
the
better
if
she
did
she
could
get
on
without
it
grushina
dressed
herself
as
diana
varvara
laughed
and
asked
are
you
going
to
put
on
a
collar
why
a
collar
asked
grushina
in
astonishment
i
thought
you
were
going
to
dress
up
as
the
dog
dianka
explained
varvara
what
a
notion
replied
grushina
with
a
laugh
not
dianka
but
the
goddess
diana
varvara
and
grushina
dressed
for
the
ball
at
grushina
house
grushina
costume
was
excessively
scanty
bare
arms
and
shoulders
bare
neck
bare
chest
her
legs
bare
to
the
knee
light
slippers
and
a
light
dress
of
linen
with
a
red
border
against
the
white
flesh
it
was
quite
a
short
dress
but
broad
with
many
folds
varvara
said
with
a
smile
you
are
grushina
replied
with
a
vulgar
wink
it
attract
the
boys
but
why
so
many
folds
asked
varvara
i
can
fill
them
with
sweets
for
my
devilkins
explained
grushina
all
of
grushina
that
was
so
boldly
displayed
was
handsome
but
what
contradictions
on
her
skin
were
her
manners
were
coarse
and
her
talk
was
insufferably
banal
once
more
abused
bodily
beauty
peredonov
thought
that
the
masked
ball
was
planned
on
purpose
to
trap
him
but
he
went
not
in
costume
but
in
a
frock
coat
to
see
for
himself
how
plots
are
devised
the
thought
of
the
masked
ball
delighted
sasha
for
many
days
but
later
doubts
began
to
assail
him
how
could
he
get
away
from
home
especially
now
after
these
recent
annoyances
it
would
be
a
calamity
if
it
were
found
out
at
the
and
he
would
be
expelled
one
of
the
form
masters
a
young
man
so
liberal
that
he
could
not
call
the
cat
vaska
but
called
it
the
cat
vassily
had
recently
made
a
significant
observation
to
sasha
when
he
gave
out
the
marks
look
here
pilnikov
you
have
to
pay
more
attention
to
your
work
but
i
have
any
twos
said
sasha
indifferently
his
heart
fell
what
would
he
say
next
no
nothing
he
was
silent
and
only
looked
sternly
at
sasha
on
the
day
of
the
masked
ball
sasha
felt
that
he
would
not
have
the
courage
to
go
it
was
terrible
there
was
only
one
thing
the
costume
was
ready
at
the
routilovs
should
it
all
be
for
nothing
and
should
all
the
plans
and
dreams
be
in
vain
and
liudmillotchka
would
cry
no
he
must
go
his
recently
acquired
habit
of
dissembling
aided
sasha
from
betraying
his
agitation
before
kokovkina
luckily
the
old
woman
went
to
bed
early
and
sasha
also
went
to
bed
early
to
keep
away
suspicion
he
put
his
upper
clothes
on
a
chair
near
the
door
and
placed
his
boots
just
outside
the
door
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
now
but
to
go
which
was
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
matter
he
had
only
to
follow
the
same
path
as
when
he
went
to
have
his
costume
fitted
sasha
put
on
a
light
summer
blouse
it
hung
in
the
wardrobe
in
his
room
and
light
house
shoes
and
he
carefully
crept
out
of
the
window
into
the
street
choosing
a
moment
when
there
were
no
footsteps
or
voices
in
hearing
a
small
drizzle
was
falling
it
was
muddy
cold
and
dark
every
moment
sasha
was
afraid
he
would
be
recognised
he
took
off
his
cap
and
shoes
threw
them
back
into
his
room
turned
up
his
trousers
and
ran
jumping
over
the
pavements
slippery
with
rain
it
was
difficult
to
see
a
face
in
the
dark
especially
of
someone
running
and
whoever
met
him
would
think
he
was
an
ordinary
boy
sent
on
an
errand
valeria
and
liudmilla
had
made
for
themselves
unoriginal
but
artistic
costumes
liudmilla
dressed
herself
as
a
gipsy
valeria
as
a
spanish
woman
liudmilla
wore
bright
red
rags
of
silk
and
velvet
while
the
thin
frail
valeria
wore
black
silk
and
lace
and
had
a
black
lace
fan
in
her
hand
darya
did
not
make
herself
a
new
costume
she
kept
last
year
that
of
a
turkish
woman
she
said
it
is
worth
while
making
a
new
one
when
sasha
arrived
all
three
girls
began
to
dress
him
the
wig
worried
sasha
most
of
all
suppose
it
should
come
off
he
kept
repeating
timorously
at
last
they
strengthened
the
wig
with
ribbons
tied
under
the
chin
chapter
xxix
the
masked
ball
took
place
at
the
club
house
in
the
market
square
a
building
of
stone
painted
bright
red
resembling
a
barracks
it
was
arranged
by
the
of
the
local
theatre
the
entrance
which
was
covered
in
by
a
calico
canopy
was
lighted
by
lamps
the
crowd
standing
in
the
street
criticised
the
arrivals
for
the
most
part
unfavourably
the
more
so
since
in
the
streets
the
costumes
were
almost
hidden
under
outside
wraps
the
crowd
judged
chiefly
by
guesswork
the
policemen
zealously
kept
order
in
the
street
while
in
the
hall
itself
the
commissioner
of
police
and
a
were
present
as
guests
every
guest
received
on
entering
two
cards
one
pink
for
the
best
woman
costume
one
green
for
the
man
which
were
to
be
handed
to
the
chosen
persons
some
asked
and
can
we
keep
them
for
ourselves
at
the
beginning
the
attendant
at
the
asked
in
astonishment
why
for
yourselves
but
suppose
we
think
our
own
costumes
the
best
was
the
reply
later
the
attendant
ceased
to
be
astonished
at
these
questions
and
being
a
young
man
with
a
sense
of
humour
said
ironically
help
yourself
keep
both
if
you
like
it
was
dirtyish
in
the
hall
and
from
the
very
beginning
a
number
of
the
crowd
were
tipsy
in
the
close
rooms
with
their
walls
and
ceilings
burned
crooked
lustres
they
seemed
huge
heavy
and
stifling
the
faded
curtains
at
the
doors
looked
such
that
one
hesitated
to
brush
against
them
here
and
there
knots
of
people
gathered
exclamations
and
laughter
were
heard
this
was
caused
by
certain
costumes
which
attracted
general
attention
the
notary
goudayevsky
went
as
an
american
indian
he
had
feathers
in
his
hair
a
mask
with
absurd
green
designs
on
it
a
leather
jacket
a
check
plaid
over
his
shoulder
and
high
leather
boots
with
green
tassels
he
waved
his
arms
jumped
about
and
walked
like
an
athlete
jerking
up
his
naked
knees
exaggeratedly
his
wife
was
dressed
as
an
ear
of
corn
she
had
on
a
costume
of
brightly
coloured
green
and
yellow
patches
ears
of
corn
stuck
out
from
her
on
every
side
they
caught
everyone
she
passed
and
pricked
them
she
was
jostled
and
pinched
as
she
went
along
she
said
angrily
i
scratch
you
everyone
near
laughed
some
one
asked
where
did
she
get
so
many
corn
stalks
she
laid
in
a
store
last
summer
was
the
answer
she
stole
some
every
day
from
the
fields
several
moustacheless
officials
who
were
in
love
with
goudayevskaya
and
who
had
therefore
been
told
by
her
how
she
would
be
dressed
accompanied
her
they
collected
cards
for
her
rudely
and
almost
by
force
they
simply
took
them
away
from
some
who
were
not
very
bold
there
were
other
masked
women
who
were
zealously
collecting
cards
through
their
cavaliers
others
looked
greedily
at
the
cards
which
had
not
yet
been
given
up
and
asked
for
them
these
received
impertinent
answers
one
dejected
woman
dressed
as
night
in
a
blue
costume
with
a
glass
star
and
a
paper
moon
on
her
forehead
said
timidly
to
mourin
do
give
me
your
card
mourin
replied
rudely
what
mean
give
you
my
card
i
do
like
your
mug
night
muttered
something
angrily
and
walked
away
she
only
wanted
two
or
three
cards
to
show
at
home
to
prove
that
she
had
received
some
modest
desires
often
go
unsatisfied
the
schoolmistress
skobotchkina
dressed
herself
as
a
that
is
she
simply
threw
a
bearskin
cross
her
shoulders
and
put
on
a
head
as
a
helmet
over
the
usual
this
was
generally
speaking
shapeless
but
it
suited
her
stout
figure
and
stentorian
voice
the
bear
walked
with
heavy
footsteps
and
bellowed
so
loudly
that
the
lights
in
the
lustres
trembled
many
people
liked
the
bear
and
she
received
quite
a
number
of
tickets
she
was
unable
to
keep
the
cards
herself
and
had
not
found
a
clever
cavalier
like
others
of
the
ladies
more
than
half
of
her
tickets
were
stolen
when
she
was
being
given
vodka
by
some
of
the
small
tradesmen
they
had
a
for
her
sudden
ability
to
display
bearish
manners
people
in
the
crowd
shouted
out
look
how
the
bear
swigs
vodka
skobotchkina
could
not
decide
to
refuse
vodka
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
should
drink
vodka
when
it
was
brought
to
her
a
man
dressed
as
an
ancient
german
was
conspicuous
by
his
stature
and
fine
build
he
pleased
many
because
of
his
robustness
and
because
his
powerful
arms
with
their
muscles
were
visible
women
particularly
walked
after
him
and
all
around
him
rose
a
whisper
of
admiration
and
of
flattery
the
ancient
german
was
recognised
as
the
actor
bengalsky
who
is
a
favourite
in
our
town
that
was
why
he
received
a
large
number
of
tickets
many
people
argued
thus
if
i
ca
get
the
prize
then
at
least
let
an
actor
or
an
actress
get
it
if
any
of
us
get
it
they
will
tire
us
out
with
boasting
grushina
costume
was
also
a
success
a
scandalous
success
the
men
followed
her
in
a
thick
crowd
with
laughter
and
indelicate
observations
the
women
turned
away
in
embarrassment
at
last
the
commissioner
of
police
walked
up
to
grushina
and
said
suavely
madame
i
afraid
you
must
cover
yourself
why
there
nothing
indecent
to
be
seen
about
me
replied
grushina
vigorously
madame
the
ladies
are
offended
said
minchukov
what
do
i
care
for
your
ladies
shouted
grushina
now
madame
insisted
minchukov
you
must
put
at
least
a
handkerchief
on
your
chest
and
back
suppose
my
handkerchief
dirty
said
grushina
with
a
vulgar
laugh
but
minchukov
insisted
as
you
please
madame
but
if
you
do
cover
yourself
a
little
you
have
to
go
grumbling
violently
grushina
went
into
the
and
with
the
help
of
the
attendant
rearranged
the
folds
of
her
dress
across
her
chest
and
back
when
she
returned
to
the
hall
though
she
looked
more
modest
she
just
as
zealously
sought
for
admirers
she
flirted
vulgarly
with
any
man
then
when
people
attention
was
elsewhere
she
went
into
the
to
steal
sweets
soon
she
returned
to
the
hall
and
showing
volodin
a
couple
of
peaches
smiled
impudently
and
said
i
got
them
myself
and
immediately
the
peaches
were
hidden
in
the
folds
of
her
costume
volodin
face
lit
up
with
joy
well
he
said
if
so
i
go
too
soon
grushina
got
tipsy
and
began
to
behave
boisterously
she
shouted
waved
her
arms
and
spat
dianka
getting
very
happy
everyone
said
about
her
such
was
the
masked
ball
to
which
the
foolish
girls
had
enticed
the
schoolboy
the
three
sisters
and
sasha
took
two
cabs
and
arrived
rather
late
on
his
account
their
arrival
in
the
hall
was
noticed
the
geisha
particularly
pleased
many
people
the
rumour
went
round
that
the
geisha
was
kashtanova
the
actress
very
popular
with
the
male
portion
of
local
society
and
that
was
why
sasha
received
a
large
number
of
cards
but
in
fact
kashtanova
was
not
there
for
her
little
boy
had
fallen
dangerously
sasha
intoxicated
by
his
new
situation
coquetted
furiously
the
more
they
stuck
their
cards
into
the
geisha
little
hand
the
more
gaily
and
provokingly
gleamed
the
eyes
of
the
coquettish
geisha
through
the
narrow
slits
of
the
mask
the
geisha
curtsied
lifted
her
small
fingers
laughed
in
an
intimate
tone
waved
her
fan
struck
first
one
man
and
then
another
on
the
shoulder
then
hid
her
face
behind
her
fan
and
frequently
opened
out
her
rose
parasol
however
these
not
actions
attracted
many
who
admired
the
actress
kashtanova
i
will
give
my
card
to
the
most
beautiful
of
ladies
said
tishkov
and
handed
his
card
to
the
geisha
with
a
gallant
bow
he
had
taken
a
good
deal
to
drink
and
his
face
was
flushed
his
motionlessly
smiling
face
and
awkward
figure
made
him
look
like
a
doll
and
he
kept
continually
rhyming
valeria
looked
on
at
sasha
success
and
felt
envious
and
annoyed
she
now
wanted
to
be
recognised
and
to
have
her
costume
and
slender
graceful
figure
please
the
crowd
and
be
awarded
the
prize
and
now
she
sadly
thought
that
this
was
not
possible
as
all
the
three
sisters
had
agreed
to
get
cards
only
for
the
geisha
and
even
to
give
their
own
to
her
they
were
dancing
in
the
hall
volodin
got
tipsy
very
soon
and
began
to
dance
the
squat
dance
the
police
stopped
him
he
said
cheerfully
and
obediently
well
if
i
must
then
i
must
but
two
other
men
who
had
followed
his
example
and
were
dancing
the
squat
dance
refused
to
obey
the
order
what
right
have
you
to
stop
us
have
we
paid
our
they
exclaimed
and
were
escorted
out
volodin
went
with
them
to
the
door
cutting
capers
smiling
and
dancing
the
routilov
girls
made
haste
to
find
peredonov
to
make
a
fool
of
him
he
sat
alone
at
the
window
and
looked
at
the
crowd
with
wandering
eyes
all
people
and
objects
seemed
to
him
senseless
inharmonious
and
equally
hostile
liudmilla
in
her
gipsy
dress
went
up
to
him
and
said
in
a
guttural
voice
shall
i
tell
your
fortune
pretty
gentleman
go
to
the
devil
shouted
peredonov
the
gipsy
sudden
appearance
frightened
him
give
me
your
hand
dear
gentleman
pretty
gentleman
i
can
see
from
your
face
that
you
be
rich
you
be
an
important
official
liudmilla
importuned
him
and
took
his
hand
well
see
that
you
give
me
a
good
fortune
growled
peredonov
my
sweet
gentleman
began
the
gipsy
you
have
many
enemies
inform
against
you
you
will
weep
you
will
die
under
a
fence
carrion
shouted
peredonov
and
snatched
his
hand
away
liudmilla
quickly
disappeared
in
the
crowd
then
valeria
took
her
place
she
sat
down
beside
peredonov
and
whispered
to
him
very
tenderly
i
am
a
lovely
spanish
maid
and
i
love
such
men
as
you
but
that
your
wife
a
wretched
jade
handsome
gentleman
is
true
it
a
lie
you
fool
growled
peredonov
valeria
went
on
hotter
than
day
sweeter
than
night
is
my
keen
seville
kiss
spit
in
her
dull
eyes
my
light
and
see
that
you
do
miss
varvara
is
your
wife
you
are
handsome
ardalyon
she
a
plague
upon
your
life
you
as
wise
as
solomon
that
true
enough
said
peredonov
but
how
can
i
spit
in
her
eyes
she
complain
to
the
princess
and
i
sha
get
the
place
and
why
do
you
want
the
place
you
good
enough
without
the
place
said
valeria
yes
but
how
can
i
live
if
i
do
get
it
said
peredonov
dejectedly
darya
stuck
into
volodin
hand
a
letter
with
a
red
seal
on
it
volodin
unsealed
the
letter
bleating
happily
read
it
and
lapsed
into
thought
he
looked
proud
and
a
little
flurried
it
was
written
briefly
and
clearly
come
my
darling
and
meet
me
night
at
eleven
at
the
soldiers
baths
your
unknown
j
volodin
believed
in
the
letter
but
the
question
was
was
it
worth
going
and
who
was
this
j
was
it
some
sort
of
jenny
or
was
it
the
surname
which
began
with
j
volodin
showed
the
letter
to
routilov
go
of
course
go
routilov
urged
him
and
see
what
happens
perhaps
it
some
rich
catch
who
fallen
in
love
with
you
and
the
parents
are
against
it
so
she
taken
this
way
of
speaking
to
you
but
volodin
thought
and
thought
and
decided
that
it
was
not
worth
while
going
he
said
with
an
important
air
they
always
running
after
me
but
i
do
want
girls
so
loose
that
they
run
away
from
home
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
get
a
beating
for
the
soldiers
baths
were
situated
in
a
lonely
place
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
when
the
dense
noisy
uproariously
gay
crowd
was
pushing
its
way
into
every
part
of
the
club
house
from
the
door
of
the
dancing
hall
came
a
noise
laughter
and
exclamations
of
approval
everyone
crowded
in
that
direction
it
was
announced
from
one
to
another
that
a
fearfully
original
mask
had
come
in
a
thin
tall
man
in
a
greasy
patched
with
a
besom
under
his
arm
with
a
hat
in
his
hand
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
he
had
a
cardboard
mask
on
a
stupid
face
with
a
small
narrow
beard
and
side
whiskers
and
on
his
head
was
a
cap
with
a
round
official
badge
he
kept
repeating
in
an
astonished
voice
they
told
me
there
was
a
masquerade
here
but
no
one
seems
to
be
bathing
and
he
languidly
swung
a
pail
the
crowd
followed
him
exclaiming
and
genuinely
admiring
his
original
idea
he
get
the
prize
said
volodin
enviously
like
many
others
he
envied
unthinkingly
he
himself
wore
no
costume
so
why
should
he
be
envious
machigin
was
enthusiastic
over
this
costume
the
badge
especially
aroused
his
delight
he
laughed
uproariously
clapped
his
hands
and
observed
to
acquaintances
and
to
strangers
a
fine
criticism
these
officials
always
make
a
great
deal
of
themselves
they
wear
badges
and
uniforms
well
here
a
fine
criticism
for
them
very
clever
indeed
when
it
got
hot
the
official
in
the
began
to
fan
himself
with
the
besom
exclaiming
well
here
a
bath
for
you
those
near
laughed
gleefully
there
was
a
shower
of
cards
into
the
pail
peredonov
looked
at
the
besom
wavering
above
the
crowd
he
thought
it
was
the
nedotikomka
she
gone
green
the
beast
he
thought
in
horror
masquerade
this
word
is
used
in
russia
to
mean
either
a
ball
or
a
bath
owing
to
the
fact
that
clothes
are
taken
off
on
both
occasions
referring
to
the
fact
that
a
besom
is
used
in
russian
and
turkish
baths
chapter
xxx
at
last
the
counting
of
the
cards
began
the
stewards
of
the
club
composed
the
committee
a
tensely
expectant
crowd
gathered
at
the
door
of
the
judges
room
for
a
short
time
in
the
everything
became
quiet
and
dull
the
music
ceased
the
company
grew
silent
peredonov
felt
sad
but
soon
an
impatient
hum
of
conversation
began
in
the
crowd
someone
said
in
an
assured
tone
that
both
prizes
would
go
to
actors
you
see
someone
irritated
hissing
voice
could
be
heard
saying
the
crowd
was
restless
those
who
had
received
only
a
few
cards
were
vexed
at
this
those
who
had
a
larger
number
of
cards
were
disturbed
by
the
expectation
of
a
possible
injustice
suddenly
a
bell
tingled
lightly
and
nervously
the
judges
came
out
they
were
veriga
avinovitsky
kirillov
and
other
stewards
of
the
club
the
crowd
excitement
passed
through
the
hall
suddenly
everyone
was
silent
avinovitsky
shouted
in
a
stentorian
voice
which
was
heard
through
the
whole
hall
the
album

the
best

been
awarded
according
to
the
majority
of

in
the
costume
of
an
ancient
german
avinovitsky
lifted
the
album
on
high
and
looked
savagely
at
the
crowding
guests
the
huge
german
began
to
make
his
way
through
the
crowd
the
others
looked
hostilely
at
him
and
obstructed
his
passage
do
jostle
please
shouted
in
a
tearful
voice
the
dejected
woman
in
the
blue
costume
with
the
glass
star
and
the
paper
moon
night
he
got
the
prize
and
he
thinks
the
women
must
fall
at
his
feet
shouted
a
viciously
angry
voice
you
wo
let
me
pass
yourself
said
the
german
with
suppressed
annoyance
at
last
he
managed
somehow
to
get
to
the
judges
and
veriga
presented
him
with
the
album
the
band
played
a
flourish
but
the
sound
of
the
music
was
lost
in
the
disorderly
noise
people
shouted
abusive
exclamations
they
surrounded
the
german
jostled
him
and
shouted
take
off
your
mask
the
german
said
nothing
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
get
through
the
crowd
but
he
obviously
hesitated
to
use
his
full
strength
goudayevsky
caught
hold
of
the
album
and
at
the
same
time
someone
quickly
tore
the
mask
from
the
german
face
the
crowd
cried
out
it
is
an
actor
their
suppositions
were
justified
it
was
the
actor
bengalsky
he
shouted
angrily
yes
it
is
an
actor
and
what
of
it
you
gave
me
the
cards
yourselves
in
answer
came
the
virulent
exclamation
it
easy
to
slip
in
a
few
extra
you
printed
the
cards
there
have
been
more
cards
given
in
than
there
are
people
here
he
brought
fifty
cards
in
his
pocket
bengalsky
flushed
and
shouted
it
disgusting
to
talk
like
that
you
can
prove
it
if
you
like
you
can
count
the
cards
and
the
number
of
people
veriga
interposed
saying
to
those
near
him
gentlemen
calm
yourselves
there
been
no
cheating
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
the
number
of
tickets
has
been
carefully
checked
with
the
number
of
entries
the
stewards
with
the
help
of
a
few
of
the
more
sensible
guests
somehow
pacified
the
crowd
besides
everyone
was
anxious
to
know
who
would
get
the
fan
veriga
announced
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
largest
number
of
cards
for
the
best
costume
has
been
received
by
the
lady
in
the
geisha
costume
who
has
therefore
been
awarded
the
prize
a
fan
geisha
please
come
this
way
the
fan
is
yours
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
humbly
request
you
to
make
way
for
the
geisha
the
band
again
gave
a
flourish
the
frightened
geisha
longed
to
run
away
but
she
was
jostled
along
and
led
forward
veriga
with
an
amiable
smile
handed
her
the
fan
the
colours
of
the
variegated
costumes
glimmered
before
sasha
eyes
which
were
half
dimmed
by
fear
and
confusion
he
would
have
to
return
thanks
he
thought
the
habitual
politeness
of
a
boy
showed
itself
the
geisha
made
a
curtsy
said
something
indistinctly
laughed
slightly
and
lifted
her
fingers
and
again
in
the
room
rose
a
furious
uproar
of
whistling
and
abuse
everyone
made
a
rush
for
the
geisha
the
savage
and
dishevelled
ear
of
corn
cried
make
a
curtsy
you
little
beast
the
geisha
threw
herself
towards
the
door
but
her
way
was
barred
from
the
crowd
which
seethed
around
the
geisha
came
malignant
outcries
make
her
unmask
mask
off
catch
her
hold
her
tear
it
off
take
her
fan
away
the
ear
of
corn
shouted
do
you
know
who
got
the
prize
kashtanova
the
actress
she
stole
someone
else
husband
and
yet
she
gets
the
prize
they
do
give
it
to
honest
women
they
give
it
to
that
creature
and
she
threw
herself
towards
the
geisha
with
piercing
screams
clenching
her
bony
fists
others
came
after
her
mostly
her
cavaliers
the
geisha
fought
them
off
desperately
a
wild
tussle
began
the
fan
was
broken
torn
out
of
her
hands
thrown
on
the
floor
and
trodden
upon
the
crowd
with
the
geisha
in
the
middle
swayed
furiously
across
the
room
sweeping
onlookers
from
their
feet
neither
the
routilovs
nor
the
club
stewards
could
reach
the
geisha
the
geisha
strong
and
alert
screamed
piercingly
scratched
and
bit
her
assailants
she
held
her
mask
on
tightly
now
with
one
hand
now
with
the
other
they
ought
all
to
be
beaten
screeched
some
spiteful
little
woman
the
tipsy
grushina
hiding
behind
the
others
urged
on
volodin
and
other
acquaintances
pinch
her
pinch
the
creature
she
shouted
machigin
holding
his
bleeding
nose
jumped
out
from
the
crowd
and
complained
she
hit
me
straight
in
the
nose
with
her
fist
a
vicious
young
man
caught
the
geisha
sleeve
in
his
teeth
and
tore
it
in
half
the
geisha
cried
out
help
save
me
and
others
began
to
tear
her
costume
here
and
there
her
body
showed
slightly
darya
and
liudmilla
struggled
desperately
trying
to
squeeze
through
to
the
geisha
but
in
vain
volodin
plucked
at
the
geisha
so
zealously
screamed
and
cut
such
capers
that
he
hindered
other
people
less
drunk
than
himself
and
more
spiteful
he
did
not
attack
her
from
spite
but
from
drunken
joy
imagining
that
some
very
amusing
farce
was
going
on
he
tore
one
sleeve
clean
off
the
geisha
dress
and
he
tied
it
round
his
head
it
come
in
useful
he
shouted
laughing
and
grimacing
getting
out
of
the
thick
of
the
crowd
he
went
on
making
a
fool
of
himself
in
the
open
space
and
danced
over
the
pieces
of
the
fan
with
wild
squeals
there
was
no
one
to
restrain
him
peredonov
looked
at
him
in
dread
and
thought
he
dancing
he
glad
for
something
that
how
he
dance
on
my
grave
at
last
the
geisha
tore
herself
away
the
crowd
about
her
could
not
withstand
her
quick
fists
and
sharp
teeth
the
geisha
dashed
from
the
room
in
the
corridor
the
ear
of
corn
rushed
at
the
geisha
again
and
caught
hold
of
her
dress
the
geisha
almost
succeeded
in
tearing
herself
away
but
she
was
again
surrounded
the
scuffle
was
renewed
they
pulling
her
by
the
ears
someone
exclaimed
a
little
woman
caught
the
geisha
ear
and
pulled
it
with
loud
triumphant
cries
the
geisha
screamed
and
somehow
tore
herself
away
after
having
hit
the
malicious
little
woman
with
her
fist
at
last
bengalsky
who
had
managed
in
the
meantime
to
put
on
his
ordinary
dress
fought
his
way
towards
the
geisha
he
took
the
trembling
geisha
in
his
arms
covered
her
with
his
huge
body
and
arms
as
far
as
he
could
and
quickly
carried
her
away
thrusting
the
crowd
aside
with
his
elbows
and
feet
the
crowd
shouted
rotter
scoundrel
they
tugged
at
bengalsky
and
punched
him
in
the
back
he
exclaimed
i
wo
allow
the
mask
to
be
torn
from
a
woman
do
what
you
like
i
wo
allow
it
in
this
way
he
carried
the
geisha
the
entire
length
of
the
corridor
which
culminated
in
a
narrow
door
opening
into
the
club
here
veriga
managed
to
hold
back
the
crowd
for
a
short
time
with
the
resolution
of
a
soldier
he
stood
there
and
refused
to
allow
anyone
to
pass
he
said
gentlemen
you
ca
go
any
farther
goudayevskaya
rustling
with
the
remaining
ears
of
corn
of
her
costume
dashed
at
veriga
clenching
her
fists
and
screamed
piercingly
go
away
let
us
pass
but
the
general
imposingly
cold
face
and
his
determined
grey
eyes
kept
her
from
doing
anything
more
she
cried
in
helpless
rage
to
her
husband
you
might
have
boxed
her
ears
you
gaping
it
was
hard
to
get
at
her
the
indian
justified
himself
gesticulating
wildly
pavloushka
was
in
the
way
you
ought
to
have
hit
pavloushka
in
the
teeth
and
her
in
the
ear
why
did
you
stand
on
ceremony
screamed
goudayevskaya
the
crowd
pressed
against
yeriga
they
abused
him
fully
veriga
stood
calmly
before
the
door
and
tried
to
persuade
those
nearest
him
to
preserve
order
the
opened
the
door
behind
veriga
and
whispered
they
gone
your
excellency
veriga
walked
away
the
crowd
broke
into
the
then
into
the
kitchen
they
looked
for
the
geisha
but
did
not
find
her
bengalsky
carrying
the
geisha
ran
through
the
into
the
kitchen
she
lay
tranquilly
in
his
arms
and
said
nothing
bengalsky
thought
he
could
hear
the
strong
beating
of
the
geisha
heart
on
her
bare
arms
he
noticed
several
scratches
and
near
the
elbow
the
stain
of
a
bruise
in
a
hurried
voice
bengalsky
said
to
the
crowding
servants
in
the
kitchen
quick
an
overcoat
a
a
sheet
anything
i
must
save
this
lady
an
overcoat
was
thrown
on
sasha
shoulders
bengalsky
somehow
wrapped
it
round
the
geisha
and
traversing
the
dark
stairs
lighted
by
dim
smoky
paraffin
lamps
carried
her
into
the
yard
and
through
a
gate
into
the
street
take
off
the
mask
you
be
more
likely
to
be
recognised
with
it
on
and
anyway
it
quite
dark
here
i
tell
no
one
said
he
rather
inconsistently
he
was
curious
he
knew
for
certain
that
it
was
not
kashtanova
but
who
was
it
then
the
geisha
obeyed
bengalsky
saw
an
unfamiliar
smooth
face
on
which
fright
was
giving
place
to
an
expression
of
joy
at
an
escaped
danger
a
pair
of
cheerful
eyes
gazed
at
the
actor
face
how
can
i
thank
you
said
the
geisha
in
a
clear
voice
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
you
had
saved
me
she
no
coward
an
interesting
little
woman
thought
the
actor
but
who
is
she
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
a
new
arrival
bengalsky
knew
the
women
of
the
district
he
said
quietly
to
sasha
i
must
take
you
home
at
once
give
me
your
address
and
i
call
a
cabby
the
geisha
face
again
became
dark
with
fear
you
must
you
simply
must
she
whispered
i
will
go
home
alone
let
me
down
here
but
how
can
you
go
home
in
such
mud
and
with
those
wooden
shoes
better
let
me
call
a
cab
said
the
actor
persuasively
no
i
go
by
myself
for
god
sake
let
me
down
entreated
the
geisha
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
i
wo
tell
anyone
said
bengalsky
reassuringly
i
must
let
you
go
you
catch
cold
i
responsible
for
you
now
and
i
ca
let
you
go
but
tell
me
quickly
they
might
get
after
you
even
here
you
saw
what
savages
they
are
they
capable
of
anything
the
geisha
trembled
quick
tears
suddenly
trickled
from
her
eyes
she
said
sobbing
terribly
cruel
people
take
me
to
the
routilovs
for
the
present
and
i
spend
the
night
there
bengalsky
called
a
cab
they
got
in
and
drove
off
the
actor
looked
intently
at
the
geisha
face
there
seemed
to
him
to
be
something
strange
about
it
the
geisha
turned
her
face
away
the
about
liudmilla
and
a
schoolboy
suddenly
occurred
to
bengalsky
mind
you
a
boy
he
said
in
a
whisper
so
that
the
cabby
should
not
hear
for
god
sake
said
sasha
growing
pale
with
fear
and
his
smooth
hands
under
the
overcoat
stretched
themselves
towards
bengalsky
with
a
movement
of
entreaty
bengalsky
laughed
quietly
and
whispered
i
wo
tell
anyone
do
be
afraid
my
business
is
to
get
you
home
safe
and
beyond
that
i
know
nothing
but
you
a
daring
kid
they
find
out
at
home
if
you
do
say
anything
no
one
will
know
said
sasha
in
a
voice
of
gentle
entreaty
you
can
depend
on
me
i
shall
be
silent
as
the
grave
replied
the
actor
i
was
a
boy
myself
once
i
was
up
to
all
sorts
of
pranks
the
clamour
in
the
club
had
already
begun
to
calm
down
but
the
evening
terminated
in
a
new
calamity
while
they
were
tussling
with
the
geisha
in
the
corridor
the
flaming
nedotikomka
jumping
on
the
lustres
laughed
and
insistently
whispered
to
peredonov
that
he
should
strike
a
match
and
let
loose
her
the
flaming
but
confined
nedotikomka
on
these
dingy
dirty
walls
and
when
she
had
gorged
herself
with
the
destruction
of
this
building
where
such
terrible
and
incomprehensible
deeds
were
happening
then
she
would
leave
peredonov
unmolested
and
peredonov
could
not
resist
her
importunate
whisper
he
entered
the
little
which
was
next
to
the
it
was
empty
peredonov
looked
around
struck
a
match
put
it
to
the
window
curtain
at
the
floor
and
waited
till
the
hangings
caught
fire
the
flaming
nedotikomka
like
an
active
little
snake
crept
up
the
curtain
squealing
softly
and
happily
peredonov
walked
out
of
the
closing
the
door
behind
him
no
one
noticed
the
incendiary
the
fire
was
only
seen
from
the
street
when
the
whole
room
was
in
flames
the
fire
spread
quickly
the
people
escaped
but
the
club
house
was
burnt
down
on
the
next
day
the
town
talked
of
nothing
but
the
geisha
affair
and
the
fire
bengalsky
kept
his
word
and
told
no
one
that
the
geisha
was
a
disguised
boy
as
for
sasha
he
had
redressed
himself
that
night
at
routilovs
and
turning
once
more
into
a
simple
barefoot
boy
ran
home
crept
through
the
window
and
went
quietly
to
sleep
in
the
town
seething
with
slanders
in
the
town
where
everyone
knew
everything
about
everyone
sasha
nocturnal
adventure
remained
a
secret
for
long
but
of
course
not
for
always
chapter
xxxi
ekaterina
ivanovna
pilnikova
sasha
aunt
and
guardian
received
simultaneously
two
letters
about
sasha
one
from
the
and
the
other
from
kokovkina
these
letters
greatly
alarmed
her
she
put
all
her
affairs
aside
and
drove
at
once
from
her
village
through
the
muddy
autumn
roads
to
our
town
sasha
who
loved
his
aunt
met
her
with
great
joy
his
aunt
came
with
the
intention
of
rating
him
soundly
but
he
threw
himself
on
her
neck
with
such
gladness
and
kissed
her
hands
so
affectionately
that
she
could
not
at
first
speak
severely
to
him
dear
auntie
how
good
of
you
to
come
said
sasha
and
looked
happily
at
her
full
rosy
face
with
its
kind
dimples
on
the
cheeks
and
its
grave
hazel
eyes
you
better
postpone
your
pleasure
i
must
scold
you
first
said
his
aunt
in
an
irresolute
voice
i
do
mind
that
said
sasha
indifferently
scold
me
if
you
have
anything
to
scold
me
for
but
still
i
terribly
glad
to
see
you
terribly
she
repeated
in
a
displeased
voice
i
been
hearing
terrible
things
about
you
sasha
lifted
his
eyebrows
and
looked
at
his
aunt
with
innocent
uncomprehending
eyes
there
one
master
peredonov
here
he
complained
who
has
invented
the
tale
that
i
a
girl
he
been
annoying
me
and
then
the
scolded
me
because
i
had
got
to
know
the
routilov
girls
as
if
i
went
there
to
steal
things
and
what
business
is
it
of
theirs
he
quite
the
same
child
that
he
was
before
thought
his
aunt
in
perplexity
or
has
he
become
spoilt
and
corrupted
so
that
he
can
deceive
one
even
with
his
face
she
shut
herself
in
with
kokovkina
and
talked
to
her
for
a
long
time
she
came
out
looking
quite
grave
then
she
went
to
the
she
returned
quite
upset
she
showered
reproaches
on
sasha
sasha
cried
but
firmly
assured
her
that
it
was
all
an
invention
that
he
did
not
permit
himself
any
liberties
with
the
routilov
girls
his
aunt
did
not
believe
him
she
scolded
him
wept
and
threatened
to
give
him
a
good
whipping
at
once
that
is
as
soon
as
she
had
seen
these
girls
sasha
kept
crying
and
assuring
her
that
nothing
wrong
had
happened
and
that
it
was
all
very
exaggerated
his
aunt
angry
and
bloated
with
tears
went
to
the
routilovs
as
she
waited
in
the
routilovs
ekaterina
ivanovna
felt
very
agitated
she
wanted
to
throw
herself
on
the
sisters
at
once
with
the
severest
reproaches
which
she
had
prepared
beforehand
but
their
peaceful
pretty
aroused
peaceful
thoughts
in
her
against
her
will
and
softened
her
vexation
the
unfinished
embroidery
left
lying
about
the
keepsakes
the
engravings
on
the
walls
the
carefully
trained
plants
at
the
windows
the
absence
of
dust
and
the
appearance
of
the
room
were
not
at
all
what
one
would
expect
in
an
unrespectable
house
there
was
everything
that
is
valued
by
housewives
the
world
over
surely
with
such
surroundings
the
young
owners
of
such
a
could
not
have
corrupted
her
innocent
young
sasha
all
the
conjectures
she
had
made
about
sasha
seemed
to
her
ridiculously
absurd
on
the
other
hand
sasha
explanations
about
his
doings
at
the
routilovs
seemed
reasonable
they
read
chatted
joked
laughed
and
played
they
wanted
to
get
up
an
amateur
play
but
olga
vassilyevna
would
not
allow
him
to
take
part
the
three
sisters
felt
apprehensive
they
did
not
yet
know
whether
sasha
masquerading
had
remained
a
secret
but
there
were
three
of
them
and
they
all
felt
solicitous
for
one
another
this
gave
them
courage
all
three
of
them
gathered
in
liudmilla
room
and
deliberated
in
whispers
we
must
go
down
to
her
said
valeria
it
rude
to
keep
her
waiting
let
her
cool
off
a
little
replied
darya
indifferently
or
she
go
for
us
the
sisters
scented
themselves
with
clematis
they
came
in
tranquil
cheerful
attractive
pretty
as
always
they
filled
the
with
their
charming
chatter
and
gaiety
ekaterina
ivanovna
was
immediately
fascinated
by
them
so
these
are
the
corrupters
she
thought
with
vexation
at
the
school
pedagogues
but
then
she
thought
that
perhaps
they
were
assuming
this
modesty
she
decided
not
to
yield
to
their
fascination
you
must
forgive
me
young
ladies
but
i
have
something
serious
to
discuss
with
you
she
said
trying
to
make
her
voice
dry
and
the
sisters
made
her
sit
down
and
kept
up
a
gay
chatter
which
of
you
ekaterina
ivanovna
began
irresolutely
liudmilla
as
if
she
were
a
graceful
hostess
trying
to
get
a
visitor
out
of
a
difficulty
said
cheerfully
it
was
i
who
spent
most
of
the
time
with
your
nephew
we
have
similar
views
and
tastes
in
many
things
your
nephew
is
a
very
charming
boy
said
darya
as
if
she
were
confident
that
her
praise
would
please
the
visitor
really
most
charming
and
so
entertaining
said
liudmilla
ekaterina
ivanovna
felt
more
and
more
awkward
she
suddenly
realised
that
she
had
no
reasonable
cause
for
complaint
and
this
made
her
angry
liudmilla
last
words
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
express
her
vexation
she
said
angrily
he
may
be
an
entertainment
to
you
but
to
him
but
darya
interrupted
her
and
said
in
a
sympathetic
voice
oh
i
can
see
that
those
silly
peredonovian
tales
have
reached
you
of
course
you
know
that
he
quite
mad
the
does
not
even
allow
him
to
go
to
the
now
they
only
waiting
for
an
alienist
to
examine
him
and
then
he
will
be
dismissed
from
the
school
but
allow
me
ekaterina
ivanovna
interrupted
her
with
increasing
irritation
i
am
not
interested
in
this
schoolmaster
but
in
my
nephew
i
have
heard
that
you
pardon
me
are
corrupting
him
and
having
thrown
out
this
decisive
word
in
her
anger
with
the
sisters
ekaterina
ivanovna
at
once
saw
that
she
had
gone
too
far
the
sisters
exchanged
glances
of
such
perplexity
and
indignation
that
cleverer
people
than
ekaterina
ivanovna
would
have
been
taken
in
they
flushed
and
exclaimed
altogether
that
pleasant
how
terrible
that
something
new
madam
said
darya
coldly
you
are
not
over
choice
in
your
expressions
before
you
make
use
of
such
words
you
should
find
out
whether
they
are
fitting
of
course
one
can
understand
that
said
liudmilla
with
the
look
of
a
charming
girl
forgiving
an
injury
he
not
a
stranger
to
you
naturally
you
ca
help
being
disturbed
by
this
stupid
gossip
even
strangers
like
ourselves
were
sorry
for
him
and
had
to
be
kind
to
him
but
everything
in
our
town
is
made
a
crime
at
once
you
have
no
idea
what
terrible
terrible
people
live
here
terrible
people
repeated
valeria
quietly
in
a
clear
fragile
voice
and
shivered
from
head
to
foot
as
if
she
had
come
in
contact
with
something
unclean
you
ask
him
yourself
said
darya
just
look
at
him
he
still
a
mere
child
perhaps
you
have
got
used
to
his
naïveté
but
one
can
see
better
from
the
outside
that
he
quite
an
unspoiled
boy
the
sisters
lied
with
such
assurance
and
tranquillity
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
believe
them
why
not
lies
have
often
more
verisimilitude
than
the
truth
nearly
always
as
for
truth
of
course
it
has
no
verisimilitude
of
course
it
is
true
that
he
was
often
here
said
darya
but
we
sha
let
him
cross
our
threshold
again
if
you
object
and
i
shall
go
and
see
khripatch
said
liudmilla
how
did
he
get
hold
of
that
notion
surely
he
does
believe
such
a
stupid
tale
no
i
do
think
he
believes
it
himself
admitted
ekaterina
ivanovna
but
he
says
that
various
unpleasant
rumours
are
going
about
there
you
see
exclaimed
liudmilla
happily
of
course
he
believe
it
himself
what
the
reason
of
all
this
fuss
then
liudmilla
cheerful
voice
deceived
ekaterina
ivanovna
she
thought
i
wonder
what
exactly
has
happened
the
does
say
that
he
does
believe
it
the
sisters
for
a
long
time
supported
each
other
in
persuading
ekaterina
ivanovna
of
the
complete
innocence
of
their
relations
with
sasha
to
set
her
mind
more
completely
at
rest
they
were
on
the
point
of
telling
her
in
detail
precisely
what
they
did
with
sasha
but
they
stopped
short
because
they
were
all
such
innocent
simple
things
that
it
was
difficult
to
remember
them
and
ekaterina
ivanovna
at
last
came
to
believe
that
her
sasha
and
the
charming
routilovs
were
the
innocent
victims
of
stupid
slander
as
she
bade
them
she
kissed
them
kindly
and
said
you
charming
simple
girls
i
thought
at
first
that
you
were
forgive
the
rude
word
wantons
the
sisters
laughed
gaily
liudmilla
said
no
we
just
happy
girls
with
sharp
little
tongues
and
that
why
we
not
liked
by
some
of
the
local
geese
when
she
returned
from
the
routilovs
sasha
aunt
said
nothing
to
him
he
met
her
feeling
rather
frightened
and
embarrassed
and
he
looked
at
her
cautiously
and
attentively
after
a
long
deliberation
with
kokovkina
the
aunt
decided
i
must
see
the
again
that
same
day
liudmilla
went
to
see
khripatch
she
sat
for
some
time
in
the
with
the
wife
and
then
announced
that
she
had
come
to
see
nikolai
vassilyevitch
on
business
an
animated
conversation
took
place
in
khripatch
study
not
because
they
had
much
to
say
to
one
another
but
because
they
liked
to
chatter
and
they
talked
rapidly
to
each
other
khripatch
with
his
dry
crackling
volubility
liudmilla
with
her
gentle
resonant
prattle
with
the
irresistible
persuasiveness
of
falsehood
she
poured
out
to
khripatch
her
story
of
her
relations
with
sasha
pilnikov
her
chief
motives
were
of
course
her
sympathy
with
the
boy
who
was
suffering
from
this
coarse
suspicion
her
desire
to
take
the
place
of
sasha
absent
family
and
finally
he
was
such
a
charming
unspoiled
boy
liudmilla
even
cried
a
little
and
her
swift
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
to
her
lips
giving
her
an
extraordinary
attractiveness
i
have
grown
to
love
him
like
a
brother
she
said
he
is
a
fine
lovable
boy
he
appreciated
affection
and
he
kissed
my
hands
that
was
very
good
of
you
said
khripatch
somewhat
flustered
and
does
honour
to
your
kind
feelings
but
you
have
needlessly
taken
to
heart
the
simple
fact
that
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
inform
the
relatives
of
the
rumours
that
reached
me
liudmilla
prattled
on
without
listening
to
him
and
her
voice
passed
into
a
tone
of
gentle
rebuke
tell
me
what
was
wrong
in
our
taking
an
interest
in
the
boy
why
should
he
suffer
from
that
coarse
mad
peredonov
when
shall
we
be
rid
of
him
ca
you
see
yourself
that
pilnikov
is
quite
a
child
really
a
mere
child
she
clasped
her
small
pretty
hands
together
rattled
her
gold
bracelets
laughed
softly
took
her
handkerchief
out
to
dry
her
tears
and
wafted
a
delicate
perfume
towards
khripatch
and
khripatch
suddenly
wanted
to
tell
her
that
she
was
lovely
as
a
heavenly
angel
and
that
this
unfortunate
episode
was
not
worth
a
single
instant
of
her
dear
sorrow
but
he
refrained
and
liudmilla
chattered
on
and
on
and
dissolved
into
smoke
the
chimerical
structure
of
the
peredonovian
lie
think
of
comparing
the
charming
liudmillotchka
with
the
crude
dirty
insane
peredonov
whether
liudmilla
was
telling
the
whole
truth
or
romancing
was
all
the
same
to
khripatch
but
he
felt
that
if
he
did
not
believe
liudmilla
and
should
argue
with
her
and
take
steps
to
punish
pilnikov
it
might
lead
to
an
inquiry
and
disgrace
the
whole
school
district
all
the
more
since
this
business
was
bound
up
with
peredonov
who
would
be
found
to
be
insane
and
khripatch
smiled
saying
to
liudmilla
i
very
sorry
that
this
should
upset
you
so
much
i
did
for
a
moment
permit
myself
any
disagreeable
suspicions
of
your
acquaintance
with
pilnikov
i
esteem
most
highly
those
good
and
kindly
motives
which
have
inspired
your
actions
and
not
for
a
single
instant
have
i
considered
the
rumours
that
passed
in
the
town
and
those
that
reached
me
as
anything
but
unreasonable
slanders
which
gave
me
deep
concern
i
was
obliged
to
inform
madame
pilnikov
especially
since
even
more
distorted
rumours
might
have
reached
her
but
i
had
no
intention
of
distressing
you
and
had
no
idea
that
madame
pilnikov
would
come
and
complain
to
you
we
had
a
satisfactory
explanation
with
madame
pilnikov
said
liudmilla
but
do
punish
sasha
on
our
account
if
our
house
is
so
dangerous
for
schoolboys
we
wo
let
him
come
again
you
very
good
to
him
said
khripatch
irresolutely
we
can
have
nothing
against
his
visiting
his
acquaintances
in
his
leisure
hours
if
his
aunt
permits
it
we
are
very
far
from
wishing
to
turn
lodgings
into
places
of
confinement
in
any
case
until
the
peredonov
affair
is
decided
it
would
be
better
for
pilnikov
to
remain
at
home
the
accepted
explanation
given
by
the
routilov
girls
and
by
sasha
received
confirmation
from
a
terrible
event
which
happened
in
the
peredonovs
house
this
finally
convinced
the
townspeople
that
all
the
rumours
about
sasha
and
the
routilov
girls
were
the
ravings
of
a
madman
chapter
xxxii
it
was
a
cold
bleak
day
peredonov
had
just
left
volodin
he
felt
depressed
vershina
lured
him
into
the
garden
he
yielded
again
to
her
witching
call
the
two
of
them
walked
towards
the
over
the
moist
footpaths
which
were
covered
by
the
dark
rotting
fallen
leaves
the
felt
unpleasantly
damp
the
house
with
its
windows
closed
was
visible
through
the
bare
trees
i
want
you
to
know
the
truth
mumbled
vershina
as
she
looked
quickly
at
peredonov
and
then
turned
away
her
black
eyes
she
was
wrapped
in
a
black
jacket
her
head
was
tied
round
with
a
black
kerchief
and
her
lips
grown
blue
with
the
cold
were
clenched
on
a
black
cigarette
holder
and
sent
out
thick
clouds
of
black
smoke
i
want
to
spit
on
your
truth
replied
peredonov
nothing
would
please
me
better
vershina
smiled
wryly
and
said
do
say
that
i
am
terribly
sorry
for
you
you
have
been
fooled
there
was
a
malicious
joy
in
her
voice
malevolent
words
flowed
from
her
tongue
she
said
you
were
hoping
to
get
patronage
but
you
were
too
trustful
you
have
been
fooled
and
you
believed
so
easily
anyone
can
write
a
letter
you
should
have
known
with
whom
you
were
dealing
your
wife
is
not
a
very
particular
person
peredonov
understood
vershina
mumbling
speech
with
some
difficulty
her
meaning
peered
out
through
all
her
circumlocutions
vershina
was
afraid
to
speak
loudly
and
clearly
someone
might
hear
if
she
spoke
loudly
and
tell
varvara
who
would
not
hesitate
to
make
a
scene
and
peredonov
himself
might
get
into
a
rage
if
she
spoke
clearly
and
even
beat
her
it
was
better
to
hint
so
that
he
might
guess
the
truth
but
peredonov
did
not
rise
to
the
occasion
it
had
happened
before
that
he
had
been
told
to
his
face
of
the
deception
practised
on
him
yet
he
never
grasped
the
fact
that
the
letters
had
been
forged
and
kept
on
thinking
that
it
was
the
princess
who
was
fooling
him
leading
him
by
the
nose
at
last
vershina
said
bluntly
you
think
the
princess
wrote
those
letters
why
all
the
town
knows
that
they
were
fabricated
by
grushina
at
your
wife
request
the
princess
knows
nothing
about
it
ask
anyone
you
like
everyone
knows
they
gave
the
thing
away
themselves
and
then
varvara
dmitrievna
stole
the
letters
from
you
and
burnt
them
so
as
to
leave
no
traces
dark
oppressive
thoughts
stirred
in
peredonov
brain
he
understood
only
one
thing
that
he
had
been
fooled
but
that
the
princess
knew
nothing
of
it
could
not
enter
his
head
yes
she
knew
no
wonder
she
had
come
out
of
the
fire
alive
it
a
lie
about
the
princess
he
said
i
tried
to
burn
the
princess
but
did
not
succeed
in
burning
her
up
she
spat
out
an
exorcism
suddenly
a
furious
rage
seized
peredonov
fooled
he
struck
the
table
savagely
with
his
fist
tore
himself
from
his
place
and
without
saying
to
vershina
walked
home
quickly
vershina
looked
after
him
with
malignant
joy
and
the
black
clouds
of
smoke
flew
quickly
from
her
dark
mouth
and
swirled
away
in
the
wind
rage
consumed
peredonov
but
when
he
saw
varvara
he
was
seized
with
a
painful
dread
which
prevented
him
from
uttering
a
word
on
the
next
morning
peredonov
got
ready
a
small
garden
knife
which
he
carefully
kept
in
a
leather
sheath
in
his
pocket
he
spent
the
whole
morning
until
luncheon
at
volodin
he
looked
at
volodin
working
and
made
absurd
remarks
volodin
was
glad
as
usual
that
peredonov
fussed
about
him
and
he
accepted
peredonov
silly
talk
as
wit
that
whole
day
the
nedotikomka
wheeled
around
peredonov
it
would
not
let
him
go
to
sleep
after
lunch
it
completely
tired
him
out
when
towards
evening
he
had
almost
fallen
asleep
he
was
awakened
by
a
mischievous
woman
who
appeared
from
some
place
unknown
to
him
she
was
amorphous
and
as
she
walked
up
to
his
bed
she
muttered
the
must
be
crushed
out
the
tarts
must
be
taken
out
of
the
oven
the
meat
must
be
roasted
her
cheeks
were
dark
but
her
teeth
gleamed
go
to
the
devil
shouted
peredonov
the
woman
disappeared
as
if
she
had
not
been
there
at
all
the
evening
came
a
melancholy
wind
blew
in
the
chimney
a
slow
rain
tapped
on
the
window
quietly
and
persistently
it
was
quite
black
outside
volodin
was
at
the
peredonovs
peredonov
had
invited
him
early
that
morning
to
the
supper
do
let
anyone
in
do
you
hear
klavdiushka
shouted
peredonov
varvara
smiled
peredonov
muttered
all
sorts
of
women
are
prowling
around
here
a
watch
should
be
kept
one
got
into
my
bedroom
she
asked
to
be
taken
on
as
cook
but
why
should
i
have
a
cook
volodin
laughed
bleatingly
and
said
there
are
women
walking
about
in
the
street
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
and
we
sha
let
them
join
us
at
our
table
the
three
of
them
sat
down
at
the
table
they
began
to
drink
vodka
and
to
eat
tarts
they
drank
more
than
they
ate
peredonov
was
gloomy
everything
had
already
become
a
senseless
and
incoherent
delirium
for
him
he
had
a
painful
headache
one
picture
repeated
itself
persistently
that
of
volodin
as
an
enemy
one
idea
importuned
and
assailed
him
ceaselessly
it
was
that
he
must
kill
pavloushka
before
it
was
too
late
and
then
all
the
inimical
cunning
would
become
revealed
as
for
volodin
he
was
rapidly
becoming
drunk
and
he
kept
up
an
incoherent
jabber
much
to
varvara
amusement
peredonov
seemed
restless
he
mumbled
someone
is
coming
do
let
anyone
in
tell
them
that
i
have
gone
away
to
pray
at
the
monastery
he
was
afraid
that
visitors
might
hinder
him
volodin
and
varvara
were
amused
they
thought
that
he
was
only
drunk
they
exchanged
winks
and
walked
out
separately
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
said
in
different
voices
is
general
peredonov
at
home
i
brought
general
peredonov
a
diamond
star
but
the
star
did
not
tempt
peredonov
that
evening
he
shouted
do
let
them
in
chuck
them
out
let
them
bring
it
in
the
morning
now
is
not
the
time
no
he
thought
i
need
all
my
strength
everything
will
be
revealed
but
until
then
my
enemies
are
ready
to
send
anything
and
everything
against
me
to
destroy
me
well
we
chased
them
away
they
bring
it
morning
said
volodin
as
he
seated
himself
once
more
at
the
table
peredonov
fixed
his
troubled
eyes
upon
him
and
asked
are
you
a
friend
to
me
or
an
enemy
a
friend
a
friend
ardasha
replied
volodin
a
friend
with
true
love
is
like
a
beetle
behind
the
stove
said
varvara
not
a
beetle
but
a
ram
corrected
peredonov
well

and
i
will
drink
together
pavloushka
only
we
two
and
you
varvara
drink
also
we
drink
together

volodin
said
with
a
snigger
if
varvara
dmitrievna
drinks
with
us
it
wo
be
two
but
three
two
i
say
repeated
peredonov
morosely
husband
and
wife
are
one
satan
said
varvara
and
began
to
laugh
volodin
did
not
suspect
to
the
last
minute
that
peredonov
wanted
to
kill
him
he
kept
on
bleating
making
a
fool
of
himself
and
uttering
nonsense
which
made
varvara
laugh
but
peredonov
did
not
forget
his
knife
the
whole
evening
when
volodin
or
varvara
walked
up
to
that
side
where
the
knife
was
hidden
peredonov
savagely
warned
them
off
sometimes
he
pointed
at
his
pocket
and
said
i
have
a
trick
here
pavloushka
that
will
make
you
quack
varvara
and
volodin
laughed
i
can
always
quack
ardasha
said
volodin
kra
kra
it
quite
easy
red
and
drunken
with
vodka
volodin
protruded
his
lips
and
quacked
he
became
more
and
more
arrogant
towards
peredonov
you
been
taken
in
ardasha
he
said
with
contemptuous
pity
i
take
you
in
bellowed
peredonov
in
fury
volodin
appeared
terrible
to
him
and
menacing
he
must
defend
himself
peredonov
quickly
pulled
out
his
knife
threw
himself
on
volodin
and
slashed
him
across
his
throat
the
blood
gushed
out
in
a
stream
peredonov
was
frightened
the
knife
fell
out
of
his
hands
volodin
kept
up
his
bleat
and
tried
to
catch
hold
of
his
throat
with
his
hands
it
was
evident
that
he
was
deadly
frightened
that
he
was
growing
weaker
and
that
his
hands
would
never
reach
his
throat
suddenly
he
grew
deathly
pale
and
fell
on
peredonov
there
was
a
broken
squeal
as
if
he
choked
then
he
was
silent
peredonov
cried
out
in
horror
and
varvara
after
him
peredonov
pushed
volodin
away
volodin
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
he
groaned
moved
his
feet
and
was
soon
dead
his
open
eyes
grew
glassy
and
their
fixed
stare
was
directed
upwards
the
cat
walked
out
of
the
next
room
smelt
the
blood
and
mewed
malignantly
varvara
stood
as
if
in
a
trance
klavdia
upon
hearing
the
noise
came
running
in
oh
lord
they
cut
his
throat
she
wailed
varvara
roused
herself
and
with
a
scream
rushed
from
the
together
with
klavdia
the
news
of
the
event
spread
quickly
the
neighbours
collected
in
the
street
and
in
the
garden
the
bolder
ones
went
into
the
house
they
did
not
venture
to
enter
the
for
some
time
they
peeped
in
and
whispered
peredonov
was
looking
at
the
corpse
with
his
vacant
eyes
and
listened
to
the
whispers
behind
the
door
a
dull
sadness
tormented
him
he
had
no
thoughts
at
last
they
grew
bolder
and
entered
peredonov
was
sitting
with
downcast
eyes
and
mumbling
incoherent
meaningless
words
tarakan
is
russian
for
blackbeetle
