a
treatise
on
good
works
together
with
the
letter
of
dedication
by
martin
luther
introduction
the
occasion
of
the
luther
did
not
impose
himself
as
reformer
upon
the
church
in
the
course
of
a
conscientious
performance
of
the
duties
of
his
office
to
which
he
had
been
regularly
and
divinely
called
and
without
any
urging
on
his
part
he
attained
to
this
position
by
inward
necessity
in
he
received
his
appointment
as
the
standing
substitute
for
the
sickly
city
pastor
simon
heinse
from
the
city
council
of
wittenberg
before
this
time
he
was
obliged
to
preach
only
occasionally
in
the
convent
apart
from
his
activity
as
teacher
in
the
university
and
convent
through
this
appointment
he
was
in
duty
bound
by
divine
and
human
right
to
lead
and
direct
the
congregation
at
wittenberg
on
the
true
way
to
life
and
it
would
have
been
a
denial
of
the
knowledge
of
salvation
which
god
had
led
him
to
acquire
by
way
of
ardent
inner
struggles
if
he
had
led
the
congregation
on
any
other
way
than
the
one
god
had
revealed
to
him
in
his
word
he
could
not
deny
before
the
congregation
which
had
been
intrusted
to
his
care
what
up
to
this
time
he
had
taught
with
ever
increasing
clearness
in
his
lectures
at
the
university
for
in
the
lectures
on
the
psalms
which
he
began
to
deliver
in
he
declares
his
conviction
that
faith
alone
justifies
as
can
be
seen
from
the
complete
manuscript
published
since
and
with
still
greater
clearness
from
his
commentary
on
the
epistle
to
the
romans
which
is
accessible
since
nor
what
he
had
urged
as
spiritual
adviser
of
his
convent
brethren
when
in
deep
distress
compare
the
charming
letter
to
georg
spenlein
dated
april
luther
first
literary
works
to
appear
in
print
were
also
occasioned
by
the
work
of
his
calling
and
of
his
office
in
the
wittenberg
congregation
he
had
no
other
object
in
view
than
to
edify
his
congregation
and
to
lead
it
to
christ
when
in
he
published
his
first
independent
work
the
explanation
of
the
seven
penitential
psalms
on
oct
of
the
same
year
he
published
his
theses
against
indulgences
these
were
indeed
intended
as
controversial
theses
for
theologians
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
well
known
that
luther
was
moved
by
his
duty
toward
his
congregation
to
declare
his
position
in
this
matter
and
to
put
in
issue
the
whole
question
as
to
the
right
and
wrong
of
indulgences
by
means
of
his
theses
his
sermon
of
indulgences
and
grace
occasioned
by
tetzel
attack
and
delivered
in
the
latter
part
of
march
as
well
as
his
sermon
of
penitence
delivered
about
the
same
time
were
also
intended
for
his
congregation
before
his
congregation
he
delivered
the
sermons
on
the
ten
commandments
which
were
published
in
and
the
sermons
on
the
lord
prayer
which
were
also
published
in
by
agricola
though
luther
in
the
same
year
published
a
series
of
controversial
writings
which
were
occasioned
by
attacks
from
outside
sources
the
resolutiones
disputationis
de
virtute
indulgentiarum
the
asterisci
adversus
obeliscos
joh
eccii
and
the
ad
dialogum
silv
prieriatis
responsio
still
he
never
was
diverted
by
this
necessary
rebuttal
from
his
paramount
duty
the
edification
of
the
congregation
the
autumn
of
the
year
when
he
was
confronted
with
cajetan
as
well
as
the
whole
year
of
when
he
held
his
disputations
with
eck
were
replete
with
disquietude
and
pressing
labors
still
luther
served
his
congregation
with
a
whole
series
of
writings
during
this
time
and
only
regretted
that
he
was
not
entirely
at
its
disposal
of
such
writings
we
mention
explanation
of
the
lord
prayer
for
the
simple
laity
an
elaboration
of
the
sermons

with
but
few
exceptions
these
writings
all
appeared
in
print
in
the
year
and
again
it
was
the
congregation
which
luther
sought
primarily
to
serve
if
the
bounds
of
his
congregation
spread
ever
wider
beyond
wittenberg
so
that
his
writings
found
a
surprisingly
ready
sale
even
afar
that
was
not
luther
fault
even
the
tessaradecas
consolatoria
written
in
and
printed
in
a
book
of
consolation
which
was
originally
intended
for
the
sick
elector
of
saxony
was
written
by
him
only
upon
solicitation
from
outside
sources
to
this
circle
of
writings
the
treatise
of
good
works
also
belongs
though
the
incentive
for
its
composition
came
from
george
spalatin
to
the
elector
who
reminded
luther
of
a
promise
he
had
given
still
luther
was
willing
to
undertake
it
only
when
he
recalled
that
in
a
previous
sermon
to
his
congregation
he
occasionally
had
made
a
similar
promise
to
deliver
a
sermon
on
good
works
and
when
luther
actually
commenced
the
composition
he
had
nothing
else
in
view
but
the
preparation
of
a
sermon
for
his
congregation
on
this
important
topic
but
while
the
work
was
in
progress
the
material
so
accumulated
that
it
far
outgrew
the
bounds
of
a
sermon
for
his
congregation
on
march
he
wrote
to
spalatin
that
it
would
become
a
whole
booklet
instead
of
a
sermon
on
may
he
again
emphasizes
the
growth
of
the
material
on
may
he
speaks
of
its
completion
at
an
early
date
and
on
june
he
could
send
melanchthon
a
printed
copy
it
was
entitled
von
den
guten
werckenn
vuittenberg
on
the
last
page
it
bore
the
mark
getruck
zu
wittenberg
bey
dem
iungen
melchior
lotther
im
tausent
funfhundert
vnnd
zweyntzigsten
jar
it
filled
not
less
than
leaves
quarto
in
spite
of
its
volume
however
the
intention
of
the
book
for
the
congregation
remained
now
however
not
only
for
the
narrow
circle
of
the
wittenberg
congregation
but
for
the
christian
layman
in
general
in
the
dedicatory
preface
luther
lays
the
greatest
stress
upon
this
for
he
writes
though
i
know
of
a
great
many
and
must
hear
it
daily
who
think
lightly
of
my
poverty
and
say
that
i
write
only
small
sexternlein
tracts
of
small
volume
and
german
sermons
for
the
untaught
laity
i
will
not
permit
that
to
move
me
would
to
god
that
during
my
life
i
had
served
but
one
layman
for
his
betterment
with
all
my
powers
it
would
be
sufficient
for
me
i
would
thank
god
and
suffer
all
my
books
to
perish
thereafter
most
willingly
i
will
leave
the
honor
of
greater
things
to
others
and
not
at
all
will
i
be
ashamed
of
preaching
and
writing
german
to
the
untaught
laity
since
luther
had
dedicated
the
tessaradecas
consolatoria
to
the
reigning
prince
he
now
probably
on
recommendation
dedicated
the
treatise
on
good
works
to
his
brother
john
who
afterward
in
succeeded
frederick
in
the
electorate
there
was
probably
good
reason
for
dedicating
the
book
to
a
member
of
the
reigning
house
princes
have
reason
to
take
a
special
interest
in
the
fact
that
preaching
on
good
works
should
occur
within
their
realm
for
the
safety
and
sane
development
of
their
kingdom
depend
largely
upon
the
cultivation
of
morality
on
the
part
of
their
subjects
time
and
again
the
papal
church
had
commended
herself
to
princes
and
statesmen
by
her
emphatic
teaching
of
good
works
luther
on
the
other
hand
had
been
accused
like
the
apostle
paul
before
him
rom
that
the
zealous
performance
of
good
works
had
abated
that
the
bonds
of
discipline
had
slackened
and
that
as
a
necessary
consequence
lawlessness
and
shameless
immorality
were
being
promoted
by
his
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
alone
before
the
rumor
had
already
spread
that
luther
intended
to
do
away
with
good
works
duke
george
of
saxony
had
received
no
good
impression
from
a
sermon
luther
had
delivered
at
dresden
because
he
feared
the
consequences
which
luther
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
alone
might
have
upon
the
morals
of
the
masses
under
these
circumstances
it
would
not
have
been
surprising
if
a
member
of
the
electoral
house
should
harbor
like
scruples
especially
since
the
full
comprehension
of
luther
preaching
on
good
works
depended
on
an
evangelical
understanding
of
faith
as
deep
as
was
luther
own
the
middle
ages
had
differentiated
between
fides
informis
a
formless
faith
and
fides
formata
or
informata
a
formed
or
ornate
faith
the
former
was
held
to
be
a
knowledge
without
any
life
or
effect
the
latter
to
be
identical
with
love
for
as
they
said
love
which
proves
itself
and
is
effective
in
good
works
must
be
added
to
the
formless
faith
as
its
complement
and
its
content
well
pleasing
to
god
in
luther
time
every
one
who
was
seriously
interested
in
religious
questions
was
reared
under
the
influence
of
these
ideas
now
since
luther
had
opposed
the
doctrine
of
justification
by
love
and
its
good
works
he
was
in
danger
of
being
misunderstood
by
strangers
as
though
he
held
the
bare
knowledge
and
assent
to
be
sufficient
for
justification
and
such
preaching
would
indeed
have
led
to
frivolity
and
disorderly
conduct
but
even
apart
from
the
question
whether
or
not
the
brother
of
the
elector
was
disturbed
by
such
scruples
luther
must
have
welcomed
the
opportunity
when
the
summons
came
to
him
to
dedicate
his
book
of
good
works
to
a
member
of
the
electoral
house
at
any
rate
the
book
could
serve
to
acquaint
him
with
the
thoughts
of
his
pastor
and
professor
at
wittenberg
for
never
before
had
luther
expressed
himself
on
the
important
question
of
good
works
in
such
a
fundamental
thorough
and
profound
way
the
contents
of
the
a
perusal
of
the
contents
shows
that
the
book
in
the
course
of
its
production
attained
a
greater
length
than
was
originally
intended
to
this
fact
it
must
be
attributed
that
a
new
numeration
of
sections
begins
with
the
argument
on
the
third
commandment
and
is
repeated
at
every
commandment
thereafter
while
before
this
the
sections
were
consecutively
numbered
but
in
spite
of
this
the
plan
of
the
whole
is
clear
and
lucid
evidently
the
whole
treatise
is
divided
into
two
parts
the
first
comprising
sections
while
the
second
comprises
all
the
following
sections
the
first
being
fundamental
is
the
more
important
part
luther
well
knew
of
the
charges
made
against
him
that
faith
is
so
highly
elevated
and
works
are
rejected
by
him
but
he
knew
too
that
neither
silver
gold
and
precious
stone
nor
any
other
precious
thing
had
experienced
so
much
augmentation
and
diminution
as
had
good
works
which
should
all
have
but
one
simple
goodness
or
they
are
nothing
but
color
glitter
and
deception
but
especially
was
he
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
church
was
urging
nothing
but
the
works
such
as
running
to
the
convent
singing
reading
playing
the
organ
saying
the
mass
praying
matins
vespers
and
other
hours
founding
and
ornamenting
churches
altars
convents
gathering
chimes
jewels
vestments
gems
and
treasures
going
to
rome
and
to
the
saints
curtsying
and
bowing
the
knees
praying
the
rosary
and
the
psalter
and
that
she
designated
these
alone
as
truly
good
works
while
she
represented
the
faithful
performance
of
the
duties
of
one
calling
as
a
morality
of
a
lower
order
for
these
reasons
it
is
luther
highest
object
in
this
treatise
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
what
is
the
essence
of
good
works
whenever
the
essence
of
good
works
has
been
understood
then
the
accusations
against
him
will
quickly
collapse
in
the
fundamental
part
he
therefore
argues
truly
good
works
are
not
works
of
monastic
or
any
other
holiness
but
such
only
as
god
has
commanded
and
as
are
comprehended
within
the
bounds
of
particular
calling
and
all
works
let
their
name
be
what
it
may
become
good
only
when
they
flow
from
faith
the
first
greatest
and
noblest
of
good
works
john
in
this
connection
the
essence
of
faith
that
only
source
of
all
truly
good
works
must
of
course
be
rightly
understood
it
is
the
sure
confidence
in
god
that
all
my
doing
is
wellpleasing
to
him
it
is
trust
in
his
mercy
even
though
he
appears
angry
and
puts
sufferings
and
adversities
upon
us
it
is
the
assurance
of
the
divine
good
will
even
though
god
should
reprove
the
conscience
with
sin
death
and
hell
and
deny
it
all
grace
and
mercy
as
though
he
would
condemn
and
show
his
wrath
eternally
where
such
faith
lives
in
the
heart
there
the
works
are
good
even
though
they
were
as
insignificant
as
the
picking
up
of
a
straw
but
where
it
is
wanting
there
are
only
such
works
as
heathen
jew
and
turk
may
have
and
do
where
such
faith
possesses
the
man
he
needs
no
teacher
in
good
works
as
little
as
does
the
husband
or
the
wife
who
only
look
for
love
and
favor
from
one
another
nor
need
any
instruction
therein
how
they
are
to
stand
toward
each
other
what
they
are
to
do
to
leave
undone
to
say
to
leave
unsaid
to
think
this
faith
luther
continues
is
the
true
fulfilment
of
the
first
commandment
apart
from
which
there
is
no
work
that
could
do
justice
to
this
commandment
with
this
sentence
he
combines
on
the
one
hand
the
whole
argument
on
faith
as
the
best
and
noblest
of
good
works
with
his
opening
proposition
there
are
no
good
works
besides
those
commanded
of
god
and
on
the
other
hand
he
prepares
the
way
for
the
following
argument
wherein
he
proposes
to
exhibit
the
good
works
according
to
the
ten
commandments
for
the
first
commandment
does
not
forbid
this
and
that
nor
does
it
require
this
and
that
it
forbids
but
one
thing
unbelief
it
requires
but
one
thing
faith
that
confidence
in
god
good
will
at
all
times
without
this
faith
the
best
works
are
as
nothing
and
if
man
should
think
that
by
them
he
could
be
to
god
he
would
be
lowering
god
to
the
level
of
a
broker
or
a
laborer
who
will
not
dispense
his
grace
and
kindness
gratis
this
understanding
of
faith
and
good
works
so
luther
now
addresses
his
opponents
should
in
fairness
be
kept
in
view
by
those
who
accuse
him
of
declaiming
against
good
works
and
they
should
learn
from
it
that
though
he
has
preached
against
good
works
it
was
against
such
as
are
falsely
so
called
and
as
contribute
toward
the
confusion
of
consciences
because
they
are
do
not
flow
from
faith
and
are
done
with
the
pretension
of
doing
works
to
god
this
brings
us
to
the
end
of
the
fundamental
part
of
the
treatise
it
was
not
luther
intention
however
to
speak
only
on
the
essence
of
good
works
and
their
fundamental
relation
to
faith
he
would
show
too
how
the
best
work
faith
must
prove
itself
in
every
way
a
living
faith
according
to
the
other
commandments
luther
does
not
proceed
to
this
part
however
until
in
the
fundamental
part
he
has
said
with
emphasis
that
the
believer
the
spiritual
man
needs
no
such
instruction
timothy
but
that
he
of
his
own
accord
and
at
all
times
does
good
works
as
his
faith
his
confidence
teaches
him
only
because
we
do
not
all
have
such
faith
or
are
unmindful
of
it
does
such
instruction
become
necessary
nor
does
he
proceed
until
he
has
applied
his
oft
repeated
words
concerning
the
relation
of
faith
to
good
works
to
the
relation
of
the
first
to
the
other
commandments
from
the
fact
that
according
to
the
first
commandment
we
acquire
a
pure
heart
and
confidence
toward
god
he
derives
the
good
work
of
the
second
commandment
namely
to
praise
god
to
acknowledge
his
grace
to
render
all
honor
to
him
alone
from
the
same
source
he
derives
the
good
work
of
the
third
commandment
namely
to
observe
divine
services
with
prayer
and
the
hearing
of
preaching
to
incline
the
imagination
of
our
hearts
toward
benefits
and
to
that
end
to
mortify
and
overcome
the
flesh
from
the
same
source
he
derives
the
works
of
the
second
table
the
argument
on
the
third
and
fourth
commandments
claims
nearly
of
the
entire
treatise
among
the
good
works
which
according
to
the
third
commandment
should
be
an
exercise
and
proof
of
faith
luther
especially
mentions
the
proper
hearing
of
mass
and
of
preaching
common
prayer
bodily
discipline
and
the
mortification
of
the
flesh
and
he
joins
the
former
and
the
latter
by
an
important
fundamental
discussion
of
the
new
testament
conception
of
sabbath
rest
luther
discusses
the
fourth
commandment
as
fully
as
the
third
the
exercise
of
faith
according
to
this
commandment
consists
in
the
faithful
performance
of
the
duties
of
children
toward
their
parents
of
parents
toward
their
children
and
of
subordinates
toward
their
superiors
in
the
ecclesiastical
as
well
as
in
the
common
civil
sphere
the
various
duties
issue
from
the
various
callings
for
faithful
performance
of
the
duties
of
one
calling
with
the
help
of
god
and
for
god
sake
is
the
true
good
work
as
he
now
proceeds
to
speak
of
the
spiritual
powers
the
government
of
the
church
he
frankly
reveals
their
faults
and
demands
a
reform
of
the
present
rulers
honor
and
obedience
in
all
things
should
be
rendered
unto
the
church
the
spiritual
mother
as
it
is
due
to
natural
parents
unless
it
be
contrary
to
the
first
three
commandments
but
as
matters
stand
now
the
spiritual
magistrates
neglect
their
peculiar
work
namely
the
fostering
of
godliness
and
discipline
like
a
mother
who
runs
away
from
her
children
and
follows
a
lover
and
instead
they
undertake
strange
and
evil
works
like
parents
whose
commands
are
contrary
to
god
in
this
case
members
of
the
church
must
do
as
godly
children
do
whose
parents
have
become
mad
and
insane
kings
princes
the
nobility
municipalities
and
communities
must
begin
of
their
own
accord
and
put
a
check
to
these
conditions
so
that
the
bishops
and
the
clergy
who
are
now
too
timid
may
be
induced
to
follow
but
even
the
civil
magistrates
must
also
suffer
reforms
to
be
enacted
in
their
particular
spheres
especially
are
they
called
on
to
do
away
with
the
rude
gluttony
and
drunkenness
luxury
in
clothing
the
usurious
sale
of
rents
and
the
common
brothels
this
by
divine
and
human
right
is
a
part
of
their
enjoined
works
according
to
the
fourth
commandment
luther
at
last
briefly
treats
of
the
second
table
of
the
commandments
but
in
speaking
of
the
works
of
these
commandments
he
never
forgets
to
point
out
their
relation
to
faith
thus
holding
fast
this
fundamental
thought
of
the
book
to
the
end
faith
which
does
not
doubt
that
god
is
gracious
he
says
will
find
it
an
easy
matter
to
be
graciously
and
favorably
minded
toward
one
neighbor
and
to
overcome
all
angry
and
wrathful
desires
in
this
faith
in
god
the
spirit
will
teach
us
to
avoid
unchaste
thoughts
and
thus
to
keep
the
sixth
commandment
when
the
heart
trusts
in
the
divine
favor
it
can
not
seek
after
the
temporal
goods
of
others
nor
cleave
to
money
but
according
to
the
seventh
commandment
will
use
it
with
cheerful
liberality
for
the
benefit
of
the
neighbor
where
such
confidence
is
present
there
is
also
a
courageous
strong
and
intrepid
heart
which
will
at
all
times
defend
the
truth
as
the
eighth
commandment
demands
whether
neck
or
coat
be
at
stake
whether
it
be
against
pope
or
kings
where
such
faith
is
present
there
is
also
strife
against
the
evil
lust
as
forbidden
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
commandments
and
that
even
unto
death
the
importance
of
the
inquiring
now
into
the
importance
of
the
book
we
note
that
luther
impression
evidently
was
perfectly
correct
when
he
wrote
to
spalatin
long
before
its
completion
as
early
as
march
that
he
believed
it
to
be
better
than
anything
he
had
heretofore
written
the
book
indeed
surpasses
all
his
previous
german
writings
in
volume
as
well
as
all
his
latin
and
german
ones
in
clearness
richness
and
the
fundamental
importance
of
its
content
in
comparison
with
the
prevalent
urging
of
works
of
monkish
holiness
which
had
arisen
from
a
complete
misunderstanding
of
the
evangelical
counsels
comp
esp
matthew
and
which
were
at
that
time
accepted
as
and
zealously
urged
by
the
whole
church
luther
argument
must
have
appeared
to
all
thoughtful
and
earnest
souls
as
a
revelation
when
he
so
clearly
amplified
the
proposition
that
only
those
works
are
to
be
regarded
as
good
works
which
god
has
commanded
and
that
therefore
not
the
abandoning
of
one
earthly
calling
but
the
faithful
keeping
of
the
ten
commandments
in
the
course
of
one
calling
is
the
work
which
god
requires
of
us
over
against
the
opinion
as
though
the
will
of
god
as
declared
in
the
ten
commandments
referred
only
to
the
outward
work
always
especially
mentioned
luther
argument
must
have
called
to
mind
the
explanation
of
the
law
which
the
lord
had
given
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
when
he
taught
men
to
recognize
only
the
extreme
point
and
manifestation
of
a
whole
trend
of
thought
in
the
work
prohibited
by
the
text
and
when
he
directed
christians
not
to
rest
in
the
keeping
of
the
literal
requirement
of
each
commandment
but
from
this
point
of
vantage
to
inquire
into
the
whole
depth
and
breadth
of
god
will
positively
and
negatively
and
to
do
his
will
in
its
full
extent
as
the
heart
has
perceived
it
though
this
thought
may
have
been
occasionally
expressed
in
the
expositions
of
the
ten
commandments
which
appeared
at
the
dawn
of
the
reformation
still
it
had
never
before
been
so
clearly
recognized
as
the
only
correct
principle
much
less
had
it
been
so
energetically
carried
out
from
beginning
to
end
as
is
done
in
this
treatise
over
against
the
view
that
the
works
of
love
must
bestow
upon
faith
its
form
its
content
and
its
worth
before
god
it
must
have
appeared
as
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
galatians
when
luther
in
this
treatise
declared
and
with
victorious
certainty
carried
out
the
thought
that
it
is
true
faith
which
invests
the
works
even
the
best
and
greatest
of
works
with
their
content
and
worth
before
god
this
proposition
which
luther
here
amplifies
more
clearly
than
ever
before
demanded
nothing
less
than
a
breach
with
the
whole
of
prevalent
religious
views
and
at
that
time
must
have
been
perceived
as
the
discovery
of
a
new
world
though
it
was
no
more
than
a
return
to
the
clear
teaching
of
the
new
testament
scriptures
concerning
the
way
of
salvation
this
too
accounts
for
the
fact
that
in
this
writing
the
accusation
is
more
impressively
repelled
than
before
that
the
doctrine
of
justification
by
faith
alone
resulted
in
moral
laxity
and
that
on
the
other
hand
the
fundamental
and
radical
importance
of
righteousness
by
faith
for
the
whole
moral
life
is
revealed
in
such
a
manner
luther
appeal
in
this
treatise
to
kings
princes
the
nobility
municipalities
and
communities
to
declare
against
the
misuse
of
spiritual
powers
and
to
abolish
various
abuses
in
civil
life
marks
this
treatise
as
a
forerunner
of
the
great
reformation
writings
which
appeared
in
the
same
year
while
on
the
other
hand
his
espousal
of
the
rights
of
the
poor
man
to
be
met
with
here
for
the
first
time
shows
that
the
monk
of
witttenberg
coming
from
the
narrow
limits
of
the
convent
had
an
intimate
and
sympathetic
knowledge
of
the
social
needs
of
his
time
thus
he
proved
by
his
own
example
that
to
take
a
stand
in
the
center
of
the
gospel
does
not
narrow
the
vision
nor
harden
the
heart
but
rather
produces
courage
in
the
truth
and
sympathy
for
all
manner
of
misery
luther
contemporaries
at
once
recognized
the
great
importance
of
the
treatise
for
within
the
period
of
seven
months
it
passed
through
eight
editions
these
were
followed
by
six
more
editions
between
the
years
of
and
in
it
was
translated
into
latin
and
in
this
form
passed
through
three
editions
up
to
the
year
and
all
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
those
years
the
three
great
reformation
writings
of
were
casting
all
else
into
the
shadow
melanchthon
in
a
contemporaneous
letter
to
john
hess
called
it
luther
best
book
john
mathesius
the
pastor
at
joachimsthal
and
luther
biographer
acknowledged
that
he
had
learned
the
rudiments
of
christianity
from
it
even
this
book
has
its
peculiar
mission
to
the
church
the
seeking
after
works
the
indolence
regarding
the
works
commanded
of
god
the
foolish
opinion
that
the
path
of
works
leads
to
god
grace
and
are
even
widely
prevalent

toward
your

by
the

of
some
such

wares
as
are

disposal
but
i
have
always
considered
my
powers
too
feeble
to
undertake

worthy
of

to
your

however
my

to

like
the
princely

may
be

you
especially
in
gracious
kindness
and

i
have
hoped
that
your
princely

likewise
would
not
despise
this
my
humble
offering
which
i
have
felt
more
need
of
publishing
than
an
other
of
my
sermons
or
tracts
for
the
greatest
of
all
questions
has
been
raised
the
question
of
good
works
in
which
is
practised
immeasurably
more
trickery
and
deception
than
in
anything
else
and
in
which
the
simpleminded
man
is
so
easily
misled
that
our
lord
christ
has
commanded
us
to
watch
carefully
for
the
sheep
clothings
under
which
the
wolves
hide
themselves
neither
silver
gold
precious
stones
nor
any
rare
thing
has
such
manifold
alloys
and
flaws
as
have
good
works
which
ought
to
have
a
single
simple
goodness
and
without
it
are
mere
color
show
and
deceit
and
although
i
know
and
daily
hear
many
people
who
think
slightingly
of
my
poverty
and
say
that
i
write
only
little
pamphlets
and
german
sermons
for
the
unlearned
laity
this
shall
not
disturb
me
would
to
god
i
had
in
all
my
life
with
all
the
ability
i
have
helped
one
layman
to
be
better
i
would
be
satisfied
thank
god
and
be
quite
willing
then
to
let
all
my
little
books
perish
whether
the
making
of
many
great
books
is
an
art
and
a
benefit
to
the
church
i
leave
others
to
judge
but
i
believe
that
if
i
were
minded
to
make
great
books
according
to
their
art
i
could
with
god
help
do
it
more
readily
perhaps
than
they
could
prepare
a
little
discourse
after
my
fashion
if
accomplishment
were
as
easy
as
persecution
christ
would
long
since
have
been
cast
out
of
heaven
again
and
god
throne
itself
overturned
although
we
can
not
all
be
writers
we
all
want
to
be
critics
i
will
most
gladly
leave
to
any
one
else
the
honor
of
greater
things
and
not
be
at
all
ashamed
to
preach
and
to
write
in
german
for
the
unlearned
laymen
although
i
too
have
little
skill
in
it
i
believe
that
if
we
had
hitherto
done
and
should
henceforth
do
more
of
it
christendom
would
have
reaped
no
small
advantage
and
have
been
more
bene
fited
by
this
than
by
the
great
deep
books
and
quaestiones
which
are
used
only
in
the
schools
among
the
learned
then
too
i
have
never
forced
or
begged
any
one
to
hear
me
or
to
read
my
sermons
i
have
freely
ministered
in
the
church
of
that
which
god
has
given
me
and
which
i
owe
the
church
whoever
likes
it
not
may
hear
and
read
what
others
have
to
say
and
if
they
are
not
willing
to
be
my
debtors
it
matters
little
for
me
it
is
enough
and
even
more
than
too
much
that
some
laymen
condescend
to
read
what
i
say
even
though
there
were
nothing
else
to
urge
me
it
should
be
more
than
sufficient
that
i
have
learned
that
your
princely
grace
is
pleased
with
such
german
books
and
is
eager
to
receive
instruction
in
good
works
and
the
faith
with
which
instruction
it
was
my
duty
humbly
and
with
all
diligence
to
serve
you
therefore
in
dutiful
humility
i
pray
that
your
princely
grace
may
accept
this
offering
of
mine
with
a
gracious
mind
until
if
god
grant
me
time
i
prepare
a
german
exposition
of
the
faith
in
its
entirety
for
at
this
time
i
have
wished
to
show
how
in
all
good
works
we
should
practice
and
make
use
of
faith
and
let
faith
be
the
chief
work
if
god
permit
i
will
treat
at
another
time
of
the
faith
itself
how
we
are
daily
to
pray
or
recite
it
i
humbly
commend
myself
herewith
to
your
princely
grace
your
princely
grace
humble
chaplain
martin
luther
from
wittenberg
march
the
treatise
i
we
ought
first
to
know
that
there
are
no
good
works
except
those
which
god
has
commanded
even
as
there
is
no
sin
except
that
which
god
has
forbidden
therefore
whoever
wishes
to
know
and
to
do
good
works
needs
nothing
else
than
to
know
god
commandments
thus
christ
says
matthew
xix
if
thou
wilt
enter
into
life
keep
the
commandments
and
when
the
young
man
asks
him
matthew
xix
what
he
shall
do
that
he
may
inherit
eternal
life
christ
sets
before
him
naught
else
but
the
ten
commandments
accordingly
we
must
learn
how
to
distinguish
among
good
works
from
the
commandments
of
god
and
not
from
the
appearance
the
magnitude
or
the
number
of
the
works
themselves
nor
from
the
judgment
of
men
or
of
human
law
or
custom
as
we
see
has
been
done
and
still
is
done
because
we
are
blind
and
despise
the
divine
commandments
ii
the
first
and
highest
the
most
precious
of
all
good
works
is
faith
in
christ
as
he
says
john
vi
when
the
jews
asked
him
what
shall
we
do
that
we
may
work
the
works
of
god
he
answered
this
is
the
work
of
god
that
ye
believe
on
him
whom
he
hath
sent
when
we
hear
or
preach
this
word
we
hasten
over
it
and
deem
it
a
very
little
thing
and
easy
to
do
whereas
we
ought
here
to
pause
a
long
time
and
to
ponder
it
well
for
in
this
work
all
good
works
must
be
done
and
receive
from
it
the
inflow
of
their
goodness
like
a
loan
this
we
must
put
bluntly
that
men
may
understand
it
we
find
many
who
pray
fast
establish
endowments
do
this
or
that
lead
a
good
life
before
men
and
yet
if
you
should
ask
them
whether
they
are
sure
that
what
they
do
pleases
god
they
say
no
they
do
not
know
or
they
doubt
and
there
are
some
very
learned
men
who
mislead
them
and
say
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
be
sure
of
this
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
these
same
men
do
nothing
else
but
teach
good
works
now
all
these
works
are
done
outside
of
faith
therefore
they
are
nothing
and
altogether
dead
for
as
their
conscience
stands
toward
god
and
as
it
believes
so
also
are
the
works
which
grow
out
of
it
now
they
have
no
faith
no
good
conscience
toward
god
therefore
the
works
lack
their
head
and
all
their
life
and
goodness
is
nothing
hence
it
comes
that
when
i
exalt
faith
and
reject
such
works
done
without
faith
they
accuse
me
of
forbidding
good
works
when
in
truth
i
am
trying
hard
to
teach
real
good
works
of
faith
iii
if
you
ask
further
whether
they
count
it
also
a
good
work
when
they
work
at
their
trade
walk
stand
eat
drink
sleep
and
do
all
kinds
of
works
for
the
nourishment
of
the
body
or
for
the
common
welfare
and
whether
they
believe
that
god
takes
pleasure
in
them
because
of
such
works
you
will
find
that
they
say
no
and
they
define
good
works
so
narrowly
that
they
are
made
to
consist
only
of
praying
in
church
fasting
and
almsgiving
other
works
they
consider
to
be
in
vain
and
think
that
god
cares
nothing
for
them
so
through
their
damnable
unbelief
they
curtail
and
lessen
the
service
of
god
who
is
served
by
all
things
whatsoever
that
are
done
spoken
or
thought
in
faith
so
teaches
ecclesiastes
ix
go
thy
way
with
joy
eat
and
drink
and
know
that
god
accepteth
thy
works
let
thy
garments
be
always
white
and
let
thy
head
lack
no
ointment
live
joyfully
with
the
wife
whom
thou
lovest
all
the
days
of
the
life
of
thy
vanity
let
thy
garments
be
always
white
that
is
let
all
our
works
be
good
whatever
they
may
be
without
any
distinction
and
they
are
white
when
i
am
certain
and
believe
that
they
please
god
then
shall
the
head
of
my
soul
never
lack
the
ointment
of
a
joyful
conscience
so
christ
says
john
viii
i
do
always
those
things
that
please
him
and
john
says
john
iii
hereby
we
know
that
we
are
of
the
truth
if
we
can
comfort
our
hearts
before
him
and
have
a
good
confidence
and
if
our
heart
condemns
or
frets
us
god
is
greater
than
our
heart
and
we
have
confidence
that
whatsoever
we
ask
we
shall
receive
of
him
because
we
keep
his
commandments
and
do
those
things
that
are
pleasing
in
his
sight
again
whosoever
is
born
of
god
that
is
whoever
believes
and
trusts
god
doth
not
commit
sin
and
can
not
sin
again
psalm
xxxiv
none
of
them
that
trust
in
him
shall
do
sin
and
in
psalm
ii
blessed
are
all
they
that
put
their
trust
in
him
if
this
be
true
then
all
that
they
do
must
be
good
or
the
evil
that
they
do
must
be
quickly
forgiven
behold
then
why
i
exalt
faith
so
greatly
draw
all
works
into
it
and
reject
all
works
which
do
not
flow
from
it
iv
now
every
one
can
note
and
tell
for
himself
when
he
does
what
is
good
or
what
is
not
good
for
if
he
finds
his
heart
confident
that
it
pleases
god
the
work
is
good
even
if
it
were
so
small
a
thing
as
picking
up
a
straw
if
confidence
is
absent
or
if
he
doubts
the
work
is
not
good
although
it
should
raise
all
the
dead
and
the
man
should
give
himself
to
be
burned
this
is
the
teaching
of
paul
romans
xiv
whatsoever
is
not
done
of
or
in
faith
is
sin
faith
as
the
chief
work
and
no
other
work
has
given
us
the
name
of
believers
on
christ
for
all
other
works
a
heathen
a
jew
a
turk
a
sinner
may
also
do
but
to
trust
firmly
that
he
pleases
god
is
possible
only
for
a
christian
who
is
enlightened
and
strengthened
by
grace
that
these
words
seem
strange
and
that
some
call
me
a
heretic
because
of
them
is
due
to
the
fact
that
men
have
followed
blind
reason
and
heathen
ways
have
set
faith
not
above
but
beside
other
virtues
and
have
given
it
a
work
of
its
own
apart
from
all
works
of
the
other
virtues
although
faith
alone
makes
all
other
works
good
acceptable
and
worthy
in
that
it
trusts
god
and
does
not
doubt
that
for
it
all
things
that
a
man
does
are
well
done
indeed
they
have
not
let
faith
remain
a
work
but
have
made
a
habitus
of
it
as
they
say
although
scripture
gives
the
name
of
a
good
divine
work
to
no
work
except
to
faith
alone
therefore
it
is
no
wonder
that
they
have
become
blind
and
leaders
of
the
blind
and
this
faith
brings
with
it
at
once
love
peace
joy
and
hope
for
god
gives
his
spirit
at
once
to
him
who
trusts
him
as
paul
says
to
the
galatians
you
received
the
spirit
not
because
of
your
good
works
but
when
you
believed
the
word
of
god
in
this
faith
all
works
become
equal
and
one
is
like
the
other
all
distinctions
between
works
fall
away
whether
they
be
great
small
short
long
few
or
many
for
the
works
are
acceptable
not
for
their
own
sake
but
because
of
the
faith
which
alone
is
works
and
lives
in
each
and
every
work
without
distinction
however
numerous
and
various
they
are
just
as
all
the
members
of
the
body
live
work
and
have
their
name
from
the
head
and
without
the
head
no
member
can
live
work
and
have
a
name
from
which
it
further
follows
that
a
christian
who
lives
in
this
faith
has
no
need
of
a
teacher
of
good
works
but
whatever
he
finds
to
do
he
does
and
all
is
well
done
as
samuel
said
to
saul
the
spirit
of
the
lord
will
come
upon
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
turned
into
another
man
then
do
thou
as
occasion
serves
thee
for
god
is
with
thee
so
also
we
read
of
anna
samuel
mother
when
she
believed
the
priest
eli
who
promised
her
god
grace
she
went
home
in
joy
and
peace
and
from
that
time
no
more
turned
hither
and
thither
that
is
whatever
occurred
it
was
all
one
to
her
paul
also
says
where
the
spirit
of
christ
is
there
all
is
free
for
faith
does
not
permit
itself
to
be
bound
to
any
work
nor
does
it
allow
any
work
to
be
taken
from
it
but
as
the
first
psalm
says
he
bringeth
forth
his
fruit
in
his
season
that
is
as
a
matter
of
course
vi
this
we
may
see
in
a
common
human
example
when
a
man
and
a
woman
love
and
are
pleased
with
each
other
and
thoroughly
believe
in
their
love
who
teaches
them
how
they
are
to
behave
what
they
are
to
do
leave
undone
say
not
say
think
confidence
alone
teaches
them
all
this
and
more
they
make
no
difference
in
works
they
do
the
great
the
long
the
much
as
gladly
as
the
small
the
short
the
little
and
vice
versa
and
that
too
with
joyful
peaceful
confident
hearts
and
each
is
a
free
companion
of
the
other
but
where
there
is
a
doubt
search
is
made
for
what
is
best
then
a
distinction
of
works
is
imagined
whereby
a
man
may
win
favor
and
yet
he
goes
about
it
with
a
heavy
heart
and
great
disrelish
he
is
as
it
were
taken
captive
more
than
half
in
despair
and
often
makes
a
fool
of
himself
so
a
christian
who
lives
in
this
confidence
toward
god
a
knows
all
things
can
do
all
things
undertakes
all
things
that
are
to
be
done
and
does
everything
cheerfully
and
freely
not
that
he
may
gather
many
merits
and
good
works
but
because
it
is
a
pleasure
for
him
to
please
god
thereby
and
he
serves
god
purely
for
nothing
content
that
his
service
pleases
god
on
the
other
hand
he
who
is
not
at
one
with
god
or
doubts
hunts
and
worries
in
what
way
he
may
do
enough
and
with
many
works
move
god
he
runs
to
james
of
compostella
to
rome
to
jerusalem
hither
and
yon
prays
bridget
prayer
and
the
rest
fasts
on
this
day
and
on
that
makes
confession
here
and
makes
confession
there
questions
this
man
and
that
and
yet
finds
no
peace
he
does
all
this
with
great
effort
despair
and
disrelish
of
heart
so
that
the
scriptures
rightly
call
such
works
in
hebrew
avenama
that
is
labor
and
travail
and
even
then
they
are
not
good
works
and
are
all
lost
many
have
been
crazed
thereby
their
fear
has
brought
them
into
all
manner
of
misery
of
these
it
is
written
wisdom
of
solomon
v
we
have
wearied
ourselves
in
the
wrong
way
and
have
gone
through
deserts
where
there
lay
no
way
but
as
for
the
way
of
the
lord
we
have
not
known
it
and
the
sun
of
righteousness
rose
not
upon
us
vii
in
these
works
faith
is
still
slight
and
weak
let
us
ask
further
whether
they
believe
that
they
are
to
god
when
they
suffer
in
body
property
honor
friends
or
whatever
they
have
and
believe
that
god
of
his
mercy
appoints
their
sufferings
and
difficulties
for
them
whether
they
be
small
or
great
this
is
real
strength
to
trust
in
god
when
to
all
our
senses
and
reason
he
appears
to
be
angry
and
to
have
greater
confidence
in
him
than
we
feel
here
he
is
hidden
as
the
bride
says
in
the
song
of
songs
behold
he
standeth
behind
our
wall
he
looketh
forth
at
the
windows
that
is
he
stands
hidden
among
the
sufferings
which
would
separate
us
from
him
like
a
wall
yea
like
a
wall
of
stone
and
yet
he
looks
upon
me
and
does
not
leave
me
for
he
is
standing
and
is
ready
graciously
to
help
and
through
the
window
of
dim
faith
he
permits
himself
to
be
seen
and
jeremiah
says
in
lamentations
he
casts
off
men
but
he
does
it
not
willingly
this
faith
they
do
not
know
at
all
and
give
up
thinking
that
god
has
forsaken
them
and
is
become
their
enemy
they
even
lay
the
blame
of
their
ills
on
men
and
devils
and
have
no
confidence
at
all
in
god
for
this
reason
too
their
suffering
is
always
an
offence
and
harmful
to
them
and
yet
they
go
and
do
some
good
works
as
they
think
and
are
not
aware
of
their
unbelief
but
they
who
in
such
suffering
trust
god
and
retain
a
good
firm
confidence
in
him
and
believe
that
he
is
pleased
with
them
these
see
in
their
sufferings
and
afflictions
nothing
but
precious
merits
and
the
rarest
possessions
the
value
of
which
no
one
can
estimate
for
faith
and
confidence
make
precious
before
god
all
that
which
others
think
most
shameful
so
that
it
is
written
even
of
death
in
psalm
cxvi
precious
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
is
the
death
of
his
saints
and
just
as
the
confidence
and
faith
are
better
higher
and
stronger
at
this
stage
than
in
the
first
stage
so
and
to
the
same
degree
do
the
sufferings
which
are
borne
in
this
faith
excel
all
works
of
faith
therefore
between
such
works
and
sufferings
there
is
an
immeasurable
difference
and
the
sufferings
are
infinitely
better
viii
beyond
all
this
is
the
highest
stage
of
faith
when
god
punishes
the
conscience
not
only
with
temporal
sufferings
but
with
death
hell
and
sin
and
refuses
grace
and
mercy
as
though
it
were
his
will
to
condemn
and
to
be
angry
eternally
this
few
men
experience
but
david
cries
out
in
psalm
vi
o
lord
rebuke
me
not
in
thine
anger
to
believe
at
such
times
that
god
in
his
mercy
is
pleased
with
us
is
the
highest
work
that
can
be
done
by
and
in
the
creature
but
of
this
the
and
doers
of
good
works
know
nothing
at
all
for
how
could
they
here
look
for
good
things
and
grace
from
god
as
long
as
they
are
not
certain
in
their
works
and
doubt
even
on
the
lowest
step
of
faith
in
this
way
i
have
as
i
said
always
praised
faith
and
rejected
all
works
which
are
done
without
such
faith
in
order
thereby
to
lead
men
from
the
false
pretentious
pharisaic
unbelieving
good
works
with
which
all
monastic
houses
churches
homes
low
and
higher
classes
are
overfilled
and
lead
them
to
the
true
genuine
thoroughly
good
believing
works
in
this
no
one
opposes
me
except
the
unclean
beasts
which
do
not
divide
the
hoof
as
the
law
of
moses
decrees
who
will
suffer
no
distinction
among
good
works
but
go
lumbering
along
if
only
they
pray
fast
establish
endowments
go
to
confession
and
do
enough
everything
shall
be
good
although
in
all
this
they
have
had
no
faith
in
god
grace
and
approval
indeed
they
consider
the
works
best
of
all
when
they
have
done
many
great
and
long
works
without
any
such
confidence
and
they
look
for
good
only
after
the
works
are
done
and
so
they
build
their
confidence
not
on
divine
favor
but
on
the
works
they
have
done
that
is
on
sand
and
water
from
which
they
must
at
last
take
a
cruel
fall
as
christ
says
matthew
vii
this
and
favor
on
which
our
confidence
rests
was
proclaimed
by
the
angels
from
heaven
when
they
sang
on
christmas
night
gloria
in
excelsis
deo
glory
to
god
in
the
highest
peace
to
earth
gracious
favor
to
man
ix
now
this
is
the
work
of
the
first
commandment
which
commands
thou
shalt
have
no
other
gods
which
means
since
i
alone
am
god
thou
shalt
place
all
thy
confidence
trust
and
faith
on
me
alone
and
on
no
one
else
for
that
is
not
to
have
a
god
if
you
call
him
god
only
with
your
lips
or
worship
him
with
the
knees
or
bodily
gestures
but
if
you
trust
him
with
the
heart
and
look
to
him
for
all
good
grace
and
favor
whether
in
works
or
sufferings
in
life
or
death
in
joy
or
sorrow
as
the
lord
christ
says
to
the
heathen
woman
john
iv
i
say
unto
thee
they
that
worship
god
must
worship
him
in
spirit
and
in
truth
and
this
faith
faithfulness
confidence
deep
in
the
heart
is
the
true
fulfilling
of
the
first
commandment
without
this
there
is
no
other
work
that
is
able
to
satisfy
this
commandment
and
as
this
commandment
is
the
very
first
highest
and
best
from
which
all
the
others
proceed
in
which
they
exist
and
by
which
they
are
directed
and
measured
so
also
its
work
that
is
the
faith
or
confidence
in
favor
at
all
times
is
the
very
first
highest
and
best
from
which
all
others
must
proceed
exist
remain
be
directed
and
measured
compared
with
this
other
works
are
just
as
if
the
other
commandments
were
without
the
first
and
there
were
no
god
therefore
augustine
well
says
that
the
works
of
the
first
commandment
are
faith
hope
and
love
as
i
said
above
such
faith
and
confidence
bring
love
and
hope
with
them
nay
if
we
see
it
aright
love
is
the
first
or
comes
at
the
same
instant
with
faith
for
i
could
not
trust
god
if
i
did
not
think
that
he
wished
to
be
favorable
and
to
love
me
which
leads
me
in
turn
to
love
him
and
to
trust
him
heartily
and
to
look
to
him
for
all
good
things
x
now
you
see
for
yourself
that
all
those
who
do
not
at
at
all
times
trust
god
and
do
not
in
all
their
works
or
sufferings
life
and
death
trust
in
his
favor
grace
and
but
seek
his
favor
in
other
things
or
in
themselves
do
not
keep
this
commandment
and
practise
real
idolatry
even
if
they
were
to
do
the
works
of
all
the
other
commandments
and
in
addition
had
all
the
prayers
fasting
obedience
patience
chastity
and
innocence
of
all
the
saints
combined
for
the
chief
work
is
not
present
without
which
all
the
others
are
nothing
but
mere
sham
show
and
pretence
with
nothing
back
of
them
against
which
christ
warns
us
matthew
vii
beware
of
false
prophets
which
come
to
you
in
sheep
clothing
such
are
all
who
wish
with
their
many
good
works
as
they
say
to
make
god
favorable
to
themselves
and
to
buy
god
grace
from
him
as
if
he
were
a
huckster
or
a
unwilling
to
give
his
grace
and
favor
for
nothing
these
are
the
most
perverse
people
on
earth
who
will
hardly
or
never
be
converted
to
the
right
way
such
too
are
all
who
in
adversity
run
hither
and
thither
and
look
for
counsel
and
help
everywhere
except
from
god
from
whom
they
are
most
urgently
commanded
to
seek
it
whom
the
prophet
isaiah
reproves
thus
isaiah
ix
the
mad
people
turneth
not
to
him
that
smiteth
them
that
is
god
smote
them
and
sent
them
sufferings
and
all
kinds
of
adversity
that
they
should
run
to
him
and
trust
him
but
they
run
away
from
him
to
men
now
to
egypt
now
to
assyria
perchance
also
to
the
devil
and
of
such
idolatry
much
is
written
in
the
same
prophet
and
in
the
books
of
the
kings
this
is
also
the
way
of
all
holy
hypocrites
when
they
are
in
trouble
they
do
not
run
to
god
but
flee
from
him
and
only
think
of
how
they
may
get
rid
of
their
trouble
through
their
own
efforts
or
through
human
help
and
yet
they
consider
themselves
and
let
others
consider
them
pious
people
xi
this
is
what
paul
means
in
many
places
where
he
ascribes
so
much
to
faith
that
he
says
justus
ex
fide
sua
vivit
the
righteous
man
draws
his
life
out
of
his
faith
and
faith
is
that
because
of
which
he
is
counted
righteous
before
god
if
righteousness
consists
of
faith
it
is
clear
that
faith
fulfils
all
commandments
and
makes
all
works
righteous
since
no
one
is
justified
except
he
keep
all
the
commands
of
god
again
the
works
can
justify
no
one
before
god
without
faith
so
utterly
and
roundly
does
the
apostle
reject
works
and
praise
faith
that
some
have
taken
offence
at
his
words
and
say
well
then
we
will
do
no
more
good
works
although
he
condemns
such
men
as
erring
and
foolish
so
men
still
do
when
we
reject
the
great
pretentious
works
of
our
time
which
are
done
entirely
without
faith
they
say
men
are
only
to
believe
and
not
to
do
anything
good
for
nowadays
they
say
that
the
works
of
the
first
commandment
are
singing
reading
reading
the
mass
saying
matins
and
vespers
and
the
other
hours
the
founding
and
decorating
of
churches
altars
and
monastic
houses
the
gathering
of
bells
jewels
garments
trinkets
and
treasures
running
to
rome
and
to
the
saints
further
when
we
are
dressed
up
and
bow
kneel
pray
the
rosary
and
the
psalter
and
all
this
not
before
an
idol
but
before
the
holy
cross
of
god
or
the
pictures
of
his
saints
this
we
call
honoring
and
worshiping
god
and
according
to
the
first
commandment
having
no
other
gods
although
these
things
usurers
adulterers
and
all
manner
of
sinners
can
do
too
and
do
them
daily
of
course
if
these
things
are
done
with
such
faith
that
we
believe
that
they
please
god
then
they
are
praiseworthy
not
because
of
their
virtue
but
because
of
such
faith
for
which
all
works
are
of
equal
value
as
has
been
said
but
if
we
doubt
or
do
not
believe
that
god
is
gracious
to
us
and
is
pleased
with
us
or
if
we
presumptuously
expect
to
please
him
only
through
and
after
our
works
then
it
is
all
pure
deception
outwardly
honoring
god
but
inwardly
setting
up
self
as
a
false
god
this
is
the
reason
why
i
have
so
often
spoken
against
the
display
magnificence
and
multitude
of
such
works
and
have
rejected
them
because
it
is
as
clear
as
day
that
they
are
not
only
done
in
doubt
or
without
faith
but
there
is
not
one
in
a
thousand
who
does
not
set
his
confidence
upon
the
works
expecting
by
them
to
win
god
favor
and
anticipate
his
grace
and
so
they
make
a
fair
of
them
a
thing
which
god
can
not
endure
since
he
has
promised
his
grace
freely
and
wills
that
we
begin
by
trusting
that
grace
and
in
it
perform
all
works
whatever
they
may
be
xii
note
for
yourself
then
how
far
apart
these
two
are
keeping
the
first
commandment
with
outward
works
only
and
keeping
it
with
inward
trust
for
this
last
makes
true
living
children
of
god
the
other
only
makes
worse
idolatry
and
the
most
mischievous
hypocrites
on
earth
who
with
their
apparent
righteousness
lead
unnumbered
people
into
their
way
and
yet
allow
them
to
be
without
faith
so
that
they
are
miserably
misled
and
are
caught
in
the
pitiable
babbling
and
mummery
of
such
christ
says
matthew
xxiv
beware
if
any
man
shall
say
unto
you
lo
here
is
christ
or
there
and
john
iv
i
say
unto
thee
the
hour
cometh
when
ye
shall
neither
in
this
mountain
nor
yet
at
jerusalem
worship
god
for
the
father
seeketh
spiritual
worshipers
these
and
similar
passages
have
moved
me
and
ought
to
move
everyone
to
reject
the
great
display
of
bulls
seals
flags
indulgences
by
which
the
poor
folk
are
led
to
build
churches
to
give
to
endow
to
pray
and
yet
faith
is
not
mentioned
and
is
even
suppressed
for
since
faith
knows
no
distinction
among
works
such
exaltation
and
urging
of
one
work
above
another
can
not
exist
beside
faith
for
faith
desires
to
be
the
only
service
of
god
and
will
grant
this
name
and
honor
to
no
other
work
except
in
so
far
as
faith
imparts
it
as
it
does
when
the
work
is
done
in
faith
and
by
faith
this
perversion
is
indicated
in
the
old
testament
when
the
jews
left
the
temple
and
sacrificed
at
other
places
in
the
green
parks
and
on
the
mountains
this
is
what
these
men
also
do
they
are
zealous
to
do
all
works
but
this
chief
work
of
faith
they
regard
not
at
all
xiii
where
now
are
they
who
ask
what
works
are
good
what
they
shall
do
how
they
shall
be
religious
yes
and
where
are
they
who
say
that
when
we
preach
of
faith
we
shall
neither
teach
nor
do
works
does
not
this
first
commandment
give
us
more
work
to
do
than
any
man
can
do
if
a
man
were
a
thousand
men
or
all
men
or
all
creatures
this
commandment
would
yet
ask
enough
of
him
and
more
than
enough
since
he
is
commanded
to
live
and
walk
at
all
times
in
faith
and
confidence
toward
god
to
place
such
faith
in
no
one
else
and
so
to
have
only
one
the
true
god
and
none
other
now
since
the
being
and
nature
of
man
can
not
for
an
instant
be
without
doing
or
not
doing
something
enduring
or
running
away
from
something
for
as
we
see
life
never
rests
let
him
who
will
be
pious
and
filled
with
good
works
begin
and
in
all
his
life
and
works
at
all
times
exercise
himself
in
this
faith
let
him
learn
to
do
and
to
leave
undone
all
things
in
such
continual
faith
then
will
he
find
how
much
work
he
has
to
do
and
how
completely
all
things
are
included
in
faith
how
he
dare
never
grow
idle
because
his
very
idling
must
be
the
exercise
and
work
of
faith
in
brief
nothing
can
be
in
or
about
us
and
nothing
can
happen
to
us
but
that
it
must
be
good
and
meritorious
if
we
believe
as
we
ought
that
all
things
please
god
so
says
paul
dear
brethren
all
that
ye
do
whether
ye
eat
or
drink
do
all
in
the
name
of
jesus
christ
our
lord
now
it
can
not
be
done
in
this
name
except
it
be
done
in
this
faith
likewise
romans
vii
we
know
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
to
the
saints
of
god
therefore
when
some
say
that
good
works
are
forbidden
when
we
preach
faith
alone
it
is
as
if
i
said
to
a
sick
man
if
you
had
health
you
would
have
the
use
of
all
your
limbs
but
without
health
the
works
of
all
your
limbs
are
nothing
and
he
wanted
to
infer
that
i
had
forbidden
the
works
of
all
his
limbs
whereas
on
the
contrary
i
meant
that
he
must
first
have
health
which
will
work
all
the
works
of
all
the
members
so
faith
also
must
be
in
all
works
the
and
captain
or
they
are
nothing
at
all
xiv
you
might
say
why
then
do
we
have
so
many
laws
of
the
church
and
of
the
state
and
many
ceremonies
of
churches
monastic
houses
holy
places
which
urge
and
tempt
men
to
good
works
if
faith
does
all
things
through
the
first
commandment
i
answer
simply
because
we
do
not
all
have
faith
or
do
not
heed
it
if
every
man
had
faith
we
would
need
no
more
laws
but
every
one
would
of
himself
at
all
times
do
good
works
as
his
confidence
in
god
teaches
him
but
now
there
are
four
kinds
of
men
the
first
just
mentioned
who
need
no
law
of
whom
paul
says
timothy
i
the
law
is
not
made
for
a
righteous
man
that
is
for
the
believer
but
believers
of
themselves
do
what
they
know
and
can
do
only
because
they
firmly
trust
that
god
favor
and
grace
rests
upon
them
in
all
things
the
second
class
want
to
abuse
this
freedom
put
a
false
confidence
in
it
and
grow
lazy
of
whom
peter
says
peter
ii
ye
shall
live
as
free
men
but
not
using
your
liberty
for
a
cloak
of
maliciousness
as
if
he
said
the
freedom
of
faith
does
not
permit
sins
nor
will
it
cover
them
but
it
sets
us
free
to
do
all
manner
of
good
works
and
to
endure
all
things
as
they
happen
to
us
so
that
a
man
is
not
bound
only
to
one
work
or
to
a
few
so
also
paul
galatians
v
use
not
your
liberty
for
an
occasion
to
the
flesh
such
men
must
be
urged
by
laws
and
hemmed
in
by
teaching
and
exhortation
the
third
class
are
wicked
men
always
ready
for
sins
these
must
be
constrained
by
spiritual
and
temporal
laws
like
wild
horses
and
dogs
and
where
this
does
not
help
they
must
be
put
to
death
by
the
worldly
sword
as
paul
says
romans
xiii
the
worldly
ruler
bears
the
sword
and
serves
god
with
it
not
as
a
terror
to
the
good
but
to
the
evil
the
fourth
class
who
are
still
lusty
and
childish
in
their
understanding
of
faith
and
of
the
spiritual
life
must
be
coaxed
like
young
children
and
tempted
with
external
definite
and
prescribed
decorations
with
reading
praying
fasting
singing
adorning
of
churches
organ
playing
and
such
other
things
as
are
commanded
and
observed
in
monastic
houses
and
churches
until
they
also
learn
to
know
the
faith
although
there
is
great
danger
here
when
the
rulers
as
is
now
alas
the
case
busy
themselves
with
and
insist
upon
such
ceremonies
and
external
works
as
if
they
were
the
true
works
and
neglect
faith
which
they
ought
always
to
teach
along
with
these
works
just
as
a
mother
gives
her
child
other
food
along
with
the
milk
until
the
child
can
eat
the
strong
food
by
itself
xv
since
then
we
are
not
all
alike
we
must
tolerate
such
people
share
their
observances
and
burdens
and
not
despise
them
but
teach
them
the
true
way
of
faith
so
paul
teaches
romans
xiv
him
that
is
weak
in
the
faith
receive
ye
to
teach
him
and
so
he
did
himself
corinthians
ix
to
them
that
are
under
the
law
i
became
as
under
the
law
although
i
was
not
under
the
law
and
christ
matthew
xvii
when
he
was
asked
to
pay
tribute
which
he
was
not
obligated
to
pay
argues
with
peter
whether
the
children
of
kings
must
give
tribute
or
only
other
people
peter
answers
only
other
people
christ
said
then
are
the
children
of
kings
free
notwithstanding
lest
we
should
offend
them
go
thou
to
the
sea
and
cast
an
hook
and
take
up
the
fish
that
first
cometh
up
and
in
his
mouth
thou
shalt
find
a
piece
of
money
take
that
and
give
it
for
me
and
thee
here
we
see
that
all
works
and
things
are
free
to
a
christian
through
his
faith
and
yet
because
the
others
do
not
yet
believe
he
observes
and
bears
with
them
what
he
is
not
obligated
to
do
but
this
he
does
freely
for
he
is
certain
that
this
is
pleasing
to
god
and
he
does
it
willingly
accepts
it
as
any
other
free
work
which
comes
to
his
hand
without
his
choice
because
he
desires
and
seeks
no
more
than
that
he
may
in
his
faith
do
works
to
please
god
but
since
in
this
discourse
we
have
undertaken
to
teach
what
righteous
and
good
works
are
and
are
now
speaking
of
the
highest
work
it
is
clear
that
we
do
not
speak
of
the
second
third
and
fourth
classes
of
men
but
of
the
first
into
whose
likeness
all
the
others
are
to
grow
and
until
they
do
so
the
first
class
must
endure
and
instruct
them
therefore
we
must
not
despise
as
if
they
were
hopeless
these
men
of
weak
faith
who
would
gladly
do
right
and
learn
and
yet
can
not
understand
because
of
the
ceremonies
to
which
they
cling
we
must
rather
blame
their
ignorant
blind
teachers
who
have
never
taught
them
the
faith
and
have
led
them
so
deeply
into
works
they
must
be
gently
and
gradually
led
back
again
to
faith
as
a
sick
man
is
treated
and
must
be
allowed
for
a
time
for
their
conscience
sake
to
cling
to
some
works
and
do
them
as
necessary
to
salvation
so
long
as
they
rightly
grasp
the
faith
lest
if
we
try
to
tear
them
out
so
suddenly
their
weak
consciences
be
quite
shattered
and
confused
and
retain
neither
faith
nor
works
but
the
hardheaded
who
hardened
in
their
works
give
no
heed
to
what
is
said
of
faith
and
fight
against
it
these
we
must
as
christ
did
and
taught
let
go
their
way
that
the
blind
may
lead
the
blind
xvi
but
you
say
how
can
i
trust
surely
that
all
my
works
are
pleasing
to
god
when
at
times
i
fall
and
talk
eat
drink
and
sleep
too
much
or
otherwise
transgress
as
i
can
not
help
doing
answer
this
question
shows
that
you
still
regard
faith
as
a
work
among
other
works
and
do
not
set
it
above
all
works
for
it
is
the
highest
work
for
this
very
reason
because
it
remains
and
blots
out
these
daily
sins
by
not
doubting
that
god
is
so
kind
to
you
as
to
wink
at
such
daily
transgression
and
weakness
aye
even
if
a
deadly
sin
should
occur
which
however
never
or
rarely
happens
to
those
who
live
in
faith
and
trust
toward
god
yet
faith
rises
again
and
does
not
doubt
that
its
sin
is
already
gone
as
it
is
written
john
ii
my
little
children
these
things
i
write
unto
you
that
ye
sin
not
and
if
any
man
sin
we
have
an
advocate
with
god
the
father
jesus
christ
who
is
the
propitiation
of
all
our
sins
and
wisdom
xv
for
if
we
sin
we
are
thine
knowing
thy
power
and
proverbs
xxiv
for
a
just
man
falleth
seven
times
and
riseth
up
again
yes
this
confidence
and
faith
must
be
so
high
and
strong
that
the
man
knows
that
all
his
life
and
works
are
nothing
but
damnable
sins
before
god
judgment
as
it
is
written
psalm
cxliii
in
thy
sight
shall
no
man
living
be
justified
and
he
must
entirely
despair
of
his
works
believing
that
they
can
not
be
good
except
through
this
faith
which
looks
for
no
judgment
but
only
for
pure
grace
favor
kindness
and
mercy
like
david
psalm
xxvi
thy
loving
kindness
is
ever
before
mine
eyes
and
i
have
trusted
in
thy
truth
psalm
iv
the
light
of
thy
countenance
is
lift
up
upon
us
that
is
the
knowledge
of
thy
grace
through
faith
and
thereby
hast
thou
put
gladness
in
my
heart
for
as
faith
trusts
so
it
receives
see
thus
are
works
forgiven
are
without
guilt
and
are
good
not
by
their
own
nature
but
by
the
mercy
and
grace
of
god
because
of
the
faith
which
trusts
on
the
mercy
of
god
therefore
we
must
fear
because
of
the
works
but
comfort
ourselves
because
of
the
grace
of
god
as
it
is
written
psalm
cxlvii
the
lord
taketh
pleasure
in
them
that
i
fear
him
in
those
that
hope
in
his
mercy
so
we
pray
with
perfect
confidence
our
father
and
yet
petition
forgive
us
our
trespasses
we
are
children
and
yet
sinners
are
acceptable
and
yet
do
not
do
enough
and
all
this
is
the
work
of
faith
firmly
grounded
in
god
grace
xvii
but
if
you
ask
where
the
faith
and
the
confidence
can
be
found
and
whence
they
come
this
it
is
certainly
most
necessary
to
know
first
without
doubt
faith
does
not
come
from
your
works
or
merit
but
alone
from
jesus
christ
and
is
freely
promised
and
given
as
paul
writes
romans
v
god
commendeth
his
love
to
us
as
exceeding
sweet
and
kindly
in
that
while
we
were
yet
sinners
christ
died
for
us
as
if
he
said
ought
not
this
give
us
a
strong
unconquerable
confidence
that
before
we
prayed
or
cared
for
it
yes
while
we
still
continually
walked
in
sins
christ
dies
for
our
sin
paul
concludes
if
while
we
were
yet
sinners
christ
died
for
us
how
much
more
then
being
justified
by
his
blood
shall
we
be
saved
from
wrath
through
him
and
if
when
we
were
enemies
we
were
reconciled
to
god
by
the
death
of
his
son
much
more
being
reconciled
shall
we
be
saved
by
his
life
lo
thus
must
thou
form
christ
within
thyself
and
see
how
in
him
god
holds
before
thee
and
offers
thee
his
mercy
without
any
previous
merits
of
thine
own
and
from
such
a
view
of
his
grace
must
thou
draw
faith
and
confidence
of
the
forgiveness
of
all
thy
sins
faith
therefore
does
not
begin
with
works
neither
do
they
create
it
but
it
must
spring
up
and
flow
from
the
blood
wounds
and
death
of
christ
if
thou
see
in
these
that
god
is
so
kindly
affectioned
toward
thee
that
he
gives
even
his
son
for
thee
then
thy
heart
also
must
in
its
turn
grow
sweet
and
kindly
affectioned
toward
god
and
so
thy
confidence
must
grow
out
of
pure
and
love
god
love
toward
thee
and
thine
toward
god
we
never
read
that
the
holy
spirit
was
given
to
any
one
when
he
did
works
but
always
when
men
have
heard
the
gospel
of
christ
and
the
mercy
of
god
from
this
same
word
and
from
no
other
source
must
faith
still
come
even
in
our
day
and
always
for
christ
is
the
rock
out
of
which
men
suck
oil
and
honey
as
moses
says
deuteronomy
xxxii
xviii
so
far
we
have
treated
of
the
first
work
and
of
the
first
commandment
but
very
briefly
plainly
and
hastily
for
very
much
might
be
said
of
it
we
will
now
trace
the
works
farther
through
the
following
commandments
the
second
work
next
to
faith
is
the
work
of
the
second
commandment
that
we
shall
honor
god
name
and
not
take
it
in
vain
this
like
all
the
other
works
can
not
be
done
without
faith
and
if
it
is
done
without
faith
it
is
all
sham
and
show
after
faith
we
can
do
no
greater
work
than
to
praise
preach
sing
and
in
every
way
exalt
and
magnify
god
glory
honor
and
name
and
although
i
have
said
above
and
it
is
true
that
there
is
no
difference
in
works
where
faith
is
and
does
the
work
yet
this
is
true
only
when
they
are
compared
with
faith
and
its
works
measured
by
one
another
there
is
a
difference
and
one
is
higher
than
the
other
just
as
in
the
body
the
members
do
not
differ
when
compared
with
health
and
health
works
in
the
one
as
much
as
in
the
other
yet
the
works
of
the
members
are
different
and
one
is
higher
nobler
more
useful
than
the
other
so
here
also
to
praise
god
glory
and
name
is
better
than
the
works
of
the
other
commandments
which
follow
and
yet
it
must
be
done
in
the
same
faith
as
all
the
others
but
i
know
well
that
this
work
is
lightly
esteemed
and
has
indeed
become
unknown
therefore
we
must
examine
it
further
and
will
say
no
more
about
the
necessity
of
doing
it
in
the
faith
and
confidence
that
it
pleases
god
indeed
there
is
no
work
in
which
confidence
and
faith
are
so
much
experienced
and
felt
as
in
honoring
god
name
and
it
greatly
helps
to
strengthen
and
increase
faith
although
all
works
also
help
to
do
this
as
peter
says
ii
peter
i
wherefore
the
rather
brethren
give
diligence
through
good
works
to
make
your
calling
and
election
sure
xix
the
first
commandment
forbids
us
to
have
other
gods
and
thereby
commands
that
we
have
a
god
the
true
god
by
a
firm
faith
trust
confidence
hope
and
love
which
are
the
only
works
whereby
a
man
can
have
honor
and
keep
a
god
for
by
no
other
work
can
one
find
or
lose
god
except
by
faith
or
unbelief
by
trusting
or
doubting
of
the
other
works
none
reaches
quite
to
god
so
also
in
the
second
commandment
we
are
forbidden
to
use
his
name
in
vain
yet
this
is
not
to
be
enough
but
we
are
thereby
also
commanded
to
honor
call
upon
glorify
preach
and
praise
his
name
and
indeed
it
is
impossible
that
god
name
should
not
be
dishonored
where
it
is
not
rightly
honored
for
although
it
be
honored
with
the
lips
bending
of
the
knees
kissing
and
other
postures
if
this
is
not
done
in
the
heart
by
faith
in
confident
trust
in
god
grace
it
is
nothing
else
than
an
evidence
and
badge
of
hypocrisy
see
now
how
many
kinds
of
good
works
a
man
can
do
under
this
commandment
at
all
times
and
never
be
without
the
good
works
of
this
commandment
if
he
will
so
that
he
truly
need
not
make
a
long
pilgrimage
or
seek
holy
places
for
tell
me
what
moment
can
pass
in
which
we
do
not
without
ceasing
receive
god
blessings
or
on
the
other
hand
suffer
adversity
but
what
else
are
god
blessings
and
adversities
than
a
constant
urging
and
stirring
up
to
praise
honor
and
bless
god
and
to
call
upon
his
name
now
if
you
had
nothing
else
at
all
to
do
would
you
not
have
enough
to
do
with
this
commandment
alone
that
you
without
ceasing
bless
sing
praise
and
honor
name
and
for
what
other
purpose
have
tongue
voice
language
and
mouth
been
created
as
psalm
li
says
lord
open
thou
my
lips
and
my
mouth
shall
show
forth
thy
praise
again
my
tongue
shall
sing
aloud
of
thy
mercy
what
work
is
there
in
heaven
except
that
of
this
second
commandment
as
it
is
written
in
psalm
lxxxiv
blessed
are
they
that
dwell
in
thy
house
they
will
be
for
ever
praising
thee
so
also
david
says
in
psalm
xxxiv
god
praise
shall
be
continually
in
my
mouth
and
paul
corinthians
x
whether
therefore
ye
eat
or
drink
or
whatsoever
ye
do
do
all
to
the
glory
of
god
also
colossians
iii
whatsoever
ye
do
in
word
or
deed
do
all
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
giving
thanks
to
god
and
the
father
if
we
were
to
observe
this
work
we
would
have
a
heaven
here
on
earth
and
always
have
enough
to
do
as
have
the
saints
in
heaven
xx
on
this
is
based
the
wonderful
and
righteous
judgment
of
god
that
at
times
a
poor
man
in
whom
no
one
can
see
many
great
works
in
the
privacy
of
his
home
joyfully
praises
god
when
he
fares
well
or
with
entire
confidence
calls
upon
him
when
he
fares
ill
and
thereby
does
a
greater
and
more
acceptable
work
than
another
who
fasts
much
prays
much
endows
churches
makes
pilgrimages
and
burdens
himself
with
great
deeds
in
this
place
and
in
that
such
a
fool
opens
wide
his
mouth
looks
for
great
works
to
do
and
is
so
blinded
that
he
does
not
at
all
notice
this
greatest
work
and
praising
god
is
in
his
eyes
a
very
small
matter
compared
with
the
great
idea
he
has
formed
of
the
works
of
his
own
devising
in
which
he
perhaps
praises
himself
more
than
god
or
takes
more
pleasure
in
them
than
he
does
in
god
and
thus
with
his
good
works
he
storms
against
the
second
commandment
and
its
works
of
all
this
we
have
an
illustration
in
the
case
of
the
pharisee
and
the
publican
in
the
gospel
for
the
sinner
calls
upon
god
in
his
sins
and
praises
him
and
so
has
hit
upon
the
two
highest
commandments
faith
and
god
honor
the
hypocrite
misses
both
and
struts
about
with
other
good
works
by
which
he
praises
himself
and
not
god
and
puts
his
trust
in
himself
more
than
in
god
therefore
he
is
justly
rejected
and
the
other
chosen
the
reason
of
all
this
is
that
the
higher
and
better
the
works
are
the
less
show
they
make
and
that
every
one
thinks
they
are
easy
because
it
is
evident
that
no
one
pretends
to
praise
god
name
and
honor
so
much
as
the
very
men
who
never
do
it
and
with
their
show
of
doing
it
while
the
heart
is
without
faith
cause
the
precious
work
to
be
despised
so
that
the
apostle
paul
dare
say
boldly
romans
ii
that
they
blaspheme
god
name
who
make
their
boast
of
god
law
for
to
name
the
name
of
god
and
to
write
his
honor
on
paper
and
on
the
walls
is
an
easy
matter
but
genuinely
to
praise
and
bless
him
in
his
good
deeds
and
confidently
to
call
upon
him
in
all
adversities
these
are
truly
the
most
rare
highest
works
next
to
faith
so
that
if
we
were
to
see
how
few
of
them
there
are
in
christendom
we
might
despair
for
very
sorrow
and
yet
there
is
a
constant
increase
of
high
pretty
shining
works
of
men
devising
or
of
works
which
look
like
these
true
works
but
at
bottom
are
all
without
faith
and
without
faithfulness
in
short
there
is
nothing
good
back
of
them
thus
also
isaiah
xlviii
rebukes
the
people
of
israel
hear
ye
this
ye
which
are
called
by
the
name
of
israel
which
swear
by
the
name
of
the
lord
and
make
mention
of
the
god
of
israel
neither
in
truth
nor
in
righteousness
that
is
they
did
it
not
in
the
true
faith
and
confidence
which
is
the
real
truth
and
righteousness
but
trusted
in
themselves
their
works
and
powers
and
yet
called
upon
god
name
and
praised
him
two
things
which
do
not
fit
together
xxi
the
first
work
of
this
commandment
then
is
to
praise
god
in
all
his
benefits
which
are
innumerable
so
that
such
praise
and
thanksgiving
ought
also
of
right
never
to
cease
or
end
for
who
can
praise
him
perfectly
for
the
gift
of
natural
life
not
to
mention
all
other
temporal
and
eternal
blessings
and
so
through
this
one
part
of
the
commandment
man
is
overwhelmed
with
good
and
precious
works
if
he
do
these
in
true
faith
he
has
indeed
not
lived
in
vain
and
in
this
matter
none
sin
so
much
as
the
most
resplendent
saints
who
are
pleased
with
themselves
and
like
to
praise
themselves
or
to
hear
themselves
praised
honored
and
glorified
before
men
therefore
the
second
work
of
this
commandment
is
to
be
on
one
guard
to
flee
from
and
to
avoid
all
temporal
honor
and
praise
and
never
to
seek
a
name
for
oneself
or
fame
and
a
great
reputation
that
every
one
sing
of
him
and
tell
of
him
which
is
an
exceedingly
dangerous
sin
and
yet
the
most
common
of
all
and
alas
little
regarded
every
one
wants
to
be
of
importance
and
not
to
be
the
least
however
small
he
may
be
so
deeply
is
nature
sunk
in
the
evil
of
its
own
conceit
and
in
its
contrary
to
these
two
first
commandments
now
the
world
regards
this
terrible
vice
as
the
highest
virtue
and
this
makes
it
exceedingly
dangerous
for
those
who
do
not
understand
and
have
not
had
experience
of
god
commandments
and
the
histories
of
the
holy
scriptures
to
read
or
hear
the
heathen
books
and
histories
for
all
heathen
books
are
poisoned
through
and
through
with
this
striving
after
praise
and
honor
in
them
men
are
taught
by
blind
reason
that
they
were
not
nor
could
be
men
of
power
and
worth
who
are
not
moved
by
praise
and
honor
but
those
are
counted
the
best
who
disregard
body
and
life
friend
and
property
and
everything
in
the
effort
to
win
praise
and
honor
all
the
holy
fathers
have
complained
of
this
vice
and
with
one
mind
conclude
that
it
is
the
very
last
vice
to
be
overcome
augustine
says
all
other
vices
are
practised
in
evil
works
only
honor
and
are
practised
in
and
by
means
of
good
works
therefore
if
a
man
had
nothing
else
to
do
except
this
second
work
of
this
commandment
he
would
yet
have
to
work
all
his
in
order
to
fight
this
vice
and
drive
it
out
so
common
so
subtile
so
quick
and
insidious
is
it
now
we
all
pass
by
this
good
work
and
exercise
ourselves
in
many
other
lesser
good
works
nay
through
other
good
works
we
overthrow
this
and
forget
it
entirely
so
the
holy
name
of
god
which
alone
should
be
honored
is
taken
in
vain
and
dishonored
through
our
own
cursed
name
and
and
this
sin
is
more
grievous
before
god
than
murder
and
adultery
but
its
wickedness
is
not
so
clearly
seen
as
that
of
murder
because
of
its
subtilty
for
it
is
not
accomplished
in
the
coarse
flesh
but
in
the
spirit
xxii
some
think
it
is
good
for
young
people
that
they
be
enticed
by
reputation
and
honor
and
again
by
shame
of
and
dishonor
and
so
be
induced
to
do
good
for
there
are
many
who
do
the
good
and
leave
the
evil
undone
out
of
fear
of
shame
and
love
of
honor
and
so
do
what
they
would
otherwise
by
no
means
do
or
leave
undone
these
i
leave
to
their
opinion
but
at
present
we
are
seeking
how
true
good
works
are
to
be
done
and
they
who
are
inclined
to
do
them
surely
do
not
need
to
be
driven
by
the
fear
of
shame
and
the
love
of
honor
they
have
and
are
to
have
a
higher
and
far
nobler
incentive
namely
god
commandment
god
fear
god
approval
and
their
faith
and
love
toward
god
they
who
have
not
or
regard
not
this
motive
and
let
shame
and
honor
drive
them
these
also
have
their
reward
as
the
lord
says
matthew
vi
and
as
the
motive
so
is
also
the
work
and
the
reward
none
of
them
is
good
except
only
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
now
i
hold
that
a
young
person
could
be
more
easily
trained
and
incited
by
god
fear
and
commandments
than
by
any
other
means
yet
where
these
do
not
help
we
must
endure
that
they
do
the
good
and
leave
the
evil
for
the
sake
of
shame
and
of
honor
just
as
we
must
also
endure
wicked
men
or
the
imperfect
of
whom
we
spoke
above
nor
can
we
do
more
than
tell
them
that
their
works
are
not
satisfactory
and
right
before
god
and
so
leave
them
until
they
learn
to
do
right
for
the
sake
of
god
commandments
also
just
as
young
children
are
induced
to
pray
fast
learn
by
gifts
and
promises
of
the
parents
even
though
it
would
not
be
good
to
treat
them
so
all
their
lives
so
that
they
never
learn
to
do
good
in
the
fear
of
god
far
worse
if
they
become
accustomed
to
do
good
for
the
sake
of
praise
and
honor
xxiii
but
this
is
true
that
we
must
none
the
less
have
a
good
name
and
honor
and
every
one
ought
so
to
live
that
nothing
evil
can
be
said
of
him
and
that
he
give
offence
to
no
one
as
paul
says
romans
xii
we
are
to
be
zealous
to
do
good
not
only
before
god
but
also
before
all
men
and
ii
corinthians
iv
we
walk
so
honestly
that
no
man
knows
anything
against
us
but
there
must
be
great
diligence
and
care
lest
such
honor
and
good
name
puff
up
the
heart
and
the
heart
find
pleasure
in
them
here
the
saying
of
solomon
holds
as
the
fire
in
the
furnace
proveth
the
gold
so
man
is
proved
by
the
mouth
of
him
that
praises
him
few
and
most
spiritual
men
must
they
be
who
when
honored
and
praised
remain
indifferent
and
unchanged
so
that
they
do
not
care
for
it
nor
feel
pride
and
pleasure
in
it
but
remain
entirely
free
ascribe
all
their
honor
and
fame
to
god
offering
it
to
him
alone
and
using
it
only
to
the
glory
of
god
to
the
edification
of
their
neighbors
and
in
no
way
to
their
own
benefit
or
advantage
so
that
a
man
trust
not
in
his
own
honor
nor
exalt
himself
above
the
most
incapable
despised
man
on
earth
but
acknowledge
himself
a
servant
of
god
who
has
given
him
the
honor
in
order
that
with
it
he
may
serve
god
and
his
neighbor
just
as
if
he
had
commanded
him
to
distribute
some
gulden
to
the
poor
for
his
sake
so
he
says
matthew
v
your
light
shall
shine
before
men
so
that
they
may
see
your
good
works
and
glorify
your
father
who
is
in
heaven
he
does
not
say
they
shall
praise
you
but
your
works
shall
only
serve
them
to
edification
that
through
them
they
may
praise
god
in
you
and
in
themselves
this
is
the
correct
use
of
god
name
and
honor
when
god
is
thereby
praised
through
the
edification
of
others
and
if
men
want
to
praise
us
and
not
god
in
us
we
are
not
to
endure
it
but
with
all
our
powers
forbid
it
and
flee
from
it
as
from
the
most
grievous
sin
and
robbery
of
divine
honor
xxiv
hence
it
comes
that
god
frequently
permits
a
man
to
fall
into
or
remain
in
grievous
sin
in
order
that
he
may
be
put
to
shame
in
his
own
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
men
who
otherwise
could
not
have
kept
himself
from
this
great
vice
of
vain
honor
and
fame
if
he
had
remained
constant
in
his
great
gifts
and
virtues
so
god
must
ward
off
this
sin
by
means
of
other
grievous
sins
that
his
name
alone
may
be
honored
and
thus
one
sin
becomes
the
other
medicine
because
of
our
perverse
wickedness
which
not
only
does
the
evil
but
also
misuses
all
that
is
good
now
see
how
much
a
man
has
to
do
if
he
would
do
good
works
which
always
are
at
hand
in
great
number
and
with
which
he
is
surrounded
on
all
sides
but
alas
because
of
his
blindness
he
passes
them
by
and
seeks
and
runs
after
others
of
his
own
devising
and
pleasure
against
which
no
man
can
sufficiently
speak
and
no
man
can
sufficiently
guard
with
this
all
the
prophets
had
to
contend
and
for
this
reason
they
were
all
slain
only
because
they
rejected
such
works
and
preached
only
god
commandments
as
one
of
them
says
jeremiah
vii
thus
saith
the
god
of
israel
unto
you
take
your
burnt
offerings
unto
all
your
sacrifices
and
eat
your
and
your
flesh
yourselves
for
concerning
these
things
i
have
commanded
you
nothing
but
this
thing
commanded
i
you
obey
my
voice
that
is
not
what
seems
right
and
good
to
you
but
what
i
bid
you
and
walk
in
the
way
that
i
have
commanded
you
and
deuteronomy
xii
thou
shalt
not
do
whatsoever
is
right
in
thine
own
eyes
but
what
thy
god
has
commanded
thee
these
and
numberless
like
passages
of
scripture
are
spoken
to
tear
man
not
only
from
sins
but
also
from
the
works
which
seem
to
men
to
be
good
and
right
and
to
turn
men
with
a
single
mind
to
the
simple
meaning
of
god
commandment
only
that
they
shall
diligently
observe
this
only
and
always
as
it
is
written
exodus
xiii
these
commandments
shall
be
for
a
sign
unto
thee
upon
thine
hand
and
for
a
memorial
between
thine
eyes
and
psalm
i
a
godly
man
meditates
in
god
law
day
and
night
for
we
have
more
than
enough
and
too
much
to
do
if
we
are
to
satisfy
only
god
commandments
he
has
given
us
such
commandments
that
if
we
understand
them
aright
we
dare
not
for
a
moment
be
idle
and
might
easily
forget
all
other
works
but
the
evil
spirit
who
never
rests
when
he
can
not
lead
us
to
the
left
into
evil
works
fights
on
our
right
through
works
that
seem
good
but
against
which
god
has
commanded
deuteronomy
xxviii
and
joshua
xxiii
ye
shall
not
go
aside
from
my
commandments
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
xxv
the
third
work
of
this
commandment
is
to
call
upon
god
name
in
every
need
for
this
god
regards
as
keeping
his
name
holy
and
greatly
honoring
it
if
we
name
and
call
upon
it
in
adversity
and
need
and
this
is
really
why
he
sends
us
so
much
trouble
suffering
adversity
and
even
death
and
lets
us
live
in
many
wicked
sinful
affections
that
he
may
thereby
urge
man
and
give
him
much
reason
to
run
to
him
to
cry
aloud
to
him
to
call
upon
his
holy
name
and
thus
to
fulfil
this
work
of
the
second
commandment
as
he
says
in
psalm
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
for
i
desire
the
sacrifice
of
praise
and
this
is
the
way
whereby
thou
canst
come
unto
salvation
for
through
such
works
man
perceives
and
learns
what
god
name
is
how
powerful
it
is
to
help
all
who
call
upon
it
and
whereby
confidence
and
faith
grow
mightily
and
these
are
the
fulfilling
of
the
first
and
highest
commandment
this
is
the
experience
of
david
psalm
liv
thou
hast
delivered
me
out
of
all
trouble
therefore
will
i
praise
thy
name
and
confess
that
it
is
lovely
and
sweet
and
psalm
xci
says
because
he
hath
set
his
hope
upon
me
therefore
will
i
deliver
him
i
will
help
him
because
he
hath
known
my
name
lo
what
man
is
there
on
earth
who
would
not
all
his
life
long
have
enough
to
do
with
this
work
for
who
lives
an
hour
without
trials
i
will
not
mention
the
trials
of
adversity
which
are
innumerable
for
this
is
the
most
dangerous
trial
of
all
when
there
is
no
trial
and
every
thing
is
and
goes
well
for
then
a
man
is
tempted
to
forget
god
to
become
too
bold
and
to
misuse
the
times
of
prosperity
yea
here
he
has
ten
times
more
need
to
call
upon
god
name
than
when
in
adversity
since
it
is
written
psalm
xci
a
thousand
shall
fall
on
the
left
hand
and
ten
thousand
on
the
right
hand
so
too
we
see
in
broad
day
in
all
men
daily
experience
that
more
heinous
sins
and
vice
occur
when
there
is
peace
when
all
things
are
cheap
and
there
are
good
times
than
when
war
pestilence
sicknesses
and
all
manner
of
misfortune
burden
us
so
that
moses
also
fears
for
his
people
lest
they
forsake
god
commandment
for
no
other
reason
than
because
they
are
too
full
too
well
provided
for
and
have
too
much
peace
as
he
says
deuteronomy
xxxii
my
people
is
waxed
rich
full
and
fat
therefore
has
it
forsaken
its
god
wherefore
also
god
let
many
of
its
enemies
remain
and
would
not
drive
them
out
in
order
that
they
should
not
have
peace
and
must
exercise
themselves
in
the
keeping
of
god
commandments
as
it
is
written
judges
iii
so
he
deals
with
us
also
when
he
sends
us
all
kinds
of
misfortune
so
exceedingly
careful
is
he
of
us
that
he
may
teach
us
and
drive
us
to
honor
and
call
upon
his
name
to
gain
confidence
and
faith
toward
him
and
so
to
fulfil
the
first
two
commandments
xxvi
here
foolish
men
run
into
danger
and
especially
the
saints
and
those
who
want
to
be
more
than
others
they
teach
men
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
one
arms
himself
with
letters
another
runs
to
the
fortunetellers
one
seeks
this
another
that
if
only
they
may
thereby
escape
misfortune
and
be
secure
it
is
beyond
telling
what
a
devilish
allurement
attaches
to
this
trifling
with
sorcery
conjuring
and
superstition
all
of
which
is
done
only
that
men
may
not
need
god
name
and
put
no
trust
in
it
here
great
dishonor
is
done
the
name
of
god
and
the
first
two
commandments
in
that
men
look
to
the
devil
men
or
creatures
for
that
which
should
be
sought
and
found
in
god
alone
through
naught
but
a
pure
faith
and
confidence
and
a
cheerful
meditation
of
and
calling
upon
his
holy
name
now
examine
this
closely
for
yourself
and
see
whether
this
is
not
a
gross
mad
perversion
the
devil
men
and
creatures
they
must
believe
and
trust
to
them
for
the
best
without
such
faith
and
confidence
nothing
holds
or
helps
how
shall
the
good
and
faithful
god
reward
us
for
not
believing
and
trusting
him
as
much
or
more
than
man
and
the
devil
although
he
not
only
promises
help
and
sure
assistance
but
also
commands
us
confidently
to
look
for
it
and
gives
and
urges
all
manner
of
reasons
why
we
should
place
such
faith
and
confidence
in
him
is
it
not
lamentable
and
pitiable
that
the
devil
or
man
who
commands
nothing
and
does
not
urge
but
only
promises
is
set
above
god
who
promises
urges
and
commands
and
that
more
is
thought
of
them
than
of
god
himself
we
ought
truly
to
be
ashamed
of
ourselves
and
learn
from
the
example
of
those
who
trust
the
devil
or
men
for
if
the
devil
who
is
a
wicked
lying
spirit
keeps
faith
with
all
those
who
ally
themselves
with
him
how
much
more
will
not
the
most
gracious
god
keep
faith
if
a
man
trusts
him
nay
is
it
not
rather
he
alone
who
will
keep
faith
a
rich
man
trusts
and
relies
upon
his
money
and
possessions
and
they
help
him
and
we
are
not
willing
to
trust
and
rely
upon
the
living
god
that
he
is
willing
and
able
to
help
us
we
say
gold
makes
bold
and
it
is
true
as
baruch
iii
says
gold
is
a
thing
wherein
men
trust
but
far
greater
is
the
courage
which
the
highest
eternal
good
gives
wherein
trust
not
men
but
only
children
xxvii
even
if
none
of
these
adversities
constrain
us
to
call
upon
god
name
and
to
trust
him
yet
were
sin
alone
more
than
sufficient
to
train
and
to
urge
us
on
in
this
work
for
sin
has
hemmed
us
in
with
three
strong
mighty
armies
the
first
is
our
own
flesh
the
second
the
world
the
third
the
evil
spirit
by
which
three
we
are
without
ceasing
oppressed
and
troubled
whereby
god
gives
us
occasion
to
do
good
works
without
ceasing
namely
to
fight
with
these
enemies
and
sins
the
flesh
seeks
pleasure
and
peace
the
world
seeks
riches
favor
power
and
honor
the
evil
spirit
seeks
pride
glory
that
a
man
be
well
thought
of
and
other
men
be
despised
and
these
three
are
all
so
powerful
that
each
one
of
them
is
alone
sufficient
to
fight
a
man
and
yet
there
is
no
way
we
can
overcome
them
except
only
by
calling
upon
the
holy
name
of
god
in
a
firm
faith
as
solomon
says
proverbs
xviii
the
name
of
the
lord
is
a
strong
tower
the
righteous
runneth
into
it
and
is
set
aloft
and
david
psalm
cxvi
i
will
drink
the
cup
of
salvation
and
call
upon
the
name
of
the
lord
again
psalm
xviii
i
will
call
upon
the
lord
with
praise
so
shall
i
be
saved
from
all
mine
enemies
these
works
and
the
power
of
god
name
have
become
unknown
to
us
because
we
are
not
accustomed
to
it
and
have
never
seriously
fought
with
sins
and
have
not
needed
his
name
because
we
are
trained
only
in
our
self
devised
works
which
we
were
able
to
do
with
our
own
powers
xxviii
further
works
of
this
commandment
are
that
we
shall
not
swear
curse
lie
deceive
and
conjure
with
the
holy
name
of
god
and
otherwise
misuse
it
which
are
very
simple
matters
and
well
known
to
every
one
being
the
sins
which
have
been
almost
exclusively
preached
and
proclaimed
under
this
commandment
these
also
include
that
we
shall
prevent
others
from
making
sinful
use
of
god
name
by
lying
swearing
deceiving
cursing
conjuring
and
otherwise
herein
again
much
occasion
is
given
for
doing
good
and
warding
off
evil
but
the
greatest
and
most
difficult
work
of
this
commandment
is
to
protect
the
holy
name
of
god
against
all
who
misuse
it
in
a
spiritual
manner
and
to
proclaim
it
to
all
men
for
it
is
not
enough
that
i
for
myself
and
in
myself
praise
and
call
upon
god
name
in
prosperity
and
adversity
i
must
step
forth
and
for
the
sake
of
god
honor
and
name
bring
upon
myself
the
enmity
of
all
men
as
christ
said
to
his
disciples
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name
sake
here
we
must
provoke
to
anger
father
mother
and
the
best
of
friends
here
we
must
strive
against
spiritual
and
temporal
powers
and
be
accused
of
disobedience
here
we
must
stir
up
against
us
the
rich
learned
holy
and
all
that
is
of
repute
in
the
world
and
although
this
is
especially
the
duty
of
those
who
are
commanded
to
preach
god
word
yet
every
christian
is
also
obligated
to
do
so
when
time
and
place
demand
for
we
must
for
the
holy
name
of
god
risk
and
give
up
all
that
we
have
and
can
do
and
show
by
our
deeds
that
we
love
god
and
his
name
his
honor
and
his
praise
above
all
things
and
trust
him
above
all
things
and
expect
good
from
him
thereby
confessing
that
we
regard
him
as
the
highest
good
for
the
sake
of
which
we
let
go
and
give
up
all
other
goods
xxix
here
we
must
first
of
all
resist
all
wrong
where
truth
or
righteousness
suffers
violence
or
need
and
dare
make
no
distinction
of
persons
as
some
do
who
fight
most
actively
and
busily
against
the
wrong
which
is
done
to
the
rich
the
powerful
and
their
own
friends
but
when
it
is
done
to
the
poor
or
the
despised
or
their
own
enemy
they
are
quiet
and
patient
these
see
the
name
and
the
honor
of
god
not
as
it
is
but
through
a
painted
glass
and
measure
truth
or
righteousness
according
to
the
persons
and
do
not
consider
their
deceiving
eye
which
looks
more
on
the
person
than
on
the
thing
these
are
hypocrites
within
and
have
only
the
appearance
of
defending
the
truth
for
they
well
know
that
there
is
no
danger
when
one
helps
the
rich
the
powerful
the
learned
and
one
own
friends
and
can
in
turn
enjoy
their
protection
and
be
honored
by
them
thus
it
is
very
easy
to
fight
against
the
wrong
which
is
done
to
popes
kings
princes
bishops
and
other
here
each
wants
to
be
the
most
pious
where
there
is
no
great
need
o
how
sly
is
here
the
deceitful
adam
with
his
demand
how
finely
does
he
cover
his
greed
of
profit
with
the
name
of
truth
and
righteousness
and
god
honor
but
when
something
happens
to
a
poor
and
insignificant
man
there
the
deceitful
eye
does
not
find
much
profit
but
can
not
help
seeing
the
disfavor
of
the
powerful
therefore
he
lets
the
poor
man
remain
unhelped
and
who
could
tell
the
extent
of
this
vice
in
christendom
god
says
in
the
lxxxii
psalm
how
long
will
ye
judge
unjustly
and
accept
the
persons
of
the
wicked
judge
the
matter
of
the
poor
and
fatherless
demand
justice
for
the
poor
and
needy
deliver
the
poor
and
rid
the
forsaken
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked
but
it
is
not
done
and
therefore
the
text
continues
they
know
not
neither
will
they
understand
they
walk
on
in
darkness
that
is
the
truth
they
do
not
see
but
they
stop
at
the
reputation
of
the
great
however
unrighteous
they
are
and
do
not
consider
the
poor
however
righteous
they
are
xxx
see
here
would
be
many
good
works
for
the
greater
portion
of
the
powerful
rich
and
friends
do
injustice
and
oppress
the
poor
the
lowly
and
their
own
opponents
and
the
greater
the
men
the
worse
the
deeds
and
where
we
can
not
by
force
prevent
it
and
help
the
truth
we
should
at
least
confess
it
and
do
what
we
can
with
words
not
take
the
part
of
the
unrighteous
not
approve
them
but
speak
the
truth
boldly
what
would
it
help
a
man
if
he
did
all
manner
of
good
made
pilgrimages
to
rome
and
to
all
holy
places
acquired
all
indulgences
built
all
churches
and
endowed
houses
if
he
were
found
guilty
of
sin
against
the
name
and
honor
of
god
not
speaking
of
them
and
neglecting
them
and
regarding
his
possessions
honor
favor
and
friends
more
than
the
truth
which
is
god
name
and
honor
or
who
is
he
before
whose
door
and
into
whose
house
such
good
works
do
not
daily
come
so
that
he
would
have
no
need
to
travel
far
or
to
ask
after
good
works
and
if
we
consider
the
life
of
men
how
in
every
place
men
act
so
very
rashly
and
lightly
in
this
respect
we
must
cry
out
with
the
prophet
omnis
homo
mendax
all
men
are
liars
lie
and
deceive
for
the
real
good
works
they
neglect
and
adorn
and
paint
themselves
with
the
most
insignificant
and
want
to
be
pious
to
mount
to
heaven
in
peaceful
security
but
if
you
should
say
why
does
not
god
do
it
alone
and
himself
since
he
can
and
knows
how
to
help
each
one
yes
he
can
do
it
but
he
does
not
want
to
do
it
alone
he
wants
us
to
work
with
him
and
does
us
the
honor
to
want
to
work
his
work
with
us
and
through
us
and
if
we
are
not
willing
to
accept
such
honor
he
will
after
all
perform
the
work
alone
and
help
the
poor
and
those
who
were
unwilling
to
help
him
and
have
despised
the
great
honor
of
doing
his
work
he
will
condemn
with
the
unrighteous
because
they
have
made
common
cause
with
the
unrighteous
just
as
he
alone
is
blessed
but
he
wants
to
do
us
the
honor
and
not
be
alone
in
his
blessedness
but
have
us
to
be
blessed
with
him
and
if
he
were
to
do
it
alone
his
commandments
would
be
given
us
in
vain
because
no
one
would
have
occasion
to
exercise
himself
in
the
great
works
of
these
commandments
and
no
one
would
test
himself
to
see
whether
he
regards
god
and
his
name
as
the
highest
good
and
for
his
sake
risks
everything
xxxi
it
also
belongs
to
this
work
to
resist
all
false
seductive
erroneous
heretical
doctrines
every
misuse
of
spiritual
power
now
this
is
much
higher
for
these
use
the
holy
name
of
god
itself
to
fight
against
the
name
of
god
for
this
reason
it
seems
a
great
thing
and
a
dangerous
to
resist
them
because
they
assert
that
he
who
resists
them
resists
god
and
all
his
saints
in
whose
place
they
sit
and
whose
power
they
use
saying
that
christ
said
of
them
he
that
heareth
you
heareth
me
and
he
that
despiseth
you
despiseth
me
on
which
words
they
lean
heavily
become
insolent
and
bold
to
say
to
do
and
to
leave
undone
what
they
please
put
to
the
ban
accurse
rob
murder
and
practise
all
their
wickedness
in
whatever
way
they
please
and
can
invent
without
any
hindrance
now
christ
did
not
mean
that
we
should
listen
to
them
in
everything
they
might
say
and
do
but
only
then
when
they
present
to
us
his
word
the
gospel
not
their
word
his
work
and
not
their
work
how
else
could
we
know
whether
their
lies
and
sins
were
to
be
avoided
there
must
be
some
rule
to
what
extent
we
are
to
hear
and
to
follow
them
and
this
rule
can
not
be
given
by
them
but
must
be
established
by
god
over
them
that
it
may
serve
us
as
a
guide
as
we
shall
hear
in
the
fourth
commandment
it
must
be
indeed
that
even
in
the
spiritual
estate
the
greater
part
preach
false
doctrine
and
misuse
spiritual
power
so
that
thus
occasion
may
be
given
us
to
do
the
works
of
this
commandment
and
that
we
be
tried
to
see
what
we
are
willing
to
do
and
to
leave
undone
against
such
blasphemers
for
the
sake
of
god
honor
oh
if
we
were
in
this
matter
how
often
would
the
knaves
of
officiales
have
to
decree
their
papal
and
episcopal
ban
in
vain
how
weak
the
roman
thunderbolts
would
become
how
often
would
many
a
one
have
to
hold
his
tongue
to
whom
the
world
must
now
give
ear
how
few
preachers
would
be
found
in
christendom
but
it
has
gotten
the
upper
hand
whatever
they
assert
and
in
whatever
way
that
must
be
right
here
no
one
fights
for
god
name
and
honor
and
i
hold
that
no
greater
or
more
frequent
sin
is
done
in
external
works
than
under
this
head
it
is
a
matter
so
high
that
few
understand
it
and
besides
adorned
with
god
name
and
power
dangerous
to
touch
but
the
prophets
of
old
were
masters
in
this
also
the
apostles
especially
paul
who
did
not
allow
it
to
trouble
them
whether
the
highest
or
the
lowest
priest
had
said
it
or
had
done
it
in
god
name
or
in
his
own
they
looked
on
the
works
and
words
and
held
them
up
to
god
commandment
no
matter
whether
big
john
or
little
nick
said
it
or
whether
they
had
done
it
in
god
name
or
in
man
and
for
this
they
had
to
die
and
of
such
dying
there
would
be
much
more
to
say
in
our
time
for
things
are
much
worse
now
but
christ
and
peter
and
paul
must
cover
all
this
with
their
holy
names
so
that
no
more
infamous
cover
for
infamy
has
been
found
on
earth
than
the
most
holy
and
most
blessed
name
of
jesus
christ
one
might
shudder
to
be
alive
simply
because
of
the
misuse
and
blasphemy
of
the
holy
name
of
god
through
which
if
it
shall
last
much
longer
we
will
as
i
fear
openly
worship
the
devil
as
a
god
so
completely
do
the
spiritual
authorities
and
the
learned
lack
all
understanding
in
these
things
it
is
high
time
that
we
pray
god
earnestly
that
he
hallow
his
name
but
it
will
cost
blood
and
they
who
enjoy
the
inheritance
of
the
holy
martyrs
and
are
won
with
their
blood
must
again
make
martyrs
of
this
more
another
time
i
we
have
now
seen
how
many
good
works
there
are
in
the
second
commandment
which
however
are
not
good
in
themselves
unless
they
are
done
in
faith
and
in
the
assurance
of
divine
favor
and
how
much
we
must
do
if
we
take
heed
to
this
commandment
alone
and
how
we
alas
busy
ourselves
much
with
other
works
which
have
no
agreement
at
all
with
it
now
follows
the
third
commandment
thou
shalt
hallow
the
day
of
rest
in
the
first
commandment
is
prescribed
our
heart
attitude
toward
god
in
thoughts
in
the
second
that
of
our
mouth
in
words
in
this
third
is
prescribed
our
attitude
toward
god
in
works
and
it
is
the
first
and
right
table
of
moses
on
which
these
three
commandments
are
written
and
they
govern
man
on
the
right
side
namely
in
the
things
which
concern
god
and
in
which
god
has
to
do
with
man
and
man
with
god
without
the
mediation
of
any
creature
the
first
works
of
this
commandment
are
plain
and
outward
which
we
commonly
call
worship
such
as
going
to
mass
praying
and
hearing
a
sermon
on
holy
days
so
understood
there
are
very
few
works
in
this
commandment
and
these
if
they
are
not
done
in
assurance
of
and
with
faith
in
god
favor
are
nothing
as
was
said
above
hence
it
would
also
be
a
good
thing
if
there
were
fewer
saint
days
since
in
our
times
the
works
done
on
them
are
for
the
greater
part
worse
than
those
of
the
work
days
what
with
loafing
gluttony
and
drunkenness
gambling
and
other
evil
deeds
and
then
the
mass
and
the
sermon
are
listened
to
without
edification
the
prayer
is
spoken
without
faith
it
almost
happens
that
men
think
it
is
sufficient
that
we
look
on
at
the
mass
with
our
eyes
hear
the
preaching
with
our
ears
and
say
the
prayers
with
our
mouths
it
is
all
so
formal
and
superficial
we
do
not
think
that
we
might
receive
something
out
of
the
mass
into
our
hearts
learn
and
remember
something
out
of
the
preaching
seek
desire
and
expect
something
in
our
prayer
although
in
this
matter
the
bishops
and
priests
or
they
to
whom
the
work
of
preaching
is
entrusted
are
most
at
fault
because
they
do
not
preach
the
gospel
and
do
not
teach
the
people
how
they
ought
to
look
on
at
mass
hear
preaching
and
pray
therefore
we
will
briefly
explain
these
three
works
ii
in
the
mass
it
is
necessary
that
we
attend
with
our
a
hearts
also
and
we
do
attend
when
we
exercise
faith
in
our
hearts
here
we
must
repeat
the
words
of
christ
when
he
institutes
the
mass
and
says
take
and
eat
this
is
my
body
which
is
given
for
you
in
like
manner
over
the
cup
take
and
drink
ye
all
of
it
this
is
a
new
everlasting
testament
in
my
blood
which
is
shed
for
you
and
for
many
for
the
remission
of
sins
this
shall
ye
do
as
oft
as
ye
do
it
in
remembrance
of
me
in
these
words
christ
has
made
for
himself
a
memorial
or
anniversary
to
be
daily
observed
in
all
christendom
and
has
added
to
it
a
glorious
rich
great
testament
in
which
no
interest
money
or
temporal
possessions
are
bequeathed
and
distributed
but
the
forgiveness
of
all
sins
grace
and
mercy
unto
eternal
life
that
all
who
come
to
this
memorial
shall
have
the
same
testament
and
then
he
died
whereby
this
testament
has
become
permanent
and
irrevocable
in
proof
and
evidence
of
which
instead
of
letter
and
seal
he
has
left
with
us
his
own
body
and
blood
under
the
bread
and
wine
here
there
is
need
that
a
man
practise
the
first
works
of
this
commandment
right
well
that
he
doubt
not
that
what
christ
has
said
is
true
and
consider
the
testament
sure
so
that
he
make
not
christ
a
liar
for
if
you
are
present
at
mass
and
do
not
consider
nor
believe
that
here
christ
through
his
testament
has
bequeathed
and
given
you
forgiveness
of
all
your
sins
what
else
is
it
than
as
if
you
said
i
do
not
know
or
do
not
believe
that
it
is
true
that
forgiveness
of
my
sins
is
here
bequeathed
and
given
me
oh
how
many
masses
there
are
in
the
world
at
present
but
how
few
who
hear
them
with
such
faith
and
benefit
most
grievously
is
god
provoked
to
anger
thereby
for
this
reason
also
no
one
shall
or
can
reap
any
benefit
from
the
mass
except
he
be
in
trouble
of
soul
and
long
for
divine
mercy
and
desire
to
be
rid
of
his
sins
or
if
he
have
an
evil
intention
he
must
be
changed
during
the
mass
and
come
to
have
a
desire
for
this
testament
for
this
reason
in
olden
times
no
open
sinner
was
allowed
to
be
present
at
the
mass
when
this
faith
is
rightly
present
the
heart
must
be
made
joyful
by
the
testament
and
grow
warm
and
melt
in
god
love
then
will
follow
praise
and
thanksgiving
with
a
pure
heart
from
which
the
mass
is
called
in
greek
eucharistia
that
is
thanksgiving
because
we
praise
and
thank
god
for
this
comforting
rich
blessed
testament
just
as
he
gives
thanks
praises
and
is
joyful
to
whom
a
good
friend
has
presented
a
thousand
and
more
gulden
although
christ
often
fares
like
those
who
make
several
persons
rich
by
their
testament
and
these
persons
never
think
of
them
nor
praise
or
thank
them
so
our
masses
at
present
are
merely
celebrated
without
our
knowing
why
or
wherefore
and
consequently
we
neither
give
thanks
nor
love
nor
praise
remain
parched
and
hard
and
have
enough
with
our
little
prayer
of
this
more
another
time
iii
the
sermon
ought
to
be
nothing
else
than
the
proclamation
of
this
testament
but
who
can
hear
it
if
no
one
preaches
it
now
they
who
ought
to
preach
it
themselves
do
not
know
it
this
is
why
the
sermons
ramble
off
into
other
unprofitable
stories
and
thus
christ
is
forgotten
while
we
fare
like
the
man
in
ii
kings
vii
we
see
our
riches
but
do
not
enjoy
them
of
which
the
preacher
also
says
this
is
a
great
evil
when
god
giveth
a
man
riches
and
giveth
him
not
power
to
enjoy
them
so
we
look
on
at
unnumbered
masses
and
do
not
know
whether
the
mass
be
a
testament
or
what
it
be
just
as
if
it
were
any
other
common
good
work
by
itself
o
god
how
exceeding
blind
we
are
but
where
this
is
rightly
preached
it
is
necessary
that
it
be
diligently
heard
grasped
retained
often
thought
of
and
that
the
faith
be
thus
strengthened
against
all
the
temptation
of
sin
whether
past
or
present
or
to
come
lo
this
is
the
only
ceremony
or
practice
which
christ
has
instituted
in
which
his
christians
shall
assemble
exercise
themselves
and
keep
it
with
one
accord
and
this
he
did
not
make
to
be
a
mere
work
like
other
ceremonies
but
placed
into
it
a
rich
exceeding
great
treasure
to
be
offered
and
bestowed
upon
all
who
believe
on
it
this
preaching
should
induce
sinners
to
grieve
over
their
sins
and
should
kindle
in
them
a
longing
for
the
treasure
it
must
therefore
be
a
grievous
sin
not
to
hear
the
gospel
and
to
despise
such
a
treasure
and
so
rich
a
feast
to
which
we
are
bidden
but
a
much
greater
sin
not
to
preach
the
gospel
and
to
let
so
many
people
who
would
gladly
hear
it
perish
since
christ
has
so
strictly
commanded
that
the
gospel
and
this
testament
be
preached
that
he
does
not
wish
even
the
mass
to
be
celebrated
unless
the
gospel
be
preached
as
he
says
as
oft
as
ye
do
this
remember
me
that
is
as
paul
says
ye
shall
preach
of
his
death
for
this
reason
it
is
dreadful
and
horrible
in
our
times
to
be
a
bishop
pastor
and
preacher
for
no
one
any
longer
knows
this
testament
to
say
nothing
of
their
preaching
it
although
this
is
their
highest
and
only
duty
and
obligation
how
heavily
must
they
give
account
for
so
many
souls
who
must
perish
because
of
this
lack
in
preaching
iv
we
should
pray
not
as
the
custom
is
counting
many
pages
or
beads
but
fixing
our
mind
upon
some
pressing
need
desire
it
with
all
earnestness
and
exercise
faith
and
confidence
toward
god
in
the
matter
in
such
wise
that
we
do
not
doubt
that
we
shall
be
heard
so
bernard
instructs
his
brethren
and
says
dear
brethren
you
shall
by
no
means
despise
your
prayer
as
if
it
were
in
vain
for
i
tell
you
of
a
truth
that
before
you
have
uttered
the
words
the
prayer
is
already
recorded
in
heaven
and
you
shall
confidently
expect
from
god
one
of
two
things
either
that
your
prayer
will
be
granted
or
that
if
it
will
not
be
granted
the
granting
of
it
would
not
be
good
for
you
prayer
is
therefore
a
special
exercise
of
faith
and
faith
makes
the
prayer
so
acceptable
that
either
it
will
surely
be
granted
or
something
better
than
we
ask
will
be
given
in
its
stead
so
also
says
james
let
him
who
asketh
of
god
not
waver
in
faith
for
if
he
wavers
let
not
that
man
think
that
he
shall
receive
any
thing
of
the
lord
this
is
a
clear
statement
which
says
directly
he
who
does
not
trust
receives
nothing
neither
that
which
he
asks
nor
anything
better
and
to
call
forth
such
faith
christ
himself
has
said
mark
xi
therefore
i
say
unto
you
what
things
soever
ye
desire
when
ye
pray
believe
that
ye
receive
them
and
ye
shall
surely
have
them
and
luke
xi
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
for
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
opened
or
what
father
is
there
of
you
who
if
his
son
shall
ask
bread
will
he
give
him
a
stone
or
if
he
ask
a
fish
will
he
give
him
a
serpent
or
if
he
ask
an
egg
will
he
give
him
a
scorpion
but
if
you
know
how
to
give
good
gifts
to
your
children
and
you
yourselves
are
not
naturally
good
how
much
more
shall
your
father
which
is
in
heaven
give
a
good
spirit
to
all
them
that
ask
him
who
is
so
hard
and
that
such
mighty
words
ought
not
to
move
him
to
pray
with
all
confidence
joyfully
and
gladly
but
how
many
prayers
must
be
reformed
if
we
are
to
pray
aright
according
to
these
words
now
indeed
all
churches
and
monastic
houses
are
full
of
praying
and
singing
but
how
does
it
happen
that
so
little
improvement
and
benefit
result
from
it
and
things
daily
grow
worse
the
reason
is
none
other
than
that
which
james
indicates
when
he
says
you
ask
much
and
receive
not
because
ye
ask
amiss
for
where
this
faith
and
confidence
is
not
in
the
prayer
the
prayer
is
dead
and
nothing
more
than
a
grievous
labor
and
work
if
anything
is
given
for
it
it
is
none
the
less
only
temporal
benefit
without
any
blessing
and
help
for
the
soul
nay
to
the
great
injury
and
blinding
of
souls
so
that
they
go
their
way
babbling
much
with
their
mouths
regardless
of
whether
they
receive
or
desire
or
trust
and
in
this
unbelief
the
state
of
mind
most
opposed
to
the
exercise
of
faith
and
to
the
nature
of
prayer
they
remain
hardened
from
this
it
follows
that
one
who
prays
aright
never
doubts
that
his
prayer
is
surely
acceptable
and
heard
although
the
very
thing
for
which
he
prays
be
not
given
him
for
we
are
to
lay
our
need
before
god
in
prayer
but
not
prescribe
to
him
a
measure
manner
time
or
place
but
if
he
wills
to
give
it
to
us
better
or
in
another
way
than
we
think
we
are
to
leave
it
to
him
for
frequently
we
do
not
know
what
we
pray
as
paul
says
romans
viii
and
god
works
and
gives
above
all
that
we
understand
as
he
says
ephesians
iii
so
that
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
prayer
is
acceptable
and
heard
and
we
yet
leave
to
god
the
time
place
measure
and
limit
he
will
surely
do
what
is
right
they
are
the
true
worshipers
who
worship
god
in
spirit
and
in
truth
for
they
who
believe
not
that
they
will
be
heard
sin
upon
the
left
hand
against
this
commandment
and
go
far
astray
with
their
unbelief
but
they
who
set
a
limit
for
him
sin
upon
the
other
side
and
come
too
close
with
their
tempting
of
god
so
he
has
forbidden
both
that
we
should
err
from
his
commandment
neither
to
the
left
nor
to
the
right
that
is
neither
with
unbelief
nor
with
tempting
but
with
simple
faith
remain
on
the
straight
road
trusting
him
and
yet
setting
him
no
bounds
vi
thus
we
see
that
this
commandment
like
the
second
is
to
be
nothing
else
than
a
doing
and
keeping
of
the
first
commandment
that
is
of
faith
trust
confidence
hope
and
love
to
god
so
that
in
all
the
commandments
the
first
may
be
the
captain
and
faith
the
chief
work
and
the
life
of
all
other
works
without
which
as
was
said
they
can
not
be
good
but
if
you
say
what
if
i
can
not
believe
that
my
prayer
is
heard
and
accepted
i
answer
for
this
very
reason
faith
prayer
and
all
other
good
works
are
commanded
that
you
shall
know
what
you
can
and
what
you
can
not
do
and
when
you
find
that
you
can
not
so
believe
and
do
then
you
are
humbly
to
confess
it
to
god
and
so
begin
with
a
weak
spark
of
faith
and
daily
strengthen
it
more
and
more
by
exercising
it
in
all
your
living
and
doing
for
as
touching
infirmity
of
faith
that
is
of
the
first
and
highest
commandment
there
is
no
one
on
earth
who
does
not
have
his
good
share
of
it
for
even
the
holy
apostles
in
the
gospel
and
especially
peter
were
weak
in
faith
so
that
they
also
prayed
christ
and
said
lord
increase
our
faith
and
he
very
frequently
rebukes
them
because
they
have
so
little
faith
therefore
you
shall
not
despair
nor
give
up
even
if
you
find
that
you
do
not
believe
as
firmly
as
you
ought
and
wish
in
your
prayer
or
in
other
works
nay
you
shall
thank
god
with
all
your
heart
that
he
thus
reveals
to
you
your
weakness
through
which
he
daily
teaches
and
admonishes
you
how
much
you
need
to
exercise
yourself
and
daily
strengthen
yourself
in
faith
for
how
many
do
you
see
who
habitually
pray
sing
read
work
and
seem
to
be
great
saints
and
yet
never
get
so
far
as
to
know
where
they
stand
in
respect
of
the
chief
work
faith
and
so
in
their
blindness
they
lead
astray
themselves
and
others
think
they
are
very
well
off
and
so
unknowingly
build
on
the
sand
of
their
works
without
any
faith
not
on
god
mercy
and
promise
through
a
firm
pure
faith
therefore
however
long
we
live
we
shall
always
have
our
hands
full
to
remain
with
all
our
works
and
sufferings
pupils
of
the
first
commandment
and
of
faith
and
not
to
cease
to
learn
no
one
knows
what
a
great
thing
it
is
to
trust
god
alone
except
he
who
attempts
it
with
his
works
vii
again
if
no
other
work
were
commanded
would
not
prayer
alone
suffice
to
exercise
the
whole
life
of
man
in
faith
for
this
work
the
spiritual
estate
has
been
specially
established
as
indeed
in
olden
times
some
fathers
prayed
day
and
night
nay
there
is
no
christian
who
does
not
have
time
to
pray
without
ceasing
but
i
mean
the
spiritual
praying
that
is
no
one
is
so
heavily
burdened
with
his
labor
but
that
if
he
will
he
can
while
working
speak
with
god
in
his
heart
lay
before
him
his
need
and
that
of
other
men
ask
for
help
make
petition
and
in
all
this
exercise
and
strengthen
his
faith
this
is
what
the
lord
means
luke
xviii
when
he
says
men
ought
always
to
pray
and
never
cease
although
in
matthew
vi
he
forbids
the
use
of
much
speaking
and
long
prayers
because
of
which
he
rebukes
the
hypocrites
not
because
the
lengthy
prayer
of
the
lips
is
evil
but
because
it
is
not
that
true
prayer
which
can
be
made
at
all
times
and
without
the
inner
prayer
of
faith
is
nothing
for
we
must
also
practise
the
outward
prayer
in
its
proper
time
especially
in
the
mass
as
this
commandment
requires
and
wherever
it
is
helpful
to
the
inner
prayer
and
faith
whether
in
the
house
or
in
the
field
in
this
work
or
in
that
of
which
we
have
no
time
now
to
speak
more
for
this
belongs
to
the
lord
prayer
in
which
all
petitions
and
spoken
prayer
are
summed
up
in
brief
words
viii
where
now
are
they
who
desire
to
know
and
to
do
good
works
let
them
undertake
prayer
alone
and
rightly
exercise
themselves
in
faith
and
they
will
find
that
it
is
true
as
the
holy
fathers
have
said
that
there
is
no
work
like
prayer
mumbling
with
the
mouth
is
easy
or
at
least
considered
easy
but
with
earnestness
of
heart
to
follow
the
words
in
deep
devotion
that
is
with
desire
and
faith
so
that
one
earnestly
desires
what
the
words
say
and
not
to
doubt
that
it
will
be
heard
that
is
a
great
deed
in
god
eyes
here
the
evil
spirit
hinders
men
with
all
his
powers
oh
how
often
will
he
here
prevent
the
desire
to
pray
not
allow
us
to
find
time
and
place
nay
often
also
raise
doubts
whether
a
man
is
worthy
to
ask
anything
of
such
a
majesty
as
god
is
and
so
confuse
us
that
a
man
himself
does
not
know
whether
it
is
really
true
that
he
prays
or
not
whether
it
is
possible
that
his
prayer
is
acceptable
and
other
such
strange
thoughts
for
the
evil
spirit
knows
well
how
powerful
one
truly
believing
prayer
is
and
how
it
hurts
him
and
how
it
benefits
all
men
therefore
he
does
not
willingly
let
it
happen
when
so
tempted
a
man
must
indeed
be
wise
and
not
doubt
that
he
and
his
prayer
are
indeed
unworthy
before
such
infinite
majesty
in
no
wise
dare
he
trust
his
worthiness
or
because
of
his
unworthiness
grow
faint
but
he
must
heed
god
command
and
cast
this
up
to
him
and
hold
it
before
the
devil
and
say
because
of
my
worthiness
i
do
nothing
because
of
my
unworthiness
i
cease
from
nothing
i
pray
and
work
only
because
god
of
his
pure
mercy
has
promised
to
hear
and
to
be
gracious
to
all
unworthy
men
and
not
only
promised
it
but
he
has
also
most
sternly
on
pain
of
his
everlasting
displeasure
and
wrath
commanded
us
to
pray
to
trust
and
to
receive
if
it
has
not
been
too
much
for
that
high
majesty
so
solemnly
and
highly
to
obligate
his
unworthy
worms
to
pray
to
trust
and
to
receive
from
him
how
shall
it
be
too
much
for
me
to
take
such
command
upon
myself
with
all
joy
however
worthy
or
unworthy
i
may
be
thus
we
must
drive
out
the
devil
suggestion
with
god
command
thus
will
he
cease
and
in
no
other
way
whatever
ix
but
what
are
the
things
which
we
must
bring
before
almighty
god
in
prayer
and
lamentation
to
exercise
faith
thereby
answer
first
every
man
own
besetting
need
and
trouble
of
which
david
says
psalm
xxxii
thou
art
my
refuge
in
all
trouble
which
compasseth
me
about
thou
art
my
comfort
to
preserve
me
from
all
evil
which
surrounds
me
likewise
psalm
cxlii
i
cried
unto
the
lord
with
my
voice
with
my
voice
unto
the
lord
did
i
make
my
supplication
i
poured
out
my
complaint
before
him
i
showed
before
him
my
trouble
in
the
mass
a
christian
shall
keep
in
mind
the
or
excesses
he
feels
and
pour
out
all
these
freely
before
god
with
weeping
and
groaning
as
woefully
as
he
can
as
to
his
faithful
father
who
is
ready
to
help
him
and
if
you
do
not
know
or
recognise
your
need
or
have
no
trouble
then
you
shall
know
that
you
are
in
the
worst
possible
plight
for
this
is
the
greatest
trouble
that
you
find
yourself
so
hardened
and
insensible
that
no
trouble
moves
you
there
is
no
better
mirror
in
which
to
see
your
need
than
simply
the
ten
commandments
in
which
you
will
find
what
you
lack
and
what
you
should
seek
if
therefore
you
find
in
yourself
a
weak
faith
small
hope
and
little
love
toward
god
and
that
you
do
not
praise
and
honor
god
but
love
your
own
honor
and
fame
think
much
of
the
favor
of
men
do
not
gladly
hear
mass
and
sermon
are
indolent
in
prayer
in
which
things
every
one
has
faults
then
you
shall
think
more
of
these
faults
than
of
all
bodily
harm
to
goods
honor
and
life
and
believe
that
they
are
worse
than
death
and
all
mortal
sickness
these
you
shall
earnestly
lay
before
god
lament
and
ask
for
help
and
with
all
confidence
expect
help
and
believe
that
you
are
heard
and
shall
obtain
help
and
mercy
then
go
forward
into
the
second
table
of
the
commandments
and
see
how
disobedient
you
have
been
and
still
are
toward
father
and
mother
and
all
in
authority
how
you
sin
against
your
neighbor
with
anger
hatred
and
evil
words
how
you
are
tempted
to
unchastity
covetousness
and
injustice
in
word
and
deed
against
your
neighbor
and
you
will
doubtless
find
that
you
are
full
of
all
need
and
misery
and
have
reason
enough
to
weep
even
drops
of
blood
if
you
could
x
but
i
know
well
that
many
are
so
foolish
as
not
to
want
to
ask
for
such
things
unless
they
first
be
conscious
that
they
are
pure
and
believe
that
god
hears
no
one
who
is
a
sinner
all
this
is
the
work
of
those
false
preachers
who
teach
men
to
begin
not
with
faith
and
trust
in
god
favor
but
with
their
own
works
look
you
wretched
man
if
you
have
broken
a
leg
or
the
peril
of
death
overtakes
you
you
call
upon
god
this
saint
and
that
and
do
not
wait
until
your
leg
is
healed
or
the
danger
is
past
you
are
not
so
foolish
as
to
think
that
god
hears
no
one
whose
leg
is
broken
or
who
is
in
bodily
danger
nay
you
believe
that
god
shall
hear
most
of
all
when
you
are
in
the
greatest
need
and
fear
why
then
are
you
so
foolish
here
where
there
is
immeasurably
greater
need
and
eternal
hurt
and
do
not
want
to
ask
for
faith
hope
love
humility
obedience
chastity
gentleness
peace
righteousness
unless
you
are
already
free
of
all
your
unbelief
doubt
pride
disobedience
unchastity
anger
covetousness
and
unrighteousness
although
the
more
you
find
yourself
lacking
in
these
things
the
more
and
more
diligently
you
ought
to
pray
or
cry
so
blind
are
we
with
our
bodily
sickness
and
need
we
run
to
god
with
the
soul
sickness
we
run
from
him
and
are
unwilling
to
come
back
before
we
are
well
exactly
as
if
there
could
be
one
god
who
could
help
the
body
and
another
god
who
could
help
the
soul
or
as
if
we
would
help
ourselves
in
spiritual
need
although
it
really
is
greater
than
the
bodily
need
such
plan
and
counsel
is
of
the
devil
not
so
my
good
man
if
you
wish
to
be
cured
of
sin
you
must
not
withdraw
from
god
but
run
to
him
and
pray
with
much
more
confidence
than
if
a
bodily
need
had
overtaken
you
god
is
not
hostile
to
sinners
but
only
to
unbelievers
that
is
to
such
as
do
not
recognize
and
lament
their
sin
nor
seek
help
against
it
from
god
but
in
their
own
presumption
wish
first
to
purify
themselves
are
unwilling
to
be
in
need
of
his
grace
and
will
not
suffer
him
to
be
a
god
who
gives
to
everyone
and
takes
nothing
in
return
xi
all
this
has
been
said
of
prayer
for
personal
needs
and
of
prayer
in
general
but
the
prayer
which
really
belongs
to
this
commandment
and
is
called
a
work
of
the
holy
day
is
far
better
and
greater
and
is
to
be
made
for
all
christendom
for
all
the
need
of
all
men
of
foe
and
friend
especially
for
those
who
belong
to
the
parish
or
bishopric
thus
paul
commanded
his
disciple
timothy
exhort
thee
that
thou
see
to
it
that
prayers
and
intercessions
be
made
for
all
men
for
kings
and
for
all
that
are
in
authority
that
we
may
lead
a
quiet
and
peaceable
life
in
all
godliness
and
honesty
for
this
is
good
and
acceptable
in
the
sight
of
god
our
saviour
for
this
reason
jeremiah
chapter
xxix
commanded
the
people
of
israel
to
pray
for
the
city
and
land
of
babylon
because
in
the
peace
thereof
they
should
have
peace
and
baruch
i
pray
for
the
life
of
the
king
of
babylon
and
for
the
life
of
his
son
that
we
may
live
in
peace
under
their
rule
this
common
prayer
is
precious
and
the
most
powerful
and
it
is
for
its
sake
that
we
come
together
for
this
reason
also
the
church
is
called
a
house
of
prayer
because
in
it
we
are
as
a
congregation
with
one
accord
to
consider
our
need
and
the
needs
of
all
men
present
them
before
god
and
call
upon
him
for
mercy
but
this
must
be
done
with
emotion
and
sincerity
so
that
we
feel
in
our
hearts
the
need
of
all
men
and
that
we
pray
with
true
sympathy
for
them
in
true
faith
and
confidence
where
such
prayers
are
not
made
in
the
mass
it
were
better
to
omit
the
mass
for
what
sense
is
there
in
our
coming
together
into
a
house
of
prayer
which
coming
together
shows
that
we
should
make
common
prayer
and
petition
for
the
entire
congregation
if
we
scatter
these
prayers
and
so
distribute
them
that
everyone
prays
only
for
himself
and
no
one
has
regard
for
the
other
nor
concerns
himself
for
need
how
can
that
prayer
be
of
help
good
acceptable
and
a
common
prayer
or
a
work
of
the
holy
day
and
of
the
assembled
congregation
which
they
make
who
make
their
own
petty
prayers
one
for
this
the
other
for
that
and
have
nothing
but
selfish
prayers
which
god
hates
xii
a
suggestion
of
this
common
prayer
has
been
retained
from
ancient
practice
when
at
the
end
of
the
sermon
the
confession
of
sins
is
said
and
prayer
is
made
on
the
pulpit
for
all
christendom
but
this
should
not
be
the
end
of
the
matter
as
is
now
the
custom
and
fashion
it
should
be
an
exhortation
to
pray
throughout
the
entire
mass
for
such
need
as
the
preacher
makes
us
feel
and
in
order
that
we
may
pray
worthily
he
first
exhorts
us
because
of
our
sin
and
thereby
makes
us
humble
this
should
be
done
as
briefly
as
possible
that
then
the
entire
congregation
may
confess
their
own
sin
and
pray
for
every
one
with
earnestness
and
faith
oh
if
god
granted
that
any
congregation
at
all
heard
mass
and
prayed
in
this
way
so
that
a
common
earnest
of
the
entire
people
would
rise
up
to
god
what
immeasurable
virtue
and
help
would
result
from
such
a
prayer
what
more
terrible
thing
could
happen
to
all
the
evil
spirits
what
greater
work
could
be
done
on
earth
whereby
so
many
pious
souls
would
be
preserved
so
many
sinners
converted
for
indeed
the
christian
church
on
earth
has
no
greater
power
or
work
than
such
common
prayer
against
everything
that
may
oppose
it
this
the
evil
spirit
knows
well
and
therefore
he
does
all
that
he
can
to
prevent
such
prayer
gleefully
he
lets
us
go
on
building
churches
endowing
many
monastic
houses
making
music
reading
singing
observing
many
masses
and
multiplying
ceremonies
beyond
all
measure
this
does
not
grieve
him
nay
he
helps
us
do
it
that
we
may
consider
such
things
the
very
best
and
think
that
thereby
we
have
done
our
whole
duty
but
in
that
meanwhile
this
common
effectual
and
fruitful
prayer
perishes
and
its
omission
is
unnoticed
because
of
such
display
in
this
he
has
what
he
seeks
for
when
prayer
languishes
no
one
will
take
anything
from
him
and
no
one
will
withstand
him
but
if
he
noticed
that
we
wished
to
practise
this
prayer
even
if
it
were
under
a
straw
roof
or
in
a
he
would
indeed
not
endure
it
but
would
fear
such
a
far
more
than
all
the
high
big
and
beautiful
churches
towers
and
bells
in
existence
if
such
prayer
be
not
in
them
it
is
indeed
not
a
question
of
the
places
and
buildings
in
which
we
assemble
but
only
of
this
unconquerable
prayer
that
we
pray
it
and
bring
it
before
god
as
a
truly
common
prayer
xiii
the
power
of
this
prayer
we
see
in
the
fact
that
in
olden
times
abraham
prayed
for
the
five
cities
sodom
gomorrah
genesis
xviii
and
accomplished
so
much
that
if
there
had
been
ten
righteous
people
in
them
two
in
each
city
god
would
not
have
destroyed
them
what
then
could
many
men
do
if
they
united
in
calling
upon
god
earnestly
and
with
sincere
confidence
james
also
says
dear
brethren
pray
for
one
another
that
ye
may
be
saved
for
the
prayer
of
a
righteous
man
availeth
much
a
prayer
that
perseveres
and
does
not
cease
that
is
which
does
not
cease
asking
ever
more
and
more
although
what
it
asks
is
not
immediately
granted
as
some
timid
men
do
and
as
an
example
in
this
matter
he
sets
before
us
elijah
the
prophet
who
was
a
man
he
says
as
we
are
and
prayed
that
it
might
not
rain
and
it
rained
not
by
the
space
of
three
years
and
six
months
and
he
prayed
again
and
it
rained
and
everything
became
fruitful
there
are
many
texts
and
examples
in
the
scriptures
which
urge
us
to
pray
only
that
it
be
done
with
earnestness
and
faith
as
david
says
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
upon
the
righteous
and
his
ears
are
open
unto
their
cry
again
the
lord
is
nigh
unto
all
them
that
call
upon
him
to
all
that
call
upon
him
in
truth
why
does
he
add
call
upon
him
in
truth
because
that
is
not
prayer
nor
calling
upon
god
when
the
mouth
alone
mumbles
what
should
god
do
if
you
come
along
with
your
mouth
book
or
paternoster
and
think
of
nothing
except
that
you
may
finish
the
words
and
complete
the
number
so
that
if
some
one
were
to
ask
you
what
it
all
was
about
or
what
it
was
that
you
prayed
for
you
yourself
would
not
know
for
you
had
not
thought
of
laying
this
or
that
matter
before
god
or
desiring
it
your
only
reason
for
praying
is
that
you
are
commanded
to
pray
this
and
so
much
and
this
you
intend
to
do
in
full
what
wonder
that
thunder
and
lightning
frequently
set
churches
on
fire
because
we
thus
make
of
the
house
of
prayer
a
house
of
mockery
and
call
that
prayer
in
which
we
bring
nothing
before
god
and
desire
nothing
from
him
but
we
should
do
as
they
do
who
wish
to
ask
a
favor
of
great
princes
these
do
not
plan
merely
to
babble
a
certain
number
of
words
for
the
prince
would
think
they
mocked
him
or
were
insane
but
they
put
their
request
very
plainly
and
present
their
need
earnestly
and
then
leave
it
to
his
mercy
in
good
confidence
that
he
will
grant
it
so
we
must
deal
with
god
of
definite
things
namely
mention
some
present
need
commend
it
to
his
mercy
and
and
not
doubt
that
it
is
heard
for
he
has
promised
to
hear
such
prayer
which
no
earthly
lord
has
done
xiv
we
are
masters
in
this
form
of
prayer
when
we
suffer
bodily
need
when
we
are
sick
we
call
here
upon
christopher
there
upon
barbara
we
vow
a
pilgrimage
to
james
to
this
place
and
to
that
then
we
make
earnest
prayer
have
a
good
confidence
and
every
good
kind
of
prayer
but
when
we
are
in
our
churches
during
mass
we
stand
like
images
of
saints
know
nothing
to
speak
of
or
to
lament
the
beads
rattle
the
pages
rustle
and
the
mouth
babbles
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
it
but
if
you
ask
what
you
shall
speak
of
and
lament
in
your
prayer
you
can
easily
learn
from
the
ten
commandments
and
the
lord
prayer
open
your
eyes
and
look
into
your
life
and
the
life
of
all
christians
especially
of
the
spiritual
estate
and
you
will
find
how
faith
hope
love
obedience
chastity
and
every
virtue
languish
and
all
manner
of
heinous
vices
reign
what
a
lack
there
is
of
good
preachers
and
prelates
how
only
knaves
children
fools
and
women
rule
then
you
will
see
that
there
were
need
every
hour
without
ceasing
to
pray
everywhere
with
tears
of
blood
to
god
who
is
so
terribly
angry
with
men
and
it
is
true
that
it
has
never
been
more
necessary
to
pray
than
at
this
time
and
it
will
be
more
so
from
now
on
to
the
end
of
the
world
if
such
terrible
crimes
do
not
move
you
to
lament
and
complain
do
not
permit
yourself
to
be
led
astray
by
your
rank
station
good
works
or
prayer
there
is
no
christian
vein
or
trait
in
you
however
righteous
you
may
be
but
it
has
all
been
foretold
that
when
anger
is
greatest
and
christendom
suffers
the
greatest
need
then
petitioners
and
supplicants
before
god
shall
not
be
found
as
isaiah
says
with
tears
chapter
lxiv
thou
art
angry
with
us
and
there
is
none
that
calleth
upon
thy
name
that
stirreth
up
himself
to
take
hold
of
thee
likewise
ezekiel
xxii
i
sought
for
a
man
among
them
that
should
make
up
the
hedge
and
stand
in
the
gap
before
me
for
the
land
that
i
should
not
destroy
it
but
i
found
none
therefore
have
i
poured
out
mine
indignation
upon
them
i
have
consumed
them
with
the
fire
of
my
wrath
with
these
words
god
indicates
how
he
wants
us
to
withstand
him
and
turn
away
his
anger
from
one
another
as
it
is
frequently
written
of
the
prophet
moses
that
he
restrained
god
lest
his
anger
should
overwhelm
the
people
of
israel
xv
but
what
will
they
do
who
not
only
do
not
regard
such
misfortune
of
christendom
and
do
not
pray
against
it
but
laugh
at
it
take
pleasure
in
it
condemn
malign
sing
and
talk
of
their
sins
and
yet
dare
unafraid
and
unashamed
go
to
church
hear
mass
say
prayers
and
regard
themselves
and
are
regarded
as
pious
christians
these
truly
are
in
need
that
we
pray
twice
for
them
if
we
pray
once
for
those
whom
they
condemn
talk
about
and
laugh
at
that
there
would
be
such
is
also
prophesied
by
the
thief
on
christ
left
hand
who
blasphemed
him
in
his
suffering
weakness
and
need
also
by
all
those
who
reviled
christ
on
the
cross
when
they
should
most
of
all
have
helped
him
o
god
how
blind
nay
how
insane
have
we
christians
become
when
will
there
be
an
end
of
wrath
o
heavenly
father
that
we
mock
at
the
misfortune
of
christendom
to
pray
for
which
we
gather
together
in
church
and
at
the
mass
that
we
blaspheme
and
condemn
men
this
is
the
fruit
of
our
mad
materialism
if
the
turk
destroys
cities
country
and
people
and
ruins
churches
we
think
a
great
injury
has
been
done
christendom
then
we
complain
and
urge
kings
and
princes
to
war
but
when
faith
perishes
love
grows
cold
god
word
is
neglected
and
all
manner
of
sin
flourishes
then
no
one
thinks
of
fighting
nay
pope
bishops
priests
and
clergy
who
ought
to
be
generals
captains
and
in
this
spiritual
warfare
against
these
spiritual
and
many
times
worse
turks
these
are
themselves
the
very
princes
and
leaders
of
such
turks
and
of
the
devil
host
just
as
judas
was
the
leader
of
the
jews
when
they
took
christ
it
had
to
be
an
apostle
a
bishop
a
priest
one
of
the
number
of
the
best
who
began
the
work
of
slaying
christ
so
also
must
christendom
be
laid
waste
by
no
others
than
those
who
ought
to
protect
it
and
yet
are
so
insane
that
they
are
ready
to
eat
up
the
turks
and
at
home
themselves
set
house
and
on
fire
and
let
them
burn
up
with
the
sheep
and
all
other
contents
and
none
the
less
worry
about
the
wolf
in
the
woods
such
are
our
times
and
this
is
the
reward
we
have
earned
by
our
ingratitude
toward
the
endless
grace
which
christ
has
won
for
us
freely
with
his
precious
blood
grievous
labor
and
bitter
death
xvi
lo
where
are
the
idle
ones
who
do
not
know
how
to
do
good
works
where
are
they
who
run
to
rome
to
james
hither
and
thither
take
up
this
one
single
work
of
the
mass
look
on
your
neighbor
sin
and
ruin
and
have
pity
on
him
let
it
grieve
you
tell
it
to
god
and
pray
over
it
do
the
same
for
every
other
need
of
christendom
especially
of
the
rulers
whom
god
for
the
intolerable
punishment
and
torment
of
us
all
allows
to
fall
and
be
misled
so
terribly
if
you
do
this
diligently
be
assured
you
are
one
of
the
best
fighters
and
captains
not
only
against
the
turks
but
also
against
the
devils
and
the
powers
of
hell
but
if
you
do
it
not
what
would
it
help
you
though
you
performed
all
the
miracles
of
the
saints
and
murdered
all
the
turks
and
yet
were
found
guilty
of
having
disregarded
your
neighbor
need
and
of
having
thereby
sinned
against
love
for
christ
at
the
last
day
will
not
ask
how
much
you
have
prayed
fasted
pilgrimaged
done
this
or
that
for
yourself
but
how
much
good
you
have
done
to
others
even
the
very
least
now
without
doubt
among
the
least
are
also
those
who
are
in
sin
and
spiritual
poverty
captivity
and
need
of
whom
there
are
at
present
far
more
than
of
those
who
suffer
bodily
need
therefore
take
heed
our
own
good
works
lead
us
to
and
into
ourselves
that
we
seek
only
our
own
benefit
and
salvation
but
god
commandments
drive
us
to
our
neighbor
that
we
may
thereby
benefit
others
to
their
salvation
just
as
christ
on
the
cross
prayed
not
for
himself
alone
but
rather
for
us
when
he
said
father
forgive
them
fort
they
know
not
what
they
do
so
we
also
must
pray
for
one
another
from
which
every
man
may
know
that
the
slanderers
frivolous
judges
and
despisers
of
other
people
are
a
perverted
evil
race
who
do
nothing
else
than
heap
abuse
on
those
for
whom
they
ought
to
pray
in
which
vice
no
one
is
sunk
so
deep
as
those
very
men
who
do
many
good
works
of
their
own
and
seem
to
men
to
be
something
extraordinary
and
are
honored
because
of
their
beautiful
splendid
life
in
manifold
good
works
xvii
spiritually
understood
this
commandment
has
a
yet
far
higher
work
which
embraces
the
whole
nature
of
man
here
it
must
be
known
that
in
hebrew
sabbath
means
rest
because
on
the
seventh
day
god
rested
and
ceased
from
all
his
works
which
he
had
made
genesis
ii
therefore
he
commanded
also
that
the
seventh
day
should
be
kept
holy
and
that
we
cease
from
our
works
which
we
do
the
other
six
days
this
sabbath
has
now
for
us
been
changed
into
the
sunday
and
the
other
days
are
called
the
sunday
is
called
or
holiday
or
holy
day
and
would
to
god
that
in
christendom
there
were
no
holiday
except
the
sunday
that
the
festivals
of
our
lady
and
of
the
saints
were
all
transferred
to
sunday
then
would
many
evil
vices
be
done
away
with
through
the
labor
of
the
and
lands
would
not
be
so
drained
and
impoverished
but
now
we
are
plagued
with
many
holidays
to
the
destruction
of
souls
bodies
and
goods
of
which
matter
much
might
be
said
this
rest
or
ceasing
from
labors
is
of
two
kinds
bodily
and
spiritual
for
this
reason
this
commandment
is
also
to
be
understood
in
two
ways
the
bodily
rest
is
that
of
which
we
have
spoken
above
namely
that
we
omit
our
business
and
work
in
order
that
we
may
gather
in
the
church
see
mass
hear
god
word
and
make
common
prayer
this
rest
is
indeed
bodily
and
in
christendom
no
longer
commanded
by
god
as
the
apostle
says
colossians
ii
let
no
man
obligate
you
to
any
holiday
whatever
for
they
were
of
old
a
figure
but
now
the
truth
has
been
fulfilled
so
that
all
days
are
holy
days
as
isaiah
says
chapter
lxvi
one
holy
day
shall
follow
the
other
on
the
other
hand
all
days
are
workdays
yet
it
is
a
necessity
and
ordained
by
the
church
for
the
sake
of
the
imperfect
laity
and
working
people
that
they
also
may
be
able
to
come
to
hear
god
word
for
as
we
see
the
priests
and
clergy
celebrate
mass
every
day
pray
at
all
hours
and
train
themselves
in
god
word
by
study
reading
and
hearing
for
this
reason
also
they
are
freed
from
work
before
others
supported
by
tithes
and
have
every
day
and
every
day
do
the
works
of
the
and
have
no
but
for
them
one
day
is
as
the
other
and
if
we
were
all
perfect
and
knew
the
gospel
we
might
work
every
day
if
we
wished
or
rest
if
we
could
for
a
day
of
rest
is
at
present
not
necessary
nor
commanded
except
only
for
the
teaching
of
god
word
and
prayer
the
spiritual
rest
which
god
particularly
intends
in
this
commandment
is
this
that
we
not
only
cease
from
our
labor
and
trade
but
much
more
that
we
let
god
alone
work
in
us
and
that
we
do
nothing
of
our
own
with
all
our
powers
but
how
is
this
done
in
this
way
man
corrupted
by
sin
has
much
wicked
love
and
inclination
toward
all
sins
as
the
scriptures
say
genesis
viii
man
heart
and
senses
incline
always
to
the
evil
that
is
to
pride
disobedience
anger
hatred
covetousness
unchastity
and
summa
summarum
in
all
that
he
does
and
leaves
undone
he
seeks
his
own
profit
will
and
honor
rather
than
god
and
his
neighbor
therefore
all
his
works
all
his
words
all
his
thoughts
all
his
life
are
evil
and
not
godly
now
if
god
is
to
work
and
to
live
in
him
all
this
vice
and
wickedness
must
be
choked
and
so
that
there
may
be
rest
and
a
cessation
of
all
our
works
thoughts
and
life
and
that
henceforth
as
paul
says
galatians
ii
it
may
be
no
longer
we
who
live
but
christ
who
lives
works
and
speaks
in
us
this
is
not
accomplished
with
comfortable
pleasant
days
but
here
we
must
hurt
our
nature
and
let
it
be
hurt
here
begins
the
strife
between
the
spirit
and
the
flesh
here
the
spirit
resists
anger
lust
pride
while
the
flesh
wants
to
be
in
pleasure
honor
and
comfort
of
this
paul
says
galatians
v
they
that
are
our
lord
christ
have
crucified
the
flesh
with
its
affections
and
lusts
then
follow
the
good
works
fasting
watching
labor
of
which
some
say
and
write
so
much
although
they
know
neither
the
source
nor
the
purpose
of
these
good
works
therefore
we
will
now
also
speak
of
them
xviii
this
rest
namely
that
our
work
cease
and
god
alone
work
in
us
is
accomplished
in
two
ways
first
through
our
own
effort
secondly
through
the
effort
or
urging
of
others
our
own
effort
is
to
be
so
made
and
ordered
that
in
the
first
place
when
we
see
our
flesh
senses
will
and
thoughts
tempting
us
we
resist
them
and
do
not
heed
them
as
the
wise
man
says
follow
not
thine
own
desires
and
moses
deuteronomy
xii
thou
shalt
not
do
what
is
right
in
thine
own
eyes
here
a
man
must
make
daily
use
of
those
prayers
which
david
prays
lord
lead
me
in
thy
path
and
let
me
not
walk
in
my
own
ways
and
many
like
prayers
which
are
all
summed
up
in
the
prayer
thy
kingdom
come
for
the
desires
are
so
many
so
various
and
besides
at
times
so
nimble
so
subtile
and
specious
through
the
suggestions
of
the
evil
one
that
it
is
not
possible
for
a
man
to
control
himself
in
his
own
ways
he
must
let
hands
and
feet
go
commend
himself
to
governance
and
entrust
nothing
to
his
reason
as
jeremiah
says
o
lord
i
know
that
the
way
of
man
is
not
in
his
own
power
we
see
proof
of
this
when
the
children
of
israel
went
out
of
egypt
through
the
wilderness
where
there
was
no
way
no
food
no
drink
no
help
therefore
god
went
before
them
by
day
in
a
bright
cloud
by
night
in
a
fiery
pillar
fed
them
with
manna
from
heaven
and
kept
their
garments
and
shoes
that
they
waxed
not
old
as
we
read
in
the
books
of
moses
for
this
reason
we
pray
thy
kingdom
come
that
thou
rule
us
and
not
we
ourselves
for
there
is
nothing
more
perilous
in
us
than
our
reason
and
will
and
this
is
the
first
and
highest
work
of
god
in
us
and
the
best
training
that
we
cease
from
our
works
that
we
let
our
reason
and
will
be
idle
that
we
rest
and
commend
ourselves
to
god
in
all
things
especially
when
they
seem
to
be
spiritual
and
good
xix
after
this
comes
the
discipline
of
the
flesh
to
kill
its
gross
evil
lust
to
give
it
rest
and
relief
this
we
must
kill
and
quiet
with
fasting
watching
and
labor
and
from
this
we
learn
how
much
and
why
we
shall
fast
watch
and
labor
there
are
alas
many
blind
men
who
practise
their
castigation
whether
it
be
fasting
watching
or
labor
only
because
they
think
these
are
good
works
intending
by
them
to
gain
much
merit
far
blinder
still
are
they
who
measure
their
fasting
not
only
by
the
quantity
or
duration
as
these
do
but
also
by
the
nature
of
the
food
thinking
that
it
is
of
far
greater
worth
if
they
do
not
eat
meat
eggs
or
butter
beyond
these
are
those
who
fast
according
to
the
saints
and
according
to
the
days
one
fasting
on
wednesday
another
on
saturday
another
on
barbara
day
another
on
sebastian
day
and
so
on
these
all
seek
in
their
fasting
nothing
beyond
the
work
itself
when
they
have
performed
that
they
think
they
have
done
a
good
work
i
will
here
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
some
fast
in
such
a
way
that
they
none
the
less
drink
themselves
full
some
fast
by
eating
fish
and
other
foods
so
lavishly
that
they
would
come
much
nearer
to
fasting
if
they
ate
meat
eggs
and
butter
and
by
so
doing
would
obtain
far
better
results
from
their
fasting
for
such
fasting
is
not
fasting
but
a
mockery
of
fasting
and
of
god
therefore
i
allow
everyone
to
choose
his
day
food
and
quantity
for
fasting
as
he
will
on
condition
that
he
do
not
stop
with
that
but
have
regard
to
his
flesh
let
him
put
upon
it
fasting
watching
and
labor
according
to
its
lust
and
wantonness
and
no
more
although
pope
church
bishop
or
any
one
else
whosoever
have
commanded
it
for
no
one
should
measure
and
regulate
fasting
watching
and
labor
according
to
the
character
or
quantity
of
the
food
or
according
to
the
days
but
according
to
the
withdrawal
or
approach
of
the
lust
and
wantonness
of
the
flesh
for
the
sake
of
which
alone
the
fasting
watching
and
labor
is
ordained
that
is
to
kill
and
to
subdue
them
if
it
were
not
for
this
lust
eating
were
as
meritorious
as
fasting
sleeping
as
watching
idleness
as
labor
and
each
were
as
good
as
the
other
without
all
distinction
xx
now
if
some
one
should
find
that
more
wantonness
arose
in
his
flesh
from
eating
fish
than
from
eating
eggs
and
meat
let
him
eat
meat
and
not
fish
again
if
he
find
that
his
head
becomes
confused
and
crazed
or
his
body
and
stomach
injured
through
fasting
or
that
it
is
not
needful
to
kill
the
wantonness
of
his
flesh
he
shall
let
fasting
alone
entirely
and
eat
sleep
be
idle
as
is
necessary
for
his
health
regardless
whether
it
be
against
the
command
of
the
church
or
the
rules
of
monastic
orders
for
no
commandment
of
the
church
no
law
of
an
order
can
make
fasting
watching
and
labor
of
more
value
than
it
has
in
serving
to
repress
or
to
kill
the
flesh
and
its
lusts
where
men
go
beyond
this
and
the
fasting
eating
sleeping
watching
are
practised
beyond
the
strength
of
the
body
and
more
than
is
necessary
to
the
killing
of
the
lust
so
that
through
it
the
natural
strength
is
ruined
and
the
head
is
racked
then
let
no
one
imagine
that
he
has
done
good
works
or
excuse
himself
by
citing
the
commandment
of
the
church
or
the
law
of
his
order
he
will
be
regarded
as
a
man
who
takes
no
care
of
himself
and
as
far
as
in
him
lies
has
become
his
own
murderer
for
the
body
is
not
given
us
that
we
should
kill
its
natural
life
or
work
but
only
that
we
kill
its
wantonness
unless
its
wantonness
were
so
strong
and
great
that
we
could
not
sufficiently
resist
it
without
ruin
and
harm
to
the
natural
life
for
as
has
been
said
in
the
practice
of
fasting
watching
and
labor
we
are
not
to
look
upon
the
works
in
themselves
not
on
the
days
not
on
the
number
not
on
the
food
but
only
on
the
wanton
and
lustful
adam
that
through
them
he
may
be
cured
of
his
evil
appetite
xxi
from
this
we
can
judge
how
wisely
or
foolishly
some
women
act
when
they
are
with
child
and
how
the
sick
are
to
be
treated
for
the
foolish
women
cling
so
firmly
to
their
fasting
that
they
run
the
risk
of
great
danger
to
the
fruit
of
their
womb
and
to
themselves
rather
than
not
to
fast
when
the
others
fast
they
make
a
matter
of
conscience
where
there
is
none
and
where
there
is
matter
of
conscience
they
make
none
this
is
all
the
fault
of
the
preachers
because
they
continually
prate
of
fasting
and
never
point
out
its
true
use
limit
fruit
cause
and
purpose
so
also
the
sick
should
be
allowed
to
eat
and
to
drink
every
day
whatever
they
wish
in
brief
where
the
wantonness
of
the
flesh
ceases
there
every
reason
for
fasting
watching
laboring
eating
this
or
that
has
already
ceased
and
there
no
longer
is
any
binding
commandment
at
all
but
then
care
must
be
taken
lest
out
of
this
freedom
there
grow
a
lazy
indifference
about
killing
the
wantonness
of
the
flesh
for
the
roguish
adam
is
exceedingly
tricky
in
looking
for
permission
for
himself
and
in
pleading
the
ruin
of
the
body
or
of
the
mind
so
some
men
jump
right
in
and
say
it
is
neither
necessary
nor
commanded
to
fast
or
to
mortify
the
flesh
and
are
ready
to
eat
this
and
that
without
fear
just
as
if
they
had
for
a
long
time
had
much
experience
of
fasting
although
they
have
never
tried
it
no
less
are
we
to
guard
against
offending
those
who
not
sufficiently
informed
regard
it
a
great
sin
if
we
do
not
fast
or
eat
as
they
do
these
we
must
kindly
instruct
and
not
haughtily
despise
nor
eat
this
or
that
in
despite
of
them
but
we
must
tell
them
the
reason
why
it
is
right
to
do
so
and
thus
gradually
lead
them
to
a
correct
understanding
but
if
they
are
stubborn
and
will
not
listen
we
must
let
them
alone
and
do
as
we
know
it
is
right
to
do
xxii
the
second
form
of
discipline
which
we
receive
at
the
hands
of
others
is
when
men
or
devils
cause
us
suffering
as
when
our
property
is
taken
our
body
sick
and
our
honor
taken
away
and
everything
that
may
move
us
to
anger
impatience
and
unrest
for
god
work
rules
in
us
according
to
his
wisdom
not
according
to
our
wisdom
according
to
his
purity
and
chastity
not
according
to
the
wantonness
of
our
flesh
for
god
work
is
wisdom
and
purity
our
work
is
foolishness
and
impurity
and
these
shall
rest
so
in
like
manner
it
should
rule
in
us
according
to
his
peace
not
our
anger
impatience
and
lack
of
peace
for
peace
too
is
god
work
impatience
is
the
work
of
our
flesh
this
shall
rest
and
be
dead
that
we
thus
in
every
way
keep
a
spiritual
holiday
let
our
works
stand
idle
and
let
god
work
in
us
therefore
in
order
to
kill
our
works
and
the
adam
in
us
god
heaps
many
temptations
upon
us
which
move
us
to
anger
many
sufferings
which
rouse
us
to
impatience
and
last
of
all
death
and
the
world
abuse
whereby
he
seeks
nothing
else
than
that
he
may
drive
out
anger
impatience
and
lack
of
peace
and
attain
to
his
work
that
is
to
peace
in
us
thus
says
isaiah
xxviii
he
does
the
work
of
another
that
he
may
come
to
his
own
work
what
does
this
mean
he
sends
us
suffering
and
trouble
that
he
may
teach
us
to
have
patience
and
peace
he
bids
us
die
that
he
may
make
us
live
until
a
man
thoroughly
trained
becomes
so
peaceful
and
quiet
that
he
is
not
disturbed
whether
it
go
well
or
ill
with
him
whether
he
die
or
live
be
honored
or
dishonored
there
god
himself
dwells
alone
and
there
are
no
works
of
men
this
is
rightly
keeping
and
hallowing
the
day
of
rest
then
a
man
does
not
guide
himself
then
he
desires
nothing
for
himself
then
nothing
troubles
him
but
god
himself
leads
him
there
is
naught
but
godly
pleasure
joy
and
peace
with
all
other
works
and
virtues
xxiii
these
works
he
considers
so
great
that
he
commands
us
not
only
to
keep
the
day
of
rest
but
also
to
hallow
it
or
regard
it
as
holy
whereby
he
declares
that
there
are
no
more
precious
things
than
suffering
dying
and
all
manner
of
misfortune
for
they
are
holy
and
sanctify
a
man
from
his
works
to
god
works
just
as
a
church
is
consecrated
from
natural
works
to
the
worship
of
god
therefore
a
man
shall
also
recognise
them
as
holy
things
be
glad
and
thank
god
when
they
come
upon
him
for
when
they
come
they
make
him
holy
so
that
he
fulfils
this
commandment
and
is
saved
redeemed
from
all
his
sinful
works
thus
says
david
precious
in
the
sight
of
the
lord
is
the
death
of
his
saints
in
order
to
strengthen
us
thereto
he
has
not
only
commanded
us
to
keep
such
a
rest
for
nature
is
very
unwilling
to
die
and
to
suffer
and
it
is
a
bitter
day
of
rest
for
it
to
cease
from
its
works
and
be
dead
but
he
has
also
comforted
us
in
the
scriptures
with
many
words
and
told
us
psalm
xci
i
will
be
with
him
in
all
his
trouble
and
will
deliver
him
likewise
psalm
xxxiv
the
lord
is
nigh
unto
all
them
that
suffer
and
will
help
them
as
if
this
were
not
enough
he
has
given
us
a
powerful
strong
example
of
it
his
only
dear
son
jesus
christ
our
lord
who
on
the
sabbath
lay
in
the
tomb
the
entire
day
of
rest
free
from
all
his
works
and
was
the
first
to
fulfil
this
commandment
although
he
needed
it
not
for
himself
but
only
for
our
comfort
that
we
also
in
all
suffering
and
death
should
be
quiet
and
have
peace
since
as
christ
was
raised
up
after
his
rest
and
henceforth
lives
only
in
god
and
god
in
him
so
also
shall
we
by
the
death
of
our
adam
which
is
perfectly
accomplished
only
through
natural
death
and
burial
be
lifted
up
into
god
that
god
may
live
and
work
in
us
forever
lo
these
are
the
three
parts
of
man
reason
desire
aversion
in
which
all
his
works
are
done
these
therefore
must
be
slain
by
these
three
exercises
god
governance
our
the
hurt
done
to
us
by
others
and
so
they
must
spiritually
rest
before
god
and
give
him
room
for
his
works
xxiv
but
such
works
are
to
be
done
and
such
sufferings
to
be
endured
in
faith
and
in
sure
confidence
of
god
favor
in
order
that
as
has
been
said
all
works
remain
in
the
first
commandment
and
in
faith
and
that
faith
for
the
sake
of
which
all
other
commandments
and
works
are
ordained
exercise
and
strengthen
itself
in
them
see
therefore
what
a
pretty
golden
ring
these
three
commandments
and
their
works
naturally
form
and
how
from
the
first
commandment
and
faith
the
second
flows
on
to
the
third
and
the
third
in
turn
drives
through
the
second
up
into
the
first
for
the
first
work
is
to
believe
to
have
a
good
heart
and
confidence
toward
god
from
this
flows
the
second
good
work
to
praise
god
name
to
confess
his
grace
to
give
all
honor
to
him
alone
then
follows
the
third
to
worship
by
praying
hearing
word
thinking
of
and
considering
god
benefits
and
in
addition
chastising
one
self
and
keeping
the
body
under
but
when
the
evil
spirit
perceives
such
faith
such
honoring
of
god
and
such
worship
he
rages
and
stirs
up
persecution
attacks
body
goods
honor
and
life
brings
upon
us
sickness
poverty
shame
and
death
which
god
so
permits
and
ordains
see
here
begins
the
second
work
or
the
second
rest
of
the
third
commandment
by
this
faith
is
very
greatly
tried
even
as
gold
in
the
fire
for
it
is
a
great
thing
to
retain
a
sure
confidence
in
god
although
he
sends
us
death
shame
sickness
poverty
and
in
this
cruel
form
of
wrath
to
regard
him
as
our
father
as
must
be
done
in
this
work
of
the
third
commandment
here
suffering
contains
faith
that
it
must
call
upon
god
name
and
praise
it
in
such
suffering
and
so
it
comes
through
the
third
commandment
into
the
second
again
and
through
that
very
calling
on
the
name
of
god
and
praise
faith
grows
and
becomes
conscious
of
itself
and
so
strengthens
itself
through
the
two
works
of
the
third
and
of
the
second
commandment
thus
faith
goes
out
into
the
works
and
through
the
works
comes
to
itself
again
just
as
the
sun
goes
forth
unto
its
setting
and
comes
again
unto
its
rising
for
this
reason
the
scriptures
associate
the
day
with
peaceful
living
in
works
the
night
with
passive
living
in
adversity
and
faith
lives
and
works
goes
out
and
comes
in
in
both
as
christ
says
john
ix
xxv
this
order
of
good
works
we
pray
in
the
lord
prayer
the
first
is
this
that
we
say
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
these
are
the
words
of
the
first
work
of
faith
which
according
to
the
first
commandment
does
not
doubt
that
it
has
a
gracious
father
in
heaven
the
second
hallowed
be
thy
name
in
which
faith
asks
that
name
praise
and
honor
be
glorified
and
calls
upon
it
in
every
need
as
the
second
commandment
says
the
third
thy
kingdom
come
in
which
we
pray
for
the
true
sabbath
and
rest
peaceful
cessation
of
our
works
that
god
work
alone
be
done
in
us
and
so
god
rule
in
us
as
in
his
own
kingdom
as
he
says
luke
xvii
behold
god
kingdom
is
nowhere
else
except
within
you
the
fourth
petition
is
thy
will
be
done
in
which
we
pray
that
we
may
keep
and
have
the
seven
commandments
of
the
second
table
in
which
faith
is
exercised
toward
our
neighbor
just
as
in
the
first
three
it
is
exercised
in
works
toward
god
alone
and
these
are
the
petitions
in
which
stands
the
word
thou
thy
thy
thy
because
they
seek
only
what
belongs
to
god
all
the
others
say
our
us
our
etc
for
in
them
we
pray
for
our
goods
and
blessedness
let
this
then
suffice
as
a
plain
hasty
explanation
of
the
first
table
of
moses
pointing
out
to
simple
folk
what
are
the
highest
of
good
works
the
second
table
follows
thou
shalt
honor
thy
father
and
thy
mother
from
this
commandment
we
learn
that
after
the
excellent
works
of
the
first
three
commandments
there
are
no
better
works
than
to
obey
and
serve
all
those
who
are
set
over
us
as
superiors
for
this
reason
also
disobedience
is
a
greater
sin
than
murder
unchastity
theft
and
dishonesty
and
all
that
these
may
include
for
we
can
in
no
better
way
learn
how
to
distinguish
between
greater
and
lesser
sins
than
by
noting
the
order
of
the
commandments
of
god
although
there
are
distinctions
also
within
the
works
of
each
commandment
for
who
does
not
know
that
to
curse
is
a
greater
sin
than
to
be
angry
to
strike
than
to
curse
to
strike
father
and
mother
more
than
to
strike
any
one
else
thus
these
seven
commandments
teach
us
how
we
are
to
exercise
ourselves
in
good
works
toward
men
and
first
of
all
toward
our
superiors
the
first
work
is
that
we
honor
our
own
father
and
mother
and
this
honor
consists
not
only
in
respectful
demeanor
but
in
this
that
we
obey
them
look
up
to
esteem
and
heed
their
words
and
example
accept
what
they
say
keep
silent
and
endure
their
treatment
of
us
so
long
as
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
first
three
commandments
in
addition
when
they
need
it
that
we
provide
them
with
food
clothing
and
shelter
for
not
for
nothing
has
he
said
thou
shalt
honor
them
he
does
not
say
thou
shalt
love
them
although
this
also
must
be
done
but
honor
is
higher
than
mere
love
and
includes
a
certain
fear
which
unites
with
love
and
causes
a
man
to
fear
offending
them
more
than
he
fears
the
punishment
just
as
there
is
fear
in
the
honor
we
pay
a
sanctuary
and
yet
we
do
not
flee
from
it
as
from
a
punishment
but
draw
near
to
it
all
the
more
such
a
fear
mingled
with
love
is
the
true
honor
the
other
fear
without
any
love
is
that
which
we
have
toward
things
which
we
despise
or
flee
from
as
we
fear
the
hangman
or
punishment
there
is
no
honor
in
that
for
it
is
a
fear
without
all
love
nay
fear
that
has
with
it
hatred
and
enmity
of
this
we
have
a
proverb
of
jerome
what
we
fear
that
we
also
hate
with
such
a
fear
god
does
not
wish
to
be
feared
or
honored
nor
to
have
us
honor
our
parents
but
with
the
first
which
is
mingled
with
love
and
confidence
ii
this
work
appears
easy
but
few
regard
it
aright
for
where
the
parents
are
truly
pious
and
love
their
children
not
according
to
the
flesh
but
as
they
ought
instruct
and
direct
them
by
words
and
works
to
serve
god
according
to
the
first
three
commandments
there
the
child
own
will
is
constantly
broken
and
it
must
do
leave
undone
and
suffer
what
its
nature
would
most
gladly
do
otherwise
and
thereby
it
finds
occasion
to
despise
its
parents
to
murmur
against
them
or
to
do
worse
things
there
love
and
fear
depart
unless
they
have
grace
in
like
manner
when
they
punish
and
chastise
as
they
ought
at
times
even
unjustly
which
however
does
not
harm
the
salvation
our
evil
nature
resents
the
correction
beside
all
this
there
are
some
so
wicked
that
they
are
ashamed
of
their
parents
because
of
poverty
lowly
birth
deformity
or
dishonor
and
allow
these
things
to
influence
them
more
than
the
high
commandment
of
god
who
is
above
all
things
and
has
with
benevolent
intent
given
them
such
parents
to
exercise
and
try
them
in
his
commandment
but
the
matter
becomes
still
worse
when
the
child
has
children
of
its
own
then
love
descends
to
them
and
detracts
very
much
from
the
love
and
honor
toward
the
parents
but
what
is
said
and
commanded
of
parents
must
also
be
understood
of
those
who
when
the
parents
are
dead
or
absent
take
their
place
such
as
relatives
sponsors
temporal
lords
and
spiritual
fathers
for
every
one
must
be
ruled
and
be
subject
to
other
men
wherefore
we
here
see
again
how
many
good
works
are
taught
in
this
commandment
since
in
it
all
our
life
is
made
subject
to
other
men
hence
it
comes
that
obedience
is
so
highly
praised
and
all
virtue
and
good
works
are
included
in
it
iii
there
is
another
dishonoring
of
parents
much
more
dangerous
and
subtile
than
this
first
which
adorns
itself
and
passes
for
a
real
honor
that
is
when
a
child
has
its
own
way
and
the
parents
through
natural
love
allow
it
here
there
is
indeed
mutual
honor
here
there
is
mutual
love
and
on
all
sides
it
is
a
precious
thing
parents
and
child
take
mutual
pleasure
in
one
another
this
plague
is
so
common
that
instances
of
the
first
form
of
dishonoring
are
very
seldom
seen
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
parents
are
blinded
and
neither
know
nor
honor
god
according
to
the
first
three
commandments
hence
also
they
can
not
see
what
the
children
lack
and
how
they
ought
to
teach
and
train
them
for
this
reason
they
train
them
for
worldly
honors
pleasure
and
possessions
that
they
may
by
all
means
please
men
and
reach
high
positions
this
the
children
like
and
they
obey
very
gladly
without
gainsaying
thus
god
commandment
secretly
comes
to
naught
while
all
seems
good
and
that
is
fulfilled
which
is
written
in
the
prophets
isaiah
and
jeremiah
that
the
children
are
destroyed
by
their
own
parents
and
they
do
like
the
king
manasseh
who
sacrificed
his
own
son
to
the
idol
moloch
and
burned
him
ii
kings
xxi
what
else
is
it
but
to
sacrifice
one
own
child
to
the
idol
and
to
burn
it
when
parents
train
their
children
more
in
the
way
of
the
world
than
in
the
way
of
god
let
them
go
their
way
and
be
burned
up
in
worldly
pleasure
love
enjoyment
possessions
and
honor
but
let
god
love
and
honor
and
the
desire
of
eternal
blessings
be
quenched
in
them
o
how
perilous
it
is
to
be
a
father
or
a
mother
where
flesh
and
blood
are
supreme
for
truly
the
knowledge
and
fulfilment
of
the
first
three
and
the
last
six
commandments
depends
altogether
upon
this
commandment
since
parents
are
commanded
to
teach
them
to
their
children
as
psalm
lxxviii
says
how
strictly
has
he
commanded
our
fathers
that
they
should
make
known
god
commandments
to
their
children
that
the
generation
to
come
might
know
them
and
declare
them
to
their
children
children
this
also
is
the
reason
why
god
bids
us
honor
our
parents
that
is
to
love
them
with
fear
for
that
other
love
is
without
fear
therefore
it
is
more
dishonor
than
honor
now
see
whether
every
one
does
not
have
good
works
enough
to
do
whether
he
be
father
or
child
but
we
blind
men
leave
this
untouched
and
seek
all
sorts
of
other
works
which
are
not
commanded
iv
now
where
parents
are
foolish
and
train
their
children
after
the
fashion
of
the
world
the
children
are
in
no
way
to
obey
them
for
god
according
to
the
first
three
commandments
is
to
be
more
highly
regarded
than
the
parents
but
training
after
the
fashion
of
the
world
i
call
it
when
they
teach
them
to
seek
no
more
than
pleasure
honor
and
possessions
of
this
world
or
its
power
to
wear
decent
clothes
and
to
seek
an
honest
living
is
a
necessity
and
not
sin
yet
the
heart
of
a
child
must
be
taught
to
be
sorry
that
this
miserable
earthly
life
can
not
well
be
lived
or
even
begun
without
the
striving
after
more
adornment
and
more
possessions
than
are
necessary
for
the
protection
of
the
body
against
cold
and
for
nourishment
thus
the
child
must
be
taught
to
grieve
that
without
its
own
will
it
must
do
the
world
will
and
play
the
fool
with
the
rest
of
men
and
endure
such
evil
for
the
sake
of
something
better
and
to
avoid
something
worse
so
queen
esther
wore
her
royal
crown
and
yet
said
to
god
esther
xiv
thou
knowest
that
the
sign
of
my
high
estate
which
is
upon
my
head
has
never
yet
delighted
me
and
i
abhor
it
as
a
menstruous
rag
and
never
wear
it
when
i
am
by
myself
but
when
i
must
do
it
and
go
before
the
people
the
heart
that
is
so
minded
wears
adornment
without
peril
for
it
wears
and
does
not
wear
dances
and
does
not
dance
lives
well
and
does
not
live
well
and
these
are
the
secret
souls
hidden
brides
of
christ
but
they
are
rare
for
it
is
hard
not
to
delight
in
great
adornment
and
parade
thus
cecilia
wore
golden
clothes
at
the
command
of
her
parents
but
within
against
her
body
she
wore
a
garment
of
hair
here
some
men
say
how
then
could
i
bring
my
children
into
society
and
marry
them
honorably
i
must
make
some
display
tell
me
are
not
these
the
words
of
a
heart
which
despairs
of
god
and
trusts
more
on
its
own
providing
than
on
god
care
whereas
peter
teaches
and
says
peter
v
cast
all
your
care
upon
him
and
be
certain
that
he
cares
for
you
it
is
a
sign
that
they
have
never
yet
thanked
god
for
their
children
have
never
yet
rightly
prayed
for
them
have
never
yet
commended
them
to
him
otherwise
they
would
know
and
have
experienced
that
they
ought
to
ask
god
also
for
the
marriage
dower
of
their
children
and
await
it
from
him
therefore
also
he
permits
them
to
go
their
way
with
cares
and
worries
and
yet
succeed
poorly
thus
it
is
true
as
men
say
that
parents
although
they
had
nothing
else
to
do
could
attain
salvation
by
training
their
own
children
if
they
rightly
train
them
to
god
service
they
will
indeed
have
both
hands
full
of
good
works
to
do
for
what
else
are
here
the
hungry
thirsty
naked
imprisoned
sick
strangers
than
the
souls
of
your
own
children
with
whom
god
makes
of
your
house
a
hospital
and
sets
you
over
them
as
chief
nurse
to
wait
on
them
to
give
them
good
words
and
works
as
meat
and
drink
that
they
may
learn
to
trust
believe
and
fear
god
and
to
place
their
hope
on
him
to
honor
his
name
not
to
swear
nor
curse
to
mortify
themselves
by
praying
fasting
watching
working
to
attend
worship
and
to
hear
god
word
and
to
keep
the
sabbath
that
they
may
learn
to
despise
temporal
things
to
bear
misfortune
calmly
and
not
to
fear
death
nor
to
love
this
life
see
what
great
lessons
are
these
how
many
good
works
you
have
before
you
in
your
home
with
your
child
that
needs
all
these
things
like
a
hungry
thirsty
naked
poor
imprisoned
sick
soul
o
what
a
blessed
marriage
and
home
were
that
where
such
parents
were
to
be
found
truly
it
would
be
a
real
church
a
chosen
cloister
yea
a
paradise
of
such
says
psalm
cxxviii
blessed
are
they
that
fear
god
and
walk
in
his
commandments
thou
shalt
eat
of
the
labor
of
thine
hands
therefore
thou
shalt
be
happy
and
it
shall
be
well
with
thee
thy
wife
shall
be
as
a
fruitful
vine
in
thine
house
and
thy
children
shall
be
as
the
young
scions
of
laden
olive
trees
about
thy
table
behold
thus
shall
the
man
be
blessed
that
feareth
the
lord
etc
where
are
such
parents
where
are
they
that
ask
after
good
works
here
none
wishes
to
come
why
god
has
commanded
it
the
devil
flesh
and
blood
pull
away
from
it
it
makes
no
show
therefore
it
counts
for
nothing
here
this
husband
runs
to
james
that
wife
vows
a
pilgrimage
to
our
lady
no
one
vows
that
he
will
properly
govern
and
teach
himself
and
his
child
to
the
honor
of
god
he
leaves
behind
those
whom
god
has
commanded
him
to
keep
in
body
and
soul
and
would
serve
god
in
some
other
place
which
has
not
been
commanded
him
such
perversity
no
bishop
forbids
no
preacher
corrects
nay
for
covetousness
sake
they
confirm
it
and
daily
only
invent
more
pilgrimages
elevations
of
saints
god
have
pity
on
such
blindness
vi
on
the
other
hand
parents
can
not
earn
eternal
punishment
in
any
way
more
easily
than
by
neglecting
their
own
children
in
their
own
home
and
not
teaching
them
the
things
which
have
been
spoken
of
above
of
what
help
is
it
that
they
kill
themselves
with
fasting
praying
making
pilgrimages
and
do
all
manner
of
good
works
god
will
after
all
not
ask
them
about
these
things
at
their
death
and
in
the
day
of
judgment
but
will
require
of
them
the
children
whom
he
entrusted
to
them
this
is
shown
by
that
word
of
christ
luke
xxiii
ye
daughters
of
jerusalem
weep
not
for
me
but
for
yourselves
and
for
your
children
the
days
are
coming
in
which
they
shall
say
blessed
are
the
wombs
that
never
bare
and
the
paps
which
never
gave
suck
why
shall
they
lament
except
because
all
their
condemnation
comes
from
their
own
children
if
they
had
not
had
children
perhaps
they
might
have
been
saved
truly
these
words
ought
to
open
the
eyes
of
parents
that
they
may
have
regard
to
the
souls
of
their
children
so
that
the
poor
children
be
not
deceived
by
their
false
fleshly
love
as
if
they
had
rightly
honored
their
parents
when
they
are
not
angry
with
them
or
are
obedient
in
worldly
matters
by
which
their
is
strengthened
although
the
commandment
places
the
parents
in
honor
for
the
very
purpose
that
the
of
the
children
may
be
broken
and
that
the
children
may
become
humble
and
meek
just
as
it
has
been
said
of
the
other
commandments
that
they
are
to
be
fulfilled
in
the
chief
work
so
here
too
let
no
one
suppose
that
the
training
and
teaching
of
his
children
is
sufficient
of
itself
except
it
be
done
in
confidence
of
divine
favor
so
that
a
man
doubt
not
that
he
is
wellpleasing
to
god
in
his
works
and
that
he
let
such
works
be
nothing
else
than
an
exhortation
and
exercise
of
his
faith
that
he
trust
god
and
look
to
him
for
blessings
and
a
gracious
will
without
which
faith
no
work
lives
or
is
good
and
acceptable
for
many
heathen
have
trained
their
children
beautifully
but
it
is
all
lost
because
of
their
unbelief
vii
the
second
work
of
this
commandment
is
to
honor
and
obey
the
spiritual
mother
the
holy
christian
church
the
spiritual
power
so
that
we
conform
to
what
she
commands
forbids
appoints
orders
binds
and
looses
and
honor
fear
and
love
the
spiritual
authority
as
we
honor
love
and
fear
our
natural
parents
and
yield
to
it
in
all
things
which
are
not
contrary
to
the
first
three
commandments
now
with
regard
to
this
work
things
are
almost
worse
than
with
regard
to
the
first
the
spiritual
authority
should
punish
sin
with
the
ban
and
with
laws
and
constrain
its
spiritual
children
to
be
good
in
order
that
they
might
have
reason
to
do
this
work
and
to
exercise
themselves
in
obeying
and
honoring
it
such
zeal
one
does
not
see
now
they
act
toward
their
subjects
like
the
mothers
who
forsake
their
children
and
run
after
their
lovers
as
hosea
ii
says
they
do
not
preach
they
do
not
teach
they
do
not
hinder
they
do
not
punish
and
there
is
no
spiritual
government
at
all
left
in
christendom
what
can
i
say
of
this
work
a
few
and
are
left
and
these
had
better
be
done
away
with
but
no
one
gives
this
a
thought
and
there
is
nothing
left
except
the
ban
for
debt
and
this
should
not
be
but
spiritual
authority
should
look
to
it
that
adultery
unchastity
usury
gluttony
worldly
show
excessive
adornment
and
such
like
open
sin
and
shame
might
be
most
severely
punished
and
corrected
and
they
should
properly
manage
the
endowments
monastic
houses
parishes
and
schools
and
earnestly
maintain
worship
in
them
provide
for
the
young
people
boys
and
girls
in
schools
and
cloisters
with
learned
pious
men
as
teachers
that
they
might
all
be
well
trained
and
so
the
older
people
give
a
good
example
and
christendom
be
filled
and
adorned
with
fine
young
people
so
paul
teaches
his
disciple
titus
that
he
should
rightly
instruct
and
govern
all
classes
young
and
old
men
and
women
but
now
he
goes
to
school
who
wishes
he
is
taught
who
governs
and
teaches
himself
nay
it
has
alas
come
to
such
a
pass
that
the
places
where
good
should
be
taught
have
become
schools
of
knavery
and
no
one
at
all
takes
thought
for
the
wild
youth
viii
if
the
above
order
prevailed
one
could
say
how
honor
and
obedience
should
be
given
to
the
spiritual
authority
but
now
the
case
is
like
that
of
the
natural
parents
who
let
their
children
do
as
they
please
at
present
the
spiritual
authority
threatens
dispenses
takes
money
and
pardons
more
than
it
has
power
to
pardon
i
will
here
refrain
from
saying
more
we
see
more
of
it
than
is
good
greed
holds
the
reins
and
just
what
should
be
forbidden
is
taught
and
it
is
clearly
seen
that
the
spiritual
estate
is
in
all
things
more
worldly
than
the
worldly
estate
itself
meanwhile
christendom
must
be
ruined
and
this
commandment
perish
if
there
were
a
bishop
who
would
zealously
provide
for
all
these
classes
supervise
make
visitations
and
be
faithful
as
he
ought
truly
one
city
would
be
too
much
for
him
for
in
the
time
of
the
apostles
when
christendom
was
at
its
best
estate
each
city
had
a
bishop
although
the
smallest
part
of
the
inhabitants
were
christians
how
may
things
go
when
one
bishop
wants
to
have
so
much
another
so
much
this
one
the
whole
world
that
one
the
fourth
of
it
it
is
time
that
we
pray
god
for
mercy
of
spiritual
power
we
have
much
but
of
spiritual
government
nothing
or
little
meanwhile
may
he
help
who
can
that
endowments
monastic
houses
parishes
and
schools
be
well
established
and
managed
and
it
would
also
be
one
of
the
works
of
the
spiritual
authority
that
it
lessen
the
number
of
endowments
monastic
houses
and
schools
where
they
can
not
be
cared
for
it
is
much
better
that
there
be
no
monastic
house
or
endowment
than
that
there
be
evil
government
in
them
whereby
god
is
the
more
provoked
to
anger
ix
since
then
the
authorities
so
entirely
neglect
their
work
and
are
perverted
it
must
assuredly
follow
that
they
misuse
their
power
and
undertake
other
and
evil
works
just
as
parents
do
when
they
give
some
command
contrary
to
god
here
we
must
be
wise
for
the
apostle
has
said
that
those
times
shall
be
perilous
in
which
such
authorities
shall
rule
for
it
seems
as
if
we
resisted
their
power
if
we
do
not
do
and
leave
undone
all
that
they
prescribe
therefore
we
must
take
hold
of
the
first
three
commandments
and
the
first
table
and
be
certain
that
no
man
neither
bishop
nor
pope
nor
angel
may
command
or
determine
anything
that
is
contrary
to
or
hinders
these
three
commandments
or
does
not
help
them
and
if
they
attempt
such
things
it
is
not
valid
and
amounts
to
nothing
and
we
also
sin
if
we
follow
and
obey
or
even
tolerate
such
acts
from
this
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
commands
of
fasting
do
not
include
the
sick
the
pregnant
women
or
those
who
for
other
reasons
can
not
fast
without
injury
and
to
rise
higher
in
our
time
nothing
comes
from
rome
but
a
fair
of
spiritual
wares
which
are
openly
and
shamelessly
bought
and
sold
indulgences
parishes
monastic
houses
bishoprics
provostships
benefices
and
every
thing
that
has
ever
been
founded
to
god
service
far
and
wide
whereby
not
only
is
all
money
and
wealth
of
the
world
drawn
and
driven
to
rome
for
this
would
be
the
smallest
harm
but
the
parishes
bishoprics
and
prelacies
are
torn
to
pieces
deserted
laid
waste
and
so
the
people
are
neglected
word
and
god
name
and
honor
come
to
naught
and
faith
is
destroyed
so
that
at
last
such
institutions
and
offices
fall
into
the
hands
not
only
of
unlearned
and
unfit
men
but
the
greater
part
into
the
hands
of
the
romans
the
greatest
villains
in
the
world
thus
what
has
been
founded
for
god
service
for
the
instruction
government
and
improvement
of
the
people
must
now
serve
the
yea
not
to
use
plainer
language
roman
whores
and
knaves
yet
we
have
no
more
thanks
than
that
they
mock
us
for
it
as
fools
x
if
then
such
unbearable
abuses
are
all
carried
on
in
the
name
of
god
and
peter
just
as
if
god
name
and
the
spiritual
power
were
instituted
to
blaspheme
god
honor
to
destroy
christendom
body
and
soul
we
are
indeed
in
duty
bound
to
resist
in
a
proper
way
as
much
as
we
can
and
here
we
must
do
like
pious
children
whose
parents
have
become
insane
and
first
see
by
what
right
that
which
has
been
founded
for
god
service
in
our
lands
or
has
been
ordained
to
provide
for
our
children
must
be
allowed
to
do
its
work
in
rome
and
to
lapse
here
where
it
ought
to
serve
how
can
we
be
so
foolish
since
then
bishops
and
spiritual
prelates
stand
idle
in
this
matter
offer
no
opposition
or
are
afraid
and
thus
allow
christendom
to
perish
it
is
our
duty
first
of
all
humbly
to
call
upon
god
for
help
to
prevent
this
thing
then
to
put
our
hand
to
work
to
the
same
end
send
the
courtesans
and
those
who
bear
letters
from
rome
about
their
business
in
a
reasonable
gentle
way
inform
them
that
if
they
wish
to
care
for
their
parishes
properly
they
shall
live
in
them
and
improve
the
people
by
preaching
or
by
good
example
or
if
not
and
they
do
live
in
rome
or
elsewhere
lay
waste
and
debauch
the
churches
then
let
the
pope
feed
them
whom
they
serve
it
is
not
fitting
that
we
support
the
pope
servants
his
people
yes
his
knaves
and
whores
to
the
destruction
and
injury
of
our
souls
lo
these
are
the
true
turks
whom
the
kings
princes
and
the
nobility
ought
to
attack
first
not
seeking
thereby
their
own
benefit
but
only
the
improvement
of
christendom
and
the
prevention
of
the
blasphemy
and
disgracing
of
the
divine
name
and
so
to
deal
with
the
clergy
as
with
a
father
who
has
lost
his
sense
and
wits
who
if
one
did
not
restrain
him
and
resist
him
although
with
all
humility
and
honor
might
destroy
child
heir
and
everybody
thus
we
are
to
honor
roman
authority
as
our
highest
father
and
yet
since
they
have
gone
mad
and
lost
their
senses
not
allow
them
to
do
what
they
attempt
lest
christendom
be
destroyed
thereby
xi
some
think
this
should
be
referred
to
a
general
council
to
this
i
say
no
for
we
have
had
many
councils
in
which
this
has
been
proposed
namely
at
constance
basel
and
the
last
roman
council
but
nothing
has
been
accomplished
and
things
have
grown
ever
worse
moreover
such
councils
are
entirely
useless
since
roman
wisdom
has
contrived
the
device
that
the
kings
and
princes
must
beforehand
take
an
oath
to
let
the
romans
remain
what
they
are
and
keep
what
they
have
and
so
has
put
up
a
bar
to
ward
off
all
reformation
to
retain
protection
and
liberty
for
all
their
knavery
although
this
oath
is
demanded
forced
and
taken
contrary
to
god
and
the
law
and
by
it
the
doors
are
locked
against
the
holy
spirit
who
should
rule
the
councils
but
this
would
be
the
best
and
also
the
only
remedy
remaining
if
kings
princes
nobility
cities
and
communities
themselves
began
and
opened
a
way
for
reformation
so
that
the
bishops
and
clergy
who
now
are
afraid
would
have
reason
to
follow
for
here
nothing
else
shall
and
must
be
considered
except
first
three
commandments
against
which
neither
rome
nor
heaven
nor
earth
can
command
or
forbid
anything
and
the
ban
or
threatening
with
which
they
think
they
can
prevent
this
amounts
to
nothing
just
as
it
amounts
to
nothing
if
an
insane
father
severely
threatens
the
son
who
restrains
him
or
locks
him
up
xii
the
third
work
of
this
commandment
is
to
obey
the
temporal
authority
as
paul
teaches
romans
xiii
and
titus
iii
and
peter
peter
ii
submit
yourselves
to
the
king
as
supreme
and
to
the
princes
as
his
ambassadors
and
to
all
the
ordinances
of
the
worldly
power
but
it
is
the
work
of
the
temporal
power
to
protect
its
subjects
and
to
punish
thievery
robbery
and
adultery
as
paul
says
romans
xiii
it
beareth
not
the
sword
in
vain
it
serves
god
with
it
to
the
terror
of
evil
doers
and
to
the
protection
of
the
good
here
men
sin
in
two
ways
first
if
they
lie
to
the
government
deceive
it
and
are
disloyal
neither
obey
nor
do
as
it
has
ordered
and
commanded
whether
with
their
bodies
or
their
possessions
for
even
if
the
government
does
injustice
as
the
king
of
babylon
did
to
the
people
of
israel
yet
god
would
have
it
obeyed
without
treachery
and
deception
secondly
when
men
speak
evil
of
the
government
and
curse
it
and
when
a
man
can
not
revenge
himself
and
abuses
the
government
with
grumbling
and
evil
words
publicly
or
secretly
in
all
this
we
are
to
regard
that
which
peter
bids
us
regard
namely
that
its
power
whether
it
do
right
or
wrong
can
not
harm
the
soul
but
only
the
body
and
property
unless
indeed
it
should
try
openly
to
compel
us
to
do
wrong
against
god
or
men
as
in
former
days
when
the
magistrates
were
not
yet
christians
and
as
the
turk
is
now
said
to
do
for
to
suffer
wrong
destroys
no
one
soul
nay
it
improves
the
soul
although
it
inflicts
loss
upon
the
body
and
property
but
to
do
wrong
that
destroys
the
soul
although
it
should
gain
all
the
world
wealth
xiii
this
also
is
the
reason
why
there
is
not
such
great
danger
in
the
temporal
power
as
in
the
spiritual
when
it
does
wrong
for
the
temporal
power
can
do
no
harm
i
since
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
preaching
and
faith
and
the
first
three
commandments
but
the
spiritual
power
does
harm
not
only
when
it
does
wrong
but
also
when
it
neglects
its
duty
and
busies
itself
with
other
things
even
if
they
were
better
than
the
very
best
works
of
the
temporal
power
therefore
we
must
resist
it
when
it
does
not
do
right
and
not
resist
the
temporal
power
although
it
does
wrong
for
the
poor
people
believe
and
do
as
they
see
the
spiritual
power
believing
and
doing
if
they
are
not
set
an
example
and
are
not
taught
then
they
also
believe
nothing
and
do
nothing
since
this
power
is
instituted
for
no
other
reason
than
to
lead
the
people
in
faith
to
god
all
this
is
not
found
in
the
temporal
power
for
it
may
do
and
leave
undone
what
it
will
my
faith
to
god
still
goes
its
way
and
works
its
works
because
i
need
not
believe
what
it
believes
therefore
also
the
temporal
power
is
a
very
small
thing
in
sight
and
far
too
slightly
regarded
by
him
that
for
its
sake
whether
it
do
right
or
wrong
we
should
resist
become
disobedient
and
quarrel
on
the
other
hand
the
spiritual
power
is
an
exceeding
great
blessing
and
far
too
precious
in
his
eyes
that
the
very
least
of
christians
should
endure
and
keep
silent
if
it
departs
a
hair
breadth
from
its
own
duty
not
to
say
when
it
does
the
very
opposite
of
its
duty
as
we
now
see
it
do
every
day
xiv
in
this
power
also
there
is
much
abuse
first
when
it
follows
the
flatterers
which
is
a
common
and
especially
harmful
plague
of
this
power
against
which
no
one
can
sufficiently
guard
and
protect
himself
here
it
is
led
by
the
nose
and
oppresses
the
common
people
becomes
a
government
of
the
like
of
which
a
heathen
says
the
catch
the
small
flies
but
the
roll
through
so
the
laws
ordinances
and
government
of
one
and
the
same
authority
hold
the
small
men
and
the
great
are
free
and
where
the
prince
is
not
himself
so
wise
that
he
needs
nobody
advice
or
has
such
a
standing
that
they
fear
him
there
will
and
must
be
unless
god
should
do
a
special
wonder
a
childish
government
for
this
reason
god
has
considered
evil
unfit
rulers
the
greatest
of
plagues
as
he
threatens
isaiah
iii
i
will
take
away
from
them
every
man
of
valor
and
will
give
children
to
be
their
princes
and
babes
to
rule
over
them
four
plagues
god
has
named
in
scripture
ezekiel
xiv
the
first
and
slightest
which
also
david
chose
is
pestilence
the
second
is
famine
the
third
is
war
the
fourth
is
all
manner
of
evil
beasts
such
as
lions
wolves
serpents
dragons
these
are
the
wicked
rulers
for
where
these
are
the
land
is
destroyed
not
only
in
body
and
property
as
in
the
others
but
also
in
honor
discipline
virtue
and
the
soul
salvation
for
pestilence
and
famine
make
people
good
and
rich
but
war
and
wicked
rulers
bring
to
naught
everything
that
has
to
do
with
temporal
and
eternal
possessions
xv
a
prince
must
also
be
very
wise
and
not
at
all
times
undertake
to
enforce
his
own
will
although
he
may
have
the
authority
and
the
very
best
cause
for
it
is
a
far
nobler
virtue
to
endure
wrong
to
authority
than
to
risk
property
and
person
if
it
is
advantageous
to
the
subjects
since
worldly
rights
attach
only
to
temporal
goods
hence
it
is
a
very
foolish
saying
i
have
a
right
to
it
therefore
i
will
take
it
by
storm
and
keep
it
although
all
sorts
of
misfortune
may
come
to
others
thereby
so
we
read
of
the
emperor
octavianus
that
he
did
not
wish
to
make
war
however
just
his
cause
might
be
unless
there
were
sure
indications
of
greater
benefit
than
harm
or
at
least
that
the
harm
would
not
be
intolerable
and
said
war
is
like
fishing
with
a
golden
net
the
loss
risked
is
always
greater
than
the
catch
can
be
for
he
who
guides
a
wagon
must
walk
far
otherwise
than
if
he
were
walking
alone
when
alone
he
may
walk
jump
and
do
as
he
will
but
when
he
drives
he
must
so
guide
and
adapt
himself
that
the
wagon
and
horses
can
follow
him
and
regard
that
more
than
his
own
will
so
also
a
prince
leads
a
multitude
with
him
and
must
not
walk
and
act
as
he
wills
but
as
the
multitude
can
considering
their
need
and
advantage
more
than
his
will
and
pleasure
for
when
a
prince
rules
after
his
own
mad
will
and
follows
his
own
opinion
he
is
like
a
mad
driver
who
rushes
straight
ahead
with
horse
and
wagon
through
bushes
thorns
ditches
water
up
hill
and
down
dale
regardless
of
roads
and
bridges
he
will
not
drive
long
all
will
go
to
smash
therefore
it
would
be
most
profitable
for
rulers
that
they
read
or
have
read
to
them
from
youth
on
the
histories
both
in
sacred
and
in
profane
books
in
which
they
would
find
more
examples
and
skill
in
ruling
than
in
all
the
books
of
law
as
we
read
that
the
kings
of
persia
did
esther
vi
for
examples
and
histories
benefit
and
teach
more
than
the
laws
and
statutes
there
actual
experience
teaches
here
untried
and
uncertain
words
xvi
three
special
distinct
works
all
rulers
might
do
in
our
times
particularly
in
our
lands
first
to
make
an
end
of
the
horrible
gluttony
and
drunkenness
not
only
because
of
the
excess
but
also
because
of
its
expense
for
through
seasonings
and
spices
and
the
like
without
which
men
could
well
live
no
little
loss
of
temporal
wealth
has
come
and
daily
is
coming
upon
our
lands
to
prevent
these
two
great
evils
would
truly
give
the
temporal
power
enough
to
do
for
the
inroads
they
have
made
are
wide
and
deep
and
how
could
those
in
power
serve
god
better
and
thereby
also
improve
their
own
land
secondly
to
forbid
the
excessive
cost
of
clothing
whereby
so
much
wealth
is
wasted
and
yet
only
the
world
and
the
flesh
are
served
it
is
fearful
to
think
that
such
abuse
is
to
be
found
among
the
people
who
have
been
pledged
baptised
and
consecrated
to
christ
the
crucified
and
who
should
bear
the
cross
after
him
and
prepare
for
the
life
to
come
by
dying
daily
if
some
men
erred
through
ignorance
it
might
be
borne
but
that
it
is
practised
so
freely
without
punishment
without
shame
without
hindrance
nay
that
praise
and
fame
are
sought
thereby
this
is
indeed
an
unchristian
thing
thirdly
to
drive
out
the
usurious
buying
of
which
in
the
whole
world
ruins
consumes
and
troubles
all
lands
peoples
and
cities
through
its
cunning
form
by
which
it
appears
not
to
be
usury
while
in
truth
it
is
worse
than
usury
because
men
are
not
on
their
guard
against
it
as
against
open
usury
see
these
are
the
three
jews
as
men
say
who
suck
the
whole
world
dry
here
princes
ought
not
to
sleep
nor
be
lazy
if
they
would
give
a
good
account
of
their
office
to
god
xvii
here
too
ought
to
be
mentioned
the
knavery
which
is
practised
by
officiales
and
other
episcopal
and
spiritual
officers
who
ban
load
hunt
and
drive
the
poor
people
with
great
burdens
as
long
as
a
penny
remains
this
ought
to
be
prevented
by
the
temporal
sword
since
there
is
no
other
help
or
remedy
o
would
god
in
heaven
that
some
time
a
government
might
be
established
that
would
do
away
with
the
public
as
was
done
among
the
people
of
israel
it
is
indeed
an
unchristian
sight
that
public
houses
of
sin
are
maintained
among
christians
a
thing
formerly
altogether
unheard
of
it
should
be
a
rule
that
boys
and
girls
should
be
married
early
and
such
vice
be
prevented
such
a
rule
and
custom
ought
to
be
sought
for
by
both
the
spiritual
and
the
temporal
power
if
it
was
possible
among
the
jews
why
should
it
not
also
be
possible
among
christians
nay
if
it
is
possible
in
villages
towns
and
some
cities
as
we
all
see
why
should
it
not
be
possible
everywhere
but
the
trouble
is
there
is
no
real
government
in
the
world
no
one
wants
to
work
therefore
the
mechanics
must
give
their
workmen
holiday
then
they
are
free
and
no
one
can
tame
them
but
if
there
were
a
rule
that
they
must
do
as
they
are
bid
and
no
one
would
give
them
work
in
other
places
this
evil
would
to
a
large
extent
be
mended
god
help
us
i
fear
that
here
the
wish
is
far
greater
than
the
hope
but
this
does
not
excuse
us
now
see
here
only
a
few
works
of
magistrates
are
indicated
but
they
are
so
good
and
so
many
that
they
have
superabundant
good
works
to
do
every
hour
and
could
constantly
serve
god
but
these
works
like
the
others
should
also
be
done
in
faith
yea
be
an
exercise
of
faith
so
that
no
one
expect
to
please
god
by
the
works
but
by
confident
trust
in
his
favor
do
such
works
only
to
the
honor
and
praise
of
his
gracious
god
thereby
to
serve
and
benefit
his
neighbor
xviii
the
fourth
work
of
this
commandment
is
obedience
of
servants
and
workmen
toward
their
lords
and
ladies
masters
and
mistresses
of
this
paul
says
titus
ii
thou
shalt
exhort
servants
that
they
highly
honor
their
masters
be
obedient
do
what
pleases
them
not
cheating
them
nor
opposing
them
for
this
reason
also
because
they
thereby
bring
the
doctrine
of
christ
and
our
faith
into
good
repute
that
the
heathen
can
not
complain
of
us
and
be
offended
peter
also
says
servants
be
subject
to
your
masters
for
the
fear
of
god
not
only
to
the
good
and
gentle
but
also
to
the
froward
and
harsh
for
this
is
acceptable
with
god
if
a
man
suffers
harshness
being
innocent
now
there
is
the
greatest
complaint
in
the
world
about
servants
and
working
men
that
they
are
disobedient
unfaithful
unmannerly
and
this
is
a
plague
sent
of
god
and
truly
this
is
the
one
work
of
servants
whereby
they
may
be
saved
truly
they
need
not
make
pilgrimages
or
do
this
thing
or
the
other
they
have
enough
to
do
if
their
heart
is
only
set
on
this
that
they
gladly
do
and
leave
undone
what
they
know
pleases
their
masters
and
mistresses
and
all
this
in
a
simple
faith
not
that
they
would
by
their
works
gain
much
merit
but
that
they
do
it
all
in
the
confidence
of
divine
favor
in
which
all
merits
are
to
be
found
purely
for
nothing
out
of
the
love
and
toward
god
which
grows
out
of
such
confidence
and
all
such
works
they
should
think
of
as
an
exercise
and
exhortation
ever
to
strengthen
their
faith
and
confidence
more
and
more
for
as
has
now
been
frequently
said
this
faith
makes
all
works
good
yea
it
must
do
them
and
be
the
xix
on
the
other
hand
the
masters
and
mistresses
should
not
rule
their
servants
maids
and
workingmen
roughly
not
look
to
all
things
too
closely
occasionally
overlook
something
and
for
peace
sake
make
allowances
for
it
is
not
possible
that
everything
be
done
perfectly
at
all
times
among
any
class
of
men
as
long
as
we
live
on
earth
in
imperfection
of
this
paul
says
colossians
iv
masters
do
unto
your
servants
that
which
is
just
and
equal
knowing
that
ye
also
have
a
master
in
heaven
therefore
as
the
masters
do
not
wish
god
to
deal
too
sharply
with
them
but
that
many
things
be
overlooked
through
grace
they
also
should
be
so
much
the
more
gentle
toward
their
servants
and
overlook
some
things
and
yet
have
a
care
that
the
servants
do
right
and
learn
to
fear
god
but
see
now
what
good
works
a
householder
and
a
mistress
can
do
how
finely
god
offers
us
all
good
works
so
near
at
hand
so
manifold
so
continuously
that
we
have
no
need
of
asking
after
good
works
and
might
well
forget
the
other
showy
invented
works
of
men
such
as
making
pilgrimages
building
churches
seeking
indulgence
and
the
like
here
i
ought
naturally
also
to
say
how
a
wife
ought
to
be
obedient
subject
to
her
husband
as
to
her
superior
give
way
to
him
keep
silent
and
give
up
to
him
where
it
is
a
matter
not
contrary
to
commands
on
the
other
hand
the
husband
should
love
his
wife
overlook
a
little
and
not
deal
strictly
with
her
of
which
matter
peter
and
paul
have
said
much
but
this
has
its
place
in
the
further
explanation
of
the
ten
commandments
and
is
easily
inferred
from
these
passages
xx
but
all
that
has
been
said
of
these
works
is
included
in
these
two
obedience
and
considerateness
obedience
is
the
duty
of
subjects
considerateness
that
of
masters
that
they
take
care
to
rule
their
subjects
well
deal
kindly
with
them
and
do
everything
whereby
they
may
benefit
and
help
them
that
is
their
way
to
heaven
and
these
are
the
best
works
they
can
do
on
earth
with
these
they
are
more
acceptable
to
god
than
if
without
these
they
did
nothing
but
miracles
so
says
paul
romans
xii
he
that
ruleth
let
him
do
it
with
diligence
as
who
should
say
let
him
not
allow
himself
to
be
led
astray
by
what
other
people
or
classes
of
people
do
let
him
not
look
to
this
work
or
to
that
whether
it
be
splendid
or
obscure
but
let
him
look
to
his
own
position
and
think
only
how
he
may
benefit
those
who
are
subject
to
him
by
this
let
him
stand
nor
let
himself
be
torn
from
it
although
heaven
stood
open
before
him
nor
be
driven
from
it
although
hell
were
chasing
him
this
is
the
right
road
that
leads
him
to
heaven
oh
if
a
man
were
so
to
regard
himself
and
his
position
and
attended
to
its
duties
alone
how
rich
in
good
works
would
he
be
in
a
short
time
so
quietly
and
secretly
that
no
one
would
notice
it
except
god
alone
but
now
we
let
all
this
go
and
one
runs
to
the
carthusians
another
to
this
place
a
third
to
that
just
as
if
good
works
and
commandments
had
been
thrown
into
corners
and
hidden
although
it
is
written
in
proverbs
i
that
divine
wisdom
crieth
out
her
commandments
publicly
in
the
streets
in
the
midst
of
the
people
and
in
the
gates
of
the
cities
which
means
that
they
are
present
in
profusion
in
all
places
in
all
stations
of
life
and
at
all
times
and
we
do
not
see
them
but
in
our
blindness
look
for
them
elsewhere
this
christ
declared
matthew
xxiv
if
they
shall
say
unto
you
lo
here
is
christ
or
there
believe
it
not
if
they
shall
say
behold
he
is
in
the
desert
go
not
forth
behold
he
is
in
the
secret
chambers
believe
it
not
they
are
false
prophets
and
false
christs
xxi
again
obedience
is
the
duty
of
subjects
that
they
direct
all
their
diligence
and
effort
to
do
and
to
leave
undone
what
their
desire
of
them
that
they
do
not
allow
themselves
to
be
torn
or
driven
from
this
whatever
another
do
let
no
man
think
that
he
lives
well
or
does
good
works
whether
it
be
prayer
or
fasting
or
by
whatever
name
it
may
be
called
if
he
does
not
earnestly
and
diligently
exercise
himself
in
this
but
if
it
should
happen
as
it
often
does
that
the
temporal
power
and
authorities
as
they
are
called
should
urge
a
subject
to
do
contrary
to
the
commandments
of
god
or
hinder
him
from
doing
them
there
obedience
ends
and
that
duty
is
annulled
here
a
man
must
say
as
peter
says
to
the
rulers
of
the
jews
we
ought
to
obey
god
rather
than
men
he
did
not
say
we
must
not
obey
men
for
that
would
be
wrong
but
he
said
god
rather
than
men
thus
if
a
prince
desired
to
go
to
war
and
his
cause
was
manifestly
unrighteous
we
should
not
follow
nor
help
him
at
all
since
god
has
commanded
that
we
shall
not
kill
our
neighbor
nor
do
him
injustice
likewise
if
he
bade
us
bear
false
witness
steal
lie
or
deceive
and
the
like
here
we
ought
rather
give
up
goods
honor
body
and
life
that
god
commandments
may
stand
the
four
preceding
commandments
have
their
works
in
the
understanding
that
is
they
take
a
man
captive
rule
him
and
make
him
subject
so
that
he
rule
not
himself
approve
not
himself
think
not
highly
of
himself
but
in
humility
know
himself
and
allow
himself
to
be
led
that
pride
be
prevented
the
following
commandments
deal
with
the
passions
and
lust
of
men
that
these
also
be
killed
i
the
passions
of
anger
and
revenge
of
which
the
fifth
commandment
says
thou
shalt
not
kill
this
commandment
has
one
work
which
however
includes
many
and
dispels
many
vices
and
is
called
meekness
now
this
is
of
two
kinds
the
one
has
a
beautiful
splendor
and
there
is
nothing
back
of
it
this
we
practice
toward
our
friends
and
those
who
do
us
good
and
give
us
pleasure
with
goods
honor
and
favor
or
who
do
not
offend
us
with
words
nor
with
deeds
such
meekness
irrational
animals
have
lions
and
snakes
jews
turks
knaves
murderers
bad
women
these
are
all
content
and
gentle
when
men
do
what
they
want
or
let
them
alone
and
yet
there
are
not
a
few
who
deceived
by
such
worthless
meekness
cover
over
their
anger
and
excuse
it
saying
i
would
indeed
not
be
angry
if
i
were
left
alone
certainly
my
good
man
so
the
evil
spirit
also
would
be
meek
if
he
had
his
own
way
dissatisfaction
and
resentment
overwhelm
you
in
order
that
they
may
show
you
how
full
of
anger
and
wickedness
you
are
that
you
may
be
admonished
to
strive
after
meekness
and
to
drive
out
anger
the
second
form
of
meekness
is
good
through
and
through
that
which
is
shown
toward
opponents
and
enemies
does
them
no
harm
does
not
revenge
itself
does
not
curse
nor
revile
does
not
speak
evil
of
them
does
not
meditate
evil
against
them
although
they
had
taken
away
goods
honor
life
friends
and
everything
nay
where
it
is
possible
it
returns
good
for
evil
speaks
well
of
them
thinks
well
of
them
prays
for
them
of
this
christ
says
matthew
v
do
good
to
them
that
despitefully
use
you
pray
for
them
that
persecute
you
and
revile
you
and
paul
romans
xii
bless
them
which
curse
you
and
by
no
means
curse
them
but
do
good
to
them
ii
behold
how
this
precious
excellent
work
has
been
lost
among
christians
so
that
nothing
now
everywhere
prevails
except
strife
war
quarreling
anger
hatred
envy
cursing
slandering
injuring
vengeance
and
all
manner
of
angry
works
and
words
and
yet
with
all
this
we
have
our
many
holidays
hear
masses
say
our
prayers
establish
churches
and
more
such
spiritual
finery
which
god
has
not
commanded
we
shine
resplendently
and
excessively
as
if
we
were
the
most
holy
christians
there
ever
were
and
so
because
of
these
mirrors
and
masks
we
allow
god
commandment
to
go
to
complete
ruin
and
no
one
considers
or
examines
himself
how
near
or
how
far
he
be
from
meekness
and
the
fulfilment
of
this
commandment
although
god
has
said
that
not
he
who
does
such
works
but
he
who
keeps
his
commandments
shall
enter
into
eternal
life
now
since
no
one
lives
on
earth
upon
whom
god
does
not
bestow
an
enemy
and
opponent
as
a
proof
of
his
own
anger
and
wickedness
that
is
one
who
afflicts
him
in
goods
honor
body
or
friends
and
thereby
tries
whether
anger
is
still
present
whether
he
can
be
toward
his
enemy
speak
well
of
him
do
good
to
him
and
not
intend
any
evil
against
him
let
him
come
forward
who
asks
what
he
shall
do
that
he
may
do
good
works
please
god
and
be
saved
let
him
set
his
enemy
before
him
keep
him
constantly
before
the
eyes
of
his
heart
as
an
exercise
whereby
he
may
curb
his
spirit
and
train
his
heart
to
think
kindly
of
his
enemy
wish
him
well
care
for
him
and
pray
for
him
and
then
when
opportunity
offers
speak
well
of
him
and
do
good
to
him
let
him
who
will
try
this
and
if
he
find
not
enough
to
do
all
his
life
long
he
may
convict
me
of
lying
and
say
that
my
contention
was
wrong
but
if
this
is
what
god
desires
and
if
he
will
be
paid
in
no
other
coin
of
what
avail
is
it
that
we
busy
ourselves
with
other
great
works
which
are
not
commanded
and
neglect
this
therefore
god
says
matthew
v
i
say
unto
you
that
whosoever
is
angry
with
his
neighbor
is
in
danger
of
the
judgment
but
whosoever
shall
say
to
his
brother
thou
fool
that
is
all
manner
of
invective
cursing
reviling
slandering
he
shall
be
in
danger
of
everlasting
fire
what
remains
then
for
the
outward
act
striking
wounding
killing
injuring
if
the
thoughts
and
words
of
anger
are
so
severely
condemned
iii
but
where
there
is
true
meekness
there
the
heart
is
pained
at
every
evil
which
happens
to
one
enemy
and
these
are
the
true
children
and
heirs
of
god
and
brethren
of
christ
whose
heart
was
so
pained
for
us
all
when
he
died
on
the
holy
cross
even
so
we
see
a
pious
judge
passing
sentence
upon
the
criminal
with
sorrow
and
regretting
the
death
which
the
law
imposes
here
the
act
seems
to
be
one
of
anger
and
harshness
so
thoroughly
good
is
meekness
that
even
in
such
works
of
anger
it
remains
nay
it
torments
the
heart
most
sorely
when
it
must
be
angry
and
severe
but
here
we
must
watch
that
we
be
not
meek
contrary
to
god
honor
and
commandment
for
it
is
written
of
moses
that
he
was
the
very
meekest
man
on
earth
and
yet
when
the
jews
had
worshiped
the
golden
calf
and
provoked
god
to
anger
he
put
many
of
them
to
death
and
thereby
made
atonement
before
god
likewise
it
is
not
fitting
that
the
magistrates
should
be
idle
and
allow
sin
to
have
sway
and
that
we
say
nothing
my
own
possessions
my
honor
my
injury
i
must
not
regard
nor
grow
angry
because
of
them
but
god
honor
and
commandment
we
must
protect
and
injury
or
injustice
to
our
neighbor
we
must
prevent
the
magistrates
with
the
sword
the
rest
of
us
with
reproof
and
rebuke
yet
always
with
pity
for
those
who
have
merited
the
punishment
this
high
noble
sweet
work
can
easily
be
learned
if
we
perform
it
in
faith
and
as
an
exercise
of
faith
for
if
faith
does
not
doubt
the
favor
of
god
nor
question
that
god
is
gracious
it
will
become
quite
easy
for
a
man
to
be
gracious
and
favorable
to
his
neighbor
however
much
he
may
have
sinned
for
we
have
sinned
much
more
against
god
behold
a
short
commandment
this
but
it
presents
a
long
mighty
exercise
of
good
works
and
of
faith
thou
shalt
not
commit
adultery
in
this
commandment
too
a
good
work
is
commanded
which
includes
much
and
drives
away
much
vice
it
is
called
purity
or
chastity
of
which
much
is
written
and
preached
and
it
is
well
known
to
every
one
only
that
it
is
not
as
carefully
observed
and
practised
as
other
works
which
are
not
commanded
so
ready
are
we
to
do
what
is
not
commanded
and
to
leave
undone
what
is
commanded
we
see
that
the
world
is
full
of
shameful
works
of
unchastity
indecent
words
tales
and
ditties
temptation
to
which
is
daily
increased
through
gluttony
and
drunkenness
idleness
and
frippery
yet
we
go
our
way
as
if
we
were
christians
when
we
have
been
to
church
have
said
our
little
prayer
have
observed
the
fasts
and
feasts
then
we
think
our
whole
duty
is
done
now
if
no
other
work
were
commanded
but
chastity
alone
we
would
all
have
enough
to
do
with
this
one
so
perilous
and
raging
a
vice
is
unchastity
it
rages
in
all
our
members
in
the
thoughts
of
our
hearts
in
the
seeing
of
our
eyes
in
the
hearing
of
our
ears
in
the
words
of
our
mouth
in
the
works
of
our
hands
and
feet
and
all
our
body
to
control
all
these
requires
labor
and
effort
and
thus
the
commandments
of
god
teach
us
how
great
truly
good
works
are
nay
that
it
is
impossible
for
us
of
our
own
strength
to
conceive
a
good
work
to
say
nothing
of
attempting
or
doing
it
augustine
says
that
among
all
the
conflicts
of
the
christian
the
conflict
of
chastity
is
the
hardest
for
the
one
reason
alone
that
it
continues
daily
without
ceasing
and
chastity
seldom
prevails
this
all
the
saints
have
wept
over
and
lamented
as
paul
does
romans
vii
i
find
in
me
that
is
in
my
flesh
no
good
thing
ii
if
this
work
of
chastity
is
to
be
permanent
it
will
drive
to
many
other
good
works
to
fasting
and
temperance
over
against
gluttony
and
drunkenness
to
watching
and
early
rising
over
against
laziness
and
excessive
sleep
to
work
and
labor
over
against
idleness
for
gluttony
drunkenness
lying
late
abed
loafing
and
being
without
work
are
weapons
of
unchastity
with
which
chastity
is
quickly
overcome
on
the
other
hand
the
holy
apostle
paul
calls
fasting
watching
and
labor
godly
weapons
with
which
unchastity
is
mastered
but
as
has
been
said
above
these
exercises
must
do
no
more
than
overcome
unchastity
and
not
pervert
nature
above
all
this
the
strongest
defence
is
prayer
and
the
word
of
god
namely
that
when
evil
lust
stirs
a
man
flee
to
prayer
call
upon
god
mercy
and
help
read
and
meditate
on
the
gospel
and
in
it
consider
christ
sufferings
thus
says
psalm
cxxxvii
happy
shall
he
be
that
taketh
and
dasheth
the
little
ones
of
babylon
against
the
rock
that
is
if
the
heart
runs
to
the
lord
christ
with
its
evil
thoughts
while
they
are
yet
young
and
just
beginning
for
christ
is
a
rock
on
which
they
are
ground
to
powder
and
come
to
naught
see
here
each
one
will
find
enough
to
do
with
himself
and
more
than
enough
and
will
be
given
many
good
works
to
do
within
himself
but
now
no
one
uses
prayer
fasting
watching
labor
for
this
purpose
but
men
stop
in
these
works
as
if
they
were
in
themselves
the
whole
purpose
although
they
should
be
arranged
so
as
to
fulfil
the
work
of
this
commandment
and
purify
us
daily
more
and
more
some
have
also
indicated
more
things
which
should
be
avoided
such
as
soft
beds
and
clothes
that
we
should
avoid
excessive
adornment
and
neither
associate
nor
talk
with
members
of
the
opposite
sex
nor
even
look
upon
them
and
whatsoever
else
may
be
conducive
to
chastity
in
all
these
things
no
one
can
fix
a
definite
rule
and
measure
each
one
must
watch
himself
and
see
what
things
are
needful
to
him
for
chastity
in
what
quantity
and
how
long
they
help
him
to
be
chaste
that
he
may
thus
choose
and
observe
them
for
himself
if
he
can
not
do
this
let
him
for
a
time
give
himself
up
to
be
controlled
by
another
who
may
hold
him
to
such
observance
until
he
can
learn
to
rule
himself
this
was
the
purpose
for
which
the
monastic
houses
were
established
of
old
to
teach
young
people
discipline
and
purity
iii
in
this
work
a
good
strong
faith
is
a
great
help
more
noticeably
so
than
in
almost
any
other
so
that
for
this
reason
also
isaiah
xi
says
that
faith
is
a
girdle
of
the
reins
that
is
a
guard
of
chastity
for
he
who
so
lives
that
he
looks
to
god
for
all
grace
takes
pleasure
in
spiritual
purity
therefore
he
can
so
much
more
easily
resist
fleshly
impurity
and
in
such
faith
the
spirit
tells
him
of
a
certainty
how
he
shall
avoid
evil
thoughts
and
everything
that
is
repugnant
to
chastity
for
as
the
faith
in
divine
favor
lives
without
ceasing
and
works
in
all
works
so
it
also
does
not
cease
its
admonitions
in
all
things
that
are
pleasing
to
god
or
displease
him
as
john
says
in
his
epistle
ye
need
not
that
any
man
teach
you
for
the
divine
anointing
that
is
the
spirit
of
god
teacheth
you
of
all
things
yet
we
must
not
despair
if
we
are
not
soon
rid
of
the
temptation
nor
by
any
means
imagine
that
we
are
free
from
it
as
long
as
we
live
and
we
must
regard
it
only
as
an
incentive
and
admonition
to
prayer
fasting
watching
laboring
and
to
other
exercises
for
the
quenching
of
the
flesh
especially
to
the
practice
and
exercise
of
faith
in
god
for
that
chastity
is
not
precious
which
is
at
ease
but
that
which
is
at
war
with
unchastity
and
fights
and
without
ceasing
drives
out
all
the
poison
with
which
the
flesh
and
the
evil
spirit
attack
it
thus
peter
says
i
beseech
you
abstain
from
fleshly
desires
and
lusts
which
war
always
against
the
soul
and
paul
romans
vi
ye
shall
not
obey
the
body
in
its
lusts
in
these
and
like
passages
it
is
shown
that
no
one
is
without
evil
lust
but
that
everyone
shall
and
must
daily
fight
against
it
but
although
this
brings
uneasiness
and
pain
it
is
none
the
less
a
work
that
gives
pleasure
in
which
we
shall
have
our
comfort
and
satisfaction
for
they
who
think
they
make
an
end
of
temptation
by
yielding
to
it
only
set
themselves
on
fire
the
more
and
although
for
a
time
it
is
quiet
it
comes
again
with
more
strength
another
time
and
finds
the
nature
weaker
than
before
thou
shalt
not
steal
this
commandment
also
has
a
work
which
embraces
very
many
good
works
and
is
opposed
to
many
vices
and
is
called
in
german
mildigkeit
benevolence
which
is
a
work
ready
to
help
and
serve
every
one
with
one
goods
and
it
fights
not
only
against
theft
and
robbery
but
against
all
stinting
in
temporal
goods
which
men
may
practise
toward
one
another
such
as
greed
usury
overcharging
and
plating
wares
that
sell
as
solid
counterfeit
wares
short
measures
and
weights
and
who
could
tell
all
the
ready
novel
clever
tricks
which
multiply
daily
in
every
trade
by
which
every
one
seeks
his
own
gain
through
the
loss
and
forgets
the
rule
which
says
what
ye
wish
that
others
do
to
you
that
do
ye
also
to
them
if
every
one
kept
this
rule
before
his
eyes
in
his
trade
business
and
dealings
with
his
neighbor
he
would
readily
find
how
he
ought
to
buy
and
sell
take
and
give
lend
and
give
for
nothing
promise
and
keep
his
promise
and
the
like
and
when
we
consider
the
world
in
its
doings
how
greed
controls
all
business
we
would
not
only
find
enough
to
do
if
we
would
make
an
honorable
living
before
god
but
also
be
overcome
with
dread
and
fear
for
this
perilous
miserable
life
which
is
so
exceedingly
overburdened
entangled
and
taken
captive
with
cares
of
this
temporal
life
and
dishonest
seeking
of
gain
ii
therefore
the
wise
man
says
not
in
vain
happy
is
the
rich
man
who
is
found
without
blemish
who
does
not
run
after
gold
and
has
not
set
his
confidence
in
the
treasures
of
money
who
is
he
we
will
praise
him
that
he
has
done
wondrous
things
in
his
life
as
if
he
would
say
none
such
is
found
or
very
few
indeed
yea
they
are
very
few
who
notice
and
recognise
such
lust
for
gold
in
themselves
for
greed
has
here
a
very
beautiful
fine
cover
for
its
shame
which
is
called
provision
for
the
body
and
natural
need
under
cover
of
which
it
accumulates
wealth
beyond
all
limits
and
is
never
satisfied
so
that
he
who
would
in
this
matter
keep
himself
clean
must
truly
as
he
says
do
miracles
or
wondrous
things
in
his
life
now
see
if
a
man
wish
not
only
to
do
good
works
but
even
miracles
which
god
may
praise
and
be
pleased
with
what
need
has
he
to
look
elsewhere
let
him
take
heed
to
himself
and
see
to
it
that
he
run
not
after
gold
nor
set
his
trust
on
money
but
let
the
gold
run
after
him
and
money
wait
on
his
favor
and
let
him
love
none
of
these
things
nor
set
his
heart
on
them
then
he
is
the
true
generous
wonderworking
happy
man
as
job
xxxi
says
i
have
never
yet
relied
upon
gold
and
never
yet
made
gold
my
hope
and
confidence
and
psalm
lxii
if
riches
increase
set
not
your
heart
upon
them
so
christ
also
teaches
matthew
vi
that
we
shall
take
no
thought
what
we
shall
eat
and
drink
and
wherewithal
we
shall
be
clothed
since
god
cares
for
this
and
knows
that
we
have
need
of
all
these
things
but
some
say
yes
rely
upon
that
take
no
thought
and
see
whether
a
roasted
chicken
will
fly
into
your
mouth
i
do
not
say
that
a
man
shall
not
labor
and
seek
a
living
but
he
shall
not
worry
not
be
greedy
not
despair
thinking
that
he
will
not
have
enough
for
in
adam
we
are
all
condemned
to
labor
when
god
says
to
him
genesis
iii
in
the
sweat
of
thy
face
shalt
thou
eat
bread
and
job
v
as
the
birds
to
flying
so
is
man
born
unto
labor
now
the
birds
fly
without
worry
and
greed
and
so
we
also
should
labor
without
worry
and
greed
but
if
you
do
worry
and
are
greedy
wishing
that
the
roasted
chicken
fly
into
your
mouth
worry
and
be
greedy
and
see
whether
you
will
thereby
fulfil
god
commandment
and
be
saved
iii
this
work
faith
teaches
of
itself
for
if
the
heart
looks
for
divine
favor
and
relies
upon
it
how
is
it
possible
that
a
man
should
be
greedy
and
worry
he
must
be
sure
beyond
a
doubt
that
god
cares
for
him
therefore
he
does
not
cling
to
money
he
uses
it
also
with
cheerful
liberality
for
the
benefit
of
his
neighbor
and
knows
well
that
he
will
have
enough
however
much
he
may
give
away
for
his
god
whom
he
trusts
will
not
lie
to
him
nor
forsake
him
as
it
is
written
psalm
xxxvii
i
have
been
young
and
now
am
old
never
have
i
seen
a
believing
man
who
trusts
god
that
is
a
righteous
man
forsaken
or
his
child
begging
bread
therefore
the
apostle
calls
no
other
sin
idolatry
except
covetousness
because
this
sin
shows
most
plainly
that
it
does
not
trust
god
for
anything
expects
more
good
from
its
money
than
from
god
and
as
has
been
said
it
is
by
such
confidence
that
god
is
truly
honored
or
dishonored
and
indeed
in
this
commandment
it
can
be
clearly
seen
how
all
good
works
must
be
done
in
faith
for
here
every
one
most
surely
feels
that
the
cause
of
covetousness
is
distrust
and
the
cause
of
liberality
is
faith
for
because
a
man
trusts
god
he
is
generous
and
does
not
doubt
that
he
will
always
have
enough
on
the
other
hand
a
man
is
covetous
and
worries
because
he
does
not
trust
god
now
as
in
this
commandment
faith
is
the
and
the
doer
of
the
good
work
of
liberality
so
it
is
also
in
all
the
other
commandments
and
without
such
faith
liberality
is
of
no
worth
but
rather
a
careless
squandering
of
money
iv
by
this
we
are
also
to
know
that
this
liberality
shall
extend
even
to
enemies
and
opponents
for
what
manner
of
good
deed
is
that
if
we
are
liberal
only
to
our
friends
as
christ
teaches
luke
vi
even
a
wicked
man
does
that
to
another
who
is
his
friend
besides
the
brute
beasts
also
do
good
and
are
generous
to
their
kind
therefore
a
christian
must
rise
higher
let
his
liberality
serve
also
the
undeserving
enemies
and
the
ungrateful
even
as
his
heavenly
father
makes
his
sun
to
rise
on
good
and
evil
and
the
rain
to
fall
on
the
grateful
and
ungrateful
but
here
it
will
be
found
how
hard
it
is
to
do
good
works
according
to
god
commandment
how
nature
squirms
twists
and
writhes
in
its
opposition
to
it
although
it
does
the
good
works
of
its
own
choice
easily
and
gladly
therefore
take
your
enemies
the
ungrateful
and
do
good
to
them
then
you
will
find
how
near
you
are
to
this
commandment
or
how
far
from
it
and
how
all
your
life
you
will
always
have
to
do
with
the
practice
of
this
work
for
if
your
enemy
needs
you
and
you
do
not
help
him
when
you
can
it
is
just
the
same
as
if
you
had
stolen
what
belonged
to
him
for
you
owed
it
to
him
to
help
him
so
says
ambrose
feed
the
hungry
if
you
do
not
feed
him
you
have
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
slain
him
and
in
this
commandment
are
included
the
works
of
mercy
which
christ
will
require
at
men
hands
at
the
last
day
but
the
magistrates
and
cities
ought
to
see
to
it
that
the
vagabonds
pilgrims
and
mendicants
from
foreign
lands
be
debarred
or
at
least
allowed
only
under
restrictions
and
rules
so
that
knaves
be
not
permitted
to
run
at
large
under
the
guise
of
mendicants
and
their
knavery
of
which
there
now
is
much
be
prohibited
i
have
spoken
at
greater
length
of
this
commandment
in
the
treatise
on
usury
thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbor
this
commandment
seems
small
and
yet
is
so
great
that
he
who
would
rightly
keep
it
must
risk
and
imperil
life
and
limb
goods
and
honor
friends
and
all
that
he
has
and
yet
it
includes
no
more
than
the
work
of
that
small
member
the
tongue
and
is
called
in
german
wahrheit
sagen
telling
the
truth
and
where
there
is
need
gainsaying
lies
so
that
it
forbids
many
evil
works
of
the
tongue
first
those
which
are
committed
by
speaking
and
those
which
are
committed
by
keeping
silent
by
speaking
when
a
man
has
an
unjust
and
wants
to
prove
and
maintain
his
case
by
a
false
argument
catch
his
neighbor
with
subtilty
produce
everything
that
strengthens
and
furthers
his
own
cause
and
withhold
and
discount
everything
that
furthers
his
neighbor
good
cause
in
doing
which
he
does
not
do
to
his
neighbor
as
he
would
have
his
neighbor
do
to
him
this
some
men
do
for
the
sake
of
gain
some
to
avoid
loss
or
shame
thereby
seeking
their
own
advantage
more
than
god
commandment
and
excuse
themselves
by
saying
vigilanti
jura
subveniunt
the
law
helps
him
who
watches
just
as
if
it
were
not
as
much
their
duty
to
watch
for
their
neighbor
cause
as
for
their
own
thus
they
intentionally
allow
their
neighbor
cause
to
be
lost
although
they
know
that
it
is
just
this
evil
is
at
present
so
common
that
i
fear
no
court
is
held
and
no
suit
tried
but
that
one
side
sins
against
this
commandment
and
even
when
they
can
not
accomplish
it
they
yet
have
the
unrighteous
spirit
and
will
so
that
they
would
wish
the
neighbor
just
cause
to
be
lost
and
their
unjust
cause
to
prosper
this
sin
is
most
frequent
when
the
opponent
is
a
prominent
man
or
an
enemy
for
a
man
wants
to
revenge
himself
on
his
enemy
but
the
ill
will
of
a
man
of
prominence
he
does
not
wish
to
bring
upon
himself
and
then
begins
the
flattering
and
fawning
or
on
the
other
hand
the
withholding
of
the
truth
here
no
one
is
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
disfavor
and
displeasure
loss
and
danger
for
the
truth
sake
and
so
god
commandment
must
perish
and
this
is
almost
universally
the
way
of
the
world
he
who
would
keep
this
commandment
would
have
both
hands
full
doing
only
those
good
works
which
concern
the
tongue
and
then
how
many
are
there
who
allow
themselves
to
be
silenced
and
swerved
aside
from
the
truth
by
presents
and
gifts
so
that
in
all
places
it
is
truly
a
high
great
rare
work
not
to
be
a
false
witness
against
neighbor
ii
there
is
a
second
bearing
of
witness
to
the
truth
which
is
still
greater
with
which
we
must
fight
against
the
evil
spirits
and
this
concerns
not
temporal
matters
but
the
gospel
and
the
truth
of
faith
which
the
evil
spirit
has
at
no
time
been
able
to
endure
and
always
so
manages
that
the
great
among
men
whom
it
is
hard
to
resist
must
oppose
and
persecute
it
of
which
it
is
written
in
psalm
lxxxii
rid
the
poor
out
of
the
hand
of
the
wicked
and
help
the
forsaken
to
maintain
his
just
cause
such
persecution
it
is
true
has
now
become
infrequent
but
that
is
the
fault
of
the
spiritual
prelates
who
do
not
stir
up
the
gospel
but
let
it
perish
and
so
have
abandoned
the
very
thing
because
of
which
such
witnessing
and
persecution
should
arise
and
in
its
place
they
teach
us
their
own
law
and
what
pleases
them
for
this
reason
the
devil
also
does
not
stir
since
by
vanquishing
the
gospel
he
has
also
vanquished
faith
in
christ
and
everything
goes
as
he
wishes
but
if
the
gospel
should
be
stirred
up
and
be
heard
again
without
doubt
the
whole
world
would
be
aroused
and
moved
and
the
greater
portion
of
the
kings
princes
bishops
doctors
and
clergy
and
all
that
is
great
would
oppose
it
and
rage
against
it
as
has
always
happened
when
the
word
of
god
has
come
to
light
for
the
world
can
not
endure
what
comes
from
god
this
is
proved
in
christ
who
was
and
is
the
very
greatest
and
most
precious
and
best
of
all
that
god
has
yet
the
world
not
only
did
not
receive
him
but
persecuted
him
more
cruelly
than
all
others
who
had
ever
come
forth
from
god
therefore
as
at
that
time
so
at
all
times
there
are
few
who
stand
by
the
divine
truth
and
imperil
and
risk
life
and
limb
goods
and
honor
and
all
that
they
have
as
christ
has
foretold
ye
shall
be
hated
of
all
men
for
my
name
sake
and
many
of
them
shall
be
offended
in
me
yea
if
this
truth
were
attacked
by
peasants
herdsmen
and
men
of
no
standing
who
would
not
be
willing
and
able
to
confess
it
and
to
bear
witness
to
it
but
when
the
pope
and
the
bishops
together
with
princes
and
kings
attack
it
all
men
flee
keep
silent
dissemble
in
order
that
they
may
not
lose
goods
honor
favor
and
life
iii
why
do
they
do
this
because
they
have
no
faith
in
god
and
expect
nothing
good
from
him
for
where
such
faith
and
confidence
are
there
is
also
a
bold
defiant
fearless
heart
that
ventures
and
stands
by
the
truth
though
it
cost
life
or
cloak
though
it
be
against
pope
or
kings
as
we
see
that
the
martyrs
did
for
such
a
heart
is
satisfied
and
rests
easy
because
it
has
a
gracious
loving
god
therefore
it
despises
all
the
favor
grace
goods
and
honor
of
men
lets
them
come
and
go
as
they
please
as
is
written
in
psalm
xv
he
contemneth
them
that
contemn
god
and
honoreth
them
that
fear
the
lord
that
is
the
tyrants
the
mighty
who
persecute
the
truth
and
despise
god
he
does
not
fear
he
does
not
regard
them
he
despiseth
them
on
the
other
hand
those
who
are
persecuted
for
the
truth
sake
and
fear
god
more
than
men
to
these
he
clings
these
he
defends
these
he
honors
let
it
vex
whom
it
may
as
it
is
written
of
moses
hebrews
xi
that
he
stood
by
his
brethren
regardless
of
the
mighty
king
of
egypt
lo
in
this
commandment
again
you
see
briefly
that
faith
must
be
the
in
this
work
also
so
that
without
it
no
one
has
courage
to
do
this
work
so
entirely
are
all
works
comprised
in
faith
as
has
now
been
often
said
therefore
apart
from
faith
all
works
are
dead
however
good
the
form
and
name
they
bear
for
as
no
one
does
the
work
of
this
commandment
except
he
be
firm
and
fearless
in
the
confidence
of
divine
favor
so
also
he
does
no
work
of
any
other
commandment
without
the
same
faith
thus
every
one
may
easily
by
this
commandment
test
and
weigh
himself
whether
he
be
a
christian
and
truly
believe
in
christ
and
thus
whether
he
is
doing
good
works
or
no
now
we
see
how
the
almighty
god
has
not
only
set
our
lord
jesus
christ
before
us
that
we
should
believe
in
him
with
such
confidence
but
also
holds
before
us
in
him
an
example
of
this
same
confidence
and
of
such
good
works
to
the
end
that
we
should
believe
in
him
follow
him
and
abide
in
him
forever
as
he
says
john
xiv
i
am
the
way
the
truth
and
the
life
the
way
in
which
we
follow
him
the
truth
that
we
believe
in
him
the
life
that
we
live
in
him
forever
from
all
this
it
is
now
manifest
that
all
other
works
which
are
not
commanded
are
perilous
and
easily
known
such
as
building
churches
beautifying
them
making
pilgrimages
and
all
that
is
written
at
so
great
length
in
the
canon
law
and
has
misled
and
burdened
the
world
and
ruined
it
made
uneasy
consciences
silenced
and
weakened
faith
and
has
not
said
how
a
man
although
he
neglect
all
else
has
enough
to
do
with
all
his
powers
to
keep
the
commandments
of
god
and
can
never
do
all
the
good
works
which
he
is
commanded
to
do
why
then
does
he
seek
others
which
are
neither
necessary
nor
commanded
and
neglect
those
that
are
necessary
and
commanded
the
last
two
commandments
which
forbid
evil
desires
of
the
body
for
pleasure
and
for
temporal
goods
are
clear
in
themselves
these
evil
desires
do
no
harm
to
our
neighbor
and
yet
they
continue
unto
the
grave
and
the
strife
in
us
against
them
endures
unto
death
therefore
these
two
commandments
are
drawn
together
by
paul
into
one
romans
vii
and
are
set
as
a
goal
unto
which
we
do
not
attain
and
only
in
our
thoughts
reach
after
until
death
for
no
one
has
ever
been
so
holy
that
he
felt
in
himself
no
evil
inclination
especially
when
occasion
and
temptation
were
offered
for
original
sin
is
born
in
us
by
nature
and
may
be
checked
but
not
entirely
uprooted
except
through
the
death
of
the
body
which
for
this
reason
is
profitable
and
a
thing
to
be
desired
to
this
may
god
help
us
amen
