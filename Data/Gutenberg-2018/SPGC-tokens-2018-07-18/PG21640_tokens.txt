prologue
nikola
the
manager
of
the
new
imperial
restaurant
on
the
thames
embankment
went
into
his
luxurious
private
office
and
shut
the
door
having
done
so
he
first
scratched
his
chin
reflectively
and
then
took
a
letter
from
the
drawer
in
which
it
had
reposed
for
more
than
two
months
and
perused
it
carefully
though
he
was
not
aware
of
it
this
was
the
thirtieth
time
he
had
read
it
since
breakfast
that
morning
and
yet
he
was
not
a
whit
nearer
understanding
it
than
he
had
been
at
the
beginning
he
turned
it
over
and
scrutinized
the
back
where
not
a
sign
of
writing
was
to
be
seen
he
held
it
up
to
the
window
as
if
he
might
hope
to
discover
something
from
the
but
there
was
nothing
in
either
of
these
places
of
a
nature
calculated
to
set
his
troubled
mind
at
rest
then
he
took
a
magnificent
repeater
watch
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
glanced
at
the
dial
the
hands
stood
at
seven
he
immediately
threw
the
letter
on
the
table
and
as
he
did
so
his
anxiety
found
relief
in
words
it
really
the
most
extraordinary
affair
i
ever
had
to
do
with
he
remarked
and
as
i
been
in
the
business
just
years
at
eleven
next
monday
morning
i
ought
to
know
something
about
it
i
only
hope
i
done
right
that
all
as
he
spoke
the
chief
bookkeeper
who
had
the
treble
advantage
of
being
tall
pretty
and
just
years
of
age
entered
the
room
she
noticed
the
open
letter
and
the
look
upon
her
chief
face
and
her
curiosity
was
proportionately
excited
you
seem
worried
mcpherson
she
said
tenderly
as
she
put
down
the
papers
she
had
brought
in
for
his
signature
you
have
just
hit
it
miss
he
answered
pushing
them
farther
on
to
the
table
i
am
worried
about
many
things
but
particularly
about
this
letter
he
handed
the
epistle
to
her
and
she
being
desirous
of
impressing
him
with
her
business
capabilities
read
it
with
ostentatious
care
but
it
was
noticeable
that
when
she
reached
the
signature
she
too
turned
back
to
the
beginning
and
then
deliberately
read
it
over
again
the
manager
rose
crossed
to
the
mantelpiece
and
rang
for
the
head
waiter
having
relieved
his
feelings
in
this
way
he
seated
himself
again
at
his
put
on
his
glasses
and
stared
at
his
companion
while
waiting
for
her
to
speak
it
very
funny
she
said
very
funny
indeed
it
the
most
extraordinary
communication
i
have
ever
received
he
replied
with
conviction
you
see
it
is
written
from
cuyaba
brazil
the
date
is
three
months
ago
to
a
day
now
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
find
out
where
and
what
cuyaba
is
he
made
this
confession
with
an
air
of
conscious
pride
and
having
done
so
laid
himself
back
in
his
chair
stuck
his
thumbs
into
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
and
looked
at
his
fair
subordinate
for
approval
nor
was
he
destined
to
be
disappointed
he
was
a
bachelor
in
possession
of
a
snug
income
and
she
besides
being
pretty
was
a
lady
with
a
keen
eye
to
the
main
chance
and
where
cuyaba
she
asked
humbly
cuyaba
he
replied
rolling
his
tongue
with
considerable
relish
round
his
unconscious
mispronunciation
of
the
name
is
a
town
almost
on
the
western
or
bolivian
border
of
brazil
it
is
of
moderate
size
is
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
river
cuyaba
and
is
considerably
connected
with
the
famous
brazilian
diamond
fields
and
does
the
writer
of
this
letter
live
there
i
can
not
say
he
writes
from
there
that
is
enough
for
us
and
he
orders
dinner
for
four
here
in
a
private
room
overlooking
the
river
three
months
ahead
punctually
at
eight
gives
you
a
list
of
the
things
he
wants
and
even
arranges
the
decoration
of
the
table
says
he
has
never
seen
either
of
his
three
friends
before
that
one
of
them
hails
from
here
she
consulted
the
letter
again
another
from
bloemfontein
while
the
third
resides
at
present
in
england
each
one
is
to
present
an
ordinary
visiting
card
with
a
red
dot
on
it
to
the
porter
in
the
hall
and
to
be
shown
to
the
room
at
once
i
understand
it
at
all
the
manager
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
said
deliberately
is
in
china
bloemfontein
is
in
south
africa
what
a
wonderful
man
you
are
to
be
sure
mcpherson
i
never
can
how
you
manage
to
carry
so
much
in
your
head
there
spoke
the
true
woman
and
it
was
a
move
in
the
right
direction
for
the
manager
was
susceptible
to
her
gentle
influence
as
she
had
occasion
to
know
at
this
juncture
the
head
waiter
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
took
up
a
position
just
inside
the
doorway
as
if
he
were
afraid
of
injuring
the
carpet
by
coming
farther
is
no
ready
williams
quite
ready
sir
the
wine
is
on
the
ice
and
cook
tells
me
he
be
ready
to
dish
punctual
to
the
moment
the
letter
says
electric
light
candles
with
red
shades
have
you
put
on
those
shades
i
got
this
morning
just
seen
it
done
this
very
minute
sir
and
let
me
see
there
was
one
other
thing
he
took
the
letter
from
the
chief
bookkeeper
hand
and
glanced
at
it
ah
yes
a
porcelain
saucer
and
a
small
jug
of
new
milk
upon
the
mantelpiece
an
extraordinary
request
but
has
it
been
attended
to
i
put
it
there
myself
sir
who
wait
jones
edmunds
brooks
and
tomkins
very
good
then
i
think
that
will
do
stay
you
had
better
tell
the
hall
porter
to
look
out
for
three
gentlemen
presenting
plain
visiting
cards
with
a
little
red
spot
on
them
let
brooks
wait
in
the
hall
and
when
they
arrive
tell
him
to
show
them
straight
up
to
the
room
it
shall
be
done
sir
the
head
waiter
left
the
room
and
the
manager
stretched
himself
in
his
chair
yawned
by
way
of
showing
his
importance
and
then
said
solemnly
i
do
believe
they
any
of
them
turn
up
but
if
they
do
this
nikola
whoever
he
may
be
wo
be
able
to
find
fault
with
my
arrangements
then
leaving
the
dusty
high
road
of
business
he
and
his
companion
wandered
in
the
shady
of
love
to
the
end
that
when
the
chief
bookkeeper
returned
to
her
own
department
she
had
forgotten
the
strange
dinner
party
about
to
take
place
upstairs
and
was
busily
engaged
upon
a
calculation
as
to
how
she
would
look
in
white
satin
and
orange
blossoms
and
that
settled
fell
to
wondering
whether
it
was
true
as
miss
joyce
a
subordinate
had
been
heard
to
declare
that
the
manager
had
once
shown
himself
partial
to
a
certain
widow
with
reputed
savings
and
a
share
in
an
extensive
egg
and
dairy
business
at
ten
minutes
to
eight
precisely
a
hansom
drew
up
at
the
steps
of
the
hotel
as
soon
as
it
stopped
an
undersized
gentleman
with
a
clean
shaven
countenance
a
canonical
corporation
and
bow
legs
dressed
in
a
decidedly
clerical
garb
alighted
he
paid
and
discharged
his
cabman
and
then
took
from
his
ticket
pocket
an
ordinary
white
visiting
card
which
he
presented
to
the
individual
who
had
opened
the
apron
the
latter
having
noted
the
red
spot
called
a
waiter
and
the
reverend
gentleman
was
immediately
escorted
upstairs
hardly
had
the
attendant
time
to
return
to
his
station
in
the
hall
before
a
second
cab
made
its
appearance
closely
followed
by
a
third
out
of
the
second
jumped
a
tall
active
man
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
he
was
dressed
in
evening
dress
of
the
latest
fashion
and
to
conceal
it
from
the
vulgar
gaze
wore
a
large
inverness
cape
of
heavy
texture
he
also
in
his
turn
handed
a
white
card
to
the
porter
and
having
done
so
proceeded
into
the
hall
followed
by
the
occupant
of
the
last
cab
who
had
closely
copied
his
example
this
individual
was
also
in
evening
dress
but
it
was
of
a
different
stamp
it
was
and
had
seen
much
use
the
wearer
too
was
taller
than
the
ordinary
run
of
men
while
it
was
noticeable
that
his
hair
was
and
that
his
face
was
deeply
pitted
with
smallpox
after
disposing
of
their
hats
and
coats
in
an
they
reached
room
no
where
they
found
the
gentleman
in
clerical
costume
pacing
impatiently
up
and
down
left
alone
the
tallest
of
the
trio
who
for
want
of
a
better
title
we
may
call
the
best
dressed
man
took
out
his
watch
and
having
glanced
at
it
looked
at
his
companions
gentlemen
he
said
with
a
slight
american
accent
it
is
three
minutes
to
eight
my
name
is
eastover
i
glad
to
hear
it
for
i
most
uncommonly
hungry
said
the
next
tallest
whom
i
have
already
described
as
being
so
marked
by
disease
my
name
is
prendergast
we
only
wait
for
our
friend
and
host
remarked
the
clerical
gentleman
as
if
he
felt
he
ought
to
take
a
share
in
the
conversation
and
then
as
an
afterthought
he
continued
my
name
is
baxter
they
shook
hands
all
round
with
marked
cordiality
seated
themselves
again
and
took
it
in
turns
to
examine
the
clock
have
you
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
our
host
before
asked
baxter
of
prendergast
never
replied
that
gentleman
with
a
shake
of
his
head
perhaps
eastover
has
been
more
fortunate
not
i
was
the
brief
rejoinder
i
had
to
do
with
him
off
and
on
for
longer
than
i
care
to
reckon
but
i
never
set
eyes
on
him
up
to
date
and
where
may
he
have
been
the
first
time
you
heard
from
him
in
nashville
tennessee
said
eastover
after
that
tahupapa
new
zealand
after
that
papeete
in
the
society
islands
then

then

mr
baxter
the

he
is
evidently
a
great
traveller
and
a
most
mysterious
person
he
is
more
than
that
said
eastover
with
conviction
he
is
late
for
dinner
prendergast
looked
at
his
watch
that
clock
is
two
minutes
fast
hark
there
goes
big
ben
eight
exactly
as
he
spoke
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
voice
announced
dr
nikola
the
three
men
sprang
to
their
feet
simultaneously
with
exclamations
of
astonishment
as
the
man
they
had
been
discussing
made
his
appearance
it
would
take
more
time
than
i
can
spare
the
subject
to
give
you
an
adequate
and
inclusive
description
of
the
person
who
entered
the
room
at
that
moment
in
stature
he
was
slightly
above
the
ordinary
his
shoulders
were
broad
his
limbs
perfectly
shaped
and
plainly
muscular
but
very
slim
his
head
which
was
magnificently
set
upon
his
shoulders
was
adorned
with
a
profusion
of
glossy
black
hair
his
face
was
destitute
of
beard
or
moustache
and
was
of
oval
shape
and
handsome
moulding
while
his
skin
was
of
a
dark
olive
hue
a
colour
which
harmonized
well
with
his
piercing
black
eyes
and
pearly
teeth
his
hands
and
feet
were
small
and
the
greatest
dandy
must
have
admitted
that
he
was
irreproachably
dressed
with
a
neatness
that
bordered
on
the
puritanical
in
age
he
might
have
been
anything
from
to
forty
in
reality
he
was
he
advanced
into
the
room
and
walked
with
hand
directly
across
to
where
eastover
was
standing
by
the
fireplace
eastover
i
feel
certain
he
said
fixing
his
glittering
eyes
upon
the
man
he
addressed
and
allowing
a
curious
smile
to
play
upon
his
face
that
is
my
name
nikola
the
other
answered
with
evident
surprise
but
how
on
earth
can
you
distinguish
me
from
your
other
guests
ah
it
would
surprise
you
if
you
knew
and
prendergast
and
baxter
this
is
delightful
i
hope
i
am
not
late
we
had
a
collision
in
the
channel
this
morning
and
i
was
almost
afraid
i
might
not
be
up
to
time
dinner
seems
ready
shall
we
sit
down
to
it
they
seated
themselves
and
the
meal
commenced
the
imperial
restaurant
has
earned
an
enviable
reputation
for
doing
things
well
and
the
dinner
that
night
did
not
in
any
way
detract
from
its
lustre
but
delightful
as
it
all
was
it
was
noticeable
that
the
three
guests
paid
more
attention
to
their
host
than
to
his
excellent
as
they
had
said
before
his
arrival
they
had
all
had
dealings
with
him
for
several
years
but
what
those
dealings
were
they
were
careful
not
to
describe
it
was
more
than
possible
that
they
hardly
liked
to
remember
them
themselves
when
coffee
had
been
served
and
the
servants
had
withdrawn
nikola
rose
from
the
table
and
went
across
to
the
massive
sideboard
on
it
stood
a
basket
of
very
curious
shape
and
workmanship
this
he
opened
and
as
he
did
so
to
the
astonishment
of
his
guests
an
enormous
cat
as
black
as
his
master
coat
leaped
out
on
to
the
floor
the
reason
for
the
saucer
and
jug
of
milk
became
evident
seating
himself
at
the
table
again
the
host
followed
the
example
of
his
guests
and
lit
a
cigar
blowing
a
cloud
of
smoke
luxuriously
through
his
delicately
chiselled
nostrils
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
cornice
of
the
room
took
in
the
pictures
and
decorations
and
then
came
down
to
meet
the
faces
of
his
companions
as
they
did
so
the
black
cat
having
finished
its
meal
sprang
on
to
his
shoulder
to
crouch
there
watching
the
three
men
through
the
curling
smoke
drift
with
its
green
blinking
fiendish
eyes
nikola
smiled
as
he
noticed
the
effect
the
animal
had
upon
his
guests
now
shall
we
get
to
business
he
said
briskly
the
others
almost
simultaneously
knocked
the
ashes
off
their
cigars
and
brought
themselves
to
attention
nikola
dainty
languid
manner
seemed
to
drop
from
him
like
a
cloak
his
eyes
brightened
and
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
clean
cut
as
chiselled
silver
you
are
doubtless
anxious
to
be
informed
why
i
summoned
you
from
all
parts
of
the
globe
to
meet
me
here
and
it
is
very
natural
you
should
be
but
then
from
what
you
know
of
me
you
should
not
be
surprised
at
anything
i
do
his
voice
dropped
back
into
its
old
tone
of
gentle
languor
he
drew
in
a
great
breath
of
smoke
and
then
sent
it
slowly
out
from
his
lips
again
his
eyes
were
half
closed
and
he
drummed
with
one
finger
on
the
table
edge
the
cat
looked
through
the
smoke
at
the
three
men
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
he
grew
every
moment
larger
and
more
ferocious
presently
his
owner
took
him
from
his
perch
and
seating
him
on
his
knee
fell
to
stroking
his
fur
from
head
to
tail
with
his
long
slim
fingers
it
was
as
if
he
were
drawing
inspiration
for
some
deadly
mischief
from
the
uncanny
beast
to
preface
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
let
me
tell
you
that
this
is
by
far
the
most
important
business
for
which
i
have
ever
required
your
help
three
slow
strokes
down
the
centre
of
the
back
and
one
round
each
ear
when
it
first
came
into
my
mind
i
was
at
a
loss
who
to
trust
in
the
matter
i
thought
of
vendon
but
i
found
vendon
was
dead
i
thought
of
brownlow
but
brownlow
was
no
longer
faithful
two
strokes
down
the
back
and
two
on
the
throat
then
bit
by
bit
i
remembered
you
i
was
in
brazil
at
the
time
so
i
sent
for
you
you
came
so
far
so
good
he
rose
and
crossed
over
to
the
fireplace
as
he
went
the
cat
crawled
back
to
its
original
position
on
his
shoulder
then
his
voice
changed
once
more
to
its
former
tone
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
very
much
about
it
but
from
what
i
do
tell
you
you
will
be
able
to
gather
a
great
deal
and
imagine
the
rest
to
begin
with
there
is
a
man
living
in
this
world
who
has
done
me
a
great
and
lasting
injury
what
that
injury
is
is
no
concern
of
yours
you
would
not
understand
if
i
told
you
so
we
leave
that
out
of
the
question
he
is
immensely
rich
his
cheque
for
would
be
honoured
by
his
bank
at
any
minute
obviously
he
is
a
power
he
has
had
reason
to
know
that
i
am
pitting
my
wits
against
his
and
he
flatters
himself
that
so
far
he
has
got
the
better
of
me
that
is
because
i
am
drawing
him
on
i
am
maturing
a
plan
which
will
make
him
a
poor
and
a
very
miserable
man
at
one
and
the
same
time
if
that
scheme
succeeds
and
i
am
satisfied
with
the
way
you
three
men
have
performed
the
parts
i
shall
call
on
you
to
play
in
it
i
shall
pay
to
each
of
you
the
sum
of
if
it
does
succeed
then
you
will
each
receive
a
thousand
and
your
expenses
do
you
follow
me
it
was
evident
from
their
faces
that
they
hung
upon
his
every
word
but
remember
i
demand
from
you
your
whole
and
entire
labour
while
you
are
serving
me
you
are
mine
body
and
soul
i
know
you
are
trustworthy
i
have
had
good
proof
that
you
are
pardon
the
expression
unscrupulous
and
i
flatter
myself
you
are
silent
what
is
more
i
shall
tell
you
nothing
beyond
what
is
necessary
for
the
carrying
out
of
my
scheme
so
that
you
could
not
betray
me
if
you
would
now
for
my
plans
he
sat
down
again
and
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket

perused
it

that

was
expected

go
eastover
rose
shook
hands
and
left
the
room
without
a
word
he
was
too
astonished
to
hesitate
or
to
say
anything

that

succeed
if

difficult
person

you

boy
mind
a
desire
for
travel
do
let
him

nikola
picked
up

dr

he
rang
the
bell
and
ordered

duty
discharged
he
placed
the
cat
back
in
its
prison
shut
the
lid
descended
with
the
basket
to
the

and
called
a
hansom
the
porter
inquired
to
what

he
should
order
the
cabman
to

nikola
did
not

six

in

round

as

perfectly
willing

to

ten
pounds
sterling
to
the
man
who
can
put
me
on
my
back
and
big
shame
to
me
if
i
were
not
so
strong
considering
the
free
life
i
led
why
i
was
doing
man
work
at
an
age
when
most
boys
are
wondering
when
they
going
to
be
taken
out
of
knickerbockers
i
been
half
round
the
world
before
i
was
fifteen
and
had
been
wrecked
twice
and
marooned
once
before
my
beard
showed
signs
of
sprouting
my
father
was
an
englishman
not
very
much
profit
to
himself
so
he
used
to
say
but
of
a
kindly
disposition
and
the
best
husband
to
my
mother
during
their
short
married
life
that
any
woman
could
possibly
have
desired
she
poor
soul
died
of
fever
in
the
philippines
the
year
i
was
born
and
he
went
to
the
bottom
in
the
schooner
of
a
degree
west
of
the
line
islands
within
six
months
of
her
decease
struck
the
tail
end
of
a
cyclone
it
was
thought
and
went
down
lock
stock
and
barrel
leaving
only
one
man
to
tell
the
tale
so
i
lost
father
and
mother
in
the
same
twelve
months
and
that
being
so
when
i
put
my
on
my
head
it
covered
as
far
as
i
knew
all
my
family
in
the
world
any
way
you
look
at
it
it
calculated
to
give
you
a
turn
at
fifteen
years
of
age
to
know
that
there
not
a
living
soul
on
the
face
of
god
globe
that
you
can
take
by
the
hand
and
call
relation
that
old
saying
about
blood
being
thicker
than
water
is
a
pretty
true
one
i
reckon
friends
may
be
kind
they
were
so
to
me
but
after
all
not
the
same
thing
nor
can
they
be
as
your
own
kith
and
kin
however
i
had
to
look
my
trouble
in
the
face
and
stand
up
to
it
as
a
man
should
and
i
suppose
this
kept
me
from
brooding
over
my
loss
as
much
as
i
should
otherwise
have
done
at
any
rate
ten
days
after
the
news
reached
me
i
had
shipped
aboard
the
trading
schooner
for
papeete
booked
for
five
years
among
the
islands
where
i
was
to
learn
to
water
copra
to
cook
my
balances
and
to
lay
the
foundation
of
the
strange
adventures
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
after
my
time
expired
and
i
had
served
my
trading
company
on
half
the
mudbanks
of
the
pacific
i
returned
to
australia
and
went
up
inside
the
great
barrier
reef
to
somerset
the
pearling
station
that
had
just
come
into
existence
on
cape
york
they
were
good
days
there
then
before
all
the
laws
that
now
regulate
the
pearling
trade
had
come
into
force
days
when
a
man
could
do
almost
as
he
liked
among
the
islands
in
those
seas
i
do
know
how
other
folk
liked
it
but
the
life
just
suited
me
so
much
so
that
when
somerset
proved
inconvenient
and
the
settlement
shifted
across
to
thursday
i
went
with
it
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
with
money
enough
at
my
back
to
fit
myself
out
with
a
lugger
and
full
crew
so
that
i
could
go
pearling
on
my
own
account
for
many
years
i
went
at
it
head
down
and
this
brings
me
up
to
four
years
ago
when
i
was
a
grown
man
the
owner
of
a
house
two
luggers
and
as
good
a
diving
plant
as
any
man
could
wish
to
possess
what
was
more
just
before
this
i
had
put
some
money
into
a
mining
concern
on
the
mainland
which
had
contrary
to
most
ventures
of
the
sort
turned
up
trumps
giving
me
as
my
share
the
nice
round
sum
of
with
all
this
wealth
at
my
back
and
having
been
in
harness
for
a
greater
number
of
years
on
end
than
i
cared
to
count
i
made
up
my
mind
to
take
a
holiday
and
go
home
to
england
to
see
the
place
where
my
father
was
born
and
had
lived
his
early
life
i
found
the
name
of
it
written
in
the
of
an
old
latin
book
he
left
me
and
to
have
a
look
at
a
country
i
heard
so
much
about
but
never
thought
to
set
my
foot
upon
accordingly
i
packed
my
traps
let
my
house
sold
my
luggers
and
gear
intending
to
buy
new
ones
when
i
returned
said
to
my
friends
and
shipmates
and
set
off
to
join
an
orient
liner
in
sydney
you
will
see
from
this
that
i
intended
doing
the
thing
in
style
and
why
not
got
more
money
to
my
hand
to
play
with
than
most
of
the
swells
who
patronize
the
first
saloon
i
had
earned
it
honestly
and
was
resolved
to
enjoy
myself
with
it
to
the
top
of
my
bent
i
reached
sydney
a
week
before
the
boat
was
advertised
to
sail
but
i
did
fret
much
about
that
there
plenty
to
see
and
do
in
such
a
big
place
and
when
a
man
been
shut
away
from
theatres
and
amusements
for
years
at
a
stretch
he
can
put
in
his
time
pretty
well
looking
about
him
all
the
same
not
knowing
a
soul
in
the
place
i
must
confess
there
were
moments
when
i
did
think
regretfully
of
the
little
island
hidden
away
up
north
under
the
wing
of
new
guinea
of
the
luggers
dancing
to
the
breeze
in
the
harbour
and
the
warm
welcome
that
always
awaited
me
among
my
friends
in
the
saloons
take
my
word
for
it
there
something
in
even
being
a
leader
on
a
small
island
anyway
it
better
than
being
a
deadbeat
in
a
big
city
like
sydney
where
nobody
knows
you
and
your
neighbour
would
miss
you
if
he
never
saw
or
heard
of
you
again
i
used
to
think
of
these
things
as
i
marched
about
the
streets
looking
in
at
shop
windows
or
took
excursions
up
and
down
the
harbour
no
place
like
sydney
harbour
in
the
wide
wide
world
for
beauty
and
before
i
been
there
a
week
i
was
familiar
with
every
part
of
it
still
it
would
have
been
enjoyable
as
i
hinted
just
now
if
i
had
had
a
friend
to
tour
about
with
me
and
by
the
same
token
i
doing
one
man
an
injustice
there
was
fellow
i
remember
who
did
offer
to
show
me
round
i
fell
across
him
in
a
saloon
in
george
street
he
was
tall
and
handsome
and
as
spic
and
span
as
a
new
pin
till
you
came
to
look
under
the
surface
when
he
entered
the
bar
he
winked
at
the
girl
who
was
serving
me
and
as
soon
as
i
finished
my
drink
asked
me
to
take
another
with
him
seeing
what
his
little
game
was
and
wanting
to
teach
him
a
lesson
i
lured
him
on
by
consenting
i
drank
with
him
and
then
he
drank
with
me
been
long
in
sydney
he
inquired
casually
as
he
stroked
his
fair
moustache
just
come
in
was
my
reply
do
you
find
it
dull
work
going
about
alone
he
inquired
i
shall
never
forget
my
first
week
of
it
you
about
right
i
answered
it
is
dull
i
do
know
a
soul
bar
my
banker
and
lawyer
dear
me
more
curling
of
the
moustache
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
while
you
here
i
hope
you
command
me
i
believe
we
both
englishmen
eh
it
very
good
of
you
i
replied
modestly
affecting
to
be
overcome
by
his
condescension
i
just
off
to
lunch
i
am
staying
at
the
is
it
far
enough
for
a
hansom
as
he
was
about
to
answer
a
lawyer
with
whom
i
had
done
a
little
business
the
day
before
walked
into
the
room
i
turned
to
my
patronising
friend
and
said
will
you
excuse
me
for
one
moment
i
want
to
speak
to
this
gentleman
he
was
still
all
graciousness
i
call
a
hansom
and
wait
for
you
in
it
when
he
had
left
the
saloon
i
spoke
to
the
new
arrival
he
had
noticed
the
man
i
had
been
talking
to
and
was
kind
enough
to
warn
me
against
him
that
man
he
said
bears
a
very
bad
reputation
he
makes
it
his
trade
to
meet
new
arrivals
from
england
young
pigeons
with
money
he
shows
them
round
sydney
and
plucks
them
so
clean
that
when
they
leave
his
hands
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
they
have
a
feather
left
to
fly
with
you
ought
not
with
your
experience
of
rough
customers
to
be
taken
in
by
him
nor
am
i
i
replied
i
am
going
to
teach
him
a
lesson
come
with
me
arm
in
arm
we
walked
into
the
street
watched
by
hawk
from
his
seat
in
the
cab
when
we
got
there
we
stood
for
a
moment
chatting
and
then
strolled
together
down
the
pavement
next
moment
i
heard
the
cab
coming
along
after
us
and
my
friend
hailing
me
in
his
silkiest
tones
but
though
i
looked
him
full
in
the
face
i
pretended
not
to
know
him
seeing
this
he
drove
past
us
pulled
up
a
little
farther
down
and
sprang
out
to
wait
for
me
i
was
almost
afraid
i
had
missed
you
he
began
as
we
came
up
with
him
perhaps
as
it
is
such
a
fine
day
you
would
rather
walk
than
ride
i
beg
your
pardon
i
answered
i
really
afraid
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
but
you
have
asked
me
to
lunch
with
you
at
the
you
told
me
to
call
a
hansom
pardon
me
again
but
you
are
really
mistaken
i
said
i
was
going
to
lunch
at
the
and
asked
you
if
it
was
far
enough
to
be
worth
while
taking
a
hansom
that
is
your
hansom
not
mine
if
you
require
it
any
longer
i
should
advise
you
to
pay
the
man
and
let
him
go
you
are
a
swindler
sir
i
refuse
to
pay
the
cabman
it
is
your
hansom
i
took
a
step
closer
to
my
fine
gentleman
and
looking
him
full
in
the
face
said
as
quietly
as
possible
for
i
did
want
all
the
street
to
hear
dodson
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
perhaps
you
think
twice
next
time
before
you
try
your
little
games
on
me
he
stepped
back
as
if
he
had
been
shot
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
jumped
into
his
cab
and
drove
off
in
the
opposite
direction
when
he
had
gone
i
looked
at
my
astonished
companion
well
now
he
ejaculated
at
last
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
that
very
easily
i
replied
i
happened
to
remember
having
met
that
gentleman
up
in
our
part
of
the
world
when
he
was
in
a
very
awkward
position
very
awkward
by
his
action
just
now
i
should
say
that
he
has
not
forgotten
the
circumstance
any
more
than
i
have
that
was
the
first
of
the
only
two
adventures
of
any
importance
i
met
with
during
my
stay
in
new
south
wales
and
there
not
much
in
that
i
fancy
i
can
hear
you
saying
well
that
may
be
so
i
do
deny
it
but
it
was
nevertheless
through
that
that
i
became
mixed
up
with
the
folk
who
figure
in
this
book
and
indeed
it
was
to
that
very
circumstance
and
that
alone
i
owe
my
connection
with
the
queer
story
i
have
set
myself
to
tell
and
this
is
how
it
came
about
three
days
before
the
steamer
sailed
and
about
four
in
the
afternoon
i
chanced
to
be
walking
down
castlereagh
street
wondering
what
on
earth
i
should
do
with
myself
until
when
i
saw
approaching
me
the
very
man
whose
discomfiture
i
have
just
described
being
probably
occupied
planning
the
plucking
of
some
unfortunate
new
chum
he
did
not
see
me
and
as
i
had
no
desire
to
meet
him
again
after
what
had
passed
between
us
i
crossed
the
road
and
meandered
off
in
a
different
direction
eventually
finding
myself
located
on
a
seat
in
the
domain
lighting
a
cigarette
and
looking
down
over
a
broad
expanse
of
harbour
one
thought
led
to
another
and
so
i
sat
on
and
on
long
after
dusk
had
fallen
never
stirring
until
a
circumstance
occurred
on
a
neighbouring
path
that
attracted
my
attention
a
young
and
lady
was
pursuing
her
way
in
my
direction
evidently
intending
to
leave
the
park
by
the
entrance
i
had
used
to
come
into
it
but
unfortunately
for
her
at
the
junction
of
two
paths
to
my
right
three
of
sydney
typical
larrikins
were
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
they
had
observed
the
girl
coming
towards
them
and
were
evidently
preparing
some
plan
for
accosting
her
when
she
was
only
about
fifty
yards
away
two
of
them
walked
to
a
distance
leaving
the
third
and
biggest
ruffian
to
waylay
her
he
did
so
but
without
success
she
passed
him
and
continued
her
walk
at
increased
speed
the
man
thereupon
quickened
his
pace
and
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
he
was
unobserved
again
accosted
her
again
she
tried
to
escape
him
but
this
time
he
would
not
leave
her
what
was
worse
his
two
friends
were
now
blocking
the
path
in
front
she
looked
to
right
and
left
and
was
evidently
uncertain
what
to
do
then
seeing
escape
was
hopeless
she
stopped
took
out
her
purse
and
gave
it
to
the
man
who
had
first
spoken
to
her
thinking
this
was
going
too
far
i
jumped
up
and
went
quickly
across
the
turf
towards
them
my
footsteps
made
no
sound
on
the
soft
grass
and
as
they
were
too
much
occupied
in
examining
what
she
had
given
them
they
did
not
notice
my
approach
you
scoundrels
i
said
when
i
had
come
up
with
them
what
do
you
mean
by
stopping
this
lady
let
her
go
instantly
and
you
my
friend
just
hand
over
that
purse
the
man
addressed
looked
at
me
as
if
he
were
taking
my
measure
and
were
wondering
what
sort
of
chance
he
have
against
me
in
a
fight
but
i
suppose
my
height
must
have
rather
scared
him
for
he
changed
his
tone
and
began
to
whine
i
have
got
the
lady
purse
me
i
ai
i
was
only
a
asking
of
the
time
hand
over
that
purse
i
said
sternly
approaching
a
step
nearer
to
him
one
of
the
others
here
intervened
let
stowch
dog
there
a
copper
in
sight
with
that
they
began
to
close
upon
me
but
as
the
saying
goes
been
there
before
i
not
been
knocking
about
the
rough
side
of
the
world
for
fifteen
years
without
learning
how
to
take
care
of
myself
when
they
had
had
about
enough
of
it
which
was
most
likely
more
than
they
had
bargained
for
i
took
the
purse
and
went
to
where
the
innocent
cause
of
it
all
was
standing
she
was
looking
very
white
and
scared
but
she
plucked
up
sufficient
courage
to
thank
me
prettily
i
can
see
her
now
standing
there
looking
into
my
face
with
big
tears
in
her
pretty
blue
eyes
she
was
a
girl
of
about
or
two
years
of
age
tall
but
slenderly
built
with
a
sweet
oval
face
bright
brown
hair
and
the
most
beautiful
eyes
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
she
was
dressed
in
some
dark
green
material
wore
a
fawn
jacket
and
because
the
afternoon
was
cold
had
a
boa
of
marten
fur
round
her
neck
i
can
remember
also
that
her
hat
was
of
some
flimsy
make
with
lace
and
glittering
spear
points
in
it
and
that
the
whole
structure
was
surmounted
by
two
bows
one
of
black
ribbon
the
other
of
salmon
pink
oh
how
can
i
thank
you
she
began
when
i
had
come
up
with
her
but
for
your
appearance
i
do
know
what
those
men
might
not
have
done
to
me
i
was
very
glad
that
i
there
to
help
you
i
replied
looking
into
her
face
with
more
admiration
for
its
warm
young
beauty
than
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
shown
here
is
your
purse
i
hope
you
will
find
its
contents
safe
at
the
same
time
will
you
let
me
give
you
a
little
piece
of
advice
from
what
i
have
seen
this
afternoon
this
is
evidently
not
the
sort
of
place
for
a
young
lady
to
be
walking
in
alone
and
after
dark
i
do
think
i
would
risk
it
again
if
i
were
you
she
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
said
you
are
quite
right
i
have
only
myself
to
thank
for
my
misfortune
i
met
a
friend
and
walked
across
the
green
with
her
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
my
carriage
which
is
waiting
for
me
outside
when
i
met
those
men
however
i
can
promise
you
that
it
will
not
happen
again
i
am
leaving
sydney
in
a
day
or
two
somehow
when
i
heard
that
i
began
to
feel
glad
i
was
booked
to
leave
the
place
too
but
of
course
i
did
tell
her
so
may
i
see
you
safely
to
your
carriage
i
said
at
last
those
fellows
may
still
be
hanging
about
on
the
chance
of
overtaking
you
her
courage
must
have
come
back
to
her
for
she
looked
up
into
my
face
with
a
smile
i
do
think
they
will
be
rude
to
me
again
after
the
lesson
you
have
given
them
but
if
you
will
walk
with
me
i
shall
be
very
grateful
side
by
side
we
proceeded
down
the
path
through
the
gates
and
out
into
the
street
a
neat
brougham
was
drawn
up
alongside
the
kerb
and
towards
this
she
made
her
way
i
opened
the
door
and
held
it
for
her
to
get
in
but
before
she
did
so
she
turned
to
me
and
stretched
out
her
little
hand
will
you
tell
me
your
name
that
i
may
know
to
whom
i
am
indebted
my
name
is
hatteras
richard
hatteras
of
thursday
island
torres
straits
i
am
staying
at
the
thank
you
hatteras
again
and
again
i
shall
always
be
grateful
to
you
for
your
gallantry
this
was
attaching
too
much
importance
to
such
a
simple
action
and
i
was
about
to
tell
her
so
when
she
spoke
again
i
think
i
ought
to
let
you
know
who
i
am
my
name
is
wetherell
and
my
father
is
the
colonial
secretary
i
sure
he
will
be
quite
as
grateful
to
you
as
i
am
she
seemed
to
forget
that
we
had
already
shaken
hands
for
she
extended
her
own
a
second
time
i
took
it
and
tried
to
say
something
polite
but
she
stepped
into
her
carriage
and
shut
the
door
before
i
could
think
of
anything
and
next
moment
she
was
being
whirled
away
up
the
street
now
old
fogies
and
disappointed
spinsters
can
say
what
they
please
about
love
at
first
sight
i
not
a
romantic
sort
of
person
far
from
it
the
sort
of
life
i
had
hitherto
led
was
not
of
a
nature
calculated
to
foster
a
belief
in
that
sort
of
thing
but
if
i
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
when
i
resumed
my
walk
that
evening
well
i
never
known
what
the
passion
is
a
daintier
prettier
sweeter
little
angel
surely
never
walked
the
earth
than
the
girl
i
had
just
been
permitted
the
opportunity
of
rescuing
and
from
that
moment
forward
i
found
my
thoughts
constantly
reverting
to
her
i
seemed
to
retain
the
soft
pressure
of
her
fingers
in
mine
for
hours
afterwards
and
as
a
proof
of
the
perturbed
state
of
my
feelings
i
may
add
that
i
congratulated
myself
warmly
on
having
worn
that
day
my
new
and
fashionable
sydney
suit
instead
of
the
garments
in
which
i
had
travelled
down
from
torres
straits
and
which
i
had
hitherto
considered
quite
good
enough
for
even
high
days
and
holidays
that
she
herself
would
remember
me
for
more
than
an
hour
never
struck
me
as
being
likely
next
morning
i
donned
my
best
suit
again
gave
myself
an
extra
brush
up
and
sauntered
down
town
to
see
if
i
could
run
across
her
in
the
streets
what
reason
i
had
for
thinking
i
should
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
but
at
any
rate
i
was
not
destined
to
be
disappointed
crossing
george
street
a
carriage
passed
me
and
in
it
sat
the
girl
whose
fair
image
had
exercised
such
an
effect
upon
my
mind
that
she
saw
and
recognized
me
was
evidenced
by
the
gracious
bow
and
smile
with
which
she
favoured
me
then
she
passed
out
of
sight
and
it
was
a
wonder
that
that
minute
did
see
the
end
of
my
career
for
i
stood
like
one
in
a
dream
looking
in
the
direction
in
which
she
had
gone
and
it
was
not
until
two
carts
and
a
brewer
wagon
had
nearly
run
me
down
that
i
realized
it
would
be
safer
for
me
to
pursue
my
meditations
on
the
side
walk
i
got
back
to
my
hotel
by
and
during
the
progress
of
that
meal
a
brilliant
idea
struck
me
supposing
i
plucked
up
courage
and
called
why
not
it
would
be
only
a
polite
action
to
inquire
if
she
were
any
the
worse
for
her
fright
the
thought
was
no
sooner
born
in
my
brain
than
i
was
eager
to
be
off
but
it
was
too
early
for
such
a
formal
business
so
i
had
to
cool
my
heels
in
the
hall
for
an
hour
then
hailing
a
hansom
and
inquiring
the
direction
of
their
residence
i
drove
off
to
potts
point
the
house
was
the
last
in
the
street
an
imposing
mansion
standing
in
grounds
the
butler
answered
my
ring
and
in
response
to
my
inquiry
dashed
my
hopes
to
the
ground
by
informing
me
that
miss
wetherell
was
out
she
very
busy
you
see
at
present
sir
she
and
the
master
leave
for
england
on
friday
in
the
what
i
cried
almost
forgetting
myself
in
my
astonishment
you
mean
to
say
that
miss
wetherell
goes
to
england
in
the
i
do
sir
and
i
do
hear
she
goin
to
be
presented
at
court
sir
ah
thank
you
will
you
give
her
my
card
and
say
that
i
hope
she
is
none
the
worse
for
her
fright
last
evening
he
took
the
card
and
a
substantial
tip
with
it
and
i
went
back
to
my
cab
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
i
was
to
be
shipmates
with
this
lovely
creature
for
four
weeks
or
more
i
should
be
able
to
see
her
every
day
it
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
instinctively
i
began
to
make
all
sorts
of
plans
and
preparations
who
knew
but
what
but
stay
we
must
bring
ourselves
up
here
with
a
round
turn
or
we
shall
be
anticipating
what
to
come
to
make
a
long
story
short
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
what
i
am
telling
you
is
only
the
prelude
to
all
the
extraordinary
things
that
will
have
to
be
told
later
on
the
day
of
sailing
came
i
went
down
to
the
boat
on
the
morning
of
her
departure
and
got
my
baggage
safely
stowed
away
in
my
cabin
before
the
rush
set
in
about
three
we
hove
our
anchor
and
steamed
slowly
down
the
bay
i
had
been
below
when
the
wetherells
arrived
on
board
so
the
young
lady
had
not
yet
become
aware
of
my
presence
whether
she
would
betray
any
astonishment
when
she
did
find
out
was
beyond
my
power
to
tell
at
any
rate
i
know
that
i
was
by
a
long
way
the
happiest
man
aboard
the
boat
that
day
however
i
was
not
to
be
kept
long
in
suspense
before
we
had
reached
the
heads
it
was
all
settled
and
satisfactorily
so
i
was
standing
on
the
promenade
deck
just
abaft
the
main
saloon
entrance
watching
the
panorama
spread
out
before
me
when
i
heard
a
voice
i
recognized
only
too
well
say
behind
me
to
you
dear
old
sydney
great
things
will
have
happened
when
i
set
eyes
on
you
again
little
did
she
know
how
prophetic
were
her
words
as
she
spoke
i
turned
and
confronted
her
for
a
moment
she
was
overwhelmed
with
surprise
then
stretching
out
her
hand
she
said
really
hatteras
this
is
most
wonderful
you
are
the
last
person
i
expected
to
meet
on
board
and
perhaps
i
replied
i
might
with
justice
say
the
same
of
you
she
turned
to
a
tall
man
beside
her
papa
i
must
introduce
you
to
hatteras
you
will
remember
i
told
you
how
kind
hatteras
was
when
those
larrikins
were
rude
to
me
in
the
domain
i
am
sincerely
obliged
to
you
hatteras
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
and
shaking
mine
heartily
my
daughter
did
tell
me
and
i
called
yesterday
at
your
hotel
to
thank
you
personally
but
you
were
unfortunately
not
at
home
are
you
visiting
europe
yes
i
going
home
for
a
short
visit
to
see
the
place
where
my
father
was
born
are
you
then
like
myself
an
australian
native
i
mean
of
course
as
you
know
colonial
born
asked
miss
wetherell
with
a
little
laugh
the
idea
of
her
calling
herself
an
australian
native
in
any
other
sense
the
very
notion
seemed
preposterous
i
was
born
at
sea
a
degree
and
a
half
south
of
mauritius
i
answered
so
i
do
know
what
you
would
call
me
i
hope
you
have
comfortable
cabins
very
we
have
made
two
or
three
voyages
in
this
boat
before
and
we
always
take
the
same
places
and
now
papa
we
must
really
go
and
see
where
poor
miss
thompson
is
we
are
beginning
to
feel
the
swell
and
she
be
wanting
to
go
below
for
the
present
i
raised
my
cap
and
watched
her
walk
away
down
the
deck
balancing
herself
as
if
she
had
been
accustomed
to
a
heaving
plank
all
her
life
then
i
turned
to
watch
the
fast
receding
shore
and
to
my
own
thoughts
which
were
none
of
the
saddest
i
can
assure
you
for
it
must
be
confessed
here
and
why
should
i
deny
it
that
i
was
in
love
from
the
soles
of
my
deck
shoes
to
the
cap
upon
my
head
but
as
to
the
chance
that
i
a
humble
pearler
would
stand
with
one
of
sydney
most
beautiful
daughters
why
that
another
matter
and
one
that
for
the
present
i
was
anxious
to
keep
behind
me
within
the
week
we
had
left
adelaide
behind
us
and
four
days
later
albany
was
also
a
thing
of
the
past
by
the
time
we
had
cleared
the
lewin
we
had
all
settled
down
to
our
life
aboard
ship
the
bad
sailors
were
beginning
to
appear
on
deck
again
and
the
medium
voyagers
to
make
various
excuses
for
their
absences
from
meals
one
thing
was
evident
that
miss
wetherell
was
the
belle
of
the
ship
everybody
paid
her
attention
from
the
skipper
down
to
the
humblest
deck
hand
and
this
being
so
i
prudently
kept
out
of
the
way
for
i
had
no
desire
to
be
thought
to
presume
on
our
previous
acquaintance
whether
she
noticed
this
i
can
not
tell
but
at
any
rate
her
manner
to
me
when
we
speak
was
more
cordial
than
i
had
any
right
or
reason
to
expect
it
would
be
seeing
this
there
were
not
wanting
people
on
board
who
scoffed
and
sneered
at
the
idea
of
the
colonial
secretary
daughter
noticing
so
humble
a
person
as
myself
and
when
it
became
known
what
my
exact
social
position
was
i
promise
you
these
malicious
whisperings
did
not
cease
one
evening
two
or
three
days
after
we
had
left
colombo
behind
us
i
was
standing
at
the
rails
on
the
promenade
deck
a
little
abaft
the
entrance
when
miss
wetherell
came
up
and
took
her
place
beside
me
she
looked
very
dainty
and
sweet
in
her
evening
dress
and
i
felt
if
i
had
known
her
better
i
should
have
liked
to
tell
her
so
hatteras
said
she
when
we
had
discussed
the
weather
and
the
sunset
i
have
been
thinking
lately
that
you
desire
to
avoid
me
heaven
forbid
miss
wetherell
i
hastened
to
reply
what
on
earth
put
such
a
notion
into
your
head
all
the
same
i
believe
it
to
be
true
now
why
do
you
do
it
i
have
not
admitted
that
i
do
do
it
but
perhaps
if
i
do
seem
to
deny
myself
the
pleasure
of
being
with
you
as
much
as
some
other
people
i
could
mention
it
is
only
because
i
fail
to
see
what
possible
enjoyment
you
can
derive
from
my
society
that
is
a
very
pretty
speech
she
answered
smiling
but
it
does
not
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
and
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
know
my
dear
young
lady
i
want
to
know
why
you
are
so
much
changed
towards
me
at
first
we
got
on
splendidly
you
used
to
tell
me
of
your
life
in
torres
straits
of
your
trading
ventures
in
the
southern
seas
and
even
of
your
hopes
for
the
future
now
however
all
that
is
changed
it
is
miss
wetherell
miss
wetherell
and
that
is
all
i
must
own
i
do
like
such
treatment
i
must
crave
your
pardon
but
no
we
wo
have
any
if
you
want
to
be
forgiven
you
must
come
and
talk
to
me
as
you
used
to
do
you
will
like
the
rest
of
the
people
i
sure
when
you
get
to
know
them
they
are
very
kind
to
me
and
you
think
i
shall
like
them
for
that
reason
no
no
how
silly
you
are
but
i
do
so
want
you
to
be
friendly
after
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
for
me
to
push
myself
into
a
circle
where
i
had
the
best
reasons
for
knowing
that
i
was
not
wanted
however
it
had
its
good
side
i
saw
more
of
miss
wetherell
so
much
more
indeed
that
i
began
to
notice
that
her
father
did
not
quite
approve
of
it
but
whatever
he
may
have
thought
he
said
nothing
to
me
on
the
subject
a
fortnight
or
so
later
we
were
at
aden
leaving
that
barren
rock
about
four
and
entering
the
red
sea
the
same
evening
the
suez
canal
passed
through
and
port
said
behind
us
we
were
in
the
mediterranean
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
stood
in
europe
at
naples
the
wetherells
were
to
say
to
the
boat
and
continue
the
rest
of
their
journey
home
across
the
continent
as
the
hour
of
separation
approached
i
must
confess
i
began
to
dread
it
more
and
more
and
somehow
i
fancy
was
not
quite
as
happy
as
she
used
to
be
you
will
probably
ask
what
grounds
i
had
for
believing
that
a
girl
like
miss
wetherell
would
take
any
interest
in
a
man
like
myself
and
it
is
a
question
i
can
no
more
answer
than
i
can
fly
and
yet
when
i
came
to
think
it
all
out
i
was
not
without
my
hopes
we
were
to
reach
port
the
following
morning
the
night
was
very
still
the
water
almost
unruffled
somehow
it
came
about
that
miss
wetherell
and
i
found
ourselves
together
in
the
same
sheltered
spot
where
she
had
spoken
to
me
on
the
occasion
referred
to
before
the
stars
in
the
east
were
paling
preparatory
to
the
rising
of
the
moon
i
glanced
at
my
companion
as
she
leant
against
the
rails
scanning
the
quiet
sea
and
noticed
the
sweet
wistfulness
of
her
expression
then
suddenly
a
great
desire
came
over
me
to
tell
her
of
my
love
surely
even
if
she
could
not
return
it
there
would
be
no
harm
in
letting
her
know
how
i
felt
towards
her
for
this
reason
i
drew
a
little
closer
to
her
and
so
miss
wetherell
i
said
we
are
to
say
never
perhaps
to
meet
again
oh
no
hatteras
she
answered
we
wo
say
that
surely
we
shall
see
something
of
each
other
somewhere
the
world
is
very
tiny
after
all
to
those
who
desire
to
avoid
each
other
perhaps
but
for
those
who
wish
to
it
is
still
too
large
well
then
we
must
hope
for
the
best
who
knows
but
that
we
may
run
across
each
other
in
london
i
think
it
is
very
probable
and
will
that
meeting
be
altogether
distasteful
to
you
i
asked
quite
expecting
that
she
would
answer
with
her
usual
frankness
but
to
my
surprise
she
did
not
speak
only
turned
half
away
from
me
had
i
offended
her
miss
wetherell
pray
forgive
my
rudeness
i
said
hastily
i
ought
to
have
known
i
had
no
right
to
ask
you
such
a
question
and
why
should
you
she
replied
this
time
turning
her
sweet
face
towards
me
no
i
will
tell
you
frankly
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
you
again
with
that
all
the
blood
in
my
body
seemed
to
rush
to
my
head
could
i
be
dreaming
or
had
she
really
said
she
would
like
to
see
me
again
i
would
try
my
luck
now
whatever
came
of
it
you
can
not
think
how
pleasant
our
intercourse
has
been
to
me
i
said
and
now
i
have
to
go
back
to
my
lonely
miserable
existence
again
but
you
should
not
say
that
you
have
your
work
in
life
yes
but
what
is
that
to
me
when
i
have
no
one
to
work
for
can
you
conceive
anything
more
awful
than
my
loneliness
remember
as
far
as
i
know
i
am
absolutely
without
kith
and
kin
there
is
not
a
single
soul
to
care
for
me
in
the
whole
world
not
one
to
whom
my
death
would
be
a
matter
of
the
least
concern
oh
do
do
say
that
her
voice
faltered
so
that
i
turned
from
the
sea
and
contemplated
her
it
is
true
miss
wetherell
bitterly
true
it
is
not
true
it
can
not
be
true
if
only
i
could
think
it
would
be
some
little
matter
of
concern
to
you
i
should
go
back
to
my
work
with
a
happier
heart
again
she
turned
her
face
from
me
my
arm
lay
beside
hers
upon
the
bulwarks
and
i
could
feel
that
she
was
trembling
brutal
though
it
may
seem
to
say
so
this
gave
me
fresh
courage
i
said
slowly
bending
my
face
a
little
towards
her
would
it
affect
you
phyllis
one
little
hand
fell
from
the
bulwarks
to
her
side
and
i
took
possession
of
it
she
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
my
question
so
i
repeated
it
then
her
head
went
down
upon
the
bulwarks
but
not
before
i
had
caught
the
whispered
yes
that
escaped
her
lips
before
she
could
guess
what
was
going
to
happen
i
had
taken
her
in
my
arms
and
smothered
her
face
with
kisses
nor
did
she
offer
any
resistance
i
knew
the
whole
truth
now
she
was
mine
she
loved
me
me
me
me
the
whole
world
seemed
to
the
news
the
very
sea
to
ring
with
it
and
just
as
i
learned
from
her
own
dear
lips
the
story
of
her
love
the
great
moon
rose
as
if
to
listen
can
you
imagine
my
happiness
my
delight
she
was
mine
this
lovely
girl
my
very
own
bound
to
me
by
all
the
bonds
of
love
oh
happy
hour
oh
sweet
delight
i
pressed
her
to
my
heart
again
and
again
she
looked
into
my
face
and
then
away
from
me
her
sweet
eyes
suffused
with
tears
then
suddenly
her
expression
changed
i
turned
to
see
what
ailed
her
and
to
my
discomfiture
discovered
her
father
stalking
along
the
silent
deck
towards
us
whispering
to
her
to
leave
us
she
sped
away
and
i
was
left
alone
with
her
angry
parent
that
he
angry
i
judged
from
his
face
nor
was
i
wrong
in
my
conjecture
hatteras
he
said
severely
pray
what
does
this
mean
how
is
it
that
i
find
you
in
this
undignified
position
with
my
daughter
wetherell
i
answered
i
can
see
that
an
explanation
is
due
to
you
just
before
you
came
up
i
was
courageous
enough
to
tell
your
daughter
that
i
loved
her
she
has
been
generous
enough
to
inform
me
that
she
returns
my
affection
and
now
the
best
course
for
me
to
pursue
is
to
ask
your
permission
to
make
her
my
wife
you
presume
sir
upon
the
service
you
rendered
my
daughter
in
sydney
i
did
not
think
you
would
follow
it
up
in
this
fashion
your
daughter
is
free
to
love
whom
she
pleases
i
take
it
i
said
my
temper
getting
a
little
the
better
of
my
judgment
she
has
been
good
enough
to
promise
to
marry
me
if
i
can
obtain
your
permission
have
you
any
objection
to
raise
only
one
and
that
one
is
insuperable
understand
me
i
forbid
it
once
and
for
all
in
every
particular
without
hope
of
change
i
forbid
it
as
you
must
see
it
is
a
matter
which
affects
the
happiness
of
two
lives
i
feel
sure
you
will
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
your
reasons
i
must
decline
any
discussion
on
the
matter
at
all
you
have
my
answer
i
forbid
it
this
is
to
be
final
then
i
am
to
understand
that
you
are
not
to
be
brought
to
change
your
mind
by
any
actions
of
mine
no
sir
i
am
not
what
i
have
said
is
irrevocable
the
idea
is
not
to
be
thought
of
for
a
moment
and
while
i
am
on
this
subject
let
me
tell
you
that
your
conduct
towards
my
daughter
on
board
this
ship
has
been
very
distasteful
to
me
i
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
a
very
stay
wetherell
i
said
as
he
turned
to
go
you
have
been
kind
enough
to
favour
me
with
your
views
now
i
will
give
you
mine
your
daughter
loves
me
i
am
an
honest
and
an
industrious
man
and
i
love
her
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
i
tell
you
now
and
though
you
decline
to
treat
me
with
proper
fairness
i
give
you
warning
that
i
intend
to
marry
her
if
she
will
still
have
me
with
your
consent
or
without
it
you
are
insolent
sir
i
assure
you
i
have
no
desire
to
be
i
endeavour
to
remember
that
you
are
her
father
though
i
must
own
you
lack
her
sense
of
what
is
fair
and
right
i
will
not
discuss
the
question
any
further
with
you
you
know
my
absolute
decision
with
anger
and
happiness
struggling
in
my
breast
for
the
mastery
i
paced
that
deck
for
hours
my
heart
swelled
with
joy
at
the
knowledge
that
my
darling
loved
me
but
it
sank
like
lead
when
i
considered
the
difficulties
which
threatened
us
if
her
father
persisted
in
his
present
determination
at
last
just
as
eight
bells
was
striking
twelve
i
went
below
to
my
cabin
my
was
fast
asleep
a
fact
which
i
was
grateful
for
when
i
discovered
propped
against
my
a
tiny
envelope
with
my
name
upon
it
tearing
it
open
i
read
the
following
my
own
dearest
my
father
has
just
informed
me
of
his
interview
with
you
i
can
not
understand
it
or
ascribe
a
reason
for
it
but
whatever
happens
remember
that
i
will
be
your
wife
and
the
wife
of
no
other
may
god
bless
and
keep
you
always
your
own
phyllis
before
we
leave
the
ship
you
must
let
me
know
your
address
in
london
with
such
a
letter
under
my
pillow
can
it
be
doubted
that
my
dreams
were
good
little
i
guessed
the
accumulation
of
troubles
to
which
this
little
unpleasantness
with
wetherell
was
destined
to
be
the
prelude
chapter
ii
london
now
that
i
come
to
think
the
matter
out
i
do
know
that
i
could
give
you
any
definite
idea
of
what
my
first
impressions
of
london
were
one
thing
at
least
is
certain
i
had
never
had
experience
of
anything
approaching
such
a
city
before
and
between
ourselves
i
ca
say
that
i
ever
want
to
again
the
constant
rush
and
roar
of
traffic
the
crowds
of
people
jostling
each
other
on
the
pavements
the
happiness
and
the
misery
the
riches
and
the
poverty
all
mixed
up
together
in
one
jumble
like
good
and
bad
fruit
in
a
basket
fairly
took
my
breath
away
and
when
i
went
down
that
first
afternoon
and
saw
the
park
in
all
its
summer
glory
my
amazement
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
i
could
have
watched
the
carriages
horsemen
and
promenaders
for
hours
on
end
without
any
sense
of
weariness
and
when
a
bystander
seeing
that
i
was
a
stranger
took
compassion
upon
my
ignorance
and
condescended
to
point
out
to
me
the
various
celebrities
present
my
pleasure
was
complete
there
certainly
is
no
place
like
london
for
show
and
glitter
i
grant
you
that
but
all
the
same
i
no
more
think
of
taking
up
my
permanent
abode
in
it
than
i
try
to
cross
the
atlantic
in
a
chinese
sampan
having
before
i
left
sydney
been
recommended
to
a
quiet
hotel
in
a
neighbourhood
near
the
strand
convenient
both
for
and
business
i
had
my
luggage
conveyed
thither
and
prepared
to
make
myself
comfortable
for
a
time
every
day
i
waited
eagerly
for
a
letter
from
my
sweetheart
the
more
impatiently
because
its
convinced
me
that
they
had
not
yet
arrived
in
london
as
it
turned
out
they
had
delayed
their
departure
from
naples
for
two
days
and
had
spent
another
three
in
florence
two
in
rome
and
a
day
and
a
half
in
paris
one
morning
however
my
faithful
watch
over
the
letter
rack
which
was
already
becoming
a
standing
joke
in
the
hotel
was
rewarded
an
envelope
bearing
an
english
stamp
and
postmark
and
addressed
in
a
handwriting
as
familiar
to
me
as
my
own
stared
me
in
the
face
to
take
it
out
and
break
the
seal
was
the
work
of
a
moment
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
lines
but
it
brought
me
news
that
raised
me
to
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
and
miss
wetherell
had
arrived
in
london
the
previous
afternoon
they
were
staying
at
the
would
leave
town
for
the
country
at
the
end
of
the
week
but
in
the
meantime
if
i
wished
to
see
her
my
sweetheart
would
be
in
the
entrance
hall
of
the
british
museum
the
following
morning
at
eleven
how
i
conducted
myself
in
the
interval
between
my
receipt
of
the
letter
and
the
time
of
the
appointment
i
have
not
the
least
remembrance
i
know
however
that
ten
on
the
following
morning
found
me
pacing
up
and
down
the
street
before
that
venerable
pile
scanning
with
eager
eyes
every
conveyance
that
approached
me
the
minutes
dragged
by
with
intolerable
slowness
but
at
length
the
time
arrived
a
kindly
church
clock
in
the
neighbourhood
struck
the
hour
and
others
all
round
it
immediately
took
up
the
tale
before
the
last
stroke
had
died
away
a
hansom
turned
towards
the
gates
from
bury
street
and
in
it
looking
the
picture
of
health
and
beauty
sat
the
girl
who
i
had
good
reason
to
know
was
more
than
all
the
world
to
me
to
attract
her
attention
and
signal
to
the
driver
to
pull
up
was
the
work
of
a
second
and
a
minute
later
i
had
helped
her
to
alight
and
we
were
strolling
together
across
the
square
towards
the
building
ah
dick
she
said
with
a
roguish
smile
you
do
know
what
trouble
i
had
to
get
away
this
morning
papa
had
a
dozen
places
he
wished
me
to
go
to
with
him
but
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
some
very
important
business
of
my
own
to
attend
to
before
i
could
go
calling
he
was
kind
enough
to
let
me
off
i
be
bound
he
thought
you
meant
business
with
a
dressmaker
i
laughingly
replied
determined
to
show
her
that
i
was
not
unversed
in
the
ways
of
women
i
afraid
he
did
she
answered
blushing
and
i
feel
horribly
guilty
but
my
heart
told
me
i
must
see
you
at
once
whatever
happened
could
any
man
desire
a
prettier
speech
than
that
if
so
i
was
not
that
man
we
were
inside
the
building
by
this
time
ascending
the
great
staircase
as
we
entered
the
room
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
ask
the
question
i
had
been
longing
to
put
to
her
phyllis
my
sweetheart
i
said
with
a
tremor
in
my
voice
it
is
a
fortnight
now
since
i
spoke
to
you
you
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
consider
our
position
have
you
regretted
giving
me
your
love
we
came
to
a
standstill
and
leant
over
a
case
together
but
what
it
contained
i
sure
i
have
the
very
vaguest
idea
she
looked
up
into
my
face
with
a
sweet
smile
not
for
one
single
instant
dick
having
once
given
you
my
love
is
it
likely
i
should
want
it
back
again
i
do
know
somehow
i
ca
discover
sufficient
reason
for
your
giving
it
to
me
at
all
well
be
sure
i
not
going
to
tell
you
you
might
grow
conceited
is
it
sufficient
that
i
love
you
and
that
i
am
not
going
to
give
you
up
whatever
happens
more
than
sufficient
i
answered
solemnly
but
phyllis
do
you
think
i
can
induce
your
father
to
relent
surely
as
a
good
parent
he
must
be
anxious
to
promote
your
happiness
at
any
cost
to
himself
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
he
has
been
so
devoted
to
me
all
my
life
that
his
conduct
now
is
quite
inexplicable
never
once
has
he
denied
me
anything
i
really
set
my
heart
upon
and
he
always
promised
me
that
i
should
be
allowed
to
marry
whomsoever
i
pleased
provided
he
was
a
good
and
honourable
man
and
one
of
whom
he
could
in
any
way
approve
and
you
are
all
that
dick
or
i
should
have
loved
you
i
know
i
do
think
i
any
worse
than
the
ordinary
run
of
men
dearest
if
i
am
no
better
at
any
rate
i
love
you
with
a
true
and
honourable
love
but
do
you
think
he
will
come
round
in
time
i
almost
afraid
not
he
referred
to
it
only
yesterday
and
seemed
quite
angry
that
i
should
have
dared
to
entertain
any
thought
of
you
after
what
he
said
to
me
on
board
ship
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
he
ever
spoke
to
me
in
such
a
tone
and
i
felt
it
keenly
no
dick
there
is
something
behind
it
all
that
i
can
not
understand
some
mystery
that
i
would
give
anything
to
fathom
papa
has
not
been
himself
ever
since
we
started
for
england
indeed
his
very
reason
for
coming
at
all
is
an
enigma
to
me
and
now
that
he
here
he
seems
in
continual
dread
of
meeting
somebody
but
who
that
somebody
is
and
why
my
father
who
has
the
name
and
reputation
of
being
such
a
courageous
determined
honourable
man
should
be
afraid
is
a
thing
i
can
not
understand
it
all
very
mysterious
and
unfortunate
but
surely
something
can
be
done
do
you
think
if
i
were
to
see
him
again
and
put
the
matter
more
plainly
before
him
something
might
be
arranged
it
would
be
worse
than
useless
at
present
i
fear
no
you
must
just
leave
it
to
me
and
i
do
my
best
to
talk
him
round
ever
since
my
mother
died
i
have
been
as
his
right
hand
and
it
will
be
strange
if
he
does
not
listen
to
me
and
see
reason
in
the
end
seeing
who
it
was
that
would
plead
with
him
i
did
not
doubt
it
by
this
time
we
had
wandered
through
many
rooms
and
now
found
ourselves
in
the
egyptian
department
surrounded
by
embalmed
dead
folk
and
queer
objects
of
all
sorts
and
descriptions
there
was
something
almost
startling
about
our
in
such
a
place
among
these
men
and
women
whose
wooings
had
been
conducted
in
a
country
so
widely
different
to
ours
and
in
an
age
that
was
dead
and
gone
over
two
thousand
years
ere
we
were
born
i
spoke
of
this
to
phyllis
she
laughed
and
gave
a
little
shiver
i
wonder
she
said
looking
down
on
the
figure
of
a
princess
of
the
royal
house
of
egypt
lying
stretched
out
in
the
case
beside
which
we
sat
if
this
great
lady
who
lies
so
still
and
silent
now
had
any
trouble
with
her
love
affair
perhaps
she
had
more
than
one
beau
to
her
string
and
not
being
allowed
to
have
one
took
the
other
i
answered
though
from
what
we
can
see
of
her
now
she
does
look
as
if
she
were
ever
capable
of
exercising
much
fascination
does
she
as
i
spoke
i
looked
from
the
case
to
the
girl
and
compared
the
figure
with
the
healthy
living
lovely
creature
by
my
side
but
i
had
much
time
for
comparison
my
sweetheart
had
taken
her
watch
from
her
pocket
and
was
glancing
at
the
dial
a
quarter
to
twelve
she
cried
in
alarm
oh
dick
i
must
be
going
i
promised
to
meet
papa
at
twelve
and
i
must
not
keep
him
waiting
she
rose
and
was
about
to
pull
on
her
gloves
but
before
she
had
time
to
do
so
i
had
taken
a
little
case
from
my
pocket
and
opened
it
when
she
saw
what
it
contained
she
could
not
help
a
little
womanly
cry
of
delight
oh
dick
you
naughty
extravagant
boy
why
dearest
why
naughty
or
extravagant
to
give
the
woman
i
love
a
little
token
of
my
affection
as
i
spoke
i
slipped
the
ring
over
her
pretty
ringer
and
raised
the
hand
to
my
lips
will
you
try
i
said
whenever
you
look
at
that
ring
to
remember
that
the
man
who
gave
it
to
you
loves
you
with
his
whole
heart
and
soul
and
will
count
no
trouble
too
great
or
no
exertion
too
hard
to
make
you
happy
i
will
remember
she
said
solemnly
and
when
i
looked
i
saw
that
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
she
brushed
them
hastily
away
and
after
an
interlude
which
it
hardly
becomes
me
to
mention
here
we
went
down
the
stairs
again
and
out
into
the
street
almost
in
silence
having
called
a
cab
i
placed
her
in
it
and
nervously
asked
the
question
that
had
been
sometime
upon
my
mind
when
shall
i
see
you
again
i
can
not
tell
she
answered
perhaps
next
week
but
i
let
you
know
in
the
meantime
do
despair
all
will
come
right
yet
and
god
bless
you
having
seen
the
last
of
her
i
wandered
slowly
down
the
pavement
towards
oxford
street
then
turning
to
my
left
hand
made
my
way
citywards
my
mind
was
full
of
my
interview
with
the
sweet
girl
who
had
just
left
me
and
i
wandered
on
and
on
wrapped
in
my
own
thoughts
until
i
found
myself
in
a
quarter
of
london
into
which
i
had
never
hitherto
penetrated
the
streets
were
narrow
and
as
if
to
be
in
keeping
with
the
general
air
of
gloom
the
shops
were
small
and
their
wares
of
a
peculiarly
sordid
nature
a
church
clock
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
struck
one
and
as
i
was
beginning
to
feel
hungry
and
knew
myself
to
be
a
long
way
from
my
hotel
i
cast
about
me
for
a
but
it
was
some
time
before
i
encountered
the
class
of
restaurant
i
wanted
when
i
did
it
was
situated
at
the
corner
of
two
streets
carried
a
foreign
name
over
the
door
and
though
considerably
the
worse
for
wear
presented
a
cleaner
appearance
than
any
other
i
had
as
yet
experienced
pushing
the
door
open
i
entered
an
unmistakable
frenchman
whose
appearance
however
betokened
long
residence
in
england
stood
behind
a
narrow
counter
polishing
an
absinthe
glass
he
bowed
politely
and
asked
my
business
can
i
have
lunch
i
asked
oui
monsieur
if
monsieur
will
walk
upstairs
i
will
take
his
order
waving
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
a
staircase
in
the
corner
of
the
shop
he
again
bowed
elaborately
while
i
following
the
direction
he
indicated
proceeded
to
the
room
above
it
was
long
and
lofty
commanded
an
excellent
view
of
both
thoroughfares
and
was
furnished
with
a
few
inferior
pictures
half
a
dozen
small
tables
and
four
times
as
many
chairs
when
i
entered
three
men
were
in
occupation
two
were
playing
chess
at
a
side
table
while
the
third
who
had
evidently
no
connection
with
them
was
watching
the
game
from
a
distance
at
the
same
time
pretending
to
be
absorbed
in
his
paper
seating
myself
at
a
table
near
the
door
i
examined
the
bill
of
fare
selected
my
lunch
and
in
order
to
amuse
myself
while
it
was
preparing
fell
to
scrutinizing
my
companions
of
the
one
was
a
big
burly
fellow
with
enormous
arms
protruding
rheumy
eyes
a
florid
complexion
and
a
voluminous
red
beard
his
opponent
was
of
a
much
smaller
build
with
pale
features
a
tiny
moustache
and
watery
blue
eyes
he
wore
a
and
from
the
length
of
his
hair
and
a
dab
of
crimson
lake
upon
his
shirt
cuff
i
argued
him
an
artist
leaving
the
my
eyes
lighted
on
the
stranger
on
the
other
side
he
was
more
interesting
in
every
way
indeed
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
man
of
his
stamp
in
the
house
at
all
he
was
tall
and
slim
but
exquisitely
formed
and
plainly
the
possessor
of
enormous
strength
his
head
if
only
from
a
phrenological
point
of
view
was
a
magnificent
one
crowned
with
a
wealth
of
hair
his
eyes
were
dark
as
night
and
glittered
like
those
of
a
snake
his
complexion
was
of
a
decidedly
olive
hue
though
as
he
sat
in
the
shadow
of
the
corner
it
was
difficult
to
tell
this
at
first
sight
but
what
most
fascinated
me
about
this
curious
individual
was
the
interest
he
was
taking
in
the
game
the
other
men
were
playing
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
board
looked
anxiously
from
one
to
the
other
as
a
move
trembled
in
the
balance
smiled
sardonically
when
his
desires
were
realized
and
sighed
almost
aloud
when
a
mistake
was
made
every
moment
i
expected
his
anxiety
or
disappointment
to
find
vent
in
words
but
he
always
managed
to
control
himself
when
he
became
excited
i
noticed
that
his
whole
body
quivered
under
its
influence
and
once
when
the
smaller
of
the
players
made
an
injudicious
move
a
look
flew
into
his
face
that
was
full
of
such
malignant
intensity
that
i
own
i
was
influenced
by
it
what
effect
it
would
have
had
upon
the
innocent
cause
of
it
all
had
he
seen
it
i
should
have
been
sorry
to
conjecture
just
as
my
lunch
made
its
appearance
the
game
reached
a
conclusion
and
the
taller
of
the
two
players
having
made
a
remark
in
german
rose
to
leave
it
was
evident
that
the
smaller
man
had
won
and
in
an
excess
of
pride
to
which
i
gathered
his
nature
was
not
altogether
a
stranger
he
looked
round
the
room
as
if
in
defiance
doing
so
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
man
in
the
corner
i
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
but
my
gaze
rested
longest
on
the
face
of
the
smaller
man
so
fascinated
did
he
seem
to
be
by
the
other
stare
that
his
eyes
became
set
and
stony
it
was
just
as
if
he
were
being
mesmerized
the
person
he
looked
at
rose
approached
him
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
to
arrange
the
men
on
the
board
then
he
looked
up
again
may
i
have
the
pleasure
of
giving
you
a
game
he
asked
in
excellent
english
bowing
slightly
as
he
spoke
and
moving
a
pawn
with
his
long
white
fingers
the
little
man
found
voice
enough
to
murmur
an
appropriate
reply
and
they
began
their
game
while
i
turned
to
my
lunch
but
in
spite
of
myself
i
found
my
eyes
continually
reverting
to
what
was
happening
at
the
other
table
and
indeed
it
was
a
curious
sight
i
saw
there
the
tall
man
had
thrown
himself
into
the
business
of
the
game
heart
and
soul
he
half
sat
half
crouched
over
the
board
reminding
me
of
a
hawk
hovering
over
a
poultry
yard
his
eyes
were
riveted
first
on
the
men
before
him
and
then
on
his
opponent
his
long
fingers
twitched
and
twined
over
each
move
and
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
release
their
hold
not
once
did
he
speak
but
his
attitude
was
more
expressive
than
any
words
the
effect
on
the
little
man
his
companion
was
overwhelming
he
was
quite
unable
to
do
anything
but
sat
huddled
up
in
his
chair
as
if
terrified
by
his
demoniacal
companion
the
result
even
a
child
might
have
foreseen
the
tall
man
won
and
the
little
man
only
too
glad
to
have
come
out
of
the
ordeal
with
a
whole
skin
seized
his
hat
and
with
a
apology
darted
from
the
room
for
a
moment
or
two
his
extraordinary
opponent
sat
playing
with
the
chessmen
then
he
looked
across
at
me
and
without
hesitation
said
accompanying
his
remark
with
a
curious
smile
for
which
i
could
not
at
all
account
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
the
limitations
of
the
fool
are
the
birth
gifts
of
the
wise
not
knowing
what
reply
to
make
to
this
singular
assertion
i
wisely
held
my
tongue
this
brought
about
a
change
in
his
demeanour
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
came
across
to
where
i
sat
seating
himself
in
a
chair
directly
opposite
me
he
folded
his
hands
in
his
lap
after
the
manner
of
a
demure
old
spinster
and
having
looked
at
me
earnestly
said
with
an
almost
indescribable
sweetness
of
tone
i
think
you
will
allow
hatteras
that
half
the
world
is
born
for
the
other
half
to
prey
upon
for
a
moment
i
was
too
much
astonished
to
speak
how
on
earth
had
he
become
aware
of
my
name
i
stumbled
out
some
sort
of
reply
which
evidently
did
not
impress
him
very
much
for
he
began
again
our
friend
who
has
just
left
us
will
most
certainly
be
one
of
those
preyed
upon
i
pity
him
because
he
will
not
have
the
smallest
grain
of
pleasure
in
his
life
you
hatteras
on
the
other
hand
will
unwittingly
be
in
the
other
camp
circumstances
will
arrange
that
for
you
some
have
of
course
no
desire
to
prey
but
necessity
forces
it
on
them
yourself
for
instance
some
only
prey
when
they
are
quite
sure
there
will
be
no
manner
of
risk
our
german
friend
who
played
the
previous
game
is
an
example
others
again
never
lose
an
opportunity
candidly
speaking
to
which
class
should
you
imagine
i
belong
he
smiled
as
he
put
the
question
and
his
thin
lips
parting
i
could
just
catch
the
glitter
of
the
short
teeth
with
which
his
mouth
was
furnished
for
the
third
time
since
i
had
made
his
acquaintance
i
did
not
know
which
way
to
answer
however
i
made
a
shot
and
said
something
i
really
know
nothing
about
you
i
answered
but
from
your
kindness
in
giving
our
artist
friend
a
game
and
now
in
allowing
me
the
benefit
of
your
conversation
i
should
say
you
only
prey
upon
your
when
dire
extremity
drives
you
to
it
and
you
would
be
wrong
i
am
of
the
last
class
i
mentioned
there
is
only
one
sport
of
any
interest
to
me
in
life
and
that
is
the
opportunity
of
making
capital
out
of
my
fellow
humans
you
see
i
am
candid
with
you
mr
hatteras
pray
excuse
me
but
you
know
my
name
as
i
have
never
to
my
knowledge
set
eyes
on
you
before
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
became
acquainted
with
it
with
every
pleasure
but
before
i
do
so
i
think
it
only
fair
to
tell
you
that
you
will
not
believe
my
explanation
and
yet
it
convince
you
at
any
rate
we
try
in
your
top
waistcoat
pocket
you
have
three
cards
here
he
leant
his
head
on
his
hands
and
shut
his
eyes
one
is
crinkled
and
torn
but
it
has
written
on
it
in
pencil
the
name
of
edward
braithwaite
macquarrie
street
sydney
i
presume
the
name
is
braithwaite
but
the
and
are
almost
illegible
the
second
is
rather
a
one
the
hon
sylvester
wetherell
potts
point
sydney
new
south
wales
and
the
third
is
i
take
it
your
own
richard
hatteras
am
i
right
i
put
my
fingers
in
my
pocket
and
drew
out
what
it
contained
a
a
shilling
a
small
piece
of
pencil
and
three
cards
the
first
a
piece
of
pasteboard
bore
surely
enough
the
name
of
edward
braithwaite
and
was
that
of
the
solicitor
with
whom
i
transacted
my
business
in
sydney
the
second
was
given
me
by
my
sweetheart
father
the
day
before
we
left
australia
and
the
third
was
certainly
my
own
was
this
witchcraft
or
only
some
clever
conjuring
trick
i
asked
myself
the
question
but
could
give
it
no
satisfactory
answer
at
any
rate
you
may
be
sure
it
did
not
lessen
my
respect
for
my
singular
companion
ah
i
am
right
then
he
cried
exultingly
is
it
strange
how
the
love
of
being
right
remains
with
us
when
we
think
we
have
safely
combated
every
other
well
hatteras
i
am
very
pleased
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
somehow
i
think
we
are
destined
to
meet
again
where
i
can
not
say
at
any
rate
let
us
hope
that
that
meeting
will
be
as
pleasant
and
successful
as
this
has
been
but
i
hardly
heard
what
he
said
i
was
still
puzzling
my
brains
over
his
extraordinary
conjuring
trick
for
trick
i
am
convinced
it
was
he
had
risen
and
was
slowly
drawing
on
his
gloves
when
i
spoke
i
have
been
thinking
over
those
cards
i
said
and
i
am
considerably
puzzled
how
on
earth
did
you
know
they
were
there
if
i
told
you
you
would
have
no
more
faith
in
my
powers
so
with
your
permission
i
will
assume
the
virtue
of
modesty
call
it
a
conjuring
trick
if
you
like
many
curious
things
are
hidden
under
that
comprehensive
term
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
before
i
go
would
you
like
to
see
one
more
very
much
indeed
if
it
as
good
as
the
last
in
the
window
stood
a
large
glass
dish
half
full
of
water
and
having
a
dark
brown
fly
paper
floating
on
the
surface
he
brought
it
across
to
the
table
at
which
i
sat
and
having
drained
the
water
into
a
jug
near
by
left
the
paper
sticking
to
the
bottom
this
done
he
took
a
tiny
leather
case
from
his
pocket
and
a
small
bottle
out
of
that
again
from
this
bottle
he
poured
a
few
drops
of
some
highly
pungent
liquid
on
to
the
paper
with
the
result
that
it
grew
black
as
ink
and
threw
off
a
tiny
vapour
which
licked
the
edges
of
the
bowl
and
curled
upwards
in
a
faint
spiral
column
there
hatteras
this
is
a
well
a
trick
i
learned
from
an
old
woman
in
benares
it
is
a
better
one
than
the
last
and
will
repay
your
interest
if
you
will
look
on
that
paper
for
a
moment
and
try
to
concentrate
your
attention
you
will
see
something
that
will
i
think
astonish
you
hardly
believing
that
i
should
see
anything
at
all
i
looked
but
for
some
seconds
without
success
my
scepticism
however
soon
left
me
at
first
i
saw
only
the
coarse
grain
of
the
paper
and
the
thin
vapour
rising
from
it
then
the
knowledge
that
i
was
gazing
into
a
dish
vanished
i
forget
my
companion
and
the
previous
conjuring
trick
i
saw
only
a
picture
opening
out
before
me
that
of
a
handsomely
furnished
room
in
which
was
a
girl
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
crying
as
if
her
heart
were
breaking
the
room
i
had
never
seen
before
but
the
girl
i
should
have
known
among
a
thousand
was
phyllis
my
sweetheart
i
looked
and
looked
and
as
i
gazed
at
her
i
heard
her
call
my
name
oh
dick
dick
come
to
me
instantly
i
sprang
to
my
feet
meaning
to
cross
the
room
to
her
next
moment
i
became
aware
of
a
loud
crash
the
scene
vanished
my
senses
came
back
to
me
and
to
my
astonishment
i
found
myself
standing
alongside
the
overturned
restaurant
table
the
glass
dish
lay
on
the
floor
shattered
into
a
thousand
fragments
my
friend
the
conjuror
had
disappeared
having
righted
the
table
again
i
went
downstairs
and
explained
my
misfortune
when
i
had
paid
my
bill
i
took
my
departure
more
troubled
in
mind
than
i
cared
to
confess
that
it
was
only
what
he
had
called
it
a
conjuring
trick
i
felt
i
ought
to
be
certain
but
still
it
was
clever
and
uncanny
enough
to
render
me
very
uncomfortable
in
vain
i
tried
to
drive
the
remembrance
of
the
scene
i
had
witnessed
from
my
brain
but
it
would
not
be
dispelled
at
length
to
satisfy
myself
i
resolved
that
if
the
memory
of
it
remained
with
me
so
vividly
in
the
morning
i
would
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
call
at
the
to
make
inquiries
i
returned
to
my
hotel
in
time
for
dinner
but
still
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
feeling
that
some
calamity
was
approaching
having
sent
my
meal
away
almost
untouched
i
called
a
hansom
and
drove
to
the
nearest
theatre
but
the
picture
of
phyllis
crying
and
calling
for
me
in
vain
kept
me
company
throughout
the
performance
and
brought
me
home
more
miserable
at
the
end
than
i
had
started
all
night
long
i
dreamed
of
it
seeing
the
same
picture
again
and
again
and
hearing
the
same
despairing
cry
oh
dick
dick
come
to
me
in
the
morning
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
accordingly
after
breakfast
i
set
off
to
make
sure
that
nothing
was
the
matter
on
the
way
i
tried
to
reason
with
myself
i
asked
how
it
was
that
i
dick
hatteras
a
man
who
thought
he
knew
the
world
so
well
should
have
been
so
impressed
with
a
bit
of
wizardry
as
to
be
willing
to
risk
making
a
fool
of
myself
before
the
two
last
people
in
the
world
i
wanted
to
think
me
one
once
i
almost
determined
to
turn
back
but
while
the
intention
held
me
the
picture
rose
again
before
my
mind
eye
and
on
i
went
more
resolved
to
solve
the
mystery
arriving
at
the
hotel
a
gorgeously
caparisoned
porter
who
stood
on
the
steps
said
in
response
to
my
inquiry
they
left
sir
started
yesterday
afternoon
quite
suddenly
for
paris
on
their
way
back
to
australia
chapter
iii
i
visit
my
relations
for
the
moment
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
gone
why
had
they
gone
what
could
have
induced
them
to
leave
england
so
suddenly
i
questioned
the
hall
porter
on
the
subject
but
he
could
tell
me
nothing
save
that
they
had
departed
for
paris
the
previous
day
intending
to
proceed
across
the
continent
in
order
to
catch
the
first
australian
boat
at
naples
feeling
that
i
should
only
look
ridiculous
if
i
stayed
questioning
the
man
any
longer
i
pressed
a
tip
into
his
hand
and
went
slowly
back
to
my
own
hotel
to
try
and
think
it
all
out
but
though
i
devoted
some
hours
to
it
i
could
arrive
at
no
satisfactory
conclusion
the
one
vital
point
remained
and
was
not
to
be
disputed
they
were
gone
but
the
mail
that
evening
brought
me
enlightenment
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
written
in
london
and
posted
in
dover
it
ran
as
follows
monday
afternoon
my
own
something
terrible
has
happened
to
papa
i
can
not
tell
you
what
because
i
do
not
know
myself
he
went
out
this
morning
in
the
best
of
health
and
spirits
and
returned
half
an
hour
ago
trembling
like
a
leaf
and
white
as
a
sheet
he
had
only
strength
enough
left
to
reach
a
chair
in
my
before
he
fainted
dead
away
when
he
came
to
himself
again
he
said
your
maid
to
pack
at
once
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
we
start
for
paris
this
evening
to
catch
the
next
boat
leaving
naples
for
australia
i
said
papa
a
word
he
answered
have
seen
somebody
this
morning
whose
presence
renders
it
impossible
for
us
to
remain
an
instant
longer
in
england
go
and
pack
at
once
unless
you
wish
my
death
to
lie
at
your
door
after
that
i
could
of
course
say
nothing
i
have
packed
and
now
in
half
an
hour
we
leave
england
again
if
i
could
only
see
you
to
say
but
that
too
is
impossible
i
can
not
tell
what
it
all
means
but
that
it
is
very
serious
business
that
takes
us
away
so
suddenly
i
feel
convinced
my
father
seems
frightened
to
remain
in
london
a
minute
longer
than
he
can
help
he
even
stands
at
the
window
as
i
write
earnestly
scrutinizing
everybody
who
enters
the
hotel
and
now
my
own
but
what
follows
the
reiterations
of
her
affection
her
vows
to
be
true
to
me
could
have
no
possible
interest
for
any
one
save
lovers
i
sat
like
one
stunned
all
enjoyment
seemed
suddenly
to
have
gone
out
of
life
for
me
i
could
only
sit
twirling
the
paper
in
my
hand
and
picturing
the
train
flying
remorselessly
across
france
bearing
away
from
me
the
girl
i
loved
better
than
all
the
world
i
went
down
to
the
park
but
the
scene
there
had
no
longer
any
interest
in
my
eyes
i
went
later
on
to
a
theatre
but
i
found
no
enjoyment
in
the
piece
performed
london
had
suddenly
become
distasteful
to
me
i
felt
i
must
get
out
of
it
but
where
could
i
go
every
place
was
alike
in
my
present
humour
then
one
of
the
original
motives
of
my
journey
rose
before
me
and
i
determined
to
act
on
the
suggestion
next
morning
i
accordingly
set
off
for
hampshire
to
try
if
possible
to
find
my
father
old
home
what
sort
of
a
place
it
would
turn
out
to
be
i
had
not
the
very
remotest
idea
leaving
the
train
at
lyndhurst
road
for
the
village
i
was
in
search
of
was
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
new
forest
i
hired
a
ramshackle
conveyance
from
the
nearest
innkeeper
and
started
off
for
it
the
man
who
drove
me
had
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
so
he
found
early
occasion
to
inform
me
all
his
seventy
odd
years
and
it
struck
him
as
a
humorous
circumstance
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
been
even
as
far
as
southampton
a
matter
of
only
ten
minutes
by
rail
we
had
travelled
a
matter
of
two
miles
when
it
struck
me
to
ask
my
charioteer
about
the
place
to
which
we
were
proceeding
it
was
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
i
thought
that
he
might
once
have
known
my
father
i
determined
to
try
him
so
waiting
till
we
had
passed
a
load
of
hay
coming
along
the
lane
i
put
the
question
to
him
to
my
surprise
he
had
no
sooner
heard
the
name
than
he
became
as
excited
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
be
hatteras
he
cried
be
ye
a
hatteras
well
well
now
dearie
me
who
ha
thought
it
do
you
know
the
name
so
well
then
ay
ay
i
know
the
name
well
enough
who
does
in
these
parts
there
was
the
old
squire
and
lady
margaret
when
first
i
remember
then
squire
jasper
and
his
son
the
captain
as
was
killed
in
the
mutiny
in
foreign
parts
and
master
james
james
that
was
my
father
name
james
dymoke
hatteras
you
master
james
son
you
do
say
well
well
now
to
think
of
that
too
him
that
ran
away
from
home
after
words
with
the
squire
and
went
to
foreign
parts
who
have
thought
it
sir
william
will
be
right
down
glad
to
see
ye
i
be
bound
sir
william
and
who
sir
william
he
the
only
one
left
now
sir
lives
up
at
the
house
ah
dear
ah
dear
there
been
a
power
o
trouble
in
the
family
these
years
past
by
this
time
the
aspect
of
the
country
was
changing
we
had
left
the
lane
behind
us
ascended
a
short
hill
and
were
now
descending
it
again
through
what
looked
to
my
eyes
more
like
a
stately
private
avenue
than
a
public
road
beautiful
elms
reared
themselves
on
either
hand
and
intermingled
their
branches
overhead
while
before
us
through
a
gap
in
the
foliage
we
could
just
distinguish
the
winding
river
with
the
thatched
roofs
of
the
village
of
which
we
had
come
in
search
lining
its
banks
and
the
old
grey
tower
of
the
church
keeping
watch
and
ward
over
all
there
was
to
my
mind
something
indescribably
peaceful
and
even
sad
about
that
view
a
mute
sympathy
with
the
past
that
i
could
hardly
account
for
seeing
that
i
was
colonial
born
and
bred
for
the
first
time
since
my
arrival
in
england
the
real
beauty
of
the
place
came
home
upon
me
i
felt
as
if
i
could
have
looked
for
ever
on
that
quiet
and
peaceful
spot
when
we
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
had
turned
the
corner
a
broad
stone
bridge
confronted
us
on
the
other
side
of
this
was
an
country
inn
with
its
signboard
dangling
from
the
house
front
and
opposite
it
again
a
dilapidated
cottage
lolling
beside
two
iron
gates
the
gates
were
eight
feet
or
more
in
height
made
of
finely
wrought
iron
and
supported
by
big
stone
posts
on
the
top
of
which
two
stone
animals
griffins
i
believe
they
are
called
holding
shields
in
their
claws
looked
down
on
in
ferocious
grandeur
from
behind
the
gates
an
avenue
wound
and
disappeared
into
the
wood
without
consulting
me
my
old
charioteer
drove
into
the
inn
yard
and
having
thrown
the
reins
to
an
ostler
descended
from
the
vehicle
i
followed
his
example
and
then
inquired
the
name
of
the
place
inside
the
gates
my
guide
philosopher
and
friend
looked
at
me
rather
queerly
for
a
second
or
two
and
then
recollecting
that
i
was
a
stranger
to
the
place
said
that
be
the
hall
i
was
telling
about
that
where
sir
william
lives
then
that
where
my
father
was
born
he
nodded
his
head
and
as
he
did
so
i
noticed
that
the
ostler
stopped
his
work
of
unharnessing
the
horse
and
looked
at
me
in
rather
a
surprised
fashion
well
that
being
so
i
said
taking
my
stick
from
the
trap
and
preparing
to
stroll
off
i
just
going
to
investigate
a
bit
you
bring
yourself
to
an
anchor
in
yonder
and
do
stir
till
i
come
for
you
again
he
took
himself
into
the
inn
without
more
ado
and
i
crossed
the
road
towards
the
gates
they
were
locked
but
the
little
entrance
by
the
cottage
stood
open
and
passing
through
this
i
started
up
the
drive
it
was
a
perfect
afternoon
the
sunshine
straggled
in
through
the
leafy
canopy
overhead
and
danced
upon
my
path
to
the
right
were
the
thick
fastnesses
of
the
preserves
while
on
my
left
across
the
meadows
i
could
discern
the
sparkle
of
water
on
a
weir
i
must
have
proceeded
for
nearly
a
mile
through
the
wood
before
i
caught
sight
of
the
house
then
what
a
strange
experience
was
mine
leaving
the
shelter
of
the
trees
i
opened
on
to
as
beautiful
a
park
as
the
mind
of
man
could
imagine
a
herd
of
deer
were
grazing
quietly
just
before
me
a
woodman
was
eating
his
dinner
in
the
shadow
of
an
oak
but
it
was
not
upon
deer
or
woodman
that
i
looked
but
at
the
house
that
stared
at
me
across
the
undulating
sea
of
grass
it
was
a
noble
building
of
grey
stone
in
shape
almost
square
with
many
curious
buttresses
and
angles
the
drive
ran
up
to
it
with
a
grand
sweep
and
upon
the
green
that
fronted
it
some
big
trees
reared
their
stately
heads
in
my
time
i
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
stately
homes
of
england
but
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
set
eyes
on
one
and
to
think
that
this
was
my
father
birthplace
the
house
where
my
ancestors
had
lived
for
centuries
i
could
only
stand
and
stare
at
it
in
sheer
amazement
you
see
my
father
had
always
been
a
very
silent
man
and
though
he
used
sometimes
to
tell
us
yarns
about
scrapes
he
got
into
as
a
boy
and
how
his
father
was
a
very
stern
man
and
had
sent
him
to
a
public
school
because
his
tutor
found
him
unmanageable
we
never
thought
that
been
anything
very
much
to
tell
the
truth
i
felt
a
bit
doubtful
as
to
what
i
better
do
somehow
i
was
rather
nervous
about
going
up
to
the
house
and
introducing
myself
as
a
member
of
the
family
without
any
credentials
to
back
my
assertion
up
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
i
did
not
want
to
go
away
and
have
it
always
rankling
in
my
mind
that
i
seen
the
old
place
and
been
afraid
to
go
inside
my
mind
once
made
up
however
off
i
went
crossed
the
park
and
made
towards
the
front
door
on
nearer
approach
i
discovered
that
everything
showed
the
same
neglect
i
had
noticed
at
the
lodge
the
drive
was
overgrown
with
weeds
no
carriage
seemed
to
have
passed
along
it
for
ages
shutters
enclosed
many
of
the
windows
and
where
they
did
not
not
one
but
several
of
the
panes
were
broken
entering
the
great
stone
porch
in
which
it
would
have
been
possible
to
seat
a
score
of
people
i
pulled
the
antique
and
waited
while
the
peal
down
the
corridors
for
the
curtain
to
go
up
on
the
next
scene
presently
i
heard
footsteps
approaching
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
the
great
door
swung
open
an
old
man
whose
years
could
hardly
have
totalled
less
than
seventy
stood
before
me
dressed
in
a
suit
of
solemn
black
almost
green
with
age
he
inquired
my
business
in
a
wheezy
whisper
i
asked
if
sir
william
hatteras
were
at
home
informing
me
that
he
would
find
out
he
left
me
to
ruminate
on
the
queerness
of
my
position
in
five
minutes
or
so
he
returned
and
signed
to
me
to
follow
the
hall
was
in
keeping
with
the
outside
of
the
building
lofty
and
imposing
the
floor
was
of
oak
almost
black
with
age
the
walls
were
beautifully
wainscoted
and
carved
and
here
and
there
tall
armoured
figures
looked
down
upon
me
in
disdainful
silence
but
the
crowning
glory
of
all
was
the
magnificent
staircase
that
ran
up
from
the
centre
it
was
wide
enough
and
strong
enough
to
have
taken
a
coach
and
four
the
pillars
that
supported
it
were
exquisitely
carved
as
were
the
banisters
and
rails
up
was
a
sort
of
landing
from
which
again
the
stairs
branched
off
to
right
and
left
above
this
and
throwing
a
stream
of
coloured
light
down
into
the
hall
was
a
magnificent
window
and
on
a
lozenge
in
the
centre
of
it
the
arms
that
had
so
much
puzzled
me
on
the
gateway
a
nobler
hall
no
one
could
wish
to
possess
but
brooding
over
it
was
the
same
air
of
poverty
and
neglect
i
had
noticed
all
about
the
place
by
the
time
i
had
taken
in
these
things
my
guide
had
reached
a
door
at
the
farther
end
he
bade
me
enter
and
i
did
so
to
find
a
tall
elderly
man
of
stern
aspect
awaiting
my
coming
he
like
his
servant
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
with
the
exception
of
a
white
tie
which
gave
his
figure
a
appearance
his
face
was
long
and
somewhat
pinched
his
chin
and
upper
lip
were
shaven
and
his
whiskers
ran
in
two
straight
lines
from
his
jaw
up
to
a
level
with
his
piercing
eyes
he
would
probably
have
been
about
years
of
age
but
he
did
not
carry
it
well
in
a
low
monotonous
voice
he
bade
me
welcome
and
pointed
to
a
chair
himself
remaining
standing
my
servant
tells
me
you
say
your
name
is
hatteras
he
began
that
is
so
i
replied
my
father
was
james
dymoke
hatteras
he
looked
at
me
very
sternly
for
almost
a
minute
not
for
a
second
betraying
the
slightest
sign
of
surprise
then
putting
his
hands
together
finger
tip
to
finger
tip
as
i
discovered
later
was
his
invariable
habit
while
flunking
he
said
solemnly
james
was
my
younger
brother
he
misconducted
himself
gravely
in
england
and
was
sent
abroad
after
a
brief
career
of
spendthrift
extravagance
in
australia
we
never
heard
of
him
again
you
may
be
his
son
but
then
on
the
other
hand
of
course
you
may
not
i
have
no
means
of
judging
i
give
you
my
word
i
answered
a
little
nettled
by
his
speech
and
the
insinuation
contained
in
it
but
if
you
want
further
proof
i
got
a
latin
book
in
my
portmanteau
with
my
father
name
upon
the
and
an
inscription
in
his
own
writing
setting
forth
that
it
was
given
by
him
to
me
a
catullus
exactly
a
catullus
then
i
have
to
trouble
you
to
return
it
to
me
at
your
earliest
convenience
the
book
is
my
property
i
paid
eighteenpence
for
it
on
the
of
july
in
the
shop
of
john
burns
fleet
street
london
my
brother
took
it
from
me
a
week
later
and
i
have
not
been
able
to
afford
myself
another
copy
since
you
admit
then
that
the
book
is
evidence
of
my
father
identity
i
admit
nothing
what
do
you
want
with
me
what
do
you
come
here
for
you
must
see
for
yourself
that
i
am
too
poor
to
be
of
any
service
to
you
and
i
have
long
since
lost
any
public
interest
i
may
once
have
possessed
i
want
neither
one
nor
the
other
i
am
home
from
australia
on
a
trip
and
i
have
a
sufficient
competence
to
render
me
independent
of
any
one
ah
that
puts
a
different
complexion
on
the
matter
you
say
you
hail
from
australia
and
what
may
you
have
been
doing
there
pearling
trading
he
came
a
step
closer
and
as
he
did
so
i
noticed
that
his
face
had
assumed
a
look
of
indescribable
cunning
that
was
evidently
intended
to
be
of
an
ingratiating
nature
he
spoke
in
little
jerks
pressing
his
fingers
together
between
each
sentence
ah
and
pearling
well
well
and
you
have
been
fortunate
in
your
ventures
very
i
replied
having
by
this
time
determined
on
my
line
of
action
i
daresay
my
cheque
for
ten
thousand
pounds
would
not
be
dishonoured
ten
thousand
pounds
ten
thousand
pounds
dear
me
dear
me
he
shuffled
up
and
down
the
dingy
room
all
the
time
looking
at
me
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
as
if
to
make
sure
that
i
was
telling
him
the
truth
come
come
uncle
i
said
resolving
to
bring
him
to
his
bearings
without
further
waste
of
time
this
is
not
a
very
genial
welcome
well
well
you
must
expect
too
much
my
boy
you
see
for
yourself
the
position
i
in
the
old
place
is
shut
up
going
to
rack
and
ruin
poverty
is
staring
me
in
the
face
i
am
cheated
by
everybody
robbed
right
and
left
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
but
i
not
be
put
upon
they
may
call
me
what
they
please
but
they
ca
get
blood
out
of
a
stone
can
they
answer
me
that
now
this
speech
showed
me
everything
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
i
mean
of
course
the
reason
of
the
deserted
and
neglected
house
and
his
extraordinary
reception
of
myself
i
rose
to
my
feet
well
uncle
for
my
uncle
you
certainly
are
whatever
you
may
say
to
the
contrary
i
must
be
going
i
sorry
to
find
you
like
this
and
from
what
you
tell
me
i
could
think
of
worrying
you
with
my
society
i
want
to
see
the
old
church
and
have
a
talk
with
the
parson
and
then
i
shall
go
off
never
to
trouble
you
again
he
immediately
became
almost
fulsome
in
his
effort
to
detain
me
no
no
you
must
go
like
that
it
not
hospitable
besides
you
talk
with
parson
he
a
bad
lot
is
parson
a
hard
man
with
a
cruel
tongue
says
terrible
things
about
me
does
parson
but
i
be
even
with
him
yet
do
speak
to
him
laddie
for
the
honour
of
the
family
now
ye
stay
and
take
lunch
with
me
potluck
of
course
i
too
poor
to
give
ye
much
of
a
meal
and
in
the
meantime
i
show
ye
the
house
and
estate
this
was
just
what
i
wanted
though
i
did
not
look
forward
to
the
prospect
of
lunch
in
his
company
with
trembling
hands
he
took
down
an
hat
from
a
peg
and
turned
towards
the
door
when
we
had
passed
through
it
he
carefully
locked
it
and
dropped
the
key
into
his
breeches
pocket
then
he
led
the
way
upstairs
by
the
beautiful
oak
staircase
i
had
so
much
admired
on
entering
the
house
when
we
reached
the
first
landing
which
was
of
noble
proportions
and
must
have
contained
upon
its
walls
nearly
a
hundred
family
portraits
all
coated
with
the
dust
of
years
he
approached
a
door
and
threw
it
open
a
feeble
light
straggled
in
through
the
closed
shutters
and
revealed
an
almost
empty
room
in
the
centre
stood
a
large
canopied
bed
of
antique
design
the
walls
were
wainscoted
and
the
massive
was
carved
with
heraldic
designs
i
inquired
what
room
this
might
be
this
is
where
all
our
family
were
born
he
answered
was
here
your
father
first
saw
the
light
of
day
i
looked
at
it
with
a
new
interest
it
seemed
hard
to
believe
that
this
was
the
birthplace
of
my
own
father
the
man
whom
i
remembered
so
well
in
a
place
and
life
so
widely
different
my
companion
noticed
the
look
upon
my
face
and
i
suppose
felt
constrained
to
say
something
ah
james
he
said
sorrowfully
ye
were
always
a
giddy
roving
lad
i
remember
ye
well
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
to
brush
away
a
tear
i
thought
but
his
next
speech
disabused
me
of
any
such
notion
i
remember
that
but
a
day
or
two
before
ye
went
ye
blooded
my
nose
in
the
orchard
and
the
very
morning
ye
decamped
ye
borrowed
half
a
crown
of
me
and
never
paid
it
back
a
sudden
something
prompted
me
to
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
i
took
out
half
a
crown
and
handed
it
to
him
without
a
word
he
took
it
looked
at
it
longingly
put
it
in
his
pocket
took
it
out
again
ruminated
a
moment
and
then
reluctantly
handed
it
back
to
me
nay
nay
my
laddie
keep
your
money
keep
your
money
ye
can
send
me
the
catullus
then
to
himself
unconscious
that
he
was
speaking
his
thoughts
aloud
it
was
a
good
edition
and
i
have
no
doubt
would
bring
five
shillings
any
day
from
one
room
we
passed
into
another
and
yet
another
they
were
all
alike
shut
up
and
forsaken
and
yet
with
it
all
what
a
noble
place
it
was
one
which
any
man
might
be
proud
to
call
his
own
and
to
think
that
it
was
all
going
to
rack
and
ruin
because
of
the
miserly
nature
of
its
owner
in
the
course
of
our
ramble
i
discovered
that
he
kept
but
two
servants
the
old
man
who
had
admitted
me
to
his
presence
and
his
wife
who
as
that
peculiar
phrase
has
it
cooked
and
did
for
him
i
discovered
later
that
he
had
not
paid
either
of
them
wages
for
some
years
past
and
that
they
only
stayed
on
with
him
because
they
were
too
poor
and
proud
to
seek
shelter
elsewhere
when
we
had
inspected
the
house
we
left
it
by
a
side
door
and
crossed
a
courtyard
to
the
stables
there
the
desolation
was
perhaps
even
more
marked
than
in
the
house
the
great
clock
on
the
tower
above
the
main
building
had
stopped
at
a
quarter
to
ten
on
some
day
and
a
spider
now
ran
his
web
from
hand
to
hand
at
our
feet
between
the
stones
grass
grew
luxuriantly
thick
moss
covered
the
coping
of
the
well
the
doors
were
almost
off
their
hinges
and
rats
scuttled
through
the
empty
loose
boxes
at
our
approach
so
large
was
the
place
that
thirty
horses
might
have
found
a
lodging
comfortably
and
as
far
as
i
could
gather
there
was
room
for
half
as
many
vehicles
in
the
that
stood
on
either
side
the
intense
quiet
was
only
broken
by
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
in
the
giant
elms
overhead
the
squeaking
of
the
rats
and
the
low
grumbling
of
my
uncle
voice
as
he
pointed
out
the
ruin
that
was
creeping
over
everything
before
we
had
finished
our
inspection
it
was
lunch
time
and
we
returned
to
the
house
the
meal
was
served
in
the
same
room
in
which
i
had
made
my
relative
acquaintance
an
hour
before
it
consisted
i
discovered
of
two
meagre
mutton
chops
and
some
homemade
bread
and
cheese
plain
and
substantial
fare
enough
in
its
way
but
hardly
the
sort
one
would
expect
from
the
owner
of
such
a
house
for
a
beverage
water
was
placed
before
us
but
i
could
see
that
my
host
was
deliberating
as
to
whether
he
should
stretch
his
generosity
a
point
or
two
further
presently
he
rose
and
with
a
muttered
apology
left
the
room
to
return
five
minutes
later
carrying
a
small
bottle
carefully
in
his
hand
this
with
much
deliberation
and
sighing
he
opened
it
proved
to
be
claret
and
he
poured
out
a
glassful
for
me
as
i
was
not
prepared
for
so
much
liberality
i
thought
something
must
be
behind
it
and
in
this
i
was
not
mistaken
nephew
said
he
after
a
while
was
it
ten
thousand
pounds
you
mentioned
as
your
fortune
i
nodded
he
looked
at
me
slyly
and
cleared
his
throat
to
gain
time
for
reflection
then
seeing
that
i
had
emptied
my
glass
he
refilled
it
with
another
scarce
concealed
sigh
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
i
understand
you
to
say
you
are
quite
alone
in
the
world
my
boy
quite
until
i
met
you
this
morning
i
was
unaware
that
i
had
a
single
relative
on
earth
have
i
any
more
connections
not
a
soul
only
gwendoline
gwendoline
and
who
may
gwendoline
be
my
daughter
your
cousin
my
only
child
would
you
like
to
see
her
i
had
no
idea
you
had
a
daughter
of
course
i
should
like
to
see
her
he
left
the
table
and
rang
the
bell
the
ancient
answered
the
summons
tell
you
wife
to
bring
miss
gwendoline
to
us
miss
gwendoline
here
sir
you
do
not
mean
it
sir
numbskull
numbskull
numbskull
cried
the
old
fellow
in
an
ecstasy
of
fury
that
seemed
to
spring
up
as
suddenly
as
a
squall
does
between
the
islands
bring
her
or
i
be
the
death
of
you
without
further
remonstrance
the
old
man
left
the
room
and
i
demanded
an
explanation
good
servant
but
an
impudent
rascal
sir
he
said
of
course
you
must
see
my
daughter
my
beautiful
daughter
gwendoline
he
afraid
you
frighten
her
i
suppose
ha
ha
frighten
my
bashful
pretty
one
ha
ha
anything
so
supremely
devilish
as
the
mirth
of
this
old
fellow
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
his
very
laugh
seemed
as
if
it
had
to
crack
in
his
throat
before
it
could
pass
his
lips
what
would
his
daughter
be
like
living
in
such
a
house
with
such
companions
while
i
was
wondering
i
heard
footsteps
in
the
corridor
and
then
an
old
woman
entered
and
curtsied
respectfully
my
host
rose
and
went
over
to
the
fireplace
where
he
stood
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
the
same
devilish
grin
upon
his
face
well
where
is
my
daughter
sir
do
you
really
mean
it
of
course
i
mean
it
where
is
she
in
answer
the
old
lady
went
to
the
door
and
called
to
some
one
in
the
hall
come
in
dearie
it
all
right
come
in
now
that
a
little
dear
but
the
girl
made
no
sign
of
entering
and
at
last
the
old
woman
had
to
go
out
and
draw
her
in
and
then
but
i
hardly
know
how
to
write
it
how
shall
i
give
you
a
proper
description
of
the
that
entered
she
if
it
could
be
called
was
about
three
feet
high
dressed
in
a
shapeless
print
costume
her
hair
stood
and
hung
in
a
tangled
mass
upon
her
head
her
eyes
were
too
large
for
her
face
and
to
complete
the
horrible
effect
a
great
patch
of
beard
grew
on
one
cheek
and
descended
almost
to
a
level
with
her
chin
her
features
were
all
awry
and
now
and
again
she
uttered
little
moans
that
were
more
like
those
of
a
wild
beast
than
of
a
human
being
in
spite
of
the
old
woman
endeavours
to
make
her
do
so
she
would
not
venture
from
her
side
but
stood
slobbering
and
moaning
in
the
half
dark
of
the
doorway
it
was
a
ghastly
sight
one
that
nearly
turned
me
sick
with
loathing
but
the
worst
part
of
it
all
was
the
inhuman
merriment
of
her
father
there
there
he
cried
had
ever
man
such
a
lovely
daughter
she
a
beauty
is
she
fit
to
be
a
prince
bride
is
she
fit
to
be
the
heiress
of
all
this
place
wo
the
young
dukes
be
asking
her
hand
in
marriage
oh
you
beauty
you
but
there
take
her
away
take
her
away
i
say
before
i
do
her
mischief
the
words
had
no
sooner
left
his
mouth
than
the
old
woman
seized
her
charge
and
bundled
her
out
of
the
room
moaning
as
before
i
can
tell
you
there
was
at
least
one
person
in
that
apartment
who
was
heartily
glad
to
be
rid
of
her
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
them
my
host
came
back
to
his
seat
and
with
another
sigh
refilled
my
glass
i
wondered
what
was
coming
next
it
was
not
long
however
before
i
found
out
now
you
know
everything
he
said
you
have
seen
my
home
you
have
seen
my
poverty
and
you
have
seen
my
daughter
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
i
do
know
what
to
think
well
then
i
tell
you
that
child
wants
doctors
that
child
wants
proper
attendance
she
can
get
neither
here
i
am
too
poor
to
help
her
in
any
way
you
rich
by
your
own
telling
i
have
taken
you
into
the
bosom
of
my
family
recognized
you
without
doubting
your
assertions
will
you
help
me
will
you
give
me
one
thousand
pounds
towards
settling
that
child
in
life
with
that
amount
it
could
be
managed
will
i
what
i
cried
in
utter
amazement
dumbfounded
by
his
impudence
will
you
settle
one
thousand
pounds
upon
her
to
keep
her
out
of
her
grave
not
one
penny
i
cried
and
what
more
you
miserable
miserly
old
wretch
i
give
you
a
bit
of
my
mind
and
thereupon
i
did
such
a
talking
to
as
i
suppose
the
old
fellow
had
never
had
in
his
life
before
and
one
he
not
be
likely
to
forget
in
a
hurry
he
sat
all
the
time
white
with
fury
his
eyes
blazing
and
his
fingers
quivering
with
impotent
rage
when
i
had
done
he
ordered
me
out
of
his
house
i
took
him
at
his
word
seized
my
hat
and
strode
across
the
hall
through
the
front
door
and
out
into
the
open
air
but
i
was
not
to
leave
the
home
of
my
ancestors
without
a
parting
shot
as
i
closed
the
front
door
behind
me
i
heard
a
window
go
up
and
on
looking
round
there
was
the
old
fellow
shaking
his
fist
at
me
leave
my
house
leave
my
park
he
cried
in
a
shrill
falsetto
or
send
for
the
constable
to
turn
you
off
bah
you
came
to
steal
no
nephew
of
mine
i
disown
you
you
a
common
cheat
a
swindler
an
impostor
go
i
took
him
at
his
word
and
went
leaving
the
park
i
walked
straight
across
to
the
rectory
and
inquired
if
i
might
see
the
clergyman
to
him
i
told
my
tale
and
among
other
things
asked
if
anything
could
be
done
for
the
child
my
cousin
he
only
shook
his
head
i
fear
it
is
hopeless
hatteras
the
clergyman
said
the
old
gentleman
is
a
terrible
character
and
as
he
owns
half
the
village
and
every
acre
of
the
land
hereabouts
we
all
live
in
fear
and
trembling
of
him
we
have
no
shadow
of
a
claim
upon
the
child
and
unless
we
can
prove
that
he
actually
it
i
sorry
to
say
i
think
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
so
ended
my
first
meeting
with
my
father
family
from
the
rectory
i
returned
to
my
inn
what
should
i
do
now
london
was
worse
than
a
desert
to
me
now
that
my
sweetheart
was
gone
from
it
and
every
other
place
seemed
as
bad
then
an
advertisement
on
the
wall
of
the
bar
parlour
caught
my
eye
for
sale
or
hire
the
yacht
ten
tons
apply
screw
matchem
bournemouth
it
was
just
the
very
thing
i
was
pining
for
a
breath
of
sea
air
again
it
was
perfect
weather
for
a
cruise
i
would
go
to
bournemouth
inspect
the
yacht
at
once
and
if
she
suited
me
take
her
for
a
month
or
so
my
mind
once
made
up
i
hunted
up
my
jehu
and
set
off
for
the
train
never
dreaming
that
by
so
doing
i
was
taking
the
second
step
in
that
important
chain
of
events
that
was
to
affect
all
the
future
of
my
life
chapter
iv
i
save
an
important
life
i
travelled
to
bournemouth
by
a
fast
train
and
immediately
on
arrival
made
my
way
to
the
office
of
screw
matchem
with
a
view
to
instituting
inquiries
regarding
the
yacht
they
had
advertised
for
hire
it
was
with
the
senior
partner
i
transacted
my
business
a
shrewd
but
pleasant
gentleman
upon
my
making
known
my
business
to
him
he
brought
me
a
photograph
of
the
craft
in
question
and
certainly
a
nice
handy
boat
she
looked
she
had
been
built
he
went
on
to
inform
me
for
a
young
nobleman
who
had
made
two
very
considerable
excursions
in
her
before
he
had
been
compelled
to
fly
the
country
and
was
only
three
years
old
i
learned
also
that
she
was
lying
in
poole
harbour
but
he
was
good
enough
to
say
that
if
i
wished
to
see
her
she
should
be
brought
round
to
bournemouth
the
following
morning
when
i
could
inspect
her
at
my
leisure
as
this
arrangement
was
one
that
exactly
suited
me
i
closed
with
it
there
and
then
and
thanking
matchem
for
his
courtesy
betook
myself
to
my
hotel
having
dined
i
spent
the
evening
upon
the
pier
the
first
of
its
kind
i
had
ever
seen
listened
to
the
band
and
diverted
myself
with
thoughts
of
her
to
whom
i
had
plighted
my
troth
and
whose
unexpected
departure
from
england
had
been
such
a
sudden
and
bitter
disappointment
to
me
next
morning
faithful
to
promise
the
sailed
into
the
bay
and
came
to
an
anchor
within
a
biscuit
throw
of
the
pier
chartering
a
dinghy
i
pulled
myself
off
to
her
and
stepped
aboard
an
old
man
and
a
boy
were
engaged
washing
down
and
to
them
i
introduced
myself
and
business
then
for
half
an
hour
i
devoted
myself
to
overhauling
her
thoroughly
she
was
a
nice
enough
little
craft
well
set
up
and
from
her
run
looked
as
if
she
might
possess
a
fair
turn
of
speed
the
gear
was
in
excellent
order
and
this
was
accounted
for
when
the
old
man
told
me
she
had
been
repaired
and
thoroughly
overhauled
that
selfsame
year
having
satisfied
myself
on
a
few
other
minor
points
i
pulled
ashore
and
again
went
up
through
the
gardens
to
the
agents
office
matchem
was
delighted
to
hear
that
i
liked
the
yacht
well
enough
to
think
of
hiring
her
at
their
own
price
a
rather
excessive
one
i
must
admit
and
i
do
doubt
would
have
supplied
me
with
a
villa
in
bournemouth
and
a
yachting
box
in
the
isle
of
wight
also
on
their
own
terms
had
i
felt
inclined
to
furnish
them
with
the
necessary
order
but
fortunately
i
was
able
to
withstand
their
temptations
and
having
given
them
my
cheque
for
the
requisite
amount
went
off
to
make
arrangements
and
to
engage
a
crew
before
nightfall
i
had
secured
the
services
of
a
handy
lad
in
place
of
the
old
man
who
had
brought
the
boat
round
from
poole
and
was
in
a
position
to
put
to
sea
accordingly
next
morning
i
weighed
anchor
for
a
trip
round
the
isle
of
wight
before
we
had
brought
the
needles
abeam
i
had
convinced
myself
that
the
boat
was
an
excellent
sailer
and
when
the
first
day
cruise
was
over
i
had
no
reason
to
repent
having
hired
her
not
having
anything
to
hurry
me
and
only
a
small
boy
and
my
own
thoughts
to
keep
me
company
i
took
my
time
remained
two
days
in
the
solent
sailed
round
the
island
put
in
a
day
at
ventnor
and
so
back
to
bournemouth
then
after
a
day
ashore
i
picked
up
a
nice
breeze
and
ran
down
to
torquay
to
spend
another
week
sailing
slowly
back
along
the
coast
touching
at
various
ports
and
returning
eventually
to
the
place
i
had
first
hailed
from
in
relating
these
trifling
incidents
it
is
not
my
wish
to
bore
my
readers
but
to
work
up
gradually
to
that
strange
meeting
to
which
they
were
the
prelude
now
that
i
can
look
back
in
cold
blood
upon
the
circumstances
that
brought
it
about
and
reflect
how
narrowly
i
escaped
missing
the
one
event
which
was
destined
to
change
my
whole
life
i
can
hardly
realize
that
i
attached
such
small
importance
to
it
at
the
time
somehow
i
have
always
been
a
firm
believer
in
fate
and
indeed
it
would
be
strange
all
things
considered
if
i
were
not
for
when
a
man
has
passed
through
so
many
extraordinary
adventures
as
i
have
and
not
only
come
out
of
them
unharmed
but
happier
and
a
great
deal
more
fortunate
than
he
has
really
any
right
to
be
he
may
claim
the
privilege
i
think
of
saying
he
knows
something
about
his
subject
and
mind
you
i
date
it
all
back
to
that
visit
to
the
old
home
and
to
my
uncle
strange
reception
of
me
for
had
i
not
gone
down
into
the
country
i
should
never
have
quarrelled
with
him
and
if
i
had
not
quarrelled
with
him
i
should
not
have
gone
back
to
the
inn
in
such
a
dudgeon
and
in
that
case
i
should
probably
have
left
the
place
without
a
visit
to
the
bar
never
have
seen
the
advertisement
visited
bournemouth
hired
the
yacht
or
but
there
i
must
stop
you
must
work
out
the
rest
for
yourself
when
you
have
heard
my
story
the
morning
after
my
third
return
to
bournemouth
i
was
up
by
daybreak
and
had
my
breakfast
and
was
ready
to
set
off
on
a
cruise
across
the
bay
before
the
sun
was
a
hand
breadth
above
the
horizon
it
was
as
perfect
a
morning
as
any
man
could
wish
to
see
a
faint
breeze
just
blurred
the
surface
of
the
water
tiny
waves
danced
in
the
sunshine
and
my
barkie
nodded
to
them
as
if
she
were
anxious
to
be
off
the
town
ashore
lay
very
quiet
and
peaceful
and
so
still
was
the
air
that
the
cries
of
a
few
white
gulls
could
be
heard
quite
distinctly
though
they
were
half
a
mile
or
more
away
having
hove
anchor
we
tacked
slowly
across
the
bay
passed
the
and
steered
for
old
harry
rock
and
swanage
bay
my
crew
was
and
i
had
possession
of
the
tiller
as
we
went
about
between
canford
cliffs
and
alum
chine
something
moving
in
the
water
ahead
of
me
attracted
my
attention
we
were
too
far
off
to
make
out
exactly
what
it
might
be
and
it
was
not
until
five
minutes
later
when
we
were
close
abreast
of
it
that
i
discovered
it
to
be
a
bather
the
foolish
fellow
had
ventured
farther
out
than
was
prudent
had
struck
a
strong
current
and
was
now
being
washed
swiftly
out
to
sea
but
for
the
splashing
he
made
to
show
his
whereabouts
i
should
in
all
probability
not
have
seen
him
and
in
that
case
his
fate
would
have
been
sealed
as
it
was
when
we
came
up
with
him
he
was
quite
exhausted
heaving
my
craft
to
i
leapt
into
the
dinghy
and
pulled
towards
him
but
before
i
could
reach
the
spot
he
had
sunk
at
first
i
thought
he
was
gone
for
good
and
all
but
in
a
few
seconds
he
rose
again
then
grabbing
him
by
the
hair
i
passed
an
arm
under
each
of
his
and
dragged
him
unconscious
into
the
boat
in
less
than
three
minutes
we
were
alongside
the
yacht
again
and
with
my
crew
assistance
i
got
him
aboard
fortunately
a
day
or
two
before
i
had
had
the
forethought
to
purchase
some
brandy
for
use
in
case
of
need
and
my
thursday
island
experiences
having
taught
me
exactly
what
was
best
to
be
done
under
such
circumstances
it
was
not
long
before
i
had
brought
him
back
to
consciousness
in
appearance
he
was
a
handsome
young
fellow
well
set
up
and
possibly
nineteen
or
twenty
years
of
age
when
i
had
given
him
a
stiff
nobbler
of
brandy
to
stop
the
chattering
of
his
teeth
i
asked
him
how
he
came
to
be
so
far
from
shore
i
am
considered
a
very
good
swimmer
he
replied
and
often
come
out
as
far
as
this
but
i
think
i
must
have
got
into
a
strong
outward
current
and
certainly
but
for
your
providential
assistance
i
should
never
have
reached
home
alive
you
have
had
a
very
narrow
escape
i
answered
but
thank
goodness
you
none
the
worse
for
it
now
what
the
best
thing
to
be
done
turn
back
i
suppose
and
set
you
ashore
but
what
a
lot
of
trouble
i
putting
you
to
nonsense
i
nothing
to
do
and
i
count
myself
very
fortunate
in
having
been
able
to
render
you
this
small
assistance
the
breeze
is
freshening
and
it
wo
take
us
any
time
to
get
back
where
do
you
live
to
the
left
there
that
house
standing
back
upon
the
cliff
i
know
how
to
express
my
gratitude
just
keep
that
till
i
ask
you
for
it
and
now
as
we
got
a
twenty
minutes
sail
before
us
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
would
be
to
slip
into
a
spare
suit
of
my
things
they
keep
you
warm
and
you
can
return
them
to
my
hotel
when
you
get
ashore
i
sang
out
to
the
boy
to
come
aft
and
take
the
tiller
while
i
escorted
my
guest
below
into
the
little
box
of
a
cabin
and
gave
him
a
rig
out
considering
i
am
six
feet
two
and
he
was
only
five
feet
eight
the
things
were
a
trifle
large
for
him
but
when
he
was
dressed
i
help
thinking
what
a
handsome
young
fellow
he
was
the
work
of
fitting
him
out
accomplished
we
returned
to
the
deck
the
breeze
was
freshening
and
the
little
hooker
was
ploughing
her
way
through
it
nose
down
as
if
she
knew
that
under
the
circumstances
her
best
was
expected
of
her
are
you
a
stranger
in
bournemouth
my
companion
asked
as
i
took
the
tiller
again
almost
i
answered
i
only
been
in
england
three
weeks
i
home
from
australia
australia
really
oh
i
should
so
much
like
to
go
out
there
his
voice
was
very
soft
and
low
more
like
a
girl
than
a
boy
and
i
noticed
that
he
had
none
of
the
mannerisms
of
a
man
at
least
not
of
one
who
has
seen
much
of
the
world
yes
australia
as
good
a
place
as
any
other
for
the
man
who
goes
out
there
to
work
i
said
but
somehow
you
do
look
to
me
like
a
chap
that
is
used
to
what
is
called
roughing
it
pardon
my
bluntness
well
you
see
i
never
had
much
chance
my
father
is
considered
by
many
a
very
peculiar
man
he
has
strange
ideas
about
me
and
so
you
see
i
never
been
allowed
to
mix
with
other
people
but
i
stronger
than
you
think
and
i
shall
be
twenty
in
october
next
if
you
do
mind
telling
me
what
is
your
name
i
suppose
there
can
be
no
harm
in
letting
you
know
it
i
was
told
if
ever
i
met
any
one
and
they
asked
me
not
to
tell
them
but
since
you
saved
my
life
it
would
be
ungrateful
not
to
let
you
know
i
am
the
marquis
of
beckenham
is
that
so
then
your
father
is
the
duke
of
glenbarth
yes
do
you
know
him
never
set
eyes
on
him
in
my
life
but
i
heard
him
spoken
of
the
other
day
i
did
not
add
that
it
was
matchem
who
during
my
conversation
with
him
had
referred
to
his
grace
nor
did
i
think
it
well
to
say
that
he
had
designated
him
the
mad
duke
and
so
the
boy
i
had
saved
from
drowning
was
the
young
marquis
of
beckenham
well
i
was
moving
in
good
society
with
a
vengeance
this
boy
was
the
first
nobleman
i
had
ever
clapped
eyes
on
though
i
knew
the
count
de
panuroff
well
enough
in
thursday
island
but
then
foreign
counts
and
shady
ones
at
that
ought
not
to
reckon
perhaps
but
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
i
said
at
length
that
you
got
no
friends
do
you
ever
see
any
one
at
all
no
i
am
not
allowed
to
my
father
thinks
it
better
not
and
as
he
does
not
wish
it
of
course
i
have
nothing
left
but
to
obey
i
must
own
however
i
should
like
to
see
the
world
to
go
along
voyage
to
australia
for
instance
but
how
do
you
put
in
your
time
you
must
have
a
very
dull
life
of
it
oh
no
you
see
i
have
never
known
anything
else
and
then
i
have
always
the
future
to
look
forward
to
as
it
is
now
i
bathe
every
morning
i
have
my
yacht
i
ride
about
the
park
i
have
my
studies
and
i
have
a
tutor
who
tells
me
wonderful
stories
of
the
world
oh
your
tutor
has
been
about
has
he
dear
me
yes
he
was
a
missionary
in
the
south
sea
islands
and
has
seen
some
very
stirring
adventures
a
missionary
in
the
south
seas
eh
perhaps
i
know
him
were
you
ever
in
those
seas
why
i
spent
almost
all
my
life
there
were
you
a
missionary
you
bet
not
the
missionaries
and
my
friends
do
cotton
to
one
another
but
they
are
such
good
men
that
may
be
still
as
i
say
we
do
somehow
cotton
i
like
to
set
my
eyes
upon
your
tutor
well
you
will
i
think
i
see
him
on
the
beach
now
i
expect
he
has
been
wondering
what
has
become
of
me
i
never
been
out
so
long
before
well
you
close
home
now
and
as
safe
as
eggs
in
a
basket
another
minute
brought
us
into
as
shallow
water
as
i
cared
to
go
accordingly
heaving
to
i
brought
the
dinghy
alongside
and
we
got
into
her
then
casting
off
i
pulled
my
lord
ashore
a
small
man
with
the
regulation
white
choker
stood
by
the
water
waiting
for
us
as
i
beached
the
boat
he
came
forward
and
said
my
lord
we
have
been
very
anxious
about
you
we
feared
you
had
met
with
an
accident
i
have
been
very
nearly
drowned
baxter
had
it
not
been
for
this
gentleman
prompt
assistance
i
should
never
have
reached
home
again
you
should
really
be
more
careful
my
lord
i
have
warned
you
before
your
father
has
been
nearly
beside
himself
with
anxiety
about
you
eh
said
i
to
myself
somehow
this
does
not
sound
quite
right
anyhow
baxter
i
seen
your
somewhere
before
but
you
were
not
a
missionary
then
i
take
my
affidavit
turning
to
me
my
young
lord
held
out
his
hand
you
have
never
told
me
your
name
he
said
almost
reproachfully
dick
hatteras
i
answered
and
very
much
at
your
service
hatteras
i
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
done
for
me
that
i
am
most
grateful
to
you
i
hope
you
will
believe
i
know
that
i
owe
you
my
life
here
the
tutor
voice
chipped
in
again
as
i
thought
rather
impatiently
come
come
my
lord
this
delay
will
not
do
your
father
will
be
growing
still
more
nervous
about
you
we
must
be
getting
home
then
they
went
off
up
the
cliff
path
together
and
i
returned
to
my
boat
baxter
i
said
to
myself
again
as
i
pulled
off
to
the
yacht
i
want
to
know
where
i
seen
your
face
before
i
taken
a
sudden
dislike
to
you
i
do
trust
you
and
if
your
employer
the
man
they
say
he
is
well
he
wo
either
then
having
brought
the
dinghy
alongside
i
made
the
painter
fast
clambered
aboard
and
we
stood
out
of
the
bay
once
more
chapter
v
mystery
the
following
morning
i
was
sitting
in
my
room
at
the
hotel
idly
scanning
the
and
wondering
in
what
way
i
should
employ
myself
until
the
time
arrived
for
me
to
board
the
yacht
when
i
heard
a
carriage
roll
up
to
the
door
on
looking
out
i
discovered
a
gorgeous
landau
drawn
by
a
pair
of
fine
thoroughbreds
and
resplendent
with
much
gilded
and
crested
harness
standing
before
the
steps
a
footman
had
already
opened
the
door
and
i
was
at
the
window
just
in
time
to
see
a
tall
soldierly
man
alight
from
it
to
my
astonishment
two
minutes
later
a
waiter
entered
my
room
and
announced
his
grace
the
duke
of
glenbarth
it
was
the
owner
of
the
carriage
and
the
father
of
my
young
friend
if
by
such
a
title
i
might
designate
the
marquis
of
beckenham
hatteras
i
presume
said
he
yes
that
is
my
name
i
am
honoured
by
your
visit
wo
you
sit
down
thank
you
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
continued
hatteras
i
have
to
offer
you
an
apology
i
should
have
called
upon
you
yesterday
to
express
the
gratitude
i
feel
to
you
for
having
saved
the
life
of
my
son
but
i
was
unavoidably
prevented
i
beg
you
will
not
mention
it
i
said
his
lordship
thanked
me
sufficiently
himself
and
after
all
when
you
look
at
it
it
was
not
very
much
to
do
i
would
however
venture
one
little
suggestion
is
it
wise
to
let
him
swim
so
far
unaccompanied
by
a
boat
the
same
thing
might
happen
to
him
on
another
occasion
and
no
one
be
near
enough
to
render
him
any
assistance
he
will
not
attempt
so
much
again
he
has
learned
a
lesson
from
this
experience
and
now
hatteras
i
trust
you
will
forgive
what
i
am
about
to
say
my
son
has
told
me
that
you
have
just
arrived
in
england
from
australia
is
there
any
way
i
can
be
of
service
to
you
if
there
is
and
you
will
acquaint
me
with
it
you
will
be
conferring
a
great
favour
upon
me
i
thank
your
grace
i
replied
i
hope
with
some
little
touch
of
dignity
it
is
very
kind
of
you
but
i
could
not
think
of
such
a
thing
but
stay
there
is
one
service
perhaps
you
do
me
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
sir
and
what
may
it
be
your
son
tutor
baxter
his
face
is
strangely
familiar
to
me
i
have
seen
him
somewhere
before
but
i
can
not
recall
where
could
you
tell
me
anything
of
his
history
very
little
i
fear
save
that
he
seems
a
worthy
and
painstaking
man
an
excellent
scholar
and
very
capable
in
his
management
of
young
men
i
received
excellent
references
with
him
but
of
his
past
history
i
know
very
little
i
believe
however
that
he
was
a
missionary
in
the
south
seas
for
some
time
and
that
he
was
afterwards
for
many
years
in
india
i
sorry
i
can
not
tell
you
more
about
him
since
you
are
interested
in
him
i
met
him
somewhere
i
certain
his
face
haunts
me
but
to
return
to
your
son
i
hope
he
is
none
the
worse
for
his
adventure
not
at
all
thank
you
owing
to
the
system
i
have
adopted
in
his
education
the
lad
is
seldom
ailing
pardon
my
introducing
the
subject
but
do
you
think
it
is
quite
wise
to
keep
a
youth
so
ignorant
of
the
world
i
am
perhaps
rather
presumptuous
but
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
such
a
fine
young
fellow
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
few
companions
you
hit
me
on
rather
a
tender
spot
hatteras
but
as
you
have
been
frank
with
me
i
will
be
frank
with
you
i
am
one
of
those
strange
beings
who
govern
their
lives
by
theories
i
was
brought
up
by
my
father
i
must
tell
you
in
a
fashion
totally
different
from
that
i
am
employing
with
my
son
i
feel
now
that
i
was
allowed
a
dangerous
amount
of
license
and
what
was
the
result
i
mixed
with
every
one
was
pampered
and
flattered
far
beyond
what
was
good
for
me
derived
a
false
notion
of
my
own
importance
and
when
i
came
to
man
estate
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
quite
unprepared
and
unfitted
to
undertake
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
my
position
fortunately
i
had
the
wit
to
see
where
the
fault
lay
and
there
and
then
i
resolved
that
if
ever
i
were
blessed
with
a
son
i
would
conduct
his
education
on
far
different
lines
my
boy
has
not
met
a
dozen
strangers
in
his
life
his
education
has
been
my
tenderest
care
his
position
his
duties
towards
his
the
responsibilities
of
his
rank
have
always
been
kept
rigorously
before
him
he
has
been
brought
up
to
understand
that
to
be
a
duke
is
not
to
be
a
titled
nonentity
or
a
pampered
but
to
be
one
whom
providence
has
blessed
with
an
opportunity
of
benefiting
and
watching
over
the
welfare
of
those
less
fortunate
than
himself
in
the
world
good
gifts
he
has
no
exaggerated
idea
of
his
own
importance
a
humbler
lad
i
feel
justified
in
saying
you
would
nowhere
find
he
has
been
educated
thoroughly
and
he
has
all
the
best
traditions
of
his
race
kept
continually
before
his
eyes
but
you
must
not
imagine
hatteras
that
because
he
has
not
mixed
with
the
world
he
is
ignorant
of
its
temptations
he
may
not
have
come
into
personal
contact
with
them
but
he
has
been
warned
against
their
insidious
influences
and
i
shall
trust
to
his
personal
pride
and
good
instincts
to
help
him
to
withstand
them
when
he
has
to
encounter
them
himself
now
what
do
you
think
of
my
plan
for
making
a
nobleman
a
very
good
one
with
such
a
youth
as
your
son
i
should
think
your
grace
but
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
suggestion
if
you
would
allow
me
and
that
is
that
you
should
let
him
travel
before
he
settles
down
choose
some
fit
person
to
accompany
him
let
him
have
introductions
to
good
people
abroad
and
let
him
use
them
then
he
will
derive
different
impressions
from
different
countries
view
men
and
women
from
different
standpoints
and
enter
gradually
into
the
great
world
and
station
which
he
is
some
day
to
adorn
i
had
thought
of
that
myself
and
his
tutor
has
lately
spoken
to
me
a
good
deal
upon
the
subject
i
must
own
it
is
an
idea
that
commends
itself
strongly
to
me
i
will
think
it
over
and
now
sir
i
must
wish
you
you
will
not
let
me
thank
you
as
i
should
have
wished
for
the
service
you
have
rendered
my
house
but
believe
me
i
am
none
the
less
grateful
by
the
way
your
name
is
not
a
common
one
may
i
ask
if
you
have
any
relatives
in
this
county
only
one
at
present
i
fancy
my
father
brother
sir
william
hatteras
of
murdlestone
in
the
new
forest
ah
i
never
met
him
i
knew
his
brother
james
very
well
in
my
younger
days
but
he
got
into
sad
trouble
poor
fellow
and
was
obliged
to
fly
the
country
you
are
speaking
of
my
father
you
knew
him
knew
him
indeed
i
did
and
a
better
fellow
never
stepped
but
like
most
of
us
in
those
days
too
wild
much
too
wild
and
so
you
are
james
son
well
well
this
is
indeed
a
strange
coincidence
but
dear
me
i
am
forgetting
i
must
beg
your
pardon
for
speaking
so
candidly
of
your
father
no
offence
i
sure
and
pray
tell
me
where
my
old
friend
is
now
dead
your
grace
he
was
drowned
at
sea
the
worthy
old
gentleman
seemed
really
distressed
at
this
news
he
shook
his
head
and
i
heard
him
murmur
poor
jim
poor
jim
then
turning
to
me
again
he
took
my
hand
this
makes
our
bond
a
doubly
strong
one
you
must
let
me
see
more
of
you
how
long
do
you
propose
remaining
in
england
not
very
much
longer
i
fear
i
am
already
beginning
to
hunger
for
the
south
again
well
you
must
not
go
before
you
have
paid
us
a
visit
remember
we
shall
always
be
pleased
to
see
you
you
know
our
house
i
think
on
the
cliff
sir
so
saying
the
old
gentleman
accompanied
me
downstairs
to
his
carriage
and
shaking
me
warmly
by
the
hand
departed
again
i
had
cause
to
ponder
on
the
strangeness
of
the
fate
that
had
led
me
to
hampshire
first
to
the
village
where
my
father
was
born
and
then
to
bournemouth
where
by
saving
this
young
man
life
i
had
made
a
firm
friend
of
a
man
who
again
had
known
my
father
by
such
small
coincidences
are
the
currents
of
our
lives
diverted
that
same
afternoon
while
tacking
slowly
down
the
bay
i
met
the
marquis
he
was
pulling
himself
in
a
small
skiff
and
when
he
saw
me
he
made
haste
to
come
alongside
and
hitch
on
at
first
i
wondered
whether
it
would
not
be
against
his
father
wishes
that
he
should
enter
into
conversation
with
such
a
worldly
person
as
myself
but
he
evidently
saw
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
and
banished
all
doubts
by
saying
i
have
been
on
the
for
you
hatteras
my
father
has
given
me
permission
to
cultivate
your
acquaintance
if
you
will
allow
me
i
shall
be
very
pleased
i
answered
wo
you
come
aboard
and
have
a
chat
i
not
going
out
of
the
bay
this
afternoon
he
clambered
over
the
side
and
seated
himself
in
the
well
clear
of
the
boom
as
and
pleasant
a
young
fellow
as
any
man
could
wish
to
set
eyes
on
you
ca
imagine
how
i
been
thinking
over
all
you
told
me
the
other
day
he
began
when
we
were
fairly
on
our
way
i
want
you
to
tell
me
more
about
australia
and
the
life
you
lead
out
there
if
you
will
i
tell
you
all
i
can
with
pleasure
i
answered
but
you
ought
to
go
and
see
the
places
and
things
for
yourself
that
better
than
any
telling
i
wish
i
could
take
you
up
and
carry
you
off
with
me
now
away
down
to
where
you
can
make
out
the
green
islands
peeping
out
of
the
water
to
port
and
starboard
like
bits
of
the
garden
of
eden
gone
astray
and
floated
out
to
sea
i
like
you
to
smell
the
breezes
that
come
off
from
them
towards
evening
to
hear
the
whistling
overhead
and
the
thunder
of
the
surf
upon
the
reef
or
at
another
time
to
get
inside
that
selfsame
reef
and
look
down
through
the
still
transparent
water
at
the
fish
dashing
among
the
coral
boulders
in
and
out
of
the
most
beautiful
fairy
grottos
the
brain
of
man
can
conceive
oh
it
must
be
lovely
and
to
think
that
i
may
live
my
life
and
never
see
these
wonders
please
go
on
what
else
can
you
tell
me
what
more
do
you
want
to
hear
there
is
the
pick
of
every
sort
of
life
for
you
out
there
would
you
know
what
real
excitement
is
then
i
shall
take
you
to
a
new
gold
rush
to
begin
with
you
must
imagine
yourself
setting
off
for
the
field
with
your
trusty
mate
marching
step
by
step
beside
you
pick
and
shovel
on
your
shoulders
and
both
resolved
to
make
your
fortunes
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
when
you
get
there
the
digger
crowd
composed
of
every
nationality
there
the
warden
and
his
staff
the
police
officers
the
shanty
keepers
the
blacks
and
dogs
there
the
tented
valley
stretching
away
to
right
and
left
of
you
with
the
constant
roar
of
sluice
boxes
and
cradles
the
creak
of
windlasses
and
the
perpetual
noise
of
human
voices
there
the
excitement
of
pegging
out
your
claim
and
sinking
your
first
shaft
wondering
all
the
time
whether
it
will
turn
up
trumps
or
nothing
there
the
honest
manly
labour
from
dawn
to
dusk
and
then
when
daylight
fails
and
the
lamps
begin
to
sparkle
over
the
field
songs
drift
up
the
hillside
from
the
drinking
shanties
in
the
valley
and
you
and
your
mate
weigh
up
your
day
returns
and
having
done
so
turn
into
your
blankets
to
dream
of
the
monster
nugget
you
intend
to
find
upon
the
morrow
is
that
real
life
for
you
he
did
not
answer
but
there
was
a
sparkle
in
his
eyes
which
told
me
i
was
understood
then
if
you
want
other
sorts
of
enterprise
there
is
thursday
island
where
i
hail
from
with
its
extraordinary
people
let
us
suppose
ourselves
wandering
down
the
front
at
nightfall
past
the
kanaka
billiard
saloons
and
the
chinese
stores
into
say
the
of
all
who
is
that
handsome
dark
mysterious
fellow
smoking
a
cigarette
and
idly
flirting
with
the
pretty
bar
girl
do
know
him
but
i
do
there
indeed
a
history
for
you
you
did
notice
perhaps
that
rakish
schooner
that
came
to
anchor
in
the
bay
early
in
the
forenoon
what
lines
she
had
well
that
was
his
craft
she
be
gone
it
is
whispered
to
try
for
pearl
in
prohibited
dutch
waters
ca
you
imagine
her
slinking
round
the
islands
watching
for
the
patrolling
gunboat
and
ready
directly
she
has
passed
to
slip
into
the
bay
skim
it
of
its
shell
and
put
to
sea
again
sometimes
chased
what
then
well
a
clean
pair
of
heels
or
trouble
with
the
authorities
and
possibly
a
year
in
a
dutch
prison
before
you
brought
to
trial
or
would
you
do
a
pearling
trip
in
less
exciting
but
more
honest
fashion
would
you
ship
aboard
a
lugger
with
five
good
companions
and
go
down
the
new
guinea
coast
working
hard
all
day
long
and
lying
out
on
deck
at
night
smoking
and
listening
to
the
of
the
water
against
the
counter
or
spinning
yarns
of
all
the
world
what
else
why
what
more
do
you
want
do
you
hanker
after
a
cruise
aboard
a
stinking
boat
inside
the
barrier
reef
or
a
run
with
the
sandalwood
cutters
or
tortoiseshell
gatherers
to
new
guinea
or
do
you
want
to
go
ashore
again
and
try
an
overlanding
trip
half
across
the
continent
riding
behind
your
cattle
all
day
long
and
standing
your
watch
at
night
under
dripping
boughs
your
teeth
chattering
in
your
head
waiting
for
the
bulls
to
break
while
every
moment
you
expect
to
hear
the
bunyip
calling
in
that
lonely
beyond
the
fringe
of
mulga
scrub
you
make
me
almost
mad
with
longing
and
yet
somehow
it
does
seem
so
fine
when
you
at
it
it
when
you
come
to
look
back
upon
it
all
from
a
distance
of
twelve
thousand
miles
that
you
feel
its
real
charm
then
it
calls
to
you
to
return
in
every
rustle
of
the
leaves
ashore
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
above
in
the
ripple
of
the
waves
upon
the
beach
and
it
eats
into
your
heart
so
that
you
begin
to
think
you
will
never
be
happy
till
you
back
in
the
old
tumultuous
existence
again
what
a
life
you
led
and
how
much
more
to
be
envied
it
seems
than
the
dull
monotony
of
our
existence
here
in
sleepy
old
england
do
you
believe
it
if
you
wanted
to
change
i
could
tell
you
of
dozens
of
men
living
exactly
the
sort
of
life
i
described
who
would
only
too
willingly
oblige
you
no
no
believe
me
you
got
chances
of
doing
things
we
could
never
dream
of
do
them
then
and
let
the
other
go
but
all
the
same
i
think
you
ought
to
see
more
of
the
world
told
you
of
before
you
settle
down
in
fact
i
hinted
as
much
to
your
father
only
yesterday
he
said
that
you
had
spoken
of
it
to
him
oh
how
i
wish
he
would
let
me
go
somehow
know
i
think
he
will
i
put
the
cutter
over
on
another
tack
and
we
went
crashing
back
through
the
blue
water
towards
the
pier
the
strains
of
the
band
came
faintly
off
to
us
i
had
enjoyed
my
sail
for
i
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
this
bright
young
fellow
sitting
by
my
side
i
felt
i
should
like
to
have
finished
the
education
his
father
had
so
gallantly
begun
there
was
something
irresistibly
attractive
about
him
so
modest
so
unassuming
and
yet
so
straightforward
and
gentlemanly
dropping
him
opposite
the
bathing
machines
i
went
on
to
my
own
anchorage
on
the
other
side
of
the
pier
then
i
pulled
myself
ashore
and
went
up
to
the
town
i
had
forgotten
to
write
an
important
letter
that
morning
and
as
it
was
essential
that
the
business
should
be
attended
to
at
once
to
repair
my
carelessness
i
crossed
the
public
gardens
and
went
through
the
gardens
to
the
post
office
to
send
a
telegram
i
must
tell
you
here
that
since
my
meeting
with
baxter
the
young
marquis
tutor
i
had
been
thinking
a
great
deal
about
him
and
the
more
i
thought
the
more
certain
i
became
that
we
had
met
before
to
tell
the
truth
a
great
distrust
of
the
man
was
upon
me
it
was
one
of
those
peculiar
antipathies
that
no
one
can
explain
i
did
not
like
his
face
and
i
felt
sure
that
he
did
not
boast
any
too
much
love
for
me
as
my
thoughts
were
still
occupied
with
him
my
astonishment
may
be
imagined
on
arriving
at
the
building
at
meeting
him
face
to
face
upon
the
steps
he
seemed
much
put
out
at
seeing
me
and
hummed
and
hawed
over
his
for
all
the
world
as
if
i
had
caught
him
in
the
middle
of
some
guilty
action
returning
his
salutation
i
entered
the
building
and
looked
about
me
for
a
desk
at
which
to
write
my
wire
there
was
only
one
vacant
and
i
noticed
that
the
pencil
suspended
on
the
string
was
still
swinging
to
and
fro
as
it
had
been
dropped
now
baxter
had
only
just
left
the
building
so
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
that
it
was
he
who
had
last
used
the
stand
i
pulled
the
form
towards
me
and
prepared
to
write
but
as
i
did
so
i
noticed
that
the
previous
writer
had
pressed
so
hard
upon
his
pencil
that
he
had
left
the
exact
impression
of
his
message
plainly
visible
upon
the
pad
it
ran
as
follows
letter
received
you
ommitted
reveredn
the
train
is
laid
but
a
new
element
of
danger
has
arisen
it
was
addressed
to
nikola
sailor
east
india
dock
road
london
and
was
signed
nineveh
the
message
was
so
curious
that
i
looked
at
it
again
and
the
longer
i
looked
the
more
certain
i
became
that
baxter
was
the
sender
partly
because
its
wording
interested
me
and
partly
for
another
reason
which
will
become
apparent
later
on
i
inked
the
message
over
tore
it
from
the
pad
and
placed
it
carefully
in
my
one
thing
at
least
was
certain
and
that
was
if
baxter
the
sender
there
was
something
underhand
going
on
if
he
were
not
well
then
there
could
be
no
possible
harm
in
my
keeping
the
form
as
a
little
souvenir
of
a
rather
curious
experience
i
wrote
my
own
message
and
having
paid
for
it
left
the
office
but
i
was
not
destined
to
have
the
society
of
my
own
thoughts
for
long
hardly
had
i
reached
the
invalids
walk
before
i
felt
my
arm
touched
to
my
supreme
astonishment
i
found
myself
again
confronted
by
baxter
he
was
now
perfectly
calm
and
greeted
me
with
extraordinary
civility
hatteras
i
believe
he
said
i
think
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
on
the
sands
a
few
days
ago
what
a
beautiful
day
it
is
is
it
are
you
proceeding
this
way
yes
then
perhaps
i
may
be
permitted
the
honour
of
walking
a
short
distance
with
you
with
pleasure
i
replied
i
am
going
up
the
cliff
to
my
hotel
and
i
shall
be
glad
of
your
company
i
think
we
met
in
the
telegraph
office
just
now
in
the
post
office
i
think
i
had
occasion
to
go
in
there
to
register
a
letter
his
speech
struck
me
as
remarkable
my
observation
was
so
trivial
that
it
hardly
needed
an
answer
and
yet
not
only
did
he
vouchsafe
me
one
but
he
corrected
my
statement
and
volunteered
a
further
one
on
his
own
account
what
reason
could
he
have
for
wanting
to
make
me
understand
that
he
had
gone
in
there
to
post
a
letter
what
would
it
have
mattered
to
me
if
he
been
there
as
i
suggested
to
send
a
telegram
baxter
i
thought
to
myself
i
got
a
sort
of
conviction
that
you
not
the
man
you
pretend
to
be
and
what
more
i
like
to
bet
a
shilling
to
a
halfpenny
that
if
the
truth
were
only
known
you
our
mysterious
friend
nineveh
we
walked
for
some
distance
in
silence
presently
my
companion
began
to
talk
again
this
time
however
in
a
new
strain
and
perhaps
with
a
little
more
caution
you
have
been
a
great
traveller
i
understand
a
fairly
great
one
baxter
you
also
i
am
told
have
seen
something
of
the
world
a
little
very
little
the
south
seas
i
believe
know
papeete
i
have
been
there
know
new
guinea
at
all
no
i
was
never
near
it
i
am
better
acquainted
with
the
far
east
china
japan
etc
suddenly
something
i
shall
never
be
able
to
tell
what
prompted
me
to
say
and
the
andamans
the
effect
on
my
companion
was
as
sudden
as
it
was
extraordinary
for
a
moment
he
staggered
on
the
path
like
a
drunken
man
his
face
grew
ashen
pale
and
he
had
to
give
utterance
to
a
hoarse
choking
sound
before
he
could
get
out
a
word
then
he
said
no
no
you
are
quite
mistaken
i
assure
you
i
never
knew
the
andamans
now
on
the
andamans
as
all
the
world
knows
are
located
the
indian
penal
establishments
and
noting
his
behaviour
i
became
more
and
more
convinced
in
my
own
mind
that
there
was
some
mystery
about
baxter
that
had
yet
to
be
explained
i
had
still
a
trump
card
to
play
i
afraid
you
are
not
very
well
baxter
i
said
at
length
perhaps
the
heat
is
too
much
for
you
or
we
are
walking
too
fast
this
is
my
hotel
wo
you
come
inside
and
take
a
glass
of
wine
or
something
to
revive
you
he
nodded
his
head
eagerly
large
drops
of
perspiration
stood
on
his
forehead
and
i
saw
that
he
was
quite
unstrung
i
am
not
well
not
at
all
well
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
i
rang
for
two
brandies
and
sodas
when
they
arrived
he
drank
his
off
almost
at
a
gulp
and
in
a
few
seconds
was
pretty
well
himself
again
thank
you
for
your
kindness
hatteras
he
said
i
think
we
must
have
walked
up
the
hill
a
little
too
fast
for
my
strength
now
i
must
be
going
back
to
the
town
i
find
i
have
forgotten
something
almost
by
instinct
i
guessed
his
errand
he
was
going
to
despatch
another
telegram
resolved
to
try
the
effect
of
one
parting
shot
i
said
perhaps
you
do
not
happen
to
be
going
near
the
telegraph
office
again
if
you
are
should
i
be
taxing
your
kindness
too
much
if
i
asked
you
to
leave
a
message
there
for
me
i
find
have
forgotten
one
he
bowed
and
simply
said
with
much
pleasure
he
pronounced
it
pleesure
and
as
he
said
it
he
licked
his
lips
in
his
usual
fashion
i
wondered
how
he
would
conduct
himself
when
he
saw
the
message
i
was
going
to
write
taking
a
form
from
a
table
near
where
i
sat
i
wrote
the
following
john
nicholson
london
the
train
is
laid
but
a
new
danger
has
arisen
hatteras
blotting
it
carefully
i
gave
it
into
his
hands
at
the
same
time
asking
him
to
read
it
lest
my
writing
should
not
be
decipherable
and
any
question
might
be
asked
concerning
it
as
he
read
i
watched
his
face
intently
never
shall
i
forget
the
expression
that
swept
over
it
i
had
scored
a
complete
victory
the
shaft
went
home
but
only
for
an
instant
with
wonderful
alacrity
he
recovered
himself
and
shaking
me
feebly
by
the
hand
bade
me
promising
to
see
that
my
message
was
properly
delivered
when
he
had
gone
i
laid
myself
back
in
my
chair
for
a
good
think
the
situation
was
a
peculiar
one
in
every
way
if
he
were
up
to
some
devilry
i
had
probably
warned
him
if
not
why
had
he
betrayed
himself
so
openly
half
an
hour
later
an
answer
to
my
first
telegram
arrived
and
such
is
the
working
of
fate
it
necessitated
my
immediate
return
to
london
i
had
been
thinking
of
going
for
some
days
past
but
had
put
it
off
now
it
was
decided
for
me
as
i
did
not
know
whether
i
should
return
to
bournemouth
i
determined
to
call
upon
the
marquis
to
bid
him
accordingly
i
set
off
for
the
house
now
if
burke
may
be
believed
the
duke
of
glenbarth
possesses
houses
in
half
the
counties
of
the
kingdom
but
i
am
told
his
seaside
residence
takes
precedence
of
them
all
in
his
affections
standing
well
out
on
the
cliffs
it
commands
a
lovely
view
of
the
bay
looks
toward
the
purbeck
hills
on
the
right
and
the
isle
of
wight
and
hengistbury
head
on
the
left
the
house
itself
as
far
as
i
could
see
left
nothing
to
be
desired
and
the
grounds
had
been
beautified
in
the
highest
form
of
landscape
gardening
i
found
my
friend
and
his
father
in
a
upon
the
lawn
both
appeared
unaffectedly
glad
to
see
me
and
equally
sorry
to
hear
that
i
had
come
to
bid
them
good
bye
baxter
was
not
visible
and
it
was
with
no
little
surprise
i
learned
that
he
too
was
contemplating
a
trip
to
the
metropolis
i
hope
if
ever
you
visit
bournemouth
again
you
will
come
and
see
us
said
the
duke
as
i
rose
to
leave
thank
you
said
i
and
i
hope
if
ever
your
son
visits
australia
you
will
permit
me
to
be
of
some
service
to
him
you
are
very
kind
i
will
bear
your
offer
in
mind
shaking
hands
with
them
both
i
bade
them
and
went
out
through
the
gate
but
i
was
not
to
escape
without
an
interview
with
my
clerical
friend
after
all
as
i
left
the
grounds
and
turned
into
the
public
road
i
saw
a
man
emerge
from
a
little
wicket
gate
some
fifty
yards
or
so
further
down
the
hedge
from
the
way
he
made
his
appearance
it
was
obvious
he
had
been
waiting
for
me
to
leave
the
house
it
was
certainly
enough
my
old
friend
baxter
as
i
came
up
with
him
he
said
with
the
same
sanctimonious
grin
that
usually
encircled
his
mouth
playing
round
it
now
a
nice
evening
for
a
stroll
mr
hatteras
a
very
nice
evening
as
you
say
mr
baxter
may
i
intrude
myself
upon
your
privacy
for
five
minutes
with
pleasure
what
is
your
business
of
small
concern
to
you
sir
but
of
immense
importance
to
me
hatteras
i
have
it
in
my
mind
that
you
do
not
like
me
i
hope
i
have
not
given
you
cause
to
think
so
pray
what
can
have
put
such
a
notion
into
your
head
i
half
hoped
that
he
would
make
some
allusion
to
the
telegram
he
had
despatched
for
me
that
morning
but
he
was
far
too
cunning
for
that
he
looked
me
over
and
over
out
of
his
small
ferrety
eyes
before
he
replied
i
can
not
tell
you
why
i
think
so
hatteras
but
instinct
generally
makes
us
aware
when
we
are
not
quite
all
we
might
be
to
other
people
forgive
me
for
speaking
in
this
way
to
you
but
you
must
surely
see
how
much
it
means
to
me
to
be
on
good
terms
with
friends
of
my
family
you
are
surely
not
afraid
lest
i
should
prejudice
the
duke
against
you
not
afraid
hatteras
i
have
too
much
faith
in
your
sense
of
justice
to
believe
that
you
would
willingly
deprive
me
of
my
means
of
livelihood
for
of
course
that
is
what
it
would
mean
in
plain
english
then
you
need
have
no
fear
i
have
just
said
to
them
i
am
going
away
and
it
is
improbable
that
i
shall
ever
see
either
of
them
again
you
are
leaving
for
australia
very
shortly
i
think
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
generous
way
you
have
treated
me
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
pray
do
mention
it
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
to
me
then
mr
hatteras
he
turned
back
and
i
continued
my
way
along
the
cliff
reflecting
on
the
curious
interview
i
had
just
passed
through
if
the
truth
must
be
known
i
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
he
meant
by
it
why
had
he
asked
that
question
about
australia
was
it
only
chance
that
had
led
him
to
put
it
or
was
it
done
designedly
and
for
some
reason
connected
with
that
mysterious
train
mentioned
in
his
telegram
i
was
to
find
out
later
and
only
too
thoroughly
chapter
vi
i
meet
nikola
again
it
is
strange
with
what
ease
rapidity
and
apparent
unconsciousness
the
average
man
jumps
from
crisis
to
crisis
in
that
strange
medley
he
is
accustomed
so
flippantly
to
call
his
life
it
was
so
in
my
case
for
two
days
after
my
return
from
bournemouth
i
was
completely
immersed
in
the
toils
of
hatton
garden
had
no
thought
above
the
sale
of
pearls
and
the
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
shell
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
found
me
kicking
my
heels
on
the
pavement
of
trafalgar
square
my
mind
quite
made
up
my
passage
booked
and
my
ticket
for
australia
stowed
away
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
as
i
stood
there
the
grim
stone
faces
of
the
lions
above
me
were
somehow
seen
obscurely
nelson
monument
was
equally
unregarded
for
my
thoughts
were
far
away
with
my
mind
eye
following
an
ocean
as
she
threaded
her
tortuous
way
between
the
heads
and
along
the
placid
waters
of
sydney
harbour
so
wrapped
up
was
i
in
the
folds
of
this
agreeable
reverie
that
when
i
felt
a
heavy
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
heard
a
masculine
voice
say
joyfully
in
my
ear
dick
hatteras
or
i
a
dutchman
i
started
as
if
i
had
been
shot
brief
as
was
the
time
given
me
for
reflection
it
was
long
enough
for
that
voice
to
conjure
up
a
complete
scene
in
my
mind
the
last
time
i
had
heard
it
was
on
the
bridge
of
the
steamer
lying
in
the
harbour
of
cairns
on
the
eastern
queensland
coast
a
canoeful
of
darkies
were
jabbering
alongside
and
a
cargo
of
bananas
was
being
shipped
aboard
i
turned
and
held
out
my
hand
jim
percival
i
cried
with
as
much
pleasure
as
astonishment
how
on
earth
does
it
come
about
that
you
are
here
arrived
three
days
ago
the
young
fellow
replied
lying
in
the
river
just
off
the
west
india
docks
the
old
man
kept
us
at
it
like
galley
slaves
till
i
began
to
think
we
should
never
get
the
cargo
out
been
up
to
the
office
this
morning
coming
back
saw
you
standing
here
looking
as
if
you
were
thinking
of
something
ten
thousand
miles
away
i
tell
you
i
nearly
jumped
out
of
my
skin
with
astonishment
thought
there
could
be
two
men
with
the
same
face
and
build
so
smacked
you
on
the
back
discovered
i
was
right
and
here
we
are
now
spin
your
yarn
but
stay
let
first
find
a
more
convenient
place
than
this
we
strolled
down
the
strand
together
and
at
last
had
the
good
fortune
to
discover
a
house
of
call
that
met
with
even
his
critical
approval
here
i
narrated
as
much
of
my
doings
since
we
had
last
met
as
i
thought
would
satisfy
his
curiosity
my
meeting
with
that
mysterious
individual
at
the
french
restaurant
and
my
suspicions
of
baxter
particularly
amused
him
what
a
rum
beggar
you
are
to
be
sure
was
his
disconcerting
criticism
when
i
had
finished
what
earthly
reason
have
you
for
thinking
that
this
chap
baxter
has
any
designs
upon
your
young
swell
beckenham
or
whatever
his
name
may
be
what
makes
you
stand
by
to
shorten
sail
when
you
see
a
suspicious
look
about
the
sky
instinct
is
it
that
a
poor
way
out
of
the
argument
well
at
any
rate
time
will
show
how
far
i
right
or
wrong
though
i
do
suppose
i
shall
hear
any
more
of
the
affair
as
i
return
to
australia
in
the
on
friday
next
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
now
i
have
the
remotest
idea
my
business
is
completed
and
i
just
kicking
my
heels
in
idleness
till
friday
comes
and
it
is
time
for
me
to
set
off
then
i
have
it
you
just
come
along
down
to
the
docks
with
me
due
back
at
the
old
hooker
at
five
sharp
you
dine
with
us
pot
luck
of
course
your
old
friend
riley
is
still
chief
officer
i
second
young
cleary
whom
you
remember
as
apprentice
is
now
third
and
if
not
very
much
mistaken
we
find
old
donald
maclean
aboard
too
tinkering
away
at
his
beloved
engines
i
do
believe
that
fellow
could
take
a
holiday
away
from
his
thrust
blocks
and
piston
rods
if
he
were
paid
to
we
have
a
palaver
about
old
times
and
i
put
you
ashore
myself
when
you
want
to
go
there
what
do
you
say
i
your
man
said
i
jumping
at
his
offer
with
an
alacrity
which
must
have
been
flattering
to
him
the
truth
was
i
was
delighted
to
have
secured
some
sort
of
companionship
for
london
despite
its
multitudinous
places
of
amusement
and
its
five
millions
of
inhabitants
is
but
a
dismal
caravanserai
to
be
left
alone
in
moreover
the
officers
and
i
were
old
friends
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
my
heart
yearned
for
the
sight
of
a
ship
and
a
talk
about
days
gone
by
accordingly
we
made
our
way
to
the
docks
the
and
bearing
on
her
plates
evidences
of
the
continuous
life
she
had
led
lay
well
out
in
the
stream
having
chartered
a
waterman
we
were
put
on
board
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
renewing
my
acquaintance
with
the
chief
officer
riley
at
the
yawning
mouth
of
the
hatch
the
whilom
apprentice
cleary
now
raised
to
the
dignity
of
third
officer
grinned
a
welcome
to
me
from
among
the
disordered
raffle
of
the
head
while
that
excellent
artificer
maclean
and
spanner
in
hand
greeted
me
affectionately
in
gaelic
from
the
entrance
to
the
the
skipper
was
ashore
so
i
seated
myself
on
the
steps
leading
to
the
hurricane
deck
and
felt
at
home
immediately
upon
the
circumstances
attending
that
reunion
there
is
no
necessity
for
me
to
dwell
suffice
it
that
we
dined
in
the
deserted
saloon
and
adjourned
later
to
my
friend
percival
cabin
in
the
alley
way
just
of
the
where
several
bottles
of
scotch
whisky
a
strange
collection
of
glass
ware
and
an
assortment
of
excellent
cigars
were
produced
percival
and
cleary
being
the
juniors
ensconced
themselves
on
the
top
bunk
maclean
who
had
been
induced
to
abandon
his
machinery
in
honour
of
our
meeting
was
given
the
riley
took
the
cushioned
locker
in
the
corner
while
i
as
their
guest
was
permitted
the
luxury
of
a
deck
chair
the
initials
on
the
back
of
which
were
not
those
of
its
present
owner
at
first
the
conversation
was
circumscribed
and
embraced
plimsoll
the
attractions
of
london
and
the
decline
in
the
price
of
freight
but
as
the
contents
of
the
second
bottle
waned
speech
became
more
unfettered
and
the
talk
drifted
into
channels
and
latitudes
widely
different
circumstances
connected
with
bygone
days
were
recalled
the
faces
of
friends
long
hidden
in
the
mists
of
time
were
brought
again
to
mind
anecdotes
illustrative
of
various
types
of
maritime
character
succeeded
to
each
other
in
brisk
succession
till
maclean
without
warning
finding
his
voice
burst
into
incongruous
melody
one
song
suggested
another
a
banjo
was
produced
and
tuned
to
the
noise
of
clinking
glasses
and
every
moment
the
atmosphere
grew
thicker
how
long
this
concert
would
have
lasted
i
can
not
say
but
i
remember
after
the
third
repetition
of
the
chorus
of
the
that
might
have
been
heard
a
mile
away
glancing
at
my
watch
and
discovering
to
my
astonishment
that
it
was
past
ten
then
rising
to
my
feet
i
resisted
all
temptations
to
stay
the
night
and
reminded
my
friend
percival
of
his
promise
to
put
me
ashore
again
he
was
true
to
his
word
and
five
minutes
later
we
were
shoving
off
from
the
ship
side
amid
the
valedictions
of
my
hosts
i
have
a
recollection
to
this
day
of
the
face
of
the
chief
engineer
gazing
sadly
down
upon
me
from
the
bulwarks
while
his
quavering
voice
asserted
the
fact
in
dolorous
tones
that
aft
hae
i
rov
by
bonny
doon
to
see
the
rose
and
woodbine
twine
and
ilka
bird
sang
o
its
luve
and
fondly
sae
did
i
o
mine
with
this
amorous
farewell
still
ringing
in
my
ears
i
landed
at
limehouse
pier
and
bidding
my
friend
betook
myself
by
the
circuitous
route
of
emmett
and
ropemaker
streets
and
church
row
to
that
aristocratic
thoroughfare
known
as
the
east
india
dock
road
the
night
was
dark
and
a
thick
rain
was
falling
presenting
the
houses
muddy
road
and
pavements
in
an
aspect
that
was
even
more
depressing
than
was
usual
to
them
despite
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
the
lateness
of
the
hour
however
the
street
was
crowded
blackguard
men
and
women
such
a
class
as
i
had
never
in
all
my
experience
of
rough
folk
encountered
before
jostled
each
other
on
the
pavements
with
scant
ceremony
costermongers
cried
their
wares
small
boys
dashed
in
and
out
of
the
crowd
at
top
speed
and
flaring
gin
palaces
took
in
and
threw
out
continuous
streams
of
victims
for
some
minutes
i
stood
watching
this
melancholy
picture
contrasting
it
with
others
in
my
mind
then
turning
to
my
left
hand
i
pursued
my
way
in
the
direction
i
imagined
the
stepney
railway
station
to
lie
it
was
not
pleasant
walking
but
i
was
interested
in
the
life
about
me
the
people
the
shops
the
costermongers
barrows
and
i
might
even
say
the
i
had
not
made
my
way
more
than
a
hundred
yards
along
the
street
when
an
incident
occurred
that
was
destined
to
bring
with
it
a
train
of
highly
important
circumstances
as
i
crossed
the
entrance
to
a
small
side
street
the
door
of
an
tavern
was
suddenly
thrust
open
and
the
body
of
a
man
was
propelled
from
it
with
a
considerable
amount
of
violence
directly
into
my
arms
having
no
desire
to
act
as
his
support
i
pushed
him
from
me
and
as
i
did
so
glanced
at
the
door
through
which
he
had
come
upon
the
glass
was
a
picture
presumably
nautical
and
under
it
this
legend
the
green
sailor
in
a
flash
bournemouth
post
office
rose
before
my
mind
eye
the
startled
face
of
baxter
on
the
the
swinging
pencil
on
the
telegraph
stand
and
the
imprint
of
the
mysterious
message
addressed
to
nikola
sailor
east
india
dock
road
so
complete
was
my
astonishment
that
at
first
i
could
do
nothing
but
stand
stupidly
staring
at
it
then
my
curiosity
asserted
itself
and
seeking
the
private
entrance
i
stepped
inside
a
short
passage
conducted
me
to
a
small
and
room
abutting
on
the
bar
on
the
popular
side
of
the
counter
the
place
was
crowded
in
the
chamber
where
i
found
myself
i
was
the
sole
customer
a
small
table
stood
in
the
centre
and
round
this
two
or
three
chairs
were
ranged
while
several
pugnacious
prints
lent
an
air
of
decoration
to
the
walls
on
the
other
side
to
the
left
of
that
through
which
i
had
entered
a
curtained
doorway
hinted
at
a
similar
room
beyond
a
small
but
man
whom
i
rightly
judged
to
be
the
landlord
was
busily
engaged
with
an
assistant
dispensing
liquor
at
the
counter
but
when
i
rapped
upon
the
table
he
forsook
his
customers
and
came
to
learn
my
wishes
i
called
for
a
glass
of
whisky
and
seated
myself
at
the
table
preparatory
to
commencing
my
inquiries
as
to
the
existence
of
mysterious
friend
but
at
the
moment
that
i
was
putting
my
first
question
the
door
behind
the
curtain
which
must
have
been
insecurely
fastened
opened
about
an
inch
and
a
voice
greeted
my
ears
that
brought
me
up
all
standing
with
surprise
was
the
voice
of
baxter
i
assure
you
he
was
saying
it
was
desperate
work
from
beginning
to
end
and
i
was
never
so
relieved
in
my
life
as
when
i
discovered
that
he
had
really
come
to
say
at
this
juncture
one
of
them
must
have
realized
that
the
door
was
open
for
i
heard
some
one
rise
from
his
chair
and
come
towards
it
acting
under
the
influence
of
a
curiosity
which
was
as
baneful
to
himself
as
it
was
fortunate
for
me
before
closing
it
he
opened
the
door
wider
and
looked
into
the
room
where
i
sat
it
was
baxter
and
if
i
live
to
be
an
hundred
i
shall
not
forget
the
expression
on
his
face
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
me
mr
hatteras
he
gasped
clutching
at
the
wall
resolved
to
take
him
at
a
disadvantage
i
rushed
towards
him
and
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
at
the
same
time
noticing
that
he
had
discarded
his
clerical
costume
it
was
too
late
now
for
him
to
pretend
that
he
did
not
know
me
and
as
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
place
my
foot
against
it
it
was
equally
impossible
for
him
to
shut
the
door
seeing
this
he
felt
compelled
to
surrender
and
i
will
do
him
the
justice
to
admit
that
he
did
it
with
as
good
a
grace
as
possible
baxter
i
said
this
is
the
last
place
i
should
have
expected
to
meet
you
in
may
i
come
in
and
sit
down
without
giving
him
time
to
reply
i
entered
the
room
resolved
to
see
who
his
companion
might
be
of
course
in
my
own
mind
i
had
quite
settled
that
it
was
the
person
to
whom
he
had
telegraphed
from
bournemouth
in
other
words
nikola
but
who
was
nikola
and
had
i
ever
seen
him
before
my
curiosity
was
destined
to
be
satisfied
and
in
a
most
unexpected
fashion
for
there
sitting
at
the
table
a
cigarette
between
his
fingers
and
his
face
turned
towards
me
was
the
man
whom
i
had
seen
playing
chess
in
the
restaurant
the
man
who
had
told
me
my
name
by
the
cards
in
my
pocket
and
the
man
who
had
warned
me
in
such
a
mysterious
fashion
about
my
sweetheart
departure
he
was
correspondent
he
was
nikola
whatever
my
surprise
may
have
been
he
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
but
rose
calmly
from
his
seat
and
proffered
me
his
hand
saying
as
he
did
so
hatteras
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
and
still
more
pleased
to
learn
that
you
and
my
worthy
old
friend
baxter
have
met
before
wo
you
sit
down
i
seated
myself
on
a
chair
at
the
further
end
of
the
table
baxter
meanwhile
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
as
if
uncertain
whether
to
go
or
stay
presently
however
he
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
and
advancing
towards
nikola
said
with
an
earnestness
that
i
could
see
was
assumed
for
the
purpose
of
putting
me
off
the
scent
and
so
i
can
not
induce
you
nikola
to
fit
out
an
expedition
for
the
work
i
have
named
if
i
had
five
thousand
pounds
to
throw
away
replied
nikola
i
might
think
of
it
baxter
but
as
i
have
you
must
understand
that
it
is
impossible
then
seeing
that
the
other
was
anxious
to
be
going
he
continued
must
you
be
off
then
baxter
shook
hands
with
us
both
with
laboured
cordiality
and
having
done
so
slunk
from
the
room
when
the
door
closed
upon
him
nikola
turned
to
me
there
must
be
some
fascination
about
a
missionary
life
after
all
he
said
my
old
tutor
baxter
as
you
are
aware
has
a
comfortable
position
with
the
young
marquis
of
beckenham
which
if
he
conducts
himself
properly
may
lead
to
something
really
worth
having
in
the
future
and
yet
here
he
is
anxious
to
surrender
it
in
order
to
go
back
to
his
work
in
new
guinea
to
his
hard
life
insufficient
food
and
almost
certain
death
he
was
in
new
guinea
then
five
years
so
he
tells
me
are
you
certain
of
that
absolutely
then
all
i
can
say
is
that
in
spite
of
his
cloth
baxter
does
not
always
tell
the
truth
i
am
sorry
you
should
think
that
pray
what
reason
have
you
for
saying
so
simply
because
in
a
conversation
i
had
with
him
at
bournemouth
he
deliberately
informed
me
that
he
had
never
been
near
new
guinea
in
his
life
you
must
have
misunderstood
him
however
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
us
let
us
turn
to
a
pleasanter
subject
he
rang
the
bell
and
the
landlord
having
answered
it
ordered
more
refreshment
when
it
arrived
he
lit
another
cigarette
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
glanced
at
me
through
eyes
then
occurred
one
of
the
most
curious
and
weird
circumstances
connected
with
this
meeting
hardly
had
he
laid
himself
back
in
his
chair
before
i
heard
a
faint
scratching
against
the
table
leg
and
next
moment
an
enormous
cat
black
as
the
pit
of
tophet
sprang
with
a
bound
upon
the
table
and
stood
there
steadfastly
regarding
me
its
eyes
flashing
and
its
back
arched
i
have
seen
cats
without
number
chinese
persian
manx
the
australian
wild
cat
and
the
english
tabby
but
never
in
the
whole
course
of
my
existence
such
another
as
that
owned
by
nikola
when
it
had
regarded
me
with
its
evil
eyes
for
nearly
a
minute
it
stepped
daintily
across
to
its
master
and
rubbed
itself
backwards
and
forwards
against
his
arm
then
to
my
astonishment
it
clambered
up
on
to
his
shoulder
and
again
gave
me
the
benefit
of
its
fixed
attention
nikola
must
have
observed
the
amazement
depicted
in
my
face
for
he
smiled
in
a
curious
fashion
and
coaxing
the
beast
down
into
his
lap
fell
to
stroking
its
fur
with
his
long
white
fingers
it
was
as
uncanny
a
performance
as
ever
i
had
the
privilege
of
witnessing
and
so
hatteras
he
said
slowly
you
are
thinking
of
leaving
us
i
am
i
replied
with
a
little
start
of
natural
astonishment
but
how
did
you
know
it
after
the
conjuring
tricks
we
agreed
to
call
them
conjuring
tricks
i
think
i
showed
you
a
week
or
two
ago
i
wonder
that
you
should
ask
such
a
question
you
have
the
ticket
in
your
pocket
even
now
all
the
time
he
had
been
speaking
his
extraordinary
eyes
had
never
left
my
face
they
seemed
to
be
reading
my
very
soul
and
his
cat
ably
seconded
his
efforts
by
the
way
i
should
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
about
those
self
same
conjuring
tricks
i
said
do
you
know
you
gave
me
a
most
peculiar
warning
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
i
hope
you
profited
by
it
it
cost
me
a
good
deal
of
uneasiness
if
that
any
consolation
to
you
i
want
to
know
how
you
did
it
my
fame
as
a
wizard
would
soon
evaporate
if
i
revealed
my
methods
he
answered
still
looking
steadfastly
at
me
however
i
will
give
you
another
exhibition
of
my
powers
in
fact
another
warning
have
you
confidence
enough
in
me
to
accept
it
i
wait
and
see
what
it
is
first
i
replied
cautiously
trying
to
remove
my
eyes
from
his
well
my
warning
to
you
is
this
you
intend
to
sail
in
the
for
australia
on
friday
next
do
you
well
then
do
go
as
you
love
your
life
do
go
good
gracious
and
why
on
earth
not
i
cried
he
stared
fixedly
at
me
for
more
than
half
a
minute
before
he
answered
there
was
no
escaping
those
dreadful
eyes
and
the
regular
sweep
of
those
long
white
fingers
on
the
cat
black
fur
seemed
to
send
a
cold
shiver
right
down
my
spine
bit
by
bit
i
began
to
feel
a
curious
sensation
of
dizziness
creeping
over
me
because
you
will
go
you
can
not
go
i
forbid
you
to
go
i
roused
myself
with
an
effort
and
sprang
to
my
feet
crying
as
i
did
so
and
what
right
have
to
forbid
me
to
do
anything
i
go
on
friday
come
what
may
and
i
like
to
see
the
man
who
will
prevent
me
though
he
must
have
realized
that
his
attempt
to
hypnotize
me
for
attempt
it
certainly
was
had
proved
a
failure
he
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
my
dear
fellow
he
murmured
gently
knocking
off
the
ash
of
his
cigarette
against
the
table
edge
as
he
did
so
no
one
is
seeking
to
prevent
you
i
gave
you
at
your
own
request
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
admit
that
a
little
piece
of
advice
if
you
do
not
care
to
follow
it
that
is
your
concern
not
mine
but
pray
do
not
blame
me
must
you
really
go
now
then
and
for
i
do
suppose
i
shall
see
you
this
side
of
the
line
again
i
took
his
proffered
hand
and
wished
him
having
done
so
i
left
the
house
heartily
glad
to
have
said
to
the
only
man
in
my
life
whom
i
have
really
feared
when
in
the
train
on
my
way
back
to
town
i
came
to
review
the
meeting
in
the
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
a
series
of
problems
very
difficult
to
work
out
how
had
nikola
first
learned
my
name
how
had
he
heard
of
the
wetherells
was
he
the
mysterious
person
his
meeting
with
whom
had
driven
wetherell
out
of
england
why
had
baxter
telegraphed
to
him
that
the
train
was
laid
was
i
the
new
danger
that
had
arisen
how
had
baxter
come
to
be
at
the
in
costume
why
had
he
been
so
disturbed
at
my
entry
why
had
nikola
invented
such
a
lame
excuse
to
account
for
his
presence
there
why
had
he
warned
me
not
to
sail
in
the
and
above
all
why
had
he
resorted
to
hypnotism
to
secure
his
ends
i
asked
myself
these
questions
but
one
by
one
i
failed
to
answer
them
to
my
satisfaction
whatever
other
conclusion
i
might
have
come
to
however
one
thing
at
least
was
certain
that
was
that
my
original
supposition
was
a
correct
one
there
was
a
tremendous
mystery
somewhere
whether
or
not
i
was
to
lose
my
interest
in
it
after
friday
remained
to
be
seen
it
was
nearly
twelve
by
the
time
i
entered
my
hotel
but
late
as
it
was
i
found
time
to
examine
the
letter
rack
it
contained
two
envelopes
bearing
my
name
and
taking
them
out
i
carried
them
with
me
to
my
room
one
to
my
delight
bore
the
postmark
of
port
said
and
was
addressed
in
my
sweetheart
handwriting
you
may
guess
how
eagerly
i
tore
it
open
and
with
what
avidity
i
devoured
its
contents
from
it
i
gathered
that
they
had
arrived
at
the
entrance
of
the
suez
canal
safely
that
her
father
had
recovered
his
spirits
more
and
more
with
every
mile
that
separated
him
from
europe
he
was
now
almost
himself
again
she
said
but
still
refused
with
characteristic
determination
to
entertain
the
smallest
notion
of
myself
as
a
but
phyllis
herself
did
not
despair
of
being
able
to
talk
him
round
then
came
a
paragraph
which
struck
me
as
being
so
peculiar
as
to
warrant
my
reproducing
it
here
the
passengers
what
we
have
seen
of
them
appear
to
be
with
one
exception
a
nice
enough
set
of
people
that
exception
however
is
intolerable
his
name
is
prendergast
and
his
personal
appearance
is
as
objectionable
as
his
behaviour
is
extraordinary
his
hair
is
and
his
face
is
deeply
pitted
with
smallpox
this
is
of
course
not
his
fault
but
it
seems
somehow
to
aggravate
the
distaste
i
have
for
him
unfortunately
we
were
thrown
into
his
company
in
naples
and
since
then
the
creature
has
so
far
presumed
upon
that
introduction
that
he
scarcely
leaves
me
alone
for
a
moment
papa
does
not
seem
to
mind
him
so
much
but
i
thank
goodness
that
as
he
leaves
the
boat
in
port
said
the
rest
of
the
voyage
will
be
performed
without
him
the
remainder
of
the
letter
had
no
concern
for
any
one
but
myself
so
i
do
not
give
it
having
read
it
i
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
feeling
that
if
i
had
been
on
board
the
boat
i
should
in
all
probability
have
allowed
prendergast
to
understand
that
his
attentions
were
distasteful
and
not
in
the
least
required
if
i
could
only
have
foreseen
that
within
a
fortnight
i
was
to
be
enjoying
the
doubtful
pleasure
of
that
very
gentleman
society
under
circumstances
as
important
as
life
and
death
i
do
doubt
i
should
have
thought
still
more
strongly
on
the
subject
the
handwriting
of
the
second
envelope
was
bold
full
of
character
but
quite
unknown
to
me
i
opened
it
with
a
little
feeling
of
curiosity
and
glanced
at
the
signature
beckenham
it
ran
as
follows
west
cliff
bournemouth
tuesday
evening
my
dear
hatteras
i
have
great
and
wonderful
news
to
tell
you
this
week
has
proved
an
extraordinarily
eventful
one
for
me
for
what
do
you
think
my
father
has
suddenly
decided
that
i
shall
travel
all
the
details
have
been
settled
in
a
great
hurry
you
will
understand
this
when
i
tell
you
that
baxter
and
i
sail
for
sydney
in
the
steamship
next
week
my
father
telegraphed
to
baxter
who
is
in
london
to
book
our
passages
and
to
choose
our
cabins
this
morning
i
can
only
say
that
my
greatest
wish
is
that
you
were
coming
with
us
is
it
so
impossible
can
not
you
make
your
arrangements
fit
in
we
shall
travel
overland
to
naples
and
join
the
boat
there
this
is
baxter
proposition
and
you
may
be
sure
considering
what
i
shall
see
i
have
no
objection
to
urge
against
it
our
tour
will
be
an
extensive
one
we
visit
australia
and
new
zealand
go
thence
to
honolulu
thence
to
san
francisco
returning
across
the
united
states
canada
to
liverpool
you
may
imagine
how
excited
i
am
at
the
prospect
and
as
i
feel
that
i
owe
a
great
measure
of
my
good
fortune
to
you
i
want
to
be
the
first
to
acquaint
you
of
it
yours
ever
sincerely
beckenham
i
read
the
letter
through
a
second
time
and
then
sat
down
on
my
bed
to
think
it
out
one
thing
was
i
knew
now
how
nikola
had
become
aware
that
i
was
going
to
sail
in
the
mail
boat
on
friday
baxter
had
seen
my
name
in
the
passenger
list
and
had
informed
him
i
undressed
and
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
i
had
a
problem
to
work
out
and
a
more
than
usually
difficult
one
it
was
here
was
the
young
marquis
of
beckenham
i
told
myself
only
son
of
his
father
heir
to
a
great
name
and
enormous
estates
induced
to
travel
by
my
representations
there
was
a
conspiracy
afoot
in
which
i
could
not
help
feeling
certain
the
young
man
was
in
some
way
involved
and
yet
i
had
no
right
to
be
certain
about
it
after
all
for
my
suspicions
at
best
were
only
conjectures
now
the
question
was
whether
i
ought
to
warn
the
duke
or
not
if
i
did
i
might
be
frightening
him
without
cause
and
might
stop
his
son
journey
and
if
i
did
not
and
things
went
wrong
well
in
that
case
i
should
be
the
innocent
means
of
bringing
a
great
and
lasting
sorrow
upon
his
house
hour
after
hour
i
turned
this
question
over
and
over
in
my
mind
uncertain
how
to
act
the
clocks
chimed
their
monotonous
round
the
noises
died
down
and
rose
again
in
the
streets
and
daylight
found
me
only
just
come
to
a
decision
i
would
tell
them
but
at
the
same
time
i
would
make
doubly
sure
that
i
sailed
aboard
that
ship
myself
and
that
throughout
the
voyage
i
was
by
the
young
man
side
to
guard
him
from
breakfast
time
came
and
i
rose
from
my
bed
wearied
with
thought
even
a
bath
failed
to
restore
my
spirits
i
went
downstairs
and
crossing
the
hall
again
examined
the
rack
another
letter
awaited
me
i
passed
into
the
and
seating
myself
at
my
table
ordered
breakfast
having
done
so
i
turned
to
my
correspondence
fate
seemed
to
pursue
me
on
this
occasion
the
letter
was
from
the
lad
father
the
duke
of
glenbarth
himself
and
ran
as
follows
sandridge

wednesday
dear
hatteras
my
son
tells
me
he
has
acquainted
you
with
the
news
of
his
departure
for
australia
next
week
i
do
doubt
this
will
cause
you
some
little
surprise
but
it
has
been
brought
about
by
a
curious
combination
of
circumstances
two
days
ago
i
received
a
letter
from
my
old
friend
the
earl
of
amberley
who
as
you
know
has
for
the
past
few
years
been
governor
of
the
colony
of
new
south
wales
telling
me
that
his
term
of
office
will
expire
in
four
months
though
he
has
not
seen
my
boy
since
the
latter
was
two
years
old
i
am
anxious
that
he
should
be
at
the
head
of
affairs
when
he
visits
the
colony
hence
this
haste
i
should
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
have
accompanied
him
myself
but
business
of
the
utmost
importance
detains
me
in
england
i
am
however
sending
baxter
with
him
with
powerful
credentials
and
if
it
should
be
in
your
power
to
do
anything
to
assist
them
you
will
be
adding
materially
to
the
debt
of
gratitude
i
already
owe
you
believe
me
my
dear
hatteras
to
be
very
truly
yours
glenbarth
my
breakfast
finished
i
answered
both
these
letters
informed
my
friends
of
my
contemplated
departure
by
the
same
steamer
and
promised
that
i
would
do
all
that
lay
in
my
power
to
ensure
both
the
young
traveller
pleasure
and
his
safety
for
the
rest
of
the
morning
i
was
occupied
inditing
a
letter
to
my
sweetheart
informing
her
of
my
return
to
the
colonies
and
telling
her
all
my
adventures
since
her
departure
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
saying
to
the
few
business
friends
i
had
made
in
london
and
in
the
evening
i
went
for
the
last
time
to
a
theatre
five
minutes
to
eleven
next
morning
found
me
at
waterloo
sitting
in
a
compartment
of
the
west
of
england
express
bound
for
plymouth
and
australia
though
the
platform
was
crowded
to
excess
i
had
the
carriage
so
far
to
myself
and
was
about
to
congratulate
myself
on
my
good
fortune
when
a
porter
appeared
on
the
scene
and
deposited
a
bag
in
the
opposite
corner
a
moment
later
and
just
as
the
train
was
in
motion
a
man
jumped
in
the
carriage
tipped
the
servant
and
then
placed
a
basket
upon
the
rack
the
train
was
out
of
the
station
before
he
turned
round
and
my
suspicions
were
confirmed
was
nikola
though
he
must
have
known
who
his
companion
was
he
affected
great
surprise
hatteras
he
cried
i
think
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
coincidence
i
have
ever
experienced
in
my
life
why
so
i
asked
you
knew
i
was
going
to
plymouth
and
one
moment
reflection
must
have
told
you
that
as
my
boat
sails
at
eight
i
would
be
certain
to
take
the
morning
express
which
lands
me
there
at
five
should
i
be
indiscreet
if
i
asked
where
you
may
be
going
like
yourself
i
am
also
visiting
plymouth
he
answered
taking
the
basket
before
mentioned
down
from
the
rack
and
drawing
a
french
novel
from
his
coat
pocket
i
expect
an
old
indian
friend
home
by
the
mail
boat
that
arrives
i
am
going
down
to
meet
him
i
felt
relieved
to
hear
that
he
was
not
thinking
of
sailing
in
the
and
after
a
few
polite
commonplaces
we
both
lapsed
into
silence
i
was
too
suspicious
and
he
was
too
wary
to
appear
over
friendly
clapham
wimbledon
surbiton
came
and
went
weybridge
and
woking
flashed
by
at
lightning
speed
and
even
basingstoke
was
reached
before
we
spoke
again
that
station
behind
us
nikola
took
the
basket
before
mentioned
on
his
knee
and
opened
it
when
he
had
done
so
the
same
enormous
black
cat
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
in
the
east
india
dock
road
stepped
proudly
forth
in
the
daylight
the
brute
looked
even
larger
and
certainly
fiercer
than
before
i
felt
i
should
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
have
taken
it
by
the
tail
and
hurled
it
out
of
the
window
nikola
on
the
other
hand
seemed
to
entertain
for
it
the
most
extraordinary
affection
now
such
was
this
marvellous
man
power
of
fascination
that
by
the
time
we
reached
andover
junction
his
conversation
had
roused
me
quite
out
of
myself
had
made
me
forget
my
previous
distrust
of
him
and
enabled
me
to
tell
myself
that
this
railway
journey
was
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
i
had
ever
undertaken
in
salisbury
we
took
luncheon
baskets
on
board
with
two
bottles
of
champagne
for
which
my
companion
in
spite
of
my
vigorous
protest
would
insist
upon
paying
as
the
train
rolled
along
the
charming
valley
in
which
lie
the
miniature
towns
of
wilton
dinton
and
tisbury
we
pledged
each
other
in
right
good
fellowship
and
by
the
time
exeter
was
reached
were
friendly
enough
to
have
journeyed
round
the
world
together
exeter
behind
us
i
began
to
feel
drowsy
and
presently
was
fast
asleep
i
remember
no
more
of
that
journey
nor
indeed
have
i
any
recollection
of
anything
at
all
until
i
woke
up
in
room
no
of
the
and
vulture
in
plymouth
the
sunshine
was
streaming
in
through
the
slats
of
the
venetian
blinds
and
a
portly
gentleman
with
a
rosy
face
and
grey
hair
was
standing
by
my
bedside
holding
my
wrist
in
his
hand
and
calmly
scrutinizing
me
a
nurse
in
hospital
dress
stood
beside
him
i
think
he
do
now
he
said
to
her
as
he
rubbed
his
plump
hands
together
but
i
look
round
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
one
moment
i
said
feebly
for
i
found
i
was
too
weak
to
speak
above
a
whisper
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
i
am
and
what
is
the
matter
with
me
i
should
very
much
like
to
be
able
to
do
so
was
the
doctor
reply
my
opinion
is
if
you
want
me
to
be
candid
that
you
have
been
drugged
and
poisoned
by
a
remarkably
clever
chemist
but
what
the
drug
and
poison
were
and
who
administered
it
to
you
and
the
motive
for
doing
so
is
more
than
i
can
tell
you
from
what
i
can
learn
from
the
hotel
proprietors
you
were
brought
here
from
the
railway
station
in
a
cab
last
night
by
a
gentleman
who
happened
to
find
you
in
the
carriage
in
which
you
travelled
down
from
london
you
were
in
such
a
curious
condition
that
i
was
sent
for
and
this
nurse
procured
now
you
know
all
about
it
what
day
did
you
say
this
is
saturday
to
be
sure
saturday
i
cried
you
do
mean
that
then
by
jove
i
missed
the
after
all
here
let
me
get
up
and
tell
them
downstairs
to
send
for
the
inspector
of
police
i
have
got
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
i
sat
up
in
bed
but
was
only
too
glad
to
lie
down
i
looked
at
the
doctor
how
long
before
you
can
have
me
fit
to
travel
give
yourself
three
days
rest
and
quiet
he
replied
and
we
see
what
we
can
do
three
days
and
two
days
and
a
half
to
cross
the
continent
that
five
and
a
half
say
six
days
good
i
catch
the
boat
in
naples
and
then
nikola
if
you
aboard
as
i
suspect
i
advise
you
to
look
out
chapter
vii
port
said
and
what
befel
us
there
fortunately
for
me
my
arrangements
fitted
in
exactly
so
that
at
one
thirty
on
the
seventh
day
after
my
fatal
meeting
with
nikola
in
the
west
of
england
express
i
had
crossed
the
continent
and
stood
looking
out
on
the
blue
waters
of
naples
bay
to
my
right
was
the
hill
of
san
martino
behind
me
that
of
capo
di
monte
while
in
the
distance
to
the
southward
rose
the
summit
of
vesuvius
the
journey
from
london
is
generally
considered
i
believe
a
long
and
wearisome
one
it
certainly
proved
so
to
me
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
my
mind
was
impatient
of
every
delay
while
my
bodily
health
was
not
as
yet
recovered
the
first
thing
to
be
done
on
arrival
at
the
terminus
was
to
discover
a
quiet
hotel
a
place
where
i
could
rest
and
recoup
during
the
heat
of
the
day
and
what
was
perhaps
more
important
where
i
should
run
no
risk
of
meeting
with
nikola
or
his
satellites
i
had
originally
intended
calling
at
the
office
of
the
steamship
company
in
order
to
explain
the
reason
of
my
not
joining
the
boat
in
plymouth
planning
afterwards
to
cast
about
me
among
the
various
hotels
for
the
marquis
of
beckenham
and
baxter
but
on
second
thoughts
i
saw
the
wisdom
of
abandoning
both
these
courses
nor
for
the
same
reason
did
i
feel
inclined
to
board
the
steamer
which
i
could
see
lying
out
in
the
harbour
until
darkness
had
fallen
i
ascertained
however
that
she
was
due
to
sail
at
midnight
and
that
the
mails
were
already
being
got
aboard
almost
exactly
as
eight
was
striking
i
mounted
the
gangway
and
strolled
down
the
promenade
deck
to
the
first
saloon
entrance
then
calling
a
steward
to
my
assistance
i
had
my
baggage
conveyed
to
my
cabin
where
i
set
to
work
arranging
my
little
knicknacks
and
making
myself
comfortable
for
the
voyage
that
lay
before
us
so
far
i
had
seen
nothing
of
my
friends
and
on
making
inquiries
i
discovered
that
they
had
not
yet
come
aboard
indeed
they
did
not
do
so
until
the
last
boat
had
discharged
its
burden
at
the
gangway
then
i
met
lord
beckenham
on
the
promenade
deck
and
unaffected
was
the
young
man
delight
at
seeing
me
hatteras
he
cried
running
forward
to
greet
me
with
hand
this
was
all
that
was
wanting
to
make
my
happiness
complete
i
glad
to
see
you
i
hope
your
cabin
is
near
ours
i
on
the
port
side
just
abaft
the
pantry
i
answered
shaking
him
by
the
hand
but
tell
me
about
yourself
i
expect
you
had
a
pleasant
journey
across
the
continent
delightful
was
his
reply
we
stayed
a
day
in
paris
and
another
in
rome
and
since
we
have
been
here
we
have
been
rushing
about
seeing
everything
like
a
regulation
pair
of
british
tourists
at
this
moment
baxter
who
had
been
looking
after
the
luggage
i
suppose
made
his
appearance
and
greeted
me
with
more
cordiality
than
i
had
expected
him
to
show
to
my
intense
surprise
however
he
allowed
no
sign
of
astonishment
to
escape
him
at
my
having
joined
the
boat
after
all
but
a
few
minutes
later
as
we
were
approaching
the
companion
steps
he
said
i
understood
from
his
lordship
hatteras
that
you
were
to
embark
at
plymouth
was
i
mistaken
therefore
when
i
thought
i
saw
you
coming
off
with
your
luggage
this
evening
no
you
were
not
mistaken
i
answered
being
able
now
to
account
for
this
lack
of
surprise
i
came
across
the
continent
like
yourselves
and
only
joined
the
vessel
a
couple
of
hours
ago
here
the
marquis
chimed
in
and
diverted
the
conversation
into
another
channel
where
is
everybody
he
asked
when
baxter
had
left
us
and
gone
below
there
are
a
lot
of
names
on
the
passenger
list
and
yet
i
see
nobody
about
they
are
all
in
bed
i
answered
it
is
getting
late
you
see
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
shall
be
under
way
in
a
few
minutes
then
i
think
if
you
excuse
me
for
a
few
moments
i
go
below
to
my
cabin
i
expect
baxter
will
be
wondering
where
i
am
when
he
had
left
me
i
turned
to
the
bulwarks
and
stood
looking
across
the
water
at
the
gleaming
lights
ashore
one
by
one
the
boats
alongside
pushed
off
and
from
the
sounds
that
came
from
i
gathered
that
the
anchor
was
being
got
aboard
five
minutes
later
we
had
swung
round
to
our
course
and
were
facing
for
the
open
sea
for
the
first
mile
or
so
my
thoughts
chased
each
other
in
rapid
succession
you
must
remember
that
it
was
in
naples
i
had
learnt
that
my
darling
loved
me
and
it
was
in
naples
now
that
i
was
bidding
to
europe
and
to
all
the
strange
events
that
had
befallen
me
there
i
leant
upon
the
rail
looked
at
the
fast
receding
country
in
our
wake
at
old
vesuvius
away
to
port
at
the
great
bear
swinging
in
the
heavens
to
the
and
then
thought
of
the
southern
cross
which
before
many
weeks
were
passed
would
be
lifting
its
head
above
our
bows
to
welcome
me
back
to
the
sunny
land
and
to
the
girl
i
loved
so
well
somehow
i
felt
glad
that
the
trip
to
england
was
over
and
that
i
was
on
my
way
home
at
last
the
steamer
ploughed
her
almost
silent
course
and
of
an
hour
later
we
were
abreast
of
capri
as
i
was
looking
at
it
lord
beckenham
came
down
the
deck
and
stood
beside
me
his
first
speech
told
me
that
he
was
still
under
the
influence
of
his
excitement
indeed
he
spoke
in
rapturous
terms
of
the
enjoyment
he
expected
to
derive
from
his
tour
are
you
sure
you
will
be
a
good
sailor
i
asked
oh
i
have
no
fear
of
that
he
answered
confidently
as
you
know
i
have
been
out
in
my
boat
in
some
pretty
rough
weather
and
never
felt
in
the
least
ill
so
i
do
think
it
is
likely
that
i
shall
begin
to
be
a
bad
sailor
on
a
vessel
the
size
of
the
by
the
way
when
are
we
due
to
reach
port
said
next
thursday
afternoon
i
believe
if
all
goes
well
will
you
let
me
go
ashore
with
you
if
you
go
i
do
want
to
bother
you
but
after
all
you
have
told
me
about
the
place
i
should
like
to
see
it
in
your
company
i
take
you
with
pleasure
i
answered
provided
baxter
gives
his
consent
i
suppose
we
must
regard
him
as
skipper
oh
i
do
think
we
need
fear
his
refusing
he
is
very
you
know
and
lets
me
have
my
own
way
a
good
deal
where
is
he
now
down
below
asleep
he
has
had
a
lot
of
running
about
and
thought
he
would
turn
in
before
we
got
under
way
i
think
i
had
better
be
going
now
i
answered
and
he
left
me
again
when
i
was
alone
i
returned
to
my
thoughts
of
phyllis
and
the
future
and
as
soon
as
my
pipe
was
finished
went
below
to
my
bunk
my
berth
mate
i
had
discovered
earlier
in
the
evening
was
a
portly
english
merchant
of
the
old
school
who
was
visiting
his
agents
in
australia
and
from
the
violence
of
his
snores
i
should
judge
had
not
much
trouble
on
his
mind
fortunately
mine
was
the
lower
bunk
and
when
i
had
undressed
i
turned
into
it
to
sleep
like
a
top
until
roused
by
the
steward
at
seven
next
morning
after
a
good
bathe
i
went
back
to
my
cabin
and
set
to
work
to
dress
my
companion
by
this
time
was
awake
but
evidently
not
much
inclined
for
conversation
his
usual
jovial
face
it
struck
me
was
not
as
rosy
as
when
i
had
made
his
acquaintance
the
night
before
and
i
judged
that
his
good
spirits
were
more
than
half
assumed
all
this
time
a
smart
sea
was
running
and
i
must
own
the
was
rolling
abominably
a
very
good
morning
to
you
my
dear
sir
my
cabin
mate
said
with
an
air
of
enjoyment
his
pallid
face
belied
as
i
entered
the
berth
pray
how
do
you
feel
in
form
and
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
he
laid
himself
back
on
his
pillow
with
a
remark
that
sounded
very
much
like
oh
dear
and
thereafter
i
was
suffered
to
shave
and
complete
my
toilet
in
silence
having
done
so
i
put
on
my
cap
and
went
on
deck
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
morning
bright
sunshine
streamed
upon
the
decks
the
sea
was
a
perfect
blue
and
so
clear
was
the
air
that
miles
distant
though
it
was
from
us
the
italian
could
be
plainly
discerned
above
the
port
bulwarks
by
this
time
i
had
the
chief
steward
and
satisfied
myself
that
nikola
was
not
aboard
his
absence
puzzled
me
considerably
was
it
possible
that
i
could
have
been
mistaken
in
the
whole
affair
and
that
baxter
motives
were
honest
after
all
but
in
that
case
why
had
nikola
drugged
me
and
why
had
he
warned
me
against
sailing
in
the
the
better
to
think
it
out
i
set
myself
for
a
vigorous
tramp
round
the
hurricane
deck
and
was
still
revolving
the
matter
in
my
mind
when
on
turning
the
corner
by
the
entrance
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
baxter
himself
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
came
smiling
towards
me
holding
out
his
hand
hatteras
he
said
briskly
what
a
delightful
morning
it
is
to
be
sure
you
can
not
tell
how
much
i
am
enjoying
it
the
sea
air
seems
to
have
made
a
new
man
of
me
already
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
and
pray
how
is
your
charge
i
asked
more
puzzled
than
ever
by
this
display
of
affability
not
at
all
well
i
am
sorry
to
say
not
well
you
do
surely
mean
to
say
that
he
is
i
sorry
to
say
i
do
he
was
perfectly
well
until
he
got
out
of
his
bunk
half
an
hour
ago
then
a
sudden
but
violent
fit
of
nausea
seized
him
and
drove
him
back
to
bed
again
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
it
i
hope
he
will
be
better
soon
he
would
have
been
one
of
the
last
men
i
should
have
expected
to
be
bowled
over
are
you
coming
for
a
turn
round
i
shall
feel
honoured
he
answered
and
thereupon
we
set
off
step
for
step
for
a
constitutional
round
the
deck
by
the
time
we
had
finished
it
was
nine
and
the
saloon
gong
had
sounded
for
breakfast
the
meal
over
i
repaired
to
the
marquis
cabin
and
having
knocked
was
bidden
enter
i
found
my
lord
in
bed
retching
violently
his
complexion
was
the
colour
of
zinc
his
hands
were
cold
and
clammy
and
after
every
spasm
his
face
streamed
with
perspiration
i
am
indeed
sorry
to
see
you
like
this
i
said
bending
over
him
how
do
you
feel
now
very
bad
indeed
he
answered
with
a
groan
i
can
not
understand
it
at
all
before
i
got
out
of
bed
this
morning
i
felt
as
well
as
possible
then
baxter
was
kind
enough
to
bring
me
a
cup
of
coffee
and
within
five
minutes
of
drinking
it
i
was
obliged
to
go
back
to
bed
feeling
hopelessly
sick
and
miserable
well
you
must
try
and
get
round
as
soon
as
you
can
and
come
on
deck
there
a
splendid
breeze
blowing
and
you
find
that
will
clear
the
sickness
out
of
you
before
you
know
where
you
are
but
his
only
reply
was
another
awful
fit
of
sickness
that
made
as
if
it
would
tear
his
chest
asunder
while
he
was
under
the
influence
of
it
his
tutor
entered
and
set
about
ministering
to
him
with
a
care
and
fatherly
tenderness
that
even
deceived
me
i
can
see
things
more
plainly
now
on
looking
back
at
them
than
i
could
then
but
i
must
own
that
baxter
behaviour
towards
the
boy
that
morning
was
of
a
kind
that
would
have
hoodwinked
the
very
master
of
all
lies
himself
i
could
easily
understand
now
how
this
man
had
come
to
have
such
an
influence
over
the
duke
of
glenbarth
who
when
all
was
said
and
done
could
have
had
but
small
experience
of
men
of
baxter
type
seeing
that
instead
of
helping
i
was
only
in
the
way
i
expressed
a
hope
that
the
patient
would
soon
be
himself
again
and
returned
to
the
deck
luncheon
came
and
still
lord
beckenham
was
unable
to
leave
his
berth
in
the
evening
he
was
no
better
the
following
morning
he
was
if
anything
stronger
but
towards
just
as
he
was
thinking
of
getting
up
his
nausea
returned
upon
him
and
he
was
obliged
to
postpone
the
attempt
on
wednesday
there
was
no
improvement
and
indeed
it
was
not
until
thursday
afternoon
when
the
coast
of
port
said
was
showing
above
the
that
he
felt
in
any
way
fit
to
leave
his
bunk
in
all
my
experience
of
i
had
never
known
a
more
extraordinary
case
it
was
almost
dark
before
we
dropped
our
anchor
off
the
town
and
as
soon
as
we
were
at
a
standstill
i
went
below
to
my
friend
cabin
he
was
sitting
on
the
locker
fully
dressed
port
said
i
announced
now
how
do
you
feel
about
going
ashore
personally
i
do
think
you
had
better
try
it
oh
but
i
want
to
go
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
it
so
much
i
am
much
stronger
than
i
was
believe
me
and
baxter
does
think
it
could
possibly
hurt
me
if
you
do
tire
yourself
too
much
that
gentleman
put
in
very
well
then
i
said
in
that
case
i
your
man
there
are
plenty
of
boats
alongside
so
we
have
no
difficulty
about
getting
there
wo
you
come
too
mr
baxter
i
think
not
thank
you
he
answered
port
said
is
not
a
place
of
which
i
am
very
fond
in
that
case
i
think
we
had
better
be
going
i
said
turning
to
his
lordship
we
made
our
way
on
deck
and
after
a
little
chaffering
secured
a
boat
in
which
we
were
pulled
ashore
having
arrived
there
we
were
immediately
beset
by
the
usual
crowd
of
beggars
and
donkey
boys
but
withstanding
their
importunities
we
turned
into
the
rue
de
commerce
and
made
our
way
inland
to
my
companion
the
crowded
streets
the
diversity
of
nationalities
and
costume
and
the
strange
variety
of
shops
and
wares
were
matters
of
absorbing
interest
this
will
be
the
better
understood
when
it
is
remembered
that
poor
though
port
said
is
in
orientalism
it
was
nevertheless
the
first
eastern
port
he
had
encountered
we
had
both
a
few
purchases
to
make
and
this
business
satisfactorily
accomplished
we
started
off
to
see
the
sights
passing
out
of
the
rue
de
commerce
our
attention
was
attracted
by
a
lame
young
beggar
who
leaning
on
his
crutches
blocked
our
way
while
he
recited
his
dismal
catalogue
of
woes
our
guide
bade
him
be
off
and
indeed
i
was
not
sorry
to
be
rid
of
him
but
i
could
see
by
glancing
at
his
face
that
my
companion
had
taken
his
case
more
seriously
in
fact
we
had
not
proceeded
more
than
twenty
yards
before
he
asked
me
to
wait
a
moment
for
him
and
taking
to
his
heels
ran
back
to
the
spot
where
we
had
left
him
when
he
rejoined
us
i
said
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
gave
that
rascal
money
only
half
a
sovereign
he
answered
perhaps
you
did
hear
the
pitiful
story
he
told
us
his
father
is
dead
and
now
if
it
were
not
for
his
begging
his
mother
and
five
young
sisters
would
all
be
starving
i
asked
our
guide
if
he
knew
the
man
and
whether
his
tale
were
true
no
monsieur
he
replied
promptly
it
is
all
one
big
lie
his
father
is
in
the
jail
and
if
she
had
her
rights
his
mother
would
be
there
too
not
another
word
was
said
on
the
subject
but
i
could
see
that
the
generous
heart
had
been
hurt
how
little
he
guessed
the
effect
that
outburst
of
generosity
was
to
have
upon
us
later
on
at
our
guide
suggestion
we
passed
from
the
commercial
through
the
european
quarter
to
a
large
mosque
situated
in
arab
town
it
was
a
long
walk
but
we
were
promised
that
we
should
see
something
there
that
would
amply
compensate
us
for
any
trouble
we
might
be
put
to
to
reach
it
this
turned
out
to
be
the
case
but
hardly
in
the
fashion
he
had
predicted
the
mosque
was
certainly
a
fine
building
and
at
the
time
of
our
visit
was
thronged
with
worshippers
they
knelt
in
two
long
lines
reaching
from
end
to
end
their
feet
were
bare
and
their
heads
turned
towards
the
east
by
our
guide
instructions
we
removed
our
boots
at
the
entrance
but
fortunately
took
the
precaution
of
carrying
them
into
the
building
with
us
from
the
main
hall
we
passed
into
a
smaller
one
where
a
number
of
egyptian
standards
relics
of
the
war
of
were
unrolled
for
our
inspection
while
we
were
examining
them
our
guide
who
had
for
a
moment
left
us
returned
with
a
scared
face
to
inform
us
that
there
were
a
number
of
english
tourists
in
the
mosque
who
had
refused
to
take
their
boots
off
and
were
evidently
bent
on
making
trouble
as
he
spoke
the
ominous
hum
of
angry
voices
drifted
in
to
us
increasing
in
volume
as
we
listened
our
guide
pricked
up
his
ears
and
looked
anxiously
at
the
door
there
will
be
trouble
directly
he
said
solemnly
if
those
young
men
do
not
behave
themselves
if
messieurs
will
be
guided
by
me
they
will
be
going
i
can
show
them
a
backway
out
for
a
moment
i
felt
inclined
to
follow
his
advice
but
beckenham
next
speech
decided
me
to
stay
you
will
not
go
away
and
leave
those
stupid
fellows
to
be
killed
he
said
moving
towards
the
door
into
the
mosque
proper
however
foolish
they
may
have
been
they
are
still
our
countrymen
and
whatever
happens
we
ought
to
stand
by
them
if
you
think
so
of
course
we
will
but
remember
it
may
cost
us
our
lives
you
still
want
to
stay
very
good
then
come
along
but
stick
close
to
me
we
left
the
small
in
which
we
had
been
examining
the
flags
and
passed
back
into
the
main
hall
here
an
extraordinary
scene
presented
itself
in
the
furthest
corner
completely
hemmed
in
by
a
crowd
of
furious
arabs
were
three
young
englishmen
whose
faces
plainly
showed
how
well
they
understood
the
dangerous
position
into
which
their
own
impudence
and
folly
had
enticed
them
elbowing
our
way
through
the
crowd
we
reached
their
side
and
immediately
called
upon
them
to
push
their
way
towards
the
big
doors
but
before
this
man
oe
uvre
could
be
executed
some
one
had
given
an
order
in
arabic
and
we
were
all
borne
back
against
the
wall
there
is
no
help
for
it
i
cried
to
the
biggest
of
the
strangers
we
must
fight
our
way
out
choose
your
men
and
come
along
so
saying
i
gave
the
man
nearest
me
one
under
the
jaw
to
remember
me
by
which
laid
him
on
his
back
and
then
having
room
to
use
my
arms
sent
down
another
to
keep
him
company
all
this
time
my
companions
were
not
idle
and
to
my
surprise
i
saw
the
young
marquis
laying
about
him
with
a
science
that
i
had
to
own
afterwards
did
credit
to
his
education
our
assailants
evidently
did
not
expect
to
meet
with
this
resistance
for
they
gave
way
and
began
to
back
towards
the
door
one
or
two
of
them
drew
knives
but
the
space
was
too
cramped
for
them
to
do
much
harm
with
them
one
more
rush
i
cried
and
we
turn
them
out
we
made
the
rush
and
next
moment
the
doors
were
closed
and
barred
on
the
last
of
them
this
done
we
paused
to
consider
our
position
true
we
had
driven
the
enemy
from
the
citadel
but
then
unless
we
could
find
a
means
of
escape
we
ourselves
were
equally
prisoners
in
it
what
was
to
be
done
leaving
three
of
our
party
to
guard
the
doors
the
remainder
searched
the
adjoining
rooms
for
a
means
of
escape
but
though
we
were
unsuccessful
in
our
attempt
to
find
an
exit
we
did
what
was
the
next
best
thing
to
do
discovered
our
cowardly
guide
in
a
corner
skulking
in
a
curious
sort
of
cupboard
by
the
time
we
had
proved
to
him
that
the
enemy
were
really
driven
out
and
that
we
had
possession
of
the
mosque
he
recovered
his
wits
a
little
and
managed
after
hearing
our
promise
to
throw
him
to
the
mob
outside
unless
he
discovered
a
means
of
escape
for
us
to
cudgel
his
brains
and
announce
that
he
knew
of
one
no
sooner
did
we
hear
this
than
we
resolved
to
profit
by
it
the
mob
outside
was
growing
every
moment
more
impatient
and
from
the
clang
of
rifle
butts
on
the
stone
steps
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
services
of
a
force
of
soldiery
had
been
called
in
the
situation
was
critical
and
twice
imperious
demands
were
made
upon
us
to
open
the
door
but
as
may
be
supposed
this
we
did
not
feel
inclined
to
do
now
for
your
way
out
i
said
taking
our
trembling
guide
whose
face
seemed
to
blanch
whiter
and
whiter
with
every
knock
upon
the
door
by
the
shoulders
and
giving
him
a
preliminary
shake
mind
what
about
and
remember
if
you
lead
us
into
any
trap
i
wring
your
miserable
neck
assure
as
you
alive
go
ahead
collecting
our
boots
and
shoes
which
throughout
the
tumult
had
been
lying
scattered
about
upon
the
floor
we
passed
into
the
and
put
them
on
then
creeping
softly
out
by
another
door
we
reached
a
small
courtyard
in
the
rear
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
high
walls
our
way
so
our
guide
informed
us
lay
over
one
of
these
but
how
we
were
to
surmount
them
was
a
puzzle
for
the
lowest
scaling
place
was
at
least
twelve
feet
high
however
the
business
had
to
be
done
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
done
quickly
calling
the
strongest
of
the
tourists
who
were
by
this
time
all
quite
sober
to
my
side
i
bade
him
stoop
down
as
if
he
were
playing
then
mounting
his
back
myself
i
stood
upright
and
stretched
my
arms
above
my
head
to
my
delight
my
fingers
reached
to
within
a
few
inches
of
the
top
of
the
wall
stand
as
steady
as
you
can
i
whispered
for
i
going
to
jump
i
did
so
and
clutched
the
edge
when
i
had
pulled
myself
to
the
top
i
was
so
completely
exhausted
as
to
be
unable
to
do
anything
for
more
than
a
minute
then
i
whispered
to
another
man
to
climb
upon
the
first
back
and
stretch
his
hands
up
to
mine
he
did
so
and
i
pulled
him
up
beside
me
the
guide
came
next
then
the
other
tourist
then
lord
beckenham
after
which
i
took
off
and
lowered
my
coat
to
the
man
who
had
stood
for
us
all
and
having
done
so
took
a
firm
grip
of
the
wall
with
my
legs
and
dragged
him
up
as
i
had
done
the
others
it
had
been
a
longer
business
than
i
liked
and
every
moment
while
we
were
about
it
i
expected
to
hear
the
cries
of
the
mob
inside
the
mosque
and
to
find
them
pouring
into
the
yard
to
prevent
our
escape
the
bolts
on
the
door
however
must
have
possessed
greater
strength
than
we
gave
them
credit
for
at
any
rate
they
did
not
give
way
when
we
were
all
safely
on
the
wall
i
asked
the
guide
in
which
direction
we
should
now
proceed
he
pointed
to
the
adjoining
roofs
and
in
indian
file
and
with
the
stealthiness
of
cats
we
accordingly
crept
across
them
the
third
house
surmounted
we
found
ourselves
overlooking
a
narrow
alley
into
which
we
first
peered
carefully
and
having
discovered
that
no
one
was
about
eventually
dropped
now
said
the
guide
as
soon
as
we
were
down
we
must
run
along
here
and
turn
to
the
left
we
did
so
to
find
ourselves
in
a
broader
street
which
eventually
brought
us
out
into
the
thoroughfare
through
which
we
had
passed
to
reach
the
mosque
having
got
our
bearings
now
we
headed
for
the
harbour
or
at
least
for
that
part
of
the
town
with
which
i
was
best
acquainted
as
fast
as
our
legs
would
carry
us
but
startling
as
they
had
been
we
had
not
yet
done
with
adventures
for
the
night
once
in
the
security
of
the
gaslit
streets
we
said
to
the
men
who
had
got
us
into
all
the
trouble
and
having
come
to
terms
with
our
guide
packed
him
off
and
proceeded
upon
our
way
alone
five
minutes
later
the
streaming
lights
of
an
open
doorway
brought
us
to
a
standstill
and
one
glance
told
us
we
were
looking
into
the
casino
the
noise
of
the
roulette
tables
greeted
our
ears
and
as
we
had
still
plenty
of
time
and
my
companion
was
not
tired
i
thought
it
a
good
opportunity
to
show
him
another
phase
of
the
seamy
side
of
life
but
before
i
say
anything
about
that
i
must
chronicle
a
curious
circumstance
as
we
were
entering
the
building
something
made
me
look
round
to
my
intense
astonishment
i
saw
or
believed
i
saw
nikola
standing
in
the
street
regarding
me
bidding
my
companion
remain
where
he
was
for
a
moment
i
dashed
out
again
and
ran
towards
the
place
where
i
had
seen
the
figure
but
i
was
too
late
if
it
were
nikola
he
had
vanished
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
i
hunted
here
there
and
everywhere
in
doorways
under
verandahs
and
down
lanes
but
it
was
no
use
not
a
trace
of
him
could
i
discover
so
abandoning
my
search
i
returned
to
the
casino
beckenham
was
waiting
for
me
and
together
we
entered
the
building
the
room
was
packed
and
consequently
all
the
tables
were
crowded
but
as
we
did
not
intend
playing
this
was
a
matter
of
small
concern
to
us
we
were
more
interested
in
the
players
than
the
game
and
indeed
the
expressions
on
the
faces
around
us
were
extraordinary
the
effect
on
the
young
man
by
my
side
was
peculiar
he
looked
from
face
to
face
as
if
he
were
observing
the
peculiarities
of
some
strange
animals
i
watched
him
and
then
i
saw
his
expression
suddenly
change
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
i
observed
a
young
man
putting
down
his
stake
upon
the
board
his
face
was
hidden
from
me
but
by
taking
a
step
to
the
right
i
could
command
it
it
was
none
other
than
the
young
cripple
who
had
represented
his
parents
to
be
in
such
circumstances
the
same
young
man
whom
beckenham
had
assisted
so
generously
only
two
hours
before
as
we
looked
he
staked
his
last
coin
and
that
being
lost
turned
to
leave
the
building
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
pass
close
by
where
we
stood
then
his
eyes
met
those
of
his
benefactor
and
with
a
look
of
what
might
almost
have
been
shame
upon
his
face
he
slunk
down
the
steps
and
from
the
building
come
let
us
get
out
of
this
place
cried
my
companion
impatiently
i
believe
i
should
go
mad
if
i
stayed
here
long
thereupon
we
passed
out
into
the
street
and
without
further
ado
proceeded
in
the
direction
in
which
i
imagined
the
to
lie
a
youth
requested
in
broken
english
to
be
permitted
the
honour
of
piloting
us
but
feeling
confident
of
being
able
to
find
my
way
i
declined
his
services
for
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
plodded
on
until
i
began
to
wonder
why
the
harbour
did
not
heave
in
sight
it
was
a
queer
part
of
the
town
we
found
ourselves
in
the
houses
were
perceptibly
meaner
and
the
streets
narrower
at
last
i
felt
bound
to
confess
that
i
was
out
of
my
reckoning
and
did
not
know
where
we
were
what
are
we
to
do
asked
my
lord
looking
at
his
watch
it
twenty
minutes
to
eleven
and
i
promised
baxter
i
would
not
be
later
than
the
hour
what
an
idiot
i
was
not
to
take
that
guide
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
before
that
personage
appeared
round
the
corner
and
came
towards
us
i
hailed
his
coming
with
too
much
delight
to
notice
the
expression
of
malignant
satisfaction
on
his
face
and
gave
him
the
name
of
the
vessel
we
desired
to
find
he
appeared
to
understand
and
the
next
moment
we
were
marching
off
in
an
exactly
contrary
direction
we
must
have
walked
for
at
least
ten
minutes
without
speaking
a
word
from
one
small
and
dirty
street
we
turned
into
another
and
broader
one
by
this
time
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
only
a
vagrant
dog
or
two
lying
asleep
in
the
road
in
this
portion
of
the
town
gas
lamps
were
at
a
discount
consequently
more
than
half
the
streets
lay
in
deep
shadow
our
guide
walked
ahead
we
followed
paces
or
so
behind
him
i
remember
noticing
a
greek
cognomen
upon
a
sign
board
and
recalling
a
similar
name
in
thursday
island
when
something
very
much
resembling
a
thin
cord
touched
my
nose
and
fell
over
my
chin
before
i
could
put
my
hand
up
to
it
it
had
begun
to
tighten
round
my
throat
just
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
my
companion
utter
a
sharp
cry
and
after
that
i
remember
no
more
chapter
viii
our
imprisonment
and
attempt
at
escape
for
what
length
of
time
i
lay
unconscious
after
hearing
beckenham
cry
and
feeling
the
cord
tighten
round
my
throat
as
narrated
in
the
preceding
chapter
i
have
not
the
remotest
idea
i
only
know
that
when
my
senses
returned
to
me
again
i
found
myself
in
complete
darkness
the
cord
was
gone
from
my
neck
it
is
true
but
something
was
still
encircling
it
in
a
highly
unpleasant
fashion
on
putting
my
hand
up
to
it
to
my
intense
astonishment
i
discovered
it
to
be
a
collar
of
iron
padlocked
at
the
side
and
communicating
with
a
wall
at
the
back
by
means
of
a
stout
chain
fixed
in
a
ring
which
again
was
attached
to
a
swivel
this
ominous
discovery
set
me
hunting
about
to
find
out
where
i
was
and
for
a
clue
as
to
what
these
things
might
mean
that
i
was
in
a
room
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
by
putting
my
hands
behind
me
i
could
touch
two
walls
forming
a
corner
but
in
what
part
of
the
town
such
room
might
be
was
beyond
my
telling
one
thing
was
evident
however
the
walls
were
of
brick
unplastered
and
quite
innocent
of
paper
as
not
a
ray
of
light
relieved
the
darkness
i
put
my
hand
into
my
ticket
pocket
where
i
was
accustomed
to
carry
matches
and
finding
that
my
captors
had
not
deprived
me
of
them
lit
one
and
looked
about
me
it
was
a
dismal
scene
that
little
gleam
illumined
the
room
in
which
i
was
confined
was
a
small
one
being
only
about
ten
feet
long
by
eight
wide
while
if
i
had
been
able
to
stand
upright
i
might
have
raised
my
hand
to
within
two
or
three
inches
of
the
ceiling
in
the
furthest
corner
was
a
door
while
in
the
wall
on
the
right
but
hopelessly
beyond
my
reach
was
a
low
window
almost
completely
boarded
up
i
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
more
for
by
the
time
i
had
realized
these
facts
the
match
had
burnt
down
to
my
fingers
i
blew
it
out
and
hastened
to
light
another
just
as
i
did
so
a
low
moan
reached
my
ear
it
came
from
the
further
end
of
the
room
again
i
held
the
match
aloft
this
time
to
discover
a
figure
in
the
corner
opposite
the
door
one
glance
at
it
told
me
that
it
was
none
other
than
my
young
friend
the
marquis
of
beckenham
he
was
evidently
still
unconscious
for
though
i
called
him
twice
by
name
he
did
not
answer
but
continued
in
the
same
position
moaning
softly
as
before
i
had
only
time
for
a
hurried
glance
at
him
before
my
last
match
burned
down
to
my
fingers
and
had
to
be
extinguished
with
the
departure
of
the
light
a
return
of
faintness
seized
me
and
i
fell
back
into
my
corner
if
not
quite
insensible
certainly
unconscious
of
the
immediate
awkwardness
of
our
position
it
was
daylight
when
my
power
of
thinking
returned
to
me
and
long
shafts
of
sunshine
were
percolating
into
us
through
the
chinks
in
the
boards
upon
the
window
to
my
dismay
the
room
looked
even
smaller
and
dingier
than
when
i
had
examined
it
by
the
light
of
my
match
some
hours
before
the
young
marquis
lay
unconscious
in
his
corner
just
as
i
had
last
seen
him
but
with
the
widening
light
i
discovered
that
his
curious
posture
was
due
more
to
extraneous
circumstances
than
to
his
own
weakness
for
i
could
see
that
he
was
fastened
to
the
wall
by
a
similar
collar
to
my
own
i
took
out
my
watch
which
had
not
been
taken
from
me
as
i
might
have
expected
and
examined
the
dial
it
wanted
five
minutes
of
six
so
putting
it
back
into
my
pocket
i
set
myself
for
the
second
time
to
try
and
discover
where
we
were
by
reason
of
my
position
and
the
chain
that
bound
me
this
could
only
be
done
by
listening
so
i
shut
my
eyes
and
put
all
my
being
into
my
ears
for
some
moments
no
sound
rewarded
my
attention
then
a
cock
in
a
neighbouring
yard
on
my
right
crowed
lustily
a
dog
on
my
left
barked
and
a
moment
later
i
heard
the
faint
sound
of
some
one
coming
along
the
street
the
pedestrian
whoever
he
might
be
was
approaching
from
the
right
hand
and
what
was
still
more
important
my
trained
ear
informed
me
that
he
was
lame
of
one
leg
and
walked
with
crutches
closer
and
closer
he
came
but
to
my
surprise
he
did
not
pass
the
window
indeed
i
noticed
that
when
he
came
level
with
it
the
sound
was
completely
lost
to
me
this
told
me
two
things
one
that
the
window
which
was
boarded
up
did
not
look
into
the
main
thoroughfare
the
other
that
the
street
itself
ran
along
on
the
far
side
of
the
very
wall
to
which
my
chain
was
attached
as
i
arrived
at
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
beckenham
opened
his
eyes
he
sat
up
as
well
as
his
chain
would
permit
and
gazed
about
him
in
a
dazed
fashion
then
his
right
hand
went
up
to
the
iron
collar
enclosing
his
neck
and
when
he
had
realized
what
it
meant
he
appeared
even
more
mystified
than
before
he
seemed
to
doze
again
for
a
minute
or
so
then
his
eyes
opened
and
as
they
did
so
they
fell
upon
me
and
his
perplexity
found
relief
in
words
hatteras
he
said
in
a
voice
like
that
of
a
man
talking
in
his
sleep
where
are
we
and
what
on
earth
does
this
chain
mean
you
ask
me
something
that
i
want
to
know
myself
i
answered
i
can
not
tell
you
where
we
are
except
that
we
are
in
port
said
but
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
it
means
well
i
think
it
means
treachery
how
do
you
feel
now
very
sick
indeed
and
my
head
aches
horribly
but
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
it
is
treachery
this
was
the
one
question
of
all
others
i
had
been
dreading
for
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
when
all
was
said
and
done
i
was
bitterly
to
blame
however
unpleasant
or
not
the
explanation
had
to
be
got
through
and
without
delay
lord
beckenham
i
began
sitting
upright
and
clasping
my
hands
round
my
knees
this
is
a
pretty
bad
business
for
me
i
have
the
reputation
of
being
a
coward
but
i
own
i
feel
pretty
rocky
and
mean
when
i
see
you
sitting
there
on
the
floor
with
that
iron
collar
round
your
neck
and
that
chain
holding
you
to
the
wall
and
know
that
it
in
a
measure
all
my
stupid
blundering
folly
that
has
brought
it
about
oh
do
say
that
mr
hatteras
was
the
young
man
generous
reply
for
whatever
or
whoever
may
be
to
blame
for
it
i
sure
you
not
that
because
you
do
know
everything
my
lord
wait
till
you
have
heard
what
i
have
to
tell
you
before
you
give
me
such
complete
absolution
i
not
going
to
blame
you
whatever
you
may
tell
me
but
please
go
on
there
and
then
i
set
to
work
and
told
him
all
that
had
happened
to
me
since
my
arrival
in
london
informed
him
of
my
meeting
with
nikola
of
wetherell
hasty
departure
for
australia
of
my
distrust
for
baxter
described
the
telegram
incident
and
baxter
curious
behaviour
afterwards
narrated
my
subsequent
meeting
with
the
two
men
in
the
sailor
described
my
journey
to
plymouth
and
finished
with
the
catastrophe
that
had
happened
to
me
there
now
you
see
i
said
in
conclusion
why
i
regard
myself
as
being
so
much
to
blame
excuse
me
he
answered
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
see
it
in
the
same
light
at
all
i
afraid
i
must
be
more
explicit
then
in
the
first
place
you
must
understand
that
without
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
baxter
was
chosen
for
your
tutor
by
nikola
whose
agent
he
undoubtedly
is
for
a
specific
purpose
now
what
do
you
think
that
purpose
was
you
do
know
to
induce
your
father
to
let
you
travel
to
be
sure
you
ask
why
they
should
want
you
to
travel
we
come
to
that
directly
their
plan
is
succeeding
admirably
when
i
come
upon
the
scene
and
like
the
great
blundering
idiot
i
am
must
needs
set
to
work
unconsciously
to
assist
them
in
their
nefarious
designs
your
father
eventually
consents
and
it
is
arranged
that
you
shall
set
off
for
australia
at
once
then
it
is
discovered
that
i
am
going
to
leave
in
the
same
boat
this
does
not
suit
nikola
plans
at
all
so
he
determines
to
prevent
my
sailing
with
you
by
a
happy
chance
he
is
unsuccessful
and
i
follow
and
join
the
boat
in
naples
good
gracious
i
see
something
else
now
what
is
that
simply
this
i
could
not
help
thinking
at
the
time
that
your
bout
of
between
naples
and
this
infernal
place
was
extraordinary
well
if
i
not
very
much
mistaken
were
physicked
and
it
was
baxter
but
why
ah
that
yet
to
be
discovered
but
you
may
bet
your
bottom
dollar
it
was
some
part
of
their
devilish
conspiracy
i
as
certain
of
that
as
that
we
are
here
now
now
here
another
point
do
you
remember
my
running
out
of
the
casino
last
night
well
that
was
because
i
saw
nikola
standing
in
the
roadway
are
you
certain
how
could
he
have
got
here
and
what
could
his
reasons
be
for
watching
us
why
ca
you
see
to
find
out
how
his
plot
is
succeeding
to
be
sure
and
that
brings
us
back
to
our
original
question
what
is
that
plot
that
rather
more
difficult
to
answer
but
if
you
ask
my
candid
opinion
i
should
say
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
make
you
prisoner
and
blackmail
your
father
for
a
ransom
for
some
few
minutes
neither
of
us
spoke
the
outlook
seemed
too
hopeless
for
words
and
the
marquis
was
still
too
weak
to
keep
up
an
animated
conversation
for
any
length
of
time
he
sat
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
but
presently
he
looked
up
again
my
poor
father
he
said
what
a
state
he
will
be
in
and
what
worries
me
more
i
answered
is
how
he
will
regret
ever
having
listened
to
my
advice
what
a
dolt
i
was
not
to
have
told
him
of
my
suspicions
you
must
not
blame
yourself
for
that
i
am
sure
my
father
would
hold
you
as
innocent
as
i
do
now
let
us
consider
our
position
in
the
first
place
where
are
we
do
you
think
in
the
second
is
there
any
possible
chance
of
escape
to
the
first
my
answer
is
know
to
the
second
say
i
have
discovered
one
thing
however
and
that
is
that
the
street
does
not
lie
outside
that
window
but
runs
along
on
the
other
side
of
this
wall
behind
me
the
window
i
suspect
looks
out
on
to
some
sort
of
a
courtyard
but
unfortunately
that
information
is
not
much
use
to
us
as
we
can
neither
of
us
move
away
from
where
we
are
placed
is
there
no
other
way
not
one
as
far
as
i
can
tell
can
you
see
anything
on
your
side
nothing
at
all
unless
we
could
get
at
the
door
but
what
that
sticking
out
of
the
wall
near
your
feet
to
get
a
better
view
of
it
i
stooped
as
much
as
i
was
able
it
looks
like
a
pipe
the
end
of
a
pipe
it
certainly
was
and
sticking
out
into
the
room
but
where
it
led
to
and
why
it
had
been
cut
off
in
this
peculiar
fashion
were
two
questions
i
could
no
more
answer
than
i
could
fly
does
it
run
out
into
the
street
do
you
think
was
immediate
query
if
so
you
might
manage
to
call
through
it
to
some
and
ask
him
to
obtain
assistance
for
us
a
splendid
notion
if
i
could
get
my
mouth
anywhere
within
a
foot
of
it
but
as
this
chain
will
not
permit
me
to
do
that
it
might
as
well
be
a
hundred
miles
off
it
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
touch
it
with
my
fingers
do
you
think
if
you
had
a
stick
you
could
push
a
piece
of
paper
through
we
might
write
a
message
possibly
but
there
another
drawback
to
that
i
have
the
necessary
piece
of
stick
here
is
a
stiff
piece
of
straw
try
that
he
harpooned
a
piece
of
straw
about
eight
inches
long
across
the
room
towards
me
and
when
i
had
received
it
i
thrust
it
carefully
into
the
pipe
a
disappointment
however
was
in
store
for
us
it
no
use
i
reported
sorrowfully
as
i
threw
the
straw
away
it
has
an
elbow
down
and
that
would
prevent
any
message
from
being
pushed
through
then
we
must
try
to
discover
some
other
plan
do
lose
heart
hush
i
hear
somebody
coming
true
enough
a
heavy
footfall
was
approaching
down
the
passage
it
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
we
were
confined
and
a
key
was
inserted
in
the
lock
next
moment
the
door
swung
open
and
a
tall
man
entered
the
room
a
ray
of
sunlight
penetrating
between
the
boards
that
covered
the
window
fell
upon
him
and
showed
us
that
his
hair
was
white
and
that
his
face
was
deeply
pitted
with
smallpox
marks
now
where
had
i
met
or
heard
of
a
man
with
those
two
peculiarities
before
ah
i
remembered
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
doorway
looking
about
him
and
then
strolled
into
the
centre
of
the
room
gentlemen
he
said
with
an
airy
condescension
that
stung
like
an
insult
i
trust
you
have
no
fault
to
find
with
the
lodging
our
poor
hospitality
is
able
to
afford
you
prendergast
i
answered
determined
to
try
him
with
the
name
of
the
man
mentioned
by
my
sweetheart
in
her
letter
what
does
this
mean
why
have
we
been
made
prisoners
like
this
i
demand
to
be
released
at
once
you
will
have
to
answer
to
our
consul
for
this
detention
for
a
brief
space
he
appeared
to
be
dumbfounded
by
my
knowledge
of
his
name
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
and
leaned
his
back
against
the
wall
looking
us
both
carefully
over
before
he
answered
i
shall
be
only
too
pleased
he
said
sneeringly
but
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
i
do
think
we
need
trouble
about
explanations
yet
awhile
pray
what
do
you
mean
by
that
exactly
what
i
say
as
you
are
likely
to
be
our
guests
for
some
considerable
time
to
come
there
will
be
no
need
for
explanation
you
mean
to
keep
us
prisoners
then
do
you
very
well
prendergast
be
assured
of
this
when
i
get
loose
i
make
you
feel
the
weight
of
my
arm
i
think
it
very
probable
there
will
be
a
fight
if
ever
we
do
meet
he
answered
coolly
taking
a
cigarette
from
his
pocket
and
lighting
it
and
it
my
impression
you
be
a
man
worth
fighting
mr
hatteras
if
you
think
my
father
will
let
me
remain
here
very
long
you
much
mistaken
said
beckenham
and
as
for
the
ransom
you
expect
him
to
pay
i
do
somehow
fancy
you
get
a
halfpenny
at
the
mention
of
the
word
ransom
i
noticed
that
a
new
and
queer
expression
came
into
our
captor
face
he
did
not
reply
however
except
to
utter
his
usual
irritating
laugh
having
done
so
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
something
in
arabic
in
answer
a
gigantic
negro
made
his
appearance
bearing
in
his
hands
a
tray
on
which
were
set
two
basins
of
food
and
two
large
mugs
of
water
these
were
placed
before
us
and
prendergast
bade
us
if
we
were
hungry
fall
to
you
must
not
imagine
that
we
wish
to
starve
you
he
said
food
will
be
served
to
you
twice
a
day
and
if
you
want
it
you
can
even
be
supplied
with
spirits
and
tobacco
now
before
i
go
one
word
of
advice
do
indulge
in
any
idea
of
escape
communication
with
the
outside
world
is
absolutely
impossible
and
you
will
find
that
those
collars
and
chains
will
stand
a
good
strain
before
they
will
give
way
if
you
behave
yourselves
you
will
be
well
looked
after
but
if
you
attempt
any
larks
you
will
be
confined
in
different
rooms
and
there
will
be
a
radical
change
in
our
behaviour
so
saying
he
left
the
room
taking
the
precaution
to
lock
the
door
carefully
behind
him
when
we
were
once
more
alone
a
long
silence
fell
upon
us
it
would
be
idle
for
me
to
say
that
the
generous
behaviour
of
the
young
marquis
with
regard
to
my
share
in
this
wretched
business
had
set
my
mind
at
rest
but
if
it
had
not
done
that
it
had
at
least
served
to
intensify
another
resolution
come
what
might
i
told
myself
i
would
find
a
way
of
escape
and
he
should
be
returned
to
his
father
safe
and
sound
if
it
cost
me
my
life
to
do
it
but
how
we
to
escape
we
could
not
move
from
our
places
on
account
of
the
chains
that
secured
us
to
the
walls
and
though
i
put
all
my
whole
strength
into
it
i
found
i
could
not
dislodge
the
staple
a
hundredth
part
of
an
inch
from
its
the
morning
wore
slowly
on
came
and
went
the
afternoon
dragged
its
dismal
length
and
still
there
was
no
change
in
our
position
towards
sundown
the
same
gigantic
negro
entered
the
room
again
bringing
us
our
evening
meal
when
he
left
we
were
locked
up
for
the
night
with
only
the
contemplation
of
our
woes
and
the
companionship
of
the
multitudes
of
mice
that
scampered
about
the
floor
to
enliven
us
the
events
of
the
next
seven
days
are
hardly
worth
chronicling
unless
it
is
to
state
that
every
morning
at
daylight
the
same
cock
crew
and
the
same
dog
barked
while
at
six
the
same
cripple
invariably
made
his
way
down
the
street
behind
me
at
eight
almost
to
the
minute
breakfast
was
served
to
us
and
just
as
punctually
the
evening
meal
made
its
appearance
as
the
sun
was
declining
behind
the
opposite
not
again
did
we
see
any
sign
of
prendergast
and
though
times
out
of
number
i
tugged
at
my
chain
i
was
never
a
whit
nearer
loosening
it
than
i
had
been
on
the
first
occasion
one
after
another
plans
of
escape
were
proposed
discussed
and
invariably
rejected
as
impracticable
so
another
week
passed
and
another
until
we
had
been
imprisoned
in
that
loathsome
place
not
less
than
twenty
days
by
the
end
of
that
time
as
may
be
supposed
we
were
as
desperate
as
men
could
well
be
i
must
however
admit
that
anything
like
the
patience
and
pluck
of
my
companion
under
such
circumstances
i
had
never
in
my
life
met
with
before
one
fact
had
repeatedly
struck
me
as
significant
and
that
was
the
circumstance
that
every
morning
between
six
and
as
already
narrated
the
same
cripple
went
down
the
street
and
in
connexion
with
this
within
the
last
few
days
of
the
time
a
curious
coincidence
had
revealed
itself
to
me
from
the
tapping
of
his
crutches
on
the
stones
i
discovered
that
while
one
was
shod
with
iron
the
other
was
not
now
where
and
when
had
i
noticed
that
peculiarity
in
a
cripple
before
that
i
had
observed
it
somewhere
i
felt
certain
for
nearly
half
the
day
i
turned
this
over
and
over
in
my
mind
and
then
in
the
middle
of
our
evening
meal
enlightenment
came
to
me
i
remembered
the
man
whose
piteous
tale
had
so
much
affected
beckenham
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
and
the
sound
his
crutches
made
upon
the
pavement
as
he
left
us
if
my
surmise
proved
correct
and
we
could
only
manage
to
communicate
with
him
here
was
a
golden
opportunity
but
how
were
we
to
do
this
we
discussed
it
and
discussed
it
times
out
of
number
but
in
vain
that
he
must
be
stopped
on
his
way
down
the
street
need
not
to
be
argued
at
all
in
what
way
however
could
this
be
done
the
window
was
out
of
the
question
the
door
was
not
to
be
thought
of
in
that
case
the
only
communicating
place
would
be
the
small
pipe
by
my
side
but
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
by
reason
of
the
elbow
it
would
be
clearly
impossible
to
force
a
message
through
it
all
day
we
devoted
ourselves
to
attempts
to
solve
what
seemed
a
hopeless
difficulty
then
like
a
flash
a
brilliant
inspiration
burst
upon
me
by
jove
i
have
it
i
said
taking
care
to
whisper
lest
any
one
might
be
listening
at
the
door
we
must
manage
by
hook
or
crook
to
catch
a
mouse
let
him
carry
our
appeal
for
help
to
the
outside
a
magnificent
idea
if
we
can
catch
one
i
do
believe
you
saved
us
but
to
catch
a
mouse
was
easier
said
than
done
though
the
room
was
alive
with
them
they
were
so
nimble
and
so
cunning
that
try
how
we
would
we
could
not
lay
hold
of
one
but
at
length
my
efforts
were
rewarded
and
after
a
little
struggle
i
held
my
precious
captive
in
my
hand
by
this
time
another
idea
had
come
to
me
if
we
wanted
to
bring
nikola
and
his
gang
to
justice
and
to
discover
their
reason
for
hatching
this
plot
against
us
it
would
not
do
to
ask
the
public
at
large
for
help
and
i
must
own
in
spite
of
our
long
imprisonment
i
was
weak
enough
to
feel
a
curiosity
as
to
their
motive
no
it
must
be
to
the
beggar
who
passed
the
house
every
morning
that
we
must
appeal
this
letter
concerns
you
more
than
me
i
said
to
my
have
you
a
lead
pencil
in
your
pocket
he
had
and
immediately
threw
it
across
to
me
then
taking
a
small
piece
of
paper
from
my
pocket
i
set
myself
to
compose
the
following
in
french
and
english
assisted
by
my
companion
if
this
should
meet
the
eye
of
the
individual
to
whom
a
young
englishman
gave
half
a
sovereign
in
charity
three
weeks
ago
he
is
implored
to
assist
one
who
assisted
him
and
who
has
been
imprisoned
ever
since
that
day
in
the
room
with
the
blank
wall
facing
the
street
and
the
window
on
the
side
to
do
this
he
must
obtain
a
small
file
and
discover
a
way
to
convey
it
into
the
room
by
means
of
the
small
pipe
leading
through
the
blank
wall
into
the
street
perhaps
if
this
could
be
dislodged
it
might
be
pushed
in
through
the
aperture
thus
made
on
receipt
of
the
file
an
english
note
will
be
conveyed
to
him
in
the
same
way
as
this
letter
and
another
if
secrecy
is
observed
and
those
in
the
house
escape
this
important
epistle
had
hardly
been
concocted
before
the
door
was
unlocked
and
our
dusky
servitor
entered
with
the
evening
meal
he
had
long
since
abandoned
his
first
habit
of
bringing
us
our
food
in
separate
receptacles
but
conveyed
it
to
us
now
in
the
saucepan
in
which
it
was
cooked
dividing
it
thence
into
our
basins
these
latter
it
may
be
interesting
to
state
had
not
been
washed
since
our
arrival
all
the
time
that
our
jailer
was
in
the
room
i
held
my
trembling
prisoner
in
my
hand
clinging
to
him
as
to
the
one
thing
which
connected
us
with
liberty
but
the
door
had
no
sooner
closed
upon
him
than
i
had
tilted
out
my
food
upon
the
floor
and
converted
my
basin
into
a
trap
it
may
be
guessed
how
long
that
night
seemed
to
us
and
with
what
trembling
eagerness
we
awaited
the
first
signs
of
breaking
day
directly
it
was
light
i
took
off
and
unravelled
one
of
my
socks
the
thread
thus
obtained
i
doubled
and
having
done
this
secured
one
end
of
it
to
the
note
which
i
had
rolled
into
a
small
compass
attaching
the
other
to
my
captive
mouse
hind
leg
then
we
set
ourselves
to
wait
for
six
the
hour
came
and
minute
after
minute
went
by
before
we
heard
in
the
distance
the
tapping
of
the
crutches
on
the
stones
little
by
little
the
sound
grew
louder
and
then
fainter
and
when
i
judged
he
was
nearly
at
my
back
i
stooped
and
thrust
our
curious
messenger
into
the
pipe
then
we
sat
down
to
await
the
result
as
the
mouse
only
too
glad
to
escape
ran
into
the
aperture
the
thread
on
which
our
very
lives
depended
swiftly
followed
dragging
its
message
after
it
minutes
went
by
half
an
hour
an
hour
and
then
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
still
nothing
came
to
tell
us
that
our
appeal
had
been
successful
that
night
i
caught
another
mouse
wrote
the
letter
again
and
at
six
next
morning
once
more
despatched
it
on
its
journey
another
day
went
by
without
reply
that
night
we
caught
another
and
at
next
morning
sent
it
off
a
third
and
even
a
fourth
followed
but
still
without
success
by
this
time
the
mice
were
almost
impossible
to
catch
but
our
wits
were
sharpened
by
despair
and
we
managed
to
hit
upon
a
method
that
eventually
secured
for
us
a
plentiful
supply
for
the
sixth
time
the
letter
was
written
and
despatched
at
the
moment
the
footsteps
were
coming
down
the
street
once
more
the
tiny
animal
crawled
into
the
pipe
and
once
more
the
message
disappeared
upon
its
journey
another
day
was
spent
in
anxious
waiting
but
this
time
we
were
not
destined
to
be
disappointed
about
eight
that
night
just
as
we
were
giving
up
hope
i
detected
a
faint
noise
near
my
feet
it
was
for
all
the
world
as
if
some
one
were
forcing
a
stick
through
a
hole
in
a
brick
wall
i
informed
beckenham
of
the
fact
in
a
whisper
and
then
put
my
head
down
to
listen
yes
there
was
the
sound
again
oh
if
only
i
had
a
match
but
it
was
no
use
wishing
for
what
was
impossible
so
i
put
my
hand
down
to
the
pipe
was
moving
it
turned
in
my
hand
moved
to
and
fro
for
a
brief
space
and
then
disappeared
from
my
grasp
entirely
next
moment
it
had
left
the
room
a
few
seconds
later
something
cold
was
thrust
into
my
hand
from
its
rough
edge
i
knew
it
to
be
a
i
drew
it
out
as
if
it
were
made
of
gold
and
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
a
piece
of
string
was
attached
to
it
and
the
reason
of
this
i
was
at
first
at
some
loss
to
account
for
but
a
reflection
told
me
that
it
was
to
assist
in
the
fulfilment
of
our
share
of
the
bargain
so
taking
a
note
from
the
secret
pocket
in
which
i
carried
my
paper
money
i
tied
the
string
to
it
and
it
was
instantly
withdrawn
a
minute
could
not
have
elapsed
before
i
was
at
work
upon
the
staple
of
my
collar
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
it
was
filed
through
and
the
iron
was
off
my
neck
if
i
tried
for
a
year
i
could
not
make
you
understand
what
a
relief
it
was
to
me
to
stand
upright
i
stretched
myself
again
and
again
and
then
crossed
the
room
on
in
the
dark
to
where
the
marquis
lay
you
are
free
he
whispered
clutching
and
shaking
my
hand
oh
thank
god
hush
put
down
your
head
and
let
me
get
to
work
upon
your
collar
before
you
say
anything
more
as
i
was
able
this
time
to
get
at
my
work
standing
up
it
was
not
very
long
before
beckenham
was
as
free
as
i
was
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
we
shook
hands
warmly
in
the
dark
now
i
said
leading
him
towards
the
door
we
will
make
our
escape
and
i
pity
the
man
who
attempts
to
stop
us
chapter
ix
nikola
permits
us
a
free
passage
the
old
saying
do
count
your
chickens
before
they
hatched
is
as
good
a
warning
as
any
i
know
for
if
we
had
not
been
so
completely
occupied
filing
through
the
staples
of
our
collars
we
should
not
have
omitted
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
even
when
we
should
have
removed
the
chains
that
bound
us
we
would
still
be
prisoners
in
the
room
i
very
much
afraid
however
even
had
we
remembered
this
point
we
should
only
have
considered
it
of
minor
importance
and
one
to
be
easily
overcome
as
it
was
the
unwelcome
fact
remained
that
the
door
locked
and
what
was
worse
that
the
lock
itself
had
for
security
sake
been
placed
on
the
outside
so
that
there
was
no
chance
of
our
being
able
to
pick
it
even
had
our
accomplishments
lain
in
that
direction
try
the
window
whispered
beckenham
in
answer
to
the
heavy
sigh
which
followed
my
last
discovery
accordingly
we
crossed
the
room
and
i
put
my
hands
upon
one
of
the
boards
and
pulled
but
i
might
as
well
have
tried
to
tow
a
troopship
with
a
piece
of
cotton
for
all
the
satisfactory
result
i
got
the
planks
were
trebly
screwed
to
the
window
frame
and
each
in
turn
defied
me
when
i
was
tired
beckenham
put
his
strength
to
it
but
even
our
united
efforts
were
of
no
avail
and
panting
and
exhausted
we
were
at
length
obliged
to
give
it
up
as
hopeless
this
is
a
pretty
fix
we
got
ourselves
into
i
said
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
sufficient
breath
to
speak
how
on
earth
are
we
to
escape
i
ca
say
unless
we
manage
to
burst
that
door
and
fight
our
way
out
i
wonder
if
that
could
be
done
first
let
look
at
the
door
we
crossed
the
room
again
and
i
examined
the
door
carefully
it
was
not
a
very
strong
one
but
i
was
sufficient
of
a
carpenter
to
know
that
it
would
withstand
a
good
deal
of
pressure
before
it
would
give
way
i
a
good
mind
to
try
it
i
said
but
in
that
case
remember
it
will
probably
mean
a
fight
on
the
other
side
and
unarmed
and
weak
as
we
are
we
shall
be
pretty
sure
to
get
the
worst
of
it
never
mind
that
my
intrepid
companion
replied
with
a
confidence
in
his
voice
that
i
was
very
far
from
feeling
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
even
if
we
killed
it
could
be
worse
than
being
buried
alive
that
so
and
if
fighting
your
idea
i
your
man
i
answered
let
me
first
take
my
bearings
and
then
i
see
what
i
can
do
against
it
you
get
out
of
the
way
but
be
sure
to
stand
by
to
rush
the
passage
directly
the
door
goes
again
i
felt
the
door
and
wall
in
order
that
i
might
be
sure
where
it
lay
and
having
done
so
crossed
the
room
my
heart
was
beating
like
a
nasmyth
hammer
and
it
was
nearly
a
minute
before
i
could
pull
myself
together
sufficiently
for
my
rush
then
summoning
every
muscle
in
my
body
to
my
assistance
i
dashed
across
and
at
it
with
all
the
strength
my
frame
was
capable
of
considering
the
darkness
of
the
room
my
steering
was
not
so
bad
for
my
shoulder
caught
the
door
just
above
its
centre
there
was
a
great
crash
a
noise
of
breaking
timbers
and
amid
a
shower
of
splinters
and
general
i
fell
headlong
through
into
the
passage
by
the
time
it
would
have
taken
me
to
count
five
beckenham
was
beside
me
helping
me
to
rise
now
stand
by
for
big
trouble
i
said
rubbing
my
shoulder
and
every
moment
expecting
to
see
a
door
open
and
a
crowd
of
ruffians
come
rushing
out
we
shall
have
them
on
us
in
a
minute
but
to
our
intense
astonishment
it
was
all
dead
silence
not
a
sound
of
any
single
kind
save
our
excited
breathing
greeted
our
ears
we
might
have
broken
into
an
empty
house
for
all
we
knew
the
difference
for
nearly
five
minutes
we
stood
side
by
side
waiting
for
the
battle
which
did
not
come
what
on
earth
does
it
mean
i
asked
my
companion
that
crash
of
mine
was
loud
enough
to
wake
the
dead
can
they
have
deserted
the
place
think
you
and
left
us
to
starve
i
ca
make
it
out
any
more
than
you
can
he
answered
but
do
you
think
we
better
take
advantage
of
their
not
coming
to
find
a
way
out
of
course
one
of
us
had
better
creep
down
the
passage
and
discover
how
the
land
lies
as
i
the
stronger
i
go
you
wait
here
i
crept
along
the
passage
treading
cautiously
as
a
cat
for
i
knew
that
both
our
lives
depended
on
it
though
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
sixty
feet
it
seemed
of
interminable
length
and
was
as
black
as
night
not
a
glimmer
of
light
however
faint
met
my
eyes
on
and
on
i
stole
expecting
every
moment
to
be
pounced
upon
and
seized
but
no
such
fate
awaited
me
if
however
our
jailers
did
not
appear
another
danger
was
in
store
for
me
in
the
middle
of
my
walk
my
feet
suddenly
went
from
under
me
and
i
found
myself
falling
i
knew
not
where
in
reality
it
was
only
a
drop
of
about
three
feet
down
a
short
flight
of
steps
such
a
noise
as
my
fall
made
however
was
surely
never
heard
but
still
no
sound
came
then
beckenham
fumbled
his
way
cautiously
down
the
steps
to
my
side
and
whispered
an
inquiry
as
to
what
had
happened
i
told
him
in
as
few
words
as
possible
and
then
struggled
to
my
feet
again
just
as
i
did
so
my
eyes
detected
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
low
down
on
the
floor
ahead
of
us
from
its
position
it
evidently
emanated
from
the
doorway
of
a
room
oh
if
we
only
had
a
match
i
whispered
it
no
good
wishing
said
beckenham
what
do
you
advise
it
difficult
to
say
i
answered
but
i
should
think
we
better
listen
at
that
door
and
try
to
discover
if
there
is
any
one
inside
if
there
is
and
he
is
alone
we
must
steal
in
upon
him
let
him
see
that
we
are
desperate
and
force
him
to
show
us
a
way
out
ten
chances
to
one
if
we
go
on
prowling
about
here
we
shall
stumble
upon
the
whole
nest
of
them
then
we
be
caught
like
rats
in
a
trap
what
do
you
think
i
agree
with
you
go
on
without
further
ado
we
crept
towards
the
light
which
as
i
expected
came
from
under
a
door
and
listened
some
one
was
plainly
moving
about
inside
but
though
we
waited
for
what
seemed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
must
in
reality
have
been
less
than
a
minute
and
a
half
we
could
hear
no
voices
whoever
he
is
he
alone
that
certain
whispered
my
companion
open
the
door
softly
and
we
creep
in
upon
him
in
answer
and
little
by
little
a
cold
shiver
running
down
my
back
lest
it
should
creak
and
so
give
warning
to
the
person
within
i
turned
the
handle
pushed
open
the
door
and
we
looked
inside
then
but
my
gracious
if
i
live
to
be
a
thousand
i
shall
never
forget
the
sight
that
met
my
eyes
the
room
itself
was
a
long
and
low
one
its
measurements
possibly
sixty
feet
by
fifteen
the
roof
for
there
was
no
ceiling
was
of
wood
crossed
by
heavy
rafters
and
much
begrimed
with
dirt
and
smoke
the
floor
was
of
some
highly
polished
wood
closely
resembling
oak
and
was
completely
bare
but
the
shape
and
construction
of
the
room
itself
were
as
nothing
compared
with
the
strangeness
of
its
furniture
and
occupants
words
would
fail
me
if
i
tried
to
give
you
a
true
and
accurate
description
of
it
i
only
know
that
strong
man
as
i
was
and
used
to
the
horrors
of
life
and
death
what
i
saw
before
me
then
made
my
blood
run
cold
and
my
flesh
creep
as
it
had
never
done
before
to
begin
with
round
the
walls
were
arranged
at
regular
intervals
more
than
a
dozen
enormous
bottles
each
of
which
contained
what
looked
to
me
only
too
much
like
human
specimens
pickled
in
some
fluid
resembling
spirits
of
wine
between
these
gigantic
but
more
than
horrible
receptacles
were
numberless
smaller
ones
holding
other
and
even
more
dreadful
remains
while
on
pedestals
and
stands
bolt
upright
and
reclining
were
skeletons
of
men
monkeys
and
quite
a
hundred
sorts
of
animals
the
intervening
spaces
were
filled
with
skulls
bones
and
the
apparatus
for
every
kind
of
murder
known
to
the
fertile
brain
of
man
there
were
european
rifles
revolvers
bayonets
and
swords
italian
stilettos
turkish
scimitars
greek
knives
central
african
spears
and
poisoned
arrows
zulu
knobkerries
afghan
yataghans
malay
krises
sumatra
chinese
dirks
new
guinea
implements
australian
spears
and
boomerangs
polynesian
stone
hatchets
and
numerous
other
weapons
the
names
of
which
i
can
not
now
remember
mixed
up
with
them
were
implements
for
every
sort
of
wizardry
known
to
the
superstitious
from
english
love
charms
to
african
obi
sticks
from
spiritualistic
planchettes
to
the
most
horrible
of
fijian
death
potions
in
the
centre
of
the
wall
opposite
to
where
we
stood
was
a
large
fireplace
of
the
fashion
usually
met
with
in
old
english
and
on
either
side
of
it
a
figure
that
nearly
turned
me
sick
with
horror
that
on
the
right
hand
was
apparently
a
native
of
northern
india
if
one
might
judge
by
his
dress
and
complexion
he
sat
on
the
floor
in
a
constrained
attitude
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
his
head
which
was
at
least
three
times
too
big
for
his
body
was
so
heavy
as
to
require
an
iron
tripod
with
a
ring
or
collar
in
the
top
of
it
to
keep
it
from
overbalancing
him
and
bringing
him
to
the
floor
to
add
to
the
horror
of
this
awful
head
it
was
quite
bald
the
skin
was
drawn
tensely
over
the
bones
and
upon
this
veins
stood
out
as
large
as
macaroni
stems
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
was
a
creature
and
the
like
of
which
i
remember
once
to
have
seen
in
a
museum
of
monstrosities
in
sydney
where
if
my
memory
serves
me
he
was
described
upon
the
catalogue
as
a
burmese
he
was
chained
to
the
wall
in
somewhat
the
same
fashion
as
we
had
been
and
was
chattering
and
scratching
for
all
the
world
like
a
monkey
in
a
zoo
but
horrible
as
these
things
were
the
greatest
surprise
of
all
was
yet
to
come
for
standing
at
the
heavy
oaken
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
a
man
i
should
have
known
anywhere
if
i
had
been
permitted
half
a
glance
at
him
was
when
we
entered
he
was
busily
occupied
with
a
scalpel
dissecting
an
animal
strangely
resembling
a
monkey
on
the
table
and
watching
the
work
upon
which
his
master
was
engaged
sat
his
constant
companion
the
same
fiendish
black
cat
i
have
mentioned
elsewhere
while
at
the
end
nearest
us
standing
on
the
better
to
see
what
was
going
on
was
an
albino
dwarf
scarcely
more
than
two
feet
eight
inches
high
so
stealthily
however
had
our
approach
been
made
and
so
carefully
had
i
opened
the
door
that
we
were
well
into
the
room
before
our
appearance
was
discovered
and
also
before
i
had
realized
into
whose
presence
we
had
stumbled
then
my
foot
touched
a
board
that
creaked
and
nikola
looked
up
from
the
work
upon
which
he
was
engaged
his
pale
thin
face
did
not
show
the
slightest
sign
of
surprise
as
he
said
in
his
usual
placid
tone
so
you
have
managed
to
escape
from
your
room
gentlemen
well
and
pray
what
do
you
want
for
a
moment
i
was
so
much
overcome
with
surprise
that
my
tongue
refused
to
perform
its
office
then
i
said
advancing
towards
him
as
i
spoke
closely
followed
by
the
marquis
so
nikola
we
have
met
at
last
at
last
hatteras
as
you
say
this
singular
being
replied
still
without
showing
a
sign
of
either
interest
or
embarrassment
all
things
considered
i
suppose
you
would
deem
me
ironical
if
i
ventured
to
say
that
i
am
pleased
to
see
you
about
again
however
do
let
me
keep
you
standing
wo
you
sit
down
my
lord
let
me
offer
you
a
chair
all
this
time
we
were
edging
up
alongside
the
table
and
i
was
making
ready
for
a
rush
at
him
but
he
was
not
to
be
taken
off
his
guard
his
extraordinary
eyes
had
been
watching
me
intently
taking
in
my
every
movement
and
a
curious
effect
they
had
upon
me
nikola
i
said
the
game
is
up
you
beat
me
last
time
but
now
you
must
own
i
come
out
on
top
do
utter
a
word
or
call
for
assistance
if
you
do
you
a
dead
man
now
drop
that
knife
you
hold
in
your
hand
and
show
us
the
way
out
the
marquis
was
on
his
right
i
was
on
his
left
and
we
were
close
upon
him
as
i
spoke
still
he
showed
no
sign
of
fear
though
he
must
have
known
the
danger
of
his
position
but
his
eyes
glowed
in
his
head
like
living
coals
you
will
ask
why
we
did
not
rush
at
him
well
if
i
am
obliged
to
own
it
i
must
the
truth
was
such
was
the
power
that
emanated
from
this
extraordinary
man
that
though
we
both
knew
the
crucial
moment
of
our
enterprise
had
arrived
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
us
neither
of
us
could
stir
an
inch
when
he
spoke
his
voice
seemed
to
cut
like
a
knife
so
you
think
my
game
is
up
hatteras
do
you
i
afraid
once
more
i
must
differ
from
you
look
behind
you
i
did
so
and
that
glance
showed
me
how
cleverly
we
been
trapped
leaning
against
the
door
watching
us
with
cruel
yet
smiling
eyes
was
our
old
enemy
prendergast
revolver
in
hand
just
behind
me
were
two
powerful
soudanese
while
near
the
marquis
was
a
man
looking
like
a
greek
and
a
very
stalwart
greek
at
that
observing
our
discomfiture
nikola
seated
himself
in
a
big
chair
near
the
fireplace
and
folded
his
hands
in
the
curious
fashion
i
have
before
described
as
he
did
so
his
black
cat
sprang
to
his
shoulder
and
sat
there
watching
us
all
nikola
was
the
first
to
speak
hatteras
he
said
with
devilish
clearness
and
deliberation
you
should
really
know
me
better
by
this
time
than
to
think
you
could
outwit
me
so
easily
is
my
reputation
after
all
so
small
and
while
i
think
of
it
pray
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
returning
to
you
your
five
pound
note
and
your
letters
your
mice
were
perfect
messengers
were
they
not
as
he
spoke
he
handed
me
the
selfsame
bank
of
england
note
i
had
despatched
through
the
pipe
that
very
evening
in
payment
for
the
file
then
he
shook
from
a
box
he
had
taken
from
the
all
the
communications
i
had
written
imploring
assistance
from
the
outside
world
to
properly
estimate
my
chagrin
and
astonishment
would
be
very
difficult
i
could
only
sit
and
stare
first
at
the
money
and
then
at
the
letters
in
blankest
amazement
so
we
had
not
been
rescued
by
the
cripple
after
all
was
it
possible
that
while
we
had
been
so
busy
arranging
our
escape
we
had
in
reality
been
all
the
time
under
the
closest
surveillance
if
that
were
so
then
this
knowledge
of
our
doings
would
account
for
the
silence
with
which
my
attack
upon
the
door
had
been
received
now
we
were
in
an
even
worse
position
than
before
i
looked
at
beckenham
but
his
head
was
down
and
his
right
hand
was
picking
idly
at
the
table
edge
he
was
evidently
waiting
for
what
was
coming
next
in
sheer
despair
i
turned
to
nikola
since
you
have
outwitted
us
again
nikola
do
not
play
with
us
tell
us
straight
out
what
our
fate
is
to
be
if
it
means
going
back
to
that
room
again
said
beckenham
in
a
voice
i
hardly
recognized
i
would
far
rather
die
and
be
done
with
it
do
not
fear
my
lord
you
shall
not
die
nikola
said
turning
to
him
with
a
bow
believe
me
you
will
live
to
enjoy
many
happier
hours
than
those
you
have
been
compelled
to
spend
under
my
roof
what
do
you
mean
the
doctor
did
not
answer
for
nearly
a
moment
then
he
took
what
looked
to
me
suspiciously
like
a
cablegram
form
from
his
pocket
and
carefully
examined
it
having
done
so
he
said
quietly
gentlemen
you
ask
what
i
mean
well
i
mean
this
if
you
wish
to
leave
this
house
this
very
minute
you
are
free
to
do
so
on
one
condition
and
that
condition
is
that
you
allow
yourselves
to
be
blindfolded
in
this
room
and
conducted
by
my
servants
to
the
harbour
side
i
must
furthermore
ask
your
words
of
honour
that
you
will
not
seek
to
remove
your
bandages
until
you
are
given
permission
to
do
so
do
you
agree
to
this
needless
to
say
we
both
signified
our
assent
this
free
permission
to
leave
the
house
was
a
second
surprise
and
one
for
which
we
were
totally
unprepared
then
let
it
be
so
believe
me
my
lord
marquis
and
you
hatteras
it
is
with
the
utmost
pleasure
i
restore
your
liberty
to
you
again
he
made
a
sign
to
prendergast
who
instantly
stepped
forward
but
i
had
something
to
say
before
we
were
removed
one
word
first
nikola
you
have
hatteras
if
you
will
be
guided
by
me
you
will
keep
a
silent
tongue
in
your
head
let
well
alone
take
warning
by
the
proverb
and
beware
how
you
disturb
a
sleeping
dog
why
i
have
acted
as
i
have
done
towards
you
you
may
some
day
learn
in
the
meantime
rest
assured
it
was
from
no
idle
motive
now
take
me
at
my
word
and
go
while
you
have
the
chance
i
may
change
my
mind
in
a
moment
and
then
he
stopped
and
did
not
say
any
more
at
a
sign
prendergast
clapped
a
thick
bandage
over
my
eyes
while
another
man
did
the
same
for
beckenham
a
man
on
either
side
of
me
took
my
arms
and
next
moment
we
had
passed
out
of
the
room
and
before
i
could
have
counted
fifty
were
in
the
cool
air
of
the
street
how
long
we
were
walking
after
leaving
the
house
i
could
not
say
but
at
last
our
escort
called
a
halt
prendergast
was
evidently
in
command
for
he
said
gentlemen
before
we
leave
you
you
will
renew
your
words
of
honour
not
to
remove
your
bandages
for
five
full
minutes
we
complied
with
his
request
and
instantly
our
arms
were
released
a
moment
later
we
heard
our
captors
leaving
us
the
minutes
went
slowly
by
presently
beckenham
said
how
long
do
you
think
we
been
standing
here
nearly
the
stipulated
time
i
should
fancy
i
answered
however
better
give
them
a
little
longer
to
avoid
any
chance
of
mistake
again
a
silence
fell
on
us
then
i
tore
off
my
bandage
to
find
beckenham
doing
the
same
they
gone
and
we
free
again
he
cried
hurrah
we
shook
hands
warmly
on
our
escape
and
having
done
so
looked
about
us
a
ship
bell
out
in
the
stream
chimed
half
an
hour
after
midnight
and
a
precious
dark
night
it
was
a
number
of
vessels
were
to
be
seen
and
from
the
noise
that
came
from
them
it
was
evident
they
were
busy
coaling
what
to
be
done
now
asked
beckenham
find
an
hotel
i
think
i
answered
get
a
good
night
rest
and
first
thing
in
the
morning
hunt
up
our
consul
and
the
steamship
authorities
come
along
then
let
look
for
a
place
i
noticed
one
that
should
suit
us
close
to
where
we
came
ashore
that
day
five
minutes
walking
brought
us
to
the
house
we
sought
the
proprietor
was
not
very
fastidious
and
whatever
he
may
have
thought
of
our
appearances
he
took
us
in
without
demur
a
bath
and
a
good
meal
followed
and
then
after
a
thorough
overhauling
of
all
the
details
connected
with
our
imprisonment
we
turned
into
bed
resolved
to
thrash
it
out
upon
the
morrow
next
morning
true
to
our
arrangement
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
i
set
off
for
the
steamship
company
office
leaving
the
marquis
behind
me
at
the
hotel
for
reasons
which
had
begun
to
commend
themselves
to
me
and
which
will
be
quite
apparent
to
you
i
found
the
agent
hard
at
work
in
his
private
office
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
slightly
bald
wearing
a
pair
of
heavy
gold
and
very
slow
and
deliberate
in
speech
i
beg
your
pardon
he
began
when
i
had
taken
possession
of
his
proffered
chair
but
did
i
understand
my
clerk
to
say
that
your
name
was
hatteras
that
is
my
name
i
answered
i
was
a
passenger
in
the
for
australia
three
weeks
ago
but
had
the
misfortune
to
be
left
behind
when
she
sailed
ah
i
remember
the
circumstances
thoroughly
he
said
the
young
marquis
of
beckenham
went
ashore
with
you
i
think
and
came
within
an
ace
of
being
also
left
behind
within
an
ace
i
cried
but
he
left
behind
no
no
there
you
are
mistaken
was
the
astounding
reply
he
have
been
left
behind
had
not
his
tutor
and
i
gone
ashore
at
the
last
moment
to
look
for
him
and
found
him
wandering
about
on
the
outskirts
of
arab
town
i
do
remember
ever
to
have
seen
a
man
more
angry
than
the
tutor
was
and
no
wonder
for
they
only
just
got
out
to
the
boat
again
as
the
gangway
was
being
hauled
aboard
then
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
marquis
went
on
to
australia
after
all
i
cried
and
pray
how
did
this
interesting
young
gentleman
explain
the
fact
of
his
losing
sight
of
me
he
lost
you
in
a
crowd
he
said
the
agent
continued
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
business
altogether
it
certainly
was
and
even
more
extraordinary
than
he
imagined
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
the
world
seemed
to
be
turned
upside
down
i
was
so
bewildered
that
i
stumbled
out
a
few
lame
inquiries
about
the
next
boat
sailing
for
australia
and
what
would
be
done
with
my
baggage
and
then
made
my
way
as
best
i
could
out
of
the
office
hastening
back
to
the
hotel
i
told
my
story
from
beginning
to
end
to
my
astonished
companion
who
sat
on
his
bed
listening
when
i
had
finished
he
said
feebly
but
what
does
it
all
mean
tell
me
that
what
does
it
mean
it
means
i
answered
that
our
notion
about
nikola
abducting
us
in
order
to
blackmail
your
father
was
altogether
wrong
and
if
you
ask
me
i
should
say
not
half
picturesque
enough
no
no
this
mystery
is
a
bigger
one
by
a
hundred
times
than
even
we
expected
and
there
are
more
men
in
it
than
those
we
have
yet
seen
it
remains
with
you
to
say
whether
you
will
assist
in
the
attempt
to
unravel
it
or
not
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
it
remains
with
me
do
i
understand
that
you
intend
following
it
up
of
course
i
do
nikola
and
baxter
between
them
have
completely
done
me
now
i
going
to
do
my
best
to
do
them
by
jove
what
is
it
now
i
see
it
all
as
plain
as
a
pikestaff
i
understand
exactly
now
why
baxter
came
for
you
why
he
telegraphed
that
the
train
was
laid
why
i
was
drugged
in
plymouth
why
you
were
between
naples
and
this
place
and
why
we
were
both
kidnapped
then
explain
for
mercy
sake
i
will
see
here
in
the
first
place
remember
your
father
peculiar
education
of
yourself
if
you
consider
that
you
will
see
that
you
are
the
only
young
nobleman
of
high
rank
whose
face
is
not
well
known
to
his
brother
peers
that
being
so
nikola
wants
to
procure
you
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
in
australia
your
father
advertises
for
a
tutor
he
sends
one
of
his
agents
baxter
to
secure
the
position
baxter
at
nikola
instruction
puts
into
your
head
a
desire
for
travel
you
pester
your
father
for
the
necessary
permission
just
as
this
is
granted
i
come
upon
the
scene
baxter
suspects
me
he
telegraphs
to
nikola
train
is
laid
which
means
that
he
has
begun
to
sow
the
seeds
of
a
desire
for
travel
when
a
third
party
steps
in
in
other
words
i
am
the
new
danger
that
has
arisen
he
arranges
your
sailing
and
all
promises
to
go
well
then
nikola
finds
out
i
intend
going
in
the
same
boat
he
tries
to
prevent
me
and
i
by
jove
i
see
another
thing
why
did
baxter
suggest
that
you
should
cross
the
continent
and
join
the
boat
at
naples
why
simply
because
if
you
had
started
from
plymouth
you
would
soon
have
got
over
your
sickness
if
you
had
ever
been
ill
at
all
and
in
that
case
the
passengers
would
have
become
thoroughly
familiar
with
your
face
by
the
time
you
reached
port
said
that
would
never
have
done
so
he
takes
you
to
naples
drugs
you
next
morning
for
you
must
remember
you
were
ill
after
the
coffee
he
gave
you
and
by
that
means
kept
you
ill
and
confined
to
your
cabin
throughout
the
entire
passage
to
port
said
then
he
persuades
you
to
go
ashore
with
me
you
do
so
with
what
result
you
know
presently
he
begins
to
bewail
your
invites
the
agent
to
help
in
the
search
they
set
off
and
eventually
find
you
near
the
arab
quarter
you
must
remember
that
neither
the
agent
the
captain
nor
the
passengers
have
seen
you
save
at
night
so
the
substitute
who
is
certain
to
have
been
well
chosen
and
schooled
for
the
part
he
is
to
play
is
not
detected
then
the
boat
goes
on
her
way
while
we
are
left
behind
languishing
in
durance
vile
what
do
you
advise
me
to
do
remember
baxter
has
letters
to
the
different
governors
from
my
father
i
know
what
i
should
do
myself
go
to
the
consul
and
get
him
to
warn
the
authorities
in
australia
i
suppose
no
that
would
do
little
or
no
good
remember
they
got
three
start
of
us
then
what
shall
we
do
i
in
your
hands
entirely
and
whatever
you
advise
i
promise
you
i
do
if
i
were
you
i
should
doff
my
title
take
another
name
and
set
sail
with
me
for
australia
once
there
we
put
up
in
some
quiet
place
and
set
ourselves
to
unmask
these
rascals
and
to
defeat
their
little
game
whatever
it
may
be
are
you
prepared
for
so
much
excitement
as
that
of
course
i
am
come
what
may
i
go
with
you
and
there
my
hand
on
it
then
we
catch
the
next
boat
not
a
that
sails
for
an
australian
port
and
once
ashore
there
we
set
the
ball
with
a
vengeance
that
scoundrel
baxter
i
not
vindictive
as
a
rule
but
i
feel
i
should
like
to
punish
him
well
if
they
not
flown
by
the
time
we
reach
australia
probably
be
able
to
gratify
your
wish
it
nikola
however
i
want
beckenham
shuddered
as
i
mentioned
the
doctor
name
so
to
change
the
subject
i
said
i
thinking
of
taking
a
little
walk
would
you
care
to
accompany
me
where
are
you
going
he
asked
i
going
to
try
and
find
the
house
where
we
were
shut
up
i
answered
i
want
to
be
able
to
locate
it
for
future
reference
if
necessary
is
it
safe
to
go
near
it
do
you
think
in
broad
daylight
yes
but
just
to
make
sure
we
buy
a
couple
of
revolvers
on
the
way
and
what
more
if
it
becomes
necessary
use
them
come
along
then
with
that
we
left
our
hotel
and
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
casino
stopping
however
on
the
way
to
make
the
purchases
above
referred
to
we
passed
down
one
thoroughfare
and
up
another
and
at
last
reached
the
spot
where
i
had
commented
on
the
and
where
we
had
been
garrotted
surely
the
house
must
be
near
at
hand
now
but
though
we
hunted
high
and
low
up
one
street
and
down
another
not
a
single
trace
of
any
building
answering
the
description
of
the
one
we
wanted
could
we
discover
at
last
after
nearly
an
hour
search
we
were
obliged
to
give
it
up
and
return
to
our
hotel
unsuccessful
as
we
finished
lunch
a
large
steamer
made
her
appearance
in
the
harbour
and
brought
up
opposite
the
town
when
we
questioned
our
landlord
who
was
an
authority
on
the
subject
he
informed
us
that
she
was
the
of
hull
bound
to
melbourne
hearing
this
we
immediately
chartered
a
boat
pulled
off
to
her
and
interviewed
the
captain
as
good
luck
would
have
it
he
had
room
for
a
couple
of
passengers
we
therefore
paid
the
passage
money
went
ashore
again
and
provided
ourselves
with
a
few
necessaries
rejoined
her
and
shortly
before
nightfall
steamed
into
the
canal
port
said
was
a
thing
of
the
past
our
eventful
journey
was
resumed
what
was
the
end
of
it
all
to
be
chapter
i
we
reach
australia
and
the
result
the
if
she
was
slow
was
certainly
sure
and
so
the
day
after
our
departure
from
port
said
as
recorded
in
the
previous
chapter
she
landed
us
safe
and
sound
at
williamstown
which
as
all
the
australian
world
knows
is
one
of
the
principal
railway
termini
and
within
an
hour
journey
of
melbourne
throughout
the
voyage
nothing
occurred
worth
chronicling
if
i
except
the
curious
behaviour
of
lord
beckenham
who
for
the
first
week
or
so
seemed
sunk
in
a
deep
lethargy
from
which
neither
chaff
nor
sympathy
could
rouse
him
from
morning
till
night
he
mooned
aimlessly
about
the
decks
had
visibly
to
pull
himself
together
to
answer
such
questions
as
might
be
addressed
to
him
and
never
by
any
chance
sustained
a
conversation
beyond
a
few
odd
sentences
to
such
a
pitch
did
this
depression
at
last
bring
him
that
the
day
after
we
left
aden
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
take
him
to
task
and
to
try
to
bully
or
coax
him
out
of
it
come
i
said
i
want
to
know
what
the
matter
with
you
you
been
giving
us
all
the
miserables
lately
and
from
the
look
of
your
face
at
the
present
moment
i
inclined
to
believe
it
going
to
continue
out
with
it
are
you
homesick
or
has
the
monotony
of
this
voyage
been
too
much
for
you
he
looked
into
my
face
rather
anxiously
i
thought
and
then
said
hatteras
i
afraid
you
think
me
an
awful
idiot
when
i
tell
you
but
the
truth
is
i
got
nikola
face
on
my
brain
and
do
what
i
will
i
can
not
rid
myself
of
it
those
great
searching
eyes
as
we
saw
them
in
that
terrible
room
have
got
on
my
nerves
and
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
they
haunt
me
night
and
day
oh
that
all
fancy
i
cried
why
on
earth
should
you
be
frightened
of
him
nikola
in
spite
of
his
demoniacal
cleverness
is
only
a
man
and
even
then
you
may
consider
that
we
seen
the
last
of
him
so
cheer
up
take
as
much
exercise
as
you
possibly
can
and
believe
me
soon
forget
all
about
him
but
it
was
no
use
arguing
with
him
nikola
had
had
an
effect
upon
the
youth
that
was
little
short
of
marvellous
and
it
was
not
until
we
had
well
turned
the
leuwin
and
were
safely
in
australian
waters
that
he
in
any
way
recovered
his
former
spirits
and
here
lest
you
should
give
me
credit
for
a
bravery
i
did
not
possess
i
must
own
that
i
was
more
than
a
little
afraid
of
another
meeting
with
nikola
myself
i
had
had
four
opportunities
afforded
me
of
judging
of
his
cleverness
once
in
the
restaurant
off
oxford
street
once
in
the
in
the
east
india
dock
road
once
in
the
west
of
england
express
and
lastly
in
the
house
in
port
said
i
had
no
desire
therefore
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
him
again
arriving
in
melbourne
we
caught
the
afternoon
express
for
sydney
reaching
that
city
the
following
morning
a
little
after
breakfast
by
the
time
we
had
arrived
at
our
destination
we
had
held
many
consultations
over
our
future
and
the
result
was
a
decision
to
look
for
a
quiet
hotel
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
and
then
to
attempt
to
discover
what
the
mystery
in
which
we
had
been
so
deeply
involved
might
mean
the
merits
of
all
the
various
suburbs
were
severally
discussed
though
i
knew
but
little
about
them
and
the
marquis
less
paramatta
penrith
woolahra
balmain
and
even
many
of
the
bays
and
harbours
received
attention
until
we
decided
on
the
last
named
as
the
most
likely
place
to
answer
our
purpose
this
settled
we
crossed
darling
harbour
and
after
a
little
hunting
about
discovered
a
small
but
comfortable
hotel
situated
in
a
side
street
called
the
here
we
booked
rooms
deposited
our
meagre
baggage
and
having
installed
ourselves
sat
down
and
discussed
the
situation
so
this
is
sydney
said
beckenham
stretching
himself
out
comfortably
upon
the
sofa
as
he
spoke
and
now
that
we
got
here
what
to
be
done
first
have
lunch
i
answered
promptly
and
then
he
continued
hunt
up
the
public
library
and
take
a
glimpse
of
the
back
numbers
they
will
tell
us
a
good
deal
though
not
all
we
want
to
know
then
we
make
a
few
inquiries
morning
i
shall
ask
you
to
excuse
me
for
a
couple
of
hours
but
in
the
afternoon
we
ought
to
have
acquired
sufficient
information
to
enable
us
to
make
a
definite
start
then
let
have
lunch
at
once
and
be
off
i
all
eagerness
to
get
to
work
we
accordingly
ordered
lunch
and
when
it
was
finished
set
off
in
search
of
a
public
library
having
found
it
and
it
was
not
a
very
difficult
matter
we
sought
the
reading
room
and
made
for
a
stand
of
morning
in
the
corner
somehow
i
felt
as
certain
of
finding
what
i
wanted
there
as
any
man
could
possibly
be
and
as
it
happened
i
was
not
disappointed
on
the
second
page
beneath
a
heading
in
bold
type
was
a
long
report
of
a
horse
show
held
the
previous
afternoon
at
which
it
appeared
a
large
and
fashionable
party
were
present
the
list
included
his
excellency
the
governor
and
the
countess
of
amberley
the
ladies
maud
and
ermyntrude
their
daughters
the
marquis
of
beckenham
captain
barrenden
an
and
baxter
in
a
voice
that
i
hardly
recognized
as
my
own
so
shaken
was
it
with
excitement
i
called
beckenham
to
my
side
and
pointed
out
to
him
his
name
he
stared
looked
away
then
stared
again
hardly
able
to
believe
his
eyes
what
does
it
mean
he
whispered
just
as
he
had
done
in
port
said
what
does
it
mean
i
led
him
out
of
the
building
before
i
answered
and
then
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
it
means
my
boy
i
said
that
there
been
a
hitch
in
their
arrangements
and
that
we
not
too
late
to
circumvent
them
after
all
but
where
do
you
think
they
are
staying
these
two
scoundrels
at
government
house
to
be
sure
did
you
see
that
the
report
said
earl
and
countess
of
amberley
and
a
distinguished
party
from
government
house
including
the
marquis
of
beckenham
then
let
us
go
to
government
house
at
once
and
unmask
them
that
is
our
bounden
duty
to
society
then
all
i
can
say
is
if
it
is
our
duty
to
society
society
will
have
to
wait
no
no
we
must
find
out
first
what
their
little
game
is
that
once
decided
the
unmasking
will
fall
in
as
a
natural
consequence
you
understand
i
am
afraid
i
do
quite
however
i
expect
you
right
by
this
time
we
were
back
again
at
the
ferry
it
was
not
time
for
the
boat
to
start
so
while
we
waited
we
amused
ourselves
staring
at
the
placards
pasted
about
on
the
wharf
hoardings
then
a
large
theatrical
poster
caught
my
eye
and
drew
me
towards
it
it
announced
a
grand
command
night
at
one
of
the
principal
theatres
for
that
very
evening
and
further
set
forth
the
fact
that
the
most
noble
the
marquis
of
beckenham
would
be
amongst
the
distinguished
company
here
we
are
i
called
to
my
companion
who
was
at
a
little
distance
we
certainly
go
to
this
the
marquis
of
beckenham
shall
honour
it
with
his
patronage
and
presence
after
all
we
went
back
to
our
hotel
for
dinner
and
as
soon
as
it
was
eaten
returned
to
the
city
to
seek
the
theatre
when
we
entered
it
the
building
was
crowded
and
the
arrival
of
the
government
house
party
was
momentarily
expected
presently
the
governor
and
a
brilliant
party
entered
the
box
you
may
be
sure
of
all
that
vast
concourse
of
people
there
were
none
who
stared
harder
then
beckenham
and
myself
and
it
was
certainly
enough
to
make
any
man
stare
for
there
sitting
on
her
ladyship
right
hand
faultlessly
dressed
was
the
exact
image
of
the
young
man
by
my
side
the
likeness
was
so
extraordinary
that
for
a
moment
i
could
hardly
believe
that
beckenham
had
not
left
me
to
go
up
and
take
his
seat
there
and
if
i
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
you
may
be
sure
that
he
was
a
dozen
times
more
so
indeed
his
bewilderment
was
most
comical
and
must
have
struck
those
people
round
us
who
were
watching
as
something
altogether
extraordinary
i
looked
again
and
could
just
discern
behind
the
front
row
the
smug
face
of
the
tutor
baxter
then
the
play
commenced
and
we
were
compelled
to
turn
and
give
it
our
attention
here
i
must
stop
to
chronicle
one
circumstance
that
throughout
the
day
had
struck
me
as
peculiar
when
our
vessel
arrived
at
williamstown
it
so
happened
that
we
had
travelled
up
in
the
train
to
melbourne
with
a
tall
handsome
man
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
whether
he
like
ourselves
was
a
new
arrival
in
the
colony
and
only
passing
through
melbourne
i
can
not
say
at
any
rate
he
went
on
to
sydney
in
the
mail
train
with
us
then
we
lost
sight
of
him
only
to
find
him
standing
near
the
public
library
when
we
had
emerged
from
it
that
afternoon
and
now
here
he
was
sitting
in
the
stalls
of
the
theatre
not
half
a
dozen
chairs
from
us
whether
this
continual
companionship
was
designed
or
only
accidental
i
could
not
of
course
say
but
i
must
own
that
i
did
not
like
the
look
of
it
could
it
be
possible
i
asked
myself
that
nikola
learning
our
departure
for
australia
in
the
had
cabled
from
port
said
to
this
man
to
watch
us
the
performance
over
we
left
the
theatre
and
set
off
for
the
ferry
only
reaching
it
just
as
the
boat
was
casting
off
as
it
was
i
had
to
jump
for
it
and
on
reaching
the
deck
should
have
fallen
in
a
heap
but
for
a
helping
hand
that
was
stretched
out
to
me
i
looked
up
to
tender
my
thanks
when
to
my
surprise
i
discovered
that
my
benefactor
was
none
other
than
the
man
to
whom
i
have
just
been
referring
his
surprise
was
even
greater
than
mine
and
muttering
something
about
a
close
shave
he
turned
and
walked
quickly
aft
my
mind
was
now
made
up
and
i
accordingly
reported
my
discovery
to
beckenham
pointing
out
the
man
and
warning
him
to
watch
for
him
when
he
was
abroad
without
me
this
he
promised
to
do
next
morning
i
donned
my
best
attire
my
luggage
having
safely
arrived
and
shortly
before
eleven
bade
beckenham
and
betook
myself
to
potts
point
to
call
upon
the
wetherells
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
say
with
what
varied
emotions
i
trod
that
street
crossed
the
garden
and
approached
the
ponderous
front
door
which
somehow
had
always
seemed
to
me
so
typical
of
wetherell
himself
the
same
butler
who
had
opened
the
door
to
me
on
the
previous
occasion
opened
it
now
and
when
i
asked
if
miss
wetherell
were
at
home
he
gravely
answered
yes
sir
and
invited
me
to
enter
i
was
shown
into
the
a
large
double
chamber
beautifully
furnished
and
possessing
an
elegantly
painted
ceiling
while
the
butler
went
in
search
of
his
mistress
a
few
moments
later
i
heard
a
light
footstep
outside
a
hand
was
placed
upon
the
handle
of
the
door
and
before
i
could
have
counted
ten
phyllis
my
phyllis
was
in
the
room
and
in
my
arms
over
the
next
five
minutes
gentle
reader
we
will
draw
a
curtain
with
your
kind
permission
if
you
have
ever
met
your
sweetheart
after
an
absence
of
several
months
you
will
readily
understand
why
when
we
had
become
rational
again
i
led
her
to
a
sofa
and
seating
myself
beside
her
asked
if
her
father
had
in
any
way
relented
at
this
she
looked
very
unhappy
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
was
going
to
burst
into
tears
why
what
is
the
matter
phyllis
my
darling
i
cried
in
sincere
alarm
what
is
troubling
you
oh
i
am
so
unhappy
she
replied
dick
there
is
a
gentleman
in
sydney
now
to
whom
papa
has
taken
an
enormous
fancy
and
he
is
exerting
all
his
influence
over
me
to
induce
me
to
marry
him
the
deuce
he
is
and
pray
who
may
but
i
got
no
farther
in
my
inquiries
for
at
that
moment
i
caught
the
sound
of
a
footstep
in
the
hall
and
next
moment
wetherell
opened
the
door
he
remained
for
a
brief
period
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
without
speaking
then
he
advanced
saying
hatteras
please
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
when
this
persecution
will
cease
am
i
not
even
to
be
free
of
you
in
my
own
house
flesh
and
blood
wo
stand
it
i
tell
you
sir
wo
stand
it
you
pursued
my
daughter
to
england
in
a
most
ungentlemanly
fashion
and
now
you
have
followed
her
out
here
again
just
as
i
shall
continue
to
follow
her
all
my
life
wetherell
i
replied
warmly
wherever
you
may
take
her
i
told
you
on
board
the
months
ago
that
i
loved
her
well
i
love
her
ten
thousand
times
more
now
she
loves
me
wo
you
hear
her
tell
you
so
why
then
should
you
endeavour
to
keep
us
apart
because
an
alliance
with
you
sir
is
distasteful
to
me
in
every
possible
way
i
have
other
views
for
my
daughter
you
must
learn
here
phyllis
could
keep
silence
no
longer
and
broke
in
with
if
you
mean
by
that
that
you
will
force
me
into
this
hateful
marriage
with
a
man
i
despise
papa
you
are
mistaken
i
will
marry
no
one
but
hatteras
and
so
i
warn
you
silence
miss
how
dare
you
adopt
that
tone
with
me
you
will
do
as
i
wish
in
this
and
all
other
matters
and
so
we
have
no
more
talk
about
it
now
hatteras
you
have
heard
what
i
have
to
say
and
i
warn
you
that
if
you
persist
in
this
conduct
i
see
if
something
ca
be
found
in
the
law
to
put
a
stop
to
it
meanwhile
if
you
show
yourself
in
my
grounds
again
i
have
my
servants
throw
you
out
into
the
street
unjust
as
his
conduct
was
to
me
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
so
picking
up
my
hat
i
bade
poor
little
frightened
phyllis
farewell
and
went
towards
the
door
but
before
taking
my
departure
i
was
determined
to
have
one
final
shot
at
her
irascible
parent
so
i
said
wetherell
i
have
warned
you
before
and
i
do
so
again
your
daughter
loves
me
and
come
what
may
i
will
make
her
my
wife
she
is
her
own
mistress
and
you
can
not
force
her
into
marrying
any
one
against
her
will
neither
can
you
prevent
her
marrying
me
if
she
wishes
it
you
will
be
sorry
some
day
that
you
have
behaved
like
this
to
me
but
the
only
answer
he
vouchsafed
was
a
stormy
one
leave
my
house
this
instant
he
said
not
another
word
sir
or
i
call
my
servants
to
my
assistance
the
stately
old
butler
opened
the
front
door
for
me
and
assuming
as
dignified
an
air
as
was
possible
i
went
down
the
drive
and
passed
out
into
the
street
when
i
reached
home
again
beckenham
was
out
for
which
i
was
not
sorry
as
i
wanted
to
have
a
good
quiet
think
by
myself
so
lighting
a
cigar
i
pulled
a
chair
into
the
verandah
and
fell
to
work
but
i
could
make
nothing
of
the
situation
save
that
by
my
interview
this
morning
my
position
with
the
father
was
if
possible
rendered
even
more
hopeless
than
before
who
was
this
more
fortunate
suitor
would
it
be
any
use
my
going
to
him
and
but
no
that
was
clearly
impossible
could
i
induce
phyllis
to
run
away
with
me
that
was
possible
of
course
but
i
rather
doubted
if
she
would
care
to
take
such
an
extreme
step
until
every
other
means
had
proved
unsuccessful
then
what
was
to
be
done
i
began
to
wish
that
beckenham
would
return
in
order
that
we
might
consult
together
half
an
hour
later
our
lunch
was
ready
but
still
no
sign
came
of
the
youth
where
could
he
have
got
to
i
waited
an
hour
and
then
fell
to
work
three
arrived
and
still
no
sign
four
five
and
even
six
by
this
time
i
was
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
i
remembered
the
existence
of
the
man
who
had
followed
us
from
melbourne
and
beckenham
trusting
good
nature
then
and
there
i
resolved
if
he
did
not
return
before
seven
to
set
off
for
the
nearest
and
have
a
search
made
for
him
slowly
the
large
hand
of
the
clock
went
round
and
when
at
the
time
stated
he
had
not
appeared
i
donned
my
hat
and
inquiring
the
way
set
off
for
the
home
of
the
law
on
arriving
there
and
stating
my
business
i
was
immediately
conducted
to
the
inspector
in
charge
who
questioned
me
very
closely
as
to
beckenham
appearance
age
profession
etc
having
done
this
he
said
but
what
reason
have
you
sir
for
supposing
that
the
young
man
has
been
done
away
with
he
has
only
been
absent
from
his
abode
according
to
your
statement
about
eight
or
nine
hours
simply
because
i
answered
i
have
the
best
of
reasons
for
knowing
that
ever
since
his
arrival
in
australia
he
has
been
shadowed
this
morning
he
said
he
would
only
go
for
a
short
stroll
before
lunch
and
i
am
positively
certain
knowing
my
anxiety
about
him
he
would
not
have
remained
away
so
long
of
his
own
accord
without
communicating
with
me
is
there
any
motive
you
can
assign
for
this
shadowing
my
friend
is
heir
to
an
enormous
property
in
england
perhaps
that
may
assist
you
in
discovering
one
very
possibly
but
still
i
am
inclined
to
think
you
are
a
little
hasty
in
coming
to
so
terrible
a
conclusion
mr
hatteras
is
my
name
and
i
am
staying
at
the
officer
in
palgrave
street
well
hatteras
if
i
were
you
i
would
go
back
to
your
hotel
you
will
probably
find
your
friend
there
eating
his
dinner
and
thinking
about
instituting
a
search
for
you
if
however
he
has
not
turned
up
and
does
not
do
so
by
morning
call
here
again
and
report
the
matter
and
i
will
give
you
every
assistance
thanking
him
for
his
courtesy
i
left
the
station
and
walked
quickly
back
to
the
hotel
hoping
to
find
beckenham
safely
returned
and
at
his
dinner
but
when
the
landlady
met
me
in
the
verandah
and
asked
if
i
had
any
news
of
my
friend
i
realized
that
a
disappointment
was
in
store
for
me
by
this
time
the
excitement
and
worry
were
getting
too
much
for
me
what
with
nikola
the
spy
beckenham
phyllis
the
unknown
lover
and
old
wetherell
i
had
more
than
enough
to
keep
my
brain
occupied
i
sat
down
on
a
chair
on
the
verandah
with
a
sigh
and
reviewed
the
whole
case
nine
struck
by
the
time
my
reverie
was
finished
just
as
i
did
so
a
newspaper
boy
came
down
the
street
lustily
crying
his
wares
to
divert
my
mind
from
its
unpleasant
thoughts
i
called
him
up
and
bought
an
having
done
so
i
passed
into
my
to
read
it
the
first
second
and
third
pages
held
nothing
of
much
interest
to
me
but
on
the
fourth
was
an
item
which
was
astonishing
enough
to
almost
make
my
hair
stand
on
end
it
ran
as
follows
important
engagement
in
high
life
we
have
it
on
the
very
best
authority
that
an
engagement
will
shortly
be
announced
between
a
certain
illustrious
young
nobleman
now
a
visitor
in
our
city
and
the
beautiful
daughter
of
one
of
sydney
most
prominent
politicians
who
has
lately
returned
from
a
visit
to
england
the
tenders
the
young
couple
their
sincerest
congratulations
this
be
the
solution
of
the
whole
mystery
could
it
be
that
the
engagement
of
baxter
the
telegram
the
idea
of
travel
the
drugging
the
imprisonment
in
port
said
the
substitution
of
the
false
marquis
were
all
means
to
this
end
was
is
possible
that
this
man
who
was
masquerading
as
a
man
of
title
was
to
marry
phyllis
for
there
could
be
no
possible
doubt
as
to
the
person
to
whom
that
paragraph
referred
the
very
thought
of
such
a
thing
was
not
to
be
endured
there
must
be
no
delay
now
i
told
myself
in
revealing
all
i
knew
the
villains
must
be
unmasked
this
very
night
wetherell
should
know
all
as
soon
as
i
could
tell
him
as
i
came
to
this
conclusion
i
crushed
my
paper
into
my
pocket
and
set
off
without
a
moment
delay
for
potts
point
the
night
was
dark
and
now
a
thick
drizzle
was
falling
though
it
really
did
not
take
me
very
long
it
seemed
an
eternity
before
i
reached
the
house
and
rang
the
bell
the
butler
opened
the
door
and
was
evidently
surprised
to
see
me
is
wetherell
at
home
i
asked
for
a
moment
he
looked
doubtful
as
to
what
he
should
say
then
compromising
matters
answered
that
he
would
see
i
know
what
that
means
i
said
in
reply
wetherell
is
in
but
you
do
think
he
see
me
but
he
must
i
have
news
for
him
of
the
very
utmost
importance
will
you
tell
him
that
he
left
me
and
went
along
the
hall
and
upstairs
presently
he
returned
shaking
his
head
i
am
very
sorry
sir
but
wetherell
answer
is
if
you
have
anything
to
tell
him
you
must
put
it
in
writing
he
can
not
see
you
but
he
must
in
this
case
i
can
accept
no
refusal
tell
him
will
you
that
the
matter
upon
which
i
wish
to
speak
to
him
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
request
i
made
to
him
this
morning
i
pledge
him
my
word
on
that
again
the
butler
departed
and
once
more
i
was
left
to
cool
my
heels
in
the
portico
when
he
returned
it
was
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
wetherell
will
be
glad
if
you
will
step
this
way
sir
i
followed
him
along
the
hall
and
up
the
massive
stone
staircase
arriving
at
the
top
he
opened
a
door
on
the
side
and
announced
mr
hatteras
i
found
wetherell
seated
in
a
low
chair
opposite
the
fire
and
from
the
fact
that
his
right
foot
was
resting
on
a
sort
of
small
trestle
i
argued
that
he
was
suffering
from
an
attack
of
his
old
enemy
the
gout
be
good
enough
to
take
a
chair
hatteras
he
said
when
the
door
had
been
closed
i
must
own
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
you
can
have
to
tell
me
of
so
much
importance
as
to
bring
you
to
my
house
at
this
time
of
night
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
satisfy
you
on
that
score
wetherell
i
replied
taking
the
from
my
pocket
and
smoothing
it
out
in
the
first
place
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
inference
contained
in
that
paragraph
i
handed
the
paper
to
him
and
pointed
to
the
lines
in
question
having
put
on
his
glasses
he
examined
it
carefully
i
am
sorry
they
should
have
made
it
public
so
soon
i
must
admit
he
said
but
i
do
deny
that
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
truth
in
what
that
paragraph
reports
you
mean
by
that
that
you
intend
to
try
and
marry
phyllis
to
the
marquis
of
beckenham
the
young
man
has
paid
her
a
very
considerable
amount
of
attention
ever
since
he
arrived
in
the
colony
and
only
last
week
he
did
me
the
honour
of
confiding
his
views
to
me
you
see
i
am
candid
with
you
i
thank
you
for
it
i
too
will
be
candid
with
you
wetherell
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
at
once
this
marriage
will
never
take
place
and
pray
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
your
reason
for
such
a
statement
if
you
want
it
bluntly
because
the
young
man
now
staying
at
government
house
is
no
more
the
marquis
of
beckenham
than
i
am
he
is
a
fraud
an
impostor
a
cheat
of
the
first
water
put
up
to
play
his
part
by
one
of
the
cleverest
scoundrels
unhung
hatteras
this
is
really
going
too
far
i
can
quite
understand
your
being
jealous
of
his
lordship
but
i
can
not
understand
your
having
the
audacity
to
bring
such
a
foolish
charge
against
him
i
for
one
must
decline
to
listen
to
it
if
he
had
been
the
fraud
you
make
him
out
how
would
his
tutor
have
got
those
letters
from
his
grace
the
duke
of
glenbarth
do
you
imagine
his
excellency
the
governor
who
has
known
the
family
all
his
life
would
not
have
discovered
him
ere
this
no
no
sir
it
wo
do
if
you
think
so
who
has
schooled
him
so
cleverly
who
has
pulled
the
strings
so
wonderfully
why
nikola
to
be
sure
had
i
clapped
a
revolver
to
the
old
gentleman
head
or
had
the
walls
opened
and
nikola
himself
stepped
into
the
room
a
greater
effect
of
terror
and
consternation
could
not
have
been
produced
in
the
old
gentleman
face
than
did
those
five
simple
words
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
gasping
for
breath
his
complexion
became
ashen
in
its
pallor
and
for
a
moment
his
whole
nervous
system
seemed
unstrung
i
sprang
to
his
assistance
thinking
he
was
going
to
have
a
fit
but
he
waived
me
off
and
when
he
had
recovered
himself
sufficiently
to
speak
said
hoarsely
what
do
you
know
of
nikola
tell
me
for
sake
what
do
you
know
of
him
quick
quick
thereupon
i
set
to
work
and
told
him
my
story
from
the
day
of
my
arrival
in
sydney
from
thursday
island
up
to
the
moment
of
my
reaching
his
house
described
my
meeting
and
acquaintance
with
the
real
beckenham
and
all
the
events
consequent
upon
it
he
listened
with
an
awful
terror
growing
in
his
face
and
when
i
had
finished
my
narrative
with
the
disappearance
of
my
friend
he
nearly
choked
hatteras
he
gasped
will
you
swear
this
is
the
truth
you
are
telling
me
i
solemnly
swear
it
i
answered
and
will
do
so
in
public
when
and
where
you
please
then
before
i
do
anything
else
i
will
beg
your
pardon
for
my
conduct
to
you
you
have
taken
a
noble
revenge
i
can
not
thank
you
sufficiently
but
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
my
daughter
is
at
a
ball
at
government
house
at
the
present
moment
i
should
have
accompanied
her
but
my
gout
would
not
permit
me
will
you
oblige
me
by
ringing
that
bell
i
rang
the
bell
as
requested
and
then
asked
what
he
intended
doing
going
off
to
his
excellency
at
once
gout
or
no
gout
and
telling
him
what
you
have
told
me
if
it
is
as
you
have
said
we
must
catch
these
scoundrels
and
rescue
your
friend
without
an
instant
delay
half
an
hour
later
we
were
at
government
house
waiting
in
his
excellency
study
for
an
interview
the
music
of
the
orchestra
in
the
came
faintly
in
to
us
and
when
lord
amberley
entered
the
room
he
seemed
surprised
as
well
he
might
be
to
see
us
but
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
what
we
had
to
tell
him
his
expression
changed
wetherell
this
is
a
very
terrible
charge
you
bring
against
my
guest
do
you
think
it
can
possibly
be
true
i
sadly
fear
so
said
wetherell
but
perhaps
hatteras
will
tell
you
the
story
as
he
told
it
to
me
i
did
so
and
when
i
had
finished
the
governor
went
to
the
door
and
called
a
servant
find
lord
beckenham
johnson
at
once
and
ask
him
to
be
so
good
as
to
come
to
me
here
stay
on
second
thoughts
i
go
and
look
for
him
myself
he
went
off
leaving
us
alone
again
to
listen
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
to
wonder
what
was
going
to
happen
next
five
minutes
went
by
and
then
ten
but
still
he
did
not
return
when
he
did
so
it
was
with
a
still
more
serious
countenance
you
are
evidently
right
gentlemen
neither
the
spurious
marquis
nor
his
tutor
baxter
can
be
found
anywhere
i
have
discovered
too
that
all
their
valuables
and
light
luggage
have
been
smuggled
out
of
the
house
without
the
knowledge
of
my
servants
this
is
a
terrible
business
but
i
have
given
instructions
and
the
police
will
be
communicated
with
at
once
now
we
must
do
our
best
to
find
the
real
beckenham
lord
amberley
said
wetherell
in
a
choking
voice
do
you
think
one
of
your
servants
could
tell
my
daughter
to
come
to
me
at
once
i
am
not
feeling
very
well
the
governor
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
i
am
sorry
to
say
wetherell
your
daughter
left
the
house
an
hour
ago
a
message
was
brought
to
her
that
you
had
been
suddenly
taken
ill
and
needed
her
she
went
off
at
once
wetherell
anxiety
was
piteous
to
see
my
god
he
cried
in
despair
if
that
is
so
i
am
ruined
this
is
nikola
revenge
then
he
uttered
a
curious
little
sigh
moved
a
step
forward
and
fell
in
a
dead
faint
upon
the
floor
chapter
ii
on
the
trail
as
soon
as
wetherell
was
able
to
speak
again
he
said
as
feebly
as
an
old
man
of
ninety
take
me
home
hatteras
take
me
home
and
let
us
think
out
together
what
is
best
to
be
done
to
rescue
my
poor
child
the
governor
rose
to
his
feet
and
gave
him
his
arm
i
think
you
right
wetherell
he
said
it
is
of
course
just
probable
that
you
will
find
your
daughter
at
her
home
when
you
arrive
god
grant
she
may
be
but
in
case
she
is
not
i
will
communicate
all
i
know
to
the
police
commissioner
on
his
arrival
and
send
him
and
his
officers
on
to
you
we
must
lose
no
time
if
we
wish
to
catch
these
scoundrels
then
turning
to
me
he
continued
hatteras
it
is
owing
to
your
promptness
that
we
are
able
to
take
such
early
steps
i
shall
depend
upon
your
further
assistance
in
this
matter
you
may
do
so
with
perfect
confidence
i
answered
if
you
knew
all
you
would
understand
that
i
am
more
anxious
perhaps
than
any
one
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
young
lady
and
my
unfortunate
friend
next
moment
we
were
being
whirled
down
the
drive
at
a
pace
which
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
thought
dangerous
throughout
the
journey
we
sat
almost
silent
wrapped
in
our
anxieties
and
forebodings
hoping
almost
against
hope
that
when
we
arrived
at
potts
point
we
should
find
phyllis
awaiting
us
there
at
last
we
turned
into
the
grounds
and
on
reaching
the
house
i
sprang
out
and
rang
the
bell
then
i
went
down
to
help
my
companion
to
alight
the
butler
opened
the
door
and
descended
the
steps
to
take
the
rugs
wetherell
stopped
him
almost
angrily
crying
where
is
your
mistress
has
she
come
home
the
expression
of
surprise
on
the
man
face
told
me
before
he
had
time
to
utter
a
word
that
our
hopes
were
not
to
be
realized
miss
phyllis
sir
the
man
said
why
she
at
the
ball
wetherell
turned
from
him
with
a
deep
sigh
and
taking
my
arm
went
heavily
up
the
steps
into
the
hall
come
to
my
study
hatteras
he
said
and
let
me
confer
with
you
for
god
sake
do
desert
me
in
my
hour
of
need
you
need
have
no
fear
of
that
i
answered
if
it
is
bad
for
you
think
what
it
is
for
me
and
then
we
went
upstairs
together
reaching
his
study
wetherell
led
the
way
in
and
sat
down
i
went
across
to
the
hearthrug
and
stood
before
him
now
i
said
we
must
think
this
out
from
the
very
beginning
and
to
do
that
properly
we
must
consider
every
detail
have
you
any
objection
to
answering
my
questions
ask
any
questions
you
like
he
replied
and
i
will
answer
them
in
the
first
place
then
how
soon
after
his
arrival
in
the
colony
did
your
daughter
get
to
know
that
sham
beckenham
three
days
he
answered
at
a
dance
dinner
party
picnic
or
what
at
none
of
these
things
the
young
man
it
appears
had
seen
my
daughter
in
the
street
and
having
been
struck
with
her
beauty
asked
one
of
the
at
government
house
with
whom
we
are
on
intimate
terms
to
bring
him
to
call
at
the
time
i
remember
i
thought
it
a
particularly
friendly
action
on
his
part
i
do
doubt
it
i
answered
well
that
i
think
should
tell
us
one
thing
and
what
is
that
that
his
instructions
were
to
get
to
know
your
daughter
without
delay
but
what
could
his
reason
have
been
ah
that
i
can
not
tell
you
just
yet
now
you
must
pardon
what
i
am
going
to
say
do
you
think
he
was
serious
in
his
intentions
regarding
phyllis
i
mean
your
daughter
perfectly
as
far
as
i
could
tell
his
desire
he
said
was
if
she
would
have
him
to
be
allowed
to
marry
her
on
his
birthday
which
would
be
next
week
and
in
proof
of
permission
he
showed
me
a
cablegram
from
his
father
a
forgery
i
do
doubt
well
then
the
only
construction
i
can
put
upon
it
is
that
the
arrival
of
the
real
beckenham
in
sydney
must
have
frightened
him
thus
compelling
the
gang
to
resort
to
other
means
of
obtaining
possession
of
her
at
once
now
our
next
business
must
be
to
find
out
how
that
dastardly
act
was
accomplished
may
i
ring
the
bell
and
have
up
the
coachman
who
drove
your
daughter
to
the
ball
by
all
means
please
act
in
every
way
in
this
matter
as
if
this
house
were
your
own
i
rang
the
bell
and
when
the
butler
appeared
to
answer
it
wetherell
instructed
him
to
find
the
man
i
wanted
and
send
him
up
the
servant
left
the
room
again
and
for
five
minutes
we
awaited
his
reappearance
in
silence
when
he
did
come
back
he
said
thompson
has
not
come
home
yet
sir
not
come
home
yet
why
it
nearly
eleven
send
him
in
directly
he
arrives
hark
what
bell
is
that
front
door
sir
go
down
and
answer
it
then
and
if
it
should
be
the
commissioner
of
police
show
him
up
here
at
once
as
it
turned
out
it
was
not
the
commissioner
of
police
but
an
inspector
said
wetherell
you
have
come
from
government
house
i
presume
exactly
so
sir
replied
the
inspector
his
excellency
gave
us
some
particulars
and
then
sent
us
on
you
know
the
nature
of
the
case
his
excellency
informed
us
himself
and
what
steps
have
you
taken
well
sir
to
begin
with
we
have
given
orders
for
a
thorough
search
throughout
the
city
and
suburbs
for
the
tutor
and
the
sham
nobleman
at
the
same
time
more
men
are
out
looking
for
the
real
lord
beckenham
we
are
also
trying
to
find
your
coachman
who
was
supposed
to
have
driven
miss
wetherell
away
from
government
house
and
also
the
carriage
which
is
certain
to
be
found
before
very
long
he
had
hardly
finished
speaking
before
there
was
another
loud
ring
at
the
bell
and
presently
the
butler
entered
once
more
crossing
to
wetherell
he
said
two
policemen
are
at
the
front
door
and
they
have
brought
thompson
home
sir
ah
we
are
likely
to
have
a
little
light
thrown
upon
the
matter
now
let
them
bring
him
up
here
he
not
in
a
very
nice
state
sir
never
mind
that
bring
him
up
here
instantly
again
the
butler
departed
and
a
few
moments
later
heavy
footsteps
ascended
the
stairs
and
approached
the
study
door
then
two
stalwart
policemen
entered
the
room
supporting
between
them
a
miserable
figure
in
coachman
livery
his
hat
and
coat
were
gone
and
his
breeches
were
stained
with
mud
while
a
large
bruise
totally
obscured
his
left
eye
stand
him
over
there
opposite
me
said
wetherell
pointing
to
the
side
of
the
room
furthest
from
the
door
the
policemen
did
as
they
were
ordered
while
the
man
looked
more
dead
than
alive
now
thompson
said
wetherell
looking
sternly
at
him
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
but
the
man
only
groaned
seeing
that
in
his
present
state
he
could
say
nothing
i
went
across
to
the
table
and
mixed
him
a
glass
of
grog
when
i
gave
it
to
him
he
drank
it
eagerly
it
seemed
to
sharpen
his
wits
for
he
answered
instantly
it
was
my
fault
sir
if
i
only
ha
known
what
their
game
was
have
been
killed
afore
i
have
let
them
do
anything
to
hurt
the
young
lady
but
they
was
too
cunnin
for
me
sir
be
more
explicit
sir
said
wetherell
sternly
do
stand
there
whining
but
tell
your
story
and
at
once
the
poor
wretch
pulled
himself
together
and
did
his
best
it
was
in
this
way
sir
he
began
last
week
i
was
introduced
by
a
friend
of
mine
to
as
nice
a
spoken
man
as
ever
i
saw
he
was
from
england
he
said
and
having
a
little
money
thought
he
like
to
try
his
at
a
bit
racing
in
australia
like
he
was
on
the
for
a
smart
man
he
said
who
be
able
to
put
him
up
to
a
wrinkle
or
two
and
maybe
train
for
him
later
on
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
a
lot
about
me
and
thought
i
was
just
the
man
for
his
money
well
we
got
more
and
more
friendly
till
the
other
night
monday
when
he
said
as
how
he
settled
on
a
farm
a
bit
out
in
the
country
and
was
going
to
sign
the
agreement

called
it

stud

i
drove

according
to
orders
and
then
comin
went
round
by
the
to
give
my
answer

of
it
when
i
drove
up

was
standin
at

bein
an
affable
sort
of
fellow

like
to
leave
the
box
i
said
never
mind

horse

he
a
man
as
will
stand
by
it
for
five
minutes
he
gave
a
respectable
lookin
chap
alongside
the
a
sixpence
and
he
the
so
in
i
went
when
we
got
inside
i
was
for
goin
to
the
bar
but
says
this
is
an
important
business
matter
and
we
do
want
to
be
with
that
he
leads
the
way
into
a
private
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
shuts
the
door
yours
says
he
nobbler
o
rum

i
then
he
orders
a
nobbler
of
rum
for
me
and
a
nobbler
of
whisky
for
and
when
it
was
brought
we
sat
talkin
of
the
place
he
thought
o
takin
an
the
he
was
to
buy
an
then
says
somebody
listenin
at
the
door
i
a
step
jump
up
and
look
i
got
up
and
ran
to
the
door
but
there
was
nobody
there
so
i
sat
down
again
and
we
went
on
talking
then
he
says
takin
up
his
glass
to
your
thompson
and
success
to
the
farm
we
both
drank
it
an
went
on
talkin
till
i
felt
that
sleepy
i
did
know
what
to
do
then
i
dropped
off
an
after
that
i
do
remember
nothin
of
what
till
i
woke
up
in
the
domain
without
my
hat
and
coat
and
found
a
policeman
shakin
me
by
the
shoulder
the
whole
thing
is
as
plain
as
daylight
cried
wetherell
bitterly
it
is
a
thoroughly
organized
conspiracy
having
me
for
its
victim
oh
my
poor
little
girlie
what
has
my
obstinacy
brought
you
to
seeing
the
old
man
in
this
state
very
nearly
broke
me
down
but
i
mastered
myself
with
an
effort
and
addressed
a
question
to
the
unfortunate
coachman
pull
yourself
together
thompson
and
tell
me
as
correctly
as
you
can
what
this
friend
of
yours
was
like
i
fully
expected
to
hear
him
give
an
exact
description
of
the
man
who
had
followed
us
from
melbourne
but
i
was
mistaken
i
do
know
sir
said
thompson
as
i
could
rightly
tell
you
my
mind
being
still
a
bit
he
was
tall
but
not
by
any
manner
of
means
big
made
he
had
very
small
feet
a
sort
o
what
they
call
complexion
was
black
as
soot
an
so
was
eyes
an
they
sparkled
like
two
diamonds
do
you
remember
noticing
if
he
had
a
curious
gold
ring
on
his
little
finger
like
a
snake
he
had
sir
with
two
eyes
made
of
some
black
stone
that
just
as
true
as
you
born
then
it
was
nikola
i
cried
in
an
outburst
of
astonishment
and
he
followed
us
to
australia
after
all
wetherell
gave
a
deep
sigh
that
was
more
like
a
groan
than
anything
then
he
became
suddenly
a
new
man
mr
inspector
he
cried
to
the
police
officer
that
man
or
traces
of
him
must
be
found
before
daylight
i
know
him
and
he
is
as
slippery
as
an
eel
if
you
lose
a
minute
he
be
through
your
fingers
one
moment
first
i
cried
tell
me
this
thompson
when
you
drove
up
to
the
bird
where
did
you
say
this
man
was
standing
in
the
verandah
sir
had
he
his
hat
on
yes
sir
and
then
you
went
towards
the
bar
but
it
was
crowded
so
he
took
you
to
a
private
room
yes
sir
and
once
there
he
began
giving
you
the
details
of
this
farm
he
proposed
starting
did
he
work
out
any
figures
on
paper
yes
sir
on
what
on
a
letter
or
envelope
i
not
certain
which
which
of
course
he
took
from
his
pocket
yes
sir
very
good
i
said
then
turning
to
the
police
officer
now
mr
inspector
shall
we
be
off
to
the
if
you
wish
it
sir
in
the
meantime
i
send
instructions
back
by
these
men
to
the
different
stations
before
breakfast
time
we
must
have
the
man
who
held
the
horse
you
do
know
him
i
suppose
i
asked
thompson
no
sir
but
i
seen
him
before
he
answered
he
a
sydney
fellow
then
oh
yes
sir
then
there
should
be
no
difficulty
in
catching
him
now
let
us
be
going
wetherell
rose
to
accompany
us
but
hard
though
it
was
to
stop
him
i
eventually
succeeded
in
dissuading
him
from
such
a
course
but
you
will
let
me
know
directly
you
discover
anything
wo
you
mr
hatteras
he
cried
as
we
were
about
to
leave
the
room
think
of
my
anxiety
i
gave
my
promise
and
then
accompanied
by
the
inspector
left
the
house
hailing
a
passing
cab
we
jumped
into
it
and
told
the
driver
to
proceed
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
hotel
in
question
just
as
we
started
a
clock
in
the
neighbourhood
struck
twelve
phyllis
had
been
in
hands
three
hours
pulling
up
opposite
the
the
place
where
the
coachman
had
been
drugged
we
jumped
out
and
bade
the
cabman
wait
the
hotel
was
in
complete
darkness
and
it
was
not
until
we
had
pealed
the
bell
twice
that
we
succeeded
in
producing
any
sign
of
life
then
the
landlord
half
dressed
carrying
a
candle
in
his
hand
came
downstairs
and
called
out
to
know
who
was
there
and
what
we
wanted
my
companion
immediately
said
police
and
in
answer
to
that
magic
word
the
door
was
unbarred
bartrell
said
the
inspector
may
we
come
in
for
a
moment
on
business
certainly
mr
inspector
said
the
landlord
who
evidently
knew
my
companion
but
is
this
rather
late
for
a
call
i
hope
there
is
nothing
the
matter
nothing
much
returned
the
inspector
only
we
want
to
make
a
few
inquiries
about
a
man
who
was
here
and
for
whom
we
are
looking
if
that
is
so
i
afraid
i
must
call
my
barman
i
was
not
in
the
bar
this
evening
if
you
excuse
me
i
go
and
bring
him
down
in
the
meantime
make
yourselves
comfortable
he
left
us
to
kick
our
heels
in
the
hall
while
he
went
upstairs
again
in
about
ten
minutes
and
just
as
my
impatience
was
getting
the
better
of
me
he
returned
bringing
with
him
the
sleepy
barman
these
gentlemen
want
some
information
about
a
man
who
was
here
the
landlord
said
by
way
of
introduction
perhaps
you
can
give
it
what
was
he
like
sir
asked
the
barman
of
the
inspector
the
latter
however
turned
to
me
tall
slim
with
a
sallow
complexion
i
said
black
hair
and
very
dark
restless
eyes
he
came
in
here
with
the
hon
sylvester
coachman
the
man
seemed
to
recollect
him
at
once
i
remember
him
he
said
they
sat
in
no
down
the
passage
there
and
the
man
you
mention
ordered
a
nobbler
of
rum
and
a
whisky
that
the
fellow
we
want
said
the
inspector
now
tell
me
this
have
you
ever
seen
him
in
here
before
never
once
said
the
barman
and
that
a
solemn
fact
because
if
i
had
i
could
have
forgotten
it
his
would
let
you
do
that
no
sir
was
the
first
night
he
ever
been
in
the
did
any
one
else
visit
them
while
they
were
in
the
room
together
not
as
i
know
of
but
stay
i
not
so
certain
yes
i
remember
seeing
a
tall
chap
come
down
the
passage
and
go
in
there
but
it
was
some
time
half
an
hour
maybe
after
i
took
in
the
drinks
did
you
see
him
come
out
again
no
but
i
know
the
coachman
got
very
drunk
and
had
to
be
carried
out
to
the
carriage
how
do
you
know
that
because
i
saw
the
other
two
doing
it
the
inspector
turned
to
me
not
very
satisfactory
is
it
no
i
answered
but
do
you
mind
letting
us
look
into
no
the
room
they
occupied
not
at
all
said
the
landlord
come
with
me
so
saying
he
led
the
way
down
the
passage
to
a
little
room
on
the
side
the
door
of
which
he
threw
open
with
a
theatrical
flourish
it
was
in
pitch
darkness
but
a
few
seconds
later
the
gas
was
lit
and
we
could
see
all
that
it
contained
a
small
table
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
round
the
walls
were
ranged
two
or
three
wooden
chairs
a
small
window
was
at
the
further
end
and
a
fireplace
opposite
the
door
on
the
table
was
a
cigar
and
a
torn
copy
of
the
but
that
was
not
what
i
wanted
so
i
went
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
looked
about
upon
the
floor
presently
i
descried
a
small
ball
of
paper
near
the
grate
picking
it
up
i
seated
myself
at
the
table
and
turned
to
the
barman
who
was
watching
my
movements
attentively
was
this
room
used
by
any
other
people
after
the
party
we
are
looking
for
left
no
sir
there
was
nobody
in
either
of
these
two
bottom
rooms
you
are
quite
certain
of
that
perfectly
certain
i
took
up
the
ball
of
paper
unrolled
it
and
spread
it
out
upon
the
table
to
my
disgust
it
was
only
the
back
half
of
an
envelope
and
though
it
had
a
few
figures
dotted
about
upon
it
was
of
no
possible
use
to
us
nothing
there
asked
the
inspector
nothing
at
all
i
answered
bitterly
save
a
few
incomprehensible
figures
well
in
that
case
we
better
be
getting
up
to
the
station
and
see
if
they
discovered
anything
yet
come
along
then
i
answered
we
must
be
quick
though
for
we
lost
a
lot
of
precious
time
and
every
minute
counts
i
took
up
the
and
followed
him
out
to
the
cab
after
having
sincerely
thanked
the
hotel
proprietor
and
the
barman
for
their
courtesy
the
inspector
gave
the
driver
his
orders
and
we
set
off
as
we
went
we
discussed
our
next
movements
and
while
we
were
doing
so
i
idly
glanced
at
the
paper
i
held
in
my
hand
there
was
a
lamp
in
the
cab
and
the
light
showed
me
on
the
bottom
corner
a
round
blue
stamp
mark
maxwell
stationer
and
newsagent
ipswell
street
woolahra
stop
the
cab
i
almost
shouted
tell
the
man
to
drive
us
back
to
the
quickly
the
order
was
given
the
cab
faced
round
and
in
less
than
a
minute
we
were
on
our
way
back
what
up
now
asked
the
astonished
inspector
only
that
i
believe
i
got
a
clue
i
cried
i
did
not
explain
any
further
and
in
five
minutes
we
had
brought
the
landlord
downstairs
again
i
sorry
to
trouble
you
in
this
fashion
i
cried
but
life
and
death
depend
on
it
i
want
you
to
let
me
see
no
again
he
conducted
us
to
the
room
and
once
more
the
gas
was
lit
the
small
strip
of
envelope
lay
upon
the
table
just
as
i
had
thrown
it
down
i
seated
myself
and
again
looked
closely
at
it
then
i
sprang
to
my
feet
i
thought
so
i
cried
excitedly
pointing
to
the
paper
i
told
you
i
had
a
clue
now
mr
inspector
who
wrote
those
figures
the
man
you
call
nikola
i
suppose
that
right
now
who
would
have
bought
this
newspaper
you
must
remember
that
thompson
only
left
his
box
to
come
in
here
nikola
i
suppose
very
good
then
according
to
your
own
showing
nikola
owned
this
piece
of
envelope
and
this
if
that
is
certain
look
here
he
came
round
and
looked
over
my
shoulder
i
pointed
to
what
was
evidently
part
of
the
gummed
edge
of
the
top
of
the
envelope
on
it
were
these
three
important
words
swell
street
woolahra
well
he
said
what
about
it
why
look
here
i
said
as
i
opened
the
and
pointed
to
the
at
the
bottom
the
man
who
bought
this
newspaper
at
maxwell
shop
also
bought
this
envelope
there
the
letters
before
constitute
the
last
half
of
ipswell
the
name
of
the
street
if
that
man
be
nikola
as
we
suspect
the
person
who
served
him
is
certain
to
remember
him
and
it
is
just
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
he
may
know
his
address
that
so
said
the
inspector
struck
with
the
force
of
my
argument
i
know
maxwell
shop
and
our
best
plan
will
be
to
go
on
there
as
fast
as
we
can
again
thanking
the
landlord
for
his
civility
we
returned
to
our
cab
and
once
more
set
off
this
time
for
maxwell
shop
in
ipswell
street
by
the
time
we
reached
it
it
was
nearly
three
and
gradually
growing
light
as
the
cab
drew
up
alongside
the
curb
the
inspector
jumped
out
and
rang
the
bell
at
the
side
door
it
was
opened
after
awhile
by
a
youth
who
stared
at
us
in
sleepy
astonishment
does
maxwell
live
at
the
shop
asked
the
inspector
no
sir
where
then
ponson
street
third
house
on
the
side
thank
you
once
more
we
jumped
into
the
cab
and
rattled
off
it
seemed
to
me
so
anxious
and
terrified
was
i
for
my
darling
safety
that
we
were
fated
never
to
get
the
information
we
wanted
the
whole
thing
was
like
some
nightmare
in
which
try
how
i
would
to
move
every
step
was
clogged
a
few
minutes
drive
brought
us
to
ponson
street
and
we
drew
up
at
the
third
house
on
the
side
it
was
a
pretty
little
villa
with
a
nice
front
garden
and
a
verandah
we
rang
the
bell
and
waited
presently
we
heard
some
one
coming
down
the
passage
and
a
moment
later
the
door
was
unlocked
who
is
there
cried
a
voice
from
within
police
said
my
companion
as
before
the
door
was
immediately
opened
and
a
very
small
man
dressed
in
a
flaring
suit
of
striped
pyjamas
stood
before
us
is
anything
wrong
gentlemen
he
asked
nervously
nothing
to
affect
you
maxwell
my
companion
replied
we
only
want
a
little
important
information
if
you
can
give
it
us
we
are
anxious
to
discover
a
man
whereabouts
before
daylight
and
we
have
been
led
to
believe
that
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
give
us
the
necessary
clue
good
gracious
but
i
shall
be
happy
to
serve
you
if
i
can
the
little
man
answered
leading
the
way
into
his
with
an
air
of
importance
his
appearance
rather
belied
what
is
it
well
it
this
i
replied
producing
the
piece
of
envelope
and
the
you
see
these
letters
on
the
top
of
this
paper
do
you
he
nodded
his
attention
at
once
secured
by
seeing
his
own
name
well
that
envelope
was
evidently
purchased
in
your
shop
so
was
this
newspaper
how
can
you
tell
that
in
the
case
of
the
envelope
by
these
letters
in
that
of
the
paper
by
your
rubber
stamp
on
the
bottom
ah
well
now
and
in
what
way
can
i
help
you
we
want
to
know
the
address
of
the
man
who
bought
them
that
will
surely
be
difficult
can
you
give
me
any
idea
of
what
he
was
like
tall
slightly
foreign
in
appearance
distinctly
handsome
sallow
complexion
very
dark
eyes
black
hair
small
hands
and
feet
as
my
description
progressed
the
little
man
face
brightened
then
he
cried
with
evident
triumph
i
know
the
man
he
came
into
the
shop
yesterday
afternoon
and
his
address
is
his
face
fell
again
his
information
was
not
quite
as
helpful
as
he
had
expected
it
would
be
there
i
ca
help
you
i
sorry
to
say
he
bought
a
packet
of
paper
and
envelopes
and
the
and
then
left
the
shop
i
was
so
struck
by
his
appearance
that
i
went
to
the
door
and
watched
him
cross
the
road
and
in
which
direction
did
he
go
over
to
podgers
chemist
shop
across
the
way
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
i
obliged
to
you
maxwell
i
said
shaking
him
by
the
hand
but
i
sorry
you
ca
tell
us
something
more
definite
about
him
then
turning
to
the
inspector
i
suppose
we
had
better
go
off
and
find
podgers
but
if
we
have
to
spend
much
more
time
in
rushing
about
like
this
we
shall
be
certain
to
lose
them
altogether
let
us
be
off
to
podgers
then
as
fast
as
we
can
go
bidding
maxwell
we
set
off
again
and
in
ten
minutes
had
arrived
at
the
shop
and
had
podgers
downstairs
we
explained
our
errand
briefly
and
gave
a
minute
description
of
the
man
we
wanted
i
remember
him
perfectly
said
the
sedate
podgers
he
came
into
my
shop
last
night
and
purchased
a
bottle
of
chloroform
you
made
him
sign
the
poison
book
of
course
naturally
i
did
mr
inspector
would
you
like
to
see
his
signature
very
much
we
both
answered
at
once
and
the
book
was
accordingly
produced
podgers
ran
his
finger
down
the
list
brown
williams
davis
ah
here
it
is
venneage
calliope
street
woolahra
venneage
i
cried
why
that
not
his
name
very
likely
not
replied
podgers
but
it
the
name
he
gave
me
never
mind
we
try
calliope
street
on
the
chance
said
the
inspector
again
we
drove
off
this
time
at
increased
pace
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
we
had
turned
into
the
street
we
wanted
and
pulled
up
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
junction
it
was
a
small
thoroughfare
with
a
long
line
of
villa
residences
on
either
side
a
policeman
was
sauntering
along
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
and
the
inspector
called
him
over
he
saluted
respectfully
and
waited
to
be
addressed
what
do
you
know
of
number
asked
the
inspector
briefly
the
constable
considered
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
sir
i
did
know
until
yesterday
that
it
was
occupied
have
you
seen
anybody
about
there
i
saw
three
men
go
in
just
as
i
came
on
the
beat
what
were
they
like
well
i
do
know
that
i
looked
much
at
them
they
were
all
pretty
big
and
they
seemed
to
be
laughing
and
enjoying
themselves
did
they
well
we
must
go
in
there
and
have
a
look
at
them
you
had
better
come
with
us
we
walked
on
down
the
street
till
we
arrived
at
no
then
opening
the
gate
we
went
up
the
steps
to
the
hall
door
it
was
quite
light
enough
by
this
time
to
enable
us
to
see
everything
distinctly
the
inspector
gave
the
bell
a
good
pull
and
the
peal
inside
the
house
but
not
a
sound
of
any
living
being
came
from
within
in
answer
again
the
bell
was
pulled
and
once
more
we
waited
patiently
but
with
the
same
result
either
there
nobody
at
home
or
they
refuse
to
hear
said
the
inspector
constable
you
remain
where
you
are
and
collar
the
first
man
you
see
hatteras
we
will
go
round
to
the
back
and
try
to
effect
an
entrance
from
there
we
left
the
front
door
and
finding
a
path
reached
the
yard
the
house
was
only
a
small
one
with
a
little
verandah
at
the
rear
on
to
which
the
back
door
opened
on
either
side
of
the
door
were
two
windows
and
by
some
good
fortune
it
chanced
that
the
catch
of
one
of
these
was
broken
lifting
the
sash
up
the
inspector
jumped
into
the
room
and
as
soon
as
he
was
through
i
followed
him
then
we
looked
about
us
the
room
however
was
destitute
of
furniture
or
occupants
i
do
hear
anybody
about
my
companion
said
opening
the
door
that
led
into
the
hall
just
at
that
moment
i
heard
a
sound
and
touching
his
arm
signed
to
him
to
listen
we
both
did
so
and
surely
enough
there
came
again
the
faint
muttering
of
a
human
voice
in
the
of
the
hall
it
sounded
most
uncanny
somebody
in
one
of
the
front
rooms
said
the
inspector
i
slip
along
and
open
the
front
door
bring
in
the
man
from
outside
and
then
we
burst
into
the
room
and
take
our
chance
of
capturing
them
he
did
as
he
proposed
and
when
the
constable
had
joined
us
we
moved
towards
the
room
on
the
left
again
the
mutterings
came
from
the
inside
and
the
inspector
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
it
was
locked
however
let
me
burst
it
in
i
whispered
he
nodded
and
i
accordingly
put
my
shoulder
against
it
and
bringing
my
strength
to
bear
sent
it
flying
in
then
we
rushed
into
the
room
to
find
it
at
first
glance
empty
just
at
that
moment
however
the
muttering
began
again
and
we
looked
towards
the
darkest
corner
somebody
was
there
lying
on
the
ground
i
rushed
across
and
knelt
down
to
look
was
beckenham
his
mouth
gagged
and
his
hands
and
feet
bound
the
noise
we
had
heard
was
that
made
by
him
trying
to
call
us
to
his
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
i
had
cut
his
bonds
and
helped
him
to
sit
up
then
i
explained
to
the
inspector
who
he
was
thank
god
you
found
i
cried
but
what
does
it
all
mean
how
long
have
you
been
like
this
and
where
is
nikola
i
do
know
how
long
i
been
here
he
answered
and
i
do
know
where
nikola
is
but
you
must
know
something
about
him
i
cried
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
all
you
can
i
in
awful
trouble
and
your
story
may
give
me
the
means
of
saving
a
life
that
is
dearer
to
me
than
my
own
get
me
something
to
drink
first
then
he
replied
i
nearly
dying
of
thirst
after
that
i
tell
you
fortunately
i
had
had
the
foresight
to
put
a
flask
of
whisky
into
my
pocket
and
i
now
took
it
out
and
gave
him
a
stiff
nobbler
it
revived
him
somewhat
and
he
prepared
to
begin
his
tale
but
the
inspector
interrupted
before
you
commence
my
lord
i
must
send
word
to
the
commissioner
that
you
have
been
found
he
wrote
a
message
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
despatched
the
constable
with
it
having
done
so
he
turned
to
beckenham
and
said
now
my
lord
pray
let
us
hear
your
story
beckenham
forthwith
commenced
chapter
iii
lord
beckenham
story
when
you
left
me
hatteras
i
remained
in
the
house
for
half
an
hour
or
so
reading
then
thinking
no
harm
could
possibly
come
of
it
i
started
out
for
a
little
excursion
on
my
own
account
it
was
about
eleven
then
leaving
the
hotel
i
made
for
the
ferry
and
crossed
darling
harbour
to
millers
point
then
setting
myself
for
a
good
ramble
off
i
went
through
the
city
up
one
street
and
down
another
to
eventually
bring
up
in
the
botanical
gardens
the
view
was
so
exquisite
that
i
sat
myself
down
on
a
seat
and
resigned
myself
to
rapturous
contemplation
of
it
how
long
i
remained
there
i
could
not
possibly
say
i
only
know
that
while
i
was
watching
the
movements
of
a
in
the
cove
below
me
i
became
aware
by
intuition
for
i
did
not
look
at
him
that
i
was
the
object
of
close
scrutiny
by
a
man
standing
some
little
distance
from
me
presently
i
found
him
drawing
closer
to
me
until
he
came
boldly
up
and
seated
himself
beside
me
he
was
a
little
chap
in
some
ways
not
unlike
my
old
tutor
baxter
with
a
shrewd
face
grey
hair
bushy
eyebrows
and
a
long
and
rather
hooked
nose
he
was
well
dressed
and
when
we
had
been
sitting
side
by
side
for
some
minutes
he
turned
to
me
and
said
is
a
beautiful
picture
we
have
spread
before
us
is
it
not
is
indeed
i
answered
what
a
diversity
of
shipping
may
well
say
that
he
continued
would
be
an
interesting
study
would
it
not
to
make
a
list
of
all
the
craft
that
pass
in
and
out
of
this
harbour
in
a
day
to
put
down
the
places
where
they
were
built
and
whence
they
hail
the
characters
of
their
owners
and
commanders
and
their
errands
about
the
world
what
a
book
it
would
make
would
it
not
look
at
that
in
farm
cove
think
of
the
money
she
cost
think
of
where
that
money
came
from
the
rich
people
who
paid
without
thinking
the
poor
who
dreaded
the
coming
of
the
tax
collector
like
a
visit
from
the
evil
one
imagine
the
busy
dockyard
in
which
she
was
built
ca
you
seem
to
hear
the
clang
of
the
riveters
and
the
buzzing
of
the
steam
saws
then
take
that
norwegian
boat
passing
the
fort
there
think
of
her
birthplace
in
far
norway
think
of
the
places
she
has
since
seen
imagine
her
masts
growing
in
the
forests
on
the
mountain
side
of
lonely
fiords
where
the
silence
is
so
intense
that
a
stone
rolling
down
and
dropping
into
the
water
echoes
like
thunder
he
went
on
like
this
for
some
time
until
i
said
seem
to
have
studied
it
very
carefully
i
have
he
answered
am
deeply
interested
in
the
life
of
the
sea
few
more
so
are
you
a
stranger
in
new
south
wales
a
stranger
i
replied
only
arrived
in
australia
a
few
days
since
then
you
have
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
many
entrancing
beauties
yet
forgive
my
impertinence
but
if
you
are
on
a
tour
let
me
recommend
you
to
see
the
islands
before
you
return
home
islands
i
presume
you
mean
i
said
the
bewitching
islands
of
the
southern
seas
the
most
entrancingly
beautiful
spots
on
god
beautiful
earth
see
them
before
you
go
they
will
amply
repay
any
trouble
it
may
cost
you
to
reach
them
should
like
to
see
them
very
much
i
answered
you
are
interested
in
them
already
he
continued
much
indeed
i
replied
in
that
case
i
may
not
be
considered
presumptuous
if
i
offer
to
assist
you
i
am
an
old
merchant
myself
and
i
have
amassed
a
large
collection
of
beautiful
objects
from
the
islands
if
you
would
allow
me
the
pleasure
i
should
be
delighted
to
show
them
to
you
should
like
to
see
them
very
much
indeed
i
answered
thinking
it
extremely
civil
of
him
you
have
time
we
might
perhaps
go
and
them
now
my
house
is
but
a
short
distance
from
the
domain
and
my
carriage
is
waiting
at
the
gates
shall
be
delighted
i
said
thinking
there
could
be
no
possible
harm
in
my
accepting
his
invitation
before
we
go
may
i
be
allowed
to
introduce
myself
the
old
gentleman
said
taking
a
from
his
pocket
and
withdrawing
a
card
this
he
handed
to
me
and
on
it
i
read
mathew
draper
am
afraid
i
have
no
card
to
offer
you
in
return
i
said
i
am
the
marquis
of
beckenham
then
i
am
doubly
honoured
the
old
gentleman
said
with
a
low
bow
shall
we
wend
our
way
up
towards
my
carriage
we
did
so
chatting
as
we
went
at
the
gates
a
neat
brougham
was
waiting
for
us
and
in
it
we
took
our
places
cried
my
host
and
forthwith
we
set
off
down
the
street
up
one
thoroughfare
and
down
another
we
passed
until
i
lost
all
count
of
our
direction
throughout
the
drive
my
companion
talked
away
in
his
best
style
commented
on
the
architecture
of
the
houses
had
many
queer
stories
to
tell
of
the
and
in
many
other
ways
kept
my
attention
engaged
till
the
carriage
came
to
a
standstill
before
a
small
but
pretty
villa
in
a
quiet
street
draper
immediately
alighted
and
when
i
had
done
so
dismissed
his
coachman
who
drove
away
as
we
passed
through
the
little
garden
and
approached
the
dwelling
the
front
door
was
opened
by
a
dignified
and
we
entered
the
hall
which
was
a
spacious
one
for
so
small
a
dwelling
was
filled
with
curios
and
weapons
but
i
had
small
time
for
observing
them
as
my
host
led
me
towards
a
room
at
the
back
as
we
entered
it
he
said
make
you
welcome
to
my
house
my
lord
i
hope
now
that
you
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
i
shall
be
able
to
show
you
something
that
will
repay
your
visit
thereupon
bidding
me
seat
myself
for
a
few
moments
he
excused
himself
and
left
the
room
when
he
returned
he
began
to
do
the
honours
of
the
apartment
first
we
examined
a
rack
of
australian
spears
and
boomerangs
then
another
containing
new
zealand
hatchets
and
clubs
after
this
we
crossed
to
a
sort
of
alcove
where
reposed
in
cases
a
great
number
of
curios
collected
from
the
further
islands
of
the
pacific
i
was
about
to
take
up
one
of
these
when
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
opened
and
some
one
entered
at
first
i
did
not
look
round
but
hearing
the
approaching
me
i
turned
to
find
myself
to
my
horrified
surprise
face
to
face
he
was
dressed
entirely
in
black
his
coat
was
buttoned
and
displayed
all
the
symmetry
of
his
peculiar
figure
while
his
hair
seemed
blacker
and
his
complexion
even
paler
than
before
he
had
evidently
been
prepared
for
my
visit
for
he
held
out
his
hand
and
greeted
me
without
a
sign
of
astonishment
upon
his
face
is
indeed
a
pleasure
my
lord
he
said
still
with
his
hand
looking
hard
at
me
with
his
peculiar
eyes
did
not
expect
to
see
you
again
so
soon
and
you
are
evidently
a
little
surprised
at
meeting
me
am
more
than
surprised
i
answered
bitterly
am
horribly
mortified
and
angry
draper
said
nothing
but
nikola
dropped
into
a
chair
and
spoke
for
him
must
not
blame
my
old
friend
draper
he
said
suavely
have
been
wondering
for
the
last
hours
how
we
might
best
get
hold
of
you
and
the
means
we
have
employed
so
successfully
seemed
the
only
possible
way
have
no
fear
my
lord
you
shall
not
be
hurt
in
less
than
hours
you
will
enjoy
the
society
of
your
energetic
friend
hatteras
again
is
your
reason
for
abducting
me
like
this
i
asked
are
foolish
to
do
so
for
hatteras
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
find
me
do
not
doubt
that
at
all
said
nikola
quietly
i
think
hatteras
will
find
he
will
have
all
his
work
cut
out
for
him
this
time
you
imagine
that
your
plans
are
not
known
in
sydney
you
are
mistaken
i
cried
farce
you
are
playing
at
government
house
is
detected
and
hatteras
directly
he
finds
i
am
lost
will
go
to
lord
amberley
and
reveal
everything
have
not
the
slightest
objection
returned
nikola
quietly
the
time
hatteras
can
take
those
steps
indeed
by
the
time
he
discovers
your
absence
at
all
we
shall
be
beyond
his
reach
i
could
not
follow
his
meaning
of
course
but
while
he
had
been
speaking
i
had
been
looking
stealthily
round
me
for
a
means
of
escape
the
only
way
out
of
the
room
was
of
course
by
the
door
but
both
nikola
and
his
ally
were
between
me
and
that
then
a
big
stone
hatchet
hanging
on
the
wall
near
me
caught
my
eye
hardly
had
i
seen
it
before
an
idea
flashed
through
my
brain
supposing
i
seized
it
and
fought
my
way
out
the
door
of
the
room
stood
open
and
i
noticed
with
delight
that
the
key
was
in
the
lock
on
the
outside
one
rush
armed
with
the
big
hatchet
would
take
me
into
the
passage
then
before
my
foes
could
recover
their
wits
i
might
be
able
to
turn
the
key
and
having
locked
them
in
make
my
escape
from
the
house
without
another
thought
i
made
up
my
mind
sprang
to
the
wall
wrenched
down
the
hatchet
and
prepared
for
my
rush
but
by
the
time
i
had
done
it
both
nikola
and
draper
were
on
their
feet
of
my
way
i
cried
raising
my
awful
weapon
aloft
me
at
your
peril
with
my
hatchet
in
the
air
i
looked
at
nikola
he
was
standing
rigidly
erect
with
one
arm
the
hand
pointing
at
me
his
eyes
glared
like
living
coals
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
came
from
between
his
teeth
like
a
serpent
hiss
down
that
axe
he
said
with
that
the
old
horrible
fear
of
him
which
had
seized
me
on
board
ship
came
over
me
again
his
eyes
fascinated
me
so
that
i
could
not
look
away
from
them
i
put
down
the
hatchet
without
another
thought
still
he
gazed
at
me
in
the
same
hideous
fashion
down
in
that
chair
he
said
quietly
can
not
disobey
me
and
indeed
i
could
not
my
heart
was
throbbing
painfully
and
an
awful
dizziness
was
creeping
over
me
still
i
could
not
get
away
from
those
terrible
eyes
they
seemed
to
be
growing
larger
and
fiercer
every
moment
oh
i
can
feel
the
horror
of
them
even
now
as
i
gazed
his
white
right
hand
was
moving
to
and
fro
before
me
with
regular
sweeps
and
with
each
one
i
felt
my
own
will
growing
weaker
and
weaker
that
i
was
being
mesmerized
i
had
no
doubt
but
if
i
had
been
going
to
be
murdered
i
could
not
have
moved
a
finger
to
save
myself
then
there
came
a
sudden
but
imperative
knock
at
the
door
and
both
nikola
and
draper
rose
next
moment
the
man
whom
we
had
noticed
in
the
train
as
we
came
up
from
melbourne
and
against
whom
you
hatteras
had
warned
me
in
sydney
entered
the
room
he
crossed
and
stood
respectfully
before
nikola
eastover
what
news
asked
the
latter
you
done
what
i
told
you
the
man
answered
taking
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
is
the
letter
you
wanted
nikola
took
it
from
his
subordinate
hand
broke
the
seal
and
having
withdrawn
the
contents
read
it
carefully
all
this
time
seeing
resistance
was
quite
useless
i
did
not
move
i
felt
too
sick
and
giddy
for
anything
when
he
had
finished
his
correspondence
nikola
said
something
in
an
undertone
to
draper
who
immediately
left
the
room
during
the
time
he
was
absent
none
of
us
spoke
presently
he
returned
bringing
with
him
a
wine
glass
filled
with
water
which
he
presented
to
nikola
you
said
that
gentleman
feeling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
presently
he
found
what
he
wanted
and
produced
what
looked
like
a
small
silver
unscrewing
the
top
he
poured
from
it
into
the
wine
glass
a
few
drops
of
some
liquid
having
done
this
he
smelt
it
carefully
and
then
handed
it
to
me
must
ask
you
to
drink
this
my
lord
he
said
need
have
no
fear
of
the
result
it
is
perfectly
harmless
did
ever
man
hear
such
a
cool
proposition
very
naturally
i
declined
to
do
as
he
wished
drink
it
he
reiterated
do
so
at
once
i
have
no
time
to
waste
bandying
words
will
not
drink
it
i
cried
rising
to
my
feet
and
prepared
to
make
a
fight
for
it
if
need
should
be
once
more
those
eyes
grew
terrible
and
once
more
that
hand
began
to
make
the
passes
before
my
face
again
i
felt
the
dizziness
stealing
over
me
his
will
was
growing
every
moment
too
strong
for
me
i
could
not
resist
him
so
when
he
once
more
said
i
took
the
glass
and
did
as
i
was
ordered
after
that
i
remember
seeing
nikola
draper
and
the
man
they
called
eastover
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
i
remember
nikola
crossing
to
where
i
sat
and
gazing
steadfastly
into
my
face
and
after
that
i
recollect
no
more
until
i
came
to
my
senses
in
this
room
to
find
myself
bound
and
gagged
for
what
seemed
like
hours
i
lay
in
agony
then
i
heard
footsteps
in
the
verandah
and
next
moment
the
sound
of
voices
i
tried
to
call
for
help
but
could
utter
no
words
i
thought
you
would
go
away
without
discovering
me
but
fortunately
for
me
you
did
not
do
so
now
hatteras
i
have
told
you
everything
for
some
time
after
the
marquis
had
concluded
his
strange
story
both
the
inspector
and
i
sat
in
deep
thought
that
beckenham
had
been
kidnapped
in
order
that
he
should
be
out
of
the
way
while
the
villainous
plot
for
abducting
phyllis
was
being
enacted
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
why
had
he
been
chosen
and
what
clues
were
we
to
gather
from
what
he
had
told
us
i
turned
to
the
inspector
and
said
what
do
you
think
will
be
the
best
course
for
us
to
pursue
now
i
have
been
wondering
myself
i
think
as
there
is
nothing
to
be
learned
from
this
house
the
better
plan
would
be
for
you
two
gentlemen
to
go
back
to
wetherell
while
i
return
to
the
detective
office
and
see
if
anything
has
been
discovered
by
the
men
there
as
soon
as
i
have
found
out
i
will
join
you
at
potts
point
what
do
you
think
i
agreed
that
it
would
be
the
best
course
so
taking
the
marquis
by
the
arms
for
he
was
still
too
weak
to
walk
alone
we
left
the
house
and
were
about
to
step
into
the
street
when
i
stopped
and
asking
them
to
wait
for
me
ran
back
into
the
room
again
in
the
corner
just
as
it
had
been
thrown
down
lay
the
rope
with
which
beckenham
had
been
bound
and
the
pad
which
had
been
fitted
over
his
mouth
i
picked
both
up
and
carried
them
into
the
verandah
come
here
mr
inspector
i
cried
i
thought
i
should
learn
something
from
this
look
at
this
rope
and
this
pad
and
tell
me
what
you
make
of
them
he
took
each
up
in
turn
and
looked
them
over
and
over
but
he
only
shook
his
head
i
do
see
anything
to
guide
us
he
said
do
you
i
cried
why
they
tell
me
more
than
i
have
learnt
from
anything
else
i
seen
look
at
the
two
ends
of
this
they
seized
i
looked
triumphantly
at
him
but
he
only
stared
at
me
in
surprise
and
said
what
do
you
mean
by
why
i
mean
that
the
ends
are
bound
up
in
this
way
look
for
yourself
now
not
one
landsman
in
a
hundred
a
rope
end
this
line
was
taken
from
some
ship
in
the
harbour
and
by
jove
here
another
discovery
what
now
he
cried
being
by
this
time
almost
as
excited
as
i
was
myself
why
look
here
i
said
holding
the
middle
of
the
rope
up
to
the
light
so
that
we
could
get
a
better
view
of
it
not
very
many
hours
ago
this
rope
was
running
through
a
block
and
that
block
was
an
uncommon
one
how
do
you
know
that
it
was
an
uncommon
one
because
it
has
been
newly
painted
and
what
funnier
still
painted
green
of
all
other
colours
look
at
this
streak
of
paint
along
the
line
see
how
it
smudged
now
let
review
the
case
as
we
walk
along
so
saying
with
the
marquis
between
us
we
set
off
down
the
street
hoping
to
be
able
to
pick
up
a
cab
first
and
foremost
i
said
remember
old
draper
talk
of
the
south
seas
remember
the
collection
of
curios
he
possessed
probably
he
owns
a
schooner
and
it
more
than
probable
that
this
line
and
this
bit
of
canvas
came
from
it
i
see
what
you
driving
at
said
the
inspector
it
worth
considering
directly
i
get
to
the
office
i
will
set
men
to
work
to
try
and
find
this
mysterious
gentleman
you
would
know
him
again
my
lord
i
should
know
him
anywhere
was
beckenham
immediate
reply
and
have
you
any
idea
at
all
where
this
house
to
which
he
conducted
you
is
located
none
at
all
i
only
know
that
it
was
about
down
a
street
of
which
all
the
houses
save
the
one
at
the
corner
which
was
a
shop
were
villas
nothing
a
little
more
definite
i
suppose
stay
i
remember
that
there
was
an
empty
house
with
broken
windows
almost
opposite
and
that
on
either
side
of
the
steps
leading
up
to
the
front
door
were
two
stone
eagles
with
wings
the
head
of
one
of
the
eagles
the
left
i
think
was
missing
the
inspector
noted
these
things
in
his
and
just
as
he
had
finished
we
picked
up
a
cab
and
called
it
to
the
side
walk
when
we
had
got
in
and
given
the
driver
wetherell
address
i
said
to
the
inspector
what
are
you
going
to
do
first
put
some
men
on
to
find
draper
and
some
more
to
find
a
schooner
with
her
blocks
newly
painted
green
you
wo
be
long
in
letting
us
know
what
you
discover
i
said
remember
how
anxious
we
are
you
may
count
on
my
coming
to
you
at
once
with
any
news
i
may
procure
he
answered
a
few
moments
later
we
drew
up
at
wetherell
door
bidding
the
inspector
we
went
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
by
the
time
the
cab
was
out
in
the
street
again
we
were
in
the
house
making
our
way
behind
the
butler
to
wetherell
study
the
old
gentleman
had
not
gone
to
bed
but
sat
just
as
i
had
left
him
so
many
hours
before
as
soon
as
we
were
announced
he
rose
to
receive
us
thank
god
hatteras
you
have
come
back
he
said
i
have
been
in
a
perfect
fever
waiting
for
you
what
have
you
to
report
not
very
much
i
afraid
i
answered
but
first
let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
the
real
marquis
of
beckenham
to
you
whom
we
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
and
rescue
wetherell
bowed
gravely
and
held
out
his
hand
my
lord
he
said
i
am
thankful
that
you
have
been
discovered
i
look
upon
it
as
one
step
towards
the
recovery
of
my
poor
girl
i
hope
now
that
both
you
and
hatteras
will
take
up
your
abode
with
me
during
the
remainder
of
your
stay
in
the
colony
you
have
had
a
scurvy
welcome
to
new
south
wales
we
must
see
if
we
ca
make
up
to
you
for
it
but
you
look
thoroughly
worn
out
i
expect
you
would
like
to
go
to
bed
he
rang
the
bell
and
when
his
butler
appeared
gave
him
some
instructions
about
preparing
rooms
for
us
ten
minutes
later
the
man
returned
and
stated
that
our
rooms
were
ready
whereupon
wetherell
himself
conducted
beckenham
to
the
apartment
assigned
to
him
when
he
returned
to
me
he
asked
if
i
would
not
like
to
retire
too
but
i
would
not
hear
of
it
i
could
not
have
slept
a
wink
so
great
was
my
anxiety
seeing
this
he
seated
himself
and
listened
attentively
while
i
gave
him
an
outline
of
beckenham
story
i
had
hardly
finished
before
i
heard
a
carriage
roll
up
to
the
door
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
presently
the
butler
who
like
ourselves
had
not
dreamt
of
going
to
bed
though
his
master
had
repeatedly
urged
him
to
do
so
entered
and
announced
the
inspector
wetherell
hobbled
across
to
receive
him
with
an
anxious
face
have
you
any
better
tidings
for
me
he
asked
not
very
much
i
afraid
sir
the
inspector
said
shaking
his
head
the
best
i
have
to
tell
you
is
that
your
carriage
and
horse
have
been
found
in
the
yard
of
an
empty
house
off
pitt
street
have
you
been
able
to
discover
any
clue
as
to
who
put
them
there
not
one
the
horse
was
found
out
of
the
shafts
tied
to
the
wall
there
was
not
a
soul
about
the
place
wetherell
sat
down
again
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
at
that
instant
the
telephone
bell
in
the
corner
of
the
room
rang
sharply
i
jumped
up
and
went
across
to
it
placing
the
receivers
to
my
ears
i
heard
a
small
voice
say
is
that
wetherell
house
potts
point
yes
i
answered
who
is
speaking
hatteras
wetherell
however
is
in
the
room
who
are
you
detective
officer
will
you
tell
wetherell
that
draper
house
has
been
discovered
i
communicated
the
message
to
wetherell
and
then
the
inspector
joined
me
at
the
instrument
and
spoke
where
is
the
house
he
inquired
charlemagne
street
north
side
very
good
inspector
murdkin
speaking
let
plain
clothes
men
be
stationed
at
either
end
of
the
street
and
tell
them
to
be
on
the
look
out
for
draper
and
to
wait
for
me
i
start
for
the
house
at
once
he
rang
off
and
then
turned
to
me
are
you
too
tired
to
come
with
me
mr
hatteras
he
inquired
of
course
not
i
answered
let
us
go
at
once
god
bless
you
said
wetherell
i
hope
you
may
catch
the
fellow
bidding
him
we
went
downstairs
again
and
jumped
into
the
cab
which
was
directed
to
the
street
in
question
though
it
was
a
good
distance
from
our
in
less
than
half
an
hour
we
had
pulled
up
at
the
corner
as
the
cab
stopped
a
tall
man
dressed
in
blue
serge
who
had
been
standing
near
the
came
forward
and
touched
his
hat
williams
said
the
inspector
any
sign
of
our
man
not
one
sir
he
has
come
down
the
street
since
i
been
here
very
good
now
come
along
and
we
pay
the
house
a
visit
so
saying
he
told
the
cabman
to
follow
us
slowly
and
we
proceeded
down
the
street
about
along
he
stopped
and
pointed
to
a
house
on
the
opposite
side
that
is
the
house
his
lordship
mentioned
with
the
broken
windows
and
this
is
where
draper
dwells
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
see
the
eagles
are
on
either
side
of
the
steps
just
as
described
it
was
exactly
as
beckenham
had
told
us
even
to
the
extent
of
the
headless
eagle
on
the
left
of
the
walk
it
was
a
pretty
little
place
and
evidently
still
occupied
as
a
maid
was
busily
engaged
cleaning
the
steps
pushing
open
the
gate
the
inspector
entered
the
little
garden
and
accosted
the
girl
he
said
politely
pray
is
your
master
at
home
yes
sir
he
at
breakfast
just
now
well
would
you
mind
telling
him
that
two
gentlemen
would
like
to
see
him
yes
sir
the
girl
rose
to
her
feet
and
wiping
her
hands
on
her
apron
led
the
way
into
the
house
we
followed
close
behind
her
then
asking
us
to
wait
a
moment
where
we
were
she
knocked
at
a
door
on
the
right
and
opening
it
disappeared
within
now
said
the
inspector
our
man
will
probably
appear
and
we
shall
have
him
nicely
the
inspector
had
scarcely
spoken
before
the
door
opened
again
and
a
man
came
out
to
our
surprise
however
he
was
very
tall
and
stout
with
a
round
jovial
face
and
a
decided
air
of
being
satisfied
with
himself
and
the
world
in
general
to
what
do
i
owe
the
honour
of
this
visit
he
said
looking
at
the
inspector
i
am
an
inspector
of
police
as
you
see
answered
my
companion
and
we
are
looking
for
a
man
named
draper
who
yesterday
was
in
possession
of
this
house
i
am
afraid
you
have
made
some
little
mistake
returned
the
other
i
am
the
occupier
of
this
house
and
have
been
for
some
months
past
no
draper
has
anything
at
all
to
do
with
it
the
inspector
face
was
a
study
for
perfect
bewilderment
nor
could
mine
have
been
much
behind
it
the
marquis
had
given
such
a
minute
description
of
the
dwelling
opposite
and
the
two
stone
birds
on
the
steps
that
there
could
be
no
room
for
doubt
that
this
the
house
and
yet
it
was
physically
impossible
that
this
man
could
be
draper
and
if
it
were
the
place
where
beckenham
had
been
drugged
why
were
the
weapons
he
had
described
not
in
the
hall
i
can
not
understand
it
at
all
said
the
inspector
turning
to
me
this
is
the
house
and
yet
where
are
the
things
with
which
it
ought
to
be
furnished
you
have
a
description
of
the
furniture
then
said
the
owner
that
is
good
for
it
will
enable
me
to
prove
to
you
even
more
clearly
that
you
are
mistaken
pray
come
and
see
my
for
yourselves
he
led
the
way
into
the
apartment
from
which
he
had
been
summoned
and
we
followed
him
it
was
small
and
nicely
furnished
but
not
a
curio
or
native
weapon
was
to
be
seen
in
it
then
we
followed
him
to
the
corresponding
room
at
the
back
of
the
house
this
was
upholstered
in
the
latest
fashion
but
again
there
was
no
sign
of
what
beckenham
had
led
us
to
expect
we
should
find
we
were
completely
nonplussed
i
am
afraid
we
have
troubled
you
without
cause
said
the
inspector
as
we
passed
out
into
the
hall
again
do
mention
it
the
owner
answered
i
find
my
compensation
in
the
knowledge
that
i
am
not
involved
in
any
police
unpleasantness
by
the
way
said
the
inspector
suddenly
have
you
any
idea
who
your
neighbours
may
be
oh
dear
yes
the
man
replied
on
my
right
i
have
a
frigidly
respectable
widow
of
low
church
tendencies
on
my
left
the
chief
teller
of
the
bank
of
new
holland
in
that
case
we
can
only
apologize
for
our
intrusion
and
wish
you
pray
do
apologize
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
assisted
you
we
went
down
the
steps
again
and
out
into
the
street
as
we
passed
through
the
gate
the
inspector
stopped
and
examined
a
mark
on
the
post
then
he
stooped
and
picked
up
what
looked
like
a
pebble
having
done
so
we
resumed
our
walk
what
on
earth
can
be
the
meaning
of
it
all
i
asked
can
his
lordship
have
made
a
mistake
no
i
think
not
we
have
been
cleverly
duped
that
all
what
makes
you
think
so
i
did
think
so
until
we
passed
through
the
gate
on
our
way
out
now
i
certain
of
it
come
across
the
street
i
followed
him
across
the
road
to
a
small
house
with
a
bow
window
and
a
brass
plate
on
the
front
door
from
the
latter
i
discovered
that
the
proprietress
of
the
place
was
a
dressmaker
but
i
was
completely
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
we
were
visiting
her
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
the
inspector
asked
if
miss
tiffins
were
at
home
and
on
being
told
that
she
was
inquired
if
we
might
see
her
the
maid
went
away
to
find
out
and
presently
returned
and
begged
us
to
follow
her
we
did
so
down
a
small
passage
towards
the
door
of
the
room
which
contained
the
bow
window
miss
tiffins
bade
us
be
seated
and
then
asked
in
what
way
she
could
be
of
service
to
us
in
the
first
place
madam
said
the
inspector
a
serious
crime
has
been
perpetrated
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
it
may
be
in
your
power
to
give
us
a
clue
to
the
persons
who
committed
it
you
frighten
me
sir
replied
the
lady
i
can
not
at
all
see
in
what
way
i
can
help
you
i
lead
a
life
of
the
greatest
quietness
i
do
not
wish
to
imply
that
you
do
know
anything
of
them
i
only
want
you
to
carry
your
memory
back
as
far
as
yesterday
and
to
answer
me
the
few
simple
questions
i
may
ask
you
i
will
answer
them
to
the
best
of
my
ability
well
in
the
first
place
may
i
ask
if
you
remember
seeing
a
brougham
drive
up
to
that
house
opposite
about
yesterday
no
i
can
not
say
that
i
do
the
old
lady
replied
after
a
consideration
do
you
remember
seeing
a
number
of
men
leave
the
house
during
the
afternoon
no
if
they
came
out
i
did
not
notice
them
now
think
for
one
moment
if
you
please
and
tell
me
what
vehicles
if
any
you
remember
seeing
stop
there
let
me
try
to
remember
there
was
judge
baker
cart
about
three
the
milk
about
five
and
a
furniture
van
about
six
that
just
what
i
want
to
know
and
have
you
any
recollection
whose
furniture
van
it
was
yes
i
remember
reading
the
name
as
it
turned
round
goddard
james
george
street
i
wondered
if
the
tenant
was
going
to
move
the
inspector
rose
and
i
followed
his
example
i
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
miss
tiffins
you
have
helped
me
materially
i
am
glad
of
that
she
answered
but
i
trust
i
shall
not
be
wanted
to
give
evidence
in
court
you
need
have
no
fear
on
that
score
the
inspector
answered
when
we
had
left
the
house
the
inspector
turned
to
me
and
said
it
was
a
great
piece
of
luck
finding
a
dressmaker
opposite
commend
me
to
ladies
of
that
profession
for
knowing
what
goes
on
in
the
street
now
we
will
visit
goddard
james
and
see
who
hired
the
things
meantime
williams
here
he
called
the
constable
to
him
you
had
better
remain
here
and
watch
that
house
if
the
man
we
saw
comes
out
follow
him
and
let
me
know
where
he
goes
very
good
sir
the
constable
replied
and
we
left
him
to
his
vigil
then
hailing
a
passing
cab
we
jumped
into
it
and
directed
the
driver
to
convey
us
to
george
street
by
this
time
it
was
getting
on
for
and
we
were
both
worn
out
but
i
was
in
such
a
nervous
state
that
i
could
not
remain
inactive
phyllis
had
been
in
nikola
hands
nearly
fourteen
hours
and
so
far
we
had
not
obtained
one
single
definite
piece
of
information
as
to
her
whereabouts
arriving
at
the
shop
of
goddard
james
we
went
inside
and
asked
to
see
the
chief
partner
an
assistant
immediately
conveyed
us
to
an
office
at
the
rear
of
the
building
where
we
found
an
elderly
gentleman
writing
at
a
desk
he
looked
up
as
we
entered
and
then
seeing
the
inspector
uniform
rose
and
asked
our
business
the
day
before
yesterday
began
my
companion
you
supplied
a
gentleman
with
a
number
of
weapons
and
curios
on
hire
did
you
not
i
remember
doing
so
yes
was
the
old
gentleman
answer
what
about
it
only
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
favour
me
with
a
description
of
the
person
who
called
upon
you
about
them
or
a
glimpse
of
his
letter
if
he
wrote
he
called
and
saw
me
personally
ah
that
is
good
now
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
describe
him
well
in
the
first
place
he
was
very
tall
and
rather
handsome
he
had
if
i
remember
rightly
a
long
brown
moustache
and
was
decidedly
well
dressed
that
does
tell
us
very
much
does
it
was
he
alone
no
he
had
with
him
when
he
came
into
the
office
an
individual
whose
face
remains
fixed
in
my
memory
indeed
i
can
not
get
it
out
of
my
head
instantly
i
became
all
excitement
what
was
this
second
person
like
i
asked
well
i
can
hardly
tell
you
that
is
to
say
i
can
hardly
give
you
a
good
enough
description
of
him
to
make
you
see
him
as
i
saw
him
he
was
tall
and
yet
very
slim
had
black
hair
a
sallow
complexion
and
the
blackest
eyes
i
ever
saw
in
a
man
he
was
and
exquisitely
dressed
and
when
he
spoke
his
teeth
glittered
like
so
many
pearls
i
never
saw
another
man
like
him
in
my
life
nikola
for
a
thousand
i
cried
bringing
my
hand
down
with
a
thump
upon
the
table
it
looks
as
if
we
on
the
track
at
last
said
the
inspector
then
turning
to
goddard
again
and
may
i
ask
now
what
excuse
they
made
to
you
for
wanting
these
things
they
did
not
offer
any
they
simply
paid
a
certain
sum
down
for
the
hire
of
them
gave
me
their
address
and
then
left
and
the
address
was
charlemagne
street
our
van
took
the
things
there
and
fetched
them
away
last
night
thank
you
and
now
one
or
two
other
questions
what
name
did
the
hirer
give
eastover
when
they
left
your
shop
how
did
they
go
away
a
cab
was
waiting
at
the
door
for
them
and
i
walked
out
to
it
with
them
there
were
only
two
of
them
you
think
no
there
was
a
third
person
waiting
for
them
in
the
cab
and
it
was
that
very
circumstance
which
made
me
anxious
to
have
my
things
brought
back
as
soon
as
possible
if
i
had
been
able
to
i
should
have
even
declined
to
let
them
go
why
so
well
to
tell
you
that
would
involve
a
story
but
perhaps
i
had
better
tell
you
it
was
in
this
way
about
three
years
ago
through
a
distant
relative
i
got
to
know
a
man
named
draper
draper
i
cried
you
do
mean
but
there
i
beg
your
pardon
pray
go
on
as
i
say
i
got
to
know
this
man
draper
who
was
a
trader
we
met
once
or
twice
and
then
grew
more
intimate
so
friendly
did
we
at
last
become
that
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
put
some
money
into
a
scheme
he
proposed
to
me
it
was
a
total
failure
draper
proved
a
perfect
fraud
and
a
most
person
and
all
i
got
out
of
the
transaction
was
the
cases
of
curios
and
weapons
which
this
man
eastover
hired
from
me
it
was
because
when
i
went
out
with
my
customers
to
their
cab
i
saw
this
man
draper
waiting
for
them
that
i
became
uneasy
about
my
things
however
all
well
that
ends
well
and
as
they
returned
my
goods
and
paid
the
hire
i
must
not
grumble
and
now
tell
me
what
you
know

gentlemen
he
accompanied

to
the
door
and
then
bade
us
farewell

what
are
we
to
do
i
asked
well
first
i
am
going
back
to
the
office
to
put
a
man
on
to
find
this
schooner
and
then
i
going
to
take
an
hour
or
two
rest
by
that
time
we

his
victim

hope

where

you
going
now
back
to
potts
point
i
answered
we
thereupon
bade
each
other
farewell
and
set
off
in
different
directions
when
i
reached
wetherell
house
i
learned
from
the
butler
that
his
master
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
library
not
wishing
to
disturb
him
i
inquired
the
whereabouts
of
my
own
bedroom
and
on
being
conducted
to
it
laid
myself
down
fully
dressed
upon
the
bed
so
utterly
worn
out
was
i
that
my
head
had
no
sooner
touched
the
pillow
than
i
was
fast
asleep
how
long
i
lay
there
i
do
not
know
but
when
i
woke
it
was
to
find
wetherell
standing
beside
me
holding
a
letter
in
his
hand
he
was
white
as
a
sheet
and
trembling
in
every
limb
read
this
hatteras
he
cried
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
we
are
to
do
i
sat
up
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
read
the
letter
he
handed
to
me
it
was
written
in
what
was
evidently
a
disguised
hand
on
common
and
ran
to
wetherell
potts
point
sydney
dear
sir
this
is
to
inform
you
that
your
daughter
is
in
very
safe
keeping
if
you
wish
to
find
her
you
had
better
be
quick
about
it
more
you
had
better
give
up
consulting
the
police
and
such
like
in
the
hope
of
getting
hold
of
her
the
only
way
you
get
her
will
be
to
act
as
follows
at
eight
charter
a
boat
and
pull
down
the
harbour
as
far
as
shark
point
when
you
get
there
light
your
pipe
three
times
and
some
one
in
a
boat
near
by
will
do
the
same
be
sure
to
bring
with
you
the
sum
of
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
gold
and
this
is
most
important
bring
with
you
the
little
stick
you
got
from
china
pete
or
do
not
come
at
above
all
do
not
bring
more
than
one
man
if
you
do
not
put
in
an
appearance
you
will
not
hear
of
your
daughter
again
yours
obediently
the
man
who
knows
chapter
iv
following
up
a
clue
for
some
moments
after
i
had
perused
the
curious
epistle
wetherell
had
brought
to
my
room
i
remained
wrapped
in
thought
what
do
you
make
of
it
my
companion
asked
i
do
know
what
to
say
i
answered
looking
at
it
again
one
thing
however
is
quite
certain
and
that
is
that
despite
its
curious
wording
it
is
intended
you
should
take
it
seriously
you
think
so
i
do
indeed
but
i
think
when
the
inspector
arrives
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
show
it
to
him
what
do
you
say
i
agree
with
you
let
us
defer
consideration
of
it
until
we
see
him
when
an
hour
later
the
inspector
put
in
an
appearance
the
letter
was
accordingly
placed
before
him
and
his
opinion
asked
concerning
it
he
read
it
through
without
comment
carefully
examined
the
writing
and
signature
and
finally
held
it
up
to
the
light
having
done
this
he
turned
to
me
and
said
have
you
that
envelope
we
found
at
the
mr
hatteras
i
took
it
out
of
my
pocket
and
handed
it
to
him
he
then
placed
it
on
the
table
side
by
side
with
the
letter
and
through
a
scrutinized
both
carefully
having
done
so
he
asked
for
the
envelope
in
which
it
had
arrived
wetherell
had
thrown
it
into
the
basket
but
a
moment
search
brought
it
to
light
again
he
scrutinized
both
the
first
envelope
and
the
letter
and
then
compared
them
with
the
second
cover
yes
i
thought
so
he
said
this
letter
was
written
either
by
nikola
or
at
his
desire
the
paper
is
the
same
as
that
he
purchased
at
the
stationer
shop
we
visited
and
what
had
we
better
do
now
queried
wetherell
who
had
been
eagerly
waiting
for
his
opinion
we
must
think
said
the
inspector
in
the
first
place
i
suppose
you
do
feel
inclined
to
pay
the
large
sum
mentioned
here
not
if
i
can
help
it
of
course
answered
wetherell
but
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
and
i
can
not
rescue
my
poor
girl
any
other
way
i
would
sacrifice
even
more
than
that
well
we
see
if
we
can
find
her
without
compelling
you
to
pay
anything
at
all
the
inspector
cried
i
got
an
idea
in
my
head
and
what
is
that
i
cried
for
i
too
had
been
thinking
out
a
plan
well
first
and
foremost
he
answered
i
want
you
wetherell
to
tell
me
all
you
can
about
your
servants
let
us
begin
with
the
butler
how
long
has
he
been
with
you
nearly
twenty
years
a
good
and
trustworthy
servant
i
presume
to
the
last
degree
i
have
implicit
confidence
in
him
then
we
may
dismiss
him
from
our
minds
i
think
i
saw
a
footman
in
the
hall
how
long
has
he
been
with
you
just
about
three
months
and
what
sort
of
a
fellow
is
he
i
really
could
not
tell
you
very
much
he
seems
intelligent
quick
and
willing
and
up
to
his
work
is
your
cook
a
man
or
a
woman
a
woman
she
has
been
with
me
since
before
my
wife
death
that
is
to
say
nearly
ten
years
you
need
have
no
suspicion
of
her
housemaids
two
both
have
been
with
me
some
time
and
seem
steady
respectable
girls
there
is
also
a
kitchen
maid
but
she
has
been
with
me
nearly
as
long
as
my
cook
and
i
would
stake
my
reputation
on
her
integrity
well
in
that
case
the
only
person
who
seems
at
all
suspicious
is
the
footman
may
we
have
him
up
with
pleasure
i
ring
for
him
wetherell
rang
the
bell
and
a
moment
later
it
was
answered
by
the
man
himself
come
in
james
and
shut
the
door
behind
you
his
master
said
the
man
did
as
he
was
ordered
but
not
without
looking
as
i
thought
a
little
uncomfortable
the
inspector
i
could
see
had
noticed
this
too
for
he
had
been
watching
him
intently
ever
since
he
had
appeared
in
the
room
james
said
wetherell
the
inspector
of
police
wishes
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
answer
him
to
the
best
of
your
ability
to
begin
with
said
the
inspector
i
want
you
to
look
at
this
envelope
have
you
seen
it
before
he
handed
him
the
envelope
of
the
anonymous
letter
addressed
to
wetherell
the
man
took
it
and
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
yes
sir
he
said
i
have
seen
it
before
i
took
it
in
at
the
front
door
from
whom
from
a
little
old
woman
sir
the
man
answered
a
little
old
woman
cried
the
inspector
evidently
surprised
what
sort
of
woman
well
sir
i
do
know
that
i
can
give
you
much
of
a
description
of
her
she
was
very
small
had
a
sort
of
face
a
little
black
poke
bonnet
and
walked
with
a
stick
should
you
know
her
again
if
you
saw
her
oh
yes
sir
did
she
say
anything
when
she
gave
you
the
letter
only
wetherell
young
man
that
was
all
sir
and
you
did
ask
if
there
was
an
answer
that
was
rather
a
singular
omission
on
your
part
was
it
not
she
did
give
me
time
sir
she
just
put
it
into
my
hand
and
went
down
the
steps
again
that
will
do
now
wetherell
i
think
we
better
see
about
getting
that
money
from
the
bank
you
need
not
wait
my
man
the
footman
thereupon
left
the
room
while
both
wetherell
and
i
stared
at
the
inspector
in
complete
astonishment
he
laughed
you
are
wondering
why
i
said
that
he
remarked
i
must
confess
it
struck
me
as
curious
well
let
me
tell
you
i
did
it
with
a
purpose
did
you
notice
that
young
man
face
when
he
entered
the
room
and
when
i
gave
him
the
letter
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
he
is
in
the
secret
you
mean
that
he
is
in
nikola
employ
then
why
do
you
arrest
him
because
i
want
to
be
quite
certain
first
i
said
that
about
the
money
because
if
he
is
nikola
agent
he
will
carry
the
information
to
him
and
by
so
doing
keep
your
daughter
in
sydney
for
at
least
a
day
longer
do
you
see
i
do
and
i
admire
your
diplomacy
now
what
is
your
plan
may
i
first
tell
mine
i
said
do
said
the
inspector
for
mine
is
not
quite
matured
yet
well
i
said
my
idea
is
this
i
propose
that
wetherell
shall
obtain
from
his
bank
a
number
of
gold
bags
fill
them
with
lead
discs
to
represent
coin
and
let
it
leak
out
before
this
man
that
he
has
got
the
money
in
the
house
then
wetherell
will
set
off
for
the
i
will
row
him
down
the
harbour
disguised
as
a
boatman
we
will
pick
up
the
boat
as
arranged
in
that
letter
in
the
meantime
you
must
start
from
the
other
side
in
a
police
boat
pull
up
to
meet
us
and
arrest
the
man
then
we
will
force
him
to
disclose
miss
whereabouts
and
act
upon
his
information
what
do
you
say
it
certainly
sound
feasible
said
the
inspector
and
wetherell
nodded
his
head
approvingly
at
that
moment
the
marquis
entered
the
room
looking
much
better
than
when
we
had
found
him
on
the
preceding
night
and
the
conversation
branched
off
into
a
different
channel
my
plot
seemed
to
commend
itself
so
much
to
wetherell
judgment
that
he
ordered
his
carriage
and
drove
off
there
and
then
to
his
bank
while
i
went
down
to
the
harbour
arranged
about
a
boat
and
having
done
so
proceeded
up
to
the
town
where
i
purchased
a
false
beard
an
old
dungaree
suit
such
as
a
man
loafing
about
the
harbour
might
wear
and
a
slouch
hat
of
villainous
appearance
by
the
time
i
got
back
to
the
house
wetherell
had
returned
with
great
delight
he
conducted
me
to
his
study
and
opening
his
safe
showed
me
a
number
of
canvas
bags
on
each
of
which
was
printed
but
surely
there
are
not
there
no
said
the
old
gentleman
with
a
chuckle
there
is
the
counterfeit
of
there
for
the
rest
i
propose
to
show
him
these
so
saying
he
dived
his
hand
into
a
drawer
and
produced
a
sheaf
of
crisp
there
these
are
notes
for
the
balance
of
the
amount
but
you
surely
are
not
going
to
pay
i
thought
we
were
going
to
try
to
catch
the
rascals
without
letting
any
money
change
hands
so
we
are
do
not
be
afraid
if
you
will
only
glance
at
these
notes
you
will
see
that
they
are
dummies
every
one
of
them
they
are
for
me
to
exhibit
to
the
man
in
the
boat
in
the
dark
they
pass
muster
never
fear
very
good
indeed
i
said
with
a
laugh
by
the
time
they
can
be
properly
examined
we
shall
have
the
police
at
hand
ready
to
capture
him
i
believe
we
shall
the
old
gentleman
cried
rubbing
his
hands
together
in
delight
i
believe
we
shall
and
a
nice
example
we
make
of
the
rascals
nikola
thinks
he
can
beat
me
i
show
him
how
mistaken
he
is
and
for
some
time
the
old
gentleman
continued
in
this
strain
confidently
believing
that
he
would
have
his
daughter
with
him
again
by
the
time
morning
came
nor
was
i
far
behind
him
in
confidence
since
nikola
had
not
spirited
her
out
of
the
country
my
plot
seemed
the
one
of
all
others
to
enable
us
to
regain
possession
of
her
and
not
only
that
but
we
hoped
it
would
give
us
an
opportunity
of
punishing
those
who
had
so
schemed
against
her
suddenly
an
idea
was
born
in
my
brain
and
instantly
i
acted
on
it
wetherell
i
said
supposing
when
your
daughter
is
safe
again
i
presume
so
far
as
once
more
to
offer
myself
for
your
what
will
you
say
what
will
i
say
he
cried
why
i
will
tell
you
that
you
shall
have
her
my
boy
with
ten
thousand
blessings
on
your
head
i
know
you
now
and
since
i
treated
you
so
badly
and
you
taken
such
a
noble
revenge
why
i
make
it
up
to
you
or
my
name
not
wetherell
but
we
wo
talk
any
more
about
that
till
we
have
got
possession
of
her
we
have
other
and
more
important
things
to
think
of
what
time
ought
we
to
start
the
letter
fixes
the
meeting
for
ten
we
had
better
be
in
the
boat
by
nine
in
the
meantime
i
should
advise
you
to
take
a
little
rest
by
the
way
do
you
think
your
footman
realizes
that
you
have
the
money
he
ought
to
for
he
carried
it
up
to
this
room
for
me
and
more
he
has
applied
for
a
holiday
this
afternoon
that
to
carry
the
information
very
good
everything
is
working
excellently
now
i
off
to
rest
for
a
little
while
i
follow
your
example
in
the
meantime
i
give
orders
for
an
early
dinner
we
dined
at
seven
sharp
and
at
eight
i
went
off
to
my
room
to
don
my
disguise
then
bidding
the
marquis
much
to
the
young
gentleman
disgust
for
he
was
most
anxious
to
accompany
us
i
slipped
quietly
out
of
my
window
crossed
the
garden
i
hoped
unobserved
and
then
went
down
to
the
harbour
side
where
the
boat
i
had
chartered
was
waiting
for
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
carriage
drove
up
and
on
seeing
it
i
went
across
and
opened
the
door
my
disguise
was
so
perfect
that
for
a
moment
the
old
gentleman
seemed
undecided
whether
to
trust
me
or
not
but
my
voice
when
i
spoke
reassured
him
and
then
we
set
to
work
carrying
the
bags
of
spurious
money
down
to
the
boat
as
soon
as
this
was
accomplished
we
stepped
in
i
seated
myself
and
got
out
the
oars
wetherell
taking
the
in
the
stern
then
we
shoved
off
and
made
our
way
out
into
the
harbour
it
was
a
dull
cloudy
night
with
hardly
a
sign
of
a
star
in
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
heaven
while
every
few
minutes
a
cold
cheerless
wind
swept
across
the
water
so
chilly
indeed
was
it
that
before
we
had
gone
very
far
i
began
to
wish
i
had
added
an
overcoat
to
my
other
disguises
we
hardly
spoke
but
pulled
slowly
down
towards
the
island
mentioned
in
the
letter
the
strain
on
our
nerves
was
intense
and
i
must
confess
to
feeling
decidedly
nervous
as
i
wondered
what
would
happen
if
the
police
boat
did
not
pull
up
to
meet
us
as
we
had
that
morning
arranged
a
quarter
to
ten
chimed
from
some
church
ashore
as
we
approached
within
a
hundred
yards
of
our
destination
then
i
rested
on
my
oars
and
waited
all
round
us
were
the
lights
of
bigger
craft
but
no
could
i
see
about
five
minutes
before
the
hour
i
whispered
to
wetherell
to
make
ready
and
in
answer
the
old
gentleman
took
a
matchbox
from
his
pocket
exactly
as
the
town
clocks
struck
the
hour
he
lit
a
vesta
it
flared
a
little
and
then
went
out
as
it
did
so
a
boat
shot
out
of
the
darkness
to
port
he
struck
a
second
and
then
a
third
as
the
last
one
burned
up
and
then
died
away
the
man
rowing
the
boat
i
have
just
referred
to
struck
a
light
then
another
then
another
in
rapid
succession
having
finished
his
display
he
took
up
his
oars
and
propelled
his
boat
towards
us
when
he
was
within
talking
distance
he
said
in
a
gruff
voice
is
wetherell
aboard
to
this
my
companion
immediately
answered
with
a
tremble
in
his
voice
yes
here
i
am
money
all
right
can
you
see
if
i
hold
it
up
asked
wetherell
as
he
spoke
a
long
black
boat
came
into
view
on
the
other
side
of
our
questioner
and
pulled
slowly
towards
him
it
was
the
police
boat
no
i
do
want
to
see
said
the
voice
again
but
this
is
the
message
i
was
to
give
you
pull
in
towards
circular
quay
and
find
the
of
the
barque
go
aboard
her
and
take
your
money
down
into
the
cuddy
there
you
get
your
answer
nothing
more
cried
wetherell
that
all
i
was
told
answered
the
man
and
then
said
at
the
same
moment
the
police
boat
pulled
up
alongside
him
and
made
fast
i
saw
a
dark
figure
enter
his
boat
and
next
moment
the
glare
of
a
lantern
fell
upon
the
man
face
i
picked
up
my
oars
and
pulled
over
to
them
getting
there
just
in
time
to
hear
the
inspector
ask
the
man
his
name
james
burbidge
was
the
reply
i
do
know
as
how
you
got
anything
against
me
i
a
licensed
waterman
i
am
very
likely
said
the
inspector
but
i
want
a
little
explanation
from
you
how
do
you
come
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
business
what
about
this
message
mean
yes
about
this
message
where
is
it
from
who
gave
it
to
you
well
if
you
let
me
go
i
tell
you
all
about
it
growled
the
man
i
was
up
at
the
and
this
evenin
just
afore
dark
takin
a
nobbler
along
with
a
friend
presently
in
comes
a
cove
in
a
cloak
he
beckons
me
outside
and
says
you
want
to
earn
a
sufring
a
sufring
is
twenty
bob
so
i
says
word
i
do
then
he
says
you
go
out
on
the
harbour
and
be
down
agin
shark
point
at
ten
i
said
i
would
and
so
i
was
see
a
boat
there
with
an
old
gent
in
it
says
he
strike
three
matches
and
you
do
the
same
then
ask
him
if
he
wetherell
if
he
says
yes
ask
him
if

if
he
says
yes
to
that
tell
him
to
pull
in
towards

quay
and
find
the
of
the
barque
he
to
take
his
money
down
to
the
cuddy
and
he
get
his
answer
there
that
the
truth
so
me
bob
i
do
know
what
you
wants
to
go
arrestin
of
an
honest
man
for
the
inspector
turned
to
the
water
police
does
any
man
here
know
james
burbidge
two
or
three
voices
immediately
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
this
seemed
to
decide
the
officer
for
he
turned
to
the
waterman
again
and
said
as
some
of
my
men
seem
to
know
you
i
let
you
off
but
for
your
own
sake
go
home
and
keep
a
silent
tongue
he
thereupon
clambered
back
into
his
own
boat
and
bade
the
man
depart
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
he
was
out
of
sight
we
then
drew
up
alongside
the
police
boat
what
had
we
better
do
mr
inspector
asked
wetherell
find
the
of
the
at
once
she
an
untenanted
ship
being
for
sale
you
will
go
aboard
sir
with
your
companion
and
down
to
the
cuddy
do
take
your
money
however
we
draw
up
alongside
as
soon
as
you
below
and
when
one
of
their
gang
whom
you
despatch
for
it
comes
up
to
get
the
coin
we
collar
him
and
then
come
to
your
assistance
do
you
understand
perfectly
but
how
are
we
to
know
the
vessel
well
the
better
plan
would
be
for
you
to
follow
us
we
pull
to
within
a
hundred
yards
of
her
i
learn
from
one
of
my
men
here
that
she
painted
white
so
you
have
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
her
very
well
then
go
on
and
we
follow
you
the
police
boat
accordingly
set
off
and
we
followed
about
fifty
yards
behind
her
a
thick
drizzle
was
now
falling
and
it
was
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
to
keep
her
in
sight
for
some
time
we
pulled
on
presently
we
began
to
get
closer
to
her
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
alongside
there
your
craft
said
the
inspector
pointing
as
he
spoke
to
a
big
vessel
showing
dimly
through
the
scud
to
starboard
of
us
pull
over
to
her
i
followed
his
instructions
and
arriving
at
the
vessel
side
hitched
on
made
the
painter
fast
and
then
having
clambered
aboard
assisted
wetherell
to
do
the
same
as
soon
as
we
had
both
gained
the
deck
we
stood
and
looked
about
us
at
the
same
time
listening
for
any
sound
which
might
proclaim
the
presence
of
the
men
we
had
come
to
meet
but
save
the
sighing
of
the
wind
in
the
shrouds
overhead
the
dismal
creaking
of
blocks
and
the
drip
of
moisture
upon
the
deck
no
sign
was
to
be
heard
there
was
nothing
for
it
therefore
but
to
make
our
way
below
as
best
we
could
fortunately
i
had
had
the
forethought
to
bring
with
me
a
small
piece
of
candle
which
came
in
very
handily
at
the
present
juncture
seeing
that
the
cuddy
when
we
reached
the
companion
ladder
was
wrapt
in
total
darkness
very
carefully
i
stepped
inside
lit
the
candle
and
then
with
wetherell
at
my
heels
made
my
way
down
the
steps
arriving
at
the
bottom
we
found
ourselves
in
a
saloon
of
the
type
three
cabins
stood
on
either
side
while
from
the
bottom
of
the
companion
ladder
by
which
we
had
descended
to
a
long
cushioned
locker
right
aft
under
the
wheel
ran
a
table
covered
with
american
cloth
but
there
was
no
man
of
any
kind
to
be
seen
i
opened
cabin
after
cabin
and
searched
each
with
a
like
result
we
were
evidently
quite
alone
in
the
ship
what
do
you
make
of
it
all
i
asked
of
wetherell
it
looks
extremely
suspicious
he
answered
perhaps
we
too
early
for
them
but
see
hatteras
there
something
on
the
table
at
the
farther
end
so
there
was
something
that
looked
very
much
like
a
letter
together
we
went
round
to
the
end
of
the
table
and
there
surely
enough
found
a
letter
pinned
to
the
american
cloth
and
addressed
to
my
companion
in
a
bold
but
rather
quaint
handwriting
it
for
you
wetherell
i
said
removing
the
pins
and
presenting
it
to
him
thereupon
we
sat
down
beside
the
table
and
he
broke
the
seal
with
trembling
fingers
it
was
not
a
very
long
epistle
and
ran
my
dear
wetherell
bags
of
imitation
money
and
spurious
will
not
avail
you
nor
is
it
politic
to
arrange
that
the
water
police
should
meet
you
on
the
harbour
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
me
you
have
lost
your
opportunity
and
your
daughter
accordingly
leaves
australia
i
will
however
give
you
one
more
chance
take
care
that
you
make
the
most
of
it
the
sum
i
now
ask
is
the
stick
given
you
by
china
and
must
be
paid
without
inquiry
of
any
sort
if
you
are
agreeable
to
this
advertise
as
follows
will
pay
and
give
stick
in
the
agony
column
morning
on
the
and
of
this
present
month
arrangements
will
then
be
made
with
you
the
man
who
knows
oh
my
god
i
ruined
all
cried
wetherell
as
he
put
the
letter
down
on
the
table
and
who
knows
i
may
have
killed
my
poor
child
seeing
his
misery
i
did
my
best
to
comfort
him
but
it
was
no
use
he
seemed
utterly
broken
down
by
the
failure
of
our
scheme
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
my
own
heart
was
quite
as
heavy
one
thing
was
very
certain
there
was
a
traitor
in
our
camp
some
one
had
overheard
our
plans
and
carried
them
elsewhere
could
it
be
the
footman
if
so
he
should
have
it
made
hot
for
him
when
i
got
sufficient
proof
against
him
i
could
promise
him
that
most
certainly
while
i
was
thinking
over
this
i
heard
a
footstep
on
the
companion
stairs
and
a
moment
later
the
inspector
made
his
appearance
his
astonishment
at
finding
us
alone
reading
a
letter
by
the
light
of
one
solitary
candle
was
unmistakable
for
he
said
as
he
came
towards
us
and
sat
down
why
how
this
where
are
the
men
there
are
none
we
been
nicely
sold
i
answered
handing
him
the
letter
he
perused
it
without
further
remark
and
when
he
had
done
so
sat
drumming
with
his
fingers
upon
the
table
in
thought
we
shall
have
to
look
in
your
own
house
for
the
person
who
has
given
us
away
mr
wetherell
he
said
at
last
the
folk
who
are
running
this
affair
are
as
cute
as
men
are
made
nowadays
it
a
pleasure
to
measure
swords
with
them
what
do
you
think
our
next
move
had
better
be
get
home
as
fast
as
we
can
i
return
with
you
and
we
talk
it
over
it
no
use
our
remaining
here
we
accordingly
went
on
deck
and
descended
to
our
wherry
again
this
time
the
inspector
accompanied
us
while
the
police
boat
set
off
down
the
harbour
on
other
business
when
we
had
seen
it
pull
out
into
the
darkness
we
threw
the
imitation
money
overboard
pushed
off
for
the
shore
landed
where
we
had
first
embarked
and
then
walked
up
to
wetherell
house
it
was
considerably
after
twelve
by
the
time
we
reached
it
but
the
butler
was
still
sitting
up
for
us
his
disappointment
seemed
as
keen
as
ours
when
he
discovered
that
we
had
returned
without
his
young
mistress
he
followed
us
up
to
the
study
with
spirits
and
glasses
and
then
at
his
master
instruction
went
off
to
bed
now
gentlemen
began
wetherell
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
him
let
us
discuss
the
matter
thoroughly
but
before
we
begin
may
i
offer
you
cigars
the
inspector
took
one
but
i
declined
stating
that
i
preferred
a
pipe
but
my
pipe
was
in
my
bedroom
which
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
passage
so
asking
them
to
wait
for
me
i
went
to
fetch
it
i
left
the
room
shutting
the
door
behind
me
but
it
so
happened
that
the
had
been
moved
and
it
was
some
minutes
before
i
could
find
it
having
done
so
however
i
blew
out
my
candle
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
which
was
exactly
opposite
the
study
when
i
heard
the
green
baize
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
open
and
a
light
footstep
come
along
the
corridor
instantly
i
stood
perfectly
still
and
waited
to
see
who
it
might
be
closer
and
closer
the
step
came
till
i
saw
in
the
half
dark
the
pretty
figure
of
one
of
the
parlour
maids
on
she
crept
up
to
the
study
door
and
then
stooping
down
listened
at
the
keyhole
instantly
i
was
on
the
alert
every
nerve
strained
to
watch
her
for
nearly
five
minutes
she
stood
there
and
then
with
a
glance
round
tiptoed
quietly
along
the
passage
again
closing
the
baize
door
after
her
when
she
was
safely
out
of
hearing
i
crossed
to
the
study
both
the
inspector
and
wetherell
saw
that
something
had
happened
and
were
going
to
question
me
but
i
held
up
my
hand
do
ask
any
questions
but
tell
me
as
quickly
and
as
nearly
as
you
can
what
you
have
been
talking
about
during
the
last
five
minutes
i
said
why
do
stop
to
ask
questions
believe
in
the
importance
of
my
haste
what
was
it
i
have
only
been
giving
wetherell
a
notion
of
the
steps
i
propose
to
take
said
the
inspector
thank
you
now
i
off
do
sit
up
for
me
wetherell
i
going
to
follow
up
a
clue
that
may
put
us
on
the
right
scent
at
last
i
think
you
had
better
come
mr
inspector
but
i
meet
you
here
again
at
six
you
ca
explain
i
suppose
said
the
latter
looking
a
little
huffed
i
afraid
not
i
answered
but
i
tell
you
this
much
i
saw
one
of
the
female
servants
listening
at
this
door
she
be
off
if
i
mistake
not
with
the
news
she
has
picked
up
and
i
want
to
watch
her
and
good
luck
to
you
without
another
word
i
slipped
off
my
boots
and
carrying
them
in
my
hand
left
the
room
and
went
downstairs
to
the
this
apartment
looked
out
over
the
garden
and
possessed
a
window
shaded
by
a
big
tree
opening
it
i
jumped
out
and
carefully
closed
it
after
me
then
pausing
for
a
moment
to
resume
my
boots
i
crept
quietly
down
the
path
jumped
a
low
wall
and
so
passed
into
the
back
street
about
fifty
yards
from
the
tradesmen
entrance
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
there
was
a
big
moreton
bay
under
this
i
took
my
stand
and
turned
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
house
it
was
a
dark
night
so
that
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
for
any
one
across
the
way
to
have
detected
my
presence
for
some
minutes
i
waited
and
was
beginning
to
wonder
if
i
could
have
been
deceived
when
i
heard
the
soft
click
of
a
latch
and
next
moment
a
small
dark
figure
passed
out
into
the
street
and
closed
the
gate
after
it
then
pausing
a
moment
as
if
to
make
up
her
mind
for
the
mysterious
person
was
a
woman
she
set
off
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
city
i
followed
about
a
hundred
yards
behind
her
with
the
exception
of
one
policeman
who
stared
very
hard
at
me
we
did
not
meet
a
soul
once
or
twice
i
nearly
lost
her
and
when
we
reached
the
city
itself
i
began
to
see
that
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
decrease
the
difference
that
separated
us
if
i
did
not
wish
to
bid
to
her
altogether
i
accordingly
hastened
my
steps
and
in
this
fashion
we
passed
up
one
street
and
down
another
until
we
reached
what
i
can
not
help
thinking
must
have
been
the
lowest
quarter
of
sydney
on
either
hand
were
chinese
names
and
marine
stores
slop
shops
with
pawnbrokers
and
galore
while
in
this
locality
few
of
the
inhabitants
seemed
to
have
any
idea
of
what
bed
meant
groups
of
men
and
women
were
clustered
at
the
corners
and
on
one
occasion
the
person
i
was
pursuing
was
stopped
by
them
but
she
evidently
knew
how
to
take
care
of
herself
for
she
was
soon
marching
on
her
way
again
at
the
end
of
one
long
and
filthily
dirty
street
she
paused
and
looked
about
her
i
had
crossed
the
road
just
before
this
and
was
scarcely
ten
yards
behind
her
pulling
my
hat
well
down
to
shade
my
face
and
sticking
my
hands
in
my
pockets
i
staggered
and
reeled
along
doing
my
best
to
imitate
the
gait
of
a
drunken
man
seeing
only
me
about
she
went
up
to
the
window
of
a
corner
house
and
tapped
with
her
knuckles
thrice
upon
the
glass
before
one
could
have
counted
twenty
the
door
of
the
dwelling
was
opened
and
she
passed
in
now
i
was
in
a
nasty
fix
either
i
must
be
content
to
abandon
my
errand
or
i
must
get
inside
the
building
and
trust
to
luck
to
procure
the
information
i
wanted
fortunately
in
my
present
disguise
the
girl
would
be
hardly
likely
to
recognize
her
master
guest
so
giving
them
time
to
get
into
a
room
i
also
went
up
to
the
door
and
turned
the
handle
to
my
delight
it
was
unlocked
i
opened
it
and
entered
the
house
the
passage
was
in
total
darkness
but
i
could
make
out
where
the
door
of
the
room
i
wanted
to
find
was
located
by
a
thin
streak
of
light
low
down
upon
the
floor
as
softly
as
i
possibly
could
i
crept
up
to
it
and
bent
down
to
look
through
the
keyhole
the
view
was
necessarily
limited
but
i
could
just
make
out
the
girl
i
had
followed
sitting
upon
a
bed
while
leaning
against
the
wall
a
dirty
clay
pipe
in
her
mouth
was
the
vilest
old
woman
i
have
ever
in
my
life
set
eyes
on
she
was
very
small
with
a
face
dressed
in
an
old
bit
of
tawdry
finery
more
than
three
sizes
too
large
for
her
her
hair
fell
upon
her
shoulders
in
a
tangled
mass
and
from
under
it
her
eyes
gleamed
out
like
those
of
a
wicked
little
scotch
terrier
ready
to
bite
as
i
bent
down
to
listen
i
heard
her
say
well
my
pretty
dear
and
what
information
have
you
got
for
the
gentleman
that
brings
you
down
at
this
time
of
night
only
that
the
are
going
to
start
at
daylight
looking
for
the
i
heard
the
inspector
say
so
himself
at
daylight
are
they
croaked
the
old
hag
well
i
wish
joy
of
their
search
i
do
them
them
any
more
news
my
dear
the
master
and
that
slab
of
a
hatteras
went
out
down
the
harbour
the
old
man
brought
home
a
lot
of
money
bags
but
what
was
in
was
only
dummies
i
know
that
too
my
dear
nicely
they
was
sold
ha
ha
she
chuckled
like
an
old
fiend
and
then
began
to
cut
up
another
pipe
of
tobacco
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
like
a
man
she
smoked
negro
head
and
the
reek
of
it
came
out
through
the
keyhole
to
me
but
the
younger
woman
was
evidently
impatient
for
she
rose
and
said
when
do
they
sail
with
the
girl
sally
they
gone
my
dear
they
went
at
ten
at
this
news
my
heart
began
to
throb
painfully
they
were
long
about
it
said
the
younger
girl
that
nikola
not
long
about
anything
remarked
the
old
woman
i
hope
pipa
lannu
will
agree
with
her
health
the
minx
i
do
the
younger
remarked
spitefully
now
where
the
money
he
said
i
was
to
have
give
it
to
me
and
let
me
be
off
i
shall
get
the
sack
if
this
is
found
out
it
was
five
pound
i
was
to
give
yer
was
it
the
elder
woman
said
ten
said
the
younger
sharply
no
larks
sally
i
know
too
much
for
you
oh
you
know
a
lot
honey
do
you
of
course
you
be
expected
to
know
more
than
old
aunt
sally
who
never
seen
anything
at
all
would
you
go
along
with
you
hand
me
over
the
money
i
say
and
let
me
be
off
of
course
you
do
know
a
lot
more
do
you
there
a
pound
while
they
were
wrangling
over
the
payment
i
crept
down
the
passage
again
to
the
front
door
once
i
had
reached
it
i
opened
it
softly
and
went
out
closing
it
carefully
behind
me
then
i
took
to
my
heels
and
ran
down
the
street
in
the
direction
i
had
come
inquiring
my
way
here
and
there
from
policemen
i
eventually
reached
home
scaled
the
wall
and
went
across
the
garden
to
the
window
this
i
opened
and
by
its
help
made
my
way
into
the
house
and
upstairs
as
i
had
expected
that
he
would
have
gone
to
bed
my
astonishment
was
considerable
at
meeting
wetherell
on
the
landing
well
what
have
you
discovered
he
asked
anxiously
as
i
came
up
to
him
information
of
the
greatest
importance
i
answered
but
one
other
thing
first
call
up
your
housekeeper
and
tell
her
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
one
of
the
maids
is
not
in
the
house
warn
her
not
to
mention
you
in
the
matter
but
to
discharge
the
girl
before
breakfast
by
the
time
you
done
that
i
have
changed
my
things
and
be
ready
to
tell
you
everything
i
go
and
rouse
her
at
once
i
all
impatience
to
know
what
you
have
discovered
he
left
me
and
passed
through
the
green
baize
door
to
the
wing
while
i
went
to
my
bedroom
and
changed
my
things
this
done
i
passed
into
the
study
where
i
found
a
meal
awaiting
me
to
this
i
did
ample
justice
for
my
long
walk
and
the
excitement
of
the
evening
had
given
me
an
unusual
appetite
just
as
i
was
cutting
myself
a
third
slice
of
beef
wetherell
returned
and
informed
me
that
the
housekeeper
was
on
the
alert
and
would
receive
the
girl
on
her
reappearance
now
tell
me
of
your
doings
said
the
old
gentleman
i
thereupon
narrated
all
that
had
occurred
and
when
i
had
finished
he
said
do
you
believe
then
that
my
poor
girl
has
been
carried
off
by
nikola
to
this
island
called
pipa
lannu
i
do
well
then
what
are
we
to
do
to
rescue
her
shall
i
ask
the
government
to
send
a
gunboat
down
if
you
think
it
best
but
for
my
own
part
i
must
own
i
should
act
independently
of
them
you
do
want
to
make
a
big
sensation
i
presume
and
remember
to
arrest
nikola
would
be
to
open
the
whole
affair
then
what
do
you
propose
i
propose
i
answered
that
we
charter
a
small
schooner
fit
her
out
select
half
a
dozen
trustworthy
and
silent
men
and
then
take
our
departure
for
pipa
lannu
i
am
well
acquainted
with
the
island
and
what
more
i
hold
a
master
certificate
we
would
sail
in
after
dark
arm
all
our
party
thoroughly
and
go
ashore
i
expect
they
will
be
keeping
your
daughter
a
prisoner
in
a
hut
if
that
is
so
we
will
surround
it
and
rescue
her
without
any
trouble
and
what
is
better
still
without
any
public
scandal
what
do
you
think
i
quite
agree
with
what
you
say
i
think
it
an
excellent
idea
and
while
you
been
speaking
i
too
have
been
thinking
of
something
there
my
old
friend
mcmurtough
who
has
a
nice
steam
yacht
i
sure
he
be
willing
to
let
us
have
the
use
of
her
where
does
he
live
far
from
here
his
office
would
be
best
we
go
over
and
see
him
directly
after
breakfast
if
you
like
by
all
means
now
i
think
i
go
and
take
a
little
nap
i
feel
quite
worn
out
when
the
inspector
arrives
you
will
be
able
to
explain
all
that
has
happened
but
i
think
i
should
ask
him
to
keep
a
quiet
tongue
in
his
head
about
the
island
if
it
leaks
out
at
all
it
may
warn
them
and
they
be
off
elsewhere
to
a
place
perhaps
where
we
may
not
be
able
to
find
them
i
remember
said
wetherell
and
thereupon
i
retired
to
my
room
and
having
partially
undressed
threw
myself
upon
my
bed
in
less
than
two
minutes
i
was
fast
asleep
never
waking
until
the
first
gong
sounded
for
breakfast
then
after
a
good
bath
which
refreshed
me
wonderfully
i
dressed
in
my
usual
habiliments
and
went
downstairs
wetherell
and
the
marquis
were
in
the
and
when
i
entered
both
he
and
the
marquis
who
held
a
copy
of
the
morning
in
his
hand
seemed
prodigiously
excited
i
say
hatteras
said
the
latter
after
i
had
said
here
an
advertisement
which
is
evidently
intended
for
you
what
is
it
about
i
asked
who
wants
to
advertise
for
me
read
for
yourself
said
the
marquis
giving
me
the
paper
i
took
it
and
glanced
down
the
column
to
which
he
referred
me
until
i
came
to
the
following
richard
if
this
should
meet
the
eye
of
richard
hatteras
of
thursday
island
torres
straits
lately
returned
from
england
and
believed
to
be
now
in
sydney
he
is
earnestly
requested
to
call
at
the
office
of
dawson
gladman
solicitors
castlereagh
street
where
he
will
hear
of
something
to
his
advantage
there
could
be
no
doubt
at
all
that
i
was
the
person
referred
to
but
what
could
be
the
reason
of
it
all
what
was
there
that
i
could
possibly
hear
to
my
advantage
save
news
of
phyllis
and
it
would
be
most
unlikely
that
i
would
learn
anything
about
the
movements
of
the
gang
who
had
abducted
her
from
a
firm
of
solicitors
such
as
i
understood
dawson
gladman
to
be
however
it
was
no
use
wondering
about
it
so
i
dismissed
the
matter
from
my
mind
for
the
present
and
took
my
place
at
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
the
butler
left
the
room
in
response
to
a
ring
at
the
front
door
when
he
returned
it
was
to
inform
me
that
a
man
was
in
the
hall
who
wished
to
have
a
few
moments
conversation
with
me
asking
wetherell
to
excuse
me
i
left
the
room
in
the
hall
i
found
a
individual
of
about
middle
age
he
bowed
and
on
learning
that
my
name
was
hatteras
asked
if
he
might
be
permitted
five
minutes
alone
with
me
in
response
i
led
him
to
the
and
having
closed
the
door
pointed
to
a
seat
what
is
your
business
i
inquired
when
he
had
sat
down
it
is
rather
a
curious
affair
to
approach
hatteras
the
man
began
but
to
commence
may
i
be
permitted
to
suggest
that
you
are
uneasy
in
your
mind
about
a
person
who
has
disappeared
you
may
certainly
suggest
that
if
you
like
i
answered
cautiously
if
it
were
in
a
man
power
to
furnish
a
clue
regarding
that
whereabouts
it
might
be
useful
to
you
i
suppose
he
continued
craftily
watching
me
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
very
useful
i
replied
are
you
in
a
position
to
do
so
i
might
possibly
be
able
to
afford
you
some
slight
assistance
he
went
on
that
is
of
course
provided
it
were
made
worth
my
while
what
do
you
call
your
while
well
shall
we
say
five
hundred
pounds
that
not
a
large
sum
for
really
trustworthy
information
i
ought
to
ask
a
thousand
considering
the
danger
i
running
in
mixing
myself
up
with
the
affair
only
i
a
father
myself
and
that
why
i
do
it
i
see
well
let
me
tell
you
i
consider
five
hundred
too
much
well
then
i
afraid
we
ca
trade
i
sorry
so
am
i
but
i
not
going
to
buy
a
pig
in
a
poke
shall
we
say
four
hundred
then
no
nor
three
two
or
one
if
your
information
is
worth
anything
i
do
mind
giving
you
fifty
pounds
for
it
but
i
wo
give
a
halfpenny
more
as
i
spoke
i
rose
as
if
to
terminate
the
interview
instantly
my
visitor
adopted
a
different
tone
my
fault
is
my
generosity
he
said
it
the
ruin
of
me
well
you
shall
have
it
for
fifty
give
me
the
money
and
i
tell
you
by
no
means
i
answered
i
must
hear
the
information
first
trust
to
my
honour
if
what
you
tell
me
is
worth
anything
i
give
you
fifty
pounds
for
it
now
what
is
it
well
sir
to
begin
with
you
must
understand
that
i
was
standing
at
the
corner
of
pitt
street
an
evening
or
two
back
when
two
men
passed
me
talking
earnestly
together
one
of
was
a
tall
strapping
fellow
the
other
a
little
chap
i
never
saw
two
eviller
looking
rascals
in
my
life
just
as
they
came
alongside
me
one
says
to
the
other
be
afraid
i
have
the
girl
at
the
station
all
right
at
eight
sharp
the
other
said
something
that
i
could
not
catch
and
then
i
lost
sight
of
them
but
what
i
had
heard
stuck
in
my
head
and
so
i
accordingly
went
off
to
the
station
arriving
there
a
little
before
the
hour
i
been
there
long
before
the
smallest
of
the
two
chaps
i
seen
in
the
street
came
on
to
the
platform
and
began
looking
about
him
by
the
face
of
him
he
did
seem
at
all
pleased
at
not
finding
the
other
man
waiting
for
him
a
train
drew
up
at
the
platform
and
presently
just
before
it
started
i
saw
the
other
and
a
young
lady
wearing
a
heavy
veil
come
quickly
along
the
first
man
saw
them
and
gave
a
little
cry
of
delight
thought
you
be
too
late
says
he
fear
of
that
says
the
other
and
jumps
into
a
carriage
telling
the
girl
to
get
in
after
him
which
she
does
crying
the
while
as
i
could
see
then
the
chap
on
the
platform
says
to
the
other
who
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
to
me
from
bourke
and
tell
me
how
she
gets
on
bet
says
his
friend
do
you
forget
to
keep
your
eye
on
hatteras
you
be
afraid
answered
the
man
on
the
platform
then
the
guard
whistled
and
the
train
went
out
of
the
station
directly
i
was
able
to
i
got
away
and
first
thing
this
morning
came
on
here
now
you
have
my
information
and
i
trouble
you
for
that
fifty
pound
not
so
fast
my
friend
your
story
seems
very
good
but
i
want
to
ask
a
few
questions
first
had
the
bigger
man
the
man
who
went
up
to
bourke
a
deep
cut
over
his
left
eye
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
he
had
i
forgotten
to
tell
you
that
so
it
was
he
then
but
are
you
certain
it
was
miss
wetherell
remember
she
wore
a
veil
could
you
see
if
her
hair
was
flaxen
in
colour
very
light
it
was
but
i
could
see
rightly
which
colour
it
was
you
sure
it
was
a
light
colour
quite
sure
i
could
swear
to
it
in
a
court
of
law
if
you
wanted
me
to
that
all
right
then
because
it
shows
me
your
story
is
a
fabrication
come
get
out
of
this
house
or
i
throw
you
out
you
scoundrel
for
two
pins
i
give
you
such
a
thrashing
as
you
remember
all
your
life
none
o
that
governor
do
you
try
it
on
hand
us
over
that
fifty
quid
with
that
the
scoundrel
whipped
out
a
revolver
and
pointed
it
at
me
but
before
he
could
threaten
again
i
had
got
hold
of
his
wrist
with
one
hand
snatched
the
pistol
with
the
other
and
sent
him
sprawling
on
his
back
upon
the
carpet
now
you
brute
i
cried
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
you
do
you
think
get
up
and
clear
out
of
the
house
before
i
take
my
boot
to
you
he
got
up
and
began
to
brush
his
clothes
i
want
my
fifty
pound
he
cried
you
get
more
than
you
want
if
you
come
here
again
i
said
out
you
go
with
that
i
got
him
by
the
collar
and
dragged
him
out
of
the
room
across
the
hall
much
to
the
butler
astonishment
through
the
front
door
and
then
kicked
him
down
the
steps
he
fell
in
a
heap
on
the
gravel
all
right
my
fine
bloke
he
said
as
he
lay
there
you
wait
till
i
get
you
outside
i
fix
you
up
and
do
you
make
no
mistake
i
went
back
to
the
without
paying
any
attention
to
his
threats
both
wetherell
and
beckenham
had
been
witnesses
of
what
had
occurred
and
now
they
questioned
me
concerning
his
visit
i
gave
them
an
outline
of
the
story
the
man
had
told
me
and
convinced
them
of
its
absurdity
then
wetherell
rose
to
his
feet
now
shall
we
go
and
see
mcmurtough
certainly
i
said
i
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
you
will
come
with
us
i
hope
lord
beckenham
wetherell
said
with
every
pleasure
answered
his
lordship
and
thereupon
we
went
off
to
get
ready
of
an
hour
later
we
were
sitting
in
office
the
upshot
of
the
interview
was
that
mcmurtough
fell
in
with
our
plans
as
soon
as
we
had
uttered
them
and
expressed
himself
delighted
to
lend
his
yacht
in
such
a
good
cause
i
only
wish
i
could
come
with
you
he
said
but
unfortunately
that
is
quite
impossible
however
you
are
more
than
welcome
to
my
boat
i
will
give
you
a
letter
or
send
one
to
the
captain
so
that
she
may
be
prepared
for
sea
will
you
see
about
provisioning
her
or
shall
i
we
will
attend
to
that
said
wetherell
all
the
expenses
must
of
course
be
mine
as
you
please
about
that
my
old
friend
returned
mcmurtough
where
is
she
lying
asked
wetherell
the
owner
gave
us
the
direction
and
then
having
sincerely
thanked
him
we
set
off
in
search
of
her
she
was
a
nice
craft
of
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
tons
burden
and
looked
as
if
she
ought
to
be
a
good
sea
boat
chartering
a
wherry
we
were
pulled
off
to
her
the
captain
was
below
when
we
arrived
but
a
hail
brought
him
on
deck
wetherell
then
explained
our
errand
and
gave
him
his
owner
letter
he
read
it
through
and
having
done
so
said
i
am
at
your
service
gentlemen
from
what
mcmurtough
says
here
i
gather
that
there
is
no
time
to
lose
so
with
your
permission
i
get
to
work
at
once
order
all
the
coal
you
want
and
tell
the
steward
to
do
the
same
for
anything
he
may
require
in
his
department
the
bills
must
be
sent
in
to
me
very
good
wetherell
and
what
time
will
you
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
are
can
you
get
away
by
three
this
afternoon
think
you
well
it
will
be
a
bit
of
a
scramble
but
i
think
we
can
manage
it
anyhow
i
do
my
best
you
may
be
sure
of
that
sir
i
sure
you
will
there
is
grave
need
for
it
now
we
go
back
and
arrange
a
few
matters
ashore
my
man
shall
bring
our
baggage
down
later
on
very
good
sir
i
have
your
berths
prepared
with
that
we
descended
to
the
boat
again
and
were
pulled
ashore
arriving
there
wetherell
asked
what
we
should
do
first
had
we
better
go
up
to
the
town
and
purchase
a
few
rifles
and
some
ammunition
i
said
we
can
have
them
sent
down
direct
to
the
boat
a
very
good
suggestion
let
us
go
at
once
we
accordingly
set
off
for
george
street
to
a
shop
i
remembered
having
seen
there
we
purchased
half
a
dozen
winchester
repeaters
with
a
good
supply
of
ammunition
they
were
to
be
sent
down
to
the
yacht
without
fail
that
morning
this
done
we
stood
on
the
pavement
debating
what
we
should
do
next
finally
it
was
decided
that
wetherell
and
beckenham
should
go
home
to
pack
while
i
made
one
or
two
other
small
purchases
and
then
join
them
accordingly
bidding
them
i
went
on
down
the
street
completed
my
business
and
was
about
to
hail
a
cab
and
follow
them
when
a
thought
struck
me
why
should
i
not
visit
dawson
gladman
and
find
out
why
they
were
advertising
for
me
this
i
determined
to
do
and
accordingly
set
off
for
castlereagh
street
in
a
small
room
leading
off
the
main
passage
three
clerks
were
seated
to
them
i
addressed
myself
asking
if
i
might
see
the
partners
dawson
is
the
only
one
in
town
sir
said
the
boy
to
whom
i
spoke
if
you
give
me
your
name
i
take
it
in
to
him
my
name
is
hatteras
i
said
richard
hatteras
in
less
than
two
minutes
the
clerk
returned
and
begged
me
to
follow
him
which
i
did
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
we
passed
through
a
curtained
doorway
and
i
stood
in
the
presence
of
the
chief
partner
i
have
great
pleasure
in
making
your
acquaintance
hatteras
he
said
as
i
came
to
an
anchor
in
a
chair
you
noticed
our
advertisement
i
presume
i
saw
it
this
morning
i
answered
and
it
is
on
that
account
i
am
here
one
moment
before
we
proceed
any
further
forgive
what
i
am
about
to
say
but
you
will
see
yourself
that
it
is
a
point
i
am
compelled
not
to
neglect
can
you
convince
me
as
to
your
identity
very
easily
i
replied
diving
my
hand
into
my
and
taking
out
some
papers
first
and
foremost
here
is
my
here
is
my
and
here
are
two
or
three
letters
addressed
to
me
by
london
and
sydney
firms
the
hon
sylvester
wetherell
colonial
secretary
will
be
glad
i
sure
to
vouch
for
me
is
that
sufficient
to
convince
you
more
than
sufficient
he
answered
smiling
now
let
me
tell
you
for
what
purpose
we
desired
you
to
call
upon
us
here
he
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
letter
first
and
foremost
you
must
understand
that
we
are
the
sydney
agents
of
messrs
atwin
dobbs
forsyth
of
inn
london
from
them
by
the
last
english
mail
we
received
this
letter
i
gather
that
you
are
the
son
of
james
dymoke
hatteras
who
was
drowned
at
sea
in
the
year
i
am
your
father
was
the
third
son
of
sir
edward
hatteras
of
murdlestone
in
the
county
of
hampshire
he
was
and
the
brother
of
sir
william
who
had
one
daughter
gwendoline
mary
that
is
so
well
hatteras
it
is
my
sad
duty
to
inform
you
that
within
a
week
of
your
departure
from
england
your
cousin
the
young
lady
just
referred
to
was
drowned
by
accident
in
a
pond
near
her
home
and
that
her
father
who
had
been
ailing
for
some
few
days
died
of
heart
disease
on
hearing
the
sad
tidings
in
that
case
so
my
correspondents
inform
me
there
being
no
nearer
issue
you
succeed
to
the
title
and
estates
which
i
also
learn
are
of
considerable
value
including
the
house
and
park
ten
farms
and
a
large
amount
of
house
property
a
rent
roll
of
fifteen
thousand
a
year
and
accumulated
capital
of
nearly
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
good
gracious
is
this
really
true
quite
true
you
can
examine
the
letter
for
yourself
i
took
it
up
from
the
table
and
read
it
through
hardly
able
to
believe
my
eyes
you
are
indeed
a
man
to
be
envied
hatteras
said
the
lawyer
the
title
is
an
old
one
and
i
believe
the
property
is
considered
one
of
the
best
in
that
part
of
england
it
is
but
i
can
hardly
believe
that
it
is
really
mine
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
however
you
are
a
baronet
as
certainly
as
i
am
a
lawyer
i
presume
you
would
like
us
to
take
whatever
action
is
necessary
by
all
means
this
afternoon
i
am
leaving
sydney
for
a
week
or
two
for
the
islands
i
will
sign
any
papers
when
i
come
back
i
will
bear
that
in
mind
and
your
address
in
sydney
is
care
of
the
honourable
sylvester
wetherell
potts
point
thank
you
and
by
the
way
my
correspondents
have
desired
me
on
their
behalf
to
pay
in
to
your
account
at
the
oceania
the
sum
of
five
thousand
pounds
this
i
will
do
i
am
obliged
to
you
now
i
think
i
must
be
going
to
tell
the
truth
i
hardly
know
whether
i
am
standing
on
my
head
or
my
heels
oh
you
will
soon
get
over
that
sir
richard
with
that
i
bade
him
farewell
and
went
out
of
the
office
feeling
quite
dazed
by
my
good
fortune
i
thought
of
the
poor
idiot
whose
end
had
been
so
tragic
and
of
the
old
man
as
i
had
last
seen
him
shaking
his
fist
at
me
from
the
window
of
the
house
and
to
think
that
that
lovely
home
was
mine
and
that
i
was
a
baronet
the
principal
representative
of
a
race
as
old
as
any
in
the
it
seemed
too
wonderful
to
be
true
hearty
were
the
congratulations
showered
upon
me
at
potts
point
you
may
be
sure
when
i
told
my
tale
and
my
health
was
drunk
at
lunch
with
much
goodwill
but
our
minds
were
too
much
taken
up
with
the
arrangements
for
our
departure
that
afternoon
to
allow
us
to
think
very
much
of
anything
else
by
two
we
were
ready
to
leave
the
house
by
we
were
on
board
the
yacht
at
the
anchor
was
up
and
a
few
moments
later
we
were
ploughing
our
way
down
the
harbour
our
search
for
phyllis
had
reached
another
stage
chapter
v
the
islands
and
what
we
found
there
to
those
who
have
had
no
experience
of
the
south
pacific
the
constantly
recurring
beauties
of
our
voyage
would
have
seemed
like
a
foretaste
of
heaven
itself
from
sydney
until
the
loyalty
group
lay
behind
us
we
had
one
long
spell
of
exquisite
weather
by
night
under
the
winking
stars
and
by
day
in
the
warm
sunlight
our
trim
little
craft
ploughed
her
way
across
smooth
seas
and
our
only
occupation
was
to
promenade
or
loaf
about
the
decks
and
to
speculate
as
to
the
result
of
the
expedition
upon
which
we
had
embarked
having
sighted
the
isle
of
pines
we
turned
our
bows
almost
due
north
and
headed
for
the
new
hebrides
every
hour
our
impatience
was
growing
greater
in
less
than
two
days
all
being
well
we
should
be
at
our
destination
and
hours
after
that
if
our
fortune
proved
in
the
ascendant
we
ought
to
be
on
our
way
back
with
phyllis
in
our
possession
once
more
and
what
this
would
mean
to
me
i
can
only
leave
you
to
guess
one
morning
just
as
the
faint
outline
of
the
coast
of
aneityum
was
peering
up
over
the
horizon
ahead
wetherell
and
i
chanced
to
be
sitting
in
the
bows
the
sea
was
as
smooth
as
glass
and
the
tinkling
of
the
water
round
the
little
vessel
nose
as
she
turned
it
off
in
snowy
lines
from
either
bow
was
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
as
usual
the
conversation
after
wandering
into
other
topics
came
back
to
the
subject
nearest
our
hearts
this
led
us
to
make
a
few
remarks
anent
nikola
and
his
character
i
could
not
help
asking
him
for
an
explanation
you
want
to
know
how
it
is
that
i
am
so
frightened
of
nikola
he
asked
well
to
give
you
my
reason
will
necessitate
my
telling
you
a
story
i
do
mind
doing
that
at
all
but
what
i
am
afraid
of
is
that
you
may
be
inclined
to
doubt
its
probability
however
if
you
want
to
hear
it
you
shall
i
should
like
to
above
all
things
i
replied
i
have
been
longing
to
ask
you
about
it
for
some
time
past
but
could
not
quite
screw
up
my
courage
well
in
the
first
place
wetherell
said
you
must
understand
that
before
i
became
a
minister
of
the
crown
or
indeed
a
member
of
parliament
at
all
i
was
a
barrister
with
a
fairly
remunerative
practice
that
was
before
my
wife
death
and
when
phyllis
was
at
school
up
to
the
time
i
am
going
to
tell
you
about
i
had
taken
part
in
no
very
sensational
case
but
my
opportunity
for
earning
notoriety
was
though
i
did
not
know
it
near
at
hand
one
day
i
was
briefed
to
defend
a
man
accused
of
the
murder
of
a
chinaman
aboard
a
sydney
vessel
on
a
voyage
from
shanghai
at
first
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
at
all
as
to
his
guilt
but
by
a
singular
chance
with
the
details
of
which
i
will
not
bore
you
i
hit
upon
a
scheme
which
got
him
off
i
remember
the
man
perfectly
and
a
queer
fellow
he
was
i
thought
and
at
the
time
of
the
trial
within
an
ace
of
dying
of
consumption
his
gratitude
was
the
more
pathetic
because
he
had
not
the
wherewithal
to
pay
me
however
he
made
it
up
to
me
in
another
way
one
wet
night
a
couple
of
months
or
so
after
the
trial
i
was
sitting
in
my
listening
to
my
wife
music
when
a
servant
entered
to
tell
me
that
a
woman
wanted
to
see
me
i
went
out
into
the
passage
to
find
waiting
there
a
tall
buxom
lass
of
about
years
of
age
she
was
poorly
dressed
but
in
a
great
state
of
excitement
you
mr
wetherell
she
said
gentleman
as
defended
china
pete
in
the
trial
the
other
day
am
i
answered
can
i
do
for
you
i
hope
china
pete
is
not
in
trouble
again
in
a
worse
trouble
this
time
sir
said
the
woman
dyin
and
he
sent
me
to
fetch
you
to
before
he
goes
what
does
he
want
me
for
i
asked
rather
suspiciously
sure
i
dunno
was
the
girl
reply
he
been
callin
for
you
all
this
blessed
day
send
for
wetherell
send
for
mr
wetherell
so
off
i
came
when
i
got
back
from
work
to
fetch
you
if
you
comin
sir
you
best
be
quick
for
he
wo
last
till
mornin
well
i
come
with
you
at
once
i
said
then
having
told
my
wife
not
to
sit
up
for
me
i
followed
my
strange
messenger
out
of
the
house
for
nearly
an
hour
we
walked
on
and
on
plunging
deeper
into
the
lower
quarter
of
the
town
all
through
the
march
my
guide
maintained
a
rigid
silence
walking
a
few
paces
ahead
and
only
recognizing
the
fact
that
i
was
following
her
by
nodding
in
a
certain
direction
whenever
we
arrived
at
cross
thoroughfares
or
interlacing
lanes
at
last
we
arrived
at
the
street
she
wanted
at
the
corner
she
came
suddenly
to
a
standstill
and
putting
her
two
first
fingers
into
her
mouth
blew
a
shrill
whistle
after
the
fashion
of
street
boys
a
moment
later
a
urchin
about
ten
years
old
made
his
appearance
from
a
dark
alley
and
came
towards
us
the
woman
said
something
to
him
which
i
did
not
catch
and
then
turning
sharply
to
her
left
hand
beckoned
to
me
to
follow
her
from
the
street
itself
we
passed
by
way
of
a
villainous
alley
into
a
large
courtyard
where
brooded
a
silence
like
that
of
death
indeed
a
more
weird
and
desolate
place
i
do
remember
ever
to
have
met
with
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
and
though
it
was
surrounded
by
houses
only
two
feeble
lights
showed
themselves
towards
one
of
these
my
guide
made
her
way
stopping
on
the
threshold
upon
a
panel
she
rapped
with
her
fingers
and
as
she
did
so
a
window
on
the
first
floor
opened
and
the
boy
we
had
met
in
the
street
looked
out
many
inquired
the
woman
who
had
brought
me
in
a
loud
whisper
now
replied
the
boy
there
been
a
power
of
chinkies
hereabouts
all
the
evenin
an
an
hour
ago
there
was
a
gent
in
a
cloak
without
waiting
to
hear
any
more
the
woman
entered
the
house
and
i
followed
close
on
her
heels
the
adventure
was
clearly
coming
to
a
head
now
when
the
door
had
been
closed
behind
us
the
boy
appeared
at
the
top
of
a
flight
of
stairs
with
a
lighted
candle
we
accordingly
ascended
to
him
and
having
done
so
made
our
way
towards
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
abominably
dirty
landing
at
intervals
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
coughing
coming
from
a
room
at
the
end
my
companion
however
bade
me
stop
while
she
went
herself
into
the
room
shutting
the
door
after
her
i
was
left
alone
with
the
boy
who
immediately
took
me
under
his
protection
and
for
my
undivided
benefit
performed
a
series
of
highly
meritorious
acrobatic
performances
upon
the
feeble
banisters
to
his
own
danger
but
apparent
satisfaction
suddenly
just
as
he
was
about
to
commence
what
promised
to
be
the
most
successful
item
in
his
he
paused
lay
flat
on
his
stomach
upon
the
floor
and
craned
his
head
over
the
side
where
once
banisters
had
been
and
gazed
into
the
half
dark
well
below
all
was
quiet
as
the
grave
then
without
warning
an
pigtailed
head
appeared
on
the
stairs
and
looked
upwards
before
i
could
say
anything
to
stop
him
the
youth
had
divested
himself
of
his
one
slipper
taken
it
in
his
right
hand
leaned
over
a
bit
farther
and
struck
the
ascending
celestial
a
severe
blow
on
the
mouth
with
the
heel
of
it
there
was
the
noise
of
a
hasty
descent
and
the
banging
of
the
street
door
a
moment
later
then
all
was
still
again
and
the
youngster
turned
to
me
was
ah
chong
he
said
confidentially
the
sixth
chinkie
i
landed
that
way
since
dark
this
important
piece
of
information
he
closed
with
a
oath
of
remarkable
atrocity
and
having
done
so
would
have
recommenced
the
performance
of
acrobatic
feats
had
i
not
stopped
him
by
asking
the
reason
of
his
action
he
looked
at
me
with
a
grin
dunno
but
all
i
cares
is
that
china
pete
in
there
gives
me
a
sprat
sixpence
for
every
chinkie
what
i
keeps
out
of
the
he
a
rum
one
is
china
pete
an
ca
he
cough
my
word
he
concluded
i
was
about
to
put
another
question
when
the
door
opened
and
the
girl
who
had
brought
me
to
the
house
beckoned
me
into
the
room
i
entered
and
she
left
me
alone
with
the
occupant
of
all
the
filthy
places
i
have
ever
seen
and
i
have
had
the
to
discover
a
good
many
in
my
time
that
one
eclipsed
them
all
on
the
bed
propped
up
by
pillows
and
evidently
in
the
last
stage
of
collapse
was
the
man
called
china
pete
when
we
were
alone
together
he
pointed
to
a
box
near
the
bed
and
signified
that
i
should
seat
myself
i
did
so
at
the
same
time
taking
occasion
to
express
my
sorrow
at
finding
him
in
this
lamentable
condition
he
made
no
reply
to
my
civilities
but
after
a
little
pause
found
strength
enough
to
whisper
if
there
anybody
at
the
door
i
went
across
opened
the
door
and
looked
into
the
passage
but
save
the
boy
who
was
now
sitting
on
the
top
step
of
the
stairs
at
the
other
end
there
was
not
a
soul
in
sight
i
told
him
this
and
having
again
closed
the
door
sat
down
on
the
box
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
did
me
a
good
turn
wetherell
over
that
trial
the
invalid
said
at
last
i
could
make
it
worth
your
while
you
must
let
that
worry
you
i
answered
soothingly
would
have
paid
me
if
you
had
been
able
i
should
perhaps
i
should
anyhow
i
did
and
i
want
to
make
it
up
to
you
now
feel
under
my
pillow
and
bring
out
what
you
find
there
i
did
as
he
directed
me
and
brought
to
light
a
queer
little
wooden
stick
about
three
and
a
half
inches
long
made
of
some
heavy
timber
and
covered
all
over
with
chinese
inscriptions
at
one
end
was
a
tiny
bit
of
heavy
gold
cord
much
tarnished
i
gave
it
to
him
and
he
looked
at
it
fondly
you
know
the
value
of
this
little
stick
he
asked
after
a
while
have
no
possible
notion
i
replied
a
guess
he
said
to
humour
him
i
guessed
five
pounds
he
laughed
with
scorn
pounds
o
ye
gods
why
as
a
bit
of
stick
it
not
worth
five
pence
but
for
what
it
really
is
there
is
not
money
enough
in
the
world
to
purchase
it
if
i
could
get
about
again
i
would
make
myself
the
richest
and
most
powerful
man
on
earth
with
it
if
you
could
only
guess
one
particle
of
the
dangers
i
been
through
to
get
it
you
would
die
of
astonishment
and
the
irony
of
it
all
is
that
now
i
got
it
i
make
use
of
it
on
six
different
occasions
the
priests
of
the
llamaserai
in
peking
have
tried
to
murder
me
to
get
hold
of
it
i
brought
it
down
from
the
centre
of
china
disguised
as
a
wandering
beggar
that
business
connected
with
the
murder
of
the
chinaman
on
board
the
ship
against
which
you
defended
me
was
on
account
of
it
and
now
i
lie
here
dying
like
a
dog
with
the
key
to
over
ten
millions
in
my
hand
nikola
has
tried
for
five
years
to
obtain
it
without
success
however
he
little
dreams
i
got
it
after
all
if
he
did
i
be
a
dead
man
by
now
is
this
nikola
then
i
asked
nikola
well
he
nikola
and
that
all
i
can
tell
you
if
you
a
wise
man
you
want
to
know
no
more
ask
the
chinese
mothers
nursing
their
spawn
in
peking
who
he
is
ask
the
japanese
ask
the
malays
the
hindoos
the
burmese
the
coal
porters
in
port
said
the
buddhist
priests
of
ceylon
ask
the
king
of
corea
the
men
up
in
thibet
the
spanish
priests
in
manilla
or
the
sultan
of
borneo
the
ministers
of
siam
or
the
french
in
saigon
they
all
know
nikola
and
his
cat
and
take
my
word
they
fear
him
i
looked
at
the
little
stick
in
my
hand
and
wondered
if
the
man
had
gone
mad
do
you
wish
me
to
do
with
this
i
asked
it
away
with
you
he
answered
guard
it
like
your
life
and
when
you
have
occasion
use
it
remember
you
have
in
your
hand
what
will
raise
a
million
men
and
the
equivalent
of
over
ten
mil
at
this
point
a
violent
fit
of
coughing
seized
him
and
nearly
tore
him
to
pieces
i
lifted
him
up
a
little
in
the
bed
but
before
i
could
take
my
hands
away
a
stream
of
blood
had
gushed
from
his
lips
like
a
flash
of
thought
i
ran
to
the
door
to
call
the
girl
the
boy
on
the
stairs
my
shout
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
the
woman
was
in
the
room
but
we
were
too
late
pete
was
after
giving
her
all
the
money
i
had
about
me
to
pay
for
the
funeral
i
bade
her
and
with
the
little
stick
in
my
pocket
returned
to
my
home
once
there
i
sat
myself
down
in
my
study
took
my
legacy
out
of
my
pocket
and
carefully
examined
it
as
to
its
peculiar
power
and
value
as
described
to
me
by
the
dead
man
i
hardly
knew
what
to
think
my
own
private
opinion
was
that
china
pete
was
not
sane
at
the
time
he
told
me
and
yet
how
was
i
to
account
for
the
affray
with
the
chinaman
on
the
boat
and
the
evident
desire
the
celestials
in
sydney
had
to
obtain
information
concerning
it
after
half
an
hour
consideration
of
it
i
locked
it
up
in
a
drawer
of
my
safe
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
next
day
china
pete
was
buried
and
by
the
end
of
the
month
i
had
forgotten
that
he
had
ever
existed
and
had
hardly
thought
of
his
queer
little
gift
which
still
reposed
in
the
upper
drawer
of
my
safe
but
i
was
to
hear
more
of
it
later
on
one
night
about
a
month
after
my
coming
into
possession
of
the
stick
my
wife
and
i
entertained
a
few
friends
at
dinner
as
the
clock
struck
eleven
i
said
to
the
last
of
my
guests
upon
the
the
carriage
had
not
gone
fifty
yards
down
the
street
before
a
hansom
drew
up
before
my
door
and
a
man
dressed
in
a
heavy
cloak
jumped
out
bidding
the
driver
wait
for
him
he
ran
up
my
steps
wetherell
i
believe
he
said
i
nodded
and
wished
him
at
the
same
time
asking
his
business
will
tell
you
with
pleasure
he
answered
you
will
permit
me
five
minutes
alone
with
you
it
is
most
important
and
as
i
leave
sydney
early
morning
you
will
see
that
there
is
not
much
time
to
spare
i
led
the
way
into
the
house
and
to
my
study
which
was
in
the
rear
overlooking
the
garden
once
there
i
bade
him
be
seated
taking
up
my
position
at
my
desk
then
in
the
light
of
the
lamp
i
became
aware
of
the
extraordinary
personality
of
my
visitor
he
looked
at
me
very
searchingly
for
a
moment
and
then
said
business
will
surprise
you
a
little
i
expect
wetherell
first
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
tell
you
something
about
myself
and
then
ask
you
a
question
you
must
understand
that
i
am
pretty
well
known
as
an
eastern
traveller
from
port
said
to
the
kuriles
there
is
hardly
a
place
with
which
i
am
not
acquainted
i
have
a
hobby
i
am
a
collector
of
eastern
curios
but
there
is
one
thing
i
have
never
been
able
to
obtain
that
is
chinese
executioner
symbol
of
office
how
can
i
help
you
in
that
direction
i
asked
completely
mystified
selling
me
one
that
has
lately
come
into
your
possession
he
said
is
a
little
black
stick
about
three
inches
long
and
covered
with
chinese
characters
i
happened
to
hear
quite
by
chance
that
you
had
one
in
your
possession
and
i
have
taken
a
journey
of
some
thousands
of
miles
to
endeavour
to
purchase
it
from
you
i
went
across
to
the
safe
unlocked
it
and
took
out
the
little
stick
china
pete
had
given
me
when
i
turned
round
i
almost
dropped
it
with
surprise
as
i
saw
the
look
of
eagerness
that
rose
in
my
visitor
face
but
he
pulled
himself
together
and
said
as
calmly
as
he
had
yet
addressed
me
is
the
very
thing
if
you
will
allow
me
to
purchase
it
it
will
complete
my
collection
what
value
do
you
place
upon
it
have
no
sort
of
notion
of
its
worth
i
answered
putting
it
down
on
the
table
and
looking
at
it
then
in
a
flash
a
thought
came
into
my
brain
and
i
was
about
to
speak
when
he
addressed
me
again
course
my
reason
for
wishing
to
buy
it
is
rather
a
one
but
if
you
care
to
let
me
have
it
i
will
give
you
fifty
pounds
for
it
with
pleasure
enough
nikola
i
said
with
a
smile
he
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
and
then
clasped
his
hands
tight
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
my
random
bolt
had
gone
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
this
man
then
nikola
the
extraordinary
individual
against
whom
china
pete
had
warned
me
i
was
determined
now
that
come
what
might
he
should
not
have
the
stick
you
not
consider
the
offer
i
make
you
a
good
one
then
mr
wetherell
he
asked
sorry
to
say
i
do
think
the
stick
is
for
sale
i
answered
was
left
to
me
by
a
man
in
return
for
a
queer
sort
of
service
i
rendered
him
and
i
think
i
should
like
to
keep
it
as
a
souvenir
will
raise
my
offer
to
a
hundred
pounds
in
that
case
said
nikola
would
rather
not
part
with
it
i
said
and
as
i
spoke
as
if
to
clinch
the
matter
i
took
it
up
and
returned
it
to
the
safe
taking
care
to
lock
the
door
upon
it
will
give
you
five
hundred
pounds
for
it
cried
nikola
now
thoroughly
excited
that
will
tempt
you
afraid
an
offer
of
ten
times
that
amount
would
make
no
difference
i
replied
feeling
more
convinced
than
ever
that
i
would
not
part
with
it
he
laid
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
for
nearly
a
minute
and
a
half
stared
me
full
in
the
face
you
have
seen
nikola
eyes
so
i
tell
you
what
a
queer
effect
they
are
able
to
produce
i
could
not
withdraw
mine
from
them
and
i
felt
that
if
i
did
not
make
an
effort
i
should
soon
be
mesmerized
so
pulling
myself
together
i
sprang
from
my
chair
and
by
doing
so
let
him
see
that
our
interview
was
at
an
end
however
he
was
not
going
without
a
last
attempt
to
drive
a
bargain
when
he
saw
that
i
was
not
to
be
moved
his
temper
gave
way
and
he
bluntly
told
me
that
i
would
to
sell
it
is
no
compulsion
in
the
matter
i
said
warmly
curio
is
my
own
property
and
i
will
do
just
as
i
please
with
it
he
thereupon
begged
my
pardon
asked
me
to
attribute
his
impatience
to
the
collector
eagerness
and
after
a
few
last
words
bade
me
and
left
the
house
when
his
cab
had
rolled
away
i
went
back
to
my
study
and
sat
thinking
for
awhile
then
something
prompted
me
to
take
the
stick
out
from
the
safe
i
did
so
and
sat
at
my
table
gazing
at
it
wondering
what
the
mystery
might
be
to
which
it
was
the
key
that
it
was
not
what
nikola
had
described
it
i
felt
certain
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
intending
to
take
it
upstairs
to
show
my
wife
locked
the
safe
again
and
went
off
to
my
when
i
had
described
the
interview
and
shown
the
stick
to
my
wife
i
placed
it
in
the
drawer
of
the
and
went
to
bed
next
morning
about
three
i
was
awakened
by
the
sound
of
some
one
knocking
violently
at
my
door
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
inquired
who
it
might
be
to
my
intense
surprise
the
answer
was
i
therefore
donned
my
and
went
out
to
find
a
sergeant
of
police
on
the
landing
waiting
for
me
is
the
matter
i
cried
burglar
was
his
answer
got
him
downstairs
caught
him
in
the
act
i
followed
the
officer
down
to
the
study
what
a
scene
was
there
the
safe
had
been
forced
and
its
contents
lay
scattered
in
every
direction
one
drawer
of
my
was
wide
open
and
in
a
corner
handcuffed
and
guarded
by
a
stalwart
constable
stood
a
chinaman
well
to
make
a
long
story
short
the
man
was
tried
and
after
denying
all
knowledge
of
nikola
who
by
the
way
could
not
be
found
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
five
years
hard
labour
for
a
month
i
heard
no
more
about
the
curio
then
a
letter
arrived
from
an
english
solicitor
in
shanghai
demanding
from
me
on
behalf
of
a
chinaman
residing
in
that
place
a
little
wooden
stick
covered
with
chinese
characters
which
was
said
to
have
been
stolen
by
an
englishman
known
in
shanghai
as
china
pete
this
was
very
clearly
another
attempt
on
nikola
part
to
obtain
possession
of
it
so
i
replied
to
the
effect
that
i
could
not
entertain
the
request
a
month
or
so
later
i
can
not
however
be
particular
as
to
the
exact
date
i
found
myself
again
in
communication
with
nikola
this
time
from
south
america
but
there
was
this
difference
this
time
he
used
undisguised
threats
not
only
against
myself
in
the
event
of
my
still
refusing
to
give
him
what
he
wanted
but
also
against
my
wife
and
daughter
i
took
no
notice
with
the
result
that
my
residence
was
again
broken
into
but
still
without
success
now
i
no
longer
locked
the
talisman
up
in
the
safe
but
hid
it
in
a
place
where
i
knew
no
one
could
possibly
find
it
my
mind
you
will
see
was
perfectly
made
up
i
was
not
going
to
be
driven
into
surrendering
it
one
night
a
month
after
my
wife
death
returning
to
my
house
i
was
garrotted
and
searched
within
a
hundred
yards
of
my
own
front
door
but
my
assailants
could
not
find
it
on
me
then
peculiar
pressure
from
other
quarters
was
brought
to
bear
my
servants
were
bribed
and
my
life
became
almost
a
burden
to
me
what
was
more
i
began
to
develop
that
extraordinary
fear
of
nikola
which
seems
to
seize
upon
every
one
who
has
any
dealings
with
him
when
i
went
home
to
england
some
months
back
i
did
it
because
my
spirits
had
got
into
such
a
depressed
state
that
i
could
not
remain
in
australia
but
i
took
care
to
deposit
the
stick
with
my
plate
in
the
bank
before
i
left
there
it
remained
till
i
returned
when
i
put
it
back
in
its
old
again
the
day
after
i
reached
london
i
happened
to
be
crossing
trafalgar
square
believing
that
i
had
left
him
at
least
ten
thousand
miles
away
you
may
imagine
my
horror
when
i
saw
nikola
watching
me
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
then
and
there
i
returned
to
my
hotel
bade
phyllis
pack
with
all
possible
despatch
and
that
same
afternoon
we
started
to
return
to
australia
the
rest
you
know
now
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
it
an
extraordinary
story
where
is
the
stick
at
the
present
moment
in
my
pocket
would
you
like
to
see
it
very
much
if
you
would
permit
me
to
do
so
he
unbuttoned
his
coat
and
from
a
carefully
contrived
pocket
under
the
arm
drew
out
a
little
piece
of
wood
of
exactly
the
length
and
shape
he
had
described
i
took
it
from
him
and
gazed
at
it
carefully
it
was
covered
all
over
with
chinese
writing
and
had
a
piece
of
gold
silk
attached
to
the
handle
there
was
nothing
very
remarkable
about
it
but
i
must
own
i
was
strangely
fascinated
by
it
when
i
remembered
the
misery
it
had
caused
the
changes
and
chances
it
had
brought
about
the
weird
story
told
by
china
pete
and
the
efforts
that
had
been
made
by
nikola
to
obtain
possession
of
it
i
gave
it
back
to
its
owner
and
then
stood
looking
out
over
the
smooth
sea
wondering
where
phyllis
was
and
what
she
was
doing
nikola
when
i
met
him
would
have
a
heavy
account
to
settle
with
me
and
if
my
darling
reported
any
further
cruelty
on
his
part
i
would
show
no
mercy
but
why
had
wetherell
brought
the
curio
with
him
now
i
put
the
question
for
one
very
good
reason
he
answered
if
it
is
the
stick
nikola
is
after
as
i
have
every
right
to
suppose
he
may
demand
it
as
a
ransom
for
my
girl
and
i
am
quite
willing
to
let
him
have
it
the
wretched
thing
has
caused
sufficient
misery
to
make
me
only
too
glad
to
be
rid
of
it
i
hope
however
we
shall
be
able
to
get
her
without
giving
it
up
i
said
now
let
us
go
aft
to
lunch
the
day
following
we
were
within
a
hundred
miles
of
our
destination
and
by
of
the
day
following
that
again
were
near
enough
to
render
it
advisable
to
hold
a
council
over
our
intended
movements
accordingly
a
little
before
lunch
time
the
marquis
wetherell
the
skipper
and
myself
met
under
the
after
awning
to
consider
our
plan
of
war
the
first
matter
to
be
taken
into
consideration
i
think
wetherell
said
the
skipper
is
the
point
as
to
which
side
of
the
island
we
shall
bring
up
on
you
will
be
able
to
settle
that
answered
wetherell
looking
at
me
you
are
acquainted
with
the
place
and
can
best
advise
us
i
will
do
so
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
said
sitting
down
on
the
deck
and
drawing
an
outline
with
a
piece
of
chalk
the
island
is
shaped
like
this
there
is
no
reef
here
is
the
best
anchorage
without
doubt
but
here
is
the
point
where
we
shall
be
most
likely
to
approach
without
being
observed
the
trend
of
the
land
is
all
upward
from
the
shore
and
as
far
as
i
remember
the
most
likely
spot
for
a
hut
if
they
are
detaining
miss
wetherell
there
as
we
suppose
will
be
on
a
little
plateau
looking
south
and
hard
by
the
only
water
on
the
island
and
what
sort
of
anchorage
shall
we
get
there
do
you
think
asked
the
skipper
who
very
properly
wished
to
run
no
risk
with
his
owner
boat
mostly
coral
none
too
good
perhaps
but
as
we
shall
have
steam
up
quite
safe
enough
and
how
do
you
propose
that
we
shall
reach
the
hut
when
we
land
i
have
been
thinking
that
out
i
said
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
plan
would
be
for
us
to
approach
the
island
after
dark
to
heave
to
about
three
miles
out
and
pull
ashore
in
the
boat
we
will
then
ascend
the
hill
by
the
eastern
slope
and
descend
upon
them
they
will
probably
not
expect
us
from
that
quarter
and
it
will
at
least
be
easier
than
climbing
the
hill
in
the
face
of
a
heavy
fire
what
do
you
say
they
all
agreed
that
it
seemed
practicable
very
good
then
said
the
skipper
we
have
lunch
and
afterwards
begin
our
preparations
then
turning
to
me
i
get
you
to
come
into
my
cabin
hatteras
and
take
a
look
at
the
admiralty
chart
if
you
will
you
will
be
able
probably
to
tell
me
if
you
think
it
can
be
relied
on
i
do
so
with
pleasure
i
answered
and
then
we
went
below
directly
our
meal
was
over
i
accompanied
the
skipper
to
look
at
the
chart
and
upon
it
we
marked
our
anchorage
then
an
adjournment
was
made
aft
and
our
equipment
of
rifles
and
revolvers
thoroughly
overhauled
we
had
decided
earlier
that
our
landing
party
should
consist
of
eight
men
wetherell
beckenham
the
mate
of
the
yacht
myself
and
four
of
the
crew
each
of
whom
would
be
supplied
with
a
winchester
repeating
rifle
a
revolver
and
a
dozen
cartridges
not
a
shot
was
to
be
fired
however
unless
absolutely
necessary
and
the
greatest
care
was
to
be
taken
in
order
to
approach
the
hut
if
possible
without
disturbing
its
inmates
when
the
arms
had
been
distributed
and
carefully
examined
the
sixteen
foot
was
uncovered
and
preparations
made
for
hoisting
her
overboard
by
the
time
this
was
done
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
almost
soon
enough
for
us
to
be
thinking
about
overcoming
the
distance
which
separated
us
from
our
destination
about
dusk
i
was
standing
aft
leaning
against
the
when
beckenham
came
up
and
stood
beside
me
it
was
wonderful
what
a
difference
these
few
months
had
made
in
him
he
was
now
as
brown
as
a
berry
and
as
a
young
fellow
as
any
man
could
wish
to
see
we
shall
be
picking
up
the
island
directly
i
said
as
he
came
to
an
anchor
alongside
me
do
you
think
you
ought
to
go
remember
you
will
run
the
risk
of
being
shot
i
have
thought
of
that
he
said
i
believe
it
my
duty
to
do
my
best
to
help
you
and
mr
wetherell
but
what
would
your
father
say
if
he
knew
he
would
say
that
i
only
did
what
was
right
i
have
just
been
writing
to
him
telling
him
everything
if
anything
happen
to
me
you
will
find
the
letter
on
the
chest
of
drawers
in
your
cabin
i
know
you
will
send
it
on
to
him
but
if
we
both
come
out
of
it
safely
and
rescue
miss
wetherell
i
going
to
ask
a
favour
granted
before
i
know
what
it
is
it
is
a
very
big
one
i
want
you
to
let
me
be
your
best
man
at
your
wedding
so
you
shall
and
a
better
i
could
not
possibly
desire
i
like
to
hear
you
say
that
we
been
through
a
good
deal
together
since
we
left
europe
have
we
we
have
and
will
bring
it
to
a
climax
or
i
much
mistaken
do
you
think
nikola
will
show
fight
not
a
doubt
about
it
i
should
think
if
he
finds
himself
cornered
probably
fight
like
a
demon
it
baxter
i
want
to
meet
nikola
is
my
man
i
a
big
grudge
against
him
and
i
want
to
pay
it
how
little
we
thought
when
we
were
cruising
about
bournemouth
bay
together
that
within
such
a
short
space
of
time
we
should
be
sailing
the
south
pacific
on
such
an
errand
it
seems
almost
too
strange
to
be
possible
so
it
does
all
well
that
ends
well
however
let
hope
we
going
to
be
successful
now
i
going
on
the
bridge
to
see
if
i
can
pick
the
land
up
ahead
i
left
him
and
went
forward
to
the
captain
side
dusk
had
quite
fallen
by
this
time
rendering
it
impossible
to
see
very
far
ahead
a
hand
had
been
posted
in
the
as
a
and
every
moment
we
expected
to
hear
his
warning
cry
but
nearly
an
hour
passed
and
still
it
did
not
come
then
suddenly
the
shout
rang
out
land
ahead
and
we
knew
that
our
destination
was
in
sight
long
before
this
all
our
lights
had
been
obscured
and
so
in
the
darkness
for
a
thick
pall
of
cloud
covered
the
sky
we
crept
up
towards
the
coast
within
a
couple
of
minutes
of
hearing
the
hail
every
man
on
board
was
on
deck
gazing
in
the
direction
in
which
we
were
proceeding
by
tea
time
we
had
brought
the
land
considerably
nearer
and
by
eight
were
within
three
miles
of
it
not
a
sign
however
of
any
craft
could
we
discover
and
the
greatest
vigilance
had
to
be
exercised
on
our
part
to
allow
no
sign
to
escape
us
to
show
our
whereabouts
to
those
ashore
exactly
at
nine
the
shore
party
fully
armed
assembled
on
deck
and
the
was
swung
overboard
then
in
the
darkness
we
crept
down
the
gangway
and
took
our
places
the
mate
was
in
possession
of
the
tiller
and
when
all
was
ready
we
set
off
for
the
shore
chapter
vi
conclusion
once
we
had
left
her
side
and
turned
our
boat
nose
towards
the
land
the
yacht
lay
behind
us
a
black
mass
nearly
absorbed
in
the
general
shadow
not
a
light
showed
itself
and
everything
was
as
still
as
the
grave
the
only
noise
to
be
heard
was
the
steady
dip
dip
of
the
oars
in
the
smooth
water
and
now
and
then
the
chirp
of
the
rowlocks
for
nearly
half
an
hour
we
pulled
on
pausing
at
intervals
to
listen
but
nothing
of
an
alarming
nature
met
our
ears
the
island
was
every
moment
growing
larger
the
beach
more
plain
to
the
eye
and
the
hill
more
clearly
defined
as
soon
as
the
boat
grounded
we
sprang
out
and
leaving
one
hand
to
look
after
her
made
our
way
ashore
it
was
a
strange
experience
that
landing
on
a
strange
beach
on
such
an
errand
and
at
such
an
hour
but
we
were
all
too
much
taken
up
with
the
work
which
lay
before
us
to
think
of
that
having
left
the
water
edge
we
came
to
a
standstill
beneath
a
group
of
palms
and
discussed
the
situation
as
the
command
of
the
expedition
had
fallen
upon
me
i
decided
upon
the
following
course
of
action
to
begin
with
i
would
leave
the
party
behind
me
and
set
out
by
myself
to
ascertain
the
whereabouts
of
the
hut
having
discovered
this
i
would
return
and
we
would
thereupon
make
our
way
inland
and
endeavour
to
capture
it
i
explained
the
idea
in
as
few
words
as
possible
to
my
followers
and
then
bidding
them
wait
for
me
where
they
were
at
the
same
time
warning
them
against
letting
their
presence
be
discovered
i
set
off
up
the
hill
in
the
direction
i
knew
the
plateau
to
lie
the
undergrowth
was
very
thick
and
the
ground
rocky
for
this
reason
it
was
nearly
twenty
minutes
before
i
readied
the
top
of
the
hill
then
down
the
other
side
i
crept
picking
my
way
carefully
and
taking
infinite
precautions
that
no
noise
should
serve
to
warn
our
foes
of
my
coming
at
last
i
reached
the
plateau
and
looked
about
me
a
small
perpendicular
cliff
some
sixty
feet
in
height
was
before
me
so
throwing
myself
down
upon
my
stomach
i
wriggled
my
way
to
its
edge
when
i
got
there
i
looked
over
and
discovered
three
huts
on
a
little
plateau
at
the
cliff
base
at
the
same
moment
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
my
ears
from
the
building
on
the
left
it
was
followed
by
the
voice
of
a
man
singing
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
banjo
under
cover
of
his
music
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
crept
back
through
the
bushes
by
the
track
along
which
i
had
come
i
knew
enough
to
distribute
my
forces
now
having
reached
my
friends
again
i
informed
them
of
what
i
had
seen
and
we
then
arranged
the
mode
of
attack
as
follows
the
mate
of
the
yacht
with
two
of
the
hands
would
pass
round
the
hill
to
the
left
of
the
plateau
wetherell
and
another
couple
of
men
would
take
the
right
side
while
beckenham
and
myself
crept
down
from
the
back
not
a
sound
was
to
be
made
or
a
shot
fired
until
i
blew
my
whistle
then
with
one
last
word
of
caution
we
started
on
our
climb
by
this
time
the
clouds
had
cleared
off
the
sky
and
the
stars
shone
brightly
once
more
i
arrived
at
the
small
precipice
behind
the
huts
and
having
done
so
sat
down
for
a
few
moments
to
give
the
other
parties
time
to
take
up
their
positions
then
signing
to
beckenham
to
accompany
me
i
followed
the
trend
of
the
precipice
along
till
i
discovered
a
place
where
we
might
descend
in
safety
in
less
than
a
minute
we
were
on
the
plateau
below
creeping
towards
the
centre
hut
still
our
approach
was
undetected
bidding
beckenham
in
a
whisper
wait
for
me
i
crept
cautiously
round
to
the
front
keeping
as
much
as
possible
in
the
shadow
as
soon
as
i
had
found
the
door
i
tiptoed
towards
it
and
prepared
to
force
my
way
inside
but
i
had
an
adventure
in
store
for
me
which
i
had
not
anticipated
seated
in
the
doorway
almost
hidden
in
the
shadow
was
the
figure
of
a
man
he
must
have
been
asleep
for
he
did
not
become
aware
of
my
presence
until
i
was
within
a
foot
of
him
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
was
about
to
give
the
alarm
before
he
could
do
so
however
i
was
upon
him
a
desperate
struggle
followed
in
which
i
fought
solely
for
his
throat
this
once
obtained
i
tightened
my
fingers
upon
it
and
squeezed
until
he
fell
back
unconscious
it
was
like
a
horrible
nightmare
that
combat
without
noise
in
the
dark
entry
of
the
hut
and
i
was
more
than
thankful
that
it
ended
so
satisfactorily
for
me
as
soon
as
i
had
disentangled
myself
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
proceeded
across
his
body
into
the
hut
itself
a
swing
door
led
from
the
porch
and
this
i
pushed
open
who
is
it
and
what
do
you
want
said
a
voice
which
i
should
have
recognized
anywhere
in
answer
i
took
phyllis
in
my
arms
and
whispering
my
name
kissed
her
over
and
over
again
she
uttered
a
little
cry
of
astonishment
and
delight
then
bidding
her
step
quietly
i
passed
out
into
the
starlight
leading
her
after
me
as
we
were
about
to
make
for
the
path
by
which
i
had
descended
beckenham
stepped
forward
and
at
the
same
instant
the
man
with
whom
i
had
been
wrestling
came
to
his
senses
and
gave
a
shout
of
alarm
in
an
instant
there
was
a
noise
of
scurrying
feet
and
a
great
shouting
of
orders
make
for
the
boats
i
cried
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
taking
phyllis
by
the
hand
set
off
as
quickly
as
i
could
go
up
the
path
beckenham
assisting
her
on
the
other
side
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
i
shall
never
forget
that
rush
up
the
hill
in
and
out
of
trees
and
bushes
scratching
ourselves
and
tearing
our
clothes
we
dashed
conscious
only
of
the
necessity
for
speed
before
we
were
down
the
other
side
phyllis
strength
was
quite
exhausted
so
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
the
remainder
of
the
distance
at
last
we
reached
the
boat
and
jumped
on
board
the
rest
of
the
party
were
already
there
and
the
word
being
given
we
prepared
to
row
out
to
the
yacht
but
before
we
could
push
off
a
painful
surprise
was
in
store
for
us
the
marquis
who
had
been
counting
the
party
cried
is
wetherell
we
looked
round
upon
each
other
and
surely
enough
the
old
gentleman
was
missing
discovering
this
phyllis
nearly
gave
way
and
implored
us
to
go
back
at
once
to
find
him
but
having
rescued
her
with
so
much
difficulty
i
did
not
wish
to
run
any
risk
of
letting
her
fall
into
her
enemies
hands
again
so
selecting
four
volunteers
from
the
party
i
bade
the
rest
pull
the
boat
out
to
the
yacht
and
give
miss
wetherell
into
the
captain
charge
while
the
others
accompanied
me
ashore
again
in
search
of
her
father
having
done
this
the
boat
was
to
return
and
wait
for
us
quickly
we
splashed
our
way
back
to
the
beach
and
then
plunging
into
the
undergrowth
began
our
search
for
the
missing
man
as
we
did
not
know
where
to
search
it
was
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
but
presently
one
of
the
hands
remembered
having
seen
him
descending
the
hill
so
we
devoted
our
attentions
to
that
side
for
nearly
two
hours
we
toiled
up
and
down
but
without
success
not
a
sign
of
the
old
gentleman
was
to
be
seen
could
he
have
mistaken
his
way
and
be
even
now
searching
for
us
on
another
beach
to
make
sure
of
this
we
set
off
and
thoroughly
searched
the
two
bays
in
the
direction
he
would
most
likely
have
taken
but
still
without
success
perhaps
he
had
been
captured
and
carried
back
to
the
huts
in
that
case
we
had
better
proceed
thither
and
try
to
rescue
him
this
however
was
a
much
more
serious
undertaking
and
you
may
imagine
it
was
with
considerable
care
that
we
approached
the
plateau
again
when
we
reached
it
the
huts
were
as
quiet
as
when
i
had
first
made
their
acquaintance
not
a
sound
came
up
to
the
top
of
the
little
precipice
save
the
rustling
of
the
wind
in
the
palms
at
its
foot
it
seemed
difficult
to
believe
that
there
had
been
such
a
tumult
on
the
spot
so
short
a
time
before
again
with
infinite
care
we
crept
down
to
the
buildings
this
time
however
without
encountering
a
soul
the
first
was
empty
so
was
the
second
and
so
was
the
third
this
result
was
quite
unexpected
and
rendered
the
situation
even
more
mysterious
than
before
by
the
time
we
had
thoroughly
explored
the
plateau
and
its
surroundings
it
was
nearly
daylight
and
still
we
had
discovered
no
trace
of
the
missing
man
just
as
the
sun
rose
above
the
sea
line
we
descended
the
hill
again
and
commenced
a
second
search
along
the
beach
with
no
better
luck
however
than
on
the
previous
occasion
wetherell
and
our
assailants
seemed
to
have
completely
disappeared
from
the
island
about
six
thoroughly
worn
out
we
returned
to
the
spot
where
the
boat
was
waiting
for
us
what
was
to
be
done
we
could
not
for
obvious
reasons
leave
the
island
and
abandon
the
old
gentleman
to
his
fate
and
yet
it
seemed
useless
to
remain
there
looking
for
him
when
he
might
have
been
spirited
away
elsewhere
suddenly
one
of
the
crew
who
had
been
loitering
behind
came
into
view
waving
something
in
his
hand
as
he
approached
we
could
see
that
it
was
a
sheet
of
paper
and
when
he
gave
it
into
my
hands
i
read
as
follows
if
you
cross
the
island
to
the
north
beach
you
will
find
a
small
cliff
in
which
is
a
large
cave
a
little
above
mark
there
you
will
discover
the
man
for
whom
you
are
searching
there
was
no
signature
to
this
epistle
and
the
writing
was
quite
unfamiliar
to
me
but
i
had
no
reason
to
doubt
its
authenticity
where
did
you
discover
this
i
inquired
of
the
man
who
had
brought
it
fastened
to
one
of
them
prickly
bushes
up
on
the
beach
there
sir
he
answered
well
the
only
thing
for
us
to
do
now
is
to
set
off
to
the
north
shore
and
hunt
for
the
cave
two
of
you
had
better
take
the
boat
back
to
the
yacht
and
ask
the
captain
to
follow
us
round
as
soon
as
the
boat
was
under
weigh
we
picked
up
our
rifles
and
set
off
for
the
north
beach
it
was
swelteringly
hot
by
this
time
and
as
may
be
imagined
we
were
all
dead
tired
after
our
long
night
work
however
the
men
knew
they
would
be
amply
rewarded
if
we
could
effect
the
rescue
of
the
man
for
whom
we
had
been
searching
so
they
pushed
on
at
last
we
turned
the
cape
and
entered
the
bay
which
constituted
the
north
end
of
the
island
it
was
not
a
large
beach
on
this
side
but
it
had
at
its
western
end
a
curious
line
of
small
cliffs
in
the
centre
of
which
a
small
black
spot
could
be
discerned
looking
remarkably
like
the
entrance
to
a
cave
towards
this
we
pressed
forgetting
our
weariness
in
the
excitement
of
the
search
it
a
cave
and
a
large
one
so
far
the
letter
was
correct
preparing
ourselves
in
case
of
surprise
we
approached
the
entrance
calling
wetherell
name
as
our
shouts
died
away
a
voice
came
out
in
answer
and
thereupon
we
rushed
in
a
remarkable
sight
met
our
eyes
in
the
centre
of
the
cave
was
a
stout
upright
post
some
six
or
eight
feet
in
height
and
securely
tied
to
this
was
the
colonial
secretary
of
new
south
wales
in
less
time
almost
than
it
takes
to
tell
we
had
cast
loose
the
ropes
which
bound
him
and
led
him
for
he
was
too
weak
to
stand
alone
out
into
the
open
air
while
he
was
resting
he
inquired
after
his
daughter
and
having
learned
that
she
was
safe
gave
us
the
following
explanation
addressing
himself
to
me
he
said
when
you
cried
for
the
boats
i
ran
up
the
hill
with
the
others
as
fast
as
i
could
go
but
i
an
old
man
and
could
not
get
along
as
quickly
as
i
wanted
to
and
for
this
reason
was
soon
left
far
behind
i
must
have
been
down
the
hill
when
a
tall
man
dressed
in
white
stepped
out
from
behind
a
bush
and
raising
a
rifle
bade
me
come
to
a
standstill
having
no
time
to
lift
my
own
weapon
i
was
obliged
to
do
as
he
ordered
me
and
he
thereupon
told
me
to
lay
down
my
weapon
and
face
in
this
fashion
i
was
marched
back
to
the
huts
we
had
just
left
and
then
another
man
having
joined
my
captor
was
conducted
across
the
island
to
this
beach
where
a
boat
was
in
waiting
in
it
i
was
pulled
out
to
a
small
schooner
lying
at
anchor
in
the
bay
and
ordered
to
board
her
five
minutes
later
i
was
conducted
to
the
saloon
wetherell
this
is
indeed
a
pleasure
said
a
man
sitting
at
the
farther
end
of
the
table
he
was
playing
with
a
big
black
cat
and
directly
i
heard
his
voice
i
knew
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
nikola
how
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
punish
you
my
friend
for
giving
me
all
this
trouble
he
said
when
i
made
no
reply
to
his
first
remark
dare
not
do
anything
to
me
i
answered
demand
that
you
let
me
go
this
instant
i
have
a
big
score
to
settle
with
you
you
will
be
warned
by
me
you
will
cease
to
demand
he
answered
his
eyes
the
while
burning
like
coals
are
an
obstinate
man
but
though
you
have
put
me
to
so
much
trouble
and
expense
i
will
forgive
you
and
come
to
terms
with
you
now
listen
to
me
if
you
will
give
me
at
that
moment
the
little
vessel
gave
a
heavy
roll
and
in
trying
to
keep
my
footing
on
the
sloping
deck
i
fell
over
upon
the
table
as
i
did
so
the
little
chinese
stick
slipped
out
of
my
pocket
and
went
rolling
along
directly
into
nikola
hands
he
sprang
forward
and
seized
it
and
you
may
imagine
his
delight
with
a
cry
of
triumph
that
made
the
cat
leap
from
his
shoulder
he
turned
to
a
tall
man
by
his
side
and
said
got
it
at
last
now
let
a
boat
crew
take
this
man
ashore
and
tie
him
to
the
stake
in
the
cave
then
devise
some
means
of
acquainting
his
friends
of
his
whereabouts
be
quick
for
we
sail
in
an
hour
having
given
these
orders
he
turned
to
me
again
and
said
wetherell
this
is
the
last
transaction
we
shall
probably
ever
have
together
all
things
considered
you
are
lucky
in
escaping
so
easily
it
would
have
saved
you
a
good
deal
if
you
had
complied
with
my
request
at
first
however
all
well
that
ends
well
and
i
congratulate
you
upon
your
charming
daughter
now
in
an
hour
i
am
off
to
effect
a
with
this
stick
the
magnitude
of
which
you
would
never
dream
one
last
word
of
advice
pause
a
second
time
i
entreat
before
you
think
of
baulking
dr
nikola
i
was
going
to
reply
when
i
was
twisted
round
and
led
up
on
deck
where
that
scoundrel
baxter
had
the
impudence
to
make
me
a
low
bow
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
was
fastened
to
the
post
in
that
cave
the
rest
you
know
now
let
us
get
on
board
i
see
the
boat
is
approaching
as
soon
as
the
had
drawn
up
on
the
beach
we
embarked
and
were
pulled
out
to
the
yacht
in
a
few
moments
we
were
on
deck
and
phyllis
was
in
her
father
arms
again
by
the
island
had
disappeared
under
the
sea
line
and
by
nightfall
we
were
well
on
our
way
back
to
sydney
that
evening
after
dinner
phyllis
and
i
patrolled
the
deck
together
and
finally
came
to
a
standstill
aft
it
was
as
beautiful
an
evening
as
any
man
or
woman
could
desire
all
round
us
was
the
glassy
sea
rising
and
falling
as
if
asleep
while
overhead
the
tropic
stars
shone
down
with
their
wonderful
brilliance
phyllis
i
said
taking
my
darling
hand
in
mine
and
looking
into
her
face
what
a
series
of
adventures
we
have
both
passed
through
since
that
afternoon
i
first
saw
you
in
the
domain
do
you
know
that
your
father
has
at
last
consented
to
our
marriage
i
do
and
as
it
is
to
you
dick
i
owe
my
rescue
she
said
coming
a
little
closer
to
me
he
could
do
nothing
else
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
me
i
have
and
i
mean
to
assert
it
i
answered
if
i
had
not
found
you
i
should
never
have
been
happy
again
but
dick
there
is
one
thing
i
do
at
all
understand
at
dinner
this
evening
the
captain
addressed
you
as
sir
richard
what
does
that
mean
why
of
course
you
have
not
heard
i
cried
well
i
think
it
means
that
though
i
can
not
make
you
a
marchioness
i
can
make
you
a
wife
it
remains
with
you
to
say
whether
you
will
be
lady
hatteras
or
not
then
i
explained
how
i
had
inherited
the
title
and
estates
her
only
reply
was
to
kiss
me
softly
on
the
cheek
she
had
scarcely
done
so
before
her
father
and
beckenham
came
along
the
deck
now
phyllis
said
the
former
leading
her
to
a
seat
supposing
you
give
us
the
history
of
your
adventures
remember
we
have
heard
nothing
yet
very
well
where
shall
i
begin
at
the
moment
i
left
the
house
for
the
ball
very
good
well
you
must
know
that
when
i
arrived
at
government
house
i
met
mayford
the
lady
who
had
promised
to
chaperone
me
in
the
and
we
passed
into
the
together
i
danced
the
first
dance
with
captain
hackworth
one
of
the
and
engaged
myself
for
the
fourth
to
the
marquis
of
beckenham
the
sham
marquis
unfortunately
put
in
the
real
one
it
proved
to
be
unfortunate
for
me
also
continued
phyllis
as
it
was
a
square
we
sat
it
out
in
the
leading
off
the
and
while
we
were
there
the
young
gentleman
did
me
the
honour
of
proposing
to
me
it
was
terribly
embarrassing
for
me
but
i
allowed
him
to
see
as
unmistakably
as
possible
that
i
could
give
him
no
encouragement
and
as
the
introduction
to
the
next
waltz
started
we
parted
the
best
of
friends
about
half
an
hour
later
just
as
i
was
going
to
dance
the
lancers
mayford
came
towards
me
and
drew
me
into
the
baxter
his
lordship
tutor
was
with
her
and
i
noticed
that
they
both
looked
supernaturally
grave
is
the
matter
i
asked
becoming
alarmed
by
her
face
dear
said
she
must
be
brave
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
your
father
has
been
taken
ill
and
has
sent
for
you
ill
i
cried
i
must
go
home
to
him
at
have
taken
the
liberty
of
facilitating
that
said
baxter
ordering
the
servants
to
call
up
your
carriage
which
is
now
waiting
for
you
at
the
door
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
conduct
you
to
it
i
apologized
to
my
partner
for
being
compelled
to
leave
him
and
then
went
to
the
as
soon
as
i
was
ready
i
accompanied
baxter
to
the
door
where
the
brougham
was
waiting
without
looking
at
the
coachman
i
got
in
at
the
same
time
thanking
my
escort
for
his
kindness
he
shut
the
door
and
cried
to
the
coachman
next
moment
we
were
spinning
down
the
drive
as
i
was
far
too
much
occupied
thinking
of
you
papa
i
did
not
notice
the
direction
we
were
taking
and
it
was
not
until
the
carriage
stopped
before
a
house
in
a
back
street
that
i
realized
that
something
was
wrong
then
the
door
was
opened
and
a
gentleman
in
evening
dress
begged
me
to
alight
i
did
so
almost
without
thinking
what
i
was
doing
am
sorry
to
say
your
father
is
not
at
all
well
miss
wetherell
said
the
person
who
helped
me
out
you
will
be
good
enough
to
step
into
my
house
i
will
let
the
nurse
take
you
to
him
like
a
person
in
a
dream
i
followed
him
into
the
dwelling
is
my
father
and
how
is
it
that
he
is
here
i
cried
beginning
to
get
frightened
will
know
all
when
you
see
him
said
my
companion
throwing
open
the
door
of
a
bedroom
i
went
in
and
that
door
was
also
shut
upon
me
then
i
turned
and
faced
the
man
what
was
he
like
cried
wetherell
he
was
the
man
you
were
telling
us
about
at
dinner
dr
nikola
ah
and
then
he
politely
but
firmly
informed
me
that
i
was
his
prisoner
and
that
until
you
gave
up
something
he
had
for
years
been
trying
to
obtain
he
would
be
compelled
to
detain
me
i
threatened
entreated
and
finally
wept
but
he
was
not
to
be
moved
he
promised
that
no
effort
should
be
spared
to
make
me
comfortable
but
he
could
not
let
me
go
until
you
had
complied
with
his
request
so
i
was
kept
there
until
late
one
night
when
i
was
informed
that
i
must
be
ready
to
leave
the
house
a
brougham
was
at
the
door
and
in
this
securely
guarded
i
was
conducted
to
the
harbour
where
a
boat
was
in
waiting
in
this
we
were
rowed
out
to
a
schooner
and
i
was
placed
on
board
her
a
comfortably
furnished
cabin
was
allotted
to
me
and
everything
i
could
possibly
want
was
given
me
but
though
the
greatest
consideration
in
all
other
matters
was
shown
me
i
could
gather
nothing
of
where
we
were
going
or
what
my
fate
was
to
be
nor
could
i
discover
any
means
of
communicating
with
the
shore
about
midnight
we
got
under
weigh
and
commenced
our
voyage
our
destination
was
the
island
where
you
found
me
and
how
did
nikola
treat
you
during
the
voyage
and
your
stay
on
pipa
lannu
i
asked
with
invariable
courtesy
she
replied
a
more
admirable
host
no
one
could
desire
i
had
but
to
express
a
wish
and
it
was
instantly
gratified
when
we
were
clear
of
the
land
i
was
allowed
on
deck
my
meals
were
served
to
me
in
a
cabin
adjoining
my
own
and
a
stewardess
had
been
specially
engaged
to
wait
upon
me
as
far
as
my
own
treatment
went
i
have
nothing
to
complain
of
but
oh
you
ca
tell
how
thankful
i
was
to
get
away
i
imagined
all
sorts
of
horrors
well
god
be
thanked
it
all
done
with
now
i
said
earnestly
and
what
is
more
said
wetherell
you
have
won
one
of
the
best
husbands
in
the
world
hatteras
your
hand
sir
phyllis
my
darling
yours
god
bless
you
both
a
week
later
the
eventful
voyage
was
over
and
we
were
back
in
sydney
again
then
came
our
marriage
but
with
your
kind
permission
i
will
only
give
you
a
very
bare
description
of
that
it
took
place
at
the
cathedral
the
primate
officiating
the
marquis
of
beckenham
was
kind
enough
to
act
as
my
best
man
while
the
colonial
secretary
of
course
gave
his
daughter
away
but
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
there
is
one
point
i
touch
upon
in
connexion
with
that
happy
occasion
and
that
was
the
arrival
of
an
important
present
on
the
evening
prior
to
the
event
we
were
sitting
in
the
when
the
butler
brought
in
a
square
parcel
on
a
salver
and
handed
it
to
phyllis
another
present
i
expect
she
said
and
began
to
untie
the
string
that
bound
it
when
the
first
cover
was
removed
a
layer
of
tissue
paper
revealed
itself
and
after
that
a
large
russia
leather
case
came
into
view
on
pressing
the
spring
the
cover
lifted
and
revealed
a
superb
as
i
believe
it
is
called
of
diamonds
and
resting
against
the
lid
a
small
card
bearing
this
inscription
with
heartiest
congratulations
and
best
wishes
to
lady
hatteras
in
memory
of
an
unfortunate
detention
and
a
voyage
to
the
southern
seas
from
her
sincere
admirer
dr
nikola
what
do
you
think
of
that
well
to
bring
my
long
story
to
a
close
the
great
event
passed
off
with
much
we
spent
our
honeymoon
in
the
blue
mountains
and
a
fortnight
later
sailed
once
more
for
england
in
the
both
wetherell
who
has
now
resigned
office
and
the
marquis
of
beckenham
who
is
as
manly
a
fellow
as
you
would
meet
anywhere
in
england
accompanied
us
home
and
it
was
to
the
latter
seaside
residence
that
we
went
immediately
on
our
arrival
in
the
mother
country
my
own
new
forest
residence
is
being
thoroughly
renovated
and
will
be
ready
for
occupation
in
the
spring
and
now
as
to
the
other
persons
who
have
figured
most
prominently
in
my
narrative
of
nikola
baxter
eastover
or
prendergast
i
have
never
heard
since
what
gigantic
the
intends
to
accomplish
with
the
little
chinese
stick
the
possession
of
which
proved
so
fatal
to
wetherell
is
beyond
my
power
to
tell
i
am
only
too
thankful
however
that
i
am
able
to
say
that
i
am
not
in
the
least
concerned
in
it
i
am
afraid
of
nikola
and
i
confess
it
and
with
this
honest
expression
of
my
feelings
and
my
thanks
for
your
attention
and
forbearance
i
will
beg
your
permission
to
ring
the
curtain
down
upon
the
narrative
of
my
bid
for
fortune
the
end
