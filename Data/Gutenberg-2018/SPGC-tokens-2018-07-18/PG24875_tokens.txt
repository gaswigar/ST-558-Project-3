oh

fretted
nan
wallace
twisting
herself
about
uneasily
on
the
sofa
in
her
pretty
room
i
never
thought
before
that
the
days
could
be
so
long
as
they
are
now
poor
you
said
her
sister
maude
sympathetically
maude
was
moving
briskly
about
the
room
putting
it
into
the
beautiful
order
that
mother
insisted
on
it
was
nan
week
to
care
for
their
room
but
nan
had
sprained
her
ankle
three
days
ago
and
could
do
nothing
but
lie
on
the
sofa
ever
since
and
very
tired
of
it
too
was
active
nan
and
the
picnic
this
afternoon
too
she
sighed
i
looked
forward
to
it
all
summer
and
it
a
perfect
day
and
i
got
to
stay
here
and
nurse
this
foot
nan
looked
vindictively
at
the
bandaged
member
while
maude
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
pull
a
pink
climbing
rose
as
she
did
so
she
nodded
to
someone
in
the
village
street
below
who
is
passing
asked
nan
florrie
hamilton
is
she
going
to
the
picnic
asked
nan
indifferently
no
she
was
asked
of
course
i
do
suppose
she
expected
to
be
she
knows
she
is
in
our
set
she
must
feel
horribly
out
of
place
at
school
a
lot
of
the
girls
say
it
is
ridiculous
of
her
father
to
send
her
to
miss
braxton
private
school
a
factory
overseer
daughter
she
ought
to
have
been
asked
to
the
picnic
all
the
same
said
nan
shortly
she
is
in
our
class
if
she
is
in
our
set
of
course
i
do
suppose
she
would
have
enjoyed
herself
or
even
gone
at
all
for
that
matter
she
certainly
does
push
herself
in
among
us
one
would
think
she
had
a
tongue
in
her
head
she
is
the
best
student
in
the
class
admitted
maude
arranging
her
roses
in
a
vase
and
putting
them
on
the
table
at
nan
elbow
but
patty
morrison
and
wilhelmina
patterson
had
the
most
to
say
about
the
invitations
and
they
would
have
her
there
nannie
dear
those
lovely
i
leave
them
here
to
be
company
for
you
i
going
to
have
more
company
than
that
said
nan
thumping
her
pillow
energetically
i
not
going
to
mope
here
alone
all
the
afternoon
with
you
off
having
a
jolly
time
at
the
picnic
write
a
little
note
for
me
to
florrie
hastings
will
you
i
do
as
much
for
you
when
you
sprain
your
foot
what
shall
i
put
in
it
said
maude
rummaging
out
her
portfolio
obligingly
oh
just
ask
her
if
she
will
come
down
and
cheer
a
poor
invalid
up
this
afternoon
she
come
i
know
and
she
is
such
good
company
get
dickie
to
run
right
out
and
mail
it
i
do
wonder
if
florrie
hamilton
will
feel
hurt
over
not
being
asked
to
the
picnic
speculated
maude
absently
as
she
slipped
her
note
into
an
envelope
and
addressed
it
florrie
hamilton
herself
could
best
have
answered
that
question
as
she
walked
along
the
street
in
the
fresh
morning
sunshine
she
did
feel
hurt
much
more
keenly
than
she
would
acknowledge
even
to
herself
it
was
not
that
she
cared
about
the
picnic
itself
as
nan
wallace
had
said
she
would
not
have
been
likely
to
enjoy
herself
if
she
had
gone
among
a
crowd
of
girls
many
of
whom
looked
down
on
her
and
ignored
her
but
to
be
left
out
when
every
other
girl
in
the
school
was
invited
florrie
lip
quivered
as
she
thought
of
it
i
get
father
to
let
me
to
go
to
the
public
school
after
vacation
she
murmured
i
hate
going
to
miss
braxton
florrie
was
a
newcomer
in
winboro
her
father
had
recently
come
to
take
a
position
in
the
largest
factory
of
the
small
town
for
this
reason
florrie
was
slighted
at
school
by
some
of
the
ruder
girls
and
severely
left
alone
by
most
of
the
others
some
it
is
true
tried
at
the
start
to
be
friends
but
florrie
too
keenly
sensitive
to
the
atmosphere
around
her
to
respond
was
believed
to
be
decidedly
dull
and
mopy
she
retreated
further
and
further
into
herself
and
was
almost
as
solitary
at
miss
braxton
as
if
she
had
been
on
a
desert
island
they
do
like
me
because
i
am
plainly
dressed
and
because
my
father
is
not
a
wealthy
man
thought
florrie
bitterly
and
there
was
enough
truth
in
this
in
regard
to
many
of
miss
braxton
girls
to
make
a
very
uncomfortable
state
of
affairs
here
a
letter
for
you
flo
said
her
brother
jack
at
noon
got
it
at
the
office
on
my
way
home
who
is
your
swell
correspondent
florrie
opened
the
dainty
perfumed
note
and
read
it
with
a
face
that
puzzled
at
first
suddenly
grew
radiant
listen
jack
she
said
excitedly
dear
florrie
nan
is
confined
to
house
room
and
sofa
with
a
sprained
foot
as
she
will
be
all
alone
this
afternoon
wo
you
come
down
and
spend
it
with
her
she
very
much
wants
you
to
come
she
is
so
lonesome
and
thinks
you
will
be
just
the
one
to
cheer
her
up
yours
cordially
maude
wallace
are
you
going
asked
jack
yes
i
do
know
i
think
about
it
said
florrie
absently
then
she
hurried
upstairs
to
her
room
shall
i
go
she
thought
yes
i
will
i
dare
say
nan
has
asked
me
just
out
of
pity
because
i
was
not
invited
to
the
picnic
but
even
so
it
was
sweet
of
her
i
always
thought
i
would
like
those
wallace
girls
if
i
could
get
really
acquainted
with
them
they
always
been
nice
to
me
too
i
do
know
why
i
am
always
so
and
stupid
with
them
but
i
go
anyway
that
afternoon
wallace
came
into
nan
room
nan
dear
florrie
hamilton
is
downstairs
asking
for
you
florrie
hamilton
yes
she
said
something
about
a
note
you
sent
her
this
morning
shall
i
ask
her
to
come
up
yes
of
course
said
nan
lamely
when
her
mother
had
gone
out
she
fell
back
on
her
pillows
and
thought
rapidly
florrie
hamilton
maude
must
have
addressed
that
note
to
her
by
mistake
but
she
must
know
it
was
a
mistake
must
suspect
it
oh
dear
what
shall
i
ever
find
to
talk
to
her
about
she
is
so
quiet
and
shy
further
reflections
were
cut
short
by
florrie
entrance
nan
held
out
her
hand
with
a
chummy
smile
it
good
of
you
to
give
your
afternoon
up
to
visiting
a
cranky
invalid
she
said
heartily
you
do
know
how
lonesome
i
been
since
maude
went
away
take
off
your
hat
and
pick
out
the
nicest
chair
you
can
find
and
let
be
comfy
somehow
nan
frank
greeting
did
away
with
florrie
embarrassment
and
made
her
feel
at
home
she
sat
down
in
maude
rocker
then
glancing
over
to
a
vase
filled
with
roses
her
eyes
kindled
with
pleasure
seeing
this
nan
said
are
they
lovely
we
wallaces
are
very
fond
of
our
climbing
roses
our
brought
the
roots
out
from
england
with
her
sixty
years
ago
and
they
grow
nowhere
else
in
this
country
i
know
said
florrie
with
a
smile
i
recognized
them
as
soon
as
i
came
into
the
room
they
are
the
same
kind
of
roses
as
those
which
grow
about
grandmother
hamilton
house
in
england
i
used
to
love
them
so
in
england
were
you
ever
in
england
oh
yes
laughed
florrie
and
i
been
in
pretty
nearly
every
other
country
upon
earth
every
one
that
a
ship
could
get
to
at
least
why
florrie
hamilton
are
you
in
earnest
indeed
yes
perhaps
you
do
know
that
our
as
jack
says
sometimes
is
father
second
wife
my
own
mother
died
when
i
was
a
baby
and
my
aunt
who
had
no
children
of
her
own
took
me
to
bring
up
her
husband
was
a
and
she
always
went
on
his
with
him
so
i
went
too
i
almost
grew
up
on
shipboard
we
had
delightful
times
i
never
went
to
school
auntie
had
been
a
teacher
before
her
marriage
and
she
taught
me
two
years
ago
when
i
was
fourteen
father
married
again
and
then
he
wanted
me
to
go
home
to
him
and
jack
and
our
new
mother
so
i
did
although
at
first
i
was
very
sorry
to
leave
auntie
and
the
dear
old
ship
and
all
our
lovely
wanderings
oh
tell
me
all
about
them
demanded
nan
why
florrie
hamilton
to
think
you
never
said
a
word
about
your
wonderful
experiences
i
love
to
hear
about
foreign
countries
from
people
who
have
really
been
there
please
just
talk
and
i
listen
and
ask
questions
florrie
did
talk
i
not
sure
whether
she
or
nan
was
the
more
surprised
to
find
that
she
could
talk
so
well
and
describe
her
travels
so
brightly
and
humorously
the
afternoon
passed
quickly
and
when
florrie
went
away
at
dusk
after
a
dainty
tea
served
up
in
nan
room
it
was
with
a
cordial
invitation
to
come
again
soon
i
enjoyed
your
visit
so
much
said
nan
sincerely
i
going
down
to
see
you
as
soon
as
i
can
walk
but
do
wait
for
that
let
us
be
good
chummy
friends
without
any
ceremony
when
florrie
with
a
light
heart
and
a
happy
smile
had
gone
came
maude
sunburned
and
glowing
from
her
picnic
such
a
nice
time
as
we
had
she
exclaimed
was
i
sorry
to
think
of
you
cooped
up
here
did
florrie
come
one
florrie
did
maude
you
addressed
that
note
to
florrie
hamilton
today
instead
of
florrie
hastings
nan
surely
not
i
sure
yes
you
did
and
she
came
here
was
i
not
taken
aback
at
first
maude
i
was
thinking
about
her
when
i
addressed
it
and
i
must
have
put
her
name
down
by
mistake
i
so
sorry
you
need
be
i
have
been
entertained
so
charmingly
for
a
long
while
why
maude
she
has
travelled
almost
everywhere
and
is
so
bright
and
witty
when
she
thaws
out
she
did
seem
like
the
same
girl
at
all
she
is
just
perfectly
lovely
well
i
glad
you
had
such
a
nice
time
together
do
you
know
some
of
the
girls
were
very
much
vexed
because
she
was
asked
to
the
picnic
they
said
that
it
was
sheer
rudeness
not
to
ask
her
and
that
it
reflected
on
us
all
even
if
patty
and
wilhelmina
were
responsible
for
it
i
afraid
we
girls
at
miss
braxton
have
been
getting
snobbish
and
some
of
us
are
beginning
to
find
it
out
and
be
ashamed
of
it
just
wait
until
school
opens
said
nan
vaguely
enough
it
would
seem
but
maude
understood
however
they
did
not
have
to
wait
until
school
opened
long
before
that
time
winboro
girlhood
discovered
that
the
wallace
girls
were
taking
florrie
hamilton
into
their
lives
if
the
wallace
girls
liked
her
there
must
be
something
in
the
girl
more
than
was
at
first
thought
thus
more
than
one
of
miss
braxton
girls
reasoned
and
gradually
the
other
girls
found
as
nan
had
found
that
florrie
was
full
of
fun
and
an
good
companion
when
drawn
out
of
her
diffidence
when
miss
braxton
school
reopened
florrie
was
the
class
favourite
between
her
and
nan
wallace
a
beautiful
and
helpful
friendship
had
been
formed
which
was
to
grow
and
deepen
through
their
whole
lives
and
all
because
maude
in
a
fit
of
abstraction
wrote
for
said
nan
to
herself
one
day
but
that
is
something
florrie
hamilton
will
never
know
an
unpremeditated
ceremony
selwyn
grant
sauntered
in
upon
the
assembled
family
at
the
homestead
as
if
he
were
returning
from
an
hour
absence
instead
of
a
western
sojourn
of
ten
years
guided
by
the
sound
of
voices
on
the
still
pungent
autumnal
air
he
went
around
to
the
door
of
the
dining
room
which
opened
directly
on
the
poppy
walk
in
the
garden
nobody
noticed
him
for
a
moment
and
he
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
at
them
with
a
smile
wondering
what
was
the
reason
of
the
festal
air
that
hung
about
them
all
as
visibly
as
a
garment
his
mother
sat
by
the
table
industriously
polishing
the
best
silver
spoons
which
as
he
remembered
were
only
brought
forth
upon
some
great
occasion
her
eyes
were
as
bright
her
form
as
erect
her
nose
the
carston
nose
as
pronounced
and
aristocratic
as
of
yore
selwyn
saw
little
change
in
her
but
was
it
possible
that
the
tall
handsome
young
lady
with
the
sleek
brown
pompadour
and
a
nose
unmistakably
and
plebeianly
grant
who
sat
by
the
window
doing
something
to
a
heap
of
lace
and
organdy
in
her
lap
was
the
little
sunburned
sister
of
thirteen
whom
he
remembered
the
young
man
leaning
against
the
sideboard
must
be
leo
of
course
a
young
fellow
who
made
selwyn
think
suddenly
that
he
must
be
growing
old
and
there
was
the
little
thin
grey
father
in
the
corner
peering
at
his
newspaper
with
nearsighted
eyes
selwyn
heart
gave
a
bound
at
the
sight
of
him
which
not
even
his
mother
had
caused
dear
old
dad
the
years
had
been
kind
to
him
grant
held
up
a
glistening
spoon
and
surveyed
it
complacently
there
i
think
that
is
bright
enough
even
to
suit
margaret
graham
i
shall
take
over
the
whole
two
dozen
teas
and
one
dozen
desserts
i
wish
bertha
that
you
would
tie
a
red
cord
around
each
of
the
handles
for
me
the
carmody
spoons
are
the
same
pattern
and
i
shall
always
be
convinced
that
carmody
carried
off
two
of
ours
the
time
that
jenny
graham
was
married
i
do
mean
to
take
any
more
risks
and
father
something
made
the
mother
look
around
and
she
saw
her
when
the
commotion
was
over
selwyn
asked
why
the
family
spoons
were
being
rubbed
up
for
the
wedding
of
course
said
grant
polishing
her
spectacles
and
deciding
that
there
was
no
more
time
for
tears
and
sentiment
just
then
and
there
they
not
half
done
and
we
have
to
dress
in
another
hour
bertha
is
no
earthly
use
she
is
so
taken
up
with
her
bridesmaid

whose
wedding
demanded
selwyn
in
bewilderment
why

to

invitation

that
what

out
some
between
ten
and
twenty

grows
up
why
sel
you
grey
around
your
temples
too
well

but
a
man
own
brother
should
be
the
first
to
cast
such
things
up
to
him
i
admit
since
i
come
to
think
of
it
that
alice

probably
grown
bigger

she
any
than
she
used
to
be
alice

a
charming
girl

impressively

also
sweet
and
sensible
which
beauties

not

much

grant
father

selwyn
away
so
that
i
sha
be
tempted
to
waste
time

to
him
in
the
library

and
son
looked
at
each
other
affectionately
dad
it
a
blessing
to

the
same
i
a
little
dizzy
with
all
these
changes
bertha
grown
up
and
leo
within
an
inch
of
being
married
to
alice
graham
at
that
whom
i
ca
think
of
yet
as
anything
else
than
the
imp
of
mischief
she
was
when
a
kiddy
to
tell
you
the
truth
dad
i
do
feel
in
a
mood
for
going
to
a
wedding
at
tonight
i
sure
you
either
you
always
hated
fusses
ca
we
shirk
it
they
smiled
at
each
other
with
chummy
remembrance
of
many
a
family
festival
they
had
shirked
together
in
the
old
days
but
grant
shook
his
head
not
this
time
sonny
there
are
some
things
a
decent
man
ca
shirk
and
one
of
them
is
his
own
boy
wedding
it
a
nuisance
but
i
must
go
through
with
it
you
understand
how
it
is
when
you
a
family
man
yourself
by
the
way
why
are
you
a
family
man
by
this
time
why
have
i
been
put
to
the
bother
and
inconvenience
of
attending
your
wedding
before
now
son
selwyn
laughed
with
a
little
vibrant
note
of
bitterness
in
the
laughter
which
the
father
quick
ears
detected
i
been
too
busy
with
law
books
dad
to
find
me
a
wife
grant
shook
his
bushy
grey
head
that
not
the
real
reason
son
the
world
has
a
wife
for
every
man
if
he
has
found
her
by
the
time
he
there
some
real
reason
for
it
well
i
do
want
to
pry
into
yours
but
i
hope
it
a
sound
one
and
not
a
mean
sneaking
selfish
sort
of
reason
perhaps
you
choose
a
madam
selwyn
some
day
yet
in
case
you
should
i
going
to
give
you
a
small
bit
of
good
advice
your
mother
now
she
a
splendid
woman
selwyn
a
splendid
woman
she
ca
be
matched
as
a
housekeeper
and
she
has
improved
my
finances
until
i
do
know
them
when
i
meet
them
been
a
good
wife
and
a
good
mother
if
i
were
a
young
man
i
court
her
and
marry
her
over
again
that
i
would
but
son
when
pick
a
wife
pick
one
with
a
nice
little
commonplace
nose
not
a
family
nose
never
marry
a
woman
with
a
family
nose
son
a
woman
with
a
family
nose
came
into
the
library
at
this
juncture
and
beamed
maternally
upon
them
both
there
a
bite
for
you
in
the
dining
room
after
you
eaten
it
you
must
dress
mind
you
brush
your
hair
well
down
father
the
green
room
is
ready
for
you
selwyn
tomorrow

a
good
talk
with

but
tonight
i
be
too
busy
to
remember
you
around
how
are
we
all
going
to
get
over
to
leo
and
bertha
are
going
in
the
pony
carriage
it
hold
a
third
passenger

have
to
squeeze
in
with
father
and
me
in
the
buggy
selwyn
by
no
means
replied
selwyn
briskly
i
walk
over
to
ifs
only
half
a
mile
across
lots
i
suppose
the
old
way
is
still
open
it
ought
to
be
answered
grant
drily
leo
has
kept
it
well
trodden
if
you
forgotten
how
it
runs
he
can
tell
you
i
have
forgotten
said
selwyn
a
little
brusquely
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
remembering
the
wood
path
leo
had
not
been
the
first
grant
to
go
courting
to
when
he
started
the
moon
was
rising
round
and
red
and
hazy
in
an
eastern
the
autumn
air
was
mild
and
spicy
long
shadows
stretched
across
the
fields
on
his
right
and
silvery
mosaics
patterned
the
floor
of
the
old
beechwood
lane
selwyn
walked
slowly
he
was
thinking
of
esme
graham
or
rather
of
the
girl
who
had
been
esme
graham
and
wondering
if
he
would
see
her
at
the
wedding
it
was
probable
and
he
did
not
want
to
see
her
in
spite
of
ten
effort
he
did
not
think
he
could
yet
look
upon
tom
clair
wife
with
the
proper
calm
indifference
at
the
best
it
would
taint
his
own
memory
of
her
he
would
never
again
be
able
to
think
of
her
as
esme
graham
but
only
as
esme
clair
the
grahams
had
come
to
eleven
years
before
there
was
a
big
family
of
girls
of
whom
the
tall
esme
was
the
oldest
there
was
one
summer
during
which
selwyn
grant
had
haunted
the
merry
comrade
of
the
younger
girls
the
boyishly
silently
devoted
lover
of
esme
tom
clair
had
always
been
there
too
in
his
right
as
second
cousin
selwyn
had
supposed
one
day
he
found
out
that
tom
and
esme
had
been
engaged
ever
since
she
was
sixteen
one
of
her
sisters
told
him
that
had
been
all
he
had
gone
away
soon
after
and
some
time
later
a
letter
from
home
made
casual
mention
of
tom
clair
marriage
he
narrowly
missed
being
late
for
the
wedding
ceremony
the
bridal
party
entered
the
parlour
at
at
the
same
moment
as
he
slipped
in
by
another
door
selwyn
almost
whistled
with
amazement
at
sight
of
the
bride
alice
graham
that
tall
stately
blushing
young
woman
with
her
masses
of
hair
frosted
over
by
the
film
of
wedding
veil
could
that
be
the
scrawny
little
tomboy
of
ten
years
ago
she
looked
not
unlike
esme
with
that
subtle
family
resemblance
that
is
quite
independent
of
feature
and
colouring
where
was
esme
selwyn
cast
his
eyes
furtively
over
the
assembled
guests
while
the
minister
read
the
marriage
ceremony
he
recognized
several
of
the
graham
girls
but
he
did
not
see
esme
although
tom
clair
stout
and
florid
and
was
standing
on
a
chair
in
a
faraway
corner
peering
over
the
heads
of
the
women
after
the
turmoil
of
handshakings
and
congratulations
selwyn
fled
to
the
cool
still
outdoors
where
the
rosy
glow
of
chinese
lanterns
mingled
with
the
waves
of
moonshine
to
make
fairyland
and
there
he
met
her
as
she
came
out
of
the
house
by
a
side
door
a
tall
slender
woman
in
some
glistening
clinging
garment
with
white
flowers
shining
like
stars
in
the
coils
of
her
brown
hair
in
the
soft
glow
she
looked
even
more
beautiful
than
in
the
days
of
her
girlhood
and
heart
throbbed
dangerously
at
sight
of
her
esme
he
said
involuntarily
she
started
and
he
had
an
idea
that
she
changed
colour
although
it
was
too
dim
to
be
sure
selwyn
she
exclaimed
putting
out
her
hands
why
selwyn
grant
is
it
really
you
or
are
you
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
i
did
not
know
you
were
here
i
did
not
know
you
were
home
he
caught
her
hands
and
held
them
tightly
drawing
her
a
little
closer
to
him
forgetting
that
she
was
tom
clair
wife
remembering
only
that
she
was
the
woman
to
whom
he
had
given
all
his
love
and
devotion
to
the
entire
beggaring
of
his
heart
i
reached
home
only
four
hours
ago
and
was
haled
straightway
here
to
leo
wedding
i
dizzy
esme
i
ca
adjust
my
old
conceptions
to
this
new
state
of
affairs
all
at
once
it
seems
ridiculous
to
think
that
leo
and
alice
are
married
i
sure
they
ca
be
really
grown
up
esme
laughed
as
she
drew
away
her
hands
we
are
all
ten
years
older
she
said
lightly
not
you
you
are
more
beautiful
than
ever
esme
that
sunflower
compliment
is
permissible
in
an
old
friend
is
it
this
mellow
glow
is
kinder
to
me
than
sunlight
now
i
am
thirty
you
know
selwyn
and
i
have
some
grey
hairs
he
confessed
i
knew
i
had
them
but
i
had
a
sneaking
hope
that
other
folks
did
until
leo
destroyed
it
today
these
young
brothers
and
sisters
who
wo
stay
children
are
nuisances
you
be
telling
me
next
thing
that
is
grown
up
is
eighteen
and
has
a
beau
laughed
esme
and
i
give
you
fair
warning
that
she
insists
on
being
called
laura
now
do
you
want
to
come
for
a
walk
with
me
down
under
the
beeches
to
the
old
lane
gate
i
came
out
to
see
if
the
fresh
air
would
do
my
bit
of
a
headache
good
i
shall
have
to
help
with
the
supper
later
on
they
went
slowly
across
the
lawn
and
turned
into
a
dim
moonlight
lane
beyond
their
old
favourite
ramble
selwyn
felt
like
a
man
in
a
dream
a
pleasant
dream
from
which
he
dreads
to
awaken
the
voices
and
laughter
echoing
out
from
the
house
died
away
behind
them
and
the
great
silence
of
the
night
fell
about
them
as
they
came
to
the
old
gate
beyond
which
was
a
range
of
shining
fields
for
a
little
while
neither
of
them
spoke
the
woman
looked
out
across
the
white
spaces
and
the
man
watched
the
glimmering
curve
of
her
neck
and
the
soft
darkness
of
her
rich
hair
how
virginal
how
sacred
she
looked
the
thought
of
tom
clair
was
a
sacrilege
it
nice
to
see
you
again
selwyn
said
esme
frankly
at
last
there
are
so
few
of
our
old
set
left
and
so
many
of
the
babies
grown
up
sometimes
i
do
know
my
own
world
it
has
changed
so
it
an
uncomfortable
feeling
you
give
me
a
pleasant
sensation
of
really
belonging
here
i
be
lonesome
tonight
if
i
dared
i
going
to
miss
alice
so
much
there
will
be
only
mother
and
baby
and
i
left
now
our
family
circle
has
dwindled
woefully
mother
and
baby
and
you
selwyn
felt
his
head
whirling
again
why
where
is
tom
he
felt
that
it
was
an
idiotic
question
but
it
slipped
from
his
tongue
before
he
could
catch
it
esme
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
wonderingly
he
knew
that
in
the
sunlight
her
eyes
were
as
mistily
blue
as
early
meadow
violets
but
here
they
looked
dark
and
unfathomably
tender
tom
she
said
perplexedly
do
you
mean
tom
clair
he
is
here
of
course
he
and
his
wife
did
you
see
her
that
pretty
woman
in
pale
pink
lil
meredith
why
you
used
to
know
lil
did
you
one
of
the
uxbridge
merediths
to
the
day
of
his
death
selwyn
grant
will
firmly
believe
that
if
he
had
not
clutched
fast
hold
of
the
top
bar
of
the
gate
he
would
have
tumbled
down
on
the
moss
under
the
beeches
in
speechless
astonishment
all
the
surprises
of
that
surprising
evening
were
as
nothing
to
this
he
had
a
swift
conviction
that
there
were
no
words
in
the
english
language
that
could
fully
express
his
feelings
and
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time
to
try
to
find
any
therefore
he
laid
hold
of
the
first
baldly
commonplace
ones
that
came
handy
and
said
tamely
i
thought
you
were
married
to
tom
you
thought
i
was
married
to
tom
repeated
esme
slowly
and
have
you
thought
all
these
years
selwyn
grant
yes
i
have
is
it
any
wonder
you
were
engaged
to
tom
when
i
went
away
jenny
told
me
you
were
and
a
year
later
bertha
wrote
me
a
letter
in
which
she
made
some
reference
to
tom
marriage
she
say
to
but
had
i
the
right
to
suppose
it
was
to
you
oh
the
word
was
partly
a
sigh
and
partly
a
little
cry
of
pain
it
been
all
a
funny
misunderstanding
tom
and
i
engaged
once
a
affair
in
the
beginning
then
we
both
found
out
that
we
had
made
a
mistake
that
what
we
had
thought
was
love
was
merely
the
affection
of
good
comrades
we
broke
our
engagement
shortly
before
you
went
away
all
the
older
girls
knew
it
was
broken
but
i
suppose
nobody
mentioned
the
matter
to
jen
she
was
such
a
child
we
never
thought
about
her
and
you
thought
i
was
tom
wife
all
this
time
it
funny
funny
you
mean
tragic
look
here
esme
i
not
going
to
risk
any
more
misunderstanding
there
nothing
for
it
but
plain
talk
when
matters
get
to
such
a
state
as
this
i
love
you
and
i
loved
you
ever
since
i
met
you
i
went
away
because
i
could
not
stay
here
and
see
you
married
to
another
man
i
stayed
away
for
the
same
reason
esme
is
it
too
late
did
you
ever
care
anything
for
me
yes
i
did
she
said
slowly
do
you
care
still
he
asked
she
hid
her
face
against
his
shoulder
yes
she
whispered
then
we
go
back
to
the
house
and
be
married
he
said
joyfully
esme
broke
away
and
stared
at
him
married
yes
married
we
wasted
ten
years
and
we
not
going
to
waste
another
minute
we
i
say
selwyn
it
impossible
i
have
expurgated
that
word
from
my
dictionary
it
the
very
simplest
thing
when
you
look
at
it
in
an
unprejudiced
way
here
is
a
wedding
and
decorations
and
assembled
guests
a
minister
on
the
spot
and
a
state
where
no
licence
is
required
you
have
a
very
pretty
new
dress
on
and
you
love
me
i
have
a
plain
gold
ring
on
my
little
finger
that
will
fit
you
are
all
the
conditions
fulfilled
where
is
the
sense
of
waiting
and
having
another
family
upheaval
in
a
few
weeks
time
i
understand
why
you
have
made
such
a
success
of
the
law
said
esme
but
there
are
no
buts
come
with
me
esme
i
going
to
hunt
up
your
mother
and
mine
and
talk
to
them
half
an
hour
later
an
astonishing
whisper
went
circulating
among
the
guests
before
they
could
grasp
its
significance
tom
clair
and
jen
husband
broadly
smiling
were
hustling
scattered
folk
into
the
parlour
again
and
making
clear
a
passage
in
the
hall
the
minister
came
in
with
his
blue
book
and
then
selwyn
grant
and
esme
graham
walked
in
hand
in
hand
when
the
second
ceremony
was
over
grant
shook
his
son
hand
vigorously
there
no
need
to
wish
you
happiness
son
you
got
it
and
you
made
one
fuss
and
bother
do
for
both
weddings
what
i
call
genius
and
this
in
a
careful
whisper
while
esme
was
temporarily
obliterated
in
grant
capacious
embrace
she
got
the
right
sort
of
a
nose
but
your
mother
is
a
grand
woman
son
a
grand
woman
at
the
bay
shore
farm
the
newburys
were
agog
with
excitement
over
the
governor
picnic
as
they
talked
it
over
on
the
verandah
at
sunset
they
felt
that
life
could
not
be
worth
living
to
those
unfortunate
people
who
had
not
been
invited
to
it
not
that
there
were
many
of
the
latter
in
claymont
for
it
was
the
governor
native
village
and
the
claymonters
were
getting
up
the
picnic
for
him
during
his
political
visit
to
the
city
fifteen
miles
away
each
of
the
newburys
had
a
special
reason
for
wishing
to
attend
the
governor
picnic
ralph
and
elliott
wanted
to
see
the
governor
himself
he
was
a
pet
hero
of
theirs
had
he
not
once
been
a
claymont
lad
just
like
themselves
had
he
not
risen
to
the
highest
office
in
the
state
by
dint
of
sheer
hard
work
and
persistency
had
he
not
won
a
national
reputation
by
his
prompt
and
decisive
measures
during
the
big
strike
at
campden
and
was
he
not
a
man
personally
and
politically
whom
any
boy
might
be
proud
to
imitate
yes
to
all
of
these
questions
hence
to
the
newbury
boys
the
interest
of
the
picnic
centred
in
the
governor
i
shall
feel
two
inches
taller
just
to
get
a
look
at
him
said
ralph
enthusiastically
he
is
much
to
look
at
said
frances
rather
patronizingly
i
saw
him
once
at
campden
he
came
to
the
school
when
his
daughter
was
graduated
he
is
bald
and
fat
oh
of
course
he
is
famous
and
all
that
but
i
want
to
go
to
the
picnic
to
see
sara
beaumont
she
to
be
there
with
the
chandlers
from
campden
and
mary
spearman
who
knows
her
by
sight
is
going
to
point
her
out
to
me
i
suppose
it
would
be
too
much
to
expect
to
be
introduced
to
her
i
shall
probably
have
to
content
myself
with
just
looking
at
her
ralph
resented
hearing
the
governor
called
bald
and
fat
somehow
it
seemed
as
if
his
hero
were
being
reduced
to
the
level
of
common
clay
that
like
a
girl
he
said
loftily
thinking
more
about
a
woman
who
writes
books
than
about
a
man
like
the
governor
i
rather
see
sara
beaumont
than
forty
governors
retorted
frances
why
she
famous
and
her
books
are
perfect
if
i
could
ever
hope
to
write
anything
like
them
it
been
the
dream
of
my
life
just
to
see
her
ever
since
i
read
story
of
and
now
to
think
that
it
is
to
be
fulfilled
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
that
tomorrow
tomorrow
newburys
i
shall
see
sara
beaumont
well
said
cecilia
gently
cecilia
was
always
gentle
even
in
her
enthusiasm
i
shall
like
to
see
the
governor
and
sara
beaumont
too
but
i
going
to
the
picnic
more
for
the
sake
of
seeing
nan
harris
than
anything
else
it
three
years
since
she
went
away
you
know
and
i
never
had
another
chum
whom
i
love
so
dearly
i
just
looking
forward
to
meeting
her
and
talking
over
all
our
dear
good
old
times
i
do
wonder
if
she
has
changed
much
but
i
am
sure
i
shall
know
her
by
her
red
hair
and
her
freckles
questioned
elliott
teasingly
they
be
the
same
as
ever
i
be
bound
cecilia
flushed
and
looked
as
angry
as
she
could
which
is
saying
much
after
all
she
did
mind
when
elliott
teased
her
about
her
pug
nose
and
her
big
mouth
but
it
always
hurt
her
when
he
made
fun
of
nan
nan
family
had
once
lived
across
the
street
from
the
newburys
nan
and
cecilia
had
been
playmates
all
through
childhood
but
when
both
girls
were
fourteen
the
harrises
had
moved
out
west
cecilia
had
never
seen
nan
since
but
now
the
latter
had
come
east
for
a
visit
and
was
with
her
relatives
in
campden
she
was
to
be
at
the
picnic
and
cecilia
cup
of
delight
brimmed
over
newbury
came
briskly
into
the
middle
of
their
sunset
plans
she
had
been
down
to
the
post
office
and
she
carried
an
open
letter
in
her
hand
mother
said
frances
straightening
up
anxiously
you
have
a
pitying
expression
on
your
face
which
of
us
is
it
for
speak
out
do
keep
us
in
suspense
has
mary
spearman
told
you
that
sara
beaumont
is
going
to
be
at
the
picnic
or
that
the
governor
is
going
to
be
there
or
that
nan
harris
is
coming
or
that
something
happened
to
put
off
the
affair
altogether
cried
ralph
and
cecilia
and
elliott
all
at
once
newbury
laughed
no
it
none
of
those
things
and
i
do
know
just
whom
i
do
pity
but
it
is
one
of
you
girls
this
is
a
letter
from
grandmother
newbury
tomorrow
is
her
birthday
and
she
wants
either
frances
or
cecilia
to
go
out
to
ashland
on
the
early
morning
train
and
spend
the
day
at
the
bay
shore
farm
there
was
silence
on
the
verandah
of
the
newburys
for
the
space
of
ten
seconds
then
frances
burst
out
with
mother
you
know
neither
of
us
can
go
tomorrow
if
it
were
any
other
day
but
the
day
of
the
picnic
i
sorry
but
one
of
you
must
go
said
newbury
firmly
your
father
said
so
when
i
called
at
the
store
to
show
him
the
letter
grandmother
newbury
would
be
very
much
hurt
and
displeased
if
her
invitation
were
disregarded
you
know
that
but
we
leave
it
to
yourselves
to
decide
which
one
shall
go
do
do
that
implored
frances
miserably
pick
one
of
us
yourself
pull
straws
anything
to
shorten
the
agony
no
you
must
settle
it
for
yourselves
said
newbury
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
looked
at
cecilia
cecilia
was
apt
to
be
looked
at
someway
when
things
were
to
be
given
up
mostly
it
was
cecilia
who
gave
them
up
the
family
had
come
to
expect
it
of
her
they
all
said
that
cecilia
was
very
unselfish
cecilia
knew
that
her
mother
looked
at
her
but
did
not
turn
her
face
she
could
just
then
she
looked
away
out
over
the
hills
and
tried
to
swallow
something
that
came
up
in
her
throat
glad
i
not
a
girl
said
ralph
when
newbury
had
gone
into
the
house
whew
nothing
could
induce
me
to
give
up
that
picnic
not
if
a
dozen
grandmother
newburys
were
offended
where
your
sparkle
gone
now
fran
it
too
bad
of
grandmother
newbury
declared
frances
angrily
oh
fran
she
did
know
about
the
picnic
said
cecilia
but
still
without
turning
round
well
she
need
always
be
so
annoyed
if
we
do
go
when
we
are
invited
another
day
would
do
just
as
well
said
frances
shortly
something
in
her
voice
sounded
choked
too
she
rose
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
verandah
where
she
stood
and
scowled
down
the
road
ralph
and
elliott
feeling
uncomfortable
went
away
the
verandah
was
very
still
for
a
little
while
the
sun
had
quite
set
and
it
was
growing
dark
when
frances
came
back
to
the
steps
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
she
said
shortly
which
of
us
is
to
go
to
the
bay
shore
i
suppose
i
had
better
go
said
cecilia
slowly
very
slowly
indeed
frances
kicked
her
slippered
toe
against
the
fern
you
may
see
nan
harris
somewhere
else
before
she
goes
back
she
said
consolingly
yes
i
may
said
cecilia
she
knew
quite
well
that
she
would
not
nan
would
return
to
campden
on
the
special
train
and
she
was
going
back
west
in
three
days
it
was
hard
to
give
the
picnic
up
but
cecilia
was
used
to
giving
things
up
nobody
ever
expected
frances
to
give
things
up
she
was
so
brilliant
and
popular
that
the
good
things
of
life
came
her
way
naturally
it
never
seemed
to
matter
so
much
about
quiet
cecilia
cecilia
cried
herself
to
sleep
that
night
she
felt
that
it
was
horribly
selfish
of
her
to
do
so
but
she
could
help
it
she
awoke
in
the
morning
with
a
confused
idea
that
it
was
very
late
why
mary
called
her
as
she
had
been
told
to
do
through
the
open
door
between
her
room
and
frances
she
could
see
that
the
latter
bed
was
empty
then
she
saw
a
little
note
addressed
to
her
pinned
on
the
pillow
dear
saint
cecilia
it
ran
when
you
read
this
i
shall
be
on
the
train
to
ashland
to
spend
the
day
with
grandmother
newbury
you
been
giving
up
things
so
often
and
so
long
that
i
suppose
you
think
you
have
a
monopoly
of
it
but
you
see
you
have
i
did
tell
you
this
last
night
because
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
but
after
you
went
upstairs
i
fought
it
out
to
a
finish
and
came
to
a
decision
sara
beaumont
would
keep
but
nan
harris
would
so
you
must
go
to
the
picnic
i
told
mary
to
call
me
instead
of
you
this
morning
and
now
i
off
you
need
spoil
your
fun
pitying
me
now
that
the
wrench
is
over
i
feel
a
most
delightful
glow
of
virtuous
satisfaction
fran
if
by
running
after
frances
cecilia
could
have
brought
her
back
cecilia
would
have
run
but
a
glance
at
her
watch
told
her
that
frances
must
already
be
halfway
to
ashland
so
she
could
only
accept
the
situation
well
anyway
she
thought
i
get
mary
to
point
sara
beaumont
out
to
me
and
i
store
up
a
description
of
her
in
my
mind
to
tell
fran
tonight
i
must
remember
to
take
notice
of
the
colour
of
her
eyes
fran
has
always
been
exercised
about
that
it
was
when
frances
arrived
at
ashland
station
grandmother
newbury
man
hiram
was
waiting
for
her
with
the
pony
carriage
and
frances
heartily
enjoyed
the
drive
to
the
bay
shore
farm
grandmother
newbury
came
to
the
door
to
meet
her
granddaughter
she
was
a
tall
handsome
old
lady
with
piercing
black
eyes
and
thick
white
hair
there
was
no
savour
of
the
traditional
grandmother
of
caps
and
knitting
about
her
she
was
like
a
stately
old
princess
and
much
as
her
grandchildren
admired
her
they
were
decidedly
in
awe
of
her
so
it
is
frances
she
said
bending
her
head
graciously
that
frances
might
kiss
her
still
rosy
cheek
i
expected
it
would
be
cecilia
i
heard
after
i
had
written
you
that
there
was
to
be
a
gubernatorial
picnic
in
claymont
today
so
i
was
quite
sure
it
would
be
cecilia
why
is
it
cecilia
frances
flushed
a
little
there
was
a
meaning
tone
in
grandmother
newbury
voice
cecilia
was
very
anxious
to
go
to
the
picnic
today
to
see
an
old
friend
of
hers
she
answered
she
was
willing
to
come
here
but
you
know
grandmother
that
cecilia
is
always
willing
to
do
the
things
somebody
else
ought
to
do
so
i
decided
i
would
stand
on
my
rights
as
newbury
for
once
and
come
to
the
bay
shore
grandmother
newbury
smiled
she
understood
frances
had
always
been
her
favourite
granddaughter
but
she
had
never
been
blind
old
lady
that
she
was
to
the
little
leaven
of
selfishness
in
the
girl
nature
she
was
pleased
to
see
that
frances
had
conquered
it
this
time
i
glad
it
is
you
who
have
come
principally
because
you
are
cleverer
than
cecilia
she
said
brusquely
or
at
least
you
are
the
better
talker
and
i
want
a
clever
girl
and
a
good
talker
to
help
me
entertain
a
guest
today
she
clever
herself
and
she
likes
young
girls
she
is
a
particular
friend
of
your
uncle
robert
family
down
south
and
that
is
why
i
have
asked
her
to
spend
a
few
days
with
me
you
like
her
here
grandmother
newbury
led
frances
into
the
kennedy
this
is
my
granddaughter
frances
newbury
i
told
you
about
her
and
her
ambitions
last
night
you
see
frances
we
have
talked
you
over
kennedy
was
a
much
younger
woman
than
grandmother
newbury
she
was
certainly
no
more
than
fifty
and
in
spite
of
her
grey
hair
looked
almost
girlish
so
bright
were
her
dark
eyes
so
and
fresh
her
delicate
face
and
so
smart
her
general
appearance
frances
although
not
given
to
sudden
likings
took
one
for
kennedy
she
thought
she
had
never
seen
so
charming
a
face
she
found
herself
enjoying
the
day
immensely
in
fact
she
forgot
the
governor
picnic
and
sara
beaumont
altogether
kennedy
proved
to
be
a
delightful
companion
she
had
travelled
extensively
and
was
an
excellent
she
had
seen
much
of
men
and
women
and
crystallized
her
experiences
into
sparkling
little
sentences
and
epigrams
which
made
frances
feel
as
if
she
were
listening
to
one
of
the
witty
people
in
clever
books
but
under
all
her
sparkling
wit
there
was
a
strongly
felt
undercurrent
of
true
womanly
sympathy
and
which
won
affection
as
speedily
as
her
brilliance
won
admiration
frances
listened
and
laughed
and
enjoyed
once
she
found
time
to
think
that
she
would
have
missed
a
great
deal
if
she
had
not
come
to
bay
shore
farm
that
day
surely
talking
to
a
woman
like
kennedy
was
better
than
looking
at
sara
beaumont
from
a
distance
i
been
in
the
most
approved
storybook
style
she
thought
with
amusement
in
the
afternoon
grandmother
newbury
packed
kennedy
and
frances
off
for
a
walk
the
old
woman
wants
to
have
her
regular
nap
she
told
them
frances
take
kennedy
to
the
fern
walk
and
show
her
the
famous
bubble
among
the
rocks
i
want
to
be
rid
of
you
both
until
frances
and
kennedy
went
to
the
fern
walk
and
the
beautiful
bubble
a
clear
round
spring
of
water
set
down
in
a
cup
of
rock
overhung
with
ferns
and
beeches
it
was
a
spot
frances
had
always
loved
she
found
herself
talking
freely
to
kennedy
of
her
hopes
and
plans
the
older
woman
drew
the
girl
out
with
tactful
sympathy
until
she
found
that
frances
dearest
ambition
was
some
day
to
be
a
writer
of
books
like
sara
beaumont
not
that
i
expect
ever
to
write
books
like
hers
she
said
hurriedly
and
i
know
it
must
be
a
long
while
before
i
can
write
anything
worth
while
at
all
but
do
you
think
if
i
try
hard
and
work
hard
that
i
might
do
something
in
this
line
some
day
i
think
so
said
kennedy
smiling
if
as
you
say
you
are
willing
to
work
hard
and
study
hard
there
will
be
a
great
deal
of
both
and
many
disappointments
sara
beaumont
herself
had
a
hard
time
at
first
and
for
a
very
long
first
too
her
family
was
poor
you
know
and
sara
earned
enough
money
to
send
away
her
first
manuscripts
by
making
a
pot
of
jelly
for
a
neighbour
the
manuscripts
came
back
and
sara
made
more
jelly
and
wrote
more
stories
still
they
came
back
once
she
thought
she
had
better
give
up
writing
stories
and
stick
to
the
jelly
alone
there
did
seem
some
little
demand
for
the
one
and
none
at
all
for
the
other
but
she
determined
to
keep
on
until
she
either
succeeded
or
proved
to
her
own
satisfaction
that
she
could
make
better
jelly
than
stories
and
you
see
she
did
succeed
but
it
means
perseverance
and
patience
and
much
hard
work
prepare
yourself
for
that
frances
and
one
day
you
will
win
your
place
then
you
will
look
back
to
the
bubble
and
you
will
tell
me
what
a
good
prophetess
i
was
they
talked
longer
an
earnest
helpful
talk
that
went
far
to
inspire
frances
hazy
ambition
with
a
definite
purpose
she
understood
that
she
must
not
write
merely
to
win
fame
for
herself
or
even
for
the
higher
motive
of
pure
pleasure
in
her
work
she
must
aim
however
humbly
to
help
her
readers
to
higher
planes
of
thought
and
endeavour
then
and
only
then
would
it
be
worth
while
kennedy
is
going
to
drive
you
to
the
station
said
grandmother
newbury
after
tea
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
frances
for
giving
up
the
picnic
today
and
coming
to
the
bay
shore
to
gratify
an
old
inconvenient
whim
but
i
shall
not
burden
you
with
too
much
gratitude
for
i
think
you
have
enjoyed
yourself
indeed
i
have
said
frances
heartily
then
she
added
with
a
laugh
i
think
i
would
feel
much
more
meritorious
if
it
had
not
been
so
pleasant
it
has
robbed
me
of
all
the
complacency
i
felt
this
morning
you
see
i
wanted
to
go
to
that
picnic
to
see
sara
beaumont
and
i
felt
quite
like
a
martyr
at
giving
it
up
grandmother
newbury
eyes
twinkled
you
would
have
been
beautifully
disappointed
had
you
gone
sara
beaumont
was
not
there
kennedy
i
see
you
have
told
our
secret
frances
my
dear
let
me
introduce
you
two
over
again
this
lady
is
sara
beaumont
kennedy
the
writer
of
story
of
and
all
those
other
books
you
so
much
admire
the
newburys
were
sitting
on
the
verandah
at
dusk
too
tired
and
too
happy
to
talk
ralph
and
elliott
had
seen
the
governor
more
than
that
they
had
been
introduced
to
him
and
he
had
shaken
hands
with
them
both
and
told
them
that
their
father
and
he
had
been
chums
when
just
their
size
and
cecilia
had
spent
a
whole
day
with
nan
harris
who
had
not
changed
at
all
except
to
grow
taller
but
there
was
one
little
cloud
on
her
content
i
wanted
to
see
sara
beaumont
to
tell
frances
about
her
but
i
could
get
a
glimpse
of
her
i
do
even
know
if
she
was
there
there
comes
fran
up
the
station
road
now
said
ralph
my
eyes
has
she
a
step
frances
came
smiling
over
the
lawn
and
up
the
steps
so
you
are
all
home
safe
she
said
gaily
i
hope
you
feasted
your
eyes
on
your
beloved
governor
boys
i
can
tell
that
cecilia
forgathered
with
nan
by
the
beatific
look
on
her
face
oh
fran
it
was
lovely
cried
cecilia
but
i
felt
so
sorry
why
did
you
let
me
go
to
ashland
it
was
too
bad
you
missed
it
and
sara
beaumont
sara
beaumont
was
at
the
bay
shore
farm
said
frances
i
tell
you
all
about
it
when
i
get
my
breath
i
been
breathless
ever
since
grandmother
newbury
told
me
of
it
there
only
one
drawback
to
my
supreme
bliss
the
remembrance
of
how
complacently
i
felt
this
morning
it
humiliates
me
wholesomely
to
remember
it
elizabeth
child
the
ingelows
of
ingelow
grange
were
not
a
marrying
family
only
one
of
them
elizabeth
had
married
and
perhaps
it
was
her
poor
match
that
discouraged
the
others
at
any
rate
ellen
and
charlotte
and
george
ingelow
at
the
grange
were
single
and
so
was
paul
down
at
greenwood
farm
it
was
seventeen
years
since
elizabeth
had
married
james
sheldon
in
the
face
of
the
most
decided
opposition
on
the
part
of
her
family
sheldon
was
a
handsome
shiftless
without
any
violent
bad
habits
but
also
without
any
backbone
as
the
ingelows
declared
there
is
sometimes
hope
of
a
man
who
is
actively
bad
charlotte
ingelow
had
said
sententiously
but
who
ever
heard
of
reforming
a
jellyfish
elizabeth
and
her
husband
had
gone
west
and
settled
on
a
prairie
farm
in
manitoba
she
had
never
been
home
since
perhaps
her
pride
kept
her
away
for
she
had
the
ingelow
share
of
that
and
she
soon
discovered
that
her
family
estimate
of
james
sheldon
had
been
the
true
one
there
was
no
active
resentment
on
either
side
and
once
in
a
long
while
letters
were
exchanged
still
ever
since
her
marriage
elizabeth
had
been
practically
an
outsider
and
an
alien
as
the
years
came
and
went
the
ingelows
at
home
remembered
only
at
long
intervals
that
they
had
a
sister
on
the
western
prairies
one
of
these
remembrances
came
to
charlotte
ingelow
on
a
spring
afternoon
when
the
great
orchards
about
the
grange
were
pink
and
white
with
apple
and
cherry
blossoms
and
over
every
hill
and
field
was
a
delicate
green
a
soft
breeze
was
blowing
loose
petals
from
the
august
sweeting
through
the
open
door
of
the
wide
hall
when
charlotte
came
through
it
ellen
and
george
were
standing
on
the
steps
outside
this
kind
of
a
day
always
makes
me
think
of
elizabeth
said
charlotte
dreamily
it
was
in
time
she
went
away
the
ingelows
always
spoke
of
elizabeth
going
away
never
of
her
marrying
seventeen
years
ago
said
ellen
why
elizabeth
oldest
child
must
be
quite
a
young
woman
now
i
i
a
sudden
idea
swept
over
and
left
her
a
little
breathless
i
would
really
like
to
see
her
then
why
do
you
write
and
ask
her
to
come
east
and
visit
us
asked
george
who
did
not
often
speak
but
who
always
spoke
to
some
purpose
when
he
did
ellen
and
charlotte
looked
at
each
other
i
would
like
to
see
elizabeth
child
repeated
ellen
firmly
do
you
think
she
would
come
asked
charlotte
you
know
when
james
sheldon
died
five
years
ago
we
wrote
to
elizabeth
and
asked
her
to
come
home
and
live
with
us
and
she
seemed
almost
resentful
in
the
letter
she
wrote
back
i
never
said
so
before
but
i
often
thought
it
yes
she
did
said
ellen
who
had
often
thought
so
too
but
never
said
so
elizabeth
was
always
very
independent
remarked
george
perhaps
she
thought
your
letter
savoured
of
charity
or
pity
no
ingelow
would
endure
that
at
any
rate
you
know
she
refused
to
come
even
for
a
visit
she
said
she
could
not
leave
the
farm
she
may
refuse
to
let
her
child
come
it
wo
do
any
harm
to
ask
her
said
george
in
the
end
charlotte
wrote
to
elizabeth
and
asked
her
to
let
her
daughter
visit
the
old
homestead
the
letter
was
written
and
mailed
in
much
perplexity
and
distrust
when
once
the
glow
of
momentary
enthusiasm
in
the
new
idea
had
passed
what
if
elizabeth
child
is
like
her
father
queried
charlotte
in
a
let
us
hope
she
wo
be
cried
ellen
fervently
indeed
she
felt
that
a
feminine
edition
of
james
sheldon
would
be
more
than
she
could
endure
she
may
not
like
us
or
our
ways
sighed
charlotte
we
do
know
how
she
has
been
brought
up
she
will
seem
like
a
stranger
after
all
i
really
long
to
see
elizabeth
child
but
i
ca
help
fearing
we
have
done
a
rash
thing
ellen
perhaps
she
may
not
come
suggested
ellen
wondering
whether
she
hoped
it
or
feared
it
but
worth
sheldon
did
come
elizabeth
wrote
back
a
prompt
acceptance
with
no
trace
of
the
proud
bitterness
that
had
permeated
her
answer
to
the
former
invitation
the
ingelows
at
the
grange
were
thrown
into
a
flutter
when
the
letter
came
in
another
week
elizabeth
child
would
be
with
them
if
only
she
is
like
her
father
said
charlotte
with
foreboding
as
she
aired
and
swept
the
southeast
spare
room
for
their
expected
guest
they
had
three
spare
rooms
at
the
grange
but
the
aunts
had
selected
the
southeast
one
for
their
niece
because
it
was
done
in
white
and
white
seems
the
most
appropriate
for
a
young
girl
ellen
said
as
she
arranged
a
pitcher
of
wild
roses
on
the
table
i
think
everything
is
ready
announced
charlotte
i
put
the
very
finest
sheets
on
the
bed
they
smell
deliciously
of
lavender
and
we
had
very
good
luck
doing
up
the
muslin
curtains
it
is
pleasant
to
be
expecting
a
guest
is
it
ellen
i
have
often
thought
although
i
have
never
said
so
before
that
our
lives
were
too
we
seemed
to
have
no
interests
outside
of
ourselves
even
elizabeth
has
been
really
nothing
to
us
you
know
she
seemed
to
have
become
a
stranger
i
hope
her
child
will
be
the
means
of
bringing
us
nearer
together
again
if
she
has
james
sheldon
round
face
and
big
blue
eyes
and
curly
yellow
hair
i
shall
never
really
like
her
no
matter
how
ingelowish
she
may
be
inside
said
ellen
decidedly
when
worth
sheldon
came
each
of
her
aunts
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
worth
was
not
in
the
least
like
her
father
in
appearance
neither
did
she
resemble
her
mother
who
had
been
a
sprightly
and
girl
worth
was
tall
and
straight
with
a
long
braid
of
thick
wavy
brown
hair
large
grey
eyes
a
square
jaw
and
an
excellent
chin
with
a
dimple
in
it
she
is
the
very
image
of
mother
sister
aunt
alice
who
died
so
long
ago
said
charlotte
you
do
remember
her
ellen
but
i
do
very
well
she
was
the
sweetest
woman
that
ever
drew
breath
she
was
paul
favourite
aunt
too
charlotte
added
with
a
sigh
antagonistic
attitude
was
the
only
drawback
to
the
joy
of
this
meeting
how
delightful
it
would
have
been
if
he
had
not
refused
to
be
there
too
to
welcome
elizabeth
child
worth
came
to
hearts
prepared
to
love
her
but
they
must
have
loved
her
in
any
case
in
a
day
aunt
charlotte
and
aunt
ellen
and
shy
quiet
uncle
george
had
yielded
wholly
to
her
charm
she
was
girlishly
bright
and
merry
frankly
delighted
with
the
old
homestead
and
the
quaint
daintily
kept
rooms
yet
there
was
no
suggestion
of
gush
about
her
she
did
not
go
into
raptures
but
her
pleasure
shone
out
in
eyes
and
tones
there
was
so
much
to
tell
and
ask
and
remember
the
first
day
that
it
was
not
until
the
second
morning
after
her
arrival
that
worth
asked
the
question
her
aunts
had
been
dreading
she
asked
it
out
in
the
orchard
in
the
emerald
gloom
of
a
long
arcade
of
stout
old
trees
that
grandfather
ingelow
had
planted
fifty
years
ago
aunt
charlotte
when
is
uncle
paul
coming
up
to
see
me
i
long
to
see
him
mother
has
talked
so
much
to
me
about
him
she
was
his
favourite
sister
was
she
charlotte
and
ellen
looked
at
each
other
ellen
nodded
slyly
it
would
be
better
to
tell
worth
the
whole
truth
at
once
she
would
certainly
find
it
out
soon
i
do
not
think
my
dear
said
aunt
charlotte
quietly
that
your
uncle
paul
will
be
up
to
see
you
at
all
why
not
asked
worth
her
serious
grey
eyes
looking
straight
into
aunt
charlotte
troubled
dark
ones
aunt
charlotte
understood
that
elizabeth
had
never
told
worth
anything
about
her
family
resentment
of
her
marriage
it
was
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
to
explain
it
all
to
elizabeth
child
but
it
must
be
done
i
think
my
dear
she
said
gently
that
i
will
have
to
tell
you
a
little
bit
of
our
family
history
that
may
not
be
very
pleasant
to
hear
or
tell
perhaps
you
do
know
that
when
your
mother
married
we
we
did
not
exactly
approve
of
her
marriage
perhaps
we
were
mistaken
at
any
rate
it
was
wrong
and
foolish
to
let
it
come
between
us
and
her
as
we
have
done
but
that
is
how
it
was
none
of
us
approved
as
i
have
said
but
none
of
us
was
so
bitter
as
your
uncle
paul
your
mother
was
his
favourite
sister
and
he
was
very
deeply
attached
to
her
she
was
only
a
year
younger
than
he
when
he
bought
the
greenwood
farm
she
went
and
kept
house
for
him
for
three
years
before
her
marriage
when
she
married
paul
was
terribly
angry
he
was
always
a
strange
man
very
determined
and
unyielding
he
said
he
would
never
forgive
her
and
he
never
has
he
has
never
married
and
he
has
lived
so
long
alone
at
greenwood
with
only
deaf
old
bree
to
keep
house
for
him
that
he
has
grown
odder
than
ever
one
of
us
wanted
to
go
and
keep
house
for
him
but
he
would
not
let
us
and
i
must
tell
you
this
although
i
hate
to
he
was
very
angry
when
he
heard
we
had
invited
you
to
visit
us
and
he
said
he
would
not
come
near
the
grange
as
long
as
you
were
here
oh
you
ca
realize
how
bitter
and
obstinate
he
is
we
pleaded
with
him
but
i
think
that
only
made
him
worse
we
have
felt
so
bad
over
it
your
aunt
ellen
and
your
uncle
george
and
i
but
we
can
do
nothing
at
all
worth
had
listened
gravely
the
story
was
all
new
to
her
but
she
had
long
thought
there
must
be
a
something
at
the
root
of
her
indifferent
relations
with
her
old
home
and
friends
when
aunt
charlotte
flushed
and
finished
speaking
a
little
glimmer
of
fun
came
into
worth
grey
eyes
and
her
dimple
was
very
pronounced
as
she
said
then
if
uncle
paul
will
not
come
to
see
me
i
must
go
to
see
him
my
dear
cried
both
her
aunts
together
in
dismay
aunt
ellen
got
her
breath
first
oh
my
dear
child
you
must
not
think
of
such
a
thing
she
cried
nervously
it
would
never
do
he
would
i
do
know
what
he
would
do
order
you
off
the
premises
or
say
something
dreadful
no
no
wait
perhaps
he
will
come
after
all
we
will
see
you
must
have
patience
worth
shook
her
head
and
the
smile
in
her
eyes
deepened
i
do
think
he
will
come
she
said
mother
has
told
me
something
about
the
ingelow
stubbornness
she
says
i
have
it
in
full
measure
but
i
like
to
call
it
determination
it
sounds
so
much
better
no
the
mountain
will
not
come
to
mohammed
so
mohammed
will
go
to
the
mountain
i
think
i
will
walk
down
to
greenwood
this
afternoon
there
dear
aunties
do
look
so
troubled
uncle
paul
wo
run
at
me
with
a
pitchfork
will
he
he
ca
do
worse
than
order
me
off
his
premises
as
you
say
aunt
charlotte
shook
her
head
she
understood
that
no
argument
would
turn
the
girl
from
her
purpose
if
she
had
the
ingelow
will
so
she
said
nothing
more
in
the
afternoon
worth
set
out
for
greenwood
a
mile
away
oh
what
will
paul
say
exclaimed
the
aunts
with
dismal
forebodings
worth
met
her
uncle
paul
at
the
garden
gate
he
was
standing
there
when
she
came
up
the
slope
of
the
long
lane
a
tall
massive
figure
of
a
man
with
black
eyes
a
long
prematurely
white
beard
and
a
hooked
nose
handsome
and
stubborn
enough
paul
ingelow
looked
it
was
not
without
reason
that
his
neighbours
called
him
the
oddest
ingelow
of
them
all
behind
him
was
a
fine
old
farmhouse
in
beautiful
grounds
worth
felt
almost
as
much
interested
in
greenwood
as
in
the
grange
it
had
been
her
mother
home
for
three
years
and
elizabeth
ingelow
had
loved
it
and
talked
much
to
her
daughter
of
it
paul
ingelow
did
not
move
or
speak
although
he
probably
guessed
who
his
visitor
was
worth
held
out
her
hand
how
do
you
do
uncle
paul
she
said
paul
ignored
the
outstretched
hand
who
are
you
he
asked
gruffly
i
am
worth
sheldon
your
sister
elizabeth
daughter
she
answered
wo
you
shake
hands
with
me
uncle
paul
i
have
no
sister
elizabeth
he
answered
unbendingly
worth
folded
her
hands
on
the
gatepost
and
met
his
frowning
gaze
unshrinkingly
oh
yes
you
have
she
said
calmly
you
ca
do
away
with
natural
ties
by
simply
ignoring
them
uncle
paul
they
go
on
existing
i
never
knew
until
this
morning
that
you
were
at
enmity
with
my
mother
she
never
told
me
but
she
has
talked
a
great
deal
of
you
to
me
she
has
told
me
often
how
much
you
and
she
loved
each
other
and
how
good
you
always
were
to
her
she
sent
her
love
to
you
years
ago
i
had
a
sister
elizabeth
said
paul
ingelow
harshly
i
loved
her
very
tenderly
but
she
married
against
my
will
a
shiftless
scamp
who
worth
lifted
her
hand
slightly
he
was
my
father
uncle
paul
and
he
was
always
kind
to
me
whatever
his
faults
may
have
been
i
can
not
listen
to
a
word
against
him
you
should
have
come
here
then
he
said
but
he
said
it
less
harshly
there
was
even
a
certain
reluctant
approval
of
this
composed
independent
niece
in
his
eyes
did
they
tell
you
at
the
grange
that
i
did
want
to
see
you
yes
they
told
me
this
morning
but
wanted
to
see
you
so
i
came
why
can
not
we
be
friends
uncle
paul
not
because
we
are
uncle
and
niece
but
simply
because
you
are
you
and
i
am
i
let
us
leave
my
father
and
mother
out
of
the
question
and
start
fair
on
our
own
account
for
a
moment
uncle
paul
looked
at
her
she
met
his
gaze
frankly
and
firmly
with
a
merry
smile
lurking
in
her
eyes
then
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
a
hearty
laugh
that
was
good
to
hear
very
well
he
said
it
is
a
bargain
he
put
his
hand
over
the
gate
and
shook
hers
then
he
opened
the
gate
and
invited
her
into
the
house
worth
stayed
to
tea
and
uncle
paul
showed
her
all
over
greenwood
you
are
to
come
here
as
often
as
you
like
he
told
her
when
a
young
lady
and
i
make
a
compact
of
friendship
i
am
going
to
live
up
to
it
but
you
are
not
to
talk
to
me
about
your
mother
remember
we
are
friends
because
i
am
i
and
you
are
you
and
there
is
no
question
of
anybody
else
the
grange
ingelows
were
amazed
to
see
paul
bringing
worth
home
in
his
buggy
that
evening
when
worth
had
gone
into
the
house
charlotte
told
him
that
she
was
glad
to
see
that
he
had
relented
towards
child
i
have
not
he
made
stern
answer
i
do
know
whom
you
mean
by
elizabeth
child
that
young
woman
and
i
have
taken
a
liking
for
each
other
which
we
mean
to
cultivate
on
our
own
account
do
call
her
elizabeth
child
to
me
again
as
the
days
and
weeks
went
by
worth
grew
dearer
and
dearer
to
the
grange
folk
the
aunts
often
wondered
to
themselves
how
they
had
existed
before
worth
came
and
oftener
yet
how
they
could
do
without
her
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
go
home
meanwhile
the
odd
friendship
between
her
and
uncle
paul
deepened
and
grew
they
read
and
drove
and
walked
together
worth
spent
half
her
time
at
greenwood
once
uncle
paul
said
to
her
as
if
speaking
half
to
himself
to
think
that
james
sheldon
could
have
a
daughter
like
you
up
went
worth
head
worth
grey
eyes
flashed
i
thought
we
were
not
to
speak
of
my
parents
she
said
you
ought
not
to
have
been
the
first
to
break
the
compact
uncle
paul
i
accept
the
rebuke
and
beg
your
pardon
he
said
he
liked
her
all
the
better
for
those
little
flashes
of
spirit
across
her
girlish
composure
one
day
in
september
they
were
together
in
the
garden
at
greenwood
worth
looking
lovingly
and
regretfully
down
the
avenue
of
box
said
with
a
sigh
next
month
i
must
go
home
how
sorry
i
shall
be
to
leave
the
grange
and
greenwood
i
have
had
such
a
delightful
summer
and
i
have
learned
to
love
all
the
old
nooks
and
corners
as
well
as
if
i
had
lived
here
all
my
life
stay
here
said
uncle
paul
abruptly
stay
here
with
me
i
want
you
worth
let
greenwood
be
your
home
henceforth
and
adopt
your
crusty
old
bachelor
uncle
for
a
father
oh
uncle
paul
cried
worth
i
do
know
i
do
think
oh
you
surprise
me
i
surprise
myself
perhaps
but
i
mean
it
worth
i
am
a
rich
lonely
old
man
and
i
want
to
keep
this
new
interest
you
have
brought
into
my
life
stay
with
me
i
will
try
to
give
you
a
very
happy
life
my
child
and
all
i
have
shall
be
yours
seeing
her
troubled
face
he
added
there
i
do
ask
you
to
decide
right
here
i
suppose
you
have
other
claims
to
adjust
take
time
to
think
it
over
thank
you
said
worth
she
went
back
to
the
grange
as
one
in
a
dream
and
shut
herself
up
in
the
white
southeast
room
to
think
she
knew
that
she
wanted
to
accept
this
unexpected
offer
of
uncle
paul
worth
loyal
tongue
had
never
betrayed
even
to
the
loving
aunts
any
discontent
in
the
prairie
farm
life
that
had
always
been
hers
but
it
had
been
a
hard
life
for
the
girl
narrow
and
she
longed
to
put
forth
her
hand
and
take
this
other
life
which
opened
so
temptingly
before
her
she
knew
too
that
her
mother
ambitious
for
her
child
would
not
be
likely
to
interpose
any
objections
she
had
only
to
go
to
uncle
paul
and
all
that
she
longed
for
would
be
given
her
together
with
the
faithful
protecting
fatherly
love
and
care
that
in
all
its
strength
and
sweetness
had
never
been
hers
she
must
decide
for
herself
not
even
of
aunt
charlotte
or
aunt
ellen
could
she
ask
advice
she
knew
they
would
entreat
her
to
accept
and
she
needed
no
such
incentive
to
her
own
wishes
far
on
into
the
night
worth
sat
at
the
dormer
window
looking
at
the
stars
over
the
apple
trees
and
fighting
her
battle
between
inclination
and
duty
it
was
a
hard
and
stubbornly
contested
battle
but
with
that
square
chin
and
those
unfaltering
grey
eyes
it
could
end
in
only
one
way
next
day
worth
went
down
to
greenwood
well
what
is
it
to
be
said
uncle
paul
without
preface
as
he
met
her
in
the
garden
i
can
not
come
uncle
paul
said
worth
steadily
i
can
not
give
up
my
mother
i
do
ask
you
to
give
her
up
he
said
gruffly
you
can
write
to
her
and
visit
her
i
do
want
to
come
between
parent
and
child
that
is
the
point
exactly
uncle
paul
i
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
for
not
accepting
your
offer
i
wanted
to
you
know
how
much
i
wanted
to
but
i
can
not
mother
and
i
are
so
much
to
each
other
uncle
paul
more
i
am
sure
than
even
most
mothers
and
daughters
you
have
never
let
me
speak
of
her
but
i
must
tell
you
this
mother
has
often
told
me
that
when
i
came
to
her
things
were
going
very
hard
with
her
and
that
i
was
heaven
own
gift
to
comfort
and
encourage
her
then
in
the
ten
years
that
followed
the
three
other
babies
that
came
to
her
all
died
before
they
were
two
years
old
and
with
each
loss
mother
said
i
grew
dearer
to
her
do
you
see
uncle
paul
i
not
merely
just
one
child
to
her
but
i
those
children
six
years
ago
the
twins
were
born
and
they
are
dear
bright
little
lads
but
they
are
very
small
yet
so
mother
has
really
nobody
but
me
i
know
she
would
consent
to
let
me
stay
here
because
she
would
think
it
best
for
me
but
it
would
be
really
best
for
me
it
could
be
best
for
a
girl
to
do
what
was
right
i
love
you
uncle
paul
and
i
love
greenwood
and
i
want
to
stay
so
much
but
i
can
not
i
have
thought
it
all
over
and
i
must
go
back
to
mother
uncle
paul
did
not
say
one
word
he
turned
his
back
on
worth
and
walked
the
full
length
of
the
box
alley
twice
worth
watched
him
wistfully
was
he
very
angry
would
he
forgive
her
you
are
an
ingelow
worth
he
said
when
he
came
back
that
was
all
but
worth
understood
that
her
decision
was
not
to
cause
any
estrangement
between
them
a
month
later
worth
last
day
at
the
grange
came
she
was
to
leave
for
the
west
the
next
morning
they
were
all
out
in
grandfather
ingelow
arcade
uncle
george
and
aunt
charlotte
and
aunt
ellen
and
worth
enjoying
the
ripe
mellow
sunshine
of
the
october
day
when
paul
ingelow
came
up
the
slope
worth
went
to
meet
him
with
outstretched
hands
he
took
them
both
in
his
and
looked
at
her
very
gravely
i
have
not
come
to
say
goodbye
worth
i
will
not
say
it
you
are
coming
back
to
me
worth
shook
her
brown
head
sadly
oh
i
can
not
uncle
paul
you
know
i
told
you
yes
i
know
he
interrupted
i
have
been
thinking
it
all
over
every
day
since
you
know
yourself
what
the
ingelow
determination
is
it
a
good
thing
in
a
good
cause
but
a
bad
thing
in
a
bad
one
and
it
is
no
easy
thing
to
conquer
when
you
let
it
rule
you
for
years
as
i
have
done
but
i
have
conquered
it
or
you
have
conquered
it
for
me
child
here
is
a
letter
it
is
to
your
mother
my
sister
elizabeth
in
it
i
have
asked
her
to
forgive
me
and
to
forget
our
long
estrangement
i
have
asked
her
to
come
back
to
me
with
you
and
her
boys
i
want
you
all
all
at
greenwood
and
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
for
you
all
oh
uncle
paul
cried
worth
her
face
aglow
and
quivering
with
smiles
and
tears
and
sunshine
do
you
think
she
will
forgive
me
and
come
i
know
she
will
cried
worth
i
know
how
she
has
longed
for
you
and
home
oh
i
am
so
happy
uncle
paul
he
smiled
at
her
and
put
his
arm
over
her
shoulder
together
they
walked
up
the
golden
arcade
to
tell
the
others
that
night
charlotte
and
ellen
cried
with
happiness
as
they
talked
it
over
in
the
twilight
how
beautiful
murmured
charlotte
softly
we
shall
not
lose
worth
after
all
ellen
i
could
not
have
borne
it
to
see
that
girl
go
utterly
out
of
our
lives
again
i
always
hoped
and
believed
that
elizabeth
child
would
somehow
bring
us
all
together
again
said
ellen
happily
freda
adopted
grave
north
point
where
freda
lived
was
the
bleakest
settlement
in
the
world
even
its
inhabitants
who
loved
it
had
to
admit
that
the
northeast
winds
swept
whistling
up
the
bay
and
blew
rawly
over
the
long
hill
that
sloped
down
to
it
blighting
everything
that
was
in
their
way
only
the
sturdy
firs
and
spruces
could
hold
their
own
against
it
so
there
were
no
orchards
or
groves
or
flower
gardens
in
north
point
just
over
the
hill
in
a
sheltered
southwest
valley
was
the
north
point
church
with
the
graveyard
behind
it
and
this
graveyard
was
the
most
beautiful
spot
in
north
point
or
near
it
the
north
point
folk
loved
flowers
they
could
not
have
them
about
their
homes
so
they
had
them
in
their
graveyard
it
was
a
matter
of
pride
with
each
family
to
keep
the
separate
plot
neatly
trimmed
and
weeded
and
adorned
with
beautiful
blossoms
it
was
one
of
the
unwritten
laws
of
the
little
community
that
on
some
selected
day
in
may
everybody
would
repair
to
the
graveyard
to
plant
trim
and
clip
it
was
not
an
unpleasant
duty
even
to
those
whose
sorrow
was
fresh
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
still
doing
something
for
the
friends
who
had
gone
when
they
made
their
earthly
resting
places
beautiful
as
for
the
children
they
looked
forward
to
graveyard
day
as
a
very
delightful
anniversary
and
it
divided
its
spring
honours
with
the
amount
of
the
herring
catch
tomorrow
is
graveyard
day
said
minnie
hutchinson
at
school
recess
when
all
the
little
girls
were
sitting
on
the
fence
ai
i
glad
i
got
the
loveliest
big
white
rosebush
to
plant
by
grandma
hutchinson
grave
uncle
robert
sent
it
out
from
town
my
mother
has
ten
tuberoses
to
set
out
said
nan
gray
proudly
we
going
to
plant
a
row
of
lilies
right
around
our
plot
said
katie
morris
every
little
girl
had
some
boast
to
make
that
is
every
little
girl
but
freda
freda
sat
in
a
corner
all
by
herself
and
felt
miserably
outside
of
everything
she
had
no
part
or
lot
in
graveyard
day
are
you
going
to
plant
anything
freda
asked
nan
with
a
wink
at
the
others
freda
shook
her
head
mutely
freda
ca
plant
anything
said
winnie
bell
cruelly
although
she
did
not
mean
to
be
cruel
she
has
got
a
grave
just
then
freda
felt
as
if
her
gravelessness
were
a
positive
disgrace
and
crime
as
if
not
to
have
an
interest
in
a
single
grave
in
north
point
cemetery
branded
you
as
an
outcast
forever
and
ever
it
very
nearly
did
in
north
point
the
other
little
girls
pitied
freda
but
at
the
same
time
they
rather
looked
down
upon
her
for
it
with
the
complacency
of
those
who
had
been
born
into
a
good
heritage
of
family
graves
and
had
an
undisputed
right
to
celebrate
graveyard
day
freda
felt
that
her
cup
of
wretchedness
was
full
she
sat
miserably
on
the
fence
while
the
other
girls
ran
off
to
play
and
she
walked
home
alone
at
night
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
bear
it
any
longer
freda
was
ten
years
old
four
years
ago
wilson
had
taken
her
from
the
orphan
asylum
in
town
wilson
lived
just
this
side
of
the
hill
from
the
graveyard
and
everybody
in
north
point
called
her
a
crank
they
pitied
any
child
she
took
they
said
it
would
be
worked
to
death
and
treated
like
a
slave
at
first
they
tried
to
pump
freda
concerning
wilson
treatment
of
her
but
freda
was
not
to
be
pumped
she
was
a
quiet
little
mite
with
big
wistful
dark
eyes
that
had
a
disconcerting
fashion
of
looking
the
gossips
out
of
countenance
but
if
freda
had
been
disposed
to
complain
the
north
point
people
would
have
found
out
that
they
had
been
only
too
correct
in
their
predictions
wilson
freda
said
timidly
that
night
why
have
we
got
a
grave
wilson
averred
that
such
a
question
gave
her
the
creeps
you
ought
to
be
very
thankful
that
we
have
she
said
severely
that
graveyard
day
is
a
heathenish
custom
anyhow
they
make
a
regular
picnic
of
it
and
it
makes
me
sick
to
hear
those
school
girls
chattering
about
what
they
mean
to
plant
each
one
trying
to
outblow
the
other
if
i
a
grave
there
i
would
make
a
flower
garden
of
it
freda
did
not
go
to
the
graveyard
the
next
day
although
it
was
a
holiday
but
in
the
evening
when
everybody
had
gone
home
she
crept
over
the
hill
and
through
the
beech
grove
to
see
what
had
been
done
the
plots
were
all
very
neat
and
prettily
set
out
with
plants
and
bulbs
some
perennials
were
already
in
bud
the
grave
of
katie
who
had
been
dead
for
forty
years
was
covered
with
blossoming
purple
pansies
every
grave
no
matter
how
small
or
old
had
its
share
of
promise
every
grave
except
one
freda
came
across
it
with
a
feeling
of
surprise
it
was
away
down
in
the
lower
corner
where
there
were
no
plots
it
was
shut
off
from
the
others
by
a
growth
of
young
poplars
and
was
sunken
and
overgrown
with
blueberry
shrubs
there
was
no
headstone
and
it
looked
dismally
neglected
freda
felt
a
sympathy
for
it
she
had
no
grave
and
this
grave
had
nobody
to
tend
it
or
care
for
it
when
she
went
home
she
asked
wilson
whose
it
was
humph
said
wilson
if
you
have
so
much
spare
time
lying
round
loose
you
better
put
it
into
your
sewing
instead
of
prowling
about
graveyards
do
you
expect
me
to
work
my
fingers
to
the
bone
making
clothes
for
you
i
wish
i
left
you
in
the
asylum
that
grave
is
jordan
slade
i
suppose
he
died
twenty
years
ago
and
a
worthless
drunken
scamp
he
was
he
served
a
term
in
the
penitentiary
for
breaking
into
andrew
messervey
store
and
after
it
he
had
the
face
to
come
back
to
north
point
but
respectable
people
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
he
went
to
the
dogs
altogether
had
to
be
buried
on
charity
when
he
died
he
has
any
relations
here
there
was
a
sister
a
little
girl
of
ten
who
used
to
live
with
the
cogswells
over
at
east
point
after
jord
died
some
rich
folks
saw
her
and
was
so
struck
with
her
good
looks
that
they
took
her
away
with
them
i
know
what
become
of
her
and
i
do
care
go
and
bring
the
cows
up
when
freda
went
to
bed
that
night
her
mind
was
made
up
she
would
adopt
jordan
slade
grave
thereafter
freda
spent
her
few
precious
moments
in
the
graveyard
she
clipped
the
blueberry
shrubs
and
long
tangled
grasses
from
the
grave
with
a
pair
of
rusty
old
shears
that
blistered
her
little
brown
hands
badly
she
brought
ferns
from
the
woods
to
plant
about
it
she
begged
a
root
of
heliotrope
from
nan
gray
a
clump
of
day
lilies
from
katie
morris
a
rosebush
slip
from
nellie
bell
some
pansy
seed
from
old
bennett
and
a
geranium
shoot
from
minnie
hutchinson
big
sister
she
planted
weeded
and
watered
faithfully
and
her
efforts
were
rewarded
her
grave
soon
looked
as
nice
as
any
in
the
graveyard
nobody
but
freda
knew
about
it
the
poplar
growth
concealed
the
corner
from
sight
and
everybody
had
quite
forgotten
poor
disreputable
jordan
slade
grave
at
least
it
seemed
as
if
everybody
had
but
one
evening
when
freda
slipped
down
to
the
graveyard
with
a
little
can
of
water
and
rounded
the
corner
of
the
poplars
she
saw
a
lady
standing
by
the
grave
a
strange
lady
dressed
in
black
with
the
loveliest
face
freda
had
ever
seen
and
tears
in
her
eyes
the
lady
gave
a
little
start
when
she
saw
freda
with
her
can
of
water
can
you
tell
me
who
has
been
looking
after
this
grave
she
said
it
it
was
i
faltered
freda
wondering
if
the
lady
would
be
angry
with
her
pleas
it
was
i
but
i
did
mean
any
harm
all
the
other
little
girls
had
a
grave
and
i
had
any
so
i
just
adopted
this
one
did
you
know
whose
it
was
asked
the
lady
gently
yes
jordan
slade
wilson
told
me
jordan
slade
was
my
brother
said
the
lady
he
went
sadly
astray
but
he
was
not
all
bad
he
was
weak
and
too
easily
influenced
but
whatever
his
faults
he
was
good
and
kind
oh
so
good
and
kind
to
me
when
i
was
a
child
i
loved
him
with
all
my
heart
it
has
always
been
my
wish
to
come
back
and
visit
his
grave
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
come
my
home
has
been
so
far
away
i
expected
to
find
it
neglected
i
can
not
tell
you
how
pleased
and
touched
i
am
to
find
it
kept
so
beautifully
thank
you
over
and
over
again
my
dear
child
then

not
cross
said
freda
eagerly
and
i
may
go
on
looking
after
it

i
oh
it
just
seems
as
if
i
could
bear
not
to

want
to
my
dear

grave

and

that
summer
was
a
wonderful
one
for
freda
she
had
found
a
firm
friend
in
halliday
the
latter
was
a
wealthy
woman
her
husband
had
died
a
short
time
previously
and
she
had
no
children
when
she
went
away
in
the
fall
freda
went
with
her
to
be
her
own
little
girl
for
always
wilson
consented
grudgingly
to
give
freda
up
although
she
grumbled
a
great
deal
about
ingratitude
before
they
went
they
paid
a
farewell
visit
to
their
grave
halliday
had
arranged
with
some
of
the
north
point
people
to
keep
it
well
attended
to
but
freda
cried
at
leaving
it
do
feel
badly
about
it
dear
comforted
halliday
we
are
coming
back
every
summer
to
see
it
it
will
always

our
grave
freda
slipped
her
hand
into
halliday
and
smiled
up
at
her
i
never
have
found
you
aunty
if
it
had
been
for
this
grave
she
said
happily
i
so
glad
i
adopted
it
how
don
was
saved
will
barrie
went
whistling
down
the
lane
of
the
locksley
farm
took
a
short
cut
over
a
field
of
clover
aftermath
and
through
a
sloping
orchard
where
the
trees
were
laden
with
apples
and
emerged
into
the
farmhouse
yard
where
curtis
locksley
was
sitting
on
a
pile
of
logs
idly
whittling
at
a
stick
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
corner
in
time
curt
said
will
i
call
that
luck
for
i
want
you
to
go
chestnutting
up
to
grier
hill
with
me
i
met
old
tom
grier
on
the
road
yesterday
and
he
told
me
i
might
go
any
day
nice
old
man
tom
grier
good
said
curtis
heartily
as
he
sprang
up
if
i
have
exactly
a
corner
in
time
i
have
a
day
off
at
least
uncle
does
need
me
today
wait
till
i
whistle
for
don
may
as
well
take
him
with
us
curtis
whistled
accordingly
but
don
his
handsome
newfoundland
dog
did
not
appear
after
calling
and
whistling
about
the
yard
and
barns
for
several
minutes
curtis
turned
away
disappointedly
he
ca
be
anywhere
around
it
is
very
strange
don
never
used
to
go
away
from
home
without
me
but
lately
he
has
been
missing
several
times
and
twice
last
week
he
was
here
in
the
morning
and
turn
up
until
midday
i
keep
him
shut
up
until
i
broke
him
of
the
habit
of
playing
truant
if
i
were
you
said
will
as
they
turned
into
the
lane
don
hates
to
be
shut
up
howls
all
the
time
so
mournfully
that
i
ca
stand
it
responded
curtis
well
said
will
hesitatingly
maybe
that
would
be
better
after
all
than
letting
him
stray
away
with
other
dogs
who
may
teach
him
bad
habits
i
saw
don
myself
one
evening
last
week
ambling
down
the
harbour
road
with
that
big
brown
dog
of
sam
ventnor
ventnor
dog
is
beginning
to
have
a
bad
reputation
you
know
there
have
been
several
sheep
worried
lately
and
don
would
touch
a
sheep
interrupted
curtis
hotly
i
daresay
not
not
yet
but
ventnor
dog
is
under
suspicion
and
if
don
runs
with
him
he
learn
the
trick
sure
as
preaching
the
farmers
are
growling
a
good
bit
already
and
if
they
hear
of
don
and
dog
going
about
in
company
they
put
it
on
them
both
better
keep
don
shut
up
awhile
let
him
howl
as
he
likes
i
believe
i
will
said
curtis
soberly
i
do
want
don
to
fall
under
suspicion
of
though
i
sure
he
would
never
do
it
anyhow
i
do
want
him
to
run
with
ventnor
dog
i
chain
him
up
in
the
barn
when
i
go
home
i
could
stand
it
if
anything
happened
to
don
after
you
he
the
only
chum
i
got
and
he
a
good
one
will
agreed
he
was
almost
as
fond
of
don
as
curtis
was
but
he
did
not
feel
so
sure
that
the
dog
would
not
worry
a
sheep
will
knew
that
don
was
suspected
already
but
he
did
not
like
to
tell
curtis
so
and
of
course
there
was
as
yet
no
positive
proof
merely
mutterings
and
suggestions
among
the
bayside
farmers
who
had
lost
sheep
and
were
anxious
to
locate
their
slayer
there
were
many
other
dogs
in
bayside
and
the
surrounding
districts
who
were
just
as
likely
to
be
the
guilty
animals
and
will
hoped
that
if
don
were
shut
up
for
a
time
suspicion
might
be
averted
from
him
especially
if
the
worryings
still
went
on
he
had
felt
a
little
doubtful
about
hinting
the
truth
to
curtis
who
was
a
lad
and
always
resented
any
slur
cast
upon
don
much
more
bitterly
than
if
it
were
meant
for
himself
but
he
knew
that
curtis
would
take
it
better
from
him
than
from
the
other
bayside
boys
one
or
the
other
of
whom
would
be
sure
soon
to
cast
something
up
to
curtis
about
his
dog
will
felt
decidedly
relieved
to
find
that
curtis
took
his
advice
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
offered
who
have
lost
sheep
lately
queried
curtis
as
they
left
the
main
road
and
struck
into
a
wood
path
through
the
ranks
of
beeches
on
tom
grier
land
nearly
everybody
on
the
hollow
farms
answered
will
until
last
week
nobody
on
the
hill
farms
had
lost
any
but
tuesday
night
old
paul
stockton
had
six
fine
sheep
killed
in
his
upland
pasture
behind
the
fir
woods
he
is
furious
about
it
i
believe
and
vows
he
find
out
what
dog
did
it
and
have
him
shot
curtis
looked
grave
paul
stockton
farm
was
only
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
locksley
homestead
and
he
knew
that
paul
had
an
old
family
grudge
against
his
uncle
arnold
which
included
his
nephew
and
all
belonging
to
him
moreover
curtis
remembered
with
a
sinking
heart
that
wednesday
morning
had
been
one
of
the
mornings
upon
which
don
was
missing
but
i
do
care
he
thought
miserably
i
know
don
did
kill
those
sheep
talking
of
old
paul
said
will
who
thought
it
advisable
to
turn
the
conversation
reminds
me
that
they
are
getting
anxious
at
the
harbour
about
george
finley
schooner
the
she
was
due
three
days
ago
and
there
no
sign
of
her
yet
and
there
have
been
two
bad
gales
since
she
left
morro
oscar
stockton
is
on
board
of
her
you
know
and
his
father
is
worried
about
him
there
are
five
other
men
on
her
all
from
the
harbour
and
their
folks
down
there
are
pretty
wild
about
the
schooner
nothing
more
was
said
about
the
sheep
and
soon
in
the
pleasures
of
chestnutting
curtis
forgot
his
anxiety
old
tom
grier
had
called
to
the
boys
as
they
passed
his
house
to
come
back
and
have
dinner
there
when
the
time
came
this
they
did
and
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
curtis
with
his
bag
of
chestnuts
over
his
shoulder
walked
into
the
locksley
yard
his
uncle
was
standing
before
the
open
barn
doors
talking
to
an
elderly
grizzled
man
with
a
thin
shrewd
face
curtis
heart
sank
as
he
recognized
old
paul
stockton
what
could
have
brought
him
over
curtis
called
his
uncle
come
here
as
curtis
crossed
the
yard
don
came
bounding
down
the
slope
from
the
house
to
meet
him
he
put
his
hand
on
the
dog
big
head
and
the
two
of
them
walked
slowly
to
the
barn
old
paul
included
them
both
in
a
vindictive
scowl
curtis
said
his
uncle
gravely
here
a
bad
business
stockton
tells
me
that
your
dog
has
been
worrying
his
sheep
it
a
began
curtis
angrily
then
he
checked
himself
and
went
on
more
calmly
that
ca
be
so
stockton
my
dog
would
not
harm
anything
he
killed
or
helped
to
kill
six
of
the
finest
sheep
in
my
flock
retorted
old
paul
what
proof
have
you
of
it
demanded
curtis
trying
to
keep
his
anger
within
bounds
abner
peck
saw
your
dog
and
ventnor
running
together
through
my
sheep
pasture
at
sundown
on
tuesday
evening
answered
old
paul
wednesday
morning
i
found
this
in
the
corner
of
the
pasture
where
the
sheep
were
worried
your
uncle
admits
that
it
was
tied
around
your
dog
neck
on
tuesday
and
old
paul
held
out
triumphantly
a
faded
red
ribbon
curtis
recognized
it
at
a
glance
it
was
the
ribbon
his
little
cousin
lena
had
tied
around
don
neck
tuesday
afternoon
he
remembered
how
they
had
laughed
at
the
effect
of
that
frivolous
red
collar
and
bow
on
don
massive
body
i
sure
don
is
guilty
he
cried
passionately
locksley
shook
his
head
i
afraid
he
is
curtis
the
case
looks
very
black
against
him
and
is
a
serious
offence
the
dog
must
be
shot
said
old
paul
decidedly
i
leave
the
matter
in
your
hands
locksley
i
got
enough
proof
to
convict
the
dog
and
if
you
do
have
him
killed
i
make
you
pay
for
the
sheep
he
worried
as
old
paul
strode
away
curtis
looked
beseechingly
at
his
uncle
don
must
be
shot
uncle
he
said
desperately
i
chain
him
up
all
the
time
and
have
him
howling
night
and
day
as
if
we
had
a
brood
of
banshees
about
the
place
said
locksley
sarcastically
he
was
a
stern
man
with
little
sentiment
in
his
nature
and
no
understanding
whatever
of
curtis
affection
for
don
the
bayside
people
said
that
arnold
locksley
had
always
been
very
severe
with
his
nephew
no
no
curtis
you
must
look
at
the
matter
sensibly
the
dog
is
a
nuisance
and
must
be
shot
you
ca
keep
him
shut
up
forever
and
if
he
has
once
learned
the
trick
of
he
will
never
forget
it
you
can
get
another
dog
if
you
must
have
one
i
get
charles
pippey
to
come
and
shoot
don
tomorrow
no
sulking
now
curtis
you
are
too
big
a
boy
for
that
tie
the
dog
up
for
the
night
and
then
go
and
put
the
calves
in
there
is
a
storm
coming
the
wind
is
blowing
hard
from
the
northeast
now
his
uncle
walked
away
leaving
the
boy
white
and
miserable
in
the
yard
he
looked
at
don
who
sat
on
his
haunches
and
returned
his
gaze
frankly
and
he
did
not
look
like
a
guilty
dog
could
it
be
possible
that
he
had
really
worried
those
sheep
i
never
believe
it
of
you
old
fellow
curtis
said
as
he
led
the
dog
into
a
corner
of
the
carriage
house
and
tied
him
up
there
then
he
flung
himself
down
on
a
pile
of
sacks
beside
him
and
buried
his
face
in
don
curly
black
fur
the
boy
felt
sullen
rebellious
and
wretched
he
lay
there
until
dark
thinking
his
own
bitter
thoughts
and
listening
to
the
rapidly
increasing
gale
finally
he
got
up
and
flung
off
after
the
calves
with
don
melancholy
howls
at
finding
himself
deserted
ringing
in
his
ears
he
be
quiet
enough
tomorrow
night
thought
curtis
wretchedly
as
he
went
upstairs
to
bed
after
housing
the
calves
for
a
long
while
he
lay
awake
but
finally
dropped
into
a
heavy
slumber
which
lasted
until
his
aunt
called
him
for
milking
the
wind
was
blowing
more
furiously
than
ever
up
over
the
fields
came
the
roar
and
crash
of
the
surges
on
the
outside
shore
the
harbour
to
the
east
of
bayside
was
rough
and
stormy
they
were
just
rising
from
breakfast
when
will

into
the
kitchen
the
is

on

he
shouted
struck
there
at
daylight
this
morning
come
on
curt
curtis
sprang
for
his
cap
his
uncle
following
suit
more
deliberately
as
the
two
boys
ran
through
the
yard
curtis
heard
don
howling
i
take
him
with
me
he
muttered
wait
a
minute
will
the
harbour
road
was
thronged
with
people
hurrying
to
the
outside
shore
for
the
news
of
the
disaster
had
spread
rapidly
as
the
boys
with
the
rejoicing

at
their
heels
pelted
along

them
in
a
cart
and
told

at
them
over
the
shriek
of
the
gale

which
was
black
with
excited
people
out
on
gleeson

the
little
schooner
was
visible
amid
the
flying
spray

grizzled
old
harbour

to
stan
by
an
watch
yer
neighbours
drown
like
this
curtis
and
will
elbowed
their
way
down
to
the
water
edge
the
relatives
of
the
crew
were
all
there
in
various
stages
of
despair
but
old
paul
stockton
seemed
like
a
man
demented
he
ran
up
and
down
the
beach
crying
and
praying
his
only
son
was
on
the
and
he
could
do
nothing
to
save
him
what
are
they
doing
asked
will
of
martin
clark
trying
to
get
a
line
ashore
by
throwing
out
a
small
rope
with
a
stick
tied
to
it
answered
martin
it
young
stockton
that
trying
now
but
it
is
any
use
the
on
that
reef
are
too
powerful
why
don
will
bring
that
line
ashore
exclaimed
curtis
here
don
don
i
say
the
dog
bounded
back
along
the
shore
with
a
quick
bark
curtis
grasped
him
by
the
collar
and
pointed
to
the
stick
which
young
stockton
had
just
hurled
again
into
the
water
don
with
another
bark
of
comprehension
dashed
into
the
sea
the
onlookers
grasping
the
situation
gave
a
cheer
and
then
relapsed
into
silence
only
the
shriek
of
the
gale
and
the
crash
of
the
waves
could
be
heard
as
they
watched
the
magnificent
dog
swimming
out
through
the
breakers
his
big
black
head
now
rising
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
and
now
disappearing
in
the
hollow
behind
it
when
don
finally
reached
the
tossing
stick
grasped
it
in
his
mouth
and
turned
shoreward
another
great
shout
went
up
from
the
beach
a
woman
behind
curtis
whose
husband
was
on
the
schooner
dropped
on
her
knees
on
the
pebbles
sobbing
and
thanking
god
curtis
himself
felt
the
stinging
tears
start
to
his
eyes
when
don
reached
the
shore
he
dropped
the
stick
at
curtis
feet
and
gave
himself
a
tremendous
shake
curtis
caught
at
the
stick
while
a
dozen
men
and
women
threw
themselves
bodily
on
don
hugging
him
and
kissing
his
wet
fur
like
distracted
creatures
old
paul
stockton
was
among
them
over
his
shoulder
don
big
black
head
looked
up
his
eyes
asking
as
plainly
as
speech
what
all
this
fuss
was
about
meanwhile
some
of
the
men
had
already
pulled
a
big
hawser
ashore
and
made
it
fast
in
half
an
hour
the
crew
of
the
were
safe
on
shore
chilled
and
dripping
before
they
were
hurried
away
to
warmth
and
shelter
old
paul
stockton
caught
curtis
hand
the
tears
were
running
freely
down
his
hard
old
face
tell
your
uncle
he
is
not
to
lay
a
finger
on
that
dog
he
said
he
never
killed
a
sheep
of
mine
he
could
and
if
he
did
i
do
care
he
welcome
to
kill
them
all
if
nothing
but
mutton
serve
his
turn
curtis
walked
home
with
a
glad
heart
locksley
heard
old
message
with
a
smile
he
too
had
been
touched
by
don
splendid
feat
well
curtis
i
very
glad
that
it
has
turned
old
paul
in
his
favour
but
we
must
shut
don
up
for
a
week
or
so
no
matter
how
hard
he
takes
it
you
can
see
that
for
yourself
after
all
he
might
have
worried
the
sheep
and
anyway
he
must
be
broken
of
his
intimacy
with
ventnor
dog
curtis
acknowledged
the
justice
of
this
and
poor
don
was
tied
up
again
his
captivity
was
not
long
however
for
ventnor
dog
was
soon
shot
when
don
was
released
curtis
had
an
anxious
time
for
a
week
or
two
but
no
more
sheep
were
worried
and
don
innocence
was
triumphantly
established
as
for
old
paul
stockton
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
do
enough
for
curtis
and
don
his
ancient
grudge
against
the
locksleys
was
completely
forgotten
and
from
that
date
he
was
a
firm
friend
of
curtis
in
regard
to
don
old
paul
would
say
why
there
never
was
such
a
dog
before
sir
never
he
just
talks
with
his
eyes
that
dog
does
and
if
you
just
seen
him
swimming
out
to
that
schooner
bones
yes
sir
every
time
that
dog
comes
here
he
to
get
the
best
bones
we
got
for
him
and
bones
too
that
dog
a
hero
sir
that
what
he
is
miss
madeline
proposal
auntie
i
have
something
to
tell
you
said
lina
with
a
blush
that
made
her
look
more
than
ever
like
one
of
the
climbing
roses
that
nodded
about
the
windows
of
the
old
churchill
place
as
it
was
always
called
in
lower
wentworth
miss
madeline
sitting
in
the
low
rocker
by
the
parlour
window
seemed
like
the
presiding
genius
of
the
place
everything
about
her
matched
her
sweet
from
the
crown
of
her
soft
brown
hair
dressed
in
the
style
of
her
long
ago
girlhood
to
the
toes
of
her
daintily
slippered
feet
outside
of
the
old
churchill
place
in
the
busy
streets
of
the
little
town
miss
madeline
might
have
seemed
out
of
harmony
with
her
surroundings
but
here
in
this
dim
room
faintly
scented
with
whiffs
from
the
rose
garden
outside
she
was
like
a
note
in
some
sweet
perfect
melody
of
old
time
lina
sitting
on
a
little
stool
at
miss
madeline
feet
with
her
curly
head
in
her
aunt
lap
was
as
pretty
as
miss
madeline
herself
had
once
been
she
was
also
very
happy
and
her
happiness
seemed
to
envelop
her
as
in
an
atmosphere
and
lend
her
a
new
radiance
and
charm
miss
madeline
loved
her
pretty
niece
very
dearly
and
patted
the
curly
head
tenderly
with
her
slender
white
hands
what
is
it
my
dear
i
i
engaged
whispered
lina
hiding
her
face
in
miss
flowered
muslin
lap
engaged
miss
madeline
tone
was
one
of
surprise
and
awe
she
blushed
as
she
said
the
word
as
deeply
as
lina
had
done
then
she
went
on
with
a
little
quiver
of
excitement
in
her
voice
to
whom
my
dear
oh
you
do
know
him
auntie
but
i
hope
you
will
soon
his
name
is
ralph
wylde
is
it
pretty
i
met
him
last
winter
and
we
became
very
good
friends
but
we
had
a
quarrel
before
i
came
down
here
and
oh
i
have
been
so
unhappy
over
it
three
weeks
ago
he
wrote
me
and
begged
my
pardon
so
nice
of
him
because
i
was
really
all
to
blame
you
know
and
he
said
he
loved
me
and
all
that
you
know
no
i
do
know
said
miss
madeline
gently
but
but
i
can
imagine
oh
i
was
so
happy
i
wrote
back
and
i
had
this
letter
from
him
today
he
is
coming
down
tomorrow
you
be
glad
to
see
him
you
auntie
oh
yes
my
dear
and
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
very
glad
you
are
sure
you
love
him
yes
indeed
said
lina
with
a
little
laugh
as
if
wondering
how
anyone
could
doubt
it
presently
miss
madeline
said
in
a
shy
voice
lina
did
did
you
ever
receive
a
proposal
of
marriage
from
anybody
besides
mr
wylde
lina
laughed
roguishly
why
yes
auntie
ever
so
many
a
dozen
at
least
oh
my
dear
cried
miss
madeline
in
a
slightly
shocked
tone
but
i
did
really
sometimes
it
was
horrid
and
sometimes
it
was
funny
it
all
depended
on
the
man
dear
me
how
red
and
uncomfortable
most
of
them
looked
all
but
the
fifth
he
was
so
cool
and
business
like
that
he
almost
surprised
me
into
accepting
him
and
and
what
did
you
feel
like
lina
oh
frightened
mostly
but
i
always
wanted
to
laugh
too
you
must
know
how
it
is
yourself
auntie
what
did
you
feel
like
when
somebody
proposed
to
you
miss
madeline
flushed
from
chin
to
brow
oh
lina
she
faltered
as
if
she
were
confessing
something
very
disgraceful
yet
to
which
she
was
impelled
by
her
strict
truthfulness
i
i
never
had
a
proposal
in
my
life
not
one
lina
opened
her
big
brown
eyes
in
amazement
why
aunt
madeline
and
you
so
pretty
what
was
the
reason
i
often
wondered
said
miss
madeline
faintly
i
pretty
as
you
say
it
so
long
ago
i
can
say
that
now
and
i
had
many
gentlemen
friends
but
nobody
ever
wanted
to
marry
me
i
sometimes
wish
that
that
i
could
have
had
just
one
proposal
not
that
i
wanted
to
marry
you
know
i
do
not
mean
that
but
just
so
that
it
would
have
seemed
that
i
was
different
from
anybody
else
it
is
very
foolish
of
me
to
wish
it
i
know
and
even
wicked
for
if
i
had
not
cared
for
the
person
it
would
have
made
him
very
unhappy
but
then
he
would
have
forgotten
and
i
would
have
remembered
it
would
always
have
been
something
to
be
a
little
proud
of
yes
said
lina
absently
her
thoughts
had
gone
back
to
ralph
that
evening
a
letter
was
left
at
the
front
door
of
the
old
churchill
place
it
was
addressed
in
a
scholarly
hand
to
miss
madeline
churchill
and
amelia
kent
took
it
in
amelia
had
been
miss
help
for
years
and
had
grown
grey
in
her
service
in
amelia
loyal
eyes
miss
madeline
was
still
young
and
beautiful
she
never
doubted
that
the
letter
was
for
her
mistress
nobody
else
there
was
ever
addressed
as
miss
madeline
miss
madeline
was
sitting
by
the
window
of
her
own
room
watching
the
sunset
through
the
elms
and
reading
her
evening
portion
of
thomas
à
kempis
she
never
liked
to
be
disturbed
when
so
employed
but
she
read
her
letter
after
amelia
had
gone
out
when
she
came
to
a
certain
paragraph
she
turned
very
pale
and
thomas
à
kempis
fell
to
the
floor
unheeded
when
she
had
finished
the
letter
she
laid
it
on
her
lap
clasped
her
hands
and
said
oh
oh
oh
in
a
faint
tremulous
voice
her
cheeks
were
very
pink
and
her
eyes
very
bright
she
did
not
even
pick
up
thomas
à
kempis
but
went
to
the
door
and
called
lina
what
is
it
auntie
asked
lina
curiously
noticing
the
signs
of
unusual
excitement
about
miss
madeline
miss
madeline
held
out
her
letter
with
a
trembling
hand
lina
dear
this
is
a
letter
from
the
rev
cecil
thorne
it
it
is
a
proposal
of
marriage
i
feel
terribly
upset
how
very
strange
that
it
should
come
so
soon
after
our
talk
this
morning
i
want
you
to
read
it
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
show
it
to
anyone
but
i
would
like
you
to
see
it
lina
took
the
letter
and
read
it
through
it
was
unmistakably
a
proposal
of
marriage
and
was
moreover
a
very
charming
epistle
of
its
kind
albeit
a
little
stiff
and
how
funny
said
lina
when
she
came
to
the
end
funny
exclaimed
miss
madeline
with
a
trace
of
indignation
in
her
gentle
voice
oh
i
did
mean
that
the
letter
was
funny
lina
hastened
to
explain
only
that
as
you
said
it
is
odd
to
think
of
it
coming
so
soon
after
our
talk
but
this
was
a
little
fib
on
lina
part
she
thought
that
the
letter
or
rather
the
fact
that
it
had
been
written
to
miss
madeline
funny
the
rev
cecil
thorne
was
miss
madeline
pastor
he
was
a
handsome
scholarly
man
of
middle
age
and
lina
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
him
during
her
summer
in
lower
wentworth
she
had
taught
the
infant
class
in
sunday
school
and
sometimes
she
had
thought
that
the
minister
was
in
love
with
her
but
she
must
have
been
mistaken
she
reflected
it
must
have
been
her
aunt
after
all
and
the
rev
cecil
shyly
displayed
interest
in
her
must
have
been
purely
professional
what
a
goose
i
was
to
be
afraid
he
was
in
love
with
me
she
thought
aloud
she
said
he
says
he
will
call
tomorrow
evening
to
receive
your
answer
and
oh
what
can
i
say
to
him
murmured
miss
madeline
in
dismay
she
wished
she
had
a
little
of
lina
experience
you
are
going
to
you
will
accept
him
wo
you
asked
lina
curiously
oh
my
dear
no
cried
miss
madeline
almost
vehemently
i
think
of
such
a
thing
i
am
very
sorry
do
you
think
he
will
feel
badly
judging
from
his
letter
i
feel
sure
he
will
said
lina
decidedly
miss
madeline
sighed
oh
dear
me
it
is
very
unpleasant
but
of
course
i
must
refuse
him
what
a
beautiful
letter
he
writes
too
i
feel
very
much
disturbed
by
this
miss
madeline
picked
up
thomas
à
kempis
smoothed
him
out
repentantly
and
placed
the
letter
between
his
leaves
when
the
rev
cecil
thorne
called
at
the
old
churchill
place
next
evening
at
sunset
and
asked
for
miss
madeline
churchill
amelia
showed
him
into
the
parlour
and
went
to
call
her
mistress
thorne
sat
down
by
the
window
that
looked
out
on
the
lawn
his
heart
gave
a
bound
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
airy
white
muslin
among
the
trees
and
a
ripple
of
distant
laughter
the
next
minute
lina
appeared
strolling
down
the
secluded
path
that
curved
about
the
birches
a
young
man
was
walking
beside
her
with
his
arm
around
her
they
crossed
the
green
square
before
the
house
and
disappeared
in
the
rose
garden
thorne
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
he
felt
that
he
had
received
his
answer
and
it
was
a
very
bitter
moment
for
him
he
had
hardly
dared
hope
that
this
bright
beautiful
child
could
care
for
him
yet
the
realization
came
home
to
him
none
the
less
keenly
when
miss
madeline
paling
and
flushing
by
turns
came
shyly
in
he
had
recovered
his
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
say
good
evening
in
a
calm
voice
miss
madeline
sat
down
opposite
to
him
at
that
moment
she
was
devoutly
thankful
that
she
had
never
had
any
other
proposal
to
refuse
it
was
a
dreadful
ordeal
if
he
would
only
help
her
out
but
he
did
not
speak
and
every
moment
of
silence
made
it
worse
i
received
your
letter
thorne
she
faltered
at
last
looking
distressfully
down
at
the
floor
my
letter
thorne
turned
towards
her
in
her
agitation
miss
madeline
did
not
notice
the
surprise
in
his
face
and
tone
yes
she
said
gaining
a
little
courage
since
the
ice
was
broken
it
it
was
a
very
great
surprise
to
me
i
never
thought
you
you
cared
for
me
as
as
you
said
and
i
am
very
sorry
because
because
i
can
not
return
your
affection
and
so
of
course
i
can
not
marry
you
thorne
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
again
he
understood
now
that
there
had
been
some
mistake
and
that
miss
madeline
had
received
the
letter
he
had
written
to
her
niece
well
it
did
not
matter
the
appearance
of
the
young
man
in
the
garden
had
settled
that
would
he
tell
miss
madeline
of
her
mistake
no
it
would
only
humiliate
her
and
it
made
no
difference
since
she
had
refused
him
i
suppose
it
is
of
no
use
to
ask
you
to
reconsider
your
decision
he
said
oh
no
cried
miss
madeline
almost
aghast
she
was
afraid
he
might
ask
it
after
all
not
in
the
least
use
i
am
sorry
so
very
sorry
but
i
could
not
answer
differently
we
i
hope
this
will
make
no
difference
in
our
friendly
relations
mr
thorne
not
at
all
said
thorne
gravely
we
will
try
to
forget
that
it
has
happened
he
bowed
sadly
and
went
out
miss
madeline
watched
him
guiltily
as
he
walked
across
the
lawn
he
looked
how
dreadful
it
had
been
and
lina
had
refused
twelve
men
how
could
she
have
lived
through
it
perhaps
one
gets
accustomed
to
doing
it
reflected
miss
madeline
but
i
am
sure
i
never
could
did
thorne
feel
very
badly
whispered
lina
that
night
i
afraid
he
did
confessed
miss
madeline
sorrowfully
he
looked
so
pale
and
sad
lina
that
my
heart
ached
for
him
i
am
very
thankful
that
i
have
never
had
any
other
proposals
to
decline
it
is
a
very
unpleasant
experience
but
she
added
with
a
little
tinge
of
satisfaction
in
her
sweet
voice
i
am
glad
i
had
one
it
it
has
made
me
feel
more
like
other
people
you
know
dear
miss
sally
company
how
beautiful
said
mary
seymour
delightedly
as
they
dismounted
from
their
wheels
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
ida
who
could
have
supposed
that
such
a
view
would
be
our
reward
for
climbing
that
long
tedious
hill
with
its
ruts
and
stones
do
you
feel
repaid
yes
but
i
am
dreadfully
thirsty
said
ida
who
was
always
practical
and
never
as
enthusiastic
over
anything
as
mary
was
yet
she
too
felt
a
keen
pleasure
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
them
almost
at
their
feet
lay
the
sea
creaming
and
shimmering
in
the
mellow
sunshine
beyond
on
either
hand
stretched
rugged
brown
cliffs
and
rocks
here
running
out
to
sea
in
misty
purple
headlands
there
curving
into
bays
and
coves
that
seemed
filled
up
with
sunlight
and
glamour
and
pearly
hazes
a
beautiful
shore
and
seemingly
a
lonely
one
the
only
house
visible
from
where
the
girls
stood
was
a
tiny
grey
one
with
odd
low
eaves
and
big
chimneys
that
stood
down
in
the
little
valley
on
their
right
where
the
cliffs
broke
away
to
let
a
brook
run
out
to
sea
and
formed
a
small
cove
on
whose
sandy
shore
the
waves
lapped
and
crooned
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
house
on
either
side
of
the
cove
a
headland
made
out
to
sea
curving
around
to
enclose
the
sparkling
water
as
in
a
cup
what
a
picturesque
spot
said
mary
but
what
a
lonely
one
protested
ida
why
there
is
another
house
in
sight
i
wonder
who
lives
in
it
anyway
i
going
down
to
ask
them
for
a
drink
of
water
i
like
to
ask
for
a
square
meal
too
said
mary
laughing
i
am
discovering
that
i
am
hungry
fine
scenery
is
very
satisfying
to
the
soul
to
be
sure
but
it
does
still
the
cravings
of
the
inner
girl
and
we
wheeled
ten
miles
this
afternoon
i
getting
hungrier
every
minute
they
reached
the
little
grey
house
by
way
of
a
sloping
grassy
lane
everything
about
it
was
very
neat
and
trim
in
front
a
paling
shut
in
the
garden
which
sheltered
as
it
was
by
the
house
was
ablaze
with
poppies
and
hollyhocks
and
geraniums
a
path
bordered
by
big
white
clam
shells
led
through
it
to
the
front
door
whose
steps
were
slabs
of
smooth
red
sandstone
from
the
beach
no
children
here
certainly
whispered
ida
every
one
of
those
clam
shells
is
placed
just
so
and
this
walk
is
swept
every
day
no
we
shall
never
dare
to
ask
for
anything
to
eat
here
they
would
be
afraid
of
our
scattering
crumbs
ida
lifted
her
hand
to
knock
but
before
she
could
do
so
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
breathless
little
lady
appeared
on
the
threshold
she
was
very
small
with
an
eager
delicately
featured
face
and
dark
eyes
twinkling
behind
glasses
she
was
dressed
immaculately
in
an
gown
of
grey
silk
with
a
white
muslin
fichu
crossed
over
her
shoulders
and
her
silvery
hair
fell
on
each
side
of
her
face
in
long
smooth
curls
that
just
touched
her
shoulders
and
bobbed
and
fluttered
with
her
every
motion
behind
it
was
caught
up
in
a
knot
on
her
head
and
surmounted
by
a
tiny
lace
cap
she
looks
as
if
she
had
just
stepped
out
of
a
bandbox
of
last
century
thought
mary
are
you
cousin
abner
girls
demanded
the
little
lady
eagerly
there
was
such
excitement
and
expectation
in
her
face
and
voice
that
both
the
seymour
girls
felt
uncomfortably
that
they
ought
to
be
cousin
abner
girls
no
said
mary
reluctantly
we
not
we
are
only
martin
girls
all
the
light
went
out
of
the
little
lady
face
as
if
some
illuminating
lamp
had
suddenly
been
quenched
behind
it
she
seemed
fairly
to
droop
under
her
disappointment
as
for
the
rest
the
name
of
martin
seymour
evidently
conveyed
no
especial
meaning
to
her
ears
how
could
she
know
that
he
was
a
who
was
popularly
supposed
to
breakfast
on
railroads
and
lunch
on
small
corporations
and
that
his
daughters
were
girls
whom
all
people
delighted
to
honour
no
of
course
you
are
not
cousin
abner
girls
she
said
sorrowfully
i
have
known
you
could
be
if
i
had
just
stopped
to
think
because
you
are
dark
and
they
would
be
fair
of
course
cousin
abner
and
his
wife
were
both
fair
but
when
i
saw
you
coming
down
the
lane
i
was
peeking
through
the
hall
window
upstairs
you
know
i
and
juliana
i
was
sure
you
were
helen
and
beatrice
at
last
and
i
help
wishing
you
were
i
wish
we
were
too
since
you
expected
them
said
mary
smiling
but
oh
i
was
really
expecting
them
broke
in
the
little
lady
only
i
am
always
hoping
that
they
will
come
they
never
have
yet
but
trenton
is
so
very
far
away
and
it
is
so
lonely
here
i
just
long
for
company
i
and
juliana
and
i
thought
i
was
going
to
have
it
today
cousin
abner
came
to
see
me
once
since
i
moved
here
and
he
said
the
girls
would
come
too
but
that
was
six
months
ago
and
they
have
come
yet
but
perhaps
they
will
soon
it
is
always
something
to
look
forward
to
you
know
she
talked
in
a
sweet
chirpy
voice
like
a
bird
there
were
pathetic
notes
in
it
too
as
the
girls
instinctively
felt
how
very
quaint
and
sweet
and
unworldly
she
was
mary
found
herself
feeling
indignant
at
cousin
abner
girls
whoever
they
were
for
their
neglect
we
are
out
for
a
spin
on
our
wheels
said
ida
and
we
are
very
thirsty
we
thought
perhaps
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
give
us
a
drink
of
water
oh
my
dear
anything
anything
i
have
is
at
your
service
said
the
little
lady
delightedly
if
you
will
come
in
i
will
get
you
some
lemonade
i
am
afraid
it
is
too
much
trouble
began
mary
oh
no
no
cried
the
little
lady
it
is
a
pleasure
i
love
doing
things
for
people
i
wish
more
of
them
would
come
to
give
me
the
chance
i
never
have
any
company
and
i
do
so
long
for
it
it
very
lonesome
here
at
golden
gate
oh
if
you
would
only
stay
to
tea
with
me
it
would
make
me
so
happy
i
am
all
prepared
i
prepare
every
saturday
morning
in
particular
so
that
if
cousin
abner
girls
did
come
i
would
be
all
ready
and
when
nobody
comes
juliana
and
i
have
to
eat
everything
up
ourselves
and
that
is
bad
for
us
it
gives
juliana
indigestion
if
you
would
only
stay
we
will
agreed
ida
promptly
and
we
glad
of
the
chance
we
are
both
terribly
hungry
and
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
ask
us
oh
indeed
it
is
it
just
selfishness
in
me
that
what
it
is
pure
selfishness
i
want
company
so
much
come
in
my
dears
and
i
suppose
i
must
introduce
myself
because
you
do
know
me
do
you
now
i
miss
sally
temple
and
this
is
golden
gate
cottage
dear
me
this
something
like
living
you
are
special
providences
that
you
are
indeed
she
whisked
them
through
a
quaint
little
parlour
where
everything
was
as
dainty
and
neat
and
as
herself
and
into
a
spare
bedroom
beyond
it
to
put
off
their
hats
now
just
excuse
me
a
minute
while
i
run
out
and
tell
juliana
that
we
are
going
to
have
company
to
tea
she
will
be
so
glad
juliana
will
make
yourselves
at
home
my
dears
is
she
delicious
said
mary
when
miss
sally
had
tripped
out
i
like
to
shake
cousin
abner
girls
this
is
what
dot
halliday
would
call
an
adventure
ida
is
it
miss
sally
and
this
quaint
old
spot
both
seem
like
a
chapter
out
of
the
novels
our
grandmothers
cried
over
look
here
mary
she
is
lonely
and
our
visit
seems
like
a
treat
to
her
let
us
try
to
make
it
one
let
just
chum
with
her
and
tell
her
all
about
ourselves
and
our
amusements
and
our
dresses
that
sounds
frivolous
but
you
know
what
i
mean
she
like
it
let
be
company
in
real
earnest
for
her
when
miss
sally
came
back
she
was
attended
by
juliana
carrying
a
tray
of
lemonade
glasses
juliana
proved
to
be
a
diminutive
lass
of
about
fourteen
whose
cheerful
freckled
face
wore
an
expansive
grin
of
pleasure
evidently
juliana
was
as
fond
of
company
as
her
mistress
was
afterwards
the
girls
overheard
a
subdued
colloquy
between
miss
sally
and
juliana
out
in
the
hall
go
set
the
table
juliana
and
put
on
grandmother
temple
wedding
china
be
sure
you
dust
it
carefully
and
the
best
tablecloth
and
be
sure
you
get
the
crease
straight
and
put
some
sweet
peas
in
the
centre
and
be
sure
they
are
fresh
i
want
everything
extra
nice
juliana
yes
miss
sally
i
see
to
it
is
it
great
to
have
company
miss
sally
whispered
juliana
the
seymour
girls
long
remembered
that
tea
table
and
the
delicacies
with
which
it
was
heaped
privately
they
did
not
wonder
that
juliana
had
indigestion
when
she
had
to
eat
many
such
unaided
being
hungry
they
did
full
justice
to
miss
sally
good
things
much
to
that
little
lady
delight
she
told
them
all
about
herself
she
had
lived
at
golden
gate
cottage
only
a
year
before
that
i
lived
away
down
the
country
at
millbridge
with
a
cousin
my
uncle
ephraim
owned
golden
gate
cottage
and
when
he
died
he
left
it
to
me
and
i
came
here
to
live
it
is
a
pretty
place
it
you
see
those
two
headlands
out
there
in
the
morning
when
the
sun
rises
the
water
between
them
is
just
a
sea
of
gold
and
that
is
why
uncle
ephraim
had
a
fancy
to
call
his
place
golden
gate
i
love
it
here
it
is
so
nice
to
have
a
home
of
my
own
i
would
be
quite
content
if
i
had
more
company
but
i
have
you
today
and
perhaps
beatrice
and
helen
will
come
next
week
so
i
really
a
great
deal
to
be
thankful
for
what
is
your
cousin
abner
other
name
asked
mary
with
a
vague
recollection
of
hearing
of
beatrice
and
helen
somebody
in
trenton
reed
abner
abimelech
reed
answered
miss
sally
promptly
reed
he
signs
himself
now
he
is
very
i
am
told
and
he
carries
on
business
in
town
he
was
a
very
fine
young
man
my
cousin
abner
i
do
know
his
wife
mary
and
ida
exchanged
glances
beatrice
and
helen
reed
they
knew
them
slightly
as
the
daughters
of
a
family
who
were
of
the
fashionable
society
in
trenton
they
were
regarded
as
decidedly
vulgar
and
so
far
their
efforts
to
gain
an
entry
into
the
exclusive
circle
where
the
seymours
and
their
like
revolved
had
not
been
very
successful
i
afraid
miss
sally
will
wait
a
long
while
before
she
sees
cousin
abner
girls
said
mary
when
they
had
gone
back
to
the
parlour
and
miss
sally
had
excused
herself
to
superintend
the
washing
of
grandmother
temple
wedding
china
they
probably
look
on
her
as
a
poor
relation
to
be
ignored
altogether
whereas
if
they
were
only
like
her
trenton
society
would
have
made
a
place
for
them
long
ago
the
seymour
girls
enjoyed
that
visit
as
much
as
miss
sally
did
she
was
eager
to
hear
all
about
their
girlish
lives
and
amusements
they
told
her
of
their
travels
of
famous
men
and
women
they
had
seen
of
parties
they
had
attended
the
dresses
they
wore
the
little
fads
and
hobbies
of
their
set
all
jumbled
up
together
and
all
listened
to
eagerly
by
miss
sally
and
also
by
juliana
who
was
permitted
to
sit
on
the
stairs
out
in
the
hall
and
so
gather
in
the
crumbs
of
this
intellectual
feast
oh
you
been
such
pleasant
company
said
miss
sally
when
the
girls
went
away
mary
took
the
little
lady
hands
in
hers
and
looked
affectionately
down
into
her
face
would
you
like
it
you
and
juliana
if
we
came
out
to
see
you
often
and
perhaps
brought
some
of
our
friends
with
us
oh
if
you
only
would
breathed
miss
sally
mary
laughed
and
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
bent
and
kissed
miss
sally
cheek
we
come
then
she
promised
please
look
upon
us
as
your
company
henceforth
the
girls
kept
their
word
thereafter
nearly
every
saturday
of
the
summer
found
them
taking
tea
with
miss
sally
at
golden
gate
sometimes
they
came
alone
sometimes
they
brought
other
girls
it
soon
became
a
decided
fad
in
their
set
to
go
to
see
miss
sally
everybody
who
met
her
loved
her
at
sight
it
was
considered
a
special
treat
to
be
taken
by
the
seymours
to
golden
gate
as
for
miss
sally
her
cup
of
happiness
was
almost
full
she
had
company
to
her
heart
content
and
of
the
very
kind
she
loved
bright
merry
girls
who
devoured
her
dainties
with
a
frank
zest
that
delighted
her
filled
the
quaint
old
rooms
with
laughter
and
life
and
chattered
to
her
of
all
their
plans
and
frolics
and
hopes
there
was
just
one
little
cloud
on
miss
sally
fair
sky
if
only
cousin
abner
girls
would
come
she
once
said
wistfully
to
mary
nobody
can
quite
take
the
place
of
one
own
you
know
my
heart
yearns
after
them
mary
was
very
silent
and
thoughtful
as
she
drove
back
to
trenton
that
night
two
days
afterwards
she
went
to
gardiner
lawn
party
the
reed
girls
were
there
they
were
tall
fair
handsome
girls
somewhat
too
lavishly
and
pronouncedly
dressed
in
expensive
gowns
and
hats
and
looking
as
they
felt
very
much
on
the
outside
of
things
they
brightened
and
bridled
however
when
gardiner
brought
mary
seymour
up
and
introduced
her
if
there
was
one
thing
on
earth
that
the
reed
girls
longed
for
more
than
another
it
was
to
get
in
with
the
seymour
girls
after
mary
had
chatted
with
them
for
a
few
minutes
in
a
friendly
way
she
said
i
think
we
have
a
mutual
friend
in
miss
sally
temple
of
golden
gate
have
we
i
sure
i
heard
her
speak
of
you
the
reed
girls
flushed
they
did
not
care
to
have
the
rich
seymour
girls
know
of
their
connection
with
that
queer
old
cousin
of
their
father
who
lived
in
that
spot
she
is
a
distant
cousin
of
ours
said
beatrice
carelessly
but
we
never
met
her
oh
how
much
you
have
missed
said
mary
frankly
she
is
the
sweetest
and
most
charming
little
lady
i
have
ever
met
and
i
am
proud
to
number
her
among
my
friends
golden
gate
is
such
an
idyllic
little
spot
too
we
go
there
so
often
that
i
fear
miss
sally
will
think
we
mean
to
outwear
our
welcome
we
hope
to
have
her
visit
us
in
town
this
winter
well
for
now
i
tell
miss
sally
i
met
you
she
will
be
pleased
to
hear
about
you
when
mary
had
gone
the
reed
girls
looked
at
each
other
i
suppose
we
ought
to
have
gone
to
see
cousin
sally
before
said
beatrice
father
said
we
ought
to
how
on
earth
did
the
seymours
pick
her
up
said
helen
of
course
we
must
go
and
see
her
go
they
did
the
very
next
day
miss
sally
cup
of
happiness
brimmed
right
over
for
cousin
abner
girls
came
to
golden
gate
at
last
they
were
very
nice
to
her
too
indeed
in
spite
of
a
good
deal
of
snobbishness
and
false
views
of
life
they
were
girls
under
it
all
and
some
plain
common
sense
they
had
inherited
from
their
father
came
to
the
surface
and
taught
them
to
see
that
miss
sally
was
a
relative
of
whom
anyone
might
be
proud
they
succumbed
to
her
charm
as
the
others
had
done
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
their
visit
to
golden
gate
they
went
away
promising
to
come
often
again
and
i
may
say
right
here
that
they
kept
their
promise
and
a
real
friendship
grew
up
between
miss
sally
and
cousin
abner
girls
that
was
destined
to
work
wonders
for
the
latter
not
only
socially
and
mentally
but
spiritually
as
well
for
it
taught
them
that
sincerity
and
honest
kindliness
of
heart
and
manner
are
the
best
passports
everywhere
and
that
pretence
of
any
kind
is
a
vulgarity
not
to
be
tolerated
this
took
time
of
course
the
reed
girls
could
not
discard
their
snobbishness
all
at
once
but
in
the
end
it
was
pretty
well
taken
out
of
them
miss
sally
never
dreamed
of
this
or
the
need
for
it
she
loved
cousin
abner
girls
from
the
first
and
always
admired
them
exceedingly
and
then
it
is
so
good
to
have
your
own
folks
coming
as
company
she
told
the
seymour
girls
oh
i
just
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
happiness
but
dearies
i
think
you
will
always
be
my
favourites
mine
and
juliana
i
plenty
of
company
now
and
it
all
thanks
to
you
oh
no
said
mary
quickly
miss
sally
your
company
comes
to
you
for
just
your
own
sake
you
made
golden
gate
a
veritable
mecca
for
us
all
you
do
know
and
you
never
will
know
how
much
good
you
have
done
us
you
are
so
good
and
true
and
sweet
that
we
girls
all
feel
as
if
we
were
bound
to
live
up
to
you
do
you
see
and
we
all
love
you
miss
sally
i
so
glad
breathed
miss
sally
with
shining
eyes
and
so
is
juliana
march
revenge
i
declare
it
is
a
real
fall
day
said
stapp
dropping
into
a
chair
with
a
sigh
of
relief
as
march
ushered
her
into
the
cosy
little
the
wind
would
chill
the
marrow
in
your
bones
winter
be
here
before
you
know
it
that
so
assented
march
bustling
about
to
stir
up
the
fire
but
i
do
know
as
i
mind
it
at
all
winter
is
real
pleasant
when
it
does
come
but
i
must
say
i
do
fancy
these
days
much
sit
up
to
the
fire
theodosia
you
look
real
blue
i
feel
so
too
lawful
heart
but
this
is
comfort
this
of
yours
anna
is
the
cosiest
spot
in
the
world
when
did
you
get
home
from
maitland
asked
march
did
you
have
a
pleasant
time
and
how
did
you
leave
emily
and
the
children
stapp
took
this
trio
of
interrogations
in
calm
detail
i
came
home
saturday
she
said
as
she
unrolled
her
knitting
nice
wet
day
it
was
too
and
as
for
my
visit
yes
i
enjoyed
myself
pretty
well
not
but
what
i
worried
over
peter
rheumatism
a
good
deal
emily
is
well
and
the
children
ought
to
be
for
such
rampageous
young
ones
i
never
saw
emily
ca
do
no
more
with
them
than
an
old
hen
with
a
brood
of
ducks
but
lawful
heart
anna
do
mind
about
my
little
affairs
the
news
peter
had
for
me
about
you
when
i
got
home
fairly
took
my
breath
he
came
down
to
the
garden
gate
to
shout
it
before
i
was
out
of
the
wagon
i
could
believe
but
what
he
was
joking
at
first
you
should
have
seen
peter
he
had
an
old
red
shawl
tied
round
his
rheumatic
shoulder
and
he
was
waving
his
arms
like
a
crazy
man
i
declare
i
thought
the
chimney
was
afire
theodosia
theodosia
he
shouted
march
has
had
a
fortune
left
her
by
her
brother
in
australy
and
she
bought
the
old
carroll
place
and
is
going
to
move
up
there
that
was
his
salute
when
i
got
home
i
have
been
over
before
this
to
hear
all
about
it
but
things
were
at
such
sixes
and
sevens
in
the
house
that
i
could
go
visiting
until
straightened
them
out
a
bit
peter
real
neat
as
men
go
but
lawful
heart
such
a
mess
as
he
makes
of
housekeeping
i
did
know
you
had
a
brother
living
no
more
did
i
theodosia
i
thought
as
everyone
else
did
that
poor
charles
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
forty
years
ago
it
that
long
since
he
ran
away
from
home
he
had
a
quarrel
with
father
and
he
was
always
dreadful
he
went
to
sea
and
we
heard
that
he
had
sailed
for
england
in
the
she
was
never
heard
of
after
and
we
all
supposed
that
my
poor
brother
had
perished
with
her
and
four
weeks
ago
i
got
a
letter
from
a
firm
of
lawyers
in
melbourne
australia
saying
that
my
brother
charles
bennett
had
died
and
left
all
his
fortune
to
me
i
could
believe
it
at
first
but
they
sent
me
some
things
of
his
that
he
had
when
he
left
home
and
there
was
an
old
picture
of
myself
among
them
with
my
name
written
on
it
in
my
own
hand
so
then
i
knew
there
was
no
mistake
but
whether
charles
did
sail
in
the
or
if
he
did
how
he
escaped
from
her
and
got
to
australia
i
do
know
and
it
is
likely
i
ever
will
well
of
all
wonderful
things
commented
stapp
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
i
was
heir
to
so
much
money
said
march
firmly
at
first
i
felt
as
if
it
were
awful
of
me
to
be
glad
when
it
came
to
me
by
my
brother
death
but
i
mourned
for
poor
charles
forty
years
ago
and
i
ca
sense
that
he
has
only
just
died
not
but
what
i
rather
have
seen
him
come
home
alive
than
have
all
the
money
in
the
world
but
it
has
come
about
otherwise
and
as
the
money
is
lawfully
mine
i
may
as
well
feel
pleased
about
it
and
you
bought
the
carroll
place
said
stapp
with
the
freedom
of
a
privileged
friend
whatever
made
you
do
it
i
sure
you
are
as
cosy
here
as
need
be
and
nobody
but
yourself
is
this
house
big
enough
for
you
no
it
is
all
my
life
i
been
hankering
for
a
good
big
roomy
house
and
all
my
life
i
had
to
put
up
with
little
boxes
of
places
not
big
enough
to
turn
round
in
i
been
contented
and
made
the
best
of
what
i
had
but
now
that
i
can
afford
it
i
mean
to
have
a
house
that
will
suit
me
the
carroll
house
is
just
what
i
want
for
all
it
is
a
little
i
always
had
a
notion
of
that
house
although
i
never
expected
to
own
it
any
more
than
the
moon
it
a
real
handsome
place
admitted
stapp
but
i
expect
it
will
need
a
lot
of
fixing
up
nobody
has
lived
in
it
for
six
years
when
are
you
going
to
move
in
in
about
three
weeks
if
all
goes
well
i
having
it
all
painted
and
done
over
inside
the
outside
can
wait
until
the
spring
it
queer
how
things
come
about
said
stapp
meditatively
i
guess
old
carroll
never
imagined
her
home
was
going
to
pass
into
other
folks
hands
as
it
has
when
you
and
i
were
girls
and
louise
carroll
was
giving
herself
such
airs
over
us
you
did
much
expect
to
ever
stand
in
her
shoes
did
you
do
you
remember
lou
yes
i
do
said
march
sharply
a
change
came
over
her
sonsy
smiling
face
it
actually
looked
hard
and
revengeful
and
a
cruel
light
flickered
in
her
dark
brown
eyes
i
not
forget
lou
carroll
as
long
as
i
live
she
is
the
only
person
in
this
world
i
ever
hated
i
suppose
it
is
sinful
to
say
it
but
i
hate
her
still
and
always
will
i
never
liked
her
myself
admitted
stapp
she
thought
herself
above
us
all
well
for
that
matter
i
suppose
she
was
but
she
have
rubbed
it
in
so
well
she
might
have
been
above
me
said
march
bitterly
but
she
was
above
twitting
and
snubbing
me
every
chance
she
got
she
always
had
a
spite
at
me
from
the
time
we
were
children
together
at
school
when
we
grew
up
it
was
worse
i
could
begin
to
tell
you
all
the
times
that
girl
insulted
me
but
there
was
once
in
particular
never
forgive
her
for
it
i
was
at
a
party
and
she
was
there
too
and
so
was
that
young
trenham
manning
who
was
visiting
the
ashleys
do
you
remember
him
dosia
he
was
a
handsome
young
fellow
and
lou
had
a
liking
for
him
so
all
the
girls
said
but
he
never
looked
at
her
that
night
and
he
kept
by
me
the
whole
time
it
made
lou
furious
and
at
last
she
came
up
to
me
with
a
sneer
on
her
face
and
her
black
eyes
just
snapping
and
said
bennett
mother
told
me
to
tell
you
to
tell
your
ma
that
if
that
plain
sewing
is
done
by
tomorrow
night
she
send
for
it
and
give
it
to
somebody
else
if
people
engage
to
have
work
done
by
a
certain
time
and
do
keep
their
word
they
need
expect
to
get
it
oh
how
badly
i
felt
mother
and
i
were
poor
and
had
to
work
hard
but
we
had
feelings
just
like
other
people
and
to
be
insulted
like
that
before
trenham
manning
i
just
burst
out
crying
then
and
there
and
ran
away
and
hid
it
was
very
silly
of
me
but
i
could
help
it
that
stings
me
yet
if
i
was
ever
to
get
a
chance
to
pay
lou
carroll
out
for
that
i
take
it
without
any
compunction
oh
but
that
is
unchristian
protested
stapp
feebly
perhaps
so
but
it
the
way
i
feel
old
parson
jones
used
to
say
that
people
were
marbled
good
and
bad
pretty
even
but
that
in
everybody
there
were
one
or
two
streaks
just
pure
wicked
i
guess
lou
carroll
is
my
wicked
streak
i
have
seen
or
heard
of
her
for
years
ever
since
she
married
that
worthless
dency
baxter
and
went
away
she
may
be
dead
for
all
i
know
i
do
expect
ever
to
have
a
chance
to
pay
her
out
but
mark
what
i
say
theodosia
if
i
ever
have
i
will
march
snipped
off
her
thread
as
if
she
challenged
the
world
stapp
felt
uncomfortable
over
the
unusual
display
of
feeling
she
had
evoked
and
hastened
to
change
the
subject
in
three
weeks
time
march
was
established
in
her
new
home
and
the
old
carroll
house
blossomed
out
into
renewed
splendour
theodosia
stapp
who
had
dropped
in
to
see
it
was
in
a
rapture
of
admiration
you
have
a
lovely
home
now
anna
i
used
to
think
it
fine
enough
in
the
carrolls
time
but
it
was
as
grand
as
this
and
that
reminds
me
i
have
something
to
tell
you
but
i
do
want
you
to
get
as
excited
as
you
did
the
last
time
i
mentioned
her
name
you
remember
the
last
day
i
was
to
see
you
we
were
talking
of
lou
carroll
well
next
day
i
was
downtown
in
a
store
and
who
should
sail
in
but
joel
kent
from
oriental
you
know
joel
sarah
chapple
that
was
she
and
her
man
keep
a
little
hotel
up
at
oriental
they
not
very
well
off
she
is
a
cousin
of
old
carroll
but
lawful
heart
the
carrolls
did
used
to
make
much
of
the
relationship
well
joel
and
i
had
a
chat
she
told
me
all
her
troubles
she
always
has
lots
of
them
sarah
was
always
of
a
grumbling
turn
and
she
had
a
stock
of
them
this
time
what
do
you
think
anna
march
lou
carroll
or
baxter
i
suppose
i
should
say
is
up
there
at
joel
kent
at
oriental
dying
of
consumption
leastwise
joel
says
she
is
lou
carroll
dying
at
oriental
cried
march
yes
she
came
there
from
goodness
knows
where
about
a
month
ago
might
as
well
have
dropped
from
the
clouds
joel
says
for
all
she
expected
of
it
her
husband
is
dead
and
i
guess
he
led
her
a
life
of
it
when
he
was
alive
and
she
as
poor
as
second
skimmings
she
was
aiming
to
come
here
joel
says
but
when
she
got
to
oriental
she
was
fit
to
stir
a
step
further
and
the
kents
had
to
keep
her
i
gather
from
what
joel
said
that
she
rather
touched
in
her
mind
too
and
has
an
awful
hankering
to
get
home
here
to
this
very
house
she
appears
to
have
the
idea
that
it
is
hers
and
all
just
the
same
as
it
used
to
be
i
guess
she
is
a
sight
of
trouble
and
joel
ai
the
woman
to
like
that
but
there
she
has
to
work
most
awful
hard
and
i
suppose
a
sick
person
does
come
handy
in
a
hotel
i
guess
you
got
your
revenge
anna
without
lifting
a
finger
to
get
it
think
of
lou
carroll
coming
to
that
the
next
day
was
cold
and
raw
the
ragged
bare
trees
in
the
old
carroll
grounds
shook
and
writhed
in
the
gusts
of
wind
now
and
then
a
drifting
scud
of
rain
dashed
across
the
windows
march
looked
out
with
a
shiver
and
turned
thankfully
to
her
own
cosy
fireside
again
presently
she
thought
she
heard
a
low
knock
at
the
front
door
and
went
to
see
as
she
opened
it
a
savage
swirl
of
damp
wind
rushed
in
and
the
shrinking
figure
leaning
against
one
of
the
fluted
columns
of
the
grecian
porch
seemed
to
cower
before
its
fury
it
was
a
woman
who
stood
there
a
woman
whose
emaciated
face
wore
a
piteous
expression
as
she
lifted
it
to
march
you
do
know
me
of
course
she
said
with
a
feeble
attempt
at
dignity
i
am
baxter
i
i
used
to
live
here
long
ago
i
thought
i
walk
over
today
and
see
my
old
home
a
fit
of
coughing
interrupted
her
words
and
she
trembled
like
a
leaf
gracious
me
exclaimed
march
blankly
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
have
walked
over
from
oriental
today
and
you
a
sick
woman
for
pity
sake
come
in
quick
and
if
you
not
wet
to
the
skin
she
fairly
pulled
her
visitor
into
the
hall
and
led
her
to
the
sit
down
take
this
big
right
up
to
the
fire
so
let
me
take
your
bonnet
and
shawl
i
must
run
right
out
to
tell
hannah
to
get
you
a
hot
drink
you
are
very
kind
whispered
the
other
i
do
know
you
but
you
look
like
a
woman
i
used
to
know
when
i
was
a
girl
she
was
a
bennett
and
she
had
a
daughter
anna
do
you
know
what
became
of
her
i
forget
i
forget
everything
now
my
name
is
march
said
march
briefly
ignoring
the
question
i
do
suppose
you
ever
heard
it
before
she
wrapped
her
own
warm
shawl
about
the
other
woman
thin
shoulders
then
she
hastened
to
the
kitchen
and
soon
returned
carrying
a
tray
of
food
and
a
steaming
hot
drink
she
wheeled
a
small
table
up
to
her
visitor
side
and
said
very
kindly
now
take
a
bite
my
dear
and
this
raspberry
vinegar
will
warm
you
right
up
it
is
a
dreadful
day
for
you
to
be
out
why
on
earth
joel
kent
drive
you
over
they
did
know
i
was
coming
whispered
baxter
anxiously
i
i
ran
away
sarah
would
have
let
me
come
if
she
had
known
but
i
wanted
to
come
so
much
it
is
so
nice
to
be
home
again
march
watched
her
guest
as
she
ate
and
drank
it
was
plain
enough
that
her
mind
or
rather
her
memory
was
affected
she
did
not
realize
that
this
was
no
longer
her
home
at
moments
she
seemed
to
fancy
herself
back
in
the
past
again
once
or
twice
she
called
march
mother
presently
a
sharp
knock
was
heard
at
the
hall
door
march
excused
herself
and
went
out
in
the
porch
stood
theodosia
stapp
and
a
woman
whom
march
did
not
at
first
glance
recognize
a
tall
person
whose
sharp
black
eyes
darted
in
past
march
and
searched
every
corner
of
the
hall
before
anyone
had
time
to
speak
lawful
heart
puffed
stapp
as
she
stepped
in
out
of
the
biting
wind
i
right
out
of
breath
march
allow
me
to
introduce
kent
we
looking
for
baxter
she
has
run
away
and
we
thought
perhaps
she
came
here
did
she
she
is
in
my
now
said
march
quietly
did
i
say
so
demanded
kent
turning
to
stapp
she
spoke
in
a
sharp
tone
that
grated
on
nerves
does
she
beat
all
she
slipped
away
this
morning
when
i
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
and
to
think
of
her
walking
six
miles
over
here
in
this
wind
i
dunno
how
she
did
it
i
do
believe
she
half
as
sick
as
she
pretends
well
i
got
my
wagon
out
here
march
and
i
be
much
obliged
if
you
tell
her
i
here
to
take
her
home
i
we
have
a
fearful
scene
i
do
see
that
there
is
any
call
for
a
scene
said
march
firmly
the
poor
woman
has
just
got
here
and
she
thinks
she
has
got
home
she
might
as
well
think
so
if
it
is
of
any
comfort
to
her
better
leave
her
here
theodosia
gave
a
stifled
gasp
of
amazement
but
march
went
serenely
on
i
take
care
of
the
poor
soul
as
long
as
she
needs
it
and
that
will
not
be
very
long
in
my
opinion
for
if
ever
i
saw
death
in
a
woman
face
it
is
looking
out
of
hers
i
plenty
of
time
to
look
after
her
and
make
her
comfortable
joel
kent
was
voluble
in
her
thanks
it
was
evident
that
she
was
delighted
to
get
the
sick
woman
off
her
hands
march
cut
her
short
with
an
invitation
to
stay
to
tea
but
kent
declined
i
got
to
hurry
home
straight
off
and
get
the
men
suppers
such
a
scamper
to
have
over
that
woman
i
sure
i
thankful
you
willing
to
let
her
stay
for
she
never
be
contented
anywhere
else
i
send
over
what
few
things
she
has
tomorrow
when
kent
had
gone
march
and
stapp
looked
at
each
other
and
so
this
is
your
revenge
anna
march
said
the
latter
solemnly
do
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
about
her
yes
i
do
theodosia
and
i
thought
i
meant
every
word
of
it
but
i
guess
my
wicked
streak
ran
out
just
when
i
needed
it
to
depend
on
besides
you
see
i
thought
of
lou
carroll
all
these
years
as
she
was
when
i
knew
her
handsome
and
saucy
and
proud
but
that
poor
creature
in
there
is
any
more
like
the
lou
carroll
i
knew
than
you
are
not
a
mite
the
old
lou
carroll
is
dead
already
and
my
spite
is
dead
with
her
will
you
come
in
and
see
her
well
no
not
just
now
she
would
know
me
and
joel
says
strangers
kind
of
excite
her
a
pretty
bad
place
the
hotel
would
be
for
her
at
that
rate
i
should
think
i
must
go
and
tell
peter
about
it
and
i
send
up
some
of
my
black
currant
jam
for
her
when
stapp
had
gone
march
went
back
to
her
guest
lou
baxter
had
fallen
asleep
with
her
head
pillowed
on
the
soft
plush
back
of
her
chair
march
looked
at
the
hollow
hectic
cheeks
and
the
changed
wasted
features
and
her
bright
brown
eyes
softened
with
tears
poor
lou
she
said
softly
as
she
brushed
a
loose
lock
of
grey
hair
back
from
the
sleeping
woman
brow
nan
nan
was
polishing
the
tumblers
at
the
pantry
window
outside
of
which
john
osborne
was
leaning
among
the
vines
his
arms
were
folded
on
the
sill
and
his
straw
hat
was
pushed
back
from
his
flushed
eager
face
as
he
watched
nan
deft
movements
beyond
them
old
abe
stewart
was
mowing
the
grass
in
the
orchard
with
a
scythe
and
casting
uneasy
glances
at
the
pair
old
abe
did
not
approve
of
john
osborne
as
a
suitor
for
nan
john
was
poor
and
old
abe
although
he
was
the
wealthiest
farmer
in
granville
was
bent
on
nan
making
a
good
match
he
looked
upon
john
osborne
as
a
mere
and
it
was
a
thorn
in
the
flesh
to
see
him
talking
to
nan
while
he
old
abe
was
too
far
away
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
he
had
a
good
deal
of
confidence
in
nan
she
was
a
sensible
girl
still
there
was
no
knowing
what
freak
even
a
sensible
girl
might
take
into
her
head
and
nan
was
so
determined
when
she
did
make
up
her
mind
she
was
his
own
daughter
in
that
however
old
abe
need
not
have
worried
himself
it
could
not
be
said
that
nan
was
helping
john
osborne
on
in
his
wooing
at
all
instead
she
was
teasing
and
snubbing
him
by
turns
nan
was
very
pretty
moreover
nan
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
she
knew
that
the
way
her
dark
hair
curled
around
her
ears
and
forehead
was
bewitching
that
her
complexion
was
the
envy
of
every
girl
in
granville
that
her
long
lashes
had
a
trick
of
drooping
over
very
soft
dark
eyes
in
a
fashion
calculated
to
turn
masculine
heads
hopelessly
john
osborne
knew
all
this
too
to
his
cost
he
had
called
to
ask
nan
to
go
with
him
to
the
lone
lake
picnic
the
next
day
at
this
request
nan
dropped
her
eyes
and
murmured
that
she
was
sorry
but
he
was
too
late
she
had
promised
to
go
with
somebody
else
there
was
no
need
of
nan
making
such
a
mystery
about
it
the
somebody
else
was
her
only
cousin
ned
bennett
who
had
had
a
quarrel
with
his
own
girl
the
latter
lived
at
lone
lake
and
ned
had
coaxed
nan
to
go
over
with
him
and
try
her
hand
at
patching
matters
up
between
him
and
his
offended
and
nan
who
was
an
amiable
creature
and
where
anybody
lover
except
her
own
was
concerned
had
agreed
to
go
but
john
osborne
at
once
jumped
to
the
conclusion
as
nan
had
very
possibly
meant
him
to
do
that
the
mysterious
somebody
was
bryan
lee
and
the
thought
was
gall
and
wormwood
to
him
whom
are
you
going
with
he
asked
that
would
be
telling
nan
said
with
maddening
indifference
is
it
bryan
lee
demanded
john
it
might
be
said
nan
reflectively
and
then
again
you
know
it
might
john
was
silent
he
was
no
match
for
nan
when
it
came
to
a
war
of
words
he
scowled
moodily
at
the
shining
tumblers
nan
i
going
out
west
he
said
finally
nan
stared
at
him
with
her
last
tumbler
poised
in
very
much
as
if
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
going
to
the
north
pole
or
equatorial
africa
john
osborne
are
you
crazy
not
quite
and
i
in
earnest
i
can
tell
you
that
nan
set
the
glass
down
with
a
decided
thud
john
curtness
displeased
her
he
need
suppose
that
it
made
any
difference
to
her
if
he
took
it
into
his
stupid
head
to
go
to
afghanistan
oh
she
remarked
carelessly
well
i
suppose
if
you
got
the
western
fever
your
case
is
hopeless
would
it
be
impertinent
to
inquire
why
you
are
going
there
nothing
else
for
me
to
do
nan
said
john
bryan
lee
is
going
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
next
month
and
i
have
to
clear
out
he
says
he
ca
wait
any
longer
i
worked
hard
enough
and
done
my
best
to
keep
the
old
place
but
it
been
uphill
work
and
i
beaten
at
last
nan
sat
blankly
down
on
the
stool
by
the
window
her
face
was
a
study
which
john
osborne
watching
old
abe
movements
missed
well
i
never
she
gasped
john
osborne
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
bryan
lee
is
going
to
do
that
how
did
he
come
to
get
your
mortgage
bought
it
from
old
townsend
answered
john
briefly
oh
he
within
his
rights
i
admit
i
even
got
behind
with
the
interest
this
past
year
i
go
out
west
and
begin
over
again
it
a
burning
shame
said
nan
violently
john
looked
around
in
time
to
see
two
very
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
you
do
care
though
nan
i
do
like
to
see
anyone
unjustly
treated
declared
nan
and
that
is
what
you
been
you
never
had
half
a
chance
and
after
the
way
you
slaved
too
if
lee
would
wait
a
little
i
might
do
something
yet
now
that
aunt
alice
is
gone
said
john
bitterly
i
not
afraid
of
work
but
he
wo
he
means
to
take
his
spite
out
at
last
nan
hesitated
surely
bryan
is
so
mean
as
that
she
stammered
perhaps
change
his
mind
if
if
osborne
wheeled
about
with
face
aflame
do
you
say
a
word
to
him
about
it
nan
he
cried
do
you
go
interceding
with
him
for
me
i
got
some
pride
left
he
can
take
the
farm
from
me
and
he
can
take
you
maybe
but
he
ca
take
my
i
wo
beg
him
for
mercy
do
you
dare
to
say
a
word
to
him
about
it
nan
eyes
flashed
she
was
offended
to
find
her
sympathy
flung
back
in
her
face
do
be
alarmed
she
said
tartly
i
sha
bother
myself
about
your
concerns
i
no
doubt
you
able
to
look
out
for
them
yourself
osborne
turned
away
as
he
did
so
he
saw
bryan
lee
driving
up
the
lane
perhaps
nan
saw
it
too
at
any
rate
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
john
john
osborne
half
turned
you
be
up
again
soon
you
his
face
hardened
i
come
to
say
goodbye
before
i
go
of
course
he
answered
shortly
he
came
face
to
face
with
lee
at
the
gate
where
the
latter
was
tying
his
sleek
chestnut
to
a
poplar
he
acknowledged
his
condescending
nod
with
a
scowl
lee
looked
after
him
with
a
satisfied
smile
poor
beggar
he
muttered
he
feels
pretty
cheap
i
reckon
spoiled
his
chances
in
this
quarter
old
abe
does
want
any
about
his
place
and
nan
wo
dream
of
taking
him
when
she
knows
he
has
a
roof
over
his
head
he
stopped
for
a
chat
with
old
abe
old
abe
approved
of
bryan
lee
he
was
a
after
old
abe
heart
meanwhile
nan
had
seated
herself
at
the
pantry
window
and
was
ostentatiously
hemming
towels
in
apparent
oblivion
of
suitor
no
nevertheless
when
bryan
came
up
she
greeted
him
with
an
unusually
sweet
smile
and
at
once
plunged
into
an
animated
conversation
bryan
had
not
come
to
ask
her
to
go
to
the
picnic
business
prevented
him
from
going
but
he
meant
to
find
out
if
she
were
going
with
john
osborne
as
nan
was
serenely
impervious
to
all
hints
he
was
finally
forced
to
ask
her
bluntly
if
she
was
going
to
the
picnic
well
yes
she
expected
to
oh
might
he
ask
with
whom
nan
did
know
that
it
was
a
question
of
public
interest
at
all
it
is
with
that
osborne
fellow
is
it
demanded
bryan
incautiously
nan
tossed
her
head
well
why
not
she
asked
look
here
nan
said
lee
angrily
if
you
going
to
the
picnic
with
john
osborne
i
surprised
at
you
what
do
you
mean
by
encouraging
him
so
he
as
poor
as
job
turkey
i
suppose
heard
that
i
been
compelled
to
foreclose
the
mortgage
on
his
farm
nan
kept
her
temper
sweetly
a
dangerous
sign
had
bryan
but
known
it
yes
he
was
telling
me
so
this
morning
she
answered
slowly
oh
was
he
i
suppose
he
gave
me
my
character
no
he
did
say
very
much
about
it
at
all
he
said
of
course
you
were
within
your
rights
but
do
you
really
mean
to
do
it
bryan
of
course
i
do
said
bryan
promptly
i
ca
wait
any
longer
for
my
money
and
i
never
get
it
if
i
did
osborne
ca
even
pay
the
interest
it
is
because
he
has
worked
hard
enough
then
said
nan
he
has
just
slaved
on
that
place
ever
since
he
grew
up
well
yes
he
has
worked
hard
in
a
way
but
he
kind
of
shiftless
for
all
that
no
manager
as
you
might
say
some
folks
would
have
been
clear
by
now
but
osborne
is
one
of
those
men
that
are
bound
to
get
behind
he
has
got
any
business
faculty
he
is
shiftless
said
nan
quickly
and
it
is
his
fault
if
he
has
got
behind
it
all
because
of
his
care
for
his
aunt
he
has
had
to
spend
more
on
her
doctor
bills
than
would
have
raised
the
mortgage
and
now
that
she
is
dead
and
he
might
have
a
chance
to
pull
up
you
go
and
foreclose
a
man
must
look
out
for
number
one
said
bryan
easily
admiring
nan
downcast
eyes
and
rosy
cheeks
i
have
any
spite
against
osborne
but
business
is
business
you
know
nan
opened
her
lips
to
say
something
but
remembering
parting
injunction
she
shut
them
again
she
shot
a
scornful
glance
at
lee
as
he
stood
with
his
arms
folded
on
the
sill
beside
her
bryan
lingered
talking
small
talk
until
nan
announced
that
she
must
see
about
getting
tea
and
you
wo
tell
me
who
is
going
to
take
you
to
the
picnic
he
coaxed
oh
it
ned
bennett
said
nan
indifferently
bryan
felt
relieved
he
unpinned
the
huge
cluster
of
violets
on
his
coat
and
laid
them
down
on
the
sill
beside
her
before
he
went
nan
flicked
them
off
with
her
fingers
as
she
watched
him
cross
the
lawn
his
own
smile
upon
his
face
a
week
later
the
osborne
homestead
had
passed
into
bryan
lee
hands
and
john
osborne
was
staying
with
his
cousin
at
thornhope
pending
his
departure
for
the
west
he
had
never
been
to
see
nan
since
that
last
afternoon
but
bryan
lee
haunted
the
stewart
place
one
day
he
suddenly
stopped
coming
and
although
nan
was
discreetly
silent
in
due
time
it
came
to
old
abe
ears
by
various
driblets
of
gossip
that
nan
had
refused
him
old
abe
marched
straightway
home
to
nan
in
a
fury
and
demanded
if
this
were
true
nan
curtly
admitted
that
it
was
old
abe
was
so
much
taken
aback
by
her
coolness
that
he
asked
almost
meekly
what
was
her
reason
for
doing
such
a
fool
trick
because
he
turned
john
osborne
out
of
house
and
home
returned
nan
composedly
if
he
had
done
that
there
is
no
telling
what
might
have
happened
i
might
even
have
married
him
because
i
liked
him
very
well
and
it
would
have
pleased
you
at
any
rate
i
would
have
married
john
when
you
were
against
him
now
i
mean
to
old
abe
stormed
furiously
at
this
but
nan
kept
so
provokingly
cool
that
he
was
conscious
of
wasting
breath
he
went
off
in
a
rage
but
nan
did
not
feel
particularly
anxious
now
that
the
announcement
was
over
he
would
cool
down
she
knew
john
osborne
worried
her
more
she
did
see
clearly
how
she
was
to
marry
him
unless
he
asked
her
and
he
had
studiously
avoided
her
since
the
foreclosure
but
nan
did
not
mean
to
be
baffled
or
to
let
her
lover
slip
through
her
fingers
for
want
of
a
little
courage
she
was
not
old
abe
stewart
daughter
for
nothing
one
day
ned
bennett
dropped
in
and
said
that
john
osborne
would
start
for
the
west
in
three
days
that
evening
nan
went
up
to
her
room
and
dressed
herself
in
the
prettiest
dress
she
owned
combed
her
hair
around
her
sparkling
face
in
bewitching
curls
pinned
a
cluster
of
apple
blossoms
at
her
belt
and
thus
equipped
marched
down
in
the
golden
sunset
light
to
the
mill
creek
bridge
john
osborne
on
his
return
from
thornhope
half
an
hour
later
found
her
there
leaning
over
the
rail
among
the
willows
nan
started
in
surprise
and
then
asked
him
why
he
had
not
been
to
see
her
john
blushed
stammered
did
know
had
been
busy
nan
cut
short
his
halting
excuses
by
demanding
to
know
if
he
were
really
going
away
and
what
he
intended
to
do
i
go
out
on
the
prairies
and
take
up
a
claim
said
osborne
sturdily
begin
life
over
again
free
of
debt
it
be
hard
work
but
i
not
afraid
of
that
i
will
succeed
if
it
takes
me
years
they
walked
on
in
silence
nan
came
to
the
conclusion
that
osborne
meant
to
hold
his
peace
john
she
said
tremulously
wo
wo
you
find
it
very
lonely
out
there
of
course
i
expect
that
i
shall
have
to
get
used
to
it
nan
grew
nervous
proposing
to
a
man
was
really
very
dreadful
would
it
be
nicer
for
you
she
faltered
that
is
it
be
so
lonely
for
you
would
it
if
if
you
had
me
out
there
with
you
john
osborne
stopped
squarely
in
the
dusty
road
and
looked
at
her
nan
he
exclaimed
oh
if
you
ca
take
a
hint
said
nan
in
despair
it
was
all
of
an
hour
later
that
a
man
drove
past
them
as
they
loitered
up
the
hill
road
in
the
twilight
it
was
bryan
lee
he
had
taken
from
osborne
his
house
and
land
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
take
nan
stewart
after
all
natty
of
blue
point
natty
miller
strolled
down
to
the
wharf
where
bliss
ford
was
tying
up
the
bliss
was
scowling
darkly
at
the
boat
a
trim
new
one
painted
white
whose
furled
sails
seemed
unaccountably
wet
and
whose
glistening
interior
likewise
dripped
with
moisture
a
group
of
fishermen
on
the
wharf
were
shaking
their
heads
sagely
as
natty
drew
near
might
as
well
split
her
up
for
kindlings
bliss
said
jake
mclaren
you
never
get
men
to
sail
in
her
it
passed
the
first
time
seeing
as
only
young
johnson
was
skipper
but
when
a
boat
turns
turtle
with
captain
frank
in
command
there
something
serious
wrong
with
her
what
up
asked
natty
the
upset
out
in
the
bay
again
this
morning
answered
will
scott
that
the
second
time
the
picked
up
the
men
and
towed
her
in
it
no
use
trying
to
sail
her
lobstermen
going
to
risk
their
lives
in
a
boat
like
that
how
things
over
at
blue
point
natty
pretty
well
responded
natty
laconically
natty
never
wasted
words
he
had
not
talked
a
great
deal
in
his
fourteen
years
of
life
but
he
was
much
given
to
thinking
he
was
rather
undersized
and
insignificant
looking
but
there
were
a
few
boys
of
his
own
age
on
the
mainland
who
knew
that
natty
had
muscles
has
everett
heard
anything
from
ottawa
about
the
lighthouse
business
yet
asked
will
natty
shook
his
head
think
he
any
chance
of
getting
the
queried
adam
lewis
not
the
ghost
of
a
chance
said
cooper
creasy
decidedly
he
on
the
wrong
side
of
politics
that
what
er
rather
his
father
was
a
tory
son
ai
going
to
get
an
from
a
government
that
what
barr
says
that
everett
is
too
young
to
be
trusted
in
such
a
responsible
position
quoted
natty
gravely
cooper
shrugged
his
shoulders
mebbe
mebbe
eighteen
is
kind
of
green
but
everybody
knows
that
ev
been
the
real
lighthouse
keeper
for
two
years
since
your
father
took
sick
irving
elliott
wants
that
light
has
wanted
it
for
years
and
he
a
pretty
strong
pull
at
headquarters
that
what
barr
owes
him
something
for
years
of
hard
work
at
elections
i
saying
anything
against
elliott
either
he
a
good
man
but
your
father
son
ought
to
have
that
light
as
sure
as
he
wo
get
it
that
what
any
of
you
going
to
take
in
the
sports
tomorrow
down
at
summerside
asked
will
scott
in
order
to
switch
cooper
away
from
politics
which
were
apt
to
excite
him
i
going
for
one
said
adam
there
to
be
a
yacht
race
atween
the
summerside
and
charlottetown
boat
clubs
yes
i
am
going
give
you
a
chance
down
to
the
station
natty
if
you
want
one
natty
shook
his
head
not
going
he
said
briefly
you
should
celebrate
victoria
day
said
adam
patriotically
o
may
the
queen
birthday
ef
we
do
get
a
holiday
we
all
run
away
as
we
used
to
say
at
school
the
good
old
queen
is
dead
but
the
day
been
a
national
holiday
in
honour
of
her
memory
and
you
should
celebrate
it
becoming
ev
and
i
ca
both
go
and
he
going
explained
natty
prue
and
i
stay
home
to
light
up
must
be
getting
back
now
looks
squally
i
misdoubt
if
we
have
queen
weather
tomorrow
said
cooper
squinting
critically
at
the
sky
looks
like
a
northeast
blow
what
there
goes
bliss
striding
off
and
looking
pretty
mad
the
a
dead
loss
to
him
that
what
nat
off
he
knows
how
to
handle
a
boat
middling
well
too
pity
he
such
a
puny
youngster
not
much
to
him
i
reckon
natty
had
cast
loose
in
his
boat
the
and
hoisted
his
sail
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
skimming
gaily
down
the
bay
the
wind
was
fair
and
piping
and
the
went
like
a
bird
natty
at
the
rudder
steered
for
blue
point
island
a
reflective
frown
on
his
face
he
was
feeling
in
no
mood
for
victoria
day
sports
in
a
very
short
time
he
and
ev
and
prue
must
leave
blue
point
lighthouse
where
they
had
lived
all
their
lives
to
natty
it
seemed
as
if
the
end
of
all
things
would
come
then
where
would
life
be
worth
living
away
from
lonely
windy
blue
point
island
david
miller
had
died
the
preceding
winter
after
a
long
illness
he
had
been
lighthouse
keeper
at
blue
point
for
thirty
years
his
three
children
had
been
born
and
brought
up
there
and
there
four
years
ago
the
mother
had
died
but
womanly
little
prue
had
taken
her
place
well
and
the
boys
were
devoted
to
their
sister
when
their
father
died
everett
had
applied
for
the
position
of
lighthouse
keeper
the
matter
was
not
yet
publicly
decided
but
old
cooper
creasy
had
sized
the
situation
up
accurately
the
millers
had
no
real
hope
that
everett
would
be
appointed
victoria
day
while
not
absolutely
stormy
proved
to
be
rather
unpleasant
a
choppy
northeast
wind
blew
up
the
bay
and
the
water
was
rough
enough
the
sky
was
overcast
with
clouds
and
the
may
air
was
raw
and
chilly
at
blue
point
the
millers
were
early
astir
for
if
everett
wanted
to
sail
over
to
the
mainland
in
time
to
catch
the
excursion
train
no
morning
naps
were
permissible
he
was
going
alone
since
only
one
of
the
boys
could
go
natty
had
insisted
that
it
should
be
everett
and
prue
had
elected
to
stay
home
with
natty
prue
had
small
heart
for
victoria
day
that
year
she
did
not
feel
even
a
thrill
of
enthusiasm
when
natty
hoisted
a
flag
and
wreathed
the
picture
with
creeping
spruce
prue
felt
as
badly
about
leaving
blue
point
island
as
the
boys
did
the
day
passed
slowly
in
the
afternoon
the
wind
fell
away
to
a
dead
calm
but
there
was
still
a
heavy
swell
on
and
shortly
before
sunset
a
fog
came
creeping
up
from
the
east
and
spread
over
the
bay
and
islands
so
thick
and
white
that
prue
and
natty
could
not
even
see
little
bear
island
on
the
right
i
glad
everett
is
coming
back
tonight
said
prue
he
could
never
find
his
way
cross
the
harbour
in
that
fog
is
it
thick
though
said
natty
the
light
wo
show
far
tonight
at
sunset
they
lighted
the
great
lamps
and
then
settled
down
to
an
evening
of
reading
but
it
was
not
long
before
natty
looked
up
from
his
book
to
say
hello
prue
what
was
that
thought
i
heard
a
noise
so
did
i
said
prue
i
sounded
like
someone
calling
they
hurried
to
the
door
which
looked
out
on
the
harbour
the
night
owing
to
the
fog
was
dark
with
a
darkness
that
seemed
almost
tangible
from
somewhere
out
of
that
darkness
came
a
muffled
shouting
like
that
of
a
person
in
distress
prue
there
somebody
in
trouble
out
there
exclaimed
natty
oh
it
surely
never
ev
cried
prue
natty
shook
his
head
do
think
so
ev
had
no
intention
of
coming
back
tonight
get
that
lantern
prue
i
must
go
and
see
what
and
who
it
is
oh
natty
you
must
cried
prue
in
distress
there
a
heavy
swell
on
yet
and
the
fog
oh
if
you
get
lost
i
not
get
lost
and
i
must
go
prue
maybe
somebody
is
drowning
out
there
it
not
ev
of
course
but
suppose
it
were
that
a
good
girl
prue
with
set
face
had
brought
the
lantern
resolutely
choking
back
the
words
of
fear
and
protest
that
rushed
to
her
lips
they
hurried
down
to
the
shore
and
natty
sprang
into
the
little
skiff
he
used
for
rowing
he
hastily
lashed
the
lantern
in
the
stern
cast
loose
the
painter
and
lifted
the
oars
i
be
back
as
soon
as
possible
he
called
to
prue
wait
here
for
me
in
a
minute
the
shore
was
out
of
sight
and
natty
found
himself
alone
in
the
black
fog
with
no
guide
but
the
cries
for
help
which
already
were
becoming
fainter
they
seemed
to
come
from
the
direction
of
little
bear
and
thither
natty
rowed
it
was
a
tough
pull
and
the
water
was
rough
enough
for
the
little
dory
but
natty
had
been
at
home
with
the
oars
from
babyhood
and
his
long
training
and
tough
sinews
stood
him
in
good
stead
now
steadily
and
intrepidly
he
rowed
along
the
water
grew
rougher
as
he
passed
out
from
the
shelter
of
blue
point
into
the
channel
between
the
latter
and
little
bear
the
cries
were
becoming
very
faint
what
if
he
should
be
too
late
he
bent
to
the
oars
with
all
his
energy
presently
by
the
smoother
water
he
knew
he
must
be
in
the
lea
of
little
bear
the
cries
sounded
nearer
he
must
already
have
rowed
nearly
a
mile
the
next
minute
he
shot
around
a
small
headland
and
right
before
him
dimly
visible
in
the
faint
light
cast
by
the
lantern
through
the
fog
was
an
upturned
boat
with
two
men
clinging
to
it
one
on
each
side
evidently
almost
exhausted
natty
rowed
cautiously
up
to
the
one
nearest
him
knowing
that
he
must
be
wary
lest
the
grip
of
the
drowning
man
overturn
his
own
light
skiff
let
go
when
i
say
he
shouted
and
do
grab
anything
do
you
hear
do
grab
now
let
go
the
next
minute
the
man
lay
in
the
dory
dragged
over
the
stern
by
netty
grip
on
his
collar
lie
still
ordered
natty
clutching
the
oars
to
row
around
the
overturned
boat
amid
the
swirl
of
water
about
her
was
a
task
that
taxed
netty
skill
and
strength
to
the
utmost
the
other
man
was
dragged
in
over
the
bow
and
with
a
gasp
of
relief
natty
pulled
away
from
the
sinking
boat
once
clear
of
her
he
could
not
row
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
with
the
reaction
from
tremendous
effort
and
strain
this
never
do
he
muttered
i
not
going
to
be
a
baby
now
but
will
i
ever
be
able
to
row
back
presently
however
he
was
able
to
grip
his
oars
again
and
pull
for
the
lighthouse
whose
beacon
loomed
dimly
through
the
fog
like
a
great
blur
of
whiter
mist
the
men
obedient
to
his
orders
lay
quietly
where
he
had
placed
them
and
before
long
natty
was
back
again
at
the
lighthouse
landing
where
prue
was
waiting
wild
with
anxiety
the
men
were
helped
out
and
assisted
up
to
the
lighthouse
where
natty
went
to
hunt
up
dry
clothes
for
them
and
prue
flew
about
to
prepare
hot
drinks
to
think
that
that
child
saved
us
exclaimed
one
of
the
men
why
i
did
think
a
grown
man
had
the
strength
to
do
what
he
did
he
is
your
brother
i
suppose
miss
miller
you
have
another
brother
i
think
oh
yes
everett
but
he
is
away
explained
prue
we
heard
your
shouts
and
natty
insisted
on
going
at
once
to
your
rescue
well
he
came
just
in
time
i
could
have
held
on
another
minute
was
so
done
up
i
could
have
moved
or
spoken
all
the
way
here
even
if
he
had
commanded
me
to
keep
perfectly
still
natty
returned
at
this
moment
and
exclaimed
why
it
is
barr
i
did
recognize
you
before
barr
it
is
young
man
this
gentleman
is
my
friend
blackmore
we
have
been
celebrating
victoria
day
by
a
shooting
tramp
over
little
bear
we
hired
a
boat
from
ford
at
the
harbour
head
this
morning
the
he
called
her
and
sailed
over
i
do
know
much
about
running
a
boat
but
blackmore
here
thinks
he
does
we
were
at
the
other
side
of
the
island
when
the
fog
came
up
we
hurried
across
it
but
it
was
almost
dark
when
we
reached
our
boat
we
sailed
around
the
point
and
then
the
boat
just
simply
upset
do
know
why
but
i
know
why
interrupted
natty
indignantly
that
does
nothing
but
upset
she
has
turned
turtle
twice
out
in
the
harbour
in
fine
weather
ford
was
a
rascal
to
let
her
to
you
he
might
have
known
what
would
happen
why
why
it
was
almost
murder
to
let
you
go
i
thought
there
must
be
something
queer
about
her
declared
blackmore
i
do
know
how
to
handle
a
boat
despite
my
friend
gibe
and
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
have
upset
like
that
that
ford
ought
to
be
horsewhipped
thanks
to
prue
stinging
hot
decoctions
of
black
currant
drink
the
two
gentlemen
were
no
worse
for
their
drenching
and
exposure
and
the
next
morning
natty
took
them
to
the
mainland
in
the
when
he
parted
with
them
barr
shook
his
hand
heartily
and
said
thank
you
my
boy
you
a
plucky
youngster
and
a
skilful
one
too
tell
your
brother
that
if
i
can
get
the
blue
point
lighthouse
berth
for
him
i
will
and
as
for
yourself
you
will
always
find
a
friend
in
me
and
if
i
can
ever
do
anything
for
you
i
will
two
weeks
later
everett
received
an
official
document
formally
appointing
him
keeper
of
blue
point
island
light
natty
carried
the
news
to
the
mainland
where
it
was
joyfully
received
among
the
fishermen
only
right
and
fair
said
cooper
creasy
blue
point
without
a
miller
to
light
up
would
seem
the
thing
at
all
that
what
and
it
nothing
but
ev
doo
guess
natty
had
more
to
do
with
it
than
ev
said
adam
perpetrating
a
very
poor
pun
and
being
immensely
applauded
therefor
it
keyed
will
scott
up
to
rival
adam
you
said
that
irving
had
a
pull
and
the
millers
had
he
said
jocularly
but
it
looks
as
if
was
natty
pull
did
the
business
after
all
his
pull
over
to
bear
island
and
back
it
was
about
a
miracle
that
a
boy
could
do
what
he
did
on
such
a
night
said
charles
macey
where
ford
asked
natty
uncomfortably
he
hated
to
have
his
exploit
talked
about
ford
has
cleared
out
said
cooper
gone
down
to
summerside
to
go
into
tobe
meekins
factory
there
best
thing
he
could
do
what
folks
here
had
no
use
for
him
after
letting
that
death
trap
to
them
two
men
even
if
they
was
the
druv
ashore
on
little
bear
and
there
she
going
to
remain
i
guess
d
want
a
berth
in
my
mackerel
boat
this
summer
natty
i
do
said
natty
but
i
thought
you
said
you
were
full
i
guess
i
can
make
room
for
you
said
cooper
a
boy
with
such
grit
and
muscle
ai
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
seed
on
blue
point
what
yesser
we
make
room
for
you
and
natty
cup
of
happiness
was
full
penelope
party
waist
it
perfectly
horrid
to
be
so
poor
grumbled
penelope
penelope
did
not
often
grumble
but
just
now
as
she
sat
tapping
with
one
finger
her
invitation
to
blanche
anderson
party
she
felt
that
grumbling
was
the
only
relief
she
had
penelope
was
seventeen
and
when
one
is
seventeen
and
can
not
go
to
a
party
because
one
has
a
suitable
dress
to
wear
the
world
is
very
apt
to
seem
a
howling
wilderness
i
wish
i
could
think
of
some
way
to
get
you
a
new
waist
said
doris
with
what
these
sisters
called
the
poverty
pucker
coming
in
the
centre
of
her
pretty
forehead
if
your
black
skirt
were
sponged
and
pressed
and
it
would
do
very
well
penelope
saw
the
poverty
pucker
and
immediately
repented
with
all
her
impetuous
heart
having
grumbled
that
pucker
came
often
enough
without
being
brought
there
by
extra
worries
well
there
is
no
use
sitting
here
sighing
for
the
unattainable
she
said
jumping
up
briskly
i
better
be
putting
my
grey
matter
into
that
algebra
instead
of
wasting
it
plotting
for
a
party
dress
that
i
certainly
ca
get
it
a
sad
thing
for
a
body
to
lack
brains
when
she
wants
to
be
a
teacher
is
it
if
i
could
only
absorb
algebra
and
history
as
i
can
music
what
a
blessing
it
would
be
come
now
dorrie
dear
smooth
that
pucker
out
next
year
i
shall
be
earning
a
princely
salary
which
we
can
squander
on
party
gowns
at
will
if
people
have
given
up
inviting
us
by
that
time
in
sheer
despair
of
ever
being
able
to
conquer
our
exclusiveness
penelope
went
off
to
her
detested
algebra
with
a
laugh
but
the
pucker
did
not
go
out
of
doris
forehead
she
wanted
penelope
to
go
to
that
party
penelope
has
studied
so
hard
all
winter
and
she
has
gone
anywhere
thought
the
older
sister
wistfully
she
is
getting
discouraged
over
those
examinations
and
she
needs
just
a
good
jolly
time
to
hearten
her
up
if
it
could
only
be
managed
but
doris
did
not
see
how
it
could
it
took
every
cent
of
her
small
salary
as
typewriter
in
an
uptown
office
to
run
their
tiny
establishment
and
keep
penelope
in
school
dresses
and
books
indeed
she
could
not
have
done
even
that
much
if
they
had
not
owned
their
little
cottage
next
year
it
would
be
easier
if
penelope
got
through
her
examinations
successfully
but
just
now
there
was
absolutely
not
a
spare
penny
it
is
hard
to
be
poor
we
are
a
pair
of
misfits
said
doris
with
a
patient
little
smile
thinking
of
penelope
uncultivated
talent
for
music
and
her
own
housewifely
gifts
which
had
small
chance
of
flowering
out
in
her
business
life
doris
dreamed
of
pretty
dresses
all
that
night
and
thought
about
them
all
the
next
day
so
it
must
be
confessed
did
penelope
though
she
would
not
have
admitted
it
for
the
world
when
doris
reached
home
the
next
evening
she
found
penelope
hovering
over
a
bulky
parcel
on
the
table
i
so
glad
you
come
she
said
with
an
exaggerated
gasp
of
relief
i
really
do
think
my
curiosity
could
have
borne
the
strain
for
another
five
minutes
the
expressman
brought
this
parcel
an
hour
ago
and
there
a
letter
for
you
from
aunt
adella
on
the
clock
shelf
and
i
think
they
belong
to
each
other
hurry
up
and
find
out
dorrie
darling
what
if
it
should
be
a
a
present
of
some
sort
or
other
i
suppose
it
ca
be
anything
else
smiled
doris
she
knew
that
penelope
had
started
out
to
say
a
new
dress
she
cut
the
strings
and
removed
the
wrappings
both
girls
stared
is
it
it
is
yes
it
is
doris
hunter
i
believe
it
an
old
quilt
doris
unfolded
the
odd
present
with
a
queer
feeling
of
disappointment
she
did
not
know
just
what
she
had
expected
the
package
to
contain
but
certainly
not
this
she
laughed
a
little
shakily
well
we
ca
say
after
this
that
aunt
adella
never
gave
us
anything
she
said
when
she
had
opened
her
letter
listen
penelope
dear
have
decided
to
give
up
housekeeping
and
go
out
west
to
live
with
robert
so
i
am
disposing
of
such
of
the
family
heirlooms
as
i
do
not
wish
to
take
with
me
i
am
sending
you
by
express
your
grandmother
hunter
silk
quilt
it
is
a
handsome
article
still
and
i
hope
you
will
prize
it
as
you
should
it
took
your
grandmother
five
years
to
make
it
there
is
a
bit
of
the
wedding
dress
of
every
member
of
the
family
in
it
love
to
penelope
and
affectionate
aunt
adella
i
do
see
its
beauty
said
penelope
with
a
grimace
it
may
have
been
pretty
once
but
it
is
all
faded
now
it
is
a
monument
of
patience
though
the
pattern
is
what
they
call
thousands
is
it
tell
me
dorrie
does
it
argue
a
lack
of
proper
respect
for
my
ancestors
that
i
ca
feel
very
enthusiastic
over
this
heirloom
especially
when
grandmother
hunter
died
years
before
i
was
born
it
was
very
kind
of
aunt
adella
to
send
it
said
doris
dutifully
oh
very
agreed
penelope
drolly
only
do
ever
ask
me
to
sleep
under
it
it
would
give
me
the
nightmare
this
last
was
a
little
squeal
of
admiration
as
doris
turned
the
quilt
over
and
brought
to
view
the
shimmering
lining
why
the
wrong
side
is
ever
so
much
prettier
than
the
right
exclaimed
penelope
what
lovely
stuff
and
not
a
bit
faded
the
lining
was
certainly
very
pretty
it
was
a
soft
creamy
yellow
silk
with
a
design
of
brocaded
pink
rosebuds
all
over
it
that
was
a
dress
grandmother
hunter
had
when
she
was
a
girl
said
doris
absently
i
remember
hearing
aunt
adella
speak
of
it
when
it
became
grandmother
used
it
to
line
her
quilt
i
declare
it
is
as
good
as
new
well
let
us
go
and
have
tea
said
penelope
i
decidedly
hungry
besides
i
see
the
poverty
pucker
coming
put
the
quilt
in
the
spare
room
it
is
something
to
possess
an
heirloom
after
all
it
gives
one
a
nice
feeling
after
tea
when
penelope
was
patiently
grinding
away
at
her
studies
and
thinking
dolefully
enough
of
the
examinations
which
she
dreaded
and
of
teaching
which
she
confidently
expected
to
hate
doris
went
up
to
the
tiny
spare
room
to
look
at
the
wrong
side
of
the
quilt
again
it
would
make
the
loveliest
party
waist
she
said
under
her
breath
creamy
yellow
is
penelope
colour
and
i
could
use
that
bit
of
old
black
lace
and
those
knots
of
velvet
ribbon
that
i
have
to
trim
it
i
wonder
if
grandmother
hunter
reproachful
spirit
will
forever
haunt
me
if
i
do
it
doris
knew
very
well
that
she
would
do
it
had
known
it
ever
since
she
had
looked
at
that
lovely
lining
and
a
vision
of
penelope
vivid
face
and
hair
rising
above
a
waist
of
the
quaint
old
silk
had
flashed
before
her
mental
sight
that
night
after
penelope
had
gone
to
bed
doris
ripped
the
lining
out
of
grandmother
hunter
silk
quilt
if
aunt
adella
saw
me
now
she
laughed
softly
to
herself
as
she
worked
in
the
three
following
evenings
doris
made
the
waist
she
thought
it
a
wonderful
bit
of
good
luck
that
penelope
went
out
each
of
the
evenings
to
study
some
especially
difficult
problems
with
a
school
chum
it
will
be
such
a
nice
surprise
for
her
the
sister
mused
jubilantly
penelope
was
surprised
as
much
as
the
tender
sisterly
heart
could
wish
when
doris
flashed
out
upon
her
triumphantly
on
the
evening
of
the
party
with
the
black
skirt
nicely
pressed
and
and
the
prettiest
waist
imaginable
a
waist
that
was
a
positive
creation
of
dainty
silk
with
a
girdle
and
knots
of
black
velvet
doris
hunter
you
are
a
veritable
little
witch
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
conjured
that
perfectly
lovely
thing
for
me
out
of
the
lining
of
grandmother
hunter
quilt
so
penelope
went
to
blanche
party
and
her
dress
was
the
admiration
of
every
girl
there
fairweather
who
was
visiting
anderson
looked
closely
at
it
also
she
was
a
very
sweet
old
lady
with
silver
hair
which
she
wore
in
delightful
puffs
and
she
had
very
bright
dark
eyes
penelope
thought
her
altogether
charming
she
looks
as
if
she
had
just
stepped
out
of
the
frame
of
some
lovely
old
picture
she
said
to
herself
i
wish
she
belonged
to
me
just
love
to
have
a
grandmother
like
her
and
i
do
wonder
who
it
is
i
seen
who
looks
so
much
like
her
a
little
later
on
the
knowledge
came
to
her
suddenly
and
she
thought
with
inward
surprise
why
it
is
doris
of
course
if
my
sister
doris
lives
to
be
seventy
years
old
and
wears
her
hair
in
pretty
white
puffs
she
will
look
exactly
as
fairweather
does
now
fairweather
asked
to
have
penelope
introduced
to
her
and
when
they
found
themselves
alone
together
she
said
gently
my
dear
i
am
going
to
ask
a
very
impertinent
question
will
you
tell
me
where
you
got
the
silk
of
which
your
waist
is
made
poor
penelope
pretty
young
face
turned
crimson
she
was
not
troubled
with
false
pride
by
any
means
but
she
simply
could
not
bring
herself
to
tell
fairweather
that
her
waist
was
made
out
of
the
lining
of
an
old
heirloom
quilt
my
aunt
adella
gave
me
gave
us
the
material
she
stammered
and
my
elder
sister
doris
made
the
waist
for
me
i
think
the
silk
once
belonged
to
my
grandmother
hunter
what
was
your
grandmother
maiden
name
asked
fairweather
eagerly
penelope
saverne
i
am
named
after
her
fairweather
suddenly
put
her
arm
about
penelope
and
drew
the
young
girl
to
her
her
lovely
old
face
aglow
with
delight
and
tenderness
then
you
are
my
grandniece
she
said
your
grandmother
was
my
when
i
saw
your
dress
i
felt
sure
you
were
related
to
her
i
should
recognize
that
rosebud
silk
if
i
came
across
it
in
thibet
penelope
saverne
was
the
daughter
of
my
mother
by
her
first
husband
penelope
was
four
years
older
than
i
was
but
we
were
devoted
to
each
other
oddly
enough
our
birthdays
fell
on
the
same
day
and
when
penelope
was
twenty
and
i
sixteen
my
father
gave
us
each
a
silk
dress
of
this
very
material
i
have
mine
yet
soon
after
this
our
mother
died
and
our
household
was
broken
up
penelope
went
to
live
with
her
aunt
and
i
went
west
with
father
this
was
long
ago
you
know
when
travelling
and
correspondence
were
not
the
easy
things
they
are
now
after
a
few
years
i
lost
touch
with
my
i
married
out
west
and
have
lived
there
all
my
life
i
never
knew
what
had
become
of
penelope
but
tonight
when
i
saw
you
come
in
in
that
waist
made
of
the
rosebud
silk
the
whole
past
rose
before
me
and
i
felt
like
a
girl
again
my
dear
i
am
a
very
lonely
old
woman
with
nobody
belonging
to
me
you
do
know
how
delighted
i
am
to
find
that
i
have
two
grandnieces
penelope
had
listened
silently
like
a
girl
in
a
dream
now
she
patted
fairweather
soft
old
hand
affectionately
it
sounds
like
a
storybook
she
said
gaily
you
must
come
and
see
doris
she
is
such
a
darling
sister
i
would
have
had
this
waist
if
it
had
been
for
her
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
do
mind
it
now
doris
made
my
party
waist
for
me
out
of
the
lining
of
an
old
silk
quilt
of
grandmother
hunter
that
aunt
adella
sent
us
fairweather
did
go
to
see
doris
the
very
next
day
and
quite
wonderful
things
came
to
pass
from
that
interview
doris
and
penelope
found
their
lives
and
plans
changed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
they
were
both
to
go
and
live
with
aunt
esther
as
fairweather
had
said
they
must
call
her
penelope
was
to
have
at
last
her
musical
education
and
doris
was
to
be
the
home
girl
you
must
take
the
place
of
my
own
dear
little
granddaughter
said
aunt
esther
she
died
six
years
ago
and
i
have
been
so
lonely
since
when
fairweather
had
gone
doris
and
penelope
looked
at
each
other
pinch
me
please
said
penelope
i
half
afraid
i
wake
up
and
find
i
have
been
dreaming
is
it
all
wonderful
doris
hunter
doris
nodded
radiantly
oh
penelope
think
of
it
music
for
you
somebody
to
pet
and
fuss
over
for
me
and
such
a
dear
sweet
aunty
for
us
both
and
no
more
contriving
party
waists
out
of
old
silk
linings
laughed
penelope
but
it
was
very
fortunate
that
you
did
it
for
once
sister
mine
and
no
more
poverty
puckers
she
concluded
the
girl
and
the
wild
race
if
judith
would
only
get
married
theodora
whitney
was
wont
to
sigh
dolorously
now
there
was
no
valid
reason
why
judith
ought
to
get
married
unless
she
wanted
to
but
judith
was
and
theodora
thought
it
was
a
terrible
disgrace
to
be
an
old
maid
there
has
never
been
an
old
maid
in
our
family
so
far
back
as
we
know
of
she
lamented
and
to
think
that
there
should
be
one
now
it
just
drags
us
down
to
the
level
of
the
mcgregors
they
have
always
been
noted
for
their
old
maids
judith
took
all
her
aunt
lamentations
sometimes
she
argued
the
subject
placidly
why
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
rid
of
me
aunt
theo
i
sure
we
very
comfortable
here
together
and
you
know
you
would
miss
me
terribly
if
i
went
away
if
you
took
the
right
one
you
would
go
so
very
far
said
theodora
darkly
significant
and
anyhow
i
put
up
with
any
amount
of
lonesomeness
rather
than
have
an
old
maid
in
the
family
it
all
very
fine
now
when
you
still
young
enough
and
good
looking
with
lots
of
beaus
at
your
beck
and
call
but
that
wo
last
much
longer
and
if
you
go
on
with
your
you
wake
up
some
fine
day
to
find
that
your
time
for
choosing
has
gone
by
your
mother
used
to
be
dreadful
proud
of
your
good
looks
when
you
was
a
baby
i
told
her
she
need
be
nine
times
out
of
ten
a
beauty
do
marry
as
well
as
an
ordinary
girl
i
not
much
set
on
marrying
at
all
declared
judith
sharply
any
reference
to
the
right
one
always
disturbed
her
placidity
the
real
root
of
the
trouble
was
that
theodora
right
one
and
right
one
were
two
different
people
the
ramble
valley
young
men
were
very
fond
of
dancing
attendance
on
judith
even
if
she
were
verging
on
old
maidenhood
her
prettiness
was
undeniable
the
stewarts
came
to
maturity
late
and
at
judith
dower
of
flesh
dimpled
red
lips
and
shining
bronze
hair
was
at
its
fullest
splendor
besides
she
was
jolly
and
jollity
went
a
long
way
in
ramble
valley
popularity
of
all
judith
admirers
eben
king
alone
found
favor
in
theodora
eyes
he
owned
the
adjoining
farm
was
well
off
and
homely
so
homely
that
judith
declared
it
made
her
eyes
ache
to
look
at
him
bruce
marshall
judith
right
one
was
handsome
but
theodora
looked
upon
him
with
sour
disapproval
he
owned
a
stony
little
farm
at
the
remote
end
of
ramble
valley
and
was
reputed
to
be
fonder
of
many
things
than
of
work
to
be
sure
judith
had
enough
capability
and
energy
for
two
but
theodora
detested
a
lazy
man
she
ordered
judith
not
to
encourage
him
and
judith
obeyed
judith
generally
obeyed
her
aunt
but
though
she
renounced
bruce
marshall
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
eben
king
or
anybody
else
and
all
grumblings
did
not
mend
matters
the
afternoon
that
tony
mack
came
in
theodora
felt
more
aggrieved
than
ever
ellie
mcgregor
had
been
married
the
previous
week
ellie
who
was
the
same
age
as
judith
and
not
half
so
good
looking
theodora
had
been
nagging
judith
ever
since
but
i
might
as
well
talk
to
the
trees
down
there
in
that
hollow
she
complained
to
tony
that
girl
is
so
set
and
contrary
minded
she
does
care
a
bit
for
my
feelings
this
was
not
said
behind
judith
back
the
girl
herself
was
standing
at
the
open
door
drinking
in
all
the
delicate
evasive
beauty
of
the
spring
afternoon
the
whitney
house
crested
a
bare
hill
that
looked
down
on
misty
intervals
feathered
with
young
firs
that
were
golden
green
in
the
pale
sunlight
the
fields
were
bare
and
smoking
although
the
lanes
and
shadowy
places
were
full
of
moist
snow
judith
face
was
aglow
with
the
delight
of
mere
life
and
she
bent
out
to
front
the
brisk
dancing
wind
that
blew
up
from
the
valley
resinous
with
the
odors
of
firs
and
damp
mosses
at
her
aunt
words
the
glow
went
out
of
her
face
she
listened
with
her
eyes
brooding
on
the
hollow
and
a
glowing
flame
of
temper
smouldering
in
them
judith
long
patience
was
giving
way
she
had
been
flicked
on
the
raw
too
often
of
late
and
now
her
aunt
was
confiding
her
grievances
to
tony
mack
the
most
notorious
gossip
in
ramble
valley
or
out
of
it
i
ca
sleep
at
nights
for
worrying
over
what
will
become
of
her
when
i
gone
went
on
theodora
dismally
she
just
have
to
live
on
alone
here
a
lonesome
old
maid
and
her
that
might
have
had
her
pick
tony
though
i
do
say
it
as
should
you
must
feel
real
thankful
to
have
all
your
girls
married
off
especially
when
none
of
them
was
extry
some
people
have
all
the
luck
i
tired
of
talking
to
judith
folks
be
saying
soon
that
nobody
ever
really
wanted
her
for
all
her
flirting
but
she
just
wo
marry
i
will
judith
whirled
about
on
the
sun
warm
door
step
and
came
in
her
black
eyes
were
flashing
and
her
round
cheeks
were
crimson
such
a
temper
you
never
saw
reported
tony
afterwards
though
to
be
wondered
at
theodora
was
most
awful
aggravating
i
will
repeated
judith
stormily
i
tired
of
being
nagged
day
in
and
day
out
i
marry
and
what
is
more
i
marry
the
very
first
man
that
asks
me
that
i
will
if
it
is
old
widower
delane
himself
how
does
that
suit
you
aunt
theodora
theodora
mental
processes
were
never
slow
she
dropped
her
knitting
ball
and
stooped
for
it
in
that
time
she
had
decided
what
to
do
she
knew
that
judith
would
stick
to
her
word
and
she
must
trim
her
sails
to
catch
this
new
wind
it
suits
me
real
well
judith
she
said
calmly
you
can
marry
the
first
man
that
asks
you
and
i
say
no
word
to
hinder
the
color
went
out
of
judith
face
leaving
it
pale
as
ashes
her
hasty
assertion
had
no
sooner
been
uttered
than
it
was
repented
of
but
she
must
stand
by
it
now
she
went
out
of
the
kitchen
without
another
glance
at
her
aunt
or
the
delighted
tony
and
dashed
up
the
stairs
to
her
own
little
room
which
looked
out
over
the
whole
of
ramble
valley
it
was
warm
with
the
march
sunshine
and
the
leafless
boughs
of
the
creeper
that
covered
the
end
of
the
house
were
tapping
a
gay
tattoo
on
the
window
panes
to
the
music
of
the
wind
judith
sat
down
in
her
little
rocker
and
dropped
her
pointed
chin
in
her
hands
far
down
the
valley
over
the
firs
on
the
mcgregor
hill
and
the
blue
mirror
of
the
cranston
pond
bruce
marshall
little
gray
house
peeped
out
from
a
semicircle
of
birches
she
had
not
seen
bruce
since
before
christmas
he
had
been
angry
at
her
then
because
she
had
refused
to
let
him
drive
her
home
from
prayer
meeting
since
then
she
had
heard
a
rumor
that
he
was
going
to
see
kitty
leigh
at
the
upper
valley
judith
looked
sombrely
down
at
the
marshall
homestead
she
had
always
loved
the
quaint
picturesque
old
place
so
different
from
all
the
commonplace
spick
and
span
new
houses
of
the
prosperous
valley
judith
had
never
been
able
to
decide
whether
she
really
cared
very
much
for
bruce
marshall
or
not
but
she
knew
that
she
loved
that
rambling
cornery
house
of
his
with
the
gable
festooned
with
the
real
ivy
that
bruce
marshall
had
brought
with
her
from
england
judith
thought
contrastingly
of
eben
king
staring
house
in
all
its
bare
intrusive
grandeur
she
gave
a
little
shrug
of
distaste
i
wish
bruce
knew
of
this
she
thought
flushing
even
in
her
solitude
at
the
idea
although
if
it
is
true
that
he
is
going
to
see
kitty
leigh
i
do
suppose
he
care
and
aunt
theo
will
be
sure
to
send
word
to
eben
by
hook
or
crook
whatever
possessed
me
to
say
such
a
mad
thing
there
goes
tony
now
all
agog
to
spread
such
a
delectable
bit
of
gossip
tony
had
indeed
gone
refusing
theodora
invitation
to
stay
to
tea
so
eager
was
she
to
tell
her
story
and
theodora
at
that
very
minute
was
out
in
her
kitchen
yard
giving
her
instructions
to
potter
vane
the
twelve
year
old
urchin
who
cut
her
wood
and
did
sundry
other
chores
for
her
potter
she
said
excitedly
run
over
to
the
kings
and
tell
eben
to
come
over
here
immediately
no
matter
what
he
at
tell
him
i
want
to
see
him
about
something
of
the
greatest
importance
theodora
thought
that
this
was
a
master
stroke
that
match
is
as
good
as
made
she
thought
triumphantly
as
she
picked
up
chips
to
start
the
tea
fire
if
judith
suspects
that
eben
is
here
she
is
quite
likely
to
stay
in
her
room
and
refuse
to
come
down
but
if
she
does
i
march
him
upstairs
to
her
door
and
make
him
ask
her
through
the
keyhole
you
ca
stump
theodora
whitney
alas
ten
minutes
later
potter
returned
with
the
unwelcome
news
that
eben
was
away
from
home
he
went
to
wexbridge
about
half
an
hour
ago
his
ma
said
she
said
she
tell
him
to
come
right
over
as
soon
as
he
kem
home
theodora
had
to
content
herself
with
this
but
she
felt
troubled
she
knew
tony
mack
capabilities
for
spreading
news
what
if
bruce
marshall
should
hear
it
before
eben
that
evening
jacob
plowden
store
at
wexbridge
was
full
of
men
sitting
about
on
kegs
and
counters
or
huddling
around
the
stove
for
the
march
air
had
grown
sharp
as
the
sun
lowered
in
the
creamy
sky
over
the
ramble
valley
hills
eben
king
had
a
keg
in
the
corner
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
go
home
for
he
loved
gossip
dearly
and
the
wexbridge
stores
abounded
with
it
he
had
exhausted
the
news
of
peter
stanley
store
across
the
bridge
and
now
he
meant
to
hear
what
was
saying
at
plowden
bruce
marshall
was
there
too
buying
groceries
and
being
waited
on
by
nora
plowden
who
was
by
no
means
averse
to
the
service
although
as
a
rule
her
father
customers
received
scanty
tolerance
at
her
hands
what
are
the
valley
roads
like
marshall
asked
a
wexbridge
man
between
two
squirts
of
tobacco
juice
bad
said
bruce
briefly
another
warm
day
will
finish
the
sleighing
are
they
crossing
at
malley
creek
yet
asked
plowden
no
jack
carr
got
in
there
day
before
yesterday
nearly
lost
his
mare
i
came
round
by
the
main
road
responded
bruce
the
door
opened
at
this
point
and
tony
mack
came
in
as
soon
as
he
closed
the
door
he
doubled
up
in
a
fit
of
chuckles
which
lasted
until
he
was
purple
in
the
face
is
the
man
crazy
demanded
plowden
who
had
never
seen
lean
little
tony
visited
like
this
before
crazy
nothin
retorted
tony
you
laugh
too
when
you
hear
it
such
a
joke
theodora
whitney
has
been
badgering
judith
stewart
so
much
about
bein
an
old
maid
that
judith
got
mad
and
vowed
she
marry
the
first
man
that
asks
her
my
old
woman
was
there
and
heard
her
keep
her
word
too
she
ai
old
joshua
stewart
daughter
for
nothin
if
he
said
he
do
a
thing
he
did
it
if
it
tuck
the
hair
off
if
i
was
a
young
feller
now
bruce
marshall
swung
round
on
one
foot
his
face
was
crimson
and
if
looks
could
kill
tony
mack
would
have
fallen
dead
in
the
middle
of
his
sniggers
you
need
mind
doing
up
that
parcel
for
me
he
said
to
nora
not
wait
for
it
on
his
way
to
the
door
eben
king
brushed
past
him
a
shout
of
laughter
from
the
assembled
men
followed
them
the
others
streamed
out
in
their
wake
realizing
that
a
race
was
afoot
tony
alone
remained
inside
helpless
with
chuckling
eben
king
horse
was
tied
at
the
door
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
step
in
and
drive
off
bruce
had
put
his
mare
in
at
billy
bender
across
the
bridge
intending
to
spend
the
evening
there
he
knew
that
this
would
handicap
him
seriously
but
he
strode
down
the
road
with
a
determined
expression
on
his
handsome
face
fifteen
minutes
later
he
drove
past
the
store
his
gray
mare
going
at
a
sharp
gait
the
crowd
in
front
of
plowden
cheered
him
their
sympathies
were
with
him
for
king
was
not
popular
tony
had
come
out
and
shouted
here
luck
to
you
brother
after
which
he
doubled
up
with
renewed
laughter
such
a
lark
and
he
tony
had
set
it
afoot
it
would
be
a
story
to
tell
for
years
marshall
with
his
lips
set
and
his
dreamy
gray
eyes
for
once
glittering
with
a
steely
light
urged
lady
jane
up
the
wexbridge
hill
from
its
top
it
was
five
miles
to
ramble
valley
by
the
main
road
a
full
mile
ahead
of
him
he
saw
eben
king
getting
along
through
mud
and
slush
and
occasional
big
slumpy
drifts
of
old
snow
as
fast
as
his
trotter
could
carry
him
as
a
rule
eben
was
exceedingly
careful
of
his
horses
but
now
he
was
sending
bay
billy
along
for
all
that
was
in
him
for
a
second
bruce
hesitated
then
he
turned
his
mare
down
the
field
cut
to
malley
creek
it
was
taking
lady
jane
life
and
possibly
his
own
in
his
hand
but
it
was
his
only
chance
he
could
never
have
overtaken
bay
billy
on
the
main
road
do
your
best
lady
jane
he
muttered
and
lady
jane
plunged
down
the
steep
hillside
through
the
glutinous
mud
of
a
ploughed
field
as
if
she
meant
to
do
it
beyond
the
field
was
a
ravine
full
of
firs
through
which
creek
ran
to
cross
it
meant
a
cut
to
ramble
valley
the
ice
looked
black
and
rotten
to
the
left
was
the
ragged
hole
where
jack
carr
mare
had
struggled
for
her
life
bruce
headed
lady
jane
higher
up
if
a
crossing
could
be
made
at
all
it
was
only
between
and
the
old
ice
road
lady
jane
swerved
at
the
bank
and
whickered
on
old
girl
said
bruce
in
a
tense
voice
unwillingly
she
advanced
picking
her
steps
with
sagacity
once
her
foot
went
through
bruce
pulled
her
up
with
hands
that
did
not
tremble
the
next
moment
she
was
scrambling
up
the
opposite
bank
glancing
back
bruce
saw
the
ice
parting
in
her
footprints
and
the
black
water
gurgling
up
but
the
race
was
not
yet
decided
by
crossing
the
creek
he
had
won
no
more
than
an
equal
chance
with
eben
king
and
the
field
road
before
him
was
much
worse
than
the
main
road
there
was
little
snow
on
it
and
some
bad
sloughs
but
lady
jane
was
good
for
it
for
once
she
should
not
be
spared
just
as
the
red
ball
of
the
sun
touched
the
wooded
hills
of
the
valley
theodora
looking
from
the
cowstable
door
saw
two
sleighs
approaching
the
horses
of
which
were
going
at
a
gallop
one
was
trundling
down
the
main
road
headlong
through
old
drifts
and
slumpy
snow
where
a
false
step
might
send
the
horse
floundering
to
the
bottom
the
other
was
coming
up
from
the
direction
of
the
creek
full
tilt
through
tony
mack
stump
land
where
not
a
vestige
of
snow
coated
the
huge
roots
over
which
the
runners
bumped
for
a
moment
theodora
stood
at
a
gaze
then
she
recognized
both
drivers
she
dropped
her
milking
pail
and
ran
to
the
house
thinking
as
she
ran
she
knew
that
judith
was
alone
in
the
kitchen
if
eben
king
got
there
first
well
and
good
but
if
bruce
marshall
won
the
race
he
must
encounter
her
theodora
he
wo
propose
to
judith
as
long
as
i
round
she
panted
i
know
him
he
too
shy
but
eben
wo
mind
i
tip
him
the
wink
potter
vane
was
chopping
wood
before
the
door
theodora
recognizing
in
him
a
further
obstacle
to
marshall
wooing
caught
him
unceremoniously
by
the
arm
and
hauled
him
axe
and
all
over
the
doorstone
and
into
the
kitchen
just
as
bruce
marshall
and
eben
king
drove
into
the
yard
with
not
a
second
to
spare
between
them
there
was
a
woeful
cut
on
bay
billy
slender
foreleg
and
the
reeking
lady
jane
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
the
staunch
little
mare
had
brought
her
master
over
that
stretch
of
sticky
field
road
in
time
but
she
was
almost
exhausted
both
men
sprang
from
their
sleighs
and
ran
to
the
door
bruce
marshall
won
it
by
and
burst
into
the
kitchen
with
his
rival
hot
on
his
heels
theodora
stood
defiantly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
still
grasping
the
dazed
and
dismayed
potter
in
a
corner
judith
turned
from
the
window
whence
she
had
been
watching
the
finish
of
the
race
she
was
pale
and
tense
from
excitement
in
those
few
gasping
moments
she
had
looked
on
her
heart
as
on
an
open
book
she
knew
at
last
that
she
loved
bruce
marshall
and
her
eyes
met
his
fiery
gray
ones
as
he
sprang
over
the
threshold
judith
will
you
marry
me
gasped
bruce
before
eben
who
had
first
looked
at
theodora
and
the
squirming
potter
had
located
the
girl
yes
said
judith
she
burst
into
hysterical
tears
as
she
said
it
and
sat
limply
down
in
a
chair
theodora
loosed
her
grip
on
potter
you
can
go
back
to
your
work
she
said
dully
she
followed
him
out
and
eben
king
followed
her
on
the
step
she
reached
behind
him
and
closed
the
door
trust
a
king
for
being
too
late
she
said
bitterly
and
unjustly
eben
went
home
with
bay
billy
potter
gazed
after
him
until
theodora
ordered
him
to
put
marshall
mare
in
the
stable
and
rub
her
down
anyway
judith
wo
be
an
old
maid
she
comforted
herself
the
promise
of
lucy
ellen
cecily
foster
came
down
the
sloping
road
from
the
village
at
a
leisurely
pace
usually
she
walked
with
a
long
determined
stride
but
the
drowsy
mellowing
influence
of
the
autumn
afternoon
was
strong
upon
her
and
filled
her
with
placid
content
without
being
actively
conscious
of
it
she
was
satisfied
with
the
existing
circumstances
of
her
life
it
was
half
over
now
the
half
of
it
yet
to
be
lived
stretched
before
her
tranquil
pleasant
and
uneventful
like
the
afternoon
filled
with
unhurried
duties
and
calmly
interesting
days
cecily
liked
the
prospect
when
she
came
to
her
own
lane
she
paused
folding
her
hands
on
the
top
of
the
whitewashed
gate
while
she
basked
for
a
moment
in
the
warmth
that
seemed
cupped
in
the
little
grassy
hollow
hedged
about
with
young
before
her
lay
sere
brooding
fields
sloping
down
to
a
sandy
shore
where
long
foamy
ripples
were
lapping
with
a
murmur
that
threaded
the
hushed
air
like
a
faint
minor
melody
on
the
crest
of
the
little
hill
to
her
right
was
her
home
hers
and
lucy
ellen
the
house
was
an
one
low
in
the
eaves
with
gables
and
porches
overgrown
with
vines
that
had
turned
to
and
rich
bronzes
in
the
october
frosts
on
three
sides
it
was
closed
in
by
tall
old
spruces
their
outer
sides
bared
and
grim
from
long
wrestling
with
the
atlantic
winds
but
their
inner
green
and
feathery
on
the
fourth
side
a
trim
white
paling
shut
in
the
flower
garden
before
the
front
door
cecily
could
see
the
beds
of
purple
and
scarlet
asters
making
rich
whorls
of
color
under
the
parlor
and
windows
lucy
ellen
bed
was
gayer
and
larger
than
cecily
lucy
ellen
had
always
had
better
luck
with
flowers
she
could
see
old
boxer
asleep
on
the
front
porch
step
and
lucy
ellen
white
cat
stretched
out
on
the
parlor
there
was
no
other
sign
of
life
about
the
place
cecily
drew
a
long
leisurely
breath
of
satisfaction
after
tea
i
dig
up
those
dahlia
roots
she
said
aloud
ought
to
be
up
my
how
blue
and
soft
that
sea
is
i
never
saw
such
a
lovely
day
i
been
gone
longer
than
i
expected
i
wonder
if
lucy
ellen
been
lonesome
when
cecily
looked
back
from
the
misty
ocean
to
the
house
she
was
surprised
to
see
a
man
coming
with
a
jaunty
step
down
the
lane
under
the
gnarled
spruces
she
looked
at
him
perplexedly
he
must
be
a
stranger
for
she
was
sure
no
man
in
oriental
walked
like
that
some
agent
has
been
pestering
lucy
ellen
i
suppose
she
muttered
vexedly
the
stranger
came
on
with
an
airy
briskness
utterly
foreign
to
orientalites
cecily
opened
the
gate
and
went
through
they
met
under
the
sugar
maple
in
the
heart
of
the
hollow
as
he
passed
the
man
lifted
his
hat
and
bowed
with
an
ingratiating
smile
he
was
about
well
although
somewhat
loudly
dressed
and
with
an
air
of
prosperity
pervading
his
whole
personality
he
had
a
heavy
gold
watch
chain
and
a
large
seal
ring
on
the
hand
that
lifted
his
hat
he
was
bald
with
a
high
shaksperian
forehead
and
a
halo
of
sandy
curls
his
face
was
ruddy
and
weak
but
his
eyes
were
large
and
blue
and
he
had
a
little
moustache
with
a
juvenile
twist
and
curl
in
it
cecily
did
not
recognize
him
yet
there
was
something
vaguely
familiar
about
him
she
walked
rapidly
up
to
the
house
in
the
she
found
lucy
ellen
peering
out
between
the
muslin
window
curtains
when
the
latter
turned
there
was
an
air
of
repressed
excitement
about
her
who
was
that
man
lucy
ellen
cecily
asked
to
cecily
amazement
lucy
ellen
blushed
a
warm
flood
of
color
that
rolled
over
her
delicate
little
face
like
a
miracle
of
rejuvenescence
did
you
know
him
that
was
cromwell
biron
she
simpered
although
lucy
ellen
was
forty
and
in
most
respects
sensible
she
could
not
help
simpering
upon
occasion
cromwell
biron
repeated
cecily
in
an
emotionless
voice
she
took
off
her
bonnet
mechanically
brushed
the
dust
from
its
ribbons
and
bows
and
went
to
put
it
carefully
away
in
its
white
box
in
the
spare
bedroom
she
felt
as
if
she
had
had
a
severe
shock
and
she
dared
not
ask
anything
more
just
then
lucy
ellen
blush
had
frightened
her
it
seemed
to
open
up
dizzying
possibilities
of
change
but
she
promised
she
promised
said
cecily
fiercely
under
her
breath
while
cecily
was
changing
her
dress
lucy
ellen
was
getting
the
tea
ready
in
the
little
kitchen
now
and
then
she
broke
out
into
singing
but
always
checked
herself
guiltily
cecily
heard
her
and
set
her
firm
mouth
a
little
firmer
if
a
man
had
jilted
me
twenty
years
ago
i
would
be
so
overwhelmingly
glad
to
see
him
when
he
came
back
especially
if
he
had
got
fat
and
she
added
her
face
involuntarily
twitching
into
a
smile
cecily
in
spite
of
her
serious
expression
and
intense
way
of
looking
at
life
had
an
irrepressible
sense
of
humor
tea
that
evening
was
not
the
pleasant
meal
it
usually
was
the
two
women
were
wont
to
talk
animatedly
to
each
other
and
cecily
had
many
things
to
tell
lucy
ellen
she
did
not
tell
them
neither
did
lucy
ellen
ask
any
questions
her
excitement
hanging
around
her
like
a
festal
garment
cecily
heart
was
on
fire
with
alarm
and
jealousy
she
smiled
a
little
cruelly
as
she
buttered
and
ate
her
toast
and
so
that
was
cromwell
biron
she
said
with
studied
carelessness
i
thought
there
was
something
familiar
about
him
when
did
he
come
home
he
got
to
oriental
yesterday
fluttered
back
lucy
ellen
he
going
to
be
home
for
two
months
we
we
had
such
an
interesting
talk
this
afternoon
he
he
as
full
of
jokes
as
ever
i
wished
you
been
here
this
was
a
fib
cecily
knew
it
i
do
then
she
said
contemptuously
you
know
i
never
had
much
use
for
cromwell
biron
i
think
he
had
a
face
of
his
own
to
come
down
here
to
see
you
uninvited
after
the
way
he
treated
you
lucy
ellen
blushed
scorchingly
and
was
miserably
silent
he
changed
terrible
in
his
looks
went
on
cecily
relentlessly
how
bald
he
got
and
fat
to
think
of
the
spruce
cromwell
biron
got
to
be
bald
and
fat
to
be
sure
he
still
has
the
same
sheepish
expression
will
you
pass
me
the
currant
jell
lucy
ellen
i
do
think
he
so
very
fat
she
said
resentfully
when
cecily
had
left
the
table
and
i
do
care
if
he
is
twenty
years
before
this
biron
had
jilted
lucy
ellen
foster
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
in
oriental
then
but
the
new
school
teacher
over
at
the
crossways
was
prettier
with
a
dash
of
piquancy
which
lucy
ellen
lacked
into
the
bargain
cromwell
and
the
school
teacher
had
run
away
and
been
married
and
lucy
ellen
was
left
to
pick
up
the
tattered
shreds
of
her
poor
romance
as
best
she
could
she
never
had
another
lover
she
told
herself
that
she
would
always
be
faithful
to
the
one
love
of
her
life
this
sounded
romantic
and
she
found
a
certain
comfort
in
it
she
had
been
brought
up
by
her
uncle
and
aunt
when
they
died
she
and
her
cousin
cecily
foster
found
themselves
except
for
each
other
alone
in
the
world
cecily
loved
lucy
ellen
as
a
sister
but
she
believed
that
lucy
ellen
would
yet
marry
and
her
heart
sank
at
the
prospect
of
being
left
without
a
soul
to
love
and
care
for
it
was
lucy
ellen
that
had
first
proposed
their
mutual
promise
but
cecily
had
grasped
at
it
eagerly
the
two
women
verging
on
decisive
old
maidenhood
solemnly
promised
each
other
that
they
would
never
marry
and
would
always
live
together
from
that
time
cecily
mind
had
been
at
ease
in
her
eyes
a
promise
was
a
sacred
thing
the
next
evening
at
cromwell
biron
received
quite
an
ovation
from
old
friends
and
neighbors
cromwell
had
been
a
favorite
in
his
boyhood
he
had
now
the
additional
glamour
of
novelty
and
reputed
wealth
he
was
beaming
and
expansive
he
went
into
the
choir
to
help
sing
lucy
ellen
sat
beside
him
and
they
sang
from
the
same
book
two
red
spots
burned
on
her
thin
cheeks
and
she
had
a
cluster
of
lavender
chrysanthemums
pinned
on
her
jacket
she
looked
almost
girlish
and
cromwell
biron
gazed
at
her
with
sidelong
admiration
while
cecily
watched
them
both
fiercely
from
her
pew
she
knew
that
cromwell
biron
had
come
home
wooing
his
old
love
but
he
get
her
cecily
whispered
into
her
hymnbook
somehow
it
was
a
comfort
to
articulate
the
words
she
promised
on
the
church
steps
cromwell
offered
his
arm
to
lucy
ellen
with
a
flourish
she
took
it
shyly
and
they
started
down
the
road
in
the
crisp
autumn
moonlight
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years
cecily
walked
home
from
alone
she
went
and
flung
herself
on
her
bed
reckless
for
once
of
her
second
best
hat
and
gown
lucy
ellen
did
not
venture
to
ask
cromwell
in
she
was
too
much
in
awe
of
cecily
for
that
but
she
loitered
with
him
at
the
gate
until
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
hall
struck
eleven
then
cromwell
went
away
whistling
gaily
with
lucy
ellen
chrysanthemum
in
his
buttonhole
and
lucy
ellen
went
in
and
cried
half
the
night
but
cecily
did
not
cry
she
lay
savagely
awake
until
morning
cromwell
biron
is
courting
you
again
she
said
bluntly
to
lucy
ellen
at
the
breakfast
table
lucy
ellen
blushed
nervously
oh
nonsense
cecily
she
protested
with
a
simper
it
is
nonsense
said
cecily
calmly
he
is
there
is
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
and
cromwell
biron
never
had
much
sense
the
presumption
of
him
lucy
ellen
hands
trembled
as
she
put
her
teacup
down
he
not
so
very
old
she
said
faintly
and
everybody
but
you
likes
him
and
he
i
do
see
that
there
any
presumption
maybe
not
if
you
look
at
it
so
you
very
forgiving
lucy
ellen
you
forgotten
how
he
treated
you
once
no
o
o
i
have
faltered
lucy
ellen
anyway
said
cecily
coldly
you
should
encourage
his
attentions
lucy
ellen
you
know
you
could
marry
him
even
if
he
asked
you
you
promised
all
the
fitful
color
went
out
of
lucy
ellen
face
under
pitiless
eyes
she
wilted
and
drooped
i
know
she
said
deprecatingly
i
have
forgotten
you
are
talking
nonsense
cecily
i
like
to
see
cromwell
and
he
likes
to
see
me
because
i
almost
the
only
one
of
his
old
set
that
is
left
he
feels
lonesome
in
oriental
now
lucy
ellen
lifted
her
little
head
more
erectly
at
the
last
of
her
protest
she
had
saved
her
in
the
month
that
followed
cromwell
biron
pressed
his
suit
persistently
unintimidated
by
cecily
antagonism
october
drifted
into
november
and
the
chill
drear
days
came
to
cecily
the
whole
outer
world
seemed
the
dismal
reflex
of
her
heart
yet
she
constantly
laughed
at
herself
too
and
her
laughter
was
real
if
bitter
one
evening
she
came
home
late
from
a
neighbor
cromwell
biron
passed
her
in
the
hollow
under
the
bare
boughs
of
the
maple
that
were
outlined
against
the
silvery
moonlit
sky
when
cecily
went
into
the
house
lucy
ellen
opened
the
parlor
door
she
was
very
pale
but
her
eyes
burned
in
her
face
and
her
hands
were
clasped
before
her
i
wish
you
come
in
here
for
a
few
minutes
cecily
she
said
feverishly
cecily
followed
silently
into
the
room
cecily
she
said
faintly
cromwell
was
here
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
i
told
him
to
come
night
for
his
answer
she
paused
and
looked
imploringly
at
cecily
cecily
did
not
speak
she
stood
tall
and
unrelenting
by
the
table
the
rigidity
of
her
face
and
figure
smote
lucy
ellen
like
a
blow
she
threw
out
her
bleached
little
hands
and
spoke
with
a
sudden
passion
utterly
foreign
to
her
cecily
i
want
to
marry
him
i
i
love
him
i
always
have
i
never
thought
of
this
when
i
promised
oh
cecily
you
let
me
off
my
promise
wo
you
no
said
cecily
it
was
all
she
said
lucy
ellen
hands
fell
to
her
sides
and
the
light
went
out
of
her
face
you
wo
she
said
hopelessly
cecily
went
out
at
the
door
she
turned
when
john
edwards
asked
me
to
marry
him
six
years
ago
i
said
no
for
your
sake
to
my
mind
a
promise
is
a
promise
but
you
were
always
weak
and
romantic
lucy
ellen
lucy
ellen
made
no
response
she
stood
limply
on
the
like
a
faded
blossom
bitten
by
frost
after
cromwell
biron
had
gone
away
the
next
evening
with
all
his
brisk
jauntiness
shorn
from
him
for
the
time
lucy
ellen
went
up
to
cecily
room
she
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
narrow
doorway
with
the
lamplight
striking
upward
with
a
gruesome
effect
on
her
wan
face
i
sent
him
away
she
said
lifelessly
i
kept
my
promise
cecily
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
cecily
did
not
know
what
to
say
suddenly
lucy
ellen
burst
out
bitterly
i
wish
i
was
dead
then
she
turned
swiftly
and
ran
across
the
hall
to
her
own
room
cecily
gave
a
little
moan
of
pain
this
was
her
reward
for
all
the
love
she
had
lavished
on
lucy
ellen
anyway
it
is
all
over
she
said
looking
dourly
into
the
moonlit
boughs
of
the
firs
lucy
ellen
get
over
it
when
cromwell
is
gone
she
forget
all
about
him
i
not
going
to
fret
she
promised
and
she
wanted
the
promise
first
during
the
next
fortnight
tragedy
held
grim
sway
in
the
little
house
among
the
firs
a
tragedy
tempered
with
grim
comedy
for
cecily
who
amid
all
her
agony
could
not
help
being
amused
at
lucy
ellen
romantic
way
of
sorrowing
lucy
ellen
did
her
mornings
work
listlessly
and
drooped
through
the
afternoons
cecily
would
have
felt
it
as
a
relief
if
lucy
ellen
had
upbraided
her
but
after
her
outburst
on
the
night
she
sent
cromwell
away
lucy
ellen
never
uttered
a
word
of
reproach
or
complaint
one
evening
cecily
made
a
neighborly
call
in
the
village
cromwell
biron
happened
to
be
there
and
gallantly
insisted
upon
seeing
her
home
she
understood
from
cromwell
unaltered
manner
that
lucy
ellen
had
not
told
him
why
she
had
refused
him
she
felt
a
sudden
admiration
for
her
cousin
when
they
reached
the
house
cromwell
halted
suddenly
in
the
banner
of
light
that
streamed
from
the
window
they
saw
lucy
ellen
sitting
alone
before
the
fire
her
arms
folded
on
the
table
and
her
head
bowed
on
them
her
white
cat
sat
unnoticed
at
the
table
beside
her
cecily
gave
a
gasp
of
surrender
you
better
come
in
she
said
harshly
lucy
ellen
looks
lonesome
cromwell
muttered
sheepishly
i
afraid
i
would
be
company
for
her
lucy
ellen
does
like
me
much
oh
does
she
said
cecily
bitterly
she
likes
you
better
than
she
likes
me
for
all
i
but
it
no
matter
it
been
all
my
fault
she
explain
tell
her
i
said
she
could
come
in
i
say
she
caught
the
still
reluctant
cromwell
by
the
arm
and
fairly
dragged
him
over
the
geranium
beds
and
through
the
front
door
she
opened
the
door
and
pushed
him
in
lucy
ellen
rose
in
amazement
over
cromwell
bald
head
loomed
cecily
dark
face
tragic
and
determined
here
your
beau
lucy
ellen
she
said
and
i
give
you
back
your
promise
she
shut
the
door
upon
the
sudden
illumination
of
lucy
ellen
face
and
went
with
the
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
it
my
turn
to
wish
i
was
dead
she
muttered
then
she
laughed
hysterically
that
goose
of
a
cromwell
how
queer
he
did
look
standing
there
frightened
to
death
of
lucy
ellen
poor
little
lucy
ellen
well
i
hope
he
be
good
to
her
the
pursuit
of
the
ideal
freda
snuggery
was
aglow
with
the
splendour
of
an
open
fire
which
was
triumphantly
warding
off
the
stealthy
approaches
of
the
dull
grey
autumn
twilight
roger
clair
stretched
himself
out
luxuriously
in
an
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
freda
your
armchairs
are
the
most
comfy
in
the
world
how
do
you
get
them
to
fit
into
a
fellow
kinks
so
splendidly
freda
smiled
at
him
out
of
big
owlish
eyes
that
were
the
same
tint
as
the
coppery
grey
sea
upon
which
the
north
window
of
the
snuggery
looked
any
armchair
will
fit
a
lazy
fellow
kinks
she
said
i
not
lazy
protested
roger
that
you
should
say
so
freda
when
i
have
wheeled
all
the
way
out
of
town
this
dismal
afternoon
over
the
worst
bicycle
road
in
three
kingdoms
to
see
you
bonnie
maid
i
like
lazy
people
said
freda
softly
tilting
her
spoon
on
a
cup
of
chocolate
with
a
slender
brown
hand
roger
smiled
at
her
chummily
you
are
such
a
comfortable
girl
he
said
i
like
to
talk
to
you
and
tell
you
things
you
have
something
to
tell
me
today
it
has
been
fairly
sticking
out
of
your
eyes
ever
since
you
came
now
freda
put
away
her
cup
and
saucer
got
up
and
stood
by
the
fireplace
with
one
arm
outstretched
along
the
quaintly
carved
old
mantel
she
laid
her
head
down
on
its
curve
and
looked
expectantly
at
roger
i
have
seen
my
ideal
freda
said
roger
gravely
freda
lifted
her
head
and
then
laid
it
down
again
she
did
not
speak
roger
was
glad
of
it
even
at
the
moment
he
found
himself
thinking
that
freda
had
a
genius
for
silence
any
other
girl
he
knew
would
have
broken
in
at
once
with
surprised
exclamations
and
questions
and
spoiled
his
story
you
have
not
forgotten
what
my
ideal
woman
is
like
he
said
freda
shook
her
head
she
was
not
likely
to
forget
she
remembered
only
too
keenly
the
afternoon
he
had
told
her
they
had
been
sitting
in
the
snuggery
herself
in
the
inglenook
and
roger
coiled
up
in
his
big
pet
chair
that
nobody
else
ever
sat
in
must
my
lady
be
that
i
must
love
her
he
had
quoted
well
i
will
paint
my
for
you
freda
she
must
be
tall
and
slender
with
chestnut
hair
of
wonderful
gloss
with
just
the
suggestion
of
a
ripple
in
it
she
must
have
an
oval
face
colourless
ivory
in
hue
with
the
expression
of
a
madonna
and
her
eyes
must
be
peaceful
blue
deep
and
tender
as
a
twilight
sky
freda
looking
at
herself
along
her
arm
in
the
mirror
recalled
this
description
and
smiled
faintly
she
was
short
and
plump
with
a
piquant
irregular
little
face
vivid
tinting
curly
unmanageable
hair
of
ruddy
brown
and
big
grey
eyes
certainly
she
was
not
his
ideal
when
and
where
did
you
meet
your
lady
of
the
madonna
face
and
twilight
eyes
she
asked
roger
frowned
freda
face
was
solemn
enough
but
her
eyes
looked
as
if
she
might
be
laughing
at
him
i
have
met
her
yet
i
have
only
seen
her
it
was
in
the
park
yesterday
she
was
in
a
carriage
with
the
mandersons
so
beautiful
freda
our
eyes
met
as
she
drove
past
and
i
realized
that
i
had
found
my
ideal
i
rushed
back
to
town
and
hunted
up
pete
manderson
at
the
club
pete
is
a
donkey
but
he
has
his
ways
of
being
useful
he
told
me
who
she
was
her
name
is
stephanie
gardiner
she
is
his
cousin
from
the
south
and
is
visiting
his
mother
and
freda
i
am
to
dine
at
the
mandersons
tonight
i
shall
meet
her
do
goddesses
and
ideals
and
madonnas
eat
said
freda
in
an
awed
whisper
her
eyes
were
certainly
laughing
now
roger
got
up
stiffly
i
must
confess
i
did
not
expect
that
you
would
ridicule
my
confidence
freda
he
said
frigidly
it
is
very
unlike
you
but
if
you
are
not
interested
i
will
not
bore
you
with
any
further
details
and
it
is
time
i
was
getting
back
to
town
anyhow
when
he
had
gone
freda
ran
to
the
west
window
and
flung
it
open
she
leaned
out
and
waved
both
hands
at
him
over
the
spruce
hedge
roger
roger
i
was
a
horrid
little
beast
forget
it
immediately
please
and
come
out
tomorrow
and
tell
me
all
about
her
roger
came
he
bored
freda
terribly
with
his
raptures
but
she
never
betrayed
it
she
was
all
sympathy
or
at
least
as
much
sympathy
as
a
woman
can
be
who
must
listen
while
the
man
of
men
sings
another
woman
praises
to
her
she
sent
roger
away
in
perfect
good
humour
with
himself
and
all
the
world
then
she
curled
herself
up
in
the
snuggery
pulled
a
rug
over
her
head
and
cried
roger
came
out
to
lowlands
oftener
than
ever
after
that
he
had
to
talk
to
somebody
about
stephanie
gardiner
and
freda
was
the
safest
vent
the
pursuit
of
the
ideal
as
she
called
it
went
on
with
vim
and
fervour
sometimes
roger
would
be
on
the
heights
of
hope
and
elation
the
next
visit
he
would
be
in
the
depths
of
despair
and
humility
freda
had
learned
to
tell
which
it
was
by
the
way
he
opened
the
snuggery
door
one
day
when
roger
came
he
found
six
feet
of
young
man
reposing
at
ease
in
his
particular
chair
freda
was
sipping
chocolate
in
her
corner
and
looking
over
the
rim
of
her
cup
at
the
intruder
just
as
she
had
been
wont
to
look
at
roger
she
had
on
a
new
dark
red
gown
and
looked
vivid
and
she
introduced
the
stranger
as
grayson
and
called
him
tim
they
seemed
to
be
excellent
friends
roger
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
edge
of
a
fragile
gilded
chair
which
freda
kept
to
hide
a
shabby
spot
in
the
carpet
and
glared
at
tim
until
the
latter
said
goodbye
and
lounged
out
you
be
over
tomorrow
said
freda
ca
i
come
this
evening
he
pleaded
freda
nodded
yes
and
we
make
taffy
you
used
to
make
such
delicious
stuff
tim
who
is
that
fellow
freda
roger
inquired
crossly
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
freda
began
to
make
a
fresh
pot
of
chocolate
she
smiled
dreamily
as
if
thinking
of
something
pleasant
why
that
was
tim
grayson
dear
old
tim
he
used
to
live
next
door
to
us
when
we
were
children
and
we
were
such
chums
always
together
making
mud
pies
and
getting
into
scrapes
he
is
just
the
same
old
tim
and
is
home
from
the
west
for
a
long
visit
i
was
so
glad
to
see
him
again
so
it
would
appear
said
roger
grumpily
well
now
that
old
tim
is
gone
i
suppose
i
can
have
my
own
chair
can
i
and
do
give
me
some
chocolate
i
did
know
you
made
taffy
oh
i
do
it
tim
he
can
do
everything
he
used
to
make
it
long
ago
and
i
washed
up
after
him
and
helped
him
eat
it
how
is
the
pursuit
of
the
ideal
coming
on
roger
did
not
feel
as
if
he
wanted
to
talk
about
the
ideal
he
noticed
how
vivid
freda
smile
was
and
how
lovable
were
the
curves
of
her
neck
where
the
dusky
curls
were
caught
up
from
it
he
had
also
an
inner
vision
of
freda
making
taffy
with
tim
and
he
did
not
approve
of
it
he
refused
to
talk
about
the
ideal
on
his
way
back
to
town
he
found
himself
thinking
that
freda
had
the
most
charming
glad
little
laugh
of
any
girl
he
knew
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
never
heard
the
ideal
laugh
she
smiled
placidly
he
had
raved
to
freda
about
that
smile
but
she
did
not
laugh
roger
began
to
wonder
what
an
ideal
without
any
sense
of
humour
would
be
like
when
translated
into
the
real
he
went
to
lowlands
the
next
afternoon
and
found
tim
there
in
his
chair
again
he
detested
the
fellow
but
he
could
not
deny
that
he
was
and
had
charming
manners
freda
was
very
nice
to
tim
on
his
way
back
to
town
roger
decided
that
tim
was
in
love
with
freda
he
was
furious
at
the
idea
the
presumption
of
the
man
he
also
remembered
that
he
had
not
said
a
word
to
freda
about
the
ideal
and
he
never
did
say
much
more
perhaps
because
he
could
not
get
the
chance
tim
was
always
there
before
him
and
generally
outstayed
him
one
day
when
he
went
out
he
did
not
find
freda
at
home
her
aunt
told
him
that
she
was
out
riding
with
grayson
on
his
way
back
he
met
them
as
they
cantered
by
freda
waved
her
riding
whip
at
him
her
face
was
full
of
warm
ripe
kissable
tints
her
loose
lovelocks
were
blowing
about
it
and
her
eyes
shone
like
grey
pools
mirroring
stars
roger
turned
and
watched
them
out
of
sight
behind
the
firs
that
cupped
lowlands
that
night
at
crandall
dinner
table
somebody
began
to
talk
about
freda
roger
strained
his
ears
to
listen
kitty
carr
was
speaking
kitty
knew
everything
and
everybody
she
is
simply
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
when
you
get
really
acquainted
with
her
said
kitty
with
the
air
of
having
discovered
and
patented
freda
she
is
so
vivid
and
unconventional
and
lovable
and
fire
and
dew
you
know
tim
grayson
is
a
very
lucky
fellow
are
they
engaged
someone
asked
not
yet
i
fancy
but
of
course
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
tim
simply
adores
her
he
is
a
good
soul
and
has
lots
of
money
so
do
but
really
you
know
i
think
a
prince
would
be
good
enough
for
freda
roger
suddenly
became
conscious
that
the
ideal
was
asking
him
a
question
of
which
he
had
not
heard
a
word
he
apologized
and
was
forgiven
but
he
went
home
a
very
miserable
man
he
did
not
go
to
lowlands
for
two
weeks
they
were
the
longest
most
wretched
two
weeks
he
had
ever
lived
through
one
afternoon
he
heard
that
tim
grayson
had
gone
back
west
kitty
told
it
mournfully
of
course
this
means
that
freda
has
refused
him
she
said
she
is
such
an
odd
girl
roger
went
straight
out
to
lowlands
he
found
freda
in
the
snuggery
and
held
out
his
hands
to
her
freda
will
you
marry
me
it
will
take
a
lifetime
to
tell
you
how
much
i
love
you
but
the
ideal
questioned
freda
i
have
just
discovered
what
my
ideal
is
said
roger
she
is
a
dear
loyal
companionable
little
girl
with
the
jolliest
laugh
and
the
warmest
truest
heart
in
the
world
she
has
starry
grey
eyes
two
dimples
and
a
mouth
i
must
and
will
kiss
there
there
there
freda
tell
me
you
love
me
a
little
bit
although
i
been
such
a
besotted
idiot
i
will
not
let
you
call
my
names
said
freda
snuggling
down
into
the
curve
of
his
shoulder
but
indeed
you
will
have
to
make
me
very
very
happy
to
square
matters
up
you
have
made
me
so
unutterably
unhappy
for
two
months
the
pursuit
of
the
ideal
is
ended
declared
roger
the
softening
of
miss
cynthia
i
wonder
if
i
better
flavour
this
cake
with
lemon
or
vanilla
the
most
perplexing
thing
i
ever
heard
of
in
my
life
miss
cynthia
put
down
the
bottles
with
a
vexed
frown
her
perplexity
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
flavouring
the
golden
mixture
in
her
cake
bowl
john
joe
knew
that
the
latter
had
dropped
in
in
a
flurry
of
curiosity
concerning
the
little
boy
whom
she
had
seen
about
miss
cynthia
place
for
the
last
two
days
her
daughter
kitty
was
with
her
they
both
sat
close
together
on
the
kitchen
sofa
it
too
bad
said
john
joe
sympathetically
i
do
wonder
you
are
mixed
up
so
unexpected
too
when
did
he
come
tuesday
night
said
miss
cynthia
she
had
decided
on
the
vanilla
and
was
whipping
it
briskly
in
i
saw
an
express
wagon
drive
into
the
yard
with
a
boy
and
a
trunk
in
it
and
i
went
out
just
as
he
got
down
you
my
aunt
cynthia
he
said
in
the
world
are
you
i
asked
and
he
says
wilbur
merrivale
and
my
father
was
john
merrivale
he
died
three
weeks
ago
and
he
said
i
was
to
come
to
you
because
you
were
his
sister
well
you
could
just
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
i
sure
said
john
joe
but
i
did
know
you
had
a
brother
and
his
name
merrivale
well
he
was
any
relation
really
i
was
about
six
years
old
when
my
father
married
his
mother
the
widow
merrivale
john
was
just
my
age
and
we
were
brought
up
together
just
like
brother
and
sister
he
was
a
real
nice
fellow
i
must
say
but
he
went
out
to
californy
years
ago
and
i
have
heard
a
word
of
him
for
fifteen
years
did
know
if
he
was
alive
or
dead
but
it
seems
from
what
i
can
make
out
from
the
boy
that
his
mother
died
when
he
was
a
baby
and
him
and
john
roughed
it
along
together
pretty
poor
too
i
guess
till
john
took
a
fever
and
died
and
he
told
some
of
his
friends
to
send
the
boy
to
me
for
he
no
relations
there
and
not
a
cent
in
the
world
and
the
child
came
all
the
way
from
californy
and
here
he
is
i
been
just
distracted
ever
since
i
never
been
used
to
children
and
to
have
the
house
kept
in
perpetual
uproar
is
more
than
i
can
stand
about
twelve
and
a
born
mischief
he
tear
through
the
rooms
with
his
dirty
feet
and
he
smashed
one
of
my
blue
vases
and
torn
down
a
curtain
and
set
towser
on
the
cat
half
a
dozen
times
already
i
never
was
so
worried
i
got
him
out
on
the
verandah
shelling
peas
now
to
keep
him
quiet
for
a
little
spell
i
really
sorry
for
you
said
john
joe
but
poor
child
i
suppose
he
never
had
anyone
to
look
after
him
and
come
all
the
way
from
californy
alone
too
he
must
be
real
smart
too
smart
i
guess
he
must
take
after
his
mother
whoever
she
was
for
there
ai
a
bit
of
merrivale
in
him
and
he
been
brought
up
pretty
rough
well
it
be
a
great
responsibility
for
you
cynthia
of
course
but
he
be
company
too
and
he
be
real
handy
to
run
errands
and
not
going
to
keep
him
said
miss
cynthia
determinedly
her
thin
lips
set
themselves
firmly
and
her
voice
had
a
hard
ring
not
going
to
keep
him
said
john
joe
blankly
you
ca
send
him
back
to
californy
i
do
intend
to
but
as
for
having
him
here
to
worry
my
life
out
and
keep
me
in
a
perpetual
stew
i
just
wo
do
it
d
think
going
to
trouble
myself
about
children
at
my
age
and
all
he
cost
for
clothes
and
schooling
too
i
ca
afford
it
i
do
suppose
his
father
expected
it
either
i
suppose
he
expected
me
to
look
after
him
a
bit
and
of
course
i
will
a
boy
of
his
age
ought
to
be
able
to
earn
his
keep
anyway
if
i
look
out
a
place
for
him
somewhere
where
he
can
do
odd
jobs
and
go
to
school
in
the
winter
i
think
it
all
anyone
can
expect
of
me
when
he
ai
really
no
blood
relation
miss
cynthia
flung
the
last
sentence
at
john
joe
rather
defiantly
not
liking
the
expression
on
that
lady
face
i
suppose
nobody
could
expect
more
cynthy
said
john
joe
deprecatingly
he
would
be
an
awful
bother
i
no
doubt
and
lived
alone
so
long
with
no
one
to
worry
you
that
you
would
know
what
to
do
with
him
boys
are
always
getting
into
mischief
my
four
just
keep
me
on
the
dead
jump
still
it
a
pity
for
him
poor
little
fellow
no
mother
or
father
it
seems
hard
miss
cynthia
face
grew
grimmer
than
ever
as
she
went
to
the
door
with
her
callers
and
watched
them
down
the
garden
path
as
soon
as
john
joe
saw
that
the
door
was
shut
she
unburdened
her
mind
to
her
daughter
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
the
like
i
thought
i
knew
cynthia
henderson
well
if
anybody
in
wilmot
did
but
this
beats
me
just
think
kitty
there
she
is
no
one
knows
how
rich
and
not
a
soul
in
the
world
belonging
to
her
and
she
wo
even
take
in
her
child
she
must
be
a
hard
woman
but
it
just
meanness
pure
and
simple
she
grudges
him
what
he
eat
and
wear
the
poor
mite
look
as
if
he
need
much
cynthia
did
used
to
be
like
that
but
it
growing
on
her
every
day
she
got
hard
as
rocks
that
afternoon
miss
cynthia
harnessed
her
fat
grey
pony
into
the
phaeton
herself
she
kept
neither
man
nor
maid
but
lived
in
her
big
immaculate
house
in
solitary
state
and
drove
away
down
the
dusty
road
leaving
wilbur
sitting
on
the
verandah
she
returned
in
an
hour
time
and
drove
into
the
yard
shutting
the
gate
behind
her
with
a
vigorous
snap
wilbur
was
not
in
sight
and
fearful
lest
he
should
be
in
mischief
she
hurriedly
tied
the
pony
to
the
railing
and
went
in
search
of
him
she
found
him
sitting
by
the
well
his
chin
in
his
hands
he
was
pale
and
his
eyes
were
red
miss
cynthia
hardened
her
heart
and
took
him
into
the
house
i
been
down
to
see
robins
this
afternoon
wilbur
she
said
pretending
to
brush
some
invisible
dust
from
the
bottom
of
her
nice
black
cashmere
skirt
for
an
excuse
to
avoid
looking
at
him
and
agreed
to
take
you
on
trial
it
a
real
good
chance
better
than
you
could
expect
he
says
he
board
and
clothe
you
and
let
you
go
to
school
in
the
winter
the
boy
seemed
to
shrink
daddy
said
that
i
would
stay
with
you
he
said
wistfully
he
said
you
were
so
good
and
kind
and
would
love
me
for
his
sake
for
a
moment
miss
cynthia
softened
she
had
been
very
fond
of
her
stepbrother
it
seemed
that
his
voice
appealed
to
her
across
the
grave
in
behalf
of
his
child
but
the
crust
of
years
was
not
to
be
so
easily
broken
your
father
meant
that
i
would
look
after
you
she
said
and
i
mean
to
but
i
ca
afford
to
keep
you
here
you
have
a
good
place
at
robins
if
you
behave
yourself
i
going
to
take
you
down
now
before
i
unharness
the
pony
so
go
and
wash
your
face
while
i
put
up
your
things
do
look
so
woebegone
for
pity
sake
i
not
taking
you
to
prison
wilbur
turned
and
went
silently
to
the
kitchen
miss
cynthia
thought
she
heard
a
sob
she
went
with
a
firm
step
into
the
little
bedroom
off
the
hall
and
took
a
purse
out
of
a
drawer
i
i
ought
she
said
doubtfully
i
do
he
has
a
cent
i
daresay
he
lose
or
waste
it
she
counted
out
cents
carefully
when
she
came
out
wilbur
was
at
the
door
she
put
the
money
awkwardly
into
his
hand
there
see
that
you
do
spend
it
on
any
foolishness
miss
cynthia
action
made
a
good
deal
of
talk
in
wilmot
the
women
headed
by
john
joe
who
said
behind
cynthia
back
what
she
did
not
dare
say
to
her
face
condemned
her
the
men
laughed
and
said
that
cynthia
was
a
shrewd
one
there
was
no
getting
round
her
miss
cynthia
herself
was
far
from
easy
she
could
not
forget
wilbur
wistful
eyes
and
she
had
heard
that
robins
was
a
hard
master
a
week
after
the
boy
had
gone
she
saw
him
one
day
at
the
store
he
was
lifting
heavy
bags
from
a
cart
the
work
was
beyond
his
strength
and
he
was
flushed
and
panting
miss
cynthia
conscience
gave
her
a
hard
stab
she
bought
a
roll
of
peppermints
and
took
them
over
to
him
he
thanked
her
timidly
and
drove
quickly
away
robins
has
any
business
putting
such
work
on
a
child
she
said
to
herself
indignantly
i
speak
to
him
about
it
and
she
did
and
got
an
answer
that
made
her
ears
tingle
robins
bluntly
told
her
he
guessed
he
knew
what
was
what
about
his
hands
he
were
no
nigger
driver
if
she
was
satisfied
she
might
take
the
boy
away
as
soon
as
she
liked
miss
cynthia
did
not
get
much
comfort
out
of
life
that
summer
almost
everywhere
she
went
she
was
sure
to
meet
wilbur
engaged
in
some
hard
task
she
could
not
help
seeing
how
miserably
pale
and
thin
he
had
become
the
worry
had
its
effect
on
her
the
neighbours
said
that
cynthy
was
sharper
than
ever
even
her
was
embittered
she
had
always
enjoyed
walking
up
the
aisle
with
her
rich
silk
skirt
rustling
over
the
carpet
her
cashmere
shawl
folded
correctly
over
her
shoulders
and
her
lace
bonnet
set
precisely
on
her
thin
shining
crimps
but
she
could
take
no
pleasure
in
that
or
in
the
sermon
now
when
wilbur
sat
right
across
from
her
pew
between
robins
and
his
wife
the
boy
eyes
had
grown
too
large
for
his
thin
face
the
softening
of
miss
cynthia
was
a
very
gradual
process
but
it
reached
a
climax
one
september
morning
when
john
joe
came
into
the
former
kitchen
with
an
important
face
miss
cynthia
was
preserving
her
plums
no
thank
you
i
not
sit
down
i
only
run
in
i
suppose
heard
it
that
little
merrivale
boy
has
took
awful
sick
with
fever
they
say
he
been
worked
half
to
death
this
summer
everyone
knows
what
robins
is
with
his
help
and
they
say
he
has
fretted
a
good
deal
for
his
father
and
been
homesick
and
he
run
down
i
anyway
robins
took
him
over
to
the
hospital
at
stanford
last
night
good
gracious
cynthy
are
you
sick
miss
cynthia
had
staggered
to
a
seat
by
the
table
her
face
was
pallid
no
it
only
your
news
gave
me
a
turn
it
came
so
suddenly
i
know
i
must
hurry
back
and
see
to
the
men
dinners
i
thought
i
come
and
tell
you
though
i
did
know
as
you
care
this
parting
shot
was
unheeded
by
miss
cynthia
she
laid
her
face
in
her
hands
it
a
judgement
on
me
she
moaned
he
going
to
die
and
i
his
murderess
this
is
the
account
i
have
to
give
john
merrivale
of
his
boy
i
been
a
wicked
selfish
woman
and
justly
punished
it
was
a
humbled
miss
cynthia
who
met
the
doctor
at
the
hospital
that
afternoon
he
shook
his
head
at
her
eager
questions
it
a
pretty
bad
case
the
boy
seems
run
down
every
way
no
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
moving
him
again
bringing
him
here
last
night
did
him
a
great
deal
of
harm
yes
you
may
see
him
but
he
will
not
know
you
i
fear
he
is
delirious
and
raves
of
his
father
and
california
miss
cynthia
followed
the
doctor
down
the
long
ward
when
he
paused
by
a
cot
she
pushed
past
him
wilbur
lay
tossing
restlessly
on
his
pillow
he
was
thin
to
emaciation
but
his
cheeks
were
crimson
and
his
eyes
burning
bright
miss
cynthia
stooped
and
took
the
hot
dry
hands
in
hers
wilbur
she
sobbed
do
you
know
me
aunt
cynthia
you
are
not
my
aunt
cynthia
said
wilbur
daddy
said
aunt
cynthia
was
good
and
kind
you
are
a
cross
bad
woman
i
want
daddy
why
does
he
come
why
does
he
come
to
little
wilbur
miss
cynthia
got
up
and
faced
the
doctor
he
to
get
better
she
said
stubbornly
spare
no
expense
or
trouble
if
he
dies
i
will
be
a
murderess
he
must
live
and
give
me
a
chance
to
make
it
up
for
him
and
he
did
live
but
for
a
long
time
it
was
a
hard
fight
and
there
were
days
when
it
seemed
that
death
must
win
miss
cynthia
got
so
thin
and
wan
that
even
john
joe
pitied
her
the
earth
seemed
to
miss
cynthia
to
laugh
out
in
prodigal
joyousness
on
the
afternoon
she
drove
home
when
wilbur
had
been
pronounced
out
of
danger
how
tranquil
the
hills
looked
with
warm
october
sunshine
sleeping
on
their
sides
and
faint
blue
hazes
on
their
brows
how
gallantly
the
maples
flaunted
their
crimson
flags
how
kind
and
friendly
was
every
face
she
met
afterwards
miss
cynthia
said
she
began
to
live
that
day
wilbur
recovery
was
slow
every
day
miss
cynthia
drove
over
with
some
dainty
and
her
loving
gentleness
sat
none
the
less
gracefully
on
her
because
of
its
newness
wilbur
grew
to
look
for
and
welcome
her
coming
when
it
was
thought
safe
to
remove
him
miss
cynthia
went
to
the
hospital
with
a
of
shawls
and
pillows
i
have
come
to
take
you
away
she
said
wilbur
shrank
back
not
to
robins
he
said
piteously
oh
not
there
aunt
cynthia
of
course
not
miss
cynthia
said
them
notorious
pigs
john
harrington
was
a
or
thought
that
he
was
which
amounts
to
the
same
thing
he
was
and
having
been
handsome
in
his
youth
was
a
man
still
he
had
a
remarkably
good
farm
and
was
a
remarkably
good
farmer
he
also
had
a
garden
which
was
the
pride
and
delight
of
his
heart
or
at
least
it
was
before
hayden
pigs
got
into
it
sarah
king
harrington
aunt
and
housekeeper
was
deaf
and
crabbed
and
very
few
visitors
ever
came
to
the
house
this
suited
harrington
he
was
a
good
citizen
and
did
his
duty
by
the
community
but
his
bump
of
sociability
was
undeveloped
he
was
also
a
contented
man
looking
after
his
farm
improving
his
stock
and
experimenting
with
new
bulbs
in
undisturbed
serenity
this
however
was
all
too
good
to
last
a
man
is
bound
to
have
some
troubles
in
this
life
and
harrington
were
near
their
beginning
when
perry
hayden
bought
the
adjoining
farm
from
the
heirs
of
shakespeare
ely
deceased
and
moved
in
to
be
sure
perry
hayden
poor
fellow
did
not
bother
harrington
much
for
he
died
of
pneumonia
a
month
after
he
came
there
but
his
widow
carried
on
the
farm
with
the
assistance
of
a
lank
hired
boy
her
own
children
charles
and
theodore
commonly
known
as
bobbles
and
ted
were
as
yet
little
more
than
babies
the
real
trouble
began
when
mary
hayden
pigs
fourteen
in
number
and
of
voracity
got
into
harrington
garden
a
railing
a
fir
grove
and
an
apple
orchard
separated
the
two
establishments
but
these
failed
to
keep
the
pigs
within
bounds
harrington
had
just
got
his
garden
planted
for
the
season
and
to
go
out
one
morning
and
find
a
horde
of
enterprising
porkers
rooting
about
in
it
was
to
put
it
mildly
trying
he
was
angry
but
as
it
was
a
first
offence
he
drove
the
pigs
out
with
tolerable
calmness
mended
the
fence
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
repairing
damages
three
days
later
the
pigs
got
in
again
harrington
relieved
his
mind
by
some
scathing
reflections
on
women
who
tried
to
run
farms
then
he
sent
mordecai
his
hired
man
over
to
the
hayden
place
to
ask
hayden
if
she
would
be
kind
enough
to
keep
her
pigs
out
of
his
garden
hayden
sent
back
word
that
she
was
very
sorry
and
would
not
let
it
occur
again
nobody
not
even
john
harrington
could
doubt
that
she
meant
what
she
said
but
she
had
reckoned
without
the
pigs
they
had
not
forgotten
the
flavour
of
egyptian
fleshpots
as
represented
by
the
succulent
young
shoots
in
the
harrington
domains
a
week
later
mordecai
came
in
and
told
harrington
that
them
notorious
pigs
were
in
his
garden
again
there
is
a
limit
to
everyone
patience
harrington
left
mordecai
to
drive
them
out
while
he
put
on
his
hat
and
stalked
over
to
the
haydens
place
ted
and
bobbles
were
playing
at
marbles
in
the
lane
and
ran
when
they
saw
him
coming
he
got
close
up
to
the
little
low
house
among
the
apple
trees
before
mordecai
appeared
in
the
yard
driving
the
pigs
around
the
barn
hayden
was
sitting
on
her
doorstep
paring
her
dinner
potatoes
and
stood
up
hastily
when
she
saw
her
visitor
harrington
had
never
seen
his
neighbour
at
close
quarters
before
now
he
could
not
help
seeing
that
she
was
a
very
pretty
little
woman
with
wistful
dark
blue
eyes
and
an
appealing
expression
mary
hayden
had
been
next
to
a
beauty
in
her
girlhood
and
she
had
a
good
deal
of
her
bloom
left
yet
although
hard
work
and
worry
were
doing
their
best
to
rob
her
of
it
but
john
harrington
was
an
angry
man
and
did
not
care
whether
the
woman
in
question
was
pretty
or
not
her
pigs
had
rooted
up
his
garden
that
fact
filled
his
mind
hayden
those
pigs
of
yours
have
been
in
my
garden
again
i
simply
ca
put
up
with
this
any
longer
why
in
the
name
of
reason
do
you
look
after
your
animals
better
if
i
find
them
in
again
set
my
dog
on
them
i
give
you
fair
warning
a
faint
colour
had
crept
into
mary
hayden
soft
cheeks
during
this
tirade
and
her
voice
trembled
as
she
said
i
very
sorry
harrington
i
suppose
bobbles
forgot
to
shut
the
gate
of
their
pen
again
this
morning
he
is
so
forgetful
i
lengthen
his
memory
then
if
i
were
you
returned
harrington
grimly
supposing
that
bobbles
was
the
hired
man
i
not
going
to
have
my
garden
ruined
just
because
he
happens
to
be
forgetful
i
am
speaking
my
mind
plainly
madam
if
you
ca
keep
your
stock
from
being
a
nuisance
to
other
people
you
ought
not
to
try
to
run
a
farm
at
all
then
did
hayden
sit
down
upon
the
doorstep
and
burst
into
tears
harrington
felt
as
sarah
king
would
have
expressed
it
every
which
way
at
once
here
was
a
nice
mess
what
a
nuisance
women
were
worse
than
the
pigs
oh
do
cry
hayden
he
said
awkwardly
i
did
mean
well
i
suppose
i
spoke
too
strongly
of
course
i
know
you
did
mean
to
let
the
pigs
in
there
do
stop
crying
i
beg
your
pardon
if
i
hurt
your
feelings
oh
it
is
that
sobbed
hayden
wiping
away
her
tears
only
i
tried
so
hard
and
everything
seems
to
go
wrong
i
make
such
mistakes
as
for
your
garden
sir
i
pay
for
the
damage
my
pigs
have
done
if
you
let
me
know
what
it
comes
to
she
sobbed
again
and
caught
her
breath
like
a
grieved
child
harrington
felt
like
a
brute
he
had
a
queer
notion
that
if
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
told
her
not
to
worry
over
things
women
were
not
created
to
attend
to
he
would
be
expressing
his
feelings
better
than
in
any
other
way
but
of
course
he
could
do
that
instead
he
muttered
that
the
damage
did
amount
to
much
after
all
and
he
hoped
she
would
mind
what
he
said
and
then
he
got
himself
away
and
strode
through
the
orchard
like
a
man
in
a
desperate
hurry
mordecai
had
gone
home
and
the
pigs
were
not
to
be
seen
but
a
chubby
little
face
peeped
at
him
from
between
two
scrub
cherry
trees
you
bad
man
said
bobbles
vindictively
you
made
my
mommer
cry
i
saw
you
i
only
bobbles
now
but
when
i
grow
up
be
charles
henry
hayden
and
you
wo
dare
to
make
my
mommer
cry
then
harrington
smiled
grimly
so
you
the
lad
who
forgets
to
shut
the
pigpen
gate
are
you
come
out
here
and
let
me
see
you
who
is
in
there
with
you
ted
is
he
littler
than
me
but
i
wo
come
out
i
do
like
you
home
harrington
obeyed
he
went
home
and
to
work
in
his
garden
but
work
as
hard
as
he
would
he
could
not
forget
mary
hayden
grieved
face
i
was
a
brute
he
thought
why
could
i
have
mentioned
the
matter
gently
i
daresay
she
has
enough
to
trouble
her
confound
those
pigs
after
that
there
was
a
time
of
calm
evidently
something
had
been
done
to
bobbles
memory
or
perhaps
hayden
attended
to
the
gate
herself
at
all
events
the
pigs
were
not
seen
and
harrington
garden
blossomed
like
the
rose
but
harrington
himself
was
in
a
bad
state
for
one
thing
wherever
he
looked
he
saw
the
mental
picture
of
his
neighbour
tired
sweet
face
and
the
tears
in
her
blue
eyes
the
original
he
never
saw
which
only
made
matters
worse
he
wondered
what
opinion
she
had
of
him
and
decided
that
she
must
think
him
a
cross
old
bear
this
worried
him
he
wished
the
pigs
would
break
in
again
so
that
he
might
have
a
chance
to
show
how
forbearing
he
could
be
one
day
he
gathered
a
nice
mess
of
tender
young
greens
and
sent
them
over
to
hayden
by
mordecai
at
first
he
had
thought
of
sending
her
some
flowers
but
that
seemed
silly
and
besides
mordecai
and
flowers
were
incongruous
hayden
sent
back
a
very
pretty
message
of
thanks
whereat
harrington
looked
radiant
and
mordecai
who
could
see
through
a
stone
wall
as
well
as
most
people
went
out
to
the
barn
and
chuckled
ef
the
little
widder
hai
caught
him
who
it
the
next
day
one
adventurous
pig
found
its
way
alone
into
the
harrington
garden
harrington
saw
it
get
in
and
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
hayden
running
through
her
orchard
she
was
in
his
yard
by
the
time
he
got
out
her
sunbonnet
had
fallen
back
and
some
loose
tendrils
of
her
auburn
hair
were
curling
around
her
forehead
her
cheeks
were
so
pink
and
her
eyes
so
bright
from
running
that
she
looked
almost
girlish
oh
harrington
she
said
breathlessly
that
pet
pig
of
is
in
your
garden
again
he
only
got
in
this
minute
i
saw
him
coming
and
i
ran
right
after
him
he
there
all
right
said
harrington
cheerfully
but
i
get
him
out
in
a
jiffy
do
tire
yourself
wo
you
go
into
the
house
and
rest
while
i
drive
him
around
hayden
however
was
determined
to
help
and
they
both
went
around
to
the
garden
set
the
gate
open
and
tried
to
drive
the
pig
out
but
harrington
was
not
thinking
about
pigs
and
hayden
did
not
know
quite
so
much
about
driving
them
as
mordecai
did
as
a
consequence
they
did
not
make
much
headway
in
her
excitement
hayden
ran
over
beds
and
whatever
came
in
her
way
and
harrington
in
order
to
keep
near
her
ran
after
her
between
them
they
spoiled
things
about
as
much
as
a
whole
drove
of
pigs
would
have
done
but
at
last
the
pig
grew
tired
of
the
fun
bolted
out
of
the
gate
and
ran
across
the
yard
to
his
own
place
hayden
followed
slowly
and
harrington
walked
beside
her
those
pigs
are
all
to
be
shut
up
tomorrow
she
said
hiram
has
been
fixing
up
a
place
for
them
in
his
spare
moments
and
it
is
ready
at
last
oh
i
would
said
harrington
hastily
it
is
good
for
pigs
to
be
shut
up
so
young
you
better
let
them
run
a
while
yet
no
said
hayden
decidedly
they
have
almost
worried
me
to
death
already
in
they
go
tomorrow
they
were
at
the
lane
gate
now
and
harrington
had
to
open
it
and
let
her
pass
through
he
felt
quite
desperate
as
he
watched
her
trip
up
through
the
rows
of
apple
trees
her
blue
gingham
skirt
brushing
the
lush
grasses
where
a
lacy
tangle
of
sunbeams
and
shadows
lay
bobbles
and
ted
came
running
to
meet
her
and
the
three
hand
in
hand
disappeared
from
sight
harrington
went
back
to
the
house
feeling
that
life
was
flat
stale
and
unprofitable
that
evening
at
the
tea
table
he
caught
himself
wondering
what
it
would
be
like
to
see
mary
hayden
sitting
at
his
table
in
place
of
sarah
king
with
bobbles
and
ted
on
either
hand
then
he
found
out
what
was
the
matter
with
him
he
was
in
love
fathoms
deep
with
the
widow
presumably
the
pigs
were
shut
up
the
next
day
for
harrington
garden
was
invaded
no
more
he
stood
it
for
a
week
and
then
surrendered
at
discretion
he
filled
a
basket
with
early
strawberries
and
went
across
to
the
hayden
place
boldly
enough
to
all
appearance
but
with
his
heart
thumping
like
any
schoolboy
the
front
door
stood
hospitably
open
flanked
by
rows
of
defiant
red
and
yellow
hollyhocks
harrington
paused
on
the
step
with
his
hand
outstretched
to
knock
somewhere
inside
he
heard
a
low
sobbing
forgetting
all
about
knocking
he
stepped
softly
in
and
walked
to
the
door
of
the
little
bobbles
was
standing
behind
him
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
but
harrington
did
not
see
him
he
was
looking
at
mary
hayden
who
was
sitting
by
the
table
in
the
room
with
her
arms
flung
out
over
it
and
her
head
bowed
on
them
she
was
crying
softly
in
a
hopeless
fashion
harrington
put
down
his
strawberries
mary
he
exclaimed
hayden
straightened
herself
up
with
a
start
and
looked
at
him
her
lips
quivering
and
her
eyes
full
of
tears
what
is
the
matter
said
harrington
anxiously
is
anything
wrong
oh
nothing
much
said
hayden
trying
to
recover
herself
yes
there
is
too
but
it
is
very
foolish
of
me
to
be
going
on
like
this
i
did
know
anyone
was
near
and
i
was
feeling
so
discouraged
the
colt
broke
his
leg
in
the
swamp
pasture
today
and
hiram
had
to
shoot
him
it
was
ted
colt
but
there
there
is
no
use
in
crying
over
it
and
by
way
of
proving
this
the
poor
tired
overburdened
little
woman
began
to
cry
again
she
was
past
caring
whether
harrington
saw
her
or
not
the
was
so
distressed
that
he
forgot
to
be
nervous
he
sat
down
and
put
his
arm
around
her
and
spoke
out
what
was
in
his
mind
without
further
parley
do
cry
mary
listen
to
me
you
were
never
meant
to
run
a
farm
and
be
killed
with
worry
you
ought
to
be
looked
after
and
petted
i
want
you
to
marry
me
and
then
everything
will
be
all
right
i
loved
you
ever
since
that
day
i
came
over
here
and
made
you
cry
do
you
think
you
can
like
me
a
little
mary
it
may
be
that
hayden
was
not
very
much
surprised
because
harrington
face
had
been
like
an
open
book
the
day
they
chased
the
pig
out
of
the
garden
together
as
for
what
she
said
perhaps
bobbles
who
was
surreptitiously
gorging
himself
on
harrington
strawberries
may
tell
you
but
i
certainly
shall
not
the
little
brown
house
among
the
apple
trees
is
shut
up
now
and
the
boundary
fence
belongs
to
ancient
history
sarah
king
has
gone
also
and
john
harrington
reigns
royally
in
her
place
bobbles
and
ted
have
a
small
sister
and
there
is
a
pig
on
the
estate
who
may
die
of
old
age
but
will
never
meet
his
doom
otherwise
it
is
bobbles
pig
and
one
of
the
famous
fourteen
mordecai
still
shambles
around
and
worships
harrington
the
garden
is
the
same
as
of
yore
but
the
house
is
a
different
place
and
harrington
is
a
different
man
and
mordecai
will
tell
you
with
a
chuckle
it
was
them
notorious
pigs
as
did
it
all
why
not
ask
miss
price
frances
allen
came
in
from
the
post
office
and
laid
an
open
letter
on
the
table
beside
her
mother
who
was
making
mincemeat
alma
allen
looked
up
from
the
cake
she
was
frosting
to
ask
what
is
the
matter
you
look
as
if
your
letter
contained
unwelcome
news
fan
so
it
does
it
is
from
aunt
clara
to
say
she
can
not
come
she
has
received
a
telegram
that
her
is
very
ill
and
she
must
go
to
her
at
once
allen
looked
regretful
and
alma
cast
her
spoon
away
with
a
tragic
air
that
is
too
bad
i
feel
as
if
our
celebration
were
spoiled
but
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
no
agreed
frances
sitting
down
and
beginning
to
peel
apples
so
there
is
no
use
in
lamenting
or
i
would
certainly
sit
down
and
cry
i
feel
so
disappointed
is
uncle
frank
coming
yes
aunt
clara
says
he
will
come
down
from
stellarton
if
king
does
not
get
worse
so
that
will
leave
just
one
vacant
place
we
must
invite
someone
to
fill
it
up
who
shall
it
be
both
girls
looked
rather
puzzled
allen
smiled
a
quiet
little
smile
all
to
herself
and
went
on
chopping
suet
she
had
handed
the
thanksgiving
dinner
over
to
frances
and
alma
this
year
they
were
to
attend
to
all
the
preparations
and
invite
all
the
guests
but
although
they
had
made
or
planned
several
innovations
in
the
dinner
itself
they
had
made
no
change
in
the
usual
list
of
guests
it
must
just
be
the
family
affair
frances
had
declared
if
we
begin
inviting
other
folks
there
is
no
knowing
when
to
draw
the
line
we
ca
have
more
than
fourteen
and
some
of
our
friends
would
be
sure
to
feel
slighted
so
the
same
old
list
it
was
but
now
aunt
clara
dear
jolly
aunt
clara
whom
everybody
in
the
connection
loved
and
admired
could
not
come
and
her
place
must
be
filled
we
ca
invite
the
new
minister
because
we
would
have
to
have
his
sister
too
said
frances
and
there
is
no
reason
for
asking
any
one
of
our
girl
chums
more
than
another
mother
you
will
have
to
help
us
out
said
alma
ca
you
suggest
a
substitute
guest
allen
looked
down
at
the
two
bright
girlish
faces
turned
up
to
her
and
said
slowly
i
think
i
can
but
i
am
not
sure
my
choice
will
please
you
why
not
ask
miss
price
miss
price
they
had
never
thought
of
her
she
was
the
pale
little
teacher
in
the
primary
department
of
the
hazelwood
school
miss
price
repeated
frances
slowly
why
mother
we
hardly
know
her
she
is
dreadfully
dull
and
quiet
i
think
and
so
shy
said
alma
why
at
the
wards
party
the
other
night
she
looked
startled
to
death
if
anyone
spoke
to
her
i
believe
she
would
be
frightened
to
come
here
for
thanksgiving
she
is
a
very
lonely
little
creature
said
allen
gently
and
does
seem
to
have
anyone
belonging
to
her
i
think
she
would
be
very
glad
to
get
an
invitation
to
spend
thanksgiving
elsewhere
than
in
that
cheerless
little
where
she
lives
of
course
if
you
would
like
to
have
her
mother
we
will
ask
her
said
frances
no
girls
said
allen
seriously
you
must
not
ask
miss
price
on
my
account
if
you
do
not
feel
prepared
to
make
her
welcome
for
her
own
sake
i
had
hoped
that
your
own
kind
hearts
might
have
prompted
you
to
extend
a
little
thanksgiving
cheer
in
a
truly
thanksgiving
spirit
to
a
lonely
girl
whose
life
i
do
not
think
is
a
happy
one
but
there
i
shall
not
preach
this
is
your
dinner
and
you
must
please
yourselves
as
to
your
guests
frances
and
alma
had
both
flushed
and
they
now
remained
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
frances
sprang
up
and
threw
her
arms
around
her
mother
you
right
mother
dear
as
you
always
are
and
we
are
very
selfish
girls
we
will
ask
miss
price
and
try
to
give
her
a
nice
time
i
go
down
this
very
evening
and
see
her
in
the
grey
twilight
of
the
chilly
autumn
evening
bertha
price
walked
home
to
her
her
pale
little
face
paler
and
her
grey
eyes
sadder
than
ever
in
the
fading
light
only
two
days
until
thanksgiving
but
there
would
be
no
real
thanksgiving
for
her
why
she
asked
herself
rebelliously
when
there
seemed
so
much
love
in
the
world
was
she
denied
her
share
her
landlady
met
her
in
the
hall
miss
allen
is
in
the
parlour
miss
price
she
wants
to
see
you
bertha
went
into
the
parlour
somewhat
reluctantly
she
had
met
frances
allen
only
once
or
twice
and
she
was
secretly
almost
afraid
of
the
handsome
vivacious
girl
who
was
so
different
from
herself
i
am
sorry
you
have
had
to
wait
miss
allen
she
said
shyly
i
went
to
see
a
pupil
of
mine
who
is
ill
and
i
was
kept
later
than
i
expected
my
errand
wo
take
very
long
said
frances
brightly
mother
wants
you
to
spend
thanksgiving
day
with
us
miss
price
if
you
have
no
other
engagement
we
will
have
a
few
other
guests
but
nobody
outside
our
own
family
except
seeley
who
is
the
law
partner
and
intimate
friend
of
my
brother
ernest
in
town
you
come
wo
you
oh
thank
you
yes
said
bertha
in
pleased
surprise
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
go
why
it
is
so
nice
to
think
of
it
i
expected
my
thanksgiving
day
to
be
lonely
and
sad
not
a
bit
thanksgivingy
we
shall
expect
you
then
said
frances
with
a
cordial
little
come
early
in
the
morning
and
we
will
have
a
real
friendly
pleasant
day
that
night
frances
said
to
her
mother
and
sister
you
never
saw
such
a
transfigured
face
as
miss
price
when
i
asked
her
up
she
looked
positively
pretty
such
a
lovely
pink
came
out
on
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
she
reminded
me
so
much
of
somebody
i
seen
but
i
ca
think
who
it
is
i
so
glad
we
asked
her
here
for
thanksgiving
thanksgiving
came
as
bright
and
beautiful
as
a
day
could
be
and
the
allens
guests
came
with
it
bertha
price
was
among
them
paler
and
shyer
than
ever
ernest
allen
and
his
friend
maxwell
seeley
came
out
from
town
on
the
morning
train
after
all
the
necessary
introductions
had
been
made
frances
flew
to
the
kitchen
i
found
out
who
it
is
miss
price
reminds
me
of
she
said
as
she
bustled
about
the
range
it
max
seeley
you
need
laugh
al
a
fact
i
noticed
it
the
minute
i
introduced
them
he
plump
and
prosperous
and
she
pinched
and
pale
but
there
a
resemblance
nevertheless
look
for
yourself
and
see
if
it
is
so
back
in
the
big
cheery
parlour
the
thanksgiving
guests
were
amusing
themselves
in
various
ways
max
seeley
had
given
an
odd
little
start
when
he
was
introduced
to
miss
price
and
as
soon
as
possible
he
followed
her
to
the
corner
where
she
had
taken
refuge
ernest
allen
was
out
in
the
kitchen
talking
to
his
sisters
the
uncles
and
cousins
and
aunts
were
all
chattering
to
each
other
and
seeley
and
miss
price
were
quite
unnoticed
you
will
excuse
me
wo
you
miss
price
if
i
ask
you
something
about
yourself
he
said
eagerly
the
truth
is
you
look
so
strikingly
like
someone
i
used
to
know
that
i
feel
sure
you
must
be
related
to
her
i
do
not
think
i
have
any
relatives
of
your
name
have
you
any
of
mine
bertha
flushed
hesitated
for
an
instant
then
said
frankly
no
i
do
not
think
so
but
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
price
is
not
my
real
name
and
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
although
i
think
it
begins
with
i
believe
that
my
parents
died
when
i
was
about
three
years
old
and
i
was
then
taken
to
an
orphan
asylum
the
next
year
i
was
taken
from
there
and
adopted
by
price
she
was
very
kind
to
me
and
treated
me
as
her
own
daughter
i
had
a
happy
home
with
her
although
we
were
poor
price
wished
me
to
bear
her
name
and
i
did
so
she
never
told
me
my
true
surname
perhaps
she
did
not
know
it
she
died
when
i
was
sixteen
and
since
then
i
have
been
quite
alone
in
the
world
that
is
all
i
know
about
myself
max
seeley
was
plainly
excited
why
do
you
think
your
real
name
begins
with
s
he
asked
i
have
a
watch
which
belonged
to
my
mother
with
the
monogram
on
the
case
it
was
left
with
the
matron
of
the
asylum
and
she
gave
it
to
price
for
me
here
it
is
max
seeley
almost
snatched
the
little
silver
watch
from
her
hand
and
opened
the
case
an
exclamation
escaped
him
as
he
pointed
to
some
scratches
on
the
inner
side
they
looked
like
the
initials
let
me
tell
my
story
now
he
said
my
name
is
maxwell
seeley
my
father
died
when
i
was
seven
years
old
and
my
mother
a
year
later
my
little
sister
bertha
then
three
years
old
and
i
were
left
quite
alone
and
very
poor
we
had
no
relatives
i
was
adopted
by
a
old
bachelor
who
had
known
my
father
my
sister
was
taken
to
an
orphan
asylum
in
a
city
some
distance
away
i
was
very
much
attached
to
her
and
grieved
bitterly
over
our
parting
my
adopted
father
was
very
kind
to
me
and
gave
me
a
good
education
i
did
not
forget
my
sister
and
as
soon
as
i
could
i
went
to
the
asylum
i
found
that
she
had
been
taken
away
long
before
and
i
could
not
even
discover
who
had
adopted
her
for
the
original
building
with
all
its
records
had
been
destroyed
by
fire
two
years
previous
to
my
visit
i
never
could
find
any
clue
to
her
whereabouts
and
long
since
gave
up
all
hope
of
finding
her
but
i
have
found
her
at
last
you
are
bertha
seeley
my
little
sister
oh
can
it
be
possible
more
than
possible
it
is
certain
you
are
the
image
of
my
mother
as
i
remember
her
and
as
an
old
daguerreotype
i
have
pictures
her
and
this
is
her
watch
see
i
scratched
my
own
initials
on
the
case
one
day
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
world
oh
bertha
are
you
half
as
glad
as
i
am
glad
bertha
eyes
were
shining
like
stars
she
tried
to
smile
but
burst
into
tears
instead
and
her
head
went
down
on
her
brother
shoulder
by
this
time
everybody
in
the
room
was
staring
at
the
extraordinary
tableau
and
ernest
coming
through
the
hall
gave
a
whistle
of
astonishment
that
brought
the
two
in
the
corner
back
to
a
sense
of
their
surroundings
i
have
suddenly
gone
crazy
ernest
old
fellow
smiled
max
ladies
and
gentlemen
all
this
little
was
introduced
to
you
as
miss
price
but
that
was
a
mistake
let
me
introduce
her
again
as
miss
bertha
seeley
my
and
sister
well
they
had
an
amazing
time
then
of
course
they
laughed
and
questioned
and
explained
until
the
dinner
was
in
imminent
danger
of
getting
on
the
table
luckily
alma
and
frances
remembered
it
just
in
the
nick
of
time
and
they
all
got
out
somehow
and
into
their
places
it
was
a
splendid
dinner
but
i
believe
that
maxwell
and
bertha
seeley
did
know
what
they
were
eating
any
more
than
if
it
had
been
sawdust
however
the
rest
of
the
guests
made
up
for
that
and
did
full
justice
to
the
girls
cookery
in
the
afternoon
they
all
went
to
church
and
at
least
two
hearts
were
truly
and
devoutly
thankful
that
day
when
the
dusk
came
ernest
and
maxwell
had
to
catch
the
last
train
for
town
and
the
other
guests
went
home
with
the
exception
of
bertha
who
was
to
stay
all
night
just
as
soon
as
her
resignation
could
be
effected
she
was
to
join
her
brother
meanwhile
i
see
about
getting
a
house
to
put
you
in
said
max
no
more
boarding
out
for
me
ernest
you
may
consider
me
as
a
family
man
henceforth
frances
and
alma
talked
it
all
over
before
they
went
to
sleep
that
night
just
think
said
frances
if
we
had
asked
her
here
today
she
might
never
have
found
her
brother
it
all
mother
doing
bless
her
things
do
happen
like
a
storybook
sometimes
do
they
al
and
did
i
tell
you
they
looked
alike
