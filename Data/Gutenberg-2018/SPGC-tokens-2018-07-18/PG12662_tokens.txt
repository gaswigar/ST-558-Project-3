eurie
mitchell
shut
the
door
with
a
bang
and
ran
up
the
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
she
nearly
always
banged
doors
and
was
always
in
a
hurry
she
tapped
firmly
at
the
door
just
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
then
she
pushed
it
open
and
entered
are
you
going
she
said
and
her
face
was
all
in
a
glow
of
excitement
and
pleasure
the
young
lady
to
whom
she
spoke
measured
the
velvet
to
see
if
it
was
long
enough
for
the
hat
she
was
binding
raised
her
eyes
for
just
an
instant
to
the
eager
face
before
her
and
said
ruth
erskine
what
are
you
trimming
your
hat
for
did
it
suit
say
are
you
going
why
in
the
world
do
you
tell
me
i
have
been
half
wild
all
the
morning
ruth
erskine
smiled
which
question
shall
i
answer
first
what
a
perfect
interrogation
point
you
are
eurie
my
hats
never
suit
you
know
this
one
was
worse
than
usual
this
velvet
is
a
pretty
shade
is
it
am
i
going
to
chautauqua
do
you
mean
i
am
sure
i
do
know
i
have
thought
much
about
it
do
you
really
suppose
it
will
be
worth
while
eurie
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
how
provoking
you
are
thought
of
it
and
here
i
have
been
talking
and
coaxing
all
the
morning
father
thinks
it
is
a
wild
scheme
of
course
and
sees
no
sense
in
spending
so
much
money
but
i
going
for
all
that
i
do
have
a
frolic
once
in
an
age
and
i
have
set
my
heart
on
this
just
think
of
living
in
the
woods
for
two
whole
weeks
camping
out
and
doing
all
sorts
of
wild
things
i
just
delighted
miss
erskine
sewed
thoughtfully
for
some
seconds
then
she
said
why
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
to
hinder
my
going
if
i
want
to
as
to
the
money
i
suppose
one
could
hardly
spend
as
much
there
as
at
long
branch
or
saratoga
and
of
course
i
should
go
somewhere
but
the
point
is
what
do
i
want
to
go
for
why
just
to
be
together
and
be
in
the
woods
and
live
in
a
tent
and
do
nothing
civilized
for
a
fortnight
it
is
the
nicest
idea
that
ever
was
and
should
we
go
to
the
meetings
miss
erskine
asked
still
speaking
thoughtfully
and
as
if
she
were
undecided
why
yes
of
course
now
and
then
though
for
that
matter
i
suppose
father
is
right
enough
when
he
says
that
precious
few
people
go
for
the
sake
of
the
meetings
he
says
it
is
a
grand
jollification
with
a
bit
of
religion
for
the
background
but
for
that
matter
the
less
religion
they
have
the
better
and
so
i
told
him
at
this
point
there
was
a
faint
little
knock
at
the
door
and
eurie
sprang
to
open
it
saying
as
she
went
that
is
flossy
i
know
she
always
gives
just
such
little
pussy
knocks
as
that
the
little
lady
who
entered
fitted
her
name
perfectly
she
was
small
and
fair
flossy
yellow
curls
lying
on
her
shoulders
her
voice
was
small
and
sweet
almost
too
sweet
or
too
soft
that
sort
of
voice
that
could
change
when
slight
occasion
offered
into
a
whine
or
positive
tearfulness
she
was
greeted
with
great
glee
by
eurie
and
in
her
more
quiet
way
by
miss
erskine
going
she
said
with
a
soft
little
laugh
and
she
sank
down
among
the
cushions
of
the
sofa
while
her
white
morning
dress
floated
around
her
like
a
cloud
charlie
thinks
it
is
silly
and
kit
thinks
it
is
sillier
and
mamma
thinks
it
is
the
very
silliest
thing
i
ever
did
yet
but
for
all
that
i
am
going
that
is
if
the
rest
of
you
are
which
by
the
way
was
always
this
little
flossy
manner
of
speech
she
was
going
to
do
or
not
to
do
speak
or
keep
silent
approve
or
condemn
exactly
as
the
mind
which
was
for
the
time
being
nearest
to
her
chose
to
sway
her
good
said
eurie
softly
clapping
her
hands
i
did
think
it
of
you
flossy
i
thought
you
were
too
much
of
a
mouse
now
ruth
you
will
go
wo
you
as
for
marion
there
is
no
knowing
whether
she
will
go
or
not
i
do
see
now
she
can
afford
it
myself
any
more
than
i
can
but
of
course
that
is
her
own
concern
we
can
go
anyway
whether
she
does
or
not
only
i
do
want
to
i
want
her
along
suppose
we
all
go
down
and
see
her
it
is
saturday
she
will
be
at
home
and
then
we
can
begin
to
make
our
preparations
it
is
really
quite
time
we
were
sure
of
what
we
are
going
to
do
by
dint
of
much
coaxing
and
argument
ruth
was
prevailed
upon
to
leave
her
fascinating
brown
hat
with
its
brown
velvet
trimmings
and
in
the
course
of
the
next
half
hour
the
trio
were
on
their
way
down
park
street
intent
on
a
call
on
miss
marion
wilbur
park
street
was
a
simple
quiet
unpretending
street
narrow
and
short
the
houses
were
and
severely
plain
in
one
of
the
plainest
of
these
wearing
an
unmistakable
look
in
a
back
room
on
the
second
floor
the
object
of
their
search
in
a
dark
calico
dress
with
her
sleeves
rolled
above
her
elbows
had
her
hands
immersed
in
a
of
suds
and
was
doing
up
linen
collars
she
was
one
of
those
miserable
creatures
in
this
weary
world
a
teacher
in
a
graded
school
and
her
one
day
of
rest
was
filled
with
all
sorts
of
washing
ironing
and
mending
work
until
she
had
fairly
come
to
groan
over
the
prospect
of
saturday
because
of
the
burden
of
work
which
it
brought
she
welcomed
her
callers
without
taking
her
hands
from
the
suds
she
was
as
quiet
in
her
way
as
ruth
erskine
was
in
hers
this
time
it
was
flossy
who
asked
the
important
question
are
you
going
marion
answered
as
promptly
as
though
the
question
had
been
decided
for
a
week
yes
certainly
i
am
going
i
thought
i
told
you
that
when
we
talked
it
over
before
i
am
washing
out
my
collars
to
have
them
ready
ruth
are
you
going
to
take
a
trunk
ruth
roused
herself
from
the
contemplation
of
her
brown
gloves
to
say
with
a
little
start
how
you
girls
do
rush
things
why
i
have
decided
yet
that
i
am
going
oh
you
go
marion
wilbur
said
the
question
is
are
we
to
take
trunks
or
rather
are
you
to
because
i
know
shall
not
i
going
to
wear
my
black
suit
put
it
on
on
tuesday
morning
or
monday
is
it
that
we
start
and
wear
it
until
we
return
i
may
take
it
off
to
be
sure
while
i
sleep
but
even
that
is
uncertain
as
we
may
not
get
a
place
to
sleep
in
but
for
once
in
my
life
i
am
not
going
to
be
bored
with
baggage
i
shall
take
mine
ruth
erskine
said
with
determination
i
intend
to
be
bored
by
being
without
baggage
it
is
horrid
i
think
to
go
away
with
only
one
dress
and
feel
obliged
to
wear
it
whether
it
is
suited
to
the
weather
or
not
or
whatever
happens
to
it
eurie
what
are
you
laughing
at
i
am
interested
in
the
phenomena
of
marion
wilbur
being
the
first
to
introduce
the
dress
question
i
venture
to
say
not
one
of
us
has
thought
of
that
phase
of
the
matter
up
to
this
present
moment
while
the
talk
went
on
the
collars
and
cuffs
were
carefully
washed
and
rinsed
and
presently
marion
with
her
hands
only
a
trifle
pinker
for
the
operation
was
ready
to
lean
against
a
chair
and
discuss
ways
and
means
her
long
apprenticeship
in
had
given
her
the
habit
of
standing
instead
of
sitting
even
when
there
was
no
occasion
for
the
former
if
these
four
young
ladies
had
been
creatures
of
the
brain
gotten
up
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
illustrating
extremes
of
character
instead
of
being
flesh
and
blood
creations
i
doubt
whether
they
could
have
better
illustrated
the
different
types
of
young
ladyhood
there
was
ruth
erskine
dwelling
in
solitary
grandeur
in
her
royal
home
as
american
royalty
goes
the
sole
daughter
the
sole
child
indeed
of
the
house
a
girl
who
had
no
idea
of
life
except
as
a
place
in
which
to
have
a
serenely
good
time
and
teach
everybody
to
do
as
she
desired
them
to
money
was
a
commonplace
article
neither
to
be
particularly
prized
nor
despised
it
was
convenient
of
course
and
must
be
an
annoyance
when
one
had
to
do
without
it
but
of
that
by
practical
experience
she
knew
nothing
yet
ruth
was
by
no
means
a
girl
without
character
on
the
contrary
she
had
plenty
of
character
but
hitherto
it
had
been
frittered
away
on
nothings
until
it
looked
as
much
like
nothing
as
it
could
she
was
the
sort
of
person
whom
education
and
circumstances
of
the
right
sort
would
have
developed
into
splendor
but
the
development
had
not
taken
place
now
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
she
was
uneducated
that
would
be
a
libel
on
madame
la
fonte
and
her
fashionable
seminary
she
had
graduated
with
honor
taken
the
first
prizes
in
everything
she
knew
all
about
seminaries
so
do
i
and
if
you
do
you
are
ready
to
admit
that
the
development
had
not
come
there
is
constantly
occurring
something
to
take
back
while
i
write
i
have
in
mind
an
institution
where
the
earnest
desire
sought
after
and
prayed
for
is
the
higher
development
not
alone
of
the
intellect
but
of
the
heart
where
the
wonderful
woman
who
is
at
its
head
said
to
me
a
few
years
ago
if
a
lady
has
spent
three
years
under
my
care
and
graduated
and
gone
out
from
me
not
a
christian
i
feel
like
going
down
on
my
knees
in
bitterness
of
soul
and
crying
i
have
failed
in
the
trust
thou
didst
give
me
but
the
very
fact
that
the
word
wonderful
fits
that
woman
name
is
proof
enough
that
such
institutions
as
hers
are
rare
and
it
was
not
at
that
seminary
that
ruth
erskine
graduated
she
was
spending
her
life
in
elegant
pursuits
that
meant
nothing
those
of
them
which
did
not
mean
worse
than
nothing
and
the
only
difference
between
her
and
a
hundred
others
around
her
was
that
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
they
all
amounted
to
nothing
and
did
hesitate
to
say
so
therefore
she
earned
the
title
of
queer
at
the
same
time
she
did
not
hesitate
to
lead
the
whirl
around
this
continuous
nothing
therefore
she
occupied
that
perilous
position
of
being
liked
and
admired
and
envied
all
in
one
very
few
people
loved
her
and
queerly
enough
she
knew
that
too
and
instead
of
resenting
it
realized
that
she
could
not
see
why
they
should
she
was
moreover
remarkably
careful
as
to
her
leading
after
all
and
those
who
followed
were
sure
of
being
led
in
an
eminently
respectable
and
fashionable
way
her
most
intimate
friend
was
eurie
mitchell
which
was
not
strange
when
one
considered
what
remarkable
opposites
in
character
they
were
eureka
mitchell
was
the
respectable
sounding
name
that
the
young
lady
bore
but
the
full
name
would
have
sounded
utterly
strange
to
her
ears
the
wild
little
word
eurie
seeming
to
have
been
made
on
purpose
for
her
she
was
the
eldest
daughter
of
a
large
family
they
never
knew
just
where
they
belonged
they
went
to
the
first
church
which
for
itself
should
have
settled
their
position
since
it
was
the
opinion
of
most
of
its
members
that
it
was
organized
especially
that
the
first
families
might
have
a
but
they
occupied
a
very
front
seat
by
reason
of
their
inability
to
pay
for
a
middle
one
which
was
bad
for
position
as
first
church
gentility
went
what
was
surprising
to
them
was
how
they
ever
happened
to
have
the
money
to
pay
for
that
seat
but
let
me
record
it
to
their
honor
they
always
happened
to
have
it
they
were
honest
they
ought
to
have
been
called
the
happen
family
by
reason
of
their
inability
to
tell
how
much
or
how
little
they
might
happen
to
have
to
live
on
whether
they
could
afford
three
new
dresses
apiece
or
none
at
all
the
fact
being
that
it
depended
on
the
amount
of
sickness
there
was
in
mitchell
beat
whether
there
were
to
be
luxuries
or
simple
bare
necessities
with
some
wonderment
as
to
how
even
those
were
to
be
paid
eurie
was
the
most
and
indifferent
of
this
family
who
always
had
roast
turkey
when
it
was
to
be
had
and
who
could
laugh
and
chat
merrily
over
meat
and
or
even
no
meat
at
all
when
such
days
came
how
she
ever
came
to
think
that
she
could
go
to
chautauqua
was
a
matter
of
surprise
to
herself
but
it
happened
to
have
been
a
sickly
summer
among
the
wealthy
people
and
large
bills
had
come
in
the
next
thing
was
to
spend
them
chautauqua
was
a
silly
place
to
do
it
in
to
be
sure
that
was
mitchell
idea
and
the
family
laughed
together
over
eurie
last
wild
notion
but
for
all
that
they
prepared
to
let
her
carry
it
out
just
how
full
of
fun
and
mischief
and
actual
wildness
eurie
was
a
sojourn
at
chautauqua
will
be
likely
to
develop
for
before
that
conversation
at
marion
was
concluded
they
decided
that
they
were
really
going
why
marion
went
puzzled
the
girls
very
much
puzzled
herself
somewhat
she
was
her
own
mistress
had
neither
father
to
direct
nor
sister
to
consult
she
had
an
uncle
and
aunt
who
lived
where
she
called
home
and
with
whom
she
spent
her
vacations
but
they
were
the
poorest
of
country
people
who
stood
in
awe
of
marion
and
her
education
and
by
no
means
ventured
to
interfere
with
her
plans
marion
was
as
independent
in
her
way
as
ruth
was
in
hers
but
they
were
very
different
ways
ruth
for
instance
indulged
her
independence
in
the
matter
of
dress
by
spending
a
small
fortune
in
looking
elegantly
unlike
everybody
else
and
straightway
created
a
frantic
desire
in
her
set
to
look
as
nearly
like
her
as
possible
but
no
one
cared
to
look
like
marion
in
her
severely
plain
black
or
brown
suits
with
almost
and
sometimes
quite
no
trimmings
at
all
on
them
it
was
agreed
that
she
looked
remarkably
well
but
so
unlike
any
one
else
they
did
see
how
she
could
bring
herself
to
dressing
so
she
laughed
when
this
was
hinted
to
her
and
got
what
comfort
she
could
out
of
the
fact
that
she
was
considered
odd
in
a
certain
way
she
ruled
them
all
ruth
erskine
included
though
that
young
lady
never
suspected
it
the
queerest
one
of
this
company
was
little
flossy
shipley
queer
to
be
found
in
just
such
company
i
mean
she
was
the
petted
darling
of
a
wealthy
home
a
younger
daughter
a
baby
in
their
eyes
to
be
loved
and
cherished
and
allowed
to
have
her
own
sweet
and
precious
way
even
when
it
included
such
a
strange
proceeding
as
a
two
weeks
in
the
woods
all
because
that
strange
girl
in
the
ward
school
that
flossy
had
taken
such
an
unaccountable
fancy
for
was
going
this
family
were
first
church
people
too
and
capable
of
buying
a
seat
very
near
the
centre
in
fact
but
a
few
removes
from
the
erskine
pew
which
was
of
course
the
wealthy
one
of
the
church
the
shipley
pew
was
rarely
honored
by
all
the
members
of
the
family
and
indeed
the
pastor
had
no
special
cause
for
alarm
if
several
sundays
went
by
without
an
appearance
from
one
of
them
a
variety
of
trifles
might
happen
to
cause
such
a
state
of
things
from
which
you
will
infer
that
they
were
not
a
family
another
strange
representative
for
chautauqua
now
how
did
those
four
girls
come
to
be
friends
oh
dreadful
you
expect
me
to
be
able
to
account
for
human
friendships
i
hope
especially
for
friendships
there
is
no
known
rule
that
will
apply
to
such
idiosyncracies
they
had
been
in
school
together
even
marion
wilbur
with
the
indomitable
energy
which
characterized
her
had
managed
one
term
of
madame
la
fonte
enormous
bills
and
with
the
close
of
the
term
found
herself
strangely
enough
drawn
into
this
strange
medley
of
character
that
moved
in
such
different
circles
and
yet
called
themselves
friends
you
are
to
understand
that
though
the
same
church
received
these
girls
on
sunday
yet
the
actual
circle
in
which
their
lives
whirled
was
as
unlike
as
possible
the
erskines
were
the
cream
cultured
traveled
wealthy
aristocratic
as
to
blood
and
as
to
manners
literary
in
the
sense
that
they
bought
rare
books
and
knew
why
they
were
rare
the
mitchells
had
a
calling
acquaintance
with
their
family
because
mitchell
was
their
chosen
physician
but
that
came
to
pass
through
an
accident
and
not
many
of
the
doctor
patrons
were
of
just
the
same
stamp
this
family
never
went
to
the
erskine
entertainments
never
were
invited
to
go
to
the
other
entertainments
starting
from
the
same
circle
yet
they
had
their
friends
and
many
of
them
the
shipleys
were
cordial
social
friendly
people
who
bought
many
books
and
pictures
and
were
prominent
in
fairs
and
festivals
and
were
popular
everywhere
but
were
not
after
all
of
the
erskine
stamp
finally
came
marion
alone
no
position
any
where
save
as
she
ruled
in
the
most
difficult
room
in
the
most
difficult
ward
in
the
city
a
worker
known
to
be
such
a
manager
recognized
as
one
who
could
make
incongruous
elements
meet
and
marshal
into
working
order
in
that
capacity
she
found
her
place
even
in
the
first
church
for
they
had
fairs
and
festivals
and
oyster
suppers
and
other
trials
even
in
the
first
church
and
there
was
much
work
to
be
done
and
marion
wilbur
could
work
and
these
four
girls
were
going
to
chautauqua
were
to
start
on
monday
morning
august
chapter
ii
the
question
discussed
rev
dennis
and
rev
harrison
met
just
at
the
corner
of
howard
and
clinton
streets
and
stopped
for
a
chat
dennis
was
pastor
of
the
first
church
and
harrison
was
pastor
of
the
fourth
and
some
of
the
sheep
belonging
to
these
respective
flocks
supposed
the
two
churches
to
be
rivals
but
the
pastors
thereof
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
on
the
contrary
they
were
always
getting
up
excuses
for
coming
in
contact
with
each
other
and
woe
to
the
work
that
was
waiting
for
each
when
they
chanced
to
meet
of
a
morning
on
some
shady
corner
you
are
to
be
represented
i
hear
at
the
coming
assembly
said
harrison
as
they
shook
hands
in
that
hearty
way
which
says
as
plainly
as
words
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
dennis
shrugged
his
shoulders
such
a
representation
he
said
if
the
entire
congregation
had
been
canvassed
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
have
made
more
curious
selections
i
do
wish
we
could
have
some
real
workers
from
the
different
churches
miss
erskine
is
a
member
of
the
church
is
she
none
of
them
are
members
nor
christians
nor
have
they
an
atom
of
interest
in
any
such
matters
they
are
going
for
pure
fun
and
nothing
else
now
perhaps
they
will
happily
disappoint
you
by
coming
back
with
a
wholesome
interest
aroused
in
work
and
will
really
go
into
the
work
for
themselves
i
do
want
them
dennis
said
stoutly
i
would
give
a
dime
for
a
hundred
such
workers
they
are
an
injury
to
the
cause
i
want
workers
who
have
a
personal
vital
sense
of
the
worth
of
souls
and
a
consuming
desire
to
see
them
converted
all
other
teaching
is
aimless
harrison
looked
thoughtful
we
have
many
such
i
am
afraid
he
said
gravely
but
i
agree
with
you
in
thinking
that
they
should
at
least
be
christians
still
i
suppose
that
it
is
not
impossible
that
some
one
of
these
ladies
may
be
converted
not
at
chautauqua
dennis
said
as
one
who
had
looked
into
the
matter
and
knew
all
about
it
i
am
not
entirely
in
sympathy
with
that
meeting
anyway
or
that
is
i
am
and
i
am
not
all
at
once
i
think
it
would
be
a
grand
place
for
you
and
me
i
have
the
least
doubt
but
that
we
would
be
refreshed
bodily
and
mentally
and
for
that
matter
spiritually
if
the
whole
world
were
converted
i
should
vote
for
chautauqua
with
a
loud
voice
but
i
am
more
than
fearful
as
to
the
influence
of
such
meetings
on
the
masses
the
unconverted
world
will
go
there
for
recreation
their
whole
aim
will
be
to
have
a
glorious
frolic
away
from
the
restraints
of
ordinary
they
will
have
no
interest
in
the
meetings
no
sympathy
with
the
central
thought
that
has
drawn
the
workers
together
and
the
tendency
will
be
to
frolic
through
it
all
the
truth
is
there
will
be
such
a
mixing
of
things
that
i
actually
fear
the
effect
will
be
wholesale
demoralization
at
the
same
time
i
am
interested
in
the
idea
and
am
watching
it
with
anxiety
since
i
have
heard
of
the
delegation
from
my
own
church
i
have
been
more
convinced
still
of
the
evil
influences
it
makes
me
gloomy
to
think
of
the
fruitful
field
such
a
place
will
be
for
the
fertile
brain
of
that
little
eurie
mitchell
she
is
too
wild
now
for
civilized
life
the
four
walls
of
the
church
and
the
sacred
associations
connected
with
the
building
serve
to
keep
her
only
half
controlled
when
she
is
actually
attending
sabbath
service
there
will
be
nothing
to
control
her
in
the
woods
and
she
will
lose
what
little
reverence
she
possesses
i
tell
you
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
certain
i
am
that
for
such
people
these
great
religious
jubilees
holding
over
the
sabbath
do
harm
you
put
it
more
gently
than
our
friend
archer
harrison
said
smiling
he
is
in
a
condition
of
absolute
scorn
he
gives
none
of
them
credit
for
honesty
or
genuine
interest
he
says
it
is
a
running
away
from
work
a
regular
shirking
of
what
they
ought
to
be
doing
and
going
off
into
the
woods
to
have
a
good
time
and
by
way
of
gulling
the
public
they
pretend
to
season
it
with
religion
dennis
laughed
that
sounds
precisely
like
him
and
is
quite
as
logical
as
one
could
expect
coming
from
that
source
he
said
indifferently
why
it
occur
to
his
dull
brain
that
thinks
itself
such
a
sharp
one
that
the
leaders
thereof
are
men
responsible
to
no
one
save
god
and
their
own
consciences
for
the
way
in
which
they
spend
their
time
there
is
nothing
earthly
to
hinder
their
going
to
the
woods
and
staying
three
months
if
they
please
to
do
so
oh
but
i
have
left
out
one
of
the
important
reasons
for
the
meeting
it
is
to
make
money
a
grand
speculation
whereby
the
fortunes
of
these
same
leaders
are
to
be
made
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
victims
whom
they
gather
about
them
again
dennis
shoulders
went
upward
in
that
peculiar
but
expressive
shrug
of
all
the
precarious
and
dangerous
ways
of
making
a
fortune
i
should
think
that
went
ahead
he
said
still
laughing
what
an
idea
now
should
you
suppose
people
with
common
sense
would
have
some
faint
idea
of
the
immense
expenses
to
be
involved
in
such
an
undertaking
and
the
tremendous
risks
to
be
run
if
they
succeed
in
meeting
their
expenses
this
year
i
think
they
will
have
cause
for
rejoicing
the
point
that
puzzles
me
harrison
said
is
what
particular
commandment
would
they
be
breaking
if
they
should
actually
happen
to
have
cents
to
put
in
their
pockets
when
the
meeting
closed
though
as
you
say
i
doubt
the
probability
but
they
force
no
one
to
come
it
is
a
matter
for
individual
decision
and
they
render
a
fair
equivalent
for
every
cent
of
money
spent
at
least
if
the
spender
thinks
it
is
not
a
fair
equivalent
he
is
foolish
to
go
so
why
should
they
not
make
enough
to
justify
them
in
giving
their
time
to
this
work
of
course
of
course
assented
dennis
heartily
they
ought
to
none
but
an
idiot
would
think
otherwise
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
both
these
gentlemen
had
gotten
so
far
away
from
the
name
that
was
quoted
as
holding
these
views
as
to
forget
all
about
him
else
they
certainly
would
not
have
been
guilty
of
calling
a
brother
minister
an
idiot
however
much
his
arguments
might
suggest
the
thought
but
continued
dennis
my
trouble
lies
as
i
said
in
the
results
i
have
no
sort
of
doubt
that
great
good
will
be
done
and
i
have
the
same
feeling
of
certainty
that
harm
will
be
done
take
it
in
my
own
church
we
are
so
situated
or
we
think
ourselves
so
situated
that
not
a
single
one
of
the
earnest
hearty
workers
who
would
come
back
to
us
with
a
blessing
for
themselves
and
us
is
able
to
go
instead
we
have
four
representatives
who
will
turn
the
whole
thing
into
ridicule
and
dish
it
up
for
the
entertainment
of
their
friends
during
the
coming
winter
that
miss
erskine
seems
to
have
a
special
talent
for
getting
up
thursday
evening
entertainments
to
invite
our
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
interested
in
the
but
who
rarely
fail
to
make
it
convenient
to
go
to
the
party
i
imagine
a
bevy
of
them
being
entertained
by
eurie
mitchell
she
can
do
it
and
she
is
looking
forward
to
just
that
sort
of
thing
for
i
heard
her
rejoicing
over
it
that
girl
will
be
injured
by
chautauqua
i
know
it
as
well
as
though
i
already
saw
it
and
the
question
with
me
is
whether
the
amount
of
evil
done
will
not
overbalance
the
good
at
the
same
time
i
am
inconsistent
enough
to
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
could
be
there
what
about
miss
shipley
perhaps
relief
will
come
to
you
from
that
quarter
those
shoulders
again
she
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
little
pink
feather
and
she
blows
precisely
in
the
direction
of
the
strongest
current
and
satan
looks
out
for
her
with
untiring
patience
that
the
wind
shall
blow
in
the
exact
direction
where
it
can
do
her
the
most
harm
going
to
chautauqua
with
the
influences
that
will
surround
her
with
miss
erskine
and
miss
wilbur
on
the
one
side
and
eurie
mitchell
on
the
other
will
be
the
very
best
thing
that
satan
can
do
next
for
her
and
he
doubtless
knows
it
i
do
not
know
miss
wilbur
at
all
is
she
also
one
of
your
flock
dennis
face
was
dark
and
sad
she
is
an
infidel
he
said
decidedly
she
does
not
call
herself
such
she
would
like
to
be
known
as
such
because
it
would
be
likely
to
affect
her
position
in
the
school
but
the
name
is
rightly
hers
and
she
would
do
less
harm
in
the
world
if
she
owned
it
it
is
an
extraordinary
representation
i
declare
harrison
said
a
little
startled
i
have
been
half
inclined
to
be
envious
of
you
because
you
were
to
hear
so
directly
from
the
meeting
but
i
believe
on
the
whole
i
shall
be
quite
as
well
off
without
any
delegates
as
you
will
with
them
better
decidedly
i
am
distressed
at
the
whole
thing
it
will
result
disastrously
for
them
all
you
mark
my
words
and
having
settled
the
affairs
at
chautauqua
apparently
beyond
all
repeal
the
brethren
shook
hands
again
and
went
to
their
studies
meantime
the
express
train
was
giving
occasional
premonitory
snorts
and
the
four
young
ladies
who
had
been
so
thoroughly
discussed
were
in
various
stages
of
unrest
waiting
for
the
moment
of
departure
a
would
have
been
able
to
come
to
marked
conclusions
concerning
the
different
characters
of
these
young
ladies
simply
from
their
manner
of
dress
flossy
shipley
was
the
one
to
look
at
first
that
was
a
very
good
description
of
her
usual
style
something
to
look
at
she
had
chosen
for
her
traveling
dress
a
pale
lavender
cashmere
of
that
delightful
shade
that
resents
a
drop
of
water
as
promptly
as
a
drop
of
oil
it
was
trimmed
with
a
contrasting
shade
of
silk
and
trimmed
profusely
yards
of
gathered
trimming
headed
by
yards
of
flat
pleating
and
that
in
turn
headed
by
yards
of
folds
the
dainty
sack
and
hat
and
the
gloves
were
as
faultless
as
to
fit
and
as
delicate
in
color
as
the
dress
in
short
miss
flossy
looked
as
though
she
might
be
ready
for
an
evening
concert
moreover
she
felt
as
if
she
were
or
at
least
she
had
an
uncomfortable
consciousness
as
to
clothes
she
kept
a
nervous
lookout
for
the
lower
flounce
whenever
the
crowd
of
people
surged
her
way
and
brushed
vigorously
at
the
arm
of
the
seat
she
had
chosen
ere
she
dared
to
rest
arm
on
it
evidently
she
had
given
herself
over
to
the
martyrdom
of
thinking
of
and
caring
for
clothes
during
this
journey
and
i
do
know
whether
there
is
a
greater
martyrdom
made
out
of
a
trifle
than
that
it
was
one
of
besetting
sins
this
arraying
herself
in
glory
and
making
wrinkles
in
her
face
in
the
vain
attempt
to
keep
so
not
that
she
was
particularly
anxious
to
save
the
wear
and
tear
only
she
hated
to
look
spotted
and
wrinkled
and
she
could
never
seem
to
learn
the
simple
lesson
of
wearing
the
things
best
suited
to
the
occasion
standing
near
her
toying
carelessly
with
her
traveling
fan
and
looking
as
though
the
thought
of
dress
was
something
that
had
passed
utterly
by
her
was
miss
erskine
she
looked
like
one
of
those
ladies
whom
gentlemen
in
their
wisdom
are
always
selecting
pointing
them
out
as
models
so
tasteful
and
appropriate
and
withal
so
simple
in
their
dress
let
me
tell
you
about
her
dress
it
was
plain
dark
brown
precisely
the
shade
of
brown
that
the
fashion
of
the
season
required
it
was
of
soft
lusterless
silk
it
was
very
simply
made
almost
severely
plain
as
miss
erskine
knew
became
a
traveler
in
fact
elegant
simplicity
marked
her
entire
toilet
everything
matched
everything
was
fresh
and
spotless
and
arranged
with
an
eye
to
remaining
so
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
she
was
faultlessly
dressed
and
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
see
her
thus
but
i
am
also
anxious
to
have
the
gentlemen
understand
that
that
same
simple
attire
represented
more
money
than
two
wardrobes
like
flossy
shipley
it
is
often
so
with
those
delightfully
plain
and
simple
dresses
that
attract
so
many
people
in
fact
it
might
as
well
be
admitted
since
we
are
on
that
subject
that
elegant
simplicity
is
sometimes
a
very
expensive
article
eurie
mitchell
was
neither
particularly
elegant
nor
noted
for
simplicity
yet
her
dress
was
not
without
character
we
see
enough
of
that
sort
to
become
familiar
with
what
it
means
its
language
is
simply
a
straightened
purse
necessitating
the
putting
together
of
shades
that
do
not
quite
harmonize
and
trimming
in
a
way
that
will
cover
the
most
spots
and
take
the
least
material
that
was
eurie
dress
skirt
of
one
kind
and
overdress
of
another
a
very
economical
fashion
and
one
not
destined
to
last
long
because
of
its
economy
and
the
fact
that
very
elegant
ladies
rather
curl
their
lips
at
it
and
call
it
the
patchwork
style
eurie
from
necessity
rather
than
choice
adopted
it
and
it
was
also
her
misfortune
rather
than
her
taste
that
the
colors
were
too
light
to
be
really
according
to
the
mode
her
gloves
were
of
an
entirely
different
shade
from
the
rest
of
the
attire
and
were
mended
with
a
shade
of
silk
that
did
not
quite
match
altogether
eurie
dress
did
not
suit
miss
erskine
but
for
that
matter
neither
did
it
suit
herself
with
this
difference
that
it
was
after
all
a
matter
of
minor
importance
to
her
miss
wilbur
dress
can
be
disposed
of
in
a
single
sentence
it
was
a
black
alpaca
skirt
not
too
long
and
severely
plain
covered
to
within
three
inches
with
a
plain
brown
linen
polonaise
her
black
hat
with
a
band
of
velvet
about
it
fastened
by
a
single
heavy
knot
and
her
somewhat
worn
black
gloves
completed
her
toilet
and
she
looked
every
inch
a
lady
the
very
people
who
would
have
curled
their
aristocratic
lips
at
eurie
attempt
at
style
turned
and
gave
miss
wilbur
a
second
thoughtful
respectful
look
there
was
a
wayne
who
deserves
attention
he
possessed
himself
of
miss
erskine
fan
and
played
with
it
carelessly
while
he
said
you
are
a
queer
set
what
are
you
all
going
off
there
for
to
bury
yourselves
in
the
woods
i
do
believe
one
of
you
has
an
idea
what
you
are
about
and
it
is
the
very
height
of
the
season
too
that
is
the
trouble
miss
erskine
said
with
a
little
toss
of
her
handsome
head
we
are
sick
of
the
season
and
want
to
get
away
from
it
i
want
something
new
that
is
precisely
what
i
am
going
for
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
find
it
and
the
gentleman
gave
a
disdainful
shrug
to
his
shoulders
out
in
the
backwoods
attending
a
hallelujah
meeting
i
am
sure
i
envy
you
you
do
know
what
we
will
find
eurie
mitchell
said
with
a
defiant
air
nor
what
may
happen
to
us
before
we
return
we
may
meet
our
destinies
i
have
no
doubt
they
are
lurking
for
us
behind
some
of
the
trees
just
you
meet
the
evening
train
of
wednesday
two
weeks
hence
and
see
if
you
can
not
discover
the
finger
of
fate
having
been
busy
with
us
wonderful
things
can
happen
in
two
weeks
just
then
the
train
gave
its
last
warning
howl
and
wayne
made
rapid
a
trifle
more
lingering
in
the
case
of
miss
erskine
than
the
others
and
with
that
prophetic
sentence
still
ringing
in
his
ears
he
departed
and
the
four
girls
were
actually
for
chautauqua
chapter
iii
entering
the
current
it
is
a
queer
thought
not
to
say
a
startling
one
what
very
trifles
about
us
are
constantly
giving
object
lessons
on
our
characters
those
four
girls
as
they
arranged
themselves
in
the
cars
for
their
journey
conveyed
four
different
impressions
to
the
critical
in
the
first
place
they
each
selected
and
took
possession
of
an
entire
seat
though
the
cars
were
filling
rapidly
and
many
an
anxious
woman
and
heavily
laden
man
looked
reproachfully
at
them
they
took
these
whole
seats
from
entirely
different
miss
erskine
because
she
was
a
finished
and
selfish
traveler
and
although
she
did
not
belong
to
that
absolutely
unendurable
class
who
occupy
room
that
is
not
theirs
until
a
conductor
interferes
she
yet
regularly
appropriated
and
kept
the
extra
seat
engaged
with
her
flounces
until
she
was
asked
outright
to
vacate
it
by
one
more
determined
than
the
rest
she
hated
company
and
avoided
it
when
possible
flossy
shipley
was
willing
nay
ready
to
give
up
her
extra
seat
the
moment
a
person
of
the
right
sort
appeared
not
simply
a
cleanly
respectable
individual
they
might
pass
by
the
dozens
but
one
who
attracted
her
who
was
elegantly
dressed
and
stylish
looking
flossy
would
endure
being
crowded
if
only
the
person
who
did
it
was
stylish
miss
wilbur
was
indifferent
to
the
whole
race
of
human
beings
she
cared
as
little
as
possible
whether
a
lady
stood
or
sat
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
they
were
apt
to
do
the
former
she
neither
frowned
nor
smiled
when
the
time
came
that
she
was
obliged
to
move
she
simply
with
as
unconcerned
and
indifferent
a
face
as
she
had
worn
all
the
due
as
for
eurie
mitchell
she
took
an
entire
seat
as
she
did
most
other
things
from
pure
heedlessness
any
one
was
welcome
who
wanted
to
sit
with
her
and
whether
it
was
a
servant
girl
or
a
princess
was
a
matter
of
no
moment
these
various
shades
of
feeling
were
nearly
as
fully
expressed
in
their
faces
as
though
they
had
spoken
and
yet
they
did
not
in
the
least
comprehend
their
own
actions
this
is
only
an
illustration
it
was
so
in
a
hundred
little
nothings
during
the
day
not
a
window
was
raised
or
closed
for
their
benefit
not
a
turn
of
a
blind
made
that
a
close
student
of
human
nature
could
not
have
seen
the
distinct
and
ruling
differences
in
their
temperaments
no
matter
from
what
point
of
the
compass
they
started
in
the
course
of
time
they
reached
east
buffalo
now
for
our
dinners
eurie
said
as
the
whistle
shrieked
a
warning
that
the
station
was
being
neared
what
are
we
going
to
do
we
are
going
to
eat
them
i
presume
as
usual
miss
erskine
said
in
her
most
indifferent
tone
i
should
explain
that
long
before
this
the
girls
had
grown
weary
of
the
separate
seats
and
by
dint
of
much
planning
and
the
removal
of
two
fellow
passengers
to
other
seats
had
accomplished
an
arrangement
that
should
naturally
have
been
enjoyed
from
the
beginning
that
of
a
turned
seat
and
being
their
own
but
i
mean
eurie
said
in
no
wise
quenched
by
what
was
a
common
enough
manner
in
miss
erskine
are
we
to
get
a
lunch
or
are
we
to
go
in
to
a
regular
dinner
if
you
mean
what
i
am
going
to
do
i
shall
most
assuredly
have
a
dinner
as
you
call
it
i
have
no
fancy
for
eating
things
thrown
together
in
a
bag
the
bag
will
be
the
most
economical
process
for
all
that
eurie
said
laughing
at
miss
erskine
disdainful
face
i
presume
very
likely
but
as
i
did
not
start
on
this
trip
for
the
purpose
of
studying
social
economy
i
shall
vote
for
the
dinner
and
i
shall
take
to
the
bag
method
eurie
said
decidedly
opposition
always
decided
her
so
it
did
flossy
though
in
a
different
way
she
was
sure
to
side
with
the
stronger
party
it
would
be
pleasanter
for
us
all
to
keep
together
she
began
in
a
doubtful
tone
looking
first
at
miss
erskine
and
then
at
eurie
but
since
according
to
eurie
and
my
decided
differences
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
do
the
thing
which
of
the
two
things
are
you
going
to
do
this
miss
erskine
said
with
utmost
good
nature
but
with
utmost
determination
as
much
as
it
would
have
taken
to
carry
out
a
good
idea
in
the
face
of
opposition
oh
i
think
i
go
with
you
flossy
said
it
hastily
as
if
she
feared
that
she
might
appear
foolish
in
the
eyes
of
this
young
lady
by
having
fancied
anything
else
very
well
then
it
remains
for
marion
to
choose
her
company
eurie
said
composedly
marion
held
up
a
paper
bundle
it
is
already
chosen
she
said
promptly
it
is
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
with
a
very
thin
slice
of
fat
ham
which
i
never
eat
and
a
greasy
doughnut
the
whole
done
up
in
a
brown
paper
this
is
decidedly
an
improvement
on
the
bag
dinner
which
you
think
of
going
after
in
an
economical
point
of
view
and
as
i
am
a
student
of
social
and
all
other
sorts
of
economy
not
only
on
this
trip
but
on
every
other
trip
of
mine
in
this
mortal
life
i
recommend
it
to
you
at
least
i
would
have
done
so
if
you
had
asked
me
this
morning
before
you
left
home
eurie
made
a
grimace
i
might
have
brought
a
splendid
lunch
from
home
if
i
had
only
thought
of
such
a
thing
she
said
regretfully
my
thoughts
always
come
afterward
and
it
is
quite
the
mode
to
take
lunches
with
you
when
they
are
elegantly
put
up
flossy
said
regretfully
as
she
prepared
to
follow
ruth
i
wonder
we
never
thought
of
it
this
last
remark
of
flossy
set
the
two
girls
left
behind
into
a
hearty
laugh
do
you
suppose
that
when
flossy
has
to
die
she
will
be
troubled
lest
it
may
not
be
the
fashion
for
young
ladies
to
die
that
season
eurie
said
looking
after
the
pretty
little
doll
as
she
gathered
her
skirts
about
her
anxiously
for
whatever
other
qualifications
east
buffalo
may
have
cleanliness
is
not
one
of
them
no
marion
answered
gravely
not
the
least
danger
of
it
because
it
happens
to
be
the
fashion
for
ladies
to
die
at
all
seasons
it
is
the
one
thing
that
never
seems
to
go
out
i
am
heartily
glad
that
we
have
one
thing
that
remains
absolute
in
this
fashionable
world
eurie
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
marion
one
would
think
you
were
religious
sometimes
she
said
gravely
you
make
such
strange
remarks
marion
laughed
immoderately
you
ridiculous
little
infidel
she
said
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
you
do
not
even
know
enough
about
religion
to
detect
the
difference
between
goodness
and
wickedness
why
that
was
one
of
my
wickedest
remarks
and
here
you
are
mistaking
it
for
goodness
my
dear
child
run
and
get
your
paper
bag
before
it
is
time
to
go
or
will
you
have
my
slice
of
ham
and
half
this
doughnut
the
bread
and
butter
i
want
myself
the
freshness
and
novelty
of
this
journey
wore
away
before
the
long
summer
afternoon
began
to
wane
the
cars
were
crowded
and
uncomfortable
and
the
cinders
flew
about
in
as
trying
a
way
as
cinders
can
none
of
the
girls
had
the
least
idea
where
they
were
going
they
knew
in
a
general
way
that
there
must
be
such
a
place
as
chautauqua
lake
as
the
papers
that
they
chanced
to
come
in
contact
with
had
been
full
of
the
delights
of
that
region
for
many
months
and
indeed
a
young
man
earnest
enthusiastic
and
sensible
who
stopped
over
night
at
mitchell
and
had
been
a
delighted
guest
at
the
chautauqua
assembly
a
year
before
had
sown
the
first
seeds
that
resulted
in
this
trip
he
of
course
could
tell
the
exact
route
and
the
necessary
steps
to
be
taken
but
it
had
been
no
part
of
eurie
wisdom
to
ask
about
the
journey
thither
she
knew
how
many
boats
were
on
the
lake
and
what
kind
of
fish
could
be
caught
in
it
but
the
most
direct
way
to
reach
it
was
a
minor
matter
so
there
they
were
simply
blundering
along
in
the
belief
that
the
railroad
officials
knew
their
business
and
would
get
them
somewhere
sometime
as
the
day
waned
and
the
road
became
more
unknown
to
them
and
their
weariness
grew
upon
them
they
fell
to
indulging
in
those
stale
jokes
that
young
ladies
will
perpetrate
when
they
do
know
what
else
to
do
as
they
declared
with
much
laughter
and
many
smart
ways
of
saying
it
that
chautauqua
was
a
myth
of
eurie
brain
or
that
she
had
been
the
dupe
of
the
fine
young
theological
student
who
had
chanced
her
way
and
that
the
search
for
paradise
would
come
to
naught
perhaps
it
was
not
all
joking
for
as
the
hours
passed
and
they
journeyed
on
hearing
nothing
about
the
place
of
which
for
the
last
few
weeks
they
had
thought
so
much
a
queer
feeling
began
to
steal
over
them
that
there
really
was
no
such
spot
and
that
they
were
all
a
set
of
idiots
i
thought
we
should
have
been
there
by
this
time
and
regularly
established
at
housekeeping
marion
said
as
they
picked
up
baskets
and
bundles
and
prepared
to
change
cars
and
here
we
are
making
another
change
this
is
the
third
this
afternoon
or
is
it
the
thirteenth
and
who
knows
where
brocton
is
or
what
it
is
is
anybody
sure
that
it
is
in
this
hemisphere
eurie
you
are
certain
that
your
theological
student
did
not
cross
the
atlantic
in
order
to
reach
his
elysium
brocton
is
eurie
said
as
they
climbed
the
steps
of
the
car
i
see
the
name
on
that
building
yonder
though
whether
is
america
or
asia
i
am
unable
to
say
i
think
we
have
come
overland
but
it
is
so
long
since
we
started
i
may
have
forgotten
but
at
this
point
they
checked
their
nonsense
and
began
to
get
up
a
new
interest
in
existence
they
were
among
a
different
class
of
people
earnest
eager
people
who
seemed
to
have
no
thought
of
yawns
or
weariness
abounded
with
here
and
there
a
bundle
looking
like
quilts
and
pillows
every
lady
had
a
waterproof
and
every
man
an
umbrella
and
the
talk
was
of
tents
and
division
meetings
and
the
morning
boats
with
stray
words
like
fairpoint
and
mayville
coming
in
every
now
and
then
these
two
words
the
girls
knew
had
to
do
with
hopes
so
they
began
to
feel
revived
i
actually
begin
to
think
there
is
some
foundation
for
eurie
wild
fancies
after
all
marion
whispered
or
else
this
is
another
party
of
lunatics
as
wild
as
ourselves
but
they
are
a
large
and
respectable
party
i
rather
hopeful
in
two
minutes
more
the
railroad
official
who
speaks
in
the
unknown
tongue
yelped
something
at
either
door
and
thereupon
everybody
got
up
and
began
to
prepare
for
an
exit
do
you
think
he
said
mayville
questioned
eurie
with
a
shade
of
anxiety
in
her
voice
she
had
been
the
leader
of
this
scheme
and
she
felt
just
a
trifle
of
responsibility
have
the
least
idea
marion
said
composedly
gathering
her
wrappings
it
sounded
as
much
like
any
other
word
you
happen
to
think
of
as
it
did
like
that
but
everybody
is
going
and
flossy
and
i
are
determined
to
be
in
the
fashion
so
we
go
too
at
the
door
dismay
seized
upon
flossy
a
light
drizzly
rain
was
falling
oh
the
lavender
suit
and
her
waterproof
tucked
away
in
her
trunk
and
everybody
pushing
and
trying
to
pass
her
never
mind
marion
said
with
utmost
good
nature
here
is
mine
i
have
any
trunk
so
it
is
handy
and
it
has
rained
on
my
old
alpaca
for
ages
ca
hurt
that
so
wrap
yourself
up
and
come
along
for
i
believe
in
my
heart
that
this
is
mayville
this
way
to
the
mayville
house
said
the
gentlemanly
official
touching
his
hat
as
politely
as
though
they
had
been
princesses
why
ca
hotel
subordinates
more
often
show
a
little
common
politeness
this
act
decided
the
location
of
these
four
girls
in
a
twinkling
they
knew
nothing
about
any
of
the
hotels
and
other
things
being
equal
anybody
would
rather
go
to
a
place
to
which
they
had
been
decently
invited
than
to
be
elbowed
and
yelled
at
and
forced
water
and
rest
and
tea
did
much
to
restore
them
to
comfort
and
as
they
discussed
matters
in
their
rooms
afterward
they
assured
each
other
that
the
mayville
house
was
just
the
place
to
stop
at
a
discussion
was
in
progress
as
to
the
evening
meeting
miss
erskine
had
taken
down
her
hair
and
donned
a
becoming
wrapper
and
reposed
serenely
in
the
offering
no
remark
beyond
the
composed
and
decided
i
am
not
going
over
in
the
woods
by
any
manner
of
means
that
would
be
enough
if
i
were
actually
one
of
the
lunatics
instead
of
a
mild
i
have
the
least
idea
of
going
either
eurie
said
sitting
on
a
stool
balancing
her
stockinged
feet
against
ruth
rocker
not
that
i
mind
the
rain
or
that
it
would
be
fun
enough
if
i
were
not
so
dead
tired
but
i
tell
you
girls
i
have
had
to
work
like
a
soldier
to
get
ready
and
having
the
care
of
such
a
set
as
you
have
been
all
day
has
been
too
much
for
me
a
religious
meeting
would
just
finish
me
going
to
save
myself
up
for
morning
you
are
a
goosie
to
go
marion
it
is
as
dark
as
ink
and
is
raining
what
can
you
see
i
tell
you
i
to
go
marion
said
as
she
quietly
unstrapped
her
shawl
i
earn
my
bread
as
you
are
very
well
aware
by
teaching
school
but
my
butter
and
a
few
such
delicacies
i
get
by
writing
up
folks
and
things
i
promised
to
give
a
melting
account
of
this
first
meeting
and
i
have
no
idea
of
losing
the
chance
flossy
shipley
you
may
wear
my
waterproof
every
minute
if
you
will
go
with
me
it
is
long
enough
to
drag
a
quarter
of
a
yard
and
a
rain
drop
can
not
get
near
enough
to
think
of
you
but
it
is
so
damp
shivered
flossy
looking
drearily
out
into
the
night
and
so
dark
marion
i
am
afraid
to
go
plenty
of
people
going
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
we
go
down
from
here
in
a
carriage
i
would
go
flossy
chimed
in
a
voice
from
the
rocker
and
one
from
the
ottoman
it
will
be
very
damp
there
pleaded
flossy
who
like
to
be
accommodating
you
may
have
ten
thicknesses
of
my
shawl
to
sit
on
urged
marion
come
now
flossy
shipley
i
did
have
the
least
idea
of
coaxing
those
other
girls
to
go
for
every
one
knows
they
are
selfish
and
will
do
as
they
please
but
i
did
think
you
would
keep
me
company
it
really
is
pleasant
to
think
of
going
alone
the
end
of
it
was
that
flossy
done
up
in
a
cloak
twice
too
large
for
her
went
off
looking
like
the
martyr
that
she
was
and
eurie
and
ruth
staid
in
their
room
and
laughed
over
the
ridiculousness
of
flossy
shipley
going
out
in
the
night
and
the
rain
in
a
lavender
cashmere
to
attend
a
religious
meeting
chapter
iv
fairpoint
it
was
not
so
very
dark
after
all
nor
so
disagreeable
as
she
had
imagined
she
sat
curled
up
in
a
heap
on
the
deck
of
the
phillips
looking
with
interested
eyes
on
the
groups
of
people
who
despite
the
rain
and
darkness
were
evidently
on
their
way
to
chautauqua
marion
had
gone
to
the
other
side
of
the
boat
and
was
looking
over
into
the
water
rested
and
interested
in
spite
of
herself
by
the
novelty
of
the
scene
around
her
the
seemed
not
to
be
novices
like
themselves
for
as
their
talk
floated
to
the
girls
it
had
sentences
like
these
last
year
we
stopped
in
the
village
but
this
time
we
are
going
to
be
right
on
the
ground
last
year
it
rained
too
but
rain
makes
no
difference
at
chautauqua
they
are
all
last
year
people
said
marion
coming
over
to
side
that
speaks
well
for
the
interest
or
the
fun
does
it
now
what
do
you
suppose
takes
all
these
people
to
this
place
i
do
know
flossy
said
thoughtfully
i
never
thought
much
about
it
perhaps
some
of
them
came
just
as
i
did
because
the
girls
were
coming
and
asked
me
to
i
sure
i
have
the
least
idea
what
else
i
came
for
marion
looked
down
on
the
little
creature
done
up
in
with
a
laugh
you
are
a
good
little
mouse
she
said
patronizingly
i
never
remember
doing
without
a
motive
somewhere
it
must
be
refreshing
to
forget
that
important
individual
now
and
then
oh
i
do
flossy
said
simply
of
course
i
came
for
the
good
time
i
would
have
but
then
you
know
i
would
never
have
thought
of
coming
if
the
rest
of
you
had
another
laugh
from
marion
you
let
others
do
your
thinking
for
you
she
said
with
just
a
touch
of
contempt
covered
by
the
gayety
of
the
tone
well
it
is
much
the
easier
way
if
i
could
find
anyone
to
undertake
the
task
i
should
like
to
try
it
for
myself
flossy
answer
was
a
little
scream
of
delight
for
they
were
coming
upon
the
lights
of
fairpoint
were
gleaming
in
the
soft
distance
and
very
they
looked
shining
among
the
trees
the
sound
of
music
on
the
steamer
mingled
charmingly
with
the
peal
of
the
bells
from
the
shore
marion
looked
on
the
scene
with
quiet
interest
flossy
face
took
a
pink
glow
she
liked
pretty
things
as
for
those
who
had
been
at
chautauqua
the
year
before
they
gathered
at
the
vessel
side
as
those
gather
who
after
a
long
and
tiresome
journey
realize
that
they
are
nearing
home
they
were
eager
and
excited
the
dock
is
better
said
one
yes
and
the
passage
way
is
larger
chimed
in
his
nearest
neighbor
oh
everything
is
on
an
improved
scale
this
year
said
still
a
third
speaking
confidently
the
ca
be
any
better
spoke
a
woman
with
a
decided
voice
that
is
simply
impossible
marion
laughed
softly
hear
the
lunatics
she
said
bending
to
give
flossy
the
benefit
of
her
words
they
are
just
infatuated
they
think
this
is
the
original
garden
of
eden
with
that
wretched
eve
left
out
if
she
were
here
i
would
choke
her
with
a
relish
this
last
in
a
muttered
undertone
too
low
for
even
flossy
and
with
a
darkening
face
meantime
the
boat
rounded
the
point
the
plank
was
laid
and
the
feet
of
the
eager
passengers
touched
the
shores
of
chautauqua
some
detention
about
tickets
arising
from
a
misunderstanding
of
terms
made
our
girls
lose
sight
and
sound
of
the
rest
of
the
and
when
they
passed
within
the
railing
they
found
themselves
suddenly
and
strangely
alone
a
few
lights
glimmered
in
the
trees
enough
to
point
the
way
and
from
the
cottages
near
at
hand
streams
of
light
shot
out
into
the
darkness
but
no
sound
of
footsteps
no
sight
of
human
being
appeared
over
the
river
on
the
hill
another
village
lieth
still
quoted
marion
gravely
then
i
say
flossy
what
does
it
all
mean
are
we
among
a
party
of
witches
do
you
suppose
where
could
those
congenial
spirits
so
suddenly
have
conveyed
themselves
away
i
wonder
the
road
is
broad
but
it
most
decidedly
is
straight
only
behold
that
long
long
array
of
damp
and
empty
seats
where
are
the
faithful
now
do
you
suppose
there
is
any
meeting
here
and
we
might
have
known
there
would
be
flossy
said
peevishly
beginning
to
grow
not
only
disenchanted
but
half
frightened
i
was
never
in
such
a
queer
place
in
my
life
those
white
seats
all
look
like
ghosts
what
could
have
possessed
you
to
come
of
course
they
would
have
meeting
in
the
rain
marion
do
let
us
go
back
i
am
frightened
out
of
my
wits
you
blessed
little
simpleton
said
marion
gaily
what
on
earth
is
there
to
be
frightened
over
not
pine
seats
and
lamplight
surely
and
there
is
nothing
more
formidable
than
that
so
far
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
were
safely
back
in
the
hotel
where
i
would
have
been
if
you
had
not
coaxed
me
away
sighed
or
rather
whined
poor
flossy
shivering
with
chilliness
or
nervousness
and
added
come
marion
do
let
us
go
back
with
that
boat
it
ca
have
started
yet
marion
grasped
her
hand
firmly
and
spoke
like
a
commander
flossy
shipley
do
you
go
to
getting
nervous
and
acting
like
a
simpleton
for
i
wo
have
it
as
for
that
boat
it
is
half
way
to
mayville
by
this
time
and
i
am
glad
of
it
do
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
make
an
ignominious
retreat
now
when
we
have
got
so
far
advanced
not
a
bit
of
it
if
there
is
no
meeting
we
will
go
where
there
ought
to
be
one
since
it
was
advertised
and
not
a
word
said
about
rain
it
likely
they
stay
when
it
actually
pours
very
likely
they
go
in
somewhere
and
have
a
so
now
compose
your
nerves
and
walk
fast
for
if
the
spot
is
within
walking
distance
i
am
going
to
find
it
i
tell
you
i
am
to
get
ten
dollars
at
least
for
writing
up
this
meeting
and
i
am
going
to
write
it
if
there
is
one
to
write
about
if
there
is
i
shall
have
to
make
up
one
i
dare
say
i
could
make
it
interesting
i
put
you
in
if
i
do
and
you
shall
be
mrs
fearful
in
pilgrim
progress
you
know
if
you
do
stop
shivering
and
walk
faster
during
this
time
they
had
really
been
making
as
rapid
progress
as
the
way
and
their
doubt
of
the
road
would
allow
flossy
made
no
reply
to
this
harangue
for
the
reason
that
a
sudden
turn
in
the
path
brought
them
into
bright
light
and
the
sound
of
a
ringing
voice
there
whispered
marion
as
the
mammoth
tent
came
in
view
what
did
i
tell
you
what
do
you
think
of
for
a
and
then
she
too
relapsed
into
silence
for
the
ringing
tones
of
the
voice
were
distinct
and
clear
they
made
their
way
rapidly
and
silently
under
the
tent
down
the
aisle
half
way
down
then
a
gentleman
beckoned
them
and
by
dint
of
some
pushing
and
moving
secured
them
seats
then
both
girls
looked
about
them
in
astonishment
who
would
have
supposed
that
it
rained
why
there
were
rows
and
rows
and
rows
of
heads
men
and
women
and
even
children
a
tent
larger
than
they
had
imagined
could
be
built
and
packed
with
people
marion
tongue
was
uncontrollable
she
was
barely
seated
before
she
began
her
whispered
comments
that
man
who
is
speaking
is
vincent
has
he
a
ringing
voice
it
reminds
me
of
a
trumpet
he
likes
to
use
it
i
know
he
does
he
has
learned
to
manage
it
so
nicely
and
with
an
eye
to
the
effect
you
will
hear
his
voice
often
enough
and
you
just
watch
and
see
if
you
learn
to
know
the
first
echo
of
it
from
any
other
perhaps
he
wo
be
here
all
the
time
to
use
his
voice
whispered
back
flossy
without
much
idea
what
she
was
saying
the
novelty
of
the
scene
had
stolen
her
senses
marion
laughed
softly
you
blessed
little
idiot
she
said
do
you
know
that
he
manufactured
chautauqua
root
and
branch
or
if
he
did
quite
manufacture
the
trees
he
looked
after
their
growth
i
dare
say
why
this
meeting
is
his
darling
his
idol
his
best
beloved
him
speak
i
guess
you
will
i
should
like
to
see
a
meeting
of
this
kind
that
did
hear
from
him
it
will
have
to
be
when
he
is
out
of
the
body
how
do
you
know
about
him
whispered
flossy
struck
with
sudden
curiosity
i
written
him
up
marion
said
briefly
i
had
to
do
it
several
times
oh
i
a
veteran
at
meetings
but
he
is
the
hardest
man
to
write
about
that
there
is
among
them
because
you
can
never
tell
what
he
may
happen
to
say
or
do
next
it
will
never
do
to
jump
at
his
conclusions
and
slip
in
a
neat
little
sentence
of
your
own
as
coming
from
him
if
you
do
happen
to
have
taken
very
profuse
notes
because
as
sure
as
you
do
he
will
spring
up
in
some
tiresome
meeting
in
less
than
a
week
and
unsay
every
single
word
that
you
said
he
said
at
this
point
a
poor
martyr
who
had
the
misery
to
sit
directly
in
front
of
these
two
whisperers
turned
and
gave
them
such
a
look
as
only
a
man
can
under
like
circumstances
and
awed
them
into
five
minutes
of
quiet
it
lasted
until
eggleston
was
announced
then
marion
tongue
broke
loose
again
he
is
the
schoolmaster
do
you
know
we
read
his
book
aloud
at
the
seminary
looks
as
though
he
might
have
written
it
does
he
let
listen
to
what
he
says
he
always
says
a
word
or
two
that
a
body
can
report
very
few
of
them
do
this
is
a
fair
specimen
of
the
way
in
which
miss
wilbur
buzzed
through
that
meeting
that
meeting
that
flossy
shipley
will
remember
all
her
life
she
made
no
answer
to
marion
comments
after
a
little
and
the
pink
flush
glowed
deeper
on
her
face
she
was
wonderfully
interested
indeed
she
was
more
than
interested
there
was
a
strange
feeling
of
pain
at
her
heart
a
sort
of
sick
longing
feeling
that
she
had
never
felt
before
to
understand
what
all
these
people
meant
to
feel
as
they
seemed
to
feel
the
christian
world
is
more
to
blame
for
the
unspoken
infidelity
that
thrives
in
its
circles
than
is
generally
supposed
flossy
shipley
had
been
in
many
religious
meetings
but
she
had
really
never
in
her
life
before
been
among
a
large
gathering
of
cultured
people
who
were
eager
and
excited
and
happy
and
the
cause
for
that
eagerness
and
that
happiness
been
found
in
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
i
do
not
say
that
there
had
never
been
such
meetings
before
nor
that
there
have
not
been
many
of
them
i
simply
say
that
it
was
a
new
revelation
to
flossy
and
she
had
been
to
the
church
at
home
several
times
whether
that
church
may
have
been
peculiar
or
not
i
do
not
say
but
flossy
had
certainly
failed
to
get
the
idea
that
were
blessed
places
that
the
people
who
went
there
from
week
to
week
found
their
joy
and
their
rest
and
their
comfort
there
she
began
to
have
an
unutterable
sense
of
want
and
longing
creeping
over
her
she
stole
shy
glances
at
marion
to
see
if
she
felt
this
but
marion
was
absorbed
just
then
in
catching
the
speaker
last
sentence
and
writing
it
down
her
face
expressed
nothing
but
business
earnestness
concluded
there
came
the
covenant
service
i
wonder
what
that
is
supposed
to
be
whispered
marion
it
sounds
like
something
dreadfully
solemn
i
hope
they
are
not
going
to
have
any
scenes
revivals
are
not
fashionable
except
in
the
winter
marion
flossy
said
in
an
earnest
undertone
the
gay
and
what
for
the
first
time
struck
her
as
the
sacrilegious
words
chilled
her
and
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
uttered
an
unhesitating
remonstrance
something
in
the
tone
surprised
marion
and
she
looked
curiously
down
at
her
little
companion
but
said
not
another
word
the
covenant
service
was
the
simplest
of
all
services
in
fact
only
the
singing
of
a
familiar
hymn
and
the
offering
of
a
prayer
but
the
hymn
was
read
first
in
such
solemn
tender
pleading
tones
as
it
seemed
to
flossy
she
had
never
heard
before
and
the
singing
rolled
around
that
great
tent
like
the
voices
of
the
ten
thousand
who
sing
before
the
throne
at
least
to
flossy
heart
it
seemed
like
that
the
prayer
that
followed
was
the
simplest
of
all
prayers
as
to
words
and
the
briefest
public
prayer
she
ever
remembered
to
have
heard
and
it
made
her
feel
as
nothing
in
life
had
ever
done
before
she
did
not
understand
the
cause
for
her
emotion
she
was
not
acquainted
with
the
spirit
of
god
she
did
not
know
that
he
was
speaking
to
her
softened
heart
and
calling
her
gently
to
himself
so
she
felt
ashamed
of
the
emotion
that
she
could
not
help
she
wiped
the
tears
away
secretly
and
was
glad
that
the
night
was
dark
and
the
need
for
haste
great
for
the
steamer
warning
whistle
could
already
be
beard
marion
talked
on
as
they
went
down
the
hill
not
alone
now
but
accompanied
by
hundreds
talked
precisely
as
she
had
before
the
singing
of
those
words
and
the
prayer
how
could
she
flossy
wondered
how
could
anything
look
the
same
to
her
the
spirit
had
found
no
softened
heart
in
which
to
leave
a
message
and
so
had
passed
by
this
if
flossy
had
known
it
was
the
reason
that
marion
was
gay
and
indifferent
if
either
of
them
had
fully
realized
the
reason
for
the
different
effect
of
the
meeting
upon
them
how
startled
they
would
have
been
it
is
not
strange
after
all
that
a
service
is
not
the
same
to
one
soul
that
it
is
to
another
when
we
remember
that
god
speaks
to
one
and
passes
another
the
night
was
still
heavy
with
clouds
not
a
star
to
lighten
the
gloom
a
fine
mist
was
falling
it
was
marion
who
shivered
this
time
and
said
it
is
a
horrible
night
that
is
a
fact
but
i
am
not
sorry
we
went
that
meeting
will
write
up
splendidly
though
it
was
too
long
i
will
say
that
in
print
about
it
you
must
find
some
fault
you
know
when
you
are
writing
for
the
public
it
is
the
fashion
was
it
long
said
flossy
in
an
absent
tone
she
had
not
thought
of
it
in
that
way
then
she
went
to
the
side
of
the
boat
again
and
sat
down
in
a
tumult
what
was
the
matter
with
her
where
had
her
complacent
pretty
little
content
gone
would
she
feel
so
sad
and
anxious
and
unhappy
have
such
a
longing
as
she
did
now
if
she
had
been
wiser
she
could
have
told
herself
that
the
trouble
of
heart
was
caused
by
an
unhealthy
excitement
upon
this
question
and
that
this
was
the
great
fault
with
religious
meetings
but
she
was
not
wise
she
did
not
think
of
such
a
reason
if
it
had
been
suggested
to
her
it
is
doubtful
if
in
her
ignorance
she
would
not
have
said
why
she
had
been
more
excited
at
an
evening
party
a
hundred
times
than
she
had
thought
of
being
then
she
actually
did
not
know
that
eagerness
and
zeal
are
proper
enough
at
parties
but
utterly
out
of
place
in
religion
just
in
front
of
her
sat
a
young
man
who
hummed
in
undertone
the
closing
words
of
the
covenant
song
it
brought
the
tears
again
to
flossy
eyes
he
turned
suddenly
toward
her
it
was
a
pleasant
service
he
said
do
you
think
so
it
was
rather
startling
to
be
addressed
by
a
strange
young
gentleman
or
would
have
been
it
his
voice
had
not
been
so
quiet
and
dignified
as
if
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
compare
notes
with
one
who
had
just
come
out
from
the
great
meeting
i
do
know
whether
it
was
or
not
she
said
hurriedly
she
could
not
seem
to
decide
whether
she
enjoyed
it
or
hated
it
it
was
blessed
to
me
the
young
man
said
in
quiet
voice
and
added
in
undertone
as
if
speaking
to
himself
only
god
was
there
do
you
feel
that
said
flossy
suddenly
then
i
wonder
that
you
were
not
afraid
he
turned
toward
her
a
pleasant
face
and
said
earnestly
you
would
not
be
afraid
of
your
father
would
you
well
god
is
my
father
my
reconciled
father
and
then
after
a
moment
he
added
it
i
were
not
at
peace
with
him
and
had
reason
to
think
that
he
was
angry
with
me
then
it
would
be
different
then
i
suppose
i
should
be
afraid
at
least
i
think
it
would
be
reasonable
to
be
flossy
spoke
out
of
the
fullness
of
a
troubled
heart
i
do
understand
it
at
all
i
never
wanted
to
either
until
just
but
now
i
want
to
feel
as
those
people
did
when
they
sang
that
hymn
marion
came
quickly
up
from
the
other
side
flossy
she
said
with
sudden
sharpness
come
over
here
and
watch
the
track
of
the
boat
through
the
water
and
as
flossy
mechanically
obeyed
she
added
what
a
foolish
heedless
little
mouse
you
are
i
wonder
that
your
mother
let
you
go
from
her
sight
do
you
know
that
you
get
up
conversations
with
strange
young
men
in
that
fashion
flossy
had
not
thought
of
it
at
all
but
now
she
said
a
little
drearily
as
if
the
subject
did
not
interest
her
but
i
have
often
held
conversations
with
strange
young
men
at
the
you
know
and
danced
with
them
too
when
i
knew
about
them
was
their
names
and
generally
i
forgot
that
marion
gave
a
light
laugh
that
is
different
she
said
letting
her
lip
curl
in
the
darkness
over
the
folly
of
her
own
words
what
its
proper
at
a
dance
in
very
improper
coming
home
from
do
you
see
what
do
you
think
she
said
the
minute
they
were
in
their
rooms
there
was
i
leaning
meditatively
over
the
boat
thinking
solemnly
on
the
truths
i
had
heard
and
that
absurd
little
morsel
was
having
a
flirtation
with
a
nice
young
man
here
is
one
of
the
fruits
of
the
system
what
on
earth
was
he
saying
to
you
flossy
do
said
flossy
for
the
second
time
that
evening
he
saying
any
harm
the
whole
thing
jarred
on
her
with
an
inexpressible
and
to
her
bewildering
pain
she
had
always
been
ready
for
fun
before
that
girl
is
homesick
or
something
marion
said
as
she
and
eurie
went
to
their
rooms
leaving
flossy
with
ruth
who
prefered
her
as
a
to
either
of
the
others
because
she
keep
from
talking
i
have
the
least
idea
what
is
the
matter
but
she
has
been
as
unlike
herself
as
possible
i
hope
she
is
going
to
get
sick
and
spoil
our
fun
how
silly
we
were
to
bring
her
anyway
the
baby
has
life
enough
to
see
the
frolic
of
the
thing
and
the
intellectual
is
miles
beyond
her
i
suspect
she
was
dreadfully
bored
this
evening
but
eurie
there
is
going
to
be
some
splendid
speaking
done
here
i
wonder
if
we
attended
a
good
many
of
the
meetings
chapter
unrest
flossy
went
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
into
the
starless
night
the
pain
in
her
heart
deepened
with
every
moment
if
there
was
only
some
one
to
ask
some
one
to
say
a
word
to
me
she
sighed
to
herself
it
seems
as
though
i
could
never
go
to
sleep
with
this
feeling
clinging
to
me
i
wonder
what
can
be
the
matter
perhaps
i
am
sick
and
am
going
to
die
it
feels
almost
like
that
and
i
am
not
fit
to
die
i
am
afraid
i
wonder
if
ruth
erskine
is
afraid
to
die
i
have
almost
a
mind
to
ask
her
i
wonder
if
she
ever
prays
people
who
are
not
afraid
of
death
are
always
those
who
pray
perhaps
she
will
i
feel
as
though
i
wanted
to
pray
i
think
if
i
only
knew
how
it
would
be
just
the
thing
to
do
if
she
kneels
down
i
mean
to
go
and
kneel
beside
her
these
were
some
of
the
thoughts
that
whirled
through
her
brain
as
she
stood
with
her
nose
pressed
to
the
glass
but
ruth
did
not
pray
she
went
around
with
the
composed
air
of
one
who
was
at
peace
with
all
the
world
and
when
her
elaborate
preparations
for
rest
were
concluded
she
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
without
one
thought
of
prayer
why
in
the
name
of
sense
do
you
come
to
bed
she
presently
asked
surveying
with
curious
glance
the
quiet
little
creature
whose
face
was
hidden
from
her
and
who
was
acting
entirely
out
of
accordance
with
anything
she
had
ever
seen
in
her
before
what
can
you
possibly
find
to
keep
you
gazing
out
of
that
window
it
ca
be
called
for
to
my
certain
knowledge
there
is
a
single
star
visible
in
fact
i
should
say
nothing
could
be
visible
but
the
darkness
for
a
minute
flossy
made
no
answer
she
did
not
move
nor
turn
her
head
but
presently
she
said
in
a
low
and
gentle
voice
ruth
should
you
be
afraid
to
die
to
die
said
ruth
and
i
have
no
means
of
telling
you
what
an
astonished
face
and
voice
she
had
flossy
shipley
what
do
you
mean
why
i
mean
said
flossy
in
the
same
quiet
tone
of
course
we
have
got
to
die
and
everybody
knows
it
and
what
i
say
is
should
you
be
afraid
if
it
were
you
know
humph
said
ruth
turning
her
pillow
and
waiting
to
beat
it
into
shape
before
she
spoke
further
i
have
the
least
idea
of
dying
but
how
can
you
be
of
that
you
might
to
die
you
know
people
do
sometimes
i
know
one
thing
am
perfectly
certain
of
it
and
that
is
that
you
will
take
cold
standing
there
and
making
yourself
dismal
you
are
shivering
like
a
leaf
i
can
see
you
from
here
if
that
is
all
the
good
to
be
gotten
from
the
impressions
that
they
harp
about
being
so
great
here
the
less
religion
they
have
the
better
and
there
is
quite
little
enough
you
may
be
sure
saying
which
ruth
turned
her
pillow
again
and
her
head
so
that
she
could
not
see
the
small
creature
at
the
window
she
was
unaccountably
rasped
not
to
say
startled
by
her
question
and
she
did
not
like
to
be
startled
she
liked
to
have
her
current
of
life
run
smoothly
as
for
flossy
she
gave
a
great
sigh
of
disappointment
and
unrest
and
turned
slowly
from
the
window
she
had
vaguely
hoped
for
help
of
some
sort
from
ruth
and
as
she
lay
down
on
her
prayerless
pillow
she
said
to
herself
if
she
had
only
knelt
down
i
should
certainly
have
done
so
too
and
perhaps
i
might
have
been
helped
out
of
this
dreadful
feeling
yet
so
ignorant
was
she
of
the
way
that
it
never
once
occurred
to
her
to
kneel
alone
and
pray
no
more
words
were
spoken
by
those
two
girls
that
night
but
each
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
and
tossed
about
restlessly
ruth
had
been
most
effectually
disturbed
and
try
as
best
she
could
it
was
impossible
to
banish
the
memory
of
those
quiet
words
you
might
to
die
people
do
you
know
to
actually
to
do
something
that
she
had
not
planned
to
do
and
was
not
quite
ready
for
would
be
a
new
experience
to
this
girl
yet
when
would
she
be
ready
to
plan
for
dying
at
last
she
grew
thoroughly
vexed
and
vented
her
disgust
on
the
religionists
who
got
up
excitements
for
the
purpose
of
turning
weak
brains
like
flossy
shipley
after
that
she
went
to
sleep
flossy
shipley
for
pity
sake
rig
your
self
up
in
that
awful
cashmere
it
rains
yet
and
you
will
just
be
going
around
with
five
wrinkles
on
your
forehead
all
day
besides
spoiling
your
dress
it
was
morning
and
the
door
of
communication
between
the
two
being
thrown
open
the
four
girls
were
in
full
tide
of
talk
and
preparation
for
fairpoint
flossy
though
kept
her
strangely
quiet
face
and
manner
the
night
had
not
brought
her
peace
she
had
tossed
restlessly
for
hours
and
when
at
last
she
slept
it
was
only
to
be
haunted
with
troubled
dreams
with
the
first
breath
of
morning
she
opened
her
eyes
and
felt
that
the
weight
of
yesterday
was
still
pressing
on
her
heart
what
i
wear
she
asked
in
an
absent
bewildered
way
of
eurie
who
had
objected
to
the
cashmere
i
sure
i
do
know
did
you
bring
anything
suited
to
the
rain
let
me
go
fishing
in
that
ponderous
trunk
and
see
if
i
ca
find
something
the
fishing
produced
nothing
more
suitable
than
a
heavy
black
silk
elaborately
trimmed
and
looking
as
eurie
phrased
it
elegantly
out
of
place
through
much
confusion
and
frolicking
the
four
were
at
last
entering
the
grounds
at
chautauqua
by
reason
of
their
superior
knowledge
marion
and
flossy
led
the
way
while
the
others
followed
eagerly
looking
and
exclaiming
i
tell
you
what
it
is
girls
eurie
said
eagerly
let
come
over
here
and
board
we
have
a
tent
or
a
cottage
a
tent
will
be
jollier
and
it
will
be
twice
as
much
fun
as
to
stay
at
the
hotel
there
being
no
dissenting
voice
to
this
proposal
they
started
in
much
glee
to
look
up
a
home
only
flossy
demurred
timidly
ca
we
go
to
the
meeting
girls
and
look
for
the
tent
afterward
the
meeting
has
commenced
i
hear
them
singing
it
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
bible
service
eurie
said
that
man
at
the
gate
handed
me
a
programme
who
wants
to
go
to
a
bible
service
we
have
bibles
enough
at
home
we
want
to
be
on
hand
at
eleven
because
edward
eggleston
is
to
speak
on
paradise
of
childhood
my
childhood
was
anything
but
paradise
but
i
am
anxious
to
know
what
he
will
make
of
it
flossy
succumbed
of
course
as
every
one
expected
she
would
and
the
party
went
in
search
of
tents
and
accommodations
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
suit
them
as
the
patient
and
courteous
president
found
i
do
like
the
location
of
any
one
of
them
ruth
erskine
said
of
course
she
was
the
hardest
to
suit
why
ca
we
have
one
of
those
in
that
row
on
the
hill
those
are
the
guest
tents
the
guest
tents
eurie
exclaimed
in
surprise
i
wonder
if
they
entertain
guests
here
who
are
they
why
those
who
have
been
invited
to
take
part
in
the
exercises
of
course
you
did
not
suppose
that
they
paid
their
own
expenses
and
did
the
work
besides
did
you
this
explanation
was
given
by
marion
who
by
virtue
of
her
experience
as
reporter
was
better
versed
in
the
ways
of
these
great
gatherings
than
the
others
what
an
idea
eurie
said
fancy
being
a
guest
and
speaking
at
this
great
meeting
being
a
person
of
distinction
you
know
so
that
people
would
be
pointing
you
out
and
telling
their
neighbors
who
you
were
there
goes
miss
mitchell
she
is
the
leading
speaker
on
books
how
does
that
sound
only
on
the
whole
i
should
choose
some
other
department
than
books
they
are
all
so
horridly
good
the
people
in
them
i
mean
that
one
ca
get
through
with
more
than
two
in
a
season
i
tried
to
read
one
last
week
for
sunday
but
i
abandoned
it
in
despair
this
was
an
aside
while
ruth
was
questioning
the
president
she
was
looking
dismayed
ca
we
have
one
of
the
tents
on
that
side
near
the
stand
those
were
taken
months
ago
this
is
a
large
gathering
you
know
i
should
think
it
was
then
it
seems
we
must
go
back
to
the
hotel
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
to
let
us
have
accommodations
at
any
price
the
gentlemanly
president
here
carefully
repressed
an
amused
smile
here
were
people
who
had
evidently
misunderstood
chautauqua
oh
yes
he
said
we
can
give
you
accommodations
only
not
the
very
best
i
am
sorry
to
say
our
best
tents
were
secured
many
months
ago
still
we
will
do
the
best
we
can
for
you
and
i
think
we
can
make
you
entirely
comfortable
people
have
different
ideas
as
to
the
meaning
of
that
word
miss
eurie
said
loftily
then
she
moved
to
another
tent
over
which
she
exclaimed
in
dismay
why
the
bed
is
made
up
pray
are
we
to
sleep
on
the
slats
oh
no
but
you
have
to
hire
all
those
things
you
know
have
you
seen
our
bulletin
there
are
parties
on
the
ground
prepared
to
fit
up
everything
that
you
need
and
to
do
it
very
reasonably
of
course
we
can
not
know
what
degree
of
expense
those
requiring
tents
care
to
incur
so
we
leave
that
matter
for
them
to
decide
for
themselves
you
can
have
as
many
or
as
few
comforts
as
you
choose
and
pay
accordingly
and
are
all
four
of
us
expected
to
occupy
this
one
room
there
was
an
expression
of
decided
disgust
on
miss
erskine
face
why
you
see
explained
the
amused
president
this
tent
is
designed
for
four
two
bedsteads
set
up
in
it
and
the
necessity
seems
to
be
upon
us
to
crowd
as
much
as
we
can
conveniently
there
will
be
no
danger
of
impure
air
you
know
for
you
have
all
to
breathe
and
you
really
do
have
toilet
stands
or
toilet
accommodations
what
a
way
to
live
another
voice
chimed
in
now
which
was
the
very
embodiment
of
refined
horror
and
you
do
have
pianos
nor
sofas
and
the
room
is
lighted
with
gas
i
sure
i
do
see
how
we
can
live
it
is
not
what
we
have
been
accustomed
to
this
was
marion
with
the
most
dancing
eyes
in
the
world
and
the
president
completed
the
scene
by
laughing
outright
suddenly
ruth
discovered
that
she
was
acting
the
part
of
a
simpleton
and
with
flushed
face
she
turned
from
them
and
walked
to
a
vacant
seat
in
the
opposite
direction
from
where
they
were
standing
we
will
take
this
one
she
said
haughtily
without
vouchsafing
it
a
look
i
presume
it
is
as
good
as
any
of
them
and
since
we
are
fairly
into
this
absurd
scrape
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
or
the
worst
of
it
marion
said
still
laughing
you
are
bent
on
doing
that
i
think
ruthie
by
a
violent
effort
and
rare
good
sense
ruth
controlled
herself
sufficiently
to
laugh
and
the
embarrassment
vanished
there
were
splendid
points
about
this
girl
character
not
the
least
among
them
being
the
ability
to
laugh
at
a
joke
that
had
been
turned
toward
herself
at
least
the
effect
was
splendid
the
reasons
therefore
might
have
been
better
it
was
because
her
sharp
brain
saw
the
better
effect
that
her
ability
to
do
this
thing
immediately
produced
on
the
people
around
her
but
i
shall
have
to
confess
that
a
poise
of
character
strong
enough
to
gracefully
avert
unpleasant
effects
arising
from
causes
of
her
own
making
ought
to
have
been
strong
enough
to
have
suppressed
the
causes
the
question
of
an
being
thus
summarily
disposed
of
the
party
set
themselves
to
work
with
great
energy
to
get
settled
marion
and
eurie
taking
the
lead
both
were
used
to
both
planning
and
working
and
marion
at
least
had
so
much
of
it
to
do
as
to
have
lost
all
desire
to
lead
unnecessarily
and
therefore
everything
grew
harmonious
there
was
a
good
deal
of
genuine
disgust
in
ruth
part
of
it
though
her
eyes
having
been
opened
she
bravely
tried
to
hide
the
feeling
from
the
rest
but
you
will
remember
that
she
had
lived
and
breathed
in
an
atmosphere
of
elegant
refinement
all
her
life
accepting
the
luxuries
of
life
as
common
necessities
until
they
had
really
become
such
to
her
and
the
idea
of
doing
without
many
things
that
people
during
camp
life
necessarily
find
themselves
to
do
without
was
not
only
strange
to
her
but
exceedingly
disagreeable
the
two
leaders
being
less
used
to
the
extremes
of
luxury
and
more
indifferent
to
them
by
nature
could
not
understand
and
had
little
sympathy
with
her
feeling
we
shall
have
to
go
back
after
all
to
the
hotel
eurie
said
as
she
dived
both
hands
into
the
straw
tick
and
tried
to
level
the
bed
we
have
too
fine
a
lady
among
us
she
can
not
sleep
on
a
bedstead
that
does
rest
its
aristocratic
legs
on
a
velvet
carpet
she
does
see
the
fun
at
all
i
thought
flossy
would
be
the
silly
one
but
flossy
is
in
a
fit
of
the
dumps
i
never
saw
her
so
indifferent
to
her
dress
before
see
her
now
bringing
that
stand
without
regard
to
rain
there
is
one
comfort
in
this
perpetual
rain
we
shall
have
less
dust
after
all
though
i
do
know
as
that
is
any
improvement
so
long
as
it
goes
and
makes
itself
up
into
mud
look
at
the
mud
on
my
dress
that
tent
we
were
looking
at
first
would
have
been
ever
so
much
the
best
but
after
ruth
silliness
i
really
had
the
face
to
suggest
a
change
i
thought
we
had
given
trouble
enough
she
makes
a
mistake
she
thinks
this
is
a
great
hotel
where
people
are
bound
to
get
all
the
money
they
can
and
give
as
little
return
instead
of
its
being
a
place
where
people
are
striving
to
be
as
accommodating
as
they
can
and
give
everybody
as
good
a
time
as
possible
in
the
midst
of
all
this
talk
and
work
they
left
and
ran
up
the
hill
to
the
tabernacle
where
the
crowds
were
gathering
to
hear
eggleston
it
was
a
novel
sight
to
these
four
girls
the
great
army
of
eager
strong
expectant
faces
the
ladies
almost
without
an
exception
dressed
to
match
the
rain
and
the
woods
looking
neither
tired
nor
annoyed
about
anything
looking
only
in
earnest
to
ruth
especially
it
came
like
a
revelation
she
looked
around
her
with
surprised
eyes
there
were
intellectual
faces
on
every
hand
there
was
the
hum
of
conversation
all
about
her
for
the
meeting
was
not
yet
opened
and
the
tone
of
their
words
was
different
from
any
with
which
her
life
had
been
familiar
they
seemed
lifted
up
enthused
they
seemed
to
have
found
something
worthy
of
enthusiasm
as
a
rule
ruth
had
not
enjoyed
enthusiastic
people
they
had
seemed
silly
to
her
and
you
will
admit
that
there
is
a
silly
side
to
the
consuming
of
a
great
deal
of
that
trait
on
the
dress
for
an
evening
party
or
the
arrangement
of
programmes
for
a
fancy
concert
just
now
she
had
a
glimmering
fancy
that
there
might
be
something
worthy
of
arresting
and
holding
one
eager
attention
they
look
alive
she
said
turning
from
right
to
left
among
the
rows
and
rows
of
faces
they
look
as
though
they
had
a
good
deal
to
do
and
they
thought
it
was
worth
doing
then
curiously
enough
there
came
suddenly
to
her
mind
that
question
which
she
had
banished
the
night
before
and
she
wondered
if
these
people
had
all
really
answered
it
to
their
satisfaction
flossy
took
a
seat
immediately
in
front
of
the
speaker
she
was
hungry
for
something
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
call
it
something
that
would
set
her
fevered
heart
at
rest
as
for
marion
and
eurie
they
hoped
with
all
their
hearts
that
the
hoosier
schoolmaster
would
give
them
a
rich
intellectual
treat
at
least
marion
was
after
the
intellectual
eurie
would
be
contented
if
she
got
the
fun
and
a
man
like
eggleston
has
enough
of
both
those
elements
to
make
sure
of
satisfying
their
hopes
but
would
he
bring
something
to
help
flossy
chapter
vi
feasts
he
does
look
in
the
least
as
i
thought
he
did
it
was
eurie
who
whispered
this
and
she
nudged
marion
arm
by
way
of
emphasis
as
she
did
it
marion
laughed
how
did
you
think
he
looked
oh
i
do
know
rough
rather
whereupon
marion
laughed
again
that
is
the
way
some
people
discriminate
she
whispered
back
you
think
because
he
wrote
about
rough
people
he
must
be
rough
and
when
one
writes
about
people
of
culture
and
elegance
you
think
straightway
that
he
is
the
personification
of
those
ideas
you
forget
you
see
that
the
world
is
full
to
the
brim
with
hypocrisy
and
it
is
easier
to
be
perfect
on
paper
than
it
is
anywhere
else
in
this
world
or
to
be
a
sinner
either
according
to
that
view
of
it
it
is
easy
enough
to
be
a
sinner
anywhere
hush
i
want
to
listen
for
which
want
the
people
all
about
her
must
have
been
very
thankful
our
young
ladies
gave
eggleston
their
attention
at
the
moment
when
he
was
drawling
out
in
his
most
nasal
and
ludicrous
tones
the
hymn
that
used
to
be
a
favorite
in
ninety
years
ago
broad
is
the
road
that
leads
to
death
and
thousands
walk
together
there
but
wisdom
shows
a
narrow
path
with
here
and
there
a
traveler
the
manner
in
which
part
of
these
lines
were
repeated
was
irresistibly
funny
to
eurie
it
was
explosively
so
she
laughed
until
the
seat
shook
with
mirth
to
be
sure
she
knew
nothing
about
modern
for
aught
that
she
was
certain
of
they
might
have
sung
that
very
hymn
in
the
first
church
the
sabbath
before
and
it
made
not
the
least
atom
of
difference
whether
they
did
or
not
the
way
in
which
eggleston
was
putting
it
was
funny
and
eurie
never
spoiled
fun
for
the
sake
of
sentiment
presently
she
looked
up
at
marion
for
sympathy
that
young
lady
eyes
were
in
a
blaze
of
indignation
what
in
the
world
was
the
matter
with
her
surely
she
with
her
hearty
and
unquestioning
belief
in
could
not
have
been
disturbed
by
any
jar
let
me
tell
you
a
word
about
marion
away
back
in
her
childhood
there
was
a
memory
of
a
little
dingy
kitchen
one
of
the
oldest
and
dreariest
of
its
kind
where
the
chimney
smoked
and
the
winter
wind
crawled
in
through
endless
cracks
and
crannies
where
it
was
not
always
possible
to
get
enough
to
eat
during
the
hardest
times
but
there
was
a
large
covered
with
frayed
and
faded
calico
and
in
this
chair
sat
often
of
a
winter
evening
a
old
man
with
thin
and
clothes
with
a
worn
and
sickly
face
with
a
few
gray
hairs
straggling
sadly
about
on
his
smooth
crown
and
that
old
man
used
often
and
often
to
drone
out
in
a
cracked
voice
and
in
a
tune
pitched
too
low
by
half
an
octave
the
very
words
which
had
just
been
repeated
in
marion
hearing
what
of
all
that
why
that
little
gloomy
kitchen
was
marion
memory
of
home
that
old
tired
man
was
her
father
and
he
used
to
sing
those
words
while
his
hand
wandered
tenderly
through
the
curls
of
her
brown
head
and
patted
softly
the
white
forehead
over
which
they
fell
and
all
of
love
that
there
was
in
life
all
that
the
word
tenderness
meant
all
that
was
dear
or
sweet
or
to
be
reverenced
was
embodied
in
that
one
memory
to
marion
now
you
understand
the
flashing
eyes
she
did
not
believe
it
at
all
she
believed
or
thought
she
did
that
the
broad
and
narrow
roads
were
all
nonsense
that
go
where
you
would
or
do
what
you
would
all
the
roads
led
to
and
that
was
the
end
but
the
father
who
had
quavered
through
those
lines
so
many
times
had
staked
his
hopes
forever
on
that
belief
and
the
assurance
of
it
had
clothed
his
face
in
a
grand
smile
as
he
lay
dying
a
smile
that
she
liked
to
think
of
that
she
did
not
like
to
hear
ridiculed
and
to
her
excited
imagination
eggleston
seemed
to
be
ridiculing
the
faith
on
which
the
hymn
was
built
they
are
more
thorough
hypocrites
than
i
supposed
she
said
in
scorn
and
hardly
in
undertone
in
answer
to
eurie
inquiring
look
i
believe
the
stuff
myself
but
i
always
supposed
the
ministers
did
i
gave
some
of
them
at
least
credit
for
sincerity
but
it
seems
it
is
nothing
but
a
fable
to
be
laughed
to
scorn
why
marion
eurie
said
and
her
look
expressed
surprise
and
dismay
he
is
not
making
fun
of
religion
you
know
he
is
simply
referring
to
the
inappropriateness
of
such
hymns
for
children
what
is
so
glaringly
inappropriate
about
it
if
they
really
believe
the
bible
i
sure
it
says
there
that
there
are
two
roads
one
broad
and
the
other
narrow
and
that
many
people
are
on
one
and
but
few
on
the
other
why
should
it
be
put
into
a
hymn
if
it
is
desirable
to
impress
it
i
sure
i
do
know
eurie
said
unaccustomed
to
being
put
through
a
course
of
logic
only
you
know
i
suppose
he
simply
means
that
it
is
beyond
their
comprehensions
they
must
have
remarkably
limited
comprehensions
then
if
they
are
incapable
of
understanding
so
simple
a
figure
of
speech
as
that
there
are
two
ways
to
go
and
one
is
harder
and
safer
than
the
other
i
understood
it
when
it
was
sung
to
me
and
i
was
a
very
little
child
and
believed
it
too
until
i
saw
the
lives
of
people
contradict
it
but
if
i
believed
it
still
i
would
not
make
public
sport
of
it
at
this
point
ruth
leaned
forward
from
the
seat
behind
and
whispered
girls
do
keep
still
you
are
drawing
the
attention
of
all
the
people
around
you
and
disturbing
everybody
after
that
they
kept
still
but
the
good
doctor
had
effectually
sealed
one
heart
to
whatever
that
was
tender
and
earnest
he
might
have
to
say
she
sat
erect
with
scornful
eyes
and
glowing
cheeks
and
when
the
first
flush
of
excitement
passed
off
was
simply
harder
and
gayer
than
before
who
imagined
such
a
result
as
that
nobody
of
course
but
how
perfectly
foolish
and
illogical
could
she
see
that
eggleston
only
meant
to
refer
to
the
fact
that
literature
both
of
prose
and
poetry
had
been
improved
by
being
brought
to
the
level
of
childish
minds
and
to
reprove
that
way
of
teaching
religious
truth
that
leaves
a
somber
dismal
impression
on
youthful
hearts
apparently
she
could
not
since
she
did
not
as
for
being
absurd
and
illogical
i
not
say
that
she
was
i
am
simply
giving
you
facts
as
they
occurred
i
think
myself
that
she
was
dishonoring
the
memory
of
her
father
ten
thousand
times
more
than
any
chance
and
unmeant
word
of
the
speakers
could
possibly
have
done
the
only
trouble
was
that
she
was
such
an
idiot
she
did
not
see
it
and
she
prided
herself
on
her
powers
of
reasoning
too
but
the
world
is
full
of
idiots
she
sat
like
a
stone
during
the
rest
of
the
brilliant
lecture
many
things
she
heard
because
she
could
not
help
hearing
many
she
admired
because
it
was
in
her
to
admire
a
brilliant
and
charming
thing
and
she
could
not
help
that
either
but
she
could
shut
her
to
all
tenderness
of
feeling
and
all
softening
influences
and
that
she
did
with
much
satisfaction
deliberately
steeling
herself
against
the
words
of
a
man
because
he
had
quoted
a
chance
line
that
her
father
used
to
sing
while
she
lived
every
day
of
her
life
in
defiance
of
the
principles
by
which
her
father
shaped
his
life
and
his
death
verily
the
ways
of
girls
are
beyond
understanding
eurie
enjoyed
it
all
when
eggleston
told
of
the
men
that
as
soon
as
their
children
grew
a
little
too
restless
had
business
down
town
she
clapped
her
hands
softly
and
whispered
that
is
for
all
the
world
like
father
neddie
and
puss
were
never
in
a
whining
fit
in
their
lives
that
father
did
at
once
think
of
a
patient
he
had
neglected
to
visit
that
day
and
rush
off
she
laughed
over
the
thought
that
women
were
shut
in
with
little
steam
engines
and
said
that
a
capital
name
for
them
we
have
three
at
home
that
are
always
just
at
the
very
point
of
explosion
i
mean
to
write
to
mother
and
tell
her
i
have
found
a
new
name
for
them
when
he
suggested
the
scissors
and
the
colored
crayons
with
which
they
could
make
wonderful
yellow
dogs
with
green
tails
and
blue
eyes
her
delight
became
so
great
that
she
looked
around
to
ruth
to
help
her
enjoy
it
and
said
you
see
if
i
do
invest
in
a
ton
of
colored
crayons
the
very
first
thing
i
do
when
i
get
home
it
is
just
capital
so
strange
i
never
thought
of
it
before
you
did
not
think
of
it
now
ruth
said
in
her
quiet
cooling
way
give
the
speaker
credit
for
his
own
ideas
please
half
the
world
have
to
do
the
thinking
for
the
other
half
always
that
is
the
reason
so
much
is
left
undone
then
retorted
eurie
with
unfailing
good
humor
and
turned
back
to
the
speaker
in
time
to
hear
his
description
of
the
superintendent
that
was
so
long
in
finding
the
place
to
sing
that
the
boys
before
him
went
around
the
world
while
he
was
giving
the
number
slow
people
said
she
going
down
the
hill
afterward
i
never
could
endure
them
and
i
shall
have
less
patience
with
them
in
future
than
ever
was
he
splendid
ruth
you
liked
the
part
about
dickens
of
course
a
valuable
help
the
lecture
will
be
to
your
if
all
you
have
got
is
an
added
feeling
of
impatience
toward
slow
people
unfortunately
for
you
they
are
in
the
world
and
will
be
very
likely
to
stay
in
it
and
a
very
good
sort
of
people
they
are
too
it
was
marion
who
said
this
and
her
tone
was
dry
and
unsympathetic
eurie
turned
to
her
curiously
you
did
like
him
she
said
did
you
i
am
so
surprised
i
thought
you
would
think
him
splendid
on
your
favorite
hobby
too
i
said
to
myself
this
will
be
just
in
marion
line
she
has
so
much
to
say
about
teaching
children
by
rote
in
a
dull
and
uninteresting
way
you
forgive
him
for
reciting
that
horrid
old
hymn
in
such
a
funny
way
flossy
do
you
suppose
you
can
ever
hear
that
hymn
read
again
without
laughing
what
was
the
matter
marion
who
imagined
you
had
any
sentimental
drawings
toward
watts
hymns
i
did
even
know
it
was
watts
hymn
marion
said
indifferently
but
i
hate
to
hear
any
one
go
back
on
his
own
belief
if
he
honestly
believes
in
the
sentiments
of
that
verse
and
they
certainly
are
bible
sentiments
he
should
make
fun
of
it
but
i
sure
it
is
of
no
consequence
to
me
he
may
make
fun
of
the
whole
bible
if
he
chooses
verse
by
verse
and
preach
a
melting
sermon
from
it
the
very
next
sabbath
it
will
be
all
the
same
to
me
let
us
go
in
search
of
some
dinner
and
not
talk
any
more
about
him
but
that
is
fair
you
are
unjust
is
she
ruth
i
say
he
make
fun
of
religion
as
marion
persists
in
saying
that
he
did
of
course
not
ruth
said
a
minister
would
hardly
be
guilty
of
doing
that
he
was
simply
comparing
the
advanced
methods
of
the
present
with
the
stupidity
of
the
past
and
obstinate
marion
said
then
he
ought
to
get
a
new
bible
for
the
very
same
notions
were
in
it
that
were
when
she
was
a
child
and
learned
verses
and
that
was
all
that
this
discussion
amounted
to
nobody
had
appealed
to
flossy
she
had
stood
looking
with
an
indifferent
air
around
her
until
marion
turned
suddenly
and
said
what
did
the
lecture
say
to
you
flossy
eurie
seems
very
anxious
to
get
out
of
it
something
for
our
needs
as
they
say
in
church
what
was
yours
flossy
hesitated
like
a
timid
child
flushed
and
then
paled
and
finally
said
simply
i
have
been
thinking
ever
since
he
spoke
it
of
that
one
sentence
has
died
out
of
the
world
i
was
wondering
if
it
were
true
and
i
was
wishing
that
it
was
all
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
in
astonished
silence
such
a
strange
thing
for
flossy
to
say
what
of
it
said
marion
presently
what
if
it
has
or
rather
what
if
it
were
never
in
the
world
it
was
that
side
of
it
that
i
thought
about
it
was
what
if
it
were
and
what
then
why
then
i
should
like
to
see
the
person
who
had
it
just
to
see
how
he
would
seem
marion
laughed
somewhat
scornfully
curiosity
is
at
the
bottom
of
your
wise
thought
is
it
well
my
little
mousie
i
am
amazingly
afraid
you
are
destined
never
to
discover
how
it
will
seem
so
i
would
puzzle
my
brains
about
it
it
might
be
too
much
for
them
shall
we
go
to
dinner
you
should
have
seen
our
four
young
ladies
taking
their
first
meal
at
chautauqua
it
was
an
experience
not
to
be
forgotten
they
went
to
the
hotel
this
was
a
long
board
building
improvised
for
the
occasion
and
filled
with
as
many
comforts
as
the
of
the
occasion
could
furnish
to
miss
erskine
the
word
hotel
had
only
one
sort
of
association
she
had
been
a
traveler
in
her
own
country
only
and
it
had
been
her
fortune
to
be
intimate
only
with
the
hotels
in
large
cities
and
only
with
those
where
people
go
whose
purses
are
full
to
overflowing
so
she
had
come
to
associate
with
the
name
all
that
was
elegant
or
refined
or
luxurious
when
the
president
of
the
grounds
inquired
whether
they
would
have
tickets
for
the
hotel
or
one
of
the
miss
erskine
had
answered
without
hesitation
for
the
hotel
of
course
i
never
have
anything
to
do
with
they
are
almost
certain
to
be
second
rate
said
president
kept
his
own
counsel
thinking
i
fancy
that
here
was
a
girl
who
needed
some
lessons
in
the
practical
things
of
this
life
and
chautauqua
hotels
were
good
places
in
which
to
take
lessons
imagine
now
if
you
can
the
look
of
this
lady
face
as
they
made
their
way
with
much
difficulty
down
the
long
room
and
looked
about
them
on
either
side
for
seats
a
hotel
indeed
she
said
in
utter
contempt
and
disgust
as
one
of
the
attendants
signaled
them
and
politely
drew
back
the
long
board
seat
that
did
duty
in
the
place
of
chairs
and
answered
for
five
or
if
you
were
good
natured
and
crowded
for
six
people
he
was
just
as
polite
in
his
attentions
as
if
the
unplaned
seat
had
been
a
carved
chair
of
graceful
shape
and
pattern
one
would
suppose
that
ruth
might
have
taken
a
hint
from
his
example
but
the
truth
is
she
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
who
are
so
accustomed
to
polite
attentions
that
it
is
only
their
absence
which
calls
forth
remark
the
idea
of
naming
this
horrid
dirty
old
a
hotel
and
she
carefully
and
disdainfully
spread
her
waterproof
cloak
on
the
seat
before
she
took
it
eurie
merry
laugh
rang
out
until
others
looked
and
smiled
in
sympathy
with
her
fun
whatever
it
was
what
in
the
world
did
you
expect
ruthie
i
declare
you
are
too
comical
i
verily
believe
you
expected
brussels
carpets
and
mirrors
in
which
you
could
admire
yourself
all
the
while
you
were
eating
i
expected
a
ruth
said
in
no
wise
diminishing
her
lofty
tone
that
is
what
is
advertised
and
people
naturally
do
not
look
for
so
much
deception
in
a
religious
gathering
this
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
shanty
chautauqua
was
doing
one
thing
for
this
young
lady
which
surprised
and
annoyed
her
it
was
helping
her
to
get
acquainted
with
herself
up
to
this
time
she
had
looked
upon
herself
as
a
person
of
smooth
and
even
temperament
not
by
any
means
easily
ruffled
or
turned
from
her
quiet
poise
she
had
prided
herself
on
her
composed
gracefully
dignified
way
of
receiving
things
she
never
hurried
she
never
was
breathless
and
flushed
and
apologetic
over
something
that
she
ought
or
ought
not
to
have
done
which
was
a
chronic
state
with
eurie
she
never
was
in
a
thorough
and
undisguised
rage
as
marion
was
quite
likely
to
be
she
was
in
her
own
estimation
a
model
of
propriety
all
this
until
she
came
to
chautauqua
now
great
was
her
surprise
to
discover
in
herself
a
disposition
to
be
utterly
disgusted
with
things
that
to
marion
were
of
so
little
consequences
as
to
be
unnoticed
and
that
to
eurie
were
positive
sources
of
fun
doubtless
you
understand
her
better
than
she
did
herself
the
truth
is
it
is
a
comparatively
easy
matter
to
be
gracious
and
courteous
and
unruffled
when
everything
about
you
is
moving
exactly
according
to
your
mind
and
when
you
can
think
of
nothing
earthly
to
be
annoyed
about
there
are
some
natures
that
are
deceiving
their
own
hearts
in
just
such
an
atmosphere
as
this
they
are
not
the
lowest
type
of
nature
by
any
means
the
small
petty
trials
that
come
to
every
life
are
beneath
them
if
it
rains
when
they
want
to
walk
they
can
go
in
a
handsome
carriage
and
keep
their
tempers
if
their
elegant
new
robes
prove
to
be
badly
made
they
can
have
them
remodeled
and
made
more
elegant
with
a
superior
composure
in
just
so
far
are
they
above
the
class
who
can
endure
nothing
in
the
shape
of
annoyances
or
disappointment
however
small
the
fact
is
however
that
there
are
petty
annoyance
coming
in
their
line
of
life
that
would
be
altogether
too
much
for
them
but
of
this
they
remain
in
graceful
ignorance
until
some
chautauqua
brings
the
sleeping
shadows
to
the
surface
chapter
vii
table
talk
what
is
your
private
explanation
of
the
word
marion
asked
she
was
in
an
argumentative
mood
and
it
made
almost
no
difference
to
her
which
side
of
the
question
she
argued
webster
says
it
is
a
place
to
entertain
strangers
but
you
seem
to
attach
some
special
importance
to
the
term
is
that
all
that
webster
says
the
questioner
was
not
ruth
but
a
man
who
sat
just
opposite
to
them
at
the
table
and
while
he
waited
for
his
order
to
be
filled
watched
with
amused
eyes
the
four
gills
who
were
evidently
in
a
new
element
he
was
not
a
young
man
and
his
gray
hairs
would
have
arrested
the
pertness
of
the
reply
on
marion
tongue
at
any
other
time
than
this
but
you
remember
that
she
was
not
in
a
good
mood
she
answered
promptly
yes
sir
he
says
ever
so
many
things
in
fact
he
is
the
most
voluminous
author
i
ever
read
the
gentleman
laughed
the
pertness
seemed
to
amuse
him
did
i
limit
my
question
he
said
pleasantly
he
is
voluminous
and
what
a
sensible
book
he
has
written
i
wish
all
authors
had
given
us
so
much
information
but
i
meant
is
that
all
he
says
about
hotels
does
he
justify
your
friend
just
a
little
bit
in
her
expectations
i
sure
i
do
know
marion
said
amused
in
turn
at
the
interest
which
the
elderly
gentleman
took
in
the
question
he
has
said
so
much
that
i
have
had
time
to
digest
it
all
if
you
have
wo
you
please
enlighten
me
as
to
his
wisdom
on
this
subject
one
of
some
style
or
pretensions
quoted
the
old
gentleman
so
webster
adds
you
see
i
am
interested
in
the
subject
and
he
laughed
pleasantly
i
have
been
looking
it
up
which
must
be
my
apology
for
addressing
you
young
ladies
if
so
old
a
man
as
i
must
apologize
for
being
interested
in
girls
the
fact
is
i
had
occasion
to
talk
with
a
young
man
yesterday
who
took
the
people
to
task
most
roundly
for
that
very
name
on
the
ground
that
they
had
no
right
to
it
that
it
was
a
misnomer
i
have
been
struck
with
the
thought
that
nothing
is
trivial
not
even
the
name
that
happens
to
be
chosen
for
a
house
where
one
for
his
dinner
with
a
strong
emphasis
on
the
word
wait
which
eurie
understood
and
laughed
over
except
the
remarks
that
people
make
about
such
things
marion
said
answering
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
and
bestowing
a
wicked
glance
on
ruth
they
are
trivial
enough
did
you
agree
with
the
young
gentleman
no
i
thought
it
all
over
and
consulted
webster
as
i
said
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
view
of
this
being
a
more
pretentious
house
than
either
of
the
others
they
had
a
right
to
the
word
webster
does
say
what
degree
of
pretension
is
necessary
you
know
the
lifting
of
ruth
eyebrows
at
this
point
was
so
expressive
that
all
the
party
laughed
but
the
old
gentleman
grew
grave
again
in
a
moment
as
he
said
but
the
thought
that
impressed
me
most
was
what
a
very
perfect
system
of
faith
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
is
how
completely
it
commends
itself
to
the
human
heart
since
the
very
slightest
departure
from
what
is
regarded
as
strictly
true
and
right
when
it
is
done
by
a
christian
society
or
individual
is
noticed
and
commented
upon
by
they
seem
to
know
of
a
certainty
that
it
is
not
according
to
the
spirit
of
christ
this
last
sentence
struck
marion
dumb
how
fond
she
was
of
caviling
at
christian
lives
was
she
really
thus
giving
all
the
time
an
unconscious
tribute
to
the
truth
and
purity
of
the
christian
faith
it
was
a
merry
dinner
after
all
eaten
with
steel
forks
and
without
napkins
and
with
plated
spoons
if
you
were
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
one
the
rush
of
people
was
very
great
and
with
their
inconvenient
accommodations
the
process
of
serving
was
slow
marion
her
eyes
being
opened
went
to
studying
the
people
about
her
she
found
that
courteous
was
the
rule
and
selfishness
and
ungraciousness
the
exception
inconveniences
were
put
up
with
and
merrily
laughed
over
by
people
who
from
their
dress
and
manners
could
be
accustomed
to
only
the
best
marion
took
mental
notes
they
do
not
act
in
the
least
like
the
mass
of
people
who
stop
at
railroad
for
their
dinner
they
are
patient
and
courteous
under
difficulties
they
did
not
come
here
for
the
purpose
of
being
entertained
if
they
did
the
accommodations
would
satisfy
there
was
another
little
thing
that
interested
marion
as
the
tables
kept
filling
and
those
who
had
been
served
made
room
for
those
who
had
not
she
found
herself
watching
curiously
what
proportion
of
the
guests
observed
that
instant
of
silent
thanks
with
covered
eyes
it
was
so
brief
so
slight
a
thing
i
venture
that
scarcely
a
person
there
noticed
it
much
less
imagined
that
there
was
a
pair
of
keen
gray
eyes
over
in
the
corner
looking
and
calculating
concerning
them
what
if
they
all
had
to
wear
badges
she
said
to
herself
badges
that
read
am
a
christian
i
wonder
how
many
of
them
it
would
influence
to
different
words
than
they
are
speaking
or
to
different
acts
i
wonder
if
they
all
wear
them
i
wonder
if
the
distinction
is
really
marked
so
one
looking
on
could
detect
the
difference
though
all
of
them
are
strangers
i
mean
to
watch
during
these
two
weeks
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
very
well
brother
pope
a
convenient
place
for
the
study
of
man
is
chautauqua
i
take
it
up
who
knows
but
i
may
learn
a
new
branch
to
teach
the
graded
infants
in
ward
no
ruth
did
not
recover
her
equanimity
she
was
rasped
on
every
side
those
steel
forks
were
a
positive
sting
to
her
she
shuddered
as
the
steel
touched
her
lips
she
had
no
spoon
at
all
and
she
looked
on
in
utter
disgust
while
eurie
merrily
stirred
her
tea
with
her
fork
when
the
waiter
came
at
last
with
hearty
apologies
for
keeping
them
waiting
for
their
spoons
and
the
old
gentleman
said
cordially
all
in
good
time
we
shall
not
starve
even
if
we
get
no
spoons
she
curled
her
lip
disdainfully
and
murmured
that
she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
the
conveniences
of
life
and
found
it
somewhat
difficult
to
do
without
them
when
one
is
in
the
mood
for
grumbling
there
is
no
easier
thing
in
the
world
than
to
find
food
for
that
spirit
and
ruth
continued
her
pastime
waxing
louder
and
more
decided
after
the
genial
old
man
had
left
their
neighborhood
what
is
the
use
in
eurie
said
at
last
half
petulantly
she
was
growing
very
tired
of
this
exhibition
what
did
you
expect
they
are
doing
as
well
as
they
can
without
any
doubt
just
imagine
what
it
must
be
to
get
conveniences
together
for
this
vast
crowd
they
did
not
expect
anything
like
such
a
large
attendance
at
first
i
heard
them
say
so
and
that
makes
it
harder
to
wait
upon
them
but
of
course
they
are
doing
just
as
well
as
they
can
and
we
fare
as
well
as
any
of
them
do
you
be
so
foolish
as
to
believe
that
ruth
said
with
a
curling
lip
if
you
could
see
behind
the
scenes
you
would
soon
discover
something
very
different
that
is
why
it
is
so
provoking
to
me
let
people
who
can
not
afford
to
pay
any
better
take
such
as
they
can
get
but
what
right
had
they
to
suppose
that
we
had
not
the
money
to
pay
for
what
we
wish
i
sure
not
a
pauper
you
will
find
that
there
is
a
place
where
the
select
few
can
get
what
they
want
and
have
it
served
in
a
respectable
manner
and
i
say
i
do
like
it
i
have
been
accustomed
to
the
decencies
of
life
just
behind
them
the
talk
was
going
on
unceasingly
and
one
voice
at
this
point
rising
higher
than
the
others
caught
the
attention
of
our
girls
eurie
turned
suddenly
and
tried
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
speaker
something
in
the
voice
sounded
natural
a
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
the
gentleman
between
them
and
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
face
she
turned
back
eagerly
girls
that
is
schuyler
germain
where
ruth
asked
with
sudden
interest
in
her
voice
over
at
that
table
in
a
cloak
and
black
straw
hat
and
eating
boiled
potatoes
with
a
steel
fork
what
about
being
behind
the
scenes
now
ruthie
to
fully
appreciate
this
you
must
understand
that
even
among
the
erskines
to
get
as
high
as
schulyer
germain
was
to
get
as
high
as
the
aristocracy
of
this
world
reached
not
that
she
lived
in
any
grander
style
than
the
erskines
or
showed
that
she
had
more
money
but
every
one
knew
that
her
bank
accounts
were
very
heavy
and
besides
she
was
the
daughter
of
wadsworth
hillyer
of
washington
and
the
by
direct
descent
of
one
of
england
noblemen
she
was
traveled
and
cultivated
and
all
but
titled
through
her
youngest
daughter
could
american
ambition
reach
higher
and
there
she
sat
at
a
table
made
of
pine
boards
eating
boiled
potatoes
with
a
steel
fork
could
english
nobility
sink
lower
ruth
looked
over
at
her
in
quiet
surprise
for
a
moment
and
then
gave
her
head
its
haughty
toss
as
she
met
eurie
mischievous
eyes
and
said
it
is
not
an
aristocracy
of
position
here
then
the
leaders
keep
all
their
nice
things
and
places
for
themselves
that
is
smaller
than
i
supposed
them
to
be
at
this
particular
moment
there
was
an
uprising
from
the
table
just
behind
them
half
a
dozen
gentlemen
leaving
their
empty
plates
and
in
full
tide
of
talk
making
their
way
down
the
hall
the
girls
looked
and
nudged
each
other
as
they
recognized
them
the
younger
of
the
two
foremost
had
a
face
that
can
not
easily
be
mistaken
and
eurie
having
seen
it
once
did
not
need
marion
that
is
mr
vincent
and
ruth
herself
thrown
off
her
guard
recognized
and
exclaimed
over
hodge
this
climax
was
too
much
for
eurie
she
threw
down
her
fork
to
clap
her
hands
in
softly
glee
oh
ruthie
ruthie
how
has
your
dismal
castle
of
favoritism
faded
yonder
is
the
queen
of
american
society
eating
pie
at
this
very
instant
with
the
very
fork
which
did
duty
on
her
potato
and
here
goes
the
king
of
the
feast
wiping
his
lips
on
his
own
handkerchief
instead
of
a
damask
napkin
it
was
at
this
moment
when
ruth
follies
and
ill
humors
were
rising
to
an
almost
unbearable
height
that
her
higher
nature
asserted
itself
and
shone
forth
in
a
rich
full
laugh
then
in
much
glee
and
good
feeling
they
followed
the
crowd
down
the
hill
to
the
auditorium
for
the
benefit
of
such
poor
benighted
beings
as
have
never
seen
chautauqua
let
me
explain
that
the
auditorium
was
the
great
temple
where
the
congregation
assembled
for
united
service
such
a
grand
temple
as
it
was
the
pillars
thereof
were
great
solemn
trees
with
their
green
leaves
arching
overhead
in
festoons
of
beauty
i
do
know
how
many
seats
there
were
nor
how
many
could
be
accommodated
at
the
auditorium
eurie
set
out
to
walk
up
and
down
the
long
aisles
one
day
and
count
the
seats
but
she
found
that
which
so
arrested
her
attention
before
she
was
down
the
central
aisle
that
she
forgot
all
about
it
and
there
was
never
any
time
afterward
for
that
work
i
mean
to
tell
you
about
that
day
when
i
get
to
it
the
grand
stand
was
down
here
in
front
of
all
these
seats
spacious
and
convenient
the
pillars
thereof
festooned
with
flags
from
many
nations
the
large
piano
occupied
a
central
point
the
speaker
desk
at
its
feet
in
the
central
of
the
stand
the
reporters
tables
and
chairs
just
below
i
ought
to
have
one
of
those
chairs
marion
said
as
they
passed
the
convenient
little
space
railed
off
from
the
rest
of
the
audience
just
as
if
i
were
not
a
real
reporter
because
i
write
in
plain
good
english
instead
of
racing
over
the
paper
and
making
queer
little
tracks
that
only
one
person
in
five
thousand
can
read
if
i
were
not
the
most
modest
and
retiring
of
mortals
i
would
go
boldly
up
and
claim
a
seat
what
is
to
be
next
ruth
asked
are
we
supposed
to
be
devoted
to
all
these
meetings
i
thought
we
were
only
going
to
one
now
and
then
we
wo
be
alive
in
two
weeks
from
now
if
we
pin
ourselves
down
here
in
the
way
that
we
have
been
doing
chimed
in
eurie
just
think
here
we
have
been
to
every
single
meeting
they
have
had
yet
except
the
one
last
night
and
one
this
morning
we
are
going
to
skip
every
one
that
we
possibly
can
said
marion
but
the
one
that
is
to
come
just
now
is
decidedly
the
one
that
we
ca
the
speaker
is
calkins
of
buffalo
i
heard
him
four
years
ago
and
it
is
one
of
the
few
sermons
that
i
remember
to
this
day
i
always
said
if
i
ever
had
another
chance
i
should
certainly
hear
him
again
i
like
his
subject
this
afternoon
too
it
is
appropriate
to
my
condition
what
is
the
subject
flossy
asked
with
a
sudden
glow
of
interest
it
is
what
a
christian
can
learn
from
a
heathen
i
the
heathen
and
i
presume
dr
calkins
is
the
christian
so
he
is
to
see
what
he
can
learn
from
me
i
take
it
and
naturally
i
am
anxious
to
know
flossy
interested
in
that
i
can
see
it
from
her
face
she
knows
she
is
a
heathen
she
is
a
good
proper
little
christian
but
it
is
your
duty
my
dear
to
find
what
you
can
learn
from
me
what
can
he
possibly
make
of
such
a
subject
as
that
ruth
asked
curiously
i
do
believe
i
want
to
hear
him
is
he
so
very
talented
marion
i
do
know
have
the
least
idea
whether
he
is
what
you
call
talented
or
not
he
says
things
exactly
as
though
he
knew
they
were
so
and
for
the
time
being
he
makes
you
feel
as
though
you
were
a
perfect
simpleton
for
not
knowing
it
too
and
you
like
to
be
made
to
feel
like
a
simpleton
is
that
the
reason
you
resolved
to
hear
him
again
i
like
to
meet
a
man
once
in
a
while
who
knows
how
to
do
it
and
for
the
matter
of
that
i
would
mind
being
made
to
feel
the
truth
of
the
things
that
he
says
if
one
could
only
made
it
is
the
fault
of
the
preaching
that
it
all
feels
like
a
pretty
story
and
nothing
else
it
is
the
fault
of
the
wretched
practicing
that
the
sheep
go
home
and
do
it
makes
one
feel
like
being
an
goat
and
done
with
it
instead
of
being
such
a
perfect
idiot
of
a
sheep
at
this
point
the
talk
suddenly
ceased
for
the
leaders
began
to
assemble
and
the
service
commenced
ruth
and
marion
exchanged
comic
glances
when
they
discovered
the
heathen
of
the
afternoon
to
be
socrates
and
marion
presently
whispered
that
she
was
evidently
to
play
the
character
of
the
old
fellow
wife
and
eurie
whispered
to
them
both
now
i
want
to
know
if
that
horrid
zantippe
was
socrates
wife
upon
my
word
i
never
knew
it
before
she
was
to
blame
after
all
for
being
such
a
wretch
what
do
you
mean
marion
whispered
back
with
scornful
eyes
socrates
was
the
grandest
old
man
that
ever
lived
pooh
he
was
he
did
know
any
more
than
little
mites
of
children
do
nowdays
i
never
could
understand
why
his
philosophy
was
so
remarkable
only
that
he
lived
in
a
heathen
country
and
got
ahead
of
all
the
rest
but
if
he
were
living
now
he
would
be
a
pigmy
i
wish
he
were
marion
said
with
her
eyes
still
flashing
i
would
like
to
see
such
a
life
as
he
lived
this
girl
was
a
hero
worshiper
her
cheeks
could
burn
and
her
eyes
glow
over
the
grand
stories
of
old
heathen
characters
and
she
could
melt
to
tears
over
their
trials
and
wrongs
and
yet
she
passed
by
in
haughty
silence
the
sublime
life
that
of
all
others
is
the
only
perfect
one
on
record
and
she
had
no
tears
to
shed
over
the
shameful
and
pitiful
story
of
the
cross
what
a
strange
girl
she
was
i
wonder
if
it
be
possible
that
there
are
any
others
like
her
chapter
viii
at
evening
time
it
shall
be
bright
meantime
flossy
shipley
came
to
no
place
where
her
heart
could
rest
she
went
through
that
first
day
at
chautauqua
in
a
sort
of
maze
hearing
and
yet
not
hearing
and
longing
in
her
very
soul
for
something
that
she
did
not
hear
that
is
she
did
not
hear
it
distinctly
and
fairly
stated
so
that
she
could
grasp
it
and
act
upon
it
and
yet
it
was
shadowed
all
around
her
and
hinted
at
in
every
word
that
was
uttered
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
forget
that
there
was
a
great
something
in
which
the
most
of
these
people
were
eagerly
interested
and
which
was
sealed
to
her
she
felt
it
dimly
all
the
while
that
eggleston
was
speaking
she
felt
it
sensibly
when
they
sang
she
felt
it
in
the
chance
words
that
caught
her
ear
on
every
side
as
the
meeting
closed
bright
fresh
words
of
greeting
of
gladness
of
satisfaction
but
every
one
of
them
containing
a
ring
that
she
could
hear
but
not
copy
what
did
it
mean
and
above
all
why
did
she
care
what
it
meant
when
she
had
been
happy
all
her
life
before
without
knowing
or
thinking
anything
about
it
as
they
went
down
the
hill
to
dinner
she
loitered
somewhat
behind
the
others
thinking
while
they
talked
as
the
throng
pressed
down
around
them
there
came
one
whose
face
she
instantly
recognized
it
belonged
to
the
young
man
who
had
spoken
to
her
on
the
boat
the
evening
before
the
face
recalled
the
earnest
words
that
he
had
spoken
and
the
tone
of
restful
satisfaction
in
which
they
were
spoken
his
face
wore
the
same
look
now
interested
alert
but
she
coveted
rest
it
was
clear
that
he
also
recognized
her
and
something
in
her
wistful
eyes
recalled
the
words
had
spoken
have
you
found
the
father
presence
yet
he
asked
with
a
reverent
tone
to
his
voice
when
he
said
the
father
and
yet
with
such
evident
trust
and
love
that
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
she
answered
quickly
no
i
have
i
can
not
feel
that
he
is
my
father
they
went
down
the
steps
just
then
and
the
crowd
rushed
in
between
them
so
that
neither
knew
what
had
become
of
the
other
only
that
chance
meeting
he
might
never
see
her
again
chautauqua
was
peculiarly
a
place
where
people
met
for
a
moment
then
lost
each
other
perhaps
for
all
the
rest
of
the
time
i
may
never
see
her
again
evan
roberts
thought
but
i
am
glad
that
i
said
a
word
to
her
i
hope
in
my
soul
that
she
will
let
him
find
her
if
flossy
could
have
heard
this
unspoken
sentence
she
would
have
marveled
let
him
find
her
why
she
was
dimly
conscious
that
she
was
seeking
for
him
but
no
such
thought
had
presented
itself
as
that
god
was
really
seeking
after
her
she
went
on
still
falling
behind
and
trying
to
hide
the
rush
of
feeling
that
the
simple
question
had
called
forth
she
was
very
quiet
at
the
dinner
table
she
was
oblivious
to
steel
forks
or
the
want
of
spoons
these
things
that
had
hitherto
filled
her
life
and
looked
of
importance
to
her
had
strangely
dwindled
she
was
miserably
disappointed
she
had
looked
forward
to
chautauqua
as
a
place
where
she
could
have
such
a
nice
time
that
word
nice
was
a
favorite
with
her
and
surely
no
one
could
be
having
a
more
wretched
time
than
this
and
it
was
not
the
rain
either
over
which
she
had
been
miserable
all
day
yesterday
nor
her
cashmere
dress
she
did
care
in
the
least
now
whether
it
cleared
or
not
and
as
to
her
dress
she
had
torn
her
silk
twice
and
it
was
sadly
drabbled
but
she
did
not
even
care
for
that
she
wanted
what
alas
for
the
daughter
of
nominally
christian
parents
living
among
all
the
privileges
of
a
cultured
christian
society
she
not
know
what
the
calkins
had
one
eager
listener
if
he
could
have
picked
out
her
earnest
wistful
eyes
among
that
crowd
of
upturned
faces
he
would
have
let
old
socrates
go
and
given
himself
heart
and
soul
to
the
leading
of
this
groping
soul
into
the
light
as
it
was
he
hovered
around
it
touching
the
subject
here
and
there
thrilling
her
with
the
possibilities
stretching
out
before
her
but
he
was
thinking
of
and
talking
all
the
while
to
those
who
had
reached
after
and
secured
this
something
that
to
her
was
still
a
shadow
now
and
then
the
speaker
brought
the
quick
tears
to
her
eyes
as
he
referred
to
those
who
had
followed
the
teaching
of
his
lips
with
sympathetic
faces
and
answered
the
appeal
to
their
hearts
with
tears
but
her
tears
were
different
from
those
they
were
the
tears
of
a
sick
soul
longing
for
light
and
help
the
entire
party
ignored
the
evening
meeting
marion
declared
that
her
brain
whirled
now
so
great
had
been
the
mental
strain
ruth
was
loftily
indifferent
to
any
plan
that
could
be
gotten
up
and
eurie
wits
were
ripe
for
mischief
flossy
opinion
of
course
was
not
asked
nobody
deeming
it
possible
that
she
could
have
the
slightest
desire
to
go
to
meeting
in
fact
eurie
put
their
desertion
on
the
ground
that
flossy
had
been
exhausted
by
the
mental
effort
of
the
day
and
needed
to
be
cheered
and
petted
she
on
her
part
was
silent
and
wearily
indifferent
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
her
heavy
heart
and
felt
that
she
might
as
soon
walk
down
by
the
lake
shore
as
do
anything
else
so
down
to
the
shore
they
went
and
gave
themselves
up
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
the
novel
scene
an
evening
in
the
woods
great
glowing
lights
on
every
side
great
companies
of
people
passing
to
and
fro
boats
touching
at
the
wharves
and
sending
up
group
after
group
to
the
central
attraction
the
grand
stand
singing
music
by
thousands
of
voices
ringing
down
to
them
as
they
loitered
under
the
trees
on
the
rustic
seats
i
declare
it
must
be
nice
in
heaven
for
a
little
while
it
was
eurie
who
made
this
somewhat
startling
discovery
and
announcement
after
a
lull
had
fallen
upon
their
mirth
have
you
been
there
to
see
illogically
asked
marion
as
she
threw
a
tiny
stone
into
the
water
and
watched
the
waves
quiver
and
ripple
eurie
laughed
not
quite
but
this
must
be
a
little
piece
of
it
this
music
i
mean
i
am
almost
tempted
to
make
an
effort
after
the
real
thing
how
exquisitely
those
voices
sound
i
very
certain
i
should
enjoy
the
music
whether
i
should
be
able
to
get
along
with
the
rest
of
the
programme
or
not
what
on
earth
do
you
suppose
they
do
there
all
the
time
anyway
where
why
in
heaven
of
course
that
is
what
i
was
talking
about
i
believe
you
are
half
asleep
flossy
shipley
you
must
go
to
sleep
out
here
it
is
quite
heaven
yet
and
you
will
take
cold
honestly
girls
is
it
a
sort
of
wonderment
to
you
how
the
people
up
there
can
employ
their
time
in
spite
of
me
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
it
must
be
rather
stupid
think
of
never
being
able
to
lie
down
and
take
a
nap
or
read
a
novel
added
marion
is
that
your
favorite
employment
when
you
are
awake
eurie
i
sure
i
do
know
much
about
the
occupations
of
the
place
i
not
posted
there
is
nothing
about
it
laid
down
in
our
geography
and
in
fact
the
people
who
seem
to
be
expecting
to
spend
their
lives
there
are
unaccountably
mum
about
it
i
do
at
this
moment
remember
hearing
any
one
ever
express
a
downright
opinion
and
i
have
always
thought
it
rather
queer
i
asked
nellie
wheden
about
it
one
day
when
she
was
going
on
about
her
expected
tour
in
europe
she
had
bored
me
to
death
making
me
produce
all
my
geographic
and
historic
lore
for
her
benefit
and
suddenly
i
thought
of
an
expedient
for
giving
myself
a
little
peace
and
a
chance
to
talk
about
something
else
nellie
i
said
good
turn
deserves
another
i
have
told
you
everything
i
can
think
of
that
can
possibly
be
of
interest
to
you
about
europe
now
give
me
some
information
about
the
other
place
where
you
are
going
you
must
have
laid
up
a
large
stock
of
information
in
all
these
years
what
on
earth
did
she
say
ruth
asked
curiously
while
eurie
was
in
great
glee
over
the
story
she
was
as
puzzled
as
if
i
had
spoken
to
her
in
greek
in
the
world
can
you
be
talking
about
she
said
not
going
anywhere
else
that
i
know
of
my
head
has
been
full
of
europe
for
the
last
year
and
i
have
talked
nor
thought
about
any
other
journey
well
i
enlightened
her
as
to
her
expectations
and
what
do
you
think
she
said
you
be
able
to
guess
so
i
tell
you
she
said
i
was
irreverent
and
that
no
one
who
respected
religion
would
ask
such
questions
as
that
and
she
actually
went
off
in
a
huff
over
my
wickedness
so
naturally
i
have
been
chary
of
trying
to
get
information
on
such
subjects
ever
since
whereupon
all
these
silly
young
ladies
laughed
long
and
heartily
over
this
silly
talk
flossy
laughed
with
the
rest
partly
from
the
force
of
habit
and
partly
because
this
recital
struck
her
as
very
foolish
every
one
of
them
saw
its
inconsistent
side
as
plainly
as
though
they
had
been
christians
for
years
more
plainly
perhaps
for
it
is
very
strange
what
blinded
eyes
we
can
get
under
certain
systems
of
living
the
religious
faith
presently
the
society
of
these
young
ladies
palled
upon
themselves
and
they
agreed
one
with
another
that
they
had
been
very
silly
not
to
go
to
meeting
and
that
another
evening
they
would
at
least
discover
what
was
being
said
before
they
lost
the
opportunity
for
getting
seats
stupid
set
said
eurie
who
imagined
that
the
crowd
would
do
such
a
silly
thing
as
to
rush
to
that
meeting
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
go
flying
off
for
a
seat
the
moment
the
bell
rings
i
thought
there
would
be
crowds
out
here
and
we
would
make
some
pleasant
acquaintances
and
perhaps
get
a
chance
to
take
a
boat
ride
and
so
in
some
disgust
they
voted
to
bring
the
first
day
at
chautauqua
to
a
sudden
close
and
try
tent
life
silence
and
darkness
reigned
in
the
tent
where
our
girls
had
disposed
of
themselves
it
was
two
hours
since
they
had
come
in
it
took
more
than
an
hour
and
much
talking
and
more
laughter
not
to
mention
considerable
grumbling
on
ruth
part
before
everything
was
arranged
to
their
satisfaction
or
as
ruth
expressed
it
to
their
endurance
for
the
night
three
of
the
girls
were
sleeping
quietly
their
fun
and
their
discontents
alike
forgotten
but
flossy
tossed
wearily
on
her
bed
turned
her
pillow
and
turned
it
back
again
and
sought
in
vain
for
a
quiet
spot
with
the
silence
and
the
darkness
her
unrest
had
come
upon
her
again
with
tenfold
force
she
felt
no
nearer
a
solution
of
her
trouble
than
she
had
in
the
morning
in
fact
the
pain
had
deepened
all
day
and
the
only
definite
feeling
she
had
about
it
now
was
that
she
could
not
live
so
that
something
must
be
done
that
she
must
get
back
to
her
home
and
her
old
life
where
she
might
hope
to
forged
it
all
and
be
at
peace
again
into
the
quiet
of
the
night
came
a
firm
manly
step
and
the
movement
of
chairs
right
by
her
side
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
her
all
unused
to
tent
life
as
she
was
a
good
deal
startled
she
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
and
looked
about
her
in
a
frightened
way
before
she
realized
that
the
sounds
came
from
the
tent
next
to
theirs
before
her
thoughts
were
fairly
composed
they
were
startled
anew
this
time
with
the
voice
of
prayer
very
distinct
the
words
were
on
this
still
night
air
every
sentence
as
clear
as
though
it
had
really
been
spoken
in
the
same
tent
now
there
was
something
peculiar
in
the
voice
clearly
cut
and
rounded
the
words
were
like
that
of
a
man
very
decided
very
positive
in
his
views
and
very
earnest
in
his
life
there
was
also
a
modulation
to
the
syllables
that
flossy
could
not
describe
but
that
she
felt
and
she
knew
that
she
had
heard
that
voice
twice
before
once
on
the
boat
the
evening
before
and
once
as
they
jostled
together
in
the
crowd
on
their
way
to
dinner
she
felt
sorry
to
be
unwittingly
a
listener
to
a
prayer
that
the
maker
evidently
thought
was
being
heard
only
by
his
savior
but
she
could
not
shut
out
the
low
and
yet
wonderfully
distinct
sentences
and
presently
she
ceased
to
wish
to
for
it
became
certain
that
he
was
praying
for
her
he
made
it
very
plain
he
called
her
that
young
girl
who
said
that
she
could
not
think
of
thee
as
her
father
who
seems
to
want
to
be
led
by
the
hand
to
thee
did
you
ever
hear
yourself
prayed
for
by
an
earnest
reverent
pleading
voice
then
perhaps
you
know
something
of
flossy
feelings
as
she
lay
there
in
the
darkness
she
had
never
heard
any
one
pray
for
her
before
so
destitute
was
she
of
real
friends
that
she
doubted
much
whether
there
were
one
person
living
who
had
ever
before
earnestly
asked
god
to
make
her
his
child
that
was
what
this
prayer
was
asking
she
lifted
the
white
sleeve
of
her
gown
and
wiped
away
tear
after
tear
as
the
pleading
voice
went
on
very
still
she
was
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
not
lose
a
syllable
of
the
prayer
for
here
at
last
was
the
help
she
had
been
seeking
blindly
and
without
knowing
that
she
sought
all
this
long
heavy
day
help
yes
plain
clear
simple
help
how
small
a
thing
it
seemed
to
do
show
her
her
need
of
thee
blessed
jesus
thus
the
prayer
ran
and
oh
he
showed
her
that
it
flashed
over
her
troubled
brain
then
and
there
it
is
jesus
that
i
need
it
is
he
who
can
help
me
i
believe
he
can
i
believe
he
is
the
only
one
who
can
this
was
her
confession
of
faith
then
lead
her
to
ask
the
help
of
thee
that
she
needs
just
to
come
to
thee
as
the
little
child
would
go
to
her
mother
and
say
take
me
make
me
thy
child
only
that
was
it
such
a
little
thing
to
do
how
wonderful
the
praying
ceased
and
the
young
man
who
had
remembered
the
stranger
to
whom
god
had
given
him
a
chance
to
speak
during
the
day
all
unconscious
that
other
ear
than
god
had
heard
his
words
of
prayer
laid
himself
down
to
quiet
sleep
flossy
lay
very
still
the
rain
had
ceased
during
the
afternoon
and
now
some
solemn
stars
were
peeping
in
through
the
chinks
in
the
tent
and
the
earth
was
she
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
and
looked
around
on
her
companions
how
soundly
asleep
they
were
another
few
minutes
of
stillness
and
irresolution
then
a
figure
slipped
softly
and
quietly
to
the
floor
and
on
her
knees
and
a
voice
repeated
again
and
again
these
words
jesus
take
me
make
me
thy
child
it
was
very
long
afterward
that
she
lay
quietly
down
on
her
pillow
and
earth
went
on
exactly
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
knew
nothing
at
all
about
it
even
the
sleeper
by
her
side
was
totally
ignorant
of
the
wonderful
tableau
that
had
been
acted
all
about
her
that
evening
but
if
eurie
mitchell
could
have
had
one
little
peep
into
heaven
just
then
what
her
entranced
soul
have
thought
of
the
music
and
the
enjoyment
there
for
what
it
be
like
when
there
is
joy
in
the
presence
of
the
angels
in
heaven
chapter
ix
fleeing
the
next
morning
every
one
of
them
ran
away
from
the
meeting
the
way
of
it
was
this
as
they
came
up
from
breakfast
and
stood
at
the
discussing
the
question
whether
they
would
go
to
the
early
meeting
duane
smithe
passed
glanced
up
at
them
carelessly
then
looked
back
curiously
and
at
last
turned
and
came
back
to
them
i
beg
pardon
she
said
but
is
this
miss
erskine
it
surely
is
i
thought
i
recognized
your
face
but
could
be
sure
in
these
strange
surroundings
and
you
have
a
party
with
you
how
delightful
we
were
just
wishing
for
more
ladies
i
really
do
think
it
is
going
to
rain
much
and
we
have
a
lovely
prospect
in
view
you
must
certainly
join
us
then
followed
introductions
and
explanations
duane
smithe
was
a
saratoga
acquaintance
of
ruth
erskine
and
was
for
jamestown
for
the
day
where
is
jamestown
queried
eurie
who
was
a
very
useful
member
of
society
in
that
she
never
pretended
knowledge
that
she
did
not
possess
so
that
you
had
only
to
keep
still
and
listen
to
the
answers
that
were
made
to
her
questions
in
order
to
know
a
good
deal
it
is
at
the
head
of
this
lovely
little
lake
or
at
the
foot
i
sure
i
do
know
which
way
to
call
it
and
it
is
nothing
of
consequence
of
course
but
the
ride
thither
is
said
to
be
charming
and
we
are
going
to
take
a
lunch
and
picnic
in
a
private
way
just
for
the
fun
of
getting
together
you
know
in
a
more
social
manner
than
one
can
accomplish
in
this
wilderness
of
people
is
it
a
queer
place
miss
erskine
i
am
dying
to
know
how
you
happened
to
come
here
ruth
arched
her
eyebrows
i
confess
it
is
almost
as
strange
as
what
brought
here
she
said
smiling
i
can
answer
that
in
an
instant
i
have
a
ridiculous
nephew
here
who
thought
that
a
week
of
meetings
from
morning
to
night
would
be
just
a
trifle
short
of
paradise
so
what
did
he
do
but
smuggle
us
all
off
this
way
i
shall
find
it
a
bore
of
course
and
the
only
way
to
get
through
with
it
is
to
have
little
pleasure
excursions
like
the
one
we
propose
now
you
know
as
much
about
duane
smithe
as
though
i
should
write
about
her
for
a
week
it
is
strange
how
little
we
have
to
say
before
we
have
explained
to
people
not
only
our
intellectual
but
our
moral
status
our
girls
you
will
remember
had
as
little
regard
for
the
meetings
as
girls
could
have
and
they
had
by
this
time
begun
to
feel
themselves
in
a
strange
atmosphere
without
acquaintances
or
gentlemanly
attentions
so
it
took
almost
no
persuasion
at
all
to
induce
them
to
join
smithe
party
composed
of
two
young
ladies
and
four
young
gentlemen
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
to
you
what
a
disappointment
the
decision
to
spend
the
day
in
frolic
instead
of
going
to
the
meetings
was
to
flossy
all
the
morning
her
heart
had
been
in
a
great
flutter
of
happiness
over
the
beautiful
day
that
stretched
out
before
her
to
meet
those
earnest
eager
people
again
to
hear
those
hymns
to
hear
the
voice
of
prayer
all
about
her
to
hear
the
constant
allusions
that
were
so
strange
and
so
saddening
to
her
yesterday
and
that
now
she
understood
how
blessed
it
would
be
she
had
gone
about
the
bewilderments
of
her
toilet
in
a
tent
with
a
serenely
happy
face
and
almost
unawares
had
hummed
the
refrain
of
a
tune
that
had
already
shown
itself
a
favorite
at
chautauqua
flossy
is
like
herself
this
morning
eurie
said
as
she
heard
the
happy
little
song
i
think
she
has
recovered
from
her
tents
are
not
convenient
places
in
which
to
make
private
remarks
flossy
overheard
this
one
and
smiled
to
herself
yes
she
had
gotten
over
her
she
had
found
home
she
gave
a
little
exclamation
of
dismay
as
she
heard
the
plannings
for
the
day
and
said
but
ruth
what
about
the
meetings
well
ruth
had
said
with
her
most
provokingly
nonchalant
air
i
have
made
any
inquiry
but
i
presume
they
will
continue
them
all
day
just
the
same
as
if
we
were
here
i
do
they
will
change
the
programme
on
our
account
and
eurie
had
added
mischievously
flossy
is
afraid
it
is
not
the
aristocratic
thing
to
do
not
to
stay
to
all
the
meetings
oh
as
to
that
smithe
had
said
she
was
one
of
those
interesting
people
who
always
take
remarks
seriously
i
assure
you
it
is
what
the
first
people
on
the
ground
are
doing
of
course
none
of
them
would
be
so
absurd
as
to
think
of
attending
meetings
all
the
time
the
brain
would
endure
such
a
strain
of
course
not
marion
had
answered
with
gravity
my
brain
is
already
very
tired
i
think
yours
must
be
exhausted
flossy
meditated
a
daring
resolution
to
stay
behind
and
take
her
rest
in
the
way
she
coveted
but
the
impossibility
of
explaining
what
would
appear
to
the
others
as
merely
an
freak
and
occasion
no
end
of
talk
deterred
her
and
with
slow
reluctant
steps
she
followed
the
merry
group
down
to
the
wharf
if
those
people
had
stopped
long
enough
to
think
of
it
this
disposal
of
themselves
would
have
had
its
ludicrous
side
certainly
it
was
a
strange
fancy
to
run
away
twenty
miles
with
lunches
done
up
in
paper
in
search
of
a
picnic
when
chautauqua
was
one
great
picnic
ground
stretching
out
before
them
in
beauty
and
convenience
but
the
entire
group
belonged
to
that
class
of
people
for
whom
the
fancy
of
the
moment
whatever
it
may
be
has
infinite
charms
there
was
plenty
of
room
on
the
colonel
phillips
very
few
people
were
traveling
in
that
direction
it
is
really
queer
the
captain
was
overheard
to
say
to
take
a
party
from
the
grounds
at
this
hour
of
the
day
what
an
enthusiastic
set
of
people
they
are
about
here
eurie
said
to
rawson
one
of
smithe
party
as
they
paced
the
deck
together
the
people
all
talk
and
act
as
though
there
was
nowhere
to
go
and
nothing
to
do
but
attend
those
meetings
for
my
part
it
is
a
real
relief
to
have
a
change
in
the
programme
do
you
find
it
so
he
asked
well
now
i
do
agree
with
you
i
think
this
proceeding
is
a
real
bore
my
respected
aunt
is
always
getting
up
absurd
freaks
and
this
is
one
of
them
and
the
worst
one
in
my
opinion
that
she
has
had
for
some
time
i
wanted
to
go
to
those
meetings
some
of
them
at
least
one
is
obliged
to
be
there
every
minute
but
it
looks
badly
to
run
away
eurie
eyed
him
closely
are
you
the
nephew
that
your
aunt
said
thought
these
meetings
only
a
step
below
paradise
she
asked
at
last
i
wonder
you
would
consent
to
come
rawson
flushed
deeply
i
am
not
the
nephew
at
all
he
said
trying
to
laugh
the
one
would
come
my
aunt
tried
all
her
powers
of
persuasion
on
him
in
vain
but
the
truth
is
her
eloquence
or
her
persistence
proved
too
much
for
me
though
i
do
like
the
looks
of
it
and
i
do
feel
the
pleasure
of
it
and
i
am
afraid
i
shall
make
anything
but
an
agreeable
addition
to
the
party
now
that
is
being
frank
is
it
when
i
am
walking
the
deck
with
a
young
lady
i
do
see
why
that
circumstance
should
make
it
a
surprising
thing
that
you
are
frank
but
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
perhaps
you
might
prevail
on
the
captain
to
put
you
off
now
and
let
you
swim
back
you
could
get
there
in
time
for
the
sermon
is
there
to
be
a
sermon
what
it
you
are
so
anxious
to
hear
all
of
it
he
said
gloomily
i
beg
your
pardon
for
being
in
so
disagreeable
a
mood
it
is
defrauding
you
out
of
some
of
your
expected
pleasure
to
have
a
dismal
companion
but
as
i
have
commenced
by
being
frank
i
may
as
well
continue
i
am
dissatisfied
with
myself
i
ought
not
to
have
come
on
this
excursion
the
truth
is
i
meant
to
make
chautauqua
a
help
to
me
i
need
the
help
badly
enough
i
am
in
the
rush
and
whirl
of
business
all
the
time
at
home
this
is
the
only
two
weeks
in
the
year
that
i
am
free
and
i
wanted
to
make
it
a
great
spiritual
help
to
me
i
know
very
well
that
merely
hovering
around
in
such
an
atmosphere
as
that
at
chautauqua
is
a
help
to
the
christian
and
i
came
with
the
full
intention
of
taking
in
all
that
i
could
get
of
this
sort
of
inspiration
and
it
chafes
me
that
so
early
in
the
meeting
i
have
been
led
away
against
my
inclinations
by
a
little
pressure
that
i
might
have
resisted
and
done
no
harm
to
any
one
my
cousin
had
the
same
sort
of
influence
brought
to
bear
on
him
and
it
had
no
more
effect
on
him
than
it
would
on
a
stone
he
stopped
and
seemed
to
give
eurie
a
chance
to
answer
but
she
was
not
inclined
and
he
added
as
if
he
had
just
thought
his
words
an
implied
reproach
i
can
understand
how
to
you
young
ladies
of
comparative
leisure
with
plenty
of
time
to
cultivate
the
spiritual
side
of
your
natures
it
should
seem
an
unnecessary
and
perhaps
a
wearisome
thing
to
attend
all
these
meetings
but
you
can
not
understand
what
it
is
to
be
in
the
whirl
of
business
life
never
having
time
to
think
hardly
having
time
to
pray
and
to
get
away
from
it
all
and
go
to
heaven
as
it
were
for
a
fortnight
is
something
to
be
coveted
by
us
as
a
great
help
once
more
he
waited
for
eurie
answer
but
it
was
very
different
from
what
he
had
seemed
to
expect
you
might
just
as
well
talk
to
me
in
the
greek
language
i
should
understand
quite
as
well
what
you
have
been
saying
i
do
think
any
spiritual
side
to
my
nature
at
least
it
has
never
been
cultivated
if
i
have
and
chautauqua
to
me
is
just
the
place
in
which
to
have
a
good
free
easy
time
go
where
i
like
and
stay
as
long
as
i
like
and
for
once
in
my
life
not
be
bound
by
conventional
forms
if
heaven
is
anything
like
that
i
should
object
to
it
but
i
sure
your
and
my
idea
of
it
would
differ
there
i
been
frank
now
and
shocked
you
i
know
i
see
it
in
every
line
of
your
face
poor
fellow
i
know
what
you
will
do
for
there
is
a
single
one
of
us
who
has
the
least
idea
what
you
mean
by
that
sort
of
talk
unless
you
have
some
young
ladies
of
a
different
type
in
your
party
and
from
their
manner
i
rather
doubt
it
she
had
shocked
him
he
looked
not
only
pained
but
puzzled
i
am
very
sorry
he
stammered
i
mean
surprised
yes
and
disappointed
of
course
i
am
that
i
think
i
had
imagined
that
it
was
only
christians
who
could
be
attracted
to
chautauqua
at
all
i
meant
to
come
to
stay
through
all
the
services
your
aunt
for
instance
eurie
said
inquiringly
my
aunt
is
a
christian
he
answered
and
a
sincere
one
too
though
i
see
for
some
reason
you
do
think
so
there
are
degrees
in
christianity
miss
mitchell
just
as
there
are
in
amiability
or
culture
or
beauty
mr
rawson
called
a
voice
from
the
other
end
at
this
moment
and
he
in
obedience
to
the
call
found
eurie
a
seat
near
some
of
her
party
and
went
away
only
stopping
to
say
in
low
tones
i
am
sorry
it
is
all
to
you
you
would
enjoy
understanding
it
i
am
sure
it
so
happened
that
those
two
people
did
not
exchange
another
word
together
that
day
but
eurie
had
got
her
thrust
when
and
where
she
least
expected
it
she
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
not
a
single
fanatic
was
of
their
party
in
the
secret
of
her
wise
heart
she
denominated
all
the
earnest
people
at
chautauqua
fanatics
and
all
the
people
hypocrites
only
she
who
stood
outside
and
felt
nothing
was
sincere
and
wise
meantime
marion
had
undertaken
a
strange
task
charlie
flint
was
the
gentleman
who
had
drawn
his
chair
near
her
and
said
as
he
drew
a
long
breath
it
is
exceedingly
pleasant
to
breathe
air
once
more
that
is
heavy
with
psalm
singing
i
think
they
are
running
that
thing
a
little
too
steep
over
there
who
imagined
that
they
were
going
to
have
meeting
every
minute
in
the
day
and
evening
and
give
nobody
a
chance
to
breathe
have
they
exhausted
you
already
marion
asked
let
me
see
this
is
the
morning
of
the
second
day
is
it
not
oh
as
to
myself
i
was
exhausted
before
i
commenced
it
i
am
only
speaking
a
word
for
the
lunatics
who
think
they
enjoy
it
i
am
one
of
the
victims
to
our
cousin
whim
he
expects
to
get
me
converted
here
i
think
or
something
of
that
sort
i
would
be
afraid
of
it
marion
said
in
disgust
i
do
believe
there
is
the
least
danger
charlie
chose
to
consider
this
as
a
compliment
and
bowed
and
smiled
and
said
thanks
now
tell
me
why
please
you
do
look
like
that
class
of
people
who
are
affected
in
that
way
he
was
wonderfully
interested
and
begged
at
once
to
know
why
marion
had
it
in
her
heart
to
say
because
they
all
look
as
though
they
had
some
degree
of
brain
as
well
as
body
but
even
she
had
a
little
regard
left
for
feelings
so
she
contented
herself
with
saying
savagely
oh
they
as
a
rule
are
the
sort
of
people
who
think
there
is
something
in
life
worth
doing
and
planning
for
and
you
look
as
though
that
would
be
too
much
trouble
now
charlie
by
no
means
liked
to
be
considered
devoid
of
energy
so
he
said
oh
you
mistake
i
think
there
are
several
things
worth
doing
but
this
eternal
going
to
meeting
and
whining
over
one
soul
is
not
to
my
taste
you
think
that
it
is
more
worth
your
while
to
take
ladies
out
to
ride
and
walk
and
carry
their
parasols
and
muffs
for
them
and
things
of
that
sort
since
we
are
made
for
the
purpose
of
staying
here
and
showing
our
fine
clothes
for
all
eternity
of
course
it
is
foolish
to
have
anything
to
do
with
one
soul
that
can
only
last
for
a
few
years
or
so
she
hardly
realized
herself
the
intense
scorn
there
was
in
her
voice
and
as
for
charlie
flint
he
muttered
to
himself
upon
my
word
she
is
one
of
them
of
the
bitterest
sort
too
what
in
creation
is
she
doing
here
why
did
she
stay
there
and
preach
chapter
x
how
the
flitting
ended
as
for
ruth
erskine
if
she
had
been
asked
whether
she
was
enjoying
the
day
she
would
hardly
have
known
what
answer
to
make
she
could
not
even
tell
why
the
excursion
was
not
in
every
respect
all
that
it
had
promised
in
the
morning
she
had
no
realization
of
how
much
the
atmosphere
of
the
day
before
lingered
around
her
and
made
her
notice
the
contrast
between
the
people
of
yesterday
and
the
people
of
smithe
if
she
were
a
christian
as
her
nephew
insisted
was
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
specimens
of
that
class
for
ruth
erskine
to
meet
because
she
was
a
woman
who
entered
into
pleasure
and
fashion
and
entertainments
of
all
sorts
with
zest
and
energy
and
only
in
matters
of
religious
interest
seemed
to
lose
all
life
and
zeal
now
ruth
erskine
calm
as
a
summer
morning
herself
over
all
matters
pertaining
to
the
souls
of
people
in
general
and
her
own
in
particular
was
yet
exceedingly
fond
of
seeing
other
people
act
in
a
manner
that
she
chose
to
consider
consistent
with
their
belief
therefore
she
despised
smithe
for
what
she
was
pleased
to
term
her
hypocrisy
at
the
same
time
while
at
saratoga
she
had
quite
enjoyed
her
society
they
rode
together
on
fine
mornings
sipped
their
congress
together
before
lunch
and
attended
hops
together
in
the
evenings
now
the
reason
why
smithe
society
had
so
suddenly
palled
upon
her
and
the
words
that
she
was
pleased
to
call
conversation
become
such
vapid
things
ruth
did
not
know
and
did
not
for
one
instant
attribute
to
chautauqua
and
yet
that
meeting
had
already
stamped
its
impression
upon
her
from
serene
indifferent
heights
she
liked
to
look
down
upon
and
admire
earnestness
therefore
chautauqua
despite
all
her
disgust
over
the
common
surroundings
and
awkward
accommodations
had
pleased
her
fancy
and
arrested
her
attention
more
than
she
herself
realized
it
was
her
fate
to
be
thrown
almost
constantly
with
smithe
during
the
day
and
before
the
afternoon
closed
she
was
surfeited
she
heartily
wished
herself
back
to
the
grounds
and
found
herself
wondering
what
they
were
singing
and
whether
the
service
of
song
was
really
very
interesting
one
episode
in
her
day
had
interested
her
and
she
could
not
tell
whether
it
had
most
amused
or
annoyed
her
one
of
their
party
was
conversing
with
a
gentleman
as
she
came
up
she
had
just
time
to
observe
that
he
was
young
and
when
the
two
turned
to
her
and
she
was
introduced
to
the
stranger
you
are
from
chautauqua
he
said
speaking
rapidly
and
earnestly
grand
meeting
is
it
going
to
be
better
than
last
year
i
think
were
you
there
no
then
you
do
know
what
a
treat
you
are
to
have
i
very
sorry
to
lose
it
has
been
a
good
day
i
know
the
programme
was
rich
but
a
matter
of
business
made
it
necessary
to
be
away
it
is
unfortunate
for
me
that
i
am
so
near
home
if
i
were
two
or
three
hundred
miles
away
where
the
business
could
reach
me
i
should
get
more
benefit
miss
erskine
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
direct
spiritual
results
of
this
gathering
i
do
not
mean
upon
christians
no
one
of
course
can
doubt
its
happy
influence
upon
our
hearts
and
lives
but
i
mean
are
you
hopeful
as
to
the
reaching
of
many
of
the
unconverted
or
do
you
consider
its
work
chiefly
among
us
such
a
volley
of
words
they
fairly
poured
forth
and
the
speaker
was
so
intensely
in
earnest
and
so
assured
in
his
use
of
that
word
we
as
if
it
were
a
matter
that
was
entirely
beyond
question
that
she
was
one
of
the
magic
we
she
did
not
know
how
to
set
out
to
work
to
enlighten
him
in
fact
she
gave
little
thought
to
that
part
of
the
matter
but
instead
fell
to
wondering
what
her
idea
whether
she
did
expect
to
see
results
of
any
sort
from
the
great
gathering
and
that
being
the
case
what
she
expected
spiritual
results
she
said
to
herself
and
a
smile
hovered
over
her
face
what
spiritual
results
she
knew
nothing
about
them
there
any
such
things
eurie
mitchell
had
such
a
question
occurred
to
her
would
have
asked
it
aloud
at
once
and
enjoyed
the
sense
of
shocking
her
auditor
but
ruth
did
not
like
to
shock
people
she
was
too
much
of
a
lady
for
that
what
proportion
of
that
class
of
people
are
here
do
you
think
she
said
at
last
are
not
the
most
of
them
professing
christians
precisely
the
question
that
interests
me
i
should
really
like
to
know
i
wonder
if
there
is
no
way
of
coming
at
it
we
might
call
for
a
rising
vote
of
all
who
loved
the
lord
could
we
not
would
it
be
a
beautiful
sight
a
great
army
standing
up
for
him
i
incline
to
your
opinion
that
the
most
of
them
are
christians
or
at
least
a
large
proportion
but
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
just
how
far
this
idea
had
touched
the
popular
heart
so
as
to
call
out
those
who
are
not
on
the
lord
side
they
would
simply
have
come
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
or
the
novelty
of
it
she
said
feeling
amused
again
that
almost
of
necessity
she
was
speaking
of
herself
and
using
the
pronoun
they
what
would
this
gentleman
think
if
he
should
bring
about
that
vote
of
which
he
spoke
and
happen
to
see
her
among
the
seated
ones
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
he
would
suppose
me
to
be
she
said
to
herself
but
i
am
sure
i
have
not
told
him
that
i
belong
to
the
at
all
if
he
chooses
to
assume
things
in
that
way
it
is
not
my
fault
apparently
he
answered
both
her
expressed
sentence
and
her
thought
i
do
not
think
so
he
said
earnestly
i
doubt
if
any
have
come
simply
for
fun
or
for
novelty
there
are
better
places
in
which
to
gratify
both
tastes
i
believe
there
is
more
actual
interest
in
this
subject
even
among
the
unconverted
than
many
seem
to
think
they
are
reasonable
beings
they
must
think
and
many
of
them
no
doubt
think
to
good
purpose
it
may
not
be
clear
even
to
themselves
for
what
they
have
come
but
i
believe
in
some
instances
to
say
the
least
it
will
prove
to
have
been
the
call
of
the
spirit
again
ruth
felt
herself
forced
to
smile
not
at
the
earnestness
she
liked
that
but
there
was
her
party
and
she
rapidly
reviewed
them
marion
with
her
calm
composed
skeptical
views
indifferent
alike
to
the
christian
or
unchristian
way
of
doing
things
eurie
who
lived
and
breathed
for
the
purpose
of
having
what
in
wild
moments
she
called
a
high
time
flossy
with
her
dainty
wardrobe
and
her
dainty
ways
and
her
indifference
to
everything
that
demanded
thought
or
care
which
of
them
had
been
called
by
the
spirit
there
was
herself
and
for
the
time
she
gave
a
little
start
what
had
come
to
chautauqua
for
after
all
she
was
the
only
one
who
seemed
to
be
absolutely
without
a
reason
for
being
there
marion
avowed
intention
had
been
to
make
some
money
eurie
to
have
a
free
and
easy
time
flossy
had
come
as
she
did
everything
else
because
they
did
but
now
what
about
ruth
erskine
she
was
not
wont
to
do
as
others
did
unless
it
happened
to
please
her
what
had
been
her
motive
it
was
strange
to
feel
that
she
really
did
not
know
what
if
this
strange
speaking
young
man
were
right
and
she
had
been
singled
out
by
the
spirit
of
god
the
thought
gave
her
a
thrill
not
of
pleasure
but
of
absolute
nervous
fear
what
did
she
know
of
that
gracious
spirit
what
did
she
know
of
christ
to
her
there
was
no
beauty
in
him
she
desired
simply
to
be
left
alone
she
was
silent
so
long
that
her
companion
gave
her
a
very
searching
review
from
under
his
heavy
eyebrows
and
then
his
face
suddenly
lighted
as
if
he
had
solved
a
problem
may
i
venture
to
prophesy
that
you
have
some
friend
here
whom
you
would
give
much
to
feel
had
been
drawn
here
by
the
very
spirit
of
god
he
spoke
the
words
eagerly
and
with
earnestness
but
with
utmost
respect
and
added
if
i
am
right
i
will
add
the
name
to
my
list
for
special
prayer
do
not
think
me
rude
please
i
know
how
pleasant
it
is
to
feel
there
is
a
union
of
desire
in
prayer
i
have
enjoyed
that
help
often
we
do
not
always
need
to
know
who
those
are
for
whom
we
pray
god
knows
them
and
that
is
the
needful
thing
i
am
glad
to
have
met
you
it
is
pleasant
to
have
additions
to
our
list
of
how
bright
his
smile
was
as
he
said
those
words
and
how
thoroughly
manly
and
yet
how
strikingly
childlike
had
been
his
words
and
his
trust
ruth
watched
him
as
he
walked
rapidly
away
to
overtake
a
friend
who
had
just
passed
them
do
you
remember
a
certain
gentleman
harold
wayne
by
name
who
had
walked
with
them
walked
especially
with
ruth
down
to
the
depot
on
the
morning
of
departure
who
had
toyed
with
her
fan
and
complained
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
they
were
going
to
bury
themselves
out
there
for
ruth
thought
of
him
now
and
the
contrast
between
his
lazily
exquisite
air
and
drawling
words
and
the
fresh
earnest
life
that
glowed
in
this
young
man
veins
brought
a
positive
quiver
of
disgust
over
her
handsome
face
there
was
no
shadow
of
a
smile
upon
it
now
instead
she
felt
a
nameless
dread
how
strange
the
talk
had
been
to
what
had
she
committed
herself
by
her
silence
and
his
blunders
pray
for
any
one
what
a
queer
thing
that
would
be
to
do
anxious
that
any
one
should
be
led
by
the
spirit
of
god
the
spirit
of
god
frightened
her
for
whom
would
this
young
man
pray
not
certainly
for
any
friend
of
hers
yet
he
would
put
the
name
of
some
stranger
in
his
prayers
he
was
thoroughly
in
earnest
and
he
was
the
sort
of
a
man
to
do
just
what
he
said
god
he
had
said
would
understand
whom
he
meant
for
whom
would
god
count
those
prayers
for
her
and
that
thought
also
frightened
her
they
are
all
lunatics
i
verily
believe
from
the
leaders
to
the
followers
she
said
in
irritation
and
then
she
wished
herself
at
home
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
she
was
engaged
in
trying
to
shake
off
the
impression
that
the
stranger
had
left
upon
her
go
where
she
would
say
what
she
might
and
she
really
exerted
herself
to
be
brilliant
and
entertaining
there
followed
her
around
the
memory
of
those
great
earnest
eyes
when
he
said
i
will
add
the
name
to
my
list
for
special
prayer
what
name
he
knew
hers
he
would
say
doubtless
her
friend
for
whom
she
was
anxious
but
the
one
to
whom
he
prayed
would
know
there
was
no
such
person
what
would
do
with
that
earnest
prayer
for
she
knew
it
would
be
earnest
she
was
not
used
to
theological
mazes
and
if
ever
a
girl
was
heartily
glad
when
a
day
of
pleasuring
was
over
and
the
boat
had
touched
again
at
the
chautauqua
wharf
it
was
ruth
erskine
as
for
flossy
it
so
happened
that
charlie
flint
after
marion
had
startled
and
disgusted
him
sought
refuge
with
her
she
was
pretty
and
dainty
and
did
not
look
not
in
the
least
as
if
her
forte
was
to
preach
so
he
made
ready
to
have
a
running
fire
of
small
talk
with
her
this
had
been
flossy
power
in
conversation
for
several
years
he
had
judged
her
rightly
there
but
do
you
remember
with
whom
her
morning
had
commenced
do
you
know
that
all
the
day
thus
far
she
had
seemed
to
herself
to
be
shadowed
by
a
glorious
presence
who
walked
steadily
beside
her
before
her
on
either
hand
to
shield
and
help
and
bless
it
was
very
sweet
to
flossy
and
she
was
very
happy
happier
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
she
smiled
to
herself
as
the
others
chatted
she
hummed
in
undertone
the
refrain
of
a
hymn
that
she
had
caught
in
a
near
tent
that
morning
i
am
so
glad
that
jesus
loves
me
she
glad
was
there
anything
better
to
find
in
all
this
world
than
the
assurance
of
this
truth
she
felt
that
the
thought
was
large
enough
to
fill
heaven
itself
after
that
what
hope
was
there
for
charlie
flint
and
his
small
talk
still
he
tried
it
and
if
ever
he
did
hard
work
it
was
during
that
talk
flossy
was
sweet
and
cheery
but
preoccupied
there
was
a
tantalizingly
pleasant
smile
on
her
face
as
if
her
thoughts
might
be
full
of
beauty
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
appear
in
her
words
she
did
not
flush
over
his
compliments
nor
was
she
disturbed
at
his
bantering
he
got
out
of
all
patience
i
beg
pardon
he
said
in
his
flippantly
gallant
way
but
inclined
to
think
you
are
very
selfish
you
are
having
your
enjoyment
all
to
yourself
to
judge
by
the
face
which
you
have
worn
all
day
your
heart
is
bubbling
over
with
it
and
yet
you
think
about
it
instead
of
giving
me
a
bit
flossy
looked
up
with
a
shy
sweet
smile
that
was
very
pleasant
to
see
and
the
first
blush
he
had
been
able
to
call
forth
that
day
glowed
on
her
cheeks
was
it
true
she
questioned
within
herself
was
she
being
selfish
in
this
her
new
joy
ought
she
to
try
to
tell
him
about
it
would
he
understand
and
could
she
speak
about
such
things
anyway
she
did
know
how
she
shrank
from
it
and
yet
perhaps
it
would
be
so
pleasant
to
him
to
know
no
on
the
whole
she
did
not
think
it
would
be
pleasant
they
had
not
talked
of
the
meetings
nor
of
religious
matters
at
all
but
for
all
that
the
subtle
magnetism
that
there
is
about
some
people
had
told
her
that
charlie
flint
would
not
sympathize
in
her
new
hopes
and
joys
well
if
that
were
so
ought
she
not
all
the
more
to
tell
him
so
that
he
might
know
that
to
one
more
person
christ
had
proved
himself
a
reality
and
not
the
spiritual
fancy
that
he
used
to
seem
to
her
flossy
you
see
was
taking
long
strides
that
first
day
of
her
christian
experience
and
was
reaching
farther
than
some
christians
reach
who
have
been
practicing
for
years
something
told
her
that
here
was
a
chance
of
witnessing
for
the
one
who
had
just
saved
her
she
thought
these
thoughts
much
more
quickly
than
it
has
taken
me
to
write
them
and
then
she
spoke
have
i
been
selfish
i
do
not
know
but
i
have
it
is
all
so
utterly
new
that
i
hardly
know
how
i
am
acting
but
it
is
true
that
my
heart
has
been
as
light
as
a
bird
all
day
the
truth
is
i
have
found
a
friend
here
at
chautauqua
who
has
just
satisfied
me
have
you
indeed
said
charlie
giving
in
spite
of
his
effort
to
quell
it
an
amused
little
laugh
and
in
his
heart
he
said
what
a
ridiculous
little
mouse
she
is
i
wonder
if
they
have
the
wedding
day
set
already
and
if
she
will
announce
it
to
me
then
aloud
how
very
fortunate
you
have
been
i
wish
i
could
find
a
friend
so
easily
as
that
i
wonder
if
i
am
acquainted
with
him
would
you
mind
telling
me
his
name
and
then
flossy
answered
just
one
word
in
a
low
voice
that
was
tremulous
with
feeling
and
at
the
same
time
wonderfully
clear
and
with
a
touch
of
joy
in
it
that
would
not
be
suppressed
jesus
then
it
was
that
the
exquisite
young
fop
at
her
side
was
utterly
dumbfounded
he
could
not
remember
ever
before
in
his
life
being
so
completely
taken
by
surprise
and
dismay
that
he
had
not
a
word
to
answer
but
this
time
he
said
not
a
single
word
he
did
not
even
attempt
an
answer
but
paced
the
length
of
the
deck
beside
her
in
utter
and
confused
silence
then
abruptly
seated
her
still
in
silence
and
went
hurriedly
away
flossy
occupied
with
the
rush
of
feeling
that
this
first
witnessing
for
the
new
name
called
forth
gave
little
heed
to
his
manner
and
was
indifferent
to
his
departure
he
was
right
as
to
one
thing
her
love
was
still
selfish
it
was
so
new
and
sweet
to
her
that
it
occupied
all
her
heart
and
left
no
room
as
yet
for
the
outside
world
who
knew
not
this
friend
of
hers
they
were
almost
at
the
dock
now
and
the
glimmer
of
the
chautauqua
lights
was
growing
into
a
steady
brightness
as
she
stood
leaning
over
the
boat
side
and
watching
the
play
of
the
silver
waves
there
brushed
past
her
one
who
seemed
to
be
very
quietly
busy
one
hand
was
full
of
little
leaflets
and
he
was
dropping
one
on
each
chair
and
stool
as
he
passed
she
glanced
at
the
one
nearest
her
and
read
the
title
the
true
friend
and
it
brought
an
instant
flush
of
brightness
to
her
face
to
understand
those
words
and
feel
that
the
friend
was
hers
then
she
glanced
at
the
worker
and
recognized
his
face
he
had
prayed
for
her
she
could
not
forget
face
it
was
plain
also
that
his
eyes
fell
on
her
he
knew
her
and
something
in
her
face
prompted
the
sentence
as
he
paused
before
her
you
have
found
the
father
i
think
and
flossy
with
brightening
eyes
answered
quickly
yes
i
have
and
then
the
boat
touched
at
the
wharf
and
the
crowd
elbowed
their
way
out
there
were
two
opinions
expressed
about
that
excursion
by
two
gentlemen
as
they
made
their
way
up
the
avenue
one
of
the
gentleman
was
clerical
and
spectacled
and
solemn
there
go
a
of
excursionists
he
said
to
his
companion
they
come
as
likely
as
not
delegates
from
some
church
or
and
the
way
they
do
their
work
is
to
go
off
for
a
frolic
and
be
gone
all
day
i
saw
them
when
i
left
this
morning
that
is
a
specimen
of
a
good
deal
of
the
dissipation
that
is
going
on
here
under
the
guise
of
religion
i
do
know
about
it
sometimes
i
am
afraid
more
harm
than
good
will
be
done
the
other
speaker
was
charlie
flint
and
as
he
rushed
past
these
two
he
said
to
companion
confound
it
all
talk
about
getting
away
from
these
meetings
it
no
use
it
ca
be
done
a
fellow
might
just
as
well
stay
here
and
run
every
time
the
bell
rings
i
heard
more
preaching
on
this
excursion
than
i
did
yesterday
and
a
good
deal
more
astonishing
preaching
too
chapter
xi
heart
touches
marion
gave
her
hair
an
energetic
twist
as
she
made
her
toilet
the
next
morning
and
announced
her
determination
this
day
is
to
be
devoted
conscientiously
to
the
legitimate
business
that
brought
me
to
this
region
yesterday
report
will
have
to
be
copied
from
the
buffalo
papers
or
made
out
of
my
own
brain
but
going
to
work
i
have
a
special
interest
in
the
programme
for
this
morning
the
subject
for
the
lecture
just
suits
me
what
is
it
eurie
asked
yawning
and
wishing
there
was
another
picnic
in
progress
neither
heart
nor
brain
were
particularly
interested
in
chautauqua
why
it
is
press
and
the
of
course
the
press
attracts
me
as
i
intend
to
belong
to
the
staff
when
i
get
through
teaching
young
ideas
but
what
about
the
ruth
questioned
with
a
calm
voice
you
can
not
be
expected
to
have
any
special
interest
in
that
you
never
go
to
such
an
institution
do
you
i
was
born
and
brought
up
in
one
but
that
is
the
point
the
subject
is
literature
i
take
it
the
subject
is
strung
together
press
and
the
without
any
periods
between
them
and
i
exceedingly
interested
in
that
for
just
as
soon
as
i
get
time
i
going
to
write
a
book
this
announcement
called
forth
bursts
of
laughter
from
all
the
girls
why
not
marion
said
answering
the
laugh
i
hope
you
do
intimate
that
i
ca
do
it
i
do
know
anything
easier
to
do
you
just
have
to
gather
together
the
most
improbable
set
of
girls
and
boys
and
rack
your
brains
for
things
that
they
never
do
or
do
or
to
do
and
paste
them
all
together
with
a
little
talk
and
you
have
your
book
as
orthodox
as
possible
do
any
of
you
know
anything
about
walden
he
is
the
speaker
i
presume
he
is
as
dry
as
a
stick
and
wo
give
me
a
single
idea
that
i
can
weave
into
my
book
i
going
to
begin
it
right
away
girls
i
going
to
put
you
all
in
only
i
ca
decide
which
shall
be
the
good
one
flossy
do
you
suppose
there
is
enough
imagination
in
me
to
make
you
into
a
book
saint
they
always
have
a
saint
you
know
there
was
a
pretty
flush
on
flossy
cheek
but
she
answered
brightly
you
might
try
marion
and
i
engage
to
practice
on
the
character
if
it
is
really
and
truly
a
good
one
i
had
a
glimpse
of
walden
eurie
said
answering
the
question
he
was
pointed
out
to
me
yesterday
he
looked
dignified
enough
to
write
a
theological
review
not
going
to
hear
him
what
the
use
i
came
for
fun
and
i
going
in
search
of
it
all
this
day
i
have
studied
the
programme
and
there
is
just
one
thing
that
i
going
to
attend
and
that
is
frank
beard
talk
i
know
that
will
be
capital
and
he
wo
bore
one
with
a
sermon
poked
in
every
two
minutes
so
the
party
divided
for
the
day
marion
and
ruth
went
to
the
stand
and
flossy
strayed
to
a
side
tent
and
what
happened
to
her
you
shall
presently
hear
eurie
wandered
at
her
fancy
and
enjoyed
a
stupid
time
so
she
reported
marion
pencil
moved
rapidly
over
the
paper
almost
as
soon
as
walden
commenced
until
presently
she
whispered
in
dismay
to
ruth
i
do
wish
he
would
say
something
to
leave
out
this
letter
will
be
fearfully
long
how
sharp
he
is
is
he
then
she
scribbled
again
ruth
had
the
benefit
of
many
side
remarks
my
marion
said
with
an
accompanying
grimace
what
an
army
of
books
all
for
three
millions
given
out
every
sunday
does
that
seem
possible
brother
hart
i
afraid
you
are
mistaken
did
he
say
that
was
hart
estimate
ruthie
there
is
certainly
a
good
chance
for
mine
if
so
many
are
needed
every
week
i
shall
have
to
go
right
to
work
at
it
what
if
i
write
one
ruth
and
what
if
it
should
and
all
the
millions
of
want
it
at
once
just
as
likely
as
not
i
am
a
genius
they
never
know
it
until
afterward
i
shall
certainly
put
you
in
ruthie
in
some
form
so
you
are
destined
to
immortality
remember
i
wish
you
would
whisper
so
much
whispered
back
ruth
people
are
looking
at
us
in
an
annoyed
way
what
is
the
matter
with
you
marion
i
never
knew
you
to
run
on
in
such
an
absurd
way
that
is
bad
enough
for
eurie
i
developing
whispered
marion
it
is
the
influence
of
chautauqua
that
you
hear
so
much
about
then
she
wrote
this
sentence
from
walden
lips
every
author
whose
books
go
into
the
is
as
much
a
teacher
in
that
school
as
though
he
had
classes
there
a
good
book
is
a
book
that
will
aid
the
teacher
in
his
work
of
bringing
souls
to
christ
i
have
known
the
earnest
teaching
of
months
to
be
defeated
by
one
single
volume
of
the
wrong
kind
being
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
scholar
suddenly
marion
sat
upright
slipped
her
pencil
and
into
her
pocket
and
wrote
no
more
a
sentence
in
that
address
had
struck
home
this
determination
to
enter
the
lists
as
a
writer
was
not
all
talk
she
had
long
ago
decided
to
turn
her
talents
in
that
direction
as
the
easiest
thing
in
the
line
of
literature
whither
her
taste
ran
she
had
read
many
of
the
standard
books
read
them
with
amused
eyes
and
curling
lips
and
felt
entirely
conscious
that
she
could
match
them
in
intellectual
power
and
interest
and
do
nothing
remarkable
then
but
there
rang
before
her
this
sentence
every
author
whose
books
go
into
the
is
as
much
a
teacher
in
that
school
as
though
he
had
classes
there
a
teacher
in
the
actually
a
she
had
never
intended
that
she
had
no
desire
to
be
a
hypocrite
she
had
no
desire
to
lead
astray
she
write
a
book
that
young
people
ought
to
bring
from
the
with
them
and
have
it
say
nothing
about
christ
and
heaven
and
the
christian
life
surely
she
could
not
be
a
teacher
without
teaching
of
these
things
she
teach
them
incidentally
was
saying
nothing
about
them
speaking
against
them
walden
more
than
intimated
this
after
all
she
said
speaking
to
ruth
as
the
address
closed
i
think
i
shall
commence
my
book
yet
why
oh
because
i
am
sacred
then
impatiently
after
a
moment
silence
during
which
they
changed
their
seats
i
disgusted
with
chautauqua
it
is
going
to
spoil
me
i
feel
my
ambition
oozing
out
at
the
ends
of
my
toes
instead
of
my
fingers
as
i
had
designed
everybody
is
so
awfully
solemn
and
has
so
much
to
say
about
eternity
it
seems
we
ca
whisper
to
each
other
without
starting
something
that
does
even
end
in
eternity
but
was
he
logical
and
eloquent
i
do
know
ruth
said
absently
and
she
wondered
if
marion
knew
how
true
her
words
were
ruth
had
heard
scarcely
a
word
of
address
since
that
last
whisper
so
you
are
destined
to
immortality
remember
words
spoken
in
jest
and
yet
thrilling
her
through
and
through
with
a
solemn
meaning
she
had
always
known
and
always
believed
this
she
was
no
skeptic
yet
her
heart
had
never
taken
it
in
with
a
great
throb
of
anxiety
as
it
did
at
that
moment
she
being
led
of
the
spirit
of
god
the
two
merely
changed
their
positions
and
looked
about
them
a
little
and
then
prepared
to
give
attention
to
the
next
entertainment
which
was
a
story
from
emily
huntington
miller
marion
was
the
only
one
who
was
in
the
least
familiar
with
her
she
being
the
only
one
who
had
felt
that
absorbing
interest
in
juvenile
literature
that
had
led
her
to
keep
pace
with
the
times
i
disposed
to
listen
to
with
all
due
respect
and
attention
she
said
as
she
rearranged
herself
and
got
out
her
she
is
one
of
the
few
people
who
seem
not
to
have
bidden
a
solemn
farewell
to
their
common
sense
when
they
set
out
to
entertain
the
children
i
have
read
everything
she
ever
wrote
and
liked
it
too
i
set
out
to
make
an
idol
of
her
in
my
more
juvenile
days
i
used
to
think
that
the
height
of
my
ambition
would
be
attained
if
i
could
have
a
long
look
at
her
going
to
try
it
and
see
if
it
satisfies
me
though
we
are
such
aspiring
and
unsatisfied
creatures
that
i
strongly
suspect
i
shall
go
on
reaching
out
for
something
else
even
after
experience
very
little
whispering
was
done
after
that
for
some
time
although
marion
made
light
of
her
youthful
dreams
there
was
a
strong
feeling
of
excitement
and
interest
clustering
around
this
first
sight
of
the
woman
whose
name
she
had
known
so
long
and
something
in
the
fair
sweet
face
and
cultured
voice
fascinated
and
held
her
much
as
she
had
fancied
in
her
earlier
days
would
be
the
case
she
frowned
when
she
heard
the
request
to
reporters
to
lay
aside
their
pencils
she
had
meant
to
earn
laurels
by
reporting
this
delicious
bit
of
imagery
set
in
between
the
graver
sermons
and
lectures
but
after
all
it
was
a
rest
to
give
herself
up
to
the
uninterrupted
enjoyment
of
taking
in
every
word
and
tone
taking
it
in
for
her
own
private
benefit
the
parish
of
fair
haven
how
heartily
she
enjoyed
it
the
refined
and
delicate
and
yet
keen
and
intense
satire
underlying
the
whole
quaint
original
story
was
of
just
the
nature
to
hold
and
captivate
her
she
was
just
in
the
mood
to
enjoy
it
too
for
was
it
not
aimed
at
that
class
of
people
who
awakened
her
own
keenest
sense
of
satire
the
christian
world
she
did
not
belong
to
it
you
know
in
her
own
estimation
was
entirely
without
the
pale
of
its
sarcasm
stranded
on
a
high
and
majestic
rock
of
unbelief
in
everything
and
in
a
condition
to
be
amused
at
the
follies
of
people
who
played
at
belief
and
treated
what
they
was
solemn
realities
as
if
they
were
cradle
stories
or
nicely
woven
fiction
there
was
no
listener
in
all
that
crowd
who
so
enjoyed
the
keen
play
of
wit
and
the
sharp
home
thrusts
as
did
marion
wilbur
ruth
was
a
little
undecided
what
to
think
she
did
not
belong
to
the
class
who
were
hit
to
be
sure
but
her
father
always
gave
largely
to
missions
whenever
the
solicitor
called
on
him
she
had
heard
his
name
mentioned
with
respect
as
one
of
the
most
benevolent
men
of
the
day
she
did
not
quite
like
the
very
low
and
place
which
miller
view
of
the
mission
question
gave
him
according
to
the
people
of
fair
haven
to
give
one
thousands
to
the
cause
was
the
most
commonplace
thing
in
the
world
not
to
do
so
was
to
be
an
inhuman
wretch
ruth
did
quite
like
it
in
truth
she
was
just
enough
within
the
circle
of
modern
christianity
to
feel
herself
slightly
grazed
by
the
satire
it
is
absurd
she
said
to
marion
as
they
went
up
the
hill
what
is
the
sense
in
a
woman
talking
in
that
way
as
if
people
were
they
ever
so
good
and
benevolent
could
get
themselves
up
in
that
ridiculous
manner
if
we
live
in
the
world
at
all
we
have
to
have
a
little
regard
for
propriety
i
wonder
if
she
thinks
one
entire
time
and
money
should
be
devoted
to
the
heathen
marion
answered
her
with
spirit
oh
do
try
to
apologize
for
the
folly
that
is
going
on
in
this
world
in
the
name
of
religion
it
ca
be
done
and
sensible
people
only
make
fools
of
themselves
if
they
attempt
it
there
is
nothing
plainer
or
more
impossible
to
deny
than
that
give
and
work
and
pray
for
the
heathen
as
though
they
were
a
miserable
and
abominable
set
of
brutes
who
ought
to
be
exterminated
from
the
face
of
the
earth
but
for
whom
some
ridiculous
fanatics
called
had
projected
a
wild
scheme
to
do
something
and
forsooth
must
be
kept
from
starving
somehow
even
though
they
had
been
unmitigated
fools
so
the
paltry
collections
are
doled
out
with
sarcastic
undertones
about
the
of
money
and
the
sin
of
missionaries
wearing
clothes
and
expecting
to
have
things
to
eat
after
throwing
themselves
away
talk
to
me
i
been
to
missionary
societies
i
know
all
about
it
the
whole
system
is
one
that
is
exactly
calculated
to
make
infidels
i
believe
satan
got
it
up
because
he
knew
in
just
what
an
abominable
way
the
dear
christians
would
go
at
it
and
what
a
horrid
farce
they
would
make
of
it
all
it
is
a
great
pity
you
are
not
a
christian
marion
i
never
come
in
contact
with
any
one
who
understands
their
duty
so
thoroughly
as
you
appear
to
and
i
think
you
ought
to
be
practicing
ruth
said
this
calmly
enough
she
was
not
particularly
disturbed
she
did
not
belong
to
them
you
know
but
for
all
that
she
was
remotely
connected
with
those
who
did
and
was
just
enough
jarred
to
make
her
give
this
quiet
home
thrust
oddly
enough
it
struck
marion
as
it
never
had
before
although
the
same
idea
had
been
suggested
to
her
by
other
nettled
mortals
it
was
true
that
she
had
realized
how
the
practicing
ought
to
be
done
and
a
vague
wish
that
she
believe
in
it
all
and
could
work
by
their
professed
standard
with
her
flitted
over
her
meantime
flossy
was
being
educated
the
morning
work
had
touched
her
from
a
different
standpoint
she
had
not
heard
walden
instead
she
had
wandered
into
a
bit
of
holy
ground
she
began
by
losing
her
way
it
is
one
of
the
easiest
things
to
do
at
chautauqua
the
avenues
cross
and
recross
in
an
altogether
bewildering
manner
to
one
not
accustomed
to
newly
cities
and
just
when
one
imagines
himself
at
the
goal
for
which
he
started
lo
there
is
woods
and
nothing
else
anywhere
another
attempt
patiently
followed
for
an
hour
has
the
exasperating
effect
of
bringing
him
to
the
very
point
from
which
he
started
such
an
experience
had
flossy
when
by
reason
of
her
loitering
propensities
she
became
detached
from
her
party
and
tried
to
find
her
own
way
to
the
stand
a
whole
hour
of
wandering
then
a
turn
into
perfect
chaos
she
had
no
more
idea
where
she
was
than
if
she
had
been
in
the
of
london
clearly
she
must
inquire
the
way
she
looked
about
her
it
was
queer
to
be
lost
in
the
woods
and
yet
be
surrounded
by
tents
and
people
she
stooped
and
peeped
timidly
into
a
tent
the
corner
of
which
was
raised
to
admit
air
and
from
which
the
sound
of
voices
issued
come
in
said
a
pleasant
voice
and
the
hostess
arose
from
the
foot
of
her
bed
and
came
forward
with
greeting
exactly
as
though
they
had
been
waiting
for
flossy
all
the
morning
would
you
like
to
rest
come
right
in
we
have
plenty
of
room
and
the
most
lovely
accommodations
and
a
silvery
laugh
accompanied
the
words
while
the
little
lady
whisked
a
tin
basin
from
a
low
stool
and
dusting
it
rapidly
with
her
handkerchief
proffered
her
guest
a
seat
with
as
graceful
an
air
as
though
the
stool
had
been
an
upholstered
in
velvet
the
only
other
the
low
bed
was
full
there
being
three
ladies
tucked
about
on
it
in
various
stages
of
restful
work
for
they
had
books
and
papers
strewn
about
and
each
held
a
pencil
poised
as
if
ready
for
action
at
a
moment
i
afraid
i
intrude
flossy
said
sweetly
but
the
truth
is
i
have
lost
my
friends
and
my
way
and
i
really
am
an
object
of
pity
for
i
have
been
wandering
up
hill
and
down
till
my
strength
is
less
than
it
was
poor
child
came
sympathetically
from
the
bed
spoken
by
the
eldest
of
the
ladies
while
another
rapidly
improvised
a
fan
out
of
the
and
passed
it
to
her
meantime
flossy
looked
about
her
in
secret
delight
something
about
the
air
of
the
tent
and
the
surroundings
and
an
indefinite
something
about
every
one
of
the
ladies
told
her
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
that
she
was
among
the
workers
that
she
had
unwittingly
and
gracefully
slipped
behind
the
scenes
and
had
been
cordially
admitted
to
one
of
the
of
chautauqua
and
there
were
many
things
she
wanted
to
know
chapter
xii
flossy
at
school
she
had
the
least
idea
who
they
were
but
like
an
earnest
little
diplomatist
she
set
to
work
to
find
out
i
started
for
the
auditorium
she
said
i
wanted
to
hear
walden
but
he
has
had
time
to
make
a
long
speech
and
get
through
since
i
first
started
i
think
it
must
be
nearly
eleven
no
they
said
laughing
it
is
only
half
past
ten
her
wanderings
had
not
been
so
long
as
they
seemed
but
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
try
to
hear
anything
from
him
now
she
would
not
be
at
all
likely
to
get
a
seat
and
besides
his
time
was
nearly
over
she
would
better
wait
and
go
down
with
them
in
time
for
miller
we
were
obliged
to
miss
walden
the
elder
lady
explained
we
disliked
to
very
much
probably
it
was
as
instructive
as
anything
we
shall
get
but
we
had
work
that
had
to
be
done
so
we
ran
away
do
you
have
to
bring
work
to
chautauqua
with
you
flossy
asked
with
insinuating
sweetness
how
very
busy
you
must
be
i
would
have
tried
to
run
away
from
my
work
for
two
weeks
if
i
had
been
you
the
bright
little
hostess
laughed
chautauqua
work
she
said
and
somebody
has
to
get
ready
for
it
this
lady
beside
me
expects
an
overwhelming
sabbath
class
here
and
much
time
has
to
be
given
to
the
lesson
we
lesser
mortals
are
ostensibly
going
to
help
her
but
in
reality
we
are
going
to
look
and
see
how
she
does
it
have
you
found
out
flossy
asked
in
a
little
tremor
of
delight
this
was
what
she
wanted
to
know
how
to
do
it
all
the
lady
who
had
been
pointed
out
as
teacher
answered
her
quickly
so
far
as
her
words
could
be
said
to
be
an
answer
are
you
a
teacher
no
flossy
said
flushing
and
feeling
like
a
naughty
child
whose
curiosity
had
led
her
into
mischief
no
i
am
not
but
i
want
to
be
i
do
know
how
to
work
at
all
in
any
way
but
i
want
to
learn
are
you
looking
for
work
to
do
for
the
master
the
same
lady
asked
with
a
sweet
cheery
voice
and
smile
not
at
all
as
if
this
were
a
subject
which
she
must
touch
cautiously
yes
flossy
said
her
cheeks
all
in
a
glow
she
did
not
know
how
to
work
she
had
but
just
found
out
that
she
wanted
to
indeed
she
had
but
yesterday
known
anything
of
him
then
this
unusual
company
of
ladies
came
with
one
consent
and
eager
eyes
and
voices
and
took
her
hand
and
said
how
glad
they
were
to
welcome
her
to
the
ranks
they
knew
she
would
love
the
work
and
the
rewards
were
so
sure
and
so
precious
all
this
was
new
and
strange
and
delightful
to
flossy
then
they
began
each
eagerly
to
tell
about
their
work
they
were
all
infant
or
primary
class
teachers
and
all
enthusiasts
who
that
has
to
do
with
the
teaching
of
little
children
and
attains
to
any
measure
of
success
but
is
largely
gifted
with
this
same
element
they
had
been
talking
over
and
preparing
their
lesson
together
and
they
talked
it
over
again
before
the
bewildered
flossy
who
had
no
idea
that
there
was
such
a
wonderful
story
in
all
the
bible
as
they
were
developing
out
of
a
few
bare
details
we
had
just
reached
the
vital
point
of
the
entire
lesson
explained
the
leader
the
place
where
every
true
teacher
needs
most
help
where
having
arranged
all
her
facts
and
got
them
in
martial
order
in
her
brain
she
wants
to
know
the
best
way
of
making
those
facts
of
practical
service
to
the
little
children
who
will
be
before
her
and
at
this
point
i
think
every
teacher
needs
to
go
to
the
fountain
head
for
help
we
were
just
going
to
pray
you
would
like
perhaps
to
join
us
for
just
a
few
moments
if
she
would
intrude
flossy
said
timidly
in
a
tremor
of
satisfaction
and
then
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
bowed
with
a
company
of
her
own
sex
and
heard
the
simple
earnest
voice
of
prayer
the
words
were
startlingly
direct
and
simple
and
flossy
who
had
been
full
of
mysterious
awe
on
this
question
and
who
much
doubted
whether
her
timid
whispers
alone
in
her
tent
could
have
been
called
prayer
was
reassured
and
comforted
if
were
prayer
it
was
simply
talking
in
a
sweet
natural
voice
and
in
the
most
simple
and
natural
language
with
a
dear
and
wise
friend
it
was
the
most
quiet
and
yet
the
most
confident
way
of
asking
for
just
what
one
wanted
and
nothing
more
it
was
what
flossy
needed
she
took
long
strides
in
her
religious
education
there
on
her
knees
and
as
they
went
out
from
that
tent
and
down
the
hill
to
the
meeting
there
was
born
in
her
heart
an
eager
determination
to
enter
the
lists
as
a
teacher
the
very
first
opportunity
and
to
pray
her
lesson
into
her
heart
having
done
what
she
could
to
get
it
into
her
head
if
her
anxious
and
discouraged
pastor
could
have
been
gifted
with
supernatural
and
prophetic
vision
and
could
have
seen
that
resolve
and
looking
ahead
the
fruit
that
was
to
be
borne
from
it
how
would
his
anxious
soul
have
thanked
god
and
taken
courage
in
this
mood
came
flossy
to
listen
to
the
story
of
the
parish
of
fair
haven
as
it
flowed
down
to
her
in
miller
musical
voice
one
who
comes
from
her
knees
to
listen
is
sure
to
find
the
seed
if
it
has
been
put
in
flossy
found
hers
often
in
the
course
of
her
young
life
she
had
been
at
church
and
sat
in
the
attitude
of
listener
while
a
missionary
sermon
was
preached
she
had
heard
perhaps
ten
sentences
from
those
sermons
not
ten
consecutive
sentences
but
words
scattered
here
and
there
through
the
whole
from
these
she
had
gathered
that
there
was
to
be
a
collection
taken
for
the
cause
of
missions
just
where
the
money
was
to
go
and
just
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
when
it
arrived
what
had
been
accomplished
by
missionary
effort
what
the
christian
world
was
hoping
for
in
that
direction
all
these
things
flossy
shipley
knew
no
more
about
than
her
kitten
did
perhaps
it
was
not
strange
then
that
although
abundantly
supplied
with
she
had
never
in
her
life
given
anything
to
the
work
of
missions
not
that
she
would
not
willingly
have
deposited
some
of
her
money
in
the
box
for
whatever
use
the
authorities
chose
to
make
of
it
had
she
happened
to
have
any
but
young
ladies
as
a
rule
have
been
educated
to
imagine
that
there
is
one
day
in
the
week
in
which
their
portmonnaies
can
be
off
duty
there
being
no
shopping
to
be
done
no
worsteds
to
match
no
confectionary
to
tempt
what
earthly
use
for
money
so
it
was
locked
up
at
home
this
at
least
is
the
way
in
which
flossy
shipley
had
argued
without
knowing
that
she
argued
at
all
now
she
was
looking
at
things
with
new
eyes
the
same
things
that
she
had
heard
of
hundreds
of
times
but
how
different
they
were
what
a
remarkable
scheme
it
was
this
carrying
the
story
of
jesus
to
those
miserable
ignorant
ones
getting
them
ready
for
the
heaven
that
had
been
made
ready
for
them
the
people
of
fair
haven
did
not
appear
to
her
like
lunatics
as
they
did
to
ruth
erskine
she
was
not
you
will
remember
of
the
class
who
had
argued
this
question
in
their
ignorance
and
quieted
their
consciences
with
the
foolish
assertion
that
the
church
collections
went
to
pay
secretaries
and
treasurers
and
erect
splendid
public
buildings
she
belonged
rather
to
that
less
hopeless
class
who
had
never
thought
at
all
now
as
she
listened
her
eyes
brightened
with
feeling
and
her
cheeks
glowed
the
whole
sublime
of
missions
was
being
mapped
out
to
her
on
the
face
of
that
quaint
allegory
and
her
heart
responded
warmly
curiously
enough
her
first
throbs
of
conscience
were
not
for
herself
but
for
her
father
the
portly
gentleman
who
occasionally
sat
at
the
head
of
the
shipley
pew
and
who
certainly
never
parted
company
with
his
on
sabbath
or
on
any
other
day
did
give
liberally
to
foreign
missions
she
could
not
determine
as
to
the
probabilities
of
the
case
he
was
counted
a
liberal
man
people
liked
to
come
to
him
to
start
subscriptions
but
flossy
felt
instinctively
that
a
subscription
paper
with
her
father
name
leading
it
was
different
someway
from
a
quiet
box
and
no
noise
nor
words
she
doubted
whether
the
cause
had
been
materially
helped
by
him
she
lost
some
sentences
of
the
story
while
she
planned
ways
for
interesting
her
father
and
securing
liberal
donations
from
him
and
then
she
was
suddenly
startled
back
to
personality
by
hearing
some
astounding
statements
from
the
reader
it
would
be
easy
to
drop
into
a
household
box
the
price
of
an
apple
or
a
paper
or
a
glass
of
peanuts
and
yet
who
does
it
why
there
are
young
ladies
who
will
actually
not
give
two
cents
a
week
from
the
money
that
they
waste
the
rich
blood
mounted
in
waves
to
flossy
forehead
apples
and
papers
were
not
in
her
line
but
was
there
a
certain
stand
which
she
passed
almost
daily
on
her
way
down
town
and
did
she
ever
pass
it
without
indulging
in
a
glass
of
peanuts
neither
was
that
the
end
why
once
started
on
that
list
and
her
wastes
were
almost
numberless
how
fond
she
was
of
cream
dates
and
how
expensive
they
were
and
oranges
the
tempting
yellow
globes
were
always
shining
at
her
from
certain
windows
as
she
passed
oh
they
were
just
endless
her
temptations
and
her
falls
in
that
direction
only
who
had
ever
supposed
that
there
was
any
harm
in
this
lavish
treatment
of
herself
and
of
any
friends
whom
she
happened
to
meet
yet
it
was
true
that
she
had
never
given
any
money
at
all
to
the
work
of
sending
the
bible
to
those
who
are
without
it
they
will
not
give
two
cents
a
week
said
miller
it
was
true
she
had
not
given
two
cents
a
week
or
even
two
cents
a
year
she
had
simply
ignored
the
existence
of
such
a
need
for
money
true
she
had
not
been
a
christian
but
she
was
surprised
to
see
how
little
this
refuge
served
her
i
have
been
a
human
being
she
told
herself
with
a
flush
on
her
face
and
i
ought
to
have
had
sufficient
interest
in
humanity
to
have
wanted
those
poor
creatures
civilized
but
there
was
another
thrust
preparing
for
flossy
the
reader
presently
touched
upon
one
item
of
expenditure
common
to
ladies
namely
kid
gloves
and
made
the
bewildering
statement
that
economy
in
this
matter
to
the
degree
that
needless
purchases
should
be
avoided
would
treble
the
fund
in
the
missionary
treasury
it
could
not
be
that
from
among
that
sea
of
faces
the
speaker
had
singled
out
flossy
shipley
and
yet
that
is
the
way
it
seemed
to
her
if
there
was
any
one
expense
which
stood
out
glaringly
above
another
in
her
list
of
luxuries
it
was
kid
gloves
they
must
be
absolutely
immaculate
as
to
quality
shade
and
fit
and
she
remorselessly
consigned
them
to
the
at
the
first
hint
of
rip
or
change
of
color
how
strange
that
miller
should
have
pitched
upon
just
that
item
and
what
an
amazing
declaration
to
make
concerning
it
it
was
very
strange
had
any
one
been
looking
on
to
observe
it
the
manner
in
which
this
young
girl
was
being
educated
it
is
doubtful
if
a
whole
year
of
church
work
in
the
regular
home
routine
listening
to
the
stated
statistical
sermon
of
her
pastor
that
sermon
which
presupposes
so
much
more
knowledge
than
people
possess
would
have
to
do
for
flossy
what
the
strange
fanciful
pungent
story
of
fair
haven
did
before
that
hour
was
closed
she
had
settled
within
her
resolute
little
heart
a
plan
that
should
henceforth
put
her
in
close
communion
and
sympathy
with
mission
work
not
exactly
the
plans
of
operation
except
that
kid
gloves
and
peanuts
took
stern
places
in
the
background
but
this
was
simply
the
foundation
for
a
resolute
system
of
education
carried
all
through
her
future
life
what
a
pity
it
seems
sometimes
that
people
can
not
read
the
hearts
and
watch
the
springs
of
action
of
those
around
them
if
miller
as
she
closed
her
paper
and
moved
away
from
the
platform
could
have
seen
the
earnest
purpose
glowing
and
throbbing
in
flossy
heart
and
have
known
that
it
was
born
of
words
of
hers
what
a
glad
and
thankful
heart
would
she
have
carried
back
to
her
tent
also
if
the
much
troubled
pastor
at
home
could
have
taken
peeps
into
the
future
and
seen
what
flossy
shipley
resolves
would
do
for
missions
how
glad
he
would
have
been
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
lay
all
the
troubles
and
the
tangles
down
in
the
hand
that
overrules
it
all
and
say
in
peace
and
restfulness
he
knoweth
the
end
from
the
beginning
chapter
xiii
cross
purposes
when
people
start
out
with
the
express
design
of
having
a
good
time
irrespective
of
other
people
plans
or
feelings
in
short
with
a
general
forgetfulness
of
the
existence
of
others
they
are
very
likely
to
find
at
the
close
of
the
day
that
a
failure
has
been
made
it
did
not
take
the
entire
day
to
convince
eurie
mitchell
that
chautauqua
was
not
the
synonym
for
absolute
unalloyed
you
will
remember
that
she
detached
herself
from
her
party
in
the
early
morning
and
set
out
to
find
pleasure
or
as
she
phrased
it
fun
she
imagined
them
to
be
interchangeable
terms
she
had
not
meant
to
be
deserted
but
had
hoped
to
secure
ruth
for
her
companion
she
not
having
the
excuse
of
wishing
to
report
the
meetings
to
call
her
to
them
failing
in
her
in
case
she
should
have
a
fit
of
obstinacy
and
choose
to
attend
the
meetings
eurie
counted
fully
upon
flossy
as
an
ally
much
to
her
surprise
and
no
little
to
her
chagrin
flossy
proved
decidedly
the
more
determined
of
the
two
no
amount
of
coaxing
and
eurie
even
descended
to
the
employment
of
that
weapon
had
the
least
effect
to
be
sure
flossy
presented
no
more
powerful
argument
than
that
it
did
not
look
well
to
come
to
the
meeting
and
then
not
attend
it
but
she
carried
her
point
and
left
the
young
searcher
for
fun
with
a
clear
field
now
fun
rarely
comes
for
the
searching
it
is
more
likely
to
spring
upon
one
unawares
so
though
eurie
walked
up
and
down
and
stared
about
her
and
lost
herself
in
the
labyrinths
of
the
intersecting
paths
and
tore
her
dress
in
a
thicket
and
caught
her
foot
in
a
bog
to
the
great
detriment
of
shoe
and
temper
she
still
found
not
what
she
was
searching
for
several
times
she
came
in
sight
of
the
stand
once
or
twice
in
sound
of
the
speaker
voice
but
having
so
determinately
carried
her
point
in
the
morning
she
did
not
choose
to
abandon
her
position
and
appear
among
the
listeners
though
sorely
tempted
to
do
so
she
wandered
into
several
side
tents
in
hope
of
finding
something
to
distract
her
attention
but
she
only
found
that
which
provoked
her
in
one
of
them
a
young
lady
and
gentleman
were
bending
eagerly
over
a
book
and
talking
earnestly
they
were
interesting
looking
people
and
she
hovered
near
hoping
that
she
had
at
last
found
the
children
who
would
play
with
her
a
remembrance
of
one
of
her
nursery
stories
coming
to
her
just
then
and
a
ludicrous
sense
of
her
resemblance
to
the
truant
boy
who
spent
the
long
bright
day
in
the
woods
searching
for
one
not
too
busy
to
play
but
these
two
were
discussing
nothing
of
more
importance
than
the
lesson
for
the
coming
sabbath
and
though
she
hovered
in
their
vicinity
for
some
time
she
caught
only
stray
words
names
of
places
in
the
far
away
judean
land
that
seemed
to
her
like
a
name
in
the
arabian
nights
or
an
eager
dissertation
on
the
different
views
of
eminent
commentators
on
this
or
that
knotty
point
and
so
engrossed
were
they
in
their
work
that
they
bestowed
on
her
only
the
slightest
passing
glance
and
then
bent
over
their
books
she
went
away
in
disgust
at
the
next
tent
half
a
dozen
ladies
were
sitting
she
halted
there
here
at
last
were
some
people
who
like
herself
were
bored
with
this
everlasting
meeting
and
had
escaped
to
have
a
bit
of
gossip
who
knew
but
she
might
creep
into
the
circle
and
find
pleasant
acquaintances
so
she
drew
nearer
and
listened
a
moment
to
catch
the
subject
under
discussion
she
heard
the
voice
of
prayer
and
a
nearer
peep
showed
her
that
every
head
was
bowed
on
the
seat
in
front
and
one
of
the
ladies
in
a
low
voice
was
asking
for
enlightenment
the
lesson
for
the
coming
what
wonderful
lesson
can
it
be
that
is
so
fearfully
important
she
muttered
as
she
plunged
recklessly
into
the
mud
and
made
her
way
in
all
haste
up
the
hill
without
attempting
any
more
tents
who
ever
heard
such
an
ado
made
about
a
lesson
these
people
all
act
as
though
there
was
nothing
of
any
consequence
anywhere
but
i
guess
it
is
the
first
time
that
such
a
was
ever
gotten
up
over
teaching
a
dozen
verses
to
a
parcel
of
children
i
wonder
if
the
people
at
home
ever
make
such
a
uproar
about
the
lesson
i
know
some
teachers
who
own
up
on
the
way
to
church
that
they
know
where
the
lesson
is
this
must
be
a
peculiar
one
i
wonder
how
i
shall
contrive
to
discover
where
it
is
the
girls
wo
know
of
course
with
all
their
boasted
going
to
meeting
they
know
no
more
about
lessons
than
i
do
myself
i
would
really
like
to
find
out
i
mean
to
ask
the
next
person
i
meet
it
will
be
in
accordance
with
the
fashion
of
the
place
think
of
my
walking
down
broadway
of
a
sunny
morning
and
stopping
a
stranger
with
the
query
you
tell
me
where
the
lesson
is
please
and
at
this
point
eurie
burst
into
a
laugh
over
the
absurdity
of
the
picture
she
had
conjured
but
this
is
not
broadway
she
said
a
moment
afterward
and
i
mean
to
try
it
here
comes
a
man
who
looks
as
if
he
ought
to
know
everything
i
wonder
who
he
is
i
seen
his
face
a
dozen
times
since
i
have
been
here
he
led
the
singing
yesterday
perhaps
he
knows
nothing
but
sing
they
are
not
apt
to
but
his
face
looks
as
though
he
might
have
a
few
other
ideas
anyway
i
try
him
and
if
he
knows
nothing
about
it
he
will
go
away
with
a
confused
impression
that
i
am
a
very
virtuous
young
lady
and
that
he
ought
to
have
known
all
about
it
and
who
knows
what
good
seed
may
be
sown
by
my
own
wicked
hand
whereupon
she
halted
before
the
gentleman
who
was
going
with
rapid
strides
down
the
hill
and
said
in
her
clearest
and
most
respectful
tone
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
where
the
lesson
for
next
sabbath
commences
i
have
forgotten
just
where
it
is
there
was
no
hesitation
no
query
in
his
face
as
to
what
she
was
talking
about
or
uncertainty
as
to
the
answer
it
is
the
fifth
chapter
from
the
fifth
to
the
fifteenth
verse
he
said
glibly
all
fives
you
see
easy
to
remember
it
is
a
grand
lesson
hard
to
teach
though
because
it
is
all
there
are
you
a
teacher
for
next
sunday
you
must
come
to
the
teachers
meeting
morning
you
will
get
good
help
there
glorious
meeting
is
it
i
so
glad
you
are
enjoying
it
and
away
he
went
every
trace
of
had
vanished
from
eurie
face
instead
it
was
twinkling
with
laughter
the
fifth
chapter
and
fifteenth
verse
of
what
certainly
she
had
no
more
idea
than
the
birds
had
who
twittered
above
her
head
how
entirely
certain
he
had
been
that
of
course
she
knew
the
general
locality
of
the
lesson
a
teacher
and
coming
to
the
teachers
meeting
for
enlightenment
as
to
how
to
teach
the
lesson
i
wonder
who
he
is
she
said
again
as
these
thoughts
flashed
through
her
brain
and
following
out
the
next
impulse
that
came
to
her
she
stopped
an
old
gentleman
who
was
walking
leisurely
down
and
said
as
she
pointed
out
her
late
informant
what
is
that
man
name
please
i
ca
recall
it
that
said
the
old
gentleman
is
sherwin
of
newark
have
you
heard
him
sing
yes
well
that
is
worth
hearing
and
have
you
heard
him
talk
no
well
he
can
talk
you
will
hear
him
and
enjoy
it
too
see
if
you
do
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
young
lady
to
know
him
thoroughly
you
ought
to
hear
him
pray
there
is
the
real
power
in
a
man
let
me
know
how
a
man
can
pray
and
i
risk
his
talking
eurie
had
got
much
more
information
now
than
she
had
asked
for
she
ventured
on
no
more
questions
but
made
all
haste
to
her
tent
where
seated
upon
a
corner
of
the
bed
one
foot
tucked
under
her
while
the
unfortunate
shoe
tried
to
dry
she
sewed
industriously
on
the
tear
in
her
dress
and
tried
to
imagine
what
she
could
do
next
certainly
they
had
long
days
at
chautauqua
i
shall
go
to
meeting
this
afternoon
she
said
resolutely
if
they
have
three
sermons
each
an
hour
long
and
what
is
more
i
shall
find
out
where
that
lesson
is
the
next
thing
she
did
was
to
write
a
letter
to
her
brother
nellis
a
dashing
boy
two
years
her
senior
and
her
favorite
companion
in
her
search
for
pleasure
here
is
a
copy
of
the
letter
dear
nel
i
wish
you
were
here
chautauqua
is
so
funny
as
it
might
be
there
are
some
things
that
are
done
here
continually
in
the
first
place
it
rains
why
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
it
just
ca
help
it
the
sun
puts
on
a
bland
face
and
looks
glowing
intentions
and
while
you
are
congratulating
your
next
neighbor
on
the
prospect
she
is
engaged
in
clutching
frantically
after
her
umbrella
to
save
her
hat
from
the
first
drops
of
the
new
shower
next
they
have
meetings
and
there
is
literally
no
postponement
on
account
of
the
weather
it
is
really
funny
to
see
the
way
in
which
the
people
rush
when
the
bell
rings
rain
or
shine
nel
only
think
of
flossy
shipley
going
in
the
rain
to
hear
a
man
preach
of
the
of
the
press
or
something
of
that
sort
it
was
good
though
worth
hearing
i
went
myself
because
of
course
one
must
do
something
and
the
frantic
fashion
of
the
place
is
to
go
to
meeting
at
the
same
time
i
do
understand
flossy
she
is
different
from
what
she
ever
was
at
home
i
suppose
it
is
the
force
of
the
many
shining
examples
all
around
her
you
know
she
always
was
a
good
little
sheep
about
following
somebody
lead
marion
is
reporting
and
has
to
be
industrious
she
is
queer
nel
she
professes
infidelity
you
know
and
you
have
no
idea
how
mad
she
gets
over
anything
that
seems
to
be
casting
reproach
on
christianity
unless
indeed
she
says
it
herself
which
is
often
enough
but
then
she
seems
to
think
it
is
all
right
ruth
keeps
on
the
even
tenor
of
her
way
it
would
take
an
earthquake
to
move
that
girl
i
have
had
the
greatest
fun
this
morning
i
have
been
mistaken
for
a
teacher
who
had
the
misfortune
to
forget
at
what
verse
her
lesson
commenced
you
see
i
was
cultivating
new
acquaintances
and
a
sherwin
gave
me
good
advice
that
and
some
other
things
aroused
my
curiosity
concerning
that
same
lesson
and
i
am
going
to
find
out
where
it
is
did
you
know
that
lessons
were
such
remarkable
affairs
the
one
for
next
sunday
must
comprise
the
most
wonderful
portion
of
scripture
that
there
is
for
hundreds
of
people
on
these
grounds
are
talking
about
it
and
i
stumbled
upon
a
party
of
ladies
this
morning
who
were
actually
praying
over
it
another
thing
i
overheard
this
morning
which
is
news
to
me
that
all
the
world
was
at
work
on
the
same
lesson
that
is
rather
fascinating
is
it
to
think
of
so
many
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
all
pitching
into
the
same
verses
on
sunday
morning
it
is
quite
sentimental
too
or
capable
of
being
made
so
for
instance
by
a
great
stretch
of
your
imagination
suppose
you
and
me
to
be
very
dear
friends
separated
by
miles
of
ocean
we
will
say
and
both
devoted
teachers
is
that
a
stretch
now
such
being
the
astonishing
case
would
it
be
pleasant
to
be
at
work
on
the
same
lesson
do
you
see
lets
play
do
it
you
look
up
the
lesson
for
next
sabbath
and
so
will
i
wo
that
have
all
the
charm
of
novelty
then
give
me
the
benefit
of
your
ideas
acquired
on
that
important
subject
and
i
do
the
same
to
you
really
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
the
plan
delights
me
i
wonder
how
you
will
carry
it
out
shall
you
go
to
what
will
the
dear
doctor
say
if
he
sees
you
walk
into
his
i
really
wish
i
were
there
to
enjoy
the
sensation
meantime
i
going
to
look
up
an
altogether
wonderful
teacher
for
myself
and
then
for
comparing
notes
my
spirits
begin
to
rise
they
have
been
rather
damp
all
the
morning
but
i
see
fun
in
the
distance
we
are
to
have
a
sensation
this
afternoon
in
the
shape
of
a
troupe
of
singers
called
the
tennesseeans
negroes
you
know
and
they
are
to
give
songs
and
the
like
i
expect
to
enjoy
it
thoroughly
but
you
ought
to
see
ruth
curl
her
aristocratic
nose
at
the
thought
a
vulgar
idea
and
altogether
inappropriate
to
the
occasion
she
likes
to
see
things
in
keeping
if
it
is
a
religious
gathering
let
them
keep
it
such
and
not
introduce
negro
minstrels
for
the
sake
of
calling
a
low
crowd
together
and
making
a
little
more
money
marion
too
shoots
arrows
from
her
sharp
tongue
at
it
but
she
rather
enjoys
the
idea
just
as
she
does
every
other
thing
that
she
chooses
to
call
inconsistent
when
she
happens
to
be
the
one
to
discover
it
but
woe
to
the
one
who
comments
on
it
further
than
she
chooses
to
go
flossy
and
i
now
look
with
utmost
toleration
on
the
dark
element
that
is
to
be
introduced
i
tell
ruth
that
i
am
really
grateful
to
the
authorities
for
introducing
something
that
a
person
of
my
limited
capacities
can
appreciate
and
flossy
with
her
sweet
little
charitable
voice
has
doubt
they
will
choose
proper
things
to
sing
that
little
mouse
is
really
more
agreeable
than
she
ever
was
in
her
life
and
i
am
amazed
at
it
too
i
expected
the
dear
baby
would
make
us
all
uncomfortable
with
her
finified
whims
but
do
you
think
it
is
our
lofty
ruth
who
is
decidedly
the
most
disagreeable
of
our
party
save
and
except
myself
this
interesting
epistle
was
brought
to
a
sudden
close
by
an
interruption
a
gentleman
came
with
rapid
steps
and
halted
before
her
tent
door
which
was
tied
hospitably
back
i
beg
pardon
he
said
speaking
rapidly
but
this
is
miss
rider
it
is
not
eurie
answered
with
promptness
at
which
information
he
looked
surprised
and
bewildered
is
this
her
tent
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
i
have
been
sent
in
haste
for
her
she
is
wanted
for
a
consultation
and
i
was
told
i
would
find
her
here
perhaps
i
might
leave
a
message
with
you
for
her
it
certainly
is
her
tent
eurie
said
trying
to
keep
down
the
desire
to
laugh
and
i
have
the
least
idea
where
she
is
i
should
be
glad
to
give
her
your
message
if
i
could
but
i
never
saw
the
lady
in
my
life
and
have
no
reason
to
expect
that
pleasure
whereupon
her
questioner
laughed
outright
that
is
a
dilemma
he
said
i
appreciate
your
feelings
for
i
am
precisely
in
the
same
position
but
the
lady
was
described
minutely
to
me
and
i
certainly
thought
i
had
found
her
i
am
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you
and
he
bowed
himself
away
a
new
curiosity
seized
upon
eurie
the
desire
to
see
miss
rider
she
must
be
one
of
them
she
soliloquized
falling
into
flossy
way
of
speaking
of
the
workers
at
chautauqua
he
said
she
was
wanted
for
a
consultation
i
wonder
if
she
can
be
one
of
those
who
are
to
take
part
in
the
primary
exercises
she
must
be
young
for
such
prominent
work
if
she
looks
like
me
but
how
could
he
know
that
since
he
never
saw
her
it
is
very
evident
that
i
am
to
go
to
next
sabbath
anyhow
if
i
never
did
before
for
now
i
have
two
items
of
interest
to
look
up
a
lesson
that
is
in
the
chapter
from
the
fifth
to
the
fifteenth
verse
of
and
a
being
called
rider
so
thinking
she
hastily
concluded
and
folded
her
letter
ready
for
the
afternoon
mail
without
a
thought
or
care
as
to
the
seed
that
she
had
been
sending
away
in
it
or
as
to
the
fruit
it
might
bear
without
the
slightest
insight
into
the
way
she
was
being
led
through
seeming
mistakes
and
accidents
up
to
a
point
that
was
to
influence
all
her
future
chapter
xiv
the
new
lesson
eurie
turned
her
pillow
thumped
the
scant
feathers
into
little
heaps
and
gave
a
dismal
groan
as
she
laid
her
head
back
on
it
it
is
very
queer
she
said
that
as
soon
as
ever
i
make
up
my
mind
to
be
orthodox
and
go
to
meeting
every
time
the
bell
rings
i
should
be
dumped
into
a
heap
on
this
hard
bed
with
the
headache
i
have
had
a
touch
of
it
before
way
of
transgressors
is
hard
quoted
marion
going
on
calmly
with
her
writing
if
you
had
taken
that
horrid
tramp
yesterday
instead
of
going
to
meeting
like
a
christian
you
would
have
been
all
right
i
believe
you
sit
up
nights
to
read
your
bible
so
as
to
have
verses
to
fling
at
people
who
are
overtaken
in
any
possible
trial
or
inconvenience
you
always
have
them
ready
did
you
bring
it
with
you
and
do
you
prepare
a
list
for
each
day
use
this
was
eurie
half
merry
half
petulant
reply
to
the
bible
verse
that
had
been
flung
at
her
marion
carefully
erased
a
word
that
seemed
to
her
fastidious
taste
too
inexpressive
before
she
answered
i
do
own
such
an
article
as
a
bible
my
child
so
your
suspicions
are
entirely
unfounded
my
early
education
was
not
defective
in
that
respect
however
and
i
confess
that
i
find
many
verses
that
seem
to
very
aptly
describe
the
ways
of
sinful
mortals
like
yourself
eurie
raised
herself
on
one
elbow
regardless
of
headache
and
the
cloth
wet
in
vinegar
that
straightway
fell
off
you
do
own
a
bible
she
said
in
utter
surprise
and
with
a
touch
of
actual
dismay
in
her
voice
i
am
depraved
to
that
degree
my
dear
little
saint
i
conclude
that
you
are
more
devoutly
inclined
and
have
one
of
your
own
pray
how
many
chapters
a
day
do
you
read
in
it
eurie
lay
down
again
and
flossy
came
with
the
vinegar
cloth
and
bound
it
securely
on
her
forehead
i
do
read
in
it
very
often
to
be
sure
eurie
murmured
in
fact
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
say
that
i
never
do
but
then
i
own
one
and
always
have
i
am
not
a
heathen
and
really
and
truly
it
seems
almost
queer
not
to
have
a
bible
of
one
own
it
is
a
sort
of
mark
of
civilization
you
know
marion
laughed
i
never
make
a
great
deal
of
pretense
in
that
line
she
said
gayly
as
for
being
a
heathen
that
is
only
a
relative
term
according
to
calkins
they
were
more
or
less
in
advance
of
us
i
am
one
of
the
sort
ruth
your
toilet
ought
to
be
nearly
completed
i
hear
that
indefatigable
bell
you
are
very
foolish
not
to
go
this
morning
and
let
your
writing
wait
we
shall
be
certain
to
have
something
worth
listening
to
it
is
a
strange
time
to
select
for
absence
this
was
ruth
quiet
answer
as
she
pinned
her
lace
ruffle
with
a
gleaming
little
diamond
in
business
there
is
another
verse
for
you
my
heathen
marion
said
with
a
merry
glance
toward
eurie
when
you
get
home
and
get
the
dust
of
years
swept
off
from
your
bible
you
take
a
look
at
it
and
see
if
i
have
not
quoted
correctly
and
a
good
sensible
verse
it
is
i
have
found
it
the
only
way
in
which
to
keep
my
head
above
water
ruthie
the
trouble
is
not
with
me
it
lies
with
those
selfish
and
obstinate
newspaper
men
if
they
would
have
the
sense
to
let
their
papers
wait
over
another
day
i
could
go
to
the
lecture
this
morning
as
it
is
i
am
a
victim
to
their
indifference
if
i
miss
a
blessing
the
sin
will
be
at
door
not
mine
eurie
opened
her
heavy
eyes
and
looked
at
flossy
come
she
said
do
stand
there
mopping
me
in
vinegar
any
longer
are
you
ready
i
am
really
disappointed
i
always
wanted
to
hear
that
man
i
want
to
tell
nel
about
him
flossy
washed
her
hands
shook
back
the
yellow
curls
with
an
indifferent
and
preoccupied
air
and
went
to
the
door
to
wait
for
ruth
she
had
taken
no
part
in
the
war
of
words
that
had
been
passing
between
marion
and
eurie
but
she
had
heard
and
like
almost
everything
else
that
she
heard
during
these
days
it
had
awakened
a
new
thought
and
desire
flossy
was
growing
amazed
at
herself
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
have
spent
her
seventeen
years
of
life
taking
long
naps
and
this
chautauqua
was
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
ocean
that
was
going
to
shake
her
awake
the
special
thought
that
had
dashed
itself
at
her
this
morning
was
that
she
too
had
no
bible
not
that
she
did
not
own
one
elegantly
done
in
velvet
and
clasped
in
gold
so
effectually
clasped
that
it
had
been
sealed
to
her
all
her
life
she
positively
had
no
recollection
of
having
ever
sat
down
deliberately
to
read
the
bible
she
had
looked
over
occasionally
in
school
but
even
this
service
of
her
eyes
had
been
fitful
and
indifferent
and
as
for
her
head
paying
any
sort
of
attention
to
the
reading
it
might
as
well
have
been
done
in
greek
instead
of
french
which
language
she
but
dimly
comprehended
even
when
she
tried
but
now
she
ought
to
have
a
bible
she
ought
not
to
wait
for
that
velvet
covered
one
a
whole
week
in
which
to
find
what
some
of
her
orders
were
and
no
way
in
which
to
find
them
of
course
she
could
buy
one
but
how
queer
it
would
seem
to
be
going
to
the
museum
to
make
a
purchase
of
a
bible
they
will
wonder
why
i
did
not
bring
my
own
she
murmured
with
that
deference
that
she
had
educated
herself
to
pay
to
the
they
who
composed
her
world
and
in
another
instance
the
feeling
of
respect
and
independence
asserted
itself
i
ca
help
that
she
said
positively
shaking
her
curls
with
a
determined
air
and
it
really
makes
no
difference
what
anybody
thinks
of
course
i
must
have
a
bible
and
i
only
wish
i
had
it
for
this
morning
i
shall
certainly
get
one
the
first
opportunity
then
she
turned
and
said
to
the
pretty
little
lady
who
occupied
the
tent
next
door
and
between
whom
and
herself
a
pleasant
acquaintance
was
springing
up
are
you
going
to
the
lecture
flossy
asked
and
the
small
lady
shook
her
head
with
a
wistful
air
dear
me
no
my
young
tyrant
would
consent
to
that
i
meant
to
take
him
down
with
me
and
try
him
but
he
has
gone
to
sleep
and
it
is
just
as
well
for
he
would
have
been
certain
to
want
to
do
all
the
talking
he
has
no
idea
that
there
is
any
one
in
the
country
who
knows
quite
as
much
as
he
does
it
was
said
in
a
half
complaining
tone
but
underneath
it
was
the
foundation
of
tender
pride
that
showed
her
to
be
the
vain
mother
of
the
handsome
tyrant
still
it
seemed
to
be
flossy
duty
to
condole
with
her
you
miss
most
of
the
meetings
do
you
not
of
them
you
see
it
is
inconvenient
to
have
a
husband
who
is
reporter
for
the
press
and
who
must
be
there
to
hear
it
is
only
when
he
must
write
up
his
notes
for
publication
that
i
can
get
a
chance
and
even
then
unless
it
is
baby
sleepy
time
it
does
me
no
good
i
am
especially
sorry
this
morning
for
cuyler
used
to
be
my
pastor
he
married
me
one
summer
morning
just
like
this
and
i
have
laid
eyes
on
him
since
i
should
like
to
hear
his
voice
again
but
it
ca
be
done
now
who
would
have
imagined
that
with
all
the
powers
that
were
bestirring
themselves
to
come
to
flossy
education
it
would
have
been
a
rosy
crowing
baby
in
the
unconsciousness
of
a
morning
nap
that
should
have
given
her
her
first
lesson
in
unselfishness
yet
he
was
the
very
one
it
flashed
over
flossy
in
an
instant
from
some
source
who
was
so
likely
to
have
suggested
it
as
the
sweet
angel
who
hovered
over
the
sleeping
darling
oh
adams
let
me
stay
with
baby
and
you
go
to
hear
cuyler
it
is
a
real
pity
that
you
should
miss
him
when
he
is
associated
with
your
life
in
this
way
i
never
saw
him
and
though
of
course
i
should
like
to
yet
i
presume
there
will
be
opportunities
enough
i
will
be
as
careful
of
baby
as
if
he
were
my
grandson
and
if
he
wakens
i
will
charm
him
out
of
his
wits
so
that
it
will
never
occur
to
him
to
cry
of
course
there
was
demurring
and
profuse
expressions
of
thanks
and
declinatures
all
in
a
breath
but
flossy
was
so
winning
so
eager
so
thoroughly
in
earnest
and
the
little
adams
did
so
love
her
old
pastor
and
did
feel
so
anxious
to
see
him
again
that
in
a
very
short
time
she
was
beguiled
into
going
in
all
haste
to
her
tent
to
make
a
toilet
and
a
blessed
thing
it
was
that
that
sentence
does
not
mean
at
chautauqua
what
it
does
in
buffalo
or
albany
or
a
few
other
places
else
cuyler
might
have
slipped
from
them
before
the
necessary
articles
were
all
in
array
it
involved
simply
the
twitching
off
of
a
white
apron
the
settling
of
a
pretty
sun
hat
for
the
sun
actually
shone
and
the
seizure
of
a
waterproof
needed
if
she
found
a
seat
to
protect
her
from
the
damp
boards
needed
in
any
case
because
in
five
minutes
it
might
rain
and
she
was
ready
ruth
came
to
the
door
come
flossy
she
said
where
in
the
world
are
you
we
shall
be
late
and
said
it
precisely
as
though
she
had
been
waiting
for
that
young
person
for
half
an
hour
flossy
emerged
from
the
adjoining
tent
i
am
not
going
she
said
i
have
turned
and
have
the
sweetest
little
baby
in
here
that
ever
grew
adams
is
going
in
my
place
adams
miss
erskine
and
as
those
two
ladies
walked
away
together
adams
might
have
been
heard
to
say
what
a
lovely
unselfish
disposition
your
friend
has
it
was
so
beautiful
in
her
to
take
me
so
by
storm
this
morning
i
am
afraid
i
was
very
selfish
which
is
apt
to
be
the
case
i
think
when
one
comes
in
contact
with
actual
unselfishness
it
is
one
of
the
christian
graces
that
is
very
hard
to
cultivate
anyway
do
you
think
so
ruth
was
silent
not
from
discourtesy
but
from
astonishment
it
was
such
a
strange
experience
to
hear
any
one
speak
of
flossy
shipley
as
unselfish
in
truth
she
had
grown
up
under
influences
that
had
combined
to
foster
the
most
complete
and
tyrannical
selfishness
exercised
in
a
pretty
winning
sort
of
way
but
rooted
and
grounded
in
her
very
life
so
indeed
was
ruth
but
of
course
did
not
know
that
though
she
had
clear
vision
for
the
mote
in
flossy
eyes
meantime
marion
had
staid
her
busy
pen
and
was
biting
the
end
of
it
thoughtfully
the
two
tents
were
such
near
neighbors
that
the
latter
conversation
and
introduction
had
been
distinctly
heard
she
glanced
around
to
the
girl
on
the
bed
eurie
she
said
are
you
asleep
or
are
you
enjoying
flossy
last
new
departure
eurie
giggled
i
heard
she
said
the
lazy
little
mouse
has
slipped
out
of
a
tedious
hour
and
has
a
chance
to
lounge
and
read
a
pleasant
novel
i
dare
say
the
mother
is
provided
with
them
then
marion
after
another
thoughtful
pause
but
my
child
how
do
you
account
for
the
necessity
of
going
to
the
neighbors
and
taking
the
supervision
of
a
baby
in
order
to
do
that
flossy
need
not
have
gone
to
church
if
she
did
choose
yes
she
need
do
you
suppose
the
child
can
see
that
it
is
the
fashion
of
the
place
she
is
afraid
that
it
would
look
well
to
stay
in
the
tent
and
lounge
without
an
excuse
for
doing
so
if
that
girl
could
only
go
to
a
place
where
it
was
the
fashion
for
all
the
people
to
be
good
she
would
be
a
saint
just
because
were
she
would
have
to
go
to
heaven
muttered
marion
going
on
with
her
writing
and
according
to
you
there
is
no
such
place
so
there
is
no
hope
for
her
after
all
oh
dear
i
wonder
if
you
are
right
and
nothing
is
of
any
consequence
anyhow
and
the
weary
girl
turned
on
her
pillow
and
tried
not
to
think
an
effort
that
was
hard
to
accomplish
after
a
experience
at
chautauqua
flossy
sat
herself
down
beside
the
sleeping
darling
and
cast
about
her
for
something
to
amuse
or
interest
her
eyes
brightening
into
beauty
as
she
recognized
a
worn
and
torn
copy
of
the
bible
eurie
would
have
been
surprised
to
see
the
eagerness
with
which
she
seized
upon
the
book
that
was
to
afford
her
entertainment
she
turned
the
leaves
tenderly
with
a
new
sense
of
possession
about
her
this
bible
was
a
copy
of
letters
that
had
been
written
to
her
words
spoken
many
of
them
by
jesus
himself
strange
that
she
had
so
little
idea
what
they
were
marion
with
her
boasted
infidel
notions
knew
much
more
about
the
book
than
flossy
with
her
nominal
christian
education
and
belief
she
had
no
idea
where
to
turn
or
what
to
look
for
to
help
her
yet
she
turned
the
leaves
slowly
with
a
delicious
sense
of
having
found
a
prize
a
book
of
instructions
a
guide
book
for
her
on
this
journey
that
she
was
just
beginning
to
realize
that
she
was
taking
somewhere
within
it
she
would
find
light
and
help
the
book
was
one
that
had
been
much
used
and
had
a
fashion
of
opening
of
itself
at
certain
places
that
might
have
been
favorites
with
the
little
mother
at
one
of
those
places
flossy
halted
and
read
this
there
was
a
feast
of
the
jews
after
what
i
wonder
she
said
within
herself
she
knew
nothing
about
it
never
mind
i
will
see
pretty
soon
this
is
about
a
feast
where
jesus
was
and
jesus
went
up
to
jerusalem
oh
how
nice
to
have
been
there
wherever
that
was
the
ignorant
little
thing
had
not
the
least
idea
where
jerusalem
was
except
that
it
was
in
that
far
away
misty
holy
land
that
had
seemed
as
vague
and
indefinite
to
her
as
the
grave
or
as
heaven
but
there
came
suddenly
to
her
heart
a
certain
blessed
analogy
if
i
were
going
to
write
an
account
of
my
recent
experiences
to
some
dear
friend
that
i
wanted
to
tell
it
to
she
said
talking
still
to
herself
or
to
the
sleeping
baby
i
would
write
it
something
like
this
this
that
would
mean
let
me
see
what
it
mean
why
after
that
party
at
home
when
i
danced
all
night
and
was
sick
this
there
was
a
feast
of
the
christian
people
at
chautauqua
and
jesus
went
there
i
could
certainly
write
that
for
i
have
seen
him
and
heard
him
speak
in
my
very
heart
then
she
went
on
through
the
second
verse
to
the
third
these
lay
a
great
multitude
of
impotent
folk
of
blind
halt
withered
waiting
for
the
moving
of
the
water
and
here
a
great
swell
of
tears
literally
blinded
her
eyes
it
came
to
her
so
suddenly
so
forcibly
the
great
multitude
here
at
chautauqua
blind
yes
some
of
them
was
not
she
how
many
more
might
there
be
many
of
whom
she
knew
others
that
she
did
not
know
but
that
jesus
did
waiting
without
knowing
that
they
were
waiting
with
tears
and
smiles
and
with
a
new
great
happiness
throbbing
at
her
heart
she
read
through
the
sweet
simple
wonderful
story
how
the
poor
man
met
jesus
how
he
questioned
how
the
man
complained
and
how
jesus
was
greater
than
his
infirmity
through
the
whole
of
it
until
suddenly
she
closed
the
book
her
tears
dried
and
a
solemn
wondering
almost
look
on
her
face
she
had
got
her
lesson
her
directions
her
example
she
could
bear
no
more
even
of
the
bible
just
then
she
said
it
over
that
startling
verse
that
came
to
her
with
a
whole
volume
of
suggestion
the
man
departed
and
told
the
jews
that
it
was
jesus
which
had
made
him
chapter
xv
great
men
ruth
erskine
with
her
skirts
gathered
daintily
around
her
to
avoid
contact
with
the
unclean
earth
made
her
way
skill
fully
through
the
crowd
and
with
the
aid
of
a
determined
spirit
and
a
secured
a
place
and
a
seat
very
near
the
stand
the
little
lady
who
timidly
followed
in
her
lead
was
not
quite
so
fortunate
inasmuch
as
she
had
no
and
was
less
resolved
in
her
determination
to
get
ahead
of
those
who
had
arrived
earlier
so
she
contented
herself
with
a
damp
seat
on
the
end
of
a
board
which
was
vacated
for
her
use
by
a
courteous
gentleman
ruth
you
must
understand
was
not
selfish
in
this
matter
because
she
had
planned
to
be
but
simply
because
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
to
be
otherwise
which
is
one
of
the
misfortunes
that
come
to
people
who
are
educated
in
a
selfish
atmosphere
ruth
erskine
had
come
to
this
meeting
fully
prepared
to
enjoy
it
cuyler
was
a
star
of
sufficient
magnitude
to
attract
her
during
her
frequent
visits
to
new
york
she
had
heard
much
of
but
had
never
seen
him
the
people
whom
she
visited
were
too
elegant
in
their
views
and
practices
to
have
much
in
common
with
the
church
which
was
so
pronounced
on
the
two
great
questions
of
religion
and
temperance
yet
even
with
them
cuyler
and
cuyler
great
church
were
eccentricities
to
be
tolerated
not
ignored
therefore
ruth
had
had
it
in
her
heart
to
enjoy
listening
to
him
sometime
the
sometime
had
arrived
she
had
dressed
herself
with
unusual
care
a
ceremony
which
seemed
to
be
quite
in
the
background
among
the
people
who
were
at
home
at
chautauqua
but
someway
it
seemed
to
ruth
that
the
great
brooklyn
pastor
should
receive
this
mark
of
respect
at
her
hands
so
she
had
spent
the
morning
at
her
toilet
and
was
now
a
fashionable
lady
fashionably
attired
for
church
if
the
people
who
vouchsafed
her
a
glance
as
she
crowded
past
indulged
some
of
them
in
a
smile
at
her
expense
and
thought
the
simple
temple
made
of
trees
and
grasses
an
inappropriate
surrounding
to
her
silken
robes
and
costly
lace
mantle
she
was
none
the
wiser
for
that
you
know
and
took
her
seat
indifferent
to
them
all
except
that
presently
there
stole
over
her
the
sense
of
disagreeable
incongruity
with
her
outdoor
surroundings
so
satan
had
the
pleasure
of
ruffling
her
spirits
and
occupying
her
thoughts
with
her
rich
brown
silk
dress
instead
of
letting
her
heart
be
touched
with
the
solemnity
and
beauty
of
the
grand
hymn
which
rolled
down
those
long
aisles
satan
has
that
everlasting
weapon
what
to
wear
and
what
not
to
wear
everlastingly
at
command
and
wonderfully
under
his
control
but
ruth
in
her
way
was
and
could
control
her
thoughts
when
she
chose
so
she
presently
shook
off
the
feeling
of
annoyance
and
decided
to
give
herself
up
to
the
influences
of
the
hour
by
this
time
cuyler
appeared
and
was
introduced
ruth
gave
him
the
benefit
of
a
very
searching
gaze
and
decided
that
he
was
the
very
last
man
of
all
those
on
the
platform
whom
she
would
have
selected
as
the
speaker
probably
if
cuyler
had
known
this
and
known
also
that
his
personal
presence
entirely
disappointed
her
he
would
not
have
been
greatly
disconcerted
thereby
but
his
subject
was
one
that
found
an
answering
thrill
in
this
young
lady
heart
some
talks
i
have
had
with
great
men
ruth
liked
greatness
in
her
calm
composed
way
she
bowed
before
it
she
would
have
enjoyed
being
great
celebrity
in
a
majestic
dignified
form
would
have
been
her
delight
she
by
no
means
admitted
this
as
eurie
mitchell
so
often
did
she
by
no
means
sought
after
it
in
the
small
ways
within
her
reach
small
ways
did
not
suit
her
they
disgusted
her
but
if
she
could
have
flashed
into
splendid
greatness
if
by
any
amount
of
laborious
study
or
work
or
suffering
she
could
have
seen
the
way
to
renown
she
would
have
grasped
for
it
in
an
instant
the
next
best
thing
to
being
renowned
one
self
was
to
have
renowned
people
for
friends
this
was
another
thing
that
ruth
coveted
in
silence
she
wanted
no
one
to
know
how
earnestly
she
aspired
to
sometime
making
the
acquaintance
of
some
of
the
great
people
not
the
vulgarly
great
those
who
were
in
a
sense
and
in
the
eyes
of
a
few
great
because
of
the
accidents
of
fortune
and
travel
she
knew
such
by
the
scores
indeed
she
had
been
in
circles
many
a
time
where
shone
with
that
sort
of
greatness
herself
perhaps
it
was
for
that
reason
that
it
was
such
a
despised
height
to
her
but
she
meant
the
great
people
of
this
world
people
of
power
people
who
moved
the
masses
by
the
force
of
their
brains
not
one
such
had
she
ever
met
to
look
upon
as
an
acquaintance
and
here
was
this
man
telling
off
the
honored
names
by
the
score
and
saying
my
friend
guthrie
my
good
friend
thomas
carlyle
my
dear
brother
newman
hall
how
would
it
seem
to
stand
in
intimate
relationship
with
one
single
gifted
mind
like
these
and
was
she
destined
ever
to
know
by
actual
experience
there
was
another
reason
why
ruth
had
desired
to
choose
cuyler
to
listen
to
rather
than
some
other
names
on
the
programme
because
from
the
nature
of
his
subject
she
had
judged
it
most
unlikely
that
he
should
have
about
him
any
arrows
that
would
touch
home
to
her
not
that
she
put
it
in
that
language
she
did
not
admit
even
to
herself
that
any
of
the
solemn
words
that
had
been
spoken
at
chautauqua
had
reference
to
her
and
yet
in
a
vague
fitful
way
she
was
ill
at
ease
she
had
moments
of
feeling
that
there
was
a
reach
of
happiness
possessed
by
these
people
of
which
she
knew
nothing
little
side
thrusts
had
come
to
her
from
time
to
time
in
places
where
she
least
expected
them
that
question
asked
by
flossy
during
her
night
of
unrest
should
you
be
afraid
to
die
hovered
around
this
quietly
poised
young
lady
in
a
most
unaccountable
manner
all
the
more
persistently
did
it
cling
because
she
could
not
shake
it
off
with
the
thought
that
it
was
silly
common
sense
told
her
that
the
strange
solemn
shadow
which
came
so
steadily
after
men
and
so
surely
enveloped
one
after
another
among
the
grandest
intellects
that
the
world
owned
was
not
a
thing
to
pass
over
lightly
after
all
why
should
she
be
afraid
of
death
then
that
strange
gentleman
who
had
persisted
in
ranking
her
among
the
praying
people
he
had
left
his
shadow
why
did
she
not
pray
she
wondered
over
this
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
wondered
how
it
seemed
to
kneel
down
alone
and
speak
to
an
invisible
presence
wondered
if
those
who
so
knelt
always
felt
as
though
they
were
really
speaking
to
god
there
were
times
when
ruth
was
exceedingly
disgusted
with
these
perplexing
thoughts
and
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
get
away
from
them
she
resented
this
intrusion
upon
her
quiet
this
day
was
one
of
those
in
which
she
was
impatient
of
all
these
things
and
she
had
made
her
toilet
with
great
satisfaction
and
said
within
herself
complacently
we
are
to
have
one
hour
at
last
devoted
to
this
mundane
sphere
and
the
mortals
who
inhabit
it
most
of
the
time
these
chautauquans
talk
and
act
as
though
earth
was
only
a
railroad
station
where
people
changed
cars
and
went
on
to
heaven
cuyler
is
going
to
refresh
us
with
some
actual
living
specimens
of
humanity
he
ca
make
a
sermon
out
of
that
subject
if
he
tries
but
ruth
erskine
had
not
measured
the
power
of
the
earnest
preachers
of
jesus
christ
as
if
cuyler
could
talk
for
an
hour
to
thousands
of
immortal
souls
and
leave
christ
and
heaven
and
immortality
out
to
ruth
these
three
words
constituted
a
sermon
and
she
got
them
that
day
not
that
he
had
an
idea
that
he
was
preaching
christ
except
incidentally
as
a
man
refers
almost
unconsciously
to
the
one
whom
he
loves
best
in
all
the
world
but
ruth
knew
he
was
it
came
in
little
sudden
touches
when
she
least
expected
it
when
heart
and
soul
were
wrought
upon
with
some
strong
enthusiasm
by
the
splendid
picture
of
a
splendid
man
as
when
he
told
of
spurgeon
it
was
a
glowing
description
such
as
thrilled
ruth
and
made
her
feel
that
to
have
just
one
glimpse
of
that
great
man
with
his
great
marvelous
power
over
humanity
would
be
worth
a
lifetime
suddenly
the
speaker
said
the
secret
of
that
man
power
lies
first
in
his
study
of
the
bible
ruth
started
and
came
down
like
a
from
her
wondrous
height
the
bible
copies
of
which
lay
carelessly
on
every
table
of
her
father
elegantly
furnished
house
unstudied
and
unthought
of
how
very
strange
to
ascribe
the
power
of
the
great
intellect
to
the
study
of
one
book
that
was
more
or
less
familiar
to
every
boy
second
in
short
simple
homely
language
ruth
smiled
now
cuyler
was
growing
absurd
as
if
it
were
not
the
most
common
thing
in
the
world
to
use
simple
homely
language
no
spurgeons
could
be
manufactured
in
that
way
she
was
sure
third
mighty
earnestness
to
save
souls
here
was
a
point
concerning
which
ruth
knew
nothing
cuyler
manner
put
tremendous
force
into
the
forceful
words
and
carried
conviction
with
them
she
wondered
how
a
really
earnestness
to
save
souls
made
a
man
appear
she
wondered
whether
she
had
ever
seen
such
a
one
she
went
rapidly
over
the
list
of
her
acquaintances
in
the
church
she
smiled
to
herself
a
sarcastic
contemptuous
smile
she
had
met
them
all
at
parties
concerts
festivals
and
the
like
she
had
seen
them
on
occasions
when
seemed
to
possess
them
but
to
have
a
good
time
like
the
rest
of
the
world
like
the
rest
of
the
world
ruth
reasoned
and
decided
from
her
chance
meetings
with
the
outside
life
of
these
christians
forgetting
that
she
had
never
seen
one
of
them
in
their
closets
before
god
rather
she
knew
nothing
about
these
closets
nor
the
experiences
learned
there
and
could
only
reason
from
outside
life
this
being
the
case
what
a
pity
that
her
verdict
of
those
lives
should
have
called
forth
only
that
contemptuous
smile
wandering
off
in
this
train
of
thought
she
lost
the
speaker
next
point
but
was
called
back
by
his
solemn
ringing
close
put
these
together
melt
them
down
with
the
love
of
christ
and
you
have
a
spurgeon
god
be
thanked
for
such
a
piece
of
hand
work
as
he
another
start
and
another
retrospect
she
know
any
people
who
put
these
together
who
made
a
real
earnest
constant
study
of
the
bible
as
school
girls
studied
their
latin
grammars
and
who
were
really
eager
to
save
souls
because
they
had
the
love
of
christ
in
their
hearts
and
who
said
so
in
plain
simple
language
does
he
i
wonder
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
if
his
sermons
sound
like
that
i
should
like
to
hear
him
preach
just
once
oh
dear
if
he
is
running
off
to
moody
and
sankey
it
a
sermon
after
all
on
the
whole
ruth
was
disgusted
her
brain
was
in
a
whirl
she
was
being
compelled
to
hear
on
every
hand
she
was
sick
of
it
they
had
been
great
men
of
whom
she
had
heard
and
she
admired
them
all
she
wanted
the
secret
of
their
power
but
she
did
want
it
to
be
made
out
of
such
commonplace
material
as
was
in
the
hands
of
every
child
she
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
only
that
she
had
come
out
to
be
entertained
and
to
revel
in
her
love
of
heroes
and
she
had
been
pinned
down
to
the
one
thought
that
men
were
made
of
those
who
found
their
power
in
their
bible
and
on
their
knees
the
solemn
earnest
tender
closing
to
this
address
did
not
lessen
her
sense
of
discomfort
then
just
beside
her
was
carried
on
a
conversation
that
added
to
her
annoyance
they
are
big
men
a
man
said
he
was
dressed
in
a
common
business
suit
his
linen
had
not
the
exquisite
freshness
about
it
that
her
fastidious
eyes
delighted
in
his
hands
looked
as
though
they
might
have
been
used
to
work
that
was
rough
and
hard
his
straggling
hair
was
sprinkled
with
gray
and
there
was
not
a
striking
feature
about
him
they
are
big
men
he
said
and
i
no
doubt
it
is
a
big
thing
to
know
them
and
talk
with
them
and
have
a
friendly
feeling
for
each
as
if
they
belonged
to
him
but
he
knows
a
bigger
one
than
them
and
the
best
of
it
is
so
do
we
the
lord
jesus
christ
our
elder
brother
is
not
to
be
compared
to
common
men
like
these
and
now
ruth
lips
curled
utterly
she
was
an
aristocrat
without
knowing
it
she
believed
in
christianity
and
in
its
power
to
save
the
poor
and
the
commonest
but
this
insufferable
assumption
of
dignity
and
superiority
over
the
rest
of
the
world
as
she
called
it
was
hateful
to
her
in
the
extreme
it
would
have
startled
her
exceedingly
to
have
been
told
that
she
was
angry
with
the
man
for
presuming
to
place
friend
higher
in
the
list
of
great
ones
than
any
of
those
given
that
day
and
yet
such
was
actually
her
feeling
she
swept
her
skirts
angrily
away
from
contact
with
the
man
and
spoke
so
crustily
to
the
little
lady
who
had
come
in
her
wake
that
she
moved
timidly
away
just
at
her
left
were
two
gentlemen
shaking
hands
both
had
been
on
the
stand
together
she
knew
the
faces
of
both
and
ranked
just
a
trifle
higher
in
her
estimation
than
any
one
at
chautauqua
she
edged
a
little
nearer
she
lived
in
the
hope
of
making
the
acquaintance
of
some
of
these
lights
just
enough
acquaintance
to
receive
a
bow
and
a
clasp
of
the
hand
though
how
one
could
accomplish
it
who
was
determined
that
her
interest
in
them
should
neither
be
seen
nor
suspected
it
would
be
hard
to
say
but
they
were
talking
in
eager
hearty
tones
not
at
all
as
if
their
words
were
confidential
at
least
she
might
have
the
benefit
of
them
that
was
a
capital
lecture
the
elder
of
the
two
was
saying
cuyler
has
had
great
advantages
in
his
life
in
meeting
on
a
familiar
footing
so
many
of
our
great
men
when
you
get
thinking
of
these
things
and
of
the
many
men
whom
you
would
like
to
know
intimately
what
is
the
thought
that
strikes
you
most
forcibly
that
i
am
glad
i
belong
to
the
family
and
have
the
opportunity
of
knowing
intimately
and
holding
close
personal
relations
with
him
who
as
never
man
spake
the
other
answered
in
a
rare
rich
tone
of
suppressed
jubilance
of
feeling
exactly
his
friend
said
and
when
you
can
leave
the
fullness
of
that
thought
long
enough
to
take
another
there
is
the
looking
forward
to
actual
fellowship
and
communion
not
only
with
him
but
with
all
these
glorious
men
who
are
living
here
and
who
have
gone
up
yonder
ruth
turned
abruptly
away
the
very
thought
that
possessed
the
heart
of
the
man
and
that
so
annoyed
her
and
these
two
whom
to
know
was
an
honor
were
looking
forward
to
that
consummation
as
the
height
of
it
all
chapter
xvi
a
war
of
words
well
why
not
she
said
as
she
went
slowly
down
the
aisle
of
course
all
these
people
would
be
in
heaven
together
and
why
should
they
not
look
forward
to
a
companionship
untrameled
by
earthly
forms
and
conventionalities
and
uncumbered
by
the
body
in
its
present
dull
and
ponderous
state
what
a
chance
to
get
into
the
best
society
the
highest
circle
real
best
too
not
made
up
of
money
or
blood
or
dress
or
any
of
the
flimsy
and
silly
barriers
that
fenced
people
in
and
out
now
then
at
once
she
felt
her
own
inconsistency
in
growing
disgusted
with
the
man
if
he
did
really
belong
to
that
royal
family
why
not
rejoice
over
it
was
the
foolish
one
she
by
no
means
liked
these
reflections
but
she
could
not
get
away
from
them
how
do
you
do
said
a
clear
round
voice
behind
her
not
speaking
to
her
but
to
some
one
whom
he
was
very
glad
to
see
judging
from
his
tone
and
the
voice
was
peculiar
she
had
been
listening
to
it
for
an
hour
and
could
not
be
mistaken
it
belonged
to
cuyler
himself
she
turned
herself
suddenly
here
was
a
chance
for
a
nearer
view
and
to
see
who
was
being
greeted
so
heartily
it
was
the
little
lady
whose
society
had
been
thrust
upon
her
that
morning
by
flossy
and
they
were
shaking
hands
as
though
they
were
old
and
familiar
acquaintances
it
is
good
to
see
your
face
again
that
same
hearty
voice
which
seemed
to
have
so
much
good
fellowship
in
it
was
saying
i
did
know
you
were
to
be
here
i
real
glad
to
see
you
again
and
what
about
the
husband
and
the
dear
boy
at
which
point
it
occurred
to
miss
ruth
erskine
that
she
was
listening
to
conversation
not
designed
for
her
ears
she
moved
away
suddenly
in
no
way
comforted
or
sweetened
as
to
her
temper
by
this
episode
why
should
that
little
bit
of
an
insignificant
woman
have
the
honor
of
such
a
cordial
greeting
from
the
great
man
while
he
did
not
even
know
of
existence
to
be
sure
cuyler
had
baptized
and
received
into
church
fellowship
and
united
in
marriage
the
little
woman
with
whom
he
was
talking
but
ruth
even
if
she
had
known
these
circumstances
was
in
no
mood
to
attach
much
importance
to
them
she
wandered
away
from
the
crowd
down
by
the
she
stopped
at
jerusalem
on
her
way
and
poked
her
parasol
listlessly
into
the
sand
of
which
the
hills
lying
about
that
city
were
composed
and
thought
what
silly
child
play
all
this
was
how
absurd
to
suppose
that
people
were
going
to
get
new
ideas
by
at
cities
with
bits
of
painted
board
and
piles
of
sand
even
if
they
get
a
more
distinct
notion
of
its
surroundings
what
difference
did
it
make
how
jerusalem
looked
or
where
it
stood
or
what
had
become
of
the
buildings
this
last
as
it
began
dimly
to
dawn
upon
her
that
it
was
useless
to
deny
the
fact
that
even
such
listless
and
disdainful
staring
as
she
had
vouchsafed
to
this
city
had
located
it
as
it
had
not
been
located
before
in
her
brain
when
she
produced
the
flimsy
question
what
difference
does
it
make
you
can
see
at
once
the
absurd
mood
that
had
gotten
possession
of
her
and
you
lose
all
your
desire
to
argue
with
any
one
who
feels
as
foolish
as
that
neither
had
ruth
any
desire
to
argue
with
herself
she
was
disgusted
with
her
mind
for
insisting
on
keeping
her
up
to
a
strain
of
thought
a
lovely
place
to
rest
she
said
aloud
and
indignantly
giving
a
more
emphatic
poke
with
her
parasol
and
quite
dislodging
one
of
the
buildings
in
jerusalem
one
brain
is
just
kept
at
high
pressure
all
the
time
now
why
this
young
lady
brain
should
have
been
in
need
of
rest
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
explain
even
to
herself
she
sat
herself
down
presently
under
one
of
the
trees
by
the
and
gave
herself
up
to
plans
she
was
tired
of
chautauqua
of
that
she
was
certain
it
stirred
her
up
and
the
process
was
uncomfortable
her
former
composed
life
suited
her
taste
better
she
must
get
away
there
was
no
earthly
reason
why
she
should
not
go
at
once
to
saratoga
a
host
of
friends
were
already
there
and
certain
other
friends
would
be
only
too
glad
to
follow
as
soon
as
ever
they
heard
of
her
advent
in
that
region
before
she
left
that
rustic
settee
under
the
trees
she
had
the
programme
all
arranged
we
will
get
through
as
we
best
can
she
said
sighing
over
the
thought
that
being
the
sabbath
would
perforce
be
spent
there
and
then
on
monday
morning
flossy
and
i
will
just
run
away
to
saratoga
and
leave
those
two
absurd
girls
to
finish
their
absurd
scheme
in
the
best
way
they
can
and
having
disposed
of
flossy
as
though
she
were
a
bit
of
fashionable
merchandise
without
any
volition
of
her
own
ruth
felt
more
composed
and
went
at
once
to
dinner
there
came
an
astonishing
interference
to
this
planning
from
no
other
than
flossy
herself
to
the
utter
amazement
of
each
of
the
girls
she
quietly
refused
to
be
taken
to
saratoga
nor
did
she
offer
any
other
excuse
for
this
astonishing
piece
of
than
that
she
was
having
a
good
time
and
meant
to
finish
it
and
to
this
she
adhered
with
a
pertinacity
that
was
very
bewildering
because
it
was
so
very
new
marion
laughed
over
her
writing
to
which
she
had
returned
the
moment
dinner
was
concluded
that
is
right
flossy
she
said
i
glad
to
see
chautauqua
is
having
an
effect
of
some
sort
on
one
of
us
you
are
growing
mind
is
a
bad
thing
to
have
keep
to
yours
ruth
i
am
astonished
at
i
shall
have
to
confess
that
you
are
disappointing
me
my
child
now
i
rather
expected
this
dear
little
bit
of
lace
and
velvet
to
give
up
conquered
in
less
than
a
week
but
i
said
to
myself
erskine
has
pluck
enough
to
carry
her
through
a
of
and
here
you
are
quenched
at
the
end
of
four
days
it
is
the
ruth
said
irritably
i
am
not
so
much
a
baby
as
to
care
about
those
things
to
such
a
degree
that
i
ca
endure
them
though
everything
is
disagreeable
enough
but
that
is
the
point
at
all
marion
turned
and
looked
at
her
curiously
what
on
earth
is
the
point
then
what
has
happened
to
so
disgust
you
with
chautauqua
the
point
is
that
i
am
tired
of
it
all
it
is
unutterably
stupid
i
suppose
i
have
a
right
to
be
tired
of
a
silly
scheme
that
ought
never
to
have
been
undertaken
if
i
choose
to
be
have
i
not
without
being
called
in
question
by
any
one
and
feeling
more
thoroughly
vexed
not
only
with
the
girls
but
with
herself
than
ever
she
remembered
feeling
before
ruth
arose
suddenly
and
sought
refuge
under
the
trees
outside
the
tent
marion
maintained
a
puzzled
silence
this
was
a
new
phase
in
character
and
one
hard
to
manage
flossy
looked
on
the
point
of
crying
she
was
not
used
to
crossing
the
wills
of
those
who
had
influence
over
her
but
she
was
very
determined
as
to
one
thing
she
was
not
going
to
leave
chautauqua
nothing
could
tempt
me
to
go
to
saratoga
just
now
she
said
earnestly
why
asked
marion
and
receiving
no
answer
at
all
felt
that
flossy
puzzled
her
as
much
as
ruth
had
done
however
she
set
herself
to
work
to
restore
peace
this
letter
is
done
she
said
gayly
folding
her
manuscript
it
is
a
perfectly
gushing
account
of
yesterday
meeting
for
some
of
which
i
am
indebted
to
the
buffalo
reporters
for
i
have
given
the
most
thrilling
parts
where
i
was
present
now
i
going
to
celebrate
come
in
ruth
we
are
of
the
same
mind
precisely
i
would
gladly
accompany
you
on
the
afternoon
train
to
saratoga
with
the
greatest
pleasure
were
it
not
for
certain
inconveniences
connected
with
my
and
a
desire
to
replenish
it
by
writing
up
this
enterprise
but
since
we
ca
go
to
saratoga
let
you
and
i
go
to
mayville
it
is
a
city
of
several
hundred
inhabitants
six
or
eight
certainly
i
should
think
and
we
can
have
an
immense
amount
of
fun
out
of
the
people
and
the
sights
this
afternoon
and
escape
the
preaching
i
have
got
to
write
another
letter
until
monday
come
shall
we
take
the
three
boat
neither
of
these
young
ladies
could
have
told
what
possible
object
there
could
be
in
leaving
the
lovely
woods
in
which
they
were
camped
and
going
off
to
the
singularly
quiet
uninteresting
little
village
of
mayville
except
that
it
was
as
they
said
a
getting
away
from
the
preaching
though
why
two
young
ladies
with
modern
educations
should
find
it
so
important
to
get
themselves
away
from
some
of
the
first
speakers
in
the
country
they
did
not
stop
to
explain
even
to
themselves
however
the
plan
came
to
ruth
as
a
relief
and
she
unhesitatingly
agreed
to
it
so
they
went
their
ways
flossy
to
the
afternoon
meeting
since
eurie
declared
herself
so
far
convalescent
as
to
be
entirely
able
to
remain
alone
and
the
two
of
the
party
who
had
prided
themselves
up
to
this
time
on
their
superiority
of
intellect
down
to
the
wharf
to
take
the
boat
for
mayville
the
ride
thither
on
the
lovely
lake
was
almost
enough
to
excuse
them
for
their
folly
but
the
question
what
to
do
with
themselves
afterward
was
one
that
burdened
them
during
all
that
long
summer
afternoon
they
went
to
the
mayville
house
and
took
a
walk
on
the
piazza
and
the
boarders
looked
at
them
in
curiosity
and
wondered
if
it
were
really
a
pleasanter
walk
than
the
green
fields
over
at
chautauqua
they
ordered
dinner
and
ate
it
at
the
general
table
with
great
relish
ruth
rejoicing
over
this
return
to
civilized
life
one
episode
of
the
table
must
be
noted
opposite
them
sat
a
gentleman
who
either
from
something
in
their
appearance
or
more
probably
from
the
reasonable
conclusion
that
all
the
strangers
who
had
gathered
at
the
quiet
little
village
were
in
some
way
associated
with
the
great
gathering
addressed
them
as
being
part
of
that
great
whole
you
people
are
going
to
reap
a
fine
harvest
pecuniarily
but
how
about
the
fourth
commandment
you
christians
lay
great
stress
on
that
document
whenever
a
sunday
or
something
of
that
sort
is
being
contemplated
do
you
the
remark
was
addressed
to
both
of
them
but
ruth
was
too
much
occupied
with
the
strangeness
of
the
thought
that
she
was
again
being
counted
among
christian
people
to
make
any
answer
not
so
marion
her
eyes
danced
with
merriment
but
she
answered
with
great
gravity
we
believe
in
keeping
holy
the
sabbath
day
of
course
what
has
that
to
do
with
chautauqua
have
you
consulted
the
programme
and
read
admission
at
the
gates
or
docks
the
gentleman
smiled
incredulously
i
have
read
it
he
said
significantly
and
doubtless
many
believe
it
implicitly
i
hope
their
faith
wo
be
shaken
by
hearing
the
returns
from
tickets
counted
over
in
the
evening
there
was
a
genuine
flush
of
feeling
on
marion
face
now
do
you
mean
to
say
she
asked
haughtily
that
you
have
no
faith
in
the
published
statement
that
the
gates
will
be
closed
or
do
you
mean
that
the
association
have
changed
their
minds
because
if
you
have
heard
the
latter
i
can
assure
you
it
is
a
mistake
as
i
heard
the
matter
discussed
by
those
in
authority
this
very
morning
and
they
determined
to
adhere
rigidly
to
the
rules
i
have
no
doubt
they
will
so
far
as
lies
in
their
power
the
gentleman
said
with
an
attempt
at
courtesy
in
his
manner
but
the
trouble
is
the
thing
is
absurd
on
the
face
of
it
if
i
hold
a
ticket
for
an
entertainment
which
the
association
have
sold
to
me
it
is
none
of
their
business
on
what
day
i
present
it
provided
the
entertainment
is
in
progress
they
have
no
right
to
keep
me
out
and
they
are
swindling
me
out
of
so
much
money
if
they
do
it
you
have
changed
your
argument
marion
said
with
a
flash
of
humor
in
her
eyes
you
were
talking
about
the
amount
of
money
that
the
association
were
to
earn
not
the
amount
which
you
were
to
lose
by
not
being
allowed
to
come
in
however
i
am
willing
to
talk
from
that
standpoint
if
you
hold
the
ticket
of
the
association
and
are
stopping
outside
you
will
be
admitted
of
course
it
is
held
to
be
as
reasonable
a
way
to
go
to
church
as
though
you
harnessed
your
horses
at
home
and
drove
on
the
sabbath
to
your
regular
place
of
worship
but
you
buy
no
ticket
the
sabbath
and
none
is
received
from
you
and
if
you
choose
not
to
go
the
association
neither
makes
nor
loses
by
the
operation
and
so
far
as
money
is
concerned
is
entirely
indifferent
which
you
decide
to
do
what
fault
can
possibly
be
found
with
such
an
arrangement
well
said
the
gentleman
with
a
quiet
positiveness
of
tone
i
have
a
season
ticket
and
i
do
mean
to
buy
one
and
i
mean
to
go
down
there
to
meeting
and
i
expect
to
get
in
i
dare
say
marion
answered
with
glowing
cheeks
the
grounds
are
extensive
you
know
and
they
are
not
walled
in
i
have
the
least
doubt
but
that
hundreds
can
creep
through
the
brush
and
so
have
the
gospel
free
there
is
something
about
that
climbeth
up
some
other
way
being
a
thief
and
a
robber
but
of
course
the
writer
could
not
have
had
chautauqua
in
mind
and
even
if
it
applies
it
would
be
only
stealing
from
an
association
which
is
not
stealing
at
all
you
know
you
are
hard
on
me
the
gentleman
said
flushing
in
his
turn
and
the
listeners
of
whom
there
were
many
laughed
and
seemed
to
enjoy
the
flashing
of
words
i
have
no
intention
of
creeping
or
climbing
in
i
shall
present
the
same
sort
of
ticket
which
took
me
in
and
if
it
does
pass
me
i
will
send
you
a
dispatch
to
let
you
know
if
you
will
give
me
your
address
and
if
you
get
in
and
will
let
me
know
i
will
report
at
once
to
the
proper
authorities
that
the
have
been
unfaithful
to
their
trust
said
marion
triumphantly
but
my
dear
madam
what
justice
is
there
in
that
i
have
paid
my
money
and
what
business
is
it
to
them
when
i
present
my
ticket
that
is
keeping
me
out
of
my
just
dues
oh
not
a
bit
of
it
that
is
if
you
can
read
and
have
as
you
admit
read
their
printed
statement
that
you
are
not
invited
to
the
ground
on
sunday
your
ticket
will
admit
you
on
monday
and
you
surely
will
not
argue
that
the
association
has
not
a
right
to
limit
the
number
of
guests
that
it
will
entertain
over
the
sabbath
yes
i
argue
that
it
is
their
business
to
let
me
in
whenever
i
present
their
ticket
marion
laughed
outright
that
is
marvelous
she
said
it
is
wicked
for
them
to
receive
payment
for
your
coming
in
on
the
sabbath
and
it
is
wicked
for
them
not
to
let
you
in
on
your
ticket
really
i
do
see
what
the
association
are
to
do
they
are
committing
sin
either
way
it
is
put
i
see
no
way
out
of
it
but
to
have
refused
to
sell
you
any
tickets
at
all
would
that
have
made
it
right
the
laugh
that
was
raised
over
this
innocently
put
question
seemed
to
irritate
her
new
acquaintance
he
spoke
hastily
it
is
a
concern
viewed
in
any
light
that
you
choose
to
put
it
there
is
no
sense
in
holding
over
the
sabbath
and
every
one
agrees
that
they
have
a
demoralizing
effect
do
you
mean
me
to
understand
you
to
think
that
the
several
thousand
people
who
are
now
stopping
at
chautauqua
will
be
breaking
the
sabbath
by
going
out
of
their
tents
and
walking
down
to
the
public
service
the
bit
of
sophistry
in
this
meekly
put
question
was
overlooked
or
at
least
not
answered
and
the
logical
young
gentleman
asked
if
they
think
sabbath
services
in
the
woods
so
helpful
why
are
they
not
consistent
let
them
throw
the
meeting
open
for
all
who
wish
to
come
making
the
gospel
without
money
and
without
price
as
they
pretend
it
is
why
is
that
done
well
there
are
at
least
half
a
dozen
reasons
i
wonder
you
have
not
thought
of
one
of
them
in
the
first
place
that
of
course
would
tempt
to
a
great
deal
of
sabbath
traveling
a
thing
which
they
carefully
guard
against
now
by
refusing
to
admit
all
travelers
and
in
the
second
place
it
would
give
the
chautauqua
people
a
great
deal
to
do
in
the
way
of
entertaining
so
large
a
class
of
people
as
it
is
they
have
quite
as
much
as
they
care
to
do
to
make
comfortable
the
large
company
who
belong
to
their
family
and
in
the
third
place
but
perhaps
you
do
not
care
to
hear
all
the
reasons
he
ignored
this
question
also
and
went
back
to
one
of
her
arguments
they
do
keep
travelers
away
at
all
even
by
your
own
admission
what
is
to
hinder
hundreds
of
them
from
coming
here
and
buying
season
tickets
in
order
to
get
in
he
had
the
benefit
of
a
most
quizzical
glance
then
from
marion
shining
eyes
before
she
answered
oh
well
if
the
people
are
really
so
hungering
and
thirsting
for
the
gospel
as
it
is
dispensed
at
chautauqua
that
they
are
willing
to
act
a
lie
by
pretending
that
they
are
members
have
been
and
are
to
be
in
regular
and
then
are
willing
to
pay
two
dollars
and
a
half
for
the
sunday
meeting
i
do
know
but
i
think
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
in
do
you
chapter
xvii
getting
ready
to
live
amid
the
laughter
that
followed
this
retort
the
company
rose
up
from
the
table
and
went
their
various
ways
to
meet
perhaps
again
how
on
earth
do
you
manage
to
keep
so
thoroughly
posted
in
regard
to
chautauqua
affairs
one
would
think
you
were
the
wife
of
the
private
secretary
should
have
known
whether
the
gates
were
to
be
opened
or
closed
this
from
ruth
as
the
two
girls
paced
the
long
piazza
while
waiting
for
the
carriage
which
was
to
take
them
to
the
boat
for
having
exhausted
the
resources
of
mayville
for
entertainment
they
were
about
to
return
to
chautauqua
marion
laughed
i
here
in
the
capacity
of
a
newspaper
writer
please
remember
she
answered
promptly
and
what
i
do
know
i
can
imagine
like
the
rest
of
that
brilliant
fraternity
i
am
not
really
positive
about
a
great
many
of
the
statements
that
i
made
except
on
the
general
principle
that
these
people
belong
to
the
class
who
are
very
much
given
to
doing
according
to
their
printed
word
it
says
on
the
circulars
that
the
gates
will
be
closed
on
the
sabbath
and
i
dare
say
they
will
be
at
least
we
have
a
right
to
assume
such
to
be
the
case
until
it
is
proven
false
what
class
of
people
do
you
mean
who
are
given
to
doing
as
they
have
agreed
christian
people
do
you
refer
to
well
yes
the
sort
of
christians
that
one
meets
at
such
a
gathering
as
this
as
a
rule
the
christians
stay
away
from
such
places
or
if
they
come
they
float
off
to
saratoga
or
some
more
kindred
climate
i
beg
your
pardon
ruthie
that
does
mean
you
you
know
because
you
are
not
one
of
any
sort
then
do
you
take
it
to
be
their
religion
which
inclines
you
to
trust
to
their
word
without
having
an
individual
acquaintance
with
them
marion
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
bother
she
said
gayly
you
are
not
turning
theologian
or
police
detective
in
search
of
suspicious
characters
are
you
i
never
pretend
to
pry
into
my
notions
for
and
against
people
and
things
if
i
was
betrayed
into
anything
that
sounded
like
common
sense
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
out
on
a
frolic
and
mean
to
have
it
if
there
is
any
such
thing
well
before
you
go
back
into
absolute
nonsense
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
do
you
really
feel
as
deeply
as
you
pretended
to
that
man
on
all
these
questions
of
the
chautauqua
conscience
i
mean
is
it
a
vital
point
in
your
estimation
whether
people
go
there
to
church
on
sunday
or
not
marion
hesitated
and
a
fine
glow
deepened
on
her
face
as
she
said
after
a
little
speaking
with
grave
dignity
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
explain
myself
to
you
ruth
and
i
dare
say
that
i
seem
to
you
like
a
bundle
of
contradictions
but
it
is
a
real
pleasure
to
me
to
come
in
contact
with
people
who
have
earnest
faith
and
eager
enthusiasm
over
and
principle
enough
to
stand
by
their
views
through
evil
and
good
report
in
this
way
and
to
a
great
degree
this
meeting
is
a
positive
delight
to
me
though
i
know
personally
as
little
about
the
feeling
from
which
they
think
their
actions
take
rise
as
any
mortal
can
does
that
answer
satisfy
you
my
blessed
mother
confessor
or
are
you
more
muddled
than
ever
over
what
i
do
and
especially
over
what
i
do
believe
if
i
believed
as
much
as
you
do
i
should
look
further
ruth
said
this
with
emphasis
and
there
was
that
in
it
which
despite
her
attempts
to
throw
it
off
set
marion
to
thinking
and
kept
her
wonderfully
quiet
during
their
return
trip
on
the
whole
the
flight
to
mayville
was
not
viewed
entirely
in
the
light
of
a
success
ruth
had
been
quiet
and
grave
for
some
time
when
she
suddenly
spoke
in
her
most
composed
and
decided
voice
i
shall
go
to
saratoga
on
monday
whether
any
one
else
will
or
not
i
shall
find
plenty
of
friends
to
welcome
me
and
i
shall
take
the
morning
train
from
here
but
she
did
meantime
flossy
afternoon
had
been
an
uninterrupted
satisfaction
to
her
she
attended
the
children
meeting
and
it
was
perfectly
amazing
to
her
newly
awakened
brain
how
many
of
the
stories
used
to
point
truths
for
the
children
touched
home
to
her
hurlbut
of
plainfield
seemed
to
have
especially
planned
his
address
for
the
purpose
of
hitting
at
some
of
the
markedly
weak
points
in
her
character
though
no
doubt
the
good
man
would
have
been
utterly
amazed
had
he
known
her
thoughts
she
listened
and
laughed
with
the
rest
over
the
story
of
the
poor
tailor
who
promised
a
coat
to
a
customer
for
one
two
and
three
weeks
heaping
up
his
promises
one
on
the
other
until
he
had
a
perfect
pyramid
of
them
only
to
topple
about
his
ears
she
heard
with
the
rest
the
magnificent
voice
ring
out
the
solemn
conclusion
children
he
did
not
mean
to
lie
he
did
not
even
think
he
was
a
liar
he
only
his
they
all
heard
and
i
do
know
how
many
shivered
over
it
but
i
know
that
to
flossy
shipley
it
seemed
as
if
some
one
had
struck
her
an
actual
blow
was
it
possible
that
the
easy
sentences
the
easy
promises
to
write
to
come
to
bring
this
to
tell
that
made
so
gracefully
sounding
so
kindly
costing
so
little
because
forgotten
almost
as
soon
as
her
head
was
turned
away
actually
belonged
in
that
list
described
by
the
ugly
word
lie
flossy
had
been
a
special
sinner
in
this
department
of
polite
wickedness
because
it
just
accorded
with
her
nature
such
promises
were
so
easy
to
make
and
seemed
to
please
people
and
were
so
easy
to
forget
like
the
tailor
she
had
meant
to
be
a
liar
nor
dreamed
that
she
was
one
but
her
ears
took
it
all
in
and
her
roused
brain
turned
the
thought
over
and
over
until
be
it
known
to
you
that
that
girl
happy
pastor
when
he
receives
from
her
a
decided
yes
sir
i
will
do
it
may
rest
assured
that
unless
something
beyond
her
control
intervenes
she
will
be
at
her
post
so
much
did
hurlbut
accomplish
that
afternoon
without
ever
knowing
it
there
were
many
things
done
that
afternoon
i
suspect
that
only
the
light
of
the
judgement
day
will
reveal
over
the
story
of
the
two
workmen
who
each
resolved
to
stick
to
a
certain
effort
for
six
months
and
did
it
the
one
earning
thereby
a
patent
right
worth
thousands
of
dollars
and
the
other
teaching
a
little
dog
how
to
dance
to
the
whistling
of
a
certain
tune
flossy
looked
unutterably
sober
while
the
laughter
swelled
to
a
perfect
roar
around
her
it
was
hard
to
feel
that
not
six
months
only
but
a
dozen
years
of
intelligent
life
were
gone
from
her
and
she
had
not
even
taught
a
dog
to
dance
a
jig
that
was
the
very
way
she
put
it
in
her
humility
and
i
do
not
say
that
she
placed
it
too
low
because
really
i
do
know
that
flossy
shipley
had
even
so
settled
a
purpose
in
life
as
that
she
had
simply
fluttered
around
the
edge
of
this
solemn
business
that
we
call
living
but
along
with
the
sober
thought
glowed
the
earnest
purpose
given
another
dozen
years
to
my
young
lady
life
and
they
will
bear
a
different
record
and
whatever
they
bear
hurlburt
will
be
in
a
sense
responsible
for
though
he
never
saw
her
and
probably
never
will
verily
this
living
is
a
complicated
bewildering
thing
well
for
us
that
the
weight
of
the
responsibility
is
not
ours
to
bear
there
was
still
another
story
and
over
it
flossy
lips
parted
and
her
eyes
glowed
with
feeling
that
wonderful
machine
that
the
most
skillful
workmen
tried
in
vain
to
repair
that
was
useless
and
worthless
until
the
name
of
the
owner
was
found
on
it
and
he
was
sent
for
then
indeed
it
found
the
the
only
one
who
could
right
it
she
did
not
need
hurlbut
glowing
application
so
he
who
made
us
and
engraved
his
name
his
image
on
our
bodies
can
alone
take
our
hearts
and
make
them
right
flossy
listened
to
this
and
the
sentences
that
followed
thrilling
her
heart
with
their
power
and
beauty
thrilling
as
they
would
not
have
done
one
week
ago
for
did
she
not
know
by
actual
experience
just
how
blessed
a
worker
the
great
maker
was
had
she
not
carried
her
heart
to
him
and
had
he
not
left
his
indelible
impression
there
oh
this
was
a
wonderful
meeting
to
flossy
one
that
she
will
never
forget
one
that
many
others
will
have
reason
to
remember
because
of
the
way
in
which
she
listened
but
was
it
not
strange
the
way
in
which
her
education
was
being
cared
for
after
tea
she
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
looking
out
for
the
girls
looking
out
also
on
the
cool
quiet
sunset
and
the
glory
spread
everywhere
for
there
had
been
sunshine
that
day
part
of
the
time
and
there
was
a
clear
sun
setting
under
her
arm
she
held
the
treasure
which
she
had
in
the
morning
determined
to
possess
a
good
plain
bible
not
at
all
like
the
one
that
lay
on
her
at
home
but
such
as
the
needs
of
bible
students
at
chautauqua
had
demanded
and
therefore
much
better
fitted
for
actual
service
than
the
velvet
among
the
many
came
smythe
she
halted
before
flossy
i
thought
your
party
must
have
left
i
have
seen
you
since
thursday
have
you
been
fearfully
bored
we
are
going
to
leave
on
monday
morning
going
to
saratoga
do
some
of
you
want
to
join
us
i
do
know
flossy
said
thoughtfully
mindful
of
ruth
and
her
plan
that
had
not
worked
it
is
possible
that
miss
erskine
may
do
your
entire
party
go
oh
not
my
nephew
of
course
nothing
could
tear
him
away
he
is
perfectly
charmed
with
all
this
singing
and
praying
and
preaching
but
i
confess
it
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
for
me
i
am
not
intellectually
inclined
i
like
the
music
very
well
and
some
of
the
addresses
are
fine
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
carrying
meetings
to
excess
at
this
point
she
turned
quickly
at
the
sound
of
a
firm
step
behind
her
and
greeted
a
young
man
speak
of
angels
and
you
hear
their
wings
or
the
squeak
of
their
boots
she
said
we
were
just
talking
about
you
evan
my
nephew
roberts
miss
shipley
i
believe
you
have
never
met
before
had
they
not
there
was
a
heightened
flush
on
the
cheek
of
each
as
they
shook
hands
it
was
clear
that
each
recognized
the
other
are
we
strangers
he
asked
with
a
bright
smile
speaking
so
low
that
smythe
whose
attention
had
already
wandered
from
them
to
a
group
who
were
passing
did
not
hear
the
words
on
the
contrary
i
think
we
are
related
though
i
do
not
know
that
we
have
happened
to
hear
each
other
names
before
flossy
understood
the
relationship
sons
and
daughters
of
one
father
for
she
knew
this
was
the
young
man
who
had
twice
questioned
her
concerning
her
allegiance
to
that
father
also
she
remembered
him
as
the
only
one
whom
she
had
ever
heard
pray
for
her
smythe
called
out
a
gay
to
them
and
joined
a
party
of
friends
and
roberts
leaned
against
a
tree
and
prepared
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
his
relative
you
have
one
of
those
large
bibles
i
see
he
said
i
have
been
very
much
tempted
but
i
could
not
make
myself
feel
that
i
really
needed
one
i
really
needed
mine
flossy
said
smiling
i
left
my
bible
at
home
i
had
not
such
a
thought
as
bringing
it
along
i
feel
now
as
if
i
had
a
treasure
that
i
did
know
how
to
use
it
is
quite
new
to
me
i
know
where
to
read
first
but
i
suppose
it
makes
no
difference
indeed
it
does
make
great
difference
he
said
smiling
and
you
will
enjoy
finding
out
how
to
read
it
chautauqua
is
a
good
place
for
such
a
study
and
the
bible
reading
this
evening
is
an
excellent
place
to
commence
are
you
going
yes
indeed
flossy
said
with
brightening
eyes
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
it
all
day
i
ca
think
what
a
bible
reading
is
do
they
just
read
verses
in
the
bible
yes
he
said
smiling
it
is
just
bible
verses
with
a
word
of
explanation
now
and
then
and
a
little
singing
but
the
bible
verses
are
something
remarkable
as
you
will
see
it
is
nearly
time
for
service
are
you
ready
shall
we
walk
down
and
secure
seats
so
they
went
down
together
it
the
early
twilight
and
took
seats
under
the
trees
amid
the
glowing
of
brilliant
lights
and
the
soft
sound
of
music
coming
from
the
piano
on
the
stand
chapter
xviii
the
silent
witness
that
bible
reading
i
wish
i
could
make
it
appear
to
you
as
it
did
to
flossy
shipley
not
that
either
because
i
trust
that
the
sound
of
the
bible
verses
is
not
so
utterly
new
to
you
as
it
was
to
her
rather
that
it
might
sound
to
you
as
it
did
to
the
young
man
who
sat
beside
her
taking
in
ever
word
with
as
much
eagerness
as
if
some
of
the
verses
had
not
been
his
dear
and
friends
nay
with
more
eagerness
on
that
account
do
you
know
parsons
of
boston
it
was
he
who
conducted
that
reading
and
his
theme
was
the
coming
of
the
lord
let
me
give
you
just
a
few
of
the
groupings
as
he
called
them
forth
from
his
congregation
under
the
trees
and
which
he
called
the
own
testimonies
to
his
coming
watch
therefore
for
ye
know
not
what
hour
your
lord
doth
come
therefore
be
ye
also
ready
for
in
such
an
hour
as
ye
think
not
the
son
of
man
cometh
watch
therefore
for
ye
know
neither
the
day
nor
the
hour
wherein
the
son
of
man
cometh
take
ye
heed
watch
and
pray
for
ye
know
not
when
the
time
is
four
solemn
warnings
from
the
head
of
the
vineyard
they
reached
to
flossy
very
soul
and
she
had
that
old
thrill
of
feeling
that
almost
every
christian
has
some
time
experienced
if
had
only
been
there
if
he
had
spoken
such
words
to
i
could
never
never
have
forgotten
or
been
neglectful
if
i
could
only
have
heard
him
speak
and
as
if
in
answer
to
this
longing
cry
parsons
himself
read
the
next
solemn
sentence
read
it
in
such
a
way
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
this
might
be
the
sacred
garden
and
standing
among
the
speaking
even
to
and
what
i
say
unto
you
i
say
unto
all
watch
here
then
was
her
direction
from
his
own
lips
though
centuries
had
passed
since
he
spoke
them
they
echoed
down
to
her
she
was
not
overwhelmed
she
was
not
crushed
by
the
new
and
solemn
sense
of
her
calling
that
flowed
over
her
the
lord
himself
was
there
in
every
deed
and
whispered
in
her
ear
it
is
i
be
not
afraid
and
her
heart
responded
solemnly
aye
lord
i
feel
thy
presence
i
have
been
sleeping
but
i
am
awake
and
from
henceforth
i
watch
that
bible
reading
was
like
a
whole
week
of
theological
study
to
flossy
it
was
not
that
she
learned
simply
about
the
blessed
assurance
the
weight
of
testimony
amounting
to
an
absolute
certainty
concerning
the
coming
of
the
lord
but
there
were
so
many
truths
growing
out
from
that
so
many
incentives
to
be
up
and
doing
for
she
found
before
the
reading
closed
that
one
must
not
only
watch
but
in
the
watching
work
and
there
were
so
many
reasons
why
she
should
and
so
many
hints
as
to
the
way
and
the
time
then
there
was
also
the
most
blessed
discovery
that
the
bible
was
not
a
book
to
treat
like
an
arithmetic
that
one
must
read
through
the
book
of
genesis
and
then
go
on
to
exodus
a
chapter
two
chapters
and
perhaps
some
days
when
one
was
not
in
too
great
a
hurry
and
could
read
very
fast
take
half
a
dozen
chapters
and
so
get
through
it
but
she
learned
that
there
were
little
connecting
links
of
sweetness
all
the
way
through
the
book
that
she
had
a
right
to
look
over
in
revelation
for
an
explanation
of
something
that
was
stated
in
deuteronomy
she
did
not
learn
all
this
either
at
this
one
time
but
she
got
a
vivid
hint
of
it
strong
enough
to
keep
her
hunting
and
pulling
at
the
lovely
golden
thread
of
the
bible
for
long
years
to
come
there
were
special
points
about
the
closing
verses
that
throbbed
in
her
heart
and
awakened
purposes
that
never
slept
again
it
was
the
gentleman
who
sat
beside
her
who
read
the
solemn
words
of
the
verse
but
the
day
of
the
lord
will
come
as
a
thief
in
the
night
in
which
the
heavens
shall
pass
away
with
a
great
noise
and
the
elements
shall
melt
with
fervent
heat
the
earth
also
and
the
works
that
are
therein
shall
be
burned
up
seeing
then
that
all
these
things
shall
be
dissolved
what
manner
of
persons
ought
ye
to
be
in
all
holy
conversation
and
godliness
his
voice
was
very
earnest
and
his
face
had
an
eager
look
of
solemn
joy
from
it
she
felt
the
truth
that
while
the
words
which
he
had
been
reading
were
full
of
solemnity
and
while
he
felt
the
sense
of
responsibility
there
was
also
that
in
them
which
filled
his
heart
with
great
joy
for
when
that
time
should
come
would
not
he
be
with
his
lord
again
when
a
little
later
he
gave
the
closing
verses
of
this
wonderful
lesson
reading
them
from
her
bible
because
in
the
dimness
the
print
was
larger
and
clearer
than
his
own
they
made
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
ye
are
the
children
of
light
and
the
children
of
the
day
we
are
not
of
the
night
nor
of
the
darkness
therefore
let
us
not
sleep
as
do
others
but
let
us
watch
and
be
sober
he
marked
it
with
his
pencil
as
he
finished
reading
and
as
he
returned
the
book
to
her
keeping
he
said
with
a
smile
we
will
shall
we
not
and
it
felt
to
flossy
like
a
convenant
witnessed
by
the
lord
himself
but
parsons
you
know
knew
nothing
of
all
this
chautauqua
was
the
place
for
sowing
the
seed
they
could
only
hope
that
the
lord
of
the
vineyard
was
looking
on
and
watching
over
the
coming
harvest
it
was
not
for
their
eyes
to
see
the
fruits
sunday
morning
at
chautauqua
none
of
all
the
many
hundreds
who
spent
the
day
within
the
shadow
of
that
sweet
and
leafy
place
have
surely
forgotten
how
the
quaint
and
quiet
beauty
of
the
place
and
its
surroundings
fell
upon
them
they
know
just
how
the
birds
sang
among
those
tall
old
trees
they
know
just
how
still
and
blue
and
clear
the
lake
looked
as
they
caught
glimpses
of
it
through
the
quivering
green
of
myriad
leaves
they
know
just
how
clearly
the
chautauqua
bells
cut
the
air
and
called
to
the
worship
it
needs
not
even
these
few
words
to
recall
the
place
in
its
beauty
to
the
hearts
of
those
who
worshiped
there
that
day
and
for
you
who
did
not
see
it
nor
feel
its
power
there
is
no
use
to
try
to
describe
chautauqua
only
this
it
is
a
place
to
love
and
look
back
to
with
a
sort
of
sweet
and
tender
longing
all
your
lives
our
girls
felt
somewhat
of
the
sacredness
of
the
place
at
least
they
went
around
with
a
more
decided
feeling
that
it
was
sunday
than
they
had
ever
realized
before
three
of
them
did
to
flossy
this
day
was
like
the
revelation
of
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
her
first
sunday
in
christ
there
was
no
sunshine
neither
was
there
rain
just
a
hush
of
all
things
and
sweetness
everywhere
after
breakfast
ruth
and
marion
lolled
on
their
cots
and
studied
the
programme
while
the
other
two
made
hasty
toilets
and
announced
their
intention
of
going
to
what
in
the
name
of
sense
takes
you
queried
marion
rising
on
one
elbow
the
better
to
view
this
strange
phenomena
why
i
have
a
mission
eurie
said
about
three
thousand
people
have
been
talking
all
this
week
about
teaching
a
few
bible
verses
to
some
children
and
i
am
going
to
find
out
what
they
are
and
what
is
so
wonderful
about
them
besides
i
was
taken
for
a
being
named
miss
rider
and
on
inquiry
i
find
her
to
be
what
they
call
an
teacher
so
i
am
going
to
hunt
her
up
and
see
if
we
look
alike
and
are
affinities
flossy
chose
to
make
no
answer
at
all
and
presently
the
two
departed
together
to
attend
their
first
since
they
were
known
as
children
as
they
passed
a
certain
tent
eurie
ready
ears
gained
information
from
other
this
is
where
the
little
children
are
miss
rider
is
going
to
teach
them
eurie
halted
going
in
here
she
said
decidedly
to
flossy
that
is
the
very
lady
i
am
in
search
of
and
seeing
flossy
hesitate
she
added
oh
you
may
go
on
it
is
just
as
well
to
divide
our
forces
we
may
each
have
some
wonderful
adventure
you
go
your
way
and
i
will
go
mine
and
see
what
will
come
of
it
the
tent
was
full
apparently
but
that
spirit
which
was
rife
at
chautauqua
and
which
prompted
everybody
to
try
to
look
out
a
little
for
the
comfort
of
everybody
else
made
a
seat
full
of
ladies
crowd
a
little
and
make
room
for
her
rows
and
rows
of
little
people
with
smiling
faces
and
shining
eyes
it
was
a
pretty
sight
eurie
gave
eager
attention
to
the
lady
who
was
talking
to
them
and
laughed
a
little
to
herself
over
the
dissimilarity
of
their
appearance
hair
and
eyes
and
height
and
everything
else
totally
unlike
me
she
said
she
is
older
than
i
too
ever
so
much
she
does
look
as
i
thought
miss
rider
would
but
what
she
was
saying
proved
to
be
very
interesting
not
only
to
the
little
people
but
to
eurie
she
listened
eagerly
it
was
important
to
discover
what
had
been
so
stirring
the
world
all
the
week
she
was
not
left
in
doubt
the
story
was
plainly
clearly
fascinatingly
told
it
was
that
tender
one
of
the
sick
man
so
long
waiting
waiting
to
be
helped
into
the
pool
disappointed
year
after
year
until
one
blessed
day
jesus
came
that
way
and
asked
one
simple
question
and
received
an
eager
answer
and
gave
one
brief
command
and
lo
the
work
was
done
the
long
long
years
of
pain
and
trial
were
over
do
you
think
this
seemed
like
a
wonderful
story
to
eurie
do
you
think
her
cheeks
glowed
with
joy
over
the
thought
of
the
great
love
and
the
great
power
of
jesus
alas
alas
to
her
there
was
no
beauty
in
him
this
simple
tender
story
did
not
move
her
as
the
commonplace
account
of
a
common
sickness
and
common
recovery
given
in
a
village
paper
would
have
done
the
very
most
that
she
thought
of
it
was
this
that
miss
rider
has
a
good
deal
of
dramatic
power
how
well
she
tells
the
story
but
dear
me
how
stupid
it
must
be
what
is
the
use
of
taking
so
much
trouble
for
these
little
midgets
they
do
understand
the
story
and
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
them
if
they
did
something
that
happened
to
somebody
hundreds
of
years
ago
but
now
her
attention
was
arrested
by
the
sound
of
a
very
loud
whisper
just
behind
her
given
in
a
childish
voice
miss
rider
miss
rider
the
child
was
saying
and
emphasizing
her
whisper
by
a
pull
at
a
dress
eurie
turned
quickly
the
dress
belonged
to
a
young
fair
girl
with
fresh
glowing
face
and
large
bright
eyes
that
shone
now
with
feeling
as
she
listened
eagerly
to
this
story
and
to
the
comments
of
the
children
concerning
it
then
she
in
turn
whispered
to
the
lady
nearest
her
is
it
miss
rider
who
is
teaching
no
it
is
clark
of
newark
that
is
miss
rider
leaning
against
a
post
then
eurie
looked
back
to
her
she
is
no
older
than
i
she
murmured
indeed
not
so
old
i
should
think
her
hair
must
be
exactly
the
color
of
mine
and
we
are
about
the
same
height
i
wonder
if
we
look
in
the
least
alike
what
do
i
care
yet
still
she
looked
the
bright
face
fascinated
her
the
little
child
had
won
the
lady
attention
and
the
lips
and
eyes
and
indeed
the
whole
face
were
vivid
with
animation
as
she
bent
low
and
answered
some
troubled
question
appealing
to
the
diagram
on
the
board
and
making
clear
her
answer
by
rapid
gestures
with
her
fingers
the
lady
beside
eurie
volunteered
some
more
information
miss
rider
was
to
have
taught
this
class
i
heard
i
wonder
why
she
did
i
do
know
eurie
answered
briefly
then
she
looked
back
at
her
again
she
is
jealous
she
said
to
herself
she
was
to
have
taught
this
class
this
morning
and
by
some
blundering
she
was
left
out
and
she
is
disgusted
she
will
say
that
such
teaching
as
this
amounts
to
nothing
she
could
have
done
it
five
times
as
well
or
if
she
that
last
she
will
think
it
and
act
it
i
have
no
doubt
these
rival
teachers
cordially
hate
each
other
like
politicians
nevertheless
that
fresh
young
face
with
its
glow
of
feeling
fascinated
her
she
kept
looking
at
her
she
gave
no
more
attention
to
the
lesson
what
was
it
after
all
but
an
old
story
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
the
fact
that
it
was
taken
from
the
bible
was
proof
enough
of
that
but
she
watched
miss
rider
the
session
closed
and
that
lady
pressed
forward
to
assist
in
giving
out
papers
the
crowd
pushed
the
willing
eurie
nearer
to
her
so
near
that
she
could
catch
the
sentence
that
she
was
eagerly
saying
to
the
lady
near
her
is
clark
delightful
it
was
such
a
beautiful
lesson
this
morning
i
think
it
is
such
a
treat
and
such
a
privilege
to
be
allowed
to
listen
to
her
yes
darling
this
last
to
another
little
one
claiming
a
word
of
course
jesus
can
hear
you
now
just
as
well
as
though
he
stood
here
he
often
says
to
people
thou
be
made
whole
he
has
said
so
to
you
this
morning
eurie
turned
away
quickly
she
had
had
her
lesson
it
was
from
the
bible
nor
yet
did
she
find
it
in
those
hundred
little
faces
so
eager
to
know
the
story
in
all
its
details
it
was
just
in
that
young
face
not
so
old
as
hers
so
bright
so
strong
so
thoroughly
alert
and
so
thoroughly
enlisted
in
this
matter
the
vivid
contrast
between
that
life
and
hers
struck
eurie
with
the
force
of
a
new
revelation
she
went
to
the
general
service
under
the
trees
she
heard
a
sermon
from
pierce
so
full
of
power
and
eloquence
that
to
many
who
heard
it
there
came
new
resolves
new
purposes
new
plans
i
beg
her
pardon
she
did
not
listen
she
simply
occupied
a
seat
and
looked
as
though
she
was
a
listener
but
the
truth
was
she
had
not
learned
yet
to
listen
to
sermons
the
very
fact
that
it
was
a
sermon
made
it
clear
to
her
mind
that
there
was
to
be
nothing
in
it
for
her
this
had
been
her
education
in
reality
during
that
hour
of
worship
she
was
engaged
in
watching
the
changeful
play
of
expression
on
miss
rider
face
as
her
eyes
brightened
and
glowed
with
enthusiasm
or
trembled
with
tears
according
as
the
preacher
words
roused
or
subdued
her
well
eurie
had
her
lesson
it
was
not
from
the
bible
it
was
not
from
the
preacher
lips
except
incidentally
but
it
was
from
a
living
epistle
ye
shall
be
witnesses
of
me
was
the
promise
of
christ
in
the
long
ago
just
before
the
cloud
received
him
out
of
sight
is
not
that
promise
verified
to
us
often
and
often
when
we
know
it
not
miss
rider
had
no
means
of
knowing
as
she
sat
a
listener
that
sabbath
morning
that
she
was
witnessing
for
christ
but
she
was
just
as
surely
speaking
for
him
as
though
she
had
stood
up
amid
that
throng
and
said
i
love
jesus
ye
are
my
witnesses
saith
the
lord
and
the
poet
has
said
they
also
serve
who
only
stand
and
wait
blessed
are
those
in
whom
the
waiting
and
the
service
go
together
chapter
xix
an
old
story
meantime
flossy
deserted
by
her
companion
made
her
way
somewhat
timidly
down
to
the
stand
amazed
by
the
great
congregation
of
people
who
had
formed
themselves
into
a
with
all
their
haste
the
girls
had
gotten
a
very
late
start
the
opening
exercises
were
all
over
and
the
numerous
teachers
were
turning
to
their
work
strangely
enough
the
first
person
whom
flossy
eye
took
in
distinctly
enough
for
recognition
was
roberts
he
had
recognized
her
also
and
was
coming
toward
her
how
do
you
do
this
morning
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
do
you
know
i
have
a
mission
for
you
there
are
two
boys
who
seem
to
belong
to
nobody
and
to
have
nothing
in
common
with
this
gathering
except
curiosity
the
superintendent
has
twice
tried
to
charm
them
in
but
without
success
they
will
come
no
further
than
that
tree
i
think
they
have
slipped
in
from
the
village
probably
in
a
most
unorthodox
fashion
and
what
i
am
coming
at
is
will
you
go
out
under
the
tree
to
them
and
beguile
them
into
attending
a
for
once
in
their
lives
they
look
to
me
as
though
it
was
probably
a
rare
occurrence
now
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
this
invitation
came
to
flossy
with
the
same
sound
that
it
would
have
had
to
you
if
roberts
had
come
to
you
that
sabbath
morning
and
asked
you
to
tell
those
two
boys
a
bible
story
it
is
something
that
you
have
probably
been
doing
a
good
deal
of
all
your
life
and
two
boys
at
chautauqua
are
no
more
to
you
than
two
boys
anywhere
else
except
that
there
is
a
delightful
sensation
connected
with
having
a
out
in
the
open
air
but
imagine
yourself
suddenly
confronted
by
vincent
and
asked
if
you
would
be
so
kind
as
to
step
on
the
platform
and
preach
to
five
thousand
people
from
a
text
that
he
would
select
for
you
now
you
have
something
of
an
idea
as
to
how
this
request
felt
to
flossy
a
rare
glow
spread
all
over
her
face
and
she
looked
up
at
her
questioner
with
eyes
that
were
quivering
in
tears
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
she
said
in
low
and
trembling
voice
i
have
not
been
to
a
in
seven
years
and
i
never
taught
anybody
anything
in
my
life
it
was
true
that
he
did
not
know
it
seemed
to
him
such
a
very
little
thing
that
he
had
asked
however
he
spoke
gently
enough
as
one
who
was
courteous
even
when
he
could
not
quite
comprehend
then
is
not
a
good
time
to
commence
you
will
surely
never
have
a
better
opportunity
but
she
shook
her
head
and
turned
quite
away
from
him
walking
down
among
the
trees
where
no
people
were
her
joy
was
all
gone
and
her
pleasant
time
she
had
meant
to
go
to
to
sit
down
quietly
in
some
body
class
and
learn
oh
a
very
great
deal
during
the
next
hour
now
she
was
all
stirred
up
and
could
not
go
anywhere
as
for
roberts
he
went
back
to
the
large
class
who
were
waiting
for
him
and
those
two
boys
hovered
around
the
edge
of
that
feast
like
hungry
creatures
who
yet
had
never
learned
to
come
to
the
table
and
take
their
places
flossy
looked
at
them
at
first
indignantly
as
at
miserable
beings
who
had
spoiled
her
pleasure
then
she
became
fascinated
by
their
bright
dirty
faces
and
roguish
ways
she
edged
a
little
nearer
to
them
boys
she
was
afraid
of
she
knew
nothing
about
them
had
they
been
a
little
older
and
been
dressed
well
and
been
of
the
stamp
of
boys
who
knew
how
to
bring
her
handkerchief
to
her
when
she
dropped
it
she
would
have
known
what
to
say
to
them
but
boys
who
were
not
more
than
twelve
or
fourteen
and
who
were
both
ragged
and
dirty
were
new
phases
of
life
to
her
why
do
you
go
to
she
questioned
at
last
with
a
timid
air
she
could
at
least
ask
that
they
were
not
the
least
timid
as
to
answering
the
older
and
the
dirtier
of
the
two
turned
his
roguish
eyes
on
her
and
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
before
he
said
why
do
you
flossy
was
unprepared
for
this
question
but
she
answered
quickly
and
truthfully
because
i
am
afraid
to
go
both
boys
stared
and
then
laughed
and
the
other
younger
one
said
so
be
we
i
suppose
we
are
both
very
silly
flossy
said
but
i
have
not
been
to
for
so
long
that
i
have
forgotten
all
about
it
let
have
one
of
our
own
that
we
are
not
afraid
to
go
to
and
she
sat
bravely
down
on
the
stump
at
her
feet
her
mood
had
changed
very
suddenly
only
yesterday
she
had
read
a
verse
in
that
bible
and
it
thrilled
her
then
and
came
to
her
now
the
man
departed
and
told
the
jews
that
it
was
jesus
who
had
made
him
whole
suppose
she
were
the
man
and
these
were
the
jews
could
she
not
say
to
them
he
has
made
me
whole
she
could
tell
them
about
that
pool
and
about
the
sick
man
it
would
be
teaching
in
but
it
would
be
doing
the
best
thing
that
she
could
it
suddenly
occurred
to
her
to
wonder
where
the
lesson
was
that
was
being
taught
this
morning
and
she
consulted
the
lesson
leaf
that
roberts
had
left
in
her
hand
the
glow
on
her
face
deepened
and
spread
as
she
recognized
the
very
story
which
had
so
filled
her
heart
the
day
before
what
if
the
great
physician
had
actually
selected
her
to
tell
of
that
miracle
of
healing
to
these
two
neglected
ones
surely
they
were
not
so
formidable
as
the
jews
but
how
in
the
world
to
begin
was
a
bewilderment
clearly
she
must
decide
at
once
if
she
was
to
have
any
class
for
her
two
boys
began
to
look
about
them
and
show
signs
of
flight
did
you
ever
hear
about
a
wonderful
spring
that
used
to
cure
people
lots
of
i
used
to
live
right
by
one
that
cured
the
rheumatiz
but
this
one
would
cure
other
things
only
it
would
cure
people
all
the
time
there
was
just
one
time
in
the
year
when
it
would
do
it
and
then
the
one
that
got
in
first
was
the
only
one
cured
her
listeners
looked
skeptical
what
was
that
for
queried
the
bolder
of
the
two
why
did
it
cure
but
one
i
do
know
flossy
said
there
are
ever
so
many
things
that
i
know
that
i
ca
tell
why
they
are
so
for
instance
i
do
know
why
that
spring
you
have
been
telling
me
about
cures
the
rheumatism
but
i
know
it
does
for
you
told
me
so
no
more
do
i
the
boy
said
promptly
having
in
his
heart
a
rising
respect
for
the
young
teacher
and
her
story
then
this
new
beginner
with
the
air
of
a
diplomatist
told
all
the
details
of
this
wonderful
cure
without
once
mentioning
the
name
of
either
person
or
place
an
innate
sense
of
the
human
heart
told
her
that
jerusalem
and
jesus
were
both
probably
connected
in
the
minds
of
these
two
with
the
bible
and
their
appearance
told
her
that
they
were
likely
to
be
skeptical
as
to
the
interest
of
bible
stories
but
like
all
ignorant
persons
there
was
a
credulous
side
to
their
nature
it
is
surprising
what
marvelous
stories
people
are
prepared
to
receive
and
credit
provided
only
that
they
do
not
come
from
the
bible
with
a
thus
saith
the
lord
to
vouch
for
them
then
indeed
they
are
apt
to
become
unreasonable
and
improbable
presently
her
boys
volunteered
some
remarks
and
asked
some
questions
jolly
that
fellow
must
have
felt
good
i
guess
he
wanted
to
run
all
around
the
country
and
tell
about
it
where
was
this
spring
and
what
was
the
man
name
that
cured
him
the
other
chimed
in
yes
and
how
did
he
do
it
that
what
i
after
and
is
he
dead
i
do
hear
of
no
such
cures
then
was
flossy
tremulous
of
heart
she
had
become
eagerly
interested
in
her
story
and
her
boys
would
the
charm
that
she
had
woven
be
broken
the
moment
they
knew
the
story
origin
but
of
course
she
must
tell
them
for
what
good
else
would
the
story
do
he
is
dead
she
said
slowly
answering
the
last
question
first
that
is
he
is
what
call
dead
but
of
course
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
that
does
mean
what
it
seems
to
it
means
simply
that
he
live
in
the
same
place
that
he
once
did
he
went
to
heaven
to
live
ever
so
many
years
ago
she
waited
to
feel
the
effect
of
this
announcement
the
boys
were
silent
and
grave
they
had
evidently
heard
of
heaven
and
had
some
measure
of
respect
for
the
name
the
new
teacher
did
not
know
what
to
say
next
the
boys
helped
her
the
younger
one
drew
a
heavy
sigh
well
all
i
got
to
say
is
i
wish
he
was
alive
now
he
said
in
a
regretful
tone
my
mother
has
been
sick
longer
than
years
she
has
been
sick
about
all
her
life
and
she
is
real
bad
now
so
she
ca
walk
at
all
i
he
could
cure
her
if
he
was
here
i
suppose
he
could
cure
her
now
flossy
said
this
slowly
reverently
looking
earnestly
at
the
boy
hoping
to
convey
to
him
a
sense
of
her
meaning
he
looked
utterly
puzzled
light
began
to
dawn
on
the
face
of
the
older
boy
she
been
tellin
us
one
of
them
bible
stories
he
said
speaking
not
to
flossy
but
to
his
companion
and
assuming
an
injured
air
as
if
a
wrong
had
been
done
them
flossy
spoke
quickly
of
course
i
have
i
thought
you
wanted
to
hear
something
that
really
happened
and
not
a
made
up
story
this
seemed
to
be
an
appeal
to
their
dignity
and
they
eyed
her
reflectively
how
do
you
know
it
happened
ventured
the
younger
one
flossy
gave
a
rapid
and
animated
answer
there
are
about
a
hundred
reasons
why
i
know
it
it
would
take
me
all
day
to
tell
you
half
of
them
but
one
is
that
i
read
it
in
a
book
which
good
men
who
know
a
great
deal
and
who
have
been
studying
all
their
lives
to
find
out
about
it
say
they
know
is
true
and
i
believe
what
they
tell
me
about
washington
and
lincoln
and
other
men
whom
i
never
saw
so
i
ought
to
believe
them
when
they
tell
me
about
this
man
but
there
thing
you
do
know
you
do
know
that
he
can
cure
folks
now
and
he
do
do
it
this
was
spoken
with
a
quiet
positiveness
and
with
the
air
that
said
ca
be
disputed
and
you
know
it
ca
flossy
hesitated
just
a
moment
the
glow
on
her
face
deepened
and
spread
then
she
answered
in
much
the
same
tone
that
the
boy
had
used
i
know
he
and
i
have
good
reason
for
knowing
i
tell
you
a
secret
you
are
the
very
first
persons
i
have
told
about
it
but
he
has
cured
me
i
have
been
sick
all
my
life
when
i
came
here
to
chautauqua
i
was
sick
i
could
not
do
anything
that
i
was
made
to
do
and
i
kept
doing
things
all
the
time
that
were
not
meant
for
me
to
do
but
he
has
cured
me
the
boys
looked
at
her
in
absolute
incredulous
wonder
was
you
sick
in
bed
when
you
came
ventured
one
of
them
at
last
no
it
is
not
that
kind
of
sickness
that
i
mean
that
is
when
the
body
is
sick
the
body
that
when
the
soul
goes
away
looks
like
nothing
but
marble
can
not
move
nor
feel
nor
speak
that
is
of
much
consequence
you
know
because
we
are
sure
that
the
soul
will
go
away
from
it
after
awhile
it
is
this
soul
of
mine
that
is
going
to
live
forever
that
was
cured
how
do
you
know
it
was
came
again
from
these
wondering
boys
flossy
smiled
a
rare
bright
smile
that
charmed
them
if
had
been
cured
you
would
not
ask
me
that
question
she
said
you
would
how
i
know
it
but
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
is
do
you
know
there
are
some
things
that
you
are
sure
of
that
you
explain
you
are
sure
you
can
think
are
you
but
how
would
you
set
to
work
to
explain
to
me
that
you
are
sure
the
only
way
that
you
can
know
how
is
by
going
to
this
doctor
and
getting
cured
then
you
will
understand
i
like
him
if
he
would
cure
folks
began
the
boy
who
had
a
sick
mother
speaking
in
a
doubtful
somewhat
dissatisfied
tone
he
does
flossy
said
quickly
do
people
bodies
get
well
sometimes
and
who
can
cure
bodies
except
the
one
who
made
them
if
you
want
your
mother
cured
you
ought
to
try
him
if
she
is
to
be
made
well
you
may
be
sure
that
he
can
do
it
but
why
should
he
so
long
as
you
do
not
care
enough
about
it
to
ask
him
there
was
a
rush
and
a
bustle
among
the
crowds
in
the
distance
session
was
over
and
the
great
company
were
moving
for
seats
for
the
morning
service
the
boys
took
the
alarm
and
fled
each
glancing
back
to
nod
and
smile
at
the
bright
apparition
who
had
told
them
a
story
flossy
picked
up
her
bible
she
had
not
needed
to
use
it
during
this
talk
the
story
of
bethesda
had
burned
itself
so
into
her
heart
with
that
morning
reading
that
she
had
no
need
to
look
at
it
again
she
gave
a
thoughtful
little
sigh
i
do
know
about
that
being
teaching
she
said
within
her
heart
but
i
certainly
told
them
about
jesus
and
i
told
them
it
was
jesus
who
had
me
whole
i
made
my
own
experience
for
me
to
that
degree
if
that
is
what
they
mean
by
teaching
i
like
to
do
it
i
mean
to
go
to
just
as
soon
as
i
get
home
and
if
i
find
out
that
they
just
tell
about
things
as
they
are
in
the
bible
i
can
do
it
i
can
make
the
boys
listen
to
me
i
know
bright
little
fairy
that
she
was
there
was
a
new
glow
about
her
face
she
was
waking
to
the
thought
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
power
over
people
brains
no
danger
but
she
will
use
her
knowledge
let
me
tell
you
another
thing
that
chautauqua
did
for
her
it
planted
the
seed
that
shall
blossom
into
splendid
teaching
there
was
one
teacher
who
gave
many
glances
that
morning
to
the
little
group
around
that
old
tree
stump
roberts
from
his
point
of
observation
not
far
away
watched
this
scene
from
beginning
to
end
it
fascinated
him
he
saw
the
timid
beginning
and
the
interest
until
when
flossy
closed
her
bible
and
arose
he
turned
his
eyes
from
her
with
a
quiet
smile
in
them
and
to
himself
he
said
unless
i
am
very
greatly
mistaken
she
has
found
something
that
she
can
do
chapter
xx
people
who
having
eyes
see
not
girls
said
eurie
as
she
munched
a
doughnut
which
she
had
brought
from
the
with
her
and
lounged
on
a
waiting
for
the
afternoon
service
do
you
know
that
flossy
taught
a
class
in
this
morning
taught
a
class
repeated
both
marion
and
ruth
in
one
voice
and
with
about
equal
degrees
of
amazement
she
did
as
true
as
the
world
that
is
she
must
have
been
teaching
the
way
of
it
was
this
i
went
to
see
the
little
midgets
exhibit
themselves
and
when
i
came
out
of
the
tent
and
walked
over
toward
the
stand
there
sat
flossy
on
that
old
stump
just
back
of
the
stand
and
before
her
were
two
of
the
boys
that
ever
emerged
from
the
backwoods
they
were
ragged
and
dirty
and
wild
and
as
wicked
little
imps
as
one
could
find
i
am
sure
flossy
was
talking
to
them
and
she
had
a
large
bible
in
her
lap
and
one
of
those
lesson
leaves
that
they
flutter
about
here
so
much
and
well
altogether
it
was
an
amazing
sight
she
was
certainly
talking
to
them
with
all
her
might
and
they
were
listening
and
it
is
my
opinion
that
she
was
trying
to
play
teacher
and
give
them
a
lesson
you
know
she
is
an
imitative
little
sheep
and
always
was
nonsense
ruth
said
and
she
seemed
to
speak
more
sharply
than
the
occasion
warranted
just
as
if
flossy
shipley
could
have
anything
to
say
to
two
boys
but
what
she
found
in
the
bible
little
she
knows
what
is
in
it
for
that
matter
i
suppose
she
wandered
out
that
way
because
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
herself
and
talked
to
the
boys
by
way
of
amusement
she
has
often
amused
herself
in
that
way
i
am
sure
ah
yes
but
these
specimens
were
rather
too
youthful
and
dirty
for
that
sort
of
amusement
and
she
had
a
bible
in
her
lap
what
of
that
bibles
are
as
common
as
leaves
here
i
found
two
lying
on
the
seat
which
i
took
this
morning
people
seem
to
think
the
art
of
stealing
has
not
found
its
way
here
flossy
is
changed
interrupted
marion
the
mouse
is
certainly
different
from
what
ever
saw
her
before
she
seems
so
quiet
and
i
thought
she
was
bored
why
i
expected
her
to
hail
a
trip
to
her
dear
saratoga
with
absolute
delight
she
belongs
to
just
the
class
of
people
who
would
find
the
intellectual
element
here
too
strong
for
her
and
would
have
to
flutter
off
in
that
direction
in
ruthie
you
have
the
temper
of
an
angel
not
to
fly
out
at
me
for
bringing
in
saratoga
every
few
minutes
it
is
with
aforethought
i
assure
you
i
forget
your
projected
scheme
whenever
i
speak
of
it
but
you
must
allow
me
to
be
astonished
over
refusal
to
go
with
you
something
has
come
over
the
mousie
that
is
not
explainable
by
any
of
the
laws
of
science
with
which
i
am
acquainted
do
trouble
yourself
to
apologize
i
beg
i
hope
you
do
not
think
i
am
so
foolish
as
to
care
anything
about
your
hints
as
to
saratoga
of
course
i
recognize
my
right
in
this
world
to
be
governed
by
my
own
tastes
and
inclinations
i
have
enjoyed
that
privilege
too
long
to
be
disturbed
by
trifles
this
from
ruth
but
i
shall
have
to
admit
that
it
was
very
stiffly
spoken
and
if
she
had
but
known
it
indicated
that
she
care
a
great
deal
in
truth
she
was
very
sore
over
her
position
and
her
plans
she
who
had
prided
herself
on
her
intellectuality
bored
to
the
very
point
of
leaving
and
flossy
who
had
been
remarkable
for
nothing
but
flutter
and
fashion
actually
so
interested
that
she
could
not
be
coaxed
into
going
away
what
it
that
interested
her
that
was
the
question
which
interested
and
puzzled
ruth
she
studied
over
it
during
all
the
time
that
marion
and
eurie
were
chatting
about
the
morning
service
flossy
different
there
was
no
shutting
one
eyes
to
that
fact
the
truth
was
that
she
had
suddenly
seemed
to
have
little
in
common
with
her
own
party
she
certainly
said
little
to
them
she
made
no
complaints
as
to
inconveniences
even
when
they
amounted
to
positive
annoyances
with
the
rest
of
the
party
she
had
given
up
afternoon
toilets
altogether
and
in
fact
the
subject
of
dress
seemed
to
be
one
that
had
suddenly
sunken
into
such
insignificance
as
to
cease
to
claim
her
thoughts
at
all
grave
changes
these
to
be
found
in
flossy
shipley
then
too
she
had
taken
to
wandering
away
alone
in
the
twilight
during
the
short
spaces
between
services
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
but
the
chautauqua
bell
brought
her
back
invariably
in
time
to
make
ready
for
the
next
service
there
is
certainly
more
to
the
little
mouse
than
i
ever
expected
before
if
chautauqua
wakes
wits
as
it
has
flossy
we
shall
have
reason
to
bless
the
day
that
vincent
invented
it
this
ruth
heard
from
marion
as
she
roused
herself
from
her
reverie
to
give
attention
to
what
the
girls
were
saying
they
had
got
back
to
a
discussion
of
flossy
again
it
was
a
subject
that
someway
annoyed
ruth
so
she
dismissed
it
and
made
ready
for
the
afternoon
meeting
whither
they
all
went
to
marion
the
morning
sermon
had
been
an
intellectual
treat
she
had
a
way
of
listening
to
sermons
that
would
have
been
very
disheartening
to
the
preacher
if
he
had
known
of
it
she
had
learned
how
to
divest
herself
of
all
personality
the
subject
was
one
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
the
application
of
solemn
truths
were
for
the
people
around
her
who
believed
in
these
things
but
never
for
her
so
she
listened
and
enjoyed
just
as
she
enjoyed
a
book
or
a
picture
just
as
if
she
had
no
soul
at
all
nothing
but
an
intellect
it
was
very
rare
indeed
that
an
arrow
from
any
one
quiver
touched
her
but
there
was
one
single
sentence
in
pierce
sermon
that
was
destined
to
haunt
her
said
he
when
the
blind
man
was
questioned
he
could
argue
he
did
try
to
but
he
could
stand
up
there
before
them
and
say
i
was
blind
now
i
see
make
the
most
of
that
and
was
it
an
unanswerable
argument
there
is
no
argument
like
it
when
men
are
honest
and
earnest
and
spiritual
in
wall
street
it
tells
now
that
was
just
the
kind
of
sentence
to
delight
marion
heart
the
inconsistencies
of
christians
was
one
of
her
very
strong
points
she
saw
them
bristling
out
everywhere
and
she
looked
about
her
with
a
satisfied
smile
on
her
face
that
so
large
a
company
of
them
were
getting
so
sharp
a
thrust
as
this
and
suddenly
there
flashed
across
her
brain
an
utterly
new
thought
whereas
i
was
now
i
see
perhaps
she
said
to
herself
i
am
blind
what
if
that
should
be
the
only
reason
why
these
things
are
not
to
me
as
they
are
to
others
how
do
i
know
after
all
but
there
may
really
be
a
spiritual
blindness
and
that
it
may
be
holding
me
how
do
i
know
but
that
the
reason
some
of
these
poor
ignorant
people
whom
i
meet
are
so
firm
in
their
belief
of
christ
and
heaven
is
because
they
have
had
just
this
experience
i
blind
now
i
see
how
can
i
possibly
tell
but
that
this
may
be
the
case
i
wonder
what
i
think
anyway
do
i
really
think
that
all
these
men
gathered
here
are
either
deceived
or
deceivers
one
or
the
other
they
must
be
and
either
position
is
too
silly
to
sustain
or
else
i
must
be
blind
if
there
should
be
such
a
thing
as
seeing
and
i
discover
it
too
late
if
there
is
a
too
late
to
this
thing
and
i
do
not
find
it
out
simply
because
i
am
blind
what
then
the
sun
shines
of
course
though
i
dare
say
an
entirely
blind
man
does
believe
it
does
have
an
idea
anyway
what
it
is
how
can
he
over
and
over
did
she
revolve
this
sentence
and
look
at
it
from
every
attainable
standpoint
no
use
to
try
to
shut
it
off
back
it
came
all
the
clatter
with
which
she
had
amused
herself
during
the
interval
between
meetings
had
not
banished
it
no
sooner
was
she
seated
under
those
trees
waiting
for
the
afternoon
service
than
the
thought
presented
itself
for
her
to
consider
i
wonder
if
there
are
different
degrees
of
moral
blindness
she
said
suddenly
people
who
can
see
just
enough
to
enable
them
to
keep
constantly
going
the
wrong
way
so
that
they
are
no
better
off
than
the
blind
except
that
they
admit
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
seeing
the
thing
is
possible
i
suppose
ruth
turned
and
looked
at
her
wonderingly
what
you
talking
about
she
asked
at
last
i
moralizing
marion
said
laughing
you
yourself
suggested
that
train
of
thought
i
was
wondering
which
of
us
was
right
in
our
notions
you
or
i
and
for
all
practical
purposes
what
difference
it
made
you
are
too
high
up
for
me
to
follow
i
have
the
least
idea
what
you
mean
why
i
tell
you
i
was
contrasting
our
conditions
let
me
see
if
i
have
a
right
view
of
them
do
you
honestly
think
that
there
is
a
god
and
a
heaven
and
a
hell
and
that
to
escape
the
one
place
and
secure
the
other
certain
efforts
upon
your
part
are
necessary
why
of
course
i
think
so
i
have
never
made
any
pretense
of
disbelieving
all
these
things
i
think
it
is
foolish
to
do
so
exactly
now
for
one
question
more
have
you
made
the
effort
that
you
believe
to
be
necessary
have
you
been
hired
as
an
exhorter
ruth
said
trying
to
laugh
why
no
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
well
then
suppose
you
and
i
should
both
die
believe
any
of
these
things
you
do
but
you
do
practice
on
your
belief
then
according
to
your
own
view
you
will
be
lost
forever
and
according
to
that
same
view
so
shall
i
now
practically
what
difference
is
there
between
us
so
if
it
is
really
blindness
why
may
not
one
be
totally
blind
as
well
as
to
have
a
little
sight
that
keeps
one
all
the
time
in
the
wrong
way
i
dare
say
we
are
quite
as
well
off
ruth
said
composedly
only
i
think
there
is
this
point
of
difference
between
us
i
think
your
position
is
silly
i
do
see
how
any
one
who
has
studied
paley
and
butler
and
in
fact
any
of
the
sciences
can
think
so
foolish
a
thing
as
you
pretend
to
one
does
like
to
be
foolish
even
if
one
happen
to
be
a
christian
foolish
marion
repeated
and
there
was
a
fine
glow
on
her
face
do
you
go
and
talk
anything
so
wild
as
that
if
there
is
any
class
of
people
in
this
world
who
profess
to
be
simpletons
and
act
up
to
their
professions
it
is
you
people
who
believe
and
nothing
now
just
look
at
the
thing
for
a
minute
suppose
you
say
is
a
precipice
over
there
and
every
whiff
of
wind
blows
us
nearer
to
it
we
will
surely
go
over
if
we
sit
here
we
ought
to
go
up
on
that
hill
i
know
that
is
a
safe
place
and
yet
you
sit
perfectly
still
and
suppose
i
say
do
believe
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
precipice
and
i
believe
this
is
just
as
safe
a
place
as
there
is
anywhere
and
sit
still
now
i
should
like
to
know
which
of
us
was
acting
the
sillier
you
would
be
ruth
said
stoutly
if
you
persisted
in
disbelieving
what
could
be
proved
to
you
so
clearly
that
no
person
with
common
sense
would
think
of
denying
it
humph
said
marion
settling
back
in
that
case
i
think
there
would
be
very
little
chance
for
each
to
accuse
the
other
of
folly
only
i
confess
to
you
just
this
ruth
erskine
if
you
could
to
me
that
there
was
a
precipice
over
there
and
that
we
were
being
carried
toward
it
and
that
the
hill
was
safe
i
know
in
my
very
soul
that
i
should
get
up
and
go
to
that
hill
i
would
not
be
such
a
fool
as
to
delay
i
know
i
would
you
are
frank
ruth
said
and
her
face
was
flushed
i
am
sure
i
see
why
you
do
make
the
attempt
and
decide
for
yourself
if
you
feel
this
thing
so
deeply
think
there
ought
to
be
a
on
your
account
if
i
knew
vincent
i
would
try
to
have
this
thing
turned
into
a
regular
time
then
you
would
doubtless
get
all
the
help
you
need
marion
laughed
do
waste
your
sarcasm
on
me
she
said
cheerily
keep
your
weapons
for
more
impressible
subjects
you
know
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
any
such
arguments
i
have
been
talking
downright
truth
and
common
sense
and
you
know
it
and
are
hit
that
is
what
makes
you
sarcastic
did
you
know
that
was
at
the
bottom
of
most
sarcasm
my
dear
do
hush
please
these
people
before
us
are
trying
hard
to
hear
what
the
speaker
is
saying
this
was
ruth
answer
but
she
had
had
her
sermon
and
of
all
the
preachers
at
chautauqua
the
one
who
had
preached
to
was
marion
wilbur
the
infidel
it
was
her
use
of
pierce
arrow
that
had
thrust
ruth
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
thought
of
it
all
during
that
wonderful
afternoon
meeting
very
little
did
she
hear
of
the
speeches
save
now
and
then
a
sentence
more
vivid
than
the
rest
her
brain
was
busy
with
new
thoughts
it
all
so
very
queer
did
it
look
to
others
than
marion
a
strange
way
to
live
did
she
actually
believe
these
things
for
which
she
had
been
contending
if
she
did
was
she
in
very
deed
an
idiot
it
actually
began
to
look
as
though
she
might
be
she
was
not
wild
like
eurie
nor
intense
and
emotional
like
marion
she
was
still
and
cold
and
in
her
way
slow
given
to
weighing
thoughts
and
acting
calmly
from
decisions
rather
than
from
impulse
it
struck
her
oddly
enough
now
that
having
so
stoutly
defended
the
cardinal
doctrines
of
christian
faith
she
should
have
no
weapons
except
sarcasm
with
which
to
meet
a
bold
appeal
to
her
inconsistency
when
i
get
home
from
saratoga
she
said
at
last
turning
uneasily
in
her
seat
annoyed
at
the
persistency
of
her
thoughts
i
really
mean
to
look
into
this
thing
i
am
not
sure
but
a
sense
of
propriety
should
lead
one
to
make
a
profession
of
religion
it
is
as
marion
says
strange
to
believe
as
we
do
and
not
indicate
it
by
our
professions
i
am
not
sure
but
the
right
thing
for
me
to
do
would
be
to
unite
with
the
church
there
is
certainly
some
ground
for
the
thrusts
that
marion
has
been
giving
my
position
must
seem
inconsistent
to
her
i
certainly
believe
these
things
what
harm
in
my
saying
so
to
everybody
rather
is
it
not
the
right
thing
to
do
i
will
unite
with
the
church
from
a
sense
of
duty
not
because
my
feelings
happen
to
be
wrought
upon
by
some
strong
excitement
i
wonder
just
what
is
required
of
people
when
they
join
the
church
a
sense
of
their
own
dependence
on
christ
for
salvation
i
suppose
i
certainly
feel
that
i
am
not
an
unbeliever
in
any
sense
of
the
word
i
respect
christian
people
and
always
did
mother
used
to
be
a
i
suppose
she
would
be
now
if
she
were
not
an
invalid
most
of
the
married
ladies
in
our
set
are
i
do
see
why
it
is
quite
as
proper
for
young
ladies
to
be
i
certainly
mean
to
give
some
attention
to
this
matter
just
as
soon
as
the
season
is
over
at
saratoga
in
the
meantime
i
wonder
when
there
is
a
train
i
can
get
and
if
i
could
telegraph
to
mother
to
send
my
trunks
on
and
have
them
there
when
i
arrived
chapter
xxi
a
sense
of
duty
it
is
not
so
easy
to
get
away
from
ones
self
as
you
might
think
if
you
never
had
occasion
to
try
it
ruth
erskine
who
honestly
thought
herself
on
the
high
road
to
heaven
because
she
had
decided
to
offer
herself
for
as
soon
as
she
returned
from
saratoga
did
not
find
the
comfort
and
rest
of
heart
that
so
heroic
a
resolution
ought
to
have
brought
it
was
in
vain
that
she
endeavored
to
dismiss
the
subject
and
try
to
decide
just
what
new
costume
the
saratoga
trip
would
demand
if
she
could
only
have
gotten
away
from
the
crowd
of
people
and
out
of
that
meeting
back
to
the
quiet
of
her
tent
she
might
have
succeeded
in
arranging
her
wardrobe
to
her
satisfaction
but
she
was
completely
hedged
in
from
any
way
of
escape
and
the
inconsiderate
speakers
constantly
made
allusions
that
thrust
the
arrow
further
into
her
brain
i
am
not
sure
that
it
could
have
been
said
to
have
reached
her
heart
who
is
to
blame
that
you
can
not
all
be
addressed
as
for
christ
who
is
master
why
do
you
not
serve
him
these
were
sentences
that
struck
in
upon
her
just
as
she
was
deciding
to
have
a
new
summer
silk
trimmed
with
shirrings
of
the
same
material
a
shade
darker
she
did
not
know
whether
the
speaker
gave
a
peculiar
emphasis
to
that
word
or
whether
it
only
sounded
so
to
her
ears
did
this
resolution
that
she
had
made
put
her
among
the
what
was
she
ready
to
do
teach
in
the
involuntarily
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
did
not
like
children
tract
distributing
too
was
hateful
work
and
out
of
style
she
had
heard
some
one
say
what
wonderful
work
was
to
be
done
she
was
sure
did
know
sewing
certainly
was
in
her
line
she
could
make
clothes
for
the
poor
but
then
she
could
give
money
to
buy
them
with
oh
yes
she
was
perfectly
willing
to
do
that
and
then
she
tried
to
determine
whether
it
would
be
well
to
get
a
new
black
grenadine
or
whether
a
black
silk
would
suit
her
better
she
had
got
it
trimmed
with
four
rows
of
knife
pleating
headed
with
puffs
when
she
was
suddenly
returned
to
the
meeting
somebody
was
telling
a
story
she
had
not
been
giving
sufficient
attention
to
know
who
the
speaker
was
but
he
told
his
story
remarkably
well
it
must
have
been
about
a
miserable
little
street
boy
who
was
sick
and
another
miserable
street
boy
seemed
to
be
visiting
him
this
was
where
her
ears
took
it
up
it
was
up
a
ricketty
pair
of
stairs
and
another
and
another
to
a
filthy
garret
there
lay
the
sick
boy
burning
with
a
fever
mother
and
father
both
drunk
and
no
one
to
do
anything
or
care
anything
for
the
boy
who
was
fighting
with
death
said
his
visitor
bending
over
him
pretty
bad
ai
you
ben
do
you
ever
pray
says
ben
turning
fevered
eyes
on
the
questioner
do
know
what
that
is
you
know
there
was
a
man
once
named
jesus
christ
he
come
to
this
world
on
purpose
to
save
people
who
are
going
to
die
did
you
ever
be
told
about
him
who
is
he
he
is
god
you
have
to
believe
on
him
do
know
what
you
mean
ask
him
to
save
you
when
you
die
you
ask
him
to
take
you
and
save
you
i
heard
about
him
at
school
he
do
it
he
will
them
says
so
as
have
tried
him
silence
in
the
garret
ben
with
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
the
fever
growing
less
the
pulse
growing
fainter
suddenly
he
turns
back
asked
him
he
said
asked
him
and
he
said
he
would
ruth
looked
about
her
nervously
people
were
weeping
softly
all
around
her
marion
brushed
two
great
tears
from
her
glowing
cheeks
and
ruth
with
her
heart
beating
with
such
a
quickened
motion
that
it
made
her
faint
wondered
what
was
the
matter
with
every
one
and
wished
this
dreadful
meeting
was
over
or
that
she
had
gone
to
saratoga
on
saturday
it
was
hard
to
go
back
to
the
puffs
on
that
grenadine
dress
in
the
midst
of
all
this
but
with
a
resolute
struggle
she
threw
herself
back
into
an
argument
as
to
whether
she
would
stop
on
her
way
to
make
purchases
or
run
down
to
albany
as
soon
as
she
was
comfortably
settled
at
her
hotel
bliss
was
the
next
one
who
roused
her
you
have
never
heard
him
sing
then
i
am
sorry
for
you
how
can
i
tell
you
anything
about
it
you
should
hear
ruth
tell
it
how
his
voice
rolled
out
and
up
from
under
those
grand
old
trees
how
distinctly
every
word
fell
on
your
ear
as
distinctly
as
though
you
and
he
had
been
together
in
a
little
room
alone
and
he
had
song
it
for
you
this
loving
savior
stands
patiently
though
oft
rejected
calls
again
for
thee
calling
now
for
thee
prodigal
calling
now
for
thee
thou
hast
wandered
far
away
but
he
calling
now
for
thee
what
the
matter
with
everybody
was
this
an
army
of
prodigals
who
had
gathered
under
the
trees
this
sabbath
afternoon
turn
where
she
would
they
were
wiping
away
the
tears
she
felt
herself
as
if
she
could
hardly
keep
back
her
own
and
yet
why
should
she
weep
what
had
that
song
to
do
with
her
certainly
was
not
a
prodigal
she
had
never
wandered
for
she
had
never
professed
to
be
a
christian
what
strange
logic
that
because
i
have
never
owned
my
father
love
and
care
therefore
i
am
not
a
wanderer
from
him
ruth
did
not
understand
it
she
felt
almost
provoked
had
she
not
decided
this
very
afternoon
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
it
was
fitting
and
eminently
the
proper
thing
to
do
to
unite
with
the
church
and
had
she
not
determined
upon
doing
it
just
as
soon
as
the
season
was
over
what
more
could
she
do
why
could
she
not
now
have
a
little
peace
if
this
was
the
comfort
and
rest
that
the
christians
at
chautauqua
had
been
talking
about
for
a
week
she
was
sure
the
less
she
had
of
them
the
better
for
she
never
felt
so
uncomfortable
in
her
life
nevertheless
she
adhered
to
her
resolution
so
settled
was
she
that
it
was
the
next
proper
thing
to
do
that
she
staid
at
home
from
the
meeting
that
evening
to
write
a
letter
to
wayne
the
gentleman
who
you
will
perhaps
remember
accompanied
the
girls
to
the
depot
on
the
morning
of
their
departure
and
expressed
his
disgust
with
the
whole
plan
as
this
is
the
first
letter
miss
ruth
erskine
ever
wrote
you
shall
be
gratified
with
a
copy
of
it
dear
harold
i
am
alone
in
the
tent
this
evening
the
girls
have
all
gone
to
meeting
but
i
finding
it
exhaustive
not
to
say
tiresome
to
be
so
constantly
listening
to
sermons
have
staid
at
home
to
write
to
you
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
i
know
will
please
you
i
am
going
to
start
for
saratoga
morning
i
think
i
shall
take
the
train
now
do
you
make
up
your
mind
to
laugh
at
me
and
say
that
i
have
grown
tired
of
chautauqua
sooner
than
any
of
the
rest
it
is
true
enough
you
know
my
mode
of
life
and
my
enjoyments
are
necessarily
very
different
from
eurie
and
marion
those
two
naturally
look
upon
this
place
as
an
escape
from
drudgery
in
short
as
an
economical
place
in
which
to
enjoy
a
vacation
and
see
a
good
deal
of
society
for
there
are
a
great
many
people
here
there
is
no
denying
that
not
many
from
our
set
you
know
but
a
great
many
celebreties
in
the
literary
world
that
it
is
really
very
pleasant
to
see
i
am
not
sorry
that
i
came
if
for
nothing
else
i
am
glad
to
have
come
on
the
girls
account
they
would
hardly
have
ventured
without
me
and
it
is
a
real
treat
to
them
you
will
wonder
what
has
become
of
poor
little
flossy
and
want
to
know
whether
she
is
going
to
follow
me
to
saratoga
as
usual
but
the
little
sprite
refuses
to
go
i
fancy
marion
has
been
teasing
her
you
know
she
is
very
susceptible
to
ridicule
and
it
suits
marion
fancy
to
amuse
herself
at
the
expense
of
those
people
who
weary
of
chautauqua
she
has
attempted
something
of
the
kind
on
me
but
of
course
i
am
indifferent
to
any
such
shafts
having
been
in
the
habit
of
leading
rather
than
following
all
my
life
it
seems
natural
i
suppose
to
do
so
still
i
think
well
of
chautauqua
it
is
a
good
place
for
people
to
come
who
have
not
much
money
to
spend
and
who
like
to
be
in
a
pleasant
place
among
pleasant
people
and
who
enjoy
fine
music
and
fine
lectures
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
are
so
trammelled
by
work
and
small
means
at
home
that
they
can
not
cultivate
these
tastes
but
of
course
all
these
things
are
no
treat
to
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
you
that
i
am
bored
there
is
too
much
preaching
to
suit
my
fancy
not
real
preaching
either
for
we
have
had
what
you
could
call
a
sermon
until
but
which
constantly
bring
the
same
theme
before
you
now
you
are
not
to
conclude
from
this
that
i
do
not
believe
in
preaching
and
sunday
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
on
the
contrary
i
believe
more
fully
in
them
all
than
i
did
before
i
came
in
fact
i
have
this
very
afternoon
come
to
a
determination
which
may
surprise
you
and
which
is
partly
the
occasion
of
my
writing
this
letter
in
order
that
you
may
know
at
once
what
to
expect
harold
as
soon
as
the
season
is
over
and
i
get
back
home
i
am
going
to
unite
with
the
church
have
i
astonished
you
i
am
going
to
do
this
from
a
conviction
of
duty
you
need
not
imagine
that
i
have
been
wrought
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
excitement
that
i
do
know
what
i
am
about
i
assure
you
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
i
have
simply
concluded
that
it
is
an
eminently
proper
thing
to
do
so
long
as
i
believe
fully
in
the
church
and
in
religion
and
wish
to
sustain
both
by
my
money
and
my
influence
why
should
i
not
say
so
that
is
a
very
simple
and
altogether
proper
way
of
saying
it
and
saves
a
good
deal
of
troublesome
explanation
i
wonder
that
i
have
thought
of
it
before
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
that
it
was
some
remarks
of
marion
that
first
suggested
the
propriety
of
this
thing
to
me
you
know
she
is
an
infidel
and
i
am
not
and
she
intimated
what
is
true
enough
that
i
lived
exactly
as
though
i
thought
just
as
she
did
so
in
thinking
it
over
i
concluded
it
was
true
and
that
my
influence
ought
to
be
with
the
church
in
this
matter
now
you
know
harold
that
with
me
to
decide
is
to
do
so
this
is
as
good
as
done
i
should
like
it
very
well
if
you
choose
to
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
unite
at
the
same
time
that
i
do
i
am
sure
dennis
would
be
gratified
i
do
know
why
we
should
be
willing
to
have
it
known
where
we
stand
and
i
know
you
respect
the
church
and
trust
her
as
well
as
i
do
myself
i
told
marion
did
not
see
how
a
person
with
brains
could
be
an
infidel
or
something
to
that
effect
and
i
i
think
that
is
such
a
silly
view
to
take
of
life
just
as
if
everything
come
by
chance
and
if
god
did
not
make
everything
who
did
i
have
no
patience
with
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
am
glad
to
remember
that
you
have
no
such
tastes
by
the
way
are
the
arnotts
in
saratoga
i
hope
not
for
they
are
such
fanatics
there
is
no
comfort
in
meeting
them
and
yet
one
has
to
be
civil
seems
to
me
you
do
not
enjoy
the
opera
as
well
as
usual
nor
the
hops
either
what
is
the
matter
do
you
really
miss
me
if
there
is
any
such
foolish
fancy
in
your
heart
as
that
prepare
to
enjoy
yourself
next
week
for
i
shall
be
with
you
at
every
one
of
them
after
tuesday
it
will
take
me
until
then
to
get
something
decent
to
wear
i
hear
the
girls
coming
up
the
hill
and
i
must
leave
you
ruth
folding
and
addressing
this
epistle
with
a
satisfied
air
and
still
full
of
the
spirit
which
had
prompted
her
to
write
a
letter
ruth
finding
that
marion
had
come
in
alone
and
that
flossy
and
eurie
were
still
loitering
up
the
hill
gave
herself
the
satisfaction
of
communicating
her
change
of
views
i
have
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
what
you
said
this
afternoon
marion
and
there
is
truth
in
it
i
do
not
think
as
you
do
and
i
ought
to
take
some
measures
to
let
people
know
it
i
have
the
most
perfect
respect
for
and
confidence
in
religion
and
i
mean
to
prove
it
by
uniting
with
the
church
i
have
decided
to
attend
to
that
matter
as
soon
as
i
get
home
again
after
the
season
is
over
i
am
surprised
at
myself
for
not
doing
so
before
for
i
certainly
consider
it
eminently
proper
in
fact
a
duty
now
it
was
very
provoking
to
have
so
religious
a
sentence
as
this
received
in
the
manner
that
it
was
marion
tilted
her
stool
back
against
the
bed
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
luxury
of
a
ringing
laugh
really
ruth
said
you
have
returned
from
church
in
a
very
hilarious
mood
something
very
funny
must
have
happened
it
can
not
be
that
anything
in
my
sentence
had
to
do
with
your
amusement
yes
but
it
has
squealed
marion
holding
her
sides
and
laughing
still
oh
ruthie
ruthie
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
and
so
you
think
that
this
is
religion
you
honestly
suppose
that
standing
up
in
church
and
having
your
name
read
off
constitutes
christianity
do
do
it
ruthie
you
have
never
been
a
hypocrite
and
i
have
always
honored
you
because
you
were
not
if
this
is
all
the
religion
you
can
find
go
without
it
forever
and
ever
for
i
tell
you
there
is
not
a
single
bit
in
it
her
laughter
had
utterly
ceased
and
her
voice
was
solemn
in
its
intensity
i
do
know
what
you
mean
in
the
least
ruth
said
testily
you
are
talking
about
something
of
which
you
know
nothing
so
are
you
oh
ruthie
so
are
you
yes
i
know
something
about
it
i
know
that
you
have
reached
the
a
b
c
of
it
why
ruthie
do
you
remember
that
story
this
afternoon
do
you
remember
that
little
boy
in
the
garret
how
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
asked
god
to
save
him
have
you
done
that
do
you
honestly
think
that
ruth
erskine
have
anything
to
be
saved
from
do
you
know
the
little
fellow
said
has
he
answered
you
why
ruth
do
you
never
listen
to
the
church
covenant
how
does
it
read
it
is
eminently
fit
and
proper
for
those
who
believe
that
god
made
them
to
join
the
church
ruth
erskine
you
can
never
take
more
solemn
vows
upon
you
than
you
will
have
to
take
if
you
unite
with
the
church
and
i
beg
you
not
to
do
it
i
tell
you
it
means
more
than
that
i
had
a
father
who
was
a
member
of
the
church
and
he
prayed
oh
how
he
prayed
he
was
the
best
man
who
ever
lived
on
earth
every
one
knew
he
was
good
every
one
thought
he
was
a
saint
and
it
seems
to
me
as
though
i
could
never
love
any
god
who
did
not
give
him
a
happier
lot
than
he
had
as
a
reward
for
his
holy
life
but
do
you
think
he
thought
himself
good
i
tell
you
he
felt
that
no
one
could
be
more
weak
and
sinful
and
in
need
of
saving
than
he
was
oh
i
know
the
people
who
make
up
churches
have
more
than
this
in
them
think
it
is
all
a
deception
but
it
is
a
blessed
one
to
have
i
know
these
people
at
chautauqua
have
it
hundreds
of
them
i
see
the
same
look
in
their
faces
that
my
father
had
in
his
and
if
i
could
only
get
the
same
delusion
into
my
heart
i
would
hug
it
for
my
blessed
sake
but
do
you
ever
go
into
the
church
and
subscribe
to
these
things
that
they
will
ask
of
you
until
you
have
felt
the
same
need
of
help
and
the
same
sense
of
being
helped
that
they
have
if
you
do
and
there
is
a
god
i
would
rather
stand
my
chance
with
him
than
to
have
yours
and
marion
seized
her
hat
and
rushed
out
into
the
night
leaving
ruth
utterly
dumbfounded
chapter
xxii
one
minute
work
marion
struck
out
into
the
darkness
caring
little
which
way
she
went
she
had
rarely
been
so
wrought
upon
her
veins
seemed
to
glow
with
fire
what
difference
did
it
make
she
asked
herself
if
there
was
nothing
at
all
in
it
why
not
let
ruth
amuse
herself
by
joining
the
church
and
playing
at
religion
it
would
add
to
her
sense
of
dignity
and
who
would
be
hurt
by
it
there
was
a
difficulty
in
the
way
turn
where
she
would
it
confronted
marion
during
these
days
there
was
a
solemn
haunting
if
that
would
not
be
put
down
what
all
these
things
were
true
she
by
no
means
felt
so
assured
as
she
had
once
done
indeed
the
foundations
for
her
disbelief
seemed
to
have
been
shaken
from
under
her
during
the
last
week
remember
she
had
never
spent
a
week
with
christians
before
in
her
life
not
at
least
a
week
during
which
she
was
made
to
realize
all
the
time
that
they
were
christians
that
they
stood
on
a
different
platform
from
herself
now
as
she
tramped
about
through
the
darkening
woods
meeting
constantly
groups
of
people
on
their
way
home
from
the
meeting
hearing
from
them
snatches
of
what
had
been
said
and
sung
she
suddenly
paused
and
so
vivid
was
the
impression
that
for
long
afterward
she
could
not
think
of
it
without
feeling
that
a
voice
must
certainly
have
spoken
the
words
in
her
ear
yet
she
recognized
them
as
a
sentence
which
had
struck
her
from
pierce
sermon
in
the
morning
god
honors
his
gospel
even
though
preached
by
a
bad
man
honors
it
sometimes
to
the
saving
of
a
soul
but
think
of
a
meeting
between
the
two
the
sinner
saved
and
the
sinner
lost
who
was
the
means
of
the
other
salvation
it
had
thrilled
marion
at
the
time
with
her
old
questioning
thrill
what
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
now
it
came
again
she
stood
perfectly
still
all
the
blood
seeming
to
recede
from
and
leave
her
faint
with
the
strange
solemnity
of
the
thought
what
if
she
had
this
evening
been
preaching
the
gospel
to
ruth
what
if
the
words
of
hers
should
lead
ruth
to
think
and
to
hunt
and
to
find
this
light
that
those
who
were
not
blind
if
there
were
any
such
succeeded
in
finding
what
if
as
a
result
of
this
she
should
go
to
heaven
and
what
if
it
were
true
that
there
was
to
be
a
judgment
and
they
two
should
meet
and
then
and
there
she
should
realize
that
it
was
because
of
this
talk
that
ruth
stood
in
glory
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
gulf
of
separation
what
kind
of
a
feeling
would
that
be
oh
if
i
only
knew
she
said
aloud
sitting
suddenly
down
on
a
fallen
log
if
i
knew
that
any
of
these
things
were
so
or
if
i
could
only
get
to
imagining
that
they
were
i
would
take
them
up
and
have
the
comfort
out
of
them
that
some
of
these
people
seem
to
get
for
i
have
so
little
comfort
in
my
life
it
can
not
be
that
it
is
all
a
farce
such
as
ruth
horrid
resolve
would
lead
one
to
think
that
is
not
the
way
that
vincent
feels
about
it
it
is
not
the
way
that
pierce
preached
about
it
this
morning
it
is
not
the
way
that
man
bliss
sings
about
it
there
is
more
to
it
than
that
my
father
had
more
than
that
if
he
could
only
look
down
and
tell
me
whether
it
is
so
whether
he
is
safe
and
well
and
perfectly
happy
oh
it
seems
to
me
if
i
could
only
be
sure
beyond
a
doubt
that
god
did
give
an
eternal
heaven
to
my
father
i
could
love
him
forever
for
doing
that
even
though
there
is
a
hell
and
i
go
to
it
within
the
tent
they
were
having
talk
that
would
seem
to
amount
to
very
little
even
eurie
appeared
to
be
subdued
and
to
have
almost
nothing
to
say
ruth
was
roused
from
the
half
stupor
of
astonishment
into
which
marion
unexpected
words
had
thrown
her
by
hearing
flossy
say
oh
ruth
i
forgot
to
tell
you
something
smythe
stopped
at
the
door
on
saturday
evening
before
you
came
home
her
party
leave
for
saratoga
morning
and
she
wanted
to
know
whether
any
of
us
would
go
with
them
did
you
tell
her
i
was
going
ruth
asked
quickly
it
was
utterly
distasteful
to
her
to
think
of
having
smythe
company
she
did
not
stop
to
analyze
her
feelings
she
simply
shrank
from
contact
with
smythe
and
from
others
who
were
sure
to
be
of
her
stamp
no
flossy
said
i
did
not
know
what
you
had
decided
upon
i
said
it
was
possible
that
you
might
want
to
go
but
some
one
joined
us
just
then
and
the
conversation
changed
i
did
not
think
of
it
again
i
am
glad
you
did
ruth
said
emphatically
i
do
want
her
society
i
wo
go
in
the
morning
if
i
am
to
be
bored
with
that
party
i
would
rather
wait
a
week
they
are
going
in
the
morning
train
eurie
said
i
heard
that
tall
man
who
sometimes
leads
the
singing
say
so
he
said
there
was
quite
a
little
party
to
go
among
them
a
party
from
clyde
who
were
for
saratoga
that
is
them
you
know
nearly
all
of
them
are
from
clyde
yes
the
other
man
said
must
expect
that
of
course
there
is
a
froth
to
all
these
things
that
must
evaporate
toward
saratoga
or
some
other
resort
there
is
a
class
of
mind
that
chautauqua
is
too
much
for
think
of
that
ruthie
to
be
considered
nothing
but
froth
that
is
to
evaporate
nonsense
ruth
said
sharply
she
seemed
to
consider
that
an
unanswerable
argument
and
in
a
sense
it
is
nevertheless
eurie
words
had
their
effect
she
began
to
wish
that
letter
unwritten
and
to
wish
that
she
had
not
said
so
much
about
saratoga
and
to
wish
that
there
was
some
quiet
way
of
changing
her
plans
in
fact
an
utter
distaste
for
saratoga
seemed
suddenly
to
have
come
upon
her
conversation
palled
after
this
marion
came
in
and
the
four
made
ready
for
the
night
in
almost
absolute
silence
the
next
thing
that
occurred
was
sufficiently
startling
in
its
nature
to
arouse
them
all
it
was
one
of
those
sudden
careless
movements
that
this
life
of
ours
is
full
of
taking
only
a
moment
of
time
and
involving
consequences
that
reached
away
beyond
time
and
death
and
resurrection
eurie
ruth
had
said
where
is
your
head
ache
bottle
that
you
boast
so
much
of
i
believe
i
am
going
to
have
a
sick
headache
in
my
satchel
eurie
answered
sleepily
she
was
already
in
bed
there
is
a
spoon
on
that
box
in
the
corner
take
a
another
minute
of
silence
then
eurie
suddenly
raised
her
head
from
the
pillow
and
looked
about
her
wildly
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp
showed
ruth
slowly
pulling
the
pins
from
her
hair
did
you
take
it
she
asked
and
her
voice
was
full
of
eager
intense
fright
ruth
you
did
it
yes
i
did
of
course
what
is
the
matter
with
you
it
was
the
wrong
bottle
it
was
the
liniment
bottle
in
my
satchel
i
forgot
oh
ruth
ruth
what
will
we
do
it
is
a
deadly
poison
then
to
have
realized
the
scene
that
followed
you
should
have
been
there
to
sea
ruth
gave
one
loud
shriek
that
seemed
to
through
the
trees
and
eurie
moan
was
hardly
less
terrible
marion
sprang
out
of
bed
and
was
alert
and
alive
in
a
moment
ruth
lie
down
eurie
stop
groaning
and
act
what
was
it
tell
me
this
instant
oh
i
do
what
it
was
only
he
said
that
ten
drops
would
kill
a
person
and
she
took
a
i
know
where
the
doctor
cottage
is
said
flossy
dressing
rapidly
i
can
go
for
him
and
almost
as
soon
as
the
words
were
spoken
she
had
slipped
out
into
the
darkness
ruth
had
obeyed
the
imperative
command
of
marion
and
laid
herself
on
the
bed
she
was
deadly
pale
and
eurie
who
felt
eagerly
for
her
pulse
felt
in
vain
whether
it
was
gone
or
whether
her
excitement
was
too
great
to
find
it
she
did
not
know
meantime
marion
fumbled
in
trunk
and
came
toward
them
with
a
bottle
hold
the
light
eurie
this
is
flossy
i
happen
to
know
that
it
is
harmless
and
oil
is
an
antidote
for
half
the
poisons
in
the
world
ruth
swallow
this
and
keep
up
courage
we
will
save
you
down
went
the
horrid
spoonful
and
marion
was
eagerly
at
work
chafing
her
limbs
and
rubbing
her
hands
hurrying
eurie
meantime
who
had
started
for
the
hotel
in
search
of
help
and
hot
water
that
dreadful
fifteen
minutes
not
one
of
them
but
that
thought
it
was
hours
they
never
forgot
the
time
when
they
fought
so
courageously
and
yet
so
hopelessly
with
death
ruth
did
not
seem
to
grow
worse
but
she
looked
ghastly
enough
for
death
to
have
claimed
her
for
his
victim
and
flossy
did
not
return
eurie
came
back
to
report
a
fire
made
and
water
heating
and
seizing
a
pail
was
about
to
start
again
when
her
eye
caught
the
open
satchel
and
a
bottle
quietly
reposing
there
closely
corked
and
tied
over
the
top
with
a
bit
of
kid
she
gave
a
scream
as
loud
as
the
first
had
been
what
the
matter
now
marion
said
eurie
do
have
a
little
common
sense
she
did
take
it
burst
forth
eurie
it
is
all
a
mistake
it
the
right
bottle
here
is
the
other
corked
just
as
i
put
it
before
this
sentence
was
half
concluded
ruth
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
marion
utterly
overcome
by
this
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
was
crying
hysterically
there
is
no
use
in
trying
to
picture
the
rest
of
that
excitement
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
events
of
the
next
hour
are
not
likely
to
be
forgotten
by
those
who
were
connected
with
them
eurie
came
back
to
her
senses
first
and
met
and
explained
to
the
people
who
had
heard
the
alarm
and
were
eagerly
gathering
with
offers
of
help
there
was
much
talk
and
many
exclamations
of
thankfulness
and
much
laughter
and
at
last
everything
was
growing
quiet
again
i
can
not
find
the
doctor
flossy
had
reported
in
despair
he
has
gone
to
mayville
but
roberts
will
be
here
in
a
minute
with
a
remedy
and
he
is
going
right
over
to
mayville
for
the
doctor
do
let
him
i
beg
said
marion
who
was
herself
again
there
is
nothing
more
formidable
than
a
spoonful
of
your
i
do
know
but
the
poor
child
needs
an
emetic
to
get
rid
of
that
eurie
my
dear
ca
you
impress
it
on
those
dear
people
that
we
any
hot
water
i
hear
the
fourth
pail
coming
it
was
midnight
before
this
excited
group
settled
down
into
anything
like
quiet
but
the
strain
had
been
so
great
and
the
relief
so
complete
that
a
sleep
so
heavy
that
it
was
almost
a
stupor
at
last
held
the
tired
workers
now
what
of
it
all
why
did
this
foolish
mistake
of
bottles
which
might
have
been
a
tragedy
and
was
nothing
but
a
causeless
excitement
reach
so
far
with
its
results
let
me
tell
you
of
one
to
whom
sleep
did
not
come
that
was
the
one
who
but
half
an
hour
before
had
believed
herself
face
to
face
with
death
what
mattered
it
to
her
that
it
was
a
mistake
and
death
no
nearer
to
her
so
far
as
she
knew
than
to
the
rest
of
the
sleeping
world
death
was
not
annihilated
he
was
only
held
at
bay
she
knew
that
he
come
and
that
there
would
be
no
slipping
away
when
his
hand
actually
grasped
hers
she
believed
in
death
she
had
supposed
herself
being
drawn
into
his
remorseless
grasp
to
her
the
experience
so
far
as
it
had
led
her
was
just
as
real
as
though
there
had
been
no
mistake
and
the
result
had
been
all
her
proper
resolutions
so
fresh
in
her
mind
made
only
that
very
afternoon
had
been
of
no
more
help
to
her
than
so
much
foam
she
had
not
so
much
as
remembered
in
her
hour
of
terror
whether
there
a
church
to
join
but
that
there
was
a
god
and
a
judgment
and
a
savior
who
was
not
hers
had
been
as
real
and
vivid
as
she
thinks
it
ever
can
be
even
when
she
stands
on
the
very
brink
oh
that
long
night
of
agony
when
she
tossed
and
turned
and
sought
in
vain
for
an
hour
of
rest
she
was
afraid
to
sleep
how
like
death
this
sleeping
was
who
could
know
when
they
gave
themselves
up
to
the
grasp
of
this
power
that
he
was
not
the
very
death
angel
himself
in
disguise
and
would
give
them
no
earthly
awakening
forever
what
should
she
do
believe
in
religion
yes
she
knew
it
was
true
what
then
what
had
marion
said
was
that
all
true
aye
verily
it
was
she
knew
that
too
had
she
not
stood
side
by
side
with
death
the
hours
went
by
and
the
conflict
went
on
there
was
a
conflict
her
conscience
knew
much
more
than
her
tongue
had
given
it
credit
for
knowing
that
afternoon
oh
she
had
seen
christians
who
had
done
more
than
join
the
church
she
had
imagined
that
that
act
might
have
a
mysterious
and
gradual
change
on
her
tastes
and
feelings
so
that
some
time
in
her
life
when
she
was
old
and
the
seasons
for
her
were
over
she
might
feel
differently
about
a
good
many
things
but
that
hour
of
waiting
for
the
messenger
of
death
who
she
thought
had
called
her
had
swept
away
this
film
it
is
not
teaching
in
said
her
brain
it
is
not
tract
distributing
it
is
not
sewing
societies
for
the
poor
it
is
not
giving
or
going
it
is
of
these
things
or
of
them
or
of
them
as
the
case
may
be
and
as
they
come
afterward
but
it
is
this
question
am
i
my
own
mistress
do
i
belong
to
myself
or
to
god
will
i
do
as
i
please
or
as
he
pleases
will
i
submit
my
soul
to
him
and
ask
him
to
keep
it
and
to
show
me
what
to
do
or
when
and
where
to
step
the
night
was
utterly
spent
and
the
gray
dawn
of
the
early
sweet
summer
morning
was
breaking
into
the
grove
and
still
ruth
lay
with
eyes
and
thought
a
struggle
oh
dear
yes
such
an
one
as
she
had
never
imagined
that
strong
will
of
hers
which
had
led
not
only
herself
but
others
yield
it
submit
to
other
leadership
always
to
question
is
this
right
can
i
go
here
ought
i
to
say
that
what
a
thing
to
do
but
it
involved
that
she
knew
it
felt
it
she
might
have
been
blind
during
the
week
past
but
she
was
not
deaf
how
they
surged
over
her
the
sentences
from
one
and
another
to
whom
she
had
listened
they
were
not
at
play
these
great
men
what
did
it
mean
but
that
there
was
a
life
hidden
away
belonging
to
christ
she
felt
no
love
in
her
heart
no
longing
for
love
such
as
poor
little
flossy
had
yearned
for
she
felt
instead
that
she
was
equal
to
life
that
the
world
was
sufficient
for
her
that
she
wanted
the
world
but
that
the
world
was
at
conflict
with
god
and
that
she
belonged
to
god
and
that
she
give
herself
utterly
into
his
hands
moreover
she
knew
there
was
coming
a
time
when
the
world
and
saratoga
and
the
season
with
its
pleasures
would
not
do
there
was
grim
death
he
would
come
she
could
not
always
get
away
he
was
coming
every
hour
for
somebody
around
her
she
must
yes
she
get
ready
for
him
it
would
not
do
to
be
surprised
again
as
she
had
been
surprised
last
night
it
was
not
becoming
in
ruth
erskine
to
live
so
that
the
sound
of
death
could
palsy
her
limbs
and
blanch
her
cheek
and
make
her
shudder
with
fear
she
must
get
where
she
could
say
calmly
oh
are
here
well
i
am
ready
it
was
just
as
the
sun
which
was
rising
in
glory
forced
its
smiles
in
between
the
thick
leaves
of
the
chautauqua
birds
nests
and
set
all
the
little
birds
in
a
twitter
of
delight
that
ruth
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
said
aloud
and
with
the
force
that
comes
from
a
determined
will
that
has
decided
something
in
which
there
has
been
a
struggle
i
do
it
chapter
xxiii
i
been
redeemed
what
about
saratoga
was
eurie
first
query
as
she
awoke
to
life
and
talk
again
on
that
summer
morning
do
you
think
you
will
take
the
train
ruth
ruth
gave
nothing
more
decided
than
a
wan
smile
in
answer
and
in
her
heart
a
wonder
as
to
what
eurie
would
think
of
her
if
she
could
have
known
the
way
in
which
her
night
was
passed
she
is
more
likely
to
stay
in
bed
marion
said
looking
at
her
critically
you
will
never
think
of
trying
to
travel
will
you
ruth
dear
me
how
you
look
i
have
always
heard
that
hair
oil
was
weakening
but
i
did
not
know
its
effects
were
so
sudden
and
disastrous
and
then
every
one
of
these
silly
girls
laughed
the
disaster
of
the
night
before
had
reached
its
irresistibly
comic
side
to
them
only
ruth
shivered
visibly
it
was
not
funny
to
her
it
was
a
very
eventful
day
she
by
no
means
relished
the
character
of
invalid
that
the
girls
seemed
determined
ought
to
be
forced
upon
her
and
at
the
same
time
she
had
not
the
least
idea
of
going
to
saratoga
strangely
enough
that
desire
seemed
to
have
utterly
gone
from
her
she
had
not
slept
at
all
but
she
arose
and
dressed
herself
as
usual
with
only
one
feeling
strong
upon
her
and
that
was
a
determination
to
carry
out
the
decision
to
which
she
had
so
recently
come
and
she
had
not
the
least
idea
how
to
set
to
work
to
carry
it
out
she
went
with
the
rest
to
the
large
tent
to
hear
clark
address
to
primary
class
teachers
i
not
a
primary
class
teacher
and
not
likely
to
be
but
i
am
a
woman
and
gifted
with
the
natural
curiosity
of
that
sex
to
know
what
a
woman
may
have
to
say
in
so
big
a
place
as
this
i
do
see
how
she
dares
to
peep
this
was
eurie
explanation
of
her
desire
to
go
to
the
reception
ruth
went
because
to
go
to
meeting
seemed
to
be
the
wisest
way
that
she
knew
of
for
carrying
out
her
decision
and
a
good
time
she
had
she
had
not
imagined
that
teaching
primary
classes
was
such
an
art
and
involved
so
much
time
and
brain
as
it
did
she
listened
eagerly
to
all
clark
had
to
say
she
followed
her
through
the
blackboard
lessons
with
surprise
and
delight
and
she
awoke
at
the
close
of
the
hour
to
the
memory
that
although
she
had
been
interested
as
she
had
not
imagined
it
possible
for
her
to
be
on
such
a
theme
she
had
done
nothing
toward
her
determination
to
make
a
christian
of
herself
and
that
she
knew
no
more
how
to
go
to
work
than
before
when
i
find
out
how
to
be
one
i
know
i
will
go
to
work
in
the
i
have
changed
my
mind
on
that
point
this
she
told
herself
softly
as
they
went
back
to
dinner
it
was
a
strange
afternoon
to
her
she
became
unable
to
interest
herself
heartily
in
the
public
services
her
own
heart
claimed
her
thought
it
was
noticeable
also
that
for
the
first
time
chautauqua
chose
this
day
in
which
to
be
metaphysical
and
scientific
to
the
exclusion
of
personal
religion
not
that
they
were
irreligious
not
that
they
for
a
moment
forgot
their
position
as
a
great
religious
gathering
but
there
was
an
absence
of
that
intense
personal
element
in
the
talk
which
had
so
offended
ruth
taste
heretofore
and
she
missed
it
she
wandered
aimlessly
up
and
down
the
aisles
listening
to
sentences
now
and
then
and
sighing
a
little
they
were
eloquent
they
were
helpful
she
could
imagine
herself
as
being
in
a
state
to
enjoy
them
heartily
but
just
now
she
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
to
know
what
to
do
in
order
to
give
herself
a
right
to
membership
with
that
great
religious
world
why
should
chautauqua
suddenly
desert
her
now
when
she
so
much
needed
its
help
if
i
knew
a
single
one
of
these
christian
people
i
would
certainly
ask
them
what
to
do
this
she
said
talking
still
to
herself
she
had
come
quite
away
from
the
meeting
and
was
down
in
one
of
the
rustic
seats
by
the
lake
side
it
struck
her
as
very
strange
that
she
had
not
intimate
acquaintance
with
a
single
christian
she
even
traveled
home
and
tried
to
imagine
herself
in
conversation
on
this
subject
with
some
of
her
friends
to
whom
could
she
go
wayne
why
he
would
understand
her
in
the
least
what
a
strange
letter
that
was
which
she
wrote
him
could
it
be
possible
that
it
was
written
only
yesterday
how
strange
that
she
should
have
suggested
to
him
to
unite
with
the
church
how
strange
that
she
should
have
thought
of
it
herself
there
came
a
quick
step
behind
her
and
a
voice
said
miss
erskine
she
turned
and
tried
to
recall
the
name
that
belonged
to
the
face
of
the
young
man
before
her
you
do
not
remember
me
he
said
inquiringly
i
was
of
the
party
who
went
to
jamestown
on
the
excursion
oh
flint
she
said
smiling
and
holding
out
her
hand
i
beg
pardon
for
forgetting
that
seems
about
a
month
ago
so
it
does
to
me
we
live
fast
here
miss
erskine
i
have
been
looking
for
your
party
i
could
find
them
is
miss
shipley
in
your
tent
yes
i
thought
so
well
i
want
to
see
her
very
much
i
have
something
to
tell
her
that
i
know
will
give
her
pleasure
perhaps
you
would
take
a
message
for
me
i
want
her
to
know
that
since
last
week
when
she
told
me
of
her
friend
who
had
become
so
dear
to
her
i
have
found
the
truth
of
it
he
is
my
friend
now
and
i
want
to
thank
her
for
so
impressing
me
with
a
desire
to
know
him
that
i
could
not
give
it
up
ruth
looked
utterly
puzzled
something
in
the
young
man
reverent
tone
when
he
used
the
word
friend
suggested
that
he
could
mean
only
the
friend
for
whom
she
herself
was
in
looking
and
yet
flossy
shipley
what
had
to
do
with
him
do
you
mean
she
said
hesitatingly
and
yet
eagerly
for
if
he
indeed
meant
that
here
was
one
for
whom
she
had
been
looking
do
you
mean
that
you
have
become
a
christian
it
is
such
a
new
experience
he
said
his
face
flushing
that
i
have
hardly
dared
to
call
myself
by
that
name
but
if
to
be
a
christian
means
to
love
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
to
have
given
one
self
body
and
soul
to
his
service
why
then
i
am
assuredly
a
christian
this
was
it
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
she
had
spent
one
night
of
horror
she
could
not
endure
another
and
the
day
was
drawing
to
its
end
to
be
sure
she
felt
no
terror
now
but
the
night
might
bring
it
back
how
did
you
do
it
she
asked
simply
how
the
very
simplicity
of
the
question
puzzled
him
why
i
just
gave
myself
up
to
his
keeping
i
resolved
to
take
a
new
road
and
follow
only
where
he
led
miss
shipley
was
the
one
who
first
made
me
think
seriously
about
this
matter
and
then
i
went
to
the
service
that
evening
and
everything
that
was
said
and
sung
was
said
and
sung
right
at
me
i
was
just
forced
into
the
belief
that
i
had
been
a
fool
and
i
wanted
to
be
something
else
miss
shipley
ruth
said
brought
back
by
that
name
to
the
wonderment
you
are
mistaken
you
can
not
mean
flossy
she
is
a
christian
at
all
she
never
so
much
as
thinks
of
such
things
oh
are
mistaken
he
said
it
eagerly
and
positively
on
the
contrary
she
is
the
most
earnest
and
straightforward
little
christian
that
i
ever
met
in
my
life
why
i
never
had
anything
so
come
to
my
soul
as
that
little
sentence
that
she
said
about
having
found
a
i
know
it
is
the
same
one
i
have
seen
her
with
you
since
but
not
near
enough
to
address
her
name
is
flossy
i
heard
her
called
so
that
day
on
the
boat
flossy
ruth
said
it
again
in
a
bewildering
tone
and
rising
as
she
spoke
i
am
going
to
find
her
i
want
to
understand
this
mystery
i
will
give
her
your
message
flint
but
i
think
there
is
a
mistake
saying
which
she
bade
him
a
hasty
for
the
flutter
of
a
scarlet
shawl
had
reached
her
eyes
no
one
but
flossy
wore
such
a
wrap
as
that
she
wanted
to
see
her
at
once
and
she
want
charlie
flint
to
be
along
she
went
forward
with
rapid
steps
to
meet
her
and
slipping
an
arm
within
hers
they
turned
and
went
slowly
back
over
the
mossy
path
flossy
i
want
you
to
tell
me
something
i
have
heard
something
so
strange
i
think
it
is
not
so
but
you
can
tell
me
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
you
are
a
christian
i
wonder
if
flossy
has
any
idea
even
now
how
strangely
ruth
heart
beat
as
she
asked
that
simple
question
it
seemed
to
involve
a
great
deal
to
her
she
waited
for
the
answer
there
was
no
hesitation
and
no
indecision
about
flossy
answer
her
cheeks
took
a
pink
tint
but
her
voice
was
clear
i
i
am
ruth
i
do
not
even
have
to
speak
with
hesitancy
i
am
so
sure
that
christ
is
my
friend
and
i
grow
so
much
surer
of
it
every
day
that
i
can
not
doubt
it
any
more
than
i
can
doubt
that
i
am
walking
down
this
path
with
you
and
then
again
ruth
astonishment
was
in
part
lost
in
that
absorbing
question
how
did
you
get
to
be
one
it
is
a
simple
little
story
flossy
said
and
then
she
began
at
the
beginning
and
told
her
little
bit
of
experience
fresh
in
her
heart
dating
only
a
few
days
back
and
full
to
the
brim
with
peace
and
gladness
to
her
but
i
do
see
ruth
said
perplexed
i
do
find
out
what
to
i
want
to
be
told
how
to
do
it
and
none
of
you
tell
me
you
seem
to
have
just
resolved
about
it
and
not
anything
i
have
gone
so
far
myself
such
a
night
as
last
night
was
flossy
oh
you
can
never
imagine
it
and
then
she
told
her
story
as
much
of
it
as
be
told
of
the
horror
and
the
thick
darkness
that
had
enveloped
her
she
could
only
hint
what
an
eager
flash
there
was
in
flossy
bright
eyes
as
she
listened
when
you
said
that
she
began
eagerly
as
ruth
paused
when
you
said
will
do
it
what
then
did
you
feel
just
as
you
did
before
no
ruth
said
not
at
all
the
night
had
gone
by
that
time
as
i
looked
about
me
i
realized
that
it
was
daylight
and
i
fancied
that
my
feelings
were
the
result
of
a
highly
excited
state
of
nerves
but
the
resolve
was
not
to
be
accounted
for
in
any
such
way
i
meant
that
the
horror
though
of
which
i
had
been
telling
you
was
quite
gone
it
was
as
if
there
had
been
a
fearful
storm
with
the
constant
roll
of
thunder
and
suddenly
a
calm
i
had
the
least
feeling
of
fear
or
dread
and
i
have
had
all
day
but
i
may
have
the
very
same
experience
no
you
will
not
flossy
said
her
voice
aglow
with
feeling
and
with
joy
oh
ruthie
ruthie
there
no
night
you
have
got
beyond
it
i
tell
you
you
have
come
into
god
light
and
is
it
blessed
you
are
a
christian
now
but
protested
ruth
utterly
bewildered
i
do
not
understand
you
and
i
do
think
you
understand
yourself
in
what
way
am
i
different
from
what
i
was
yesterday
how
can
i
be
lost
in
god
sight
one
moment
and
accepted
the
next
easily
oh
easily
do
you
see
why
if
i
had
been
coaxing
you
for
a
year
to
give
me
something
and
you
had
steadily
refused
but
if
suddenly
you
had
said
to
me
i
will
i
have
changed
my
mind
i
will
give
it
to
you
would
there
be
a
difference
would
i
know
that
i
was
to
have
it
and
could
i
thank
you
then
and
tell
you
how
glad
i
was
just
the
same
as
though
i
had
it
in
my
hand
it
is
a
poor
little
illustration
ruthie
but
it
is
true
that
god
has
been
calling
you
all
your
life
and
if
you
have
all
the
time
been
saying
up
to
that
moment
when
you
said
solemnly
meaning
it
with
all
your
heart
will
i
tell
you
it
makes
a
difference
i
can
not
describe
to
you
how
strangely
all
this
sounded
to
ruthie
up
to
this
moment
she
had
not
realized
in
the
least
that
the
lord
was
asking
her
simply
for
a
decision
and
that
having
solemnly
given
it
the
work
so
far
as
was
concerned
was
done
and
the
new
relations
instantly
commenced
she
thought
it
over
that
sudden
calming
of
heart
that
sense
of
resolve
of
determination
so
strong
and
yet
so
quiet
she
remembered
what
a
strange
day
it
had
been
how
she
had
tried
to
keep
before
her
mind
the
horror
of
the
night
and
had
not
been
able
she
went
on
talking
with
flossy
telling
her
about
charlie
flint
noticing
the
happy
tears
that
glistened
in
flossy
eyes
as
she
received
her
message
taking
in
the
murmured
words
to
think
that
christ
would
honor
such
a
feeble
little
witnessing
as
that
and
realizing
even
then
that
it
would
be
very
blessed
to
have
one
say
to
her
you
have
been
the
means
of
leading
me
to
think
about
this
thing
why
should
care
though
whether
people
thought
about
this
thing
or
not
yesterday
she
did
during
all
the
talk
she
kept
up
this
little
undertone
of
thought
this
running
commentary
on
her
sudden
change
of
views
and
feelings
and
wondered
and
could
it
be
possible
that
she
was
utterly
changed
and
yet
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
was
she
did
she
love
christ
and
then
it
struck
her
as
the
strangest
thing
in
the
world
to
love
him
how
could
any
one
be
so
devoid
of
heart
as
that
why
a
mere
man
to
have
done
of
what
christ
had
done
for
her
would
have
received
undying
love
and
service
as
they
walked
they
neared
the
stand
and
there
came
just
at
that
moment
a
burst
of
music
one
of
those
strange
thrilling
tunes
such
as
none
but
the
african
race
ever
sing
the
words
were
familiar
and
yet
to
ruth
they
were
new
there
is
a
fountain
filled
with
blood
drawn
from
immanuel
veins
and
sinners
plunged
beneath
that
flood
lose
all
their
guilty
stains
a
sinner
was
ruth
erskine
a
sinner
yesterday
she
had
not
liked
it
to
be
called
a
prodigal
but
oh
yes
was
there
a
greater
sinner
to
be
found
than
she
how
long
she
had
known
this
story
how
long
she
had
known
and
believed
of
a
certainty
that
jesus
christ
lived
and
died
that
she
might
have
salvation
and
yet
she
had
never
in
her
life
thanked
him
for
it
nay
she
had
spurned
and
scorned
his
gift
so
much
worse
than
though
she
had
not
believed
it
at
all
for
then
at
least
she
could
not
have
been
said
to
have
met
him
with
the
insult
of
indifference
then
the
chorus
swelled
out
on
the
still
air
only
those
who
heard
it
under
the
trees
at
chautauqua
have
the
least
idea
how
it
sounded
only
those
who
hear
it
as
ruth
erskine
did
can
have
the
least
idea
how
it
sounded
to
her
i
been
redeemed
i
been
redeemed
over
and
over
the
strain
repeated
now
in
clear
soprano
tones
and
anon
rolled
out
from
the
grand
bass
voices
and
then
the
swelling
unison
i
been
redeemed
been
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
the
girls
had
stopped
and
almost
held
their
breaths
to
listen
they
stood
in
silence
while
verse
after
verse
with
its
triumphant
swell
of
chorus
rolled
out
to
them
the
great
tears
gathered
slowly
in
eyes
until
as
the
last
echo
died
away
she
turned
to
flossy
and
her
voice
was
clear
and
triumphant
i
believe
i
flossy
i
believe
i
have
it
is
a
glorious
thought
and
a
wonderful
one
it
almost
frightens
me
and
yet
it
thrills
me
with
perfect
delight
the
fountain
is
deep
enough
for
us
all
for
them
and
for
me
i
have
redeemed
and
if
god
will
help
me
i
will
never
forget
it
again
chapter
xxiv
sword
thrusts
by
the
next
morning
it
became
clear
to
our
girls
that
a
change
of
programme
was
a
necessity
ruth
had
by
no
means
recovered
from
her
shock
and
the
sleepless
night
that
followed
and
some
of
the
comforts
of
invalidism
must
be
found
for
her
at
the
same
time
she
utterly
repudiated
the
idea
of
saratoga
which
was
now
urged
upon
her
it
had
lost
its
charms
neither
would
she
go
home
i
have
decided
to
stay
until
the
last
meeting
she
said
with
quiet
determination
flossy
laughed
softly
she
knew
what
charms
chautauqua
had
taken
on
but
the
others
supposed
it
to
be
a
whim
resulting
from
the
ridicule
she
had
suffered
because
of
the
saratoga
scheme
after
many
plans
were
discussed
it
was
finally
decided
that
flossy
and
ruth
should
seek
quarters
at
the
hotel
in
mayville
ruth
coming
over
to
the
meetings
only
when
her
strength
and
her
fancy
dictated
and
having
some
of
the
luxuries
of
home
about
her
it
seemed
to
fall
naturally
to
flossy
lot
to
accompany
her
indeed
a
barrier
was
in
the
way
of
either
of
the
others
being
chosen
the
hotel
arrangement
when
one
took
into
consideration
the
numerous
to
and
from
the
ground
was
by
no
means
an
economical
proceeding
and
as
flossy
and
ruth
were
the
only
ones
who
were
entirely
indifferent
to
the
demands
of
their
purses
it
must
of
necessity
be
them
neither
of
them
was
disposed
to
demur
there
had
never
been
much
congeniality
between
these
two
but
they
had
been
friendly
and
now
there
was
a
subtle
bond
of
sympathy
which
made
them
long
to
be
together
so
during
the
next
morning
hours
those
two
were
engaged
in
packing
their
effects
and
preparing
for
a
flitting
to
the
mayville
house
meantime
marion
and
eurie
having
stood
around
and
looked
on
until
they
were
tired
departed
in
search
of
something
to
interest
them
it
is
too
early
for
meeting
marion
said
there
is
nothing
of
interest
until
i
sorry
we
missed
clark
i
like
to
look
at
her
and
listen
to
her
she
is
just
bubbling
over
with
enthusiasm
one
can
see
that
she
thinks
she
means
it
if
i
were
a
teacher
i
should
be
glad
i
was
here
to
hear
her
i
think
it
has
been
about
the
most
helpful
thing
i
have
heard
thus
far
helpful
to
those
who
indulge
in
that
sort
of
work
i
mean
i
wonder
what
those
normal
classes
are
like
eurie
said
studying
her
programme
we
have
been
to
one
of
those
have
we
what
do
you
suppose
they
do
marion
shrugged
her
shoulders
they
are
like
work
she
said
hours
they
are
named
and
i
suppose
some
hard
thinking
is
done
if
i
did
have
to
teach
school
six
hours
out
of
every
day
at
home
i
might
be
tempted
to
go
in
and
listen
to
them
but
i
came
here
to
play
you
see
and
to
make
money
they
are
not
good
to
report
about
people
who
stay
at
home
and
read
the
reported
letters
do
want
to
hear
anything
about
the
actual
they
want
to
know
who
the
speaker
was
and
how
he
looked
and
whether
his
gestures
were
graceful
and
if
it
is
a
lady
above
all
how
she
was
dressed
if
they
say
anything
remarkably
sarcastic
or
irresistibly
funny
you
may
venture
to
report
it
but
not
otherwise
consequently
reporting
is
easy
work
if
you
have
not
too
much
conscience
because
what
you
did
see
you
can
make
up
at
the
end
of
this
harangue
she
paused
suddenly
before
a
tent
whence
came
the
sound
of
a
firm
and
distinct
voice
what
is
this
she
said
and
then
she
lifted
a
bit
of
the
canvas
and
peeped
in
i
going
in
here
after
all
she
said
withdrawing
her
head
and
explaining
this
is
a
normal
class
i
guess
that
man
from
philadelphia
what
is
his
name
tyler
yes
that
is
it
bennet
tyler
is
leading
i
like
him
i
like
his
voice
ever
so
much
he
makes
you
hear
whether
you
want
to
or
not
then
someway
you
get
a
kind
of
a
notion
that
he
not
only
believes
what
he
says
but
that
he
it
is
so
and
that
is
all
there
is
about
it
i
like
to
meet
such
people
now
and
then
because
they
are
so
rare
generally
people
act
as
though
you
could
coax
them
out
of
their
notions
in
about
twenty
minutes
if
you
tried
when
they
are
talking
about
religious
subjects
i
mean
obstinacy
is
not
so
rare
a
trait
where
other
matters
are
concerned
let
go
in
what
is
the
subject
this
morning
eurie
asked
following
her
guide
around
to
the
entrance
somewhat
reluctantly
she
was
in
no
mood
for
shutting
herself
inside
a
tent
and
being
obliged
to
listen
whether
she
wanted
to
or
not
but
marion
was
in
one
of
her
positive
moods
this
morning
and
must
either
be
followed
or
deserted
altogether
tyler
was
reading
from
a
slip
of
paper
as
they
entered
this
was
the
sentence
he
read
difficulties
in
interpretation
which
arise
from
certain
mental
peculiarities
of
the
student
some
minds
and
not
by
any
means
the
strongest
or
noblest
must
always
see
the
for
everything
marion
gave
eurie
a
sagacious
nod
of
the
head
do
you
see
she
said
now
by
the
peculiar
way
in
which
he
read
that
he
made
believe
it
was
he
meant
and
by
the
way
i
not
sure
but
he
is
correct
i
must
say
that
i
like
a
reason
for
things
but
what
right
has
he
to
say
that
is
an
indication
of
a
weak
mind
he
did
say
so
whispered
eurie
oh
yes
he
did
it
amounted
to
that
there
is
where
his
peculiar
use
of
words
comes
in
that
man
has
words
until
he
handles
them
as
if
they
were
and
were
to
go
exactly
where
he
sent
them
he
is
looking
this
way
the
next
thing
you
know
he
will
throw
some
at
us
for
whispering
this
was
ernie
attempt
to
quiet
marion
tongue
that
or
some
other
influence
had
the
desired
effect
she
whispered
no
more
and
it
was
apparent
in
a
very
few
minutes
that
she
had
become
intensely
interested
in
the
theme
and
in
the
way
it
was
being
handled
an
eager
examination
of
the
programme
disclosed
what
she
began
to
suspect
that
the
subject
was
difficulties
in
the
bible
her
intellectual
knowledge
of
the
bible
was
considerable
and
having
read
it
ever
since
she
could
remember
with
the
express
purpose
of
finding
difficulties
it
was
not
surprising
that
she
had
found
them
something
either
in
the
leader
manner
of
drawing
out
answers
or
the
peculiar
emphasis
with
which
he
contrived
to
invest
certain
words
had
the
effect
to
cause
marion
to
feel
as
though
she
had
been
very
superficial
in
her
reasoning
and
childish
in
her
objections
she
grew
eager
her
brain
accustomed
to
work
rapidly
and
follow
trains
of
thought
closely
enjoyed
the
keen
play
of
thought
that
was
being
drawn
forth
but
there
was
more
than
that
almost
unconsciously
to
herself
this
subject
was
assuming
vital
proportions
to
her
she
did
not
even
herself
realize
the
intensity
of
the
cry
in
her
heart
if
i
only
whether
these
were
so
presently
the
voice
which
had
once
before
struck
her
as
being
so
peculiar
in
its
personality
sounded
distinctly
down
the
long
tent
remember
the
conditions
under
which
the
bible
promise
clear
apprehension
of
the
truth
it
chanced
at
least
that
is
the
way
in
which
we
use
language
it
chanced
that
tyler
eyes
as
he
repeated
these
words
rested
on
marion
speaking
of
it
afterward
she
said
so
far
as
the
impression
made
on
me
was
concerned
it
was
the
same
as
though
he
had
said
you
understand
what
an
idiot
you
have
been
not
to
take
that
cardinal
point
into
consideration
at
all
open
your
bible
and
read
and
see
how
like
a
babe
you
are
beside
her
lay
a
bible
just
dropped
by
some
one
who
had
been
called
out
following
out
the
impulse
of
the
moment
she
turned
to
the
reference
and
her
clear
voice
gave
it
distinctly
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
whether
it
be
of
god
or
whether
i
speak
of
myself
the
effect
of
this
simple
straightforward
and
reasonable
proposition
on
sounding
back
to
her
spoken
by
her
own
voice
was
tremendous
very
little
more
of
the
talk
did
she
hear
a
thrust
from
god
own
sword
had
reached
her
what
a
fool
she
had
been
what
right
had
she
to
presume
to
give
an
opinion
before
applying
the
test
had
not
the
most
statements
a
right
to
be
tried
by
their
own
tests
yet
she
had
never
given
this
simple
direction
a
thought
so
this
was
the
bible
promise
he
know
not
that
these
things
are
so
but
a
more
logical
more
satisfactory
statement
to
the
natural
heart
he
shall
judge
for
himself
whether
these
things
be
so
follow
the
directions
and
then
judge
by
your
experiences
after
that
whether
these
things
be
true
or
false
could
anything
be
more
reasonable
i
shall
never
dare
to
say
that
i
do
believe
the
bible
again
for
fear
some
one
will
ask
me
whether
i
have
applied
the
test
and
if
i
have
not
what
business
have
i
to
judge
that
man
now
if
i
should
come
in
contact
with
him
which
i
shall
endeavor
not
to
do
would
be
sure
to
ask
me
he
has
almost
the
same
as
asked
it
now
before
all
these
people
he
has
a
mysterious
way
of
making
me
feel
as
though
he
was
talking
for
my
confusion
and
for
nobody
else
this
marion
told
to
herself
as
she
eyed
the
leader
half
sullenly
he
had
strangely
disturbed
her
logic
and
set
her
refuge
in
ruins
let
go
she
said
suddenly
to
eurie
i
am
tired
of
this
i
have
had
enough
and
more
than
enough
but
the
hour
was
over
and
she
had
had
all
that
was
to
be
secured
from
that
source
all
the
younger
portion
of
the
congregation
seemed
to
be
rushing
back
up
the
hill
again
and
inquiry
developed
the
fact
that
clark
was
to
meet
the
primary
workers
in
the
large
tent
it
was
wonderful
how
many
people
chose
to
consider
themselves
primary
workers
at
least
they
rushed
to
this
meeting
a
great
army
of
them
as
though
their
one
object
in
life
was
to
learn
how
successfully
to
teach
the
little
ones
our
girls
all
met
together
in
the
tent
ruth
and
flossy
had
finished
their
preparations
but
had
concluded
to
wait
until
afternoon
service
i
declare
if
are
not
armed
with
a
pencil
and
paper
have
you
been
seized
with
a
mania
for
taking
notes
this
eurie
said
to
ruth
now
going
to
get
out
note
book
too
here
is
a
card
it
will
hold
all
i
care
to
write
i
dare
say
let
me
see
who
knows
but
i
shall
go
to
teaching
in
one
of
these
days
i
am
going
to
make
a
list
of
the
things
which
according
to
clark
we
shall
need
true
to
her
new
fancy
she
scribbled
industriously
during
the
session
and
showed
her
card
with
glee
as
they
left
the
tent
i
a
complete
list
she
said
if
any
of
you
go
into
the
business
i
can
supply
you
with
the
names
of
the
necessary
tools
look
a
blackboard
a
picture
roll
a
punch
cards
brains
blank
book
children
more
brains
that
last
item
she
said
reflectively
is
the
hardest
to
find
i
had
no
idea
so
much
of
that
material
was
necessary
now
let
me
see
what
is
on
your
papers
this
even
marion
stoutly
resisted
and
flossy
quietly
hid
hers
in
her
pocket
saying
with
a
smile
mine
is
simply
a
list
of
things
needful
for
such
work
if
she
had
shown
her
paper
it
would
have
astonished
eurie
and
it
might
have
done
her
good
this
was
what
she
had
written
what
i
need
in
order
to
be
a
successful
teacher
such
a
forgetfulness
of
self
as
shall
lead
me
to
think
only
of
the
little
ones
and
their
needs
such
a
love
for
christ
as
shall
lead
me
to
long
after
every
little
soul
to
lead
it
to
him
as
for
marion
her
paper
contained
simply
this
sentence
carefully
written
out
in
german
text
as
if
she
had
deliberated
over
each
letter
if
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
whether
it
be
of
god
they
went
in
a
body
to
hear
hatfield
i
want
that
lecture
marion
said
of
the
hour
i
very
anxious
to
know
what
my
peril
is
i
know
just
what
is
hovering
over
every
one
of
you
but
i
ca
quite
make
up
my
mind
as
to
my
own
state
perhaps
the
distinguished
gentleman
can
help
me
and
he
did
he
had
selected
for
one
of
the
perils
that
which
was
embodied
in
the
following
ringing
sentence
the
third
peril
is
the
prevelancy
of
skepticism
a
class
of
scientists
have
discovered
that
there
is
no
god
what
the
fool
said
in
his
they
proclaimed
on
the
eurie
looked
over
at
her
smiling
and
mischievous
and
said
in
anything
but
a
softly
whisper
that
means
you
my
dear
but
marion
did
not
hear
her
she
was
absorbed
in
the
intense
scathing
sentences
that
followed
of
one
thing
she
presently
felt
assured
that
whoever
was
right
or
whoever
was
wrong
in
this
matter
hatfield
believed
with
all
the
intensity
of
an
intense
educated
intellect
that
god
ruled
was
it
probable
that
he
had
met
the
condition
done
his
will
and
so
of
the
doctrine
that
was
an
hour
to
be
remembered
eurie
ceased
to
whisper
or
to
frolic
there
was
too
much
intensity
about
the
speaker
manner
not
to
claim
her
attention
she
listened
as
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
listening
she
could
give
you
a
detailed
account
even
now
of
that
hour
of
thought
so
could
i
and
i
am
awfully
tempted
but
you
see
it
is
only
tuesday
and
the
girls
have
six
more
days
to
spend
at
chautauqua
both
ruth
and
flossy
got
their
crumb
to
think
over
they
discussed
it
at
the
hotel
that
evening
i
tell
you
flossy
if
hatfield
is
correct
you
and
i
have
tremendous
changes
to
make
in
our
way
of
spending
the
sabbath
and
i
have
actually
prided
myself
on
the
way
in
which
i
respected
the
day
and
ruth
laughed
as
if
that
were
so
strange
a
thought
now
that
it
was
hardly
possible
to
think
that
she
could
have
entertained
it
i
know
flossy
said
and
he
can
not
but
be
right
for
he
proved
his
position
i
am
glad
i
heard
that
address
but
for
him
i
know
i
should
never
have
thought
of
my
influence
in
some
places
where
i
now
see
i
can
use
it
ruth
you
will
be
struck
with
one
thing
now
chautauqua
is
like
what
madame
c
school
might
have
been
so
far
as
study
is
concerned
every
day
i
have
a
new
lesson
one
that
startles
me
so
i
feel
that
there
must
be
some
mistake
or
i
would
have
heard
of
or
thought
of
some
of
these
things
before
and
yet
they
sound
so
reasonable
when
you
come
to
think
them
over
that
presently
i
am
surprised
that
i
have
not
felt
them
before
ruthie
do
you
think
eurie
and
marion
have
any
interest
at
all
no
said
ruth
positively
i
know
marion
has
it
was
only
the
other
evening
that
she
talked
more
wildly
if
anything
than
before
about
this
time
marion
alone
in
her
tent
said
again
as
she
had
said
a
dozen
times
during
the
last
few
days
if
i
and
this
time
she
added
if
i
only
knew
to
know
chapter
xxv
sermons
in
chalk
now
see
here
marion
wilbur
wake
up
and
give
me
your
attention
i
want
to
make
a
speech
i
caught
the
infection
it
queer
in
a
place
where
there
is
so
much
done
that
i
ca
have
a
chance
to
express
my
views
i
all
attention
marion
answered
turning
on
her
pillow
and
giving
eurie
a
sleepy
stare
what
has
moved
you
to
be
eloquent
give
me
the
subject
the
subject
is
the
reflex
influence
of
preaching
it
may
have
different
effects
on
different
natures
its
effect
on
mine
has
been
marked
enough
i
thoroughly
surfeited
i
do
want
to
hear
another
sermon
while
i
am
here
and
i
do
to
they
are
all
sermons
the
subject
may
be
scientific
literary
or
artistic
and
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
they
contrive
to
row
around
to
the
same
spot
from
whatever
point
they
start
now
i
came
here
for
fun
and
i
being
literally
cheated
out
of
it
so
the
application
of
my
remark
is
i
learned
since
i
have
been
here
always
to
have
an
application
to
everything
and
this
time
it
is
that
i
wo
go
any
more
i
studied
the
programme
carefully
and
i
have
selected
just
what
i
am
going
to
do
that
knox
has
a
reception
this
morning
i
heard
about
her
before
she
is
awfully
in
earnest
and
awfully
good
oh
i
have
the
least
doubt
of
it
but
you
see
i
do
want
to
be
good
nor
to
have
such
an
uncomfortable
amount
of
goodness
about
me
she
is
said
to
be
one
of
the
most
successful
teachers
here
and
i
heard
a
gentleman
say
last
night
that
her
primary
class
was
a
regular
training
school
for
young
ladies
in
christian
work
you
know
she
has
ever
so
many
teachers
under
her
i
ca
help
that
i
am
not
one
of
them
i
am
thankful
to
say
what
do
i
care
whether
she
is
successful
or
not
that
wo
help
me
any
i
know
all
about
her
they
say
the
young
ladies
in
her
classes
are
invariably
converted
before
they
have
been
under
her
influence
long
so
if
you
want
to
be
converted
you
have
only
to
go
to
elmira
and
join
her
class
but
as
for
me
i
am
not
in
the
mood
for
that
experience
yet
and
i
am
not
going
near
her
what
you
going
to
do
then
just
what
i
please
that
is
what
i
came
for
just
think
of
the
absurdity
of
we
four
girls
rushing
to
meeting
at
the
rate
we
have
been
doing
for
the
last
week
what
do
you
suppose
the
people
at
home
would
think
of
us
why
i
did
expect
to
hear
any
of
their
sermons
when
i
came
i
as
good
as
promised
flossy
that
i
would
frolic
about
with
her
all
the
time
and
now
the
absurd
little
dunce
acts
as
if
she
were
under
a
wager
to
be
on
the
ground
every
time
the
bell
rings
i
declared
off
i
can
tell
you
to
an
item
just
what
i
am
going
to
hear
there
is
a
performance
to
come
off
this
afternoon
some
time
that
i
shall
be
ready
for
i
loitered
behind
the
king
tent
last
night
and
heard
him
say
so
that
frank
beard
is
going
to
give
his
chalk
talk
caricatures
that
i
shall
hear
and
especially
it
will
be
hard
work
to
poke
a
sermon
into
that
i
guess
that
is
to
be
this
afternoon
it
is
to
be
some
time
soon
anyway
and
i
shall
watch
for
it
then
there
is
to
be
another
extra
miller
is
going
to
read
a
story
i
can
give
you
the
title
of
it
i
did
sit
on
that
horrid
stump
in
the
dark
listening
to
vincent
for
nothing
it
is
to
be
blind
mice
now
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
story
with
such
a
title
will
not
be
very
far
above
my
intellectual
capacity
and
it
very
well
develop
into
a
sermon
or
close
with
a
then
i
going
to
the
concert
by
the
tennesseeans
their
jargon
wo
hurt
me
and
of
course
i
shall
attend
the
president
reception
i
must
have
a
stare
at
him
and
that
is
every
solitary
meeting
i
am
going
to
attend
i
heard
the
last
preaching
that
i
mean
to
for
some
time
now
this
was
what
eurie
mitchell
let
me
tell
you
a
little
bit
about
what
she
she
was
by
no
means
so
indifferent
nor
so
bored
as
she
would
have
marion
understand
she
was
by
no
means
in
the
state
of
mind
that
ruth
had
been
or
that
marion
was
no
doubts
as
to
the
general
truth
of
all
the
vital
doctrines
of
christianity
had
ever
troubled
her
she
accepted
without
question
the
belief
of
the
christian
world
neither
was
she
bewildered
as
to
what
constituted
christian
life
no
vague
notion
that
to
unite
herself
with
some
church
would
let
her
into
the
charmed
circle
had
ever
befogged
her
brain
on
the
contrary
she
knew
better
than
many
a
christian
does
just
what
the
christian
profession
involved
and
just
how
narrow
a
path
ought
to
be
walked
by
those
professing
to
follow
christ
in
proportion
to
the
keenness
of
her
sarcasm
over
blundering
stumbling
christians
had
her
eyes
been
open
to
what
they
ought
to
be
there
was
just
this
the
matter
with
eurie
she
knew
so
well
what
religious
professions
involved
that
she
wanted
to
make
none
she
hated
the
thought
of
of
bridling
her
eager
tongue
of
going
only
where
her
enlightened
conscience
said
a
christian
should
go
of
looking
out
for
and
calling
after
others
to
go
with
her
she
wished
deliberately
to
ignore
it
all
not
forever
she
would
have
been
shocked
at
the
thought
some
time
she
meant
to
give
intense
heed
to
these
things
and
then
indeed
the
church
should
see
what
a
christian
be
but
not
now
there
were
a
hundred
things
laid
down
in
her
programme
for
the
coming
winter
that
she
knew
perfectly
well
were
not
the
things
to
do
or
say
provided
she
were
a
christian
and
she
deliberately
wished
to
avoid
the
fear
of
becoming
one
just
here
she
was
afraid
of
the
influence
of
chautauqua
how
was
it
possible
to
attend
these
meetings
to
listen
to
these
daily
hourly
addresses
teeming
either
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
same
thought
personal
consecration
without
feeling
herself
drawn
within
the
circle
she
would
be
drawn
this
was
her
deliberate
conclusion
therefore
her
determination
it
was
almost
well
for
her
that
she
could
not
realize
on
what
fearfully
dangerous
ground
she
was
treading
i
wonder
if
those
over
whom
the
lord
says
let
them
alone
are
ever
conscious
at
the
time
that
the
order
has
gone
forth
and
that
they
are
to
feel
their
consciences
pressing
home
this
matter
no
more
well
said
marion
after
turning
this
resolution
over
in
her
mind
for
a
few
minutes
i
dare
say
you
will
lose
a
good
many
things
worth
hearing
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
only
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
up
to
hear
knox
this
morning
i
to
go
for
i
promised
especially
to
report
her
for
the
teachers
at
home
and
it
is
stupid
to
go
alone
wo
preach
and
she
wo
bore
you
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
remember
items
so
much
against
her
will
eurie
was
coaxed
into
this
departure
from
her
programme
and
came
back
from
the
meeting
in
intense
disgust
talk
about
not
preaching
she
said
venting
her
annoyance
on
marion
while
she
energetically
brushed
her
hair
every
fold
of
her
dress
preached
a
sermon
she
makes
me
ache
all
over
she
is
so
powerfully
in
earnest
and
did
she
hint
what
angels
of
goodness
those
girls
of
hers
were
those
teachers
i
like
to
know
how
they
could
be
anything
else
but
good
with
such
an
example
at
hand
just
think
marion
of
having
the
brains
that
that
woman
has
and
the
energy
and
tact
and
the
skill
of
a
general
and
then
forcing
it
into
a
class
room
for
the
teaching
of
a
hundred
little
dots
that
have
just
tumbled
out
of
their
cradles
well
if
she
teaches
them
to
tumble
out
on
the
right
side
so
that
they
will
come
up
grand
men
and
women
what
then
is
that
an
ambition
worthy
of
her
stuff
and
nonsense
do
you
go
to
preaching
i
shall
go
and
drown
myself
in
the
lake
if
i
hear
any
more
of
it
and
then
one
worthless
person
will
be
out
of
the
way
but
do
you
dare
to
ask
me
to
go
and
hear
that
woman
again
i
wo
give
up
my
plans
in
life
for
hers
and
she
need
hint
it
to
me
and
marion
wilbur
i
am
not
going
to
listen
to
another
man
or
woman
who
has
the
least
chance
to
fire
words
right
at
me
now
mark
my
words
full
of
this
determination
she
carried
it
out
during
the
afternoon
until
the
hour
for
frank
beard
caricatures
then
secure
from
fear
of
a
sermon
she
came
gayly
down
and
considered
herself
fortunate
to
secure
a
seat
directly
in
front
of
the
stand
and
in
full
view
of
the
blackboard
if
you
have
never
seen
frank
beard
make
pictures
you
know
nothing
about
what
a
good
time
she
had
they
were
such
funny
pictures
just
a
few
strokes
of
the
magic
crayon
and
the
character
described
would
seem
to
start
into
life
before
you
and
you
would
feel
that
you
could
almost
know
what
thoughts
were
passing
in
the
heart
of
the
creature
made
of
chalk
eurie
looked
and
listened
and
laughed
the
old
deacon
who
thought
the
was
being
glorified
too
much
had
his
exact
counterpart
among
her
acquaintances
so
far
as
his
looks
were
concerned
the
three
troublesome
scholars
fairly
convulsed
her
by
their
appearance
there
was
the
little
scamp
of
a
boy
who
was
revealed
by
the
dozen
to
any
one
who
took
a
walk
down
town
toward
the
close
of
the
day
the
argumentative
old
man
with
his
nose
pointing
out
a
flaw
in
your
reasoning
or
on
the
keen
scent
for
a
mistake
and
the
pert
girl
whose
very
nose
as
it
slightly
turned
upward
showed
that
she
knew
more
than
all
the
logicians
and
theologians
in
the
world
this
entertainment
was
exactly
in
eurie
line
if
there
was
anything
in
the
world
that
she
was
an
adept
at
it
was
looking
up
weak
points
in
the
characters
of
other
people
and
when
the
silly
girl
with
but
two
ideas
one
of
them
bows
and
the
other
beaux
lived
and
breathed
before
her
on
the
blackboard
her
delight
reached
its
climax
she
is
the
very
picture
of
nettie
arnold
she
whispered
to
marion
when
i
go
home
i
mean
to
tell
her
that
her
photograph
was
displayed
at
chautauqua
she
is
just
vain
enough
to
believe
it
still
the
fun
went
on
just
a
few
bold
rapid
strokes
and
some
caricature
breathed
before
them
so
real
that
the
character
was
guessed
before
the
explanation
was
given
and
the
ground
rang
with
continued
and
overpowering
roars
of
laughter
into
the
midst
of
this
entertainment
came
vincent
his
face
aglow
with
the
exertion
of
hearty
laughter
every
feature
of
it
expressive
of
his
hearty
appreciation
of
this
hour
of
recreation
and
yet
every
feature
alive
and
alert
with
a
higher
and
more
enduring
feeling
frank
he
said
laying
a
friendly
hand
on
the
artist
arm
our
time
is
almost
up
give
us
the
symbol
of
the
teacher
work
there
was
an
instant
of
rapid
motion
a
few
skillful
lines
and
it
needed
no
word
of
explanation
to
recognize
the
great
family
bible
now
the
symbol
of
the
teacher
hope
and
on
one
page
of
the
open
bible
there
flashed
an
anchor
now
the
symbol
of
his
reward
and
lo
there
rose
up
before
them
the
solid
wall
built
brick
by
brick
vincent
voice
was
almost
husky
with
feeling
so
suddenly
had
the
play
of
his
emotions
changed
as
he
said
now
we
want
the
foundation
how
did
frank
beard
do
it
with
a
dull
colored
crayon
and
a
movements
of
his
skillful
arm
how
can
i
tell
except
that
god
has
given
to
the
arm
wondrous
skill
but
there
appeared
before
that
astonished
multitude
a
foundation
as
of
granite
and
there
rose
from
it
as
if
suddenly
hewed
out
before
them
a
solid
shaft
of
gray
imperishable
granite
one
more
dash
of
the
wondrous
crayon
and
the
shaft
was
done
a
solid
cross
sherwin
was
sitting
for
want
of
a
better
position
on
the
floor
of
the
stand
it
was
the
only
available
space
he
had
been
looking
and
enjoying
as
only
men
like
sherwin
can
and
now
as
he
watched
the
outgrowth
of
this
wonderful
cross
as
the
last
stroke
was
given
that
made
it
complete
and
a
sound
like
a
subdued
shout
of
joy
and
triumph
murmured
through
the
crowd
moved
as
by
a
sudden
mighty
impulse
that
he
could
not
control
his
splendid
voice
burst
forth
in
the
glorious
words
rock
of
ages
cleft
for
me
let
me
myself
in
thee
and
that
great
multitude
took
it
up
and
rolled
the
tribute
of
praise
down
those
resounding
aisles
until
people
bowed
themselves
and
some
of
them
wept
softly
in
the
very
excess
of
their
joy
and
thanksgiving
it
was
all
so
sudden
so
unexpected
yet
it
was
so
surely
the
to
the
chautauqua
heart
and
fitted
in
so
aptly
with
their
professions
and
intentions
they
could
play
for
a
few
minutes
none
could
do
it
with
better
hearts
or
more
utter
enjoyment
than
these
same
splendid
leaders
but
how
surely
their
hearts
turned
back
to
the
main
thought
the
main
work
the
main
hope
in
life
and
in
death
as
for
eurie
she
will
not
be
likely
to
forget
that
sermon
it
almost
overpowered
her
there
came
over
her
such
a
sudden
and
eager
longing
to
understand
the
depths
from
whence
such
feeling
sprung
to
rest
her
feet
on
the
same
foundation
that
for
the
moment
her
heart
gave
a
great
bound
and
said
it
is
worth
all
the
and
all
the
change
of
life
and
plans
which
it
would
involve
i
almost
think
i
want
that
rather
than
anything
else
that
miserable
almost
i
wonder
how
many
souls
it
has
shipwrecked
the
old
story
if
eurie
had
been
familiar
with
her
bible
it
would
surely
have
reminded
her
of
the
foolish
listener
who
said
while
he
trembled
under
the
truth
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
shall
i
tell
you
what
came
in
just
then
and
there
to
influence
her
decision
it
was
such
a
miserable
little
thing
nothing
more
than
the
remembrance
of
certain
private
parties
that
were
a
standing
institution
among
their
set
at
home
to
meet
fortnightly
in
each
other
parlors
for
a
social
dance
not
a
ball
oh
no
not
at
all
these
young
ladies
did
not
attend
unless
occasionally
a
charity
ball
when
a
very
select
party
was
made
up
simply
quiet
evenings
among
friends
where
the
special
amusement
was
dancing
dear
me
you
say
i
am
a
christian
and
i
do
see
anything
wrong
in
why
i
dance
at
private
parties
very
often
what
was
there
in
that
thought
that
needed
to
influence
her
oh
well
we
are
not
arguing
you
know
this
is
simply
a
record
of
matters
and
things
as
they
occurred
at
chautauqua
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
a
story
except
as
records
of
real
lives
of
course
make
stories
but
eurie
was
a
christian
you
see
and
however
foolish
it
may
have
been
in
her
she
had
picked
out
dancing
as
one
of
the
amusements
not
fitting
to
a
christian
profession
it
is
a
queer
fact
for
the
cause
of
which
i
do
not
pretend
to
account
but
if
you
are
curious
and
will
investigate
this
subject
you
will
find
that
four
fifths
of
the
people
in
this
world
who
are
not
christiana
have
tacitly
agreed
among
themselves
that
dancing
is
not
an
amusement
that
seems
entirely
suited
to
if
you
want
to
get
at
the
reason
for
this
strange
prejudice
question
some
of
them
meantime
the
fact
exists
that
eurie
felt
herself
utterly
unwilling
to
give
up
the
leadership
of
those
fortnightly
parties
and
that
the
trivial
question
actually
came
in
then
and
there
while
she
stood
looking
at
that
picture
of
the
cross
and
in
proportion
as
her
sudden
conviction
of
desire
lost
itself
in
this
whirl
of
intended
amusement
did
her
disgust
arise
at
the
thought
that
she
had
been
actually
betrayed
into
listening
to
another
sermon
chapter
xxvi
their
works
do
follow
them
marion
went
alone
to
the
services
the
next
morning
it
was
in
vain
that
she
assured
eurie
that
miss
morris
was
going
to
conduct
one
of
the
normal
classes
and
that
she
had
heard
her
spoken
of
as
unusually
sparkling
eurie
shook
her
head
go
and
hear
her
sparkle
then
by
all
means
i
wo
now
that
a
very
inelegant
word
to
use
but
it
is
expressive
and
when
use
it
you
may
know
that
i
mean
it
i
am
tired
of
the
whole
story
and
i
have
been
cheated
times
enough
look
at
yesterday
it
was
a
dozen
combined
no
i
do
get
caught
this
morning
but
the
subject
is
one
that
will
not
admit
of
sermonizing
and
this
morning
marion
pleaded
i
am
specially
interested
in
it
it
is
to
win
and
hold
attention
if
there
is
anything
earthly
that
a
ward
needs
to
know
it
is
those
two
items
i
expect
to
get
practical
help
you
need
expect
anything
this
crowd
have
nothing
to
do
with
matters
this
side
of
eternity
as
for
the
subject
not
admitting
of
sermonizing
look
at
the
subject
of
blackboard
caricatures
what
came
of
that
so
she
went
her
way
and
marion
who
had
seen
miss
morris
and
had
been
attracted
looked
her
up
with
earnest
work
in
view
she
had
an
ambition
to
be
a
power
in
her
why
should
not
this
subject
help
the
tent
was
quite
full
but
she
made
her
way
to
a
corner
and
secured
a
seat
miss
morris
was
apparently
engaged
in
introducing
herself
and
apologizing
for
her
subject
i
tried
to
beg
off
she
said
i
told
them
that
the
subject
and
i
had
nothing
in
common
that
i
was
a
primary
class
teacher
and
in
that
line
lay
my
work
but
there
is
no
sort
of
use
in
trying
to
change
vincent
mind
about
anything
so
i
had
to
submit
but
for
once
in
my
life
i
remind
myself
of
gough
i
once
overheard
him
in
conversation
with
a
committee
on
lectures
they
were
objecting
to
having
him
lecture
on
temperance
and
pressing
him
to
name
some
other
subject
what
subject
you
please
gentlemen
he
said
at
last
i
lecture
on
it
but
remember
what
i
will
be
on
temperance
so
they
have
given
me
this
subject
and
i
have
engaged
to
take
it
but
i
want
you
to
remember
that
what
i
will
be
on
primary
by
this
time
miss
morris
had
the
sympathy
of
her
audience
and
had
awakened
an
interest
to
see
how
she
would
follow
out
her
programme
and
from
first
to
last
she
held
their
attention
certain
thoughts
glowed
vividly
i
do
know
who
else
they
influenced
but
i
knew
they
roused
and
startled
marion
and
will
have
much
to
do
with
her
future
methods
of
teaching
remember
said
the
speaker
that
you
can
not
live
on
and
teach
cream
the
thought
embodied
in
that
brief
and
telling
sentence
was
as
old
as
time
and
marion
had
heard
it
as
long
ago
as
she
remembered
anything
but
it
never
flashed
before
her
until
that
moment
what
an
illustration
she
saw
herself
teaching
her
class
in
botany
to
analyze
the
flowers
to
classify
them
to
tell
every
minute
item
concerning
them
and
she
taught
them
nothing
to
say
concerning
the
creator
was
this
teaching
she
knew
so
many
ways
in
which
did
she
but
have
this
belief
concerning
heaven
and
christ
and
the
judgment
in
her
heart
she
could
impress
it
upon
her
scholars
she
had
aimed
to
be
the
very
of
teachers
was
she
she
came
back
from
her
reverie
or
rather
her
to
hear
miss
morris
say
why
one
move
of
your
hand
moves
all
creation
and
as
surely
does
one
thought
of
your
soul
grow
and
spread
and
roll
through
the
universe
why
you
ca
sit
in
your
room
alone
and
think
a
mean
thought
or
a
false
thought
or
an
unchristian
thought
without
its
influencing
not
only
all
people
around
you
not
only
all
people
in
all
the
universe
but
nations
yet
unborn
must
live
under
the
shadow
or
the
glory
that
the
thought
involves
bold
statements
these
but
marion
could
follow
her
intellectually
she
was
thoroughly
posted
had
she
not
herself
used
the
illustration
of
the
tiny
stream
that
simpered
through
the
home
meadow
and
went
on
and
on
and
on
until
it
helped
to
surge
the
beaches
of
the
ocean
but
here
was
a
principle
involved
that
reached
beyond
the
ocean
that
ignored
time
that
sought
after
eternity
was
she
following
the
stream
could
she
honestly
tell
that
it
might
not
lead
to
a
judgment
that
should
call
her
to
account
for
her
influence
over
her
scholars
marion
was
growing
she
wanted
at
least
to
do
no
harm
in
the
world
if
she
could
do
no
good
but
if
all
this
mountain
weight
of
evidence
at
chautauqua
proved
anything
it
proved
that
she
was
living
a
life
of
infidelity
for
the
influence
of
which
she
was
to
be
called
into
judgment
no
sort
of
use
to
comfort
herself
with
the
thought
that
she
talked
of
her
peculiar
views
to
no
one
it
began
to
be
evident
that
the
things
which
she
did
do
were
more
startling
than
the
things
which
she
did
on
the
whole
no
comfort
came
to
her
troubled
soul
through
this
morning
session
to
herself
she
seemed
precisely
where
she
was
when
she
went
into
that
tent
only
perhaps
a
trifle
more
impressed
with
the
solemnity
of
all
things
but
without
knowing
it
a
great
stride
had
been
taken
in
her
education
she
was
not
again
to
be
able
to
say
i
injure
no
one
with
my
belief
i
keep
it
to
myself
no
man
liveth
to
himself
the
verse
came
solemnly
to
her
as
she
went
out
as
though
other
than
human
voice
were
reminding
her
of
it
and
life
began
to
feel
like
an
overwhelming
responsibility
that
she
could
not
assume
when
one
begins
to
that
thought
in
all
its
force
the
next
step
is
to
find
one
who
will
assume
the
responsibility
for
us
she
met
ruth
on
her
way
up
the
hill
flossy
has
deserted
me
ruth
explained
as
they
met
eurie
carried
her
away
to
take
a
walk
are
you
going
to
hear
about
john
knox
i
am
interested
in
him
chiefly
because
of
the
voice
that
is
to
tell
of
him
i
like
dr
hurlburt
marion
only
reply
was
i
do
see
but
you
come
to
meeting
quite
as
regularly
now
that
you
are
at
the
hotel
as
you
did
when
on
the
grounds
then
they
went
to
secure
their
seats
i
am
not
to
attempt
to
tell
you
anything
about
the
john
knox
lecture
indeed
i
have
given
over
telling
more
about
the
chautauqua
addresses
it
is
of
no
sort
of
use
one
only
feels
like
bemoaning
a
failure
after
any
attempt
to
repeat
such
lectures
as
we
heard
there
besides
i
am
chiefly
interested
at
present
in
their
effect
on
our
girls
they
listened
these
two
and
enjoyed
as
people
with
brains
must
necessarily
have
done
but
there
was
more
than
that
to
it
there
were
consequences
that
will
surely
be
met
again
at
the
last
great
day
ruth
as
she
walked
thoughtfully
away
said
to
herself
that
is
the
way
the
truth
it
is
a
different
day
and
the
trials
and
experiences
are
different
but
must
be
the
same
it
is
not
the
day
for
christianity
nor
for
idling
i
will
be
an
earnest
christian
or
i
will
not
dishonor
the
name
and
disgrace
the
memory
of
such
men
as
knox
by
claiming
to
be
of
their
faith
while
marion
as
she
turned
her
flushed
cheeks
hastily
away
from
ruth
not
willing
to
show
one
who
knew
nothing
about
this
matter
save
that
it
was
expedient
to
join
a
church
had
gotten
one
foot
set
firmly
toward
the
rock
the
power
that
enabled
man
to
live
life
was
certainly
of
god
she
thought
it
be
true
god
must
be
in
communication
with
some
of
the
souls
that
have
lived
is
he
now
and
can
i
be
one
of
them
oh
i
wonder
if
there
are
a
favored
few
who
have
shone
out
as
grand
lights
in
the
world
and
have
gone
up
from
the
world
to
their
reward
and
i
wonder
if
there
is
no
such
thing
now
if
the
blundering
creatures
who
call
themselves
by
his
name
are
nothing
but
miserable
imitations
of
what
was
real
such
lives
as
that
one
can
understand
but
how
can
i
ever
believe
that
deacon
cole
life
is
molded
by
the
same
influence
or
indeed
that
mine
can
be
must
i
be
a
deacon
cole
christian
if
i
am
one
at
all
the
afternoon
clouded
over
and
a
mincing
little
rain
began
to
fall
marion
stood
in
the
tent
door
and
grumbled
over
it
i
wanted
to
hear
that
mr
hazard
she
said
i
rather
fancy
his
face
and
i
fancy
the
name
of
his
subject
i
had
a
curiosity
to
see
what
he
would
do
with
it
and
here
is
this
rain
to
hinder
ruth
and
flossy
had
come
over
for
the
day
and
were
waiting
in
the
tent
have
you
been
at
chautauqua
long
enough
to
catch
one
of
its
cardinal
rules
never
to
stay
at
home
for
rain
flossy
said
marion
looked
around
at
her
she
was
putting
on
her
rubbers
are
you
really
going
she
asked
the
question
in
great
surprise
why
flossy
it
is
going
to
rain
hard
what
of
it
said
flossy
lightly
i
have
waterproof
and
rubbers
and
umbrella
and
if
it
gets
to
be
too
wet
i
can
run
to
a
tent
if
you
were
at
home
you
would
think
of
going
to
church
why
flossy
shipley
i
never
knew
you
to
go
out
in
the
rain
i
thought
you
were
always
afraid
you
would
spoil
your
clothes
that
was
because
i
had
none
already
spoiled
to
wear
flossy
answered
cheerily
but
that
difficulty
is
obviated
i
have
spoiled
two
dresses
since
i
have
been
here
this
one
now
is
indifferent
to
the
rain
and
will
be
for
the
future
i
have
an
improvement
on
that
plan
though
i
mean
to
have
a
dress
as
soon
as
i
get
home
come
it
is
time
we
were
off
i
believe
i
am
a
dunce
marion
said
slowly
i
think
it
is
going
to
rain
hard
but
as
i
have
to
go
at
home
whether
it
rains
or
shines
i
suppose
i
can
do
it
here
but
if
this
were
a
congregation
of
respectable
city
christians
instead
of
a
set
of
lunatics
there
would
be
a
dozen
out
they
found
hundreds
out
however
indeed
it
proved
to
be
difficult
to
secure
seats
that
address
was
heard
under
difficulties
in
the
first
place
it
rain
not
an
hearty
shower
that
would
at
once
set
at
rest
the
attempt
to
hold
an
meeting
but
an
exasperating
little
drizzle
enlivened
occasionally
by
a
few
smart
drops
that
seemed
to
hint
business
there
was
a
constant
putting
up
of
umbrellas
and
putting
them
down
again
there
was
a
constant
fidgeting
about
and
getting
up
and
sitting
down
again
to
let
some
of
the
more
nervous
ones
who
had
resolved
upon
a
decided
rain
escape
to
safer
quarters
half
of
the
people
had
their
heads
twisted
around
to
get
a
peep
at
the
sky
to
see
what
the
clouds
really
mean
anyway
our
girls
had
one
of
the
uncomfortable
posts
arrived
late
they
had
to
take
what
they
could
get
and
it
was
some
distance
from
the
speaker
and
their
sight
and
sound
were
so
marred
by
the
constant
changes
and
the
whirl
of
umbrellas
that
marion
presently
lost
all
patience
and
gave
up
the
attempt
to
listen
she
would
have
deserted
altogether
but
for
the
look
of
eager
attention
on
flossy
face
despite
the
annoyances
was
evidently
hearing
and
enjoying
it
seemed
a
pity
to
disturb
her
and
suggest
a
return
to
the
tent
besides
marion
felt
half
ashamed
to
do
so
it
was
not
pleasant
to
give
tacit
acknowledgment
to
the
fact
that
poor
little
unintellectual
flossy
was
much
more
interested
than
herself
she
gave
herself
up
to
an
old
and
favorite
employment
of
hers
that
of
looking
at
faces
and
studying
them
when
a
sudden
hush
that
seemed
to
be
settling
over
the
hither
to
fidgety
audience
arrested
her
attention
the
speaker
voice
was
full
of
pathos
and
so
quiet
had
the
place
become
that
every
word
of
his
could
be
distinctly
heard
he
was
evidently
in
the
midst
of
a
story
the
first
of
which
she
had
not
heard
this
was
the
sentence
as
her
ears
took
it
up
do
cry
father
do
cry
i
shall
be
with
jesus
and
i
will
tell
him
that
you
did
all
you
could
to
bring
me
there
what
a
tribute
for
a
child
to
give
to
a
father
love
flossy
with
her
cheeks
glowing
and
her
eyes
shining
like
stars
quietly
wiped
away
the
tears
and
in
her
heart
the
resolve
grew
strong
to
live
so
that
some
one
dying
could
say
of
her
i
will
tell
jesus
that
you
did
all
you
could
to
bring
me
there
do
you
think
that
was
what
the
sentence
said
to
marion
quick
as
thought
her
life
flashed
back
to
that
old
dingy
house
to
that
man
with
his
patched
clothing
and
his
gray
hairs
straggling
over
on
the
coarse
pillow
father
dying
her
one
friend
who
had
been
her
memory
of
love
and
care
all
these
long
years
dying
and
these
were
the
last
words
his
lips
had
said
do
cry
little
girl
father
dear
little
girl
i
am
going
to
jesus
i
shall
be
there
in
a
little
while
i
shall
tell
him
that
i
tried
to
have
you
come
oh
blessed
father
how
hard
he
had
tried
in
his
feebleness
and
weakness
to
teach
her
the
way
how
sure
he
had
seemed
to
feel
that
she
would
follow
him
and
how
had
she
wandered
how
far
away
she
was
oh
blessed
spirit
of
god
to
seek
after
her
all
these
years
through
all
the
weak
and
foolish
mazes
of
doubt
and
indifference
and
declared
unbelief
still
coming
with
her
down
to
this
afternoon
at
chautauqua
and
there
renewing
to
her
her
father
parting
word
she
had
often
and
often
thought
of
these
words
of
her
father
in
a
sense
they
had
been
ever
present
with
her
just
why
they
should
come
at
this
time
bringing
such
a
sense
of
certainty
about
them
to
her
very
soul
that
all
this
was
truth
god
solemn
unchangeable
truth
and
force
this
conviction
upon
her
in
such
a
way
that
she
was
moved
to
say
whereas
i
blind
now
i
see
i
can
not
tell
why
mr
hazard
was
used
as
the
instrument
of
such
a
revelation
of
god
to
her
i
can
not
tell
perhaps
he
had
prayed
that
his
work
at
chautauqua
that
rainy
afternoon
might
in
some
way
be
blessed
to
the
help
of
some
struggling
soul
perhaps
this
was
the
answer
to
his
prayer
unheard
unseen
by
him
as
many
an
answer
to
our
pleading
is
and
yet
the
answer
as
surely
comes
who
can
tell
how
this
may
be
i
do
not
know
i
know
this
that
marion
heart
gave
a
great
sobbing
cry
as
it
said
oh
father
father
if
your
god
if
your
christ
will
help
me
i
will
i
will
to
come
it
was
her
way
of
repeating
the
old
cry
lord
i
believe
help
thou
mine
unbelief
and
i
do
know
that
it
is
written
blessed
are
the
dead
which
die
in
the
lord
from
henceforth
yea
saith
the
spirit
that
they
may
rest
from
their
labors
and
their
works
do
follow
them
it
was
fifteen
years
that
the
weary
father
had
been
resting
from
his
labors
and
here
were
his
works
following
him
i
have
heard
that
mr
hazard
said
as
he
folded
his
papers
and
came
down
from
the
stand
that
afternoon
it
was
useless
to
try
to
talk
in
such
a
rain
with
the
prospect
of
more
every
minute
the
people
could
not
listen
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
adjourned
nothing
was
accomplished
much
knew
about
it
or
will
know
until
the
day
when
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
shall
be
revealed
chapter
xxvii
unfinished
music
meantime
this
day
which
was
to
be
so
fraught
with
consequences
to
marion
was
on
eurie
hands
to
dispose
of
as
best
she
could
to
be
at
chautauqua
and
to
be
bent
on
having
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
any
of
the
chautauqua
life
was
in
itself
a
novel
position
the
more
so
as
she
felt
herself
quite
deserted
the
necessity
for
reporting
served
marion
as
an
excuse
for
attending
even
those
meetings
which
she
did
not
report
and
the
others
having
gone
to
mayville
to
live
this
foolish
sheep
who
was
within
the
fold
and
who
would
not
be
it
went
wandering
whither
she
would
in
search
of
amusement
after
marion
left
her
she
made
her
way
to
the
museum
and
a
pleasant
hour
she
spent
one
could
certainly
not
desire
a
more
attractive
spot
she
went
hither
and
thither
handling
and
admiring
the
books
the
pictures
the
maps
the
profusion
of
curiosities
and
at
the
end
of
the
hour
when
the
press
of
visitors
became
too
great
to
make
a
longer
stay
agreeable
she
departed
well
pleased
with
herself
that
she
had
had
the
wisdom
to
choose
such
a
pleasant
resort
instead
of
a
seat
in
some
crowded
tent
as
a
listener
coming
out
she
walked
down
the
hill
and
on
and
on
watching
the
crowds
of
people
who
were
gathering
and
wishing
she
had
a
programme
that
she
might
see
what
the
special
attraction
was
that
seemed
to
be
drawing
so
many
at
last
she
reached
the
wharf
the
assembly
steamer
was
lying
at
her
dock
her
jaunty
flags
flying
and
the
commotion
upon
her
decks
betokening
that
she
was
making
ready
for
a
voyage
the
crowd
seemed
greater
there
than
at
any
other
point
it
would
appear
that
the
special
attraction
was
here
after
all
she
understood
it
and
pushed
nearer
as
the
ringing
notes
of
song
suddenly
rose
on
the
air
and
she
recognized
the
voices
of
the
tennesseeans
this
was
a
great
treat
she
delighted
in
hearing
them
she
allowed
herself
to
be
elbowed
and
jostled
by
the
throng
reaching
every
moment
by
judicious
pushing
a
place
where
she
could
not
only
hear
but
see
and
where
escape
was
impossible
the
jubilant
chorus
ceased
and
one
of
those
weird
minor
wails
such
as
their
music
abounds
in
floated
tenderly
around
her
it
was
a
farewell
song
so
full
of
genuine
pathos
and
so
tenderly
sung
that
it
was
in
vain
to
try
to
listen
without
a
swelling
of
the
throat
and
a
sense
of
sadness
something
in
the
way
that
the
people
pressed
nearer
to
listen
suggested
to
eurie
that
it
must
be
designed
as
a
farewell
tribute
to
somebody
and
presently
sherwin
mounted
a
seat
that
served
as
a
platform
and
gave
them
a
tender
informal
farewell
address
in
every
sentence
his
great
warm
heart
shone
i
am
going
away
he
said
before
the
blessed
season
at
chautauqua
is
concluded
i
am
going
with
a
sad
heart
for
i
feel
that
opportunities
here
for
work
for
the
master
have
been
great
and
some
of
them
i
have
lost
and
yet
there
is
light
in
the
sadness
for
the
work
that
i
can
not
do
will
yet
be
done
i
once
sat
before
my
organ
improvising
a
thought
that
was
in
my
heart
trying
to
give
expression
to
it
and
i
could
not
i
knew
what
i
wanted
and
i
knew
it
was
in
my
heart
but
how
to
give
it
expression
i
did
not
know
a
celebrated
organist
came
up
the
stairs
and
stood
beside
me
i
looked
around
to
him
you
take
this
tune
i
said
where
i
leave
it
and
finish
it
for
me
as
i
have
it
in
my
heart
to
do
i
ca
give
it
utterance
do
you
see
what
i
want
i
do
he
said
and
he
placed
his
fingers
over
my
fingers
on
the
same
keys
that
mine
were
touching
and
i
slipped
out
of
the
seat
and
back
into
the
shadow
and
he
slipped
into
my
place
and
then
the
music
rolled
forth
my
tune
only
i
could
not
play
it
he
was
doing
it
for
me
so
though
i
may
have
failed
in
my
work
that
i
have
tried
to
do
here
the
great
master
is
here
and
i
pray
and
i
hope
and
i
believe
that
he
will
put
his
grand
hand
upon
my
unfinished
work
and
in
heaven
i
shall
meet
it
completed
what
was
there
in
this
to
move
eurie
to
tears
she
did
not
know
sherwin
that
is
she
had
never
been
introduced
to
him
but
she
had
heard
him
sing
she
had
heard
him
pray
she
had
met
him
in
the
walk
and
asked
where
the
lesson
was
and
he
had
in
part
directed
her
directed
her
in
such
a
way
that
she
had
been
led
to
seek
further
and
in
doing
so
had
met
miss
ryder
and
in
meeting
her
had
been
interested
ever
since
in
studying
a
christian
life
was
this
one
of
sherwin
unfinished
tunes
would
he
meet
it
again
in
heaven
a
very
tender
spirit
took
possession
of
eurie
an
almost
irresistible
longing
to
know
more
of
this
influence
or
presence
or
whatever
name
it
should
be
called
that
so
moved
hearts
and
made
the
friends
of
a
week
say
farewell
with
tears
and
yet
with
hopeful
smiles
as
they
spoke
in
joy
and
assurance
of
a
future
meeting
sherwin
and
his
friends
embarked
and
the
dainty
little
steamer
turned
her
graceful
head
toward
mayville
and
slipped
away
over
the
silver
water
eurie
made
no
attempt
to
get
away
from
the
throng
who
pressed
to
the
edge
of
the
dock
to
get
the
last
bow
the
last
flutter
of
his
handkerchief
she
even
drew
out
her
own
handkerchief
and
fluttered
it
after
him
and
received
from
him
a
special
bow
and
was
almost
decided
to
resolve
to
be
present
in
joy
at
that
other
meeting
and
to
make
sure
this
very
day
of
her
title
to
an
inheritance
there
almost
going
back
she
met
ruth
and
flossy
she
seized
eagerly
upon
the
latter
come
she
said
you
have
been
to
meetings
enough
and
you
taken
a
single
walk
with
me
since
we
have
been
here
and
think
of
the
promises
we
made
to
entertain
each
other
flossy
laughed
cheerfully
we
have
been
entertained
without
any
effort
on
our
part
she
said
nevertheless
she
suffered
herself
to
be
persuaded
to
go
for
a
walk
provided
eurie
would
go
to
palestine
what
nonsense
eurie
said
disdainfully
when
flossy
had
explained
to
her
that
she
had
a
consuming
desire
to
wander
along
the
banks
of
the
jordan
and
view
those
ancient
cities
historic
now
however
i
would
just
as
soon
walk
in
that
direction
as
any
other
there
was
one
other
person
who
it
transpired
would
as
soon
take
a
walk
as
do
anything
else
just
then
he
joined
the
girls
as
they
turned
toward
the
palestine
road
that
was
evan
roberts
are
you
going
to
visit
the
holy
land
this
morning
and
may
i
be
of
your
party
he
asked
yes
flossy
answered
whether
to
the
first
question
or
to
both
in
one
she
did
not
say
then
she
introduced
eurie
and
the
three
walked
on
together
discussing
the
morning
and
the
meetings
with
zest
here
we
are
on
stormy
banks
roberts
said
at
last
halting
beside
the
grassy
bank
i
suppose
there
was
never
a
more
perfect
geographical
representation
than
this
do
you
really
think
it
has
any
practical
value
eurie
asked
skeptically
roberts
looked
at
her
curiously
has
it
to
you
he
said
now
to
me
it
is
just
brimful
of
interest
and
value
that
is
as
much
value
as
geographical
knowledge
ever
is
i
take
two
views
of
it
if
i
never
have
an
actual
sight
of
the
sacred
land
by
studying
this
miniature
of
it
i
have
as
full
a
knowledge
as
it
is
possible
to
get
without
the
actual
view
and
if
i
at
some
future
day
am
permitted
to
travel
there
why
well
you
know
of
course
how
pleasant
it
is
to
be
thoroughly
posted
in
regard
to
the
places
of
interest
that
you
are
about
to
visit
every
european
traveler
understands
that
but
do
you
suppose
it
is
really
an
accurate
outline
eurie
said
again
quoting
opinions
that
she
had
read
until
she
fancied
they
were
her
own
again
roberts
favored
her
with
that
peculiar
look
from
under
heavy
eyebrows
a
look
half
satirical
half
amused
some
of
the
most
skilled
surveyors
and
traveled
scholars
have
so
reported
he
said
carelessly
and
when
you
add
to
that
the
fact
that
they
are
christian
men
who
have
no
special
reason
for
getting
up
a
wholesale
deception
for
us
and
are
supposed
to
be
tolerably
reliable
on
all
other
subjects
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
the
statement
on
the
whole
eurie
had
the
satisfaction
of
realizing
that
she
had
appeared
like
a
simpleton
flossy
meantime
was
wandering
delightedly
along
the
banks
stopping
here
and
there
to
read
the
words
on
the
little
white
tablets
that
marked
the
places
of
special
interest
do
you
see
she
said
turning
eagerly
that
these
are
bible
references
on
each
tablet
would
it
be
interesting
to
know
what
they
selected
as
the
scene
to
especially
mark
this
place
roberts
swung
a
from
his
arm
planted
it
firmly
in
the
ground
and
drew
a
bible
from
his
pocket
miss
mitchell
he
said
suppose
you
sit
down
here
in
this
road
leading
from
jerusalem
to
bethany
and
tell
us
what
is
going
on
just
now
in
bethany
while
miss
shipley
and
i
supply
you
with
chapter
and
verse
i
am
not
very
familiar
with
the
eurie
said
if
you
are
really
in
the
village
yourselves
you
might
possibly
inquire
of
the
inhabitants
before
i
could
find
the
account
but
she
took
the
chair
and
the
bible
look
at
matthew
xxi
eurie
flossy
said
stooping
over
the
tablet
and
eurie
read
he
left
them
and
went
out
of
the
city
into
bethany
and
he
lodged
there
that
was
jesus
was
it
then
he
went
this
way
this
very
road
eurie
where
you
are
sitting
it
was
certainly
very
fascinating
and
stopped
at
the
house
on
which
you
have
your
hand
perhaps
roberts
said
smiling
at
her
eager
face
that
might
have
been
simon
house
for
instance
did
live
in
bethany
i
do
know
anything
about
these
things
eurie
look
if
you
can
find
anything
about
him
the
next
reference
is
matthew
xxvi
and
again
eurie
read
when
jesus
was
in
bethany
in
the
house
of
simon
the
leper
the
very
place
flossy
said
again
oh
i
want
so
much
to
know
what
happened
then
wo
miss
mitchell
read
it
to
us
roberts
said
and
he
arranged
his
shawl
along
the
ground
for
seats
since
we
have
really
come
to
bethany
let
us
have
the
full
benefit
of
it
now
miss
shipley
take
a
seat
and
we
will
give
ourselves
up
to
the
pleasure
of
being
with
jesus
in
simon
house
and
looking
on
at
the
scene
so
they
disposed
of
themselves
on
the
grass
and
eurie
hardly
able
to
restrain
a
laugh
over
the
novelty
of
the
situation
and
yet
wonderfully
fascinated
by
the
whole
scene
read
to
them
the
tender
story
of
the
loving
woman
with
her
ointment
growing
more
and
more
interested
until
in
the
closing
verse
her
voice
was
full
of
feeling
i
say
unto
you
wheresoever
this
gospel
shall
be
preached
in
the
whole
world
there
shall
also
this
that
this
woman
hath
done
be
told
as
a
memorial
of
her
think
of
that
said
roberts
and
here
are
we
eighteen
hundred
years
afterward
sitting
here
in
bethany
and
talking
of
that
same
woman
still
miss
mitchell
are
you
going
to
do
something
for
christ
that
shall
be
talked
over
a
thousand
years
from
now
there
is
a
chance
for
undying
fame
doubtful
eurie
said
but
she
did
not
smile
her
face
was
grave
or
better
still
are
you
going
to
do
such
work
for
christ
that
hundreds
of
years
after
your
influence
will
be
silently
living
and
working
out
its
fruit
in
human
hearts
it
is
altogether
more
likely
that
i
shall
do
nothing
at
all
out
of
the
question
he
said
with
a
grave
smile
either
for
or
against
every
life
must
be
whether
we
will
it
or
not
that
is
not
with
me
is
against
me
was
the
word
of
the
master
himself
and
as
long
as
eternity
lasts
the
fruit
of
the
sowing
will
last
that
is
a
fearfully
solemn
thought
flossy
said
earnestly
roberts
turned
toward
her
a
face
aglow
with
smiles
now
and
a
wondrously
precious
one
he
said
and
flossy
answered
him
in
a
low
tone
yes
i
can
see
that
it
might
be
now
the
actual
fact
is
that
those
three
people
wandered
around
that
land
until
the
morning
vanished
and
the
loud
peal
of
the
chautauqua
bells
announced
the
fact
that
the
feast
of
intellect
was
over
and
it
was
time
for
dinner
they
went
from
bethany
to
bethel
and
from
bethel
to
shechem
and
they
even
climbed
mount
hermon
snowy
peak
and
looked
about
on
the
lovely
plain
below
in
every
place
there
was
bible
reading
and
eurie
was
the
reader
and
it
was
such
a
morning
that
she
will
remember
for
all
time
pray
who
is
this
mr
roberts
she
asked
as
they
parted
company
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
where
did
you
make
his
acquaintance
he
is
smythe
nephew
flossy
said
she
introduced
me
to
him
the
other
evening
the
other
evening
you
seemed
to
be
as
well
acquainted
as
though
you
had
spent
the
summer
together
some
people
have
a
way
of
seeming
like
friends
on
short
acquaintance
flossy
said
with
grave
face
and
smiling
eyes
you
two
missed
a
good
deal
by
your
folly
this
morning
ruth
said
as
they
met
at
dinner
we
had
a
grand
lecture
so
had
we
answered
eurie
significantly
and
that
was
every
word
she
vouchsafed
concerning
the
trip
to
palestine
chapter
xxviii
mental
problems
deems
said
ruth
looking
up
from
her
programme
with
a
thoughtful
air
i
wonder
if
he
is
a
man
whom
i
have
any
special
desire
to
hear
you
must
constantly
remember
the
entire
ignorance
of
these
girls
on
all
names
and
topics
that
pertained
to
the
religious
world
ruth
knew
indeed
that
the
gentleman
in
question
was
a
new
york
clergyman
that
was
as
far
as
her
knowledge
extended
his
subject
is
interesting
flossy
said
i
do
think
it
is
said
eurie
not
to
me
anyhow
nature
and
i
have
nothing
in
common
except
to
have
a
good
time
together
if
we
can
get
it
she
is
a
miserably
disappointed
jade
i
know
what
has
she
done
for
us
since
we
have
been
here
except
to
arrange
rainy
weather
going
to
visit
his
honor
the
mummy
this
morning
and
from
there
i
am
going
to
the
old
pyramid
and
i
advise
you
to
go
with
me
all
of
you
talk
about
nature
when
there
is
an
old
fellow
to
see
who
was
acquainted
with
it
thousands
of
years
ago
nature
is
too
common
an
affair
to
be
interested
in
oh
are
you
going
to
the
museum
said
flossy
then
please
get
me
one
of
the
singing
books
will
you
i
want
to
secure
one
before
they
are
all
gone
girls
do
you
each
want
one
of
them
to
take
home
the
hymns
are
lovely
i
do
said
eurie
unless
he
is
for
sale
to
go
along
and
sing
them
i
ca
imagine
anything
tamer
than
to
hear
some
commonplace
voice
trying
to
do
those
songs
that
he
roars
out
without
any
effort
at
all
what
has
become
of
the
man
he
has
gone
said
marion
called
home
suddenly
some
one
told
me
his
singing
is
splendid
is
it
i
do
know
but
i
feel
much
as
you
do
about
the
book
think
of
having
deacon
miller
try
to
sing
an
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
felt
very
much
as
if
i
were
being
lifted
right
off
my
feet
and
carried
up
somewhere
i
hardly
know
where
when
i
heard
him
sing
that
i
was
coming
down
the
hill
away
off
you
know
by
the
no
away
above
the
and
he
suddenly
burst
forth
i
stopped
to
listen
and
i
could
hear
every
single
word
as
distinctly
as
i
can
hear
you
in
this
tent
hear
said
eurie
i
guess
you
could
i
should
be
surprised
if
they
heard
him
over
at
mayville
and
that
is
what
brings
such
crowds
here
every
day
did
you
ever
anything
like
the
way
the
people
come
here
anyhow
i
do
feel
at
all
as
you
do
said
flossy
going
back
to
the
question
of
after
we
get
let
down
a
little
an
will
sound
very
well
even
from
common
singers
it
has
in
it
what
ca
be
taken
out
because
a
certain
voice
is
lost
and
the
book
is
full
of
other
and
simpler
pieces
and
lovely
choruses
that
people
can
catch
after
one
hearing
flossy
is
going
home
to
introduce
it
into
the
first
church
eurie
said
gravely
flossy
cheeks
flushed
i
had
not
thought
of
that
she
said
simply
perhaps
we
can
in
any
case
get
me
a
couple
eurie
the
discussion
on
the
morning
service
ended
in
a
division
of
the
party
ruth
who
had
come
over
early
on
purpose
to
attend
was
obliged
to
succumb
to
a
feeling
of
utter
weariness
and
lie
down
eurie
steadily
refused
to
go
to
the
platform
meeting
assuring
them
that
she
knew
deems
would
be
as
dry
as
a
stick
all
new
york
ministers
were
so
flossy
and
marion
went
away
together
marion
with
her
in
the
hope
of
getting
an
item
for
a
newspaper
letter
that
must
be
written
that
afternoon
they
were
late
and
almost
abandoned
in
despair
the
hope
of
getting
within
hearing
until
a
happy
thought
suggested
a
seat
on
the
platform
stair
at
the
speaker
back
there
was
a
crack
there
marion
said
into
which
they
presently
crept
the
address
was
already
commenced
marion
listened
at
first
with
that
indifferent
air
that
a
face
wears
when
its
owner
perforce
commences
in
the
middle
of
a
thing
and
has
to
his
way
to
a
tangible
idea
of
what
is
being
said
there
was
not
long
waiting
however
her
eyes
began
to
dilate
and
her
face
to
glow
she
was
almost
a
worshiper
of
eloquence
and
surely
no
one
ever
sat
for
two
hours
and
listened
to
a
more
unbroken
flow
of
rich
glowing
words
shining
like
diamonds
than
fell
lavishly
around
the
listeners
that
friday
morning
at
chautauqua
but
a
few
minutes
and
marion
pencil
began
to
move
with
speed
this
was
the
thought
that
had
thrilled
her
first
light
then
liberation
from
chaos
then
grass
and
then
god
stopped
his
work
and
gazed
with
delight
on
the
picture
he
had
drawn
think
what
a
picture
it
must
have
been
there
was
nothing
but
rocks
ground
down
when
god
said
grow
then
straightway
the
mother
power
fell
down
upon
the
earth
life
pulsed
in
her
veins
and
the
baby
shoot
of
grass
sprang
up
and
the
rocky
earth
wrapped
herself
in
her
garment
of
emerald
and
god
stopping
his
work
said
beautiful
when
the
speaker
touched
upon
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
pencil
paused
and
she
leaned
eagerly
forward
to
get
a
glimpse
of
his
face
that
doctrine
had
seemed
to
her
doubting
heart
the
strangest
wildest
most
hopeless
of
the
christian
theories
if
clear
light
could
shine
on
that
could
there
not
on
her
face
was
aglow
with
interest
not
only
but
with
anxiety
this
morning
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
could
be
called
an
honest
doubter
she
had
fancied
herself
able
to
believe
any
thing
of
which
her
reason
had
been
convinced
but
she
found
to
her
surprise
and
dismay
that
so
fixed
had
the
habit
of
unbelief
become
it
seemed
impossible
to
shake
it
off
and
that
she
needed
to
be
convinced
and
reconvinced
that
her
questionings
came
in
on
every
hand
seized
upon
the
smallest
point
and
tormented
her
without
mercy
what
about
this
strange
story
of
the
resurrection
as
she
listened
a
subdued
smile
broke
over
her
face
a
smile
of
sarcasm
how
very
absurdly
simple
the
argument
from
nature
was
how
utterly
unanswerable
and
after
the
sentence
tell
me
how
that
wonderful
field
of
waving
grain
came
from
the
bare
kernels
of
corn
and
i
will
tell
you
how
my
blessed
baby
shall
rise
an
angel
marion
said
in
tone
so
distinct
that
it
struck
on
flossy
ear
like
a
knell
what
a
fool
not
the
speaker
as
the
dismayed
and
disappointed
flossy
supposed
but
the
measure
of
every
man
is
his
faith
said
deems
the
greatest
thing
a
human
being
can
do
is
not
to
perceive
nor
to
not
to
but
to
and
again
marion
smiled
if
this
were
true
what
a
pigmy
she
must
be
she
began
to
more
than
suspect
that
she
was
do
waste
time
said
the
doctor
in
trying
to
reconcile
science
and
the
bible
science
was
intended
to
teach
religion
the
bible
intended
to
teach
science
but
wherever
they
touch
they
agree
god
sends
his
servants
scientific
men
all
abroad
through
nature
to
gather
facts
with
which
to
illustrate
the
bible
marion
began
to
write
again
but
it
was
only
in
snatches
here
and
there
not
that
there
was
not
that
which
she
longed
to
catch
but
she
could
not
write
it
the
sentences
just
poured
forth
and
how
perfectly
aglow
with
light
and
beauty
they
were
this
one
sentence
she
presently
wrote
in
the
black
ink
of
his
power
god
wrote
the
book
of
nature
in
the
red
ink
of
his
love
he
wrote
the
bible
and
all
this
is
to
bring
us
all
to
this
oh
to
rest
in
arms
like
these
are
they
not
strong
enough
suddenly
marion
closed
her
book
and
slipped
her
pencil
into
her
pocket
she
could
not
write
and
although
she
thrilled
through
every
nerve
over
the
majestic
sentences
that
followed
and
was
carried
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
almost
beyond
her
control
when
the
jubilant
thunder
of
thousands
of
voices
rang
together
in
the
matchless
closing
words
blessing
and
glory
and
thanksgiving
and
honor
and
power
and
might
be
unto
our
god
forever
and
ever
amen
she
made
no
further
attempt
to
write
her
heart
was
full
there
rang
in
it
this
eager
cry
oh
to
rest
in
arms
like
these
strong
enough
aye
indeed
doubts
were
forever
set
at
rest
the
maker
of
all
nature
could
be
none
other
than
god
and
the
god
of
nature
was
the
god
of
the
bible
it
was
as
clear
as
the
sunlight
reason
was
forever
satisfied
but
there
lingered
yet
the
hungering
cry
oh
to
rest
in
arms
like
these
and
flossy
said
not
a
word
to
her
of
the
resting
place
not
because
she
had
not
found
it
strong
and
safe
not
because
she
did
not
long
to
have
her
friend
rest
there
but
because
of
that
despairing
murmur
in
her
heart
what
is
the
use
in
saying
anything
had
she
not
heard
with
her
own
ears
marion
sneering
sentence
in
the
face
of
the
unanswerable
arguments
that
had
been
presented
i
wonder
how
often
we
turn
away
from
harvest
fields
that
are
ready
for
the
reader
because
we
mistake
for
a
sneer
that
which
is
the
admission
of
a
convicted
soul
by
afternoon
ruth
was
rested
and
ready
for
meeting
if
the
truth
be
known
it
was
her
troubled
brain
which
had
tired
her
body
and
obliged
her
to
rest
she
had
begun
to
take
up
that
problem
of
christian
work
the
platform
meeting
of
the
evening
before
and
more
than
anything
else
niles
address
had
fanned
her
heart
into
a
flame
of
desire
to
do
something
for
the
master
but
what
could
she
do
she
and
flossy
had
talked
it
over
together
after
they
reached
their
room
at
the
hotel
in
fact
they
talked
away
into
the
night
i
do
know
flossy
said
with
a
little
laugh
but
i
shall
have
to
depend
on
the
influence
which
i
exert
to
do
my
work
for
me
i
do
know
of
anything
which
i
can
actually
niles
made
a
great
deal
of
that
yes
ruth
said
but
you
see
flossy
the
people
whose
unconscious
influence
does
any
good
are
the
ones
after
all
who
are
moving
around
to
do
something
i
do
feel
sure
that
he
lets
the
unconscious
influence
of
the
drones
amount
to
much
unless
it
is
in
the
wrong
scale
niles
made
a
good
deal
of
you
remember
do
you
like
him
ever
so
much
ruth
why
yes
ruth
said
again
turning
her
pillow
wearily
i
liked
him
of
course
how
could
i
help
it
but
after
all
he
made
me
very
uncomfortable
i
seem
to
feel
as
though
i
find
something
to
do
i
have
a
great
deal
of
time
to
make
up
i
tell
you
what
it
is
flossy
i
wish
you
and
i
could
do
something
for
those
two
girls
is
it
strange
that
they
are
not
interested
but
they
are
not
flossy
said
it
as
positively
as
if
she
could
see
right
into
their
hearts
i
think
marion
is
worse
than
ever
and
as
for
eurie
she
wo
even
go
to
the
meetings
you
know
i
know
perhaps
we
would
only
do
harm
to
try
but
what
we
do
i
am
sure
i
do
see
anything
and
do
you
know
how
clearly
niles
made
it
appear
that
there
was
a
special
work
for
each
one
so
they
discussed
the
question
turning
it
over
and
over
and
getting
almost
no
light
coming
to
feel
themselves
very
useless
and
worthless
specks
on
the
sea
of
life
until
late
in
the
night
flossy
said
i
tell
you
what
it
is
ruth
we
must
just
ask
for
work
little
bits
of
work
you
know
and
then
keep
our
eyes
open
until
it
comes
i
know
of
things
i
can
do
when
i
get
home
so
do
i
said
ruth
but
i
want
to
begin
now
silence
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
flossy
asked
ruthie
have
you
written
to
mr
wayne
no
said
ruth
her
cheeks
flushing
even
in
the
darkness
i
wrote
a
long
letter
just
before
this
came
to
me
but
i
burned
it
and
i
am
glad
of
it
then
they
went
to
sleep
but
the
desire
for
the
work
did
not
fade
with
the
daylight
flossy
had
even
been
tempted
to
say
a
humble
little
word
to
marion
but
had
been
deterred
by
the
sound
of
that
sneer
of
which
i
told
you
and
ruth
lying
on
her
bed
had
revolved
the
subject
and
sent
up
many
an
earnest
prayer
and
went
out
to
afternoon
service
resolved
upon
keeping
her
eyes
very
wide
open
the
special
attraction
for
the
afternoon
was
a
conference
of
primary
class
teachers
they
were
out
in
full
force
and
were
ready
for
any
questions
that
might
fill
the
hearts
and
the
mouths
of
eager
learners
our
girls
had
each
their
special
favorites
among
these
leaders
ruth
found
herself
attracted
and
deeply
interested
in
every
word
that
clark
uttered
marion
was
making
a
study
of
both
knox
and
miss
morris
and
found
it
difficult
to
tell
which
attracted
her
most
even
eurie
was
ready
for
this
meeting
she
had
never
been
able
to
shake
off
the
thought
of
miss
rider
and
her
eager
enthusiasm
in
this
work
while
flossy
had
been
fascinated
and
carried
away
captive
by
the
magnetic
voice
and
manner
of
partridge
she
makes
me
glow
flossy
said
in
trying
to
explain
the
feeling
to
the
calmer
ruth
her
life
seems
to
quiver
all
through
me
and
make
me
long
to
reach
after
it
to
have
the
same
power
which
she
has
over
the
hearts
of
wild
children
and
ruth
looked
down
on
the
exquisite
bit
of
flesh
and
blood
beside
her
and
thought
of
her
elegant
home
and
her
elegant
mother
and
of
all
the
softening
and
enervating
influences
of
her
city
life
and
laughed
how
little
had
she
in
common
with
such
a
work
as
that
to
which
partridge
had
given
her
soul
keeping
her
eyes
open
as
she
had
planned
to
do
this
same
flossy
saw
as
she
was
passing
down
the
aisle
the
hungry
face
of
one
of
her
boys
as
she
had
mentally
called
the
arabs
with
whom
her
life
had
brushed
on
the
sunday
morning
the
word
just
described
it
still
a
hungry
face
like
one
hanging
wistfully
around
the
outskirts
of
a
feast
in
which
he
had
no
share
flossy
let
go
her
hold
of
ruth
arm
and
darted
toward
him
how
do
you
do
she
said
in
winning
voice
before
he
had
even
seen
her
i
am
real
glad
to
see
you
again
if
you
will
come
with
me
i
will
get
a
seat
for
you
a
lady
is
going
to
speak
this
afternoon
who
has
five
hundred
boys
in
her
class
in
now
the
flossy
of
two
weeks
ago
if
she
could
have
imagined
herself
in
any
such
business
would
have
been
utterly
disgusted
with
the
result
and
gone
away
with
her
pretty
nose
very
high
the
boy
turned
his
dirty
face
toward
her
and
said
calmly
what
a
whopper
the
experience
of
a
lifetime
could
not
have
answered
more
deftly
you
come
and
see
i
am
almost
certain
she
will
tell
us
about
some
of
them
still
he
stared
and
flossy
waited
with
her
pretty
face
very
near
to
his
and
her
pretty
hand
held
coaxingly
out
come
she
said
again
and
it
could
not
have
been
more
to
the
surprise
than
it
was
to
hers
that
he
presently
said
well
go
ahead
i
can
send
if
i
do
like
it
i
follow
and
he
did
chapter
xxix
waiting
it
required
flossy
eyes
and
heart
both
to
keep
watch
of
her
boy
during
the
progress
of
that
meeting
the
novelty
of
the
scene
the
strangeness
of
seeing
ladies
occupying
the
speaker
stand
kept
him
quiet
and
alert
until
partridge
that
woman
with
wonderful
power
over
the
forgotten
neglected
portion
of
the
world
arrested
all
his
bewildering
thoughts
and
centered
them
on
the
strange
stories
she
had
to
tell
did
you
ever
hear
her
tell
that
remarkable
story
of
her
first
attempt
at
controlling
that
remarkable
class
which
came
under
her
care
many
years
ago
in
louis
it
is
full
of
wonder
and
pathos
and
terror
and
fascination
even
to
those
who
are
somewhat
familiar
with
such
experiences
but
flossy
and
her
boy
had
never
heard
or
dreamed
of
its
like
no
i
am
wrong
the
boy
had
dreamed
of
scenes
just
so
wild
and
daring
but
even
he
had
not
fancied
that
such
people
ever
found
their
way
to
peanuts
cigars
a
pack
of
cards
and
a
imagine
yourself
teacher
to
be
seated
before
your
orderly
and
courteous
class
of
boys
next
sunday
morning
and
find
them
transformed
into
beings
represented
by
such
surroundings
as
these
it
was
partridge
experience
how
fascinating
that
story
is
that
one
incorrigible
boy
the
one
with
the
the
one
who
would
make
no
answer
to
her
questions
show
no
interest
in
her
stories
ignore
her
very
presence
and
go
on
with
his
horrible
mischief
until
it
even
came
to
a
stabbing
affray
right
there
in
the
imagine
her
meeting
that
boy
ten
years
afterward
when
he
was
not
only
a
man
but
a
gentleman
not
only
that
but
a
christian
and
not
only
that
but
a
working
christian
superintending
a
mission
giving
his
best
energies
and
his
best
time
to
work
like
that
think
of
being
told
by
him
that
the
determination
to
amount
to
something
was
taken
that
morning
ten
years
before
when
he
seemed
not
to
be
listening
nor
caring
what
is
ten
years
of
christian
work
when
we
can
hope
for
such
results
as
that
flossy
had
forgotten
her
charge
her
face
was
all
aglow
so
was
her
heart
she
knew
more
about
christian
work
than
she
did
an
hour
before
she
had
learned
that
we
must
take
the
step
that
plainly
comes
next
to
be
taken
no
matter
for
the
darkness
of
the
day
and
the
apparent
gloom
of
the
future
is
ours
are
god
this
life
business
is
divided
partnership
with
god
nothing
but
to
do
so
that
it
is
done
to
the
utmost
limit
of
our
best
the
responsibility
is
the
lord
that
was
blessed
she
could
dare
to
try
meantime
the
boy
he
had
listened
in
utmost
silence
and
with
eyes
that
never
for
an
instant
left
the
speaker
face
when
the
spell
was
broken
he
drew
a
long
sigh
and
this
was
his
mighty
conclusion
that
chap
was
enough
sight
meaner
than
i
ever
be
and
yet
he
got
to
be
i
be
blamed
if
i
do
see
what
can
be
done
in
that
line
a
small
beginning
so
small
that
on
flossy
face
it
excited
only
smiles
she
was
ignorant
you
know
to
partridge
that
sentence
would
have
been
worth
a
wedge
of
gold
but
it
is
possible
that
first
simple
little
reach
after
work
may
have
fruit
to
bear
it
is
difficult
to
begin
to
tell
about
that
next
day
at
chautauqua
there
was
so
much
crowded
into
it
that
it
would
almost
make
a
little
book
of
itself
the
morning
was
spent
by
a
large
class
of
people
in
a
state
of
excited
unrest
and
expectancy
the
sensible
ones
by
the
hundreds
and
indeed
i
suppose
i
may
say
by
the
thousands
went
to
the
morning
service
as
usual
and
heard
the
children
sermon
delivered
by
newton
and
those
who
did
not
and
who
afterward
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
in
with
those
who
did
bemoaned
their
folly
in
not
doing
likewise
on
the
whole
the
children
and
those
who
had
brains
enough
to
become
children
for
the
time
being
were
the
only
comfortable
ones
at
chautauqua
that
saturday
morning
the
president
was
coming
so
apparently
was
the
rest
of
the
world
oh
the
throngs
and
throngs
that
continually
arrived
it
of
itself
was
a
rare
and
novelty
to
those
who
had
never
in
their
lives
before
seen
such
a
vast
army
of
human
beings
gathered
into
a
small
space
and
all
perfectly
quiet
and
correct
and
even
courteous
in
their
deportment
where
are
the
drunken
men
said
marion
looking
around
curiously
on
the
constantly
increasing
throng
we
always
read
of
them
as
being
in
great
crowds
yes
and
the
people
who
swear
added
eurie
i
have
heard
an
oath
this
morning
and
i
have
roamed
around
everywhere
i
must
say
chautauqua
will
bear
off
the
palm
for
getting
together
a
most
that
is
what
i
overheard
a
old
gentleman
who
does
approve
of
having
a
president
or
of
letting
him
come
to
a
religious
meeting
i
do
know
which
say
would
rush
in
it
certainly
is
a
remarkably
orderly
girls
look
at
vincent
i
declare
chautauqua
has
paid
just
to
watch
him
he
ought
to
be
the
president
himself
i
mean
to
vote
for
him
when
female
suffrage
comes
in
or
a
king
would
he
make
a
grand
king
how
he
would
enjoy
ordering
the
subjects
and
enforcing
his
laws
all
of
which
he
seems
able
to
do
now
marion
said
i
do
believe
he
would
thank
you
for
a
vote
his
realm
is
large
enough
and
he
seems
to
have
willing
subjects
he
has
eurie
said
what
is
the
proper
word
for
that
executive
ability
that
it
those
are
splendid
words
and
they
ought
to
be
added
to
his
name
i
tell
you
what
girls
i
wish
we
could
cut
him
up
into
seven
men
and
take
him
home
with
us
seven
men
made
out
of
him
and
distributed
through
the
towns
about
us
would
make
a
new
order
of
things
all
this
was
being
said
while
they
were
scrambling
with
the
rest
of
the
world
down
to
the
auditorium
to
secure
seats
for
the
grand
afternoon
had
arrived
and
people
had
been
advised
to
be
in
their
seats
as
soon
after
one
as
they
could
make
it
convenient
how
soon
will
that
be
i
wonder
marion
said
quoting
this
sentence
from
vincent
advice
given
in
the
morning
and
holding
up
her
watch
to
show
that
it
was
five
minutes
of
one
it
looks
to
me
as
though
those
deluded
beings
who
arrive
here
at
one
will
have
several
hours
of
patient
waiting
before
they
will
make
it
convenient
to
secure
seats
just
stand
a
minute
girls
and
look
it
is
worth
seeing
away
back
just
as
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
nothing
but
heads
the
aisles
are
full
and
space
between
the
seats
and
the
office
is
full
and
the
people
are
just
pouring
down
from
the
hill
in
a
continuous
stream
to
look
that
way
you
would
think
that
any
had
got
down
here
yet
now
i
really
wish
i
had
a
photograph
of
that
gathering
of
people
to
put
right
in
here
on
this
page
many
of
them
would
have
looked
much
better
at
this
point
than
they
did
after
four
hours
of
patient
waiting
how
that
crowd
did
fidget
and
fix
and
change
position
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
change
when
there
was
not
an
inch
of
unoccupied
space
how
they
talked
and
laughed
and
sang
and
grumbled
and
yawned
and
sang
again
it
a
tedious
waiting
it
had
its
irresistibly
comic
side
there
were
those
among
the
chautauqua
girls
who
could
see
the
comic
side
of
things
with
very
little
trouble
the
material
out
of
which
they
made
some
of
their
fun
might
have
appeared
very
meager
to
orderly
decorous
people
but
they
made
it
what
infinite
sport
they
got
out
of
the
fidgety
lady
before
them
who
could
not
get
herself
and
her
three
children
seated
to
her
mind
those
ladies
who
labored
so
industriously
in
order
that
the
nation
flags
draping
the
stand
should
float
gracefully
over
the
nation
chief
were
an
almost
inexhaustible
source
of
amusement
to
our
girls
look
said
eurie
that
arrangement
does
suit
some
of
the
stars
are
hidden
see
them
twitch
it
it
will
be
down
now
that
one
has
it
looped
just
to
her
fancy
no
i
declare
there
it
comes
down
again
the
other
one
twitched
it
this
time
they
are
not
of
the
same
mind
girls
do
look
it
is
fun
to
watch
them
they
work
as
though
the
interests
of
this
meeting
all
turned
on
a
right
arrangement
of
that
flag
by
this
time
the
attention
of
the
girls
was
engaged
and
the
number
of
witty
remarks
that
were
made
at
the
expense
of
those
flags
would
no
doubt
have
disconcerted
the
earnest
workers
thereat
could
they
have
heard
them
the
hours
waned
and
the
president
did
not
arrive
the
waiters
essayed
to
sing
but
to
lead
such
an
army
of
people
was
a
difficult
task
especially
when
there
was
no
one
to
lead
such
singing
we
came
out
ahead
anyhow
said
flossy
stopping
to
laugh
five
or
six
thousand
people
had
finished
their
verse
while
five
or
six
thousand
in
the
rear
were
in
the
third
line
of
it
we
need
bliss
or
sherwin
or
said
ruth
what
a
pity
that
they
have
all
gone
and
tourjée
has
come
i
thought
he
was
to
be
here
presently
came
a
singer
to
their
rescue
the
girls
did
not
know
who
he
was
but
he
led
well
and
the
singing
became
decidedly
enjoyable
suddenly
he
disappeared
and
they
went
back
again
into
utter
confusion
they
stopped
singing
and
began
to
grumble
queer
arrangements
anyhow
said
a
man
in
front
why
did
they
have
a
speaker
ready
to
address
this
throng
instead
of
keeping
us
waiting
here
with
nothing
to
entertain
us
i
know
it
said
marion
briskly
addressing
herself
to
her
party
vincent
has
not
used
his
accustomed
foresight
he
ought
to
have
known
that
the
presidential
party
would
be
three
hours
late
and
filled
up
the
programme
with
speeches
especially
since
there
has
been
such
a
dearth
of
during
the
past
two
weeks
we
are
really
hungry
for
an
address
i
do
know
who
would
have
undertaken
the
task
however
unless
they
sent
for
gabriel
or
some
other
celestial
i
know
have
no
desire
to
listen
to
a
common
mortal
before
them
sat
a
lady
absorbed
in
a
book
during
the
singing
she
joined
heartily
and
when
vincent
came
on
one
of
his
numerous
journeys
to
try
to
encourage
the
crowd
with
the
information
that
the
party
waited
for
had
not
yet
arrived
she
looked
and
listened
with
the
rest
but
always
with
her
finger
between
the
leaves
as
if
the
place
was
too
interesting
to
be
lost
eurie
curiosity
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
she
leaned
forward
for
a
peep
at
the
and
drew
back
suddenly
it
was
a
copy
of
the
teacher
bible
a
silence
fell
upon
the
company
near
the
front
broken
suddenly
by
an
old
lady
who
leaned
lovingly
toward
her
grandson
and
said
frankie
you
must
look
in
a
few
minutes
and
you
will
see
the
president
of
the
united
states
that
is
good
news
anyhow
spoke
forth
a
man
near
by
and
the
listeners
who
were
in
that
excited
state
of
weariness
and
waiting
that
they
were
ready
to
laugh
or
cry
as
the
slightest
occasion
offered
burst
forth
into
roars
of
laughter
which
rang
back
among
the
crowds
behind
and
enticed
them
to
join
though
i
suppose
not
twenty
of
the
laughers
knew
what
the
joke
was
if
indeed
there
one
a
sudden
rush
some
one
occupied
the
stand
a
notice
a
telegram
said
a
ringing
voice
for
hammond
marked
a
sympathetic
murmur
ran
through
the
great
company
as
they
moved
and
wedged
and
fell
back
and
did
almost
impossible
things
to
make
a
road
out
of
that
dense
throng
of
humanity
for
the
one
to
whom
the
president
had
suddenly
become
an
insignificance
just
then
came
the
wyoming
trio
blessings
on
them
whoever
they
are
nothing
ever
could
have
fitted
in
more
splendidly
than
they
did
just
there
and
then
and
the
singing
rested
and
helped
them
all
now
a
sensation
came
in
the
shape
of
a
poem
that
had
been
written
for
the
occasion
and
was
to
be
learned
to
sing
in
greeting
to
the
president
how
they
rang
those
jubilant
words
through
those
old
trees
tender
touching
words
with
the
chautauqua
quivering
all
through
them
greet
him
let
the
air
around
him
benedictions
bear
let
the
hearts
of
all
the
people
circle
him
with
prayer
i
wonder
if
he
realizes
what
a
blessed
thing
it
is
to
be
circled
with
prayer
said
she
of
the
teacher
bible
turning
a
thoughtful
face
upon
the
four
girls
who
had
attracted
her
attention
i
wonder
who
mary
lathbury
is
said
eurie
reading
from
the
poem
she
is
a
poet
whoever
she
is
there
is
a
line
in
this
that
is
simply
i
doubt
if
the
president
ever
had
such
a
rhythmical
tribute
as
that
she
is
the
lady
with
blue
eyes
and
curls
who
designs
the
pictures
in
that
charming
child
paper
which
flutters
around
here
i
have
forgotten
the
name
of
it
but
the
pictures
are
little
poems
themselves
this
was
flossy
bit
of
information
which
designs
them
the
blue
eyes
or
the
curls
marion
asked
gravely
and
then
these
four
simpletons
burst
into
a
merry
laugh
still
the
president
did
not
appear
the
audience
had
exhausted
their
resources
and
their
good
humor
ominous
grumblings
and
cross
faces
began
to
predominate
some
darkly
hinted
that
he
was
not
coming
at
all
and
that
this
was
a
design
to
draw
the
immense
crowd
together
nobody
believed
it
but
many
were
in
a
mood
to
pretend
that
they
did
i
never
believed
in
this
thing
said
a
tall
man
speaking
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
interest
the
crowd
in
front
this
sensation
business
i
do
believe
in
what
do
we
want
of
the
president
here
who
cares
to
see
him
i
do
like
it
i
believe
it
is
all
wrong
turning
a
religious
meeting
upside
down
for
a
sensation
and
i
told
them
so
our
friend
marion
you
will
remember
was
gifted
with
a
clear
voice
and
a
saucy
tongue
if
he
does
like
it
she
said
quickly
and
does
want
to
see
the
president
why
do
you
suppose
he
has
kept
one
of
the
best
chairs
for
four
mortal
hours
do
you
think
that
is
selfish
which
sentence
caused
ripples
of
laughter
all
about
them
and
quenched
the
man
but
it
was
growing
serious
this
waiting
it
was
a
great
army
of
people
to
be
kept
at
rest
and
though
they
had
been
quiet
and
decorous
enough
thus
far
it
was
not
to
be
presumed
that
they
were
all
people
governed
by
nice
shades
of
propriety
would
the
disappointment
break
forth
into
any
disagreeable
demonstrations
vincent
had
done
what
he
could
he
had
appeared
promptly
on
the
arrival
of
dispatches
and
given
the
latest
news
that
the
telegraph
and
the
telescope
would
send
but
what
can
any
mortal
man
do
who
has
arranged
for
people
to
come
who
do
not
come
except
wait
for
them
with
what
patience
he
can
command
at
this
ominous
moment
he
appeared
before
them
again
not
a
notice
this
time
something
which
shone
in
his
eyes
and
quivered
in
every
vein
and
rang
in
his
voice
this
was
what
he
said
chapter
xxx
settled
questions
dear
friends
i
should
bear
a
burden
on
my
conscience
if
i
did
not
come
to
you
with
the
old
story
over
the
tent
which
has
been
prepared
for
the
president
of
the
united
states
there
glows
done
in
evergreen
this
single
word
as
i
pass
it
i
am
reminded
of
another
and
a
different
rest
the
rest
from
every
burden
every
anxiety
every
pain
every
sin
who
has
rested
in
those
everlasting
arms
there
is
coming
a
day
when
all
this
throng
of
human
life
gathered
here
shall
wait
for
the
coming
of
the
king
yea
even
the
of
kings
should
that
time
be
who
is
ready
do
you
know
his
power
do
you
know
his
grace
do
you
know
his
love
through
the
atonement
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
every
one
of
you
may
have
that
king
for
your
father
i
am
commissioned
this
day
to
bring
this
invitation
to
each
one
of
you
unto
me
all
ye
that
are
heavy
laden
and
i
will
give
you
rest
will
you
come
pardon
this
interruption
no
i
will
not
ask
your
pardon
it
is
never
an
interruption
to
bring
good
news
from
the
king
to
his
subjects
i
will
not
weary
you
with
a
long
presentation
i
have
only
this
message
you
are
all
invited
to
come
to
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
be
saved
from
every
possible
calamity
you
are
all
invited
to
come
now
i
am
going
to
ask
the
tennesseeans
to
sing
one
of
my
favorites
do
stay
away
for
my
lord
says
there
room
enough
room
enough
in
the
heaven
for
you
never
were
tender
words
more
tenderly
sung
never
did
they
steal
out
upon
the
hearts
of
a
more
hushed
and
solemn
audience
that
matchless
word
of
gospel
had
touched
home
there
were
those
in
the
crowd
who
had
never
realized
before
that
the
invitation
was
for
them
following
the
hymn
came
another
suggested
also
by
vincent
steal
away
to
jesus
it
is
one
of
the
sweetest
as
well
as
one
of
the
strangest
of
african
melodies
and
as
the
tender
message
floated
up
among
the
trees
a
strange
hush
settled
over
the
listeners
many
tears
were
quietly
wiped
away
from
eyes
unused
to
weeping
now
sing
persuaded
said
vincent
his
own
voice
tremulous
with
his
highly
wrought
feeling
many
voices
took
that
up
even
the
chautauqua
girls
sang
all
but
eurie
with
the
sentence
seems
now
some
soul
to
say
go
spirit
go
thy
way
some
more
convenient
day
on
thee
i
call
flossy
tamed
her
anxious
appealing
eyes
on
eurie
but
she
was
laughing
merrily
over
the
attempt
of
a
feeble
old
man
near
her
to
join
in
the
song
and
flossy
whispered
sadly
to
ruth
eurie
has
not
even
as
much
interest
as
that
the
spell
of
the
message
and
the
music
lingered
even
after
vincent
had
gone
again
there
was
no
more
grumbling
there
was
very
little
laughing
a
subdued
spirit
seemed
to
brood
over
the
great
company
we
could
almost
have
a
revival
right
here
said
one
thoughtful
man
looking
with
searching
eyes
up
and
down
the
sea
of
faces
i
tell
you
no
grander
opportunity
was
ever
more
grandly
improved
than
by
those
few
words
of
vincent
they
touched
bottom
he
will
meet
those
words
again
with
joy
or
i
am
mistaken
but
the
waiting
was
over
suddenly
the
chautauqua
bells
began
to
peal
strains
of
martial
music
and
the
roll
of
drums
mingled
with
the
booming
of
cannon
and
almost
before
they
were
aware
even
after
all
their
waiting
twenty
thousand
people
stood
face
to
face
with
their
nation
chief
when
the
president
head
appears
above
this
platform
i
hope
it
will
thunder
here
had
been
vincent
suggestion
several
hours
before
thunder
that
was
no
comparison
i
hope
even
was
satisfied
then
how
that
song
of
greeting
rung
out
tender
still
even
in
its
power
let
the
hearts
of
all
the
people
circle
him
with
prayer
no
better
gift
for
him
than
that
after
the
cheering
and
the
singing
and
the
very
brief
speech
from
the
president
himself
came
the
address
of
welcome
by
fowler
of
chicago
his
first
sentence
sent
the
multitude
into
another
storm
of
cheers
said
he
the
work
that
i
thought
to
do
has
been
done
by
twenty
thousand
people
how
could
they
help
doing
it
again
after
that
chautauqua
had
not
dropped
her
colors
in
this
plan
of
an
afternoon
given
to
the
president
the
address
of
welcome
from
first
to
last
rang
with
the
gospel
invitation
come
no
better
word
than
that
even
for
their
chief
honor
to
whom
honor
is
due
quoted
the
speaker
and
then
followed
his
graceful
tribute
but
it
closed
with
a
tender
dignified
earnest
appeal
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
in
the
same
refuge
to
enlist
under
the
same
flag
to
be
loyal
to
the
same
chief
whom
they
were
met
to
serve
out
of
my
heart
said
he
as
a
man
who
recognizes
god
as
the
supreme
ruler
of
us
all
i
bid
you
come
with
us
and
we
will
do
you
good
for
the
lord
hath
spoken
good
concerning
israel
poor
eurie
what
a
place
she
had
chosen
if
she
desired
to
hear
no
more
preaching
what
were
all
these
exercises
but
sermons
one
after
the
other
strong
warm
unanswerable
appeals
to
be
loyal
to
the
great
chief
certainly
deems
was
not
the
man
to
forget
the
greater
in
his
greeting
to
the
under
ruler
nor
did
he
let
me
speak
to
you
in
closing
said
he
to
you
and
to
this
assembly
out
of
my
heart
we
shall
never
all
stand
together
again
until
that
great
white
throne
shall
stop
in
mid
heavens
and
we
shall
stand
to
meet
the
chiefest
of
all
chiefs
o
men
and
brethren
shall
we
not
all
prepare
to
meet
there
president
every
day
prayer
is
made
for
you
we
are
hoping
to
meet
with
you
in
heaven
brave
men
who
stood
beside
you
in
the
late
war
and
have
gone
on
ahead
are
hoping
to
greet
you
there
may
you
have
a
good
life
a
happy
life
a
blessed
life
and
may
other
tongues
more
eloquent
than
mine
more
eloquent
than
even
my
brother
who
preceded
me
bid
you
welcome
one
day
to
the
general
assembly
of
the
first
born
amen
and
amen
what
could
better
close
the
matchless
greetings
than
to
have
the
tennesseeans
circle
round
their
president
and
sing
again
that
ringing
chorus
i
been
redeemed
been
washed
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
the
grumblers
marion
said
as
they
rested
in
various
stages
of
dishabille
and
talked
the
exciting
scenes
over
they
have
been
shamefully
left
in
the
lurch
they
were
going
to
have
this
affair
a
demoralizing
dissipation
from
first
to
last
unworthy
of
the
spirit
of
chautauqua
and
if
more
solemn
or
more
searching
or
more
effective
preaching
could
be
crowded
into
an
afternoon
than
has
been
done
here
i
should
like
to
be
shown
how
what
do
you
think
of
your
choice
of
entertainments
eurie
you
thought
it
would
be
safe
to
attend
the
president
reception
you
remember
i
do
tell
all
i
think
eurie
answered
and
then
she
went
out
among
the
trees
truth
to
tell
eurie
had
heard
that
from
which
she
could
not
get
away
vincent
words
were
still
sounding
you
are
invited
to
come
to
jesus
and
be
saved
you
are
invited
to
come
there
had
been
nothing
to
dissipate
that
impression
everything
to
deepen
it
and
the
thought
that
clung
and
repeated
itself
to
her
heart
was
that
plaintive
wail
almost
persuaded
now
to
believe
that
was
certainly
herself
she
felt
it
knew
it
in
the
face
of
that
knowledge
think
how
solemn
the
words
grew
almost
will
not
prevail
almost
is
but
to
fail
sad
sad
that
bitter
wail
almost
but
lost
was
that
for
her
too
in
short
eurie
out
there
alone
among
the
silent
trees
felt
and
admitted
this
fact
that
the
time
had
actually
come
to
her
when
this
question
must
be
decided
either
for
or
against
and
decided
forever
sunday
morning
at
chautauqua
a
white
day
there
can
be
none
of
all
that
throng
who
spent
the
day
of
august
in
that
sacred
place
who
remember
it
without
a
thrill
a
perfect
day
glorious
and
glowing
sunshine
everywhere
and
beauty
such
perfect
beauty
of
lake
and
grove
the
god
of
nature
smiled
lovingly
on
chautauqua
that
morning
our
girls
seemed
to
think
that
the
perfect
day
required
perfection
of
attire
and
it
was
noticeable
that
the
taste
of
each
settled
on
spotless
white
without
color
or
ornament
other
than
a
spray
of
leaves
and
grasses
which
one
and
another
of
them
gathered
almost
without
knowing
it
and
placed
in
belt
or
hair
outward
calm
but
inward
unrest
at
least
so
far
as
some
were
concerned
marion
wilbur
among
the
number
it
was
a
very
heavy
heart
that
she
carried
that
day
there
was
no
unbelief
that
demon
was
conquered
instead
there
was
an
overpowering
terrible
and
now
came
satan
with
the
whole
of
her
past
life
which
had
turned
to
sin
before
her
and
hurled
it
on
her
poor
shrinking
shoulders
until
she
felt
almost
to
faint
beneath
the
load
she
lay
miserably
on
her
bed
and
thought
that
she
would
not
add
to
her
burden
by
going
to
the
service
that
she
knew
already
too
much
but
an
appeal
from
flossy
to
keep
her
company
as
the
others
had
gone
had
the
effect
of
changing
her
mind
armed
each
with
a
they
made
their
way
to
the
stand
after
the
great
congregation
were
seated
a
fortunate
thought
those
had
been
there
was
not
a
vacant
seat
anywhere
marion
placed
her
chair
out
of
sight
both
of
stand
and
speaker
but
within
hearing
and
gave
herself
up
to
her
own
troubled
thoughts
until
the
opening
exercises
were
concluded
and
the
preacher
announced
his
text
the
place
that
is
called
calvary
she
roused
a
little
and
tried
to
determine
whose
voice
it
was
it
had
a
familiar
sound
but
she
could
not
be
sure
and
she
tried
to
go
back
to
the
useless
questionings
of
her
own
heart
but
she
could
not
she
could
never
be
deaf
to
eloquence
whoever
the
speaker
was
there
was
that
in
his
very
opening
sentences
which
roused
and
held
her
whatever
he
had
to
say
whether
or
not
it
was
anything
that
had
to
do
with
her
she
listen
still
the
wonderment
existed
as
to
which
voice
it
was
but
when
he
reached
the
sentences
jump
the
ages
come
down
here
to
chautauqua
lake
o
son
of
god
o
son
of
man
o
son
of
mary
when
the
prophet
of
old
said
shall
see
of
the
travail
of
his
soul
and
shall
be
satisfied
did
he
look
along
the
centuries
and
see
the
gathered
thousands
here
who
have
just
sung
me
the
old
old
story
what
story
why
the
story
of
the
place
that
is
called
calvary
marion
leaned
forward
and
addressed
the
person
next
to
her
is
that
dr
deems
she
said
yes
indeed
was
the
answer
spoken
with
enthusiasm
and
marion
drew
back
and
listened
that
sermon
marion
tried
to
report
it
but
it
was
like
trying
to
report
the
roll
of
the
waves
on
the
atlantic
she
could
only
listen
with
beating
heart
and
flushing
cheek
presently
she
listened
with
a
new
interest
for
the
divisions
of
the
subject
were
god
thought
of
sin
and
god
thought
of
mercy
though
the
morning
was
warm
she
shivered
and
drew
her
wrap
closer
about
her
god
thought
of
sin
she
was
in
a
mood
to
comprehend
in
a
measure
what
a
fearful
thought
it
might
be
some
men
said
the
speaker
make
light
of
sin
yes
she
had
done
it
herself
where
shall
we
learn
what
god
thinks
of
it
on
sinai
no
god
spoke
there
in
thunder
and
lightning
till
the
very
shook
and
trembled
and
what
were
they
doing
down
below
dancing
around
a
golden
calf
i
tell
you
it
is
only
at
calvary
that
we
can
learn
god
idea
of
sin
for
at
calvary
because
of
sin
god
the
father
surrendered
his
communion
with
god
the
son
and
on
calvary
god
will
god
ever
forgive
sin
many
a
one
has
carried
that
question
around
in
his
soul
until
it
burned
there
now
you
can
imagine
how
marion
tried
no
more
to
write
thought
no
more
about
eloquence
this
question
which
had
become
to
her
the
one
terrible
question
of
life
was
being
looked
into
how
will
we
find
out
go
by
science
into
nature
and
there
no
proof
of
it
god
never
forgives
what
seems
to
be
the
mistake
of
even
a
reptile
i
can
not
tell
you
about
the
rest
of
that
sermon
i
took
no
notes
of
it
my
notes
ended
abruptly
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
one
can
not
write
out
words
that
are
piercing
to
their
hearts
i
doubt
if
even
marion
wilbur
can
give
you
any
satisfactory
account
of
the
wording
of
the
sentences
and
yet
marion
wilbur
rose
up
at
its
close
with
cheeks
aglow
not
only
with
tears
but
smiles
and
the
question
will
god
ever
forgive
sin
she
could
answer
there
was
a
place
where
the
burden
would
roll
away
at
the
place
called
calvary
she
knew
it
believed
it
felt
it
why
should
she
not
she
had
been
there
in
very
deed
that
summer
morning
he
had
seen
again
of
the
travail
of
his
soul
he
was
one
soul
nearer
to
being
satisfied
there
were
other
matters
of
interest
those
two
bibles
symbol
of
the
chautauqua
pulse
that
were
presented
to
the
nation
highest
officer
the
address
which
accompanied
them
simple
earnest
gospel
the
hymn
they
sang
was
full
of
interest
but
marion
let
it
pass
by
her
like
the
sound
of
music
and
the
words
in
her
heart
that
kept
time
to
it
all
were
the
closing
words
of
that
sermon
here
i
could
forever
stay
sit
and
my
life
away
this
is
more
than
life
to
me
lovely
mournful
calvary
it
was
so
all
day
she
went
to
the
afternoon
service
she
listened
to
fowler
sermon
not
as
she
had
ever
listened
to
one
before
the
sermon
for
the
first
time
was
for
her
when
people
listen
for
there
is
a
difference
she
felt
fed
and
strengthened
she
joined
in
the
singing
as
her
voice
had
never
joined
before
they
were
singing
about
saviour
then
she
went
back
to
her
tent
i
am
not
going
she
said
to
the
girls
i
am
full
i
want
nothing
more
preached
out
i
declare
said
eurie
are
you
going
to
write
out
your
report
for
the
paper
i
would
marion
i
would
go
to
the
meeting
i
am
going
no
said
marion
in
answer
to
the
question
and
smiling
at
the
thought
how
strange
it
would
seem
to
her
to
spend
sabbath
evening
thus
how
many
had
she
so
spent
i
am
glad
is
the
last
day
she
said
sinking
into
a
chair
i
want
to
go
home
and
flossy
and
ruth
looked
at
each
other
and
sighed
how
well
these
girls
understood
one
another
why
ca
people
be
frank
and
speak
so
that
they
can
be
understood
suppose
marion
had
said
no
i
am
going
to
write
my
report
i
am
going
to
pray
suppose
she
had
said
yes
i
want
to
go
home
to
chapter
xxxi
the
beginning
of
the
end
it
is
a
troublesome
fact
that
even
when
people
are
very
much
interested
and
very
eager
over
important
themes
commonplace
and
comparatively
trivial
duties
will
intrude
and
insist
upon
being
done
at
that
moment
for
instance
our
girls
were
obliged
to
spend
the
whole
of
monday
morning
in
packing
their
trunks
and
satchels
returning
their
furniture
settling
for
their
tents
and
the
like
in
short
breaking
up
housekeeping
and
getting
ready
to
go
back
to
the
civilized
world
flossy
and
ruth
dispatched
their
part
at
the
hotel
promptly
and
came
over
to
the
grounds
to
help
the
others
they
discussed
the
meeting
while
they
worked
if
we
had
been
idiots
marion
said
we
should
have
attended
that
normal
class
and
been
graduating
this
morning
instead
of
being
down
here
at
work
at
our
trunks
and
unknown
to
fame
well
you
would
go
ruth
answered
do
you
know
you
declared
that
was
too
much
like
work
and
you
had
an
idea
of
learning
anything
oh
yes
said
marion
i
remember
a
great
many
things
i
have
said
that
i
would
quite
as
soon
forget
by
dint
of
eager
bustling
from
one
point
to
another
the
work
was
accomplished
by
noon
and
all
the
girls
were
ready
for
the
afternoon
service
which
all
seemed
equally
eager
to
attend
when
they
reached
the
stand
they
looked
about
them
in
surprise
and
dismay
everybody
is
gone
said
flossy
only
look
there
are
ever
so
many
unoccupied
seats
marion
laughed
and
ever
so
many
that
are
occupied
she
said
my
child
you
have
been
so
used
to
counting
audiences
by
the
thousands
that
sixteen
or
seventeen
hundred
people
look
rather
commonplace
to
you
however
there
are
more
than
that
number
here
i
think
it
soon
became
a
matter
of
small
importance
whether
there
were
few
or
many
so
long
as
they
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
there
themselves
and
to
have
the
company
of
eben
tourjée
now
it
so
happened
that
among
these
four
girls
there
were
two
to
whom
god
had
given
special
gifts
though
neither
of
them
had
ever
considered
that
there
were
such
things
as
gifts
from
god
which
they
were
bound
to
use
in
his
service
there
was
ruth
erskine
who
had
capabilities
for
music
in
the
ends
of
her
fingers
that
would
have
almost
entranced
the
angels
what
did
she
do
with
her
talent
almost
nothing
she
hated
the
sickly
sentimentalities
which
set
to
music
find
their
way
into
fashionable
parlors
by
the
score
she
was
not
in
the
society
that
knew
of
or
craved
the
higher
grander
kind
of
music
and
because
she
did
and
did
not
know
it
she
simply
palled
of
the
kind
within
her
reach
and
let
her
gift
lie
waste
then
there
was
marion
whose
voice
was
simply
grand
both
in
power
and
tone
what
had
she
done
with
her
voice
sung
by
the
hour
to
the
old
father
whose
tender
memory
lingered
with
her
less
than
nothing
with
it
since
no
one
knew
she
could
sing
she
hated
singing
in
school
she
never
went
anywhere
else
so
only
occasionally
could
the
four
walls
of
her
upper
back
room
have
testified
that
there
was
a
talent
buried
there
did
tourjée
travel
from
boston
to
chautauqua
for
the
purpose
of
inspiring
and
educating
these
two
girls
i
do
suppose
he
knew
of
their
existence
but
that
makes
no
difference
they
are
working
out
his
lecture
all
the
same
in
fact
it
is
nearly
a
year
since
these
chautauqua
girls
came
home
and
if
you
have
any
sort
of
desire
to
know
what
chautauqua
theories
develop
into
when
put
to
the
test
please
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
chautauqua
girls
at
as
the
familiar
talk
on
music
went
on
ruth
with
her
eyes
aglow
began
to
plan
in
her
own
heart
first
what
she
do
and
presently
what
she
do
and
marion
at
the
other
end
of
the
seat
went
through
the
same
process
neither
imagining
that
these
same
would
bring
them
together
and
lead
to
endless
other
doings
but
that
is
just
the
way
in
which
life
is
going
on
every
where
who
imagined
that
what
you
did
yesterday
would
lead
your
neighbor
to
do
what
he
done
luther
said
to
theology
i
place
sacred
music
this
was
the
sentence
that
started
a
train
of
thought
for
ruth
after
that
she
listened
in
order
that
she
might
work
never
use
an
interlude
in
church
i
pray
god
that
i
may
be
forgiven
for
the
that
i
have
strummed
on
organs
in
the
name
of
interludes
this
delighted
marion
she
hated
interludes
she
hated
quartette
choirs
she
had
steadily
refused
to
be
beguiled
into
one
by
the
few
who
knew
that
she
could
sing
so
when
tourjée
said
think
of
the
grand
old
hymn
all
that
dwell
below
the
skies
let
the
creator
praise
arise
being
warbled
by
one
voice
a
grand
chorus
of
four
coming
in
on
the
third
line
marion
was
entirely
in
sympathy
with
him
and
eager
for
work
in
the
way
in
which
he
pointed
out
it
was
an
enjoyable
afternoon
in
every
respect
but
to
our
girls
it
was
much
more
than
that
it
was
an
education
every
one
of
them
got
ideas
which
they
were
eager
to
put
in
practice
and
they
saw
their
ways
clear
to
practise
them
to
some
purpose
when
the
service
was
over
and
the
audience
moved
away
a
sense
of
sadness
and
lonliness
began
to
creep
over
many
snatches
of
remark
could
be
heard
on
all
sides
where
is
dr
fowler
gone
went
this
morning
where
is
the
miller
party
oh
they
went
some
time
ago
when
did
the
president
leave
it
all
about
eurie
said
look
how
they
are
crowding
down
to
the
boat
and
only
a
stray
one
now
and
then
coming
up
from
there
who
would
have
supposed
it
could
make
us
feel
so
forlorn
i
am
glad
we
are
not
to
be
at
the
morning
meeting
i
am
not
sure
but
i
should
cry
of
homesickness
i
say
girls
let
go
to
palestine
which
suggestion
was
greeted
with
delight
and
they
immediately
went
a
great
many
were
of
the
same
mind
vanlennep
in
full
turkish
dress
was
leading
the
way
and
giving
his
familiar
lecture
on
the
to
him
familiar
spots
the
girls
stood
near
him
by
the
sea
of
galilee
and
heard
his
tender
farewell
words
and
his
hope
that
they
would
all
meet
on
the
other
side
of
jordon
it
was
hard
to
keep
back
the
quiet
tears
from
falling
they
climbed
mount
hermon
in
silence
and
looked
over
at
mount
lebanon
they
came
back
by
the
way
of
cesarea
and
turned
aside
to
take
a
last
look
at
joppa
down
by
the
sea
in
almost
total
silence
this
walk
back
was
accomplished
what
was
the
matter
with
them
all
roberts
had
joined
them
and
he
and
flossy
walked
on
ahead
but
their
voices
were
subdued
and
their
subject
to
judge
from
their
faces
to
say
the
least
then
they
all
went
to
take
their
last
supper
at
chautauqua
not
one
of
them
grumbled
over
anything
indeed
they
all
agreed
that
the
board
had
certainly
improved
very
much
during
the
last
few
days
and
that
it
was
really
remarkable
that
such
a
throng
of
people
could
have
been
served
so
promptly
and
courteously
and
on
the
whole
so
well
as
had
been
done
there
still
it
was
strange
to
have
plenty
of
elbow
room
and
to
see
the
waiters
moving
leisurely
up
and
down
the
long
halls
no
one
in
haste
no
one
kept
waiting
as
they
rose
from
table
a
gentleman
passed
through
they
had
passed
each
other
every
day
for
a
week
they
had
no
idea
what
his
name
was
and
i
suppose
he
knew
as
little
about
them
but
he
paused
before
them
he
said
and
held
out
his
hand
i
hope
we
shall
all
meet
at
the
assembly
up
there
they
answered
and
they
shook
hands
none
of
them
smiled
none
of
them
thought
it
strange
though
they
had
never
been
introduced
it
was
the
chautauqua
brotherhood
of
feeling
but
after
two
weeks
of
experience
and
much
practice
in
that
line
it
was
impossible
to
rid
onesself
of
the
feeling
that
one
must
hurry
down
to
the
stand
in
order
to
secure
seats
so
they
hurried
and
had
a
new
experience
they
were
among
the
first
twenty
on
the
ground
the
audience
will
be
utterly
lost
in
this
immense
array
of
seats
flossy
said
in
dismay
does
it
feel
forlorn
but
they
took
their
seats
and
presently
came
miss
ryder
and
seated
herself
at
the
piano
in
the
twilight
and
the
tunes
she
played
were
soft
and
tender
and
weird
every
note
says
said
ruth
and
she
gave
a
little
sigh
presently
the
calcium
lights
began
to
glow
as
usual
and
meantime
though
everybody
was
supposed
to
have
left
still
the
people
came
from
somewhere
and
at
last
dismayed
voices
began
to
say
why
did
you
ever
see
the
like
i
thought
we
should
surely
get
good
seats
where
all
the
people
come
from
look
marion
said
eurie
what
would
harris
think
of
such
a
congregation
as
this
they
could
not
get
into
our
church
could
they
but
just
then
the
hymn
claimed
attention
my
days
are
gliding
swiftly
by
how
swiftly
these
days
had
glided
away
how
full
they
had
been
during
the
prayer
that
followed
all
heads
bowed
and
the
silence
that
fell
upon
them
made
it
seem
that
all
hearts
joined
vincent
was
the
first
speaker
his
manner
and
voice
had
changed
both
were
subdued
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
been
lifted
up
for
a
great
mental
strain
and
was
gradually
letting
down
again
to
earth
we
are
coming
toward
the
close
he
said
we
are
more
quiet
than
we
have
been
here
before
familiar
faces
and
forms
that
have
moved
in
and
out
among
these
trees
for
two
weeks
past
have
gone
only
a
few
hours
and
we
are
going
only
a
few
hours
and
utter
silence
will
fall
upon
chautauqua
oh
dear
murmured
eurie
why
he
be
so
forlorn
i
do
see
why
i
need
care
so
much
who
would
have
supposed
i
could
hush
said
marion
and
she
surreptitiously
wiped
away
a
tear
a
love
feast
vincent
said
they
were
going
to
have
for
that
last
evening
it
was
very
much
like
that
the
farewell
from
canada
came
next
the
speaker
said
he
had
been
thawed
out
meant
to
have
america
annexed
to
canada
indeed
they
had
already
been
annexed
in
heart
and
soul
who
said
he
and
what
what
who
knows
there
was
just
enough
of
the
comical
mixed
with
the
pathetic
in
this
address
to
steady
many
a
tremulous
heart
presbry
followed
in
much
the
same
strain
closing
though
with
such
a
tender
tribute
to
some
who
had
been
at
the
assembly
the
year
before
and
had
since
gone
to
join
the
assembly
that
never
breaks
up
that
the
tears
came
to
the
surface
again
but
those
blessed
tennesseeans
just
at
that
point
made
the
grounds
ring
with
the
chorus
oh
jubilee
jubilee
the
christian
religion
is
jubilee
and
followed
it
with
i
been
a
long
time
in
the
house
of
god
and
i
ai
got
weary
yet
by
that
time
our
girls
looked
at
each
other
with
faces
on
which
tears
and
smiles
struggled
for
the
mastery
shall
we
laugh
or
cry
whispered
eurie
and
then
they
giggled
outright
but
they
sobered
instantly
and
sat
upright
ready
to
listen
for
the
next
one
who
appeared
on
the
platform
was
deems
he
too
commenced
as
if
the
spell
of
the
parting
was
upon
him
he
was
too
tired
he
said
to
make
a
short
speech
some
one
asked
walter
scott
why
he
did
put
a
certain
book
of
his
into
one
volume
instead
of
five
and
he
said
he
had
time
it
took
five
weeks
to
prepare
a
speech
three
minutes
long
and
then
he
warmed
and
grew
with
his
subject
until
the
beautiful
thoughts
fell
around
them
like
pearls
not
only
beautiful
but
searching
no
man
said
he
to
make
a
careless
speech
at
chautauqua
there
are
too
many
to
treasure
it
up
to
plant
it
again
of
course
he
knew
nothing
about
those
girls
and
how
much
seed
they
were
gathering
which
they
meant
to
plant
but
they
gathered
it
all
the
same
he
dropped
his
seeds
with
lavish
hand
this
was
one
that
took
root
in
marion
brain
and
heart
there
are
so
many
side
influences
that
are
unconscious
that
the
only
safe
way
for
one
to
do
is
to
let
no
part
of
himself
ravel
but
to
keep
himself
round
and
thorough
and
healthy
to
the
core
after
that
marion
pencil
on
which
i
have
to
depend
for
my
notes
gave
up
in
despair
i
keep
track
of
that
man
she
said
when
i
complained
there
was
no
more
use
to
try
than
there
would
be
to
count
these
apple
blossoms
for
it
was
this
spring
and
we
were
standing
in
an
apple
orchard
and
a
perfect
shower
of
the
white
things
came
fluttering
round
our
heads
but
after
he
down
a
little
as
she
called
it
she
tried
to
write
again
and
i
copy
this
brethren
this
meeting
will
convert
some
of
the
most
thoughtful
people
of
this
generation
men
who
come
here
not
knowing
by
personal
experience
the
power
of
this
thing
men
who
walk
thoughtfully
up
and
down
these
aisles
looking
on
will
say
are
scholars
here
there
are
men
of
genius
of
great
brain
power
there
are
men
and
women
here
of
every
variety
of
temperament
and
attainment
held
together
for
fourteen
days
by
one
common
bond
and
the
perseverance
the
solemnity
the
hilarity
the
freedom
the
naturalness
the
earnestness
of
this
meeting
will
so
impress
them
that
they
will
know
that
there
is
a
miracle
holding
us
a
supernatural
strength
may
i
give
you
one
word
more
of
gospel
invitation
come
go
with
us
you
who
do
not
understand
this
matter
for
yourselves
go
with
us
and
we
do
you
good
will
you
go
to
your
rooms
and
make
the
resolve
that
shall
write
your
names
in
god
book
of
life
the
recording
angel
has
a
trembling
hand
this
minute
waiting
for
your
answer
weary
one
young
and
yet
so
tired
come
come
come
now
marion
with
cheeks
burning
and
eyes
very
bright
and
earnest
looked
around
her
eurie
sat
next
to
her
she
seemed
unmoved
there
was
no
sign
of
tears
to
her
bright
eyes
but
she
was
looking
steadily
at
the
speaker
never
mind
marion
said
within
herself
and
there
came
to
her
an
eager
desire
to
begin
her
practice
to
do
something
what
if
it
were
utter
failure
would
the
fault
be
hers
following
the
sudden
leading
that
she
had
learned
no
better
than
to
call
she
said
in
a
quick
low
whisper
eurie
and
she
held
her
breath
for
the
answer
and
could
distinctly
feel
the
beating
of
her
own
heart
eurie
turned
great
gray
astonished
eyes
on
her
friend
and
said
in
a
firm
quiet
voice
i
have
i
settled
that
matter
on
saturday
have
you
and
then
those
two
girls
each
with
the
wonderful
surprise
ringing
music
in
her
heart
were
willing
to
have
that
meeting
over
chapter
xxxii
the
end
of
the
beginning
it
was
almost
over
deems
sat
down
amid
the
hush
of
hearts
and
all
the
people
seemed
to
feel
that
no
more
words
were
needed
yet
the
next
moment
they
greeted
frank
beard
with
joy
and
prepared
themselves
with
great
satisfaction
to
listen
to
what
he
had
to
say
frank
beard
was
one
of
chautauqua
favorites
people
had
not
the
least
idea
that
they
could
be
beguiled
into
laughter
hearts
were
too
tender
for
that
yet
you
should
have
heard
the
bursts
of
mirth
that
rang
there
for
the
next
five
minutes
frank
beard
was
so
quaint
so
original
so
innocent
in
his
originality
so
pure
and
even
in
his
fun
and
they
liked
him
so
much
that
every
heart
there
responded
to
his
mirth
the
roars
of
laughter
reached
as
high
as
the
music
had
done
but
a
little
while
before
yet
when
people
hearts
are
tender
and
full
it
is
strange
how
near
laughter
is
to
tears
just
a
sentence
from
the
same
lips
and
the
hush
fell
on
them
again
frank
beard
had
brought
his
heart
with
him
to
chautauqua
and
he
was
evidently
leaving
some
of
it
there
the
touching
little
story
of
his
dream
about
his
mother
brought
out
a
flutter
of
handkerchiefs
and
made
faces
and
when
he
simply
as
a
child
tenderly
as
a
man
trustfully
as
only
a
christian
can
said
his
farewell
and
told
of
his
joyful
hope
of
meeting
them
all
in
the
eternal
morning
absolute
stillness
settled
over
them
so
many
last
words
one
and
another
came
just
a
word
just
until
we
meet
again
maybe
here
next
year
maybe
there
where
are
never
heard
finally
came
vincent
his
strong
decided
voice
breaking
the
spell
and
helping
them
to
realize
that
they
ware
men
and
women
with
work
to
do
now
my
friends
he
said
we
really
go
home
it
is
hard
to
close
i
know
that
no
one
knows
it
better
we
closed
a
good
many
times
and
it
wo
closed
the
last
word
has
been
said
over
and
over
again
i
said
it
myself
some
time
ago
and
here
i
am
again
we
must
just
never
mind
the
closing
we
will
ring
a
hymn
and
go
away
and
next
year
we
will
begin
right
here
where
we
left
it
but
he
did
stop
and
no
one
wanted
him
to
his
voice
grew
tender
and
his
words
were
solemn
the
last
words
that
he
would
ever
speak
to
many
a
soul
within
sound
of
his
voice
it
could
not
be
otherwise
you
can
imagine
better
than
i
could
tell
you
what
vincent
message
would
be
at
such
a
time
as
that
breaking
into
it
came
the
shrill
sound
of
the
whistle
the
phillips
the
last
boat
for
the
night
was
giving
out
its
warning
the
chautauqua
bells
began
their
parting
peal
not
even
for
his
own
convenience
would
that
marvel
of
punctuality
have
the
bells
tarry
a
moment
behind
the
hour
appointed
our
girls
looked
at
each
other
and
made
signs
and
nodded
and
began
to
slip
quietly
out
they
had
arranged
to
spend
the
night
at
the
mayville
house
and
take
an
early
train
many
others
were
softly
and
reluctantly
moving
away
they
were
very
quiet
during
that
last
walk
down
to
the
wharf
glorious
moonlight
was
abroad
and
the
water
shone
like
a
sheet
of
silver
as
they
walked
the
evening
wind
brought
to
them
the
notes
of
the
last
song
which
the
throng
at
the
stand
were
singing
a
clear
ringing
yet
tender
farewell
it
floated
sweetly
down
to
them
growing
fainter
and
fainter
as
the
distance
lengthened
until
as
they
stepped
on
board
the
boat
they
lost
its
sound
there
were
many
people
going
the
same
way
but
there
was
little
talking
there
are
times
when
people
though
they
may
be
very
far
from
unhappiness
have
no
desire
to
talk
once
on
deck
marion
turned
and
clasped
both
of
eurie
hands
i
have
had
such
a
blessed
surprise
she
said
with
glowing
face
i
did
not
think
of
such
a
thing
o
eurie
why
did
you
tell
me
you
can
not
begin
to
be
as
surprised
as
i
am
eurie
said
i
thought
you
were
miles
away
from
such
a
thing
why
did
you
tell
ruth
and
flossy
were
leaning
over
watching
the
play
of
the
water
against
the
boat
side
what
about
those
two
eurie
said
nodding
her
head
toward
them
marion
sighed
ruth
is
very
far
from
understanding
anything
about
it
she
said
at
least
the
last
time
i
talked
with
her
she
knew
as
little
about
the
christian
life
as
the
veriest
heathen
so
far
at
least
as
personal
duty
was
concerned
when
was
that
why
a
week
ago
more
than
a
week
how
long
is
it
since
you
settled
this
question
for
yourself
since
yesterday
marion
said
blushing
and
laughing
eurie
you
would
do
for
a
and
i
have
been
on
this
side
since
saturday
eurie
answered
significantly
a
great
many
things
can
happen
in
a
week
at
this
point
ruth
turned
and
came
towards
them
she
looked
quiet
and
grave
it
is
a
year
is
it
since
we
stood
here
together
for
the
first
time
she
said
at
least
i
seem
to
have
had
a
year
of
life
and
experience
do
you
know
girls
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
thought
to
wait
until
we
reached
home
but
i
have
decided
that
i
will
not
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
not
told
you
before
marion
do
you
know
how
like
a
simpleton
i
talked
a
week
ago
last
saturday
night
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
was
a
fool
and
was
talking
about
that
of
which
i
knew
nothing
at
all
i
want
to
assure
you
that
there
is
a
safe
place
that
i
know
it
now
by
actual
experience
i
have
gone
to
the
mountain
and
it
is
sure
and
safe
and
oh
girls
i
want
you
both
to
come
so
much
i
know
the
mountain
marion
said
reaching
out
and
clasping
hand
the
name
of
it
is
calvary
it
safe
and
it
is
sufficient
for
us
all
ruthie
we
three
are
together
in
this
thing
what
those
girls
said
to
each
other
then
and
there
is
sacred
to
them
but
if
i
could
i
would
tell
you
something
of
the
joy
they
felt
flossy
still
leaned
over
the
railing
a
small
quiet
speck
in
the
moonlight
marion
kept
turning
her
head
in
her
direction
our
poor
little
flossy
would
not
understand
much
about
this
experience
i
suppose
she
said
at
last
she
is
such
a
child
and
yet
i
know
sometimes
i
have
fancied
that
she
thinks
more
than
we
give
her
credit
for
that
at
least
she
has
lately
let
us
tell
her
anyway
eurie
said
we
ca
know
what
good
it
may
do
if
we
had
not
been
so
dreadfully
afraid
of
each
other
during
the
last
few
days
we
might
have
helped
each
other
a
good
deal
for
my
part
i
have
learned
a
lesson
on
which
i
mean
to
practice
ruth
looked
up
quickly
a
rare
smile
in
her
eyes
she
opened
her
lips
to
speak
to
them
then
seemed
to
change
her
mind
and
raised
her
voice
flossy
and
flossy
came
at
her
call
come
here
ruth
said
withdrawing
her
hand
from
marion
and
winding
her
arm
around
the
small
figure
beside
her
flossy
the
girls
have
had
our
very
experience
all
by
themselves
and
they
want
to
know
how
long
it
is
since
you
began
to
think
about
this
matter
for
yourself
flossy
turned
her
soft
blue
eyes
on
marion
the
very
night
we
came
marion
and
you
made
me
come
to
the
meeting
in
the
rain
you
remember
i
heard
that
which
i
knew
would
never
let
me
rest
again
until
i
understood
it
and
had
it
for
my
own
but
i
was
very
ignorant
and
foolish
and
i
blundered
along
in
the
dark
for
three
mortal
days
after
that
jesus
found
me
and
i
have
known
since
what
it
is
to
live
in
the
light
a
christian
experience
of
ten
whole
days
eurie
said
of
course
she
was
the
first
one
to
rise
from
her
surprise
and
get
possession
of
her
tongue
flossy
you
have
had
a
chance
to
get
a
good
way
ahead
instead
of
being
behind
as
we
thought
you
will
have
to
show
us
the
way
is
this
just
wonderful
broke
forth
marion
suddenly
an
overwhelming
sense
coming
over
her
of
the
new
relations
that
they
four
would
henceforth
bear
to
each
other
why
girls
what
would
they
say
up
there
at
the
stand
if
they
could
know
what
has
come
to
each
of
us
i
almost
feel
like
going
back
and
telling
them
all
just
think
what
a
delight
it
would
be
to
vincent
and
deems
and
oh
to
all
of
them
is
it
queer
to
think
how
well
we
know
them
all
and
they
are
not
aware
of
our
existence
i
do
believe
people
will
have
to
wait
to
be
introduced
to
each
other
when
they
get
to
heaven
eurie
said
that
is
one
of
the
first
things
i
am
going
to
do
when
i
get
there
hunt
up
some
of
these
chautauqua
people
and
cultivate
their
acquaintance
this
sentence
gave
flossy
a
new
thought
we
are
really
going
to
heaven
she
said
it
precisely
as
you
might
speak
of
a
trip
to
europe
on
which
your
heart
had
long
been
set
we
are
just
as
sure
of
it
as
though
we
were
there
this
minute
girls
do
you
know
how
nice
we
thought
it
would
be
to
be
together
at
chautauqua
for
two
whole
weeks
now
think
of
being
together
there
for
a
million
years
but
the
thought
which
filled
flossy
heart
with
a
sweet
song
of
melody
and
wreathed
her
face
in
glad
smiles
was
such
an
overwhelming
one
to
marion
so
immense
with
power
and
possibility
that
it
seemed
to
her
to
take
her
very
breath
she
turned
abruptly
from
the
rest
and
walked
to
the
teasel
side
to
still
the
throbbing
of
her
heart
meantime
the
boat
had
been
filling
with
passengers
and
now
she
was
getting
under
way
still
the
hush
continued
the
people
stood
closely
around
the
railing
on
the
chautauqua
side
and
looked
lovingly
back
at
the
fair
point
of
land
that
lay
before
them
in
glowing
moonlight
presently
a
leading
voice
began
to
sing
there
a
land
that
is
fairer
than
day
and
by
faith
we
can
see
it
afar
for
the
father
waits
over
the
way
to
prepare
us
a
there
we
shall
meet
in
the
sweet
by
and
by
on
that
beautiful
shore
in
the
sweet
by
and
by
we
shall
meet
on
that
beautiful
shore
before
the
chorus
was
reached
every
voice
that
could
sing
at
all
must
have
taken
up
the
strain
marion
for
the
first
time
in
years
gave
a
hint
of
the
full
compass
of
her
powers
making
ruth
turn
suddenly
towards
her
with
a
brightening
face
for
she
saw
how
the
singing
and
the
playing
could
fit
into
each
other
and
do
good
service
on
and
on
stole
the
vessel
through
the
silver
water
the
courteous
captain
came
around
quietly
for
his
tickets
and
to
one
and
another
with
whose
faces
he
had
grown
familiar
he
said
we
shall
miss
you
the
phillips
has
been
proud
of
carrying
you
all
safely
back
and
forth
one
said
to
him
in
return
i
hope
captain
we
shall
all
land
at
last
safe
in
the
harbor
and
the
captain
bowed
his
answer
in
silence
it
would
have
been
hard
to
speak
words
just
then
but
ever
and
anon
that
leading
voice
took
up
words
of
song
still
the
song
that
best
seemed
to
suit
all
hearts
was
that
tender
by
and
by
and
as
the
lights
along
the
chautauqua
shore
grew
dim
it
rose
again
in
swelling
volume
we
shall
meet
we
shall
sing
we
shall
reign
in
the
land
where
the
saved
never
die
we
shall
rest
free
from
sorrow
and
pain
safe
at
home
in
the
sweet
by
and
by
then
the
refrain
repeated
and
until
as
the
last
lingering
note
of
it
died
away
the
boat
touched
at
the
wharf
and
looking
back
they
saw
that
the
chautauqua
lights
were
out
and
silence
and
darkness
had
fairpoint
marion
said
and
she
bowed
towards
the
distant
shore
she
was
smiling
but
her
lips
were
quivering
we
shall
meet
in
the
sweet
by
and
by
flossy
quoted
but
her
voice
trembled
there
is
a
chance
to
do
grand
work
first
that
the
final
meeting
may
be
infinitely
larger
because
of
us
this
the
leading
voice
in
the
singing
said
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
say
and
as
they
took
it
some
of
the
girls
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
it
was
roberts
as
for
flossy
she
had
known
it
all
the
time
we
are
going
to
try
to
do
some
of
the
work
roberts
eurie
said
i
have
found
the
road
to
bethany
since
i
saw
you
the
road
and
we
are
going
to
try
and
keep
it
well
trodden
he
was
shaking
hands
with
flossy
as
eurie
spoke
and
he
still
held
her
hand
while
he
answered
good
news
there
is
plenty
of
work
to
do
it
is
well
that
chautauqua
has
gathered
in
new
reapers
i
am
coming
to
your
city
next
winter

shall
want
to
help
you
