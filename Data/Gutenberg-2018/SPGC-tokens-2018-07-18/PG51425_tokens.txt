preface
i
hasten
to
protest
at
the
outset
that
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
the
incorrigible
who
wrote
this
amazing
book
if
he
is
to
be
encouraged
and
approved
then
british
morality
is
a
mockery
british
respectability
an
imposture
and
british
industry
a
vice
perhaps
they
are
i
have
always
kept
an
open
mind
on
the
subject
but
still
one
may
ask
some
better
ground
for
pitching
them
out
of
window
than
the
caprice
of
a
tramp
i
hope
these
expressions
will
not
excite
unreasonable
expectations
of
a
thrilling
realistic
romance
or
a
scandalous
chronicle
to
follow
davies
autobiography
is
not
a
bit
sensational
it
might
be
the
post
office
directory
for
the
matter
of
that
a
less
simple
minded
supertramp
would
not
have
thought
it
worth
writing
at
all
for
it
mentions
nothing
that
might
not
have
happened
to
any
of
us
as
to
scandal
i
though
a
most
respectable
author
have
never
written
half
so
proper
a
book
these
pudent
pages
are
unstained
with
the
frightful
language
the
debased
dialect
of
the
fictitious
proletarians
of
rudyard
kipling
and
other
genteel
writers
in
them
the
patrons
of
the
casual
ward
and
the
dosshouse
argue
with
the
decorum
of
socrates
and
narrate
in
the
style
of
tacitus
they
have
that
pleasant
combination
of
childish
freshness
with
scrupulous
literary
conscientiousness
only
possible
to
people
for
whom
speech
spoken
or
written
but
especially
written
is
still
a
feat
to
be
admired
and
shewn
off
for
its
own
sake
not
for
the
life
of
me
could
i
capture
that
boyish
charm
and
combine
it
with
the
of
an
experienced
man
of
the
world
much
less
of
an
experienced
tramp
the
innocence
of
the
author
manner
and
the
perfection
of
his
delicacy
is
such
that
you
might
read
his
book
aloud
in
an
almshouse
without
shocking
the
squeamishness
of
old
age
as
for
the
young
nothing
shocks
the
young
the
immorality
of
the
matter
is
stupendous
but
it
is
purely
an
industrial
immorality
as
to
the
sort
of
immorality
that
is
most
dreaded
by
schoolmistresses
and
duennas
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
book
to
suggest
that
tramps
know
even
what
it
means
on
the
contrary
i
can
quite
believe
that
the
author
would
die
of
shame
if
he
were
asked
to
write
such
books
as
adam
bede
or
david
copperfield
the
manuscript
came
into
my
hands
under
the
following
circumstances
in
the
year
i
received
by
post
a
volume
of
poems
by
one
william
davies
whose
address
was
the
farm
house
kennington
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
there
was
still
a
farmhouse
left
in
kennington
for
i
did
not
then
suspect
that
the
farmhouse
like
the
shepherdess
walks
and
nightingale
lanes
and
whetstone
parks
of
bethnal
green
and
holborn
is
so
called
nowadays
in
irony
and
is
in
fact
a
dosshouse
or
hostelry
where
single
men
can
have
a
night
lodging
for
at
most
sixpence
i
was
not
surprised
at
getting
the
poems
i
get
a
gift
of
minor
poetry
once
a
week
or
so
and
yet
hardened
as
i
am
to
it
i
still
knowing
how
much
these
little
books
mean
to
their
authors
can
seldom
throw
them
aside
without
a
twinge
of
compunction
which
i
allay
by
a
glance
at
one
of
the
pages
in
the
faint
but
inextinguishable
hope
of
finding
something
valuable
there
sometimes
a
letter
accompanies
the
book
and
then
i
get
a
rapid
impression
from
the
handwriting
and
notepaper
as
well
as
from
the
binding
and
type
in
the
book
or
even
from
the
reputation
of
the
publisher
of
the
class
and
type
of
the
author
thus
i
guess
cambridge
or
oxford
or
maida
vale
or
west
kensington
or
exeter
or
the
lakes
or
the
east
coast
or
a
newdigate
prizeman
a
romantic
jew
a
maiden
lady
a
shy
country
parson
or
whom
not
what
not
where
not
when
davies
book
came
to
hand
my
imagination
failed
me
i
could
not
place
him
there
were
no
author
compliments
no
publisher
compliments
indeed
no
publisher
in
the
ordinary
channel
of
the
trade
in
minor
poetry
the
author
as
far
as
i
could
guess
had
walked
into
a
printer
or
stationer
shop
handed
in
his
manuscript
and
ordered
his
book
as
he
might
have
ordered
a
pair
of
boots
it
was
marked
price
half
a
crown
an
accompanying
letter
asked
me
very
civilly
if
i
required
a
book
of
verses
and
if
so
would
i
please
send
the
author
the
half
crown
if
not
would
i
return
the
book
this
was
attractively
simple
and
sensible
further
the
handwriting
was
remarkably
delicate
and
individual
the
sort
of
handwriting
one
might
expect
from
shelley
or
george
meredith
i
opened
the
book
and
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
for
before
i
had
read
three
lines
i
perceived
that
the
author
was
a
real
poet
his
work
was
not
in
the
least
strenuous
or
modern
there
was
in
it
no
sign
that
he
had
ever
read
anything
later
than
cowper
or
crabbe
not
even
byron
shelley
or
keats
much
less
morris
swinburne
tennyson
or
henley
and
kipling
there
was
indeed
no
sign
of
his
ever
having
read
anything
otherwise
than
as
a
child
reads
the
result
was
a
freedom
from
literary
vulgarity
which
was
like
a
draught
of
clear
water
in
a
desert
here
i
saw
was
a
genuine
innocent
writing
odds
and
ends
of
verse
about
odds
and
ends
of
things
living
quite
out
of
the
world
in
which
such
things
are
usually
done
and
knowing
no
better
or
rather
no
worse
than
to
get
his
book
made
by
the
appropriate
craftsman
and
hawk
it
round
like
any
other
ware
evidently
then
a
poor
man
it
horrified
me
to
think
of
a
poor
man
spending
his
savings
in
printing
something
that
nobody
buys
poetry
to
wit
i
thought
of
browning
threatening
to
leave
the
country
when
the
surveyor
of
taxes
fantastically
assessed
him
for
an
imaginary
income
derived
from
his
poems
i
thought
of
morris
who
even
after
the
earthly
paradise
estimated
his
income
as
a
poet
at
a
hundred
a
year
i
saw
that
this
man
might
well
be
simple
enough
to
suppose
that
he
could
go
into
the
verse
business
and
make
a
living
at
it
as
one
makes
a
living
by
auctioneering
or
shopkeeping
so
instead
of
throwing
the
book
away
as
i
have
thrown
so
many
i
wrote
him
a
letter
telling
him
that
he
could
not
live
by
poetry
also
i
bought
some
spare
copies
and
told
him
to
send
them
to
such
critics
and
verse
fanciers
as
he
knew
of
wondering
whether
they
would
recognise
a
poet
when
they
met
one
and
they
actually
did
i
presently
saw
in
a
london
newspaper
an
enthusiastic
notice
of
the
poems
and
an
account
of
an
interview
with
the
author
from
which
i
learnt
that
he
was
a
tramp
that
the
farm
house
was
a
dosshouse
and
that
he
was
cut
off
from
ordinary
industrial
pursuits
by
two
circumstances
first
that
he
had
mislaid
one
of
his
feet
somewhere
on
his
trampings
and
now
had
to
make
shift
as
best
he
could
with
the
other
second
that
he
was
a
man
of
independent
means
a
in
short
a
gentleman
the
exact
amount
of
his
independent
income
was
ten
shillings
a
week
finding
this
too
much
for
his
needs
he
devoted
twenty
per
cent
of
it
to
pensioning
necessitous
friends
in
his
native
place
saved
a
further
percentage
to
print
verses
with
and
lived
modestly
on
the
remainder
my
purchase
of
eight
copies
of
the
book
enabled
him
i
gathered
to
discard
all
economy
for
about
three
months
it
also
moved
him
to
offer
me
the
privilege
for
such
i
quite
sincerely
deem
it
of
reading
his
autobiography
in
manuscript
the
following
pages
will
enable
the
world
at
large
to
read
it
in
print
all
i
have
to
say
by
way
of
recommendation
of
the
book
is
that
i
have
read
it
through
from
beginning
to
end
and
would
have
read
more
of
it
had
there
been
any
more
to
read
it
is
a
placid
narrative
unexciting
in
matter
and
unvarnished
in
manner
of
the
commonplaces
of
a
life
it
is
of
a
very
curious
quality
were
not
the
author
an
approved
poet
of
remarkable
sensibility
and
delicacy
i
should
put
down
the
extraordinary
quietness
of
his
narrative
to
a
monstrous
callousness
even
as
it
is
i
ask
myself
with
some
indignation
whether
a
man
should
lose
a
limb
with
no
more
than
a
lobster
loses
a
claw
or
a
lizard
his
tail
as
if
he
could
grow
a
new
one
at
his
next
halting
place
if
such
a
thing
happened
to
me
i
should
begin
the
chapter
describing
it
with
i
now
come
to
the
event
which
altered
the
whole
course
of
my
life
and
blighted
etc
in
davies
pages
the
thing
happens
as
unexpectedly
as
it
did
in
real
life
and
with
an
effect
on
the
reader
as
appalling
as
if
he
were
an
actual
spectator
fortunately
it
only
happened
once
half
a
dozen
such
shocks
would
make
any
book
unbearable
by
a
sensitive
soul
i
do
not
know
whether
i
should
describe
our
supertramp
as
a
lucky
man
or
an
unlucky
one
in
making
him
a
poet
fortune
gave
him
her
supremest
gift
but
such
high
gifts
are
hardly
personal
assets
they
are
often
terrible
destinies
and
crushing
burdens
also
he
chanced
upon
an
independent
income
enough
to
give
him
reasonable
courage
and
not
enough
to
bring
him
under
the
hoof
of
suburban
convention
lure
him
into
a
premature
marriage
or
deliver
him
into
the
hands
of
the
doctors
still
not
quite
enough
to
keep
his
teeth
in
proper
repair
and
his
feet
dry
in
all
weathers
some
flat
bad
luck
he
has
had
i
suppose
every
imaginative
boy
is
a
criminal
stealing
and
destroying
for
the
sake
of
being
great
in
the
sense
in
which
greatness
is
presented
to
him
in
the
romance
of
history
but
very
few
get
caught
davies
unfortunately
was
seized
by
the
police
haled
before
the
magistrate
and
made
to
expiate
by
stripes
the
bygone
crimes
of
myself
and
some
millions
of
other
respectable
citizens
that
was
hard
luck
certainly
it
gives
me
a
feeling
of
moral
superiority
to
him
for
i
never
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
police
at
least
they
did
not
go
on
with
the
case
one
of
incendiarism
because
the
gentleman
whose
property
i
burnt
had
a
strong
sense
of
humour
and
a
kindly
nature
and
let
me
off
when
i
made
him
a
precocious
speech
the
first
i
ever
delivered
on
the
thoughtlessness
of
youth
it
is
remarkable
what
a
difference
it
makes
this
matter
of
the
police
though
it
is
obviously
quite
beside
the
ethical
question
davies
tells
us
with
his
inimitable
quiet
modesty
that
he
begged
stole
and
drank
now
i
have
begged
and
stolen
and
if
i
never
drank
that
was
only
an
application
of
the
principle
of
division
of
labour
to
the
shaw
clan
for
several
members
of
it
drank
enough
for
ten
but
i
have
always
managed
to
keep
out
of
the
casual
ward
and
the
police
court
and
this
gives
me
an
ineffable
sense
of
superior
respectability
when
i
read
the
deplorable
confessions
of
davies
who
is
a
true
poet
in
his
disregard
for
appearances
and
is
quite
at
home
in
tramp
wards
another
effect
of
this
book
on
me
is
to
make
me
realise
what
a
slave
of
convention
i
have
been
all
my
life
when
i
think
of
the
way
i
worked
tamely
for
my
living
during
all
those
years
when
davies
a
free
knight
of
the
highway
lived
like
a
pet
bird
on
titbits
i
feel
that
i
have
been
duped
out
of
my
natural
liberty
why
had
i
not
the
luck
at
the
outset
of
my
career
to
meet
that
tramp
who
came
to
davies
like
evangelist
to
christian
on
the
first
day
of
his
american
pilgrim
progress
and
saved
him
on
the
very
brink
of
looking
for
a
job
by
bidding
him
to
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
to
ask
and
it
should
be
given
to
him
to
knock
and
it
should
be
opened
to
him
and
to
free
himself
from
the
middle
class
assumption
that
only
through
taking
a
ticket
can
one
take
a
train
let
every
youth
into
whose
hands
this
book
falls
ponder
its
lesson
well
and
when
next
his
parents
and
guardians
attempt
to
drive
him
into
some
inhuman
imprisonment
and
drudgery
under
the
pretext
that
he
should
earn
his
own
living
think
of
the
hospitable
countrysides
of
america
with
their
overflowing
with
milk
and
honey
for
the
tramp
and
their
offers
of
adoption
for
every
day
labourer
with
a
dash
of
poetry
in
him
and
then
how
much
did
i
know
about
hotels
until
i
read
this
book
i
have
often
wondered
how
the
poor
travel
for
it
is
plain
that
the
ritzes
and
metropoles
and
even
the
hotels
noted
by
baedeker
as
unpretending
are
not
for
them
where
does
the
man
with
sixpence
in
his
pocket
stay
davies
knows
read
and
learn
it
is
to
be
noted
that
davies
is
no
propagandist
of
the
illusions
of
the
tramp
fancier
you
never
suspect
him
of
having
read
lavengro
or
got
his
notions
of
nomads
from
theodore
watts
dunton
he
does
not
tell
you
that
there
is
honour
among
tramps
on
the
contrary
he
makes
it
clear
that
only
by
being
too
destitute
to
be
worth
robbing
and
murdering
can
a
tramp
insure
himself
against
being
robbed
and
murdered
by
his
comrade
of
the
road
the
tramp
is
fastidious
and
accomplished
audacious
and
but
he
is
free
from
divine
exploitation
he
has
no
orbit
he
has
the
endless
trouble
of
doing
what
he
likes
with
himself
and
the
endless
discountenance
of
being
passed
by
as
useless
by
the
life
force
that
finds
superselfish
work
for
other
men
that
i
suppose
is
why
davies
tramps
no
more
but
writes
verses
and
saves
money
to
print
them
out
of
eight
shillings
a
week
and
this
too
at
a
moment
when
the
loss
of
a
limb
has
placed
within
his
reach
such
success
in
begging
as
he
had
never
before
dared
to
dream
of
davies
is
now
a
poet
of
established
reputation
he
no
longer
prints
his
verses
and
hawks
them
he
is
regularly
published
and
reviewed
whether
he
finds
the
change
a
lucrative
one
i
venture
to
doubt
that
the
verses
in
the
soul
destroyer
and
in
his
new
poems
will
live
is
beyond
question
but
whether
davies
can
live
if
anything
happens
to
his
eight
shillings
a
week
unless
he
takes
to
the
road
again
is
another
matter
that
is
perhaps
why
he
has
advised
himself
to
write
and
print
his
autobiography
and
try
his
luck
with
it
as
man
of
letters
in
a
more
general
sense
though
it
is
only
in
verse
that
he
writes
exquisitely
yet
this
book
which
is
printed
as
it
was
written
without
any
academic
corrections
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
perfect
commercial
letter
writer
is
worth
reading
by
literary
experts
for
its
style
alone
and
since
his
manner
is
so
quiet
it
has
been
thought
well
by
his
friends
and
his
publishers
to
send
a
trumpeter
before
him
the

the
autobiography
of
a
the
autobiography
of
a
chapter
i
childhood
i
was
born
years
ago
in
a
public
house
called
the
church
house
in
the
town
of
n
in
the
county
of
m
it
was
kept
by
my
grandfather
native
of
cornwall
a
retired
sea
captain
whose
pride
it
was
drunk
or
sober
to
inform
all
strangers
that
he
had
been
master
of
his
own
ship
the
said
ship
being
a
small
schooner
in
those
days
there
was
a
steam
packet
called
the
trading
regularly
between
n
and
bristol
and
in
the
latter
town
we
had
relatives
on
my
grandmother
side
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
my
grandmother
belonged
to
somerset
and
she
often
paid
a
visit
to
three
maiden
sisters
first
cousins
of
hers
living
i
believe
near
glastonbury
who
had
a
young
relative
that
had
gone
on
the
stage
and
was
causing
some
stir
under
a
different
name
from
his
own
which
was
brodrib
my
grandmother
held
very
strong
opinions
about
the
stage
and
when
these
first
cousins
met
no
doubt
the
young
man
in
those
early
days
was
most
severely
discussed
and
had
he
not
been
a
blood
relation
would
have
been
considered
a
sinner
too
far
advanced
for
prayer
my
earliest
recollection
is
of
being
taken
as
a
small
boy
with
an
elder
brother
to
bristol
on
the
by
my
grandfather
i
believe
the
frequency
of
these
trips
was
mainly
owing
to
the
friendship
existing
between
the
two
captains
as
my
grandfather
seldom
left
the
bridge
taking
a
practical
part
in
the
navigation
of
the
ship
and
channel
except
at
times
to
visit
the
saloon
cabin
for
a
little
refreshment
on
one
trip
we
had
a
very
stormy
passage
and
on
that
occasion
the
winds
and
the
waves
made
such
a
fool
of
the
that
she
to
use
the
feminine
gender
as
is
the
custom
of
every
true
mariner
of
one
of
whom
i
am
a
proud
descendant
often
threatened
to
dive
into
the
bowels
of
the
deep
for
peace
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
my
grandfather
assisted
the
captain
of
the
to
such
purpose
that
people
aboard
acclaimed
him
as
the
saviour
of
their
lives
and
blessed
him
for
the
safety
of
the
ship
it
is
not
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
when
the
old
man
ashore
returning
at
midnight
from
this
rough
voyage
with
me
and
my
brother
would
frequently
pause
and
startle
the
silent
hour
with
a
stentorian
voice
addressed
to
indifferent
sleepers
do
you
know
who
i
am
captain
davies
master
of
his
own
ship
whether
the
police
were
awed
by
this
announcement
or
knew
him
to
be
an
honest
respectable
man
with
a
few
idiosyncrasies
i
can
not
say
but
it
was
apparent
to
me
in
those
young
days
that
they
assisted
him
home
with
much
gentleness
and
he
was
passed
on
carefully
from
beat
to
beat
as
though
he
were
a
case
of
new
laid
eggs
alas
the
became
childish
in
her
old
age
she
would
often
loiter
so
long
in
the
channel
as
to
deceive
the
tide
that
expected
her
and
to
disappoint
a
hundred
people
who
assembled
on
the
bridge
under
which
she
moored
to
welcome
her
what
with
her
missing
of
tides
her
wandering
into
strange
courses
her
sudden
appearance
in
the
river
after
rumours
of
loss
her
name
soon
became
the
common
talk
of
the
town
her
erratic
behaviour
became
at
last
so
usual
that
people
lost
all
interest
as
to
her
whereabouts
or
whither
she
had
wandered
and
were
contented
to
know
that
she
arrived
safe
though
late
they
were
not
curious
to
know
if
she
had
been
dozing
in
a
fog
or
had
rested
for
a
day
or
two
on
a
bank
of
mud
whatever
she
had
done
she
had
been
too
wary
to
collide
and
being
too
slow
to
dash
through
the
waves
had
allowed
them
to
roll
her
over
with
very
little
power
of
resistance
these
things
happened
until
she
was
condemned
and
sold
and
her
mooring
place
to
this
day
is
unoccupied
by
a
successor
when
i
now
cross
the
bridge
and
look
down
on
her
accustomed
place
i
think
with
tender
emotion
of
the
past
after
the
had
been
deposed
in
her
old
age
accused
of
disobeying
captain
and
crew
charged
with
being
indifferent
to
her
duties
and
forgetful
of
her
responsibilities
her
captain
losing
his
beloved
ship
idled
a
few
months
ashore
and
died
no
doubt
he
had
grown
to
love
her
but
she
had
gone
beyond
the
control
of
living
man
and
a
score
of
the
best
seamen
breathing
could
not
have
made
her
punctual
to
her
duties
therefore
he
could
not
reasonably
answer
the
charges
made
against
her
some
other
company
it
was
rumoured
had
chartered
her
for
the
mediterranean
which
would
certainly
be
much
better
for
her
time
of
life
the
mediterranean
being
so
large
a
body
of
water
as
compared
with
the
bristol
channel
would
allow
her
more
scope
for
manoeuvres
but
all
this
was
idle
talk
probably
a
profane
sneer
at
her
old
age
for
it
was
told
me
by
an
that
she
was
run
ashore
in
an
isolated
pool
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
stripped
unceremoniously
of
her
iron
and
her
burned
it
is
only
a
few
years
ago
since
the
river
was
hers
but
her
name
is
seldom
mentioned
at
the
present
day
it
was
through
being
born
in
a
public
house
that
i
became
acquainted
with
the
taste
of
drink
at
a
very
early
age
receiving
sups
of
mulled
beer
at
bed
time
in
lieu
of
cocoa
or
tea
as
is
the
custom
in
more
domestic
houses
so
that
after
my
school
days
were
over
i
required
but
very
little
inducement
to
drink
at
last
the
old
people
being
tired
of
business
and
having
a
little
property
retired
into
private
life
my
father
whom
i
can
not
remember
being
dead
and
my
mother
marrying
the
second
time
much
to
the
old
folks
annoyance
their
own
children
having
all
died
they
kindly
offered
to
adopt
us
three
children
the
only
grandchildren
they
had
and
mother
knowing
that
such
would
be
to
our
future
benefit
at
once
agreed
when
we
were
settled
in
private
life
our
home
consisted
of
grandfather
grandmother
an
imbecile
brother
a
sister
myself
a
maidservant
a
dog
a
cat
a
parrot
a
dove
and
a
canary
bird
i
remember
those
happy
days
and
often
wish
i
could
speak
into
the
ears
of
the
dead
the
gratitude
which
was
due
to
them
in
life
and
so
ill
returned
my
school
days
began
but
i
played
truant
day
after
day
and
the
maidservant
had
to
lead
me
as
a
prisoner
to
school
although
small
of
figure
i
was
a
good
athlete
and
so
often
fighting
that
some
of
my
relatives
thought
that
prize
fighting
was
of
a
certainty
to
be
my
future
vocation
mother
father
and
brothers
all
took
great
interest
in
pugilism
and
they
knew
the
game
well
from
much
practice
of
their
own
they
were
never
so
much
delighted
as
when
i
visited
them
with
a
black
eye
or
a
bloody
nose
at
which
time
they
would
be
at
the
trouble
to
give
cunning
points
as
to
how
to
meet
an
opponent
according
to
his
weight
and
height
he
certainly
has
the
one
thing
essential
they
affirm
one
to
the
other
and
that
is
the
heart
without
that
experience
would
be
of
no
account
but
with
that
it
will
be
the
making
of
him
if
i
took
off
my
coat
to
battle
in
the
streets
the
shirt
itself
came
off
in
the
lanes
and
fields
when
attending
school
i
would
accompany
a
dozen
or
more
boys
following
the
leader
needless
to
say
i
was
the
leader
and
being
a
good
jumper
would
leap
over
ditches
that
would
try
every
nerve
in
my
body
two
or
three
would
follow
a
little
less
successfully
and
then
we
would
bully
and
threaten
the
less
active
to
make
the
attempt
often
we
had
to
drag
them
out
by
the
hair
of
the
head
and
it
was
in
this
condition
that
they
were
led
back
to
school
late
always
late
the
dirtiest
boy
who
had
had
the
most
pressure
put
upon
him
and
was
truly
the
most
gentle
and
least
guilty
of
us
all
would
be
punished
the
most
severely
for
these
escapades
owing
to
his
dirtier
condition
and
most
likely
receive
more
punishment
afterwards
at
home
strange
that
i
was
not
a
bad
scholar
and
that
i
passed
all
my
standards
with
ease
in
the
last
year
of
my
school
days
i
became
captain
of
the
school
football
team
and
was
honoured
and
trusted
by
being
allowed
to
take
charge
of
the
ball
but
owing
to
making
private
use
of
the
same
and
practising
in
secret
with
boys
of
other
schools
i
was
requested
by
the
committee
to
forfeit
my
trust
although
i
might
still
continue
captain
as
aforesaid
if
i
had
been
contented
with
these
innocent
honours
and
had
not
been
so
ambitious
to
excel
in
other
and
more
infamous
parts
all
would
have
been
well
and
my
schooldays
would
have
been
something
of
a
credit
to
me
but
unfortunately
at
this
time
i
organised
a
band
of
robbers
six
in
number
and
all
of
good
families
and
comfortable
homes
it
was
our
wont
to
enter
busy
stores
knowing
that
small
boys
would
not
be
attended
to
until
the
grown
people
had
finished
their
purchases
then
we
would
slyly
take
things
up
for
a
curious
examination
at
the
same
time
watching
a
favourable
opportunity
to
surreptitiously
appropriate
them
when
accosted
by
the
shopman
as
to
our
wants
we
would
innocently
ask
the
price
of
some
article
we
had
agreed
on
and
receiving
answer
would
quietly
leave
the
premises
this
went
on
for
some
time
and
i
had
nefariously
profited
by
a
large
assortment
of
miscellaneous
articles
such
as
paints
brushes
books
bottles
of
scent
and
various
other
items
that
could
not
be
preserved
such
as
sweets
and
confectionery
how
this
continued
for
six
weeks
speaks
well
for
our
well
laid
plans
and
our
dexterity
in
the
performance
of
them
my
girl
maggie
who
had
during
our
early
acquaintance
received
only
presents
of
wild
flowers
and
birds
eggs
and
occasionally
a
handful
of
nuts
was
now
the
happy
possessor
of
valuable
presents
in
the
shape
of
purses
pocket
books
bottles
of
scents
pencils
of
silver
not
to
mention
having
received
a
hundred
different
sorts
of
sweets
and
cake
that
was
superior
to
her
mother
time
after
time
she
promised
not
to
betray
me
or
any
of
my
confederates
the
latter
often
warned
me
against
reposing
confidence
in
the
other
sex
one
produced
a
book
at
that
very
moment
which
told
how
a
woman
betrayed
a
gang
of
robbers
and
it
was
his
firm
opinion
that
the
other
sex
could
not
be
trusted
farther
than
they
could
be
seen
at
home
i
was
cured
of
thieving
by
what
i
thought
at
that
time
to
be
a
very
remarkable
incident
no
more
or
less
than
the
result
of
witchcraft
one
day
my
grandmother
happened
to
be
standing
before
the
fire
cooking
and
above
the
fireplace
was
a
large
mirror
towards
which
her
eyes
were
turned
thinking
this
a
favourable
opportunity
to
rifle
the
sugar
basin
i
lost
no
time
in
making
the
attempt
but
my
fingers
had
scarcely
closed
on
a
large
lump
when
the
old
lady
without
in
the
least
turning
her
head
cried
in
a
shrill
voice
you
dare
for
my
life
i
could
not
account
for
this
discovery
and
it
sent
such
a
shock
through
me
that
i
never
again
attempted
in
the
old
presence
to
be
other
than
honest
she
could
close
her
eyes
in
the
arm
chair
and
even
breathe
audibly
but
i
never
had
the
confidence
to
make
another
attempt
but
this
incident
at
home
had
no
detrimental
effect
on
my
courage
abroad
one
day
i
and
my
lieutenant
played
truant
from
school
and
making
our
way
up
town
began
to
execute
various
little
plans
that
had
been
concocted
the
night
before
after
several
desperate
sorties
on
confectionery
with
our
usual
success
we
began
to
meditate
on
higher
game
we
blundered
at
a
cigar
case
in
a
chemist
shop
and
had
to
leave
our
spoils
behind
although
fearful
we
entered
a
large
grocery
store
and
were
having
great
success
when
my
lieutenant
dropped
a
bottle
of
scent
and
not
having
the
presence
of
mind
to
stand
his
ground
and
make
it
appear
an
accident
made
a
guilty
rush
through
the
open
door
i
followed
him
at
once
and
catching
him
up
got
clear
ahead
but
the
hue
and
cry
was
out
and
every
one
shouted
stop
thieves
this
terrible
cry
taken
up
by
one
and
another
took
all
the
strength
out
of
our
legs
and
our
own
sheer
terror
brought
us
to
a
halt
in
five
minutes
we
were
captured
and
crying
over
our
ill
luck
in
a
prison
cell
we
made
a
confession
of
everything
and
the
rest
of
the
gang
were
soon
under
arrest
our
houses
were
visited
by
detectives
and
searched
and
different
articles
found
in
cupboards
drawers
desks
and
chests
which
were
soon
identified
by
the
shopkeepers
maggie
at
the
instigation
of
her
mother
gave
several
articles
to
the
police
with
information
proving
to
me
even
in
those
early
days
how
little
her
sex
was
to
be
trusted
the
unfortunate
part
of
this
was
that
we
all
had
good
homes
my
grandfather
would
most
certainly
have
paid
a
fine
of
twenty
or
thirty
pounds
to
save
me
from
punishment
and
offered
i
believe
to
do
the
same
alas
the
magistrates
were
inexorable
and
i
and
my
lieutenant
were
sentenced
each
to
twelve
strokes
with
the
birch
rod
whilst
the
other
four
not
being
caught
received
six
strokes
each
i
do
not
at
present
feel
much
remorse
for
those
desperate
times
but
often
think
of
the
disgrace
to
parents
the
kindly
admonishment
of
my
schoolmaster
made
me
shed
the
real
tears
of
repentance
not
being
forced
from
me
by
any
thought
of
punishment
this
ended
my
schooldays
and
after
the
breaking
up
of
our
gang
i
was
not
allowed
much
liberty
our
elders
being
afraid
of
a
reorganisation
when
i
was
allowed
out
for
an
hour
play
strict
injunctions
were
given
me
not
to
leave
our
own
door
and
this
was
not
much
to
my
liking
in
the
dark
winter
evenings
i
would
sit
with
my
grandfather
my
brother
and
sister
painting
ships
or
reading
before
a
large
fire
that
was
never
allowed
to
burn
below
its
highest
bar
my
grandfather
with
his
old
habits
would
pace
slowly
up
and
down
the
half
dark
passage
shutting
himself
out
in
the
cold
every
now
and
then
he
would
open
the
front
door
to
look
at
the
stars
or
to
inform
himself
from
what
latitude
the
wind
blew
the
wind
never
changed
without
his
knowledge
for
this
wary
mariner
invariably
surprised
it
in
the
act
of
doing
so
three
or
four
times
in
the
evening
he
would
open
the
kitchen
door
to
see
that
his
family
were
comfortable
as
though
he
had
just
made
his
way
from
the
hurricane
deck
to
enquire
after
the
welfare
of
passengers
in
the
cabin
when
this
was
done
the
old
lady
would
sometimes
say
rather
peevishly
francis
do
sit
down
for
a
minute
or
two
then
he
would
answer
gruffly
but
not
unkindly
avast
there
lydia
closing
the
door
to
begin
again
his
steady
pacing
to
and
fro
at
this
time
i
had
a
boy
companion
named
dave
who
was
a
great
reader
had
enough
to
recite
in
public
and
was
a
wonderful
raconteur
of
tales
great
things
were
expected
of
him
in
after
years
i
have
heard
since
that
intemperance
prevented
their
fulfilment
but
we
were
too
innocent
in
those
days
to
think
that
such
would
be
the
case
through
him
i
became
a
reader
in
the
first
place
with
an
idea
of
emulating
his
cleverness
which
led
to
a
love
of
literature
for
its
own
self
of
course
i
began
with
the
common
penny
novel
of
the
worst
type
but
acquired
a
taste
for
better
work
in
a
shorter
time
than
boys
usually
do
chapter
ii
youth
life
was
very
irksome
to
me
at
this
period
being
led
to
chapel
morning
and
evening
on
sundays
and
led
back
having
the
mortification
of
seeing
other
boys
of
the
same
age
enjoying
their
liberty
the
only
way
to
alter
these
conditions
was
to
apply
for
work
this
was
soon
done
hiring
myself
out
to
an
ironmonger
at
a
weekly
wage
of
five
shillings
the
old
people
now
began
to
take
a
pride
in
me
advising
me
to
study
my
master
interests
and
without
doubt
succeed
to
his
business
at
his
decease
my
brother
two
years
my
senior
who
as
i
have
said
before
was
odd
in
his
behaviour
took
example
by
me
and
succeeded
in
being
employed
at
a
large
clothing
establishment
it
was
there
and
then
that
he
began
and
finished
his
life
work
in
half
a
day
having
been
sent
to
the
dock
with
a
large
parcel
valued
at
two
pounds
ten
shillings
he
found
on
arrival
that
the
was
moored
in
the
middle
of
the
dock
my
brother
seeing
this
and
not
being
blessed
with
inventive
faculties
placed
the
parcel
on
the
quay
and
returned
to
his
master
naturally
the
shopkeeper
thought
it
was
safely
delivered
until
the
captain
of
the
coming
straight
from
his
ship
entered
the
shop
to
make
enquiries
about
his
goods
my
brother
having
a
clear
conscience
explained
matters
in
his
simple
way
to
the
open
eyed
astonishment
of
his
hearers
the
result
was
a
summary
dismissal
and
a
letter
to
my
grandfather
requesting
him
to
make
good
the
loss
of
the
parcel
which
was
duly
done
my
grandfather
being
extremely
afraid
of
the
law
the
old
people
would
never
admit
that
my
brother
was
different
from
other
boys
although
it
was
apparent
not
only
to
grown
folk
but
to
the
smallest
child
in
the
street
some
days
before
the
affair
just
mentioned
my
grandmother
having
to
answer
the
door
ordered
my
brother
to
watch
some
fish
which
was
being
prepared
for
dinner
when
she
returned
the
cat
was
enjoying
a
good
meal
under
the
sofa
to
the
old
lady
cry
of
francis
did
i
not
tell
you
to
watch
the
fish
my
brother
answered
truthfully
for
he
always
told
the
truth
and
did
what
he
was
told
so
i
did
grandmother
and
the
cat
took
it
if
she
had
explained
to
him
properly
why
she
wanted
the
fish
watched
at
the
same
time
making
special
mention
of
a
cat
partiality
for
fish
no
doubt
he
would
have
watched
to
better
purpose
nothing
could
have
happened
better
than
this
instance
of
the
loss
of
the
ship
goods
to
undeceive
my
grandfather
as
to
my
brother
state
of
mind
a
sudden
blaze
of
intelligence
broke
in
on
the
old
mind
which
was
not
of
the
most
brilliant
kind
lydia
said
he
to
his
wife
there
something
wrong
with
the
boy
to
think
he
did
not
have
sense
enough
to
shout
ship
ahoy
i
ventured
to
say
to
show
my
cleverness
that
there
might
have
been
several
ships
in
the
middle
of
the
dock
and
they
would
have
all
answered
to
ship
ahoy
would
it
not
have
been
better
to
cry
ahoy
the
old
man
paused
thunderstruck
avast
there
he
cried
drop
anchor
will
ye
have
more
pudding
in
our
street
almost
every
woman
had
some
one
connected
with
the
sea
and
it
was
my
grandfather
pleasure
by
day
to
parade
the
street
and
inform
the
women
as
to
what
winds
and
tides
were
favourable
to
their
husbands
or
sons
one
woman
had
a
husband
that
had
sailed
away
in
a
barque
which
was
never
sighted
or
hailed
after
leaving
port
and
was
now
three
months
overdue
my
grandfather
feared
to
meet
this
wife
and
would
often
peep
around
his
door
trying
to
escape
consultation
from
her
knowing
well
his
own
forebodings
as
to
the
fate
of
the
barque
and
her
crew
i
have
mentioned
dave
who
was
a
very
studious
lad
and
who
became
my
one
companion
and
the
sharer
of
my
dreams
he
had
received
an
old
copy
of
byron
and
we
both
became
fascinated
by
the
personality
of
that
poet
his
influence
on
dave
was
so
great
that
it
was
publicly
shown
to
all
the
boys
and
girls
in
the
chapel
schoolroom
where
we
had
gathered
for
childish
games
under
the
supervision
of
the
elders
while
we
were
playing
kiss
in
the
ring
singing
and
laughing
dancing
with
merriment
when
small
white
teeth
red
lips
and
bright
eyes
were
all
the
rage
dave
would
lean
his
figure
not
so
tall
as
he
would
like
it
against
a
pillar
biting
his
lips
and
frowning
at
our
none
but
myself
knew
that
his
troubles
and
sorrows
were
purely
imaginary
but
they
certainly
succeeded
in
causing
some
sensation
even
the
notice
of
the
elders
being
drawn
to
him
some
time
after
this
we
had
more
trouble
with
dave
when
we
went
for
a
trip
to
the
on
this
occasion
he
took
his
own
path
across
the
sands
a
solitary
figure
with
his
head
bowed
and
when
we
called
him
he
would
not
heed
us
that
night
when
it
was
time
to
return
dave
stood
perilously
near
the
edge
of
the
pier
gazing
with
melancholy
eyes
on
the
water
several
women
hastened
towards
him
and
drawing
him
gently
away
enquired
as
to
his
trouble
on
which
dave
stood
erect
was
motionless
frowned
bit
his
lip
and
stalked
away
into
the
darkness
without
uttering
a
word
he
came
back
in
time
to
catch
the
boat
dave
soon
got
tired
of
these
doings
but
the
influence
of
byron
was
more
lasting
on
me
it
was
the
first
time
for
me
to
read
verse
with
enjoyment
i
read
shelley
marlowe
and
shakespeare
indifferent
to
wordsworth
but
giving
him
since
the
attention
of
wiser
days
my
grandmother
had
only
read
one
novel
in
her
life
called
the
children
of
the
abbey
and
had
been
severely
punished
by
her
mother
for
doing
so
she
therefore
continually
warned
me
against
reading
such
works
but
strongly
recommended
milton
paradise
lost
and
night
thoughts
her
favourite
quotation
being
from
the
latter
procrastination
is
the
thief
of
time
it
pleased
her
to
tears
when
a
friend
saw
a
likeness
between
john
bunyan
and
myself
and
she
regretted
that
she
saw
no
prospect
of
ever
tracing
a
resemblance
between
our
hearts
i
was
now
bound
apprentice
to
the
picture
frame
trade
but
owing
to
my
passion
for
reading
could
not
apply
myself
sufficiently
to
that
business
so
as
to
become
a
good
workman
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
i
was
reading
deep
into
the
night
and
having
to
be
up
early
for
work
was
encroaching
on
nature
allowance
of
sleep
owing
to
being
young
and
conceited
and
not
being
satisfied
at
having
knowledge
concealed
i
showed
at
this
time
some
parts
that
made
older
and
wiser
people
of
both
sexes
prophesy
good
results
in
manhood
having
no
knowledge
of
metre
and
very
little
of
harmony
i
composed
and
caused
to
be
printed
a
poem
describing
a
storm
at
night
which
a
young
friend
recited
at
a
mutual
improvement
class
making
after
mention
of
the
author
name
when
i
was
publicly
congratulated
some
time
after
this
i
having
surreptitiously
visited
the
playhouse
on
more
than
one
occasion
boldly
read
out
an
article
to
the
same
class
entitled
in
defence
of
the
stage
this
daring
performance
caused
some
commotion
among
the
full
grown
sheep
who
thought
they
detected
a
wolf
in
clothing
but
the
young
lamb
my
companions
bleated
for
pride
and
joy
my
grandmother
was
told
of
this
and
as
she
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
enquire
the
subject
of
my
address
and
it
was
not
told
unto
her
she
was
satisfied
to
know
i
had
surprised
several
members
of
the
congregation
and
in
particular
a
deacon
for
whom
she
had
great
respect
it
has
always
been
a
wonder
to
me
where
my
conversational
power
has
gone
at
the
present
time
i
can
not
impress
the
most
ordinary
men
it
must
be
through
associating
so
many
years
with
companions
uncongenial
to
my
taste
a
preference
for
indulging
in
my
own
thoughts
and
forcing
myself
to
comment
on
subjects
uninteresting
to
me
i
remember
at
one
time
being
in
a
lodging
house
where
one
man
stood
out
as
an
authority
on
books
disease
politics
military
tactics
and
more
especially
the
meaning
and
right
pronunciation
of
words
several
times
different
men
have
said
to
me
that
man
is
a
scholar
he
is
not
an
ignoramus
as
the
likes
of
you
and
me
it
was
a
secret
satisfaction
to
know
that
this
gentleman
to
whom
they
referred
often
paid
the
compliment
of
knowing
more
than
himself
by
asking
information
which
on
my
part
was
imparted
with
much
secrecy
as
i
did
not
wish
to
appear
in
any
way
superior
to
those
with
whom
i
was
forced
by
circumstances
to
associate
yet
in
those
happy
days
of
my
apprenticeship
i
rarely
visited
a
house
but
what
a
second
invitation
was
assured
although
a
painful
shyness
marred
the
beginning
we
enjoyed
ourselves
so
much
one
evening
at
a
friend
house
where
the
lady
had
been
all
day
indisposed
that
her
husband
said
on
leaving
my
wife
has
been
laughed
out
of
her
sickness
and
you
have
certainly
saved
me
an
item
on
the
doctor
bill
instead
of
this
giving
more
confidence
and
overcoming
my
shyness
when
i
received
from
them
an
invitation
for
a
second
party
i
became
so
overpowered
at
the
thought
of
what
would
be
expected
of
me
that
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
accept
it
knowing
i
would
have
made
an
ass
of
myself
it
is
not
altogether
shyness
that
now
makes
me
unsuccessful
in
company
sometimes
it
is
a
state
of
mind
that
is
three
parts
meditation
that
will
not
free
the
thoughts
until
their
attendant
trains
are
prepared
to
follow
them
again
having
heard
so
much
slang
my
thoughts
often
clothe
themselves
in
that
stuff
from
their
first
nakedness
that
being
the
case
shame
and
confusion
in
good
company
make
me
take
so
long
to
undress
and
clothe
them
better
in
more
seemly
garments
that
other
people
grow
tired
of
waiting
and
take
upon
themselves
the
honour
of
entertainers
it
was
in
the
second
year
of
my
apprenticeship
that
i
met
a
young
woman
living
in
a
small
village
adjoining
this
town
of
my
birth
who
was
very
clever
a
great
reader
of
fine
literature
and
it
was
to
her
hands
after
i
had
enjoyed
her
conversation
on
several
occasions
that
i
submitted
a
small
composition
of
my
own
her
encouragement
at
that
early
time
has
been
the
star
on
which
these
eyes
have
seldom
closed
by
which
i
have
successfully
navigated
the
deeps
of
misery
pushing
aside
drink
my
first
officer
who
many
a
day
and
many
a
night
endeavoured
to
founder
me
she
was
the
first
to
recognise
in
my
spirit
something
different
from
mere
cleverness
something
she
had
seen
and
recognised
in
her
books
but
had
never
before
met
in
a
living
person
i
had
known
her
only
six
months
when
she
died
but
her
words
of
encouragement
have
been
ringing
in
my
ears
ever
since
they
were
uttered
my
grandfather
had
also
died
a
straightforward
honest
simple
man
with
a
mortal
dread
of
being
in
debt
and
always
well
prepared
to
pay
his
rates
and
taxes
he
had
a
horror
of
being
a
principal
in
the
police
courts
but
appeared
there
three
times
for
no
offence
of
his
own
called
upon
once
to
examine
a
rope
supposed
to
be
stolen
from
a
ship
he
proved
the
rope
was
of
the
land
and
different
from
a
rope
discharge
of
the
prisoner
on
another
occasion
sunday
morning
and
grandfather
being
in
bed
a
detective
disguised
as
a
poor
working
man
that
was
almost
dying
for
a
drink
wheedled
the
old
man
daughter
to
sell
him
some
liquor
over
the
back
wall
the
result
being
a
summons
for
supplying
drink
during
closed
hours
followed
by
a
heavy
fine
which
was
at
once
paid
the
third
time
was
at
my
trial
with
five
other
desperadoes
as
described
in
the
preceding
chapter
there
was
nothing
false
about
this
man
and
he
had
the
heart
of
a
lion
he
claimed
to
have
beaten
the
champion
of
portsmouth
but
undoubtedly
this
was
some
drunken
fellow
who
had
taken
on
himself
this
much
coveted
title
grandfather
pet
yarn
which
i
have
heard
him
recount
a
hundred
times
took
place
in
a
public
house
where
a
thin
partition
divided
him
from
another
person
who
was
loudly
extolling
himself
to
the
admiration
of
others
grandfather
allowed
this
man
to
continue
for
some
time
but
at
last
losing
patience
he
looked
around
the
partition
and
cried
in
a
stern
voice
avast
there
captain
jones
i
knew
thee
when
thou
wert
glad
to
eat
barley
bread
without
butter
captain
jones
looked
disconcerted
at
this
remark
and
then
quickly
putting
his
own
head
around
the
partition
whispered
hush
hush
captain
davies
there
nothing
like
making
one
self
look
big
in
a
strange
place
i
was
now
in
the
last
year
of
my
apprenticeship
and
was
running
a
bit
wild
taking
no
interest
in
my
trade
and
determined
in
a
few
months
to
throw
off
all
restraint
when
my
time
had
expired
my
master
wanted
me
to
continue
working
for
him
which
i
did
for
a
short
time
and
for
one
who
had
not
yet
reached
his
year
received
a
very
fair
wage
in
three
or
four
months
i
found
some
excuse
for
leaving
i
was
eager
to
start
for
the
new
world
but
my
grandmother
would
not
on
any
account
supply
money
for
that
purpose
so
i
applied
for
work
at
bristol
was
accepted
and
worked
there
six
months
being
then
called
home
through
the
death
of
the
good
old
lady
the
licence
indulged
in
during
these
six
months
being
in
a
strange
town
and
unknown
was
sufficient
to
wreck
the
brains
and
health
of
any
man
beyond
recovery
and
for
the
time
being
deadened
all
literary
ambition
it
could
not
have
continued
this
way
much
longer
and
no
doubt
it
was
her
death
that
prevented
the
collapse
of
my
life
by
a
change
of
circumstances
her
estate
was
in
the
hands
of
a
trustee
and
its
profits
were
to
be
divided
weekly
among
her
three
grandchildren
she
was
a
good
old
soul
and
i
have
lived
long
enough
to
cherish
every
hair
of
her
head
she
was
a
baptist
stoutly
opposed
to
other
creeds
called
the
stage
the
devil
playground
abhorred
second
marriages
and
thought
as
much
of
me
in
life
as
i
think
of
her
in
death
many
of
the
little
kindnesses
that
were
given
to
her
in
life
were
done
more
out
of
a
sense
of
duty
than
from
the
gratitude
of
which
she
was
so
worthy
but
the
good
old
soul
died
without
suspecting
any
other
than
gratitude
mine
is
the
shame
and
sorrow
that
she
did
not
receive
it
as
i
am
even
now
thirteen
years
after
her
death
living
on
her
bounty
when
my
grandmother
died
i
joined
home
with
mother
and
her
second
family
but
after
a
month
or
two
of
restlessness
i
sought
the
trustee
got
an
advance
from
him
of
some
fifteen
pounds
and
full
of
hope
and
expectation
embarked
for
america
chapter
iii
manhood
on
arriving
at
liverpool
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
man
who
had
been
in
america
some
years
previously
and
not
having
his
hopes
realised
at
that
time
had
returned
desperate
to
england
taken
in
a
fresh
cargo
of
hopes
and
was
now
making
a
second
attempt
with
as
much
enthusiasm
if
not
more
than
others
in
making
their
first
in
him
i
placed
implicit
confidence
and
received
such
an
extraordinary
description
of
that
country
the
number
of
stories
of
some
of
its
highest
buildings
which
were
called
skyscrapers
the
houses
of
wood
which
could
be
moved
from
one
street
to
another
without
in
any
way
interfering
with
the
comfort
of
the
people
within
cooking
sweeping
and
washing
going
on
without
hindrance
the
loneliness
of
its
prairies
and
deserts
engineering
triumphs
over
high
mountains
and
how
the
glorious
south
was
flushed
with
roses
what
time
the
north
could
not
save
a
blade
of
green
from
the
snow
all
this
happening
under
the
one
wide
spreading
flag
this
made
such
an
impression
on
me
that
i
at
once
went
to
the
steerage
cabin
and
wrote
a
full
description
of
the
country
that
very
first
evening
aboard
telling
of
my
arrival
in
america
and
the
difference
between
the
old
and
the
new
world
this
letter
was
given
to
the
steward
at
queenstown
and
was
written
to
save
me
the
trouble
of
writing
on
my
arrival
so
that
i
might
have
more
time
to
enjoy
myself
several
years
elapsed
before
it
occurred
to
me
how
foolish
and
thoughtless
i
had
been
the
postmark
itself
would
prove
that
i
had
not
landed
in
america
and
they
would
also
receive
the
letter
several
days
before
it
would
be
due
from
those
distant
shores
i
can
certainly
not
boast
a
large
amount
of
common
sense
it
was
in
the
month
of
june
when
we
made
this
voyage
and
the
great
atlantic
was
as
smooth
as
an
inland
river
every
one
sought
to
escape
the
thoughts
of
home
and
to
do
so
we
often
worked
ourselves
into
a
frenzy
of
singing
and
dancing
sometimes
our
attention
would
be
drawn
to
an
iceberg
on
the
port
side
very
innocent
and
beautiful
to
the
eyes
of
passengers
but
feared
by
mariners
who
saw
into
its
depths
and
then
a
ship
full
sail
or
another
great
atlantic
liner
on
the
starboard
bow
there
was
a
total
lack
of
ceremony
aboard
strangers
familiar
with
strangers
and
the
sexes
doing
each
other
little
kindnesses
who
had
never
met
before
and
probably
would
never
meet
again
parting
without
even
enquiring
or
giving
each
other
a
name
as
we
neared
the
coast
we
had
a
thunderstorm
and
i
was
surprised
and
somewhat
awed
at
the
sound
of
its
peals
and
at
the
slower
and
larger
flashes
of
lightning
nature
it
seemed
used
a
freer
and
more
powerful
hand
in
this
country
of
great
things
than
is
her
wont
among
our
pretty
little
dales
and
our
small
green
hills
i
thought
the
world
was
coming
to
an
end
and
in
no
way
felt
reassured
when
an
american
noting
my
expression
said
that
it
was
nothing
to
what
i
would
see
and
hear
if
i
remained
long
in
god
own
country
of
free
and
law
abiding
citizens
my
impression
of
americans
from
the
beginning
is
of
the
best
and
i
have
never
since
had
cause
to
alter
my
mind
they
are
a
kind
sympathetic
race
of
people
and
naturally
proud
of
their
country
the
is
inclined
to
be
the
most
bitter
remembering
from
his
youth
the
complaints
of
his
parents
who
were
driven
through
unjust
laws
from
their
own
beloved
land
and
such
a
man
is
not
to
be
idly
aggravated
for
life
is
a
serious
subject
to
him
this
man
is
not
to
be
aggravated
especially
under
the
consideration
that
our
conscience
is
not
too
clean
in
this
respect
and
that
we
are
apt
to
be
very
slow
in
making
that
open
confession
which
is
good
for
the
soul
the
most
pleasing
trait
in
americans
which
can
not
for
long
escape
us
is
their
respect
for
women
and
the
way
in
which
the
latter
do
their
utmost
to
deserve
it
no
sight
of
a
woman
behind
the
saloon
bar
listening
to
the
ribald
jests
of
drunken
men
and
no
woman
at
the
bar
front
drinking
glass
for
glass
with
her
associates
however
weak
in
this
respect
a
woman
may
be
in
private
she
is
certainly
too
strong
to
make
a
public
exhibition
of
her
weakness
husband
and
wife
may
be
unhappy
but
you
seldom
hear
of
a
woman
carrying
the
marks
of
a
man
brutality
as
witnesses
against
him
which
is
so
common
in
the
police
courts
of
old
england
a
man
in
a
fit
of
ungovernable
passion
may
kill
his
wife
and
better
so
i
should
say
than
to
leave
her
half
killed
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
every
saturday
night
and
holidays
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
and
blacken
her
eyes
before
they
can
recover
their
natural
colour
the
brutality
that
shamed
me
so
much
in
after
years
in
the
slums
of
london
hearing
it
so
often
recorded
as
a
jest
i
was
so
anxious
to
see
the
different
states
of
america
that
i
did
not
stay
long
in
new
york
before
i
succumbed
to
the
persuasion
of
my
liverpool
acquaintance
to
visit
with
him
some
friends
in
a
small
town
in
the
state
of
connecticut
at
which
place
we
soon
arrived
with
something
like
ten
dollars
between
us
america
at
this
time
was
suffering
from
a
depression
in
trade
and
people
were
daily
returning
to
the
old
country
most
of
them
with
the
intention
of
returning
again
to
america
at
a
more
favourable
time
not
being
able
to
get
employment
at
once
and
resolved
to
be
independent
of
the
bounty
of
strangers
i
walked
out
alone
and
sat
on
a
seat
in
the
park
trying
to
conceive
some
plans
for
the
future
my
box
full
of
clothes
books
brushes
would
amply
compensate
i
thought
for
the
week
lodging
which
i
had
had
yes
i
would
see
chicago
and
suddenly
becoming
aware
of
a
man
occupying
the
other
end
of
the
seat
i
enquired
of
him
the
way
to
chicago
as
though
the
distance
was
a
paltry
ten
miles
instead
of
a
hundred
times
greater
this
man
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
and
at
last
asked
me
if
i
intended
to
beat
my
way
seeing
my
lack
of
understanding
he
enquired
as
to
my
financial
resources
on
shaking
my
head
in
the
negative
implying
that
i
had
no
money
he
said
no
more
have
i
and
if
you
are
agreeable
we
will
both
beat
our
way
to
chicago
this
was
brum
a
notorious
beggar
who
made
himself
at
home
in
all
parts
of
the
country
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
coast
and
from
the
northern
provinces
of
canada
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
the
easy
and
sumptuous
way
of
his
catering
made
me
indifferent
to
all
manual
labour
in
that
country
where
food
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
where
it
often
went
begging
to
be
received
and
people
were
not
likely
to
suffer
for
their
generosity
i
became
under
brum
tutorage
a
lazy
wretch
with
but
little
inclination
for
work
cockneys
make
good
beggars
they
are
held
in
high
esteem
by
the
fraternity
in
america
their
resources
originality
and
invention
and
a
never
faltering
tongue
enable
them
to
often
attain
their
ends
where
others
fail
and
they
succeed
where
the
natives
starve
but
my
friend
brum
held
them
in
great
scorn
for
their
methods
were
not
his
methods
brum
was
a
genuine
beggar
who
did
not
make
flashes
in
the
dark
having
one
day
plenty
and
nothing
on
the
next
day
what
he
required
he
proceeded
to
beg
every
morning
making
an
inventory
of
his
wants
rather
than
wash
a
good
handkerchief
he
would
beg
an
old
one
that
was
clean
and
he
would
without
compunction
discard
a
good
shirt
altogether
rather
than
sew
a
button
on
thus
keeping
up
the
dignity
of
his
profession
to
the
extreme
he
scorned
to
carry
soap
but
went
to
a
house
like
a
christian
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
wash
with
a
request
for
warm
water
if
the
morning
was
cold
begging
was
to
him
a
fine
art
indeed
and
a
delight
of
which
he
never
seemed
to
tire
i
have
known
him
when
surfeited
with
an
abundance
of
common
food
such
as
steak
chops
to
beg
lozenges
and
sweets
complaining
i
suppose
of
throat
troubles
even
in
a
new
country
like
america
there
are
quite
a
number
of
hostile
towns
owing
to
their
lying
on
the
main
roads
between
large
cities
that
are
not
far
apart
but
brum
never
seemed
to
fail
and
would
certainly
never
lower
his
dignity
by
complaining
of
difficulty
in
every
street
he
said
there
lived
a
good
samaritan
and
seeing
that
a
good
beggar
knocks
at
every
door
he
must
ultimately
succeed
she
may
live
in
the
last
house
and
therefore
the
unsuccessful
beggar
having
no
patience
and
perseverance
fails
in
his
calling
brum
was
a
slow
man
in
action
and
went
about
his
business
in
a
dogged
way
and
that
reminds
me
of
how
this
slowness
of
action
once
saved
his
life
we
had
built
a
camp
fire
in
the
woods
within
a
mile
or
more
of
a
small
town
now
it
was
brum
habit
before
lying
down
for
the
night
to
wind
his
handkerchief
around
his
neck
and
this
he
had
done
next
morning
i
was
the
first
to
rise
and
brum
deliberately
following
my
example
began
in
his
own
easy
way
to
slowly
unwind
this
handkerchief
when
to
my
horror
a
large
tarantula
fell
from
its
folds
now
had
brum
been
an
impulsive
man
no
doubt
the
spider
would
have
been
squeezed
and
would
have
then
fastened
on
his
neck
and
poisoned
his
blood
mortally
i
was
soon
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
beating
my
way
by
train
which
is
so
necessary
in
parts
of
that
country
seeing
the
great
distances
between
towns
sometimes
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
get
an
empty
car
sometimes
we
had
to
ride
the
bumpers
and
often
when
travelling
through
a
hostile
country
we
rode
on
the
roof
of
a
car
so
as
not
to
give
the
brakesman
an
opportunity
of
striking
us
off
the
bumpers
unawares
it
is
nothing
unusual
in
some
parts
to
find
a
man
always
a
stranger
lying
dead
on
the
track
often
cut
in
many
pieces
at
the
inquest
they
invariably
bring
in
a
verdict
of
accidental
death
but
we
know
different
therefore
we
rode
the
car
top
so
as
to
be
at
no
disadvantage
in
a
struggle
the
brakesman
knowing
well
that
our
fall
would
be
his
own
would
not
be
too
eager
to
commence
hostilities
sometimes
we
were
desperate
enough
to
ride
the
narrow
iron
rods
which
were
under
the
car
and
only
a
few
feet
from
the
track
this
required
some
nerve
for
it
was
not
only
uncomfortable
but
the
train
being
so
near
the
line
seemed
to
be
running
at
a
reckless
and
uncontrollable
speed
whereas
when
riding
on
the
top
a
much
faster
train
seems
to
be
running
much
slower
and
far
more
smooth
and
safe
sometimes
we
were
forced
to
jump
off
a
moving
train
at
the
point
of
a
revolver
at
other
times
the
brakesmen
were
friendly
and
even
offered
assistance
in
the
way
of
food
drink
or
tobacco
again
when
no
firearm
was
in
evidence
we
had
to
threaten
the
brakesman
with
death
if
he
interfered
with
us
in
this
way
brum
and
myself
travelled
the
states
of
america
sleeping
at
night
by
camp
fires
and
taking
temporary
possession
of
empty
houses
one
night
when
darkness
had
overtaken
us
before
we
could
find
a
fit
and
comfortable
place
for
camping
we
spied
a
house
and
seeing
no
light
in
the
window
presumed
it
to
be
unoccupied
we
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
hollow
sound
which
followed
convinced
us
that
no
living
person
was
then
on
the
premises
when
we
lifted
the
latch
and
entered
we
were
surprised
to
see
chairs
a
table
and
various
articles
of
domestic
utility
scattered
in
confusion
on
the
floor
in
spite
of
this
we
proceeded
to
make
ourselves
easy
for
the
night
and
coming
out
again
began
to
feel
in
the
darkness
for
wood
being
successful
in
our
search
we
returned
and
made
a
fire
and
there
we
slept
until
morning
as
usual
i
was
the
first
to
rise
on
the
following
day
and
went
forth
in
quest
of
water
to
make
our
breakfast
coffee
this
i
soon
found
and
was
bearing
it
along
when
my
attention
was
drawn
to
a
board
nailed
to
the
front
of
the
house
there
i
saw
the
letters
haunted
painted
large
and
ragged
as
though
by
a
hand
that
had
shaken
with
fear
if
we
had
seen
this
board
on
the
night
previous
no
doubt
we
would
have
hurried
on
in
dread
of
our
lives
but
as
it
was
we
made
our
coffee
and
laughed
heartily
in
the
daylight
at
this
time
i
took
a
notion
to
work
for
a
few
days
but
brum
showed
his
grinning
face
so
often
that
i
grew
ashamed
of
him
and
discharged
myself
he
seemed
to
have
taken
a
strange
liking
to
me
and
would
not
leave
me
but
swore
that
not
even
for
my
sake
would
he
become
a
working
man
chapter
iv
brum
brum
was
a
man
of
an
original
turn
of
mind
and
his
ideas
were
often
at
variance
with
others
for
instance
all
tramps
in
america
travel
on
the
railroad
whether
they
walk
or
take
free
rides
therefore
it
seems
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
people
who
live
on
the
outskirts
of
a
town
being
farthest
from
the
track
would
be
more
in
sympathy
with
tramps
for
they
would
see
and
hear
less
of
them
but
brum
laughed
at
this
idea
and
claimed
that
his
own
success
was
through
being
of
a
different
mind
for
said
he
as
all
tramps
are
of
that
opinion
therefore
the
outskirts
are
begged
too
much
and
the
centre
of
the
town
too
little
for
instance
he
continued
here
is
the
railroad
depot
with
its
restaurant
now
not
one
tramp
in
a
hundred
would
visit
such
a
place
for
it
is
on
their
direct
road
and
they
believe
that
it
receives
far
too
many
appeals
this
opinion
being
so
common
must
prove
it
to
be
false
however
we
will
test
it
and
see
saying
which
brum
boldly
entered
the
restaurant
leaving
me
to
wait
outside
it
was
a
considerable
time
before
he
reappeared
and
i
began
to
think
that
he
was
being
supplied
with
a
meal
on
the
premises
but
at
last
he
came
carrying
in
his
hand
a
large
paper
parcel
the
place
is
as
good
as
gold
said
he
for
here
we
have
a
day
provisions
for
two
take
it
down
the
track
to
that
clump
of
woods
said
he
for
the
waiter
promised
that
did
i
bring
a
jug
or
can
he
would
supply
me
with
hot
coffee
i
started
at
once
towards
the
woods
with
this
bag
the
weight
of
which
proved
the
presence
of
either
much
meat
or
pudding
while
brum
made
his
way
to
a
small
house
near
the
railroad
to
see
if
he
could
borrow
a
can
it
was
not
long
after
this
when
we
were
seated
in
the
shady
green
wood
with
the
contents
of
this
parcel
before
us
which
were
found
to
consist
of
a
number
of
chops
bread
and
butter
some
potatoes
and
cake
these
with
a
quart
or
more
of
good
hot
coffee
made
such
a
meal
as
a
working
man
could
only
reasonably
expect
once
a
week
the
day
being
sunday
one
of
brum
peculiarities
was
on
approaching
a
town
to
look
out
for
a
church
steeple
with
a
cross
which
denoted
a
catholic
church
and
therefore
a
catholic
community
making
his
way
in
the
direction
of
that
cross
he
would
begin
operations
in
its
surrounding
streets
and
said
he
if
i
fail
in
that
portion
of
the
town
i
shall
certainly
not
succeed
elsewhere
i
shall
never
forget
the
happy
summer
months
i
spent
with
brum
at
the
seaside
some
of
the
rich
merchants
there
could
not
spare
more
than
a
month
or
six
weeks
from
business
but
thanks
be
to
providence
the
whole
summer
was
at
our
disposal
if
we
grew
tired
of
one
town
or
as
more
often
the
case
the
town
grew
tired
of
us
we
would
saunter
leisurely
to
the
next
one
and
again
pitch
our
camp
so
on
from
place
to
place
during
the
summer
months
we
moved
freely
among
the
visitors
who
apparently
held
us
in
great
respect
for
they
did
not
address
us
familiarly
but
contented
themselves
with
staring
at
a
distance
we
lay
across
their
runs
on
the
sands
and
their
paths
in
the
woods
we
monopolised
their
nooks
in
the
rocks
and
took
possession
of
caves
and
not
a
murmur
heard
except
from
the
sea
which
of
a
certainty
could
not
be
laid
to
our
account
no
doubt
detectives
were
in
these
places
but
they
were
on
the
look
out
for
pickpockets
burglars
and
swindlers
and
seeing
that
neither
the
visitors
nor
the
boarding
house
keepers
made
any
complaint
these
detectives
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
arrest
tramps
for
there
was
no
promotion
to
be
had
by
doing
so
ah
i
said
to
brum
as
we
sat
in
a
shady
place
eating
a
large
custard
pudding
from
a
boarding
house
using
for
the
purpose
two
spoons
of
wood
ah
we
would
not
be
so
pleasantly
occupied
as
tramps
in
england
we
would
there
receive
tickets
for
soup
soup
that
could
be
taken
without
spoons
no
pleasant
picking
of
the
teeth
after
eating
no
sign
of
a
pea
onion
or
carrot
no
sign
of
anything
except
flies
of
a
large
custard
pudding
between
two
of
us
and
if
there
was
one
fault
to
be
found
with
it
it
was
its
being
made
with
too
many
eggs
even
brum
was
surprised
at
his
success
on
this
occasion
although
as
he
said
she
being
a
fat
lady
i
expected
something
unusual
brum
had
a
great
admiration
for
a
fat
woman
not
so
much
i
believe
as
his
particular
type
of
beauty
but
for
the
good
natured
qualities
he
claimed
corpulence
denoted
how
can
you
expect
those
skinny
creatures
to
sympathise
with
another
when
they
half
starve
their
own
bodies
he
asked
he
often
descanted
on
the
excellencies
of
the
fat
to
the
detriment
of
the
thin
and
i
never
yet
heard
another
beggar
disagree
with
him
after
seeing
brum
wash
the
dish
and
wipe
it
with
his
with
a
care
that
almost
amounted
to
reverence
and
trusting
in
my
own
mind
that
the
good
lady
would
have
the
thought
and
precaution
to
wash
it
again
i
settled
to
a
short
nap
till
return
for
there
was
no
knowing
how
long
he
might
be
away
he
might
take
a
notion
to
beg
a
shirt
a
pair
of
trousers
or
shoes
or
anything
else
that
came
to
his
mind
now
when
brum
left
he
had
on
a
dark
shirt
but
i
was
so
accustomed
to
seeing
him
change
his
appearance
with
a
fresh
coat
or
a
different
shaped
hat
that
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
on
waking
to
see
him
sitting
before
me
in
a
clean
white
shirt
with
a
starched
front
i
said
nothing
about
this
change
and
he
was
too
good
a
beggar
to
give
unsolicited
information
which
would
look
too
much
like
boasting
of
his
own
exploits
that
he
had
met
another
of
his
favourite
fat
ladies
or
perhaps
the
same
one
had
added
to
her
kindness
there
was
not
the
least
doubt
brum
first
words
rather
startled
me
for
he
continued
the
conversation
from
the
place
i
left
off
previous
to
my
sleep
when
i
was
in
england
he
began
i
did
not
experience
such
hardship
as
is
commonly
supposed
to
exist
beggars
there
as
here
choose
the
wrong
places
and
not
one
in
three
knows
which
are
the
best
surely
i
said
a
good
clean
street
of
houses
with
respectable
fronts
of
moderate
size
and
kept
by
the
better
class
mechanics
are
the
best
and
so
they
would
be
he
answered
if
every
beggar
did
not
think
so
but
let
me
tell
you
for
your
benefit
if
ever
stranded
in
england
the
best
places
for
beggars
to
operate
how
i
learned
the
truth
of
his
wise
teaching
in
after
days
every
fine
looking
street
you
chance
upon
pass
it
but
every
little
court
or
blind
alley
you
come
across
take
possession
without
delay
especially
if
its
entrance
is
under
an
arch
which
hides
the
approach
to
the
houses
making
them
invisible
from
the
street
such
little
out
of
the
way
places
are
not
only
more
profitable
than
good
streets
but
are
comparatively
safe
where
the
police
are
unusually
severe
then
again
you
should
avoid
every
town
that
has
not
either
a
mill
a
factory
or
a
brewery
old
fashioned
towns
quiet
and
without
working
people
except
a
few
gardeners
coachmen
domestic
servants
etc
such
places
where
you
see
a
sign
at
the
free
libraries
warning
tramps
not
to
enter
and
every
plot
of
land
has
its
sign
beware
of
the
dog
in
towns
where
working
men
are
numerous
and
the
idle
rich
are
few
such
signs
are
not
to
be
seen
of
course
he
continued
your
object
in
england
must
be
money
for
you
can
not
expect
to
get
meat
cake
and
custard
pudding
in
a
land
where
even
the
rich
live
poorer
with
regards
to
diet
than
the
labouring
classes
of
this
country
i
remembered
these
wise
thoughts
of
brum
uttered
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
if
i
did
not
profit
much
by
them
in
my
own
experience
in
england
i
certainly
made
enough
attempts
to
test
their
truth
i
always
kept
a
keen
eye
for
blind
alleys
and
quiet
courts
under
arches
and
i
invariably
came
out
of
one
richer
than
i
went
in
and
what
nice
quiet
places
they
are
for
drinking
cups
of
tea
on
a
doorstep
with
only
a
neighbour
or
two
to
see
you
and
perhaps
thousands
of
people
passing
to
and
fro
in
the
street
at
the
other
side
of
the
arch
there
is
no
thoroughfare
for
horses
and
carts
no
short
cut
for
business
men
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
a
number
of
the
inhabitants
themselves
born
and
bred
in
the
town
know
not
of
the
existence
of
such
places
and
others
knowing
them
would
be
ashamed
to
confess
their
acquaintance
with
them
but
brum
knew
where
to
find
the
kindest
hearts
in
england
not
in
the
fine
streets
and
new
villas
but
in
the
poor
little
houses
in
courts
and
alleys
chapter
v
a
tramp
summer
vacation
we
were
determined
to
be
in
the
fashion
and
to
visit
the
various
delightful
watering
places
on
long
island
sound
of
course
it
would
be
necessary
to
combine
business
with
pleasure
and
pursue
our
calling
as
beggars
with
the
exception
of
begging
our
food
which
would
not
be
difficult
seeing
that
the
boarding
houses
were
full
and
that
large
quantities
of
good
stuff
were
being
made
there
was
no
reason
why
we
should
not
get
as
much
enjoyment
out
of
life
as
the
summer
visitors
we
would
share
with
them
the
same
sun
and
breeze
we
could
dip
in
the
surf
at
our
own
pleasure
and
during
the
heat
of
the
day
we
could
stretch
our
limbs
in
the
green
shade
or
in
the
shadow
of
some
large
rock
that
overlooked
the
sound
however
we
could
no
longer
stand
the
sultry
heat
of
new
york
where
we
had
been
for
several
days
during
which
time
we
had
been
groaning
and
gasping
for
air
so
i
and
brum
started
out
of
the
city
on
the
way
towards
hartford
connecticut
with
the
intention
of
walking
no
more
than
six
miles
a
day
along
the
sea
coast
what
a
glorious
time
we
had
the
people
catered
for
us
as
though
we
were
the
only
tramps
in
the
whole
world
and
as
if
they
considered
it
providential
that
we
should
call
at
their
houses
for
assistance
the
usual
order
of
things
changed
considerably
cake
which
we
had
hitherto
considered
as
a
luxury
became
at
this
time
our
common
food
and
we
were
at
last
compelled
to
install
plain
bread
and
butter
as
the
luxury
preferring
it
before
the
finest
flavoured
with
spices
and
eggs
fresh
water
springs
were
numerous
gushing
joyously
out
of
the
rocks
or
lying
quiet
in
shady
nooks
and
there
was
many
a
tramps
camp
with
tin
cans
ready
to
hand
where
we
could
make
our
coffee
and
consume
the
contents
of
paper
bags
this
part
of
the
country
was
also
exceptionally
good
for
clothes
summer
boarders
often
left
clothes
behind
and
of
what
use
were
they
to
the
landladies
for
no
man
ever
called
at
their
houses
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
in
less
than
a
week
i
was
well
dressed
from
head
to
foot
all
of
these
things
being
voluntary
offerings
when
in
quest
of
eatables
brum
of
course
had
fared
likewise
but
still
retained
the
same
pair
of
dungarees
which
he
swore
he
would
not
discard
except
at
the
instance
of
a
brand
new
pair
of
tweeds
it
was
this
pair
of
working
man
trousers
which
had
caused
a
most
regrettable
mistake
we
had
just
finished
begging
at
one
of
these
small
and
loaded
with
booty
were
on
our
way
in
the
direction
of
the
camp
which
brum
informed
me
was
half
a
mile
north
of
the
town
when
we
reached
this
camp
we
found
it
occupied
by
one
man
who
had
just
then
made
his
coffee
and
was
about
to
eat
on
which
brum
asked
this
man
permission
to
use
his
fire
which
would
save
us
the
trouble
of
making
one
of
our
own
the
stranger
gave
a
reluctant
consent
and
at
the
same
time
moved
some
distance
away
as
though
he
did
not
wish
further
intimacy
while
we
were
gathering
wood
and
filling
our
cans
at
the
spring
i
could
not
help
but
see
this
stranger
glaring
hatefully
at
my
companion
trousers
and
expected
every
moment
to
hear
some
insulting
remark
at
last
we
were
ready
and
brum
proceeded
to
unload
himself
he
had
eight
or
nine
parcels
of
food
distributed
about
his
clothes
but
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
could
be
the
wiser
it
was
then
that
i
noted
a
change
come
over
the
face
who
seeing
the
parcels
seemed
to
be
smitten
with
remorse
in
another
moment
he
was
on
his
feet
and
coming
towards
us
said
impulsively
excuse
me
boys
for
not
giving
you
a
more
hearty
welcome
but
really
glancing
again
at
my
companion
trousers
i
thought
you
were
working
men
but
i
now
see
that
you
are
true
beggars
brum
laughed
at
this
and
mentioned
that
others
had
also
been
deceived
he
explained
that
the
said
trousers
had
been
given
him
against
his
wish
but
on
seeing
that
they
were
good
and
were
likely
to
outlast
several
pairs
of
cloth
he
had
resolved
to
stick
to
them
for
another
month
or
two
i
regret
having
had
such
an
opinion
of
you
said
the
stranger
in
a
choking
voice
and
trust
boys
that
you
will
forgive
me
thus
ended
in
a
friendly
spirit
what
promised
at
first
to
become
very
unpleasant
this
stranger
turned
out
to
be
new
haven
baldy
we
had
never
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
him
before
but
had
often
heard
of
him
he
had
a
great
reputation
in
the
state
of
connecticut
which
he
never
left
except
for
an
annual
trip
through
massachusetts
to
the
city
of
boston
there
was
not
one
good
house
in
the
former
state
that
was
not
known
to
baldy
this
was
put
to
the
test
in
our
presence
that
very
day
a
man
came
to
the
camp
who
poor
fellow
claimed
to
be
a
man
he
had
lost
his
job
and
had
been
robbed
of
his
savings
now
being
forced
to
walk
home
to
meriden
he
had
never
begged
in
his
life
and
had
now
been
without
food
for
two
days
and
was
almost
too
weak
to
continue
his
journey
yes
said
baldy
and
when
you
are
settled
at
home
and
the
wrinkles
are
taken
out
of
you
what
sympathy
will
you
have
with
us
you
will
tell
us
to
go
and
work
for
our
living
the
same
as
yourself
the
poor
fellow
protested
saying
that
he
had
never
known
his
mother
to
refuse
any
man
food
at
this
baldy
pricked
up
his
ears
and
enquired
of
the
stranger
his
address
on
hearing
the
name
of
the
street
baldy
at
once
proceeded
to
describe
the
one
and
only
one
good
house
to
be
found
there
that
is
our
house
said
the
stranger
baldy
not
yet
convinced
asked
for
a
description
of
the
old
lady
and
her
husband
this
was
given
to
baldy
satisfaction
well
said
he
i
have
had
many
a
meal
at
your
house
and
you
shall
now
have
one
with
me
saying
which
he
gave
the
stranger
a
parcel
which
being
spread
on
the
grass
was
seen
to
contain
several
meat
sandwiches
and
a
number
of
small
cakes
after
eating
these
and
others
from
brum
the
stranger
left
saying
that
he
would
not
again
feel
hungry
until
he
reached
home
after
the
stranger
had
gone
baldy
laughed
immoderately
that
father
said
he
was
a
railroad
man
who
became
boss
and
at
last
retired
on
a
comfortable
little
sum
in
the
kitchen
where
the
old
people
have
often
fed
me
the
old
man
has
hung
on
the
wall
the
shovel
which
he
had
used
in
his
early
days
there
it
is
to
be
seen
tasselled
and
kept
shining
bright
and
treated
reverently
as
a
family
heirloom
how
i
have
laughed
continued
baldy
to
see
that
shovel
to
think
what
a
simple
old
fellow
he
must
be
to
take
a
pride
in
showing
how
he
toiled
in
his
early
life
every
time
i
go
there
the
old
man
points
at
the
shovel
with
pride
and
i
have
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
keep
a
calm
face
in
listening
to
its
history
but
in
spite
of
all
that
the
old
man
is
a
good
sort
and
i
am
glad
to
have
been
able
to
assist
his
son
alas
what
a
disastrous
end
was
ours
when
we
reached
the
town
of
new
haven
we
began
to
beg
from
passersby
in
the
open
streets
and
in
less
than
an
hour
were
in
jail
on
being
brought
up
next
morning
before
the
judge
we
were
each
sentenced
to
thirty
days
but
what
hurt
our
feelings
most
was
the
personal
comment
of
the
judge
that
we
were
two
brawny
scoundrels
who
would
not
work
if
we
had
the
chance
however
true
this
might
be
as
applied
to
us
in
a
moral
sense
it
certainly
was
not
a
literal
fact
for
we
were
both
small
men
people
who
not
seeing
us
would
read
this
remark
in
the
local
paper
would
be
misled
as
to
our
personal
appearance
i
am
doubtful
whether
any
judge
is
justified
in
using
such
a
term
at
any
rate
thirty
days
had
to
be
served
we
were
in
a
far
better
position
than
an
italian
who
was
waiting
to
be
tried
for
murder
and
whose
cell
was
not
far
distant
from
ours
at
this
jail
we
had
to
perform
the
light
labour
of
caning
chairs
and
were
well
treated
in
the
way
of
food
and
sleeping
accommodation
and
in
addition
received
a
liberal
supply
of
chewing
tobacco
being
interested
in
the
italian
the
first
thing
we
did
on
regaining
our
liberty
was
to
enquire
as
to
his
fate
we
were
told
that
he
had
received
a
life
sentence
or
as
our
alien
informant
strangely
expressed
it
antonia
he
did
get
some
of
de
time
but
he
got
all
of
de
time
thus
what
promised
to
be
a
summer
outing
full
of
enjoyment
came
to
a
disastrous
close
sooner
than
we
expected
and
when
we
were
again
free
the
summer
season
was
practically
over
the
visitors
were
gradually
leaving
for
their
town
houses
which
meant
that
our
treatment
at
the
boarding
houses
would
become
colder
and
colder
in
accordance
with
the
number
of
boarders
at
this
time
i
accepted
employment
as
a
woodchopper
but
unfortunately
the
work
did
not
last
and
just
as
i
began
to
feel
the
inclination
for
this
more
respectable
life
i
was
discharged
much
to
brum
delight
who
was
apparently
disgusted
with
this
new
innovation
called
work
and
could
not
understand
any
man
desire
for
it
chapter
vi
a
night
ride
although
i
had
at
this
time
become
lazy
losing
almost
all
sense
of
respectability
i
often
reproached
brum
for
the
aimlessness
of
this
existence
telling
him
we
must
seek
work
and
attend
to
other
wants
than
those
of
the
body
i
would
tell
him
of
the
arts
and
how
the
cultivation
of
them
was
lost
to
us
through
a
continual
lack
of
funds
i
told
him
of
the
pleasures
of
reading
visiting
picture
galleries
museums
and
theatres
and
of
the
wonders
of
instrumental
music
and
of
the
human
voice
once
when
we
were
passing
through
a
street
in
new
orleans
i
paused
to
listen
to
a
woman
singing
brum
like
the
faithful
companion
he
was
waited
my
pleasure
until
he
too
seemed
to
become
impressed
by
some
unusual
feeling
the
song
ended
and
as
we
went
our
way
i
said
there
brum
what
do
you
think
of
that
o
lor
he
answered
awestruck
was
she
a
blooming
cat
making
me
laugh
heartily
at
such
a
strange
expression
of
praise
knowing
that
it
was
meant
to
be
truthful
and
sincere
having
done
a
few
days
work
as
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
i
resolved
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
brum
at
once
as
to
our
future
plans
with
this
end
in
view
i
invited
him
to
a
drink
and
thus
began
what
do
you
intend
doing
your
life
is
not
mine
we
often
go
for
days
without
reading
matter
and
we
know
not
what
the
world
is
saying
nor
what
the
world
is
doing
the
beauty
of
nature
is
for
ever
before
my
eyes
but
i
am
certainly
not
enriching
my
mind
for
who
can
contemplate
nature
with
any
profit
in
the
presence
of
others
i
have
no
leisure
to
make
notes
in
hopes
of
future
use
and
am
so
overpacking
my
memory
with
all
these
scenes
that
when
their
time
comes
for
use
they
will
not
then
take
definite
shape
i
must
go
to
work
for
some
months
so
that
i
may
live
sparingly
on
my
savings
in
some
large
city
where
i
can
cultivate
my
mind
now
brum
method
of
begging
was
different
in
large
cities
from
what
it
was
in
the
country
in
the
latter
he
found
no
use
for
money
except
for
hair
cutting
or
shaving
and
when
this
became
necessary
he
never
failed
to
get
the
requisite
amount
for
his
purpose
when
he
was
ready
to
have
this
office
performed
it
was
his
custom
to
interview
the
catholic
priest
of
the
community
and
beg
the
use
of
his
razor
knowing
it
was
part
of
that
person
creed
to
shave
continually
of
course
the
priest
would
not
think
of
lending
his
razor
to
an
entire
stranger
but
seldom
refused
the
ten
cents
that
were
necessary
for
that
operation
but
in
the
large
cities
brum
scorned
private
houses
and
begged
money
in
the
streets
and
in
their
various
stores
purchased
his
meals
at
a
restaurant
and
paid
his
lodgings
like
an
honest
man
therefore
thinking
my
discontent
was
mainly
owing
to
the
lack
of
funds
he
said
all
this
haste
from
place
to
place
is
not
at
all
to
my
liking
if
you
wish
to
settle
in
a
large
city
i
can
guarantee
two
dollars
a
day
at
the
least
between
us
for
a
visit
to
the
theatre
music
hall
for
books
papers
or
an
occasional
glass
of
grog
no
no
i
said
we
must
either
work
or
part
there
are
three
dollars
half
of
my
earnings
so
please
yourself
whether
we
work
or
part
whether
you
go
or
stay
for
i
have
already
decided
my
own
course
what
is
it
to
be
well
said
he
after
a
long
pause
we
are
now
near
to
the
hop
country
and
they
start
picking
sometime
next
week
that
is
about
the
only
work
to
be
had
at
this
time
of
the
year
upon
this
we
had
several
drinks
for
i
was
so
pleased
at
decision
that
i
ordered
drink
after
drink
with
bewildering
succession
brum
informed
me
of
a
freight
train
that
was
to
leave
the
yards
at
midnight
on
which
we
could
beat
our
way
to
a
small
town
on
the
borders
of
the
hop
country
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
ourselves
until
that
time
arrived
we
continued
to
drink
until
we
were
not
in
a
fit
condition
for
this
hazardous
undertaking
except
we
were
fortunate
to
get
an
empty
car
so
as
to
lie
down
and
sleep
upon
the
journey
at
last
we
made
our
way
towards
the
yards
where
we
saw
the
men
making
up
the
train
we
kept
out
of
sight
until
that
was
done
and
then
in
the
darkness
brum
inspected
one
side
of
the
train
and
i
the
other
in
quest
of
an
empty
car
in
vain
we
sought
for
that
comfort
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
ride
the
bumpers
or
the
top
of
the
car
exposed
to
the
cold
night
air
we
jumped
the
bumpers
the
engine
whistled
twice
toot
toot
and
we
felt
ourselves
slowly
moving
out
of
the
yards
brum
was
on
one
car
and
i
was
on
the
next
facing
him
never
shall
i
forget
the
horrors
of
that
ride
he
had
taken
fast
hold
on
the
handle
bar
of
his
car
and
i
had
done
likewise
with
mine
we
had
been
riding
some
fifteen
minutes
and
the
train
was
going
at
its
full
speed
when
to
my
horror
i
saw
brum
lurch
forward
and
then
quickly
pull
himself
straight
and
erect
several
times
he
did
this
and
i
shouted
to
him
it
was
no
use
for
the
man
was
drunk
and
fighting
against
the
overpowering
effects
and
it
was
a
mystery
to
me
how
he
kept
his
hold
at
last
he
became
motionless
for
so
long
that
i
knew
the
next
time
he
lurched
forward
his
weight
of
body
must
break
his
hold
and
he
would
fall
under
the
wheels
and
be
cut
to
pieces
i
worked
myself
carefully
towards
him
and
woke
him
although
i
had
great
difficulty
in
waking
him
he
swore
that
he
was
not
asleep
i
had
scarcely
done
this
when
a
lantern
was
shown
from
the
top
of
the
car
and
a
brakesman
voice
hailed
us
hallo
where
are
you
two
going
to
the
hop
fields
i
answered
well
he
sneered
i
guess
you
wo
get
to
them
on
this
train
so
jump
off
at
once
jump
d
hear
he
cried
using
a
great
oath
as
he
saw
we
were
little
inclined
to
obey
brum
was
now
wide
awake
if
you
do
jump
at
once
shouted
this
irate
brakesman
you
will
be
thrown
off
to
jump
said
brum
quietly
will
be
sure
death
and
to
be
thrown
off
will
mean
no
more
wait
until
i
come
back
cried
the
brakesman
and
we
will
see
whether
you
ride
this
train
or
not
on
which
he
left
us
making
his
way
towards
the
caboose
now
said
brum
when
he
returns
we
must
be
on
the
top
of
the
car
for
he
will
probably
bring
with
him
a
coupling
pin
to
strike
us
off
the
bumpers
making
us
fall
under
the
wheels
we
quickly
clambered
on
top
and
in
a
few
minutes
could
see
a
light
approaching
us
moving
along
the
top
of
the
cars
we
were
now
lying
flat
so
that
he
might
not
see
us
until
he
stood
on
the
same
car
he
was
very
near
to
us
when
we
sprang
to
our
feet
and
unexpectedly
gripped
him
one
on
each
side
and
before
he
could
recover
from
his
first
astonishment
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
seen
so
much
fear
on
a
human
face
he
must
have
seen
our
half
drunken
condition
and
at
once
gave
up
all
hopes
of
mercy
from
such
men
for
he
stood
helpless
not
knowing
what
to
do
if
he
struggled
it
would
mean
the
fall
and
death
of
the
three
and
did
he
remain
helpless
in
our
hands
it
might
mean
being
thrown
from
that
height
from
a
car
going
at
the
rate
of
thirty
miles
an
hour
now
said
brum
to
him
what
is
it
to
be
shall
we
ride
this
train
without
interference
or
shall
we
have
a
wrestling
bout
up
here
when
the
first
fall
must
be
our
last
speak
boys
said
he
affecting
a
short
laugh
you
have
the
drop
on
me
you
can
ride
we
watched
him
making
his
way
back
to
the
caboose
which
he
entered
but
every
moment
i
expected
to
see
him
reappear
assisted
by
others
it
might
have
been
that
there
was
some
friction
among
them
and
that
they
would
not
ask
assistance
from
one
another
for
instance
an
engineer
has
to
take
orders
from
the
conductor
but
the
former
is
as
well
paid
if
not
better
than
the
latter
and
the
most
responsibility
is
on
his
shoulders
and
this
often
makes
ill
blood
between
them
at
any
rate
american
tramps
know
well
that
neither
the
engineer
nor
fireman
his
faithful
attendant
will
inform
the
conductor
or
brakesman
of
their
presence
on
a
train
perhaps
the
man
was
ashamed
of
his
and
did
not
care
to
own
his
defeat
to
the
conductor
and
his
fellow
brakesmen
but
whatever
was
the
matter
we
rode
that
train
to
its
destination
and
without
any
more
interference
as
we
neared
the
town
we
saw
a
large
camp
fire
in
a
small
dingle
near
the
track
at
which
a
man
lay
asleep
seeing
this
comfortable
sight
and
being
cold
and
tired
we
made
up
our
minds
to
jump
off
the
train
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
return
to
that
fire
for
a
few
comfort
the
whistle
blew
for
the
station
and
the
train
began
gradually
to
slacken
speed
when
we
jumped
from
the
bumpers
and
our
limbs
being
stiff
we
staggered
and
fell
but
received
no
hurt
it
must
have
been
a
mile
or
more
back
to
that
place
but
we
arrived
there
in
due
time
and
without
waking
its
solitary
occupant
were
soon
stretched
out
fast
asleep
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
when
we
awoke
the
stranger
had
already
been
to
town
had
returned
with
food
and
was
now
making
coffee
in
a
tomato
can
all
of
which
he
generously
offered
to
share
with
us
this
i
gladly
accepted
but
brum
declined
with
thanks
saying
that
he
was
always
capable
of
getting
his
own
meals
and
if
needs
be
could
beg
enough
for
half
a
dozen
others
i
gave
this
stranger
my
entire
confidence
and
soon
learnt
that
he
had
come
to
these
parts
for
the
same
purpose
we
three
said
he
will
work
together
on
the
same
land
and
under
the
one
master
i
am
a
moulder
by
trade
he
continued
and
a
week
ago
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
saved
but
went
on
the
spree
and
am
now
probably
without
a
cent
to
my
surprise
at
this
stage
of
the
narrative
he
unlaced
his
right
boot
and
began
to
feel
in
its
toes
at
the
same
time
shaking
his
head
despondently
after
which
he
put
it
on
again
and
laced
it
yes
he
said
taking
off
his
coat
and
feeling
the
lining
a
week
ago
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
saved
brum
having
now
returned
from
town
laden
with
sandwiches
cakes
and
he
having
had
a
hot
dinner
from
a
convent
we
packed
those
necessaries
for
future
use
and
started
on
foot
for
the
hopfields
every
now
and
then
the
stranger
whom
brum
at
once
called
australian
red
owing
to
his
being
born
in
that
country
and
his
having
a
florid
complexion
would
try
our
patience
extremely
by
sitting
on
fallen
timber
and
taking
off
his
boot
sometimes
the
two
and
after
feeling
in
them
replacing
them
on
his
feet
with
a
sigh
of
disappointment
often
he
would
take
off
his
hat
and
minutely
examine
the
lining
to
our
unfeigned
astonishment
at
one
time
we
lost
patience
with
him
he
had
seen
a
low
stack
of
timber
and
requested
a
few
moments
delay
on
this
being
granted
australian
red
began
to
take
off
his
garments
one
by
one
and
to
examine
them
not
one
article
was
placed
aside
without
having
undergone
a
thorough
scrutiny
until
nothing
but
his
shirt
remained
all
this
waste
of
time
was
very
trying
to
our
patience
and
when
he
was
again
dressed
we
requested
him
at
once
for
all
to
put
a
stop
to
such
manoeuvres
we
walked
on
in
silence
but
had
scarcely
covered
a
short
mile
when
red
was
seen
to
be
preparing
to
strip
for
another
investigation
on
seeing
which
brum
losing
a
little
patience
said
look
here
old
fellow
if
such
is
going
to
be
your
conduct
you
ca
on
no
account
travel
any
further
with
us
for
a
time
australian
red
looked
undecided
and
then
let
his
coat
slip
back
to
its
position
it
is
like
this
he
said
i
am
a
moulder
by
trade
a
week
ago
i
had
a
hundred
dollars
saved
but
where
are
they
now
it
is
always
my
custom
he
continued
when
i
go
on
the
spree
to
secrete
my
money
in
some
safe
place
although
i
have
no
recollection
of
doing
so
i
am
positively
assured
that
such
has
been
the
case
and
would
not
be
surprised
at
any
moment
to
discover
a
twenty
dollar
bill
in
the
lining
of
my
clothes
but
with
regards
to
the
boots
i
am
now
thoroughly
satisfied
when
i
became
better
acquainted
with
australian
red
this
peculiarity
was
often
made
apparent
to
me
perhaps
he
did
secrete
money
for
i
have
oftened
wondered
as
to
where
it
had
vanished
whether
or
not
it
was
certainly
never
to
be
found
on
his
person
and
must
have
been
slipped
under
the
mat
in
strange
places
dropped
into
vases
or
hidden
behind
looking
glasses
in
a
day
or
two
we
reached
the
and
all
three
succeeded
in
being
hired
by
the
same
farmer
this
could
not
have
very
well
been
different
as
neither
one
would
have
otherwise
worked
the
season
if
i
remember
right
lasted
between
three
and
four
weeks
which
we
began
and
finished
but
were
not
very
well
satisfied
with
the
financial
result
our
total
earnings
were
clear
of
all
expenses
about
forty
dollars
and
with
that
amount
we
walked
to
the
nearest
large
town
intending
to
beat
our
way
to
new
york
and
paint
it
a
forty
dollar
red
we
reached
the
said
town
and
made
enquiries
of
a
switchman
as
to
when
the
next
freight
train
would
be
leaving
for
new
york
the
sight
of
a
flask
of
whiskey
in
the
hands
of
australian
red
enlightened
us
considerably
as
to
the
time
of
trains
their
qualification
for
carrying
human
freight
and
the
cruel
or
kind
disposition
of
their
attendant
crews
we
made
choice
of
a
train
leaving
about
dusk
and
finding
an
empty
car
on
a
side
track
we
entered
it
to
wait
as
patiently
as
possible
until
that
time
came
we
were
not
so
quiet
as
we
should
have
been
considering
that
we
were
trespassing
on
the
railroad
and
that
is
why
we
were
soon
startled
by
a
voice
crying
what
are
you
doing
there
do
you
know
that
you
are
trespassing
on
the
railroad
with
that
the
marshal
of
the
town
stood
before
the
open
door
showing
the
star
of
his
authority
on
his
dark
clothes
i
get
any
sleep
day
or
night
through
you
fellows
he
said
consider
yourselves
under
arrest
saying
this
he
marched
us
off
at
the
point
of
a
revolver
and
began
seeking
the
judge
for
our
trial
at
that
strange
hour
of
the
night
chapter
vii
law
in
america
as
he
marched
us
along
he
made
several
enquiries
as
to
our
finances
to
know
if
we
were
prepared
to
pay
a
fine
being
assured
of
this
he
took
a
very
despondent
view
of
our
case
brum
explained
afterwards
when
it
was
too
late
that
trespassing
on
the
railroads
was
always
considered
a
very
serious
offence
during
this
month
of
the
year
when
men
were
returning
with
their
small
earnings
from
the
hopfields
which
were
not
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
travel
as
passengers
he
explained
that
trespassing
on
the
railroad
was
not
only
overlooked
but
was
openly
encouraged
when
men
had
to
pick
hops
to
fill
their
pockets
but
as
soon
as
those
pockets
were
filled
by
picking
hops
the
local
magistrates
lost
no
time
in
giving
the
police
strict
orders
to
fall
to
arrest
and
detain
so
that
a
picker
pocket
might
be
picked
by
them
of
his
little
earnings
the
marshal
stopped
several
citizens
enquiring
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
a
person
named
stevens
to
my
surprise
we
were
not
lodged
for
the
night
in
the
common
jail
but
were
led
into
a
public
house
which
in
that
country
is
referred
to
as
a
saloon
as
we
entered
this
place
and
stood
in
front
of
its
bar
we
did
not
look
much
like
prisoners
brum
called
for
four
drinks
and
the
marshal
drank
his
respect
for
us
in
a
very
friendly
manner
indeed
after
which
he
took
the
landlord
aside
for
a
short
consultation
in
which
i
heard
the
man
stevens
mentioned
more
than
once
then
he
came
back
and
had
another
drink
this
time
at
the
expense
of
australian
red
some
customers
now
arrived
followed
by
a
lean
solemn
looking
person
whom
the
marshal
took
no
time
in
accosting
as
judge
stevens
this
gentleman
at
once
called
for
whiskey
then
looked
from
the
marshal
to
us
and
from
us
to
the
marshal
at
the
same
time
nodding
his
head
approvingly
to
the
latter
the
marshal
cleared
his
throat
and
began
i
found
these
men
trespassing
on
the
railroad
and
at
once
arrested
them
the
judge
again
nodded
his
head
in
approval
to
this
red
burly
individual
who
had
made
a
claim
of
being
robbed
of
his
sleep
day
and
night
and
turning
to
us
said
boys
we
have
to
put
a
stop
to
these
things
drink
and
follow
me
he
led
the
way
into
a
small
back
room
and
we
followed
with
the
marshal
the
citizens
bringing
up
the
rear
the
marshal
gave
evidence
of
our
arrest
making
special
mention
of
our
possession
of
money
the
judge
wished
to
be
informed
of
the
exact
amount
and
being
told
that
it
was
something
like
ten
dollars
each
summed
up
the
case
at
once
boys
he
said
i
fine
you
each
five
dollars
in
default
of
which
you
must
go
to
syracuse
for
thirty
days
at
which
place
was
the
county
jail
now
i
was
always
outspoken
and
was
never
forced
by
fear
under
any
circumstances
to
conceal
my
thoughts
which
if
i
saw
real
injustice
or
hypocrisy
would
be
blurted
out
in
a
more
dignified
court
than
this
this
mock
trial
which
at
first
had
been
highly
amusing
exasperated
when
it
came
to
paying
half
of
my
hard
earnings
so
i
told
this
judge
plainly
that
my
friends
might
please
themselves
but
that
he
would
not
get
one
cent
out
of
me
brum
supported
me
in
this
but
australian
red
began
to
finger
his
dollars
whereat
the
marshal
quickly
snatched
them
out
of
his
hand
deducted
five
dollars
which
he
gave
to
the
judge
and
returned
the
rest
judge
stevens
looked
at
us
steadily
for
a
time
and
then
asked
this
astounding
question
boys
how
much
are
you
prepared
to
pay
brum
who
had
very
little
sense
of
justice
and
being
such
a
good
beggar
set
very
little
value
on
money
asked
the
judge
if
he
would
accept
three
dollars
from
each
of
us
if
i
had
been
alone
at
this
time
i
would
have
paid
nothing
but
to
save
brum
from
going
to
prison
who
i
knew
would
support
me
through
all
i
satisfied
myself
that
if
the
judge
approved
of
this
amount
i
would
pay
it
without
further
comment
the
judge
appeared
to
weigh
the
matter
seriously
and
then
cried
with
a
magnanimity
that
was
irresistible
pass
over
the
dollars
boys
you
shall
have
a
chance
this
time
the
trial
was
not
here
ended
as
most
of
us
believed
a
citizen
who
had
been
an
interested
spectator
of
this
scene
and
who
had
been
fidgetting
in
his
seat
for
some
time
now
rose
to
his
feet
and
said
where
is
the
justice
of
this
these
men
are
all
guilty
of
the
same
offence
and
yet
one
is
fined
five
dollars
and
the
other
two
get
off
more
leniently
with
the
loss
of
three
dollars
each
this
certainly
can
not
be
called
justice
at
this
the
judge
showed
the
first
signs
of
passion
sir
he
shouted
in
wrath
who
is
the
judge
i
or
you
if
you
ever
again
interfere
with
our
proceedings
in
this
manner
i
shall
fine
you
for
contempt
of
court
contempt
of
court
sir
contempt
of
court
this
citizen
and
lover
of
justice
collapsed
stricken
with
awe
bluffed
and
discouraged
come
boys
said
the
judge
and
he
led
the
way
back
to
the
bar
there
he
produced
a
two
dollar
bill
which
was
part
of
our
fine
and
called
for
drinks
for
the
house
we
followed
his
example
late
prisoners
and
citizens
and
were
all
happy
together
until
a
late
hour
the
marshal
who
seemed
to
have
a
little
respect
for
me
for
having
shown
the
spirit
of
free
speech
before
the
judge
took
me
aside
and
asked
whether
we
intended
to
take
advantage
of
the
invitation
given
by
the
citizen
who
had
been
threatened
for
contempt
of
court
to
spend
the
night
at
his
house
i
do
think
so
i
said
we
have
had
enough
of
this
town
and
intend
leaving
it
shortly
after
these
words
we
left
the
saloon
but
had
scarcely
reached
the
street
end
when
i
heard
steps
following
and
to
my
surprise
the
marshal
was
soon
at
our
side
now
comes
the
most
extraordinary
part
of
this
story
which
i
have
often
been
diffident
in
relating
thinking
it
would
not
be
credited
boys
said
this
burly
fellow
who
could
not
get
any
sleep
day
or
night
get
you
to
the
railroad
and
if
any
one
interferes
with
you
tell
them
that
the
marshal
sent
you
i
shall
be
with
you
in
about
twenty
minutes
we
were
soon
at
the
railroad
were
not
interfered
with
and
the
marshal
followed
in
a
short
time
listen
he
said
to
us
who
were
again
trespassers
on
the
railroad
at
his
pleasure
and
instigation
there
is
a
train
already
made
up
to
start
in
five
minutes
time
get
into
this
empty
car
and
by
heavens
no
man
shall
interfere
with
you
which
we
did
and
when
the
train
started
the
marshal
was
there
beside
the
car
wishing
us
a
pleasant
why
said
brum
when
i
commented
in
astonishment
at
all
this
it
is
nothing
unusual
one
day
he
began
i
was
in
a
small
town
in
ohio
seeing
a
freight
train
leaving
the
station
i
leaped
into
an
empty
car
just
as
the
train
started
when
safe
inside
i
turned
and
stood
in
the
open
doorway
and
looking
out
saw
the
marshal
standing
on
the
platform
looking
after
me
so
i
waved
him
a
sarcastic
farewell
but
the
train
instead
of
increasing
in
speed
began
to
slow
and
coming
to
a
standstill
began
at
once
to
back
towards
the
station
before
i
could
decide
on
my
course
of
action
we
were
again
standing
in
front
of
the
station
with
my
car
facing
the
marshal
who
seemed
to
have
waited
expecting
this
to
happen
he
cried
out
of
that
for
you
are
under
arrest
i
was
lodged
in
jail
and
was
next
morning
brought
up
for
trial
the
marshal
gave
evidence
as
to
seeing
me
jump
the
train
and
i
was
charged
with
that
offence
having
no
money
i
was
about
to
be
sent
to
jail
when
the
judge
asked
the
marshal
to
examine
my
hands
which
although
i
had
done
no
work
for
a
number
of
years
were
still
hard
and
horny
i
said
that
i
was
a
seafaring
man
and
exhibited
pictures
of
boats
and
anchors
tattooed
on
my
arms
at
the
same
time
offering
to
show
the
in
full
sail
across
my
breast
my
strange
calling
in
that
inland
town
more
than
a
thousand
miles
from
the
coast
appeared
to
greatly
interest
the
judge
who
after
several
friendly
questions
discharged
me
with
a
caution
instead
of
at
once
taking
advantage
of
my
freedom
i
sat
down
waiting
the
end
of
the
court
another
prisoner
was
then
brought
up
who
had
been
seen
loafing
on
the
station
platform
all
the
previous
day
this
prisoner
pleaded
guilty
and
said
that
he
had
waited
in
vain
for
hours
for
a
freight
train
to
carry
him
to
his
destination
he
having
no
money
to
pay
his
fare
as
a
passenger
hold
cried
the
marshal
that
is
a
lie
for
i
myself
saw
a
train
steaming
out
when
you
were
loafing
indifferently
on
the
platform
ten
dollars
or
sixty
days
said
the
judge
this
will
show
you
how
one
prisoner
was
charged
for
stealing
a
ride
on
a
freight
train
and
another
prisoner
was
charged
for
not
doing
so
as
the
opportunity
occurred
happening
in
the
same
court
and
under
the
same
judge
again
continued
brum
i
know
a
prisoner
in
an
adjoining
state
who
was
sentenced
to
ten
years
for
embezzlement
the
money
was
never
recovered
and
he
probably
has
it
safe
until
his
time
expires
this
prisoner
is
receiving
a
salary
of
ten
dollars
a
week
for
keeping
the
prison
books
is
allowed
to
converse
with
any
one
and
is
entrusted
to
go
the
rounds
of
the
turnkey
he
is
the
one
man
allowed
to
wear
private
clothes
and
is
even
allowed
at
night
the
liberty
of
a
stroll
in
the
open
air
and
unattended
with
the
one
stipulation
that
he
returns
before
a
certain
hour
at
night
and
continued
brum
what
with
the
money
he
has
concealed
held
probably
by
a
relative
and
his
weekly
salary
of
ten
dollars
as
the
bookkeeper
of
the
prison
he
will
never
need
work
more
after
his
sentence
is
served
but
listen
to
me
continued
brum
more
earnestly
some
of
these
queer
laws
are
to
a
tramp
advantage
the
winter
is
already
here
and
promises
to
be
a
most
severe
one
now
if
you
would
like
to
rest
and
grow
fat
during
the
coldest
months
come
with
me
to
michigan
you
can
there
enter
jails
without
committing
offence
of
any
kind
and
take
ten
fifteen
twenty
or
thirty
days
all
at
your
own
sweet
discretion
no
work
to
do
good
food
to
be
had
and
tobacco
daily
supplied
there
is
nothing
else
but
begging
before
you
for
the
coming
winter
said
brum
warming
to
his
subject
but
if
you
like
to
enter
with
me
those
blessed
havens
of
rest
where
one
can
play
cards
smoke
or
read
the
time
away
you
will
become
strong
and
ready
for
work
when
the
spring
of
the
year
arrives
this
project
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
very
attractive
for
one
thing
it
was
a
long
journey
to
that
part
of
the
country
and
the
weather
being
cold
we
were
forced
to
travel
at
night
and
sleep
in
the
day
i
was
certainly
not
a
very
pleasant
companion
at
this
time
being
occupied
so
much
with
my
own
dreams
which
ever
took
the
one
shape
of
a
small
comfortable
room
with
a
cosy
fire
books
papers
tobacco
with
reading
and
writing
in
turns
at
any
rate
we
decided
to
follow
brum
suggestion
and
instead
of
going
to
new
york
we
got
off
and
took
another
road
we
had
a
rough
time
in
beating
our
way
to
michigan
we
were
marched
out
of
one
town
by
the
marshal
where
we
were
waiting
to
catch
a
train
this
necessitated
us
either
to
walk
three
miles
to
catch
a
train
as
it
was
on
a
grade
or
to
walk
ten
miles
to
the
next
watering
tank
where
all
freight
trains
stopped
we
decided
on
doing
the
former
to
do
this
required
an
activity
of
which
i
hardly
thought
brum
to
be
capable
the
grade
was
long
and
before
the
train
reached
the
top
its
speed
would
be
slackened
to
about
ten
miles
an
hour
or
less
if
it
had
heavy
freight
it
was
necessary
to
lie
low
and
out
of
sight
until
the
train
appeared
and
then
run
beside
it
so
as
to
leap
and
catch
the
handle
bar
the
feet
at
the
same
time
catching
the
iron
step
after
doing
which
we
could
step
on
to
the
bumpers
or
climb
the
ladder
to
the
top
of
the
car
if
either
the
hand
or
foot
failed
to
do
its
duty
it
meant
a
fall
and
a
very
serious
accident
or
death
i
was
the
youngest
and
most
active
and
leapt
the
first
part
of
the
train
as
soon
as
i
was
safe
i
looked
around
the
car
and
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
australian
red
succeed
just
three
cars
behind
and
brum
succeeding
on
the
next
car
to
him
when
we
reached
the
next
stopping
place
we
all
got
together
on
the
same
car
so
as
to
be
prepared
for
any
trouble
with
the
train
crew
a
brakesman
passed
over
the
top
and
shouted
to
us
in
a
friendly
manner
passed
and
several
times
before
the
train
reached
its
destination
but
treated
our
presence
with
the
utmost
indifference
which
is
often
the
case
in
that
part
of
america
what
a
difference
it
made
in
our
feeling
this
changing
of
seasons
it
seemed
but
a
few
days
ago
the
birds
were
singing
the
orchards
were
heavy
and
mellow
with
fruit
and
we
could
sleep
in
the
open
air
all
night
it
was
now
necessary
to
light
great
fires
when
the
front
parts
of
our
bodies
burned
whilst
a
cold
chill
crept
up
and
down
the
spine
and
the
first
fall
of
snow
which
was
likely
to
occur
at
any
time
would
soon
make
it
difficult
to
enjoy
even
this
small
comfort
at
last
we
reached
a
small
town
in
michigan
which
brum
informed
us
was
the
county
town
and
which
said
he
chuckling
with
delight
had
an
exceedingly
pleasant
jail
chapter
viii
a
prisoner
his
own
judge
now
said
brum
as
the
freight
train
steamed
into
the
town
and
came
to
a
standstill
we
must
see
the
marshal
with
this
end
in
view
we
walked
towards
the
passenger
depot
which
brum
informed
us
was
visited
by
the
marshal
several
times
a
day
so
that
he
might
the
better
accost
such
tramps
as
were
going
through
that
town
we
arrived
at
that
place
and
stamped
up
and
down
the
platform
to
circulate
our
blood
for
it
was
now
snowing
heavily
and
the
wind
blowing
in
small
gusts
that
discovered
us
shelter
wherever
we
would
how
the
snow
falls
in
the
north
flake
on
flake
falling
incessantly
until
the
small
dingles
are
almost
on
a
level
with
the
uplands
it
throws
itself
on
the
leaves
of
autumn
and
holds
them
down
in
security
from
the
strongest
winds
it
piles
great
banks
against
people
doors
and
mothers
and
daughters
are
made
prisoners
to
their
own
hearths
until
fathers
and
sons
set
to
and
cut
a
path
to
the
open
thoroughfare
special
snow
trains
are
at
work
clearing
the
track
to
make
the
way
easier
for
passenger
trains
and
freight
trains
that
run
on
passenger
lines
being
loaded
with
cattle
or
other
perishable
goods
whilst
other
freight
is
often
delayed
for
days
and
sometimes
weeks
we
had
been
here
some
fifteen
minutes
when
we
saw
the
marshal
coming
down
the
road
leading
to
the
station
the
bright
star
of
his
authority
being
seen
distinctly
on
his
breast
now
said
brum
let
me
be
the
spokesman
and
i
will
arrange
for
a
month
comfort
by
this
time
the
marshal
stood
before
us
boys
he
began
cold
weather
for
travelling
eh
we
do
feel
the
cold
was
brum
reply
you
will
though
said
the
marshal
this
is
but
the
beginning
and
there
is
a
long
and
severe
winter
before
you
without
a
break
you
would
certainly
be
better
off
in
jail
sixty
days
in
our
jail
which
is
considered
one
of
the
best
if
not
the
best
in
michigan
would
do
you
no
harm
i
assure
you
as
for
that
said
brum
we
might
take
thirty
days
each
providing
of
course
that
you
made
it
worth
while
what
about
tobacco
and
a
drink
or
two
of
whiskey
that
be
all
right
said
the
marshal
here
half
a
dollar
for
a
drink
and
the
sheriff
will
supply
your
tobacco
no
no
objected
brum
give
us
a
dollar
and
three
cakes
of
tobacco
and
we
will
take
thirty
days
and
remember
not
a
day
over
the
marshal
produced
the
three
cakes
of
tobacco
seeming
to
be
well
prepared
for
these
demands
and
giving
us
a
paper
dollar
requested
us
to
go
to
donovan
saloon
which
we
would
find
in
the
main
street
where
he
would
see
us
later
in
the
day
when
of
course
he
added
winking
you
will
be
supposed
to
be
just
a
bit
merry
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
i
asked
brum
as
we
went
our
way
to
donovan
saloon
it
simply
means
this
he
said
that
the
marshal
gets
a
dollar
each
for
every
arrest
he
makes
in
our
case
three
dollars
the
judge
receives
three
or
four
dollars
for
every
conviction
and
the
sheriff
of
the
jail
is
paid
a
dollar
a
day
for
boarding
each
prisoner
under
his
charge
we
benefit
by
a
good
rest
warmth
good
food
and
plenty
of
sleep
and
the
innocent
citizens
have
to
pay
for
it
all
we
had
not
much
difficulty
in
finding
donovan
saloon
which
we
entered
and
called
for
whiskey
it
so
happened
that
two
strangers
were
there
who
had
made
a
considerable
stake
in
the
backwoods
and
had
come
to
this
town
to
squander
their
earnings
we
therefore
came
into
many
a
free
drink
through
the
liberality
of
these
men
about
an
hour
and
a
half
had
elapsed
when
we
discovered
ourselves
to
be
alone
in
the
bar
and
without
means
of
procuring
more
liquor
we
had
better
be
going
said
brum
and
we
passed
into
the
street
brum
saw
the
marshal
coming
up
the
road
and
began
singing
in
a
lusty
voice
to
the
astonishment
of
some
of
the
storekeepers
australian
red
being
the
worse
for
drink
and
forgetting
that
we
had
only
to
feign
this
part
began
to
roar
like
a
bull
merry
in
earnest
on
this
the
marshal
quickly
crossed
the
street
and
in
the
hearing
of
several
citizens
shouted
in
an
authoritative
voice
i
arrest
you
for
being
drunk
and
disorderly
and
we
followed
him
like
lambs
we
were
then
led
to
the
sheriff
house
adjoining
the
jail
that
gentleman
being
in
received
us
with
open
arms
saying
welcome
boys
you
want
thirty
days
and
thirty
you
shall
have
no
more
or
less
and
you
will
be
none
the
worse
for
it
i
promise
you
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
then
made
a
few
casual
items
in
a
large
book
roughly
descriptive
of
our
weight
height
and
personal
appearance
and
then
led
the
way
through
two
or
three
corridors
until
we
were
confronted
by
a
large
iron
door
this
he
opened
with
an
iron
key
and
we
were
ushered
into
a
large
room
where
were
assembled
between
thirty
or
forty
prisoners
some
were
reading
some
were
pacing
to
and
fro
and
several
batches
of
them
were
playing
cards
what
a
reception
we
had
bringing
in
a
fresh
supply
of
information
from
the
outside
have
you
seen
detroit
fatty
asked
one
or
the
saginaw
kid
asked
another
or
chicago
slim
asked
another
brum
who
seemed
to
know
these
wonderful
persons
answered
according
to
his
knowledge
in
this
large
room
for
the
common
use
of
the
prisoners
were
twenty
or
more
cells
to
which
they
retired
for
sleep
but
were
never
locked
in
except
maybe
an
occasional
prisoner
who
might
be
waiting
trial
under
a
charge
of
grand
larceny
manslaughter
or
murder
supper
was
soon
brought
in
and
it
was
a
good
substantial
meal
its
quantity
seemed
to
be
more
than
idle
men
needed
if
they
had
three
such
meals
every
day
and
its
quality
would
satisfy
me
in
any
position
in
life
what
a
pleasure
it
was
that
night
to
be
in
warmth
and
with
our
minds
eased
of
a
month
anxiety
what
time
are
you
going
to
do
asked
one
thirty
days
answered
brum
plenty
said
the
other
there
is
more
jails
than
this
and
not
much
difference
in
them
and
to
go
out
in
the
cold
for
a
day
or
two
makes
us
better
appreciate
the
warmth
and
comfort
within
next
morning
we
were
taken
by
the
sheriff
to
the
where
a
number
of
town
people
were
assembled
owing
to
the
more
interesting
trial
of
a
local
man
i
have
often
thought
with
amusement
of
this
scene
despite
the
judge
severe
expression
and
his
solemn
deliberate
utterance
we
knew
what
to
expect
thirty
days
no
more
or
less
the
sheriff
whispered
to
the
judge
and
the
judge
nodded
sagely
at
the
same
time
casting
his
eyes
in
our
direction
we
were
charged
with
being
drunk
and
disorderly
and
with
disturbing
the
public
peace
he
did
not
see
he
said
why
peaceable
citizens
should
be
disturbed
in
this
way
by
drunken
strangers
and
would
fine
us
seven
dollars
and
costs
in
default
of
which
we
would
be
lodged
in
the
county
jail
for
thirty
days
we
were
then
led
back
by
the
sheriff
and
when
we
were
again
among
the
prisoners
they
seemed
to
express
very
little
curiosity
as
to
our
sentences
knowing
it
was
our
wish
that
we
should
receive
thirty
days
and
that
the
judge
was
at
our
pleasure
we
being
in
fact
our
own
judges
every
morning
the
sheriff
required
half
a
dozen
prisoners
to
sweep
and
clean
the
which
was
situated
about
half
a
mile
from
the
jail
australian
red
and
myself
went
with
him
several
mornings
for
a
little
fresh
air
but
prisoners
could
please
themselves
and
brum
i
know
never
left
the
jail
during
the
whole
thirty
days
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
any
prisoner
could
discharge
himself
on
these
occasions
if
inclined
without
any
fear
of
capture
the
marshal
and
the
judge
had
had
their
dollars
for
arrest
and
conviction
and
i
suppose
the
sheriff
charged
for
board
and
lodging
without
mention
of
a
prisoner
escape
perhaps
they
were
afraid
of
bringing
back
an
escaped
prisoner
for
fear
he
might
make
some
awkward
disclosures
at
any
rate
liberty
could
be
had
by
a
very
deliberate
walk
and
there
was
certainly
no
need
to
make
a
desperate
dash
for
it
of
course
there
was
no
reason
why
any
prisoner
should
seek
to
escape
these
conditions
which
were
of
his
own
seeking
and
which
during
this
unpleasant
time
of
the
year
could
not
in
any
way
be
bettered
by
homeless
men
after
serving
our
sentence
and
the
sheriff
exacting
a
promise
from
us
to
return
again
that
winter
if
not
the
following
we
sought
another
jail
some
twenty
miles
from
the
last
which
prisoners
had
spoken
highly
of
we
were
told
that
there
was
no
necessity
at
this
place
of
going
through
the
form
of
an
arrest
but
that
we
could
go
straight
in
out
of
the
cold
the
sheriff
would
at
once
receive
us
at
his
house
learn
our
wants
while
the
judge
would
attend
to
us
on
the
following
morning
we
arrived
at
this
place
and
everything
turned
out
as
described
the
jail
was
no
different
from
the
other
we
were
catered
for
as
customers
that
would
if
treated
with
courtesy
and
good
living
return
winter
after
winter
and
patronise
this
place
in
preference
to
visiting
the
more
congenial
climate
of
the
south
at
this
place
we
sentenced
ourselves
to
another
thirty
days
our
room
like
the
other
was
a
large
iron
cage
in
which
were
cells
in
a
double
row
main
floor
and
gallery
like
little
cages
within
it
as
we
entered
this
large
cage
the
sheriff
opening
the
iron
door
a
number
of
were
singing
merrily
not
for
liberty
but
enjoying
such
captivity
there
was
only
one
real
prisoner
here
who
was
waiting
trial
under
a
charge
of
manslaughter
and
he
was
the
one
prisoner
to
be
locked
in
his
cell
at
night
and
in
that
cell
had
waited
trial
a
most
cold
blooded
murderer
here
we
had
the
usual
amusements
of
card
playing
singing
and
relating
experiences
the
real
prisoner
for
none
of
the
others
had
been
guilty
of
any
offence
having
entered
of
their
own
free
will
was
very
unfortunate
in
having
a
pair
of
wags
quartered
in
the
cell
above
him
these
two
practical
jokers
made
a
figure
of
their
bed
clothes
and
letting
it
down
dangled
it
in
front
of
this
prisoner
cell
the
poor
wretch
happening
to
be
awake
and
thinking
this
was
bill
henderson
murderer
and
late
occupant
of
the
cell
come
to
haunt
him
leaped
from
his
bed
crying
with
a
voice
bill
henderson
by
god
before
he
could
recover
from
his
fear
and
make
a
more
calm
investigation
the
figure
was
withdrawn
all
this
happened
as
expected
and
the
prisoners
were
delighted
for
they
had
been
hinting
all
day
about
bill
henderson
ghost
so
that
it
might
take
hold
of
this
poor
nerves
once
only
during
the
night
was
this
accomplished
so
that
their
victim
might
have
no
suspicion
as
to
its
being
a
genuine
ghost
every
time
the
sheriff
appeared
the
prisoner
complained
to
him
of
this
ghost
murderer
pleading
for
a
removal
or
an
early
trial
that
gentleman
invariably
listened
with
a
sarcastic
smile
seeming
to
have
some
notion
of
the
truth
by
glancing
at
the
faces
of
the
other
prisoners
how
these
sheriffs
marshals
and
constables
despise
cowardice
and
how
they
respect
the
intrepidity
of
dangerous
men
many
a
sheriff
i
believe
has
surrendered
his
prison
keys
to
the
lynchers
and
the
lawless
mobs
forgetting
his
duty
in
disgust
at
the
exhibition
of
fear
in
one
for
whom
he
is
responsible
and
many
a
sheriff
would
lay
down
his
life
to
protect
a
criminal
who
with
cool
nerve
faces
his
cell
callous
and
indifferent
we
visited
and
were
entertained
in
several
jails
during
this
winter
and
emerged
from
the
last
in
the
middle
of
april
i
have
heard
since
that
this
system
of
boodle
as
it
was
called
was
in
the
following
winter
entirely
squashed
a
sheriff
it
seemed
being
of
an
avaricious
disposition
had
interfered
with
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
prisoners
rations
therefore
when
respectable
citizens
visited
the
jail
to
speak
a
few
sympathetic
words
to
the
prisoners
which
they
usually
did
on
sunday
those
discontented
complained
of
insufficient
picking
and
informed
the
citizens
that
they
had
been
guilty
of
no
offence
that
they
had
entered
the
jail
through
being
promised
enjoyment
and
that
those
expectations
had
not
been
realised
on
hearing
this
the
citizens
formed
a
committee
and
soon
discovered
the
whole
system
to
be
rotten
seeing
how
they
had
been
robbed
they
deposed
several
officers
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
travellers
never
again
visited
that
part
of
america
in
quest
of
comfortable
jails
for
a
day
or
two
the
least
exertion
tired
us
owing
to
our
inactivity
but
take
it
all
in
all
we
were
certainly
in
good
bodily
condition
it
was
now
that
australian
red
made
his
first
proposal
he
knew
a
fruit
farm
where
he
had
been
previously
employed
in
this
very
state
said
he
on
the
shores
of
lake
michigan
how
long
does
the
work
last
i
asked
all
the
summer
he
answered
and
good
pay
for
an
active
man
all
right
i
said
if
i
can
make
a
pretty
fair
stake
i
shall
then
return
to
england
and
home
brum
agreeing
to
this
we
lit
a
fire
that
evening
near
a
water
tank
intending
to
take
the
first
freight
train
that
came
our
way
when
the
train
arrived
we
still
dallied
at
the
fire
which
was
a
considerable
distance
from
the
track
it
whistled
before
we
expected
and
began
its
journey
break
away
cried
australian
red
making
a
rush
for
the
departing
train
the
speed
of
the
train
was
increasing
and
when
i
reached
its
side
i
was
almost
afraid
to
attempt
to
board
it
australian
red
succeeded
but
when
we
reached
the
next
stopping
place
we
were
greatly
disappointed
to
find
that
brum
had
been
left
behind
we
got
off
and
waited
the
arrival
of
other
trains
thinking
that
he
would
soon
follow
us
but
as
brum
did
not
appear
on
any
of
them
we
continued
our
journey
thinking
to
see
him
later
i
never
saw
him
again
he
had
complained
of
the
year
not
being
sufficiently
aired
for
freedom
and
had
proposed
another
short
term
in
jail
no
doubt
after
losing
us
he
had
done
this
chapter
ix
berry
picking
we
reached
the
fruit
country
a
week
or
two
before
picking
commenced
but
although
we
were
in
advance
of
time
and
without
a
cent
the
generosity
of
the
farmers
supplied
all
our
wants
the
authorities
did
not
in
the
least
interfere
with
us
though
we
lit
large
camp
fires
on
the
outskirts
of
the
towns
took
possession
of
hay
ricks
and
empty
and
loafed
for
hours
in
their
principal
streets
they
knew
well
that
the
assistance
of
every
man
would
be
needed
to
strip
the
vines
of
their
berries
which
promised
a
supply
exceeding
that
of
former
years
friday
morning
it
being
generally
known
that
picking
was
to
commence
on
the
following
tuesday
australian
red
remarked
that
it
was
now
time
to
interview
the
farmer
for
whom
he
had
previously
worked
with
this
object
in
view
we
left
the
pretty
inland
port
of
joseph
and
strolling
leisurely
we
reached
that
farm
in
two
hours
it
being
only
five
miles
from
the
town
the
farmer
and
his
wife
who
employed
several
servants
of
both
sexes
but
were
without
children
of
their
own
at
once
recognised
australian
red
and
gave
him
a
kindly
welcome
which
spoke
well
for
red
gentlemanly
behaviour
in
the
past
the
old
man
told
him
in
his
bad
english
that
there
would
always
be
plenty
of
work
for
red
and
for
others
whom
he
might
bring
with
him
i
was
about
years
of
age
at
this
time
appeared
much
younger
and
not
in
any
way
looking
like
a
dangerous
youth
was
soon
on
the
best
of
terms
with
the
old
people
so
much
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
summer
when
the
pickers
were
leaving
the
result
being
as
satisfactory
to
themselves
as
to
the
farmer
the
kind
old
couple
inveigled
me
into
a
private
place
and
proposed
to
adopt
me
as
their
own
son
and
that
they
would
teach
me
how
to
run
the
farm
which
they
said
would
become
mine
at
their
death
the
only
way
to
answer
these
kind
people
was
to
say
that
i
already
had
a
good
home
and
parents
living
in
england
and
that
i
intended
to
return
there
with
the
profits
of
this
summer
work
the
earliest
fruit
was
the
strawberries
whose
vines
grew
from
six
inches
to
a
foot
above
the
ground
we
knelt
in
the
hot
blazing
sun
which
beat
so
powerfully
on
our
bended
necks
that
the
flesh
became
in
a
day
or
two
the
dark
colour
of
walnut
stain
the
soil
being
dry
and
sandy
burned
through
the
clothing
until
our
knees
were
covered
with
a
rash
the
effect
of
this
extreme
heat
often
affected
reasons
and
sometimes
killed
them
outright
berry
picking
in
the
south
has
other
dangers
of
a
worse
kind
i
shall
never
forget
seeing
a
man
leap
screaming
to
his
feet
at
the
same
time
wringing
his
right
hand
in
agony
he
had
parted
the
thick
vines
in
quest
of
the
berries
that
were
concealed
under
the
leaves
and
in
doing
so
had
disturbed
a
deadly
snake
which
had
bitten
his
offending
hand
the
snake
was
very
small
but
far
more
deadly
than
many
others
of
twenty
times
its
length
and
weight
several
deaths
occurred
this
way
in
my
berry
picking
experience
in
the
south
there
was
not
much
fear
of
this
happening
in
the
state
of
michigan
but
we
often
wished
we
could
crawl
under
the
low
green
leaves
of
the
vine
to
escape
for
a
time
the
rays
of
the
sun
the
farm
extended
to
the
shores
of
the
lake
and
when
our
day
work
was
at
an
end
we
hastened
there
and
plunged
into
the
cold
and
unsalted
water
which
never
grew
warm
and
could
be
swallowed
with
impunity
after
which
we
would
return
cook
supper
in
the
open
air
and
wrapping
ourselves
in
blankets
lie
all
night
under
the
thick
foliage
of
a
tree
the
berries
were
sent
every
night
to
chicago
for
the
morrow
market
but
there
being
no
market
on
sunday
our
day
of
rest
was
saturday
and
we
picked
on
sunday
for
monday
market
early
every
saturday
morning
australian
red
would
go
to
town
in
the
buggy
and
return
to
us
later
in
the
day
with
papers
tobacco
matches
and
such
provisions
as
we
needed
for
eggs
butter
milk
potatoes
and
fruit
could
be
had
of
the
farmer
the
latter
delicacy
being
free
for
the
trouble
of
picking
red
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
man
above
the
average
intelligence
and
as
far
as
my
knowledge
went
seldom
made
an
error
in
grammar
or
the
pronunciation
of
words
but
that
he
should
think
words
required
a
different
pronunciation
in
reading
from
what
they
did
in
speaking
was
a
great
shock
to
me
and
made
some
of
his
most
illiterate
hearers
look
from
one
to
another
with
stupefaction
now
i
was
always
greatly
interested
in
fights
and
glove
contests
and
red
claiming
to
have
personal
acquaintance
with
the
best
of
australia
and
himself
claiming
to
be
an
amateur
middle
weight
whose
prowess
many
a
professional
had
envied
often
entertained
me
with
little
anecdotes
of
them
which
had
escaped
the
notice
of
sporting
papers
so
on
the
first
saturday
of
our
picking
red
returned
from
town
with
a
paper
which
gave
a
full
and
graphic
account
round
by
round
of
a
contest
for
the
light
weight
championship
of
the
world
the
principals
hailing
respectively
from
australia
and
america
red
sympathies
of
course
were
with
the
former
who
to
his
elation
had
defeated
his
opponent
being
a
very
modest
man
australian
red
had
always
quietly
perused
his
paper
making
few
comments
so
as
to
avoid
all
argument
but
on
this
occasion
he
opened
his
paper
and
began
to
read
with
a
boldness
that
astonished
me
but
what
surprised
me
most
was
the
way
in
which
he
made
use
of
an
expletive
syllable
which
sounded
so
quaint
as
to
make
laughter
irresistible
for
instance
this
passage
occurred
in
describing
the
fifth
round
after
he
was
knocked
down
he
picked
himself
up
painfully
and
the
blood
flowed
from
his
nostrils
in
copious
streams
i
could
not
help
laughing
out
at
his
strange
delivery
and
red
thinking
my
sympathies
were
with
the
bruiser
from
the
antipodes
chuckled
with
a
real
but
more
quiet
delight
we
had
enough
food
for
conversation
that
day
in
commenting
on
this
contest
i
like
to
see
a
good
scientific
bout
by
men
who
know
the
use
of
their
hands
but
would
rather
walk
twenty
miles
than
see
animals
in
strife
although
of
a
quiet
disposition
my
fondness
for
animals
is
likely
at
any
time
to
lead
me
into
danger
after
reading
cases
of
vivisection
i
have
often
had
dreams
of
boldly
entering
such
places
routing
the
doctors
with
a
bar
of
iron
cutting
the
cords
and
freeing
the
animals
despite
of
any
hurt
i
might
receive
from
bites
and
scratches
perhaps
i
should
cut
a
ridiculous
figure
walking
through
the
crowded
streets
with
a
poor
meek
creature
under
each
arm
but
that
would
not
bother
me
much
in
the
performance
of
a
humane
action
after
a
good
month
work
at
the
strawberries
we
had
three
weeks
at
picking
raspberries
followed
by
four
weeks
blackberry
picking
there
was
good
money
to
be
made
at
the
strawberries
but
much
less
at
the
raspberries
the
blackberry
picking
was
as
lucrative
as
the
strawberry
and
being
cultivated
on
the
low
bushes
that
seldom
required
us
to
stoop
was
not
such
a
tedious
occupation
as
the
latter
whose
vines
were
often
half
buried
in
the
soil
after
paying
all
expenses
i
had
at
the
end
of
the
season
cleared
over
a
hundred
dollars
it
was
now
the
last
of
the
picking
and
the
farmer
paid
us
off
he
was
a
german
and
nearly
all
the
farmers
in
that
part
of
the
country
were
the
same
or
of
that
descent
and
they
used
the
german
language
at
every
opportunity
and
never
used
english
except
when
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
you
vos
come
again
next
summer
said
he
to
australian
red
and
myself
as
we
were
leaving
for
i
know
you
two
plenty
this
remark
made
me
blush
for
it
seemed
as
much
as
to
say
that
his
knowledge
of
us
was
more
than
he
desired
but
we
understood
his
meaning
he
offered
to
drive
us
to
joseph
but
we
preferred
to
walk
as
we
had
all
day
and
half
the
night
to
wait
before
the
boat
started
from
that
place
to
chicago
now
i
said
to
australian
red
as
we
jogged
along
i
am
going
to
hoard
the
bulk
of
my
dollars
and
shall
just
keep
two
or
three
handy
for
food
and
incidental
expenses
for
i
am
now
about
to
beat
my
way
from
chicago
to
new
york
from
the
latter
place
i
shall
pay
my
passage
to
liverpool
clothe
myself
better
and
then
take
train
for
south
wales
and
still
have
a
pound
or
two
left
when
i
arrive
home
come
and
have
a
drink
said
red
and
i
will
then
inform
you
how
any
man
without
former
experience
on
sea
or
ship
neither
being
a
sailor
fireman
or
cook
can
not
only
work
his
passage
to
england
but
be
paid
for
doing
so
we
had
had
no
intoxicating
liquor
for
several
months
and
though
we
had
passed
one
or
two
of
these
places
on
our
way
to
joseph
on
which
he
had
gazed
in
a
rather
too
friendly
manner
his
courage
up
to
this
moment
had
not
been
equal
to
an
invitation
well
i
said
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
not
only
saving
my
passage
money
but
also
of
earning
my
train
fare
in
england
it
will
certainly
be
cold
taking
this
deck
voyage
across
the
lake
in
the
early
hours
of
morning
and
a
glass
of
whiskey
will
keep
some
warmth
in
us
alas
the
usual
thing
happened
we
got
full
and
what
with
the
dead
effects
of
the
drink
and
a
rough
passage
across
we
arrived
in
chicago
feeling
cold
stiff
and
in
many
other
ways
uncomfortable
i
have
often
heard
salt
water
mariners
sneer
at
these
fresh
water
sailors
but
after
crossing
the
atlantic
some
eighteen
times
and
making
several
passages
across
the
lakes
my
opinion
is
that
these
vast
inland
lakes
are
more
dangerous
to
navigate
and
far
less
safe
than
the
open
seas
of
course
we
had
to
have
more
whisky
after
the
voyage
and
having
had
to
sleep
its
effect
was
almost
instantaneous
not
altogether
losing
my
senses
i
suggested
to
red
that
we
should
go
to
some
hotel
have
breakfast
and
then
go
to
bed
for
an
hour
or
two
say
till
dinner
time
which
would
refresh
us
it
was
now
eight
in
the
morning
and
red
had
unfortunately
got
into
conversation
with
a
gentleman
who
knew
something
of
australia
yes
he
said
gravely
after
listening
to
my
proposal
you
are
young
and
you
certainly
look
drunk
and
sleepy
and
had
better
follow
your
own
advice
the
hotel
is
next
door
but
one
to
this
and
you
will
find
me
here
when
you
return
not
liking
to
take
him
by
the
shoulder
and
to
gently
try
to
force
him
away
from
this
stranger
in
whose
conversation
he
evidently
seemed
to
take
a
great
delight
not
to
mention
doing
such
an
action
before
the
landlord
face
i
left
him
made
arrangements
at
the
hotel
for
two
and
then
went
to
bed
having
had
a
good
sleep
and
a
substantial
meal
and
feeling
thoroughly
refreshed
i
now
returned
to
red
whom
i
found
in
the
centre
of
half
a
dozen
loafers
besides
the
gentleman
to
whom
i
have
already
referred
on
my
appearance
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
came
to
meet
me
and
then
taking
me
on
one
side
began
in
this
way
you
have
just
come
in
the
nick
of
time
for
the
glasses
as
you
see
are
empty
pay
for
all
drinks
called
for
and
i
will
make
it
all
right
with
you
in
the
morning
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
what
have
you
done
with
over
eighty
dollars
winking
artfully
and
with
a
smile
meant
to
be
cunning
he
said
i
have
hidden
my
money
as
i
usually
do
in
these
cases
most
likely
it
is
in
the
lining
of
my
coat
but
wherever
it
is
you
may
depend
on
it
as
being
quite
safe
if
he
had
had
the
assistance
of
a
score
of
the
most
inveterate
drunkards
i
know
he
could
not
in
this
short
time
have
squandered
between
eighty
and
ninety
dollars
red
had
earned
dollars
and
a
half
and
up
to
the
time
of
my
leaving
him
had
spent
but
very
little
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
been
robbed
and
that
this
befell
him
in
all
his
sprees
after
calling
for
a
round
of
drinks
i
left
the
house
knowing
that
red
would
soon
follow
which
he
did
and
at
once
i
persuaded
him
to
bed
and
the
next
morning
saw
the
same
peculiarities
as
before
his
going
into
corners
up
side
streets
to
feel
the
lining
of
his
clothes
he
was
not
satisfied
at
seeing
no
tear
in
the
lining
of
his
cap
but
must
hold
it
in
his
hand
and
feel
every
inch
of
it
somewhere
on
my
person
he
reiterated
i
have
secreted
three
twenty
dollar
bills
i
have
a
distinct
recollection
of
doing
so
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
remember
what
part
you
have
been
robbed
i
answered
with
a
little
disgust
not
willing
to
leave
him
in
his
present
circumstances
and
only
too
sorry
that
i
had
not
done
so
when
he
was
almost
as
well
off
as
myself
i
shared
my
dollars
with
him
saying
in
an
offended
manner
the
sooner
we
squander
this
stuff
the
better
it
will
please
us
we
spent
it
in
one
week
in
chicago
and
were
again
without
a
cent
again
i
said
with
some
exaggeration
winter
is
here
and
we
are
in
the
same
position
as
at
the
end
of
last
summer
what
now
we
are
without
money
said
red
but
there
is
still
nothing
to
prevent
us
from
our
first
intention
of
visiting
england
we
will
beat
our
way
to
baltimore
without
delay
i
am
known
in
that
port
by
the
cattle
foremen
and
owners
and
we
are
almost
sure
of
a
ship
as
soon
as
we
arrive
after
all
i
thought
eager
for
a
new
experience
one
trip
will
not
come
amiss
chapter
x
the
cattleman
office
we
found
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
easy
to
beat
and
were
at
the
end
of
our
journey
in
a
very
few
days
when
we
entered
the
office
from
which
place
owners
and
foremen
were
supplied
with
men
it
was
evident
to
me
that
red
was
well
known
in
this
place
hearing
him
make
enquiries
of
washington
shorty
new
york
fatty
philadelphia
slim
and
others
at
this
place
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
oklahoma
sam
an
extremely
quiet
man
very
much
respected
in
that
he
had
a
cold
blooded
fashion
of
whittling
wood
and
paring
his
nails
with
a
steel
blade
nearly
a
foot
long
another
queer
character
was
baldy
of
whom
australian
red
related
this
anecdote
when
stranded
in
liverpool
and
hungry
he
once
took
up
a
position
in
front
of
a
confectioner
shop
and
being
an
extremely
lazy
man
placed
his
shoulder
against
the
and
settled
himself
for
a
long
reverie
he
might
have
been
there
an
hour
or
more
when
the
baker
came
out
and
complained
of
baldy
person
being
ragged
and
dirty
as
the
reason
why
people
hurried
past
his
establishment
telling
baldy
straight
that
his
presence
was
detrimental
to
the
trade
of
any
shop
that
catered
to
the
inner
man
baldy
too
lazy
to
speak
much
less
show
any
signs
of
anger
took
a
firmer
bearing
on
the
post
and
settled
to
a
more
prolonged
reverie
two
or
three
hours
elapsed
when
the
baker
who
had
come
several
times
to
stare
at
him
through
the
window
rushed
out
and
shouted
with
much
irritation
for
heaven
sake
go
here
take
this
sixpence
and
let
me
see
the
last
of
you
baldy
who
had
not
wished
the
baker
good
morning
wished
him
good
afternoon
and
strolled
quietly
away
with
the
price
of
a
good
meal
in
his
hand
nobody
who
thoroughly
understood
baldy
disposition
would
wonder
at
this
for
this
success
after
all
was
only
the
result
of
laziness
but
most
of
his
companions
gave
him
credit
for
using
unique
strategy
in
obtaining
money
shelter
only
was
supplied
at
this
office
and
that
of
the
barest
kind
being
no
other
than
the
hard
floor
and
blanketless
owing
to
this
the
men
who
after
making
a
trip
often
had
to
wait
sometimes
two
or
three
weeks
for
another
chance
were
all
good
beggars
some
of
them
had
begged
baltimore
off
and
on
for
ten
years
and
knew
every
good
house
in
the
city
one
would
say
i
shall
go
to
the
dressmaker
for
my
breakfast
another
intended
to
go
to
the
dairy
the
fat
woman
or
the
dentist
the
latter
being
always
good
for
money
in
the
shape
of
a
ten
cent
piece
we
had
been
at
this
office
three
days
when
the
shipper
sent
australian
red
and
myself
with
four
others
to
rope
cattle
at
the
yards
seven
hundred
and
fifty
head
of
cattle
had
to
be
shipped
that
night
and
the
ropes
had
to
be
placed
on
their
necks
or
horns
with
which
they
had
to
be
fastened
to
their
places
aboard
ship
after
red
had
taken
a
rope
and
given
me
a
practical
illustration
of
what
was
to
be
done
the
cattle
began
to
arrive
they
were
very
wild
having
just
come
from
the
plains
of
the
west
there
was
a
long
narrow
shoot
in
the
yards
with
one
end
blocked
and
when
a
number
of
cattle
had
been
driven
into
this
and
had
wedged
themselves
too
close
and
fast
to
be
capable
of
any
wild
movement
it
was
our
business
to
slip
a
noose
around
their
horns
or
necks
draw
this
rope
as
tight
as
possible
and
fasten
it
with
a
knot
so
as
to
prevent
it
from
slipping
when
this
was
accomplished
the
end
of
the
shoot
was
opened
and
they
were
rushed
out
with
their
ropes
dangling
and
a
fresh
batch
were
then
driven
in
and
served
likewise
after
which
they
were
put
in
cars
and
sent
to
the
ship
now
the
foreman
knowing
red
asked
him
if
he
would
like
to
go
with
him
to
which
red
answered
yes
at
the
same
time
putting
in
a
good
word
for
me
which
at
once
met
with
the
approval
we
were
not
therefore
surprised
on
our
return
when
the
shipper
called
us
into
his
private
office
to
sign
articles
red
to
receive
two
pounds
for
the
trip
and
myself
thirty
shillings
an
amount
seldom
paid
to
a
raw
hand
except
on
the
recommendation
of
owner
or
foreman
i
shall
never
forget
the
first
night
experience
when
the
cattle
were
brought
to
the
ship
in
a
train
of
cars
a
large
sloping
gangway
was
erected
to
span
the
distance
between
ship
and
shore
and
up
this
incline
the
poor
beasts
were
unmercifully
prodded
with
long
poles
sharpened
at
the
end
and
used
by
the
shore
cattlemen
the
animals
were
so
new
to
the
conditions
that
they
had
no
notion
of
what
was
expected
of
them
and
almost
overleaped
one
another
in
their
anxiety
to
get
away
what
with
the
shout
of
savage
triumph
the
curse
of
disappointment
and
the
slipping
and
falling
of
the
steers
i
was
strongly
tempted
to
escape
the
scene
as
the
cattle
were
being
driven
aboard
we
cattlemen
who
had
signed
for
their
future
charge
caught
their
ropes
which
we
were
required
to
fasten
to
a
strong
stanchion
board
sometimes
one
would
run
up
behind
and
prevent
himself
from
turning
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
crossed
the
backs
of
others
that
had
been
firmly
secured
so
as
to
force
this
animal
to
a
proper
position
the
animal
whose
back
i
was
using
for
this
purpose
began
to
heave
and
toss
and
at
last
succeeding
in
throwing
me
across
the
back
of
the
other
this
one
tossing
and
rearing
until
i
was
in
danger
of
my
life
only
the
pressure
of
the
other
beasts
preventing
him
from
crushing
my
limbs
taking
possession
of
his
rope
i
held
it
to
a
cattleman
who
was
standing
waiting
and
ready
in
the
alley
and
he
quickly
fastened
this
refractory
animal
to
the
crossboards
now
the
foreman
had
been
watching
this
and
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
i
was
a
good
man
with
cattle
said
he
would
like
me
to
be
the
night
watchman
this
undoubtedly
does
require
a
good
man
as
i
soon
discovered
on
the
first
night
out
there
were
two
lots
of
cattle
aboard
and
for
these
two
foremen
two
lots
of
cattlemen
and
two
watchmen
as
all
hands
are
available
in
the
day
any
difficulty
with
the
cattle
can
soon
be
attended
to
if
necessary
all
hands
taking
part
but
when
there
is
any
trouble
at
night
one
watchman
only
has
the
assistance
of
the
other
who
of
course
expects
the
same
aid
from
him
in
cases
of
emergency
now
if
a
number
of
cattle
have
broken
loose
and
worked
themselves
into
intricate
positions
the
watchman
is
supposed
to
awake
the
foreman
and
his
men
to
assist
him
but
one
would
rather
struggle
all
night
with
his
difficulties
than
to
take
these
men
at
their
word
knowing
their
peevishness
and
dislike
for
a
man
who
has
disturbed
them
from
a
sound
sleep
a
watchman
is
therefore
told
to
call
up
all
hands
if
he
can
not
cope
with
the
cattle
under
his
charge
but
he
is
never
expected
to
do
so
what
soon
breaks
the
spirit
of
these
wild
animals
is
the
continual
motion
of
the
vessel
there
is
always
plenty
of
trouble
at
first
when
they
slip
forward
and
backward
but
in
a
few
days
they
get
their
and
sway
their
bodies
easily
to
the
ship
motion
the
wild
terror
leaves
their
eyes
and
when
they
can
no
more
smell
their
native
land
they
cease
bellowing
and
settle
calmly
down
this
restlessness
breaks
out
afresh
when
nearing
shore
on
the
other
side
and
again
they
bellow
loud
and
often
long
before
the
mariner
on
the
has
sighted
land
we
also
had
on
this
trip
two
thousand
head
of
sheep
quartered
on
the
hurricane
deck
when
we
were
six
days
out
there
came
a
heavy
storm
and
the
starboard
side
was
made
clean
as
far
as
pens
and
sheep
were
concerned
one
wave
bearing
them
all
away
this
happened
at
night
and
on
the
following
morning
the
sheep
men
were
elated
at
having
less
work
to
do
during
the
remainder
of
the
voyage
the
cattle
being
protected
on
the
main
deck
and
between
decks
and
their
breath
filling
the
air
with
warmth
make
the
cattleman
lot
far
more
comfortable
than
that
of
the
the
condition
of
the
cattle
can
be
seen
without
difficulty
but
ten
or
fifteen
sheep
lying
or
standing
in
the
front
of
a
crowded
pen
may
be
concealing
the
dead
or
dying
that
are
lying
in
the
background
for
this
reason
it
is
every
morning
necessary
to
crawl
through
the
pens
far
back
in
quest
of
the
sick
and
the
dead
and
it
is
nothing
unusual
to
find
half
a
dozen
dead
ones
the
voyage
would
not
be
considered
bad
if
thirty
sheep
only
died
out
of
two
thousand
what
a
strange
assortment
of
men
were
these
cattlemen
and
sheepmen
one
man
called
blacky
a
bully
without
being
a
coward
fell
in
love
with
a
small
white
cat
which
we
had
found
in
the
forecastle
his
ruffianism
at
once
disappeared
and
every
time
he
was
at
liberty
instead
of
looking
for
trouble
with
his
he
could
be
seen
peacefully
nursing
this
cat
at
the
same
time
addressing
it
endearingly
as
little
white
dolly
and
such
simple
language
as
a
child
might
use
it
was
our
duty
to
keep
the
cattle
standing
and
not
to
allow
them
to
rest
too
long
on
their
knees
and
not
let
them
on
any
account
stretch
full
length
in
the
pens
one
reason
for
this
was
that
a
kneeling
steer
would
be
overstepped
by
his
nearest
neighbour
and
if
the
latter
happened
to
rise
their
ropes
which
were
so
fastened
as
to
give
them
very
little
freedom
would
be
tightened
and
crossed
bringing
their
heads
together
in
such
close
proximity
that
they
would
make
frantic
efforts
to
escape
each
other
presence
and
another
reason
for
not
allowing
them
to
lie
down
for
any
length
of
time
was
that
their
joints
would
become
so
stiff
as
to
make
them
almost
incapable
of
rising
though
goaded
by
the
most
heartless
cruelty
i
used
the
most
humane
methods
to
attain
this
end
and
sought
to
inspire
terror
in
them
by
the
use
of
the
most
ferocious
which
often
succeeded
if
that
failed
to
raise
them
i
struck
them
with
a
flat
stick
on
the
haunches
which
they
could
scarcely
feel
at
the
same
time
not
forgetting
to
use
my
voice
not
succeeding
in
this
i
resorted
to
the
old
remedy
which
rarely
fails
standing
at
their
backs
and
twisting
their
tails
a
bullock
can
kick
in
any
direction
there
is
terrible
power
in
his
side
kick
also
his
front
kick
throwing
his
hind
leg
forward
with
a
speed
that
is
remarkable
for
such
an
unwieldy
animal
but
his
back
kick
when
you
stand
back
to
back
with
him
has
not
the
least
power
to
cause
hurt
the
other
watchman
and
myself
had
about
an
equal
number
of
cattle
under
our
charge
and
when
i
was
in
difficulty
he
kindly
came
to
my
assistance
and
i
did
likewise
for
him
although
he
seldom
seemed
to
need
other
help
than
his
own
we
made
our
rounds
about
every
half
hour
sometimes
i
found
a
steer
in
the
alley
by
some
means
or
other
he
had
cleared
the
head
board
and
still
being
a
prisoner
stood
fastened
outside
the
pen
instead
of
inside
another
time
we
would
find
one
standing
with
his
tail
to
the
instead
of
his
head
owing
to
the
rope
getting
loose
or
being
broken
after
which
he
had
turned
himself
around
to
see
if
there
was
any
way
of
escape
behind
him
it
required
great
care
in
cases
of
this
kind
to
place
them
again
in
their
original
positions
up
till
the
fourth
night
we
had
experienced
no
bad
weather
and
the
cattle
had
been
quiet
and
requiring
little
care
on
this
particular
night
my
attention
had
been
drawn
several
times
to
a
big
black
steer
which
time
after
time
had
persisted
in
lying
down
at
last
in
pity
for
the
poor
beast
i
let
him
rest
thinking
to
get
him
into
a
standing
position
at
the
last
moment
when
i
went
off
duty
after
calling
the
foreman
and
his
men
but
when
that
last
moment
came
i
failed
in
all
my
efforts
to
raise
this
animal
whose
joints
i
suppose
had
become
stiff
after
a
prolonged
rest
i
was
not
therefore
greatly
surprised
when
the
foreman
came
after
i
had
gone
off
duty
to
the
forecastle
with
the
complaint
of
having
found
a
number
of
cattle
lying
down
and
one
he
said
in
particular
which
must
have
been
lying
down
half
of
the
night
when
i
left
the
cattle
i
said
nothing
seemed
to
be
wrong
come
up
and
see
this
one
he
answered
i
followed
him
on
deck
and
there
i
saw
several
cattlemen
standing
in
front
of
a
pen
in
which
i
recognised
the
big
black
steer
he
was
now
lying
full
length
in
the
pen
the
others
having
had
to
be
removed
for
his
convenience
see
this
said
the
foreman
this
creature
should
be
standing
twist
his
tail
he
continued
to
a
cattleman
who
at
once
obeyed
during
this
operation
another
cattleman
fiercely
prodded
the
poor
creature
side
with
a
pitchfork
which
must
have
gone
an
inch
into
the
body
at
the
same
time
another
beat
the
animal
about
the
head
with
a
wooden
stake
dangerously
near
the
eyes
the
animal
groaned
and
its
great
body
heaved
but
it
made
no
attempt
to
move
its
legs
wait
said
the
foreman
then
we
will
see
what
this
will
do
he
then
took
out
of
his
mouth
a
large
chew
of
tobacco
and
deliberately
placed
it
on
one
of
the
animal
eyes
my
heart
sickened
within
me
on
seeing
this
and
i
knew
that
i
would
have
to
be
less
gentle
with
these
poor
creatures
to
save
them
the
worst
of
cruelty
in
a
second
or
two
the
poor
beast
maddened
by
pain
made
frantic
efforts
to
rise
tried
again
and
again
and
after
seeing
its
great
sides
panting
and
hearing
a
number
of
pitiful
groans
it
succeeded
in
the
attempt
these
cattlemen
are
as
a
rule
great
thieves
and
well
the
sailors
and
firemen
know
it
and
especially
the
steward
and
cook
one
evening
when
the
men
had
finished
their
day
work
and
i
was
preparing
to
go
on
duty
for
the
night
i
heard
blacky
propose
a
night
raid
on
the
captain
chickens
which
were
kept
in
a
small
coop
under
the
bridge
and
rather
difficult
to
rob
considering
the
bridge
was
always
occupied
by
the
captain
or
one
of
his
first
officers
but
next
morning
on
coming
to
the
forecastle
i
was
not
greatly
surprised
to
smell
a
peculiar
and
a
not
unpleasant
odour
coming
from
that
place
blacky
and
another
had
made
their
raid
during
the
previous
night
leisurely
killing
the
chickens
on
the
spot
which
was
certainly
the
best
plan
when
i
descended
the
forecastle
steps
i
saw
that
the
stove
was
red
hot
on
which
was
a
large
tin
can
full
of
potatoes
onions
and
chicken
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
did
not
scruple
to
partake
of
this
rogue
mess
knowing
from
experience
how
this
company
ran
their
boats
allowing
their
stewards
such
miserly
small
amounts
for
provisions
that
the
common
sailors
and
firemen
did
not
get
sufficient
food
to
eat
bad
as
its
quality
was
when
we
arrived
at
liverpool
we
were
not
long
clearing
our
decks
of
cattle
after
one
is
forced
to
lead
which
is
often
difficult
to
do
they
all
follow
and
it
is
the
same
with
the
sheep
it
is
more
often
necessary
to
control
their
mad
rush
than
to
goad
them
on
we
received
payment
aboard
red
two
pounds
myself
thirty
shillings
one
other
a
pound
and
the
rest
ten
shillings
each
which
was
to
board
and
lodge
us
ashore
for
six
days
when
we
would
have
passenger
tickets
back
to
the
port
from
which
we
had
sailed
if
the
ship
from
any
cause
was
delayed
over
this
number
of
days
we
were
to
receive
an
extra
half
a
crown
for
every
day
over
red
having
been
in
liverpool
several
times
previously
led
the
way
to
a
cheap
house
at
which
place
i
persuaded
them
to
pay
down
six
nights
lodging
so
as
to
make
sure
of
some
shelter
not
forgetting
to
caution
them
against
drink
as
they
would
need
every
penny
of
the
remainder
for
food
which
would
be
more
difficult
to
obtain
in
this
country
than
their
own
these
cattlemen
are
recognised
as
the
scum
of
america
a
wild
lawless
class
of
people
on
whom
the
scum
of
europe
unscrupulously
impose
they
are
an
idle
lot
but
coming
from
a
land
of
plenty
they
never
allow
themselves
to
feel
the
pangs
of
hunger
until
they
land
on
the
shores
of
england
when
their
courage
for
begging
is
cooled
by
the
sight
of
a
greater
poverty
having
kind
hearts
they
are
soon
rendered
penniless
by
the
importunities
of
beggars
men
waylay
them
in
the
public
streets
for
tobacco
and
they
are
marked
men
in
the
public
houses
marked
by
their
own
voices
first
one
enters
and
makes
a
successful
appeal
who
quickly
informs
another
and
others
as
quickly
follow
these
wild
but
men
grown
exceedingly
proud
by
a
comparison
of
the
comfortable
homes
of
america
with
these
scenes
of
extreme
poverty
in
liverpool
and
other
large
give
and
give
of
their
few
shillings
until
they
are
themselves
reduced
to
the
utmost
want
and
so
it
was
on
this
occasion
the
next
day
after
landing
i
made
my
way
to
the
public
library
for
i
had
not
enjoyed
books
for
a
considerable
time
when
i
returned
from
this
place
australian
red
at
once
approached
me
to
borrow
money
with
his
old
hint
of
having
some
concealed
on
questioning
the
others
six
in
number
i
found
that
these
men
had
not
the
price
of
a
loaf
of
bread
among
them
as
for
myself
i
had
not
been
drinking
and
had
only
spent
seven
shillings
and
a
part
of
that
had
been
given
away
in
charity
for
even
in
the
ragged
lads
set
their
hungry
eyes
on
one
meal
and
sidle
up
with
the
plaintive
remark
that
they
will
be
thankful
for
anything
that
is
left
in
such
cases
who
could
help
but
attend
to
them
at
once
before
attempting
to
enjoy
his
own
meal
as
far
as
my
money
went
i
maintained
red
and
the
others
but
the
day
previous
to
sailing
there
was
not
one
penny
left
we
were
to
sail
the
following
night
but
would
not
be
supplied
with
food
until
breakfast
time
the
next
morning
when
that
hour
arrived
we
were
all
weak
from
hunger
not
having
had
food
for
over
forty
hours
when
the
food
did
arrive
in
the
forecastle
these
hungry
men
strove
for
it
like
wild
beasts
without
any
system
of
equal
shares
what
a
monotonous
life
we
now
had
for
thirteen
days
no
work
nothing
to
do
but
to
eat
and
sleep
and
how
i
had
intended
to
enjoy
this
part
of
the
trip
the
few
hours
i
had
spent
in
the
library
had
brought
back
my
old
passion
for
reading
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
distress
of
others
i
had
now
been
the
happy
possessor
of
some
good
books
this
was
not
to
be
for
i
was
to
lie
in
my
bunk
with
but
one
consolation
that
i
had
sufficient
tobacco
under
seal
with
the
steward
to
last
me
until
the
end
of
the
voyage
this
new
experience
was
a
disappointment
and
it
was
my
firm
resolve
on
returning
to
baltimore
to
seek
some
more
remunerative
employment
to
save
and
then
to
work
my
passage
back
to
england
in
this
same
way
and
go
home
with
my
earnings
we
had
a
rough
passage
back
the
ship
being
light
with
little
more
than
ballast
one
night
the
vessel
made
a
fearful
roll
and
the
lights
went
dark
and
we
thought
every
moment
that
she
would
turn
over
a
coal
bunker
was
smashed
by
the
waves
and
large
pieces
of
coal
bounded
across
the
deck
with
a
force
that
would
have
broken
every
bone
in
a
man
body
pieces
of
heavy
wood
that
would
have
cut
off
a
man
feet
as
clean
as
a
knife
slid
across
the
deck
from
side
to
side
we
thought
the
end
had
come
especially
when
we
saw
an
old
sailor
rush
on
deck
in
his
bare
feet
his
shirt
being
his
only
apparel
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
for
some
hours
for
we
were
forced
to
cling
to
our
bunks
with
all
our
strength
to
save
ourselves
from
being
thrown
out
when
we
would
be
rolled
here
and
there
and
soon
battered
into
an
unconscious
state
we
reached
baltimore
on
the
thirteenth
day
and
at
once
made
our
way
to
the
cattlemen
office
intending
on
the
morrow
to
make
better
arrangements
for
the
future
chapter
xi
a
strange
cattleman
it
was
now
the
beginning
of
october
and
the
mornings
and
the
evenings
were
getting
colder
although
baltimore
is
a
southern
town
and
was
therefore
free
from
the
severe
cold
of
towns
further
north
it
was
not
so
far
south
as
to
make
plenty
of
clothes
dispensable
we
two
australian
red
and
myself
tramped
this
city
day
after
day
for
work
but
without
success
there
were
only
two
courses
left
open
to
us
to
make
three
or
four
more
trips
on
cattle
boats
until
the
coming
of
spring
when
there
would
probably
be
work
in
abundance
or
to
go
oyster
dredging
down
the
chesapeake
bay
a
winter
employment
that
was
open
to
any
man
in
baltimore
experience
not
being
necessary
red
soon
placed
the
latter
beyond
consideration
by
relating
his
own
hard
experience
of
the
same
first
of
all
the
work
was
very
hard
and
of
a
most
dangerous
kind
the
food
was
of
the
worst
and
worse
than
all
the
pay
was
of
the
smallest
a
man
would
often
cut
his
hands
with
the
shells
which
would
poison
and
swell
and
render
him
helpless
for
some
time
to
come
again
said
red
a
man
is
not
sure
of
his
money
small
as
it
is
a
few
years
ago
he
continued
it
was
a
common
occurrence
for
a
boat
to
return
and
have
to
report
the
loss
of
a
man
these
dredgers
were
never
lost
on
the
outward
trip
but
when
homeward
bound
and
the
most
hazardous
part
of
their
work
was
done
the
captain
on
coming
to
shore
would
report
a
man
lost
drowned
and
his
body
unrecovered
this
drowned
man
being
an
unknown
no
relative
came
forward
to
claim
wages
from
the
captain
how
the
man
met
his
death
was
no
secret
among
the
dredgers
and
they
had
to
keep
a
wary
eye
on
their
own
lives
for
a
captain
would
often
move
the
tiller
so
suddenly
as
to
knock
a
man
overboard
accidentally
of
course
a
board
of
enquiry
looked
into
these
things
and
a
captain
was
tried
for
murder
and
escaped
with
a
sentence
of
seven
years
imprisonment
there
were
not
so
many
accidents
after
this
but
they
have
not
altogether
ceased
after
hearing
this
account
i
was
not
very
eager
for
more
practical
knowledge
of
this
profession
called
dredging
so
i
agreed
with
red
to
make
three
or
four
more
trips
as
cattlemen
until
the
spring
of
the
year
made
other
work
easy
to
be
obtained
we
returned
to
the
office
where
between
thirty
and
forty
men
were
waiting
an
opportunity
to
ship
as
i
have
said
before
some
of
these
men
were
notorious
beggars
and
the
people
of
baltimore
never
seemed
to
tire
of
giving
them
charity
one
man
called
wee
scotty
who
had
been
a
cattleman
for
a
number
of
years
begged
the
town
so
much
in
some
of
the
rather
long
intervals
when
he
was
waiting
a
ship
that
he
could
take
a
stranger
with
him
three
times
a
day
for
a
month
to
be
fed
by
the
different
good
people
that
were
known
to
him
he
could
take
up
a
position
on
a
street
corner
and
say
go
to
that
house
for
breakfast
come
back
to
this
house
for
dinner
and
yonder
house
with
the
red
gate
will
provide
you
a
good
supper
in
this
way
he
kept
me
going
for
two
weeks
when
at
last
i
was
asked
to
sign
articles
to
go
with
cattle
to
glasgow
some
days
before
this
a
man
came
to
the
office
whose
peculiar
behaviour
often
drew
my
attention
to
him
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
work
his
passage
to
england
and
the
skipper
promised
him
the
first
opportunity
and
a
sum
of
ten
shillings
on
landing
there
this
was
the
reason
why
some
of
us
had
to
wait
so
long
because
having
made
trips
before
more
or
less
we
required
payment
for
our
experience
the
man
referred
to
above
had
a
white
clean
complexion
and
his
face
seemed
never
to
have
had
use
for
a
razor
although
small
of
body
and
not
seeming
capable
of
much
manual
labour
his
vitality
of
spirits
seemed
overflowing
every
minute
of
the
day
he
swaggered
more
than
any
man
present
and
was
continually
smoking
cigarettes
which
he
deftly
rolled
with
his
own
delicate
fingers
in
the
intervals
between
smoking
he
chewed
squirting
the
juice
in
defiance
of
all
laws
of
cleanliness
it
was
not
unusual
for
him
to
sing
a
song
and
his
voice
was
of
surprising
sweetness
not
of
great
power
but
the
softest
voice
i
have
ever
heard
from
a
man
although
his
aim
seemed
to
make
it
appear
rough
and
loud
as
though
ashamed
of
its
sweetness
it
often
occurred
to
me
that
this
man
was
playing
a
part
and
that
all
this
cigarette
smoking
chewing
tobacco
and
swaggering
was
a
mere
sham
an
affectation
for
a
purpose
i
could
not
after
much
watching
comprehend
he
was
free
of
speech
was
always
ridiculing
others
and
swore
like
a
trooper
yet
no
man
seemed
inclined
to
take
advantage
of
him
blackey
took
him
under
his
protection
laughing
and
inciting
him
to
mischief
he
was
certainly
not
backward
in
insulting
and
threatening
blackey
which
made
the
latter
laugh
until
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
the
men
were
spellbound
at
his
volubility
he
shook
that
red
rag
of
his
and
a
continuous
flow
of
speech
ensued
and
the
surrounding
creatures
were
mute
but
not
at
all
infuriated
his
audacity
may
have
slightly
irritated
one
or
two
but
no
man
had
the
least
idea
of
inflicting
on
him
corporal
punishment
i
and
red
were
called
to
the
office
to
sign
articles
for
glasgow
and
when
doing
so
blackey
and
this
strange
new
companion
of
his
were
signing
for
england
the
two
ships
leaving
for
their
destination
on
the
same
tide
we
were
sorry
to
lose
this
man
company
knowing
that
his
tongue
would
have
gone
far
to
amuse
our
leisure
hours
aboard
we
had
a
very
pleasant
voyage
and
this
line
of
boats
gave
us
very
little
cause
to
complain
either
of
sleeping
accommodation
or
diet
the
officers
and
ship
crew
also
being
sociable
in
their
dealings
with
us
the
same
thing
happened
at
the
end
of
this
voyage
and
we
would
have
suffered
the
same
privation
had
it
not
been
for
an
accident
on
the
fourth
morning
ashore
there
was
not
a
penny
among
us
and
the
boat
would
not
sail
for
another
two
days
australian
red
was
rummaging
his
pockets
and
piling
before
him
a
large
assortment
of
miscellaneous
articles
i
would
care
much
said
he
if
i
had
the
paltry
price
i
paid
for
this
at
the
same
time
throwing
on
the
table
a
thick
heavy
white
chain
picking
this
up
for
an
indifferent
examination
i
became
interested
and
enquired
as
to
how
it
came
into
his
possession
it
seemed
that
a
poor
fellow
had
offered
to
sell
red
the
chain
for
a
penny
red
seeing
the
man
condition
of
extreme
want
had
given
him
sixpence
at
the
same
time
refusing
to
accept
the
chain
the
poor
fellow
had
then
persisted
that
red
should
accept
it
as
a
gift
red
being
now
filled
with
his
own
troubles
wished
that
he
could
dispose
of
the
chain
to
the
same
advantage
the
chain
was
without
doubt
silver
being
stamped
on
every
link
what
cried
red
suddenly
roused
while
the
cattlemen
in
their
deep
interest
moved
forward
making
a
circle
several
feet
smaller
what
he
cried
silver
did
you
say
let
me
see
it
he
snatched
the
chain
and
without
looking
at
it
or
putting
it
in
his
pocket
rushed
out
of
the
room
without
another
word
in
five
minutes
he
returned
and
throwing
towards
me
eight
shillings
the
value
of
the
chain
in
pawn
said
none
of
this
for
drink
keep
a
tight
hand
on
it
for
our
food
supply
until
the
boat
sails
he
knew
his
own
weakness
on
first
coming
to
shore
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
buy
several
books
to
make
sure
of
them
indifferent
whether
we
suffered
hunger
or
no
for
this
reason
i
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
voyage
back
and
we
arrived
safely
at
baltimore
having
been
away
a
little
over
five
weeks
the
first
man
we
met
on
entering
the
cattlemen
office
was
blackey
who
having
made
a
shorter
trip
had
returned
some
days
previous
what
became
of
your
strange
friend
blackey
i
asked
did
he
remain
in
england
or
return
to
america
why
have
you
heard
about
it
all
asked
blackey
the
english
papers
were
full
of
the
case
we
have
heard
nothing
i
said
thinking
the
poor
fellow
had
either
been
kicked
to
death
by
one
of
the
wild
steers
or
that
he
had
either
leaped
at
the
waves
in
a
mad
fit
of
suicide
or
that
the
waves
had
leaped
at
him
and
taken
him
off
he
worked
side
by
side
with
me
for
eleven
days
said
blackey
and
by
his
singing
laughing
and
talking
he
made
a
play
of
labour
down
in
the
forecastle
at
night
he
sang
songs
and
in
spite
of
our
limited
space
and
the
rolling
of
the
ship
he
gave
many
a
dance
and
ended
by
falling
into
his
low
bunk
exhausted
and
laughing
still
in
all
my
experience
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
was
not
eager
to
sight
land
and
fill
myself
with
english
ale
on
the
eleventh
day
out
we
were
hoisting
bales
of
hay
for
the
cattle
and
he
was
assisting
me
in
the
hold
of
the
vessel
i
know
not
whether
we
failed
to
fasten
properly
the
bales
or
whether
the
cattlemen
on
deck
blundered
when
receiving
them
but
all
at
once
i
heard
a
shout
of
out
below
and
down
came
a
heavy
bale
striking
my
companion
on
the
shoulder
he
spun
around
once
or
twice
and
then
fell
unconscious
into
my
arms
the
ship
doctor
was
at
once
called
and
the
poor
fellow
was
taken
aft
several
times
a
day
i
made
enquiries
about
him
and
heard
that
he
was
out
of
danger
but
needed
rest
i
never
saw
him
again
when
we
landed
in
england
he
was
not
to
be
seen
and
i
thought
perhaps
that
he
was
too
ill
to
be
removed
without
the
assistance
of
a
vehicle
next
day
i
happened
to
pick
up
a
paper
in
which
was
a
full
and
lengthy
account
of
how
a
woman
had
worked
her
way
as
a
cattleman
from
the
port
of
baltimore
making
mention
of
the
ship
name
my
companion
was
that
woman
and
i
never
had
the
least
suspicion
continued
blackey
although
i
will
say
that
i
always
thought
him
a
queer
man
i
had
scarcely
been
in
the
office
a
week
when
i
was
offered
a
boat
for
london
only
one
man
was
required
all
the
others
with
the
exception
of
one
who
was
to
receive
fifteen
shillings
were
men
red
had
no
chance
on
this
boat
and
i
was
not
sorry
knowing
how
his
extravagant
habits
would
spoil
the
trip
enjoyment
this
was
a
voyage
of
some
delight
both
aboard
and
ashore
having
been
in
london
before
i
knew
what
enjoyment
could
be
had
with
but
little
expense
of
museums
parks
gardens
picture
galleries
etc
i
made
friends
with
a
decent
fellow
who
had
been
a
schoolmaster
and
persuading
him
out
of
deptford
we
procured
lodgings
in
southwark
and
from
that
place
we
paid
our
visits
to
the
different
scenes
we
saw
none
of
the
other
cattlemen
until
the
hour
of
sailing
many
of
the
poor
fellows
had
lost
their
money
on
the
first
night
ashore
and
now
had
strange
experiences
to
relate
of
workhouses
shelters
and
unsuccessful
begging
when
we
arrived
at
baltimore
it
wanted
one
week
to
christmas
day
and
there
was
not
much
chance
to
ship
again
for
two
or
three
weeks
owing
to
the
number
of
men
waiting
as
i
have
said
before
the
people
of
baltimore
are
extremely
and
no
man
need
starve
if
he
has
the
courage
to
express
his
wants
the
women
seem
to
be
as
beautiful
as
they
are
good
for
i
have
never
seen
finer
women
than
those
of
baltimore
and
a
man
would
not
be
making
the
worst
of
life
if
he
idled
all
day
in
a
principal
street
reading
the
face
of
beauty
and
studying
the
grace
of
forms
that
pass
him
by
but
it
is
of
their
kindness
and
generosity
that
i
would
now
speak
for
christmas
eve
had
come
and
australian
red
accompanied
by
blackey
had
taken
me
on
one
side
the
former
beginning
in
this
way
will
you
join
this
night
expedition
what
we
want
you
to
do
is
to
carry
a
small
bag
no
more
and
all
the
begging
will
be
done
by
us
i
had
visions
of
the
police
stopping
me
and
enquiring
the
contents
of
such
a
strange
burden
but
being
an
unsuccessful
beggar
and
feeling
too
independent
to
have
others
perform
this
office
for
me
without
making
some
little
effort
to
deserve
their
maintenance
i
agreed
to
their
proposal
and
that
evening
at
six
we
sallied
forth
together
they
both
started
on
a
long
street
red
taking
one
side
and
blackey
the
other
whilst
i
waited
the
result
some
yards
in
advance
a
safe
distance
away
they
could
scarcely
have
been
refused
in
one
house
for
in
less
than
ten
minutes
they
were
both
at
my
side
dropping
paper
parcels
into
the
empty
bag
the
mouth
of
which
i
held
open
all
at
once
blackey
disappeared
having
been
called
in
to
supper
the
same
thing
happened
to
red
two
or
three
minutes
after
when
they
approached
me
again
with
other
parcels
they
both
agreed
to
accept
no
more
invitations
to
supper
but
that
they
would
excuse
themselves
as
having
families
at
home
they
continued
this
for
half
an
hour
hardly
more
when
the
bag
was
full
to
the
mouth
now
said
blackey
take
this
to
the
office
and
we
will
remain
to
fill
our
pockets
after
which
we
will
follow
as
soon
as
possible
or
do
you
prefer
to
wait
for
us
i
preferred
to
go
and
avoiding
the
main
streets
and
lighted
places
succeeded
in
getting
back
without
rousing
the
curiosity
of
the
police
they
soon
followed
with
another
supply
stored
in
their
capacious
pockets
what
delighted
them
most
but
of
which
i
took
very
little
account
knowing
to
what
use
it
would
be
put
was
that
they
had
received
several
small
amounts
in
money
the
total
being
one
dollar
and
cents
i
shall
never
forget
this
begging
expedition
when
the
different
parcels
were
unrolled
we
beheld
everything
that
the
most
fastidious
taste
could
desire
for
not
one
parcel
i
believe
consisted
of
simple
bread
and
butter
much
less
the
former
by
its
own
common
self
there
were
fried
oysters
turkey
chicken
beef
mutton
ham
and
sausages
irish
potatoes
sweet
potatoes
and
yams
brown
bread
white
bread
pancakes
tarts
pie
and
cake
of
every
description
bananas
apples
grapes
and
oranges
winding
up
with
a
quantity
of
mixed
nuts
and
a
bag
of
sweets
such
were
the
contents
of
over
sixty
parcels
got
with
such
ease
blackey
had
been
refused
at
three
doors
and
red
had
failed
at
five
but
had
been
requested
to
call
back
at
two
of
them
and
had
not
troubled
to
do
so
not
having
properly
located
the
houses
chapter
xii
thieves
cockney
more
was
a
cattleman
hailing
from
the
port
of
baltimore
he
was
a
born
thief
and
strange
to
say
nearly
blind
but
without
doubt
he
was
a
feeler
of
the
first
magnitude
if
he
borrowed
a
needle
and
the
said
article
was
honestly
returned
it
behoved
the
lender
knowing
the
borrower
thievish
propensities
to
carefully
examine
it
to
see
that
the
eye
had
not
been
abstracted
for
as
donovan
remarked
cockney
more
could
steal
the
milk
out
of
one
tea
when
i
have
looked
at
cockney
long
thin
fingers
i
have
often
wondered
whether
he
had
power
to
disjoint
them
at
will
letting
them
down
the
legs
of
his
trousers
to
rummage
the
locality
while
he
stood
innocently
talking
to
us
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
that
honour
which
is
supposed
to
exist
among
thieves
was
not
known
to
cockney
more
for
he
would
rob
his
best
friend
and
do
it
in
such
a
way
that
no
man
could
take
umbrage
for
instance
six
of
us
had
landed
in
liverpool
having
been
paid
off
that
morning
cockney
knowing
the
ins
and
outs
of
that
city
and
its
numerous
pitfalls
for
strangers
escorted
us
at
once
to
a
cheap
where
we
paid
in
advance
for
a
week
bed
thus
being
assured
of
shelter
until
the
ship
was
ready
to
return
the
next
morning
we
sat
six
disconsolate
men
in
the
kitchen
not
one
of
us
having
the
price
of
his
breakfast
cockney
being
the
last
to
rise
entered
at
last
and
noting
our
despondent
looks
enquired
as
to
the
cause
on
being
told
he
went
out
and
returned
in
a
few
moments
with
tea
sugar
bread
and
sausages
in
fact
he
continued
these
kind
deeds
during
our
week
ashore
the
others
being
mostly
strangers
blessed
him
for
a
good
fellow
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
was
simply
returning
us
our
own
for
he
spent
three
times
more
money
during
those
few
days
than
he
had
received
for
the
trip
i
remembered
a
mean
little
trick
that
he
had
performed
on
one
of
the
cattlemen
that
very
first
morning
ashore
true
we
were
all
getting
drunk
fast
but
i
never
thought
cockney
would
be
daring
enough
to
attempt
such
a
deed
in
our
first
stage
of
intoxication
he
had
asked
this
cattleman
for
a
chew
of
tobacco
and
the
man
had
generously
offered
him
the
whole
plug
to
help
himself
cockney
took
this
plug
and
biting
off
a
piece
returned
the
bitten
part
to
the
owner
and
himself
pocketed
the
plug
i
was
speechless
with
astonishment
at
seeing
this
and
more
so
when
the
strange
cattleman
innocently
received
the
bitten
part
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
without
having
perceived
anything
wrong
cockney
and
myself
were
on
the
best
of
terms
and
yet
some
time
previous
to
the
above
episode
he
had
served
me
a
trick
which
ought
to
have
severed
our
friendship
for
ever
i
was
at
the
shipping
office
and
had
that
morning
signed
for
a
trip
to
london
have
you
sufficient
tobacco
and
a
spoon
knife
fork
and
plate
enquired
cockney
yes
i
replied
and
i
have
also
a
new
pack
of
cards
so
that
we
may
enjoy
our
leisure
hours
aboard
cockney
was
pleased
to
hear
this
although
he
was
not
to
accompany
me
on
this
trip
let
me
see
them
said
he
this
i
did
and
being
as
i
have
said
nearly
blind
he
took
them
to
the
window
for
examination
but
returned
them
almost
immediately
then
came
a
shout
for
all
men
who
had
signed
for
the
london
trip
and
hastily
wishing
cockney
and
others
i
left
the
office
on
the
second
day
out
we
were
all
at
leisure
for
an
hour
or
more
and
enquiries
went
around
as
to
who
had
a
pack
of
cards
my
cards
were
at
once
produced
and
taking
partners
we
were
about
to
settle
to
a
little
enjoyment
alas
when
my
cards
were
taken
out
of
the
new
case
they
were
found
to
be
a
dirty
greasy
old
pack
with
several
missing
and
of
course
card
playing
was
out
of
the
question
i
at
once
knew
what
had
happened
cockney
had
substituted
these
old
ones
for
the
new
what
time
he
pretended
to
be
interested
at
the
window
that
little
trick
meant
twelve
days
misery
for
eight
men
for
we
could
not
get
another
pack
until
we
landed
in
london
on
that
trip
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
cockney
company
we
had
with
us
donovan
who
as
a
thief
certainly
ran
cockney
a
good
second
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
all
cattlemen
are
thieves
and
the
one
who
complains
of
going
ashore
without
his
razor
often
has
in
his
possession
another
knife
comb
or
soap
on
the
second
day
out
i
missed
my
and
without
loss
of
time
boldly
accused
cockney
more
to
his
face
telling
him
that
however
much
i
admired
his
dexterity
in
other
people
pockets
i
had
not
the
least
suspicion
that
he
would
be
guilty
of
such
a
trick
on
an
old
pal
no
more
have
i
said
he
what
kind
of
knife
was
it
on
being
told
he
advised
me
to
say
no
more
about
it
and
that
he
would
endeavour
to
find
it
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
the
next
day
donovan
was
shouting
indignantly
who
has
been
to
my
bunk
and
stolen
a
knife
after
this
i
lost
my
soap
but
did
not
think
it
worth
while
mentioning
such
a
petty
loss
on
approaching
cockney
more
for
the
loan
of
his
he
giving
me
strict
injunctions
to
return
it
at
once
and
not
leave
it
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
thieves
lent
me
my
own
soap
this
trip
was
a
memorable
one
and
no
doubt
cockney
made
the
best
haul
of
his
life
we
were
together
in
liverpool
cockney
donovan
and
myself
and
as
usual
drinking
a
stranger
hearing
by
our
conversation
that
we
hailed
from
america
invited
us
to
drink
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
expressed
a
regret
that
he
was
out
of
work
and
had
no
means
of
visiting
america
nothing
is
easier
said
cockney
if
you
place
yourself
unreservedly
in
our
hands
we
are
to
sail
on
thursday
and
i
can
stow
you
away
as
i
have
successfully
done
with
others
many
thanks
replied
the
other
and
so
it
was
agreed
on
the
following
thursday
we
went
aboard
the
cockney
carrying
a
large
bag
which
contained
the
stowaway
clothes
etc
when
the
officers
entered
our
forecastle
the
stowaway
was
of
course
not
present
but
when
they
were
searching
other
places
the
stowaway
was
then
sitting
comfortably
among
us
these
things
being
well
managed
by
cockney
more
after
this
search
they
would
pay
us
no
more
visits
and
the
stowaway
was
safe
and
could
go
on
deck
at
night
for
fresh
air
the
only
danger
now
was
to
land
him
in
america
this
the
cockney
affirmed
was
a
danger
of
little
account
now
as
i
have
said
this
stowaway
had
a
bag
and
cockney
more
and
donovan
were
great
thieves
therefore
it
was
not
at
all
surprising
to
hear
that
the
poor
fellow
was
soon
without
a
second
shirt
to
his
back
he
had
lent
me
a
book
the
value
of
which
i
did
not
think
him
capable
of
appreciating
and
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
it
should
not
be
returned
until
asked
for
but
when
i
heard
him
complain
of
losing
so
many
things
through
pity
i
became
honest
and
returned
it
but
where
was
his
watch
and
chain
his
brushes
and
where
were
his
clothes
his
tools
razor
strop
and
many
other
useful
articles
all
these
things
were
in
possession
of
donovan
and
cockney
knew
it
and
appeared
to
be
grieving
over
lost
chances
for
he
was
supposed
to
have
that
honour
which
is
among
thieves
and
as
donovan
had
been
too
fast
for
him
he
had
no
other
option
than
to
sit
quiet
under
the
circumstances
on
the
day
before
our
arrival
at
baltimore
i
happened
to
enter
the
forecastle
and
found
donovan
his
face
pale
feverously
rummaging
cockney
more
bunk
what
do
you
think
said
he
that
blasted
cockney
has
robbed
me
of
everything
and
so
he
had
he
had
allowed
donovan
to
do
all
the
dirty
work
of
abstracting
the
goods
one
by
one
as
the
chance
occurred
he
had
allowed
him
the
pleasure
of
their
care
and
possession
for
many
days
and
then
he
had
robbed
him
but
the
artful
part
of
the
business
was
this
he
had
not
left
donovan
any
chance
to
recover
the
goods
for
he
had
made
friends
with
one
of
the
sailors
the
latter
having
a
forecastle
to
themselves
and
had
prevailed
on
that
person
to
take
charge
of
a
parcel
for
him
until
all
the
cattlemen
landed
for
said
he
these
cattlemen
are
born
thieves
yes
he
had
done
the
business
neatly
for
the
desperate
and
much
aggrieved
donovan
who
intended
on
landing
to
recover
the
goods
by
force
saw
cockney
more
walk
ashore
as
as
himself
and
he
was
almost
shaken
in
his
belief
that
the
said
cockney
was
after
all
the
thief
triumphant
chapter
xiii
the
canal
i
now
left
baltimore
travelling
alone
making
my
way
as
fast
as
possible
towards
chicago
where
a
canal
was
being
built
to
facilitate
commerce
between
that
large
inland
city
and
deep
water
at
which
place
i
soon
arrived
on
the
banks
of
that
canal
were
assembled
the
of
america
and
the
scum
of
europe
men
who
wanted
no
steady
employment
but
to
make
easy
and
quick
stakes
for
the
pay
was
good
so
as
to
indulge
in
periodical
sprees
or
in
rare
instances
for
the
more
laudable
purpose
of
placing
themselves
in
a
better
position
to
apply
for
more
respectable
employment
they
came
and
went
in
gangs
for
the
work
was
so
hard
that
there
were
few
men
that
did
not
require
a
week
rest
after
a
month
labour
so
much
for
the
rough
but
honest
working
element
but
unfortunately
these
canal
banks
were
infested
by
other
gangs
who
did
not
seek
work
and
yet
were
often
to
be
seen
loafing
about
the
various
camps
then
how
did
these
men
live
for
they
could
not
successfully
beg
seeing
that
work
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
perhaps
the
explanation
is
that
seldom
a
day
passed
but
what
a
dead
body
was
dragged
out
of
the
water
and
more
than
of
these
bodies
bore
the
marks
of
murder
the
bodies
were
not
those
of
men
coming
from
the
city
in
search
of
employment
but
of
such
men
as
had
been
known
to
have
quit
work
a
few
days
previous
having
then
had
a
month
or
more
pay
on
their
persons
and
who
had
been
on
the
way
to
the
city
for
enjoyment
yes
these
loafers
were
undoubtedly
the
thugs
and
murderers
and
if
a
man
was
inclined
to
hazard
his
life
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
make
it
known
that
he
on
the
following
day
was
to
draw
his
earnings
with
the
intention
of
walking
the
canal
banks
to
one
of
the
distant
towns
it
was
hardly
likely
that
he
would
reach
his
destination
but
would
be
taken
out
of
the
canal
some
days
later
a
murdered
man
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
these
unscrupulous
the
more
timid
workmen
waited
for
one
another
until
they
were
sufficiently
strong
in
number
to
discharge
themselves
and
travel
without
fear
but
alas
there
was
many
a
man
who
prided
himself
on
his
own
heart
and
muscles
for
protection
and
dared
the
journey
alone
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
there
had
been
no
houses
built
on
those
banks
therefore
no
women
walked
to
and
fro
and
no
children
played
there
no
doubt
such
are
to
be
seen
there
at
the
present
day
innocent
of
the
violence
and
the
blood
that
was
shed
there
in
the
past
i
had
applied
for
work
at
one
of
these
camps
and
being
sickened
of
the
same
in
a
little
more
than
three
weeks
demanded
my
earnings
at
the
same
time
cockney
tom
and
pat
sheeny
drew
theirs
with
the
intention
of
accompanying
them
to
chicago
being
somewhat
delayed
in
business
owing
to
the
absence
of
the
timekeeper
and
being
then
compelled
to
remain
for
dinner
we
soon
saw
the
impossibility
of
reaching
the
city
before
midnight
therefore
it
was
arranged
between
us
that
we
should
settle
for
the
night
at
some
place
half
way
between
the
camp
and
the
city
and
rise
early
so
as
to
enter
the
latter
before
noon
on
the
following
day
with
this
intention
we
started
after
receiving
dinner
and
pay
and
after
several
hours
walk
settled
down
there
would
be
six
hours
darkness
and
it
was
proposed
that
i
should
keep
awake
for
the
first
two
hours
watch
after
which
cockney
tom
would
relieve
me
and
pat
would
then
keep
watch
until
daybreak
now
in
my
two
hours
watch
i
had
on
several
occasions
heard
a
stir
in
the
adjoining
bush
but
not
being
able
to
see
whether
it
was
a
man
or
a
beast
i
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
alarm
my
companions
at
last
i
considered
my
duty
to
be
at
an
end
and
after
rousing
cockney
tom
settled
myself
for
sleep
before
i
closed
my
eyes
i
noticed
that
the
second
watch
was
still
lying
recumbent
although
he
seemed
to
be
wide
awake
but
i
was
too
intent
on
my
own
sleep
to
care
whether
he
would
be
faithful
to
his
trust
or
not
i
do
think
i
could
have
been
asleep
more
than
fifteen
minutes
when
i
was
startled
by
a
loud
shout
and
springing
to
my
feet
was
just
in
time
to
see
cockney
tom
in
pursuit
of
one
who
was
then
entering
the
bush
the
irishman
was
also
up
and
we
both
followed
the
chase
we
soon
reached
our
companion
finding
him
standing
dazed
and
confused
as
to
which
way
the
quarry
had
gone
he
explained
to
us
that
when
on
watch
he
was
lying
down
with
his
eyes
closed
but
with
his
ears
wide
open
and
all
his
mental
faculties
at
work
suddenly
he
heard
a
step
near
and
opening
his
eyes
saw
a
stranger
standing
within
three
feet
of
him
it
was
at
that
moment
that
he
gave
the
alarm
but
the
stranger
was
too
fleet
to
be
overtaken
no
doubt
said
cockney
there
is
a
gang
of
them
at
no
short
distance
from
here
and
if
we
are
wise
we
will
continue
our
journey
at
once
i
have
seen
the
man
face
before
at
the
camp
and
know
i
shall
recognise
him
if
we
meet
again
his
advice
of
continuing
our
journey
was
hardly
necessary
for
sleep
was
now
out
of
the
question
in
less
than
a
week
after
the
above
incident
we
three
having
squandered
our
earnings
in
chicago
were
back
at
the
old
camp
seeking
there
happened
to
be
only
one
vacancy
which
the
irishman
persuaded
cockney
to
accept
whilst
we
two
would
travel
on
to
the
next
camp
a
distance
of
two
miles
we
were
about
to
do
this
when
the
boss
ganger
asked
me
if
i
would
like
a
position
in
the
boarding
shanty
as
assistant
cook
knowing
that
an
assistant
cook
meant
no
more
than
carrying
water
peeling
potatoes
washing
dishes
keeping
a
good
fire
and
opening
cans
of
condensed
meat
and
preserves
i
felt
quite
confident
in
undertaking
such
a
position
so
the
cockney
and
i
started
to
work
at
once
but
before
doing
so
arranged
for
the
keep
of
pat
until
a
vacancy
occurred
his
meals
to
be
entered
to
our
account
the
next
morning
his
chance
came
and
he
was
set
to
work
we
had
been
working
four
days
and
on
the
evening
of
that
fourth
day
we
three
and
a
number
of
others
were
resting
ourselves
in
a
quiet
place
near
the
camp
whilst
seated
there
smoking
and
talking
there
came
along
four
strangers
who
seated
themselves
some
distance
from
us
but
within
earshot
of
our
conversation
no
one
paid
much
heed
to
them
for
it
was
not
unusual
to
be
visited
by
strangers
in
quest
of
work
but
there
was
one
man
who
could
not
keep
his
eyes
from
them
and
that
was
cockney
tom
yes
he
said
to
me
after
several
long
puffs
at
his
pipe
that
stranger
showing
us
his
side
face
is
the
very
man
who
attempted
to
rob
us
saying
this
the
cockney
took
off
his
cap
and
laying
it
carefully
on
the
ground
with
its
inside
uppermost
placed
therein
his
dirty
clay
pipe
as
gently
as
a
woman
putting
a
sleeping
babe
in
its
cradle
and
to
the
no
small
surprise
of
his
companions
began
to
address
them
in
this
oratorical
fashion
gentlemen
some
time
ago
a
man
attempted
to
rob
me
and
two
others
and
ever
since
then
i
have
been
longing
to
meet
him
face
to
face
at
last
we
meet
and
i
would
like
to
know
what
is
to
be
done
with
him
why
give
him
a
good
hiding
of
course
cried
several
angry
voices
on
hearing
this
the
cockney
at
once
turned
towards
the
strangers
whom
he
had
hitherto
pretended
not
to
notice
and
in
three
bounds
was
standing
over
them
placing
his
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
one
he
said
in
a
calm
voice
this
is
my
man
the
man
referred
to
rose
deliberately
to
his
feet
as
though
he
had
expected
this
and
his
companions
did
likewise
well
said
he
what
is
the
trouble
you
know
quite
well
replied
the
cockney
so
you
may
as
well
strip
without
further
question
whatever
the
stranger
was
he
certainly
was
no
coward
for
his
coat
and
waistcoat
were
soon
in
the
hands
of
his
companion
the
cockney
lost
no
time
and
the
next
minute
they
stood
squaring
before
each
other
in
such
a
scientific
way
as
promised
the
onlookers
a
most
interesting
exhibition
although
the
stranger
was
the
taller
of
the
two
the
cockney
seemed
to
possess
the
longer
reach
round
after
round
they
fought
and
in
spite
of
their
heavy
and
muddy
boots
the
footwork
was
neat
and
the
dodging
of
their
heads
and
the
feinting
of
their
arms
made
the
more
gentle
onlookers
overlook
the
drawing
of
blood
there
was
no
wrestling
or
mauling
on
the
ground
and
there
was
no
attempt
at
foul
blows
for
each
of
the
principals
seemed
to
value
the
favour
of
that
most
appreciative
assembly
it
looked
more
like
a
friendly
exhibition
than
two
men
attempting
to
take
life
the
spectators
laughed
approval
and
buzzed
with
admiration
until
even
the
bleeding
men
hearing
this
chaffed
one
another
and
smiled
at
each
other
grimly
with
their
battered
faces
yes
it
seemed
friendly
enough
until
the
tenth
round
when
the
cockney
who
the
round
previous
seemed
to
show
signs
of
weariness
called
to
his
assistance
some
latent
force
which
set
his
arms
to
work
like
a
pair
of
axes
on
a
tree
and
down
his
opponent
fell
and
the
battle
was
lost
and
won
the
stranger
was
borne
away
by
his
companions
and
cockney
tom
returned
to
the
camp
to
dress
his
injuries
which
did
not
prevent
him
from
work
on
the
following
day
the
cockney
was
well
pleased
with
this
exploit
and
if
his
opponent
was
one
of
those
thugs
and
murderers
who
had
taken
an
active
part
in
perhaps
fifty
or
sixty
murders
he
would
certainly
be
lucky
if
he
never
met
with
severer
punishment
chapter
xiv
the
i
worked
long
enough
on
this
canal
to
save
fifty
dollars
and
then
quit
feeling
the
old
restlessness
return
which
had
unsettled
me
for
some
time
with
this
comfortable
sum
in
my
possession
i
kept
beating
my
way
west
until
i
arrived
at
louis
a
large
city
on
the
mississippi
having
up
till
now
lived
frugally
and
spent
nothing
on
travelling
this
kind
of
life
was
often
irksome
to
me
when
i
have
camped
all
night
alone
in
the
woods
beside
a
fire
when
one
good
sociable
companion
might
have
turned
the
life
into
an
ideal
one
often
have
i
waked
in
the
night
or
early
morning
to
find
spaces
opposite
occupied
by
one
or
two
strangers
who
had
seen
the
fire
in
the
distance
and
had
been
guided
to
me
by
its
light
one
night
in
indiana
when
it
had
rained
heavily
throughout
the
day
i
had
made
my
fire
and
camped
under
a
thick
leaved
tree
where
the
ground
was
dryer
than
in
the
open
sometime
about
midnight
i
felt
myself
roughly
shaken
at
the
same
time
a
sudden
shower
fell
that
pinned
me
breathless
to
the
earth
i
looked
here
and
there
but
could
see
no
one
then
i
left
the
shelter
of
the
tree
and
saw
to
my
surprise
that
the
night
was
fine
and
that
the
stars
were
thick
and
shining
as
i
replenished
the
fire
with
wood
of
which
i
always
gathered
in
an
abundance
before
darkness
came
it
puzzled
me
much
to
account
for
this
although
i
thought
the
shaking
must
have
been
a
dream
my
wet
clothes
were
a
sufficient
proof
of
the
rain
reality
every
man
i
met
on
the
following
day
enquired
where
i
had
lodged
during
the
earthquake
shock
on
the
previous
night
and
that
question
explained
everything
the
earth
had
shaken
me
and
the
leaves
of
the
tree
which
had
been
gathering
all
day
the
rain
drops
had
in
one
moment
relinquished
them
all
upon
my
sleeping
form
on
reaching
louis
i
still
had
something
like
forty
dollars
and
being
tired
of
my
own
thoughts
which
continually
upbraided
me
for
wasted
time
resolved
to
seek
some
congenial
fellowship
so
that
in
listening
to
other
men
thoughts
i
might
be
rendered
deaf
to
my
own
i
had
bought
a
daily
paper
and
had
gone
to
the
levee
so
that
i
might
spend
a
few
hours
out
of
the
sun
reading
and
watching
the
traffic
on
the
river
seeing
before
me
a
large
pile
of
lumber
i
hastened
towards
it
that
i
might
enjoy
its
shady
side
when
i
arrived
i
saw
that
the
place
was
already
occupied
by
two
strangers
one
being
a
man
of
middle
age
and
the
other
a
youth
of
gentlemanly
appearance
seating
myself
i
began
to
read
but
soon
had
my
attention
drawn
to
their
conversation
the
young
fellow
wanting
to
go
home
and
being
in
no
great
hurry
proposed
buying
a
and
floating
leisurely
down
the
mississippi
to
new
orleans
from
which
place
he
would
then
take
train
to
southern
texas
where
his
home
was
we
will
go
ashore
he
said
and
see
the
different
towns
and
take
in
fresh
provisions
as
they
are
needed
the
elder
of
the
two
who
had
a
strong
scotch
accent
allowed
a
little
enthusiasm
to
ooze
out
of
his
dry
temperament
and
agreed
without
much
comment
excuse
me
gentlemen
i
said
i
could
not
help
but
hear
your
conversation
and
if
you
have
no
objection
would
like
to
share
expenses
and
enjoy
your
company
on
such
a
trip
the
texan
being
young
and
impetuous
without
the
least
suspicion
of
strangers
jumped
to
his
feet
exulting
at
the
social
project
scotty
more
calm
but
with
a
shrewd
eye
to
the
financial
side
of
the
question
said
that
he
thought
the
trip
would
certainly
be
enjoyed
better
by
three
and
that
the
expense
would
not
be
near
so
great
per
head
we
had
no
difficulty
in
purchasing
a
hundreds
of
these
are
moored
to
the
banks
lived
in
by
fishermen
and
their
wives
and
others
in
various
ways
employed
on
the
river
but
of
course
the
one
we
required
was
to
be
much
smaller
than
these
we
found
one
at
last
rather
battered
and
for
which
we
were
asked
eleven
dollars
scotty
to
our
unfeigned
disgust
acted
the
jew
in
this
matter
of
trade
and
had
succeeded
in
beating
the
price
down
to
nine
dollars
and
a
half
when
we
to
his
annoyance
offered
to
pay
that
sum
without
more
ado
but
scotty
although
mean
in
these
business
matters
was
strictly
honest
and
just
in
paying
an
equal
share
for
after
i
had
paid
the
odd
half
a
dollar
he
did
not
forget
that
amount
when
we
came
to
stocking
the
boat
with
provisions
we
lost
no
time
in
getting
these
and
then
went
ashore
for
the
enjoyment
and
the
night
sleep
intending
to
start
early
the
next
morning
and
with
these
prospects
before
us
a
very
pleasant
evening
we
had
at
nine
the
following
morning
we
weighed
anchor
our
anchor
being
a
large
stone
and
drifted
into
the
current
the
young
texan
using
an
oar
as
a
tiller
and
what
a
strange
voyage
we
had
fraught
with
more
danger
than
many
would
dream
this
mississippi
river
often
had
only
a
few
yards
for
navigation
purposes
even
when
the
distance
from
bank
to
bank
was
between
two
and
three
miles
sometimes
we
were
in
the
middle
of
this
broad
river
and
yet
were
in
extreme
danger
of
floundering
for
we
could
touch
the
bottom
with
a
short
stick
yes
we
were
in
danger
of
floundering
and
yet
our
ship
drew
less
than
six
inches
of
water
trees
whose
branches
were
firmly
embedded
in
the
mud
had
their
roots
bobbing
up
and
down
bobbing
up
unawares
and
we
were
often
in
danger
of
being
impaled
on
one
of
these
ere
we
could
steer
clear
of
it
sometimes
we
would
see
villages
and
small
towns
that
in
the
remote
past
had
been
built
flush
on
the
banks
of
this
river
now
they
were
lying
quiet
and
neglected
a
mile
or
more
away
owing
to
the
river
determination
to
take
his
own
course
hundreds
of
lives
had
been
sacrificed
dying
of
swamp
fever
in
building
levees
and
high
banks
to
prevent
this
and
millions
of
dollars
utilised
for
the
same
purpose
but
the
father
of
waters
has
hitherto
had
his
own
will
and
can
be
expected
to
be
seen
at
any
place
and
at
any
time
towards
evening
we
would
put
ashore
on
a
sand
bar
making
a
fire
with
the
driftwood
of
which
there
was
an
abundance
here
we
cooked
supper
slept
and
enjoyed
breakfast
the
next
morning
there
was
no
other
water
to
be
had
than
that
of
the
river
which
the
natives
of
the
south
claim
to
be
healthy
we
had
no
objection
to
using
it
for
cooking
and
washing
but
it
was
certainly
too
thick
for
drinking
cold
or
rather
lukewarm
for
it
was
never
cold
in
the
summer
months
we
would
fill
a
large
can
and
let
the
water
settle
for
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
and
after
taking
great
care
in
drinking
a
sediment
of
mud
would
be
left
at
the
bottom
a
quarter
or
of
an
inch
deep
we
put
ashore
at
one
place
where
a
number
of
negroes
and
white
men
had
assembled
in
expectation
of
work
when
man
again
proposed
putting
forth
his
puny
strength
against
the
mississippi
where
we
decided
to
wait
a
day
or
two
and
take
our
chance
of
being
employed
unfortunately
the
ill
feeling
which
invariably
exists
between
these
two
colours
came
to
a
climax
on
the
first
day
of
our
arrival
the
negroes
insulting
and
arrogant
through
their
superiority
of
numbers
became
at
last
unbearable
on
which
the
white
men
having
that
truer
courage
that
scorned
to
count
their
own
strength
assembled
together
and
after
a
few
moments
consultation
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
provocation
this
came
sooner
than
was
expected
a
negro
affecting
to
be
intoxicated
staggered
against
a
white
man
and
was
promptly
knocked
down
for
his
trouble
the
negroes
whose
favourite
weapon
is
the
razor
produced
these
useful
blades
from
different
parts
of
concealment
stood
irresolute
waiting
for
a
leader
and
then
came
forward
in
a
body
led
by
a
big
swaggerer
in
bare
feet
whose
apparel
consisted
of
a
red
shirt
and
a
pair
of
patched
trousers
held
up
by
a
single
brace
these
white
men
who
were
so
far
outnumbered
said
little
but
the
negroes
were
loud
in
their
abuse
this
soon
led
to
blows
and
in
the
ensuing
fight
knives
razors
and
fists
were
freely
used
only
one
shot
was
fired
and
that
one
told
when
the
negroes
whose
courage
had
failed
at
such
a
determined
resistance
were
in
full
flight
the
tall
swaggerer
was
left
behind
with
a
bullet
in
his
heart
several
men
were
wounded
with
gashes
on
necks
arms
and
different
parts
of
the
body
small
fights
continued
throughout
the
day
but
it
was
left
for
the
night
to
produce
a
deed
of
foul
murder
a
white
man
was
found
next
morning
with
his
body
covered
with
blood
from
wounds
half
a
dozen
razors
must
have
set
to
work
on
him
in
the
dark
the
razor
is
a
sly
weapon
but
is
far
less
dangerous
than
a
knife
a
poker
or
even
a
short
heavy
piece
of
wood
and
as
it
can
not
pierce
to
the
heart
or
brain
that
is
why
this
man
took
so
long
in
the
killing
this
deed
roused
the
sheriff
and
his
marshal
and
they
followed
the
black
murderers
to
the
adjoining
state
but
returned
next
day
without
them
we
embarked
again
but
owing
to
the
young
texan
being
taken
sick
with
malarial
fever
resolved
to
put
ashore
for
medicine
at
the
first
large
town
this
malarial
fever
is
very
prevalent
in
these
parts
especially
this
state
of
arkansas
which
is
three
parts
a
swamp
he
suffered
so
much
that
we
decided
to
call
on
the
first
seen
and
ask
assistance
of
the
fishermen
and
soon
we
had
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
seeing
a
large
moored
at
the
mouth
of
a
small
creek
we
put
the
tiller
which
as
i
have
said
was
an
oar
to
its
proper
work
and
sculled
towards
the
shore
we
ran
to
land
within
ten
yards
of
the
other
boat
and
the
fisherman
who
had
seen
us
coming
stood
waiting
on
the
sands
to
know
our
wants
he
was
a
typical
swamp
man
with
a
dark
sickly
complexion
and
and
though
he
was
nearly
six
feet
in
height
his
weight
i
believe
could
not
have
exceeded
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
his
left
cheek
was
considerably
swollen
which
i
thought
must
be
due
to
neuralgia
until
the
swelling
began
to
disappear
from
that
side
and
after
witnessing
for
a
few
seconds
a
frightful
even
painful
contortion
of
the
face
i
saw
the
right
cheek
come
into
possession
of
the
same
beautiful
round
curve
leaving
the
left
cheek
as
its
fellow
had
been
it
was
now
apparent
that
the
one
object
of
this
man
life
was
to
chew
tobacco
to
him
we
related
our
troubles
asking
his
advice
and
for
a
little
temporary
assistance
for
which
he
would
be
paid
up
to
the
present
time
he
had
not
opened
his
lips
except
a
right
or
left
corner
to
squirt
tobacco
juice
sending
an
equal
share
to
the
north
and
south
i
guess
there
some
quinine
in
the
shanty
boat
he
said
after
a
long
silence
which
i
reckon
will
relieve
him
considerably
but
he
ought
ter
go
home
ter
th
women
folk
that
straight
he
led
the
way
to
his
boat
and
we
followed
we
soon
had
the
young
texan
in
comfort
and
scotty
and
myself
returned
to
transfer
some
provisions
to
the
fisherman
for
the
evening
use
while
doing
so
we
decided
to
sell
our
own
boat
at
any
price
when
we
would
walk
to
the
nearest
railroad
and
send
the
young
fellow
home
after
which
we
would
seek
some
employment
and
settle
down
we
cooked
supper
and
then
slept
in
the
open
air
beside
a
large
fire
leaving
our
sick
friend
comfortable
in
the
boat
the
next
morning
we
offered
our
for
sale
for
six
dollars
with
all
its
belongings
the
fisherman
explained
to
us
that
he
not
only
had
no
money
but
rarely
had
use
for
it
everything
he
needed
he
paid
for
in
fish
and
often
went
months
at
a
time
without
a
glimpse
of
money
of
any
description
to
my
surprise
the
one
thing
that
did
seem
to
claim
his
attention
for
which
he
could
not
help
but
display
some
greed
was
the
large
stone
which
we
had
brought
with
us
from
louis
and
which
we
had
used
for
anchor
this
stone
certainly
had
no
vein
of
gold
or
silver
in
it
it
was
not
granite
or
marble
and
could
boast
of
no
beauty
being
a
very
ordinary
looking
stone
indeed
but
it
seemed
to
have
a
strange
fascination
for
this
man
the
fisherman
had
no
money
and
had
nothing
to
barter
which
might
be
of
use
to
us
so
we
made
him
a
present
of
the
whole
lot
and
left
him
sitting
on
the
stone
watching
our
departure
he
seemed
very
eager
to
possess
that
stone
i
remarked
to
scotty
as
we
followed
a
trail
through
a
thicket
so
that
we
might
reach
the
yes
said
scotty
for
in
this
part
of
the
country
where
there
is
little
but
sand
wood
and
mud
a
stone
a
piece
of
iron
or
any
small
thing
of
weight
can
be
put
to
many
uses
after
reaching
the
road
we
had
twenty
miles
to
walk
to
reach
the
nearest
railway
station
at
which
place
we
arrived
late
that
night
the
young
texan
being
then
weak
and
exhausted
a
train
was
leaving
at
midnight
for
new
orleans
and
after
seeing
him
safely
aboard
we
sat
in
the
station
till
daybreak
early
the
next
morning
we
were
examining
the
town
waiting
for
business
to
start
so
that
we
might
enquire
as
to
its
prospects
for
work
this
seemed
to
be
good
there
being
a
large
stave
factory
which
employed
a
number
of
men
we
succeeded
in
our
quest
starting
to
work
that
morning
and
at
dinner
time
received
a
note
of
introduction
to
an
hotel
that
evening
we
associated
with
our
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
we
discovered
that
there
was
no
particular
time
to
receive
wages
there
being
no
regular
pay
day
sometimes
wages
ran
on
for
a
month
six
weeks
two
months
etc
at
the
present
time
no
man
had
received
wages
for
over
two
months
of
course
he
explained
to
us
anything
you
require
you
can
easily
get
an
order
for
on
the
stores
we
worked
two
weeks
at
this
factory
when
i
was
taken
ill
myself
with
malaria
and
not
being
able
to
eat
soon
became
too
weak
for
work
in
this
condition
i
went
to
the
office
for
my
money
but
could
not
get
it
and
saw
that
nothing
else
could
be
done
than
to
get
an
order
on
the
stores
and
take
my
wages
out
in
clothes
shoes
etc
scotty
was
scared
at
this
and
quitted
work
at
once
to
demand
his
wages
in
cash
and
there
i
left
him
waiting
for
a
settlement
i
intended
going
to
memphis
the
nearest
large
town
and
placing
myself
in
its
hospital
whilst
scotty
was
going
to
new
orleans
where
i
promised
to
meet
him
in
a
month
providing
i
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
do
so
i
do
know
what
possessed
me
to
walk
out
of
this
town
instead
of
taking
a
train
but
this
i
did
to
my
regret
for
i
became
too
weak
to
move
and
coming
to
a
large
swamp
i
left
the
railroad
and
crawled
into
it
and
for
three
days
and
the
same
number
of
nights
lay
there
without
energy
to
continue
my
journey
wild
hungry
hogs
were
there
who
approached
dangerously
near
but
ran
snorting
away
when
my
body
moved
a
score
or
more
of
buzzards
had
perched
waiting
on
the
branches
above
me
and
i
knew
that
the
place
was
teeming
with
snakes
i
suffered
from
a
terrible
thirst
and
drank
of
the
stagnant
water
that
was
full
of
germs
and
had
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
one
dose
of
which
would
have
poisoned
some
men
to
death
when
the
chill
was
upon
me
i
crawled
into
the
hot
sun
and
lay
there
shivering
with
the
cold
and
when
the
hot
fever
possessed
me
i
crawled
back
into
the
shade
not
a
morsel
to
eat
for
four
days
and
very
little
for
several
days
previous
i
could
see
the
trains
pass
this
way
and
that
but
had
not
the
strength
to
call
most
of
the
trains
whistled
and
i
knew
that
they
stopped
either
for
water
or
coal
within
a
mile
of
where
i
lay
knowing
this
to
be
the
case
and
certain
that
it
would
be
death
to
remain
longer
in
this
deadly
swamp
i
managed
to
reach
the
railroad
track
and
succeeded
in
reaching
the
next
station
where
most
of
these
trains
stopped
the
distance
had
been
less
than
a
mile
but
it
had
taken
me
two
hours
to
accomplish
i
then
paid
my
way
from
this
station
being
in
a
hurry
to
reach
memphis
thinking
my
life
was
at
its
close
when
i
reached
that
town
i
took
a
conveyance
from
the
station
to
the
hospital
at
that
place
my
condition
was
considered
to
be
very
serious
but
the
doctor
always
bore
me
in
mind
for
we
were
both
of
the
same
nationality
and
to
that
i
believe
i
owe
my
speedy
recovery
chapter
xv
a
lynching
upon
leaving
the
hospital
i
remained
several
days
in
memphis
spending
most
of
my
hours
enjoying
the
shade
and
sunshine
of
a
small
park
which
is
pleasantly
situated
in
the
main
portion
of
that
town
one
morning
while
doing
this
i
was
accosted
by
one
whom
i
soon
recognised
as
a
fellow
worker
of
mine
in
the
stave
factory
from
him
i
learnt
that
the
firm
had
smashed
no
pay
day
had
come
and
the
stores
had
all
absolutely
refused
to
honour
the
firm
orders
while
some
men
had
left
the
town
disgusted
and
others
were
patiently
waiting
a
settlement
that
would
never
come
this
man
was
going
north
so
i
left
him
at
memphis
intending
to
beat
my
way
to
new
orleans
and
from
that
town
to
the
state
of
texas
these
states
of
tennessee
arkansas
mississippi
and
louisiana
are
the
homes
of
the
negroes
of
old
it
is
a
strange
contrast
to
see
the
old
negroes
who
in
their
young
days
were
slaves
reverently
raising
their
hats
to
any
seedy
looking
white
man
whom
they
meet
calling
him
such
titles
as
captain
major
colonel
and
even
general
and
the
half
defiant
gloom
of
the
free
young
generations
who
are
still
in
some
respects
slaves
to
the
white
men
these
negroes
lived
in
small
wooden
shanties
and
rarely
received
money
for
their
labour
they
worked
for
the
planter
at
so
much
a
day
this
gentleman
kept
on
the
plantation
a
large
general
store
and
supplied
their
wants
at
such
an
exorbitant
price
that
the
negroes
were
seldom
out
of
debt
when
the
busy
season
commenced
in
the
cities
silk
would
be
far
cheaper
than
the
common
flimsy
muslin
which
poor
black
dinah
so
much
coveted
from
her
store
i
have
heard
many
an
old
negro
say
that
he
was
far
worse
off
as
a
freeman
than
as
a
slave
the
prisons
in
the
north
were
like
hotels
but
here
in
the
south
went
to
the
extreme
of
cruelty
in
some
places
a
man
would
be
tried
and
perhaps
fined
ten
dollars
and
costs
a
citizen
having
need
of
a
cheap
labourer
would
pay
this
fine
take
possession
of
the
prisoner
and
make
him
work
out
his
fine
on
the
farm
this
citizen
would
buy
the
prisoner
cheap
overalls
dungarees
shirts
shoes
for
a
few
dollars
and
charge
the
prisoner
four
times
their
amount
the
prisoner
was
not
free
to
refuse
these
and
being
forced
to
work
out
their
price
was
kept
in
this
way
twice
the
number
of
his
days
i
was
very
much
afraid
of
all
this
although
a
wandering
white
man
was
not
in
nearly
so
much
danger
as
a
negro
some
days
after
leaving
memphis
i
arrived
at
a
small
town
where
i
was
surprised
to
see
an
unusual
amount
of
bustle
the
surrounding
country
for
miles
having
sent
in
all
its
able
bodied
men
every
man
was
armed
with
a
gun
and
they
stood
in
small
groups
talking
outside
the
various
stores
it
seemed
as
though
there
had
been
rumours
of
an
invasion
and
that
these
men
were
organising
to
defend
their
homes
and
country
but
i
had
not
the
least
idea
of
what
had
really
happened
the
small
groups
now
began
to
join
together
into
larger
ones
and
the
larger
groups
joined
until
they
became
one
large
body
of
men
this
one
body
then
shouldered
guns
and
moved
quickly
along
the
main
street
the
men
faces
being
drawn
and
pale
i
followed
on
perhaps
the
one
unarmed
man
among
them
curious
to
know
the
meaning
of
it
all
they
came
at
last
to
a
halt
and
to
see
the
reason
for
this
i
stepped
across
the
way
and
saw
that
they
had
halted
before
a
large
building
which
by
its
barred
windows
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
as
the
jail
one
man
had
curled
around
his
shoulders
a
long
rope
and
this
man
with
two
others
knocked
loudly
with
the
butt
ends
of
their
guns
on
the
prison
door
almost
in
an
instant
the
door
was
flung
wide
open
and
the
sheriff
stood
in
the
open
way
to
know
their
wants
the
men
must
have
demanded
the
prison
keys
for
i
saw
the
sheriff
at
once
produce
them
which
he
handed
to
these
men
without
the
least
show
of
resistance
this
man
with
the
rope
and
several
others
then
entered
the
jail
and
the
silent
crowd
without
cast
their
eyes
in
that
direction
up
to
the
present
time
i
had
not
heard
a
distinct
voice
nothing
but
the
buzz
of
low
whispering
but
suddenly
from
the
interior
there
came
a
loud
shriek
and
a
voice
crying
for
mercy
men
now
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
dragging
after
them
a
negro
at
the
end
of
a
rope
this
unfortunate
wretch
was
possessed
of
a
terror
that
is
seldom
seen
in
a
human
being
he
fell
on
his
knees
to
pray
but
was
jerked
to
his
feet
ere
he
could
murmur
the
first
words
o
lord
he
staggered
to
and
fro
and
sideways
at
the
same
time
howling
and
jabbering
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
showing
the
horrible
white
of
his
eyes
i
can
well
understand
a
man
screaming
trembling
and
crying
for
mercy
when
actually
enduring
bodily
pain
but
that
one
should
show
such
a
terror
at
the
thought
of
it
filled
me
more
with
disgust
than
pity
that
this
prisoner
should
have
been
so
brutal
and
unfeeling
in
inflicting
pain
on
another
and
should
now
show
so
much
cowardice
in
anticipation
of
receiving
punishment
inadequate
to
his
offence
dried
in
me
the
milk
of
human
kindness
and
banished
my
first
thoughts
which
had
been
to
escape
this
horrible
scene
without
witnessing
its
end
for
it
was
now
i
remembered
reading
of
this
man
offence
and
it
was
of
the
most
brutal
kind
being
much
like
the
work
of
a
wild
beast
they
now
marched
him
from
the
jail
their
strong
arms
supporting
his
terror
stricken
limbs
but
no
man
reviled
him
with
his
tongue
and
i
saw
no
cowardly
hand
strike
him
soon
they
came
to
a
group
of
trees
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
choosing
the
largest
of
these
they
threw
the
rope
end
over
its
strongest
branch
the
prisoner
at
the
same
time
crying
for
mercy
and
trying
to
throw
his
body
full
on
the
ground
when
this
was
done
a
dozen
hands
caught
the
rope
end
made
one
quick
jerk
and
the
prisoner
body
was
struggling
in
the
air
then
all
these
men
shouldered
their
guns
fired
one
volley
and
in
a
second
the
body
was
hanging
lifeless
with
a
hundred
shots
in
five
minutes
after
this
nothing
but
the
corpse
remained
to
tell
of
what
had
occurred
the
men
having
quietly
scattered
towards
their
homes
a
few
days
after
this
i
was
in
new
orleans
intending
to
spend
a
week
or
two
in
that
city
before
i
started
on
my
journey
to
texas
it
was
in
this
city
three
days
after
my
arrival
that
i
became
the
victim
of
an
outrage
which
was
as
unsatisfactory
to
others
as
to
myself
having
been
to
the
theatre
and
being
on
my
way
back
home
late
at
night
half
a
dozen
men
whom
i
scarcely
had
time
to
recognise
as
negroes
sprang
from
a
dark
corner
and
without
saying
a
word
or
giving
the
least
chance
of
escape
or
defence
biffed
and
banged
at
my
face
and
head
until
i
fell
unconscious
at
their
feet
their
motive
without
a
doubt
was
robbery
but
having
my
money
concealed
in
a
belt
next
to
my
body
they
had
to
be
satisfied
with
a
five
cent
piece
which
was
all
my
pockets
contained
such
brutal
outrages
as
these
are
seldom
committed
by
white
men
who
having
the
more
cool
courage
demand
a
man
money
at
the
commencement
and
do
not
resort
to
violence
except
it
be
their
victim
wish
but
this
not
very
intelligent
race
half
murder
a
man
without
being
sure
of
anything
for
their
pains
white
men
will
search
a
man
as
he
stands
and
if
he
possesses
nothing
he
may
go
his
way
uninjured
followed
perhaps
by
a
curse
or
two
of
disappointment
but
these
negroes
prefer
to
murder
a
man
first
and
then
to
search
the
dead
body
they
are
certainly
born
thieves
on
the
river
boats
that
ply
the
mississippi
from
louis
to
new
orleans
which
are
all
manned
by
negroes
with
the
exception
of
those
holding
the
higher
offices
a
negro
thief
will
often
spoil
a
six
dollar
pair
of
trousers
in
robbing
his
victim
of
a
cent
piece
when
a
man
is
asleep
the
negro
will
bend
over
him
feeling
the
outside
of
his
trousers
where
the
pockets
are
if
he
feels
the
shape
of
a
coin
instead
of
working
his
fingers
carefully
into
the
mouth
of
the
pocket
he
takes
out
his
razor
and
holding
the
coin
with
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
cuts
it
out
bringing
away
coin
part
of
the
lining
pocket
and
trousers
when
the
victim
wakes
he
or
some
one
else
sees
the
hole
and
they
at
once
know
the
meaning
of
it
i
remember
a
trip
on
one
of
these
boats
when
a
white
man
feigned
a
sleep
lying
on
his
back
on
a
bale
of
cotton
with
his
hands
in
his
coat
pockets
in
his
right
pocket
was
a
revolver
which
his
right
hand
held
ready
cocked
for
use
these
negroes
are
always
on
the
look
out
for
sleepers
and
one
of
these
thieves
was
soon
bending
over
his
expected
victim
he
had
felt
a
coin
and
taking
out
his
razor
was
in
the
act
of
cutting
it
out
when
there
was
a
sharp
report
and
the
negro
fell
back
shot
through
the
brain
the
supposed
sleeper
quietly
rose
to
his
feet
and
when
the
captain
and
some
officers
came
he
simply
pointed
to
the
negro
and
the
fallen
razor
and
no
other
explanation
was
needed
at
the
next
stopping
place
the
captain
had
a
few
words
with
the
authorities
and
the
dead
body
was
taken
ashore
but
the
white
passenger
continued
his
journey
without
being
bothered
about
a
trial
or
examination
there
was
no
more
thieving
during
that
trip
i
soon
left
new
orleans
being
possessed
with
a
restless
spirit
and
after
visiting
galveston
euston
and
many
more
towns
of
less
importance
i
made
my
way
through
the
heart
of
texas
to
the
town
of
paris
which
lies
on
the
borders
of
the
indian
territory
it
was
in
a
saloon
in
the
main
street
of
this
town
that
i
had
my
attention
drawn
to
a
glass
case
wherein
was
seen
hanging
a
cord
at
the
end
of
which
was
something
that
looked
very
much
like
a
walnut
on
looking
closer
i
saw
a
small
heap
of
dust
at
the
bottom
seeing
that
this
case
contained
no
stuffed
animal
nor
any
model
of
ingenious
mechanism
i
began
to
read
the
printed
matter
curious
for
an
explanation
this
small
thing
dangling
at
the
end
of
the
cord
purported
to
be
the
heart
of
a
negro
whom
the
people
had
some
time
previously
burned
at
the
stake
he
had
suffered
a
terrible
death
so
had
his
little
victim
a
mere
child
of
a
few
years
who
had
been
found
in
the
woods
torn
limb
from
limb
this
negro
had
been
arrested
by
the
sheriff
and
sentenced
to
a
short
term
adequate
to
his
offence
after
he
had
been
released
he
had
taken
his
revenge
on
the
sheriff
child
bearing
her
off
when
on
her
way
to
school
the
sheriff
wife
being
the
child
mother
had
with
her
own
hand
applied
the
torch
to
this
monster
and
if
her
hand
had
failed
any
woman
in
this
land
of
many
millions
would
have
willingly
done
her
this
service
i
left
paris
that
night
catching
a
fast
cattle
train
and
arrived
the
following
morning
at
fort
smith
arkansas
bill
cook
the

the
camp
who
would
have
dreamt
that
so
many
well
known
beggars
would
have
met
together
at
one
camp
without
any
prearranged
plans
the
time
was
morning
and
the
scene
was
on
the
outskirts
of
pittsburg
and
the
characters
were
philadelphia
slim
and
wee
shorty
who
had
all
night
ridden
the
freight
car
and
had
now
dismounted
near
the
camp
which
they
knew
of
old
they
both
had
cold
victuals
in
plenty
with
dry
coffee
and
sugar
and
they
were
not
long
in
making
a
blaze
and
fetching
water
from
the
spring
before
they
were
seated
comfortably
to
their
breakfast
after
which
they
intended
to
sleep
for
they
were
more
weary
than
working
men
they
were
not
without
money
for
wee
shorty
and
slim
had
the
day
previous
been
encamped
with
others
about
a
hundred
miles
from
the
present
spot
at
which
place
there
had
come
to
the
camp
an
unfortunate
blacksmith
who
possessed
society
papers
but
lacked
courage
to
beg
with
them
on
which
wee
shorty
had
conceived
a
most
daring
plan
which
was
to
borrow
the
aforesaid
papers
with
the
blacksmith
consent
and
to
make
his
way
to
the
nearest
blacksmith
shop
with
this
idea
in
his
mind
the
wee
man
had
bound
his
hand
in
white
linen
so
that
he
could
plead
disablement
in
case
the
blacksmith
doubted
him
to
be
the
legitimate
owner
of
the
papers
and
to
prove
his
veracity
would
test
him
with
a
little
job
after
binding
his
hand
in
this
way
wee
shorty
who
was
no
more
than
five
feet
in
height
and
who
had
small
white
hands
and
a
pale
face
and
whose
weight
never
exceeded
seven
stone
and
a
half
and
who
looked
more
like
a
sickly
tailor
than
a
blacksmith
after
taking
this
precaution
wee
shorty
made
his
way
to
the
blacksmith
shop
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
he
had
returned
with
a
dollar
in
small
change
and
had
returned
the
poor
blacksmith
his
papers
and
generously
given
him
of
his
makings
yes
it
would
indeed
be
a
hard
town
if
this
wee
fellow
failed
to
make
money
as
i
have
already
said
slim
and
the
artful
one
were
tired
after
their
night
ride
and
they
were
well
pleased
to
find
the
camp
unoccupied
by
strangers
but
they
had
scarcely
made
their
coffee
and
swallowed
the
first
mouthful
when
the
dried
twigs
were
heard
to
crack
beneath
a
heavy
tread
and
the
next
moment
there
walked
into
the
camp
the
indian
kid
whom
the
present
proprietors
had
not
seen
for
over
twelve
months
what
a
meeting
was
there
and
what
confidences
were
exchanged
there
was
good
reason
for
the
kid
not
having
been
seen
for
he
had
been
incarcerated
in
a
jail
he
had
committed
his
first
and
last
burglary
which
had
not
been
done
with
an
eye
to
profit
but
out
of
a
mean
spirit
of
revenge
he
had
been
refused
charity
at
a
house
and
on
leaving
the
place
had
spied
a
small
outhouse
in
which
he
saw
many
things
easy
to
carry
and
easily
to
be
converted
into
money
bearing
this
in
mind
he
had
returned
after
dark
scaled
the
back
wall
and
was
soon
in
possession
of
a
large
bundle
consisting
of
shirts
frocks
shoes
and
various
carpenter
tools
all
this
had
been
done
through
a
spirit
of
revenge
for
the
kid
swore
that
he
could
have
begged
the
worth
of
the
bundle
in
half
an
hour
being
in
possession
of
that
bundle
at
that
strange
hour
of
the
night
he
was
afraid
to
carry
it
into
the
town
for
fear
that
the
police
would
enquire
his
business
so
he
hid
it
in
the
bushes
which
in
the
night
looked
so
dark
and
thick
after
which
he
had
artfully
walked
some
distance
away
and
laid
himself
down
to
sleep
until
morning
it
must
have
been
daylight
for
several
hours
when
the
kid
rose
hastily
and
went
in
quest
of
his
bundle
but
the
bundle
had
disappeared
and
the
kid
had
been
cruelly
robbed
by
early
workmen
he
at
first
thought
who
had
spied
the
bundle
in
the
bushes
which
appeared
so
much
less
heavy
by
day
than
by
night
however
it
was
not
the
early
workman
who
had
done
this
but
a
plain
clothes
policeman
who
still
hid
behind
the
bushes
and
seeing
the
kid
searching
for
his
bundle
sprang
from
concealment
saying
you
are
looking
for
a
bundle
and
i
am
looking
for
you
such
was
the
story
recited
at
great
pains
for
he
often
rambled
in
his
discourse
to
laud
himself
as
a
successful
beggar
who
would
on
no
account
commit
burglary
for
profit
all
of
which
accounted
for
his
twelve
months
disappearance
his
story
was
scarcely
at
an
end
when
who
should
walk
into
the
camp
but
windy
the
talkative
windy
whose
tongue
had
entertained
many
a
camp
with
strange
and
unique
experiences
of
course
at
his
heels
was
pennsylvania
dutch
a
faithful
friend
enough
but
a
poor
beggar
who
was
no
more
than
a
pensioner
on
windy
bounty
and
acted
the
part
of
a
but
there
was
another
surprise
to
follow
for
english
harry
who
had
been
in
pittsburg
for
some
time
past
having
now
walked
out
of
the
city
to
take
a
glance
at
the
camp
walked
into
it
at
this
very
time
and
to
his
astonishment
and
joy
found
the
place
in
possession
of
good
beggars
instead
of
common
work
seekers
as
he
had
at
first
feared
only
imagine
all
these
notorious
men
meeting
together
haphazard
in
this
manner
they
could
scarcely
recover
their
astonishment
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
but
to
make
a
muster
of
what
money
was
in
the
camp
and
to
send
pennsylvania
dutch
for
its
worth
in
whisky
so
as
to
celebrate
such
an
event
by
a
carousal
this
was
at
once
done
and
windy
pensioner
shook
off
his
laziness
from
head
to
foot
which
made
wee
shorty
sarcastically
remark
dutchy
would
rather
buy
than
beg
to
which
windy
in
a
voice
of
despair
answered
he
will
never
make
a
beggar
and
if
i
did
not
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
him
or
anything
occurred
to
part
us
he
would
live
in
orchards
and
turnip
fields
until
he
saw
a
chance
to
become
a
working
man
he
confessed
when
i
first
met
him
that
he
had
lived
for
ten
days
on
green
corn
and
apples
so
i
took
him
in
hand
and
kept
him
thinking
my
example
would
rouse
him
to
action
but
it
was
of
no
use
for
the
poor
fellow
has
not
the
heart
however
i
never
forget
poor
dutchy
when
i
am
foraging
said
windy
rather
tenderly
it
was
not
long
before
the
object
of
these
remarks
returned
and
placed
before
his
companions
two
bottles
of
whisky
now
boys
said
windy
after
he
had
become
affected
by
several
lots
of
spirits
now
boys
i
propose
that
we
hold
this
camp
down
for
a
whole
week
and
we
will
all
rag
up
meaning
that
they
would
beg
clothes
and
put
on
the
appearance
of
gentlemen
his
proposal
was
unanimously
seconded
and
was
quickly
followed
by
a
suggestion
from
the
indian
kid
that
they
should
finish
the
whisky
which
also
met
with
no
objection
we
will
hold
the
camp
cried
windy
against
all
comers
they
would
certainly
find
no
necessity
for
defending
their
privacy
for
one
glance
at
these
six
men
especially
in
their
present
condition
would
have
been
sufficient
to
deter
any
person
from
entering
this
camp
was
now
far
more
private
than
brown
house
in
town
who
had
a
neighbour
that
never
entered
other
people
doors
without
first
knocking
but
which
neighbour
never
gave
brown
or
any
one
else
the
chance
to
remove
sundry
things
that
were
better
concealed
nor
waited
to
hear
the
cry
come
in
for
she
entered
as
she
knocked
saying
do
be
alarmed
brown
it
is
only
mrs
white
alas
the
whisky
soon
gave
out
and
there
was
no
more
money
and
what
was
to
be
done
i
propose
said
english
harry
that
we
leave
pennsylvania
dutch
in
charge
of
the
camp
while
we
go
out
foraging
for
an
hour
to
this
they
all
agreed
and
made
their
way
towards
the
town
on
reaching
the
suburbs
they
divided
and
went
in
different
directions
with
the
understanding
that
each
man
should
be
returned
to
the
camp
in
less
than
two
hours
and
that
each
one
should
have
no
less
than
half
a
dollar
how
it
was
done
was
a
mystery
but
wee
shorty
was
back
in
less
than
an
hour
not
only
with
half
a
dollar
but
with
twenty
cents
worth
of
whisky
in
a
bottle
he
was
soon
followed
by
windy
who
had
begged
cents
after
which
came
in
english
harry
and
the
indian
kid
together
each
with
half
a
dollar
but
where
was
philadelphia
slim
wee
shorty
boon
companion
for
these
were
good
beggars
all
who
could
have
almost
persuaded
the
birds
to
feed
them
in
the
wilderness
and
slim
was
by
no
means
the
worst
even
though
the
wee
man
was
by
a
small
degree
the
best
until
they
knew
the
fate
of
poor
slim
they
felt
very
little
inclination
to
continue
their
carousal
it
might
have
been
of
an
hour
after
the
return
of
english
harry
and
the
kid
when
they
heard
a
step
coming
through
the
bush
and
turning
their
eyes
that
way
were
soon
confronted
by
their
late
companion
slim
he
had
a
large
bundle
under
his
arm
but
to
the
surprise
and
anxiety
of
his
companions
was
holding
to
his
nose
a
pocket
handkerchief
who
has
done
that
slim
cried
wee
shorty
who
had
surreptitiously
fortified
himself
with
whisky
and
who
being
the
smallest
man
was
naturally
the
most
ferocious
who
has
done
that
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
and
with
his
hands
dangerously
clenched
standing
to
his
full
height
slim
did
not
answer
this
question
at
once
but
threw
down
his
bundle
after
which
he
produced
a
dollar
bill
and
placed
it
thereon
pointing
then
to
the
twain
with
his
right
hand
his
left
hand
still
being
occupied
with
his
bleeding
nose
he
said
here
is
a
suit
of
clothes
and
a
dollar
bill
and
i
have
well
earned
them
such
words
were
mysterious
to
his
associates
for
they
knew
that
slim
would
never
at
any
price
perform
labour
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion
in
their
own
minds
that
he
had
forcibly
taken
these
things
in
a
very
high
handed
fashion
and
had
suffered
in
the
act
what
a
disgrace
to
the
profession
after
enquiring
if
there
was
any
whisky
to
be
had
and
being
supplied
with
the
same
by
his
particular
friend
wee
shorty
slim
proposed
that
pennsylvania
dutch
should
be
again
despatched
with
all
speed
for
a
fresh
supply
seeing
this
done
he
then
seated
himself
and
proceeded
to
give
his
experience
it
seems
that
slim
had
had
more
difficulty
than
was
expected
a
full
half
hour
had
elapsed
and
slim
had
not
received
one
cent
although
he
had
told
his
pitiful
story
to
a
number
of
people
he
almost
began
to
despair
of
success
but
firmly
resolved
not
to
return
without
something
to
show
for
his
trouble
seeing
a
very
large
house
he
went
to
the
front
door
and
rang
the
bell
but
the
door
remained
unanswered
not
to
be
baffled
by
this
and
beginning
to
feel
desperate
he
made
his
way
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
was
just
about
to
knock
at
the
back
door
when
a
voice
hailed
him
from
an
adjoining
shed
turning
his
eyes
in
that
direction
he
saw
a
man
in
his
white
shirt
sleeves
who
seemed
to
be
the
master
of
the
house
now
as
slim
looked
across
he
saw
into
the
shed
and
behold
there
was
a
punching
ball
hanging
from
the
ceiling
which
was
still
moving
as
though
this
gentleman
had
only
that
moment
finished
practising
on
slim
explaining
his
wants
which
had
been
increasing
in
number
through
his
the
gentleman
quietly
went
to
a
shelf
and
taking
therefrom
a
pair
of
boxing
gloves
told
slim
that
if
he
would
oblige
him
with
ten
minutes
practice
with
the
same
he
would
reward
him
with
a
dollar
now
it
happened
that
these
things
were
not
entirely
unknown
to
slim
and
once
or
twice
in
his
life
he
had
actually
had
them
in
his
hands
but
not
on
and
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
could
do
but
very
little
hurt
therefore
he
donned
the
gloves
being
as
eager
to
earn
an
easy
dollar
as
the
master
of
the
house
was
eager
to
practise
alas
it
was
this
difference
in
their
motives
which
gave
the
gentleman
an
overwhelming
victory
and
poor
slim
a
bloody
nose
and
such
aching
bones
for
said
slim
to
us
suppose
i
had
knocked
him
out
who
was
to
pay
me
my
dollar
he
attacked
me
like
a
mad
bull
and
all
i
dare
do
was
to
act
on
the
defence
several
times
he
left
an
opening
which
had
i
taken
advantage
of
would
have
ended
in
his
collapse
and
if
he
had
died
there
had
been
no
witness
to
hear
what
bargain
had
been
made
between
us
being
at
such
a
disadvantage
as
i
was
slim
continued
he
would
no
doubt
have
made
matters
worse
if
my
nose
had
not
bled
which
i
began
to
wipe
with
the
gloves
seeing
this
he
was
afraid
my
blood
would
be
conveyed
by
means
of
gloves
to
his
own
person
so
he
asked
me
if
i
had
had
enough
i
thanked
him
that
i
had
and
as
we
made
our
way
towards
the
house
told
him
i
would
be
thankful
for
any
old
clothes
to
replace
my
own
which
were
now
stained
with
blood
he
seemed
to
be
so
pleased
at
having
drawn
my
blood
that
i
believe
he
would
have
given
me
anything
i
asked
for
here
are
the
clothes
but
i
do
know
what
they
are
like
such
was
slim
experience
on
an
inspection
of
the
bundle
it
was
found
to
contain
a
clean
shirt
a
pair
of
socks
two
handkerchiefs
and
an
almost
brand
new
suit
of
clothes
just
as
philadelphia
slim
ended
his
story
pennsylvania
dutch
returned
with
the
whisky
and
we
all
caroused
until
sleep
overpowered
us
chapter
xvii
home
i
had
now
been
in
the
united
states
of
america
something
like
five
years
working
here
and
there
as
the
inclination
seized
me
which
i
must
confess
was
not
often
i
was
certainly
getting
some
enjoyment
out
of
life
but
now
and
then
the
waste
of
time
appalled
me
for
i
still
had
a
conviction
that
i
was
born
to
a
different
life
the
knowledge
that
i
had
the
advantage
over
the
majority
of
strangers
in
that
country
often
consoled
me
when
feeling
depressed
for
my
old
grandmother
had
left
me
profit
of
a
small
estate
my
share
at
that
time
amounting
to
ten
shillings
per
week
and
during
these
five
years
i
had
not
drawn
one
penny
therefore
having
over
a
hundred
pounds
entered
to
my
account
so
when
one
would
say
how
much
he
desired
to
return
to
his
native
land
but
had
no
means
of
doing
so
i
would
then
explain
how
it
could
easily
be
done
on
the
cattle
boats
and
if
he
protested
saying
that
he
had
not
the
courage
to
return
penniless
after
so
many
years
abroad
although
i
had
no
answer
to
console
him
his
objection
was
a
pleasant
reminder
of
my
own
expectations
it
was
this
knowledge
that
made
me
so
idle
and
so
indifferent
to
saving
and
it
was
this
small
income
that
has
been
and
is
in
a
commercial
sense
the
ruin
of
my
life
it
was
now
the
end
of
october
and
i
was
in
chicago
squandering
a
summer
earnings
having
during
the
previous
months
worked
on
a
fruit
farm
in
illinois
i
had
been
idling
for
three
weeks
visiting
the
various
theatres
at
night
and
reading
during
the
day
one
sunday
i
had
bought
a
weekly
paper
wherein
i
read
an
appreciation
of
the
poet
burns
with
numerous
quotations
from
his
work
my
thoughts
wandered
back
to
the
past
the
ambition
of
my
early
days
and
the
encouraging
words
of
my
elders
ah
i
said
with
a
sigh
if
during
these
five
years
i
had
had
the
daily
companionship
of
good
books
instead
of
all
this
restless
wandering
to
and
fro
in
a
strange
land
my
mind
at
the
present
hour
might
be
capable
of
some
little
achievement
of
its
own
these
thoughts
haunted
me
all
day
and
that
night
a
great
joy
came
over
me
for
after
my
thoughts
had
tugged
and
pulled
at
my
heart
all
pointing
in
the
one
direction
which
i
saw
was
towards
england
i
settled
with
myself
to
follow
them
to
that
place
so
that
night
i
resolved
to
leave
chicago
early
the
following
day
beat
my
way
to
baltimore
work
a
cattle
boat
to
either
liverpool
or
london
and
from
one
of
these
places
make
my
way
back
to
where
i
belonged
with
this
object
i
was
up
early
the
next
morning
had
breakfast
and
in
as
happy
a
mood
as
when
i
first
landed
in
america
left
chicago
for
the
last
time
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
was
an
easy
road
to
beat
i
had
taken
with
me
a
good
lunch
with
a
small
flask
of
whisky
so
that
i
might
attend
to
travelling
for
twenty
or
thirty
hours
without
suffering
thirst
or
hunger
at
the
end
of
hours
i
got
off
a
train
now
being
hungry
and
thirsty
at
a
small
town
having
by
then
traversed
half
the
distance
between
chicago
and
baltimore
without
staying
any
length
of
time
in
pittsburg
i
caught
a
train
for
connesville
and
arriving
there
in
a
few
hours
had
to
dismount
and
wait
the
next
train
for
cumberland
in
the
state
of
maryland
a
train
was
now
being
made
up
consisting
of
flat
cars
loaded
with
iron
rails
and
coal
cars
also
loaded
there
was
not
much
necessity
on
this
road
of
concealing
oneself
so
i
boldly
mounted
a
coal
car
and
there
i
sat
exposed
to
the
elements
and
to
the
curious
gaze
of
people
at
the
various
small
towns
through
which
we
passed
what
surprised
me
not
a
little
was
that
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
man
that
was
beating
his
way
on
this
train
whereas
this
being
such
an
easy
road
most
trains
had
a
number
of
tramps
some
of
them
having
two
score
or
more
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
notice
that
these
people
at
the
different
stations
and
villages
stared
at
me
with
something
like
awe
had
pale
faces
pointed
at
me
in
an
unusual
manner
and
whispered
to
each
other
now
between
connesville
and
cumberland
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
crosses
the
allegheny
mountains
and
often
the
train
if
heavy
can
scarcely
crawl
up
after
which
it
runs
down
at
a
terrific
speed
we
had
just
mounted
a
steep
elevation
had
reached
the
top
and
the
train
men
were
making
fast
their
brakes
for
the
steep
incline
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
when
my
attention
was
drawn
to
a
large
number
of
people
assembled
in
the
valley
below
some
distance
ahead
i
then
saw
that
the
mountain
side
was
covered
with
coal
and
between
forty
and
fifty
trucks
lay
in
a
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
this
train
had
apparently
through
some
cause
or
another
jumped
the
rails
and
the
cars
had
rolled
over
and
over
from
top
to
bottom
when
i
reached
cumberland
still
being
stared
at
and
pointed
out
at
the
various
stations
and
villages
on
the
way
it
was
not
long
before
an
explanation
was
forthcoming
i
it
seemed
had
followed
a
train
that
had
killed
men
two
brakesmen
the
engineer
conductor
and
forty
tramps
who
were
beating
their
way
on
coming
down
the
mountain
side
the
brakes
had
refused
to
work
the
fireman
had
jumped
off
in
time
to
save
his
own
life
and
the
others
had
all
been
precipitated
with
the
train
into
the
valley
and
killed
it
had
run
with
such
a
reckless
speed
that
it
could
not
possibly
maintain
its
hold
of
the
rails
and
this
accounted
for
my
being
the
one
traveller
on
this
train
and
how
the
people
had
seemed
at
my
temerity
which
of
course
was
no
more
than
ignorance
of
the
mishap
after
this
ride
i
never
again
felt
comfortable
on
a
train
much
preferring
to
take
my
chance
on
the
water
however
stormy
it
might
be
it
made
me
pause
when
this
same
night
an
unknown
man
was
struck
down
by
a
fast
express
train
mangled
and
cut
into
pieces
two
or
three
trains
left
this
town
of
cumberland
before
i
could
summon
sufficient
courage
to
ride
i
was
standing
still
wondering
whether
i
should
ride
or
walk
from
this
town
to
baltimore
when
a
switchman
who
had
just
helped
finish
making
ready
a
train
said
hello
lad
which
way
are
you
going
to
baltimore
on
answering
in
the
affirmative
he
said
pointing
to
this
train
jump
on
you
will
be
there
early
in
the
morning
which
i
did
at
the
same
time
saying
to
myself
this
is
my
last
train
ride
in
america
whether
i
live
or
die
no
sleep
that
night
and
i
was
not
sorry
to
reach
baltimore
i
had
something
like
fifty
dollars
at
this
time
and
intended
to
go
at
once
to
the
cattleman
office
and
to
ship
at
the
first
opportunity
so
that
i
might
still
have
a
few
pounds
left
when
i
landed
in
england
so
when
i
reached
baltimore
i
soon
made
my
way
to
that
place
and
on
entering
recognised
several
of
the
old
cattlemen
among
whom
was
no
less
a
person
than
australian
red
who
it
seemed
had
lost
all
ambition
for
a
more
respectable
life
i
invited
him
out
with
two
others
and
we
had
several
drinks
and
at
night
visited
the
theatre
now
i
said
after
leaving
the
theatre
well
knowing
that
these
men
would
unscrupulously
bleed
me
to
the
last
cent
and
would
take
a
cunning
delight
in
robbing
me
and
bearing
all
expenses
themselves
now
i
said
one
drink
more
and
we
have
reached
the
end
of
my
resources
shipping
red
explained
to
me
on
the
following
day
was
rather
slow
for
experienced
hands
he
had
been
begging
baltimore
for
more
than
six
weeks
and
was
still
without
prospect
of
making
a
trip
he
explained
that
he
could
go
at
any
time
for
a
pound
and
had
had
a
chance
or
two
to
go
for
thirty
shillings
but
very
few
men
had
been
called
for
during
the
last
three
months
are
you
going
out
for
breakfast
he
asked
if
you
have
any
more
money
left
do
be
foolish
enough
to
spend
it
on
food
for
i
can
get
you
more
than
you
want
of
that
and
the
money
can
be
used
for
pleasure
you
already
know
that
i
have
no
more
money
i
said
to
him
feeling
myself
change
colour
with
guilt
which
he
did
not
notice
wait
here
till
i
return
he
said
if
you
do
feel
inclined
to
beg
for
a
day
or
two
you
need
have
no
fear
of
starving
he
then
left
me
and
after
he
had
gone
i
followed
and
feeling
guilty
and
ashamed
turned
into
a
restaurant
for
breakfast
later
on
when
i
returned
to
the
office
red
was
waiting
for
me
with
an
abundance
of
food
for
he
had
made
extra
exertion
on
this
particular
morning
come
he
said
you
must
be
hungry
by
this
time
knowing
that
i
had
this
part
to
keep
up
i
sat
down
but
after
slowly
eating
a
morsel
or
two
which
had
been
difficult
to
swallow
i
found
it
necessary
to
plead
a
full
stomach
red
was
persistent
and
so
dissatisfied
at
this
that
i
could
not
help
but
feel
grateful
for
such
kindness
and
feeling
more
shame
than
ever
at
playing
such
a
part
i
arose
telling
him
i
would
wait
for
him
outside
the
office
he
soon
followed
and
leading
the
way
to
another
part
of
the
city
i
commenced
with
him
a
spree
that
ended
in
a
week
debauchery
both
of
us
then
being
penniless
we
returned
to
the
cattleman
office
to
find
that
a
good
chance
had
been
lost
in
our
absence
when
the
shipper
had
enquired
for
us
what
cried
red
go
home
for
good
next
trip
eh
why
you
are
cursed
like
myself
by
restlessness
and
mark
me
you
will
not
remain
six
months
in
your
native
town
perhaps
not
i
said
but
i
assure
you
that
neither
this
town
nor
this
country
shall
again
feel
my
tread
some
days
after
this
i
was
sent
with
several
others
to
rope
cattle
at
the
yards
and
there
met
a
foreman
under
whom
i
had
made
a
former
trip
hallo
said
he
i
have
not
seen
you
for
some
time
are
you
going
with
this
lot
of
cattle
i
do
know
was
my
answer
but
i
should
certainly
like
to
if
there
is
need
of
a
man
well
he
said
i
put
in
a
good
word
for
you
at
the
office
that
night
the
shipping
master
approached
me
on
the
subject
look
here
he
said
i
can
only
give
you
thirty
shillings
for
this
trip
if
you
like
to
wait
you
can
have
two
pounds
but
i
warn
you
the
chance
may
be
a
long
time
coming
what
do
you
say
i
sign
for
thirty
shillings
i
said
with
difficulty
trying
to
conceal
my
eagerness
which
was
at
once
done
i
was
alone
on
this
trip
among
strangers
had
australian
red
accompanied
me
no
doubt
i
should
have
spent
my
train
fare
and
been
forced
to
return
to
america
on
the
same
boat
what
an
enjoyable
trip
this
was
from
beginning
to
end
what
music
heard
in
the
weighing
of
the
anchor
and
what
a
delightful
sensation
when
the
good
ship
moved
slowly
from
her
dock
i
performed
my
duty
with
a
new
pleasure
leaping
here
and
there
at
any
sign
of
danger
giving
one
steer
longer
or
shorter
rope
as
the
case
required
knowing
what
pleasant
dreams
would
be
mine
at
night
when
the
day
work
was
done
and
when
this
pleasant
time
came
i
would
lie
in
my
bunk
and
take
an
inventory
of
all
the
old
familiar
things
which
had
been
stored
in
my
memory
unthought
of
for
over
five
years
and
nothing
would
now
escape
me
i
had
written
home
only
three
times
during
this
long
absence
three
short
letters
in
my
first
year
abroad
probably
they
had
given
me
up
for
dead
and
i
would
appear
at
their
door
as
a
visitant
from
another
world
one
thought
often
troubled
me
and
that
was
to
be
going
home
without
money
after
such
a
long
stay
in
a
new
country
for
every
man
thinks
that
fortunes
are
more
easily
made
in
other
lands
than
his
own
and
i
knew
that
people
would
expect
me
to
be
in
possession
of
ranches
flourishing
towns
and
gold
mines
and
i
felt
much
shame
in
having
to
admit
that
i
had
returned
poorer
than
ever
had
it
not
been
for
the
money
saved
during
my
absence
which
had
not
been
convenient
for
use
this
thought
had
been
likely
to
prevent
my
return
for
some
years
longer
perhaps
for
my
whole
life
on
the
tenth
day
we
were
passing
ireland
on
which
i
gazed
with
deep
feeling
taking
her
to
my
heart
as
a
sister
isle
knowing
at
the
same
time
that
her
heart
was
her
distressful
own
when
i
reached
liverpool
and
the
cattle
had
gone
ashore
i
received
my
pay
and
slipping
away
from
the
other
cattlemen
went
alone
up
town
made
a
few
purchases
in
the
way
of
clothes
and
arrived
at
the
railway
station
with
three
shillings
and
a
few
coppers
over
my
fare
with
this
insignificant
amount
the
result
of
five
years
in
a
rich
country
and
something
like
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
standing
to
my
account
i
arrived
that
evening
at
my
native
town
here
i
wandered
lost
for
several
hours
making
enquiries
for
my
people
who
during
my
stay
abroad
had
moved
from
the
place
i
knew
i
had
just
made
up
my
mind
to
seek
a
favourite
aunt
of
mine
who
previous
to
my
leaving
england
had
been
a
number
of
years
in
one
house
and
did
not
then
seem
likely
to
leave
when
a
strange
woman
in
the
street
where
i
was
making
enquiries
recognised
me
by
my
likeness
to
mother
and
at
once
directed
me
to
her
place
i
knocked
on
the
door
and
mother
who
always
was
and
is
full
of
premonitions
and
is
very
superstitious
in
the
way
of
signs
and
dreams
opened
the
door
at
once
knew
who
i
was
in
the
dark
though
we
could
not
see
much
of
each
other
form
or
face
and
to
my
surprise
called
me
by
name
me
mother
i
said
yes
she
answered
i
thought
it
was
your
knock
just
as
though
i
had
only
been
out
for
an
evening
stroll
she
said
in
the
course
of
the
evening
that
they
had
all
given
me
up
for
dead
except
herself
and
that
she
had
also
three
years
before
given
up
all
hopes
of
seeing
me
again
having
had
a
dream
wherein
she
saw
me
beat
about
the
head
and
lying
bloody
at
the
feet
of
strangers
she
mentioned
the
year
and
even
the
month
of
this
year
and
a
little
consideration
on
my
part
placed
its
date
with
that
of
the
outrage
at
new
orleans
but
i
did
not
then
trouble
her
with
an
account
of
this
when
i
was
very
small
an
aunt
took
me
to
live
with
her
for
a
couple
or
more
months
in
a
small
town
in
gloucestershire
a
county
in
which
mother
had
never
been
but
she
had
a
dream
in
which
she
saw
me
leaving
the
house
with
my
uncle
dinner
and
that
i
had
to
follow
the
canal
bank
to
his
works
she
saw
me
returning
that
same
way
and
beginning
to
play
near
the
water
fall
in
head
first
she
in
her
dream
just
reaching
the
spot
in
time
to
save
me
early
the
following
morning
after
this
dream
mother
came
by
train
to
this
village
walked
the
canal
bank
to
my
aunt
house
without
enquiring
its
whereabouts
and
demanded
her
son
before
he
was
drowned
there
was
certainly
a
possibility
of
this
happening
for
i
was
very
small
at
that
time
and
the
canal
was
deep
she
had
never
before
been
in
this
place
but
the
locality
seemed
to
be
to
her
as
it
was
seen
in
her
sleep
chapter
xviii
off
again
of
course
at
this
homecoming
i
vowed
that
i
would
never
again
leave
my
native
town
true
i
found
great
difficulty
in
sleeping
on
a
soft
bed
and
lay
awake
several
hours
through
the
night
tossing
and
turning
from
one
side
to
another
the
food
itself
did
not
seem
so
palatable
coming
out
of
clean
pots
and
shining
ovens
as
that
which
was
cooked
in
close
contact
with
the
embers
and
in
the
smoke
and
blaze
of
a
camp
fire
the
unplucked
chicken
covered
with
a
thick
crust
of
mud
and
baked
under
a
pile
of
hot
ashes
after
which
the
hard
crust
could
be
broken
to
show
the
chicken
inside
as
clean
as
a
new
born
babe
with
all
its
feathers
and
down
stuck
hard
in
the
mud
this
meat
to
me
was
far
more
tasty
than
that
one
at
home
that
was
plucked
and
gutted
with
care
and
roasted
or
baked
to
a
supposed
nicety
this
food
of
civilisation
certainly
seemed
to
suffer
from
a
lack
of
good
wholesome
dirt
and
i
should
like
to
have
had
my
own
wood
fire
at
the
end
of
the
backyard
were
it
not
for
shame
for
several
weeks
i
walked
the
streets
renewing
old
acquaintance
accosted
here
and
there
by
my
old
most
of
them
were
married
but
married
or
single
they
all
seemed
to
be
poor
and
unsuccessful
i
began
to
drink
immoderately
at
this
time
meeting
one
and
the
other
and
very
soon
began
to
realise
that
my
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
were
going
at
the
rate
of
a
sovereign
a
day
scarcely
had
i
been
home
one
month
when
to
escape
from
so
much
drink
i
made
a
trip
to
bordeaux
on
one
of
the
local
steamers
but
it
was
of
no
use
for
i
saw
the
time
coming
when
i
would
again
be
without
prospects
i
had
not
worked
at
my
trade
since
leaving
bristol
six
years
before
and
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
again
the
fever
of
restlessness
that
had
governed
me
in
the
past
broke
out
afresh
and
after
two
months
of
this
idle
life
i
suddenly
made
a
pretence
of
being
filled
with
a
desire
for
business
saying
it
was
my
intention
to
open
a
bookshop
in
london
and
as
soon
as
possible
which
i
have
often
had
thoughts
of
doing
with
this
end
in
view
i
drew
the
remainder
of
my
money
which
in
two
months
had
dwindled
by
a
half
divided
a
few
pounds
among
the
family
and
took
train
for
london
yes
i
repeated
to
myself
several
times
on
this
journey
i
will
open
a
bookshop
and
settle
down
to
a
quiet
life
of
study
for
which
there
will
be
ample
time
during
the
intervals
of
business
in
london
i
saw
a
number
of
vacant
shops
that
would
have
answered
the
purpose
but
unfortunately
i
had
not
the
least
notion
of
how
or
where
to
obtain
books
the
greater
part
of
which
were
to
be
if
when
on
this
quest
i
could
have
bought
a
bookshop
ready
fitted
and
filled
no
doubt
i
would
have
closed
with
the
offer
at
once
and
settled
quietly
down
not
seeing
any
way
out
of
this
difficulty
i
continued
my
rambles
through
the
city
day
after
day
invariably
visiting
the
theatre
at
night
this
happened
for
over
a
week
and
the
money
was
still
going
out
and
none
coming
in
and
poverty
never
appeared
worse
to
me
than
at
that
time
one
afternoon
when
passing
through
trafalgar
square
i
bought
an
early
edition
of
an
evening
paper
and
the
first
paragraph
that
met
my
eye
had
this
very
attractive
heading
a
land
of
gold
it
was
a
description
of
the
klondyke
and
a
glowing
account
of
the
many
good
fortunes
that
daily
fell
to
the
lot
of
hardy
adventurers
it
would
cost
me
sixty
pounds
or
more
to
travel
to
that
remote
part
of
the
world
and
pounds
were
all
i
now
possessed
this
thought
did
not
for
long
discourage
me
from
making
the
attempt
i
knew
that
i
could
beat
my
way
across
the
canadian
continent
without
using
a
cent
for
travelling
and
i
could
save
these
few
pounds
for
food
and
cases
in
which
payment
would
be
absolutely
necessary
when
forced
to
travel
on
foot
at
the
other
end
of
canada
that
night
i
exchanged
thirty
pounds
for
their
equivalent
in
paper
dollars
placing
the
latter
in
a
belt
which
i
wore
next
to
my
skin
determined
that
this
money
should
not
see
the
light
until
my
journey
was
nearly
done
it
was
now
the
month
of
march
and
the
navigation
of
the
lawrence
had
not
yet
opened
so
that
i
would
be
compelled
to
beat
my
way
from
halifax
or
john
to
montreal
which
would
not
be
necessary
later
in
the
spring
when
the
latter
port
would
be
the
destination
of
all
emigrant
ships
i
was
very
happy
at
this
time
with
these
prospects
in
view
which
were
really
too
bright
to
decoy
any
man
who
had
an
average
amount
of
my
conception
of
that
wonderful
land
for
all
my
travels
was
childish
in
the
extreme
i
thought
the
rocks
were
of
solid
gold
which
so
dazzled
the
sun
that
he
could
not
concentrate
his
glance
on
any
particular
part
and
that
his
eye
went
swimming
all
day
in
a
haze
i
pictured
men
in
possession
of
caves
sitting
helpless
in
the
midst
of
accumulated
nuggets
puzzled
as
to
how
to
convey
all
this
wealth
to
the
marts
of
civilisation
what
i
wanted
with
all
these
riches
i
can
not
say
for
it
was
never
a
desire
of
mine
to
possess
jewellery
fine
raiment
yachts
castles
or
horses
all
i
desired
was
a
small
house
of
my
own
and
leisure
for
study
in
fact
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
waste
time
in
hoarding
more
wealth
than
would
be
necessary
to
these
small
comforts
but
to
return
home
satisfied
with
a
sum
not
exceeding
two
thousand
pounds
the
interest
from
which
would
i
thought
be
ample
for
any
student
who
remained
true
to
his
aims
and
was
sincere
in
his
love
for
literature
in
this
month
of
march
the
first
day
in
the
second
week
i
left
euston
station
at
midnight
and
arrived
cold
and
shaking
in
liverpool
early
the
next
morning
on
making
enquiries
i
learnt
that
a
ship
was
leaving
for
john
on
the
following
wednesday
from
which
place
emigrants
must
needs
go
by
train
to
quebec
or
montreal
owing
to
the
condition
of
the
river
i
decided
on
making
john
my
destination
from
which
port
i
would
beat
my
way
towards
the
west
going
easy
at
first
and
faster
as
the
spring
of
the
year
advanced
the
accommodation
for
steerage
passengers
on
this
ship
was
abominable
and
their
comfort
seemed
to
be
not
in
the
least
considered
this
was
owing
to
the
small
number
of
english
speaking
people
that
were
travelling
as
steerage
passengers
and
the
disgusting
filthy
habits
of
the
great
majority
who
were
a
low
class
of
jews
and
peasantry
from
the
interior
of
russia
none
of
the
ship
crews
could
be
expected
to
treat
these
people
as
one
of
themselves
seeing
them
sit
to
eat
in
the
filth
of
their
skin
and
fur
clothes
without
the
least
thought
of
washing
and
again
hiding
food
in
their
bed
clothes
making
the
cabin
too
foul
to
sleep
in
after
seeing
the
first
meal
fought
for
and
scrambled
for
on
the
steerage
floor
where
it
had
fallen
we
englishmen
five
in
number
took
possession
of
a
small
table
to
ourselves
only
allowing
one
other
a
frenchman
to
sit
with
us
this
did
not
succeed
without
some
protest
on
the
second
day
out
when
we
went
below
for
our
meal
we
found
the
table
to
be
already
occupied
by
these
people
who
maintained
our
seats
looking
defiantly
at
us
to
show
that
they
had
taken
no
accidental
possession
of
the
same
it
was
owing
to
these
defiant
looks
that
we
determined
to
this
table
stick
close
together
said
a
young
englishman
who
was
a
blacksmith
with
the
accredited
brawny
arms
saying
which
he
caught
one
of
the
usurpers
in
his
arms
and
with
great
force
threw
him
in
the
midst
of
his
people
knocking
several
of
them
down
there
was
great
commotion
at
this
two
hundred
of
these
haters
of
soap
and
water
began
to
jabber
and
wildly
gesticulate
and
no
doubt
every
foul
word
in
that
unknown
tongue
was
used
against
us
instead
of
seating
ourselves
at
once
at
the
table
which
was
now
unoccupied
we
stood
in
our
small
body
waiting
with
a
quiet
determination
which
did
not
seem
at
all
to
their
relish
this
attitude
conquered
them
and
as
none
of
us
were
quarrelsome
and
did
not
again
in
any
way
interfere
with
them
either
on
deck
or
below
the
trip
was
ended
without
any
further
trouble
so
many
of
these
aliens
were
landing
in
canada
at
this
time
that
when
i
approached
the
custom
house
officers
one
of
them
judging
by
my
features
and
complexion
which
were
not
much
unlike
those
of
a
native
of
the
south
addressed
me
in
an
unknown
tongue
i
looked
at
him
in
surprise
which
made
him
repeat
his
question
probably
in
another
tongue
equally
unknown
being
rather
incensed
at
this
and
flushing
indignantly
at
this
tone
to
a
dog
i
lost
no
time
in
answering
him
according
to
billingsgate
ho
ho
he
laughed
so
you
are
a
blooming
cockney
and
so
am
i
why
did
you
say
so
at
once
the
blacksmith
had
booked
through
to
quebec
and
would
take
train
to
that
place
before
morning
three
other
englishmen
had
booked
through
to
winnipeg
and
would
travel
with
him
by
the
same
train
the
other
englishman
a
carpenter
by
trade
had
relatives
in
montreal
and
having
only
a
couple
of
dollars
in
his
possession
was
willing
to
take
instructions
from
me
how
to
get
there
i
promised
to
get
this
man
to
montreal
in
three
or
four
days
providing
he
did
not
at
any
time
question
my
actions
he
kept
his
promise
and
i
kept
mine
for
on
the
fourth
day
after
landing
i
wished
him
outside
his
house
which
he
had
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
i
was
now
alone
and
seeking
a
companion
for
my
journey
west
now
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
man
known
by
the
name
of
joe
beef
who
kept
a
saloon
in
montreal
supplying
his
customers
with
a
good
free
lunch
all
day
and
a
hot
beef
stew
being
the
midday
dish
there
was
not
a
tramp
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
north
american
continent
who
had
not
heard
of
this
and
a
goodly
number
had
at
one
time
or
another
patronised
his
establishment
often
had
i
heard
of
this
famous
hostelry
for
the
poor
and
needy
and
the
flavour
of
its
stew
discussed
by
old
travellers
in
the
far
states
of
the
south
when
i
thought
of
this
i
knew
that
a
companion
for
any
part
of
america
could
most
certainly
be
found
on
this
man
premises
and
i
would
there
hear
much
valuable
information
as
to
the
road
i
was
about
to
travel
so
i
went
strolling
along
quietly
intending
to
wait
until
i
met
some
needy
looking
individual
before
i
made
enquiries
now
whenever
joe
beef
name
had
been
mentioned
it
had
invariably
led
to
the
mention
of
french
marie
and
the
name
of
the
latter
as
invariably
introduced
the
name
of
joe
beef
for
these
two
establishments
seemed
to
be
patronised
by
the
same
class
these
names
were
to
me
for
as
i
have
said
their
fame
was
abroad
throughout
america
i
was
strolling
along
with
these
thoughts
when
i
met
the
man
of
my
desire
leaning
lazily
against
a
post
not
wishing
to
accost
him
outright
and
yet
eager
for
his
conversation
i
stood
beside
him
lighting
my
pipe
striking
several
matches
for
this
purpose
and
failing
owing
to
the
wind
blowing
in
small
gusts
seeing
my
dilemma
the
man
quickly
produced
matches
of
his
own
and
striking
one
held
it
lighted
between
the
palms
of
his
hands
leaving
just
enough
space
for
the
bowl
of
my
pipe
to
enter
for
this
i
thanked
him
and
secondly
invited
him
to
a
drink
asking
him
where
we
should
go
being
in
hopes
he
would
mention
joe
beef
well
he
answered
pointing
to
the
opposite
corner
the
nearest
place
is
french
marie
we
entered
that
place
and
in
the
course
of
conversation
i
told
him
how
i
had
beat
my
way
from
state
to
state
but
that
this
was
my
first
experience
in
canada
the
united
states
said
this
man
sagely
are
nearly
played
out
and
of
late
years
there
are
far
too
many
travellers
there
you
will
find
the
canadian
roads
better
to
beat
and
the
hearts
easier
to
impress
for
they
are
not
overrun
when
did
you
get
here
knowing
that
this
man
was
under
the
impression
that
i
had
just
beat
my
way
into
canada
from
the
states
and
not
willing
to
undeceive
him
i
answered
quickly
this
morning
and
for
a
time
changed
the
conversation
into
a
praise
of
the
beer
where
are
you
going
to
sleep
he
asked
meet
me
here
in
half
an
hour
after
i
have
begged
the
price
of
my
bed
and
a
drink
or
two
and
we
will
both
go
to
joe
beef
where
i
have
been
for
this
last
week
not
wishing
to
lose
sight
of
this
man
i
told
him
that
my
pocket
could
maintain
the
two
of
us
until
the
next
day
all
right
said
he
appearing
much
relieved
we
will
go
at
once
and
settle
for
our
beds
and
come
out
for
an
hour
or
so
this
evening
leaving
french
marie
we
walked
beside
the
river
for
some
distance
when
my
companion
halted
before
a
building
which
i
knew
must
be
joe
beef
having
just
seen
two
seedy
looking
travellers
entering
we
followed
and
to
my
surprise
i
saw
it
was
a
rather
clean
looking
restaurant
with
several
long
tables
with
seats
and
a
long
bar
on
which
the
food
was
served
but
what
surprised
me
most
was
to
see
a
number
of
salvation
army
men
and
officers
in
charge
of
this
place
without
saying
a
word
to
my
companion
i
took
a
seat
at
one
of
the
tables
to
order
a
beef
stew
asking
him
what
he
would
have
and
for
his
sake
the
order
was
doubled
when
joe
beef
kept
this
place
whispered
my
companion
he
was
a
true
friend
to
travellers
but
you
do
get
much
out
of
these
people
except
you
pay
for
it
although
i
winked
at
him
as
though
the
same
thoughts
were
mine
i
noticed
that
the
meals
were
well
worth
what
was
charged
for
them
and
in
after
days
i
often
compared
this
place
favourably
with
similar
institutions
in
london
that
were
under
the
same
management
and
where
men
did
not
get
the
worth
of
their
money
chapter
xix
a
voice
in
the
dark
at
this
place
i
remained
several
weeks
watching
the
smiling
spring
which
had
already
taken
possession
of
the
air
and
made
the
skies
blue
unloosing
the
icy
fingers
of
winter
which
still
held
the
earth
down
under
a
thick
cover
of
snow
what
a
glorious
time
of
the
year
is
this
with
the
warm
sun
travelling
through
serene
skies
the
air
clear
and
fresh
above
you
which
instils
new
blood
in
the
body
making
one
defiantly
tramp
the
earth
kicking
the
snows
aside
in
the
scorn
of
action
the
cheeks
glow
with
health
the
lips
smile
and
there
is
no
careworn
face
seen
save
they
come
out
of
the
house
of
sickness
of
death
and
that
lean
spectre
called
hunger
has
never
been
known
to
appear
in
these
parts
if
it
was
for
one
moment
supposed
that
such
a
spectre
possessed
a
house
in
this
country
kind
hearts
would
at
once
storm
the
place
with
such
an
abundance
of
good
things
that
the
spectre
victim
would
need
to
exert
great
care
and
power
of
will
if
he
would
not
succumb
to
an
overloaded
stomach
this
spectre
is
often
seen
in
the
overcrowded
cities
of
europe
and
one
of
its
favourite
haunts
is
the
thames
embankment
in
front
of
the
fine
hotels
where
ambassadors
and
millionaires
dine
sumptuously
where
they
sit
or
stand
at
their
windows
watching
the
many
lights
of
the
city
and
to
see
the
moon
dipping
her
silver
pitcher
in
the
dark
river
and
they
swear
by
jove
it
is
worth
seeing
but
they
can
not
see
this
spectre
of
hunger
moving
slowly
and
sometimes
painfully
from
shadow
to
shadow
shivering
and
anxious
for
the
sun
for
they
have
no
other
fire
to
sit
before
to
make
their
dreams
of
the
past
pleasant
i
remained
three
weeks
in
this
inexpensive
hotel
and
decided
to
travel
on
the
following
monday
although
the
snow
was
still
deep
in
montreal
and
would
be
yet
deeper
in
the
country
i
had
a
small
room
for
sleeping
purposes
at
a
cost
of
fifteen
cents
per
night
there
were
several
others
of
the
same
kind
each
divided
one
from
the
other
by
a
thin
wooden
partition
which
was
high
enough
for
privacy
but
did
not
prevent
curious
lodgers
from
standing
tip
toe
on
their
beds
and
peering
into
another
room
going
to
bed
early
on
sunday
night
previous
to
continuing
my
journey
on
the
following
day
i
was
somewhat
startled
on
entering
my
room
to
hear
a
gentle
rap
on
the
partition
which
divided
my
room
from
the
next
hallo
i
cried
what
do
you
want
the
man
wants
it
seemed
were
private
for
he
seemed
frightened
into
silence
at
this
loud
tone
of
demand
which
would
most
certainly
draw
the
attention
of
others
at
last
he
cleared
his
throat
by
a
forced
fit
of
coughing
and
then
whispered
in
a
low
distinct
voice
i
want
a
match
if
you
can
oblige
me
with
one
of
course
smoking
was
not
allowed
in
the
but
in
this
respect
we
were
nearly
all
breakers
of
the
law
taking
a
few
matches
from
my
pocket
i
threw
them
over
the
partition
and
heard
him
feeling
in
the
after
hearing
the
sound
of
them
falling
then
he
gently
struck
one
and
by
its
light
gathered
in
the
others
in
a
moment
or
two
he
addressed
me
in
his
natural
voice
and
to
my
surprise
it
sounded
familiar
and
filled
me
with
curiosity
to
see
this
man
face
i
encouraged
him
to
talk
which
he
seemed
determined
to
do
thinking
a
word
might
reveal
him
to
me
and
the
circumstances
under
which
we
had
met
his
voice
in
the
dark
puzzled
me
and
i
could
not
for
my
life
locate
it
a
hundred
scenes
passed
through
my
memory
some
of
them
containing
a
number
of
characters
in
my
fancy
i
made
them
all
speak
to
me
before
dismissing
them
again
to
the
dim
regions
from
which
they
had
been
summoned
but
not
one
of
their
voices
corresponded
with
this
voice
heard
in
the
dark
above
this
voice
i
placed
thin
and
thick
moustaches
black
grey
brown
red
and
white
under
this
voice
i
put
heavy
and
light
beards
of
various
hues
and
still
out
of
all
my
material
failed
to
make
a
familiar
face
still
sending
memory
forth
in
quest
of
the
owner
of
this
voice
and
she
poor
thing
bringing
forward
smiling
men
and
stern
men
thin
men
and
fat
men
short
men
and
tall
men
tame
men
and
wild
men
hairy
men
and
bald
men
dark
men
and
fair
men
until
she
became
so
confused
as
to
bring
back
the
same
people
the
second
time
still
sending
her
forth
on
this
vain
quest
i
fell
asleep
it
was
a
dreamless
sleep
no
sound
broke
its
stillness
and
no
face
looked
into
its
depths
and
when
i
awoke
the
next
morning
this
voice
seemed
to
be
already
in
possession
of
my
thoughts
i
lay
awake
for
about
ten
minutes
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
rising
thinking
the
man
had
left
his
chamber
when
i
heard
a
stir
coming
from
that
direction
he
was
now
dressing
following
his
example
but
with
more
haste
so
as
to
be
the
first
ready
i
waited
the
unbolting
of
his
door
so
that
i
might
meet
this
man
face
to
face
i
unbolted
my
own
door
and
opened
it
when
i
was
but
half
dressed
but
there
was
no
necessity
for
doing
this
for
my
arms
were
in
the
sleeves
of
my
coat
when
his
bolt
was
slipped
back
and
we
simultaneously
appeared
at
the
same
time
wishing
each
other
good
morning
i
recognised
this
man
without
difficulty
but
apparently
had
the
advantage
of
him
to
make
no
mistake
i
looked
at
his
right
hand
and
saw
the
two
fingers
missing
knowing
him
for
a
certainty
to
be
three
fingered
jack
who
had
been
a
cattleman
from
montreal
whom
i
had
met
in
glasgow
when
i
had
gone
there
from
baltimore
three
years
previous
to
this
on
that
occasion
i
had
been
in
this
man
company
for
only
half
an
hour
and
since
that
time
had
heard
thousands
of
voices
but
was
still
positive
that
i
had
heard
this
voice
before
we
stood
side
by
side
washing
and
preparing
for
breakfast
and
although
i
remained
a
stranger
to
him
as
far
as
former
acquaintance
was
concerned
i
mentioned
to
him
in
confidence
that
i
was
going
west
that
very
morning
after
breakfast
so
was
i
he
said
as
far
as
winnipeg
but
thought
to
wait
until
some
of
this
snow
cleared
anyhow
as
a
day
or
two
makes
little
difference
we
will
if
you
are
agreeable
start
together
this
morning
i
know
the
country
well
he
continued
between
montreal
and
winnipeg
having
travelled
it
a
number
of
times
and
i
promise
you
nothing
shall
be
wanting
on
the
way
this
man
had
lost
his
two
fingers
at
work
in
the
cotton
mills
some
ten
years
before
and
ever
since
then
had
been
living
in
idleness
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
trips
he
had
made
as
a
cattleman
certainly
he
lived
well
on
the
kindness
of
these
people
as
any
able
bodied
man
might
do
in
this
country
without
being
in
any
way
afflicted
though
he
was
going
to
winnipeg
he
was
in
no
hurry
had
no
object
in
view
and
had
not
the
least
idea
of
where
that
town
would
lead
him
and
he
soon
tired
of
one
place
three
fingered
jack
was
a
slow
traveller
for
as
he
with
some
emotion
said
it
broke
his
heart
to
hurry
and
pass
through
good
towns
whose
inhabitants
were
all
the
happier
for
being
called
on
by
needy
men
this
slow
travelling
suited
me
for
the
time
being
for
we
were
having
another
fall
of
snow
and
i
half
regretted
having
left
montreal
although
day
after
day
i
was
certainly
getting
a
little
nearer
to
the
gold
of
klondyke
but
i
determined
to
shake
off
this
slow
companion
on
the
first
approach
of
fine
weather
we
loafed
all
day
in
the
different
railway
stations
in
each
of
which
was
kept
a
warm
comfortable
room
for
the
convenience
of
passengers
although
we
were
passengers
of
another
sort
and
stole
rides
on
the
trains
without
a
fraction
of
payment
to
the
company
we
boldly
made
ourselves
at
home
in
these
places
being
mistaken
for
respectable
travellers
who
were
enjoying
the
comforts
for
which
we
paid
sometimes
a
station
master
would
look
hard
on
us
suspecting
us
for
what
we
were
but
he
was
very
diffident
about
risking
a
question
however
much
he
was
displeased
at
seeing
us
in
comfortable
possession
of
the
seats
nearest
to
the
stoves
towards
evening
we
made
application
for
lodgings
at
the
local
jail
at
which
place
we
would
be
accommodated
until
the
following
morning
i
was
now
without
money
with
the
exception
of
that
which
was
concealed
and
reserved
for
the
most
hazardous
part
of
the
journey
which
would
be
its
western
end
now
in
all
these
jails
we
were
searched
and
examined
before
being
admitted
for
a
night
shelter
but
often
in
a
very
indifferent
manner
one
night
we
arrived
at
a
small
town
where
a
double
hanging
was
to
take
place
in
the
yard
of
the
jail
early
the
next
morning
a
woman
it
seems
had
called
on
her
lover
to
assist
in
the
murder
of
her
husband
which
had
been
brutally
done
with
an
axe
for
which
crime
both
had
been
pronounced
guilty
and
condemned
to
die
thousands
of
people
had
flocked
in
from
the
neighbouring
country
which
in
this
province
of
ontario
was
thickly
settled
and
a
large
number
of
plain
clothes
detectives
had
been
dispatched
from
the
cities
there
being
supposed
some
attempt
might
be
made
at
rescue
owing
to
one
of
the
condemned
being
a
woman
we
arrived
at
this
town
early
in
the
afternoon
and
were
surprised
at
the
unusual
bustle
and
the
many
groups
of
people
assembled
in
the
main
thoroughfares
thinking
the
town
contained
or
expected
some
attraction
in
the
way
of
a
circus
or
menagerie
we
expressed
little
curiosity
but
returned
at
once
to
the
railway
station
intending
to
possess
its
most
comfortable
seats
against
all
comers
until
the
approach
of
darkness
when
we
would
then
make
application
at
the
jail
for
our
night
accommodation
when
this
time
came
we
marched
straight
to
the
jail
and
boldly
hammered
its
door
for
admittance
it
was
at
once
answered
by
a
police
officer
to
whom
we
explained
our
wants
and
he
without
much
ado
invited
us
indoors
expecting
the
usual
questions
and
being
prepared
with
the
usual
answers
expecting
the
usual
indifferent
search
and
having
pipe
tobacco
and
matches
artfully
concealed
in
our
stockings
we
were
somewhat
taken
by
surprise
to
find
a
large
number
of
officers
who
all
seemed
to
show
an
uncommon
interest
in
our
appearance
the
officer
who
was
examining
us
previous
to
making
us
comfortable
for
the
night
had
finished
this
part
of
the
business
to
his
own
satisfaction
when
one
of
these
detectives
stepped
forward
and
said
we
can
not
admit
strangers
to
the
jail
on
the
present
occasion
so
that
you
had
better
make
them
out
an
order
for
the
hotel
this
order
was
then
given
to
us
and
we
immediately
left
the
jail
and
it
was
then
curious
to
know
the
reason
for
this
action
that
we
soon
made
ourselves
acquainted
with
the
true
facts
of
the
case
when
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
we
were
informed
that
every
bed
had
been
taken
since
morning
and
that
as
it
was
a
number
of
men
would
be
compelled
to
sit
all
night
dozing
in
their
chairs
and
it
was
with
this
information
that
we
returned
to
the
jail
for
the
second
time
we
were
admitted
and
were
advised
to
walk
to
the
next
town
this
three
fingered
jack
absolutely
refused
to
do
saying
that
his
feet
were
too
blistered
and
sore
to
carry
him
another
hundred
yards
all
these
detectives
then
got
together
and
after
a
rather
lengthy
consultation
one
of
them
came
forward
and
after
plying
us
with
a
number
of
questions
proceeded
to
examine
our
clothes
and
that
so
thoroughly
that
i
feared
for
the
result
at
the
beginning
of
the
search
i
gave
him
my
razor
a
small
penknife
my
and
a
comb
but
he
was
not
satisfied
until
his
hands
were
down
in
my
stockings
and
bringing
up
first
my
pipe
then
my
tobacco
and
lastly
the
matches
what
worried
me
most
was
the
belt
next
to
my
body
which
contained
my
money
i
had
not
much
fear
of
three
fingered
jack
when
confronting
each
other
openly
though
he
was
a
tall
active
man
but
had
he
known
of
these
dollars
i
had
not
dared
in
his
presence
to
have
closed
my
eyes
believing
that
he
would
have
battered
out
my
brains
with
a
stone
wooden
stake
or
iron
bar
so
that
he
might
possess
himself
of
this
amount
this
detective
certainly
discovered
the
belt
and
felt
it
carefully
but
the
money
being
in
paper
and
no
coin
or
hard
substance
being
therein
he
apparently
was
none
the
wiser
for
its
contents
at
last
this
severe
examination
was
at
an
end
and
we
were
both
led
through
an
iron
corridor
and
placed
in
a
cell
the
door
of
which
was
carefully
locked
i
do
believe
we
slept
one
moment
during
that
night
but
what
we
were
overlooked
by
a
pair
or
several
pairs
of
shrewd
eyes
they
could
not
believe
but
that
we
were
other
to
what
we
pretended
and
had
come
there
with
designs
to
thwart
the
ends
of
justice
next
morning
our
things
were
returned
to
us
and
we
were
turned
adrift
at
a
cold
hour
that
was
far
earlier
than
on
ordinary
occasions
the
snow
was
still
deep
and
the
mornings
and
evenings
cold
when
a
week
after
this
we
reached
ottawa
this
slow
travelling
was
not
at
all
to
my
liking
and
i
often
persuaded
my
companion
to
make
more
haste
towards
winnipeg
this
he
agreed
to
do
so
the
next
morning
we
jumped
a
freight
train
determined
to
hold
it
for
the
whole
day
unfortunately
it
was
simply
a
local
train
and
being
very
slow
having
to
stop
on
the
way
at
every
insignificant
little
station
we
left
it
at
a
town
called
renfrew
intending
that
night
to
beat
a
fast
overland
passenger
train
which
would
convey
us
four
or
five
hundred
miles
before
daybreak
with
this
object
we
sat
in
the
station
until
evening
and
then
some
twenty
minutes
before
the
train
became
due
we
slipped
out
unobserved
and
took
possession
of
an
empty
car
stationary
some
distance
away
from
which
place
we
could
see
the
train
coming
and
yet
be
unseen
from
the
station
platform
this
train
would
soon
arrive
for
passengers
were
already
pacing
the
platform
the
luggage
was
placed
in
readiness
and
a
number
of
curious
people
having
nothing
else
to
do
had
assembled
here
to
see
the
coming
and
going
of
the
train
at
last
we
heard
its
whistle
and
looking
out
we
saw
the
headlight
in
the
distance
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
it
steamed
into
the
station
without
making
much
noise
for
the
rails
were
slippery
there
still
being
much
ice
and
snow
on
the
track
come
i
said
to
jack
there
is
no
time
to
lose
and
we
quickly
jumped
out
of
the
empty
car
this
fast
passenger
train
carried
a
blind
baggage
car
which
means
that
the
end
nearest
to
the
engine
was
blind
in
having
no
door
our
object
was
to
suddenly
appear
from
a
hiding
place
darkness
being
favourable
and
leap
on
the
step
of
this
car
and
from
that
place
to
the
platform
this
being
done
when
the
train
was
in
motion
knowing
that
the
conductor
who
was
always
on
the
watch
for
such
doings
rarely
stopped
the
train
to
put
men
off
even
when
sure
of
their
presence
if
he
saw
us
before
the
train
started
he
would
certainly
take
means
to
prevent
us
from
riding
when
we
had
once
taken
possession
of
this
car
no
man
could
approach
us
until
we
reached
the
next
stopping
place
which
would
probably
be
fifty
miles
or
much
more
at
that
place
we
would
dismount
conceal
ourselves
and
when
it
was
again
in
motion
make
another
leap
for
our
former
place
of
course
the
engineer
and
fireman
could
reach
us
but
these
men
were
always
indifferent
and
never
interfered
their
business
being
ahead
instead
of
behind
the
engine
the
train
whistled
almost
before
we
were
ready
and
pulled
slowly
out
of
the
station
i
allowed
my
companion
the
advantage
of
being
the
first
to
jump
owing
to
his
maimed
hand
the
train
was
now
going
faster
and
faster
and
we
were
forced
to
keep
pace
with
it
making
a
leap
he
caught
the
handle
bar
and
sprang
lightly
on
the
step
after
which
my
hand
quickly
took
possession
of
this
bar
and
i
ran
with
the
train
prepared
to
follow
his
example
to
my
surprise
instead
of
at
once
taking
his
place
on
the
platform
my
companion
stood
thoughtlessly
irresolute
on
the
step
leaving
me
no
room
to
make
the
attempt
but
i
still
held
to
the
bar
though
the
train
was
now
going
so
fast
that
i
found
great
difficulty
in
keeping
step
with
it
i
shouted
to
him
to
clear
the
step
this
he
proceeded
to
do
very
deliberately
i
thought
taking
a
firmer
grip
on
the
bar
i
jumped
but
it
was
too
late
for
the
train
was
now
going
at
a
rapid
rate
my
foot
came
short
of
the
step
and
i
fell
and
still
clinging
to
the
handle
bar
was
dragged
several
yards
before
i
relinquished
my
hold
and
there
i
lay
for
several
minutes
feeling
a
little
shaken
whilst
the
train
passed
swiftly
on
into
the
darkness
even
then
i
did
not
know
what
had
happened
for
i
attempted
to
stand
but
found
that
something
had
happened
to
prevent
me
from
doing
this
sitting
down
in
an
upright
position
i
then
began
to
examine
myself
and
now
found
that
the
right
foot
was
severed
from
the
ankle
this
discovery
did
not
shock
me
so
much
as
the
thoughts
which
quickly
followed
for
as
i
could
feel
no
pain
i
did
not
know
but
what
my
body
was
in
several
parts
and
i
was
not
satisfied
until
i
examined
every
portion
of
it
seeing
a
man
crossing
the
track
i
shouted
to
him
for
assistance
he
looked
in
one
direction
and
another
not
seeing
me
in
the
darkness
and
was
going
his
way
when
i
shouted
again
this
time
he
looked
full
my
way
but
instead
of
coming
nearer
he
made
one
bound
in
the
air
nearly
fell
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
was
off
like
the
shot
from
a
gun
this
man
was
sought
after
for
several
weeks
by
people
curious
to
know
who
he
was
but
was
never
found
and
no
man
came
forward
to
say
i
am
he
having
failed
to
find
this
man
people
at
last
began
to
think
i
was
under
a
ghostly
impression
probably
that
was
the
other
man
impression
for
who
ever
saw
pity
make
the
same
speed
as
fear
another
man
after
this
approached
who
was
a
workman
on
the
line
and
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
he
seemed
to
understand
at
once
what
had
occurred
coming
forward
quickly
he
looked
me
over
went
away
and
in
a
minute
or
two
returned
with
the
assistance
of
several
others
to
convey
me
to
the
station
a
number
of
people
were
still
there
so
that
when
i
was
placed
in
the
waiting
room
to
bide
the
arrival
of
a
doctor
i
could
see
no
other
way
of
keeping
a
calm
face
before
such
a
number
of
eyes
than
by
taking
out
my
pipe
and
smoking
an
action
which
i
am
told
caused
much
sensation
in
the
local
press
chapter
xx
hospitality
i
bore
this
accident
with
an
outward
fortitude
that
was
far
from
the
true
state
of
my
feelings
the
doctor
seeing
the
even
development
of
my
body
asked
me
if
i
was
an
athlete
although
i
could
scarcely
claim
to
be
one
i
had
been
able
without
any
training
and
at
any
time
to
jump
over
a
height
of
five
feet
had
also
been
a
swimmer
and
when
occasion
offered
had
donned
the
gloves
thinking
of
my
present
helplessness
caused
me
many
a
bitter
moment
but
i
managed
to
impress
all
comers
with
a
false
indifference
what
a
race
of
people
are
these
canadians
here
was
i
an
entire
stranger
among
them
and
yet
every
hour
people
were
making
enquiries
and
interesting
themselves
on
my
behalf
bringing
and
sending
books
grapes
bananas
and
other
delicacies
for
a
sick
man
when
a
second
operation
was
deemed
necessary
the
leg
to
be
amputated
at
the
knee
the
whole
town
was
concerned
and
the
doctors
had
to
give
strict
injunctions
not
to
admit
such
a
number
of
kind
hearted
visitors
at
this
time
i
was
so
weak
of
body
that
it
was
hopeless
to
expect
recovery
from
this
second
operation
this
was
soon
made
apparent
to
me
by
the
doctor
question
as
to
whether
i
had
any
message
to
send
to
my
people
hinting
that
there
was
a
slight
possibility
of
dying
under
the
chloroform
a
minister
of
the
gospel
was
also
there
and
his
sympathetic
face
certainly
made
the
dying
seem
probable
now
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
of
dying
men
having
a
foresight
of
things
to
be
but
i
confess
that
i
was
never
more
calm
in
all
my
life
than
at
this
moment
when
death
seemed
so
certain
i
did
not
for
one
instant
believe
or
expect
that
these
eyes
would
again
open
to
the
light
after
i
had
been
in
this
low
vital
condition
deadened
and
darkened
for
over
two
hours
whilst
my
body
was
being
cut
and
sawn
like
so
much
wood
or
stone
and
yet
i
felt
no
terror
of
death
i
had
been
taken
in
a
sleigh
from
the
station
to
the
hospital
over
a
mile
or
more
of
snow
and
the
one
thought
that
worried
me
most
when
i
was
supposed
to
be
face
to
face
with
death
was
whether
the
town
lay
north
south
east
or
west
from
the
hospital
and
this
i
believe
was
the
last
question
i
asked
after
hearing
an
answer
i
drew
in
the
chloroform
in
long
breaths
thinking
to
assist
the
doctors
in
their
work
in
spite
of
this
i
have
a
faint
recollection
of
struggling
with
all
my
might
against
its
effects
previous
to
losing
consciousness
but
i
was
greatly
surprised
on
being
afterwards
told
that
i
had
when
in
that
condition
used
more
foul
language
in
ten
minutes
delirium
than
had
probably
been
used
in
hours
by
the
whole
population
of
canada
it
was
explained
to
me
that
such
language
was
not
unusual
in
cases
of
this
kind
which
consoled
me
not
a
little
but
i
could
not
help
wondering
if
the
matron
had
been
present
and
if
she
had
confided
in
her
daughter
the
latter
was
a
young
girl
of
sixteen
years
or
thereabouts
and
was
so
womanly
and
considerate
that
her
mother
could
very
well
leave
her
in
charge
of
the
patients
for
the
whole
day
although
this
had
not
been
necessary
during
my
stay
for
three
days
after
this
operation
i
hovered
between
life
and
death
any
breath
expected
to
be
my
last
but
in
seven
or
eight
days
my
vitality
which
must
be
considered
wonderful
returned
in
a
small
way
and
i
was
then
considered
to
be
well
out
of
danger
it
was
at
this
time
that
the
kindness
of
these
people
touched
me
to
the
heart
the
hospital
was
situated
at
the
end
of
a
long
road
and
all
people
after
they
had
passed
the
last
house
which
was
some
distance
away
were
then
known
to
be
visitors
to
the
matron
or
one
of
her
patients
on
the
verandah
outside
sat
the
matron
dog
and
long
before
people
were
close
at
hand
he
barked
and
so
prepared
us
for
their
coming
when
it
was
known
that
i
was
convalescent
this
dog
was
kept
so
busy
barking
that
his
sharp
clear
voice
became
hoarse
with
the
exertion
they
came
single
they
came
in
twos
and
threes
old
people
young
people
and
children
until
it
became
necessary
to
give
them
a
more
formal
reception
limiting
each
person
or
couple
as
it
might
be
to
a
few
minutes
conversation
on
hearing
that
i
was
fond
of
reading
books
were
at
once
brought
by
their
owners
or
sent
by
others
some
of
which
i
had
not
the
courage
to
read
nor
the
heart
to
return
judging
them
wrongly
perhaps
by
their
titles
of
this
character
friend
little
billie
button
and
sally
sacrifice
with
such
good
attendance
within
and
so
much
kindness
from
without
what
wonder
that
i
was
now
fit
to
return
to
england
five
weeks
after
the
accident
after
having
undergone
two
serious
operations
my
new
friends
in
that
distant
land
would
persuade
me
to
remain
assuring
me
of
a
comfortable
living
but
i
decided
to
return
to
england
as
soon
as
possible
little
knowing
what
my
experience
would
be
in
the
years
following
when
the
morning
came
for
my
departure
the
matron
in
a
motherly
way
put
her
two
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
kissed
me
her
eyes
being
full
of
tears
this
coming
from
a
person
whose
business
was
to
show
no
emotion
doing
which
would
make
her
unfit
for
her
position
made
me
forget
the
short
laugh
and
the
cold
hand
shake
for
which
my
mind
had
prepared
itself
and
i
felt
my
voice
gone
and
my
throat
in
the
clutches
of
something
new
to
my
experience
i
left
without
having
the
voice
to
say
on
my
way
i
had
to
wish
to
every
one
i
met
and
when
at
last
this
ordeal
was
over
and
i
was
in
the
train
on
my
way
back
to
montreal
i
felt
that
i
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
travel
my
courage
forsook
me
and
i
sat
pale
and
despondent
for
i
never
expected
to
meet
these
people
again
and
they
were
true
friends
soon
i
reached
montreal
only
two
months
had
elapsed
and
what
a
difference
now
two
months
ago
and
it
was
winter
snow
was
on
the
earth
and
the
air
was
cold
but
i
was
then
full
limbed
full
of
vitality
and
good
spirits
for
summer
like
prospects
golden
and
glorious
possessed
me
night
and
day
it
was
summer
now
the
earth
was
dry
and
green
and
the
air
warm
but
winter
was
within
me
for
i
felt
crushed
and
staggered
on
crutches
to
the
danger
of
myself
and
the
people
on
my
way
i
soon
got
over
this
unpleasant
feeling
roused
by
the
aboard
ship
the
loudest
and
most
persistent
strange
to
say
being
a
man
who
defied
all
neptune
attempts
to
make
him
walk
unsteady
seeing
this
man
so
merry
i
knew
that
my
sensitiveness
would
soon
wear
off
and
seeing
him
so
active
was
a
great
encouragement
i
was
soon
home
again
having
been
away
less
than
four
months
but
all
the
wildness
had
been
taken
out
of
me
and
my
adventures
after
this
were
not
of
my
own
seeking
but
the
result
of
circumstances
chapter
xxi
london
sitting
at
home
thinking
of
future
employment
manual
labour
being
now
out
of
the
question
it
was
then
for
the
first
time
that
i
expressed
gratitude
for
my
old
grandmother
legacy
which
on
my
home
coming
from
the
states
had
been
reduced
from
ten
shillings
to
eight
shillings
per
week
in
the
past
it
had
been
sniffed
at
and
scorned
being
called
several
names
such
as
a
week
tobacco
a
day
grub
or
an
evening
booze
without
cigars
i
had
been
very
bitter
on
the
reading
of
her
will
that
the
property
had
not
come
into
my
hands
to
sell
or
retain
spend
or
save
but
a
little
common
sense
now
told
me
that
if
such
had
been
the
case
i
would
at
the
present
time
have
been
without
either
property
or
income
and
had
been
so
less
than
twelve
months
after
her
death
the
old
lady
no
doubt
had
noted
my
wildness
and
to
save
me
the
temptation
to
squander
my
brother
share
who
was
incapable
of
taking
charge
of
his
own
affairs
and
whose
share
i
must
have
ill
managed
after
the
passing
of
my
own
she
had
wisely
left
this
property
to
remain
in
the
hands
of
a
trustee
which
now
turned
out
as
lucky
for
myself
as
for
my
brother
i
was
now
more
content
with
my
lot
determined
that
as
my
body
had
failed
my
brains
should
now
have
the
chance
they
had
longed
for
when
the
spirit
had
been
bullied
into
submission
by
the
body
activity
it
was
now
the
middle
of
summer
and
daily
i
sat
dreaming
reading
and
occasionally
writing
in
a
leafy
bower
in
the
garden
i
could
now
dispense
with
crutches
having
just
received
from
london
an
artificial
limb
and
on
this
was
practising
taking
short
walks
at
night
with
a
success
that
was
gratifying
a
far
different
klondyke
had
opened
up
before
my
eyes
which
corresponded
with
the
dreams
of
my
youth
i
pictured
myself
returning
home
not
with
gold
nuggets
from
the
far
west
but
with
literary
fame
wrested
from
no
less
a
place
than
the
mighty
london
this
secret
was
never
divulged
to
my
people
and
in
the
after
years
this
reticence
saved
them
from
many
a
pang
of
disappointment
and
freed
me
from
many
an
awkward
question
determined
to
lose
no
time
in
the
conquest
of
that
city
which
i
expected
would
be
surrendered
to
me
some
time
within
twelve
months
i
began
without
wasting
more
time
in
dreams
to
make
preparations
for
this
journey
alas
how
many
greater
men
failed
in
a
lifetime
at
this
attempt
although
they
now
stand
triumphant
in
death
holding
in
their
spiritual
hands
the
freedom
and
keys
of
the
whole
world
cities
with
a
cotton
shirt
a
pair
of
stockings
and
a
handkerchief
in
a
brown
paper
parcel
and
the
sum
of
two
pounds
in
my
pocket
after
the
expense
of
train
fare
i
started
for
london
filled
to
the
brim
with
the
aforesaid
designs
my
failure
in
the
states
and
again
in
canada
had
made
me
a
little
more
chary
with
my
confidence
but
i
was
not
in
the
least
the
less
optimistic
my
first
dreams
were
and
are
my
best
i
scorn
clothes
and
jewellery
i
would
rather
take
a
free
country
walk
leaving
the
roads
for
the
less
trodden
paths
of
the
hills
and
the
lanes
than
ride
in
a
yacht
or
a
coach
i
would
rather
see
the
moon
in
the
ruins
than
the
gaslight
of
an
assembly
room
gluttony
i
despise
and
drink
is
seldom
taken
except
at
the
invitation
of
other
eyes
then
what
in
the
name
of
everything
we
know
would
be
to
me
the
silver
and
gold
of
all
alaska
i
arrived
in
london
early
the
following
morning
and
at
once
made
my
way
towards
lambeth
early
that
night
being
tired
with
the
exertion
of
an
unusually
long
day
i
went
seeking
for
lodgings
in
blackfriars
road
and
seeing
several
signs
that
claimed
to
accommodate
working
men
with
good
clean
beds
at
sixpence
per
night
entered
one
of
these
establishments
paid
the
amount
demanded
and
was
then
ushered
into
a
long
kitchen
preferring
to
sit
and
smoke
for
an
hour
before
retiring
for
the
night
some
thirty
or
forty
men
were
in
this
kitchen
but
the
british
workman
had
either
not
yet
arrived
was
out
drinking
his
pint
or
had
gone
early
to
bed
this
was
not
by
any
means
my
first
experience
in
england
of
lodging
houses
for
i
had
been
forced
to
live
in
similar
places
on
my
visits
in
cattle
ships
from
america
but
i
certainly
did
not
like
the
look
of
this
place
where
no
sign
of
authority
was
to
be
seen
and
which
seemed
to
be
entirely
left
to
the
control
of
these
noisy
men
some
of
these
lodgers
had
been
old
soldiers
had
just
received
their
pensions
the
accumulation
of
three
months
a
number
of
them
were
bringing
in
cans
of
beer
and
the
kitchen
was
in
an
uproar
many
of
them
were
too
drunk
to
perform
this
task
but
were
sufficiently
sober
to
sit
awake
and
give
money
and
orders
to
others
and
there
was
no
lack
of
willing
hands
to
bring
them
what
they
required
i
left
the
kitchen
at
once
determined
to
seek
another
place
without
troubling
the
landlady
to
refund
my
money
as
i
left
the
kitchen
two
drunken
men
began
to
fight
others
interfered
and
this
fight
threatened
to
become
an
all
round
affair
when
i
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
feeling
my
way
in
the
dark
i
found
the
landlady
standing
at
the
office
door
seeing
me
as
i
was
about
to
pass
her
she
said
in
a
voice
which
was
the
worse
for
drink
so
you
want
to
go
to
bed
here
jim
show
this
gentleman
to
his
bed
jim
obeyed
a
small
child
whom
i
mechanically
followed
up
two
flights
of
stairs
which
were
better
lighted
than
those
leading
to
the
kitchen
which
was
in
the
basement
of
the
house
he
then
showed
me
into
a
room
where
there
were
a
number
of
beds
and
pointing
to
one
said
you
are
number
when
he
left
the
room
many
of
the
beds
already
contained
sleepers
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
mine
wondering
if
there
would
be
any
disturbance
in
the
night
whether
any
of
these
men
would
take
a
fancy
to
my
clothes
or
in
the
dark
were
likely
to
rummage
their
contents
the
man
in
the
next
bed
coughed
and
then
turning
towards
me
said
gently
the
beds
are
good
i
admit
but
that
is
about
all
you
can
say
of
this
house
second
voice
not
far
away
you
come
to
a
good
house
you
have
and
yer
do
know
it
first
voice
if
i
had
been
drunk
last
night
and
got
chucked
out
of
rowton
i
would
on
any
account
be
here
a
third
voice
distant
but
loud
and
angry
give
over
will

when
are
you
coves
going
to
sleep
i
ai
done
any
labour
for
three
weeks
and
now

four
in
the
mornin
blow
me

i
ai
robbed
of
my
slumber

was
said
after
this
i
at
once
made
up
my
mind
to
try
rowton
house
on
the
following
day
that
they
had
refused
this
man
a
bed
owing
to
his
being
drunk
and
more
than
likely
quarrelsome
in
drink
was
a
strong
recommendation
to
me
after
my
experience
here
where
it
would
be
impossible
to
either
read
write
or
think
or
to
even
partake
of
my
meals
in
comfort
the
following
morning
after
having
had
breakfast
at
an
eating
house
i
enquired
for
rowton
house
and
when
the
first
person
i
addressed
asked
which
one
i
wanted
i
answered
him
the
nearest
one
this
proved
to
be
in
newington
butts
and
after
receiving
instructions
i
proceeded
accordingly
and
was
soon
standing
outside
that
place
where
i
was
to
remain
for
two
years
without
in
the
least
impressing
london
to
my
surprise
i
found
this
house
to
be
a
fine
large
block
of
red
buildings
with
an
imposing
front
and
a
fine
entrance
polished
and
clean
and
facing
its
many
front
windows
was
an
old
church
tower
and
clock
set
in
an
old
leafy
churchyard
that
had
stones
for
the
dead
and
a
number
of
wooden
seats
for
the
living
on
making
an
application
for
a
bed
i
learnt
that
this
could
not
be
granted
until
nine
in
the
evening
but
was
courteously
allowed
the
privilege
of
remaining
indoors
until
that
time
this
place
surprised
me
by
its
accommodation
of
dining
rooms
library
sitting
rooms
baths
lavatories
all
being
kept
clean
and
in
thorough
good
order
by
a
large
staff
of
men
its
charge
being
sixpence
per
night
on
making
my
way
into
the
library
and
seeing
two
large
cases
of
books
one
containing
fiction
and
the
other
being
enriched
by
the
poets
historians
essayists
with
biography
and
miscellaneous
literature
and
hearing
how
quiet
this
room
was
in
spite
of
the
presence
of
over
a
hundred
men
i
at
once
made
up
my
mind
to
pay
a
week
lodgings
down
indifferent
whether
the
sleeping
accommodation
was
good
or
bad
this
i
did
at
nine
after
which
i
sat
sometimes
reading
the
paper
and
again
watching
the
faces
of
this
mixed
assembly
some
of
them
were
of
refined
appearance
with
their
silk
hats
their
frock
coats
cuffs
and
collars
and
spoke
in
voices
subdued
and
gentle
some
of
them
were
of
such
a
prosperous
appearance
that
no
doubt
i
had
already
passed
them
in
the
street
thinking
they
were
either
merchants
or
managers
of
great
concerns
and
more
likely
than
not
the
paper
boys
had
followed
on
their
heels
and
the
cabmen
had
persistently
hailed
them
if
i
wanted
to
devote
my
time
to
study
living
on
eight
shillings
per
week
this
was
apparently
a
suitable
place
for
my
purpose
being
my
own
barber
doing
my
own
plain
cooking
and
living
abstemiously
renouncing
drink
and
the
pleasures
of
theatres
and
other
indoor
entertainments
and
retaining
tobacco
as
my
sole
luxury
i
saw
no
reason
why
this
could
not
be
done
at
the
same
time
making
up
my
mind
that
it
had
to
be
done
i
had
been
here
little
more
than
a
week
when
i
set
to
work
in
earnest
and
the
result
of
two
months
diligence
was
a
tragedy
written
in
blank
verse
and
which
i
called
the
robber
never
dreaming
but
what
it
would
at
once
meet
with
success
owing
to
its
being
full
of
action
a
very
difficult
thing
to
marry
to
verse
but
which
i
thought
was
successfully
accomplished
i
was
somewhat
taken
aback
to
have
it
returned
to
me
on
the
third
day
with
the
regret
now
it
seemed
that
the
rowton
house
had
a
bad
name
owing
to
the
great
number
of
criminals
that
were
continually
in
the
police
courts
giving
that
address
some
of
these
lodgers
for
that
very
reason
had
their
correspondence
addressed
to
various
small
shops
where
they
were
customers
for
tobacco
papers
and
groceries
on
having
this
tragedy
returned
i
thinking
of
this
came
to
the
conclusion
that
no
respectable
person
would
be
likely
to
consider
or
respect
any
work
or
application
for
the
same
that
emanated
from
a
house
of
this
name
i
spoke
to
a
gentleman
with
whom
i
had
become
acquainted
on
this
difficult
subject
and
he
agreed
with
me
saying
that
such
were
the
true
facts
of
the
case
but
said
he
after
a
thoughtful
pause
as
your
means
are
so
limited
and
the
shopkeepers
charge
one
penny
for
every
letter
they
receive
on
a
customer
behalf
would
it
not
be
as
well
to
still
have
your
correspondence
addressed
here
but
in
another
way
of
which
you
probably
have
not
heard
give
your
address
as
number
one
churchyard
row
and
although
people
will
not
recognise
this
house
under
that
name
yet
the
post
office
authorities
will
know
it
for
its
proper
address
this
i
did
without
further
question
and
the
robber
was
despatched
on
a
second
journey
fourteen
days
after
my
robber
returned
to
number
one
churchyard
row
bothering
my
head
to
account
for
this
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
my
tragedy
had
not
been
read
farther
than
the
front
page
and
that
a
tragedy
that
was
born
and
bred
in
such
a
place
as
churchyard
row
the
address
being
so
appropriate
to
the
nature
of
the
work
was
enough
to
make
any
man
who
had
the
least
sense
of
humour
condemn
it
with
a
laugh
my
conceit
at
this
time
was
foolish
in
the
extreme
and
yet
i
was
near
my
thirtieth
year
the
next
work
was
a
very
long
poem
in
which
the
beasts
of
the
field
the
birds
of
the
air
and
even
the
fishes
of
the
sea
met
in
a
forest
glade
to
impeach
man
for
his
cruelty
to
them
and
went
on
to
describe
their
journey
at
midnight
to
the
nearest
town
and
the
vengeance
they
then
took
on
the
sleeping
inhabitants
my
confidence
in
this
work
being
accepted
could
not
have
been
altogether
for
the
following
reason
i
made
two
copies
of
this
poem
and
posted
them
simultaneously
to
different
publishers
i
felt
quite
satisfied
that
one
of
these
would
be
accepted
but
when
a
whole
week
had
passed
on
and
i
had
received
no
communication
from
either
publisher
i
was
then
horrified
to
think
that
they
both
were
giving
the
poem
such
a
consideration
that
there
was
a
probability
that
both
of
them
would
accept
it
and
that
both
publishers
would
call
on
me
to
make
terms
perhaps
at
the
very
same
hour
this
thought
so
preyed
on
my
mind
that
i
did
not
feel
at
all
easy
until
i
had
one
of
the
copies
returned
but
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
receive
the
second
copy
on
the
following
day
thinking
that
short
poems
would
stand
a
better
prospect
of
being
accepted
i
set
to
work
on
a
hundred
sonnets
writing
five
and
sometimes
six
a
day
but
when
this
number
had
been
accomplished
and
submitted
this
work
met
with
the
same
failure
after
this
i
wrote
another
tragedy
a
comedy
a
volume
of
humorous
essays
and
hundreds
i
believe
of
short
poems
i
was
always
writing
at
this
time
either
beginning
or
finishing
a
work
but
strange
to
say
none
of
this
work
was
being
sent
out
but
was
safely
treasured
under
the
impression
that
it
would
some
day
find
its
market
after
having
had
twelve
months
practice
in
the
last
months
of
which
no
attempt
had
been
made
at
publication
i
decided
to
make
one
more
effort
this
time
with
a
small
volume
of
short
poems
this
was
immediately
sent
to
a
well
known
publisher
who
in
a
few
days
returned
answer
offering
to
publish
at
the
author
expense
the
sum
needed
being
pounds
this
success
completely
turned
my
head
with
all
my
heart
i
believed
that
there
would
not
be
the
least
difficulty
in
procuring
money
for
such
a
grand
purpose
and
at
once
wrote
to
several
well
known
philanthropists
writing
six
letters
two
of
them
never
murmured
and
the
other
four
set
their
secretaries
to
snap
me
up
in
a
few
words
exasperated
at
this
i
wrote
to
several
others
all
my
trouble
being
to
no
purpose
now
when
i
first
entered
this
lodging
house
i
had
something
like
thirty
shillings
to
the
good
being
ahead
of
my
income
and
up
to
the
present
had
no
reason
for
spending
this
amount
could
i
put
this
to
some
use
my
mind
had
several
plans
and
one
in
particular
seemed
good
and
feasible
i
would
write
three
or
four
short
poems
on
a
page
get
them
printed
and
sell
them
from
door
to
door
two
thousand
of
these
sheets
sold
at
threepence
per
copy
would
be
pounds
and
no
doubt
i
could
sell
quite
a
hundred
of
these
copies
a
day
providing
i
went
from
house
to
house
from
street
to
street
from
early
morning
till
late
at
night
with
this
object
i
lost
no
time
in
seeing
a
job
printer
and
was
told
that
shillings
would
be
needed
to
defray
expenses
this
large
amount
disappointed
me
not
a
little
but
i
paid
a
deposit
and
went
back
to
the
house
where
i
lived
and
nearly
starved
in
saving
four
shillings
that
were
short
which
was
done
in
two
weeks
out
of
the
sixteen
shillings
that
were
to
maintain
me
in
food
and
lodgings
for
fourteen
days
at
last
after
great
privation
and
sacrifice
it
was
done
and
i
received
from
the
printer
two
thousand
and
some
odd
copies
early
the
next
morning
i
was
to
be
seen
in
the
suburbs
of
london
with
my
hands
and
pockets
full
of
these
copies
going
from
door
to
door
i
mentioned
to
the
inhabitants
that
i
had
had
an
offer
from
a
publisher
and
that
he
could
not
undertake
to
publish
my
work
under
pounds
all
these
people
did
was
to
stare
none
of
them
seeming
to
understand
and
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
ask
questions
i
had
i
believe
visited
the
doors
of
some
thirty
houses
or
more
and
had
not
sold
one
copy
most
of
these
people
were
poor
and
some
had
become
sufficiently
interested
to
enquire
the
price
of
my
copies
seeming
inclined
and
willing
to
trade
with
me
in
a
small
way
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
give
threepence
for
a
sheet
of
paper
which
they
did
not
understand
at
last
i
chanced
upon
a
house
that
was
much
larger
than
the
others
at
which
place
a
servant
answered
the
door
i
lost
no
time
in
relating
to
her
the
true
facts
of
the
case
and
she
was
standing
there
silent
and
puzzled
as
to
my
meaning
when
her
mistress
called
to
her
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
mary
who
there
on
which
the
maiden
gave
answer
in
a
halting
voice
some
man
selling
some
paper
at
this
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
same
voice
said
from
the
direction
of
the
stairs
give
him
this
penny
and
tell
him
to
go
away
and
almost
instantly
that
copper
coin
fell
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
came
rolling
rapidly
towards
us
as
though
aware
of
its
mission
the
girl
handed
me
this
penny
which
i
took
mechanically
at
the
same
time
persisting
in
her
taking
a
copy
to
her
mistress
that
lady
hearing
our
further
conversation
and
perhaps
guessing
its
import
cried
again
this
time
in
a
warning
voice
mary
mind
you
do
take
anything
from
him
this
crushed
the
last
hope
for
i
began
to
think
that
if
this
lady
who
might
be
a
woman
of
some
cultivation
and
rich
could
only
see
and
read
what
had
been
done
she
might
have
at
once
in
her
deep
interest
merged
the
whole
pounds
at
the
same
time
befriending
me
for
life
alas
i
have
been
unfortunate
all
my
life
in
believing
that
there
were
a
great
number
of
rich
people
who
were
only
too
eager
to
come
forward
and
help
talent
in
distress
i
was
so
disgusted
at
receiving
this
single
penny
and
being
so
dismissed
that
i
at
once
put
the
sheets
back
in
my
pockets
and
returned
to
the
city
how
long
would
it
take
to
get
pounds
at
this
rate
what
am
i
talking
about
money
was
lost
not
even
this
single
copper
was
a
gain
for
this
experience
had
cost
me
three
pennies
in
tram
fare
without
mention
of
a
more
expensive
breakfast
than
i
usually
had
when
i
got
back
to
the
house
i
started
with
the
fury
of
a
madman
to
burn
the
copies
and
did
not
rest
until
they
were
all
destroyed
taking
care
not
to
save
one
copy
that
would
at
any
time
in
the
future
remind
me
of
my
folly
it
was
at
this
time
that
i
came
under
the
influence
of
flanagan
that
gentleman
seeing
me
often
writing
and
apparently
in
deep
thought
at
once
gave
me
credit
for
more
wisdom
than
i
possessed
he
was
a
very
illiterate
man
having
no
knowledge
of
grammar
punctuation
or
spelling
the
upshot
of
this
acquaintance
was
that
he
informed
me
in
confidence
that
he
was
the
lawful
heir
to
nearly
half
the
county
of
mayo
in
ireland
on
which
estate
was
a
house
like
the
king
palace
in
exchange
for
this
confidence
i
told
him
that
i
was
the
author
of
a
book
of
verse
which
could
not
be
published
except
the
author
defrayed
expenses
on
which
flanagan
expressed
much
sympathy
more
especially
when
i
read
him
aloud
a
few
lines
expressing
my
disapproval
of
landowners
and
rich
tyrants
and
promised
sincerely
to
relieve
me
of
all
difficulty
providing
of
course
that
he
made
good
his
claims
to
the
estate
flanagan
then
proposed
that
i
should
put
some
of
his
arguments
in
grammatical
form
which
he
would
immediately
forward
to
the
proper
authorities
this
i
began
to
do
at
once
and
some
of
flanagan
arguments
were
so
strong
that
i
am
surprised
at
the
present
day
at
being
a
free
man
i
told
one
eminent
statesman
that
he
should
retire
and
give
place
to
a
more
honest
man
and
another
that
though
he
was
born
in
ireland
and
bore
the
name
of
an
irishman
yet
he
was
a
traitor
for
his
heart
had
ever
been
in
england
despite
these
powerful
letters
the
county
mayo
never
to
my
knowledge
changed
hands
and
i
was
disappointed
in
my
expectations
and
flanagan
grieved
daily
at
that
time
i
must
confess
i
thoroughly
believed
flanagan
perhaps
through
being
blinded
by
my
own
ambitions
as
an
author
even
at
the
present
time
though
i
have
cut
down
the
estate
considerably
from
half
a
county
to
half
an
acre
and
have
taken
out
quite
a
number
of
windows
from
the
estate
residence
after
doing
this
i
still
believe
that
poor
flanagan
was
robbed
of
a
cottage
and
garden
by
an
avaricious
landlord
this
was
at
the
time
of
the
boer
war
and
flanagan
long
dark
beard
and
slouched
hat
gave
him
the
exact
appearance
of
one
of
those
despised
people
therefore
we
seldom
took
a
walk
together
but
what
we
were
stoned
by
boys
in
the
street
and
even
grown
up
people
passed
insulting
remarks
in
fact
everywhere
we
went
we
were
regarded
with
suspicion
our
clothes
not
being
of
the
best
drew
the
attention
of
attendants
at
museums
and
art
galleries
and
we
being
swarthy
and
alien
in
appearance
never
paused
near
a
palace
but
what
sentry
and
police
watched
our
every
movement
one
morning
we
were
passing
through
whitehall
what
time
a
regiment
of
soldiers
were
being
drilled
and
inspected
by
a
gentleman
in
a
silk
hat
now
flanagan
was
a
man
of
great
courage
and
never
thought
it
necessary
to
whisper
therefore
a
vein
of
savage
satire
broke
in
flanagan
heart
when
he
beheld
a
man
in
a
silk
hat
inspecting
a
troop
of
soldiers
see
he
cried
there
a
sight
for
the
boers
a
number
of
bystanders
resented
this
remark
and
there
were
loud
murmurs
of
disapproval
on
which
flanagan
asked
the
following
question
will
the
best
man
in
the
crowd
step
forward
but
no
man
seemed
inclined
to
attempt
chastisement
without
being
assisted
although
i
did
not
entirely
approve
of
him
on
this
occasion
still
seeing
that
the
words
could
not
be
recalled
i
was
quite
prepared
to
be
carried
with
him
half
dead
on
a
stretcher
to
the
nearest
hospital
for
i
liked
the
man
and
he
certainly
seemed
to
like
me
since
he
always
took
his
walks
alone
when
i
did
not
accompany
him
chapter
xxii
the
ark
i
had
now
been
two
years
in
london
at
the
same
place
and
though
my
literary
efforts
had
not
been
very
successful
i
must
confess
that
the
conditions
had
not
been
the
most
unfavourable
for
study
and
no
doubt
i
had
cultivated
my
mind
not
a
little
by
the
reading
of
standard
works
the
conditions
of
this
place
could
not
have
been
bettered
by
a
person
of
such
small
means
and
probably
i
would
have
continued
living
here
until
i
met
with
some
success
had
i
not
known
of
one
who
would
be
thankful
of
a
couple
of
shillings
a
week
and
resolved
to
make
a
little
sacrifice
that
would
enable
me
to
send
them
to
do
this
it
was
necessary
to
seek
cheaper
lodgings
where
rent
not
being
so
high
this
amount
could
be
saved
i
had
heard
something
of
such
a
place
in
southwark
which
was
under
the
control
of
the
salvation
army
a
bed
was
to
be
had
there
for
two
shillings
per
week
therefore
one
and
sixpence
would
be
saved
at
the
onset
as
i
was
now
paying
three
and
sixpence
following
my
first
impulse
as
usual
but
with
much
regret
at
having
to
leave
a
place
where
i
had
not
by
any
means
been
unhappy
i
gathered
up
my
few
things
and
left
and
that
night
settled
in
southwark
street
speaking
after
six
months
experience
at
the
salvation
army
lodging
house
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
say
in
its
favour
of
course
it
was
well
understood
by
the
lodgers
whatever
people
on
the
outside
thought
that
no
charity
was
dispensed
on
the
premises
certainly
the
food
was
cheap
but
such
food
as
was
not
fit
for
a
human
being
i
do
not
know
whether
the
place
came
under
the
control
of
the
london
county
council
being
regarded
as
a
charitable
institution
or
whether
in
case
of
a
surprise
visit
from
its
inspectors
beds
were
removed
in
the
day
what
i
do
know
from
experience
is
this
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
a
man
could
find
room
between
the
beds
to
undress
a
row
of
fifteen
or
twenty
beds
would
be
so
close
together
that
they
might
as
well
be
called
one
bed
men
were
breathing
and
coughing
in
each
other
faces
and
the
stench
of
such
a
number
of
men
in
one
room
was
abominable
i
was
fortunate
in
having
a
bed
next
to
the
wall
to
which
i
could
turn
my
face
and
escape
the
breath
of
the
man
in
the
next
bed
the
officers
in
charge
were
according
to
my
first
opinion
hypocrites
which
seemed
to
be
verified
some
time
after
from
head
quarters
for
both
the
captain
and
his
lieutenant
were
dismissed
from
the
army
however
the
captain
was
well
liked
by
the
lodgers
and
i
have
often
seen
him
assist
them
out
of
his
own
private
purse
as
for
the
lieutenant
he
was
very
gentle
and
fervent
in
prayer
more
so
than
any
man
i
have
ever
heard
but
in
conversation
he
had
not
a
civil
word
for
any
one
except
of
course
his
superior
officer
he
sometimes
made
his
deceit
so
apparent
that
i
have
been
forced
to
laugh
out
when
the
captain
arrived
at
night
or
in
the
morning
he
was
a
married
man
and
did
not
live
on
the
premises
he
would
stand
with
his
back
to
the
restaurant
bar
looking
down
the
long
room
at
the
faces
of
his
many
lodgers
it
was
at
such
a
time
that
when
i
have
looked
up
from
my
meal
i
have
been
surprised
and
not
a
little
startled
to
see
this
lieutenant
pale
thin
face
looking
down
through
a
glass
window
eager
to
see
what
his
superior
officer
was
doing
so
engrossed
would
he
be
that
he
would
entirely
forget
that
he
exposed
his
deceit
to
the
eyes
of
a
number
of
men
who
had
their
faces
turned
towards
him
sometimes
he
would
creep
tiptoe
to
the
kitchen
door
and
peep
in
for
an
instant
and
then
creep
back
to
the
office
i
have
often
wondered
that
the
captain
never
turned
and
surprised
him
in
these
doings
for
there
was
not
a
lodger
in
the
house
that
had
not
one
time
or
another
seen
him
perform
them
on
sunday
afternoons
these
two
the
captain
and
his
lieutenant
would
conduct
a
meeting
the
latter
commencing
it
with
a
short
prayer
after
which
the
former
would
preach
a
sermon
which
was
i
must
confess
often
interesting
and
invariably
eloquent
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
heard
a
more
pathetic
address
and
prayer
than
that
which
was
delivered
by
this
captain
on
one
of
these
sunday
afternoons
it
so
chanced
that
in
this
place
there
lived
a
poor
half
demented
lodger
who
was
known
by
the
name
of
horace
whose
profession
was
that
of
a
flower
seller
every
night
this
man
would
dress
and
garland
himself
with
his
unsold
flowers
and
return
home
drunk
to
the
ark
now
this
man
suddenly
disappeared
and
at
the
same
time
a
man
committed
suicide
from
london
bridge
which
was
well
known
to
be
the
haunt
of
the
man
horace
whereat
the
following
sunday
our
captain
preached
a
funeral
oration
giving
for
our
interest
the
few
facts
he
had
gleaned
from
the
past
life
of
the
deceased
who
the
captain
affirmed
had
received
a
good
education
and
had
come
of
a
respectable
family
the
captain
wept
copiously
being
overcome
by
his
feelings
and
the
lieutenant
approved
and
encouraged
him
by
an
unusual
number
of
sighs
and
broken
sobs
the
meeting
then
ended
with
an
earnest
prayer
for
the
soul
of
the
drowned
horace
about
six
days
after
this
meeting
had
taken
place
there
came
to
the
ark
a
man
drivelling
and
laughing
idiotically
with
wreaths
and
posies
all
over
his
person
no
other
than
the
lamented
horace
the
captain
came
out
of
his
office
followed
by
his
lieutenant
the
captain
looked
at
horace
with
a
melancholy
annoyance
the
lieutenant
looked
first
at
his
superior
officer
and
after
receiving
his
expression
into
his
own
face
turned
it
slowly
on
horace
the
captain
then
turned
slowly
on
his
heels
at
the
same
time
shaking
his
head
and
without
saying
a
word
returned
to
the
office
while
his
subordinate
followed
him
in
every
particular
never
after
this
did
this
captain
treat
horace
as
a
living
man
and
all
chaff
and
familiar
conversation
was
at
an
end
between
them
how
the
captain
came
to
the
belief
that
the
drowned
suicide
was
horace
the
flower
seller
was
very
strange
for
this
man
was
known
to
mysteriously
disappear
several
times
in
the
year
he
invariably
like
the
drowned
man
he
was
supposed
to
be
coming
to
the
surface
on
the
seventh
day
seven
days
being
the
extreme
penalty
of
his
simple
and
eccentric
behaviour
there
was
no
lack
of
strictness
at
this
place
whether
a
man
was
ill
or
not
whether
it
rained
snowed
or
hailed
every
lodger
was
compelled
to
quit
the
premises
at
ten
in
the
morning
after
which
it
would
remain
closed
for
cleaning
purposes
until
one
and
yet
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
house
could
keep
himself
clean
it
was
not
thought
necessary
to
close
other
establishments
of
this
kind
that
were
not
connected
with
the
name
of
religion
which
were
kept
cleaner
without
making
the
lodgers
suffer
any
inconvenience
why
things
should
be
carried
on
in
this
high
handed
fashion
i
can
not
understand
seeing
that
there
was
not
the
least
charity
doled
out
whatever
good
the
salvation
army
did
for
the
homeless
and
penniless
in
their
shelters
they
certainly
did
not
cater
well
for
these
poor
but
independent
fellows
whose
wages
ranged
from
a
shilling
to
eighteenpence
a
day
being
sandwichmen
who
receive
nothing
but
what
they
paid
for
i
had
been
at
this
place
something
like
four
months
when
i
determined
to
make
another
attempt
at
publication
my
plans
at
this
time
seemed
to
be
very
feasible
for
i
gave
them
a
full
half
year
for
execution
i
applied
at
the
local
police
station
for
a
pedlar
certificate
intending
to
stock
myself
with
laces
pins
needles
and
buttons
with
which
i
would
hawk
the
country
from
one
end
to
the
other
at
the
end
of
this
time
i
would
be
some
ten
pounds
in
pocket
the
result
of
not
drawing
my
income
and
would
no
doubt
save
between
nine
and
ten
shillings
a
week
as
a
hawker
being
very
impulsive
i
proposed
starting
on
this
interesting
business
at
once
but
one
idea
which
could
not
for
long
be
overlooked
brought
me
to
a
halt
my
artificial
leg
would
certainly
not
stand
the
strain
of
this
enforced
march
from
town
to
town
on
the
country
roads
that
were
so
often
rough
and
uneven
for
even
now
it
was
creaking
and
threatened
at
every
step
to
break
down
on
mentioning
these
difficulties
to
a
fellow
lodger
he
at
once
advised
me
to
go
to
the
surgical
aid
society
for
a
wooden
leg
of
the
common
peg
sort
which
he
was
pleased
to
mention
would
not
only
be
more
useful
for
such
a
knockabout
life
but
would
not
deceive
people
as
to
my
true
condition
this
society
was
visited
by
me
on
the
following
day
at
which
place
i
was
informed
that
fifteen
subscription
letters
would
be
required
for
my
purpose
and
after
paying
sixpence
for
a
subscription
book
in
which
were
the
names
and
addresses
of
several
thousand
subscribers
i
lost
no
time
in
buying
stamps
and
stationery
eighteen
letters
were
without
loss
of
time
written
and
posted
to
their
destination
these
eighteen
succeeded
in
bringing
in
two
subscription
letters
several
letters
of
regret
from
people
who
had
already
given
theirs
away
several
of
my
letters
were
returned
marked
not
at
home
and
a
number
of
them
elicited
no
response
twelve
more
letters
were
quickly
despatched
with
the
result
of
one
subscription
letter
to
be
able
to
do
this
i
was
forced
to
use
the
small
weekly
allowance
that
i
had
been
making
in
six
weeks
i
had
written
nearly
a
hundred
letters
and
was
still
several
letters
short
of
my
allotted
number
i
again
consulted
my
fellow
lodger
who
had
at
first
referred
me
to
the
surgical
aid
society
and
his
explanation
was
undoubtedly
reasonable
and
true
he
explained
that
not
only
was
the
time
of
the
year
unfavourable
it
being
summer
and
most
of
the
subscribers
were
away
from
home
on
their
holidays
but
unfortunately
the
south
african
war
was
still
in
progress
and
numbers
of
soldiers
were
daily
returning
from
the
front
in
need
of
artificial
assistance
one
way
or
another
although
i
ruminated
with
some
bitterness
on
the
idea
that
i
would
almost
pay
in
postage
the
value
of
that
which
i
required
before
it
became
mine
i
still
had
enough
to
see
that
no
one
was
actually
to
blame
several
letters
were
received
offering
to
assist
me
on
certain
conditions
one
lady
would
assist
on
a
clergyman
recommendation
and
another
subscriber
would
have
no
other
than
a
roman
priest
i
offered
to
get
these
ladies
a
salvation
army
officer
recommendation
which
apparently
would
not
do
for
our
correspondence
came
to
an
end
one
lady
who
did
not
recognise
the
house
of
salvation
under
the
address
of
southwark
street
regretted
that
she
had
already
given
her
letters
away
but
advised
me
to
go
to
the
salvation
army
who
would
most
certainly
attend
to
my
wants
i
explained
to
this
person
that
i
was
already
at
one
of
their
places
and
had
been
here
over
five
months
and
that
i
had
not
been
seen
drunk
in
the
place
and
that
my
behaviour
had
not
at
any
time
raised
objections
also
that
i
was
on
the
most
friendly
terms
with
the
officer
in
charge
but
that
i
could
live
here
for
many
years
to
come
and
no
man
would
enquire
my
wants
or
offer
to
assist
me
one
afternoon
when
i
returned
to
the
ark
after
having
been
out
all
day
i
was
surprised
to
hear
from
a
lodger
that
two
gentlemen
had
been
there
that
afternoon
to
see
me
after
which
another
lodger
came
forward
with
the
same
information
and
still
another
until
i
was
filled
with
curiosity
to
know
who
those
gentlemen
could
be
what
did
they
look
like
i
asked
one
like
solicitors
he
answered
what
kind
of
looking
men
were
they
i
asked
of
another
very
much
like
lawyers
he
answered
at
once
do
forget
to
remember
yer
old
pals
chimed
in
another
when
yer
come
into
the
property
first
i
examined
my
mother
side
of
the
family
and
then
my
father
but
could
find
no
relative
near
or
distant
at
home
or
abroad
whose
death
would
be
likely
to
befriend
me
at
last
i
went
to
the
office
but
found
this
place
closed
the
lieutenant
being
out
walking
and
the
captain
not
yet
having
arrived
never
in
my
life
did
i
have
such
an
excitable
half
hour
as
this
when
i
saw
the
captain
coming
forward
smiling
with
an
envelope
in
his
hand
i
went
to
meet
him
and
taking
the
letter
in
my
own
hand
began
to
examine
its
outside
of
course
said
the
captain
you
know
who
it
is
from
not
the
least
idea
i
said
how
should
i
and
proceeded
to
open
it
it
was
a
short
note
with
a
request
that
i
should
call
on
the
charity
organisation
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
eleven
on
the
day
following
the
captain
went
back
to
his
office
and
i
sat
down
thinking
of
what
this
would
amount
to
again
i
decided
to
consult
the
canadian
the
lodger
who
had
first
mentioned
to
me
the
surgical
aid
society
as
to
that
said
this
man
it
a
wonder
to
me
that
you
have
not
run
foul
of
these
people
before
now
my
friend
who
sells
papers
in
the
city
was
continually
meddled
and
interfered
with
by
these
people
but
they
gave
him
no
assistance
although
they
seemed
curious
to
know
all
about
him
this
information
surprised
me
not
a
little
but
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
canadian
friend
was
addicted
to
drink
and
other
bad
habits
and
was
an
undeserving
case
the
next
morning
i
arose
lighthearted
in
anticipation
of
hearing
something
to
my
good
and
was
leaving
the
house
when
i
saw
the
captain
standing
at
the
front
door
feeling
some
misgiving
i
turned
to
this
gentleman
and
asked
him
point
blank
what
was
his
opinion
of
the
charity
organisation
well
he
replied
slowly
to
give
you
my
candid
opinion
although
i
may
be
mistaken
the
object
of
the
charity
organisation
is
not
so
much
to
give
alms
as
to
prevent
alms
being
wasted
how
i
remembered
these
words
in
the
light
of
my
after
experience
with
these
people
at
ten
punctually
i
was
at
their
office
in
the
borough
road
and
was
at
once
shown
into
a
side
room
where
i
sat
waiting
patiently
for
an
hour
at
last
a
gentleman
in
black
came
forward
saying
very
politely
davies
will
you
please
come
this
way
i
followed
him
up
two
or
three
flights
of
stairs
and
we
entered
a
quiet
room
on
the
top
floor
seating
himself
at
a
table
and
taking
pencil
and
paper
he
then
asked
me
to
be
seated
and
began
davies
he
said
i
have
received
a
letter
from
a
lady
who
has
become
interested
in
your
case
and
wishes
to
better
your
conditions
so
as
to
answer
this
lady
it
is
necessary
to
know
something
of
yourself
for
which
reason
i
propose
asking
you
a
few
questions
which
of
course
you
need
not
answer
except
you
think
proper
this
he
proceeded
to
do
at
the
same
time
making
notes
of
my
answers
after
answering
a
dozen
or
more
questions
truthfully
dealing
with
particulars
of
my
family
and
my
past
life
he
brought
the
case
up
to
that
time
surely
he
said
you
do
not
live
on
eight
shillings
a
week
i
should
have
thought
that
to
be
impossible
as
for
that
i
answered
not
only
has
that
sum
been
sufficient
for
myself
but
i
have
been
able
to
make
another
an
allowance
of
two
shillings
a
week
but
have
not
been
able
to
do
so
since
i
applied
to
the
surgical
aid
society
now
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
that
leg
asked
this
gentleman
i
should
have
thought
that
it
would
last
for
another
two
years
at
least
excuse
me
did
you
get
that
through
the
society
no
i
said
it
cost
me
twelve
pounds
ten
shillings
when
i
could
ill
afford
the
money
but
unfortunately
i
knew
nothing
then
of
the
surgical
aid
society
the
society
no
doubt
does
a
large
amount
of
good
continued
this
gentleman
but
i
do
altogether
agree
with
their
methods
you
have
written
quite
a
number
of
letters
he
asked
and
i
do
suppose
any
of
the
subscribers
helped
you
with
the
postage
sending
you
a
trifle
to
defray
expenses
at
this
point
he
made
a
long
pause
and
i
began
to
tell
him
that
all
the
help
i
had
received
was
from
a
gentleman
who
having
no
letters
left
to
assist
me
with
had
very
considerately
sent
twelve
stamps
to
help
my
correspondence
the
charity
organisation
showed
much
interest
at
this
point
of
the
conversation
and
said
that
he
thought
quite
a
number
of
subscribers
would
have
done
the
same
as
i
have
already
said
he
continued
i
do
altogether
agree
in
the
methods
of
the
surgical
aid
society
their
cases
are
maintained
too
long
without
result
and
allows
too
good
an
opportunity
for
writing
begging
letters
not
even
now
could
i
see
the
drift
of
this
questions
that
he
suspected
me
of
being
an
impostor
of
writing
begging
letters
yes
i
who
was
bitter
at
having
to
bear
all
this
expense
and
was
grieved
at
having
to
withhold
two
shillings
a
week
from
one
who
was
very
poor
so
that
i
might
be
enabled
to
do
so
how
many
letters
do
you
now
need
he
asked
two
i
answered
but
i
do
intend
to
be
at
any
further
expense
in
postage
i
will
take
in
what
letters
i
have
already
received
and
explain
to
the
surgical
aid
society
the
difficulty
i
have
had
in
trying
to
obtain
the
requisite
number
this
ended
our
interview
and
i
went
away
satisfied
that
the
charity
organisation
would
come
to
my
rescue
in
the
near
future
but
i
did
not
again
hear
from
them
for
over
two
years
which
will
be
explained
in
another
chapter
how
they
answered
the
kind
lady
who
had
become
interested
in
me
i
can
not
say
but
it
could
not
have
been
other
than
to
my
discredit
the
day
following
this
interview
three
letters
were
at
the
office
all
three
coming
by
the
first
post
one
of
them
contained
a
subscription
letter
so
that
i
now
only
lacked
one
of
the
required
number
one
of
the
other
letters
came
from
the
surgical
aid
society
saying
that
a
subscriber
had
forwarded
to
them
a
letter
to
be
entered
to
my
account
and
that
if
i
would
call
at
their
office
with
the
letters
i
then
had
the
society
would
make
up
the
number
deficient
the
required
number
was
now
made
up
without
having
need
to
draw
on
the
society
i
now
took
these
letters
to
their
office
and
in
a
day
or
two
received
the
article
which
had
caused
me
so
much
bother
in
writing
letter
after
letter
and
such
an
expense
in
postage
by
a
sad
irony
the
worry
and
expense
was
by
no
means
at
an
end
as
i
had
expected
people
were
now
returning
from
the
continent
and
other
places
where
they
had
spent
their
summer
holidays
letters
came
to
me
daily
from
people
returning
home
some
of
my
own
letters
which
had
been
posted
three
four
five
and
six
weeks
before
were
now
being
considered
several
subscription
letters
came
to
hand
too
late
for
use
others
wrote
asking
if
i
was
still
in
need
of
assistance
i
was
now
at
as
great
an
expense
as
ever
returning
these
subscription
letters
with
thanks
and
writing
to
others
to
tell
them
that
i
had
now
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
required
number
letters
were
still
coming
when
i
left
the
ark
for
the
country
and
it
was
told
me
afterwards
that
a
goodly
number
had
come
been
kept
for
a
number
of
days
and
returned
during
my
absence
i
was
more
determined
than
ever
to
tramp
the
country
until
i
was
worth
thirty
pounds
for
an
offer
had
again
been
made
by
a
publisher
during
my
stay
at
the
ark
and
this
offer
was
much
the
same
as
the
other
seeing
that
there
was
no
other
way
of
getting
this
amount
than
by
hawking
the
country
i
determined
to
set
out
as
soon
as
possible
so
when
my
business
with
the
surgical
aid
society
was
at
an
end
i
spent
three
or
four
shillings
on
laces
needles
pins
buttons
and
started
with
a
light
heart
and
not
too
heavy
a
load
the
canadian
who
had
had
some
experience
in
this
kind
of
life
prophesied
good
results
from
it
adding
that
a
man
situated
the
same
way
as
i
was
need
carry
no
other
stock
in
trade
than
that
which
i
had
received
from
the
surgical
aid
society
and
that
success
was
assured
on
that
very
account
chapter
xxiii
gridling
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
in
september
when
i
left
the
ark
with
every
prospect
of
fulfilling
this
mission
as
i
advanced
towards
the
country
mile
after
mile
the
sounds
of
commerce
dying
low
and
the
human
face
becoming
more
rare
i
lost
for
the
time
being
my
vision
of
the
future
being
filled
with
the
peace
of
present
objects
i
noted
with
joy
the
first
green
field
after
the
park
the
first
bird
that
differed
from
the
sparrow
the
first
stile
in
the
hedge
after
the
carved
gate
and
the
first
footpath
across
the
wild
common
that
was
neither
of
gravel
nor
ash
i
had
something
like
nine
shillings
in
my
pocket
and
i
felt
that
business
was
out
of
the
question
as
long
as
any
of
this
remained
reaching
albans
on
the
first
night
i
walked
through
that
town
and
making
a
pillow
of
my
pack
lay
down
on
the
wild
common
it
seemed
as
though
extra
bodies
of
stars
had
been
drafted
that
night
into
the
heavens
to
guard
and
honour
the
coming
of
age
of
a
beautiful
moon
and
this
fine
scene
kept
me
awake
for
two
or
three
hours
in
spite
of
tired
limbs
this
seemed
to
me
a
glorious
life
as
long
as
summer
lasted
and
one
had
money
to
buy
food
in
towns
and
villages
through
which
he
passed
for
three
or
four
days
i
walked
and
idled
standing
on
culverts
and
watching
the
water
burst
from
darkness
into
light
listening
to
the
birds
or
looking
at
a
distant
spire
that
was
high
enough
and
no
more
to
show
that
a
quiet
town
was
lying
there
under
a
thousand
trees
i
reached
northampton
and
it
was
in
this
town
that
i
intended
to
start
business
on
the
following
day
though
i
still
had
a
few
shillings
left
having
slept
in
the
open
air
since
leaving
london
with
this
object
i
proceeded
to
examine
my
pack
with
the
intention
of
filling
my
pockets
with
the
different
wares
to
draw
them
forth
one
or
two
at
a
time
as
they
would
be
needed
so
that
night
previous
to
the
great
business
that
was
to
be
transacted
on
the
following
day
i
sought
a
quiet
corner
in
the
lodging
house
and
began
to
unroll
my
paper
parcel
as
i
proceeded
to
do
this
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
inner
part
of
the
parcel
was
damp
and
then
i
remembered
the
two
or
three
heavy
showers
that
we
had
on
the
second
day
of
my
travels
on
a
further
examination
i
discovered
to
my
horror
that
the
goods
were
entirely
unfit
for
sale
that
the
parcel
had
been
so
bent
and
misshapen
one
way
and
the
other
during
my
night
repose
that
the
needles
had
cut
through
their
rotten
packets
and
were
stuck
in
the
pin
papers
and
that
a
great
number
of
pins
had
concealed
their
whole
bodies
in
the
needle
packets
showing
plainly
the
guilty
tops
of
their
heads
the
laces
were
twisted
and
turned
and
their
tags
were
already
rusted
this
was
a
great
blow
to
me
as
there
seemed
nothing
else
to
do
but
send
home
for
the
few
shillings
that
had
now
become
due
but
on
second
thoughts
i
made
up
my
mind
to
travel
without
stock
of
any
kind
not
doubting
but
what
i
would
rise
to
the
emergency
after
the
last
penny
had
been
expended
and
i
was
under
the
force
of
necessity
thinking
northampton
too
large
a
town
in
which
to
starve
i
determined
to
remain
here
until
my
funds
were
exhausted
when
desperation
would
urge
me
to
action
with
this
idea
i
took
life
very
easily
for
a
couple
more
days
even
inviting
poverty
by
being
unusually
extravagant
going
to
the
extreme
of
buying
milk
for
my
tea
but
when
i
became
reduced
to
the
last
sixpence
i
decided
to
make
all
speed
to
birmingham
as
the
resources
of
that
city
it
being
so
much
larger
would
be
a
better
place
to
serve
my
wants
starting
on
this
journey
without
any
more
delay
i
was
soon
going
into
the
town
of
rugby
tired
penniless
and
hungry
what
was
i
to
do
something
had
to
be
done
and
that
at
once
i
had
to
face
the
horrible
truth
that
i
was
now
on
the
verge
of
starvation
whilst
busy
with
these
unpleasant
thoughts
i
heard
a
voice
shout
to
me
from
the
roadside
and
looking
in
that
direction
saw
a
man
sitting
in
the
grass
eating
from
a
paper
parcel
which
was
half
spread
before
him
on
going
over
to
see
what
this
man
wanted
i
found
an
apparently
tall
man
and
large
in
proportion
who
was
dressed
in
seedy
looking
clothes
which
were
torn
and
patched
in
a
good
many
places
in
fact
something
seemed
to
have
been
gnawing
night
after
night
at
the
bottom
of
his
trousers
taking
advantage
of
him
in
his
sleep
for
these
hung
in
tatters
and
rags
just
below
the
calves
of
his
legs
the
man
had
a
freckled
face
which
was
almost
lost
in
an
abundance
of
red
hair
and
his
head
was
as
thick
with
the
same
what
helped
to
make
his
appearance
strange
and
perhaps
ridiculous
was
a
schoolboy
small
cap
to
cover
the
crown
of
such
a
large
head
have
a
mouthful
of
this
he
said
inviting
me
to
partake
of
some
bread
and
meat
it
is
dry
eating
i
must
say
but
as
we
go
into
rugby
we
can
wash
it
down
with
a
pint
or
two
of
beer
i
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
accepting
his
invitation
seated
myself
on
the
grass
what
in
your
bundle
he
asked
looking
askance
at
a
small
brown
paper
parcel
which
contained
a
clean
shirt
socks
and
a
handkerchief
are
you
selling
anything
i
explained
to
him
that
i
was
a
licensed
hawker
but
had
not
yet
been
long
enough
at
the
business
to
make
a
success
of
it
what
he
cried
with
some
surprise
a
one
legged
man
not
to
be
successful
i
get
all
i
want
by
just
opening
of
my
mouth
although
he
added
with
some
scorn
i
know
that
some
people
can
not
beg
unless
they
have
something
in
their
hands
to
sell
but
if
you
travel
with
me
all
you
will
have
to
do
is
to
pick
up
the
coppers
after
i
had
finished
eating
he
proposed
to
set
off
immediately
and
as
we
walked
leisurely
along
i
wondered
how
it
was
possible
for
a
big
healthy
fellow
like
this
to
be
able
to
exist
in
any
other
manner
than
by
selling
on
coming
to
the
first
public
house
he
politely
invited
me
to
enter
which
i
did
when
he
called
for
two
pints
of
beer
he
then
became
communicative
telling
me
he
was
a
gridler
and
a
good
one
too
which
i
understood
to
mean
a
grinder
although
i
had
not
seen
tools
of
any
description
either
in
his
hands
or
in
his
pockets
he
paid
for
two
or
three
pints
of
beer
in
quick
succession
and
not
having
had
much
drink
for
a
considerable
time
i
began
to
feel
somewhat
elated
and
began
to
make
a
laughing
joke
of
my
circumstances
now
said
this
man
to
business
for
we
must
get
the
price
of
our
beds
and
a
little
breakfast
for
the
morning
not
to
mention
the
night
supper
all
you
have
to
do
he
said
again
is
to
pick
up
the
coppers
as
they
come
wondering
what
these
words
could
mean
i
followed
him
on
this
pleasant
afternoon
up
several
side
streets
until
we
came
to
the
end
of
one
very
long
street
which
had
respectable
looking
houses
on
either
side
of
the
road
my
strange
companion
walked
several
yards
down
this
street
and
then
came
to
a
sudden
halt
in
the
middle
of
the
road
now
said
he
for
the
third
or
fourth
time
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
pick
up
the
coppers
i
ask
you
to
do
no
more
except
he
added
grinning
rather
unpleasantly
except
to
see
that
we
are
not
picked
up
by
the
coppers
his
joke
appeared
simple
enough
and
i
could
not
fail
to
understand
it
but
it
was
not
at
all
to
my
relish
the
last
named
coppers
were
police
officers
who
would
be
likely
to
take
hold
of
us
for
illegally
appropriating
the
copper
coins
of
the
realm
are
you
going
to
pick
up
the
coppers
he
asked
a
little
impatiently
seeing
me
standing
irresolute
and
undecided
as
to
what
to
do
scarcely
knowing
how
to
answer
him
i
said
that
if
i
saw
any
coppers
he
need
have
no
fear
but
what
i
would
pick
them
up
all
right
that
good
he
said
at
the
same
time
moving
several
feet
away
from
me
i
stood
still
watching
these
mysterious
movements
and
thinking
of
the
coppers
wondering
from
what
source
they
would
be
supplied
he
now
turned
his
back
without
more
ado
and
setting
his
eyes
on
the
front
windows
before
him
began
to
my
amazement
to
sing
a
well
known
hymn
singing
it
in
the
most
horrible
and
lifeless
voice
i
have
ever
heard
in
spite
of
the
drink
which
had
now
taken
effect
making
my
head
swell
with
stupidity
i
still
felt
an
overwhelming
shame
at
finding
myself
in
this
position
i
stood
irresolute
not
knowing
whether
to
wait
the
result
of
this
or
to
leave
him
at
once
with
short
ceremony
but
whilst
ruminating
in
this
frame
of
mind
i
heard
a
window
open
with
a
loud
creak
saw
the
shaking
of
a
fair
hand
and
then
heard
a
copper
coin
fall
on
the
hard
earth
within
a
yard
of
where
i
stood
being
penniless
i
was
nothing
loth
to
take
possession
of
this
coin
and
had
scarcely
done
so
when
a
front
door
opened
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
a
fat
florid
old
gentleman
appeared
and
beckoned
me
across
to
him
going
immediately
to
this
gentleman
i
received
twopence
and
after
thanking
him
joined
my
companion
in
the
road
now
as
i
belong
to
a
race
of
people
that
are
ever
prone
to
song
whether
it
be
in
a
public
house
or
a
prayer
meeting
it
will
not
surprise
many
to
know
that
ere
long
i
was
making
strong
attempts
to
sing
bass
to
this
man
miserable
treble
and
only
ceased
to
do
so
when
it
became
necessary
to
stoop
and
pick
up
the
coppers
which
continued
to
come
in
at
the
rate
of
two
to
the
minute
the
effect
of
my
voice
on
my
companion
was
immediately
apparent
his
limbs
shook
his
knees
bent
and
knocked
together
and
his
voice
quivered
and
quavered
with
a
strong
emotion
he
was
now
singing
another
hymn
better
known
perhaps
than
the
last
and
what
with
his
tall
form
bent
double
to
half
its
height
and
the
wringing
of
his
hands
in
despair
a
poor
wretch
who
was
apparently
broken
both
in
body
and
spirit
he
was
at
this
particular
stage
the
most
miserable
looking
mortal
i
have
ever
beheld
he
was
in
this
old
man
broken
attitude
when
to
my
surprise
he
suddenly
straightened
his
great
body
and
gazed
about
one
second
down
the
street
after
which
he
quickly
turned
on
his
heels
saying
in
short
peremptory
tones
quick
march
at
the
same
time
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
in
sharp
military
steps
what
the
people
in
their
different
windows
and
on
their
doors
thought
of
this
change
i
can
not
say
i
looked
down
the
street
and
then
saw
that
a
police
officer
had
just
turned
its
far
corner
and
was
coming
slowly
in
our
direction
my
companion
waited
for
me
at
our
end
of
the
street
where
i
joined
him
as
soon
as
possible
it
is
getting
harder
every
day
for
a
poor
man
to
get
a
living
he
said
when
i
stood
beside
him
suppose
you
count
the
earnings
he
said
we
work
together
well
on
doing
this
i
found
twenty
pennies
to
be
in
my
possession
and
at
his
suggestion
we
there
and
then
shared
them
alike
friend
he
began
before
we
commence
again
let
me
give
you
a
word
or
two
of
advice
first
of
all
you
sing
in
too
lusty
a
voice
as
though
you
were
well
fed
and
in
good
health
secondly
you
are
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
to
move
on
and
would
get
out
of
people
hearing
before
they
have
time
to
be
affected
try
to
sing
in
a
weaker
voice
draw
out
the
easy
low
notes
to
a
greater
length
and
cut
the
difficult
high
notes
short
as
though
you
had
spasms
in
the
side
your
object
is
to
save
your
voice
as
much
as
possible
indifferent
to
the
demands
of
music
or
the
spirit
of
the
song
when
we
start
in
another
street
he
continued
but
at
this
admonitory
point
i
cut
him
short
telling
him
that
i
had
had
enough
of
eh
gridling
what
enough
of
chanting
he
cried
in
amaze
why
my
dear
fellow
it
is
the
best
thing
on
the
road
bar
none
all
right
he
said
seeing
my
determination
not
to
make
a
fresh
start
we
will
make
our
way
to
the
lodging
house
it
is
not
far
from
here
we
were
soon
comfortably
settled
in
this
place
and
when
after
having
had
a
good
tea
i
was
sitting
smoking
and
enjoying
a
newspaper
i
felt
more
pleased
than
ashamed
of
what
i
had
done
for
i
was
going
to
bed
with
an
easy
stomach
and
had
coppers
in
my
pocket
for
a
good
breakfast
therefore
when
a
fellow
lodger
a
hawker
who
was
now
taking
an
inventory
of
his
wares
and
who
had
probably
seen
and
heard
us
singing
that
day
when
following
his
own
calling
when
this
man
enquired
of
me
if
the
town
was
good
for
gridlers
i
answered
him
very
pleasantly
indeed
that
there
was
nothing
to
complain
of
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
my
companion
of
the
preceding
day
proposed
putting
in
a
good
eight
hours
work
but
i
at
once
cut
him
short
saying
that
such
a
business
was
not
in
my
line
now
several
women
were
at
this
place
some
of
them
were
married
and
some
single
and
most
of
them
made
and
sold
fancy
work
of
embroidery
after
i
had
spoken
so
decisively
to
my
companion
he
had
sat
near
to
one
of
these
women
at
the
other
end
of
the
kitchen
this
woman
who
seemed
to
be
the
wife
of
a
knife
and
scissors
grinder
had
a
little
girl
of
about
seven
years
of
age
yes
said
this
woman
in
answer
to
some
question
my
companion
had
made
you
can
have
the
kid
all
day
it
not
the
first
time
by
a
long
way
for
mary
ann
to
be
used
by
gridlers
and
she
knows
as
well
as
you
what
wanted
of
her
not
long
after
this
remark
my
companion
and
the
woman
child
left
the
kitchen
together
this
i
subsequently
often
saw
done
almost
any
woman
if
she
called
herself
a
true
traveller
would
lend
her
child
for
this
purpose
the
woman
or
child
of
course
deriving
some
part
of
the
profit
so
that
when
a
man
is
seen
with
one
or
more
children
it
is
not
always
to
be
granted
that
he
is
the
father
of
them
these
children
are
rarely
subjected
to
ill
usage
except
that
of
enforced
tramping
but
are
more
often
spoilt
by
indulgence
especially
if
they
show
early
signs
of
that
cunning
which
is
needed
for
their
future
and
which
is
the
boast
of
their
parents
what
a
merry
lot
of
beggars
were
assembled
here
and
how
busy
they
all
seemed
to
be
making
articles
for
sale
and
washing
and
mending
their
clothes
two
or
three
of
them
sitting
shirtless
during
the
process
of
drying
it
has
become
a
common
expression
to
say
dirty
tramp
or
as
dirty
as
a
tramp
but
this
is
not
always
true
except
occasionally
in
the
large
cities
although
such
a
term
may
be
applied
morally
to
them
all
there
is
one
species
of
tramp
who
wanders
from
workhouse
to
workhouse
and
this
man
having
every
night
to
conform
strictly
to
the
laws
of
cleanliness
is
no
less
clean
and
often
cleaner
than
a
number
of
people
whose
houses
contain
bath
rooms
which
they
seldom
use
another
species
of
tramp
is
proud
of
being
a
good
beggar
who
scorns
the
workhouse
but
who
knows
well
that
a
clean
appearance
is
essential
to
his
success
for
this
reason
any
one
that
enters
a
common
lodging
house
can
at
once
see
what
efforts
are
being
made
to
this
end
it
seems
strange
to
say
but
the
dirtiest
looking
tramp
is
often
the
most
honest
and
respectable
for
he
has
not
the
courage
to
beg
either
food
or
clothes
nor
will
he
enter
the
doors
of
a
workhouse
i
have
seen
this
so
often
the
case
that
i
would
much
prefer
to
believe
a
dirty
ragged
tramp
who
might
tell
me
that
he
had
a
good
home
six
months
previous
than
to
believe
his
cleaner
namesake
who
seems
so
eager
to
impart
this
information
unsolicited
it
is
certainly
the
man
who
has
had
a
good
home
and
has
been
waited
on
by
other
hands
who
soon
succumbs
to
a
filthy
condition
when
it
becomes
necessary
to
wait
on
himself
by
washing
and
patching
his
own
clothes
and
the
higher
his
former
position
has
been
the
lower
he
sinks
in
the
social
strata
it
is
no
difficult
matter
to
get
company
when
travelling
the
pedlar
whom
i
have
mentioned
before
asked
me
if
i
was
going
towards
coventry
and
if
i
intended
to
do
business
on
the
road
to
this
question
i
answered
that
such
might
be
the
case
but
i
could
not
say
for
sure
at
the
same
time
knowing
that
it
was
very
unlikely
come
along
then
he
said
and
do
business
if
you
feel
inclined
but
i
warn
you
it
is
a
very
poor
road
for
a
gridler
we
started
at
once
and
in
the
course
of
our
journey
i
told
him
everything
my
first
experience
of
gridling
and
my
dislike
to
it
and
how
my
wares
had
been
spoilt
by
the
rain
which
had
prevented
me
through
having
no
stock
nor
money
to
buy
it
from
earning
my
living
in
a
respectable
manner
as
a
pedlar
of
course
he
said
you
have
a
pedlar
certificate
i
answered
him
in
the
affirmative
and
added
that
i
had
not
earned
one
penny
with
it
up
to
that
moment
as
we
jogged
along
talking
in
this
way
we
came
to
a
small
village
when
the
pedlar
stopping
short
asked
if
i
would
like
to
help
him
to
do
a
little
trade
knowing
that
something
had
to
be
done
as
i
had
but
twopence
halfpenny
in
my
pocket
i
assured
him
that
i
would
hearing
this
he
took
two
bundles
of
laces
from
his
pack
leather
and
mohair
and
placed
them
in
my
hands
at
the
same
time
saying
you
work
on
one
side
of
the
village
and
i
attend
to
the
other
i
passed
several
houses
before
i
had
the
courage
to
knock
at
their
doors
but
seeing
him
go
calmly
from
door
to
door
i
nerved
myself
to
follow
his
example
and
was
soon
doing
the
same
and
as
far
as
i
could
see
was
meeting
with
more
success
this
so
encouraged
me
that
i
was
soon
regretting
that
i
had
no
more
houses
left
on
my
side
of
the
village
but
instead
of
waiting
patiently
until
he
had
done
i
took
a
desperate
notion
and
went
back
to
the
houses
which
i
had
at
first
passed
after
this
we
jogged
on
towards
coventry
which
we
reached
that
evening
we
worked
coventry
together
for
four
or
five
days
and
the
result
was
nine
shillings
and
some
odd
pence
in
my
pocket
this
pedlar
was
going
to
spend
a
week
or
two
with
a
brother
in
birmingham
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
a
number
of
years
but
before
we
left
coventry
he
persuaded
me
to
stock
myself
with
three
shillings
worth
of
stuff
and
said
he
never
let
a
day
pass
you
without
doing
some
business
however
little
and
never
allow
your
stock
to
get
low
we
reached
birmingham
and
after
he
had
shown
and
recommended
a
lodging
house
he
wished
me
with
many
hopes
that
we
might
meet
again
as
usual
my
first
enquiry
after
i
had
settled
for
my
lodgings
was
for
the
public
library
this
place
i
found
so
much
to
my
liking
what
with
its
variety
of
journals
its
number
of
papers
and
so
much
comfort
and
accommodation
for
its
visitors
that
business
was
entirely
out
of
the
question
until
the
third
day
when
i
woke
to
the
awkward
fact
that
my
last
three
coppers
were
then
being
spent
on
a
meal
at
this
i
made
up
my
mind
to
hawk
on
the
outskirts
of
birmingham
for
a
month
or
more
so
that
my
evenings
might
be
enjoyed
in
its
library
but
apparently
i
was
not
cut
out
for
this
kind
of
business
hawking
required
a
perseverance
which
i
certainly
did
not
possess
for
when
a
person
declined
to
make
a
purchase
instead
of
crying
up
the
cheapness
of
my
wares
i
walked
away
dumbfounded
to
the
next
house
yes
the
success
or
ill
success
of
this
buying
and
selling
was
all
a
simple
matter
of
tongue
a
big
fellow
with
a
persistent
tongue
can
talk
charity
out
of
the
people
who
indifferently
pass
the
silent
blind
man
of
course
this
business
of
hawking
with
a
few
cheap
laces
and
a
few
packets
of
common
pins
or
needles
was
after
all
only
another
name
for
begging
and
it
was
well
for
us
that
the
people
knew
it
for
they
often
paid
for
what
they
declined
to
receive
they
knew
that
these
things
were
to
be
had
much
cheaper
at
a
store
in
exoneration
of
this
fraudulent
selling
a
man
was
expected
to
tell
some
tale
of
distress
this
i
found
difficulty
in
doing
except
on
being
asked
direct
questions
and
the
people
would
often
stand
after
refusing
to
purchase
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
ready
to
assist
on
the
first
confession
of
distress
the
number
of
times
people
have
called
me
back
after
i
have
left
their
doors
and
assisted
me
has
often
proved
to
me
how
they
have
waited
to
have
their
first
feelings
of
pity
strengthened
by
some
recital
of
poverty
no
doubt
there
was
some
sort
of
a
living
to
be
made
in
this
way
providing
a
man
talked
incessantly
and
went
for
hours
from
house
to
house
and
from
street
to
street
and
when
he
failed
in
the
line
of
business
to
plead
for
the
sake
of
charity
it
must
have
been
over
two
hours
and
my
takings
had
amounted
to
ninepence
nearly
all
profit
i
admit
looking
at
this
paltry
amount
i
now
reversed
my
former
opinion
as
to
the
resources
of
a
large
city
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
small
country
towns
and
villages
were
after
all
more
willing
if
not
better
able
to
support
me
therefore
instead
of
returning
to
the
city
i
took
the
road
towards
warwick
intending
when
i
reached
that
town
to
use
my
tongue
to
some
purpose
and
how
many
houses
have
i
visited
with
this
same
resolution
but
alas
many
of
the
towns
were
passed
through
without
any
one
hearing
the
sound
of
my
voice
chapter
xxiv
on
the
downright
on
my
way
towards
warwick
i
joined
company
with
a
grinder
and
we
travelled
socially
together
towards
that
ancient
town
when
we
arrived
we
lost
no
time
in
seeking
a
lodging
house
which
we
soon
found
but
to
my
surprise
the
landlady
a
big
slatternly
woman
said
looking
sternly
at
my
companion
i
will
have
no
grinders
in
my
house
of
course
i
did
not
know
at
that
time
what
i
have
heard
subsequently
of
all
the
men
on
the
road
following
various
occupations
the
grinder
is
i
believe
the
most
thoroughly
detested
as
a
rule
he
is
a
drunken
dissolute
fellow
a
swearer
and
one
who
if
he
picks
up
a
quarrel
which
is
usually
the
case
is
in
no
hurry
to
drop
it
the
more
unpretentious
lodgers
hate
his
presence
seeing
that
he
makes
himself
more
at
home
than
the
landlord
himself
i
have
often
heard
travellers
tell
of
a
small
village
in
the
north
of
england
which
grinders
dare
not
enter
pass
through
or
lodge
therein
for
the
night
and
it
is
the
regret
of
many
travellers
that
there
are
not
more
villages
of
its
kind
distributed
throughout
the
country
it
seems
that
some
years
ago
a
great
wind
had
visited
that
particular
town
and
floored
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
grounded
the
church
steeple
many
of
the
inhabitants
being
injured
and
not
a
few
killed
now
it
happened
that
the
day
following
this
great
disaster
two
unfortunate
grinders
who
had
arrived
in
town
the
night
before
and
slept
at
the
village
inn
appeared
in
the
streets
and
made
a
great
shout
in
soliciting
orders
some
way
or
another
the
inhabitants
connected
these
poor
wretches
with
the
great
wind
and
set
upon
them
and
proceeded
to
beat
them
out
of
the
town
coming
near
to
killing
them
and
since
that
day
the
town
has
been
visited
by
neither
grinders
nor
great
winds
even
in
larger
towns
these
people
often
experience
great
difficulty
in
procuring
lodgings
this
state
of
affairs
was
not
known
to
me
at
this
time
or
i
should
certainly
not
have
been
anxious
for
the
company
of
one
of
these
despised
people
we
were
admitted
at
the
next
lodging
house
but
even
here
the
landlady
seemed
to
have
some
compunction
at
so
doing
for
she
followed
us
to
the
kitchen
and
without
saying
a
word
placed
her
two
hands
on
her
broad
hips
at
the
same
time
looking
severely
at
my
grinder
as
much
as
to
say
if
you
are
going
to
start
any
of
your
capers
let
it
be
at
once
my
hearty
grinder
now
i
am
watching
you
and
we
soon
see
who
who
we
sat
down
quietly
and
the
landlady
thinking
that
this
attitude
had
had
its
desired
effect
left
the
kitchen
not
forgetting
to
throw
a
last
glance
at
my
grinder
who
was
trying
his
best
to
hide
his
nervousness
by
puffing
hard
at
his
pipe
and
nearly
choking
in
the
attempt
some
ten
or
fifteen
men
were
in
this
room
some
of
them
busy
preparing
work
for
the
next
day
two
were
busy
making
artificial
flowers
one
was
working
with
copper
wire
turning
and
twisting
it
into
toasting
forks
plate
holders
and
hangers
to
suspend
flower
pots
two
others
were
in
the
rag
and
bone
trade
for
i
had
seen
them
when
i
first
entered
overlooking
their
stuff
in
the
backyard
one
man
was
a
pedlar
for
there
was
his
pack
towards
which
he
often
turned
his
eyes
in
distrust
of
his
company
one
was
a
musician
for
there
sticking
out
of
the
top
pocket
of
his
coat
was
a
common
tin
whistle
there
said
i
to
myself
glancing
at
a
man
on
my
right
hand
here
is
the
only
respectable
working
man
among
them
all
this
man
had
on
a
clean
moleskin
pair
of
trousers
a
pilot
cloth
coat
and
on
his
neck
a
large
clean
white
muffler
grinder
asked
this
man
catching
my
eye
before
i
could
avoid
it
no
i
answered
a
pedlar
oh
said
he
i
did
notice
you
carrying
a
pack
when
you
came
in
alas
my
little
stock
could
easily
be
carried
in
my
pockets
no
i
answered
as
a
rule
i
do
carry
much
stock
i
should
think
you
would
he
said
glancing
at
my
leg
a
bible
ought
to
be
enough
for
you
and
a
good
living
too
now
it
happened
that
when
i
left
london
i
had
made
room
in
my
pockets
for
two
books
which
up
till
that
time
i
had
very
little
opportunity
of
reading
one
was
the
bible
and
the
other
was
a
small
printed
and
cheap
paper
cover
edition
of
wordsworth
so
hearing
this
man
mention
a
bible
i
became
extremely
curious
to
learn
how
a
man
could
earn
a
living
by
carrying
a
book
of
this
kind
seeking
this
information
i
said
to
this
man
i
should
think
that
there
was
much
money
to
be
made
by
carrying
a
bible
why
not
he
asked
if
you
carry
in
your
hand
a
decent
rake
a
comb
a
flashy
pair
of
sniffs
scissors
and
a
card
of
good
links
and
studs
that
is
certainly
a
good
bible
for
a
living
but
there
is
not
much
profit
in
a
pair
of
stretchers
laces
or
a
packet
of
common
sharps
needles
as
for
me
he
continued
i
am
on
the
downright
and
i
go
in
for
straight
begging
without
showing
anything
in
my
hand
that
grinder
whom
i
thought
you
were
with
and
am
glad
you
are
not
works
very
hard
at
dragging
that
old
ricketty
contrivance
with
him
all
over
the
country
and
is
he
any
better
off
than
i
am
i
never
fail
to
get
the
sixteen
farthings
for
my
feather
bed
i
get
all
the
scrand
food
i
can
eat
and
i
seldom
lie
down
at
night
but
what
i
am
half
skimished
half
drunk
for
i
assure
you
i
never
go
short
of
my
skimish
being
curious
to
see
this
man
at
work
and
to
hear
the
tales
with
which
he
approached
people
i
told
him
i
would
accompany
him
the
next
day
as
far
as
stratford
that
was
if
he
had
no
objection
to
my
company
as
i
also
intended
to
visit
that
town
before
i
made
my
way
towards
london
to
this
proposal
he
seemed
perfectly
agreeable
the
next
morning
arrived
and
after
having
had
breakfast
we
set
out
we
had
scarcely
set
foot
outside
the
lodging
house
when
i
saw
this
downrighter
dodge
in
and
out
of
shops
with
an
astonishing
alacrity
more
like
a
customer
than
a
beggar
but
with
what
success
i
could
not
tell
he
seemed
to
go
in
smiling
and
to
come
out
the
same
until
we
were
at
last
at
the
business
end
of
the
town
he
did
not
confide
in
me
as
to
his
success
or
failure
but
generously
invited
me
to
a
smoke
we
filled
our
pipes
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
strike
a
match
my
companion
interrupted
me
with
wait
until
we
are
on
the
other
side
of
the
sky
pilot
looking
down
the
road
i
saw
a
clergyman
approaching
us
at
a
fast
rate
carrying
something
in
his
hand
which
proved
on
nearer
view
to
be
a
book
of
prayers
when
this
black
cloth
was
within
three
or
four
feet
of
us
my
companion
began
to
address
him
in
a
very
serious
voice
calling
him
in
his
ignorance
or
perhaps
excitement
your
reverend
highness
the
gentleman
in
black
cloth
seemed
to
have
been
expecting
something
of
this
kind
for
without
turning
his
head
either
to
the
right
or
left
he
passed
on
going
if
possible
at
a
greater
speed
on
seeing
which
my
companion
shouted
in
a
jeering
voice
go
it
old
hearty
and
remember
me
in
yer
prayers
as
we
proceeded
on
our
way
he
laughed
immoderately
yes
he
said
i
have
always
found
a
bible
or
a
prayer
book
in
a
person
hand
to
be
the
sign
of
an
uncharitable
disposition
seldom
do
i
get
anything
from
them
but
i
like
to
pester
them
now
if
this
had
been
a
man
with
a
bottle
or
jug
of
beer
in
his
hand
i
would
have
had
a
civil
answer
at
the
very
least
the
indifference
of
this
reverend
gentleman
and
the
experience
my
companion
seemed
to
have
had
of
this
kind
in
general
surprised
me
not
a
little
for
this
man
i
was
with
certainly
had
the
appearance
of
an
honest
working
man
of
the
better
class
his
clothes
were
good
and
his
flesh
was
clean
and
he
certainly
had
not
forgotten
the
barber
my
companion
allowed
no
person
to
pass
us
without
making
an
appeal
and
it
was
made
apparent
to
me
that
he
was
successful
in
a
number
of
cases
in
times
of
failure
people
listened
to
this
respectable
looking
fellow
and
regretted
that
they
had
left
home
without
having
brought
coppers
with
them
at
one
time
we
saw
a
man
who
had
dismounted
to
examine
his
bicycle
probably
having
heard
some
part
of
it
go
click
and
fearing
an
accident
had
paused
for
an
investigation
we
stood
before
this
man
and
my
companion
in
straightforward
manly
tones
asked
him
for
assistance
the
gentleman
began
to
stammer
to
hem
and
to
haw
at
the
same
time
saying
that
he
regretted
that
he
was
not
at
that
moment
exactly
in
the
position
to
friend
broke
in
my
bold
downrighter
in
a
stern
solemn
voice
laying
his
heavy
hand
on
the
man
shoulder
friend
you
see
before
you
two
men
in
extreme
want
who
must
be
relieved
in
this
very
hour
we
were
standing
in
the
way
and
he
could
not
possibly
escape
without
knocking
us
over
apparently
the
man
was
afraid
for
he
first
looked
at
our
faces
and
after
looking
backward
and
then
forward
he
produced
a
silver
sixpence
saying
he
trusted
that
that
amount
would
be
of
some
service
to
us
we
made
sure
of
this
and
then
cleared
ourselves
from
his
path
allowing
him
space
to
mount
and
ride
an
opportunity
of
which
he
quickly
availed
himself
this
looked
very
much
like
highway
robbery
but
strangely
i
was
better
satisfied
at
this
open
independent
way
of
transacting
business
than
by
whining
forth
pitiful
tales
of
want
however
true
they
might
be
we
were
now
entering
the
town
of
and
my
companion
was
advising
me
as
to
my
behaviour
at
the
common
lodging
house
it
is
the
only
lodging
house
in
the
town
he
said
and
the
old
lady
is
very
particular
and
eccentric
our
very
appearance
may
dissatisfy
her
and
then
we
will
be
compelled
to
walk
some
miles
to
the
next
town
she
keeps
a
shop
attached
to
the
lodging
house
continued
the
downrighter
and
if
strangers
not
knowing
this
to
be
the
case
when
applying
for
lodgings
have
bread
tea
sugar
meat
in
their
hands
that
is
bought
elsewhere
this
eccentric
old
landlady
declines
to
receive
them
as
lodgers
and
they
are
forced
often
late
at
night
to
walk
to
the
next
town
some
time
ago
he
continued
a
lodger
bought
at
her
shop
a
half
pound
of
cornbeef
which
he
thought
was
underweight
going
to
the
public
house
opposite
for
a
glass
of
beer
he
requested
the
publican
to
weigh
this
meat
which
being
done
it
was
found
to
be
two
ounces
short
of
the
required
weight
on
returning
to
the
house
this
lodger
went
quietly
to
bed
but
the
next
morning
he
spoke
his
mind
to
her
in
a
very
straightforward
manner
making
mention
of
the
publican
as
a
witness
ever
since
that
time
any
man
who
visits
that
public
house
is
not
allowed
to
sleep
on
her
premises
if
seen
entering
that
place
by
day
they
are
objected
to
at
night
and
if
seen
visiting
that
house
after
their
beds
are
already
paid
for
on
their
return
their
money
is
at
once
refunded
without
the
least
explanation
it
certainly
spoke
highly
for
our
respectable
appearance
when
this
particular
landlady
received
our
money
and
admitted
us
without
much
scrutiny
into
the
kitchen
although
she
lost
no
time
in
following
us
there
and
stood
for
several
minutes
watching
our
movements
no
doubt
if
one
of
us
had
thrown
a
match
on
the
floor
or
sat
too
near
the
fire
or
complained
that
the
kitchen
only
contained
two
tea
pots
cracked
and
half
spoutless
among
the
ten
lodgers
now
patiently
waiting
a
chance
to
make
tea
and
that
there
were
only
three
cups
and
one
half
rimmed
plate
like
a
vanishing
moon
no
doubt
if
we
had
uttered
one
complaint
our
money
would
have
been
returned
without
advice
or
warning
and
we
would
have
found
no
other
lodgings
that
would
have
answered
our
small
means
in
the
town
but
we
fortunately
knew
the
old
lady
too
well
to
implicate
ourselves
and
we
gave
her
no
chance
to
complain
after
tea
i
wandered
alone
about
the
town
and
as
i
went
here
and
there
in
this
enchanted
place
ambition
again
took
possession
of
me
stronger
than
ever
it
filled
me
with
vexation
to
think
that
i
was
no
nearer
my
object
for
i
was
comparatively
speaking
penniless
two
months
had
i
wandered
during
which
time
i
had
not
been
able
to
concentrate
my
thoughts
on
any
noble
theme
taking
all
day
to
procure
the
price
of
a
bed
and
two
or
three
coppers
extra
for
food
true
i
had
by
now
some
three
pounds
saved
the
income
that
i
had
not
touched
but
at
this
rate
i
would
never
be
able
to
attain
my
ends
november
was
here
and
i
was
suddenly
confronted
with
a
long
winter
before
me
and
i
pictured
myself
starved
and
snow
bound
in
small
out
of
the
way
villages
or
mercilessly
pelted
by
hailstones
on
a
wild
shelterless
heath
side
by
side
with
these
scenes
i
placed
my
ideal
which
was
a
small
room
with
a
cosy
fire
in
which
i
sat
surrounded
by
books
and
i
sickened
at
the
comparison
the
following
morning
i
was
up
and
on
my
way
before
the
downrighter
had
put
in
an
appearance
in
two
or
three
days
i
was
again
back
on
the
outskirts
of
london
walking
it
round
in
a
circle
sometimes
ten
miles
from
its
mighty
heart
or
as
far
distant
as
twenty
miles
but
without
the
courage
to
approach
nearer
or
to
break
away
from
it
altogether
whatever
luck
i
had
good
or
bad
i
always
managed
to
escape
the
workhouse
and
was
determined
to
walk
all
night
if
needs
be
rather
than
seek
refuge
in
one
of
those
places
one
desperate
hour
possessed
me
every
day
sometimes
in
the
morning
or
in
the
afternoon
but
more
often
in
the
evening
when
i
would
waylay
people
on
the
high
roads
go
boldly
to
the
front
doors
of
houses
interview
men
in
their
gardens
stables
or
shops
at
the
same
time
flourishing
before
their
eyes
a
whip
of
a
dozen
laces
in
this
hour
i
seemed
to
be
impelled
by
a
fatality
like
that
of
the
wandering
jew
cursed
at
having
to
perform
something
against
my
will
when
this
mad
fit
was
at
an
end
during
which
i
generally
succeeded
in
getting
a
shilling
or
more
people
might
then
come
and
go
without
fear
of
being
molested
for
i
was
satisfied
that
the
workhouse
was
once
more
defeated
for
another
night
one
morning
at
the
beginning
of
december
i
made
up
my
mind
to
tramp
home
for
christmas
this
was
a
new
idea
and
not
much
to
my
liking
for
i
had
always
written
them
hopeful
letters
and
although
they
knew
that
i
had
left
london
they
knew
nothing
of
my
present
condition
as
usual
under
these
active
impulses
i
made
astonishing
progress
being
on
the
borders
of
wales
in
less
than
a
week
the
greater
part
of
the
journey
accomplished
being
now
less
than
thirty
miles
from
my
native
town
i
regretted
having
started
with
such
an
intention
and
tramped
over
the
welsh
hills
day
after
day
ultimately
finding
my
way
to
swansea
i
did
not
remain
long
in
that
town
but
began
other
rambles
and
the
day
before
christmas
eve
was
in
a
town
miles
from
home
sleeping
there
that
night
i
rose
early
the
following
morning
and
started
for
home
keeping
up
a
pace
of
three
miles
an
hour
in
spite
of
the
one
leg
and
the
rough
uneven
roads
of
the
hills
i
accomplished
the
journey
in
nine
hours
arriving
home
just
after
dark
without
having
once
rested
on
the
way
i
had
now
been
tramping
for
over
three
months
and
thought
myself
entitled
to
a
little
rest
if
such
could
be
had
after
all
why
had
i
done
this
and
to
what
end
had
i
suffered
for
i
would
now
draw
the
few
pounds
that
were
due
to
me
would
return
to
london
in
a
week
or
two
and
would
again
commence
writing
without
any
prospect
of
success
for
i
would
once
more
be
living
on
a
small
income
and
such
was
the
case
three
weeks
comfort
improved
me
wonderfully
and
vitality
returned
stronger
than
ever
after
the
low
state
into
which
it
had
fallen
what
cut
me
to
the
heart
was
not
so
much
that
i
had
not
practised
writing
during
these
four
months
but
that
i
had
been
forced
to
neglect
reading
and
had
therefore
been
taking
in
no
means
to
justify
my
hopes
in
the
future
of
being
capable
of
writing
something
of
my
own
the
poor
man
who
has
his
daily
duties
to
perform
has
his
quiet
evenings
at
home
with
friends
to
lend
him
books
and
being
known
in
the
locality
a
library
from
which
to
borrow
them
but
what
privileges
has
the
wanderer
feeling
myself
fit
i
drew
what
money
was
due
to
me
and
returned
to
london
chapter
xxv
the
farmhouse
yes
i
returned
to
london
and
to
my
surprise
began
to
look
forward
with
pleasure
to
be
again
frequenting
the
old
haunts
for
which
when
leaving
i
had
felt
so
much
disgust
this
feeling
seems
to
be
natural
that
i
felt
inclined
to
see
familiar
faces
although
they
were
red
and
blotchy
with
drink
to
hear
familiar
voices
however
foul
their
language
might
be
therefore
on
the
first
night
of
my
return
wonder
not
when
i
say
that
i
was
sitting
comfortably
in
the
ark
as
though
i
had
not
slept
one
night
away
i
looked
in
vain
for
my
old
friend
the
canadian
many
recognised
and
spoke
to
me
one
in
particular
a
toy
seller
who
was
curious
to
know
where
i
had
been
seeing
that
he
suspected
that
i
had
been
incarcerated
in
a
jail
i
told
him
something
of
my
wanderings
and
ended
by
making
enquiries
of
him
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
canadian
of
this
man
he
knew
nothing
but
gave
information
that
cronje
the
fish
porter
another
of
my
acquaintances
was
staying
at
the
farmhouse
and
no
doubt
would
be
glad
to
see
me
he
having
been
at
the
ark
to
enquire
of
me
during
my
absence
of
course
it
was
not
my
intention
to
stay
long
at
the
ark
so
i
at
once
made
my
way
to
the
farmhouse
to
see
cronje
where
i
found
him
the
farmhouse
is
very
particular
about
taking
in
strangers
which
certainly
makes
it
a
more
desirable
place
than
others
of
its
kind
but
at
cronje
recommendation
i
was
without
much
ceremony
accepted
as
a
lodger
this
man
nicknamed
cronje
who
had
been
for
a
number
of
years
in
australia
and
had
so
many
wonderful
anecdotes
to
relate
was
a
sharp
little
man
the
very
image
of
a
jew
in
features
but
fair
red
always
happy
and
laughing
for
a
contradiction
he
was
clean
in
his
habits
extremely
generous
to
the
poorer
lodgers
and
was
well
liked
by
all
it
is
true
that
many
considered
him
to
be
a
liar
but
no
man
contradicted
him
for
no
man
was
capable
of
talking
him
down
in
his
early
days
he
had
had
a
phenomenal
voice
which
he
claimed
to
have
lost
through
auctioneering
as
a
rower
he
had
defeated
all
comers
on
the
river
murrumbidgee
and
had
publicly
disgraced
the
champion
of
wagga
wagga
at
billiards
on
seeing
a
man
taking
a
hair
out
of
his
food
cronje
declaimed
on
the
danger
of
swallowing
this
relating
how
his
friend
skinner
of
australia
who
had
taken
down
all
the
best
fencers
of
europe
had
swallowed
a
single
hair
which
taking
root
in
his
stomach
had
grown
to
such
a
length
that
it
had
killed
him
before
an
operation
could
be
performed
again
hearing
some
one
mention
the
names
of
two
famous
singers
one
a
tenor
and
the
other
basso
cronje
eager
to
create
wonder
said
that
it
was
a
most
remarkable
case
that
the
tenor
had
at
first
become
famous
as
a
basso
and
that
the
basso
had
at
first
received
recognition
as
a
tenor
and
that
each
man
voice
had
changed
after
he
had
become
famous
what
a
strange
house
was
this
so
full
of
quaint
characters
some
of
these
men
had
been
here
for
fifteen
and
twenty
years
haymaker
george
was
here
and
had
been
here
for
some
time
for
he
claimed
to
have
gone
haymaking
from
this
very
house
when
he
first
came
here
going
and
returning
daily
without
the
assistance
of
trains
busses
or
cars
salvation
jimmy
was
here
who
had
been
so
emotional
that
he
had
been
desired
as
an
acquisition
to
the
salvation
army
which
he
had
joined
and
donned
the
red
jersey
at
last
the
poor
fellow
had
become
so
very
emotional
probably
influenced
by
such
stirring
music
and
the
ready
hallelujah
of
the
members
that
really
his
frequent
laughter
his
fervent
cries
and
his
had
provoked
so
many
smiles
and
sarcastic
remarks
from
his
audience
that
not
only
was
he
not
promoted
to
rank
from
a
private
but
was
discharged
the
service
altogether
even
to
this
day
he
knew
no
reason
for
his
dismissal
he
was
mad
enough
now
in
these
later
days
laughing
dancing
and
singing
up
and
down
the
farmhouse
kitchen
so
that
i
can
imagine
the
effect
on
his
nerves
when
marching
to
the
sound
of
loud
music
under
the
spread
of
a
blood
red
banner
even
now
in
these
days
he
drew
every
one
attention
to
his
eccentric
behaviour
so
that
what
must
he
have
been
then
i
soon
knew
them
all
by
name
that
is
by
their
nicknames
by
which
most
of
them
preferred
to
be
known
it
was
very
interesting
to
hear
morning
after
morning
fishy
fat
and
john
the
latter
being
in
the
last
stages
of
consumption
and
poor
fellow
peevish
withal
sit
down
to
breakfast
and
to
abolish
the
house
of
lords
it
was
often
a
surprise
to
me
to
see
this
noble
edifice
still
standing
after
hearing
it
abolished
in
such
fierce
language
and
in
terms
of
such
scathing
reproach
strangely
these
men
had
very
little
to
say
during
the
day
and
did
one
get
up
earlier
than
the
other
in
the
morning
he
would
stand
silent
with
his
back
to
the
fire
or
pace
quietly
up
and
down
the
kitchen
waiting
the
appearance
of
his
friend
when
one
saw
the
other
preparing
breakfast
he
would
at
once
follow
his
example
and
when
everything
was
ready
both
would
seat
themselves
opposite
each
other
at
the
same
table
up
till
this
time
nothing
would
have
been
said
until
each
had
tasted
and
sugared
his
tea
to
his
own
liking
after
this
being
done
one
would
suddenly
ejaculate
a
sentence
of
this
kind
smother
them
lazy
rotters
in
the
the
bleeding
liars
in
accordance
with
that
remark
the
other
would
immediately
answer
perish
all
and
then
would
follow
oath
after
oath
of
the
blackest
character
and
daring
designs
that
would
have
gladdened
the
heart
of
guy
fawkes
brown
was
also
here
and
always
in
a
state
of
wonder
he
had
very
little
faith
in
print
and
every
hour
things
happened
which
made
him
to
use
his
own
words
know
not
what
or
what
not
to
believe
he
presumed
that
the
laity
was
a
certain
kind
of
religious
sect
but
to
him
they
all
seemed
without
difference
the
only
difference
he
could
see
between
a
vicar
and
a
curate
was
that
one
had
a
larger
corporation
and
a
redder
nose
than
the
other
brown
who
was
a
simple
fellow
said
that
we
were
all
born
of
woman
that
we
were
born
and
that
we
must
all
die
that
it
was
a
great
pity
and
made
his
heart
bleed
to
see
a
man
come
down
in
life
after
he
has
been
high
up
and
that
we
had
to
face
a
cruel
fact
although
it
was
almost
beyond
belief
that
a
man
own
relations
often
caused
the
man
downfall
which
with
his
own
eyes
he
had
seen
done
gambling
fred
was
here
looking
over
the
daily
paper
with
red
nosed
scotty
they
are
both
short
sighted
and
unfortunately
have
but
one
pair
of
spectacles
between
them
which
is
now
being
used
by
scotty
suddenly
the
red
nosed
man
sees
the
name
of
a
horse
there
you
are
he
cries
exultingly
there
a
sure
winner
where
asks
his
fellow
gambler
taking
the
spectacles
and
adjusting
them
on
his
own
nose
how
can
i
show
you
now
asks
the
red
nosed
gambler
in
a
fretful
voice
have
you
got
the
specs
on
at
last
matters
are
arranged
to
the
satisfaction
of
both
and
fred
approaches
his
friend
yanks
for
the
loan
of
sixpence
to
back
this
horse
but
yanks
unceremoniously
tells
his
friend
to
go
to
hell
at
this
the
gambler
sulks
all
the
evening
and
unfortunately
the
next
day
his
favoured
horse
wins
on
this
transaction
the
gambler
would
have
been
ten
shillings
in
pocket
after
this
another
horse
won
which
fred
in
his
penniless
state
professes
to
have
favoured
he
would
have
backed
this
horse
with
his
ten
shillings
won
from
the
other
race
and
would
now
have
been
five
pounds
in
pocket
yes
says
the
gambler
pointing
to
his
friend
yanks
that
man
has
done
me
out
of
many
a
golden
pound
poor
old
scotty
bill
was
here
a
seller
of
fly
papers
who
disturbed
the
kitchen
all
day
because
of
the
scarcity
of
flies
as
though
the
lodgers
were
to
blame
we
are
having
damn
strange
summers
of
late
years
he
said
different
from
my
younger
days
for
there
is
now
scarcely
a
fly
to
be
seen
here
dwelt
hoppy
the
bootblack
who
had
a
rival
in
business
on
the
opposite
corner
he
was
certainly
the
dirtiest
man
i
have
ever
seen
going
in
and
out
of
a
house
but
he
earned
good
money
and
often
came
home
drunk
to
this
lodging
house
in
a
cab
causing
a
great
sensation
among
the
poorer
lodgers
his
rival
did
less
trade
and
could
afford
to
do
less
a
lodger
remarked
seeing
that
his
mother
kept
a
flourishing
cats
meat
shop
when
i
have
passed
near
these
rival
bootblacks
i
have
often
wondered
how
the
thousands
of
people
walked
daily
between
them
without
being
singed
not
to
mention
scorched
by
their
baneful
glances
which
were
fired
at
each
other
across
the
way
here
too
had
irish
tim
come
a
very
small
man
with
a
sarcastic
tongue
an
printer
broken
on
the
wheels
of
new
machinery
did
you
not
want
to
be
subjected
to
the
ridicule
of
the
kitchen
it
was
necessary
when
expressing
an
opinion
to
look
this
man
straight
and
sternly
in
the
face
and
to
speak
with
the
utmost
deliberation
he
always
sat
at
the
same
table
and
in
the
same
seat
if
not
already
occupied
and
his
particular
table
was
known
as
the
house
of
parliament
owing
to
the
number
of
arguments
conducted
there
of
which
he
was
the
leader
he
passed
judgment
on
public
men
and
although
he
rarely
had
a
good
word
for
any
one
i
must
say
to
tim
credit
that
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
stroke
the
cat
i
believe
tim
had
just
a
little
friendly
feeling
for
simple
eccentric
and
impulsive
bob
whom
he
could
scorn
and
contradict
without
being
threatened
or
bullied
in
return
bob
was
an
idealist
a
dreamer
with
a
strong
imagination
and
it
was
tim
delight
to
beat
this
dreamer
to
the
thorny
paths
of
his
daily
life
speaking
in
the
name
of
common
sense
bob
was
full
of
the
wonders
of
nature
marvelled
much
at
the
undertakings
of
men
to
make
railways
to
cross
mountains
and
bridges
to
span
canyons
and
was
deeply
interested
in
the
early
growth
of
things
ere
they
were
manufactured
into
a
form
that
every
person
could
recognise
he
was
a
most
brilliant
conversationalist
and
was
interestingly
dramatic
in
his
readings
he
was
a
good
companion
for
others
but
as
i
soon
discovered
to
my
disappointment
seldom
had
a
comfortable
moment
when
alone
with
himself
i
had
a
small
bedroom
to
myself
and
unfortunately
the
near
cubicle
to
mine
was
bob
bob
who
probably
five
minutes
before
had
been
in
the
kitchen
laughing
or
reading
with
childish
delight
of
the
gorgeous
pageantry
of
a
coming
play
or
pantomime
or
had
been
seriously
wondering
at
some
new
discovery
would
scarcely
set
foot
in
his
own
quiet
room
ere
he
was
clutched
by
a
devil
i
have
become
accustomed
to
foul
language
from
one
man
to
another
but
his
bold
way
of
directly
addressing
his
blasphemy
to
his
maker
stiffened
the
laughter
on
my
lips
and
shocked
me
in
spite
of
an
indifferent
faith
this
unusually
clever
man
a
genius
if
this
world
ever
had
one
disappointed
at
his
circumstances
after
an
indulgence
of
his
ideal
would
sit
on
his
bed
and
try
to
throttle
himself
night
after
night
and
then
would
smother
his
face
in
his
bed
clothes
and
invariably
end
his
mad
fit
by
sobbing
when
he
reached
this
pitiful
state
this
simple
impulsive
and
childlike
man
i
felt
like
standing
to
his
side
before
the
outraged
face
of
his
maker
so
great
was
my
pity
for
him
many
others
were
here
whom
i
was
to
become
better
acquainted
with
such
as
the
major
australian
bill
never
sweet
cinders
and
the
snob
who
was
sent
to
prison
so
often
through
having
an
for
other
people
pockets
and
who
when
questioned
as
to
his
absence
always
said
he
had
been
to
see
his
youngest
brother
all
of
these
were
here
with
many
others
of
note
for
the
blacksmith
was
here
who
every
time
he
saw
me
preparing
to
go
out
thought
i
must
be
on
a
begging
expedition
and
he
trusted
that
i
would
find
the
ladies
kindly
disposed
on
thanking
him
for
this
kind
wish
he
confided
his
intention
of
visiting
deptford
saying
that
he
had
given
that
part
of
the
city
a
long
rest
boozy
bob
was
here
drunken
dave
and
brummy
tom
three
small
men
with
a
large
capacity
for
taking
ale
all
these
men
were
quiet
or
at
least
not
objectionable
and
none
of
them
could
disturb
me
in
my
room
the
sleep
of
the
house
was
disturbed
more
from
without
than
from
any
cause
within
cats
by
day
the
most
docile
of
god
creatures
every
one
of
them
in
the
night
enlisting
under
the
devil
banner
took
the
place
by
storm
after
the
human
voice
had
ceased
but
perhaps
the
one
who
accounted
for
more
than
of
my
sleepless
nights
was
a
woman
an
outsider
living
in
an
adjacent
block
it
was
her
custom
to
come
home
drunk
early
in
the
morning
singing
and
swearing
little
punch
a
sickly
consumptive
who
had
lived
in
this
neighbourhood
of
southwark
all
his
life
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
the
voice
of
kelly
so
whenever
i
enquired
as
to
the
origin
of
a
disturbance
the
name
of
kelly
was
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
it
kelly
was
not
satisfied
with
a
single
fight
she
occasionally
instigated
a
riot
on
the
night
of
that
memorable
day
when
southwark
and
in
particular
the
borough
was
visited
by
royalty
this
was
the
lady
that
murdered
sleep
the
police
always
appeared
tolerant
with
her
and
more
so
on
this
occasion
as
a
general
rule
it
is
people
that
live
in
private
houses
who
have
to
complain
of
the
presence
of
a
common
lodging
house
of
being
disturbed
by
its
inmates
but
this
lodging
house
with
beds
for
nearly
two
hundred
men
was
kept
as
quiet
as
a
large
mansion
with
its
one
small
family
and
half
a
score
of
servants
in
its
kitchen
was
a
continual
din
up
till
twelve
at
night
but
this
did
not
disturb
the
sleepers
in
other
parts
of
the
house
seldom
would
a
loud
voice
be
heard
inside
but
it
was
nothing
unusual
to
hear
at
night
the
fighting
and
swearing
of
men
and
women
and
the
screaming
of
children
this
could
be
expected
without
fail
on
saturday
nights
and
the
close
of
holidays
these
horrible
and
inhuman
cries
so
affected
me
on
one
saturday
evening
when
for
the
sake
of
the
study
i
had
retired
early
to
bed
that
i
could
neither
think
sleep
nor
lie
quiet
and
felt
compelled
to
get
up
and
return
to
the
kitchen
this
i
did
and
found
thirty
or
forty
men
assembled
there
most
of
them
more
or
less
drunk
but
none
of
them
appeared
quarrelsome
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
sit
long
here
before
i
was
surrounded
by
them
and
sat
fearing
to
breathe
deep
enough
to
inhale
the
fumes
of
drink
which
came
from
both
their
mouths
and
clothes
and
being
in
good
favour
with
these
hopeless
fellows
was
continually
invited
good
naturedly
to
shake
hands
with
them
instead
of
going
back
to
my
room
i
left
the
place
and
entered
a
public
house
for
the
first
time
in
three
months
brummy
tom
was
there
with
another
fish
porter
of
his
acquaintance
have
a
drink
with
me
he
said
i
have
often
thought
to
ask
you
but
thought
you
were
a
teetotaller
and
would
refuse
i
said
rather
bitterly
a
teetotaller
who
lives
in
a
common
lodging
house
is
to
be
heartily
despised
for
he
shows
himself
to
be
satisfied
with
his
conditions
with
brummy
tom
and
his
friend
for
companions
i
took
a
number
of
long
sleeping
draughts
and
just
after
twelve
that
night
was
fast
asleep
in
bed
the
following
morning
some
of
the
lodgers
were
telling
of
murder
cries
heard
just
after
midnight
but
i
praised
the
power
of
bacchus
that
i
had
not
heard
them
it
was
always
a
mystery
to
me
that
these
men
respected
me
and
never
failed
in
civility
in
their
dealings
with
me
for
i
did
everything
that
these
men
disliked
i
wore
a
white
collar
which
they
at
once
take
to
be
a
challenge
that
you
are
their
superior
few
other
men
in
the
house
except
they
were
fighting
men
could
have
produced
a
toothbrush
without
being
sneered
at
true
it
induced
brown
to
ask
the
question
whether
i
felt
any
actual
benefit
from
cleaning
my
teeth
that
he
had
heard
so
many
different
opinions
that
he
did
not
know
what
or
what
not
to
believe
saying
that
he
had
often
watched
me
and
wondered
at
so
unusual
a
custom
they
all
detested
the
masher
because
he
was
earning
more
than
a
pound
a
week
on
a
good
paper
stand
and
was
also
in
receipt
of
a
good
pension
and
they
all
cried
shame
on
him
for
living
in
a
common
lodging
house
this
man
to
my
discomfort
showed
so
much
inclination
to
confide
in
me
pointing
out
the
different
lodgers
who
owed
him
money
and
calling
them
low
vagabonds
and
ungrateful
scamps
in
a
voice
that
was
not
meant
to
be
a
whisper
that
i
was
almost
afraid
of
losing
their
good
will
in
listening
to
such
words
without
saying
something
on
their
behalf
again
i
was
almost
a
teetotaller
and
that
was
the
worst
charge
of
all
in
spite
of
all
this
i
do
not
believe
that
i
made
one
enemy
and
am
certain
that
i
never
received
other
than
kindness
and
civility
from
the
lodgers
of
the
farmhouse
chapter
xxvi
rain
and
poverty
the
greatest
enemy
to
the
man
who
has
to
carry
on
his
body
all
his
wardrobe
is
rain
as
long
as
the
sun
shines
he
is
indifferent
but
if
he
is
caught
in
a
wet
condition
after
sunset
he
is
to
be
pitied
he
does
not
fear
any
ill
consequences
to
health
from
being
wet
through
as
does
his
more
fortunate
brother
but
he
does
not
like
the
uncomfortable
sensation
of
shivering
and
not
being
able
to
keep
warm
this
unsettled
feeling
is
often
made
worse
by
an
empty
stomach
in
fact
a
full
stomach
is
his
one
safeguard
against
the
cold
and
he
cares
not
then
if
the
rain
and
the
wind
penetrate
his
clothes
no
seaman
ever
searched
the
heavens
for
a
dark
speck
or
astronomer
for
a
new
light
as
does
this
homeless
man
for
a
sign
of
rain
to
escape
from
the
coming
deluge
he
seeks
shelter
in
the
public
library
which
is
the
only
free
shelter
available
and
there
he
sits
for
hours
staring
at
one
page
not
a
word
of
which
he
has
read
or
for
that
matter
intends
to
read
if
he
can
not
at
once
get
a
seat
he
stands
before
a
paper
and
performs
that
almost
impossible
feat
of
standing
upright
fast
asleep
so
as
to
deceive
the
attendants
and
respectable
people
who
are
waiting
a
chance
to
see
that
very
paper
to
be
able
to
do
this
requires
many
unsuccessful
efforts
which
fail
on
account
of
hard
breathing
nodding
and
stumbling
against
the
paper
stand
but
success
has
at
last
been
attained
and
there
he
stands
fast
asleep
and
apparently
absorbed
in
a
most
interesting
paragraph
he
attains
such
perfection
in
this
one
act
that
he
has
been
known
to
stand
like
a
marble
statue
before
a
large
sheet
of
costly
plate
glass
what
time
sleep
had
overpowered
him
in
the
act
of
admiring
a
baker
art
the
homeless
man
must
always
remember
one
thing
that
though
he
may
sit
on
wooden
seats
and
stone
parapets
eat
in
public
and
go
in
rags
he
must
not
on
any
account
sleep
working
men
only
are
allowed
that
privilege
and
those
who
can
afford
to
remain
idle
no
policeman
would
think
of
indulging
in
a
short
nap
until
he
made
sure
that
there
was
no
vagrant
sleeping
on
his
beat
and
what
respectable
householder
could
rest
in
bed
knowing
that
a
tramp
was
sleeping
in
his
doorway
if
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
sleep
must
certainly
be
necessary
to
a
human
being
or
the
tramp
according
to
his
many
chances
of
experiments
would
be
the
first
to
prove
the
contrary
so
much
for
the
very
lowest
men
but
there
are
others
who
in
that
they
have
a
shelter
at
night
scorn
the
name
of
being
called
homeless
men
these
men
live
in
common
lodging
houses
and
are
well
satisfied
with
a
place
to
sleep
and
enough
food
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
most
of
these
men
earn
their
living
such
as
it
is
in
the
open
air
and
they
earn
so
little
that
they
are
seldom
prepared
for
a
rainy
day
therefore
when
comes
this
rainy
morn
and
the
poor
fellow
rises
penniless
from
his
bed
it
is
then
that
you
see
a
little
seriousness
come
over
him
for
he
can
not
expose
his
wares
to
spoil
in
the
rain
and
did
they
not
spoil
who
would
be
foolish
enough
to
tarry
in
bad
weather
to
make
an
idle
purchase
the
rain
would
spoil
his
his
or
his
laces
and
collar
studs
in
truth
as
long
as
the
rain
continues
his
occupation
is
gone
the
paper
seller
can
take
his
stand
regardless
of
weather
and
earn
enough
for
the
day
thereof
at
the
expense
of
a
wet
skin
sometimes
he
is
fortunate
enough
to
be
stationed
near
some
shelter
but
sometimes
his
stand
happens
to
be
outside
an
aristocratic
club
or
hotel
and
he
dare
not
enter
its
porch
not
even
if
the
devil
was
at
his
heels
then
there
is
the
downrighter
the
man
who
makes
no
pretence
to
selling
but
boldly
asks
people
for
the
price
of
his
bed
and
board
on
a
rainy
day
he
has
to
make
sudden
bursts
between
the
heaviest
showers
and
forage
the
surrounding
streets
which
being
near
a
lodging
house
are
invariably
poor
and
unprofitable
whereas
his
richest
pastures
are
in
the
suburbs
or
better
still
the
outskirts
of
them
the
bad
weather
is
of
course
a
blessing
to
those
distant
housekeepers
however
hard
it
is
on
the
downrighter
for
it
comes
as
the
sabbath
day
to
their
bells
and
knockers
then
there
are
the
market
men
who
work
two
or
three
early
hours
in
the
morning
when
the
majority
of
people
are
asleep
these
men
are
returning
in
their
wet
clothes
between
eight
and
nine
and
their
day
work
is
done
often
they
have
no
change
of
clothing
therefore
it
is
not
unusual
for
two
men
to
be
standing
at
the
same
fire
the
one
drying
his
wet
socks
and
the
other
toasting
his
dry
bread
with
the
articles
in
question
almost
embracing
one
another
on
the
most
friendly
terms
it
is
on
this
rainy
day
that
one
sees
those
little
kindnesses
which
are
only
seen
among
the
very
poor
one
who
has
not
sufficient
for
himself
assisting
some
other
who
has
nothing
one
man
who
has
made
eighteen
pence
at
the
market
returns
pays
fourpence
for
his
bed
buys
food
and
then
in
addition
to
paying
for
another
man
bed
invites
yet
another
to
dine
with
him
and
in
the
end
gives
his
last
copper
to
another
one
who
happens
to
have
done
well
the
previous
day
gives
here
and
there
until
he
is
himself
penniless
the
consequence
of
all
this
is
that
whereas
you
saw
in
the
morning
dull
and
anxious
faces
at
midday
you
see
more
than
half
of
the
lodgers
cooking
their
beds
already
paid
for
all
worry
is
at
an
end
and
they
are
whistling
humming
songs
or
chaffing
one
another
it
is
on
this
rainy
day
when
they
are
made
prisoners
without
spare
money
to
pay
into
the
beer
house
that
they
mend
and
wash
their
clothes
repair
their
boots
and
have
abundant
time
to
cook
vegetables
it
is
a
day
for
irish
stews
and
savoury
broths
it
was
on
one
of
these
days
when
the
kitchen
was
so
crowded
that
i
unfortunately
attempted
to
make
pancakes
i
knew
that
such
an
unusual
experiment
could
not
fail
to
cause
a
sensation
which
i
did
not
desire
so
i
placed
myself
in
a
dark
corner
and
quietly
and
without
being
observed
made
the
flour
into
paste
exactly
as
i
had
seen
another
lodger
do
some
time
previous
the
flour
had
been
in
my
possession
ever
since
that
occasion
but
my
courage
had
up
to
the
present
failed
three
or
four
men
were
now
at
the
stove
and
a
number
of
others
were
idly
walking
up
and
down
i
had
made
half
a
basin
of
paste
and
this
was
to
make
one
big
thick
fat
pancake
but
how
was
i
to
get
it
into
the
frying
pan
without
attracting
notice
i
covered
the
basin
with
a
saucer
placed
the
frying
pan
on
the
stove
with
butter
therein
and
waited
my
chance
i
had
taken
the
precaution
of
having
in
readiness
a
large
plate
at
last
my
chance
came
for
two
cooks
were
having
high
words
as
to
whether
cabbage
should
be
put
into
cold
or
boiling
water
others
joined
in
this
argument
so
without
receiving
notice
i
dropped
the
paste
into
the
frying
pan
and
quickly
covered
it
with
a
large
plate
so
far
so
good
my
only
difficulty
now
would
be
to
turn
it
for
after
it
was
cooked
i
could
carry
the
pan
and
its
covered
contents
to
the
dark
corner
where
i
intended
to
dine
and
where
although
men
might
see
me
eat
none
would
be
the
wiser
as
to
what
i
was
eating
five
minutes
had
passed
and
no
doubt
its
one
side
was
cooked
the
argument
was
still
in
full
swing
for
each
man
stoutly
maintained
his
opinions
and
almost
every
man
who
took
part
cited
his
mother
or
sister
as
an
authority
except
one
who
proudly
mentioned
a
french
chef
in
an
australian
gold
diggings
now
was
my
chance
i
cast
one
furtive
glance
around
rose
the
hot
plate
with
a
stocking
which
i
had
been
washing
made
one
quick
turn
of
the
wrist
spun
the
pancake
in
the
air
caught
it
neatly
and
promptly
clapped
the
plate
over
it
the
whole
process
done
i
believe
in
less
than
ten
seconds
the
difficulty
was
now
over
and
i
breathed
relief
i
went
to
my
dining
corner
and
sat
down
intending
to
fetch
the
pancake
in
five
minutes
time
three
minutes
perhaps
i
had
been
seated
when
i
heard
a
loud
voice
cry
whose
pancake
is
this
burning
on
the
stove
how
i
did
detest
that
man
he
was
always
shouting
through
the
kitchen
whose
stew
is
this
boiling
over
or
whose
tea
is
stewing
on
the
fire
the
man
always
seemed
to
be
poking
his
nose
into
other
people
business
i
did
not
think
it
worth
while
drawing
every
one
attention
by
answering
him
but
made
my
way
as
quietly
as
possible
towards
the
stove
alas
the
idiot
not
thinking
that
i
was
the
owner
of
the
pancake
and
was
then
on
my
way
to
attend
to
it
shouted
the
second
time
louder
and
it
seemed
to
me
too
impatiently
whose
pancake
is
this
if
i
was
vexed
when
i
heard
that
second
enquiry
imagine
how
i
felt
when
every
lodger
in
the
kitchen
not
seeing
or
hearing
from
the
pancake
lawful
claimant
began
to
shout
in
angry
voices
whose
pancake
is
that
burning
on
the
fire
my
own
patience
was
now
exhausted
the
pancake
is
mine
i
said
and
what
about
it
what
is
all
this
fuss
about
it
is
the
first
pancake
i
have
ever
attempted
to
make
and
by
heavens
if
it
is
to
cause
such
a
stir
as
this
it
will
be
the
last
but
while
i
was
making
this
speech
another
voice
which
froze
the
blood
in
my
veins
cried
angrily
whose
pancake
is
this
it
was
a
woman
voice
it
was
the
of
the
house
and
i
now
knew
that
something
more
serious
was
happening
than
the
burning
of
a
pancake
i
was
burning
her
frying
pan
if
i
dallied
in
respect
to
my
pancakes
i
must
certainly
not
make
further
delay
in
saving
the
frying
pan
to
her
i
at
once
apologised
but
i
gave
that
meddler
a
look
that
for
ever
again
kept
him
silent
as
to
what
belonged
to
me
such
are
the
doings
in
a
lodging
house
vexatious
enough
at
the
time
but
amusing
to
recall
chapter
xxvii
false
hopes
the
farmhouse
was
under
the
management
of
an
irishman
and
his
wife
he
with
a
generous
heart
that
always
kept
him
poor
for
he
often
assisted
lodgers
towards
paying
for
their
beds
who
i
am
sorry
to
say
were
sometimes
ungrateful
in
return
she
more
circumspect
but
kind
hearted
and
motherly
where
she
thought
the
case
to
be
a
deserving
one
with
regards
to
literary
ambition
i
always
kept
my
own
counsel
confiding
in
one
man
only
cronje
a
man
to
be
relied
on
whose
sympathetic
ears
were
always
open
to
receive
either
good
or
bad
news
i
must
have
been
in
this
house
something
like
twelve
months
when
i
took
a
sudden
notion
to
send
some
work
to
a
literary
man
asking
him
for
his
opinion
of
the
same
in
a
few
days
i
received
a
letter
stating
that
want
of
time
prevented
him
from
passing
judgment
on
my
work
which
he
regretted
he
would
have
to
return
unread
this
did
not
offend
me
in
the
least
although
i
was
greatly
disappointed
for
i
knew
that
a
man
in
his
position
could
have
little
time
to
spare
and
no
doubt
was
pestered
with
correspondence
of
a
like
nature
but
unfortunately
the
returned
in
an
ill
condition
having
been
roughly
handled
through
the
post
and
arrived
at
the
farmhouse
with
the
ends
of
the
envelope
in
tatters
when
i
received
this
ragged
and
disreputable
parcel
from
the
manager
i
knew
that
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag
and
that
the
secret
which
i
had
guarded
so
jealously
was
now
the
property
of
another
but
i
made
no
confession
thinking
that
he
would
broach
the
subject
which
he
did
on
the
following
morning
on
enquiring
if
the
parcel
i
had
received
on
the
day
previous
was
a
manuscript
i
lost
no
time
in
telling
him
everything
the
upshot
of
this
was
that
he
persuaded
me
to
send
some
work
to
a
publisher
and
if
that
gentleman
thought
the
book
worth
publication
he
the
manager
had
no
doubt
that
one
of
the
many
rich
people
who
were
connected
with
the
farmhouse
mission
could
be
induced
to
assist
me
hearing
this
i
was
sorry
that
i
had
not
confided
in
him
of
my
own
accord
for
i
had
often
seen
these
rich
people
coming
and
going
looking
perhaps
for
deserving
cases
with
these
golden
projects
before
me
i
again
set
to
work
and
in
less
than
a
month
the
was
ready
and
in
the
hands
of
a
publisher
that
gentleman
wrote
in
a
few
days
saying
that
he
thought
there
was
literary
merit
and
that
the
cost
of
production
would
be
thirty
pounds
the
publisher
name
was
well
known
and
the
manager
was
quite
satisfied
as
to
its
being
a
genuine
offer
from
an
old
and
respectable
firm
quite
contented
in
my
own
mind
my
part
having
been
performed
without
difficulty
i
gladly
allowed
this
man
to
take
possession
of
this
correspondence
and
a
few
specimen
books
of
verse
which
the
publisher
had
sent
with
it
and
having
full
trust
in
the
goodness
and
influence
made
myself
comfortable
and
settled
down
in
a
fool
paradise
i
have
never
had
cause
to
doubt
his
goodness
but
he
certainly
overrated
his
power
to
influence
the
philanthropists
on
the
behalf
of
a
lodger
several
weeks
passed
and
i
had
received
no
encouraging
news
no
mention
had
been
made
of
my
affairs
and
i
gave
myself
over
to
the
influence
of
the
coke
fire
after
going
out
in
the
morning
for
two
or
three
hours
i
would
return
at
midday
often
earlier
and
sit
hopelessly
before
this
fire
for
ten
or
eleven
hours
after
which
i
would
retire
to
my
room
what
a
miserable
time
was
this
the
kitchen
foul
with
the
breath
of
fifty
or
sixty
men
and
the
fumes
of
the
coke
fire
took
all
the
energy
out
of
a
man
and
it
was
a
hard
fight
to
keep
awake
it
has
taken
the
play
out
of
the
kitten
and
this
small
animal
lies
stretched
out
overcome
by
its
fumes
without
the
least
fear
of
being
trodden
on
sometimes
when
i
endeavoured
to
concentrate
my
mind
with
an
idea
of
writing
something
it
was
necessary
to
feign
a
sleep
so
that
these
kind
hearted
fellows
might
not
disturb
me
with
their
civilities
on
these
occasions
it
was
not
unusual
for
me
to
fall
into
a
real
sleep
and
when
i
awoke
it
sickened
me
to
think
of
this
wasted
time
for
i
was
spending
in
bed
more
hours
than
were
necessary
for
my
health
and
it
was
a
most
cruel
waste
of
time
to
be
sleeping
in
the
day
this
fire
exerted
a
strange
influence
over
us
in
the
morning
we
were
loath
to
leave
it
and
we
all
returned
to
it
as
soon
as
possible
even
the
books
and
magazines
in
the
libraries
could
not
seduce
me
longer
than
an
hour
there
was
one
seat
at
the
corner
of
a
table
which
i
have
heard
called
the
dead
man
seat
it
was
within
two
yards
of
this
great
fire
which
was
never
allowed
to
suffer
from
want
of
coke
it
was
impossible
to
retain
this
seat
long
and
keep
awake
of
course
a
man
could
hardly
expect
to
keep
this
seat
day
after
day
for
a
long
winter
and
to
be
alive
in
the
spring
of
the
year
this
was
the
case
with
a
printer
who
unfortunately
had
only
three
days
work
a
week
the
amount
he
earned
was
sufficient
for
his
wants
so
in
his
four
idle
days
he
would
sit
on
this
seat
eating
reading
but
more
often
sleeping
until
before
the
end
of
the
winter
he
was
carried
away
a
dying
man
some
of
these
lodgers
claim
to
be
able
to
recognise
in
the
public
streets
any
strangers
who
are
suffering
from
this
coke
fever
weeks
passed
and
then
months
and
i
still
heard
nothing
about
my
book
the
manager
had
failed
of
that
i
at
last
became
certain
i
avoided
him
as
much
as
possible
because
of
the
confidence
i
had
reposed
in
him
it
was
certainly
very
awkward
for
the
both
of
us
and
i
felt
much
sympathy
on
his
account
when
he
was
near
i
felt
extremely
uncomfortable
and
i
am
sure
he
felt
none
too
easy
in
my
presence
spring
at
last
came
and
i
broke
away
from
the
lodging
house
fire
to
indulge
in
the
more
pure
rays
of
the
sun
i
began
to
absent
myself
from
the
house
longer
every
day
until
i
at
last
began
to
regret
that
there
was
any
necessity
to
return
to
it
at
all
the
happiness
and
stir
of
nature
at
this
time
of
the
year
began
to
fill
me
with
her
own
energy
i
was
in
my
room
one
of
these
bright
mornings
and
was
looking
in
the
mirror
adjusting
my
scarf
the
mirror
and
bed
being
the
whole
furniture
in
this
mirror
i
looked
long
enough
to
see
a
white
hair
on
the
side
of
my
head
thinking
this
to
be
hardly
true
at
my
time
of
life
i
shifted
the
glass
to
a
better
light
thinking
it
must
have
played
me
false
but
sure
enough
here
it
was
a
single
hair
as
white
as
snow
yes
i
thought
with
some
bitterness
this
comes
of
waiting
to
be
fulfilled
the
promises
of
other
people
and
you
will
never
rise
if
you
do
not
make
some
effort
of
your
own
thinking
of
this
white
hair
i
left
the
house
wondering
what
i
could
do
to
help
myself
and
this
particular
morning
an
idea
occurred
to
me
so
simple
so
reasonable
and
so
easily
to
be
accomplished
that
it
filled
me
with
surprise
that
such
a
plan
had
not
presented
itself
before
i
had
an
income
of
eight
shillings
per
week
then
what
was
to
prevent
me
from
borrowing
forty
or
fifty
pounds
even
though
i
paid
for
it
a
little
more
than
usual
interest
again
i
was
full
of
hope
and
happiness
for
i
could
see
nothing
to
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
this
my
eight
shillings
were
being
received
in
sums
of
two
pounds
every
five
weeks
two
shillings
a
week
were
forwarded
home
and
i
lived
abstemiously
on
the
remainder
my
five
weeks
money
was
due
on
the
following
week
so
i
at
once
began
making
preparations
for
a
trip
home
when
this
money
arrived
i
determined
to
lose
no
time
in
executing
these
plans
for
i
had
visions
of
being
a
white
headed
man
if
i
remained
under
these
hopeless
conditions
for
another
year
or
two
the
money
came
on
saturday
night
when
it
was
due
and
everything
being
prepared
i
was
that
very
night
on
my
way
to
paddington
station
after
having
told
the
manager
that
i
was
going
home
for
a
week
and
that
i
would
forward
him
my
rent
if
i
remained
longer
than
that
time
full
of
this
idea
i
arrived
at
home
the
following
monday
i
invaded
the
office
of
my
old
granny
lawyer
and
telling
him
i
wished
to
set
up
in
business
consulted
him
as
to
the
best
way
of
borrowing
the
money
some
forty
or
fifty
pounds
being
necessary
he
saw
nothing
to
prevent
this
from
being
done
but
strongly
advised
me
not
to
do
so
at
any
rate
he
said
see
your
trustee
ask
him
if
he
can
lend
you
the
amount
and
if
he
can
not
see
his
way
clear
to
do
so
let
me
know
in
half
an
hour
i
was
with
the
trustee
that
gentleman
had
not
the
amount
on
hand
but
had
plans
of
his
own
which
if
i
strictly
adhered
to
would
be
more
to
my
advantage
in
the
long
run
it
is
now
june
he
said
and
if
you
allow
your
income
to
stand
until
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
you
will
then
have
ten
pounds
saved
to
your
account
and
i
give
you
my
promise
to
advance
another
twenty
pounds
without
a
question
of
interest
making
the
amount
thirty
pounds
now
it
happened
that
three
weeks
before
i
left
london
i
had
sent
a
work
to
a
printer
and
publisher
who
had
priced
two
hundred
and
fifty
copies
at
nineteen
pounds
so
that
i
knew
well
that
thirty
pounds
would
be
ample
to
meet
all
expenses
but
how
was
i
to
live
for
the
next
six
months
determined
to
make
any
sacrifice
to
attain
this
end
i
closed
with
the
trustee
offer
and
getting
an
advance
from
him
of
one
pound
intended
to
return
at
once
to
london
but
was
persuaded
to
remain
at
home
for
another
three
weeks
at
the
end
of
this
time
i
paid
my
fare
back
to
london
and
again
took
possession
of
my
room
for
which
i
had
forwarded
the
rent
during
my
absence
in
less
than
four
days
after
my
return
i
was
very
near
penniless
and
saw
no
other
prospect
than
to
start
on
another
half
year
wandering
how
foolish
all
this
was
why
did
i
not
start
my
travels
from
home
instead
of
wasting
money
on
a
return
fare
to
london
why
did
i
pay
three
weeks
rent
for
the
sake
of
returning
to
a
room
for
as
many
days
well
i
had
a
faint
hope
that
the
manager
might
at
last
after
six
months
have
succeeded
in
his
attempt
i
told
the
manager
that
i
was
going
on
the
road
for
a
month
or
two
but
mentioned
no
purpose
for
i
was
now
resolved
to
act
for
myself
you
will
always
find
room
at
the
farmhouse
he
said
do
not
doubt
that
trying
to
appear
as
cheerful
as
possible
for
i
knew
this
man
was
also
disappointed
i
left
him
determined
never
to
set
foot
in
that
house
again
until
i
could
dispense
with
the
services
of
others
at
this
time
i
had
two
silver
shillings
and
some
odd
coppers
and
would
soon
need
assistance
as
a
man
without
any
question
as
to
my
work
as
an
author
again
i
was
leaving
london
not
knowing
how
much
i
would
have
to
suffer
one
idea
consoled
me
not
a
little
that
i
would
not
require
money
for
a
bed
for
at
least
three
months
to
come
that
the
nights
though
cold
would
not
be
so
dangerous
as
to
kill
whatever
the
consequence
might
be
even
if
this
rough
life
threatened
to
injure
my
health
permanently
i
was
firmly
resolved
to
sacrifice
the
next
six
months
for
whatever
might
follow
them
chapter
xxviii
on
tramp
again
now
followed
a
strange
experience
an
experience
for
which
there
is
no
name
for
i
managed
to
exist
and
yet
had
neither
the
courage
to
beg
or
sell
certainly
at
times
i
was
desperately
inclined
to
steal
but
chance
left
nothing
for
my
eyes
to
covet
and
i
passed
harmlessly
on
when
i
suffered
most
from
lack
of
rest
or
bodily
sustenance
as
my
actual
experience
became
darker
the
thoughts
of
the
future
became
brighter
as
the
stars
shine
to
correspond
with
the
night
shade
i
travelled
alone
in
spite
of
the
civilities
of
other
tramps
who
desired
company
so
as
to
allow
no
strange
voice
to
disturb
my
dreams
some
of
these
men
had
an
idea
that
i
was
mad
because
i
could
give
them
little
information
as
to
the
towns
and
villages
through
which
i
had
that
very
day
passed
they
enquired
as
to
the
comforts
and
conditions
of
a
town
workhouse
of
which
i
knew
nothing
for
i
had
not
entered
it
they
enquired
as
to
its
best
lodging
house
of
which
i
was
again
ignorant
having
slept
in
the
open
air
they
enquired
how
far
i
had
come
that
day
which
i
could
not
immediately
tell
them
and
they
were
curious
to
know
how
far
i
was
going
which
i
did
not
know
the
strangest
part
of
this
experience
was
that
i
received
help
from
people
without
having
made
a
glance
of
appeal
and
without
having
opened
my
mouth
when
i
asked
for
water
tea
or
milk
was
often
brought
and
food
invariably
followed
i
began
to
look
on
this
as
a
short
life
of
sacrifice
killing
a
few
worthless
hours
so
as
to
enjoy
thousands
of
better
ones
and
i
blessed
every
morning
that
ushered
in
a
new
day
and
worshipped
every
sabbath
night
that
closed
another
week
after
tramping
from
town
to
town
from
shire
to
shire
in
two
months
i
was
in
devonshire
on
my
way
to
plymouth
i
felt
continually
attracted
to
these
large
centres
of
commerce
owing
i
suppose
to
feeling
the
necessity
of
having
an
object
in
view
but
was
generally
starved
out
of
them
in
a
very
short
time
a
gentleman
on
horseback
whom
i
met
near
totnes
saved
me
from
suffering
from
want
for
a
couple
of
days
at
least
when
i
would
reach
plymouth
this
gentleman
drew
his
horse
to
a
halt
so
that
he
might
enquire
my
destination
he
seemed
to
be
much
surprised
when
i
told
him
it
was
the
town
of
plymouth
ah
well
he
said
glancing
towards
the
ground
there
is
only
one
foot
to
get
sore
if
that
is
any
consolation
to
you
perhaps
this
will
help
you
a
little
on
the
way
dropping
into
my
hand
three
silver
shillings
without
having
this
case
in
mind
i
certainly
fared
better
in
devonshire
than
in
other
counties
and
found
its
people
more
like
the
prosperous
settlers
in
new
lands
in
spite
of
this
my
roughest
experience
was
in
this
county
owing
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
and
the
difficulty
of
finding
shelter
one
night
i
had
gone
into
the
fields
and
getting
together
a
dozen
or
more
wheatsheaves
proceeded
to
build
a
house
of
them
making
a
dry
floor
on
the
damp
earth
with
walls
to
shelter
from
the
wind
and
a
roof
to
shelter
from
the
dew
leaving
just
space
enough
at
one
end
to
admit
my
body
i
had
been
in
here
comfortable
and
warm
for
some
time
when
it
began
to
rain
in
half
an
hour
the
rain
leaked
in
large
drops
through
the
roof
and
in
less
than
an
hour
these
drops
had
become
streams
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
remain
for
it
was
now
too
dark
to
seek
shelter
for
ten
hours
it
rained
incessantly
and
i
was
literally
wet
to
the
skin
and
no
drier
than
a
person
immersed
in
water
not
wet
to
the
skin
as
people
commonly
express
it
when
they
are
damp
after
a
few
showers
i
was
nothing
daunted
looking
on
this
as
one
of
the
many
hard
experiences
that
i
was
compelled
to
undergo
the
next
morning
i
chose
a
secluded
spot
in
the
open
air
so
as
to
lie
down
where
the
sun
coming
out
warm
and
strong
would
dry
me
while
i
slept
two
or
three
times
have
i
suffered
in
this
way
but
have
never
felt
any
ill
effects
after
my
worst
experience
of
this
kind
was
in
the
adjoining
county
of
somerset
at
the
end
of
september
when
i
was
again
making
my
way
back
to
london
but
it
was
not
the
blowing
of
the
wind
or
the
patter
of
the
rain
not
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
on
the
swaying
branches
not
the
discomforts
of
having
wet
clothes
and
being
without
sign
of
a
barn
or
empty
house
in
which
to
shelter
it
was
none
of
these
that
took
the
courage
out
of
me
it
was
a
wild
laugh
harsh
and
apparently
in
savage
mockery
i
had
skirted
what
appeared
to
be
a
park
for
something
like
two
miles
and
was
weary
to
see
the
end
of
it
this
at
last
seemed
to
come
for
i
could
see
through
the
trees
a
large
open
field
wherein
were
wheatsheaves
stacked
in
their
threes
and
in
their
usual
rows
now
had
this
been
a
field
right
up
to
the
roadside
i
would
most
certainly
have
had
no
compunction
in
spending
the
night
there
being
tired
of
carrying
such
a
distance
my
wet
and
heavy
clothes
as
it
was
i
paused
not
feeling
inclined
to
proceed
further
on
my
journey
and
yet
not
half
liking
to
cross
that
narrow
strip
of
park
thinking
it
might
contain
game
that
would
be
well
looked
after
making
trespassing
a
serious
offence
when
in
this
irresolute
state
of
mind
i
caught
sight
of
a
white
gate
and
a
small
footpath
leading
to
the
field
night
seemed
to
be
coming
on
at
the
rate
of
a
darker
shade
to
the
minute
and
i
knew
well
that
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
it
would
be
difficult
to
distinguish
a
house
from
a
barn
seeing
this
i
summoned
courage
opened
the
gate
and
made
my
way
quickly
along
the
path
that
led
to
the
wheatsheaves
standing
amidst
these
i
waited
silently
listening
for
any
that
might
be
in
that
locality
satisfied
that
there
were
not
i
picked
up
a
sheaf
and
was
about
to
lay
it
flat
when
i
heard
a
loud
startling
laugh
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
road
dropping
the
sheaf
at
once
i
bent
low
not
for
a
moment
doubting
but
what
some
one
had
seen
me
from
the
road
and
was
taking
a
heartless
delight
in
letting
me
know
his
discovery
although
i
regretted
this
thinking
he
would
inform
others
and
i
would
surely
be
disturbed
before
morning
perhaps
that
very
hour
i
determined
to
travel
no
further
that
night
if
i
could
help
it
and
proceeded
to
make
my
bed
under
the
impression
that
he
had
passed
on
i
stood
up
in
full
but
had
scarcely
done
so
when
my
appearance
was
greeted
by
several
long
shouts
of
derisive
laughter
now
a
homeless
man
has
no
time
to
be
superstitious
he
fears
the
living
and
not
the
dead
if
he
is
sleepy
he
is
not
particular
about
feeling
in
the
darkness
of
cellars
or
vaults
and
if
he
were
sleeping
on
a
grave
and
was
awakened
by
a
voice
crying
arise
from
off
this
grave
he
would
at
once
think
it
the
voice
of
a
grave
digger
or
the
keeper
of
the
cemetery
rather
than
the
ghostly
owner
of
the
same
therefore
i
had
not
the
least
idea
but
what
this
was
the
voice
of
a
human
being
although
it
sounded
uncanny
and
strange
i
moved
again
and
again
heard
that
loud
peal
of
laughter
this
voice
evidently
only
mocked
when
i
moved
for
when
i
stood
still
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
this
time
i
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
making
a
bed
and
being
now
filled
with
fear
picked
up
the
thick
stick
with
which
i
travelled
and
stood
on
the
defensive
every
moment
expecting
to
see
a
madman
burst
from
under
the
trees
and
in
three
leaps
and
a
bound
be
at
my
side
these
movements
seemed
to
cause
some
merriment
but
the
laughter
again
ceased
when
i
stood
watching
and
waiting
and
puzzled
how
to
act
rest
was
now
out
of
the
question
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
that
accursed
place
instantly
with
this
intention
i
made
my
way
towards
the
gate
i
had
scarcely
moved
in
that
direction
when
the
laughing
began
this
time
continuing
for
a
long
time
as
though
jeering
its
last
at
my
defeat
when
i
reached
the
gate
and
passed
through
to
the
open
road
my
courage
returned
and
i
looked
with
some
bitterness
to
see
the
figure
of
some
country
lout
hurrying
into
the
darkness
after
succeeding
in
robbing
me
of
my
sleep
but
to
my
surprise
i
heard
no
one
and
could
see
no
figure
on
the
road
before
or
behind
it
was
now
that
superstition
took
hold
of
me
and
i
got
off
with
all
possible
speed
often
looking
back
to
see
if
i
was
pursued
and
i
did
not
stop
until
a
human
settlement
lay
between
me
and
that
accursed
park
often
have
i
thought
of
that
night
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
a
thoughtless
ploughman
or
farm
labourer
would
have
stood
at
the
roadside
and
laughed
or
shouted
once
or
twice
and
then
passed
on
but
it
is
scarcely
probable
that
he
would
have
remained
there
to
carry
his
joke
so
far
granted
that
he
had
had
the
courage
to
laugh
so
many
times
taunting
one
at
a
distance
where
was
his
courage
now
that
he
had
run
away
or
still
stood
concealed
behind
the
trees
the
voice
sounded
human
but
still
seemed
wild
and
a
little
unnatural
after
much
consideration
the
only
conclusion
i
could
put
to
the
affair
was
that
the
voice
came
from
a
bird
in
the
trees
an
escaped
pet
bird
that
could
imitate
the
human
voice
this
solution
of
the
mystery
did
not
altogether
satisfy
me
for
i
have
never
had
cause
to
believe
that
any
bird
could
so
perfectly
imitate
the
human
voice
superstition
must
have
thoroughly
possessed
me
for
the
once
in
my
life
or
i
should
not
have
walked
all
night
after
the
painful
exertion
of
the
day
if
i
settled
towards
night
time
in
any
place
where
a
bird
came
hopping
restlessly
from
branch
to
branch
making
a
series
of
short
cries
of
fear
to
let
me
know
that
i
was
lying
too
close
to
its
nest
i
would
without
hesitation
shift
my
position
often
to
my
own
discomfort
but
at
the
same
time
people
could
pass
to
and
fro
to
my
indifference
i
would
never
beg
unless
forced
to
the
last
extremity
for
i
feared
the
strange
fascination
that
arises
from
success
after
a
man
has
once
lost
his
shame
on
one
occasion
i
saw
a
well
dressed
couple
wheeling
their
bicycles
up
an
incline
which
was
too
steep
to
ride
evidently
they
were
lovers
for
they
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
to
reach
the
top
of
the
hill
and
end
their
conversation
by
riding
as
i
drew
near
the
lady
produced
her
purse
and
placing
something
in
her
hand
motioned
over
her
shoulder
in
my
direction
on
which
the
gentleman
nodded
and
immediately
glanced
back
towards
me
now
these
people
could
not
very
well
make
the
first
overtures
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
know
not
whether
a
man
is
in
want
or
is
a
poor
but
proud
and
respectable
inhabitant
of
one
of
the
adjacent
villages
i
preferred
to
impress
them
with
the
latter
opinion
for
when
i
reached
them
i
put
on
an
extra
spurt
and
was
soon
beyond
their
hearing
no
i
would
never
make
a
good
beggar
for
here
was
money
in
readiness
to
come
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
or
to
be
drawn
by
the
simple
side
glance
of
my
eye
when
i
was
some
distance
away
i
looked
back
and
saw
the
lady
looking
rather
disappointed
receiving
back
her
coin
her
companion
was
laughing
no
doubt
consoling
her
by
saying
that
i
was
hardly
likely
to
be
in
actual
need
or
i
would
have
asked
for
assistance
and
probably
my
home
was
somewhere
near
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
at
this
time
i
had
not
a
copper
to
bless
myself
with
days
weeks
and
months
went
on
and
it
was
now
the
month
of
october
it
was
now
that
i
began
to
find
the
necessity
of
having
a
bed
every
night
having
been
satisfied
up
till
then
with
a
bed
once
or
perhaps
twice
a
week
according
to
the
coppers
received
i
was
back
again
in
swindon
having
been
there
some
time
previous
when
on
my
way
to
devonshire
the
first
three
months
of
sacrifice
were
over
and
i
was
very
little
the
worse
for
it
but
the
next
three
months
required
different
means
to
correspond
with
the
difference
in
the
time
of
year
shelter
was
necessary
every
night
and
to
meet
these
stern
demands
i
needed
something
to
sell
so
as
to
be
sure
of
coppers
for
this
purpose
with
this
idea
i
bought
two
dozen
laces
with
the
last
three
coppers
i
had
and
business
as
a
hawker
the
success
with
which
i
met
in
this
town
astonished
me
owing
i
believe
to
its
being
a
working
man
town
and
not
filled
with
officers
and
aristocrats
that
can
not
afford
but
still
feel
it
their
duty
to
live
in
fine
villas
in
the
locality
of
a
royal
residence
the
poor
sympathetic
people
seemed
to
understand
a
man
wants
business
was
often
transacted
without
the
utterance
of
words
taking
a
pair
of
laces
they
would
give
a
copper
and
smiling
their
sympathy
close
the
door
often
one
would
pay
for
these
useless
things
and
not
take
them
the
kindness
of
these
people
so
filled
me
with
gratitude
that
i
found
it
impossible
to
continue
selling
after
i
had
received
enough
to
supply
the
day
wants
which
would
often
be
in
less
than
half
an
hour
i
remained
here
for
two
weeks
being
able
to
allow
myself
half
an
ounce
of
tobacco
and
a
halfpenny
paper
every
day
the
only
thing
that
worried
me
in
this
town
was
the
persistence
of
an
old
beggar
in
the
lodging
house
night
after
night
this
man
would
advise
me
to
go
out
and
stand
pad
this
was
he
explained
that
a
man
who
is
afflicted
with
the
loss
of
an
arm
a
hand
or
a
leg
blind
paralysed
or
lame
should
stand
or
sit
in
a
public
place
in
the
town
holding
in
his
hand
matches
laces
or
any
other
cheap
trifle
so
that
he
might
invite
the
charity
of
passers
by
this
old
man
could
not
understand
why
this
was
not
done
seeing
that
it
required
no
eloquence
the
very
act
and
the
affliction
speaking
for
themselves
and
was
so
successful
a
dodge
that
even
men
could
often
pick
up
a
shilling
or
two
in
this
way
at
last
i
became
so
impressed
with
this
old
eloquence
that
i
left
the
lodging
house
three
times
in
one
night
with
a
firm
resolution
to
stand
pad
and
three
times
i
returned
without
having
done
so
on
the
last
occasion
i
did
make
a
little
attempt
but
foolishly
took
up
a
position
where
no
one
could
see
me
before
i
left
swindon
i
wrote
to
a
friend
of
mine
in
canada
requesting
him
to
forward
me
a
pound
to
london
as
soon
as
possible
which
would
be
returned
to
him
at
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
i
did
this
so
that
i
might
have
a
couple
of
weeks
at
the
end
of
december
to
prepare
my
and
to
be
ready
for
business
as
soon
as
that
time
arrived
it
was
now
the
latter
end
of
october
and
this
pound
could
not
reach
london
far
short
of
a
month
thinking
i
was
not
likely
again
to
suffer
for
want
of
a
bed
or
food
after
this
success
in
swindon
i
bought
a
good
stock
of
laces
and
left
that
town
with
the
intention
of
working
the
towns
on
the
outskirts
of
london
so
that
when
ready
to
enter
i
would
be
within
a
day
march
unfortunately
after
leaving
swindon
success
deserted
me
which
was
certainly
more
my
fault
than
that
of
the
people
for
i
made
very
little
appeal
to
them
arriving
at
maidenhead
i
had
the
bare
price
of
my
bed
with
a
dry
bread
supper
and
breakfast
my
laces
were
being
exhausted
and
i
was
without
means
to
replenish
them
from
town
to
town
i
walked
around
london
sometimes
making
sixpence
and
always
less
than
a
shilling
a
day
and
this
small
amount
had
to
purchase
bed
food
and
occasionally
a
couple
of
dozen
laces
the
monotony
of
this
existence
was
broken
a
little
at
guildford
where
i
was
arrested
on
suspicion
of
crime
a
plain
clothes
officer
happened
to
be
in
the
office
of
the
lodging
house
who
when
he
set
eyes
upon
me
requested
a
few
moments
conversation
at
the
same
time
leading
the
way
out
into
the
yard
he
then
came
to
a
halt
under
a
lamp
and
taking
from
his
pocket
some
papers
began
to
read
often
raising
his
eyes
to
scrutinise
my
person
yes
he
said
at
last
no
doubt
you
are
the
man
i
want
for
you
answer
his
description
i
suppose
was
my
answer
it
is
a
case
of
arrest
it
is
he
said
and
you
must
accompany
me
to
the
station
on
my
way
to
that
place
he
asked
many
a
question
of
what
i
had
done
with
my
overcoat
and
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
my
wife
it
had
been
several
years
since
i
had
owned
the
former
and
the
latter
i
had
never
possessed
but
this
man
could
not
be
convinced
of
either
which
way
have
you
come
he
asked
to
which
i
mentioned
one
or
two
shires
at
this
he
pricked
up
his
ears
and
asked
if
i
had
been
in
a
certain
town
in
one
of
those
shires
which
i
had
and
saw
no
reason
to
say
otherwise
unfortunately
this
was
the
town
where
the
guilty
man
had
operated
the
detective
was
certainly
not
very
smart
when
he
took
this
confession
as
evidence
of
guilt
for
the
guilty
man
would
have
mentioned
that
particular
town
as
one
of
the
last
places
to
visit
i
certainly
answered
to
the
description
of
the
man
wanted
with
the
exception
of
not
having
a
blotchy
face
which
had
been
characteristic
of
the
guilty
man
but
on
my
face
they
saw
no
blotches
nor
signs
of
any
having
been
there
in
the
past
of
course
i
was
discharged
in
an
hour
and
returned
to
the
lodging
house
for
the
night
the
following
day
i
happened
to
be
in
dorking
and
was
walking
through
that
town
when
i
heard
quick
steps
behind
me
and
a
voice
cry
halt
i
want
you
turning
my
head
i
saw
it
was
a
police
officer
this
man
at
once
took
possession
of
me
saying
that
he
fortunately
had
been
looking
through
the
police
station
window
when
he
saw
me
passing
and
that
i
answered
to
the
description
of
a
man
wanted
for
that
affair
at
cheltenham
i
added
ha
he
said
his
face
lighting
with
pleasure
how
well
you
know
we
returned
quietly
to
the
police
station
and
when
i
confronted
his
superior
officer
i
asked
that
person
if
i
was
to
be
arrested
in
every
town
through
which
i
passed
telling
my
experience
the
night
before
at
guildford
after
one
or
two
questions
and
a
careful
reading
of
the
description
paper
also
an
examination
of
my
pedlar
certificate
he
told
me
i
was
at
liberty
to
go
my
way
at
the
same
time
saying
that
no
man
with
any
sense
would
have
arrested
me
after
this
i
was
not
again
troubled
by
police
officers
owing
perhaps
to
their
having
arrested
the
guilty
man
chapter
xxix
a
day
companion
i
had
many
a
strange
experience
in
those
days
especially
one
with
an
old
man
who
must
have
been
between
seventy
and
eighty
years
of
age
he
accosted
me
through
the
hedges
and
looking
in
that
direction
i
saw
him
in
the
act
of
filling
a
quart
can
with
blackberries
aided
by
a
thick
long
stick
with
a
crooked
end
wait
a
moment
said
he
for
i
also
am
going
bedford
way
i
was
nothing
loth
to
wait
for
i
was
a
stranger
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
required
information
as
to
which
was
the
best
cheap
lodging
house
for
the
night
i
knew
that
in
a
town
of
the
size
of
bedford
there
must
be
more
than
one
common
lodging
house
and
one
must
be
better
than
another
if
only
in
the
extra
smile
of
a
landlady
regardless
of
clean
blankets
or
cooking
accommodation
for
this
reason
i
waited
and
in
less
than
three
minutes
the
old
man
joined
me
his
answer
to
my
first
question
was
disappointing
for
it
seemed
that
the
number
of
lodging
houses
which
bedford
could
boast
were
all
public
houses
and
there
was
not
one
private
house
that
catered
for
beggars
this
was
a
real
disappointment
for
i
knew
that
whosoever
made
tea
at
such
a
place
did
so
under
the
ill
favoured
glance
of
a
landlady
or
landlord
perhaps
both
who
sold
beer
ready
made
in
fact
the
facilities
for
making
tea
cooking
or
even
washing
one
shirt
were
extremely
limited
at
such
a
place
which
made
it
very
undesirable
for
a
poor
beggar
like
myself
who
had
great
difficulty
in
begging
sufficient
for
his
bed
and
board
and
did
not
wish
to
be
reminded
of
beer
surely
i
said
there
must
be
in
a
town
the
size
of
bedford
one
private
lodging
house
at
least
to
accommodate
tramps
well
said
he
as
a
tramp
i
have
been
going
in
and
out
of
that
town
for
over
thirty
years
and
i
never
heard
of
such
a
place
you
can
make
enquiries
and
i
should
like
to
know
different
he
continued
rather
sarcastically
that
i
had
doubted
his
knowledge
the
two
best
houses
are
the
and
the
but
seeing
that
the
former
takes
in
women
the
latter
i
think
would
be
the
best
for
us
are
you
going
to
do
business
on
the
road
he
enquired
not
i
answered
him
for
i
have
enough
for
my
bed
and
an
extra
few
coppers
for
food
all
right
said
he
we
will
travel
together
and
if
i
do
a
little
business
on
the
way
it
wo
interfere
with
you
and
we
have
plenty
of
time
to
reach
the
lodging
house
before
dark
having
no
objection
to
this
proposal
we
jogged
pleasantly
along
we
were
now
descending
a
steep
incline
and
my
companion
seeing
a
man
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
walking
beside
a
bicycle
lost
no
time
in
confronting
that
gentleman
and
pushing
the
blackberries
under
his
nose
no
said
the
man
gruffly
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
carry
those
things
but
here
a
copper
for
you
well
thought
i
this
man
will
never
sell
his
berries
if
he
does
not
show
more
discretion
and
offer
them
to
more
likely
customers
just
after
this
we
met
a
lady
and
gentleman
both
well
dressed
and
apparently
well
to
do
touching
his
cap
to
these
people
my
companion
soon
had
his
blackberries
within
a
few
inches
of
their
eyes
at
the
same
time
using
all
his
persuasive
powers
to
induce
them
to
make
a
purchase
in
this
he
failed
as
was
to
be
expected
but
continued
to
walk
step
by
step
with
them
for
several
yards
until
the
gentleman
hastily
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
gave
the
old
fellow
sixpence
the
smallest
change
that
he
had
several
others
were
stopped
after
this
and
although
my
fellow
traveller
failed
to
sell
his
perishable
goods
a
number
of
people
assisted
him
with
coppers
in
one
instance
i
thought
he
surely
could
not
be
of
sound
mind
for
he
had
seen
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
seating
themselves
in
a
motor
car
and
was
hurrying
with
all
speed
in
that
direction
in
this
case
he
failed
at
getting
a
hearing
for
before
he
was
half
way
towards
them
the
party
had
seated
themselves
and
the
car
was
moving
rapidly
away
my
companion
lips
trembled
with
vexation
at
seeing
this
wait
a
moment
said
he
crossing
the
road
to
a
baker
shop
i
am
going
to
exchange
these
berries
for
buns
waiting
outside
i
was
soon
joined
again
by
this
strange
old
fellow
who
then
carried
in
his
left
hand
four
buns
his
right
hand
still
being
in
possession
of
the
blackberries
you
will
never
sell
them
i
said
if
you
do
not
offer
them
at
more
likely
places
see
there
is
a
shop
with
fruit
and
vegetables
try
there
why
he
answered
with
a
grin
how
do
you
think
i
could
make
a
living
if
i
sold
them
the
market
value
of
these
berries
is
about
one
farthing
and
it
takes
sixteen
farthings
to
pay
for
my
feather
bed
not
reckoning
scrand
food
and
a
glass
or
two
of
skimish
drink
in
fact
said
he
my
day
work
is
done
and
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
the
result
saying
which
he
tumbled
the
blackberries
into
the
gutter
and
placed
the
can
which
he
used
for
making
tea
into
a
large
inside
pocket
on
getting
a
better
view
of
them
i
remarked
that
no
person
could
buy
such
berries
for
they
were
about
the
worst
assortment
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
it
would
not
pay
to
make
them
very
enticing
said
he
or
they
would
find
a
too
ready
sale
but
what
do
you
do
when
the
season
is
over
i
asked
for
you
can
not
pick
blackberries
all
the
year
round
oh
he
answered
i
have
other
ways
of
making
a
living
if
i
can
get
a
good
audience
in
a
public
house
i
can
often
make
a
day
living
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
several
drinks
in
the
bargain
what
by
singing
or
dancing
i
asked
no
said
he
but
by
reciting
listen
to
this
with
that
he
began
to
recite
a
long
poem
line
after
line
until
i
began
to
hope
his
memory
would
fail
him
what
a
memory
it
was
hundreds
of
lines
without
a
break
when
he
came
to
the
most
dramatic
parts
he
paused
for
action
and
i
knew
that
he
was
heedless
of
the
approach
of
night
and
had
forgotten
that
bedford
was
still
afar
off
there
was
now
no
stopping
of
him
poem
after
poem
he
recited
and
he
introduced
his
subjects
with
little
speeches
that
were
so
different
from
his
ordinary
conversation
that
it
was
apparent
that
he
had
committed
them
also
to
memory
for
the
benefit
of
a
fit
audience
if
he
was
so
zealous
after
a
weary
day
walk
and
without
stimulants
what
would
he
be
under
the
influence
of
several
glasses
of
strong
ale
i
shuddered
to
think
of
it
we
were
now
about
a
mile
from
bedford
and
my
companion
had
for
the
last
hour
been
reciting
as
for
myself
i
was
travelling
alone
for
i
had
forgotten
him
sometimes
to
my
confusion
he
would
startle
me
by
a
sudden
question
but
seeing
that
he
made
no
pause
for
an
answer
i
soon
understood
that
no
answer
was
required
of
me
for
that
he
was
still
reciting
as
we
entered
the
outskirts
of
bedford
my
companion
found
it
necessary
owing
to
increase
of
traffic
to
raise
his
voice
which
he
continued
to
do
until
at
last
the
traffic
became
so
very
great
that
he
could
not
make
himself
heard
i
had
not
heard
his
voice
for
the
last
five
minutes
when
he
suddenly
clutched
my
shoulder
and
demanded
what
i
thought
of
that
you
have
a
wonderful
memory
i
said
oh
said
he
that
is
nothing
i
could
entertain
you
for
several
days
in
like
manner
with
fresh
matter
each
day
here
we
are
at
the
i
like
your
company
and
if
you
are
travelling
my
way
let
us
go
together
it
is
not
every
man
that
i
would
travel
with
two
days
in
succession
and
thought
i
it
is
not
every
man
would
travel
in
your
company
two
days
in
succession
which
way
are
you
going
i
asked
him
towards
northampton
said
he
alas
i
answered
my
direction
is
altogether
different
we
now
entered
the
cock
and
after
calling
for
two
glasses
of
ale
enquired
as
to
accommodation
for
travellers
which
we
were
informed
was
good
there
being
plenty
of
room
sometimes
if
ale
is
not
called
for
they
are
disinclined
to
letting
beds
especially
in
the
winter
when
they
find
so
little
difficulty
in
filling
the
house
on
entering
the
kitchen
we
found
it
occupied
by
a
number
of
men
some
of
whom
recognised
my
fellow
traveller
and
spoke
to
him
but
strange
to
say
although
this
man
had
proved
so
garrulous
with
one
for
a
companion
with
the
many
he
had
very
little
to
say
and
sat
in
a
corner
all
through
the
evening
smoking
in
silence
and
paying
no
heed
to
others
either
by
tongue
eye
or
ear
once
or
twice
i
saw
his
lips
move
when
filling
his
pipe
or
knocking
out
its
ashes
and
i
thought
that
he
was
perhaps
rehearsing
and
training
his
memory
for
the
following
day
in
case
he
would
be
again
fortunate
in
picking
up
with
an
easy
fool
like
myself
for
no
doubt
the
poor
old
fellow
had
been
often
commanded
to
desist
from
reciting
and
ordered
to
hell
by
impatient
and
unsympathetic
men
whom
he
had
at
first
mistaken
for
quiet
and
good
natured
companions
i
had
not
by
a
look
or
a
word
sought
to
offend
him
but
one
day
of
his
company
was
certainly
enough
chapter
xxx
the
fortune
it
is
not
unusual
to
read
of
cases
where
men
who
have
descended
to
the
lowest
forms
of
labour
aye
even
become
tramps
being
sought
and
found
as
heirs
to
fortunes
left
often
by
people
who
either
had
no
power
to
will
otherwise
or
whom
death
had
taken
unawares
therefore
when
one
fine
morning
a
cab
drove
up
to
a
which
was
also
a
tramps
lodging
house
and
a
well
dressed
gentleman
entered
and
enquired
of
the
landlord
for
a
man
named
james
macquire
the
landlord
at
once
pronounced
him
to
be
a
solicitor
in
quest
of
a
lost
heir
sir
said
he
we
do
not
take
the
names
of
our
lodgers
but
several
are
now
in
the
kitchen
james
macquire
you
said
on
receiving
answer
in
the
affirmative
the
landlord
at
once
visited
the
lodgers
kitchen
and
standing
at
the
door
enquired
in
a
very
respectable
manner
if
there
was
any
gentleman
present
by
the
name
of
macquire
whose
christian
name
was
james
at
which
a
delicate
looking
man
who
had
arrived
the
previous
night
sprang
quickly
to
his
feet
and
said
in
a
surprised
voice
that
is
my
name
well
said
the
landlord
a
gentleman
wishes
to
see
you
at
once
he
came
here
in
a
cab
and
for
your
sake
i
trust
my
surmises
are
right
with
the
exception
of
having
on
a
good
clean
white
shirt
the
man
macquire
was
ill
clad
and
he
looked
ruefully
at
his
clothes
and
then
at
the
landlord
please
ask
the
gentleman
to
wait
said
he
and
going
to
the
tap
began
to
wash
his
hands
and
face
after
which
he
carefully
combed
his
hair
the
strange
gentleman
was
seated
quietly
in
the
bar
when
the
man
macquire
presented
himself
and
the
landlord
was
engaged
in
washing
glasses
and
dusting
decanters
james
macquire
asked
the
gentleman
rising
and
addressing
the
one
in
a
respectful
manner
which
the
landlord
could
not
help
but
notice
that
is
my
name
answered
macquire
with
some
dignity
do
you
know
anything
of
frederick
macquire
of
doggery
hall
asked
the
gentleman
i
do
said
the
one
and
after
a
long
pause
and
seeming
to
give
the
information
with
much
reluctance
he
added
frederick
macquire
of
doggery
hall
is
my
uncle
several
other
questions
were
asked
and
answered
that
will
do
thank
you
said
the
gentleman
will
you
please
call
at
the
head
and
see
me
at
seven
you
have
been
advertised
for
since
the
death
of
frederick
macquire
some
weeks
ago
good
morning
he
said
shaking
james
macquire
by
the
hand
in
a
highly
respectful
manner
as
the
landlord
could
not
fail
to
see
totally
regardless
of
the
man
rags
the
one
stood
at
the
bar
speechless
apparently
absorbed
in
deep
thought
what
will
you
have
to
drink
asked
the
landlord
kindly
whisky
answered
macquire
in
a
faint
voice
after
drinking
this
and
another
he
seemed
to
recover
his
composure
and
said
to
the
landlord
i
am
at
present
as
you
must
know
penniless
and
you
would
greatly
oblige
me
by
the
loan
of
a
few
shillings
say
half
a
sovereign
until
i
draw
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
in
advance
whatever
i
receive
from
you
you
shall
have
a
receipt
and
although
nothing
is
said
about
interest
the
amount
owing
will
be
doubled
aye
trebled
you
may
rest
assured
of
that
for
i
never
forget
a
kindness
you
had
better
take
a
sovereign
said
the
landlord
and
of
course
the
will
supply
any
meals
you
may
need
and
drink
is
at
your
disposal
thank
you
said
macquire
in
a
choking
voice
let
me
have
a
couple
of
pots
of
your
best
ale
for
the
poor
fellows
in
the
kitchen
what
a
surprise
for
the
poor
lodgers
when
they
were
asked
to
drink
macquire
health
on
being
told
of
his
good
fortune
they
one
and
all
cheered
and
congratulated
him
but
the
easy
way
in
which
this
man
macquire
threw
his
weight
about
the
kitchen
and
for
that
matter
the
whole
house
was
extraordinary
now
it
happened
that
there
were
at
this
house
two
stonemasons
who
although
heavy
drinkers
had
been
working
steady
for
a
week
or
more
for
their
job
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
they
knew
not
how
many
idle
weeks
might
follow
these
men
were
at
breakfast
and
being
repeatedly
offered
drink
grew
careless
and
resolved
to
quit
work
there
and
then
and
draw
their
money
which
amounted
to
three
pounds
ten
shillings
between
them
macquire
favoured
this
resolution
and
said
he
before
your
money
is
spent
i
shall
have
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
at
my
disposal
the
landlord
was
present
at
the
passing
of
this
resolution
and
though
he
said
nothing
apparently
favoured
it
for
he
laughed
pleasantly
in
less
than
half
an
hour
macquire
and
the
two
stonemasons
were
back
in
the
lodging
house
kitchen
and
drinking
ale
as
fast
as
they
possibly
could
in
a
number
of
cases
the
former
received
money
from
his
new
friends
to
buy
the
beer
but
according
to
after
developments
he
must
have
pocketed
this
money
and
had
the
beer
entered
to
his
account
in
addition
to
that
which
he
fetched
of
his
own
accord
however
when
evening
came
macquire
though
seemingly
possessed
of
business
faculties
was
not
in
a
bodily
condition
to
keep
his
appointment
as
he
himself
confessed
he
was
drunk
in
the
legs
but
sober
in
the
brain
what
an
evening
we
had
not
one
man
in
the
house
retired
sober
and
the
kindness
of
the
one
brought
tears
into
a
number
of
eyes
for
he
made
the
stonemasons
spend
their
money
freely
and
he
made
the
landlord
fetch
pot
after
pot
and
all
he
did
in
the
way
of
payment
was
to
utter
that
name
grown
strangely
powerful
james
macquire
now
when
the
next
morning
came
there
seemed
to
be
a
suspicion
that
all
was
not
right
for
as
soon
as
james
macquire
put
in
an
appearance
one
of
the
stonemasons
abruptly
asked
when
he
intended
to
see
the
lawyer
at
this
moment
the
landlord
entered
and
though
he
had
not
heard
the
question
he
too
would
like
to
know
when
macquire
intended
seeing
his
lawyer
do
bother
me
said
macquire
you
see
what
a
state
i
am
in
trembling
after
drink
i
soon
put
you
right
said
the
landlord
leaving
the
kitchen
and
entering
the
bar
the
stonemasons
offered
their
future
benefactor
a
drink
of
beer
which
he
waved
aside
saying
that
he
must
first
have
a
short
drink
to
steady
his
stomach
you
do
mind
giving
me
a
saucerful
of
your
tea
said
macquire
to
me
for
i
was
then
at
breakfast
with
pleasure
said
i
and
filling
the
saucer
pushed
it
towards
him
thank
you
said
he
after
drinking
it
that
saucer
of
tea
has
cost
me
a
sovereign
nonsense
said
i
inwardly
pleased
it
is
of
no
value
whatever
have
you
any
tobacco
he
asked
at
this
question
one
of
the
stonemasons
in
fear
that
macquire
would
promise
me
more
money
sprang
forward
with
tobacco
i
am
not
asking
you
for
tobacco
said
macquire
slowly
but
am
asking
this
gentleman
this
was
said
in
such
a
way
as
could
not
give
offence
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
already
knew
that
the
stonemason
heart
was
good
but
that
he
felt
disposed
to
test
mine
and
if
he
found
it
generous
he
would
not
forget
me
when
he
came
into
his
estate
not
setting
great
value
on
a
pipeful
of
tobacco
i
offered
him
my
pouch
to
help
himself
after
he
had
filled
his
pipe
he
said
in
an
abrupt
manner
as
he
was
walking
towards
the
bar
please
remember
friend
i
am
five
pounds
in
your
debt
what
a
fine
fellow
he
is
said
the
stonemason
to
me
for
the
few
kindnesses
we
did
him
yesterday
he
has
promised
me
and
my
pal
twenty
pounds
each
out
of
his
first
advance
and
larger
sums
to
follow
at
this
moment
the
postman
entered
with
a
letter
addressed
to
james
macquire
esq
if
the
landlord
or
any
one
else
had
the
least
suspicion
earlier
in
the
morning
it
certainly
vanished
at
the
sight
of
this
letter
macquire
opened
the
letter
and
after
reading
it
passed
it
to
the
landlord
that
gentleman
face
beamed
with
satisfaction
although
it
was
but
an
ordinary
note
saying
that
the
lawyer
had
expected
macquire
the
night
previous
and
trusted
that
he
would
keep
the
appointment
at
the
same
hour
on
the
following
day
by
which
time
the
lawyer
would
be
able
to
advance
him
some
money
that
something
like
business
said
macquire
to
which
every
one
agreed
the
landlord
and
the
stonemasons
showing
the
most
approval
now
said
james
macquire
to
the
landlord
you
had
better
let
me
have
some
money
what
for
asked
that
gentleman
you
can
have
anything
that
you
require
as
i
told
you
before
just
for
my
own
satisfaction
said
macquire
i
am
going
to
walk
out
for
a
while
so
as
to
keep
myself
sober
for
business
you
ca
go
out
in
those
rags
said
the
landlord
you
had
better
take
my
best
suit
in
ten
minutes
or
less
the
one
was
standing
at
the
bar
in
the
landlord
best
suit
of
clothes
after
which
the
said
landlord
gave
him
all
the
money
available
amounting
to
thirty
shillings
how
much
am
i
in
your
debt
asked
macquire
oh
about
three
pounds
was
the
answer
we
will
call
it
fifty
pounds
cried
macquire
and
drinking
his
whisky
he
left
the
house
followed
closely
by
the
faithful
stonemasons
in
half
an
hour
the
stonemasons
were
back
having
lost
their
companion
in
the
market
place
and
were
at
the
bar
awaiting
him
thinking
he
might
have
already
returned
yes
and
they
could
wait
for
that
was
the
last
of
macquire
and
to
the
surprise
and
mortification
of
the
landlord
and
the
two
stonemasons
the
house
received
no
more
visits
or
letters
from
lawyers
chapter
xxxi
some
ways
of
making
a
living
no
doubt
laces
are
the
best
stock
to
carry
for
a
gross
of
them
can
be
had
for
eighteen
pence
sometimes
less
which
sold
at
a
penny
a
pair
realises
six
shillings
and
counting
the
number
of
pennies
that
are
tendered
free
in
pity
for
the
man
circumstances
who
must
be
cunning
enough
to
show
only
two
or
three
pairs
at
a
time
he
has
nothing
to
complain
of
in
the
end
although
he
sometimes
meets
a
lady
who
persists
in
regarding
him
as
a
trader
and
bargains
for
two
pairs
for
three
halfpence
and
ultimately
carries
them
off
in
triumph
in
spite
of
his
whine
of
not
being
able
to
make
bed
and
board
out
of
them
in
spite
of
these
rare
instances
he
must
confess
that
in
the
end
he
has
received
eight
or
nine
shillings
for
an
outlay
of
eighteen
pence
and
what
is
more
an
abundance
of
free
food
then
again
laces
are
light
they
are
easy
to
carry
and
can
be
stored
in
one
another
great
advantage
is
that
although
a
man
may
get
wet
through
or
roll
on
his
laces
in
the
grass
he
does
not
spoil
his
living
in
fact
if
they
become
crumpled
and
twisted
and
their
tags
rusty
he
makes
them
his
testimony
that
he
was
wet
through
being
out
all
night
which
story
rarely
fails
in
coppers
and
he
still
retains
his
laces
but
with
all
these
advantages
of
a
light
and
profitable
stock
there
are
two
men
who
scorn
to
carry
even
these
and
will
not
on
any
account
make
any
pretence
at
selling
these
two
men
are
the
gridler
and
the
downrighter
the
former
sings
hymns
in
the
streets
and
he
makes
his
living
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
professional
singers
are
paid
according
to
the
richness
sweetness
and
compass
of
their
voices
but
the
gridler
profit
increases
as
his
vocal
powers
decline
the
more
shaky
and
harsh
his
voice
becomes
the
greater
his
reward
with
a
tongue
like
a
rasp
he
smoothes
the
roughness
off
hard
hearts
with
a
voice
like
an
old
hen
he
ushers
in
the
golden
egg
with
a
base
mixture
of
treble
contralto
and
bass
he
produces
good
metal
which
falls
from
top
story
windows
or
is
thrown
from
front
doors
to
drop
at
his
feet
with
the
true
ring
then
if
the
voice
be
immaterial
where
lies
the
art
of
gridling
no
more
or
less
than
in
the
selection
of
hymns
which
must
be
simple
and
pathetic
and
familiar
to
all
let
the
gridler
supply
the
words
sufficiently
to
be
understood
and
the
simple
air
with
variations
a
good
gridler
often
misses
parts
of
the
air
itself
for
breathing
spells
and
in
stooping
for
coppers
let
him
supply
the
words
i
say
and
his
hearers
will
supply
the
feeling
for
instance
if
a
gridler
has
sung
an
old
well
known
hymn
fifty
or
sixty
times
a
day
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
he
can
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
affected
by
the
words
it
would
be
extremely
thoughtless
to
request
of
such
an
one
an
encore
without
giving
a
promise
of
further
reward
in
fact
this
man
is
really
so
weary
of
song
that
if
there
is
any
merry
making
at
the
lodging
house
he
is
the
one
man
who
will
not
sing
not
even
under
the
influence
of
drink
and
what
is
more
no
man
would
invite
him
for
being
a
gridler
and
earning
his
living
by
song
we
know
well
that
his
voice
is
spoilt
and
that
he
can
not
sing
the
gridler
considers
himself
to
be
at
the
top
of
the
begging
profession
for
his
stock
never
gets
low
nor
requires
replenishing
and
his
voice
is
only
a
little
weak
thing
of
no
weight
the
notes
of
which
are
born
into
the
world
from
his
throat
and
was
never
roused
from
sleep
in
the
depths
of
his
chest
there
is
no
strain
or
effort
in
giving
these
notes
to
the
world
despite
the
gridler
affectations
and
he
neither
grows
pale
nor
red
with
the
exertion
but
the
downrighter
not
only
scorns
grinders
pedlars
but
he
even
despises
the
gridler
for
being
a
hard
worker
i
says
he
do
not
carry
laces
needles
matches
or
anything
else
and
i
do
not
advertise
my
presence
to
the
police
by
singing
in
the
streets
if
people
are
not
in
the
front
of
the
house
i
seek
them
at
the
back
where
a
gridler
voice
may
not
reach
them
i
am
not
satisfied
with
getting
a
penny
for
a
farthing
pair
of
laces
i
get
the
whole
penny
for
nothing
people
never
mistake
me
for
a
trader
for
i
exhibit
no
wares
and
tell
them
straightforward
that
i
am
begging
the
price
of
my
supper
and
bed
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
all
these
men
have
different
ways
of
making
a
living
and
each
man
thinks
his
own
way
the
best
and
fears
to
make
new
experiments
such
an
opinion
being
good
for
the
trade
of
begging
sometimes
owing
to
the
vigilance
of
the
police
and
their
strict
laws
the
gridler
has
to
resort
to
downright
begging
but
his
heart
is
not
in
the
business
and
he
is
for
that
reason
unsuccessful
he
longs
to
get
in
some
quiet
side
street
where
he
can
chant
slowly
his
well
known
hymns
but
everything
is
in
favour
of
the
more
silent
downrighter
who
allows
nothing
to
escape
him
neither
stores
private
or
public
houses
nor
pedestrians
all
he
is
required
to
do
is
to
keep
himself
looking
something
like
a
working
man
and
he
receives
more
charity
in
the
alehouse
by
a
straightforward
appeal
as
an
unemployed
workman
than
another
who
wastes
his
time
in
giving
a
song
and
a
dance
people
often
hurry
past
when
they
hear
a
man
singing
or
see
one
approaching
with
matches
or
laces
but
the
downrighter
claims
their
attention
before
they
suspect
his
business
when
i
met
long
john
at
oxford
we
had
much
talk
of
the
merits
of
different
parts
of
a
beggar
profession
he
it
seemed
had
carried
laces
he
had
also
gridled
sacred
hymns
in
the
streets
and
sung
sporting
songs
in
the
alehouses
he
had
even
exerted
himself
as
a
dancer
but
said
he
i
must
confess
after
all
that
as
a
downrighter
my
profits
are
larger
at
the
expenditure
of
far
less
energy
in
the
course
of
conversation
long
john
informed
me
that
he
also
was
travelling
london
way
and
if
i
was
agreeable
we
would
start
together
on
the
following
morning
and
said
he
in
a
whisper
so
that
other
lodgers
might
not
hear
there
is
a
house
on
our
way
that
is
good
for
a
shilling
each
he
is
a
very
rich
man
and
has
been
an
officer
in
the
army
he
pretends
to
be
prejudiced
against
old
soldiers
and
when
they
appeal
to
him
he
first
abuses
them
after
which
he
drills
them
and
after
abusing
them
again
rewards
each
with
a
two
shilling
piece
do
you
know
the
drills
no
i
answered
i
have
never
been
in
the
army
that
is
a
great
pity
said
long
john
for
we
lose
a
shilling
each
however
we
will
not
say
that
we
are
old
soldiers
for
fear
of
losing
all
and
be
satisfied
with
the
two
shillings
between
us
so
it
was
agreed
in
less
than
two
hours
we
were
at
the
gentleman
lodge
passing
boldly
through
the
gates
we
followed
the
drive
until
we
saw
before
us
a
fine
large
mansion
reaching
the
front
door
we
rang
the
bell
which
was
soon
answered
by
a
servant
to
our
enquiries
as
to
whether
the
master
was
in
the
servant
replied
in
the
negative
but
intimated
that
the
mistress
was
of
course
this
made
not
the
least
difference
as
many
a
tramp
knew
except
that
had
we
been
old
soldiers
the
lady
not
being
able
to
test
us
by
drill
would
therefore
not
have
given
more
than
the
civilian
shilling
now
almost
unfortunately
for
us
the
downrighter
knowing
that
the
lady
would
not
drill
us
and
thinking
that
there
might
be
a
possibility
of
getting
the
double
pay
to
old
soldiers
without
danger
of
drill
or
cross
examination
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
to
say
that
we
were
two
old
soldiers
for
thought
he
if
it
does
no
good
it
can
not
do
any
harm
therefore
when
the
lady
appeared
smiling
at
the
door
long
john
being
spokesman
told
a
straightforward
tale
of
hardship
and
added
that
we
had
both
served
our
country
on
the
battlefield
as
soldiers
he
had
scarcely
mentioned
the
word
soldiers
when
a
loud
authoritative
voice
behind
us
cried
shoulder
arms
i
was
leaning
heavily
on
a
thick
stick
when
this
command
was
given
but
lost
my
balance
and
almost
fell
to
the
ground
we
both
turned
our
faces
towards
the
speaker
and
saw
a
tall
military
looking
gentleman
scrutinising
us
with
two
very
sharp
eyes
giving
us
but
very
little
time
to
compose
ourselves
he
shouted
again
present
arms
this
second
command
was
no
more
obeyed
than
the
first
long
john
blew
his
nose
and
i
stood
at
ease
on
my
staff
as
though
i
did
not
care
whether
the
dogs
were
set
upon
us
or
we
were
to
be
lodged
in
jail
after
another
uncomfortable
pause
the
retired
officer
said
looking
at
us
severely
two
old
soldiers
indeed
you
are
two
imposters
and
scoundrels
perhaps
you
understand
this
command
and
in
a
voice
fiercer
and
louder
than
ever
he
cried
quick
march
long
john
and
i
although
not
old
soldiers
certainly
understood
this
command
for
we
started
down
the
drive
at
a
good
pace
with
the
military
looking
gentleman
following
when
we
reached
the
public
road
he
gave
another
command
halt
but
this
was
another
of
those
commands
which
we
did
not
understand
however
on
its
being
repeated
less
sternly
we
obeyed
here
said
he
you
are
not
two
old
soldiers
but
you
may
not
be
altogether
scoundrels
and
i
never
turn
men
away
without
giving
them
some
assistance
saying
which
he
gave
us
a
shilling
each
but
what
a
narrow
escape
we
had
of
being
turned
penniless
away
all
through
long
john
greed
and
folly
chapter
xxxii
at
last
in
spite
of
these
occasional
successes
with
long
john
and
others
i
was
often
at
my
wits
ends
to
procure
food
and
shelter
this
always
happened
when
i
travelled
alone
i
was
now
heartily
sick
of
this
wandering
from
town
to
town
and
every
day
seemed
to
get
more
unfortunate
until
the
first
day
in
december
when
forced
by
extreme
want
i
resolved
to
enter
the
city
at
once
knowing
that
a
pound
was
already
there
waiting
my
pleasure
that
night
i
was
back
in
the
farmhouse
and
what
a
genial
spirit
seemed
to
animate
the
old
coke
fire
not
at
all
like
the
death
dealer
the
waster
of
time
who
robbed
a
human
being
of
his
energy
and
a
kitten
of
its
play
oh
no
for
this
one
night
we
were
the
best
of
friends
and
sunny
smiles
passed
between
us
until
bed
time
i
had
been
away
five
months
and
would
still
have
to
suffer
owing
to
this
early
return
knowing
that
i
would
not
have
courage
to
sell
in
the
streets
of
london
and
that
i
would
be
compelled
to
eke
out
a
living
on
five
shillings
a
week
until
the
beginning
of
the
new
year
this
being
a
half
crown
for
lodgings
and
the
same
for
food
i
was
very
well
satisfied
with
myself
at
this
time
with
the
prospect
of
the
new
year
before
me
and
at
once
began
to
get
my
work
ready
for
the
press
when
all
original
composition
was
done
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
ready
a
copy
for
the
printer
even
at
this
time
i
was
confronted
with
a
foolish
hindrance
one
library
in
lambeth
which
at
one
time
had
a
table
with
pens
ink
and
blotting
pads
for
the
convenience
of
visitors
had
had
these
things
removed
but
seeing
no
sign
to
the
contrary
i
still
thought
i
would
be
allowed
to
take
possession
of
a
corner
of
this
table
and
write
providing
i
supplied
my
own
material
so
this
library
was
chosen
for
my
week
writing
but
i
was
warned
off
at
the
commencement
thoroughly
incensed
at
this
fresh
and
paltry
hindrance
i
sought
a
library
where
i
knew
my
work
could
be
continued
without
interference
even
if
the
writing
of
it
took
some
years
this
library
was
not
so
convenient
as
the
other
being
some
distance
away
but
there
i
at
last
succeeded
in
performing
my
task
now
came
the
new
year
when
independent
of
others
i
would
be
enabled
to
assist
myself
if
i
failed
in
making
success
the
disappointment
would
be
mine
only
and
if
i
succeeded
there
would
be
none
other
to
thank
but
myself
on
receiving
this
money
in
the
first
week
in
january
i
lost
no
time
in
seeing
the
printer
and
arranging
for
an
edition
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
copies
the
cost
to
be
nineteen
pounds
this
amount
certainly
did
not
cover
expenses
and
here
began
the
series
of
kindnesses
which
after
a
few
more
disappointments
were
to
follow
this
printer
placed
the
in
the
hands
of
a
good
reader
and
that
gentleman
was
put
to
considerable
trouble
being
baffled
and
interested
in
turns
the
last
two
lines
of
a
poem
entitled
the
hill
side
park
are
entirely
his
both
in
thought
and
expression
i
mention
this
because
two
or
three
correspondents
liked
the
poem
in
question
and
one
thought
the
last
two
lines
the
best
so
i
take
this
opportunity
to
clear
my
conscience
there
was
nothing
to
complain
of
both
printer
and
reader
being
at
great
pains
and
patience
to
make
the
work
better
than
it
was
naturally
i
thought
if
there
was
any
interest
shown
it
would
not
be
in
the
author
personality
but
in
the
work
itself
and
for
this
reason
gave
the
farmhouse
a
common
lodging
house
as
my
address
i
was
under
the
impression
that
people
would
uninterestedly
think
the
farmhouse
to
be
a
small
printing
establishment
or
a
small
publishing
concern
of
which
they
had
not
heard
to
which
they
would
forward
their
orders
and
business
would
be
transacted
without
their
being
any
the
wiser
in
the
first
week
in
march
i
received
my
first
printed
copy
the
printer
had
sent
thirty
copies
or
more
to
the
various
papers
and
i
was
now
waiting
the
result
which
at
last
came
in
the
shape
of
two
very
slim
reviews
from
the
north
a
yorkshire
paper
saying
that
the
work
had
rhymes
that
were
neither
intricate
nor
original
and
a
scotch
paper
saying
that
the
work
was
perfect
in
craftsmanship
rather
than
inspired
this
was
very
disappointing
more
so
to
know
that
others
who
were
powerless
to
assist
me
were
interesting
themselves
on
my
behalf
although
i
still
had
confidence
that
the
work
contained
some
good
things
i
began
to
think
that
there
must
be
some
glaring
faults
which
made
the
book
as
a
whole
impossible
to
review
this
first
thought
became
my
first
belief
when
other
notices
did
not
follow
weeks
and
weeks
went
by
and
having
now
started
to
drink
and
losing
control
of
my
will
in
this
disappointment
i
had
come
down
to
my
last
ten
shillings
and
had
a
good
seven
months
to
go
before
my
money
was
again
due
first
of
all
i
had
serious
thoughts
of
destroying
this
work
the
whole
two
hundred
and
odd
copies
which
were
under
lock
and
key
in
my
room
and
to
then
set
to
work
carefully
on
new
matter
and
when
my
income
was
again
due
to
again
mortgage
it
in
another
attempt
being
very
impulsive
this
no
doubt
would
have
been
there
and
then
commenced
had
i
not
been
confronted
with
the
difficulty
of
doing
so
there
was
only
one
way
of
doing
this
properly
and
that
was
by
fire
which
would
require
privacy
my
room
was
the
only
place
where
i
could
do
this
without
being
seen
but
that
contained
neither
stove
nor
grate
and
even
if
it
had
two
hundred
books
would
take
a
number
of
sleepless
nights
to
render
into
ashes
i
thought
with
some
bitterness
of
having
to
go
on
tramp
again
and
it
was
in
one
of
these
bitter
moments
that
i
swore
a
great
oath
that
these
copies
good
or
bad
should
maintain
me
until
the
end
of
the
year
for
i
would
distribute
the
books
here
and
there
sending
them
to
successful
people
and
they
would
probably
pay
for
their
copies
perhaps
not
so
much
for
what
merit
they
might
think
the
work
contained
as
for
the
sake
of
circumstances
this
idea
no
sooner
possessed
me
than
i
began
preparing
for
its
execution
for
this
purpose
i
obtained
stamps
and
envelopes
and
six
copies
were
at
once
posted
the
result
was
seen
in
a
couple
of
days
three
letters
two
containing
the
price
of
the
book
and
the
third
from
the
charity
organisation
the
latter
writing
on
behalf
of
a
gentleman
who
had
become
interested
and
would
like
to
come
to
my
assistance
remembering
these
people
in
the
past
through
my
former
experience
with
them
i
had
no
great
hopes
at
the
present
time
in
spite
of
the
kind
hearted
interest
of
the
gentleman
in
question
however
i
called
on
them
the
next
morning
and
after
the
usual
long
wait
in
a
side
room
which
i
believe
is
not
through
any
great
stress
of
business
but
so
as
to
bring
one
heart
down
to
the
freezing
point
of
abject
misery
and
to
extinguish
one
by
one
his
many
hopes
after
this
weary
waiting
i
received
an
interview
there
is
not
sufficient
venom
in
my
disposition
to
allow
me
to
describe
this
meeting
in
words
fit
and
bitter
for
its
need
this
life
is
too
short
to
enable
me
to
recover
from
my
astonishment
which
will
fill
me
for
a
good
many
years
to
come
the
questions
and
answers
which
had
passed
between
us
on
our
former
interview
two
years
previous
were
now
before
them
but
they
questioned
again
in
the
same
strain
and
my
answers
corresponded
with
those
of
the
past
for
i
told
no
lies
apparently
they
had
no
chance
here
so
they
came
at
once
to
the
business
in
hand
you
have
written
to
a
gentleman
asking
for
his
assistance
not
liking
this
way
of
explaining
my
conduct
i
said
no
not
exactly
that
but
have
been
trying
to
sell
him
some
work
that
i
had
done
it
seemed
that
they
knew
nothing
of
this
work
or
that
it
better
suited
their
purpose
to
appear
ignorant
so
it
was
necessary
to
give
them
the
full
particulars
was
not
the
book
a
success
they
asked
not
caring
to
admit
failure
and
still
thinking
the
work
worthy
of
a
little
success
i
answered
not
yet
but
it
is
too
early
to
judge
it
as
a
failure
then
i
gave
it
in
confidence
that
a
gentleman
well
known
in
southwark
and
who
often
wrote
articles
on
literary
subjects
had
promised
to
review
it
in
one
of
the
evening
papers
which
might
lead
to
other
notices
what
is
the
name
of
this
gentleman
the
name
was
at
once
mentioned
for
there
was
no
reason
that
i
knew
of
to
withhold
it
but
instead
of
this
name
doing
me
good
as
i
then
expected
it
probably
made
this
case
of
mine
more
unfavorable
for
i
have
been
told
since
that
this
gentleman
had
more
than
once
attacked
the
ways
and
methods
of
this
organisation
both
on
the
public
platform
and
through
the
press
not
knowing
this
at
that
time
i
thought
it
extremely
fortunate
to
be
enabled
to
mention
the
favour
of
such
a
well
known
local
man
all
went
smoothly
for
a
while
although
i
could
plainly
see
that
these
people
did
not
recognise
the
writing
of
books
as
work
and
were
plainly
disgusted
at
the
folly
of
sacrificing
an
income
to
that
end
their
next
question
confirmed
this
opinion
do
you
ever
do
anything
for
a
living
i
mentioned
that
i
had
tramped
the
country
as
a
hawker
during
the
previous
summer
but
had
suffered
through
want
of
courage
could
not
make
anything
like
a
living
and
was
often
in
want
and
without
shelter
there
was
a
rather
long
pause
and
the
charity
organisation
rose
slowly
to
their
feet
and
said
davies
do
you
really
expect
this
gentleman
who
has
written
to
us
to
maintain
you
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
you
what
was
the
matter
with
me
did
not
seem
to
escape
many
people
and
it
was
most
certainly
noted
by
the
smallest
toddler
that
played
in
the
street
but
the
charity
organisation
did
not
think
proper
to
recognise
any
other
than
an
able
man
strong
in
the
use
of
all
his
limbs
no
said
these
people
you
must
do
the
same
as
you
did
last
summer
which
in
other
words
was
go
on
tramp
starve
and
be
shelterless
as
you
were
before
and
then
in
the
deep
silence
which
followed
for
i
was
speechless
with
indignation
a
voice
soft
and
low
but
emphatic
and
significant
said
we
strongly
advise
you
to
do
this
but
you
really
must
not
write
any
more
begging
letters
davies
we
do
not
consider
ourselves
justified
in
putting
your
case
before
the
committee
that
ended
the
interview
and
i
left
them
with
the
one
sarcastic
remark
which
i
could
not
keep
unsaid
that
i
had
not
come
there
with
any
great
hopes
of
receiving
benefit
and
that
i
was
not
leaving
greatly
disappointed
at
this
result
these
people
passed
judgment
in
a
few
minutes
and
were
so
confident
that
they
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
call
at
the
farmhouse
for
the
opinion
of
a
man
who
had
known
me
for
a
considerable
time
no
doubt
they
had
made
another
mistake
for
some
time
before
this
an
old
pensioner
an
old
lodger
of
the
farmhouse
had
interviewed
these
people
telling
them
a
story
of
poverty
and
of
starving
wife
and
children
the
story
was
a
fabrication
from
beginning
to
end
yet
they
assisted
this
man
on
his
bare
word
to
the
extent
of
ten
shillings
so
as
to
enable
him
to
lie
about
the
farmhouse
drunk
for
several
days
then
some
days
after
this
the
charity
organisation
called
at
the
farmhouse
to
see
the
manager
and
to
make
enquiries
of
this
man
whom
they
had
so
mysteriously
befriended
what
cried
that
gentleman
you
have
assisted
this
drunken
fellow
on
his
bare
word
and
when
i
send
cases
to
you
that
i
know
are
deserving
you
sternly
refuse
to
entertain
them
perhaps
it
was
this
instance
fresh
in
their
minds
which
gave
them
an
idea
that
no
good
could
come
out
of
the
farmhouse
yet
as
far
as
my
experience
goes
the
object
of
these
people
was
not
so
much
to
do
good
but
to
prevent
good
from
being
done
for
here
for
the
second
time
they
stepped
between
me
and
one
who
might
have
rendered
me
some
aid
what
i
found
the
most
distasteful
part
of
their
system
was
the
way
in
which
they
conceal
the
name
of
a
benefactor
i
had
sent
six
books
three
to
men
and
three
to
women
one
man
had
replied
with
a
kind
encouraging
letter
and
the
price
of
the
book
enclosed
and
one
of
the
two
others
had
written
to
the
organisation
but
on
no
account
would
they
mention
his
name
now
when
these
people
answer
a
letter
of
enquiry
they
have
no
other
option
than
to
say
one
of
two
things
either
that
the
applicant
is
an
impostor
and
deserves
no
notice
or
that
the
case
is
genuine
and
deserving
consideration
they
of
course
answered
in
the
former
strain
withholding
the
name
so
as
to
leave
no
opportunity
to
vindicate
one
character
the
interference
of
these
people
put
me
on
my
mettle
and
i
was
determined
not
to
follow
their
advice
and
tramp
through
another
hard
winter
i
had
something
like
three
shillings
at
the
time
of
this
interview
so
buying
two
shillings
worth
of
stamps
i
posted
a
dozen
books
that
very
night
being
still
warm
with
resentment
the
result
of
these
were
four
kind
letters
each
containing
the
price
of
the
book
only
one
or
two
were
returned
to
me
whether
purchased
or
not
which
was
done
at
my
own
wish
before
i
again
became
penniless
off
went
another
dozen
in
this
way
i
disposed
of
some
sixty
copies
with
more
or
less
success
some
of
these
well
known
people
receiving
the
book
as
an
unacknowledged
gift
and
others
quickly
forwarding
the
price
of
the
same
the
strangest
part
of
this
experience
was
this
that
people
from
whom
i
expected
sympathy
having
seen
their
names
so
often
mentioned
as
champions
of
unfortunate
cases
received
the
book
as
a
gift
whilst
others
from
whom
i
had
less
hope
because
they
appeared
sarcastic
and
unfeeling
in
their
writings
returned
the
price
of
the
work
the
manager
was
astonished
at
my
receiving
no
answer
from
two
or
three
well
known
people
whom
he
had
recommended
at
last
after
disposing
of
sixty
copies
in
this
way
two
well
known
writers
corresponded
with
me
one
of
whom
i
saw
personally
and
they
both
promised
to
do
something
through
the
press
relying
on
these
promises
i
sent
away
no
more
copies
being
enabled
to
wait
a
week
or
two
owing
to
the
kindness
of
a
playwriter
an
irishman
as
to
whose
mental
qualification
the
world
is
divided
but
whose
heart
is
unquestionably
great
private
recognition
was
certainly
not
long
forthcoming
which
was
soon
followed
by
a
notice
in
a
leading
daily
paper
and
in
a
literary
paper
of
the
same
week
these
led
to
others
to
interviews
and
a
kindness
that
more
than
made
amends
for
past
indifference
it
was
all
like
a
dream
in
my
most
conceited
moments
i
had
not
expected
such
an
amount
of
praise
and
they
gathered
in
favour
as
they
came
until
one
wave
came
stronger
than
the
others
and
threw
me
breathless
of
all
conceit
for
i
felt
myself
unworthy
of
it
and
of
the
wonderful
sea
on
which
i
had
embarked
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
and
new
work
was
impossible
what
surprised
me
agreeably
was
the
reticence
of
my
fellow
lodgers
who
all
knew
but
mentioned
nothing
in
my
hearing
that
was
in
any
way
disconcerting
they
were
perhaps
a
little
less
familiar
but
showed
not
the
least
disrespect
in
their
reserve
as
would
most
certainly
have
been
the
case
if
i
had
succeeded
to
a
peerage
or
an
immense
fortune
the
lines
on
irish
tim
which
were
several
times
quoted
were
a
continual
worry
to
me
thinking
some
of
the
more
waggish
lodgers
would
bring
them
to
his
notice
poor
tim
no
doubt
would
have
sulked
resenting
this
publicity
but
if
the
truth
were
known
i
would
as
soon
do
tim
a
good
turn
as
any
other
man
in
the
farmhouse
boozy
bob
i
suppose
had
been
shown
his
name
in
print
but
bob
thought
it
a
great
honour
to
be
called
boozy
so
when
he
stood
drunk
before
me
with
his
face
beaming
with
smiles
of
gratitude
for
making
use
of
his
name
at
the
same
time
saying
good
evening
davies
how
are
you
i
at
once
understood
the
meaning
of
this
unusual
civility
and
we
both
fell
but
nothing
more
was
said
what
a
lot
of
decent
honest
fellows
these
were
you
must
not
be
surprised
said
a
gentleman
to
me
at
that
time
to
meet
less
sincere
men
than
these
in
other
walks
of
life
i
shall
consider
myself
fortunate
in
not
doing
so
chapter
xxxiii
success
however
much
cause
i
may
have
at
some
future
date
to
complain
of
severe
criticism
i
have
certainly
no
complaint
up
to
the
present
against
any
connected
with
the
making
of
books
some
half
a
dozen
lines
of
work
were
submitted
to
publishers
and
three
times
i
received
letters
with
a
view
to
publication
which
of
course
failed
through
the
want
of
friends
to
assist
me
knowing
how
rough
and
unequal
the
work
was
and
that
critics
could
find
if
so
inclined
plenty
to
justify
extreme
severity
has
undeceived
me
as
to
my
former
unreasonable
opinion
that
critics
were
more
prone
to
cavil
than
to
praise
i
would
like
it
to
be
understood
that
i
say
this
without
bidding
for
any
future
indulgence
for
i
am
thankful
to
any
man
who
will
show
me
my
faults
and
am
always
open
to
advice
as
i
have
said
the
first
notice
appeared
in
a
leading
daily
paper
a
full
column
in
which
i
saw
myself
described
a
rough
sketch
of
the
ups
and
downs
of
my
life
in
short
telling
sentences
with
quotations
from
my
work
the
effect
of
this
was
almost
instantaneous
for
correspondence
immediately
followed
letters
came
by
every
post
of
course
all
my
thoughts
had
been
concentrated
on
the
reading
world
so
that
i
was
much
surprised
when
two
young
men
came
to
the
house
and
requested
a
photo
for
an
illustrated
paper
i
could
not
oblige
them
at
that
moment
but
with
a
heart
overflowing
with
gratitude
was
persuaded
to
accompany
them
at
once
to
the
nearest
photographer
now
that
interest
was
at
its
high
point
now
said
one
of
these
young
men
when
i
was
on
my
way
with
them
delighted
with
this
mission
now
if
you
could
give
me
a
few
lines
on
the
war
in
the
east
to
go
with
your
photograph
it
would
be
of
much
greater
interest
to
the
public
not
caring
to
blow
the
froth
off
my
mind
in
this
indifferent
manner
and
feeling
too
conscientious
to
take
advantage
of
public
interest
by
writing
in
such
haste
which
to
tell
the
truth
appeared
a
difficult
task
i
quickly
turned
the
subject
to
other
matters
thinking
he
would
soon
forget
his
request
but
it
was
of
no
use
for
every
other
step
or
two
he
wanted
to
be
informed
whether
i
was
concentrating
my
mind
on
the
war
at
last
being
under
the
impression
that
my
natural
reserve
and
feeble
attempts
at
conversation
would
lead
him
to
believe
that
something
was
being
done
in
that
direction
i
made
a
great
effort
to
become
voluble
and
i
believe
succeeded
until
the
photograph
was
taken
when
i
left
him
his
last
question
was
what
about
the
war
the
next
morning
after
the
last
mentioned
episode
being
sunday
i
was
enjoying
a
stroll
through
the
city
which
is
so
very
quiet
on
this
one
morning
of
the
week
and
was
thinking
of
nothing
else
but
my
own
affairs
more
especially
of
the
photo
that
was
soon
to
appear
the
street
was
forsaken
with
the
exception
yes
there
they
were
two
men
with
a
camera
and
both
of
them
looking
my
way
anxiously
awaiting
my
approach
this
i
said
to
myself
is
fame
with
a
vengeance
i
felt
a
little
mortification
at
being
expected
to
undergo
this
operation
in
the
public
streets
one
of
these
photographers
quickly
stepped
forward
to
meet
me
and
smiling
blandly
requested
me
kindly
to
stand
for
a
moment
where
i
was
it
certainly
shocked
and
mortified
me
more
to
learn
that
they
desired
to
photograph
an
old
fashioned
dwelling
of
brick
and
mortar
and
that
they
considered
my
presence
as
no
adornment
to
the
front
a
few
days
after
this
first
review
a
critic
of
fine
literature
who
had
interested
himself
privately
on
my
behalf
sent
a
notice
to
a
weekly
literary
paper
and
it
was
the
respect
due
to
this
man
name
that
drew
the
attention
of
some
other
papers
of
good
standing
for
their
representatives
mentioned
this
man
name
with
every
respect
knowing
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
not
waste
his
hours
on
what
was
absolutely
worthless
what
kind
hearted
correspondents
i
had
and
what
offers
they
made
what
questions
they
asked
and
all
of
them
received
grateful
answers
with
one
exception
this
gentleman
who
did
not
require
a
book
presumably
being
more
interested
in
the
strange
conditions
under
which
i
had
lived
and
worked
offered
me
a
pleasant
home
in
the
country
where
i
could
cultivate
my
talents
surrounded
with
a
little
more
comfort
and
quieter
scenes
the
letter
was
long
delightful
poetical
and
worked
warmly
on
my
imagination
sentence
for
sentence
until
the
last
sentence
came
like
a
douche
of
cold
water
on
a
warm
body
of
course
finished
this
gentleman
it
is
necessary
to
supply
me
with
strict
references
as
to
honesty
and
respectability
where
was
i
to
get
these
after
having
failed
to
get
a
library
form
signed
which
would
entitle
me
to
borrow
books
no
doubt
the
manager
of
the
farmhouse
would
have
willingly
done
the
latter
as
was
afterwards
done
by
him
but
i
was
then
under
the
impression
that
the
keeper
of
a
lodging
house
was
ineligible
for
such
a
purpose
knowing
this
to
have
been
the
case
elsewhere
where
could
i
obtain
these
references
seeing
that
i
knew
no
one
who
would
take
the
responsibility
of
doing
such
a
petty
kindness
as
signing
a
library
form
this
gentleman
letter
i
need
scarcely
say
remained
unanswered
for
which
i
believe
none
will
blame
me
several
other
letters
were
received
which
i
found
extremely
difficult
to
answer
one
addressed
me
familiarly
in
rhyme
beginning
dear
brother
poet
brother
will
and
went
on
to
propose
that
we
two
should
take
a
firm
stand
together

to
the
everlasting
benefit
of
poetry
and
posterity
another
had
written
verse
and
would
be
glad
to
find
a
publisher
and
another
could
and
would
do
me
many
a
good
turn
if
i
felt
inclined
to
correct
his
work
and
to
add
lines
here
and
there
as
needed
not
for
a
moment
would
i
hold
these
people
to
ridicule
but
it
brought
to
mind
that
i
was
without
a
publisher
for
my
own
work
and
i
believed
in
all
sincerity
that
better
work
than
mine
might
go
begging
as
it
often
had
in
the
main
my
correspondents
were
kind
sympathetic
and
sensible
making
genuine
offers
of
assistance
for
which
i
thanked
them
with
all
my
heart
but
thought
myself
now
beyond
the
necessity
of
accepting
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
one
man
in
a
common
lodging
house
is
supposed
to
be
regarded
with
any
special
favour
the
common
kitchen
is
his
library
his
dining
room
and
his
parlour
and
better
accommodation
can
not
be
expected
at
the
low
price
of
fourpence
per
night
we
are
all
equal
without
a
question
of
what
a
man
past
may
have
been
or
what
his
future
is
likely
to
realise
any
man
who
puts
on
superior
airs
is
invariably
subjected
to
this
sarcastic
enquiry
how
much
do
you
pay
or
the
incontrovertible
remark
that
one
man
fourpence
is
as
good
as
another
the
manager
has
to
use
great
tact
in
not
indulging
in
too
long
a
conversation
with
one
particular
man
and
a
lodger
must
not
jeopardise
his
popularity
by
an
overweening
anxiety
to
exchange
civilities
or
to
repose
confidence
in
those
who
are
in
authority
for
these
lodgers
are
in
general
distrustful
and
suspicious
if
a
fish
porter
a
good
number
of
these
men
were
here
was
warned
after
any
misconduct
he
would
turn
to
one
of
his
pals
and
say
billingsgate
i
see
is
not
favoured
in
this
place
and
if
a
of
which
there
were
about
an
equal
number
was
called
to
account
in
the
same
way
his
remark
would
be
that
had
he
been
a
fish
porter
the
misconduct
would
have
been
overlooked
such
was
the
state
of
feeling
in
the
farmhouse
although
the
caretaker
time
after
time
almost
daily
reiterated
the
remark
that
one
man
was
as
good
as
another
and
that
no
distinction
was
made
between
the
two
classes
knowing
this
state
of
feeling
and
the
distrust
and
jealousy
of
these
honest
fellows
it
was
no
wonder
that
i
felt
a
little
awkward
at
the
change
of
circumstances
for
after
all
i
was
still
a
lodger
and
paying
no
more
than
them
for
the
same
conveniences
in
spite
of
this
i
believe
i
suffered
the
least
in
popularity
when
the
manager
determined
that
i
should
not
suffer
any
longer
for
want
of
privacy
to
pursue
my
aims
threw
open
his
own
private
rooms
for
my
convenience
and
every
time
i
took
advantage
of
his
kindness
the
manager
wife
would
take
advantage
of
this
by
supplying
a
hot
dinner
or
tea
as
the
hour
might
be
so
that
my
studies
might
not
be
interrupted
or
food
postponed
through
an
anxiety
to
perform
a
certain
task
the
manager
was
astonished
at
my
success
and
after
he
had
read
several
notices
it
certainly
must
have
made
him
bitter
against
those
whom
he
had
approached
on
my
behalf
yes
he
said
i
must
confess
to
failure
in
your
case
and
i
am
left
wondering
as
to
what
kind
of
cases
these
people
consider
worthy
of
assistance
the
man
being
in
a
subordinate
position
dare
not
openly
speak
his
thoughts
or
appear
to
force
the
hands
of
those
rich
visitors
but
he
certainly
lost
no
opportunity
in
showing
some
honest
irish
blood
in
his
references
to
the
charity
organisation
miss
so
and
so
has
been
here
said
he
one
morning
and
i
lost
no
time
in
relating
your
experience
with
the
charity
organisation
she
was
very
much
offended
and
shocked
and
she
has
now
gone
there
to
seek
some
explanation
as
for
that
i
answered
knowing
these
people
had
all
the
power
to
make
good
their
own
case
and
that
i
would
not
be
called
upon
to
sift
the
false
from
the
true
as
for
that
this
lady
will
return
satisfied
as
you
will
see
the
manager
did
not
altogether
believe
this
saying
that
he
thought
the
lady
in
question
was
not
a
blind
believer
in
anything
and
had
an
unusual
amount
of
common
sense
she
certainly
did
return
satisfied
saying
that
she
thought
they
were
justified
in
their
conduct
to
a
certain
extent
on
being
questioned
by
the
manager
who
claimed
it
justice
that
the
truth
should
be
known
she
said
that
she
dare
not
make
public
the
sayings
and
doings
of
the
society
i
am
now
giving
my
experiences
honestly
and
truthfully
and
thought
for
thought
if
not
word
for
word
as
they
happened
as
a
man
whose
ambition
above
all
other
things
is
to
impress
every
one
favourably
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
my
work
has
been
praised
far
more
than
its
worth
owing
to
having
met
the
writers
of
some
of
those
articles
and
impressing
them
in
a
simple
honest
way
i
am
writing
these
experiences
with
a
full
knowledge
of
human
nature
knowing
that
many
people
will
remark
take
no
heed
of
that
man
for
he
has
not
a
good
word
for
any
one
or
anything
but
as
far
as
my
knowledge
and
experience
goes
it
is
the
truth
and
if
that
seems
false
and
sensational
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
certainly
i
have
led
a
worthless
wandering
and
lazy
life
with
in
my
early
days
a
strong
dislike
to
continued
labour
and
incapacitated
from
the
same
in
later
years
no
person
seemed
inclined
to
start
me
on
the
road
to
fame
but
as
soon
as
i
had
made
an
audacious
step
or
two
i
was
taken
up
passed
quickly
on
from
stage
to
stage
and
given
free
rides
farther
than
i
expected
chapter
xxxiv
a
house
to
let
apparently
the
ill
luck
which
had
pursued
me
so
close
in
the
past
would
not
let
me
escape
without
another
scratch
in
my
pleasant
walks
in
my
native
town
my
eye
happened
to
fall
on
a
beautiful
house
untenanted
in
a
neighbourhood
so
quiet
that
every
other
house
seemed
to
be
the
same
the
very
name
woodland
road
was
an
address
for
a
poet
it
was
a
four
storied
villa
standing
on
the
top
of
a
hilly
road
from
where
one
could
see
on
a
clear
mistless
day
the
meeting
of
the
severn
and
the
bristol
channel
and
looking
in
another
direction
could
see
the
whole
town
without
hearing
one
of
its
many
voices
unfortunately
i
coveted
this
house
as
a
tenant
thinking
to
get
more
pleasure
in
one
glance
from
its
top
window
on
a
bright
morning
than
from
the
perusal
of
many
books
even
now
in
winter
it
presented
a
warm
comfortable
appearance
with
its
evergreens
and
its
ivied
walls
a
tall
spreading
rose
bush
stood
facing
its
lowest
window
and
i
imagined
the
bashful
red
roses
looking
in
at
me
as
though
i
would
not
come
out
of
doors
to
please
them
there
were
primrose
leaves
green
on
the
rockery
and
one
yellow
flower
still
stood
withered
and
bent
in
this
last
week
of
november
there
was
also
an
apple
tree
and
a
pear
tree
so
that
the
front
of
the
house
was
both
a
park
and
an
orchard
blackbirds
robins
and
thrushes
visited
the
grounds
daily
and
i
believe
that
this
house
was
their
nearest
approach
to
town
it
only
wanted
a
few
touches
of
spring
and
here
were
shady
nooks
and
leafy
boughs
for
birds
to
sing
unseeing
and
unseen
thinking
that
this
beautiful
place
would
not
remain
untenanted
for
long
i
at
once
made
application
being
recommended
by
my
old
master
of
the
days
of
my
apprenticeship
had
i
known
that
the
house
was
always
empty
and
untenanted
and
that
people
came
and
went
at
short
notice
i
should
certainly
not
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
take
possession
in
spite
of
its
natural
beauties
it
was
neither
haunted
by
ghosts
nor
animal
noises
but
by
the
landlady
who
lived
in
the
next
house
this
lady
i
did
not
see
nor
have
i
seen
her
up
to
the
present
time
one
of
my
family
having
taken
the
place
in
my
name
probably
if
i
had
transacted
business
personally
and
had
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
this
landlady
face
i
had
not
coveted
the
house
and
according
to
a
right
judgment
of
human
nature
would
have
saved
myself
the
money
and
disappointment
that
was
to
follow
however
the
house
became
mine
and
i
received
the
key
which
was
to
let
me
possess
this
house
and
its
interesting
grounds
i
idled
a
week
about
town
descanting
with
great
pleasure
on
the
beauties
of
my
future
home
but
i
was
somewhat
taken
by
surprise
at
the
unfavourable
reception
with
which
my
news
was
received
who
is
the
landlady
asked
one
s
i
answered
she
lives
next
door
it
is
very
unfortunate
said
this
person
that
the
landlady
lives
next
door
every
one
can
please
themselves
said
another
but
as
for
myself
i
would
never
dream
of
living
next
door
to
my
landlady
what
cried
another
the
landlady
lives
next
door
what
a
great
pity
to
be
sure
although
the
last
named
depreciator
was
the
respectable
wife
of
a
retired
tradesman
and
had
given
her
own
landlady
satisfaction
for
a
number
of
years
in
spite
of
this
i
was
highly
amused
at
these
remarks
taking
the
uncharitable
view
that
these
people
were
really
not
so
respectable
as
they
seemed
and
would
not
be
allowed
to
live
under
the
watchful
eyes
of
a
particular
person
my
landlady
i
thought
be
she
ever
so
watchful
dare
not
interfere
without
some
cause
and
as
the
house
must
needs
be
kept
very
quiet
for
my
own
purpose
of
study
noises
that
are
not
allowed
to
reach
me
in
the
same
house
surely
will
not
be
able
to
reach
the
house
next
door
the
eventful
day
arrived
and
i
gathered
together
my
small
family
one
from
her
limited
possession
of
two
small
rooms
being
very
pleased
to
have
me
with
her
which
could
not
otherwise
have
been
at
last
we
were
in
full
possession
and
at
once
proceeded
to
arrange
the
furniture
and
to
make
the
house
comfortable
on
the
second
day
i
began
to
work
in
earnest
having
been
unsettled
and
indisposed
for
several
weeks
when
i
came
downstairs
to
dinner
on
this
second
day
i
was
informed
that
the
landlady
had
already
been
there
to
say
that
she
objected
to
us
keeping
animals
on
being
told
there
was
not
the
least
intention
of
doing
the
same
she
said
that
she
certainly
thought
such
was
our
intention
seeing
that
we
were
in
possession
of
wood
and
that
she
strongly
objected
to
any
other
than
that
which
could
be
kept
indoors
the
wood
which
had
caused
all
this
suspicion
was
simply
a
clothes
prop
and
three
shelves
which
had
not
yet
been
removed
from
where
they
were
first
placed
i
laughed
heartily
at
this
unwarranted
interference
but
the
feminine
portion
of
the
family
strongly
resented
it
the
third
day
i
continued
my
work
the
others
again
working
on
the
comfort
of
this
large
house
one
being
outside
trimming
the
evergreens
and
taking
a
general
pride
in
our
half
orchard
and
half
park
ditto
the
third
day
and
so
on
day
after
day
until
the
rent
became
due
this
was
the
first
time
for
me
to
take
a
personal
hand
in
my
affairs
and
when
the
agent
called
i
thought
it
more
business
like
to
put
in
an
appearance
for
the
first
rent
day
at
least
seeing
that
the
house
was
in
my
name
after
which
others
might
attend
to
it
i
paid
the
rent
the
house
as
i
have
said
was
a
fine
large
villa
and
was
really
worth
fifteen
or
sixteen
shillings
a
week
and
this
small
amount
demanded
for
it
was
a
mystery
at
which
any
sensible
person
would
have
sniffed
this
agent
then
gave
me
a
book
with
the
rent
entered
to
my
account
after
this
he
handed
me
a
letter
which
said
he
was
sent
from
the
office
not
dreaming
of
its
contents
i
there
and
then
opened
this
letter
and
to
my
astonishment
saw
that
it
was
a
notice
to
quit
within
one
week
of
that
date
at
the
orders
of
and
her
solicitors
this
notice
was
a
severe
blow
for
up
till
then
the
place
had
been
unsettled
and
we
had
only
been
enjoying
the
expectation
of
future
comfort
who
or
what
does
this
lady
object
to
i
asked
the
agent
with
some
bitterness
i
need
absolute
quiet
for
my
work
and
the
amount
i
have
done
in
the
past
week
proves
that
i
have
had
it
what
then
has
disturbed
my
landlady
that
has
not
interfered
with
my
work
to
make
a
person
suffer
the
expense
and
worse
the
worry
of
moving
twice
in
a
few
days
should
not
be
done
without
due
consideration
and
some
definite
reason
but
the
agent
knew
or
pretended
to
know
nothing
of
the
affair
and
he
left
me
at
the
door
feeling
more
shame
and
mortification
than
i
have
ever
felt
before
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
but
to
pack
up
again
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
seek
fresh
quarters
which
after
great
difficulty
were
found
to
think
that
i
have
lived
years
and
not
to
have
known
the
folly
and
ill
policy
of
living
next
door
to
one
landlady
but
this
particular
landlady
is
eccentric
can
afford
to
be
independent
and
i
verily
believe
she
would
not
sell
a
house
for
even
twice
its
worth
if
she
thought
the
purchaser
to
be
a
man
incapable
of
taking
charge
of
property
her
house
is
more
often
unoccupied
than
let
as
i
have
since
been
told
for
the
most
respectable
people
can
not
live
near
her
apparently
this
is
the
case
for
the
house
was
still
empty
several
weeks
after
i
had
quit
in
spite
of
its
unreasonably
low
rent
and
the
beauty
of
its
surroundings
a
robin
came
to
the
back
door
every
morning
and
was
fed
perhaps
this
time
wasted
on
the
robin
might
have
been
better
employed
in
winning
the
good
graces
of
the
landlady
what
a
pity
such
an
eccentric
person
should
have
such
power
to
receive
people
as
tenants
for
a
few
days
and
then
to
dismiss
them
without
warning
or
giving
any
definite
reason
and
what
a
harvest
her
idiosyncrasies
must
be
to
her
solicitors
they
even
followed
me
up
and
demanded
another
week
rent
after
the
expense
of
moving
to
the
top
of
a
high
hill
and
down
again
which
up
to
the
present
i
have
not
paid
a
lawyer
would
certainly
be
a
lucky
man
to
be
allowed
control
over
the
interests
of
half
a
dozen
such
clients
and
he
could
dress
his
wife
and
daughters
in
silk
and
thoroughly
educate
his
sons
on
his
makings
i
have
been
told
that
she
is
a
deeply
religious
woman
therefore
although
she
said
in
her
own
heart
on
no
account
can
these
people
live
in
a
villa
of
mine
she
must
have
prayed
that
room
would
be
reserved
for
us
in
the
many
mansions
above
this
chapter
should
justify
itself
for
the
sake
of
the
worldly
wisdom
contained
in
the
simple
words
never
live
in
a
house
next
door
to
your
landlady
or
landlord
which
deserves
to
become
a
proverb
many
people
might
not
consider
this
warning
necessary
but
the
hint
may
be
useful
to
poor
travellers
like
myself
who
sick
of
wandering
would
settle
down
to
the
peace
and
quiet
of
after
days
such
has
been
my
life
rolling
unseen
and
unnoted
like
a
dark
planet
among
the
bright
and
at
last
emitting
a
few
rays
of
its
own
to
show
its
whereabouts
which
were
kindly
received
by
many
and
objected
to
by
a
few
among
the
latter
being
my
late
landlady
perhaps
i
am
deceived
as
to
the
worth
or
worthlessness
of
certain
people
but
i
have
given
my
experience
of
them
without
exaggeration
describing
as
near
as
memory
makes
it
possible
things
exactly
as
they
occurred
i
have
made
no
effort
to
conceal
my
gratitude
for
those
who
have
befriended
me
and
i
have
made
every
effort
to
conceal
bitterness
against
enemies
if
i
have
not
succeeded
in
the
latter
it
is
with
regret
but
if
i
have
failed
in
the
former
for
that
am
i
more
truly
and
deeply
sorry
if
i
have
appeared
ignorant
of
certain
matters
i
claim
exception
from
sin
through
a
lack
of
prejudice
which
is
after
all
the
only
ignorance
that
can
be
honestly
named
with
sin
these
have
been
my
experiences
and
if
i
have
not
omitted
to
mention
trouble
of
my
own
making
for
which
no
one
but
myself
was
to
blame
why
should
i
omit
the
mention
of
others
whom
i
blame
for
hours
more
bitter
people
are
not
to
be
blamed
for
their
doubts
but
that
they
make
no
effort
to
arrive
at
the
truth
however
much
people
of
a
higher
standing
may
doubt
the
veracity
of
certain
matters
i
have
the
one
consolation
to
know
that
many
a
poor
man
who
is
without
talent
or
means
to
make
his
experiences
public
knows
what
i
have
written
to
be
the
truth
it
is
but
a
poor
consolation
for
such
an
one
is
the
sufferer
and
not
the
supporter
and
he
is
powerless
in
the
hands
of
a
stronger
body
the
end
