that
of
tristan
and
queen
iseult
how
to
their
full

but

their
sorrow

and

at
last
they
died
of
that

together
upon
one
day
she
by
him
and
he
by
her
long
ago
when
mark
was
king
over
cornwall
rivalen
king
of
lyonesse
heard
that
mark
s
enemies
waged
war
on
him
so
he
crossed
the
sea
to
bring
him
aid
and
so
faithfully
did
he
serve
him
with
counsel
and
sword
that
mark
gave
him
his
sister
blanchefleur
whom
king
rivalen
loved
most
marvellously
he
wedded
her
in
tintagel
minster
but
hardly
was
she
wed
when
the
news
came
to
him
that
his
old
enemy
duke
morgan
had
fallen
on
lyonesse
and
was
wasting
town
and
field
then
rivalen
manned
his
ships
in
haste
and
took
blanchefleur
with
him
to
his
far
land
but
she
was
with
child
he
landed
below
his
castle
of
kanoël
and
gave
the
queen
in
ward
to
his
marshal
rohalt
and
after
that
set
off
to
wage
his
war
blanchefleur
waited
for
him
continually
but
he
did
not
come
home
till
she
learnt
upon
a
day
that
duke
morgan
had
killed
him
in
foul
ambush
she
did
not
weep
she
made
no
cry
or
lamentation
but
her
limbs
failed
her
and
grew
weak
and
her
soul
was
filled
with
a
strong
desire
to
be
rid
of
the
flesh
and
though
rohalt
tried
to
soothe
her
she
would
not
hear
three
days
she
awaited
with
her
lord
and
on
the
fourth
she
brought
forth
a
son
and
taking
him
in
her
arms
she
said
little
son
i
have
longed
a
while
to
see
you
and
now
i
see
you
the
fairest
thing
ever
a
woman
bore
in
sadness
came
i
hither
in
sadness
did
i
bring
forth
and
in
sadness
has
your
first
feast
day
gone
and
as
by
sadness
you
came
into
the
world
your
name
shall
be
called
tristan
that
is
the
child
of
after
she
had
said
these
words
she
kissed
him
and
immediately
when
she
had
kissed
him
she
died
rohalt
the
keeper
of
faith
took
the
child
but
already
duke
morgan
s
men
besieged
the
castle
of
kanoël
all
round
about
there
is
a
wise
saying
was
never
hardy
and
he
was
compelled
to
yield
to
duke
morgan
at
his
mercy
but
for
fear
that
morgan
might
slay
rivalen
s
heir
the
marshal
hid
him
among
his
own
sons
when
seven
years
were
passed
and
the
time
had
come
to
take
the
child
from
the
women
rohalt
put
tristan
under
a
good
master
the
squire
gorvenal
and
gorvenal
taught
him
in
a
few
years
the
arts
that
go
with
barony
he
taught
him
the
use
of
lance
and
sword
and
scutcheon
and
bow
and
how
to
cast
stone
quoits
and
to
leap
wide
dykes
also
and
he
taught
him
to
hate
every
lie
and
felony
and
to
keep
his
given
word
and
he
taught
him
the
various
kinds
of
song
and
and
the
hunter
s
craft
and
when
the
child
rode
among
the
young
squires
you
would
have
said
that
he
and
his
horse
and
his
armour
were
all
one
thing
to
see
him
so
noble
and
so
proud
broad
in
the
shoulders
loyal
strong
and
right
all
men
glorified
rohalt
in
such
a
son
but
rohalt
remembering
rivalen
and
blanchefleur
of
whose
youth
and
grace
all
this
was
a
resurrection
loved
him
indeed
as
a
son
but
in
his
heart
revered
him
as
his
lord
now
all
his
joy
was
snatched
from
him
on
a
day
when
certain
merchants
of
norway
having
lured
tristan
to
their
ship
bore
him
off
as
a
rich
prize
though
tristan
fought
hard
as
a
young
wolf
struggles
caught
in
a
gin
but
it
is
a
truth
well
proved
and
every
sailor
knows
it
that
the
sea
will
hardly
bear
a
felon
ship
and
gives
no
aid
to
rapine
the
sea
rose
and
cast
a
dark
storm
round
the
ship
and
drove
it
eight
days
and
eight
nights
at
random
till
the
mariners
caught
through
the
mist
a
coast
of
awful
cliffs
and
rocks
whereon
the
sea
would
have
ground
their
hull
to
pieces
then
they
did
penance
knowing
that
the
anger
of
the
sea
came
of
the
lad
whom
they
had
stolen
in
an
evil
hour
and
they
vowed
his
deliverance
and
got
ready
a
boat
to
put
him
if
it
might
be
ashore
then
the
wind
and
sea
fell
and
the
sky
shone
and
as
the
norway
ship
grew
small
in
the
offing
a
quiet
tide
cast
tristan
and
the
boat
upon
a
beach
of
sand
painfully
he
climbed
the
cliff
and
saw
beyond
a
lonely
rolling
heath
and
a
forest
stretching
out
and
endless
and
he
wept
remembering
gorvenal
his
father
and
the
land
of
lyonesse
then
the
distant
cry
of
a
hunt
with
horse
and
hound
came
suddenly
and
lifted
his
heart
and
a
tall
stag
broke
cover
at
the
forest
edge
the
pack
and
the
hunt
streamed
after
it
with
a
tumult
of
cries
and
winding
horns
but
just
as
the
hounds
were
racing
clustered
at
the
haunch
the
quarry
turned
to
bay
at
a
stones
throw
from
tristan
a
huntsman
gave
him
the
thrust
while
all
around
the
hunt
had
gathered
and
was
winding
the
kill
but
tristan
seeing
by
the
gesture
of
the
huntsman
that
he
made
to
cut
the
neck
of
the
stag
cried
out
my
lord
what
would
you
do
is
it
fitting
to
cut
up
so
noble
a
beast
like
any
hog
is
that
the
custom
of
this
country
and
the
huntsman
answered
fair
friend
what
startles
you
why
yes
first
i
take
off
the
head
of
a
stag
and
then
i
cut
it
into
four
quarters
and
we
carry
it
on
our
saddle
bows
to
king
mark
our
lord
so
do
we
and
so
since
the
days
of
the
first
huntsmen
have
done
the
cornish
men
if
however
you
know
of
some
nobler
custom
teach
it
us
take
this
knife
and
we
will
learn
it
then
tristan
kneeled
and
skinned
the
stag
before
he
cut
it
up
and
quartered
it
all
in
order
leaving
the
all
whole
as
is
meet
and
putting
aside
at
the
end
the
head
the
haunch
the
tongue
and
the
great
heart
s
vein
and
the
huntsmen
and
the
kennel
hinds
stood
over
him
with
delight
and
the
master
huntsman
said
friend
these
are
good
ways
in
what
land
learnt
you
them
tell
us
your
country
and
your
good
lord
my
name
is
tristan
and
i
learnt
these
ways
in
my
country
of
tristan
said
the
master
huntsman
god
reward
the
father
that
brought
you
up
so
nobly
doubtless
he
is
a
baron
rich
and
now
tristan
knew
both
speech
and
silence
and
he
answered
no
lord
my
father
is
a
burgess
i
left
his
home
unbeknownst
upon
a
ship
that
trafficked
to
a
far
place
for
i
wished
to
learn
how
men
lived
in
foreign
lands
but
if
you
will
accept
me
of
the
hunt
i
will
follow
you
gladly
and
teach
you
other
crafts
of
fair
tristan
i
marvel
there
should
be
a
land
where
a
burgess
s
son
can
know
what
a
knight
s
son
knows
not
elsewhere
but
come
with
us
since
you
will
it
and
welcome
we
will
bring
you
to
king
mark
our
tristan
completed
his
task
to
the
dogs
he
gave
the
heart
the
head
offal
and
ears
and
he
taught
the
hunt
how
the
skinning
and
the
ordering
should
be
done
then
he
thrust
the
pieces
upon
pikes
and
gave
them
to
this
huntsman
and
to
that
to
carry
to
one
the
snout
to
another
the
haunch
to
another
the
flank
to
another
the
chine
and
he
taught
them
how
to
ride
by
twos
in
rank
according
to
the
dignity
of
the
pieces
each
might
bear
so
they
took
the
road
and
spoke
together
till
they
came
on
a
great
castle
and
round
it
fields
and
orchards
and
living
waters
and
fish
ponds
and
plough
lands
and
many
ships
were
in
its
haven
for
that
castle
stood
above
the
sea
it
was
well
fenced
against
all
assault
or
engines
of
war
and
its
keep
which
the
giants
had
built
long
ago
was
compact
of
great
stones
like
a
chess
board
of
vert
and
azure
and
when
tristan
asked
its
name
good
liege
they
said
we
call
it
and
tristan
cried
tintagel
blessed
be
thou
of
god
and
blessed
be
they
that
dwell
within
therein
my
lords
therein
had
rivalen
taken
blanchefleur
to
wife
though
their
son
knew
it
not
when
they
came
before
the
keep
the
horns
brought
the
barons
to
the
gates
and
king
mark
himself
and
when
the
master
huntsman
had
told
him
all
the
story
and
king
mark
had
marvelled
at
the
good
order
of
the
cavalcade
and
the
cutting
of
the
stag
and
the
high
art
of
venery
in
all
yet
most
he
wondered
at
the
stranger
boy
and
still
gazed
at
him
troubled
and
wondering
whence
came
his
tenderness
and
his
heart
would
answer
him
nothing
but
my
lords
it
was
blood
that
spoke
and
the
love
he
had
long
since
borne
his
sister
blanchefleur
that
evening
when
the
boards
were
cleared
a
singer
out
of
wales
a
master
came
forward
among
the
barons
in
hall
and
sang
a
harper
s
song
and
as
this
harper
touched
the
strings
of
his
harp
tristan
who
sat
at
the
king
s
feet
spoke
thus
to
him
oh
master
that
is
the
first
of
songs
the
bretons
of
old
wove
it
once
to
chant
the
loves
of
graëlent
and
the
melody
is
rare
and
rare
are
the
words
master
your
voice
is
subtle
harp
us
that
but
when
the
welshman
had
sung
he
answered
boy
what
do
you
know
of
the
craft
of
music
if
the
burgesses
of
lyonesse
teach
their
sons
also
and
rotes
and
viols
too
rise
and
take
this
harp
and
show
your
then
tristan
took
the
harp
and
sang
so
well
that
the
barons
softened
as
they
heard
and
king
mark
marvelled
at
the
harper
from
lyonesse
whither
so
long
ago
rivalen
had
taken
blanchefleur
away
when
the
song
ended
the
king
was
silent
a
long
space
but
he
said
at
last
son
blessed
be
the
master
that
taught
thee
and
blessed
be
thou
of
god
for
god
loves
good
singers
their
voices
and
the
voice
of
the
harp
enter
the
souls
of
men
and
wake
dear
memories
and
cause
them
to
forget
many
a
mourning
and
many
a
sin
for
our
joy
did
you
come
to
this
roof
stay
near
us
a
long
time
and
tristan
answered
very
willingly
will
i
serve
you
sire
as
your
harper
your
huntsman
and
your
so
did
he
and
for
three
years
a
mutual
love
grew
up
in
their
hearts
by
day
tristan
followed
king
mark
at
pleas
and
in
saddle
by
night
he
slept
in
the
royal
room
with
the
councillors
and
the
peers
and
if
the
king
was
sad
he
would
harp
to
him
to
soothe
his
care
the
barons
also
cherished
him
and
as
you
shall
learn
dinas
of
lidan
the
seneschal
beyond
all
others
and
more
tenderly
than
the
barons
and
than
dinas
the
king
loved
him
but
tristan
could
not
forget
or
rohalt
his
father
or
his
master
gorvenal
or
the
land
of
lyonesse
my
lords
a
teller
that
would
please
should
not
stretch
his
tale
too
long
and
truly
this
tale
is
so
various
and
so
high
that
it
needs
no
straining
then
let
me
shortly
tell
how
rohalt
himself
after
long
wandering
by
sea
and
land
came
into
cornwall
and
found
tristan
and
showing
the
king
the
carbuncle
that
once
was
blanchefleur
s
said
king
mark
here
is
your
nephew
tristan
son
of
your
sister
blanchefleur
and
of
king
rivalen
duke
morgan
holds
his
land
most
wrongfully
it
is
time
such
land
came
back
to
its
and
tristan
in
a
word
when
his
uncle
had
armed
him
knight
crossed
the
sea
and
was
hailed
of
his
father
s
vassals
and
killed
rivalen
s
slayer
and
was
of
his
land
then
remembering
how
king
mark
could
no
longer
live
in
joy
without
him
he
summoned
his
council
and
his
barons
and
said
this
lords
of
the
lyonesse
i
have
retaken
this
place
and
i
have
avenged
king
rivalen
by
the
help
of
god
and
of
you
but
two
men
rohalt
and
king
mark
of
cornwall
nourished
me
an
orphan
and
a
wandering
boy
so
should
i
call
them
also
fathers
now
a
free
man
has
two
things
thoroughly
his
own
his
body
and
his
land
to
rohalt
then
here
i
will
release
my
land
do
you
hold
it
father
and
your
son
shall
hold
it
after
you
but
my
body
i
give
up
to
king
mark
i
will
leave
this
country
dear
though
it
be
and
in
cornwall
i
will
serve
king
mark
as
my
lord
such
is
my
judgment
but
you
my
lords
of
lyonesse
are
my
lieges
and
owe
me
counsel
if
then
some
one
of
you
will
counsel
me
another
thing
let
him
rise
and
but
all
the
barons
praised
him
though
they
wept
and
taking
with
him
gorvenal
only
tristan
set
sail
for
king
mark
s
land
the
morholt
out
of
ireland
when
tristan
came
back
to
that
land
king
mark
and
all
his
barony
were
mourning
for
the
king
of
ireland
had
manned
a
fleet
to
ravage
cornwall
should
king
mark
refuse
as
he
had
refused
these
fifteen
years
to
pay
a
tribute
his
fathers
had
paid
now
that
year
this
king
had
sent
to
tintagel
to
carry
his
summons
a
giant
knight
the
morholt
whose
sister
he
had
wed
and
whom
no
man
had
yet
been
able
to
overcome
so
king
mark
had
summoned
all
the
barons
of
his
land
to
council
by
letters
sealed
on
the
day
assigned
when
the
barons
were
gathered
in
hall
and
when
the
king
had
taken
his
throne
the
morholt
said
these
things
king
mark
hear
for
the
last
time
the
summons
of
the
king
of
ireland
my
lord
he
arraigns
you
to
pay
at
last
that
which
you
have
owed
so
long
and
because
you
have
refused
it
too
long
already
he
bids
you
give
over
to
me
this
day
three
hundred
youths
and
three
hundred
maidens
drawn
by
lot
from
among
the
cornish
folk
but
if
so
be
that
any
would
prove
by
trial
of
combat
that
the
king
of
ireland
receives
this
tribute
without
right
i
will
take
up
his
wager
which
among
you
my
cornish
lords
will
fight
to
redeem
this
land
the
barons
glanced
at
each
other
but
all
were
silent
then
tristan
knelt
at
the
feet
of
king
mark
and
said
lord
king
by
your
leave
i
will
do
and
in
vain
would
king
mark
have
turned
him
from
his
purpose
thinking
how
could
even
valour
save
so
young
a
knight
but
he
threw
down
his
gage
to
the
morholt
and
the
morholt
took
up
the
gage
on
the
appointed
day
he
had
himself
clad
for
a
great
feat
of
arms
in
a
hauberk
and
in
a
steel
helm
and
he
entered
a
boat
and
drew
to
the
islet
of
samson
s
where
the
knights
were
to
fight
each
to
each
alone
now
the
morholt
had
hoisted
to
his
mast
a
sail
of
rich
purple
and
coming
fast
to
land
he
moored
his
boat
on
the
shore
but
tristan
pushed
off
his
own
boat
adrift
with
his
feet
and
said
one
of
us
only
will
go
hence
alive
one
boat
will
and
each
rousing
the
other
to
the
fray
they
passed
into
the
isle
no
man
saw
the
sharp
combat
but
thrice
the
salt
had
wafted
or
seemed
to
waft
a
cry
of
fury
to
the
land
when
at
last
towards
the
hour
of
noon
the
purple
sail
showed
far
off
the
irish
boat
appeared
from
the
island
shore
and
there
rose
a
clamour
of
the
morholt
when
suddenly
as
the
boat
grew
larger
on
the
sight
and
topped
a
wave
they
saw
that
tristan
stood
on
the
prow
holding
a
sword
in
his
hand
he
leapt
ashore
and
as
the
mothers
kissed
the
steel
upon
his
feet
he
cried
to
the
morholt
s
men
my
lords
of
ireland
the
morholt
fought
well
see
here
my
sword
is
broken
and
a
splinter
of
it
stands
fast
in
his
head
take
you
that
steel
my
lords
it
is
the
tribute
of
then
he
went
up
to
tintagel
and
as
he
went
the
people
he
had
freed
waved
green
boughs
and
rich
cloths
were
hung
at
the
windows
but
when
tristan
reached
the
castle
with
joy
songs
and
sounding
about
him
he
drooped
in
the
arms
of
king
mark
for
the
blood
ran
from
his
wounds
the
morholt
s
men
they
landed
in
ireland
quite
cast
down
for
when
ever
he
came
back
into
whitehaven
the
morholt
had
been
wont
to
take
joy
in
the
sight
of
his
clan
upon
the
shore
of
the
queen
his
sister
and
of
his
niece
iseult
the
fair
tenderly
had
they
cherished
him
of
old
and
had
he
taken
some
wound
they
healed
him
for
they
were
skilled
in
balms
and
potions
but
now
their
magic
was
vain
for
he
lay
dead
and
the
splinter
of
the
foreign
brand
yet
stood
in
his
skull
till
iseult
plucked
it
out
and
shut
it
in
a
chest
from
that
day
iseult
the
fair
knew
and
hated
the
name
of
tristan
of
lyonesse
but
over
in
tintagel
tristan
languished
for
there
trickled
a
poisonous
blood
from
his
wound
the
doctors
found
that
the
morholt
had
thrust
into
him
a
poisoned
barb
and
as
their
potions
and
their
theriac
could
never
heal
him
they
left
him
in
god
s
hands
so
hateful
a
stench
came
from
his
wound
that
all
his
dearest
friends
fled
him
all
save
king
mark
gorvenal
and
dinas
of
lidan
they
always
could
stay
near
his
couch
because
their
love
overcame
their
abhorrence
at
last
tristan
had
himself
carried
into
a
boat
apart
on
the
shore
and
lying
facing
the
sea
he
awaited
death
for
he
thought
i
must
die
but
it
is
good
to
see
the
sun
and
my
heart
is
still
high
i
would
like
to
try
the
sea
that
brings
all
chances
i
would
have
the
sea
bear
me
far
off
alone
to
what
land
no
matter
so
that
it
heal
me
of
my
he
begged
so
long
that
king
mark
accepted
his
desire
he
bore
him
into
a
boat
with
neither
sail
nor
oar
and
tristan
wished
that
his
harp
only
should
be
placed
beside
him
for
sails
he
could
not
lift
nor
oar
ply
nor
sword
wield
and
as
a
seaman
on
some
long
voyage
casts
to
the
sea
a
beloved
companion
dead
so
gorvenal
pushed
out
to
sea
that
boat
where
his
dear
son
lay
and
the
sea
drew
him
away
for
seven
days
and
seven
nights
the
sea
so
drew
him
at
times
to
charm
his
grief
he
harped
and
when
at
last
the
sea
brought
him
near
a
shore
where
fishermen
had
left
their
port
that
night
to
fish
far
out
they
heard
as
they
rowed
a
sweet
and
strong
and
living
tune
that
ran
above
the
sea
and
feathering
their
oars
they
listened
immovable
in
the
first
whiteness
of
the
dawn
they
saw
the
boat
at
large
she
went
at
random
and
nothing
seemed
to
live
in
her
except
the
voice
of
the
harp
but
as
they
neared
the
air
grew
weaker
and
died
and
when
they
hailed
her
tristan
s
hands
had
fallen
lifeless
on
the
strings
though
they
still
trembled
the
fishermen
took
him
in
and
bore
him
back
to
port
to
their
lady
who
was
merciful
and
perhaps
would
heal
him
it
was
that
same
port
of
whitehaven
where
the
morholt
lay
and
their
lady
was
iseult
the
fair
she
alone
being
skilled
in
philtres
could
save
tristan
but
she
alone
wished
him
dead
when
tristan
knew
himself
again
for
her
art
restored
him
he
knew
himself
to
be
in
the
land
of
peril
but
he
was
yet
strong
to
hold
his
own
and
found
good
crafty
words
he
told
a
tale
of
how
he
was
a
seer
that
had
taken
passage
on
a
merchant
ship
and
sailed
to
spain
to
learn
the
art
of
reading
all
the
stars
how
pirates
had
boarded
the
ship
and
of
how
though
wounded
he
had
fled
into
that
boat
he
was
believed
nor
did
any
of
the
morholt
s
men
know
his
face
again
so
hardly
had
the
poison
used
it
but
when
after
forty
days
iseult
of
the
golden
hair
had
all
but
healed
him
when
already
his
limbs
had
recovered
and
the
grace
of
youth
returned
he
knew
that
he
must
escape
and
he
fled
and
after
many
dangers
he
came
again
before
mark
the
king
the
quest
of
the
lady
with
the
hair
of
gold
my
lords
there
were
in
the
court
of
king
mark
four
barons
the
basest
of
men
who
hated
tristan
with
a
hard
hate
for
his
greatness
and
for
the
tender
love
the
king
bore
him
and
well
i
know
their
names
andret
guenelon
gondoïne
and
denoalen
they
knew
that
the
king
had
intent
to
grow
old
childless
and
to
leave
his
land
to
tristan
and
their
envy
swelled
and
by
lies
they
angered
the
chief
men
of
cornwall
against
tristan
they
said
there
have
been
too
many
marvels
in
this
man
s
life
it
was
marvel
enough
that
he
beat
the
morholt
but
by
what
sorcery
did
he
try
the
sea
alone
at
the
point
of
death
or
which
of
us
my
lords
could
voyage
without
mast
or
sail
they
say
that
warlocks
can
it
was
sure
a
warlock
feat
and
that
is
a
warlock
harp
of
his
pours
poison
daily
into
the
king
s
heart
see
how
he
has
bent
that
heart
by
power
and
chain
of
sorcery
he
will
be
king
yet
my
lords
and
you
will
hold
your
lands
of
a
they
brought
over
the
greater
part
of
the
barons
and
these
pressed
king
mark
to
take
to
wife
some
king
s
daughter
who
should
give
him
an
heir
or
else
they
threatened
to
return
each
man
into
his
keep
and
wage
him
war
but
the
king
turned
against
them
and
swore
in
his
heart
that
so
long
as
his
dear
nephew
lived
no
king
s
daughter
should
come
to
his
bed
then
in
his
turn
did
tristan
in
his
shame
to
be
thought
to
serve
for
hire
threaten
that
if
the
king
did
not
yield
to
his
barons
he
would
himself
go
over
sea
serve
some
great
king
at
this
king
mark
made
a
term
with
his
barons
and
gave
them
forty
days
to
hear
his
decision
on
the
appointed
day
he
waited
alone
in
his
chamber
and
sadly
mused
where
shall
i
find
a
king
s
daughter
so
fair
and
yet
so
distant
that
i
may
feign
to
wish
her
my
wife
just
then
by
his
window
that
looked
upon
the
sea
two
building
swallows
came
in
quarrelling
together
then
startled
they
flew
out
but
had
let
fall
from
their
beaks
a
woman
s
hair
long
and
fine
and
shining
like
a
beam
of
light
king
mark
took
it
and
called
his
barons
and
tristan
and
said
to
please
you
lords
i
will
take
a
wife
but
you
must
seek
her
whom
i
have
fair
lord
we
wish
it
all
they
said
and
who
may
she
be
why
said
he
she
whose
hair
this
is
nor
will
i
take
and
whence
lord
king
comes
this
hair
of
gold
who
brought
it
and
from
what
land
it
comes
my
lords
from
the
lady
with
the
hair
of
gold
the
swallows
brought
it
me
they
know
from
what
country
it
then
the
barons
saw
themselves
mocked
and
cheated
and
they
turned
with
sneers
to
tristan
for
they
thought
him
to
have
counselled
the
trick
but
tristan
when
he
had
looked
on
the
hair
of
gold
remembered
iseult
the
fair
and
smiled
and
said
this
king
mark
can
you
not
see
that
the
doubts
of
these
lords
shame
me
you
have
designed
in
vain
i
will
go
seek
the
lady
with
the
hair
of
gold
the
search
is
perilous
never
the
less
my
uncle
i
would
once
more
put
my
body
and
my
life
into
peril
for
you
and
that
your
barons
may
know
i
love
you
loyally
i
take
this
oath
to
die
on
the
adventure
or
to
bring
back
to
this
castle
of
tintagel
the
queen
with
that
fair
he
fitted
out
a
great
ship
and
loaded
it
with
corn
and
wine
with
honey
and
all
manner
of
good
things
he
manned
it
with
gorvenal
and
a
hundred
young
knights
of
high
birth
chosen
among
the
bravest
and
he
clothed
them
in
coats
of
and
in
hair
cloth
so
that
they
seemed
merchants
only
but
under
the
deck
he
hid
rich
cloth
of
gold
and
scarlet
as
for
a
great
king
s
messengers
when
the
ship
had
taken
the
sea
the
helmsman
asked
him
lord
to
what
land
shall
i
steer
sir
said
he
steer
for
ireland
straight
for
whitehaven
at
first
tristan
made
believe
to
the
men
of
whitehaven
that
his
friends
were
merchants
of
england
come
peacefully
to
barter
but
as
these
strange
merchants
passed
the
day
in
the
useless
games
of
draughts
and
chess
and
seemed
to
know
dice
better
than
the
bargain
price
of
corn
tristan
feared
discovery
and
knew
not
how
to
pursue
his
quest
now
it
chanced
once
upon
the
break
of
day
that
he
heard
a
cry
so
terrible
that
one
would
have
called
it
a
demon
s
cry
nor
had
he
ever
heard
a
brute
bellow
in
such
wise
so
awful
and
strange
it
seemed
he
called
a
woman
who
passed
by
the
harbour
and
said
tell
me
lady
whence
comes
that
voice
i
have
heard
and
hide
me
my
lord
said
she
i
will
tell
you
truly
it
is
the
roar
of
a
dragon
the
most
terrible
and
dauntless
upon
earth
daily
it
leaves
its
den
and
stands
at
one
of
the
gates
of
the
city
nor
can
any
come
out
or
go
in
till
a
maiden
has
been
given
up
to
it
and
when
it
has
her
in
its
claws
it
devours
lady
said
tristan
make
no
mock
of
me
but
tell
me
straight
can
a
man
born
of
woman
kill
this
thing
fair
sir
and
gentle
she
said
i
can
not
say
but
this
is
sure
twenty
knights
and
tried
have
run
the
venture
because
the
king
of
ireland
has
published
it
that
he
will
give
his
daughter
iseult
the
fair
to
whomsoever
shall
kill
the
beast
but
it
has
devoured
them
tristan
left
the
woman
and
returning
to
his
ship
armed
himself
in
secret
and
it
was
a
fine
sight
to
see
so
noble
a
charger
and
so
good
a
knight
come
out
from
such
a
but
the
haven
was
empty
of
folk
for
the
dawn
had
barely
broken
and
none
saw
him
as
he
rode
to
the
gate
and
hardly
had
he
passed
it
when
he
met
suddenly
five
men
at
full
gallop
flying
towards
the
town
tristan
seized
one
by
his
hair
as
he
passed
and
dragged
him
over
his
mount
s
crupper
and
held
him
fast
god
save
you
my
lord
said
he
and
whence
does
the
dragon
come
and
when
the
other
had
shown
him
by
what
road
he
let
him
go
as
the
monster
neared
he
showed
the
head
of
a
bear
and
red
eyes
like
coals
of
fire
and
hairy
tufted
ears
lion
s
claws
a
serpent
s
tail
and
a
griffin
s
body
tristan
charged
his
horse
at
him
so
strongly
that
though
the
beast
s
mane
stood
with
fright
yet
he
drove
at
the
dragon
his
lance
struck
its
scales
and
shivered
then
tristan
drew
his
sword
and
struck
at
the
dragon
s
head
but
he
did
not
so
much
as
cut
the
hide
the
beast
felt
the
blow
with
its
claws
he
dragged
at
the
shield
and
broke
it
from
the
arm
then
his
breast
unshielded
tristan
used
the
sword
again
and
struck
so
strongly
that
the
air
rang
all
round
about
but
in
vain
for
he
could
not
wound
and
meanwhile
the
dragon
vomited
from
his
nostrils
two
streams
of
flames
and
tristan
s
helm
blackened
like
a
cinder
and
his
horse
stumbled
and
fell
down
and
died
but
tristan
standing
on
his
feet
thrust
his
sword
right
into
the
beast
s
jaws
and
split
its
heart
in
two
then
he
cut
out
the
tongue
and
put
it
into
his
hose
but
as
the
poison
came
against
his
flesh
the
hero
fainted
and
fell
in
the
high
grass
that
bordered
the
marsh
around
now
the
man
he
had
stopped
in
flight
was
the
seneschal
of
ireland
and
he
desired
iseult
the
fair
and
though
he
was
a
coward
he
had
dared
so
far
as
to
return
with
his
companions
secretly
and
he
found
the
dragon
dead
so
he
cut
off
its
head
and
bore
it
to
the
king
and
claimed
the
great
reward
the
king
could
credit
his
prowess
but
hardly
yet
wished
justice
done
and
summoned
his
vassals
to
court
so
that
there
before
the
barony
assembled
the
seneschal
should
furnish
proof
of
his
victory
won
when
iseult
the
fair
heard
that
she
was
to
be
given
to
this
coward
first
she
laughed
long
and
then
she
wailed
but
on
the
morrow
doubting
some
trick
she
took
with
her
perinis
her
squire
and
brangien
her
maid
and
all
three
rode
unbeknownst
towards
the
dragon
s
lair
and
iseult
saw
such
a
trail
on
the
road
as
made
her
the
hoofs
that
made
it
had
never
been
shod
in
her
land
then
she
came
on
the
dragon
headless
and
a
dead
horse
beside
him
nor
was
the
horse
harnessed
in
the
fashion
of
ireland
some
foreign
man
had
slain
the
beast
but
they
knew
not
whether
he
still
lived
or
no
they
sought
him
long
iseult
and
perinis
and
brangien
together
till
at
last
brangien
saw
the
helm
glittering
in
the
marshy
grass
and
tristan
still
breathed
perinis
put
him
on
his
horse
and
bore
him
secretly
to
the
women
s
rooms
there
iseult
told
her
mother
the
tale
and
left
the
hero
with
her
and
as
the
queen
unharnessed
him
the
dragon
s
tongue
fell
from
his
boot
of
steel
then
the
queen
of
ireland
revived
him
by
the
virtue
of
an
herb
and
said
stranger
i
know
you
for
the
true
slayer
of
the
dragon
but
our
seneschal
a
felon
cut
off
its
head
and
claims
my
daughter
iseult
for
his
wage
will
you
be
ready
two
days
hence
to
give
him
the
lie
in
battle
queen
said
he
the
time
is
short
but
you
i
think
can
cure
me
in
two
days
upon
the
dragon
i
conquered
iseult
and
on
the
seneschal
perhaps
i
shall
reconquer
then
the
queen
brewed
him
strong
brews
and
on
the
morrow
iseult
the
fair
got
him
ready
a
bath
and
anointed
him
with
a
balm
her
mother
had
conjured
and
as
he
looked
at
her
he
thought
so
i
have
found
the
queen
of
the
hair
of
gold
and
he
smiled
as
he
thought
it
but
iseult
noting
it
thought
why
does
he
smile
or
what
have
i
neglected
of
the
things
due
to
a
guest
he
smiles
to
think
i
have
gotten
to
burnish
his
she
went
and
drew
the
sword
from
its
rich
sheath
but
when
she
saw
the
splinter
gone
and
the
gap
in
the
edge
she
thought
of
the
morholt
s
head
she
balanced
a
moment
in
doubt
then
she
went
to
where
she
kept
the
steel
she
had
found
in
the
skull
and
she
put
it
to
the
sword
and
it
fitted
so
that
the
join
was
hardly
seen
she
ran
to
where
tristan
lay
wounded
and
with
the
sword
above
him
she
cried
you
are
that
tristan
of
the
lyonesse
who
killed
the
morholt
my
mother
s
brother
and
now
you
shall
die
in
your
tristan
strained
to
ward
the
blow
but
he
was
too
weak
his
wit
however
stood
firm
in
spite
of
evil
and
he
said
so
be
it
let
me
die
but
to
save
yourself
long
memories
listen
awhile
king
s
daughter
my
life
is
not
only
in
your
power
but
is
yours
of
right
my
life
is
yours
because
you
have
twice
returned
it
me
once
long
ago
for
i
was
the
wounded
harper
whom
you
healed
of
the
poison
of
the
morholt
s
shaft
nor
repent
the
healing
were
not
these
wounds
had
in
fair
fight
did
i
kill
the
morholt
by
treason
had
he
not
defied
me
and
was
i
not
held
to
the
defence
of
my
body
and
now
this
second
time
also
you
have
saved
me
it
was
for
you
i
fought
the
beast
but
let
us
leave
these
things
i
would
but
show
you
how
my
life
is
your
own
then
if
you
kill
me
of
right
for
the
glory
of
it
you
may
ponder
for
long
years
praising
yourself
that
you
killed
a
wounded
guest
who
had
wagered
his
life
in
your
iseult
replied
i
hear
strange
words
why
should
he
that
killed
the
morholt
seek
me
also
his
niece
doubtless
because
the
morholt
came
for
a
tribute
of
maidens
from
cornwall
so
you
came
to
boast
returning
that
you
had
brought
back
the
maiden
who
was
nearest
to
him
to
cornwall
a
king
s
daughter
said
tristan
no
one
day
two
swallows
flew
and
flew
to
tintagel
and
bore
one
hair
out
of
all
your
hairs
of
gold
and
i
thought
they
brought
me
good
will
and
peace
so
i
came
to
find
you
see
here
amid
the
threads
of
gold
upon
my
coat
your
hair
is
sown
the
threads
are
tarnished
but
your
bright
hair
still
iseult
put
down
the
sword
and
taking
up
the
coat
of
arms
she
saw
upon
it
the
hair
of
gold
and
was
silent
a
long
space
till
she
kissed
him
on
the
lips
to
prove
peace
and
she
put
rich
garments
over
him
on
the
day
of
the
barons
assembly
tristan
sent
perinis
privily
to
his
ship
to
summon
his
companions
that
they
should
come
to
court
adorned
as
befitted
the
envoys
of
a
great
king
one
by
one
the
hundred
knights
passed
into
the
hall
where
all
the
barons
of
ireland
stood
they
entered
in
silence
and
sat
all
in
rank
together
on
their
scarlet
and
purple
the
gems
gleamed
when
the
king
had
taken
his
throne
the
seneschal
arose
to
prove
by
witness
and
by
arms
that
he
had
slain
the
dragon
and
that
so
iseult
was
won
then
iseult
bowed
to
her
father
and
said
king
i
have
here
a
man
who
challenges
your
seneschal
for
lies
and
felony
promise
that
you
will
pardon
this
man
all
his
past
deeds
who
stands
to
prove
that
he
and
none
other
slew
the
dragon
and
grant
him
forgiveness
and
your
the
king
said
i
grant
but
iseult
said
father
first
give
me
the
kiss
of
peace
and
forgiveness
as
a
sign
that
you
will
give
him
the
then
she
found
tristan
and
led
him
before
the
barony
and
as
he
came
the
hundred
knights
rose
all
together
and
crossed
their
arms
upon
their
breasts
and
bowed
so
the
irish
knew
that
he
was
their
lord
but
among
the
irish
many
knew
him
again
and
cried
tristan
of
lyonesse
that
slew
the
morholt
they
drew
their
swords
and
clamoured
for
death
but
iseult
cried
king
kiss
this
man
upon
the
lips
as
your
oath
was
and
the
king
kissed
him
and
the
clamour
fell
then
tristan
showed
the
dragon
s
tongue
and
offered
the
seneschal
battle
but
the
seneschal
looked
at
his
face
and
dared
not
then
tristan
said
my
lords
you
have
said
it
and
it
is
truth
i
killed
the
morholt
but
i
crossed
the
sea
to
offer
you
a
good
to
ransom
that
deed
and
get
me
quit
of
it
i
put
my
body
in
peril
of
death
and
rid
you
of
the
beast
and
have
so
conquered
iseult
the
fair
and
having
conquered
her
i
will
bear
her
away
on
my
ship
but
that
these
lands
of
cornwall
and
ireland
may
know
no
more
hatred
but
love
only
learn
that
king
mark
my
lord
will
marry
her
here
stand
a
hundred
knights
of
high
name
who
all
will
swear
with
an
oath
upon
the
relics
of
the
holy
saints
that
king
mark
sends
you
by
their
embassy
offer
of
peace
and
of
brotherhood
and
goodwill
and
that
he
would
by
your
courtesy
hold
iseult
as
his
honoured
wife
and
that
he
would
have
all
the
men
of
cornwall
serve
her
as
their
when
the
lords
of
ireland
heard
this
they
acclaimed
it
and
the
king
also
was
content
then
since
that
treaty
and
alliance
was
to
be
made
the
king
her
father
took
iseult
by
the
hand
and
asked
of
tristan
that
he
should
take
an
oath
to
wit
that
he
would
lead
her
loyally
to
his
lord
and
tristan
took
that
oath
and
swore
it
before
the
knights
and
the
barony
of
ireland
assembled
then
the
king
put
iseult
s
right
hand
into
tristan
s
right
hand
and
tristan
held
it
for
a
space
in
token
of
seizin
for
the
king
of
cornwall
so
for
the
love
of
king
mark
did
tristan
conquer
the
queen
of
the
hair
of
gold
the
philtre
when
the
day
of
iseult
s
livery
to
the
lords
of
cornwall
drew
near
her
mother
gathered
herbs
and
flowers
and
roots
and
steeped
them
in
wine
and
brewed
a
potion
of
might
and
having
done
so
said
apart
to
brangien
child
it
is
yours
to
go
with
iseult
to
king
mark
s
country
for
you
love
her
with
a
faithful
love
take
then
this
pitcher
and
remember
well
my
words
hide
it
so
that
no
eye
shall
see
nor
no
lip
go
near
it
but
when
the
wedding
night
has
come
and
that
moment
in
which
the
wedded
are
left
alone
pour
this
essenced
wine
into
a
cup
and
offer
it
to
king
mark
and
to
iseult
his
queen
oh
take
all
care
my
child
that
they
alone
shall
taste
this
brew
for
this
is
its
power
they
who
drink
of
it
together
love
each
other
with
their
every
single
sense
and
with
their
every
thought
forever
in
life
and
in
and
brangien
promised
the
queen
that
she
would
do
her
bidding
on
the
bark
that
bore
her
to
tintagel
iseult
the
fair
was
weeping
as
she
remembered
her
own
land
and
mourning
swelled
her
heart
and
she
said
who
am
i
that
i
should
leave
you
to
follow
unknown
men
my
mother
and
my
land
accursed
be
the
sea
that
bears
me
for
rather
would
i
lie
dead
on
the
earth
where
i
was
born
than
live
out
there
beyond
one
day
when
the
wind
had
fallen
and
the
sails
hung
slack
tristan
dropped
anchor
by
an
island
and
the
hundred
knights
of
cornwall
and
the
sailors
weary
of
the
sea
landed
all
iseult
alone
remained
aboard
and
a
little
serving
maid
when
tristan
came
near
the
queen
to
calm
her
sorrow
the
sun
was
hot
above
them
and
they
were
athirst
and
as
they
called
the
little
maid
looked
about
for
drink
for
them
and
found
that
pitcher
which
the
mother
of
iseult
had
given
into
brangien
s
keeping
and
when
she
came
on
it
the
child
cried
i
have
found
you
wine
now
she
had
found
not
wine
but
passion
and
joy
most
sharp
and
anguish
without
end
and
death
the
queen
drank
deep
of
that
draught
and
gave
it
to
tristan
and
he
drank
also
long
and
emptied
it
all
brangien
came
in
upon
them
she
saw
them
gazing
at
each
other
in
silence
as
though
ravished
and
apart
she
saw
before
them
the
pitcher
standing
there
she
snatched
it
up
and
cast
it
into
the
shuddering
sea
and
cried
aloud
cursed
be
the
day
i
was
born
and
cursed
the
day
that
first
i
trod
this
deck
iseult
my
friend
and
tristan
you
you
have
drunk
death
and
once
more
the
bark
ran
free
for
tintagel
but
it
seemed
to
tristan
as
though
an
ardent
briar
but
with
flower
most
sweet
smelling
drave
roots
into
his
blood
and
laced
the
lovely
body
of
iseult
all
round
about
it
and
bound
it
to
his
own
and
to
his
every
thought
and
desire
and
he
thought
felons
that
charged
me
with
coveting
king
mark
s
land
i
have
come
lower
by
far
for
it
is
not
his
land
i
covet
fair
uncle
who
loved
me
orphaned
ere
ever
you
knew
in
me
the
blood
of
your
sister
blanchefleur
you
that
wept
as
you
bore
me
to
that
boat
alone
why
did
you
not
drive
out
the
boy
that
was
to
betray
you
ah
what
thought
was
that
iseult
is
yours
and
i
am
but
your
vassal
iseult
is
yours
and
i
am
your
son
iseult
is
yours
and
may
not
love
but
iseult
loved
him
though
she
would
have
hated
she
could
not
hate
for
a
tenderness
more
sharp
than
hatred
tore
her
and
brangien
watched
them
in
anguish
suffering
more
cruelly
because
she
alone
knew
the
depth
of
evil
done
two
days
she
watched
them
seeing
them
refuse
all
food
or
comfort
and
seeking
each
other
as
blind
men
seek
wretched
apart
and
together
more
wretched
still
for
then
they
trembled
each
for
the
first
avowal
on
the
third
day
as
tristan
neared
the
tent
on
deck
where
iseult
sat
she
saw
him
coming
and
she
said
to
him
very
humbly
come
in
my
queen
said
tristan
why
do
you
call
me
lord
am
i
not
your
liege
and
vassal
to
revere
and
serve
and
cherish
you
as
my
lady
and
queen
but
iseult
answered
no
you
know
that
you
are
my
lord
and
my
master
and
i
your
slave
ah
why
did
i
not
sharpen
those
wounds
of
the
wounded
singer
or
let
die
that
in
the
grasses
of
the
marsh
but
then
i
did
not
know
what
now
i
know
and
what
is
it
that
you
know
iseult
she
laid
her
arm
upon
tristan
s
shoulder
the
light
of
her
eyes
was
drowned
and
her
lips
trembled
the
love
of
you
she
said
whereat
he
put
his
lips
to
hers
but
as
they
thus
tasted
their
first
joy
brangien
that
watched
them
stretched
her
arms
and
cried
at
their
feet
in
tears
stay
and
return
if
still
you
can
but
oh
that
path
has
no
returning
for
already
love
and
his
strength
drag
you
on
and
now
henceforth
forever
never
shall
you
know
joy
without
pain
again
the
wine
possesses
you
the
draught
your
mother
gave
me
the
draught
the
king
alone
should
have
drunk
with
you
but
that
old
enemy
has
tricked
us
all
us
three
friend
tristan
iseult
my
friend
for
that
bad
ward
i
kept
take
here
my
body
and
my
life
for
through
me
and
in
that
cup
you
have
drunk
not
love
alone
but
love
and
death
the
lovers
held
each
other
life
and
desire
trembled
through
their
youth
and
tristan
said
well
then
come
and
as
evening
fell
upon
the
bark
that
heeled
and
ran
to
king
mark
s
land
they
gave
themselves
up
utterly
to
love
the
tall
as
king
mark
came
down
to
greet
iseult
upon
the
shore
tristan
took
her
hand
and
led
her
to
the
king
and
the
king
took
seizin
of
her
taking
her
hand
he
led
her
in
great
pomp
to
his
castle
of
tintagel
and
as
she
came
in
hall
amid
the
vassals
her
beauty
shone
so
that
the
walls
were
lit
as
they
are
lit
at
dawn
then
king
mark
blessed
those
swallows
which
by
happy
courtesy
had
brought
the
hair
of
gold
and
tristan
also
he
blessed
and
the
hundred
knights
who
on
that
adventurous
bark
had
gone
to
find
him
joy
of
heart
and
of
eyes
yet
to
him
also
that
ship
was
to
bring
sting
torment
and
mourning
and
on
the
eighteenth
day
having
called
his
barony
together
he
took
iseult
to
wife
but
on
the
wedding
night
to
save
her
friend
brangien
took
her
place
in
the
darkness
for
her
remorse
demanded
even
this
from
her
nor
was
the
trick
discovered
then
iseult
lived
as
a
queen
but
lived
in
sadness
she
had
king
mark
s
tenderness
and
the
barons
honour
the
people
also
loved
her
she
passed
her
days
amid
the
frescoes
on
the
walls
and
floors
all
strewn
with
flowers
good
jewels
had
she
and
purple
cloth
and
tapestry
of
hungary
and
thessaly
too
and
songs
of
harpers
and
curtains
upon
which
were
worked
leopards
and
eagles
and
popinjays
and
all
the
beasts
of
sea
and
field
and
her
love
too
she
had
love
high
and
splendid
for
as
is
the
custom
among
great
lords
tristan
could
ever
be
near
her
at
his
leisure
and
his
dalliance
night
and
day
for
he
slept
in
the
king
s
chamber
as
great
lords
do
among
the
lieges
and
the
councillors
yet
still
she
feared
for
though
her
love
were
secret
and
tristan
unsuspected
for
who
suspects
a
son
brangien
knew
and
brangien
seemed
in
the
queen
s
mind
like
a
witness
spying
for
brangien
alone
knew
what
manner
of
life
she
led
and
held
her
at
mercy
so
and
the
queen
thought
ah
if
some
day
she
should
weary
of
serving
as
a
slave
the
bed
where
once
she
passed
for
queen
if
tristan
should
die
from
her
betrayal
so
fear
maddened
the
queen
but
not
in
truth
the
fear
of
brangien
who
was
loyal
her
own
heart
bred
the
fear
not
brangien
who
was
faithful
not
brangien
but
themselves
had
these
lovers
to
fear
for
hearts
so
stricken
will
lose
their
vigilance
love
pressed
them
hard
as
thirst
presses
the
dying
stag
to
the
stream
love
dropped
upon
them
from
high
heaven
as
a
hawk
slipped
after
long
hunger
falls
right
upon
the
bird
and
love
will
not
be
hidden
brangien
indeed
by
her
prudence
saved
them
well
nor
ever
were
the
queen
and
her
lover
unguarded
but
in
every
hour
and
place
every
man
could
see
love
terrible
that
rode
them
and
could
see
in
these
lovers
their
every
sense
overflowing
like
new
wine
working
in
the
vat
the
four
felons
at
court
who
had
hated
tristan
of
old
for
his
prowess
watched
the
queen
they
had
guessed
that
great
love
and
they
burnt
with
envy
and
hatred
and
now
a
kind
of
evil
joy
they
planned
to
give
news
of
their
watching
to
the
king
to
see
his
tenderness
turned
to
fury
tristan
thrust
out
or
slain
and
the
queen
in
torment
for
though
they
feared
tristan
their
hatred
mastered
their
fear
and
on
a
day
the
four
barons
called
king
mark
to
parley
and
andret
said
fair
king
your
heart
will
be
troubled
and
we
four
also
mourn
yet
are
we
bound
to
tell
you
what
we
know
you
have
placed
your
trust
in
tristan
and
tristan
would
shame
you
in
vain
we
warned
you
for
the
love
of
one
man
you
have
mocked
ties
of
blood
and
all
your
barony
learn
then
that
tristan
loves
the
queen
it
is
truth
proved
and
many
a
word
is
passing
on
it
the
royal
king
shrank
and
answered
coward
what
thought
was
that
indeed
i
have
placed
my
trust
in
tristan
and
rightly
for
on
the
day
when
the
morholt
offered
combat
to
you
all
you
hung
your
heads
and
were
dumb
and
you
trembled
before
him
but
tristan
dared
him
for
the
honour
of
this
land
and
took
mortal
wounds
therefore
do
you
hate
him
and
therefore
do
i
cherish
him
beyond
thee
andret
and
beyond
any
other
but
what
then
have
you
seen
or
heard
or
known
naught
lord
save
what
your
eyes
could
see
or
your
ears
hear
look
you
and
listen
sire
if
there
is
yet
and
they
left
him
to
taste
the
poison
then
king
mark
watched
the
queen
and
tristan
but
brangien
noting
it
warned
them
both
and
the
king
watched
in
vain
so
that
soon
wearying
of
an
ignoble
task
but
knowing
alas
that
he
could
not
kill
his
uneasy
thought
he
sent
for
tristan
and
said
tristan
leave
this
castle
and
having
left
it
remain
apart
and
do
not
think
to
return
to
it
and
do
not
repass
its
moat
or
boundaries
felons
have
charged
you
with
an
awful
treason
but
ask
me
nothing
i
could
not
speak
their
words
without
shame
to
us
both
and
for
your
part
seek
you
no
word
to
appease
i
have
not
believed
them
had
i
done
so
but
their
evil
words
have
troubled
all
my
soul
and
only
by
your
absence
can
my
disquiet
be
soothed
go
doubtless
i
will
soon
recall
you
go
my
son
you
are
still
dear
to
me
when
the
felons
heard
the
news
they
said
among
themselves
he
is
gone
the
wizard
he
is
driven
out
surely
he
will
cross
the
sea
on
far
adventures
to
carry
his
traitor
service
to
some
distant
but
tristan
had
not
strength
to
depart
altogether
and
when
he
had
crossed
the
moats
and
boundaries
of
the
castle
he
knew
he
could
go
no
further
he
stayed
in
tintagel
town
and
lodged
with
gorvenal
in
a
burgess
house
and
languished
oh
more
wounded
than
when
in
that
past
day
the
shaft
of
the
morholt
had
tainted
his
body
in
the
close
towers
iseult
the
fair
drooped
also
but
more
wretched
still
for
it
was
hers
all
day
long
to
feign
laughter
and
all
night
long
to
conquer
fever
and
despair
and
all
night
as
she
lay
by
king
mark
s
side
fever
still
kept
her
waking
and
she
stared
at
darkness
she
longed
to
fly
to
tristan
and
she
dreamt
dreams
of
running
to
the
gates
and
of
finding
there
sharp
scythes
traps
of
the
felons
that
cut
her
tender
knees
and
she
dreamt
of
weakness
and
falling
and
that
her
wounds
had
left
her
blood
upon
the
ground
now
these
lovers
would
have
died
but
brangien
succoured
them
at
peril
of
her
life
she
found
the
house
where
tristan
lay
there
gorvenal
opened
to
her
very
gladly
knowing
what
salvation
she
could
bring
so
she
found
tristan
and
to
save
the
lovers
she
taught
him
a
device
nor
was
ever
known
a
more
subtle
ruse
of
love
behind
the
castle
of
tintagel
was
an
orchard
fenced
around
and
wide
and
all
closed
in
with
stout
and
pointed
stakes
and
numberless
trees
were
there
and
fruit
on
them
birds
and
clusters
of
sweet
grapes
and
furthest
from
the
castle
by
the
stakes
of
the
pallisade
was
a
tall
straight
and
with
heavy
branches
spreading
from
its
trunk
at
its
root
a
living
spring
welled
calm
into
a
marble
round
then
ran
between
two
borders
winding
throughout
the
orchard
and
so
on
till
it
flowed
at
last
within
the
castle
and
through
the
women
s
rooms
and
every
evening
by
brangien
s
counsel
tristan
cut
him
twigs
and
bark
leapt
the
sharp
stakes
and
having
come
beneath
the
pine
threw
them
into
the
clear
spring
they
floated
light
as
foam
down
the
stream
to
the
women
s
rooms
and
iseult
watched
for
their
coming
and
on
those
evenings
she
would
wander
out
into
the
orchard
and
find
her
friend
lithe
and
in
fear
would
she
come
watching
at
every
step
for
what
might
lurk
in
the
trees
observing
foes
or
the
felons
whom
she
knew
till
she
spied
tristan
and
the
night
and
the
branches
of
the
pine
protected
them
and
so
she
said
one
night
oh
tristan
i
have
heard
that
the
castle
is
faëry
and
that
twice
a
year
it
vanishes
away
so
is
it
vanished
now
and
this
is
that
enchanted
orchard
of
which
the
harpers
and
as
she
said
it
the
sentinels
bugled
dawn
iseult
had
refound
her
joy
mark
s
thought
of
grew
faint
but
the
felons
felt
or
knew
which
way
lay
truth
and
they
guessed
that
tristan
had
met
the
queen
till
at
last
duke
andret
whom
god
shame
said
to
his
peers
my
lords
let
us
take
counsel
of
frocin
the
dwarf
for
he
knows
the
seven
arts
and
magic
and
every
kind
of
charm
he
will
teach
us
if
he
will
the
wiles
of
iseult
the
the
little
evil
man
drew
signs
for
them
and
characters
of
sorcery
he
cast
the
fortunes
of
the
hour
and
then
at
last
he
said
sirs
high
good
lords
this
night
shall
you
seize
them
then
they
led
the
little
wizard
to
the
king
and
he
said
sire
bid
your
huntsmen
leash
the
hounds
and
saddle
the
horses
proclaim
a
seven
days
hunt
in
the
forest
and
seven
nights
abroad
therein
and
hang
me
high
if
you
do
not
hear
this
night
what
converse
tristan
so
did
the
king
unwillingly
and
at
fall
of
night
he
left
the
hunt
taking
the
dwarf
in
pillion
and
entered
the
orchard
and
the
dwarf
took
him
to
the
tall
saying
fair
king
climb
into
these
branches
and
take
with
you
your
arrows
and
your
bow
for
you
may
need
them
and
bide
you
that
night
the
moon
shone
clear
hid
in
the
branches
the
king
saw
his
nephew
leap
the
pallisades
and
throw
his
bark
and
twigs
into
the
stream
but
tristan
had
bent
over
the
round
well
to
throw
them
and
so
doing
had
seen
the
image
of
the
king
he
could
not
stop
the
branches
as
they
floated
away
and
there
yonder
in
the
women
s
rooms
iseult
was
watching
and
would
come
she
came
and
tristan
watched
her
motionless
above
him
in
the
tree
he
heard
the
click
of
the
arrow
when
it
fits
the
string
she
came
but
with
more
prudence
than
her
wont
thinking
what
has
passed
that
tristan
does
not
come
to
meet
me
he
has
seen
some
suddenly
by
the
clear
moonshine
she
also
saw
the
king
s
shadow
in
the
fount
she
showed
the
wit
of
women
well
she
did
not
lift
her
eyes
lord
god
she
said
low
down
grant
i
may
be
the
first
to
tristan
she
said
what
have
you
dared
to
do
calling
me
hither
at
such
an
hour
often
have
you
called
me
beseech
you
said
and
queen
though
i
am
i
know
you
won
me
that
i
have
come
what
would
you
queen
i
would
have
you
pray
the
king
for
she
was
in
tears
and
trembling
but
tristan
praised
god
the
lord
who
had
shown
his
friend
her
peril
queen
he
went
on
often
and
in
vain
have
i
summoned
you
never
would
you
come
take
pity
the
king
hates
me
and
i
know
not
why
perhaps
you
know
the
cause
and
can
charm
his
anger
for
whom
can
he
trust
if
not
you
chaste
queen
and
courteous
iseult
truly
lord
tristan
you
do
not
know
he
doubts
us
both
and
i
to
add
to
my
shame
must
acquaint
you
of
it
ah
but
god
knows
if
i
lie
never
went
cut
my
love
to
any
man
but
he
that
first
received
me
and
would
you
have
me
at
such
a
time
implore
your
pardon
of
the
king
why
did
he
know
of
my
passage
here
he
would
cast
my
ashes
to
the
wind
my
body
trembles
and
i
am
afraid
i
go
for
i
have
waited
too
in
the
branches
the
king
smiled
and
had
pity
and
as
iseult
fled
queen
said
tristan
in
the
lord
s
name
help
me
for
friend
she
replied
god
aid
you
the
king
wrongs
you
but
the
lord
god
will
be
by
you
in
whatever
land
you
so
she
went
back
to
the
women
s
rooms
and
told
it
to
brangien
who
cried
iseult
god
has
worked
a
miracle
for
you
for
he
is
compassionate
and
will
not
hurt
the
innocent
in
and
when
he
had
left
the
orchard
the
king
said
smiling
fair
nephew
that
ride
you
planned
is
over
but
in
an
open
glade
apart
frocin
the
dwarf
read
in
the
clear
stars
that
the
king
now
meant
his
death
he
blackened
with
shame
and
fear
and
fled
into
wales
the
discovery
king
mark
made
peace
with
tristan
tristan
returned
to
the
castle
as
of
old
tristan
slept
in
the
king
s
chamber
with
his
peers
he
could
come
or
go
the
king
thought
no
more
of
it
mark
had
pardoned
the
felons
and
as
the
seneschal
dinas
of
lidan
found
the
dwarf
wandering
in
a
forest
abandoned
he
brought
him
home
and
the
king
had
pity
and
pardoned
even
him
but
his
goodness
did
but
feed
the
ire
of
the
barons
who
swore
this
oath
if
the
king
kept
tristan
in
the
land
they
would
withdraw
to
their
strongholds
as
for
war
and
they
called
the
king
to
parley
lord
said
they
drive
you
tristan
forth
he
loves
the
queen
as
all
who
choose
can
see
but
as
for
us
we
will
bear
it
no
and
the
king
sighed
looking
down
in
silence
king
they
went
on
we
will
not
bear
it
for
we
know
now
that
this
is
known
to
you
and
that
yet
you
will
not
move
parley
you
and
take
counsel
as
for
us
if
you
will
not
exile
this
man
your
nephew
and
drive
him
forth
out
of
your
land
forever
we
will
withdraw
within
our
bailiwicks
and
take
our
neighbours
also
from
your
court
for
we
can
not
endure
his
presence
longer
in
this
place
such
is
your
balance
my
lords
said
he
once
i
hearkened
to
the
evil
words
you
spoke
of
tristan
yet
was
i
wrong
in
the
end
but
you
are
my
lieges
and
i
would
not
lose
the
service
of
my
men
counsel
me
therefore
i
charge
you
you
that
owe
me
counsel
you
know
me
for
a
man
neither
proud
nor
lord
said
they
call
then
frocin
hither
you
mistrust
him
for
that
orchard
night
still
was
it
not
he
that
read
in
the
stars
of
the
queen
s
coming
there
and
to
the
very
too
he
is
very
wise
take
counsel
of
and
he
came
did
that
hunchback
of
hell
the
felons
greeted
him
and
he
planned
this
evil
sire
said
he
let
your
nephew
ride
hard
at
dawn
with
a
brief
drawn
up
on
parchment
and
well
sealed
with
a
seal
bid
him
ride
to
king
arthur
at
carduel
sire
he
sleeps
with
the
peers
in
your
chamber
go
you
out
when
the
first
sleep
falls
on
men
and
if
he
love
iseult
so
madly
why
then
i
swear
by
god
and
by
the
laws
of
rome
he
will
try
to
speak
with
her
before
he
rides
but
if
he
do
so
unknown
to
you
or
to
me
then
slay
me
as
for
the
trap
let
me
lay
it
but
do
you
say
nothing
of
his
ride
to
him
until
the
time
for
and
when
king
mark
had
agreed
this
dwarf
did
a
vile
thing
he
bought
of
a
baker
four
farthings
worth
of
flour
and
hid
it
in
the
turn
of
his
coat
that
night
when
the
king
had
supped
and
the
lay
down
to
sleep
in
hall
tristan
came
to
the
king
as
custom
was
and
the
king
said
fair
nephew
do
my
will
ride
night
to
king
arthur
at
carduel
and
give
him
this
brief
with
my
greeting
that
he
may
open
it
and
stay
you
with
him
but
one
and
when
tristan
said
i
will
take
it
on
the
morrow
the
king
added
aye
and
before
day
but
as
the
peers
slept
all
round
the
king
their
lord
that
night
a
mad
thought
took
tristan
that
before
he
rode
he
knew
not
for
how
long
before
dawn
he
would
say
a
last
word
to
the
queen
and
there
was
a
spear
length
in
the
darkness
between
them
now
the
dwarf
slept
with
the
rest
in
the
king
s
chamber
and
when
he
thought
that
all
slept
he
rose
and
scattered
the
flour
silently
in
the
spear
length
that
lay
between
tristan
and
the
queen
but
tristan
watched
and
saw
him
and
said
to
himself
it
is
to
mark
my
footsteps
but
there
shall
be
no
marks
to
at
midnight
when
all
was
dark
in
the
room
no
candle
nor
any
lamp
glimmering
the
king
went
out
silently
by
the
door
and
with
him
the
dwarf
then
tristan
rose
in
the
darkness
and
judged
the
spear
length
and
leapt
the
space
between
for
his
farewell
but
that
day
in
the
hunt
a
boar
had
wounded
him
in
the
leg
and
in
this
effort
the
wound
bled
he
did
not
feel
it
or
see
it
in
the
darkness
but
the
blood
dripped
upon
the
couches
and
the
flour
strewn
between
and
outside
in
the
moonlight
the
dwarf
read
the
heavens
and
knew
what
had
been
done
and
he
cried
enter
my
king
and
if
you
do
not
hold
them
hang
me
then
the
king
and
the
dwarf
and
the
four
felons
ran
in
with
lights
and
noise
and
though
tristan
had
regained
his
place
there
was
the
blood
for
witness
and
though
iseult
feigned
sleep
and
perinis
too
who
lay
at
tristan
s
feet
yet
there
was
the
blood
for
witness
and
the
king
looked
in
silence
at
the
blood
where
it
lay
upon
the
bed
and
the
boards
and
trampled
into
the
flour
and
the
four
barons
held
tristan
down
upon
his
bed
and
mocked
the
queen
also
promising
her
full
justice
and
they
bared
and
showed
the
wound
whence
the
blood
flowed
then
the
king
said
tristan
now
nothing
longer
holds
you
shall
and
tristan
answered
have
mercy
lord
in
the
name
of
god
that
suffered
the
cross
but
the
felons
called
on
the
king
to
take
vengeance
saying
do
justice
king
take
and
tristan
went
on
have
mercy
not
on
why
should
i
stand
at
dying
but
for
you
i
would
have
sold
my
honour
high
to
cowards
who
under
your
peace
have
put
hands
on
my
in
homage
to
you
i
have
yielded
and
you
may
do
with
me
what
you
will
but
lord
remember
the
queen
and
as
he
knelt
at
the
king
s
feet
he
still
complained
remember
the
queen
for
if
any
man
of
your
household
make
so
bold
as
to
maintain
the
lie
that
i
loved
her
unlawfully
i
will
stand
up
armed
to
him
in
a
ring
sire
in
the
name
of
god
the
lord
have
mercy
on
then
the
barons
bound
him
with
ropes
and
the
queen
also
but
had
tristan
known
that
trial
by
combat
was
to
be
denied
him
certainly
he
would
not
have
suffered
it
for
he
trusted
in
god
and
knew
no
man
dared
draw
sword
against
him
in
the
lists
and
truly
he
did
well
to
trust
in
god
for
though
the
felons
mocked
him
when
he
said
he
had
loved
loyally
yet
i
call
you
to
witness
my
lords
who
read
this
and
who
know
of
the
philtre
drunk
upon
the
high
seas
and
who
understand
whether
his
love
were
disloyalty
indeed
for
men
see
this
and
that
outward
thing
but
god
alone
the
heart
and
in
the
heart
alone
is
crime
and
the
sole
final
judge
is
god
therefore
did
he
lay
down
the
law
that
a
man
accused
might
uphold
his
cause
by
battle
and
god
himself
fights
for
the
innocent
in
such
a
combat
therefore
did
tristan
claim
justice
and
the
right
of
battle
and
therefore
was
he
careful
to
fail
in
nothing
of
the
homage
he
owed
king
mark
his
lord
but
had
he
known
what
was
coming
he
would
have
killed
the
felons
the
chantry
leap
dark
was
the
night
and
the
news
ran
that
tristan
and
the
queen
were
held
and
that
the
king
would
kill
them
and
wealthy
burgess
or
common
man
they
wept
and
ran
to
the
palace
and
the
murmurs
and
the
cries
ran
through
the
city
but
such
was
the
king
s
anger
in
his
castle
above
that
not
the
strongest
nor
the
proudest
baron
dared
move
him
night
ended
and
the
day
drew
near
mark
before
dawn
rode
out
to
the
place
where
he
held
pleas
and
judgment
he
ordered
a
ditch
to
be
dug
in
the
earth
and
knotty
and
thorns
to
be
laid
therein
at
the
hour
of
prime
he
had
a
ban
cried
through
his
land
to
gather
the
men
of
cornwall
they
came
with
a
great
noise
and
the
king
spoke
them
thus
my
lords
i
have
made
here
a
faggot
of
thorns
for
tristan
and
the
queen
for
they
have
but
they
cried
all
with
tears
a
sentence
lord
a
sentence
an
indictment
and
pleas
for
killing
without
trial
is
shame
and
but
mark
answered
in
his
anger
neither
respite
nor
delay
nor
pleas
nor
sentence
by
god
that
made
the
world
if
any
dare
petition
me
he
shall
burn
first
he
ordered
the
fire
to
be
lit
and
tristan
to
be
called
the
flames
rose
and
all
were
silent
before
the
flames
and
the
king
waited
the
servants
ran
to
the
room
where
watch
was
kept
on
the
two
lovers
and
they
dragged
tristan
out
by
his
hands
though
he
wept
for
his
honour
but
as
they
dragged
him
off
in
such
a
shame
the
queen
still
called
to
him
friend
if
i
die
that
you
may
live
that
will
be
great
now
hear
how
full
of
pity
is
god
and
how
he
heard
the
lament
and
the
prayers
of
the
common
folk
that
day
for
as
tristan
and
his
guards
went
down
from
the
town
to
where
the
faggot
burned
near
the
road
upon
a
rock
was
a
chantry
it
stood
at
a
cliff
s
edge
steep
and
sheer
and
it
turned
to
the
in
the
apse
of
it
were
windows
glazed
then
tristan
said
to
those
with
him
my
lords
let
me
enter
this
chantry
to
pray
for
a
moment
the
mercy
of
god
whom
i
have
offended
my
death
is
near
there
is
but
one
door
to
the
place
my
lords
and
each
of
you
has
his
sword
drawn
so
you
may
well
see
that
when
my
prayer
to
god
is
done
i
must
come
past
you
again
when
i
have
prayed
god
my
lords
for
the
last
time
and
one
of
the
guards
said
why
let
him
go
so
they
let
him
enter
to
pray
but
he
once
in
dashed
through
and
leapt
the
altar
rail
and
the
altar
too
and
forced
a
window
of
the
apse
and
leapt
again
over
the
cliff
s
edge
so
might
he
die
but
not
of
that
shameful
death
before
the
people
now
learn
my
lords
how
generous
was
god
to
him
that
day
the
wind
took
tristan
s
cloak
and
he
fell
upon
a
smooth
rock
at
the
cliff
s
foot
which
to
this
day
the
men
of
cornwall
call
tristan
s
his
guards
still
waited
for
him
at
the
chantry
door
but
vainly
for
god
was
now
his
guard
and
he
ran
and
the
fine
sand
crunched
under
his
feet
and
far
off
he
saw
the
faggot
burning
and
the
smoke
and
the
crackling
flames
and
fled
sword
girt
and
bridle
loose
gorvenal
had
fled
the
city
lest
the
king
burn
him
in
his
master
s
place
and
he
found
tristan
on
the
shore
master
said
tristan
god
has
saved
me
but
oh
master
to
what
end
for
without
iseult
i
may
not
and
i
will
not
live
and
i
rather
had
died
of
my
fall
they
will
burn
her
for
me
then
i
too
will
die
for
lord
said
gorvenal
take
no
counsel
of
anger
see
here
this
thicket
with
a
ditch
dug
round
about
it
let
us
hide
therein
where
the
track
passes
near
and
comers
by
it
will
tell
us
news
and
boy
if
they
burn
iseult
i
swear
by
god
the
son
of
mary
never
to
sleep
under
a
roof
again
until
she
be
there
was
a
poor
man
of
the
common
folk
that
had
seen
tristan
s
fall
and
had
seen
him
stumble
and
rise
after
and
he
crept
to
tintagel
and
to
iseult
where
she
was
bound
and
said
queen
weep
no
more
your
friend
has
fled
then
i
thank
god
said
she
and
whether
they
bind
or
loose
me
and
whether
they
kill
or
spare
me
i
care
but
little
and
though
blood
came
at
the
so
tightly
had
the
traitors
bound
her
yet
still
she
said
smiling
did
i
weep
for
that
when
god
has
loosed
my
friend
i
should
be
little
when
the
news
came
to
the
king
that
tristan
had
leapt
that
leap
and
was
lost
he
paled
with
anger
and
bade
his
men
bring
forth
iseult
they
dragged
her
from
the
room
and
she
came
before
the
crowd
held
by
her
delicate
hands
from
which
blood
dropped
and
the
crowd
called
have
pity
on
loyal
queen
and
honoured
surely
they
that
gave
her
up
brought
mourning
on
us
curses
on
them
but
the
king
s
men
dragged
her
to
the
thorn
faggot
as
it
blazed
she
stood
up
before
the
flame
and
the
crowd
cried
its
anger
and
cursed
the
traitors
and
the
king
none
could
see
her
without
pity
unless
he
had
a
felon
s
heart
she
was
so
tightly
bound
the
tears
ran
down
her
face
and
fell
upon
her
grey
gown
where
ran
a
little
thread
of
gold
and
a
thread
of
gold
was
twined
into
her
hair
just
then
there
had
come
up
a
hundred
lepers
of
the
king
s
deformed
and
broken
white
horribly
and
limping
on
their
crutches
and
they
drew
near
the
flame
and
being
evil
loved
the
sight
and
their
chief
ivan
the
ugliest
of
them
all
cried
to
the
king
in
a
quavering
voice
o
king
you
would
burn
this
woman
in
that
flame
and
it
is
sound
justice
but
too
swift
for
very
soon
the
fire
will
fall
and
her
ashes
will
very
soon
be
scattered
by
the
high
wind
and
her
agony
be
done
throw
her
rather
to
your
lepers
where
she
may
drag
out
a
life
for
ever
asking
and
the
king
answered
yes
let
her
live
that
life
for
it
is
better
justice
and
more
terrible
i
can
love
those
that
gave
me
such
a
and
the
lepers
answered
throw
her
among
us
and
make
her
one
of
us
never
shall
lady
have
known
a
worse
end
and
look
they
said
at
our
rags
and
our
abominations
she
has
had
pleasure
in
rich
stuffs
and
furs
jewels
and
walls
of
marble
honour
good
wines
and
joy
but
when
she
sees
your
lepers
always
king
and
only
them
for
ever
their
couches
and
their
huts
then
indeed
she
will
know
the
wrong
she
has
done
and
bitterly
desire
even
that
great
flame
of
and
as
the
king
heard
them
he
stood
a
long
time
without
moving
then
he
ran
to
the
queen
and
seized
her
by
the
hand
and
she
cried
burn
me
rather
burn
me
but
the
king
gave
her
up
and
ivan
took
her
and
the
hundred
lepers
pressed
around
and
to
hear
her
cries
all
the
crowd
rose
in
pity
but
ivan
had
an
evil
gladness
and
as
he
went
he
dragged
her
out
of
the
borough
bounds
with
his
hideous
company
now
they
took
that
road
where
tristan
lay
in
hiding
and
gorvenal
said
to
him
son
here
is
your
friend
will
you
do
naught
then
tristan
mounted
the
horse
and
spurred
it
out
of
the
bush
and
cried
ivan
you
have
been
at
the
queen
s
side
a
moment
and
too
long
now
leave
her
if
you
would
but
ivan
threw
his
cloak
away
and
shouted
your
clubs
comrades
and
your
staves
crutches
in
the
a
fight
is
on
then
it
was
fine
to
see
the
lepers
throwing
their
capes
aside
and
stirring
their
sick
legs
and
brandishing
their
crutches
some
threatening
groaning
all
but
to
strike
them
tristan
was
too
noble
there
are
singers
who
sing
that
tristan
killed
ivan
but
it
is
a
lie
too
much
a
knight
was
he
to
kill
such
things
gorvenal
indeed
snatching
up
an
oak
sapling
crashed
it
on
ivan
s
head
till
his
blood
ran
down
to
his
misshapen
feet
then
tristan
took
the
queen
henceforth
near
him
she
felt
no
further
evil
he
cut
the
cords
that
bound
her
arms
so
straightly
and
he
left
the
plain
so
that
they
plunged
into
the
wood
of
morois
and
there
in
the
thick
wood
tristan
was
as
sure
as
in
a
castle
keep
and
as
the
sun
fell
they
halted
all
three
at
the
foot
of
a
little
hill
fear
had
wearied
the
queen
and
she
leant
her
head
upon
his
body
and
slept
but
in
the
morning
gorvenal
stole
from
a
wood
man
his
bow
and
two
good
arrows
plumed
and
barbed
and
gave
them
to
tristan
the
great
archer
and
he
shot
him
a
fawn
and
killed
it
then
gorvenal
gathered
dry
twigs
struck
flint
and
lit
a
great
fire
to
cook
the
venison
and
tristan
cut
him
branches
and
made
a
hut
and
garnished
it
with
leaves
and
iseult
slept
upon
the
thick
leaves
there
so
in
the
depths
of
the
wild
wood
began
for
the
lovers
that
savage
life
which
yet
they
loved
very
soon
part
the
second
the
wood
of
morois
they
wandered
in
the
depths
of
the
wild
wood
restless
and
in
haste
like
beasts
that
are
hunted
nor
did
they
often
dare
to
return
by
night
to
the
shelter
of
yesterday
they
ate
but
the
flesh
of
wild
animals
their
faces
sank
and
grew
white
their
clothes
ragged
for
the
briars
tore
them
they
loved
each
other
and
they
did
not
know
that
they
suffered
one
day
as
they
were
wandering
in
these
high
woods
that
had
never
yet
been
felled
or
ordered
they
came
upon
the
hermitage
of
ogrin
the
old
man
limped
in
the
sunlight
under
a
light
growth
of
maples
near
his
chapel
he
leant
upon
his
crutch
and
cried
lord
tristan
hear
the
great
oath
which
the
cornish
men
have
sworn
the
king
has
published
a
ban
in
every
parish
whosoever
may
seize
you
shall
receive
a
hundred
marks
of
gold
for
his
guerdon
and
all
the
barons
have
sworn
to
give
you
up
alive
or
dead
do
penance
tristan
god
pardons
the
sinner
who
turns
to
and
of
what
should
i
repent
ogrin
my
lord
or
of
what
crime
you
that
sit
in
judgment
upon
us
here
do
you
know
what
cup
it
was
we
drank
upon
the
high
sea
that
good
great
draught
inebriates
us
both
i
would
rather
beg
my
life
long
and
live
of
roots
and
herbs
with
iseult
than
lacking
her
be
king
of
a
wide
god
aid
you
lord
tristan
for
you
have
lost
both
this
world
and
the
next
a
man
that
is
traitor
to
his
lord
is
worthy
to
be
torn
by
horses
and
burnt
upon
the
faggot
and
wherever
his
ashes
fall
no
grass
shall
grow
and
all
tillage
is
waste
and
the
trees
and
the
green
things
die
lord
tristan
give
back
the
queen
to
the
man
who
espoused
her
lawfully
according
to
the
laws
of
he
gave
her
to
his
lepers
from
these
lepers
i
myself
conquered
her
with
my
own
hand
and
henceforth
she
is
altogether
mine
she
can
not
pass
from
me
nor
i
from
ogrin
sat
down
but
at
his
feet
iseult
her
head
upon
the
knees
of
that
man
of
god
wept
silently
the
hermit
told
her
and
her
the
words
of
his
holy
book
but
still
while
she
wept
she
shook
her
head
and
refused
the
faith
he
offered
ah
me
said
ogrin
then
what
comfort
can
one
give
the
dead
do
penance
tristan
for
a
man
who
lives
in
sin
without
repenting
is
a
man
quite
oh
no
said
tristan
i
live
and
i
do
no
penance
we
will
go
back
into
the
high
wood
which
comforts
and
wards
us
all
round
about
come
with
me
iseult
my
iseult
rose
up
they
held
each
other
s
hands
they
passed
into
the
high
grass
and
the
underwood
the
trees
hid
them
with
their
branches
they
disappeared
beyond
the
leaves
the
summer
passed
and
the
winter
came
the
two
lovers
lived
all
hidden
in
the
hollow
of
a
rock
and
on
the
frozen
earth
the
cold
crisped
their
couch
with
dead
leaves
in
the
strength
of
their
love
neither
one
nor
the
other
felt
these
mortal
things
but
when
the
open
skies
had
come
back
with
the
springtime
they
built
a
hut
of
green
branches
under
the
great
trees
tristan
had
known
ever
since
his
childhood
that
art
by
which
a
man
may
sing
the
song
of
birds
in
the
woods
and
at
his
fancy
he
would
call
as
call
the
thrush
the
blackbird
and
the
nightingale
and
all
winged
things
and
sometimes
in
reply
very
many
birds
would
come
on
to
the
branches
of
his
hut
and
sing
their
song
in
the
new
light
the
lovers
had
ceased
to
wander
through
the
forest
for
none
of
the
barons
ran
the
risk
of
their
pursuit
knowing
well
that
tristan
would
have
hanged
them
to
the
branches
of
a
tree
one
day
however
one
of
the
four
traitors
guenelon
whom
god
blast
drawn
by
the
heat
of
the
hunt
dared
enter
the
morois
and
that
morning
on
the
forest
edge
in
a
ravine
gorvenal
having
unsaddled
his
horse
had
let
him
graze
on
the
new
grass
while
far
off
in
their
hut
tristan
held
the
queen
and
they
slept
then
suddenly
gorvenal
heard
the
cry
of
the
pack
the
hounds
pursued
a
deer
which
fell
into
that
ravine
and
far
on
the
heath
the
hunter
showed
and
gorvenal
knew
him
for
the
man
whom
his
master
hated
above
all
alone
with
bloody
spurs
and
striking
his
horse
s
mane
he
galloped
on
but
gorvenal
watched
him
from
ambush
he
came
fast
he
would
return
more
slowly
he
passed
and
gorvenal
leapt
from
his
ambush
and
seized
the
rein
and
suddenly
remembering
all
the
wrong
that
man
had
done
hewed
him
to
death
and
carried
off
his
head
in
his
hands
and
when
the
hunters
found
the
body
as
they
followed
they
thought
tristan
came
after
and
they
fled
in
fear
of
death
and
thereafter
no
man
hunted
in
that
wood
and
far
off
in
the
hut
upon
their
couch
of
leaves
slept
tristan
and
the
queen
there
came
gorvenal
noiseless
the
dead
man
s
head
in
his
hands
that
he
might
lift
his
master
s
heart
at
his
awakening
he
hung
it
by
its
hair
outside
the
hut
and
the
leaves
garlanded
it
about
tristan
woke
and
saw
it
half
hidden
in
the
leaves
and
staring
at
him
as
he
gazed
and
he
became
afraid
but
gorvenal
said
fear
not
he
is
dead
i
killed
him
with
this
then
tristan
was
glad
and
henceforward
from
that
day
no
one
dared
enter
the
wild
wood
for
terror
guarded
it
and
the
lovers
were
lords
of
it
all
and
then
it
was
that
tristan
fashioned
his
bow
failnaught
which
struck
home
always
man
or
beast
whatever
it
aimed
at
my
lords
upon
a
summer
day
when
mowing
is
a
little
after
whitsuntide
as
the
birds
sang
dawn
tristan
left
his
hut
and
girt
his
sword
on
him
and
took
his
bow
failnaught
and
went
off
to
hunt
in
the
wood
but
before
evening
great
evil
was
to
fall
on
him
for
no
lovers
ever
loved
so
much
or
paid
their
love
so
dear
when
tristan
came
back
broken
by
the
heat
the
queen
said
friend
where
have
you
been
hunting
a
hart
he
said
that
wearied
me
i
would
lie
down
and
so
she
lay
down
and
he
and
between
them
tristan
put
his
naked
sword
and
on
the
queen
s
finger
was
that
ring
of
gold
with
emeralds
set
therein
which
mark
had
given
her
on
her
bridal
day
but
her
hand
was
so
wasted
that
the
ring
hardly
held
and
no
wind
blew
and
no
leaves
stirred
but
through
a
crevice
in
the
branches
a
sunbeam
fell
upon
the
face
of
iseult
and
it
shone
white
like
ice
now
a
woodman
found
in
the
wood
a
place
where
the
leaves
were
crushed
where
the
lovers
had
halted
and
slept
and
he
followed
their
track
and
found
the
hut
and
saw
them
sleeping
and
fled
off
fearing
the
terrible
awakening
of
that
lord
he
fled
to
tintagel
and
going
up
the
stairs
of
the
palace
found
the
king
as
he
held
his
pleas
in
hall
amid
the
vassals
assembled
friend
said
the
king
what
came
you
hither
to
seek
in
haste
and
breathless
like
a
huntsman
that
has
followed
the
dogs
afoot
have
you
some
wrong
to
right
or
has
any
man
driven
you
but
the
woodman
took
him
aside
and
said
low
down
i
have
seen
the
queen
and
tristan
and
i
feared
and
where
saw
you
them
in
a
hut
in
morois
they
slept
side
by
side
come
swiftly
and
take
your
go
said
the
king
and
await
me
at
the
forest
edge
where
the
red
cross
stands
and
tell
no
man
what
you
have
seen
you
shall
have
gold
and
silver
at
your
the
king
had
saddled
his
horse
and
girt
his
sword
and
left
the
city
alone
and
as
he
rode
alone
he
minded
him
of
the
night
when
he
had
seen
tristan
under
the
great
and
iseult
with
her
clear
face
and
he
thought
if
i
find
them
i
will
avenge
this
awful
at
the
foot
of
the
red
cross
he
came
to
the
woodman
and
said
go
first
and
lead
me
straight
and
the
dark
shade
of
the
great
trees
wrapt
them
round
and
as
the
king
followed
the
spy
he
felt
his
sword
and
trusted
it
for
the
great
blows
it
had
struck
of
old
and
surely
had
tristan
wakened
one
of
the
two
had
stayed
there
dead
then
the
woodman
said
king
we
are
he
held
the
stirrup
and
tied
the
rein
to
a
green
and
saw
in
a
sunlit
glade
the
hut
with
its
flowers
and
leaves
then
the
king
cast
his
cloak
with
its
fine
buckle
of
gold
and
drew
his
sword
from
its
sheath
and
said
again
in
his
heart
that
they
or
he
should
die
and
he
signed
to
the
woodman
to
be
gone
he
came
alone
into
the
hut
sword
bare
and
watched
them
as
they
lay
but
he
saw
that
they
were
apart
and
he
wondered
because
between
them
was
the
naked
blade
then
he
said
to
himself
my
god
i
may
not
kill
them
for
all
the
time
they
have
lived
together
in
this
wood
these
two
lovers
yet
is
the
sword
here
between
them
and
throughout
christendom
men
know
that
sign
therefore
i
will
not
slay
for
that
would
be
treason
and
wrong
but
i
will
do
so
that
when
they
wake
they
may
know
that
i
found
them
here
asleep
and
spared
them
and
that
god
had
pity
on
them
and
still
the
sunbeam
fell
upon
the
white
face
of
iseult
and
the
king
took
his
ermined
gloves
and
put
them
up
against
the
crevice
whence
it
shone
then
in
her
sleep
a
vision
came
to
iseult
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
great
wood
and
two
lions
near
her
fought
for
her
and
she
gave
a
cry
and
woke
and
the
gloves
fell
upon
her
breast
and
at
the
cry
tristan
woke
and
made
to
seize
his
sword
and
saw
by
the
golden
hilt
that
it
was
the
king
s
and
the
queen
saw
on
her
finger
the
king
s
ring
and
she
cried
o
my
lord
the
king
has
found
us
here
and
tristan
said
he
has
taken
my
sword
he
was
alone
but
he
will
return
and
will
burn
us
before
the
people
let
us
so
by
great
marches
with
gorvenal
alone
they
fled
towards
wales
ogrin
the
hermit
after
three
days
it
happened
that
tristan
in
following
a
wounded
deer
far
out
into
the
wood
was
caught
by
and
took
to
thinking
thus
under
the
dark
wood
alone
it
was
not
fear
that
moved
the
king
he
had
my
sword
and
i
slept
and
had
he
wished
to
slay
why
did
he
leave
me
his
own
blade
o
my
father
my
father
i
know
you
now
there
was
pardon
in
your
heart
and
tenderness
and
pity
yet
how
was
that
for
who
could
forgive
in
this
matter
without
shame
it
was
not
pardon
it
was
understanding
the
faggot
and
the
chantry
leap
and
the
leper
ambush
have
shown
him
god
upon
our
side
also
i
think
he
remembered
the
boy
who
long
ago
harped
at
his
feet
and
my
land
of
lyonesse
which
i
left
for
him
the
morholt
s
spear
and
blood
shed
in
his
honour
he
remembered
how
i
made
no
avowal
but
claimed
a
trial
at
arms
and
the
high
nature
of
his
heart
has
made
him
understand
what
men
around
him
can
not
never
can
he
know
of
the
spell
yet
he
doubts
and
hopes
and
knows
i
have
told
no
lie
and
would
have
me
prove
my
cause
o
but
to
win
at
arms
by
god
s
aid
for
him
and
to
enter
his
peace
and
to
put
on
mail
for
him
again
but
then
he
must
take
her
back
and
i
must
yield
her
it
would
have
been
much
better
had
he
killed
me
in
my
sleep
for
till
now
i
was
hunted
and
i
could
hate
and
forget
he
had
thrown
iseult
to
the
lepers
she
was
no
more
his
but
mine
and
now
by
his
compassion
he
has
wakened
my
heart
and
regained
the
queen
for
queen
she
was
at
his
side
but
in
this
wood
she
lives
a
slave
and
i
waste
her
youth
and
for
rooms
all
hung
with
silk
she
has
this
savage
place
and
a
hut
for
her
splendid
walls
and
i
am
the
cause
that
she
treads
this
ugly
road
so
now
i
cry
to
god
the
lord
who
is
king
of
the
world
and
beg
him
to
give
me
strength
to
yield
back
iseult
to
king
mark
for
she
is
indeed
his
wife
wed
according
to
the
laws
of
rome
before
all
the
barony
of
his
and
as
he
thought
thus
he
leant
upon
his
bow
and
all
through
the
night
considered
his
sorrow
within
the
hollow
of
thorns
that
was
their
iseult
the
fair
awaited
tristan
s
return
the
golden
ring
that
king
mark
had
slipped
there
glistened
on
her
finger
in
the
moonlight
and
she
thought
he
that
put
on
this
ring
is
not
the
man
who
threw
me
to
his
lepers
in
his
wrath
he
is
rather
that
compassionate
lord
who
from
the
day
i
touched
his
shore
received
me
and
protected
and
he
loved
tristan
once
but
i
came
and
see
what
i
have
done
he
should
have
lived
in
the
king
s
palace
he
should
have
ridden
through
king
s
and
baron
s
fees
finding
adventure
but
through
me
he
has
forgotten
his
knighthood
and
is
hunted
and
exiled
from
the
court
leading
a
random
life
just
then
she
heard
the
feet
of
tristan
coming
over
the
dead
leaves
and
twigs
she
came
to
meet
him
as
was
her
wont
to
relieve
him
of
his
arms
and
she
took
from
him
his
bow
failnaught
and
his
arrows
and
she
unbuckled
his
and
friend
said
he
it
is
the
king
s
sword
it
should
have
slain
but
it
spared
iseult
took
the
sword
and
kissed
the
hilt
of
gold
and
tristan
saw
her
weeping
friend
said
he
if
i
could
make
my
peace
with
the
king
if
he
would
allow
me
to
sustain
in
arms
that
neither
by
act
nor
word
have
i
loved
you
with
a
wrongful
love
any
knight
from
the
marshes
of
ely
right
away
to
dureaume
that
would
gainsay
me
would
find
me
armed
in
the
ring
then
if
the
king
would
keep
you
and
drive
me
out
i
would
cross
to
the
lowlands
or
to
brittany
with
gorvenal
alone
but
wherever
i
went
and
always
queen
i
should
be
yours
nor
would
i
have
spoken
thus
iseult
but
for
the
wretchedness
you
bear
so
long
for
my
sake
in
this
desert
tristan
she
said
there
is
the
hermit
ogrin
let
us
return
to
him
and
cry
mercy
to
the
king
of
they
wakened
gorvenal
iseult
mounted
the
steed
and
tristan
led
it
by
the
bridle
and
all
night
long
they
went
for
the
last
time
through
the
woods
of
their
love
and
they
did
not
speak
a
word
by
morning
they
came
to
the
hermitage
where
ogrin
read
at
the
threshold
and
seeing
them
called
them
tenderly
friends
he
cried
see
how
love
drives
you
still
to
further
wretchedness
will
you
not
do
penance
at
last
for
your
madness
lord
ogrin
said
tristan
hear
us
help
us
to
offer
peace
to
the
king
and
i
will
yield
him
the
queen
and
will
myself
go
far
away
into
brittany
or
the
lowlands
and
if
some
day
the
king
suffer
me
i
will
return
and
serve
as
i
and
at
the
hermit
s
feet
iseult
said
in
her
turn
nor
will
i
live
longer
so
for
though
i
will
not
say
one
word
of
penance
for
my
love
which
is
there
and
remains
forever
yet
from
now
on
i
will
be
separate
from
then
the
hermit
wept
and
praised
god
and
cried
high
king
i
praise
thy
name
for
that
thou
hast
let
me
live
so
long
as
to
give
aid
to
these
and
he
gave
them
wise
counsel
and
took
ink
and
wrote
a
little
writ
offering
the
king
what
tristan
said
that
night
tristan
took
the
road
once
more
he
saw
the
marble
well
and
the
tall
and
he
came
beneath
the
window
where
the
king
slept
and
called
him
gently
and
mark
awoke
and
whispered
who
are
you
that
call
me
in
the
night
at
such
an
hour
lord
i
am
tristan
i
bring
you
a
writ
and
lay
it
then
the
king
cried
nephew
nephew
for
god
s
sake
wait
awhile
but
tristan
had
fled
and
joined
his
squire
and
mounted
rapidly
gorvenal
said
to
him
o
tristan
you
are
mad
to
have
come
fly
hard
with
me
by
the
nearest
so
they
came
back
to
the
hermitage
and
there
they
found
ogrin
at
prayer
but
iseult
weeping
silently
the
ford
mark
had
awakened
his
chaplain
and
had
given
him
the
writ
to
read
the
chaplain
broke
the
seal
saluted
in
tristan
s
name
and
then
when
he
had
cunningly
made
out
the
written
words
told
him
what
tristan
offered
and
mark
heard
without
saying
a
word
but
his
heart
was
glad
for
he
still
loved
the
queen
he
summoned
by
name
the
choicest
of
his
baronage
and
when
they
were
all
assembled
they
were
silent
and
the
king
spoke
my
lords
here
is
a
writ
just
sent
me
i
am
your
king
and
you
my
lieges
hear
what
is
offered
me
and
then
counsel
me
for
you
owe
me
the
chaplain
rose
unfolded
the
writ
and
said
upstanding
my
lords
it
is
tristan
that
first
sends
love
and
homage
to
the
king
and
all
his
barony
and
he
adds
o
king
when
i
slew
the
dragon
and
conquered
the
king
of
ireland
s
daughter
it
was
to
me
they
gave
her
i
was
to
ward
her
at
will
and
i
yielded
her
to
you
yet
hardly
had
you
wed
her
when
felons
made
you
accept
their
lies
and
in
your
anger
fair
uncle
my
lord
you
would
have
had
us
burnt
without
trial
but
god
took
compassion
on
us
we
prayed
him
and
he
saved
the
queen
as
justice
was
and
me
i
leapt
from
a
high
rock
i
was
saved
by
the
power
of
god
and
since
then
what
have
i
done
blameworthy
the
queen
was
thrown
to
the
lepers
i
came
to
her
succour
and
bore
her
away
could
i
have
done
less
for
a
woman
who
all
but
died
innocent
through
me
i
fled
through
the
woods
nor
could
i
have
come
down
into
the
vale
and
yielded
her
for
there
was
a
ban
to
take
us
dead
or
alive
but
now
as
then
i
am
ready
my
lord
to
sustain
in
arms
against
all
comers
that
never
had
the
queen
for
me
nor
i
for
her
a
love
dishonourable
to
you
publish
the
lists
and
if
i
can
not
prove
my
right
in
arms
burn
me
before
your
men
but
if
i
conquer
and
you
take
back
iseult
no
baron
of
yours
will
serve
you
as
will
i
and
if
you
will
not
have
me
i
will
offer
myself
to
the
king
of
galloway
or
to
him
of
the
lowlands
and
you
will
hear
of
me
never
again
take
counsel
king
for
if
you
will
make
no
terms
i
will
take
back
iseult
to
ireland
and
she
shall
be
queen
in
her
own
when
the
barons
of
cornwall
heard
how
tristan
offered
battle
they
said
to
the
king
sire
take
back
the
queen
they
were
madmen
that
belied
her
to
you
but
as
for
tristan
let
him
go
and
war
it
in
galloway
or
in
the
lowlands
bid
him
bring
back
iseult
on
such
a
day
and
that
soon
then
the
king
called
thrice
clearly
will
any
man
rise
in
accusation
against
tristan
and
as
none
replied
he
said
to
his
chaplain
write
me
a
writ
in
haste
you
have
heard
what
you
shall
write
iseult
has
suffered
enough
in
her
youth
and
let
the
writ
be
hung
upon
the
arm
of
the
red
cross
before
evening
write
towards
midnight
tristan
crossed
the
heath
of
sand
and
found
the
writ
and
bore
it
sealed
to
ogrin
and
the
hermit
read
the
letter
how
mark
consented
by
the
counsel
of
his
barons
to
take
back
iseult
but
not
to
keep
tristan
for
his
liege
rather
let
him
cross
the
sea
when
on
the
third
day
hence
at
the
ford
of
chances
he
had
given
back
the
queen
into
king
mark
s
then
tristan
said
to
the
queen
o
my
god
i
must
lose
you
friend
but
it
must
be
since
i
can
thus
spare
you
what
you
suffer
for
my
sake
but
when
we
part
for
ever
i
will
give
you
a
pledge
of
mine
to
keep
and
from
whatever
unknown
land
i
reach
i
will
send
some
messenger
and
he
will
bring
back
word
of
you
and
at
your
call
i
will
come
from
far
iseult
said
sighing
tristan
leave
me
your
dog
toothold
and
every
time
i
see
him
i
will
remember
you
and
will
be
less
sad
and
friend
i
have
here
a
ring
of
green
jasper
take
it
for
the
love
of
me
and
put
it
on
your
finger
then
if
anyone
come
saying
he
is
from
you
i
will
not
trust
him
at
all
till

ring
but
once
i
have
seen

or

prevent
me
from
doing
what
you
or
friend
he
said
here

i
you
friend
she
replied

this
ring
in
and
they
kissed
each
other
on
the
lips
now
ogrin
having
left
the
lovers
in
the
hermitage
hobbled
upon
his
crutch
to
the
place
called
the
mount
and
he
bought
ermine
there
and
fur
and
cloth
of
silk
and
purple
and
scarlet
and
a
palfrey
harnessed
in
gold
that
went
softly
and
the
folk
laughed
to
see
him
spending
upon
these
the
small
moneys
he
had
amassed
so
long
but
the
old
man
put
the
rich
stuffs
upon
the
palfrey
and
came
back
to
iseult
and
queen
said
he
take
these
gifts
of
mine
that
you
may
seem
the
finer
on
the
day
when
you
come
to
the
meanwhile
the
king
had
had
cried
through
cornwall
the
news
that
on
the
third
day
he
would
make
his
peace
with
the
queen
at
the
ford
and
knights
and
ladies
came
in
a
crowd
to
the
gathering
for
all
loved
the
queen
and
would
see
her
save
the
three
felons
that
yet
survived
on
the
day
chosen
for
the
meeting
the
field
shone
far
with
the
rich
tents
of
the
barons
and
suddenly
tristan
and
iseult
came
out
at
the
forest
s
edge
and
caught
sight
of
king
mark
far
off
among
his
barony
friend
said
tristan
there
is
the
king
your
knights
and
his
men
they
are
coming
towards
us
and
very
soon
we
may
not
speak
to
each
other
again
by
the
god
of
power
i
conjure
you
if
ever
i
send
you
a
word
do
you
my
friend
said
iseult
on
the
day
that
i
see
the
ring
nor
tower
nor
wall
nor
stronghold
will
let
me
from
doing
the
will
of
my
why
then
he
said
iseult
may
god
reward
their
horses
went
abreast
and
he
drew
her
towards
him
with
his
arm
friend
said
iseult
hear
my
last
prayer
you
will
leave
this
land
but
wait
some
days
hide
till
you
know
how
the
king
may
treat
me
whether
in
wrath
or
kindness
for
i
am
afraid
friend
orri
the
woodman
will
entertain
you
hidden
go
you
by
night
to
the
abandoned
cellar
that
you
know
and
i
will
send
perinis
there
to
say
if
anyone
misuse
friend
none
would
dare
i
will
stay
hidden
with
orri
and
if
any
misuse
you
let
him
fear
me
as
the
enemy
now
the
two
troops
were
near
and
they
saluted
and
the
king
rode
a
before
his
men
and
with
him
dinas
of
lidan
and
when
the
barons
had
come
up
tristan
holding
iseult
s
palfrey
by
the
bridle
bowed
to
the
king
and
said
o
king
i
yield
you
here
iseult
the
fair
and
i
summon
you
before
the
men
of
your
land
that
i
may
defend
myself
in
your
court
for
i
have
had
no
judgment
let
me
have
trial
at
arms
and
if
i
am
conquered
burn
me
but
if
i
conquer
keep
me
by
you
or
if
you
will
not
i
will
be
off
to
some
far
but
no
one
took
up
tristan
s
wager
and
the
king
taking
iseult
s
palfrey
by
the
bridle
gave
it
to
dinas
and
went
apart
to
take
counsel
dinas
in
his
joy
gave
all
honour
and
courtesy
to
the
queen
but
when
the
felons
saw
her
so
fair
and
honoured
as
of
old
they
were
stirred
and
rode
to
the
king
and
said
king
hear
our
counsel
that
the
queen
was
slandered
we
admit
but
if
she
and
tristan
your
court
together
rumour
will
revive
again
rather
let
tristan
go
apart
awhile
doubtless
some
day
you
may
recall
and
so
mark
did
and
ordered
tristan
by
his
barons
to
go
off
without
delay
then
tristan
came
near
the
queen
for
his
farewell
and
as
they
looked
at
one
another
the
queen
in
shame
of
that
assembly
blushed
but
the
king
pitied
her
and
spoke
his
nephew
thus
for
the
first
time
you
can
not
leave
in
these
rags
take
then
from
my
treasury
gold
and
silver
and
white
fur
and
grey
as
much
as
you
king
said
tristan
neither
a
penny
nor
a
link
of
mail
i
will
go
as
i
can
and
serve
with
high
heart
the
mighty
king
in
the
and
he
turned
rein
and
went
down
towards
the
sea
but
iseult
followed
him
with
her
eyes
and
so
long
as
he
could
yet
be
seen
a
long
way
off
she
did
not
turn
now
at
the
news
of
the
peace
men
women
and
children
great
and
small
ran
out
of
the
town
in
a
crowd
to
meet
iseult
and
while
they
mourned
tristan
s
exile
they
rejoiced
at
the
queen
s
return
and
to
the
noise
of
bells
and
over
pavings
strewn
with
branches
the
king
and
his
counts
and
princes
made
her
escort
and
the
gates
of
the
palace
were
thrown
open
that
rich
and
poor
might
enter
and
eat
and
drink
at
will
and
mark
freed
a
hundred
of
his
slaves
and
armed
a
score
of
squires
that
day
with
hauberk
and
with
sword
but
tristan
that
night
hid
with
orri
as
the
queen
had
counselled
him
the
ordeal
by
iron
denoalen
andret
and
gondoin
held
themselves
safe
tristan
was
far
over
sea
far
away
in
service
of
a
distant
king
and
they
beyond
his
power
therefore
during
a
hunt
one
day
as
the
king
rode
apart
in
a
glade
where
the
pack
would
pass
and
hearkening
to
the
hounds
they
all
three
rode
towards
him
and
said
o
king
we
have
somewhat
to
say
once
you
condemned
the
queen
without
judgment
and
that
was
wrong
now
you
acquit
her
without
judgment
and
that
is
wrong
she
is
not
quit
by
trial
and
the
barons
of
your
land
blame
you
both
counsel
her
then
to
claim
the
ordeal
in
god
s
judgment
for
since
she
is
innocent
she
may
swear
on
the
relics
of
the
saints
and
hot
iron
will
not
hurt
her
for
so
custom
runs
and
in
this
easy
way
are
doubts
but
mark
answered
god
strike
you
my
cornish
lords
how
you
hunt
my
shame
for
you
have
i
exiled
my
nephew
and
now
what
would
you
now
would
you
have
me
drive
the
queen
to
ireland
too
what
novel
plaints
have
you
to
plead
did
not
tristan
offer
you
battle
in
this
matter
he
offered
battle
to
clear
the
queen
forever
he
offered
and
you
heard
him
all
where
then
were
your
lances
and
your
shields
sire
they
said
we
have
counselled
you
loyal
counsel
as
lieges
and
to
your
honour
henceforward
we
hold
our
peace
put
aside
your
anger
and
give
us
your
but
mark
stood
up
in
the
stirrup
and
cried
out
of
my
land
and
out
of
my
peace
all
of
you
tristan
i
exiled
for
you
and
now
go
you
in
turn
out
of
my
land
but
they
answered
sire
it
is
well
our
keeps
are
strong
and
fenced
and
stand
on
rocks
not
easy
for
men
to
and
they
rode
off
without
a
salutation
but
the
king
not
tarrying
for
huntsman
or
for
hound
but
straight
away
spurred
his
horse
to
tintagel
and
as
he
sprang
up
the
stairs
the
queen
heard
the
jangle
of
his
spurs
upon
the
stones
she
rose
to
meet
him
and
took
his
sword
as
she
was
wont
and
bowed
before
him
as
it
was
also
her
wont
to
do
but
mark
raised
her
holding
her
hands
and
when
iseult
looked
up
she
saw
his
noble
face
in
just
that
wrath
she
had
seen
before
the
faggot
fire
she
thought
that
tristan
was
found
and
her
heart
grew
cold
and
without
a
word
she
fell
at
the
king
s
feet
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
gently
till
she
could
speak
again
and
then
he
said
friend
friend
what
evil
tries
you
sire
i
am
afraid
for
i
have
seen
your
anger
yes
i
was
angered
at
the
my
lord
should
one
take
so
deeply
the
mischances
of
a
game
mark
smiled
and
said
no
friend
no
chance
of
hunting
vexed
me
but
those
three
felons
whom
you
know
and
i
have
driven
them
forth
from
my
sire
what
did
they
say
or
dare
to
say
of
me
what
matter
i
have
driven
them
sire
all
living
have
this
right
to
say
the
word
they
have
conceived
and
i
would
ask
a
question
but
from
whom
shall
i
learn
save
from
you
i
am
alone
in
a
foreign
land
and
have
no
one
else
to
defend
they
would
have
it
that
you
should
quit
yourself
by
solemn
oath
and
by
the
ordeal
of
iron
saying
that
god
was
a
true
judge
and
that
as
the
queen
was
innocent
she
herself
should
seek
such
judgment
as
would
clear
her
for
this
was
their
clamour
and
their
demand
incessantly
but
let
us
leave
it
i
tell
you
i
have
driven
them
iseult
trembled
but
looking
straight
at
the
king
she
said
sire
call
them
back
i
will
clear
myself
by
oath
but
i
bargain
this
that
on
the
appointed
day
you
call
king
arthur
and
lord
gawain
girflet
kay
the
seneschal
and
a
hundred
of
his
knights
to
ride
to
the
sandy
heath
where
your
land
marches
with
his
and
a
river
flows
between
for
i
will
not
swear
before
your
barons
alone
lest
they
should
demand
some
new
thing
and
lest
there
should
be
no
end
to
my
trials
but
if
my
warrantors
king
arthur
and
his
knights
be
there
the
barons
will
not
dare
dispute
the
but
as
the
heralds
rode
to
carduel
iseult
sent
to
tristan
secretly
her
squire
perinis
and
he
ran
through
the
underwood
avoiding
paths
till
he
found
the
hut
of
orri
the
woodman
where
tristan
for
many
days
had
awaited
news
perinis
told
him
all
the
ordeal
the
place
and
the
time
and
added
my
lord
the
queen
would
have
you
on
that
day
and
place
come
dressed
as
a
pilgrim
so
that
none
may
know
so
that
none
may
challenge
the
sandy
heath
she
must
cross
the
river
to
the
place
appointed
beyond
it
where
arthur
and
his
hundred
knights
will
stand
be
you
also
for
my
lady
fears
the
judgment
but
she
trusts
in
then
tristan
answered
go
back
friend
perinis
return
you
to
the
queen
and
say
that
i
will
do
her
and
you
must
know
that
as
perinis
went
back
to
tintagel
he
caught
sight
of
that
same
woodman
who
had
betrayed
the
lovers
before
and
the
woodman
as
he
found
him
had
just
dug
a
pitfall
for
wolves
and
for
wild
boars
and
covered
it
with
leafy
branches
to
hide
it
and
as
perinis
came
near
the
woodman
fled
but
perinis
drove
him
and
caught
him
and
broke
his
staff
and
his
head
together
and
pushed
his
body
into
the
pitfall
with
his
feet
on
the
appointed
day
king
mark
and
iseult
and
the
barons
of
cornwall
stood
by
the
river
and
the
knights
of
arthur
and
all
their
host
were
arrayed
beyond
and
just
before
them
sitting
on
the
shore
was
a
poor
pilgrim
wrapped
in
cloak
and
hood
who
held
his
wooden
platter
and
begged
alms
now
as
the
cornish
boats
came
to
the
shoal
of
the
further
bank
iseult
said
to
the
knights
my
lords
how
shall
i
land
without
befouling
my
clothes
in
the
fetch
me
a
and
one
of
the
knights
hailed
the
pilgrim
and
said
friend
truss
your
coat
and
try
the
water
carry
you
the
queen
to
shore
unless
you
fear
the
but
as
he
took
the
queen
in
his
arms
she
whispered
to
him
and
then
she
whispered
to
him
lower
still
stumble
you
upon
the
and
as
he
touched
shore
he
stumbled
holding
the
queen
in
his
arms
and
the
squires
and
boatmen
with
their
oars
and
drove
the
poor
pilgrim
away
but
the
queen
said
let
him
be
some
great
travail
and
journey
has
weakened
and
she
threw
to
the
pilgrim
a
little
clasp
of
gold
before
the
tent
of
king
arthur
was
spread
a
rich
nicean
cloth
upon
the
grass
and
the
holy
relics
were
set
on
it
taken
out
of
their
covers
and
their
shrines
and
round
the
holy
relics
on
the
sward
stood
a
guard
more
than
a
king
s
guard
for
lord
gawain
girflet
and
kay
the
seneschal
kept
ward
over
them
the
queen
having
prayed
god
took
off
the
jewels
from
her
neck
and
hands
and
gave
them
to
the
beggars
around
she
took
off
her
purple
mantle
and
her
overdress
and
her
shoes
with
their
precious
stones
and
gave
them
also
to
the
poor
that
loved
her
she
kept
upon
her
only
the
sleeveless
tunic
and
then
with
arms
and
feet
quite
bare
she
came
between
the
two
kings
and
all
around
the
barons
watched
her
in
silence
and
some
wept
for
near
the
holy
relics
was
a
brazier
burning
and
trembling
a
little
she
stretched
her
right
hand
towards
the
bones
and
said
kings
of
logres
and
of
cornwall
my
lords
gawain
and
kay
and
girflet
and
all
of
you
that
are
my
warrantors
by
these
holy
things
and
all
the
holy
things
of
earth
i
swear
that
no
man
has
held
me
in
his
arms
saving
king
mark
my
lord
and
that
poor
pilgrim
king
mark
will
that
oath
stand
yes
queen
he
said
and
god
see
to
it
amen
said
iseult
and
then
she
went
near
the
brazier
pale
and
stumbling
and
all
were
silent
the
iron
was
red
but
she
thrust
her
bare
arms
among
the
coals
and
seized
it
and
bearing
it
took
nine
steps
then
as
she
cast
it
from
her
she
stretched
her
arms
out
in
a
cross
with
the
palms
of
her
hands
wide
open
and
all
men
saw
them
fresh
and
clean
and
cold
seeing
that
great
sight
the
kings
and
the
barons
and
the
people
stood
for
a
moment
silent
then
they
stirred
together
and
they
praised
god
loudly
all
around
part
the
third
the
little
fairy
bell
when
tristan
had
come
back
to
orri
s
hut
and
had
loosened
his
heavy
pilgrim
s
cape
he
saw
clearly
in
his
heart
that
it
was
time
to
keep
his
oath
to
king
mark
and
to
fly
the
land
three
days
yet
he
tarried
because
he
could
not
drag
himself
away
from
that
earth
but
on
the
fourth
day
he
thanked
the
woodman
and
said
to
gorvenal
master
the
hour
is
and
he
went
into
wales
into
the
land
of
the
great
duke
gilain
who
was
young
powerful
and
frank
in
spirit
and
welcomed
him
nobly
as
a
guest
and
he
did
everything
to
give
him
honour
and
joy
but
he
found
that
neither
adventure
nor
feast
could
soothe
what
tristan
suffered
one
day
as
he
sat
by
the
young
duke
s
side
his
spirit
weighed
upon
him
so
that
not
knowing
it
he
groaned
and
the
duke
to
soothe
him
ordered
into
his
private
room
a
fairy
thing
which
pleased
his
eyes
when
he
was
sad
and
relieved
his
own
heart
it
was
a
dog
and
the
varlets
brought
it
in
to
him
and
they
put
it
upon
a
table
there
now
this
dog
was
a
fairy
dog
and
came
from
the
duke
of
avalon
for
a
fairy
had
given
it
him
as
a
and
no
one
can
well
describe
its
kind
or
beauty
and
it
bore
at
its
neck
hung
to
a
little
chain
of
gold
a
little
bell
and
that
tinkled
so
gaily
and
so
clear
and
so
soft
that
as
tristan
heard
it
he
was
soothed
and
his
anguish
melted
away
and
he
forgot
all
that
he
had
suffered
for
the
queen
for
such
was
the
virtue
of
the
bell
and
such
its
property
that
whosoever
heard
it
he
lost
all
pain
and
as
tristan
stroked
the
little
fairy
thing
the
dog
that
took
away
his
sorrow
he
saw
how
delicate
it
was
and
fine
and
how
it
had
soft
hair
like
samite
and
he
thought
how
good
a
gift
it
would
make
for
the
queen
but
he
dared
not
ask
for
it
right
out
since
he
knew
that
the
duke
loved
this
dog
beyond
everything
in
the
world
and
would
yield
it
to
no
prayers
nor
to
wealth
nor
to
wile
so
one
day
tristan
having
made
a
plan
in
his
mind
said
this
lord
what
would
you
give
to
the
man
who
could
rid
your
land
of
the
hairy
giant
urgan
that
levies
such
a
toll
truly
the
victor
might
choose
what
he
would
but
none
will
then
said
tristan
those
are
strange
words
for
good
comes
to
no
land
save
by
risk
and
daring
and
not
for
all
the
gold
of
milan
would
i
renounce
my
desire
to
find
him
in
his
wood
and
bring
him
then
tristan
went
out
to
find
urgan
in
his
lair
and
they
fought
hard
and
long
till
courage
conquered
strength
and
tristan
having
cut
off
the
giant
s
hand
bore
it
back
to
the
duke
and
sire
said
he
since
i
may
choose
a
reward
according
to
your
word
give
me
the
little
fairy
dog
it
was
for
that
i
conquered
urgan
and
your
promise
friend
said
the
duke
take
it
then
but
in
taking
it
you
take
away
also
all
my
then
tristan
took
the
little
fairy
dog
and
gave
it
in
ward
to
a
welsh
harper
who
was
cunning
and
who
bore
it
to
cornwall
till
he
came
to
tintagel
and
having
come
there
put
it
secretly
into
brangien
s
hands
and
the
queen
was
so
pleased
that
she
gave
ten
marks
of
gold
to
the
harper
but
she
put
it
about
that
the
queen
of
ireland
her
mother
had
sent
the
beast
and
she
had
a
goldsmith
work
a
little
kennel
for
him
all
jewelled
and
incrusted
with
gold
and
enamel
inlaid
and
wherever
she
went
she
carried
the
dog
with
her
in
memory
of
her
friend
and
as
she
watched
it
sadness
and
anguish
and
regrets
melted
out
of
her
heart
at
first
she
did
not
guess
the
marvel
but
thought
her
consolation
was
because
the
gift
was
tristan
s
till
one
day
she
found
that
it
was
fairy
and
that
it
was
the
little
bell
that
charmed
her
soul
then
she
thought
what
have
i
to
do
with
comfort
since
he
is
sorrowing
he
could
have
kept
it
too
and
have
forgotten
his
sorrow
but
with
high
courtesy
he
sent
it
to
me
to
give
me
his
joy
and
to
take
up
his
pain
again
friend
while
you
suffer
so
long
will
i
suffer
and
she
took
the
magic
bell
and
shook
it
just
a
little
and
then
by
the
open
window
she
threw
it
into
the
sea
iseult
of
the
white
hands
apart
the
lovers
could
neither
live
nor
die
for
it
was
life
and
death
together
and
tristan
fled
his
sorrow
through
seas
and
islands
and
many
lands
he
fled
his
sorrow
still
by
seas
and
islands
till
at
last
he
came
back
to
his
land
of
lyonesse
and
there
rohalt
the
keeper
of
faith
welcomed
him
with
happy
tears
and
called
him
son
but
he
could
not
live
in
the
peace
of
his
own
land
and
he
turned
again
and
rode
through
kingdoms
and
through
baronies
seeking
adventure
from
the
lyonesse
to
the
lowlands
from
the
lowlands
on
to
the
germanies
through
the
germanies
and
into
spain
and
many
lords
he
served
and
many
deeds
did
but
for
two
years
no
news
came
to
him
out
of
cornwall
nor
friend
nor
messenger
then
he
thought
that
iseult
had
forgotten
now
it
happened
one
day
that
riding
with
gorvenal
alone
he
came
into
the
land
of
brittany
they
rode
through
a
wasted
plain
of
ruined
walls
and
empty
hamlets
and
burnt
fields
everywhere
and
the
earth
deserted
of
men
and
tristan
thought
i
am
weary
and
my
deeds
profit
me
nothing
my
lady
is
far
off
and
i
shall
never
see
her
again
or
why
for
two
years
has
she
made
no
sign
or
why
has
she
sent
no
messenger
to
find
me
as
i
wandered
but
in
tintagel
mark
honours
her
and
she
gives
him
joy
and
that
little
fairy
bell
has
done
a
thorough
work
for
little
she
remembers
or
cares
for
the
joys
and
the
mourning
of
old
little
for
me
as
i
wander
in
this
desert
place
i
too
will
on
the
third
day
at
the
hour
of
noon
tristan
and
gorvenal
came
near
a
hill
where
an
old
chantry
stood
and
close
by
a
hermitage
also
and
tristan
asked
what
wasted
land
that
was
and
the
hermit
answered
lord
it
is
breton
land
which
duke
hod
holds
and
once
it
was
rich
in
pasture
and
ploughland
but
count
riol
of
nantes
has
wasted
it
for
you
must
know
that
this
count
riol
was
the
duke
s
vassal
and
the
duke
has
a
daughter
fair
among
all
king
s
daughters
and
count
riol
would
have
taken
her
to
wife
but
her
father
refused
her
to
a
vassal
and
count
riol
would
have
carried
her
away
by
force
many
men
have
died
in
that
and
tristan
asked
can
the
duke
wage
his
war
and
the
hermit
answered
hardly
my
lord
yet
his
last
keep
of
carhaix
holds
out
still
for
the
walls
are
strong
and
strong
is
the
heart
of
the
duke
s
son
kaherdin
a
very
good
knight
and
bold
but
the
enemy
surrounds
them
on
every
side
and
starves
them
very
hardly
do
they
hold
their
then
tristan
asked
how
far
is
this
keep
of
carhaix
sir
said
the
hermit
it
is
but
two
miles
further
on
this
then
tristan
and
gorvenal
lay
down
for
it
was
evening
in
the
morning
when
they
had
slept
and
when
the
hermit
had
chanted
and
had
shared
his
black
bread
with
them
tristan
thanked
him
and
rode
hard
to
carhaix
and
as
he
halted
beneath
the
fast
high
walls
he
saw
a
little
company
of
men
behind
the
battlements
and
he
asked
if
the
duke
were
there
with
his
son
kaherdin
now
hod
was
among
them
and
when
he
cried
yes
tristan
called
up
to
him
and
said
i
am
that
tristan
king
of
lyonesse
and
mark
of
cornwall
is
my
uncle
i
have
heard
that
your
vassals
do
you
a
wrong
and
i
have
come
to
offer
you
my
arms
alas
lord
tristan
go
you
your
way
alone
and
god
reward
you
for
here
within
we
have
no
more
food
no
wheat
or
meat
or
any
stores
but
only
lentils
and
a
little
oats
but
tristan
said
for
two
years
i
dwelt
in
a
forest
eating
nothing
save
roots
and
herbs
yet
i
found
it
a
good
life
so
open
you
the
they
welcomed
him
with
honour
and
kaherdin
showed
him
the
wall
and
the
dungeon
keep
with
all
their
devices
and
from
the
battlements
he
showed
the
plain
where
far
away
gleamed
the
tents
of
duke
riol
and
when
they
were
down
in
the
castle
again
he
said
to
tristan
friend
let
us
go
to
the
hall
where
my
mother
and
sister
so
holding
each
other
s
hands
they
came
into
the
women
s
room
where
the
mother
and
the
daughter
sat
together
weaving
gold
upon
english
cloth
and
singing
a
weaving
song
they
sang
of
doette
the
fair
who
sits
alone
beneath
the
and
round
about
her
blows
the
wind
she
waits
for
doon
her
friend
but
he
tarries
long
and
does
not
come
this
was
the
song
they
sang
and
tristan
bowed
to
them
and
they
to
him
then
kaherdin
showing
the
work
his
mother
did
said
see
friend
tristan
what
a
is
here
and
how
marvellously
she
adorns
stoles
and
chasubles
for
the
poor
minsters
and
how
my
sister
s
hands
run
thread
of
gold
upon
this
cloth
of
right
good
sister
are
you
called
iseult
of
the
white
but
tristan
hearing
her
name
smiled
and
looked
at
her
more
gently
and
on
the
morrow
tristan
kaherdin
and
twelve
young
knights
left
the
castle
and
rode
to
a
pinewood
near
the
enemy
s
tents
and
sprang
from
ambush
and
captured
a
waggon
of
count
riol
s
food
and
from
that
day
by
escapade
and
ruse
they
would
carry
tents
and
convoys
and
kill
off
men
nor
ever
come
back
without
some
booty
so
that
tristan
and
kaherdin
began
to
be
brothers
in
arms
and
kept
faith
and
tenderness
as
history
tells
and
as
they
came
back
from
these
rides
talking
chivalry
together
often
did
kaherdin
praise
to
his
comrade
his
sister
iseult
of
the
white
hands
for
her
simplicity
and
beauty
one
day
as
the
dawn
broke
a
sentinel
ran
from
the
tower
through
the
halls
crying
lords
you
have
slept
too
long
rise
for
an
assault
is
and
knights
and
burgesses
armed
and
ran
to
the
walls
and
saw
helmets
shining
on
the
plain
and
pennons
streaming
crimson
like
flames
and
all
the
host
of
riol
in
its
array
then
the
duke
and
kaherdin
deployed
their
horsemen
before
the
gates
and
from
a
off
they
stooped
and
spurred
and
charged
and
they
put
their
lances
down
together
and
the
arrows
fell
on
them
like
april
rain
now
tristan
had
armed
himself
among
the
last
of
those
the
sentinel
had
roused
and
he
laced
his
shoes
of
steel
and
put
on
his
mail
and
his
spurs
of
gold
his
hauberk
and
his
helm
over
the
gorget
and
he
mounted
and
spurred
with
shield
on
breast
crying
carhaix
and
as
he
came
he
saw
duke
riol
charging
rein
free
at
kaherdin
but
tristan
came
in
between
so
they
met
tristan
and
duke
riol
and
at
the
shock
tristan
s
lance
shivered
but
riol
s
lance
struck
tristan
s
horse
just
where
the
runs
and
laid
it
on
the
field
but
tristan
standing
drew
his
sword
his
burnished
sword
and
said
coward
here
is
death
ready
for
the
man
that
strikes
the
horse
before
the
but
riol
answered
i
think
you
have
lied
my
lord
and
he
charged
him
and
as
he
passed
tristan
let
fall
his
sword
so
heavily
upon
his
helm
that
he
carried
away
the
crest
and
the
nasal
but
the
sword
slipped
on
the
mailed
shoulder
and
glanced
on
the
horse
and
killed
it
so
that
of
force
duke
riol
must
slip
the
stirrup
and
leap
and
feel
the
ground
then
riol
too
was
on
his
feet
and
they
both
fought
hard
in
their
broken
mail
their
scutcheons
torn
and
their
helmets
loosened
and
lashing
with
their
dented
swords
till
tristan
struck
riol
just
where
the
helmet
buckles
and
it
yielded
and
the
blow
was
struck
so
hard
that
the
baron
fell
on
hands
and
knees
but
when
he
had
risen
again
tristan
struck
him
down
once
more
with
a
blow
that
split
the
helm
and
it
split
the
headpiece
too
and
touched
the
skull
then
riol
cried
mercy
and
begged
his
life
and
tristan
took
his
sword
so
he
promised
to
enter
duke
hoël
s
keep
and
to
swear
homage
again
and
to
restore
what
he
had
wasted
and
by
his
order
the
battle
ceased
and
his
host
went
off
discomfited
now
when
the
victors
were
returned
kaherdin
said
to
his
father
sire
keep
you
tristan
there
is
no
better
knight
and
your
land
has
need
of
such
so
when
the
duke
had
taken
counsel
with
his
barons
he
said
to
tristan
friend
i
owe
you
my
land
but
i
shall
be
quit
with
you
if
you
will
take
my
daughter
iseult
of
the
white
hands
who
comes
of
kings
and
of
queens
and
of
dukes
before
them
in
and
tristan
answered
i
will
take
her
so
the
day
was
fixed
and
the
duke
came
with
his
friends
and
tristan
with
his
and
before
all
at
the
gate
of
the
minster
tristan
wed
iseult
of
the
white
hands
according
to
the
church
s
law
but
that
same
night
as
tristan
s
valets
undressed
him
it
happened
that
in
drawing
his
arm
from
the
sleeve
they
drew
off
and
let
fall
from
his
finger
the
ring
of
green
jasper
the
ring
of
iseult
the
fair
it
sounded
on
the
stones
and
tristan
looked
and
saw
it
then
his
heart
awoke
and
he
knew
that
he
had
done
wrong
for
he
remembered
the
day
when
iseult
the
fair
had
given
him
the
ring
it
was
in
that
forest
where
for
his
sake
she
had
led
the
hard
life
with
him
and
that
night
he
saw
again
the
hut
in
the
wood
of
morois
and
he
was
bitter
with
himself
that
ever
he
had
accused
her
of
treason
for
now
it
was
he
that
had
betrayed
and
he
was
bitter
with
himself
also
in
pity
for
this
new
wife
and
her
simplicity
and
beauty
see
how
these
two
iseults
had
met
him
in
an
evil
hour
and
to
both
had
he
broken
faith
now
iseult
of
the
white
hands
said
to
him
hearing
him
sigh
dear
lord
have
i
hurt
you
in
anything
will
you
not
speak
me
a
single
word
but
tristan
answered
friend
do
not
be
angry
with
me
for
once
in
another
land
i
fought
a
foul
dragon
and
was
near
to
death
and
i
thought
of
the
mother
of
god
and
i
made
a
vow
to
her
that
should
i
ever
wed
i
would
spend
the
first
holy
nights
of
my
wedding
in
prayer
and
in
why
said
iseult
that
was
a
good
and
tristan
watched
through
the
night
the
madness
of
tristan
within
her
room
at
tintagel
iseult
the
fair
sighed
for
the
sake
of
tristan
and
named
him
her
desire
of
whom
for
two
years
she
had
had
no
word
whether
he
lived
or
no
within
her
room
at
tintagel
iseult
the
fair
sat
singing
a
song
she
had
made
she
sang
of
guron
taken
and
killed
for
his
love
and
how
by
guile
the
count
gave
guron
s
heart
to
her
to
eat
and
of
her
woe
the
queen
sang
softly
catching
the
harp
s
tone
her
hands
were
cunning
and
her
song
good
she
sang
low
down
and
softly
then
came
in
kariado
a
rich
count
from
a
island
that
had
fared
to
tintagel
to
offer
the
queen
his
service
and
had
spoken
of
love
to
her
though
she
disdained
his
folly
he
found
iseult
as
she
sang
and
laughed
to
her
lady
how
sad
a
song
as
sad
as
the
osprey
s
do
they
not
say
he
sings
for
death
and
your
song
means
that
to
me
i
die
for
and
iseult
said
so
let
it
be
and
may
it
mean
so
for
never
come
you
here
but
to
stir
in
me
anger
or
mourning
ever
were
you
the
screech
owl
or
the
osprey
that
boded
ill
when
you
spoke
of
tristan
what
news
bear
you
now
and
kariado
answered
you
are
angered
i
know
not
why
but
who
heeds
your
words
let
the
osprey
bode
me
death
here
is
the
evil
news
the
screech
owl
brings
lady
iseult
tristan
your
friend
is
lost
to
you
he
has
wed
in
a
far
land
so
seek
you
other
where
for
he
mocks
your
love
he
has
wed
in
great
pomp
iseult
of
the
white
hands
the
king
of
brittany
s
and
kariado
went
off
in
anger
but
iseult
bowed
her
head
and
broke
into
tears
now
far
from
iseult
tristan
languished
till
on
a
day
he
must
needs
see
her
again
far
from
her
death
came
surely
and
he
had
rather
die
at
once
than
day
by
day
and
he
desired
some
death
but
that
the
queen
might
know
it
was
in
finding
her
then
would
death
come
easily
so
he
left
carhaix
secretly
telling
no
man
neither
his
kindred
nor
even
kaherdin
his
brother
in
arms
he
went
in
rags
afoot
for
no
one
marks
the
beggar
on
the
high
road
till
he
came
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
he
found
in
a
haven
a
great
ship
ready
the
sail
was
up
and
the
short
at
the
bow
god
save
you
my
lords
he
said
and
send
you
a
good
journey
to
what
land
sail
you
now
to
tintagel
they
said
then
he
cried
out
oh
my
lords
take
me
with
you
thither
and
he
went
aboard
and
a
fair
wind
filled
the
sail
and
she
ran
five
days
and
nights
for
cornwall
till
on
the
sixth
day
they
dropped
anchor
in
tintagel
haven
the
castle
stood
above
fenced
all
around
there
was
but
the
one
armed
gate
and
two
knights
watched
it
night
and
day
so
tristan
went
ashore
and
sat
upon
the
beach
and
a
man
told
him
that
mark
was
there
and
had
just
held
his
court
but
where
said
he
is
iseult
the
queen
and
her
fair
maid
brangien
in
tintagel
too
said
the
other
and
i
saw
them
lately
the
queen
sad
as
she
always
at
the
hearing
of
the
name
tristan
suffered
and
he
thought
that
neither
by
guile
nor
courage
could
he
see
that
friend
for
mark
would
kill
him
and
he
thought
let
him
kill
me
and
let
me
die
for
her
since
every
day
i
die
but
you
iseult
even
if
you
knew
me
here
would
you
not
drive
me
out
and
he
thought
i
will
try
guile
i
will
seem
mad
but
with
a
madness
that
shall
be
great
wisdom
and
many
shall
think
me
a
fool
that
have
less
wit
than
just
then
a
fisherman
passed
in
a
rough
cloak
and
cape
and
tristan
seeing
him
took
him
aside
and
said
friend
will
you
not
change
clothes
and
as
the
fisherman
found
it
a
very
good
bargain
he
said
in
answer
yes
friend
and
he
changed
and
ran
off
at
once
for
fear
of
losing
his
gain
then
tristan
shaved
his
wonderful
hair
he
shaved
it
close
to
his
head
and
left
a
cross
all
bald
and
he
rubbed
his
face
with
magic
herbs
distilled
in
his
own
country
and
it
changed
in
colour
and
skin
so
that
none
could
know
him
and
he
made
him
a
club
from
a
young
tree
torn
from
a
and
hung
it
to
his
neck
and
went
towards
the
castle
the
porter
made
sure
that
he
had
to
do
with
a
fool
and
said
good
morrow
fool
where
have
you
been
this
long
while
and
he
answered
at
the
abbot
of
michael
s
wedding
and
he
wed
an
abbess
large
and
veiled
and
from
the
alps
to
mount
michael
how
they
came
the
priests
and
abbots
monks
and
regulars
all
dancing
on
the
green
with
croziers
and
with
staves
under
the
high
trees
shade
but
i
left
them
all
to
come
hither
for
i
serve
at
the
king
s
board
then
the
porter
said
come
in
lord
fool
the
hairy
urgan
s
son
i
know
and
like
your
and
when
he
was
within
the
courts
the
serving
men
ran
after
him
and
cried
the
fool
the
fool
but
he
made
play
with
them
though
they
cast
stones
and
struck
him
as
they
laughed
and
in
the
midst
of
laughter
and
their
cries
as
the
rout
followed
him
he
came
to
that
hall
where
at
the
queen
s
side
king
mark
sat
under
his
canopy
and
as
he
neared
the
door
with
his
club
at
his
neck
the
king
said
here
is
a
merry
fellow
let
him
and
they
brought
him
in
his
club
at
his
neck
and
the
king
said
friend
well
come
what
seek
you
here
iseult
said
he
whom
i
love
so
well
i
bring
my
sister
with
me
brunehild
the
beautiful
come
take
her
you
are
weary
of
the
queen
take
you
my
sister
and
give
me
here
iseult
and
i
will
hold
her
and
serve
you
for
her
the
king
said
laughing
fool
if
i
gave
you
the
queen
where
would
you
take
her
pray
oh
very
high
he
said
between
the
clouds
and
heaven
into
a
fair
chamber
glazed
the
beams
of
the
sun
shine
through
it
yet
the
winds
do
not
trouble
it
at
all
there
would
i
bear
the
queen
into
that
crystal
chamber
of
mine
all
compact
of
roses
and
the
the
king
and
his
barons
laughed
and
said
here
is
a
good
fool
at
no
loss
for
but
the
fool
as
he
sat
at
their
feet
gazed
at
iseult
most
fixedly
friend
said
king
mark
what
warrant
have
you
that
the
queen
would
heed
so
foul
a
fool
as
you
o
sire
he
answered
gravely
many
deeds
have
i
done
for
her
and
my
madness
is
from
her
what
is
your
name
they
said
and
laughed
tristan
said
he
that
loved
the
queen
so
well
and
still
till
death
will
love
but
at
the
name
the
queen
angered
and
weakened
together
and
said
get
hence
for
an
evil
fool
but
the
fool
marking
her
anger
went
on
queen
iseult
do
you
mind
the
day
when
poisoned
by
the
morholt
s
spear
i
took
my
harp
to
sea
and
fell
upon
your
shore
your
mother
healed
me
with
strange
drugs
have
you
no
memory
queen
but
iseult
answered
out
fool
out
your
folly
and
you
have
passed
the
bounds
but
the
fool
still
playing
pushed
the
barons
out
crying
out
madmen
out
leave
me
to
counsel
with
iseult
since
i
come
here
for
the
love
of
her
and
as
the
king
laughed
iseult
blushed
and
said
king
drive
me
forth
this
fool
but
the
fool
still
laughed
and
cried
queen
do
you
mind
you
of
the
dragon
i
slew
in
your
land
i
hid
its
tongue
in
my
hose
and
burnt
of
its
venom
i
fell
by
the
roadside
ah
what
a
knight
was
i
then
and
it
was
you
that
succoured
iseult
replied
silence
you
wrong
all
knighthood
by
your
words
for
you
are
a
fool
from
birth
cursed
be
the
seamen
that
brought
you
hither
rather
should
they
have
cast
you
into
the
sea
queen
iseult
he
still
said
on
do
you
mind
you
of
your
haste
when
you
would
have
slain
me
with
my
own
sword
and
of
the
hair
of
gold
and
of
how
i
stood
up
to
the
seneschal
silence
she
said
you
drunkard
you
were
drunk
last
night
and
so
you
dreamt
these
drunk
and
still
so
am
i
said
he
but
of
such
a
draught
that
never
can
the
influence
fade
queen
iseult
do
you
mind
you
of
that
hot
and
open
day
on
the
high
seas
we
thirsted
and
we
drank
together
from
the
same
cup
and
since
that
day
have
i
been
drunk
with
an
awful
when
the
queen
heard
these
words
which
she
alone
could
understand
she
rose
and
would
have
gone
but
the
king
held
her
by
her
ermine
cloak
and
she
sat
down
again
and
as
the
king
had
his
fill
of
the
fool
he
called
for
his
falcons
and
went
to
hunt
and
iseult
said
to
him
sire
i
am
weak
and
sad
let
me
be
go
rest
in
my
room
i
am
tired
of
these
and
she
went
to
her
room
in
thought
and
sat
upon
her
bed
and
mourned
calling
herself
a
slave
and
saying
why
was
i
born
brangien
dear
sister
life
is
so
hard
to
me
that
death
were
better
there
is
a
fool
without
shaven
and
come
in
an
evil
hour
and
he
is
warlock
for
he
knows
in
every
part
myself
and
my
whole
life
he
knows
what
you
and
i
and
tristan
only
then
brangien
said
it
may
be
no
said
the
queen
for
he
was
the
first
of
knights
but
this
fool
is
foul
and
made
awry
curse
me
his
hour
and
the
ship
that
brought
him
my
lady
said
brangien
soothe
you
you
curse
over
much
these
days
may
be
he
comes
from
tristan
i
can
not
tell
i
know
him
not
but
go
find
him
friend
and
see
if
you
know
so
brangien
went
to
the
hall
where
the
fool
still
sat
alone
tristan
knew
her
and
let
fall
his
club
and
said
brangien
dear
brangien
before
god
have
pity
on
me
foul
fool
she
answered
what
devil
taught
you
my
name
lady
he
said
i
have
known
it
long
by
my
head
that
once
was
fair
if
i
am
mad
the
blame
is
yours
for
it
was
yours
to
watch
over
the
wine
we
drank
on
the
high
seas
the
cup
was
of
silver
and
i
held
it
to
iseult
and
she
drank
do
you
remember
lady
no
she
said
and
as
she
trembled
and
left
he
called
out
pity
me
he
followed
and
saw
iseult
he
stretched
out
his
arms
but
in
her
shame
sweating
agony
she
drew
back
and
tristan
angered
and
said
i
have
lived
too
long
for
i
have
seen
the
day
that
iseult
will
nothing
of
me
iseult
how
hard
love
dies
iseult
a
welling
water
that
floods
and
runs
large
is
a
mighty
thing
on
the
day
that
it
fails
it
is
nothing
so
love
that
but
she
said
brother
i
look
at
you
and
doubt
and
tremble
and
i
know
you
not
for
queen
iseult
i
am
tristan
indeed
that
do
love
you
mind
you
for
the
last
time
of
the
dwarf
and
of
the
flower
and
of
the
blood
i
shed
in
my
leap
oh
and
of
that
ring
i
took
in
kisses
and
in
tears
on
the
day
we
parted
i
have
kept
that
jasper
ring
and
asked
it
then
iseult
knew
tristan
for
what
he
was
and
she
said
heart
you
should
have
broken
of
sorrow
not
to
have
known
the
man
who
has
suffered
so
much
for
you
pardon
my
master
and
my
and
her
eyes
darkened
and
she
fell
but
when
the
light
returned
she
was
held
by
him
who
kissed
her
eyes
and
her
face
so
passed
they
three
full
days
but
on
the
third
two
maids
that
watched
them
told
the
traitor
andret
and
he
put
spies
before
the
women
s
rooms
and
when
tristan
would
enter
they
cried
back
fool
but
he
brandished
his
club
laughing
and
said
what
may
i
not
kiss
the
queen
who
loves
me
and
awaits
me
now
and
they
feared
him
for
a
mad
fool
and
he
passed
in
through
the
door
then
being
with
the
queen
for
the
last
time
he
held
her
in
his
arms
and
said
friend
i
must
fly
for
they
are
wondering
i
must
fly
and
perhaps
shall
never
see
you
more
my
death
is
near
and
far
from
you
my
death
will
come
of
oh
friend
she
said
fold
your
arms
round
me
close
and
strain
me
so
that
our
hearts
may
break
and
our
souls
go
free
at
last
take
me
to
that
happy
place
of
which
you
told
me
long
ago
the
fields
whence
none
return
but
where
great
singers
sing
their
songs
for
ever
take
me
i
will
take
you
to
the
happy
palace
of
the
living
queen
the
time
is
near
we
have
drunk
all
joy
and
sorrow
the
time
is
near
when
it
is
finished
if
i
call
you
will
you
come
my
friend
friend
said
she
call
me
and
you
know
that
i
shall
friend
said
he
god
send
you
his
as
he
went
out
the
spies
would
have
held
him
but
he
laughed
aloud
and
flourished
his
club
and
cried
peace
gentlemen
i
go
and
will
not
stay
my
lady
sends
me
to
prepare
that
shining
house
i
vowed
her
of
crystal
and
of
rose
shot
through
with
and
as
they
cursed
and
drave
him
the
fool
went
leaping
on
his
way
the
death
of
tristan
when
he
was
come
back
to
brittany
to
carhaix
it
happened
that
tristan
riding
to
the
aid
of
kaherdin
his
brother
in
arms
fell
into
ambush
and
was
wounded
by
a
poisoned
spear
and
many
doctors
came
but
none
could
cure
him
of
the
and
tristan
weakened
and
paled
and
his
bones
showed
then
he
knew
that
his
life
was
going
and
that
he
must
die
and
he
had
a
desire
to
see
once
more
iseult
the
fair
but
he
could
not
seek
her
for
the
sea
would
have
killed
him
in
his
weakness
and
how
could
iseult
come
to
him
and
sad
and
suffering
the
poison
he
awaited
death
he
called
kaherdin
secretly
to
tell
him
his
pain
for
they
loved
each
other
with
a
loyal
love
and
as
he
would
have
no
one
in
the
room
save
kaherdin
nor
even
in
the
neighbouring
rooms
iseult
of
the
white
hands
began
to
wonder
she
was
afraid
and
wished
to
hear
and
she
came
back
and
listened
at
the
wall
by
tristan
s
bed
and
as
she
listened
one
of
her
maids
kept
watch
for
her
now
within
tristan
had
gathered
up
his
strength
and
had
half
risen
leaning
against
the
wall
and
kaherdin
wept
beside
him
they
wept
their
good
comradeship
broken
so
soon
and
their
friendship
then
tristan
told
kaherdin
of
his
love
for
that
other
iseult
and
of
the
sorrow
of
his
life
fair
friend
and
gentle
said
tristan
i
am
in
a
foreign
land
where
i
have
neither
friend
nor
cousin
save
you
and
you
alone
in
this
place
have
given
me
comfort
my
life
is
going
and
i
wish
to
see
once
more
iseult
the
fair
ah
did
i
but
know
of
a
messenger
who
would
go
to
her
for
now
i
know
that
she
will
come
to
me
kaherdin
my
brother
in
arms
i
beg
it
of
your
friendship
try
this
thing
for
me
and
if
you
carry
my
word
i
will
become
your
liege
and
i
will
cherish
you
beyond
all
other
and
as
kaherdin
saw
tristan
broken
down
his
heart
reproached
him
and
he
said
fair
comrade
do
not
weep
i
will
do
what
you
desire
even
if
it
were
risk
of
death
i
would
do
it
for
you
nor
no
distress
nor
anguish
will
let
me
from
doing
it
according
to
my
power
give
me
the
word
you
send
and
i
will
make
and
tristan
answered
thank
you
friend
this
is
my
prayer
take
this
ring
it
is
a
sign
between
her
and
me
and
when
you
come
to
her
land
pass
yourself
at
court
for
a
merchant
and
show
her
silk
and
stuffs
but
make
so
that
she
sees
the
ring
for
then
she
will
find
some
ruse
by
which
to
speak
to
you
in
secret
then
tell
her
that
my
heart
salutes
her
tell
her
that
she
alone
can
bring
me
comfort
tell
her
that
if
she
does
not
come
i
shall
die
tell
her
to
remember
our
past
time
and
our
great
sorrows
and
all
the
joy
there
was
in
our
loyal
and
tender
love
and
tell
her
to
remember
that
draught
we
drank
together
on
the
high
seas
for
we
drank
our
death
together
tell
her
to
remember
the
oath
i
swore
to
serve
a
single
love
for
i
have
kept
that
but
behind
the
wall
iseult
of
the
white
hands
heard
all
these
things
and
tristan
continued
hasten
my
friend
and
come
back
quickly
or
you
will
not
see
me
again
take
forty
days
for
your
term
but
come
back
with
iseult
the
fair
and
tell
your
sister
nothing
or
tell
her
that
you
seek
some
doctor
take
my
fine
ship
and
two
sails
with
you
one
white
one
black
and
as
you
return
if
you
bring
iseult
hoist
the
white
sail
but
if
you
bring
her
not
the
black
now
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
but
god
guide
you
and
bring
you
back
with
the
first
fair
wind
kaherdin
took
the
open
weighed
anchor
and
hoisted
sail
and
ran
with
a
light
air
and
broke
the
seas
they
bore
rich
merchandise
with
them
dyed
silks
of
rare
colours
enamel
of
touraine
and
wines
of
poitou
for
by
this
ruse
kaherdin
thought
to
reach
iseult
eight
days
and
nights
they
ran
full
sail
to
cornwall
now
a
woman
s
wrath
is
a
fearful
thing
and
all
men
fear
it
for
according
to
her
love
so
will
her
vengeance
be
and
their
love
and
their
hate
come
quickly
but
their
hate
lives
longer
than
their
love
and
they
will
make
play
with
love
but
not
with
hate
so
iseult
of
the
white
hands
who
had
heard
every
word
and
who
had
so
loved
tristan
waited
her
vengeance
upon
what
she
loved
most
in
the
world
but
she
hid
it
all
and
when
the
doors
were
open
again
she
came
to
tristan
s
bed
and
served
him
with
food
as
a
lover
should
and
spoke
him
gently
and
kissed
him
on
the
lips
and
asked
him
if
kaherdin
would
soon
return
with
one
to
cure
him
but
all
day
long
she
thought
upon
her
vengeance
and
kaherdin
sailed
and
sailed
till
he
dropped
anchor
in
the
haven
of
tintagel
he
landed
and
took
with
him
a
cloth
of
rare
dye
and
a
cup
well
chiselled
and
worked
and
made
a
present
of
them
to
king
mark
and
courteously
begged
of
him
his
peace
and
safeguard
that
he
might
traffick
in
his
land
and
the
king
gave
him
his
peace
before
all
the
men
of
his
palace
then
kaherdin
offered
the
queen
a
buckle
of
fine
gold
and
queen
said
he
the
gold
is
then
taking
from
his
finger
tristan
s
ring
he
put
it
side
by
side
with
the
jewel
and
said
see
o
queen
the
gold
of
the
buckle
is
the
finer
gold
yet
that
ring
also
has
its
when
iseult
saw
what
ring
that
was
her
heart
trembled
and
her
colour
changed
and
fearing
what
might
next
be
said
she
drew
kaherdin
apart
near
a
window
as
if
to
see
and
bargain
the
better
and
kaherdin
said
to
her
low
down
lady
tristan
is
wounded
of
a
poisoned
spear
and
is
about
to
die
he
sends
you
word
that
you
alone
can
bring
him
comfort
and
recalls
to
you
the
great
sorrows
that
you
bore
together
keep
you
the
is
but
iseult
answered
weakening
friend
i
will
follow
you
get
ready
your
ship
at
and
on
the
morrow
at
dawn
they
raised
anchor
stepped
mast
and
hoisted
sail
and
happily
the
barque
left
land
but
at
carhaix
tristan
lay
and
longed
for
iseult
s
coming
nothing
now
filled
him
any
more
and
if
he
lived
it
was
only
as
awaiting
her
and
day
by
day
he
sent
watchers
to
the
shore
to
see
if
some
ship
came
and
to
learn
the
colour
of
her
sail
there
was
no
other
thing
left
in
his
heart
he
had
himself
carried
to
the
cliff
of
the
penmarks
where
it
overlooks
the
sea
and
all
the
daylight
long
he
gazed
far
off
over
the
water
hear
now
a
tale
most
sad
and
pitiful
to
all
who
love
already
was
iseult
near
already
the
cliff
of
the
penmarks
showed
far
away
and
the
ship
ran
heartily
when
a
storm
wind
rose
on
a
sudden
and
grew
and
struck
the
sail
and
turned
the
ship
all
round
about
and
the
sailors
bore
away
and
sore
against
their
will
they
ran
before
the
wind
the
wind
raged
and
big
seas
ran
and
the
air
grew
thick
with
darkness
and
the
ocean
itself
turned
dark
and
the
rain
drove
in
gusts
the
yard
snapped
and
the
sheet
they
struck
their
sail
and
ran
with
wind
and
water
in
an
evil
hour
they
had
forgotten
to
haul
their
pinnace
aboard
it
leapt
in
their
wake
and
a
great
sea
broke
it
away
then
iseult
cried
out
god
does
not
will
that
i
should
live
to
see
him
my
love
one
time
more
god
wills
my
drowning
in
this
sea
o
tristan
had
i
spoken
to
you
but
once
again
it
is
little
i
should
have
cared
for
a
death
come
afterwards
but
now
my
love
i
can
not
come
to
you
for
god
so
wills
it
and
that
is
the
core
of
my
and
thus
the
queen
complained
so
long
as
the
storm
endured
but
after
five
days
it
died
down
kaherdin
hoisted
the
sail
the
white
sail
right
up
to
the
very
masthead
with
great
joy
the
white
sail
that
tristan
might
know
its
colour
from
afar
and
already
kaherdin
saw
britanny
far
off
like
a
cloud
hardly
were
these
things
seen
and
done
when
a
calm
came
and
the
sea
lay
even
and
untroubled
the
sail
bellied
no
longer
and
the
sailors
held
the
ship
now
up
now
down
the
tide
beating
backwards
and
forwards
in
vain
they
saw
the
shore
afar
off
but
the
storm
had
carried
their
boat
away
and
they
could
not
land
on
the
third
night
iseult
dreamt
this
dream
that
she
held
in
her
lap
a
boar
s
head
which
befouled
her
skirts
with
blood
then
she
knew
that
she
would
never
see
her
lover
again
alive
tristan
was
now
too
weak
to
keep
his
watch
from
the
cliff
of
the
penmarks
and
for
many
long
days
within
walls
far
from
the
shore
he
had
mourned
for
iseult
because
she
did
not
come
dolorous
and
alone
he
mourned
and
sighed
in
restlessness
he
was
near
death
from
desire
at
last
the
wind
freshened
and
the
white
sail
showed
then
it
was
that
iseult
of
the
white
hands
took
her
vengeance
she
came
to
where
tristan
lay
and
she
said
friend
kaherdin
is
here
i
have
seen
his
ship
upon
the
sea
she
comes
up
i
know
her
may
he
bring
that
which
shall
heal
thee
and
tristan
trembled
and
said
beautiful
friend
you
are
sure
that
the
ship
is
his
indeed
then
tell
me
what
is
the
manner
of
the
sail
i
saw
it
plain
and
well
they
have
shaken
it
out
and
hoisted
it
very
high
for
they
have
little
wind
for
its
colour
why
it
is
and
tristan
turned
him
to
the
wall
and
said
i
can
not
keep
this
life
of
mine
any
he
said
three
times
iseult
my
and
in
saying
it
the
fourth
time
he
died
then
throughout
the
house
the
knights
and
the
comrades
of
tristan
wept
out
loud
and
they
took
him
from
his
bed
and
laid
him
on
a
rich
cloth
and
they
covered
his
body
with
a
shroud
but
at
sea
the
wind
had
risen
it
struck
the
sail
fair
and
full
and
drove
the
ship
to
shore
and
iseult
the
fair
set
foot
upon
the
land
she
heard
loud
mourning
in
the
streets
and
the
tolling
of
bells
in
the
minsters
and
the
chapel
towers
she
asked
the
people
the
meaning
of
the
knell
and
of
their
tears
an
old
man
said
to
her
lady
we
suffer
a
great
grief
tristan
that
was
so
loyal
and
so
right
is
dead
he
was
open
to
the
poor
he
ministered
to
the
suffering
it
is
the
chief
evil
that
has
ever
fallen
on
this
but
iseult
hearing
them
could
not
answer
them
a
word
she
went
up
to
the
palace
following
the
way
and
her
cloak
was
random
and
wild
the
bretons
marvelled
as
she
went
nor
had
they
ever
seen
woman
of
such
a
beauty
and
they
said
who
is
she
or
whence
does
she
come
near
tristan
iseult
of
the
white
hands
crouched
maddened
at
the
evil
she
had
done
and
calling
and
lamenting
over
the
dead
man
the
other
iseult
came
in
and
said
to
her
lady
rise
and
let
me
come
by
him
i
have
more
right
to
mourn
him
than
have
me
i
loved
him
and
when
she
had
turned
to
the
east
and
prayed
god
she
moved
the
body
a
little
and
lay
down
by
the
dead
man
beside
her
friend
she
kissed
his
mouth
and
his
face
and
clasped
him
closely
and
so
gave
up
her
soul
and
died
beside
him
of
grief
for
her
lover
when
king
mark
heard
of
the
death
of
these
lovers
he
crossed
the
sea
and
came
into
brittany
and
he
had
two
coffins
hewn
for
tristan
and
iseult
one
of
chalcedony
for
iseult
and
one
of
beryl
for
tristan
and
he
took
their
beloved
bodies
away
with
him
upon
his
ship
to
tintagel
and
by
a
chantry
to
the
left
and
right
of
the
apse
he
had
their
tombs
built
round
but
in
one
night
there
sprang
from
the
tomb
of
tristan
a
green
and
leafy
briar
strong
in
its
branches
and
in
the
scent
of
its
flowers
it
climbed
the
chantry
and
fell
to
root
again
by
iseult
s
tomb
thrice
did
the
peasants
cut
it
down
but
thrice
it
grew
again
as
flowered
and
as
strong
they
told
the
marvel
to
king
mark
and
he
forbade
them
to
cut
the
briar
any
more
the
good
singers
of
old
time
beroul
and
thomas
of
built
gilbert
and
gottfried
told
this
tale
for
lovers
and
none
other
and
by
my
pen
they
beg
you
for
your
prayers
they
greet
those
who
are
cast
down
and
those
in
heart
those
troubled
and
those
filled
with
desire
may
all
herein
find
strength
against
inconstancy
and
despite
and
loss
and
pain
and
all
the
bitterness
of
loving
the
end
