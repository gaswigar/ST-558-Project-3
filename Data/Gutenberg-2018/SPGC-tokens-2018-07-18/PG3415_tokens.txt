x
the
start
for
the
pole
at
last
we
got
away
on
october
the
weather
for
the
past
few
days
had
not
been
altogether
reliable
now
windy
now
calm
now
snowing
now
clear
regular
spring
weather
in
other
words
that
day
it
continued
unsettled
it
was
misty
and
thick
in
the
morning
and
did
not
promise
well
for
the
day
but
by
there
was
a
light
breeze
from
the
east
and
at
the
same
time
it
cleared
there
was
no
need
for
a
prolonged
inquiry
into
the
sentiments
of
the
party
what
do
you
think
shall
we
start
yes
of
course
be
jogging
on
there
was
only
one
opinion
about
it
our
coursers
were
harnessed
in
a
jiffy
and
with
a
little
nod
as
much
as
to
say
see
you
we
were
off
i
do
believe
lindström
even
came
out
of
doors
to
see
us
start
such
an
everyday
affair
the
use
of
making
a
fuss
about
it
there
were
five
of
us
hanssen
wisting
hassel
bjaaland
and
myself
we
had
four
sledges
with
thirteen
dogs
to
each
at
the
start
our
sledges
were
very
light
as
we
were
only
taking
supplies
for
the
trip
to
where
all
our
cases
were
waiting
for
us
we
could
therefore
sit
on
the
sledges
and
flourish
our
whips
with
a
jaunty
air
i
sat
astride
on
wisting
sledge
and
anyone
who
had
seen
us
would
no
doubt
have
thought
a
polar
journey
looked
very
inviting
down
on
the
stood
prestrud
with
the
cinematograph
turning
the
crank
as
fast
as
he
could
go
as
we
went
past
when
we
came
up
on
to
the
barrier
on
the
other
side
he
was
there
again
turning
incessantly
the
last
thing
i
saw
as
we
went
over
the
top
of
the
ridge
and
everything
familiar
disappeared
was
a
cinematograph
it
was
coming
inland
at
full
speed
i
had
been
engaged
in
looking
out
ahead
and
turned
round
suddenly
to
throw
a
last
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
that
to
us
stood
for
all
that
was
beautiful
on
earth
when
i
caught
sight
of
what
do
you
think
a
cinematograph
he
ca
be
taking
anything
but
air
now
can
he
hardly
that
the
cinematograph
vanished
below
the
horizon
the
going
was
excellent
but
the
atmosphere
became
thicker
as
we
went
inland
for
the
first
twelve
miles
from
the
edge
of
the
barrier
i
had
been
sitting
with
hassel
but
seeing
that
wisting
dogs
could
manage
two
on
the
sledge
better
than
the
others
i
moved
hanssen
drove
first
he
had
to
steer
by
compass
alone
as
the
weather
had
got
thicker
after
him
came
bjaaland
then
hassel
and
finally
wisting
and
i
we
had
just
gone
up
a
little
slope
when
we
saw
that
it
dropped
rather
steeply
on
the
other
side
the
descent
could
not
be
more
than
yards
long
i
sat
with
my
back
to
the
dogs
looking
aft
and
was
enjoying
the
brisk
drive
then
suddenly
the
surface
by
the
side
of
the
sledge
dropped
perpendicularly
and
showed
a
yawning
black
abyss
large
enough
to
have
swallowed
us
all
and
a
little
more
a
few
inches
more
to
one
side
and
we
should
have
taken
no
part
in
the
polar
journey
we
guessed
from
this
broken
surface
that
we
had
come
too
far
to
the
east
and
altered
our
course
more
westerly
when
we
had
reached
safer
ground
i
took
the
opportunity
of
putting
on
my
ski
and
driving
so
in
this
way
the
weight
was
more
distributed
before
very
long
it
cleared
a
little
and
we
saw
one
of
our
straight
ahead
we
went
up
to
it
many
memories
clung
to
the
spot
cold
and
slaughter
of
dogs
it
was
there
we
had
killed
the
three
puppies
on
the
last
trip
we
had
then
covered
seventeen
miles
and
we
camped
well
pleased
with
the
first
day
of
our
long
journey
my
belief
that
with
all
in
one
tent
we
should
manage
our
camping
and
preparations
much
better
than
before
was
fully
justified
the
tent
went
up
as
though
it
arose
out
of
the
ground
and
everything
was
done
as
though
we
had
had
long
practice
we
found
we
had
ample
room
in
the
tent
and
our
arrangements
worked
splendidly
the
whole
time
they
were
as
follows
as
soon
as
we
halted
all
took
a
hand
at
the
tent
the
pegs
in
the
valance
of
the
tent
were
driven
in
and
wisting
crept
inside
and
planted
the
pole
while
the
rest
of
us
stretched
the
when
this
was
done
i
went
in
and
all
the
things
that
were
to
go
inside
were
handed
in
to
me
cookers
provisions
everything
was
put
in
its
place
the
primus
lighted
and
the
cooker
filled
with
snow
meanwhile
the
others
fed
their
dogs
and
let
them
loose
instead
of
the
guard
we
shovelled
loose
snow
round
the
tent
this
proved
to
be
sufficient
protection
the
dogs
respected
it
the
bindings
were
taken
off
all
our
ski
and
either
stowed
with
other
loose
articles
in
a
or
hung
up
together
with
the
harness
on
the
top
of
the
ski
which
were
lashed
upright
to
the
front
of
the
sledge
the
tent
proved
excellent
in
every
way
the
dark
colour
subdued
the
light
and
made
it
agreeable
neptune
a
fine
dog
was
let
loose
when
we
had
come
six
miles
over
the
plain
he
was
so
fat
that
he
could
not
keep
up
we
felt
certain
that
he
would
follow
us
but
he
did
not
appear
we
then
supposed
that
he
had
turned
back
and
made
for
the
but
strangely
enough
he
did
not
do
that
either
he
never
arrived
at
the
station
it
is
quite
a
mystery
what
became
of
him
rotta
another
fine
animal
was
also
set
free
she
was
not
fit
for
the
journey
and
she
afterwards
arrived
at
home
ulrik
began
by
having
a
ride
on
the
sledge
he
picked
up
later
björn
went
limping
after
the
sledge
peary
was
incapacitated
he
was
let
loose
and
followed
for
a
time
but
then
disappeared
when
the
eastern
party
afterwards
visited
the
depot
in
they
found
him
there
in
good
condition
he
was
shy
at
first
but
by
degrees
let
them
come
near
him
and
put
the
harness
on
he
did
very
good
service
after
that
uranus
and
fuchs
were
out
of
condition
this
was
pretty
bad
for
the
first
day
but
the
others
were
all
worth
their
weight
in
gold
during
the
night
it
blew
a
gale
from
the
east
but
it
moderated
in
the
morning
so
that
we
got
away
at
the
weather
did
not
hold
for
long
the
wind
came
again
with
renewed
force
from
the
same
quarter
with
thick
driving
snow
however
we
went
along
well
and
passed
flag
after
flag
after
going
nineteen
and
a
quarter
miles
we
came
to
a
snow
beacon
that
had
been
erected
at
the
beginning
of
april
and
had
stood
for
seven
months
it
was
still
quite
good
and
solid
this
gave
us
a
good
deal
to
think
about
so
we
could
depend
upon
these
beacons
they
would
not
fall
down
from
the
experience
thus
gained
we
afterwards
erected
the
whole
of
our
extensive
system
of
beacons
on
the
way
south
the
wind
went
to
the
during
the
day
it
blew
but
luckily
it
had
stopped
snowing
the
temperature
was
and
bitter
enough
against
the
wind
when
we
stopped
in
the
evening
and
set
our
tent
we
had
just
found
our
tracks
from
the
last
trip
they
were
sharp
and
clear
though
six
weeks
old
we
were
glad
to
find
them
as
we
had
seen
no
flag
for
some
time
and
were
beginning
to
get
near
the
ugly
trap
and
a
half
miles
from
the
house
that
had
been
found
on
the
last
depot
journey
so
we
had
to
be
careful
the
next
day
the
brought
very
thick
weather
a
strong
breeze
from
the
with
thick
driving
snow
it
would
not
have
been
a
day
for
crossing
the
trap
if
we
had
not
found
our
old
tracks
it
was
true
that
we
could
not
see
them
far
but
we
could
still
see
the
direction
they
took
so
as
to
be
quite
safe
i
now
set
our
course
by
east
two
points
east
was
the
original
course
and
compared
with
our
old
tracks
this
looked
right
as
the
new
course
was
considerably
more
easterly
than
the
direction
of
the
tracks
one
last
glance
over
the
to
see
whether
anything
was
forgotten
and
then
into
the
blizzard
it
was
really
vile
weather
snowing
from
above
and
drifting
from
below
so
that
one
was
quite
blinded
we
could
not
see
far
very
often
we
on
the
last
sledge
had
difficulty
in
seeing
the
first
bjaaland
was
next
in
front
of
us
for
a
long
time
we
had
been
going
markedly
downhill
and
this
was
not
in
accordance
with
our
reckoning
but
in
that
weather
one
could
not
make
much
of
a
reckoning
we
had
several
times
passed
over
crevasses
but
none
of
any
size
suddenly
we
saw
bjaaland
sledge
sink
over
he
jumped
off
and
seized
the
trace
the
sledge
lay
on
its
side
for
a
few
seconds
then
began
to
sink
more
and
more
and
finally
disappeared
altogether
bjaaland
had
got
a
good
purchase
in
the
snow
and
the
dogs
lay
down
and
dug
their
claws
in
the
sledge
sank
more
and
more
all
this
happened
in
a
few
moments
now
i
ca
hold
it
any
longer
we
wisting
and
i
had
just
come
up
he
was
holding
on
convulsively
and
resisting
with
all
his
force
but
it
was
no
use
inch
by
inch
the
sledge
sank
deeper
the
dogs
too
seemed
to
understand
the
gravity
of
the
situation
stretched
out
in
the
snow
they
dug
their
claws
in
and
resisted
with
all
their
strength
but
still
inch
by
inch
slowly
and
surely
it
went
down
into
the
abyss
bjaaland
was
right
enough
when
he
said
he
hold
on
any
longer
a
few
seconds
more
and
his
sledge
and
thirteen
dogs
would
never
have
seen
the
light
of
day
again
help
came
at
the
last
moment
hanssen
and
hassel
who
were
a
little
in
advance
when
it
happened
had
snatched
an
alpine
rope
from
a
sledge
and
came
to
his
assistance
they
made
the
rope
fast
to
the
trace
and
two
of
us
bjaaland
and
i
were
now
able
by
getting
a
good
purchase
to
hold
the
sledge
suspended
first
the
dogs
were
taken
out
then
hassel
sledge
was
drawn
back
and
placed
across
the
narrowest
part
of
the
crevasse
where
we
could
see
that
the
edges
were
solid
then
by
our
combined
efforts
the
sledge
which
was
dangling
far
below
was
hoisted
up
as
far
as
we
could
get
it
and
made
fast
to
hassel
sledge
by
the
dogs
traces
now
we
could
slack
off
and
let
go
one
sledge
hung
securely
enough
by
the
other
we
could
breathe
a
little
more
freely
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
the
sledge
right
up
and
before
we
could
manage
that
it
had
to
be
unloaded
a
man
would
have
to
go
down
on
the
rope
cast
off
the
lashings
of
the
cases
and
attach
them
again
for
drawing
up
they
all
wanted
this
job
but
wisting
had
it
he
fastened
the
alpine
rope
round
his
body
and
went
down
bjaaland
and
i
took
up
our
former
positions
and
acted
as
anchors
meanwhile
wisting
reported
what
he
saw
down
below
the
case
with
the
cooker
was
hanging
by
its
last
thread
it
was
secured
and
again
saw
the
light
of
day
hassel
and
hanssen
attended
to
the
hauling
up
of
the
cases
as
wisting
had
them
ready
these
two
fellows
moved
about
on
the
brink
of
the
chasm
with
a
coolness
that
i
regarded
at
first
with
approving
eyes
i
admire
courage
and
contempt
for
danger
but
the
length
to
which
they
carried
it
at
last
was
too
much
of
a
good
thing
they
were
simply
playing
with
fate
wisting
information
from
below
that
the
cornice
they
were
standing
on
was
only
a
few
inches
thick
did
not
seem
to
have
the
slightest
effect
on
them
on
the
contrary
they
seemed
to
stand
all
the
more
securely
we
been
lucky
said
wisting
this
is
the
only
place
where
the
crevasse
is
narrow
enough
to
put
a
sledge
across
if
we
had
gone
a
little
more
to
the
left
hanssen
looked
eagerly
in
that
direction
none
of
us
would
have
escaped
there
is
no
surface
there
only
a
crust
as
thin
as
paper
it
does
look
very
inviting
down
below
either
immense
spikes
of
ice
sticking
up
everywhere
which
would
spit
you
before
you
got
very
far
down
this
description
was
not
attractive
it
was
well
we
had
found
such
a
good
place
meanwhile
wisting
had
finished
his
work
and
was
hauled
up
when
asked
whether
he
was
not
glad
to
be
on
the
surface
again
he
answered
with
a
smile
that
it
was
nice
and
warm
down
there
we
then
hauled
the
sledge
up
and
for
the
time
being
all
was
well
but
said
hassel
we
must
be
careful
going
along
here
because
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
going
in
when
hanssen
and
i
were
bringing
up
the
sledge
he
smiled
as
though
at
a
happy
memory
hassel
had
seen
that
it
was
best
to
be
careful
there
was
no
need
to
look
for
crevasses
there
was
literally
nothing
else
to
be
seen
there
could
be
no
question
of
going
farther
into
the
trap
for
we
had
long
ago
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
spite
of
our
precautions
we
had
arrived
at
this
ugly
place
we
should
have
to
look
about
for
a
place
for
the
tent
but
that
was
easier
said
than
done
there
was
no
possibility
of
finding
a
place
large
enough
for
both
the
tent
and
the
the
tent
was
set
up
on
a
small
apparently
solid
spot
and
the
guys
stretched
across
crevasses
in
all
directions
we
were
beginning
to
be
quite
familiar
with
the
place
that
crevasse
ran
there
and
there
and
it
had
a
that
went
so
and
so
just
like
schoolboys
learning
a
lesson
meanwhile
we
had
brought
all
our
things
as
far
as
possible
into
a
place
of
safety
the
dogs
lay
harnessed
to
reduce
the
risk
of
losing
them
wisting
was
just
going
over
to
his
sledge
he
had
gone
the
same
way
several
times
before
when
suddenly
i
saw
nothing
but
his
head
shoulders
and
arms
above
the
snow
he
had
fallen
through
but
saved
himself
by
stretching
his
arms
out
as
he
fell
the
crevasse
was
bottomless
like
the
rest
we
went
into
the
tent
and
cooked
lobscouse
leaving
the
weather
to
take
care
of
itself
we
made
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
we
could
it
was
then
one
in
the
afternoon
the
wind
had
fallen
considerably
since
we
came
in
and
before
we
knew
what
was
happening
it
was
perfectly
calm
it
began
to
brighten
a
little
about
three
and
we
went
out
to
look
at
it
the
weather
was
evidently
improving
and
on
the
northern
horizon
there
was
a
sign
of
blue
sky
on
the
south
it
was
thick
far
off
in
the
densest
part
of
the
mist
we
could
vaguely
see
the
outline
of
a
elevation
and
wisting
and
hanssen
went
off
to
examine
it
the
dome
turned
out
to
be
one
of
the
small
haycock
formations
that
we
had
seen
before
in
this
district
they
struck
at
it
with
their
poles
and
just
as
they
expected
it
was
hollow
and
revealed
the
darkest
abyss
hanssen
was
positively
chuckling
with
delight
when
he
told
us
about
it
hassel
sent
him
an
envious
glance
by
it
cleared
and
a
small
reconnoitring
party
composed
of
three
started
to
find
a
way
out
of
this
i
was
one
of
the
three
so
we
had
a
long
alpine
rope
between
us
i
do
like
tumbling
in
if
i
can
avoid
it
by
such
simple
means
we
set
out
to
the
east
the
direction
that
had
brought
us
out
of
the
same
broken
ground
before
and
we
had
not
gone
more
than
a
few
paces
when
we
were
quite
out
of
it
it
was
now
clear
enough
to
look
about
us
our
tent
stood
at
the
corner
of
a
tract
that
was
full
of
hummocks
we
could
decide
beyond
a
doubt
that
this
was
the
dreaded
trap
we
continued
a
little
way
to
the
east
until
we
saw
our
course
clearly
and
then
returned
to
camp
we
did
not
waste
much
time
in
getting
things
ready
and
leaving
the
place
it
was
a
genuine
relief
to
find
ourselves
once
more
on
good
ground
and
we
resumed
our
journey
southward
at
a
brisk
pace
that
we
were
not
quite
out
of
the
dangerous
zone
was
shown
by
a
number
of
small
hummocks
to
the
south
of
us
they
extended
across
our
course
at
right
angles
we
could
also
see
from
some
long
but
narrow
crevasses
we
crossed
that
we
must
keep
a
good
when
we
came
into
the
vicinity
of
the
line
of
hummocks
that
lay
in
our
course
we
stopped
and
discussed
our
prospects
we
shall
save
a
lot
of
time
by
going
straight
on
through
here
instead
of
going
round
said
hanssen
i
had
to
admit
this
but
on
the
other
hand
the
risk
was
much
greater
oh
let
try
it
he
went
on
if
we
ca
do
it
we
ca
i
was
weak
and
allowed
myself
to
be
persuaded
and
away
we
went
among
the
haycocks
i
could
see
how
hanssen
was
enjoying
himself
this
was
just
what
he
wanted
we
went
faster
and
faster
curiously
enough
we
passed
several
of
these
formations
without
noticing
anything
and
began
to
hope
that
we
should
get
through
then
suddenly
three
leading
dogs
disappeared
and
the
others
stopped
abruptly
he
got
them
hauled
up
without
much
trouble
and
came
over
we
others
who
were
following
crossed
without
accident
but
our
further
progress
seemed
doubtful
for
after
a
few
more
paces
the
same
three
dogs
fell
in
again
we
were
now
in
exactly
the
same
kind
of
place
as
before
crevasses
ran
in
every
direction
like
a
broken
pane
of
glass
i
had
had
enough
and
would
take
no
more
part
in
this
i
announced
decisively
that
we
must
turn
back
follow
our
tracks
and
go
round
it
all
hanssen
looked
quite
disappointed
well
he
said
but
we
shall
be
over
it
directly
i
dare
say
we
shall
i
replied
but
we
must
go
back
first
this
was
evidently
hard
on
him
there
was
one
formation
in
particular
that
attracted
him
and
he
wanted
to
try
his
strength
with
it
it
was
a
that
as
far
as
appearance
went
might
just
as
well
have
been
formed
out
in
the
it
looked
as
if
it
was
formed
of
four
huge
lumps
of
ice
raised
on
end
against
each
other
we
knew
what
it
contained
without
examination
a
yawning
chasm
hanssen
cast
a
last
regretful
glance
upon
it
and
then
turned
back
we
could
now
see
all
our
surroundings
clearly
this
place
lay
as
we
had
remarked
before
in
a
hollow
we
followed
it
round
and
came
up
the
rise
on
the
south
without
accident
here
we
caught
sight
of
one
of
our
flags
it
stood
to
the
east
of
us
and
thus
confirmed
our
suspicion
that
we
had
been
going
too
far
to
the
west
we
had
one
more
contact
with
the
broken
ground
having
to
cross
some
crevasses
and
pass
a
big
hole
but
then
it
was
done
and
we
could
once
more
rejoice
in
having
solid
ice
beneath
us
hanssen
however
was
not
satisfied
till
he
had
been
to
look
into
the
hole
in
the
evening
we
reached
the
two
we
had
built
on
the
last
trip
and
we
camped
there
miles
from
the
depot
the
huts
were
drifted
up
with
snow
so
we
left
them
in
peace
and
as
the
weather
was
now
so
mild
and
fine
we
preferred
the
tent
it
had
been
an
eventful
day
and
we
had
reason
to
be
satisfied
that
we
had
come
off
so
easily
the
going
had
been
good
and
it
had
all
gone
like
a
game
when
we
started
the
next
morning
it
was
overcast
and
thick
and
before
we
had
gone
very
far
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
with
snow
so
thick
that
we
could
hardly
see
ten
ahead
of
us
we
had
intended
to
reach
the
depot
that
day
but
if
this
continued
it
was
more
than
doubtful
whether
we
should
find
it
meanwhile
we
put
on
the
pace
it
was
a
long
way
on
so
there
was
no
danger
of
driving
past
it
during
this
while
it
had
remained
clear
in
the
zenith
and
we
had
been
hoping
that
the
wind
and
snow
would
cease
but
we
had
no
such
luck
it
increased
rather
than
dropped
our
best
one
we
knew
we
could
depend
on
was
on
wisting
sledge
therefore
he
had
to
check
the
distance
at
he
turned
round
to
me
and
pointed
out
that
we
had
gone
the
exact
distance
i
called
out
to
hanssen
to
use
his
eyes
well
then
at
that
very
moment
the
depot
showed
up
a
few
to
the
left
of
us
looking
like
a
regular
palace
of
snow
in
the
thick
air
this
was
a
good
test
both
for
the
and
the
compass
we
drove
up
to
it
and
halted
there
were
three
important
points
to
be
picked
up
on
our
way
south
and
one
of
them
was
found
we
were
all
glad
and
in
good
spirits
the
miles
from
framheim
to
this
point
had
been
covered
in
four
marches
and
we
could
now
rest
our
dogs
and
give
them
as
much
seal
flesh
as
they
were
capable
of
eating
thus
far
the
trip
had
been
a
good
one
for
the
animals
with
one
exception
they
were
all
in
the
best
condition
this
exception
was
uranus
we
had
never
been
able
to
get
any
fat
on
his
bones
he
remained
thin
and
scraggy
and
awaited
his
death
at
the
depot
a
little
later
in
if
uranus
was
lanky
to
look
at
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
jaala
poor
beast
in
spite
of
her
condition
she
struggled
to
keep
up
she
did
her
utmost
but
unless
her
dimensions
were
reduced
before
we
left
she
would
have
to
accompany
uranus
to
another
world
the
cases
of
provisions
and
outfit
that
we
had
left
here
on
the
last
trip
were
almost
entirely
snowed
under
but
it
did
not
take
long
to
dig
them
out
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
cut
up
the
seals
for
the
dogs
these
grand
pieces
of
meat
with
the
blubber
attached
did
not
have
to
be
thrown
at
the
dogs
they
just
helped
themselves
as
long
as
there
was
any
meat
cut
up
and
when
that
was
finished
they
did
not
hesitate
to
attack
the
joint
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
them
as
they
lay
all
over
the
place
enjoying
their
food
it
was
all
so
delightfully
calm
and
peaceful
to
begin
with
they
were
all
hungry
and
thought
of
nothing
but
satisfying
their
immediate
cravings
but
when
this
was
done
there
was
an
end
of
the
truce
although
hai
had
only
half
finished
his
share
he
must
needs
go
up
to
rap
and
take
away
the
piece
he
was
eating
of
course
this
could
not
happen
without
a
great
row
which
resulted
in
the
appearance
of
hanssen
then
hai
made
himself
scarce
he
was
a
fine
dog
but
fearfully
obstinate
if
he
had
once
taken
a
thing
into
his
head
it
was
not
easy
to
make
him
give
it
up
on
one
of
our
depot
journeys
it
happened
that
i
was
feeding
hanssen
dogs
hai
had
made
short
work
of
his
pemmican
and
looked
round
for
more
ah
there
was
rap
enjoying
his
that
would
just
do
for
him
in
a
flash
hai
was
upon
him
forced
him
to
give
up
his
dinner
and
was
about
to
convert
it
to
his
own
use
meanwhile
i
had
witnessed
the
whole
scene
and
before
hai
knew
anything
about
it
i
was
upon
him
in
turn
i
hit
him
over
the
nose
with
the
and
tried
to
take
the
pemmican
from
him
but
it
was
not
so
easy
neither
of
us
would
give
in
and
soon
we
were
both
rolling
over
and
over
in
the
snow
struggling
for
the
mastery
i
came
off
victorious
after
a
pretty
hot
fight
and
rap
got
his
dinner
again
any
other
dog
would
have
dropped
it
at
once
on
being
hit
over
the
nose
but
not
hai
it
was
a
treat
to
get
into
the
tent
the
day
had
been
a
bitter
one
during
the
night
the
wind
went
round
to
the
north
and
all
the
snow
that
had
been
blown
northward
by
the
wind
of
the
previous
day
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
come
back
again
the
road
was
free
and
it
made
the
utmost
use
of
its
opportunity
nothing
could
be
seen
for
driving
snow
when
we
turned
out
next
morning
we
could
only
stay
where
we
were
and
console
ourselves
with
the
thought
that
it
made
no
difference
as
it
had
been
decided
that
we
were
to
remain
here
two
days
but
staying
in
a
tent
all
day
is
never
very
amusing
especially
when
one
is
compelled
to
keep
to
one
the
whole
time
you
soon
get
tired
of
talking
and
you
ca
write
all
day
long
either
eating
is
a
good
way
of
passing
the
time
if
you
can
afford
it
and
so
is
reading
if
you
have
anything
to
read
but
as
the
menu
is
limited
and
the
library
as
a
rule
somewhat
deficient
on
a
sledging
trip
these
two
expedients
fall
to
the
ground
there
is
however
one
form
of
entertainment
that
may
be
indulged
in
under
these
circumstances
without
scruple
and
that
is
a
good
nap
happy
the
man
who
can
sleep
the
clock
round
on
days
like
these
but
that
is
a
gift
that
is
not
vouchsafed
to
all
and
those
who
have
it
will
not
own
up
to
it
i
have
heard
men
snore
till
i
was
really
afraid
they
would
choke
but
as
for
acknowledging
that
they
had
been
asleep
never
some
of
them
even
have
the
coolness
to
assert
that
they
suffer
from
sleeplessness
but
it
was
not
so
bad
as
that
with
any
of
us
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
wind
dropped
and
we
went
out
to
do
some
work
we
transferred
the
old
depot
to
the
new
one
we
now
had
here
three
complete
for
which
there
would
be
little
use
and
which
therefore
were
left
behind
the
eastern
party
availed
themselves
of
part
of
these
supplies
on
their
journey
but
not
much
this
depot
is
a
fairly
large
one
and
might
come
in
useful
if
anyone
should
think
of
exploring
the
region
from
king
edward
land
southward
as
things
were
we
had
no
need
of
it
at
the
same
time
the
sledges
were
packed
and
when
evening
came
everything
was
ready
for
our
departure
there
had
really
been
no
hurry
about
this
as
we
were
going
to
stay
here
on
the
following
day
as
well
but
one
soon
learns
in
these
regions
that
it
is
best
to
take
advantage
of
good
weather
when
you
have
it
you
never
know
how
long
it
will
last
there
was
however
nothing
to
be
said
about
the
day
that
followed
we
could
doze
and
doze
as
much
as
we
liked
the
work
went
on
regularly
nevertheless
the
dogs
gnawed
and
gnawed
storing
up
strength
with
every
hour
that
went
by
we
will
now
take
a
trip
out
to
our
loaded
sledges
and
see
what
they
contain
hanssen

to
the
south
behind
it

and

they
all
look
pretty
much
alike
and
as
regards

their
loads
are
precisely

and

the

to
pretty
nearly
pounds
hanssen
sledge
differed
from
the
others
in
that
it
had
aluminium
fittings
instead
of
steel
and
no
as
it
had
to
be
free
from
iron
on
account
of
the
he
carried
each
of
the
other
three
sledges
had
a
and
compass
we
were
thus
equipped
with
three
and
four
compasses
the
instruments
we
carried
were
two
sextants
and
three
artificial
horizons
two
glass
and
one
mercury
a
hypsometer
for
measuring
heights
and
one
aneroid
for
meteorological
observations
four
thermometers
also
two
pairs
of
binoculars
we
took
a
little
travelling
case
of
medicines
from
burroughs
wellcome
and
our
surgical
instruments
were
not
many
a
dental
forceps
and
a
our
sewing
outfit
was
extensive
we
carried
a
small
very
light
tent
in
reserve
it
would
have
to
be
used
if
any
of
us
were
obliged
to
turn
back
we
also
carried
two
primus
lamps
of
paraffin
we
had
a
good
supply
and
a
half
gallons
divided
among
three
sledges
we
kept
it
in
the
usual
cans
but
they
proved
too
weak
not
that
we
lost
any
paraffin
but
bjaaland
had
to
be
constantly
soldering
to
keep
them
tight
we
had
a
good
soldering
outfit
every
man
carried
his
own
personal
bag
in
which
he
kept
reserve
clothing
diaries
and
observation
books
we
took
a
quantity
of
loose
straps
for
spare
we
had
double
for
the
first
part
of
the
time
that
is
to
say
an
inner
and
an
outer
one
there
were
five
watches
among
us
of
which
three
were
chronometer
watches
we
had
decided
to
cover
the
distance
between
and
in
daily
marches
of
seventeen
miles
we
could
easily
have
done
twice
this
but
as
it
was
more
important
to
arrive
than
to
show
great
speed
we
limited
the
distance
besides
which
here
between
the
depots
we
had
sufficient
food
to
allow
us
to
take
our
time
we
were
interested
in
seeing
how
the
dogs
would
manage
the
loaded
sledges
we
expected
them
to
do
well
but
not
so
well
as
they
did
on
october
we
left
with
a
light
breeze
clear
and
mild
i
was
now
to
take
up
my
position
in
advance
of
the
sledges
and
placed
myself
a
few
paces
in
front
of
hanssen
with
my
ski
pointing
in
the
right
direction
a
last
look
behind
me
all
ready
and
away
i
went
i
thought
no
i
did
have
time
to
think
before
i
knew
anything
about
it
i
was
sent
flying
by
the
dogs
in
the
confusion
that
ensued
they
stopped
luckily
so
that
i
escaped
without
damage
as
far
as
that
went
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
angry
but
as
i
had
sense
enough
to
see
that
the
situation
already
sufficiently
comic
would
be
doubly
ridiculous
if
i
allowed
my
annoyance
to
show
itself
i
wisely
kept
quiet
and
after
all
whose
fault
was
it
i
was
really
the
only
one
to
blame
why
in
the
world
had
i
not
got
away
faster
i
now
changed
my
plan
entirely
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
that
i
hope
and
fell
in
with
the
awkward
squad
there
i
was
more
successful
all
ready
go
and
go
they
did
first
hanssen
went
off
like
a
meteor
close
behind
him
came
wisting
and
then
bjaaland
and
hassel
they
all
had
ski
on
and
were
driving
with
a
line
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
follow
in
the
rear
as
i
thought
the
dogs
would
not
keep
this
up
for
long
but
i
soon
had
enough
of
it
we
did
the
first
six
and
a
quarter
miles
in
an
hour
i
thought
that
would
do
for
me
so
i
went
up
to
wisting
made
a
rope
fast
to
his
sledge
and
there
i
stood
till
we
reached
three
hundred
and
forty
miles
yes
that
was
a
pleasant
surprise
we
had
never
dreamed
of
anything
of
the
sort
driving
on
ski
to
the
pole
thanks
to
hanssen
brilliant
talents
as
a
we
could
easily
do
this
he
had
his
dogs
well
in
hand
and
they
knew
their
master
they
knew
that
the
moment
they
failed
to
do
their
duty
they
would
be
pulled
up
and
a
hiding
all
round
would
follow
of
course
as
always
happens
nature
occasionally
got
the
better
of
discipline
but
the
confirmation
that
resulted
checked
any
repetition
of
such
conduct
for
a
long
while
the
day
march
was
soon
completed
in
this
way
and
we
camped
early
on
the
following
day
we
were
already
in
sight
of
the
large
on
the
east
which
we
had
seen
for
the
first
time
on
the
second
depot
journey
between
and
and
this
showed
that
the
atmosphere
must
be
very
clear
we
could
not
see
any
greater
number
than
the
first
time
however
from
our
experience
of
beacons
built
of
snow
we
could
see
that
if
we
built
such
beacons
now
on
our
way
south
they
would
be
splendid
marks
for
our
return
journey
we
therefore
decided
to
adopt
this
system
of
landmarks
to
the
greatest
possible
extent
we
built
in
all
beacons
feet
high
and
used
in
their
construction
blocks
cut
out
of
the
snow
with
specially
large
in
each
of
them
was
deposited
a
paper
giving
the
number
and
position
of
the
beacon
and
indicating
the
distance
and
the
direction
to
be
taken
to
reach
the
next
beacon
to
the
north
it
may
appear
that
my
prudence
was
exaggerated
but
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
one
could
not
be
too
careful
on
this
endless
uniform
surface
if
we
lost
our
way
here
it
would
be
difficult
enough
to
reach
home
besides
which
the
building
of
these
beacons
had
other
advantages
which
we
could
all
see
and
appreciate
every
time
we
stopped
to
build
one
the
dogs
had
a
rest
and
they
wanted
this
if
they
were
to
keep
up
the
pace
we
erected
the
first
beacon
in
to
begin
with
we
contented
ourselves
with
putting
them
up
at
every
thirteenth
or
fifteenth
kilometre
on
the
we
shot
the
first
dog
hanssen
bone
he
was
too
old
to
keep
up
and
was
only
a
hindrance
he
was
placed
in
depot
under
a
beacon
and
was
a
great
joy
to
us
or
rather
to
the
dogs
later
on
on
the
same
day
we
reached
the
second
important
point
the
depot
in
our
course
took
us
very
slightly
to
the
east
of
it
the
small
pieces
of
that
had
been
used
as
marks
on
each
side
of
the
depot
could
be
seen
a
long
way
off
on
a
subsequent
examination
they
showed
no
sign
of
snowfall
they
stood
just
as
they
had
been
put
in
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
depot
we
crossed
two
quite
respectable
crevasses
they
were
apparently
filled
up
and
caused
us
no
trouble
we
reached
the
depot
at
everything
was
in
the
best
of
order
the
flag
was
flying
and
hardly
looked
as
if
it
had
been
up
a
day
although
it
had
now
been
waving
there
for
nearly
eight
months
the
drifts
round
the
depot
were
about
feet
high
the
next
day
was
brilliant
calm
and
clear
the
sun
really
baked
the
skin
of
one
face
we
put
all
our
skin
clothing
out
to
dry
a
little
rime
will
always
form
at
the
bottom
of
a
we
also
availed
ourselves
of
this
good
opportunity
to
determine
our
position
and
check
our
compasses
they
proved
to
be
correct
we
replaced
the
provisions
we
had
consumed
on
the
way
and
resumed
our
journey
on
october
there
was
a
thick
fog
next
morning
and
very
disagreeable
weather
perhaps
we
felt
it
more
after
the
previous
fine
day
when
we
passed
this
way
for
the
first
time
going
south
hanssen
dogs
had
fallen
into
a
crevasse
but
it
was
nothing
to
speak
of
otherwise
we
had
no
trouble
nor
did
we
expect
any
this
time
but
in
these
regions
what
one
least
expects
frequently
happens
the
snow
was
loose
and
the
going
heavy
from
time
to
time
we
crossed
a
narrow
crevasse
once
we
saw
through
the
fog
a
large
open
hole
we
could
not
have
been
very
far
from
it
or
we
should
not
have
seen
it
the
weather
was
so
thick
but
all
went
well
till
we
had
come
thirteen
and
a
half
miles
then
hanssen
had
to
cross
a
crevasse
a
yard
wide
and
in
doing
it
he
was
unlucky
enough
to
catch
the
point
of
his
ski
in
the
traces
of
the
hindmost
dogs
and
fall
right
across
the
crevasse
this
looked
unpleasant
the
dogs
were
across
and
a
foot
or
two
on
the
other
side
but
the
sledge
was
right
over
the
crevasse
and
had
twisted
as
hanssen
fell
so
that
a
little
more
would
bring
it
into
line
with
the
crevasse
and
then
of
course
down
it
would
go
the
dogs
had
quickly
scented
the
fact
that
their
lord
and
master
was
for
the
moment
incapable
of
administering
a
confirmation
and
they
did
not
let
slip
the
golden
opportunity
like
a
lot
of
roaring
tigers
the
whole
team
set
upon
each
other
and
fought
till
the
hair
flew
this
naturally
produced
short
sharp
jerks
at
the
traces
so
that
the
sledge
worked
round
more
and
more
and
at
the
same
time
the
dogs
in
the
heat
of
the
combat
were
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
brink
if
this
went
on
all
was
irretrievably
lost
one
of
us
jumped
the
crevasse
went
into
the
middle
of
the
struggling
team
and
fortunately
got
them
to
stop
at
the
same
time
wisting
threw
a
line
to
hanssen
and
hauled
him
out
of
his
unpleasant
position
although
i
thought
to
myself
as
we
went
on
i
wonder
whether
hanssen
did
not
enjoy
the
situation
stretched
across
a
giddy
abyss
with
the
prospect
of
slipping
down
it
at
any
moment
that
was
just
what
he
would
like
we
secured
the
sledge
completed
our
seventeen
miles
and
camped
from
we
began
to
erect
beacons
at
every
nine
kilometres
the
next
day
we
observed
the
lowest
temperature
of
the
whole
of
this
journey
f
the
wind
was
but
not
very
strong
it
did
not
feel
like
summer
all
the
same
we
now
adopted
the
habit
which
we
kept
up
all
the
way
to
the
south
of
taking
our
lunch
while
building
the
beacon
that
lay
in
our
day
march
it
was
nothing
very
luxurious
three
or
four
dry
oatmeal
biscuits
that
was
all
if
one
wanted
a
drink
one
could
mix
snow
with
the
biscuit
bread
and
water
it
is
a
diet
that
is
not
much
sought
after
in
our
native
latitudes
but
latitude
makes
a
very
great
difference
in
this
world
it
anybody
had
offered
us
more
bread
and
water
we
should
gladly
have
accepted
it
that
day
we
crossed
the
last
crevasse
for
a
long
time
to
come
and
it
was
only
a
few
inches
wide
the
surface
looked
grand
ahead
of
us
it
went
in
very
long
almost
imperceptible
undulations
we
could
only
notice
them
by
the
way
in
which
the
beacons
we
put
up
often
disappeared
rather
rapidly
on
november
we
had
a
gale
from
the
south
with
heavy
snow
the
going
was
very
stiff
but
the
dogs
got
the
sledges
along
better
than
we
expected
the
temperature
rose
as
usual
with
a
wind
from
this
quarter
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
out
in
such
a
temperature
although
it
did
blow
a
little
the
day
after
we
had
a
light
breeze
from
the
north
the
heavy
going
of
the
day
before
had
completely
disappeared
instead
of
it
we
had
the
best
surface
one
could
desire
and
it
made
our
dogs
break
into
a
brisk
gallop
that
was
the
day
we
were
to
reach
the
depot
in
but
as
it
was
extremely
thick
our
chances
of
doing
so
were
small
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
distance
was
accomplished
but
no
depot
was
visible
however
our
range
of
vision
was
nothing
to
boast
of
ten
not
more
the
most
sensible
thing
to
do
under
the
circumstances
was
to
camp
and
wait
till
it
cleared
at
four
next
morning
the
sun
broke
through
we
let
it
get
warm
and
disperse
the
fog
and
then
went
out
what
a
morning
it
was
radiantly
clear
and
mild
so
still
so
still
lay
the
mighty
desert
before
us
level
and
white
on
every
side
but
no
there
in
the
distance
the
level
was
broken
there
was
a
touch
of
colour
on
the
white
the
third
important
point
was
reached
the
extreme
outpost
of
civilization
our
last
depot
lay
before
us
that
was
an
unspeakable
relief
the
victory
now
seemed
half
won
in
the
fog
we
had
come
about
three
and
a
half
miles
too
far
to
the
west
but
we
now
saw
that
if
we
had
continued
our
march
the
day
before
we
should
have
come
right
into
our
line
of
flags
there
they
stood
flag
after
flag
and
the
little
strip
of
black
cloth
seemed
to
wave
quite
proudly
as
though
it
claimed
credit
for
the
way
in
which
it
had
discharged
its
duty
here
as
at
the
depot
in
there
was
hardly
a
sign
of
snowfall
the
drift
round
the
depot
had
reached
the
same
height
as
there
feet
clearly
the
same
conditions
of
weather
had
prevailed
all
over
this
region
the
depot
stood
as
we
had
made
it
and
the
sledge
as
we
had
left
it
falling
snow
and
drift
had
not
been
sufficient
to
cover
even
this
the
little
drift
that
there
was
offered
an
excellent
place
for
the
tent
being
hard
and
firm
we
at
once
set
about
the
work
that
had
to
be
done
first
uranus
was
sent
into
the
next
world
and
although
he
had
always
given
us
the
impression
of
being
thin
and
bony
it
was
now
seen
that
there
were
masses
of
fat
along
his
back
he
would
be
much
appreciated
when
we
reached
here
on
the
return
jaala
did
not
look
as
if
she
would
fulfil
the
conditions
but
we
gave
her
another
night
the
dogs
pemmican
in
the
depot
was
just
enough
to
give
the
dogs
a
good
feed
and
load
up
the
sledges
again
we
were
so
well
supplied
with
all
other
provisions
that
we
were
able
to
leave
a
considerable
quantity
behind
for
the
return
journey
next
day
we
stayed
here
to
give
the
dogs
a
thorough
rest
for
the
last
time
we
took
advantage
of
the
fine
weather
to
dry
our
outfit
and
check
our
instruments
when
evening
came
we
were
all
ready
and
now
we
could
look
back
with
satisfaction
to
the
good
work
of
the
autumn
we
had
fully
accomplished
what
we
aimed
at
namely
transferring
our
base
from
to
jaala
had
to
follow
uranus
they
were
both
laid
on
the
top
of
the
depot
beside
eight
little
ones
that
never
saw
the
light
of
day
during
our
stay
here
we
decided
to
build
beacons
at
every
fifth
kilometre
and
to
lay
down
depots
at
every
degree
of
latitude
although
the
dogs
were
drawing
the
sledges
easily
at
present
we
knew
well
enough
that
in
the
they
would
find
it
hard
work
if
they
were
always
to
have
heavy
weights
to
pull
the
more
we
could
get
rid
of
and
the
sooner
we
could
begin
to
do
so
the
better
on
november
at
we
left
now
the
unknown
lay
before
us
now
our
work
began
in
earnest
the
appearance
of
the
barrier
was
the
same
everywhere
flat
with
a
splendid
surface
at
the
first
beacon
we
put
up
we
had
to
shoot
lucy
we
were
sorry
to
put
an
end
to
this
beautiful
creature
but
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
her
friends
karenius
sauen
and
schwartz
scowled
up
at
the
beacon
where
she
lay
as
they
passed
but
duty
called
and
the
whip
sang
dangerously
near
them
though
they
did
not
seem
to
hear
it
we
had
now
extended
our
daily
march
to
miles
in
this
way
we
should
do
a
degree
in
three
days
on
the
we
decided
to
stop
for
a
day
rest
the
dogs
had
been
picking
up
wonderfully
every
day
and
were
now
at
the
top
of
their
condition
as
far
as
health
and
training
went
with
the
greatest
ease
they
covered
the
day
march
at
a
pace
of
seven
and
a
half
kilometres
four
miles
and
an
hour
as
for
ourselves
we
never
had
to
move
a
foot
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
let
ourselves
be
towed
the
same
evening
we
had
to
put
an
end
to
the
last
of
our
ladies
else
she
was
hassel
pride
and
the
ornament
of
his
team
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
she
was
also
placed
at
the
top
of
a
beacon
when
we
halted
that
evening
in
we
saw
on
the
horizon
several
heavy
masses
of
cloud
such
as
are
usually
to
be
seen
over
land
we
could
make
out
no
land
that
evening
however
but
when
we
came
out
next
morning
and
directed
our
glasses
to
that
quarter
the
land
lay
there
lofty
and
clear
in
the
morning
sun
we
were
now
able
to
distinguish
several
summits
and
to
determine
that
this
was
the
land
extending
from
beardmore
glacier
in
south
victoria
land
our
course
had
been
true
south
all
the
time
at
this
spot
we
were
about
miles
to
the
east
of
beardmore
glacier
our
course
would
continue
to
be
true
south
the
same
evening
november
we
reached
by
dead
reckoning
the
noon
altitude
next
day
gave
the
depot
we
built
here
contained
provisions
for
five
men
and
twelve
dogs
for
four
days
it
was
made
square
feet
each
way
of
hard
solid
blocks
of
snow
a
large
flag
was
placed
on
the
top
that
evening
a
strange
thing
happened
three
dogs
deserted
going
northward
on
our
old
tracks
they
were
lucy
favourites
and
had
probably
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
they
ought
to
go
back
and
look
after
their
friend
it
was
a
great
loss
to
us
all
but
especially
to
bjaaland
they
were
all
three
animals
and
among
the
best
we
had
he
had
to
borrow
a
dog
from
hanssen
team
and
if
he
did
not
go
quite
so
smoothly
as
before
he
was
still
able
to
keep
up
on
the
we
got
a
bearing
of
the
mountain
chain
right
down
in
south
by
west
true
each
day
we
drew
considerably
nearer
the
land
and
could
see
more
and
more
of
its
details
mighty
peaks
each
loftier
and
wilder
than
the
last
rose
to
heights
of
feet
what
struck
us
all
were
the
bare
sides
that
many
of
these
mountains
showed
we
had
expected
to
see
them
far
more
covered
with
snow
mount
fridtjof
nansen
for
example
had
quite
a
look
only
quite
at
the
summit
was
it
crowned
by
a
mighty
hood
of
ice
that
raised
its
shining
top
to
some
feet
farther
to
the
south
rose
mount
don
pedro
christophersen
it
was
more
covered
with
snow
but
the
long
gabled
summit
was
to
a
great
extent
bare
still
farther
south
mounts
alice
wedel
jarlsberg
alice
gade
and
ruth
gade
came
in
sight
all
from
peak
to
base
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
seen
a
more
beautiful
or
wilder
landscape
even
from
where
we
were
we
seemed
to
be
able
to
see
a
way
up
from
several
places
there
lay
liv
glacier
for
instance
which
would
undoubtedly
afford
a
good
and
even
ascent
but
it
lay
too
far
to
the
north
it
is
of
enormous
extent
and
would
prove
interesting
to
explore
crown
prince
olav
mountains
looked
less
promising
but
they
also
lay
too
far
to
the
north
a
little
to
the
west
of
south
lay
an
apparently
good
way
up
the
mountains
nearest
to
the
barrier
did
not
seem
to
offer
any
great
obstruction
what
one
might
find
later
between
mounts
pedro
christophersen
and
fridtjof
nansen
was
not
easy
to
say
on
the
we
reached
on
that
day
we
made
the
interesting
discovery
of
a
chain
of
mountains
running
to
the
east
this
as
it
appeared
from
the
spot
where
we
were
formed
a
semicircle
where
it
joined
the
mountains
of
south
victoria
land
this
semicircle
lay
true
south
and
our
course
was
directed
straight
towards
it
in
the
depot
in
we
left
besides
the
usual
quantity
of
provisions
for
five
men
and
twelve
dogs
for
four
days
a
can
of
paraffin
holding
litres
about
gallons
we
had
abundance
of
matches
and
could
therefore
distribute
them
over
all
the
depots
the
barrier
continued
as
flat
as
before
and
the
going
was
as
good
as
it
could
possibly
be
we
had
thought
that
a
day
rest
would
be
needed
by
the
dogs
for
every
degree
of
latitude
but
this
proved
superfluous
it
looked
as
if
they
could
no
longer
be
tired
one
or
two
had
shown
signs
of
bad
feet
but
were
now
perfectly
well
instead
of
losing
strength
the
dogs
seemed
to
become
stronger
and
more
active
every
day
now
they
too
had
sighted
the
land
and
the
black
mass
of
mount
fridtjof
nansen
seemed
specially
to
appeal
to
them
hanssen
often
had
hard
work
to
keep
them
in
the
right
course
without
any
longer
stay
then
we
left
the
next
day
and
steered
for
the
bay
ahead
that
day
we
went
miles
in
thick
fog
and
saw
nothing
of
the
land
it
was
hard
to
have
to
travel
thus
blindly
off
an
unknown
coast
but
we
could
only
hope
for
better
weather
during
the
previous
night
we
had
heard
for
a
change
a
noise
in
the
ice
it
was
nothing
very
great
and
sounded
like
scattered
infantry
fire
a
few
here
and
there
underneath
our
tent
the
artillery
had
not
come
up
yet
we
took
no
notice
of
it
though
i
heard
one
man
say
in
the
morning
blest
if
i
did
think
i
got
a
whack
on
the
ear
last
night
i
could
witness
that
it
had
not
cost
him
his
sleep
as
that
night
he
had
very
nearly
snored
us
all
out
of
the
tent
during
the
forenoon
we
crossed
a
number
of
apparently
crevasses
most
of
them
only
about
an
inch
wide
there
had
thus
been
a
small
local
disturbance
occasioned
by
one
of
the
numerous
small
glaciers
on
land
on
the
following
night
all
was
quiet
again
and
we
never
afterwards
heard
the
slightest
sound
on
november
we
reached
we
were
now
rapidly
approaching
land
the
mountain
range
on
the
east
appeared
to
turn
our
line
of
ascent
which
we
had
chosen
long
ago
and
now
had
our
eyes
fixed
upon
as
we
went
would
take
us
a
trifle
to
the
west
of
south
but
so
little
that
the
digression
was
of
no
account
the
semicircle
we
saw
to
the
south
made
a
more
disquieting
impression
and
looked
as
if
it
would
offer
great
irregularities
on
the
following
day
the
character
of
the
surface
began
to
change
great
formations
seemed
to
roll
higher
and
higher
as
they
approached
the
land
and
in
one
of
the
troughs
of
these
we
found
the
surface
greatly
disturbed
at
some
bygone
time
immense
fissures
and
chasms
would
have
rendered
its
passage
practically
impossible
but
now
they
were
all
drifted
up
and
we
had
no
difficulty
in
crossing
that
day
november
we
reached
and
camped
at
the
top
of
one
of
these
swelling
waves
the
valley
we
were
to
cross
next
day
was
fairly
broad
and
rose
considerably
on
the
other
side
on
the
west
in
the
direction
of
the
nearest
land
the
undulation
rose
to
such
a
height
that
it
concealed
a
great
part
of
the
land
from
us
during
the
afternoon
we
built
the
usual
depot
and
continued
our
journey
on
the
following
day
as
we
had
seen
from
our
it
was
an
immense
undulation
that
we
had
to
traverse
the
ascent
on
the
other
side
felt
uncomfortably
warm
in
the
powerful
sun
but
it
was
no
higher
than
feet
by
the
aneroid
from
the
top
of
this
wave
the
barrier
stretched
away
before
us
flat
at
first
but
we
could
see
disturbances
of
the
surface
in
the
distance
now
we
are
going
to
have
some
fun
in
getting
to
land
i
thought
for
it
seemed
very
natural
that
the
barrier
hemmed
in
as
it
was
here
would
be
much
broken
up
the
disturbances
we
had
seen
consisted
of
some
big
old
crevasses
which
were
partly
filled
up
we
avoided
them
easily
now
there
was
another
deep
depression
before
us
with
a
correspondingly
high
rise
on
the
other
side
we
went
over
it
capitally
the
surface
was
absolutely
smooth
without
a
sign
of
fissure
or
hole
anywhere
then
we
shall
get
them
when
we
are
on
the
top
i
thought
it
was
rather
stiff
work
uphill
unaccustomed
as
we
were
to
slopes
i
stretched
my
neck
more
and
more
to
get
a
view
at
last
we
were
up
and
what
a
sight
it
was
that
met
us
not
an
irregularity
not
a
sign
of
disturbance
quietly
and
evenly
the
ascent
continued
i
believe
that
we
were
then
already
above
land
the
large
crevasses
that
we
had
avoided
down
below
probably
formed
the
boundary
the
hypsometer
gave
feet
above
the
sea
we
were
now
immediately
below
the
ascent
and
made
the
final
decision
of
trying
it
here
this
being
settled
we
pitched
our
camp
it
was
still
early
in
the
day
but
we
had
a
great
deal
to
arrange
before
the
morrow
here
we
should
have
to
overhaul
our
whole
supply
of
provisions
take
with
us
what
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
remainder
of
the
trip
and
leave
the
rest
behind
in
depot
first
then
we
camped
worked
out
our
position
fed
the
dogs
and
let
them
loose
again
and
then
went
into
our
tent
to
have
something
to
eat
and
go
through
the
provision
books
we
had
now
reached
one
of
the
most
critical
points
of
our
journey
our
plan
had
now
to
be
laid
so
that
we
might
not
only
make
the
ascent
as
easily
as
possible
but
also
get
through
to
the
end
our
calculations
had
to
be
made
carefully
and
every
possibility
taken
into
account
as
with
every
decision
of
importance
we
discussed
the
matter
jointly
the
distance
we
had
before
us
from
this
spot
to
the
pole
and
back
was
miles
reckoning
with
the
ascent
that
we
saw
before
us
with
other
unforeseen
obstructions
and
finally
with
the
certain
factor
that
the
strength
of
our
dogs
would
be
gradually
reduced
to
a
fraction
of
what
it
now
was
we
decided
to
take
provisions
and
equipment
for
sixty
days
on
the
sledges
and
to
leave
the
remaining
supplies
enough
for
thirty
days
and
outfit
in
depot
we
calculated
from
the
experience
we
had
had
that
we
ought
to
be
able
to
reach
this
point
again
with
twelve
dogs
left
we
now
had
dogs
our
plan
was
to
take
all
the
up
to
the
plateau
there
of
them
were
to
be
slaughtered
and
the
journey
continued
with
three
sledges
and
eighteen
dogs
of
these
last
eighteen
it
would
be
necessary
in
our
opinion
to
slaughter
six
in
order
to
bring
the
other
twelve
back
to
this
point
as
the
number
of
dogs
grew
less
the
sledges
would
become
lighter
and
lighter
and
when
the
time
came
for
reducing
their
number
to
twelve
we
should
only
have
two
sledges
left
this
time
again
our
calculations
came
out
approximately
right
it
was
only
in
reckoning
the
number
of
days
that
we
made
a
little
mistake
we
took
eight
days
less
than
the
time
allowed
the
number
of
dogs
agreed
exactly
we
reached
this
point
again
with
twelve
after
the
question
had
been
well
discussed
and
each
had
given
his
opinion
we
went
out
to
get
the
repacking
done
it
was
lucky
the
weather
was
so
fine
otherwise
this
taking
stock
of
provisions
might
have
been
a
bitter
piece
of
work
all
our
supplies
were
in
such
a
form
that
we
could
count
them
instead
of
weighing
them
our
pemmican
was
in
rations
of
kilogram
pound
ounces
the
chocolate
was
divided
into
small
pieces
as
chocolate
always
is
so
that
we
knew
what
each
piece
weighed
our
was
put
up
in
bags
of
ounces
just
enough
for
a
meal
our
biscuits
possessed
the
same
property
they
could
be
counted
but
this
was
a
tedious
business
as
they
were
rather
small
on
this
occasion
we
had
to
count
biscuits
our
provisions
consisted
only
of
these
four
kinds
and
the
combination
turned
out
right
enough
we
did
not
suffer
from
a
craving
either
for
fat
or
sugar
though
the
want
of
these
substances
is
very
commonly
felt
on
such
journeys
as
ours
in
our
biscuits
we
had
an
excellent
product
consisting
of
oatmeal
sugar
and
dried
milk
sweetmeats
jam
fruit
cheese
we
had
left
behind
at
framheim
we
took
our
clothing
for
which
we
had
had
no
use
as
yet
on
the
sledges
we
were
now
coming
on
to
the
high
ground
and
it
might
easily
happen
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
we
did
not
forget
the
temperature
of
that
shackleton
had
experienced
in
and
if
we
met
with
the
same
we
could
hold
out
a
long
while
if
we
had
the
skin
clothing
otherwise
we
had
not
very
much
in
our
bags
the
only
change
we
had
with
us
was
put
on
here
and
the
old
clothes
hung
out
to
air
we
reckoned
that
by
the
time
we
came
back
in
a
couple
of
months
they
would
be
sufficiently
aired
and
we
could
put
them
on
again
as
far
as
i
remember
the
calculation
proved
correct
we
took
more
than
anything
else
if
one
feet
are
well
shod
one
can
hold
out
a
long
time
when
all
this
was
finished
three
of
us
put
on
our
ski
and
made
for
the
nearest
visible
land
this
was
a
little
peak
a
mile
and
away
mount
betty
it
did
not
look
lofty
or
imposing
but
was
nevertheless
feet
above
the
sea
small
as
it
was
it
became
important
to
us
as
it
was
there
we
got
all
our
geological
specimens
running
on
ski
felt
quite
strange
although
i
had
now
covered
miles
on
them
but
we
had
driven
the
whole
way
and
were
somewhat
out
of
training
we
could
feel
this
too
as
we
went
up
the
slope
that
afternoon
after
mount
betty
the
ascent
became
rather
steep
but
the
surface
was
even
and
the
going
splendid
so
we
got
on
fast
first
we
came
up
a
smooth
about
feet
above
the
sea
then
over
a
little
plateau
after
that
another
smooth
slope
like
the
first
and
then
down
a
rather
long
flat
stretch
which
after
a
time
began
to
rise
very
gradually
until
it
finally
passed
into
small
glacier
formations
our
reconnaissance
extended
to
these
small
glaciers
we
had
ascertained
that
the
way
was
practicable
as
far
as
we
were
able
to
see
we
had
gone
about
five
and
a
half
miles
from
the
tent
and
ascended
feet
on
the
way
back
we
went
gloriously
the
last
two
slopes
down
to
the
barrier
gave
us
all
the
speed
we
wanted
bjaaland
and
i
had
decided
to
take
a
turn
round
by
mount
betty
for
the
sake
of
having
real
bare
ground
under
our
feet
we
had
not
felt
it
since
madeira
in
september
and
now
we
were
in
november
no
sooner
said
than
done
bjaaland
prepared
for
an
elegant
telemark
swing
and
executed
it
in
fine
style
what
i
prepared
to
do
i
am
still
not
quite
sure
what
i
did
was
to
roll
over
and
i
did
it
with
great
effect
i
was
very
soon
on
my
feet
again
and
glanced
at
bjaaland
whether
he
had
seen
my
tumble
i
am
not
certain
however
i
pulled
myself
together
after
this
unfortunate
performance
and
remarked
casually
that
it
is
not
so
easy
to
forget
what
one
has
once
learnt
no
doubt
he
thought
that
i
had
managed
the
telemark
swing
at
any
rate
he
was
polite
enough
to
let
me
think
so
mount
betty
offered
no
perpendicular
crags
or
deep
precipices
to
stimulate
our
desire
for
climbing
we
only
had
to
take
off
our
ski
and
then
we
arrived
at
the
top
it
consisted
of
loose
screes
and
was
not
an
ideal
promenade
for
people
who
had
to
be
careful
of
their
boots
it
was
a
pleasure
to
set
one
foot
on
bare
ground
again
and
we
sat
down
on
the
rocks
to
enjoy
the
scene
the
rocks
very
soon
made
themselves
felt
however
and
brought
us
to
our
feet
again
we
photographed
each
other
in
picturesque
attitudes
took
a
few
stones
for
those
who
had
not
yet
set
foot
on
bare
earth
and
strapped
on
our
ski
the
dogs
after
having
been
so
eager
to
make
for
bare
land
when
they
first
saw
it
were
now
not
the
least
interested
in
it
they
lay
on
the
snow
and
did
not
go
near
the
top
between
the
bare
ground
and
the
snow
surface
there
was
bright
ice
showing
that
at
times
there
was
running
water
here
the
dogs
did
what
they
could
to
keep
up
with
us
on
the
way
down
but
they
were
soon
left
behind
on
our
return
we
surprised
our
comrades
with
presents
from
the
country
but
i
fear
they
were
not
greatly
appreciated
i
could
hear
such
words
as
heaps
of
them
and
i
was
able
to
put
them
together
and
understand
what
was
meant
the
presents
were
put
in
depot
as
not
absolutely
indispensable
on
the
southern
journey
by
this
time
the
dogs
had
already
begun
to
be
very
voracious
everything
that
came
in
their
way
disappeared
whips
lashings
were
regarded
as
delicacies
if
one
put
down
anything
for
a
moment
it
vanished
with
some
of
them
this
voracity
went
so
far
that
we
had
to
chain
them
chapter
xi
through
the
mountains
on
the
following
day
november
we
began
the
ascent
to
provide
for
any
contingency
i
left
in
the
depot
a
paper
with
information
of
the
way
we
intended
to
take
through
the
mountains
together
with
our
plan
for
the
future
our
outfit
provisions
etc
the
weather
was
fine
as
usual
and
the
going
good
the
dogs
exceeded
our
expectations
they
negotiated
the
two
fairly
steep
slopes
at
a
we
began
to
think
there
was
no
difficulty
they
could
not
surmount
the
five
miles
or
so
that
we
had
gone
the
day
before
and
imagined
would
be
more
than
enough
for
this
day
journey
were
now
covered
with
full
loads
in
shorter
time
the
small
glaciers
higher
up
turned
out
fairly
steep
and
in
some
places
we
had
to
take
two
sledges
at
a
time
with
double
teams
these
glaciers
had
an
appearance
of
being
very
old
and
of
having
entirely
ceased
to
move
there
were
no
new
crevasses
to
be
seen
those
that
there
were
were
large
and
wide
but
their
edges
were
rounded
off
everywhere
and
the
crevasses
themselves
were
almost
entirely
filled
with
snow
so
as
not
to
fall
into
these
on
the
return
we
erected
our
beacons
in
such
a
way
that
the
line
between
any
two
of
them
would
take
us
clear
of
any
danger
it
was
no
use
working
in
polar
clothing
among
these
hills
the
sun
which
stood
high
and
clear
was
uncomfortably
warm
and
we
were
obliged
to
take
off
most
of
our
things
we
passed
several
summits
from
to
feet
high
the
snow
on
one
of
them
had
quite
a
tint
our
distance
this
first
day
was
eleven
and
a
half
miles
with
a
rise
of
feet
our
camp
that
evening
lay
on
a
little
glacier
among
huge
crevasses
on
three
sides
of
us
were
towering
summits
when
we
had
set
our
tent
two
parties
went
out
to
explore
the
way
in
advance
one
party
wisting
and
hanssen
took
the
way
that
looked
easiest
from
the
tent
namely
the
course
of
the
glacier
it
here
rose
rapidly
to
feet
and
disappeared
in
a
direction
between
two
peaks
bjaaland
formed
the
other
party
he
evidently
looked
upon
this
ascent
as
too
tame
and
started
up
the
steepest
part
of
the
mountain
side
i
saw
him
disappear
up
aloft
like
a
fly
hassel
and
i
attended
to
the
necessary
work
round
about
and
in
the
tent
we
were
sitting
inside
chatting
when
we
suddenly
heard
someone
come
swishing
down
towards
the
tent
we
looked
at
each
other
that
fellow
had
some
pace
on
we
had
no
doubt
as
to
who
it
was
bjaaland
of
course
he
must
have
gone
off
to
refresh
old
memories
he
had
a
lot
to
tell
us
amongst
other
things
he
had
found
the
finest
descent
on
the
other
side
what
he
meant
by
fine
i
was
not
certain
if
it
was
as
fine
as
the
ascent
he
had
made
then
i
asked
to
be
excused
we
now
heard
the
others
coming
and
these
we
could
hear
a
long
way
off
they
had
also
seen
a
great
deal
not
to
mention
the
finest
descent
but
both
parties
agreed
in
the
mournful
intelligence
that
we
should
have
to
go
down
again
they
had
both
observed
the
immense
glacier
that
stretched
beneath
us
running
east
and
west
a
lengthy
discussion
took
place
between
the
two
parties
who
mutually
scorned
each
other
discoveries
yes
but
look
here
bjaaland
we
could
see
that
from
where
you
were
standing
there
a
sheer
drop
you
could
see
me
at
all
i
tell
you
i
was
to
the
west
of
the
peak
that
lies
to
the
south
of
the
peak
that
i
gave
up
trying
to
follow
the
discussion
any
longer
the
way
in
which
the
different
parties
had
disappeared
and
come
in
sight
again
gave
me
every
reason
to
decide
in
favour
of
the
route
the
last
arrivals
had
taken
i
thanked
these
keen
gentlemen
for
their
strenuous
ramble
in
the
interests
of
the
expedition
and
went
straight
off
to
sleep
i
dreamed
of
mountains
and
precipices
all
night
and
woke
up
with
bjaaland
whizzing
down
from
the
sky
i
announced
once
more
that
i
had
made
up
my
mind
for
the
other
course
and
went
to
sleep
again
we
debated
next
morning
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
take
the
sledges
two
by
two
to
begin
with
the
glacier
before
us
looked
quite
steep
enough
to
require
double
teams
it
had
a
rise
of
feet
in
quite
a
short
distance
but
we
would
try
first
with
the
single
teams
the
dogs
had
shown
that
their
capabilities
were
far
above
our
expectation
perhaps
they
would
be
able
to
do
even
this
we
crept
off
the
ascent
began
at
once
good
exercise
after
a
quart
of
chocolate
we
did
not
get
on
fast
but
we
won
our
way
it
often
looked
as
if
the
sledge
would
stop
but
a
shout
from
the
driver
and
a
sharp
crack
of
the
whip
kept
the
dogs
on
the
move
it
was
a
fine
beginning
to
the
day
and
we
gave
them
a
rest
when
we
got
up
we
then
drove
in
through
the
narrow
pass
and
out
on
the
other
side
it
was
a
magnificent
panorama
that
opened
before
us
from
the
pass
we
had
come
out
on
to
a
very
small
flat
terrace
which
a
few
yards
farther
on
began
to
drop
steeply
to
a
long
valley
round
about
us
lay
summit
after
summit
on
every
side
we
had
now
come
behind
the
scenes
and
could
get
our
bearings
better
we
now
saw
the
southern
side
of
the
immense
mount
nansen
don
pedro
christophersen
we
could
see
in
his
full
length
between
these
two
mountains
we
could
follow
the
course
of
a
glacier
that
rose
in
terraces
along
their
sides
it
looked
fearfully
broken
and
disturbed
but
we
could
follow
a
little
connected
line
among
the
many
crevasses
we
saw
that
we
could
go
a
long
way
but
we
also
saw
that
the
glacier
forbade
us
to
use
it
in
its
full
extent
between
the
first
and
second
terraces
the
ice
was
evidently
impassable
but
we
could
see
that
there
was
an
unbroken
ledge
up
on
the
side
of
the
mountain
don
pedro
would
help
us
out
on
the
north
along
the
nansen
mountain
there
was
nothing
but
chaos
perfectly
impossible
to
get
through
we
put
up
a
big
beacon
where
we
were
standing
and
took
bearings
from
it
all
round
the
compass
i
went
back
to
the
pass
to
look
out
over
the
barrier
for
the
last
time
the
new
mountain
chain
lay
there
sharp
and
clear
we
could
see
how
it
turned
from
the
east
up
to
and
finally
disappeared
in
the
as
we
judged
about
from
the
look
of
the
sky
it
appeared
that
the
chain
was
continued
farther
according
to
the
aneroid
the
height
of
the
terrace
on
which
we
stood
was
feet
above
the
sea
from
here
there
was
only
one
way
down
and
we
began
to
go
in
making
these
descents
with
loaded
sledges
one
has
to
use
the
greatest
care
lest
the
speed
increase
to
such
a
degree
that
one
loses
command
over
the
sledge
if
this
happens
there
is
a
danger
not
only
of
running
over
the
dogs
but
of
colliding
with
the
sledge
in
front
and
smashing
it
this
was
all
the
more
important
in
our
case
as
the
sledges
carried
we
therefore
put
brakes
of
rope
under
our
runners
when
we
were
to
go
downhill
this
was
done
very
simply
by
taking
a
few
turns
with
a
thin
piece
of
rope
round
each
runner
the
more
of
these
turns
one
took
the
more
powerful
of
course
was
the
brake
the
art
consisted
in
choosing
the
right
number
of
turns
or
the
right
brake
this
was
not
always
attained
and
the
consequence
was
that
before
we
had
come
to
the
end
of
these
descents
there
were
several
collisions
one
of
the
drivers
in
particular
seemed
to
have
a
supreme
contempt
for
a
proper
brake
he
would
rush
down
like
a
flash
of
lightning
and
carry
the
man
in
front
with
him
with
practice
we
avoided
this
but
several
times
things
had
an
ugly
look
the
first
drop
took
us
down
feet
then
we
had
to
cross
a
wide
stiff
piece
of
valley
before
the
ascent
began
again
the
snow
between
the
mountains
was
loose
and
deep
and
gave
the
dogs
hard
work
the
next
ascent
was
up
very
steep
glaciers
the
last
of
which
was
the
steepest
bit
of
climbing
we
had
on
the
whole
journey
stiff
work
even
for
double
teams
going
in
front
of
the
dogs
up
these
slopes
was
i
could
see
a
business
that
bjaaland
would
accomplish
far
more
satisfactorily
than
i
and
i
gave
up
the
place
to
him
the
first
glacier
was
steep
but
the
second
was
like
the
side
of
a
house
it
was
a
pleasure
to
watch
bjaaland
use
his
ski
up
there
one
could
see
that
he
had
been
up
a
hill
before
nor
was
it
less
interesting
to
see
the
dogs
and
the
drivers
go
up
hanssen
drove
one
sledge
alone
wisting
and
hassel
the
other
they
went
by
jerks
foot
by
foot
and
ended
by
reaching
the
top
the
second
relay
went
somewhat
more
easily
in
the
tracks
made
by
the
first
our
height
here
was
feet
the
last
ascent
having
brought
us
up
feet
we
had
arrived
on
a
plateau
and
after
the
dogs
had
rested
we
continued
our
march
now
as
we
advanced
we
had
a
better
view
of
the
way
we
were
going
before
this
the
nearest
mountains
had
shut
us
in
the
mighty
glacier
opened
out
before
us
stretching
as
we
could
now
see
right
up
from
the
barrier
between
the
lofty
mountains
running
east
and
west
it
was
by
this
glacier
that
we
should
have
to
gain
the
plateau
we
could
see
that
we
had
one
more
descent
to
make
before
reaching
it
and
from
above
we
could
distinguish
the
edges
of
some
big
gaps
in
this
descent
and
found
it
prudent
to
examine
it
first
as
we
thought
there
was
a
coming
down
into
it
with
large
ugly
crevasses
in
many
places
but
it
was
not
so
bad
as
to
prevent
our
finally
reaching
with
caution
and
using
good
brakes
the
great
main
axel
heiberg
glacier
the
plan
we
had
proposed
to
ourselves
was
to
work
our
way
up
to
the
place
where
the
glacier
rose
in
abrupt
masses
between
the
two
mountains
the
task
we
had
undertaken
was
greater
than
we
thought
in
the
first
place
the
distance
was
three
times
as
great
as
any
of
us
had
believed
and
in
the
second
place
the
snow
was
so
loose
and
deep
that
it
was
hard
work
for
the
dogs
after
all
their
previous
efforts
we
set
our
course
along
the
white
line
that
we
had
been
able
to
follow
among
the
numerous
crevasses
right
up
to
the
first
terrace
here
tributary
glaciers
came
down
on
all
sides
from
the
mountains
and
joined
the
main
one
it
was
one
of
these
many
small
arms
that
we
reached
that
evening
directly
under
don
pedro
christophersen
the
mountain
below
which
we
had
our
camp
was
covered
with
a
chaos
of
immense
blocks
of
ice
the
glacier
on
which
we
were
was
much
broken
up
but
as
with
all
the
others
the
fissures
were
of
old
date
and
to
a
large
extent
drifted
up
the
snow
was
so
loose
that
we
had
to
trample
a
place
for
the
tent
and
we
could
push
the
right
down
without
meeting
resistance
probably
it
would
be
better
higher
up
in
the
evening
hanssen
and
bjaaland
went
out
to
reconnoitre
and
found
the
conditions
as
we
had
seen
them
from
a
distance
the
way
up
to
the
first
terrace
was
easily
accessible
what
the
conditions
would
be
like
between
this
and
the
second
terrace
we
had
still
to
discover
it
was
stiff
work
next
day
getting
up
to
the
first
terrace
the
arm
of
the
glacier
that
led
up
was
not
very
long
but
extremely
steep
and
full
of
big
crevasses
it
had
to
be
taken
in
relays
two
sledges
at
a
time
the
state
of
the
going
was
fortunately
better
than
on
the
previous
day
and
the
surface
of
the
glacier
was
fine
and
hard
so
that
the
dogs
got
a
splendid
hold
bjaaland
went
in
advance
up
through
this
steep
glacier
and
had
his
work
cut
out
to
keep
ahead
of
the
eager
animals
one
would
never
have
thought
we
were
between
and
the
heat
was
positively
disagreeable
and
although
lightly
clad
we
sweated
as
if
we
were
running
races
in
the
tropics
we
were
ascending
rapidly
but
in
spite
of
the
sudden
change
of
pressure
we
did
not
yet
experience
any
difficulty
of
breathing
headache
or
other
unpleasant
results
that
these
sensations
would
make
their
appearance
in
due
course
was
however
a
matter
of
which
we
could
be
certain
shackleton
description
of
his
march
on
the
plateau
when
headache
of
the
most
violent
and
unpleasant
kind
was
the
order
of
the
day
was
fresh
in
the
memory
of
all
of
us
in
a
comparatively
short
time
we
reached
the
ledge
in
the
glacier
that
we
had
noticed
a
long
way
off
it
was
not
quite
flat
but
sloped
slightly
towards
the
edge
when
we
came
to
the
place
to
which
hanssen
and
bjaaland
had
carried
their
reconnaissance
on
the
previous
evening
we
had
a
very
fine
prospect
of
the
further
course
of
the
glacier
to
continue
along
it
was
an
impossibility
it
consisted
here
between
the
two
vast
mountains
of
nothing
but
crevasse
after
crevasse
so
huge
and
ugly
that
we
were
forced
to
conclude
that
our
further
advance
that
way
was
barred
over
by
fridtjof
nansen
we
could
not
go
this
mountain
here
rose
perpendicularly
in
parts
quite
bare
and
formed
with
the
glacier
a
surface
so
wild
and
cut
up
that
all
thoughts
of
crossing
the
in
that
direction
had
to
be
instantly
abandoned
our
only
chance
lay
in
the
direction
of
don
pedro
christophersen
here
so
far
as
we
could
see
the
connection
of
the
glacier
and
the
land
offered
possibilities
of
further
progress
without
interruption
the
glacier
was
merged
in
the
which
rose
rapidly
towards
the
partially
bare
summit
our
view
however
did
not
extend
very
far
the
first
part
of
the
was
soon
bounded
by
a
lofty
ridge
running
east
and
west
in
which
we
could
see
huge
gaps
here
and
there
from
the
place
where
we
were
standing
we
had
the
impression
that
we
should
be
able
to
continue
our
course
up
there
under
the
ridge
between
these
gaps
and
thus
come
out
beyond
the
disturbed
tract
of
glacier
we
might
possibly
succeed
in
this
but
we
could
not
be
certain
until
we
were
up
on
the
ridge
itself
we
took
a
little
rest
it
was
not
a
long
one
and
then
started
we
were
impatient
to
see
whether
we
could
get
forward
up
above
there
could
be
no
question
of
reaching
the
height
without
double
teams
first
we
had
to
get
hanssen
and
wisting
sledges
up
and
then
the
two
others
we
were
not
particularly
keen
on
thus
covering
the
ground
twice
but
the
conditions
made
it
imperative
we
should
have
been
pleased
just
then
if
we
had
known
that
this
was
to
be
the
last
ascent
that
would
require
double
teams
but
we
did
not
know
this
and
it
was
more
than
any
of
us
dared
to
hope
the
same
hard
work
and
the
same
trouble
to
keep
the
dogs
at
an
even
pace
and
then
we
were
up
under
the
ridge
amongst
the
open
chasms
to
go
farther
without
a
careful
examination
of
the
ground
was
not
to
be
thought
of
doubtless
our
day
march
had
not
been
a
particularly
long
one
but
the
piece
we
had
covered
had
indeed
been
fatiguing
enough
we
therefore
camped
and
set
our
tent
at
an
altitude
of
feet
above
the
sea
we
at
once
proceeded
to
reconnoitre
and
the
first
thing
to
be
examined
was
the
way
we
had
seen
from
below
this
led
in
the
right
direction
that
is
in
the
direction
of
the
glacier
east
and
west
and
was
thus
the
shortest
but
it
is
not
always
the
shortest
way
that
is
the
best
here
in
any
case
it
was
to
be
hoped
that
another
and
longer
one
would
offer
better
conditions
the
shortest
way
was
awful
possibly
not
altogether
impracticable
if
no
better
was
to
be
found
first
we
had
to
work
our
way
across
a
hard
smooth
slope
which
formed
an
angle
of
degrees
and
ended
in
a
huge
bottomless
chasm
it
was
no
great
pleasure
to
cross
over
here
on
ski
but
with
sledges
the
enjoyment
would
be
still
less
the
prospect
of
seeing
sledge
driver
and
dogs
slide
down
sideways
and
disappear
into
the
abyss
was
a
great
one
we
got
across
with
whole
skins
on
ski
and
continued
our
exploration
the
along
which
we
were
advancing
gradually
narrowed
between
vast
fissures
above
and
vaster
fissures
below
and
finally
passed
by
a
very
narrow
bridge
hardly
broader
than
the
sledges
into
the
glacier
on
each
side
of
the
bridge
one
looked
down
into
a
deep
blue
chasm
to
cross
here
did
not
look
very
inviting
no
doubt
we
could
take
the
dogs
out
and
haul
the
sledges
over
and
thus
manage
it
presuming
the
bridge
held
but
our
further
progress
which
would
have
to
be
made
on
the
glacier
would
apparently
offer
many
surprises
of
an
unpleasant
kind
it
was
quite
possible
that
with
time
and
patience
one
would
be
able
to
tack
through
the
apparently
endless
succession
of
deep
crevasses
but
we
should
first
have
to
see
whether
something
better
than
this
could
not
be
found
in
another
direction
we
therefore
returned
to
camp
here
in
the
meantime
everything
had
been
put
in
order
the
tent
set
up
and
the
dogs
fed
now
came
the
great
question
what
was
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
was
it
the
same
desperate
confusion
or
would
the
ground
offer
better
facilities
three
of
us
went
off
to
see
excitement
rose
as
we
neared
the
saddle
so
much
depended
on
finding
a
reasonable
way
one
more
pull
and
we
were
up
it
was
worth
the
trouble
the
first
glance
showed
us
that
this
was
the
way
we
had
to
go
the
ran
smooth
and
even
under
the
lofty
a
gabled
church
tower
of
mount
don
pedro
christophersen
and
followed
the
direction
of
the
glacier
we
could
see
the
place
where
this
long
even
surface
united
with
the
glacier
to
all
appearance
it
was
free
from
disturbance
we
saw
some
crevasses
of
course
but
they
were
far
apart
and
did
not
give
us
the
idea
that
they
would
be
a
hindrance
but
we
were
still
too
far
from
the
spot
to
be
able
to
draw
any
certain
conclusions
as
to
the
character
of
the
ground
we
therefore
set
off
towards
the
bottom
to
examine
the
conditions
more
closely
the
surface
was
loose
up
here
and
the
snow
fairly
deep
our
ski
slipped
over
it
well
but
it
would
be
heavy
for
dogs
we
advanced
rapidly
and
soon
came
to
the
huge
crevasses
they
were
big
enough
and
deep
enough
but
so
scattered
that
without
much
trouble
we
could
find
a
way
between
them
the
hollow
between
the
two
mountains
which
was
filled
by
the
heiberg
glacier
grew
narrower
and
narrower
towards
the
end
and
although
appearances
were
still
very
pleasant
i
expected
to
find
some
disturbance
when
we
arrived
at
the
point
where
the
passed
into
the
glacier
but
my
fears
proved
groundless
by
keeping
right
under
don
pedro
we
went
clear
of
all
trouble
and
in
a
short
time
to
our
great
joy
we
found
ourselves
above
and
beyond
that
chaotic
part
of
the
heiberg
glacier
which
had
completely
barred
our
progress
up
here
all
was
strangely
peaceful
the
and
the
glacier
united
in
a
great
flat
terrace
a
plain
one
might
call
it
without
disturbance
of
any
kind
we
could
see
depressions
in
the
surface
where
the
huge
crevasses
had
formerly
existed
but
now
they
were
entirely
filled
up
and
formed
one
with
the
surrounding
level
we
could
now
see
right
to
the
end
of
this
mighty
glacier
and
form
some
idea
of
its
proportions
mount
wilhelm
christophersen
and
mount
ole
engelstad
formed
the
end
of
it
these
two
summits
entirely
covered
with
snow
towered
high
into
the
sky
we
understood
now
that
the
last
of
the
ascent
was
before
us
and
that
what
we
saw
in
the
distance
between
these
two
mountains
was
the
great
plateau
itself
the
question
then
was
to
find
a
way
up
and
to
conquer
this
last
obstruction
in
the
easiest
manner
in
the
radiantly
clear
air
we
could
see
the
smallest
details
with
our
excellent
prismatic
glasses
and
make
our
calculations
with
great
confidence
it
would
be
possible
to
clamber
up
don
pedro
himself
we
had
done
things
as
difficult
before
but
here
the
side
of
the
mountain
was
fairly
steep
and
full
of
big
crevasses
and
a
fearful
quantity
of
gigantic
blocks
of
ice
between
don
pedro
and
wilhelm
christophersen
an
arm
of
the
glacier
went
up
on
to
the
plateau
but
it
was
so
disturbed
and
broken
up
that
it
could
not
be
used
between
wilhelm
christophersen
and
ole
engelstad
there
was
no
means
of
getting
through
between
ole
engelstad
and
fridtjof
nansen
on
the
other
hand
it
looked
more
promising
but
as
yet
the
first
of
these
mountains
obstructed
our
view
so
much
that
we
could
not
decide
with
certainty
we
were
all
three
rather
tired
but
agreed
to
continue
our
excursion
and
find
out
what
was
here
concealed
our
work
would
make
our
progress
so
much
the
easier
we
therefore
went
on
and
laid
our
course
straight
over
the
topmost
flat
terrace
of
the
heiberg
glacier
as
we
advanced
the
ground
between
nansen
and
engelstad
opened
out
more
and
more
and
without
going
any
farther
we
were
able
to
decide
from
the
formations
that
here
we
should
undoubtedly
find
the
best
way
up
if
the
final
ascent
at
the
end
of
the
glacier
which
was
only
partly
visible
should
present
difficulties
we
could
make
out
from
where
we
stood
that
it
would
be
possible
without
any
great
trouble
to
work
our
way
over
the
upper
end
of
the
nansen
mountain
itself
which
here
passed
into
the
plateau
by
a
not
too
difficult
glacier
yes
now
we
were
certain
that
it
was
indeed
the
great
plateau
and
nothing
else
that
we
saw
before
us
in
the
pass
between
the
two
mountains
and
some
little
distance
within
the
plateau
helland
hansen
showed
up
a
very
curious
peak
to
look
at
it
seemed
to
stick
its
nose
up
through
the
plateau
and
no
more
its
shape
was
long
and
it
reminded
one
of
nothing
so
much
as
the
ridge
of
a
roof
although
this
peak
was
thus
only
just
visible
it
stood
feet
above
the
sea
after
we
had
examined
the
conditions
here
and
found
out
that
on
the
following
day
if
the
weather
permitted
we
should
reach
the
plateau
we
turned
back
well
satisfied
with
the
result
of
our
trip
we
all
agreed
that
we
were
tired
and
longing
to
reach
camp
and
get
some
food
the
place
where
we
turned
was
according
to
the
aneroid
feet
above
the
sea
we
were
therefore
feet
higher
than
our
tent
down
on
the
going
down
in
our
old
tracks
was
easier
work
though
the
return
journey
was
somewhat
monotonous
in
many
places
the
slope
was
rapid
and
not
a
few
fine
runs
were
made
on
approaching
our
we
had
the
sharpest
descent
and
here
reluctant
as
we
might
be
we
found
it
wiser
to
put
both
our
poles
together
and
form
a
strong
brake
we
came
down
smartly
enough
all
the
same
it
was
a
grand
and
imposing
sight
we
had
when
we
came
out
on
the
ridge
under
which
far
below
our
tent
stood
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
huge
crevasses
and
gaping
chasms
it
could
not
be
said
that
the
site
of
our
camp
looked
very
inviting
the
wildness
of
the
landscape
seen
from
this
point
is
not
to
be
described
chasm
after
chasm
crevasse
after
crevasse
with
great
blocks
of
ice
scattered
promiscuously
about
gave
one
the
impression
that
here
nature
was
too
powerful
for
us
here
no
progress
was
to
be
thought
of
it
was
not
without
a
certain
satisfaction
that
we
stood
there
and
contemplated
the
scene
the
little
dark
speck
down
there
our
tent
in
the
midst
of
this
chaos
gave
us
a
feeling
of
strength
and
power
we
knew
in
our
hearts
that
the
ground
would
have
to
be
ugly
indeed
if
we
were
not
to
manoeuvre
our
way
across
it
and
find
a
place
for
that
little
home
of
ours
crash
upon
crash
roar
upon
roar
met
our
ears
now
it
was
a
shot
from
mount
nansen
now
from
one
of
the
others
we
could
see
the
clouds
of
snow
rise
high
into
the
air
it
was
evident
that
these
mountains
were
throwing
off
their
winter
mantles
and
putting
on
a
more
garb
we
came
at
a
tearing
pace
down
to
the
tent
where
our
companions
had
everything
in
most
perfect
order
the
dogs
lay
snoring
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
hardly
condescended
to
move
when
we
came
scudding
in
among
them
inside
the
tent
a
regular
tropical
heat
prevailed
the
sun
was
shining
directly
on
to
the
red
cloth
and
warming
it
the
primus
hummed
and
hissed
and
the
bubbled
and
spurted
we
desired
nothing
better
in
the
world
than
to
get
in
fling
ourselves
down
eat
and
drink
the
news
we
brought
was
no
trifling
matter
the
plateau
it
sounded
almost
too
good
to
be
true
we
had
reckoned
that
it
would
take
us
ten
days
to
get
up
and
now
we
should
do
it
in
four
in
this
way
we
saved
a
great
deal
of
dog
food
as
we
should
be
able
to
slaughter
the
superfluous
animals
six
days
earlier
than
we
had
calculated
it
was
quite
a
little
feast
that
evening
in
the
tent
not
that
we
had
any
more
to
eat
than
usual
we
could
not
allow
ourselves
that
but
the
thought
of
the
fresh
dog
cutlets
that
awaited
us
when
we
got
to
the
top
made
our
mouths
water
in
course
of
time
we
had
so
habituated
ourselves
to
the
idea
of
the
approaching
slaughter
that
this
event
did
not
appear
to
us
so
horrible
as
it
would
otherwise
have
done
judgment
had
already
been
pronounced
and
the
selection
made
of
those
who
were
worthy
of
prolonged
life
and
those
who
were
to
be
sacrificed
this
had
been
i
may
add
a
difficult
problem
to
solve
so
efficient
were
they
all
the
rumblings
continued
all
night
and
one
avalanche
after
another
exposed
parts
of
the
that
had
been
concealed
from
time
immemorial
the
following
day
november
we
were
up
and
away
at
the
usual
time
about
the
weather
was
splendid
calm
and
clear
getting
up
over
the
saddle
was
a
rough
beginning
of
the
day
for
our
dogs
and
they
gave
a
good
account
of
themselves
pulling
the
sledges
up
with
single
teams
this
time
the
going
was
heavy
as
on
the
preceding
day
and
our
advance
through
the
loose
snow
was
not
rapid
we
did
not
follow
our
tracks
of
the
day
before
but
laid
our
course
directly
for
the
place
where
we
had
decided
to
attempt
the
ascent
as
we
approached
mount
ole
engelstad
under
which
we
had
to
pass
in
order
to
come
into
the
arm
of
the
glacier
between
it
and
mount
nansen
our
excitement
began
to
rise
what
does
the
end
look
like
does
the
glacier
go
smoothly
on
into
the
plateau
or
is
it
broken
up
and
impassable
we
rounded
mount
engelstad
more
and
more
wider
and
wider
grew
the
opening
the
surface
looked
extremely
good
as
it
gradually
came
into
view
and
it
did
not
seem
as
though
our
assumption
of
the
previous
day
would
be
put
to
shame
at
last
the
whole
landscape
opened
out
and
without
obstruction
of
any
kind
whatever
the
last
part
of
the
ascent
lay
before
us
it
was
both
long
and
steep
from
the
look
of
it
and
we
agreed
to
take
a
little
rest
before
beginning
the
final
attack
we
stopped
right
under
mount
engelstad
in
a
warm
and
sunny
place
and
allowed
ourselves
on
this
occasion
a
little
lunch
an
indulgence
that
had
not
hitherto
been
permitted
the
was
taken
out
and
soon
the
primus
was
humming
in
a
way
that
told
us
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
chocolate
was
ready
it
was
a
heavenly
treat
that
drink
we
had
all
walked
ourselves
warm
and
our
throats
were
as
dry
as
tinder
the
contents
of
the
pot
were
served
round
by
the
cook
hanssen
it
was
no
use
asking
him
to
share
alike
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
take
more
than
half
of
what
was
due
to
him
the
rest
he
had
to
divide
among
his
comrades
the
drink
he
had
prepared
this
time
was
what
he
called
chocolate
but
i
had
some
difficulty
in
believing
him
he
was
economical
was
hanssen
and
permitted
no
extravagance
that
could
be
seen
very
well
by
his
chocolate
well
after
all
to
people
who
were
accustomed
to
regard
bread
and
water
as
a
luxury
it
tasted
as
i
have
said
heavenly
it
was
the
liquid
part
of
the
lunch
that
was
served
extra
if
anyone
wanted
something
to
eat
he
had
to
provide
it
himself
nothing
was
offered
him
happy
was
he
who
had
saved
some
biscuits
from
his
breakfast
our
halt
was
not
a
very
long
one
it
is
a
queer
thing
that
when
one
only
has
on
light
underclothing
and
windproof
overalls
one
can
not
stand
still
for
long
without
feeling
cold
although
the
temperature
was
no
lower
than
we
were
glad
to
be
on
the
move
again
the
last
ascent
was
fairly
hard
work
especially
the
first
half
of
it
we
never
expected
to
do
it
with
single
teams
but
tried
it
all
the
same
for
this
last
pull
up
i
must
give
the
highest
praise
both
to
the
dogs
and
their
drivers
it
was
a
brilliant
performance
on
both
sides
i
can
still
see
the
situation
clearly
before
me
the
dogs
seemed
positively
to
understand
that
this
was
the
last
big
effort
that
was
asked
of
them
they
lay
flat
down
and
hauled
dug
their
claws
in
and
dragged
themselves
forward
but
they
had
to
stop
and
get
breath
pretty
often
and
then
the
driver
strength
was
put
to
the
test
it
is
no
play
to
set
a
sledge
in
motion
time
after
time
how
they
toiled
men
and
beasts
up
that
slope
but
they
got
on
inch
by
inch
until
the
steepest
part
was
behind
them
before
them
lay
the
rest
of
the
ascent
in
a
gentle
rise
up
which
they
could
drive
without
a
stop
it
was
stiff
nevertheless
and
it
took
a
long
time
before
we
were
all
up
on
the
plateau
on
the
southern
side
of
mount
engelstad
we
were
very
curious
and
anxious
to
see
what
the
plateau
looked
like
we
had
expected
a
great
level
plain
extending
boundlessly
towards
the
south
but
in
this
we
were
disappointed
towards
the
it
looked
very
level
and
fine
but
that
was
not
the
way
we
had
to
go
towards
the
south
the
ground
continued
to
rise
in
long
ridges
running
east
and
west
probably
a
continuation
of
the
mountain
chain
running
to
the
or
a
connection
between
it
and
the
plateau
we
stubbornly
continued
our
march
we
would
not
give
in
until
we
had
the
plain
itself
before
us
our
hope
was
that
the
ridge
projecting
from
mount
don
pedro
christophersen
would
be
the
last
we
now
had
it
before
us
the
going
changed
at
once
up
here
the
loose
snow
disappeared
and
a
few
sastrugi
began
to
show
themselves
these
were
specially
unpleasant
to
deal
with
on
this
last
ridge
they
lay
from
to
and
were
as
hard
as
flints
and
as
sharp
as
knives
a
fall
among
them
might
have
had
very
serious
consequences
one
would
have
thought
the
dogs
had
had
enough
work
that
day
to
tire
them
but
this
last
ridge
with
its
unpleasant
did
not
seem
to
trouble
them
in
the
least
we
all
drove
up
gaily
towed
by
the
sledges
on
to
what
looked
to
us
like
the
final
plateau
and
halted
at
the
weather
had
held
fine
and
we
could
apparently
see
a
very
long
way
in
the
far
distance
extending
to
the
rose
peak
after
peak
this
was
the
chain
of
mountains
running
to
the
which
we
now
saw
from
the
other
side
in
our
own
vicinity
on
the
other
band
we
saw
nothing
but
the
backs
of
the
mountains
so
frequently
mentioned
we
afterwards
learned
how
deceptive
the
light
can
be
i
consulted
the
aneroid
immediately
on
our
arrival
at
the
and
it
showed
feet
above
the
sea
which
the
hypsometer
afterwards
confirmed
all
the
gave
seventeen
geographical
miles
or
kilometres
nineteen
and
a
quarter
statute
miles
this
day
work
nineteen
and
a
quarter
miles
with
an
ascent
of
feet
gives
us
some
idea
of
what
can
be
performed
by
dogs
in
good
training
our
sledges
still
had
what
might
be
considered
heavy
loads
it
seems
superfluous
to
give
the
animals
any
other
testimonial
than
the
bare
fact
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
place
for
the
tent
so
hard
was
the
snow
up
here
we
found
one
however
and
set
the
tent
and
were
handed
in
to
me
as
usual
through
the
and
i
arranged
everything
inside
the
and
the
necessary
provisions
for
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
were
also
passed
in
but
the
part
of
my
work
that
went
more
quickly
than
usual
that
night
was
getting
the
primus
started
and
pumping
it
up
to
i
was
hoping
thereby
to
produce
enough
noise
to
deaden
the
shots
that
i
knew
would
soon
be
heard
of
our
brave
companions
and
faithful
helpers
were
marked
out
for
death
it
was
hard
but
it
had
to
be
so
we
had
agreed
to
shrink
from
nothing
in
order
to
reach
our
goal
each
man
was
to
kill
his
own
dogs
to
the
number
that
had
been
fixed
the
pemmican
was
cooked
remarkably
quickly
that
evening
and
i
believe
i
was
unusually
industrious
in
stirring
it
there
went
the
first
shot
i
am
not
a
nervous
man
but
i
must
admit
that
i
gave
a
start
shot
now
followed
upon
shot
they
had
an
uncanny
sound
over
the
great
plain
a
trusty
servant
lost
his
life
each
time
it
was
long
before
the
first
man
reported
that
he
had
finished
they
were
all
to
open
their
dogs
and
take
out
the
entrails
to
prevent
the
meat
being
contaminated
the
entrails
were
for
the
most
part
devoured
warm
on
the
spot
by
the
victims
comrades
so
voracious
were
they
all
suggen
one
of
wisting
dogs
was
especially
eager
for
warm
entrails
after
enjoying
this
luxury
he
could
be
seen
staggering
about
in
a
quite
misshapen
condition
many
of
the
dogs
would
not
touch
them
at
first
but
their
appetite
came
after
a
while
the
holiday
humour
that
ought
to
have
prevailed
in
the
tent
that
evening
our
first
on
the
plateau
did
not
make
its
appearance
there
was
depression
and
sadness
in
the
air
we
had
grown
so
fond
of
our
dogs
the
place
was
named
the
butcher
shop
it
had
been
arranged
that
we
should
stop
here
two
days
to
rest
and
eat
dog
there
was
more
than
one
among
us
who
at
first
would
not
hear
of
taking
any
part
in
this
feast
but
as
time
went
by
and
appetites
became
sharper
this
view
underwent
a
change
until
during
the
last
few
days
before
reaching
the
butcher
shop
we
all
thought
and
talked
of
nothing
but
dog
cutlets
dog
steaks
and
the
like
but
on
this
first
evening
we
put
a
restraint
on
ourselves
we
thought
we
could
not
fall
upon
our
friends
and
devour
them
before
they
had
had
time
to
grow
cold
we
quickly
found
out
that
the
butcher
shop
was
not
a
hospitable
locality
during
the
night
the
temperature
sank
and
violent
gusts
of
wind
swept
over
the
plain
they
shook
and
tore
at
the
tent
but
it
would
take
more
than
that
to
get
a
hold
of
it
the
dogs
spent
the
night
in
eating
we
could
hear
the
crunching
and
grinding
of
their
teeth
whenever
we
were
awake
for
a
moment
the
effect
of
the
great
and
sudden
change
of
altitude
made
itself
felt
at
once
when
i
wanted
to
turn
round
in
my
bag
i
had
to
do
it
a
bit
at
a
time
so
as
not
to
get
out
of
breath
that
my
comrades
were
affected
in
the
same
way
i
knew
without
asking
them
my
ears
told
me
enough
it
was
calm
when
we
turned
out
but
the
weather
did
not
look
altogether
promising
it
was
overcast
and
threatening
we
occupied
the
forenoon
in
flaying
a
number
of
dogs
as
i
have
said
all
the
survivors
were
not
yet
in
a
mood
for
dog
flesh
and
it
therefore
had
to
be
served
in
the
most
enticing
form
when
flayed
and
cut
up
it
went
down
readily
all
along
the
line
even
the
most
fastidious
then
overcame
their
scruples
but
with
the
skin
on
we
should
not
have
been
able
to
persuade
them
all
to
eat
that
morning
probably
this
distaste
was
due
to
the
smell
clinging
to
the
skins
and
i
must
admit
that
it
was
not
appetizing
the
meat
itself
as
it
lay
there
cut
up
looked
well
enough
in
all
conscience
no
butcher
shop
could
have
exhibited
a
finer
sight
than
we
showed
after
flaying
and
cutting
up
ten
dogs
great
masses
of
beautiful
fresh
red
meat
with
quantities
of
the
most
tempting
fat
lay
spread
over
the
snow
the
dogs
went
round
and
sniffed
at
it
some
helped
themselves
to
a
piece
others
were
digesting
we
men
had
picked
out
what
we
thought
was
the
youngest
and
tenderest
one
for
ourselves
the
whole
arrangement
was
left
to
wisting
both
the
selection
and
the
preparation
of
the
cutlets
his
choice
fell
upon
rex
a
beautiful
little
animal
one
of
his
own
dogs
by
the
way
with
the
skill
of
an
expert
he
hacked
and
cut
away
what
he
considered
would
be
sufficient
for
a
meal
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
his
work
the
delicate
little
cutlets
had
an
absolutely
hypnotizing
effect
as
they
were
spread
out
one
by
one
over
the
snow
they
recalled
memories
of
old
days
when
no
doubt
a
dog
cutlet
would
have
been
less
tempting
than
now
memories
of
dishes
on
which
the
cutlets
were
elegantly
arranged
side
by
side
with
paper
frills
on
the
bones
and
a
neat
pile
of
petits
pois
in
the
middle
ah
my
thoughts
wandered
still
farther
afield
but
that
does
not
concern
us
now
nor
has
it
anything
to
do
with
the
south
pole
i
was
aroused
from
my
musings
by
wisting
digging
his
axe
into
the
snow
as
a
sign
that
his
work
was
done
after
which
he
picked
up
the
cutlets
and
went
into
the
tent
the
clouds
had
dispersed
somewhat
and
from
time
to
time
the
sun
appeared
though
not
in
its
most
genial
aspect
we
succeeded
in
catching
it
just
in
time
to
get
our
latitude
determined
we
were
lucky
as
not
long
after
the
wind
got
up
from
the
and
before
we
knew
what
was
happening
everything
was
in
a
cloud
of
snow
but
now
we
snapped
our
fingers
at
the
weather
what
difference
did
it
make
to
us
if
the
wind
howled
in
the
and
the
snow
drifted
we
had
in
any
case
made
up
our
minds
to
stay
here
for
a
while
and
we
had
food
in
abundance
we
knew
the
dogs
thought
much
the
same
so
long
as
we
have
enough
to
eat
let
the
weather
go
hang
inside
the
tent
wisting
was
getting
on
well
when
we
came
in
after
making
these
observations
the
pot
was
on
and
to
judge
by
the
savoury
smell
the
preparations
were
already
far
advanced
the
cutlets
were
not
fried
we
had
neither
nor
butter
we
could
no
doubt
have
got
some
lard
out
of
the
pemmican
and
we
might
have
contrived
some
sort
of
a
pan
so
that
we
could
have
fried
them
if
it
had
been
necessary
but
we
found
it
far
easier
and
quicker
to
boil
them
and
in
this
way
we
got
excellent
soup
into
the
bargain
wisting
knew
his
business
surprisingly
well
he
had
put
into
the
soup
all
those
parts
of
the
pemmican
that
contained
most
vegetables
and
now
he
served
us
the
finest
fresh
meat
soup
with
vegetables
in
it
the
clou
of
the
repast
was
the
dish
of
cutlets
if
we
had
entertained
the
slightest
doubt
of
the
quality
of
the
meat
this
vanished
instantly
on
the
first
trial
the
meat
was
excellent
quite
excellent
and
one
cutlet
after
another
disappeared
with
rapidity
i
must
admit
that
they
would
have
lost
nothing
by
being
a
little
more
tender
but
one
must
not
expect
too
much
of
a
dog
at
this
first
meal
i
finished
five
cutlets
myself
and
looked
in
vain
in
the
pot
for
more
wisting
appeared
not
to
have
reckoned
on
such
a
brisk
demand
we
employed
the
afternoon
in
going
through
our
stock
of
provisions
and
dividing
the
whole
of
it
among
three
sledges
the
fourth
hassel
was
to
be
left
behind
the
provisions
were
thus
divided
sledge
wisting
contained
biscuits
daily
ration
biscuits
per
man
dogs
pemmican
pounds
kilogram
or
pound
ounces
per
dog
per
day
men
pemmican
pounds
grams
or
ounces
per
man
per
day
chocolate
pounds
grams
or
ounces
per
man
per
day
pounds
grams
or
ounces
per
man
per
day
the
other
two
sledges
had
approximately
the
same
supplies
and
thus
permitted
us
on
leaving
this
place
to
extend
our
march
over
a
period
of
sixty
days
with
full
rations
our
eighteen
surviving
dogs
were
divided
into
three
teams
six
in
each
according
to
our
calculation
we
ought
to
be
able
to
reach
the
pole
from
here
with
these
eighteen
and
to
leave
it
again
with
sixteen
hassel
who
was
to
leave
his
sledge
at
this
point
thus
concluded
his
provision
account
and
the
divided
provisions
were
entered
in
the
books
of
the
three
others
all
this
then
was
done
that
day
on
paper
it
remained
to
make
the
actual
transfer
of
provisions
later
when
the
weather
permitted
to
go
out
and
do
it
that
afternoon
was
not
advisable
next
day
november
the
wind
had
gone
round
to
the
with
comparatively
manageable
weather
so
at
seven
in
the
morning
we
began
to
repack
the
sledges
this
was
not
an
altogether
pleasant
task
although
the
weather
was
what
i
have
called
comparatively
manageable
it
was
very
far
from
being
suitable
for
packing
provisions
the
chocolate
which
by
this
time
consisted
chiefly
of
very
small
pieces
had
to
be
taken
out
counted
and
then
divided
among
the
three
sledges
the
same
with
the
biscuits
every
single
biscuit
had
to
be
taken
out
and
counted
and
as
we
had
some
thousands
of
them
to
deal
with
it
will
readily
be
understood
what
it
was
to
stand
there
in
about
and
a
gale
of
wind
most
of
the
time
with
bare
hands
fumbling
over
this
troublesome
occupation
the
wind
increased
while
we
were
at
work
and
when
at
last
we
had
finished
the
snow
was
so
thick
that
we
could
scarcely
see
the
tent
our
original
intention
of
starting
again
as
soon
as
the
sledges
were
ready
was
abandoned
we
did
not
lose
very
much
by
this
on
the
contrary
we
gained
on
the
whole
the
dogs
the
most
important
factor
of
all
had
a
thorough
rest
and
were
well
fed
they
had
undergone
a
remarkable
change
since
our
arrival
at
the
butcher
shop
they
now
wandered
about
fat
sleek
and
contented
and
their
former
voracity
had
completely
disappeared
as
regards
ourselves
a
day
or
two
longer
made
no
difference
our
most
important
article
of
diet
the
pemmican
was
practically
left
untouched
as
for
the
time
being
dog
had
completely
taken
its
place
there
was
thus
no
great
sign
of
depression
to
be
noticed
when
we
came
back
into
the
tent
after
finishing
our
work
and
had
to
while
away
the
time
as
i
went
in
i
could
descry
wisting
a
little
way
off
kneeling
on
the
ground
and
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
cutlets
the
dogs
stood
in
a
ring
round
him
and
looked
on
with
interest
the
wind
whistled
and
howled
the
air
was
thick
with
driving
snow
and
wisting
was
not
to
be
envied
but
he
managed
his
work
well
and
we
got
our
dinner
as
usual
during
the
evening
the
wind
moderated
a
little
and
went
more
to
the
east
we
went
to
sleep
with
the
best
hopes
for
the
following
day
saturday
november
came
it
was
a
grand
day
in
many
respects
i
had
already
seen
proofs
on
several
occasions
of
the
kind
of
men
my
comrades
were
but
their
conduct
that
day
was
such
that
i
shall
never
forget
it
to
whatever
age
i
may
live
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
wind
had
gone
back
to
the
north
and
increased
to
a
gale
it
was
blowing
and
snowing
so
that
when
we
came
out
in
the
morning
we
could
not
see
the
sledges
they
were
half
snowed
under
the
dogs
had
all
crept
together
and
protected
themselves
as
well
as
they
could
against
the
blizzard
the
temperature
was
not
so
very
low
but
low
enough
to
be
disagreeably
felt
in
a
storm
we
had
all
taken
a
turn
outside
to
look
at
the
weather
and
were
sitting
on
our
discussing
the
poor
prospect
it
the
devil
own
weather
here
at
the
butcher
said
one
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
would
never
get
any
better
this
is
the
fifth
day
and
it
blowing
worse
than
ever
we
all
agreed
there
nothing
so
bad
as
lying
like
this
continued
another
it
takes
more
out
of
you
than
going
from
morning
to
night
personally
i
was
of
the
same
opinion
one
day
may
be
pleasant
enough
but
two
three
four
and
as
it
now
seemed
five
days
no
it
was
awful
shall
we
try
it
no
sooner
was
the
proposal
submitted
than
it
was
accepted
unanimously
and
with
acclamation
when
i
think
of
my
four
friends
of
the
southern
journey
it
is
the
memory
of
that
morning
that
comes
first
to
my
mind
all
the
qualities
that
i
most
admire
in
a
man
were
clearly
shown
at
that
juncture
courage
and
dauntlessness
without
boasting
or
big
words
amid
joking
and
chaff
everything
was
packed
and
then
out
into
the
blizzard
it
was
practically
impossible
to
keep
one
eyes
open
the
fine
penetrated
everywhere
and
at
times
one
had
a
feeling
of
being
blind
the
tent
was
not
only
drifted
up
but
covered
with
ice
and
in
taking
it
down
we
had
to
handle
it
with
care
so
as
not
to
break
it
in
pieces
the
dogs
were
not
much
inclined
to
start
and
it
took
time
to
get
them
into
their
harness
but
at
last
we
were
ready
one
more
glance
over
the
to
see
that
nothing
we
ought
to
have
with
us
had
been
forgotten
the
fourteen
dogs
carcasses
that
were
left
were
piled
up
in
a
heap
and
hassel
sledge
was
set
up
against
it
as
a
mark
the
spare
sets
of
some
alpine
ropes
and
all
our
crampons
for
which
we
now
thought
would
not
be
required
were
left
behind
the
last
thing
to
be
done
was
planting
a
broken
ski
upright
by
the
side
of
the
depot
it
was
wisting
who
did
this
thinking
presumably
that
an
extra
mark
would
do
no
harm
that
it
was
a
happy
thought
the
future
will
show
and
then
we
were
off
it
was
a
hard
pull
to
begin
with
both
for
men
and
beasts
as
the
high
sastrugi
continued
towards
the
south
and
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
advance
those
who
had
sledges
to
drive
had
to
be
very
attentive
and
support
them
so
that
they
did
not
capsize
on
the
big
waves
and
we
who
had
no
sledges
found
great
difficulty
in
keeping
our
feet
as
we
had
nothing
to
lean
against
we
went
on
like
this
slowly
enough
but
the
main
thing
was
that
we
made
progress
the
ground
at
first
gave
one
the
impression
of
rising
though
not
much
the
going
was
extremely
heavy
it
was
like
dragging
oneself
through
sand
meanwhile
the
sastrugi
grew
smaller
and
smaller
and
finally
they
disappeared
altogether
and
the
surface
became
quite
flat
the
going
also
improved
by
degrees
for
what
reason
it
is
difficult
to
say
as
the
storm
continued
unabated
and
the
drift
now
combined
with
falling
snow
was
thicker
than
ever
it
was
all
the
driver
could
do
to
see
his
own
dogs
the
surface
which
had
become
perfectly
level
had
the
appearance
at
times
of
sinking
in
any
case
one
would
have
thought
so
from
the
pace
of
the
sledges
now
and
again
the
dogs
would
set
off
suddenly
at
a
gallop
the
wind
aft
no
doubt
helped
the
pace
somewhat
but
it
alone
could
not
account
for
the
change
i
did
not
like
this
tendency
of
the
ground
to
fall
away
in
my
opinion
we
ought
to
have
done
with
anything
of
that
sort
after
reaching
the
height
at
which
we
were
a
slight
slope
upward
possibly
but
down
no
that
did
not
agree
with
my
reckoning
so
far
the
incline
had
not
been
so
great
as
to
cause
uneasiness
but
if
it
seriously
began
to
go
downhill
we
should
have
to
stop
and
camp
to
run
down
at
full
gallop
blindly
and
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
ground
would
be
madness
we
might
risk
falling
into
some
chasm
before
we
had
time
to
pull
up
hanssen
as
usual
was
driving
first
strictly
speaking
i
should
now
have
been
going
in
advance
but
the
uneven
surface
at
the
start
and
the
rapid
pace
afterwards
had
made
it
impossible
to
walk
as
fast
the
dogs
could
pull
i
was
therefore
following
by
the
side
of
wisting
sledge
and
chatting
with
him
suddenly
i
saw
hanssen
dogs
shoot
ahead
and
downhill
they
went
at
the
wildest
pace
wisting
after
them
i
shouted
to
hanssen
to
stop
and
he
succeeded
in
doing
so
by
twisting
his
sledge
the
others
who
were
following
stopped
when
they
came
up
to
him
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
fairly
steep
descent
what
there
might
be
below
was
not
easy
to
decide
nor
would
we
try
to
find
out
in
that
weather
was
it
possible
that
we
were
on
our
way
down
through
the
mountains
again
it
seemed
more
probable
that
we
lay
on
one
of
the
numerous
ridges
but
we
could
be
sure
of
nothing
before
the
weather
cleared
we
trampled
down
a
place
for
the
tent
in
the
loose
snow
and
soon
got
it
up
it
was
not
a
long
day
march
that
we
had
done
eleven
and
miles
but
we
had
put
an
end
to
our
stay
at
the
butcher
shop
and
that
was
a
great
thing
the
test
that
evening
showed
that
we
were
feet
above
the
sea
and
that
we
had
thus
gone
down
feet
from
the
butcher
we
turned
in
and
went
to
sleep
as
soon
as
it
brightened
we
should
have
to
be
ready
to
jump
out
and
look
at
the
weather
one
has
to
seize
every
opportunity
in
these
regions
if
one
neglects
to
do
so
it
may
mean
a
long
wait
and
much
may
be
lost
we
therefore
all
slept
with
one
eye
open
and
we
knew
well
that
nothing
could
happen
without
our
noticing
it
at
three
in
the
morning
the
sun
cut
through
the
clouds
and
we
through
the
to
take
in
the
situation
was
more
than
the
work
of
a
moment
the
sun
showed
as
yet
like
a
pat
of
butter
and
had
not
succeeded
in
dispersing
the
thick
mists
the
wind
had
dropped
somewhat
but
was
still
fairly
strong
this
is
after
all
the
worst
part
of
one
job
turning
out
of
one
good
warm
and
standing
outside
for
some
time
in
thin
clothes
watching
the
weather
we
knew
by
experience
that
a
gleam
like
this
a
clearing
in
the
weather
might
come
suddenly
and
then
one
had
to
be
on
the
spot
the
gleam
came
it
did
not
last
long
but
long
enough
we
lay
on
the
side
of
a
ridge
that
fell
away
pretty
steeply
the
descent
on
the
south
was
too
abrupt
but
on
the
it
was
better
and
more
gradual
and
ended
in
a
wide
level
tract
we
could
see
no
crevasses
or
unpleasantness
of
any
kind
it
was
not
very
far
that
we
could
see
though
only
our
nearest
surroundings
of
the
mountains
we
saw
nothing
neither
fridtjof
nansen
nor
don
pedro
christophersen
well
content
with
our
morning
work
we
turned
in
again
and
slept
till
when
we
began
our
morning
preparations
the
weather
which
had
somewhat
improved
during
the
night
had
now
broken
loose
again
and
the
was
doing
all
it
could
however
it
would
take
more
than
storm
and
snow
to
stop
us
now
since
we
had
discovered
the
nature
of
our
immediate
surroundings
if
we
once
got
down
to
the
plain
we
knew
that
we
could
always
feel
our
way
on
after
putting
ample
brakes
on
the
we
started
off
downhill
in
a
direction
the
slight
idea
of
the
position
that
we
had
been
able
to
get
in
the
morning
proved
correct
the
descent
was
easy
and
smooth
and
we
reached
the
plain
without
any
adventure
we
could
now
once
more
set
our
faces
to
the
south
and
in
thick
driving
snow
we
continued
our
way
into
the
unknown
with
good
assistance
from
the
howling
gale
we
now
recommenced
the
erection
of
beacons
which
had
not
been
necessary
during
the
ascent
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
we
again
passed
over
a
little
ridge
the
last
of
them
that
we
encountered
the
surface
was
now
fine
enough
smooth
as
a
floor
and
without
a
sign
of
sastrugi
if
our
progress
was
nevertheless
slow
and
difficult
this
was
due
to
the
wretched
going
which
was
real
torture
to
all
of
us
a
sledge
journey
through
the
sahara
could
not
have
offered
a
worse
surface
to
move
over
now
the
forerunners
came
into
their
own
and
from
here
to
the
pole
hassel
and
i
took
it
in
turns
to
occupy
the
position
the
weather
improved
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
when
we
camped
in
the
afternoon
it
looked
quite
smiling
the
sun
came
through
and
gave
a
delightful
warmth
after
the
last
few
bitter
days
it
was
not
yet
clear
so
that
we
could
see
nothing
of
our
surroundings
the
distance
according
to
our
three
was
eighteen
and
a
half
miles
taking
the
bad
going
into
consideration
we
had
reason
to
be
well
satisfied
with
it
our
altitude
came
out
at
feet
above
the
sea
or
a
drop
of
feet
in
the
course
of
the
day
this
surprised
me
greatly
what
did
it
mean
instead
of
rising
gradually
we
were
going
slowly
down
something
extraordinary
must
await
us
farther
on
but
what
according
to
dead
reckoning
our
latitude
that
evening
was
november
did
not
bring
us
the
desired
weather
the
night
was
filled
with
sharp
gusts
from
the
north
the
morning
came
with
a
slack
wind
but
accompanied
by
mist
and
snowfall
this
was
abominable
here
we
were
advancing
over
absolutely
virgin
ground
and
able
to
see
nothing
the
surface
remained
about
the
same
possibly
rather
more
undulating
that
it
had
been
blowing
here
at
some
time
and
violently
too
was
shown
by
the
which
was
composed
of
sastrugi
as
hard
as
iron
luckily
for
us
the
snowfall
of
the
last
few
days
had
filled
these
up
so
as
to
present
a
level
surface
it
was
heavy
going
though
better
than
on
the
previous
day
as
we
were
advancing
still
blindly
and
fretting
at
the
persistently
thick
weather
one
of
us
suddenly
called
out
hullo
look
there
a
wild
dark
summit
rose
high
out
of
the
mass
of
fog
to
the
it
was
not
far
away
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
threateningly
near
and
right
over
us
we
stopped
and
looked
at
the
imposing
sight
but
nature
did
not
expose
her
objects
of
interest
for
long
the
fog
rolled
over
again
thick
heavy
and
dark
and
blotted
out
the
view
we
knew
now
that
we
had
to
be
prepared
for
surprises
after
we
had
gone
about
ten
miles
the
fog
again
lifted
for
a
moment
and
we
saw
quite
near
a
mile
or
so
away
two
long
narrow
mountain
ridges
to
the
west
of
us
running
north
and
south
and
completely
covered
with
snow
these
helland
hansen
mountains
were
the
only
ones
we
saw
on
our
right
hand
during
the
march
on
the
plateau
they
were
between
and
feet
high
and
would
probably
serve
as
excellent
landmarks
on
the
return
journey
there
was
no
connection
to
be
traced
between
these
mountains
and
those
lying
to
the
east
of
them
they
gave
us
the
impression
of
being
entirely
isolated
summits
as
we
could
not
make
out
any
lofty
ridge
running
east
and
west
we
continued
our
course
in
the
constant
expectation
of
finding
some
surprise
or
other
in
our
line
of
route
the
air
ahead
of
us
was
as
black
as
pitch
as
though
it
concealed
something
it
could
not
be
a
storm
or
it
would
have
been
already
upon
us
but
we
went
on
and
on
and
nothing
came
our
day
march
was
eighteen
and
a
half
miles
i
see
that
my
diary
for
november
does
not
begin
very
promisingly
fog
fog
and
again
fog
also
fine
falling
snow
which
makes
the
going
impossible
poor
beasts
they
have
toiled
hard
to
get
the
sledges
forward
but
the
day
did
not
turn
out
so
badly
after
all
as
we
worked
our
way
out
of
this
uncertainty
and
found
out
what
was
behind
the
clouds
during
the
forenoon
the
sun
came
through
and
thrust
aside
the
fog
for
a
while
and
there
to
the
not
many
miles
away
lay
an
immense
mountain
mass
from
this
mass
right
across
our
course
ran
a
great
ancient
glacier
the
sun
shone
down
upon
it
and
showed
us
a
surface
full
of
huge
irregularities
on
the
side
nearest
to
the
mountain
these
disturbances
were
such
that
a
hasty
glance
was
enough
to
show
us
the
impossibility
of
advancing
that
way
but
right
in
our
line
of
route
straight
on
to
the
glacier
it
looked
as
far
as
we
could
see
as
though
we
could
get
along
the
fog
came
and
went
and
we
had
to
take
advantage
of
the
clear
intervals
to
get
our
bearings
it
would
no
doubt
have
been
better
if
we
could
have
halted
set
up
our
tent
and
waited
for
decently
clear
weather
so
that
we
might
survey
the
ground
at
our
ease
and
choose
the
best
way
going
forward
without
an
idea
of
what
the
ground
was
like
was
not
very
pleasant
but
how
long
should
we
have
to
wait
for
clear
weather
that
question
was
unanswerable
possibly
a
week
or
even
a
fortnight
and
we
had
no
time
for
that
better
go
straight
on
then
and
take
what
might
come
what
we
could
see
of
the
glacier
appeared
to
be
pretty
steep
but
it
was
only
between
the
south
and
under
the
new
land
that
the
fog
now
and
again
lifted
sufficiently
to
enable
us
to
see
anything
from
the
south
round
to
the
west
the
fog
lay
as
thick
as
gruel
we
could
see
that
the
big
crevasses
lost
themselves
in
it
and
the
question
of
what
the
glacier
looked
like
on
the
west
had
to
be
put
aside
for
the
moment
it
was
to
the
south
we
had
to
go
and
there
it
was
possible
to
go
forward
a
little
way
we
continued
our
march
until
the
ground
began
to
show
signs
of
the
glacier
in
the
form
of
small
crevasses
and
then
we
halted
it
was
our
intention
to
lighten
our
sledges
before
tackling
the
glacier
from
the
little
we
could
see
of
it
it
was
plain
enough
that
we
should
have
stiff
work
it
was
therefore
important
to
have
as
little
as
possible
on
the
sledges
we
set
to
work
at
once
to
build
the
depot
the
snow
here
was
excellent
for
this
purpose
as
hard
as
glass
in
a
short
time
an
immense
erection
of
adamantine
blocks
of
snow
rose
into
the
air
containing
provisions
for
five
men
for
six
days
and
for
eighteen
dogs
for
five
days
a
number
of
small
articles
were
also
left
behind
while
we
were
thus
occupied
the
fog
had
been
coming
and
going
some
of
the
intervals
had
been
quite
clear
and
had
given
me
a
good
view
of
the
nearest
part
of
the
range
it
appeared
to
be
quite
isolated
and
to
consist
of
four
mountains
one
of
these
mount
helmer
hanssen
lay
separated
from
the
rest
the
other
three
mounts
oscar
wisting
sverre
hassel
and
olav
bjaaland
lay
closer
together
behind
this
group
the
air
had
been
heavy
and
black
the
whole
time
showing
that
more
land
must
be
concealed
there
suddenly
in
one
of
the
brightest
intervals
there
came
a
rift
in
this
curtain
and
the
summits
of
a
colossal
mountain
mass
appeared
our
first
impression
was
that
this
mountain
mount
thorvald
nilsen
must
be
something
over
feet
high
it
positively
took
our
breath
away
so
formidable
did
it
appear
but
it
was
only
a
glimpse
that
we
had
and
then
the
fog
enclosed
it
once
more
we
had
succeeded
in
taking
a
few
meagre
bearings
of
the
different
summits
of
the
nearest
group
they
were
not
very
grand
but
better
ones
were
not
to
be
obtained
for
that
matter
the
site
of
the
depot
was
so
well
marked
by
its
position
under
the
foot
of
the
glacier
that
we
agreed
it
would
be
impossible
to
miss
it
having
finished
the
edifice
which
rose
at
least
feet
into
the
air
we
put
one
of
our
black
provision
cases
on
the
top
of
it
so
as
to
be
able
to
see
it
still
more
easily
on
the
way
back
an
observation
we
had
contrived
to
take
while
the
work
was
in
progress
gave
us
our
latitude
as
this
did
not
agree
very
well
with
the
latitude
of
our
dead
reckoning
meanwhile
the
fog
had
again
enveloped
everything
and
a
fine
light
snow
was
falling
we
had
taken
a
bearing
of
the
line
of
glacier
that
was
most
free
of
crevasses
and
so
we
moved
on
again
it
was
some
time
before
we
felt
our
way
up
to
the
glacier
the
crevasses
at
its
foot
were
not
large
but
we
had
no
sooner
entered
upon
the
ascent
than
the
fun
began
there
was
something
uncanny
about
this
perfectly
blind
advance
among
crevasses
and
chasms
on
all
sides
we
examined
the
compass
from
time
to
time
and
went
forward
cautiously
hassel
and
i
went
in
front
on
a
rope
but
that
after
all
was
not
much
of
a
help
to
our
drivers
we
naturally
glided
lightly
on
our
ski
over
places
where
the
dogs
would
easily
fall
through
this
lowest
part
of
the
glacier
was
not
entirely
free
from
danger
as
the
crevasses
were
often
rendered
quite
invisible
by
a
thin
overlying
layer
of
snow
in
clear
weather
it
is
not
so
bad
to
have
to
cross
such
a
surface
as
the
effect
of
light
and
shade
is
usually
to
show
up
the
edges
of
these
insidious
pitfalls
but
on
a
day
like
this
when
everything
looked
alike
one
advance
is
doubtful
we
kept
it
going
however
by
using
the
utmost
caution
wisting
came
near
to
sounding
the
depth
of
one
of
these
dangerous
crevasses
with
sledge
dogs
and
all
as
the
bridge
he
was
about
to
cross
gave
way
thanks
to
his
presence
of
mind
and
a
movement
some
would
call
it
luck
he
managed
to
save
himself
in
this
way
we
worked
up
about
feet
but
then
we
came
upon
such
a
labyrinth
of
yawning
chasms
and
open
abysses
that
we
could
not
move
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
find
the
least
disturbed
spot
and
set
the
tent
there
as
soon
as
this
was
done
hanssen
and
i
set
out
to
explore
we
were
roped
and
therefore
safe
enough
it
required
some
study
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
trap
we
had
run
ourselves
into
towards
the
group
of
mountains
last
described
which
now
lay
to
the
east
of
us
it
had
cleared
sufficiently
to
give
us
a
fairly
good
view
of
the
appearance
of
the
glacier
in
that
direction
what
we
had
before
seen
at
a
distance
was
now
confirmed
the
part
extending
to
the
mountains
was
so
ground
up
and
broken
that
there
was
positively
not
a
spot
where
one
could
set
one
foot
it
looked
as
if
a
battle
had
been
fought
here
and
the
ammunition
had
been
great
blocks
of
ice
they
lay
one
on
the
top
of
another
in
all
directions
and
evoked
a
picture
of
violent
confusion
thank
god
we
were
not
here
while
this
was
going
on
i
thought
to
myself
as
i
stood
looking
out
over
this
battlefield
it
must
have
been
a
spectacle
like
doomsday
and
not
on
a
small
scale
either
to
advance
in
that
direction
then
was
hopeless
but
that
was
no
great
matter
since
our
way
was
to
the
south
on
the
south
we
could
see
nothing
the
fog
lay
thick
and
heavy
there
all
we
could
do
was
to
try
to
make
our
way
on
and
we
therefore
crept
southward
on
leaving
our
tent
we
had
first
to
cross
a
comparatively
narrow
and
then
go
along
a
ridge
or
saddle
raised
by
pressure
with
wide
open
crevasses
on
both
sides
this
ridge
led
us
on
to
an
icewave
about
feet
high
a
formation
which
was
due
to
the
pressure
having
ceased
before
the
wave
had
been
forced
to
break
and
form
hummocks
we
saw
well
enough
that
this
would
be
a
difficult
place
to
pass
with
sledges
and
dogs
but
in
default
of
anything
better
it
would
have
to
be
done
from
the
top
of
this
we
could
see
down
on
the
other
side
which
had
hitherto
been
hidden
from
us
the
fog
prevented
our
seeing
far
but
the
immediate
surroundings
were
enough
to
convince
us
that
with
caution
we
could
beat
up
farther
from
the
height
on
which
we
stood
every
precaution
would
be
required
to
avoid
going
down
on
the
other
side
for
there
the
wave
ended
in
an
open
crevasse
specially
adapted
to
receive
any
drivers
sledges
or
dogs
that
might
make
a
slip
this
trip
that
hanssen
and
i
took
to
the
south
was
made
entirely
at
random
as
we
saw
absolutely
nothing
our
object
was
to
make
tracks
for
the
following
day
journey
the
language
we
used
about
the
glacier
as
we
went
was
not
altogether
complimentary
we
had
endless
tacking
and
turning
to
get
on
to
go
one
yard
forward
i
am
sure
we
had
to
go
at
least
ten
to
one
side
can
anyone
be
surprised
that
we
called
it
the
devil
glacier
at
any
rate
our
companions
acknowledged
the
justness
of
the
name
with
ringing
acclamations
when
we
told
them
of
it
at
hell
gate
hanssen
and
i
halted
this
was
a
very
remarkable
formation
the
glacier
had
here
formed
a
long
ridge
about
feet
high
then
in
the
middle
of
this
ridge
a
fissure
had
opened
making
a
gateway
about
feet
wide
this
formation
like
every
thing
else
on
the
obviously
very
old
and
for
the
most
part
filled
with
snow
from
this
point
the
glacier
as
far
as
our
view
extended
to
the
south
looked
better
and
better
we
therefore
turned
round
and
followed
our
tracks
in
the
comforting
conviction
that
we
should
manage
to
get
on
our
companions
were
no
less
pleased
with
the
news
we
brought
of
our
prospects
our
altitude
that
evening
was
feet
above
the
sea
that
is
to
say
at
the
foot
of
the
glacier
we
had
reached
an
altitude
of
feet
or
a
drop
from
the
butcher
of
feet
we
now
knew
very
well
that
we
should
have
this
ascent
to
make
again
perhaps
even
more
and
this
idea
did
not
arouse
any
particular
enthusiasm
in
my
diary
i
see
that
i
conclude
the
day
with
the
following
words
what
will
the
next
surprise
be
i
wonder
it
was
in
fact
an
extraordinary
journey
that
we
were
undertaking
through
new
regions
new
mountains
glaciers
and
so
on
without
being
able
to
see
that
we
were
prepared
for
surprises
was
perhaps
quite
natural
what
i
liked
least
about
this
feeling
one
way
forward
in
the
dark
was
that
it
would
be
difficult
very
difficult
indeed
to
recognize
the
ground
again
on
the
way
back
but
with
this
glacier
lying
straight
across
our
line
of
route
and
with
the
numerous
beacons
we
had
erected
we
reassured
ourselves
on
this
score
it
would
take
a
good
deal
to
make
us
miss
them
on
the
return
the
point
for
us
of
course
was
to
find
our
descent
on
to
the
barrier
again
a
mistake
there
might
be
serious
enough
and
it
will
appear
later
in
this
narrative
that
my
fear
of
our
not
being
able
to
recognize
the
way
was
not
entirely
groundless
the
beacons
we
had
put
up
came
to
our
aid
and
for
our
final
success
we
owe
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
to
our
prudence
and
thoughtfulness
in
adopting
this
expedient
next
morning
november
brought
considerably
clearer
weather
and
allowed
us
a
very
good
survey
of
our
position
we
could
now
see
that
the
two
mountain
ranges
uniting
in
were
continued
in
a
mighty
chain
running
to
the
with
summits
from
to
feet
mount
thorvald
nilsen
was
the
most
southerly
we
could
see
from
this
point
mounts
hanssen
wisting
bjaaland
and
hassel
formed
as
we
had
thought
the
day
before
a
group
by
themselves
and
lay
separated
from
the
main
range
the
drivers
had
a
warm
morning
work
they
had
to
drive
with
great
circumspection
and
patience
to
grapple
with
the
kind
of
ground
we
had
before
us
a
slight
mistake
might
be
enough
to
send
both
sledge
and
dogs
with
lightning
rapidity
into
the
next
world
it
took
nevertheless
a
remarkably
short
time
to
cover
the
distance
we
had
explored
on
the
previous
evening
before
we
knew
it
we
were
at
hell
gate
bjaaland
took
an
excellent
photograph
here
which
gives
a
very
good
idea
of
the
difficulties
this
part
of
the
journey
presented
in
the
foreground
below
the
high
that
forms
one
side
of
a
very
wide
but
partly
crevasse
the
marks
of
ski
can
be
seen
in
the
snow
this
was
the
photographer
who
in
passing
over
this
struck
his
ski
into
it
to
try
the
strength
of
the
support
close
to
the
tracks
can
be
seen
an
open
piece
of
the
crevasse
it
is
a
pale
blue
at
the
top
but
ends
in
the
deepest
black
in
a
bottomless
abyss
the
photographer
got
over
the
bridge
and
back
with
a
whole
skin
but
there
could
be
no
question
of
risking
sledges
and
dogs
on
it
and
it
can
be
seen
in
the
photograph
that
the
sledges
have
been
turned
right
round
to
try
another
way
the
two
small
black
figures
in
the
distance
on
the
right
are
hassel
and
i
who
are
reconnoitring
ahead
it
was
no
very
great
distance
that
we
put
behind
us
that
and
a
quarter
miles
in
a
straight
line
but
taking
into
account
all
the
turns
and
circuits
we
had
been
compelled
to
make
it
was
not
so
short
after
all
we
set
our
tent
on
a
good
solid
foundation
and
were
well
pleased
with
the
day
work
the
altitude
was
feet
above
the
sea
the
sun
was
now
in
the
west
and
shining
directly
upon
the
huge
mountain
masses
it
was
a
fairy
landscape
in
blue
and
white
red
and
black
a
play
of
colours
that
defies
description
clear
as
it
now
appeared
to
be
one
could
understand
that
the
weather
was
not
all
that
could
be
wished
for
the
end
of
mount
thorvald
nilsen
lost
itself
in
a
dark
impenetrable
cloud
which
led
one
to
suspect
a
continuation
in
that
direction
though
one
could
not
be
certain
mount
nilsen
ah
anything
more
beautiful
taking
it
altogether
i
have
never
seen
peaks
of
the
most
varied
forms
rose
high
into
the
air
partly
covered
with
driving
clouds
some
were
sharp
but
most
were
long
and
rounded
here
and
there
one
saw
bright
shining
glaciers
plunging
wildly
down
the
steep
sides
and
merging
into
the
underlying
ground
in
fearful
confusion
but
the
most
remarkable
of
them
all
was
mount
helmer
hanssen
its
top
was
as
round
as
the
bottom
of
a
bowl
and
covered
by
an
extraordinary
which
was
so
broken
up
and
disturbed
that
the
blocks
of
ice
bristled
in
every
direction
like
the
quills
of
a
porcupine
it
glittered
and
burned
in
the
sunlight
a
glorious
spectacle
there
could
only
be
one
such
mountain
in
the
world
and
as
a
landmark
it
was
priceless
we
knew
that
we
could
not
mistake
that
however
the
surroundings
might
appear
on
the
return
journey
when
possibly
the
conditions
of
lighting
might
be
altogether
different
after
camping
two
of
us
went
out
to
explore
farther
the
prospect
from
the
tent
was
not
encouraging
but
we
might
possibly
find
things
better
than
we
expected
we
were
lucky
to
find
the
going
so
fine
as
it
was
on
the
glacier
we
had
left
our
crampons
behind
at
the
butcher
shop
and
if
we
had
found
smooth
ice
instead
of
a
good
firm
snow
surface
such
as
we
now
had
it
would
have
caused
us
much
trouble
up
still
up
among
monsters
of
crevasses
some
of
them
hundreds
of
feet
wide
and
possibly
thousands
of
feet
deep
our
prospects
of
advancing
were
certainly
not
bright
as
far
as
we
could
see
in
the
line
of
our
route
one
immense
ridge
towered
above
another
concealing
on
their
farther
sides
huge
wide
chasms
which
all
had
to
be
avoided
we
went
forward
steadily
forward
though
the
way
round
was
both
long
and
troublesome
we
had
no
rope
on
this
time
as
the
irregularities
were
so
plain
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
go
into
them
it
turned
out
however
at
several
points
that
the
rope
would
not
have
been
out
of
place
we
were
just
going
to
cross
over
one
of
the
numerous
ridges
the
surface
here
looked
perfectly
whole
when
a
great
piece
broke
right
under
the
back
half
of
hanssen
ski
we
could
not
deny
ourselves
the
pleasure
of
glancing
down
into
the
hole
the
sight
was
not
an
inviting
one
and
we
agreed
to
avoid
this
place
when
we
came
on
with
our
dogs
and
sledges
every
day
we
had
occasion
to
bless
our
ski
we
often
used
to
ask
each
other
where
we
should
now
have
been
without
these
excellent
appliances
the
usual
answer
was
most
probably
at
the
bottom
of
some
crevasse
when
we
first
read
the
different
accounts
of
the
aspect
and
nature
of
the
barrier
it
was
clear
to
all
of
us
who
were
born
and
bred
with
ski
on
our
feet
that
these
must
be
regarded
as
indispensable
this
view
was
confirmed
and
strengthened
every
day
and
i
am
not
giving
too
much
credit
to
our
excellent
ski
when
i
say
that
they
not
only
played
a
very
important
part
but
possibly
the
most
important
of
all
on
our
journey
to
the
south
pole
many
a
time
we
traversed
stretches
of
surface
so
cleft
and
disturbed
that
it
would
have
been
an
impossibility
to
get
over
them
on
foot
i
need
scarcely
insist
on
the
advantages
of
ski
in
deep
loose
snow
after
advancing
for
two
hours
we
decided
to
return
from
the
raised
ridge
on
which
we
were
then
standing
the
surface
ahead
of
us
looked
more
promising
than
ever
but
we
had
so
often
been
deceived
on
the
glacier
that
we
had
now
become
definitely
sceptical
how
often
for
instance
had
we
thought
that
beyond
this
or
that
undulation
our
trials
would
be
at
an
end
and
that
the
way
to
the
south
would
lie
open
and
free
only
to
reach
the
place
and
find
that
the
ground
behind
the
ridge
was
if
possible
worse
than
what
we
had
already
been
struggling
with
but
this
time
we
seemed
somehow
to
feel
victory
in
the
air
the
formations
appeared
to
promise
it
and
yet
had
we
been
so
often
deceived
by
these
formations
that
we
now
refused
to
offer
them
a
thought
was
it
possibly
instinct
that
told
us
this
i
do
not
know
but
certain
it
is
that
hanssen
and
i
agreed
as
we
stood
there
discussing
our
prospects
that
behind
the
farthest
ridge
we
saw
we
should
conquer
the
glacier
we
had
a
feverish
desire
to
go
and
have
a
look
at
it
but
the
way
round
the
many
crevasses
was
long
and
i
may
as
well
admit
it
we
were
beginning
to
get
tired
the
return
downhill
as
it
was
did
not
take
long
and
soon
we
were
able
to
tell
our
comrades
that
the
prospects
for
the
morrow
were
very
promising
while
we
had
been
away
hassel
had
measured
the
nilsen
mountain
and
found
its
height
to
be
feet
above
the
sea
how
well
i
remember
that
evening
when
we
stood
contemplating
the
glorious
sight
that
nature
offered
and
believing
the
air
to
be
so
clear
that
anything
within
range
of
vision
must
have
shown
itself
and
how
well
too
i
remember
our
astonishment
on
the
return
journey
on
finding
the
whole
landscape
completely
transformed
if
it
had
not
been
for
mount
helmer
hanssen
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
us
to
know
where
we
were
the
atmosphere
in
these
regions
may
play
the
most
awkward
tricks
absolutely
clear
as
it
seemed
to
us
that
evening
it
nevertheless
turned
out
later
that
it
had
been
anything
but
clear
one
has
therefore
to
be
very
careful
about
what
one
sees
or
does
not
see
in
most
cases
it
has
proved
that
travellers
in
the
polar
regions
have
been
more
apt
to
see
too
much
than
too
little
if
however
we
had
charted
this
tract
as
we
saw
it
the
first
time
a
great
part
of
the
mountain
ranges
would
have
been
omitted
during
the
night
a
gale
sprang
up
from
the
and
blew
so
that
it
howled
in
the
of
the
tent
it
was
well
that
the
had
a
good
hold
in
the
morning
while
we
were
at
breakfast
it
was
still
blowing
and
we
had
some
thoughts
of
waiting
for
a
time
but
suddenly
without
warning
the
wind
dropped
to
such
an
extent
that
all
our
hesitation
vanished
what
a
change
the
wind
had
produced
the
splendid
covering
of
snow
that
the
day
before
had
made
a
pleasure
was
now
swept
away
over
great
stretches
of
surface
exposing
the
hard
substratum
our
thoughts
flew
back
the
crampons
we
had
left
behind
seemed
to
dance
before
my
eyes
backwards
and
forwards
grinning
and
pointing
fingers
at
me
it
would
be
a
nice
little
extra
trip
back
to
the
butcher
to
fetch
them
meanwhile
we
packed
and
made
everything
ready
the
tracks
of
the
day
before
were
not
easy
to
follow
but
if
we
lost
them
now
and
again
on
the
smooth
ice
surface
we
picked
them
up
later
on
a
that
had
resisted
the
attack
of
the
wind
it
was
hard
and
strenuous
work
for
the
drivers
the
sledges
were
difficult
to
manage
over
the
smooth
sloping
ice
sometimes
they
went
straight
but
just
as
often
requiring
sharp
attention
to
keep
them
from
capsizing
and
this
had
to
be
prevented
at
all
costs
as
the
thin
provision
cases
would
not
stand
many
bumps
on
the
ice
besides
which
it
was
such
hard
work
righting
the
sledges
again
that
for
this
reason
alone
the
drivers
exercised
the
greatest
care
the
sledges
were
put
to
a
severe
test
that
day
with
the
many
great
and
hard
irregularities
we
encountered
on
the
glacier
it
is
a
wonder
they
survived
it
and
is
a
good
testimonial
for
bjaaland
work
the
glacier
that
day
presented
the
worst
confusion
we
had
yet
had
to
deal
with
hassel
and
i
went
in
front
as
usual
with
the
rope
on
up
to
the
spot
hanssen
and
i
had
reached
the
evening
before
our
progress
was
comparatively
easy
one
gets
on
so
much
quicker
when
one
knows
that
the
way
is
practicable
after
this
point
it
became
worse
indeed
it
was
often
so
bad
that
we
had
to
stop
for
a
long
time
and
try
in
various
directions
before
finding
a
way
more
than
once
the
axe
had
to
be
used
to
hack
away
obstructions
at
one
time
things
looked
really
serious
chasm
after
chasm
hummock
after
hummock
so
high
and
steep
that
they
were
like
mountains
here
we
went
out
and
explored
in
every
direction
to
find
a
passage
at
last
we
found
one
if
indeed
it
deserved
the
name
of
a
passage
it
was
a
bridge
so
narrow
that
it
scarcely
allowed
room
for
the
width
of
the
sledge
a
fearful
abyss
on
each
side
the
crossing
of
this
place
reminded
me
of
the
walker
going
over
niagara
it
was
a
good
thing
none
of
us
was
subject
to
giddiness
and
that
the
dogs
did
not
know
exactly
what
the
result
of
a
false
step
would
be
on
the
other
side
of
this
bridge
we
began
to
go
downhill
and
our
course
now
lay
in
a
long
valley
between
lofty
undulations
on
each
side
it
tried
our
patience
severely
to
advance
here
as
the
line
of
the
hollow
was
fairly
long
and
ran
due
west
we
tried
several
times
to
lay
our
course
towards
the
south
and
clamber
up
the
side
of
the
undulation
but
these
efforts
did
not
pay
us
we
could
always
get
up
on
to
the
ridge
but
we
could
not
come
down
again
on
the
other
side
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
follow
the
natural
course
of
the
valley
until
it
took
us
into
the
tract
lying
to
the
south
it
was
especially
the
drivers
whose
patience
was
sorely
tried
and
i
could
see
them
now
and
then
take
a
turn
up
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
not
satisfied
with
the
exploration
hassel
and
i
had
made
but
the
result
was
always
the
same
they
had
to
submit
to
nature
caprices
and
follow
in
our
tracks
our
course
along
this
natural
line
was
not
entirely
free
from
obstruction
crevasses
of
various
dimensions
constantly
crossed
our
path
the
ridge
or
undulation
at
the
top
of
which
we
at
last
arrived
had
quite
an
imposing
effect
it
terminated
on
the
east
in
a
steep
drop
to
the
underlying
surface
and
attained
at
this
point
a
height
of
over
feet
on
the
west
it
sloped
gradually
into
the
lower
ground
and
allowed
us
to
advance
that
way
in
order
to
have
a
better
view
of
the
surroundings
we
ascended
the
eastern
and
highest
part
of
the
ridge
and
from
here
we
at
once
had
a
confirmation
of
our
supposition
of
the
day
before
the
ridge
we
had
then
seen
behind
which
we
hoped
to
find
better
conditions
could
now
be
seen
a
good
way
ahead
and
what
we
then
saw
made
our
hearts
beat
fast
with
joy
could
that
great
white
unbroken
plain
over
there
be
real
or
was
it
only
an
illusion
time
would
show
meanwhile
hassel
and
i
jogged
on
and
the
others
followed
we
had
to
get
through
a
good
many
difficulties
yet
before
we
reached
that
point
but
compared
with
all
the
breakneck
places
we
had
already
crossed
these
were
of
a
comparatively
tame
description
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
we
arrived
at
the
plain
that
promised
so
well
its
extent
was
not
very
great
but
we
were
not
very
exacting
either
in
this
respect
after
our
last
few
days
march
over
the
broken
surface
farther
to
the
south
we
could
still
see
great
masses
piled
up
by
pressure
but
the
intervals
between
them
were
very
great
and
the
surface
was
whole
this
was
then
the
first
time
since
we
tackled
the
devil
glacier
that
we
were
able
to
steer
true
south
for
a
few
minutes
as
we
progressed
it
could
be
seen
that
we
had
really
come
upon
another
kind
of
ground
for
once
we
had
not
been
made
fools
of
not
that
we
had
an
unbroken
level
surface
to
go
upon
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
we
came
to
that
but
we
were
able
to
keep
our
course
for
long
stretches
at
a
time
the
huge
crevasses
became
rarer
and
so
filled
up
at
both
ends
that
we
were
able
to
cross
them
without
going
a
long
way
round
there
was
new
life
in
all
of
us
both
dogs
and
men
and
we
went
rapidly
southward
as
we
advanced
the
conditions
improved
more
and
more
we
could
see
in
the
distance
some
huge
formations
that
seemed
to
tower
high
into
the
air
these
turned
out
to
be
the
southernmost
limit
of
the
big
crevasses
and
to
form
the
transition
to
the
third
phase
of
the
glacier
it
was
a
stiff
climb
to
get
up
these
domes
which
were
fairly
high
and
swept
smooth
by
the
wind
they
lay
straight
in
our
course
and
from
their
tops
we
had
a
good
view
the
surface
we
were
entering
upon
was
quite
different
from
that
on
the
northern
side
of
the
domes
here
the
big
crevasses
were
entirely
filled
with
snow
and
might
be
crossed
anywhere
what
specially
attracted
one
attention
here
was
an
immense
number
of
small
formations
in
the
shape
of
haycocks
great
stretches
of
the
surface
were
swept
bare
exposing
the
smooth
ice
it
was
evident
that
these
various
formations
or
phases
in
the
glacier
were
due
to
the
underlying
ground
the
first
tract
we
had
passed
where
the
confusion
was
so
extreme
must
be
the
part
that
lay
nearest
the
bare
land
in
proportion
as
the
glacier
left
the
land
it
became
less
disturbed
in
the
haycock
district
the
disturbance
had
not
produced
cracks
in
the
surface
to
any
extent
only
upheaval
here
and
there
how
these
haycocks
were
formed
and
what
they
looked
like
inside
we
were
soon
to
find
out
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
advance
all
the
time
instead
of
constantly
turning
and
going
round
only
once
or
twice
did
we
have
to
turn
aside
for
the
larger
haycocks
otherwise
we
kept
our
course
the
great
stretches
of
surface
that
we
came
upon
from
time
to
time
were
split
in
every
direction
but
the
cracks
were
very
narrow
about
half
an
inch
wide
we
had
difficulty
in
finding
a
place
for
the
tent
that
evening
the
surface
was
equally
hard
everywhere
and
at
last
we
had
to
set
it
on
the
bare
ice
luckily
for
our
this
ice
was
not
of
the
bright
steely
variety
it
was
more
milky
in
appearance
and
not
so
hard
and
we
were
thus
able
to
knock
in
the
pegs
with
the
axe
when
the
tent
was
up
hassel
went
out
as
usual
to
fetch
snow
for
the
cooker
as
a
rule
he
performed
this
task
with
a
big
knife
specially
made
for
snow
but
this
evening
he
went
out
armed
with
an
axe
he
was
very
pleased
with
the
abundant
and
excellent
material
that
lay
to
his
hand
there
was
no
need
to
go
far
just
outside
the
tent
door
two
feet
away
stood
a
fine
little
haycock
that
looked
as
if
it
would
serve
the
purpose
well
hassel
raised
his
axe
and
gave
a
good
sound
blow
the
axe
met
with
no
resistance
and
went
in
up
to
the
haft
the
haycock
was
hollow
as
the
axe
was
pulled
out
the
surrounding
part
gave
way
and
one
could
hear
the
pieces
of
ice
falling
down
through
the
dark
hole
it
appeared
then
that
two
feet
from
our
door
we
had
a
most
convenient
way
down
into
the
cellar
hassel
looked
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
situation
black
as
a
sack
he
smiled
could
see
any
bottom
hanssen
was
beaming
no
doubt
he
would
have
liked
the
tent
a
little
nearer
the
material
provided
by
the
haycock
was
of
the
best
quality
and
well
adapted
for
cooking
purposes
the
next
day
december
was
a
very
fatiguing
one
for
us
all
from
early
morning
a
blinding
blizzard
raged
from
the
with
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
the
going
was
of
the
very
worst
kind
polished
ice
i
stumbled
forward
on
ski
and
had
comparatively
easy
work
the
drivers
had
been
obliged
to
take
off
their
ski
and
put
them
on
the
loads
so
as
to
walk
by
the
side
support
the
sledges
and
give
the
dogs
help
when
they
came
to
a
difficult
place
and
that
was
pretty
often
for
on
this
smooth
ice
surface
there
were
a
number
of
small
scattered
sastrugi
and
these
consisted
of
a
kind
of
snow
that
reminded
one
more
of
than
of
anything
else
when
the
sledges
came
in
contact
with
it
the
dogs
could
get
no
hold
with
their
claws
on
the
smooth
ice
and
when
the
sledge
came
on
to
one
of
these
tough
little
waves
they
could
not
manage
to
haul
it
over
try
as
they
might
the
driver
then
had
to
put
all
his
strength
into
it
to
prevent
the
sledge
stopping
thus
in
most
cases
the
combined
efforts
of
men
and
dogs
carried
the
sledge
on
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
surface
again
began
to
be
more
disturbed
and
great
crevasses
crossed
our
path
time
after
time
these
crevasses
were
really
rather
dangerous
they
looked
very
innocent
as
they
were
quite
filled
up
with
snow
but
on
a
nearer
acquaintance
with
them
we
came
to
understand
that
they
were
far
more
hazardous
than
we
dreamed
of
at
first
it
turned
out
that
between
the
loose
and
the
firm
ice
edges
there
was
a
fairly
broad
open
space
leading
straight
down
into
the
depths
the
layer
of
snow
which
covered
it
over
was
in
most
cases
quite
thin
in
driving
out
into
one
of
these
crevasses
nothing
happened
as
a
rule
but
it
was
in
getting
off
on
the
other
side
that
the
critical
moment
arrived
for
here
the
dogs
came
up
on
to
the
smooth
ice
surface
and
could
get
no
hold
for
their
claws
with
the
result
that
it
was
left
entirely
to
the
driver
to
haul
the
the
sledge
up
the
strong
pull
he
then
had
to
give
sent
him
through
the
thin
layer
of
snow
under
these
circumstances
he
took
a
good
firm
hold
of
the
or
of
a
special
strap
that
had
been
made
with
a
view
to
these
accidents
but
familiarity
breeds
contempt
even
with
the
most
cautious
and
some
of
the
drivers
were
often
within
an
ace
of
going
down
into
the
cellar
if
this
part
of
the
journey
was
trying
for
the
dogs
it
was
certainly
no
less
so
for
the
men
if
the
weather
had
even
been
fine
so
that
we
could
have
looked
about
us
we
should
not
have
minded
it
so
much
but
in
this
vile
weather
it
was
indeed
no
pleasure
our
time
was
also
a
good
deal
taken
up
with
thawing
noses
and
cheeks
as
they
froze
not
that
we
stopped
we
had
no
time
for
that
we
simply
took
off
a
mit
and
laid
the
warm
hand
on
the
frozen
spot
as
we
went
when
we
thought
we
had
restored
sensation
we
put
the
hand
back
into
the
mit
by
this
time
it
would
want
warming
one
does
not
keep
one
hands
bare
for
long
with
the
thermometer
several
degrees
below
zero
and
a
storm
blowing
in
spite
of
the
unfavourable
conditions
we
had
been
working
in
the
that
evening
showed
a
distance
of
fifteen
and
a
half
miles
we
were
well
satisfied
with
the
day
work
when
we
camped
let
us
cast
a
glance
into
the
tent
this
evening
it
looks
cosy
enough
the
inner
half
of
the
tent
is
occupied
by
three
whose
respective
owners
have
found
it
both
comfortable
and
expedient
to
turn
in
and
may
now
be
seen
engaged
with
their
diaries
the
outer
half
that
nearest
the
door
has
only
two
but
the
rest
of
the
space
is
taken
up
with
the
whole
cooking
apparatus
of
the
expedition
the
owners
of
these
two
bags
are
still
sitting
up
hanssen
is
cook
and
will
not
turn
in
until
the
food
is
ready
and
served
wisting
is
his
sworn
comrade
and
assistant
and
is
ready
to
lend
him
any
aid
that
may
be
required
hanssen
appears
to
be
a
careful
cook
he
evidently
does
not
like
to
burn
the
food
and
his
spoon
stirs
the
contents
of
the
pot
incessantly
soup
the
effect
of
the
word
is
instantaneous
everyone
sits
up
at
once
with
a
cup
in
one
hand
and
a
spoon
in
the
other
each
one
in
his
turn
has
his
cup
filled
with
what
looks
like
the
most
tasty
vegetable
soup
scalding
hot
it
is
as
one
can
see
by
the
faces
but
for
all
that
it
disappears
with
surprising
rapidity
again
the
cups
are
filled
this
time
with
more
solid
stuff
pemmican
with
praiseworthy
despatch
their
contents
are
once
more
demolished
and
they
are
filled
for
the
third
time
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
these
men
appetites
the
cups
are
carefully
scraped
and
the
enjoyment
of
bread
and
water
begins
it
is
easy
to
see
too
that
it
is
an
enjoyment
greater
to
judge
by
the
pleasure
on
their
faces
than
the
most
skilfully
devised
menu
could
afford
they
positively
caress
the
biscuits
before
they
eat
them
and
the
water
water
they
all
call
for
this
also
disappears
in
great
quantities
and
procures
i
feel
certain
from
their
expression
a
far
greater
pleasure
and
satisfaction
than
the
finest
wine
that
was
ever
produced
the
primus
hums
softly
during
the
whole
meal
and
the
temperature
in
the
tent
is
quite
pleasant
when
the
meal
is
over
one
of
them
calls
for
scissors
and
and
then
one
may
see
the
polar
explorers
dressing
their
hair
for
the
approaching
sunday
the
beard
is
cut
quite
short
with
the
clipper
every
saturday
evening
this
is
done
not
so
much
from
motives
of
vanity
as
from
considerations
of
utility
and
comfort
the
beard
invites
an
accumulation
of
ice
which
may
often
be
very
embarrassing
a
beard
in
the
polar
regions
seems
to
me
to
be
just
as
awkward
and
unpractical
as
well
let
us
say
walking
with
a
tall
hat
on
each
foot
as
the
and
the
mirror
make
their
round
one
after
the
other
disappears
into
his
bag
and
with
five
silence
falls
upon
the
tent
the
regular
breathing
soon
announces
that
the
day
work
demands
its
tribute
meanwhile
the
howls
and
the
snow
beats
against
the
tent
the
dogs
have
curled
themselves
up
and
do
not
seem
to
trouble
themselves
about
the
weather
the
storm
continued
unabated
on
the
following
day
and
on
account
of
the
dangerous
nature
of
the
ground
we
decided
to
wait
awhile
in
the
course
of
the
morning
towards
noon
perhaps
the
wind
dropped
a
little
and
out
we
went
the
sun
peeped
through
at
times
and
we
took
the
welcome
opportunity
of
getting
an
altitude
was
the
result
at
this
camp
we
left
behind
all
our
delightful
clothing
as
we
could
see
that
we
should
have
no
use
for
it
the
temperature
being
far
too
high
we
kept
the
hoods
of
our
reindeer
coats
however
we
might
be
glad
of
them
in
going
against
the
wind
our
day
march
was
not
to
be
a
long
one
the
little
slackening
of
the
wind
about
midday
was
only
a
joke
it
soon
came
on
again
in
earnest
with
a
sweeping
blizzard
from
the
same
quarter
the
if
we
had
known
the
ground
we
should
possibly
have
gone
on
but
in
this
storm
and
driving
snow
which
prevented
our
keeping
our
eyes
open
it
was
no
use
a
serious
accident
might
happen
and
ruin
all
two
and
half
miles
was
therefore
our
whole
distance
the
temperature
when
we
camped
was
height
above
the
sea
feet
in
the
course
of
the
night
the
wind
veered
from
to
north
falling
light
and
the
weather
cleared
this
was
a
good
chance
for
us
and
we
were
not
slow
to
avail
ourselves
of
it
a
gradually
rising
ice
surface
lay
before
us
bright
as
a
mirror
as
on
the
preceding
days
i
stumbled
along
in
front
on
ski
while
the
others
without
their
ski
had
to
follow
and
support
the
sledges
the
surface
still
offered
filled
crevasses
though
perhaps
less
frequently
than
before
meanwhile
small
patches
of
snow
began
to
show
themselves
on
the
polished
surface
and
soon
increased
in
number
and
size
until
before
very
long
they
united
and
covered
the
unpleasant
ice
with
a
good
and
even
layer
of
snow
then
ski
were
put
on
again
and
we
continued
our
way
to
the
south
with
satisfaction
we
were
all
rejoicing
that
we
had
now
conquered
this
treacherous
glacier
and
congratulating
ourselves
on
having
at
last
arrived
on
the
actual
plateau
as
we
were
going
along
feeling
pleased
about
this
a
ridge
suddenly
appeared
right
ahead
telling
us
plainly
that
perhaps
all
our
sorrows
were
not
yet
ended
the
ground
had
begun
to
sink
a
little
and
as
we
came
nearer
we
could
see
that
we
had
to
cross
a
rather
wide
but
not
deep
valley
before
we
arrived
under
the
ridge
great
lines
of
hummocks
and
pieces
of
ice
came
in
view
on
every
side
we
could
see
that
we
should
have
to
keep
our
eyes
open
and
now
we
came
to
the
formation
in
the
glacier
that
we
called
the
devil
ballroom
little
by
little
the
covering
of
snow
that
we
had
praised
in
such
high
terms
disappeared
and
before
us
lay
this
wide
valley
bare
and
gleaming
at
first
it
went
well
enough
as
it
was
downhill
we
were
going
at
a
good
pace
on
the
smooth
ice
suddenly
wisting
sledge
cut
into
the
surface
and
turned
over
on
its
side
we
all
knew
what
had
happened
one
of
the
runners
was
in
a
crevasse
wisting
set
to
work
with
the
assistance
of
hassel
to
raise
the
sledge
and
take
it
out
of
its
dangerous
position
meanwhile
bjaaland
had
got
out
his
camera
and
was
setting
it
up
accustomed
as
we
were
to
such
incidents
hanssen
and
i
were
watching
the
scene
from
a
point
a
little
way
in
advance
where
we
had
arrived
when
it
happened
as
the
photography
took
rather
a
long
time
i
assumed
that
the
crevasse
was
one
of
the
filled
ones
and
presented
no
particular
danger
but
that
bjaaland
wanted
to
have
a
souvenir
among
his
photographs
of
the
numerous
crevasses
and
ticklish
situations
we
had
been
exposed
to
as
to
the
crack
being
filled
up
there
was
of
course
no
need
to
inquire
i
hailed
them
and
asked
how
they
were
getting
on
oh
all
right
was
the
answer
we
just
finished
what
does
the
crevasse
look
like
oh
as
usual
they
shouted
back
no
bottom
i
mention
this
little
incident
just
to
show
how
one
can
grow
accustomed
to
anything
in
this
world
there
were
these
two
wisting
and
hassel
lying
over
a
yawning
bottomless
abyss
and
having
their
photograph
taken
neither
of
them
gave
a
thought
to
the
serious
side
of
the
situation
to
judge
from
the
laughter
and
jokes
we
heard
one
would
have
thought
their
position
was
something
quite
different
when
the
photographer
had
quietly
and
leisurely
finished
his
work
he
got
a
remarkably
good
picture
of
the
scene
the
other
two
together
raised
the
sledge
and
the
journey
was
continued
it
was
at
this
crevasse
that
we
entered
his
majesty
ballroom
the
surface
did
not
really
look
bad
true
the
snow
was
blown
away
which
made
it
difficult
to
advance
but
we
did
not
see
many
cracks
there
were
a
good
many
as
already
mentioned
but
even
in
the
neighbourhood
of
these
we
could
not
see
any
marked
disturbance
the
first
sign
that
the
surface
was
more
treacherous
than
it
appeared
to
be
was
when
hanssen
leading
dogs
went
right
through
the
apparently
solid
floor
they
remained
hanging
by
their
harness
and
were
easily
pulled
up
again
when
we
looked
through
the
hole
they
had
made
in
the
crust
it
did
not
give
us
the
impression
of
being
very
dangerous
as
or
feet
below
the
outer
crust
there
lay
another
surface
which
appeared
to
consist
of
pulverized
ice
we
assumed
that
this
lower
surface
was
the
solid
one
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
danger
in
falling
through
the
upper
one
but
bjaaland
was
able
to
tell
us
a
different
story
he
had
in
fact
fallen
through
the
outer
crust
and
was
well
on
his
way
through
the
inner
one
as
well
when
he
got
hold
of
a
loop
of
rope
on
his
sledge
and
saved
himself
in
the
nick
of
time
time
after
time
the
dogs
now
fell
through
and
time
after
time
the
men
went
in
the
effect
of
the
open
space
between
the
two
crusts
was
that
the
ground
under
our
feet
sounded
unpleasantly
hollow
as
we
went
over
it
the
drivers
whipped
up
their
dogs
as
much
as
they
could
and
with
shouts
and
brisk
encouragement
they
went
rapidly
over
the
treacherous
floor
fortunately
this
curious
formation
was
not
of
great
extent
and
we
soon
began
to
observe
a
change
for
the
better
as
we
came
up
the
ridge
it
soon
appeared
that
the
ballroom
was
the
glacier
last
farewell
to
us
with
it
all
irregularities
ceased
and
both
surface
and
going
improved
by
leaps
and
bounds
so
that
before
very
long
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
that
at
last
we
had
really
conquered
all
these
unpleasant
difficulties
the
surface
at
once
became
fine
and
even
with
a
splendid
covering
of
snow
everywhere
and
we
went
rapidly
on
our
way
to
the
south
with
a
feeling
of
security
and
safety
chapter
xii
at
the
pole
in
lat
according
to
dead
reckoning
we
saw
the
last
of
the
land
to
the
the
atmosphere
was
then
apparently
as
clear
as
could
be
and
we
felt
certain
that
our
view
covered
all
the
land
there
was
to
be
seen
from
that
spot
we
were
deceived
again
on
this
occasion
as
will
be
seen
later
our
distance
that
day
december
was
close
upon
miles
height
above
the
sea
feet
the
weather
did
not
continue
fine
for
long
next
day
december
there
was
a
gale
from
the
north
and
once
more
the
whole
plain
was
a
mass
of
drifting
snow
in
addition
to
this
there
was
thick
falling
snow
which
blinded
us
and
made
things
worse
but
a
feeling
of
security
had
come
over
us
and
helped
us
to
advance
rapidly
and
without
hesitation
although
we
could
see
nothing
that
day
we
encountered
new
surface
conditions
big
hard
sastrugi
these
were
anything
but
pleasant
to
work
among
especially
when
one
could
not
see
them
it
was
of
no
use
for
us
forerunners
to
think
of
going
in
advance
under
these
circumstances
as
it
was
impossible
to
keep
on
one
feet
three
or
four
paces
was
often
the
most
we
managed
to
do
before
falling
down
the
sastrugi
were
very
high
and
often
abrupt
if
one
came
on
them
unexpectedly
one
required
to
be
more
than
an
acrobat
to
keep
on
one
feet
the
plan
we
found
to
work
best
in
these
conditions
was
to
let
hanssen
dogs
go
first
this
was
an
unpleasant
job
for
hanssen
and
for
his
dogs
too
but
it
succeeded
and
succeeded
well
an
upset
here
and
there
was
of
course
unavoidable
but
with
a
little
patience
the
sledge
was
always
righted
again
the
drivers
had
as
much
as
they
could
do
to
support
their
sledges
among
these
sastrugi
but
while
supporting
the
sledges
they
had
at
the
same
time
a
support
for
themselves
it
was
worse
for
us
who
had
no
sledges
but
by
keeping
in
the
wake
of
them
we
could
see
where
the
irregularities
lay
and
thus
get
over
them
hanssen
deserves
a
special
word
of
praise
for
his
driving
on
this
surface
in
such
weather
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
drive
eskimo
dogs
forward
when
they
can
not
see
but
hanssen
managed
it
well
both
getting
the
dogs
on
and
steering
his
course
by
compass
one
would
not
think
it
possible
to
keep
an
approximately
right
course
when
the
uneven
ground
gives
such
violent
shocks
that
the
needle
flies
several
times
round
the
compass
and
is
no
sooner
still
again
than
it
recommences
the
same
dance
but
when
at
last
we
got
an
observation
it
turned
out
that
hanssen
had
steered
to
a
hair
for
the
observations
and
dead
reckoning
agreed
to
a
mile
in
spite
of
all
hindrances
and
of
being
able
to
see
nothing
the
showed
nearly
miles
the
hypsometer
showed
feet
above
the
sea
we
had
therefore
reached
a
greater
altitude
than
the
butcher
december
brought
the
same
weather
thick
snow
sky
and
plain
all
one
nothing
to
be
seen
nevertheless
we
made
splendid
progress
the
sastrugi
gradually
became
levelled
out
until
the
surface
was
perfectly
smooth
it
was
a
relief
to
have
even
ground
to
go
upon
once
more
these
irregularities
that
one
was
constantly
falling
over
were
a
nuisance
if
we
had
met
with
them
in
our
usual
surroundings
it
would
not
have
mattered
so
much
but
up
here
on
the
high
ground
where
we
had
to
stand
and
gasp
for
breath
every
time
we
rolled
over
it
was
certainly
not
pleasant
that
day
we
passed
and
camped
in
a
great
surprise
awaited
us
in
the
tent
that
evening
i
expected
to
find
as
on
the
previous
evening
that
the
had
fallen
somewhat
in
other
words
that
it
would
show
a
continued
rise
of
the
ground
but
to
our
astonishment
this
was
not
so
the
water
boiled
at
exactly
the
same
temperature
as
on
the
preceding
day
i
tried
it
several
times
to
convince
myself
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
each
time
with
the
same
result
there
was
great
rejoicing
among
us
all
when
i
was
able
to
announce
that
we
had
arrived
on
the
top
of
the
plateau
december
began
like
the
with
absolutely
thick
weather
but
as
they
say
you
never
know
what
the
day
is
like
before
sunset
possibly
i
might
have
chosen
a
better
expression
than
this
last
one
more
in
agreement
with
the
natural
conditions
but
i
will
let
it
stand
though
for
several
weeks
now
the
sun
had
not
set
my
readers
will
not
be
so
critical
as
to
reproach
me
with
inaccuracy
with
a
light
wind
from
the
we
now
went
southward
at
a
good
speed
over
the
perfectly
level
plain
with
excellent
going
the
uphill
work
had
taken
it
out
of
our
dogs
though
not
to
any
serious
extent
they
had
turned
greedy
there
is
no
denying
that
and
the
half
kilo
of
pemmican
they
got
each
day
was
not
enough
to
fill
their
stomachs
early
and
late
they
were
looking
for
something
no
matter
what
to
devour
to
begin
with
they
contented
themselves
with
such
loose
objects
as
whips
boots
and
the
like
but
as
we
came
to
know
their
proclivities
we
took
such
care
of
everything
that
they
found
no
extra
meals
lying
about
but
that
was
not
the
end
of
the
matter
they
then
went
for
the
fixed
lashings
of
the
sledges
and
if
we
had
allowed
it
would
very
quickly
have
resolved
the
various
sledges
into
their
component
parts
but
we
found
a
way
of
stopping
that
every
evening
on
halting
the
sledges
were
buried
in
the
snow
so
as
to
hide
all
the
lashings
that
was
successful
curiously
enough
they
never
tried
to
force
the
snow
rampart
i
may
mention
as
a
curious
thing
that
these
ravenous
animals
that
devoured
everything
they
came
across
even
to
the
ebonite
points
of
our
never
made
any
attempt
to
break
into
the
provision
cases
they
lay
there
and
went
about
among
the
sledges
with
their
noses
just
on
a
level
with
the
split
cases
seeing
and
scenting
the
pemmican
without
once
making
a
sign
of
taking
any
but
if
one
raised
a
lid
they
were
not
long
in
showing
themselves
then
they
all
came
in
a
great
hurry
and
flocked
about
the
sledges
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
little
extra
bit
i
am
at
a
loss
to
explain
this
behaviour
that
bashfulness
was
not
at
the
root
of
it
i
am
tolerably
certain
during
the
forenoon
the
thick
grey
curtain
of
cloud
began
to
grow
thinner
on
the
horizon
and
for
the
first
time
for
three
days
we
could
see
a
few
miles
about
us
the
feeling
was
something
like
that
one
has
on
waking
from
a
good
nap
rubbing
one
eyes
and
looking
around
we
had
become
so
accustomed
to
the
grey
twilight
that
this
positively
dazzled
us
meanwhile
the
upper
layer
of
air
seemed
obstinately
to
remain
the
same
and
to
be
doing
its
best
to
prevent
the
sun
from
showing
itself
we
badly
wanted
to
get
a
meridian
altitude
so
that
we
could
determine
our
latitude
since
we
had
had
no
observation
and
it
was
not
easy
to
say
when
we
should
get
one
hitherto
the
weather
conditions
on
the
high
ground
had
not
been
particularly
favourable
although
the
prospects
were
not
very
promising
we
halted
at
and
made
ready
to
catch
the
sun
if
it
should
be
kind
enough
to
look
out
hassel
and
wisting
used
one
sextant
and
artificial
horizon
hanssen
and
i
the
other
set
i
do
know
that
i
have
ever
stood
and
absolutely
pulled
at
the
sun
to
get
it
out
as
i
did
that
time
if
we
got
an
observation
here
which
agreed
with
our
reckoning
then
it
would
be
possible
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
to
go
to
the
pole
on
dead
reckoning
but
if
we
got
none
now
it
was
a
question
whether
our
claim
to
the
pole
would
be
admitted
on
the
dead
reckoning
we
should
be
able
to
produce
whether
my
pulling
helped
or
not
it
is
certain
that
the
sun
appeared
it
was
not
very
brilliant
to
begin
with
but
practised
as
we
now
were
in
availing
ourselves
of
even
the
poorest
chances
it
was
good
enough
down
it
came
was
checked
by
all
and
the
altitude
written
down
the
curtain
of
cloud
was
rent
more
and
more
and
before
we
had
finished
our
work
that
is
to
say
caught
the
sun
at
its
highest
and
convinced
ourselves
that
it
was
descending
again
it
was
shining
in
all
its
glory
we
had
put
away
our
instruments
and
were
sitting
on
the
sledges
engaged
in
the
calculations
i
can
safely
say
that
we
were
excited
what
would
the
result
be
after
marching
blindly
for
so
long
and
over
such
impossible
ground
as
we
had
been
doing
we
added
and
subtracted
and
at
last
there
was
the
result
we
looked
at
each
other
in
sheer
incredulity
the
result
was
as
astonishing
as
the
most
consummate
conjuring
trick
precisely
to
a
minute
the
same
as
our
reckoning
if
we
were
forced
to
go
to
the
pole
on
dead
reckoning
then
surely
the
most
exacting
would
admit
our
right
to
do
so
we
put
away
our
observation
books
ate
one
or
two
biscuits
and
went
at
it
again
we
had
a
great
piece
of
work
before
us
that
day
nothing
less
than
carrying
our
flag
farther
south
than
the
foot
of
man
had
trod
we
had
our
silk
flag
ready
it
was
made
fast
to
two
and
laid
on
hanssen
sledge
i
had
given
him
orders
that
as
soon
as
we
had
covered
the
distance
to
which
was
shackleton
farthest
south
the
flag
was
to
be
hoisted
on
his
sledge
it
was
my
turn
as
forerunner
and
i
pushed
on
there
was
no
longer
any
difficulty
in
holding
course
i
had
the
grandest
to
steer
by
and
everything
now
went
like
a
machine
first
came
the
forerunner
for
the
time
being
then
hanssen
then
wisting
and
finally
bjaaland
the
forerunner
who
was
not
on
duty
went
where
he
liked
as
a
rule
he
accompanied
one
or
other
of
the
sledges
i
had
long
ago
fallen
into
a
reverie
far
removed
from
the
scene
in
which
i
was
moving
what
i
thought
about
i
do
not
remember
now
but
i
was
so
preoccupied
that
i
had
entirely
forgotten
my
surroundings
then
suddenly
i
was
roused
from
my
dreaming
by
a
jubilant
shout
followed
by
ringing
cheers
i
turned
round
quickly
to
discover
the
reason
of
this
unwonted
occurrence
and
stood
speechless
and
overcome
i
find
it
impossible
to
express
the
feelings
that
possessed
me
at
this
moment
all
the
sledges
had
stopped
and
from
the
foremost
of
them
the
norwegian
flag
was
flying
it
shook
itself
out
waved
and
flapped
so
that
the
silk
rustled
it
looked
wonderfully
well
in
the
pure
clear
air
and
the
shining
white
surroundings
was
past
we
were
farther
south
than
any
human
being
had
been
no
other
moment
of
the
whole
trip
affected
me
like
this
the
tears
forced
their
way
to
my
eyes
by
no
effort
of
will
could
i
keep
them
back
it
was
the
flag
yonder
that
conquered
me
and
my
will
luckily
i
was
some
way
in
advance
of
the
others
so
that
i
had
time
to
pull
myself
together
and
master
my
feelings
before
reaching
my
comrades
we
all
shook
hands
with
mutual
congratulations
we
had
won
our
way
far
by
holding
together
and
we
would
go
farther
yet
to
the
end
we
did
not
pass
that
spot
without
according
our
highest
tribute
of
admiration
to
the
man
who
together
with
his
gallant
companions
had
planted
his
country
flag
so
infinitely
nearer
to
the
goal
than
any
of
his
precursors
sir
ernest
shackleton
name
will
always
be
written
in
the
annals
of
antarctic
exploration
in
letters
of
fire
pluck
and
grit
can
work
wonders
and
i
know
of
no
better
example
of
this
than
what
that
man
has
accomplished
the
cameras
of
course
had
to
come
out
and
we
got
an
excellent
photograph
of
the
scene
which
none
of
us
will
ever
forget
we
went
on
a
couple
of
miles
more
to
and
then
camped
the
weather
had
improved
and
kept
on
improving
all
the
time
it
was
now
almost
perfectly
calm
radiantly
clear
and
under
the
circumstances
quite
inside
the
tent
it
was
quite
sultry
this
was
more
than
we
had
expected
after
much
consideration
and
discussion
we
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
ought
to
lay
down
a
depot
the
last
one
at
this
spot
the
advantages
of
lightening
our
sledges
were
so
great
that
we
should
have
to
risk
it
nor
would
there
be
any
great
risk
attached
to
it
after
all
since
we
should
adopt
a
system
of
marks
that
would
lead
even
a
blind
man
back
to
the
place
we
had
determined
to
mark
it
not
only
at
right
angles
to
our
course
that
is
from
east
to
west
but
by
snow
beacons
at
every
two
geographical
miles
to
the
south
we
stayed
here
on
the
following
day
to
arrange
this
depot
dogs
were
real
marvels
all
of
them
nothing
seemed
to
have
any
effect
on
them
they
had
grown
rather
thinner
of
course
but
they
were
still
as
strong
as
ever
it
was
therefore
decided
not
to
lighten
sledge
but
only
the
two
others
both
wisting
and
bjaaland
teams
had
suffered
especially
the
latter
the
reduction
in
weight
that
was
effected
was
considerable
nearly
pounds
on
each
of
the
two
sledges
there
was
thus
about
pounds
in
the
depot
the
snow
here
was
for
building
but
we
put
up
quite
a
respectable
monument
all
the
same
it
was
dogs
pemmican
and
biscuits
that
were
left
behind
we
carried
with
us
on
the
sledges
provisions
for
about
a
month
if
therefore
contrary
to
expectation
we
should
be
so
unlucky
as
to
miss
this
depot
we
should
nevertheless
be
fairly
sure
of
reaching
our
depot
in
before
supplies
ran
short
the
of
the
depot
was
done
with
sixty
splinters
of
black
on
each
side
with
paces
between
each
every
other
one
had
a
shred
of
black
cloth
on
the
top
the
splinters
on
the
east
side
were
all
marked
so
that
on
seeing
them
we
should
know
instantly
that
we
were
to
the
east
of
the
depot
those
on
the
west
had
no
marks
the
warmth
of
the
past
few
days
seemed
to
have
matured
our
and
we
presented
an
awful
appearance
it
was
wisting
hanssen
and
i
who
had
suffered
the
worst
damage
in
the
last
blizzard
the
left
side
of
our
faces
was
one
mass
of
sore
bathed
in
matter
and
serum
we
looked
like
the
worst
type
of
tramps
and
ruffians
and
would
probably
not
have
been
recognized
by
our
nearest
relations
these
sores
were
a
great
trouble
to
us
during
the
latter
part
of
the
journey
the
slightest
gust
of
wind
produced
a
sensation
as
if
face
were
being
cut
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
blunt
knife
they
lasted
a
long
time
too
i
can
remember
hanssen
removing
the
last
scab
when
we
were
coming
into
hobart
three
months
later
we
were
very
lucky
in
the
weather
during
this
depot
work
the
sun
came
out
all
at
once
and
we
had
an
excellent
opportunity
of
taking
some
good
azimuth
observations
the
last
of
any
use
that
we
got
on
the
journey
december
arrived
with
the
same
fine
weather
and
sunshine
true
we
felt
our
rather
sharply
that
day
with
and
a
little
breeze
dead
against
us
but
that
could
not
be
helped
we
at
once
began
to
put
up
beacons
a
work
which
was
continued
with
great
regularity
right
up
to
the
pole
these
beacons
were
not
so
big
as
those
we
had
built
down
on
the
barrier
we
could
see
that
they
would
be
quite
large
enough
with
a
height
of
about
feet
as
it
was
very
easy
to
see
the
slightest
irregularity
on
this
perfectly
flat
surface
while
thus
engaged
we
had
an
opportunity
of
becoming
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
snow
often
very
often
indeed
on
this
part
of
the
plateau
to
the
south
of
we
had
difficulty
in
getting
snow
good
enough
that
is
solid
enough
for
cutting
blocks
the
snow
up
here
seemed
to
have
fallen
very
quietly
in
light
breezes
or
calms
we
could
thrust
the
which
was
feet
long
right
down
without
meeting
resistance
which
showed
that
there
was
no
hard
layer
of
snow
the
surface
was
also
perfectly
level
there
was
not
a
sign
of
sastrugi
in
any
direction
every
step
we
now
took
in
advance
brought
us
rapidly
nearer
the
goal
we
could
feel
fairly
certain
of
reaching
it
on
the
afternoon
of
the
it
was
very
natural
that
our
conversation
should
be
chiefly
concerned
with
the
time
of
arrival
none
of
us
would
admit
that
he
was
nervous
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
we
all
had
a
little
touch
of
that
malady
what
should
we
see
when
we
got
there
a
vast
endless
plain
that
no
eye
had
yet
seen
and
no
foot
yet
trodden
or
no
it
was
an
impossibility
with
the
speed
at
which
we
had
travelled
we
must
reach
the
goal
first
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
and
yet
and
yet
wherever
there
is
the
smallest
loophole
doubt
creeps
in
and
gnaws
and
gnaws
and
never
leaves
a
poor
wretch
in
peace
what
on
earth
is
uroa
scenting
it
was
bjaaland
who
made
this
remark
on
one
of
these
last
days
when
i
was
going
by
the
side
of
his
sledge
and
talking
to
him
and
the
strange
thing
is
that
he
scenting
to
the
south
it
can
never
be
mylius
ring
and
suggen
showed
the
same
interest
in
the
southerly
direction
it
was
quite
extraordinary
to
see
how
they
raised
their
heads
with
every
sign
of
curiosity
put
their
noses
in
the
air
and
sniffed
due
south
one
would
really
have
thought
there
was
something
remarkable
to
be
found
there
from
the
barometer
and
hypsometer
indicated
slowly
but
surely
that
the
plateau
was
beginning
to
descend
towards
the
other
side
this
was
a
pleasant
surprise
to
us
we
had
thus
not
only
found
the
very
summit
of
the
plateau
but
also
the
slope
down
on
the
far
side
this
would
have
a
very
important
bearing
for
obtaining
an
idea
of
the
construction
of
the
whole
plateau
on
december
observations
and
dead
reckoning
agreed
within
a
mile
the
same
result
again
on
the
observation
kilometres
behind
reckoning
the
weather
and
going
remained
about
the
same
as
on
the
preceding
days
light
breeze
temperature
the
snow
surface
was
loose
but
ski
and
sledges
glided
over
it
well
on
the
the
same
weather
conditions
temperature
observation
and
reckoning
again
agreed
exactly
our
latitude
was
on
the
we
reached
reckoning
kilometre
behind
observation
going
and
surface
as
good
as
ever
weather
splendid
calm
with
sunshine
the
noon
observation
on
the
gave
reckoning
we
halted
in
the
afternoon
after
going
eight
geographical
miles
and
camped
in
according
to
reckoning
the
weather
during
the
forenoon
had
been
just
as
fine
as
before
in
the
afternoon
we
had
some
from
the
it
was
like
the
eve
of
some
great
festival
that
night
in
the
tent
one
could
feel
that
a
great
event
was
at
hand
our
flag
was
taken
out
again
and
lashed
to
the
same
two
as
before
then
it
was
rolled
up
and
laid
aside
to
be
ready
when
the
time
came
i
was
awake
several
times
during
the
night
and
had
the
same
feeling
that
i
can
remember
as
a
little
boy
on
the
night
before
christmas
eve
an
intense
expectation
of
what
was
going
to
happen
otherwise
i
think
we
slept
just
as
well
that
night
as
any
other
on
the
morning
of
december
the
weather
was
of
the
finest
just
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
arriving
at
the
pole
i
am
not
quite
sure
but
i
believe
we
despatched
our
breakfast
rather
more
quickly
than
usual
and
were
out
of
the
tent
sooner
though
i
must
admit
that
we
always
accomplished
this
with
all
reasonable
haste
we
went
in
the
usual
order
the
forerunner
hanssen
wisting
bjaaland
and
the
reserve
forerunner
by
noon
we
had
reached
by
dead
reckoning
and
made
ready
to
take
the
rest
in
one
stage
at
a
light
breeze
had
sprung
up
from
the
and
it
had
clouded
over
so
that
we
got
no
noon
altitude
but
the
clouds
were
not
thick
and
from
time
to
time
we
had
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
through
them
the
going
on
that
day
was
rather
different
from
what
it
had
been
sometimes
the
ski
went
over
it
well
but
at
others
it
was
pretty
bad
we
advanced
that
day
in
the
same
mechanical
way
as
before
not
much
was
said
but
eyes
were
used
all
the
more
hanssen
neck
grew
twice
as
long
as
before
in
his
endeavour
to
see
a
few
inches
farther
i
had
asked
him
before
we
started
to
spy
out
ahead
for
all
he
was
worth
and
he
did
so
with
a
vengeance
but
however
keenly
he
stared
he
could
not
descry
anything
but
the
endless
flat
plain
ahead
of
us
the
dogs
had
dropped
their
scenting
and
appeared
to
have
lost
their
interest
in
the
regions
about
the
earth
axis
at
three
in
the
afternoon
a
simultaneous
halt
rang
out
from
the
drivers
they
had
carefully
examined
their
and
they
all
showed
the
full
distance
our
pole
by
reckoning
the
goal
was
reached
the
journey
ended
i
can
not
say
though
i
know
it
would
sound
much
more
effective
that
the
object
of
my
life
was
attained
that
would
be
romancing
rather
too
i
had
better
be
honest
and
admit
straight
out
that
i
have
never
known
any
man
to
be
placed
in
such
a
diametrically
opposite
position
to
the
goal
of
his
desires
as
i
was
at
that
moment
the
regions
around
the
north
pole
well
yes
the
north
pole
itself
had
attracted
me
from
childhood
and
here
i
was
at
the
south
pole
can
anything
more
be
imagined
we
reckoned
now
that
we
were
at
the
pole
of
course
every
one
of
us
knew
that
we
were
not
standing
on
the
absolute
spot
it
would
be
an
impossibility
with
the
time
and
the
instruments
at
our
disposal
to
ascertain
that
exact
spot
but
we
were
so
near
it
that
the
few
miles
which
possibly
separated
us
from
it
could
not
be
of
the
slightest
importance
it
was
our
intention
to
make
a
circle
round
this
camp
with
a
radius
of
twelve
and
a
half
miles
kilometres
and
to
be
satisfied
with
that
after
we
had
halted
we
collected
and
congratulated
each
other
we
had
good
grounds
for
mutual
respect
in
what
had
been
achieved
and
i
think
that
was
just
the
feeling
that
was
expressed
in
the
firm
and
powerful
grasps
of
the
fist
that
were
exchanged
after
this
we
proceeded
to
the
greatest
and
most
solemn
act
of
the
whole
journey
the
planting
of
our
flag
pride
and
affection
shone
in
the
five
pairs
of
eyes
that
gazed
upon
the
flag
as
it
unfurled
itself
with
a
sharp
crack
and
waved
over
the
pole
i
had
determined
that
the
act
of
planting
it
the
historic
event
should
be
equally
divided
among
us
all
it
was
not
for
one
man
to
do
this
it
was
for
all
who
had
staked
their
lives
in
the
struggle
and
held
together
through
thick
and
thin
this
was
the
only
way
in
which
i
could
show
my
gratitude
to
my
comrades
in
this
desolate
spot
i
could
see
that
they
understood
and
accepted
it
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
offered
five
fists
they
were
that
grasped
the
pole
raised
the
waving
flag
in
the
air
and
planted
it
as
the
first
at
the
geographical
south
pole
thus
we
plant
thee
beloved
flag
at
the
south
pole
and
give
to
the
plain
on
which
it
lies
the
name
of
king
haakon
vii
plateau
that
moment
will
certainly
be
remembered
by
all
of
us
who
stood
there
one
gets
out
of
the
way
of
protracted
ceremonies
in
those
regions
the
shorter
they
are
the
better
everyday
life
began
again
at
once
when
we
had
got
the
tent
up
hanssen
set
about
slaughtering
helge
and
it
was
hard
for
him
to
have
to
part
from
his
best
friend
helge
had
been
an
uncommonly
useful
and
dog
without
making
any
fuss
he
had
pulled
from
morning
to
night
and
had
been
a
shining
example
to
the
team
but
during
the
last
week
he
had
quite
fallen
away
and
on
our
arrival
at
the
pole
there
was
only
a
shadow
of
the
old
helge
left
he
was
only
a
drag
on
the
others
and
did
absolutely
no
work
one
blow
on
the
skull
and
helge
had
ceased
to
live
what
is
death
to
one
is
food
to
another
is
a
saying
that
can
scarcely
find
a
better
application
than
these
dog
meals
helge
was
portioned
out
on
the
spot
and
within
a
couple
of
hours
there
was
nothing
left
of
him
but
his
teeth
and
the
tuft
at
the
end
of
his
tail
this
was
the
second
of
our
eighteen
dogs
that
we
had
lost
the
major
one
of
wisting
fine
dogs
left
us
in
deg
and
never
returned
he
was
fearfully
worn
out
and
must
have
gone
away
to
die
we
now
had
sixteen
dogs
left
and
these
we
intended
to
divide
into
two
equal
teams
leaving
bjaaland
sledge
behind
of
course
there
was
a
festivity
in
the
tent
that
evening
not
that
champagne
corks
were
popping
and
wine
flowing
no
we
contented
ourselves
with
a
little
piece
of
seal
meat
each
and
it
tasted
well
and
did
us
good
there
was
no
other
sign
of
festival
indoors
outside
we
heard
the
flag
flapping
in
the
breeze
conversation
was
lively
in
the
tent
that
evening
and
we
talked
of
many
things
perhaps
too
our
thoughts
sent
messages
home
of
what
we
had
done
everything
we
had
with
us
had
now
to
be
marked
with
the
words
south
pole
and
the
date
to
serve
afterwards
as
souvenirs
wisting
proved
to
be
a
engraver
and
many
were
the
articles
he
had
to
mark
tobacco
in
the
form
of
smoke
had
hitherto
never
made
its
appearance
in
the
tent
from
time
to
time
i
had
seen
one
or
two
of
the
others
take
a
quid
but
now
these
things
were
to
be
altered
i
had
brought
with
me
an
old
briar
pipe
which
bore
inscriptions
from
many
places
in
the
arctic
regions
and
now
i
wanted
it
marked
south
pole
when
i
produced
my
pipe
and
was
about
to
mark
it
i
received
an
unexpected
gift
wisting
offered
me
tobacco
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
he
had
some
cakes
of
plug
in
his
which
he
would
prefer
to
see
me
smoke
can
anyone
grasp
what
such
an
offer
meant
at
such
a
spot
made
to
a
man
who
to
tell
the
truth
is
very
fond
of
a
smoke
after
meals
there
are
not
many
who
can
understand
it
fully
i
accepted
the
offer
jumping
with
joy
and
on
the
way
home
i
had
a
pipe
of
fresh
plug
every
evening
ah
that
wisting
he
spoiled
me
entirely
not
only
did
he
give
me
tobacco
but
every
evening
and
i
must
confess
i
yielded
to
the
temptation
after
a
while
and
had
a
morning
smoke
as
well
he
undertook
the
disagreeable
work
of
cutting
the
plug
and
filling
my
pipe
in
all
kinds
of
weather
but
we
did
not
let
our
talk
make
us
forget
other
things
as
we
had
got
no
noon
altitude
we
should
have
to
try
and
take
one
at
midnight
the
weather
had
brightened
again
and
it
looked
as
if
midnight
would
be
a
good
time
for
the
observation
we
therefore
crept
into
our
bags
to
get
a
little
nap
in
the
intervening
hours
in
good
time
soon
after
we
were
out
again
and
ready
to
catch
the
sun
the
weather
was
of
the
best
and
the
opportunity
excellent
we
four
navigators
all
had
a
share
in
it
as
usual
and
stood
watching
the
course
of
the
sun
this
was
a
labour
of
patience
as
the
difference
of
altitude
was
now
very
slight
the
result
at
which
we
finally
arrived
was
of
great
interest
as
it
clearly
shows
how
unreliable
and
valueless
a
single
observation
like
this
is
in
these
regions
at
we
put
our
instruments
away
well
satisfied
with
our
work
and
quite
convinced
that
it
was
the
midnight
altitude
that
we
had
observed
the
calculations
which
were
carried
out
immediately
afterwards
gave
us
we
were
all
well
pleased
with
this
result
the
arrangement
now
was
that
we
should
encircle
this
camp
with
a
radius
of
about
twelve
and
a
half
miles
by
encircling
i
do
not
of
course
mean
that
we
should
go
round
in
a
circle
with
this
radius
that
would
have
taken
us
days
and
was
not
to
be
thought
of
the
encircling
was
accomplished
in
this
way
three
men
went
out
in
three
different
directions
two
at
right
angles
to
the
course
we
had
been
steering
and
one
in
continuation
of
that
course
to
carry
out
this
work
i
had
chosen
wisting
hassel
and
bjaaland
having
concluded
our
observations
we
put
the
kettle
on
to
give
ourselves
a
drop
of
chocolate
the
pleasure
of
standing
out
there
in
rather
light
attire
had
not
exactly
put
warmth
into
our
bodies
as
we
were
engaged
in
swallowing
the
scalding
drink
bjaaland
suddenly
observed
i
like
to
tackle
this
encircling
straight
away
we
shall
have
lots
of
time
to
sleep
when
we
get
back
hassel
and
wisting
were
quite
of
the
same
opinion
and
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
start
the
work
immediately
here
we
have
yet
another
example
of
the
good
spirit
that
prevailed
in
our
little
community
we
had
only
lately
come
in
from
our
day
work
a
march
of
about
eighteen
and
a
half
miles
and
now
they
were
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
on
another
miles
it
seemed
as
if
these
fellows
could
never
be
tired
we
therefore
turned
this
meal
into
a
little
breakfast
that
is
to
say
each
man
ate
what
he
wanted
of
his
bread
ration
and
then
they
began
to
get
ready
for
the
work
first
three
small
bags
of
light
windproof
stuff
were
made
and
in
each
of
these
was
placed
a
paper
giving
the
position
of
our
camp
in
addition
each
of
them
carried
a
large
square
flag
of
the
same
dark
brown
material
which
could
be
easily
seen
at
a
distance
as
we
elected
to
use
our
spare
which
were
both
long
feet
and
strong
and
which
we
were
going
to
take
off
here
in
any
case
to
lighten
the
sledges
as
much
as
possible
for
the
return
journey
thus
equipped
and
with
thirty
biscuits
as
an
extra
ration
the
three
men
started
off
in
the
directions
laid
down
their
march
was
by
no
means
free
from
danger
and
does
great
honour
to
those
who
undertook
it
not
merely
without
raising
the
smallest
objection
but
with
the
greatest
keenness
let
us
consider
for
a
moment
the
risk
they
ran
our
tent
on
the
boundless
plain
without
marks
of
any
kind
may
very
well
be
compared
with
a
needle
in
a
haystack
from
this
the
three
men
were
to
steer
out
for
a
distance
of
twelve
and
a
half
miles
compasses
would
have
been
good
things
to
take
on
such
a
walk
but
our
were
too
heavy
and
unsuitable
for
carrying
they
therefore
had
to
go
without
they
had
the
sun
to
go
by
certainly
when
they
started
but
who
could
say
how
long
it
would
last
the
weather
was
then
fine
enough
but
it
was
impossible
to
guarantee
that
no
sudden
change
would
take
place
if
by
bad
luck
the
sun
should
be
hidden
then
their
own
tracks
might
help
them
but
to
trust
to
tracks
in
these
regions
is
a
dangerous
thing
before
you
know
where
you
are
the
whole
plain
may
be
one
mass
of
driving
snow
obliterating
all
tracks
as
soon
as
they
are
made
with
the
rapid
changes
of
weather
we
had
so
often
experienced
such
a
thing
was
not
impossible
that
these
three
risked
their
lives
that
morning
when
they
left
the
tent
at
there
can
be
no
doubt
at
all
and
they
all
three
knew
it
very
well
but
if
anyone
thinks
that
on
this
account
they
took
a
solemn
farewell
of
us
who
stayed
behind
he
is
much
mistaken
not
a
bit
they
all
vanished
in
their
different
directions
amid
laughter
and
chaff
the
first
thing
we
did
hanssen
and
i
was
to
set
about
arranging
a
lot
of
trifling
matters
there
was
something
to
be
done
here
something
there
and
above
all
we
had
to
be
ready
for
the
series
of
observations
we
were
to
carry
out
together
so
as
to
get
as
accurate
a
determination
of
our
position
as
possible
the
first
observation
told
us
at
once
how
necessary
this
was
for
it
turned
out
that
this
instead
of
giving
us
a
greater
altitude
than
the
midnight
observation
gave
us
a
smaller
one
and
it
was
then
clear
that
we
had
gone
out
of
the
meridian
we
thought
we
were
following
now
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
our
north
and
south
line
and
latitude
determined
so
that
we
could
find
our
position
once
more
luckily
for
us
the
weather
looked
as
if
it
would
hold
we
measured
the
sun
altitude
at
every
hour
from
to
and
from
these
observations
found
with
some
degree
of
certainty
our
latitude
and
the
direction
of
the
meridian
by
nine
in
the
morning
we
began
to
expect
the
return
of
our
comrades
according
to
our
calculation
they
should
then
have
covered
the
distance
miles
it
was
not
till
ten
that
hanssen
made
out
the
first
black
dot
on
the
horizon
and
not
long
after
the
second
and
third
appeared
we
both
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
as
they
came
on
almost
simultaneously
the
three
arrived
at
the
tent
we
told
them
the
result
of
our
observations
up
to
that
time
it
looked
as
if
our
camp
was
in
about
and
that
with
our
encircling
we
had
therefore
included
the
actual
pole
with
this
result
we
might
very
well
have
been
content
but
as
the
weather
was
so
good
and
gave
the
impression
that
it
would
continue
so
and
our
store
of
provisions
proved
on
examination
to
be
very
ample
we
decided
to
go
on
for
the
remaining
ten
kilometres
five
and
a
half
geographical
miles
and
get
our
position
determined
as
near
to
the
pole
as
possible
meanwhile
the
three
wanderers
turned
in
not
so
much
because
they
were
tired
as
because
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
and
hanssen
and
i
continued
the
series
of
observations
in
the
afternoon
we
again
went
very
carefully
through
our
provision
supply
before
discussing
the
future
the
result
was
that
we
had
food
enough
for
ourselves
and
the
dogs
for
eighteen
days
the
surviving
sixteen
dogs
were
divided
into
two
teams
of
eight
each
and
the
contents
of
bjaaland
sledge
were
shared
between
hanssen
and
wisting
the
abandoned
sledge
was
set
upright
in
the
snow
and
proved
to
be
a
splendid
mark
the
was
screwed
to
the
sledge
and
we
left
it
there
our
other
two
were
quite
sufficient
for
the
return
journey
they
had
all
shown
themselves
very
accurate
a
couple
of
empty
provision
cases
were
also
left
behind
i
wrote
in
pencil
on
a
piece
of
case
the
information
that
our
tent
polheim
would
be
found
five
and
a
half
geographical
miles
quarter
west
by
compass
from
the
sledge
having
put
all
these
things
in
order
the
same
day
we
turned
in
very
well
satisfied
early
next
morning
december
we
were
on
our
feet
again
bjaaland
who
had
now
left
the
company
of
the
drivers
and
been
received
with
jubilation
into
that
of
the
forerunners
was
immediately
entrusted
with
the
honourable
task
of
leading
the
expedition
forward
to
the
pole
itself
i
assigned
this
duty
which
we
all
regarded
as
a
distinction
to
him
as
a
mark
of
gratitude
to
the
gallant
telemarkers
for
their
work
in
the
advancement
of
ski
spot
the
leader
that
day
had
to
keep
as
straight
as
a
line
and
if
possible
to
follow
the
direction
of
our
meridian
a
little
way
after
bjaaland
came
hassel
then
hanssen
then
wisting
and
i
followed
a
good
way
behind
i
could
thus
check
the
direction
of
the
march
very
accurately
and
see
that
no
great
deviation
was
made
bjaaland
on
this
occasion
showed
himself
a
matchless
forerunner
he
went
perfectly
straight
the
whole
time
not
once
did
he
incline
to
one
side
or
the
other
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
distance
we
could
still
clearly
see
the
sledge
we
had
set
up
and
take
its
bearing
this
showed
it
to
be
absolutely
in
the
right
direction
it
was
when
we
reached
our
destination
while
some
of
us
were
putting
up
the
tent
others
began
to
get
everything
ready
for
the
coming
observations
a
solid
snow
pedestal
was
put
up
on
which
the
artificial
horizon
was
to
be
placed
and
a
smaller
one
to
rest
the
sextant
on
when
it
was
not
in
use
at
the
first
observation
was
taken
we
divided
ourselves
into
two
parties
hanssen
and
i
in
one
hassel
and
wisting
in
the
other
while
one
party
slept
the
other
took
the
observations
and
the
watches
were
of
six
hours
each
the
weather
was
altogether
grand
though
the
sky
was
not
perfectly
bright
the
whole
time
a
very
light
fine
vaporous
curtain
would
spread
across
the
sky
from
time
to
time
and
then
quickly
disappear
again
this
film
of
cloud
was
not
thick
enough
to
hide
the
sun
which
we
could
see
the
whole
time
but
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
be
disturbed
the
effect
of
this
was
that
the
sun
appeared
not
to
change
its
altitude
for
several
hours
until
it
suddenly
made
a
jump
observations
were
now
taken
every
hour
through
the
whole
it
was
very
strange
to
turn
in
at
and
then
on
turning
out
again
at
midnight
to
find
the
sun
apparently
still
at
the
same
altitude
and
then
once
more
at
to
see
it
still
no
higher
the
altitude
had
changed
of
course
but
so
slightly
that
it
was
imperceptible
with
the
naked
eye
to
us
it
appeared
as
though
the
sun
made
the
circuit
of
the
heavens
at
exactly
the
same
altitude
the
times
of
day
that
i
have
given
here
are
calculated
according
to
the
meridian
of
framheim
we
continued
to
reckon
our
time
from
this
the
observations
soon
told
us
that
we
were
not
on
the
absolute
pole
but
as
close
to
it
as
we
could
hope
to
get
with
our
instruments
the
observations
which
have
been
submitted
to
anton
alexander
will
be
published
and
the
result
given
later
in
this
book
on
december
at
noon
we
had
completed
our
observations
and
it
is
certain
that
we
had
done
all
that
could
be
done
in
order
if
possible
to
come
a
few
inches
nearer
to
the
actual
pole
hanssen
and
bjaaland
went
out
four
geographical
miles
seven
kilometres
in
the
direction
of
the
newly
found
meridian
bjaaland
astonished
me
at
dinner
that
day
speeches
had
not
hitherto
been
a
feature
of
this
journey
but
now
bjaaland
evidently
thought
the
time
had
come
and
surprised
us
all
with
a
really
fine
oration
my
amazement
reached
its
culmination
when
at
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
he
produced
a
full
of
cigars
and
offered
it
round
a
cigar
at
the
pole
what
do
you
say
to
that
but
it
did
not
end
there
when
the
cigars
had
gone
round
there
were
still
four
left
i
was
quite
touched
when
he
handed
the
case
and
cigars
to
me
with
the
words
keep
this
to
remind
you
of
the
pole
i
have
taken
good
care
of
the
case
and
shall
preserve
it
as
one
of
the
many
happy
signs
of
my
comrades
devotion
on
this
journey
the
cigars
i
shared
out
afterwards
on
christmas
eve
and
they
gave
us
a
visible
mark
of
that
occasion
when
this
festival
dinner
at
the
pole
was
ended
we
began
our
preparations
for
departure
first
we
set
up
the
little
tent
we
had
brought
with
us
in
case
we
should
be
compelled
to
divide
into
two
parties
it
had
been
made
by
our
able
sailmaker
rionne
and
was
of
very
thin
windproof
gabardine
its
drab
colour
made
it
easily
visible
against
the
white
surface
another
pole
was
lashed
to
the
making
its
total
height
about
feet
on
the
top
of
this
a
little
norwegian
flag
was
lashed
fast
and
underneath
it
a
pennant
on
which
fram
was
painted
the
tent
was
well
secured
with
on
all
sides
inside
the
tent
in
a
little
bag
i
left
a
letter
addressed
to
the
king
giving
information
of
what
we
had
accomplished
the
way
home
was
a
long
one
and
so
many
things
might
happen
to
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
give
an
account
of
our
expedition
besides
this
letter
i
wrote
a
short
epistle
to
captain
scott
who
i
assumed
would
be
the
first
to
find
the
tent
other
things
we
left
there
were
a
sextant
with
a
glass
horizon
a
hypsometer
case
three
some
kamiks
and
mits
when
everything
had
been
laid
inside
we
went
into
the
tent
one
by
one
to
write
our
names
on
a
tablet
we
had
fastened
to
the
on
this
occasion
we
received
the
congratulations
of
our
companions
on
the
successful
result
for
the
following
messages
were
written
on
a
couple
of
strips
of
leather
sewed
to
the
tent
good
luck
and
welcome
to
these
good
wishes
which
we
suddenly
discovered
put
us
in
very
good
spirits
they
were
signed
by
beck
and
rönne
they
had
good
faith
in
us
when
we
had
finished
this
we
came
out
and
the
was
securely
laced
together
so
that
there
was
no
danger
of
the
wind
getting
a
hold
on
that
side
and
so
to
polheim
it
was
a
solemn
moment
when
we
bared
our
heads
and
bade
farewell
to
our
home
and
our
flag
and
then
the
travelling
tent
was
taken
down
and
the
sledges
packed
now
the
homeward
journey
was
to
begin
homeward
step
by
step
mile
after
mile
until
the
whole
distance
was
accomplished
we
drove
at
once
into
our
old
tracks
and
followed
them
many
were
the
times
we
turned
to
send
a
last
look
to
polheim
the
vaporous
white
air
set
in
again
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
last
of
polheim
our
little
flag
disappeared
from
view
chapter
xiii
the
return
to
framheim
the
going
was
splendid
and
all
were
in
good
spirits
so
we
went
along
at
a
great
pace
one
would
almost
have
thought
the
dogs
knew
they
were
homeward
bound
a
mild
wind
with
a
temperature
of
was
our
last
greeting
from
the
pole
when
we
came
to
our
last
camp
where
the
sledge
was
left
we
stopped
and
took
a
few
things
with
us
from
this
point
we
came
into
the
line
of
beacons
our
tracks
had
already
become
very
indistinct
but
thanks
to
his
excellent
sight
bjaaland
kept
in
them
quite
well
the
beacons
however
served
their
purpose
so
satisfactorily
that
the
tracks
were
almost
superfluous
although
these
beacons
were
not
more
than
about
feet
high
they
were
extremely
conspicuous
on
the
level
surface
when
the
sun
was
on
them
they
shone
like
electric
lighthouses
and
when
the
sun
was
on
the
other
side
they
looked
so
dark
in
the
shadow
that
one
would
have
taken
them
for
black
rocks
we
intended
in
future
to
travel
at
night
the
advantages
of
this
were
many
and
great
in
the
first
place
we
should
have
the
sun
behind
us
which
meant
a
good
deal
to
our
eyes
going
against
the
sun
on
a
snow
surface
like
this
tells
fearfully
on
the
eyes
even
if
one
has
good
but
with
the
sun
at
one
back
it
is
only
play
another
great
advantage
which
we
did
not
reap
till
later
was
that
it
gave
us
the
warmest
part
of
the
hours
in
the
tent
during
which
time
we
had
an
opportunity
of
drying
wet
clothes
and
so
on
this
last
advantage
was
however
a
doubtful
one
as
we
shall
see
in
due
course
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
turn
our
backs
to
the
south
the
wind
which
had
nearly
always
been
in
this
quarter
had
often
been
very
painful
to
our
cracked
faces
now
we
should
always
have
it
at
our
backs
and
it
would
help
us
on
our
way
besides
giving
our
faces
time
to
heal
another
thing
we
were
longing
for
was
to
come
down
to
the
barrier
again
so
that
we
could
breathe
freely
up
here
we
were
seldom
able
to
draw
a
good
long
breath
if
we
only
had
to
say
yes
we
had
to
do
it
in
two
instalments
the
asthmatic
condition
in
which
we
found
ourselves
during
our
six
weeks
stay
on
the
plateau
was
anything
but
pleasant
we
had
fixed
fifteen
geographical
miles
seventeen
and
statute
miles
as
a
suitable
day
march
on
the
homeward
journey
we
had
of
course
many
advantages
now
as
compared
with
the
southward
journey
which
would
have
enabled
us
to
do
longer
marches
than
this
but
we
were
afraid
of
overworking
the
dogs
and
possibly
using
them
up
before
we
had
gone
very
far
if
we
attempted
too
great
a
distance
daily
it
soon
proved
however
that
we
had
underestimated
our
dogs
powers
it
only
took
us
five
hours
to
cover
the
appointed
distance
and
our
rest
was
therefore
a
long
one
on
december
we
killed
the
first
dog
on
the
homeward
trip
this
was
lasse
my
own
favourite
dog
he
had
worn
himself
out
completely
and
was
no
longer
worth
anything
he
was
divided
into
fifteen
portions
as
nearly
equal
as
possible
and
given
to
his
companions
they
had
now
learnt
to
set
great
store
by
fresh
meat
and
it
is
certain
that
the
extra
feeds
like
this
one
that
took
place
from
time
to
time
on
the
way
home
had
no
small
share
in
the
remarkably
successful
result
they
seemed
to
benefit
by
these
meals
of
fresh
meat
for
several
days
afterwards
and
worked
much
more
easily
december
began
with
bitter
weather
a
breeze
from
the
grey
and
thick
we
lost
the
trail
and
for
some
time
had
to
go
by
compass
but
as
usual
it
suddenly
cleared
and
once
more
the
plain
lay
before
us
light
and
warm
yes
too
warm
it
was
we
had
to
take
off
everything
nearly
and
still
the
sweat
poured
off
us
it
was
not
for
long
that
we
were
uncertain
of
the
way
our
excellent
beacons
did
us
brilliant
service
and
one
after
another
they
came
up
on
the
horizon
flashed
and
shone
and
drew
us
on
to
our
depot
in
we
were
now
going
slightly
uphill
but
so
slightly
that
it
was
unnoticeable
the
hypsometer
and
barometer
however
were
not
to
be
deceived
and
both
fell
in
precisely
the
same
degree
as
they
had
risen
before
even
if
we
had
not
exactly
noticed
the
rise
the
feeling
of
it
was
present
it
may
perhaps
be
called
imagination
but
i
certainly
thought
i
could
notice
the
rise
by
my
breathing
our
appetite
had
increased
alarmingly
during
the
last
few
days
it
appeared
that
we
evinced
a
far
greater
voracity
than
the
drivers
there
were
days
only
a
few
days
be
it
said
when
i
believe
any
of
us
three
bjaaland
hassel
and
myself
would
have
swallowed
pebbles
without
winking
the
drivers
never
showed
such
signs
of
starvation
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
this
may
possibly
have
been
due
to
their
being
able
to
lean
on
the
sledges
as
they
went
along
and
thus
have
a
rest
and
support
which
we
had
to
do
without
it
seems
little
enough
simply
to
rest
one
hand
on
a
sledge
on
the
march
but
in
the
long
run
day
after
day
it
may
perhaps
make
itself
felt
fortunately
we
were
so
well
supplied
that
when
this
sensation
of
hunger
came
over
us
we
could
increase
our
daily
rations
on
leaving
the
pole
we
added
to
our
pemmican
ration
with
the
result
that
our
appetites
soon
gave
way
and
shrank
to
an
ordinary
good
everyday
twist
our
daily
programme
on
entering
upon
the
return
journey
was
so
arranged
that
we
began
to
get
breakfast
ready
at
and
by
we
were
usually
quite
ready
to
start
the
day
march
an
hour
or
so
after
midnight
the
fifteen
geographical
miles
were
accomplished
and
we
could
once
more
put
up
our
tent
cook
our
food
and
seek
our
rest
but
this
rest
soon
became
so
insufferably
long
and
then
there
was
the
fearful
heat
considering
the
circumstances
which
often
made
us
get
out
of
our
and
lie
with
nothing
over
us
these
rests
of
twelve
fourteen
sometimes
as
much
as
sixteen
hours
were
what
most
tried
our
patience
during
the
early
part
of
the
return
journey
we
could
see
so
well
that
all
this
rest
was
unnecessary
but
still
we
kept
it
up
as
long
as
we
were
on
the
high
ground
our
conversation
at
this
time
used
to
turn
very
often
on
the
best
way
of
filling
up
these
long
unnecessary
waits
that
day
december
per
good
faithful
conscientious
per
broke
down
utterly
and
had
to
be
taken
on
the
sledge
the
last
part
of
the
way
on
arrival
at
the
he
had
his
reward
a
little
blow
of
the
back
of
the
axe
was
enough
for
him
without
making
a
sound
the
animal
collapsed
in
him
wisting
lost
one
of
his
best
dogs
he
was
a
curious
animal
always
went
about
quietly
and
peaceably
and
never
took
part
in
the
others
battles
from
his
looks
and
behaviour
one
would
have
judged
him
quite
mistakenly
to
be
a
queer
sort
of
beast
who
was
good
for
nothing
but
when
he
was
in
harness
he
showed
what
he
could
do
without
needing
any
shouts
or
cuts
of
the
whip
he
put
himself
into
it
from
morning
to
night
and
was
priceless
as
a
draught
dog
but
like
others
of
the
same
character
he
could
not
keep
it
going
any
longer
he
collapsed
was
killed
and
eaten
christmas
eve
was
rapidly
approaching
for
us
it
could
not
be
particularly
festive
but
we
should
have
to
try
to
make
as
much
of
it
as
circumstances
would
permit
we
ought
therefore
to
reach
our
depot
that
evening
so
as
to
keep
christmas
with
a
dish
of
porridge
the
night
before
christmas
eve
we
slaughtered
svartflekken
there
was
no
mourning
on
this
occasion
svartflekken
was
one
of
hassel
dogs
and
had
always
been
a
reprobate
i
find
the
following
in
my
diary
written
the
same
evening
slaughtered
svartflekken
this
evening
he
would
not
do
any
more
although
there
was
not
much
wrong
with
his
looks
bad
character
if
a
man
he
would
have
ended
in
penal
servitude
he
was
comparatively
fat
and
was
consumed
with
evident
satisfaction
christmas
eve
came
the
weather
was
rather
changeable
now
overcast
now
clear
when
we
set
out
at
the
night
before
we
had
not
far
to
go
before
reaching
our
depot
at
midnight
we
arrived
there
in
the
most
glorious
weather
calm
and
warm
now
we
had
the
whole
of
christmas
eve
before
us
and
could
enjoy
it
at
our
ease
our
depot
was
at
once
taken
down
and
divided
between
the
two
sledges
all
crumbs
of
biscuit
were
carefully
collected
by
wisting
the
cook
for
the
day
and
put
into
a
bag
this
was
taken
into
the
tent
and
vigorously
beaten
and
kneaded
the
result
was
pulverized
biscuit
with
this
product
and
a
sausage
of
dried
milk
wisting
succeeded
in
making
a
capital
dish
of
christmas
porridge
i
doubt
whether
anyone
at
home
enjoyed
his
christmas
dinner
so
much
as
we
did
that
morning
in
the
tent
one
of
bjaaland
cigars
to
follow
brought
a
festival
spirit
over
the
whole
camp
another
thing
we
had
to
rejoice
about
that
day
was
that
we
had
again
reached
the
summit
of
the
plateau
and
after
two
or
three
more
march
would
begin
to
go
downhill
finally
reaching
the
barrier
and
our
old
haunts
our
daily
march
had
hitherto
been
interrupted
by
one
or
two
halts
we
stopped
to
rest
both
the
dogs
and
ourselves
on
christmas
eve
we
instituted
a
new
order
of
things
and
did
the
whole
distance
fifteen
geographical
miles
without
a
stop
we
liked
this
arrangement
best
after
all
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
dogs
did
the
same
as
a
rule
it
was
hard
to
begin
the
march
again
after
the
rest
one
got
rather
stiff
lazy
too
perhaps
and
had
to
become
supple
again
on
the
we
passed
going
well
the
surface
appeared
to
have
been
exposed
to
powerful
sunshine
since
we
left
it
as
it
had
become
quite
polished
going
over
these
polished
levels
was
like
crossing
smooth
ice
but
with
the
important
difference
that
here
the
dogs
had
a
good
foothold
this
time
we
sighted
high
land
even
in
and
it
had
great
surprises
in
store
for
us
it
was
clear
that
this
was
the
same
mighty
range
running
to
the
as
we
had
seen
before
but
this
time
it
stretched
considerably
farther
to
the
south
the
weather
was
radiantly
clear
and
we
could
see
by
the
land
that
the
range
of
vision
was
very
great
summit
after
summit
the
range
extended
to
the
until
it
gradually
disappeared
but
to
judge
from
the
atmosphere
it
was
continued
beyond
our
range
of
vision
in
the
same
direction
that
this
chain
traverses
the
antarctic
continent
i
therefore
consider
beyond
a
doubt
here
we
had
a
very
good
example
of
how
deceptive
the
atmosphere
is
in
these
regions
on
a
day
that
appeared
perfectly
clear
we
had
lost
sight
of
the
mountains
in
and
now
we
saw
them
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
that
we
were
astonished
is
a
mild
expression
we
looked
and
looked
entirely
unable
to
recognize
our
position
little
did
we
guess
that
the
huge
that
stood
up
so
high
and
clear
on
the
horizon
was
mount
thorvald
nilsen
how
utterly
different
it
had
looked
in
the
misty
air
when
we
said
to
it
it
is
amusing
to
read
my
diary
of
this
time
and
see
how
persistently
we
took
the
bearings
of
land
every
day
and
thought
it
was
new
we
did
not
recognize
that
vast
mountain
until
mount
helmer
hanssen
began
to
stick
up
out
of
the
plain
on
december
we
left
the
summit
of
the
plateau
and
began
the
descent
although
the
incline
was
not
perceptible
to
the
naked
eye
its
effect
could
easily
be
seen
in
the
dogs
wisting
now
used
a
sail
on
his
sledge
and
was
thus
able
to
keep
up
with
hanssen
if
anyone
had
seen
the
procession
that
came
marching
over
the
plateau
at
that
time
he
would
hardly
have
thought
we
had
been
out
for
seventy
days
at
a
stretch
for
we
came
at
a
swinging
pace
we
always
had
the
wind
at
our
backs
with
sunshine
and
warmth
the
whole
time
there
was
never
a
thought
of
using
the
whip
now
the
dogs
were
bursting
with
health
and
tugged
at
their
harness
to
get
away
it
was
a
hard
time
for
our
worthy
forerunner
he
often
had
to
spurt
as
much
as
he
could
to
keep
clear
of
hanssen
dogs
wisting
in
full
sail
with
his
dogs
howling
for
joy
came
close
behind
hassel
had
his
work
cut
out
to
follow
and
indeed
i
had
the
same
the
surface
was
absolutely
polished
and
for
long
stretches
at
a
time
we
could
push
ourselves
along
with
our
sticks
the
dogs
were
completely
changed
since
we
had
left
the
pole
strange
as
it
may
sound
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
they
were
putting
on
flesh
day
by
day
and
getting
quite
fat
i
believe
it
must
have
been
feeding
them
on
fresh
meat
and
pemmican
together
that
did
this
we
were
again
able
to
increase
our
ration
of
pemmican
from
december
the
daily
ration
was
pound
grams
per
man
and
we
could
not
manage
more
at
least
i
think
not
on
december
we
went
downhill
more
and
more
and
it
was
indeed
tough
work
being
a
the
drivers
stood
so
jauntily
by
the
side
of
their
sledges
letting
themselves
be
carried
over
the
plain
at
a
phenomenal
pace
the
surface
consisted
of
sastrugi
alternating
with
smooth
stretches
like
ice
heaven
help
me
how
we
had
to
struggle
to
keep
up
it
was
all
very
well
for
bjaaland
he
had
flown
faster
on
even
worse
ground
but
for
hassel
and
me
it
was
different
i
saw
hassel
put
out
now
an
arm
now
a
leg
and
make
the
most
desperate
efforts
to
keep
on
his
feet
fortunately
i
could
not
see
myself
if
i
had
been
able
to
i
am
sure
i
should
have
been
in
fits
of
laughter
early
that
day
mount
helmer
hanssen
appeared
the
ground
now
went
in
great
undulations
a
thing
we
had
not
noticed
in
the
mist
when
we
were
going
south
so
high
were
these
undulations
that
they
suddenly
hid
the
view
from
us
the
first
we
saw
of
mount
hanssen
was
from
the
top
of
one
of
these
big
waves
it
then
looked
like
the
top
of
a
pressure
hummock
that
was
just
sticking
up
above
the
surface
at
first
we
did
not
understand
at
all
what
it
was
it
was
not
till
the
next
day
that
we
really
grasped
it
when
the
pointed
blocks
of
ice
covering
the
top
of
the
mountain
came
into
view
as
i
have
said
it
was
only
then
that
we
made
sure
of
being
on
the
right
course
all
the
rest
of
the
land
that
we
saw
was
so
entirely
strange
to
us
we
recognized
absolutely
nothing
on
the
we
passed
and
were
thus
rapidly
nearing
the
ballroom
and
glacier
the
next
day
was
brilliantly
with
a
good
breeze
right
aft
to
our
great
joy
we
got
sight
of
the
land
around
the
butcher
shop
it
was
still
a
long
way
off
of
course
but
was
miraged
up
in
the
warm
sunny
air
we
were
extraordinarily
lucky
on
our
homeward
trip
we
escaped
the
ballroom
altogether
on
january
we
ought
according
to
our
reckoning
to
reach
the
glacier
and
this
held
good
we
could
see
it
at
a
great
distance
huge
hummocks
and
towered
into
the
sky
but
what
astonished
us
was
that
between
these
disturbances
and
on
the
far
side
of
them
we
seemed
to
see
an
even
unbroken
plain
entirely
unaffected
by
the
broken
surface
mounts
hassel
wisting
and
bjaaland
lay
as
we
had
left
them
they
were
easy
to
recognize
when
we
came
a
little
nearer
to
them
now
mount
helmer
hanssen
again
towered
high
into
the
air
it
flashed
and
sparkled
like
diamonds
as
it
lay
bathed
in
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
we
assumed
that
we
had
come
nearer
to
this
range
than
when
we
were
going
south
and
that
this
was
the
reason
of
our
finding
the
ground
so
changed
when
we
were
going
south
it
certainly
looked
impassable
between
us
and
the
mountains
but
who
could
tell
perhaps
in
the
middle
of
all
the
broken
ground
that
we
then
saw
there
was
a
good
even
stretch
and
that
we
had
now
been
lucky
enough
to
stumble
upon
it
but
it
was
once
more
the
atmosphere
that
deceived
us
as
we
found
out
on
the
following
day
for
instead
of
being
nearer
the
range
we
had
come
farther
out
from
it
and
this
was
the
reason
of
our
only
getting
a
little
strip
of
this
undesirable
glacier
we
had
our
camp
that
evening
in
the
middle
of
a
big
crevasse
we
were
a
trifle
anxious
as
to
what
kind
of
surface
we
should
find
farther
on
that
these
few
hummocks
and
old
crevasses
were
all
the
glacier
had
to
offer
us
this
time
was
more
than
we
dared
to
hope
but
the
came
and
brought
thank
god
no
disappointment
with
incredible
luck
we
had
slipped
past
all
those
ugly
and
dangerous
places
and
now
before
we
knew
where
we
were
we
found
ourselves
safe
and
sound
on
the
plain
below
the
glacier
the
weather
was
not
when
we
started
at
seven
in
the
evening
it
was
fairly
thick
and
we
could
only
just
distinguish
the
top
of
mount
bjaaland
this
was
bad
as
we
were
now
in
the
neighbourhood
of
our
depot
and
would
have
liked
clear
weather
to
find
out
where
it
lay
but
instead
of
clearing
as
we
hoped
it
grew
thicker
and
thicker
and
when
we
had
gone
about
six
and
miles
it
was
so
bad
that
we
thought
it
best
to
stop
and
wait
for
a
while
we
had
all
the
time
been
going
on
the
erroneous
assumption
that
we
had
come
too
far
to
the
is
too
near
the
mountains
and
under
the
circumstances
in
the
short
gleams
that
had
come
from
time
to
time
we
had
not
been
able
to
recognize
the
ground
below
the
glacier
according
to
our
idea
we
were
on
the
east
of
the
depot
the
bearings
which
had
been
taken
in
thick
air
and
were
now
to
guide
us
in
this
heavy
mist
gave
no
result
whatever
there
was
no
depot
to
be
seen
we
had
just
swallowed
the
grateful
warm
pemmican
when
the
sun
suddenly
showed
itself
i
do
think
the
camp
was
ever
broken
and
the
sledges
packed
in
such
a
short
time
from
the
moment
we
jumped
out
of
our
bags
till
the
sledges
were
ready
it
only
took
us
fifteen
minutes
which
is
incredibly
quick
what
on
earth
is
that
shining
over
there
through
the
fog
the
question
came
from
one
of
the
lads
the
mist
had
divided
and
was
rolling
away
on
both
sides
in
the
western
bank
something
big
and
white
peeped
through
along
ridge
running
north
and
south
hurrah
it
helland
hansen
ca
possibly
be
anything
else
our
only
landmark
on
the
west
we
all
shouted
with
joy
on
meeting
this
old
acquaintance
but
in
the
direction
of
the
depot
the
fog
hung
thick
we
held
a
brief
consultation
and
agreed
to
let
it
go
to
steer
for
the
butcher
and
put
on
the
pace
we
had
food
enough
anyhow
no
sooner
said
than
done
and
we
started
off
it
rapidly
cleared
and
then
on
our
way
towards
helland
hansen
we
found
out
that
we
had
come
not
too
far
to
the
east
but
too
far
to
the
west
but
to
turn
round
and
begin
to
search
for
our
depot
was
not
to
our
liking
below
mount
helland
hansen
we
came
up
on
a
fairly
high
ridge
we
had
now
gone
our
fixed
distance
and
so
halted
behind
us
in
the
brightest
clearest
weather
lay
the
glacier
as
we
had
seen
it
for
the
first
time
on
our
way
to
the
south
break
after
break
crevasse
after
crevasse
but
in
among
all
this
nastiness
there
ran
a
white
unbroken
line
the
very
path
we
had
stood
and
looked
at
a
few
weeks
back
and
directly
below
that
white
stripe
we
knew
as
sure
as
anything
could
be
that
our
depot
lay
we
stood
there
expressing
our
annoyance
rather
forcibly
at
the
depot
having
escaped
us
so
easily
and
talking
of
how
jolly
it
would
have
been
to
have
picked
up
all
our
depots
from
the
plain
we
had
strewed
them
over
dead
tired
as
i
felt
that
evening
i
had
not
the
least
desire
to
go
back
the
fifteen
miles
that
separated
us
from
it
if
anybody
would
like
to
make
the
trip
he
shall
have
many
thanks
they
all
wanted
to
make
it
all
as
one
man
there
was
no
lack
of
volunteers
in
that
company
i
chose
hanssen
and
bjaaland
they
took
nearly
everything
off
the
sledge
and
went
away
with
it
empty
it
was
then
five
in
the
morning
at
three
in
the
afternoon
they
came
back
to
the
tent
bjaaland
running
in
front
hanssen
driving
the
sedge
that
was
a
notable
feat
both
for
men
and
dogs
hanssen
bjaaland
and
that
team
had
covered
about
fifty
miles
that
day
at
an
average
rate
of
three
to
three
and
a
half
miles
an
hour
they
had
found
the
depot
without
much
search
their
greatest
difficulty
had
been
in
the
undulating
surface
for
long
stretches
at
a
time
they
were
in
the
hollows
between
the
waves
which
shut
in
their
view
entirely
ridge
succeeded
ridge
endlessly
we
had
taken
care
that
everything
was
ready
for
their
return
above
all
great
quantities
of
water
water
water
was
the
first
thing
and
generally
the
last
that
was
in
request
when
their
thirst
was
a
little
quenched
great
interest
was
shown
in
the
pemmican
while
these
two
were
being
well
looked
after
the
depot
they
had
brought
in
was
divided
between
the
two
sledges
and
in
a
short
time
all
was
ready
for
our
departure
meanwhile
the
weather
had
been
getting
finer
and
finer
and
before
us
lay
the
mountains
sharp
and
clear
we
thought
we
recognized
fridtjof
nansen
and
don
pedro
christophersen
and
took
good
bearings
of
them
in
case
the
fog
should
return
with
most
of
us
the
ideas
of
day
and
night
began
to
get
rather
mixed
six
someone
would
answer
when
asked
the
time
yes
in
the
morning
remarks
the
other
no
what
are
you
talking
about
answers
the
first
one
again
it
evening
of
course
the
date
was
hopeless
it
was
a
good
thing
if
we
remembered
the
year
only
when
writing
in
our
diaries
and
observation
books
did
we
come
across
such
things
as
dates
while
at
work
we
had
not
the
remotest
idea
of
them
splendid
weather
it
was
when
we
turned
out
on
the
morning
of
january
we
had
now
agreed
to
go
as
it
suited
us
and
take
no
notice
of
day
or
night
for
some
time
past
we
had
all
been
sick
of
the
long
hours
of
rest
and
wanted
to
break
them
up
at
any
price
as
i
have
said
the
weather
could
not
have
been
finer
brilliantly
clear
and
a
dead
calm
the
temperature
of
felt
altogether
like
summer
in
this
bright
still
air
before
we
began
our
march
all
unnecessary
clothes
were
taken
off
and
put
on
the
sledges
it
almost
looked
as
if
everything
would
be
considered
superfluous
and
the
costume
in
which
we
finally
started
would
no
doubt
have
been
regarded
as
somewhat
unseemly
in
our
latitudes
we
smiled
and
congratulated
ourselves
that
at
present
no
ladies
had
reached
the
antarctic
regions
or
they
might
have
objected
to
our
extremely
comfortable
and
serviceable
costume
the
high
land
now
stood
out
still
more
sharply
it
was
very
interesting
to
see
in
these
conditions
the
country
we
had
gone
through
on
the
southward
trip
in
the
thickest
blizzard
we
had
then
been
going
along
the
foot
of
this
immense
mountain
chain
without
a
suspicion
of
how
near
we
were
to
it
or
how
colossal
it
was
the
ground
was
fortunately
quite
undisturbed
in
this
part
i
say
fortunately
as
heaven
knows
what
would
have
happened
to
us
if
we
had
been
obliged
to
cross
a
crevassed
surface
in
such
weather
as
we
then
had
perhaps
we
should
have
managed
it
perhaps
not
the
journey
before
us
was
a
stiff
one
as
the
butcher
lay
feet
higher
than
the
place
where
we
were
we
had
been
expecting
to
stumble
upon
one
of
our
beacons
before
long
but
this
did
not
happen
until
we
had
gone
twelve
and
a
half
miles
then
one
of
them
suddenly
came
in
sight
and
was
greeted
with
joy
we
knew
well
enough
that
we
were
on
the
right
track
but
an
old
acquaintance
like
this
was
very
welcome
all
the
same
the
sun
had
evidently
been
at
work
up
here
while
we
were
in
the
south
as
some
of
the
beacons
were
quite
bent
over
and
great
icicles
told
us
clearly
enough
how
powerful
the
sunshine
had
been
after
a
march
of
about
miles
we
halted
at
the
beacon
we
had
built
right
under
the
hill
where
we
had
been
forced
to
stop
by
thick
weather
on
november
january
was
one
of
the
days
to
which
we
looked
forward
with
anxiety
as
we
were
then
due
at
our
depot
at
the
butcher
and
had
to
find
it
this
depot
which
consisted
of
the
finest
fresh
dogs
flesh
was
of
immense
importance
to
us
not
only
had
our
animals
got
into
the
way
of
preferring
this
food
to
pemmican
but
what
was
of
still
greater
importance
it
had
an
extremely
good
effect
on
the
dogs
state
of
health
no
doubt
our
pemmican
was
good
enough
indeed
it
could
not
have
been
better
but
a
variation
of
diet
is
a
great
consideration
and
seems
according
to
my
experience
to
mean
even
more
to
the
dogs
than
to
the
men
on
a
long
journey
like
this
on
former
occasions
i
have
seen
dogs
refuse
pemmican
presumably
because
they
were
tired
of
it
having
no
variety
the
result
was
that
the
dogs
grew
thin
and
weak
although
we
had
food
enough
the
pemmican
i
am
referring
to
on
that
occasion
was
made
for
human
use
so
that
their
distaste
can
not
have
been
due
to
the
quality
it
was
when
we
set
out
we
had
not
had
a
long
sleep
but
it
was
very
important
to
avail
ourselves
of
this
fine
clear
weather
while
it
lasted
we
knew
by
experience
that
up
here
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
butcher
the
weather
was
not
to
be
depended
upon
from
the
outward
journey
we
knew
that
the
distance
from
the
beacon
where
our
camp
was
to
the
depot
at
the
butcher
was
thirteen
and
a
half
miles
we
had
not
put
up
more
than
two
beacons
on
this
stretch
but
the
ground
was
of
such
a
nature
that
we
thought
we
could
not
go
wrong
that
it
was
not
so
easy
to
find
the
way
in
spite
of
the
beacons
we
were
soon
to
discover
in
the
fine
clear
weather
and
with
hanssen
sharp
eyes
we
picked
up
both
our
beacons
meanwhile
we
were
astonished
at
the
appearance
of
the
mountains
as
i
have
already
mentioned
we
thought
the
weather
was
perfectly
clear
when
we
reached
the
butcher
for
the
first
time
on
november
i
then
took
a
bearing
from
the
tent
of
the
way
we
had
come
up
on
to
the
plateau
between
the
mountains
and
carefully
recorded
it
after
passing
our
last
beacon
when
we
were
beginning
to
approach
the
butcher
as
we
reckoned
we
were
greatly
surprised
at
the
aspect
of
our
surroundings
last
time
on
november
we
had
seen
mountains
on
the
west
and
north
but
a
long
way
off
now
the
whole
of
that
part
of
the
horizon
seemed
to
be
filled
with
colossal
mountain
masses
which
were
right
over
us
what
in
the
world
was
the
meaning
of
this
was
it
witchcraft
i
am
sure
i
began
to
think
so
for
a
moment
i
would
readily
have
taken
my
most
solemn
oath
that
i
had
never
seen
that
landscape
before
in
my
life
we
had
now
gone
the
full
distance
and
according
to
the
beacons
we
had
passed
we
ought
to
be
on
the
spot
this
was
very
strange
in
the
direction
in
which
i
had
taken
the
bearing
of
our
ascent
we
now
only
saw
the
side
of
a
perfectly
unknown
mountain
sticking
up
from
the
plain
there
could
be
absolutely
no
way
down
in
that
precipitous
wall
only
on
the
did
the
ground
give
the
impression
of
allowing
a
descent
there
a
natural
depression
seemed
to
be
formed
running
down
towards
the
barrier
which
we
could
see
far
far
away
we
halted
and
discussed
the
situation
hullo
hanssen
suddenly
exclaimed
somebody
has
been
here
before
yes
broke
in
wisting
i
hanged
if
that
is
my
broken
ski
that
i
stuck
up
by
the
depot
so
it
was
wisting
broken
ski
that
brought
us
out
of
this
unpleasant
situation
it
was
a
good
thing
he
put
it
there
very
thoughtful
in
any
case
i
now
examined
the
place
with
the
glasses
and
by
the
side
of
a
snow
mound
which
proved
to
be
our
depot
but
might
easily
have
escaped
our
notice
we
could
see
the
ski
sticking
up
out
of
the
snow
we
cheerfully
set
our
course
for
the
spot
but
did
not
reach
it
until
we
had
gone
three
miles
there
was
rejoicing
in
our
little
band
when
we
arrived
and
saw
that
what
we
had
considered
the
most
important
point
of
our
homeward
journey
had
been
reached
it
was
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
the
food
it
contained
that
we
considered
it
so
necessary
to
find
this
spot
as
for
discovering
the
way
down
to
the
barrier
again
and
now
that
we
stood
there
we
recognized
this
necessity
more
than
ever
for
although
we
now
knew
from
our
bearings
exactly
where
the
descent
lay
we
could
see
nothing
of
it
at
all
the
plateau
there
seemed
to
go
right
up
to
the
mountain
without
any
opening
towards
the
lower
ground
beyond
and
yet
the
compass
told
us
that
such
an
opening
must
exist
and
would
take
us
down
the
mountain
on
which
we
had
thus
walked
all
day
on
the
outward
journey
without
knowing
anything
of
it
was
mount
fridtjof
nansen
yes
the
difference
in
the
light
made
a
surprising
alteration
in
the
appearance
of
things
the
first
thing
we
did
on
reaching
the
depot
was
to
take
out
the
dogs
carcasses
that
lay
there
and
cut
them
into
big
lumps
that
were
divided
among
the
dogs
they
looked
rather
surprised
they
had
not
been
accustomed
to
such
rations
we
threw
three
carcasses
on
to
the
sledges
so
as
to
have
a
little
extra
food
for
them
on
the
way
down
the
butcher
was
not
a
very
friendly
spot
this
time
either
true
it
was
not
the
same
awful
weather
as
on
our
first
visit
but
it
was
blowing
a
fresh
breeze
with
a
temperature
of
which
after
the
heat
of
the
last
few
days
seemed
to
go
to
marrow
and
did
not
invite
us
to
stay
longer
than
was
absolutely
necessary
therefore
as
soon
as
we
had
finished
feeding
the
dogs
and
putting
our
sledges
in
order
we
set
out
although
the
ground
had
not
given
us
the
impression
of
sloping
we
soon
found
out
that
it
did
so
when
we
got
under
way
it
was
not
only
downhill
but
the
pace
became
so
great
that
we
had
to
stop
and
put
brakes
under
the
sledges
as
we
advanced
the
apparently
unbroken
wall
opened
more
and
more
and
showed
us
at
last
our
old
familiar
ascent
there
lay
mount
ole
engelstad
snowclad
and
cold
as
we
saw
it
the
first
time
as
we
rounded
it
we
came
on
to
the
severe
steep
slope
where
on
the
way
south
i
had
so
much
admired
the
work
done
by
my
companions
and
the
dogs
that
day
but
now
i
had
an
even
better
opportunity
of
seeing
how
steep
this
ascent
really
had
been
many
were
the
brakes
we
had
to
put
on
before
we
could
reduce
the
speed
to
a
moderate
pace
but
even
so
we
came
down
rapidly
and
soon
the
first
part
of
the
descent
lay
behind
us
so
as
not
to
be
exposed
to
possible
gusts
from
the
plain
we
went
round
mount
engelstad
and
camped
under
the
lee
of
it
well
content
with
the
day
work
the
snow
lay
here
as
on
our
first
visit
deep
and
loose
and
it
was
difficult
to
find
anything
like
a
good
place
for
the
tent
we
could
soon
feel
that
we
had
descended
a
couple
of
thousand
feet
and
come
down
among
the
mountains
it
was
still
absolutely
still
and
the
sun
broiled
us
as
on
a
day
of
high
summer
at
home
i
thought
too
that
i
could
notice
a
difference
in
my
breathing
it
seemed
to
work
much
more
easily
and
pleasantly
perhaps
it
was
only
imagination
at
one
on
the
following
morning
we
were
out
again
the
sight
that
met
our
eyes
that
morning
when
we
came
out
of
the
tent
was
one
of
those
that
will
always
live
in
our
memories
the
tent
stood
in
the
narrow
gap
between
fridtjof
nansen
and
ole
engelstad
the
sun
which
now
stood
in
the
south
was
completely
hidden
by
the
latter
mountain
and
our
camp
was
thus
in
the
deepest
shadow
but
right
against
us
on
the
other
side
the
nansen
mountain
raised
its
splendid
summit
high
towards
heaven
gleaming
and
sparkling
in
the
rays
of
the
midnight
sun
the
shining
white
passed
gradually
very
gradually
into
pale
blue
then
deeper
and
deeper
blue
until
the
shadow
swallowed
it
up
but
down
below
right
on
the
heiberg
glacier
its
side
was
exposed
dark
and
solemn
the
mountain
mass
stood
out
mount
engelstad
lay
in
shadow
but
on
its
summit
rested
a
beautiful
light
little
cirrus
cloud
red
with
an
edge
of
gold
down
over
its
side
the
blocks
of
ice
lay
scattered
and
farther
down
on
the
east
rose
don
pedro
christophersen
partly
in
shadow
partly
gleaming
in
the
sun
a
marvellously
beautiful
sight
and
all
was
so
still
one
almost
feared
to
disturb
the
incomparable
splendour
of
the
scene
we
now
knew
the
ground
well
enough
to
be
able
to
go
straight
ahead
without
any
detours
the
huge
avalanches
were
more
frequent
than
on
the
outward
journey
one
mass
of
snow
after
another
plunged
down
don
pedro
was
getting
rid
of
his
winter
coat
the
going
was
precisely
the
same
loose
fairly
deep
snow
we
went
quite
easily
over
it
however
and
it
was
all
downhill
on
the
ridge
where
the
descent
to
the
glacier
began
we
halted
to
make
our
preparations
brakes
were
put
under
the
sledges
and
our
two
were
fastened
together
to
make
one
strong
one
we
should
have
to
be
able
to
stop
instantly
if
surprised
by
a
crevasse
as
we
were
going
we
went
in
front
the
going
was
ideal
here
on
the
steep
slope
just
enough
loose
snow
to
give
one
good
steering
on
ski
we
went
whizzing
down
and
it
was
not
many
minutes
before
we
were
on
the
heiberg
glacier
for
the
drivers
it
was
not
quite
such
plain
sailing
they
followed
our
tracks
but
had
to
be
extremely
careful
on
the
steep
fall
we
camped
that
evening
on
the
selfsame
spot
where
we
had
had
our
tent
on
november
at
about
feet
above
the
sea
from
here
one
could
see
the
course
of
the
axel
heiberg
glacier
right
down
to
its
junction
with
the
barrier
it
looked
fine
and
even
and
we
decided
to
follow
it
instead
of
climbing
over
the
mountain
as
we
had
done
on
the
way
south
perhaps
the
distance
would
be
somewhat
longer
but
probably
we
should
make
a
considerable
saving
of
time
we
had
now
agreed
upon
a
new
arrangement
of
our
time
the
long
spells
of
rest
were
becoming
almost
unbearable
another
very
important
side
of
the
question
was
that
by
a
reasonable
arrangement
we
should
be
able
to
save
a
lot
of
time
and
reach
home
several
days
sooner
than
we
had
reckoned
after
a
great
deal
of
talk
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
we
agreed
to
arrange
matters
thus
we
were
to
do
our
fifteen
geographical
miles
or
kilometres
and
then
have
a
sleep
of
six
hours
turn
out
again
and
do
fifteen
miles
more
and
so
on
in
this
way
we
should
accomplish
a
very
good
average
distance
on
our
day
march
we
kept
to
this
arrangement
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
and
thus
saved
a
good
many
days
our
progress
down
the
heiberg
glacier
did
not
encounter
any
obstructions
only
at
the
transition
from
the
glacier
to
the
barrier
were
there
a
few
crevasses
that
had
to
be
circumvented
at
on
january
we
halted
at
the
angle
of
land
that
forms
the
entrance
to
the
heiberg
glacier
and
thence
extends
northward
we
had
not
yet
recognized
any
of
the
land
we
lay
under
but
that
was
quite
natural
as
we
now
saw
it
from
the
opposite
side
we
knew
though
that
we
were
not
far
away
from
our
main
depot
in
on
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
we
were
off
again
from
a
little
ridge
we
crossed
immediately
after
starting
bjaaland
thought
he
could
see
the
depot
down
on
the
barrier
and
it
was
not
very
long
before
we
came
in
sight
of
mount
betty
and
our
way
up
and
now
we
could
make
sure
with
the
glasses
that
it
really
was
our
depot
that
we
saw
the
same
that
bjaaland
thought
he
had
seen
before
we
therefore
set
our
course
straight
for
it
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
once
more
on
the
barrier
january
after
a
stay
of
days
on
land
it
was
on
november
that
we
had
begun
the
ascent
we
reached
the
depot
and
found
everything
in
order
the
heat
here
must
have
been
very
powerful
our
lofty
solid
depot
was
melted
by
the
sun
into
a
rather
low
mound
of
snow
the
pemmican
rations
that
had
been
exposed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
sun
rays
had
assumed
the
strangest
forms
and
of
course
they
had
become
rancid
we
got
the
sledges
ready
at
once
taking
all
the
provisions
out
of
the
depot
and
loading
them
we
left
behind
some
of
the
old
clothes
we
had
been
wearing
all
the
way
from
here
to
the
pole
and
back
when
we
had
completed
all
this
repacking
and
had
everything
ready
two
of
us
went
over
to
mount
betty
and
collected
as
many
different
specimens
of
rock
as
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
at
the
same
time
we
built
a
great
cairn
and
left
there
a
can
of
litres
of
paraffin
two
packets
of
matches
containing
twenty
boxes
and
an
account
of
our
expedition
possibly
someone
may
find
a
use
for
these
things
in
the
future
we
had
to
kill
frithjof
one
of
bjaaland
dogs
at
this
camp
he
had
latterly
been
showing
marked
signs
of
shortness
of
breath
and
finally
this
became
so
painful
to
the
animal
that
we
decided
to
put
an
end
to
him
thus
brave
frithjof
ended
his
career
on
cutting
him
open
it
appeared
that
his
lungs
were
quite
shrivelled
up
nevertheless
the
remains
disappeared
pretty
quickly
into
his
stomachs
what
they
had
lost
in
quantity
did
not
apparently
affect
their
quality
nigger
one
of
hassel
dogs
had
been
destroyed
on
the
way
down
from
the
plateau
we
thus
reached
this
point
again
with
twelve
dogs
as
we
had
reckoned
on
doing
and
left
it
with
eleven
i
see
in
my
diary
the
following
remark
the
dogs
look
just
as
well
as
when
we
left
framheim
on
leaving
the
place
a
few
hours
later
we
had
provisions
for
days
on
the
sledges
besides
this
of
course
we
had
a
depot
at
every
degree
of
latitude
up
to
it
looked
as
though
we
had
found
our
depot
at
the
right
moment
for
when
we
came
out
to
continue
our
journey
the
whole
barrier
was
in
a
blizzard
a
gale
was
blowing
from
the
south
with
a
sky
completely
clouded
over
falling
snow
and
drift
united
in
a
delightful
dance
and
made
it
difficult
to
see
the
lucky
thing
was
that
now
we
had
the
wind
with
us
and
thus
escaped
getting
it
all
in
our
eyes
as
we
had
been
accustomed
to
the
big
crevasse
which
as
we
knew
lay
right
across
the
line
of
our
route
made
us
go
very
carefully
to
avoid
any
risk
bjaaland
and
hassel
who
went
in
advance
fastened
an
alpine
rope
between
them
the
snow
was
very
deep
and
loose
and
the
going
very
heavy
fortunately
we
were
warned
in
time
of
our
approach
to
the
expected
cracks
by
the
appearance
of
some
bare
ice
ridges
these
told
us
clearly
enough
that
disturbances
had
taken
place
here
and
that
even
greater
ones
might
be
expected
probably
near
at
hand
at
that
moment
the
thick
curtain
of
cloud
was
torn
asunder
and
the
sun
pierced
the
whirling
mass
of
snow
instantly
hanssen
shouted
stop
bjaaland
he
was
just
on
the
edge
of
the
yawning
crevasse
bjaaland
himself
has
splendid
sight
but
his
excellent
his
own
patent
entirely
prevented
his
seeing
well
bjaaland
would
not
have
been
in
any
serious
danger
if
he
had
fallen
into
the
crevasse
as
he
was
roped
to
hassel
but
it
would
have
been
confoundedly
unpleasant
all
the
same
as
i
have
said
before
i
assume
that
these
great
disturbances
here
mark
the
boundary
between
the
barrier
and
the
land
this
time
curiously
enough
they
seemed
also
to
form
a
boundary
between
good
and
bad
weather
for
on
the
far
side
of
them
to
the
north
the
barrier
lay
bathed
in
sunshine
on
the
south
the
blizzard
raged
worse
than
ever
mount
betty
was
the
last
to
send
us
its
farewell
south
victoria
land
had
gone
into
hiding
and
did
not
show
itself
again
as
soon
as
we
came
into
the
sunshine
we
ran
upon
one
of
our
beacons
our
course
lay
straight
towards
it
that
was
not
bad
steering
in
the
dark
at
we
reached
the
depot
in
now
we
could
begin
to
be
liberal
with
the
dogs
food
too
they
had
double
pemmican
rations
besides
as
many
oatmeal
biscuits
as
they
would
eat
we
had
such
masses
of
biscuits
now
that
we
could
positively
throw
them
about
of
course
we
might
have
left
a
large
part
of
these
provisions
behind
but
there
was
a
great
satisfaction
in
being
so
well
supplied
with
food
and
the
dogs
did
not
seem
to
mind
the
little
extra
weight
in
the
least
as
long
as
things
went
so
capitally
as
they
were
going
that
is
with
men
and
dogs
exactly
keeping
pace
with
one
another
we
could
ask
for
nothing
better
but
the
weather
that
had
cheered
us
was
not
of
long
duration
same
beastly
weather
my
diary
says
of
the
next
stage
the
wind
had
shifted
to
the
with
overcast
thick
weather
and
very
troublesome
drifting
snow
in
spite
of
these
unfavourable
conditions
we
passed
beacon
after
beacon
and
at
the
end
of
our
march
had
picked
up
all
the
beacons
we
had
erected
on
this
distance
of
seventeen
miles
and
but
as
before
we
owed
this
to
hanssen
good
eyes
on
our
way
southward
we
had
taken
a
good
deal
of
seal
meat
and
had
divided
it
among
the
depots
we
built
on
the
barrier
in
such
a
way
that
we
were
now
able
to
eat
fresh
meat
every
day
this
had
not
been
done
without
an
object
if
we
should
be
visited
with
scurvy
this
fresh
meat
would
be
invaluable
as
we
were
sound
and
healthy
as
we
had
never
been
before
the
was
a
pleasant
distraction
in
our
menu
nothing
more
the
temperature
had
risen
greatly
since
we
came
down
on
to
the
barrier
and
kept
steady
at
about
we
were
so
warm
in
our
that
we
had
to
turn
them
with
the
hair
out
that
was
better
we
breathed
more
freely
and
felt
happier
just
like
going
into
an
somebody
remarked
the
same
feeling
as
when
on
a
really
warm
summer
day
one
comes
out
of
the
hot
sun
into
cool
shade
january
same
beastly
weather
snow
snow
snow
nothing
but
snow
is
there
no
end
to
it
thick
too
so
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
see
ten
yards
ahead
temperature
thawing
everywhere
on
the
sledges
everything
getting
wet
have
not
found
a
single
beacon
in
this
blind
man
weather
the
snow
was
very
deep
to
begin
with
and
the
going
exceedingly
heavy
but
in
spite
of
this
the
dogs
managed
their
sledges
very
well
that
evening
the
weather
improved
fortunately
and
became
comparatively
clear
by
the
time
we
resumed
our
journey
at
not
long
after
we
sighted
one
of
our
beacons
it
lay
to
the
west
about
yards
away
we
were
thus
not
far
out
of
our
course
we
turned
aside
and
went
up
to
it
as
it
was
interesting
to
see
whether
our
reckoning
was
in
order
the
beacon
was
somewhat
damaged
by
sunshine
and
storms
but
we
found
the
paper
left
in
it
which
told
us
that
this
beacon
was
erected
on
november
in
it
also
told
us
what
course
to
steer
by
compass
to
reach
the
next
beacon
which
lay
five
kilometres
from
this
one
as
we
were
leaving
this
old
friend
and
setting
our
course
as
it
advised
to
our
unspeakable
astonishment
two
great
birds
skua
gulls
suddenly
came
flying
straight
towards
us
they
circled
round
us
once
or
twice
and
then
settled
on
the
beacon
can
anyone
who
reads
these
lines
form
an
idea
of
the
effect
this
had
upon
us
it
is
hardly
likely
they
brought
us
a
message
from
the
living
world
into
this
realm
of
death
a
message
of
all
that
was
dear
to
us
i
think
the
same
thoughts
filled
us
all
they
did
not
allow
themselves
a
long
rest
these
first
messengers
from
another
world
they
sat
still
a
while
no
doubt
wondering
who
we
were
then
rose
aloft
and
flew
on
to
the
south
mysterious
creatures
they
were
now
exactly
between
framheim
and
the
pole
and
yet
they
were
going
farther
inland
were
they
going
over
to
the
other
side
our
march
ended
this
time
at
one
of
our
beacons
in
it
felt
so
good
and
safe
to
lie
beside
one
of
these
it
always
gave
us
a
sure
for
the
following
stage
we
were
up
at
and
left
the
place
a
few
hours
later
with
the
result
that
the
day
march
brought
us
miles
nearer
framheim
with
our
present
arrangement
we
had
these
marches
every
other
day
our
dogs
need
no
better
testimonial
than
this
one
day
seventeen
miles
the
next
day
and
fresh
all
the
way
home
the
two
birds
agreeably
as
their
first
appearance
had
affected
me
led
my
thoughts
after
a
while
in
another
direction
which
was
anything
but
agreeable
it
occurred
to
me
that
these
two
might
only
be
representatives
of
a
larger
collection
of
these
voracious
birds
and
that
the
remainder
might
now
be
occupied
in
consuming
all
the
fresh
meat
we
had
so
laboriously
transported
with
us
and
spread
all
over
the
plain
in
our
depots
it
is
incredible
what
a
flock
of
these
birds
of
prey
can
get
rid
of
it
would
not
matter
if
the
meat
were
frozen
as
hard
as
iron
they
would
have
managed
it
even
if
it
had
been
a
good
deal
harder
than
iron
of
the
seals
carcasses
we
had
lying
in
i
saw
in
my
thoughts
nothing
but
the
bones
of
the
various
dogs
we
had
killed
on
our
way
south
and
laid
on
the
tops
of
beacons
i
did
not
see
even
so
much
as
that
well
it
was
possible
that
my
thoughts
had
begun
to
assume
too
dark
a
hue
perhaps
the
reality
would
be
brighter
weather
and
going
began
by
degrees
to
right
themselves
it
looked
as
if
things
would
improve
in
proportion
to
our
distance
from
land
finally
both
became
perfect
the
sun
shone
from
a
cloudless
sky
and
the
sledges
ran
on
the
fine
even
surface
with
all
the
ease
and
speed
that
could
be
desired
bjaaland
who
had
occupied
the
position
of
forerunner
all
the
way
from
the
pole
performed
his
duties
admirably
but
the
old
saying
that
nobody
is
perfect
applied
even
to
him
none
of
us
no
matter
who
it
may
be
can
keep
in
a
straight
line
when
he
has
no
marks
to
follow
all
the
more
difficult
is
this
when
as
so
often
happened
with
us
one
has
to
go
blindly
most
of
us
i
suppose
would
swerve
now
to
one
side
now
to
the
other
and
possibly
end
after
all
this
groping
by
keeping
pretty
well
to
the
line
not
so
with
bjaaland
he
was
a
man
i
can
see
him
now
hanssen
has
given
him
the
direction
by
compass
and
bjaaland
turns
round
points
his
ski
in
the
line
indicated
and
sets
of
with
decision
his
movements
clearly
show
that
he
has
made
up
his
mind
cost
what
it
may
to
keep
in
the
right
direction
he
sends
his
ski
firmly
along
so
that
the
snow
spurts
from
them
and
looks
straight
before
him
but
the
result
is
the
same
if
hanssen
had
let
bjaaland
go
on
without
any
correction
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
so
the
latter
would
probably
have
described
a
beautiful
circle
and
brought
himself
back
to
the
spot
from
which
he
had
started
perhaps
after
all
this
was
not
a
fault
to
complain
of
since
we
always
knew
with
absolute
certainty
that
when
we
had
got
out
of
the
line
of
beacons
we
were
to
the
right
of
it
and
had
to
search
for
the
beacons
to
the
west
this
conclusion
proved
very
useful
to
us
more
than
once
and
we
gradually
became
so
familiar
with
bjaaland
tendencies
that
we
actually
counted
on
them
on
january
according
to
our
reckoning
we
ought
to
reach
the
depot
in
this
was
the
last
of
our
depots
that
was
not
marked
at
right
angles
to
the
route
and
therefore
the
last
critical
point
the
day
was
not
altogether
suited
for
finding
the
needle
in
the
haystack
it
was
calm
with
a
thick
fog
so
thick
that
we
could
only
see
a
few
yards
in
front
of
us
we
did
not
see
a
single
beacon
on
the
whole
march
at
we
had
completed
the
distance
according
to
the
and
reckoned
that
we
ought
to
be
in
by
the
depot
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
we
decided
therefore
to
set
our
tent
and
wait
till
it
cleared
while
we
were
at
work
with
this
there
was
a
rift
in
the
thick
mass
of
fog
and
there
not
many
yards
away
to
the
west
of
course
lay
our
depot
we
quickly
took
the
tent
down
again
packed
it
on
the
sledge
and
drove
up
to
our
food
mound
which
proved
to
be
quite
in
order
there
was
no
sign
of
the
birds
having
paid
it
a
visit
but
what
was
that
fresh
in
the
snow
we
soon
saw
that
they
must
be
the
tracks
of
the
runaways
that
we
had
lost
here
on
the
way
south
judging
by
appearances
they
must
have
lain
under
the
lee
of
the
depot
for
a
considerable
time
two
deep
hollows
in
the
snow
told
us
that
plainly
and
evidently
they
must
have
had
enough
food
but
where
on
earth
had
they
got
it
from
the
depot
was
absolutely
untouched
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
lumps
of
pemmican
lay
exposed
to
the
light
of
day
and
were
very
easy
to
get
at
besides
which
the
snow
on
the
depot
was
not
so
hard
as
to
prevent
the
dogs
pulling
it
down
and
eating
up
all
the
food
meanwhile
the
dogs
had
left
the
place
again
as
shown
by
the
fresh
trail
which
pointed
to
the
north
we
examined
the
tracks
very
closely
and
agreed
that
they
were
not
more
than
two
days
old
they
went
northward
and
we
followed
them
from
time
to
time
on
our
next
stage
at
the
beacon
in
where
we
halted
we
saw
them
still
going
to
the
north
in
the
trail
began
to
be
much
confused
and
ended
by
pointing
due
west
that
was
the
last
we
saw
of
the
tracks
but
we
had
not
done
with
these
dogs
or
rather
with
their
deeds
we
stopped
at
the
beacon
in
else
who
had
been
laid
on
the
top
of
it
had
fallen
down
and
lay
by
the
side
the
sun
had
thawed
away
the
lower
part
of
the
beacon
so
the
roving
dogs
had
not
been
here
so
much
was
certain
for
otherwise
we
should
not
have
found
else
as
we
did
we
camped
at
the
end
of
that
stage
by
the
beacon
in
and
shared
out
else
body
although
she
had
been
lying
in
the
strong
sunshine
the
flesh
was
quite
good
when
we
had
scraped
away
a
little
mouldiness
it
smelt
rather
old
perhaps
but
our
dogs
were
not
fastidious
when
it
was
a
question
of
meat
on
january
we
arrived
at
the
depot
in
we
could
see
from
a
long
way
off
that
the
order
in
which
we
had
left
it
no
longer
prevailed
when
we
came
up
to
it
we
saw
at
once
what
had
happened
the
innumerable
that
had
trampled
the
snow
quite
hard
round
the
depot
declared
plainly
enough
that
the
runaways
had
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
here
several
of
the
cases
belonging
to
the
depot
had
fallen
down
presumably
from
the
same
cause
as
else
and
the
rascals
had
succeeded
in
breaking
into
one
of
them
of
the
biscuits
and
pemmican
which
it
had
contained
nothing
of
course
was
left
but
that
made
no
difference
to
us
now
as
we
had
food
in
abundance
the
two
dogs
carcasses
that
we
had
placed
on
the
top
of
the
depot
uranus
and
jaala
were
gone
not
even
the
teeth
were
to
be
seen
yet
they
had
left
the
teeth
of
lucy
whom
they
had
eaten
in
jaala
eight
puppies
were
still
lying
on
the
top
of
a
case
curiously
enough
they
had
not
fallen
down
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
the
beasts
had
devoured
some
and
things
of
that
sort
it
was
no
loss
to
us
as
it
happened
but
who
could
tell
which
way
these
creatures
had
gone
if
they
had
succeeded
in
finding
the
depot
in
they
would
probably
by
this
time
have
finished
our
supply
of
seal
meat
there
of
course
it
would
be
regrettable
if
this
had
happened
although
it
would
entail
no
danger
either
to
ourselves
or
our
animals
if
we
got
as
far
as
we
should
come
through
all
right
for
the
time
being
we
had
to
console
ourselves
with
the
fact
that
we
could
see
no
continuation
of
the
trail
northward
we
permitted
ourselves
a
little
feast
here
in
the
chocolate
pudding
that
wisting
served
as
dessert
is
still
fresh
in
my
memory
we
all
agreed
that
it
came
nearer
perfection
than
anything
it
had
hitherto
fallen
to
our
lot
to
taste
i
may
disclose
the
receipt
dried
milk
and
chocolate
are
put
into
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
what
happens
afterwards
i
do
know
for
further
information
apply
to
wisting
between
and
we
came
into
our
old
marks
of
the
second
depot
journey
on
that
trip
we
had
marked
this
distance
with
splinters
of
at
every
geographical
mile
that
was
in
march
and
now
we
were
following
these
splinters
in
the
second
half
of
january
apparently
they
stood
exactly
as
they
had
been
put
in
this
marking
stopped
in
with
two
pieces
of
case
on
a
snow
pedestal
the
pedestal
was
still
intact
and
good
i
shall
let
my
diary
describe
what
we
saw
on
january
unusually
fine
weather
light
breeze
which
in
the
course
of
our
march
cleared
the
whole
sky
in
we
came
abreast
of
our
old
big
pressure
ridges
we
now
saw
far
more
of
them
than
ever
before
they
extended
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
running
to
in
ridges
and
peaks
great
was
our
surprise
when
a
short
time
after
we
made
out
high
bare
land
in
the
same
direction
and
not
long
after
that
two
lofty
white
summits
to
the
probably
in
about
it
could
be
seen
by
the
look
of
the
sky
that
the
land
extended
from
to
this
must
be
the
same
land
that
we
saw
lose
itself
in
the
horizon
in
about
when
we
stood
at
a
height
of
about
feet
and
looked
out
over
the
barrier
during
our
ascent
we
now
have
sufficient
indications
to
enable
us
without
hesitation
to
draw
this
land
as
continuous
carmen
land
the
surface
against
the
land
is
violently
disturbed
crevasses
and
pressure
ridges
waves
and
valleys
in
all
directions
we
shall
no
doubt
feel
the
effect
of
it
although
what
we
have
seen
apparently
justifies
us
in
concluding
that
carmen
land
extends
from
to
this
position
about
and
possibly
farther
to
the
i
have
not
ventured
to
lay
it
down
thus
on
the
map
i
have
contented
myself
with
giving
the
name
of
carmen
land
to
the
land
between
and
and
have
called
the
rest
appearance
of
land
it
will
be
a
profitable
task
for
an
explorer
to
investigate
this
district
more
closely
as
we
had
expected
on
our
next
stage
we
were
made
to
feel
the
effect
of
the
disturbances
three
times
we
had
now
gone
over
this
stretch
of
the
barrier
without
having
really
clear
weather
this
time
we
had
it
and
were
able
to
see
what
it
actually
looked
like
the
irregularities
began
in
and
did
not
extend
very
far
from
north
to
about
five
kilometres
three
and
a
quarter
miles
how
far
they
extended
from
east
to
west
it
is
difficult
to
say
but
at
any
rate
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
immense
pieces
of
the
surface
had
fallen
away
and
opened
up
the
most
horrible
yawning
gulfs
big
enough
to
swallow
many
caravans
of
the
size
of
ours
from
these
open
holes
ugly
wide
cracks
ran
out
in
all
directions
besides
which
mounds
and
haycocks
were
everywhere
to
be
seen
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
thing
of
all
was
that
we
had
passed
over
here
unharmed
we
went
across
as
as
possible
and
at
top
speed
hanssen
went
halfway
into
a
crevasse
but
luckily
got
out
of
it
again
without
difficulty
the
depot
in
was
in
perfect
order
no
to
be
seen
there
our
hopes
that
the
depot
in
would
be
intact
rose
considerably
in
lay
the
first
dog
we
had
killed
bone
he
was
particularly
fat
and
was
immensely
appreciated
the
dogs
no
longer
cared
very
much
for
pemmican
on
january
we
passed
our
last
beacon
which
stood
in
glad
as
we
were
to
leave
it
behind
i
can
not
deny
that
it
was
with
a
certain
feeling
of
melancholy
that
we
saw
it
vanish
we
had
grown
so
fond
of
our
beacons
and
whenever
we
met
them
we
greeted
them
as
old
friends
many
and
great
were
the
services
these
silent
watchers
did
us
on
our
long
and
lonely
way
on
the
same
day
we
reached
our
big
depot
in
and
now
we
considered
that
we
were
back
we
could
see
at
once
that
others
had
been
at
the
depot
since
we
had
left
it
and
we
found
a
message
from
lieutenant
prestrud
the
leader
of
the
eastern
party
saying
that
he
with
stubberud
and
johansen
had
passed
here
on
november
with
two
sledges
sixteen
dogs
and
supplies
for
thirty
days
everything
thus
appeared
to
be
in
the
best
of
order
immediately
on
arriving
at
the
depot
we
let
the
dogs
loose
and
they
made
a
dash
for
the
heap
of
seal
flesh
which
had
been
attacked
neither
by
birds
nor
dogs
in
our
absence
it
was
not
so
much
for
the
sake
of
eating
that
our
dogs
made
their
way
to
the
meat
mound
as
for
the
sake
of
fighting
now
they
really
had
something
to
fight
about
they
went
round
the
carcasses
a
few
times
looked
askance
at
the
food
and
at
each
other
and
then
flung
themselves
into
the
wildest
scrimmage
when
this
had
been
duly
brought
to
a
conclusion
they
went
away
and
lay
round
their
sledges
the
depot
in
is
still
large
well
supplied
and
well
marked
so
it
is
not
impossible
that
it
may
be
found
useful
later
the
journey
from
to
framheim
has
been
so
often
described
that
there
is
nothing
new
to
say
about
it
on
january
at
we
reached
our
good
little
house
again
with
two
sledges
and
eleven
dogs
men
and
animals
all
hale
and
hearty
we
stood
and
waited
for
each
other
outside
the
door
in
the
early
morning
our
appearance
must
be
made
all
together
it
was
so
still
and
quiet
they
must
be
all
asleep
we
came
in
stubberud
started
up
in
his
bunk
and
glared
at
us
no
doubt
he
took
us
for
ghosts
one
after
another
they
woke
up
not
grasping
what
was
happening
then
there
was
a
hearty
welcome
home
on
all
sides
the
fram
was
of
course
our
first
question
our
joy
was
great
when
we
heard
all
was
well
and
what
about
the
pole
have
you
been
there
yes
of
course
otherwise
you
would
hardly
have
seen
us
again
then
the

the

there
was

out

see
that

northward
after
two
days
of
bustle
in
getting
on
board
the
things
we
were
to
take
with
us
we
managed
to
be
ready
for
sea
on
the
afternoon
of
january
there
could
scarcely
have
been
anything
at
that
moment
that
rejoiced
us
more
than
just
that
fact
that
we
were
able
at
so
early
a
date
to
set
our
course
northward
and
thus
take
the
first
step
on
the
way
to
that
world
which
as
we
knew
would
soon
begin
to
expect
news
from
us
or
of
us
and
yet
i
wonder
whether
there
was
not
a
little
feeling
of
melancholy
in
the
midst
of
all
our
joy
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
such
was
really
the
case
although
to
many
this
may
seem
a
flat
contradiction
but
it
is
not
altogether
so
easy
to
part
from
a
place
that
has
been
one
home
for
any
length
of
time
even
though
this
home
lie
in
the
degree
of
latitude
more
or
less
buried
in
snow
and
ice
we
human
beings
are
far
too
dependent
on
habit
to
be
able
to
tear
ourselves
abruptly
from
the
surroundings
with
which
we
have
been
obliged
to
be
familiar
for
many
months
that
outsiders
would
perhaps
pray
all
the
powers
of
goodness
to
preserve
them
from
such
surroundings
does
not
counteract
the
full
validity
of
this
rule
to
an
overwhelming
majority
of
our
framheim
will
certainly
appear
as
one
of
those
spots
on
our
planet
where
they
would
least
of
all
wish
to
find
themselves
a
hole
that
could
offer
nothing
but
the
very
climax
of
desolation
discomfort
and
boredom
to
us
nine
who
stood
on
the
gangway
ready
to
leave
this
place
things
appeared
somewhat
differently
that
strong
little
house
that
now
lay
entirely
hidden
beneath
the
snow
behind
mount
nelson
had
for
a
whole
year
been
our
home
and
a
thoroughly
good
and
comfortable
home
it
was
where
after
so
many
a
hard
day
work
we
had
found
all
the
rest
and
quiet
we
wanted
through
the
whole
antarctic
winter
and
it
is
a
winter
those
four
walls
had
protected
us
so
well
that
many
a
poor
wretch
in
milder
latitudes
would
have
envied
us
with
all
his
heart
if
he
could
have
seen
us
in
conditions
so
hard
that
every
form
of
life
flies
headlong
from
them
we
had
lived
on
at
framheim
undisturbed
and
untroubled
and
lived
be
it
said
not
as
animals
but
as
civilized
human
beings
who
had
always
within
their
reach
most
of
the
good
things
that
are
found
in
a
home
darkness
and
cold
reigned
outside
and
the
blizzards
no
doubt
did
their
best
to
blot
out
most
traces
of
our
activity
but
these
enemies
never
came
within
the
door
of
our
excellent
dwelling
there
we
shared
quarters
with
light
and
warmth
and
comfort
what
wonder
was
it
that
this
spot
exercised
a
strong
attraction
upon
each
of
us
at
the
moment
when
we
were
to
turn
our
backs
upon
it
for
good
outside
the
great
world
beckoned
to
us
that
is
true
and
it
might
have
much
to
offer
us
that
we
had
had
to
forego
for
a
long
time
but
in
what
awaited
us
there
was
certainly
a
great
deal
that
we
would
gladly
have
put
off
for
as
long
as
possible
when
everyday
life
came
with
its
cares
and
worries
it
might
well
happen
that
we
should
look
back
with
regret
to
our
peaceful
and
untroubled
existence
at
framheim
however
this
feeling
of
melancholy
was
hardly
so
strong
that
we
could
not
all
get
over
it
comparatively
quickly
judging
by
the
faces
at
any
rate
one
would
have
thought
that
joy
was
the
most
predominant
mood
and
why
not
it
was
no
use
dwelling
on
the
past
however
attractive
it
might
seem
just
then
and
as
to
the
future
we
had
every
right
to
expect
the
best
of
it
who
cared
to
think
of
coming
troubles
no
one
therefore
the
fram
was
dressed
with
flags
from
stem
to
stern
and
therefore
faces
beamed
at
each
other
as
we
said
to
our
home
on
the
barrier
we
could
leave
it
with
the
consciousness
that
the
object
of
our
year
stay
had
been
attained
and
after
all
this
consciousness
was
of
considerably
more
weight
than
the
thought
that
we
had
been
so
happy
there
one
thing
that
in
the
course
of
our
two
years
association
on
this
expedition
contributed
enormously
to
making
time
pass
easily
and
keeping
each
of
us
in
full
vigour
was
the
entire
absence
of
what
i
may
call
dead
periods
as
soon
as
one
problem
was
solved
another
instantly
appeared
no
sooner
was
one
goal
reached
than
the
next
one
beckoned
from
afar
in
this
way
we
always
had
our
hands
full
and
when
that
is
the
case
as
everyone
knows
time
flies
quickly
one
often
hears
it
asked
how
is
it
possible
to
make
the
time
pass
on
such
a
trip
my
good
friends
i
would
answer
if
anything
caused
us
worry
it
was
the
thought
of
how
we
should
find
time
enough
for
all
we
had
to
do
perhaps
to
many
this
assertion
will
bear
the
stamp
of
improbability
it
is
nevertheless
absolutely
true
those
who
have
read
this
narrative
through
will
in
any
case
have
received
the
impression
that
unemployment
was
an
evil
that
was
utterly
unknown
in
our
little
community
at
the
stage
where
we
now
found
ourselves
with
the
main
object
of
our
enterprise
achieved
there
might
have
been
reason
to
expect
a
certain
degree
of
relaxation
of
interest
this
however
was
not
the
case
the
fact
was
that
what
we
had
done
would
have
no
real
value
until
it
was
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
mankind
and
this
communication
had
to
be
made
with
as
little
loss
of
time
as
possible
if
anyone
was
interested
in
being
first
in
the
market
it
was
certainly
ourselves
the
probability
was
no
doubt
that
we
were
out
in
good
time
but
in
spite
of
all
it
was
only
a
probability
on
the
other
hand
it
was
absolutely
certain
that
we
had
a
voyage
of
nautical
miles
to
hobart
which
had
been
selected
as
our
first
port
of
call
and
it
was
almost
equally
certain
that
this
voyage
would
be
both
slow
and
troublesome
a
year
before
our
trip
through
ross
sea
had
turned
out
almost
like
a
pleasure
cruise
but
that
was
in
the
middle
of
summer
now
we
were
in
february
and
autumn
was
at
hand
as
regards
the
belt
of
captain
nilsen
thought
that
would
cause
us
no
delay
in
future
he
had
discovered
a
patent
and
infallible
way
of
getting
through
this
sounded
like
a
rather
bold
assertion
but
as
will
be
seen
later
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
our
worst
troubles
would
be
up
in
the
westerlies
where
we
should
this
time
be
exposed
to
the
unpleasant
possibility
of
having
to
beat
the
difference
in
longitude
between
the
bay
of
whales
and
hobart
is
nearly
fifty
degrees
if
we
could
have
sailed
off
this
difference
in
longitude
in
the
latitudes
where
we
then
were
and
where
a
degree
of
longitude
is
only
about
thirteen
nautical
miles
it
would
all
have
been
done
in
a
twinkling
but
the
mighty
mountain
ranges
of
north
victoria
land
were
a
decisive
obstacle
we
should
first
have
to
follow
a
northerly
course
until
we
had
rounded
the
antarctic
continent
northern
outpost
cape
adare
and
the
balleny
islands
to
the
north
of
it
not
till
then
would
the
way
be
open
for
us
to
work
to
the
west
but
then
we
should
be
in
a
region
where
in
all
probability
the
wind
would
be
dead
against
us
and
as
to
tacking
with
the
fram
no
thank
you
every
single
man
on
board
knew
enough
of
the
conditions
to
be
well
aware
of
what
awaited
us
and
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
thoughts
of
all
were
centred
upon
how
we
might
conquer
our
coming
difficulties
in
the
best
and
quickest
way
it
was
the
one
great
common
object
that
still
bound
and
would
continue
to
bind
us
all
together
in
our
joint
efforts
among
the
items
of
news
that
we
had
just
received
from
the
outer
world
was
the
message
that
the
australian
antarctic
expedition
under
douglas
mawson
would
be
glad
to
take
over
some
of
our
dogs
if
we
had
any
to
spare
the
base
of
this
expedition
was
hobart
and
as
far
as
that
went
this
suited
us
very
well
it
chanced
that
we
were
able
to
do
our
esteemed
colleague
this
small
service
on
leaving
the
barrier
we
could
show
a
pack
of
dogs
many
of
which
had
grown
up
during
our
year
stay
there
about
half
had
survived
the
whole
trip
from
norway
and
eleven
had
been
at
the
south
pole
it
had
been
our
intention
only
to
keep
a
suitable
number
as
the
progenitors
of
a
new
pack
for
the
approaching
voyage
in
the
arctic
ocean
but
mawson
request
caused
us
to
take
all
the
on
board
of
these
dogs
if
nothing
unforeseen
happened
we
should
be
able
to
make
over
to
him
when
the
last
load
was
brought
down
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
pull
the
dogs
over
the
side
and
then
we
were
ready
it
was
quite
curious
to
see
how
several
of
the
old
veterans
seemed
at
home
again
on
the
fram
deck
brave
dog
the
old
colonel
with
his
two
adjutants
suggen
and
arne
at
once
took
possession
of
the
places
where
they
had
stood
for
so
many
a
long
day
on
the
voyage
south
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
mainmast
the
two
twins
mylius
and
ring
helmer
hanssen
special
favourites
began
their
games
away
in
the
corner
of
the
to
port
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
look
at
those
two
merry
rascals
no
one
would
have
thought
they
had
trotted
at
the
head
of
the
whole
caravan
both
to
and
from
the
pole
one
solitary
dog
could
be
seen
stalking
about
lonely
and
reserved
in
a
continual
uneasy
search
this
was
the
boss
of
bjaaland
team
he
was
unaffected
by
any
advances
no
one
could
take
the
place
of
his
fallen
comrade
and
friend
frithjof
who
had
long
ago
found
a
grave
in
the
stomachs
of
his
companions
many
hundreds
of
miles
across
the
barrier
no
sooner
was
the
last
dog
helped
on
board
and
the
two
released
than
the
telegraph
rang
and
the
engine
was
at
once
set
going
to
keep
us
from
any
closer
contact
with
the
in
the
bay
of
whales
our
farewell
to
this
snug
harbour
took
almost
the
form
of
a
leap
from
one
world
to
another
the
fog
hung
over
us
as
thick
as
gruel
concealing
all
the
surrounding
outlines
behind
its
clammy
curtain
as
we
stood
out
after
a
lapse
of
three
or
four
hours
it
lifted
quite
suddenly
but
astern
of
us
the
bank
of
fog
still
stood
like
a
wall
behind
it
the
panorama
which
we
knew
would
have
looked
wonderful
in
clear
weather
and
which
we
should
so
gladly
have
let
our
eyes
rest
upon
as
long
as
we
could
was
entirely
concealed
the
same
course
we
had
steered
when
coming
in
a
year
before
could
safely
be
taken
in
the
opposite
direction
now
we
were
going
out
the
outlines
of
the
bay
had
remained
absolutely
unchanged
during
the
year
that
had
elapsed
even
the
most
projecting
point
of
the
wall
on
the
west
side
of
the
bay
cape
man
head
stood
serenely
in
its
old
place
and
it
looked
as
if
it
was
in
no
particular
hurry
to
remove
itself
it
will
probably
stay
where
it
is
for
many
a
long
day
yet
for
if
any
movement
of
the
ice
mass
is
taking
place
at
the
inner
end
of
the
bay
it
is
in
any
case
very
slight
only
in
one
respect
did
the
condition
of
things
differ
somewhat
this
year
from
the
preceding
whereas
in
the
greater
part
of
the
bay
was
free
of
as
early
as
january
in
there
was
no
opening
until
about
fourteen
days
later
the
had
stubbornly
held
on
until
the
fresh
breeze
that
appeared
on
the
very
day
the
southern
party
returned
had
rapidly
provided
a
channel
of
open
water
the
breaking
up
of
the
ice
could
not
possibly
have
taken
place
at
a
more
convenient
moment
the
breeze
in
question
saved
us
a
great
deal
both
of
time
and
trouble
as
the
way
to
the
place
where
the
fram
lay
before
the
ice
broke
up
was
about
five
times
as
long
as
the
distance
we
now
had
to
go
this
difference
of
fourteen
days
in
the
time
of
the
disappearance
of
the
ice
in
two
summers
showed
us
how
lucky
we
had
been
to
choose
that
particular
year
for
our
landing
here
the
work
which
we
carried
out
in
three
weeks
in
thanks
to
the
early
breaking
up
of
the
ice
would
certainly
have
taken
us
double
the
time
in
and
would
have
caused
us
far
more
difficulty
and
trouble
the
thick
fog
that
as
i
have
said
lay
over
the
bay
of
whales
when
we
left
it
prevented
us
also
from
seeing
what
our
friends
the
japanese
were
doing
the
kainan
maru
had
put
to
sea
in
company
with
the
fram
during
the
gale
of
january
and
since
that
time
we
had
seen
nothing
of
them
those
members
of
the
expedition
who
had
been
left
behind
in
a
tent
on
the
edge
of
the
barrier
to
the
north
of
framheim
had
also
been
very
retiring
of
late
on
the
day
we
left
the
place
one
of
our
own
party
had
an
interview
with
two
of
the
foreigners
prestrud
had
gone
to
fetch
the
flag
that
had
been
set
up
on
cape
man
head
as
a
signal
to
the
fram
that
all
had
returned
by
the
side
of
the
flag
a
tent
had
been
put
up
which
was
intended
as
a
shelter
for
a
lookout
man
in
case
the
fram
had
been
delayed
when
prestrud
came
up
he
was
no
doubt
rather
surprised
to
find
himself
face
to
face
with
two
sons
of
nippon
who
were
engaged
in
inspecting
our
tent
and
its
contents
which
however
only
consisted
of
a
and
a
primus
the
japanese
had
opened
the
conversation
with
enthusiastic
phrases
about
nice
day
and
plenty
ice
when
our
man
had
expressed
his
absolute
agreement
on
these
indisputable
facts
he
tried
to
get
information
on
matters
of
more
special
interest
the
two
strangers
told
him
that
for
the
moment
they
were
the
only
inhabitants
of
the
tent
out
on
the
edge
of
the
barrier
two
of
their
companions
had
gone
on
a
tour
into
the
barrier
to
make
meteorological
observations
and
were
to
be
away
about
a
week
the
kainan
maru
had
gone
on
another
cruise
in
the
direction
of
king
edward
land
as
far
as
they
knew
it
was
intended
that
the
ship
should
be
back
before
february
and
that
all
the
members
of
the
expedition
should
then
go
on
board
and
sail
to
the
north
prestrud
had
invited
his
two
new
acquaintances
to
visit
us
at
framheim
the
sooner
the
better
they
delayed
their
coming
too
long
however
for
us
to
be
able
to
wait
for
them
if
they
have
since
been
at
framheim
they
will
at
any
rate
be
able
to
bear
witness
that
we
did
our
best
to
make
things
comfortable
for
any
successors
when
the
fog
lifted
we
found
ourselves
surrounded
by
open
sea
practically
free
from
ice
on
all
sides
a
sea
with
a
heavy
dark
sky
above
it
is
not
usually
reckoned
among
the
sights
that
delight
the
eye
to
our
organs
of
vision
it
was
a
real
relief
to
come
into
surroundings
where
dark
colours
predominated
for
months
we
had
been
staring
at
a
dazzling
sea
of
white
where
artificial
means
had
constantly
to
be
employed
to
protect
the
eyes
against
the
excessive
flood
of
light
as
a
rule
it
was
even
necessary
to
limit
the
exposure
of
the
pupils
to
a
minimum
and
to
draw
the
eyelids
together
now
we
could
once
more
look
on
the
world
with
open
eyes
literally
without
winking
even
such
a
commonplace
thing
as
this
is
an
experience
in
one
life
ross
sea
showed
itself
again
on
its
most
favourable
side
a
cat
paw
of
wind
enabled
us
to
use
the
sails
so
that
after
a
lapse
of
two
days
we
were
already
about
two
hundred
miles
from
the
barrier
modest
as
this
distance
may
be
in
itself
when
seen
on
the
chart
it
looked
quite
imposing
in
our
eyes
it
must
be
remembered
that
with
the
means
of
transport
we
had
employed
on
land
it
cost
us
many
a
hard
day
march
to
cover
a
distance
of
two
hundred
geographical
miles
nilsen
had
marked
on
the
chart
the
limits
of
the
belt
of
during
the
three
passages
the
fram
had
already
made
the
supposition
that
an
available
opening
is
always
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
meridian
appears
to
be
confirmed
the
slight
changes
in
the
position
of
the
channel
were
only
caused
according
to
experiences
by
variations
in
the
direction
of
the
wind
he
had
found
that
it
always
answered
his
purpose
to
turn
and
try
to
windward
if
the
pack
showed
signs
of
being
close
this
mode
of
procedure
naturally
had
the
effect
of
making
the
course
somewhat
crooked
but
to
make
up
for
this
it
had
always
resulted
in
his
finding
open
water
on
this
trip
we
reached
the
edge
of
the
belt
three
days
after
leaving
the
barrier
the
position
of
the
belt
proved
to
be
very
nearly
the
same
as
on
previous
passages
after
we
had
held
our
course
for
some
hours
however
the
ice
became
so
thick
that
it
looked
badly
for
our
further
progress
now
was
the
time
to
try
nilsen
method
the
wind
which
by
the
way
was
quite
light
came
about
due
west
and
accordingly
the
helm
was
put
to
starboard
and
the
bow
turned
to
the
west
for
a
good
while
we
even
steered
true
south
but
it
proved
that
this
fairly
long
turn
had
not
been
made
in
vain
after
we
had
worked
our
way
to
windward
for
a
few
hours
we
found
openings
in
numbers
if
we
had
held
our
course
as
we
began
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
that
we
should
have
been
delayed
for
a
long
time
with
a
free
passage
a
few
miles
away
after
having
accomplished
this
first
long
turn
we
escaped
having
to
make
any
more
in
future
the
ice
continued
slack
and
on
february
the
rapidly
increasing
swell
told
us
that
we
had
done
with
the
antarctic
for
good
i
doubt
if
we
saw
a
single
seal
during
our
passage
through
the
this
time
and
if
we
had
seen
any
we
should
scarcely
have
allowed
the
time
for
shooting
them
there
was
plenty
of
good
food
both
for
men
and
dogs
this
time
without
our
having
recourse
to
for
the
dogs
we
had
brought
all
our
remaining
store
of
the
excellent
dogs
pemmican
and
that
was
not
a
little
besides
this
we
had
a
good
lot
of
dried
fish
they
had
fish
and
pemmican
on
alternate
days
on
this
diet
the
animals
kept
in
such
splendid
condition
that
when
on
arrival
at
hobart
they
had
shed
most
of
their
rough
winter
coats
they
looked
as
if
they
had
been
in
clover
for
a
year
for
the
nine
of
us
who
had
just
joined
the
ship
our
comrades
on
board
had
brought
all
the
way
from
buenos
aires
several
fat
pigs
that
were
now
living
in
luxury
in
their
pen
on
the
in
addition
to
these
three
fine
sheep
carcasses
hung
in
the
workroom
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
we
were
fully
capable
of
appreciating
these
unexpected
luxuries
no
doubt
had
done
excellent
service
but
this
did
not
prevent
roast
mutton
and
pork
being
a
welcome
change
especially
as
they
came
as
a
complete
surprise
i
hardly
think
one
of
us
had
counted
on
the
possibility
of
getting
fresh
meat
before
we
were
back
again
in
civilization
on
her
arrival
at
the
bay
of
whales
there
were
eleven
men
on
board
the
fram
all
included
instead
of
kutschin
and
nödtvedt
who
had
gone
home
from
buenos
aires
while
the
ship
was
there
in
the
autumn
of
three
new
men
were
engaged
namely
halvorsen
olsen
and
steller
the
two
were
from
bergen
steller
was
a
german
who
had
lived
for
several
years
in
norway
and
talked
norwegian
like
a
native
all
three
were
remarkably
efficient
and
friendly
men
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
any
dealings
with
them
i
venture
to
think
that
they
too
found
themselves
at
home
in
our
company
they
were
really
only
engaged
until
the
fram
called
at
the
first
port
but
they
stayed
on
board
all
the
way
to
buenos
aires
and
will
certainly
go
with
us
farther
still
when
the
shore
party
came
on
board
lieutenant
prestrud
took
up
his
old
position
as
first
officer
the
others
began
duty
at
once
all
told
we
were
now
twenty
men
on
board
and
after
the
fram
had
sailed
for
a
year
rather
she
could
now
be
said
to
have
a
full
crew
again
on
this
voyage
we
had
no
special
work
outside
the
usual
sea
routine
and
so
long
as
the
weather
was
fair
we
had
thus
a
comparatively
quiet
life
on
board
but
the
hours
of
watch
on
deck
passed
quickly
enough
i
expect
there
was
material
in
plenty
for
many
a
long
chat
now
if
we
who
came
from
land
showed
a
high
degree
of
curiosity
about
what
had
been
going
on
in
the
world
the
were
at
least
as
eager
to
have
full
information
of
every
detail
of
our
stay
on
the
barrier
one
must
almost
have
experienced
something
similar
oneself
to
be
able
to
form
an
idea
of
the
hail
of
questions
that
is
showered
upon
one
on
such
an
occasion
what
we
had
to
relate
has
been
given
in
outline
in
the
preceding
chapters
of
the
news
we
heard
from
outside
perhaps
nothing
interested
us
so
much
as
the
story
of
how
the
change
in
the
plan
of
the
expedition
had
been
received
at
home
and
abroad
it
must
have
been
at
least
a
week
before
there
was
any
noticeable
ebb
in
the
flood
of
questions
and
answers
that
week
went
by
quickly
perhaps
more
quickly
than
we
really
cared
for
since
it
proved
that
the
fram
was
not
really
able
to
keep
pace
with
time
the
weather
remained
quite
well
behaved
but
not
exactly
in
the
way
we
wished
we
had
reckoned
that
the
and
easterly
winds
so
frequent
around
framheim
would
also
show
themselves
out
in
ross
sea
but
they
entirely
forgot
to
do
so
we
had
little
wind
and
when
there
was
any
it
was
as
a
rule
a
slant
from
the
north
always
enough
to
delay
our
honest
old
ship
it
was
impossible
to
take
any
observations
for
the
first
eight
days
the
sky
was
continuously
overcast
if
one
occasionally
asked
the
skipper
about
her
position
he
usually
replied
that
the
only
thing
that
could
be
said
for
certain
was
that
we
were
in
ross
sea
on
february
however
according
to
a
fairly
good
noon
observation
we
were
well
to
the
north
of
cape
adare
and
therefore
beyond
the
limits
of
the
antarctic
continent
on
the
way
northward
we
passed
cape
adare
at
a
distance
hardly
greater
than
could
have
been
covered
with
a
good
day
sailing
but
our
desire
of
making
this
detour
had
to
give
way
to
the
chief
consideration
northward
northward
as
quickly
as
possible
there
is
usually
plenty
of
wind
in
the
neighbourhood
of
bold
promontories
and
cape
adare
is
no
exception
in
this
respect
it
is
well
known
as
a
centre
of
bad
weather
nor
did
we
slip
by
without
getting
a
taste
of
this
but
it
could
not
have
been
more
welcome
as
it
happened
that
the
wind
was
going
the
same
way
as
ourselves
two
days
of
fresh
wind
took
us
comparatively
quickly
past
the
balleny
islands
and
on
february
we
could
congratulate
ourselves
on
being
well
out
of
the
south
frigid
zone
it
was
with
joy
that
we
had
crossed
the
antarctic
circle
over
a
year
ago
going
south
perhaps
we
rejoiced
no
less
at
crossing
it
this
time
in
the
opposite
direction
in
the
bustle
of
getting
away
from
our
there
had
been
no
time
for
any
celebration
of
the
fortunate
reunion
of
the
land
and
sea
parties
as
this
occasion
for
festivity
had
been
let
slip
we
had
to
look
out
for
another
and
we
agreed
that
the
day
of
our
passage
from
the
frigid
to
the
temperate
zone
afforded
a
very
good
excuse
the
part
of
the
programme
was
extremely
simple
an
extra
cup
of
coffee
duly
accompanied
by
punch
and
cigars
and
some
music
on
the
gramophone
our
worthy
gramophone
could
not
offer
anything
that
had
the
interest
of
novelty
to
us
nine
who
had
wintered
at
framheim
we
knew
the
whole
repertoire
pretty
well
by
heart
but
the
melodies
awakened
memories
of
many
a
pleasant
saturday
evening
around
the
toddy
table
in
our
cosy
winter
home
down
at
the
head
of
the
bay
of
whales
memories
which
we
need
not
be
ashamed
of
recalling
on
board
the
fram
gramophone
music
had
not
been
heard
since
christmas
eve
and
the
members
of
the
sea
party
were
glad
enough
to
encore
more
than
one
number
outside
the
limits
of
the
programme
we
were
treated
to
an
extra
number
by
a
singer
who
imitated
the
gramophone
in
utilizing
a
big
megaphone
to
make
up
for
the
deficiencies
of
his
voice
according
to
his
own
statement
he
hid
behind
the
curtain
of
captain
nilsen
cabin
and
through
the
megaphone
came
a
ditty
intended
to
describe
life
on
the
barrier
from
its
humorous
side
it
was
completely
successful
and
we
again
had
a
laugh
that
did
us
good
performances
of
this
kind
of
course
only
have
a
value
to
those
who
have
taken
part
in
or
are
acquainted
with
the
events
to
which
they
refer
in
case
any
outsider
may
be
interested
in
seeing
what
our
entertainment
was
like
a
few
of
the
verses
are
given
here
it
must
be
remarked
that
the
author
composed
his
production
in
the
supposition
that
we
should
be
able
to
meet
by
christmas
and
he
therefore
proposed
that
for
the
moment
we
should
imagine
ourselves
to
be
celebrating
that
festival
we
made
no
difficulty
about
acceding
to
his
request
well
here
we
are
assembled
to
jollity
once
more
some
from
off
the
ocean
and
the
rest
from
off
the
shore
a
year
has
passed
since
last
we
met
and
all
are
safe
and
sound
then
let
us
banish
all
our
cares
and
join
our
hands
all
round
christmas
happy
christmas
let
us
pass
the
flowing
bowl
fill
your
glasses
all
and
let
make
sails
a
wee
bit
full
for
all
i
say
is
this
that
it
in
his
country
cause
if
he
staggers
just
a
little
it
is
in
his
country
cause
now
you
sailor
boys
shall
hear
about
the
time
we
have
gone
through
the
winter
well
it
was
long
we
had
so
much
to
do
there
was
digging
snow
and
sleeping
you
can
bet
we
good
at
that
and
eating
too
no
wonder
that
we
all
a
little
fat
we
had
hot
cakes
for
our
breakfast
and
hermetik
each
day
mutton
pies
ragouts
and
curries
for
that
is
lindström
way
but
all
i
say
is
this
that
was
in
our
country
cause
if
we
stuffed
ourselves
with
dainties
it
was
in
our
country
cause
september
came
and
off
we
went
that
trip
was
pretty
tough
our
compasses
all
went
on
strike
they
thought
it
cold
enough
the
brandy
in
the
captain
flask
froze
to
a
lump
of
ice
we
all
agreed
both
men
and
dogs
such
weather
was
nice
so
back
we
went
to
framheim
to
thaw
our
heels
and
toes
it
could
not
be
quite
healthy
when
our
feet
and
fingers
froze
but
all
i
say
is
this
that
was
in
our
country
cause
and
we
did
not
mind
a
when
was
in
our
country
cause
the
sun
came
up
and
warmed
us
then
a
little
day
by
day
five
men
went
out
again
and
toiled
along
the
southern
way
this
time
they
conquered
snow
and
ice
and
all
the
world
may
hear
that
norway
flag
flies
at
the
pole
now
boys
a
ringing
cheer
for
him
who
led
them
forward
through
the
mountains
and
the
plain
up
to
the
goal
they
aimed
at
and
safely
back
again
but
all
i
say
is
this
that
was
in
his
country
cause
if
he
went
through
and
won
the
pole
was
in
his
country
cause
it
could
soon
be
noticed
in
one
way
and
another
that
we
had
reached
latitudes
where
existence
took
a
very
different
aspect
from
what
we
had
been
accustomed
to
south
of
the
parallel
one
welcome
change
was
the
rise
in
temperature
the
mercury
now
climbed
well
above
and
those
individuals
on
board
who
were
still
more
or
less
clad
in
skins
shed
the
last
remnants
of
their
polar
garb
for
a
lighter
and
more
convenient
costume
those
who
waited
longest
before
making
the
change
were
the
ones
who
belonged
to
the
shore
party
the
numerous
people
who
imagine
that
a
long
stay
in
the
polar
regions
makes
a
man
less
susceptible
of
cold
than
other
mortals
are
completely
mistaken
the
direct
opposite
is
more
likely
to
be
the
case
a
man
who
stays
some
time
in
a
place
where
the
everyday
temperature
is
down
in
the
fifties
below
zero
or
more
than
that
will
not
trouble
himself
greatly
about
the
cold
so
long
as
he
has
good
and
serviceable
skin
clothing
let
the
same
man
rigged
out
in
civilized
clothes
be
suddenly
put
down
in
the
streets
of
christiania
on
a
winter
day
with
thirty
or
degrees
of
frost
and
the
poor
teeth
will
chatter
till
they
fall
out
of
his
mouth
the
fact
is
that
on
a
polar
trip
one
defends
oneself
effectively
against
the
cold
when
one
comes
back
and
has
to
go
about
with
the
protection
afforded
by
an
overcoat
a
stiff
collar
and
a
hard
hat
well
then
one
feels
it
a
less
welcome
consequence
of
the
difference
in
latitude
was
the
darkening
of
the
nights
it
may
be
admitted
that
continual
daylight
would
be
unpleasant
in
the
long
run
ashore
but
aboard
ship
an
everlasting
day
would
certainly
be
preferred
if
such
a
thing
could
be
had
even
if
we
might
now
consider
that
we
had
done
with
the
principal
mass
of
antarctic
ice
we
still
had
to
reckon
with
its
disagreeable
outposts
the
icebergs
it
has
already
been
remarked
that
a
practised
man
can
see
the
blink
of
one
of
the
larger
bergs
a
long
way
off
in
the
dark
but
when
it
is
a
question
of
one
of
the
smaller
masses
of
ice
of
which
only
an
inconsiderable
part
rises
above
the
surface
there
is
no
such
brightness
and
therefore
no
warning
a
little
lump
like
this
is
just
as
dangerous
as
a
big
berg
you
run
the
same
risks
in
a
possible
collision
of
knocking
a
hole
in
the
bows
or
carrying
away
the
rigging
in
these
transitional
regions
where
the
temperature
of
the
water
is
always
very
low
the
thermometer
is
a
very
doubtful
guide
the
waters
in
which
we
were
sailing
are
not
yet
so
well
known
as
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
meeting
with
land
captain
colbeck
who
commanded
one
of
the
relief
ships
sent
south
during
scott
first
expedition
came
quite
unexpectedly
upon
a
little
island
to
the
east
of
cape
adare
this
island
was
afterwards
named
after
captain
scott
when
captain
colbeck
made
his
discovery
he
was
about
on
the
course
that
has
usually
been
taken
by
ships
whose
destination
was
within
the
limits
of
ross
sea
there
is
still
a
possibility
that
in
going
out
of
one
course
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
one
may
find
more
groups
of
islands
in
that
part
on
the
current
charts
of
the
south
pacific
there
are
marked
several
archipelagoes
and
islands
the
position
of
which
is
not
a
little
doubtful
one
of
these
emerald
island
is
charted
as
lying
almost
directly
in
the
course
we
had
to
follow
to
reach
hobart
captain
davis
who
took
shackleton
ship
the
nimrod
home
to
england
in
sailed
however
right
over
the
point
where
emerald
island
should
be
found
according
to
the
chart
without
seeing
anything
of
it
if
it
exists
at
all
it
is
at
any
rate
incorrectly
charted
in
order
to
avoid
its
vicinity
and
still
more
in
order
to
get
as
far
as
possible
to
the
west
before
we
came
into
the
westerly
belt
proper
we
pressed
on
as
much
as
we
could
for
one
hard
week
or
perhaps
nearer
two
but
a
continual
wind
seemed
for
a
long
time
to
leave
us
only
two
disagreeable
possibilities
either
of
drifting
to
the
eastward
or
of
finding
ourselves
down
in
the
to
the
north
of
wilkes
land
those
weeks
were
a
very
severe
trial
of
patience
to
the
many
on
board
who
were
burning
with
eagerness
to
get
ashore
with
our
news
and
perhaps
to
hear
some
in
return
when
the
first
three
weeks
of
february
were
past
we
were
not
much
more
than
with
anything
like
favourable
conditions
we
ought
to
have
arrived
by
that
time
the
optimists
always
consoled
us
by
saying
that
sooner
or
later
there
would
be
a
change
for
the
better
and
at
last
it
came
a
good
spell
of
favourable
wind
took
us
at
a
bound
well
to
the
windward
both
of
the
doubtful
emerald
island
and
of
the
authentic
macquarie
group
to
the
north
of
it
it
may
be
mentioned
in
passing
that
at
the
time
we
went
by
the
most
southerly
wireless
telegraphy
station
in
the
world
was
located
on
one
of
the
macquarie
islands
the
installation
belonged
to
mawson
antarctic
expedition
mawson
also
took
with
him
apparatus
for
installing
a
station
on
the
antarctic
continent
itself
but
so
far
as
is
known
no
connection
was
accomplished
the
first
year
during
this
fortunate
run
we
had
come
so
far
to
the
west
that
our
course
to
hobart
was
rapidly
approaching
true
north
on
the
other
hand
we
should
have
liked
to
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
prevailing
winds
the
westerlies
these
vary
little
from
one
year
to
another
and
we
found
them
much
the
same
as
we
had
been
accustomed
to
before
frequent
stiff
breezes
from
the
which
generally
held
for
about
twelve
hours
and
then
veered
to
west
or
so
long
as
the
was
blowing
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
lie
to
with
shortened
sail
when
the
change
of
wind
came
we
made
a
few
hours
progress
in
the
right
direction
in
this
way
we
crept
step
by
step
northward
to
our
destination
it
was
slow
enough
no
doubt
but
every
day
the
line
of
our
course
on
the
chart
grew
a
little
longer
and
towards
the
end
of
february
the
distance
between
us
and
the
southern
point
of
tasmania
had
shrunk
to
very
modest
dimensions
with
the
constant
heavy
westerly
swell
the
fram
light
as
she
now
was
surpassed
herself
in
rolling
and
that
is
indeed
saying
a
great
deal
this
rolling
brought
us
a
little
damage
to
the
rigging
the
gaff
of
the
mainsail
breaking
however
that
affair
did
not
stop
us
long
the
broken
spar
was
quickly
replaced
by
a
spare
gaff
our
hopes
of
arriving
before
the
end
of
february
came
to
naught
and
a
quarter
of
march
went
by
before
our
voyage
was
at
an
end
on
the
afternoon
of
march
we
had
our
first
glimpse
of
land
but
as
the
weather
was
by
no
means
clear
and
we
had
not
been
able
to
determine
our
longitude
with
certainty
for
two
days
we
were
uncertain
which
point
of
tasmania
we
had
before
us
to
explain
the
situation
a
short
description
of
the
is
necessary
the
southern
angle
of
tasmania
runs
out
in
three
promontories
off
the
easternmost
of
these
and
only
divided
from
it
by
a
very
narrow
channel
lies
a
steep
and
apparently
inaccessible
island
called
tasman
island
it
is
however
accessible
for
on
the
top
of
it
feet
above
the
sea
stands
a
lighthouse
the
middle
promontory
is
called
tasman
head
and
between
this
and
the
eastern
one
we
have
storm
bay
which
forms
the
approach
to
hobart
there
then
lay
our
course
the
question
was
which
of
the
three
heads
we
had
sighted
this
was
difficult
or
rather
impossible
to
decide
so
indistinct
was
the
outline
of
the
land
in
the
misty
air
it
was
also
entirely
unknown
to
us
as
not
one
of
us
had
ever
before
been
in
this
corner
of
the
world
when
darkness
came
on
a
heavy
rain
set
in
and
without
being
able
to
see
anything
at
all
we
lay
there
feeling
our
way
all
night
with
the
appearance
of
daylight
a
fresh
wind
came
and
swept
away
most
of
the
rain
so
that
we
could
again
make
out
the
land
we
decided
that
what
we
saw
was
the
middle
promontory
tasman
head
and
gaily
set
our
course
into
storm
bay
as
we
thought
with
the
rapidly
strengthening
breeze
we
went
spinningly
and
the
possibility
of
reaching
hobart
in
a
few
hours
began
to
appear
as
a
dead
certainty
with
this
comfortable
feeling
we
had
just
sat
down
to
the
breakfast
table
in
the
when
the
door
was
pulled
open
with
what
seemed
unnecessary
violence
and
the
face
of
the
officer
of
the
watch
appeared
in
the
doorway
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
head
was
the
sinister
message
and
the
face
disappeared
to
our
pleasant
plans
to
our
breakfast
all
hands
went
on
deck
at
once
and
it
was
seen
only
too
well
that
the
melancholy
information
was
correct
we
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
thick
rain
the
wind
that
had
now
increased
to
a
stiff
breeze
had
chased
the
from
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
on
the
point
we
had
taken
for
tasman
head
we
now
saw
the
lighthouse
it
was
therefore
tasman
island
and
instead
of
being
in
storm
bay
we
were
out
in
the
open
pacific
far
to
leeward
of
the
infamous
headland
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
beat
and
attempt
to
work
our
way
back
to
windward
although
we
knew
it
would
be
practically
labour
in
vain
the
breeze
increased
to
a
gale
and
instead
of
making
any
headway
we
had
every
prospect
of
drifting
well
to
leeward
that
was
the
usual
result
of
trying
to
beat
with
the
fram
rather
annoyed
though
we
were
we
set
to
work
to
do
what
could
be
done
and
with
every
square
foot
of
canvas
set
the
fram
pitched
on
her
way
to
begin
with
it
looked
as
if
we
held
our
own
more
or
less
but
as
the
distance
from
land
increased
and
the
wind
got
more
force
our
bearings
soon
showed
us
that
we
were
going
the
way
the
hen
kicks
about
midday
we
went
about
and
stood
in
towards
land
again
immediately
after
came
a
violent
squall
which
tore
the
outer
jib
to
ribbons
with
that
we
were
also
obliged
to
take
in
the
mainsail
otherwise
it
would
pretty
soon
have
been
caught
aback
and
there
would
have
been
further
damage
to
the
rigging
with
the
remaining
sails
any
further
attempt
was
useless
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
get
as
close
under
the
lee
of
the
land
as
we
could
and
try
with
the
help
of
the
engine
to
hold
our
own
till
the
weather
moderated
how
it
blew
that
afternoon
one
gust
after
another
came
dancing
down
the
slopes
of
the
hills
and
tore
at
the
rigging
till
the
whole
vessel
shook
the
feeling
on
board
was
as
might
be
expected
somewhat
sultry
and
found
an
outlet
in
various
expressions
the
reverse
of
gentle
wind
weather
fate
and
life
in
general
were
inveighed
against
but
this
availed
little
the
peninsula
that
separated
us
from
storm
bay
still
lay
there
firm
and
immovable
and
the
gale
went
on
as
if
it
was
in
no
hurry
to
let
us
get
round
the
whole
day
went
by
and
the
greater
part
of
the
night
without
any
change
taking
place
not
till
the
morning
of
the
did
our
prospects
begin
to
improve
the
wind
became
lighter
and
went
more
to
the
south
that
was
of
course
the
way
we
had
to
go
but
by
hugging
the
shore
where
we
had
perfectly
smooth
water
we
succeeded
in
working
our
way
down
to
tasman
island
before
darkness
fell
the
night
brought
a
calm
and
that
gave
us
our
chance
the
engine
worked
furiously
and
a
slight
favourable
current
contributed
to
set
us
on
our
way
by
dawn
on
the
we
were
far
up
storm
bay
and
could
at
last
consider
ourselves
masters
of
the
situation
it
was
a
sunny
day
and
our
faces
shone
in
rivalry
with
the
sun
all
trace
of
the
last
two
days
annoyances
had
vanished
and
soon
the
fram
too
began
to
shine
the
white
paint
on
deck
had
a
thorough
overhauling
with
soap
and
water
in
strong
solution
the
ripolin
was
again
as
fresh
as
when
new
when
this
had
been
seen
to
the
outward
appearance
of
the
men
also
began
to
undergo
a
striking
change
the
iceland
jackets
and
blanket
costumes
from
horten
gave
way
to
shore
clothes
of
the
most
varied
cut
hauled
out
after
a
two
years
rest
razors
and
scissors
had
made
a
rich
harvest
and
sailmaker
fashionable
burberry

figured
on
most
heads
even
lindström
who
up
to
date
had
held
the
position
among
the
land
party
of
being
its
heaviest
fattest
and
blackest
member
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
in
close
contact
with
water
meanwhile
we
were
nearing
a
pilot
station
and
a
bustling
little
motor
launch
swung
alongside
want
a
pilot
captain
one
positively
started
at
the
sound
of
the
first
new
human
voice
communication
with
the
outer
world
was
again
established
the
pilot
a
brisk
old
man
looked
about
him
in
surprise
when
he
came
up
on
to
our
deck
i
should
never
have
imagined
things
were
so
clean
and
bright
on
board
a
polar
ship
he
said
nor
should
i
have
thought
from
the
look
of
you
that
you
had
come
from
antarctica
you
look
as
if
you
had
had
nothing
but
a
good
time
we
could
assure
him
of
that
but
as
to
the
rest
it
was
not
our
intention
just
yet
to
allow
ourselves
to
be
pumped
and
the
old
man
could
see
that
he
had
no
objection
to
our
pumping
him
though
he
had
no
very
great
store
of
news
to
give
us
he
had
heard
nothing
of
the
terra
nova
on
the
other
hand
he
was
able
to
tell
us
that
mawson
ship
the
aurora
commanded
by
captain
davis
might
be
expected
at
hobart
any
day
they
had
been
looking
out
for
the
fram
since
the
beginning
of
february
and
had
given
us
up
long
ago
that
was
a
surprise
anyhow
our
guest
evidently
had
no
desire
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
our
cuisine
at
any
rate
he
very
energetically
declined
our
invitation
to
breakfast
presumably
he
was
afraid
of
being
treated
to
flesh
or
similar
original
dishes
on
the
other
hand
he
showed
great
appreciation
of
our
norwegian
tobacco
he
had
his
handbag
pretty
nearly
full
when
he
left
us
hobart
town
lies
on
the
bank
of
the
derwent
river
which
runs
into
storm
bay
the
surroundings
are
beautiful
and
the
soil
evidently
extremely
fertile
but
woods
and
fields
were
almost
burnt
up
on
our
arrival
a
prolonged
drought
had
prevailed
and
made
an
end
of
all
green
things
to
our
eyes
it
was
however
an
unmixed
delight
to
look
upon
meadows
and
woods
even
if
their
colours
were
not
absolutely
fresh
we
were
not
very
difficult
to
please
on
that
score
the
harbour
of
hobart
is
an
almost
ideal
one
large
and
remarkably
well
protected
as
we
approached
the
town
the
usual
procession
of
doctor
and
officers
came
aboard
the
doctor
soon
saw
that
there
was
no
work
for
his
department
and
the
officers
were
easily
convinced
that
we
had
no
contraband
goods
the
anchor
was
dropped
and
we
were
free
to
land
i
took
my
cablegrams
and
accompanied
the
ashore
chapter
xv
the
eastern
sledge
journey
by
lieutenant
prestrud
on
october
the
southern
party
started
on
their
long
journey
the
departure
took
place
without
much
ceremony
and
with
the
smallest
possible
expenditure
of
words
a
hearty
grasp
of
the
hand
serves
the
purpose
quite
as
well
on
such
occasions
i
accompanied
them
to
the
place
we
called
the
on
the
south
side
of
the
bay
after
a
final
good
luck
to
our
chief
and
comrades
as
sincere
a
wish
as
i
have
ever
bestowed
upon
anyone
i
cinematographed
the
caravan
and
very
soon
after
it
was
out
of
sight
those
fellows
went
southward
at
a
great
pace
helmer
hanssen
team
leading
as
usual
there
i
stood
utterly
alone
and
i
can
not
deny
that
i
was
a
prey
to
somewhat
mixed
feelings
when
should
we
see
those
five
again
who
had
just
disappeared
from
view
on
the
boundless
plain
and
in
what
conditions
what
sort
of
a
report
would
they
bring
of
the
result
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
guesses
here
and
abundant
opportunity
for
weighing
every
possibility
good
and
bad
but
there
was
very
little
to
be
gained
by
indulging
in
speculations
of
that
sort
the
immediate
facts
first
claimed
attention
one
fact
amongst
others
was
that
framheim
was
a
good
three
miles
away
another
was
that
the
cinematograph
apparatus
weighed
a
good
many
pounds
and
a
third
that
lindström
would
be
mightily
put
out
if
i
arrived
too
late
for
dinner
our
chef
insisted
on
a
high
standard
of
punctuality
in
the
matter
of
homeward
then
at
the
best
speed
possible
the
speed
however
was
not
particularly
good
and
i
began
to
prepare
for
the
consequences
of
a
long
delay
on
the
other
side
of
the
bay
i
could
just
make
out
a
little
black
speck
that
seemed
to
be
in
motion
towards
me
i
thought
at
first
it
was
a
seal
but
fortunately
it
turned
out
to
be
jörgen
stubberud
with
six
dogs
and
a
sledge
this
was
quite
encouraging
in
the
first
place
i
should
get
rid
of
my
unmanageable
burden
and
in
the
second
i
might
expect
to
get
on
faster
team
consisted
however
of
four
intractable
puppies
besides
puss
and
another
courser
of
similar
breed
the
result
was
that
our
pace
was
a
modest
one
and
our
course
anything
but
straight
so
that
we
arrived
at
framheim
two
hours
after
the
time
appointed
for
dinner
those
who
know
anything
of
master
lindström
and
his
disposition
will
easily
be
able
from
this
explanation
to
form
an
idea
of
his
state
of
mind
at
the
moment
when
we
entered
the
door
yes
he
was
undoubtedly
angry
but
we
were
at
least
equally
hungry
and
if
anything
can
soften
the
heart
of
a
norwegian
caterer
it
is
a
ravenous
appetite
in
those
he
has
to
feed
provided
of
course
that
he
have
enough
to
offer
them
and
lindström
supplies
were
practically
unlimited
i
remember
that
dinner
well
at
the
same
table
where
eight
of
us
had
sat
for
so
many
months
there
were
now
only
three
left
johansen
stubberud
and
i
we
had
more
room
it
is
true
but
that
gain
was
a
poor
satisfaction
we
missed
those
who
had
gone
very
badly
and
our
thoughts
were
always
following
them
the
first
thing
we
discussed
on
this
occasion
was
how
many
miles
they
might
be
expected
to
do
that
day
nor
was
this
the
last
dispute
we
had
on
the
same
theme
during
the
weeks
and
months
that
followed
it
was
constantly
to
the
fore
and
gave
plenty
of
material
for
conversation
when
we
had
exhausted
our
own
concerns
as
regards
these
latter
my
instructions
were
to
go
to
king
edward
vii
land
and
there
carry
out
what
exploration
time
and
circumstances
might
permit
to
survey
and
map
the
bay
of
whales
and
its
immediate
surroundings
as
far
as
possible
to
keep
the
station
at
framheim
in
order
in
case
we
might
have
to
spend
another
winter
there
as
regards
time
my
orders
were
to
be
back
at
framheim
before
we
could
reasonably
expect
the
arrival
of
the
fram
this
was
and
would
necessarily
remain
somewhat
uncertain
no
doubt
we
all
had
a
great
idea
of
the
fram
capacity
for
keeping
time
and
lieutenant
nilsen
had
announced
his
intention
of
being
back
by
christmas
or
the
new
year
but
nevertheless
a
year
is
a
long
time
and
there
are
many
miles
in
a
trip
round
the
world
if
we
assumed
that
no
mishap
had
occurred
to
the
fram
and
that
she
had
left
buenos
aires
at
the
time
fixed
in
the
plan
october
she
would
in
all
probability
be
able
to
arrive
at
the
bay
of
whales
about
the
middle
of
january
on
the
basis
of
this
calculation
we
decided
if
possible
to
get
the
sledge
journey
to
king
edward
land
done
before
christmas
while
the
surveying
work
around
the
bay
would
have
to
be
postponed
to
the
first
half
of
january
i
thought
however
seeing
the
advantages
of
working
while
the
bay
was
still
frozen
over
that
it
would
pay
to
devote
a
few
days
immediately
following
the
departure
of
the
southern
party
to
the
preparatory
work
of
measuring
but
this
did
not
pay
at
all
we
had
reckoned
without
the
weather
and
in
consequence
were
well
taken
in
when
one
thinks
over
it
afterwards
it
seems
reasonable
enough
that
the
final
victory
of
mild
weather
over
the
remains
of
the
antarctic
winter
can
not
be
accomplished
without
serious
disturbances
of
the
atmospheric
conditions
the
expulsion
of
one
evil
has
to
be
effected
by
the
help
of
another
and
the
weather
was
bad
with
a
vengeance
during
the
two
weeks
that
followed
october
there
were
only
three
or
four
days
that
offered
any
chance
of
working
with
the
theodolite
and
we
managed
to
get
a
measured
metres
long
and
to
lay
out
the
greater
part
of
the
east
side
of
the
bay
as
well
as
the
most
prominent
points
round
the
camp
but
one
had
positively
to
snatch
one
opportunities
by
stealth
and
every
excursion
ended
regularly
in
bringing
the
instruments
home
well
covered
with
snow
if
the
bad
weather
thus
put
hindrances
in
the
way
of
the
work
we
were
anxious
to
do
it
made
up
for
it
by
providing
us
with
a
lot
of
extra
work
which
we
could
very
well
have
done
without
there
was
incessant
shovelling
of
snow
to
keep
any
sort
of
passage
open
to
the
four
that
were
left
standing
as
well
as
to
our
own
underground
dwelling
over
which
the
snow
covering
had
been
growing
constantly
higher
the
fairly
high
wall
that
we
had
originally
built
on
the
east
side
of
the
entrance
door
was
now
entirely
buried
in
the
it
had
given
us
good
protection
now
the
drift
had
unimpeded
access
and
the
opening
like
the
descent
into
a
cellar
that
led
down
to
the
door
was
filled
up
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
when
the
wind
was
in
the
right
quarter
lindström
shook
his
head
when
we
sometimes
asked
him
how
he
would
get
on
by
himself
if
the
weather
continued
in
this
way
so
long
as
there
nothing
but
snow
in
the
way
i
manage
to
get
out
said
he
one
day
he
came
and
told
us
that
he
could
no
longer
get
at
the
coal
and
on
further
investigation
it
looked
rather
difficult
the
roof
of
the
place
where
the
coal
was
stored
had
yielded
to
the
pressure
of
the
mass
of
snow
and
the
whole
edifice
had
collapsed
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
set
to
work
at
once
and
after
a
great
deal
of
hard
labour
we
got
the
remainder
of
the
precious
fuel
moved
into
the
long
snow
tunnel
that
led
from
the
house
to
the
with
that
our
black
diamonds
were
in
safety
for
the
time
being
this
job
made
us
about
as
black
as
the
diamonds
when
we
came
in
the
cook
as
it
happened
had
just
been
doing
a
big
wash
on
his
own
account
a
comparatively
rare
event
and
there
was
surprise
on
both
sides
the
cook
was
as
much
taken
aback
at
seeing
us
so
black
as
we
were
at
seeing
him
so
clean
all
the
that
resulted
from
the
continued
bad
weather
in
conjunction
with
the
necessary
preparations
for
the
sledge
journey
gave
us
plenty
of
occupation
but
i
will
venture
to
say
that
none
of
us
would
care
to
go
through
those
days
again
we
were
delayed
in
our
real
work
and
delay
which
is
unpleasant
enough
in
any
circumstances
was
all
the
more
unwelcome
down
here
where
time
is
so
precious
as
we
only
had
two
sledges
on
which
to
transport
supplies
for
three
men
and
sixteen
dogs
besides
all
our
outfit
and
as
on
our
trip
we
should
have
no
depots
to
fall
back
on
the
duration
of
the
journey
could
not
be
extended
much
beyond
six
weeks
in
order
to
be
back
again
by
christmas
we
had
therefore
to
leave
before
the
middle
of
november
it
would
do
no
harm
however
to
be
off
before
this
and
as
soon
as
november
arrived
we
took
the
first
opportunity
of
disappearing
on
account
of
getting
on
the
right
course
we
preferred
that
the
start
should
take
place
in
clear
weather
the
fact
was
that
we
were
obliged
to
go
round
by
the
depot
in
as
king
edward
land
lies
to
the
east
or
rather
of
framheim
this
was
a
considerable
detour
it
had
to
be
made
because
in
september
we
had
left
at
this
depot
all
the
packed
sledging
provisions
a
good
deal
of
our
personal
equipment
and
finally
some
of
the
necessary
instruments
on
the
way
to
the
depot
about
thirty
geographical
miles
south
of
framheim
we
had
the
nasty
crevassed
surface
that
had
been
met
with
for
the
first
time
on
the
third
depot
journey
in
the
autumn
of
in
the
month
of
april
at
that
time
we
came
upon
it
altogether
unawares
and
it
was
somewhat
remarkable
that
we
escaped
from
it
with
the
loss
of
two
dogs
this
broken
surface
lay
in
a
depression
about
a
mile
to
the
west
of
the
route
originally
marked
out
but
however
it
may
have
been
it
seems
ever
since
that
time
to
have
exercised
an
irresistible
attraction
on
our
first
attempt
to
go
south
in
september
we
came
right
into
the
middle
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
then
perfectly
clear
i
afterwards
heard
that
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
the
southern
party
on
their
last
trip
landed
in
this
dangerous
region
and
that
one
man
had
a
very
narrow
escape
of
falling
in
with
sledge
and
dogs
i
had
no
wish
to
expose
myself
to
the
risk
of
such
accidents
at
any
rate
while
we
were
on
familiar
ground
that
would
have
been
a
bad
beginning
to
my
first
independent
piece
of
work
as
a
polar
explorer
a
day
or
two
of
fine
weather
to
begin
with
would
enable
us
to
follow
the
line
originally
marked
out
and
thus
keep
safe
ground
under
our
feet
until
the
ugly
place
was
passed
in
the
opening
days
of
november
the
weather
conditions
began
to
improve
somewhat
in
any
case
there
was
not
the
continual
driving
snow
lindström
asked
us
before
we
left
to
bring
up
a
sufficient
quantity
of
seals
to
save
him
that
work
as
long
as
possible
the
supply
we
had
had
during
the
winter
was
almost
exhausted
there
was
only
a
certain
amount
of
blubber
left
we
thought
it
only
fair
to
accede
to
his
wish
as
it
is
an
awkward
business
to
transport
those
heavy
beasts
alone
especially
when
one
has
only
a
pack
of
unbroken
puppies
to
drive
we
afterwards
heard
that
lindström
had
some
amusing
experiences
with
them
during
the
time
he
was
left
alone
leaving
the
transport
out
of
the
question
this
is
a
very
tame
sport
an
old
arctic
hand
or
an
eskimo
would
certainly
be
astounded
to
see
the
placid
calm
with
which
the
antarctic
seal
allows
itself
to
be
shot
and
cut
up
to
them
antarctica

which
the

allows

to

shot
and
cut
up
to
them
antarctica
would
but
it
seldom
removes
itself
many
yards
at
a
time
for
the
motions
of
the
seal
are
just
as
clumsy
and
slow
on
land
as
they
are
active
and
swift
in
the
water
when
it
has
crawled
with
great
pains
to
a
little
distance
there
is
no
sign
that
the
interruption
has
made
any
lasting
impression
on
it
it
looks
more
as
if
it
took
it
all
as
an
unpleasant
dream
or
nightmare
which
it
would
be
best
to
sleep
off
as
soon
as
possible
if
one
shoots
a
single
seal
this
may
happen
without
those
lying
round
so
much
as
raising
their
heads
indeed
we
could
open
and
cut
up
a
seal
right
before
the
noses
of
its
companions
without
this
making
the
slightest
impression
on
them
about
the
beginning
of
november
the
seals
began
to
have
their
young
so
far
as
we
could
make
out
the
females
kept
out
of
the
water
for
several
days
without
taking
any
food
until
the
young
one
was
big
enough
to
be
able
to
go
to
sea
otherwise
it
did
not
seem
that
the
mothers
cared
very
much
for
their
little
ones
some
it
is
true
made
a
sort
of
attempt
to
protect
their
offspring
if
they
were
disturbed
but
the
majority
simply
left
their
young
ones
in
the
lurch
as
far
as
we
were
concerned
we
left
the
females
and
their
young
as
much
as
possible
in
peace
we
killed
two
or
three
seals
to
get
the
skins
for
our
collection
it
was
another
matter
with
the
dogs
with
them
was
far
too
favourite
a
sport
for
the
opportunity
to
be
neglected
against
a
seal
however
they
could
do
nothing
its
body
offered
no
particularly
vulnerable
spots
and
the
thick
skin
was
too
much
even
for
teeth
the
utmost
the
rascals
could
accomplish
was
to
annoy
and
torment
the
object
of
their
attack
it
was
quite
another
matter
when
the
young
ones
began
to
arrive
among
this
small
game
the
enterprising
hunters
could
easily
satisfy
their
inborn
craving
for
murder
for
the
scoundrels
only
killed
for
the
sake
of
killing
they
were
not
at
all
hungry
as
they
had
as
much
food
as
they
liked
of
course
we
did
all
we
could
to
put
a
stop
to
this
state
of
things
and
so
long
as
there
were
several
of
us
at
the
hut
we
saw
that
the
whole
pack
was
tied
up
but
when
lindström
was
left
by
himself
he
could
not
manage
to
hold
them
fast
his
tents
were
altogether
snowed
under
in
the
weather
that
prevailed
on
the
seaboard
in
december
there
were
not
many
dogs
left
in
his
charge
but
i
am
afraid
those
few
wrought
great
havoc
among
the
young
seals
out
on
the
ice
of
the
bay
the
poor
mothers
could
hardly
have
done
anything
against
a
lot
of
dogs
even
if
they
had
been
more
courageous
their
enemies
were
too
active
for
them
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
to
snatch
the
young
one
from
the
side
of
its
mother
and
then
they
were
able
to
take
the
poor
thing
life
undisturbed
unfortunately
there
were
no
in
the
neighbourhood
of
framheim
these
which
are
far
quicker
in
their
movements
than
the
weddell
seal
and
are
moreover
furnished
with
a
formidable
set
of
teeth
would
certainly
have
made
the
more
careful
in
their
behaviour
after
we
had
brought
up
to
the
house
enough
seals
carcasses
to
keep
the
ten
or
twelve
dogs
that
would
be
left
supplied
for
a
good
while
and
had
cut
up
a
sufficient
quantity
for
our
own
use
on
the
way
to
we
took
the
first
opportunity
of
getting
away
before
i
pass
on
to
give
an
account
of
our
trip
i
wish
to
say
a
few
words
about
my
companions
johansen
and
stubberud
it
goes
without
saying
that
it
gave
me
as
a
beginner
a
great
feeling
of
security
to
have
with
me
such
a
man
as
johansen
who
possessed
many
years
experience
of
all
that
pertains
to
sledging
expeditions
and
as
regards
stubberud
i
could
not
have
wished
for
a
better
travelling
companion
than
him
either
a
fellow
steady
and
efficient
in
word
and
deed
as
it
turned
out
we
were
not
to
encounter
very
many
difficulties
but
one
never
escapes
on
a
sledge
journey
in
these
regions
i
owe
my
comrades
thanks
for
the
way
in
which
they
both
did
their
best
to
smooth
our
path
johansen
and
stubberud
drove
their
i
myself
acted
as
forerunner
the
drivers
had
seven
dogs
apiece
we
took
so
many
because
we
were
not
quite
sure
of
what
the
animals
we
had
were
fit
for
as
was
right
and
proper
the
southern
party
had
picked
out
the
best
among
those
at
our
disposal
there
were
several
that
had
previously
shown
signs
of
being
rather
quickly
tired
true
this
happened
under
very
severe
conditions
as
it
turned
out
our
dogs
exceeded
all
our
expectations
in
the
easier
conditions
of
work
that
prevailed
during
the
summer
on
the
first
part
of
the
way
as
far
as
the
depot
in
the
loads
were
quite
modest
besides
the
tent
the
our
personal
outfit
and
instruments
we
only
had
provisions
for
eight
flesh
for
the
dogs
and
tinned
food
for
ourselves
our
real
supplies
were
to
be
taken
from
the
depot
where
there
was
enough
of
everything
on
november
we
left
framheim
where
in
future
lindström
was
to
reside
as
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
the
weather
was
as
fine
as
could
be
wished
i
was
out
with
the
cinematograph
apparatus
in
order
if
possible
to
immortalize
the
start
to
complete
the
series
of
pictures
lindström
was
to
take
the
forerunner
who
was
now
be
it
said
a
good
way
behind
those
he
was
supposed
to
be
leading
with
all
possible
emphasis
i
enjoined
lindström
only
to
give
the
crank
five
or
six
turns
and
then
started
off
to
catch
up
the
drivers
when
i
had
nearly
reached
the
provision
store
i
pulled
up
struck
by
a
sudden
apprehension
yes
i
was
right
on
looking
back
i
discovered
that
incorrigible
person
still
hard
at
work
with
the
crank
as
though
he
were
going
to
be
paid
a
pound
for
every
yard
of
film
showing
the
back
view
of
the
forerunner
by
making
threatening
gestures
with
a
i
stopped
the
too
persistent
cinematograph
and
then
went
on
to
join
stubberud
who
was
only
a
few
yards
ahead
johansen
had
disappeared
like
a
meteor
the
last
i
saw
of
him
was
the
soles
of
his
boots
as
he
quite
unexpectedly
made
an
elegant
backward
somersault
off
the
sledge
when
it
was
passing
over
a
little
unevenness
by
the
provision
store
the
dogs
of
course
made
off
at
full
speed
and
johansen
after
them
like
the
wind
we
all
met
again
safe
and
sound
at
the
ascent
to
the
barrier
here
a
proper
order
of
march
was
formed
and
we
proceeded
southward
the
barrier
greeted
us
with
a
fresh
south
wind
that
now
and
then
made
an
attempt
to
freeze
the
tip
of
one
nose
it
did
not
succeed
in
this
but
it
delayed
us
a
little
it
does
not
take
a
great
deal
of
wind
on
this
level
plain
to
diminish
the
rate
of
one
progress
but
the
sun
shone
too
gaily
that
day
to
allow
a
trifle
of
wind
to
interfere
very
much
with
our
enjoyment
of
life
the
surface
was
so
firm
that
there
was
hardly
a
sign
of
as
it
was
perfectly
clear
the
could
be
followed
the
whole
time
thus
assuring
us
that
at
any
rate
the
first
day
march
would
be
accomplished
without
any
deviation
from
the
right
track
at
five
we
camped
and
when
we
had
fed
the
dogs
and
come
into
the
tent
we
could
feel
how
much
easier
and
pleasanter
everything
was
at
this
season
than
on
the
former
journeys
in
autumn
and
spring
we
could
move
freely
in
a
convenient
costume
if
we
wished
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
our
performing
all
the
work
of
the
camp
with
bare
hands
and
still
preserving
our
unharmed
as
i
had
no
to
look
after
i
undertook
the
duty
of
attending
to
our
own
needs
that
is
to
say
i
acted
as
cook
this
occupation
also
was
considerably
easier
now
than
it
had
been
when
the
temperature
was
below
at
that
time
it
took
half
an
hour
to
turn
the
snow
in
the
cooker
into
water
now
it
was
done
in
ten
minutes
and
the
cook
ran
no
risk
whatever
of
getting
his
fingers
frozen
in
the
process
ever
since
we
landed
on
the
barrier
in
january
we
had
been
expecting
to
hear
a
violent
cannonade
as
the
result
of
the
movement
of
the
mass
of
ice
we
had
now
lived
a
whole
winter
at
framheim
without
having
observed
as
far
as
i
know
the
slightest
sign
of
a
sound
this
was
one
of
many
indications
that
the
ice
round
our
was
not
in
motion
at
all
no
one
i
believe
had
noticed
anything
of
the
expected
noise
on
the
sledge
journeys
either
but
at
the
place
where
we
camped
on
the
night
of
november
we
did
hear
it
there
was
a
report
about
once
in
two
minutes
not
exactly
loud
but
still
there
it
was
it
sounded
just
as
if
there
was
a
whole
battery
of
small
guns
in
action
down
in
the
depths
below
us
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
west
of
the
camp
there
were
a
number
of
small
hummocks
which
might
indicate
the
presence
of
crevasses
but
otherwise
the
surface
looked
safe
enough
the
small
guns
kept
up
a
lively
crackle
all
through
the
night
and
combined
with
a
good
deal
of
uproar
among
the
dogs
to
shorten
our
sleep
but
the
first
night
of
a
sledge
journey
is
almost
always
a
bad
one
stubberud
declared
that
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
on
account
of
that
filthy
row
he
probably
expected
the
ice
to
open
and
swallow
him
up
every
time
he
heard
it
the
surface
however
held
securely
and
we
turned
out
to
the
finest
day
one
could
wish
to
see
it
did
not
require
any
very
great
strength
of
mind
to
get
out
of
one
now
the
stockings
that
had
been
hung
up
in
the
evening
could
be
put
on
again
as
dry
as
a
bone
the
sun
had
seen
to
that
our
ski
boots
were
as
soft
as
ever
there
was
not
a
sign
of
frost
on
them
it
is
quite
curious
to
see
the
behaviour
of
the
dogs
when
the
first
head
appears
through
the
in
the
morning
they
greet
their
lord
and
master
with
the
most
unmistakable
signs
of
joy
although
of
course
they
must
know
that
his
arrival
will
be
followed
by
many
hours
of
toil
with
perhaps
a
few
doses
of
the
whip
thrown
in
but
from
the
moment
he
begins
to
handle
the
sledge
the
dogs
look
as
if
they
had
no
desire
in
the
world
but
to
get
into
the
harness
as
soon
as
possible
and
start
away
on
days
like
this
their
troubles
would
be
few
with
the
light
load
and
good
going
we
had
no
difficulty
in
covering
nineteen
geographical
miles
in
eight
hours
johansen
team
was
on
my
heels
the
whole
time
and
stubberud
animals
followed
faithfully
behind
from
time
to
time
we
saw
quite
plainly
we
also
kept
the
in
sight
all
day
in
the
temperatures
we
now
had
to
deal
with
our
costume
was
comparatively
light
certainly
much
lighter
than
most
people
imagine
for
there
is
a
kind
of
summer
even
in
antarctica
although
the
daily
readings
of
the
thermometer
at
this
season
would
perhaps
rather
remind
our
friends
at
home
of
what
they
are
accustomed
to
regard
as
winter
in
undertaking
a
sledge
journey
down
there
in
autumn
or
spring
the
most
extraordinary
precautions
have
to
be
taken
to
protect
oneself
against
the
cold
skin
clothing
is
then
the
only
thing
that
is
of
any
use
but
at
this
time
of
year
when
the
sun
is
above
the
horizon
for
the
whole
hours
one
can
go
for
a
long
time
without
being
more
heavily
clad
than
a
lumberman
working
in
the
woods
during
the
march
our
clothing
was
usually
the
following
two
sets
of
woollen
underclothes
of
which
that
nearest
the
skin
was
quite
thin
outside
the
shirt
we
wore
either
an
ordinary
waistcoat
or
a
comparatively
light
knitted
woollen
jersey
outside
all
came
our
excellent
burberry
clothes
trousers
and
jacket
when
it
was
calm
with
full
sunshine
the
burberry
jacket
was
too
warm
we
could
then
go
all
day
in
our
to
be
provided
for
emergencies
we
all
had
our
thinnest
clothes
with
us
but
so
far
as
i
know
these
were
never
used
except
as
pillows
or
mattresses
the
subject
of
has
no
doubt
been
thoroughly
threshed
out
on
every
polar
expedition
i
do
not
know
how
many
times
we
discussed
this
question
nor
can
i
remember
the
number
of
more
or
less
successful
patents
that
were
the
fruit
of
these
discussions
in
any
case
one
thing
is
certain
that
the
adherents
of
bags
were
in
an
overwhelming
majority
and
no
doubt
rightly
as
regards
bags
it
can
not
be
denied
that
they
enable
their
occupants
to
keep
warm
longer
but
it
is
always
difficult
to
find
room
for
two
big
men
in
one
sack
and
if
the
sack
is
to
be
used
for
sleeping
in
and
one
of
the
big
men
takes
to
snoring
into
the
other
ear
the
situation
may
become
quite
unendurable
in
the
temperatures
we
had
on
the
summer
journeys
there
was
no
difficulty
in
keeping
warm
enough
with
the
bags
and
they
were
used
by
all
of
us
on
the
first
southern
journey
in
september
johansen
and
i
used
a
double
bag
between
us
in
the
intense
cold
that
prevailed
at
that
time
we
managed
to
get
through
the
night
without
freezing
but
if
the
weather
is
so
cold
that
one
can
not
keep
warmth
in
one
body
in
good
roomy
bags
then
it
is
altogether
unfit
for
sledging
journeys
november
immediately
after
the
start
this
morning
we
tried
how
we
could
get
on
without
a
forerunner
as
long
as
we
were
in
the
line
of
flags
this
answered
very
well
the
dogs
galloped
from
one
flag
to
another
while
i
was
able
to
adopt
the
easy
method
of
hanging
on
to
stubberud
sledge
about
midday
we
were
abreast
of
the
depression
already
mentioned
where
on
the
third
depot
journey
last
autumn
we
ran
into
a
regular
net
of
crevasses
this
time
we
were
aware
of
the
danger
and
kept
to
the
left
but
at
the
last
moment
the
leading
team
ran
out
to
the
wrong
side
and
we
cut
across
the
eastern
part
of
the
dangerous
zone
fortunately
it
was
taken
at
full
gallop
it
is
quite
possible
that
i
inwardly
wished
we
were
all
a
few
pounds
lighter
as
our
little
caravan
raced
across
those
thin
snow
bridges
through
which
could
be
seen
the
blue
colour
of
the
ugly
gulfs
below
but
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
long
minutes
we
could
congratulate
ourselves
on
getting
over
with
our
full
numbers
not
for
anything
would
i
have
gone
that
mile
without
ski
on
my
feet
it
would
practically
have
meant
falling
in
and
going
out
it
is
perhaps
saying
a
good
deal
to
claim
that
with
ski
on
one
is
absolutely
secured
against
the
danger
these
crevasses
present
if
misfortunes
are
abroad
anything
may
happen
but
it
would
require
a
very
considerable
amount
of
bad
luck
for
man
and
ski
to
fall
through
november
in
weather
like
this
going
on
the
march
is
like
going
to
a
dance
tent
and
clothes
keep
soft
and
dry
as
a
bone
the
thermometer
is
about
a
suddenly
put
down
in
our
midst
from
civilized
surroundings
would
possibly
shake
his
head
at
so
many
degrees
of
frost
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
we
have
long
ago
abandoned
the
ordinary
ideas
of
civilized
people
as
to
what
is
endurable
in
the
way
of
temperature
we
are
enthusiastic
about
the
weather
especially
when
we
remember
what
it
was
like
down
here
two
months
ago
when
the
thermometer
showed
and
the
rime
hung
an
inch
thick
inside
the
tent
ready
to
drop
on
everything
and
everybody
at
the
slightest
movement
now
there
is
no
rime
to
be
seen
the
sun
clears
it
away
for
now
there
is
a
sun
not
the
feeble
imitation
of
one
that
stuck
its
red
face
above
the
northern
horizon
in
august
but
our
good
old
acquaintance
of
lower
latitudes
with
his
wealth
of
light
and
warmth
after
two
hours
march
we
came
in
sight
at
ten
in
the
morning
of
the
two
that
were
built
on
the
last
trip
we
made
straight
for
them
thinking
we
might
possibly
find
some
trace
of
the
southern
party
so
we
did
though
in
a
very
different
way
from
what
we
expected
we
were
perhaps
about
a
mile
off
when
we
all
three
suddenly
halted
and
stared
at
the
huts
there
are
men
said
stubberud
at
any
rate
there
was
something
black
that
moved
and
after
confused
thoughts
of
japanese
englishmen
and
the
like
had
flashed
through
our
minds
we
at
last
got
out
the
glasses
it
was
not
men
but
a
dog
well
the
presence
of
a
live
dog
here
miles
up
the
barrier
was
in
itself
a
remarkable
thing
it
must
of
course
be
one
of
the
southern
party
dogs
but
how
the
runaway
had
kept
himself
alive
all
that
time
was
for
the
present
a
mystery
on
coming
to
closer
quarters
we
soon
found
that
it
was
one
of
dogs
peary
by
name
he
was
a
little
shy
to
begin
with
but
when
he
heard
his
name
he
quickly
understood
that
we
were
friends
come
on
a
visit
and
no
longer
hesitated
to
approach
us
he
was
fat
and
round
and
evidently
pleased
to
see
us
again
the
hermit
had
lived
on
the
lamentable
remains
of
poor
sara
whom
we
had
been
obliged
to
kill
here
in
september
sara
lean
and
frozen
body
did
not
seem
particularly
adapted
for
making
anyone
fat
and
yet
our
friend
peary
looked
as
if
he
had
been
feasting
for
weeks
possibly
he
had
begun
by
devouring
neptune
another
of
his
companions
who
had
also
given
the
southern
party
the
slip
on
the
way
to
the
depot
in
however
this
may
be
peary
rest
cure
came
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
stubberud
took
him
and
put
him
in
his
team
we
had
thought
of
reaching
the
depot
before
the
close
of
the
day
and
this
we
could
easily
have
done
if
the
good
going
had
continued
but
during
the
afternoon
the
surface
became
so
loose
that
the
dogs
sank
in
up
to
their
chests
and
when
at
about
six
in
the
evening
the
showed
geographical
miles
the
animals
were
so
done
up
that
it
was
no
use
going
on
at
eleven
the
next
morning
sunday
november
we
reached
the
depot
captain
amundsen
had
promised
to
leave
a
brief
report
when
the
southern
party
left
here
and
the
first
thing
we
did
on
arrival
was
of
course
to
search
for
the
document
in
the
place
agreed
upon
there
were
not
many
words
on
the
little
slip
of
paper
but
they
gave
us
the
welcome
intelligence
all
well
so
far
we
had
expected
that
the
southern
party
dogs
would
have
finished
the
greater
part
if
not
the
whole
of
the
seal
meat
that
was
laid
down
here
in
april
but
fortunately
this
was
not
the
case
there
was
a
great
quantity
left
so
that
we
could
give
our
own
dogs
a
hearty
feed
with
easy
consciences
they
had
it
too
and
it
was
no
trifling
amount
that
they
got
through
the
four
days
trot
from
framheim
had
been
enough
to
produce
an
unusual
appetite
there
was
a
puppy
in
johansen
team
that
was
exposed
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
the
fatigues
of
a
sledge
journey
this
was
a
plucky
little
chap
that
went
by
the
name
of
lillegut
the
sudden
change
from
short
commons
to
abundance
was
too
much
for
his
small
stomach
and
the
poor
puppy
lay
shrieking
in
the
snow
most
of
the
afternoon
we
also
looked
after
ourselves
that
day
and
had
a
good
meal
of
fresh
seal
meat
after
that
we
supplied
ourselves
from
the
large
stores
that
lay
here
with
the
necessary
provisions
for
a
sledge
journey
of
five
weeks
three
cases
of
dogs
pemmican
one
case
of
men
pemmican
containing
ninety
rations
pounds
of
dried
milk
pounds
of
oatmeal
biscuits
and
three
tins
of
malted
milk
besides
instruments
alpine
rope
and
clothing
the
necessary
quantity
of
chocolate
had
been
brought
with
us
from
framheim
as
there
was
none
of
this
to
spare
out
in
the
field
our
stock
of
paraffin
was
gallons
divided
between
two
tanks
one
on
each
sledge
our
cooking
outfit
was
exactly
the
same
as
that
used
by
the
southern
party
the
instruments
we
carried
were
a
theodolite
a
hypsometer
two
aneroids
one
of
which
was
no
larger
than
an

thermometers
one
chronometer
watch
one
ordinary
watch
and
one
photographic
camera
kodak
x
inches
adapted
for
using
either
plates
or
films
we
had
three
spools
of
film
and
one
dozen
plates
our
medical
outfit
was
exceedingly
simple
it
consisted
of
nothing
but
a
box
of
laxative
pills
three
small
rolls
of
gauze
bandage
and
a
small
pair
of
scissors
which
also
did
duty
for
both
pills
and
gauze
were
untouched
when
we
returned
it
may
therefore
be
safely
said
that
our
state
of
health
during
the
journey
was
excellent
while
the
drivers
were
packing
and
lashing
their
loads
which
now
weighed
nearly
pounds
i
wrote
a
report
to
the
chief
and
took
an
azimuth
observation
to
determine
the
direction
of
our
course
according
to
our
instructions
we
should
really
have
taken
a
course
from
here
but
as
our
dogs
seemed
to
be
capable
of
more
and
better
work
than
we
had
expected
and
as
there
was
believed
to
be
a
possibility
that
bare
land
was
to
be
found
due
east
of
the
spot
where
we
were
it
was
decided
to
make
an
attempt
in
that
direction
our
old
enemy
the
fog
had
made
its
appearance
in
the
course
of
the
night
and
now
hung
grey
and
disgusting
under
the
sky
when
we
broke
camp
at
the
depot
on
the
morning
of
november
however
it
was
not
so
bad
as
to
prevent
our
following
the
flags
that
marked
the
depot
on
the
east
my
duty
as
forerunner
was
immediately
found
to
be
considerably
lighter
than
before
with
the
greatly
increased
weight
behind
them
the
dogs
had
all
they
could
do
to
follow
if
i
went
at
an
ordinary
walking
pace
at
we
passed
the
easternmost
flag
at
five
geographical
miles
from
the
depot
and
then
we
found
ourselves
on
untrodden
ground
a
light
southerly
breeze
appeared
very
opportunely
and
swept
away
the
fog
the
sun
again
shed
its
light
over
the
barrier
which
lay
before
us
shining
and
level
as
we
had
been
accustomed
to
see
it
there
was
however
one
difference
with
every
mile
we
covered
there
was
the
possibility
of
seeing
something
new
the
going
was
excellent
although
the
surface
was
rather
looser
than
one
could
have
wished
the
ski
flew
over
it
finely
of
course
while
dogs
feet
and
sank
in
i
hope
i
shall
never
have
to
go
here
without
ski
that
would
be
a
terrible
punishment
but
with
ski
on
one
feet
and
in
such
weather
it
was
pure
enjoyment
meanwhile
the
new
sights
we
expected
were
slow
in
coming
we
marched
for
four
days
due
east
without
seeing
a
sign
of
change
in
the
ground
there
was
the
same
undulating
surface
that
we
knew
so
well
from
previous
expeditions
the
readings
of
the
hypsometer
gave
practically
the
same
result
day
after
day
the
ascent
we
were
looking
for
failed
to
appear
stubberud
who
for
the
first
day
or
two
after
leaving
the
depot
had
been
constantly
stretching
himself
on
tiptoe
and
looking
out
for
finally
gave
it
as
his
heartfelt
conviction
that
this
king
edward
land
we
were
hunting
for
was
only
a
confounded
flyaway
land
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
reality
we
others
were
not
yet
quite
prepared
to
share
this
view
for
my
own
part
in
any
case
i
was
loth
to
give
up
the
theory
that
assumed
a
southward
continuation
of
king
edward
land
along
the
meridian
this
theory
had
acquired
a
certain
force
during
the
winter
and
was
mainly
supported
by
the
fact
that
on
the
second
depot
journey
we
had
seen
between
the
and
parallels
some
big
which
suggested
the
presence
of
bare
land
in
a
direction
on
november
we
found
ourselves
at
the
meridian
but
on
every
side
the
eye
encountered
the
level
uninterrupted
snow
surface
and
nothing
else
should
we
go
on
it
was
tempting
enough
as
the
probability
was
that
sooner
or
later
we
should
come
upon
something
but
there
was
a
point
in
our
instructions
that
had
to
be
followed
and
it
said
go
to
the
point
where
land
is
marked
on
the
chart
this
point
was
now
about
geographical
miles
to
the
north
of
us
therefore
instead
of
going
on
to
the
east
in
uncertainty
we
decided
to
turn
to
the
left
and
go
north
the
position
of
the
spot
where
we
altered
our
course
was
determined
and
it
was
marked
by
a
snow
beacon
feet
high
on
the
top
of
which
was
placed
a
tin
box
containing
a
brief
report
on
that
part
of
the
way
which
we
now
had
before
us
there
was
little
prospect
of
meeting
with
surprises
nor
did
any
fall
to
our
lot
in
day
marches
that
varied
from
seventeen
to
twenty
geographical
miles
we
went
forward
over
practically
level
ground
the
nature
of
the
surface
was
at
first
ideal
but
as
we
came
farther
north
and
thus
nearer
to
the
sea
our
progress
was
impeded
by
a
great
number
of
big
sastrugi
which
had
probably
been
formed
during
the
long
period
of
bad
weather
that
preceded
our
departure
from
framheim
we
did
not
escape
damage
on
this
bad
surface
stubberud
broke
the
forward
part
of
the
spare
ski
he
had
lashed
under
his
sledge
and
sledge
also
suffered
from
the
continual
bumping
against
the
hard
sastrugi
luckily
he
had
been
foreseeing
enough
to
bring
a
little
hickory
bar
which
came
in
very
handy
as
a
splint
for
the
broken
part
as
we
were
now
following
the
direction
of
the
meridian
or
in
other
words
as
our
course
was
now
true
north
the
daily
observations
of
latitude
gave
a
direct
check
on
the
readings
of
the
as
a
rule
they
agreed
to
the
nearest
minute
whilst
i
was
taking
the
noon
altitude
my
companions
had
the
choice
of
standing
by
the
side
of
their
sledges
and
eating
their
lunch
or
setting
the
tent
and
taking
shelter
they
generally
chose
the
latter
alternative
making
up
for
it
by
going
an
hour
longer
in
the
afternoon
besides
the
astronomical
observations
the
barometric
pressure
temperature
force
and
direction
of
the
wind
and
amount
of
cloud
were
noted
three
times
daily
every
evening
a
hypsometer
reading
was
taken
if
i
were
to
undertake
the
description
of
a
long
series
of
days
like
those
that
passed
while
we
were
travelling
on
the
flat
barrier
i
am
afraid
the
narrative
would
be
strikingly
reminiscent
of
the
celebrated
song
of
a
hundred
and
twenty
verses
all
with
the
same
rhyme
one
day
was
very
much
like
another
one
would
think
that
this
monotony
would
make
the
time
long
but
the
direct
opposite
was
the
case
i
have
never
known
time
fly
so
rapidly
as
on
these
sledge
journeys
and
seldom
have
i
seen
men
more
happy
and
contented
with
their
existence
than
we
three
when
after
a
successful
day
march
we
could
set
about
taking
our
simple
meal
with
a
pipe
of
cut
plug
to
follow
the
bill
of
fare
was
identically
the
same
every
day
perhaps
a
fault
in
the
eyes
of
many
variety
of
diet
is
supposed
to
be
the
thing
hang
variety
say
i
appetite
is
what
matters
to
a
man
who
is
really
hungry
it
is
a
very
subordinate
matter
what
he
shall
eat
the
main
thing
is
to
have
something
to
satisfy
his
hunger
after
going
north
for
seven
days
we
found
that
according
to
observations
and
we
ought
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sea
this
was
correct
my
diary
for
november
reads
we
were
to
see
something
besides
sky
and
snow
an
hour
after
breaking
camp
this
morning
two
snowy
petrels
came
sailing
over
us
a
little
while
later
a
couple
of
skua
gulls
we
welcomed
them
as
the
first
living
creatures
we
had
seen
since
leaving
the
constantly
increasing
to
the
north
had
long
ago
warned
us
that
we
were
approaching
the
sea
the
presence
of
the
birds
told
us
it
was
not
far
off
the
skua
gulls
settled
very
near
us
and
the
dogs
no
doubt
taking
them
for
baby
seals
were
of
course
ready
to
break
the
line
of
march
and
go
off
hunting
but
their
keenness
soon
passed
when
they
discovered
that
the
game
had
wings
the
edge
of
the
barrier
was
difficult
to
see
and
profiting
by
previous
experience
of
how
easy
it
is
to
go
down
when
the
light
is
bad
we
felt
our
way
forward
step
by
step
at
four
we
thought
we
could
see
the
precipice
a
halt
was
made
at
a
safe
distance
and
i
went
in
advance
to
look
over
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
there
was
open
water
right
in
to
the
wall
of
ice
we
had
expected
the
to
extend
a
good
way
out
still
seeing
it
was
so
early
in
summer
but
there
lay
the
sea
almost
free
of
ice
as
far
as
the
horizon
black
and
threatening
it
was
to
look
at
but
still
a
beneficent
contrast
to
the
everlasting
snow
surface
on
which
we
had
now
tramped
for
geographical
miles
the
perpendicular
drop
of
feet
that
forms
the
boundary
between
the
dead
barrier
and
the
sea
with
its
varied
swarm
of
life
is
truly
an
abrupt
and
imposing
transition
the
panorama
from
the
top
of
the
is
always
grand
and
it
can
be
beautiful
as
well
on
a
sunny
day
or
still
more
on
a
moonlit
night
it
has
a
fairylike
beauty
a
heavy
black
sky
hung
above
a
still
blacker
sea
and
the
which
shines
in
the
light
with
a
dazzling
white
purity
looked
more
like
an
old
wall
than
anything
else
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
sound
of
the
surf
at
the
bottom
of
the
precipice
now
and
then
reached
my
ears
this
was
the
only
thing
that
broke
the
vast
silence
one
own
dear
self
becomes
so
miserably
small
in
these
mighty
surroundings
it
was
a
sheer
relief
to
get
back
to
the
company
of
my
comrades
as
things
now
were
with
open
water
up
to
the
barrier
itself
our
prospect
of
getting
seals
here
at
the
edge
of
the
ice
seemed
a
poor
one
next
morning
however
we
found
a
few
miles
farther
east
a
bay
about
four
miles
long
and
almost
entirely
enclosed
it
was
still
frozen
over
and
seals
were
lying
on
the
ice
by
the
dozen
here
was
food
enough
to
give
both
ourselves
and
the
dogs
an
extra
feed
and
to
replenish
our
supplies
we
camped
and
went
off
to
examine
the
ground
more
closely
there
were
plenty
of
crevasses
but
a
practicable
descent
was
found
and
in
a
very
short
time
three
seals
and
a
fat
young
one
were
despatched
we
hauled
half
a
carcass
up
to
the
camp
with
the
alpine
rope
as
we
were
hard
at
work
dragging
our
spoil
up
the
steep
slope
we
heard
stubberud
sing
out
below
there
and
away
he
went
like
a
stone
in
a
well
he
had
gone
through
the
on
which
we
were
standing
but
a
lucky
projection
stopped
our
friend
from
going
very
far
down
besides
which
he
had
taken
a
firm
round
turn
with
the
rope
round
his
wrist
it
was
therefore
a
comparatively
easy
matter
to
get
him
up
on
the
surface
again
this
little
intermezzo
would
probably
have
been
avoided
if
we
had
not
been
without
our
ski
but
the
slope
was
so
steep
and
smooth
that
we
could
not
use
them
after
a
few
more
hauls
we
had
the
seal
up
by
the
tent
where
a
large
quantity
of
it
disappeared
in
a
surprisingly
short
time
down
the
throats
of
fifteen
hungry
dogs
the
ice
of
the
bay
was
furrowed
by
numerous
leads
and
while
the
hunters
were
busy
cutting
up
the
seals
i
tried
to
get
a
sounding
but
the
thirty
fathoms
of
alpine
rope
i
had
were
not
enough
no
bottom
was
reached
after
having
something
to
eat
we
went
down
again
in
order
if
possible
to
find
out
the
depth
this
time
we
were
better
supplied
with
sounding
tackle
two
reels
of
thread
a
marlinspike
and
our
geological
hammer
first
the
marlinspike
was
sent
down
with
the
thread
as
a
line
an
inquisitive
lout
of
a
seal
did
all
it
could
to
bite
through
the
thread
but
whether
this
was
too
strong
or
its
teeth
too
poor
we
managed
after
a
lot
of
trouble
to
coax
the
marlinspike
up
again
and
the
interfering
rascal
who
had
to
come
up
to
the
surface
now
and
then
to
take
breath
got
the
spike
of
a
in
his
thick
hide
this
unexpected
treatment
was
evidently
not
at
all
to
his
liking
and
after
acknowledging
it
by
a
roar
of
disgust
he
vanished
into
the
depths
now
we
got
on
better
the
marlinspike
sank
and
sank
until
it
had
drawn
with
it
fathoms
of
thread
a
very
small
piece
of
seaweed
clung
to
the
thread
as
we
hauled
it
in
again
on
the
spike
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
as
its
weight
was
rather
light
for
so
great
a
depth
a
possible
setting
of
current
might
have
carried
it
a
little
to
one
side
we
decided
to
try
once
more
with
the
hammer
which
was
considerably
heavier
in
order
to
check
the
result
the
hammer
on
the
other
hand
was
so
heavy
that
with
the
delicate
thread
as
a
line
the
probability
of
successfully
carrying
out
the
experiment
seemed
small
but
we
had
to
risk
it
the
improvised
sinker
was
well
smeared
with
blubber
and
this
time
it
sank
so
rapidly
to
the
bottom
as
to
leave
no
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
the
sounding
fathoms
again
by
using
extreme
care
we
succeeded
in
getting
the
hammer
up
again
in
safety
but
no
specimen
of
the
bottom
was
clinging
to
it
on
the
way
back
to
camp
we
dragged
with
us
the
carcass
of
the
young
seal
it
was
past
three
when
we
got
into
our
that
night
and
in
consequence
we
slept
a
good
deal
later
than
usual
the
next
morning
the
forenoon
was
spent
by
johansen
and
stubberud
in
hauling
up
another
seal
from
the
bay
and
packing
as
much
flesh
on
the
sledges
as
possible
as
fresh
meat
is
a
commodity
that
takes
up
a
great
deal
of
space
in
proportion
to
its
weight
the
quantity
we
were
able
to
take
with
us
was
not
large
the
chief
advantage
we
had
gained
was
that
a
considerable
supply
could
be
stored
on
the
spot
and
it
might
be
useful
to
fall
back
upon
in
case
of
delay
or
other
mishaps
i
took
the
observation
for
longitude
and
latitude
found
the
height
by
hypsometer
and
took
some
photographs
after
laying
down
the
depot
and
erecting
beacons
we
broke
camp
at
south
of
the
head
of
the
bay
there
were
a
number
of
elevations
and
pressure
masses
exactly
like
the
formations
to
be
found
about
framheim
to
the
east
a
prominent
ridge
appeared
and
with
the
glass
it
could
be
seen
to
extend
inland
in
a
direction
according
to
our
observations
this
must
be
the
same
that
captain
scott
has
marked
with
on
his
chart
we
made
a
wide
detour
outside
the
worst
and
then
set
our
course
towards
the
ridge
just
mentioned
it
was
a
pretty
steep
rise
which
was
not
at
all
a
good
thing
for
the
dogs
they
had
overeaten
themselves
shockingly
and
most
of
the
seal
flesh
came
up
again
so
that
their
feast
should
not
be
altogether
wasted
we
stopped
as
soon
as
we
had
come
far
enough
up
the
ridge
to
be
able
to
regard
the
surface
as
comparatively
safe
for
in
the
depression
round
the
bay
it
was
somewhat
doubtful
on
the
following
morning
sunday
november
there
was
a
gale
from
the
with
sky
and
barrier
lost
in
driving
snow
that
put
an
end
to
our
plans
of
a
long
sunday
march
in
the
midst
of
our
disappointment
i
had
a
sudden
bright
idea
it
was
queen
birthday
if
we
could
not
go
on
we
could
at
least
celebrate
the
day
in
a
modest
fashion
in
one
of
the
provision
cases
there
was
still
a
solitary
stavanger
tin
containing
salt
beef
and
peas
it
was
opened
at
once
and
its
contents
provided
a
banquet
that
tasted
better
to
us
than
the
most
carefully
chosen
menu
had
ever
done
in
this
connection
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
the
joy
it
would
bring
to
many
a
household
in
this
world
if
its
master
were
possessed
of
an
appetite
like
ours
the
wife
would
then
have
no
need
to
dread
the
consequences
however
serious
the
shortcomings
of
the
cuisine
might
be
but
to
return
to
the
feast
her
majesty
health
was
drunk
in
a
very
small
but
at
the
same
time
very
good
tot
of
aquavit
served
in
enamelled
iron
mugs
carrying
alcohol
was
of
course
against
regulations
strictly
speaking
but
as
everyone
knows
prohibition
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
put
into
practice
even
in
antarctica
this
proved
to
be
the
case
lindström
had
a
habit
of
sending
a
little
surprise
packet
with
each
sledging
party
that
went
out
and
on
our
departure
he
had
handed
us
one
of
these
with
the
injunction
that
the
packet
was
only
to
be
opened
on
some
festive
occasion
we
chose
as
such
her
birthday
on
examination
the
packet
was
found
to
contain
a
little
flask
of
spirits
in
which
we
at
once
agreed
to
drink
the
queen
health
the
brought
the
same
nasty
weather
and
the
was
not
much
better
though
not
bad
enough
to
stop
us
after
a
deal
of
hard
work
in
hauling
our
buried
belongings
out
of
the
snow
we
got
away
and
continued
our
course
to
the
it
was
not
exactly
an
agreeable
morning
a
brisk
wind
with
driving
snow
right
in
face
after
trudging
against
this
for
a
couple
of
hours
i
heard
stubberud
call
halt
half
his
team
were
hanging
by
the
traces
in
a
crevasse
i
had
gone
across
without
noticing
anything
no
doubt
owing
to
the
snow
in
my
face
one
would
think
the
dogs
would
be
suspicious
of
a
place
like
this
but
they
are
not
they
plunge
on
till
the
breaks
under
them
luckily
the
harness
held
so
that
it
was
the
affair
of
a
moment
to
pull
the
poor
beasts
up
again
even
a
dog
might
well
be
expected
to
be
a
trifle
shaken
after
hanging
head
downwards
over
such
a
fearful
chasm
but
apparently
they
took
it
very
calmly
and
were
quite
prepared
to
do
the
same
thing
over
again
for
my
own
part
i
looked
out
more
carefully
after
this
and
although
there
were
a
good
many
ugly
fissures
on
the
remaining
part
of
the
ascent
we
crossed
them
all
without
further
incident
unpleasant
as
these
crevasses
are
they
do
not
involve
any
direct
danger
so
long
as
the
weather
is
clear
and
the
light
favourable
one
can
then
judge
by
the
appearance
of
the
surface
whether
there
is
danger
ahead
and
if
crevasses
are
seen
in
time
there
is
always
a
suitable
crossing
to
be
found
the
case
is
somewhat
different
in
fog
drift
or
when
the
light
is
such
that
the
small
inequalities
marking
the
course
of
the
crevasse
do
not
show
up
this
last
is
often
the
case
in
cloudy
weather
when
even
a
fairly
prominent
rise
will
not
be
noticed
on
the
absolutely
white
surface
until
one
falls
over
it
in
such
conditions
it
is
safest
to
feel
one
way
forward
with
the
though
this
mode
of
proceeding
is
more
troublesome
than
effective
in
the
course
of
the
the
ascent
came
to
an
end
and
with
it
the
crevasses
the
wind
fell
quite
light
and
the
blinding
drift
was
succeeded
by
clear
sunshine
we
had
now
come
sufficiently
high
up
to
have
a
view
of
the
sea
far
to
the
during
the
high
wind
a
quantity
of
ice
had
been
driven
southward
so
that
for
a
great
distance
there
was
no
open
water
to
be
seen
but
a
number
of
huge
icebergs
from
the
distance
of
the
sea
horizon
we
guessed
our
height
to
be
about
feet
and
in
the
evening
the
hypsometer
showed
the
guess
to
be
very
nearly
right
november
weather
and
going
all
that
could
be
wished
on
breaking
camp
this
morning
before
us
we
had
a
level
plateau
which
appeared
to
be
quite
free
from
unpleasant
obstructions
when
we
halted
for
the
noon
observation
the
showed
ten
geographical
miles
and
before
evening
we
had
brought
the
day
distance
up
to
twenty
the
latitude
was
then
the
distance
to
the
barrier
edge
on
the
north
was
at
a
guess
about
twenty
geographical
miles
we
were
now
a
good
way
along
the
peninsula
the
northern
point
of
which
captain
scott
named
cape
colbeck
and
at
the
same
time
a
good
way
to
the
east
of
the
meridian
in
which
he
put
on
his
chart
our
height
above
the
sea
which
was
now
about
feet
was
evidence
enough
that
we
had
firm
land
under
us
but
it
was
still
sheathed
in
ice
in
that
respect
the
landscape
offered
no
change
from
what
we
had
learnt
to
know
by
the
name
of
barrier
it
can
not
be
denied
that
at
this
juncture
i
began
to
entertain
a
certain
doubt
of
the
existence
of
bare
land
in
this
quarter
this
doubt
was
not
diminished
when
we
had
done
another
good
march
to
the
eastward
on
november
according
to
our
observations
we
were
then
just
below
the
point
where
the
alexandra
mountains
should
begin
but
there
was
no
sign
of
mountain
ranges
the
surface
was
a
little
rougher
perhaps
however
it
was
still
too
soon
to
abandon
the
hope
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
expect
any
great
degree
of
accuracy
of
the
chart
we
had
to
go
by
its
scale
was
far
too
large
for
that
it
was
moreover
more
than
probable
that
our
own
determination
of
longitude
was
open
to
doubt
assuming
the
approximate
accuracy
of
the
chart
by
holding
on
to
the
we
ought
soon
to
come
down
to
the
seaboard
and
with
this
object
in
view
we
continued
our
march
on
december
in
the
middle
of
the
day
we
saw
that
everything
agreed
from
the
top
of
an
eminence
the
sea
was
visible
due
north
and
on
the
east
two
domed
summits
were
outlined
apparently
high
enough
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
of
mountains
they
were
covered
with
snow
but
on
the
north
side
of
them
there
was
an
abrupt
precipice
in
which
many
black
patches
showed
up
sharply
against
the
white
background
it
was
still
too
soon
to
form
an
idea
as
to
whether
they
were
bare
rock
or
not
they
might
possibly
be
fissures
in
the
mass
of
ice
the
appearance
of
the
summits
agreed
exactly
with
captain
scott
description
of
what
he
saw
from
the
deck
of
the
discovery
in
he
assumed
that
the
black
patches
were
rocks
emerging
from
the
as
will
be
seen
later
our
respected
precursor
was
right
in
order
to
examine
the
nature
of
the
seaboard
we
began
by
steering
down
towards
it
but
in
the
meantime
the
weather
underwent
an
unfavourable
change
the
sky
clouded
over
and
the
light
became
as
vile
as
it
could
be
the
point
we
were
anxious
to
clear
up
was
whether
there
was
any
barrier
wall
here
or
whether
the
land
and
gradually
passed
into
each
other
in
an
easy
slope
as
the
light
was
there
might
well
have
been
a
drop
of
feet
without
our
seeing
anything
of
it
securely
roped
together
we
made
our
way
down
until
our
progress
was
stopped
by
a
huge
which
as
far
as
could
be
made
out
formed
the
boundary
between
land
and
it
was
however
impossible
in
the
circumstances
to
get
any
clear
view
of
the
surroundings
and
after
trudging
back
to
the
sledges
which
had
been
left
up
on
the
slope
we
turned
to
the
east
to
make
a
closer
examination
of
the
summits
already
mentioned
i
went
in
front
as
usual
in
the
cheerful
belief
that
we
had
a
fairly
level
stretch
before
us
but
i
was
far
out
in
my
calculation
my
ski
began
to
slip
along
at
a
terrific
speed
and
it
was
advisable
to
put
on
the
brake
this
was
easily
done
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
but
with
the
dogs
it
was
a
different
matter
nothing
could
stop
them
when
they
felt
that
the
sledge
was
running
by
its
own
weight
they
went
in
a
wild
gallop
down
the
slope
the
end
of
which
could
not
at
present
be
seen
i
suppose
it
will
sound
like
a
tall
story
but
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
that
to
our
eyes
the
surface
appeared
to
be
horizontal
all
the
time
snow
horizon
and
sky
all
ran
together
in
a
white
chaos
in
which
all
lines
of
demarcation
were
obliterated
fortunately
nothing
came
of
our
expectation
that
the
scamper
would
have
a
frightful
ending
in
some
insidious
abyss
it
was
stopped
quite
naturally
by
an
opposing
slope
which
appeared
to
be
as
steep
as
the
one
we
had
just
slid
down
if
the
pace
had
been
rather
too
rapid
before
there
was
now
no
ground
of
complaint
on
that
score
step
by
step
we
crawled
up
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
but
the
ground
was
carefully
surveyed
before
we
proceeded
farther
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
we
groped
our
way
forward
over
a
whole
series
of
ridges
and
intervening
depressions
although
nothing
could
be
seen
it
was
obvious
enough
that
our
surroundings
were
now
of
an
entirely
different
character
from
anything
we
had
previously
been
accustomed
to
the
two
mountain
summits
had
disappeared
in
the
fleecy
mist
but
the
increasing
unevenness
of
the
ground
showed
that
we
were
approaching
them
meanwhile
i
considered
it
inadvisable
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
them
so
long
as
we
were
unable
to
use
our
eyes
and
remembering
what
happens
when
the
blind
leads
the
blind
we
camped
for
the
first
time
during
the
trip
i
had
a
touch
of
that
afternoon
this
troublesome
and
rightly
dreaded
complaint
was
a
thing
that
we
had
hitherto
succeeded
in
keeping
off
by
a
judicious
use
of
our
excellent
among
my
duties
as
forerunner
was
that
of
maintaining
the
direction
and
this
at
times
involved
a
very
severe
strain
on
the
eyes
in
thick
weather
it
is
only
too
easy
to
yield
to
the
temptation
of
throwing
off
the
protective
goggles
with
the
idea
that
one
can
see
better
without
them
although
i
knew
perfectly
well
what
the
consequence
would
be
i
had
that
afternoon
broken
the
commandment
of
prudence
the
trifling
smart
i
felt
in
my
eyes
was
cured
by
keeping
the
goggles
on
for
a
couple
of
hours
after
we
were
in
the
tent
like
all
other
ills
may
easily
be
dispelled
by
taking
it
in
time
next
morning
the
sun
disc
could
just
be
made
out
through
a
veil
of
thin
stratus
clouds
and
then
the
light
was
more
or
less
normal
again
as
soon
as
we
could
see
what
our
surroundings
were
it
was
clear
enough
that
we
had
done
right
in
stopping
the
game
of
blind
man
buff
we
had
been
playing
on
the
previous
day
it
might
otherwise
have
had
an
unpleasant
ending
right
across
our
line
of
route
and
about
yards
from
our
camp
the
surface
was
so
broken
up
that
it
was
more
like
a
sieve
than
anything
else
in
the
background
the
masses
of
snow
were
piled
in
huge
drifts
down
a
steep
slope
on
the
side
of
the
two
mountains
it
was
impossible
to
take
the
sledges
any
farther
on
the
way
we
had
hitherto
been
following
but
in
the
course
of
the
day
we
worked
round
by
a
long
detour
to
the
foot
of
the
most
westerly
of
the
mountains
we
were
then
about
feet
above
the
sea
to
the
north
of
us
we
had
the
abrupt
descent
already
mentioned
to
the
south
it
was
quite
flat
our
view
to
the
east
was
shut
in
by
the
two
mountains
and
our
first
idea
was
to
ascend
to
the
tops
of
them
but
the
powers
of
the
weather
again
opposed
us
with
their
full
force
a
stiff
wind
set
in
and
increased
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
to
a
regular
blizzard
little
as
it
suited
our
wishes
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
creep
back
into
the
tent
for
a
whole
month
now
we
had
seen
scarcely
anything
but
fair
weather
and
the
advance
of
summer
had
given
us
hopes
that
it
would
hold
but
just
when
it
suited
us
least
of
all
came
a
dismal
change
the
light
antarctic
summer
night
ran
its
course
while
the
gusts
of
wind
tugged
and
tore
at
the
thin
sides
of
our
tent
no
snowfall
accompanied
the
wind
but
the
loose
snow
of
the
surface
was
whirled
up
into
a
drift
that
stood
like
an
impenetrable
wall
round
the
tent
after
midnight
it
moderated
a
little
and
by
four
there
was
comparatively
fair
weather
we
were
on
our
feet
at
once
put
together
camera
glasses
aneroids
axe
alpine
rope
with
some
lumps
of
pemmican
to
eat
on
the
way
and
then
went
off
for
a
morning
walk
with
the
nearer
of
the
two
hills
as
our
goal
all
three
of
us
went
leaving
the
dogs
in
charge
of
the
camp
they
were
not
so
fresh
now
that
they
would
not
gladly
accept
all
the
rest
that
was
offered
them
we
had
no
need
to
fear
any
invasion
of
strangers
the
land
we
had
come
to
appeared
to
be
absolutely
devoid
of
living
creatures
of
any
kind
the
hill
was
farther
off
and
higher
than
it
appeared
at
first
the
aneroid
showed
a
rise
of
feet
when
we
reached
the
top
as
our
camp
lay
at
a
height
of
feet
this
gave
us
feet
as
the
height
of
this
hill
above
the
sea
the
side
we
went
up
was
covered
by
névé
which
to
judge
from
the
depth
of
the
cracks
must
have
been
immense
as
we
approached
the
summit
and
our
view
over
the
surrounding
ground
became
wider
the
belief
that
we
should
see
so
much
as
a
crag
of
this
king
edward
land
grew
weaker
and
weaker
there
was
nothing
but
white
on
every
side
not
a
single
consolatory
little
black
patch
however
carefully
we
looked
and
to
think
that
we
had
been
dreaming
of
great
mountain
masses
in
the
style
of
mcmurdo
sound
with
sunny
slopes
penguins
by
the
thousand
seals
and
all
the
rest
all
these
visions
were
slowly
but
surely
sunk
in
an
endless
sea
of
snow
and
when
at
last
we
stood
on
the
highest
point
we
certainly
thought
there
could
be
no
chance
of
a
revival
of
our
hopes
but
the
unexpected
happened
after
all
on
the
precipitous
northern
side
of
the
adjacent
hill
our
eyes
fell
upon
bare
rock
the
first
glimpse
we
had
had
of
positive
land
during
the
year
we
had
been
in
antarctica
our
next
thought
was
of
how
to
get
to
it
and
take
specimens
and
with
this
object
we
at
once
began
to
scale
the
neighbouring
hill
which
was
a
trifle
higher
than
the
one
we
had
first
ascended
the
precipice
was
however
perpendicular
with
a
huge
snow
cornice
it
lowering
a
man
on
the
rope
would
be
rather
too
hazardous
a
proceeding
besides
which
a
length
of
thirty
yards
would
not
go
very
far
if
we
were
to
get
at
the
rock
it
would
have
to
be
from
below
in
the
meantime
we
availed
ourselves
of
the
opportunity
offered
by
the
clear
weather
to
make
a
closer
examination
of
our
surroundings
from
the
isolated
summit
feet
high
on
which
we
stood
the
view
was
fairly
extensive
down
to
the
sea
on
the
north
the
distance
was
about
five
geographical
miles
the
surface
descended
in
terraces
towards
the
edge
of
the
water
where
there
was
quite
a
low
barrier
wall
as
might
be
expected
this
stretch
of
the
was
broken
by
innumerable
crevasses
rendering
any
passage
across
it
impossible
on
the
east
extended
a
about
twenty
geographical
miles
in
length
and
somewhat
lower
than
the
summit
on
which
we
stood
this
was
the
alexandra
mountains
it
could
not
be
called
an
imposing
range
and
it
was
from
one
end
to
the
other
only
on
the
most
easterly
spur
was
the
rock
just
visible
on
the
south
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
usual
undulating
barrier
surface

has
named
it
was
for
the
moment
a
for
numerous
icebergs
one
or
two
of
these
seemed
to
be
aground
the
inmost
corner
of
the
bay
was
covered
with
on
its
eastern
side
the
barrier
edge
could
be
seen
to
continue
northward
as
marked
in
captain
scott
chart
but
no
indication
of
bare
land
was
visible
in
that
quarter
having
built
a
snow
beacon
feet
high
on
the
summit
we
put
on
our
ski
again
and
went
down
the
eastern
slope
of
the
hill
at
a
whizzing
pace
on
this
side
there
was
an
approach
to
the
level
on
the
north
of
the
precipice
and
we
availed
ourselves
of
it
seen
from
below
the
mountain
crest
looked
quite
grand
with
a
perpendicular
drop
of
about
feet
the
cliff
was
covered
with
ice
up
to
a
height
of
about
feet
and
this
circumstance
threatened
to
be
a
serious
obstacle
to
our
obtaining
specimens
of
the
rocks
but
in
one
place
a
nunatak
about
feet
high
stood
out
in
front
of
the
precipice
and
the
ascent
of
this
offered
no
great
difficulty
a
wall
of
rock
of
very
ordinary
appearance
is
not
usually
reckoned
among
things
capable
of
attracting
the
attention
of
the
human
eye
to
any
marked
extent
nevertheless
we
three
stood
and
gazed
at
it
as
though
we
had
something
of
extraordinary
beauty
and
interest
before
us
the
explanation
is
very
simple
if
we
remember
the
old
saying
about
the
charm
of
variety
a
sailor
who
for
months
has
seen
nothing
but
sea
and
sky
will
lose
himself
in
contemplation
of
a
little
islet
be
it
never
so
barren
and
desolate
to
us
who
for
nearly
a
year
had
been
staring
our
eyes
out
in
a
dazzling
white
infinity
of
snow
and
ice
it
was
indeed
an
experience
to
see
once
more
a
bit
of
the
earth
crust
that
this
fragment
was
as
poor
and
bare
as
it
could
be
was
not
taken
into
consideration
at
the
moment
the
mere
sight
of
the
naked
rock
was
however
only
an
anticipatory
pleasure
a
more
substantial
one
was
the
feeling
of
again
being
able
to
move
on
ground
that
afforded
a
sure
and
trustworthy
foothold
it
is
possible
that
we
behaved
rather
like
children
on
first
reaching
bare
land
one
of
us
in
any
case
found
immense
enjoyment
in
rolling
one
big
block
after
another
down
the
steep
slopes
of
the
nunatak
at
any
rate
the
sport
had
the
interest
of
novelty
this
little
peak
was
built
up
of
very
heterogenous
materials
as
the
practical
result
of
our
visit
we
brought
away
a
fairly
abundant
collection
of
specimens
of
all
the
rocks
to
be
found
there
not
being
a
specialist
i
can
not
undertake
any
classification
of
the
specimens
it
will
be
the
task
of
geologists
to
deal
with
them
and
to
obtain
if
possible
some
information
as
to
the
structure
of
the
country
i
will
only
mention
that
some
of
the
stones
were
so
heavy
that
they
must
certainly
have
contained
metallic
ore
of
one
kind
or
another
on
returning
to
camp
that
evening
we
tried
them
with
the
and
it
showed
very
marked
attraction
in
the
case
of
one
or
two
of
the
specimens
these
must
therefore
contain
this
spur
which
had
been
severely
handled
by
and
the
ravages
of
time
offered
a
poor
chance
of
finding
what
we
coveted
most
namely
fossils
and
the
most
diligent
search
proved
unsuccessful
in
this
respect
from
finds
that
have
been
made
in
other
parts
of
antarctica
it
is
known
that
in
former
geological
periods
the
jurassic
epoch
even
this
desolate
continent
possessed
a
rich
and
luxurious
vegetation
the
leader
of
the
swedish
expedition
to
graham
land
nordenskjöld
and
his
companion
gunnar
andersson
were
the
first
to
make
this
exceedingly
interesting
and
important
discovery
while
it
did
not
fall
to
our
lot
to
furnish
any
proof
of
the
existence
of
an
earlier
flora
in
king
edward
land
we
found
living
plants
of
the
most
primitive
form
even
on
that
tiny
islet
in
the
ocean
of
snow
the
rock
was
in
many
places
covered
with
thick
moss
how
did
that
moss
come
there
its
occurrence
might
perhaps
be
quoted
in
support
of
the
hypothesis
of
the
genesis
of
organic
life
from
dead
matter
this
disputed
question
must
here
be
left
open
but
it
may
be
mentioned
in
the
same
connection
that
we
found
the
remains
of
nests
in
many
places
among
the
rocks
possibly
the
occupants
of
these
nests
may
have
been
instrumental
in
the
conveyance
of
the
moss
otherwise
the
signs
of
bird
life
were
very
few
one
or
two
solitary
snowy
petrels
circled
round
the
summit
while
we
were
there
that
was
all
it
was
highly
important
to
obtain
some
successful
photographs
from
this
spot
and
i
was
setting
about
the
necessary
preparations
when
one
of
my
companions
made
a
remark
about
the
changed
appearance
of
the
sky
busy
with
other
things
i
had
entirely
neglected
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
weather
an
omission
for
which
as
will
be
seen
we
might
have
had
to
pay
dearly
fortunately
another
had
been
more
watchful
than
i
and
the
warning
came
in
time
a
glance
was
enough
to
convince
me
of
the
imminent
approach
of
a
the
fiery
red
sky
and
the
heavy
ring
round
the
sun
spoke
a
language
that
was
only
too
clear
we
had
a
good
hour
march
to
the
tent
and
the
possibility
of
being
surprised
by
the
storm
before
we
arrived
was
practically
equivalent
to
never
arriving
at
all
we
very
soon
put
our
things
together
and
came
down
the
nunatak
even
more
quickly
on
the
steep
slopes
leading
up
to
the
plateau
on
which
the
tent
stood
the
pace
was
a
good
deal
slower
though
we
made
every
possible
effort
to
hurry
there
was
no
need
to
trouble
about
the
course
we
had
only
to
follow
the
trail
of
our
own
ski
so
long
as
it
was
visible
but
the
drift
was
beginning
to
blot
it
out
and
if
it
once
did
that
any
attempt
at
finding
the
tent
would
be
hopeless
for
a
long
and
anxious
quarter
of
an
hour
it
looked
as
if
we
should
be
too
late
until
at
last
the
tent
came
in
sight
and
we
were
saved
we
had
escaped
the
blizzard
so
far
a
few
minutes
later
it
burst
in
all
its
fury
and
the
whirling
snow
was
so
thick
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
see
the
tent
at
a
distance
of
ten
paces
but
by
then
we
were
all
safe
and
sound
inside
ravenously
hungry
after
the
twelve
hours
that
had
passed
since
our
last
proper
meal
we
cooked
an
extra
large
portion
of
pemmican
and
the
same
of
chocolate
and
with
this
sumptuous
repast
we
celebrated
the
event
of
the
day
the
discovery
of
land
from
what
we
had
seen
in
the
course
of
the
day
it
might
be
regarded
as
certain
that
we
should
be
disappointed
in
our
hopes
of
finding
any
great
and
interesting
field
for
our
labours
in
this
quarter
king
edward
land
was
still
far
too
well
hidden
under
eternal
snow
and
ice
to
give
us
that
but
even
the
establishment
of
this
to
us
somewhat
unwelcome
fact
marked
an
increase
of
positive
human
knowledge
of
the
territory
that
bears
the
name
of
king
edward
vii
and
with
the
geological
specimens
that
we
had
collected
we
were
in
possession
of
a
tangible
proof
of
the
actual
existence
of
solid
ground
in
a
region
which
otherwise
bore
the
greatest
resemblance
to
what
we
called
barrier
elsewhere
or
in
any
case
to
the
barrier
as
it
appears
in
the
neighbourhood
of
our
at
framheim
monday
december
the
gale
kept
on
at
full
force
all
night
and
increased
rather
than
moderated
as
the
day
advanced
as
usual
the
storm
was
accompanied
by
a
very
marked
rise
of
temperature
at
the
noon
observation
the
reading
was
this
is
the
highest
temperature
we
have
had
so
far
on
this
trip
and
a
good
deal
higher
than
we
care
about
when
the
mercury
comes
so
near
as
this
the
floor
of
the
tent
is
always
damp
for
once
in
a
way
we
have
falling
snow
and
enough
of
it
it
is
snowing
incessantly
big
hard
flakes
almost
like
hail
when
the
cooker
was
filled
to
provide
water
for
dinner
the
mass
looked
like
sago
the
heavy
flakes
of
snow
make
a
noise
against
the
tent
that
reminds
one
of
the
of
a
large
boiler
blowing
off
inside
the
tent
it
is
difficult
to
hear
oneself
speak
when
we
have
anything
to
say
to
each
other
we
have
to
shout
these
days
of
involuntary
idleness
on
a
sledge
journey
may
safely
be
reckoned
among
the
experiences
it
is
difficult
to
go
through
without
a
good
deal
of
mental
suffering
i
say
nothing
of
the
purely
physical
discomfort
of
having
to
pass
the
day
in
a
that
may
be
endured
in
any
case
so
long
as
the
bag
is
fairly
dry
it
is
a
far
worse
matter
to
reconcile
oneself
to
the
loss
of
the
many
solid
hours
that
might
otherwise
have
been
put
to
a
useful
purpose
and
to
the
irritating
consciousness
that
every
bit
of
food
that
is
consumed
is
so
much
wasted
of
the
limited
store
at
this
spot
of
all
others
we
should
have
been
so
glad
to
spend
the
time
in
exploring
round
about
or
still
more
in
going
farther
but
if
we
are
to
go
on
we
must
be
certain
of
having
a
chance
of
getting
seals
at
a
reasonable
distance
from
here
with
our
remaining
supply
of
dogs
food
we
can
not
go
on
for
more
than
three
days
what
we
have
left
will
be
just
enough
for
the
return
journey
even
if
we
should
not
find
the
depot
of
seals
flesh
left
on
the
way
there
remained
the
resource
of
killing
dogs
if
it
was
a
question
of
getting
as
far
to
the
east
as
possible
but
for
many
reasons
i
shrank
from
availing
myself
of
that
expedient
we
could
form
no
idea
of
what
would
happen
to
the
southern
party
animals
the
probability
was
that
they
would
have
none
left
on
their
return
supposing
their
return
were
delayed
so
long
as
to
involve
spending
another
winter
on
the
barrier
the
transport
of
supplies
from
the
ship
could
hardly
be
carried
out
in
the
necessary
time
with
the
ten
untrained
puppies
that
were
left
with
lindström
we
had
picked
out
the
useful
ones
and
i
thought
that
should
the
necessity
arise
they
could
be
used
with
greater
advantage
for
this
work
than
we
should
derive
from
slaughtering
them
here
and
thereby
somewhat
prolonging
the
distance
covered
the
more
so
as
to
judge
from
all
appearance
there
was
a
poor
prospect
of
our
finding
anything
of
interest
within
a
reasonable
time
tuesday
december
it
looks
as
if
our
patience
is
to
be
given
a
really
hard
trial
this
time
outside
the
same
state
of
things
continues
and
the
barometer
is
going
down
a
mass
of
snow
has
fallen
in
the
last
hours
the
drift
on
the
windward
side
of
the
tent
is
constantly
growing
if
it
keeps
on
a
little
longer
it
will
be
as
high
as
the
top
of
the
tent
the
sledges
are
completely
snowed
under
and
so
are
the
dogs
we
had
to
haul
them
out
one
by
one
in
the
middle
of
the
day
most
of
them
are
now
loose
as
there
is
nothing
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
their
teeth
it
is
now
blowing
a
regular
gale
the
direction
of
the
wind
is
about
true
east
occasionally
squalls
of
violence
occur
fortunately
the
big
keeps
us
comfortable
and
we
are
under
the
lee
of
a
hill
otherwise
it
would
look
badly
for
our
tent
hitherto
it
has
held
well
but
it
is
beginning
to
be
rather
damp
inside
the
temperature
remains
very
high
at
noon
and
the
mass
of
snow
pressing
against
the
tent
causes
the
formation
of
rime
in
order
to
while
away
the
time
to
some
extent
under
depressing
circumstances
like
these
i
put
into
my
diary
on
leaving
framheim
a
few
loose
leaves
of
a
russian
grammar
johansen
solaced
himself
with
a
serial
cut
out
of
the
aftenpost
as
far
as
i
remember
the
title
of
it
was
the
red
rose
and
the
white
unfortunately
the
story
of
the
two
roses
was
very
soon
finished
but
johansen
had
a
good
remedy
for
that
he
simply
began
it
over
again
my
reading
had
the
advantage
of
being
incomparably
stiffer
russian
verbs
are
uncommonly
difficult
of
digestion
and
not
to
be
swallowed
in
a
hurry
for
lack
of
mental
nutriment
stubberud
with
great
resignation
consoled
himself
with
a
pipe
but
his
enjoyment
must
have
been
somewhat
diminished
by
the
thought
that
his
stock
of
tobacco
was
shrinking
at
an
alarming
rate
every
time
he
filled
his
pipe
i
could
see
him
cast
longing
looks
in
the
direction
of
my
pouch
which
was
still
comparatively
full
i
could
not
help
promising
a
fraternal
sharing
in
case
he
should
run
short
and
after
that
our
friend
puffed
on
with
an
easy
mind
although
i
look
at
it
at
least
every
the
barometer
will
not
go
up
at
it
was
down
to
if
this
means
anything
it
can
only
be
that
we
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
being
imprisoned
here
another
day
some
poor
consolation
is
to
be
had
in
the
thought
of
how
lucky
we
were
to
reach
the
tent
at
the
last
moment
the
day
before
yesterday
a
storm
as
lasting
as
this
one
would
in
all
probability
have
been
too
much
for
us
if
we
had
not
got
in
wednesday
december
the
third
day
of
idleness
has
at
last
crept
away
after
its
predecessors
we
have
done
with
it
it
has
not
brought
any
marked
variation
the
weather
has
been
just
as
violent
until
now
the
wind
shows
a
slight
tendency
to
moderate
it
is
surely
time
it
did
three
days
and
nights
should
be
enough
for
it
the
heavy
snowfall
continues
big
wet
flakes
come
dancing
down
through
the
opening
in
the
drift
in
which
the
peak
of
the
tent
still
manages
to
show
itself
in
the
course
of
three
days
we
have
had
more
snowfall
here
than
we
had
at
framheim
in
ten
whole
months
it
will
be
interesting
to
compare
our
meteorological
log
with
lindström
probably
he
has
had
his
share
of
the
storm
and
in
that
case
it
will
have
given
him
some
exercise
in
the
moisture
is
beginning
to
be
rather
troublesome
now
most
of
our
wardrobe
is
wet
through
and
the
will
soon
meet
with
the
same
fate
the
outside
is
now
so
high
that
it
shuts
out
most
of
the
daylight
we
are
in
twilight
we
shall
be
obliged
to
dig
out
the
tent
whatever
the
weather
is
like
otherwise
we
shall
be
buried
entirely
and
run
the
additional
risk
of
having
the
tent
split
by
the
weight
of
snow
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
a
work
to
dig
out
the
tent
and
the
two
sledges
we
have
only
one
little
shovel
to
do
it
with
a
slight
rise
of
both
barometer
and
thermometer
tells
us
that
at
last
we
are
on
the
eve
of
the
change
we
have
been
longing
for
stubberud
is
certain
of
fair
weather
he
says
i
am
by
no
means
so
sure
and
offer
to
bet
pretty
heavily
that
there
will
be
no
change
two
inches
of
norwegian
plug
tobacco
is
the
stake
and
with
a
heartfelt
desire
that
jörgen
may
win
i
await
the
morrow
thursday
december
early
this
morning
i
owned
to
having
lost
my
bet
as
the
weather
so
far
as
i
could
tell
was
no
longer
of
the
same
tempestuous
character
but
stubberud
thought
the
contrary
it
seems
to
me
just
as
bad
said
he
he
was
right
enough
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
this
did
not
prevent
my
persuading
him
to
accept
payment
meanwhile
we
were
obliged
to
make
an
attempt
to
dig
out
the
tent
regardless
of
the
weather
the
situation
was
no
longer
endurable
we
waited
all
the
forenoon
in
the
hope
of
an
improvement
but
as
none
came
we
set
to
work
at
twelve
our
implements
showed
some
originality
and
diversity
a
little
spade
a
and
a
cooker
the
drift
did
its
best
to
undo
our
work
as
fast
as
we
dug
but
we
managed
to
hold
our
own
against
it
digging
out
the
gave
most
trouble
after
six
hours
hard
work
we
got
the
tent
set
up
a
few
yards
to
windward
of
its
first
position
the
place
where
it
had
stood
was
now
a
well
about
seven
feet
deep
unfortunately
there
was
no
chance
of
immortalizing
this
scene
of
excavation
it
would
have
been
amusing
enough
to
have
it
on
the
plate
but
drifting
snow
is
a
serious
obstacle
to
an
amateur
photographer
besides
which
my
camera
was
on
stubberud
sledge
buried
at
least
four
feet
down
in
the
course
of
our
digging
we
had
had
the
misfortune
to
make
two
or
three
serious
rents
in
the
thin
canvas
of
the
tent
and
the
drift
was
not
long
in
finding
a
way
through
these
when
the
tent
was
up
again
to
conclude
my
day
work
i
had
therefore
a
longish
tailor
job
while
the
other
two
men
were
digging
out
a
good
feed
for
the
dogs
who
had
been
on
for
the
last
two
days
that
night
we
went
rather
short
of
sleep
vulcan
the
oldest
dog
in
johansen
team
was
chiefly
to
blame
for
this
in
his
old
age
vulcan
was
afflicted
with
a
bad
digestion
for
even
eskimo
dogs
may
be
liable
to
this
infirmity
hardy
as
they
generally
are
the
protracted
blizzard
had
given
the
old
fellow
a
relapse
and
he
proclaimed
this
distressing
fact
by
incessant
howling
this
kind
of
music
was
not
calculated
to
lull
us
to
sleep
and
it
was
three
or
four
in
the
morning
before
we
could
snatch
a
nap
during
a
pause
i
was
just
dropping
off
when
the
sun
showed
faintly
through
the
tent
this
unwonted
sight
at
once
banished
all
further
thoughts
of
sleep
the
primus
was
lighted
a
cup
of
chocolate
swallowed
and
out
we
went
stubberud
and
johansen
set
to
work
at
the
hard
task
of
digging
out
the
sledges
they
had
to
go
down
four
feet
to
get
hold
of
them
i
dragged
our
wet
clothes
and
so
forth
out
of
the
tent
and
hung
them
all
up
to
dry
in
the
course
of
the
morning
observations
were
taken
for
determining
the
geographical
longitude
and
latitude
as
well
as
a
few
photographs
which
will
give
some
idea
of
what
our
camp
looked
like
after
the
blizzard
having
made
good
the
damage
and
put
everything
fairly
in
order
we
hurried
away
to
our
peaks
to
secure
some
photographs
while
the
light
was
favourable
this
time
we
were
able
to
achieve
our
object
scott
nunataks
as
they
were
afterwards
named
after
captain
scott
who
first
saw
them
were
now
for
the
first
time
recorded
by
the
camera
before
we
left
the
summit
the
norwegian
flag
was
planted
there
a
snow
beacon
erected
and
a
report
of
our
visit
deposited
in
it
the
weather
would
not
keep
clear
before
we
were
back
at
the
camp
there
was
a
thick
fog
and
once
more
we
had
to
thank
the
tracks
of
our
ski
for
showing
us
the
way
during
the
time
we
had
been
involuntarily
detained
at
this
spot
our
store
of
provisions
had
decreased
alarmingly
there
was
only
a
bare
week
supply
left
and
in
less
than
a
week
we
should
hardly
be
able
to
make
home
probably
it
would
take
more
than
a
week
but
in
that
case
we
had
the
depot
at
our
bay
of
seals
to
fall
back
upon
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
our
present
position
we
could
not
reckon
on
being
able
to
replenish
our
supply
in
the
continued
unfavourable
state
of
the
weather
we
therefore
made
up
our
minds
on
the
morning
of
december
to
break
off
the
journey
and
turn
our
faces
homeward
for
three
days
more
we
had
to
struggle
with
high
wind
and
thick
snow
but
as
things
now
were
we
had
no
choice
but
to
keep
going
and
by
the
evening
of
the
we
had
dragged
ourselves
fifty
geographical
miles
to
the
west
the
weather
cleared
during
the
night
and
at
last
on
december
we
had
a
day
of
real
sunshine
all
our
discomforts
were
forgotten
everything
went
easily
again
in
the
course
of
nine
hours
we
covered
geographical
miles
that
day
without
any
great
strain
on
either
dogs
or
men
at
our
midday
rest
we
found
ourselves
abreast
of
the
bay
where
on
the
outward
journey
we
had
laid
down
our
depot
of
seals
flesh
i
had
intended
to
turn
aside
to
the
depot
and
replenish
our
supply
of
meat
as
a
precaution
but
johansen
suggested
leaving
out
this
detour
and
going
straight
on
we
might
thereby
run
the
risk
of
having
to
go
on
short
rations
but
johansen
thought
it
a
greater
risk
to
cross
the
treacherous
ground
about
the
bay
and
after
some
deliberation
i
saw
he
was
right
it
was
better
to
go
on
while
we
were
about
it
from
this
time
on
we
met
with
no
difficulty
and
rapidly
drew
near
to
our
destination
in
regular
daily
marches
of
twenty
geographical
miles
after
men
and
dogs
had
received
their
daily
ration
on
the
evening
of
the
our
sledge
cases
were
practically
empty
but
according
to
our
last
position
we
should
not
have
more
than
twenty
geographical
miles
more
to
framheim
saturday
december
we
broke
camp
at
the
usual
time
in
overcast
but
perfectly
clear
weather
and
began
what
was
to
be
our
last
march
on
this
trip
a
dark
hung
over
the
barrier
on
the
west
and
showing
that
there
was
open
sea
off
the
mouth
of
the
bay
of
whales
we
went
on
till
our
course
being
true
west
when
we
made
out
far
to
the
an
that
was
taken
to
be
the
extreme
point
on
the
western
side
of
the
bay
immediately
after
we
were
on
the
edge
of
the
barrier
the
direction
of
which
was
here
and
we
altered
our
course
and
followed
the
edge
at
a
proper
distance
until
we
saw
a
familiar
iceberg
that
had
broken
off
to
the
north
of
framheim
but
had
been
stopped
by
the
from
drifting
out
with
this
excellent
mark
in
view
the
rest
of
the
way
was
plain
sailing
the
showed
geographical
miles
when
in
the
afternoon
we
came
in
sight
of
our
winter
home
quiet
and
peaceful
it
lay
there
if
possible
more
deeply
covered
in
snow
than
when
we
had
left
it
at
first
we
could
see
no
sign
of
life
but
soon
the
glasses
discovered
a
lonely
wanderer
on
his
way
from
the
house
to
the
meteorological
institute
so
lindström
was
still
alive
and
performing
his
duties
when
we
left
our
friend
had
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
getting
us
out
of
the
way
but
i
have
a
suspicion
that
he
was
quite
as
pleased
to
see
us
back
again
i
am
not
quite
certain
though
that
he
did
see
us
for
the
moment
as
he
was
about
as
as
a
man
can
be
lindström
was
the
last
person
we
should
have
suspected
of
that
malady
on
our
asking
him
how
it
came
about
he
seemed
at
first
unwilling
to
give
any
explanation
but
by
degrees
it
came
out
that
the
misfortune
had
happened
a
couple
of
days
before
when
he
had
gone
out
after
seals
his
team
composed
of
nothing
but
puppies
had
run
away
and
pulled
up
at
a
big
hummock
out
by
the
western
cape
ten
miles
from
the
station
but
lindström
who
is
a
determined
man
would
not
give
up
before
he
had
caught
the
runaways
and
this
was
too
much
for
his
eyes
as
he
had
no
goggles
with
him
when
i
got
home
i
could
see
what
the
time
was
he
said
but
it
must
have
been
somewhere
about
six
in
the
morning
when
we
had
made
him
put
on
plenty
of
red
and
supplied
him
with
a
proper
pair
of
goggles
he
was
soon
cured
framheim
had
had
the
same
protracted
storms
with
heavy
snowfall
on
several
mornings
the
master
of
the
house
had
had
to
dig
his
way
out
through
the
outside
the
door
but
during
the
last
three
fine
days
he
had
managed
to
clear
a
passage
not
only
to
the
door
but
to
the
window
as
well
daylight
came
down
into
the
room
through
a
well
nine
feet
deep
this
had
been
a
tremendous
piece
of
work
but
as
already
hinted
nothing
can
stop
lindström
when
he
makes
up
his
mind
his
stock
of
seals
flesh
was
down
to
a
minimum
the
little
there
was
vanished
on
the
appearance
of
our
ravenous
dogs
we
ourselves
were
in
no
such
straits
sweets
were
the
only
things
in
special
demand
we
stayed
at
home
one
day
after
bringing
up
two
loads
of
flesh
filling
our
empty
provision
cases
carrying
out
a
number
of
small
repairs
and
checking
our
watches
we
were
again
on
the
road
on
monday
the
we
were
not
very
loth
to
leave
the
house
indoor
existence
had
become
rather
uncomfortable
on
account
of
constant
dripping
from
the
ceiling
in
the
course
of
the
winter
a
quantity
of
ice
had
formed
in
the
loft
as
the
kitchen
fire
was
always
going
after
our
return
the
temperature
became
high
enough
to
melt
the
ice
and
the
water
streamed
down
lindström
was
annoyed
and
undertook
to
put
a
stop
to
it
he
disappeared
into
the
loft
and
sent
down
a
hail
of
ice
broken
cases
and
other
treasures
through
the
we
fled
before
the
storm
and
drove
away
this
time
we
had
to
carry
out
our
instructions
as
to
the
exploration
of
the
long
eastern
arm
of
the
bay
of
whales
during
the
autumn
several
sunday
excursions
had
been
made
along
this
remarkable
formation
but
although
some
of
these
had
extended
as
far
as
twelve
miles
in
one
direction
there
was
no
sign
of
the
hummocks
coming
to
an
end
these
great
disturbances
of
the
must
have
a
cause
and
the
only
conceivable
one
was
that
the
subjacent
land
had
brought
about
this
disruption
of
the
surface
for
immediately
to
the
south
there
was
undoubtedly
land
as
there
the
surface
rose
somewhat
rapidly
to
a
height
of
feet
but
it
was
covered
with
snow
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
rock
might
project
among
the
evidences
of
heavy
pressure
at
the
foot
of
this
slope
and
with
this
possibility
in
view
we
made
a
five
days
trip
following
the
great
fissure
or
bay
as
we
generally
called
it
right
up
to
its
head
geographical
miles
to
the
east
of
our
although
we
came
across
no
bare
rock
and
in
that
respect
the
journey
was
a
disappointment
it
was
nevertheless
very
interesting
to
observe
the
effects
of
the
mighty
forces
that
had
here
been
at
work
the
disruption
of
the
solid
by
the
still
more
solid
rock
the
day
before
christmas
eve
we
were
back
at
framheim
lindström
had
made
good
use
of
his
time
in
our
absence
the
ice
had
disappeared
from
the
loft
and
therewith
the
rain
from
the
ceiling
new
linoleum
had
been
laid
down
over
half
the
floor
and
marks
of
the
were
visible
on
the
ceiling
these
efforts
had
possibly
been
made
with
an
eye
to
the
approaching
festival
but
in
other
respects
we
abstained
from
any
attempt
at
keeping
christmas
it
did
not
agree
with
the
time
of
year
constant
blazing
sunshine
all
through
the
hours
could
not
be
reconciled
with
a
northerner
idea
of
christmas
and
for
that
reason
we
had
kept
the
festival
six
months
before
christmas
eve
fell
on
a
sunday
and
it
passed
just
like
any
ordinary
sunday
perhaps
the
only
difference
was
that
we
used
a
razor
that
day
instead
of
the
usual
on
christmas
day
we
took
a
holiday
and
lindström
prepared
a
banquet
of
skua
gulls
despise
this
dish
as
one
may
it
tasted
undeniably
of
bird
the
numerous
were
now
in
a
sad
way
under
the
weight
of
the
constantly
increasing
mass
the
roofs
of
most
of
the
rooms
were
pressed
so
far
in
that
there
was
just
enough
space
to
crawl
on
hands
and
knees
in
the
crystal
palace
and
the
clothing
store
we
kept
all
our
skin
clothing
besides
a
good
deal
of
outfit
which
it
was
intended
to
take
on
board
the
fram
when
she
and
the
southern
party
arrived
if
the
sinking
continued
it
would
be
a
long
business
digging
these
things
out
again
and
in
order
to
have
everything
ready
we
made
up
our
minds
to
devote
a
few
days
to
this
work
at
once
we
hauled
the
snow
up
from
these
two
rooms
through
a
well
twelve
feet
deep
by
means
of
tackles
it
was
a
long
job
but
when
we
had
finished
this
part
of
the
labyrinth
was
as
good
as
ever
we
had
no
time
to
deal
with
the
or
the
carpenter
shop
just
then
there
still
remained
the
survey
of
the
corner
of
the
bay
of
whales
and
its
surroundings
on
an
eight
days
sledge
journey
starting
at
the
new
year
we
ranged
about
this
district
where
we
were
surprised
to
find
the
solid
barrier
divided
into
small
islands
separated
by
comparatively
broad
sounds
these
isolated
masses
of
ice
could
not
possibly
be
afloat
although
the
depth
in
one
or
two
places
where
we
had
a
chance
of
making
soundings
proved
to
be
as
much
as
fathoms
the
only
rational
explanation
we
could
think
of
was
that
there
must
be
a
group
of
islands
here
or
in
any
case
shoals
these
ice
islands
if
one
may
call
them
so
had
a
height
of
feet
and
sloped
evenly
down
to
the
water
on
the
greater
part
of
their
circumference
one
of
the
sounds
that
penetrated
into
the
barrier
a
short
distance
inside
the
western
cape
of
the
bay
continued
southward
and
gradually
narrowed
to
a
mere
fissure
we
followed
this
until
it
lost
itself
thirty
geographical
miles
within
the
barrier
the
last
day
of
this
trip
thursday
january
will
always
be
fixed
in
our
memory
it
was
destined
to
bring
us
experiences
of
the
kind
that
are
never
forgotten
our
start
in
the
morning
was
made
at
exactly
the
same
time
and
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
so
many
times
before
we
felt
pretty
certain
of
reaching
framheim
in
the
course
of
the
day
but
that
prospect
was
for
the
moment
of
minor
importance
in
the
existing
state
of
the
weather
our
tent
offered
us
as
comfortable
quarters
as
our
winter
home
what
made
us
look
forward
to
our
return
with
some
excitement
was
the
possibility
of
seeing
the
fram
again
and
this
thought
was
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
all
of
us
that
january
morning
though
we
did
not
say
much
about
it
after
two
hours
march
we
caught
sight
of
west
cape
at
the
entrance
to
the
bay
in
our
line
of
route
and
a
little
later
we
saw
a
black
strip
of
sea
far
out
on
the
horizon
as
usual
a
number
of
bergs
of
all
sizes
were
floating
on
this
strip
in
every
variety
of
shade
from
white
to
dark
grey
as
the
light
fell
on
them
one
particular
lump
appeared
to
us
so
dark
that
it
could
hardly
be
made
of
ice
but
we
had
been
taken
in
too
many
times
to
make
any
remark
about
it
as
the
dogs
now
had
a
mark
to
go
by
johansen
was
driving
in
front
without
my
help
i
went
by
the
side
of
stubberud
sledge
the
man
at
my
side
kept
staring
out
to
sea
without
uttering
a
word
on
my
asking
him
what
in
the
world
he
was
looking
at
he
replied
i
could
almost
swear
it
was
a
ship
but
of
course
it
only
a
wretched
iceberg
we
were
just
agreed
upon
this
when
suddenly
johansen
stopped
short
and
began
a
hurried
search
for
his
long
glass
are
you
going
to
look
at
the
fram
i
asked
ironically
yes
i
am
he
said
and
while
he
turned
the
telescope
upon
the
doubtful
object
far
out
in
ross
sea
we
two
stood
waiting
for
a
few
endless
seconds
it
the
fram
sure
enough
as
large
as
life
was
the
welcome
announcement
that
broke
our
suspense
i
glanced
at
stubberud
and
saw
his
face
expanding
into
its
most
amiable
smile
though
i
had
not
much
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
johansen
statement
i
borrowed
his
glass
and
a
fraction
of
a
second
was
enough
to
convince
me
that
ship
was
easily
recognized
she
was
our
own
old
fram
safely
back
again
we
had
still
fourteen
long
miles
to
framheim
and
an
obstinate
wind
right
in
our
faces
but
that
part
of
the
way
was
covered
in
a
remarkably
short
time
on
arriving
at
home
at
two
in
the
afternoon
we
had
some
expectation
of
finding
a
crowd
of
people
in
front
of
the
house
but
there
was
not
a
living
soul
to
be
seen
even
lindström
remained
concealed
though
as
a
rule
he
was
always
about
when
anyone
arrived
thinking
that
perhaps
our
friend
had
had
a
relapse
of
i
went
in
to
announce
our
return
lindström
was
standing
before
his
range
in
the
best
of
health
when
i
entered
the
kitchen
the
fram
come
he
shouted
before
i
had
shut
the
door
tell
me
something
i
do
know
said
i
and
be
so
kind
as
to
give
me
a
cup
of
water
with
a
little
syrup
in
it
if
you
can
i
thought
somehow
that
the
cook
had
a
sly
grin
on
his
face
when
he
brought
what
i
asked
for
but
with
the
thirst
i
had
after
the
stiff
march
i
gave
a
great
part
of
my
attention
to
the
drink
i
had
consumed
the
best
part
of
a
quart
when
lindström
went
off
to
his
bunk
and
asked
if
i
could
guess
what
he
had
hidden
there
there
was
no
time
to
guess
anything
before
the
blankets
were
thrown
on
to
the
floor
and
after
them
bounded
a
bearded
ruffian
clad
in
a
jersey
and
a
pair
of
overalls
of
indeterminable
age
and
colour
hullo
said
the
ruffian
and
the
voice
was
that
of
lieutenant
gjertsen
lindström
was
shaking
with
laughter
while
i
stood
before
this
apparition
i
had
been
given
a
good
surprise
we
agreed
to
treat
johansen
and
stubberud
in
the
same
way
and
as
soon
as
they
were
heard
outside
gjertsen
hid
himself
again
among
the
blankets
but
stubberud
had
smelt
a
rat
in
some
way
or
other
there
are
more
than
two
in
this
room
he
said
as
soon
as
he
came
in
it
was
no
surprise
to
him
to
find
a
man
from
the
fram
in
lindström
bunk
when
we
heard
that
the
visitor
had
been
under
our
roof
for
a
whole
day
we
assumed
that
in
the
course
of
that
time
he
had
heard
all
about
our
own
concerns
from
lindström
we
were
therefore
not
inclined
to
talk
about
ourselves
we
wanted
news
from
without
and
gjertsen
was
more
than
ready
to
give
us
them
the
fram
had
arrived
two
days
before
all
well
after
lying
at
the
ice
edge
for
a
day
and
a
night
keeping
a
constant
lookout
for
the
natives
gjertsen
had
grown
so
curious
to
know
how
things
were
at
framheim
that
he
had
asked
captain
nilsen
for
shore
leave
the
careful
skipper
had
hesitated
a
while
before
giving
permission
it
was
a
long
way
up
to
the
house
and
the
was
scored
with
lanes
some
of
them
fairly
wide
finally
gjertsen
had
his
way
and
he
left
the
ship
taking
a
signal
flag
with
him
he
found
it
rather
difficult
to
recognize
his
surroundings
to
begin
with
one
ice
cape
was
very
like
another
and
ugly
ideas
of
calvings
suggested
themselves
until
at
last
he
caught
sight
of
cape
man
head
and
then
he
knew
that
the
foundations
of
framheim
had
not
given
way
cheered
by
this
knowledge
he
made
his
way
towards
mount
nelson
but
on
arriving
at
the
top
of
this
ridge
from
which
there
was
a
view
over
framheim
the
eager
explorer
felt
his
heart
sink
where
our
new
house
had
made
such
a
brave
show
a
year
before
on
the
surface
of
the
barrier
there
was
now
no
house
at
all
to
be
seen
all
that
met
the
eyes
of
the
visitor
was
a
sombre
pile
of
ruins
but
his
anxiety
quickly
vanished
when
a
man
emerged
from
the
confusion
the
man
was
lindström
and
the
supposed
ruin
was
the
most
ingenious
of
all
lindström
was
ignorant
of
the
fram
arrival
and
the
face
he
showed
on
seeing
gjertsen
must
have
been
worth
some
money
to
look
at
when
our
first
curiosity
was
satisfied
our
thoughts
turned
to
our
comrades
on
board
the
fram
we
snatched
some
food
and
then
went
down
to
the
making
our
way
across
the
little
bay
due
north
of
the
house
our
team
were
not
long
in
getting
there
but
we
had
some
trouble
with
them
in
crossing
the
cracks
in
the
ice
as
some
of
the
dogs
especially
the
puppies
had
a
terror
of
water
the
fram
was
cruising
some
way
out
but
when
we
came
near
enough
for
them
to
see
us
they
made
all
haste
to
come
in
to
the
yes
there
lay
our
good
little
ship
as
trim
as
when
we
had
last
seen
her
the
long
voyage
round
the
world
had
left
no
mark
on
her
strong
hull
along
the
bulwarks
appeared
a
row
of
smiling
faces
which
we
were
able
to
recognize
in
spite
of
the
big
beards
that
half
concealed
many
of
them
while
chins
had
been
the
fashion
at
framheim
almost
every
man
on
board
appeared
with
a
flowing
beard
as
we
came
over
the
gangway
questions
began
to
hail
upon
us
i
had
to
ask
for
a
moment
grace
to
give
the
captain
and
crew
a
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
and
then
i
collected
them
all
about
me
and
gave
a
short
account
of
the
most
important
events
of
the
past
year
when
this
was
done
captain
nilsen
pulled
me
into
the
where
we
had
a
talk
that
lasted
till
about
four
the
next
morning
to
both
of
us
certainly
one
of
the
most
interesting
we
have
ever
had
on
nilsen
asking
about
the
prospects
of
the
southern
party
i
ventured
to
assure
him
that
in
all
probability
we
should
have
our
chief
and
his
companions
back
in
a
few
days
with
the
pole
in
their
pockets
our
letters
from
home
brought
nothing
but
good
news
what
interested
us
most
in
the
newspapers
was
of
course
the
account
of
how
the
expedition
change
of
route
had
been
received
at
we
left
the
fram
and
returned
home
for
the
next
few
days
we
were
occupied
with
the
work
of
surveying
and
charting
which
went
comparatively
quickly
in
the
favourable
weather
when
we
returned
after
our
day
work
on
the
afternoon
of
the
we
found
lieutenant
gjertsen
back
at
the
hut
he
asked
us
if
we
could
guess
the
news
and
as
we
had
no
answer
ready
he
told
us
that
the
ship
of
the
japanese
expedition
had
arrived
we
hurriedly
got
out
the
cinematograph
apparatus
and
the
camera
and
went
off
as
fast
as
the
dogs
could
go
since
gjertsen
thought
this
visit
would
not
be
of
long
duration
when
we
caught
sight
of
the
fram
she
had
her
flag
up
and
just
beyond
the
nearest
cape
lay
the
kainan
maru
with
the
ensign
of
the
rising
sun
at
the
peak
banzai
we
had
come
in
time
although
it
was
rather
late
in
the
evening
nilsen
and
i
decided
to
pay
her
a
visit
and
if
possible
to
see
the
leader
of
the
expedition
we
were
received
at
the
gangway
by
a
young
smiling
fellow
who
beamed
still
more
when
i
produced
the
only
japanese
word
i
knew
oheio
there
the
conversation
came
to
a
full
stop
but
soon
a
number
of
the
inquisitive
sons
of
nippon
came
up
and
some
of
them
understood
a
little
english
we
did
not
get
very
far
however
we
found
out
that
the
kainan
maru
had
been
on
a
cruise
in
the
direction
of
king
edward
vii
land
but
we
could
not
ascertain
whether
any
landing
had
been
attempted
or
not
as
the
leader
of
the
expedition
and
the
captain
of
the
ship
had
turned
in
we
did
not
want
to
disturb
them
by
prolonging
our
visit
but
we
did
not
escape
before
the
genial
first
officer
had
offered
us
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
cigar
in
the
with
an
invitation
to
come
again
next
day
and
permission
to
take
some
photographs
we
returned
to
the
fram
but
nothing
came
of
the
projected
second
visit
to
our
japanese
friends
both
ships
put
out
to
sea
in
a
gale
that
sprang
up
during
the
night
and
before
we
had
another
opportunity
of
going
on
board
the
kainan
maru
the
southern
party
had
returned
the
days
immediately
preceding
the
departure
of
the
expedition
for
the
north
fell
about
the
middle
of
the
short
antarctic
summer
just
at
the
time
when
the
comparatively
rich
animal
life
of
the
bay
of
whales
shows
itself
at
its
best
the
name
of
the
bay
of
whales
is
due
to
shackleton
and
is
appropriate
enough
for
from
the
time
of
the
of
the
this
huge
inlet
in
the
barrier
forms
a
favourite
playground
for
whales
of
which
we
often
saw
schools
of
as
many
as
fifty
disporting
themselves
for
hours
together
we
had
no
means
of
disturbing
their
peaceful
sport
although
the
sight
of
all
these
monsters
each
worth
a
small
fortune
was
well
calculated
to
make
our
fingers
itch
it
was
the
whaling
demon
that
possessed
us
for
one
who
has
no
special
knowledge
of
the
industry
it
is
difficult
to
form
an
adequate
opinion
as
to
whether
this
part
of
antarctica
is
capable
of
ever
becoming
a
field
for
whaling
enterprise
in
any
case
it
will
probably
be
a
long
time
before
such
a
thing
happens
in
the
first
place
the
distance
to
the
nearest
inhabited
country
is
very
great
over
geographical
miles
and
in
the
second
there
is
a
serious
obstruction
on
this
route
in
the
shape
of
the
belt
of
which
narrow
and
loose
as
it
may
be
at
times
will
always
necessitate
the
employment
of
vessels
for
the
work
of
transport
the
conditions
prevailing
in
the
bay
of
whales
must
presumably
offer
a
decisive
obstacle
to
the
establishment
of
a
permanent
station
our
winter
house
was
snowed
under
in
the
course
of
two
months
and
to
us
this
was
only
a
source
of
satisfaction
as
our
quarters
became
all
the
warmer
on
this
account
but
whether
a
whaling
station
would
find
a
similar
fate
equally
convenient
is
rather
doubtful
lastly
it
must
be
said
that
although
in
the
bay
itself
huge
schools
of
whales
were
of
frequent
occurrence
we
did
not
receive
the
impression
that
there
was
any
very
great
number
of
them
out
in
ross
sea
the
species
most
commonly
seen
was
the
finner
after
that
the
blue
whale
as
regards
seals
they
appeared
in
great
quantities
along
the
edge
of
the
barrier
so
long
as
the
still
lay
there
after
the
of
the
ice
the
bay
of
whales
was
a
favourite
resort
of
theirs
all
through
the
summer
this
was
due
to
its
offering
them
an
easy
access
to
the
dry
surface
where
they
could
abandon
themselves
to
their
favourite
occupation
of
basking
in
the
sunshine
during
our
whole
stay
we
must
have
killed
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
by
far
the
greater
number
of
which
were
shot
in
the
autumn
immediately
after
our
arrival
this
little
inroad
had
no
appreciable
effect
the
numerous
survivors
who
had
been
of
their
companions
sudden
death
did
not
seem
to
have
the
slightest
idea
that
the
bay
of
whales
had
become
for
the
time
being
a
somewhat
unsafe
place
of
residence
as
early
as
september
while
the
ice
still
stretched
under
in
the
course
of
two
months
and
to
us

while
the

still
stretched
the
name
may
possibly
evoke
ideas
of
some
ferocious
creature
in
that
case
it
is
misleading
the
animal
that
bears
it
is
without
question
the
most
amicable
of
the
three
species
it
is
of
about
the
same
size
as
our
native
seal
brisk
and
active
in
its
movements
and
is
constantly
exercising
itself
in
high
jumps
from
the
water
on
to
the
even
on
the
ice
it
can
work
its
way
along
so
fast
that
it
is
all
a
man
can
do
to
keep
up
its
skin
is
extraordinarily
beautiful
grey
with
a
sheen
of
silver
and
small
dark
spots
one
is
often
asked
whether
seal
flesh
does
not
taste
of
train
oil
it
seems
to
be
a
common
assumption
that
it
does
so
this
however
is
a
mistake
the
oil
and
the
taste
of
it
are
only
present
in
the
layer
of
blubber
an
inch
thick
which
covers
the
seal
body
like
a
protective
armour
the
flesh
itself
contains
no
fat
on
the
other
hand
it
is
extremely
rich
in
blood
and
its
taste
in
consequence
reminds
one
of
the
flesh
of
the
weddell
seal
is
very
dark
in
colour
in
the
it
turns
quite
black
the
flesh
of
the
is
of
about
the
same
colour
as
beef
and
to
us
at
any
rate
its
taste
was
equally
good
we
therefore
always
tried
to
get
when
providing
food
for
ourselves
we
found
the
penguins
as
amusing
as
the
seals
were
useful
so
much
has
been
written
recently
about
these
remarkable
creatures
and
they
have
been
photographed
and
cinematographed
so
many
times
that
everyone
is
acquainted
with
them
nevertheless
anyone
who
sees
a
living
penguin
for
the
first
time
will
always
be
attracted
and
interested
both
by
the
dignified
emperor
penguin
with
his
three
feet
of
stature
and
by
the
bustling
little
adelie
not
only
in
their
upright
walk
but
also
in
their
manners
and
antics
these
birds
remind
one
strikingly
of
human
beings
it
has
been
remarked
that
an
emperor
is
the
very
image
of
an
old
gentleman
in
evening
dress
and
the
resemblance
is
indeed
very
noticeable
it
becomes
still
more
so
when
the
emperor
as
is
always
his
habit
approaches
the
stranger
with
a
series
of
ceremonious
bows
such
is
their
good
breeding
when
this
ceremony
is
over
the
penguin
will
usually
come
quite
close
he
is
entirely
unsuspecting
and
is
not
frightened
even
if
one
goes
slowly
towards
him
on
the
other
hand
if
one
approaches
rapidly
or
touches
him
he
is
afraid
and
immediately
takes
to
flight
it
sometimes
happens
though
that
he
shows
fight
and
then
it
is
wiser
to
keep
out
of
range
of
his
flippers
for
in
these
he
has
a
very
powerful
weapon
which
might
easily
break
a
man
arm
if
you
wish
to
attack
him
it
is
better
to
do
so
from
behind
both
flippers
must
be
seized
firmly
at
the
same
time
and
bent
backwards
along
his
back
then
the
fight
is
over
the
little
adelie
is
always
comic
on
meeting
a
flock
of
these
little
busybodies
the
most
observer
is
forced
to
burst
into
laughter
during
the
first
weeks
of
our
stay
in
the
bay
of
whales
while
we
were
still
unloading
stores
it
was
always
a
welcome
distraction
to
see
a
flock
of
adélie
penguins
to
the
number
of
a
dozen
or
so
suddenly
jump
out
of
the
water
as
though
at
a
word
of
command
and
then
sit
still
for
some
moments
stiff
with
astonishment
at
the
extraordinary
things
they
saw
when
they
had
recovered
from
the
first
surprise
they
generally
dived
into
the
sea
again
but
their
intense
curiosity
soon
drove
them
back
to
look
at
us
more
closely
in
contradistinction
to
their
calm
and
relative
the
emperor
penguin
these
active
little
creatures
have
an
extremely
fiery
temperament
which
makes
them
fly
into
a
passion
at
the
slightest
interference
with
their
affairs
and
this
of
course
only
makes
them
still
more
amusing
the
penguins
are
birds
of
passage
they
spend
the
winter
on
the
various
small
groups
of
islands
that
are
scattered
about
the
southern
ocean
on
the
arrival
of
spring
they
betake
themselves
to
antarctica
where
they
have
their
regular
rookeries
in
places
where
there
is
bare
ground
they
have
a
pronounced
taste
for
roaming
and
as
soon
as
the
chicks
are
grown
they
set
out
young
and
old
together
on
their
travels
it
was
only
as
tourists
that
the
penguins
visited
framheim
and
its
environs
for
there
was
of
course
no
bare
land
in
our
neighbourhood
that
might
offer
them
a
place
of
residence
for
this
reason
we
really
saw
comparatively
little
of
them
an
emperor
was
a
very
rare
visitor
but
the
few
occasions
on
which
we
met
these
peculiar
bird
people
of
antarctica
will
remain
among
the
most
delightful
memories
of
our
stay
in
the
bay
of
whales
chapter
xvi
the
voyage
of
the
fram
by
thorvald
nilsen
from
norway
to
the
barrier
after
the
fram
had
undergone
extensive
repairs
in
horten
dockyard
and
had
loaded
provisions
and
equipment
in
christiania
we
left
the
latter
port
on
june
according
to
the
plan
we
were
first
to
make
an
oceanographical
cruise
of
about
two
months
in
the
north
atlantic
and
then
to
return
to
norway
where
the
fram
was
to
be
docked
and
the
remaining
outfit
and
dogs
taken
on
board
this
oceanographical
cruise
was
in
many
respects
successful
in
the
first
place
we
gained
familiarity
with
the
vessel
and
got
everything
shipshape
for
the
long
voyage
to
come
but
the
best
of
all
was
that
we
acquired
valuable
experience
of
our
auxiliary
engine
this
is
a
diesel
motor
constructed
for
solar
oil
of
which
we
were
taking
about
litres
about
gallons
in
this
connection
it
may
be
mentioned
that
we
consumed
about
litres
about
gallons
a
day
and
that
the
fram
radius
of
action
was
thus
about
six
months
for
the
first
day
or
two
the
engine
went
well
enough
but
after
that
it
went
slower
and
slower
and
finally
stopped
of
its
own
accord
after
this
it
was
known
as
the
whooping
cough
this
happened
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
trip
the
had
constantly
to
be
taken
out
and
cleared
of
a
thick
black
deposit
as
possibly
our
whole
south
polar
expedition
would
depend
on
the
motor
doing
its
work
properly
the
result
of
this
was
that
the
projected
cruise
was
cut
short
and
after
a
lapse
of
three
weeks
our
course
was
set
for
bergen
where
we
changed
the
oil
for
refined
paraffin
and
at
the
same
time
had
the
motor
thoroughly
overhauled
since
then
there
has
never
been
anything
wrong
with
the
engine
from
bergen
we
went
to
christiansand
where
the
fram
was
docked
and
as
already
mentioned
the
remaining
outfit
with
the
dogs
and
was
taken
on
board
the
number
of
living
creatures
on
board
when
we
left
norway
was
nineteen
men
dogs
four
pigs
six
carrier
pigeons
and
one
canary
at
last
we
were
ready
to
leave
christiansand
on
thursday
august
and
at
nine
that
evening
the
anchor
was
got
up
and
the
motor
started
after
the
busy
time
we
had
had
no
doubt
we
were
all
glad
to
get
off
as
our
departure
had
not
been
made
public
only
the
pilot
and
a
few
acquaintances
accompanied
us
a
little
way
out
it
was
glorious
weather
and
everyone
stayed
on
deck
till
far
into
the
light
night
watching
the
land
slowly
disappear
all
the
dogs
were
chained
round
the
deck
on
which
we
also
had
coal
oil
timber
and
other
things
so
that
there
was
not
much
room
to
move
about
the
rest
of
the
vessel
was
absolutely
full
to
take
an
example
in
the
we
had
placed
sledging
cases
which
were
filled
with
books
christmas
presents
underclothing
and
the
like
in
addition
to
these
one
hundred
complete
sets
of
all
our
ski
etc
smaller
articles
were
stowed
in
the
cabins
and
every
man
had
something
when
i
complained
as
happened
pretty
often
that
i
could
not
imagine
where
this
or
that
was
to
be
put
the
chief
of
the
expedition
used
generally
to
say
oh
that
all
right
you
can
just
put
it
in
your
cabin
thus
it
was
with
every
imaginable
thing
from
barrels
of
paraffin
and
pups
to
writing
materials
and
charts
as
the
story
of
this
voyage
has
already
been
told
it
may
be
rapidly
passed
over
here
after
much
delay
through
headwinds
in
the
channel
we
picked
up
the
trade
in
about
the
latitude
of
gibraltar
and
arrived
at
madeira
on
september
at
on
september
we
weighed
anchor
for
the
last
time
and
left
madeira
as
soon
as
we
were
clear
of
the
land
we
got
the
trade
again
and
it
held
more
or
less
fresh
till
about
lat
after
our
departure
from
madeira
i
took
over
the
morning
watch
from
to
prestrud
and
gjertsen
divided
the
remainder
of
the
hours
in
order
if
possible
to
get
a
little
more
way
on
the
ship
a
and
a
skysail
were
rigged
up
with
two
awnings
it
did
not
increase
our
speed
very
much
but
no
doubt
it
helped
a
little
the
highest
temperature
we
observed
was
in
the
trade
winds
we
constantly
saw
but
as
far
as
i
know
not
one
was
ever
found
on
deck
those
that
came
on
board
were
of
course
instantly
snapped
up
by
the
dogs
in
about
lat
we
lost
the
trade
and
thus
came
into
the
belt
of
calms
a
belt
that
extends
on
each
side
of
the
equator
between
the
and
trades
here
as
a
rule
one
encounters
violent
to
sailing
ships
in
general
and
ourselves
in
particular
this
heavy
rain
is
welcome
as
can
be
filled
up
only
on
one
day
were
we
lucky
enough
to
have
rain
but
as
it
was
accompanied
by
a
strong
squall
of
wind
we
did
not
catch
all
the
water
we
wanted
all
hands
were
on
deck
carrying
water
some
in
oilskins
some
in
adam
costume
the
chief
in
a
white
tropical
suit
and
as
far
as
i
remember
clogs
as
the
latter
were
rather
slippery
and
the
fram
suddenly
gave
an
unexpected
lurch
he
was
carried
off
his
legs
and
left
sitting
on
the
deck
while
his
bucket
of
water
poured
all
over
him
but
it
was
all
in
his
country
cause
so
he
did
not
mind
we
caught
about
tons
of
water
and
then
had
our
tanks
full
or
about
tons
when
the
shower
passed
off
later
in
the
voyage
we
filled
a
bucket
now
and
again
but
it
never
amounted
to
much
and
if
we
had
not
been
as
careful
as
we
were
our
would
hardly
have
lasted
out
on
october
we
crossed
the
equator
the
trade
was
not
so
fresh
as
we
had
expected
and
the
engine
had
to
be
kept
going
the
whole
time
at
the
beginning
of
november
we
came
down
into
the
west
wind
belt
or
the
roaring
forties
as
they
are
called
and
from
that
time
we
ran
down
our
easting
at
a
great
rate
we
were
very
lucky
there
and
had
strong
fair
winds
for
nearly
seven
weeks
at
a
stretch
in
the
heavy
sea
we
found
out
what
it
was
to
sail
in
the
fram
she
rolls
incessantly
and
there
is
never
a
moment
rest
the
dogs
were
thrown
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
deck
and
when
one
of
them
rolled
into
another
it
was
taken
as
a
personal
insult
and
a
fight
followed
at
once
but
for
all
that
the
fram
is
a
sea
boat
and
hardly
ever
ships
any
water
if
this
had
been
otherwise
the
dogs
would
have
been
far
worse
off
than
they
were
the
weather
in
the
foggy
fifties
varied
between
gales
calms
fogs
snowstorms
and
other
delights
as
a
rule
the
engine
was
now
kept
constantly
ready
in
case
of
our
being
so
unlucky
as
to
come
too
near
an
iceberg
fortunately
however
we
did
not
meet
any
of
these
until
early
on
the
morning
of
january
when
we
saw
some
typical
antarctic
bergs
that
is
to
say
entirely
tabular
our
latitude
was
then
a
little
over
and
we
were
not
far
off
the
pack
on
the
and
we
sailed
southward
without
seeing
anything
but
scattered
bergs
and
a
constantly
increasing
number
of
lumps
of
ice
which
showed
us
we
were
getting
near
by
on
the
we
came
into
slack
the
weather
was
foggy
and
we
therefore
kept
going
as
near
as
might
be
on
the
course
to
the
bay
of
whales
which
was
destined
to
be
our
base
a
good
many
seals
were
lying
on
the
and
as
we
went
forward
we
shot
some
as
soon
as
the
first
seal
was
brought
on
board
all
our
dogs
had
their
first
meat
meal
since
madeira
they
were
given
as
much
as
they
wanted
and
ate
as
much
as
they
could
we
too
had
our
share
of
the
seal
and
from
this
time
forward
we
had
fresh
for
breakfast
at
least
every
day
it
tasted
excellent
to
us
who
for
nearly
half
a
year
had
been
living
on
nothing
but
tinned
meat
with
the
steak
whortleberries
were
always
served
which
of
course
helped
to
make
it
appreciated
the
biggest
seal
we
got
in
the
was
about
feet
long
and
weighed
nearly
half
a
ton
a
few
penguins
were
also
shot
mostly
adélie
penguins
these
are
extraordinarily
amusing
and
as
inquisitive
as
an
animal
can
be
when
any
of
them
saw
us
they
at
once
came
nearer
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
unbidden
guests
if
they
became
too
impertinent
we
did
not
hesitate
to
take
them
for
their
flesh
especially
the
liver
was
excellent
the
albatrosses
which
had
followed
us
through
the
whole
of
the
west
wind
belt
had
now
departed
and
in
their
place
came
the
beautiful
snowy
petrels
and
antarctic
petrels
we
had
more
or
less
fog
all
through
the
only
on
the
night
of
the
did
we
have
sun
and
fine
weather
when
we
saw
the
midnight
sun
for
the
first
time
a
more
beautiful
morning
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
radiantly
clear
with
thick
ice
everywhere
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
the
lanes
of
water
between
the
floes
gleamed
in
the
sun
and
the
glittered
like
thousands
of
diamonds
it
was
a
pure
delight
to
go
on
deck
and
drink
in
the
fresh
air
one
felt
altogether
a
new
man
i
believe
everyone
on
board
found
this
passage
through
the
pack
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
whole
voyage
and
of
course
it
all
had
the
charm
of
novelty
those
who
had
not
been
in
the
ice
before
myself
among
them
and
who
were
hunting
for
the
first
time
ran
about
after
seals
and
penguins
and
amused
themselves
like
children
at
on
the
we
were
already
out
of
the
ice
after
a
passage
of
exactly
four
days
we
had
been
extremely
lucky
and
the
fram
went
very
easily
through
the
ice
after
coming
out
of
the
pack
our
course
was
continued
through
the
open
ross
sea
to
the
bay
of
whales
which
from
the
previous
description
was
to
be
found
in
about
long
on
the
afternoon
of
the
we
had
strong
ahead
by
which
is
meant
the
luminous
stripe
that
is
seen
above
a
considerable
accumulation
of
ice
the
nearest
thing
one
can
compare
it
to
is
the
glare
that
is
always
seen
over
a
great
city
on
approaching
it
at
night
we
knew
at
once
that
this
was
the
glare
of
the
mighty
ross
barrier
named
after
sir
james
clark
ross
who
first
saw
it
in
the
barrier
is
a
wall
of
ice
several
hundred
miles
long
and
about
feet
high
which
forms
the
southern
boundary
of
ross
sea
we
were
of
course
very
intent
upon
seeing
what
it
looked
like
but
to
me
it
did
not
appear
so
imposing
as
i
had
imagined
it
possibly
this
was
because
i
had
become
familiar
with
it
in
a
way
from
the
many
descriptions
of
it
from
these
descriptions
we
had
expected
to
find
a
comparatively
narrow
opening
into
balloon
bight
as
shown
in
the
photographs
we
had
before
us
but
as
we
went
along
the
barrier
on
the
we
could
find
no
opening
in
long
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
great
break
in
the
wall
forming
a
cape
west
cape
from
here
to
the
other
side
of
the
barrier
was
about
eight
geographical
miles
and
southward
as
far
as
we
could
see
lay
loose
bay
ice
we
held
on
to
the
east
outside
this
and
along
the
eastern
barrier
till
past
midnight
but
as
balloon
bight
was
not
to
be
found
we
returned
to
the
break
or
cape
where
we
lay
during
the
whole
forenoon
of
the
as
the
ice
was
too
thick
to
allow
us
to
make
any
progress
after
midday
however
the
ice
loosened
and
began
to
drift
out
at
the
same
time
we
went
in
and
having
gone
as
far
as
possible
the
fram
was
moored
to
the
fast
on
the
western
side
of
the
great
bay
we
had
entered
it
proved
that
balloon
bight
and
another
bight
had
merged
to
form
a
great
bay
exactly
as
described
by
sir
ernest
shackleton
and
named
by
him
the
bay
of
whales
after
mooring
here
the
chief
and
one
or
two
others
went
on
a
reconnoitring
tour
but
it
began
to
snow
pretty
thickly
and
as
far
as
i
am
aware
nothing
was
accomplished
beyond
seeing
that
the
barrier
at
the
southernmost
end
of
the
bay
sloped
evenly
down
to
the
but
between
the
latter
and
the
slope
there
was
open
water
so
that
they
could
not
go
any
farther
we
lay
all
night
drifting
in
the
ice
which
was
constantly
breaking
up
and
during
this
time
several
seals
and
penguins
were
shot
towards
morning
on
the
it
became
quite
clear
and
we
had
a
splendid
view
of
the
surroundings
right
over
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
bay
it
looked
as
if
there
was
more
open
water
we
therefore
went
along
the
fast
and
moored
off
the
eastern
barrier
at
about
three
in
the
afternoon
the
cape
in
the
barrier
under
which
we
lay
was
given
the
name
of
man
head
on
account
of
its
resemblance
to
a
human
profile
all
the
time
we
were
going
along
the
ice
we
were
shooting
seals
so
that
on
arrival
at
our
final
moorings
we
already
had
a
good
supply
of
meat
for
my
part
i
was
rather
unlucky
on
one
of
these
hunts
four
seals
were
lying
on
the
and
i
jumped
down
with
rifle
and
five
cartridges
to
take
any
cartridges
in
reserve
did
not
occur
to
me
as
of
course
i
regarded
myself
as
a
mighty
hunter
and
thought
that
one
shot
per
seal
was
quite
enough
the
three
first
died
without
a
groan
but
the
fourth
took
the
alarm
and
made
off
as
fast
as
it
could
i
fired
my
fourth
cartridge
but
it
did
not
hit
as
it
ought
to
have
done
and
the
seal
was
in
full
flight
leaving
a
streak
of
blood
behind
it
i
was
not
anxious
to
let
a
wounded
seal
go
and
as
i
had
only
one
cartridge
left
and
the
seal
had
its
tail
turned
towards
me
i
wanted
to
come
to
close
quarters
to
make
sure
of
it
i
therefore
ran
as
hard
as
i
could
but
the
seal
was
quicker
and
it
determined
the
range
after
running
to
the
south
pole
i
summoned
my
remaining
strength
and
fired
the
last
shot
whether
the
bullet
went
above
or
below
i
have
no
idea
all
i
know
is
that
on
arriving
on
board
i
was
met
by
scornful
smiles
and
had
to
stand
a
good
deal
of
chaff
as
already
mentioned
we
left
norway
on
august
and
arrived
at
our
final
moorings
on
january
in
the
course
of
which
time
we
had
only
called
at
madeira
the
barrier
is
geographical
miles
from
norway
a
distance
which
we
took
five
months
to
cover
from
madeira
we
had
had
days
in
open
sea
and
therewith
the
first
part
of
the
voyage
was
brought
to
an
end
off
the
barrier
as
soon
as
we
had
moored
the
chief
prestrud
johansen
and
i
went
up
on
to
the
barrier
on
a
tour
of
reconnaissance
the
ascent
from
the
to
the
barrier
was
fine
a
perfectly
even
slope
when
no
more
than
a
mile
from
the
ship
we
found
a
good
site
for
the
first
and
another
mile
to
the
south
it
was
decided
that
the
house
was
to
stand
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
where
it
would
be
least
exposed
to
the
strong
gales
which
might
be
expected
from
previous
descriptions
up
on
the
barrier
all
was
absolutely
still
and
there
was
not
a
sign
of
life
indeed
what
should
anything
live
on
this
delightful
was
extended
a
little
farther
to
the
south
and
after
a
couple
of
hours
we
returned
on
board
here
in
the
meantime
the
slaughtering
of
seals
had
been
going
on
and
there
were
plenty
to
be
had
as
several
hundreds
of
them
lay
about
on
the
ice
after
the
rather
long
sea
voyage
and
the
cramped
quarters
on
board
i
must
say
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
firm
ground
under
one
feet
and
to
be
able
to
move
about
a
little
the
dogs
evidently
thought
the
same
when
they
came
down
on
to
the
ice
they
rolled
in
the
snow
and
ran
about
wild
with
delight
during
our
whole
stay
a
great
part
of
the
time
was
spent
in
and
and
an
agreeable
change
it
was
sunday
the
was
spent
in
setting
up
tents
at
the
first
and
at
framheim
as
the
winter
station
was
named
a
team
of
dogs
was
used
and
as
they
were
unused
to
being
driven
it
is
not
surprising
that
some
lay
down
others
fought
a
few
wanted
to
go
on
board
but
hardly
any
of
them
appreciated
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
or
understood
that
their
good
time
had
come
to
an
end
on
monday
all
the
dogs
were
landed
and
on
the
following
day
the
supplies
began
to
be
put
ashore
the
landing
of
the
cases
was
done
in
this
way
the
brought
up
on
deck
as
many
cases
as
the
drivers
could
take
in
one
journey
as
the
sledges
came
down
to
the
vessel
the
cases
were
sent
down
on
to
the
ice
on
skids
so
that
it
all
went
very
rapidly
we
would
not
put
the
cases
out
on
the
ice
before
the
sledges
came
back
as
in
case
the
ice
should
break
up
we
should
be
obliged
to
heave
them
all
on
board
again
or
we
might
even
lose
them
at
night
no
one
was
ever
allowed
to
stay
on
the
ice
before
we
reached
the
ice
we
had
counted
on
having
per
cent
of
idle
days
that
is
from
previous
descriptions
we
had
reckoned
on
having
such
bad
weather
half
the
time
that
the
fram
would
be
obliged
to
leave
her
moorings
in
this
respect
we
were
far
luckier
than
we
expected
and
only
had
to
put
out
twice
the
first
time
was
on
the
night
of
january
when
we
had
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
north
with
some
sea
so
that
the
vessel
was
bumping
rather
hard
against
the
ice
drifting
floes
came
down
upon
us
and
so
as
not
to
be
caught
by
any
iceberg
that
might
suddenly
come
sailing
in
from
the
point
of
the
barrier
we
called
man
head
we
took
our
moorings
on
board
and
went
when
the
shore
party
next
morning
came
down
as
usual
at
a
swinging
pace
they
saw
to
their
astonishment
that
the
fram
was
gone
in
the
course
of
the
day
the
weather
became
fine
and
we
tried
to
go
back
about
noon
but
the
bay
was
so
full
of
that
we
could
not
come
in
to
the
fast
about
nine
in
the
evening
we
saw
from
the
crow
nest
that
the
ice
was
loosening
we
made
the
attempt
and
by
midnight
we
were
again
moored
but
the
day
was
not
wasted
by
the
shore
party
for
on
the
day
before
kristensen
hansen
and
i
had
been
out
on
ski
and
had
shot
forty
seals
which
were
taken
up
to
the
station
while
we
were
away
only
once
or
twice
more
did
we
have
to
leave
our
berth
until
on
february
when
almost
all
the
ice
had
left
the
bay
we
were
able
to
moor
alongside
the
low
fast
barrier
where
we
lay
in
peace
until
we
went
for
good
there
was
a
great
deal
of
animal
life
about
us
a
number
of
whales
came
close
in
to
the
vessel
where
they
stayed
still
to
look
at
the
uninvited
guests
on
the
ice
seals
came
right
up
to
the
ship
as
did
large
and
small
flocks
of
penguins
to
have
a
look
at
us
these
latter
were
altogether
extraordinarily
inquisitive
creatures
two
emperor
penguins
often
came
to
our
last
moorings
to
watch
us
laying
out
an
or
hauling
on
a
hawser
while
they
put
their
heads
on
one
side
and
jabbered
and
they
were
given
the
names
of
the
and
his
missis
a
great
number
of
birds
skua
gulls
snowy
petrels
and
antarctic
petrels
flew
round
the
ship
and
gave
us
many
a
good
roast
ptarmigan
on
the
morning
of
february
about
the
watchman
beck
came
and
called
me
with
the
news
that
a
vessel
was
coming
in
i
guessed
at
once
of
course
that
it
was
the
terra
nova
but
i
must
confess
that
i
did
not
feel
inclined
to
turn
out
and
look
at
her
we
hoisted
the
colours
however
as
soon
as
she
was
moored
beck
told
me
some
of
her
party
went
ashore
presumably
to
look
for
the
house
they
did
not
find
it
though
and
at
beck
came
below
again
and
said
that
now
they
were
coming
on
board
so
then
i
turned
out
and
received
them
they
were
lieutenant
campbell
the
leader
of
captain
scott
second
shore
party
and
lieutenant
pennell
the
commander
of
the
terra
nova
they
naturally
asked
a
number
of
questions
and
evidently
had
some
difficulty
in
believing
that
it
was
actually
the
fram
that
was
lying
here
we
had
at
first
been
taken
for
a
whaler
they
offered
to
take
our
mail
to
new
zealand
but
we
had
no
mail
ready
and
had
to
decline
the
offer
with
thanks
later
in
the
day
a
number
of
the
terra
nova
officers
went
to
breakfast
at
framheim
and
the
chief
prestrud
and
i
lunched
with
them
at
about
two
in
the
afternoon
the
terra
nova
sailed
again
on
friday
february
a
number
of
the
shore
party
started
on
the
first
trip
to
lay
down
depots
we
cleared
up
filled
our
with
snow
and
made
the
ship
ready
for
sea
we
had
finished
this
by
the
evening
of
the
from
the
bay
of
whales
to
buenos
aires
the
sea
party
consisted
of
the
following
ten
men
thorvald
nilsen
hansen
kristensen
and
nödtvedt
gjertsen
beck
rönne
kutschin
and
sundbeck
the
first
four
formed
one
watch
from
eight
to
two
and
the
last
five
the
other
from
two
to
eight
last
but
not
least
comes
olsen
cook
having
made
ready
for
sea
we
let
go
our
moorings
on
the
ice
barrier
at
on
february
hassel
wisting
bjaaland
and
stubberud
came
down
to
see
us
off
as
in
the
course
of
the
last
few
days
the
ice
had
broken
up
right
to
the
end
of
the
bay
we
went
as
far
south
as
possible
to
take
a
sounding
the
shallowest
we
got
was
fathoms
metres
the
bay
ended
in
a
ridge
of
ice
on
the
east
which
was
continued
in
a
northerly
direction
so
that
at
the
spot
where
we
were
stopped
by
the
barrier
we
reached
the
most
southerly
point
that
a
vessel
can
attain
so
long
as
the
barrier
remains
as
it
is
now
highest
latitude
when
the
terra
nova
was
here
her
latitude
and
ours
was
the
last
two
days
before
our
departure
had
been
calm
and
a
thick
dense
sludge
lay
over
the
whole
bay
so
dense
was
it
that
the
fram
lost
her
way
altogether
and
we
had
to
keep
going
ahead
and
astern
until
we
came
out
into
a
channel
seals
by
the
hundred
were
lying
on
the
floes
but
as
we
had
a
quantity
of
seal
flesh
we
left
them
in
peace
for
a
change
before
the
chief
began
the
laying
out
of
depots
i
received
from
him
the
following
orders
to
thorvald
nilsen
with
the
departure
of
the
fram
from
the
ice
barrier
you
will
take
over
the
command
on
board
in
accordance
with
the
plan
we
have
mutually
agreed
upon
you
will
sail
direct
to
buenos
aires
where
the
necessary
repairs
will
be
executed
provisions
taken
on
board
and
the
crew
completed
when
this
has
been
done
you
will
sail
from
buenos
aires
to
carry
out
oceanographical
observations
in
the
south
atlantic
ocean
it
would
be
desirable
if
you
could
investigate
the
conditions
between
south
america
and
africa
in
two
sections
these
investigations
must
however
be
dependent
on
the
prevailing
conditions
and
on
the
time
at
your
disposal
when
the
time
arrives
you
will
return
to
buenos
aires
where
the
final
preparations
will
be
made
for
your
departure
for
the
ice
barrier
to
take
off
the
shore
party
the
sooner
you
can
make
your
way
in
to
the
barrier
in
the
better
i
mention
no
time
as
everything
depends
on
circumstances
and
i
leave
it
to
you
to
act
according
to
your
judgment
in
all
else
that
concerns
the
interests
of
the
expedition
i
leave
you
entire
freedom
of
action
if
on
your
return
to
the
barrier
you
should
find
that
i
am
prevented
by
illness
or
death
from
taking
over
the
leadership
of
the
expedition
i
place
this
in
your
hands
and
beg
you
most
earnestly
to
endeavour
to
carry
out
the
original
plan
of
the
expedition
the
exploration
of
the
north
polar
basin
with
thanks
for
the
time
we
have
spent
together
and
in
the
hope
that
when
we
meet
again
we
shall
have
reached
our
respective
goals
i
am
yours
sincerely
roald
amundsen
when
sir
james
ross
was
in
these
waters
for
the
first
time
in
he
marked
appearance
of
land
in
long
and
lat
about
afterwards
in
captain
scott
named
this
land
king
edward
vii
land
one
of
the
terra
nova
objects
was
to
explore
this
land
but
when
we
met
the
ship
on
february
they
told
us
on
board
that
on
account
of
the
ice
conditions
they
had
not
been
able
to
land
as
no
one
had
ever
been
ashore
there
i
thought
it
might
be
interesting
to
go
and
see
what
it
looked
like
consequently
our
course
was
laid
along
the
barrier
during
the
night
a
thick
came
on
and
it
was
only
now
and
then
that
we
could
see
the
barrier
over
our
heads
all
of
a
sudden
we
were
close
upon
a
lofty
iceberg
so
that
we
had
to
put
the
helm
hard
over
to
go
clear
the
fram
steers
splendidly
however
when
she
is
in
proper
trim
and
turns
as
if
on
a
pivot
besides
which
it
was
calm
as
the
day
advanced
the
weather
cleared
more
and
more
and
by
noon
it
was
perfectly
clear
the
sight
that
then
met
us
was
the
lofty
barrier
to
starboard
and
elsewhere
all
round
about
some
fifty
icebergs
great
and
small
the
barrier
rose
from
about
feet
at
its
edge
to
something
like
feet
we
followed
the
barrier
for
some
distance
but
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cape
colbeck
we
met
the
and
as
i
had
no
wish
to
come
between
this
and
the
barrier
we
stood
out
in
a
direction
there
is
besides
the
disadvantage
about
a
propeller
like
ours
that
it
is
apt
to
wear
out
the
brasses
so
that
these
have
to
be
renewed
from
time
to
time
it
was
imperative
that
this
should
be
done
before
we
came
into
the
and
the
sooner
the
better
when
therefore
we
had
gone
along
the
barrier
for
about
a
day
and
a
half
without
seeing
any
bare
land
we
set
our
course
in
open
water
and
after
we
had
come
some
way
out
we
got
a
slant
of
easterly
wind
so
that
the
sails
could
be
set
we
saw
the
land
and
the
glare
above
it
all
night
the
date
had
not
yet
been
changed
but
as
this
had
to
be
done
it
was
changed
on
february
at
noon
on
the
the
propeller
was
lifted
and
by
the
evening
of
the
the
job
was
done
a
record
in
spite
of
the
temperature
capital
fellows
to
work
our
engineers
on
the
night
of
the
we
saw
the
midnight
sun
unfortunately
for
the
last
time
the
same
night
something
dark
was
sighted
on
the
port
bow
in
that
light
it
looked
very
like
an
islet
the
sounding
apparatus
was
got
ready
and
we
who
were
on
watch
of
course
saw
ourselves
in
our
minds
as
great
discoverers
i
was
already
wondering
what
would
be
the
most
appropriate
name
to
give
it
but
alas
the
discovery
became
clearer
and
the
name
well
it
was
a
rather
prosaic
one
dead
whale
islet
for
it
turned
out
to
be
a
huge
inflated
whale
that
was
drifting
covered
with
birds
we
went
rather
slowly
under
sail
alone
on
the
morning
of
the
we
saw
on
the
starboard
bow
and
about
noon
we
were
close
to
the
pack
itself
it
was
here
quite
thick
and
raised
by
pressure
so
that
an
attempt
to
get
through
it
was
out
of
the
question
we
were
therefore
obliged
to
follow
the
ice
to
the
west
due
aft
we
saw
in
the
sky
the
same
glare
as
above
the
great
ice
barrier
which
may
possibly
show
that
the
barrier
turns
towards
the
north
and
besides
which
the
masses
of
that
collect
here
must
go
to
show
that
it
encounters
an
obstruction
probably
the
barrier
when
we
went
out
in
the
ice
lay
in
exactly
the
same
place
and
in
the
same
way
our
course
was
still
to
the
west
along
the
and
it
was
not
till
the
that
we
could
turn
her
nose
northward
again
for
a
change
we
now
had
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
with
thick
snow
so
we
got
on
very
well
on
the
whole
the
fram
goes
much
more
easily
through
the
water
now
than
on
the
way
south
her
bottom
has
probably
been
cleaned
by
the
cold
water
and
all
the
scraping
against
the
ice
besides
which
we
have
no
more
than
a
third
of
the
load
with
which
we
left
norway
on
the
night
of
the
we
had
to
light
the
again
and
now
the
days
grew
rapidly
shorter
it
may
possibly
be
a
good
thing
to
have
dark
nights
on
land
but
at
sea
it
ought
always
to
be
light
especially
in
these
waters
which
are
more
or
less
unknown
and
full
of
drifting
icebergs
at
on
the
we
entered
the
in
lat
long
the
ice
was
much
higher
and
uglier
than
when
we
were
going
south
but
as
there
was
nothing
but
ice
as
far
as
we
could
see
both
east
and
west
and
it
was
fairly
loose
we
had
to
make
the
attempt
where
there
seemed
to
be
the
best
chance
of
getting
through
the
seals
which
to
the
south
of
the
ice
had
been
following
us
in
decreasing
numbers
had
now
disappeared
almost
entirely
and
curiously
enough
we
saw
very
few
seals
in
the
pack
luckily
however
lieutenant
gjertsen
watch
got
three
seals
and
for
a
week
we
were
able
to
enjoy
popularly
known
as
crocodile
beef
three
times
a
day
and
fresh
whortleberries
delicioso
we
went
comparatively
well
through
the
ice
though
at
night
from
eleven
to
one
we
had
to
slacken
speed
as
it
was
impossible
to
steer
clear
on
account
of
the
darkness
and
towards
morning
we
had
a
heavy
fall
of
snow
so
that
nothing
could
be
seen
and
the
engine
had
to
be
stopped
when
it
cleared
at
about
we
had
come
into
a
dam
out
of
which
we
luckily
managed
to
turn
fairly
easily
coming
out
into
a
bay
this
was
formed
by
over
a
hundred
icebergs
many
of
which
lay
in
contact
with
each
other
and
had
packed
the
ice
close
together
on
the
west
was
the
outlet
which
we
steered
for
and
by
on
february
we
were
already
out
of
the
ice
and
in
open
water
our
latitude
was
then
longitude
it
is
very
curious
to
find
such
calm
weather
in
ross
sea
in
the
two
months
we
have
been
here
we
have
hardly
had
a
strong
breeze
thus
when
i
was
relieved
at
on
the
i
wrote
in
my
diary
it
is
calm
not
a
ripple
on
the
water
the
three
men
forming
the
watch
walk
up
and
down
the
deck
now
and
then
one
hears
the
cry
kva
kva
but
except
these
there
is
no
other
sound
than
the
tuff
tuff
of
the
motor
times
a
minute
ah
that
motor
it
goes
unweariedly
it
has
now
gone
for
hours
without
being
cleaned
while
on
our
atlantic
cruise
last
year
it
stopped
dead
after
going
for
eighty
hours
right
over
us
we
have
the
southern
cross
all
round
glow
the
splendid
southern
lights
and
in
the
darkness
can
be
seen
the
gleaming
outline
of
an
iceberg
on
the
we
crossed
the
antarctic
circle
and
the
same
day
the
temperature
both
of
air
and
water
rose
above
it
was
with
sorrow
in
our
hearts
that
we
ate
our
last
piece
of
crocodile
beef
but
i
hoped
we
should
get
a
good
many
albatrosses
which
we
saw
as
soon
as
we
came
out
of
the
ice
they
were
mostly
the
sooty
albatross
that
tireless
bird
that
generally
circles
alone
about
the
ship
and
is
so
difficult
to
catch
as
he
seldom
tries
to
bite
at
the
pork
that
is
used
as
bait
when
i
saw
these
birds
for
the
first
time
as
a
deck
boy
i
was
told
they
were
called
parsons
because
they
were
the
souls
of
ungodly
clergymen
who
had
to
wait
down
here
till
doomsday
without
rest
more
or
less
in
our
course
to
cape
horn
there
are
supposed
to
be
two
groups
of
islands
the
nimrod
group
in
about
long
and
dougherty
island
in
about
long
they
are
both
marked
d
doubtful
on
the
english
charts
lieutenant
shackleton
vessel
the
nimrod
captain
davis
searched
for
both
but
found
neither
dougherty
island
however
is
said
to
have
been
twice
sighted
the
fram
course
was
therefore
laid
for
the
nimrod
group
for
a
time
things
went
very
well
but
then
we
had
a
week
of
northerly
winds
that
is
head
winds
and
when
at
last
we
had
a
fair
wind
again
we
were
so
far
to
the
of
them
that
there
was
no
sense
in
sailing
back
to
the
to
look
for
doubtful
islands
it
would
certainly
have
taken
us
weeks
consequently
our
course
was
laid
for
dougherty
island
we
had
westerly
winds
for
about
two
weeks
and
were
only
two
or
three
days
sail
from
the
island
in
question
when
suddenly
we
had
a
gale
from
the
which
lasted
for
three
days
and
ended
in
a
hurricane
from
the
same
quarter
when
this
was
over
we
had
come
according
to
dead
reckoning
about
eighty
nautical
miles
to
the
of
the
island
the
heavy
swell
which
lasted
for
days
made
it
out
of
the
question
to
attempt
to
go
against
it
with
the
motor
we
hardly
had
a
glimpse
of
sun
or
stars
and
weeks
passed
without
our
being
able
to
get
an
observation
so
that
for
that
matter
we
might
easily
be
a
degree
or
two
out
in
our
reckoning
for
the
present
therefore
we
must
continue
to
regard
these
islands
as
doubtful
moral
do
go
on
voyages
of
discovery
my
friend
you
no
good
at
it
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
ross
sea
and
had
entered
the
south
pacific
ocean
the
old
circus
started
again
in
other
words
the
fram
began
her
everlasting
rolling
from
one
side
to
the
other
when
this
was
at
its
worst
and
cups
and
plates
were
dancing
the
fandango
in
the
galley
its
occupant
only
wish
was
oh
to
be
in
buenos
aires
for
that
matter
it
is
not
a
very
easy
job
to
be
cook
in
such
circumstances
but
ours
was
always
in
a
good
humour
singing
and
whistling
all
day
long
how
well
the
fram
understands
the
art
of
rolling
is
shown
by
the
following
little
episode
one
afternoon
a
couple
of
us
were
sitting
drinking
coffee
on
a
that
stood
outside
the
galley
as
would
have
it
during
one
of
the
lurches
the
lashing
came
loose
and
the
box
shot
along
the
deck
suddenly
it
was
checked
by
an
obstacle
and
one
of
those
who
were
sitting
on
it
flew
into
the
air
through
the
galley
door
and
dashed
past
the
cook
with
a
splendid
tiger
leap
until
he
landed
face
downwards
at
the
other
end
of
the
galley
still
clinging
like
grim
death
to
his
cup
as
though
he
wanted
something
to
hold
on
to
the
face
he
presented
after
this
successful
feat
of
aviation
was
extremely
comical
and
those
who
saw
it
had
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
as
has
already
been
said
we
went
very
well
for
a
time
after
reaching
the
pacific
a
fair
wind
for
fourteen
days
together
and
i
began
to
hope
that
we
were
once
more
in
what
are
called
the
westerlies
however
nothing
is
perfect
in
this
world
and
we
found
that
out
here
as
we
had
icebergs
every
day
and
were
constantly
bothered
by
or
fog
the
former
were
of
course
to
be
preferred
as
it
was
at
any
rate
clear
between
the
squalls
but
fog
is
the
worst
thing
of
all
it
sometimes
happened
that
all
hands
were
on
deck
the
whole
night
to
work
the
ship
at
a
moment
notice
and
there
were
never
less
than
two
men
on
the
lookout
forward
the
engine
too
was
always
ready
to
be
started
instantly
a
little
example
will
show
how
ready
the
crew
were
at
any
time
one
sunday
afternoon
when
hansen
kristensen
and
i
were
on
watch
the
wind
began
to
draw
ahead
so
that
we
had
to
beat
it
was
blowing
quite
freshly
but
i
did
not
want
to
call
the
watch
below
as
they
might
need
all
the
sleep
they
could
get
and
hansen
and
i
were
to
put
the
ship
about
kristensen
was
steering
but
gave
us
a
hand
when
he
could
leave
the
wheel
as
the
ship
luffed
up
into
the
wind
and
the
sails
began
to
flap
pretty
violently
the
whole
of
the
watch
below
suddenly
came
rushing
on
deck
in
nothing
but
their
unmentionables
and
started
to
haul
chance
willed
it
that
at
the
same
moment
an
iceberg
came
out
of
the
fog
right
in
front
of
our
bows
it
was
not
many
minutes
either
before
we
were
on
the
other
tack
and
the
watch
below
did
not
linger
long
on
deck
with
so
few
clothes
on
it
was
no
pleasure
to
be
out
in
that
cold
foggy
air
they
slept
so
lightly
then
that
it
took
no
more
noise
than
that
to
wake
them
when
i
afterwards
asked
one
of
them
i
think
it
was
beck
what
made
them
think
of
coming
up
he
replied
that
they
thought
we
were
going
to
run
into
an
iceberg
and
were
trying
to
get
out
of
the
way
it
has
happened
at
night
that
i
have
seen
the
as
far
off
as
eight
miles
and
then
there
is
nothing
to
fear
but
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
day
we
have
sailed
close
to
icebergs
that
have
only
been
seen
a
few
minutes
before
we
were
right
on
them
as
the
voyage
was
long
we
sailed
as
fast
as
we
could
as
a
rule
but
on
two
or
three
nights
we
had
to
reduce
our
way
to
a
minimum
as
we
could
not
see
much
farther
than
the
end
of
the
bowsprit
after
two
or
three
weeks
sailing
the
icebergs
began
gradually
to
decrease
and
i
hoped
we
should
soon
come
to
the
end
of
them
but
on
sunday
march
when
it
was
fairly
clear
we
saw
about
midday
a
whole
lot
of
big
bergs
ahead
one
of
the
watch
below
who
had
just
come
on
deck
exclaimed
what
the
devil
is
this
beastly
mess
you
fellows
have
got
into
he
might
well
ask
for
in
the
course
of
that
afternoon
we
passed
no
less
than
about
a
hundred
bergs
they
were
big
tabular
bergs
all
of
the
same
height
about
feet
or
about
as
high
as
the
of
the
fram
the
bergs
were
not
the
least
worn
but
looked
as
if
they
had
calved
quite
recently
as
i
said
it
was
clear
enough
we
even
got
an
observation
that
day
lat
long
and
as
we
had
a
west
wind
we
twisted
quite
elegantly
past
one
iceberg
after
another
the
sea
which
during
the
morning
had
been
high
enough
for
the
spray
to
dash
over
the
tops
of
the
bergs
gradually
went
down
and
in
the
evening
when
we
were
well
to
leeward
of
them
all
it
was
as
smooth
as
if
we
had
been
in
harbour
in
the
course
of
the
night
we
passed
a
good
many
more
bergs
and
the
next
day
we
only
saw
about
twenty
in
the
various
descriptions
of
voyages
in
these
waters
opinions
are
divided
as
to
the
temperature
of
the
water
falling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
icebergs
that
it
falls
steadily
as
one
approaches
the
is
certain
enough
but
whether
it
falls
for
one
or
a
few
scattered
icebergs
no
doubt
depends
on
circumstances
one
night
at
we
had
a
temperature
in
the
water
of
at
and
at
at
we
passed
an
iceberg
at
noon
the
temperature
had
risen
to
in
this
case
one
might
say
that
the
temperature
gave
warning
but
as
a
rule
in
high
latitudes
it
has
been
constant
both
before
and
after
passing
an
iceberg
on
christmas
eve
when
on
our
second
trip
southward
we
saw
the
first
real
iceberg
the
temperature
of
the
water
fell
in
four
hours
from
to
which
was
the
temperature
when
the
bergs
were
passed
after
which
it
rose
rather
rapidly
to
in
the
west
wind
belt
i
believe
one
can
tell
with
some
degree
of
certainty
when
one
is
approaching
ice
in
the
middle
of
november
between
prince
edward
island
and
the
crozet
islands
about
lat
the
temperature
fell
towards
morning
i
remarked
to
someone
the
temperature
of
the
water
is
falling
as
if
we
were
getting
near
the
ice
on
the
forenoon
of
the
same
day
we
sailed
past
a
very
small
berg
the
temperature
again
rose
to
the
normal
and
we
met
no
more
ice
until
christmas
eve
on
saturday
march
the
day
before
we
met
that
large
collection
of
bergs
the
temperature
fell
pretty
rapidly
from
to
we
had
not
then
seen
ice
for
nearly
hours
at
the
same
time
the
colour
of
the
water
became
unusually
green
and
it
is
possible
that
we
had
come
into
a
cold
current
the
temperature
remained
as
low
as
this
till
sunday
morning
when
at
it
rose
to
at
noon
close
to
a
berg
to
and
a
mile
to
lee
of
it
to
it
continued
to
rise
and
at
when
the
bergs
were
thickest
it
was
at
and
at
midnight
if
there
had
been
a
fog
we
should
certainly
have
thought
we
were
leaving
the
ice
instead
of
approaching
it
it
is
very
curious
too
that
the
temperature
of
the
water
should
not
be
more
constant
in
the
presence
of
such
a
great
quantity
of
ice
but
as
i
have
said
it
may
have
been
a
current
in
the
course
of
the
week
following
march
the
bergs
became
rarer
but
the
same
kind
of
weather
prevailed
our
speed
was
irreproachable
and
in
one
day
work
from
noon
to
noon
we
covered
a
distance
of
nautical
miles
or
an
average
of
about
knots
an
hour
which
was
the
best
day
work
the
fram
had
done
up
to
that
time
the
wind
which
had
been
westerly
and
went
by
degrees
to
the
north
and
ended
in
a
hurricane
from
the
on
sunday
march
i
shall
quote
here
what
i
wrote
about
this
in
my
diary
on
the
well
now
we
have
experienced
the
first
hurricane
on
the
fram
on
saturday
afternoon
the
the
wind
went
to
the
as
an
ordinary
breeze
with
rain
the
barometer
had
been
steady
between
inches
millimetres
and
inches
millimetres
during
the
afternoon
it
began
to
fall
and
at
it
was
inches
millimetres
without
the
wind
having
freshened
at
all
the
outer
jib
was
taken
in
however
by
midnight
the
barometer
had
fallen
to
inches
millimetres
while
the
wind
had
increased
to
a
stiff
breeze
we
took
in
the
foresail
mainsail
and
inner
jib
and
had
now
only
the
topsail
and
a
left
the
wind
gradually
increased
to
a
gale
at
on
sunday
the
barometer
had
fallen
again
to
inches
millimetres
and
at
the
topsail
was
made
fast
the
wind
increased
and
the
seas
ran
higher
but
we
did
not
ship
much
water
at
the
barometer
was
inches
millimetres
and
at
inches
millimetres
when
at
last
it
stopped
going
down
and
remained
steady
till
about
noon
during
which
time
a
furious
hurricane
was
blowing
the
clouds
were
brown
the
colour
of
chocolate
i
can
not
remember
ever
having
seen
such
an
ugly
sky
little
by
little
the
wind
went
to
the
north
and
we
sailed
large
under
two
finally
we
had
the
seas
on
our
beam
and
now
the
fram
showed
herself
in
all
her
glory
as
the
best
in
the
world
it
was
extraordinary
to
watch
how
she
behaved
enormous
seas
came
surging
high
to
windward
and
we
who
were
standing
on
the
bridge
turned
our
backs
to
receive
them
with
some
such
remark
as
that
a
nasty
one
coming
but
the
sea
never
came
a
few
yards
from
the
ship
it
looked
over
the
bulwarks
and
got
ready
to
hurl
itself
upon
her
but
at
the
last
moment
the
fram
gave
a
wriggle
of
her
body
and
was
instantly
at
the
top
of
the
wave
which
slipped
under
the
vessel
can
anyone
be
surprised
if
one
gets
fond
of
such
a
ship
then
she
went
down
with
the
speed
of
lightning
from
the
top
of
the
wave
into
the
trough
a
fall
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
yards
when
we
sank
like
this
it
gave
one
the
same
feeling
as
dropping
from
the
twelfth
to
the
in
an
american
express
elevator
if
everything
inside
you
was
coming
up
it
was
so
quick
that
we
seemed
to
be
lifted
off
the
deck
we
went
up
and
down
like
this
all
the
afternoon
and
evening
till
during
the
night
the
wind
gradually
dropped
and
it
became
calm
that
the
storm
would
not
be
of
long
duration
might
almost
be
assumed
from
its
suddenness
and
the
english
rule
long
foretold
long
last
short
notice
soon
past
may
thus
be
said
to
have
held
good
when
there
is
a
strong
wind
on
her
beam
the
fram
does
not
roll
so
much
as
usual
except
for
an
occasional
leeward
lurch
nor
was
any
excessive
quantity
of
water
shipped
in
this
boisterous
sea
the
watch
went
below
as
usual
when
they
were
relieved
and
as
somebody
very
truly
remarked
all
hands
might
quite
well
have
turned
in
if
we
had
not
had
to
keep
a
lookout
for
ice
and
fortune
willed
it
that
the
day
of
the
hurricane
was
the
first
since
we
had
left
the
barrier
that
we
did
not
see
ice
whether
this
was
because
the
spray
was
so
high
that
it
hid
our
view
or
because
there
really
was
none
be
that
as
it
may
the
main
thing
was
that
we
saw
no
ice
during
the
night
we
had
a
glimpse
of
the
full
moon
which
gave
the
man
at
the
wheel
occasion
to
call
out
and
with
good
reason
as
we
had
been
waiting
a
long
time
for
the
moon
to
help
us
in
looking
out
for
ice
in
weather
like
this
one
notices
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
below
deck
here
hardly
anything
is
heard
of
the
wind
and
in
the
which
is
below
the
it
is
perfectly
comfortable
the
cook
who
resides
below
therefore
reckons
weather
according
to
the
motion
of
the
vessel
and
not
according
to
storms
fog
or
rain
on
deck
we
do
not
mind
much
how
it
blows
so
long
as
it
is
only
clear
and
the
wind
is
not
against
us
how
little
one
hears
below
deck
may
be
understood
from
the
fact
that
yesterday
morning
while
it
was
blowing
a
hurricane
the
cook
went
about
as
usual
whistling
his
two
verses
of
whistling
bowery
boy
while
he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
first
i
came
by
and
told
him
that
it
was
blowing
a
hurricane
if
he
cared
to
see
what
it
looked
like
yes
he
said
could
guess
it
was
blowing
for
the
galley
fire
has
never
drawn
so
well
the
bits
of
coal
are
flying
up
the
chimney
and
then
he
whistled
through
the
second
verse
all
the
same
he
could
not
resist
going
up
to
see
it
was
not
long
before
he
came
down
again
with
a
word
it
is
blowing
and
waves
up
to
the
sky
no
it
was
warmer
and
more
cosy
below
among
his
pots
and
pans
for
dinner
which
was
eaten
as
usual
amid
cheerful
conversation
we
had
soup
roast
sirloin
with
a
glass
of
aquavit
and
caramel
pudding
so
it
may
be
seen
that
the
cook
was
not
behindhand
in
opening
tins
even
in
a
hurricane
after
dinner
we
enjoyed
our
usual
sunday
cigar
while
the
canary
which
has
become
kristensen
pet
and
hangs
in
his
cabin
sang
at
the
top
of
its
voice
on
march
we
saw
the
last
iceberg
during
the
whole
trip
we
had
seen
and
passed
between
and
bergs
the
wind
held
steady
from
the
for
a
week
and
a
half
and
i
was
beginning
to
think
we
should
be
stuck
down
here
to
play
the
flying
dutchman
there
was
every
possible
sign
of
a
west
wind
but
it
did
not
come
on
the
night
of
the
it
cleared
light
cirrus
clouds
covered
the
sky
and
there
was
a
ring
about
the
moon
this
together
with
the
heavy
swell
and
the
pronounced
fall
of
the
barometer
showed
that
something
might
be
expected
and
sure
enough
on
sunday
march
we
were
in
a
cyclone
by
manoeuvring
according
to
the
rules
for
avoiding
a
cyclone
in
the
southern
hemisphere
we
at
any
rate
went
well
clear
of
one
semicircle
about
on
sunday
afternoon
the
barometer
was
down
to
inches
millimetres
the
lowest
barometer
reading
i
have
ever
heard
of
from
noon
to
there
was
a
calm
with
heavy
sea
immediately
after
a
gale
sprang
up
from
the
and
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
days
it
slowly
moderated
to
a
breeze
from
the
same
quarter
sunday
march
a
hundred
icebergs
sunday
march
a
hurricane
and
sunday
march
a
cyclone
truly
three
pleasant
days
of
rest
the
curves
given
on
the
next
page
which
show
the
course
of
barometric
pressure
for
a
week
from
monday
to
monday
are
interesting
by
way
of
comparison
a
third
curve
is
given
from
the
trade
where
there
is
an
almost
constant
breeze
and
fine
weather
on
this
trip
the
was
converted
into
a
where
rönne
and
hansen
carried
on
their
work
each
in
his
watch
the
was
used
as
a
common
as
it
is
warmer
and
the
motion
is
far
less
felt
than
forward
from
the
middle
of
march
it
looked
as
if
the
equinoctial
gales
were
over
for
we
had
quite
fine
weather
all
the
way
to
buenos
aires
cape
horn
was
passed
on
march
in
the
most
delightful
weather
a
light
westerly
breeze
not
a
cloud
in
the
sky
and
only
a
very
slight
swell
from
the
west
who
would
have
guessed
that
such
splendid
weather
was
to
be
found
in
these
parts
and
that
in
march
the
most
stormy
month
of
the
year
lieutenant
gjertsen
and
kutschin
collected
plankton
all
the
time
the
latter
smiled
all
over
his
face
whenever
he
chanced
to
get
one
or
two
tadpoles
in
his
from
the
falkland
islands
onward
the
fram
was
washed
and
painted
so
that
we
might
not
present
too
polar
an
appearance
on
arrival
at
buenos
aires
it
may
be
mentioned
as
a
curious
fact
that
the
snow
with
which
we
filled
our
on
the
barrier
did
not
melt
till
we
were
in
the
river
la
plata
which
shows
what
an
even
temperature
is
maintained
in
the
fram
hold
about
midday
on
easter
sunday
we
were
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
la
plata
without
seeing
land
however
during
the
night
the
weather
became
perfect
a
breeze
from
the
south
moonlight
and
starry
and
we
went
up
the
river
by
soundings
and
observations
of
the
stars
until
at
on
monday
when
we
had
the
recalada
right
ahead
we
had
not
seen
any
light
since
we
left
madeira
on
september
at
the
same
morning
we
got
a
pilot
aboard
and
at
seven
in
the
evening
we
anchored
in
the
roads
of
buenos
aires
we
had
then
been
nearly
once
round
the
world
and
for
over
seven
months
the
anchor
had
not
been
out
we
had
reckoned
on
a
two
months
voyage
from
the
ice
and
it
had
taken
us
days
the
oceanographical
cruise
according
to
the
programme
the
fram
was
to
go
on
an
oceanographical
cruise
in
the
south
atlantic
and
my
orders
were
that
this
was
to
be
arranged
to
suit
the
existing
circumstances
i
had
reckoned
on
a
cruise
of
about
three
months
we
should
have
to
leave
buenos
aires
at
the
beginning
of
october
to
be
down
in
the
ice
at
the
right
time
about
the
new
year
as
we
were
too
to
work
the
ship
take
soundings
the
following
four
seamen
were
engaged
halvorsen
olsen
steller
and
andersen
at
last
we
were
more
or
less
ready
and
the
fram
sailed
from
buenos
aires
on
june
the
anniversary
of
our
leaving
horten
on
our
first
hydrographic
cruise
in
the
north
atlantic
i
suppose
there
was
no
one
on
board
on
june
who
dreamed
that
a
year
later
we
should
go
on
a
similar
cruise
in
the
south
we
had
a
pilot
on
board
as
far
as
montevideo
where
we
arrived
on
the
afternoon
of
the
but
on
account
of
an
increasing
wind
pampero
we
had
to
lie
at
anchor
here
for
a
day
and
a
half
as
the
pilot
could
not
be
taken
off
on
saturday
afternoon
the
he
was
fetched
off
by
a
big
on
board
of
which
was
the
secretary
of
the
norwegian
consulate
this
gentleman
asked
us
if
we
could
not
come
into
the
harbour
as
people
would
like
to
see
the
ship
i
promised
to
come
in
on
the
way
back
if
we
had
time
on
sunday
morning
the
we
weighed
anchor
and
went
out
in
the
most
lovely
weather
that
can
be
imagined
gradually
the
land
disappeared
and
in
the
course
of
the
evening
we
lost
the
lights
we
were
once
more
out
in
the
atlantic
and
immediately
everything
resumed
its
old
course
in
order
to
save
our
supply
of
preserved
provisions
as
much
as
possible
we
took
with
us
a
quantity
of
live
poultry
and
no
fewer
than
twenty
live
sheep
which
were
quartered
in
the
farmyard
on
the
port
side
of
the
vessel
sheep
and
hens
were
all
together
and
there
was
always
a
most
beautiful
scent
of
hay
so
that
we
had
not
only
sea
air
but
country
air
in
spite
of
all
this
delightful
air
three
or
four
of
the
crew
were
down
with
influenza
and
had
to
keep
their
berths
for
some
days
i
reckoned
on
being
back
at
buenos
aires
by
the
beginning
of
september
and
on
getting
if
possible
one
station
a
day
the
distance
according
to
a
rough
calculation
was
about
nautical
miles
and
i
laid
down
the
following
plan
to
go
about
east
by
north
with
the
prevailing
northerly
and
winds
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
there
get
hold
of
the
trade
if
we
could
not
reach
africa
before
that
date
then
to
turn
on
july
and
lay
our
course
with
the
trade
for
helena
which
we
could
reach
before
august
from
there
again
with
the
same
wind
to
south
trinidad
august
or
on
again
with
easterly
and
winds
on
a
course
until
about
august
when
the
observations
were
to
be
concluded
and
we
should
try
to
make
buenos
aires
in
the
shortest
time
that
was
the
plan
that
we
attempted
on
account
of
the
fresh
water
from
the
river
la
plata
we
did
not
begin
at
once
to
take
samples
of
water
and
with
a
we
lay
for
some
days
we
also
had
a
pretty
stiff
breeze
which
was
another
reason
for
delaying
the
soundings
until
the
for
taking
samples
of
water
a
winch
is
used
with
a
of
let
us
say
metres
fathoms
on
which
are
hung
one
or
more
tubes
for
catching
water
we
used
three
at
once
to
save
time
now
supposing
water
and
temperatures
are
to
be
taken
at
depths
of
and
metres
and
fathoms
apparatus
iii
see
diagram
is
first
hung
on
about
metres
fathoms
from
the
end
of
the
line
where
a
small
weight
a
hangs
then
it
is
lowered
until
the
over
which
the
line
passes
shows
metres
fathoms
apparatus
ii
is
then
put
on
and
it
is
lowered
again
for
another
metres
when
apparatus
is
put
on
and
the
line
paid
out
for
metres
fathoms
that
is
until
the
shows
metres
fathoms
the
upper
apparatus
i
is
then
at
metres
fathoms
no
ii
at
metres
fathoms
and
no
iii
at
metres
fathoms
under
apparatus
and
ii
is
hung
a
slipping
sinker
about
centimetres
or
inches
long
and
centimetres
or
inches
in
diameter
to
the
are
attached
thermometers
b
in
tubes
arranged
for
the
purpose
the
themselves
consist
of
a
brass
cylinder
c
about
centimetres
inches
long
and
centimetres
inches
in
diameter
about
half
a
litre
of
water
set
in
a
frame
d
at
about
the
middle
of
the
cylinder
are
pivots
which
rest
in
bearings
on
the
frame
so
that
the
cylinder
can
be
swung
degrees
straight
up
and
down
the
cylinder
while
being
lowered
in
an
inverted
position
is
open
at
both
ends
so
that
the
water
can
pass
through
but
at
its
upper
and
lower
ends
are
valves
working
on
hinges
and
provided
with
packing
when
the
apparatus
is
released
the
cylinder
swings
round
and
these
valves
then
automatically
close
the
ends
of
the
cylinder
the
water
that
is
thus
caught
in
the
cylinder
at
the
required
depth
remains
in
it
while
it
is
being
heaved
up
and
is
collected
in
bottles
when
the
apparatus
is
released
the
column
of
mercury
in
the
thermometer
is
broken
and
the
temperature
of
the
water
is
read
at
the
same
depth
as
the
water
is
taken
from
the
release
takes
place
in
the
following
manner
when
all
the
cylinders
have
been
lowered
to
the
required
depths
they
are
left
hanging
for
a
few
minutes
so
that
the
thermometers
may
be
set
at
the
right
temperature
before
the
column
of
mercury
is
broken
then
a
slipping
sinker
is
sent
down
the
line
when
this
sinker
strikes
the
first
apparatus
a
spring
is
pressed
a
hook
e
which
has
held
the
cylinder
slips
loose
and
the
cylinder
turns
completely
over
apparatus
as
it
does
this
the
valves
as
already
mentioned
close
the
ends
of
the
cylinder
which
is
fixed
in
its
new
position
by
a
hook
in
the
bottom
of
the
frame
at
the
same
instant
the
slipping
sinker
that
hangs
under
apparatus
is
released
and
continues
the
journey
to
apparatus
where
the
same
thing
happens
it
is
then
repeated
with
apparatus
iii
when
they
are
all
ready
they
are
heaved
in
by
holding
one
finger
on
the
line
one
can
feel
at
all
events
in
fairly
calm
weather
when
the
sinkers
strike
against
the
cylinders
but
i
used
to
look
at
my
watch
as
it
takes
about
half
a
minute
for
the
sinker
to
go
down
metres
the
necessary
data
are
entered
in
a
book
on
the
morning
of
the
then
the
sails
were
clewed
up
and
the
fram
began
to
roll
even
worse
than
with
the
sails
set
we
first
tried
taking
soundings
with
a
sinker
of
pounds
and
a
tube
for
taking
specimens
of
the
at
metres
fathoms
or
more
the
line
piano
wire
broke
so
that
sinker
tube
and
over
metres
of
line
continued
their
way
unhindered
to
the
bottom
i
had
thought
of
taking
samples
of
water
at
and
metres
fathoms
and
so
on
and
were
put
on
from
to
metres
this
however
took
six
hours
next
day
on
account
of
the
heavy
sea
only
a
few
samples
from
to
metres
fathoms
were
taken
on
the
third
day
we
made
another
attempt
to
get
the
bottom
this
time
we
got
specimens
of
the
from
about
metres
about
fathoms
but
the
heaving
in
and
taking
of
water
samples
and
temperatures
occupied
eight
hours
from
till
or
a
third
part
of
the
hours
in
this
way
we
should
want
at
least
nine
months
on
the
route
that
had
been
laid
down
but
as
unfortunately
this
time
was
not
at
our
disposal
we
at
once
gave
up
taking
specimens
of
the
bottom
and
samples
of
water
at
greater
depths
than
metres
fathoms
for
the
remainder
of
the
trip
we
took
temperatures
and
samples
of
water
at
the
following
depths
and
metres
and
fathoms
in
all
fifteen
samples
from
each
station
and
from
this
time
forward
we
went
on
regularly
with
one
station
every
day
finally
we
managed
to
heave
up
two
on
the
same
line
by
hand
without
great
difficulty
at
first
this
was
done
with
the
motor
and
but
this
took
too
long
and
we
afterwards
used
nothing
but
a
light
before
very
long
we
were
so
practised
that
the
whole
business
only
took
two
hours
these
two
hours
were
those
we
liked
best
of
the
all
kinds
of
funny
stories
were
told
especially
about
experiences
in
buenos
aires
and
every
day
there
was
something
new
here
is
a
little
yarn
one
of
the
members
of
the
expedition
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
in
one
of
the
busiest
streets
the
car
stopped
and
of
course
a
crowd
collected
at
once
our
friend
lay
there
wondering
whether
he
ought
not
to
be
dead
or
at
least
to
have
broken
a
leg
so
as
to
get
compensation
while
he
lay
thus
being
prodded
and
examined
by
the
public
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
half
a
dollar
in
his
pocket
with
all
that
money
it
did
matter
so
much
about
the
compensation
up
jumped
our
friend
like
an
ball
and
in
a
second
he
had
vanished
in
the
crowd
who
stood
gazing
after
the
dead
man
our
speed
on
this
cruise
was
regulated
as
nearly
as
possible
so
that
there
might
be
about
nautical
miles
between
each
station
and
i
must
say
we
were
uncommonly
lucky
in
the
weather
we
made
two
fairly
parallel
sections
with
comparatively
regular
intervals
between
the
stations
as
regular
in
any
case
as
one
can
hope
to
get
with
a
vessel
like
the
fram
which
really
has
too
little
both
of
sail
area
and
engine
power
the
number
of
stations
was
in
all
and
samples
of
water
were
taken
of
plankton
specimens
were
sent
home
the
further
examination
of
these
specimens
in
norway
will
show
whether
the
material
collected
is
of
any
value
and
whether
the
cruise
has
yielded
satisfactory
results
as
regards
the
weather
on
the
trip
it
was
uniformly
good
the
whole
time
we
had
a
good
deal
of
wind
now
and
then
with
seas
and
rolling
but
for
the
most
part
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
in
the
trade
we
sailed
for
four
weeks
at
a
stretch
without
using
the
engine
which
then
had
a
thorough
overhauling
at
the
same
time
we
had
a
good
opportunity
of
smartening
up
the
ship
which
she
needed
badly
all
the
iron
was
freed
from
rust
and
the
whole
vessel
painted
both
below
and
above
deck
the
decks
themselves
were
smeared
with
a
mixture
of
oil
tar
and
turpentine
after
being
scoured
all
the
rigging
was
examined
at
the
anchorage
at
buenos
aires
nearly
the
whole
ship
was
painted
again
masts
and
yards
the
outside
of
the
vessel
and
everything
inboard
both
the
boats
and
the
various
winches
pumps
etc
in
the
everything
was
either
shining
bright
or
freshly
painted
everything
hung
in
its
place
and
such
order
and
cleanliness
reigned
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
go
down
there
the
result
of
all
this
renovating
and
smartening
up
was
that
when
we
fetched
up
by
the
quay
at
buenos
aires
the
fram
looked
brighter
than
i
suppose
she
has
ever
done
since
she
was
new
during
the
trip
the
holds
were
also
cleaned
up
and
all
the
provisions
and
an
inventory
made
of
them
a
whole
suit
of
sails
was
completely
worn
out
on
this
voyage
but
what
can
one
expect
when
the
ship
is
being
worked
every
single
day
with
clewing
up
making
fast
and
setting
of
sails
both
in
calms
and
winds
this
work
every
day
reminded
me
of
the
corvette
ellida
when
the
order
was
all
hands
aloft
as
a
rule
though
it
was
only
clewing
up
the
sails
that
had
to
be
done
as
we
always
had
to
take
soundings
on
the
weather
side
so
that
the
should
not
foul
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
and
smash
the
apparatus
and
we
did
not
lose
more
than
one
thermometer
in
about
nine
hundred
soundings
on
account
of
all
this
wear
and
tear
of
sails
rönne
was
occupied
the
whole
time
both
at
sea
and
in
buenos
aires
in
making
and
patching
sails
as
there
was
not
much
more
than
the
leeches
left
of
those
that
had
been
used
and
on
the
approaching
trip
to
the
ice
barrier
we
should
have
to
have
absolutely
things
in
the
roaring
forties
june
is
a
day
in
the
fram
history
as
on
that
day
we
intersected
our
course
from
norway
to
the
barrier
and
the
franz
thus
completed
her
first
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
bravo
fram
it
was
well
done
especially
after
the
bad
character
you
have
been
given
as
a
sailer
and
a
in
honour
of
the
occasion
we
had
a
better
dinner
than
usual
and
the
franz
was
congratulated
by
all
present
on
having
done
her
work
well
on
the
evening
of
july
helena
was
passed
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
this
historic
island
it
was
very
strange
to
think
that
the
greatest
spirit
of
a
hundred
centuries
as
some
author
has
called
napoleon
should
have
ending
his
restless
life
on
this
lonely
island
of
the
south
atlantic
on
august
when
daylight
came
we
sighted
the
little
martin
vaz
islands
ahead
and
a
little
later
south
trinidad
in
this
island
was
passed
on
october
we
checked
our
chronometers
which
however
proved
to
be
correct
from
noon
till
while
we
were
lying
still
and
taking
our
daily
hydrographic
observations
a
sailing
ship
appeared
to
the
north
of
us
lying
to
the
south
she
bore
down
on
us
and
ran
up
her
flag
and
we
exchanged
the
usual
greetings
she
was
a
norwegian
barque
bound
for
australia
otherwise
we
did
not
see
more
than
four
or
five
ships
on
the
whole
voyage
and
those
were
pretty
far
off
never
since
leaving
madeira
september
had
we
been
troubled
with
animals
or
insects
of
any
kind
whatever
but
when
we
were
in
buenos
aires
for
the
first
time
at
least
half
a
million
flies
came
aboard
to
look
at
the
vessel
i
hoped
they
would
go
ashore
when
the
fram
sailed
but
no
they
followed
us
until
by
degrees
they
passed
peacefully
away
on
well
flies
are
one
thing
but
we
had
something
else
that
was
worse
namely
rats
our
horror
and
dread
and
for
the
future
our
deadly
enemies
the
first
signs
of
them
i
found
in
my
bunk
and
on
the
table
in
the
they
were
certainly
not
particular
what
i
said
on
that
occasion
had
better
not
be
printed
though
no
expression
could
be
strong
enough
to
give
vent
to
one
annoyance
at
such
a
discovery
we
set
traps
but
what
was
the
use
of
that
when
the
cargo
consisted
exclusively
of
provisions
one
morning
as
rönne
was
sitting
at
work
making
sails
he
observed
a
shadow
flying
past
his
feet
and
according
to
his
account
into
the
the
cook
came
roaring
there
a
rat
in
the
then
there
was
a
lively
scene
the
door
was
shut
and
all
hands
started
hunting
all
the
cabins
were
emptied
and
rummaged
the
piano
too
everything
was
turned
upside
down
but
the
rat
had
vanished
into
thin
air
about
a
fortnight
later
i
noticed
a
smell
in
cabin
which
was
empty
on
closer
sniffing
and
examination
it
turned
out
to
be
the
dead
rat
a
big
black
one
unfortunately
a
male
rat
the
poor
brute
that
had
starved
to
death
had
tried
to
keep
itself
alive
by
devouring
a
couple
of
novels
that
lay
in
a
locked
drawer
how
the
rat
got
into
that
drawer
beats
me
on
cleaning
out
the
provision
hold
nests
were
found
with
several
rats
in
them
six
were
killed
but
at
least
as
many
escaped
so
now
no
doubt
we
have
a
whole
colony
a
reward
was
promised
of
ten
cigars
for
each
rat
traps
were
tried
again
but
all
this
did
very
little
good
when
we
were
in
buenos
aires
for
the
second
time
we
got
a
cat
on
board
it
certainly
kept
the
rats
down
but
it
was
shot
on
the
barrier
at
hobart
we
provided
a
few
traps
which
caught
a
good
many
but
we
shall
hardly
get
rid
of
them
altogether
until
we
have
landed
most
of
the
provisions
and
smoked
them
out
we
have
also
had
a
lot
of
moth
at
present
they
have
done
nothing
beyond
eating
a
couple
of
holes
in
my
best
trousers
during
the
whole
of
this
cruise
we
had
a
hanging
out
but
it
hung
for
a
whole
month
without
there
being
a
sign
of
a
fish
in
spite
of
the
most
delicate
little
white
rag
that
was
attached
to
the
hook
one
morning
the
keenest
of
our
fishermen
came
up
as
usual
and
felt
the
line
yes
by
jove
at
last
there
was
one
and
a
big
one
too
as
he
could
hardly
haul
in
the
line
by
himself
there
was
a
shout
for
assistance
hi
you
beggar
come
and
lend
a
hand
there
a
big
fish
help
came
in
a
second
and
they
both
hauled
for
all
they
were
worth
ah
he
a
fine
glistening
fish
it
be
grand
to
get
fresh
fish
for
dinner
at
last
the
fish
appeared
over
the
rail
but
alas
it
was
seen
to
have
no
head
it
was
an
ordinary
stockfish
about
of
a
yard
long
that
some
joker
had
hung
on
the
line
during
the
night
that
we
all
had
a
hearty
laugh
goes
without
saying
the
fishermen
included
as
they
took
it
all
in
good
part
as
a
the
fram
is
on
the
whole
not
very
successful
the
only
fish
we
caught
besides
the
stockfish
was
a
real
live
fish
but
unfortunately
it
fell
off
the
hook
as
it
was
being
hauled
in
according
to
the
account
of
this
fish
was
six
feet
long
and
one
broad
now
we
do
fish
any
more
on
august
the
hydrographic
observations
were
brought
to
an
end
and
a
course
was
laid
for
buenos
aires
where
we
anchored
in
the
roads
at
midnight
on
september
at
buenos
aires
to
arrive
at
buenos
aires
in
the
early
part
of
was
not
an
unmixed
pleasure
especially
when
one
had
no
money
the
fram
expedition
was
apparently
not
very
popular
at
that
time
and
our
cash
balance
amounted
to
about
forty
pesos
about
l
but
that
would
not
go
very
far
our
supply
of
provisions
had
shrunk
to
almost
nothing
and
we
had
not
enough
to
be
able
to
leave
the
port
i
had
been
told
that
a
sum
had
been
placed
to
the
credit
of
the
fram
for
our
stay
in
buenos
aires
but
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
of
it
while
we
were
there
and
it
was
no
doubt
somewhat
imaginary
if
we
were
to
be
at
all
able
to
go
down
and
take
off
the
shore
party
money
must
be
found
we
had
come
to
the
end
of
and
ropes
we
had
too
little
food
and
a
minimum
of
oil
all
this
would
have
to
be
provided
at
the
worst
the
oceanographical
cruise
could
be
cut
out
and
we
could
lie
still
at
buenos
aires
then
as
our
comrades
could
not
very
well
be
left
to
perish
on
the
ice
enough
would
have
to
be
sent
us
from
norway
to
enable
us
to
go
down
there
but
that
would
finish
the
whole
expedition
as
in
such
a
case
the
fram
had
orders
to
go
back
to
norway
as
usual
however
the
fram
luck
helped
her
again
a
few
days
before
we
left
norway
our
distinguished
compatriot
in
buenos
aires
don
pedro
christophersen
had
cabled
that
he
would
supply
us
with
what
provisions
we
might
require
if
after
leaving
madeira
we
would
call
at
buenos
aires
of
course
he
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
the
voyage
would
be
extended
to
include
the
south
pole
and
that
the
fram
on
arrival
at
buenos
aires
would
be
almost
empty
instead
of
having
a
full
cargo
but
that
did
not
prevent
his
helping
us
i
immediately
called
on
him
and
his
brother
the
norwegian
minister
fortunately
they
were
both
very
enthusiastic
about
our
chief
change
of
plan
when
on
a
subsequent
occasion
i
expressed
my
astonishment
at
not
hearing
from
home
i
was
told
that
the
funds
of
the
expedition
were
exhausted
and
christophersen
promised
me
on
hearing
what
straits
we
were
in
to
pay
all
our
expenses
in
buenos
aires
and
to
supply
us
with
provisions
and
fuel
that
brought
us
out
of
our
difficulties
at
a
bound
and
we
had
no
more
need
to
take
thought
for
the
morrow
everyone
on
board
received
a
sum
of
money
for
his
personal
expenses
from
the
norwegian
colony
of
the
river
plate
and
we
were
invited
to
their
dinner
on
independence
day
may
our
second
stay
at
buenos
aires
was
very
pleasant
everyone
was
amiability
itself
and
festivities
were
even
got
up
for
us
we
took
on
board
provisions
that
had
been
sent
out
from
norway
by
christophersen
orders
about
litres
gallons
of
petroleum
ship
stores
and
so
on
enough
for
a
year
but
this
was
not
all
just
before
we
sailed
christophersen
said
he
would
send
a
relief
expedition
if
the
fram
did
not
return
to
australia
by
a
certain
date
but
as
everyone
knows
this
was
happily
unnecessary
during
the
three
weeks
we
were
lying
at
the
quay
in
buenos
aires
we
were
occupied
in
getting
everything
on
board
and
making
the
vessel
ready
for
sea
we
had
finished
this
by
the
afternoon
of
wednesday
october
and
next
morning
the
pram
was
ready
to
continue
her
second
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
in
buenos
aires
we
lay
at
the
same
quay
as
the
deutschland
the
german
antarctic
expedition
ship
kutschin
and
the
second
engineer
nödtvedt
went
home
and
seaman
andersen
was
discharged
from
buenos
aires
to
the
ross
barrier
on
the
trip
from
buenos
aires
to
the
barrier
the
watches
were
divided
as
follows
from
eight
to
two
nilsen
hansen
halvorsen
and
olsen
from
two
to
eight
gjertsen
beck
rönne
and
steller
in
the
sundbeck
and
kristensen
lastly
olsen
cook
in
all
eleven
men
it
is
said
that
well
begun
is
half
done
and
it
almost
seems
as
if
a
bad
beginning
were
likely
to
have
a
similar
continuation
when
we
left
the
northern
basin
on
the
morning
of
october
there
was
a
head
wind
and
it
was
not
till
hours
later
that
we
could
drop
the
pilot
at
the
recalada
lightship
after
a
time
it
fell
calm
and
we
made
small
progress
down
the
river
la
plata
until
on
the
night
of
the
we
were
clear
of
the
land
and
the
lights
disappeared
on
the
horizon
properly
speaking
we
ought
to
have
been
in
the
west
wind
belt
as
soon
as
we
came
out
and
the
drift
of
the
clouds
and
movement
of
the
barograph
were
examined
at
least
times
a
day
but
it
still
remained
calm
at
last
after
the
lapse
of
several
days
we
had
a
little
fresh
wind
with
hail
showers
and
then
of
course
i
thought
we
had
made
a
beginning
but
unfortunately
it
only
lasted
a
night
so
that
our
joy
was
we
took
with
us
from
buenos
aires
fifteen
live
sheep
and
fifteen
live
little
pigs
for
which
two
houses
were
built
on
the
as
however
one
of
the
pigs
was
found
dead
on
the
morning
after
the
breeze
just
mentioned
i
assumed
that
this
was
on
account
of
the
cold
and
another
house
was
at
once
built
for
them
between
decks
in
the
where
it
was
very
warm
they
were
down
here
the
whole
time
but
as
their
house
was
cleaned
out
twice
a
day
and
dry
straw
put
on
the
floor
they
did
not
cause
us
much
inconvenience
besides
which
their
house
was
raised
more
than
half
a
foot
above
the
deck
itself
so
that
the
space
below
could
always
be
kept
clean
the
pigs
thrived
so
well
down
here
that
we
could
almost
see
them
growing
on
arrival
at
the
barrier
we
had
no
fewer
than
nine
alive
the
sheep
had
a
house
with
a
tarpaulin
over
the
roof
and
they
grew
fatter
and
fatter
we
had
every
opportunity
of
noticing
this
as
we
killed
one
of
them
regularly
every
saturday
until
we
came
into
the
and
got
we
had
four
sheep
left
on
reaching
the
barrier
we
did
wretchedly
in
october
calms
and
east
winds
nothing
but
east
winds
as
regards
distance
it
was
the
worst
month
we
had
had
since
leaving
norway
notwithstanding
that
the
fram
had
been
in
dry
dock
had
a
clean
bottom
and
a
light
cargo
when
with
any
head
sea
we
scarcely
move
a
stiff
fair
wind
is
what
is
wanted
if
we
are
to
get
on
somebody
said
we
got
on
so
badly
because
we
had
thirteen
pigs
on
board
another
said
it
was
because
we
caught
so
many
birds
and
i
had
caught
no
less
than
fourteen
albatrosses
and
four
cape
pigeons
altogether
there
is
quite
enough
of
what
i
will
call
superstition
at
sea
one
particular
bird
brings
fine
weather
another
storms
it
is
very
important
to
notice
which
way
the
whale
swims
or
the
dolphin
leaps
the
success
of
depends
on
whether
the
first
seal
is
seen
ahead
or
astern
and
so
on
enough
of
that
october
went
out
and
november
came
in
with
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
so
that
we
did
nine
and
a
half
knots
this
promised
well
for
november
but
the
promise
was
scarcely
fulfilled
we
had
northerly
wind
or
southerly
wind
continually
generally
a
little
to
the
east
of
north
or
south
and
i
believe
i
am
not
saying
too
much
when
i
state
that
in
the
west
wind
belt
with
an
easterly
course
we
lay
on
one
tack
or
the
other
for
about
of
the
way
for
only
three
days
out
of
three
months
did
we
have
a
real
west
wind
a
wind
which
with
and
winds
i
had
reckoned
on
having
for
per
cent
of
the
trip
from
buenos
aires
to
about
the
longitude
of
tasmania
in
my
enthusiasm
over
the
west
wind
in
question
i
went
so
far
as
to
write
in
my
diary
at
on
november
there
is
a
gale
from
the
west
and
we
are
making
nine
knots
with
foresail
and
topsail
the
sea
is
pretty
high
and
breaking
on
both
sides
of
the
vessel
so
that
everything
about
us
is
a
mass
of
spray
in
spite
of
this
not
a
drop
of
water
comes
on
deck
and
it
is
so
dry
that
the
watch
are
going
about
in
clogs
for
my
part
i
am
wearing
felt
slippers
which
will
not
stand
wet
and
oilskins
hang
ready
in
the
in
case
it
should
rain
on
a
watch
like
when
the
moon
is
kind
enough
to
shine
everyone
on
deck
is
in
the
best
of
humours
whistling
chattering
and
singing
somebody
comes
up
with
the
remark
that
took
that
sea
finely
or
she
flying
properly
is
almost
too
feeble
an
expression
one
ought
to
say
and
when
speaking
of
the
fram
what
more
can
one
wish
etc
but
whatever
time
adam
may
have
spent
in
paradise
we
were
not
there
more
than
three
days
and
then
the
same
wretched
state
of
things
began
again
what
i
wrote
when
there
was
a
head
wind
or
calm
i
should
be
sorry
to
reproduce
woe
to
him
who
then
came
and
said
it
was
fine
weather
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
the
fram
sails
so
much
more
easily
now
than
in
otherwise
we
should
have
taken
six
months
to
reach
the
barrier
when
we
had
wind
we
used
it
to
the
utmost
but
we
did
not
do
this
without
the
loss
of
one
or
two
things
the
new
broke
a
couple
of
times
and
one
night
we
carried
away
the
outer
bobstay
of
the
the
foresail
and
topsail
were
neither
made
fast
nor
reefed
during
the
whole
trip
the
last
time
the
broke
there
was
a
strong
breeze
from
the
with
a
heavy
sea
all
sail
was
set
with
the
exception
of
the
spanker
as
the
ship
would
not
steer
with
that
there
was
an
extra
preventer
on
the
double
but
in
spite
of
that
the
sheets
broke
and
the
jib
was
split
with
a
fearful
crack
within
a
minute
the
mainsail
and
were
hauled
down
so
that
the
ship
might
fall
off
and
the
jib
hauled
down
this
was
instantly
unbent
and
a
new
one
bent
the
man
at
the
helm
of
course
got
the
blame
for
this
and
the
first
thing
he
said
to
me
was
i
could
help
it
she
was
twisting
on
the
top
of
a
wave
we
were
then
making
ten
knots
and
more
than
that
we
shall
not
do
the
fram
rolled
well
that
day
a
little
earlier
in
the
afternoon
at
two
when
the
watch
had
gone
below
to
dinner
and
were
just
eating
the
sweet
which
on
that
occasion
consisted
of
preserved
pears
we
felt
that
there
was
an
unusually
big
lurch
coming
although
of
course
we
had
fiddles
on
the
table
the
plates
with
meat
potatoes
jumped
over
the
fiddles
which
they
did
care
a
button
for
into
beck
cabin
i
caught
one
of
the
pears
in
its
flight
but
the
plate
with
the
rest
of
them
went
on
its
way
of
course
there
was
a
great
shout
of
laughter
which
stopped
dead
as
we
heard
a
violent
noise
on
deck
over
our
heads
i
guessed
at
once
it
was
an
empty
that
had
broken
loose
and
with
my
mouth
full
of
pear
i
yelled
tank
and
flew
on
deck
with
the
whole
watch
below
at
my
heels
a
sea
had
come
in
over
the
and
had
lifted
the
tank
up
from
its
lashings
all
hands
threw
themselves
upon
the
tank
and
held
on
to
it
till
the
water
had
poured
off
the
deck
when
it
was
again
fixed
in
its
place
when
this
was
done
my
watch
went
below
again
and
lit
their
pipes
as
if
nothing
had
happened
on
november
we
passed
the
northernmost
of
the
prince
edward
islands
and
on
the
close
to
penguin
island
the
most
of
the
crozets
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
latter
we
saw
a
great
quantity
of
birds
a
number
of
seals
and
penguins
and
even
a
little
iceberg
i
went
close
to
the
land
to
check
the
chronometers
which
an
observation
and
bearings
of
the
islands
showed
to
be
correct
our
course
was
then
laid
for
kerguelen
island
but
we
went
too
far
north
to
see
it
as
for
two
weeks
the
wind
was
and
southerly
and
the
leeway
we
made
when
sailing
took
us
every
day
a
little
to
the
north
of
east
when
we
were
in
the
same
waters
in
there
was
gale
after
gale
then
we
did
not
put
in
at
kerguelen
on
account
of
the
force
of
the
wind
this
time
we
could
not
approach
the
island
because
of
the
wind
direction
in
no
respect
can
the
second
trip
be
compared
with
the
first
i
should
never
have
dreamed
that
there
could
be
so
much
difference
in
the
roaring
forties
in
two
different
years
at
the
same
season
in
the
foggy
fifties
the
weather
was
calm
and
fine
and
we
had
no
fog
until
lat
as
regards
the
distance
sailed
november
is
the
best
month
the
fram
has
had
in
december
which
began
with
a
speed
of
one
and
a
half
knots
calm
swell
against
us
and
the
engine
at
full
speed
we
had
a
fair
wind
for
three
days
all
the
rest
calms
and
head
winds
the
first
part
of
the
month
from
the
and
east
so
that
we
came
much
too
far
south
even
in
long
we
were
in
lat
in
christmas
week
we
had
calms
and
light
winds
from
the
so
that
we
managed
to
steal
eastward
to
long
and
lat
where
on
the
edge
of
the
we
had
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
that
is
straight
on
to
the
ice
between
buenos
aires
and
the
we
caught
as
i
have
said
a
good
many
birds
mostly
albatrosses
and
about
thirty
skins
were
prepared
by
hansen
the
largest
albatross
we
got
measured
twelve
feet
between
the
tips
of
its
wings
and
the
smallest
bird
was
of
a
land
species
not
much
bigger
than
a
talking
of
albatrosses
it
is
both
amusing
and
interesting
to
watch
their
elegant
flight
in
a
high
wind
without
a
movement
of
the
wings
they
sail
now
with
now
against
the
wind
at
one
instant
they
touch
the
surface
of
the
water
with
the
points
of
their
wings
at
the
next
they
go
straight
into
the
air
like
an
arrow
an
interesting
and
instructive
study
for
an
aviator
in
a
wind
when
there
is
generally
a
number
of
them
hovering
about
the
vessel
they
will
dash
down
after
anything
that
is
thrown
overboard
but
of
course
it
is
useless
to
try
to
catch
them
when
the
ship
has
so
much
way
this
must
be
done
the
next
day
when
the
wind
is
lighter
the
birds
are
caught
with
an
iron
triangle
which
ought
to
be
enclosed
in
wood
so
that
it
will
float
on
the
water
at
the
apex
which
is
very
acute
the
iron
is
filed
as
sharp
as
a
knife
and
pork
is
hung
on
each
of
the
sides
when
this
is
thrown
in
the
wake
of
the
ship
the
bird
settles
on
the
water
to
feed
the
upper
part
of
its
beak
is
hooked
like
that
of
a
bird
of
prey
and
as
the
albatross
opens
its
beak
and
bites
at
the
pork
you
give
a
jerk
so
that
the
triangle
catches
the
upper
part
of
the
beak
by
two
small
notches
and
the
bird
is
left
hanging
if
the
line
should
break
the
whole
thing
simply
falls
off
and
the
bird
is
unharmed
in
hauling
in
therefore
you
have
to
be
very
careful
to
hold
the
line
quite
tight
even
if
the
bird
flies
towards
you
otherwise
it
will
easily
fall
off
a
bird
may
be
pulled
in
several
times
and
will
immediately
take
the
bait
again
on
the
night
of
december
an
unusually
beautiful
aurora
was
seen
it
lasted
over
an
hour
and
moved
in
a
direction
from
west
to
east
on
the
all
the
white
paint
was
washed
the
temperature
was
and
we
were
in
for
a
whole
week
before
christmas
the
cook
was
busy
baking
christmas
cakes
i
am
bound
to
say
he
is
industrious
and
the
day
before
christmas
eve
one
of
the
little
pigs
named
tulla
was
killed
the
swineherd
olsen
whose
special
favourite
this
pig
was
had
to
keep
away
during
the
operation
that
we
might
not
witness
his
emotion
early
on
the
morning
of
christmas
eve
we
saw
the
three
first
icebergs
there
was
an
absolute
calm
all
day
with
misty
air
to
keep
christmas
the
engine
was
stopped
at
and
then
all
hands
came
to
dinner
unfortunately
we
had
no
gramophone
to
sing
to
us
as
in
as
a
substitute
the
orchestra
played
glade
jul
hellige
jul
when
all
were
seated
the
orchestra
was
composed
of
beck
on
the
violin
sundbeck
on
the
mandolin
and
the
undersigned
on
the
flute
i
puffed
out
my
cheeks
as
much
as
i
could
and
that
is
not
saying
a
little
so
that
the
others
might
see
how
proficient
i
was
i
hardly
think
it
was
much
of
a
musical
treat
but
the
public
was
neither
critical
nor
ceremonious
and
the
prevalent
costume
was
jerseys
the
dinner
consisted
of
soup
roast
pork
with
fresh
potatoes
and
whortleberries
aquavit
and
norwegian
bock
beer
followed
by
and
kransekake
with
champagne
the
toasts
of
their
majesties
the
king
and
queen
don
pedro
christophersen
captain
amundsen
and
the
fram
were
drunk
i
had
decorated
the
saloon
in
a
small
way
with
artificial
flowers
embroideries
and
flags
to
give
a
little
colour
dinner
was
followed
by
cigars
and
the
distribution
of
christmas
presents
hansen
played
the
accordion
and
lieutenant
gjertsen
and
rönne
danced
folk
dances
the
latter
was
as
usual
so
amusing
that
he
kept
us
in
fits
of
laughter
at
ten
it
was
all
over
the
engine
was
started
again
one
watch
went
to
bed
and
the
other
on
deck
olsen
cleaned
out
the
pigsty
as
usual
at
this
time
of
night
that
finished
christmas
for
this
year
as
has
been
said
before
sir
james
ross
was
down
here
in
the
two
years
in
succession
he
sailed
from
the
pacific
into
ross
sea
with
two
ships
that
had
no
auxiliary
i
assumed
therefore
that
if
he
could
get
through
so
easily
there
must
be
some
place
between
south
victoria
land
and
the
barrier
or
land
on
the
other
side
where
there
was
little
or
no
ice
following
this
assumption
i
intended
to
go
down
to
the
western
that
lying
off
south
victoria
land
and
steer
along
it
till
we
were
in
ross
sea
or
at
all
events
until
we
found
a
place
where
we
could
easily
get
through
it
is
quite
possible
that
ross
was
very
lucky
in
the
time
at
which
he
encountered
the
ice
and
that
he
only
sailed
in
clear
weather
we
had
no
time
to
spare
however
but
had
to
make
use
of
whatever
wind
there
was
even
if
we
could
not
see
very
far
as
early
as
december
at
in
lat
and
long
it
was
reported
that
we
were
off
the
pack
i
was
a
good
deal
surprised
as
recent
expeditions
had
not
met
the
pack
until
or
about
one
hundred
nautical
miles
farther
south
nor
had
there
been
any
sign
of
our
being
so
near
the
ice
the
wind
for
the
last
few
days
had
been
but
for
the
moment
it
was
calm
we
therefore
held
on
to
the
east
along
the
edge
of
the
pack
with
the
ice
to
starboard
about
midnight
the
wind
freshened
from
the
north
and
we
lay
along
the
edge
of
the
ice
till
midday
on
the
when
the
direction
of
the
ice
became
more
southerly
the
northerly
wind
which
gradually
increased
to
a
stiff
breeze
was
good
enough
for
getting
us
on
but
it
must
inevitably
bring
fog
and
snow
in
its
train
these
came
sure
enough
as
thick
as
a
wall
and
for
a
couple
of
days
we
sailed
perfectly
blindly
outside
the
proper
lie
long
streams
of
floes
and
loose
scattered
lumps
which
become
more
frequent
as
one
nears
the
pack
for
two
days
we
sailed
simply
by
the
lumps
of
ice
the
more
of
them
we
saw
the
more
easterly
was
our
course
until
they
began
to
decrease
when
we
steered
more
to
the
south
in
this
way
we
went
in
hours
from
lat
and
long
to
lat
and
long
a
distance
of
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
nautical
miles
without
entering
the
pack
once
we
very
nearly
went
into
the
trap
but
fortunately
got
out
again
the
wind
was
so
fresh
that
we
did
as
much
as
eight
and
a
half
knots
when
sailing
at
such
a
rate
through
a
loose
stream
of
ice
we
sometimes
ran
upon
a
floe
which
went
under
the
ship
bottom
and
came
up
alongside
the
other
way
up
during
the
afternoon
of
the
the
streams
of
ice
became
closer
and
closer
and
then
i
made
the
mistake
of
continuing
to
sail
to
the
eastward
instead
of
this
i
ought
to
have
stood
off
and
steered
due
south
or
to
the
west
of
south
with
this
ice
on
ourport
side
the
farther
we
advanced
the
more
certain
i
was
that
we
had
come
into
the
eastern
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
owing
to
fog
and
thick
snow
we
had
seen
nothing
for
over
two
days
observations
there
were
none
of
course
our
speed
had
varied
between
two
and
eight
and
a
half
knots
and
we
had
steered
all
manner
of
courses
that
our
dead
reckoning
was
not
very
correct
in
such
circumstances
goes
without
saying
and
an
observation
on
january
showed
us
that
we
were
somewhat
farther
to
the
east
than
we
had
reckoned
on
the
evening
of
december
the
fog
lifted
for
a
while
and
we
saw
nothing
but
ice
all
round
our
course
was
then
set
due
south
we
had
come
right
down
in
lat
and
i
hoped
soon
to
be
clear
altogether
in
we
got
out
of
the
ice
in
and
were
then
in
the
same
longitude
as
now
now
indeed
our
progress
began
to
be
slow
and
the
old
year
went
out
in
a
far
from
pleasant
fashion
the
fog
was
so
thick
that
i
may
safely
say
we
did
not
see
more
than
fifty
yards
from
the
ship
whereas
we
ought
to
have
had
the
midnight
sun
ice
and
were
so
thick
that
at
times
we
lay
still
the
wind
had
unfortunately
fallen
off
but
we
still
had
a
little
breeze
from
the
north
so
that
both
sails
and
engine
could
be
used
we
went
simply
at
haphazard
now
and
then
we
were
lucky
enough
to
come
into
great
open
channels
and
even
lakes
but
then
the
ice
closed
again
absolutely
tight
it
could
hardly
be
called
real
ice
however
but
was
rather
a
about
two
feet
thick
and
as
tough
as
dough
it
looked
as
if
it
had
all
just
been
broken
off
a
single
thick
mass
the
floes
lay
close
together
and
we
could
see
how
one
floe
fitted
into
the
other
the
ice
remained
more
or
less
close
until
we
were
right
down
in
lat
and
long
the
last
part
of
it
was
old
from
here
to
the
bay
of
whales
we
saw
a
few
scattered
streams
of
floes
and
some
icebergs
a
few
seals
were
shot
in
the
ice
so
that
we
had
fresh
meat
enough
and
could
save
the
sheep
and
pigs
until
the
shore
party
came
on
board
i
was
sure
they
would
appreciate
fresh
roast
pork
the
chart
of
ross
sea
has
been
drawn
chiefly
as
a
guide
to
future
expeditions
it
may
be
taken
as
certain
that
the
best
place
to
go
through
the
ice
is
between
long
and
and
that
the
best
time
is
about
the
beginning
of
february
take
for
instance
our
southward
route
in
as
has
been
said
the
ice
was
met
with
as
early
as
in
and
we
were
not
clear
of
it
till
about
between
and
the
line
is
interrupted
and
it
was
there
that
i
ought
to
have
steered
to
the
south
now
follow
the
course
from
the
bay
of
whales
in
only
in
about
was
ice
seen
almost
as
in
and
we
followed
it
after
that
time
we
saw
absolutely
no
more
ice
as
the
chart
shows
therefore
in
the
course
of
about
a
month
and
a
half
all
the
ice
that
we
met
when
going
south
had
drifted
out
the
stippled
line
shows
how
i
assume
the
ice
to
have
lain
the
heavy
broken
line
shows
what
our
course
ought
to
have
been
the
midnight
sun
was
not
seen
till
the
night
of
january
to
the
south
of
lat
it
was
already
above
the
horizon
on
the
night
of
january
we
arrived
off
the
barrier
in
extremely
bitter
weather
and
southerly
winds
had
held
for
a
few
days
with
fair
weather
but
that
night
there
was
thick
snow
and
the
wind
gradually
fell
calm
after
which
a
fresh
breeze
sprang
up
from
the
with
biting
snow
and
at
the
same
time
a
lot
of
the
engine
went
very
slowly
and
the
ship
kept
head
to
wind
about
midnight
the
weather
cleared
a
little
and
a
dark
line
which
proved
to
be
the
barrier
came
in
sight
the
engine
went
ahead
at
full
speed
and
the
sails
were
set
so
that
we
might
get
under
the
lee
of
the
perpendicular
wall
by
degrees
the
above
the
barrier
became
lighter
and
lighter
and
before
very
long
we
were
so
close
under
it
that
we
only
just
had
room
to
go
about
the
barrier
here
runs
east
and
west
and
with
a
wind
we
went
along
it
to
the
east
the
watch
that
had
gone
below
at
eight
when
we
were
still
in
open
sea
came
up
again
at
two
to
find
us
close
to
the
wall
of
ice
some
hours
passed
in
the
same
way
but
then
of
course
the
wind
became
easterly
dead
ahead
so
that
we
had
tack
after
tack
till
the
same
day
when
we
were
at
the
western
point
of
the
bay
of
whales
the
ice
lay
right
out
to
west
cape
and
we
sailed
across
the
mouth
of
the
bay
and
up
under
the
lee
of
the
eastern
barrier
in
order
if
possible
to
find
slack
ice
or
open
water
but
no
the
fast
ice
came
just
as
far
on
that
side
it
turned
out
that
we
could
not
get
farther
south
than
that
is
eleven
nautical
miles
farther
north
than
the
previous
year
and
no
less
than
fifteen
nautical
miles
from
framheim
taking
into
consideration
the
turn
in
the
bay
we
were
thus
back
at
the
same
place
we
had
left
on
february
and
had
since
been
round
the
world
the
distance
covered
on
this
voyage
of
circumnavigation
was
nautical
miles
of
which
belong
to
the
oceanographical
cruise
in
the
south
atlantic
we
did
not
lie
under
the
lee
of
the
eastern
barrier
for
more
than
four
hours
the
wind
which
had
so
often
been
against
us
was
true
to
its
principles
to
the
last
of
course
it
went
to
the
north
and
blew
right
up
the
bay
the
from
ross
sea
came
in
and
at
midnight
january
we
stood
out
again
i
had
thought
of
sending
a
man
up
to
framheim
to
report
that
we
had
arrived
but
the
state
of
the
weather
did
not
allow
it
besides
i
had
only
one
pair
of
private
ski
on
board
and
should
therefore
only
have
been
able
to
send
one
man
it
would
have
been
better
if
several
had
gone
together
during
the
forenoon
of
the
it
gradually
cleared
the
wind
fell
light
and
we
stood
inshore
again
as
at
the
same
time
the
barometer
was
rising
steadily
lieutenant
gjertsen
went
ashore
on
ski
about
one
later
in
the
afternoon
a
dog
came
running
out
across
the
and
i
thought
it
had
come
down
on
lieutenant
gjertsen
track
but
i
was
afterwards
told
it
was
one
of
the
dogs
that
ran
about
on
the
ice
and
did
not
show
themselves
up
at
the
hut
meanwhile
the
wind
freshened
again
we
had
to
put
out
for
another
hours
and
lay
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
with
shortened
sail
then
there
was
fine
weather
again
and
we
came
in
at
on
the
lieutenant
gjertsen
returned
with
lieutenant
prestrud
johansen
and
stubberud
of
course
we
were
very
glad
to
see
one
another
again
and
all
sorts
of
questions
were
asked
on
both
sides
the
chief
and
the
southern
party
were
not
yet
back
they
stayed
on
board
till
the
got
their
letters
and
a
big
pile
of
newspapers
and
went
ashore
again
we
followed
them
with
the
glasses
as
far
as
possible
so
as
to
take
them
on
board
again
if
they
could
not
get
across
the
cracks
in
the
ice
during
the
days
that
followed
we
lay
moored
to
the
ice
or
went
out
according
to
the
weather
at
on
the
we
were
somewhat
surprised
to
see
a
vessel
bearing
down
for
my
part
i
guessed
her
to
be
the
aurora
ship
she
came
very
slowly
but
at
last
what
should
we
see
but
the
japanese
flag
i
had
no
idea
that
expedition
was
out
again
the
ship
came
right
in
went
past
us
twice
and
moored
alongside
the
loose
ice
immediately
afterwards
ten
men
armed
with
picks
and
shovels
went
up
the
barrier
while
the
rest
rushed
wildly
about
after
penguins
and
their
shots
were
heard
all
night
next
morning
the
commander
of
the
kainan
maru
whose
name
was
homura
came
on
board
the
same
day
a
tent
was
set
up
on
the
edge
of
the
barrier
and
cases
sledges
and
so
on
were
put
out
on
the
ice
kainan
maru
means
i
have
been
told
the
ship
that
opens
the
south
prestrud
and
i
went
on
board
her
later
in
the
day
to
see
what
she
was
like
but
we
met
neither
the
leader
of
the
expedition
nor
the
captain
of
the
ship
prestrud
had
the
cinematograph
apparatus
with
him
and
a
lot
of
photographs
were
also
taken
the
leader
of
the
japanese
expedition
has
written
somewhere
or
other
that
the
reason
of
shackleton
losing
all
his
ponies
was
that
the
ponies
were
not
kept
in
tents
at
night
but
had
to
lie
outside
he
thought
the
ponies
ought
to
be
in
the
tents
and
the
men
outside
from
this
one
would
think
they
were
great
lovers
of
animals
but
i
must
confess
that
was
not
the
impression
i
received
they
had
put
penguins
into
little
boxes
to
take
them
alive
to
japan
round
about
the
deck
lay
dead
and
skua
gulls
in
heaps
on
the
ice
close
to
the
vessel
was
a
seal
ripped
open
with
part
of
its
entrails
on
the
ice
but
the
seal
was
still
alive
neither
prestrud
nor
i
had
any
sort
of
weapon
that
we
could
kill
the
seal
with
so
we
asked
the
japanese
to
do
it
but
they
only
grinned
and
laughed
a
little
way
off
two
of
them
were
coming
across
the
ice
with
a
seal
in
front
of
them
they
drove
it
on
with
two
long
poles
with
which
they
pricked
it
when
it
would
not
go
if
it
fell
into
a
crack
they
dug
it
up
again
as
you
would
see
men
quarrying
stone
at
home
it
had
not
enough
life
in
it
to
be
able
to
escape
its
tormentors
all
this
was
accompanied
by
laughter
and
jokes
on
arrival
at
the
ship
the
animal
was
nearly
dead
and
it
was
left
there
till
it
expired
on
the
we
had
a
fresh
wind
and
a
lot
of
ice
went
out
the
japanese
were
occupied
most
of
the
night
in
going
round
among
the
floes
and
picking
up
men
dogs
cases
and
so
on
as
they
had
put
a
good
deal
on
to
the
ice
in
the
course
of
the
day
as
the
ice
came
out
so
the
fram
went
in
right
up
to
fat
while
the
kainan
maru
drifted
farther
and
farther
out
till
at
last
she
disappeared
nor
did
we
see
the
vessel
again
but
a
couple
of
men
with
a
tent
stayed
on
the
barrier
as
long
as
we
were
in
the
bay
on
the
night
of
the
there
was
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
west
and
we
drifted
so
far
out
in
the
thick
snow
that
it
was
only
on
the
afternoon
of
the
that
we
could
make
our
way
in
again
through
a
mass
of
ice
in
the
course
of
these
two
days
so
much
ice
had
broken
up
that
we
came
right
in
to
fat
or
almost
to
framheim
and
that
was
very
lucky
as
we
stood
in
over
the
bay
of
whales
we
caught
sight
of
a
big
norwegian
naval
ensign
flying
on
the
barrier
at
cape
man
head
and
i
then
knew
that
the
southern
party
had
arrived
we
went
therefore
as
far
south
as
possible
and
blew
our
powerful
siren
nor
was
it
very
long
before
eight
men
came
tearing
down
there
was
great
enthusiasm
the
first
man
on
board
was
the
chief
i
was
so
certain
he
had
reached
the
goal
that
i
never
asked
him
not
till
an
hour
later
when
we
had
discussed
all
kinds
of
other
things
did
i
enquire
well
of
course
you
have
been
at
the
south
pole
we
lay
there
for
a
couple
of
days
on
account
of
the
short
distance
from
framheim
provisions
outfit
were
brought
on
board
if
such
great
masses
of
ice
had
not
drifted
out
in
the
last
few
days
it
would
probably
have
taken
us
a
week
or
two
to
get
the
same
quantity
on
board
at
on
january
in
a
thick
fog
we
took
our
moorings
on
board
and
waved
a
last
farewell
to
the
mighty
barrier
from
the
barrier
to
buenos
aires
via
hobart
the
first
day
after
our
departure
from
the
barrier
everything
we
had
taken
on
board
was
stowed
away
so
that
one
would
not
have
thought
our
numbers
were
doubled
or
that
we
had
taken
several
hundred
cases
and
a
lot
of
outfit
on
board
the
change
was
only
noticed
on
deck
where
powerful
dogs
made
an
uproar
all
day
long
and
in
the
which
was
entirely
changed
this
saloon
after
being
deserted
for
a
year
was
now
full
of
men
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
there
especially
as
everyone
had
something
to
tell
the
chief
of
his
trip
prestrud
of
his
and
gjertsen
and
i
of
the
fram
however
there
was
not
very
much
time
for
yarning
the
chief
at
once
began
writing
cablegrams
and
lectures
which
prestrud
and
i
translated
into
english
and
the
chief
then
copied
again
on
a
typewriter
in
addition
to
this
i
was
occupied
the
whole
time
in
drawing
charts
so
that
on
arrival
at
hobart
everything
was
ready
the
time
passed
quickly
though
the
voyage
was
fearfully
long
as
regards
the
we
were
extremely
lucky
it
lay
in
exactly
the
same
spot
where
we
had
met
with
it
in
that
is
in
about
lat
we
went
along
the
edge
of
it
for
a
very
short
time
and
then
it
was
done
with
to
the
north
of
we
saw
nothing
but
a
few
small
icebergs
we
made
terribly
slow
progress
to
the
northward
how
slow
may
perhaps
be
understood
if
i
quote
my
diary
for
february
this
trip
is
slower
than
anything
we
have
had
before
now
and
then
we
manage
an
average
rate
of
two
knots
an
hour
in
a
day
run
in
the
last
four
days
we
have
covered
a
distance
that
before
would
have
been
too
little
for
a
single
day
we
have
been
at
it
now
for
nearly
a
month
and
are
still
only
between
lat
and
gales
from
the
north
are
almost
the
order
of
the
day
etc
however
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
and
the
time
was
well
employed
with
all
we
had
to
do
after
a
five
weeks
struggle
we
at
last
reached
hobart
and
anchored
in
the
splendid
harbour
on
march
our
fresh
provisions
from
buenos
aires
just
lasted
out
the
last
of
the
fresh
potatoes
were
finished
a
couple
of
days
before
our
arrival
and
the
last
pig
was
killed
when
we
had
been
at
hobart
two
days
the
fram
remained
here
for
thirteen
days
which
were
chiefly
spent
in
repairing
the
propeller
and
cleaning
the
engine
in
addition
to
this
the
which
was
nearly
broken
in
the
middle
was
spliced
as
we
had
no
opportunity
of
getting
a
new
one
the
first
week
was
quiet
on
board
as
owing
to
the
circumstances
there
was
no
communication
with
the
shore
but
after
that
the
ship
was
full
of
visitors
so
that
we
were
not
very
sorry
to
get
away
again
of
our
dogs
were
presented
to
mawson
the
leader
of
the
australian
expedition
and
only
those
dogs
that
had
been
to
the
south
pole
and
a
few
puppies
eighteen
in
all
were
left
on
board
while
we
lay
in
hobart
mawson
ship
the
aurora
came
in
i
went
aboard
her
one
day
and
have
thus
been
on
board
the
vessels
of
all
the
present
antarctic
expeditions
on
the
terra
nova
the
british
on
february
in
the
bay
of
whales
on
the
deutschland
the
german
in
september
and
october
in
buenos
aires
on
the
kainan
maru
the
japanese
on
january
in
the
bay
of
whales
and
finally
on
the
aurora
in
hobart
not
forgetting
the
fram
which
of
course
i
think
best
of
all
on
march
the
fram
weighed
anchor
and
left
tasmania
we
made
very
poor
progress
to
begin
with
as
we
had
calms
for
nearly
three
weeks
in
spite
of
its
being
the
month
of
march
in
the
west
wind
belt
of
the
south
pacific
on
the
morning
of
easter
sunday
april
the
wind
first
freshened
from
the
and
blew
day
after
day
a
stiff
breeze
and
a
gale
alternately
so
that
we
went
splendidly
all
the
way
to
the
falkland
islands
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
topsail
was
reefed
for
nearly
five
weeks
on
account
of
the
fragile
state
of
the
yard
i
believe
most
of
us
wanted
to
get
on
fast
the
trip
was
now
over
for
the
present
and
those
who
had
families
at
home
naturally
wanted
to
be
with
them
as
soon
as
they
could
perhaps
that
was
why
we
went
so
well
on
april
snuppesen
gave
birth
to
eight
pups
four
of
these
were
killed
while
the
rest
two
of
each
sex
were
allowed
to
live
on
maundy
thursday
april
we
were
in
long
and
changed
the
date
so
that
we
had
two
maundy
thursdays
in
one
week
this
gave
us
a
good
many
holidays
running
and
i
can
not
say
the
effect
is
altogether
cheerful
it
was
a
good
thing
when
easter
tuesday
came
round
as
an
ordinary
on
may
we
passed
cape
horn
in
very
fair
weather
it
is
true
we
had
a
of
hurricane
violence
but
it
did
not
last
much
more
than
half
an
hour
for
a
few
days
the
temperature
was
a
little
below
but
it
rose
rapidly
as
soon
as
we
were
out
in
the
atlantic
from
hobart
to
cape
horn
we
saw
no
ice
after
passing
the
falkland
islands
we
had
a
head
wind
so
that
the
last
part
of
the
trip
was
nothing
to
boast
of
on
the
night
of
may
we
passed
montevideo
where
the
chief
had
arrived
a
few
hours
before
from
here
up
the
river
la
plata
we
went
so
slowly
on
account
of
head
wind
that
we
did
not
anchor
in
the
roads
of
buenos
aires
till
the
afternoon
of
the
almost
exactly
at
the
same
time
as
the
chief
landed
at
buenos
aires
when
i
went
ashore
next
morning
and
met
christophersen
he
was
in
great
this
is
just
like
a
fairy
tale
he
said
and
it
could
not
be
denied
that
it
was
an
amusing
coincidence
the
chief
of
course
was
equally
pleased
on
the
the
argentine
national
fête
the
fram
was
moored
at
the
same
quay
that
we
had
left
on
october
at
our
departure
there
were
exactly
seven
people
on
board
to
say
but
as
far
as
i
could
see
there
were
more
than
this
when
we
arrived
and
i
was
able
to
make
out
from
newspapers
and
other
sources
that
in
the
course
of
a
couple
of
months
the
third
fram
expedition
had
grown
considerably
in
popularity
in
conclusion
i
will
give
one
or
two
data
since
the
fram
left
christiania
on
june
we
have
been
two
and
a
half
times
round
the
globe
the
distance
covered
is
about
nautical
miles
the
lowest
reading
of
the
barometer
during
this
time
was
inches
millimetres
in
march
in
the
south
pacific
and
the
highest
inches
millimetres
in
october
in
the
south
atlantic
on
june
the
second
anniversary
of
our
leaving
christiania
all
the
members
of
the
expedition
except
the
chief
and
myself
left
for
norway
and
the
first
half
of
the
expedition
was
thus
brought
to
a
fortunate
conclusion
chapter
i
the
fram
by
commodore
christian
blom
colin
archer
says
in
his
description
of
the
fram
in
fridtjof
account
of
the
norwegian
arctic
expedition
that
the
successful
result
of
an
expedition
such
as
that
planned
and
carried
out
by
nansen
in
the
years
must
depend
on
the
care
with
which
all
possible
contingencies
are
foreseen
and
precautions
taken
to
meet
them
and
the
choice
of
every
detail
of
the
equipment
with
special
regard
to
the
use
to
which
it
will
be
put
to
no
part
of
the
equipment
he
says
could
this
apply
with
greater
force
than
to
the
ship
which
was
to
carry
nansen
and
his
companions
on
their
adventurous
voyage
colin
archer
then
built
the
ship
fram
was
her
name
and
she
showed
first
on
fridtjof
nansen
famous
voyage
and
afterwards
on
sverdrup
long
wintering
expedition
in
ellesmere
land
that
she
answered
her
purpose
completely
nay
she
greatly
exceeded
the
boldest
expectations
then
roald
amundsen
decided
to
set
out
on
a
voyage
not
less
adventurous
than
the
two
former
and
he
looked
about
for
a
suitable
ship
it
was
natural
that
he
should
think
of
the
fram
but
she
was
old
about
sixteen
years
and
had
been
exposed
to
many
a
hard
buffet
it
was
said
that
she
was
a
good
deal
damaged
by
decay
roald
amundsen
however
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
discouraged
by
these
misgivings
but
wished
to
see
for
himself
what
kind
of
a
craft
the
fram
was
after
her
two
commissions
he
therefore
came
down
to
horten
with
colin
archer
on
june
and
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
vessel
he
then
in
the
spring
of
requested
the
naval
dockyard
at
horten
to
repair
the
ship
and
carry
out
the
alterations
he
considered
necessary
for
his
enterprise
before
giving
an
account
of
the
repairs
and
alterations
to
the
vessel
in
we
shall
briefly
recapitulate
with
the
permission
a
part
of
the
description
of
the
fram
in
fridtjof
work
especially
as
regards
the
constructive
peculiarities
of
the
vessel
the
problem
which
it
was
sought
to
solve
in
the
construction
of
the
fram
was
that
of
providing
a
ship
which
could
survive
the
crushing
embrace
of
the
arctic
to
fit
her
for
this
was
the
object
before
which
all
other
considerations
had
to
give
way
but
apart
from
the
question
of
mere
strength
of
construction
there
were
problems
of
design
and
model
which
it
was
thought
would
play
an
important
part
in
the
attainment
of
the
chief
object
it
is
sometimes
prudent
in
an
encounter
to
avoid
the
full
force
of
a
blow
instead
of
resisting
it
even
if
it
could
be
met
without
damage
and
there
was
reason
to
think
that
by
a
judicious
choice
of
model
something
might
be
done
to
break
the
force
of
the
and
thus
lessen
its
danger
examples
of
this
had
been
seen
in
small
norwegian
vessels
that
had
been
caught
in
the
ice
near
spitzbergen
and
novaya
zemlya
it
often
happens
that
they
are
lifted
right
out
of
the
water
by
the
pressure
of
the
ice
without
sustaining
serious
damage
and
these
vessels
are
not
particularly
strong
but
have
like
most
small
a
considerable
dead
rising
and
sloping
sides
the
ice
encounters
these
sloping
sides
and
presses
in
under
the
bilge
on
both
sides
until
the
meet
under
the
keel
and
the
ship
is
raised
up
into
the
bed
that
is
formed
by
the
ice
itself
in
order
to
turn
this
principle
to
account
it
was
decided
to
depart
entirely
from
the
usual
and
to
adopt
a
form
that
would
offer
no
vulnerable
point
on
the
ship
side
but
would
cause
the
increasing
horizontal
pressure
of
the
ice
to
effect
a
raising
of
the
ship
as
described
above
in
the
construction
of
the
fram
it
was
sought
to
solve
this
problem
by
avoiding
plane
or
concave
surfaces
thus
giving
the
vessel
as
far
as
possible
round
and
full
lines
besides
increasing
the
power
of
resistance
to
external
pressure
this
form
has
the
advantage
of
making
it
easy
for
the
ice
to
glide
along
the
bottom
in
any
direction
the
fram
was
a
schooner
with
an
auxiliary
engine
of
indicated
which
was
calculated
to
give
her
a
speed
of
knots
when
moderately
loaded
with
a
coal
consumption
of
tons
a
day
the
vessel
was
designed
to
be
only
large
enough
to
carry
the
necessary
provisions
and
other
equipment
for
a
period
of
five
years
and
to
give
room
for
the
crew
her
principal
dimensions
are
length
of
keel
english
feet
length
of
waterline
length
over
all
beam
on
waterline
greatest
beam
depth
her
displacement
with
a
draught
of
feet
is
tons
the
measurements
are
taken
to
the
outside
of
the
planks
but
do
not
include
the
by
measurement
she
was
found
to
be
gross
tons
register
and
tons
net
the
ship
with
engines
and
boilers
was
calculated
to
weigh
about
tons
with
the
draught
above
mentioned
which
gives
a
freeboard
of
feet
there
would
thus
be
tons
available
for
cargo
this
weight
was
actually
exceeded
by
tons
which
left
a
freeboard
of
only
inches
when
the
ship
sailed
on
her
first
voyage
this
additional
immersion
could
only
have
awkward
effects
when
the
ship
came
into
the
ice
as
its
effect
would
then
be
to
retard
the
lifting
by
the
ice
on
which
the
safety
of
the
ship
was
believed
to
depend
in
a
great
measure
not
only
was
there
a
greater
weight
to
lift
but
there
was
a
considerably
greater
danger
of
the
walls
of
ice
that
would
pile
themselves
against
the
ship
sides
falling
over
the
bulwarks
and
covering
the
deck
before
the
ice
began
to
raise
her
the
load
would
however
be
lightened
by
the
time
the
ship
was
frozen
fast
events
showed
that
she
was
readily
lifted
when
the
set
in
and
that
the
danger
of
injury
from
falling
blocks
of
ice
was
less
than
had
been
expected
the
fram
keel
is
of
american
elm
in
two
lengths
inches
square
the
room
and
space
is
feet
the
are
almost
all
of
oak
obtained
from
the
naval
dockyard
at
horten
where
they
had
lain
for
many
years
thus
being
perfectly
seasoned
the
timbers
were
all
grown
to
shape
the
frames
consist
of
two
tiers
of
timbers
everywhere
each
timber
measuring
to
inches
fore
and
aft
the
two
tiers
of
timbers
are
fitted
together
and
bolted
so
that
they
form
a
solid
and
compact
whole
the
joints
of
the
are
covered
with
iron
plates
the
lining
consists
of
in
good
lengths
and
of
varying
thickness
from
to
inches
the
keelson
is
also
of
in
two
layers
one
above
the
other
each
layer
inches
square
from
the
stem
to
the
under
the
boiler
and
engine
there
was
only
room
for
one
keelson
there
are
two
decks
the
beams
of
the
are
of
american
or
german
oak
those
of
the
lower
deck
and
of
and
norwegian
fir
all
the
deck
planks
are
of
norwegian
fir
inches
in
the
and
inches
elsewhere
the
beams
are
fastened
to
the
ship
sides
by
knees
of
norwegian
spruce
of
which
about
were
used
wooden
knees
were
as
a
rule
preferred
to
iron
ones
as
they
are
more
elastic
a
good
many
iron
knees
were
used
however
where
wood
was
less
suitable
in
the
boiler
and
engine
room
the
beams
of
the
lower
deck
had
to
be
raised
about
feet
to
give
sufficient
height
for
the
engines
the
upper
deck
was
similarly
raised
from
the
to
the
mainmast
forming
a
under
which
the
cabins
were
placed
on
this
immediately
forward
of
the
funnel
a
was
placed
arranged
as
a
from
which
two
companions
one
on
each
side
led
down
to
the
cabins
besides
the
there
is
a
double
layer
of
outside
planking
of
oak
the
two
first
strakes
garboard
strakes
however
are
single
inches
thick
and
are
bolted
both
to
the
keel
and
to
the
the
first
inner
layer
of
planks
is
inches
thick
and
is
only
fastened
with
nails
outside
this
comes
a
layer
of
planks
fastened
with
oak
trenails
and
through
bolts
as
usual
the
two
top
strakes
are
single
again
and
inches
thick
the
is
of
greenheart
and
covers
the
whole
ship
side
from
the
keel
to
inches
from
the
sheer
strake
it
is
only
fastened
with
nails
and
jagged
bolts
each
layer
of
planks
was
caulked
and
pitched
before
the
next
one
was
laid
thus
only
about
or
inches
of
the
keel
projects
below
the
planking
and
this
part
of
the
keel
is
rounded
off
so
as
not
to
hinder
the
ice
from
passing
under
the
ship
bottom
the
intervals
between
the
timbers
were
filled
with
a
mixture
of
pitch
and
sawdust
heated
together
and
put
in
warm
the
ship
side
thus
forms
a
compact
mass
varying
in
thickness
from
to
inches
as
a
consequence
of
all
the
intervals
between
the
timbers
being
filled
up
there
is
no
room
for
under
the
lining
a
loose
bottom
was
therefore
laid
a
few
inches
above
the
lining
on
each
side
of
the
keelson
in
order
to
strengthen
the
sides
still
more
and
especially
to
prevent
stretching
iron
braces
were
placed
on
the
lining
running
from
the
clamps
of
the
top
deck
down
to
well
past
the
the
stem
consists
of
three
massive
oak
beams
one
inside
the
other
forming
together
feet
of
solid
oak
fore
and
aft
with
a
breadth
of
inches
the
three
external
plankings
as
well
as
the
lining
are
all
rabbeted
into
the
stem
the
is
in
two
thicknesses
placed
side
by
side
and
measures
inches
and
inches
fore
and
aft
it
will
be
seen
from
the
plan
that
the
overhang
aft
runs
out
into
a
point
and
that
there
is
thus
no
transom
to
each
side
of
the
is
fitted
a
stout
parallel
to
the
longitudinal
midship
section
forming
so
to
speak
a
double
and
the
space
between
them
forms
a
well
which
goes
right
up
through
the
top
deck
the
is
placed
in
the
middle
of
this
well
and
divides
it
into
two
parts
one
for
the
propeller
and
one
for
the
rudder
in
this
way
it
is
possible
to
lift
both
the
rudder
and
the
screw
out
of
the
water
the
rudder
is
so
hung
that
the
which
is
cylindrical
turns
on
its
own
axis
to
prevent
the
rudder
being
jammed
if
the
well
should
be
filled
with
ice
aft
of
the
the
space
between
the
is
filled
with
solid
wood
and
the
whole
is
securely
bolted
together
with
bolts
running
the
join
the
in
this
part
and
are
fastened
to
them
by
means
of
knees
the
stem
and
are
connected
to
the
keelson
and
to
the
keel
by
stout
knees
of
timber
and
both
the
ship
sides
are
bound
together
with
solid
breasthooks
and
crutches
of
wood
or
iron
although
the
fram
was
not
specially
built
for
ramming
it
was
probable
that
now
and
then
she
would
be
obliged
to
force
her
way
through
the
ice
her
bow
and
stern
were
therefore
shod
in
the
usual
way
on
the
forward
side
of
the
stem
a
iron
was
bolted
from
the
to
some
way
under
the
keel
outside
this
iron
plates
x
inches
were
fastened
over
the
stem
and
for
feet
on
each
side
of
it
these
iron
plates
were
placed
close
together
and
thus
formed
a
continuous
to
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
keel
the
sharp
edge
of
the
stern
was
protected
in
the
same
way
and
the
lower
sides
of
the
well
were
lined
with
thick
iron
plates
the
which
owing
to
its
exposed
position
may
be
said
to
form
the
heel
of
the
ship
was
strengthened
with
three
heavy
pieces
of
iron
one
in
the
opening
for
the
screw
and
one
on
each
side
of
the
two
posts
and
the
keel
and
bolted
together
with
bolts
running
extraordinary
precautions
were
taken
for
strengthening
the
sides
which
were
particularly
exposed
to
destruction
by
and
which
on
account
of
their
form
compose
the
weakest
part
of
the
hull
these
precautions
will
best
be
seen
in
the
sections
figs
and
under
each
beam
in
both
decks
were
placed
diagonal
stays
of
fir
x
inches
almost
at
right
angles
to
the
ship
sides
and
securely
fastened
to
the
sides
and
to
the
beams
by
wooden
knees
there
are
of
these
stays
distributed
over
the
ship
in
addition
there
are
under
the
beams
three
rows
of
vertical
stanchions
between
decks
and
one
row
in
the
lower
hold
from
the
keelson
these
are
connected
to
the
keelson
to
the
beams
and
to
each
other
by
iron
bands
the
whole
of
the
ship
interior
is
thus
filled
with
a
network
of
braces
and
stays
arranged
in
such
a
way
as
to
transfer
and
distribute
the
pressure
from
without
and
give
rigidity
to
the
whole
construction
in
the
engine
and
boiler
room
it
was
necessary
to
modify
the
arrangement
of
stays
so
as
to
give
room
for
the
engines
and
boiler
all
the
iron
with
the
exception
of
the
heaviest
forgings
is
galvanized
when
otto
sverdrup
was
to
use
the
fram
for
his
polar
expedition
he
had
a
number
of
alterations
carried
out
the
most
important
of
these
consisted
in
laying
a
new
deck
in
the
fore
part
of
the
ship
from
the
bulkhead
forward
of
the
to
the
stem
at
a
height
of
feet
inches
to
the
upper
side
of
the
planks
above
the
old
the
space
below
the
new
deck
was
fitted
as
a
with
a
number
of
leading
out
of
it
a
large
workroom
etc
the
old
immediately
forward
of
the
funnel
was
removed
and
in
its
place
a
large
was
fitted
the
foremast
was
raised
and
stepped
in
the
lower
deck
a
false
keel
inches
deep
and
inches
broad
was
placed
below
the
keel
a
number
of
minor
alterations
were
also
carried
out
after
the
fram
returned
in
from
her
second
expedition
under
captain
sverdrup
she
was
sent
down
to
horten
to
be
laid
up
in
the
naval
dockyard
not
long
after
the
vessel
had
arrived
at
the
dockyard
captain
sverdrup
proposed
various
repairs
and
alterations
the
repairs
were
carried
out
in
part
but
the
alterations
were
postponed
pending
a
decision
as
to
the
future
employment
of
the
vessel
the
fram
then
lay
idle
in
the
naval
harbour
until
when
she
was
used
by
the
marine
artillery
as
a
floating
magazine
in
the
same
year
a
good
deal
of
the
vessel
outfit
amongst
other
things
all
her
sails
and
most
of
her
rigging
was
lost
in
a
fire
in
one
of
the
naval
storehouses
where
these
things
were
stored
in
the
ship
keel
and
stem
which
are
of
elm
and
oak
were
sheathed
with
zinc
while
the
outer
sheathing
which
is
of
greenheart
was
kept
coated
with
and
copper
composition
in
the
whole
outer
sheathing
below
the
was
covered
with
zinc
this
was
removed
in
when
the
ship
was
prepared
for
her
third
commission
under
roald
amundsen
in
a
thorough
examination
of
the
vessel
was
made
as
it
was
suspected
that
the
timber
inside
the
thick
cork
insulation
that
surrounded
the
cabins
had
begun
to
decay
on
previous
expeditions
the
cabins
provision
hold
aft
and
workrooms
forward
of
the
had
been
insulated
with
several
thicknesses
of
wooden
panelling
the
interstices
were
filled
with
cork
alternately
with
reindeer
hair
and
thick
felt
and
linoleum
in
the
course
of
years
damp
had
penetrated
into
the
material
with
the
result
that
fungus
and
decay
had
spread
in
the
surrounding
woodwork
thus
it
was
seen
during
the
examination
in
that
the
panelling
and
ceiling
of
the
cabins
in
question
were
to
a
great
extent
rotten
or
attacked
by
fungus
in
the
same
way
the
under
side
of
the
upper
deck
over
these
cabins
was
partly
attacked
by
fungus
as
were
its
beams
knees
and
carlings
the
lower
deck
on
the
other
hand
was
better
preserved
the
timbers
of
spruce
or
fir
between
the
in
the
cabins
were
damaged
by
fungus
while
the
themselves
which
were
of
oak
were
good
the
outer
lining
outside
the
insulated
parts
was
also
somewhat
damaged
by
fungus
in
the
over
the
the
spruce
knees
were
partly
rotten
as
were
some
of
the
beams
while
the
lining
was
here
fairly
good
the
masts
and
were
somewhat
attacked
by
decay
while
the
rest
of
the
spars
were
good
during
and
after
the
examination
all
the
panelling
and
insulation
was
removed
the
parts
attacked
by
fungus
or
decay
were
also
removed
and
the
woodwork
coated
with
carbolineum
or
tar
the
masts
and
various
stores
and
fittings
were
taken
ashore
at
the
same
time
it
was
found
that
the
rest
of
the
is
the
whole
of
the
lower
part
of
the
hull
right
up
to
the
cabin
perfectly
sound
and
as
good
as
new
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
strain
anywhere
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
any
better
proof
of
the
excellence
of
the
construction
after
two
protracted
expeditions
to
the
most
northern
regions
to
which
any
ship
has
ever
penetrated
where
the
vessel
was
often
exposed
to
the
severest
and
in
spite
of
her
being
in
fifteen
years
old
the
examination
showed
that
her
actual
hull
the
part
of
the
ship
that
has
to
resist
the
heavy
strain
of
water
and
ice
was
in
just
as
good
condition
as
when
she
was
new
the
vessel
was
then
left
in
this
state
until
as
already
mentioned
roald
amundsen
and
her
builder
colin
archer
came
down
to
the
dockyard
on
june
and
with
the
necessary
assistance
made
an
examination
of
her
after
some
correspondence
and
verbal
conferences
between
roald
amundsen
and
the
dockyard
the
latter
on
march
made
a
tender
for
the
repairs
and
alterations
to
the
fram
the
repairs
consisted
of
making
good
the
damage
to
the
topsides
referred
to
above
the
alterations
were
due
in
the
first
instance
to
the
circumstance
that
the
and
boiler
the
latter
had
had
its
flues
burnt
out
on
sverdrup
expedition
were
to
be
replaced
by
an
as
a
consequence
of
this
the
would
disappear
while
on
the
other
hand
a
large
number
of
capable
of
containing
about
tons
of
oil
were
to
be
put
in
it
was
also
considered
desirable
to
rig
on
the
foremast
in
view
of
the
great
distances
that
were
to
be
sailed
on
the
proposed
expedition
the
present
arrangement
of
the
vessel
will
best
be
followed
by
referring
to
the
elevation
and
plan
figs
and
in
the
extreme
of
the
lower
hold
is
placed
the
diesel
engine
surrounded
by
its
auxiliary
machinery
and
in
addition
some
of
the
tanks
containing
the
fuel
itself
are
placed
in
the
marked

the
other
tanks
shown
in
the
marked
serve
for
storing
lubricating

have
in
the
lower

the
main
store
of

in
tanks
marked
o
of
various
sizes
on
account
of
their
having
to
be
placed
among
the
numerous
diagonal
stays
the
tanks
are
filled
and
emptied
by
means
of
a
pump
and
a
petroleum
hose
through
a
manhole
in
the
top
over
which
again
are
hatches
in
the
deck
above
no
connecting
pipes
are
fitted
between
the
different
tanks
for
fear
they
might
be
damaged
by
frost
or
shock
thus
involving
a
risk
of
losing
oil
the
main

is
placed
over
the
forward
side
of
the

it
is
supported
on
strong
steel
girders
inside

there
are
two
smaller
ones
settling

we
now
find
a
space
arranged
on

the
lower
part
of
this
space
is
occupied
by
two

end
of
the
two

lead
to
the
large
workroom
amidships
these
passages
run
past
what
were
formerly
but
are
now
arranged
as
cabins
intended
only
to
be
used
in
milder
climates
as
they
are
not
provided
with
any
special
insulation
from

large
workroom
is
the
galley
this
room
is
entirely
lined
with
zinc
both
on

of
the
danger
of

the
main
features
of
its
working
will
be
seen
in
the
drawing
there
are
two
independent
transmissions
by
belt
and
by
chain
the
former
is
usually
employed
the
chain
transmission
was
provided
as
a
reserve
since
it
was
feared
that
might
prove
unserviceable
in
a
cold
climate
this
fear
however
has
hitherto
been
ungrounded

with
a
leather
covering
the

the
usual
nickel
action
that
was
formerly
general
on
our
ships
and
is
still
widely
used
on
smacks
these
simple
pumps
have
been
shown
by
experience
to
work
better
than
any
others
in
severe
cold
the

has
skylights
over
the
the
main

one
of
these
was
left
behind
on
the
ice
barrier
where
it
was
buried
in
snow
when
the

left
it
was
brought
ashore
that
the
wintering

might
have
a

new
there
was
a
crack
in
the
beam
that
forms
the
support
for
the
mizzenmast
it
was
therefore
strengthened
with
two
heavy
iron

secured
by
two
strong

also
placed
on
each
side
of
the

been
converted
into
a

there
are
now
standing

about
square
feet
all
the

are
insulated
in
the
same
way
as
before
though
it
has
been
found
possible
to
simplify
this
somewhat
in
general
the
insulation
consists
of
in
the
cabins
against
the
ship
side
and
under
the
upper

there
is
first
a
layer
of
cork

when
the

was
docked
before
leaving

the
zinc
sheathing
was
removed
as
already
stated
since
fears
were
entertained
that
it
would
be
torn
by
the
ice
and
would
then
prevent
the
ice
from
slipping
readily
under
the

the

two
anchors
but
the
former
port
anchor
has
been
replaced
by
a
considerably
heavier
one

hundredweight
with
a
correspondingly
heavier
this
was
done
with
a
special
view
to

in
order
to
trim
the
ship
as
much
as
possible
by
the

was
desirable
on
account
of
her
carrying
a
weather
helm
a
number
of
heavy
spare
stores
such
as
the
old
port
anchor
and
its

been
made
so
that

are
provided
over
the
whole

the
dogs
have
been
given
dry
and
as
far
as
possible
cool
quarters
for
the
voyage
through
the
tropics
it
is
proposed
to
use
the
ship
spars
as
supports
for
a
roof
of
boards
to
be
put
up

the
fram
new
engine
is
a
direct
reversible
built
by
the
diesel
motor
of
stockholm
it
is
a
diesel
engine
with
four
working
and
two
cylinders
and
develops
normally
at
revolutions
per
minute
effective
with
a
consumption
of
oil
of
about
ounces
per
effective
per
hour
with
this
comparatively
small
consumption
the

capacity
will
carry

much
farther
than
if
she
had
a
a
consideration
of
great
importance
in
her
forthcoming
long
voyage
in
the
arctic
sea
with
her
oil
capacity
of
about
tons
she
will
thus
be
able
to
go
uninterruptedly
for
about
hours
or
about
days
if
we
reckon
her
speed
under
engine
power
alone
at
knots
she
will
be
able
to
go
about
nautical
miles
without
replenishing
her
it
is
a
fault
in
the
new
engine
that
its
number
of
revolutions
is
very
high
which
necessitates
the
use
of
a
propeller
of
small
diameter
feet
inches
and
thus
of
low
efficiency
in
the
existing
conditions
this
is
the
more
marked
on
account
of
the
unusual
thickness
of
the
fram
which
masks
the
propeller
to
a
great
extent
the
position
of
the
engine
will
be
seen

gases
from
the

from
this
valve
two
horizontal
pipes
run
along
the
after
side
of
the
bridge
one
to
each
side
by
means
of
the
valve
the
gases
can
be
diverted
to
one
side
or
the
other
according
to
the
direction
of
the

besides
the
usual
auxiliary

remarks
on
the
meteorological
observations
at
framheim
by
birkeland
on
account
of
the
improvised
character
of
the
south
polar
expedition
the
meteorological
department
on
the
fram
was
not
so
complete
as
it
ought
to
have
been
it
had
not
been
possible
to
provide
the
aerological
outfit
at
the

and
the
meteorologist
of

was
therefore
left
behind
in

but
certain
things
were
wanting
even
to
complete
the
equipment
of
an
ordinary
meteorological
station
such
as
minimum
thermometers
and
the
necessary
instructions
that
should
have
accompanied
one
or
two
of
the
instruments
fortunately
among
the
veterans
of
the
expedition
there
were
several
practised
observers
and
notwithstanding
all
drawbacks
a
fine
series
of
observations
was
obtained
during
ten
months
stay
in
on
the
antarctic
continent
these
observations
will
provide
a
valuable
supplement
to
the
simultaneous
records
of
other
expeditions
especially
the
british
in
mcmurdo
sound
and
the
german
in
weddell
sea
above
all
as
regards
the
hypsometer
observations
for
the
determination
of
altitude
on
sledge
journeys
it
may
be
hoped
in
any
case
that
it
will
be
possible
to
interpolate
the
atmospheric
pressure
at
in
all
parts
of
the
antarctic
continent
that
were
traversed
by
the
sledging
expeditions
for
this
reason
the
publication
of
a
provisional
working
out
of
the
observations
is
of
great
importance
at
the
present
moment
although
the
general
public
will
perhaps
look
upon
the
long
rows
of
figures
as
tedious
and
superfluous
the
complete
working
out
of
these
observations
can
only
be
published
after
a
lapse
of
some
years
as
regards
the
accuracy
of
the
figures
here
given
it
must
be
noted
that
at
present
we
know
nothing
about
possible
alterations
in
the
errors
of
the
different
instruments
as
it
will
not
be
possible
to
have
the
instruments
examined
and
compared
until
we
arrive
at
san
francisco
next
year
we
have
provisionally
used
the
errors
that
were
determined
at
the
norwegian
meteorological
institute
before
the
expedition
sailed
it
does
not
appear
however
that
they
have
altered
to
any
great
extent
the
meteorological
outfit
on
the
fram
consisted
of
the

were

etc
the
marine

the
large

and
one
of
the
barographs
the
four
mercury
sling
thermometers
and
two
standard
thermometers
were
kept
on
board
the
fram
where
they
were
used
for
the
regular
observations
every
four
hours
on
the
vessel
long
voyages
backwards
and
forwards
as
will
be
seen
the
shore
party
was
thus
left
without
mercury
sling
thermometers
besides
having
no
minimum
thermometers
the
three
maximum
thermometers
proved
to
be
of
little
use
there
were
also
various
defects
in
the
clockwork
of
the
registering
instruments
the
barographs
and
thermographs
have
been
used
on
all
the
norwegian
polar
expeditions
the
hygrograph
is
also
an
old
instrument
which
in
the
course
of
its
career
has
worked
for
over
ten
years
in
christiania
where
the
atmosphere
is
by
no
means
merciful
to
delicate
instruments
its
clockwork
had
not
been
cleaned
before
it
was
sent
to
the
fram
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
the
other
four
instruments
the
barographs
worked
irreproachably
the
whole
time
but
one
of
the
thermographs
refused
absolutely
to
work
in
the
open
air
and
unfortunately
the
spindle
pivot
of
the
other
broke
as
early
as
april
at
first
the
clockwork
of
the
hygrograph
would
not
go
at
all
as
the
oil
had
become
thick
and
it
was
not
until
this
had
been
removed
by
prolonged
severe
heating
baking
in
the
oven
for
several
days
that
it
could
be
set
going
but
then
it
had
to
be
used
for
the
thermograph
the
mechanism
of
which
was
broken
so
that
no
registration
was
obtained
of
the
humidity
of
the
air
the
resulting
registrations
are
then
as
follows
from
framheim
one
set
of
barograms
and
two
sets
of
thermograms
of
which
one
gives
the
temperature
of
the
air
and
the
other
the
temperature
inside
the
house
where
the
barometers
and
barograph
were
placed
from
the
fram
we
have
barograms
for
the
whole
period
from
her
leaving
christiania
in
to
her
arrival
at
buenos
aires
for
the
third
time
in
of
course
none
of
these
registrations
can
be
taken
into
account
in
the
provisional
working
out
as
they
will
require
many
months
work
which
moreover
can
not
be
carried
out
with
advantage
until
we
have
ascertained
about
possible
changes
of
error
in
the
instruments
but
occasional
use
has
been
made
of
them
for
purposes
of
checking
and
for
supplying
the
only
observation
missing
in
the
ten
months
the
meteorological
station
at
framheim
was
arranged
in
this
way
the
barometers
barograph
and
one
thermograph
hung
inside
the
house
they
were
placed
in
the
kitchen
behind
the
door
of
the
which
usually
stood
open
and
thus
protected
them
from
the
radiant
heat
of
the
range
a
thermometer
a
hygrometer
and
the
other
thermograph
were
placed
in
a
screen
on
high
posts
and
with
louvred
sides
which
stood
at
a
distance
of
fifteen
yards
to
the
of
the
house
a
little
way
beyond
the
screen
again
stood
the
and
anemometer
at
the
end
of
september
the
screen
had
to
be
moved
a
few
yards
to
the
east
the
snow
had
drifted
about
it
until
it
was
only
feet
above
the
surface
whereas
it
ought
to
stand
at
the
height
of
a
man
at
the
same
time
the
was
moved
the
screen
was
constructed
by
lindström
from
his
recollection
of
the
old
fram
screen
the
two
mercury
barometers
the
fuess
normal
and
the
adie
standard
barometer
reached
framheim
in
good
condition
as
has
been
said
they
were
hung
in
the
kitchen
and
the
four
pocket
aneroids
were
hung
by
the
side
of
them
all
six
were
read
at
the
daily
observations
at
and
the
normal
barometer
the
instructions
for
which
were
missing
was
used
as
a
siphon
barometer
both
the
mercury
levels
being
read
and
the
bottom
screw
being
locked
fast
the
usual
mode
of
reading
it
on
the
other
hand
is
to
set
the
lower
level
at
zero
on
the
scale
by
turning
the
bottom
screw
at
every
observation
whereupon
the
upper
level
only
is
set
and
read
the
adie
standard
barometer
is
so
arranged
that
it
is
only
necessary
to
read
the
summit
of
the
mercury
it
appears
that
there
is
some
difference
between
the
atmospheric
pressure
values
of
the
two
instruments
but
this
is
chiefly
due
to
the
difficult
and
extremely
variable
conditions
of
temperature
there
may
be
a
difference
of
as
much
as
five
degrees
centigrade
between
the
thermometers
of
the
two
barometers
in
spite
of
their
hanging
side
by
side
at
about
the
same
height
from
the
floor
on
the
other
hand
the
normal
barometer
is
not
suited
to
daily
observations
especially
in
the
polar
regions
and
the
double
reading
entails
greater
liability
of
error
that
the
adie
barometer
is
rather
less
sensitive
than
the
other
is
of
small
importance
as
the
variations
of
atmospheric
pressure
at
framheim
were
not
very
great
in
the
provisional
working
out
therefore
the
readings
of
the
adie
barometer
alone
have
been
used
those
of
the
normal
barometer
however
have
been
experimentally
reduced
for
the
first
and
last
months
april
and
january
the
readings
have
been
corrected
for
the
temperature
of
the
mercury
the
constant
error
of
the
instrument
and
the
variation
of
the
force
of
gravity
from
the
normal
in
latitude
the
reduction
to
on
the
other
hand
has
not
been
made
it
amounts
to
millimetre
at
an
air
temperature
of
centigrade
the
observations
show
that
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
is
throughout
low
the
mean
for
the
ten
months
being
inches
millimetres
it
is
lower
in
winter
than
in
summer
july
having
inches
millimetres
and
december
inches
millimetres
as
the
mean
for
the
month
a
difference
of
millimetres
the
highest
observation
was
inches
millimetres
on
december
and
the
lowest
inches
millimetres
on
may
difference
millimetres
air
temperature
and
thermometers
as
has
already
been
stated
minimum
thermometers
and
mercury
sling
thermometers
were
wanting
for
the
first
six
months
only
toluene
sling
thermometers
were
used
sling
thermometers
are
short
narrow
glass
thermometers
with
a
strong
loop
at
the
top
before
being
read
they
are
briskly
swung
round
at
the
end
of
a
string
about
half
a
yard
long
or
in
a
special
apparatus
for
the
purpose
the
swinging
brings
the
thermometer
in
contact
with
a
great
volume
of
air
and
it
therefore
gives
the
real
temperature
of
the
air
more
readily
than
if
it
were
hanging
quietly
in
the
screen
from
october
a
mercury
thermometer
was
also
placed
in
the
screen
though
only
one
divided
to
whole
degrees
those
divided
to
fifths
of
a
degree
would
of
course
have
given
a
surer
reading
but
it
is
evident
nevertheless
that
the
toluene
thermometers
used
are
correct
to
less
than
half
a
degree
centigrade
and
even
this
difference
may
no
doubt
be
explained
by
one
thermometer
being
slung
while
the
other
was
fixed
the
observations
are
therefore
given
without
any
corrections
only
at
the
end
of
december
was
exclusive
use
made
of
mercury
thermometers
the
maximum
thermometers
taken
proved
of
so
little
use
that
they
were
soon
discarded
the
observations
have
not
been
included
here
it
was
due
to
a
misunderstanding
that
mercury
thermometers
were
not
also
used
in
the
first
during
those
periods
when
the
temperature
did
not
go
below
the
of
mercury
but
the
toluene
thermometers
in
use
were
old
and
good
instruments
so
that
the
observations
for
this
period
may
also
be
regarded
as
perfectly
reliable
of
course
all
the
thermometers
had
been
carefully
examined
at
the
norwegian
meteorological
institute
and
at
framheim
the
was
regularly
tested
in
melting
snow
the
results
show
that
the
winter
on
the
barrier
was
about
colder
than
it
usually
is
in
mcmurdo
sound
where
the
british
expeditions
winter
the
coldest
month
is
august
with
a
mean
temperature
of
on
fourteen
days
during
this
month
the
temperature
was
below
the
lowest
temperature
occurred
on
august
the
warmest
day
in
that
month
had
a
temperature
of
in
october
spring
begins
to
approach
and
in
december
the
temperature
culminates
with
a
mean
for
the
month
of
and
a
highest
maximum
temperature
of
the
temperature
was
thus
never
above
even
in
the
warmest
part
of
the
summer
the
daily
course
of
the
temperature
warmest
at
noon
and
coldest
towards
morning
is
of
course
not
noticeable
in
winter
as
the
sun
is
always
below
the
horizon
but
in
april
there
is
a
sign
of
it
and
from
september
onward
it
is
fairly
marked
although
the
difference
between
and
the
mean
of
and
only
amounts
to
in
the
monthly
mean
humidity
of
the
air
for
determining
the
relative
humidity
of
the
air
the
expedition
had
two
of
russeltvedt
torsion
hygrometers
this
instrument
has
been
accurately
described
in
the
meteorologische
zeitschrift
it
has
the
advantage
that
there
are
no
axles
or
sockets
to
be
rusted
or
soiled
or
filled
with
rime
or
fig

the
two
horsehairs
h
h
that
are
used
are
stretched
tight
by
a
torsion
clamp
z
z
and
l
which
also
carries
the
pointer
the
position
of
the
pointer
varies
with
the
length
of
the
hairs
which
again
is
dependent
on
the
degree
of
humidity
of
the
air
see
the
diagrams
these
instruments
have
been
in
use
in
norway
for
several
years
especially
at
inland
stations
where
the
winter
is
very
cold
and
they
have
shown
themselves
superior
to
all
others
in
accuracy
and
durability
but
there
was
no
one
on
the
fram
who
knew
anything
about
them
and
there
is
therefore
a
possibility
that
they
were
not
always
in
such
good
order
as
could
be
wished
on
september
especially
the
variations
are
very
remarkable
but
on
october
the
second
instrument
no
was
hung
out
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
the
correctness
of
the
subsequent
observations
it
is
seen
that
the
relative
humidity
attains
its
maximum
in
winter
in
the
months
of
july
and
august
with
a
mean
of
per
cent
the
driest
air
occurs
in
the
spring
month
of
november
with
a
mean
of
per
cent
the
remaining
months
vary
between
and
per
and
the
mean
of
the
whole
ten
months
is
per
cent
the
variations
quoted
must
be
regarded
as
very
small
on
the
other
hand
the
figures
themselves
are
very
high
when
the
low
temperatures
are
considered
and
this
is
doubtless
the
result
of
there
being
open
water
not
very
far
away
the
daily
course
of
humidity
is
contrary
to
the
course
of
the
temperature
and
does
not
show
itself
very
markedly
except
in
january
the
absolute
humidity
or
partial
pressure
of
aqueous
vapour
in
the
air
expressed
in
millimetres
in
the
height
of
the
mercury
in
the
same
way
as
the
pressure
of
the
atmosphere
follows
in
the
main
the
temperature
of
the
air
the
mean
value
for
the
whole
period
is
only

december
has
the
highest

mean
with
millimetres

the
lowest

the
absolutely
highest
observation
occurred
on
december
with

while
the
lowest

all
is
less
than
millimetre
and
can
therefore
only
be
expressed
by
it
occurred
frequently
in
the
course
of
the
winter
precipitation
any
attempt
to
measure
the
quantity
of
precipitation
even
approximately
had
to
be
abandoned
snowfall
never
occurred
in
still
weather
and
in
a
wind
there
was
always
a
drift
that
entirely
filled
the
gauge
on
june
and
actual
snowfall
was
observed
but
it
was
so
insignificant
that
it
could
not
be
measured
it
was
however
composed
of
genuine
flakes
of
snow
it
sometimes
happened
that
precipitation
of
very
small
particles
of
ice
was
noticed
these
grains
of
ice
can
be
seen
against
the
observation
lantern
and
heard
on
the
observer
headgear
but
on
returning
to
the
house
nothing
can
be
discovered
on
the
clothing
where
the
sign
for
snow
occurs
in
the
column
for
remarks
it
means
drift
these
days
are
included
among
days
of
precipitation
sleet
was
observed
only
once
in
december
rain
never
cloudiness
the
figures
indicate
how
many
tenths
of
the
visible
heavens
are
covered
by
clouds
or
mist
no
instrument
is
used
in
these
observations
they
depend
on
personal
estimate
they
had
to
be
abandoned
during
the
period
of
darkness
when
it
is
difficult
to
see
the
sky
wind
for
measuring
the
velocity
of
the
wind
the
expedition
had
a
cup
and
cross
anemometer
which
worked
excellently
the
whole
time
it
consists
of
a
horizontal
cross
with
a
hollow
hemisphere
on
each
of
the
four
arms
of
the
cross
the
openings
of
the
hemispheres
are
all
turned
towards
the
same
side
of
the
and
the
cross
can
revolve
with
a
minimum
of
friction
on
a
vertical
axis
at
the
point
of
junction
the
axis
is
connected
with
a
recording
mechanism
which
is
set
in
motion
at
each
observation
and
stopped
after
a
lapse
of
half
a
minute
when
the
figure
is
read
off
this
figure
denotes
the
velocity
of
the
wind
in
metres
per
second
and
is
directly
transferred
to
the
tables
here
converted
into
feet
per
second
the
monthly
means
vary
between
metres
feet
in
may
and
metres
feet
in
october
the
mean
for
the
whole
ten
months
is
metres
feet
per
second
these
velocities
may
be
characterized
as
surprisingly
small
and
the
number
of
stormy
days
agrees
with
this
low
velocity
their
number
for
the
whole
period
is
only
fairly
evenly

brought
by

from
the
antarctic
continent
south
victoria
land
and

by
schetelig
secretary
of
the
mineralogical
institute
of
christiania
university
the
collection
of
specimens
of
rocks
brought
back
by
roald
amundsen
from
his
south
polar
expedition
has
been
sent
by
him
to
the
mineralogical
institute
of
the
university
the
director
of
which
professor
brögger
has
been
good
enough
to
entrust
to
me
the
work
of
examining
this
rare
and
valuable
material
which
gives
us
information
of
the
structure
of
hitherto
untrodden
regions
roald
amundsen
himself
brought
back
altogether
about
twenty
specimens
of
various
kinds
of
rock
from
mount
betty
which
lies
in
lat
lieutenant
prestrud
expedition
to
king
edward
vii
land
collected
in
all
about
thirty
specimens
from
scott
nunatak
which
was
the
only
mountain
bare
of
snow
that
this
expedition
met
with
on
its
route
a
number
of
the
stones
from
scott
nunatak
were
brought
away
because
they
were
thickly
overgrown
with
lichens
these
specimens
of
lichens
have
been
sent
to
the
botanical
museum
of
the
university
a
first
cursory
examination
of
the
material
was
enough
to
show
that
the
specimens
from
mount
betty
and
scott
nunatak
consist
exclusively
of
granitic
rocks
and
crystalline
schists
there
were
no
specimens
of
sedimentary
rocks
which
by
possibly
containing
fossils
might
have
contributed
to
the
determination
of
the
age
of
these
mountains
another
thing
that
was
immediately
apparent
was
the
striking
agreement
that
exists
between
the
rocks
from
these
two
places
lying
so
far
apart
the
distance
from
mount
betty
to
scott
nunatak
is
between
seven
and
eight
degrees
of
latitude
i
have
examined
the
specimens
microscopically
from
mount
betty
there
are
several
specimens
of
white
granite
with
dark
and
light
mica
it
has
a
great
resemblance
to
the
white
granites
from
sogn
the
dovre
district
and
nordland
in
norway
there
is
one
very
beautiful
specimen
of
shining
white
granite
aplite
with
small
pale
red
garnets
these
granites
show
in
their
exterior
no
sign
of
pressure
structure
the
remaining
rocks
from
mount
betty
are
gneissic
granite
partly
very
rich
in
dark
mica
and
gneiss
granitic
schist
besides
mica
schist
with
veins
of
quartz
from
scott
nunatak
there
are
also
several
specimens
of
white
granite
very
like
those
from
mount
betty
the
remaining
rocks
from
here
are
richer
in
lime
and
iron
and
show
a
series
of
gradual
transitions
from
micacious
granite
through
to
quartz
diorite
with
considerable
quantities
of
dark
mica
and
green
hornblende
in
one
of
the
specimens
the
quantity
of
free
quartz
is
so
small
that
the
rock
is
almost
a
diorite
the
quartz
diorites
are
some
some
with
streaks
of
black
mica
the
schistose
rocks
from
scott
nunatak
are
streaked
and
in
part
very
quartz
diorite
schists
mica
schists
do
not
occur
among
the
specimens
from
this
mountain
our
knowledge
of
the
geology
of
south
victoria
land
is
mainly
due
to
scott
expedition
of
with
ferrar
as
geologist
and
shackleton
expedition
of
with
professor
david
and
priestley
as
geologists
according
to
the
investigations
of
these
expeditions
south
victoria
land
consists
of
a
vast
ancient
complex
of
crystalline
schists
and
granitic
rocks
large
extents
of
which
are
covered
by
a
sandstone
formation
beacon
sandstone
ferrar
on
the
whole
horizontally
bedded
which
is
at
least
feet
thick
and
in
which
shackleton
found
seams
of
coal
and
fossil
wood
a
coniferous
tree
this
as
it
belongs
to
the
upper
devonian
or
lower
carboniferous
determines
a
lower
limit
for
the
age
of
the
sandstone
formation
shackleton
also
found
in
lat
beds
of
limestone
which
he
regards
as
underlying
and
being
older
than
the
sandstone
in
the
limestone
which
is
also
on
the
whole
horizontally
bedded
only
radiolaria
have
been
found
the
limestone
is
probably
of
older
palæozoic
age
silurian
it
is
therefore
tolerably
certain
that
the
underlying
older
formation
of
gneisses
crystalline
schists
and
granites
is
of
archæan
age
and
belongs
to
the
foundation
rocks
volcanic
rocks
are
only
found
along
the
coast
of
ross
sea
and
on
a
range
of
islands
parallel
to
the
coast
shackleton
did
not
find
volcanic
rocks
on
his
ascent
from
the
barrier
on
his
route
towards
the
south
pole
prior
who
has
described
the
rocks
collected
by
expedition
gives
the
following
as
belonging
to
the
complex
of
foundation
rocks
gneisses
granites
diorites
banatites
and
other
eruptive
rocks
as
well
as
crystalline
limestone
with
chondrodite
professor
david
and
priestley
the
geologists
of
shackleton
expedition
refer
to
ferrar
and
prior
description
of
the
foundation
rocks
and
state
that
according
to
their
own
investigations
the
foundation
rocks
consist
of
banded
gneiss
gneissic
granite
and
diorite
rich
in
sphene
besides
coarse
crystalline
limestone
as
enclosures
in
the
gneiss
this
list
of
the
most
important
rocks
belonging
to
the
foundation
series
of
the
parts
of
south
victoria
land
already
explored
agrees
so
closely
with
the
rocks
from
mount
betty
and
scott
nunatak
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
latter
also
belong
to
the
foundation
rocks
from
the
exhaustive
investigations
carried
out
by
scott
and
shackleton
expeditions
it
appears
that
south
victoria
land
is
a
plateau
land
consisting
of
a
foundation
platform
of
great
thickness
and
prominence
above
which
lie
remains
of
greater
or
less
extent
of
palæozoic
formations
horizontally
bedded
from
the
specimens
of
rock
brought
home
by
roald
amundsen
expedition
it
is
established
that
the
plateau
of
foundation
rocks
is
continued
eastward
to
route
to
the
south
pole
and
that
king
edward

is
probably
a

to
get
him
to
undertake
this

while
indicating
the

which
the

then
had
calculated
the
astronomical
observations
from

from

i
knew
by

that

painstaking

that
he
also

at
your
request
i
shall
here
give
briefly
the
result
of
my
examination
of
the
observations
from
your
south
pole
expedition
my
calculations
are
based
on
the
longitude
for
framheim
given
to
me
by
lieutenant
prestrud
of
greenwich
he
describes
this
longitude
as
provisional
but
only
to
such
an
extent
that
the
final
result
can
not
differ
appreciably
from
it
my
own
results
may
also
be
somewhat
modified
on
a
final
treatment
of
the
material
but
these
modifications
again
will
only
be
immaterial
and
in
any
case
will
not
affect
the
result
of
the
investigations
given
below
as
to
the
position
of
the
two
polar
stations
at
the
first
polar
station
on
december
eighteen
altitudes
of
the
sun
were
taken
in
all
with
each
of
the
expedition
sextants
the
latitude
calculated
from
these
altitudes
is
on
an
average
of
both
sextants
very
near
with
a
mean
error
of
the
longitude
calculated
from
the
altitudes
is
about
but
as
might
be
expected
in
this
high
latitude
the
aberrations
are
very
considerable
we
may
however
assume
with
great
certainty
that
this
station
lies
between
lat
and
and
between
long
and
the
variation
of
the
compass
at
the
first
polar
station
was
determined
by
a
series
of
bearings
of
the
sun
this
gives
us
the
absolute
direction
of
the
last
day
line
of
route
the
length
of
this
line
was
measured
as
five
and
a
half
geographical
miles
with
the
help
of
this
we
are
able
to
construct
for
polheim
a
field
of
the
same
form
and
extent
as
that
within
which
the
first
polar
station
must
lie
at
polheim
during
a
period
of
hours
december
observations
were
taken
every
hour
with
one
of
the
sextants
the
observations
show
an
upper
culmination
altitude
of
and
a
resulting
lower
culmination
altitude
of
these
combining
the
above
two
altitudes
an
equal
error
on
the
same
side
in
each
will
have
no
influence
on
the
result
the
combination
gives
a
latitude
of
that
this
result
must
be
nearly
correct
is
confirmed
by
the
considerable
displacement
of
the
periods
of
culmination
which
is
indicated
by
the
series
of
observations
and
which
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
pole
is
caused
by
the
change
in
the
sun
declination
on
the
day
of
the
observations
this
displacement
amounted
to
thirty
minutes
in
minutes
in
and
over
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
upper
culmination
occurred
so
much
too
late
and
the
lower
culmination
so
much
too
early
the
interval
between
these
two
periods
was
thus
diminished
by
double
the
amount
of
the
displacements
given
now
the
series
of
observations
shows
that
the
interval
between
the
upper
and
the
lower
culmination
amounted
at
the
most
to
eleven
hours
the
displacement
of
the
periods
of
culmination
was
thus
at
least
half
an
hour
it
results
that
polheim
must
lie
south
of
while
at
the
same
time
we
may
assume
that
it
can
not
lie
south
of
the
moments
of
culmination
could
of
course
only
be
determined
very
approximately
and
in
the
same
way
the
observations
as
a
whole
are
unserviceable
for
the
determination
of
longitude
it
may
however
be
stated
with
some
certainty
that
the
longitude
must
be
between
and
the
latitude
as
already
mentioned
is
between
and
and
the
probable
position
of
polheim
may
be
given
roughly
as
lat
and
long
on
the
accompanying
the
letters

and
l
the
resulting
position
of

the
position
thus
assigned
to
the
latter
agrees
as
well
as
could
be
expected
with
the
average
result
of
the
observations
of
december
according
to
this
polheim
would
be
assumed
to
lie
one
and
a
half
geographical
miles
or
barely
three
kilometres
from
the
south
pole
and
certainly
not
so
much
as
six
kilometres
from
it
from
your
verbal
statement
i
learn
that
helmer
hanssen
and
bjaaland
walked
four
geographical
miles
from

the
direction
taken
to
be
south
on
the
basis
of

observations
on
the
chart
the
letters
efgh
give
the
field
within
which
the
termination
of
their
line
of
route
must
lie
it
will
be
seen
from
this
that
they
passed
the
south
pole
at
a
distance
which
on
the
one
hand
can
hardly
have
been
so
great
as
two
and
a
half
kilometres
and
on
the
other
hardly
so
great
as
two
kilometres
that
if
the
assumed
position
of
polheim
be
correct
they
passed
the
actual
pole
at
a
distance
of
between
and
metres
and
that
it
is
very
probable
that
they
passed
the

at
a
distance
of
a
few
hundred
metres
perhaps
even
less

in
by
professor
björn
and
professor
fridtjof
nansen
in
the
earliest
ages
of
the
human
race
the
sea
formed
an
absolute
barrier
men
looked
out
upon
its
immense
surface
now
calm
and
bright
now
lashed
by
storms
and
always
mysteriously
attractive
but
they
could
not
grapple
with
it
then
they
learned
to
make
boats
at
first
small
simple
craft
which
could
only
be
used
when
the
sea
was
calm
but
by
degrees
the
boats
were
made
larger
and
more
perfect
so
that
they
could
venture
farther
out
and
weather
a
storm
if
it
came
in
antiquity
the
peoples
of
europe
accomplished
the
navigation
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
boldest
maritime
nation
was
able
to
sail
round
africa
and
find
the
way
to
india
by
sea
then
came
voyages
to
the
northern
waters
of
europe
and
far
back
in
the
middle
ages
enterprising
seamen
crossed
from
norway
to
iceland
and
greenland
and
the
part
of
north
america
they
sailed
straight
across
the
north
atlantic
and
were
thus
the
true
discoverers
of
that
ocean
even
in
antiquity
the
greek
geographers
had
assumed
that
the
greater
part
of
the
globe
was
covered
by
sea
but
it
was
not
till
the
beginning
of
the
modern
age
that
any
at
all
accurate
idea
arose
of
the
extent
of
the
earth
great
masses
of
water
the
knowledge
of
the
ocean
advanced
with
more
rapid
steps
than
ever
before
at
first
this
knowledge
only
extended
to
the
surface
the
comparative
area
of
oceans
their
principal
currents
and
the
general
distribution
of
temperature
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
maury
collected
all
that
was
known
and
drew
charts
of
the
currents
and
winds
for
the
assistance
of
navigation
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
scientific
study
of
the
oceanic
waters
at
that
time
the
conditions
below
the
surface
were
still
little
known
a

some
of

valuable
had
been
made
of
the

even
at
great

very
little

been
done
towards
investigating
the
physical
conditions
it
was
seen
however
that
there
was
here
a
great
field
for
research
and
that
there
were
great
and
important
problems
to
be
solved
and
then
half
a
century
ago
the
great
scientific
expeditions
began
which
have
brought
an
entire
new
world
to
our
knowledge
it
is
only
forty
years
since
the
challenger
sailed
on
the
first
great
exploration
of
the
oceans
although
during
these
forty
years
a
quantity
of
oceanographical
observations
has
been
collected
with
a
constant
improvement
of
methods
it
is
nevertheless
clear
that
our
knowledge
of
the
ocean
is
still
only
in
the
preliminary
stage
the
ocean
has
an
area
twice
as
great
as
that
of
the
dry
land
and
it
occupies
a
space
thirteen
times
as
great
as
that
occupied
by
the
land
above
apart
from
the
great
number
of
soundings
for
depth
alone
the
number
of
oceanographical
stations
with
a
series
of
physical
and
biological
observations
at
various
depths
is
very
small
in
proportion
to
the
vast
masses
of
water
and
there
are
still
extensive
regions
of
the
ocean
of
the
conditions
of
which
we
have
only
a
suspicion
but
no
certain
knowledge
this
applies
also
to
the
atlantic
ocean
and
especially
to
the
south
atlantic
scientific
exploration
of
the
ocean
has
several
objects
it
seeks
to
explain
the
conditions
governing
a
great
and
important
part
of
our
earth
and
to
discover
the
laws
that
control
the
immense
masses
of
water
in
the
ocean
it
aims
at
acquiring
a
knowledge
of
its
varied
fauna
and
flora
and
of
the
relations
between
this
infinity
of
organisms
and
the
medium
in
which
they
live
these
were
the
principal
problems
for
the
solution
of
which
the
voyage
of
the
challenger
and
other
scientific
expeditions
were
undertaken
maury
leading
object
was
to
explain
the
conditions
that
are
of
practical
importance
to
navigation
his
investigations
were
in
the
first
instance
applied
to
utilitarian
needs
but
the
physical
investigation
of
the
ocean
has
yet
another
very
important
bearing
the
difference
between
a
sea
climate
and
a
continental
climate
has
long
been
understood
it
has
long
been
known
that
the
sea
has
an
equalizing
effect
on
the
temperature
of
the
air
so
that
in
countries
lying
near
the
sea
there
is
not
so
great
a
difference
between
the
heat
of
summer
and
the
cold
of
winter
as
on
continents
far
from
the
it
has
also
long
been
understood
that
the
warm
currents
produce
a
comparatively
mild
climate
in
high
latitudes
and
that
the
cold
currents
coming
from
the
polar
regions
produce
a
low
temperature
it
has
been
known
for
centuries
that
the
northern
arm
of
the
gulf
stream
makes
northern
europe
as
habitable
as
it
is
and
that
the
polar
currents
on
the
shores
of
greenland
and
labrador
prevent
any
richer
development
of
civilization
in
these
regions
but
it
is
only
recently
that
modern
investigation
of
the
ocean
has
begun
to
show
the
intimate
interaction
between
sea
and
air
an
interaction
which
makes
it
probable
that
we
shall
be
able
to
forecast
the
main
variations
in
climate
from
year
to
year
as
soon
as
we
have
a
sufficiently
large
material
in
the
shape
of
soundings
in
order
to
provide
new
oceanographical
material
by
modern
methods
the
plan
of
the
fram
expedition
included
the
making
of
a
number
of
investigations
in
the
atlantic
ocean
in
june
the
fram
went
on
a
trial
cruise
in
the
north
atlantic
to
the
west
of
the
british
isles
altogether
stations
were
taken
in
this
region
during
june
and
july
before
the
fram
final
departure
from
norway
the
expedition
then
went
direct
to
the
antarctic
and
landed
the
shore
party
on
the
barrier
neither
on
this
trip
nor
on
the
fram
subsequent
voyage
to
buenos
aires
were
any
investigations
worth
mentioning
made
as
time
was
too
short
but
in
june
captain
nilsen
took
the
fram
on
a
cruise
in
the
south
atlantic
and
made
in
all
sixty
valuable
stations
along
two
lines
between
south
america
and
africa
an
exhaustive
working
out
of
the
very
considerable
material
collected
on
these
voyages
has
not
yet
been
possible
we
shall
here
only
attempt
to
set
forth
the
most
conspicuous
results
shown
by
a
preliminary
examination
besides
the
meteorological
observations
and
the
collection
of
plankton
in
fine
silk
the
investigations
consisted
of
taking
temperatures
and
samples
of
water
at
different
depths
the
temperatures
below
the
surface
were
ascertained
by
the
best
modern
reversing
thermometers
richter
these
thermometers
are
capable
of
giving
the
temperature
to
within
a
few
hundredths
of
a
degree
at
any
depth
samples
of
water
were
taken
for
the
most
part
with
reversing
it
consists
of
a
brass
tube
with
a
valve
at
each
end
when
it
is
lowered
the
valves
are
open
so
that
the
water
passes
freely
through
the
tube
when
the
apparatus
has
reached
the
depth
from
which
a
sample
is
to
be
taken
a
small
slipping
sinker
is
sent
down
along
the
line
when
the
sinker
strikes
the
sampler
it
displaces
a
small
pin
which
holds
the
brass
tube
in
the
position
in
which
the
valves
remain
open
the
tube
then
swings
over
and
this
closes
the
valves
so
that
the
tube
is
filled
with
a
hermetically
enclosed
sample
of
water
these
water
samples
were
put
into
small
bottles
which
were
afterwards
sent
to
bergen
where
the
salinity
of
each
sample
was
determined
on
the
first
cruise
in
june
and
july
the
observations
on
board
were
carried
out
by
adolf
schröer
besides
the
permanent
members
of
the
expedition
the
observations
in
the
south
atlantic
in
the
following
year
were
for
the
most
part
carried
out
by
lieutenant
gjertsen
and
kutschin
the
atlantic
ocean
is
traversed
by
a
series
of
main
currents
which
are
of
great
importance
on
account
of
their
powerful
influence
on
the
physical
conditions
of
the
surrounding
regions
of
sea
and
atmosphere
by
its
oceanographical
investigations
in
and
the
fram
expedition
has
made
important
contributions
to
our
knowledge
of
many
of
these
currents
we
shall
first
speak
of
the
investigations
in
the
north
atlantic
in
and
afterwards
of
those
in
the
south
atlantic
in
investigations
in
the
north
atlantic
in
june
and
july
the
waters
of
the
northern
atlantic
ocean
to
the
north
of
lats
and
are
to
a
great
extent
in
drifting
motion
and
eastward
from
the
american
to
the
european
side
this
drift
is
what
is
popularly
called
the
gulf
stream
to
the
west
of
the
bay
of
biscay
the
eastward
flow
of
water
divides
into
two
branches
one
going
and
southward
which
is
continued
in
the
canary
current
and
the
other
going
and
northward
outside
the
british
isles
which
sends
comparatively
warm
streams
of
water
both
in
the
direction
of
iceland
and
past
the
shetlands
and
faroes
into
the
norwegian
sea
and
along
the
west
coast
of
norway
this
last
arm
of
the
gulf
stream
in
the
norwegian
sea
has
been
well
explored
during
the
last
ten
or
fifteen
years
its
course
and
extent
have
been
charted
and
it
has
been
shown
to
be
subject
to
great
variations
from
year
to
year
which
again
appear
to
be
closely
connected
with
variations
in
the
development
and
habitat
of
several
important
species
of
fish
such
as
cod
haddock
as
well
as
with
variations
in
the
winter
climate
of
norway
the
crops
and
other
important
conditions
by
closely
following
the
changes
in
the
gulf
stream
from
year
to
year
it
looks
as
if
we
should
be
able
to
predict
a
long
time
in
advance
any
great
changes
in
the
cod
and
haddock
fisheries
in
the
north
sea
as
well
as
variations
in
the
winter
climate
of
europe
but
the
cause
or
causes
of
these
variations
in
the
gulf
stream
are
at
present
unknown
in
order
to
solve
this
difficult
question
we
must
be
acquainted
with
the
conditions
in
those
regions
of
the
atlantic
itself
through
which
this
mighty
ocean
current
flows
before
it
sends
its
waters
into
the
norwegian
sea
but
here
we
are
met
by
the
difficulty
that
the
investigations
that
have
been
made
hitherto
are
extremely
inadequate
and
deficient
indeed
we
have
no
accurate
fig
hypothetical
representation
of
the
surface
currents
in
the
northern
atlantic
in
april
after
nansen

the
internationale
revue
der
gesamten
hydrobiologie
and
hydrographie
knowledge
even
of
the
course
and
extent
of
the
current
in
this
ocean
a
thorough
investigation
of
it
with
the
improved
methods
of
our
time
is
therefore
an
inevitable
necessity
as
the
gulf
stream
is
of
so
great
importance
to
northern
europe
in
general
but
especially
to
us
norwegians
it
was
not
a
mere
accident
that
three
separate
expeditions
left
norway
in
the
same
year

and
hjort
expedition
in
the
michael
sars
amundsen
trial

fram
and
nansen
voyage
in
the
gunboat
frithjof
all
with
the
object
of
investigating
the
conditions
in
the
north
atlantic
the
fact
that
on
these
three
voyages
observations
were
made
approximately
at
the
same
time
in
different
parts
of
the
ocean
increases
their
value
in
a
great
degree
since
they
can
thus
be
directly
compared
we
are
thus
able
to
obtain
for
instance
a
reliable
survey
of
the
distribution
of
temperature
and
salinity
and
to
draw
important
conclusions
as
to
the
extent
of
the
currents

two

have

high

a

volume
of

with

somewhat
lower
salinity
is
found
again
in
the
section
which
was
taken
a
few
weeks
later
by
the
frithjof
from
ireland
to
the
across
the
rockall
bank
this
volume
of
water
has
a
special
interest
for
us
since
as
will
be
mentioned
later
it
forms
the
main
part
of
that
arm
of
the
gulf
stream
which
enters
the
norwegian
sea
but
which
is
gradually
cooled
on
its
way
and
mixed
with
fresher
water
so
that
its
salinity
is
constantly
decreasing
this
fresher
water
is
evidently
derived
in
great
measure
directly
from
precipitation
which
is
here
in
excess
of
the
evaporation
from
the
surface
of
the
sea
the
volume
of
gulf
stream
water
that
is
seen
in
the
eastern
part
east
of
station
of
the
southern
fram
section
can
only
flow
to
a
much
less
extent
as
the
porcupine
bank
is
connected
with
the
bank
to
the
west
of
ireland
by
a
submarine
ridge
with
depths
up
to
about
metres
which
forms
a
great
obstacle
to
such
a
movement
the
two
volumes
of
gulf
stream
water
in
the
fram
southern
section
of
are
divided
by
a
volume
of
water
which
lies
over
the
porcupine
bank
and
has
a
lower
salinity
and
also
a
somewhat
lower
average
temperature
on
the
bank
to
the
south
of
ireland
stations
and
the
salinity
and
average
temperature
are
also
comparatively
low
the
fact
that
the
water
on
the
banks
off
the
coast
has
lower
salinities
and
in
part
lower
temperatures
than
the
water
outside
in
the
deep
sea
has
usually
been
explained
by
its
being
mixed
with
the
coast
water
which
is
diluted
with
river
water
from
the
land
this
explanation
may
be
correct
in
a
great
measure
but
of
course
it
will
not
apply
to
the
water
over
banks
that
lie
out
in
the
sea
far
from
any
land
it
appears
nevertheless
on
the
porcupine
bank
for
instance
and
as
we
shall
see
later
on
the
rockall
bank
that
the
water
on
these
ocean
banks
is
in
any
case
in
early
summer
colder
and
less
salt
than
the
surrounding
water
of
the
sea
it
appears
from
the
frithjof
section
across
the
rockall
bank
as
well
as
from
the
two
fram
sections
that
this
must
be
due
to
precipitation
combined
with
the
vertical
currents
near
the
surface
which
are
produced
by
the
cooling
of
the
surface
of
the
sea
in
the
course
of
the
winter
for
as
the
surface
water
cools
it
becomes
heavier
than
the
water
immediately
below
and
must
then
sink
while
it
is
replaced
by
water
from
below
these
vertical
currents
extend
deeper
and
deeper
as
the
cooling
proceeds
in
the
course
of
the
winter
and
bring
about
an
almost
equal
temperature
and
salinity
in
the
upper
waters
of
the
sea
during
the
winter
as
far
down
as
this
vertical
circulation
reaches
but
as
the
precipitation
in
these
regions
is
constantly
decreasing
the
salinity
of
the
surface
water
this
vertical
circulation
must
bring
about
a
diminution
of
salinity
in
the
underlying
waters
with
which
the
sinking
surface
water
is
mixed
into
a
homogeneous
volume
of
water
the
frithjof
section
in
particular
seems
to
show
that
the
vertical
circulation
in
these
regions
reaches
to
a
depth
of
or
metres
at
the
close
of
the
winter
if
we
consider
then
what
must
happen
over
a
bank
in
the
ocean
where
the
depth
is
less
than
this
it
is
obvious
that
the
vertical
circulation
will
here
be
prevented
by
the
bottom
from
reaching
the
depth
it
otherwise
would
and
there
will
be
a
smaller
volume
of
water
to
take
part
in
this
circulation
and
to
be
mixed
with
the
cooled
and
diluted
surface
water
but
as
the
cooling
of
the
surface
and
the
precipitation
are
the
same
there
as
in
the
surrounding
regions
the
consequence
must
be
that
the
whole
of
this
volume
of
water
over
the
bank
will
be
colder
and
less
salt
than
the
surrounding
waters
and
as
this
bank
water
on
account
of
its
lower
temperature
is
heavier
than
the
water
of
the
surrounding
sea
it
will
have
a
tendency
to
spread
itself
outwards
along
the
bottom
and
to
sink
down
along
the
slopes
from
the
sides
of
the
bank
this
obviously
contributes
to
increase
the
opposition
that
such
banks
offer
to
the
advance
of
ocean
currents
even
when
they
lie
fairly
deep
these
conditions
which
in
many
respects
are
of
great
importance
are
clearly
shown
in
the
two
fram
sections
and
the
frithjof
section
the
northern
fram
section
went
from
a
point
to
the
of
the
rockall
bank
station
across
the
northern
end
of
this
bank
station
and
across
the
northern
part
of
the
wide
channel
rockall
channel
between
it
and
scotland
as
might
be
expected
both
temperature
and
salinity
are
lower
in
this
section
than
in
the
southern
one
since
in
the
course
of
their
slow
northward
movement
the
waters
are
cooled
especially
by
the
vertical
circulation
in
winter
already
mentioned
and
are
mixed
with
water
containing
less
salt
especially
precipitated
water
while
in
the
southern
section
the
isotherm
for
went
down
to
metres
it
here
lies
at
a
depth
of
between
and
metres
in
the
comparatively
short
distance
between
the
two
sections
the
whole
volume
of
water
has
been
cooled
between
and
this
represents
a
great
quantity
of
warmth
and
it
is
chiefly
given
off
to
the
air
which
is
thus
warmed
over
a
great
area
water
contains
more
than
times
as
much
warmth
as
the
same
volume
of
air
at
the
same
temperature
for
example
if
cubic
metre
of
water
is
cooled
and
the
whole
quantity
of
warmth
thus
taken
from
the
water
is
given
fig
temperature
and
salinity
in
the
fram
northern
section
july
to
the
air
it
is
sufficient
to
warm
more
than
cubic
metres
of
air
when
subjected
to
the
pressure
of
one
atmosphere
in
other
words
if
the
surface
water
of
a
region
of
the
sea
is
cooled
to
a
depth
of
metre
the
quantity
of
warmth
thus
taken
from
the
sea
is
sufficient
to
warm
the
air
of
the
same
region
up
to
a
height
of
much
more
than
metres
since
at
high
altitudes
the
air
is
subjected
to
less
pressure
and
consequently
a
cubic
metre
there
contains
less
air
than
at
the
but
it
is
not
a
depth
of
metre
of
the
gulf
stream
that
has
been
cooled
between
these
two
sections
it
is
a
depth
of
about
metres
or
more
and
it
has
been
cooled
between
and
it
will
thus
be
easily
understood
that
this
loss
of
warmth
from
the
gulf
stream
must
have
a
profound
influence
on
the
temperature
of
the
air
over
a
wide
area
we
see
how
it
comes
about
that
warm
currents
like
this
are
capable
of
rendering
the
climate
of
countries
so
much
milder
as
is
the
case
in
europe
and
we
see
further
how
comparatively
slight
variations
in
the
temperature
of
the
current
from
year
to
year
must
bring
about
considerable
variations
in
the
climate
and
how
we
must
be
in
a
position
to
predict
these
latter
changes
when
the
temperature
of
the
currents
becomes
the
object
of
extensive
and
continuous
investigation
it
may
be
hoped
that
this
is
enough
to
show
that
problems
are
here
in
question
the
salinity
of
the
gulf
stream
water
decreases
considerably
between
the
fram
southern
and
northern
sections
while
in
the
former
it
was
in
great
part
between
and
per
mille
in
the
latter
it
is
throughout
not
much
more
than
per
mille
in
this
section
also
the
waters
of
the
gulf
stream
are
divided
by
an
accumulation
of
less
salt
and
somewhat
colder
bank
water
which
here
lies
over
the
rockall
bank
station
on
the
west
side
of
this
bank
there
is
again
station
salter
and
warmer
gulf
stream
water
though
not
quite
so
warm
as
on
the
east
from
the
frithjof
section
a
little
farther
south
it
appears
that
this
western
volume
of
gulf
stream
water
is
comparatively
small
the
investigations
of
the
fram
and
the
frithjof
show
that
the
part
of
the
gulf
stream
which
penetrates
into
the
norwegian
sea
comes
in
the
main
through
the
rockall
channel
between
the
rockall
bank
and
the
bank
to
the
west
of
the
british
isles
its
width
in
this
region
is
thus
considerably
less
than
was
usually
supposed
evidently
this
is
largely
due
to
the
influence
of
the
earth
rotation
whereby
currents
in
the
northern
hemisphere
are
deflected
to
the
right
to
a
greater
degree
the
farther
north
they
run
in
this
way
the
ocean
currents
especially
in
northern
latitudes
are
forced
against
banks
and
coasts
lying
to
the
right
of
them
and
frequently
follow
the
edges
where
the
coast
banks
slope
down
to
the
deep
the
conclusion
given
above
that
the
gulf
stream
comes
through
the
rockall
channel
is
of
importance
to
future
investigations
it
shows
that
an
annual
investigation
of
the
water
of
this
channel
would
certainly
contribute
in
a
valuable
way
to
the
understanding
of
the
variations
of
the
climate
of
western
europe
we
shall
not
dwell
at
greater
length
here
on
the
results
of
the
oceanographical
investigations
in
only
when
the
observations
then
collected
as
well
as
those
of
the
frithjof
and
michael
voyages
have
been
fully
worked
out
shall
we
be
able
to
make
a
complete
survey
of
what
has
been
accomplished
investigations
in
the
south
atlantic
june
to
august
in
the
south
atlantic
we
have
the
southward
brazil
current
on
the
american
side
and
the
northward
benguela
current
on
the
african
side
in
the
southern
part
of
the
ocean
there
is
a
wide
current
flowing
from
west
to
east
in
the
west
wind
belt
and
in
its
northern
part
immediately
south
of
the
equator
the
south
equatorial
current
flows
from
east
to
west
we
have
thus
in
the
south
atlantic
a
vast
circle
of
currents
with
a
motion
contrary
to
that
of
the
hands
of
a
clock
the
fram
expedition
has
now
made
two
full
sections
across
the
central
part
of
the
south
atlantic
these
sections
take
in
both
the
brazil
current
and
the
benguela
current
and
they
lie
between
the
eastward
current
on
the
south
and
the
westward
current
on
the
north
this
is
the
first
time
that
such
complete
sections
have
been
obtained
between
south
america
and
africa
in
this
part
of
the
ocean
and
no
doubt
a
larger
number
of
stations
were
taken
on
the
fram
voyage
than
have
been
taken
with
the
same
amount
of
detail
in
the
whole
south
atlantic
by
all
previous
expeditions
put
together
when
the
fram
left
buenos
aires
in
june
the
expedition
went
eastward
through
the
brazil
current
the
first
station
was
taken
in
lat
and
long
this
was
on
june
her
course
was
then
or
east
until
station
in
lat
and
long
this
station
lay
in
the
benguela
current
about
miles
from
the
coast
of
africa
and
it
was
taken
on
july
from
there
she
went
in
a
gentle
curve
fig
and
caption
past
helena
and
trinidad
back
to
america
the
last
station
no
was
taken
on
august
in
the
brazil
current
in
lat
and
about
long
this
station
lay
about
miles
of
rio
de
janeiro
there
was
an
average
distance
of
nautical
miles
between
one
station
and
the
next
at
nearly
all
the
stations
investigations
were
made
at
the
following
depths
surface
and
metres
and
fathoms
at
one
or
two
of
the
stations
observations
were
also
taken
at
and
metres
and
fathoms
the
investigations
were
thus
carried
out
from
about
the
middle
of
july
to
the
middle
of
august
in
that
part
of
the
southern
winter
which
corresponds
to
the
period
between
the
middle
of
fig
fig
currents
in
the
south
atlantic
june
august
december
and
the
middle
of
february
in
the
northern
hemisphere
we
must
first
see
what
the
conditions
were
on
the
surface
in
those
regions
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
of
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
currents
on
the
two
sides
of
the
ocean
flow
in
opposite
directions
along
the
coast
of
africa
we
have
the
benguela
current
flowing
from
south
to
north
on
the
american
side
the
brazil
current
flows
from
the
tropics
southward
the
former
current
is
therefore
comparatively
cold
and
the
latter
comparatively
warm
this
is
clearly
seen
on
the
chart
which
shows
the
distribution
of
temperatures
and
salinities
on
the
surface
in
lat
it
was
only
about
off
the
african
coast
while
it
was
about
off
the
coast
of
brazil
the
salinity
depends
on
the
relation
between
evaporation
and
the
addition
of
fresh
water
the
benguela
current
comes
from
fig
fig
salinities
and
temperatures
at
the
surface
in
the
south
atlantic
june
august
regions
where
the
salinity
is
comparatively
low
this
is
due
to
the
acquisition
of
fresh
water
in
the
antarctic
ocean
where
the
evaporation
from
the
surface
is
small
and
the
precipitation
comparatively
large
a
part
of
this
fresh
water
is
also
acquired
by
the
sea
in
the
form
of
icebergs
from
the
antarctic
continent
these
icebergs
melt
as
they
drift
about
the
sea
immediately
off
the
african
coast
there
is
a
belt
where
the
salinity
is
under
per
mille
on
the
surface
farther
out
in
the
benguela
current
the
salinity
is
for
the
most
part
between
and
per
mille
as
the
water
is
carried
northward
by
the
current
evaporation
becomes
greater
and
greater
the
air
becomes
comparatively
warm
and
dry
thereby
the
salinity
is
raised
the
benguela
current
is
then
continued
westward
in
the
south
equatorial
current
a
part
of
this
afterwards
turns
to
the
and
crosses
the
equator
into
the
north
atlantic
where
it
joins
the
north
equatorial
current
this
part
must
thus
pass
through
the
belt
of
calms
in
the
tropics
in
this
region
falls
of
rain
occur
heavy
enough
to
decrease
the
surface
salinity
again
but
the
other
part
of
the
south
equatorial
current
turns
southward
along
the
coast
of
brazil
and
is
then
given
the
name
of
the
brazil
current
the
volume
of
water
that
passes
this
way
receives
at
first
only
small
additions
of
precipitation
the
air
is
so
dry
and
warm
in
this
region
that
the
salinity
on
the
surface
rises
to
over
per
mille
this
will
be
clearly
seen
on
the
chart
the
saltest
water
in
the
whole
south
atlantic
is
found
in
the
northern
part
of
the
brazil
current
farther
to
the
south
in
this
current
the
salinity
decreases
again
as
the
water
is
there
mixed
with
fresher
water
from
the
south
the
river
la
plata
sends
out
enormous
quantities
of
fresh
water
into
the
ocean
most
of
this
goes
northward
on
account
of
the
rotation
the
effect
of
this
is
of
course
to
deflect
the
currents
of
the
southern
hemisphere
to
the
left
and
those
of
the
northern
hemisphere
to
the
right
besides
the
water
from
the
river
la
plata
there
is
a
current
flowing
northward
along
the
coast
of
patagonia
namely
the
falkland
current
like
the
benguela
current
it
brings
water
with
lower
salinities
than
those
of
the
waters
farther
north
therefore
in
proportion
as
the
salt
water
of
the
brazil
current
is
mixed
with
the
water
from
the
river
la
plata
and
the
falkland
current
its
salinity
decreases
these
various
conditions
give
the
explanation
of
the
distribution
of
salinity
and
temperature
that
is
seen
in
the
chart
between
the
two
long
lines
of
section
there
is
a
distance
of
between
ten
and
fifteen
degrees
of
latitude
there
is
therefore
a
considerable
difference
in
temperature
in
the
southern
section
the
average
surface
temperature
at
stations
to
june
to
july
was
in
the
northern
section
at
stations
to
july
to
august
it
was
there
was
thus
a
difference
of
if
all
the
stations
had
been
taken
simultaneously
the
difference
would
have
been
somewhat
greater
the
northern
section
was
of
course
taken
later
in
the
winter
and
the
temperatures
were
therefore
proportionally
lower
than
in
the
southern
section
the
difference
corresponds
fairly
accurately
with
that
which
kr
ummel
has
calculated
from
previous
observations
we
must
now
look
at
the
conditions
below
the
surface
in
that
part
of
the
south
atlantic
which
was
investigated
by
the
fram
expedition
the
observations
show
in
the
first
place
that
both
temperatures
and
salinities
at
every
one
of
the
stations
give
the
same
values
from
the
surface
downward
to
somewhere
between
and
metres
and
fathoms
this
equalization
of
temperature
and
salinity
is
due
to
the
vertical
currents
produced
by
cooling
in
winter
we
shall
return
to
it
later
but
below
these
depths
the
temperatures
and
salinities
decrease
rather
rapidly
for
some
distance
the
conditions
of
temperature
at
metres
fathoms
below
the
surface
are
shown
in
the
next
little
chart
this
chart
is
based
on
the
fram
expedition
and
as
regards
the
other
parts
of
the
ocean
on
schott
comparison
of
the
results
of
previous
expeditions
it
will
be
seen
that
the
fram
observations
agree
very
well
with
previous
soundings
but
are
much
more
detailed
the
chart
shows
clearly
that
it
is
much
warmer
at
metres
fathoms
in
the
central
part
of
the
south
atlantic
than
either
farther
north
nearer
the
equator
or
farther
south
on
the
equator
there
is
a
fairly
large
area
where
the
temperature
is
only
or
at
metres
whereas
in
lats
to
there
are
large
regions
where
it
is
above
sometimes
above
or
even
south
of
lat
the
temperature
decreases
again
rapidly
in
the
chart
no
lines
are
drawn
for
temperatures
below
as
we
have
not
sufficient
observations
to
show
the
course
of
these
lines
properly
but
we
know
that
the
temperature
at
metres
sinks
to
about
in
the
antarctic
ocean
fig
fig
temperatures
centigrade
at
a
depth
of
metres
fathoms
at
these
depths
then
we
find
the
warmest
water
within
the
region
investigated
by
the
fram
if
we
now
compare
the
distribution
of
temperature
at
metres
with
the
chart
of
currents
in
the
south
atlantic
we
see
that
the
warm
region
lies
in
the
centre
of
the
great
circulation
of
which
mention
was
made
above
we
see
that
there
are
high
temperatures
on
the
side
of
the
currents
and
low
on
the
side
this
again
is
an
effect
of
the
earth
rotation
for
the
high
temperatures
mean
as
a
rule
that
the
water
is
comparatively
light
and
the
low
that
it
is
comparatively
heavy
now
the
effect
of
the
earth
rotation
in
the
southern
hemisphere
is
that
the
light
warm
water
from
above
is
forced
somewhat
down
on
the
side
of
the
current
and
that
the
heavy
cold
water
from
below
is
raised
somewhat
in
the
northern
hemisphere
the
contrary
is
the
case
this
explains
the
cold
water
at
a
depth
of
metres
on
the
equator
it
also
explains
the
fact
that
the
water
immediately
off
the
coasts
of
africa
and
south
america
is
considerably
colder
than
farther
out
in
the
ocean
we
now
have
data
for
studying
the
relation
between
the
currents
and
the
distribution
of
warmth
in
the
volumes
of
water
in
a
way
which
affords
valuable
information
as
to
the
movements
themselves
the
material
collected
by
the
fram
will
doubtless
be
of
considerable
importance
in
this
way
when
it
has
been
finally
worked
out
below
metres
fathoms
the
temperature
further
decreases
everywhere
in
the
south
atlantic
at
first
rapidly
to
a
depth
between
and
metres
and
fathoms
afterwards
very
slowly
it
is
possible
however
that
at
the
greatest
depths
it
rises
a
little
again
but
this
will
only
be
a
question
of
hundredths
or
in
any
case
very
few
tenths
of
a
degree
it
is
known
from
previous
investigations
in
the
south
atlantic
that
the
waters
at
the
greatest
depths
several
thousand
metres
below
the
surface
have
a
temperature
of
between
and
along
the
whole
atlantic
from
the
extreme
north
near
iceland
to
the
extreme
south
there
runs
a
ridge
about
between
europe
and
africa
on
the
one
side
and
the
two
american
continents
on
the
other
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
equator
there
is
a
slight
elevation
across
the
ocean
floor
between
south
america
and
africa
farther
south
between
lats
and
another
irregular
ridge
runs
across
between
these
continents
we
therefore
have
four
deep
regions
in
the
south
atlantic
two
on
the
west
the
brazilian
deep
and
the
argentine
deep
and
two
on
the
east
the
west
african
deep
and
the
south
african
deep
now
it
has
been
found
that
the
bottom
water
in
these
great
deeps
the
bottom
lies
more
than
metres
fathoms
below
the
surface
is
not
always
the
same
in
the
two
western
deeps
off
south
america
the
temperature
is
only
a
little
above
we
find
about
the
same
temperatures
in
the
south
african
deep
and
farther
eastward
in
a
belt
that
is
continued
round
the
whole
earth
to
the
south
between
this
belt
and
antarctica
the
temperature
of
the
great
deeps
is
much
lower
below
but
in
the
west
african
deep
the
temperature
is
about
higher
we
find
there
the
same
temperatures
of
between
and
as
are
found
everywhere
in
the
deepest
parts
of
the
north
atlantic
the
explanation
of
this
must
be
that
the
bottom
water
in
the
western
part
of
the
south
atlantic
comes
from
the
south
while
in
the
part
it
comes
from
the
north
this
is
connected
with
the
earth
rotation
which
has
a
tendency
to
deflect
currents
to
the
left
in
the
southern
hemisphere
the
bottom
water
coming
from
the
south
goes
to
the
left
that
is
to
the
south
american
side
that
which
comes
from
the
north
also
goes
to
the
left
that
is
to
the
african
side
the
salinity
also
decreases
from
the
surface
downward
to
to
metres
about
to
fathoms
where
it
is
only
a
little
over
per
mille
but
under
per
mille
lower
down
it
rises
to
about
per
mille
in
the
bottom
water
that
comes
from
the
south
and
to
about
per
mille
in
that
which
comes
from
the
north
atlantic
we
mentioned
that
the
benguela
current
is
colder
and
less
salt
at
the
surface
than
the
brazil
current
the
same
thing
is
found
in
those
parts
of
the
currents
that
lie
below
the
surface
this
is
clearly
shown
in
fig
which
gives
the
distribution
of
temperature
at
station
in
the
benguela
current
and
at
station
in
the
brazil
current
at
the
various
depths
down
to
metres
fathoms
it
was
between
and
colder
in
the
former
than
in
the
latter
deeper
down
the
difference
becomes
less
and
at
metres
fathoms
there
was
only
a
difference
of
one
or
two
tenths
of
a
degree
fig
shows
a
corresponding
difference
in
salinities
in
the
first
metres
below
the
surface
the

was
about

at

and
at

in
the

august
per
mille
more
saline
in
the
brazil
current
than
in
the
benguela
current
both
these
currents
are
confined
to
the
upper
waters
the
former
probably
goes
down
to
a
depth
of
about
metres
fathoms
while
the
latter
does
not
reach
a
depth
of
much
more
than
metres
below
the
two
currents
the
conditions
are
fairly
homogeneous
and
there
is
no
difference
worth
mentioning
in
the
salinities
the
conditions
between
the
surface
and
a
depth
of
metres
along
the
two
main
lines
of
course
are
clearly
shown
in
the
two
sections
figs
and
in
these
the
isotherms
for
every
second
degree
are
drawn
in
broken
lines

of
figures
giving
the
numbers
of
the

to

and
caption
the
sections
rightly
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
vertical
scale
is
times
greater
than
the
horizontal
many
of
the
conditions
we
have
already
mentioned
are
clearly
apparent
in
the
sections
the
small
variations
between
the
surface
and
a
depth
of
about
metres
at
each
station
the
decrease
of
temperature
and
salinity
as
the
depth
increases
the
high
values
both
of
temperature
and
salinity
in
the
western
part
as
compared
with
the
eastern
we
see
from
the
sections
how
nearly
the
isotherms
and
isohalins
follow
each
other
thus
where
the
temperature
is
the
water
almost
invariably
has
a
salinity
very
near
per
mille
this
water
at
with
a
salinity
of
per
mille
is
found
in
the
western
part
of
the
area
in
the
brazil
current
at
a
depth
of
to
metres
but
in
the
eastern
part
in
the
benguela
current
no
deeper
than
to
metres
to
fathoms
we
see
further
in
both
sections
and
especially
in
the
southern
one
that
the
isotherms
and
isohalins
often
have
an
undulating
course
since
the
conditions
at
one
station
may
be
different
from
those
at
the
neighbouring
stations
to
point
to
one
or
two
examples
at
station
the
water
a
few
hundred
metres
down
was
comparatively
warm
it
was
for
instance
at
about
metres
fathoms
at
this
station
while
the
same
temperature
was
found
at
about
metres
fathoms
at
both
the
neighbouring
stations
and
at
station
it
was
relatively
cold
as
cold
as
it
was
a
few
hundred
metres
deeper
down
at
stations
and
these
undulating
curves
of
the
isotherms
and
isohalins
are
familiar
to
us
in
the
norwegian
sea
where
they
have
been
shown
in
most
sections
taken
in
recent
years
they
may
be
explained
in
more
than
one
way
they
may
be
due
to
actual
waves
which
are
transmitted
through
the
central
waters
of
the
sea
many
things
go
to
show
that
such
waves
may
actually
occur
far
below
the
surface
in
which
case
they
must
attain
great
dimensions
they
must
indeed
be
more
than
metres
high
at
times
and
yet
fortunately
they
are
not
felt
on
the
surface
in
the
norwegian
sea
we
have
frequently
found
these
rises
and
falls
or
the
curves
may
be
due
to
differences
in
the
rapidity
and
direction
of
the
currents
here
the
earth
rotation
comes
into
play
since
as
mentioned
above
it
causes
zones
of
water
to
be
depressed
on
one
side
and
raised
on
the
other
and
the
degree
of
force
with
which
this
takes
place
is
dependent
on
the
rapidity
of
the
current
and
on
the
geographical
latitude
the
effect
is
slight
in
the
tropics
but
great
in
high
latitudes
this
so
far
as
it
goes
agrees
with
the
fig
and
captions
fact
that
the
curves
of
the
isotherms
and
isohalins
are
more
marked
in
the
more
southerly
of
our
two
sections
than
in
the
more
northerly
one
which
lies
or
degrees
nearer
the
equator
but
the
probability
is
that
the
curves
are
due
to
the
formation
of
eddies
in
the
currents
in
an
eddy
the
light
and
warm
water
will
be
depressed
to
greater
depths
if
the
eddy
goes
contrary
to
the
hands
of
a
clock
and
is
situated
in
the
southern
hemisphere
we
appear
to
have
such
an
eddy
around
station
for
example
around
station
an
eddy
appears
to
be
going
the
other
way
that
is
the
same
way
as
the
hands
of
a
clock
on
the
chart
of
currents
we
have
indicated
some
of
these
eddies
from
the
observations
of
the
distribution
of
salinity
and
temperature
made
by
the
fram
expedition
while
this
then
is
the
probable
explanation
of
the
irregularities
shown
by
the
lines
of
the
sections
it
is
not
impossible
that
they
may
be
due
to
other
conditions
such
as
for
instance
the
submarine
waves
alluded
to
above
another
possibility
is
that
they
may
be
a
consequence
of
variations
in
the
rapidity
of
the
current
produced
for
instance
by
wind
the
periodical
variations
caused
by
the
tides
will
hardly
be
an
adequate
explanation
of
what
happens
here
although
during
murray
and
hjort
atlantic
expedition
in
the
michael
sars
in
and
recently
during
nansen
voyage
to
the
arctic
ocean
in
the
veslemöy
in
the
existence
of
tidal
currents
in
the
open
ocean
was
proved
it
may
be
hoped
that
the
further
examination
of
the
fram
material
will
make
these
matters
clearer
but
however
this
may
be
it
is
interesting
to
establish
the
fact
that
in
so
great
and
deep
an
ocean
as
the
south
atlantic
very
considerable
variations
of
this
kind
may
occur
between
points
which
lie
near
together
and
in
the
same
current
as
we
have
already
mentioned
in
passing
the
observations
show
that
the
same
temperatures
and
salinities
as
are
found
at
the
surface
are
continued
downward
almost
unchanged
to
a
depth
of
between
and
metres
on
an
average
it
is
about
metres
this
is
a
typical
winter
condition
and
is
due
to
the
vertical
circulation
already
mentioned
which
is
caused
by
the
surface
water
being
cooled
in
winter
thus
becoming
heavier
than
the
water
below
so
that
it
must
sink
and
give
place
to
lighter
water
which
rises
in
this
way
the
upper
zones
of
water
become
mixed
and
acquire
almost
equal
temperatures
and
salinities
it
thus
appears
that
the
vertical
currents
reached
a
depth
of
about
metres
in
july
in
the
central
part
of
the
south
atlantic
this
cooling
of
the
water
is
a
gain
to
the
air
and
what
happens
is
that
not
only
the
surface
gives
off
warmth
to
the
air
but
also
the
waters
to
as
great
a
depth
as
is
reached
by
the
vertical
circulation
this
makes
it
a
question
of
enormous
values
this
state
of
things
is
clearly
apparent
in
the
sections
where
the
isotherms
and
isohalins
run
vertically
for
some
way
below
the
surface
it
is
also
clearly
seen
when
we
draw
the
curves
of
distribution
of
salinity
and
temperature
at
the
different
stations
as
we
have
done
in
the
two
diagrams
for
stations
and
fig
the
temperatures
had
fallen
several
degrees
at
the
surface
at
the
time
the
fram
investigations
were
made
and
if
we
are
to
judge
from
the
general
appearance
of
the
station
curves
and
from
the
form
they
usually
assume
in
summer
in
these
regions
we
shall
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
whole
volume
of
water
from
the
surface
down
to
a
depth
of
metres
must
be
cooled
on
an
average
about
as
already
pointed
out
a
simple
calculation
gives
the
following
if
a
cubic
metre
of
water
is
cooled
and
the
whole
quantity
of
warmth
thus
taken
from
the
water
is
given
to
the
air
it
will
be
sufficient
to
warm
more
than
cubic
metres
of
air
a
few
figures
will
give
an
impression
of
what
this
means
the
region
lying
between
lats
and
and
between
south
america
and
africa
roughly
speaking
the
region
investigated
by
the
fram
expedition
has
an
area
of
square
kilometres
we
may
now
assume
that
this
part
of
the
ocean
gave
off
so
much
warmth
to
the
air
that
a
zone
of
water
metres
in
depth
was
thereby
cooled
on
an
average
this
zone
of
water
weighs
about
trillion
kilogrammes
and
the
quantity
of
warmth
given
off
thus
corresponds
to
about
trillion
great
calories
it
has
been
calculated
that
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
earth
weighs
trillion
kilogrammes
and
it
will
require
something
over
trillion
great
calories
to
warm
the
whole
of
this
mass
of
air
from
this
it
follows
that
the
quantity
of
warmth
which
according
to
our
calculation
is
given
off
to
the
air
from
that
part
of
the
south
atlantic
lying
between
lats
and
will
be
sufficient
to
warm
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
earth
about
and
this
is
only
a
comparatively
small
part
of
the
ocean
these
figures
give
one
a
powerful
impression
of
the
important
part
played
by
the
sea
in
relation
to
the
air
the
sea
stores
up
warmth
when
it
absorbs
the
rays
of
the
sun
it
gives
off
warmth
again
when
the
cold
season
comes
we
may
compare
it
with
earthenware
stoves
which
continue
to
warm
our
rooms
long
after
the
fire
in
them
has
gone
out
in
a
similar
way
the
sea
keeps
the
earth
warm
long
after
summer
has
gone
and
the
sun
rays
have
lost
their
power
now
it
is
a
familiar
fact
that
the
average
temperature
of
the
air
for
the
whole
year
is
a
little
lower
than
that
of
the
sea
in
winter
it
is
as
a
rule
considerably
lower
the
sea
endeavours
to
raise
the
temperature
of
the
air
therefore
the
warmer
the
sea
is
the
higher
the
temperature
of
the
air
will
rise
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
after
several
years
investigations
in
the
norwegian
sea
we
have
found
that
the
winter
in
northern
europe
is
milder
than
usual
when
the
water
of
the
norwegian
sea
contains
more
than
the
average
amount
of
warmth
this
is
perfectly
natural
but
we
ought
now
to
be
able
to
go
a
step
farther
and
say
beforehand
whether
the
winter
air
will
be
warmer
or
colder
than
the
normal
after
determining
the
amount
of
warmth
in
the
sea
it
has
thus
been
shown
that
the
amount
of
warmth
in
that
part
of
the
ocean
which
we
call
the
norwegian
sea
varies
from
year
to
year
it
was
shown
by
the
atlantic
expedition
of
the
michael
sars
in
that
the
central
part
of
the
north
atlantic
was
considerably
colder
in
than
in
when
the
challenger
expedition
made
investigations
there
but
the
temperatures
in
fig
fig
temperatures
at
one
of
the
fram
and
one
of
the
challenger
stations
to
the
south
of
the
south
equatorial
current
were
about
the
same
as
those
of
when
the
challenger
was
on
her
way
back
to
england
we
can
now
make
similar
comparisons
as
regards
the
south
atlantic
in
the
challenger
took
a
number
of
stations
in
about
the
same
region
as
was
investigated
by
the
fram
the
challenger
station
at
the
end
of
march
lies
near
the
point
where
the
fram
station
was
taken
at
the
beginning
of
august
both
these
stations
lay
in
about
lat
approximately
between
africa
and
south
america
that
is
in
the
region
where
a
relatively
slack
current
runs
westward
to
the
south
of
the
south
equatorial
current
we
can
note
the
difference
in
fig
which
shows
the
distribution
of
temperature
at
the
two
stations
the
challenger
station
was
taken
during
the
autumn
and
the
fram
during
the
winter
it
was
therefore
over
warmer
at
the
surface
in
march
than
in
august
the
curve
for
the
challenger
station
shows
the
usual
distribution
of
temperature
immediately
below
the
surface
in
summer
the
temperature
falls
constantly
from
the
surface
downward
at
the
fram
station
we
see
the
typical
winter
conditions
we
there
find
the
same
temperature
from
the
surface
to
a
depth
of
metres
on
account
of
cooling
and
vertical
circulation
in
summer
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
temperature
curve
for
the
fram
station
would
have
taken
about
the
same
form
as
the
other
curve
but
it
would
have
shown
higher
temperatures
as
it
does
in
the
deeper
zones
from
metres
down
to
about
metres
for
we
see
that
in
these
zones
it
was
throughout
or
so
warmer
in
than
in
that
is
to
say
there
was
a
much
greater
store
of
warmth
in
this
part
of
the
ocean
in
than
in
may
not
the
result
of
this
have
been
that
the
air
in
this
region
and
also
in
the
east
of
south
america
and
the
west
of
africa
was
warmer
during
the
winter
of
than
during
that
of
we
have
not
sufficient
data
to
be
able
to
say
with
certainty
whether
this
difference
in
the
amount
of
warmth
in
the
two
years
applied
generally
to
the
whole
ocean
or
only
to
that
part
which
surrounds
the
position
of
the
station
but
if
it
was
general
we
ought
probably
to
be
able
to
find
a
corresponding
difference
in
the
climate
of
the
neighbouring
regions
between
and
metres
and
fathoms
the
temperatures
were
exactly
the
same
in
both
years
and
at
and
metres
and
fathoms
there
was
only
a
difference
of
two
or
three
tenths
of
a
degree
in
these
deeper
parts
of
the
ocean
the
conditions
are
probably
very
similar
we
have
there
no
variations
worth
mentioning
because
the
warming
of
the
surface
and
waters
by
the
sun
has
no
effect
there
unless
indeed
the
currents
at
these
depths
may
vary
so
fig
fig
temperatures
at
one
of
the
fram
and
one
of
the
valdivia
stations
in
the
benguela
current
much
that
there
may
be
a
warm
current
one
year
and
a
cold
one
another
year
but
this
is
improbable
out
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
african
coast
on
the
other
hand
it
looks
as
if
there
may
be
considerable
variations
even
in
the
deeper
zones
below
metres
fathoms
during
the
valdivia
expedition
in
a
station
no
was
taken
in
the
benguela
current
in
the
middle
of
october
not
far
from
the
point
at
which
the
fram
station
lay
the
temperature
curves
from
here
show
that
it
was
much
warmer
over
in
than
in
in
the
zones
between
and
metres
and
fathoms
probably
the
currents
may
vary
considerably
here
but
in
the
upper
waters
of
the
benguela
current
itself
from
the
surface
down
to
metres
it
was
considerably
warmer
in
than
in
this
difference
corresponds
to
that
which
we
found
in
the
previous
comparison
of
the
challenger
and
fram
stations
of
and
between
and
metres
and
fathoms
there
was
no
difference
between
and
nor
was
there
at
metres
fathoms
in
some
investigations
of
the
eastern
part
of
the
south
atlantic
were
conducted
by
the
planet
in
the
middle
of
march
a
station
was
taken
no
not
far
from
helena
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fram
station
at
the
end
of
july
here
also
we
find
great
variations
it
was
much
warmer
in
than
in
apart
from
the
winter
cooling
by
vertical
circulation
of
the
waters
at
a
depth
of
only
metres
fathoms
it
was
warmer
in
than
in
at
metres
fathoms
the
difference
was
over
and
even
at
metres
fathoms
it
was
about
warmer
in
than
in
at
metres
fathoms
the
difference
was
only
from
the
planet
station
we
also
have
problems
of
salinity
determined
by
modern
methods
it
appears
that
the
salinities
at
the
planet
station
in
any
case
to
a
depth
of
metres
were
lower
and
in
part
much
lower
than
those
of
the
fram
expedition
at
metres
the
difference
was
even
greater
than
per
mille
this
is
a
great
deal
in
the
same
region
of
open
sea
now
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
current
in
the
neighbourhood
of
helena
may
be
regarded
as
a
continuation
of
the
benguela
current
which
comes
from
the
south
and
has
relatively
low
salinities
it
looks
therefore
as
if
there
were
yearly
variations
of
salinity
in
these
fig
fig
temperatures
at
the
planet
station
and
the
fram
station
both
in
the
neighbourhood
of
helena
fig

salinities
at

station

and

regions
this
may
either
be
due
to
corresponding
variations
in
the
benguela
current
partly
because
the
relation
between
precipitation
and
evaporation
may
vary
in
different
years
and
partly
because
there
may
be
variations
in
the
acquisition
of
less
saline
water
from
the
antarctic
ocean
or
it
may
be
due
to
the
benguela
current
in
the
neighbourhood
of
helena
having
a
larger
admixture
of
the
warm
and
salt
water
to
the
west
of
it
in
one
year
than
in
another
in
either
case
we
may
expect
a
relatively
low
salinity
as
in
as
compared
with
to
be
accompanied
by
a
relatively
low
temperature
such
as
we
have
found
by
a
comparison
of
the
planet
observations
with
those
of
the
fram
we
require
a
larger
and
more
complete
material
for
comparison
but
even
that
which
is
here
referred
to
shows
that
there
may
be
considerable
yearly
variations
both
in
the
important
relatively
cold
benguela
current
and
in
the
currents
in
other
parts
of
the
south
atlantic
it
is
a
substantial
result
of
the
observations
made
on
the
fram
voyage
that
they
give
us
an
idea
of
great
annual
variations
in
so
important
a
region
as
the
south
atlantic
ocean
when
the
whole
material
has
been
further
examined
it
will
be
seen
whether
it
may
also
contribute
to
an
understanding
of
the
climatic
conditions
of
the
nearest
countries
where
there
is
a
large
population
and
where
in
consequence
a
more
accurate
knowledge
of
the
variations
of
climate
will
have
more
than
a
mere
scientific
interest

remark
that
besides

six
