a
biographical
sketch
adam
mickiewicz
the
last
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
an
important
period
for
russia
and
poland
not
only
politically
but
in
letters
and
art
it
marked
the
birth
of
statesmen
patriots
poets
and
writers
it
was
into
a
poland
of
great
names
and
greater
activities
that
adam
mickiewicz
was
born
in
as
son
of
an
impoverished
family
of
the
old
nobility
three
years
before
the
third
and
last
partition
of
his
native
land
had
taken
place
and
the
signed
documents
had
been
hastened
to
petersburg
to
make
more
triumphant
the
birthday
of
the
great
catherine
just
a
few
years
before
this
kosciusko
had
courageously
led
his
thousand
valiant
poles
in
their
brave
defiance
of
an
overwhelming
number
of
cossacks
and
russians
history
had
recorded
the
bloody
turkish
wars
the
pugatshev
rebellion
the
uprising
of
the
zaporogian
cossacks
and
the
polish
confederations
and
with
the
nineteenth
century
came
the
napoleonic
wars
with
the
dramatic
entry
of
napoleon
into
russia
and
a
new
and
different
mental
life
began
to
dawn
over
europe
mickiewicz
was
born
in
novogrodek
in
lithuania
this
was
the
birthplace
of
count
henry
rzewuski
who
wrote
the
delightful
memories
of
the
polish
eighteenth
century
under
the
title
of
the
memories
of
pan
severin
soplica
and
who
declared
he
considered
it
an
honor
to
be
born
a
schlazig
noble
of
lithuania
and
of
novogrodek
he
went
to
a
government
school
in
minsk
and
later
attended
the
university
of
vilna
which
city
in
his
day
was
a
place
of
jesuit
faith
gloomy
convents
and
echoing
bells
all
about
him
events
for
slav
lands
were
taking
place
it
was
a
resounding
inspired
age
for
his
race
and
he
grew
up
to
take
a
fitting
place
in
that
age
and
to
be
called
the
immortal
hero
of
polish
poetry
poland
just
then
was
the
not
only
for
the
armies
of
europe
but
for
the
diplomats
it
was
a
place
for
statesmen
to
win
their
spurs
if
accredited
to
petersburg
or
warsaw
and
successful
they
were
believed
to
be
equal
to
any
diplomatic
emergency
eloquence
inspiration
and
patriotic
fervor
must
have
cradled
his
childhood
footnote
the
full
title
of
the
book
is
memories
of
pan
severin
soplica
cupbearer
of
parnau
by
count
henry
rzewuski
at
the
time
of
the
birth
of
mickiewicz
russia
was
bringing
to
a
close
a
prodigious
period
of
development
in
almost
every
field
of
human
activity
it
was
really
the
of
a
nation
that
was
to
move
powerfully
and
to
dominate
partially
the
new
age
and
the
splendid
and
never
again
to
be
equalled
pageant
of
the
life
of
catherine
the
great
with
its
wild
dreams
of
world
dominance
and
of
the
glorious
revival
of
perished
greece
had
just
been
unrolled
for
the
amazement
of
europe
what
dramatic
and
enchanting
memories
the
names
of
her
followers
call
up
the
orlows
potemkin
panin
poniatowski
princess
daschkov
razumowski
in
france
too
the
same
preceding
period
had
been
brilliant
it
had
been
the
france
of
voltaire
the
encyclopedists
and
a
most
resplendent
and
luxurious
monarch
england
had
known
her
greatest
orators
and
prime
ministers
it
had
been
the
prussia
of
frederick
the
great
the
dresden
of
august
the
strong
the
austria
of
joseph
the
second
a
little
later
during
mickiewicz
own
youth
goethe
was
at
the
height
of
his
power
and
the
intellectual
dictator
of
europe
under
his
direction
and
encouragement
the
treasures
of
oriental
literature
were
being
translated
and
made
known
to
the
west
this
is
merely
a
hasty
glimpse
of
the
that
preceded
the
debut
in
life
of
the
most
renowned
of
polish
poets
the
old
traditions
of
absolute
and
monarchs
and
princely
times
were
coming
to
an
end
and
that
democratic
modern
world
where
everything
was
to
change
was
close
at
hand
just
over
the
crest
indeed
of
this
new
century
into
which
fate
was
ushering
him
he
was
to
see
the
last
of
blind
power
and
royal
prerogative
and
the
first
dawn
of
a
modern
spirit
which
in
time
would
sweep
away
forever
the
old
it
was
an
uncertain
difficult
transition
period
without
standards
and
without
measurements
as
we
take
a
fleeting
view
of
the
stirring
times
in
which
his
days
were
spent
his
travels
his
army
life
his
periods
of
professorship
we
can
not
help
but
wonder
at
the
amount
of
writing
mickiewicz
did
and
his
life
was
not
a
long
one
it
did
not
reach
to
sixty
years
but
during
the
working
years
allotted
him
before
a
mystical
melancholy
which
was
threatening
to
degenerate
into
madness
had
impaired
his
faculties
his
mind
was
unusually
brilliant
creative
and
marvelously
disciplined
it
obeyed
at
will
at
one
time
he
was
professor
of
latin
in
lausanne
at
another
time
he
held
the
chair
of
slavic
languages
in
paris
he
taught
polish
and
latin
in
kovno
he
traveled
extensively
in
italy
in
the
interest
of
the
polish
revolution
his
mind
was
and
capable
of
various
activities
he
devoted
considerable
time
to
advanced
mathematics
and
philosophy
he
made
scientific
investigations
in
vilna
under
lalewel
at
one
time
and
another
he
lived
in
various
large
cities
of
europe
in
germany
he
met
and
became
friendly
with
goethe
in
switzerland
he
met
krasinski
in
he
married
celina
szymanovska
her
mother
was
the
famous
slav
beauty
and
musician
who
had
so
delighted
goethe
in
her
youth
among
writers
of
russia
and
poland
whose
life
period
somewhat
coincided
with
that
of
mickiewicz
are
korzenowski
born
in
the
novelist
a
brother
of
adam
mickiewicz
was
with
korzenowski
at
charkov
danilewski
likewise
a
novelist
it
was
he
who
translated
the
crimean
sonnets
into
russian
malzweski
polish
patriot
and
poet
whose
maria
perhaps
the
most
popular
poetic
story
in
poland
appeared
at
almost
the
same
time
as
the
crimean
sonnets
zaleski
slowacki
krasinski
the
three
greatest
poets
of
poland
excepting
only
mickiewicz
himself
the
polish
critic
brodzinski
in
russia
the
golden
age
of
literature
almost
covered
the
same
period
as
mickiewicz
own
life
puschkin
lermontov
schukowski
gogol
to
mention
only
some
of
the
most
important
names
in
the
we
find
mickiewicz
in
paris
which
happened
to
be
filled
just
then
with
a
crowd
of
brilliant
slavic
exiles
here
he
became
the
friend
of
chopin
and
one
of
chopin
most
talented
pupils
a
young
polish
girl
made
the
first
translation
of
the
sonnets
into
french
it
was
a
wonderful
and
brilliant
paris
which
mickiewicz
entered
this
was
the
time
when
the
city
was
first
called
the
stepmother
of
genius
heine
was
here
in
exile
and
boerne
it
knew
the
personal
fascination
and
the
denunciative
writings
of
ferdinand
la
salle
it
was
the
day
too
of
eugene
sue
berlioz
george
sand
de
musset
dumas
gautier
the
goncourt
brothers
gavarni
sainte
beuve
liszt
felix
mendelssohn
ary
scheffer
delacroiz
horace
vernet
to
mention
only
a
few
great
names
at
random
julius
slowacki
count
krasinski
and
adam
mickiewicz
were
all
here
editing
their
poetry
in
the
midst
of
this
brilliant
life
in
the
inspiring
city
by
the
seine
this
period
in
paris
signs
perhaps
the
mark
of
the
creative
genius
of
mickiewicz
he
had
already
written
the
ballads
and
romances
the
third
part
of
dziady
pan
tadeuz
the
crimean
sequence
belongs
to
the
period
of
mickiewicz
youth
the
vilna
period
he
joined
a
society
at
this
time
which
was
looked
upon
with
disfavor
by
the
government
at
length
because
of
his
continued
participation
in
it
he
was
exiled
to
southern
russia
on
that
trip
while
he
was
going
toward
odessa
he
began
the
crimean
sonnets
their
success
was
quick
and
astonishing
they
were
translated
into
every
language
of
europe
although
the
form
is
the
traditional
and
classic
sonnet
form
he
makes
use
of
it
in
a
slightly
different
manner
not
altogether
as
an
exposition
of
the
sentiments
of
the
soul
and
the
convictions
and
emotions
of
the
mind
but
as
an
instrument
with
which
to
sketch
what
he
saw
upon
this
eventful
journey
he
used
the
sonnet
form
at
that
period
just
as
verhaeren
used
it
in
les
flamandes
to
show
us
flanders
and
as
albert
samain
in
le
chariot
to
picture
the
gardens
of
versailles
this
is
worthy
of
note
and
this
we
must
remember
was
before
in
the
poetical
works
of
mickiewicz
there
was
always
traceable
an
inclination
to
break
tradition
and
to
search
for
new
and
untried
possibilities
on
this
exile
in
russia
he
learned
to
know
puschkin
then
a
young
man
like
himself
puschkin
has
written
a
verse
letter
to
him
which
we
transcribe
in
free
prose
he
lived
among
us
for
a
while
a
people
strange
to
him
and
yet
his
mind
cherished
no
hatred
and
no
longing
for
revenge
generous
kind
of
heart
he
joined
our
evening
circles
and
we
loved
him
we
exchanged
our
dreams
our
plans
our
poems
god
gave
him
genius
and
inspiration
he
stood
always
on
the
heights
and
looked
down
on
life
we
talked
of
history
and
of
nations
he
declared
a
time
would
come
when
races
would
forget
all
evil
things
like
war
rebellion
and
dwell
together
peaceably
in
one
great
family
we
listened
to
him
eagerly
for
he
had
the
gift
of
speech
after
a
while
he
went
away
and
we
gave
our
blessing
to
him
then
we
learned
our
guest
spurred
on
by
his
revengeful
race
had
become
our
enemy
to
please
that
bitter
race
of
his
he
filled
his
songs
with
hatred
of
our
beloved
friend
there
came
to
us
only
revenge
and
angry
thoughts
god
grant
that
peace
may
come
again
to
his
embittered
heart
puschkin
himself
wrote
eloquently
of
these
same
crimean
scenes
that
mickiewicz
shows
us
he
too
was
inspired
by
the
old
capital
city
of
the
tartar
rulers
we
recall
his
fountain
of
baktschi
serai
and
he
too
brings
before
our
eyes
again
that
gigantic
mountain
world
of
southern
russia
in
the
prisoner
of
the
caucasus
the
fame
of
the
crimean
sonnets
was
so
great
that
mickiewicz
was
offered
a
government
position
which
attached
him
to
the
person
of
the
powerful
prince
galitzin
in
moscow
it
was
in
rome
and
singularly
enough
it
was
when
he
wrote
the
ode
to
youth
that
he
began
to
devote
himself
to
mystical
studies
which
had
such
an
injurious
effect
upon
his
mind
for
some
time
after
he
had
lost
his
fluent
power
as
a
poet
he
retained
his
conversational
gifts
which
were
remarkable
and
brought
him
almost
as
much
fame
as
his
poetry
his
life
ended
in
a
period
as
dramatic
as
that
in
which
it
began
he
entered
the
turkish
wars
in
and
died
in
stamboul
in
that
same
year
it
is
somewhat
peculiar
and
at
the
same
time
no
little
to
his
credit
that
he
should
have
chosen
the
sonnet
as
the
instrument
of
his
quick
sketching
of
crimea
on
the
trip
of
exile
because
the
sonnet
has
never
been
a
frequently
chosen
means
of
expression
of
the
slav
races
despite
the
numerous
sonnets
written
later
by
vrchlicky
preseren
and
others
the
sonnet
has
belonged
more
to
the
latin
races
and
to
the
english
race
the
crimean
sonnets
however
rank
among
the
famous
sequences

sings
my
polish
rose
the
graves
of
the
harem
they
sleep
well
here
whom
allah
loved
and
kept
and
treasured
in
his
vineyard
fair
and
fine
most
lustrous
of
the
orient
pearls
that
shine
which
youth
found
where
the
waves
of
passion
swept
here
where
in
peace
perpetual
they
have
slept
a
turban
beckons
where
the
roses
twine
a
banner
flutters
out
in
silken
line
and
sometimes
here
a
giaour
name
is
kept
oh
roses
of
this
paradise
of
old
the
eyes
that
loved
not
allah
saw
you
not
nor
arms
that
prayed
not
eastward
could
enfold
but
now
a
christian
treads
this
hallowed
spot
wise
allah
curse
not
him
who
bows
his
head
amid
the
marble
shrines
of
allah
dead
baydary
give
wings
unto
the
storm
and
spurs
to
steed
i
move
unchained
as
wind
across
the
world
sweep
onward
like
a
torrent
nor
sea
nor
height
nor
valley
pause
to
heed
the
twilight
spreads
a
dimness
our
speed
and
shows
the
from
hoofs
since
daylight
now
her
curtained
blue
has
juried
and
mystery
and
magic
shadows
breed
the
earth
sleeps
but
not
i
not
i
not
i
who
hasten
to
the
shore
where
waves
are
loud
and
toward
me
in
the
darkness
whitely
crowd
beneath
them
i
would
still
my
soul
deep
cry
like
ships
the
whirlpools
seize
to
drag
to
death
i
plunge
within
the
silence
sans
thought
breath
alushta
by
day
the
mighty
mountain
flings
its
down
with
little
flowers
the
gracious
fields
are
bright
and
from
the
forest
colors
flash
to
sight
like
gems
that
drop
from
off
a
calif
crown
upon
the
meadows
settles
shimmering
down
a
band
of
butterflies
in
rainbow
flight
cicadas
call
and
call
in
day
delight
and
bees
are
dreaming
in
a
blossom
crown
the
waves
beneath
the
cliff
are
now
upward
upward
in
their
rage
they
rise
and
tawny
are
their
crests
as
tigers
eyes
the
sun
is
focused
on
one
white
far
sail
and
on
blue
shining
deeps
as
smooth
as
glass
wherein
slim
cranes
are
shadowed
as
they
pass
alushta
by
night
the
drooping
weary
day
night
pushed
aside
on
tschatir
dagh
the
sullen
sun
and
low
paints
phantom
purple
upon
ancient
snow
while
forest
ways
within
the
wanderers
hide
night
veils
the
mountains
and
the
valleys
wide
the
thunderous
brooks
are
dulled
and
slow
beneath
the
blackness
fragrant
flowers
blow
and
rich
clothes
each
valley
side
almost
my
waking
eyes
are
too
with
gold
a
meteor
marks
the
sky
and
the
fiery
sparks
float
by
oh
beauty
of
the
eastern
night
you
woo
my
spirit
like
the
odalisque
who
held
men
captive
till
her
kiss
the
dream
dispelled
tschatir
dagh
mirza
the
reverent
mussulman
bends
low
to
greet
you
tschatir
dagh
crimea
ship
minaret
the
place
where
dip
down
stairs
from
golden
heaven
for
the
feet
you
guard
the
door
of
god
in
splendor
meet
like
gabriel
with
holy
sword
on
hip
in
bright
mist
mantled
from
the
toe
to
lip
tour
turban
set
with
alien
stars
and
sweet
if
winter
rule
the
world
or
summer
sun
if
giaour
rage
about
or
winds
are
wild
above
them
tschatir
dagh
you
changeless
one
are
like
to
allah
pure
and
undefiled
aloft
you
tower
from
out
the
lowly
sod
to
give
to
men
again
the
will
of
god
tschatir
dagh
the
pilgrim
below
me
half
a
world
i
see
outspread
above
blue
heaven
around
peaks
of
snow
and
yet
the
happy
pulse
of
life
is
slow
i
dream
of
distant
places
pleasures
dead
the
woods
of
lithuania
i
would
tread
where
birds
sing
songs
i
know
above
the
trembling
marshland
i
would
go
where
curlews
dip
and
call
head
a
tragic
lonely
terror
grips
my
heart
a
longing
for
some
peaceful
gentle
place
and
memories
of
youthful
love
i
trace
unto
my
childhood
home
i
long
to
start
and
yet
if
all
the
leaves
my
name
could
cry
she
would
not
pause
nor
heed
as
she
passed
by
the
pass
across
the
abyss
in
the
mirza
pray
pray
let
loose
the
bridle
look
not
down
the
humble
horse
alone
has
wisdom
here
he
knows
where
blackest
the
abysses
leer
and
where
the
path
in
safety
leads
us
down
pray
and
look
upward
to
the
mountain
crown
the
deep
below
is
endless
where
you
peer
stretch
not
the
hand
out
as
you
pass
for
fear
the
added
weight
of
that
might
plunge
you
down
and
check
your
thoughts
free
flight
too
while
you
go
let
all
of
fancy
fluttering
sails
be
furled
here
where
death
watches
the
riven
world
pilgrim
i
lived
to
cross
the
bridge
of
ancient
snow
but
what
i
saw
my
tongue
no
more
can
tell
the
angels
only
could
rehearse
that
well
mirza
behold
blue
heaven
in
that
deep
abyss
the
sea
is
that
behold
the
long
waves
shine
watch
how
they
rock
that
giant
bird
divine
whose
swinging
white
wings
wide
horizons
kiss
is
that
an
iceberg
in
the
blue
abyss
no
no
a
cloud
watch
how
is
veiling
fine
the
sea
the
land
every
line
to
drown
it
all
in
darkness
soon
i
wis
the
lightning
comes
now
frightful
is
its
sweep
but
softly
softly
watch
my
spur
my
whip
i
leap
across
unto
that
chasm
lip
what
still
and
chilling
sternness
great
cliffs
keep
down
there
light
calls
to
me
soon
there
i
be
uncanny
is
such
loneliness
to
me
the
ruins
of
balaclava
oh
thankless
crimean
land
in
ruin
laid
are
now
the
castles
that
were
once
your
pride
here
serpents
and
the
owls
from
daylight
hide
and
robbers
arm
them
for
the
nightly
raid
upon
the
lettered
marble
boasts
are
made
brave
words
on
battered
arms
in
gold
descried
and
broken
splendor
years
have
scattered
wide
beside
the
dead
who
made
them
are
arrayed
the
greek
set
shining
columned
marble
here
the
latin
put
the
mongol
horde
to
flight
and
mussulmans
prayed
eastward
morn
and
night
the
owl
and
vulture
of
dark
wing
and
drear
are
fluttering
like
black
banners
overhead
in
cities
where
the
pest
piles
high
the
dead
on
juda
cliff
on
juda
cliff
i
love
to
lean
and
look
on
waves
that
battling
beat
and
break
with
might
while
farther
seaward
in
a
bland
delight
i
see
them
shining
where
a
rainbow
shook
on
juda
cliff
i
love
to
lean
and
look
on
waves
that
like
swing
to
sight
to
send
upon
the
shore
their
billows
white
and
ebbing
to
leave
pearls
in
every
nook
thus
poet
in
your
youth
when
storms
are
wild
and
passions
break
upon
the
heart
and
brain
to
leave
their
ruin
there
shipwreck
and
waste
pick
up
your
lute
upon
it
undefiled
you
find
that
your
retain
the
crown
the
years
have
brought
you
white
and
chaste
here
then
end
the
crimean
sonnets
of
the
immortal
hero
of
polish
poetry
