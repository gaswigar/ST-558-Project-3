i
about
ten
miles
of
eastthorpe
lies
the
town
of
fenmarket
very
like
eastthorpe
generally
and
as
we
are
already
familiar
with
eastthorpe
a
particular
description
of
fenmarket
is
unnecessary
there
is
however
one
marked
difference
between
them
eastthorpe
it
will
be
remembered
is
on
the
border
between
the
low
uplands
and
the
fens
and
has
one
side
open
to
soft
swelling
hills
fenmarket
is
entirely
in
the
fens
and
all
the
roads
that
lead
out
of
it
are
alike
level
monotonous
straight
and
flanked
by
deep
and
stagnant
ditches
the
river
also
here
is
broader
and
slower
more
reluctant
than
it
is
even
at
eastthorpe
to
hasten
its
journey
to
the
inevitable
sea
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
the
visitor
to
fenmarket
would
perhaps
find
it
dull
and
depressing
and
at
times
under
a
grey
wintry
sky
almost
unendurable
but
nevertheless
for
days
and
weeks
it
has
a
charm
possessed
by
few
other
landscapes
in
england
provided
only
that
behind
the
eye
which
looks
there
is
something
to
which
a
landscape
of
that
peculiar
character
answers
there
is
for
example
the
wide
expanse
of
the
sky
there
is
the
distance
there
is
the
freedom
and
there
are
the
stars
on
a
clear
night
the
orderly
geometrical
march
of
the
constellations
from
the
extreme
eastern
horizon
across
the
meridian
and
down
to
the
west
has
a
solemn
majesty
which
is
only
partially
discernible
when
their
course
is
interrupted
by
broken
country
on
a
dark
afternoon
in
november
two
young
women
clara
and
madge
hopgood
were
playing
chess
in
the
back
parlour
of
their
mother
s
house
at
fenmarket
just
before
tea
clara
the
elder
was
about
fair
with
rather
light
hair
worn
flat
at
the
side
of
her
face
after
the
fashion
of
that
time
her
features
were
tolerably
regular
it
is
true
they
were
somewhat
marred
by
an
uneven
nasal
outline
but
this
was
redeemed
by
the
curved
lips
of
a
mouth
which
was
small
and
rather
compressed
and
by
a
definite
symmetrical
and
graceful
figure
her
eyes
were
grey
with
a
curious
peculiarity
in
them
ordinarily
they
were
steady
strong
eyes
excellent
and
renowned
optical
instruments
over
and
over
again
she
had
detected
along
the
stretch
of
the
eastthorpe
road
approaching
visitors
and
had
named
them
when
her
companions
could
see
nothing
but
specks
occasionally
however
these
steady
strong
grey
eyes
utterly
changed
they
were
the
same
eyes
the
same
colour
but
they
ceased
to
be
mere
optical
instruments
and
became
instruments
of
expression
transmissive
of
radiance
to
such
a
degree
that
the
light
which
was
reflected
from
them
seemed
insufficient
to
account
for
it
it
was
also
curious
that
this
change
though
it
must
have
been
accompanied
by
some
emotion
was
just
as
often
not
attended
by
any
other
sign
of
it
clara
was
in
fact
little
given
to
any
display
of
feeling
madge
four
years
younger
than
her
sister
was
of
a
different
type
altogether
and
one
more
easily
comprehended
she
had
very
heavy
dark
hair
and
she
had
blue
eyes
a
combination
which
fascinated
fenmarket
fenmarket
admired
madge
more
than
it
was
admired
by
her
in
return
and
she
kept
herself
very
much
to
herself
notwithstanding
what
it
considered
to
be
its
temptations
if
she
went
shopping
she
nearly
always
went
with
her
sister
she
stood
aloof
from
all
the
small
gaieties
of
the
town
walked
swiftly
through
its
streets
and
repelled
frigidly
and
decisively
all
offers
and
they
were
not
a
few
which
had
been
made
to
her
by
the
sons
of
the
fenmarket
tradesfolk
fenmarket
pronounced
her
and
having
thus
labelled
her
considered
it
had
exhausted
her
the
very
important
question
whether
there
was
anything
which
naturally
stuck
up
fenmarket
never
asked
it
was
a
great
relief
to
that
provincial
little
town
in
in
this
and
in
other
cases
to
find
a
word
which
released
it
from
further
mental
effort
and
put
out
of
sight
any
troublesome
straggling
indefinable
qualities
which
it
would
otherwise
have
been
forced
to
examine
and
name
madge
was
certainly
but
the
projection
above
those
around
her
was
not
artificial
both
she
and
her
sister
found
the
ways
of
fenmarket
were
not
to
their
taste
the
reason
lay
partly
in
their
nature
and
partly
in
their
history
mrs
hopgood
was
the
widow
of
the
late
manager
in
the
fenmarket
branch
of
the
bank
of
rumbold
martin
rumbold
and
when
her
husband
died
she
had
of
course
to
leave
the
bank
buildings
as
her
income
was
somewhat
straitened
she
was
obliged
to
take
a
small
house
and
she
was
now
living
next
door
to
the
crown
and
sceptre
the
principal
inn
in
the
town
there
was
then
no
fringe
of
villas
to
fenmarket
for
retired
quality
the
private
houses
and
shops
were
all
mixed
together
and
mrs
hopgood
s
cottage
was
squeezed
in
between
the
ironmonger
s
and
the
inn
it
was
very
much
lower
than
either
of
its
big
neighbours
but
it
had
a
brass
knocker
and
a
bell
and
distinctly
asserted
and
maintained
a
kind
of
aristocratic
superiority
mr
hopgood
was
not
a
fenmarket
man
he
came
straight
from
london
to
be
manager
he
was
in
the
bank
of
the
london
agents
of
rumbold
martin
rumbold
and
had
been
strongly
recommended
by
the
city
firm
as
just
the
person
to
take
charge
of
a
branch
which
needed
thorough
reorganisation
he
succeeded
and
nobody
in
fenmarket
was
more
respected
he
lived
however
a
life
apart
from
his
neighbours
excepting
so
far
as
business
was
concerned
he
went
to
church
once
on
sunday
because
the
bank
expected
him
to
go
but
only
once
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
its
dependent
institutions
he
was
a
great
botanist
very
fond
of
walking
and
in
the
evening
when
fenmarket
generally
gathered
itself
into
groups
for
gossip
either
in
the
street
or
in
back
parlours
or
in
the
crown
and
sceptre
mr
hopgood
tall
lean
and
stately
might
be
seen
wandering
along
the
solitary
roads
searching
for
flowers
which
in
that
part
of
the
world
were
rather
scarce
he
was
also
a
great
reader
of
the
best
books
english
german
and
french
and
held
high
doctrine
very
high
for
those
days
on
the
training
of
girls
maintaining
that
they
need
even
more
than
boys
exact
discipline
and
knowledge
boys
he
thought
find
health
in
an
occupation
but
an
uncultivated
unmarried
girl
dwells
with
her
own
untutored
thoughts
which
often
breed
disease
his
two
daughters
therefore
received
an
education
much
above
that
which
was
usual
amongst
people
in
their
position
and
each
of
unheard
of
wonder
in
spent
some
time
in
a
school
in
weimar
mr
hopgood
was
also
peculiar
in
his
way
of
dealing
with
his
children
he
talked
to
them
and
made
them
talk
to
him
and
whatever
they
read
was
translated
into
speech
thought
in
his
house
was
vocal
mrs
hopgood
too
had
been
the
intimate
friend
of
her
husband
and
was
the
intimate
friend
of
her
daughters
she
was
now
nearly
sixty
but
still
erect
and
graceful
and
everybody
could
see
that
the
picture
of
a
beautiful
girl
of
which
hung
opposite
the
fireplace
had
once
been
her
portrait
she
had
been
brought
up
as
thoroughly
as
a
woman
could
be
brought
up
in
those
days
to
be
a
governess
the
war
prevented
her
education
abroad
but
her
father
who
was
a
clergyman
not
too
rich
engaged
a
french
emigrant
lady
to
live
in
his
house
to
teach
her
french
and
other
accomplishments
she
consequently
spoke
french
perfectly
and
she
could
also
read
and
speak
spanish
fairly
well
for
the
french
lady
had
spent
some
years
in
spain
mr
hopgood
had
never
been
particularly
in
earnest
about
religion
but
his
wife
was
a
believer
neither
high
church
nor
low
church
but
inclined
towards
a
kind
of
quietism
not
uncommon
in
the
church
of
england
even
during
its
bad
time
a
reaction
against
the
formalism
which
generally
prevailed
when
she
married
mrs
hopgood
did
not
altogether
follow
her
husband
she
never
separated
herself
from
her
faith
and
never
would
have
confessed
that
she
had
separated
herself
from
her
church
but
although
she
knew
that
his
creed
externally
was
not
hers
her
own
was
not
sharply
cut
and
she
persuaded
herself
that
in
substance
his
and
her
belief
were
identical
as
she
grew
older
her
relationship
to
the
unseen
became
more
and
more
intimate
but
she
was
less
and
less
inclined
to
criticise
her
husband
s
freedom
or
to
impose
on
the
children
a
rule
which
they
would
certainly
have
observed
but
only
for
her
sake
every
now
and
then
she
felt
a
little
lonely
when
for
example
she
read
one
or
two
books
which
were
particularly
her
own
when
she
thought
of
her
dead
father
and
mother
and
when
she
prayed
her
solitary
prayer
mr
hopgood
took
great
pains
never
to
disturb
that
sacred
moment
indeed
he
never
for
an
instant
permitted
a
finger
to
be
laid
upon
what
she
considered
precious
he
loved
her
because
she
had
the
strength
to
be
what
she
was
when
he
first
knew
her
and
she
had
so
fascinated
him
he
would
have
been
disappointed
if
the
mistress
of
his
youth
had
become
some
other
person
although
the
change
in
a
sense
might
have
been
development
and
progress
he
did
really
love
her
piety
too
for
its
own
sake
it
mixed
something
with
her
behaviour
to
him
and
to
the
children
which
charmed
him
and
he
did
not
know
from
what
other
existing
source
anything
comparable
to
it
could
be
supplied
mrs
hopgood
seldom
went
to
church
the
church
to
be
sure
was
horribly
dead
but
she
did
not
give
that
as
a
reason
she
had
she
said
an
infirmity
a
strange
restlessness
which
prevented
her
from
sitting
still
for
an
hour
she
often
pleaded
this
excuse
and
her
husband
and
daughters
never
by
word
or
smile
gave
her
the
least
reason
to
suppose
that
they
did
not
believe
her
chapter
ii
both
clara
and
madge
went
first
to
an
english
and
clara
went
straight
from
this
school
to
germany
but
madge
s
course
was
a
little
different
she
was
not
very
well
and
it
was
decided
that
she
should
have
at
least
a
twelvemonth
in
a
at
brighton
before
going
abroad
it
had
been
very
highly
recommended
but
the
was
low
church
and
aggressive
mr
hopgood
far
away
from
the
high
and
low
church
controversy
came
to
the
conclusion
that
in
madge
s
case
the
theology
would
have
no
effect
on
her
it
was
quite
impossible
moreover
to
find
a
school
which
would
be
just
what
he
could
wish
it
to
be
madge
accordingly
was
sent
to
brighton
and
was
introduced
into
a
new
world
she
was
just
beginning
to
ask
herself
certain
things
were
right
and
other
things
were
wrong
and
the
brighton
answer
was
that
the
former
were
directed
by
revelation
and
the
latter
forbidden
and
that
the
body
was
an
affliction
to
the
soul
a
means
of
probation
our
principal
duty
being
to
war
against
it
madge
s
bedroom
companion
was
a
miss
selina
fish
daughter
of
barnabas
fish
esquire
of
clapham
and
merchant
of
the
city
of
london
miss
fish
was
not
traitorous
at
heart
but
when
she
found
out
that
madge
had
not
been
christened
she
was
so
overcome
that
she
was
obliged
to
tell
her
mother
miss
fish
was
really
unhappy
and
one
cold
night
when
madge
crept
into
her
neighbour
s
bed
contrary
to
law
but
in
accordance
with
custom
when
the
weather
was
very
bitter
poor
miss
fish
shrank
from
her
that
something
dreadful
might
happen
if
she
should
by
any
chance
touch
unbaptised
naked
flesh
mrs
fish
told
her
daughter
that
perhaps
miss
hopgood
might
be
a
dissenter
and
that
although
dissenters
were
to
be
pitied
and
even
to
be
condemned
many
of
them
were
undoubtedly
among
the
redeemed
as
for
example
that
man
of
god
dr
doddridge
whose
was
read
systematically
at
home
as
selina
knew
then
there
were
matthew
henry
whose
commentary
her
father
preferred
to
any
other
and
the
venerable
saint
the
reverend
william
jay
of
bath
whom
she
was
proud
to
call
her
friend
miss
fish
therefore
made
further
inquiries
gently
and
delicately
but
she
found
to
her
horror
that
madge
had
neither
been
sprinkled
nor
immersed
perhaps
she
was
a
jewess
or
a
heathen
this
was
a
happy
thought
for
then
she
might
be
converted
selina
knew
what
interest
her
mother
took
in
missions
to
heathens
and
jews
and
if
madge
by
the
humble
instrumentality
of
a
child
could
be
brought
to
the
foot
of
the
cross
what
would
her
mother
and
father
say
what
would
they
not
say
fancy
taking
madge
to
clapham
in
a
nice
white
should
be
white
thought
presenting
her
as
a
saved
lamb
the
very
next
night
she
began
i
suppose
your
father
is
a
foreigner
no
he
is
an
but
if
he
is
an
englishman
you
must
have
been
baptised
or
sprinkled
or
immersed
and
your
father
and
mother
must
belong
to
church
or
chapel
i
know
there
are
thousands
of
wicked
people
who
belong
to
neither
but
they
are
drunkards
and
liars
and
robbers
and
even
they
have
their
children
well
he
is
an
englishman
said
madge
smiling
perhaps
said
selina
timidly
he
may
may
mamma
and
papa
pray
for
the
jews
every
morning
they
are
not
like
other
no
he
is
certainly
not
a
what
is
he
then
he
is
my
papa
and
a
very
honest
good
oh
my
dear
madge
honesty
is
a
broken
reed
i
have
heard
mamma
say
that
she
is
more
hopeful
of
thieves
than
honest
people
who
think
they
are
saved
by
works
for
the
thief
who
was
crucified
went
to
heaven
and
if
he
had
been
only
an
honest
man
he
never
would
have
found
the
saviour
and
would
have
gone
to
hell
your
father
must
be
i
can
only
tell
you
again
that
he
is
honest
and
selina
was
confounded
she
had
heard
of
those
people
who
were
and
had
always
considered
them
as
so
dreadful
that
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
them
the
efforts
of
her
father
and
mother
did
not
extend
to
them
they
were
beyond
the
reach
of
the
vessels
of
wrath
if
madge
had
confessed
herself
roman
catholic
or
idolator
selina
knew
how
to
begin
she
would
have
pointed
out
to
the
catholic
how
unscriptural
it
was
to
suppose
that
anybody
could
forgive
sins
excepting
god
and
she
would
at
once
have
been
able
to
bring
the
idolator
to
his
knees
by
exposing
the
absurdity
of
worshipping
bits
of
wood
and
stone
but
with
a
person
who
was
nothing
she
could
not
tell
what
to
do
she
was
puzzled
to
understand
what
right
madge
had
to
her
name
who
had
any
authority
to
say
she
was
to
be
called
madge
hopgood
she
determined
at
last
to
pray
to
god
and
again
ask
her
mother
s
help
she
did
pray
earnestly
that
very
night
and
had
not
finished
until
long
after
madge
had
said
her
lord
s
prayer
this
was
always
said
night
and
morning
both
by
madge
and
clara
they
had
been
taught
it
by
their
mother
it
was
by
the
way
one
of
poor
selina
s
troubles
that
madge
said
nothing
but
the
lord
s
prayer
when
she
lay
down
and
when
she
rose
of
course
the
lord
s
prayer
was
the
could
it
be
otherwise
seeing
that
our
lord
used
it
those
who
supplemented
it
with
no
petitions
of
their
own
were
set
down
as
formalists
and
it
was
always
suspected
that
they
had
not
received
the
true
enlightenment
from
above
selina
cried
to
god
till
the
counterpane
was
wet
with
her
tears
but
it
was
the
answer
from
her
mother
which
came
first
telling
her
that
however
praiseworthy
her
intentions
might
be
argument
with
such
a
infidel
as
madge
would
be
most
perilous
and
she
was
to
desist
from
it
at
once
mrs
fish
had
by
that
post
written
to
miss
pratt
the
schoolmistress
and
selina
no
doubt
would
not
be
exposed
to
further
temptation
mrs
fish
s
letter
to
miss
pratt
was
very
strong
and
did
not
mince
matters
she
informed
miss
pratt
that
a
wolf
was
in
her
fold
and
that
if
the
creature
were
not
promptly
expelled
selina
must
be
removed
into
safety
miss
pratt
was
astonished
and
instantly
as
her
custom
was
sought
the
advice
of
her
sister
miss
hannah
pratt
who
had
charge
of
the
wardrobes
and
household
matters
generally
miss
hannah
pratt
was
never
in
the
best
of
tempers
and
just
now
was
a
little
worse
than
usual
it
was
one
of
the
rules
of
the
school
that
no
tradesmen
s
daughters
should
be
admitted
but
it
was
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line
and
when
drawn
the
misses
pratt
were
obliged
to
admit
it
was
rather
ridiculous
there
was
much
debate
over
an
application
by
an
auctioneer
he
was
clearly
not
a
tradesman
but
he
sold
chairs
tables
and
pigs
and
as
miss
hannah
said
used
vulgar
language
in
recommending
them
however
his
wife
had
money
they
lived
in
a
pleasant
house
in
lewes
and
the
line
went
outside
him
but
when
a
druggist
with
a
shop
in
bond
street
proposed
his
daughter
miss
hannah
took
a
firm
stand
what
is
the
use
of
a
principle
she
inquired
severely
if
we
do
not
adhere
to
it
on
the
other
hand
the
druggist
s
daughter
was
the
eldest
of
six
who
might
all
come
when
they
were
old
enough
to
leave
home
and
miss
pratt
thought
there
was
a
real
difference
between
a
druggist
and
say
a
bootmaker
bootmaker
said
miss
hannah
with
great
scorn
i
am
surprised
that
you
venture
to
hint
the
remotest
possibility
of
such
a
at
last
it
was
settled
that
the
line
should
also
be
drawn
outside
the
druggist
miss
hannah
however
had
her
revenge
a
tanner
in
bermondsey
with
a
house
in
bedford
square
had
sent
two
of
his
children
to
miss
pratt
s
seminary
their
mother
found
out
that
they
had
struck
up
a
friendship
with
a
young
person
whose
father
compounded
prescriptions
for
her
and
when
she
next
visited
brighton
she
called
on
miss
pratt
reminded
her
that
it
was
understood
that
her
pupils
would
all
be
taken
from
a
superior
class
in
society
and
gently
hinted
that
she
could
not
allow
bedford
square
to
be
contaminated
by
bond
street
miss
pratt
was
most
apologetic
enlarged
upon
the
druggist
s
respectability
and
more
particularly
upon
his
piety
and
upon
his
generous
contributions
to
the
cause
of
religion
this
indeed
was
what
decided
her
to
make
an
exception
in
his
favour
and
the
piety
also
of
his
daughter
was
most
however
the
tanner
s
lady
although
a
shining
light
in
the
church
herself
was
not
satisfied
that
a
retail
saint
could
produce
a
proper
companion
for
her
own
offspring
and
went
away
leaving
miss
pratt
very
uncomfortable
i
warned
you
said
miss
hannah
i
told
you
what
would
happen
and
as
to
mr
hopgood
i
suspected
him
from
the
first
besides
he
is
only
a
banker
s
well
what
is
to
be
done
put
your
foot
down
at
miss
hannah
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
put
down
with
emphasis
on
the
hearthrug
a
very
large
foot
cased
in
a
black
felt
shoe
but
i
can
not
dismiss
them
don
t
you
think
it
will
be
better
first
of
all
to
talk
to
miss
hopgood
perhaps
we
could
do
her
some
good
now
do
you
think
we
can
do
any
good
to
an
atheist
besides
we
have
to
consider
our
reputation
whatever
good
we
might
do
it
would
be
believed
that
the
infection
we
have
no
excuse
for
dismissing
the
excuse
none
is
needed
nor
would
any
be
justifiable
excuses
are
immoral
say
at
course
politely
and
with
the
school
is
established
on
a
certain
basis
it
will
be
an
advantage
to
us
if
it
is
known
why
these
girls
do
not
remain
i
will
dictate
the
letter
if
you
miss
hannah
pratt
had
not
received
the
education
which
had
been
given
to
her
younger
sister
and
therefore
was
nominally
subordinate
but
really
she
was
chief
she
considered
it
especially
her
duty
not
only
to
look
after
the
children
s
clothes
the
servants
and
the
accounts
but
to
maintain
everywhere
in
the
establishment
and
to
stiffen
her
sister
when
necessary
and
preserve
in
proper
sharpness
her
orthodoxy
both
in
theology
and
morals
accordingly
both
the
girls
left
and
both
knew
the
reason
for
leaving
the
druggist
s
faith
was
sorely
tried
if
miss
pratt
s
had
been
a
worldly
seminary
he
would
have
thought
nothing
of
such
behaviour
but
he
did
not
expect
it
from
one
of
the
faithful
the
next
sunday
morning
after
he
received
the
news
he
stayed
at
home
out
of
his
turn
to
make
up
any
medicines
which
might
be
urgently
required
and
sent
his
assistant
to
church
as
to
madge
she
enjoyed
her
expulsion
as
a
great
joke
and
her
brighton
experiences
were
the
cause
of
much
laughter
she
had
learned
a
good
deal
while
she
was
away
from
home
not
precisely
what
it
was
intended
she
should
learn
and
she
came
back
with
a
strong
insurgent
tendency
which
was
even
more
noticeable
when
she
returned
from
germany
neither
of
the
sisters
lived
at
the
school
in
weimar
but
at
the
house
of
a
lady
who
had
been
recommended
to
mrs
hopgood
and
by
this
lady
they
were
introduced
to
the
great
german
classics
she
herself
was
an
enthusiast
for
goethe
whom
she
well
remembered
in
his
old
age
and
clara
and
madge
each
of
them
in
turn
learned
to
know
the
poet
as
they
would
never
have
known
him
in
england
even
the
town
taught
them
much
about
him
for
in
many
ways
it
was
expressive
of
him
and
seemed
as
if
it
had
shaped
itself
for
him
it
was
a
delightful
time
for
them
they
enjoyed
the
society
and
constant
mental
stimulus
they
loved
the
beautiful
park
not
a
separate
enclosure
walled
round
like
an
english
park
but
suffering
the
streets
to
end
in
it
and
in
summer
time
there
were
excursions
into
the
thüringer
wald
generally
to
some
point
memorable
in
history
or
for
some
literary
association
the
drawback
was
the
contrast
when
they
went
home
with
fenmarket
with
its
dulness
and
its
complete
isolation
from
the
intellectual
world
at
weimar
in
the
evening
they
could
see
egmont
or
hear
fidelio
or
talk
with
friends
about
the
last
utterance
upon
the
leben
jesu
but
the
fenmarket
egmont
was
a
travelling
show
its
fidelio
psalm
tunes
or
at
best
some
of
bishop
s
glees
performed
by
a
few
of
the
tradesfolk
who
had
never
had
an
hour
s
instruction
in
music
and
for
theological
criticism
there
were
the
parish
church
and
ram
lane
chapel
they
did
their
best
they
read
their
old
favourites
and
subscribed
for
a
german
as
well
as
an
english
literary
weekly
newspaper
but
at
times
they
were
almost
beaten
madge
more
than
clara
was
liable
to
depression
no
fenmarket
maiden
other
than
the
hopgoods
was
supposed
to
have
any
connection
whatever
or
to
have
any
capacity
for
any
connection
with
anything
outside
the
world
in
which
young
ladies
dwelt
and
if
a
fenmarket
girl
read
a
book
a
rare
occurrence
for
there
were
no
circulating
libraries
there
in
those
days
she
never
permitted
herself
to
say
anything
more
than
that
it
was
nice
or
it
was
not
nice
or
she
liked
it
or
did
not
like
it
and
if
she
had
ventured
to
say
more
fenmarket
would
have
thought
her
odd
not
to
say
a
little
improper
the
hopgood
young
women
were
almost
entirely
isolated
for
the
tradesfolk
felt
themselves
uncomfortable
and
inferior
in
every
way
in
their
presence
and
they
were
ineligible
for
rectory
and
brewery
society
not
only
because
their
father
was
merely
a
manager
but
because
of
their
strange
ways
mrs
tubbs
the
brewer
s
wife
thought
they
were
due
to
germany
from
what
she
knew
of
germany
she
considered
it
most
injudicious
and
even
morally
wrong
to
send
girls
there
she
once
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
german
lady
at
an
hotel
at
tunbridge
wells
and
was
quite
shocked
she
could
see
quite
plainly
that
the
standard
of
female
delicacy
must
be
much
lower
in
that
country
than
in
england
mr
tubbs
was
sure
mrs
hopgood
must
have
been
french
and
said
to
his
daughters
mysteriously
you
never
can
tell
who
frenchwomen
but
papa
said
miss
tubbs
you
know
mrs
hopgood
s
maiden
name
we
found
that
out
it
was
of
course
my
dear
of
course
but
if
she
was
a
frenchwoman
resident
in
england
she
would
prefer
to
assume
an
english
name
that
is
to
say
if
she
wished
to
be
occasionally
the
miss
hopgoods
were
encountered
and
they
confounded
fenmarket
sorely
on
one
memorable
occasion
there
was
a
party
at
the
rectory
it
was
the
annual
party
into
which
were
swept
all
the
unclassifiable
which
could
not
be
put
into
the
two
gatherings
which
included
the
aristocracy
and
the
democracy
of
the
place
miss
clara
hopgood
amazed
everybody
by
beginning
talk
by
asking
mrs
greatorex
her
hostess
who
had
been
far
away
to
sidmouth
for
a
holiday
whether
she
had
been
to
the
place
where
coleridge
was
born
and
when
the
parson
s
wife
said
she
had
not
and
that
she
could
not
be
expected
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
the
birthplace
of
an
infidel
miss
hopgood
expressed
her
surprise
and
declared
she
would
walk
twenty
miles
any
day
to
see
ottery
st
mary
still
worse
when
somebody
observed
that
an
lecturer
was
coming
to
fenmarket
and
the
parson
s
daughter
cried
how
horrid
miss
hopgood
talked
again
and
actually
told
the
parson
that
so
far
as
she
had
read
upon
the
her
reading
about
the
argument
was
all
one
way
and
that
after
colonel
thompson
nothing
new
could
really
be
urged
what
is
she
was
about
to
say
objectionable
but
she
recollected
her
official
position
and
that
she
was
bound
to
be
so
odd
and
unusual
observed
mrs
greatorex
to
mrs
tubbs
afterwards
is
not
that
miss
hopgood
should
have
radical
views
mrs
barker
i
know
is
a
radical
like
her
husband
but
then
she
never
puts
herself
forward
nor
makes
speeches
i
never
saw
anything
quite
like
it
except
once
in
london
at
a
lady
montgomery
then
went
on
in
much
the
same
way
but
she
was
a
baronet
s
wife
the
baronet
was
in
parliament
she
received
a
good
deal
and
was
obliged
to
entertain
her
poor
clara
she
was
really
very
unobtrusive
and
very
modest
but
there
had
been
constant
sympathy
between
her
and
her
father
not
the
dumb
sympathy
as
between
man
and
dog
but
that
which
can
manifest
itself
in
human
fashion
chapter
iii
clara
and
her
father
were
both
and
at
the
time
at
which
our
history
begins
clara
had
been
teaching
madge
the
game
for
about
six
months
check
said
clara
check
after
about
a
dozen
moves
it
is
of
no
use
to
go
on
you
always
beat
me
i
should
not
mind
that
if
i
were
any
better
now
than
when
i
started
it
is
not
in
the
reason
is
that
you
do
not
look
two
moves
ahead
you
never
say
to
yourself
suppose
i
move
there
what
is
she
likely
to
do
and
what
can
i
do
afterwards
that
is
just
what
is
impossible
to
me
i
can
not
hold
myself
down
the
moment
i
go
beyond
the
next
move
my
thoughts
fly
away
and
i
am
in
a
muddle
and
my
head
turns
round
i
was
not
born
for
it
i
can
do
what
is
under
my
nose
well
enough
but
nothing
the
planning
and
the
forecasting
are
the
soul
of
the
game
i
should
like
to
be
a
general
and
play
against
armies
and
calculate
the
consequences
of
it
would
kill
me
i
should
prefer
the
fighting
besides
calculation
is
useless
for
when
i
think
that
you
will
be
sure
to
move
such
and
such
a
piece
you
generally
do
then
what
makes
the
difference
between
the
good
and
the
bad
player
it
is
a
gift
an
instinct
i
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
give
it
up
you
are
very
fond
of
that
word
instinct
i
wish
you
would
not
use
i
have
heard
you
use
it
and
say
you
instinctively
like
this
person
or
certainly
i
do
not
deny
that
sometimes
i
am
drawn
to
a
person
or
repelled
from
him
before
i
can
say
why
but
i
always
force
myself
to
discover
afterwards
the
cause
of
my
attraction
or
repulsion
and
i
believe
it
is
a
duty
to
do
so
if
we
neglect
it
we
are
little
better
than
the
brutes
and
may
grossly
deceive
at
this
moment
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
and
madge
jumped
up
nearly
the
board
and
rushed
into
the
front
room
it
was
the
coach
from
london
which
once
a
day
passed
through
fenmarket
on
its
road
to
lincoln
it
was
not
the
direct
route
from
london
to
lincoln
but
the
went
this
way
to
accommodate
fenmarket
and
other
small
towns
it
slackened
speed
in
order
to
change
horses
at
the
crown
and
sceptre
and
as
madge
stood
at
the
window
a
gentleman
on
the
looked
at
her
intently
as
he
passed
in
another
minute
he
had
descended
and
was
welcomed
by
the
landlord
who
stood
on
the
pavement
clara
meanwhile
had
taken
up
a
book
but
before
she
had
read
a
page
her
sister
skipped
into
the
parlour
again
humming
a
tune
let
me
you
said
but
it
is
not
she
put
her
elbows
on
the
table
rested
her
head
between
her
hands
and
appeared
to
contemplate
the
game
profoundly
now
then
what
do
you
say
to
that
it
was
really
a
very
lucky
move
and
clara
whose
thoughts
perhaps
were
elsewhere
was
presently
most
unaccountably
defeated
madge
was
triumphant
where
are
all
your
schemes
baffled
by
a
poor
creature
who
can
hardly
put
two
and
two
perhaps
your
schemes
were
better
than
you
know
they
were
not
i
saw
the
queen
ought
to
take
that
bishop
and
never
bothered
myself
as
to
what
would
follow
have
you
not
lost
your
faith
in
schemes
you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
suppose
that
because
of
one
failure
or
of
twenty
failures
i
would
give
up
a
clara
you
are
a
strange
creature
don
t
let
us
talk
any
more
about
madge
swept
all
the
pieces
with
her
hand
into
the
box
shut
it
closed
the
board
and
put
her
feet
on
the
fender
you
never
believe
in
impulses
or
in
doing
a
thing
just
because
here
and
now
it
appears
to
be
the
proper
thing
to
do
suppose
anybody
were
to
make
love
to
how
i
wish
somebody
would
you
dear
girl
for
nobody
deserves
it
madge
put
her
head
caressingly
on
clara
s
shoulder
and
then
raised
it
again
suppose
i
say
anybody
were
to
make
love
to
you
would
you
hold
off
for
six
months
and
consider
and
consider
and
ask
yourself
whether
he
had
such
and
such
virtues
and
whether
he
could
make
you
happy
would
not
that
stifle
love
altogether
would
you
not
rather
obey
your
first
impression
and
if
you
felt
you
loved
him
would
you
not
say
yes
time
is
not
everything
a
man
who
is
prompt
and
is
therefore
thought
to
be
hasty
by
sluggish
creatures
who
are
never
half
awake
may
in
five
minutes
spend
more
time
in
consideration
than
his
critics
will
spend
in
as
many
weeks
i
have
never
had
the
chance
and
am
not
likely
to
have
it
i
can
only
say
that
if
it
were
to
come
to
me
i
should
try
to
use
the
whole
strength
of
my
soul
precisely
because
the
question
would
be
so
important
would
it
be
necessary
to
employ
every
faculty
i
have
in
order
to
decide
it
i
do
not
believe
in
oracles
which
are
supposed
to
prove
their
divinity
by
giving
no
reasons
for
their
ah
well
believe
in
shakespeare
his
lovers
fall
in
love
at
first
no
doubt
they
do
but
to
justify
yourself
you
have
to
suppose
that
you
are
a
juliet
and
your
friend
a
romeo
they
may
for
aught
i
know
be
examples
in
my
favour
however
i
have
to
lay
down
a
rule
for
my
own
poor
limited
self
and
to
speak
the
truth
i
am
afraid
that
great
men
often
do
harm
by
imposing
on
us
that
which
is
serviceable
to
themselves
only
or
to
put
it
perhaps
more
correctly
we
mistake
the
real
nature
of
their
processes
just
as
a
person
who
is
unskilled
in
arithmetic
would
mistake
the
processes
of
anybody
who
is
very
quick
at
it
and
would
be
led
away
by
them
shakespeare
is
much
to
me
but
the
more
he
is
to
me
the
more
careful
i
ought
to
be
to
discover
what
is
the
true
law
of
my
own
nature
more
important
to
me
after
all
than
shakespeare
exactly
i
know
what
the
law
of
mine
is
if
a
man
were
to
present
himself
to
me
i
should
rely
on
that
instinct
you
so
much
despise
and
i
am
certain
that
the
balancing
method
would
be
fatal
it
would
disclose
a
host
of
reasons
against
any
conclusion
and
i
should
never
come
to
clara
smiled
although
this
impetuosity
was
foreign
to
her
she
loved
it
for
the
good
which
accompanied
it
you
do
not
mean
to
say
you
would
accept
or
reject
him
at
once
no
certainly
not
what
i
mean
is
that
in
a
few
days
perhaps
in
a
shorter
time
something
within
me
would
tell
me
whether
we
were
suited
to
one
another
although
we
might
not
have
talked
upon
i
think
the
risk
but
there
is
just
as
much
risk
the
other
way
you
would
examine
your
friend
catalogue
him
sum
up
his
beliefs
note
his
behaviour
under
various
experimental
trials
and
miserably
fail
after
all
your
scientific
investigation
to
ascertain
just
the
one
important
point
whether
you
loved
him
and
could
live
with
him
your
reason
was
not
meant
for
that
kind
of
work
if
a
woman
trusts
in
such
matters
to
the
faculty
by
which
when
she
wishes
to
settle
whether
she
is
to
take
this
house
or
that
she
puts
the
advantages
of
the
larger
back
kitchen
on
one
side
and
the
bigger
front
kitchen
on
the
other
i
pity
mrs
hopgood
at
this
moment
came
downstairs
and
asked
when
in
the
name
of
fortune
they
meant
to
have
the
tea
ready
chapter
iv
frank
palmer
the
gentleman
whom
we
saw
descend
from
the
coach
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
wholesale
and
manufacturing
chemist
in
london
he
was
now
about
and
having
just
been
admitted
as
a
partner
he
had
begun
as
the
custom
was
in
those
days
to
travel
for
his
firm
the
elder
mr
palmer
was
a
man
of
refinement
something
more
than
a
whig
in
politics
and
an
enthusiastic
member
of
the
broad
church
party
which
was
then
becoming
a
power
in
the
country
he
was
living
in
a
fine
old
house
at
stoke
newington
with
acres
of
ground
round
it
and
if
frank
had
been
born
thirty
years
later
he
would
probably
have
gone
to
cambridge
or
oxford
in
those
days
however
it
was
not
the
custom
to
send
boys
to
the
universities
unless
they
were
intended
for
the
law
divinity
or
idleness
and
frank
s
training
which
was
begun
at
st
paul
s
school
was
completed
there
he
lived
at
home
going
to
school
in
the
morning
and
returning
in
the
evening
he
was
surrounded
by
every
influence
which
was
pure
and
noble
mr
maurice
and
mr
sterling
were
his
father
s
guests
and
hence
it
may
be
inferred
that
there
was
an
altar
in
the
house
and
that
the
sacred
flame
burnt
thereon
mr
palmer
almost
worshipped
mr
maurice
and
his
admiration
was
not
blind
for
maurice
connected
the
bible
with
what
was
rational
in
his
friend
what
still
believable
no
need
then
to
pitch
it
overboard
here
after
all
is
the
eternal
word
it
can
be
imagined
how
those
who
dared
not
close
their
eyes
to
the
light
and
yet
clung
to
that
book
which
had
been
so
much
to
their
forefathers
and
themselves
rejoiced
when
they
were
able
to
declare
that
it
belonged
to
them
more
than
to
those
who
misjudged
them
and
could
deny
that
they
were
heretics
the
boy
s
education
was
entirely
classical
and
athletic
and
as
he
was
quick
at
learning
and
loved
his
games
he
took
a
high
position
amongst
his
he
was
not
particularly
reflective
but
he
was
generous
and
courageous
perfectly
straightforward
a
fair
specimen
of
thousands
of
english
boys
as
he
grew
up
he
somewhat
disappointed
his
father
by
a
lack
of
any
real
interest
in
the
subjects
in
which
his
father
was
interested
he
accepted
willingly
and
even
enthusiastically
the
household
conclusions
on
religion
and
politics
but
they
were
not
properly
his
for
he
accepted
them
merely
as
conclusions
and
without
the
premisses
and
it
was
often
even
a
little
annoying
to
hear
him
express
some
free
opinion
on
religious
questions
in
a
way
which
showed
that
it
was
not
a
growth
but
something
picked
up
mr
palmer
senior
sometimes
recoiled
into
intolerance
and
orthodoxy
and
bewildered
his
son
who
to
use
one
of
his
own
phrases
hardly
knew
where
his
father
partly
the
reaction
was
due
to
the
oscillation
which
accompanies
serious
and
independent
thought
but
mainly
it
was
caused
by
mr
palmer
s
discontent
with
frank
s
appropriation
of
a
sentiment
or
doctrine
of
which
he
was
not
the
lawful
owner
frank
however
was
so
hearty
so
affectionate
and
so
cheerful
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
love
him
dearly
in
his
visits
to
fenmarket
frank
had
often
noticed
madge
for
the
crown
and
sceptre
was
his
headquarters
and
madge
was
well
enough
aware
that
she
had
been
noticed
he
had
inquired
casually
who
it
was
who
lived
next
door
and
when
the
waiter
told
him
the
name
and
that
mr
hopgood
was
formerly
the
bank
manager
frank
remembered
that
he
had
often
heard
his
father
speak
of
a
mr
hopgood
a
clerk
in
a
bank
in
london
as
one
of
his
best
friends
he
did
not
fail
to
ask
his
father
about
this
friend
and
to
obtain
an
introduction
to
the
widow
he
had
now
brought
it
to
fenmarket
and
within
half
an
hour
after
he
had
alighted
he
had
presented
it
mrs
hopgood
of
course
recollected
mr
palmer
perfectly
and
the
welcome
to
frank
was
naturally
very
warm
it
was
delightful
to
connect
earlier
and
happier
days
with
the
present
and
she
was
proud
in
the
possession
of
a
relationship
which
had
lasted
so
long
clara
and
madge
too
were
both
excited
and
pleased
to
say
nothing
of
frank
s
appearance
of
his
unsnobbish
deferential
behaviour
which
showed
that
he
understood
who
they
were
and
that
the
little
house
made
no
difference
to
him
the
girls
and
the
mother
could
not
resist
a
side
glance
at
fenmarket
and
the
indulgence
of
a
secret
satisfaction
that
it
would
soon
hear
that
the
son
of
mr
palmer
so
well
known
in
every
town
round
about
was
on
intimate
terms
with
them
madge
was
particularly
gay
that
evening
the
presence
of
sympathetic
people
was
always
a
powerful
stimulus
to
her
and
she
was
often
astonished
at
the
witty
things
and
even
the
wise
things
she
said
in
such
company
although
when
she
was
alone
so
few
things
wise
or
witty
occurred
to
her
like
all
persons
who
in
conversation
do
not
so
much
express
the
results
of
previous
conviction
obtained
in
silence
as
the
inspiration
of
the
moment
madge
dazzled
everybody
by
a
brilliancy
which
would
have
been
impossible
if
she
had
communicated
that
which
had
been
slowly
acquired
but
what
she
left
with
those
who
listened
to
her
did
not
always
seem
on
reflection
to
be
so
much
as
it
appeared
to
be
while
she
was
talking
still
she
was
very
charming
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
sometimes
her
spontaneity
was
truer
than
the
limitations
of
speech
more
carefully
weighed
what
makes
you
stay
in
fenmarket
mrs
hopgood
how
i
wish
you
would
come
to
london
i
do
not
wish
to
leave
it
now
i
have
become
attached
to
it
i
have
very
few
friends
in
london
and
lastly
perhaps
the
most
convincing
reason
i
could
not
afford
it
rent
and
living
are
cheaper
here
than
in
would
you
not
like
to
live
in
london
miss
hopgood
clara
hesitated
for
a
few
seconds
i
am
not
not
by
myself
i
was
in
london
once
for
six
months
as
a
governess
in
a
very
pleasant
family
where
i
saw
much
society
but
i
was
glad
to
return
to
to
the
scenery
round
fenmarket
interrupted
madge
it
is
so
romantic
so
mountainous
so
interesting
in
every
i
was
thinking
of
people
strange
as
it
may
appear
in
london
nobody
really
cares
for
anybody
at
least
not
in
the
sense
in
which
i
should
use
the
words
men
and
women
in
london
stand
for
certain
talents
and
are
valued
often
very
highly
for
them
but
they
are
valued
merely
as
representing
these
talents
now
if
i
had
a
talent
i
should
not
be
satisfied
with
admiration
or
respect
because
of
it
no
matter
what
admiration
or
respect
or
even
enthusiasm
i
might
evoke
even
if
i
were
told
that
my
services
had
been
immense
and
that
life
had
been
changed
through
my
instrumentality
i
should
feel
the
lack
of
quiet
personal
affection
and
that
i
believe
is
not
common
in
london
if
i
were
famous
i
would
sacrifice
all
the
adoration
of
the
world
for
the
love
of
a
i
had
a
sister
who
perhaps
had
never
heard
what
it
was
which
had
made
me
certainly
said
madge
laughing
for
the
love
of
a
sister
but
mr
palmer
i
like
london
i
like
the
people
just
the
people
although
i
do
not
know
a
soul
and
not
a
soul
cares
a
brass
farthing
about
me
i
am
not
half
so
stupid
in
london
as
in
the
country
i
never
have
a
thought
of
my
own
down
here
how
should
i
but
in
london
there
is
plenty
of
talk
about
all
kinds
of
things
and
i
find
i
too
have
something
in
me
it
is
true
as
clara
says
that
nobody
is
anything
particular
to
anybody
but
that
to
me
is
rather
pleasant
i
do
not
want
too
much
of
profound
and
eternal
attachments
they
are
rather
a
burden
they
involve
profound
and
eternal
attachment
on
my
part
and
i
have
always
to
be
at
my
best
such
watchfulness
and
such
jealousy
i
prefer
a
and
slippers
and
bonds
which
are
not
so
madge
madge
i
wish
you
would
sometimes
save
me
the
trouble
of
laboriously
striving
to
discover
what
you
really
mrs
hopgood
bethought
herself
that
her
daughters
were
talking
too
much
to
one
another
as
they
often
did
even
when
guests
were
present
and
she
therefore
interrupted
them
mr
palmer
you
see
both
town
and
do
you
prefer
oh
i
hardly
know
the
country
in
perhaps
and
town
in
the
this
was
a
safe
answer
and
one
which
was
not
very
original
that
is
to
say
it
expressed
no
very
distinct
belief
but
there
was
one
valid
reason
why
he
liked
being
in
london
in
the
winter
your
father
i
remember
loves
music
i
suppose
you
inherit
his
taste
and
it
is
impossible
to
hear
good
music
in
the
i
am
very
fond
of
music
have
you
heard
st
paul
i
was
at
birmingham
when
it
was
first
performed
in
this
country
oh
it
lovely
and
he
began
humming
thou
faithful
unto
frank
did
really
care
for
music
he
went
wherever
good
music
was
to
be
had
he
belonged
to
a
choral
society
and
was
in
great
request
amongst
his
father
s
friends
at
evening
entertainments
he
could
also
play
the
piano
so
far
as
to
be
able
to
accompany
himself
thereon
he
sang
to
himself
when
he
was
travelling
and
often
murmured
favourite
airs
when
people
around
him
were
talking
he
had
lessons
from
an
old
italian
a
little
withered
shabby
creature
who
was
not
very
proud
of
his
pupil
he
is
a
talent
said
the
signor
and
he
will
amuse
himself
good
for
a
ballad
at
a
party
but
a
musician
no
and
like
all
mere
talents
frank
failed
in
his
songs
to
give
them
just
what
is
of
most
that
which
separates
an
artistic
performance
from
the
vast
region
of
respectable
but
uninteresting
commonplace
there
was
a
curious
lack
in
him
also
of
correspondence
between
his
music
and
the
rest
of
himself
as
music
is
expression
it
might
be
supposed
that
something
which
it
serves
to
express
would
always
lie
behind
it
but
this
was
not
the
case
with
him
although
he
was
so
attractive
and
delightful
in
many
ways
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
his
love
for
beethoven
was
genuine
but
that
which
was
in
frank
palmer
was
not
that
of
which
the
sonatas
and
symphonies
of
the
master
are
the
voice
he
went
into
raptures
over
the
slow
movement
in
the
symphony
but
no
slow
movement
was
discernible
in
his
character
what
on
earth
can
be
found
in
st
paul
which
can
be
put
to
music
said
madge
fancy
a
chapter
in
the
epistle
to
the
romans
turned
into
a
duet
madge
madge
i
am
ashamed
of
you
said
her
mother
well
mother
said
clara
i
am
sure
that
some
of
the
settings
by
your
divinity
handel
are
absurd
as
in
adam
all
may
be
true
enough
and
the
harmonies
are
magnificent
but
i
am
always
tempted
to
laugh
when
i
hear
frank
hummed
the
familiar
apostrophe
not
is
that
a
bit
of
st
paul
said
mrs
hopgood
yes
it
goes
like
this
and
frank
went
up
to
the
little
piano
and
sang
the
song
through
there
is
no
fault
to
be
found
with
that
said
madge
so
far
as
the
coincidence
of
sense
and
melody
is
concerned
but
i
do
not
care
much
for
oratorios
better
subjects
can
be
obtained
outside
the
bible
and
the
main
reason
for
selecting
the
bible
is
that
what
is
called
religious
music
may
be
provided
for
good
people
an
oratorio
to
me
is
never
quite
natural
jewish
history
is
not
a
musical
subject
and
besides
you
can
not
have
proper
love
songs
in
an
oratorio
and
in
them
music
is
at
its
mrs
hopgood
was
accustomed
to
her
daughter
s
extravagance
but
she
was
nevertheless
a
little
uncomfortable
ah
said
frank
who
had
not
moved
from
the
piano
and
he
struck
the
first
two
bars
of
oh
please
said
madge
go
on
go
on
but
frank
could
not
quite
finish
it
she
was
sitting
on
the
little
sofa
and
she
put
her
feet
up
lay
and
listened
with
her
eyes
shut
there
was
a
vibration
in
mr
palmer
s
voice
not
perceptible
during
his
vision
of
the
crown
of
life
and
of
fidelity
to
death
are
you
going
to
stay
over
sunday
inquired
mrs
hopgood
i
am
not
quite
sure
i
ought
to
be
back
on
sunday
evening
my
father
likes
me
to
be
at
home
on
that
is
there
not
a
mr
maurice
who
is
a
friend
of
your
father
oh
yes
a
great
he
is
not
high
church
nor
low
church
no
not
what
is
he
then
what
does
he
believe
well
i
can
hardly
say
he
does
not
believe
that
anybody
will
be
burnt
in
a
brimstone
lake
for
that
is
what
he
does
not
believe
interposed
clara
he
believes
that
socrates
and
the
great
greeks
and
romans
who
acted
up
to
the
light
that
was
within
them
were
not
sent
to
hell
i
think
that
is
glorious
don
t
you
yes
but
that
also
is
something
he
does
not
believe
what
is
there
in
him
which
is
positive
what
has
he
distinctly
won
from
the
unknown
ah
miss
hopgood
you
ought
to
hear
him
yourself
he
is
wonderful
i
do
admire
him
so
much
i
am
sure
you
would
like
if
you
do
not
go
home
on
saturday
said
mrs
hopgood
we
shall
be
pleased
if
you
will
have
dinner
with
us
on
sunday
we
generally
go
for
a
walk
in
the
frank
hesitated
but
at
that
moment
madge
rose
from
the
sofa
her
hair
was
disarranged
and
she
pushed
its
thick
folds
backward
it
grew
rather
low
down
on
her
forehead
and
stood
up
a
little
on
her
temples
a
mystery
of
shadow
and
dark
recess
if
it
had
been
electrical
with
the
force
of
a
strong
battery
and
had
touched
him
he
could
not
have
been
more
completely
paralysed
and
his
resolution
to
go
back
on
saturday
was
instantly
laid
flat
thank
you
mrs
hopgood
looking
at
madge
and
meeting
her
eyes
i
think
it
very
likely
i
shall
stay
and
if
i
do
i
will
most
certainly
accept
your
kind
chapter
v
sunday
morning
came
and
frank
being
in
the
country
considered
himself
absolved
from
the
duty
of
going
to
church
and
went
for
a
long
stroll
at
one
he
presented
himself
at
mrs
hopgood
s
house
i
have
had
a
letter
from
london
said
clara
to
frank
telling
me
a
most
extraordinary
story
and
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
it
a
man
who
was
left
a
widower
had
an
only
child
a
lovely
daughter
of
about
fourteen
years
old
in
whose
existence
his
own
was
completely
wrapped
up
she
was
subject
at
times
to
curious
fits
of
or
absence
of
mind
and
while
she
was
under
their
influence
she
resembled
a
somnambulist
rather
than
a
sane
human
being
awake
her
father
would
not
take
her
to
a
physician
for
he
dreaded
lest
he
should
be
advised
to
send
her
away
from
home
and
he
also
feared
the
effect
which
any
recognition
of
her
disorder
might
have
upon
her
he
believed
that
in
obscure
and
diseases
like
hers
it
was
prudent
to
suppress
all
notice
of
them
and
that
if
he
behaved
to
her
as
if
she
were
perfectly
well
she
would
stand
a
chance
of
recovery
moreover
the
child
was
visibly
improving
and
it
was
probable
that
the
disturbance
in
her
health
would
be
speedily
outgrown
one
hot
day
he
went
out
shopping
with
her
and
he
observed
that
she
was
tired
and
strange
in
her
manner
although
she
was
not
ill
or
at
least
not
so
ill
as
he
had
often
before
seen
her
the
few
purchases
they
had
to
make
at
the
draper
s
were
completed
and
they
went
out
into
the
street
he
took
her
and
in
doing
so
it
opened
and
he
saw
to
his
horror
a
white
silk
crumpled
up
in
it
which
he
instantly
recognised
as
one
which
had
been
shown
him
five
minutes
before
but
he
had
not
bought
the
next
moment
a
hand
was
on
his
shoulder
it
was
that
of
an
assistant
who
requested
that
they
would
both
return
for
a
few
minutes
as
they
walked
the
half
dozen
steps
back
the
father
s
resolution
was
taken
i
am
sixty
he
thought
to
himself
and
she
is
they
went
into
the
and
he
confessed
that
he
had
taken
the
handkerchief
but
that
it
was
taken
by
mistake
and
that
he
was
about
to
restore
it
when
he
was
arrested
the
poor
girl
was
now
herself
again
but
her
mind
was
an
entire
blank
as
to
what
she
had
done
and
she
could
not
doubt
her
father
s
statement
for
it
was
a
man
s
handkerchief
and
the
bag
was
in
his
hands
the
draper
was
inexorable
and
as
he
had
suffered
much
from
petty
thefts
of
late
had
determined
to
make
an
example
of
the
first
offender
whom
he
could
catch
the
father
was
accordingly
prosecuted
convicted
and
sentenced
to
imprisonment
when
his
term
had
expired
his
daughter
who
i
am
glad
to
say
never
for
an
instant
lost
her
faith
in
him
went
away
with
him
to
a
distant
part
of
the
country
where
they
lived
under
an
assumed
name
about
ten
years
afterwards
he
died
and
kept
his
secret
to
the
last
but
he
had
seen
the
complete
recovery
and
happy
marriage
of
his
child
it
was
remarkable
that
it
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
have
been
guilty
but
her
father
s
confession
as
already
stated
was
apparently
so
sincere
that
she
could
do
nothing
but
believe
him
you
will
wonder
how
the
facts
were
discovered
after
his
death
a
sealed
paper
disclosing
them
was
found
with
the
inscription
to
be
opened
during
my
daughter
s
if
she
should
have
children
or
a
husband
who
may
survive
is
to
be
she
had
no
children
and
when
she
died
as
an
old
woman
her
husband
also
being
dead
the
seal
was
probably
said
madge
nobody
except
his
daughter
believed
he
was
not
a
thief
for
her
sake
he
endured
the
imputation
of
common
larceny
and
was
content
to
leave
the
world
with
only
a
remote
chance
that
he
would
ever
be
i
wonder
said
frank
that
he
did
not
admit
that
it
was
his
daughter
who
had
taken
the
handkerchief
and
excuse
her
on
the
ground
of
her
he
could
not
do
that
replied
madge
the
object
of
his
life
was
to
make
as
little
of
the
ailment
as
possible
what
would
have
been
the
effect
on
her
if
she
had
been
made
aware
of
its
fearful
consequences
furthermore
would
he
have
been
believed
and
thought
the
child
might
have
suspected
him
of
attempting
to
shield
himself
at
her
expense
do
you
think
you
could
be
capable
of
such
sacrifice
mr
palmer
frank
hesitated
it
the
question
is
not
fair
madge
said
mrs
hopgood
interrupting
him
you
are
asking
for
a
decision
when
all
the
materials
to
make
up
a
decision
are
not
present
it
is
wrong
to
question
ourselves
in
cold
blood
as
to
what
we
should
do
in
a
great
strait
for
the
emergency
brings
the
insight
and
the
power
necessary
to
deal
with
it
i
often
fear
lest
if
a
trial
were
to
befall
me
i
should
miserably
fail
so
i
should
furnished
as
i
now
am
but
not
as
i
should
be
under
stress
of
the
what
is
the
use
said
clara
of
speculating
whether
we
can
or
can
not
do
this
or
that
it
now
an
interesting
subject
for
discussion
whether
the
lie
was
a
no
said
madge
a
thousand
times
brief
and
decisive
well
mr
palmer
what
do
you
say
that
is
rather
an
awkward
question
a
lie
is
a
but
not
broke
in
madge
vehemently
to
save
anybody
whom
you
love
is
a
contemptible
little
to
be
applied
to
such
an
action
as
that
the
consequences
of
such
a
philosophy
though
my
dear
said
mrs
hopgood
are
rather
serious
the
moment
you
dispense
with
a
fixed
standard
you
can
not
refuse
permission
to
other
people
to
dispense
with
it
ah
yes
i
know
all
about
that
but
i
am
not
going
to
give
up
my
instinct
for
the
sake
of
a
rule
do
what
you
feel
to
be
right
and
let
the
rule
go
hang
somebody
cleverer
in
logic
than
we
are
will
come
along
afterwards
and
find
a
higher
rule
which
we
have
obeyed
and
will
formulate
it
as
for
my
poor
self
said
clara
i
do
not
profess
to
know
without
the
rule
what
is
right
and
what
is
not
we
are
always
trying
to
transcend
the
rule
by
some
special
pleading
and
often
in
virtue
of
some
fancied
superiority
generally
speaking
the
attempt
is
madge
said
mrs
hopgood
your
dogmatic
decision
may
have
been
interesting
but
it
prevented
the
expression
of
mr
palmer
s
madge
bent
forward
and
politely
inclined
her
head
to
the
embarrassed
frank
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
i
have
never
thought
much
about
such
matters
is
not
what
they
call
casuistry
a
science
among
roman
catholics
if
i
were
in
a
difficulty
and
could
not
tell
right
from
wrong
i
should
turn
catholic
and
come
to
you
as
my
priest
mrs
then
you
would
do
not
what
you
thought
right
yourself
but
what
i
thought
right
the
worth
of
the
right
to
you
is
that
it
is
your
right
and
that
you
arrive
at
it
in
your
own
way
besides
you
might
not
have
time
to
consult
anybody
were
you
never
compelled
to
settle
promptly
a
case
of
this
kind
i
remember
once
at
school
when
the
mathematical
master
was
out
of
the
a
boy
named
carpenter
ran
up
to
the
blackboard
and
wrote
carrots
on
it
that
was
the
master
s
nickname
for
he
was
scarcely
was
the
word
finished
when
carpenter
heard
him
coming
along
the
passage
there
was
just
time
partially
to
rub
out
some
of
the
big
letters
but
car
remained
and
carpenter
was
standing
at
the
board
when
carrots
came
in
he
was
an
excitable
man
and
he
knew
very
well
what
the
boys
called
him
what
have
you
been
writing
on
the
board
sir
carpenter
the
master
examined
the
board
the
upper
half
of
the
second
r
was
plainly
perceptible
but
it
might
possibly
have
been
a
he
turned
round
looked
steadily
at
carpenter
for
a
moment
and
then
looked
at
us
carpenter
was
no
favourite
but
not
a
soul
spoke
go
to
your
place
carpenter
went
to
his
place
the
letters
were
erased
and
the
lesson
was
resumed
i
was
greatly
perplexed
i
had
acquiesced
in
a
cowardly
falsehood
carrots
was
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
i
could
not
bear
to
feel
that
he
was
humbugged
so
when
we
were
outside
i
went
up
to
carpenter
and
told
him
he
was
an
infernal
sneak
and
we
had
a
desperate
fight
and
i
licked
him
and
blacked
both
his
eyes
i
did
not
know
what
else
to
the
company
laughed
we
can
not
said
madge
all
of
us
come
to
terms
after
this
fashion
with
our
consciences
but
we
have
had
enough
of
these
discussions
on
morality
let
us
go
they
went
out
and
as
some
relief
from
the
straight
road
they
turned
into
a
field
as
they
came
home
and
walked
along
a
footpath
which
crossed
the
broad
deep
ditches
by
planks
they
were
within
about
fifty
yards
of
the
last
and
broadest
ditch
more
a
dyke
than
a
ditch
when
frank
turning
round
saw
an
ox
which
they
had
not
noticed
galloping
after
them
go
on
go
on
he
cried
make
for
the
he
discerned
in
an
instant
that
unless
the
course
of
the
animal
could
be
checked
it
would
overtake
them
before
the
bridge
could
be
reached
the
women
fled
but
frank
remained
he
was
in
the
habit
of
carrying
a
heavy
the
end
of
which
he
had
hollowed
out
in
his
schooldays
and
had
filled
up
with
lead
just
as
the
ox
came
upon
him
it
laid
its
head
to
the
ground
and
frank
springing
aside
dealt
it
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
forehead
with
his
knobbed
weapon
the
creature
was
dazed
it
stopped
and
staggered
and
in
another
instant
frank
was
across
the
bridge
in
safety
there
was
a
little
hysterical
sobbing
but
it
was
soon
over
oh
mr
palmer
said
mrs
hopgood
what
presence
of
mind
and
what
courage
we
should
have
been
killed
without
the
feat
is
not
original
mrs
hopgood
i
saw
it
done
by
a
tough
little
farmer
last
summer
on
a
bull
that
was
really
mad
there
was
no
ditch
for
him
though
poor
fellow
and
he
had
to
jump
a
you
did
not
find
it
difficult
said
madge
to
settle
your
problem
when
it
came
to
you
in
the
shape
of
a
wild
because
there
was
nothing
to
settle
said
frank
laughing
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
so
you
believed
or
rather
so
you
saw
said
clara
i
should
have
seen
things
at
is
to
say
and
i
said
madge
should
have
settled
it
the
wrong
way
i
am
sure
i
should
even
if
i
had
been
a
man
i
should
have
frank
stayed
to
tea
and
the
evening
was
musical
he
left
about
ten
but
just
as
the
door
had
shut
he
remembered
he
had
forgotten
his
stick
he
gave
a
gentle
rap
and
madge
appeared
she
gave
him
his
stick
again
thanks
for
my
frank
cursed
himself
that
he
could
not
find
the
proper
word
he
knew
there
was
something
which
might
be
said
and
ought
to
be
said
but
he
could
not
say
it
madge
held
out
her
hand
to
him
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
and
then
astonished
at
his
boldness
he
instantly
retreated
he
went
to
the
crown
and
sceptre
and
was
soon
in
bed
but
not
to
sleep
strange
that
the
moment
we
lie
down
in
the
dark
images
which
were
half
obscured
should
become
so
intensely
luminous
madge
hovered
before
frank
with
almost
tangible
distinctness
and
he
felt
his
fingers
moving
in
her
heavy
voluptuous
tresses
her
picture
at
last
became
almost
painful
to
him
and
shamed
him
so
that
he
turned
over
from
side
to
side
to
avoid
it
he
had
never
been
thrown
into
the
society
of
women
of
his
own
age
for
he
had
no
sister
and
a
fire
was
kindled
within
him
which
burnt
with
a
heat
all
the
greater
because
his
life
had
been
so
pure
at
last
he
fell
asleep
and
did
not
wake
till
late
in
the
morning
he
had
just
time
to
eat
his
breakfast
pay
one
more
business
visit
in
the
town
and
catch
the
coach
due
at
eleven
o
clock
from
lincoln
to
london
as
the
horses
were
being
changed
he
walked
as
near
as
he
dared
venture
to
the
windows
of
the
cottage
next
door
but
he
could
see
nobody
when
the
coach
however
began
to
move
he
turned
round
and
looked
behind
him
and
a
hand
was
waved
to
him
he
took
off
his
hat
and
in
five
minutes
he
was
clear
of
the
town
it
was
in
sight
a
long
way
but
when
at
last
it
disappeared
a
cloud
of
wretchedness
swept
over
him
as
the
vapour
sweeps
up
from
the
sea
what
was
she
doing
talking
to
other
people
existing
for
others
laughing
with
others
there
were
miles
between
himself
and
fenmarket
life
what
was
life
a
few
moments
of
living
and
long
dreary
gaps
between
all
this
however
is
a
vain
attempt
to
delineate
what
was
shapeless
it
was
an
intolerable
unvanquishable
oppression
this
was
love
this
was
the
blessing
which
the
god
with
the
ruddy
wings
had
bestowed
on
him
it
was
a
relief
to
him
when
the
coach
rattled
through
islington
and
in
a
few
minutes
had
landed
him
at
the
chapter
vi
there
was
to
be
a
grand
entertainment
in
the
assembly
room
of
the
crown
and
sceptre
in
aid
of
the
county
hospital
mrs
martin
widow
of
one
of
the
late
partners
in
the
bank
lived
in
a
large
house
near
fenmarket
and
still
had
an
interest
in
the
business
she
was
distinctly
above
anybody
who
lived
in
the
town
and
she
knew
how
to
show
her
superiority
by
venturing
sometimes
to
do
what
her
urban
neighbours
could
not
possibly
do
she
had
been
known
to
carry
through
the
street
a
quart
bottle
of
horse
physic
although
it
was
wrapped
up
in
nothing
but
brown
paper
on
her
way
she
met
the
brewer
s
wife
who
was
more
aggrieved
than
she
was
when
mrs
martin
s
carriage
swept
past
her
in
the
dusty
narrow
lane
which
led
to
the
hall
mrs
martin
could
also
afford
to
recognise
in
a
measure
the
claims
of
education
and
talent
a
gentleman
came
from
london
to
lecture
in
the
town
and
showed
astonished
fenmarket
an
orrery
and
a
magic
lantern
with
dissolving
views
of
the
holy
land
the
exhibition
had
been
provided
in
order
to
extinguish
a
debt
incurred
in
repairing
the
church
but
the
rector
s
wife
and
the
brewer
s
wife
after
consultation
decided
that
they
must
leave
the
lecturer
to
return
to
his
inn
mrs
martin
however
invited
him
to
supper
of
course
she
knew
mr
hopgood
well
and
knew
that
he
was
no
ordinary
man
she
knew
also
something
of
mrs
hopgood
and
the
daughters
and
that
they
were
no
ordinary
women
she
had
been
heard
to
say
that
they
were
ladies
and
that
mr
hopgood
was
a
gentleman
and
she
kept
up
a
distant
kind
of
intimacy
with
them
always
nodded
to
them
whenever
she
met
them
and
every
now
and
then
sent
them
grapes
and
flowers
she
had
observed
once
or
twice
to
mrs
tubbs
that
mr
hopgood
was
a
remarkable
person
who
was
quite
scientific
and
therefore
did
not
associate
with
the
rest
of
the
fenmarket
folk
and
mrs
tubbs
was
much
annoyed
particularly
by
a
slight
emphasis
which
she
thought
she
detected
in
the
therefore
for
mr
tubbs
had
told
her
that
one
of
the
smaller
london
brewers
who
had
only
about
fifty
had
refused
to
meet
at
dinner
a
learned
french
chemist
who
had
written
books
mrs
martin
could
not
make
friends
with
the
hopgoods
nor
enter
the
cottage
it
would
have
been
a
transgression
of
that
infinitely
fine
and
tortuous
line
whose
inexplicable
convolutions
mark
off
what
is
forbidden
to
a
society
lady
clearly
however
the
hopgoods
could
be
requested
to
at
the
crown
and
sceptre
in
fact
it
would
be
impolitic
not
to
put
some
of
the
townsfolk
on
the
list
of
patrons
so
it
came
about
that
mrs
hopgood
was
included
and
that
she
was
made
responsible
for
the
provision
of
one
song
and
one
recitation
for
the
song
it
was
settled
that
frank
palmer
should
be
asked
as
he
would
be
in
fenmarket
usually
he
came
but
once
every
half
year
but
he
had
not
been
able
so
he
said
to
finish
all
his
work
the
last
time
the
recitation
madge
undertook
the
evening
arrived
the
room
was
crowded
and
a
dozen
private
carriages
stood
in
the
crown
and
sceptre
courtyard
frank
called
for
the
hopgoods
mrs
hopgood
and
clara
sat
with
presentation
tickets
in
the
second
row
amongst
the
fashionable
folk
frank
and
madge
were
upon
the
platform
frank
was
loudly
applauded
in
mio
but
the
loudest
applause
of
the
evening
was
reserved
for
madge
who
declaimed
byron
s
of
with
much
energy
she
certainly
looked
very
charming
in
her
red
gown
harmonising
with
her
black
hair
the
men
in
the
audience
were
vociferous
for
something
more
and
would
not
be
contented
until
she
again
came
forward
the
truth
is
that
the
wily
young
woman
had
prepared
herself
beforehand
for
possibilities
but
she
artfully
concealed
her
preparation
looking
on
the
ground
and
hesitating
she
suddenly
raised
her
head
as
if
she
had
just
remembered
something
and
then
repeated
sir
henry
wotton
s
she
was
again
greeted
with
cheers
subdued
so
as
to
be
in
accordance
with
the
character
of
the
poem
but
none
the
less
sincere
and
in
the
midst
of
them
she
gracefully
bowed
and
retired
mrs
martin
complimented
her
warmly
at
the
end
of
the
performance
and
inwardly
debated
whether
madge
could
be
asked
to
enliven
one
of
the
parties
at
the
hall
and
how
it
could
at
the
same
time
be
made
clear
to
the
guests
that
she
and
her
mother
who
must
come
with
her
were
not
even
acquaintances
properly
so
called
but
were
patronised
as
persons
of
merit
living
in
the
town
which
the
hall
protected
mrs
martin
was
obliged
to
be
very
careful
she
certainly
was
on
the
list
at
the
lord
lieutenant
s
but
she
was
in
the
outer
ring
and
she
was
not
asked
to
those
small
and
select
little
dinners
which
were
given
to
sir
egerton
the
dean
of
peterborough
lord
francis
and
his
brother
the
county
member
she
decided
however
that
she
could
make
perfectly
plain
the
conditions
upon
which
the
hopgoods
would
be
present
and
the
next
day
she
sent
madge
a
little
note
asking
her
if
she
would
assist
in
some
festivities
at
the
hall
in
about
two
months
time
which
were
to
be
given
in
celebration
of
the
birthday
of
mrs
martin
s
third
son
the
scene
from
the
where
ferdinand
and
miranda
are
discovered
playing
chess
was
suggested
and
it
was
proposed
that
madge
should
be
miranda
and
mr
palmer
ferdinand
mrs
martin
concluded
with
a
hope
that
mrs
hopgood
and
her
eldest
daughter
would
witness
the
frank
joyously
consented
for
amateur
theatricals
had
always
attracted
him
and
in
a
few
short
weeks
he
was
again
at
fenmarket
he
was
obliged
to
be
there
for
three
or
four
days
before
the
entertainment
in
order
to
attend
the
rehearsals
which
mrs
martin
had
put
under
the
control
of
a
professional
gentleman
from
london
and
madge
and
he
were
consequently
compelled
to
make
frequent
journeys
to
the
hall
at
last
the
eventful
night
arrived
and
a
carriage
was
hired
next
door
to
take
the
party
they
drove
up
to
the
grand
entrance
and
were
met
by
a
footman
who
directed
madge
and
frank
to
their
and
escorted
mrs
hopgood
and
clara
to
their
places
in
the
theatre
they
had
gone
early
in
order
to
accommodate
frank
and
madge
and
they
found
themselves
alone
they
were
surprised
that
there
was
nobody
to
welcome
them
and
a
little
more
surprised
when
they
found
that
the
places
allotted
to
them
were
rather
in
the
rear
presently
two
or
three
fiddlers
were
seen
who
began
to
tune
their
instruments
then
some
fenmarket
folk
and
some
of
the
tenants
on
the
estate
made
their
appearance
and
took
seats
on
either
side
of
mrs
hopgood
and
clara
quite
at
the
back
were
the
servants
at
five
minutes
to
eight
the
band
struck
up
the
overture
to
and
in
the
midst
of
it
in
sailed
mrs
martin
and
a
score
or
two
of
people
male
and
female
the
curtain
ascended
and
prospero
s
cell
was
seen
alonso
and
his
companions
were
properly
grouped
and
prospero
began
behold
sir
king
the
wronged
duke
of
milan
the
audience
applauded
him
vigorously
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
his
speech
but
there
was
an
instantaneous
cry
of
hush
when
prospero
disclosed
the
lovers
it
was
really
very
pretty
miranda
wore
a
loose
simple
white
robe
and
her
wonderful
hair
was
partly
twisted
into
a
knot
and
partly
strayed
down
to
her
waist
the
dialogue
between
the
two
was
spoken
with
much
dramatic
feeling
and
when
ferdinand
came
to
the
sir
she
is
mortal
but
by
immortal
providence
she
s
mine
old
boston
a
worthy
and
wealthy
farmer
who
sat
next
to
mrs
hopgood
cried
out
hear
hear
but
was
instantly
suppressed
he
put
his
head
down
behind
the
people
in
front
of
him
rubbed
his
knees
grinned
and
then
turned
to
mrs
hopgood
whom
he
knew
and
whispered
with
his
hand
to
his
mouth
and
a
precious
lucky
chap
he
mrs
hopgood
watched
intently
and
when
gonzalo
invoked
the
gods
to
drop
a
blessed
crown
on
the
couple
and
the
applause
was
renewed
and
boston
again
cried
hear
hear
without
fear
of
check
she
did
not
applaud
for
something
told
her
that
behind
this
stage
show
a
drama
was
being
played
of
far
more
serious
importance
the
curtain
fell
but
there
were
loud
calls
for
the
performers
it
rose
and
they
presented
themselves
alonso
still
holding
the
hands
of
the
happy
pair
the
cheering
now
was
vociferous
more
particularly
when
a
wreath
was
flung
at
the
feet
of
the
young
princess
and
ferdinand
stooping
placed
it
on
her
head
again
the
curtain
fell
the
band
struck
up
some
dance
music
and
the
audience
were
treated
to
something
light
and
roared
with
laughter
at
a
pretty
chambermaid
at
an
inn
who
captivated
and
bamboozled
a
young
booby
who
was
staying
there
pitched
him
overboard
wondered
what
he
meant
sang
an
audacious
song
recounting
her
many
exploits
and
finished
with
a
the
performers
and
their
friends
were
invited
to
a
sumptuous
supper
and
the
fenmarket
folk
were
not
at
home
until
two
in
the
morning
on
their
way
back
clara
broke
out
against
the
juxtaposition
of
shakespeare
and
such
vulgarity
much
better
she
said
to
have
left
the
shakespeare
out
altogether
the
lesson
of
the
sequence
is
that
each
is
good
in
its
way
a
perfectly
hateful
doctrine
to
me
frank
and
madge
were
however
in
the
best
of
humours
especially
frank
who
had
taken
a
glass
of
wine
beyond
his
customary
very
temperate
allowance
but
miss
hopgood
mrs
martin
had
to
suit
all
tastes
we
must
not
be
too
severe
upon
there
was
something
in
this
remark
most
irritating
to
clara
the
word
tastes
for
example
as
if
the
difference
between
miranda
and
the
chambermaid
were
a
matter
of
she
was
annoyed
too
with
frank
s
easy
cheery
tones
for
she
felt
deeply
what
she
said
and
his
mitigation
and
smiling
latitudinarianism
were
more
exasperating
than
direct
opposition
i
am
sure
continued
frank
that
if
we
were
to
take
the
votes
of
the
audience
miranda
would
be
the
queen
of
the
evening
and
he
put
the
crown
which
he
had
brought
away
with
him
on
her
head
again
clara
was
silent
in
a
few
moments
they
were
at
the
door
of
their
house
it
had
begun
to
rain
and
madge
stepping
out
of
the
carriage
in
a
hurry
threw
a
shawl
over
her
head
forgetting
the
wreath
it
fell
into
the
gutter
and
was
splashed
with
mud
frank
picked
it
up
wiped
it
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
took
it
into
the
parlour
and
laid
it
on
a
chair
chapter
vii
the
next
morning
it
still
rained
a
cold
rain
from
the
a
very
disagreeable
type
of
weather
on
the
fenmarket
flats
madge
was
not
awake
until
late
and
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
grey
sky
and
saw
her
finery
tumbled
on
the
further
use
for
it
in
any
shape
save
as
the
dirty
crown
which
she
had
brought
upstairs
lying
on
the
heap
the
leaves
already
fading
she
felt
depressed
and
miserable
the
breakfast
was
dull
and
for
the
most
part
all
three
were
silent
mrs
hopgood
and
clara
went
away
to
begin
their
housework
leaving
madge
alone
madge
cried
mrs
hopgood
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
thing
it
is
of
no
use
to
preserve
it
it
is
dead
and
covered
with
throw
it
down
she
took
it
and
rammed
it
into
the
fire
at
that
moment
she
saw
frank
pass
he
was
evidently
about
to
knock
but
she
ran
to
the
door
and
opened
it
i
did
not
wish
to
keep
you
waiting
in
the
i
am
just
off
but
i
could
not
help
calling
to
see
how
you
are
what
burning
your
laurels
the
testimony
to
your
triumph
triumph
rather
transitory
finishes
in
smoke
and
she
pushed
two
or
three
of
the
unburnt
leaves
amongst
the
ashes
and
covered
them
over
he
stooped
down
picked
up
a
leaf
smoothed
it
between
his
fingers
and
then
raised
his
eyes
they
met
hers
at
that
instant
as
she
lifted
them
and
looked
in
his
face
they
were
near
one
another
and
his
hands
strayed
towards
hers
till
they
touched
she
did
not
withdraw
he
clasped
the
hand
she
not
resisting
in
another
moment
his
arms
were
round
her
his
face
was
on
hers
and
he
was
swept
into
suddenly
the
horn
of
the
coach
about
to
start
awoke
him
and
he
murmured
the
line
from
one
of
his
speeches
of
the
night
but
by
immortal
providence
she
s
she
released
herself
a
trifle
held
her
head
back
as
if
she
desired
to
survey
him
apart
from
her
so
that
the
ecstasy
of
union
might
be
renewed
and
then
fell
on
his
neck
the
horn
once
more
sounded
she
let
him
out
silently
and
he
was
off
mrs
hopgood
and
clara
presently
came
downstairs
mr
palmer
came
in
to
bid
you
but
he
heard
the
coach
and
was
obliged
to
rush
what
a
pity
said
mrs
hopgood
that
you
did
not
call
i
thought
he
would
be
able
to
stay
the
lines
which
followed
frank
s
quotation
came
into
her
head
sweet
lord
you
play
me
no
my
dearest
love
i
would
not
for
the
an
omen
she
said
to
herself
he
would
not
for
the
she
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
all
day
long
when
the
housework
was
over
and
they
were
quiet
together
she
said
now
my
dear
mother
and
sister
i
want
to
know
how
the
performance
pleased
it
was
as
good
as
it
could
be
replied
her
mother
but
i
can
not
think
why
all
plays
should
turn
upon
lovemaking
i
wonder
whether
the
time
will
ever
come
when
we
shall
care
for
a
play
in
which
there
is
no
what
a
horrible
heresy
mother
said
madge
it
may
be
so
it
may
be
that
i
am
growing
old
but
it
seems
astonishing
to
me
sometimes
that
the
world
does
not
grow
a
little
weary
of
endless
variations
on
the
same
never
said
madge
as
long
as
it
does
not
weary
of
the
thing
itself
and
it
is
not
likely
to
do
that
fancy
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
stopping
short
and
exclaiming
this
is
just
what
every
son
of
adam
and
daughter
of
eve
has
gone
through
before
why
should
we
proceed
besides
it
is
the
one
emotion
common
to
the
whole
world
we
can
all
comprehend
it
once
more
it
reveals
character
in
and
for
example
what
is
interesting
is
not
solely
the
bare
love
the
natures
of
hamlet
and
othello
are
brought
to
light
through
it
as
they
would
not
have
been
through
any
other
stimulus
i
am
sure
that
no
ordinary
woman
ever
shows
what
she
really
is
except
when
she
is
in
love
can
you
tell
what
she
is
from
what
she
calls
her
religion
or
from
her
friends
or
even
from
her
husband
would
it
not
be
equally
just
to
say
women
are
more
alike
in
love
than
in
anything
else
mind
i
do
not
say
alike
but
more
alike
is
it
not
the
passion
which
levels
us
all
oh
mother
mother
did
one
ever
hear
such
dreadful
blasphemy
that
the
loves
for
example
of
two
such
cultivated
exquisite
creatures
as
clara
and
myself
would
be
nothing
different
from
those
of
the
barmaids
next
door
well
at
anyrate
i
do
not
want
to
see
children
in
love
to
understand
what
they
me
at
then
if
you
comprehend
us
so
let
us
have
no
more
tell
me
should
i
make
a
good
actress
oh
to
be
able
to
sway
a
thousand
human
beings
into
tears
or
laughter
it
must
be
no
i
do
not
think
you
would
replied
clara
why
not
miss
opinion
mind
was
not
asked
did
i
not
act
to
perfection
last
night
then
why
are
you
so
decisive
try
a
different
part
some
day
i
may
be
you
are
very
she
turned
to
the
piano
played
a
few
chords
closed
the
instrument
swung
herself
round
on
the
music
stool
and
said
she
should
go
for
a
walk
chapter
viii
it
was
mr
palmer
s
design
to
send
frank
abroad
as
soon
as
he
understood
the
home
trade
it
was
thought
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
him
to
learn
something
of
foreign
manufacturing
processes
frank
had
gladly
agreed
to
go
but
he
was
now
rather
in
the
mood
for
delay
mr
palmer
conjectured
a
reason
for
it
and
the
conjecture
was
confirmed
when
after
two
or
three
more
visits
to
fenmarket
perfectly
causeless
so
far
as
business
was
concerned
frank
asked
for
the
paternal
sanction
to
his
engagement
with
madge
consent
was
willingly
given
for
mr
palmer
knew
the
family
well
letters
passed
between
him
and
mrs
hopgood
and
it
was
arranged
that
frank
s
visit
to
germany
should
be
postponed
till
the
summer
he
was
now
frequently
at
fenmarket
as
madge
s
accepted
suitor
and
as
the
spring
advanced
their
evenings
were
mostly
spent
by
themselves
out
of
doors
one
afternoon
they
went
for
a
long
walk
and
on
their
return
they
rested
by
a
stile
those
were
the
days
when
tennyson
was
beginning
to
stir
the
hearts
of
the
young
people
in
england
and
the
two
little
green
volumes
had
just
become
a
treasure
in
the
hopgood
household
mr
palmer
senior
knew
them
well
and
frank
hearing
his
father
speak
so
enthusiastically
about
them
thought
madge
would
like
them
and
had
presented
them
to
her
he
had
heard
one
or
two
read
aloud
at
home
and
had
looked
at
one
or
two
himself
but
had
gone
no
further
madge
her
mother
and
her
sister
had
read
and
them
oh
said
madge
for
that
vale
in
ida
here
in
these
fens
how
i
long
for
something
that
is
not
level
oh
for
the
roar
the
long
brook
falling
thro
the
clov
n
ravine
in
cataract
after
cataract
to
the
go
on
with
it
i
can
not
but
you
know
i
can
not
say
i
do
i
began
frank
how
could
you
begin
it
and
lay
it
down
unfinished
besides
those
lines
are
some
of
the
first
you
behind
the
valley
topmost
gargarus
stands
up
and
takes
the
no
i
do
not
recollect
but
i
will
learn
them
learn
them
for
your
i
do
not
want
you
to
learn
them
for
my
but
i
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
and
his
hand
strayed
to
her
neck
her
head
fell
on
his
shoulder
and
she
had
forgotten
his
ignorance
of
presently
she
awoke
from
her
delicious
trance
and
they
moved
homewards
in
silence
frank
was
a
little
uneasy
i
do
greatly
admire
tennyson
he
said
what
do
you
admire
you
have
hardly
looked
at
i
saw
a
very
good
review
of
him
i
will
look
that
review
up
by
the
way
before
i
come
down
again
mr
maurice
was
talking
about
madge
had
a
desire
to
say
something
but
she
did
not
know
what
to
say
a
burden
lay
upon
her
chest
it
was
that
weight
which
presses
there
when
we
are
alone
with
those
with
whom
we
are
not
strangers
but
with
whom
we
are
not
completely
at
home
and
she
actually
found
herself
impatient
and
of
solitude
this
must
be
criminal
or
disease
she
thought
to
herself
and
she
forcibly
recalled
frank
s
virtues
she
was
so
far
successful
that
when
they
parted
and
he
kissed
her
she
was
more
than
usually
caressing
and
her
ardent
embrace
at
least
for
the
moment
relieved
that
unpleasant
sensation
in
the
region
of
the
heart
when
he
had
gone
she
reasoned
with
herself
what
a
miserable
counterfeit
of
love
she
argued
is
mere
intellectual
sympathy
a
sympathy
based
on
books
what
did
miranda
know
about
ferdinand
s
views
on
this
or
that
subject
love
is
something
independent
of
it
is
an
attraction
which
has
always
been
held
to
be
inexplicable
but
whatever
it
may
be
it
is
not
she
was
becoming
a
little
weary
she
thought
of
what
was
called
these
creatures
whom
we
know
through
shakespeare
and
goethe
are
ghostly
what
have
we
to
do
with
them
it
is
idle
work
to
read
or
even
to
talk
fine
things
about
them
it
ends
in
nothing
what
we
really
have
to
go
through
and
that
which
goes
through
it
are
interesting
but
not
circumstances
and
character
impossible
to
us
when
frank
spoke
of
his
business
which
he
understood
he
was
wise
and
some
observations
which
he
made
the
other
day
on
the
management
of
his
workpeople
would
have
been
thought
original
if
they
had
been
printed
the
true
artist
knows
that
his
hero
must
be
a
character
shaping
events
and
shaped
by
them
and
not
a
babbler
about
literature
frank
also
was
so
susceptible
he
liked
to
hear
her
read
to
him
and
her
enthusiasm
would
soon
be
his
moreover
how
gifted
he
was
unconsciously
with
all
that
makes
a
man
admirable
with
courage
with
perfect
unselfishness
how
handsome
he
was
and
then
his
passion
for
her
she
had
read
something
of
passion
but
she
never
knew
till
now
what
the
white
intensity
of
its
flame
in
a
man
could
be
she
was
committed
too
happily
committed
it
was
an
engagement
thus
whenever
doubt
obtruded
itself
she
poured
a
tide
over
it
and
concealed
it
alas
it
could
not
be
washed
away
it
was
a
little
sharp
rock
based
beneath
the
ocean
s
depths
and
when
the
water
ran
low
its
dark
point
reappeared
she
was
more
successful
however
than
many
women
would
have
been
for
although
her
interest
in
ideas
was
deep
there
was
fire
in
her
blood
and
frank
s
arm
around
her
made
the
world
well
nigh
disappear
her
surrender
was
entire
and
if
sinai
had
thundered
in
her
ears
she
would
not
have
heard
she
was
destitute
of
that
power
which
her
sister
possessed
of
surveying
herself
from
a
distance
on
the
contrary
her
emotion
enveloped
her
and
the
safeguard
of
reflection
on
it
was
impossible
to
her
as
to
frank
no
doubt
ever
approached
him
he
was
intoxicated
and
beside
himself
he
had
been
brought
up
in
a
clean
household
knowing
nothing
of
the
vice
by
which
so
many
young
men
are
overcome
and
woman
hitherto
had
been
a
mystery
to
him
suddenly
he
found
himself
the
possessor
of
a
beautiful
creature
whose
lips
it
was
lawful
to
touch
and
whose
heartbeats
he
could
feel
as
he
pressed
her
to
his
breast
it
was
permitted
him
to
be
alone
with
her
to
sit
on
the
floor
and
rest
his
head
on
her
knees
and
he
had
ventured
to
capture
one
of
her
slippers
and
carry
it
off
to
london
where
he
kept
it
locked
up
amongst
his
treasures
if
he
had
been
drawn
over
fenmarket
sluice
in
a
winter
flood
he
would
not
have
been
more
incapable
of
resistance
every
now
and
then
clara
thought
she
discerned
in
madge
that
she
was
not
entirely
content
but
the
swept
past
so
rapidly
and
were
followed
by
such
dazzling
sunshine
that
she
was
perplexed
and
hoped
that
her
sister
s
occasional
moodiness
might
be
due
to
parting
and
absence
or
the
anticipation
of
them
she
never
ventured
to
say
anything
about
frank
to
madge
for
there
was
something
in
her
which
forbade
all
approach
from
that
side
once
when
he
had
shown
his
ignorance
of
what
was
so
familiar
to
the
hopgoods
and
clara
had
expected
some
sign
of
dissatisfaction
from
her
sister
she
appeared
ostentatiously
to
champion
him
against
anticipated
criticism
clara
interpreted
the
warning
and
was
silent
but
after
she
had
left
the
room
with
her
mother
in
order
that
the
lovers
might
be
alone
she
went
upstairs
and
wept
many
tears
ah
it
is
a
sad
experience
when
the
nearest
and
dearest
suspects
that
we
are
aware
of
secret
disapproval
knows
that
it
is
justifiable
throws
up
a
rampart
and
becomes
defensively
belligerent
from
that
moment
all
confidence
is
at
an
end
without
a
word
perhaps
the
love
and
friendship
of
years
disappear
and
in
the
place
of
two
human
beings
transparent
to
each
other
there
are
two
who
are
opaque
and
indifferent
bitter
bitter
if
the
cause
of
separation
were
definite
disagreement
upon
conduct
or
belief
we
could
pluck
up
courage
approach
and
come
to
an
understanding
but
it
is
impossible
to
bring
to
speech
anything
which
is
so
close
to
the
heart
and
there
is
therefore
nothing
left
for
us
but
to
submit
and
be
dumb
chapter
ix
it
was
now
far
into
june
and
madge
and
frank
extended
their
walks
and
returned
later
he
had
come
down
to
spend
his
last
sunday
with
the
hopgoods
before
starting
with
his
father
for
germany
and
on
the
monday
they
were
to
leave
london
wordsworth
was
one
of
the
divinities
at
stoke
newington
and
just
before
frank
visited
fenmarket
that
week
he
had
heard
the
of
read
with
great
fervour
thinking
that
madge
would
be
pleased
with
him
if
she
found
that
he
knew
something
about
that
famous
ode
and
being
really
smitten
with
some
of
the
passages
in
it
he
learnt
it
and
just
as
they
were
about
to
turn
homewards
one
sultry
evening
he
suddenly
began
to
repeat
it
and
declaimed
it
to
the
end
with
much
rhetorical
power
bravo
said
madge
but
of
all
wordsworth
s
poems
that
is
the
one
for
which
i
believe
i
care
the
frank
s
countenance
fell
oh
me
i
thought
it
was
just
what
would
suit
no
not
particularly
there
are
some
noble
lines
in
it
for
and
custom
lie
upon
thee
with
a
weight
heavy
as
frost
and
deep
almost
as
life
but
the
very
of
immortality
from
recollections
of
early
unmeaning
to
me
and
as
for
the
verse
which
is
in
everybody
s
our
birth
is
but
a
sleep
and
a
forgetting
and
still
worse
the
vision
of
that
immortal
sea
and
of
the
children
who
sport
upon
the
shore
they
convey
nothing
whatever
to
me
i
find
though
they
are
much
admired
by
the
clergy
of
the
better
sort
and
by
certain
people
to
whom
thinking
is
distasteful
or
impossible
because
they
can
not
definitely
believe
they
fling
themselves
with
all
the
more
fervour
upon
these
cloudy
wordsworthian
phrases
and
imagine
they
see
something
solid
in
the
coloured
it
was
now
growing
dark
and
a
few
heavy
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
but
in
a
minute
or
two
they
ceased
frank
contrary
to
his
usual
wont
was
silent
there
was
something
undiscovered
in
madge
a
region
which
he
had
not
visited
and
perhaps
could
not
enter
she
discerned
in
an
instant
what
she
had
done
and
in
an
instant
repented
he
had
taken
so
much
pains
with
a
long
piece
of
poetry
for
her
sake
was
not
that
better
than
agreement
in
a
set
of
propositions
scores
of
persons
might
think
as
she
thought
about
the
ode
who
would
not
spend
a
moment
in
doing
anything
to
gratify
her
it
was
delightful
also
to
reflect
that
frank
imagined
she
would
sympathise
with
anything
written
in
that
temper
she
recalled
what
she
herself
had
said
when
somebody
gave
clara
a
copy
in
parian
of
a
greek
statue
a
thing
coarse
in
outline
and
vulgar
clara
was
about
to
put
it
in
a
cupboard
in
the
attic
but
madge
had
pleaded
so
pathetically
that
the
donor
had
in
a
measure
divined
what
her
sister
loved
and
had
done
her
best
although
she
had
made
a
mistake
that
finally
the
statue
was
placed
on
the
bedroom
mantelpiece
madge
s
heart
overflowed
and
frank
had
never
attracted
her
so
powerfully
as
at
that
moment
she
took
his
hand
softly
in
hers
frank
she
murmured
as
she
bent
her
head
towards
him
it
is
really
a
lovely
suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
forked
lightning
at
some
distance
followed
in
a
few
seconds
by
a
roll
of
thunder
increasing
in
intensity
until
the
last
reverberation
seemed
to
shake
the
ground
they
took
refuge
in
a
little
barn
and
sat
down
madge
who
was
timid
and
excited
in
a
thunderstorm
closed
her
eyes
to
shield
herself
from
the
glare
the
tumult
in
the
heavens
lasted
for
nearly
two
hours
and
when
it
was
over
madge
and
frank
walked
homewards
without
speaking
a
word
for
a
good
part
of
the
way
i
can
not
can
not
go
he
suddenly
cried
as
they
neared
the
town
you
go
she
replied
calmly
but
madge
think
of
me
in
germany
think
what
my
dreams
and
thoughts
will
of
miles
between
she
had
never
seen
him
so
shaken
with
terror
you
go
not
another
i
must
say
can
i
say
my
god
my
god
have
mercy
on
me
mercy
mercy
she
repeated
half
unconsciously
and
then
rousing
herself
exclaimed
you
shall
not
say
it
i
will
not
hear
now
they
had
come
to
the
door
he
went
inside
she
took
his
face
between
her
hands
left
one
kiss
on
his
forehead
led
him
back
to
the
doorway
and
he
heard
the
bolts
drawn
when
he
recovered
himself
he
went
to
the
crown
and
sceptre
and
tried
to
write
a
letter
to
her
but
the
words
looked
hateful
horrible
on
the
paper
and
they
were
not
the
words
he
wanted
he
dared
not
go
near
the
house
the
next
morning
but
as
he
passed
it
on
the
coach
he
looked
at
the
windows
nobody
was
to
be
seen
and
that
night
he
left
england
did
you
hear
said
clara
to
her
mother
at
breakfast
that
the
lightning
struck
one
of
the
elms
in
the
avenue
at
mrs
martin
s
yesterday
evening
and
splintered
it
to
the
ground
chapter
x
in
a
few
days
madge
received
the
following
letter
frankfort
hôtel
waidenbusch
my
dearest
madge
do
not
know
how
to
write
to
you
i
have
begun
a
dozen
letters
but
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
speak
of
what
lies
before
me
hiding
the
whole
world
from
me
forgiveness
how
is
any
forgiveness
possible
but
madge
my
dearest
madge
remember
that
my
love
is
intenser
than
ever
what
has
happened
has
bound
you
closer
to
me
i
you
to
let
me
come
back
i
will
find
a
thousand
excuses
for
returning
and
we
will
marry
we
had
vowed
marriage
to
each
other
and
why
should
not
our
vows
be
fulfilled
marriage
marriage
you
will
not
you
no
you
you
must
see
you
can
not
refuse
my
father
wishes
to
make
this
town
his
headquarters
for
ten
days
write
by
return
for
mercy
s
ever
devoted
the
reply
came
only
a
day
late
my
dear
frank
who
is
to
be
forgiven
not
you
you
believed
you
loved
me
but
i
doubted
my
love
and
i
know
now
that
no
true
love
for
you
exists
we
must
part
and
part
forever
whatever
wrong
may
have
been
done
marriage
to
avoid
disgrace
would
be
a
wrong
to
both
of
us
infinitely
greater
i
owe
you
an
expiation
your
release
is
all
i
can
offer
and
it
is
insufficient
i
can
only
plead
that
i
was
deaf
and
blind
by
some
miracle
i
can
not
tell
how
my
ears
and
eyes
are
opened
and
i
hear
and
see
it
is
not
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
the
truth
has
been
revealed
to
me
suddenly
supernaturally
i
may
say
as
if
in
a
vision
and
i
know
the
revelation
is
authentic
there
must
be
no
wavering
no
and
i
absolutely
forbid
another
letter
from
you
if
one
arrives
i
must
for
the
sake
of
my
own
peace
and
resolution
refuse
to
read
it
you
have
simply
to
announce
to
your
father
that
the
engagement
is
at
an
end
and
give
no
faithful
friend
madge
another
letter
did
come
but
madge
was
true
to
her
word
and
it
was
returned
unopened
for
a
long
time
frank
was
almost
incapable
of
reflection
he
dwelt
on
an
event
which
might
happen
but
which
he
dared
not
name
and
if
it
should
happen
pictures
of
his
father
his
home
his
father
s
friends
fenmarket
the
hopgood
household
passed
before
him
with
such
wild
rapidity
and
intermingled
complexity
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
reins
had
dropped
out
of
his
hands
and
he
was
being
hurried
away
to
madness
he
resisted
with
all
his
might
this
dreadful
sweep
of
the
imagination
tried
to
bring
himself
back
into
sanity
and
to
devise
schemes
by
which
although
he
was
prohibited
from
writing
to
madge
he
might
obtain
news
of
her
her
injunction
might
not
be
final
there
was
but
one
hope
for
him
one
possibility
of
extrication
one
marriage
it
be
he
dared
not
think
of
what
might
be
the
consequences
if
they
did
not
marry
hitherto
madge
had
given
no
explanation
to
her
mother
or
sister
of
the
rupture
but
one
two
months
had
now
did
not
appear
at
breakfast
clara
is
not
here
said
mrs
hopgood
she
was
very
tired
last
night
perhaps
it
is
better
not
to
disturb
oh
no
please
let
her
alone
i
will
see
if
she
still
madge
went
upstairs
opened
her
sister
s
door
noiselessly
saw
that
she
was
not
awake
and
returned
when
breakfast
was
over
she
rose
and
after
walking
up
and
down
the
room
once
or
twice
seated
herself
in
the
armchair
by
her
mother
s
side
her
mother
drew
herself
a
little
nearer
and
took
madge
s
hand
gently
in
her
own
madge
my
child
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
your
mother
can
not
you
tell
me
why
frank
and
you
have
parted
do
you
not
think
i
ought
to
know
something
about
such
an
event
in
the
life
of
one
so
close
to
me
i
broke
off
the
engagement
we
were
not
suited
to
one
i
thought
as
much
i
honour
you
a
thousand
times
better
that
you
should
separate
now
than
find
out
your
mistake
afterwards
when
it
is
irrevocable
thank
god
he
has
given
you
such
courage
but
you
must
have
know
you
must
and
she
tenderly
kissed
her
daughter
oh
mother
mother
cried
madge
what
is
the
least
worst
that
can
happen
to
a
woman
mrs
hopgood
did
not
speak
something
presented
itself
which
she
refused
to
recognise
but
she
shuddered
before
she
could
recover
herself
madge
broke
out
again
it
has
happened
to
me
mother
your
daughter
has
wrecked
your
peace
for
ever
and
he
has
abandoned
you
no
no
i
told
you
it
was
i
who
left
it
was
mrs
hopgood
s
custom
when
any
evil
news
was
suddenly
communicated
to
her
to
withdraw
at
once
if
possible
to
her
own
room
she
detached
herself
from
madge
rose
and
without
a
word
went
upstairs
and
locked
her
door
the
struggle
was
terrible
so
much
thought
so
much
care
such
an
education
such
noble
qualities
and
they
had
not
accomplished
what
ordinary
ignorant
fenmarket
mothers
and
daughters
were
able
to
achieve
this
fine
life
then
was
a
failure
and
a
perfect
example
of
literary
and
artistic
training
had
gone
the
way
of
the
common
wenches
whose
affiliation
cases
figured
in
the
county
newspaper
she
was
shaken
and
bewildered
she
was
neither
orthodox
nor
secular
she
was
too
strong
to
be
afraid
that
what
she
disbelieved
could
be
true
and
yet
a
fatal
weakness
had
been
disclosed
in
what
had
been
set
up
as
its
substitute
she
could
not
treat
her
child
as
a
sinner
who
was
to
be
tortured
into
something
like
madness
by
immitigable
punishment
but
on
the
other
hand
she
felt
that
this
sorrow
was
unlike
other
sorrows
and
that
it
could
never
be
healed
for
some
time
she
was
powerless
blown
this
way
and
that
way
by
contradictory
storms
and
unable
to
determine
herself
to
any
point
whatever
she
was
not
however
new
to
the
tempest
she
had
lived
and
had
survived
when
she
thought
she
must
have
gone
down
she
had
learned
the
wisdom
which
the
passage
through
desperate
straits
can
bring
at
last
she
prayed
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
message
was
whispered
to
her
she
went
into
the
and
seated
herself
again
by
madge
neither
uttered
a
word
but
madge
fell
down
before
her
and
with
a
great
cry
buried
her
face
in
her
mother
s
lap
she
remained
kneeling
for
some
time
waiting
for
a
rebuke
but
none
came
presently
she
felt
smoothing
hands
on
her
head
and
the
soft
impress
of
lips
so
was
she
judged
chapter
xi
it
was
settled
that
they
should
leave
fenmarket
their
departure
caused
but
little
surprise
they
had
scarcely
any
friends
and
it
was
always
conjectured
that
people
so
peculiar
would
ultimately
find
their
way
to
london
they
were
particularly
desirous
to
conceal
their
movements
and
therefore
determined
to
warehouse
their
furniture
in
town
to
take
furnished
apartments
there
for
three
months
and
then
to
move
elsewhere
any
letters
which
might
arrive
at
fenmarket
for
them
during
these
three
months
would
be
sent
to
them
at
their
new
address
nothing
probably
would
come
afterwards
and
as
nobody
in
fenmarket
would
care
to
take
any
trouble
about
them
their
trace
would
become
obliterated
they
found
some
rooms
near
myddelton
square
pentonville
not
a
particularly
cheerful
place
but
they
wished
to
avoid
a
more
distant
suburb
and
pentonville
was
cheap
fortunately
for
them
they
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
getting
rid
of
the
fenmarket
house
for
the
remainder
of
their
term
for
a
little
while
london
diverted
them
after
a
fashion
but
the
absence
of
household
cares
told
upon
them
they
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
read
and
to
take
dismal
walks
through
islington
and
barnsbury
and
the
gloom
of
the
outlook
thickened
as
the
days
became
shorter
and
the
smoke
began
to
darken
the
air
madge
was
naturally
more
oppressed
than
the
others
not
only
by
reason
of
her
temperament
but
because
she
was
the
author
of
the
trouble
which
had
befallen
them
her
mother
and
clara
did
everything
to
sustain
and
to
cheer
her
they
possessed
the
rare
virtue
of
continuous
tenderness
the
love
which
with
many
is
an
inspiration
was
with
them
their
own
selves
from
which
they
could
not
be
separated
a
harsh
word
could
not
therefore
escape
from
them
it
was
as
impossible
as
that
there
should
be
any
failure
in
the
pressure
with
which
the
rocks
press
towards
the
earth
s
centre
madge
at
times
was
very
far
gone
in
melancholy
how
different
this
thing
looked
when
it
was
close
at
hand
when
she
personally
was
to
be
the
victim
she
had
read
about
it
in
history
the
surface
of
which
it
seemed
scarcely
to
ripple
it
had
been
turned
to
music
in
some
of
her
favourite
poems
and
had
lent
a
charm
to
innumerable
mythologies
but
the
actual
fact
was
nothing
like
the
poetry
or
mythology
and
threatened
to
ruin
her
own
history
altogether
nor
would
it
be
her
own
history
solely
but
more
or
less
that
of
her
mother
and
sister
had
she
believed
in
the
common
creed
her
attention
would
have
been
concentrated
on
the
salvation
of
her
own
soul
she
would
have
found
her
redeemer
and
would
have
been
comparatively
at
peace
she
would
have
acknowledged
herself
convicted
of
infinite
sin
and
hell
would
have
been
opened
before
her
but
above
the
sin
and
the
hell
she
would
have
seen
the
distinct
image
of
the
mediator
abolishing
both
popular
theology
makes
personal
salvation
of
such
immense
importance
that
in
comparison
therewith
we
lose
sight
of
the
consequences
to
others
of
our
misdeeds
the
sense
of
cruel
injustice
to
those
who
loved
her
remained
with
madge
perpetually
to
obtain
relief
she
often
went
out
of
london
for
the
day
sometimes
her
mother
and
sister
went
with
her
sometimes
she
insisted
on
going
alone
one
autumn
morning
she
found
herself
at
letherhead
the
longest
trip
she
had
undertaken
for
there
were
scarcely
any
railways
then
she
wandered
about
till
she
discovered
a
footpath
which
took
her
to
a
which
spread
itself
out
into
a
little
lake
it
was
fed
by
springs
which
burst
up
through
the
ground
she
watched
at
one
particular
point
and
saw
the
water
boil
up
with
such
force
that
it
cleared
a
space
of
a
dozen
yards
in
diameter
from
every
weed
and
formed
a
transparent
pool
just
tinted
with
that
pale
azure
which
is
peculiar
to
the
living
fountains
which
break
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
chalk
she
was
fascinated
for
a
moment
by
the
spectacle
and
reflected
upon
it
but
she
passed
on
in
about
of
an
hour
she
found
herself
near
a
church
larger
than
an
ordinary
village
church
and
as
she
was
tired
and
the
gate
of
the
church
porch
was
open
she
entered
and
sat
down
the
sun
streamed
in
upon
her
and
some
sheep
which
had
strayed
into
the
churchyard
from
the
adjoining
open
field
came
almost
close
to
her
unalarmed
and
looked
in
her
face
the
quiet
was
complete
and
the
air
so
still
that
a
yellow
leaf
dropping
here
and
there
from
the
churchyard
beginning
to
quiveringly
in
a
straight
path
to
the
earth
sick
at
heart
and
despairing
she
could
not
help
being
touched
and
she
thought
to
herself
how
strange
the
world
transcendent
both
in
glory
and
horror
a
world
capable
of
such
scenes
as
those
before
her
and
a
world
in
which
such
suffering
as
hers
could
be
a
world
infinite
both
ways
the
porch
gate
was
open
because
the
organist
was
about
to
practise
and
in
another
instant
she
was
listening
to
the
from
beethoven
s
mass
in
she
knew
it
frank
had
tried
to
give
her
some
notion
of
it
on
the
piano
and
since
she
had
been
in
london
she
had
heard
it
at
st
mary
s
moorfields
she
broke
down
and
wept
but
there
was
something
new
in
her
sorrow
and
it
seemed
as
if
a
certain
pity
overshadowed
her
she
had
barely
recovered
herself
when
she
saw
a
woman
apparently
about
fifty
coming
towards
her
with
a
wicker
basket
on
her
arm
she
sat
down
beside
madge
put
her
basket
on
the
ground
and
wiped
her
face
with
her
apron
marnin
miss
its
rayther
hot
walkin
isn
t
it
i
ve
come
all
the
way

longish
step
there

and
then
when

letherhead
i

lift

and
motherly

great
oakhurst

my
husband

left
alone
and
didn

oakhurst

the

too
big
for

and
there

nobody

when
i
goes
over
to
darkin
for

most
of
the
folk

going
back
this
her
interrogator
was
puzzled
and
her
curiosity
stimulated
presently
she
looked
in
madge
s
face
ah
my
poor
dear
you
ll
excuse
me
i
don
t
mean
to
be
forward
but
i
see
you
ve
been
there
s
somebody
buried
that
was
all
she
could
say
the
walk
from
letherhead
and
the
excitement
had
been
too
much
for
her
and
she
fainted
mrs
caffyn
for
that
was
her
name
was
used
to
fainting
fits
she
was
often
a
bit
faint
herself
and
she
instantly
loosened
madge
s
gown
brought
out
some
and
also
a
little
bottle
of
brandy
and
water
something
suddenly
struck
her
she
took
up
madge
s
hand
there
was
no
wedding
ring
on
it
presently
her
patient
recovered
herself
look
you
now
my
dear
you
aren
t
noways
fit
to
go
back
to
london
if
you
was
my
child

do
it
for
all
the
gold
in
the
indies

n
t

have
a
wink
of
sleep

night
if

if
anything
were
to
happen
to
you
it
would
be
me

i

i
was
just
to
send
a
little
parcel
up
to
my
daughter
by
the
coach
and
her
husband
s
to
meet
it
she
d
left
something
behind
last
week
when
she
was
with
me
and
i
thought
i

a
bit
of
fresh
butter
here
for
her
and
put
along
with
it
they
make
better
butter
in

oakhurst

just
into
letherhead
and
then
you
can
ride
to
great
oakhurst
it
s
only
about
two
miles
and
you
can
stay
there
all
madge
was
greatly
touched
she
took
mrs
caffyn
s
hands
in
hers
pressed
them
both
and
consented
she
was
very
weary
and
the
stamp
on
mrs
caffyn
s
countenance
was
indubitable
it
was
evidently
no
forgery
but
of
royal
mintage
they
walked
slowly
to
letherhead
and
there
they
found
the
carrier
s
cart
which
took
them
to
great
oakhurst
chapter
xii
mrs
caffyn
s
house
was
a
roomy
old
cottage
near
the
church
with
a
in
which
were
displayed
bottles
of
suckers
and
of
day
martin
s
blacking
cotton
stuffs
a
bag
of
nuts
and
some
mugs
cups
and
saucers
inside
were
salt
butter
drapery
treacle
starch
tea
tobacco
and
snuff
cheese
matches
bacon
and
a
few
drugs
such
as
black
draught
magnesia
pills
sulphur
dalby
s
carminative
and
there
was
also
a
small
stock
of
string
and
tin
ware
a
boy
was
behind
the
counter
when
mrs
caffyn
was
out
he
always
asked
the
customers
who
desired
any
article
the
sale
of
which
was
in
any
degree
an
art
to
call
again
when
she
returned
he
went
as
far
as
those
things
which
were
put
up
in
packets
such
as
what
were
called
grits
for
making
gruel
and
he
was
also
authorised
to
venture
on
pennyworths
of
liquorice
and
peppermints
but
the
sale
of
yards
of
cotton
print
was
as
much
above
him
as
the
negotiation
of
a
treaty
of
peace
would
be
to
a
messenger
in
the
foreign
office
in
fact
nobody
excepting
children
went
into
the
shop
when
mrs
caffyn
was
not
to
be
seen
there
and
if
she
had
to
go
to
dorking
or
letherhead
on
business
she
always
chose
the
middle
of
the
day
when
the
folk
were
busy
at
their
homes
or
in
the
fields
poor
woman
she
was
much
tried
half
the
people
who
dealt
with
her
were
in
her
debt
but
she
could
not
press
them
for
her
money
during
they
were
discharged
by
the
score
from
their
farms
but
as
they
were
not
sufficiently
philosophic
or
sufficiently
considerate
for
their
fellows
to
hang
or
drown
themselves
they
were
obliged
to
consume
food
and
to
wear
clothes
for
which
they
tried
to
pay
by
instalments
during
spring
summer
and
autumn
mrs
caffyn
managed
to
make
both
ends
meet
by
the
help
of
two
or
three
pigs
by
great
economy
and
by
letting
some
of
her
superfluous
rooms
great
oakhurst
was
not
a
show
place
nor
a
spa
but
the
letherhead
doctor
had
once
recommended
her
to
a
physician
in
london
who
occasionally
sent
her
a
patient
who
wanted
nothing
but
rest
and
fresh
air
she
also
during
the
was
often
asked
to
find
a
bedroom
for
visitors
to
the
towers
she
might
have
done
better
had
she
been
on
thoroughly
good
terms
with
the
parson
she
attended
church
on
sunday
morning
with
tolerable
regularity
she
never
went
inside
a
dissenting
chapel
and
was
not
heretical
on
any
definite
theological
point
but
the
rector
and
she
were
not
friends
she
had
lived
in
surrey
ever
since
she
was
a
child
but
she
was
not
surrey
born
both
her
father
and
mother
came
from
the
north
country
and
migrated
southwards
when
she
was
very
young
they
were
better
educated
than
the
southerners
amongst
whom
they
came
and
although
their
daughter
had
no
schooling
beyond
what
was
obtainable
in
a
surrey
village
of
that
time
she
was
distinguished
by
a
certain
superiority
which
she
had
inherited
or
acquired
from
her
parents
she
was
never
subservient
to
the
rector
after
the
fashion
of
her
neighbours
she
never
curtsied
to
him
and
if
he
passed
and
nodded
she
said
marnin
sir
in
just
the
same
tone
as
that
in
which
she
said
it
to
the
smallest
of
the
great
oakhurst
farmers
her
was
an
official
duty
incumbent
upon
her
as
the
proprietor
of
the
only
shop
in
the
parish
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
church
matters
except
on
sunday
and
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
neglect
to
send
for
the
rector
when
one
of
her
children
lay
dying
she
was
attacked
for
the
omission
but
she
defended
herself
what
was
the
use
when
the
poor
dear
was
only
seven
year
old
what
call
was
there
for
him
to
come
to
a
blessed
innocent
like
that
i
did
tell
him
to
look
in
when
my
husband
was
took
for
i
know
as
before
we
were
married
there
was
something
atween
him
and
that
gal
sanders
he
never
would
own
up
to
me
about
it
and
i
thought
as
he
might
to
a
clergyman
and
if
he
did
it
would
ease
his
mind
and
make
it
a
bit
better
for
him
afterwards
but
lord
it
warn
t
no
use
for
he
went
off
and
we
didn
t
so
much
as
hear
her
name
not
even
when
he
was
i
says
to
myself
when
the
parson
left
what
s
the
good
of
having
you
mrs
caffyn
was
a
christian
but
she
was
a
disciple
of
st
james
rather
than
of
st
paul
she
believed
of
course
the
doctrines
of
the
catechism
in
the
sense
that
she
denied
none
and
would
have
assented
to
all
if
she
had
been
questioned
thereon
but
her
belief
that
faith
if
it
hath
not
works
is
dead
being
alone
was
something
very
vivid
and
very
practical
her
estimate
too
of
the
relative
values
of
the
virtues
and
of
the
relative
sinfulness
of
sins
was
original
and
the
rector
therefore
told
all
his
parishioners
that
she
was
little
better
than
a
heathen
the
common
failings
in
that
part
of
the
country
amongst
the
poor
were
drunkenness
and
looseness
in
the
relations
between
the
young
men
and
young
women
mrs
caffyn
s
indignation
never
rose
to
the
correct
boiling
point
against
these
crimes
the
rector
once
ventured
to
say
as
the
case
was
next
door
to
her
it
is
very
sad
is
it
not
mrs
caffyn
that
polesden
should
be
so
addicted
to
drink
i
hope
he
did
not
disturb
you
last
saturday
night
i
have
given
the
constable
directions
to
look
after
the
street
more
closely
on
saturday
evening
and
if
polesden
again
offends
he
must
be
taken
mrs
caffyn
was
behind
her
own
counter
she
had
just
served
a
customer
with
two
ounces
of
dutch
cheese
and
she
sat
down
on
her
stool
being
rather
a
heavy
woman
she
always
sat
down
when
she
was
not
busy
and
she
never
rose
merely
to
talk
yes
it
is
sad
sir
and
polesden
isn
t
no
particular
friend
of
mine
but
i
tell
you
what
s
sad
too
sir
and
that
s
the
way
them
people
are
mucked
up
in
that
cottage
why
their
living
room
opens
straight
on
the
road
and
the
wind
comes
in
fit
to
blow
your
head
off
and
when
he
goes
home
o
nights
there
s
them
children
and
he
can
t
bide
there
and
do
i
am
afraid
though
mrs
caffyn
there
must
be
something
radically
wrong
with
that
family
i
suppose
you
know
all
about
the
eldest
daughter
yes
sir
i
heard
it
it
wouldn
t
be
great
oakhurst
if
i
hadn
t
but
p
r
aps
sir
you
ve
never
been
upstairs
in
that
house
and
yet
a
house
it
isn
t
there
s
just
two
that
s
all
it
s
shameful
it
isn
t
decent
well
that
gal
she
goes
away
to
service
maybe
sir
them
premises
at
the
farm
are
also
unbeknown
to
you
in
the
back
kitchen
there
s
a
broadish
sort
of
shelf
as
jim
climbs
into
o
nights
and
it
has
a
rail
round
it
to
keep
you
from
out
and
there
s
a
ladder
as
they
draws
up
in
the
day
as
goes
straight
up
from
that
kitchen
to
the
gal
s
bedroom
door
it
s
downright
disgraceful
and
i
don
t
believe
the
lord
a
mighty
would
be
marciful
to
neither
of
if
we
was
tried
like
mrs
caffyn
bethought
herself
of
the
us
and
was
afraid
that
even
she
had
gone
a
little
too
far
leastways
speaking
for
myself
sir
she
added
the
rector
turned
rather
red
and
repented
his
attempt
to
enlist
mrs
caffyn
if
the
temptations
are
so
great
mrs
caffyn
that
is
all
the
more
reason
why
those
who
are
liable
to
them
should
seek
the
means
which
are
provided
in
order
that
they
may
be
overcome
i
believe
the
polesdens
are
very
lax
attendants
at
church
and
i
don
t
think
they
ever
mrs
polesden
at
that
moment
came
in
for
an
ounce
of
tea
and
as
mrs
caffyn
rose
to
weigh
it
the
rector
departed
with
a
stiff
made
to
do
duty
for
both
women
chapter
xiii
mrs
caffyn
persuaded
madge
to
go
to
bed
at
once
after
giving
her
something
to
comfort
in
the
morning
her
kind
hostess

to
her
bedside

very
good
to
me
what

get
something
out

i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
madge
took
mrs
caffyn
s
hand
in
hers
and
pressed
it
firmly
besides
my
dear
said
mrs

the
sheets

as
i

pretty
well
what
it
madge
turned
round
in
the
bed
so
as
no
longer
to

the
light
mrs
caffyn
sat
between
her
and
the
window
look

here
my
dear
don

meant
to

moment

was
drawed
to
you
like
i
couldn
t

i
just
wanted
you
to
know
as
it
makes
no
difference
that
s
like
me
sometimes
i
m
drawed
that
way
and
sometimes
t
other
way
and
it

never
no
use
for

to
try
to
go
against
it
i
ain
t
to
say
anything
more
to
you
mighty
he
s
above
us
all
but
p
r
aps
you
may
be
comm
this
way
again
some
day
and
then
you
ll
look
madge
turned
again
to
the
light
and
again
caught
mrs
caffyn
s
hand
but
was
silent
the
next
morning
after
madge
s
return
mrs
cork
the
landlady
presented
herself
at
the
door
and
wished
to
speak
with
mrs
hopgood
for
a
come
in
mrs
thank
you
ma
am
but
i
prefer
as
you
should
come
mrs
cork
was
about
forty
a
widow
with
no
children
she
had
a
face
of
which
it
was
impossible
to
recollect
when
it
had
been
seen
even
a
dozen
times
any
feature
except
the
eyes
which
were
a
little
bluer
than
the
faceted
head
of
the
steel
poker
in
her
parlour
but
just
as
hard
she
lived
in
the
basement
with
a
maid
much
like
herself
but
a
little
more
human
although
the
front
underground
room
was
furnished
mrs
cork
never
used
it
except
on
the
rarest
occasions
and
a
kind
of
apron
of
coloured
paper
hung
over
the
fireplace
nearly
all
the
year
she
was
a
woman
of
what
she
called
regular
habits
no
lodger
was
ever
permitted
to
transgress
her
rules
or
to
have
meals
ten
minutes
before
or
ten
minutes
after
the
appointed
time
she
had
undoubtedly
been
married
but
who
cork
could
have
been
was
a
marvel
why
he
died
and
why
there
were
never
any
children
were
no
marvels
at
two
o
clock
her
grate
was
screwed
up
to
the
narrowest
possible
dimensions
and
the
ashes
potato
peelings
tea
leaves
and
cabbage
stalks
were
thrown
on
the
poor
struggling
coals
no
meat
by
the
way
was
ever
was
considered
was
baked
or
boiled
after
four
not
a
bit
of
anything
that
was
not
cold
was
allowed
till
the
next
morning
and
indeed
from
the
first
of
april
to
the
of
october
the
fire
was
raked
out
the
moment
tea
was
over
mrs
hopgood
one
night
was
not
very
well
and
clara
wished
to
give
her
mother
something
warm
she
rang
the
bell
and
asked
for
hot
water
maria
came
up
and
disappeared
without
a
word
after
receiving
the
message
presently
she
returned
mrs
cork
miss
wishes
me
to
tell
you
as
it
was
never
understood
as
ot
water
would
be
required
after
tea
and
she
hasn
t
got
mrs
hopgood
had
a
fire
although
it
was
not
yet
the
of
october
for
it
was
very
damp
and
raw
she
had
with
much
difficulty
induced
mrs
cork
to
concede
this
favour
which
probably
would
not
have
been
granted
if
the
coals
had
not
yielded
a
profit
of
threepence
a
scuttleful
and
clara
therefore
asked
if
she
could
not
have
the
kettle
upstairs
again
maria
disappeared
and
returned
mrs
cork
says
miss
as
it
s
very
as
the
kettle
is
cleaned
up
agin
and
if
you
can
do
without
it
she
will
be
it
was
of
no
use
to
continue
the
contest
and
clara
bethought
herself
of
a
little
etna
she
had
in
her
bedroom
she
went
to
the
druggist
s
bought
some
methylated
spirit
and
obtained
what
she
wanted
mrs
cork
had
one
virtue
and
one
weakness
her
virtue
was
cleanliness
but
she
persecuted
the
blacks
not
because
she
objected
to
dirt
as
dirt
but
because
it
was
unauthorised
appeared
without
permission
at
irregular
hours
and
because
the
glittering
polish
on
varnished
paint
and
red
mahogany
was
a
pleasure
to
her
she
liked
the
dirt
too
in
a
way
for
she
enjoyed
the
exercise
of
her
on
it
and
the
pursuit
of
it
to
destruction
her
weakness
was
an
enormous
which
had
a
bell
round
its
neck
and
slept
in
a
basket
in
the
kitchen
the
and
most
moral
cat
in
the
parish
at
nine
every
evening
it
was
let
out
into
the
and
vanished
at
ten
precisely
it
was
heard
to
mew
and
was
immediately
admitted
not
once
in
a
twelvemonth
did
that
cat
prolong
its
love
making
after
five
minutes
to
ten
mrs
hopgood
went
upstairs
to
her
room
mrs
cork
following
and
closing
the
door
if
you
please
ma
am
i
wish
to
give
you
notice
to
leave
this
day
what
is
the
matter
mrs
cork
well
ma
am
for
one
thing
i
didn
t
know
as
you
d
bring
a
bird
with
it
was
a
pet
bird
belonging
to
madge
but
what
harm
does
the
bird
do
it
gives
no
trouble
my
daughter
attends
to
yes
ma
am
but
it
worrits
my
cat
i
mean
i
found
him
the
other
mornin
on
the
table
eyin
it
and
i
can
t
to
see
him
i
should
hardly
have
thought
that
a
reason
for
parting
with
good
mrs
hopgood
had
intended
to
move
as
before
explained
but
she
did
not
wish
to
go
till
the
three
months
had
expired
i
don
t
say
as
that
is
everything
but
if
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
the
truth
miss
madge
is
not
a
person
as
i
like
to
keep
in
the
house
i
wish
you
to
know
cork
suddenly
became
excited
and
that
i
m
a
respectable
woman
and
have
always
let
my
apartments
to
respectable
people
and
do
you
think
i
should
ever
let
them
to
respectable
people
again
if
it
got
about
as
i
had
had
anybody
as
wasn
t
respectable
where
was
she
last
night
and
do
you
suppose
as
me
as
has
been
a
married
woman
can
t
see
the
condition
she
s
in
i
say
as
you
mrs
hopgood
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
bringing
of
such
a
person
into
a
house
like
mine
and
you
ll
please
vacate
these
premises
on
the
day
she
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
but
banged
the
door
after
her
and
went
down
to
her
subterranean
den
mrs
hopgood
did
not
tell
her
children
the
true
reason
for
leaving
she
merely
said
that
mrs
cork
had
been
very
impertinent
and
that
they
must
look
out
for
other
rooms
madge
instantly
recollected
great
ormond
street
but
she
did
not
know
the
number
and
oddly
enough
she
had
completely
forgotten
mrs
caffyn
s
name
it
was
a
peculiar
name
she
had
heard
it
only
once
she
had
not
noticed
it
over
the
door
and
her
exhaustion
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
her
loss
of
memory
she
could
not
therefore
write
and
mrs
hopgood
determined
that
she
herself
would
go
to
great
oakhurst
she
had
another
reason
for
her
journey
she
wished
her
kind
friend
there
to
see
that
madge
had
really
a
mother
who
cared
for
her
she
was
anxious
to
confirm
madge
s
story
and
mrs
caffyn
s
confidence
clara
desired
to
go
also
but
mrs
hopgood
would
not
leave
madge
alone
and
the
expense
of
a
double
fare
was
considered
unnecessary
when
mrs
hopgood
came
to
letherhead
on
her
return
the
coach
was
full
inside
and
she
was
obliged
to
ride
outside
although
the
weather
was
cold
and
threatening
in
about
half
an
hour
it
began
to
rain
heavily
and
by
the
time
she
was
in
pentonville
she
was
wet
through
the
next
morning
she
ought
to
have
lain
in
bed
but
she
came
down
at
her
accustomed
hour
as
mrs
cork
was
more
than
usually
disagreeable
and
it
was
settled
that
they
would
leave
at
once
if
the
rooms
in
great
ormond
street
were
available
clara
went
there
directly
after
breakfast
and
saw
mrs
marshall
who
had
already
received
an
introductory
letter
from
her
mother
chapter
xiv
the
marshall
family
included
marshall
and
his
wife
he
was
rather
a
small
man
with
blackish
hair
small
lips
and
with
a
nose
just
a
little
turned
up
at
the
tip
as
we
have
been
informed
he
was
a
he
worked
for
very
good
shops
and
earned
about
two
pounds
a
week
he
read
books
but
he
did
not
know
their
value
and
often
fancied
he
had
made
a
great
discovery
on
a
bookstall
of
an
author
long
ago
superseded
and
worthless
he
belonged
to
a
mechanic
s
institute
and
was
fond
of
animal
physiology
heard
courses
of
lectures
on
it
at
the
institute
and
had
studied
two
or
three
elementary
handbooks
he
found
in
a
dealer
s
shop
a
model
which
could
be
taken
to
pieces
of
the
inside
of
the
human
body
he
had
also
bought
a
diagram
of
a
man
showing
the
circulation
and
this
he
had
hung
in
his
bedroom
his
objecting
most
strongly
on
the
ground
that
its
effect
on
his
wife
was
injurious
he
had
a
notion
that
the
world
might
be
regenerated
if
men
and
women
were
properly
instructed
in
physiological
science
and
if
before
marriage
they
would
study
their
own
physical
peculiarities
and
those
of
their
intended
partners
the
crossing
of
peculiarities
nevertheless
presented
difficulties
a
man
with
long
legs
surely
ought
to
choose
a
woman
with
short
legs
but
if
a
man
who
was
mathematical
married
a
woman
who
was
mathematical
the
result
might
be
a
mathematical
prodigy
on
the
other
hand
the
parents
of
the
prodigy
might
each
have
corresponding
qualities
which
mixed
with
the
mathematical
tendency
would
completely
nullify
it
the
path
of
duty
therefore
was
by
no
means
plain
however
marshall
was
sure
that
great
cities
dwarfed
their
inhabitants
and
as
he
himself
was
not
so
tall
as
his
father
and
moreover
suffered
from
bad
digestion
and
had
a
tendency
to
run
to
head
he
determined
to
select
as
his
wife
a
daughter
of
the
soil
to
use
his
own
phrase
above
the
average
height
with
a
vigorous
constitution
and
plenty
of
common
sense
she
need
not
be
bookish
he
could
supply
all
that
accordingly
he
married
sarah
caffyn
his
mother
and
mrs
caffyn
had
been
early
friends
he
was
not
mistaken
in
sarah
she
was
certainly
robust
she
was
a
shrewd
housekeeper
and
she
never
read
anything
except
now
and
then
a
paragraph
or
two
in
the
weekly
newspaper
notwithstanding
for
there
were
no
children
time
hung
rather
heavily
on
her
hands
one
child
had
been
born
but
to
marshall
s
surprise
and
disappointment
it
was
a
poor
rickety
thing
and
died
before
it
was
a
twelvemonth
old
mrs
marshall
was
not
a
very
happy
woman
marshall
was
a
great
politician
and
spent
many
of
his
evenings
away
from
home
at
political
meetings
he
never
informed
her
what
he
had
been
doing
and
if
he
had
told
her
she
would
neither
have
understood
nor
cared
anything
about
it
at
great
oakhurst
she
heard
everything
and
took
an
interest
in
it
and
she
often
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
the
subject
which
occupied
marshall
s
thoughts
was
not
chartism
but
the
draining
of
that
heavy
bit
of
rough
pasture
that
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
village
he
was
very
good
and
kind
to
her
and
she
never
imagined
before
marriage
that
he
ought
to
be
more
she
was
sure
that
at
great
oakhurst
she
would
have
been
quite
comfortable
with
him
but
somehow
in
london
it
was
different
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
she
said
one
day
the
sort
of
husband
as
does
for
the
country
doesn
t
do
for
at
great
oakhurst
where
the
doors
were
always
open
into
the
yard
and
the
garden
where
every
house
was
merely
a
covered
bit
of
the
open
space
where
people
were
always
in
and
out
and
women
never
sat
down
except
to
their
meals
or
to
do
a
little
stitching
or
sewing
it
was
really
not
necessary
as
mrs
caffyn
observed
that
husband
and
wife
should
hit
it
so
mrs
marshall
hated
all
the
conveniences
of
london
she
abominated
particularly
the
taps
and
longed
to
be
obliged
in
all
weathers
to
go
out
to
the
well
and
wind
up
the
bucket
she
abominated
also
the
for
it
was
a
pleasure
to
be
at
least
she
thought
it
walk
down
to
the
and
throw
on
it
what
the
pig
could
not
eat
nay
she
even
missed
that
corner
of
the
garden
against
the
where
the
was
for
you
could
smell
the
there
in
the
and
the
wasn
t
as
bad
as
the
stuffy
back
room
in
great
ormond
street
when
three
or
four
men
were
in
she
did
all
she
could
to
spend
her
energy
on
her
cooking
and
cleaning
but
there
was
no
satisfaction
in
it
and
she
became
much
depressed
especially
after
the
child
died
this
was
the
main
reason
why
mrs
caffyn
determined
to
live
with
her
marshall
was
glad
she
resolved
to
come
his
wife
had
her
full
share
of
the
common
sense
he
desired
but
the
experiment
had
not
altogether
succeeded
he
knew
she
was
lonely
and
he
was
sorry
for
her
although
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
mend
matters
he
reflected
carefully
nothing
had
happened
which
was
a
surprise
to
him
the
relationship
was
what
he
had
supposed
it
would
be
excepting
that
the
child
did
not
live
and
its
mother
was
a
little
miserable
there
was
nothing
he
would
not
do
for
her
but
he
really
had
nothing
more
to
offer
her
although
mrs
marshall
had
made
up
her
mind
that
husbands
and
wives
could
not
be
as
contented
with
one
another
in
the
big
city
as
they
would
be
in
a
village
a
suspicion
crossed
her
mind
one
day
that
even
in
london
the
relationship
might
be
different
from
her
own
she
was
returning
from
great
oakhurst
after
a
visit
to
her
mother
she
had
stayed
there
for
about
a
month
after
her
child
s
death
and
she
travelled
back
to
town
with
a
letherhead
woman
who
had
married
a
journeyman
tanner
who
formerly
worked
in
the
letherhead
and
had
now
moved
to
bermondsey
a
horrid
hole
worse
than
great
ormond
street
both
marshall
and
the
tanner
were
at
the
swan
with
two
necks
to
meet
the
covered
van
and
the
tanner
s
wife
jumped
out
first
hullo
old
gal
here
you
are
cried
the
tanner
and
clasped
her
in
his
brown
arms
giving
her
nothing
loth
two
or
three
hearty
kisses
they
were
so
much
excited
at
meeting
one
another
that
they
forgot
their
friends
and
marched
off
without
bidding
them
mrs
marshall
was
welcomed
in
quieter
fashion
ah
she
thought
to
herself
red
tom
as
the
tanner
was
called
is
not
used
to
london
ways
they
are
perhaps
correct
for
london
but
marshall
might
now
and
then
remember
that
i
have
not
been
brought
up
to
to
return
however
to
the
hopgoods
before
the
afternoon
they
were
in
their
new
quarters
happily
for
them
for
mrs
hopgood
became
worse
on
the
morrow
she
was
seriously
ill
inflammation
of
the
lungs
appeared
and
in
a
week
she
was
dead
what
clara
and
madge
suffered
can
not
be
told
here
whenever
anybody
whom
we
love
dies
we
discover
that
although
death
is
commonplace
it
is
terribly
original
we
may
have
thought
about
it
all
our
lives
but
if
it
comes
close
to
us
it
is
quite
a
new
strange
thing
to
us
for
which
we
are
entirely
unprepared
it
may
perhaps
not
be
the
bare
loss
so
much
as
the
strength
of
the
bond
which
is
broken
that
is
the
surprise
and
we
are
debtors
in
a
way
to
death
for
revealing
something
in
us
which
ordinary
life
disguises
long
after
the
first
madness
of
their
grief
had
passed
clara
and
madge
were
astonished
to
find
how
dependent
they
had
been
on
their
mother
they
were
women
accustomed
to
act
for
themselves
but
they
felt
unsteady
and
as
if
deprived
of
customary
support
the
reference
to
her
had
been
constant
although
it
was
often
silent
and
they
were
not
conscious
of
it
a
defence
from
the
outside
waste
desert
had
been
broken
down
their
mother
had
always
seemed
to
intervene
between
them
and
the
world
and
now
they
were
exposed
and
shelterless
three
parts
of
mrs
hopgood
s
little
income
was
mainly
an
annuity
and
clara
and
madge
found
that
between
them
they
had
but
pounds
a
year
chapter
xv
frank
could
not
rest
he
wrote
again
to
clara
at
fenmarket
the
letter
went
to
mrs
cork
s
and
was
returned
to
him
he
saw
that
the
hopgoods
had
left
fenmarket
and
suspecting
the
reason
he
determined
at
any
cost
to
go
home
he
accordingly
alleged
a
pretext
not
altogether
fictitious
and
within
a
few
days
after
the
returned
letter
reached
him
he
was
back
at
stoke
newington
he
went
immediately
to
the
address
in
pentonville
which
he
found
on
the
envelope
but
was
very
shortly
informed
by
mrs
cork
that
she
knew
nothing
whatever
about
he
walked
round
myddelton
square
hopeless
for
he
had
no
clue
whatever
what
had
happened
to
him
would
scarcely
perhaps
have
caused
some
young
men
much
uneasiness
but
with
frank
the
case
was
altogether
different
there
was
a
chance
of
discovery
and
if
his
crime
should
come
to
light
his
whole
future
life
would
be
ruined
he
pictured
his
excommunication
his
father
s
agony
and
it
was
only
when
it
seemed
possible
that
the
water
might
close
over
the
ghastly
thing
thrown
in
it
and
no
ripple
reveal
what
lay
underneath
that
he
was
able
to
breathe
again
immediately
he
asked
himself
however
he
could
live
with
his
father
and
wear
a
mask
and
never
betray
his
dreadful
secret
so
he
wandered
homeward
in
the
most
miserable
of
all
conditions
he
was
paralysed
by
the
intricacy
of
the
coil
which
enveloped
and
grasped
him
that
evening
it
happened
that
there
was
a
musical
party
at
his
father
s
house
and
of
course
he
was
expected
to
assist
it
would
have
suited
his
mood
better
if
he
could
have
been
in
his
own
room
or
out
in
the
streets
but
absence
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
his
disguise
and
might
have
led
to
betrayal
consequently
he
was
present
and
the
gaiety
of
the
company
and
the
excitement
of
his
favourite
exercise
brought
about
for
a
time
forgetfulness
of
his
trouble
amongst
the
performers
was
a
distant
cousin
cecilia
morland
a
young
woman
rather
tall
and
fully
developed
not
strikingly
beautiful
but
with
a
lovely
tint
on
her
face
indicative
of
healthy
warm
rich
pulsations
she
possessed
a
contralto
voice
of
a
quality
like
that
of
a
blackbird
and
it
fell
to
her
and
to
frank
to
sing
she
was
dressed
in
a
fashion
perhaps
a
little
more
courtly
than
was
usual
in
the
gatherings
at
mr
palmer
s
house
and
frank
as
he
stood
beside
her
at
the
piano
could
not
restrain
his
eyes
from
straying
every
now
and
then
a
way
from
his
music
to
her
shoulders
and
once
nearly
lost
himself
during
a
solo
which
required
a
little
unusual
exertion
in
watching
the
movement
of
a
locket
and
of
what
was
for
a
moment
revealed
beneath
it
he
escorted
her
amidst
applause
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
the
two
sat
down
side
by
side
what
a
long
time
it
is
frank
since
you
and
i
sang
that
duet
together
we
have
seen
nothing
of
you
of
course
not
i
was
in
yes
but
i
think
you
deserted
us
before
then
do
you
remember
that
summer
when
we
were
all
together
at
bonchurch
and
the
part
songs
which
astonished
our
neighbours
just
as
it
was
growing
dark
i
recollect
you
and
i
tried
together
that
very
duet
for
the
first
time
with
the
old
frank
remembered
that
evening
well
you
sang
better
than
you
did
you
did
not
keep
time
what
were
you
dreaming
about
how
hot
the
room
is
do
you
not
feel
it
oppressive
let
us
go
into
the
conservatory
for
a
the
door
was
behind
them
and
they
slipped
in
and
sat
down
just
inside
and
under
the
orange
tree
you
must
not
be
away
so
long
again
now
mind
we
have
a
musical
evening
this
day
fortnight
you
will
come
promise
and
we
must
sing
that
duet
again
and
sing
it
he
did
not
reply
but
he
stooped
down
plucked
a
begonia
and
gave
it
to
her
that
is
a
pledge
it
is
very
good
of
she
tried
to
fasten
it
in
her
gown
underneath
the
locket
but
she
dropped
a
little
black
pin
he
went
down
on
his
knees
to
find
it
rose
and
put
the
flower
in
its
proper
place
himself
and
his
head
nearly
touched
her
neck
quite
unnecessarily
we
had
better
go
back
now
she
said
but
mind
i
shall
keep
this
flower
for
a
fortnight
and
a
day
and
if
you
make
any
excuses
i
shall
return
it
faded
and
yes
i
will
good
boy
no
apologies
like
those
you
sent
the
last
time
no
bad
throat
play
me
false
and
there
will
be
a
pretty
rebuke
for
dead
me
it
was
as
if
there
were
some
stoppage
in
a
main
artery
to
his
brain
me
it
rang
in
his
ears
and
for
a
moment
he
saw
nothing
but
the
scene
at
the
hall
with
miranda
fortunately
for
him
somebody
claimed
cecilia
and
he
slunk
back
into
the
greenhouse
one
of
mr
palmer
s
favourite
ballads
was
three
its
pathos
unfits
it
for
an
ordinary
but
as
the
music
at
mr
palmer
s
was
not
of
the
common
kind
three
was
put
on
the
list
for
that
night
was
dead
herself
ere
evensong
a
send
every
such
a
frank
knew
well
the
prayer
of
that
melody
and
as
he
listened
he
painted
to
himself
in
the
vividest
colours
madge
in
a
mean
room
in
a
mean
lodging
and
perhaps
dying
the
song
ceased
and
one
for
him
stood
next
he
heard
voices
calling
him
but
he
passed
out
into
the
garden
and
went
down
to
the
further
end
hiding
himself
behind
the
shrubs
presently
the
inquiry
for
him
ceased
and
he
was
relieved
by
hearing
an
instrumental
piece
begin
following
on
that
presentation
of
madge
came
for
his
unfaithfulness
he
scourged
himself
into
what
he
considered
to
be
his
duty
he
recalled
with
an
effort
all
madge
s
charms
mental
and
bodily
and
he
tried
to
break
his
heart
for
her
he
was
in
anguish
because
he
found
that
in
order
to
feel
as
he
ought
to
feel
some
effort
was
necessary
that
treason
to
her
was
possible
and
because
he
had
looked
with
such
eyes
upon
his
cousin
that
evening
he
saw
himself
as
something
separate
from
himself
and
although
he
knew
what
he
saw
to
be
flimsy
and
shallow
he
could
do
nothing
to
deepen
it
absolutely
nothing
it
was
not
the
betrayal
of
that
thunderstorm
which
now
tormented
him
he
could
have
represented
that
as
a
failure
to
be
surmounted
he
could
have
repented
it
it
was
his
own
inner
being
from
which
he
revolted
from
limitations
which
are
worse
than
crimes
for
who
by
taking
thought
can
add
one
cubit
to
his
stature
chapter
xvi
the
next
morning
found
frank
once
more
in
myddelton
square
he
looked
up
at
the
house
the
windows
were
all
shut
and
the
blinds
were
drawn
down
he
had
half
a
mind
to
call
again
but
mrs
cork
s
manner
had
been
so
offensive
and
repellent
that
he
desisted
presently
the
door
opened
and
maria
the
maid
came
out
to
clean
the
doorsteps
maria
as
we
have
already
said
was
a
little
more
human
than
her
mistress
and
having
overheard
the
conversation
between
her
and
frank
at
the
first
interview
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
frank
was
to
be
pitied
and
she
took
a
fancy
to
him
accordingly
when
he
passed
her
she
looked
up
and
said
frank
stopped
and
returned
her
greeting
you
was
here
the
other
day
sir
asking
where
them
hopgoods
had
yes
said
frank
eagerly
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
them
i
helped
the
cabman
with
the
boxes
and
i
heard
mrs
hopgood
say
great
ormond
street
but
i
have
forgotten
the
thank
you
very
frank
gave
the
astonished
and
grateful
maria
and
went
off
to
great
ormond
street
at
once
he
paced
up
and
down
the
street
half
a
dozen
times
hoping
he
might
recognise
in
a
window
some
ornament
from
fenmarket
or
perhaps
that
he
might
be
able
to
distinguish
a
piece
of
fenmarket
furniture
but
his
search
was
in
vain
for
the
two
girls
had
taken
furnished
rooms
at
the
back
of
the
house
his
quest
was
not
renewed
that
week
what
was
there
to
be
gained
by
going
over
the
ground
again
perhaps
they
might
have
found
the
lodgings
unsuitable
and
have
moved
elsewhere
at
church
on
sunday
he
met
his
cousin
cecilia
who
reminded
him
of
his
promise
see
she
said
here
is
the
begonia
i
put
it
in
my
in
order
to
preserve
it
when
i
could
keep
it
in
water
no
longer
and
it
has
stained
the
leaf
and
spoilt
the
athanasian
creed
you
will
have
it
sent
to
you
if
you
are
faithless
reflect
on
your
emotions
sir
when
you
receive
a
dead
flower
and
you
have
the
bitter
consciousness
also
that
you
have
damaged
my
creed
without
any
it
was
impossible
not
to
protest
that
he
had
no
thought
of
breaking
his
engagement
although
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
wished
once
or
twice
he
could
find
some
way
out
of
it
he
walked
with
her
down
the
churchyard
path
to
her
carriage
assisted
her
into
it
saluted
her
father
and
mother
and
then
went
home
with
his
own
people
the
evening
came
he
sang
with
cecilia
and
it
was
observed
and
he
himself
observed
it
how
completely
their
voices
harmonised
he
was
not
without
a
competitor
a
handsome
young
baritone
who
was
much
commended
when
he
came
to
the
end
of
his
performance
everybody
said
what
a
pity
it
was
that
the
following
duet
could
not
also
be
given
a
duet
which
cecilia
knew
perfectly
well
she
was
very
much
pressed
to
take
her
part
with
him
but
she
steadily
refused
on
the
ground
that
she
had
not
practised
it
that
she
had
already
sung
once
and
that
she
was
engaged
to
sing
once
more
with
her
cousin
frank
was
sitting
next
to
her
and
she
added
so
as
to
be
heard
by
him
alone
he
is
no
particular
favourite
of
there
was
no
direct
implication
that
frank
was
a
favourite
but
an
inference
was
possible
and
at
least
it
was
clear
that
she
preferred
to
reserve
herself
for
him
cecilia
s
gifts
her
fortune
and
her
gay
happy
face
had
made
many
a
young
fellow
restless
and
had
brought
several
proposals
none
of
which
had
been
accepted
all
this
frank
knew
and
how
could
he
repress
something
more
than
satisfaction
when
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
might
have
been
the
reason
why
nobody
as
yet
had
been
able
to
win
her
she
always
called
him
frank
for
although
they
were
not
first
cousins
they
were
cousins
he
generally
called
her
cecilia
but
she
was
cissy
in
her
own
house
he
was
hardly
close
enough
to
venture
upon
the
more
familiar
nickname
but
as
they
rose
to
go
to
the
piano
he
said
and
the
baritone
sat
next
to
her
now
once
she
looked
at
him
with
just
a
little
start
of
surprise
and
a
smile
spread
itself
over
her
face
after
they
had
finished
and
she
never
sang
better
the
baritone
noticed
that
she
seemed
indisposed
to
return
to
her
former
place
and
she
retired
with
frank
to
the
opposite
corner
of
the
room
i
wonder
she
said
if
being
happy
in
a
thing
is
a
sign
of
being
born
to
do
it
if
it
is
i
am
born
to
be
a
i
should
say
it
is
if
two
people
are
quite
happy
in
one
another
s
company
it
is
as
a
sign
they
were
born
for
one
yes
if
they
are
sure
they
are
happy
it
is
easier
for
me
to
be
sure
that
i
am
happier
with
a
thing
than
with
a
do
you
think
so
why
there
is
the
uncertainty
whether
the
person
is
happy
with
me
i
can
not
be
altogether
happy
with
anybody
unless
i
know
i
make
him
what
kind
of
person
is
he
with
whom
you
be
without
making
him
happy
the
baritone
rose
to
the
upper
f
with
a
clash
of
chords
on
the
piano
and
the
company
broke
up
frank
went
home
with
but
one
thought
in
his
thought
of
cecilia
his
bedroom
faced
the
its
windows
were
open
and
when
he
entered
the
wind
which
was
gradually
rising
struck
him
on
the
face
and
nearly
forced
the
door
out
of
his
hand
the
fire
in
his
blood
was
quenched
and
the
image
of
cecilia
receded
he
looked
out
and
saw
reflected
on
the
low
clouds
the
dull
glare
of
the
distant
city
just
over
there
was
great
ormond
street
and
underneath
that
dim
red
light
like
the
light
of
a
great
house
burning
was
madge
hopgood
he
lay
down
turning
over
from
side
to
side
in
the
vain
hope
that
by
change
of
position
he
might
sleep
after
about
an
hour
s
feverish
tossing
he
just
lost
himself
but
not
in
that
oblivion
which
slumber
usually
brought
him
he
was
so
far
awake
that
he
saw
what
was
around
him
and
yet
he
was
so
far
released
from
the
control
of
his
reason
that
he
did
not
recognise
what
he
saw
and
it
became
part
of
a
new
scene
created
by
his
delirium
the
full
moon
clearing
away
the
clouds
as
she
moved
upwards
had
now
passed
round
to
the
south
and
just
caught
the
white
farthest
from
him
he
his
eyes
his
mad
dream
still
clung
to
him
and
there
was
the
dead
madge
before
him
pale
in
death
and
holding
a
child
in
her
arms
he
distinctly
heard
himself
scream
as
he
started
up
in
affright
he
could
not
tell
where
he
was
the
spectre
faded
and
the
furniture
and
hangings
transformed
themselves
into
their
familiar
reality
he
could
not
lie
down
again
and
rose
and
dressed
himself
he
was
not
the
man
to
believe
that
the
ghost
could
be
a
revelation
or
a
prophecy
but
nevertheless
he
was
once
more
overcome
with
fear
a
vague
dread
partly
justifiable
by
the
fact
of
madge
by
the
fact
that
his
father
might
soon
know
what
had
happened
that
others
also
might
know
cecilia
for
example
but
partly
also
a
fear
going
beyond
all
the
facts
and
not
to
be
accounted
for
by
them
a
strange
horrible
trembling
such
as
men
feel
in
earthquakes
when
the
solid
rock
shakes
on
which
everything
rests
chapter
xvii
when
frank
came
downstairs
to
breakfast
the
conversation
turned
upon
his
return
to
germany
he
did
not
object
to
going
although
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
he
willed
to
go
he
was
in
that
perilous
condition
in
which
the
comparison
of
reasons
is
impossible
and
the
course
taken
depends
upon
some
chance
impulse
of
the
moment
and
is
a
mere
drift
he
could
not
leave
however
in
complete
ignorance
of
madge
and
with
no
certainty
as
to
her
future
he
resolved
therefore
to
make
one
more
effort
to
discover
the
house
that
was
all
which
he
determined
to
do
what
was
to
happen
when
he
had
found
it
he
did
not
know
he
was
driven
to
do
something
which
could
not
be
of
any
importance
save
for
what
must
follow
but
he
was
unable
to
bring
himself
even
to
consider
what
was
to
follow
he
knew
that
at
fenmarket
one
or
other
of
the
sisters
went
out
soon
after
breakfast
to
make
provision
for
the
day
and
perhaps
if
they
kept
up
this
custom
he
might
be
successful
in
his
search
he
accordingly
stationed
himself
in
great
ormond
street
at
about
nine
and
kept
watch
from
the
lamb
s
conduit
street
end
shifting
his
position
as
well
as
he
could
in
order
to
escape
notice
he
had
not
been
there
half
an
hour
when
he
saw
a
door
open
and
madge
came
out
and
went
westwards
she
turned
down
devonshire
street
as
if
on
her
way
to
holborn
he
instantly
ran
back
to
theobalds
road
and
when
he
came
to
the
corner
of
devonshire
street
she
was
about
ten
yards
from
him
and
he
faced
her
she
stopped
irresolutely
as
if
she
had
a
mind
to
return
but
as
he
approached
her
and
she
found
she
was
recognised
she
came
towards
him
madge
madge
he
cried
i
want
to
speak
to
you
i
must
speak
with
better
not
let
me
i
say
i
speak
to
we
can
not
talk
here
let
me
i
must
i
must
come
with
she
pitied
him
and
although
she
did
not
consent
she
did
not
refuse
he
called
a
cab
and
in
ten
minutes
not
a
word
having
been
spoken
during
those
ten
minutes
they
were
at
st
paul
s
the
morning
service
had
just
begun
and
they
sat
down
in
a
corner
far
away
from
the
worshippers
oh
madge
he
began
i
implore
you
to
take
me
back
i
love
you
i
do
love
you
can
not
leave
she
was
side
by
side
with
the
father
of
her
child
about
to
be
born
he
was
not
and
could
not
be
as
another
man
to
her
and
for
the
moment
there
was
the
danger
lest
she
should
mistake
this
secret
bond
for
love
the
thought
of
what
had
passed
between
them
and
of
the
child
his
and
hers
almost
overpowered
her
i
can
not
he
repeated
i
not
what
will
become
of
me
she
felt
herself
stronger
he
was
excited
but
his
excitement
was
not
contagious
the
string
vibrated
and
the
note
was
resonant
but
it
was
not
a
note
which
was
consonant
with
hers
and
it
did
not
stir
her
to
respond
he
might
love
her
he
was
sincere
enough
to
sacrifice
himself
for
her
and
to
remain
faithful
to
her
but
the
voice
was
not
altogether
that
of
his
own
true
self
partly
at
least
it
was
the
voice
of
what
he
considered
to
be
duty
of
superstition
and
alarm
she
was
silent
madge
he
continued
ought
you
to
refuse
you
have
some
love
for
me
is
it
not
greater
than
the
love
which
thousands
feel
for
one
another
will
you
blast
your
future
and
mine
and
perhaps
that
of
someone
besides
who
may
be
very
dear
to
you
you
not
i
say
to
listen
the
service
had
come
to
an
end
the
organist
was
playing
a
voluntary
rather
longer
than
usual
and
the
congregation
was
leaving
some
of
them
passing
near
madge
and
frank
and
casting
idle
glances
on
the
young
couple
who
had
evidently
come
neither
to
pray
nor
to
admire
the
architecture
madge
recognised
the
st
ann
s
fugue
and
strange
to
say
even
at
such
a
moment
it
took
entire
possession
of
her
the
golden
ladder
was
let
down
and
celestial
visitors
descended
when
the
music
ceased
she
spoke
it
would
be
a
a
crime
but
she
stopped
him
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
i
know
what
is
the
crime
to
the
world
but
it
would
have
been
a
crime
perhaps
a
worse
crime
if
a
ceremony
had
been
performed
beforehand
by
a
priest
and
the
worst
of
crimes
would
be
that
ceremony
now
i
must
she
rose
and
began
to
move
towards
the
door
he
walked
silently
by
her
side
till
they
were
in
st
paul
s
churchyard
when
she
took
him
by
the
hand
pressed
it
affectionately
and
suddenly
turned
into
one
of
the
courts
that
lead
towards
paternoster
row
he
did
not
follow
her
something
repelled
him
and
when
he
reached
home
it
crossed
his
mind
that
marriage
after
such
delay
would
be
a
poor
recompense
as
he
could
not
thereby
conceal
her
disgrace
chapter
xviii
it
was
clear
that
these
two
women
could
not
live
in
london
on
pounds
a
year
most
certainly
not
with
the
prospect
before
them
and
clara
cast
about
for
something
to
do
marshall
had
a
a
certain
baruch
cohen
a
mathematical
instrument
maker
in
clerkenwell
and
to
him
marshall
accidentally
one
day
talked
about
clara
and
said
that
she
desired
an
occupation
cohen
himself
could
not
give
clara
any
work
but
he
knew
a
bookseller
an
old
man
who
kept
a
shop
in
holborn
who
wanted
a
clerk
and
clara
thus
found
herself
earning
another
pound
a
week
with
this
addition
she
and
her
sister
could
manage
to
pay
their
way
and
provide
what
madge
would
want
the
hours
were
long
the
duties
irksome
and
wearisome
and
worst
of
all
the
conditions
under
which
they
were
performed
were
not
only
as
bad
as
they
could
be
but
their
badness
was
of
a
kind
to
which
clara
had
never
been
accustomed
so
that
she
felt
every
particle
of
it
in
its
full
force
the
windows
of
the
shop
were
of
course
full
of
books
and
the
walls
were
lined
with
them
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
also
was
a
range
of
shelves
and
books
were
stacked
on
the
floor
so
that
the
place
looked
like
a
huge
cubical
block
of
them
through
which
passages
had
been
bored
at
the
back
the
shop
became
contracted
in
width
to
about
eight
feet
and
consequently
the
central
shelves
were
not
continued
there
but
just
where
they
ended
and
overshadowed
by
them
were
a
little
desk
and
a
stool
all
round
the
desk
more
books
were
piled
and
some
manœuvring
was
necessary
in
order
to
sit
down
this
was
clara
s
station
occasionally
on
a
brilliant
a
very
brilliant
day
in
summer
she
could
write
without
gas
but
perhaps
there
were
not
a
dozen
such
days
in
the
year
by
twisting
herself
sideways
she
could
just
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
narrow
line
of
sky
over
some
heavy
theology
which
was
not
likely
to
be
disturbed
and
was
therefore
put
at
the
top
of
the
window
and
once
when
somebody
bought
the
was
very
clear
that
actually
descried
towards
seven
o
clock
a
blessed
star
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
gap
the
calvin
had
left
the
darkness
was
very
depressing
and
poor
clara
often
shut
her
eyes
as
she
bent
over
her
and
ledger
and
thought
of
the
fenmarket
flats
where
the
sun
could
be
seen
bisected
by
the
horizon
at
and
and
where
even
the
southern
antares
shone
with
diamond
glitter
close
to
the
ground
during
summer
nights
she
tried
to
reason
with
herself
during
the
dreadful
smoke
fogs
she
said
to
herself
that
they
were
only
thick
and
she
carried
herself
up
in
imagination
and
beheld
the
unclouded
azure
the
filthy
smother
lying
all
beneath
her
but
her
dream
did
not
continue
and
reality
was
too
strong
for
her
worse
perhaps
than
the
eternal
gloom
was
the
dirt
she
was
naturally
fastidious
and
as
her
skin
was
thin
and
sensitive
dust
was
physically
a
discomfort
even
at
fenmarket
she
was
continually
washing
her
hands
and
face
and
indeed
a
wash
was
more
necessary
to
her
after
a
walk
than
food
or
drink
it
was
impossible
to
remain
clean
in
holborn
for
five
minutes
everything
she
touched
was
foul
with
grime
her
collar
and
cuffs
were
black
with
it
when
she
went
home
to
her
dinner
and
it
was
not
like
the
honest
blowing
of
fenmarket
highways
but
a
loathsome
composition
of
everything
disgusting
which
could
be
produced
by
millions
of
human
beings
and
animals
packed
together
in
soot
it
was
a
real
misery
to
her
and
made
her
almost
ill
however
she
managed
to
set
up
for
herself
a
little
lavatory
in
the
basement
and
whenever
she
had
a
minute
at
her
command
she
descended
and
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
a
cool
dripping
sponge
and
a
piece
of
yellow
soap
the
smuts
began
to
gather
again
the
moment
she
went
upstairs
but
she
strove
to
arm
herself
with
a
little
philosophy
against
them
what
is
there
in
life
she
moralised
smiling
at
her
sermonising
which
once
won
is
for
ever
won
it
is
always
being
won
and
always
being
her
master
fortunately
was
one
of
the
kindest
of
men
an
old
gentleman
of
about
who
wore
a
white
necktie
clean
every
morning
he
was
really
a
in
the
true
sense
of
that
much
misused
word
and
not
a
mere
that
is
to
say
he
loved
his
business
not
altogether
for
the
money
it
brought
him
but
as
an
art
he
was
known
far
and
wide
and
literary
people
were
glad
to
gossip
with
him
he
never
pushed
his
wares
and
he
hated
to
sell
them
to
anybody
who
did
not
know
their
value
he
amused
clara
one
afternoon
when
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
and
a
lady
inquired
if
he
had
a
manning
and
bray
s
of
yes
he
had
a
copy
and
he
pointed
to
the
three
handsome
tall
folios
what
is
the
price
twelve
pounds
i
think
i
will
have
madam
you
will
pardon
me
but
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
i
think
something
much
cheaper
will
suit
you
better
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
look
out
for
you
and
will
report
in
a
few
oh
very
well
and
she
departed
the
wife
of
a
brassfounder
he
said
to
clara
made
a
lot
of
money
and
now
he
has
bought
a
house
at
dulwich
and
is
setting
up
a
library
somebody
has
told
him
that
he
ought
to
have
a
county
history
and
that
manning
and
bray
is
the
book
manning
and
bray
what
he
wants
is
a
dulwich
and
denmark
hill
directory
no
no
and
he
took
down
one
of
the
big
volumes
blew
the
dust
off
the
top
edges
and
looked
at
the
old
inside
you
won
t
go
there
if
i
can
help
he
took
a
fancy
to
clara
when
he
found
she
loved
literature
although
what
she
read
was
out
of
his
department
altogether
and
his
perfectly
human
behaviour
to
her
prevented
that
sense
of
exile
and
loneliness
which
is
so
horrible
to
many
a
poor
creature
who
comes
up
to
london
to
begin
therein
the
struggle
for
existence
she
read
and
meditated
a
good
deal
in
the
shop
but
not
to
much
profit
for
she
was
continually
interrupted
and
the
thought
of
her
sister
intruded
itself
perpetually
madge
seldom
or
never
spoke
of
her
separation
from
frank
but
one
night
when
she
was
somewhat
less
reserved
than
usual
clara
ventured
to
ask
her
if
she
had
heard
from
him
since
they
parted
i
met
him
madge
do
you
mean
that
he
found
out
where
we
are
living
and
that
he
came
to
see
you
no
it
was
just
round
the
corner
as
i
was
going
towards
nothing
could
have
brought
him
here
but
yourself
said
clara
slowly
clara
you
doubt
no
no
i
doubt
you
never
but
you
hesitate
you
reflect
speak
god
forbid
i
should
utter
a
word
which
would
induce
you
to
disbelieve
what
you
know
to
be
right
it
is
much
more
important
to
believe
earnestly
that
something
is
morally
right
than
that
it
should
be
really
right
and
he
who
attempts
to
displace
a
belief
runs
a
certain
risk
because
he
is
not
sure
that
what
he
substitutes
can
be
held
with
equal
force
besides
each
person
s
belief
or
proposed
course
of
action
is
a
part
of
himself
and
if
he
be
diverted
from
it
and
takes
up
with
that
which
is
not
himself
the
unity
of
his
nature
is
impaired
and
he
loses
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
prophet
is
to
break
no
you
know
i
do
not
mean
that
and
you
know
too
how
incapable
i
am
of
defending
myself
in
argument
i
never
can
stand
up
for
anything
i
say
i
can
now
and
then
say
something
but
when
i
have
said
it
i
run
my
dearest
clara
madge
put
her
arm
over
her
sister
s
shoulder
as
they
sat
side
by
side
do
not
run
away
now
tell
me
just
what
you
think
of
clara
was
silent
for
a
minute
i
have
sometimes
wondered
whether
you
have
not
demanded
a
little
too
much
of
yourself
and
frank
it
is
always
a
question
of
how
much
there
is
no
human
truth
which
is
altogether
true
no
love
which
is
altogether
perfect
you
may
possibly
have
neglected
virtue
or
devotion
such
as
you
could
not
find
elsewhere
overlooking
it
because
some
failing
or
the
lack
of
sympathy
on
some
unimportant
point
may
at
the
moment
have
been
prominent
frank
loved
you
madge
did
not
reply
she
withdrew
her
arm
from
her
sister
s
neck
threw
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
she
saw
again
the
fenmarket
roads
that
summer
evening
and
she
felt
once
more
frank
s
burning
caresses
she
thought
of
him
as
he
left
st
paul
s
perhaps
stronger
than
every
other
motive
to
return
to
him
and
stronger
than
ever
was
the
movement
towards
him
of
that
which
belonged
to
him
at
last
she
cried
out
literally
cried
with
a
vehemence
which
startled
and
terrified
clara
clara
clara
you
know
not
what
you
do
for
god
s
sake
forbear
she
was
again
silent
and
then
she
turned
round
hurriedly
hid
her
face
and
sobbed
piteously
it
lasted
however
but
for
a
minute
she
rose
wiped
her
eyes
went
to
the
window
came
back
again
and
said
it
is
beginning
to
the
iron
pillar

to

quivered
and
resounded
under
the

but
its

were
nothing
more
than
those

unshaken

for
an
instant
the

not

chapter
xix
mr
cohen
who
had
obtained
the
situation
indirectly
for
clara
thought
nothing
more
about
it
until
one
day
he
went
to
the
shop
and
he
then
recollected
his
recommendation
which
had
been
given
solely
in
faith
for
he
had
never
seen
the
young
woman
and
had
trusted
entirely
to
marshall
he
found
her
at
her
dark
desk
and
as
he
approached
her
she
hastily
put
a
mark
in
a
book
and
closed
it
have
you
sold
a
little
volume
called
office
by
a
man
named
robinson
i
did
not
know
we
had
it
i
have
never
seen
i
do
not
wonder
but
i
saw
it
here
about
six
months
ago
it
was
up
there
pointing
to
a
top
shelf
clara
was
about
to
mount
the
ladder
but
he
stopped
her
and
found
what
he
wanted
some
of
the
leaves
were
torn
we
can
repair
those
for
you
in
about
a
couple
of
days
it
shall
be
he
lingered
a
little
and
at
that
moment
another
customer
entered
clara
went
forward
to
speak
to
him
and
cohen
was
able
to
see
that
it
was
the
and
hero
she
had
been
studying
a
course
of
lectures
which
had
been
given
by
a
mr
carlyle
of
whom
cohen
knew
something
as
the
customer
showed
no
signs
of
departing
cohen
left
saying
he
would
call
again
before
sending
robinson
s
office
to
the
binder
clara
looked
at
it
it
was
made
up
of
short
essays
about
twenty
altogether
bound
in
cloth
lettered
at
the
side
and
published
in
they
were
upon
the
oddest
subjects
such
as
children
to
learn
rules
before
higher
mathematics
and
we
to
tell
those
whom
we
love
what
we
think
about
reasoning
in
troubles
ought
we
to
make
known
and
what
ought
we
to
keep
as
a
science
and
an
clara
did
not
read
any
one
essay
through
she
had
no
time
but
she
was
somewhat
struck
with
a
few
sentences
which
caught
her
eye
for
a
mere
dream
a
vague
hope
ought
in
some
cases
to
be
more
potent
than
a
certainty
in
regulating
our
action
the
faintest
vision
of
god
should
be
more
determinative
than
the
grossest
earthly
i
knew
a
case
in
which
a
man
had
to
encounter
three
successive
trials
of
all
the
courage
and
inventive
faculty
in
him
failure
in
one
would
have
been
ruin
the
odds
against
him
in
each
trial
were
desperate
and
against
ultimate
victory
were
overwhelming
nevertheless
he
made
the
attempt
and
was
triumphant
by
the
narrowest
margin
in
every
struggle
that
which
is
of
most
value
to
us
is
often
obtained
in
defiance
of
the
laws
of
what
is
precious
in
quakerism
is
not
so
much
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
voice
as
that
of
the
preliminary
stillness
the
closure
against
other
voices
and
the
reduction
of
the
mind
to
a
condition
in
which
it
can
in
which
it
can
discern
the
merest
whisper
inaudible
when
the
world
or
interest
or
passion
are
permitted
to
the
acutest
syllogiser
can
never
develop
the
actual
consequences
of
any
system
of
policy
or
indeed
of
any
change
in
human
relationship
man
being
so
infinitely
complex
and
the
interaction
of
human
forces
so
many
of
our
speculative
difficulties
arise
from
the
unauthorised
conception
of
an
god
a
conception
entirely
of
our
own
creation
and
one
which
if
we
look
at
it
closely
has
no
meaning
it
is
because
god
have
done
otherwise
and
did
not
that
we
are
confounded
it
may
be
distressing
to
think
that
god
can
not
do
any
better
but
it
is
not
so
distressing
as
to
believe
that
he
might
have
done
better
had
he
so
although
these
passages
were
disconnected
each
of
them
seemed
to
clara
to
be
written
in
a
measure
for
herself
and
her
curiosity
was
excited
about
the
author
perhaps
the
man
who
called
would
say
something
about
him
baruch
cohen
was
now
a
little
over
forty
he
was
half
a
jew
for
his
father
was
a
jew
and
his
mother
a
gentile
the
father
had
broken
with
judaism
but
had
not
been
converted
to
any
christian
church
or
sect
he
was
a
originally
from
holland
came
over
to
england
and
married
the
daughter
of
a
mathematical
instrument
maker
at
whose
house
he
lodged
in
clerkenwell
the
son
was
apprenticed
to
his
maternal
grandfather
s
trade
became
very
skilful
at
it
worked
at
it
himself
employed
a
man
and
a
boy
and
supplied
london
shops
which
sold
his
instruments
at
about
three
times
the
price
he
obtained
for
them
baruch
when
he
was
very
young
married
marshall
s
elder
sister
but
she
died
at
the
birth
of
her
first
child
and
he
had
been
a
widower
now
for
nineteen
years
he
had
often
thought
of
taking
another
wife
and
had
seen
during
these
nineteen
years
two
or
three
women
with
whom
he
had
imagined
himself
to
be
really
in
love
and
to
whom
he
had
been
on
the
verge
of
making
proposals
but
in
each
case
he
had
hung
back
and
when
he
found
that
a
second
and
a
third
had
awakened
the
same
ardour
for
a
time
as
the
first
he
distrusted
its
genuineness
he
was
now
too
at
a
time
of
life
when
a
man
has
to
make
the
unpleasant
discovery
that
he
is
beginning
to
lose
the
right
to
expect
what
he
still
eagerly
desires
and
that
he
must
beware
of
being
ridiculous
it
is
indeed
a
very
unpleasant
discovery
if
he
has
done
anything
well
which
was
worth
doing
or
has
made
himself
a
name
he
may
be
treated
by
women
with
respect
or
adulation
but
any
passable
boy
of
twenty
is
really
more
interesting
to
them
and
unhappily
there
is
perhaps
so
much
of
the
man
left
in
him
that
he
would
rather
see
the
eyes
of
a
girl
melt
when
she
looked
at
him
than
be
adored
by
all
the
in
london
as
the
author
of
the
greatest
poem
since
or
as
the
conqueror
of
half
a
continent
baruch
s
life
during
the
last
nineteen
years
had
been
such
that
he
was
still
young
and
he
desired
more
than
ever
because
not
so
blindly
as
he
desired
it
when
he
was
a
youth
the
tender
intimate
sympathy
of
a
woman
s
love
it
was
singular
that
during
all
those
nineteen
years
he
should
not
once
have
been
overcome
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
been
held
back
not
by
himself
but
by
some
external
power
which
refused
to
give
any
reasons
for
so
doing
there
was
now
less
chance
of
yielding
than
ever
he
was
reserved
and
and
his
manner
towards
women
distinctly
announced
to
them
that
he
knew
what
he
was
and
that
he
had
no
claims
whatever
upon
them
he
was
something
of
a
philosopher
too
he
accepted
therefore
as
well
as
he
could
without
complaint
the
inevitable
order
of
nature
and
he
tried
to
acquire
although
often
he
failed
that
blessed
art
of
taking
up
lightly
and
even
with
a
smile
whatever
he
was
compelled
to
handle
it
is
possible
he
said
once
to
consider
death
too
he
was
naturally
more
than
half
a
jew
his
features
were
jewish
his
thinking
was
jewish
and
he
believed
after
a
fashion
in
the
jewish
sacred
books
or
at
anyrate
read
them
continuously
although
he
had
added
to
his
armoury
defensive
weapons
of
another
type
in
nothing
was
he
more
jewish
than
in
a
tendency
to
dwell
upon
the
one
or
what
he
called
god
clinging
still
to
the
expression
of
his
forefathers
although
departing
so
widely
from
them
in
his
ethics
and
system
of
life
as
well
as
in
his
religion
there
was
the
same
intolerance
of
a
multiplicity
which
was
not
reducible
to
unity
he
seldom
explained
his
theory
but
everybody
who
knew
him
recognised
the
difference
which
it
wrought
between
him
and
other
men
there
was
a
certain
concord
in
everything
he
said
and
did
as
if
it
were
directed
by
some
enthroned
but
secret
principle
he
had
encountered
no
particular
trouble
since
his
wife
s
death
but
his
life
had
been
unhappy
he
had
no
friends
much
as
he
longed
for
friendship
and
he
could
not
give
any
reasons
for
his
failure
he
saw
other
persons
more
successful
but
he
remained
solitary
their
needs
were
not
so
great
as
his
for
it
is
not
those
who
have
the
least
but
those
who
have
the
most
to
give
who
most
want
sympathy
he
had
often
made
advances
people
had
called
on
him
and
had
appeared
interested
in
him
but
they
had
dropped
away
the
cause
was
chiefly
to
be
found
in
his
nationality
the
ordinary
englishman
disliked
him
simply
as
a
jew
and
the
better
sort
were
repelled
by
a
lack
of
geniality
and
by
his
inability
to
manifest
a
healthy
interest
in
personal
details
partly
also
the
cause
was
that
those
who
care
to
speak
about
what
is
nearest
to
them
are
very
rare
and
most
persons
find
conversation
easy
in
proportion
to
the
remoteness
of
its
topics
from
them
whatever
the
reasons
may
have
been
baruch
now
no
matter
what
the
pressure
from
within
might
be
generally
kept
himself
to
himself
it
was
a
mistake
and
he
ought
not
to
have
retreated
so
far
upon
repulse
a
word
will
sometimes
when
least
expected
unlock
a
heart
a
soul
is
gained
for
ever
and
at
once
there
is
much
more
than
a
recompense
for
the
indifference
of
years
after
the
death
of
his
wife
baruch
s
affection
spent
itself
upon
his
son
benjamin
whom
he
had
apprenticed
to
a
firm
of
optical
instrument
makers
in
york
the
boy
was
not
very
much
like
his
father
he
was
indifferent
to
that
religion
by
which
his
father
lived
but
he
inherited
an
aptitude
for
mathematics
which
was
very
necessary
in
his
trade
benjamin
also
possessed
his
father
s
rectitude
trusted
him
and
looked
to
him
for
advice
to
such
a
degree
that
even
baruch
at
last
thought
it
would
be
better
to
send
him
away
from
home
in
order
that
he
might
become
a
little
more
and
independent
it
was
the
sorest
of
trials
to
part
with
him
and
for
some
time
after
he
left
baruch
s
loneliness
was
intolerable
it
was
however
relieved
by
a
visit
to
york
perhaps
once
in
four
or
five
months
for
whenever
business
could
be
alleged
as
an
excuse
for
going
north
he
managed
as
he
said
to
take
york
on
his
the
day
after
he
met
clara
he
started
for
birmingham
and
although
york
was
certainly
not
on
his
way
he
pushed
forward
to
the
city
and
reached
it
on
a
saturday
evening
he
was
to
spend
sunday
there
and
on
sunday
morning
he
proposed
that
they
should
hear
the
cathedral
service
and
go
for
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
to
this
suggestion
benjamin
partially
assented
he
wished
to
go
to
the
cathedral
in
the
morning
but
thought
his
father
had
better
rest
after
dinner
baruch
somewhat
resented
the
insinuation
of
possible
fatigue
consequent
on
advancing
years
what
do
you
mean
he
said
you
know
well
enough
i
enjoy
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
besides
i
shall
not
see
much
of
you
and
do
not
want
to
lose
what
little
time
i
about
three
therefore
they
started
and
presently
a
girl
met
them
who
was
introduced
simply
as
miss
we
are
going
to
your
side
of
the
water
said
the
son
you
may
as
well
cross
with
they
came
to
a
point
where
a
boat
was
moored
and
a
man
was
in
it
there
was
no
regular
ferry
but
on
sundays
he
earned
a
trifle
by
taking
people
to
the
opposite
meadow
and
thus
enabling
them
to
vary
their
return
journey
to
the
city
when
they
were
about
of
the
way
over
benjamin
observed
that
if
they
stood
up
they
could
see
the
minster
they
all
three
rose
and
without
an
instant
s
could
not
tell
afterwards
how
it
boat
half
capsized
and
they
were
in
eight
or
nine
feet
of
water
baruch
could
not
swim
and
went
down
at
once
but
on
coming
up
close
to
the
gunwale
he
caught
at
it
and
held
fast
looking
round
he
saw
that
benjamin
who
could
swim
well
had
made
for
miss
masters
and
having
caught
her
by
the
back
of
the
neck
was
taking
her
ashore
the
boatman
who
could
also
swim
called
out
to
baruch
to
hold
on
gave
the
boat
three
or
four
vigorous
strokes
from
the
stern
and
baruch
felt
the
ground
under
his
feet
the
boatman
s
little
cottage
was
not
far
off
and
when
the
party
reached
it
benjamin
earnestly
desired
miss
masters
to
take
off
her
wet
clothes
and
occupy
the
bed
which
was
offered
her
he
himself
would
run
was
not
after
having
changed
would
go
to
her
house
and
send
her
sister
with
what
was
wanted
he
was
just
off
when
it
suddenly
struck
him
that
his
father
might
need
some
attention
oh
he
began
but
the
boatman
s
wife
interposed
he
can
t
be
left
like
that
and
he
can
t
go
home
he
ll
catch
his
death
o
cold
and
there
isn
t
but
one
more
bed
in
the
house
and
that
isn
t
quite
fit
to
put
a
gentleman
in
howsomever
he
must
turn
in
there
and
my
husband
he
can
go
into
the
and
rub
himself
down
you
won
t
do
yourself
no
good
mr
cohen
addressing
the
son
whom
she
knew
by
going
back
you
d
better
stay
here
and
get
into
bed
with
your
in
a
few
minutes
the
boatman
would
have
gone
on
the
errand
but
benjamin
could
not
lose
the
opportunity
of
sacrificing
himself
for
miss
masters
he
rushed
off
and
in
of
an
hour
had
returned
with
the
sister
having
learned
after
anxious
inquiry
that
miss
masters
so
far
as
could
be
discovered
had
not
caught
a
chill
he
went
to
his
father
well
father
i
hope
you
are
none
the
worse
for
the
ducking
he
said
gaily
the
next
time
you
come
to
york
you
d
better
bring
another
suit
of
clothes
with
baruch
turned
round
uneasily
and
did
not
answer
immediately
he
had
had
a
narrow
escape
from
drowning
nothing
of
much
consequence
is
your
friend
all
right
oh
yes
i
was
anxious
about
her
for
she
is
not
very
strong
but
i
do
not
think
she
will
come
to
much
harm
i
made
them
light
a
fire
in
her
are
they
drying
my
clothes
i
ll
go
and
he
went
away
and
encountered
the
elder
miss
masters
who
told
him
that
her
sister
feeling
no
ill
effects
from
the
plunge
had
determined
to
go
home
at
once
and
in
fact
was
nearly
ready
benjamin
waited
and
presently
she
came
downstairs
smiling
nothing
the
matter
i
owe
it
to
you
however
that
i
am
not
now
in
another
benjamin
was
in
an
ecstasy
and
considered
himself
bound
to
accompany
her
to
her
door
meanwhile
baruch
lay
upstairs
alone
in
no
very
happy
temper
he
heard
the
conversation
below
and
knew
that
his
son
had
gone
in
all
genuine
love
there
is
something
of
ferocious
selfishness
the
perfectly
divine
nature
knows
how
to
keep
it
in
check
and
is
even
it
to
be
a
woman
s
contentment
if
the
loved
one
is
happy
no
matter
with
what
or
with
whom
but
the
nature
only
a
little
less
than
divine
can
not
without
pain
endure
the
thought
that
it
no
longer
owns
privately
and
exclusively
that
which
it
loves
even
when
it
loves
a
child
and
baruch
was
particularly
excusable
considering
his
solitude
nevertheless
he
had
learned
a
little
wisdom
and
what
was
of
much
greater
importance
had
learned
how
to
use
it
when
he
needed
it
it
had
been
forced
upon
him
it
was
an
adjustment
to
circumstances
the
wisest
wisdom
it
was
not
something
without
any
particular
connection
with
him
it
was
rather
the
external
protection
built
up
from
within
to
shield
him
where
he
was
vulnerable
it
was
the
answer
to
questions
which
had
been
put
to
and
not
to
those
which
had
been
put
to
other
people
so
it
came
to
pass
that
when
he
said
bitterly
to
himself
that
if
he
were
at
that
moment
lying
dead
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
benjamin
would
have
found
consolation
very
near
at
hand
he
was
able
to
reflect
upon
the
folly
of
and
to
rebuke
himself
for
a
complaint
against
what
was
simply
the
order
of
nature
and
not
a
personal
failure
his
however
was
not
very
permanent
when
he
left
york
the
next
morning
he
fancied
his
son
was
not
particularly
grieved
and
he
was
passive
under
the
thought
that
an
epoch
in
his
life
had
come
that
the
milestones
now
began
to
show
the
distance
to
the
place
to
which
he
travelled
and
still
worse
that
the
boy
who
had
been
so
close
to
him
and
upon
whom
he
had
so
much
depended
had
gone
from
him
there
is
no
remedy
for
our
troubles
which
is
uniformly
and
progressively
efficacious
all
that
we
have
a
right
to
expect
from
our
religion
is
that
gradually
very
gradually
it
will
assist
us
to
a
real
victory
after
each
apparent
defeat
if
we
are
bravely
in
earnest
we
gain
something
on
our
former
position
baruch
was
two
days
on
his
journey
back
to
town
and
as
he
came
nearer
home
he
recovered
himself
a
little
suddenly
he
remembered
the
bookshop
and
the
book
for
which
he
had
to
call
and
that
he
had
intended
to
ask
marshall
something
about
the
bookseller
s
new
assistant
chapter
xx
madge
was
a
puzzle
to
mrs
caffyn
mrs
caffyn
loved
her
and
when
she
was
ill
had
behaved
like
a
mother
to
her
the
child
a
healthy
girl
was
treated
by
mrs
caffyn
as
if
it
were
her
own
granddaughter
and
many
little
luxuries
were
bought
which
never
appeared
in
mrs
marshall
s
weekly
bill
naturally
mrs
caffyn
s
affection
moved
a
response
from
madge
and
mrs
caffyn
by
degrees
heard
the
greater
part
of
her
history
but
why
she
had
separated
herself
from
her
lover
without
any
apparent
reason
remained
a
mystery
and
all
the
greater
was
the
mystery
because
mrs
caffyn
believed
that
there
were
no
other
facts
to
be
known
than
those
she
knew
she
longed
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
it
was
dreadful
to
her
that
madge
should
be
condemned
to
poverty
and
that
her
infant
should
be
fatherless
although
there
was
a
gentleman
waiting
to
take
them
both
and
make
them
happy
the
hair
won
t
be
dark
like
yours
my
love
she
said
one
afternoon
soon
after
madge
had
come
downstairs
and
was
lying
on
the
sofa
the
hair
do
darken
a
lot
but
hers
will
never
be
black
it
s
my
opinion
as
it
ll
be
madge
did
not
speak
and
mrs
caffyn
who
was
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
couch
put
her
work
and
her
spectacles
on
the
table
it
was
growing
dusk
she
took
madge
s
hand
which
hung
down
by
her
side
and
gently
lifted
it
up
such
a
delicate
hand
mrs
caffyn
thought
she
was
proud
that
she
had
for
a
friend
the
owner
of
such
a
hand
who
behaved
to
her
as
an
equal
it
was
delightful
to
be
mere
formal
a
lady
fit
to
go
into
the
finest
in
london
but
it
was
a
greater
delight
that
madge
s
talk
suited
her
better
than
any
she
had
heard
at
great
oakhurst
it
was
natural
she
should
rejoice
when
she
discovered
unconsciously
that
she
had
a
soul
to
which
the
speech
of
the
stars
though
somewhat
strange
was
not
an
utterly
foreign
tongue
she
retained
her
hold
on
madge
s
hand
may
be
she
continued
it
ll
be
like
its
father
s
in
our
family
all
the
gals
take
after
the
father
and
all
the
boys
after
the
mother
i
suppose
as
has
lightish
hair
still
madge
said
nothing
it
isn
t
easy
to
believe
as
the
father
of
that
blessed
dear
could
have
been
a
bad
lot
i
m
sure
he
isn
t
and
yet
there
s
that
polesden
gal
at
the
farm
she
as
went
wrong
with
jim
a
great
ugly
brute
and
she
herself
warnt
up
to
much
well
as
i
say
her
child
was
the
delicatest
little
angel
as
i
ever
saw
it
s
my
belief
as
mixes
hisself
up
in
it
more
nor
we
think
but
there
nothing
amiss
with
him
was
there
my
sweet
mrs
caffyn
inclined
her
head
towards
madge
oh
no
nothing
don
t
you
think
my
dear
if
there
s
nothing
atwixt
you
as
it
was
a
flyin
in
the
face
of
providence
to
turn
him
off
you
were
reglarly
engaged
to
him
and
i
have
heard
you
say
he
was
very
fond
of
you
i
suppose
there
were
some
high
words
about
something
and
a
kind
of
a
quarrel
like
and
so
you
parted
but
that
s
nothing
it
might
all
be
made
up
now
and
it
ought
to
be
made
up
what
was
it
about
there
was
no
well
of
course
if
you
don
t
like
to
say
anything
more
to
me
i
won
t
ask
you
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
secrets
as
i
shouldn
t
hear
i
speak
only
because
i
can
t
abear
to
see
you
here
when
i
believe
as
everything
might
be
put
right
and
you
might
have
a
house
of
your
own
and
a
good
husband
and
be
happy
for
the
rest
of
your
days
it
isn
t
too
late
for
that
now
i
know
what
i
know
and
as
how
he
d
marry
you
at
oh
my
dear
mrs
caffyn
i
have
no
secret
from
you
who
have
been
so
good
to
me
i
can
only
say
i
could
not
love
as
i
if
you
can
t
love
a
man
that
s
to
say
if
you
can
t
him
it
s
wrong
to
have
him
but
if
there
s
a
child
that
does
make
a
difference
for
one
has
to
think
of
the
child
and
of
being
respectable
there
s
something
in
being
respectable
although
for
that
matter
i
ve
see
d
respectable
people
at
great
oakhurst
as
were
ten
times
worse
than
those
as
aren
t
still
for
myself
i
d
put
up
with
a
goodish
bit
to
marry
the
man
whose
child
wor
for
myself
i
could
but
it
wouldn
t
be
just
to
i
don
t
see
what
you
i
mean
that
i
could
sacrifice
myself
if
i
believed
it
to
be
my
duty
but
i
should
wrong
him
cruelly
if
i
were
to
accept
him
and
did
not
love
him
with
all
my
my
dear
you
take
my
word
for
it
he
isn
t
so
particklar
as
you
are
a
man
isn
t
so
particklar
as
a
woman
he
goes
about
his
work
and
has
all
sorts
of
things
in
his
head
and
if
a
woman
makes
him
comfortable
when
he
comes
home
he
s
all
right
i
won
t
say
as
one
woman
is
much
the
same
as
another
to
a
to
all
still
they
are
particklar
maybe
though
it
isn
t
quite
the
same
with
gentlefolk
like
yourself
there
s
that
blessed
baby
mrs
caffyn
hastened
upstairs
leaving
madge
to
her
reflections
once
more
the
old
dialectic
reappeared
after
all
she
thought
it
is
as
clara
said
a
question
of
degree
there
are
not
a
thousand
husbands
and
wives
in
this
great
city
whose
relationship
comes
near
perfection
if
i
felt
aversion
my
course
would
be
clear
but
there
is
no
aversion
on
the
contrary
our
affection
for
one
another
is
sufficient
for
a
decent
household
and
decent
existence
undisturbed
by
catastrophes
no
brighter
sunlight
is
obtained
by
others
far
better
than
myself
ought
i
to
expect
a
refinement
of
relationship
to
which
i
have
no
right
our
claims
are
always
beyond
our
deserts
and
we
are
disappointed
if
our
poor
mean
defective
natures
do
not
obtain
the
homage
which
belongs
to
those
of
ethereal
texture
it
will
be
a
life
with
no
enthusiasms
nor
romance
perhaps
but
it
will
be
tolerable
and
what
may
be
called
happy
and
my
child
will
be
protected
and
educated
my
child
what
is
there
which
i
ought
to
put
in
the
balance
against
her
if
our
sympathy
is
not
complete
i
have
my
own
little
oratory
i
can
keep
the
candles
alight
close
the
door
and
worship
there
so
she
mused
and
her
foes
again
ranged
themselves
over
against
her
there
was
nothing
to
support
her
but
something
veiled
which
would
not
altogether
disclose
or
explain
itself
nevertheless
in
a
few
minutes
her
enemies
had
vanished
like
a
mist
before
a
sudden
wind
and
she
was
once
more
victorious
precious
and
rare
are
those
divine
souls
to
whom
that
which
is
aërial
is
substantial
the
only
true
substance
those
for
whom
a
pale
vision
possesses
an
authority
they
are
forced
unconditionally
to
obey
chapter
xxi
mrs
caffyn
was
unhappy
and
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
talk
to
frank
herself
she
had
learned
enough
about
him
from
the
two
sisters
especially
from
clara
to
make
her
believe
that
with
a
very
little
management
she
could
bring
him
back
to
madge
the
difficulty
was
to
see
him
without
his
father
s
knowledge
at
last
she
determined
to
write
to
him
and
she
made
her
address
the
envelope
and
mark
it
private
this
is
what
she
said
dear
sir
unbeknown
to
you
i
take
the
liberty
of
telling
you
as
is
alivin
here
with
me
and
somebody
else
as
i
think
you
ought
to
see
but
perhaps
i
d
better
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
myself
if
not
quite
to
you
and
maybe
you
ll
be
kind
enough
to
say
how
that
s
to
be
done
to
your
obedient
humble
servant
mrs
she
thought
this
very
diplomatic
inasmuch
as
nobody
but
frank
could
possibly
suspect
what
the
letter
meant
it
went
to
stoke
newington
but
alas
he
was
in
germany
and
poor
mrs
caffyn
had
to
wait
a
week
before
she
received
a
reply
frank
of
course
understood
it
although
he
had
thought
about
madge
continually
he
had
become
calmer
he
saw
it
is
true
that
there
was
no
stability
in
his
position
and
that
he
could
not
possibly
remain
where
he
was
had
madge
been
the
commonest
of
the
common
and
his
relationship
to
her
the
commonest
of
the
common
he
could
not
permit
her
to
cast
herself
loose
from
him
for
ever
and
take
upon
herself
the
whole
burden
of
his
misdeed
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
as
successive
considerations
and
reconsiderations
ended
in
nothing
and
the
distractions
of
a
foreign
country
were
so
numerous
madge
had
for
a
time
been
put
aside
like
a
huge
bill
which
we
can
not
pay
and
which
staggers
us
we
therefore
docket
it
and
hide
it
in
the
desk
and
we
imagine
we
have
done
something
once
again
however
the
flame
leapt
up
out
of
the
ashes
vivid
as
ever
once
again
the
thought
that
he
had
been
so
close
to
madge
and
that
she
had
yielded
to
him
touched
him
with
peculiar
tenderness
and
it
seemed
impossible
to
part
himself
from
her
to
a
man
with
any
of
the
nobler
qualities
of
man
it
is
not
only
a
sense
of
honour
which
binds
him
to
a
woman
who
has
given
him
all
she
has
to
give
separation
seems
unnatural
monstrous
a
divorce
from
himself
it
is
not
she
alone
but
it
is
himself
whom
he
abandons
frank
s
duty
too
pointed
imperiously
to
the
path
he
ought
to
take
duty
to
the
child
as
well
as
to
the
mother
he
determined
to
go
home
secretly
mrs
caffyn
would
not
have
written
if
she
had
not
seen
good
reason
for
believing
that
madge
still
belonged
to
him
he
made
up
his
mind
to
start
the
next
day
but
when
the
next
day
came
instructions
to
go
immediately
to
hamburg
arrived
from
his
father
there
were
rumours
of
the
insolvency
of
a
house
with
which
mr
palmer
dealt
inquiries
were
necessary
which
could
better
be
made
personally
and
if
these
rumours
were
correct
as
mr
palmer
believed
them
to
be
his
agency
must
be
transferred
to
some
other
firm
there
was
now
no
possibility
of
a
journey
to
england
for
a
moment
he
debated
whether
when
he
was
at
hamburg
he
could
not
slip
over
to
london
but
it
would
be
dangerous
further
orders
might
come
from
his
father
and
the
failure
to
acknowledge
them
would
lead
to
evasion
and
perhaps
to
discovery
he
must
therefore
content
himself
with
a
written
explanation
to
mrs
caffyn
why
he
could
not
meet
her
and
there
should
be
one
more
effort
to
make
atonement
to
madge
this
was
what
went
to
mrs
caffyn
and
to
her
lodger
dear
madam
note
has
reached
me
here
i
am
very
sorry
that
my
engagements
are
so
pressing
that
i
can
not
leave
germany
at
present
i
have
written
to
miss
hopgood
there
is
one
subject
which
i
can
not
mention
to
can
not
speak
to
her
about
money
will
you
please
give
me
full
information
i
enclose
and
i
must
trust
to
your
discretion
i
thank
you
heartily
for
all
your
yours
frank
my
dearest
madge
can
not
help
saying
one
more
word
to
you
although
when
i
last
saw
you
you
told
me
that
it
was
useless
for
me
to
hope
i
know
however
that
there
is
now
another
bond
between
us
the
child
is
mine
as
well
as
yours
and
if
i
am
not
all
that
you
deserve
ought
you
to
prevent
me
from
doing
my
duty
to
it
as
well
as
to
you
it
is
true
that
if
we
were
to
marry
i
could
never
right
you
and
perhaps
my
father
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
us
but
in
time
he
might
relent
and
i
will
come
over
at
once
or
at
least
the
moment
i
have
settled
some
business
here
and
you
shall
be
my
wife
do
my
dearest
madge
when
he
came
to
this
point
his
pen
stopped
what
he
had
written
was
very
smooth
but
very
tame
and
cold
however
nothing
better
presented
itself
he
changed
his
position
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
searched
himself
but
could
find
nothing
it
was
not
always
so
some
months
ago
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
and
he
would
not
have
known
when
to
come
to
an
end
the
same
thing
would
have
been
said
a
dozen
times
perhaps
but
it
would
not
have
seemed
the
same
to
him
and
each
succeeding
repetition
would
have
been
felt
with
the
force
of
novelty
he
took
a
scrap
of
paper
and
tried
to
draft
two
or
three
sentences
altered
them
several
times
and
made
them
worse
he
then
the
letter
it
was
too
short
but
after
all
it
contained
what
was
necessary
and
it
must
go
as
it
stood
she
knew
how
he
felt
towards
her
so
he
signed
it
after
giving
his
address
at
hamburg
and
it
was
posted
three
or
four
days
afterwards
mrs
marshall
in
accordance
with
her
usual
custom
went
to
see
madge
before
she
was
up
the
child
lay
peacefully
by
its
mother
s
side
and
frank
s
letter
was
upon
the
counterpane
the
resolution
that
no
letter
from
him
should
be
opened
had
been
broken
the
two
women
had
become
great
friends
and
within
the
last
few
weeks
madge
had
compelled
mrs
marshall
to
call
her
by
her
christian
name
you
ve
had
a
letter
from
mr
palmer
i
was
sure
it
was
his
handwriting
when
it
came
late
last
you
can
read
it
there
is
nothing
private
in
she
turned
round
to
the
child
and
mrs
marshall
sat
down
and
read
when
she
had
finished
she
laid
the
letter
on
the
bed
again
and
was
silent
well
said
madge
would
you
say
no
yes
i
for
your
own
sake
as
well
as
for
his
mrs
marshall
took
up
the
letter
and
read
half
of
it
again
yes
you
had
better
say
you
will
find
it
dull
especially
if
you
have
to
live
in
did
you
find
london
dull
when
you
came
to
live
in
it
rather
marshall
is
away
all
day
but
scarcely
any
woman
in
london
expects
to
marry
a
man
who
is
not
away
all
they
ought
then
to
have
heaps
of
work
or
they
ought
to
have
a
lot
of
children
to
look
after
but
perhaps
being
born
and
bred
in
the
country
i
do
not
know
what
people
in
london
are
recollect
you
were
country
born
and
bred
yourself
or
at
anyrate
you
have
lived
in
the
country
for
the
most
of
your
dull
we
must
all
expect
to
be
there
s
nothing
worse
i
ve
had
rheumatic
fever
and
i
say
give
me
the
fever
rather
than
what
comes
over
me
at
times
here
if
marshall
had
not
been
so
good
to
me
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
have
done
with
madge
turned
round
and
looked
mrs
marshall
straight
in
the
face
but
she
did
not
flinch
marshall
is
very
good
to
me
but
i
was
glad
when
mother
and
you
and
your
sister
came
to
keep
me
company
when
he
is
not
at
home
it
tired
me
to
have
my
meals
alone
it
is
bad
for
the
digestion
at
least
so
he
says
and
he
believes
that
it
was
indigestion
that
was
the
matter
with
me
i
should
be
sorry
for
myself
if
you
were
to
go
away
not
that
i
want
to
put
that
forward
maybe
i
should
never
see
much
more
of
you
he
is
rich
you
might
come
here
sometimes
but
he
would
not
like
to
have
marshall
and
mother
and
me
at
his
not
a
word
was
spoken
for
at
least
a
minute
suddenly
mrs
marshall
took
madge
s
hand
in
her
own
hands
leaned
over
her
and
in
that
kind
of
whisper
with
which
we
wake
a
sleeper
who
is
to
be
aroused
to
escape
from
sudden
peril
she
said
in
her
ear
madge
madge
for
god
s
sake
leave
him
i
have
left
are
you
sure
for
ever
for
ever
mrs
marshall
let
go
madge
s
hand
turned
her
eyes
towards
her
intently
for
a
moment
and
again
bent
over
her
as
if
she
were
about
to
embrace
her
a
knock
however
came
at
the
door
and
mrs
caffyn
entered
with
the
cup
of
coffee
which
she
always
insisted
on
bringing
before
madge
rose
after
she
and
her
daughter
had
left
madge
read
the
letter
once
more
there
was
nothing
new
in
it
but
formally
it
was
something
like
the
tolling
of
the
bell
when
we
know
that
our
friend
is
dead
there
was
a
little
sobbing
and
then
she
kissed
her
child
with
such
eagerness
that
it
began
to
cry
you
ll
answer
that
letter
i
suppose
said
mrs
caffyn
when
they
were
alone
i
m
rather
glad
it
would
worrit
you
and
there
s
nothing
worse
for
a
baby
than
worritin
when
it
s
mother
s
mr
caffyn
wrote
as
follows
dear
sir
was
sorry
as
you
couldn
t
come
but
i
believe
now
as
it
was
better
as
you
didn
t
i
am
no
scollard
and
so
no
more
from
your
obedient
humble
servant
mrs
caffyn
return
the
money
having
no
use
for
the
same
chapter
xxii
baruch
did
not
obtain
any
very
definite
information
from
marshall
about
clara
he
was
told
that
she
had
a
sister
that
they
were
both
of
them
gentlewomen
that
their
mother
and
father
were
dead
that
they
were
great
readers
and
that
they
did
not
go
to
church
nor
chapel
but
that
they
both
went
sometimes
to
hear
a
certain
mr
scott
lecture
he
was
once
assistant
minister
to
irving
but
was
now
heretical
and
had
a
congregation
of
his
own
creating
at
woolwich
baruch
called
at
the
shop
and
found
clara
once
more
alone
the
book
was
packed
up
and
had
being
lying
ready
for
him
for
two
or
three
days
he
wanted
to
speak
but
hardly
knew
how
to
begin
he
looked
idly
round
the
shelves
taking
down
one
volume
after
another
and
at
last
he
said
i
suppose
nobody
but
myself
has
ever
asked
for
a
copy
of
robinson
not
since
i
have
been
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
he
printed
only
two
hundred
and
fifty
he
gave
away
and
i
am
sure
nearly
two
hundred
were
sold
as
he
is
a
friend
of
yours
he
was
a
friend
he
is
dead
he
was
an
usher
in
a
private
school
although
you
might
have
supposed
from
the
title
selected
that
he
was
a
clerk
i
told
him
it
was
useless
to
publish
and
his
publishers
told
him
the
same
i
should
have
thought
that
some
notice
would
have
been
taken
of
him
he
is
so
evidently
worth
yes
but
although
he
was
original
and
reflective
he
had
no
particular
talent
his
excellence
lay
in
criticism
and
observation
often
profound
on
what
came
to
him
every
day
and
he
was
valueless
in
the
literary
market
a
talent
of
some
kind
is
necessary
to
genius
if
it
is
to
be
heard
so
he
died
utterly
unrecognised
save
by
one
or
two
personal
friends
who
loved
him
dearly
he
was
peculiar
in
the
depth
and
intimacy
of
his
friendships
few
men
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
friendship
they
consort
with
certain
companions
and
perhaps
very
earnestly
admire
them
because
they
possess
intellectual
gifts
but
of
friendship
such
as
we
two
morris
and
i
for
that
was
his
real
name
understood
it
they
know
do
you
believe
that
the
good
does
not
necessarily
survive
yes
and
no
i
believe
that
power
every
moment
so
far
as
our
eyes
can
follow
it
is
utterly
lost
i
have
had
one
or
two
friends
whom
the
world
has
never
known
and
never
will
know
who
have
more
in
them
than
is
to
be
found
in
many
an
english
classic
i
could
take
you
to
a
little
dissenting
chapel
not
very
far
from
holborn
where
you
would
hear
a
young
welshman
with
no
education
beyond
that
provided
by
a
welsh
denominational
college
who
is
a
perfect
orator
and
whose
depth
of
insight
is
hardly
to
be
matched
save
by
thomas
à
kempis
whom
he
much
resembles
when
he
dies
he
will
be
forgotten
in
a
dozen
years
besides
it
is
surely
plain
enough
to
everybody
that
there
are
thousands
of
men
and
women
within
a
mile
of
us
apathetic
and
obscure
who
if
an
object
worthy
of
them
had
been
presented
to
them
would
have
shown
themselves
capable
of
enthusiasm
and
heroism
huge
volumes
of
human
energy
are
apparently
it
is
very
shocking
worse
to
me
than
the
thought
of
the
earthquake
or
the
i
said
yes
and
no
and
there
is
another
side
the
universe
is
so
wonderful
so
intricate
that
it
is
impossible
to
trace
the
transformation
of
its
forces
and
when
they
seem
to
disappear
the
disappearance
may
be
an
illusion
moreover
waste
is
a
word
which
is
applicable
only
to
finite
resources
if
the
resources
are
infinite
it
has
no
two
customers
came
in
and
baruch
was
obliged
to
leave
when
he
came
to
reflect
he
was
surprised
to
find
not
only
how
much
he
had
said
but
what
he
had
said
he
was
usually
reserved
and
with
strangers
he
adhered
to
the
weather
or
to
passing
events
he
had
spoken
however
to
this
young
woman
as
if
they
had
been
acquainted
for
years
clara
too
was
surprised
she
always
cut
short
attempts
at
conversation
in
the
shop
frequently
she
answered
questions
and
receipted
and
returned
bills
without
looking
in
the
faces
of
the
people
who
spoke
to
her
or
offered
her
the
money
but
to
this
foreigner
or
jew
she
had
disclosed
something
she
felt
she
was
rather
abashed
but
presently
her
employer
mr
barnes
returned
and
somewhat
relieved
her
the
gentleman
who
bought
office
came
for
it
while
you
were
out
oh
what
cohen
good
fellow
cohen
is
he
it
was
who
recommended
you
to
me
he
is
to
your
clara
was
comforted
he
was
not
a
mere
casual
as
mr
barnes
called
his
chance
customers
chapter
xxiii
about
a
fortnight
afterwards
on
a
sunday
afternoon
cohen
went
to
the
marshalls
he
had
called
there
once
or
twice
since
his
came
to
london
but
had
seen
nothing
of
the
lodgers
it
was
just
about
but
unfortunately
marshall
and
his
wife
had
gone
out
mrs
caffyn
insisted
that
cohen
should
stay
but
madge
could
not
be
persuaded
to
come
downstairs
and
baruch
mrs
caffyn
and
clara
had
tea
by
themselves
baruch
asked
mrs
caffyn
if
she
could
endure
london
after
living
for
so
long
in
the
country
ah
my
dear
boy
i
have
to
like
no
you
haven
t
what
you
mean
is
that
whether
you
like
it
or
whether
you
do
not
you
have
to
put
up
with
no
i
don
t
mean
that
miss
hopgood
cohen
and
me
we
are
the
best
of
friends
but
whenever
he
comes
here
he
allus
begins
to
argue
with
me
howsomever
arguing
isn
t
everything
is
it
my
dear
there
s
some
things
after
all
as
i
can
do
and
he
can
t
but
he
s
just
wrong
here
in
his
arguing
that
wasn
t
what
i
meant
i
meant
what
i
said
as
i
had
to
like
how
can
you
like
it
if
you
don
t
how
can
i
that
shows
you
re
a
man
and
not
a
woman
jess
like
you
men
do
what
you
didn
t
like
i
know
for
you
re
a
good
everybody
would
know
you
didn
t
like
what
would
be
the
use
of
me
in
a
house
if
i
didn
t
like
it
my
daughter
and
these
dear
young
women
if
it
comes
to
livin
you
d
ten
thousand
times
better
say
at
once
as
you
hate
bein
where
you
are
than
go
about
all
day
long
as
if
you
was
a
blessed
saint
and
put
mrs
caffyn
twitched
at
her
gown
and
pulled
it
down
over
her
knees
and
brushed
the
crumbs
off
with
energy
she
continued
i
can
t
abide
people
who
everlastin
make
believe
they
are
put
upon
suppose
i
were
allus
every
foggy
day
after
great
oakhurst
and
yet
my
daughter
as
i
knew
my
place
was
here
if
i
was
she
i
should
wish
my
mother
at
then
you
really
prefer
london
to
great
oakhurst
said
clara
why
my
dear
of
course
i
do
don
t
you
think
it
s
pleasanter
being
here
with
you
and
your
sister
and
that
precious
little
creature
and
my
daughter
than
down
in
that
place
not
that
i
don
t
miss
my
walk
sometimes
into
darkin
you
remember
that
way
as
i
took
you
once
baruch
across
the
hill
and
we
went
over
ranmore
common
and
i
showed
you
camilla
lacy
and
you
said
as
you
knew
a
woman
who
wrote
books
who
once
lived
there
you
remember
them
ah
it
was
one
october
weren
t
they
a
t
they
lovely
baruch
remembered
them
well
enough
who
that
had
ever
seen
them
could
forget
them
and
it
was
i
as
took
you
you
wouldn
t
think
it
my
dear
though
he
s
always
i
do
believe
he
d
love
to
go
that
walk
again
even
with
an
old
woman
and
see
them
heavenly
beeches
but
lord
how
i
do
talk
and
you
ve
neither
of
you
got
any
have
you
lived
long
in
london
miss
hopgood
inquired
baruch
not
very
do
you
feel
the
change
i
can
not
say
i
do
i
suppose
however
you
have
brought
yourself
to
believe
in
mrs
caffyn
s
philosophy
i
can
not
say
that
but
i
may
say
that
i
am
scarcely
strong
enough
for
mere
endurance
and
i
therefore
always
endeavour
to
find
something
agreeable
in
circumstances
from
which
there
is
no
the
recognition
of
the
one
in
the
many
had
as
great
a
charm
for
baruch
as
it
had
for
socrates
and
clara
spoke
with
the
ease
of
a
person
whose
habit
it
was
to
deal
with
principles
and
generalisations
yes
and
mere
toleration
to
say
nothing
of
opposition
at
least
so
far
as
persons
are
concerned
is
seldom
necessary
it
is
generally
thought
that
what
is
called
dramatic
power
is
a
poetic
gift
but
it
is
really
an
indispensable
virtue
to
all
of
us
if
we
are
to
be
mrs
caffyn
did
not
take
much
interest
in
abstract
statements
you
remember
she
said
turning
to
baruch
that
man
chorley
as
has
the
big
farm
on
the
side
just
afore
you
come
to
the
common
he
wasn
t
a
surrey
man
he
came
out
of
the
very
he
s
married
that
skelton
girl
married
her
the
week
afore
i
left
there
isn
t
no
love
lost
there
but
the
girl
s
father
said
he
d
murder
him
if
he
didn
t
and
so
it
come
off
how
she
ever
brought
herself
to
it
gets
over
me
she
has
that
big
and
he
s
made
a
fine
out
of
the
livin
room
on
the
side
as
you
go
in
and
put
a
new
grate
in
the
kitchen
and
turned
that
into
the
livin
room
and
they
does
the
cooking
in
the
back
kitchen
but
for
all
that
if
i
d
been
her
i
d
never
have
seen
his
face
no
more
and
i
d
have
packed
off
to
does
anybody
go
near
them
near
them
of
course
they
do
and
as
true
as
i
m
here
our
parson
who
married
them
went
to
the
breakfast
it
isn
t
chorley
as
i
blame
so
much
he
s
a
poor
snivellin
creature
and
he
was
frightened
but
it
s
the
girl
she
doesn
t
care
for
him
no
more
than
me
and
then
again
although
as
i
tell
you
he
s
such
a
poor
creature
he
s
awful
cruel
and
mean
and
she
knows
it
but
what
was
i
to
say
never
shall
i
forget
that
wedding
you
know
as
it
s
a
short
cut
to
the
church
across
the
farmyard
at
the
back
of
my
house
the
parson
he
was
rather
suppose
he
d
been
giving
himself
a
finishin
as
it
had
been
very
dry
weather
he
went
across
the
straw
and
stuff
just
at
the
edge
like
of
the
yard
there
was
a
pig
under
the
my
dear
turning
to
clara
nuzzle
under
the
straw
so
as
you
can
t
see
them
just
as
he
came
to
this
pig
it
started
up
and
upset
him
and
he
fell
and
straddled
across
its
back
and
the
lord
have
mercy
on
me
if
it
didn
t
carry
him
at
an
awful
rate
as
if
he
was
a
jockey
at
epsom
races
till
it
come
to
a
puddle
of
dung
water
and
then
down
he
plumped
in
it
you
never
see
d
a
man
in
such
a
pickle
i
heer
d
the
pig
like
mad
and
i
ran
to
the
door
and
i
called
out
to
him
and
i
says
mr
ormiston
won
t
you
come
in
here
and
though
as
you
know
he
allus
hated
me
he
had
to
come
mussy
on
us
how
he
did
stink
and
he
saw
me
turn
up
my
nose
and
he
was
wild
with
rage
and
he
called
the
pig
a
filthy
beast
i
says
to
him
as
that
was
the
pig
s
way
and
the
pig
didn
t
know
who
it
was
who
was
it
and
i
took
his
coat
off
and
wiped
his
stockings
and
sent
to
the
rectory
for
another
coat
and
he
crept
up
under
the
hedge
to
his
garden
and
went
home
and
the
people
at
church
had
to
wait
for
an
hour
i
was
glad
i
was
goin
away
from
great
oakhurst
for
he
never
would
have
forgiven
there
was
a
ring
at
the
front
door
bell
and
clara
went
to
see
who
was
there
it
was
a
runaway
ring
but
she
took
the
opportunity
of
going
upstairs
to
madge
she
has
a
sister
said
baruch
yes
and
i
may
just
as
well
tell
you
about
her
what
i
i
believe
as
i
know
pretty
near
everything
about
her
you
ll
have
to
be
told
if
they
stay
here
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
and
how
it
came
about
with
a
girl
like
that
is
a
bit
beyond
me
anyhow
there
s
a
child
and
the
father
s
a
good
sort
by
what
i
can
make
out
but
she
won
t
have
anything
more
to
do
with
what
do
you
mean
by
a
girl
like
she
isn
t
one
of
them
as
goes
wrong
she
can
talk
german
and
reads
did
he
desert
her
no
that
s
just
it
she
loves
me
although
i
say
it
as
if
i
was
her
mother
and
yet
i
m
just
as
much
in
the
dark
as
i
was
the
first
day
i
saw
her
as
to
why
she
left
that
mrs
caffyn
wiped
the
corners
of
her
eyes
with
her
apron
it
s
gospel
truth
as
i
never
took
to
anybody
as
i
ve
took
to
after
baruch
had
gone
clara
returned
he
s
a
curious
creature
my
dear
said
mrs
caffyn
as
good
as
gold
but
he
s
too
solemn
by
half
it
would
do
him
a
world
of
good
if
he
d
somebody
with
him
who
d
make
him
laugh
more
he
laugh
for
i
ve
seen
him
forced
to
get
up
and
hold
his
sides
but
he
never
makes
no
noise
he
s
a
jew
and

as

as

chapter
xxiv
baruch
was
now
in
love
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
clara
suddenly
and
totally
his
tendency
to
reflectiveness
did
not
diminish
his
passion
it
rather
augmented
it
the
men
and
women
whose
thoughts
are
here
and
there
continually
are
not
the
people
to
feel
the
full
force
of
love
those
who
do
feel
it
are
those
who
are
accustomed
to
think
of
one
thing
at
a
time
and
to
think
upon
it
for
a
long
time
no
man
said
baruch
once
can
love
a
woman
unless
he
loves
i
should
say
smilingly
replied
the
gentile
that
no
man
can
love
god
unless
he
loves
a
i
am
right
said
baruch
and
so
are
but
baruch
looked
in
the
glass
his
hair
jet
black
when
he
was
a
youth
was
marked
with
grey
and
once
more
the
thought
came
to
time
with
peculiar
he
could
not
now
expect
a
woman
to
love
him
as
she
had
a
right
to
demand
that
he
should
love
and
that
he
must
be
silent
he
was
obliged
to
call
upon
barnes
in
about
a
fortnight
s
time
he
still
read
hebrew
and
he
had
seen
in
the
shop
a
copy
of
the
hebrew
translation
of
the
of
maimonides
which
he
greatly
coveted
but
could
not
afford
to
buy
like
every
true
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
when
he
wished
for
a
book
which
was
beyond
his
means
that
he
ought
once
for
all
to
renounce
it
and
he
was
guilty
of
subterfuges
quite
unworthy
of
such
a
reasonable
creature
in
order
to
delude
himself
into
the
belief
that
he
might
yield
for
example
he
wanted
a
new
overcoat
badly
but
determined
it
was
more
prudent
to
wait
and
a
week
afterwards
very
nearly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
as
he
had
not
ordered
the
coat
he
had
actually
accumulated
a
fund
from
which
the
might
be
purchased
when
he
came
to
the
shop
he
saw
barnes
was
there
and
he
persuaded
himself
he
should
have
a
quieter
moment
or
two
with
the
precious
volume
when
clara
was
alone
barnes
of
course
gossiped
with
everybody
he
therefore
called
again
in
the
evening
about
half
an
hour
before
closing
time
and
found
that
barnes
had
gone
home
clara
was
busy
with
a
catalogue
the
proof
of
which
she
was
particularly
anxious
to
send
to
the
printer
that
night
he
did
not
disturb
her
but
took
down
the
maimonides
and
for
a
few
moments
was
lost
in
revolving
the
doctrine
afterwards
repeated
and
proved
by
a
greater
than
maimonides
that
the
will
and
power
of
god
are
that
there
is
nothing
which
might
be
and
is
not
it
was
familiar
to
baruch
but
like
all
ideas
of
that
quality
and
there
are
not
many
of
was
always
new
and
affected
him
like
a
starry
night
seen
hundreds
of
times
yet
for
ever
infinite
and
original
but
was
it
maimonides
which
kept
him
till
the
porter
began
to
put
up
the
shutters
was
he
pondering
exclusively
upon
god
as
the
folio
lay
open
before
him
he
did
think
about
him
but
whether
he
would
have
thought
about
him
for
nearly
twenty
minutes
if
clara
had
not
been
there
is
another
matter
do
you
walk
home
alone
he
said
as
she
gave
the
proof
to
the
boy
who
stood
waiting
yes
i
am
going
to
see
marshall
but
i
must
go
to
newman
street
first
i
shall
be
glad
to
walk
with
you
if
you
do
not
mind
diverging
a
she
consented
and
they
went
along
oxford
street
without
speaking
the
roar
of
the
carriages
and
waggons
preventing
a
word
they
turned
however
into
bloomsbury
and
were
able
to
hear
one
another
he
had
much
to
say
and
he
could
not
begin
to
say
it
there
was
a
great
mass
of
something
to
be
communicated
pent
up
within
him
and
he
would
have
liked
to
pour
it
all
out
before
her
at
once
it
is
just
at
such
times
that
we
often
take
up
as
a
means
of
expression
and
relief
that
which
is
absurdly
inexpressive
and
irrelevant
i
have
not
seen
your
sister
yet
i
hope
i
may
see
her
this
i
hope
you
may
but
she
frequently
suffers
from
headache
and
prefers
to
be
how
do
you
like
mr
barnes
the
answer
is
not
worth
recording
nor
is
any
question
or
answer
which
was
asked
or
returned
for
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
worth
recording
although
they
were
so
interesting
then
when
they
were
crossing
bedford
square
on
their
return
clara
happened
to
say
amongst
other
commonplaces
what
a
relief
a
quiet
space
in
london
i
do
not
mind
the
crowd
if
i
am
by
i
do
not
like
crowds
i
dislike
even
the
word
and
dislike
the
masses
still
more
i
do
not
want
to
think
of
human
beings
as
if
they
were
a
cloud
of
dust
and
as
if
each
atom
had
no
separate
importance
london
is
often
horrible
to
me
for
that
reason
in
the
country
it
was
not
quite
so
that
is
an
illusion
said
baruch
after
a
moment
s
pause
i
do
not
quite
understand
you
but
if
it
be
an
illusion
it
is
very
painful
in
london
human
beings
seem
the
commonest
cheapest
things
in
the
world
and
i
am
one
of
them
i
went
with
mr
marshall
not
long
ago
to
a
free
trade
meeting
and
more
than
two
thousand
people
were
present
everybody
told
me
it
was
magnificent
but
it
made
me
very
she
was
going
on
but
she
stopped
how
was
it
she
thought
again
that
she
could
be
so
communicative
how
was
it
how
is
it
that
sometimes
a
stranger
crosses
our
path
with
whom
before
we
have
known
him
for
more
than
an
hour
we
have
no
secrets
an
hour
we
have
actually
known
him
for
centuries
she
could
not
understand
it
and
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
inconsistent
with
her
constant
professions
of
wariness
in
it
is
an
illusion
illusion
of
the
senses
it
is
difficult
to
make
what
i
mean
clear
because
insight
is
not
possible
beyond
a
certain
point
and
clearness
does
not
come
until
penetration
is
complete
and
what
we
acquire
is
brought
into
a
line
with
other
acquisitions
it
constantly
happens
that
we
are
arrested
short
of
this
point
but
it
would
be
wrong
to
suppose
that
our
conclusions
if
we
may
call
them
so
are
of
no
she
was
silent
and
he
did
not
go
on
at
last
he
said
the
illusion
lies
in
supposing
that
number
quantity
and
terms
of
that
kind
are
applicable
to
any
other
than
sensuous
objects
but
i
can
not
go
further
at
least
not
now
after
all
it
is
possible
here
in
london
for
one
atom
to
be
of
eternal
importance
to
they
had
gone
quite
round
bedford
square
without
entering
great
russell
street
which
was
the
way
eastwards
a
drunken
man
was
holding
on
by
the
railings
of
the
square
he
had
apparently
been
hesitating
for
some
time
whether
he
could
reach
the
road
and
just
as
baruch
and
clara
came
up
to
him
he
made
a
lurch
towards
it
and
nearly
fell
over
them
clara
instinctively
seized
baruch
s
arm
in
order
to
avoid
the
poor
staggering
mortal
they
went
once
more
to
the
right
and
began
to
complete
another
circuit
somehow
her
arm
had
been
drawn
into
baruch
s
and
there
it
remained
have
you
any
friends
in
london
said
baruch
there
are
mrs
caffyn
her
son
and
daughter
and
there
is
mr
scott
he
was
a
friend
of
my
you
mean
the
mr
scott
who
was
irving
s
assistant
an
he
was
about
to
say
an
additional
bond
but
he
corrected
himself
a
bond
between
us
i
know
mr
do
you
really
i
suppose
you
know
many
interesting
people
in
london
as
you
are
in
his
very
few
weeks
months
have
passed
since
anybody
has
said
as
much
to
me
as
you
his
voice
quivered
a
little
for
he
was
trembling
with
an
emotion
quite
inexplicable
by
mere
intellectual
relationship
something
came
through
clara
s
glove
as
her
hand
rested
on
his
wrist
which
ran
through
every
nerve
and
sent
the
blood
into
his
head
clara
felt
his
excitement
and
dreaded
lest
he
should
say
something
to
which
she
could
give
no
answer
and
when
they
came
opposite
great
russell
street
she
withdrew
her
arm
from
his
and
began
to
cross
to
the
opposite
pavement
she
turned
the
conversation
towards
some
indifferent
subject
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
at
great
ormond
street
baruch
would
not
go
in
as
he
had
intended
he
thought
it
was
about
to
rain
and
he
was
late
as
he
went
along
he
became
calmer
and
when
he
was
fairly
indoors
he
had
passed
into
a
despair
entirely
the
philosopher
baruch
as
inconsistent
as
the
irrational
behaviour
in
bedford
square
he
could
well
enough
interpret
so
he
believed
miss
hopgood
s
suppression
of
him
ass
that
he
was
not
to
see
what
he
ought
to
have
known
so
well
that
he
was
playing
the
fool
to
her
he
with
a
son
to
pretend
to
romance
with
a
girl
at
that
moment
she
might
be
mocking
him
or
if
she
was
too
good
for
mockery
she
might
be
contriving
to
avoid
or
to
quench
him
the
next
time
he
met
her
he
would
be
made
to
understand
that
he
was
and
perhaps
he
would
then
learn
the
name
of
the
youth
who
was
his
rival
and
had
won
her
he
would
often
meet
her
no
doubt
but
of
what
value
would
anything
he
could
say
be
to
her
she
could
not
be
expected
to
make
fine
distinctions
and
there
was
a
class
of
elderly
men
to
which
of
course
he
would
be
assigned
but
the
thought
was
too
horrible
perhaps
his
love
for
clara
might
be
genuine
perhaps
it
was
not
he
had
hoped
that
as
he
grew
older
he
might
be
able
really
to
a
woman
but
he
was
once
more
like
one
of
the
possessed
it
was
not
clara
hopgood
who
was
before
him
it
was
hair
lips
eyes
just
as
it
was
twenty
years
ago
just
as
it
was
with
the
commonest
he
met
who
had
escaped
from
the
counter
and
was
waiting
at
an
area
gate
it
was
terrible
to
him
to
find
that
he
had
so
nearly
lost
his
but
upon
this
point
he
was
unjust
to
himself
for
we
are
often
more
distinctly
aware
of
the
strength
of
the
temptation
than
of
the
authority
within
us
which
falteringly
but
decisively
enables
us
at
last
to
resist
it
then
he
fell
to
meditating
how
little
his
studies
had
done
for
him
what
was
the
use
of
them
they
had
not
made
him
any
stronger
and
he
was
no
better
able
than
other
people
to
resist
temptation
after
twenty
years
continuous
labour
he
found
himself
capable
of
the
vulgarest
coarsest
faults
and
failings
from
which
the
remotest
skiey
influence
in
his
begetting
might
have
saved
him
clara
was
not
as
baruch
no
such
storm
as
that
which
had
darkened
and
disheartened
him
could
pass
over
her
but
she
could
love
perhaps
better
than
he
and
she
began
to
love
him
it
was
very
natural
to
a
woman
such
as
clara
for
she
had
met
a
man
who
had
said
to
her
that
what
she
believed
was
really
of
some
worth
her
father
and
mother
had
been
very
dear
to
her
her
sister
was
very
dear
to
her
but
she
had
never
received
any
such
recognition
as
that
which
had
now
been
offered
to
her
her
own
self
had
never
been
returned
to
her
with
such
honour
she
thought
should
she
not
think
it
the
future
of
the
release
from
her
dreary
occupation
of
a
happy
home
with
independence
and
she
thought
of
the
children
that
might
be
she
lay
down
without
any
misgiving
she
was
sure
he
was
in
love
with
her
she
did
not
know
much
of
him
certainly
in
the
usual
meaning
of
the
word
but
she
knew
enough
she
would
like
to
find
out
more
of
his
history
perhaps
without
exciting
suspicion
she
might
obtain
it
from
mrs
caffyn
chapter
xxv
mr
frank
palmer
was
back
again
in
england
he
was
much
distressed
when
he
received
that
last
letter
from
mrs
caffyn
and
discovered
that
madge
s
resolution
not
to
write
remained
unshaken
he
was
really
distressed
but
he
was
not
the
man
upon
whom
an
event
however
deeply
felt
at
the
time
could
score
a
furrow
which
could
not
be
obliterated
if
he
had
been
a
dramatic
personage
what
had
happened
to
him
would
have
been
the
second
act
leading
to
a
fifth
in
which
the
fates
would
have
appeared
but
life
seldom
arranges
itself
in
proper
poetic
form
a
man
determines
that
he
must
marry
he
makes
the
an
allowance
never
sees
her
or
her
child
again
transforms
himself
into
a
model
husband
is
beloved
by
his
wife
and
family
the
woman
whom
he
kissed
as
he
will
never
kiss
his
lawful
partner
withdraws
completely
and
nothing
happens
to
him
frank
was
sure
he
could
never
love
anybody
as
he
had
loved
madge
nor
could
he
cut
indifferently
that
other
cord
which
bound
him
to
her
nobody
in
society
expects
the
same
paternal
love
for
the
offspring
of
a
housemaid
or
a
sempstress
as
for
the
child
of
the
stockbroker
s
or
brewer
s
daughter
and
nobody
expects
the
same
obligations
but
frank
was
not
a
society
youth
and
madge
was
his
equal
a
score
of
times
when
his
fancy
roved
the
rope
checked
him
as
suddenly
as
if
it
were
the
lasso
of
a
south
american
gaucho
but
what
could
he
do
that
was
the
point
there
were
one
or
two
things
which
he
could
have
done
perhaps
and
one
or
two
things
which
he
could
not
have
done
if
he
had
been
made
of
different
stuff
but
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
which
frank
palmer
could
do
after
all
it
was
better
that
madge
should
be
the
child
s
mother
than
that
it
should
belong
to
some
peasant
at
least
it
would
be
properly
educated
as
to
money
mrs
caffyn
had
told
him
expressly
that
she
did
not
want
it
that
might
be
nothing
but
pride
and
he
resolved
without
very
clearly
seeing
how
and
without
troubling
himself
for
the
moment
as
to
details
that
madge
should
be
entirely
and
handsomely
supported
by
him
meanwhile
it
was
of
great
importance
that
he
should
behave
in
such
a
manner
as
to
raise
no
suspicion
he
did
not
particularly
care
for
some
time
after
his
return
from
germany
to
go
out
to
the
musical
parties
to
which
he
was
constantly
invited
but
he
went
as
a
duty
and
wherever
he
went
he
met
his
charming
cousin
they
always
sang
together
they
had
easy
opportunities
of
practising
together
and
frank
although
nothing
definite
was
said
to
him
soon
found
that
his
family
and
hers
considered
him
destined
for
her
he
could
not
retreat
and
there
was
no
surprise
manifested
by
anybody
when
it
was
rumoured
that
they
were
engaged
his
story
may
as
well
be
finished
at
once
he
and
miss
cecilia
morland
were
married
a
few
days
before
the
wedding
when
some
legal
arrangements
and
settlements
were
necessary
frank
made
one
last
effort
to
secure
an
income
for
madge
but
it
failed
mrs
caffyn
met
him
by
appointment
but
he
could
not
persuade
her
even
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
madge
he
then
determined
to
confess
his
fears
to
his
great
relief
mrs
caffyn
of
her
own
accord
assured
him
that
he
never
need
dread
any
disturbance
or
betrayal
there
are
three
of
us
she
said
as
knows
madge
miss
clara
and
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
we
are
dead
and
buried
i
can
t
say
as
i
was
altogether
of
miss
madge
s
way
of
looking
at
it
at
first
and
i
thought
it
ought
to
have
been
different
though
i
believe
now
as
she
s
right
but
and
the
old
woman
suddenly
fired
up
as
if
some
bolt
from
heaven
had
kindled
her
i
pity
you
sir
i
nor
i
do
her
you
little
know
what
you
ve
lost
the
blessedest
sweetest
ah
and
the
cleverest
creature
too
as
ever
i
set
eyes
but
mrs
caffyn
said
frank
with
much
emotion
it
was
not
i
who
left
her
you
know
it
was
not
and
and
the
word
now
was
coming
but
it
did
not
come
ah
said
mrs
caffyn
with
something
like
scorn
know
yes
i
do
know
it
was
she
you
needn
t
tell
me
that
but
in
heaven
if
i
d
been
you
i
d
have
laid
myself
on
the
ground
afore
her
i
d
have
tore
my
heart
out
for
her
and
i
d
have
said
no
other
woman
in
this
world
but
you
there
what
a
fool
i
am
goodbye
mr
she
marched
away
leaving
frank
very
miserable
and
as
he
imagined
unsettled
but
he
was
not
so
the
fit
lasted
all
day
but
when
he
was
walking
home
that
evening
he
met
a
poor
friend
whose
wife
was
dying
i
am
so
grieved
said
frank
to
hear
of
your
hope
none
i
am
it
is
very
yes
it
is
hard
to
bear
but
to
what
is
inevitable
we
must
this
new
phrase
struck
frank
very
much
and
it
seemed
very
philosophic
to
him
a
maxim
for
guidance
through
life
it
did
not
strike
him
that
it
was
generally
either
a
platitude
or
an
excuse
for
weakness
and
that
a
nobler
duty
is
to
find
out
what
is
inevitable
and
what
is
not
to
declare
boldly
that
what
the
world
oftentimes
affirms
to
be
inevitable
is
really
evitable
and
heroically
to
set
about
making
it
so
even
if
revolt
be
perfectly
useless
we
are
not
particularly
drawn
to
a
man
who
prostrates
himself
too
soon
and
is
incapable
of
a
little
cursing
as
it
was
impossible
to
provide
for
madge
and
the
child
now
frank
considered
whether
he
could
not
do
something
for
them
in
the
will
which
he
had
to
make
before
his
marriage
he
might
help
his
daughter
if
he
could
not
help
the
mother
but
his
wife
would
perhaps
survive
him
and
the
discovery
would
cause
her
and
her
children
much
misery
it
would
damage
his
character
with
them
and
inflict
positive
moral
mischief
the
will
therefore
did
not
mention
madge
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
tell
his
secret
to
his
solicitor
the
wedding
took
place
amidst
much
rejoicing
everybody
thought
the
couple
were
most
delightfully
matched
the
presents
were
magnificent
the
happy
pair
went
to
switzerland
came
back
and
settled
in
one
of
the
smaller
of
the
old
red
brick
houses
in
stoke
newington
with
a
lawn
in
front
always
shaved
and
trimmed
to
the
last
degree
of
smoothness
and
accuracy
with
paths
on
whose
gravel
not
the
smallest
weed
was
ever
seen
and
with
a
that
provided
the
most
luscious
black
grapes
there
was
a
grand
piano
in
the
and
frank
and
cecilia
became
more
musical
than
ever
and
waltham
lodge
was
the
headquarters
of
a
little
amateur
orchestra
which
practised
mozart
and
haydn
and
gave
local
concerts
a
twelvemonth
after
the
marriage
a
son
was
born
and
frank
s
father
increased
frank
s
share
in
the
business
mr
palmer
had
long
ceased
to
take
any
interest
in
the
hopgoods
he
considered
that
madge
had
treated
frank
shamefully
in
jilting
him
but
was
convinced
that
he
was
fortunate
in
his
escape
it
was
clear
that
she
was
unstable
she
probably
threw
him
overboard
for
somebody
more
attractive
and
she
was
not
the
woman
to
be
a
wife
to
his
son
one
day
cecilia
was
turning
out
some
drawers
belonging
to
her
husband
and
she
found
a
dainty
little
slipper
wrapped
up
in
white
tissue
paper
she
looked
at
it
for
a
long
time
wondering
to
whom
it
could
have
belonged
and
had
half
a
mind
to
announce
her
discovery
to
frank
but
she
was
a
wise
woman
and
forbore
it
lay
underneath
some
neckties
which
were
not
now
worn
two
or
three
silk
pocket
handkerchiefs
also
discarded
and
some
manuscript
books
containing
school
themes
she
placed
them
on
the
top
of
the
drawers
as
if
they
had
all
been
taken
out
in
a
lump
and
the
slipper
was
at
the
bottom
frank
my
dear
she
said
after
dinner
i
emptied
this
morning
one
of
the
drawers
in
the
attic
i
wish
you
would
look
over
the
things
and
decide
what
you
wish
to
keep
i
have
not
examined
them
but
they
seem
to
be
mostly
he
went
upstairs
after
he
had
smoked
his
cigar
and
read
his
paper
there
was
the
slipper
it
all
came
back
to
him
that
night
when
she
rebuked
him
for
the
folly
of
kissing
her
foot
and
he
begged
the
slipper
and
determined
to
preserve
it
for
ever
and
thought
how
delightful
it
would
be
to
take
it
out
and
look
at
it
when
he
was
an
old
man
even
now
he
did
not
like
to
destroy
it
but
cecilia
might
have
seen
it
and
might
ask
him
what
he
had
done
with
it
and
what
could
he
say
finally
he
decided
to
burn
it
there
was
no
fire
however
in
the
room
and
while
he
stood
meditating
cecilia
called
him
he
replaced
the
slipper
in
the
drawer
he
could
not
return
that
evening
but
he
intended
to
go
back
the
next
morning
take
the
little
parcel
away
in
his
pocket
and
burn
it
at
his
office
at
breakfast
some
letters
came
which
put
everything
else
out
of
mind
the
first
thing
he
did
that
evening
was
to
revisit
the
garret
but
the
slipper
had
gone
cecilia
had
been
there
and
had
found
it
carefully
folded
up
in
the
drawer
she
pulled
it
out
snipped
and
tore
it
into
fifty
pieces
carried
them
downstairs
threw
them
on
the
fire
sat
down
before
it
poking
them
further
and
further
into
the
flames
and
watched
them
till
every
vestige
had
vanished
frank
did
not
like
to
make
any
inquiries
cecilia
made
none
and
no
trace
existed
at
waltham
lodge
of
madge
hopgood
chapter
xxvi
baruch
went
neither
to
barnes
s
shop
nor
to
the
marshalls
for
nearly
a
month
one
sunday
morning
he
was
poring
over
the
for
it
had
proved
too
powerful
a
temptation
for
him
and
he
fell
upon
the
theorem
that
without
god
the
universe
could
not
continue
to
exist
for
god
is
its
form
it
was
one
of
those
sayings
which
may
be
nothing
or
much
to
the
reader
whether
it
be
nothing
or
much
depends
upon
the
quality
of
his
mind
there
was
certainly
nothing
in
it
particularly
adapted
to
baruch
s
condition
at
that
moment
but
an
antidote
may
be
none
the
less
efficacious
because
it
is
not
direct
it
removed
him
to
another
region
it
was
like
the
sight
and
sound
of
the
sea
to
the
man
who
has
been
in
trouble
in
an
inland
city
his
was
restored
for
he
to
whom
an
idea
is
revealed
becomes
the
idea
and
is
no
longer
personal
and
consequently
poor
his
room
seemed
too
small
for
him
he
shut
his
book
and
went
to
great
ormond
street
he
found
there
marshall
mrs
caffyn
clara
and
a
friend
of
marshall
s
named
dennis
where
is
your
wife
said
baruch
to
marshall
gone
with
miss
madge
to
the
catholic
chapel
to
hear
a
mass
of
mozart
yes
said
mrs
caffyn
i
tell
them
they
ll
turn
papists
if
they
do
not
mind
they
are
always
going
to
that
place
and
there
s
no
knowing
so
i
ve
hear
d
what
them
priests
can
do
they
aren
t
like
our
parsons
catch
that
man
at
great
oakhurst
i
suppose
said
baruch
to
clara
it
is
the
music
takes
your
sister
there
mainly
i
believe
but
perhaps
not
what
other
attraction
can
there
be
i
am
not
in
the
least
disposed
to
become
a
convert
once
for
all
catholicism
is
incredible
and
that
is
sufficient
but
there
is
much
in
its
ritual
which
suits
me
there
is
no
such
intrusion
of
the
person
of
the
minister
as
there
is
in
the
church
of
england
and
still
worse
amongst
dissenters
in
the
catholic
service
the
priest
is
nothing
it
is
his
office
which
is
everything
he
is
a
mere
means
of
communication
the
mass
in
so
far
as
it
proclaims
that
miracle
is
not
dead
is
also
very
impressive
to
i
do
not
quite
understand
you
said
marshall
but
if
you
once
chuck
your
reason
overboard
you
may
just
as
well
be
catholic
as
protestant
nothing
can
be
more
ridiculous
than
the
protestant
objection
on
the
ground
of
absurdity
to
the
story
of
the
saint
walking
about
with
his
head
under
his
the
tea
things
had
been
cleared
away
and
marshall
was
smoking
both
he
and
dennis
were
chartists
and
baruch
had
interrupted
a
debate
upon
a
speech
delivered
at
a
chartist
meeting
that
morning
by
henry
vincent
frederick
dennis
was
about
thirty
tall
and
rather
he
wore
loose
clothes
his
was
tied
in
a
big
loose
knot
his
feet
were
large
and
his
boots
were
heavy
his
face
was
quite
smooth
and
his
hair
which
was
very
thick
and
light
brown
fell
across
his
forehead
in
a
heavy
wave
with
just
two
complete
undulations
in
it
from
the
parting
at
the
side
to
the
opposite
ear
it
had
a
trick
of
tumbling
over
his
eyes
so
that
his
fingers
were
continually
passed
through
it
to
brush
it
away
he
was
a
wood
engraver
or
as
he
preferred
to
call
himself
an
artist
but
he
also
wrote
for
the
newspapers
and
had
been
a
contributor
to
the
he
was
well
brought
up
and
was
intended
for
the
university
but
he
did
not
stick
to
his
latin
and
greek
and
as
he
showed
some
talent
for
drawing
he
was
permitted
to
follow
his
bent
his
work
however
was
not
of
quality
and
consequently
orders
were
not
abundant
this
was
the
reason
why
he
had
turned
to
literature
when
he
had
any
books
to
illustrate
he
lived
upon
what
they
brought
him
and
when
there
were
no
books
he
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
politics
if
books
and
newspapers
both
failed
he
subsisted
on
a
little
money
which
had
been
left
him
stayed
with
friends
as
long
as
he
could
and
amused
himself
by
writing
verses
which
showed
much
command
over
rhyme
i
can
not
stand
vincent
said
marshall
he
is
too
flowery
for
me
and
he
does
not
belong
to
the
people
he
is
to
the
he
is
deficient
in
ideas
said
dennis
it
is
odd
continued
marshall
turning
to
cohen
that
your
race
never
takes
any
interest
in
my
race
is
not
a
nation
or
if
a
nation
has
no
national
home
it
took
an
interest
in
politics
when
it
was
in
its
own
country
and
produced
some
rather
remarkable
political
but
why
do
you
care
so
little
for
what
is
going
on
now
i
do
care
but
all
people
are
not
born
to
be
agitators
and
furthermore
i
have
doubts
if
the
charter
will
accomplish
all
you
i
know
what
is
coming
took
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
spoke
with
perceptible
the
inefficiency
of
merely
external
remedies
the
folly
of
any
attempt
at
improvement
which
does
not
begin
with
the
improvement
of
individual
character
and
that
those
to
whom
we
intend
to
give
power
are
no
better
than
those
from
whom
we
intend
to
take
it
away
all
very
well
mr
cohen
my
answer
is
that
at
the
present
moment
the
stockingers
in
leicester
are
earning
four
shillings
and
sixpence
a
week
it
is
not
a
question
whether
they
are
better
or
worse
than
their
rulers
they
want
something
to
eat
they
have
nothing
and
their
masters
have
more
than
they
can
apart
altogether
from
purely
material
reasons
said
dennis
we
have
rights
we
are
born
into
this
planet
without
our
consent
and
therefore
we
may
make
certain
do
you
not
think
said
clara
that
the
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
will
help
you
dennis
smiled
and
was
about
to
reply
but
marshall
broke
out
savagely
repeal
of
the
corn
laws
is
a
contemptible
device
of
manufacturing
selfishness
it
means
low
wages
do
you
suppose
the
great
manchester
cotton
lords
care
one
straw
for
their
hands
not
they
they
will
face
a
revolution
for
repeal
because
it
will
enable
them
to
grind
an
extra
profit
out
of
i
agree
with
you
entirely
said
dennis
turning
to
clara
that
a
tax
upon
food
is
wrong
it
is
wrong
in
the
abstract
the
notion
of
taxing
bread
the
fruit
of
the
earth
is
most
repulsive
but
the
point
is
our
policy
to
be
if
a
certain
end
is
to
be
achieved
we
must
neglect
subordinate
ends
and
at
times
even
contradict
what
our
own
principles
would
appear
to
dictate
that
is
the
secret
of
successful
he
took
up
the
poker
and
stirred
the
fire
that
will
do
dennis
said
marshall
who
was
evidently
fidgety
the
room
is
rather
warm
there
s
nothing
in
vincent
which
irritates
me
more
than
those
bits
of
poetry
with
which
he
winds
up
god
made
the
made
the
slave
and
all
that
stuff
if
god
made
the
man
god
made
the
slave
i
know
what
vincent
s
little
game
is
and
it
is
the
same
game
with
all
his
set
they
want
to
keep
chartism
religious
but
we
shall
see
let
us
once
get
the
six
points
and
the
established
church
will
go
and
we
shall
have
secular
education
and
in
a
generation
there
will
not
be
one
superstition
theological
superstition
you
mean
said
clara
yes
of
course
what
others
are
there
worth
notice
a
few
the
superstition
of
the
ordinary
newspaper
reader
is
just
as
profound
and
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
may
be
just
as
injurious
as
the
superstition
of
a
spanish
peasant
or
the
tyranny
of
the
newspapers
will
not
burn
people
as
the
priests
did
and
would
do
again
if
they
had
the
power
and
they
do
not
insult
us
with
fables
and
a
hell
and
a
i
maintain
said
clara
with
emphasis
that
if
a
man
declines
to
examine
and
takes
for
granted
what
a
party
leader
or
a
newspaper
tells
him
he
has
no
case
against
the
man
who
declines
to
examine
or
takes
for
granted
what
the
priest
tells
him
besides
although
as
you
know
i
am
not
a
convert
myself
i
do
lose
a
little
patience
when
i
hear
it
preached
as
a
gospel
to
every
poor
conceited
creature
who
goes
to
your
sunday
evening
atheist
lecture
that
he
is
to
believe
nothing
on
one
particular
subject
which
his
own
precious
intellect
can
not
verify
and
the
next
morning
he
finds
it
to
be
his
duty
to
swallow
wholesale
anything
you
please
to
put
into
his
mouth
as
to
the
tyranny
the
day
may
come
and
i
believe
is
approaching
when
the
majority
will
be
found
to
be
more
dangerous
than
any
ecclesiastical
establishment
which
ever
baruch
s
lips
moved
but
he
was
silent
he
was
not
strong
in
argument
he
was
thinking
about
marshall
s
triumphant
inquiry
whether
god
is
not
responsible
for
slavery
he
would
have
liked
to
say
something
on
that
subject
but
he
had
nothing
ready
practical
people
said
dennis
who
had
not
quite
recovered
from
the
rebuke
as
to
the
warmth
of
the
room
are
often
most
unpractical
and
injudicious
nothing
can
be
more
unwise
than
to
mix
up
politics
and
religion
if
you
dennis
waved
his
hand
you
will
have
all
the
religious
people
against
you
my
friend
marshall
miss
hopgood
is
under
the
illusion
that
the
church
in
this
country
is
tottering
to
its
fall
now
although
i
myself
belong
to
no
sect
i
do
not
share
his
illusion
nay
more
i
am
not
sure
dennis
spoke
slowly
rubbed
his
chin
and
looked
up
at
the
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
not
something
to
be
said
in
favour
of
state
least
in
a
country
like
come
along
dennis
we
shall
be
late
said
marshall
and
the
two
forthwith
took
their
departure
in
order
to
attend
another
meeting
much
either
of
em
knows
about
it
said
mrs
caffyn
when
they
had
gone
there
s
marshall
getting
two
pounds
a
week
reg
lar
and
goes
on
talking
about
people
at
leicester
and
he
has
never
been
in
leicester
in
his
life
and
as
for
that
dennis
he
knows
less
than
marshall
for
he
does
nothing
but
write
for
newspapers
and
draw
for
never
nothing
what
you
may
call
work
and
he
does
worrit
me
so
whenever
he
begins
about
poor
people
that
i
can
t
sit
still
do
know
what
the
poor
is
having
lived
at
great
oakhurst
all
these
you
are
not
a
chartist
then
said
baruch
a
chartist
no
i
ain
t
and
yet
maybe
i
m
something
worse
what
would
be
the
use
of
giving
them
poor
creatures
votes
why
there
isn
t
one
of
them
as
wouldn
t
hold
up
his
hand
for
anybody
as
would
give
him
a
shilling
quite
right
of
em
too
for
the
one
thing
they
have
to
think
about
from
morning
to
night
is
how
to
get
a
bit
of
something
to
fill
their
bellies
and
they
won
t
fill
them
by
but
what
would
you
do
for
them
ah
that
beats
me
hang
somebody
but
i
don
t
know
who
it
ought
to
be
there
s
a
family
by
the
name
of
longwood
they
live
just
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
nigh
the
dower
farm
and
there
s
nine
of
them
and
the
youngest
when
i
left
was
a
baby
six
months
old
and
their
faces
the
road
so
that
the
north
wind
blows
in
right
under
the
door
and
i
ve
seen
the
snow
lie
in
heaps
inside
as
reg
lar
as
winter
comes
longwood
is
knocked
work
i
ve
knowed
them
not
have
a
bit
of
meat
for
weeks
together
and
him
about
at
the
corner
of
the
street
wasn
t
that
enough
to
make
him
feel
as
if
somebody
ought
to
be
killed
and
marshall
and
dennis
say
as
the
proper
thing
to
do
is
to
give
him
a
vote
and
prove
to
him
there
was
never
no
abraham
nor
isaac
and
that
jonah
never
was
in
a
whale
s
belly
and
that
nobody
had
no
business
to
have
more
children
than
he
could
feed
and
what
goes
on
and
what
must
go
on
inside
such
a
place
as
longwood
s
with
him
and
his
wife
and
with
them
boys
and
gals
all
huddled
i
d
better
hold
my
tongue
we
ll
let
the
smoke
out
of
this
room
i
think
and
air
it
a
she
opened
the
window
and
baruch
rose
and
went
home
whenever
mrs
caffyn
talked
about
the
labourers
at
great
oakhurst
whom
she
knew
so
well
clara
always
felt
as
if
all
her
reading
had
been
a
farce
and
indeed
if
we
come
into
close
contact
with
actual
life
art
poetry
and
philosophy
seem
little
better
than
trifling
when
the
mist
hangs
over
the
heavy
clay
land
in
january
and
men
and
women
shiver
in
the
bitter
cold
and
eat
raw
turnips
to
indulge
in
fireside
ecstasies
over
the
divine
plato
or
shakespeare
is
surely
not
such
a
virtue
as
we
imagine
it
to
be
chapter
xxvii
baruch
sat
and
mused
before
he
went
to
bed
he
had
gone
out
stirred
by
an
idea
but
it
was
already
dead
then
he
began
to
think
about
clara
who
was
this
dennis
who
visited
the
marshalls
and
the
hopgoods
oh
for
an
hour
of
his
youth
fifteen
years
ago
the
word
would
have
come
unbidden
if
he
had
seen
clara
but
now
in
place
of
the
word
there
was
hesitation
shame
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
renounce
for
ever
but
although
this
conclusion
had
forced
itself
upon
him
overnight
as
inevitable
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
when
he
rose
the
next
morning
of
plotting
to
meet
clara
and
he
walked
up
and
down
the
street
opposite
the
shop
door
that
evening
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
just
before
closing
time
hoping
that
she
might
come
out
and
that
he
might
have
the
opportunity
of
overtaking
her
apparently
by
accident
at
last
fearing
he
might
miss
her
he
went
in
and
found
she
had
a
companion
whom
he
instantly
knew
before
any
induction
to
be
her
sister
madge
was
not
now
the
madge
whom
we
knew
at
fenmarket
she
was
thinner
in
the
face
and
paler
nevertheless
she
was
not
careless
she
was
even
more
particular
in
her
costume
but
it
was
simpler
if
anything
perhaps
she
was
a
little
prouder
she
was
more
attractive
certainly
than
she
had
ever
been
although
her
face
could
not
be
said
to
be
handsomer
the
slight
prominence
of
the
the
slight
hollow
underneath
the
loss
of
colour
were
perhaps
defects
but
they
said
something
which
had
a
meaning
in
it
superior
to
that
of
the
tint
of
the
peach
she
had
been
reading
a
book
while
clara
was
balancing
her
cash
and
she
attempted
to
replace
it
the
shelf
was
a
little
too
high
and
the
volume
fell
upon
the
ground
it
contained
shelley
s
of
have
you
read
shelley
said
baruch
every
i
was
much
do
you
read
him
now
not
much
i
was
an
enthusiast
for
him
when
i
was
nineteen
but
i
find
that
his
subject
matter
is
rather
thin
and
his
themes
are
a
little
worn
he
was
entirely
enslaved
by
the
ideals
of
the
french
revolution
take
away
what
the
french
revolution
contributed
to
his
poetry
and
there
is
not
much
as
a
man
he
is
not
very
attractive
to
nor
to
me
i
never
shall
forgive
his
treatment
of
i
suppose
he
had
ceased
to
love
her
and
he
thought
therefore
he
was
justified
in
leaving
madge
turned
and
fixed
her
eyes
unobserved
on
baruch
he
was
looking
straight
at
the
bookshelves
there
was
not
and
indeed
how
could
there
be
any
reference
to
herself
i
should
put
it
in
this
way
she
said
that
he
thought
he
was
justified
in
sacrificing
a
woman
for
the
sake
of
an
call
this
a
defect
or
a
you
is
repellent
to
me
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
to
know
that
he
believed
the
impulse
to
be
i
wish
interrupted
clara
you
two
would
choose
less
exciting
subjects
of
conversation
my
totals
will
not
come
they
were
silent
and
baruch
affecting
to
study
a
rollin
s
wondered
especially
when
he
called
to
mind
mrs
caffyn
s
report
what
this
girl
s
history
could
have
been
he
presently
recovered
himself
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
ought
to
give
some
reason
why
he
had
called
before
however
he
was
able
to
offer
any
excuse
clara
closed
her
book
now
it
is
right
she
said
and
i
am
just
at
that
moment
barnes
appeared
hot
with
hurrying
very
sorry
miss
hopgood
to
ask
you
to
stay
for
a
few
minutes
i
recollected
after
i
left
that
the
doctor
particularly
wanted
those
books
sent
off
i
should
not
like
to
disappoint
him
i
have
been
to
the
and
the
van
will
be
here
in
about
twenty
minutes
if
you
will
make
out
the
invoice
and
check
me
i
will
pack
i
will
be
off
said
madge
the
shop
will
be
shut
if
i
do
not
make
you
are
not
going
alone
are
you
said
baruch
may
i
not
go
with
you
and
can
not
we
both
come
back
for
your
sister
it
is
very
kind
of
clara
looked
up
from
her
desk
watched
them
as
they
went
out
at
the
door
and
for
a
moment
seemed
lost
barnes
turned
round
now
miss
she
started
yes
ecclesiastica
in
qua
i
need
not
put
in
the
last
three
yes
barnes
never
liked
to
be
corrected
in
a
title
there
s
another
or
go
opera
ad
mss
clara
silently
made
the
entries
a
little
more
scholarly
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
parcel
was
ready
and
cohen
returned
your
sister
would
not
allow
me
to
wait
she
met
mrs
marshall
they
said
they
should
have
something
to
carry
and
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
bring
it
here
i
will
walk
with
you
if
you
will
allow
me
we
may
as
well
avoid
they
turned
into
gray
s
inn
and
when
they
were
in
comparative
quietude
he
said
any
chartist
news
and
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
by
the
way
who
is
your
friend
dennis
he
is
no
particular
friend
of
mine
he
is
a
and
writes
also
i
believe
for
the
he
can
talk
as
well
as
yes
he
can
talk
very
do
you
not
think
there
was
something
unreal
about
what
he
said
i
do
not
believe
he
is
actually
insincere
i
have
noticed
that
men
who
write
or
read
much
often
appear
somewhat
how
do
you
account
for
it
what
they
say
is
not
i
do
not
quite
understand
a
man
may
think
much
which
can
never
become
an
experience
in
your
sense
of
the
word
and
be
very
much
in
earnest
with
what
he
thinks
the
thinking
is
an
yes
i
suppose
so
but
it
is
what
a
person
has
gone
through
which
i
like
to
hear
poor
dennis
has
suffered
much
you
are
perhaps
surprised
but
it
is
true
and
when
he
leaves
politics
alone
he
is
a
different
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
very
uninteresting
to
you
i
did
not
mean
that
i
care
for
nothing
but
my
friend
s
aches
and
pains
but
that
i
do
not
care
for
what
he
just
takes
up
and
takes
it
is
my
misfortune
that
my
subjects
are
not
was
about
to
perhaps
it
is
because
i
am
a
i
do
not
know
quite
what
you
mean
by
your
subjects
but
if
you
mean
philosophy
and
religion
they
are
if
they
are
very
few
people
like
to
hear
anything
about
them
do
you
know
miss
hopgood
i
can
never
talk
to
anybody
as
i
can
to
clara
made
no
reply
a
husband
was
to
be
had
for
a
look
for
a
touch
a
husband
whom
she
could
love
a
husband
who
could
give
her
all
her
intellect
demanded
a
little
house
rose
before
her
eyes
as
if
by
arabian
enchantment
there
was
a
bright
fire
on
the
hearth
and
there
were
children
round
it
without
the
look
the
touch
there
would
be
solitude
silence
and
a
childless
old
age
so
much
more
to
be
feared
by
a
woman
than
by
a
man
baruch
paused
waiting
for
her
answer
and
her
tongue
actually
began
to
move
with
a
reply
which
would
have
sent
his
arm
round
her
and
made
them
one
for
ever
but
it
did
not
come
something
fell
and
flashed
before
her
like
lightning
from
a
cloud
overhead
divinely
beautiful
but
divinely
terrible
i
remember
she
said
that
i
have
to
call
in
lamb
s
conduit
street
to
buy
something
for
my
sister
i
shall
just
be
in
baruch
went
as
far
as
lamb
s
conduit
street
with
her
he
too
would
have
determined
his
own
destiny
if
she
had
uttered
the
word
but
the
power
to
proceed
without
it
was
wanting
and
he
fell
back
he
left
her
at
the
door
of
the
shop
she
bid
him
obviously
intending
that
he
should
go
no
further
with
her
and
he
shook
hands
with
her
taking
her
hand
again
and
shaking
it
again
with
a
grasp
which
she
knew
well
enough
was
too
fervent
for
mere
friendship
he
then
wandered
back
once
more
to
his
old
room
at
clerkenwell
the
fire
was
dead
he
stirred
it
the
cinders
fell
through
the
grate
and
it
dropped
out
all
together
he
made
no
attempt
to
rekindle
it
but
sat
staring
at
the
black
ashes
not
thinking
but
dreaming
thirty
years
more
perhaps
with
no
change
the
last
chance
that
he
could
begin
a
new
life
had
disappeared
he
cursed
himself
that
nothing
drove
him
out
of
himself
with
marshall
and
his
fellowmen
that
he
was
not
chartist
nor
revolutionary
but
it
was
impossible
to
create
in
himself
enthusiasm
for
a
cause
he
had
tried
before
to
become
a
patriot
and
had
failed
and
was
conscious
during
the
trial
that
he
was
pretending
to
be
something
he
was
not
and
could
not
be
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
pace
the
straight
road
in
front
of
him
which
led
nowhere
so
far
as
he
could
see
chapter
xxviii
a
month
afterwards
marshall
announced
that
he
intended
to
pay
a
visit
i
am
going
he
said
to
see
mazzini
who
will
go
with
me
clara
and
madge
were
both
eager
to
accompany
him
mrs
caffyn
and
mrs
marshall
chose
to
stay
at
home
i
shall
ask
cohen
to
come
with
us
said
marshall
he
has
never
seen
mazzini
and
would
like
to
know
cohen
accordingly
called
one
sunday
evening
and
the
party
went
together
to
a
dull
dark
little
house
in
a
shabby
street
of
small
shops
and
furnished
apartments
when
they
knocked
at
mazzini
s
door
marshall
asked
for
mr
for
even
in
england
mazzini
had
an
assumed
name
which
was
always
used
when
inquiries
were
made
for
him
they
were
shown
upstairs
into
a
rather
mean
room
and
found
there
a
man
really
about
forty
but
looking
older
he
had
dark
hair
growing
away
from
his
forehead
dark
moustache
dark
beard
and
a
singularly
serious
face
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
conspirator
but
that
of
a
saint
although
without
that
just
perceptible
touch
of
silliness
which
spoils
the
faces
of
most
saints
it
was
the
face
of
a
saint
of
the
reason
of
a
man
who
could
be
ecstatic
for
rational
ideals
rarest
of
all
endowments
it
was
the
face
too
of
one
who
knew
no
fear
or
if
he
knew
it
could
crush
it
he
was
once
concealed
by
a
poor
woman
whose
house
was
surrounded
by
austrian
soldiers
watching
for
him
he
was
determined
that
she
should
not
be
sacrificed
and
having
disguised
himself
a
little
walked
out
into
the
street
in
broad
daylight
went
up
to
the
austrian
sentry
asked
for
a
light
for
his
cigar
and
escaped
he
was
cordial
in
his
reception
of
his
visitors
particularly
of
clara
madge
and
cohen
whom
he
had
not
seen
before
the
english
he
said
after
some
preliminary
conversation
are
a
curious
people
as
a
nation
they
are
what
they
call
practical
and
have
a
contempt
for
ideas
but
i
have
known
some
englishmen
who
have
a
religious
belief
in
them
a
nobler
belief
than
i
have
found
in
any
other
nation
there
are
english
women
also
who
have
this
faith
and
one
or
two
are
amongst
my
dearest
i
never
said
marshall
quite
comprehend
you
on
this
point
i
should
say
that
we
know
as
clearly
as
most
folk
what
we
want
and
we
mean
to
have
that
may
be
but
it
is
not
justice
as
justice
which
inspires
you
those
of
you
who
have
not
enough
desire
to
have
more
that
is
if
we
are
to
succeed
we
must
preach
what
the
people
pardon
me
that
is
just
where
you
and
i
differ
whenever
any
real
good
is
done
it
is
by
a
crusade
that
is
to
say
the
cross
must
be
raised
and
appeal
be
made
to
something
the
people
no
system
based
on
rights
will
stand
never
will
society
be
permanent
till
it
is
founded
on
duty
if
we
consider
our
rights
exclusively
we
extend
them
over
the
rights
of
our
neighbours
if
the
oppressed
classes
had
the
power
to
obtain
their
rights
and
with
the
rights
came
no
deeper
sense
of
duty
the
new
order
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
oppressed
are
no
better
than
their
oppressors
would
be
just
as
unstable
as
that
which
preceded
to
put
it
in
my
own
language
said
madge
you
believe
in
mazzini
leaned
forward
and
looked
earnestly
at
her
my
dear
young
friend
without
that
belief
i
should
have
no
i
should
like
though
said
marshall
to
see
the
church
which
would
acknowledge
you
and
miss
madge
or
would
admit
your
god
to
be
what
is
essential
replied
madge
in
a
belief
in
god
is
absolute
loyalty
to
a
principle
we
know
to
have
it
may
perhaps
said
mazzini
be
more
to
me
but
you
are
right
it
is
a
belief
in
the
supremacy
and
ultimate
victory
of
the
the
victory
seems
distant
in
italy
now
said
baruch
i
do
not
mean
the
millennial
victory
of
which
you
speak
but
an
approximation
to
it
by
the
overthrow
of
tyranny
you
are
mistaken
it
is
far
nearer
than
you
do
you
obtain
said
clara
any
real
help
from
people
here
do
you
not
find
that
they
merely
talk
and
express
what
they
call
their
sympathy
i
must
not
say
what
help
i
have
received
more
than
words
though
from
you
expect
then
said
baruch
that
the
italians
will
answer
your
appeal
if
i
had
no
faith
in
the
people
i
do
not
see
what
faith
could
the
people
are
the
persons
you
meet
in
the
a
people
is
not
a
mere
assemblage
of
uninteresting
units
but
it
is
not
a
phantom
a
spirit
lives
in
each
nation
which
is
superior
to
any
individual
in
it
it
is
this
which
is
the
true
reality
the
nation
s
purpose
and
destiny
it
is
this
for
which
the
patriot
lives
and
i
suppose
said
clara
you
have
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
volunteers
for
any
dangerous
enterprise
none
you
would
be
amazed
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
many
men
and
women
at
this
very
moment
would
go
to
meet
certain
death
if
i
were
to
ask
women
oh
yes
and
women
are
of
the
greatest
use
but
it
is
rather
difficult
to
find
those
who
have
the
necessary
i
suppose
you
employ
them
in
order
to
obtain
secret
information
yes
amongst
the
the
party
broke
up
baruch
manœuvred
to
walk
with
clara
but
marshall
wanted
to
borrow
a
book
from
mazzini
and
she
stayed
behind
for
him
madge
was
outside
in
the
street
and
baruch
could
do
nothing
but
go
to
her
she
seemed
unwilling
to
wait
and
baruch
and
she
went
slowly
homewards
thinking
the
others
would
overtake
them
the
conversation
naturally
turned
upon
mazzini
although
said
madge
i
have
never
seen
him
before
i
have
heard
much
about
him
and
he
makes
me
why
because
he
has
done
something
worth
doing
and
will
do
but
why
should
that
make
you
sad
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
sadder
than
to
know
you
are
able
to
do
a
little
good
and
would
like
to
do
it
and
yet
you
are
not
permitted
to
do
it
mazzini
has
a
world
open
to
him
large
enough
for
the
exercise
of
all
his
it
is
worse
to
have
a
desire
which
is
intense
but
not
definite
to
be
continually
anxious
to
do
something
you
know
not
what
and
always
to
feel
if
any
distinct
task
is
offered
your
incapability
of
attempting
a
man
if
he
has
a
real
desire
to
be
of
any
service
can
generally
gratify
it
to
some
extent
a
woman
as
a
rule
can
not
although
a
woman
s
enthusiasm
is
deeper
than
a
man
s
you
can
join
mazzini
i
suppose
if
you
it
is
a
supposition
not
quite
justifiable
and
if
i
were
free
to
go
i
could
why
i
am
not
fitted
for
such
work
i
have
not
sufficient
faith
when
i
see
a
flag
waving
a
doubt
always
intrudes
long
ago
i
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
i
should
have
to
be
content
with
a
life
which
did
not
extend
outside
i
am
sure
that
many
women
blunder
into
the
wrong
path
not
because
they
are
bad
but
simply
i
may
say
are
too
maybe
you
are
right
the
inability
to
obtain
mere
pleasure
has
not
produced
the
misery
which
has
been
begotten
of
mistaken
or
baffled
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
would
like
to
enlist
under
mazzini
no
baruch
thought
she
referred
to
her
child
and
he
was
silent
you
are
a
philosopher
said
madge
after
a
pause
have
you
never
discovered
anything
which
will
enable
us
to
submit
to
be
useless
that
is
to
say
have
i
discovered
a
religion
for
the
core
of
religion
is
the
relationship
of
the
individual
to
the
whole
the
faith
that
the
poorest
and
meanest
of
us
is
a
person
that
is
the
real
strength
of
all
well
go
on
what
do
you
believe
i
can
only
say
it
like
a
creed
i
have
no
demonstration
at
least
none
such
as
i
would
venture
to
put
into
words
perhaps
the
highest
of
all
truths
is
incapable
of
demonstration
and
can
only
be
stated
perhaps
also
the
statement
at
least
to
some
of
us
is
a
sufficient
demonstration
i
believe
that
inability
to
imagine
a
thing
is
not
a
reason
for
its
if
the
infinite
is
a
conclusion
which
is
forced
upon
me
the
fact
that
i
can
not
picture
it
does
not
disprove
it
i
believe
also
in
thought
and
the
soul
and
it
is
nothing
to
me
that
i
can
not
explain
them
by
attributes
belonging
to
body
that
being
so
the
difficulties
which
arise
from
the
perpetual
and
unconscious
confusion
of
the
qualities
of
thought
and
soul
with
those
of
body
disappear
our
imagination
represents
to
itself
souls
like
pebbles
and
asks
itself
what
count
can
be
kept
of
a
million
but
number
in
such
a
case
is
inapplicable
i
believe
that
all
thought
is
a
manifestation
of
the
being
who
is
one
whom
you
may
call
god
if
you
like
and
that
as
it
never
was
created
it
will
never
be
but
said
madge
interrupting
him
although
you
began
by
warning
me
not
to
expect
that
you
would
prove
anything
you
can
tell
me
whether
you
have
any
kind
of
basis
for
what
you
say
or
whether
it
is
all
a
you
will
be
surprised
perhaps
to
hear
that
mathematics
which
of
course
i
had
to
learn
for
my
own
business
have
supplied
something
for
a
foundation
they
lead
to
ideas
which
are
inconsistent
with
the
notion
that
the
imagination
is
a
measure
of
all
things
mind
i
do
not
for
a
moment
pretend
that
i
have
any
theory
which
explains
the
universe
it
is
something
however
to
know
that
the
sky
is
as
real
as
the
they
had
now
reached
great
ormond
street
and
parted
clara
and
marshall
were
about
five
minutes
behind
them
madge
was
unusually
cheerful
when
they
sat
down
to
supper
clara
she
said
what
made
you
so
silent
at
mazzini
s
clara
did
not
reply
but
after
a
pause
of
a
minute
or
two
she
asked
mrs
caffyn
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
for
them
all
to
go
into
the
country
on
whitmonday
whitsuntide
was
late
it
would
be
warm
and
they
could
take
their
food
with
them
and
eat
it
out
of
doors
just
the
very
thing
my
dear
if
we
could
get
anything
cheap
to
take
us
the
baby
of
course
must
go
with
us
i
should
like
above
everything
to
go
to
great
what
five
of
miles
there
and
twenty
miles
back
besides
although
i
love
the
place
it
isn
t
exactly
what
one
would
go
to
see
just
for
a
day
no
letherhead
or
mickleham
or
darkin
would
be
ever
so
much
better
they
are
too
far
though
and
then
that
man
baruch
must
go
with
us
he
d
be
company
for
marshall
and
he
sticks
up
in
clerkenwell
and
never
goes
nowhere
you
remember
as
marshall
said
as
he
must
ask
him
the
next
time
we
had
an
clara
had
not
forgotten
it
ah
continued
mrs
caffyn
i
should
just
love
to
show
you
mrs
caffyn
s
heart
yearned
after
her
surrey
land
the
man
who
is
born
in
a
town
does
not
know
what
it
is
to
be
haunted
through
life
by
lovely
visions
of
the
landscape
which
lay
about
him
when
he
was
young
the
village
youth
leaves
the
home
of
his
childhood
for
the
city
but
the
river
doubling
on
itself
the
overhanging
alders
and
willows
the
fringe
of
level
meadow
the
chalk
hills
bounding
the
river
valley
and
rising
against
the
sky
with
here
and
there
on
their
summits
solitary
clusters
of
beech
the
light
and
peace
of
the
different
seasons
of
morning
afternoon
and
evening
never
forsake
him
to
think
of
them
is
not
a
mere
luxury
their
presence
modifies
the
whole
of
his
life
i
don
t
see
how
it
is
to
be
managed
she
mused
and
yet
there
s
nothing
near
london
as
i
d
give
two
pins
to
see
there
s
richmond
as
we
went
to
one
sunday
it
was
no
better
to
my
way
of
thinking
than
looking
at
a
picture
i
d
ever
so
much
sooner
be
across
the
turnips
by
the
footpath
from
darkin
couldn
t
we
for
once
in
a
way
stay
somewhere
it
might
as
well
be
two
said
mrs
marshall
saturday
and
two
said
madge
i
vote
for
wait
a
bit
my
dears
we
re
a
precious
awkward
lot
to
fit
and
his
wife
me
and
you
and
miss
clara
and
the
baby
and
then
there
s
baruch
who
s
odd
man
so
to
speak
that
s
three
bedrooms
we
sha
n
t
do
i
was
what
were
you
thinking
said
marshall
i
ve
got
it
said
mrs
caffyn
joyously
miss
clara
and
me
will
go
to
great
oakhurst
on
the
friday
we
can
easy
enough
stay
at
my
old
shop
marshall
and
sarah
miss
madge
the
baby
and
baruch
can
go
to
letherhead
on
the
saturday
morning
the
two
women
and
the
baby
can
have
one
of
the
rooms
at
skelton
s
and
marshall
and
baruch
can
have
the
other
then
on
sunday
morning
miss
clara
and
me
we
ll
come
over
for
you
and
we
ll
all
walk
through
norbury
park
that
ll
be
ever
so
much
better
in
many
ways
miss
clara
and
me
we
ll
go
by
the
coach
six
of
us
not
reckoning
the
baby
in
that
heavy
cart
of
masterman
s
would
be
too
an
expensive
holiday
rather
said
marshall
leave
that
to
me
that
s
my
business
i
ain
t
quite
a
beggar
and
if
we
can
t
take
our
pleasure
once
a
year
it
s
a
pity
we
aren
t
like
some
folk
as
messes
about
up
to
hampstead
every
sunday
and
spends
a
fortune
on
shrimps
and
donkeys
no
when
i
go
away
it
away
maybe
it
s
only
for
a
couple
of
days
where
i
can
see
a
blessed
ploughed
field
no
shrimps
nor
donkeys
for
charter
xxix
so
it
was
settled
and
on
the
friday
clara
and
mrs
caffyn
journeyed
to
great
oakhurst
they
were
both
tired
and
went
to
bed
very
early
in
order
that
they
might
enjoy
the
next
day
clara
always
a
light
sleeper
woke
between
three
and
four
rose
and
went
to
the
little
casement
window
which
had
been
open
all
night
below
her
on
the
left
the
church
was
just
discernible
and
on
the
right
the
broad
chalk
uplands
leaned
to
the
south
and
were
waving
with
green
barley
and
wheat
underneath
her
lay
the
cottage
garden
with
its
row
of
beehives
in
the
corner
sheltered
from
the
cold
winds
by
the
thick
hedge
it
had
evidently
been
raining
a
little
for
the
drops
hung
on
the
currant
bushes
but
the
clouds
had
been
driven
by
the
wind
into
the
eastern
sky
where
they
lay
in
a
long
low
grey
band
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
save
every
now
and
then
the
crow
of
a
cock
or
the
short
cry
of
a
thrush
high
up
on
the
zenith
the
approach
of
the
sun
to
the
horizon
was
proclaimed
by
the
most
delicate
tints
of
but
the
above
him
was
dark
and
untouched
although
the
blue
which
was
over
it
was
every
moment
becoming
paler
clara
watched
she
was
moved
even
to
tears
by
the
beauty
of
the
scene
but
she
was
stirred
by
something
more
than
beauty
just
as
he
who
was
in
the
spirit
and
beheld
a
throne
and
one
sitting
thereon
saw
something
more
than
loveliness
although
he
was
radiant
with
the
colour
of
jasper
and
there
was
a
rainbow
round
about
him
like
an
emerald
to
look
upon
in
a
few
moments
the
highest
top
of
the
was
kindled
and
the
whole
wavy
outline
became
a
fringe
of
flame
in
a
few
moments
more
the
fire
just
at
one
point
became
blinding
and
in
another
second
the
sun
emerged
the
first
arrowy
shaft
passed
into
her
chamber
the
first
shadow
was
cast
and
it
was
day
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
the
tears
fell
faster
but
she
wiped
them
away
and
her
great
purpose
was
fixed
she
crept
back
into
bed
her
agitation
ceased
a
strange
and
almost
supernatural
peace
overshadowed
her
and
she
fell
asleep
not
to
wake
till
the
sound
of
the
scythe
had
ceased
in
the
meadow
just
beyond
the
that
came
up
to
one
side
of
the
cottage
and
the
mowers
were
at
their
breakfast
neither
mrs
caffyn
nor
clara
thought
of
seeing
the
letherhead
party
on
saturday
they
could
not
arrive
before
the
afternoon
and
it
was
considered
hardly
worth
while
to
walk
from
great
oakhurst
to
letherhead
merely
for
the
sake
of
an
hour
or
two
in
the
morning
mrs
caffyn
was
so
busy
with
her
old
friends
that
she
rather
tired
herself
and
in
the
evening
clara
went
for
a
stroll
she
did
not
know
the
country
but
she
wandered
on
until
she
came
to
a
lane
which
led
down
to
the
river
at
the
bottom
of
the
lane
she
found
herself
at
a
narrow
steep
stone
bridge
she
had
not
been
there
more
than
three
or
four
minutes
before
she
descried
two
persons
coming
down
the
lane
from
letherhead
when
they
were
about
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
from
her
they
turned
into
the
meadow
over
the
stile
and
struck
the
some
distance
below
the
point
where
she
was
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
them
they
were
madge
and
baruch
they
sauntered
leisurely
presently
baruch
knelt
down
over
the
water
apparently
to
gather
something
which
he
gave
to
madge
they
then
crossed
another
stile
and
were
lost
behind
the
tall
hedge
which
stopped
further
view
of
the
footpath
in
that
direction
the
message
then
was
authentic
she
said
to
herself
i
thought
i
could
not
have
misunderstood
on
sunday
morning
clara
wished
to
stay
at
home
she
pleaded
that
she
preferred
rest
but
mrs
caffyn
vowed
there
should
be
no
norbury
park
if
clara
did
not
go
and
the
kind
creature
managed
to
persuade
a
to
drive
them
over
to
letherhead
for
a
small
sum
notwithstanding
it
was
sunday
the
whole
party
then
set
out
the
baby
was
drawn
in
a
borrowed
carriage
which
also
took
the
provisions
and
they
were
fairly
out
of
the
town
before
the
letherhead
bells
had
ceased
ringing
for
church
it
was
one
of
the
sweetest
of
sundays
sunny
but
masses
of
white
clouds
now
and
then
broke
the
heat
the
park
was
reached
early
in
the
forenoon
and
it
was
agreed
that
dinner
should
be
served
under
one
of
the
huge
beech
trees
at
the
lower
end
as
the
hill
was
a
little
too
steep
for
the
in
the
hot
sun
this
is
very
beautiful
said
marshall
when
dinner
was
over
but
it
is
not
what
we
came
to
see
we
ought
to
move
upwards
to
the
druid
s
yes
you
be
off
the
whole
lot
of
you
said
mrs
caffyn
i
know
every
tree
there
and
i
ain
t
going
there
this
afternoon
somebody
must
stay
here
to
look
after
the
baby
you
can
t
wheel
her
you
ll
have
to
carry
her
and
you
won
t
enjoy
yourselves
much
more
for
moiling
along
with
her
up
that
i
will
stay
with
you
said
clara
everybody
protested
but
clara
was
firm
she
was
tired
and
the
sun
had
given
her
a
headache
madge
pleaded
that
it
was
she
who
ought
to
remain
behind
but
at
last
gave
way
for
her
sister
looked
really
fatigued
there
s
a
dear
child
said
clara
when
madge
consented
to
go
i
shall
lie
on
the
grass
and
perhaps
go
to
it
is
a
pity
said
baruch
to
madge
as
they
went
away
that
we
are
separated
we
must
come
yes
i
am
sorry
but
perhaps
it
is
better
she
should
be
where
she
is
she
is
not
particularly
strong
and
is
obliged
to
be
very
in
due
time
they
all
came
to
the
famous
yews
and
sat
down
on
one
of
the
seats
overlooking
that
wonderful
gate
in
the
chalk
downs
through
which
the
mole
passes
northwards
we
must
go
said
marshall
a
little
bit
further
and
see
the
not
another
step
said
his
wife
you
can
go
it
you
content
nothing
could
be
pleasanter
than
to
sit
here
and
he
pulled
out
his
pipe
but
really
miss
madge
to
leave
norbury
without
paying
a
visit
to
the
oak
is
a
he
did
not
offer
however
to
accompany
her
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
tree
in
these
parts
said
baruch
of
incalculable
age
and
with
branches
spreading
into
a
tent
big
enough
to
cover
a
regiment
marshall
is
quite
where
is
it
not
above
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
further
just
round
the
madge
rose
and
looked
no
it
is
not
visible
here
it
stands
a
little
way
back
if
you
come
a
little
further
you
will
catch
a
glimpse
of
she
followed
him
and
presently
the
oak
came
in
view
they
climbed
up
the
bank
and
went
nearer
to
it
the
whole
vale
was
underneath
them
and
part
of
the
weald
with
the
sussex
downs
blue
in
the
distance
baruch
was
not
much
given
to
raptures
over
scenery
but
the
indifference
of
nature
to
the
world
s
turmoil
always
appealed
to
him
you
are
not
now
discontented
because
you
can
not
serve
under
mazzini
not
there
was
nothing
in
her
reply
on
the
face
of
it
of
any
particular
consequence
to
baruch
she
might
simply
have
intended
that
the
beauty
of
the
fair
landscape
extinguished
her
restlessness
or
that
she
saw
her
own
unfitness
but
neither
of
these
interpretations
presented
itself
to
him
i
have
sometimes
thought
continued
baruch
slowly
that
the
love
of
any
two
persons
in
this
world
may
fulfil
an
eternal
purpose
which
is
as
necessary
to
the
universe
as
a
great
madge
s
eyes
moved
round
from
the
hills
and
they
met
baruch
s
no
syllable
was
uttered
but
swiftest
messages
passed
question
and
answer
there
was
no
hesitation
on
his
part
now
no
doubt
the
woman
and
the
moment
had
come
the
last
question
was
put
the
final
answer
was
given
he
took
her
hand
in
his
and
came
closer
to
her
stop
she
whispered
do
you
know
my
history
he
did
not
reply
but
fell
upon
her
neck
this
was
the
goal
to
which
both
had
been
journeying
all
these
years
although
with
much
weary
mistaking
of
roads
this
was
what
from
the
beginning
was
designed
for
both
happy
madge
happy
baruch
there
are
some
so
closely
akin
that
the
meaning
of
each
may
be
said
to
lie
in
the
other
who
do
not
approach
till
it
is
too
late
they
travel
towards
one
another
but
are
waylaid
and
detained
and
just
as
they
are
within
greeting
one
of
them
drops
and
dies
they
left
the
tree
and
went
back
to
the
marshalls
and
then
down
the
hill
to
mrs
caffyn
and
clara
clara
was
much
better
for
her
rest
and
early
in
the
evening
the
whole
party
returned
to
letherhead
clara
and
mrs
caffyn
going
on
to
great
oakhurst
madge
kept
close
to
her
sister
till
they
separated
and
the
two
men
walked
together
on
whitmonday
morning
the
letherhead
people
came
over
to
great
oakhurst
they
had
to
go
back
to
london
in
the
afternoon
but
mrs
caffyn
and
clara
were
to
stay
till
tuesday
as
they
stood
a
better
chance
of
securing
places
by
the
coach
on
that
day
mrs
caffyn
had
as
much
to
show
them
as
if
the
village
had
been
the
tower
of
london
the
wonder
of
wonders
however
was
a
big
house
where
she
was
well
known
and
its
madge
wanted
to
speak
to
clara
but
it
was
difficult
to
find
a
private
opportunity
when
they
were
in
the
garden
however
she
managed
to
take
clara
unobserved
down
one
of
the
twisted
paths
under
pretence
of
admiring
an
ancient
mulberry
tree
clara
she
said
i
want
a
word
with
you
baruch
cohen
loves
do
you
love
him
without
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
without
a
shadow
of
a
clara
put
her
arm
round
her
sister
kissed
her
tenderly
and
said
then
i
am
perfectly
did
you
suspect
it
i
knew
mrs
caffyn
called
them
it
was
time
to
be
moving
and
soon
afterwards
those
who
had
to
go
to
london
that
afternoon
left
for
letherhead
clara
stood
at
the
gate
for
a
long
time
watching
them
along
the
straight
white
road
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
hill
she
could
just
discern
them
against
the
sky
they
passed
over
the
ridge
and
she
went
indoors
in
the
evening
a
friend
called
to
see
mrs
caffyn
and
clara
went
to
the
stone
bridge
which
she
had
visited
on
saturday
the
water
on
the
upper
side
of
the
bridge
was
dammed
up
and
fell
over
the
little
sluice
gates
under
the
arches
into
a
clear
and
deep
basin
about
forty
or
fifty
feet
in
diameter
the
river
for
some
reason
of
its
own
had
bitten
into
the
western
bank
and
had
scooped
out
a
great
piece
of
it
into
an
island
the
main
current
went
round
the
island
with
a
shallow
swift
ripple
instead
of
going
through
the
pool
as
it
might
have
done
for
there
was
a
clear
channel
for
it
the
centre
and
the
region
under
the
island
were
deep
and
still
but
at
the
farther
end
where
the
river
in
passing
called
to
the
pool
it
broke
into
waves
as
it
answered
the
appeal
and
added
its
own
contribution
to
the
stream
which
went
away
down
to
the
mill
and
onwards
to
the
big
thames
on
the
island
were
aspens
and
alders
the
floods
had
loosened
the
roots
of
the
largest
tree
and
it
hung
over
heavily
in
the
direction
in
which
it
had
yielded
to
the
rush
of
the
torrent
but
it
still
held
its
grip
and
the
sap
had
not
forsaken
a
single
branch
every
one
was
as
dense
with
foliage
as
if
there
had
been
no
struggle
for
life
and
the
leaves
sang
their
sweet
song
just
perceptible
for
a
moment
every
now
and
then
in
the
variations
of
the
louder
music
below
them
it
is
curious
that
the
sound
of
a
weir
is
never
uniform
but
is
perpetually
changing
in
the
ear
even
of
a
person
who
stands
close
by
it
one
of
the
arches
of
the
bridge
was
dry
and
clara
went
down
into
it
stood
at
the
edge
and
watched
that
wonderful
plunge
of
a
smooth
pure
stream
into
the
great
cup
which
it
has
hollowed
out
for
itself
down
it
went
with
a
dancing
foamy
fringe
playing
round
it
just
where
it
met
the
surface
a
dozen
yards
away
it
rose
again
bubbling
and
exultant
she
came
up
from
the
arch
and
went
home
as
the
sun
was
setting
she
found
mrs
caffyn
alone
i
have
news
to
tell
you
she
said
baruch
cohen
is
in
love
with
my
sister
and
she
is
in
love
with
the
lord
miss
clara
i
thought
sometimes
that
perhaps
it
might
be
you
but
there
it
s
better
maybe
as
it
is
for
what
why
my
dear
because
somebody
s
sure
to
turn
up
who
ll
make
you
happy
but
there
aren
t
many
men
like
baruch
you
see
what
i
mean
don
t
you
he
s
always
books
and
therefore
he
don
t
think
so
much
of
what
some
people
would
make
a
fuss
about
not
as
anything
of
that
kind
would
ever
stop
me
if
i
were
a
man
and
saw
such
a
woman
as
miss
madge
he
s
really
as
good
a
creature
as
ever
was
born
and
with
that
child
she
might
have
found
it
hard
to
get
along
and
now
it
will
be
cared
for
and
so
will
she
be
to
the
end
of
their
the
evening
after
their
return
to
great
ormond
street
mazzini
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
clara
alone
when
i
last
saw
you
she
said
you
told
us
that
you
had
been
helped
by
women
i
offer
but
my
dear
madam
you
hardly
know
what
the
qualifications
are
to
begin
with
there
must
be
a
knowledge
of
three
foreign
languages
french
german
and
italian
and
the
capacity
and
will
to
endure
great
privation
suffering
and
perhaps
i
was
educated
abroad
i
can
speak
german
and
french
i
do
not
know
much
italian
but
when
i
reach
italy
i
will
soon
pardon
me
for
asking
you
what
may
appear
a
rude
question
is
it
a
personal
disappointment
which
sends
you
to
me
or
love
for
the
cause
it
is
not
uncommon
to
find
that
young
women
when
earthly
love
is
impossible
attempt
to
satisfy
their
cravings
with
a
love
for
that
which
is
does
it
make
any
difference
so
far
as
their
constancy
is
concerned
i
can
not
say
that
it
does
the
devotion
of
many
of
the
martyrs
of
the
catholic
church
was
repulsion
from
the
world
as
much
as
attraction
to
heaven
you
must
understand
that
i
am
not
prompted
by
curiosity
if
you
are
to
be
my
friend
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
know
you
my
motive
is
perfectly
they
had
some
further
talk
and
parted
after
a
few
more
interviews
clara
and
another
english
lady
started
for
italy
madge
had
letters
from
her
sister
at
intervals
for
eighteen
months
the
last
being
from
venice
then
they
ceased
and
shortly
afterwards
mazzini
told
baruch
that
his
was
dead
all
efforts
to
obtain
more
information
from
mazzini
were
in
vain
but
one
day
when
her
name
was
mentioned
he
said
to
madge
the
theologians
represent
the
crucifixion
as
the
most
sublime
fact
in
the
world
s
history
it
was
sublime
but
let
us
reverence
also
the
eternal
christ
who
is
for
ever
being
crucified
for
our
father
said
a
younger
clara
to
baruch
some
ten
years
later
as
she
sat
on
his
knee
i
had
an
aunt
clara
once
hadn
t
i
yes
my
didn
t
she
go
to
italy
and
die
there
why
did
she
go
because
she
wanted
to
free
the
poor
people
of
italy
who
were
the
end
