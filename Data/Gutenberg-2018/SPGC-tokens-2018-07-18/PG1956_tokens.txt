and
even
now
by
max
beerbohm
to
my
wife
i
offer
here
some
of
the
essays
that
i
have
written
in
the
course
of
the
past
ten
years
while
i
was
collecting
them
and
quite
patiently
reading
them
again
i
found
that
a
few
of
them
were
in
direct
reference
to
the
moments
at
which
they
were
severally
composed
it
was
clear
that
these
must
have
their
dates
affixed
to
them
and
for
sake
of
uniformity
i
have
dated
all
the
others
and
doing
so
have
thought
i
need
not
exclude
all
such
topical
remarks
as
in
them
too
were
uttered
nor
throw
into
a
past
tense
such
of
those
remarks
as
i
have
retained
perhaps
a
book
of
essays
ought
to
seem
as
if
it
had
been
written
a
few
days
before
publication

the
other

a
relic
yesterday
i
found
in
a
cupboard
an
old
small
battered
portmanteau
which
by
the
initials
on
it
i
recognised
as
my
own
property
the
lock
appeared
to
have
been
forced
i
dimly
remembered
having
forced
it
myself
with
a
poker
in
my
hot
youth
after
some
journey
in
which
i
had
lost
the
key
and
this
act
of
violence
was
probably
the
reason
why
the
trunk
had
so
long
ago
ceased
to
travel
i
unstrapped
it
not
without
dust
it
exhaled
the
faint
scent
of
its
long
closure
it
contained
a
tweed
suit
of
late
victorian
pattern
some
bills
some
letters
a
and
something
which
after
i
had
wondered
for
a
moment
or
two
what
on
earth
it
was
caused
me
suddenly
to
murmur
down
below
the
sea
rustled
to
and
fro
over
the
strange
that
these
words
had
year
after
long
year
been
existing
in
some
obscure
cell
at
the
back
of
my
brain
forgotten
but
all
the
while
existing
like
the
trunk
in
that
cupboard
what
released
them
what
threw
open
the
cell
door
was
nothing
but
the
fragment
of
a
fan
just
the
of
an
inexpensive
fan
the
sticks
are
of
white
bone
clipped
together
with
a
semicircular
ring
that
is
not
silver
they
are
neatly
oval
at
the
base
but
variously
jagged
at
the
other
end
the
longest
of
them
measures
perhaps
two
inches
ring
and
all
they
have
no
market
value
for
a
farthing
is
the
least
coin
in
our
currency
and
yet
though
i
had
so
long
forgotten
them
for
me
they
are
not
worthless
they
touch
a
chord
lest
this
confession
raise
false
hopes
in
the
reader
i
add
that
i
did
not
know
their
owner
i
did
once
see
her
and
in
normandy
and
by
moonlight
and
her
name
was
ange
lique
she
was
graceful
she
was
even
beautiful
i
was
but
nineteen
years
old
yet
even
so
i
can
not
say
that
she
impressed
me
favourably
i
was
seated
at
a
table
of
a
cafe
on
the
terrace
of
a
casino
i
sat
facing
the
sea
with
my
back
to
the
casino
i
sat
listening
to
the
quiet
sea
which
i
had
crossed
that
morning
the
hour
was
late
there
were
few
people
about
i
heard
the
behind
me
flap
open
and
was
aware
of
a
sharp
snapping
and
crackling
sound
as
a
lady
in
white
passed
quickly
by
me
i
stared
at
her
erect
thin
back
and
her
agitated
elbows
a
short
fat
man
passed
in
pursuit
of
her
an
elderly
man
in
a
black
alpaca
jacket
that
billowed
i
saw
that
she
had
left
a
trail
of
little
white
things
on
the
asphalt
i
watched
the
efforts
of
the
agonised
short
fat
man
to
overtake
her
as
she
swept
away
to
the
distant
end
of
the
terrace
what
was
the
matter
what
had
made
her
so
spectacularly
angry
with
him
the
three
or
four
waiters
of
the
cafe
were
exchanging
cynical
smiles
and
shrugs
as
waiters
will
i
tried
to
feel
cynical
but
was
thrilled
with
excitement
with
wonder
and
curiosity
the
woman
out
yonder
had
doubled
on
her
tracks
she
had
not
slackened
her
furious
speed
but
the
man
waddlingly
contrived
to
keep
pace
with
her
now
with
every
moment
they
became
more
distinct
and
the
prospect
that
they
would
presently
pass
by
me
back
into
the
casino
gave
me
that
physical
tension
which
one
feels
on
a
wayside
platform
at
the
imminent
passing
of
an
express
in
the
rushingly
enlarged
vision
i
had
of
them
the
wrath
on
the
woman
s
face
was
even
more
saliently
the
main
thing
than
i
had
supposed
it
would
be
that
very
hard
parisian
face
must
have
been
as
white
as
the
powder
that
coated
it
coute
ange
lique
gasped
the
perspiring
bourgeois
écoute
je
te
supplie
the
received
them
and
was
left
swinging
to
and
fro
i
wanted
to
follow
but
had
not
paid
for
my
bock
i
beckoned
my
waiter
on
his
way
to
me
he
stooped
down
and
picked
up
something
which
with
a
smile
and
a
shrug
he
laid
on
my
table
il
semble
que
mademoiselle
ne
s
en
servira
this
is
the
thing
i
now
write
of
and
at
sight
of
it
i
understood
why
there
had
been
that
snapping
and
crackling
and
what
the
white
fragments
on
the
ground
were
i
hurried
through
the
rooms
hoping
to
see
a
continuation
of
that
drama
a
scene
of
appeasement
perhaps
or
of
fury
still
implacable
but
the
two
players
were
not
performing
there
my
waiter
had
told
me
he
had
not
seen
either
of
them
before
i
suppose
they
had
arrived
that
day
but
i
was
not
destined
to
see
either
of
them
again
they
went
away
i
suppose
next
morning
jointly
or
singly
singly
i
imagine
they
made
however
a
prolonged
stay
in
my
young
memory
and
would
have
done
so
even
had
i
not
had
that
tangible
memento
of
them
who
were
they
those
two
of
whom
that
one
strange
glimpse
had
befallen
me
what
i
wondered
was
the
previous
history
of
each
what
in
particular
had
all
that
tragic
pother
been
about
mlle
ange
lique
i
guessed
to
be
thirty
years
old
her
friend
perhaps
each
of
their
faces
was
as
clear
to
me
as
in
the
moment
of
actual
vision
the
man
s
fat
shiny
bewildered
face
the
taut
white
face
of
the
woman
the
hard
red
line
of
her
mouth
the
eyes
that
were
not
flashing
but
positively
dull
with
rage
i
presumed
that
the
fan
had
been
a
present
from
him
and
a
recent
present
bought
perhaps
that
very
day
after
their
arrival
in
the
town
but
what
what
had
he
done
that
she
should
break
it
between
her
hands
scattering
the
splinters
as
who
should
sow
dragon
s
teeth
i
could
not
believe
he
had
done
anything
much
amiss
i
imagined
her
grievance
a
trivial
one
but
this
did
not
make
the
case
less
engrossing
again
and
again
i
would
take
the
from
my
pocket
examining
it
on
the
palm
of
my
hand
or
between
finger
and
thumb
hoping
to
read
the
mystery
it
had
been
mixed
up
in
so
that
i
might
reveal
that
mystery
to
the
world
to
the
world
yes
nothing
less
than
that
i
was
determined
to
make
a
story
of
what
i
had
seen
a
conte
in
the
manner
of
great
guy
de
maupassant
now
and
again
in
the
course
of
the
past
year
or
so
it
had
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
be
a
writer
but
i
had
not
felt
the
impulse
to
sit
down
and
write
something
i
did
feel
that
impulse
now
it
would
indeed
have
been
an
irresistible
impulse
if
i
had
known
just
what
to
write
i
felt
i
might
know
at
any
moment
and
had
but
to
give
my
mind
to
it
maupassant
was
an
impeccable
artist
but
i
think
the
secret
of
the
hold
he
had
on
the
young
men
of
my
day
was
not
so
much
that
we
discerned
his
cunning
as
that
we
delighted
in
the
simplicity
which
his
cunning
achieved
i
had
read
a
great
number
of
his
short
stories
but
none
that
had
made
me
feel
as
though
i
if
i
were
a
writer
mightn
t
have
written
it
myself
maupassant
had
an
european
reputation
it
was
pleasing
it
was
soothing
and
gratifying
to
feel
that
one
could
at
any
time
win
an
equal
fame
if
one
chose
to
set
pen
to
paper
and
now
suddenly
the
spring
had
been
touched
in
me
the
time
was
come
i
was
grateful
for
the
fluke
by
which
i
had
witnessed
on
the
terrace
that
evocative
scene
i
looked
forward
to
reading
the
of
the
fan
at
latest
i
was
not
wildly
ambitious
i
was
not
inordinately
vain
i
knew
i
couldn
t
ever
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
write
like
george
meredith
those
wondrous
works
of
his
seething
with
wit
with
poetry
and
philosophy
and
what
not
never
had
beguiled
me
with
the
sense
that
i
might
do
something
similar
i
had
full
consciousness
of
not
being
a
philosopher
of
not
being
a
poet
and
of
not
being
a
wit
well
maupassant
was
none
of
these
things
he
was
just
an
observer
like
me
of
course
he
was
a
good
deal
older
than
i
and
had
observed
a
good
deal
more
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
not
my
superior
in
knowledge
of
life
i
knew
all
about
life
through
him
dimly
the
initial
paragraph
of
my
tale
floated
in
my
mind
i
not
exactly
i
myself
but
rather
that
impersonal
je
familiar
to
me
through
maupassant
was
to
be
sitting
at
that
table
with
a
bock
before
me
just
as
i
had
sat
four
or
five
short
sentences
would
give
the
whole
scene
one
of
these
i
had
quite
definitely
composed
you
have
already
heard
it
down
below
the
sea
rustled
to
and
fro
over
the
these
words
which
pleased
me
much
were
to
do
double
duty
they
were
to
recur
they
were
to
be
by
a
fine
stroke
the
very
last
words
of
my
tale
their
tranquillity
striking
a
sharp
ironic
contrast
with
the
stress
of
what
had
just
been
narrated
i
had
you
see
advanced
further
in
the
form
of
my
tale
than
in
the
substance
but
even
the
form
was
as
yet
vague
what
exactly
was
to
happen
after
mlle
ange
lique
and
joumand
as
i
provisionally
called
him
had
rushed
back
past
me
into
the
casino
it
was
clear
that
i
must
hear
the
whole
inner
history
from
the
lips
of
one
or
the
other
of
them
which
should
joumand
stagger
out
on
to
the
terrace
sit
down
heavily
at
the
table
next
to
mine
bury
his
head
in
his
hands
and
presently
in
broken
words
blurt
out
to
me
all
that
might
be
of
interest
and
i
tell
you
i
gave
up
everything
for
her
he
stared
at
me
with
his
old
hopeless
eyes
she
is
more
than
the
fiend
i
have
described
to
you
yet
i
swear
to
you
monsieur
that
if
i
had
anything
left
to
give
it
should
be
down
below
the
sea
rustled
to
and
fro
over
the
or
should
the
lady
herself
be
my
informant
for
a
while
i
rather
leaned
to
this
alternative
it
was
more
exciting
it
seemed
to
make
the
writer
more
signally
a
man
of
the
world
on
the
other
hand
it
was
less
simple
to
manage
wronged
persons
might
be
ever
so
communicative
but
i
surmised
that
persons
in
the
wrong
were
reticent
mlle
ange
lique
therefore
would
have
to
be
modified
by
me
in
appearance
and
behaviour
toned
down
touched
up
and
poor
joumand
must
look
like
a
man
of
whom
one
could
believe
anything
she
ceased
speaking
she
gazed
down
at
the
fragments
of
her
fan
and
then
as
though
finding
in
them
an
image
of
her
own
life
whispered
to
think
what
i
once
was
monsieur
what
but
for
him
i
might
be
even
now
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
then
stared
out
into
the
night
suddenly
she
uttered
a
short
harsh
laugh
down
below
the
sea
rustled
to
and
fro
over
the
i
decided
that
i
must
choose
the
first
of
these
two
ways
it
was
the
less
chivalrous
as
well
as
the
less
lurid
way
but
clearly
it
was
the
more
artistic
as
well
as
the
easier
the
chose
vue
the
tranche
de
la
vie
this
was
the
thing
to
aim
at
honesty
was
the
best
policy
i
must
be
nothing
if
not
merciless
maupassant
was
nothing
if
not
merciless
he
would
not
have
spared
mlle
ange
lique
besides
why
should
i
libel
joumand
poor
no
not
poor
joumand
i
warned
myself
against
pitying
him
one
touch
of
sentimentality
and
i
should
be
lost
joumand
was
ridiculous
i
must
keep
him
so
but
what
was
his
position
in
life
was
he
a
lawyer
perhaps
or
the
proprietor
of
a
shop
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
i
toyed
with
the
possibility
that
he
kept
a
fan
shop
that
the
business
had
once
been
a
prosperous
one
but
had
gone
down
down
because
of
his
infatuation
for
this
woman
to
whom
he
was
always
giving
fans
which
she
always
smashed
ah
monsieur
cruel
and
ungrateful
to
me
though
she
is
i
swear
to
you
that
if
i
had
anything
left
to
give
it
should
be
hers
but
he
stared
at
me
with
his
old
hopeless
eyes
the
fan
she
broke
was
the
last
the
last
monsieur
of
my
down
below
but
i
pulled
myself
together
and
asked
pardon
of
my
muse
it
may
be
that
i
had
offended
her
by
my
fooling
or
it
may
be
that
she
had
a
sisterly
desire
to
shield
mlle
ange
lique
from
my
mordant
art
or
it
may
be
that
she
was
bent
on
saving
de
maupassant
from
a
dangerous
rivalry
anyway
she
withheld
from
me
the
inspiration
i
had
so
confidently
solicited
i
could
not
think
what
had
led
up
to
that
scene
on
the
terrace
i
tried
hard
and
soberly
i
turned
the
chose
vue
over
and
over
in
my
mind
day
by
day
and
the
over
and
over
in
my
hand
but
the
chose
a
figurer
what
oh
what
was
that
nightly
i
revisited
the
cafe
and
sat
there
with
an
open
mind
a
mind
to
catch
the
idea
that
should
drop
into
it
like
a
ripe
golden
plum
the
plum
did
not
ripen
the
mind
remained
for
a
week
or
more
but
nothing
except
that
phrase
about
the
sea
rustled
to
and
fro
in
it
a
full
quarter
of
a
century
has
gone
by
joumand
s
death
so
far
too
fat
was
he
all
those
years
ago
may
be
presumed
a
temper
so
violent
as
mlle
angélique
s
must
surely
have
brought
its
owner
to
the
grave
long
since
but
here
all
unchanged
the
stump
of
her
fan
is
and
once
more
i
turn
it
over
and
over
in
my
hand
not
learning
its
secret
no
nor
even
trying
to
now
the
chord
this
relic
strikes
in
me
is
not
one
of
curiosity
as
to
that
old
quarrel
but
if
you
will
forgive
me
one
of
tenderness
for
my
first
effort
to
write
and
for
my
first
hopes
of
excellence
how
shall
i
word
it
it
would
seem
that
i
am
one
of
those
travellers
for
whom
the
railway
bookstall
does
not
cater
whenever
i
start
on
a
journey
i
find
that
my
choice
lies
between
books
which
i
have
no
wish
to
read
and
books
which
i
could
not
read
without
permanent
injury
to
my
eyesight
the
keeper
of
the
bookstall
seeing
me
gaze
vaguely
along
his
shelves
suggests
that
i
should
take
fen
country
fanny
or
else
the
track
of
blood
and
have
done
with
it
not
wishing
to
hurt
his
feelings
i
refuse
these
works
on
the
plea
that
i
have
read
them
whereon
he
divining
despite
me
that
i
am
a
superior
person
says
here
is
a
nice
little
handy
edition
of
more
s
utopia
or
carlyle
s
french
revolution
and
again
i
make
some
excuse
what
pleasure
could
i
get
from
trying
to
cope
with
a
masterpiece
printed
in
diminutive
type
on
a
little
page
i
relieve
the
bookstall
of
nothing
but
a
newspaper
or
two
the
other
day
however
my
eye
and
fancy
were
caught
by
a
book
entitled
how
shall
i
word
it
and
a
complete
letter
writer
for
men
and
i
had
never
read
one
of
these
manuals
but
had
often
heard
that
there
was
a
great
and
constant
demand
for
them
so
i
demanded
this
one
it
is
no
great
fun
in
itself
the
writer
is
no
fool
he
has
evidently
a
natural
talent
for
writing
letters
his
style
is
for
the
most
part
discreet
and
easy
if
you
were
a
young
man
writing
to
father
of
girl
he
wishes
to
marry
or
thanking
fiance
e
for
present
or
reproaching
fiance
e
for
being
a
flirt
or
if
you
were
a
mother
asking
governess
her
qualifications
or
replying
to
undesirable
invitation
for
her
child
or
indeed
if
you
were
in
any
other
one
of
the
crises
which
this
book
is
designed
to
alleviate
you
might
copy
out
and
post
the
letter
without
making
yourself
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
its
receiver
unless
of
course
he
or
she
also
possessed
a
copy
of
the
book
but
well
can
you
conceive
any
one
copying
out
and
posting
one
of
these
letters
or
even
taking
it
as
the
basis
for
composition
you
can
not
that
shows
how
little
you
know
of
your
not
you
nor
i
can
plumb
the
abyss
at
the
bottom
of
which
such
humility
is
possible
nevertheless
as
we
know
by
that
great
and
constant
demand
there
the
abyss
is
and
there
multitudes
are
at
the
bottom
of
it
let
s
peer
down
no
all
is
darkness
but
faintly
if
we
listen
hard
is
borne
up
to
us
a
sound
of
the
scratching
of
innumerable
pens
pens
whose
wielders
are
all
trying
as
the
author
of
this
handbook
urges
them
to
be
original
fresh
and
interesting
by
dint
of
more
or
less
strict
adherence
to
sample
giddily
you
draw
back
from
the
edge
of
the
abyss
come
here
is
a
thought
to
steady
you
the
mysterious
great
masses
of
helpless
folk
for
whom
how
shall
i
word
it
is
written
are
sound
at
heart
delicate
in
feeling
anxious
to
please
most
loth
to
wound
for
it
must
be
presumed
that
the
author
s
style
of
is
informed
as
much
by
a
desire
to
give
his
public
what
it
needs
and
will
pay
for
as
by
his
own
beautiful
nature
and
in
the
course
of
all
the
letters
that
he
dictates
you
will
find
not
one
harsh
word
not
one
ignoble
thought
or
unkind
insinuation
in
all
of
them
though
so
many
are
for
the
use
of
persons
placed
in
the
most
trying
circumstances
and
some
of
them
are
for
persons
writhing
under
a
sense
of
intolerable
injury
sweetness
and
light
do
ever
reign
even
yours
truly
jacob
langton
in
his
letter
to
his
daughter
s
mercenary
fiance
mitigates
the
sternness
of
his
tone
by
the
remark
that
his
task
is
inexpressibly
and
he
langton
is
the
one
writer
who
lets
the
post
go
out
on
his
wrath
when
horace
masterton
of
thorpe
road
putney
receives
from
miss
jessica
weir
of
fir
villa
blackheath
a
letter
declaring
her
change
of
feelings
does
he
upbraid
her
no
it
was
honest
and
brave
of
you
to
write
to
me
so
straightforwardly
and
at
the
back
of
my
mind
i
know
you
have
done
what
is
best
i
give
you
back
your
freedom
only
at
your
desire
god
bless
you
not
less
admirable
is
the
behaviour
in
similar
case
of
cecil
grant
glover
street
streatham
suddenly
as
a
bolt
from
the
blue
comes
a
letter
from
miss
louie
hawke
elm
view
deerhurst
breaking
off
her
betrothal
to
him
haggard
he
sits
down
to
his
desk
his
pen
traverses
the
notepaper
calling
down
curses
on
louie
and
on
all
her
sex
no
one
can
not
say
for
ever
without
deep
regret
to
days
that
have
been
so
full
of
happiness
i
must
thank
you
sincerely
for
all
your
great
kindness
to
me
with
every
sincere
wish
for
your
future
happiness
he
bestows
complete
freedom
on
miss
hawke
and
do
not
imagine
that
in
the
matter
of
and
sympathy
of
power
to
understand
all
and
pardon
all
the
men
are
lagged
behind
by
the
women
miss
leila
johnson
the
manse
carlyle
has
observed
in
leonard
wace
dover
street
saltburn
a
certain
coldness
of
demeanour
yet
i
do
not
blame
you
it
is
probably
your
nature
and
leila
in
her
sweet
forbearance
is
typical
of
all
the
other
pained
women
in
these
pages
she
is
but
one
of
a
crowd
of
heroines
face
to
face
with
all
this
perfection
the
not
perfect
reader
begins
to
crave
some
little
outburst
of
wrath
of
hatred
or
malice
from
one
of
these
imaginary
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
longs
for
how
shall
he
word
it
a
glimpse
of
some
bad
motive
of
some
little
lapse
from
dignity
often
passing
by
a
i
have
wished
i
could
unlock
it
and
carry
away
its
contents
to
be
studied
at
my
leisure
i
have
always
thought
such
a
haul
would
abound
in
things
fascinating
to
a
student
of
human
nature
one
night
not
long
ago
i
took
a
waxen
impression
of
the
lock
of
the
nearest
to
my
house
and
had
a
key
made
this
implement
i
have
as
yet
lacked
either
the
courage
or
the
opportunity
to
use
and
now
i
think
i
shall
throw
it
away
no
i
shan
t
i
refuse
after
all
to
draw
my
inference
that
the
bulk
of
the
british
public
writes
always
in
the
manner
of
this
handbook
even
if
they
all
have
beautiful
natures
they
must
sometimes
be
sent
slightly
astray
by
inferior
impulses
just
as
are
you
and
i
and
if
err
they
must
surely
it
were
well
they
should
know
how
to
do
it
correctly
and
forcibly
i
suggest
to
our
author
that
he
should
sprinkle
his
next
edition
with
a
few
less
righteous
examples
thereby
both
purging
his
book
of
its
monotony
and
somewhat
justifying
its
like
most
people
who
are
in
the
habit
of
writing
things
to
be
printed
i
have
not
the
knack
of
writing
really
good
letters
but
let
me
crudely
indicate
the
sort
of
thing
that
our
manual
needs
letter
from
poor
man
to
obtain
money
from
rich
one
the
english
law
is
particularly
hard
on
what
is
called
blackmail
it
is
therefore
essential
that
the
applicant
should
write
nothing
that
might
afterwards
be
twisted
to
incriminate
ed
dear
sir
as
i
was
turning
out
a
drawer
in
my
attic
i
came
across
a
letter
which
by
a
curious
chance
fell
into
my
hands
some
years
ago
and
which
in
the
stress
of
grave
pecuniary
embarrassment
had
escaped
my
memory
it
is
a
letter
written
by
yourself
to
a
lady
and
the
date
shows
it
to
have
been
written
shortly
after
your
marriage
it
is
of
a
confidential
nature
and
might
i
fear
if
it
fell
into
the
wrong
hands
be
cruelly
misconstrued
i
would
wish
you
to
have
the
satisfaction
of
destroying
it
in
person
at
first
i
thought
of
sending
it
on
to
you
by
post
but
i
know
how
happy
you
are
in
your
domestic
life
and
probably
your
wife
and
you
in
your
perfect
mutual
trust
are
in
the
habit
of
opening
each
other
s
letters
therefore
to
avoid
risk
i
would
prefer
to
hand
the
document
to
you
personally
i
will
not
ask
you
to
come
to
my
attic
where
i
could
not
offer
you
such
hospitality
as
is
due
to
a
man
of
your
wealth
and
position
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
meet
me
at
sharp
thursday
beside
the
tenth
to
the
left
on
the
surrey
side
of
waterloo
bridge
at
which
hour
and
place
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
i
am
dear
sir
yours
respectfully
james
gridge
letter
from
young
man
refusing
to
pay
his
tailor
s
bill
eustace
davenant
has
received
the
screed
which
yardley
has
addressed
to
him
let
yardley
cease
from
crawling
on
his
knees
and
shaking
his
fist
neither
this
posture
nor
this
gesture
can
wring
one
bent
farthing
from
the
pockets
of
davenant
who
was
a
minor
at
the
time
when
that
series
of
suits
was
supplied
to
him
and
will
hereafter
as
in
the
past
shout
without
prejudice
from
the
that
of
all
the
tailors
in
london
yardley
is
at
once
the
most
grasping
and
the
least
competent
letter
to
thank
author
for
inscribed
copy
of
book
dear
emanuel
flower
it
was
kind
of
you
to
think
of
sending
me
a
copy
of
your
new
book
it
would
have
been
kinder
still
to
think
again
and
abandon
that
project
i
am
a
man
of
gentle
instincts
and
do
not
like
to
tell
you
that
a
flight
into
arcady
of
which
i
have
skimmed
a
few
pages
thus
wasting
two
or
three
minutes
of
my
not
altogether
worthless
time
is
trash
on
the
other
hand
i
am
determined
that
you
shall
not
be
able
to
go
around
boasting
to
your
friends
if
you
have
any
that
this
work
was
not
condemned
derided
and
dismissed
by
your
sincere
wrexford
cripps
letter
to
member
of
parliament
unseated
at
general
election
dear
though
i
am
myself
an
ardent
tory
i
can
not
but
rejoice
in
the
crushing
defeat
you
have
just
suffered
in
west
odgetown
there
are
moments
when
political
conviction
is
overborne
by
personal
sentiment
and
this
is
one
of
them
your
loss
of
the
seat
that
you
held
is
the
more
striking
by
reason
of
the
splendid
manner
in
which
the
northern
and
eastern
divisions
of
odgetown
have
been
wrested
from
the
liberal
party
the
great
bulk
of
the
public
will
be
puzzled
by
your
extinction
in
the
midst
of
our
party
s
triumph
but
then
the
great
mass
of
the
public
has
not
met
you
i
have
you
will
probably
not
remember
me
you
are
the
sort
of
man
who
would
not
remember
anybody
who
might
not
be
of
some
definite
use
to
him
such
at
least
was
one
of
the
impressions
you
made
on
me
when
i
met
you
last
summer
at
a
dinner
given
by
our
friends
the
pelhams
among
the
other
things
in
you
that
struck
me
were
the
blatant
pomposity
of
your
manner
your
appalling
flow
of
cheap
platitudes
and
your
hoggish
lack
of
ideas
it
is
such
men
as
you
that
lower
the
tone
of
public
life
and
i
am
sure
that
in
writing
to
you
thus
i
am
but
expressing
what
is
felt
without
distinction
of
party
by
all
who
sat
with
you
in
the
late
parliament
the
one
person
in
whose
behalf
i
regret
your
withdrawal
into
private
life
is
your
wife
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
taking
in
to
the
aforesaid
dinner
it
was
evident
to
me
that
she
was
a
woman
whose
spirit
was
broken
by
her
conjunction
with
you
such
remnants
of
cheerfulness
as
were
in
her
i
attributed
to
the
parliamentary
duties
which
kept
you
out
of
her
sight
for
so
very
many
hours
daily
i
do
not
like
to
think
of
the
fate
to
which
the
free
and
independent
electors
of
west
odgetown
have
just
condemned
her
only
remember
this
chattel
of
yours
though
she
is
and
timid
and
humble
she
despises
you
in
her
heart
i
am
dear
yours
very
truly
harold
thistlake
letter
from
young
lady
in
answer
to
invitation
from
old
schoolmistress
my
dear
miss
price
how
awfully
sweet
of
you
to
ask
me
to
stay
with
you
for
a
few
days
but
how
can
you
think
i
may
have
forgotten
you
for
of
course
i
think
of
you
so
very
often
and
of
the
three
ears
i
spent
at
your
school
because
it
is
such
a
joy
not
to
be
there
any
longer
and
if
one
is
at
all
down
it
bucks
one
up
derectly
to
remember
that
thats
all
over
atanyrate
and
that
one
has
enough
food
to
nurrish
one
and
not
that
awful
monottany
of
life
and
not
the
petty
fogging
daily
tirrany
you
went
in
for
and
i
can
imagin
no
greater
thrill
and
luxury
in
a
way
than
to
come
and
see
the
whole
dismal
grind
still
going
on
but
without
me
being
in
it
but
this
would
be
rather
beastly
of
me
wouldn
t
it
so
please
dear
miss
price
dont
expect
me
and
do
excuse
mistakes
of
english
composition
and
spelling
and
etcetra
in
your
affectionate
old
pupil
emily
therese
ps
i
often
rite
to
people
telling
them
where
i
was
edducated
and
highly
reckomending
you
letter
in
acknowledgement
of
wedding
present
dear
lady
amblesham
who
gives
quickly
says
the
old
proverb
gives
twice
for
this
reason
i
have
purposely
delayed
writing
to
you
lest
i
should
appear
to
thank
you
more
than
once
for
the
small
cheap
hideous
present
you
sent
me
on
the
occasion
of
my
recent
wedding
were
you
a
poor
woman
that
little
bowl
of
dresden
china
would
convict
you
of
tastelessness
merely
were
you
a
blind
woman
of
nothing
but
an
odious
parsimony
as
you
have
normal
eyesight
and
more
than
normal
wealth
your
gift
to
me
proclaims
you
at
once
a
philistine
and
a
miser
or
rather
did
so
proclaim
you
until
less
than
ten
seconds
after
i
had
unpacked
it
from
its
wrappings
of
tissue
paper
i
took
it
to
the
open
window
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
it
shattered
to
atoms
on
the
pavement
but
stay
i
perceive
a
possible
flaw
in
my
argument
perhaps
you
were
guided
in
your
choice
by
a
definite
wish
to
insult
me
i
am
sure
on
reflection
that
this
was
so
i
shall
not
forget
yours
cynthia
beaumarsh
ps
my
husband
asks
me
to
tell
you
to
warn
lord
amblesham
to
keep
out
of
his
way
or
to
assume
some
disguise
so
complete
that
he
will
not
be
recognised
by
him
and
horsewhipped
pps
i
am
sending
copies
of
this
letter
to
the
principal
london
and
provincial
newspapers
letter
from
but
enough
i
never
thought
i
should
be
so
strong
in
this
line
i
had
not
foreseen
such
copiousness
and
fatal
fluency
never
again
will
i
tap
these
deep
dark
reservoirs
in
a
character
that
had
always
seemed
to
me
on
the
whole
so
amiable
mobled
king
just
as
a
memorial
just
to
perpetuate
in
one
s
mind
the
dead
man
in
whose
image
and
honour
it
has
been
erected
this
statue
is
better
than
any
that
i
have
seen
no
pedantic
reader
i
ought
not
to
have
said
than
any
other
that
i
have
seen
except
in
shrouded
and
distorted
outline
i
have
not
seen
this
statue
not
as
an
image
then
can
it
be
extolled
by
me
and
i
am
bound
to
say
that
even
as
an
honour
it
seems
to
me
more
than
dubious
commissioned
and
designed
and
chiselled
and
set
up
in
all
reverence
it
yet
serves
very
well
the
purpose
of
a
guy
this
does
not
surprise
you
you
are
familiar
with
a
host
of
statues
that
are
open
to
precisely
that
objection
westminster
abbey
abounds
in
them
they
confront
you
throughout
london
and
the
provinces
they
stud
the
continent
rare
indeed
is
the
statue
that
can
please
the
of
the
person
portrayed
nor
in
every
case
is
the
sculptor
to
blame
there
is
in
the
art
of
sculpture
itself
a
quality
intractable
to
the
aims
of
personal
portraiture
sculpture
just
as
it
can
not
fitly
record
the
gesture
of
a
moment
is
discommoded
by
personal
idiosyncrasies
the
details
that
go
to
compose
this
or
that
gentleman
s
appearance
such
as
the
little
wrinkles
around
his
eyes
and
the
way
his
hair
grows
and
the
special
convolutions
of
his
ears
all
these
presentable
on
canvas
or
evocable
by
words
are
not
right
matter
for
the
chisel
or
for
the
mould
and
furnace
translated
into
terms
of
bronze
or
marble
howsoever
cunningly
these
slight
and
trivial
things
cease
to
be
trivial
and
slight
they
assume
a
ludicrous
importance
no
man
is
worthy
to
be
reproduced
as
bust
or
statue
and
if
sculpture
is
too
august
to
deal
with
what
a
man
has
received
from
his
maker
how
much
less
ought
it
to
be
bothered
about
what
he
has
received
from
his
hosier
and
tailor
sculpture
s
province
is
the
soul
the
most
concrete
it
is
also
the
most
spiritual
of
the
arts
the
very
heaviness
and
stubbornness
of
its
material
precluding
it
from
happy
dalliance
with
us
fleeting
individual
creatures
fit
it
to
cope
with
that
which
in
mankind
is
permanent
and
universal
it
can
through
the
symbol
give
us
incomparably
the
type
wise
is
that
sculptor
who
when
portray
an
individual
he
must
treats
arbitrarily
the
mere
actual
husk
and
strives
but
to
show
the
soul
of
course
he
must
first
catch
that
soul
what
rodin
knew
about
the
character
and
career
of
george
wyndham
or
about
the
character
and
career
of
bernard
shaw
was
not
i
hazard
worth
knowing
and
shaw
is
handed
down
by
him
to
posterity
as
a
sort
of
bearded
lady
and
wyndham
as
a
sort
of
beardless
one
but
about
honore
de
balzac
he
knew
much
balzac
he
understood
balzac
s
work
balzac
s
soul
in
that
great
rugged
figure
aspiring
and
indeflexible
he
gave
us
with
a
finality
that
could
have
been
achieved
through
no
other
art
than
sculpture
there
is
a
close
kinship
between
that
statue
of
balzac
and
this
statue
of
which
i
am
to
tell
you
both
induce
above
all
a
profound
sense
of
unrest
of
heroic
will
to
overcome
all
obstacles
the
will
to
compass
the
will
to
emerge
from
darkness
to
light
from
formlessness
to
form
from
nothing
to
everything
this
it
is
that
i
find
in
either
statue
and
this
it
is
in
virtue
of
which
the
balzac
has
unbeknown
a
brother
on
the
italian
seaboard
here
stands
or
rather
struggles
on
his
pedestal
this
younger
brother
in
strange
contrast
with
the
scenery
about
him
mildly
behind
his
back
the
sea
laps
the
shingle
mildly
in
front
of
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
rise
some
of
those
mountains
whereby
the
earth
before
she
settled
down
to
cool
compassed
she
too
some
sort
of
mildly
around
his
pedestal
among
rusty
anchors
strewn
there
on
the
grass
between
road
and
beach
sit
the
fishermen
mending
their
nets
or
their
sails
or
whittling
bits
of
wood
what
will
you
say
of
these
fishermen
when
but
i
outstrip
my
narrative
i
had
no
inkling
of
tragedy
when
first
i
came
to
the
statue
i
did
not
even
know
it
was
a
statue
i
had
made
by
night
the
short
journey
from
genoa
to
this
place
beside
the
sea
and
driving
along
the
to
the
hotel
that
had
been
recommended
i
passed
what
in
the
starlight
looked
like
nothing
but
an
elderly
woman
mounted
on
a
square
pedestal
and
gazing
out
seaward
a
stout
elderly
lonely
woman
in
a
poke
bonnet
indescribable
except
by
that
old
victorian
term
a
party
and
as
unlike
balzac
s
younger
brother
as
only
sarah
gamp
s
elder
sister
could
be
how
i
wondered
in
my
hotel
came
the
elder
sister
of
sarah
gamp
to
be
here
in
liguria
and
in
the
twentieth
century
how
clomb
she
puffing
and
panting
on
to
that
pedestal
for
what
argosy
of
gin
was
she
straining
her
old
eyes
seaward
i
knew
there
would
be
no
sleep
for
me
until
i
had
solved
these
problems
and
i
went
forth
afoot
along
the
way
i
had
come
the
moon
had
risen
and
presently
i
saw
in
the
starlight
the
party
who
so
intrigued
me
eminent
amorphous
mysterious
there
she
stood
immobile
voluminous
ghastly
beneath
the
moon
by
a
slight
shoreward
lift
of
crinoline
as
against
the
seaward
protrusion
of
poke
bonnet
a
grotesque
balance
was
given
to
the
unshapely
shape
of
her
for
all
her
uncanniness
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
any
one
male
or
female
old
or
young
look
so
hopelessly
common
i
felt
that
by
daylight
a
noble
vulgarity
might
be
hers
in
the
watches
of
the
night
she
was
hopelessly
she
was
transcendently
common
little
by
little
as
i
came
nearer
she
ceased
to
illude
me
and
i
began
to
think
of
her
as
what
it
was
however
i
knew
not
until
i
was
at
quite
close
quarters
to
the
pedestal
it
rose
from
there
on
the
polished
granite
was
carved
this
legend
a
umberto
io
and
instinctively
as
my
eye
travelled
up
my
hand
leapt
to
the
salute
for
i
stood
before
the
veiled
image
of
a
dead
king
and
had
been
guilty
of
a
misconception
that
dishonoured
him
standing
respectfully
at
one
angle
and
another
i
was
able
to
form
by
the
outlines
of
the
grey
sheeting
that
enveloped
him
some
rough
notion
of
his
posture
and
his
costume
round
what
was
evidently
his
neck
the
sheeting
was
constricted
by
ropes
and
the
height
and
girth
of
the
bundle
above
to
eyes
even
now
an
averted
gave
token
of
a
tall
helmet
with
a
luxuriant
shock
of
plumes
waving
out
behind
immediately
beneath
the
ropes
the
breadth
and
sharpness
of
the
bundle
hinted
at
epaulettes
and
the
protrusion
that
had
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
crinoline
was
caused
i
thought
by
the
king
having
his
left
hand
thrust
well
out
to
grasp
the
hilt
of
his
inclined
sword
altogether
i
had
soon
builded
a
clear
enough
idea
of
his
aspect
and
i
promised
myself
a
curious
gratification
in
comparing
anon
this
idea
with
his
aspect
as
it
really
was
yes
i
took
it
for
granted
that
the
expectant
statue
was
to
be
unveiled
within
the
next
few
days
i
was
glad
to
be
in
time
not
knowing
in
how
terribly
good
time
i
was
for
the
ceremony
not
since
my
early
childhood
had
i
seen
the
unveiling
of
a
statue
and
on
that
occasion
i
had
struck
a
discordant
note
by
weeping
bitterly
i
dare
say
you
know
that
statue
of
william
harvey
which
stands
on
the
leas
at
folkestone
you
say
you
were
present
at
the
unveiling
well
i
was
the
child
who
cried
i
had
been
told
that
william
harvey
was
a
great
and
good
man
who
discovered
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
my
mind
had
leapt
in
all
the
swiftness
of
its
immaturity
to
the
conclusion
that
his
statue
would
be
a
bright
cruel
was
the
thrill
of
dismay
i
had
when
at
length
the
cord
was
pulled
and
the
sheeting
slid
down
revealing
so
dull
a
sight
contemplating
the
veiled
umberto
i
remembered
that
sight
remembered
those
tears
unworthy
as
my
nurse
told
me
of
a
little
gentleman
years
had
passed
i
was
grown
older
and
wiser
i
had
learnt
to
expect
less
of
life
there
was
no
fear
that
i
should
disgrace
myself
in
the
matter
of
umberto
i
was
not
so
old
though
nor
so
wise
as
i
am
now
i
expected
more
than
there
is
of
italian
speed
and
less
than
there
is
of
italian
subtlety
a
whole
year
has
passed
since
first
i
set
eyes
on
veiled
umberto
and
umberto
is
still
veiled
and
veiled
for
more
than
a
whole
year
as
i
now
know
had
umberto
been
before
my
coming
four
years
before
that
the
municipal
council
it
seems
had
voted
the
money
for
him
his
father
of
sensational
memory
was
here
already
in
the
middle
of
the
main
piazza
of
course
and
garibaldi
was
hard
by
so
was
mazzini
so
was
cavour
umberto
was
still
implicit
in
a
block
of
marble
high
upon
one
of
the
mountains
of
carrara
the
task
of
educing
him
was
given
to
a
promising
young
sculptor
who
lived
here
down
came
the
block
of
marble
and
was
transported
to
the
studio
of
the
promising
young
sculptor
and
out
briskly
enough
mustachios
and
all
came
umberto
he
looked
very
regal
i
am
sure
as
he
stood
glaring
around
with
his
prominent
marble
eyeballs
and
snuffing
the
good
fresh
air
of
the
world
as
far
as
might
be
into
shallow
marble
nostrils
he
looked
very
authoritative
and
fierce
and
solemn
i
am
sure
he
made
anyhow
a
deep
impression
on
the
mayor
and
councillors
and
the
only
question
was
as
to
just
where
he
should
be
erected
the
granite
pedestal
had
already
been
hewn
and
graven
but
a
worthy
site
was
to
seek
outside
the
railway
station
he
would
obstruct
the
cabs
in
the
giardino
pubblico
he
would
clash
with
garibaldi
every
councillor
had
a
pet
site
and
every
other
one
a
pet
objection
to
it
that
strip
of
waste
ground
where
the
fishermen
sat
pottering
it
was
too
humble
too
far
from
the
centre
of
things
meanwhile
umberto
stayed
in
the
studio
dust
settled
on
his
epaulettes
a
year
went
by
spiders
ventured
to
spin
their
webs
from
his
plumes
to
his
mustachios
another
year
went
by
whenever
the
councillors
had
nothing
else
to
talk
about
they
talked
about
the
site
for
umberto
presently
they
became
aware
that
among
the
poorer
classes
of
the
town
had
arisen
a
certain
hostility
to
the
statue
the
councillors
suspected
that
the
priesthood
had
been
at
work
the
forces
of
reaction
against
the
forces
of
progress
very
well
the
councillors
hurriedly
decided
that
the
best
available
site
on
the
whole
was
that
strip
of
waste
ground
where
the
fishermen
sat
pottering
the
pedestal
was
promptly
planted
umberto
was
promptly
wrapped
up
put
on
a
lorry
wheeled
to
the
place
and
hoisted
into
position
the
date
of
the
unveiling
was
fixed
the
mayor
i
am
told
had
already
composed
his
speech
and
was
getting
it
by
heart
around
the
pedestal
the
fishermen
sat
pottering
it
was
not
observed
that
they
received
any
visits
from
the
priests
but
priests
are
subtle
and
it
is
a
fact
that
three
days
before
the
date
of
the
unveiling
the
fishermen
went
all
in
their
black
sunday
clothes
and
claimed
audience
of
the
mayor
he
laid
aside
the
of
his
speech
and
received
them
affably
old
agostino
their
spokesman
he
whose
face
is
so
marvellously
wrinkled
lifted
his
quavering
voice
he
told
the
mayor
with
great
respect
that
the
rights
of
the
fishermen
had
been
violated
that
piece
of
ground
had
for
hundreds
of
years
belonged
to
them
they
had
not
been
consulted
about
that
statue
they
did
not
want
it
there
it
was
in
the
way
and
must
said
agostino
be
removed
at
first
the
mayor
was
inclined
to
treat
the
deputation
with
a
light
good
humour
and
to
resume
the
study
of
his
ms
but
agostino
had
a
of
his
own
this
was
a
copy
of
a
charter
whereby
before
mayors
and
councillors
were
the
right
to
that
piece
of
land
had
been
granted
in
perpetuity
to
the
fisherfolk
of
the
district
the
mayor
not
committing
himself
to
any
opinion
of
the
validity
of
the
document
said
that
he
but
there
it
is
tedious
to
report
the
speeches
of
mayors
agostino
told
his
mayor
that
a
certain
great
lawyer
would
be
arriving
from
genoa
it
were
tedious
to
report
what
passed
between
that
great
lawyer
and
the
mayor
and
councillors
assembled
suffice
it
that
the
councillors
were
frightened
the
date
of
the
unveiling
was
postponed
and
the
whole
matter
referred
to
high
authorities
in
rome
went
darkly
drifting
into
some
form
of
litigation
and
there
abides
technically
then
neither
side
may
claim
that
it
has
won
the
statue
has
not
been
unveiled
but
the
statue
has
not
been
displaced
practically
though
and
morally
the
palm
is
so
far
to
the
fishermen
the
pedestal
does
not
really
irk
them
at
all
on
the
contrary
it
and
the
sheeting
do
cast
for
them
in
the
heat
a
pleasant
shadow
of
which
the
influence
of
fleet
street
once
felt
never
shaken
off
forces
me
to
say
they
are
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
and
the
cost
of
the
litigation
comes
not
you
may
be
sure
out
of
their
light
old
pockets
but
out
of
the
coffers
of
some
pious
rich
folk
hereabouts
the
pope
remains
a
prisoner
in
the
vatican
well
here
is
umberto
a
kind
of
hostage
yet
with
what
a
difference
here
is
no
spiritual
king
stripped
of
earthly
kingship
here
is
an
earthly
king
kept
swaddled
up
day
after
day
to
be
publicly
ridiculous
the
fishermen
as
i
have
said
pay
him
no
heed
the
mayor
passing
along
the
road
looks
straight
in
front
of
him
with
an
elaborate
assumption
of
unconcern
so
do
the
councillors
but
there
are
others
who
look
maliciously
up
at
the
hapless
figure
now
and
again
there
comes
a
monk
from
the
monastery
on
that
hill
yonder
he
laughs
into
his
beard
as
he
goes
by
two
by
two
in
their
grey
cloaks
and
their
blue
mantillas
the
little
orphan
girls
are
sometimes
marched
past
there
they
go
as
i
write
not
malice
but
a
vague
horror
is
in
the
eyes
they
turn
umberto
belike
is
used
as
a
means
to
frighten
them
when
or
lest
they
offend
the
nun
in
whose
charge
they
arc
crosses
herself
yet
it
is
recorded
of
umberto
that
he
was
kind
to
little
children
this
indeed
is
one
of
the
few
things
recorded
of
him
fierce
though
he
looked
he
was
for
the
most
part
it
must
be
confessed
null
he
seldom
asserted
himself
there
was
so
little
of
that
for
him
to
assert
he
had
therefore
no
personal
enemies
in
a
negative
way
he
was
popular
and
was
positively
popular
for
a
while
after
his
assassination
and
this
it
is
that
makes
him
now
the
less
able
poor
fellow
to
understand
and
endure
the
shame
he
is
put
to
stat
rex
he
does
try
to
assert
himself
now
does
strive
by
day
and
by
night
poor
petrefact
to
rip
off
these
fell
and
clownish
integuments
of
his
elder
brother
in
paris
he
has
never
heard
but
he
knows
that
lazarus
arisen
from
the
tomb
did
not
live
in
he
forgets
that
after
all
he
is
only
a
statue
to
himself
he
is
still
a
king
or
at
least
a
man
who
was
once
a
king
and
having
done
no
wrong
ought
not
now
to
be
insulted
if
he
had
in
his
composition
one
marble
grain
of
humour
he
might
but
no
a
joke
against
oneself
is
always
cryptic
fat
men
are
not
always
the
best
drivers
of
fat
oxen
and
cryptic
statues
can
not
be
depended
on
to
see
cryptic
jokes
if
umberto
could
grasp
the
truth
that
no
man
is
worthy
to
be
reproduced
as
a
statue
if
he
could
understand
once
and
for
all
that
the
unveiling
of
him
were
itself
a
notable
disservice
to
him
then
might
his
wrath
be
turned
to
acquiescence
and
his
acquiescence
to
gratitude
and
he
be
quite
happy
hid
is
he
really
more
ridiculous
now
than
he
always
was
if
you
be
an
extraordinary
man
as
was
his
father
win
a
throne
by
all
means
you
will
fill
it
if
your
son
be
another
extraordinary
man
he
will
fill
it
when
his
turn
comes
but
if
that
son
be
as
alas
he
most
probably
will
be
like
umberto
quite
ordinary
then
let
parental
love
triumph
over
pride
of
dynasty
advise
your
boy
to
abdicate
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
a
great
king
what
better
but
it
is
ill
that
a
throne
be
sat
on
by
one
whose
legs
dangle
uncertainly
towards
the
dais
and
ill
that
a
crown
settle
down
over
the
tip
of
the
nose
and
the
very
fact
that
for
quite
inadequate
kings
men
s
hands
do
leap
to
the
salute
instinctively
does
but
make
us
on
reflection
the
more
conscious
of
the
whole
absurdity
even
than
a
great
man
on
a
throne
we
can
when
we
reflect
imagine
something
ah
not
something
better
perhaps
but
something
more
remote
from
absurdity
let
us
say
that
umberto
s
father
was
great
as
well
as
extraordinary
he
was
accounted
great
enough
to
be
the
incarnation
of
a
great
idea
united
italy
oh
yes
a
great
idea
a
charming
idea
in
the
sixties
i
should
have
been
all
for
it
but
how
shall
i
or
any
other
impartial
person
write
odes
to
the
reality
what
people
in
all
this
exquisite
peninsula
are
the
happier
for
the
things
done
by
and
through
vittorio
emmanuele
liberator
the
question
is
not
merely
rhetorical
there
is
the
large
class
of
politicians
who
would
have
had
no
scope
in
the
old
days
and
there
are
the
many
men
who
in
other
days
would
have
been
fishing
or
ploughing
but
now
strut
in
this
and
that
official
uniform
there
passes
between
me
and
the
sea
as
i
write
how
opportunely
people
do
pass
here
a
little
man
with
a
peaked
cap
and
light
blue
breeches
and
a
sword
his
prime
duty
is
to
see
that
none
of
his
fellow
peasants
shall
carry
home
a
bucket
of
for
there
is
salt
in
and
heavily
because
they
must
have
it
or
sicken
salt
is
taxed
and
this
passing
sentinel
is
to
prevent
them
from
cheating
the
revenue
by
recourse
to
the
sea
which
though
here
it
is
they
must
not
regard
as
theirs
what
becomes
of
the
it
goes
towards
the
building
of
battleships
cruisers
gunboats
and
so
forth
what
are
these
for
why
for
italy
to
be
a
great
european
power
with
of
course
in
the
little
blue
bay
behind
umberto
while
i
write
there
lies
at
anchor
an
italian
gunboat
opportunely
again
i
can
but
assure
you
that
it
really
and
truly
is
there
it
has
been
there
for
two
days
it
delights
the
fishermen
they
say
it
is
bella
e
pulita
com
un
they
stand
shading
their
eyes
towards
it
smiling
and
proud
heirs
of
all
the
ages
neglecting
their
sails
and
nets
and
spars
of
wood
they
can
imagine
nothing
better
than
it
they
see
nothing
at
all
sinister
or
absurd
about
it
these
simple
fellows
and
simple
umberto
their
captive
strives
to
wheel
round
on
his
pedestal
and
to
tear
but
a
in
his
sheeting
he
would
be
glad
could
he
feast
but
one
eye
on
this
bit
of
national
glory
but
he
remains
helpless
helpless
as
a
sultana
made
ready
for
the
bosphorus
helpless
as
a
pig
is
in
a
poke
it
enrages
him
that
he
who
was
so
eminently
respectable
in
life
should
be
made
so
ludicrous
on
his
eminence
after
death
he
is
bitter
at
the
inertia
of
the
men
who
set
him
up
were
he
an
ornament
of
the
church
not
of
the
state
that
he
served
so
conscientiously
how
very
different
would
be
the
treatment
of
his
plight
if
he
were
a
saint
occluded
thus
by
the
municipality
how
many
the
prayers
that
would
be
muttered
the
candles
promised
for
his
release
there
would
be
processions
too
and
who
knows
but
that
there
might
even
be
a
miracle
vouchsafed
a
rending
of
the
veil
the
only
procession
that
passes
him
is
that
of
the
intimidated
orphans
no
heavenly
power
intervenes
for
him
perhaps
he
bitterly
conjectures
for
fear
of
offending
the
vatican
sirocco
now
and
again
blows
furiously
at
his
back
but
never
splits
the
sheeting
rain
often
soaks
it
never
rots
it
there
is
no
help
for
him
he
stands
a
mock
to
the
pious
a
shame
and
incubus
to
the
emancipated
received
yet
hushed
up
exalted
yet
made
a
fool
of
taken
and
left
a
monument
to
fate
s
malice
from
under
the
hem
of
his
domino
always
he
just
displays
with
a
sort
of
tragic
coquetry
the
toe
of
a
stout
and
serviceable
marble
boot
and
this
i
have
begun
to
believe
is
all
that
i
shall
ever
see
of
him
else
might
i
not
be
writing
about
him
for
else
had
he
not
so
haunted
me
if
i
knew
myself
destined
to
see
him
to
see
him
steadily
and
see
him
whole
no
matter
how
many
years
hence
i
could
forthwith
think
about
other
things
i
had
hoped
that
by
this
essay
i
might
rid
my
mind
of
him
he
is
inexcutible
confound
him
his
pedestal
draws
me
to
itself
with
some
such
fascination
as
had
the
altar
of
the
unknown
god
for
the
wondering
greek
i
try
to
distract
myself
by
thinking
of
other
images
images
that
i
have
seen
i
think
of
bartolommeo
colleoni
riding
greatly
forth
under
the
shadow
of
the
church
of
saint
john
and
saint
paul
of
peabody
i
think
cosy
in
his
armchair
behind
the
royal
exchange
of
nelson
above
the
sparrows
and
of
perseus
among
the
pigeons
of
golden
albert
and
of
harvey
the
not
red
up
looms
umberto
uncouthly
casting
them
one
and
all
into
the
shade
i
think
of
other
statues
that
i
have
not
seen
statues
suspected
of
holding
something
back
from
even
the
men
who
have
stood
beholding
and
soliciting
them
but
how
obvious
beside
umberto
the
sphinx
would
be
and
memnon
how
tamely
he
sits
waiting
for
the
dawn
matchless
as
a
memorial
then
i
say
again
this
statue
is
and
as
a
work
of
art
it
has
at
least
the
advantage
of
being
beyond
criticism
in
my
young
days
i
wrote
a
plea
that
all
the
statues
in
the
streets
and
squares
of
london
should
be
extirpated
and
according
to
their
materials
smashed
or
melted
from
an
aesthetic
standpoint
i
went
a
trifle
too
far
london
has
a
few
good
statues
from
an
humane
standpoint
my
plea
was
all
wrong
let
no
violence
be
done
to
the
effigies
of
the
dead
there
is
disrespect
in
setting
up
a
dead
man
s
effigy
and
then
not
unveiling
it
but
there
would
be
no
disrespect
and
there
would
be
no
violence
if
the
bad
statues
familiar
to
london
were
ceremoniously
veiled
and
their
inscribed
pedestals
left
just
as
they
are
that
is
a
scheme
which
occurred
to
me
soon
after
i
saw
the
veiled
umberto
birrell
has
now
stepped
in
and
forestalled
my
advocacy
pereant
qui
but
no
who
could
wish
that
charming
man
to
perish
the
realisation
of
that
scheme
is
what
matters
let
an
inventory
be
taken
of
those
statues
let
it
be
submitted
to
lord
rosebery
and
he
be
asked
to
tick
off
all
those
statesmen
poets
philosophers
and
other
personages
about
whom
he
would
wish
to
orate
then
let
the
list
be
passed
on
to
other
orators
until
every
statue
on
it
shall
have
its
particular
spokesman
then
let
the
dates
for
the
various
veilings
be
appointed
if
there
be
four
or
five
veilings
every
week
i
conceive
that
the
whole
list
will
be
exhausted
in
two
years
or
so
and
my
enjoyment
of
the
reported
speeches
will
not
be
the
less
keen
because
i
can
so
well
imagine
them
in
conclusion
lord
rosebery
said
that
the
keynote
to
the
character
of
the
man
in
whose
honour
they
were
gathered
together
was
first
and
last
integrity
applause
he
did
not
say
of
him
that
he
had
been
infallible
which
of
us
was
infallible
laughter
but
this
he
would
say
that
the
great
man
whose
statue
they
were
looking
on
for
the
last
time
had
been
actuated
throughout
his
career
by
no
motive
but
the
desire
to
do
that
and
that
only
which
would
conduce
to
the
honour
and
to
the
stability
of
the
country
that
gave
him
birth
of
him
it
might
truly
be
said
as
had
been
said
of
another
that
which
he
had
to
give
he
loud
and
prolonged
applause
his
lordship
then
pulled
the
cord
and
the
sheeting
rolled
up
into
position
not
however
because
those
speeches
will
so
edify
and
soothe
me
nor
merely
because
those
veiled
statues
will
make
less
uncouth
the
city
i
was
born
in
do
i
feverishly
thrust
on
you
my
proposition
the
wish
in
me
is
that
posterity
shall
be
haunted
by
our
dead
heroes
even
as
i
am
by
umberto
rather
hard
on
posterity
well
the
prevision
of
its
plight
would
cheer
me
in
mine
immensely
kolniyatsch
none
of
us
who
keep
an
eye
on
the
heavens
of
european
literature
can
forget
the
emotion
that
we
felt
when
but
a
few
years
since
the
red
star
of
kolniyatsch
swam
into
our
ken
as
nobody
can
prove
that
i
wasn
t
i
claim
now
that
i
was
the
first
to
gauge
the
magnitude
of
this
star
and
to
predict
the
ascendant
course
which
it
has
in
fact
triumphantly
taken
that
was
in
the
days
when
kolniyatsch
was
still
alive
his
recent
death
gives
the
cue
for
the
boom
out
of
that
boom
i
for
one
will
not
be
left
i
rush
to
scrawl
my
name
large
on
the
tombstone
of
kolniyatsch
these
foreign
fellows
always
are
especially
to
be
commended
by
the
mere
mention
of
their
names
you
evoke
in
reader
or
hearer
a
vague
sense
of
your
superiority
and
his
thank
heaven
we
are
no
longer
insular
i
don
t
say
we
have
no
native
talent
we
have
heaps
of
it
pyramids
of
it
all
around
but
where
for
the
genuine
thrill
would
england
be
but
for
her
good
fortune
in
being
able
to
draw
on
a
seemingly
inexhaustible
supply
of
anguished
souls
from
the
continent
infantile
slavs
titan
teutons
greatly
blighted
scandinavians
all
of
them
different
but
all
of
them
raving
in
one
common
darkness
and
with
one
common
gesture
plucking
out
their
vitals
for
exportation
there
is
no
doubt
that
our
continuous
receipt
of
this
commodity
has
had
a
bracing
effect
on
our
national
character
we
used
to
be
rather
phlegmatic
used
we
not
we
have
learnt
to
be
vibrant
of
kolniyatsch
as
of
all
authentic
in
literature
it
is
true
that
he
must
be
judged
rather
by
what
he
wrote
than
by
what
he
was
but
the
quality
of
his
genius
albeit
nothing
if
not
national
and
also
universal
is
at
the
same
time
so
deeply
personal
that
we
can
not
afford
to
close
our
eyes
on
his
life
a
life
happily
not
void
of
those
sensational
details
which
are
what
we
all
really
care
about
if
you
have
tears
prepare
to
shed
them
kolniyatsch
was
born
last
of
a
long
line
of
in
at
the
age
of
nine
he
had
already
acquired
that
passionate
alcoholism
which
was
to
have
so
great
an
influence
in
the
moulding
of
his
character
and
on
the
trend
of
his
thought
otherwise
he
does
not
seem
to
have
shown
in
childhood
any
exceptional
promise
it
was
not
before
his
eighteenth
birthday
that
he
murdered
his
grandmother
and
was
sent
to
that
asylum
in
which
he
wrote
the
poems
and
plays
belonging
to
what
we
now
call
his
earlier
manner
in
he
escaped
from
his
sanctum
or
chuzketc
cell
as
he
sardonically
called
it
and
having
acquired
some
money
by
an
act
of
violence
gave
by
sailing
for
america
early
proof
that
his
genius
was
of
the
kind
that
crosses
frontiers
and
seas
unfortunately
it
was
not
of
the
kind
that
passes
ellis
island
america
to
her
lasting
shame
turned
him
back
early
in
we
find
him
once
more
in
his
old
quarters
working
at
those
novels
and
confessions
on
which
in
the
opinion
of
some
his
fame
will
ultimately
rest
alas
we
don
t
find
him
there
now
it
will
be
a
fortnight
ago
that
luntic
kolniyatsch
passed
peacefully
away
in
the
year
of
his
age
he
would
have
been
the
last
to
wish
us
to
indulge
in
any
sickly
sentimentality
nothing
is
here
for
tears
nothing
but
well
and
fair
and
what
may
quiet
us
in
a
death
so
was
kolniyatsch
mad
it
depends
on
what
we
mean
by
that
word
if
we
mean
as
the
bureaucrats
of
ellis
island
and
to
their
lasting
shame
his
friends
and
relations
presumably
meant
that
he
did
not
share
our
own
smug
and
timid
philosophy
of
life
then
indeed
was
kolniyatsch
not
sane
granting
for
sake
of
argument
that
he
was
mad
in
a
wider
sense
than
that
we
do
but
oppose
an
insuperable
to
the
eugenists
imagine
what
europe
would
be
had
kolniyatsch
not
been
as
one
of
the
critics
avers
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
a
time
may
be
not
far
distant
and
may
indeed
be
nearer
than
many
of
us
suppose
when
luntic
kolniyatsch
will
rightly
or
wrongly
be
reckoned
by
some
of
us
as
not
the
least
of
those
writers
who
are
especially
symptomatic
of
the
early
twentieth
century
and
are
possibly
for
all
time
or
for
a
more
or
less
certainly
not
inconsiderable
period
of
that
is
finely
said
but
i
myself
go
somewhat
further
i
say
that
kolniyatsch
s
message
has
drowned
all
previous
messages
and
will
drown
any
that
may
be
uttered
in
the
remotest
future
you
ask
me
what
precisely
that
message
was
well
it
is
too
elemental
too
near
to
the
very
heart
of
naked
nature
for
exact
definition
can
you
describe
the
message
of
an
angry
python
more
satisfactorily
than
as
or
that
of
an
infuriated
bull
better
than
as
moo
that
of
kolniyatsch
lies
somewhere
between
these
two
indeed
at
whatever
point
we
take
him
we
find
him
hard
to
fit
into
any
single
category
was
he
a
realist
or
a
romantic
he
was
neither
and
he
was
both
by
more
than
one
critic
he
has
been
called
a
pessimist
and
it
is
true
that
a
part
of
his
achievement
may
be
gauged
by
the
lengths
to
which
he
carried
pessimism
railing
and
raging
not
in
the
manner
of
his
tame
forerunners
merely
at
things
in
general
or
at
women
or
at
himself
but
lavishing
an
equally
fierce
scorn
and
hatred
on
children
on
trees
and
flowers
and
the
moon
and
indeed
on
everything
that
the
sentimentalists
have
endeavoured
to
force
into
favour
on
the
other
hand
his
burning
faith
in
a
personal
devil
his
frank
delight
in
earthquakes
and
pestilences
and
his
belief
that
every
one
but
himself
will
be
brought
back
to
life
in
time
to
be
frozen
to
death
in
the
next
glacial
epoch
seem
rather
to
stamp
him
as
an
optimist
by
birth
and
training
a
man
of
the
people
he
was
yet
an
aristocrat
to
the
and
byron
would
have
called
him
brother
though
one
trembles
to
think
what
he
would
have
called
byron
first
and
last
he
was
an
artist
and
it
is
by
reason
of
his
technical
mastery
that
he
most
of
all
outstands
whether
in
prose
or
in
verse
he
compasses
a
broken
rhythm
that
is
as
the
very
rhythm
of
life
itself
and
a
cadence
that
catches
you
by
the
throat
as
a
terrier
catches
a
rat
and
wrings
from
you
the
last
drop
of
pity
and
awe
his
skill
in
avoiding
the
inevitable
word
is
simply
miraculous
he
is
the
despair
of
the
translator
far
be
it
from
me
to
belittle
the
devoted
labours
of
and
pegaway
whose
monumental
translation
of
the
master
s
complete
works
is
now
drawing
to
its
splendid
close
their
promised
biography
of
the
murdered
grandmother
is
awaited
eagerly
by
all
who
take
and
which
of
us
does
not
take
a
breathless
interest
in
kolniyatschiana
but
and
pegaway
would
be
the
first
to
admit
that
their
renderings
of
the
prose
and
verse
they
love
so
well
are
a
wretched
substitute
for
the
real
thing
i
wanted
to
get
the
job
myself
but
they
nipped
in
and
got
it
before
me
thank
heaven
they
can
not
deprive
me
of
the
power
to
read
kolniyatsch
in
the
original
gibrisch
and
to
crow
over
you
who
can
t
of
the
man
himself
for
on
several
occasions
i
had
the
privilege
and
the
permit
to
visit
him
i
have
the
pleasantest
most
sacred
memories
his
was
a
wonderfully
vivid
and
intense
personality
the
head
was
beautiful
perfectly
conic
in
form
the
eyes
were
like
two
revolving
lamps
set
very
close
together
the
smile
was
haunting
there
was
a
touch
of
courtesy
in
the
repression
of
the
evident
impulse
to
spring
at
one
s
throat
the
voice
had
notes
that
recalled
s
in
the
later
and
more
important
passages
of
oedipe
roi
i
remember
that
he
always
spoke
with
the
greatest
contempt
of
and
pegaway
s
translations
he
likened
them
to
but
enough
his
boom
is
not
yet
at
the
full
a
few
weeks
hence
i
shall
be
able
to
command
an
even
higher
price
than
i
could
now
for
my
talks
with
no
the
pines
early
in
the
year
edmund
gosse
told
me
he
was
asking
certain
of
his
friends
to
write
for
him
a
few
words
apiece
in
description
of
swinburne
as
they
had
known
or
seen
him
at
one
time
or
another
and
he
was
so
good
as
to
wish
to
include
in
this
gathering
a
few
words
by
myself
i
found
it
hard
to
be
brief
without
seeming
irreverent
i
failed
in
the
attempt
to
make
of
my
subject
a
snapshot
that
was
not
a
grotesque
so
i
took
refuge
in
an
ampler
scope
i
wrote
a
reminiscential
essay
from
that
essay
i
made
an
extract
which
i
gave
to
gosse
from
that
extract
he
made
a
quotation
in
his
enchanting
biography
the
words
quoted
by
him
reappear
here
in
the
midst
of
the
whole
essay
as
i
wrote
it
i
dare
not
hope
they
are
unashamed
of
their
humble
m
b
in
my
youth
the
suburbs
were
rather
looked
down
on
i
never
quite
knew
why
it
was
held
anomalous
and
a
matter
for
merriment
that
swinburne
lived
in
one
of
them
for
my
part
had
i
known
as
a
fact
that
catullus
was
still
alive
i
should
have
been
as
ready
to
imagine
him
living
in
putney
as
elsewhere
the
marvel
would
have
been
merely
that
he
lived
and
swinburne
s
survival
struck
as
surely
as
could
his
have
struck
in
me
the
chord
of
wonder
not
of
course
that
he
had
achieved
a
feat
of
longevity
he
was
far
from
the
psalmist
s
limit
nor
was
he
one
of
those
men
whom
one
associates
with
the
era
in
which
they
happened
to
be
young
indeed
if
there
was
one
man
belonging
less
than
any
other
to
days
swinburne
was
that
man
but
by
the
calendar
it
was
in
those
days
that
he
had
blazed
blazed
forth
with
so
unexampled
a
suddenness
of
splendour
and
in
the
light
of
that
conflagration
all
that
he
had
since
done
much
and
magnificent
though
this
was
paled
the
essential
swinburne
was
still
the
earliest
he
was
and
would
always
be
the
flammiferous
boy
of
the
dim
past
a
legendary
creature
sole
kin
to
the
phoenix
it
had
been
impossible
that
he
should
ever
surpass
himself
in
the
artistry
that
was
from
the
outset
his
impossible
that
he
should
bring
forth
rhythms
lovelier
and
greater
than
those
early
rhythms
or
exercise
over
them
a
mastery
more
than
absolute
also
it
had
been
impossible
that
the
first
wild
ardour
of
spirit
should
abide
unsinkingly
in
him
youth
goes
and
there
was
not
in
swinburne
that
basis
on
which
a
man
may
in
his
maturity
so
build
as
to
make
good
in
some
degree
the
loss
of
what
is
gone
he
was
not
a
thinker
his
mind
rose
ever
away
from
reason
to
rhapsody
neither
was
he
human
he
was
a
king
crowned
but
not
throned
he
was
a
singing
bird
that
could
build
no
nest
he
was
a
youth
who
could
not
afford
to
age
had
he
died
young
literature
would
have
lost
many
glories
but
none
so
great
as
the
glories
he
had
already
given
nor
any
such
as
we
should
fondly
imagine
ourselves
bereft
of
by
his
early
death
a
great
part
of
keats
fame
rests
on
our
assumption
of
what
he
would
have
done
but
even
granting
that
keats
may
have
had
in
him
more
than
had
swinburne
of
stuff
for
development
i
believe
that
had
he
lived
on
we
should
think
of
him
as
author
of
the
poems
that
in
fact
we
know
not
philosophy
after
all
not
humanity
just
sheer
joyous
power
of
song
is
the
primal
thing
in
poetry
ideas
and
flesh
and
blood
are
but
reserves
to
be
brought
up
when
the
poet
s
youth
is
going
when
the
bird
can
no
longer
sing
in
flight
let
the
nest
be
ready
after
the
king
has
dazzled
us
with
his
crown
let
him
have
something
to
sit
down
on
but
the
session
on
throne
or
in
nest
is
not
the
divine
period
had
swinburne
s
genius
been
of
the
kind
that
solidifies
he
would
yet
at
the
close
of
the
nineteenth
century
have
been
for
us
young
men
virtually
though
not
so
definitely
as
in
fact
he
was
the
writer
of
atalanta
in
calydon
and
of
poems
and
tennyson
s
death
in
had
not
taken
us
at
all
by
surprise
we
had
been
fully
aware
that
he
was
alive
he
had
always
been
careful
to
keep
himself
abreast
of
the
times
anything
that
came
along
the
nebular
hypothesis
at
one
moment
the
imperial
institute
at
another
won
mention
from
his
muse
he
had
husbanded
for
his
old
age
that
which
he
had
long
ago
inherited
middle
age
if
in
our
mourning
for
him
there
really
was
any
tincture
of
surprise
this
was
due
to
merely
the
vague
sense
that
he
had
in
the
fullness
of
time
died
rather
prematurely
his
might
have
been
expected
to
go
on
flourishing
for
ever
but
assuredly
tennyson
dead
laid
no
such
strain
on
our
fancy
as
swinburne
living
it
is
true
that
swinburne
did
from
time
to
time
take
public
notice
of
current
affairs
but
what
notice
he
took
did
but
seem
to
mark
his
remoteness
from
them
from
us
the
boers
i
remember
were
the
theme
of
a
sonnet
which
embarrassed
even
their
angriest
enemies
in
our
midst
he
likened
them
if
i
remember
rightly
to
foaming
at
the
this
was
by
some
people
taken
as
a
sign
that
he
had
fallen
away
from
that
high
generosity
of
spirit
which
had
once
been
his
to
me
it
meant
merely
that
he
thought
of
poor
little
england
writhing
under
the
heel
of
an
alien
despotism
just
as
in
the
days
when
he
really
was
interested
in
such
matters
poor
little
italy
had
writhen
i
suspect
too
that
the
first
impulse
to
write
about
the
boers
came
not
from
the
muse
within
but
from
theodore
without
now
algernon
we
re
at
war
you
know
at
war
with
the
boers
i
don
t
want
to
bother
you
at
all
but
i
do
think
my
dear
old
friend
you
oughtn
t
to
let
slip
this
opportunity
of
etc
some
such
hortation
is
easily
imaginable
by
any
one
who
saw
the
two
old
friends
together
the
first
time
i
had
this
honour
this
sight
for
lasting
and
affectionate
memory
must
have
been
in
the
spring
of
in
those
days
theodore
watts
he
had
but
recently
taken
on
the
dunton
was
still
something
of
a
i
had
met
him
here
and
there
he
had
said
in
his
stentorian
tones
pleasant
things
to
me
about
my
writing
i
sent
him
a
new
little
book
of
mine
and
in
acknowledging
this
he
asked
me
to
come
down
to
putney
and
have
luncheon
and
meet
meet
catullus
on
the
day
appointed
i
came
as
one
whose
feet
half
it
is
but
a
few
steps
from
the
in
putney
high
street
to
no
the
pines
i
had
expected
a
greater
distance
to
the
sanctuary
a
walk
in
which
to
compose
my
mind
and
prepare
myself
for
initiation
i
laid
my
hand
irresolutely
against
the
gate
of
the
bleak
trim
i
withdrew
my
hand
i
went
away
out
here
were
all
the
aspects
of
common
modern
life
in
there
was
swinburne
a
went
by
whistling
he
was
not
going
to
see
swinburne
he
could
afford
to
whistle
i
pursued
my
dilatory
course
up
the
slope
of
putney
but
at
length
it
occurred
to
me
that
unpunctuality
would
after
all
be
an
imperfect
expression
of
reverence
and
i
retraced
my
footsteps
no
prosaic
inscription
but
as
that
closed
behind
me
i
had
the
instant
sense
of
having
slipped
away
from
the
harsh
light
of
the
ordinary
and
contemporary
into
the
dimness
of
an
odd
august
past
here
in
this
dark
hall
the
past
was
the
present
here
loomed
vivid
and
vital
on
the
walls
those
women
of
rossetti
whom
i
had
known
but
as
shades
familiar
to
me
in
small
reproductions
by
photogravure
here
they
themselves
were
with
lips
and
amorous
hair
done
in
the
original
warm
crayon
all
of
them
intently
looking
down
on
me
while
i
took
off
my
overcoat
all
wondering
who
was
this
intruder
from
posterity
that
they
hung
in
the
hall
evidently
no
more
than
an
overflow
was
an
earnest
of
packed
plenitude
within
the
room
i
was
ushered
into
was
a
a
looking
on
to
a
good
garden
it
was
in
form
and
fixtures
an
inalienably
room
and
held
its
stolid
own
in
the
riot
of
rossettis
its
proportions
its
bisecting
the
view
of
garden
its
through
which
i
heard
the
voice
of
booming
mysteriously
in
the
front
room
its
its
all
proclaimed
that
nothing
ever
would
seduce
them
from
their
allegiance
to
martin
tupper
nor
me
from
mine
said
the
sturdy
on
the
long
expanse
of
the
voice
of
ceased
suddenly
and
a
few
moments
later
its
owner
appeared
he
had
been
dictating
he
explained
a
great
deal
of
work
on
hand
just
now
a
great
deal
of
i
remember
that
on
my
subsequent
visits
he
was
always
at
the
moment
of
my
arrival
dictating
and
always
greeted
me
with
that
phrase
a
great
deal
of
work
on
hand
just
i
used
to
wonder
what
work
it
was
for
he
published
little
enough
but
i
never
ventured
to
inquire
and
indeed
rather
cherished
the
mystery
it
was
a
part
of
the
dear
little
old
man
it
went
with
the
something
about
his
swarthiness
and
chubbiness
went
with
the
shaggy
hair
that
fell
over
the
collar
of
his
eternally
crumpled
the
shaggy
eyebrows
that
overhung
his
bright
little
brown
eyes
the
shaggy
moustache
that
hid
his
small
round
chin
it
was
a
mystery
inherent
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
pines
while
i
stood
talking
to
talking
as
loudly
as
he
for
he
was
very
deaf
i
enjoyed
the
thrill
of
suspense
in
watching
the
door
through
which
would
appear
swinburne
i
asked
after
swinburne
s
health
said
it
was
very
good
he
always
goes
out
for
his
long
walk
in
the
morning
wonderfully
active
active
in
mind
too
but
i
m
afraid
you
won
t
be
able
to
get
into
touch
with
him
he
s
almost
poor
fellow
almost
he
changed
the
subject
and
i
felt
i
must
be
careful
not
to
seem
interested
in
swinburne
exclusively
i
spoke
of
the
parlourmaid
brought
in
the
hot
dishes
the
great
moment
was
at
hand
nor
was
i
disappointed
swinburne
s
entry
was
for
me
a
great
moment
here
suddenly
visible
in
the
flesh
was
the
legendary
being
and
divine
singer
here
he
was
shutting
the
door
behind
him
as
might
anybody
else
and
advancing
a
strange
small
figure
in
grey
having
an
air
at
once
noble
and
roguish
proud
and
skittish
my
name
was
roared
to
him
in
shaking
his
hand
i
bowed
low
of
course
a
bow
de
coeur
and
he
in
the
old
aristocratic
manner
bowed
equally
low
but
with
such
swiftness
that
we
narrowly
escaped
concussion
you
do
not
usually
associate
a
man
of
genius
when
you
see
one
with
any
social
class
and
swinburne
being
of
an
aspect
so
unrelated
as
it
was
to
any
species
of
human
kind
i
wondered
the
more
that
almost
the
first
impression
he
made
on
me
or
would
make
on
any
one
was
that
of
a
very
great
gentleman
indeed
not
of
an
old
gentleman
either
sparse
and
straggling
though
the
grey
hair
was
that
fringed
the
immense
pale
dome
of
his
head
and
venerably
haloed
though
he
was
for
me
by
his
greatness
there
was
yet
about
him
something
boyish
girlish
childish
rather
something
of
a
beautifully
child
but
he
had
the
eyes
of
a
god
and
the
smile
of
an
elf
in
figure
at
first
glance
he
seemed
almost
fat
but
this
was
merely
because
of
the
way
he
carried
himself
with
his
long
neck
strained
so
tightly
back
that
he
all
receded
from
the
waist
upwards
i
noticed
afterwards
that
this
deportment
made
the
back
of
his
jacket
hang
quite
far
away
from
his
legs
and
so
small
and
sloping
were
his
shoulders
that
the
jacket
seemed
ever
so
likely
to
slip
right
off
i
became
aware
too
that
when
he
bowed
he
did
not
unbend
his
back
but
only
his
neck
the
length
of
the
neck
accounting
for
the
depth
of
the
bow
his
hands
were
tiny
even
for
his
size
and
they
fluttered
helplessly
touchingly
unceasingly
directly
after
my
introduction
we
sat
down
to
the
meal
of
course
i
had
never
hoped
to
get
into
touch
with
him
reciprocally
quite
apart
from
his
deafness
i
was
too
modest
to
suppose
he
could
be
interested
in
anything
i
might
say
but
for
i
knew
he
had
once
been
as
high
and
copious
a
singer
in
talk
as
in
verse
i
had
hoped
to
hear
utterances
from
him
and
it
did
not
seem
that
my
hope
was
to
be
fulfilled
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
a
huge
and
very
tupperesque
joint
of
roast
mutton
in
front
of
him
swinburne
and
myself
close
up
to
him
on
either
side
he
talked
only
to
me
this
was
the
more
tantalising
because
swinburne
seemed
as
though
he
were
bubbling
over
with
all
sorts
of
notions
not
that
he
looked
at
either
of
us
he
smiled
only
to
himself
and
to
his
plateful
of
meat
and
to
the
small
bottle
of
bass
s
pale
ale
that
stood
before
him
ultimate
allowance
of
one
who
had
erst
clashed
cymbals
in
naxos
this
small
bottle
he
eyed
often
and
with
enthusiasm
seeming
to
waver
between
the
rapture
of
broaching
it
now
and
the
grandeur
of
having
it
to
look
forward
to
it
made
me
unhappy
to
see
what
trouble
he
had
in
managing
his
knife
and
fork
told
me
on
another
occasion
that
this
infirmity
of
the
hands
had
been
lifelong
had
begun
before
eton
days
the
swinburne
family
had
been
alarmed
by
it
and
had
consulted
a
specialist
who
said
that
it
resulted
from
an
excess
of
electric
vitality
and
that
any
attempt
to
stop
it
would
be
harmful
so
they
had
let
it
be
i
have
known
no
man
of
genius
who
had
not
to
pay
in
some
affliction
or
defect
either
physical
or
spiritual
for
what
the
gods
had
given
him
here
in
this
fluttering
of
his
tiny
hands
was
a
part
of
the
price
that
swinburne
had
to
pay
no
doubt
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
many
lustres
before
i
met
him
and
i
need
not
have
felt
at
all
unhappy
at
what
i
tried
not
to
see
he
evidently
was
quite
gay
in
his
silence
and
in
the
world
that
was
for
him
silent
i
had
however
the
maddening
suspicion
that
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
why
wouldn
t
roar
him
an
opportunity
i
felt
i
had
been
right
perhaps
in
feeling
that
the
lesser
man
was
no
not
jealous
of
the
greater
whom
he
had
guarded
so
long
and
with
such
love
but
anxious
that
he
himself
should
be
as
fully
impressive
to
visitors
as
his
fine
gifts
warranted
not
indeed
that
he
monopolised
the
talk
he
seemed
to
regard
me
as
a
source
of
information
about
all
the
latest
movements
and
i
had
to
shout
banalities
while
he
munched
his
mutton
banalities
whose
one
saving
grace
for
me
was
that
they
were
inaudible
to
swinburne
had
i
met
swinburne
s
gaze
i
should
have
faltered
now
and
again
his
shining
eyes
roved
from
the
table
darting
this
way
and
that
across
the
room
up
at
the
ceiling
out
of
the
window
only
never
at
us
somehow
this
aloofness
gave
no
hint
of
indifference
it
seemed
to
be
rather
a
point
in
good
manners
the
good
manners
of
a
child
sitting
up
to
table
not
staring
not
asking
questions
and
reflecting
great
credit
on
its
invaluable
old
nurse
the
child
sat
happy
in
the
wealth
of
its
inner
life
the
child
was
content
not
to
speak
until
it
were
spoken
to
but
but
i
felt
it
did
want
to
be
spoken
to
and
at
length
it
was
so
soon
as
the
mutton
had
been
replaced
by
the
leaned
forward
and
well
algernon
he
roared
how
was
it
on
the
heath
swinburne
who
had
meekly
inclined
his
ear
to
the
question
now
threw
back
his
head
uttering
a
sound
that
was
like
the
cooing
of
a
dove
and
forthwith
rapidly
ever
so
musically
he
spoke
to
us
of
his
walk
spoke
not
in
the
strain
of
a
man
who
had
been
taking
his
daily
exercise
on
putney
heath
but
rather
in
that
of
a
peri
who
had
at
long
last
been
suffered
to
pass
through
paradise
and
rather
than
that
he
spoke
would
i
say
that
he
cooingly
and
flutingly
sang
of
his
experience
the
wonders
of
this
morning
s
wind
and
sun
and
clouds
were
expressed
in
a
flow
of
words
so
right
and
sentences
so
perfectly
balanced
that
they
would
have
seemed
pedantic
had
they
not
been
clearly
as
spontaneous
as
the
wordless
notes
of
a
bird
in
song
the
frail
sweet
voice
rose
and
fell
lingered
quickened
in
all
manner
of
trills
and
roulades
that
he
himself
could
not
hear
it
seemed
to
me
the
greatest
loss
his
deafness
inflicted
on
him
one
would
have
expected
this
disability
to
mar
the
music
but
it
didn
t
save
that
now
and
again
a
note
would
come
out
metallic
and
the
tones
were
under
good
control
the
whole
manner
and
method
had
certainly
a
strong
element
of
oddness
but
no
one
incapable
of
condemning
as
unmanly
the
song
of
a
lark
would
have
called
it
affected
i
had
met
young
men
of
whose
enunciation
swinburne
s
now
reminded
me
in
them
the
thing
had
always
irritated
me
very
much
and
i
now
became
sure
that
it
had
been
derived
from
people
who
had
derived
it
in
old
balliol
days
from
swinburne
himself
one
of
the
points
familiar
to
me
in
such
enunciation
was
the
habit
of
stressing
extremely
and
lackadaisically
dwelling
on
some
particular
syllable
in
swinburne
this
trick
was
delightful
because
it
wasn
t
a
trick
but
a
need
of
his
heart
well
do
i
remember
his
ecstasy
of
emphasis
and
immensity
of
pause
when
he
described
how
he
had
seen
in
a
perambulator
on
the
heath
the
most
beaut
iful
babbie
ever
beheld
by
mortal
for
babies
as
some
of
his
later
volumes
testify
he
had
a
sort
of
idolatry
after
mazzini
had
followed
landor
to
elysium
and
victor
hugo
had
followed
mazzini
babies
were
what
among
live
creatures
most
evoked
swinburne
s
genius
for
his
rapture
about
this
especial
babbie
was
such
as
to
shake
within
me
my
hitherto
firm
conviction
that
whereas
the
young
of
the
brute
creation
are
already
beautiful
at
the
age
of
five
minutes
the
human
young
never
begin
to
be
so
before
the
age
of
three
years
i
suspect
of
having
shared
my
lack
of
innate
enthusiasm
but
it
was
one
of
swinburne
s
charms
as
i
was
to
find
that
he
took
for
granted
every
one
s
delight
in
what
he
himself
so
fervidly
delighted
in
he
could
as
soon
have
imagined
a
man
not
loving
the
very
sea
as
not
doting
on
the
aspect
of
babies
and
not
reading
at
least
one
play
by
an
elizabethan
or
jacobean
dramatist
every
day
i
forget
whether
it
was
at
this
my
first
meal
or
at
another
that
he
described
a
storm
in
which
one
night
years
ago
with
he
had
crossed
the
channel
the
rhythm
of
his
great
phrases
was
as
the
rhythm
of
those
waves
and
his
head
swayed
in
accordance
to
it
like
the
boat
itself
he
hymned
in
memory
the
surge
and
darkness
the
thunder
and
foam
and
phosphorescence
you
remember
theodore
you
remember
the
phos
phorescence
all
so
beautifully
and
vividly
that
i
almost
felt
stormbound
and
in
peril
of
my
life
to
disentangle
one
from
another
of
the
several
occasions
on
which
i
heard
him
talk
is
difficult
because
the
procedure
was
so
invariable
always
dictating
when
i
arrived
swinburne
always
appearing
at
the
moment
of
the
meal
always
the
same
simple
and
substantial
fare
swinburne
never
allowed
to
talk
before
the
meal
was
half
over
as
to
this
last
point
i
soon
realised
that
i
had
been
quite
unjust
in
suspecting
of
selfishness
it
was
simply
a
sign
of
the
care
with
which
he
watched
over
his
friend
s
welfare
had
swinburne
been
admitted
earlier
to
the
talk
he
would
not
have
taken
his
proper
quantity
of
roast
mutton
so
soon
always
as
he
had
taken
that
the
embargo
was
removed
the
chance
was
given
him
and
swiftly
though
he
embraced
the
chance
and
much
though
he
made
of
it
in
the
courses
of
and
of
cheese
he
seemed
touchingly
ashamed
of
holding
often
before
he
had
said
his
really
full
say
on
the
theme
suggested
by
s
loud
interrogation
he
would
curb
his
speech
and
try
to
eliminate
himself
bowing
his
head
over
his
plate
and
then
when
he
had
promptly
been
brought
in
again
he
would
always
try
to
atone
for
his
inhibiting
deafness
by
much
reference
and
deference
to
all
that
we
might
otherwise
have
to
say
i
hope
he
would
coo
to
me
my
friend
who
and
here
he
would
turn
and
make
a
little
bow
to
is
himself
a
scholar
will
bear
me
out
when
i
say
or
i
hardly
know
he
would
flute
to
his
old
friend
whether
beerbohm
here
a
bow
to
me
will
agree
with
me
in
my
opinion
of
some
delicate
point
in
greek
prosody
or
some
incident
in
an
old
french
romance
i
had
never
heard
of
on
one
occasion
just
before
the
removal
of
the
mutton
had
been
asking
me
about
an
english
translation
that
had
been
made
of
rostand
s
cyrano
de
he
then
took
my
information
as
the
match
to
ignite
the
swinburnian
tinder
well
algernon
it
seems
that
cyrano
de
bergerac
but
this
first
spark
was
enough
instantly
swinburne
was
praising
the
works
of
cyrano
de
bergerac
of
rostand
he
may
have
heard
but
him
he
forgot
indeed
i
never
heard
swinburne
mention
a
single
contemporary
writer
his
mind
ranged
and
revelled
always
in
the
illustrious
or
obscure
past
to
him
the
writings
of
cyrano
de
bergerac
were
as
fresh
as
paint
as
fresh
as
to
me
alas
was
the
news
of
their
survival
of
course
of
course
you
have
read
l
histoire
comique
des
états
et
des
empires
de
la
lune
i
admitted
by
gesture
and
facial
expression
that
i
had
not
whereupon
he
reeled
out
curious
extracts
from
that
allegory
almost
as
good
as
gulliver
with
a
memorable
instance
of
the
way
in
which
the
traveller
to
the
moon
was
shocked
by
the
conversation
of
the
natives
and
the
natives
sense
of
propriety
was
outraged
by
the
conversation
of
the
traveller
in
life
as
in
that
for
him
more
truly
actual
thing
literature
it
was
always
the
preterit
that
enthralled
him
of
any
passing
events
of
anything
the
newspapers
were
full
of
never
a
word
from
him
and
i
should
have
been
sorry
if
there
had
been
but
i
did
through
the
medium
of
sometimes
start
him
on
topics
that
might
have
led
him
to
talk
of
rossetti
and
other
old
comrades
for
me
the
names
of
those
men
breathed
the
magic
of
the
past
just
as
it
was
breathed
for
me
by
swinburne
s
presence
for
him
i
suppose
they
were
but
a
bit
of
the
present
and
the
mere
fact
that
they
had
dropped
out
of
it
was
not
enough
to
hallow
them
he
never
mentioned
them
but
i
was
glad
to
see
that
he
revelled
as
wistfully
in
the
days
just
before
his
own
as
i
in
the
days
just
before
mine
he
recounted
to
us
things
he
had
been
told
in
his
boyhood
by
an
aged
aunt
or
one
of
the
ashburnhams
how
for
example
she
had
been
taken
by
her
mother
to
a
county
ball
a
distance
of
many
miles
and
on
the
way
home
through
the
frosty
and
snowy
night
the
had
suddenly
stopped
there
was
a
crowd
of
dark
figures
in
the
way
at
which
point
swinburne
stopped
too
before
saying
with
an
ineffable
smile
and
in
a
voice
faint
with
appreciation
they
were
burying
a
suicide
at
the
vivid
as
this
hogarthian
was
to
me
i
saw
beside
it
another
scene
a
great
panelled
room
a
grim
old
woman
in
a
chair
and
restless
on
a
stool
at
her
feet
an
extraordinary
little
nephew
with
masses
of
auburn
hair
and
with
tiny
hands
clasped
in
supplication
tell
me
more
aunt
ashburnham
tell
me
more
and
now
clearlier
still
as
i
write
in
these
do
i
see
that
of
the
pines
the
long
white
stretch
of
with
swinburne
and
and
another
at
the
extreme
end
of
it
between
us
very
low
down
over
his
plate
very
cosy
and
hirsute
and
rather
like
the
dormouse
at
that
long
which
alice
found
in
wonderland
i
see
myself
sitting
there
as
alice
sat
and
had
the
hare
been
a
great
poet
and
the
hatter
a
great
gentleman
and
neither
of
them
mad
but
each
only
very
odd
and
vivacious
i
might
see
swinburne
as
a
glorified
blend
of
those
two
when
the
meal
ended
for
alas
it
was
not
like
that
meal
in
wonderland
unending
swinburne
would
dart
round
the
table
proffer
his
hand
to
me
bow
deeply
bow
to
also
and
disappear
he
always
walks
in
the
morning
writes
in
the
afternoon
and
reads
in
the
evening
would
say
with
a
touch
of
tutorial
pride
in
this
regimen
that
parting
bow
of
swinburne
to
his
old
friend
was
characteristic
of
his
whole
relation
to
him
cronies
though
they
were
these
two
knit
together
with
bonds
innumerable
the
greater
man
was
always
aux
petits
soins
for
the
lesser
treating
him
as
a
young
guest
might
treat
an
elderly
host
some
twenty
years
had
passed
since
that
night
when
ailing
and
broken
thought
to
be
nearly
dying
told
me
swinburne
was
brought
in
a
to
the
pines
regular
private
either
did
not
exist
in
those
days
or
were
less
in
vogue
than
they
are
now
the
pines
was
to
be
a
sort
of
private
for
swinburne
it
was
a
good
one
he
recovered
he
was
most
grateful
to
his
friend
and
saviour
he
made
as
though
to
depart
was
persuaded
to
stay
a
little
longer
and
then
a
little
longer
than
that
but
i
rather
fancy
that
to
the
last
he
never
did
in
the
fullness
of
his
modesty
and
good
manners
consent
to
regard
his
presence
as
a
matter
of
course
or
as
anything
but
a
terminable
intrusion
and
obligation
his
bow
seemed
always
to
convey
that
swinburne
having
gone
from
the
room
in
would
come
the
parlourmaid
the
table
was
cleared
the
fire
was
stirred
two
leather
were
pushed
up
to
the
hearth
wanted
gossip
of
the
present
i
wanted
gossip
of
the
great
past
we
settled
down
for
a
long
comfortable
afternoon
together
only
once
was
the
ritual
varied
swinburne
i
was
told
before
luncheon
had
expressed
a
wish
to
show
me
his
library
so
after
the
meal
he
did
not
bid
us
his
usual
adieu
but
with
much
courtesy
invited
us
and
led
the
way
up
the
staircase
he
then
literally
bounded
three
literally
three
stairs
at
a
time
i
began
to
follow
at
the
same
rate
but
immediately
slackened
speed
for
fear
that
behind
us
might
be
embittered
at
sight
of
so
much
youth
and
legerity
swinburne
waited
on
the
threshold
to
receive
us
as
it
were
and
pass
us
in
went
and
ensconced
himself
snugly
in
a
corner
the
sun
had
appeared
after
a
grey
morning
and
it
pleasantly
flooded
this
big
whose
walls
were
entirely
lined
with
the
mellow
backs
of
books
here
as
host
among
his
treasures
swinburne
was
more
than
ever
attractive
he
was
as
happy
as
was
any
mote
in
the
sunshine
about
him
and
the
fluttering
of
his
little
hands
and
feet
too
was
but
as
a
token
of
so
much
felicity
he
looked
older
it
is
true
in
the
strong
light
but
these
added
years
made
only
more
notable
his
youngness
of
heart
an
illustrious
bibliophile
among
his
books
a
birthday
child
rather
among
his
toys
proudly
he
explained
to
me
the
general
system
under
which
the
volumes
were
ranged
in
this
or
that
division
of
shelves
then
he
conducted
me
to
a
chair
near
the
window
left
me
there
flew
away
flew
up
the
rungs
of
a
mahogany
ladder
plucked
a
small
volume
and
in
a
twinkling
was
at
my
side
this
i
think
will
please
you
it
did
it
had
a
beautifully
engraved
and
a
pleasing
scent
of
old
old
leather
it
was
editio
princeps
of
a
play
by
some
lesser
elizabethan
or
jacobean
of
course
you
know
it
my
host
fluted
how
i
wished
i
could
say
that
i
knew
it
and
loved
it
well
i
revealed
to
him
for
by
speaking
very
loudly
towards
his
inclined
head
i
was
able
to
make
him
hear
that
i
had
not
read
it
he
envied
any
one
who
had
such
pleasure
in
store
he
darted
to
the
ladder
and
came
back
thrusting
gently
into
my
hands
another
volume
of
like
date
of
course
you
know
this
again
i
had
to
confess
that
i
did
not
and
to
shout
my
appreciation
of
the
fount
of
type
the
margins
the
binding
he
beamed
agreement
and
fetched
another
volume
archly
he
indicated
the
title
cooing
you
are
a
lover
of
this
i
hope
and
again
i
was
shamed
by
my
inexperience
i
did
not
pretend
to
know
this
particular
play
but
my
tone
implied
that
i
had
always
been
meaning
to
read
it
and
had
always
by
some
mischance
been
prevented
for
his
sake
as
well
as
my
own
i
did
want
to
acquit
myself
passably
i
wanted
for
him
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
joys
shared
by
a
representative
however
humble
of
the
common
world
i
turned
the
leaves
caressingly
looking
from
them
to
him
while
he
dilated
on
the
beauty
of
this
and
that
scene
in
the
play
anon
he
fetched
another
volume
and
another
always
with
the
same
faith
that
this
was
a
favourite
of
mine
i
quibbled
i
evaded
i
was
very
enthusiastic
and
uncomfortable
it
was
with
intense
relief
that
i
beheld
the
of
yet
another
volume
which
silently
this
time
he
laid
before
me
the
country
wench
this
of
course
i
have
read
i
heartily
shouted
swinburne
stepped
back
you
have
you
have
read
it
where
he
cried
in
evident
dismay
something
was
wrong
had
i
not
i
quickly
wondered
read
this
play
oh
yes
i
shouted
i
have
read
but
when
where
entreated
swinburne
adding
that
he
had
supposed
it
to
be
the
sole
copy
extant
i
floundered
i
wildly
said
i
thought
i
must
have
read
it
years
ago
in
the
bodleian
theodore
do
you
hear
this
it
seems
that
they
have
now
a
copy
of
the
country
wench
in
the
bodleian
beerbohm
found
one
there
oh
when
in
what
year
he
appealed
to
me
i
said
it
might
have
been
six
seven
eight
years
ago
swinburne
knew
for
certain
that
no
copy
had
been
there
twelve
years
ago
and
was
surprised
that
he
had
not
heard
of
the
acquisition
they
might
have
told
me
he
wailed
i
sacrificed
myself
on
the
altar
of
sympathy
i
admitted
that
i
might
have
been
mistaken
must
have
been
must
have
confused
this
play
with
some
other
i
dipped
into
the
pages
and
no
i
shouted
this
i
have
never
his
equanimity
was
restored
he
was
up
the
ladder
and
down
again
showing
me
further
treasures
with
all
pride
and
ardour
at
length
afraid
that
his
old
friend
would
tire
himself
arose
from
his
corner
and
presently
he
and
i
went
downstairs
to
the
it
was
in
the
course
of
our
session
together
that
there
suddenly
flashed
across
my
mind
the
existence
of
a
play
called
the
country
wife
by
wasn
t
it
wycherley
i
had
once
read
it
or
read
something
about
it
but
this
matter
i
kept
to
myself
i
thought
i
had
appeared
fool
enough
already
i
loved
those
sessions
in
that
tupperossettine
lair
of
solid
old
comfort
and
fervid
old
romanticism
its
odd
duality
befitted
well
its
owner
the
distinguished
critic
and
poet
rossetti
s
closest
friend
and
swinburne
s
had
been
for
a
while
in
the
dark
ages
a
solicitor
and
one
felt
he
had
been
a
good
one
his
though
the
muses
had
crumpled
it
inspired
confidence
in
his
judgment
of
other
things
than
verse
but
let
there
be
no
mistake
he
was
no
mere
bourgeois
parnassien
as
his
enemies
insinuated
no
doubt
he
had
been
very
useful
to
men
of
genius
in
virtue
of
qualities
they
lacked
but
the
secret
of
his
hold
on
them
was
in
his
own
rich
nature
he
was
not
only
a
born
man
of
letters
he
was
a
deeply
emotional
human
being
whose
appeal
was
as
much
to
the
heart
as
to
the
head
the
romantic
celtic
mysticism
of
aylwin
with
its
lack
of
fashionable
celtic
nebulosity
lends
itself
if
you
will
to
laughter
though
personally
i
saw
nothing
funny
in
it
it
seemed
to
me
before
i
was
in
touch
with
the
author
a
work
of
genuine
expression
from
within
and
that
it
truly
was
so
i
presently
knew
the
mysticism
of
who
once
comfortably
settled
at
the
fireside
knew
no
reserve
was
in
contrast
with
the
and
the
practical
abilities
but
it
was
essential
and
they
were
of
the
surface
for
humorous
rossetti
i
daresay
the
very
contrast
made
theodore
s
company
the
more
precious
he
himself
had
assuredly
been
and
the
memory
of
him
still
was
the
in
s
life
algernon
was
as
an
adopted
child
gabriel
as
a
only
brother
as
he
was
to
the
outer
world
of
his
own
day
so
too
to
posterity
rossetti
the
man
is
conjectural
and
mysterious
we
know
that
he
was
in
his
prime
the
most
inspiring
and
splendid
of
companions
but
we
know
this
only
by
faith
the
evidence
is
as
vague
as
it
is
emphatic
of
the
style
and
substance
of
not
a
few
great
talkers
in
the
past
we
can
piece
together
some
more
or
less
vivid
and
probably
erroneous
notion
but
about
rossetti
nothing
has
been
recorded
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
him
even
faintly
emerge
i
suppose
he
had
in
him
what
reviewers
seem
to
find
so
often
in
books
a
quality
that
defies
analysis
listening
to
i
was
always
in
hope
that
when
next
the
turned
up
for
he
was
continually
doing
so
in
the
talk
i
should
see
him
hear
him
and
share
the
rapture
but
the
revelation
was
not
to
be
you
might
think
that
to
hear
him
called
gabriel
would
have
given
me
a
sense
of
propinquity
but
i
felt
no
nearer
to
him
than
you
feel
to
the
archangel
who
bears
that
name
and
no
surname
it
was
always
when
spoke
carelessly
casually
of
some
to
me
illustrious
figure
in
the
past
that
i
had
the
sense
of
being
wafted
right
into
that
past
and
plumped
down
in
the
very
midst
of
it
when
he
spoke
with
reverence
of
this
and
that
great
man
whom
he
had
known
he
did
not
thus
waft
and
plump
me
for
i
too
revered
those
names
but
i
had
the
magical
transition
whenever
one
of
the
immortals
was
mentioned
in
the
tone
of
those
who
knew
him
before
he
had
put
on
immortality
browning
for
example
was
a
name
deeply
honoured
by
me
browning
yes
said
in
the
course
of
an
afternoon
browning
and
he
took
a
sip
of
the
steaming
that
was
a
point
in
our
day
s
ritual
i
was
a
great
in
the
old
times
i
used
to
dine
out
every
night
in
the
week
browning
was
a
great
too
we
were
always
meeting
what
a
pity
he
went
on
writing
all
those
plays
he
hadn
t
any
gift
for
drama
none
i
never
could
understand
why
he
took
to
he
wagged
his
head
gazing
regretfully
into
the
fire
and
added
such
a
clever
fellow
too
whistler
though
alive
and
about
was
already
looked
to
as
a
hierarch
by
the
young
not
so
had
he
been
looked
to
by
rossetti
the
thrill
of
the
past
was
always
strong
in
me
when
mentioned
seldom
without
a
guffaw
did
he
mention
jimmy
i
think
he
put
in
the
surname
because
that
fellow
had
not
behaved
well
to
swinburne
but
he
could
not
omit
the
nickname
because
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
feel
the
right
measure
of
resentment
against
such
a
funny
as
of
old
hates
as
of
old
loves
was
and
i
take
it
as
high
testimony
to
the
charm
of
whistler
s
quaintness
that
did
not
hate
him
you
may
be
aware
that
swinburne
in
wrote
for
one
of
the
monthly
reviews
a
criticism
of
the
ten
o
clock
lecture
he
paid
courtly
compliments
to
whistler
as
a
painter
but
joined
issue
with
his
theories
straightway
there
appeared
in
the
world
a
little
letter
from
whistler
deriding
one
algernon
swinburne
outsider
it
was
not
in
itself
a
very
pretty
or
amusing
letter
and
still
less
so
did
it
seem
in
the
light
of
the
facts
which
told
me
in
some
such
words
as
these
after
he
d
published
that
lecture
of
his
jimmy
whistler
had
me
to
dine
with
him
at
kettner
s
or
somewhere
he
said
now
theodore
i
want
you
to
do
me
a
he
wanted
to
get
me
to
get
swinburne
to
write
an
article
about
his
lecture
i
said
no
jimmy
whistler
i
can
t
ask
algernon
to
do
that
he
s
got
a
great
deal
of
work
on
hand
just
now
a
great
deal
of
work
and
besides
this
sort
of
thing
wouldn
t
be
at
all
in
his
but
jimmy
whistler
went
on
appealing
to
me
he
said
it
would
do
him
no
end
of
good
if
swinburne
wrote
about
him
and
well
i
half
gave
in
i
said
perhaps
i
would
mention
the
matter
to
algernon
and
next
day
i
did
i
could
see
algernon
didn
t
want
to
do
it
at
all
but
well
there
he
said
he
d
do
it
to
please
me
and
he
did
it
and
then
jimmy
whistler
published
that
letter
a
very
shabby
trick
very
shabby
of
course
i
do
not
vouch
for
the
exact
words
in
which
told
me
this
tale
but
this
was
exactly
the
tale
he
told
me
i
expressed
my
astonishment
he
added
that
of
course
he
never
wanted
to
see
the
fellow
again
after
that
and
never
but
presently
after
a
long
gaze
into
the
coals
he
emitted
a
chuckle
as
for
earlier
memories
of
such
a
funny
one
quite
recent
memory
he
had
too
when
i
took
on
the
name
of
dunton
i
had
a
note
from
him
just
this
with
his
butterfly
signature
theodore
what
s
dunton
that
was
very
good
very
good
but
of
course
he
added
gravely
i
took
no
and
no
doubt
quite
apart
from
the
difficulty
of
finding
an
answer
in
the
same
vein
he
did
well
in
not
replying
loyalty
to
swinburne
forbade
but
i
see
a
certain
pathos
in
the
unanswered
message
it
was
a
message
from
the
hand
of
an
old
jester
but
also
i
think
from
the
heart
of
an
old
man
a
signal
waved
jauntily
but
in
truth
wistfully
across
the
gulf
of
years
and
estrangement
and
one
could
wish
it
had
not
been
ignored
some
time
after
whistler
died
i
wrote
for
one
of
the
magazines
an
appreciation
of
his
curious
skill
in
the
art
of
writing
told
me
he
had
heard
of
this
from
swinburne
i
myself
he
said
very
seldom
read
the
magazines
but
algernon
always
has
a
look
at
there
was
something
to
me
very
droll
and
cheery
too
in
this
picture
of
the
illustrious
recluse
snatching
at
the
current
issues
of
our
twaddle
and
i
was
immensely
pleased
at
hearing
that
my
article
had
interested
him
very
i
inwardly
promised
myself
that
as
soon
as
i
reached
home
i
would
read
the
article
to
see
just
how
it
might
have
struck
swinburne
when
in
due
course
i
did
this
i
regretted
the
tone
of
the
opening
sentences
in
which
i
declared
myself
no
and
avowed
a
preference
for
an
uninterrupted
view
of
my
i
felt
that
had
i
known
my
article
would
meet
the
eye
of
swinburne
i
should
have
cut
out
that
overture
i
dimly
remembered
a
fine
passage
in
one
of
his
books
of
criticism
something
i
preferred
not
to
verify
it
about
the
dotage
of
duncedom
which
can
not
perceive
or
the
impudence
of
insignificance
so
presumptuous
as
to
doubt
that
the
elements
of
life
and
literature
are
indivisibly
mingled
one
in
another
and
that
he
to
whom
books
are
less
real
than
life
will
assuredly
find
in
men
and
women
as
little
reality
as
in
his
accursed
crassness
he
deserves
to
i
quailed
i
quailed
but
mine
is
a
resilient
nature
and
i
promptly
reminded
myself
that
swinburne
s
was
a
very
impersonal
one
he
would
not
think
the
less
highly
of
me
for
he
never
had
thought
about
me
in
any
way
whatsoever
all
was
well
i
knew
i
could
revisit
the
pines
when
next
should
invite
me
without
misgiving
and
to
this
day
i
am
rather
proud
of
having
been
mentioned
though
not
by
name
and
not
consciously
and
unfavourably
by
swinburne
i
wonder
that
i
can
not
recall
more
than
i
do
recall
of
those
hours
at
the
pines
it
is
odd
how
little
remains
to
a
man
of
his
own
past
how
few
minutes
of
even
his
memorable
hours
are
not
clean
forgotten
and
how
few
seconds
in
any
one
of
those
minutes
can
be
recaptured
i
am
and
have
lived
a
vast
number
of
seconds
subtract
one
third
of
these
for
one
mustn
t
count
sleep
as
life
the
residual
number
is
still
enormous
not
a
single
one
of
those
seconds
was
unimportant
to
me
in
its
passage
many
of
them
bored
me
of
course
but
even
boredom
is
a
positive
state
one
chafes
at
it
and
hates
it
strange
that
one
should
afterwards
forget
it
and
stranger
still
that
of
one
s
actual
happinesses
and
unhappinesses
so
tiny
and
tattered
a
remnant
clings
about
one
of
those
hours
at
the
pines
of
that
past
within
a
past
there
was
not
a
minute
nor
a
second
that
i
did
not
spend
with
pleasure
memory
is
a
great
artist
we
are
told
she
selects
and
rejects
and
shapes
and
so
on
no
doubt
elderly
persons
would
be
utterly
intolerable
if
they
remembered
everything
everything
nevertheless
is
just
what
they
themselves
would
like
to
remember
and
just
what
they
would
like
to
tell
to
everybody
be
sure
that
the
ancient
mariner
though
he
remembered
quite
as
much
as
his
audience
wanted
to
hear
and
rather
more
about
the
albatross
and
the
ghastly
crew
was
inwardly
raging
at
the
sketchiness
of
his
own
mind
and
believe
me
that
his
stopping
only
one
of
three
was
the
merest
oversight
i
should
like
to
impose
on
the
world
many
tomes
about
the
pines
but
scant
though
my
memories
are
of
the
moments
there
very
full
and
warm
in
me
is
the
whole
fused
memory
of
the
two
dear
old
men
that
lived
there
i
wish
i
had
s
sure
faith
in
meetings
beyond
the
grave
i
am
glad
i
do
not
disbelieve
that
people
may
so
meet
i
like
to
think
that
some
day
in
elysium
i
shall
not
without
diffidence
approach
those
two
and
reintroduce
myself
i
can
see
just
how
courteously
swinburne
will
bow
over
my
hand
not
at
all
remembering
who
i
am
will
remember
me
after
a
moment
oh
to
be
sure
yes
indeed
i
ve
a
great
deal
of
work
on
hand
just
now
a
great
deal
of
work
but
we
shall
sit
down
together
on
the
asphodel
and
i
can
not
but
think
we
shall
have
even
there
he
will
not
have
changed
he
will
still
be
shaggy
and
old
and
chubby
and
will
wear
the
same
with
the
same
creases
in
it
swinburne
on
the
other
hand
will
be
quite
quite
young
with
a
full
mane
of
flaming
auburn
locks
and
no
clothes
to
hinder
him
from
plunging
back
at
any
moment
into
the
shining
elysian
waters
from
which
he
will
have
just
emerged
i
see
him
skim
lightly
away
into
that
element
on
the
strand
is
sitting
a
man
of
noble
and
furrowed
brow
it
is
mazzini
still
thinking
of
liberty
and
anon
the
tiny
young
english
amphibian
comes
ashore
to
fling
himself
dripping
at
the
feet
of
the
patriot
and
to
carol
the
republican
ode
he
has
composed
in
the
course
of
his
swim
he
s
wonderfully
active
active
in
mind
and
body
says
to
me
i
come
to
the
shore
now
and
then
just
to
see
how
he
s
getting
on
but
i
spend
most
of
my
time
inland
i
find
i
ve
so
much
to
talk
over
with
gabriel
not
that
he
s
quite
the
fellow
he
was
he
always
had
rather
a
cult
for
dante
you
know
and
now
he
s
more
than
ever
under
the
florentine
influence
he
lives
in
a
sort
of
monastery
that
dante
has
here
and
there
he
sits
painting
imaginary
portraits
of
beatrice
and
giving
them
all
to
dante
but
he
still
has
his
great
moments
and
there
s
no
one
quite
like
him
no
one
algernon
won
t
ever
come
and
see
him
because
that
fellow
mazzini
s
as
as
ever
and
makes
a
principle
of
having
nothing
to
do
with
dante
look
there
s
algernon
going
into
the
water
again
he
ll
tire
himself
out
he
ll
catch
cold
he
ll
and
here
the
old
man
rises
and
hurries
down
to
the
sea
s
edge
now
algernon
he
roars
i
don
t
want
to
interfere
with
you
but
i
do
think
my
dear
old
friend
and
then
with
a
guffaw
he
breaks
off
remembering
that
his
friend
is
not
deaf
now
nor
old
and
that
here
in
elysium
where
no
ills
are
good
advice
is
not
needed
a
letter
that
was
not
written
one
morning
lately
i
saw
in
my
newspaper
an
announcement
that
enraged
me
it
was
made
in
the
driest
most
casual
way
as
though
nobody
would
care
a
rap
and
this
did
but
whet
the
wrath
i
had
in
knowing
that
adam
street
adelphi
was
to
be
undone
the
tivoli
music
hall
about
to
be
demolished
and
built
anew
was
to
have
a
frontage
of
thirty
feet
if
you
please
in
adam
street
why
because
the
london
county
council
with
its
fixed
idea
that
the
happiness
of
mankind
depends
on
the
widening
of
the
strand
had
decreed
that
the
tivoli
s
new
frontage
thereon
should
be
thirty
feet
further
back
and
had
granted
as
consolation
to
the
tivoli
the
right
to
spread
itself
around
the
corner
and
wreck
the
work
of
the
brothers
adam
could
not
this
outrage
be
averted
there
sprang
from
my
lips
that
fiery
formula
which
has
sprung
from
the
lips
of
so
many
choleric
old
gentlemen
in
the
course
of
the
past
hundred
years
and
more
i
shall
write
to
the
if
adam
street
were
a
thing
apart
i
should
have
been
stricken
enough
heaven
knows
at
thought
of
its
beauty
going
its
dear
tradition
being
lost
but
not
as
an
unrelated
masterpiece
was
adam
street
built
by
the
brothers
whose
name
it
bears
an
integral
part
it
is
in
their
noble
design
of
the
adelphi
it
is
the
very
key
to
the
adelphi
the
initiation
for
us
into
that
small
matchless
quarter
of
london
where
peace
and
dignity
do
still
reign
peace
the
more
beatific
and
dignity
the
finer
by
instant
contrast
with
the
chaos
of
hideous
sounds
and
sights
hard
by
what
man
so
gross
that
passing
out
of
the
strand
into
adam
street
down
the
mild
slope
to
the
river
he
has
not
cursed
the
age
he
was
born
into
or
blessed
it
because
the
adelphi
can
not
in
earlier
days
have
had
for
any
one
this
fullness
of
peculiar
magic
adam
street
is
not
so
beautiful
as
the
serene
terrace
it
goes
down
to
nor
so
curiously
grand
as
john
street
but
the
brothers
did
not
mean
it
to
be
so
they
meant
it
just
as
an
harmonious
lead
to
those
inner
glories
of
their
scheme
ruin
that
approach
and
how
much
else
do
you
ruin
of
a
thing
which
done
perfectly
by
masters
and
done
by
them
here
as
nowhere
else
could
they
have
done
it
ought
to
be
guarded
by
us
very
jealously
how
to
raise
on
this
irregular
and
barbarous
ground
a
quarter
that
should
be
polite
congruous
in
tone
with
the
smooth
river
beyond
it
this
was
the
irresistible
problem
the
brothers
set
themselves
and
slowly
coolly
perfectly
solved
so
long
as
the
adelphi
remains
to
us
a
microcosm
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
ours
if
there
is
any
meaning
in
the
word
sacrilege
that
i
remember
was
the
beginning
of
one
of
the
sentences
i
composed
while
i
paced
my
room
thinking
out
my
letter
to
the
times
i
rejected
that
sentence
i
rejected
scores
of
others
they
were
all
too
vehement
though
my
facility
for
indignation
is
not
i
hope
less
than
that
of
my
fellows
i
never
had
written
to
the
times
and
now
though
i
flattered
myself
i
knew
how
the
thing
ought
to
be
done
i
was
unsure
that
i
could
do
it
was
i
beginning
too
late
restraint
was
the
prime
effect
to
be
aimed
at
if
you
are
intemperate
you
don
t
convince
i
wanted
to
convince
the
readers
of
the
times
that
the
violation
of
the
adelphi
was
a
thing
to
be
prevented
at
all
costs
soberness
of
statement
a
simple
direct
civic
style
with
only
an
underthrob
of
personal
emotion
were
what
i
must
at
all
costs
achieve
not
too
much
of
mere
aesthetics
either
nor
of
mere
sentiment
for
the
past
no
more
than
a
brief
eulogy
of
those
admirably
proportioned
streets
so
familiar
to
all
students
of
eighteenth
century
architecture
and
perhaps
a
passing
reference
to
the
shades
of
johnson
garrick
hannah
more
sir
joshua
reynolds
topham
beauclerk
and
how
many
others
the
sooner
my
protest
were
put
in
terms
of
commerce
the
better
for
my
cause
the
more
clearly
i
were
to
point
out
that
such
antiquities
as
the
adelphi
are
as
a
magnet
to
the
moneyed
tourists
of
america
and
europe
the
likelier
would
my
readers
be
to
shudder
at
a
proposal
which
if
carried
into
effect
will
bring
discredit
on
all
concerned
and
will
in
some
measure
justify
napoleon
s
taunt
that
we
are
a
nation
of
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant
good
i
sat
down
to
a
table
and
wrote
out
that
conclusion
and
then
i
worked
backwards
keeping
well
in
view
the
idea
of
but
that
quality
which
is
little
sister
to
restraint
and
is
yet
far
more
repulsive
to
the
public
mind
than
vehemence
emerged
to
misguide
my
pen
irony
in
fact
played
the
deuce
i
found
myself
writing
that
a
nation
which
in
its
ardour
for
beauty
and
its
reverence
for
great
historic
associations
has
lately
disbursed
after
only
a
few
months
hesitation
to
save
the
crystal
palace
where
the
bank
holidays
of
millions
of
toilers
have
been
spoilt
by
the
utter
gloom
and
nullity
of
the
place
a
nullity
and
gloom
that
will
however
and
of
course
be
dispelled
so
soon
as
the
place
is
devoted
to
permanent
exhibitions
of
new
zealand
pippins
rhodesian
tobacco
australian
mutton
canadian
and
other
glories
of
empire
might
surely
not
be
asked
in
vain
to
but
i
deleted
that
sentence
and
tried
another
in
another
vein
my
desire
to
be
straightforward
did
but
topple
me
into
excess
of
statement
my
sorrow
for
the
adelphi
came
out
as
sentimentality
my
anger
against
the
authorities
as
vulgar
abuse
only
the
urgency
of
my
cause
upheld
me
i
would
get
my
letter
done
somehow
and
post
it
but
there
flitted
through
my
mind
that
horrid
doubt
which
has
flitted
through
the
minds
of
so
many
choleric
old
gentlemen
in
the
course
of
the
past
hundred
years
and
more
will
the
times
put
my
letter
in
if
the
times
wouldn
t
what
then
at
least
my
conscience
would
be
clear
i
should
have
done
what
i
could
to
save
my
beloved
quarter
but
the
process
of
doing
it
was
hard
and
tedious
and
i
was
glad
of
the
little
respite
presented
by
the
thought
that
i
must
before
stating
my
case
thoroughly
revisit
adam
street
itself
to
gauge
precisely
the
extent
of
the
mischief
threatened
there
on
my
way
to
the
strand
i
met
an
old
friend
one
of
my
links
with
whom
is
his
love
of
the
adams
work
he
had
not
read
the
news
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
in
my
selfish
agitation
did
not
break
it
to
him
gently
rallying
he
accompanied
me
on
my
sombre
quest
i
had
forgotten
there
was
a
hosier
s
shop
next
to
the
tivoli
at
the
corner
of
the
side
of
adam
street
we
turned
past
it
and
were
both
of
us
rather
surprised
that
there
were
other
shops
down
that
side
they
ought
never
to
have
been
allowed
there
but
there
they
were
and
of
course
i
felt
it
was
the
old
facades
above
them
that
really
counted
we
gazed
meanwhile
at
the
facades
on
the
side
feasting
our
eyes
on
the
proportions
of
the
pilasters
the
windows
the
old
seemly
elegance
of
it
all
the
greatness
of
the
manner
with
the
sweet
smallness
of
the
scale
it
wrought
on
well
i
said
turning
abruptly
away
to
business
thirty
feet
how
much
about
is
that
my
friend
moved
to
the
exact
corner
of
the
strand
and
then
steadily
methodically
with
his
eyes
to
the
pavement
walked
thirty
paces
down
adam
street
this
he
said
is
where
the
corner
of
the
tivoli
would
come
not
will
come
observe
i
thanked
him
for
that
he
passed
on
measuring
out
the
thirty
additional
feet
there
was
in
his
demeanour
something
so
finely
official
that
i
felt
i
should
at
least
have
the
government
on
my
side
thus
it
was
with
no
sense
of
taking
a
farewell
look
but
rather
to
survey
a
thing
already
that
i
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
then
lifting
my
eyes
and
looking
to
and
fro
beheld
what
i
blankly
indicated
the
thing
to
my
friend
how
long
had
it
been
there
that
horrible
long
high
frontage
of
grey
stone
it
must
surely
have
been
there
before
either
of
us
was
born
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
perfect
specimen
of
architecture
perfect
in
its
pretentious
and
hateful
smugness
and
neither
of
us
had
ever
known
it
was
there
neither
of
us
therefore
could
afford
to
laugh
at
the
other
nor
did
either
of
us
laugh
at
himself
we
just
went
blankly
away
and
parted
i
daresay
my
friend
found
presently
as
i
did
balm
in
the
knowledge
that
the
tivoli
s
frontage
wouldn
t
because
it
couldn
t
be
so
bad
as
that
which
we
had
just
for
the
first
time
seen
for
me
there
was
another
a
yet
stronger
balm
and
i
went
as
though
i
trod
on
air
my
heart
singing
within
me
for
i
had
not
after
all
to
resume
my
task
of
writing
that
letter
to
the
times
books
within
books
they
must
i
suppose
be
classed
among
biblia
abiblia
greek
ignored
in
the
catalogue
of
any
library
not
one
of
them
lurking
in
any
uttermost
cavern
under
the
of
the
british
museum
none
of
them
ever
printed
even
for
private
circulation
these
books
written
by
this
and
that
character
in
fiction
are
books
only
by
courtesy
and
good
will
but
how
few
after
all
the
books
that
are
books
charles
lamb
let
his
kind
heart
master
him
when
he
made
that
too
brief
list
of
books
that
aren
t
book
is
an
honourable
title
not
to
be
conferred
lightly
a
volume
is
not
necessarily
as
lamb
would
have
had
us
think
a
book
because
it
can
be
read
without
difficulty
the
test
is
whether
it
was
worth
reading
had
the
author
something
to
set
forth
and
had
he
the
specific
gift
for
setting
it
forth
in
written
words
and
did
he
use
this
rather
rare
gift
conscientiously
and
to
the
full
and
were
his
words
well
and
appropriately
printed
and
bound
if
you
can
say
yes
to
these
questions
then
only
i
submit
is
the
title
of
book
deserved
if
lamb
were
alive
now
he
certainly
would
draw
the
line
closer
than
he
did
published
volumes
were
few
in
his
day
though
not
of
course
few
enough
even
he
in
all
the
plenitude
of
his
indulgence
would
now
have
to
demur
that
at
least
per
cent
of
the
volumes
that
the
publishers
thrust
on
us
so
hectically
every
spring
and
autumn
are
abiblia
greek
what
would
he
have
to
say
of
the
novels
for
example
these
commodities
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
no
doubt
but
let
us
have
no
illusions
as
to
what
their
way
is
the
poulterer
who
sells
strings
of
sausages
does
not
pretend
that
every
individual
sausage
is
in
itself
remarkable
he
does
not
assure
us
that
this
is
a
sausage
that
gives
furiously
to
think
or
this
is
a
singularly
beautiful
and
human
sausage
or
this
is
undoubtedly
the
sausage
of
the
why
are
such
distinctions
drawn
by
the
publisher
when
he
publishes
as
he
sometimes
does
a
novel
that
is
a
book
or
at
any
rate
would
be
a
book
if
it
were
decently
printed
and
bound
then
by
all
means
let
him
proclaim
its
difference
even
at
the
risk
of
scaring
away
the
majority
of
readers
i
admit
that
i
myself
might
be
found
in
that
majority
i
am
shy
of
masterpieces
nor
is
this
merely
because
of
the
many
times
i
have
been
disappointed
at
not
finding
anything
at
all
like
what
the
publishers
expected
me
to
find
as
a
matter
of
fact
those
disappointments
are
dim
in
my
memory
it
is
long
since
i
ceased
to
take
publishers
opinions
as
my
guide
i
trust
now
for
what
i
ought
to
read
to
the
advice
of
a
few
highly
literary
friends
but
so
soon
as
i
am
told
that
i
must
read
this
or
that
and
have
replied
that
i
instantly
will
i
become
strangely
loth
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
and
what
i
like
about
books
within
books
is
that
they
never
can
prick
my
conscience
it
is
extraordinarily
comfortable
that
they
don
t
exist
and
yet
for
even
as
must
implants
distaste
so
does
can
t
stir
sweet
longings
how
eagerly
would
i
devour
these
books
within
books
what
fun
what
a
queer
emotion
to
fish
out
from
a
in
a
windy
walter
lorraine
by
arthur
pendennis
or
passion
flowers
by
rosa
bunion
i
suppose
poor
rosa
s
muse
so
fair
and
so
fervid
in
rosa
s
day
would
seem
a
trifle
fatigued
now
but
what
allowances
one
would
make
lord
steyne
said
of
walter
lorraine
that
it
was
very
clever
and
i
fancy
we
should
apply
neither
epithet
now
indeed
i
have
always
suspected
that
pen
s
maiden
effort
may
have
been
on
a
plane
with
the
great
hoggarty
yet
i
vow
would
i
not
skip
a
line
of
it
who
put
back
the
clock
is
another
work
which
i
especially
covet
poor
gideon
forsyth
he
was
abominably
treated
as
stevenson
relates
in
the
matter
of
that
grand
but
grisly
piano
and
i
have
always
hoped
that
perhaps
in
the
end
as
a
sort
of
recompense
fate
ordained
that
the
novel
he
had
anonymously
written
should
be
rescued
from
oblivion
and
found
by
discerning
critics
to
be
not
at
all
bad
he
had
never
acknowledged
it
or
only
to
some
intimate
friends
while
it
was
still
in
proof
after
its
appearance
and
alarming
failure
the
modesty
of
the
author
had
become
more
pressing
and
the
secret
was
now
likely
to
be
better
kept
than
that
of
the
authorship
of
such
an
humiliation
as
gideon
s
is
the
more
poignant
to
me
because
it
is
so
rare
in
english
fiction
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
a
book
within
a
book
is
an
immediate
an
immense
success
on
the
whole
our
novelists
have
always
tended
to
optimism
especially
they
who
have
written
mainly
to
please
their
public
it
pleases
the
public
to
read
about
any
sort
of
success
the
greater
the
more
sudden
and
violent
the
success
the
more
valuable
is
it
as
ingredient
in
a
novel
and
since
the
average
novelist
lives
always
in
a
dream
that
one
of
his
works
will
somehow
catch
on
as
no
other
work
ever
has
caught
on
yet
it
is
very
natural
that
he
should
fondly
try
meanwhile
to
get
this
dream
realised
for
him
vicariously
by
this
or
that
creature
of
his
fancy
true
he
is
usually
too
to
let
this
creature
achieve
his
sudden
fame
and
endless
fortune
through
a
novel
usually
it
is
a
play
that
does
the
trick
in
the
victorian
time
it
was
almost
always
a
book
of
poems
oh
for
the
spacious
days
of
tennyson
and
swinburne
in
how
many
a
novel
is
mentioned
some
slim
octavo
which
seems
from
the
account
given
to
have
been
as
arresting
as
poems
and
ballads
without
being
less
acceptable
than
idylls
of
the
king
these
verses
were
always
the
anonymous
work
of
some
very
young
very
poor
man
who
supposed
they
had
fallen
from
the
press
until
one
day
a
week
or
so
after
publication
as
he
walked
moodily
and
in
a
brown
study
along
the
strand
having
given
up
all
hope
now
that
he
would
ever
be
in
a
position
to
ask
hilda
to
be
his
wife
a
friend
accosted
him
seen
the
thunderer
this
morning
by
george
there
s
a
column
review
of
a
new
book
of
poems
etc
in
some
novel
that
i
once
read
at
a
seaside
place
having
borrowed
it
from
the
little
circulating
library
there
was
a
young
poet
whose
sudden
leap
into
the
front
rank
has
always
laid
a
special
hold
on
my
imagination
the
name
of
the
novel
itself
i
can
not
recall
but
i
remember
the
name
of
the
young
poet
aylmer
deane
and
the
forever
unforgettable
title
of
his
book
of
verse
was
poments
being
poems
of
the
mood
and
the
moment
what
would
i
not
give
to
possess
a
copy
of
that
work
though
he
had
suffered
and
though
suffering
is
a
sovereign
preparation
for
great
work
i
did
not
at
the
outset
foresee
that
aylmer
deane
was
destined
to
wear
the
laurel
in
real
life
i
have
rather
a
flair
for
future
eminence
in
novels
i
am
apt
to
be
wise
only
after
the
event
there
the
young
men
who
do
in
due
course
take
the
town
by
storm
have
seldom
shown
to
my
dull
eyes
promise
their
spoken
thoughts
have
seemed
to
me
no
more
profound
or
pungent
than
my
own
all
that
is
best
in
these
authors
goes
into
their
work
but
though
i
complain
of
them
on
this
count
i
admit
that
the
thrill
for
me
of
their
triumphs
is
the
more
rapturous
because
every
time
it
catches
me
unawares
one
of
the
greatest
emotions
i
ever
had
was
from
the
triumph
of
the
gift
of
gifts
of
this
novel
within
a
novel
the
author
was
not
a
young
man
at
all
but
an
elderly
clergyman
whose
life
had
been
spent
in
a
little
rural
parish
he
was
a
dear
simple
old
man
a
widower
he
had
a
large
family
a
small
stipend
judge
then
of
his
horror
when
he
found
that
his
eldest
son
a
scholar
at
christminster
college
oxbridge
had
run
into
debt
for
many
hundreds
of
pounds
where
to
turn
the
father
was
too
proud
to
borrow
of
the
neighbourly
nobleman
who
in
oxbridge
days
had
been
his
nor
had
the
father
ever
practised
the
art
of
writing
we
are
told
that
his
sermons
were
always
but
years
ago
he
had
once
thought
of
writing
a
novel
based
on
an
experience
which
happened
to
a
friend
of
this
novel
in
the
fullness
of
time
he
now
proceeded
to
write
though
without
much
hope
of
he
knew
that
he
was
suffering
from
but
he
worked
feverishly
night
after
night
we
are
told
in
his
old
faded
till
the
dawn
mingled
with
the
light
of
his
candle
and
warned
him
to
snatch
a
few
hours
rest
failing
which
he
would
be
little
able
to
perform
the
round
of
parish
duties
that
awaited
him
in
the
no
wonder
he
had
not
much
no
wonder
i
had
no
spark
of
hope
for
him
but
what
are
obstacles
for
but
to
be
overleapt
what
avails
and
feverish
haste
and
total
lack
of
literary
training
as
against
the
romantic
instinct
of
the
lady
who
created
the
rev
charles
hailing
the
gift
of
gifts
was
acclaimed
as
a
masterpiece
by
all
the
also
it
very
soon
brought
in
ten
times
as
much
money
as
was
needed
to
pay
off
the
debts
of
its
author
s
eldest
son
nor
though
charles
hailing
died
some
months
later
are
we
told
that
he
died
from
the
strain
of
composition
we
are
left
merely
to
rejoice
at
knowing
he
knew
at
the
last
that
his
whole
family
was
provided
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
whilst
these
charles
hailings
and
aylmer
deanes
delightfully
abound
in
the
lower
reaches
of
english
fiction
we
have
so
seldom
found
in
the
work
of
our
great
novelists
anything
at
all
about
the
writing
of
a
great
book
it
is
true
of
course
that
our
great
novelists
have
never
had
for
the
idea
of
literature
itself
that
passion
which
has
always
burned
in
the
great
french
ones
their
own
art
has
never
seemed
to
them
the
most
important
and
interesting
thing
in
life
also
it
is
true
that
they
have
had
other
occupations
preaching
editing
magazines
what
not
yet
to
them
literature
must
as
their
own
main
task
have
had
a
peculiar
interest
and
importance
no
fine
work
can
be
done
without
concentration
and
and
toil
and
doubt
it
is
nonsense
to
imagine
that
our
great
novelists
have
just
forged
ahead
or
ambled
along
reaching
their
goal
in
the
good
old
english
fashion
by
sheer
divination
of
the
way
to
it
a
fine
book
with
all
that
goes
to
the
making
of
it
is
as
fine
a
theme
as
a
novelist
can
have
but
it
is
a
part
of
english
hypocrisy
or
let
it
be
more
politely
said
english
reserve
that
whilst
we
are
fluent
enough
in
grumbling
about
small
inconveniences
we
insist
on
making
light
of
any
great
difficulties
or
griefs
that
may
beset
us
and
just
there
i
suppose
is
the
reason
why
our
great
novelists
have
shunned
great
books
as
it
is
fortunate
for
us
jarring
though
it
is
to
our
patriotic
sense
that
henry
james
was
not
born
an
englishman
that
he
was
born
of
a
race
of
specialists
men
who
are
impenitent
specialists
in
whatever
they
take
up
be
it
sport
commerce
politics
anything
and
it
is
fortunate
for
us
that
in
paris
and
in
the
straitest
literary
sect
there
his
method
began
to
form
itself
and
the
art
of
prose
fiction
became
to
him
a
religion
in
that
art
he
finds
as
much
inspiration
as
swinburne
found
in
the
art
of
poetry
just
as
swinburne
was
the
most
learned
of
our
poets
so
is
james
the
most
learned
of
our
let
us
say
our
i
doubt
whether
the
heaped
total
of
his
admirations
would
be
found
to
outweigh
the
least
one
of
the
admirations
that
swinburne
had
but
though
he
has
been
a
reader
of
the
works
that
are
good
enough
for
him
to
praise
his
abstract
passion
for
the
art
of
fiction
itself
has
always
been
fierce
and
constant
partly
to
the
parisian
partly
to
the
american
element
in
him
we
owe
the
stories
that
he
and
of
our
great
writers
he
only
has
written
about
books
and
the
writers
of
books
here
indeed
in
these
incomparable
stories
are
imaginary
great
books
that
are
as
real
to
us
as
real
ones
are
sometimes
as
in
the
author
of
beltraffio
a
great
book
itself
is
the
very
hero
of
the
story
we
are
not
told
what
exactly
was
the
title
of
that
second
book
which
ambient
s
wife
so
hated
that
she
let
her
child
die
rather
than
that
he
should
grow
up
under
the
influence
of
its
author
but
i
have
a
queer
conviction
that
it
was
the
daisies
usually
in
these
stories
it
is
through
the
medium
of
some
ardent
young
disciple
speaking
in
the
first
person
that
we
become
familiar
with
the
great
writer
it
is
thus
that
we
know
hugh
vereker
throughout
whose
twenty
volumes
was
woven
that
message
or
meaning
that
figure
in
the
carpet
which
eluded
even
the
elect
it
is
thus
that
we
know
neil
paraday
the
of
whose
last
book
was
mislaid
and
lost
so
tragically
so
comically
and
it
is
also
through
paraday
s
disciple
that
we
make
incidental
acquaintance
with
guy
walsingham
the
young
lady
who
wrote
obsessions
and
with
dora
forbes
the
burly
man
with
a
red
moustache
who
wrote
the
other
way
round
these
two
books
are
the
only
inferior
books
mentioned
by
james
but
stay
i
was
forgetting
the
top
of
the
tree
by
amy
evans
and
also
those
nearly
forty
volumes
by
henry
george
for
all
the
greatness
of
his
success
in
life
henry
george
is
the
saddest
of
the
authors
portrayed
by
james
his
shadowmere
was
splendid
and
its
splendour
is
the
measure
of
his
shame
the
shame
he
bore
so
bravely
in
the
ruck
of
his
he
is
the
only
one
of
those
authors
who
did
not
do
his
best
of
him
alone
it
may
not
be
said
that
he
was
generous
and
delicate
and
pursued
the
he
is
a
more
pathetic
figure
than
even
dencombe
the
author
of
the
middle
years
dencombe
s
grievance
was
against
fate
not
against
himself
it
had
taken
too
much
of
his
life
to
produce
too
little
of
his
art
the
art
had
come
but
it
had
come
after
everything
else
ah
for
another
go
ah
for
a
better
a
second
chance
that
s
the
delusion
there
never
was
to
be
but
one
we
work
in
the
dark
we
do
what
we
can
we
give
what
we
have
our
doubt
is
our
passion
and
our
passion
is
our
task
the
rest
is
the
madness
of
the
scene
of
dencombe
s
death
is
one
of
the
most
things
ever
done
by
james
it
is
so
beautiful
as
to
be
hardly
sad
it
rises
and
glows
and
gladdens
it
is
more
exquisite
than
anything
in
the
middle
years
no
i
will
not
say
that
james
s
art
can
always
carry
to
us
the
conviction
that
his
characters
books
are
as
fine
as
his
own
i
crave
it
may
be
a
foolish
whim
but
i
do
crave
ocular
evidence
for
my
belief
that
those
books
were
written
and
were
published
i
want
to
see
them
all
ranged
along
goodly
shelves
a
few
days
ago
i
sat
in
one
of
those
libraries
which
seem
to
be
doorless
nowhere
to
the
eye
was
broken
the
array
of
serried
volumes
each
door
was
flush
with
the
surrounding
shelves
across
each
the
edges
of
the
shelves
were
mimicked
and
in
the
spaces
between
these
edges
the
backs
of
books
were
pasted
congruously
with
the
whole
effect
some
of
these
backs
had
been
taken
from
actual
books
others
had
been
made
specially
and
were
stamped
with
facetious
titles
that
rather
depressed
me
here
thought
i
are
the
shelves
on
which
dencombe
s
works
ought
to
be
made
manifest
and
neil
paraday
s
too
and
vereker
not
henry
george
s
of
course
he
would
not
himself
have
wished
it
poor
fellow
i
would
have
nothing
of
his
except
shadowmere
but
ray
limbert
i
would
have
all
of
his
including
a
first
edition
of
the
major
key
that
rose
as
to
which
we
watched
in
private
the
formation
of
petal
after
petal
and
flame
after
flame
and
also
the
hidden
heart
the
shortest
of
his
novels
but
perhaps
the
loveliest
as
james
and
i
have
always
thought
how
my
fingers
would
hover
along
these
shelves
always
just
going
to
alight
but
never
lest
the
spell
were
broken
alighting
how
well
they
would
look
there
those
treasures
of
mine
and
most
of
them
having
been
issued
in
the
seemly
old
form
how
many
shelves
they
would
fill
but
i
should
find
a
place
certainly
for
a
certain
small
brown
book
adorned
with
a
gilt
griffin
between
wheatsheaves
the
pilgrim
s
scrip
that
delightful
though
anonymous
work
of
my
old
friend
austin
absworthy
bearne
feverel
and
i
should
like
to
find
a
place
for
poems
by
aurora
leigh
snodgrass
s
book
of
verses
might
grace
one
of
the
lower
shelves
what
is
the
title
of
it
amelia
s
bower
i
hazard
recollections
of
the
late
lord
byron
and
others
by
captain
sumph
would
be
somewhere
for
sumph
did
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
take
shandon
s
advice
and
compile
a
volume
bungay
published
it
indeed
of
the
books
for
which
i
should
find
room
there
are
a
good
few
that
bear
the
imprimatur
of
bungay
desperatin
or
the
fugitive
duchess
by
the
hon
percy
popjoy
was
bungay
s
and
so
of
course
were
passion
flowers
and
walter
lorraine
of
the
books
issued
by
the
rival
firm
of
bacon
i
possess
but
one
memoirs
of
the
poisoners
by
slocum
near
to
popjoy
s
romance
would
be
the
lady
flabella
of
which
wititterly
said
to
kate
nickleby
so
voluptuous
is
it
not
so
soft
who
put
back
the
clock
would
have
a
place
of
honour
unearned
by
its
own
merits
among
other
novels
that
i
could
not
spare
the
gift
of
gifts
would
conspicuously
gleam
as
for
poments
ah
i
should
not
be
content
with
one
copy
of
that
even
at
the
risk
of
crowding
out
a
host
of
treasures
i
vow
i
would
have
a
copy
of
every
one
of
the
editions
that
poments
ran
through
the
golden
drugget
primitive
and
essential
things
have
great
power
to
touch
the
heart
of
the
beholder
i
mean
such
things
as
a
man
ploughing
a
field
or
sowing
or
reaping
a
girl
filling
a
pitcher
from
a
spring
a
young
mother
with
her
child
a
fisherman
mending
his
nets
a
light
from
a
lonely
hut
on
a
dark
night
things
such
as
these
are
the
best
themes
for
poets
and
painters
and
appeal
to
aught
that
there
may
be
of
painter
or
poet
in
any
one
of
us
strictly
they
are
not
so
old
as
the
hills
but
they
are
more
significant
and
eloquent
than
hills
hills
will
outlast
them
but
hills
glacially
surviving
the
life
of
man
on
this
planet
are
of
as
little
account
as
hills
tremulous
and
hot
in
ages
before
the
life
of
man
had
its
beginning
nature
is
interesting
only
because
of
us
and
the
best
symbols
of
us
are
such
sights
as
i
have
just
mentioned
sights
unalterable
by
fashion
of
time
or
place
sights
that
in
all
countries
always
were
and
never
will
not
be
it
is
true
that
in
many
districts
nowadays
there
are
elaborate
new
kinds
of
machinery
for
ploughing
the
fields
and
reaping
the
corn
in
the
most
progressive
districts
of
all
i
daresay
the
very
sowing
of
the
grain
is
done
by
means
of
some
engine
with
better
results
than
could
be
got
by
hand
for
aught
i
know
there
is
a
patented
invention
for
catching
fish
by
electricity
it
is
natural
that
we
should
in
some
degree
pride
ourselves
on
such
triumphs
it
is
well
that
we
should
have
poems
about
them
and
pictures
of
them
but
such
poems
and
pictures
can
not
touch
our
hearts
very
deeply
they
can
not
stir
in
us
the
sense
of
our
kinship
with
the
whole
dim
past
and
the
whole
dim
future
the
ancient
egyptians
were
great
at
scientific
dodges
very
great
indeed
nearly
as
great
as
we
the
archaeologists
tell
us
sand
buried
the
memory
of
those
dodges
for
a
rather
long
time
how
are
we
to
know
that
the
glories
of
our
present
civilisation
will
never
be
lost
the
world
s
and
are
exhaustible
and
it
is
not
i
am
told
by
any
means
certain
that
scientists
will
discover
any
good
substitutes
for
the
materials
which
are
necessary
to
mankind
s
present
pitch
of
glory
mankind
may
i
infer
have
to
sink
back
into
slow
and
simple
ways
continent
be
once
more
separated
from
continent
nation
from
nation
village
from
village
and
even
supposing
that
the
present
rate
of
traction
and
communication
and
all
the
rest
of
it
can
forever
be
maintained
is
our
modern
way
of
life
so
great
a
success
that
mankind
will
surely
never
be
willing
to
let
it
lapse
doubtless
that
present
rate
can
be
not
only
maintained
but
also
accelerated
immensely
in
the
near
future
will
these
greater
glories
be
voted
even
by
the
biggest
fools
an
improvement
we
smile
already
at
the
people
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
who
thought
that
the
vistas
opened
by
applied
science
were
very
heavenly
we
have
travelled
far
along
those
vistas
light
is
not
abundant
in
them
is
it
we
are
proud
of
having
gone
such
a
long
way
but
peradventure
those
who
come
after
us
will
turn
back
sooner
or
later
of
their
own
accord
this
is
a
humbling
thought
if
the
wonders
of
our
civilisation
are
doomed
we
should
prefer
them
to
cease
through
lack
of
the
minerals
and
mineral
products
that
keep
them
going
possibly
they
are
not
doomed
at
all
but
this
chance
counts
for
little
as
against
the
certainty
that
whatever
happens
the
primitive
and
essential
things
will
never
anywhere
wholly
cease
while
mankind
lasts
and
thus
it
is
that
brown
s
ode
to
the
steam
plough
jones
sonnet
sequence
on
the
automatic
reaping
machine
and
robinson
s
epic
of
the
piscicidal
dynamo
leave
unstirred
the
deeper
depths
of
emotion
in
us
the
subjects
chosen
by
these
three
great
poets
do
not
much
impress
us
when
we
regard
them
sub
specie
aeternitatis
smith
has
painted
nothing
more
masterly
than
his
picture
of
a
girl
turning
a
tap
but
has
he
never
seen
a
girl
fill
a
pitcher
from
a
spring
smithers
picture
of
a
young
mother
seconding
a
resolution
at
a
meeting
of
a
board
of
guardians
is
magnificent
as
brushwork
but
why
not
have
cut
out
the
board
and
put
in
the
baby
i
yield
to
no
one
in
admiration
of
smithkins
facade
of
the
waldorf
hotel
by
night
in
peace
but
a
single
light
from
a
lonely
hut
would
have
been
a
finer
theme
i
should
like
to
show
smithkins
the
thing
that
i
call
the
golden
drugget
or
rather
as
this
thing
is
greatly
romantic
to
me
and
that
painter
is
so
unfortunate
in
his
surname
i
should
like
smithkins
to
find
it
for
himself
these
words
are
written
in
war
time
and
in
england
there
are
i
hear
lighting
restrictions
even
on
the
far
riviera
di
levante
i
take
it
that
the
golden
drugget
is
not
outspread
across
the
high
dark
between
rapallo
and
zoagli
but
the
lonely
wayside
inn
is
still
there
doubtless
and
its
narrow
door
will
again
stand
open
giving
out
for
wayfarers
its
old
span
of
brightness
into
darkness
when
peace
comes
it
is
nothing
by
daylight
that
inn
if
anything
it
is
rather
an
offence
steep
behind
it
rise
mountains
that
are
grey
all
over
with
olive
trees
and
beneath
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
the
cliff
falls
sheer
to
the
sea
the
road
is
white
the
sea
and
sky
are
usually
of
a
deep
bright
blue
there
are
many
single
cypresses
among
the
olives
it
is
a
scene
of
good
colour
and
noble
form
it
is
a
gay
and
a
grand
scene
in
which
the
inn
though
unassuming
is
unpleasing
if
you
pay
attention
to
it
an
ugly
little
inn
a
and
uninviting
inn
salt
and
tobacco
it
announces
in
faint
letters
above
the
door
may
be
bought
there
but
one
would
prefer
to
buy
these
things
elsewhere
there
is
a
bench
outside
and
a
rickety
table
with
a
zinc
top
to
it
and
sometimes
a
peasant
or
two
drinking
a
glass
or
two
of
wine
the
proprietress
is
very
unkempt
to
don
quixote
she
would
have
seemed
a
princess
and
the
inn
a
castle
and
the
peasants
notable
magicians
don
quixote
would
have
paused
here
and
done
something
not
so
do
i
by
daylight
on
the
way
down
from
my
little
home
to
rapallo
or
up
from
rapallo
home
i
am
indeed
hardly
conscious
that
this
inn
exists
by
moonlight
too
it
is
negligible
stars
are
rather
unbecoming
to
it
but
on
a
thoroughly
dark
night
when
it
is
manifest
as
nothing
but
a
strip
of
yellow
light
cast
across
the
road
from
an
door
great
always
is
its
magic
for
me
is
i
mean
was
but
then
i
mean
also
will
be
and
so
i
cleave
to
the
present
tense
the
nostalgic
present
as
grammarians
might
call
it
likewise
when
i
say
that
thoroughly
dark
nights
are
rare
here
i
mean
that
they
are
rare
in
the
gulf
of
genoa
clouds
do
not
seem
to
like
our
landscape
but
it
has
often
struck
me
that
italian
nights
whenever
clouds
do
congregate
are
somehow
as
much
darker
than
english
nights
as
italian
days
are
brighter
than
days
in
england
they
have
a
heavier
and
thicker
nigritude
they
shut
things
out
from
you
more
impenetrably
they
enclose
you
as
in
a
small
pavilion
of
black
velvet
this
tenement
is
not
very
comfortable
in
a
strong
gale
it
makes
you
feel
rather
helpless
and
gales
can
be
strong
enough
in
the
late
autumn
on
the
riviera
di
levante
it
is
on
nights
when
the
wind
blows
its
hardest
but
makes
no
rift
anywhere
for
a
star
to
peep
through
that
the
golden
drugget
as
i
approach
it
gladdens
my
heart
the
most
the
distance
between
rapallo
and
my
home
up
yonder
is
rather
more
than
two
miles
the
road
curves
and
zigzags
sharply
for
the
most
part
but
at
the
end
of
the
first
mile
it
runs
straight
for
three
or
four
hundred
yards
and
as
the
inn
stands
at
a
point
midway
on
this
straight
course
the
golden
drugget
is
visible
to
me
long
before
i
come
to
it
even
by
starlight
it
is
good
to
see
how
much
better
if
i
happen
to
be
out
on
a
black
rough
night
when
nothing
is
disclosed
but
this
one
calm
bright
thing
nothing
well
there
has
been
descriable
all
the
way
a
certain
grey
glimmer
immediately
in
front
of
my
feet
this
in
point
of
fact
is
the
road
and
by
following
it
carefully
i
have
managed
to
escape
collision
with
trees
bushes
stone
walls
the
continuous
shrill
wailing
of
trees
branches
writhing
unseen
but
near
and
the
great
hoarse
roar
of
the
sea
against
the
rocks
far
down
below
are
no
cheerful
accompaniment
for
the
buffeted
pilgrim
he
feels
that
he
is
engaged
in
single
combat
with
nature
at
her
unfriendliest
he
isn
t
sure
that
she
hasn
t
supernatural
allies
working
with
her
witches
on
broomsticks
circling
closely
round
him
demons
in
pursuit
of
him
or
waiting
to
leap
out
on
him
and
how
about
mere
robbers
and
cutthroats
suppose
but
look
that
streak
yonder
look
the
golden
drugget
there
it
is
familiar
serene
festal
that
the
pilgrim
knew
he
would
see
it
in
due
time
does
not
diminish
for
him
the
queer
joy
of
seeing
it
nay
this
emotion
would
be
far
less
without
that
foreknowledge
some
things
are
best
at
first
sight
others
and
here
is
one
of
them
do
ever
improve
by
recognition
i
remember
that
when
first
i
beheld
this
steady
strip
of
light
shed
forth
over
a
threshold
level
with
the
road
it
seemed
to
me
conceivably
sinister
it
brought
stevenson
to
my
mind
the
chink
of
doubloons
and
the
clash
of
cutlasses
and
i
think
i
quickened
pace
as
i
passed
it
but
now
now
it
inspires
in
me
a
sense
of
deep
trust
and
gratitude
and
such
awe
as
i
have
for
it
is
altogether
a
loving
awe
as
for
holy
ground
that
should
he
trod
lightly
a
drugget
of
crimson
cloth
across
a
london
pavement
is
rather
resented
by
the
casual
as
saying
to
him
step
across
me
stranger
but
not
along
me
not
in
and
for
answer
he
spurns
it
with
his
heel
stranger
come
in
is
the
clear
message
of
the
golden
drugget
this
is
but
a
humble
and
earthly
hostel
yet
you
will
find
here
a
radiant
company
of
angels
and
and
always
i
cherish
the
belief
that
if
i
obeyed
the
summons
i
should
receive
fulfilment
of
the
promise
well
the
beliefs
that
one
most
cherishes
one
is
least
willing
to
test
i
do
not
go
in
at
that
open
door
but
lingering
but
reluctant
is
my
tread
as
i
pass
by
it
and
i
pause
to
bathe
in
the
light
that
is
as
the
span
of
our
human
life
granted
between
one
great
darkness
and
another
hosts
and
guests
beautifully
vague
though
the
english
language
is
with
its
meanings
merging
into
one
another
as
softly
as
the
facts
of
landscape
in
the
moist
english
climate
and
much
addicted
though
we
always
have
been
to
ways
of
compromise
and
averse
from
sharp
hard
logical
outlines
we
do
not
call
a
host
a
guest
nor
a
guest
a
host
the
ancient
romans
did
so
they
with
a
language
that
was
as
lucid
as
their
climate
and
was
a
perfect
expression
of
the
sharp
hard
logical
outlook
fostered
by
that
climate
had
but
one
word
for
those
two
things
nor
have
their
equally
acute
descendants
done
what
might
have
been
expected
of
them
in
this
matter
hate
and
spite
are
as
mysteriously
equivocal
as
hopes
by
weight
of
all
this
authority
i
find
myself
being
dragged
to
the
conclusion
that
a
host
and
a
guest
must
be
the
same
thing
after
all
yet
in
a
dim
and
muzzy
way
deep
down
in
my
breast
i
feel
sure
that
they
are
different
compromise
you
see
as
usual
i
take
it
that
strictly
the
two
things
are
one
but
that
our
division
of
them
is
yet
another
instance
of
that
sterling
by
which
etc
i
would
go
even
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
difference
is
more
than
merely
circumstantial
and
particular
i
seem
to
discern
also
a
temperamental
and
general
difference
you
ask
me
to
dine
with
you
in
a
restaurant
i
say
i
shall
be
delighted
you
order
the
meal
i
praise
it
you
pay
for
it
i
have
the
pleasant
sensation
of
not
paying
for
it
and
it
is
well
that
each
of
us
should
have
a
label
according
to
the
part
he
plays
in
this
transaction
but
the
two
labels
are
applicable
in
a
larger
and
more
philosophic
way
in
every
human
being
one
or
the
other
of
these
two
instincts
is
predominant
the
active
or
positive
instinct
to
offer
hospitality
the
negative
or
passive
instinct
to
accept
it
and
either
of
these
instincts
is
so
significant
of
character
that
one
might
well
say
that
mankind
is
divisible
into
two
great
classes
hosts
and
guests
i
have
already
see
third
sentence
of
foregoing
paragraph
somewhat
prepared
you
for
the
shock
of
a
confession
which
candour
now
forces
from
me
i
am
one
of
the
guests
you
are
however
so
shocked
that
you
will
read
no
more
of
me
bravo
your
refusal
indicates
that
you
have
not
a
guestish
soul
here
am
i
trying
to
entertain
you
and
you
will
not
be
entertained
you
stand
shouting
that
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
very
well
for
my
part
i
would
rather
read
than
write
any
day
you
shall
write
this
essay
for
me
be
it
never
so
humble
i
shall
give
it
my
best
attention
and
manage
to
say
something
nice
about
it
i
am
sorry
to
see
you
calming
suddenly
down
nothing
but
a
sense
of
duty
to
myself
and
to
guests
in
general
makes
me
resume
my
pen
i
believe
guests
to
be
as
numerous
really
as
hosts
it
may
be
that
even
you
if
you
examine
yourself
dispassionately
will
find
that
you
are
one
of
them
in
which
case
you
may
yet
thank
me
for
some
comfort
i
think
there
are
good
qualities
to
be
found
in
guests
and
some
bad
ones
in
even
the
best
hosts
our
deepest
instincts
bad
or
good
are
those
which
we
share
with
the
rest
of
the
animal
creation
to
offer
hospitality
or
to
accept
it
is
but
an
instinct
which
man
has
acquired
in
the
long
course
of
his
lions
do
not
ask
one
another
to
their
lairs
nor
do
birds
keep
open
nest
certain
wolves
and
tigers
it
is
true
have
been
so
seduced
by
man
from
their
natural
state
that
they
will
deign
to
accept
man
s
hospitality
but
when
you
give
a
bone
to
your
dog
does
he
run
out
and
invite
another
dog
to
share
it
with
him
and
does
your
cat
insist
on
having
a
circle
of
other
cats
around
her
saucer
of
milk
quite
the
contrary
a
deep
sense
of
personal
property
is
common
to
all
these
creatures
thousands
of
years
hence
they
may
have
acquired
some
willingness
to
share
things
with
their
friends
or
rather
dogs
may
cats
i
think
not
meanwhile
let
us
not
be
censorious
though
certain
monkeys
assuredly
were
of
finer
and
more
malleable
stuff
than
any
wolves
or
tigers
it
was
a
very
long
time
indeed
before
even
we
began
to
be
hospitable
the
cavemen
did
not
entertain
it
may
be
that
now
and
again
say
towards
the
end
of
the
stone
age
one
or
another
among
the
more
enlightened
of
them
said
to
his
wife
while
she
plucked
an
eagle
that
he
had
snared
the
day
before
that
man
who
lives
in
the
next
valley
seems
to
be
a
decent
harmless
sort
of
person
and
sometimes
i
fancy
he
is
rather
lonely
i
think
i
will
ask
him
to
dine
with
us
and
presently
going
out
met
the
man
and
said
to
him
are
you
doing
anything
if
not
won
t
you
dine
with
us
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
my
wife
only
ourselves
come
just
as
you
that
is
most
good
of
you
but
stammered
the
man
as
will
have
it
i
am
engaged
a
formal
invitation
i
wish
i
could
get
out
of
it
but
i
simply
can
t
i
have
a
morbid
conscientiousness
about
such
thus
we
see
that
the
will
to
offer
hospitality
was
an
earlier
growth
than
the
will
to
accept
it
but
we
must
beware
of
thinking
these
two
things
identical
with
the
mere
will
to
give
and
the
mere
will
to
receive
it
is
unlikely
that
the
man
would
have
refused
a
slice
of
eagle
if
it
had
been
offered
to
him
where
he
stood
and
it
is
still
more
unlikely
that
his
friend
would
have
handed
it
to
him
such
is
not
the
way
of
hosts
the
hospitable
instinct
is
not
wholly
altruistic
there
is
pride
and
egoism
mixed
up
with
it
as
i
shall
show
meanwhile
why
did
the
man
babble
those
excuses
it
was
because
he
scented
danger
he
was
not
by
nature
suspicious
but
what
possible
motive
except
murder
could
this
man
have
for
enticing
him
to
that
cave
acquaintance
in
the
open
valley
was
all
very
well
and
pleasant
but
a
strange
den
after
dark
no
no
you
despise
him
for
his
fears
yet
these
were
not
really
so
absurd
as
they
may
seem
as
man
progressed
in
civilisation
and
grew
to
be
definitely
gregarious
hospitality
became
more
a
matter
of
course
but
even
then
it
was
not
above
suspicion
it
was
not
hedged
around
with
those
unwritten
laws
which
make
it
the
safe
and
eligible
thing
we
know
in
the
annals
of
hospitality
there
are
many
pages
that
make
painful
reading
many
a
great
dark
blot
is
there
which
the
recording
angel
may
wish
but
will
not
be
able
to
wipe
out
with
a
tear
if
i
were
a
host
i
should
ignore
those
tomes
being
a
guest
i
sometimes
glance
into
them
but
with
more
of
horror
i
assure
you
than
of
malicious
amusement
i
carefully
avoid
those
which
treat
of
hospitality
among
barbarous
races
things
done
in
the
best
periods
of
the
most
enlightened
peoples
are
quite
bad
enough
the
israelites
were
the
salt
of
the
earth
but
can
you
imagine
a
deed
of
treachery
than
jael
s
you
would
think
it
must
have
been
held
accursed
by
even
the
basest
minds
yet
thus
sang
deborah
and
barak
blessed
above
women
shall
jael
the
wife
of
heber
the
kenite
be
blessed
shall
she
be
among
women
in
the
and
barak
remember
was
a
gallant
soldier
and
deborah
was
a
prophetess
who
judged
israel
at
that
so
much
for
the
ideals
of
hospitality
among
the
children
of
israel
of
the
homeric
greeks
it
may
be
said
that
they
too
were
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
it
may
be
added
that
in
their
pungent
and
antiseptic
quality
there
was
mingled
a
measure
of
sweetness
not
to
be
found
in
the
children
of
israel
i
do
not
say
outright
that
odysseus
ought
not
to
have
slain
the
suitors
that
is
a
debatable
point
it
is
true
that
they
were
guests
under
his
roof
but
he
had
not
invited
them
let
us
give
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
i
am
thinking
of
another
episode
in
his
life
by
what
circe
did
and
by
his
disregard
of
what
she
had
done
a
searching
light
is
cast
on
the
laxity
of
homeric
greek
notions
as
to
what
was
due
to
guests
odysseus
was
a
clever
but
not
a
bad
man
and
his
standard
of
general
conduct
was
high
enough
yet
having
foiled
circe
in
her
purpose
to
turn
him
into
a
swine
and
having
forced
her
to
restore
his
comrades
to
human
shape
he
did
not
let
pass
the
barrier
of
his
teeth
any
such
winged
words
as
now
will
i
bide
no
more
under
thy
roof
circe
but
fare
across
the
sea
with
my
dear
comrades
even
unto
mine
own
home
for
that
which
thou
didst
was
an
evil
thing
and
one
not
meet
to
be
done
unto
strangers
by
the
daughter
of
a
he
seems
to
have
said
nothing
in
particular
to
have
accepted
with
alacrity
the
invitation
that
he
and
his
dear
comrades
should
prolong
their
visit
and
to
have
prolonged
it
with
them
for
a
whole
year
in
the
course
of
which
circe
bore
him
a
son
named
telegonus
as
matthew
arnold
would
have
said
what
a
set
my
eye
roves
for
relief
to
those
shelves
where
the
later
annals
are
i
take
down
a
tome
at
random
rome
in
the
fifteenth
century
civilisation
never
was
more
brilliant
than
there
and
then
i
imagine
and
yet
no
i
replace
that
tome
i
saw
enough
in
it
to
remind
me
that
the
borgias
selected
and
laid
down
rare
poisons
in
their
cellars
with
as
much
thought
as
they
gave
to
their
vintage
wines
extraordinary
but
the
romans
do
not
seem
to
have
thought
so
an
invitation
to
dine
at
the
palazzo
borghese
was
accounted
the
highest
social
honour
i
am
aware
that
in
recent
books
of
italian
history
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
whiten
the
borgias
characters
but
i
myself
hold
to
the
old
romantic
black
way
of
looking
at
the
borgias
i
maintain
that
though
you
would
often
in
the
fifteenth
century
have
heard
the
snobbish
roman
say
in
a
tone
i
am
dining
with
the
borgias
no
roman
ever
was
able
to
say
i
dined
last
night
with
the
to
mankind
in
general
macbeth
and
lady
macbeth
stand
out
as
the
supreme
type
of
all
that
a
host
and
hostess
should
not
be
hence
the
marked
coolness
of
scotsmen
towards
shakespeare
hence
the
untiring
efforts
of
that
proud
and
sensitive
race
to
set
up
burns
in
his
stead
it
is
a
risky
thing
to
offer
sympathy
to
the
proud
and
sensitive
yet
i
must
say
that
i
think
the
scots
have
a
real
grievance
the
two
actual
historic
macbeths
were
no
worse
than
innumerable
other
couples
in
other
lands
that
had
not
yet
fully
struggled
out
of
barbarism
it
is
hard
that
shakespeare
happened
on
the
story
of
that
particular
pair
and
so
made
it
immortal
but
he
meant
no
harm
and
let
scotsmen
believe
me
did
positive
good
scotch
hospitality
is
proverbial
as
much
in
scotland
as
in
america
does
the
english
visitor
blush
when
he
thinks
how
perfunctory
and
niggard
in
comparison
english
hospitality
is
it
was
scotland
that
first
formalised
hospitality
made
of
it
an
exacting
code
of
honour
with
the
basic
principle
that
the
guest
must
in
all
circumstances
be
respected
and
at
all
costs
protected
jacobite
history
bristles
with
examples
of
the
heroic
sacrifices
made
by
hosts
for
their
guests
sacrifices
of
their
own
safety
and
even
of
their
own
political
convictions
for
fear
of
infringing
however
slightly
that
sacred
code
of
theirs
and
what
was
the
origin
of
all
this
noble
pedantry
shakespeare
s
perhaps
if
england
were
a
bleak
and
rugged
country
like
scotland
or
a
new
country
like
america
the
foreign
visitor
would
be
more
overwhelmed
with
kindness
here
than
he
is
the
landscapes
of
our
are
so
charming
london
abounds
in
public
monuments
so
redolent
of
history
so
romantic
and
engrossing
that
we
are
perhaps
too
apt
to
think
the
foreign
visitor
would
have
neither
time
nor
inclination
to
sit
dawdling
in
private
assuredly
there
is
no
lack
of
hospitable
impulse
among
the
english
in
what
may
be
called
mutual
hospitality
they
touch
a
high
level
the
french
also
the
italians
entertain
one
another
far
less
frequently
in
england
the
native
guest
has
a
very
good
time
indeed
though
of
course
he
pays
for
it
in
some
measure
by
acting
as
host
too
from
time
to
time
in
practice
no
there
can
not
be
any
absolute
division
of
mankind
into
my
two
categories
hosts
and
guests
but
psychologically
a
guest
does
not
cease
to
be
a
guest
when
he
gives
a
dinner
nor
is
a
host
not
a
host
when
he
accepts
one
the
amount
of
entertaining
that
a
guest
need
do
is
a
matter
wholly
for
his
own
conscience
he
will
soon
find
that
he
does
not
receive
less
hospitality
for
offering
little
and
he
would
not
receive
less
if
he
offered
none
the
amount
received
by
him
depends
wholly
on
the
degree
of
his
agreeableness
pride
makes
an
occasional
host
of
him
but
he
does
not
shine
in
that
capacity
nor
do
hosts
want
him
to
assay
it
if
they
accept
an
invitation
from
him
they
do
so
only
because
they
wish
not
to
hurt
his
feelings
as
guests
they
are
fish
out
of
water
circumstances
do
of
course
react
on
character
it
is
conventional
for
the
rich
to
give
and
for
the
poor
to
receive
riches
do
tend
to
foster
in
you
the
instincts
of
a
host
and
poverty
does
create
an
atmosphere
favourable
to
the
growth
of
guestish
instincts
but
strong
bents
make
their
own
way
not
all
guests
are
to
be
found
among
the
needy
nor
all
hosts
among
the
affluent
for
sixteen
years
after
my
education
was
by
courtesy
finished
from
the
age
that
is
of
to
the
age
of
i
lived
in
london
seeing
all
sorts
of
people
all
the
while
and
i
came
across
many
a
rich
man
who
like
the
master
of
the
shepherd
corin
was
of
churlish
disposition
and
little
recked
to
find
the
way
to
heaven
by
doing
deeds
of
on
the
other
hand
i
knew
quite
poor
men
who
were
incorrigibly
hospitable
to
such
men
all
honour
the
most
i
dare
claim
for
myself
is
that
if
i
had
been
rich
i
should
have
been
better
than
corin
s
master
even
as
it
was
i
did
my
best
but
i
had
no
authentic
joy
in
doing
it
without
the
spur
of
pride
i
might
conceivably
have
not
done
it
at
all
there
recurs
to
me
from
among
memories
of
my
boyhood
an
episode
that
is
rather
significant
in
my
school
as
in
most
others
we
received
now
and
again
hampers
from
home
at
the
dinner
in
every
house
we
all
ate
together
but
at
breakfast
and
supper
we
ate
in
four
or
five
separate
it
was
customary
for
the
receiver
of
a
hamper
to
share
the
contents
with
his
on
one
occasion
i
received
instead
of
the
usual
variegated
hamper
a
box
containing
twelve
it
happened
that
when
this
box
arrived
and
was
opened
by
me
there
was
no
one
around
of
i
was
particularly
fond
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
carried
the
box
up
to
my
cubicle
and
having
eaten
two
of
the
said
nothing
to
my
friends
that
day
about
the
other
ten
nor
anything
about
them
when
three
days
later
i
had
eaten
them
all
all
up
there
alone
thirty
years
have
elapsed
my
are
scattered
far
and
wide
the
chance
that
this
page
may
meet
the
eyes
of
some
of
them
does
not
much
dismay
me
but
i
am
glad
there
was
no
collective
and
contemporary
judgment
by
them
on
my
strange
exploit
what
defence
could
i
have
offered
suppose
i
had
said
you
see
i
am
so
essentially
a
guest
the
plea
would
have
carried
little
weight
and
yet
it
would
not
have
been
a
worthless
plea
on
receipt
of
a
hamper
a
boy
did
rise
always
in
the
esteem
of
his
his
sardines
his
marmalade
his
potted
meat
at
any
rate
while
they
lasted
did
make
us
think
that
his
parents
must
be
awfully
decent
and
that
he
was
a
not
unworthy
son
he
had
become
our
central
figure
we
expected
him
to
lead
the
conversation
we
liked
listening
to
him
his
jokes
were
good
with
those
twelve
i
could
have
dominated
my
fellows
for
a
while
but
i
had
not
a
dominant
nature
i
never
trusted
myself
as
a
leader
leading
abashed
me
i
was
happiest
in
the
comity
of
the
crowd
having
received
a
hamper
i
was
always
glad
when
it
was
finished
glad
to
fall
back
into
the
ranks
humility
is
a
virtue
and
it
is
a
virtue
innate
in
guests
boys
as
will
have
been
surmised
from
my
record
of
the
effect
of
hampers
are
all
of
them
potential
guests
it
is
only
as
they
grow
up
that
some
of
them
harden
into
hosts
it
is
likely
enough
that
if
i
when
i
grew
up
had
been
rich
my
natural
bent
to
guestship
would
have
been
diverted
and
i
too
have
become
a
sort
of
host
and
perhaps
i
should
have
passed
muster
i
suppose
i
did
pass
muster
whenever
in
the
course
of
my
long
residence
in
london
i
did
entertain
friends
but
the
memory
of
those
occasions
is
not
dear
to
me
especially
not
the
memory
of
those
that
were
in
the
more
distinguished
restaurants
somewhere
in
the
back
of
my
brain
while
i
tried
to
lead
the
conversation
brightly
was
always
the
haunting
fear
that
i
had
not
brought
enough
money
in
my
pocket
i
never
let
this
fear
master
me
i
never
said
to
any
one
will
you
have
a
liqueur
always
what
liqueur
will
you
have
but
i
postponed
as
far
as
possible
the
evil
moment
of
asking
for
the
bill
when
i
had
in
the
proper
casual
tone
i
hope
and
believe
at
length
asked
for
it
i
wished
always
it
were
not
brought
to
me
folded
on
a
plate
as
though
the
amount
were
so
hideously
high
that
i
alone
must
be
privy
to
it
so
soon
as
it
was
laid
beside
me
i
wanted
to
know
the
worst
at
once
but
i
pretended
to
be
so
occupied
in
talk
that
i
was
unaware
of
the
bill
s
presence
and
i
was
careful
to
be
always
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
when
i
raised
the
upper
fold
and
took
my
not
i
hope
frozen
glance
in
point
of
fact
the
amount
was
always
much
less
than
i
had
feared
pessimism
does
win
us
great
happy
moments
meals
in
the
restaurants
of
soho
tested
less
severely
the
pauper
guest
masquerading
as
host
but
to
them
one
could
not
ask
rich
persons
nor
even
poor
persons
unless
one
knew
them
very
well
soho
is
so
uncertain
that
the
fare
is
often
not
good
enough
to
be
palmed
off
on
even
one
s
poorest
and
oldest
friends
a
very
magnetic
host
with
a
great
gift
for
bluffing
might
no
doubt
even
in
soho
s
worst
moments
diffuse
among
his
guests
a
conviction
that
all
was
of
the
best
but
i
never
was
good
at
bluffing
i
had
always
to
let
food
speak
for
itself
it
s
cheap
was
the
only
paean
that
in
soho
s
bad
moments
ever
occurred
to
me
and
this
of
course
i
did
not
utter
and
was
it
so
cheap
after
all
soho
induces
a
certain
optimism
a
bill
there
was
always
larger
than
i
had
thought
it
would
be
every
one
even
the
richest
and
most
munificent
of
men
pays
much
by
cheque
more
than
he
pays
little
in
specie
in
restaurants
i
should
have
liked
always
to
give
cheques
but
in
any
restaurant
i
was
so
much
more
often
seen
as
guest
than
as
host
that
i
never
felt
sure
the
proprietor
would
trust
me
only
in
my
club
did
i
know
the
luxury
or
rather
the
painlessness
of
entertaining
by
cheque
a
cheque
especially
if
it
is
a
club
cheque
as
supplied
for
the
use
of
members
not
a
leaf
torn
out
of
his
own
book
makes
so
little
mark
on
any
man
s
imagination
he
dashes
off
some
words
and
figures
he
signs
his
name
with
that
vague
momentary
pleasure
which
the
sight
of
his
own
signature
anywhere
gives
him
he
walks
away
and
forgets
offering
hospitality
in
my
club
i
was
inwardly
calm
but
even
there
i
did
not
glow
though
my
face
and
manner
i
hoped
glowed
if
my
guest
was
by
nature
a
guest
i
managed
to
forget
somewhat
that
i
myself
was
a
guest
by
nature
but
if
as
now
and
then
happened
my
guest
was
a
true
and
habitual
host
i
did
feel
that
we
were
in
an
absurdly
false
relation
and
it
was
not
without
difficulty
that
i
could
restrain
myself
from
saying
to
him
this
is
all
very
well
you
know
but
frankly
your
place
is
at
the
head
of
your
own
the
host
as
guest
is
far
far
worse
than
the
guest
as
host
he
never
even
passes
muster
the
guest
in
virtue
of
a
certain
hability
that
is
part
of
his
natural
equipment
can
more
or
less
ape
the
ways
of
a
host
but
the
host
with
his
more
positive
temperament
does
not
even
attempt
the
graces
of
a
guest
by
graces
i
do
not
mean
to
imply
anything
artificial
the
guest
s
manners
are
rather
as
wild
flowers
springing
from
good
rich
soil
the
soil
of
genuine
modesty
and
gratitude
he
honourably
wishes
to
please
in
return
for
the
pleasure
he
is
receiving
he
wonders
that
people
should
be
so
kind
to
him
and
without
knowing
it
is
very
kind
to
them
but
the
host
as
i
said
earlier
in
this
essay
is
a
guest
against
his
own
will
that
is
the
root
of
the
mischief
he
feels
that
it
is
more
blessed
and
that
he
is
conferring
rather
than
accepting
a
favour
he
does
not
adjust
himself
he
forgets
his
place
he
leads
the
conversation
he
tries
genially
to
draw
you
out
he
never
comments
on
the
goodness
of
the
food
or
wine
he
looks
at
his
watch
abruptly
and
says
he
must
be
off
he
doesn
t
say
he
has
had
a
delightful
time
in
fact
his
place
is
at
the
head
of
his
own
table
his
own
table
over
his
own
cellar
under
his
own
roof
it
is
only
there
that
you
see
him
at
his
best
to
a
club
or
restaurant
he
may
sometimes
invite
you
but
not
there
not
there
my
child
do
you
get
the
full
savour
of
his
quality
in
life
or
literature
there
has
been
no
better
host
than
old
wardle
appalling
though
he
would
have
been
as
a
guest
in
club
or
restaurant
it
is
hardly
less
painful
to
think
of
him
as
a
host
there
at
dingley
dell
with
an
ample
gesture
he
made
you
free
of
all
that
was
his
he
could
not
have
given
you
a
club
or
a
restaurant
nor
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
did
he
give
you
dingley
dell
the
place
remained
his
none
knew
better
than
old
wardle
that
this
was
so
hospitality
as
we
have
agreed
is
not
one
of
the
most
instincts
in
man
whereas
the
sense
of
possession
certainly
is
not
even
old
wardle
was
a
communist
this
you
may
be
sure
he
said
to
himself
is
my
roof
these
are
my
horses
that
s
a
picture
of
my
dear
old
and
this
he
would
say
to
us
is
my
roof
sleep
soundly
under
it
these
are
my
horses
ride
them
that
s
a
portrait
of
my
dear
old
grandfather
have
a
good
look
at
but
he
did
not
ask
us
to
walk
off
with
any
of
these
things
not
even
what
he
actually
did
give
us
would
he
regard
as
having
passed
out
of
his
possession
that
he
would
muse
if
we
were
torpid
after
dinner
is
my
roast
beef
and
that
if
we
staggered
on
the
way
to
bed
is
my
cold
milk
but
surely
you
interrupt
me
to
give
and
then
not
feel
that
one
has
given
is
the
very
best
of
all
ways
of
i
agree
i
hope
you
didn
t
think
i
was
trying
to
disparage
old
wardle
i
was
merely
keeping
my
promise
to
point
out
that
from
among
the
motives
of
even
the
best
hosts
pride
and
egoism
are
not
absent
every
virtue
as
we
were
taught
in
youth
is
a
mean
between
two
extremes
and
i
think
any
virtue
is
the
better
understood
by
us
if
we
glance
at
the
vice
on
either
side
of
it
i
take
it
that
the
virtue
of
hospitality
stands
midway
between
churlishness
and
mere
ostentation
far
to
the
left
of
the
good
host
stands
he
who
doesn
t
want
to
see
anything
of
any
one
far
to
the
right
he
who
wants
a
horde
of
people
to
be
always
seeing
something
of
him
i
conjecture
that
the
figure
on
the
left
just
discernible
through
my
is
that
of
old
corin
s
master
his
name
was
never
revealed
to
us
but
corin
s
brief
account
of
his
character
suffices
deeds
of
hospitality
is
a
dismal
phrase
that
could
have
occurred
only
to
the
servant
of
a
very
dismal
master
not
less
is
corin
s
idea
that
men
who
do
these
deeds
do
them
only
to
save
their
souls
in
the
next
world
it
is
a
pity
shakespeare
did
not
actually
bring
corin
s
master
on
to
the
stage
one
would
have
liked
to
see
the
old
man
genuinely
touched
by
the
charming
eloquence
of
rosalind
s
appeal
for
a
crust
of
bread
and
conscious
that
he
would
probably
go
to
heaven
if
he
granted
it
and
yet
not
quite
able
to
grant
it
far
away
though
he
stands
to
the
left
of
the
good
host
he
has
yet
something
in
common
with
that
third
person
discernible
on
the
right
that
speck
yonder
which
i
believe
to
be
lucullus
nothing
that
we
know
of
lucullus
suggests
that
he
was
less
inhuman
than
the
churl
of
arden
it
does
not
appear
that
he
had
a
single
friend
nor
that
he
wished
for
one
his
lavishness
was
indiscriminate
except
in
that
he
entertained
only
the
rich
one
would
have
liked
to
dine
with
him
but
not
even
in
the
act
of
digestion
could
one
have
felt
that
he
had
a
heart
one
would
have
acknowledged
that
in
all
the
material
resources
of
his
art
he
was
a
master
and
also
that
he
practised
his
art
for
sheer
love
of
it
wishing
to
be
admired
for
nothing
but
his
mastery
and
cocking
no
eye
on
any
of
those
ulterior
objects
but
for
which
some
of
the
most
prominent
hosts
would
not
entertain
at
all
but
the
very
fact
that
he
was
an
artist
is
repulsive
when
hospitality
becomes
an
art
it
loses
its
very
soul
with
this
reflection
i
look
away
from
lucullus
and
fixing
my
gaze
on
the
middle
ground
am
the
better
able
to
appreciate
the
excellence
of
the
figure
that
stands
before
me
the
figure
of
old
wardle
some
pride
and
egoism
in
that
capacious
breast
yes
but
a
great
heart
full
of
kindness
and
ever
a
warm
spontaneous
welcome
to
the
stranger
in
need
and
to
all
old
friends
and
young
hark
he
is
shouting
something
he
is
asking
us
both
down
to
dingley
dell
and
you
have
shouted
back
that
you
will
be
delighted
ah
did
i
not
suspect
from
the
first
that
you
too
were
perhaps
a
guest
but
i
constrain
you
in
the
act
of
rushing
off
to
pack
your
things
one
moment
this
essay
has
yet
to
be
finished
we
have
yet
to
glance
at
those
two
extremes
between
which
the
mean
is
good
guestship
far
to
the
right
of
the
good
guest
we
descry
the
parasite
far
to
the
left
the
churl
again
not
the
same
churl
perhaps
we
do
not
know
that
corin
s
master
was
ever
sampled
as
a
guest
i
am
inclined
to
call
yonder
speck
dante
dante
alighieri
of
whom
we
do
know
that
he
received
during
his
exile
much
hospitality
from
many
hosts
and
repaid
them
by
writing
how
bitter
was
the
bread
in
their
houses
and
how
steep
the
stairs
were
to
think
of
dour
dante
as
a
guest
is
less
dispiriting
only
than
to
think
what
he
would
have
been
as
a
host
had
it
ever
occurred
to
him
to
entertain
any
one
or
anything
except
a
deep
regard
for
beatrice
and
one
turns
with
positive
relief
to
have
a
glimpse
of
the
parasite
smurge
i
presume
whose
gratitude
was
as
boundless
as
his
appetite
and
his
presence
as
unsought
as
it
appeared
to
be
but
now
how
gracious
and
admirable
is
the
central
figure
radiating
gratitude
but
not
too
much
of
it
never
intrusive
ever
within
call
full
of
dignity
yet
all
amenable
quiet
yet
lively
never
echoing
ever
amplifying
never
contradicting
but
often
lighting
the
way
to
truth
an
ornament
an
inspiration
anywhere
such
is
he
but
who
is
he
it
is
easier
to
confess
a
defect
than
to
claim
a
quality
i
have
told
you
that
when
i
lived
in
london
i
was
nothing
as
a
host
but
i
will
not
claim
to
have
been
a
perfect
guest
nor
indeed
was
i
was
a
good
one
but
looking
back
i
see
myself
not
quite
in
the
centre
slightly
to
the
left
slightly
to
the
churlish
side
i
was
rather
too
quiet
and
i
did
sometimes
contradict
and
though
i
always
liked
to
be
invited
anywhere
i
very
often
preferred
to
stay
at
home
if
any
one
hereafter
shall
form
a
collection
of
the
notes
written
by
me
in
reply
to
invitations
i
am
afraid
he
will
gradually
suppose
me
to
have
been
more
in
request
than
ever
i
really
was
and
to
have
been
also
a
great
invalid
and
a
great
traveller
a
point
to
be
remembered
by
very
eminent
men
one
of
the
things
a
man
best
remembers
in
later
years
is
the
first
time
he
set
eyes
on
some
illustrious
elder
whose
achievements
had
already
inflamed
him
to
special
reverence
in
almost
every
autobiography
you
will
find
recorded
the
thrill
of
that
first
sight
with
the
thrill
perhaps
there
was
a
slight
shock
great
men
are
but
most
of
them
indeed
are
rather
short
no
matter
to
youth
the
shock
did
but
swell
the
thrill
it
did
but
enlarge
the
wonder
that
this
was
the
man
himself
the
man
who
i
was
about
to
say
who
had
written
those
inspired
you
see
the
autobiographists
are
usually
people
with
an
innate
twist
towards
writing
people
whose
heroes
therefore
were
men
of
letters
and
thus
especially
as
i
myself
have
that
twist
i
am
apt
to
think
of
literary
as
flourishing
more
than
could
any
other
kind
i
must
try
to
be
less
narrow
at
first
sight
of
the
lord
chancellor
doubtless
unforgettable
emotions
rise
in
the
breast
of
a
young
man
who
has
felt
from
his
earliest
years
the
passionate
desire
to
be
a
lawyer
one
whose
dream
it
is
to
excel
in
trade
will
have
been
profoundly
stirred
at
finding
himself
face
to
face
with
sir
thomas
lipton
at
least
i
suppose
so
i
speak
without
conviction
i
am
inclined
after
all
to
think
that
there
is
in
the
literary
temperament
a
special
sensibility
whereby
these
great
first
envisagements
mean
more
to
it
than
to
natures
of
a
more
practical
kind
so
it
is
primarily
to
men
very
eminent
in
literature
that
i
venture
to
offer
a
hint
for
making
those
envisagements
as
great
as
possible
the
hint
will
serve
only
in
certain
cases
there
are
various
ways
in
which
a
young
man
may
chance
to
see
his
hero
for
the
first
time
one
wintry
afternoon
not
long
after
i
came
to
london
the
autobiographist
will
tell
you
i
happened
to
be
in
cheyne
walk
bent
on
i
know
not
what
errand
when
i
saw
coming
slowly
along
the
pavement
an
old
man
he
wore
a
hat
of
the
kind
that
was
called
in
those
days
a
and
he
leaned
heavily
on
a
stick
which
he
carried
in
his
right
hand
i
stood
reverently
aside
to
let
him
pass
the
man
who
had
first
taught
me
to
see
to
feel
to
think
yes
it
was
thomas
carlyle
and
as
he
went
by
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
my
heart
stood
still
within
me
what
struck
me
most
in
that
face
was
the
eyes
i
had
never
i
have
never
since
seen
a
pair
of
eyes
which
etc
this
is
well
enough
and
i
don
t
say
that
the
writer
has
exaggerated
the
force
of
the
impression
he
received
i
say
merely
that
the
impression
would
have
been
stronger
still
if
he
had
seen
carlyle
in
a
room
the
open
air
is
not
really
a
good
setting
for
a
hero
it
is
too
diffuse
it
is
too
impersonal
four
walls
a
ceiling
and
a
floor
these
things
are
needed
to
concentrate
for
the
worshipper
the
vision
vouchsafed
even
if
the
room
be
a
public
one
a
say
at
clapham
junction
it
is
very
helpful
far
more
so
if
it
be
a
room
in
a
private
house
where
besides
the
vision
itself
is
thrust
on
the
worshipper
the
dizzy
sense
of
a
personal
relationship
dip
with
me
for
an
example
into
some
other
autobiography
here
shortly
after
i
came
to
london
it
is
odd
that
autobiographists
never
are
born
or
bred
there
one
of
the
houses
i
found
open
to
me
was
that
of
t
a
woman
whom
so
it
seemed
to
me
when
in
later
years
i
studied
italian
the
word
simpatica
described
exactly
and
who
as
the
phrase
is
knew
calling
on
her
one
sunday
afternoon
i
noticed
among
the
guests
as
i
came
in
a
short
stalwart
man
with
a
grey
beard
i
particularly
my
hostess
whispered
to
me
want
you
to
know
robert
everything
in
the
room
seemed
to
swim
round
me
and
i
had
the
sensation
of
literally
sinking
through
the
carpet
when
presently
i
found
my
hand
held
for
a
moment
it
was
only
a
moment
but
it
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
by
the
hand
that
had
written
i
had
a
confused
impression
of
something
godlike
about
the
man
his
brow
was
magnificent
but
the
eyes
were
what
stood
out
not
that
they
were
prominent
eyes
but
they
seemed
to
look
you
through
and
through
and
had
a
lustre
there
is
no
other
word
for
it
which
i
maintain
would
have
been
far
less
dazzling
out
in
the
street
just
as
the
of
carlyle
s
eyes
would
have
been
twice
as
harrowing
in
t
s
but
even
there
neither
of
those
pairs
of
eyes
could
have
made
its
fullest
effect
the
most
terrifically
gratifying
way
of
seeing
one
s
hero
and
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
is
to
see
them
in
his
own
home
anywhere
else
believe
me
something
of
his
essence
is
forfeit
the
rose
of
roses
loses
more
or
less
of
its
beauty
in
any
vase
and
rather
more
than
less
there
in
a
nosegay
of
ordinary
little
blossoms
to
which
i
rather
rudely
liken
t
s
other
friends
the
supreme
flower
should
be
first
seen
growing
from
its
own
sharonian
soil
the
worshipper
should
have
therefore
a
letter
of
introduction
failing
that
he
should
write
a
letter
introducing
himself
a
fervid
an
idolatrous
letter
not
without
some
excuse
for
the
writing
of
it
the
hero
s
seventieth
birthday
for
instance
or
a
desire
for
light
on
some
obscure
point
in
one
of
his
earlier
works
heroes
are
very
human
most
of
them
very
easily
touched
by
praise
some
of
them
however
are
bad
at
answering
letters
the
worshipper
must
not
scruple
to
write
repeatedly
if
need
be
sooner
or
later
he
will
be
summoned
to
the
presence
this
perhaps
will
entail
a
railway
journey
heroes
tend
to
live
a
little
way
out
of
london
so
much
the
better
the
adventure
should
smack
of
pilgrimage
consider
also
that
a
house
in
a
london
street
can
not
seem
so
signally
its
owner
s
own
as
can
a
house
in
a
village
or
among
fields
the
one
kind
contains
him
the
other
enshrines
him
breathes
of
him
the
sight
of
it
after
a
walk
there
should
be
a
longish
walk
from
the
railway
station
strikes
great
initial
chords
in
the
worshipper
and
the
smaller
the
house
the
greater
the
chords
the
worshipper
pauses
at
the
gate
of
the
little
and
when
he
writes
his
autobiography
those
chords
will
be
reverberating
yet
here
it
was
that
the
greatest
of
modern
spirits
had
lived
and
wrought
here
in
the
fullness
of
years
he
abode
with
i
know
not
what
tumult
of
thoughts
i
passed
up
the
path
and
rang
the
bell
a
parlourmaid
showed
me
into
a
room
on
the
and
said
she
would
tell
the
master
i
was
here
it
was
a
wonderfully
simple
room
and
something
perhaps
the
told
me
it
was
his
the
very
room
from
which
in
the
teeth
of
the
world
s
neglect
and
misunderstanding
he
had
cast
his
spell
over
the
minds
of
all
thinking
men
and
women
when
i
had
waited
a
few
minutes
the
door
opened
and
after
that
the
deluge
of
what
was
felt
when
the
very
eminent
man
came
in
came
in
mark
you
that
is
a
vastly
important
point
had
the
very
eminent
man
been
there
at
the
outset
the
worshipper
s
first
sight
of
him
would
have
been
a
very
great
moment
certainly
but
not
nearly
so
great
as
in
fact
it
was
very
eminent
men
should
always
on
these
occasions
come
in
that
is
the
point
i
ask
them
to
remember
honourably
concerned
with
large
high
issues
they
are
not
students
of
personal
effect
i
must
therefore
explain
to
them
why
it
is
more
impressive
to
come
into
a
room
than
to
be
found
there
let
those
of
them
who
have
been
playgoers
cast
their
minds
back
to
their
experience
of
theatres
can
they
recall
a
single
play
in
which
the
principal
actor
was
discovered
sitting
or
standing
on
the
stage
when
the
curtain
rose
no
the
actor
by
the
very
nature
of
his
calling
does
must
study
personal
effect
no
playwright
would
dare
to
dump
down
his
principal
actor
at
the
outset
of
a
play
no
sensible
playwright
would
wish
to
do
so
that
actor
s
personality
is
a
part
of
the
playwright
s
material
playwriting
it
has
been
well
said
is
an
art
of
preparing
the
principal
actor
is
one
of
the
things
for
which
we
must
be
artfully
prepared
note
shakespeare
s
carefulness
in
this
matter
in
his
day
the
stage
had
no
curtain
so
that
even
the
obscure
actor
who
spoke
the
first
lines
shakespeare
himself
sometimes
maybe
was
not
ignominiously
but
an
unprepared
entry
is
no
good
the
audience
must
first
be
wrought
on
wrought
up
had
shakespeare
been
also
burbage
it
is
possible
that
he
would
have
been
even
more
painstaking
than
he
was
in
leading
up
to
the
leading
man
assuredly
by
far
the
most
tremendous
stage
entries
i
ever
saw
were
those
of
wilson
barrett
in
his
later
days
the
days
when
he
had
become
his
own
dramatist
i
remember
particularly
a
first
night
of
his
at
which
i
happened
to
be
sitting
next
to
a
clever
but
not
very
successful
and
rather
sardonic
old
actor
i
forget
just
what
great
historic
or
mythic
personage
barrett
was
to
represent
but
i
know
that
the
earlier
scenes
of
the
play
resounded
with
rumours
of
him
accounts
of
the
great
deeds
he
had
done
and
of
the
yet
greater
deeds
that
were
expected
of
him
and
at
length
there
was
a
procession
priests
bearing
wands
maidens
playing
upon
the
sackbut
guards
in
full
armour
a
of
unofficial
citizens
ever
prancing
along
the
edge
of
the
pageant
and
mostly
looking
back
over
their
shoulders
and
shading
their
eyes
maidens
strewing
and
at
last
the
orchestra
crashing
to
a
climax
in
the
nick
of
which
my
neighbour
turned
to
me
and
with
an
assumption
of
innocent
enthusiasm
whispered
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
this
were
i
suppose
barrett
at
that
instant
amply
appearing
i
gave
way
to
laughter
but
this
didn
t
matter
the
applause
would
have
drowned
a
thunderstorm
and
lasted
for
several
minutes
my
very
eminent
reader
begins
to
look
uncomfortable
let
him
take
heart
i
do
not
want
him
to
tamper
with
the
simplicity
of
his
household
arrangements
not
even
the
one
parlourmaid
need
precede
him
with
strewn
petals
all
the
necessary
preparation
will
have
been
done
by
the
bare
fact
that
this
is
his
room
and
that
he
will
presently
appear
but
he
may
say
with
a
toss
of
his
grey
beard
i
am
not
going
to
practise
any
device
whatsoever
i
am
above
devices
i
shall
be
in
the
room
when
the
young
man
i
assure
him
that
i
am
not
appealing
to
his
vanity
merely
to
his
let
him
remember
that
he
too
was
young
once
he
too
thrilled
in
harmless
let
him
not
grudge
the
young
man
an
utmost
emotion
coming
into
a
room
that
contains
a
stranger
is
a
definite
performance
a
deed
of
which
one
is
conscious
if
one
be
young
and
if
that
stranger
be
august
not
to
come
in
awkwardly
not
to
make
a
bad
impression
is
here
the
paramount
concern
the
mind
of
the
young
man
as
he
comes
in
is
clogged
with
thoughts
of
self
it
is
free
of
these
impediments
if
he
shall
have
been
waiting
alone
in
the
room
to
be
come
in
to
is
a
thing
that
needs
no
art
and
induces
no
embarrassment
one
s
whole
attention
is
focussed
on
the
one
is
the
mere
spectator
the
passive
and
receptive
receiver
and
even
supposing
that
the
young
man
could
come
in
under
his
hero
s
gaze
without
a
thought
of
self
his
first
vision
would
yet
lack
the
right
intensity
a
person
found
in
a
room
if
it
be
a
room
strange
to
the
arriver
does
not
instantly
detach
himself
from
his
surroundings
he
is
but
a
feature
of
the
scene
he
does
not
stand
out
as
against
a
background
in
the
grand
manner
of
portraiture
but
is
fused
as
in
an
elaborately
rendered
it
is
all
the
more
essential
therefore
that
the
worshipper
shall
not
have
his
first
sight
of
hero
and
room
simultaneously
the
room
must
as
it
were
be
an
anteroom
anon
converted
into
a
by
the
hero
s
entry
and
let
not
the
hero
be
in
any
fear
that
he
will
bungle
his
entry
he
has
but
to
make
it
the
effect
is
automatic
he
will
stand
out
by
merely
coming
in
i
would
but
suggest
that
he
must
not
be
he
never
so
hale
and
hearty
bounce
in
the
young
man
must
not
be
startled
if
the
mountain
had
come
to
mahomet
it
would
we
may
be
sure
have
come
slowly
that
the
prophet
should
have
time
to
realise
the
grandeur
of
the
miracle
let
the
hero
remember
that
his
coming
too
will
seem
supernatural
to
the
young
man
let
him
be
framed
for
an
instant
or
so
in
the
doorway
time
for
his
eyes
to
produce
their
peculiar
effect
and
by
the
way
if
he
be
a
wearer
of
glasses
he
should
certainly
remove
these
before
coming
in
he
can
put
them
on
again
almost
immediately
it
is
the
first
moment
that
matters
as
to
how
long
an
interval
the
hero
should
let
elapse
between
the
young
man
s
arrival
and
his
own
entry
i
can
not
offer
any
very
exact
advice
i
should
say
roughly
that
in
ten
minutes
the
young
man
would
be
strung
up
to
the
right
pitch
and
that
more
than
twenty
minutes
would
be
too
much
it
is
important
that
expectancy
shall
have
worked
on
him
to
the
full
but
it
is
still
more
important
that
his
mood
shall
not
have
been
chafed
to
impatience
the
danger
of
delay
is
well
exemplified
in
the
sad
case
of
young
coventry
patmore
in
his
old
age
patmore
wrote
to
gosse
a
description
of
a
visit
he
had
paid
at
the
age
of
eighteen
to
leigh
hunt
and
you
will
find
the
letter
on
page
vol
i
of
mr
basil
champneys
biography
of
him
the
circumstances
had
been
most
propitious
the
eager
and
sensitive
spirit
of
the
young
man
his
intense
admiration
for
the
story
of
rimini
the
letter
of
introduction
from
his
father
to
the
venerable
poet
and
friend
of
greater
bygone
poets
the
long
walk
to
hammersmith
the
small
house
in
a
square
there
all
was
classically
in
order
the
poet
was
at
home
the
visitor
as
shown
in
i
had
he
was
destined
to
tell
gosse
waited
in
the
little
parlour
at
least
two
hours
when
the
door
was
opened
and
a
most
picturesque
gentleman
with
hair
flowing
nearly
or
quite
to
his
shoulders
a
beautiful
velvet
coat
and
a
vandyck
collar
of
lace
about
a
foot
deep
appeared
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
ethereally
and
saying
without
a
word
of
preface
or
notice
of
my
having
waited
so
long
this
is
a
beautiful
world
patmore
the
young
man
was
so
taken
aback
by
these
words
that
they
eclipsed
all
memory
of
what
occurred
during
the
remainder
of
the
yet
there
was
nothing
wrong
about
the
words
themselves
indeed
to
any
one
with
any
sense
of
character
and
any
knowledge
of
leigh
hunt
they
must
seem
to
have
been
exactly
exquisitely
inevitably
the
right
words
but
they
should
have
been
said
sooner
servants
it
is
unseemly
that
a
man
should
let
any
ancestors
of
his
arise
from
their
graves
to
wait
on
his
guests
at
table
the
chinese
are
a
polite
race
and
those
of
them
who
have
visited
england
and
gone
to
dine
in
great
english
houses
will
not
have
made
this
remark
aloud
to
their
hosts
i
believe
it
is
only
their
own
ancestors
that
they
worship
so
that
they
will
not
have
felt
themselves
guilty
of
impiety
in
not
rising
from
the
table
and
rushing
out
into
the
night
nevertheless
they
must
have
been
shocked
the
french
revolution
judged
according
to
the
hope
it
was
made
in
must
be
pronounced
a
failure
it
effected
no
fundamental
change
in
human
nature
but
it
was
by
no
means
wholly
ineffectual
for
example
ladies
and
gentlemen
ceased
to
powder
their
hair
because
of
it
and
gentlemen
adopted
simpler
costumes
this
was
so
in
england
as
well
as
in
france
but
in
england
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
not
so
as
to
be
able
to
conceive
the
possibility
of
a
world
without
powder
powder
had
been
sent
down
from
heaven
and
must
not
vanish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
said
sir
john
to
his
lady
tis
a
matter
easy
to
settle
your
maid
deborah
and
the
rest
of
the
wenches
shall
powder
their
hair
whereat
his
lady
exclaimed
in
wrath
lud
sir
john
have
you
taken
leave
of
your
senses
a
parcel
of
abigails
flaunting
about
the
house
in
powder
oh
preposterous
whereat
sir
john
exclaimed
zounds
and
hotly
demonstrated
that
since
his
wife
had
given
up
powder
there
could
be
no
harm
in
its
assumption
by
her
maids
whereat
his
lady
screamed
and
had
the
vapours
and
asked
how
he
would
like
to
see
his
own
footmen
flaunting
about
the
house
in
powder
whereat
he
always
a
reasonable
man
despite
his
hasty
temper
went
out
and
told
his
footmen
to
wear
powder
henceforth
and
in
this
they
obeyed
him
and
there
arose
a
lord
of
the
treasury
saying
let
powder
be
and
it
was
so
and
the
tax
was
paid
and
powder
was
still
worn
and
there
came
the
great
reform
bill
and
the
steam
engine
and
all
manner
of
queer
things
but
powder
did
not
end
for
custom
hath
many
lives
nor
was
there
an
end
of
those
things
which
the
nobility
and
gentry
had
long
since
shed
from
their
own
persons
as
laced
coats
and
velvet
breeches
and
silk
hose
forasmuch
as
without
these
powder
could
not
aptly
be
and
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
a
great
war
and
there
was
also
a
russian
revolution
greater
than
the
french
one
and
it
may
be
that
everything
will
be
changed
fundamentally
and
soon
or
it
may
be
merely
that
sir
john
will
say
to
his
lady
my
dear
i
have
decided
that
the
footmen
shall
not
wear
powder
and
not
wear
livery
any
more
and
that
his
lady
will
say
oh
all
then
at
length
will
the
eighteenth
century
vanish
altogether
from
the
face
of
the
earth
some
of
the
shallower
historians
would
have
us
believe
that
powder
is
deleterious
to
the
race
of
footmen
they
point
out
how
plenteously
footmen
abounded
before
and
how
steadily
their
numbers
have
declined
ever
since
i
do
not
dispute
the
statistics
one
knows
from
the
table
talk
of
samuel
rogers
that
horne
tooke
dining
with
the
first
lord
lansdowne
had
counted
so
many
as
thirty
footmen
in
attendance
on
the
meal
that
was
a
high
figure
higher
than
in
rogers
day
and
higher
far
i
doubt
not
than
in
ours
what
i
refuse
to
believe
is
that
the
wearing
of
powder
has
caused
among
footmen
an
mortality
powder
was
forced
on
them
by
their
employers
because
of
the
french
revolution
but
their
subsequent
fewness
is
traceable
rather
to
certain
ideas
forced
by
that
revolution
on
their
employers
the
nobility
had
begun
to
feel
that
it
had
better
be
just
a
little
less
noble
than
heretofore
when
the
news
of
the
fall
of
the
bastille
was
brought
to
him
the
first
lord
lansdowne
i
conceive
remained
for
many
hours
in
his
study
lost
in
thought
and
at
length
rising
from
his
chair
went
out
into
the
hall
and
discharged
two
footmen
this
action
may
have
shortened
his
life
but
i
believe
it
to
be
a
fact
that
when
he
lay
dying
some
fifteen
years
later
he
said
to
his
heir
discharge
two
such
enlightenment
and
adaptability
were
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
so
eminent
a
whig
as
time
went
on
even
in
the
great
tory
houses
the
number
of
retainers
was
gradually
cut
down
came
the
industrial
age
hailed
by
all
publicists
as
the
millennium
looms
were
now
tended
and
stoked
by
men
who
in
their
youth
had
done
nothing
but
hand
salvers
and
by
young
men
who
might
have
been
doing
just
that
if
the
bastille
had
been
less
brittle
noblemen
becoming
less
and
less
sure
of
themselves
under
the
impact
of
successive
reform
bills
wished
to
be
waited
on
by
less
and
less
numerous
gatherings
of
footmen
and
at
length
in
the
course
of
the
great
war
any
nobleman
not
young
enough
to
be
away
fighting
was
waited
on
by
an
old
butler
and
a
parlourmaid
or
two
and
the
ceiling
did
not
fall
even
if
the
war
shall
have
taught
us
nothing
else
this
it
will
have
taught
us
almost
from
its
very
outset
to
mistrust
all
prophets
whether
of
good
or
of
evil
pray
stone
me
if
i
predict
anything
at
all
it
may
be
that
the
war
and
that
remarkable
the
russian
revolution
will
have
so
worked
on
the
minds
of
noblemen
that
they
will
prefer
to
have
not
one
footman
in
their
service
or
it
may
be
that
all
those
men
who
might
be
footmen
will
prefer
to
earn
their
livelihood
in
other
ways
of
life
it
may
even
be
that
no
more
parlourmaids
and
housemaids
even
for
very
illustrious
houses
will
be
forthcoming
i
do
not
profess
to
foresee
perhaps
things
will
go
on
just
as
before
but
remember
things
were
going
on
even
then
suppose
that
in
the
social
organism
generally
and
in
the
attitude
of
servants
particularly
the
decades
after
the
war
shall
bring
but
a
gradual
evolution
of
what
was
previously
afoot
even
on
this
mild
supposition
must
it
seem
likely
that
some
of
us
will
live
to
look
back
on
domestic
service
or
at
least
on
what
we
now
mean
by
that
term
as
a
curiosity
of
past
days
you
have
to
look
rather
far
behind
you
for
the
time
when
the
servant
question
as
it
is
called
had
not
yet
begun
to
arise
to
find
servants
collectively
knowing
their
place
as
the
phrase
not
is
but
was
you
have
to
look
right
back
to
the
dawn
of
queen
victoria
s
reign
i
am
not
sure
whether
even
then
those
georgian
still
stood
in
the
london
parks
to
announce
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
requested
and
servants
are
commanded
not
to
do
this
and
that
but
the
spirit
of
those
boards
did
still
brood
over
the
land
servants
received
commands
not
requests
and
were
not
obliging
but
obedient
as
for
the
tasks
set
them
i
daresay
the
footmen
in
the
great
houses
had
an
easy
time
they
were
there
for
ornament
but
the
comparatively
few
maids
there
and
the
maid
or
two
in
every
home
of
the
middle
class
were
very
much
for
use
having
to
do
an
immense
amount
of
work
for
a
wage
which
would
nowadays
seem
nominal
and
they
did
it
gladly
with
no
notion
that
they
were
giving
much
for
little
or
that
the
likes
of
them
had
any
natural
right
to
a
glimpse
of
liberty
or
to
a
moment
s
more
leisure
than
was
needed
to
preserve
their
health
for
the
benefit
of
their
employers
or
that
they
were
not
in
duty
bound
to
be
truly
thankful
for
having
a
roof
over
their
devoted
heads
rare
and
reprehensible
was
the
maid
who
having
found
one
roof
hankered
after
another
improvident
too
for
only
by
long
and
exclusive
service
could
she
hope
that
in
her
old
age
she
would
not
be
cast
out
on
the
parish
she
might
marry
meanwhile
the
chances
were
very
much
against
that
that
was
an
idea
misbeseeming
her
station
in
life
by
the
rules
of
all
households
followers
were
fended
ruthlessly
away
her
state
was
sheer
slavery
well
she
was
not
technically
a
chattel
the
law
allowed
her
to
escape
at
any
time
after
giving
a
month
s
notice
and
she
did
not
work
for
no
wages
at
all
remember
this
was
hard
on
her
owners
well
in
ancient
rome
and
elsewhere
her
employers
would
have
had
to
pay
a
sum
of
money
for
her
down
to
a
merchant
economically
her
employers
had
no
genuine
grievance
her
parents
had
handed
her
over
to
them
at
a
tender
age
for
nothing
there
she
was
and
if
she
was
a
good
girl
and
gave
satisfaction
and
if
she
had
no
gipsy
strain
to
make
her
restless
for
the
unknown
there
she
ended
her
days
not
without
honour
from
the
second
or
third
generation
of
her
owners
as
in
ancient
rome
and
elsewhere
the
system
was
in
the
long
run
conducive
to
much
good
feeling
on
either
side
poor
anne
remained
very
servile
in
soul
all
her
days
and
was
altogether
occupied
from
the
age
of
fifteen
to
in
doing
other
people
s
wills
not
her
thus
wrote
ruskin
in
praeterita
of
one
who
had
been
his
nurse
and
his
father
s
perhaps
the
passage
is
somewhat
marred
by
its
first
word
but
ruskin
had
queer
views
on
many
subjects
besides
he
was
very
old
when
in
he
wrote
praeterita
long
before
that
date
moreover
others
than
he
had
begun
to
have
queer
views
the
halcyon
days
were
over
even
in
the
sixties
there
were
many
dark
and
cumulose
clouds
it
was
believed
however
that
these
would
pass
punch
our
interpreter
made
light
of
them
absurd
that
jemima
jane
should
imitate
the
bonnets
of
her
mistress
and
secretly
aspire
to
play
the
piano
punch
and
his
artists
as
you
will
find
in
his
old
volumes
were
very
merry
about
her
and
no
doubt
his
readers
believed
that
his
exquisite
ridicule
would
kill
or
his
sound
good
sense
cure
the
malady
in
her
soul
poor
misguided
girl
why
was
she
flying
in
the
face
of
nature
nature
had
decreed
that
some
should
command
others
obey
that
some
should
sit
imperative
all
day
in
airy
parlours
and
others
be
executive
in
basements
i
daresay
that
among
the
sitters
aloft
there
were
many
whose
indignation
had
a
softer
side
to
it
under
the
christian
emperors
roman
ladies
were
really
very
sorry
for
their
slaves
it
is
unlikely
that
no
english
ladies
were
so
in
the
sixties
pity
after
all
is
in
itself
a
luxury
it
is
for
the
some
a
measure
of
the
gulf
between
themselves
and
the
those
others
had
now
begun
to
show
signs
of
restiveness
but
the
gulf
was
as
wide
as
ever
anthony
trollope
was
not
like
punch
a
mere
interpreter
of
what
was
upmost
in
the
average
english
mind
he
was
a
beautifully
patient
and
subtle
demonstrator
of
all
that
was
therein
reading
him
i
soon
forget
that
i
am
reading
about
fictitious
characters
and
careers
quite
soon
do
i
feel
that
i
am
collating
intimate
memoirs
and
diaries
for
sheer
conviction
of
truth
give
me
trollope
you
too
if
you
know
him
must
often
have
uttered
this
appeal
very
well
have
you
been
given
orley
farm
and
do
you
remember
how
lady
mason
felt
after
confessing
to
sir
peregrine
orme
that
she
had
forged
the
will
as
she
slowly
made
her
way
across
the
hall
she
felt
that
all
of
evil
all
of
punishment
had
now
fallen
upon
her
there
are
periods
in
the
lives
of
some
of
us
i
trust
but
of
few
when
with
the
silent
inner
voice
of
suffering
and
here
in
justice
to
trollope
i
must
interrupt
him
by
saying
that
he
seldom
writes
like
this
and
i
must
also
for
a
reason
which
will
soon
be
plain
ask
you
not
to
skip
a
word
we
call
on
the
mountains
to
fall
and
crush
us
and
on
the
earth
to
gape
open
and
take
us
in
when
with
an
agony
of
intensity
we
wish
our
mothers
had
been
barren
in
these
moments
the
poorest
and
most
desolate
are
objects
to
us
of
envy
for
their
sufferings
can
be
as
nothing
to
our
own
lady
mason
as
she
crept
silently
across
the
hall
saw
a
servant
girl
pass
down
towards
the
entrance
to
the
kitchen
and
would
have
given
all
all
that
she
had
in
the
world
to
change
places
with
that
girl
but
no
change
was
possible
to
her
neither
would
the
mountains
crush
her
nor
the
earth
take
her
in
this
was
her
burden
and
she
must
etc
you
enjoyed
the
wondrous
bathos
of
course
and
yet
there
wasn
t
any
bathos
at
all
really
at
least
there
wasn
t
any
in
when
orley
farm
was
published
servants
really
were
most
desolate
in
those
days
and
their
sufferings
were
less
acute
only
than
those
of
gentlewomen
who
had
forged
wills
this
is
an
exaggerated
view
well
it
was
the
view
held
by
gentlewomen
at
large
in
the
sixties
trust
trollope
why
to
a
modern
gentlewoman
would
it
seem
so
much
more
dreadful
to
be
crushed
by
mountains
and
swallowed
by
earthquakes
than
to
be
a
servant
girl
passing
down
towards
the
entrance
to
the
kitchen
in
other
words
how
is
it
that
servants
have
so
much
less
unpleasant
a
time
than
they
were
having
ago
i
should
like
to
think
this
melioration
came
through
our
sense
of
justice
but
i
can
not
claim
that
it
did
somehow
our
sense
of
justice
never
turns
in
its
sleep
till
long
after
the
sense
of
injustice
in
others
has
been
thoroughly
aroused
nor
is
it
ever
up
and
doing
till
those
others
have
begun
to
make
themselves
thoroughly
disagreeable
and
not
even
then
will
it
be
up
and
doing
more
than
is
urgently
required
of
it
by
our
convenience
at
the
moment
for
the
improvement
in
their
lot
servants
must
i
am
afraid
be
allowed
to
thank
themselves
rather
than
their
employers
i
am
not
going
to
trace
the
stages
of
that
improvement
i
will
not
try
to
decide
in
what
year
servants
passed
from
wistfulness
to
resentment
or
from
resentment
to
exaction
this
is
not
a
sociological
treatise
it
is
just
an
essay
and
i
claim
an
essayist
s
privilege
of
not
groping
through
the
library
of
the
british
museum
on
the
chance
of
mastering
all
the
details
i
confess
that
i
did
go
there
yesterday
thinking
i
should
find
in
and
sidney
webb
s
history
of
trade
unionism
the
means
of
appearing
to
know
much
but
i
drew
blank
it
would
seem
that
servants
have
no
trade
union
this
is
strange
one
would
not
have
thought
so
much
could
be
done
without
organisation
the
mere
spirit
of
the
time
sneaking
down
the
steps
of
areas
has
worked
wonders
there
has
been
no
servants
campaign
no
strategy
nothing
but
an
infinite
series
of
spontaneous
and
sporadic
little
risings
in
isolated
households
wonders
have
been
worked
yes
but
servants
are
not
yet
satiated
with
triumph
more
and
more
on
the
contrary
do
they
glide
long
before
the
war
they
had
begun
gliding
away
into
other
forms
of
employment
not
merely
are
the
changed
conditions
of
domestic
service
not
changed
enough
for
them
they
seem
to
despise
the
thing
itself
it
was
all
very
well
so
long
as
they
had
not
been
taught
to
read
and
write
but
there
no
doubt
is
the
root
of
the
mischief
had
the
governing
classes
not
forced
those
accomplishments
on
them
in
but
there
is
no
use
in
repining
what
s
done
can
t
be
undone
on
the
other
hand
what
must
be
done
can
t
be
left
undone
housework
for
example
what
concessions
by
the
governing
classes
what
bribes
will
be
big
enough
hereafter
to
get
that
done
perhaps
the
governing
classes
will
do
it
for
themselves
eventually
and
their
ceilings
not
fall
or
perhaps
there
will
be
no
more
governing
classes
merely
the
state
and
its
swarms
of
neat
little
overseers
male
and
female
i
know
not
whether
in
this
case
the
sum
of
human
happiness
will
be
greater
but
it
will
certainly
it
and
the
sum
of
human
dullness
be
more
evenly
distributed
i
take
it
that
under
any
scheme
of
industrial
compulsion
for
the
young
a
certain
number
of
the
conscripts
would
be
told
off
for
domestic
service
to
every
family
in
every
flat
houses
not
legal
would
be
assigned
one
female
member
of
the
community
she
would
be
twenty
years
old
having
just
finished
her
course
of
general
education
at
a
municipal
college
three
years
would
be
her
term
of
industrial
domestic
service
her
diet
her
costume
her
hours
of
work
and
leisure
would
be
standardised
but
the
lenses
of
her
would
be
in
strict
accordance
to
her
own
eyesight
if
her
employers
found
her
faulty
in
work
or
conduct
and
proved
to
the
visiting
inspector
that
she
was
so
she
would
be
penalised
by
an
additional
term
of
service
if
she
on
the
other
hand
made
good
any
complaint
against
her
employers
she
would
be
transferred
to
another
flat
and
they
be
penalised
by
suspension
of
their
license
to
employ
there
would
always
be
chances
of
friction
but
these
chances
would
not
be
so
numerous
nor
so
great
as
they
are
under
that
lack
of
system
which
survives
servants
would
be
persons
knowing
that
for
a
certain
period
certain
tasks
were
imposed
on
them
tasks
tantamount
to
those
in
which
all
their
coevals
were
simultaneously
engaged
they
are
persons
not
knowing
as
who
should
say
where
they
are
and
wishing
all
the
while
they
were
elsewhere
and
mostly
as
i
have
said
going
elsewhere
those
who
remain
grow
more
and
more
touchy
knowing
themselves
a
mock
to
the
rest
and
their
qualms
even
more
uncomfortably
than
their
demands
and
defects
are
always
haunting
their
employers
it
seems
almost
incredible
that
there
was
a
time
when
smith
said
sarah
your
master
wishes
or
smith
said
sarah
go
up
and
ask
your
mistress
whether
i
am
well
aware
that
the
very
title
of
this
essay
jars
i
wish
i
could
find
another
but
in
writing
one
must
be
more
explicit
than
one
need
be
by
word
of
mouth
i
am
well
aware
that
the
survival
of
domestic
service
in
its
old
form
depends
more
and
more
on
our
agreement
not
to
mention
it
assuredly
a
most
uncomfortable
state
of
things
is
it
after
all
worth
saving
a
form
so
depleted
of
right
human
substance
an
anomaly
so
ticklish
consider
in
your
friend
s
house
the
cheerful
smile
of
yonder
parlourmaid
hark
to
the
housemaid
s
light
brisk
tread
in
the
corridor
note
well
the
slight
droop
of
the
footman
s
shoulders
as
he
noiselessly
draws
near
such
things
as
being
traditional
may
pander
to
your
sense
of
the
great
past
histrionically
too
they
are
good
but
do
you
really
like
them
do
they
not
make
your
blood
run
a
trifle
cold
in
the
thick
of
the
great
past
you
would
have
liked
them
well
enough
no
doubt
i
myself
am
old
enough
to
have
known
two
or
three
servants
of
the
old
school
later
editions
of
ruskin
s
anne
with
them
there
was
no
discomfort
for
they
had
no
misgiving
they
had
never
wished
heaven
help
them
for
more
and
in
the
process
of
the
long
years
had
acquired
for
inspiration
of
others
much
a
fine
mellowness
the
peculiar
sort
of
dignity
even
of
wisdom
that
comes
only
of
staying
always
in
the
same
place
among
the
same
people
doing
the
same
things
perpetually
theirs
was
the
sap
that
rises
only
from
deep
roots
and
where
they
were
you
had
always
the
sense
of
standing
under
great
wide
branches
one
especially
would
i
recall
who
no
personally
i
admire
the
plungingly
intimate
kind
of
essayist
very
much
indeed
but
i
never
was
of
that
kind
and
it
s
too
late
to
begin
now
for
a
type
of
servant
i
would
recall
rather
some
more
public
worthy
such
as
that
stout
old
hostler
whom
whenever
you
went
up
to
stay
in
hampstead
you
would
see
standing
planted
outside
that
stout
old
hostelry
jack
straw
s
castle
he
stands
there
no
more
and
the
hostelry
can
never
again
be
to
me
all
that
it
was
of
solid
comfort
or
perhaps
as
he
was
so
entirely
an
outside
figure
i
might
rather
say
that
hampstead
itself
is
not
what
it
was
his
robust
but
restful
form
topped
with
that
and
face
was
the
hub
of
the
summit
of
hampstead
he
was
as
richly
local
as
the
pond
there
that
famous
pond
which
in
hot
weather
is
so
much
waded
through
by
and
is
at
all
seasons
so
much
barked
around
by
excitable
dogs
and
cruised
on
by
toy
boats
he
was
as
essential
as
it
and
the
and
the
gorse
and
the
view
over
the
valley
away
to
highgate
it
was
always
to
highgate
that
his
big
blue
eyes
were
looking
and
on
highgate
that
he
seemed
to
be
ruminating
not
that
i
think
he
wanted
to
go
there
he
was
and
and
very
loyal
to
that
village
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
had
bin
down
to
london
a
matter
o
three
or
four
times
he
would
tell
me
an
slep
there
he
knew
me
to
be
a
native
of
that
city
and
for
he
was
the
most
respectful
of
men
did
not
make
any
adverse
criticism
of
it
but
clearly
it
had
not
prepossessed
him
men
and
horses
rather
than
cities
were
what
he
knew
and
his
memory
was
more
retentive
of
horses
than
of
men
but
he
did
and
this
was
a
great
thrill
for
me
did
after
some
pondering
at
my
behest
remember
to
have
seen
in
heath
street
when
he
was
a
boy
a
gen
leman
with
summut
long
hair
settin
in
a
small
cart
takin
a
pictur
to
me
ford
madox
brown
s
work
is
of
all
modern
pictur
s
the
most
delightful
in
composition
and
strongest
in
conception
the
most
alive
and
the
most
and
i
take
great
pride
in
having
known
some
one
who
saw
it
in
the
making
but
my
friend
himself
set
little
store
on
anything
that
had
befallen
him
in
days
before
he
was
took
on
as
at
the
his
pride
was
in
the
castle
wholly
part
of
his
charm
like
hampstead
s
was
in
the
surprise
one
had
at
finding
anything
like
it
so
near
to
london
even
now
if
you
go
to
districts
near
which
no
great
towns
are
you
will
find
here
and
there
an
inn
that
has
a
devoted
waiter
a
house
with
a
fond
butler
as
to
butlers
elsewhere
butlers
in
general
there
is
one
thing
about
them
that
i
do
not
at
all
understand
it
seems
to
be
against
nature
yet
it
is
a
fact
that
in
the
past
forty
years
they
have
been
growing
younger
and
slimmer
in
my
childhood
they
were
old
without
exception
and
stout
at
the
close
of
the
last
century
they
had
gradually
relapsed
into
middle
age
losing
weight
all
the
time
and
in
the
years
that
followed
they
were
passing
back
behind
the
prime
of
life
becoming
willowy
juveniles
in
it
is
true
the
work
of
past
decades
was
undone
butlers
were
suddenly
as
old
and
stout
as
ever
they
were
and
so
they
still
are
but
this
i
take
it
is
only
a
temporary
setback
at
the
restoration
of
peace
butlers
will
reappear
among
us
as
they
were
in
and
anon
will
be
losing
height
and
weight
too
till
they
shall
have
become
children
with
pattering
feet
or
will
their
childhood
be
of
a
less
gracious
kind
than
that
i
fear
so
i
have
seen
from
time
to
time
butlers
who
had
shed
all
semblance
of
grace
butlers
whose
whole
demeanour
was
a
manifesto
of
contempt
for
their
calling
and
of
devotion
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
i
have
seen
a
butler
in
a
household
strolling
around
the
diners
without
the
slightest
droop
and
pouring
out
wine
in
an
and
quite
obviously
hostile
manner
i
have
seen
him
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
yawning
i
remember
another
whom
positively
i
heard
humming
a
faint
sound
indeed
but
menacing
as
the
roll
of
tumbrils
these
were
exceptional
cases
i
grant
for
the
most
part
the
butlers
observed
by
me
have
had
a
manner
as
correctly
smooth
and
colourless
as
their
very
aye
and
in
two
or
three
of
them
modern
though
they
were
in
date
and
aspect
i
could
have
sworn
there
was
a
flame
of
fealty
all
were
these
but
the
finer
comedians
there
was
one
i
will
call
him
brett
who
had
an
almost
way
of
watching
his
master
was
this
but
a
calculated
touch
in
a
merely
aesthetic
whole
brett
was
tall
and
slender
and
his
movements
were
those
of
a
greyhound
under
perfect
baldness
at
the
temples
enhanced
the
solemnity
of
his
thin
smooth
face
it
is
more
than
twenty
years
since
first
i
saw
him
and
for
a
long
period
i
saw
him
often
both
in
town
and
in
country
against
the
background
of
either
house
he
was
impeccable
many
butlers
might
be
that
brett
s
supremacy
was
in
the
sense
he
gave
one
that
he
was
after
all
human
that
he
had
a
heart
in
which
he
had
taken
the
liberty
to
reserve
a
corner
for
any
true
friend
of
his
master
and
mistress
i
remember
well
the
first
time
he
overstepped
sheer
formality
in
relation
to
myself
it
was
one
morning
in
the
country
when
my
entertainers
and
my
fellow
guests
had
gone
out
in
pursuit
of
some
sport
at
which
i
was
no
good
i
was
in
the
smoking
room
reading
a
book
suddenly
no
brett
never
appeared
anywhere
suddenly
brett
appeared
paused
at
precisely
the
right
speaking
distance
and
said
in
a
low
voice
i
thought
it
might
interest
you
to
know
sir
that
there
s
a
magpie
out
on
the
lawn
very
rare
as
you
know
sir
if
you
look
out
of
the
window
you
will
see
the
little
fellow
hopping
about
on
the
i
thanked
him
effusively
as
i
darted
to
the
window
and
simulated
an
intense
interest
in
the
little
i
greatly
overdid
my
part
exit
brett
having
done
his
to
perfection
what
worries
me
is
not
that
i
showed
so
little
and
so
much
insincerity
but
the
doubt
whether
brett
s
flawless
technique
was
the
vehicle
for
an
act
of
true
good
feeling
or
was
used
simply
for
the
pleasure
of
using
it
similar
doubts
abide
in
all
my
special
memories
of
him
there
was
an
evening
when
he
seemed
to
lose
control
over
himself
but
did
he
really
lose
it
there
were
only
four
people
at
dinner
my
host
his
wife
their
nephew
a
young
man
famous
for
drollery
and
myself
towards
the
end
of
dinner
the
conversation
had
turned
on
early
marriages
i
said
the
young
man
presently
shall
not
marry
till
i
am
seventy
i
shall
then
marry
some
charming
girl
of
his
aunt
threw
up
her
hands
exclaiming
oh
tom
what
a
perfectly
horrible
idea
why
she
isn
t
born
yet
no
said
the
young
man
but
i
have
my
eye
on
her
at
this
brett
who
was
holding
a
light
for
his
master
s
cigarette
turned
away
convulsively
with
a
sudden
dip
of
the
head
and
vanished
from
the
room
his
breakdown
touched
and
pleased
all
four
beholders
but
was
it
a
genuine
lapse
or
merely
a
feint
to
thrill
us
the
feint
of
an
equilibrist
so
secure
that
he
can
pretend
to
lose
his
balance
if
i
knew
why
brett
ceased
to
be
butler
in
that
household
i
might
be
in
less
doubt
as
to
the
true
inwardness
of
him
i
knew
only
that
he
was
gone
that
was
fully
ten
years
ago
since
then
i
have
had
one
glimpse
of
him
this
was
on
a
summer
night
in
london
i
had
gone
out
late
to
visit
some
relatives
and
assure
myself
that
they
were
safe
and
sound
for
zeppelins
had
just
passed
over
london
for
the
first
time
not
so
much
horror
as
a
very
deep
disgust
was
the
atmosphere
in
the
populous
quiet
streets
and
squares
one
square
was
less
quiet
than
others
because
somebody
was
steadily
whistling
for
a
taxi
anon
i
saw
the
whistler
silhouetted
in
the
light
cast
out
on
a
wide
doorstep
from
an
open
door
and
i
saw
that
he
was
brett
his
attitude
as
he
bent
out
into
the
dark
night
was
perfect
in
grace
but
eloquent
of
a
great
tensity
even
of
agony
behind
him
stood
a
lady
in
an
elaborate
evening
cloak
brett
s
back
must
have
conveyed
to
her
in
every
curve
his
surprise
his
shame
that
she
should
be
kept
waiting
his
chivalry
in
her
behalf
was
such
as
burke
s
for
marie
antoinette
little
had
he
dreamed
that
he
should
have
lived
to
see
such
disasters
fallen
upon
her
in
a
nation
of
gallant
men
in
a
nation
of
men
of
honour
and
of
cavaliers
he
had
thought
ten
thousand
taxis
must
have
leaped
from
their
stands
etc
the
whistle
that
at
first
sounded
merely
mechanical
and
had
become
heartrending
and
human
when
i
saw
from
whom
it
proceeded
a
very
that
still
haunts
me
but
was
it
a
was
brett
is
brett
more
than
a
mere
virtuoso
he
is
in
any
case
what
employers
call
a
treasure
and
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
go
forth
and
hunt
for
him
i
will
supply
a
chart
showing
the
way
to
that
doorstep
on
which
last
i
saw
him
but
i
myself
were
i
ever
so
able
to
pay
his
wages
should
never
covet
him
no
nor
anything
like
him
perhaps
we
are
not
afraid
of
menservants
if
we
look
out
at
them
from
the
cradle
none
was
visible
from
mine
only
in
later
years
and
under
external
auspices
did
i
come
across
any
of
them
and
i
am
as
afraid
of
them
as
ever
maidservants
frighten
me
less
but
they
also
except
the
two
or
three
ancients
aforesaid
have
always
struck
some
degree
of
terror
to
my
soul
the
whole
notion
of
domestic
service
has
never
not
seemed
to
me
unnatural
i
take
no
credit
for
enlightenment
not
to
have
the
instinct
to
command
implies
a
lack
of
the
instinct
to
obey
the
two
aptitudes
are
but
different
facets
of
one
jewel
the
sense
of
order
when
i
became
a
schoolboy
i
greatly
disliked
being
a
monitor
s
fag
other
fags
there
were
who
took
pride
in
the
quality
of
the
toast
they
made
for
the
breakfasts
and
suppers
of
their
superiors
my
own
feeling
was
that
i
would
rather
eat
it
myself
and
that
if
i
mightn
t
eat
it
myself
i
would
rather
it
were
not
very
good
similarly
when
i
grew
to
have
fags
of
my
own
and
by
morning
and
by
evening
one
of
them
solemnly
entered
to
me
bearing
a
plate
on
which
those
three
traditional
pieces
of
toast
were
solemnly
propped
one
against
another
i
cared
not
at
all
whether
the
toast
were
good
or
bad
having
no
relish
for
it
at
best
but
could
have
eaten
with
gusto
toast
made
by
my
own
hand
not
at
all
understanding
why
that
member
should
be
accounted
too
august
for
such
employment
even
so
in
my
later
life
loth
to
obey
loth
to
command
convention
for
she
too
frightens
me
has
made
me
accept
what
servants
would
do
for
me
by
rote
but
i
would
liefer
have
it
than
ask
even
the
least
mettlesome
of
them
to
do
it
better
and
far
liefer
if
they
would
only
be
off
and
not
do
it
at
all
do
it
for
myself
in
italy
dear
italy
where
i
have
lived
much
servants
do
still
regard
service
somewhat
in
the
old
way
as
a
sort
of
privilege
so
that
with
italian
servants
i
am
comparatively
at
my
ease
but
oh
the
delight
when
on
the
afternoon
of
some
local
festa
there
is
no
servant
at
all
in
the
little
house
oh
the
reaction
the
impulse
to
sing
and
dance
and
the
positive
quick
obedience
to
that
impulse
convention
alone
has
forced
me
to
be
anywhere
a
master
ariel
and
caliban
had
i
been
prospero
on
that
island
would
have
had
nothing
to
do
and
nothing
to
complain
of
and
man
friday
on
that
other
island
would
have
bored
me
had
i
been
crusoe
when
i
was
a
king
in
babylon
and
you
were
a
christian
slave
i
promptly
freed
you
anarchistic
yes
and
i
have
no
defence
to
offer
except
the
rather
lame
one
that
i
am
a
tory
anarchist
i
should
like
every
one
to
go
about
doing
just
as
he
pleased
short
of
altering
any
of
the
things
to
which
i
have
grown
accustomed
domestic
service
is
not
one
of
those
things
and
i
should
be
glad
were
there
no
more
of
it
going
out
for
a
walk
it
is
a
fact
that
not
once
in
all
my
life
have
i
gone
out
for
a
walk
i
have
been
taken
out
for
walks
but
that
is
another
matter
even
while
i
trotted
prattling
by
my
nurse
s
side
i
regretted
the
good
old
days
when
i
had
and
wasn
t
a
perambulator
when
i
grew
up
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
one
advantage
of
living
in
london
was
that
nobody
ever
wanted
me
to
come
out
for
a
walk
london
s
very
drawbacks
its
endless
noise
and
hustle
its
smoky
air
the
squalor
ambushed
everywhere
in
it
assured
this
one
immunity
whenever
i
was
with
friends
in
the
country
i
knew
that
at
any
moment
unless
rain
were
actually
falling
some
man
might
suddenly
say
come
out
for
a
walk
in
that
sharp
imperative
tone
which
he
would
not
dream
of
using
in
any
other
connexion
people
seem
to
think
there
is
something
inherently
noble
and
virtuous
in
the
desire
to
go
for
a
walk
any
one
thus
desirous
feels
that
he
has
a
right
to
impose
his
will
on
whomever
he
sees
comfortably
settled
in
an
reading
it
is
easy
to
say
simply
no
to
an
old
friend
in
the
case
of
a
mere
acquaintance
one
wants
some
excuse
i
wish
i
could
but
nothing
ever
occurs
to
me
except
i
have
some
letters
to
this
formula
is
unsatisfactory
in
three
ways
it
isn
t
believed
it
compels
you
to
rise
from
your
chair
go
to
the
and
sit
improvising
a
letter
to
somebody
until
the
walkmonger
just
not
daring
to
call
you
liar
and
hypocrite
shall
have
lumbered
out
of
the
room
it
won
t
operate
on
sunday
mornings
there
s
no
post
out
till
this
evening
clinches
the
matter
and
you
may
as
well
go
quietly
walking
for
walking
s
sake
may
be
as
highly
laudable
and
exemplary
a
thing
as
it
is
held
to
be
by
those
who
practise
it
my
objection
to
it
is
that
it
stops
the
brain
many
a
man
has
professed
to
me
that
his
brain
never
works
so
well
as
when
he
is
swinging
along
the
high
road
or
over
hill
and
dale
this
boast
is
not
confirmed
by
my
memory
of
anybody
who
on
a
sunday
morning
has
forced
me
to
partake
of
his
adventure
experience
teaches
me
that
whatever
a
may
have
of
power
to
instruct
or
to
amuse
when
he
is
sitting
on
a
chair
or
standing
on
a
quickly
leaves
him
when
he
takes
one
out
for
a
walk
the
ideas
that
came
so
thick
and
fast
to
him
in
any
room
where
are
they
now
where
that
encyclopiedic
knowledge
which
he
bore
so
lightly
where
the
kindling
fancy
that
played
like
summer
lightning
over
any
topic
that
was
started
the
man
s
face
that
was
so
mobile
is
set
now
gone
is
the
light
from
his
fine
eyes
he
says
that
a
our
host
is
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
fifty
yards
further
on
he
adds
that
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
he
has
ever
met
we
tramp
another
furlong
or
so
and
he
says
that
is
a
charming
woman
presently
he
adds
that
she
is
one
of
the
most
charming
women
he
has
ever
known
we
pass
an
inn
he
reads
vapidly
aloud
to
me
the
king
s
arms
licensed
to
sell
ales
and
i
foresee
that
during
the
rest
of
the
walk
he
will
read
aloud
any
inscription
that
occurs
we
pass
a
milestone
he
points
at
it
with
his
stick
and
says
uxminster
we
turn
a
sharp
corner
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
he
points
at
the
wall
and
says
drive
i
see
far
ahead
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
bordering
the
high
road
a
small
he
sees
it
too
he
keeps
his
eye
on
it
and
in
due
course
trespassers
he
says
will
be
poor
man
mentally
a
wreck
luncheon
at
the
a
s
however
salves
him
and
floats
him
in
full
sail
behold
him
once
more
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
surely
he
will
never
after
the
bitter
lesson
of
this
morning
go
out
for
another
walk
an
hour
later
i
see
him
striding
forth
with
a
new
companion
i
watch
him
out
of
sight
i
know
what
he
is
saying
he
is
saying
that
i
am
rather
a
dull
man
to
go
a
walk
with
he
will
presently
add
that
i
am
one
of
the
dullest
men
he
ever
went
a
walk
with
then
he
will
devote
himself
to
reading
out
the
inscriptions
how
comes
it
this
immediate
deterioration
in
those
who
go
walking
for
walking
s
sake
just
what
happens
i
take
it
that
not
by
his
reasoning
faculties
is
a
man
urged
to
this
enterprise
he
is
urged
evidently
by
something
in
him
that
transcends
reason
by
his
soul
i
presume
yes
it
must
be
the
soul
that
raps
out
the
quick
march
to
the
halt
stand
at
ease
interposes
the
brain
and
to
what
destination
it
suavely
asks
the
soul
and
on
what
errand
are
you
sending
the
body
on
no
errand
whatsoever
the
soul
makes
answer
and
to
no
destination
at
all
it
is
just
like
you
to
be
always
on
the
for
some
subtle
ulterior
motive
the
body
is
going
out
because
the
mere
fact
of
its
doing
so
is
a
sure
indication
of
nobility
probity
and
rugged
grandeur
of
very
well
vagula
have
your
own
wayula
but
i
says
the
brain
flatly
refuse
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
tomfoolery
i
shall
go
to
sleep
till
it
is
the
brain
then
wraps
itself
up
in
its
own
convolutions
and
falls
into
a
dreamless
slumber
from
which
nothing
can
rouse
it
till
the
body
has
been
safely
deposited
indoors
again
even
if
you
go
to
some
definite
place
for
some
definite
purpose
the
brain
would
rather
you
took
a
vehicle
but
it
does
not
make
a
point
of
this
it
will
serve
you
well
enough
unless
you
are
going
for
a
walk
it
won
t
while
your
legs
are
vying
with
each
other
do
any
deep
thinking
for
you
nor
even
any
close
thinking
but
it
will
do
any
number
of
small
odd
jobs
for
you
willingly
provided
that
your
legs
also
are
making
themselves
useful
not
merely
bandying
you
about
to
gratify
the
pride
of
the
soul
such
as
it
is
this
essay
was
composed
in
the
course
of
a
walk
this
morning
i
am
not
one
of
those
extremists
who
must
have
a
vehicle
to
every
destination
i
never
go
out
of
my
way
as
it
were
to
avoid
exercise
i
take
it
as
it
comes
and
take
it
in
good
part
that
valetudinarians
are
always
chattering
about
it
and
indulging
in
it
to
excess
is
no
reason
for
despising
it
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
in
moderation
it
is
rather
good
for
one
physically
but
pending
a
time
when
no
people
wish
me
to
go
and
see
them
and
i
have
no
wish
to
go
and
see
any
one
and
there
is
nothing
whatever
for
me
to
do
off
my
own
premises
i
never
will
go
out
for
a
walk
quia
imperfectum
i
have
often
wondered
that
no
one
has
set
himself
to
collect
unfinished
works
of
art
there
is
a
peculiar
charm
for
all
of
us
in
that
which
was
still
in
the
making
when
its
maker
died
or
in
that
which
he
laid
aside
because
he
was
tired
of
it
or
didn
t
see
his
way
to
the
end
of
it
or
wanted
to
go
on
to
something
else
pickwick
and
the
ancient
mariner
are
valued
friends
of
ours
but
they
do
not
preoccupy
us
like
edwin
drood
or
kubla
khan
had
that
revolving
chair
at
gad
s
hill
become
empty
but
a
few
weeks
later
than
it
actually
did
or
had
samuel
taylor
coleridge
in
the
act
of
setting
down
his
dream
about
the
eastern
potentate
not
been
interrupted
by
a
person
on
business
from
porlock
and
so
lost
the
thread
of
the
thing
for
ever
from
two
what
delightful
glades
for
roaming
in
would
our
fancy
be
excluded
the
very
globe
we
live
on
is
a
far
more
fascinating
sphere
than
it
can
have
been
when
men
supposed
that
men
like
themselves
would
be
on
it
to
the
end
of
time
it
is
only
since
we
heard
what
darwin
had
to
say
only
since
we
have
had
to
accept
as
improvisible
what
lies
far
ahead
that
the
book
of
life
has
taken
so
strong
a
hold
on
us
and
once
taken
up
can
not
as
the
reviewers
say
readily
be
laid
the
work
doesn
t
strike
us
as
a
masterpiece
yet
certainly
but
who
knows
that
it
isn
t
that
it
won
t
be
judged
as
a
whole
for
sheer
creativeness
no
human
artist
i
take
it
has
a
higher
repute
than
michael
angelo
none
perhaps
has
a
repute
so
high
but
what
if
michael
angelo
had
been
a
little
more
persevering
all
those
years
he
spent
in
the
process
of
just
to
begin
pope
julius
tomb
and
again
all
those
blank
spaces
for
his
pictures
and
bare
pedestals
for
his
statues
in
the
baptistery
of
san
lorenzo
ought
we
to
regret
them
quite
so
passionately
as
we
do
his
patrons
were
apt
to
think
him
an
impossible
person
to
deal
with
but
i
suspect
that
there
may
have
been
a
certain
high
cunning
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
mere
lovable
fault
of
temperament
when
michael
angelo
actually
did
bring
a
thing
off
the
result
was
not
always
more
than
magnificent
his
david
is
magnificent
but
it
isn
t
david
one
is
duly
awed
but
to
see
the
master
at
his
best
back
one
goes
from
the
accademia
to
that
marvellous
bleak
baptistery
which
he
left
that
we
should
see
in
the
mind
s
eye
just
that
very
best
it
was
there
some
years
ago
as
i
stood
before
the
marvel
of
the
night
and
morning
that
i
first
conceived
the
idea
of
a
museum
of
incomplete
masterpieces
and
now
i
mean
to
organise
the
thing
on
my
own
account
the
baptistery
itself
so
full
of
unfulfilment
and
with
such
a
wealth
at
present
of
spare
space
will
be
the
ideal
setting
for
my
treasures
there
be
it
that
the
public
shall
throng
to
steep
itself
in
the
splendour
of
possibilities
beholding
under
glass
and
perhaps
in
excellent
preservation
penelope
s
web
and
the
original
designs
for
the
tower
of
babel
the
draft
made
by
asquith
for

and
the
notes
jotted
down
by
the
sometime
german
emperor
for
a
proclamation
from

to

of

an

of

anyhow
it
is
my

among

rossetti

to
which
if

can
find

and
acquire

a
special
place
of
honour
shall
be

huge
picture
in
which

sits
on
a
fallen
obelisk
and
surveys
the
ruined
temples
of

campagna

the
reader
knits
his
brow
evidently
he
has
not
just
been
reading
goethe
s
travels
in
i
have
or
rather
i
have
just
been
reading
a
translation
of
it
published
in
by
george
bell
sons
i
daresay
it
isn
t
a
very
good
translation
for
one
has
always
understood
that
goethe
despite
a
resistant
medium
wrote
well
an
accomplishment
which
this
translator
hardly
wins
one
to
suspect
and
i
daresay
the
painting
i
so
want
to
see
and
have
isn
t
a
very
good
painting
wilhelm
tischbein
is
hardly
a
name
to
conjure
with
though
in
his
day
as
a
practitioner
in
the
historical
style
and
as
a
rapturous
resident
in
rome
tischbein
did
great
things
big
things
at
any
rate
he
did
crowds
of
heroes
in
helmets
looked
down
at
by
gods
on
clouds
he
did
centaurs
leaping
ravines
sabine
women
sieges
of
troy
and
he
did
this
portrait
of
goethe
at
least
he
began
it
why
didn
t
he
finish
it
that
is
a
problem
as
to
which
one
can
but
hazard
guesses
reading
between
the
lines
of
goethe
s
letters
the
great
point
is
that
it
never
was
finished
by
that
point
as
you
read
between
those
lines
you
will
be
amused
if
you
are
unkind
and
worried
if
you
are
humane
worried
yet
also
pleased
goethe
has
more
than
once
been
described
as
the
perfect
he
was
assuredly
a
personage
on
the
great
scale
in
the
grand
manner
gloriously
balanced
rounded
and
it
is
a
fact
that
he
was
not
made
of
marble
he
started
with
all
the
disadvantages
of
flesh
and
blood
and
retained
them
to
the
last
yet
from
no
angle
as
he
went
his
long
way
could
it
be
plausibly
hinted
that
he
wasn
t
sublime
endearing
though
failure
always
is
we
grudge
no
man
a
moderately
successful
career
and
glory
itself
we
will
wink
at
if
it
befall
some
thoroughly
good
fellow
but
a
man
whose
career
was
glorious
without
intermission
decade
after
decade
does
sorely
try
our
patience
he
we
know
can
not
have
been
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
of
goethe
we
are
shy
for
such
reasons
as
that
he
was
never
injudicious
never
lazy
always
in
his
best
form
and
always
in
love
with
some
lady
or
another
just
so
much
as
was
good
for
the
development
of
his
soul
and
his
art
but
never
more
than
that
by
a
tittle
fate
decreed
that
sir
willoughby
patterne
should
cut
a
ridiculous
figure
and
so
earn
our
forgiveness
fate
may
have
had
a
similar
plan
for
goethe
if
so
it
went
all
agley
yet
in
the
course
of
that
pageant
his
career
there
did
happen
just
one
humiliation
one
thing
that
needed
to
be
hushed
up
there
tischbein
s
defalcation
was
a
chip
in
the
marble
a
flaw
in
the
crystal
just
one
thread
loose
in
the
great
grand
tapestry
men
of
genius
are
not
quick
judges
of
character
deep
thinking
and
high
imagining
blunt
that
trivial
instinct
by
which
you
and
i
size
people
up
had
you
and
i
been
at
goethe
s
elbow
when
in
the
october
of
he
entered
rome
and
was
received
by
the
excited
tischbein
no
doubt
we
should
have
whispered
in
his
ear
beware
of
that
man
he
will
one
day
fail
unassisted
goethe
had
no
misgivings
for
some
years
he
had
been
receiving
letters
from
this
herr
tischbein
they
were
the
letters
of
a
man
steeped
in
the
sorrows
of
werther
and
in
all
else
that
goethe
had
written
this
was
a
matter
of
course
but
also
they
were
the
letters
of
a
man
familiar
with
all
the
treasures
of
rome
all
italy
was
desirable
but
it
was
especially
towards
great
rome
that
the
soul
of
the
illustrious
poet
the
confined
state
councillor
of
weimar
had
been
ever
yearning
so
that
when
came
the
day
and
the
duke
gave
leave
of
absence
and
goethe
closing
his
official
portfolio
with
a
snap
and
imprinting
a
fervent
but
hasty
kiss
on
the
hand
of
frau
von
stein
fared
forth
on
his
pilgrimage
tischbein
was
a
prospect
inseparably
bound
up
for
him
with
that
of
the
seven
hills
baedeker
had
not
been
born
tischbein
would
be
a
great
saviour
of
time
and
trouble
nor
was
this
hope
unfulfilled
tischbein
was
assiduous
enthusiastic
indefatigable
in
the
early
letters
to
frau
von
stein
to
herder
and
others
his
name
is
always
cropping
up
for
commendation
of
tischbein
i
have
much
to
say
and
much
to
boast
a
thorough
and
original
german
he
has
always
been
thinking
of
me
ever
providing
for
my
wants
in
his
society
all
my
enjoyments
are
more
than
he
was
years
old
two
years
younger
than
goethe
and
one
guesses
him
to
have
been
a
stocky
little
man
with
those
short
thick
legs
which
denote
indefatigability
one
guesses
him
blond
and
rosy
very
voluble
very
guttural
with
a
wealth
of
forceful
but
not
graceful
gesture
one
is
on
safer
ground
in
guessing
him
vastly
proud
of
trotting
goethe
round
such
fame
throughout
europe
had
goethe
won
by
his
works
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
travel
incognito
not
that
his
identity
wasn
t
an
open
secret
nor
that
he
himself
would
have
wished
it
hid
great
artists
are
always
vain
to
say
that
a
man
is
vain
means
merely
that
he
is
pleased
with
the
effect
he
produces
on
other
people
a
conceited
man
is
satisfied
with
the
effect
he
produces
on
himself
any
great
artist
is
far
too
perceptive
and
too
exigent
to
be
satisfied
with
that
effect
and
hence
in
vanity
he
seeks
solace
goethe
you
may
be
sure
enjoyed
the
gaze
focussed
on
him
from
all
the
tables
of
the
caffe
greco
but
not
for
adulation
had
he
come
to
rome
rome
was
what
he
had
come
for
and
the
fussers
of
the
coteries
must
not
pester
him
in
his
golden
preoccupation
with
the
antique
world
tischbein
was
very
useful
in
warding
off
the
profane
throng
fanning
away
the
flies
let
us
hope
he
was
actuated
solely
by
zeal
in
goethe
s
interest
not
by
the
desire
to
swagger
as
a
monopolist
clear
it
is
though
that
he
scented
fine
opportunities
in
goethe
s
relation
to
him
suppose
he
could
rope
his
illustrious
friend
in
as
a
collaborator
he
had
begun
a
series
of
paintings
on
the
theme
of
primaeval
man
goethe
was
much
impressed
by
these
tischbein
suggested
a
great
poem
on
the
theme
of
primaeval
man
a
volume
of
engravings
after
tischbein
with
running
poetic
commentary
by
goethe
indeed
the
frontispiece
for
such
a
joint
work
writes
goethe
in
one
of
his
letters
is
already
pushful
tischbein
but
goethe
though
he
was
the
most
courteous
of
men
was
not
of
the
stuff
of
which
collaborators
are
made
during
our
walks
together
and
can
you
not
see
those
two
together
pacing
up
and
down
the
groves
of
the
villa
pamphili
or
around
the
ruins
of
the
temple
of
jupiter
little
tischbein
gesticulating
and
peering
up
into
goethe
s
face
and
goethe
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
ever
nodding
in
a
manner
he
has
talked
with
me
in
the
hope
of
gaining
me
over
to
his
views
and
getting
me
to
enter
upon
the
goethe
admits
in
another
letter
that
the
idea
is
beautiful
only
he
adds
the
artist
and
the
poet
must
be
many
years
together
in
order
to
carry
out
and
execute
such
a
work
and
one
conceives
that
he
felt
a
certain
lack
of
beauty
in
the
idea
of
being
with
tischbein
for
many
years
did
i
not
fear
to
enter
upon
any
new
tasks
at
present
i
might
perhaps
be
this
i
take
to
be
but
the
repetition
of
a
formula
often
used
in
the
course
of
those
walks
in
no
letter
later
than
november
is
the
scheme
mentioned
tischbein
had
evidently
ceased
to
press
it
anon
he
fell
back
on
a
scheme
less
glorious
but
likelier
to
bear
fruit
latterly
writes
goethe
i
have
observed
tischbein
regarding
me
and
now
note
the
demure
pride
it
appears
that
he
has
long
cherished
the
idea
of
painting
my
earnest
though
he
was
and
hard
at
work
on
various
mss
in
the
intervals
of
it
is
evident
that
to
sit
for
his
portrait
was
a
new
task
which
he
did
not
fear
to
enter
upon
at
nor
need
we
be
surprised
it
seems
to
be
a
law
of
nature
that
no
man
unless
he
has
some
obvious
physical
deformity
ever
is
loth
to
sit
for
his
portrait
a
man
may
be
old
he
may
be
ugly
he
may
be
burdened
with
grave
responsibilities
to
the
nation
and
that
nation
be
at
a
crisis
of
its
history
but
none
of
these
considerations
nor
all
of
them
together
will
deter
him
from
sitting
for
his
portrait
depend
on
him
to
arrive
at
the
studio
punctually
to
surrender
himself
and
sit
as
still
as
a
mouse
trying
to
look
his
best
in
whatever
posture
the
painter
shall
have
selected
as
characteristic
and
talking
if
he
have
leave
to
talk
with
a
touching
humility
and
with
a
keen
sense
of
his
privilege
in
being
allowed
to
pick
up
a
few
ideas
about
art
to
a
dentist
or
a
hairdresser
he
surrenders
himself
without
enthusiasm
even
with
resentment
but
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
studio
there
is
something
that
entrances
him
perhaps
it
is
the
smell
of
turpentine
that
goes
to
his
head
or
more
likely
it
is
the
idea
of
immortality
goethe
was
one
of
the
handsomest
men
of
his
day
and
remember
vain
and
now
in
the
prime
of
life
so
that
he
was
specially
susceptible
to
the
notion
of
being
immortalised
the
design
is
already
settled
and
the
canvas
stretched
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
in
the
original
german
these
words
ring
like
the
opening
of
a
ballad
the
anchor
s
up
and
the
sail
is
spread
as
i
and
you
belike
recited
in
childhood
the
ship
in
that
poem
foundered
if
i
remember
rightly
so
that
the
analogy
to
goethe
s
words
is
all
the
more
striking
it
is
in
this
same
letter
that
the
poet
mentions
those
three
great
points
which
i
have
already
laid
before
you
the
fallen
obelisk
for
him
to
sit
on
the
white
mantle
to
drape
him
and
the
ruined
temples
for
him
to
look
at
it
will
form
a
beautiful
piece
but
he
sadly
calculates
it
will
be
rather
too
big
for
our
northern
courage
there
will
be
plenty
of
room
for
it
in
the
baptistery
of
san
lorenzo
meanwhile
the
work
progressed
a
brief
visit
to
naples
and
sicily
was
part
of
goethe
s
campaign
and
he
was
to
set
forth
from
rome
taking
tischbein
with
him
immediately
after
the
close
of
the
carnival
but
not
a
moment
before
needless
to
say
he
had
no
idea
of
flinging
himself
into
the
carnival
after
the
fashion
of
lesser
and
lighter
tourists
but
the
carnival
was
a
great
phenomenon
to
be
studied
goethe
remember
was
nearly
as
keen
on
science
as
on
art
he
had
ever
been
patient
in
poring
over
plants
botanically
and
fishes
ichthyologically
and
minerals
mineralogically
and
now
day
by
day
he
studied
the
carnival
from
a
strictly
carnivalogical
standpoint
taking
notes
on
which
he
founded
later
a
classic
treatise
his
presence
was
not
needed
in
the
studio
during
these
days
for
the
portrait
begins
already
to
stand
out
from
the
canvas
and
tischbein
was
now
painting
the
folds
of
the
mantle
which
were
swathed
around
a
clay
figure
he
is
working
away
diligently
for
the
work
must
he
says
be
brought
to
a
certain
point
before
we
start
for
besides
the
mantle
tischbein
was
doing
the
campagna
i
remember
that
some
years
ago
an
acquaintance
of
mine
a
painter
who
was
neither
successful
nor
talented
but
always
buoyant
told
me
he
was
starting
for
italy
next
day
i
am
going
he
said
to
paint
the
campagna
the
campagna
wants
tischbein
was
evidently
giving
it
a
good
dose
of
what
it
wanted
it
takes
no
little
time
writes
goethe
to
frau
von
stein
merely
to
cover
so
large
a
field
of
canvas
with
colours

itself

visit
our
ambassador
sir
william
hamilton
that
accomplished
man
vesuvius
is
visited
too
thrice
by
goethe
but
here
for
the
first
time
we
feel
a
vague
uneasiness
only
once
by
tischbein
to
goethe
as
you
may
well
imagine
vesuvius
was
strongly
attractive
at
his
every
ascent
he
was
very
brave
going
as
near
as
possible
to
the
crater
which
he
approached
very
much
as
he
had
approached
the
carnival
not
with
any
wish
to
fling
himself
into
it
but
as
a
resolute
scientific
inquirer
tischbein
on
the
other
hand
merely
disliked
and
feared
vesuvius
he
said
it
had
no
aesthetic
value
and
at
his
one
ascent
did
not
accompany
goethe
to
the
crater
s
edge
he
seems
to
have
regarded
goethe
s
bravery
as
rashness
here
you
see
is
a
rift
ever
so
slight
but
of
evil
omen
what
seismologists
call
a
goethe
was
unconscious
of
its
warning
throughout
his
sojourn
in
naples
he
seems
to
have
thought
that
tischbein
in
naples
was
the
same
as
tischbein
in
rome
of
some
persons
it
is
true
that
change
of
sky
works
no
change
of
soul
oddly
enough
goethe
reckoned
himself
among
the
changeable
in
one
of
his
letters
he
calls
himself
quite
an
altered
man
and
asserts
that
he
is
given
over
to
a
sort
of
intoxicated
a
condition
to
which
his
letters
testify
not
at
all
in
a
later
bulletin
he
is
nearer
the
mark
were
i
not
impelled
by
the
german
spirit
and
desire
to
learn
and
do
rather
than
to
enjoy
i
should
tarry
a
little
longer
in
this
school
of
a
and
happy
life
and
try
to
profit
by
it
still
a
truly
priceless
passage
this
with
a
solemnity
transcending
logic
as
who
should
say
were
i
not
so
thoroughly
german
i
should
be
thoroughly
tischbein
was
of
less
stern
stuff
and
it
is
clear
that
naples
fostered
in
him
a
lightness
which
rome
had
repressed
goethe
says
that
he
himself
puzzled
the
people
in
neapolitan
society
tischbein
pleases
them
far
better
this
evening
he
hastily
painted
some
heads
of
the
size
of
life
and
about
these
they
disported
themselves
as
strangely
as
the
new
zealanders
at
the
sight
of
a
ship
of
one
feels
that
but
for
goethe
s
presence
tischbein
would
have
cut
new
zealand
capers
too
a
week
later
he
did
an
utterly
astounding
thing
he
told
goethe
that
he
would
not
be
accompanying
him
to
sicily
he
did
not
of
course
say
the
novelty
of
your
greatness
has
worn
off
your
solemnity
oppresses
me
be
off
and
leave
me
to
enjoy
myself
in
naples
the
queen
of
watering
places
he
spoke
of
work
which
he
had
undertaken
and
recommended
as
travelling
companion
for
goethe
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
kniep
goethe
we
may
be
sure
was
restrained
by
pride
from
any
show
of
wrath
pride
compelled
him
to
make
light
of
the
matter
in
his
epistles
to
the
weimarians
even
kniep
he
accepted
with
a
good
grace
though
not
without
misgivings
he
needed
a
man
who
would
execute
for
him
sketches
and
paintings
of
all
that
in
the
districts
passed
through
was
worthy
of
record
he
had
already
heard
kniep
highly
spoken
of
as
a
clever
draughtsman
only
his
industry
was
not
much
our
hearts
sink
i
have
tolerably
studied
his
character
and
think
the
ground
of
this
censure
arises
rather
from
a
want
of
decision
which
may
certainly
be
overcome
if
we
are
long
our
hearts
sink
lower
kniep
will
never
do
kniep
will
play
the
deuce
we
are
sure
of
it
and
yet
such
is
life
kniep
turns
out
very
well
throughout
the
sicilian
tour
goethe
gives
the
rosiest
reports
of
the
young
man
s
cheerful
ways
and
strict
attention
to
the
business
of
sketching
it
may
be
that
these
reports
were
coloured
partly
by
a
desire
to
set
tischbein
down
but
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
goethe
liked
kniep
greatly
and
rejoiced
in
the
quantity
and
quality
of
his
work
at
palermo
one
evening
goethe
sat
reading
homer
and
making
an
impromptu
translation
for
the
benefit
of
kniep
who
had
well
deserved
by
his
diligent
exertions
this
day
some
agreeable
refreshment
over
a
glass
of
this
is
a
pleasing
little
scene
and
is
typical
of
the
whole
tour
in
the
middle
of
may
goethe
returned
naples
and
lo
tischbein
was
not
there
to
receive
him
tischbein
if
you
please
had
skipped
back
to
rome
bidding
his
neapolitan
friends
look
to
his
great
compatriot
pride
again
forbade
goethe
to
show
displeasure
and
again
our
reading
has
to
be
done
between
the
lines
in
the
first
week
of
june
he
was
once
more
in
rome
i
can
imagine
with
what
high
courtesy
as
though
there
were
nothing
to
rebuke
he
treated
tischbein
but
it
is
possible
that
his
manner
would
have
been
less
perfect
had
the
portrait
not
been
unfinished
his
sittings
were
resumed
it
seems
that
signora
zucchi
better
known
to
the
world
as
angelica
kauffmann
had
also
begun
to
paint
him
but
great
as
was
goethe
s
esteem
for
the
mind
of
that
nice
woman
he
set
no
store
on
this
fluttering
attempt
of
hers
her
picture
is
a
pretty
fellow
to
be
sure
but
not
a
trace
of
it
was
by
the
large
and
firm
historic
mode
of
tischbein
that
he
not
exactly
in
his
habit
as
he
lived
but
in
the
white
mantle
that
so
well
became
him
and
on
the
worthy
throne
of
that
fallen
obelisk
was
to
be
handed
down
to
the
gaze
of
future
ages
was
to
be
yes
on
june
he
reports
that
tischbein
s
work
is
succeeding
happily
the
likeness
is
striking
and
the
conception
pleases
three
days
later
tischbein
goes
to
incredible
we
stare
aghast
as
in
the
presence
of
some
great
dignitary
from
behind
whom
by
a
ribald
hand
a
chair
is
withdrawn
when
he
is
in
the
act
of
sitting
down
tischbein
had
as
it
were
withdrawn
the
obelisk
what
was
goethe
to
do
what
can
a
dignitary
in
such
case
do
he
can
not
turn
and
recriminate
that
would
but
lower
him
the
more
can
he
behave
as
though
nothing
has
happened
johann
wolfgang
von
goethe
tried
to
do
so
and
it
must
have
been
in
support
of
this
attempt
that
he
consented
to
leave
his
own
quarters
and
reside
awhile
in
the
studio
of
the
outgoing
tischbein
that
slippery
man
does
it
is
true
seem
to
have
given
out
that
he
would
not
be
away
very
long
and
the
prospect
of
his
return
may
well
have
been
reckoned
in
mitigation
of
his
going
goethe
had
leave
from
the
duke
of
weimar
to
prolong
his
italian
holiday
till
the
spring
of
next
year
it
is
possible
that
tischbein
really
did
mean
to
come
back
and
finish
the
picture
goethe
had
at
any
rate
no
reason
for
not
hoping
when
you
think
of
me
think
of
me
as
happy
he
directs
and
had
he
not
indeed
reasons
for
happiness
he
had
the
most
perfect
health
he
was
writing
masterpieces
he
was
in
rome
rome
which
no
pilgrim
had
loved
with
a
rapture
deeper
than
his
the
wonderful
old
rome
that
lingered
on
almost
to
our
own
day
under
the
conserving
shadow
of
the
temporal
power
a
rome
in
which
the
emperors
kept
unquestionably
their
fallen
day
about
them
no
pilgrim
had
wandered
with
a
richer
enthusiasm
along
those
highways
and
those
great
storied
spaces
it
is
pleasing
to
watch
in
what
deep
draughts
goethe
drank
rome
in
but
but
i
fancy
that
now
in
his
second
year
of
sojourn
he
tended
to
remain
within
the
city
walls
caring
less
than
of
yore
for
the
campagna
and
i
suspect
that
if
ever
he
did
stray
out
there
he
averted
his
eyes
from
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
ruined
temple
of
one
thing
i
am
sure
the
huge
canvas
in
the
studio
had
its
face
to
the
wall
there
is
never
a
reference
to
it
by
goethe
in
any
letter
after
that
of
june
but
i
surmise
that
its
nearness
continually
worked
on
him
and
that
sometimes
when
no
one
was
by
he
all
unwillingly
approached
it
he
moved
it
out
into
a
good
light
and
stepping
back
gazed
at
it
for
a
long
time
and
i
wonder
that
tischbein
was
not
shamed
telepathically
to
return
what
was
it
that
had
made
tischbein
not
once
but
thrice
abandon
goethe
we
have
no
right
to
suppose
he
had
plotted
to
avenge
himself
for
the
poet
s
refusal
to
collaborate
with
him
on
the
theme
of
primaeval
man
a
likelier
explanation
is
merely
that
goethe
as
i
have
suggested
irked
him
forty
years
elapsed
before
goethe
collected
his
letters
from
italy
and
made
a
book
of
them
and
in
this
book
he
included
how
magnanimous
old
men
are
several
letters
written
to
him
from
naples
by
his
deserter
these
are
shallow
but
vivid
documents
the
effusions
of
one
for
whom
the
visible
world
suffices
i
take
it
that
tischbein
was
an
historic
painter
because
no
ambitious
painter
in
those
days
wasn
t
in
goethe
the
historic
sense
was
as
innate
as
the
aesthetic
so
was
the
ethical
sense
so
was
the
scientific
sense
and
the
three
of
them
forever
cropping
up
in
his
discourse
may
well
be
understood
to
have
been
too
much
for
the
simple
tischbein
but
you
ask
can
mere
boredom
make
a
man
act
so
cruelly
as
this
man
acted
well
there
may
have
been
another
cause
and
a
more
interesting
one
i
have
mentioned
that
goethe
and
tischbein
visited
our
ambassador
in
naples
his
excellency
was
at
that
time
a
widower
but
his
establishment
was
already
graced
by
his
future
wife
miss
emma
harte
whose
beauty
is
so
well
known
to
us
all
tischbein
wrote
goethe
a
few
days
afterwards
is
engaged
in
painting
later
in
the
year
tischbein
soon
after
his
return
to
naples
sent
to
goethe
a
sketch
for
a
painting
he
had
now
done
of
miss
harte
as
iphigenia
at
the
sacrificial
altar
perhaps
he
had
wondered
that
she
should
sacrifice
herself
to
sir
william
hamilton
i
like
hamilton
uncommonly
is
a
phrase
culled
from
one
of
his
letters
and
when
a
man
is
very
hearty
about
the
protector
of
a
very
beautiful
woman
one
begins
to
be
suspicious
i
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
miss
harte
though
it
is
true
she
had
not
yet
met
nelson
was
fascinated
by
tischbein
but
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
tischbein
was
less
susceptible
than
romney
altogether
it
seems
likely
enough
that
the
future
lady
hamilton
s
fine
eyes
were
tischbein
s
main
reason
for
not
going
to
sicily
and
afterwards
for
his
sudden
exodus
from
rome
but
why
in
this
case
did
he
leave
naples
why
go
back
to
rome
when
goethe
was
in
sicily
i
hope
he
went
for
the
purpose
of
shaking
off
his
infatuation
for
miss
harte
i
am
loth
to
think
he
went
merely
to
wind
up
his
affairs
in
rome
i
will
assume
that
only
after
a
sharp
conflict
in
which
he
fought
hard
on
the
side
of
duty
against
love
did
he
relapse
to
naples
but
i
won
t
pretend
to
wish
he
had
finished
that
portrait
if
you
know
where
that
portrait
is
tell
me
i
want
it
i
have
tried
to
trace
it
vainly
what
became
of
it
i
thought
i
might
find
this
out
in
george
henry
lewes
life
of
but
lewes
had
a
for
goethe
he
thought
him
greater
than
george
eliot
and
in
the
whole
book
there
is
but
one
cold
mention
of
tischbein
s
name
oscar
browning
in
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
names
tischbein
as
goethe
s
constant
companion
in
the
early
days
at
rome
and
says
nothing
else
about
him
in
fact
the
have
evidently
conspired
to
hush
up
the
affront
to
their
hero
even
the
penny
cyclopaedia
which
devotes
a
column
to
little
tischbein
himself
and
goes
into
various
details
of
his
career
is
silent
about
the
portrait
of
goethe
i
learn
from
that
column
that
tischbein
became
director
of
the
neapolitan
academy
at
a
salary
of
ducats
and
resided
in
naples
until
the
revolution
of
when
he
returned
in
haste
to
germany
suppose
he
passed
through
rome
on
his
way
a
homing
fugitive
would
not
pause
to
burden
himself
with
a
vast
unfinished
canvas
we
may
be
sure
the
canvas
remained
in
that
roman
studio
an
object
of
mild
interest
to
successive
occupants
is
it
there
still
does
the
studio
itself
still
exist
belike
it
has
been
demolished
with
so
much
else
what
became
of
the
expropriated
canvas
it
wouldn
t
have
been
buried
in
the
new
foundations
some
one
must
have
staggered
away
with
it
whither
somewhere
i
am
sure
in
some
dark
vault
or
cellar
it
languishes
seek
it
fetch
it
out
bring
it
to
me
in
triumph
you
will
always
find
me
in
the
baptistery
of
san
lorenzo
but
i
have
formed
so
clear
and
sharp
a
preconception
of
the
portrait
that
i
am
likely
to
be
disappointed
at
sight
of
what
you
bring
me
i
see
in
my
mind
s
eye
every
falling
fold
of
the
white
mantle
the
calf
of
the
leg
on
which
rests
the
forearm
the
on
the
black
silk
stocking
the
shoes
the
hands
are
rather
sketchy
the
sky
is
a
mere
slab
the
ruined
temples
are
no
more
than
adumbrated
but
the
expression
of
the
face
is
perfectly
epitomically
that
of
a
great
man
surveying
a
great
alien
scene
and
gauging
its
import
not
without
a
keen
sense
of
its
dramatic
conjunction
with
himself
marius
in
carthage
and
napoleon
before
the
sphinx
wordsworth
on
london
bridge
and
cortes
on
the
peak
in
darien
but
most
of
all
certainly
goethe
in
the
campagna
so
you
see
i
can
not
promise
not
to
be
horribly
let
down
by
tischbein
s
actual
handiwork
i
may
even
have
to
take
back
my
promise
that
it
shall
have
a
place
of
honour
but
i
shall
not
utterly
reject
it
unless
on
the
plea
that
a
collection
of
unfinished
works
should
itself
have
some
great
touch
of
incompletion
something
defeasible
july
the
cottage
had
a
good
trim
garden
in
front
of
it
and
another
behind
it
i
might
not
have
noticed
it
at
all
but
for
them
and
their
emerald
greenness
yet
itself
i
saw
when
i
studied
it
was
worthy
of
them
sussex
is
rich
in
fine
jacobean
cottages
and
their
example
clearly
had
not
been
lost
on
the
builder
of
this
one
its
proportions
had
a
homely
grandeur
it
was
long
and
wide
and
low
it
was
quite
a
yard
long
it
had
three
admirable
gables
it
had
a
substantial
and
shapely
i
liked
the
look
that
it
had
of
honest
solidity
all
over
nothing
anywhere
scamped
in
the
workmanship
of
it
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
built
for
all
time
but
this
was
not
so
for
it
was
built
on
sand
and
of
sand
and
the
tide
was
coming
in
here
and
there
in
its
vicinity
stood
other
buildings
none
of
these
possessed
any
points
of
interest
they
were
just
castles
of
the
bald
and
hasty
kind
which
i
myself
used
to
make
in
childhood
and
could
make
even
now
conic
affairs
with
or
without
moats
the
nullities
of
convention
and
of
unskilled
labour
when
i
was
a
child
the
charm
of
a
castle
was
not
in
the
building
of
it
but
in
jumping
over
it
when
it
was
built
nor
was
this
an
enduring
charm
after
a
few
jumps
one
abandoned
one
s
castle
and
asked
one
s
nurse
for
a
bun
or
picked
a
quarrel
with
some
child
even
smaller
than
oneself
or
went
paddling
as
it
was
so
it
is
my
survey
of
the
sands
this
morning
showed
me
that
forty
years
had
made
no
difference
here
was
plenty
of
animation
plenty
of
scurrying
and
gambolling
of
laughter
and
tears
but
the
actual
spadework
was
a
mere
empty
form
for
all
but
the
builder
of
that
cottage
for
him
manifestly
a
passion
a
rite
he
stood
spade
in
hand
contemplating
from
one
angle
and
another
what
he
had
done
he
was
perhaps
nine
years
old
if
so
small
for
his
age
he
had
very
thin
legs
in
very
short
grey
knickerbockers
a
pale
freckled
face
and
hair
that
matched
the
sand
he
was
not
remarkable
but
with
a
little
one
can
always
find
something
impressive
in
anybody
when
won
a
wide
and
very
sudden
fame
in
connexion
with
covent
garden
an
reporter
wrote
of
him
for
the
daily
mail
he
has
the
eyes
of
a
i
believe
that
cecil
rhodes
really
had
so
it
seemed
to
me
had
this
little
boy
they
were
pale
grey
eyes
rather
prominent
with
an
unwavering
light
in
them
i
guessed
that
they
were
regarding
the
cottage
rather
as
what
it
should
be
than
as
what
it
had
become
to
me
it
appeared
quite
perfect
but
i
surmised
that
to
him
artist
that
he
was
it
seemed
a
poor
thing
beside
his
first
flushed
conception
he
knelt
down
and
partly
with
the
flat
of
his
spade
partly
with
the
palm
of
one
hand
redressed
some
to
me
obscure
fault
in
one
of
the
gables
he
rose
stood
back
his
eyes
slowly
endorsed
the
amendment
a
few
moments
later
very
suddenly
he
scudded
away
to
the
adjacent
breakwater
and
gave
himself
to
the
task
of
scraping
off
it
some
of
the
short
green
wherewith
he
had
made
the
cottage
s
two
gardens
so
pleasantly
realistic
oases
so
refreshing
in
the
sandy
desert
were
the
lawns
somehow
imperfect
anon
when
he
darted
back
i
saw
what
it
was
that
his
taste
had
required
lichen
moss
for
the
roof
sundry
morsels
and
patches
of
green
he
deftly
disposed
in
the
angles
of
roof
and
gables
his
stock
exhausted
off
to
the
breakwater
he
darted
and
back
again
to
and
fro
with
the
lightning
directness
of
a
making
its
nest
of
pollen
the
low
walls
that
enclosed
the
two
gardens
were
in
need
of
creepers
little
by
little
this
grace
was
added
to
them
i
stood
silently
watching
i
kept
silent
for
fear
of
discommoding
him
all
artists
by
which
i
mean
of
course
all
good
artists
are
shy
they
are
trustees
of
something
not
entrusted
to
us
others
they
bear
fragile
treasure
not
safe
in
a
jostling
crowd
they
must
ever
be
wary
and
especially
shy
are
those
artists
whose
work
is
apart
from
words
a
man
of
letters
can
mitigate
his
embarrassment
among
us
by
a
certain
glibness
not
so
can
the
man
who
works
through
the
medium
of
visual
form
and
colour
not
so
i
was
sure
could
the
young
architect
and
here
creating
i
would
have
moved
away
had
i
thought
my
mere
presence
was
a
bother
to
him
but
i
decided
that
it
was
not
being
a
person
i
did
not
matter
he
had
no
fear
that
i
should
offer
violence
to
his
work
it
was
his
coevals
that
made
him
uneasy
groups
of
these
would
pause
in
their
wild
career
to
stand
over
him
and
watch
him
in
a
fidgety
manner
that
hinted
mischief
suppose
one
of
them
suddenly
jumped
on
to
the
cottage
fragile
treasure
this
in
a
quite
literal
sense
and
how
awfully
exposed
it
was
spared
however
there
was
even
legible
on
the
faces
of
the
stolid
little
boys
who
viewed
it
a
sort
of
reluctant
approval
some
of
the
little
girls
seemed
to
be
forming
with
their
lips
the
word
pretty
but
then
they
exchanged
glances
with
one
another
signifying
no
one
of
either
sex
uttered
any
word
of
praise
and
so
because
artists
be
they
never
so
agoraphobious
do
want
praise
i
did
at
length
break
my
silence
to
this
one
i
think
it
splendid
i
said
to
him
he
looked
up
at
me
and
down
at
the
cottage
do
you
he
asked
looking
up
again
i
assured
him
that
i
did
and
to
test
my
opinion
of
him
i
asked
whether
he
didn
t
think
so
too
he
stood
the
test
well
i
wanted
it
rather
diff
rent
he
answered
in
what
way
different
he
searched
his
vocabulary
more
comf
table
he
found
i
knew
now
that
he
was
not
merely
the
architect
and
builder
of
the
cottage
but
also
by
courtesy
of
imagination
its
tenant
but
i
was
tactful
enough
not
to
let
him
see
that
i
had
guessed
this
deep
and
delicate
secret
i
did
but
ask
him
in
a
quite
general
way
how
the
cottage
could
be
better
he
said
that
it
ought
to
have
a
porch
but
porches
tumble
he
was
too
young
an
artist
to
accept
quite
meekly
the
limits
imposed
by
his
material
he
pointed
along
the
lower
edge
of
the
roof
it
ought
to
stick
out
he
said
meaning
that
it
wanted
eaves
i
told
him
not
to
worry
about
that
it
was
the
sand
s
fault
not
his
what
really
is
a
pity
i
said
is
that
your
house
can
t
last
for
he
was
tracing
now
on
the
roof
with
the
edge
of
his
spade
a
pattern
to
represent
tiles
and
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
my
presence
and
my
kindness
aren
t
you
sorry
i
asked
raising
my
voice
rather
sharply
that
the
sea
is
coming
in
he
glanced
at
the
sea
he
said
this
with
a
lack
of
emphasis
that
seemed
to
me
noble
though
insincere
the
strain
of
talking
in
words
of
not
more
than
three
syllables
had
begun
to
tell
on
me
i
bade
the
artist
wandered
away
up
the
steps
to
the
parade
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
opened
the
morning
paper
that
i
had
brought
out
unread
during
the
war
one
felt
it
a
duty
to
know
the
worst
before
breakfast
now
that
the
english
polity
is
threatened
merely
from
within
one
is
apt
to
dally
merely
from
within
is
that
a
right
phrase
when
the
nerves
of
unrestful
labour
in
any
one
land
are
interplicated
with
its
nerves
in
any
other
so
vibrantly
news
of
the
dismissal
of
an
erring
workman
in
timbuctoo
is
enough
nowadays
to
make
us
apprehensive
of
vast
and
dreadful
effects
on
our
own
immediate
future
how
pleasant
if
we
had
lived
our
lives
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
no
other
with
the
ground
all
firm
under
our
feet
true
the
people
who
flourished
then
had
recurring
alarms
but
their
alarms
were
quite
needless
whereas
ours
ours
as
i
glanced
at
this
morning
s
news
from
timbuctoo
and
elsewhere
seemed
odiously
needful
withal
our
old
nobility
in
its
pleasaunces
was
treading
once
more
the
old
graceful
measure
which
the
war
arrested
bohemia
had
resumed
its
motley
even
the
middle
class
was
capering
very
noticeably
to
gad
about
smiling
as
though
he
were
quite
well
thank
you
or
to
sit
down
pull
a
long
face
and
make
his
soul
which
i
wondered
is
the
better
procedure
for
a
man
knowing
that
very
soon
he
will
have
to
undergo
a
vital
operation
at
the
hands
of
a
wholly
unqualified
surgeon
who
dislikes
him
personally
i
inclined
to
think
the
gloomier
way
the
less
ghastly
but
then
i
asked
myself
was
my
analogy
a
sound
one
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
labour
certainly
and
labour
does
not
love
us
and
labour
is
not
deeply
versed
in
statecraft
but
would
an
unskilled
surgeon
however
care
to
perform
a
drastic
operation
on
a
patient
by
whose
death
he
himself
would
forthwith
perish
labour
is
wise
enough
surely
not
to
will
us
destruction
russia
has
been
an
awful
example
surely
and
yet
labour
does
not
seem
to
think
the
example
so
awful
as
i
do
queer
this
queer
and
disquieting
i
rose
from
my
bench
strolled
to
the
railing
and
gazed
forth
the
unrestful
the
and
minatory
sea
had
been
advancing
quickly
it
was
not
very
far
now
from
the
cottage
i
thought
of
all
the
civilisations
that
had
been
that
were
not
that
were
as
though
they
had
never
been
must
it
always
be
thus
always
the
same
old
tale
of
growth
and
greatness
and
overthrow
nothingness
i
gazed
at
the
cottage
all
so
solid
and
seemly
so
full
of
endearing
character
so
like
to
the
comf
table
polity
of
england
as
we
have
known
it
i
gazed
away
from
it
to
a
castle
that
the
sea
was
just
reaching
a
little
then
quickly
much
the
waters
swirled
into
the
moat
many
children
stood
by
all
with
excitement
the
castle
was
shedding
its
sides
lapsing
dwindling
landslipping
gone
o
nineveh
and
now
another
o
memphis
rome
yielded
to
the
cataclysm
i
listened
to
the
jubilant
screams
of
the
children
what
rapture
what
wantoning
motionless
beside
his
work
stood
the
builder
of
the
cottage
gazing
seaward
a
pathetic
little
figure
i
hoped
the
other
children
would
have
the
decency
not
to
exult
over
the
unmaking
of
what
he
had
made
so
well
this
hope
was
not
fulfilled
i
had
not
supposed
it
would
be
what
did
surprise
me
when
anon
the
sea
rolled
close
up
to
the
cottage
was
the
comportment
of
the
young
artist
himself
his
sobriety
gave
place
to
an
intense
animation
he
leapt
he
waved
his
spade
he
invited
the
waves
with
wild
gestures
and
gleeful
cries
his
face
had
flushed
bright
and
now
as
the
garden
walls
crumbled
and
the
paths
and
lawns
were
mingled
by
the
waters
influence
and
confluence
and
the
walls
of
the
cottage
itself
began
to
totter
and
the
gables
sank
and
all
all
was
swallowed
his
leaps
were
so
high
in
air
that
they
recalled
to
my
memory
those
of
a
strange
religious
sect
which
once
visited
london
and
the
glare
of
his
eyes
was
less
indicative
of
a
dreamer
than
of
a
triumphant
fiend
i
myself
was
conscious
of
a
certain
wild
enthusiasm
within
me
but
this
was
less
surprising
for
that
i
had
not
built
the
cottage
and
my
fancy
had
not
enabled
me
to
dwell
in
it
it
was
the
boy
s
own
enthusiasm
that
made
me
feel
as
never
before
how
in
the
human
breast
the
love
of
destruction
of
mere
destruction
is
and
i
began
to
ask
myself
even
if
england
as
we
know
it
the
english
polity
of
which
that
cottage
was
a
symbol
to
me
were
the
work
of
say
robert
smillie
s
own
unaided
hands
but
i
waived
the
question
coming
from
that
hypothesis
and
other
questions
that
would
have
followed
for
i
wished
to
be
happy
while
i
might
a
clergyman
fragmentary
pale
momentary
almost
nothing
glimpsed
and
gone
as
it
were
a
faint
human
hand
thrust
up
never
to
reappear
from
beneath
the
rolling
waters
of
time
he
forever
haunts
my
memory
and
solicits
my
weak
imagination
nothing
is
told
of
him
but
that
once
abruptly
he
asked
a
question
and
received
an
answer
this
was
on
the
afternoon
of
april
at
streatham
in
the
house
of
thrale
johnson
on
the
morning
of
that
day
had
entertained
boswell
at
breakfast
in
bolt
court
and
invited
him
to
dine
at
thrale
hall
the
two
took
coach
and
arrived
early
it
seems
that
sir
john
pringle
had
asked
boswell
to
ask
johnson
what
were
the
best
english
sermons
for
in
the
interval
before
dinner
accordingly
boswell
reeled
off
the
names
of
several
divines
whose
prose
might
or
might
not
win
commendation
atterbury
he
suggested
johnson
yes
sir
one
of
the
best
boswell
tillotson
johnson
why
not
now
i
should
not
advise
any
one
to
imitate
tillotson
s
style
though
i
don
t
know
i
should
be
cautious
of
censuring
anything
that
has
been
applauded
by
so
many
south
is
one
of
the
best
if
you
except
his
peculiarities
and
his
violence
and
sometimes
coarseness
of
seed
has
a
very
fine
style
but
he
is
not
very
theological
jortin
s
sermons
are
very
elegant
sherlock
s
style
too
is
very
elegant
though
he
has
not
made
it
his
principal
and
you
may
add
smalridge
boswell
i
like
ogden
s
sermons
on
prayer
very
much
both
for
neatness
of
style
and
subtility
of
reasoning
johnson
i
should
like
to
read
all
that
ogden
has
written
boswell
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
sermons
afford
the
best
specimen
of
english
pulpit
eloquence
johnson
we
have
no
sermons
addressed
to
the
passions
that
are
good
for
anything
if
you
mean
that
kind
of
eloquence
a
clergyman
whose
name
i
do
not
recollect
were
not
dodd
s
sermons
addressed
to
the
passions
johnson
they
were
nothing
sir
be
they
addressed
to
what
they
the
suddenness
of
it
bang
and
the
rabbit
that
had
popped
from
its
burrow
was
no
more
i
know
not
which
is
the
more
startling
the
de
but
of
the
unfortunate
clergyman
or
the
instantaneousness
of
his
end
why
hadn
t
boswell
told
us
there
was
a
clergyman
present
well
we
may
be
sure
that
so
careful
and
acute
an
artist
had
some
good
reason
and
i
suppose
the
clergyman
was
left
to
take
us
unawares
because
just
so
did
he
take
the
company
had
we
been
told
he
was
there
we
might
have
expected
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
join
in
the
conversation
he
would
have
had
a
place
in
our
minds
we
may
assume
that
in
the
minds
of
the
company
around
johnson
he
had
no
place
he
sat
forgotten
overlooked
so
that
his
startled
every
one
just
as
on
boswell
s
page
it
startles
us
in
johnson
s
massive
and
magnetic
presence
only
some
very
remarkable
man
such
as
burke
was
sharply
distinguishable
from
the
rest
others
might
if
they
had
something
in
them
stand
out
slightly
this
unfortunate
clergyman
may
have
had
something
in
him
but
i
judge
that
he
lacked
the
gift
of
seeming
as
if
he
had
that
deficiency
however
does
not
account
for
the
horrid
fate
that
befell
him
one
of
johnson
s
strongest
and
most
inveterate
feelings
was
his
veneration
for
the
cloth
to
any
one
in
holy
orders
he
habitually
listened
with
a
grave
and
charming
deference
moreover
he
was
in
excellent
good
humour
he
was
at
the
thrales
where
he
so
loved
to
be
the
day
was
fine
a
fine
dinner
was
in
close
prospect
and
he
had
had
what
he
always
declared
to
be
the
sum
of
human
felicity
a
ride
in
a
coach
nor
was
there
in
the
question
put
by
the
clergyman
anything
likely
to
enrage
him
dodd
was
one
whom
johnson
had
befriended
in
adversity
and
it
had
always
been
agreed
that
dodd
in
his
pulpit
was
very
emotional
what
drew
the
blasting
flash
must
have
been
not
the
question
itself
but
the
manner
in
which
it
was
asked
and
i
think
we
can
guess
what
that
manner
was
say
the
words
aloud
were
not
dodd
s
sermons
addressed
to
the
passions
they
are
words
which
if
you
have
any
dramatic
and
histrionic
sense
can
not
be
said
except
in
a
high
thin
voice
you
may
from
sheer
perversity
utter
them
in
a
rich
and
sonorous
baritone
or
bass
but
if
you
do
so
they
sound
utterly
unnatural
to
make
them
carry
the
conviction
of
human
utterance
you
have
no
choice
you
must
pipe
them
remember
now
johnson
was
very
deaf
even
the
people
whom
he
knew
well
the
people
to
whose
voices
he
was
accustomed
had
to
address
him
very
loudly
it
is
probable
that
this
unregarded
young
shy
clergyman
when
at
length
he
suddenly
mustered
courage
to
cut
in
let
his
high
thin
voice
soar
too
high
insomuch
that
it
was
a
kind
of
scream
on
no
other
hypothesis
can
we
account
for
the
ferocity
with
which
johnson
turned
and
rended
him
johnson
didn
t
we
may
be
sure
mean
to
be
cruel
the
old
lion
startled
just
struck
out
blindly
but
the
force
of
paw
and
claws
was
not
the
less
lethal
we
have
endless
testimony
to
the
strength
of
johnson
s
voice
and
the
very
cadence
of
those
words
they
were
nothing
sir
be
they
addressed
to
what
they
may
convinces
me
that
the
old
lion
s
jaws
never
gave
forth
a
louder
roar
boswell
does
not
record
that
there
was
any
further
conversation
before
the
announcement
of
dinner
perhaps
the
whole
company
had
been
temporarily
deafened
but
i
am
not
bothering
about
them
my
heart
goes
out
to
the
poor
dear
clergyman
exclusively
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
he
was
young
and
shy
and
i
admit
that
i
slipped
those
epithets
in
without
having
justified
them
to
you
by
due
process
of
induction
your
quick
mind
will
have
already
supplied
what
i
omitted
a
man
with
a
high
thin
voice
and
without
power
to
impress
any
one
with
a
sense
of
his
importance
a
man
so
null
in
effect
that
even
the
retentive
mind
of
boswell
did
not
retain
his
very
name
would
assuredly
not
be
a
man
even
if
he
were
not
naturally
shy
social
courage
would
soon
have
been
sapped
in
him
and
would
in
time
have
been
destroyed
by
experience
that
he
had
not
yet
given
himself
up
as
a
bad
job
that
he
still
had
faint
wild
hopes
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
he
did
snatch
the
opportunity
for
asking
that
question
he
must
accordingly
have
been
young
was
he
the
curate
of
the
neighbouring
church
i
think
so
it
would
account
for
his
having
been
invited
i
see
him
as
he
sits
there
listening
to
the
great
doctor
s
pronouncement
on
atterbury
and
those
others
he
sits
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
in
the
background
he
has
colourless
eyes
fixed
earnestly
and
a
face
almost
as
pale
as
the
clerical
bands
beneath
his
somewhat
receding
chin
his
forehead
is
high
and
narrow
his
hair
his
hands
are
clasped
tight
before
him
the
knuckles
standing
out
sharply
this
constriction
does
not
mean
that
he
is
steeling
himself
to
speak
he
has
no
positive
intention
of
speaking
very
much
nevertheless
is
he
wishing
in
the
back
of
his
mind
that
he
could
say
something
something
whereat
the
great
doctor
would
turn
on
him
and
say
after
a
pause
for
thought
why
yes
sir
that
is
most
justly
observed
or
sir
this
has
never
occurred
to
me
i
thank
you
thereby
fixing
the
observer
for
ever
high
in
the
esteem
of
all
and
now
in
a
flash
the
chance
presents
itself
we
have
shouts
johnson
no
sermons
addressed
to
the
passions
that
are
good
for
i
see
the
curate
s
frame
quiver
with
sudden
impulse
and
his
mouth
fly
open
and
no
i
can
t
bear
it
i
shut
my
eyes
and
ears
but
audible
even
so
is
something
shrill
followed
by
something
thunderous
presently
i
my
eyes
the
crimson
has
not
yet
faded
from
that
young
face
yonder
and
slowly
down
either
cheek
falls
a
glistening
tear
shades
of
atterbury
and
tillotson
such
weakness
shames
the
established
church
what
would
jortin
and
smalridge
have
said
what
seed
and
south
and
by
the
way
who
were
they
these
worthies
it
is
a
solemn
thought
that
so
little
is
conveyed
to
us
by
names
which
to
the
conveyed
so
much
we
discern
a
dim
composite
picture
of
a
big
man
in
a
big
wig
and
a
billowing
black
gown
with
a
big
congregation
beneath
him
but
we
are
not
anxious
to
hear
what
he
is
saying
we
know
it
is
all
very
elegant
we
know
it
will
be
printed
and
be
bound
in
full
calf
and
no
gentleman
s
library
will
be
complete
without
it
literate
people
in
those
days
were
comparatively
few
but
bating
that
one
may
say
that
sermons
were
as
much
in
request
as
novels
are
i
wonder
will
mankind
continue
to
be
capricious
it
is
a
very
solemn
thought
indeed
that
no
more
than
a
years
hence
the
novelists
of
our
time
with
all
their
moral
and
political
and
sociological
outlook
and
influence
will
perhaps
shine
as
indistinctly
as
do
those
old
preachers
with
all
their
elegance
now
yes
sir
some
great
pundit
may
be
telling
a
disciple
at
this
moment
wells
is
one
of
the
best
galsworthy
is
one
of
the
best
if
you
except
his
concern
for
delicacy
of
style
ward
has
a
very
firm
grasp
of
problems
but
is
not
very
caine
s
books
are
very
edifying
i
should
like
to
read
all
that
caine
has
written
miss
corelli
too
is
very
and
you
may
add
upton
what
i
want
to
know
says
the
disciple
is
what
english
novels
may
be
selected
as
specially
the
pundit
answers
we
have
no
novels
addressed
to
the
passions
that
are
good
for
anything
if
you
mean
that
kind
of
and
here
some
poor
wretch
whose
name
the
disciple
will
not
remember
inquires
are
not
glyn
s
novels
addressed
to
the
passions
and
is
in
due
form
annihilated
can
it
be
that
a
time
will
come
when
readers
of
this
passage
in
our
pundit
s
life
will
take
more
interest
in
the
poor
nameless
wretch
than
in
all
the
bearers
of
those
great
names
put
together
being
no
more
able
or
anxious
to
discriminate
between
say
ward
and
sinclair
than
we
are
to
set
ogden
above
sherlock
or
sherlock
above
ogden
it
seems
impossible
but
we
must
remember
that
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
every
man
illustrious
in
his
day
however
much
he
may
be
gratified
by
his
fame
looks
with
an
eager
eye
to
posterity
for
a
continuance
of
past
favours
and
would
even
live
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
obscurity
if
by
so
doing
he
could
insure
that
future
generations
would
preserve
a
correct
attitude
towards
him
forever
this
is
very
natural
and
human
but
like
so
many
very
natural
and
human
things
very
silly
tillotson
and
the
rest
need
not
after
all
be
pitied
for
our
neglect
of
them
they
either
know
nothing
about
it
or
are
above
such
terrene
trifles
let
us
keep
our
pity
for
the
seething
mass
of
divines
who
were
not
elegantly
verbose
and
had
no
fun
or
glory
while
they
lasted
and
let
us
keep
a
specially
large
portion
for
one
whose
lot
was
so
much
worse
than
merely
undistinguished
if
that
nameless
curate
had
not
been
at
the
thrales
that
day
or
being
there
had
kept
the
silence
that
so
well
became
him
his
life
would
have
been
drab
enough
in
all
conscience
but
at
any
rate
an
unpromising
career
would
not
have
been
nipped
in
the
bud
and
that
is
what
in
fact
happened
i
m
sure
of
it
a
robust
man
might
have
rallied
under
the
blow
not
so
our
friend
those
who
knew
him
in
infancy
had
not
expected
that
he
would
be
reared
better
for
him
had
they
been
right
it
is
well
to
grow
up
and
be
ordained
but
not
if
you
are
delicate
and
very
sensitive
and
shall
happen
to
annoy
the
greatest
the
most
stentorian
and
roughest
of
contemporary
personages
a
clergyman
never
held
up
his
head
or
smiled
again
after
the
brief
encounter
recorded
for
us
by
boswell
he
sank
into
a
rapid
decline
before
the
next
blossoming
of
thrale
hall
s
almond
trees
he
was
no
more
i
like
to
think
that
he
died
forgiving
johnson
the
crime
on
a
bleak
wet
stormy
afternoon
at
the
outset
of
last
year
s
spring
i
was
in
a
cottage
all
alone
and
knowing
that
i
must
be
all
alone
till
evening
it
was
a
remote
cottage
in
a
remote
county
and
had
been
let
furnished
by
its
owner
my
spirits
are
easily
affected
by
weather
and
i
hate
solitude
and
i
dislike
to
be
master
of
things
that
are
not
mine
be
careful
not
to
break
us
say
the
glass
and
china
you
d
better
not
spill
ink
on
me
growls
the
carpet
none
of
your
dog
tricks
here
snarl
the
books
the
books
in
this
cottage
looked
particularly
disagreeable
horrid
little
upstarts
of
this
and
that
scarlet
or
cerulean
series
of
standard
authors
having
gloomily
surveyed
them
i
turned
my
back
on
them
and
watched
the
rain
streaming
down
the
latticed
window
whose
panes
seemed
likely
to
be
shattered
at
any
moment
by
the
wind
i
have
known
men
who
constantly
visit
the
central
criminal
court
visit
also
the
scenes
where
famous
crimes
were
committed
form
their
own
theories
of
those
crimes
collect
souvenirs
of
those
crimes
and
call
themselves
criminologists
as
for
me
my
interest
in
crime
is
alas
merely
morbid
i
did
not
know
as
those
others
would
doubtless
have
known
that
the
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
was
precisely
of
the
kind
most
conducive
to
the
darkest
deeds
i
did
but
bemoan
it
and
think
of
lear
in
the
hovel
on
the
heath
the
wind
howled
in
the
chimney
and
the
rain
had
begun
to
sputter
right
down
it
so
that
the
fire
was
beginning
to
hiss
in
a
very
sinister
manner
suppose
the
fire
went
out
it
looked
as
if
it
meant
to
i
snatched
the
pair
of
bellows
that
hung
beside
it
i
plied
them
vigorously
now
mind
not
too
vigorously
we
aren
t
yours
they
wheezed
i
handled
them
more
gently
but
i
did
not
release
them
till
they
had
secured
me
a
steady
blaze
i
sat
down
before
that
blaze
despair
had
been
warded
off
gloom
however
remained
and
gloom
grew
i
felt
that
i
should
prefer
any
one
s
thoughts
to
mine
i
rose
i
returned
to
the
books
a
dozen
or
so
of
those
which
were
on
the
lowest
of
the
three
shelves
were
were
octavo
looked
as
though
they
had
been
bought
to
be
read
i
would
exercise
my
undoubted
right
to
read
one
of
them
which
of
them
i
gradually
decided
on
a
novel
by
a
writer
whose
works
though
i
had
several
times
had
the
honour
of
meeting
her
were
known
to
me
only
by
repute
i
knew
nothing
of
them
that
was
not
good
the
lady
s
output
had
not
been
at
all
huge
and
it
was
agreed
that
her
level
was
high
i
had
always
gathered
that
the
chief
characteristic
of
her
work
was
its
great
the
book
in
my
hand
was
a
third
edition
of
her
latest
novel
and
at
the
end
of
it
were
numerous
at
which
i
glanced
for
confirmation
immense
vitality
yes
said
one
critic
full
said
another
of
an
intense
a
book
that
will
live
said
a
third
how
on
earth
did
he
know
that
i
was
however
very
willing
to
believe
in
the
vitality
of
this
writer
for
all
present
purposes
vitality
was
a
thing
in
which
she
herself
her
talk
her
glance
her
gestures
abounded
she
and
they
had
been
i
remembered
rather
too
much
for
me
the
first
time
i
met
her
she
said
something
that
i
lightly
and
mildly
disputed
on
no
future
occasion
did
i
stem
any
opinion
of
hers
not
that
she
had
been
rude
far
from
it
she
had
but
in
a
sisterly
brotherly
way
and
yet
in
a
way
that
was
filially
eager
too
asked
me
to
explain
my
point
i
did
my
best
she
was
all
attention
but
i
was
conscious
that
my
best
under
her
eye
was
not
good
she
was
quick
to
help
me
she
said
for
me
just
what
i
had
tried
to
say
and
proceeded
to
show
me
just
why
it
was
wrong
i
smiled
the
gallant
smile
of
a
man
who
regards
women
as
all
the
more
adorable
because
logic
is
not
their
strong
point
bless
them
she
asked
not
aggressively
but
strenuously
as
one
who
dearly
loves
a
joke
what
i
was
smiling
at
altogether
a
chastening
encounter
and
my
memory
of
it
was
tinged
with
a
feeble
resentment
how
she
had
scored
no
man
likes
to
be
worsted
in
argument
by
a
woman
and
i
fancy
that
to
be
vanquished
by
a
feminine
writer
is
the
kind
of
defeat
least
of
all
agreeable
to
a
man
who
writes
a
sex
war
we
are
often
told
is
to
be
one
of
the
features
of
the
world
s
future
women
demanding
the
right
to
do
men
s
work
and
men
refusing
resisting
it
seems
likely
enough
one
can
believe
anything
of
the
world
s
future
yet
one
conceives
that
not
all
men
if
this
particular
evil
come
to
pass
will
stand
packed
shoulder
to
shoulder
against
all
women
one
does
not
feel
that
the
dockers
will
be
very
bitter
against
such
women
as
want
to
be
miners
or
the
plumbers
frown
much
upon
the
i
myself
have
never
had
my
sense
of
fitness
jarred
nor
a
spark
of
animosity
roused
in
me
by
a
woman
practising
any
of
the
fine
arts
except
the
art
of
writing
that
she
should
write
a
few
little
poems
or
pensées
or
some
impressions
of
a
trip
in
a
dahabieh
as
far
as
say
biskra
or
even
a
short
story
or
two
seems
to
me
not
wholly
amiss
even
though
she
do
such
things
for
publication
but
that
she
should
be
an
habitual
professional
author
with
a
passion
for
her
art
and
a
and
an
agent
and
sums
down
in
advance
of
royalties
on
sales
in
canada
and
australia
and
a
profound
knowledge
of
human
character
and
an
essentially
sane
outlook
is
somehow
incongruous
with
my
notions
my
mistaken
notions
if
you
will
of
what
she
ought
to
be
has
a
profound
knowledge
of
human
character
and
an
essentially
sane
outlook
said
one
of
the
critics
quoted
at
the
end
of
the
book
that
i
had
chosen
the
wind
and
the
rain
in
the
chimney
had
not
abated
but
the
fire
was
bearing
up
bravely
so
would
i
would
read
cheerfully
and
without
prejudice
i
poked
the
fire
and
pushing
my
chair
slightly
back
lest
the
heat
should
warp
the
book
s
covers
began
chapter
i
a
woman
sat
writing
in
a
at
the
end
of
a
small
garden
that
overlooked
a
great
valley
in
surrey
the
description
of
her
was
calculated
to
make
her
very
admirable
a
thorough
woman
not
strictly
beautiful
but
likely
to
be
thought
beautiful
by
those
who
knew
her
well
not
dressed
as
though
she
gave
much
heed
to
her
clothes
but
dressed
in
a
fashion
that
exactly
harmonised
with
her
special
type
her
pen
travelled
rapidly
across
the
foolscap
and
while
it
did
so
she
was
described
in
more
and
more
detail
but
at
length
she
came
to
a
knotty
point
in
what
she
was
writing
she
paused
she
pushed
back
the
hair
from
her
temples
she
looked
forth
at
the
valley
and
now
the
landscape
was
described
but
not
at
all
exhaustively
it
for
the
writer
soon
overcame
her
difficulty
and
her
pen
travelled
faster
than
ever
till
suddenly
there
was
a
cry
of
mammy
and
in
rushed
a
child
in
conjunction
with
whom
she
was
more
than
ever
admirable
after
which
the
narrative
skipped
back
across
eight
years
and
the
woman
became
a
girl
giving
as
yet
no
token
of
future
eminence
in
literature
but
i
had
an
impulse
which
i
obeyed
almost
before
i
was
conscious
of
it
nobody
could
have
been
more
surprised
than
i
was
at
what
i
had
done
done
so
neatly
so
quietly
and
gently
the
book
stood
closed
upright
with
its
back
to
me
just
as
on
a
behind
the
bars
of
the
grate
there
it
was
and
it
gave
forth
as
the
flames
crept
up
the
blue
cloth
sides
of
it
a
pleasant
though
acrid
smell
my
astonishment
had
passed
giving
place
to
an
exquisite
satisfaction
how
pottering
and
fumbling
a
thing
was
even
the
best
kind
of
written
criticism
i
understood
the
contempt
felt
by
the
man
of
action
for
the
man
of
words
but
what
pleased
me
most
was
that
at
last
actually
i
at
my
age
i
of
all
people
had
committed
a
crime
was
guilty
of
a
crime
i
had
power
to
revoke
it
i
might
write
to
my
bookseller
for
an
unburnt
copy
and
place
it
on
the
shelf
where
this
one
had
stood
this
gloriously
glowing
one
i
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
what
i
had
done
i
had
done
i
would
wear
forever
on
my
conscience
the
white
rose
of
theft
and
the
red
rose
of
arson
if
hereafter
the
owner
of
this
cottage
happened
to
miss
that
volume
let
him
if
he
were
fool
enough
to
write
to
me
about
it
would
i
share
my
grand
secret
with
him
no
gently
with
his
poker
i
prodded
that
volume
further
among
the
coals
the
binding
shot
forth
little
tongues
of
bright
colour
flamelets
of
sapphire
amethyst
emerald
charming
could
even
the
author
herself
not
admire
them
perhaps
poor
woman
i
had
scored
now
scored
so
perfectly
that
i
felt
myself
to
be
almost
a
brute
while
i
poked
off
the
loosened
black
outer
pages
and
led
the
fire
on
to
pages
that
were
but
pale
brown
these
were
quickly
devoured
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
whenever
i
left
the
fire
to
forage
for
itself
it
made
little
headway
i
pushed
the
book
over
on
its
side
the
flames
closed
on
it
but
presently
licking
their
lips
fell
back
as
though
they
had
had
enough
i
took
the
tongs
and
put
the
book
upright
again
and
raked
it
fore
and
aft
it
seemed
almost
as
thick
as
ever
with
poker
and
tongs
i
carved
it
into
two
three
sections
the
inner
pages
flashing
white
as
when
they
were
sent
to
the
binders
strange
aforetime
a
book
was
burnt
now
and
again
in
the
by
the
common
hangman
was
he
i
wondered
paid
by
the
hour
i
had
always
supposed
the
thing
quite
easy
for
him
a
bright
little
brisk
little
conflagration
and
so
home
perhaps
other
books
were
less
resistant
than
this
one
i
began
to
feel
that
the
critics
were
more
right
than
they
knew
here
was
a
book
that
had
indeed
an
intense
vitality
and
an
immense
vitality
it
was
a
book
that
would
live
do
what
one
might
i
vowed
it
should
not
i
subdivided
it
spread
it
redistributed
it
ever
and
anon
my
eye
would
be
caught
by
some
sentence
or
fragment
of
a
sentence
in
the
midst
of
a
charred
page
before
the
flames
crept
over
it
always
loathed
you
but
i
remember
and
think
tolstoi
was
right
who
had
always
loathed
whom
and
what
what
had
tolstoi
been
right
about
i
had
an
absurd
but
genuine
desire
to
know
too
late
confound
the
woman
she
was
scoring
again
i
furiously
drove
her
pages
into
the
yawning
crimson
jaws
of
the
coals
those
jaws
had
lately
been
golden
soon
to
my
horror
they
seemed
to
be
growing
grey
they
seemed
to
be
closing
on
nothing
flakes
of
black
paper
layers
of
paper
brown
and
white
began
to
hide
them
from
me
altogether
i
sprinkled
a
boxful
of
wax
matches
i
resumed
the
bellows
i
lunged
with
the
poker
i
held
a
newspaper
over
the
whole
grate
i
did
all
that
inspiration
could
suggest
or
skill
accomplish
vainly
the
fire
went
out
darkly
dismally
gradually
quite
out
how
she
had
scored
again
but
she
did
not
know
it
i
felt
no
bitterness
against
her
as
i
lay
back
in
my
chair
inert
listening
to
the
storm
that
was
still
raging
i
blamed
only
myself
i
had
done
wrong
the
small
room
became
very
cold
whose
fault
was
that
but
my
own
i
had
done
wrong
hastily
but
had
done
it
and
been
glad
of
it
i
had
not
remembered
the
words
a
wise
king
wrote
long
ago
that
the
lamp
of
the
wicked
shall
be
put
out
and
that
the
way
of
trangressors
is
hard
in
homes
unblest
nothing
is
more
pleasant
than
to
see
suddenly
endowed
with
motion
a
thing
stagnant
by
nature
the
hat
that
on
the
head
of
the
man
in
the
street
is
nothing
to
us
how
much
it
is
if
it
be
animated
by
a
gust
of
wind
there
is
no
churl
that
does
not
rejoice
with
it
in
its
strength
and
in
the
swiftness
and
cunning
that
baffle
its
pursuer
who
he
too
when
the
chase
is
over
bears
it
no
ill
will
at
all
for
its
escapade
i
know
families
that
have
sat
for
hours
for
hours
after
bedtime
mute
in
a
dim
light
pressing
a
table
with
their
and
ever
bringing
to
bear
the
full
force
of
their
minds
on
it
in
the
unconquerable
hope
that
it
would
move
conversely
nothing
is
more
dismal
than
to
see
set
in
permanent
rigidness
a
thing
whose
aspect
is
linked
for
us
with
the
idea
of
great
mobility
even
the
blithest
of
us
and
least
easily
depressed
would
make
a
long
detour
to
avoid
a
stuffed
squirrel
or
a
case
of
pinned
butterflies
and
you
can
well
imagine
with
what
a
sinking
of
the
heart
i
beheld
this
morning
on
a
road
near
the
coast
of
norfolk
a
without
wheels
without
wheels
though
it
was
it
had
motion
of
a
kind
of
a
kind
worse
than
actual
stagnation
mounted
on
a
very
long
that
groaned
and
panted
it
very
slowly
passed
me
i
noted
that
two
of
its
compartments
were
marked
first
the
rest
third
and
in
some
of
them
i
noted
you
might
smoke
but
of
this
opportunity
you
were
not
availing
yourself
all
the
compartments
the
cheap
and
the
dear
alike
were
vacant
they
were
transporting
air
only
and
this
i
conceived
abominable
the
sun
slanted
fiercely
down
on
the
old
iron
roof
the
old
wooden
walls
the
dingy
shut
windows
the
fume
and
grime
of
a
thousand
familiar
tunnels
of
year
after
year
of
journeys
by
night
journeys
by
day
from
time
immemorial
seemed
to
have
invested
the
whole
structure
with
a
character
that
shrank
from
the
sun
s
scrutiny
and
from
the
nearness
of
sea
and
fields
fuliginous
monstrous
slowly
shamefully
the
thing
went
by
to
what
final
goal
in
the
lovely
weather
there
attended
it
besides
the
driver
of
the
lorry
a
straggling
retinue
of
men
on
foot
mechanics
very
dusty
i
should
have
liked
to
question
one
or
another
of
these
as
to
their
mission
but
i
was
afraid
to
do
so
there
is
an
art
of
talking
acceptably
to
people
who
do
not
regard
themselves
as
members
of
one
s
own
class
and
i
have
never
acquired
it
i
suppose
the
first
step
is
to
forget
that
any
art
is
forget
that
one
must
not
be
so
wildly
cordial
for
fear
of
seeming
to
condescend
nor
be
more
than
a
trifle
saturnine
either
for
the
same
motive
or
am
i
wrong
the
whole
thing
is
a
mystery
to
me
all
i
know
is
that
if
i
had
asked
those
mechanics
what
they
were
doing
with
that
railway
car
they
would
have
seemed
to
suspect
me
of
meaning
that
it
was
my
property
and
that
they
had
stolen
it
or
perhaps
they
would
have
seemed
merely
to
resent
my
idle
curiosity
if
so
why
not
when
i
walk
abroad
with
a
sheaf
of
manuscript
in
my
hand
mechanics
do
not
stop
me
to
ask
what
s
that
what
s
it
about
who
s
going
to
publish
it
nor
is
this
because
times
having
changed
so
they
are
afraid
of
seeming
to
condescend
they
always
did
mind
their
own
business
and
now
that
their
own
business
is
so
much
more
lucrative
than
mine
they
still
follow
that
golden
rule
i
stood
gazing
back
at
the
procession
till
it
disappeared
round
a
bend
of
the
road
its
bequest
of
dust
and
smoke
was
quickly
spent
by
a
prodigal
young
breeze
landscape
and
seascape
were
reindued
with
their
full
amenities
ruskin
would
have
been
pleased
so
indeed
was
i
but
that
in
which
it
romantically
struck
me
i
myself
might
once
might
frequently
have
travelled
was
still
upmost
in
my
brooding
mind
to
what
manner
of
wretched
end
was
it
destined
no
end
would
have
seemed
bad
enough
for
it
to
ruskin
but
i
was
born
late
enough
to
acquiesce
in
railways
and
in
all
that
pertains
to
them
and
now
since
the
success
of
those
far
greater
because
unrestricted
bores
railways
have
taken
on
for
me
some
such
charm
as
the
memory
of
the
posting
coaches
had
for
the
greybeards
of
my
boyhood
some
such
charm
as
aeroplanes
may
in
the
fulness
of
time
foist
down
for
us
on
but
i
rove
like
sir
thomas
more
and
i
seem
to
think
that
a
cheap
literary
allusion
will
make
you
excuse
that
vice
to
resume
my
breathless
narrative
i
decided
that
i
would
slowly
follow
the
tracks
of
the
lorry
i
supposed
that
these
were
leading
me
to
some
great
filled
with
the
remains
of
other
foully
scrapped
for
some
fell
industrial
purpose
but
this
was
a
bad
guess
the
tracks
led
me
at
last
through
a
lane
and
thence
into
sight
of
a
little
bay
on
whose
waters
were
perceptible
the
deck
heads
of
sundry
human
beings
and
on
its
sands
the
of
sundry
other
human
beings
in
reading
novels
or
merely
basking
there
was
nowhere
any
sign
of
industrialism
more
than
ever
was
i
intrigued
as
to
the
fate
of
the
old
that
i
had
been
stalking
it
and
its
lorry
had
halted
on
the
flat
grassy
land
that
fringed
the
sands
this
land
was
dominated
by
a
crescent
of
queer
little
garish
tenements
the
like
of
which
i
had
never
seen
nor
would
wish
to
see
again
they
did
not
stand
on
the
ground
but
on
stakes
of
wood
and
shafts
of
brick
six
feet
or
so
above
the
ground
s
level
and
were
led
up
to
by
flights
of
wooden
steps
that
tried
not
to
look
like
ladders
they
displeased
me
much
they
had
little
railed
platforms
round
them
and
things
hanging
out
to
dry
on
the
railings
and
their
walls
vied
unneighbourly
with
one
another
in
lawless
one
tenement
was
with
wide
bands
of
scarlet
another
with
a
in
orange
and
so
on
around
the
whole
little
horrid
array
and
i
deduced
from
certain
upstanding
stakes
and
shafts
at
the
nearer
end
of
the
crescent
that
the
horror
was
not
complete
yet
a
suspicion
dawned
in
me
and
became
while
i
gazed
again
at
the
crescent
s
facades
a
glaring
certainty
in
the
light
of
which
i
saw
that
i
had
been
wrong
about
the
old
defunct
it
was
not
to
die
it
was
to
have
a
new
function
i
had
once
heard
that
disused
were
convertible
into
cottages
but
the
news
had
not
fired
my
imagination
nor
protruded
in
my
memory
as
an
of
the
accomplished
fact
i
was
impressed
sharply
enough
and
i
went
nearer
to
the
crescent
drawn
by
a
sort
of
dreadful
fascination
i
found
that
the
cottages
all
had
names
one
cottage
was
mermaid
s
rock
another
which
had
fluttering
of
stuart
tartan
spray
o
the
sea
another
the
nest
another
brinynook
and
yet
another
had
been
named
with
less
fitness
but
in
an
ampler
and
to
me
more
interesting
spirit
petworth
i
looked
from
them
to
the
it
had
a
wonderful
dignity
in
its
austere
and
monumental
way
it
was
very
beautiful
it
was
a
noble
work
of
man
and
nature
smiled
on
it
i
wondered
with
what
colours
it
was
to
be
bejezebelled
and
what
name
bolton
abbey
glad
eye
gay
wee
gehenna
it
would
have
to
bear
and
what
manner
of
man
or
woman
was
going
to
rent
it
it
was
on
this
last
point
that
i
mused
especially
the
housing
problem
is
hard
doubtless
but
nobody
my
mind
protested
as
i
surveyed
the
crescent
nobody
is
driven
to
so
desperate
a
solution
of
it
as
this
there
are
tents
there
are
caves
there
are
hollow
trees
and
there
are
people
who
prefer
this
yes
this
is
a
positive
taste
not
a
necessity
at
all
i
swept
the
bay
with
a
searching
eye
but
heads
on
the
surface
of
water
tell
nothing
to
the
sociologist
and
in
even
on
the
sand
give
him
no
clue
three
or
four
of
the
had
risen
and
strolled
up
to
the
lorry
around
which
the
mechanics
were
engaged
in
some
dispute
of
a
technical
nature
i
hoped
the
would
have
something
to
say
too
but
they
said
nothing
this
i
set
down
to
sheer
perversity
i
was
more
than
three
miles
from
the
place
where
i
am
sojourning
and
the
hour
for
luncheon
was
nearly
due
i
left
the
bay
without
having
been
able
to
determine
the
character
the
kind
of
its
denizens
i
take
it
there
is
a
strong
tincture
of
bohemianism
in
them
desmond
maccarthy
of
whose
judgment
i
am
always
trustful
has
said
that
the
hallmark
of
bohemianism
is
a
tendency
to
use
things
for
purposes
to
which
they
are
not
adapted
you
are
a
bohemian
says
maccarthy
if
you
would
gladly
use
a
razor
for
buttering
your
toast
at
breakfast
and
you
aren
t
if
you
wouldn
t
i
think
he
would
agree
that
the
choice
of
a
home
is
a
surer
index
than
any
fleeting
action
however
strange
and
that
really
the
bohemians
are
they
who
choose
to
reside
in
on
stilts
but
why
particularly
that
is
a
difficult
question
a
possible
answer
is
that
the
bohemian
as
tending
always
to
nomady
feels
that
the
least
uncongenial
way
of
settling
down
is
to
stow
himself
into
a
thing
fashioned
for
darting
hither
and
thither
yet
no
this
answer
won
t
do
it
is
ruled
out
by
the
law
i
laid
down
in
my
first
paragraph
there
s
nothing
sadder
to
eye
or
heart
than
a
very
mobile
thing
made
immovable
no
house
especially
if
you
are
by
way
of
being
nomadic
can
be
so
ill
to
live
in
as
one
that
in
its
heyday
went
gadding
all
over
the
place
and
on
the
other
hand
what
house
more
eligible
than
one
that
can
gad
i
myself
am
not
restless
and
am
fond
of
comfort
i
should
not
care
to
live
in
a
caravan
but
i
have
always
liked
the
idea
of
a
caravan
and
if
you
alas
o
reader
are
a
dweller
in
a
i
commend
the
idea
to
you
take
it
with
my
apologies
for
any
words
of
mine
that
may
have
nettled
you
put
it
into
practice
think
of
the
white
road
and
the
shifting
hedgerows
and
the
counties
that
you
will
soon
lose
count
of
and
think
what
a
blessing
it
will
be
for
you
to
know
that
your
house
is
not
the
one
in
which
the
merstham
tunnel
murder
was
committed
william
and
mary
memories
like
olives
are
an
acquired
taste
william
and
mary
i
give
them
the
christian
names
that
were
indeed
theirs
the
joint
title
by
which
their
friends
always
referred
to
them
were
for
some
years
an
interest
in
my
life
and
had
a
hold
on
my
affection
but
a
time
came
when
though
i
had
known
and
liked
them
too
well
ever
to
forget
them
i
gave
them
but
a
few
thoughts
now
and
then
how
being
dead
could
they
keep
their
place
in
the
mind
of
a
young
man
surrounded
with
large
and
constantly
renewed
consignments
of
the
living
as
one
grows
older
the
charm
of
novelty
wears
off
one
finds
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
novelty
or
at
any
rate
that
one
has
lost
the
faculty
for
perceiving
it
one
sees
every
newcomer
not
as
something
strange
and
special
but
as
a
ticketed
specimen
of
this
or
that
very
familiar
genus
the
world
has
ceased
to
be
remarkable
and
one
tends
to
think
more
and
more
often
of
the
days
when
it
was
so
very
remarkable
indeed
i
suppose
that
had
i
been
thirty
years
older
when
first
i
knew
him
william
would
have
seemed
to
me
little
worthier
of
attention
than
a
twopenny
seems
yet
no
william
really
had
some
oddities
that
would
have
caught
even
an
oldster
s
eye
in
himself
he
was
commonplace
enough
as
i
coeval
though
i
was
with
him
soon
saw
but
in
details
of
surface
he
was
unusual
in
them
he
happened
to
be
rather
ahead
of
his
time
he
was
a
socialist
for
example
in
there
was
only
one
other
socialist
in
oxford
and
he
not
at
all
an
undergraduate
but
a
retired
named
hines
who
made
speeches
to
which
nobody
except
perhaps
william
listened
near
the
martyrs
memorial
and
william
wore
a
flannel
shirt
and
rode
a
bicycle
very
strange
habits
in
those
days
and
very
horrible
he
was
said
to
be
though
he
was
and
wore
glasses
a
back
at
football
but
as
football
was
a
thing
frowned
on
by
the
rowing
men
and
coldly
ignored
by
the
bloods
his
talent
for
it
did
not
help
him
he
was
one
of
the
principal
pariahs
of
our
college
and
it
was
rather
in
a
spirit
of
bravado
and
to
show
how
sure
of
myself
i
was
that
i
began
in
my
second
year
to
cultivate
his
acquaintance
we
had
little
in
common
i
could
not
think
political
economy
the
most
exciting
thing
in
the
world
as
he
used
to
call
it
nor
could
i
without
yawning
listen
to
more
than
a
few
lines
of
william
morris
interminable
smooth
icelandic
sagas
which
my
friend
pious
young
socialist
that
he
was
thought
he
had
begun
to
write
an
icelandic
saga
himself
and
had
already
achieved
some
hundreds
of
verses
none
of
these
pleased
him
though
to
me
they
seemed
very
like
his
master
s
i
can
see
him
now
standing
on
his
holding
his
close
to
his
eyes
declaiming
the
verses
and
trying
with
many
angular
gestures
of
his
left
hand
to
animate
them
a
tall
broad
fellow
with
long
brown
hair
flung
back
from
his
forehead
and
a
very
shabby
suit
of
clothes
because
of
his
clothes
and
his
socialism
and
his
habit
of
offering
beer
to
a
guest
i
had
at
first
supposed
him
quite
poor
and
i
was
surprised
when
he
told
me
that
he
had
from
his
guardian
his
parents
being
dead
an
allowance
of
and
that
when
he
came
of
age
he
would
have
an
income
of
all
out
of
dividends
he
would
groan
i
would
hint
that
hines
and
similar
zealots
might
disembarrass
him
of
this
load
if
he
asked
them
nicely
no
he
would
say
quite
seriously
i
can
t
do
that
and
would
read
out
passages
from
fabian
essays
to
show
that
in
the
present
anarchical
conditions
only
mischief
could
result
from
sporadic
dispersal
of
rent
ten
twelve
years
hence
he
would
muse
more
hopefully
but
by
that
time
i
would
say
you
ll
probably
be
married
and
your
wife
mightn
t
quite
whereat
he
would
hotly
repeat
what
he
had
said
many
times
that
he
would
never
marry
marriage
was
an
anachronism
i
think
its
survival
wasin
some
part
due
to
the
machinations
of
capital
anyway
it
was
doomed
temporary
civil
contracts
between
men
and
women
would
be
the
rule
ten
twelve
years
hence
pending
which
time
the
lot
of
any
man
who
had
civic
sense
must
be
celibacy
tempered
perhaps
with
free
love
long
before
that
time
was
up
nevertheless
william
married
one
afternoon
in
the
spring
of
i
happened
to
meet
him
at
a
corner
of
cockspur
street
i
wondered
at
the
immense
cordiality
of
his
greeting
for
our
friendship
such
as
it
was
had
waned
in
our
two
final
years
at
oxford
you
look
very
flourishing
and
i
said
you
re
wearing
a
new
suit
i
m
married
he
replied
obviously
without
a
twinge
of
conscience
he
told
me
he
had
been
married
just
a
month
he
declared
that
to
be
married
was
the
most
splendid
thing
in
all
the
world
but
he
weakened
the
force
of
this
generalisation
by
adding
that
there
never
was
any
one
like
his
wife
you
must
see
her
he
said
and
his
impatience
to
show
her
proudly
off
to
some
one
was
so
evident
and
so
touching
that
i
could
but
accept
his
invitation
to
go
and
stay
with
them
for
two
or
three
days
why
not
next
week
they
had
taken
and
furnished
a
sort
of
cottage
in
shire
and
this
was
their
home
he
had
run
up
for
the
day
on
business
journalism
and
was
now
on
his
way
to
charing
cross
i
know
you
ll
like
my
wife
he
said
at
parting
she
s
well
she
s
as
this
was
the
epithet
he
had
erst
applied
to
beowulf
and
to
sigurd
the
volsung
it
raised
no
high
hopes
and
indeed
as
i
was
soon
to
find
he
had
again
misused
it
there
was
nothing
glorious
about
his
bride
some
people
might
even
have
not
thought
her
pretty
i
myself
did
not
in
the
flash
of
first
sight
neat
insignificant
pleasing
was
what
she
appeared
to
me
rather
than
pretty
and
far
rather
than
glorious
in
an
age
of
fringes
her
brow
was
severely
bare
she
looked
but
an
instant
later
when
she
smiled
i
saw
that
she
was
pretty
too
and
presently
i
thought
her
delightful
william
had
met
me
in
a
governess
cart
and
we
went
to
see
him
unharness
the
pony
he
did
this
in
a
fumbling
experimental
way
confusing
the
reins
with
the
traces
and
profiting
so
little
by
his
wife
s
directions
that
she
began
to
laugh
and
her
laugh
was
a
lovely
thing
quite
a
small
sound
but
exquisitely
clear
and
gay
coming
in
a
sequence
of
notes
that
neither
rose
nor
fell
that
were
quite
even
a
trill
of
notes
and
then
another
and
another
as
though
she
were
pulling
repeatedly
a
little
silver
bell
as
i
describe
it
perhaps
the
sound
may
be
imagined
irritating
i
can
only
say
it
was
enchanting
i
wished
she
would
go
on
laughing
but
she
ceased
she
darted
forward
and
william
standing
obediently
aside
and
i
helping
unhelpfully
unharnessed
the
pony
herself
and
led
it
into
its
small
stable
decidedly
she
was
practical
but
i
was
prepared
now
to
be
lenient
to
any
quality
she
might
have
had
she
been
feckless
no
doubt
i
should
have
forgiven
her
that
too
but
i
might
have
enjoyed
my
visit
less
than
i
did
and
might
have
been
less
pleased
to
go
often
again
i
had
expected
to
rough
it
under
william
s
roof
but
everything
thereunder
within
the
limits
of
a
strict
arcadian
simplicity
was
i
was
touched
when
i
went
to
my
bedroom
by
the
precision
with
which
the
very
small
maid
had
unpacked
and
disposed
my
things
and
i
wondered
where
my
hostess
had
got
the
lore
she
had
so
evidently
imparted
certainly
not
from
william
perhaps
it
only
now
strikes
me
from
a
handbook
for
mary
was
great
at
handbooks
she
had
handbooks
about
gardening
and
others
about
poultry
and
one
about
the
stable
and
others
on
cognate
themes
from
these
she
had
filled
up
the
gaps
left
in
her
education
by
her
father
who
was
a
widower
and
either
a
doctor
or
a
solicitor
i
forget
which
in
one
of
the
smallest
towns
of
an
adjoining
county
and
i
daresay
she
may
have
had
somewhere
hidden
away
a
manual
for
young
hostesses
if
so
it
must
have
been
a
good
one
but
to
say
this
is
to
belittle
mary
s
powers
of
intuition
it
was
they
sharpened
by
her
adoration
of
william
and
by
her
intensity
for
everything
around
him
that
made
her
so
efficient
a
housewife
if
she
possessed
a
manual
for
young
it
was
assuredly
not
by
the
light
of
this
that
she
had
chosen
the
home
they
were
installed
in
the
sort
of
cottage
had
been
vacant
for
many
years
an
unpromising
and
ineligible
object
a
mile
away
from
a
village
and
three
miles
away
from
a
railway
station
the
main
part
of
it
was
an
actual
cottage
of
workmanship
but
a
little
stuccoed
wing
had
been
added
to
each
side
of
it
in
or
thereabouts
by
an
eccentric
old
gentleman
who
at
that
time
chose
to
make
it
his
home
he
had
added
also
the
small
stable
a
dairy
and
other
appanages
for
these
and
for
garden
there
was
plenty
of
room
as
he
had
purchased
and
enclosed
half
an
acre
of
the
surrounding
land
those
two
stuccoed
very
victorian
wings
of
his
each
with
a
above
and
a
french
window
below
consorted
queerly
with
the
old
red
brick
and
the
latticed
panes
and
the
long
wooden
veranda
that
he
had
invoked
did
not
unify
the
trinity
but
one
didn
t
want
it
to
the
wrongness
had
a
character
all
its
own
the
wrongness
was
right
at
any
rate
after
mary
had
hit
on
it
for
william
as
a
spinster
she
would
i
think
have
been
happiest
in
a
trim
modern
villa
but
it
was
a
belief
of
hers
that
she
had
married
a
man
of
strange
genius
she
had
married
him
for
himself
not
for
his
genius
but
this
added
grace
in
him
was
a
thing
to
be
reckoned
with
ever
so
much
a
thing
she
must
coddle
to
the
utmost
in
a
proper
setting
she
was
a
year
older
than
he
though
being
so
small
and
slight
she
looked
several
years
younger
and
in
her
devotion
the
maternal
instinct
played
a
great
part
william
as
i
have
already
conveyed
to
you
was
not
greatly
gifted
mary
s
instinct
in
this
one
matter
was
at
fault
but
endearingly
rightly
at
fault
and
as
william
was
outwardly
odd
wasn
t
it
well
that
his
home
should
be
so
too
on
the
inside
comfort
was
what
mary
always
aimed
at
for
him
and
achieved
the
ground
floor
had
all
been
made
one
room
into
which
you
stepped
straight
from
the
open
air
quite
a
long
big
room
or
so
it
seemed
from
the
lowness
of
the
ceiling
and
in
its
antiquity
with
here
and
there
on
the
irregular
red
tiles
and
very
white
whitewash
on
the
plaster
between
the
rafters
this
was
the
and
general
focus
throughout
the
day
and
was
called
simply
the
room
william
had
a
den
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
left
wing
and
there
in
the
mornings
he
used
to
write
a
great
deal
mary
had
no
special
place
of
her
own
her
place
was
wherever
her
duties
needed
her
william
wrote
reviews
of
books
for
the
daily
he
did
also
creative
work
the
vein
of
poetry
in
him
had
worked
itself
out
or
rather
it
expressed
itself
for
him
in
mary
for
technical
purposes
the
influence
of
ibsen
had
superseded
that
of
morris
at
the
time
of
my
first
visit
he
was
writing
an
extraordinarily
gloomy
play
about
an
extraordinarily
unhappy
marriage
in
subsequent
seasons
ibsen
s
disc
having
been
somehow
eclipsed
for
him
by
george
gissing
s
he
was
usually
writing
novels
in
which
every
one
or
do
i
exaggerate
had
made
a
disastrous
match
i
think
mary
s
belief
in
his
genius
had
made
him
less
diffident
than
he
was
at
oxford
he
was
always
emerging
from
his
den
with
fresh
pages
of
into
the
room
you
don
t
mind
he
would
say
waving
his
pages
and
then
would
shout
mary
she
was
always
promptly
forthcoming
sometimes
from
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
in
a
white
apron
sometimes
from
the
garden
in
a
blue
one
she
never
looked
at
him
while
he
read
to
do
so
would
have
been
lacking
in
respect
for
his
work
it
was
on
this
that
she
must
concentrate
her
whole
mind
privileged
auditor
that
she
was
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
with
her
lips
slightly
compressed
and
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
i
used
to
wonder
that
there
had
been
that
first
moment
when
i
did
not
think
her
pretty
her
eyes
were
of
a
very
light
hazel
seeming
all
the
lighter
because
her
hair
was
of
so
dark
a
brown
and
they
were
beautifully
set
in
a
face
of
that
pinched
oval
kind
which
is
rather
rare
in
england
mary
as
listener
would
have
atoned
to
me
for
any
defects
there
may
have
been
in
dear
old
william
s
work
nevertheless
i
sometimes
wished
this
work
had
some
comic
relief
in
it
publishers
i
believe
shared
this
wish
hence
the
eternal
absence
of
william
s
name
from
among
their
announcements
for
mary
s
sake
and
his
i
should
have
liked
him
to
be
but
at
any
rate
he
didn
t
need
money
he
didn
t
need
in
addition
to
what
he
had
what
he
made
by
his
journalism
and
as
for
success
well
didn
t
mary
think
him
a
genius
and
wasn
t
he
mary
s
husband
the
main
reason
why
i
wished
for
light
passages
in
what
he
read
to
us
was
that
they
would
have
been
cues
for
mary
s
laugh
this
was
a
thing
always
new
to
me
i
never
tired
of
that
little
euphony
those
funny
little
lucid
and
level
trills
there
was
no
stint
of
that
charm
when
william
was
not
reading
to
us
mary
was
in
no
awe
of
him
apart
from
his
work
and
in
no
awe
at
all
of
me
she
used
to
laugh
at
us
both
for
one
thing
and
another
just
the
same
laugh
as
i
had
first
heard
when
william
tried
to
unharness
the
pony
i
cultivated
in
myself
whatever
amused
her
in
me
i
drew
out
whatever
amused
her
in
william
i
never
let
slip
any
of
the
things
that
amused
her
in
herself
chaff
is
a
great
bond
and
i
should
have
enjoyed
our
bouts
of
it
even
without
mary
s
own
special
obbligato
she
used
to
call
me
for
i
was
very
urban
in
those
days
the
gentleman
from
london
i
used
to
call
her
the
brave
little
woman
whatever
either
of
us
said
or
did
could
be
twisted
easily
into
relation
to
those
two
titles
and
our
bouts
to
which
william
listened
with
a
puzzled
benevolent
smile
used
to
cease
only
because
mary
regarded
me
as
a
possible
purveyor
of
what
william
she
was
sure
wanted
and
needed
down
there
in
the
country
alone
with
her
intellectual
conversation
after
his
work
she
often
i
think
invented
duties
in
garden
or
kitchen
so
that
he
should
have
this
stimulus
or
luxury
without
hindrance
but
when
william
was
alone
with
me
it
was
about
her
that
he
liked
to
talk
and
that
i
myself
liked
to
talk
too
he
was
very
sound
on
the
subject
of
mary
and
so
was
i
and
if
when
i
was
alone
with
mary
i
seemed
to
be
sounder
than
i
was
on
the
subject
of
william
s
wonderfulness
who
shall
blame
me
had
mary
been
a
mother
william
s
wonderfulness
would
have
been
less
greatly
important
but
he
was
her
child
as
well
as
her
lover
and
i
think
though
i
do
not
know
she
believed
herself
content
that
this
should
always
be
if
so
it
were
destined
it
was
not
destined
so
on
the
first
night
of
a
visit
i
paid
them
in
april
william
when
we
were
alone
told
me
news
i
had
been
vaguely
conscious
throughout
the
evening
of
some
change
conscious
that
mary
had
grown
gayer
and
less
gay
somehow
different
somehow
remote
william
said
that
her
child
would
be
born
in
september
if
all
went
well
she
s
immensely
happy
he
told
me
i
realised
that
she
was
indeed
happier
than
ever
and
of
course
it
would
be
a
wonderful
thing
for
both
of
us
he
said
presently
to
have
a
son
or
a
i
asked
him
which
he
would
rather
it
were
a
son
or
a
daughter
oh
either
he
answered
wearily
it
was
evident
that
he
had
misgivings
and
fears
i
tried
to
reason
him
out
of
them
he
did
not
i
am
thankful
to
say
ever
let
mary
suspect
them
she
had
no
misgivings
but
it
was
destined
that
her
child
should
live
only
for
an
hour
and
that
she
should
die
in
bearing
it
i
had
stayed
again
at
the
cottage
in
july
for
some
days
at
the
end
of
that
month
i
had
gone
to
france
as
was
my
custom
and
a
week
later
had
written
to
mary
it
was
william
that
answered
this
letter
telling
me
of
mary
s
death
and
burial
i
returned
to
england
next
day
william
and
i
wrote
to
each
other
several
times
he
had
not
left
his
home
he
stayed
there
trying
as
he
said
in
a
grotesque
and
phrase
to
finish
a
i
saw
him
in
the
following
january
he
wrote
to
me
from
the
charing
cross
hotel
asking
me
to
lunch
with
him
there
after
our
first
greetings
there
was
a
silence
he
wanted
to
talk
of
what
he
could
not
talk
of
we
stared
helplessly
at
each
other
and
then
in
the
english
way
talked
of
things
at
large
england
was
engaged
in
the
boer
war
william
was
the
sort
of
man
whom
one
would
have
expected
to
be
violently
i
was
surprised
at
his
fervour
for
the
stronger
side
he
told
me
he
had
tried
to
enlist
but
had
been
rejected
on
account
of
his
eyesight
but
there
was
he
said
a
good
chance
of
his
being
sent
out
almost
immediately
as
one
of
the
daily
s
special
correspondents
and
then
he
exclaimed
i
shall
see
something
of
i
had
a
presentiment
that
he
would
not
return
and
a
belief
that
he
did
not
want
to
return
he
did
not
return
special
correspondents
were
not
so
carefully
shepherded
in
that
war
as
they
have
since
been
they
were
more
at
liberty
to
take
risks
on
behalf
of
the
journals
to
which
they
were
accredited
william
was
killed
a
few
weeks
after
he
had
landed
at
cape
town
and
there
came
as
i
have
said
a
time
when
i
did
not
think
of
william
and
mary
often
and
then
a
time
when
i
did
more
often
think
of
them
and
especially
much
did
my
mind
hark
back
to
them
in
the
late
autumn
of
last
year
for
on
the
way
to
the
place
i
was
staying
at
i
had
passed
the
little
railway
station
whose
name
had
always
linked
itself
for
me
with
the
names
of
those
two
friends
there
were
but
four
intervening
stations
it
was
not
a
difficult
pilgrimage
that
i
made
some
days
later
back
towards
the
past
for
that
past
s
sake
and
honour
i
had
thought
i
should
not
remember
the
way
the
three
miles
of
way
from
the
station
to
the
cottage
but
i
found
myself
remembering
it
perfectly
without
a
glance
at
the
rain
had
been
falling
heavily
driving
the
late
leaves
off
the
trees
and
everything
looked
rather
sodden
and
misty
though
the
sun
was
now
shining
i
had
known
this
landscape
only
in
spring
summer
early
autumn
mary
had
held
to
a
theory
that
at
other
seasons
i
could
not
be
acclimatised
but
there
were
groups
of
trees
that
i
knew
even
without
their
leaves
and
and
small
stone
bridges
that
had
not
at
all
changed
only
what
mattered
was
changed
only
what
mattered
was
gone
would
what
i
had
come
to
see
be
there
still
in
comparison
with
what
it
had
held
it
was
not
much
but
i
wished
to
see
it
melancholy
spectacle
though
it
must
be
for
me
if
it
were
extant
and
worse
than
melancholy
if
it
held
something
new
i
began
to
be
sure
it
had
been
demolished
built
over
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
that
had
led
to
it
i
was
almost
minded
to
explore
no
further
to
turn
back
but
i
went
on
and
suddenly
i
was
at
the
iron
gate
that
i
remembered
between
the
laurels
it
was
rusty
and
was
fastened
with
a
rusty
padlock
and
beyond
it
there
was
grass
where
a
winding
drive
had
been
from
the
lane
the
cottage
never
had
been
visible
even
when
these
laurels
were
lower
and
sparser
than
they
were
now
was
the
cottage
still
standing
presently
i
climbed
over
the
gate
and
walked
through
the
long
grass
and
yes
there
was
mary
s
cottage
still
there
william
s
and
mary
s
cottage
trite
enough
i
have
no
doubt
were
the
thoughts
that
possessed
me
as
i
stood
gazing
there
is
nothing
new
to
be
thought
about
the
evanescence
of
human
things
but
there
is
always
much
to
be
felt
about
it
by
one
who
encounters
in
his
maturity
some
such
intimate
instance
and
reminder
as
confronted
me
in
that
cold
sunshine
across
that
small
wilderness
of
long
rank
wet
grass
and
weeds
incredibly
woebegone
and
lonesome
the
house
would
have
looked
even
to
one
for
whom
it
contained
no
memories
all
the
more
because
in
its
utter
dereliction
it
looked
so
durable
some
of
the
stucco
had
fallen
off
the
walls
of
the
two
wings
thick
flakes
of
it
lay
on
the
discoloured
roof
of
the
veranda
and
thick
flakes
of
it
could
be
seen
lying
in
the
grass
below
otherwise
there
were
few
signs
of
actual
decay
the
and
the
french
window
of
each
wing
were
shuttered
and
from
where
i
was
standing
the
paint
of
those
shutters
behind
the
glass
looked
almost
fresh
the
latticed
windows
between
had
all
been
boarded
up
from
within
the
house
was
not
to
be
let
perish
soon
i
did
not
want
to
go
nearer
to
it
yet
i
did
go
nearer
step
by
step
across
the
wilderness
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
veranda
itself
and
within
a
yard
of
the
i
stood
looking
at
that
door
i
had
never
noticed
it
in
the
old
days
for
then
it
had
always
stood
open
but
it
asserted
itself
now
master
of
the
threshold
it
was
a
narrow
door
narrow
even
for
its
height
which
did
not
exceed
mine
by
more
than
two
inches
or
so
a
door
that
even
when
it
was
freshly
painted
must
have
looked
mean
how
much
meaner
now
with
its
paint
all
faded
and
mottled
cracked
and
blistered
it
had
no
knocker
not
even
a
slit
for
letters
all
that
it
had
was
a
on
this
my
eyes
rested
and
presently
i
moved
to
it
stooped
down
to
it
peered
through
it
i
had
a
glimpse
of
darkness
impenetrable
strange
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
stood
back
that
there
the
room
was
the
remembered
room
itself
separated
from
me
by
nothing
but
this
unremembered
door
and
a
quarter
of
a
century
yes
i
saw
it
all
in
my
mind
s
eye
just
as
it
had
been
the
way
the
sunlight
came
into
it
through
this
same
doorway
and
through
the
lattices
of
these
same
four
windows
the
way
the
little
bit
of
a
staircase
came
down
into
it
so
crookedly
yet
so
confidently
and
how
uneven
the
tiled
floor
was
and
how
low
the
rafters
were
and
how
littered
the
whole
place
was
with
books
brought
in
from
his
den
by
william
and
how
bright
with
flowers
brought
in
by
mary
from
her
garden
the
rafters
the
stairs
the
tiles
were
still
existing
changeless
in
despite
of
cobwebs
and
dust
and
darkness
all
quite
changeless
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
so
near
to
me
i
wondered
how
i
should
feel
if
by
some
enchantment
the
door
slowly
turned
on
its
hinges
letting
in
light
i
should
not
enter
i
felt
not
even
look
so
much
must
i
hate
to
see
those
inner
things
lasting
when
all
that
had
given
to
them
a
meaning
was
gone
from
them
taken
away
from
them
finally
and
yet
why
blame
them
for
their
survival
and
how
know
that
nothing
of
the
past
ever
came
to
them
revisiting
hovering
something
sometimes
perhaps
one
knew
so
little
how
not
be
tender
to
what
as
it
seemed
to
me
perhaps
the
dead
loved
so
strong
in
me
now
was
the
wish
to
see
again
all
those
things
to
touch
them
and
as
it
were
commune
with
them
and
so
queerly
may
the
mind
be
wrought
upon
in
a
solitude
among
memories
that
there
were
moments
when
i
almost
expected
that
the
door
would
obey
my
will
i
was
recalled
to
a
clearer
sense
of
reality
by
something
which
i
had
not
before
noticed
in
the
to
the
right
was
a
small
knob
of
rusty
iron
mocking
reminder
that
to
gain
admission
to
a
house
one
does
not
will
the
door
one
rings
the
bell
unless
it
is
rusty
and
has
quite
obviously
no
one
to
answer
it
in
which
case
one
goes
away
yet
i
did
not
go
away
the
movement
that
i
made
in
despite
of
myself
was
towards
the
knob
itself
but
i
hesitated
suppose
i
did
what
i
half
meant
to
do
and
there
were
no
sound
that
would
be
ghastly
and
surely
there
would
be
no
sound
and
if
sound
there
were
wouldn
t
that
be
worse
still
my
hand
drew
back
wavered
suddenly
closed
on
the
knob
i
heard
the
scrape
of
the
wire
and
then
from
somewhere
within
the
heart
of
the
shut
house
a
tinkle
it
had
been
the
weakest
the
puniest
of
noises
it
had
been
no
more
than
is
a
fledgling
s
first
attempt
at
a
twitter
but
i
was
not
judging
it
by
its
volume
deafening
peals
from
steeples
had
meant
less
to
me
than
that
one
single
note
breaking
the
silence
in
there
in
there
in
the
dark
the
bell
that
had
answered
me
was
still
quivering
i
supposed
on
its
wire
but
there
was
no
one
to
answer
it
no
footstep
to
come
hither
from
those
recesses
making
prints
in
the
dust
well
i
could
answer
it
and
again
my
hand
closed
on
the
knob
unhesitatingly
this
time
pulling
further
that
was
my
answer
and
the
rejoinder
to
it
was
more
than
i
had
thought
to
hear
a
whole
quick
sequence
of
notes
faint
but
clear
playful
yet
poignantly
sad
like
a
trill
of
laughter
echoing
out
of
the
past
or
even
merely
out
of
this
neighbouring
darkness
it
was
so
like
something
i
had
known
so
recognisable
and
oh
recognising
that
i
was
lost
in
wonder
and
long
must
i
have
remained
standing
at
that
door
for
i
heard
the
sound
often
often
i
must
have
rung
again
and
again
tenaciously
vehemently
in
my
folly
on
speaking
french
wherever
two
englishmen
are
speaking
french
to
a
frenchman
you
may
safely
diagnose
in
the
breast
of
one
of
the
two
humiliation
envy
impotent
rage
and
a
dull
yearning
for
vengeance
and
you
can
take
it
that
the
degree
of
these
emotions
is
in
exact
ratio
to
the
superiority
of
the
other
man
s
performance
in
the
breast
of
this
other
are
contempt
malicious
amusement
conceit
vanity
pity
and
joy
in
ostentation
these
also
exactly
commensurable
with
his
advantage
strange
and
sad
that
this
should
be
so
but
so
it
is
french
brings
out
the
worst
in
all
of
us
all
i
mean
but
the
few
the
lamentably
far
too
few
who
can
not
aspire
to
stammer
some
colloquial
phrases
of
it
even
in
victorian
days
when
england
was
more
than
geographically
was
psychologically
an
island
french
made
mischief
among
us
and
was
one
of
the
devil
s
favourite
ways
of
setting
brother
against
brother
but
in
those
days
the
bitterness
of
the
weaker
brother
was
a
little
sweetened
with
disapproval
of
the
stronger
to
speak
french
fluently
and
idiomatically
and
with
a
good
accent
or
with
an
idiom
and
accent
which
to
other
rough
islanders
seemed
good
was
a
rather
suspect
accomplishment
being
somehow
deemed
incompatible
with
civic
worth
thus
the
weaker
ones
had
not
to
drain
the
last
lees
of
their
shame
and
the
stronger
could
not
wholly
rejoice
in
their
strength
but
the
old
saving
prejudice
has
now
died
out
greatly
to
the
delight
of
the
devil
and
there
seems
no
chance
that
it
will
be
revived
of
other
languages
no
harm
comes
none
of
us
none
at
any
rate
outside
the
diplomatic
service
has
a
feeling
that
he
ought
to
be
master
of
them
in
every
recent
generation
a
few
men
have
learned
italian
because
of
the
divina
commedia
and
a
very
few
others
have
tried
spanish
with
a
view
to
cervantes
and
german
has
pestered
not
always
vainly
the
consciences
of
young
men
gravitating
to
philosophy
or
to
science
but
not
for
social
not
for
any
oral
purposes
were
these
languages
essayed
if
an
italian
or
a
spanish
or
a
german
came
among
us
he
was
expected
to
converse
in
english
or
spend
his
time
in
visiting
the
sights
silently
and
alone
no
language
except
french
has
ever
but
stay
there
was
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
a
great
impulse
towards
russian
all
sorts
of
people
wanted
their
children
to
be
taught
russian
without
a
moment
s
delay
i
do
not
remember
that
they
wanted
to
learn
it
themselves
but
they
felt
an
extreme
need
that
their
offspring
should
hereafter
be
able
to
converse
with
moujiks
about
ikons
and
the
little
father
and
anything
else
if
there
were
anything
else
that
moujiks
cared
about
this
need
however
is
not
felt
now
when
so
soon
after
his
de
but
in
high
politics
kerensky
was
superseded
by
lenin
russian
was
forthwith
deemed
a
not
quite
nice
language
even
for
children
russia
s
alphabet
was
withdrawn
from
the
nurseries
as
abruptly
as
it
had
been
brought
in
and
le
chapeau
de
la
cousine
du
jardinier
was
with
its
old
importance
i
doubt
whether
russian
would
for
more
than
a
little
while
have
seemed
to
be
a
likely
rival
of
french
even
if
kerensky
had
been
the
strong
man
we
hoped
he
was
the
language
that
succeeded
to
latin
as
the
official
mode
of
intercourse
between
nations
and
as
the
usual
means
of
talk
between
the
people
of
any
one
land
and
those
of
any
other
had
an
initial
advantage
not
quite
counterbalanced
by
the
fact
that
there
are
in
russia
myriads
of
people
who
speak
russian
and
a
few
who
can
also
read
and
write
it
russian
may
for
aught
i
know
be
a
very
beautiful
language
it
may
be
as
lucid
and
firm
in
its
constructions
as
french
is
and
as
musical
in
sound
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
it
nor
do
i
claim
for
french
that
it
was
by
its
own
virtues
predestined
to
the
primacy
that
it
holds
in
europe
had
italy
not
france
been
an
united
and
powerful
nation
when
latin
became
desuete
that
primacy
would
of
course
have
been
taken
by
italian
and
i
can
not
help
wishing
that
this
had
happened
italian
though
less
elegant
is
for
the
purpose
of
writing
a
richer
language
than
french
and
an
even
subtler
and
the
sound
of
it
spoken
is
as
superior
to
the
sound
of
french
as
a
violin
s
is
to
a
flute
s
still
french
does
by
reason
of
its
exquisite
concision
and
clarity
fill
its
post
of
honour
very
worthily
and
will
not
in
any
near
future
i
think
be
thrust
down
many
people
having
regard
to
the
very
numerous
population
of
the
british
empire
and
the
united
states
cherish
a
belief
that
english
will
presently
be
cock
of
the
world
s
walk
but
we
have
to
consider
that
english
is
an
immensely
odd
and
irregular
language
that
it
is
accounted
very
difficult
by
even
the
best
foreign
linguists
and
that
even
among
native
writers
there
are
few
who
can
so
wield
it
as
to
make
their
meaning
clear
without
prolixity
and
among
these
few
none
who
has
not
been
in
latin
by
its
very
looseness
by
its
way
of
evoking
rather
than
defining
suggesting
rather
than
saying
english
is
a
magnificent
vehicle
for
emotional
poetry
but
foreigners
don
t
much
want
to
say
beautiful
haunting
things
to
us
they
want
to
be
told
what
limits
there
are
if
any
to
the
power
of
the
lord
mayor
and
our
rambling
endeavours
to
explain
do
but
bemuse
and
annoy
them
they
find
that
the
rewards
of
learning
english
are
as
slight
as
its
difficulties
are
great
and
they
warn
their
fellows
to
this
effect
nor
does
the
oral
sound
of
english
allay
the
prejudice
thus
created
soothing
and
dear
and
charming
that
sound
is
to
english
ears
but
no
nation
can
judge
the
sound
of
its
own
language
this
can
be
judged
only
from
without
only
by
ears
to
which
it
is
unfamiliar
and
alas
much
as
we
like
listening
to
french
or
italian
for
example
italians
and
frenchmen
if
we
insist
on
having
their
opinion
will
confess
that
english
has
for
them
a
rather
harsh
sound
altogether
it
seems
to
me
unlikely
that
the
world
will
let
english
supplant
french
for
international
purposes
and
likely
that
french
will
be
ousted
only
when
the
world
shall
have
been
so
internationalised
that
the
children
of
every
land
will
have
to
learn
besides
their
own
traditional
language
some
kind
of
horrible
universal
lingo
begotten
on
volapuk
by
a
congress
of
the
world
s
worst
pedants
almost
i
could
wish
i
had
been
postponed
to
that
era
so
much
have
i
suffered
through
speaking
french
to
frenchmen
in
the
presence
of
englishmen
left
alone
with
a
frenchman
i
can
stumble
along
slowly
indeed
but
still
along
and
without
acute
sense
of
ignominy
especially
is
this
so
if
i
am
in
france
there
is
in
the
atmosphere
something
that
braces
one
for
the
language
i
don
t
say
i
am
not
sorry
even
so
for
my
frenchman
but
i
am
sorrier
for
him
in
england
and
if
any
englishmen
be
included
in
the
scene
my
sympathy
with
him
is
like
to
be
lost
in
my
agony
for
myself
would
that
i
had
made
some
such
confession
years
ago
o
folly
of
pride
i
liked
the
delusion
that
i
spoke
french
well
a
delusion
common
enough
among
those
who
had
never
heard
me
somehow
i
seemed
likely
to
possess
that
accomplishment
i
can
not
charge
myself
with
having
ever
claimed
to
possess
it
but
i
am
afraid
that
when
any
one
said
to
me
i
suppose
you
speak
french
perfectly
i
allowed
the
tone
of
my
denial
to
carry
with
it
a
hint
of
oh
no
i
would
say
my
french
is
wretched
rather
as
though
i
meant
that
a
member
of
the
french
academy
would
detect
lapses
from
pure
classicism
in
it
or
no
no
mine
is
french
pour
rire
to
imply
that
i
was
practically
bilingual
thus
during
the
years
when
i
lived
in
london
i
very
often
received
letters
from
hostesses
asking
me
to
dine
on
the
night
when
mme
chose
or
tel
was
coming
and
always
i
excused
myself
not
on
the
plea
that
i
should
be
useless
this
method
of
mine
would
have
been
well
enough
from
any
but
the
moral
standpoint
had
not
nemesis
taking
her
stand
on
that
point
sometimes
ordained
that
a
gaul
should
be
sprung
on
me
it
was
not
well
with
me
then
it
was
downfall
and
disaster
strange
how
one
will
trifle
with
even
the
most
imminent
doom
on
being
presented
to
the
gaul
i
always
hastened
to
say
that
i
spoke
his
or
her
language
only
un
tout
petit
peu
knowing
well
that
this
poor
spark
of
slang
would
kindle
within
the
breast
of
tel
or
the
bosom
of
mme
chose
hopes
that
must
so
quickly
be
quenched
in
the
puddle
of
my
incompetence
i
offer
no
excuse
for
so
foolish
a
proceeding
i
do
but
say
it
is
characteristic
of
all
who
are
duffers
at
speaking
a
foreign
tongue
great
is
the
pride
they
all
take
in
airing
some
little
bit
of
idiom
i
recall
among
many
other
pathetic
exemplifiers
of
the
foible
an
elderly
and
rather
eminent
greek
who
when
i
was
introduced
to
him
said
i
am
jolly
glad
to
meet
you
sir
and
having
said
that
had
nothing
whatever
else
to
say
and
was
moreover
unable
to
grasp
the
meaning
of
anything
said
by
me
though
i
said
the
simplest
things
and
said
them
very
slowly
and
clearly
it
is
to
my
credit
that
in
speaking
english
to
a
foreigner
i
do
always
try
to
be
helpful
i
bear
witness
against
mme
chose
and
tel
that
for
me
they
have
never
made
a
like
effort
in
their
french
it
is
said
that
french
people
do
not
really
speak
faster
than
we
and
that
their
seeming
to
do
so
is
merely
because
of
their
lighter
stress
on
syllables
if
this
is
true
i
wish
that
for
my
sake
they
would
stress
their
syllables
a
little
more
heavily
by
their
omission
of
this
kindness
i
am
so
often
baffled
as
to
their
meaning
to
be
shamed
as
a
talker
is
bad
enough
it
is
even
worse
to
be
shamed
in
the
humble
refuge
of
listener
to
listen
and
from
time
to
time
murmur
c
est
vrai
may
seem
safe
enough
yet
there
is
danger
even
here
i
wish
i
could
forget
a
certain
luncheon
in
the
course
of
which
mme
chose
that
brilliant
woman
leaned
suddenly
across
the
table
to
me
and
with
great
animation
amidst
a
general
hush
launched
at
me
a
particularly
swift
flight
of
winged
words
with
pensively
narrowed
eyes
i
uttered
my
formula
when
she
ceased
this
formula
she
repeated
in
a
tone
even
more
pensive
than
mine
mais
je
ne
le
connais
pas
she
then
loudly
exclaimed
je
ne
connais
pas
même
le
nom
de
ce
jeune
she
had
as
it
presently
turned
out
been
asking
me
which
of
the
younger
french
novelists
was
most
highly
thought
of
by
english
critics
so
that
her
surprise
at
never
having
heard
of
the
gifted
young
sevre
was
natural
enough
we
all
but
no
i
must
not
say
that
we
all
have
painful
memories
of
this
kind
some
of
us
can
understand
every
word
that
flies
from
the
lips
of
mme
chose
or
from
the
mouth
of
tel
some
of
us
can
also
talk
quickly
and
well
to
either
of
these
pilgrims
and
others
can
do
the
trick
passably
but
the
duffers
are
in
a
great
grim
majority
and
the
mischief
that
french
causes
among
us
is
mainly
manifest
not
i
would
say
by
weaker
brethren
hating
the
stronger
but
by
weak
ones
hating
the
less
weak
as
french
is
a
subject
on
which
we
all
feel
so
keenly
a
point
of
honour
on
which
we
are
all
so
sensitive
how
comes
it
that
our
general
achievement
is
so
slight
there
was
no
lack
of
hopes
of
plans
that
we
should
excel
in
many
cases
time
was
taken
for
us
by
the
forelock
and
a
french
nurse
installed
but
alas
little
children
are
wax
to
receive
and
to
retain
they
will
be
charmingly
fluent
speakers
of
french
within
six
weeks
of
mariette
s
arrival
and
will
have
forgotten
every
word
of
it
within
as
brief
an
interval
after
her
departure
later
their
minds
become
more
retentive
though
less
absorbent
and
then
by
all
means
let
french
be
taught
taught
it
is
at
the
school
where
i
was
reared
there
were
four
french
masters
four
but
to
what
purpose
their
were
scenes
of
eternal
and
incredible
pandemonium
filled
with
whoops
and
catcalls
with
devil
on
desks
and
shrill
inquiries
for
the
exact
date
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
nor
was
the
lot
of
those
four
men
exceptional
in
its
horror
from
the
accounts
given
to
me
by
old
boys
of
other
schools
i
have
gathered
that
it
was
the
common
lot
of
french
masters
on
our
shores
and
i
have
often
wondered
how
much
of
the
anglophobia
recurrent
among
frenchmen
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
due
to
the
tragic
tales
told
by
those
of
them
who
had
returned
from
our
seminaries
to
die
on
their
own
soil
since
doubtless
french
masters
have
had
a
very
good
time
in
england
but
even
so
i
doubt
whether
they
have
been
achieving
much
in
the
way
of
tutelage
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
a
boy
will
profit
but
little
by
three
or
four
lessons
a
week
which
are
the
utmost
that
our
system
allows
him
what
he
wants
or
at
any
rate
will
want
is
to
be
able
to
cope
with
mme
chose
a
smattering
of
the
irregular
verbs
will
not
much
avail
him
in
that
emprise
not
in
the
dark
of
conjugation
but
on
the
sunny
field
of
frank
social
intercourse
must
he
prove
his
knighthood
i
would
recommend
that
every
boy
on
reaching
the
age
of
sixteen
should
be
hurled
across
the
channel
into
the
midst
of
some
french
family
and
kept
there
for
six
months
at
the
end
of
that
time
let
him
be
returned
to
his
school
there
to
make
up
for
lost
time
time
well
lost
though
for
the
boy
will
have
become
fluent
in
french
and
will
ever
remain
so
fluency
is
all
if
the
boy
has
a
good
ear
he
will
speak
with
a
good
accent
but
his
accent
is
a
point
about
which
really
he
needn
t
care
a
jot
so
is
his
syntax
not
with
these
will
he
win
the
heart
of
mme
chose
not
with
these
the
esteem
of
tel
not
with
these
anything
but
a
more
acrid
rancour
in
the
silly
hostility
of
his
competitors
if
a
foreigner
speaks
english
to
us
easily
and
quickly
we
demand
no
more
of
him
we
are
satisfied
we
are
delighted
and
any
mistakes
of
grammar
or
pronunciation
do
but
increase
the
charm
investing
with
more
than
its
intrinsic
quality
any
good
thing
said
making
us
marvel
at
it
and
exchange
fatuous
glances
over
it
as
we
do
when
a
little
child
says
something
sensible
but
heaven
protect
us
from
the
foreigner
who
pauses
searches
fumbles
revises
comes
to
standstills
has
recourse
to
away
with
him
by
the
first
train
to
dover
and
this
we
may
be
sure
is
the
very
train
tel
and
mme
chose
would
like
to
catch
whenever
they
meet
me
or
you
laughter
bergson
in
his
essay
on
this
theme
says
well
he
says
many
things
but
none
of
these
though
i
have
just
read
them
do
i
clearly
remember
nor
am
i
sure
that
in
the
act
of
reading
i
understood
any
of
them
that
is
the
worst
of
these
fashionable
philosophers
or
rather
the
worst
of
me
somehow
i
never
manage
to
read
them
till
they
are
just
going
out
of
fashion
and
even
then
i
don
t
seem
able
to
cope
with
them
about
twelve
years
ago
when
every
one
suddenly
talked
to
me
about
pragmatism
and
william
james
i
found
myself
moved
by
a
dull
but
irresistible
impulse
to
try
schopenhauer
of
whom
years
before
that
i
had
heard
that
he
was
the
easiest
reading
in
the
world
and
the
most
exciting
and
amusing
i
wrestled
with
schopenhauer
for
a
day
or
so
in
vain
time
passed
bergson
appeared
and
for
his
hour
was
lord
of
the
ascendant
i
tardily
tackled
william
james
i
bore
in
mind
as
i
approached
him
the
testimonials
that
had
been
lavished
on
him
by
all
my
friends
alas
i
was
insensible
to
his
thrillingness
his
gaiety
did
not
make
me
gay
his
crystal
clarity
confused
me
dreadfully
i
could
make
nothing
of
william
james
and
now
in
the
fullness
of
time
i
have
been
floored
by
bergson
it
distresses
me
this
failure
to
keep
pace
with
the
leaders
of
thought
as
they
pass
into
oblivion
it
makes
me
wonder
whether
i
am
after
all
an
absolute
fool
yet
surely
i
am
not
that
tell
me
of
a
man
or
a
woman
a
place
or
an
event
real
or
fictitious
surely
you
will
find
me
a
fairly
intelligent
listener
any
such
narrative
will
present
to
me
some
image
and
will
stir
me
to
not
altogether
fatuous
thoughts
come
to
me
in
some
grievous
difficulty
i
will
talk
to
you
like
a
father
even
like
a
lawyer
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
haven
t
a
certain
mellow
wisdom
but
if
you
are
by
way
of
weaving
theories
as
to
the
nature
of
things
in
general
and
if
you
want
to
try
those
theories
on
some
one
who
will
luminously
confirm
them
or
powerfully
rend
them
i
must
with
a
air
warn
you
that
i
am
not
your
man
i
suffer
from
a
strong
suspicion
that
things
in
general
can
not
be
accounted
for
through
any
formula
or
set
of
formulae
and
that
any
one
philosophy
howsoever
new
is
no
better
than
another
that
is
in
itself
a
sort
of
philosophy
and
i
suspect
it
accordingly
but
it
has
for
me
the
merit
of
being
the
only
one
i
can
make
head
or
tail
of
if
you
try
to
expound
any
other
philosophic
system
to
me
you
will
find
not
merely
that
i
can
detect
no
flaw
in
it
except
the
one
great
flaw
just
suggested
but
also
that
i
haven
t
after
a
minute
or
two
the
vaguest
notion
of
what
you
are
driving
at
very
well
you
say
instead
of
trying
to
explain
all
things
all
at
once
i
will
explain
some
little
simple
single
it
was
for
sake
of
such
shorn
lambs
as
myself
doubtless
that
bergson
sat
down
and
wrote
about
laughter
but
i
have
profited
by
his
kindness
no
more
than
if
he
had
been
treating
of
the
cosmos
i
can
not
tread
even
a
limited
space
of
air
i
have
a
gross
satisfaction
in
the
crude
fact
of
being
on
hard
ground
again
and
i
utter
a
coarse
peal
of
laughter
at
least
i
say
i
do
so
in
point
of
fact
i
have
merely
smiled
twenty
years
ago
ten
years
ago
i
should
have
laughed
and
have
professed
to
you
that
i
had
merely
smiled
a
very
young
man
is
not
content
to
be
very
young
nor
even
a
young
man
to
be
young
he
wants
to
share
the
dignity
of
his
elders
there
is
no
dignity
in
laughter
there
is
much
of
it
in
smiles
laughter
is
but
a
joyous
surrender
smiles
give
token
of
mature
criticism
it
may
be
that
in
the
early
ages
of
this
world
there
was
far
more
laughter
than
is
to
be
heard
now
and
that
aeons
hence
laughter
will
be
obsolete
and
smiles
universal
every
one
always
mildly
slightly
smiling
but
it
is
less
useful
to
speculate
as
to
mankind
s
past
and
future
than
to
observe
men
and
you
will
have
observed
with
me
in
the
that
young
men
at
most
times
look
solemn
whereas
old
men
or
men
of
middle
age
mostly
smile
and
also
that
those
young
men
do
often
laugh
loud
and
long
among
themselves
while
we
others
the
gayest
and
best
of
us
in
the
most
favourable
circumstances
seldom
achieve
more
than
our
habitual
act
of
smiling
does
the
sound
of
that
laughter
jar
on
us
do
we
liken
it
to
the
crackling
of
thorns
under
a
pot
let
us
do
so
there
is
no
cheerier
sound
but
let
us
not
assume
it
to
be
the
laughter
of
fools
because
we
sit
quiet
it
is
absurd
to
disapprove
of
what
one
envies
or
to
wish
a
good
thing
were
no
more
because
it
has
passed
out
of
our
possession
but
it
seems
that
i
must
begin
every
paragraph
by
questioning
the
sincerity
of
what
i
have
just
said
has
the
gift
of
laughter
been
withdrawn
from
me
i
protest
that
i
do
still
at
the
age
of
laugh
often
and
loud
and
long
but
not
i
believe
so
long
and
loud
and
often
as
in
my
less
smiling
youth
and
i
am
proud
nowadays
of
laughing
and
grateful
to
any
one
who
makes
me
laugh
that
is
a
bad
sign
i
no
longer
take
laughter
as
a
matter
of
course
i
realise
even
after
reading
bergson
on
it
how
good
a
thing
it
is
i
am
qualified
to
praise
it
as
to
what
is
most
precious
among
the
accessories
to
the
world
we
live
in
different
men
hold
different
opinions
there
are
people
whom
the
sea
depresses
whom
mountains
exhilarate
personally
i
want
the
sea
always
some
not
populous
edge
of
it
for
choice
and
with
it
sunshine
and
wine
and
a
little
music
my
friend
on
the
mountain
yonder
is
of
tougher
fibre
and
sterner
outlook
disapproves
of
the
sea
s
laxity
and
instability
has
no
ear
for
music
and
no
palate
for
the
grape
and
regards
the
sun
as
a
rather
enervating
institution
like
central
heating
in
a
house
what
he
likes
is
a
grey
day
and
the
wind
in
his
face
crags
at
a
great
altitude
and
a
flask
of
whisky
yet
i
think
that
even
he
if
we
were
trying
to
determine
from
what
inner
sources
mankind
derives
the
greatest
pleasure
in
life
would
agree
with
me
that
only
the
emotion
of
love
takes
higher
rank
than
the
emotion
of
laughter
both
these
emotions
are
partly
mental
partly
physical
it
is
said
that
the
mental
symptoms
of
love
are
wholly
physical
in
origin
they
are
not
the
less
ethereal
for
that
the
physical
sensations
of
laughter
on
the
other
hand
are
reached
by
a
process
whose
is
in
the
mind
they
are
not
the
less
gloriously
of
our
there
is
laughter
that
goes
so
far
as
to
lose
all
touch
with
its
motive
and
to
exist
only
grossly
in
itself
this
is
laughter
at
its
best
a
man
to
whom
such
laughter
has
often
been
granted
may
happen
to
die
in
a
no
matter
i
will
not
admit
that
he
has
failed
in
life
another
man
who
has
never
laughed
thus
may
be
buried
in
westminster
abbey
leaving
more
than
a
million
pounds
overhead
what
then
i
regard
him
as
a
failure
nor
does
it
seem
to
me
to
matter
one
jot
how
such
laughter
is
achieved
humour
may
rollick
on
high
planes
of
fantasy
or
in
depths
of
silliness
to
many
people
it
appeals
only
from
those
depths
if
it
appeal
to
them
irresistibly
they
are
more
enviable
than
those
who
are
sensitive
only
to
the
finer
kind
of
joke
and
not
so
sensitive
as
to
be
mastered
and
dissolved
by
it
laughter
is
a
thing
to
be
rated
according
to
its
own
intensity
many
years
ago
i
wrote
an
essay
in
which
i
poured
scorn
on
the
fun
purveyed
by
the
music
halls
and
on
the
great
public
for
which
that
fun
was
quite
good
enough
i
take
that
callow
scorn
back
i
fancy
that
the
fun
itself
was
better
than
it
seemed
to
me
and
might
not
have
displeased
me
if
it
had
been
wafted
to
me
in
private
in
presence
of
a
few
friends
a
public
crowd
because
of
a
lack
of
broad
impersonal
humanity
in
me
rather
insulates
than
absorbs
me
amidst
the
guffaws
of
a
thousand
strangers
i
become
unnaturally
grave
if
these
people
were
the
entertainment
and
i
the
audience
i
should
be
sympathetic
enough
but
to
be
one
of
them
is
a
position
that
drives
me
spiritually
aloof
also
there
is
to
me
something
rather
dreary
in
the
notion
of
going
anywhere
for
the
specific
purpose
of
being
amused
i
prefer
that
laughter
shall
take
me
unawares
only
so
can
it
master
and
dissolve
me
and
in
this
respect
at
any
rate
i
am
not
peculiar
in
music
halls
and
such
places
you
may
hear
loud
laughter
but
not
see
silent
laughter
not
see
strong
men
weak
helpless
suffering
gradually
convalescent
dangerously
relapsing
laughter
at
its
greatest
and
best
is
not
there
to
such
laughter
nothing
is
more
propitious
than
an
occasion
that
demands
gravity
to
have
good
reason
for
not
laughing
is
one
of
the
surest
aids
laughter
rejoices
in
bonds
if
music
halls
were
schoolrooms
for
us
and
the
comedians
were
our
schoolmasters
how
much
less
talent
would
be
needed
for
giving
us
how
much
more
joy
even
in
private
and
accidental
intercourse
few
are
the
men
whose
humour
can
reduce
us
be
we
never
so
susceptible
to
paroxysms
of
mirth
i
will
wager
that
nine
tenths
of
the
world
s
best
laughter
is
laughter
at
not
with
and
it
is
the
people
set
in
authority
over
us
that
touch
most
surely
our
sense
of
the
ridiculous
freedom
is
a
good
thing
but
we
lose
through
it
golden
moments
the
schoolmaster
to
his
pupils
the
monarch
to
his
courtiers
the
editor
to
his
staff
how
priceless
they
are
reverence
is
a
good
thing
and
part
of
its
value
is
that
the
more
we
revere
a
man
the
more
sharply
are
we
struck
by
anything
in
him
and
there
is
always
much
that
is
incongruous
with
his
greatness
and
herein
lies
one
of
the
reasons
why
as
we
grow
older
we
laugh
less
the
men
we
esteemed
so
great
are
gathered
to
their
fathers
some
of
our
coevals
may
for
aught
we
know
be
very
great
but
good
heavens
we
can
t
esteem
them
so
of
extreme
laughter
i
know
not
in
any
annals
a
more
satisfying
example
than
one
that
is
to
be
found
in
moore
s
life
of
byron
both
byron
and
moore
were
already
in
high
spirits
when
on
an
evening
in
the
spring
of
they
went
from
some
early
assembly
to
rogers
house
in
james
s
place
and
were
regaled
there
with
an
impromptu
meal
but
not
high
spirits
alone
would
have
led
the
two
young
poets
to
such
excess
of
laughter
as
made
the
evening
so
very
memorable
luckily
they
both
venerated
rogers
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
us
as
the
greatest
of
living
poets
luckily
too
rogers
was
ever
the
kind
of
man
the
coldly
and
quietly
suave
kind
of
man
with
whom
you
don
t
take
liberties
if
you
can
help
it
with
whom
if
you
can
t
help
it
to
take
liberties
is
in
itself
a
most
exhilarating
act
and
he
had
just
received
a
presentation
copy
of
lord
thurloe
s
latest
book
poems
on
several
the
two
young
poets
found
in
this
elder
s
muse
much
that
was
so
execrable
as
to
be
delightful
they
were
soon
as
they
turned
the
pages
held
in
throes
of
laughter
laughter
that
was
but
intensified
by
the
endeavours
of
their
correct
and
nettled
host
to
point
out
the
genuine
merits
of
his
friend
s
work
and
then
suddenly
oh
joy
we
lighted
moore
records
on
the
discovery
that
our
host
in
addition
to
his
sincere
approbation
of
some
of
this
book
s
contents
had
also
the
motive
of
gratitude
for
standing
by
its
author
as
one
of
the
poems
was
a
warm
and
i
need
not
add
panegyric
on
himself
we
were
however
the
narrative
has
an
added
charm
from
tom
moore
s
demure
care
not
to
offend
or
compromise
the
rogers
too
far
gone
in
nonsense
for
even
this
eulogy
in
which
we
both
so
heartily
agreed
to
stop
us
the
opening
line
of
the
poem
was
as
well
as
i
can
recollect
when
rogers
o
er
this
labour
bent
and
lord
byron
undertook
to
read
it
aloud
but
he
found
it
impossible
to
get
beyond
the
first
two
words
our
laughter
had
now
increased
to
such
a
pitch
that
nothing
could
restrain
it
two
or
three
times
he
began
but
no
sooner
had
the
words
when
rogers
passed
his
lips
than
our
fit
burst
out
afresh
till
even
rogers
himself
with
all
his
feeling
of
our
injustice
found
it
impossible
not
to
join
us
and
we
were
at
last
all
three
in
such
a
state
of
inextinguishable
laughter
that
had
the
author
himself
been
of
our
party
i
question
much
whether
he
could
have
resisted
the
the
final
fall
and
dissolution
of
rogers
rogers
behaving
as
badly
as
either
of
them
is
all
that
was
needed
to
give
perfection
to
this
scene
i
like
to
think
that
on
a
certain
night
in
spring
year
after
year
three
ghosts
revisit
that
old
room
and
without
i
hope
inconvenience
to
lord
northcliffe
who
may
happen
to
be
there
sit
rocking
and
writhing
in
the
grip
of
that
old
shared
rapture
uncanny
well
not
more
so
than
would
have
seemed
to
byron
and
moore
and
rogers
the
notion
that
more
than
a
hundred
years
away
from
them
was
some
one
joining
in
their
laughter
as
i
do
alas
i
can
not
join
in
it
more
than
gently
to
imagine
a
scene
however
vividly
does
not
give
us
the
sense
of
being
or
even
of
having
been
present
at
it
indeed
the
greater
the
glow
of
the
scene
reflected
the
sharper
is
the
pang
of
our
realisation
that
we
were
not
there
and
of
our
annoyance
that
we
weren
t
such
a
pang
comes
to
me
with
special
force
whenever
my
fancy
posts
itself
outside
the
temple
s
gate
in
fleet
street
and
there
at
a
late
hour
of
the
night
of
may
observes
a
gigantic
old
man
laughing
wildly
but
having
no
one
with
him
to
share
and
aggrandise
his
emotion
not
that
he
is
alone
but
the
young
man
beside
him
laughs
only
in
politeness
and
is
inwardly
puzzled
even
shocked
boswell
has
a
keen
an
exquisitely
keen
scent
for
comedy
for
the
fun
that
is
latent
in
fine
shades
of
character
but
imaginative
burlesque
anything
that
borders
on
lovely
nonsense
he
was
not
formed
to
savour
all
the
more
does
one
revel
in
his
account
of
what
led
up
to
the
moment
when
johnson
to
support
himself
laid
hold
of
one
of
the
posts
at
the
side
of
the
foot
pavement
and
sent
forth
peals
so
loud
that
in
the
silence
of
the
night
his
voice
seemed
to
resound
from
temple
bar
to
fleet
no
evening
ever
had
an
unlikelier
ending
the
omens
were
all
for
gloom
johnson
had
gone
to
dine
at
general
paoli
s
but
was
so
ill
that
he
had
to
leave
before
the
meal
was
over
later
he
managed
to
go
to
chambers
rooms
in
the
temple
he
continued
to
be
very
ill
there
but
gradually
felt
better
and
talked
with
a
noble
enthusiasm
of
keeping
up
the
representation
of
respectable
families
and
was
great
on
the
dignity
and
propriety
of
male
among
his
listeners
as
it
happened
was
a
gentleman
for
whom
mr
chambers
had
that
day
drawn
up
a
will
devising
his
estate
to
his
three
sisters
the
news
of
this
might
have
been
expected
to
make
johnson
violent
in
wrath
but
no
for
some
reason
he
grew
violent
only
in
laughter
and
insisted
thenceforth
on
calling
that
gentleman
the
testator
and
chaffing
him
without
mercy
i
daresay
he
thinks
he
has
done
a
mighty
thing
he
won
t
stay
till
he
gets
home
to
his
seat
in
the
country
to
produce
this
wonderful
deed
he
ll
call
up
the
landlord
of
the
first
inn
on
the
road
and
after
a
suitable
preface
upon
mortality
and
the
uncertainty
of
life
will
tell
him
that
he
should
not
delay
in
making
his
will
and
here
sir
will
he
say
is
my
will
which
i
have
just
made
with
the
assistance
of
one
of
the
ablest
lawyers
in
the
kingdom
and
he
will
read
it
to
him
he
believes
he
has
made
this
will
but
he
did
not
make
it
you
chambers
made
it
for
him
i
hope
you
have
had
more
conscience
than
to
make
him
say
being
of
sound
understanding
ha
ha
ha
i
hope
he
has
left
me
a
legacy
i
d
have
his
will
turned
into
verse
like
a
these
flights
annoyed
mr
chambers
and
are
recorded
by
boswell
with
the
apology
that
he
wishes
his
readers
to
be
acquainted
with
the
slightest
occasional
characteristics
of
so
eminent
a
certainly
there
is
nothing
ridiculous
in
the
fact
of
a
man
making
a
will
but
this
is
the
measure
of
johnson
s
achievement
he
had
created
gloriously
much
out
of
nothing
at
all
there
he
sat
old
and
ailing
and
unencouraged
by
the
company
but
soaring
higher
and
higher
in
absurdity
more
and
more
rejoicing
and
still
soaring
and
rejoicing
after
he
had
gone
out
into
the
night
with
boswell
till
at
last
in
fleet
street
his
paroxysms
were
too
much
for
him
and
he
could
no
more
echoes
of
that
huge
laughter
come
ringing
down
the
ages
but
is
there
also
perhaps
a
note
of
sadness
for
us
in
them
johnson
s
endless
sociability
came
of
his
inherent
melancholy
he
could
not
bear
to
be
alone
and
his
very
mirth
was
but
a
mode
of
escape
from
the
dark
thoughts
within
him
of
these
the
thought
of
death
was
the
most
dreadful
to
him
and
the
most
insistent
he
was
for
ever
wondering
how
death
would
come
to
him
and
how
he
would
acquit
himself
in
the
extreme
moment
a
later
but
not
less
devoted
anglican
meditating
on
his
own
end
wrote
in
his
diary
that
to
die
in
church
appears
to
be
a
great
euthanasia
but
not
he
quaintly
and
touchingly
added
at
a
time
to
disturb
both
the
sentiment
here
expressed
and
the
reservation
drawn
would
have
been
as
characteristic
of
johnson
as
they
were
of
gladstone
but
to
die
of
laughter
this
too
seems
to
me
a
great
euthanasia
and
i
think
that
for
johnson
to
have
died
thus
that
night
in
fleet
street
would
have
been
a
grand
ending
to
a
life
radically
well
he
was
destined
to
outlive
another
decade
and
selfishly
who
can
wish
such
a
life
as
his
or
such
a
life
as
boswell
s
one
jot
shorter
strange
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
that
of
all
the
countless
folk
who
have
lived
before
our
time
on
this
planet
not
one
is
known
in
history
or
in
legend
as
having
died
of
laughter
strange
too
that
not
to
one
of
all
the
characters
in
romance
has
such
an
end
been
allotted
has
it
ever
struck
you
what
a
chance
shakespeare
missed
when
he
was
finishing
the
second
part
of
king
henry
the
fourth
falstaff
was
not
the
man
to
stand
cowed
and
bowed
while
the
new
young
king
lectured
him
and
cast
him
off
little
by
little
as
hal
proceeded
in
that
portentous
allocution
the
humour
of
the
situation
would
have
mastered
old
sir
john
his
face
blank
with
surprise
at
first
would
presently
have
glowed
and
widened
and
his
whole
bulk
have
begun
to
quiver
lest
he
should
miss
one
word
he
would
have
mastered
himself
but
the
final
words
would
have
been
the
signal
for
release
of
all
the
roars
pent
up
in
him
the
welkin
would
have
rung
the
roars
belike
would
have
gradually
subsided
in
dreadful
rumblings
of
more
than
utterable
or
conquerable
mirth
thus
and
thus
only
might
his
life
have
been
rounded
off
with
dramatic
fitness
secundum
ipsius
naturam
he
never
should
have
been
left
to
babble
of
green
fields
and
die
an
it
had
been
any
christom
falstaff
is
a
triumph
of
comedic
creation
because
we
are
kept
laughing
equally
at
and
with
him
nevertheless
if
i
had
the
choice
of
sitting
with
him
at
the
boar
s
head
or
with
johnson
at
the
turk
s
i
shouldn
t
hesitate
for
an
instant
the
agility
of
falstaff
s
mind
gains
much
of
its
effect
by
contrast
with
the
massiveness
of
his
body
but
in
contrast
with
johnson
s
equal
agility
is
johnson
s
moral
as
well
as
physical
bulk
his
sallies
tell
the
more
startlingly
because
of
the
noble
weight
of
character
behind
them
they
are
the
better
because
he
makes
them
in
falstaff
there
isn
t
this
final
incongruity
and
element
of
surprise
falstaff
is
but
a
sublimated
sample
of
the
funny
we
can
not
therefore
laugh
so
greatly
with
him
as
with
johnson
nor
even
at
him
because
we
are
not
tickled
so
much
by
the
weak
points
of
a
character
whose
points
are
all
weak
ones
also
because
we
have
no
reverence
trying
to
impose
restraint
upon
us
still
falstaff
has
indubitably
the
power
to
convulse
us
i
don
t
mean
we
ever
are
convulsed
in
reading
henry
the
fourth
no
printed
page
alas
can
thrill
us
to
extremities
of
laughter
these
are
ours
only
if
the
mirthmaker
be
a
living
man
whose
jests
we
hear
as
they
come
fresh
from
his
own
lips
all
i
claim
for
falstaff
is
that
he
would
be
able
to
convulse
us
if
he
were
alive
and
accessible
few
as
i
have
said
are
the
humorists
who
can
induce
this
state
to
master
and
dissolve
us
to
give
us
the
joy
of
being
worn
down
and
tired
out
with
laughter
is
a
success
to
be
won
by
no
man
save
in
virtue
of
a
rare
laughter
becomes
extreme
only
if
it
be
consecutive
there
must
be
no
pauses
for
recovery
humour
however
happy
is
not
enough
the
jester
must
be
able
to
grapple
his
theme
and
hang
on
to
it
twisting
it
this
way
and
that
and
making
it
yield
magically
all
manner
of
strange
and
precious
things
one
after
another
without
pause
he
must
have
invention
keeping
pace
with
utterance
he
must
be
inexhaustible
only
so
can
he
exhaust
us
i
have
a
friend
whom
i
would
praise
there
are
many
other
of
my
friends
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
much
laughter
but
i
do
believe
that
if
all
of
them
sent
in
their
bills
and
all
of
them
overcharged
me
not
a
little
the
total
of
all
those
totals
would
be
less
appalling
than
that
which
looms
in
my
own
vague
estimate
of
what
i
owe
to
comus
comus
i
call
him
here
in
observance
of
the
line
drawn
between
public
and
private
virtue
and
in
full
knowledge
that
he
would
of
all
men
be
the
least
glad
to
be
quite
personally
thanked
and
laurelled
in
the
for
the
hours
he
has
made
memorable
among
his
cronies
no
one
is
so
diffident
as
he
no
one
so
many
people
have
met
him
again
and
again
without
faintly
suspecting
anything
much
in
him
many
of
his
acquaintances
friends
too
relatives
even
have
lived
and
died
in
the
belief
that
he
was
quite
ordinary
thus
is
he
the
more
greatly
valued
by
his
cronies
thus
do
we
pride
ourselves
on
possessing
some
curious
right
quality
to
which
alone
he
is
responsive
but
it
would
seem
that
either
this
asset
of
ours
or
its
effect
on
him
is
intermittent
he
can
be
dull
and
null
enough
with
us
sometimes
a
mere
asker
of
questions
or
drawer
of
comparisons
between
this
and
that
brand
of
cigarettes
or
full
expatiator
on
the
merits
of
some
new
patent
razor
a
whole
hour
and
more
may
be
wasted
in
such
humdrum
and
darkness
and
then
something
will
have
happened
there
has
come
a
spark
in
the
murk
a
flame
now
presage
of
a
radiance
comus
has
begun
his
face
is
a
great
part
of
his
equipment
a
cast
of
it
might
be
somewhat
akin
to
the
comic
mask
of
the
ancients
but
no
cast
could
be
worthy
of
it
mobility
is
the
essence
of
it
it
flickers
and
shifts
in
accord
to
the
matter
of
his
discourse
it
contracts
and
it
expands
is
there
anything
its
elastic
can
t
express
comus
would
be
eloquent
even
were
he
dumb
and
he
is
mellifluous
his
voice
while
he
develops
an
idea
or
conjures
up
a
scene
takes
on
a
peculiar
richness
and
unction
if
he
be
describing
an
actual
scene
voice
and
face
are
adaptable
to
those
of
the
actual
persons
therein
but
it
is
not
in
such
mimicry
that
he
excels
as
a
reporter
he
has
rivals
for
the
most
part
he
moves
on
a
higher
plane
that
of
mere
fact
he
imagines
he
creates
giving
you
not
a
person
but
a
type
a
synthesis
and
not
what
anywhere
has
been
but
what
anywhere
might
be
what
as
one
feels
for
all
the
absurdity
of
it
just
would
be
he
knows
his
world
well
and
nothing
human
is
alien
to
him
but
certain
skeins
of
life
have
a
special
hold
on
him
and
he
on
them
in
his
youth
he
wished
to
be
a
clergyman
and
over
the
clergy
of
all
grades
and
denominations
his
genius
hovers
and
swoops
and
ranges
with
a
special
mastery
lawyers
he
loves
less
yet
the
legal
mind
seems
to
lie
almost
as
to
him
as
the
sacerdotal
and
the
legal
manner
in
all
its
phases
he
can
unerringly
burlesque
in
the
minds
of
journalists
diverse
journalists
he
is
not
less
thoroughly
at
home
so
that
of
the
wild
contingencies
imagined
by
him
there
is
none
about
which
he
can
not
reel
off
an
oral
leader
or
middle
in
the
likeliest
style
and
with
as
much
ease
as
he
can
preach
a
high
church
or
low
church
sermon
on
it
nor
are
his
improvisations
limited
by
prose
if
a
theme
call
for
nobler
treatment
he
becomes
an
unflagging
fountain
of
ludicrously
adequate
or
again
he
may
deliver
himself
in
rhyme
there
is
no
form
of
utterance
that
comes
amiss
to
him
for
interpreting
the
human
comedy
or
for
broadening
the
farce
into
which
that
comedy
is
turned
by
him
nothing
can
stop
him
when
once
he
is
in
the
vein
no
appeals
move
him
he
goes
from
strength
to
strength
while
his
audience
is
more
and
more
piteously
debilitated
what
a
gift
to
have
been
endowed
with
what
a
power
to
wield
and
how
often
i
have
envied
comus
but
this
envy
of
him
has
never
taken
root
in
me
his
mind
laughs
doubtless
at
his
own
conceptions
but
not
his
body
and
if
you
tell
him
something
that
you
have
been
sure
will
convulse
him
you
are
likely
to
be
rewarded
with
no
more
than
a
smile
betokening
that
he
sees
the
point
incomparable
he
is
not
much
a
laugher
he
is
vintner
not
toper
i
would
therefore
not
change
places
with
him
i
am
well
content
to
have
been
his
beneficiary
during
thirty
years
and
to
be
so
for
as
many
more
as
may
be
given
us
