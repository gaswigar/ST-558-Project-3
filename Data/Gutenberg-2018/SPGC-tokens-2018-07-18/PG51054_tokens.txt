is
to
be
associated
in
conception
with
the
group
of
romances
which
dumas
wrote
at
brussels
between
the
years
and
that
is
to
say
after
his
financial
failure
and
the
consequent
defection
of
his
collaborator
maquet
and
before
his
return
to
paris
to
found
his
journal
like
l
and
which
date
from
that
period
of
exile
the
present
story
was
inspired
by
reminiscences
of
our
author
s
native
place
in
the
department
of
the
aisne
in
dumas
however
allows
his
imagination
and
fancy
full
play
using
a
legend
told
to
him
nearly
half
a
century
before
conjuring
up
the
scenes
of
his
boyhood
and
calling
into
requisition
his
wonderful
gift
of
improvisation
he
contrives
in
the
happiest
way
to
weave
a
romance
in
which
are
combined
a
weird
tale
of
and
continual
delightful
glimpses
of
forest
life
terror
and
humour
could
not
be
more
felicitously
intermingled
the
reader
while
kept
under
the
spell
of
the
main
theme
of
the
story
experiences
all
the
charm
of
an
life
in
the
great
forest
of
the
forest
in
which
the
little
town
seemed
to
occupy
a
small
clearing
and
into
which
the
boy
alexandre
occasionally
escaped
for
days
together
from
the
irksome
routine
of
the
school
or
from
the
hands
of
relatives
who
wanted
to
make
a
priest
of
him
thus
dumas
the
most
impressionable
of
men
all
his
life
remained
grateful
to
the
forest
for
the
poetic
fancies
derived
from
its
beauty
and
the
mysteries
of
its
recesses
as
well
as
for
the
it
afforded
him
and
for
the
game
and
birds
which
he
soon
learnt
to
shoot
and
snare
there
listen
to
his
indignation
at
the
destruction
of
the
trees
in
the
neighbouring
park
we
quote
from

you
had
a
right
to
believe
that
a

would
have

you
that

the
life

sole

would
have
preserved
you
for

as
i
am
there
is
one
thing
that
i
would
set
before
all
the
gold
of
the
earth
and
that
is
the
murmur
of
the
wind
in
your
leaves
the
shadow
that
you
made
to
flicker
beneath
my
feet
the
sweet
visions
the
charming
phantoms
which
at
evening
time
betwixt
the
day
and
night
in
twilight
s
doubtful
hour
would
glide
between
your
trunks

glide

shadows

cadot
dumas
reprinted
it
in
his
journal
in
the
introduction
who
mocquet
was
and
how
this
tale
became
known
to
the
narrator
i
why
i
ask
myself
during
those
first
twenty
years
of
my
literary
life
from
to
did
i
so
rarely
turn
my
eyes
and
thoughts
towards
the
little
town
where
i
was
born
towards
the
woods
amid
which
it
lies
embowered
and
the
villages
that
cluster
round
it
how
was
it
that
during
all
that
time
the
world
of
my
youth
seemed
to
me
to
have
disappeared
as
if
hidden
behind
a
cloud
whilst
the
future
which
lay
before
me
shone
clear
and
resplendent
like
those
magic
islands
which
columbus
and
his
companions
mistook
for
baskets
of
flowers
floating
on
the
sea
alas
simply
because
during
the
first
twenty
years
of
our
life
we
have
hope
for
our
guide
and
during
the
last
twenty
reality
from
the
hour
when
weary
with
our
journey
we
ungird
ourselves
and
dropping
the
traveller
s
staff
sit
down
by
the
we
begin
to
look
back
over
the
road
that
we
have
traversed
for
it
is
the
way
ahead
that
now
is
dark
and
misty
and
so
we
turn
and
gaze
into
the
depths
of
the
past
then
with
the
wide
desert
awaiting
us
in
front
we
are
astonished
as
we
look
along
the
path
which
we
have
left
behind
to
catch
sight
of
first
one
and
then
another
of
those
delicious
oases
of
verdure
and
shade
beside
which
we
never
thought
of
lingering
for
a
moment
and
which
indeed
we
had
passed
by
almost
without
notice
but
then
how
quickly
our
feet
carried
us
along
in
those
days
we
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
reach
that
goal
of
happiness
to
which
no
road
has
ever
yet
brought
any
one
of
us
it
is
at
this
point
that
we
begin
to
see
how
blind
and
ungrateful
we
have
been
it
is
now
that
we
say
to
ourselves
if
we
could
but
once
more
come
across
such
a
green
and
wooded
we
would
stay
there
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
would
pitch
our
tent
there
and
there
end
our
days
but
the
body
can
not
go
back
and
renew
its
existence
and
so
memory
has
to
make
its
pious
pilgrimage
alone
back
to
the
early
days
and
fresh
beginnings
of
life
it
travels
like
those
light
vessels
that
are
borne
upward
by
their
white
sails
against
the
current
of
a
river
then
the
body
once
more
pursues
its
journey
but
the
body
without
memory
is
as
the
night
without
stars
as
the
lamp
without
its
flame
and
so
body
and
memory
go
their
several
ways
the
body
with
chance
for
its
guide
moves
towards
the
unknown
memory
that
bright
hovers
over
the
that
are
left
behind
and
memory
we
may
be
sure
will
not
lose
her
way
every
oasis
is
revisited
every
association
recalled
and
then
with
a
rapid
flight
she
returns
to
the
body
that
grows
ever
more
and
more
weary
and
like
the
humming
of
a
bee
like
the
song
of
a
bird
like
the
murmur
of
a
stream
tells
the
tale
of
all
that
she
has
seen
and
as
the
tired
traveller
listens
his
eyes
grow
bright
again
his
mouth
smiles
and
a
light
steals
over
his
face
for
providence
in
kindness
seeing
that
he
can
not
return
to
youth
allows
youth
to
return
to
him
and
ever
after
he
loves
to
repeat
aloud
what
memory
tells
him
in
her
soft
low
voice
and
is
our
life
then
bounded
by
a
circle
like
the
earth
do
we
unconsciously
continue
to
walk
towards
the
spot
from
which
we
started
and
as
we
travel
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
grave
do
we
again
draw
closer
ever
closer
to
the
cradle
ii
i
can
not
say
but
what
happened
to
myself
that
much
at
any
rate
i
know
at
my
first
halt
along
the
road
of
life
my
first
glance
backwards
i
began
by
relating
the
tale
of
bernard
and
his
uncle
berthelin
then
the
story
of
ange
pitou
his
fair
and
of
aunt
angélique
after
that
i
told
of
conscience
and
mariette
and
lastly
of
catherine
blum
and
father
vatrin
i
am
now
going
to
tell
you
the
story
of
thibault
and
his
wolves
and
of
the
lord
of
vez
and
how
you
will
ask
did
i
become
acquainted
with
the
events
which
i
am
now
about
to
bring
before
you
i
will
tell
you
have
you
read
my
and
do
you
remember
one
by
name
mocquet
who
was
a
friend
of
my
father
s
if
you
have
read
them
you
will
have
some
vague
recollection
of
this
personage
if
you
have
not
read
them
you
will
not
remember
anything
about
him
at
all
in
either
case
then
it
is
of
the
first
importance
that
i
should
bring
mocquet
clearly
before
your
mind
s
eye
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
that
is
when
i
was
about
three
years
of
age
we
lived
my
father
and
mother
and
i
in
a
little
château
called
les
fossés
situated
on
the
boundary
that
separates
the
departments
of
aisne
and
oise
between
haramont
and
longpré
the
little
house
in
question
had
doubtless
been
named
les
fossés
on
account
of
the
deep
and
broad
moat
filled
with
water
with
which
it
was
surrounded
i
do
not
mention
my
sister
for
she
was
at
school
in
paris
and
we
only
saw
her
once
a
year
when
she
was
home
for
a
month
s
holiday
the
household
apart
from
my
father
mother
and
myself
consisted
firstly
of
a
large
black
dog
called
truffe
who
was
a
privileged
animal
and
made
welcome
wherever
he
appeared
more
especially
as
i
regularly
went
about
on
his
back
secondly
of
a
gardener
named
pierre
who
kept
me
amply
provided
with
frogs
and
snakes
two
species
of
living
creatures
in
which
i
was
particularly
interested
thirdly
of
a
negro
a
valet
of
my
father
s
named
hippolyte
a
sort
of
black
whom
my
father
i
believe
only
kept
that
he
might
be
well
primed
with
anecdotes
wherewith
to
gain
the
advantage
in
his
encounters
with
brunel
a
and
beat
his
wonderful
stories
fourthly
of
a
keeper
named
mocquet
for
whom
i
had
a
great
admiration
seeing
that
he
had
magnificent
stories
to
tell
of
ghosts
and
to
which
i
listened
every
evening
and
which
were
abruptly
broken
off
the
instant
the
general
as
my
father
was
usually
called
appeared
on
the
scene
fifthly
of
a
cook
who
answered
to
the
name
of
marie
but
this
figure
i
can
no
longer
recall
it
is
lost
to
me
in
the
misty
twilight
of
life
i
remember
only
the
name
as
given
to
someone
of
whom
but
a
shadowy
outline
remains
in
my
memory
and
about
whom
as
far
as
i
recollect
there
was
nothing
of
a
very
poetic
character
a
see
mocquet
however
is
the
only
person
that
need
occupy
our
attention
for
the
present
let
me
try
to
make
him
known
to
you
both
as
regards
his
personal
appearance
and
his
character
iii
mocquet
was
a
man
of
about
forty
years
of
age
short
broad
of
shoulder
and
sturdy
of
leg
his
skin
was
burnt
brown
by
the
sun
his
eyes
were
small
and
piercing
his
hair
grizzled
and
his
black
whiskers
met
under
his
chin
in
a
half
circle
as
i
look
back
his
figure
rises
before
me
wearing
a
hat
and
clad
in
a
green
waistcoat
with
silver
buttons
velveteen
cord
breeches
and
high
leathern
gaiters
with
a
over
his
shoulder
his
gun
in
his
hand
and
a
in
his
mouth
let
us
pause
for
a
moment
to
consider
this
pipe
for
this
pipe
grew
to
be
not
merely
an
accessory
but
an
integral
part
of
mocquet
nobody
could
remember
ever
having
seen
mocquet
without
it
if
by
any
chance
mocquet
did
not
happen
to
have
it
in
his
mouth
he
had
it
in
his
hand
this
pipe
having
to
accompany
mocquet
into
the
heart
of
the
thickest
coverts
it
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
of
such
a
kind
as
to
offer
the
least
possible
opportunity
to
any
other
solid
body
of
bringing
about
its
destruction
for
the
destruction
of
his
old
cutty
would
have
been
to
mocquet
a
loss
that
years
alone
could
have
repaired
therefore
the
stem
of
mocquet
s
pipe
was
not
more
than
long
moreover
you
might
always
wager
that
half
that
half
inch
at
least
was
supplied
by
the
quill
of
a
feather
this
habit
of
never
being
without
his
pipe
which
by
causing
the
almost
entire
disappearance
of
both
canines
had
hollowed
out
a
sort
of
vice
for
itself
on
the
left
side
of
his
mouth
between
the
fourth
incisor
and
the
first
molar
had
given
rise
to
another
of
mocquet
s
habits
this
was
to
speak
with
his
teeth
clenched
whereby
a
certain
impression
of
obstinacy
was
conveyed
by
all
he
this
became
even
more
marked
if
mocquet
chanced
at
any
moment
to
take
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
for
there
was
nothing
then
to
prevent
the
jaws
closing
and
the
teeth
coming
together
in
a
way
which
prevented
the
words
passing
through
them
at
all
except
in
a
sort
of
whistle
which
was
hardly
intelligible
such
was
mocquet
with
respect
to
outward
appearance
in
the
following
pages
i
will
endeavour
to
give
some
idea
of
his
intellectual
capacity
and
moral
qualities
iv
early
one
morning
before
my
father
had
risen
mocquet
walked
into
his
room
and
planted
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
stiff
and
upright
as
a
well
mocquet
said
my
father
what
s
the
matter
now
what
gives
me
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
here
at
this
early
hour
the
matter
is
general
replied
mocquet
with
the
utmost
gravity
the
matter
is
that
i
am
mocquet
had
quite
unawares
to
himself
enriched
the
language
with
a
double
verb
both
active
and
passive
you
are
responded
my
father
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
dear
dear
that
s
a
serious
matter
my
poor
you
are
right
there
and
mocquet
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
a
thing
he
did
rarely
and
only
on
the
most
important
occasions
and
how
long
have
you
been
continued
my
father
compassionately
for
a
whole
week
and
who
by
mocquet
ah
i
know
very
well
who
by
answered
mocquet
through
his
teeth
which
were
so
much
the
more
tightly
closed
that
his
pipe
was
in
his
hand
and
his
hand
behind
his
back
and
may
i
also
know
by
whom
by
mother
durand
of
haramont
who
as
you
will
have
heard
is
an
old
no
indeed
i
assure
you
i
had
no
idea
of
such
a
ah
but
i
know
it
well
enough
i
ve
seen
her
riding
past
on
her
broomstick
to
her
witches
you
have
seen
her
go
by
on
her
broomstick
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
general
and
more
than
that
she
has
an
old
black
at
home
that
she
and
why
should
she
come
and
nightmare
you
to
revenge
herself
on
me
because
i
came
upon
her
once
at
midnight
on
the
heath
of
gondreville
when
she
was
dancing
round
and
round
in
her
devil
s
this
is
a
most
serious
accusation
which
you
bring
against
her
my
friend
and
before
repeating
to
anyone
what
you
have
been
telling
me
in
private
i
think
it
would
be
as
well
if
you
tried
to
collect
some
more
proofs
what
more
proofs
do
i
want
does
not
every
soul
in
the
village
know
that
in
her
youth
she
was
the
mistress
of
thibault
the
indeed
i
must
look
carefully
into
this
matter
i
am
looking
very
carefully
into
it
myself
and
she
shall
pay
for
it
the
old
mole
was
an
expression
that
mocquet
had
borrowed
from
his
friend
pierre
the
gardener
who
as
he
had
no
worse
enemies
to
deal
with
than
moles
gave
the
name
of
mole
to
everything
and
everybody
that
he
particularly
detested
v
i
must
look
carefully
into
this
matter
these
words
were
not
said
by
my
father
by
reason
of
any
belief
he
had
in
the
truth
of
mocquet
s
tale
about
his
nightmare
and
even
the
fact
of
the
nightmare
being
admitted
by
him
he
gave
no
credence
to
the
idea
that
it
was
mother
durand
who
had
the
keeper
far
from
it
but
my
father
was
not
ignorant
of
the
superstitions
of
the
people
and
he
knew
that
belief
in
spells
was
still
among
the
peasantry
in
the
country
districts
he
had
heard
of
terrible
acts
of
revenge
carried
out
by
the
victims
on
some
man
or
woman
who
they
thought
had
bewitched
them
in
the
belief
that
the
charm
would
thus
be
broken
and
mocquet
while
he
stood
denouncing
mother
durand
to
my
father
had
had
such
an
accent
of
menace
in
his
voice
and
had
given
such
a
grip
to
his
gun
that
my
father
thought
it
wise
to
appear
to
agree
with
everything
he
said
in
order
to
gain
his
confidence
and
so
prevent
him
doing
anything
without
first
consulting
him
so
thinking
that
he
had
so
far
gained
an
influence
over
mocquet
my
father
ventured
to
say
but
before
you
make
her
pay
for
it
my
good
mocquet
you
ought
to
be
quite
sure
that
no
one
can
cure
you
of
your
no
one
can
cure
me
general
replied
mocquet
in
a
tone
of
conviction
how
no
one
able
to
cure
you
no
one
i
have
tried
the
and
how
did
you
try
first
of
all
i
drank
a
large
bowl
of
hot
wine
before
going
to
and
who
recommended
that
remedy
was
it
monsieur
lécosse
monsieur
lécosse
was
the
doctor
in
repute
at
monsieur
lécosse
exclaimed
mocquet
no
indeed
what
should
he
know
about
spells
by
my
faith
no
it
was
not
monsieur
who
was
it
then
it
was
the
shepherd
of
but
a
bowl
of
wine
you
dunderhead
why
you
must
have
been
dead
the
shepherd
drank
half
of
i
see
now
i
understand
why
he
prescribed
it
and
did
the
bowl
of
wine
have
any
effect
not
any
general
she
came
trampling
over
my
chest
that
night
just
as
if
i
had
taken
and
what
did
you
do
next
you
were
not
obliged
i
suppose
to
limit
your
efforts
to
your
bowl
of
hot
wine
i
did
what
i
do
when
i
want
to
catch
a
mocquet
made
use
of
a
phraseology
which
was
all
his
own
no
one
had
ever
succeeded
in
inducing
him
to
say
a
every
time
my
father
said
mocquet
would
answer
yes
general
i
know
a
you
still
stick
to
your
then
my
father
said
to
him
on
one
occasion
yes
general
but
not
out
of
and
why
then
may
i
ask
because
general
with
all
due
respect
to
you
you
are
mistaken
about
mistaken
i
how
because
you
ought
not
to
say
a
but
a
and
what
is
a
mocquet
it
is
an
animal
that
only
goes
about
at
night
that
is
an
animal
that
creeps
into
the
and
kills
the
pigeons
like
the
or
into
the
to
kill
the
chickens
like
the
fox
or
into
the
folds
to
kill
the
sheep
like
the
wolf
it
means
an
animal
which
is
cunning
and
deceitful
in
short
a
it
was
impossible
to
find
anything
to
say
after
such
a
logical
definition
as
my
father
therefore
remained
silent
and
mocquet
feeling
that
he
had
gained
a
victory
continued
to
call
utterly
unable
to
understand
my
father
s
obstinacy
in
continuing
to
call
so
now
you
understand
why
when
my
father
asked
him
what
else
he
had
done
mocquet
answered
i
did
what
i
do
when
i
want
to
catch
a
we
have
interrupted
the
conversation
to
give
this
explanation
but
as
there
was
no
need
of
explanation
between
my
father
and
mocquet
they
had
gone
on
talking
you
must
understand
without
any
such
break
vi
and
what
is
it
you
do
mocquet
when
you
want
to
catch
this
animal
of
yours
asked
my
father
i
set
a
mocquet
always
called
a
trap
a
trarp
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
have
set
a
trap
to
catch
mother
durand
my
father
had
of
course
said
but
mocquet
did
not
like
anyone
to
pronounce
words
differently
from
himself
so
he
went
on
just
so
general
i
have
set
a
for
mother
and
where
have
you
put
your
outside
your
door
my
father
you
see
was
willing
to
make
concessions
outside
my
door
much
good
that
would
be
i
only
know
she
gets
into
my
room
but
i
can
not
even
guess
which
way
she
down
the
chimney
perhaps
there
is
no
chimney
and
besides
i
never
see
her
until
i
feel
and
you
do
see
her
then
as
plainly
i
see
you
and
what
does
she
do
nothing
agreeable
you
may
be
sure
she
tramples
all
over
my
chest
thud
thud
thump
thump
well
where
you
set
your
trap
then
the
why
i
put
it
on
my
own
and
what
kind
of
a
did
you
use
oh
a
what
was
it
the
one
i
made
to
catch
the
grey
wolf
with
that
used
to
kill
destournelles
not
such
a
one
then
for
the
grey
wolf
ate
up
your
bait
and
then
you
know
why
he
was
not
caught
no
i
do
because
it
was
the
black
wolf
that
belonged
to
old
thibault
the
it
could
not
have
been
thibault
s
black
wolf
for
you
said
yourself
just
this
moment
that
the
wolf
that
used
to
come
and
kill
destournelles
sheep
was
a
grey
he
is
grey
now
general
but
thirty
years
ago
when
thibault
the
was
alive
he
was
black
and
to
assure
you
of
the
truth
of
this
look
at
my
hair
which
was
black
as
a
raven
s
thirty
years
ago
and
now
is
as
grey
as
the
doctor
the
doctor
was
a
cat
an
animal
of
some
fame
that
you
will
find
mentioned
in
my
and
known
as
the
doctor
on
account
of
the
magnificent
fur
which
nature
had
given
it
for
a
coat
yes
replied
my
father
i
know
your
tale
about
thibault
the
but
if
the
black
wolf
is
the
devil
mocquet
as
you
say
he
is
he
would
not
change
not
at
all
general
only
it
takes
him
a
hundred
years
to
become
quite
white
and
the
last
midnight
of
every
hundred
years
he
turns
black
as
a
coal
i
give
up
the
case
then
mocquet
all
i
ask
is
that
you
will
not
tell
my
son
this
fine
tale
of
yours
until
he
is
fifteen
at
and
why
general
because
it
is
no
use
stuffing
his
mind
with
nonsense
of
that
kind
until
he
is
old
enough
to
laugh
at
wolves
whether
they
are
white
grey
or
it
shall
be
as
you
say
general
he
shall
hear
nothing
of
this
go
on
where
had
we
got
to
general
we
had
got
to
your
which
you
had
put
on
your
stomach
and
you
were
saying
that
it
was
a
by
my
faith
general
that
was
a
it
weighed
a
good
ten
pounds
what
am
i
saying
fifteen
pounds
at
least
with
its
chain
i
put
the
chain
over
my
wrist
and
what
happened
that
night
that
night
why
it
was
worse
than
ever
generally
it
was
in
her
leather
overshoes
she
came
and
kneaded
my
chest
but
that
night
she
came
in
her
wooden
and
she
comes
like
this
every
blessed
one
of
god
s
nights
and
it
is
making
me
quite
thin
you
can
see
for
yourself
general
i
am
growing
as
thin
as
a
lath
however
this
morning
i
made
up
my
and
what
did
you
decide
upon
mocquet
well
then
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
let
fly
at
her
with
my
that
was
a
wise
decision
to
come
to
and
when
do
you
think
of
carrying
it
out
this
evening
or
at
latest
confound
it
and
just
as
i
was
wanting
to
send
you
over
to
that
won
t
matter
general
was
it
something
that
you
wanted
done
at
once
yes
at
very
well
then
i
can
go
over
to
it
s
not
above
a
few
miles
if
i
go
through
the
wood
and
get
back
here
this
evening
the
journey
both
ways
is
only
miles
and
we
have
covered
a
few
more
than
that
before
now
out
shooting
that
s
settled
then
i
will
write
a
letter
for
you
to
give
to
collard
and
then
you
can
i
will
start
general
without
a
moment
s
my
father
rose
and
wrote
to
collard
the
letter
was
as
follows
my
dear
collard
i
am
sending
you
that
idiot
of
a
keeper
of
mine
whom
you
know
he
has
taken
into
his
head
that
an
old
woman
him
every
night
and
to
rid
himself
of
this
vampire
he
intends
nothing
more
nor
less
than
to
kill
her
justice
however
might
not
look
favourably
on
this
method
of
his
for
curing
himself
of
indigestion
and
so
i
am
going
to
start
him
off
to
you
on
a
pretext
of
some
kind
or
other
will
you
also
on
some
pretext
or
other
send
him
on
as
soon
as
he
gets
to
you
to
danré
at
vouty
who
will
send
him
on
to
dulauloy
who
with
or
without
pretext
may
then
as
far
as
i
care
send
him
on
to
the
devil
in
short
he
must
be
kept
going
for
a
fortnight
at
least
by
that
time
we
shall
have
moved
out
of
here
and
shall
be
at
antilly
and
as
he
will
then
no
longer
be
in
the
district
of
haramont
and
as
his
nightmare
will
probably
have
left
him
on
the
way
mother
durand
will
be
able
to
sleep
in
peace
which
i
should
certainly
not
advise
her
to
do
if
mocquet
were
remaining
anywhere
in
her
neighbourhood
he
is
bringing
you
six
brace
of
snipe
and
a
hare
which
we
shot
while
out
yesterday
on
the
marshes
of
vallue
a
of
my
tenderest
remembrances
to
the
fair
herminie
and
as
many
kisses
to
the
dear
little
caroline
your
friend
alex
an
hour
later
mocquet
was
on
his
way
and
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
he
rejoined
us
at
antilly
well
asked
my
father
seeing
him
reappear
in
robust
health
well
and
how
about
mother
durand
well
general
replied
mocquet
cheerfully
i
ve
got
rid
of
the
old
mole
it
seems
she
has
no
power
except
in
her
own
vii
twelve
years
had
passed
since
mocquet
s
nightmare
and
i
was
now
over
fifteen
years
of
age
it
was
the
winter
of
to
ten
years
before
that
date
i
had
alas
lost
my
father
we
no
longer
had
a
pierre
for
gardener
a
hippolyte
for
valet
or
a
mocquet
for
keeper
we
no
longer
lived
at
the
château
of
les
fossés
or
in
the
villa
at
antilly
but
in
the
of
villers
cotterets
in
a
little
house
opposite
the
fountain
where
my
mother
kept
a
de
selling
powder
and
shot
as
well
over
the
same
counter
as
you
have
already
read
in
my
although
still
young
i
was
an
enthusiastic
sportsman
as
far
as
sport
went
however
that
is
according
to
the
usual
acceptation
of
the
word
i
had
none
except
when
my
cousin
deviolaine
the
ranger
of
the
forest
at
was
kind
enough
to
ask
leave
of
my
mother
to
take
me
with
him
i
filled
up
the
remainder
of
my
time
with
poaching
for
this
double
function
of
sportsman
and
poacher
i
was
well
provided
with
a
delightful
gun
on
which
was
engraven
the
monogram
of
the
princess
borghese
to
whom
it
had
originally
belonged
my
father
had
given
it
me
when
i
was
a
child
and
when
after
his
death
everything
had
to
be
sold
i
implored
so
urgently
to
be
allowed
to
keep
my
gun
that
it
was
not
sold
with
the
other
weapons
and
the
horses
and
carriages
the
most
enjoyable
time
for
me
was
the
winter
then
the
snow
lay
on
the
ground
and
the
birds
in
their
search
for
food
were
ready
to
come
wherever
grain
was
sprinkled
for
them
some
of
my
father
s
old
friends
had
fine
gardens
and
i
was
at
liberty
to
go
and
shoot
the
birds
there
as
i
liked
so
i
used
to
sweep
the
snow
away
spread
some
grain
and
hiding
myself
within
easy
fire
at
the
birds
sometimes
killing
six
eight
or
even
ten
at
a
time
then
if
the
snow
lasted
there
was
another
thing
to
look
forward
to
the
chance
of
tracing
a
wolf
to
its
lair
and
a
wolf
so
traced
was
everybody
s
property
the
wolf
being
a
public
enemy
a
murderer
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
might
be
shot
at
by
all
or
anyone
and
so
in
spite
of
my
mother
s
cries
who
dreaded
the
double
danger
for
me
you
need
not
ask
if
i
seized
my
gun
and
was
first
on
the
spot
ready
for
sport
the
winter
of
to
had
been
long
and
severe
the
snow
was
lying
a
foot
deep
on
the
ground
and
so
hard
frozen
that
it
had
held
for
a
fortnight
past
and
still
there
were
no
tidings
of
anything
towards
four
o
clock
one
afternoon
mocquet
called
upon
us
he
had
come
to
lay
in
his
stock
of
powder
while
so
doing
he
looked
at
me
and
winked
with
one
eye
when
he
went
out
i
followed
what
is
it
mocquet
i
asked
tell
can
t
you
guess
monsieur
alexandre
no
you
don
t
guess
then
that
if
i
come
and
buy
powder
here
from
madame
your
mother
instead
of
going
to
haramont
for
it
in
short
if
i
walk
three
miles
instead
of
only
a
quarter
that
distance
that
i
might
possibly
have
a
bit
of
a
shoot
to
propose
to
you
oh
you
good
mocquet
and
what
and
where
there
s
a
wolf
monsieur
not
really
he
carried
off
one
of
destournelles
sheep
last
night
i
have
traced
him
to
the
tillet
and
what
then
why
then
i
am
certain
to
see
him
again
and
shall
find
out
where
his
lair
is
and
morning
we
ll
finish
his
business
for
oh
this
is
luck
only
we
must
first
ask
leave
of
whom
mocquet
leave
of
all
right
come
in
then
we
will
ask
her
at
my
mother
had
been
watching
us
through
the
window
she
suspected
that
some
plot
was
hatching
between
us
i
have
no
patience
with
you
mocquet
she
said
as
we
went
in
you
have
no
sense
or
in
what
way
madame
asked
mocquet
to
go
exciting
him
in
the
way
you
do
he
thinks
too
much
of
sport
as
it
nay
madame
it
is
with
him
as
with
dogs
of
breed
his
father
was
a
sportsman
he
is
a
sportsman
and
his
son
will
be
a
sportsman
after
him
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
and
supposing
some
harm
should
come
to
him
harm
come
to
him
with
me
with
mocquet
no
indeed
i
will
answer
for
it
with
my
own
life
that
he
shall
be
safe
harm
happen
to
him
to
him
the
general
s
son
never
never
never
but
my
poor
mother
shook
her
head
i
went
to
her
and
flung
my
arms
round
her
neck
mother
dearest
i
cried
please
let
me
you
will
load
his
gun
for
him
then
mocquet
have
no
fear
sixty
grains
of
powder
not
a
grain
more
or
less
and
a
twenty
to
the
pound
and
you
will
not
leave
him
i
will
stay
by
him
like
his
you
will
keep
him
near
you
between
my
i
give
him
into
your
sole
charge
and
he
shall
be
given
back
to
you
safe
and
sound
now
monsieur
alexandre

up
your
traps
and
let
us
be
off
your
mother
has
given

have
a
good
mattress

on
the

as

a
kiss

boy

mother
and
a
good
many
more
than

and
i
threw
myself
on
my
mother
s
neck
stifling
her
with
my
caresses
as
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
and
when
shall
i
see
you
again
oh
do
not
be
uneasy
if
he
does
not
return
before
how
evening
and
you
spoke
of
starting
at
dawn
at
dawn
for
the
wolf
but
if
we
miss
him
the
lad
must
have
a
shot
or
two
at
the
wild
ducks
on
the
marshes
of
i
see
you
are
going
to
drown
him
for
me
by
the
name
of
all
that
s
good
madame
if
i
was
not
speaking
to
the
general
s
widow
i
should
say
what
mocquet
what
would
you
say
that
you
will
make
nothing
but
a
wretched
milksop
of
your
boy
if
the
general
s
mother
had
been
always
behind
him
pulling
at
his
as
you
are
behind
this
child
he
would
never
even
have
had
the
courage
to
cross
the
sea
to
you
are
right
mocquet
take
him
away
i
am
a
poor
and
my
mother
turned
aside
to
wipe
away
a
tear
a
mother
s
tear
that
heart
s
diamond
more
precious
than
all
the
pearls
of
ophir
i
saw
it
running
down
her
cheek
i
ran
to
the
poor
woman
and
whispered
to
her
mother
if
you
like
i
will
stay
at
no
no
go
my
child
she
said
mocquet
is
right
you
must
sooner
or
later
learn
to
be
a
i
gave
her
another
last
kiss
then
i
ran
after
mocquet
who
had
already
started
after
i
had
gone
a
few
paces
i
looked
round
my
mother
had
run
into
the
middle
of
the
road
that
she
might
keep
me
in
sight
as
long
as
possible
it
was
my
turn
now
to
wipe
away
a
tear
how
now
said
mocquet
you
crying
too
monsieur
alexandre
nonsense
mocquet
it
s
only
the
cold
makes
my
eyes
but
thou
o
god
who
gavest
me
that
tear
thou
knowest
that
it
was
not
because
of
the
cold
that
i
was
crying
viii
it
was
pitch
dark
when
we
reached
mocquet
s
house
we
had
a
savoury
omelette
and
stewed
rabbit
for
supper
and
then
mocquet
made
my
bed
ready
for
me
he
kept
his
word
to
my
mother
for
i
had
a
good
mattress
two
white
sheets
and
two
good
warm
coverlids
now
said
mocquet
tuck
yourself
in
there
and
go
to
sleep
we
may
probably
have
to
be
off
at
four
o
clock
at
any
hour
you
like
yes
i
know
you
are
a
capital
riser
over
night
and
morning
i
shall
have
to
throw
a
jug
of
cold
water
over
you
to
make
you
get
you
are
welcome
to
do
that
mocquet
if
you
have
to
call
me
well
we
ll
see
about
are
you
in
a
hurry
to
go
to
sleep
mocquet
why
whatever
do
you
want
me
to
do
at
this
hour
of
the
night
i
thought
perhaps
mocquet
you
would
tell
me
one
of
those
stories
that
i
used
to
find
so
amusing
when
i
was
a
and
who
is
going
to
get
up
for
me
at
two
o
clock
if
i
sit
telling
you
tales
till
midnight
our
good
priest
perhaps
you
are
right
it
s
fortunate
you
think
so
so
i
undressed
and
went
to
bed
five
minutes
later
mocquet
was
snoring
like
a
bass
viol
i
turned
and
twisted
for
a
good
two
hours
before
i
could
get
to
sleep
how
many
sleepless
nights
have
i
not
passed
on
the
eve
of
the
first
shoot
of
the
season
at
last
towards
midnight
fatigue
gained
the
mastery
over
me
a
sudden
sensation
of
cold
awoke
me
with
a
start
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
opened
my
eyes
mocquet
had
thrown
my
off
over
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
was
standing
beside
me
leaning
both
hands
on
his
gun
his
face
beaming
out
upon
me
as
at
every
fresh
puff
of
his
short
pipe
the
light
from
it
illuminated
his
features
well
how
have
you
got
on
mocquet
he
has
been
tracked
to
his
the
wolf
and
who
tracked
him
this
foolish
old
bravo
but
guess
where
he
has
chosen
to
take
covert
this
most
accommodating
of
good
wolves
where
was
it
then
mocquet
if
i
gave
you
a
hundred
chances
you
wouldn
t
guess
in
the
three
oaks
we
ve
got
him
then
i
should
rather
think
the
three
oaks
covert
is
a
patch
of
trees
and
undergrowth
about
two
acres
in
extent
situated
in
the
middle
of
the
plain
of
largny
about
five
hundred
paces
from
the
forest
and
the
keepers
i
went
on
all
had
notice
sent
them
replied
mocquet
moynat
mildet
vatrin
lafeuille
all
the
best
shots
in
short
are
waiting
in
readiness
just
outside
the
forest
you
and
i
with
monsieur
charpentier
from
vallue
monsieur
hochedez
from
largny
monsieur
destournelles
from
les
fossés
are
to
surround
the
covert
the
dogs
will
be
slipped
the
will
go
with
them
and
we
shall
have
him
that
s
you
ll
put
me
in
a
good
place
mocquet
haven
t
i
said
that
you
will
be
near
me
but
you
must
get
up
that
s
true
brrou
and
i
am
going
to
have
pity
on
your
youth
and
put
a
bundle
of
wood
in
the
i
didn
t
dare
ask
for
it
but
on
my
word
of
honour
it
will
be
kind
of
you
if
you
mocquet
went
out
and
brought
in
an
armful
of
wood
from
the
and
threw
it
on
to
the
hearth
poking
it
down
with
his
foot
then
he
threw
a
lighted
match
among
the
twigs
and
in
another
moment
the
clear
bright
flames
were
dancing
and
crackling
up
the
chimney
i
went
and
sat
on
the
stool
by
the
fireside
and
there
dressed
myself
you
may
be
sure
that
i
was
not
long
over
my
toilette
even
mocquet
was
astonished
at
my
celerity
now
then
he
said
a
drop
of
this
and
then
off
and
saying
this
he
filled
two
small
glasses
with
a
yellowish
coloured
liquor
which
did
not
require
any
tasting
on
my
part
to
recognize
you
know
i
never
drink
brandy
ah
you
are
your
father
s
son
all
over
what
will
you
have
then
nothing
mocquet
you
know
the
proverb
leave
the
house
empty
the
devil
will
be
believe
me
you
had
better
put
something
into
your
stomach
while
i
load
your
gun
for
i
must
keep
my
promise
to
that
poor
mother
of
well
then
i
will
have
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
glass
of
is
a
light
wine
made
in
districts
generally
said
to
require
three
men
to
drink
it
one
to
drink
and
two
to
hold
him
i
was
however
pretty
well
accustomed
to
and
could
drink
it
up
without
help
so
i
swallowed
my
glass
of
wine
while
mocquet
loaded
my
gun
what
are
you
doing
mocquet
i
asked
him
making
a
cross
on
your
bullet
he
replied
as
you
will
be
near
me
we
shall
probably
let
fly
together
and
although
i
know
you
would
give
me
up
your
share
still
for
the
glory
of
it
it
will
be
as
well
to
know
which
of
us
killed
him
if
the
wolf
falls
so
mind
you
aim
i
ll
do
my
best
here
s
your
gun
then
loaded
for
and
now
gun
over
your
shoulder
and
off
we
ix
the
was
on
the
road
leading
to
chavigny
here
we
found
the
keepers
and
some
of
the
huntsmen
and
within
another
ten
minutes
those
who
were
missing
had
also
joined
us
before
five
o
clock
struck
our
number
was
complete
and
then
we
held
a
council
of
war
to
decide
our
further
proceedings
it
was
finally
arranged
that
we
should
first
take
up
our
position
round
the
three
oaks
covert
at
some
considerable
distance
from
it
and
then
gradually
advance
so
as
to
form
a
cordon
round
it
everything
was
to
be
done
with
the
utmost
silence
it
being
well
known
that
wolves
decamp
on
hearing
the
slightest
noise
each
of
us
was
ordered
to
look
carefully
along
the
path
he
followed
to
make
quite
sure
that
the
wolf
had
not
left
the
covert
meanwhile
the
was
holding
mocquet
s
hounds
in
leash
one
by
one
we
took
our
stand
facing
the
covert
on
the
spot
to
which
our
particular
path
had
conducted
us
as
it
happened
mocquet
and
i
found
ourselves
on
the
north
side
of
the
warren
which
was
parallel
with
the
forest
mocquet
had
rightly
said
that
we
should
be
in
the
best
place
for
the
wolf
would
in
all
probability
try
and
make
for
the
forest
and
so
would
break
covert
on
our
side
of
it
we
took
our
stand
each
in
front
of
an
oak
tree
fifty
paces
apart
from
one
another
and
then
we
waited
without
moving
and
hardly
daring
to
breathe
the
dogs
on
the
farther
side
of
the
warren
were
now
uncoupled
they
gave
two
short
barks
and
were
then
silent
the
keeper
followed
them
into
the
covert
calling
halloo
as
he
beat
the
trees
with
his
stick
but
the
dogs
their
eyes
starting
out
of
their
heads
their
lips
drawn
back
and
their
coats
bristling
remained
as
if
nailed
to
the
ground
nothing
would
induce
them
to
move
a
step
further
halloa
mocquet
cried
the
keeper
this
wolf
of
yours
must
be
an
extra
plucky
one
rocador
and
tombelle
refuse
to
tackle
but
mocquet
was
too
wise
to
make
any
answer
for
the
sound
of
his
voice
would
have
warned
the
wolf
that
there
were
enemies
in
that
direction
the
keeper
went
forward
still
beating
the
trees
the
two
dogs
after
him
cautiously
advancing
step
by
step
without
a
bark
only
now
and
then
giving
a
low
growl
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
loud
exclamation
from
the
keeper
who
called
out
i
nearly
trod
on
his
tail
the
wolf
the
wolf
look
out
mocquet
look
out
and
at
that
moment
something
came
rushing
towards
us
and
the
animal
leapt
out
of
the
covert
passing
between
us
like
a
flash
of
lightning
it
was
an
enormous
wolf
nearly
white
with
age
mocquet
turned
and
sent
two
bullets
after
him
i
saw
them
bound
and
rebound
along
the
snow
shoot
shoot
he
called
out
to
me
only
then
did
i
bring
my
gun
to
the
shoulder
i
took
aim
and
fired
the
wolf
made
a
movement
as
if
he
wanted
to
bite
his
shoulder
we
have
him
we
have
him
cried
mocquet
the
lad
has
hit
his
mark
success
to
the
innocent
but
the
wolf
ran
on
making
straight
for
moynat
and
mildet
the
two
best
shots
in
the
country
round
both
their
first
shots
were
fired
at
him
in
the
open
the
second
after
he
had
entered
the
forest
the
two
first
bullets
were
seen
to
cross
one
another
and
ran
along
the
ground
sending
up
spurts
of
snow
the
wolf
had
escaped
them
both
but
he
had
no
doubt
been
struck
down
by
the
others
that
the
two
keepers
who
had
just
fired
should
miss
their
aim
was
an
of
thing
i
had
seen
moynat
kill
seventeen
snipe
one
after
the
other
i
had
seen
mildet
cut
a
squirrel
in
two
as
he
was
jumping
from
tree
to
tree
the
keepers
went
into
the
forest
after
the
wolf
we
looked
anxiously
towards
the
spot
where
they
had
disappeared
we
saw
them
reappear
dejected
and
shaking
their
heads
well
cried
mocquet
interrogatively
bah
answered
mildet
with
an
impatient
movement
of
his
arm
he
s
at
by
this
at
exclaimed
mocquet
completely
taken
aback
what
the
fools
have
gone
and
missed
him
then
well
what
of
that
you
missed
him
yourself
did
you
not
mocquet
shook
his
head
well
well
there
s
some
devilry
about
this
he
said
that
i
should
miss
him
was
surprising
but
it
was
perhaps
possible
but
that
moynat
should
have
shot
twice
and
missed
him
is
not
possible
no
i
say
nevertheless
so
it
is
my
good
besides
you
you
hit
him
he
said
to
me
i
are
you
sure
we
others
may
well
be
ashamed
to
say
it
but
as
sure
as
my
name
is
mocquet
you
hit
the
well
it
s
easy
to
find
out
if
i
did
hit
him
there
would
be
blood
on
the
come
mocquet
let
us
run
and
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
i
set
off
running
stop
stop
do
not
run
whatever
you
do
cried
mocquet
clenching
his
teeth
and
stamping
we
must
go
quietly
until
we
know
better
what
we
have
to
deal
well
we
will
go
quietly
then
but
at
any
rate
let
us
go
mocquet
then
began
to
follow
the
wolf
s
track
step
by
step
there
s
not
much
fear
of
losing
it
i
said
it
s
plain
yes
but
that
s
not
what
i
am
looking
what
are
you
looking
for
then
you
will
know
in
a
minute
or
the
other
huntsmen
had
now
joined
us
and
as
they
came
along
after
us
the
keeper
related
to
them
what
had
taken
place
meanwhile
mocquet
and
i
continued
to
follow
the
wolf
s
footprints
which
were
deeply
indented
in
the
snow
at
last
we
came
to
the
spot
where
he
had
received
my
fire
there
mocquet
i
said
to
him
you
see
i
did
miss
him
after
all
how
do
you
know
that
you
missed
him
because
there
are
no
blood
look
for
the
mark
of
your
bullet
then
in
the
i
looked
to
see
which
way
my
bullet
would
have
sped
if
it
had
not
hit
the
wolf
and
then
went
in
that
direction
but
i
tracked
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
no
purpose
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
go
back
to
mocquet
he
beckoned
to
the
keepers
to
approach
and
then
turning
to
me
said
well
and
the
bullet
i
can
not
find
i
have
been
luckier
than
you
then
for
i
have
found
what
you
found
it
right
about
and
come
behind
i
did
as
i
was
told
and
the
huntsmen
having
come
up
mocquet
pointed
out
a
line
to
them
beyond
which
they
were
not
to
pass
the
keepers
mildet
and
moynat
now
joined
us
well
said
mocquet
to
them
in
their
turn
missed
they
both
answered
at
once
i
saw
you
had
missed
him
in
the
open
but
when
he
had
reached
covert
missed
him
there
are
you
sure
both
the
bullets
have
been
found
each
of
them
in
the
trunk
of
a
it
is
almost
past
belief
said
vatrin
yes
rejoined
mocquet
it
is
almost
past
belief
but
i
have
something
to
show
you
which
is
even
more
difficult
to
show
it
us
look
there
what
do
you
see
on
the
snow
the
track
of
a
wolf
what
of
that
and
close
to
the
mark
of
the
right
foot
there
what
do
you
see
a
little
well
do
you
understand
the
keepers
looked
at
each
other
in
astonishment
do
you
understand
now
repeated
mocquet
the
thing
s
impossible
exclaimed
the
keepers
nevertheless
it
is
so
and
i
will
prove
it
to
and
so
saying
mocquet
plunged
his
hand
into
the
snow
felt
about
a
moment
or
two
and
then
with
a
cry
of
triumph
pulled
out
a
flattened
bullet
why
that
s
my
bullet
i
said
you
recognise
it
then
of
course
i
do
you
marked
it
for
and
what
mark
did
i
put
on
it
a
you
see
sirs
said
mocquet
yes
but
explain
how
this
this
is
it
he
could
turn
aside
the
ordinary
bullets
but
he
had
no
power
over
the
youngster
s
which
was
marked
with
a
cross
it
hit
him
in
the
shoulder
i
saw
him
make
a
movement
as
if
to
try
and
bite
but
i
broke
in
astonished
at
the
silence
and
amazement
which
had
fallen
on
the
keepers
if
my
bullet
hit
him
in
the
shoulder
why
did
it
not
kill
him
because
it
was
made
neither
of
gold
nor
of
silver
my
dear
boy
and
because
no
bullets
but
those
that
are
made
of
gold
or
silver
can
pierce
the
skin
of
the
devil
or
kill
those
who
have
made
a
compact
with
but
mocquet
said
the
keepers
shuddering
do
you
really
think
think
yes
i
do
i
could
swear
that
we
have
had
to
do
this
morning
with
thibault
the
s
the
huntsman
and
keepers
looked
at
one
another
two
or
three
of
them
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
they
all
appeared
to
share
mocquet
s
opinion
and
to
know
quite
well
what
he
meant
by
thibault
s
wolf
i
alone
knew
nothing
about
it
and
therefore
asked
impatiently
what
is
this
wolf
and
who
is
this
thibault
the
mocquet
hesitated
before
replying
then
ah
to
be
sure
he
exclaimed
the
general
told
me
that
i
might
let
you
know
about
it
when
you
were
fifteen
you
are
that
age
now
are
you
not
i
am
sixteen
i
replied
with
some
pride
well
then
my
dear
monsieur
alexandre
thibault
the
s
wolf
is
the
devil
you
were
asking
me
last
night
for
a
tale
were
you
not
come
back
home
with
me
this
morning
then
and
i
will
tell
you
a
tale
and
a
fine
one
the
keepers
and
huntsmen
shook
hands
with
one
another
in
silence
and
separated
each
going
his
own
way
i
went
back
with
mocquet
who
then
told
me
the
tale
which
you
shall
now
hear
perhaps
you
will
ask
me
why
having
heard
it
so
long
ago
i
have
not
told
it
before
i
can
only
answer
you
by
saying
it
has
remained
hidden
away
in
a
drawer
of
my
memory
which
has
remained
closed
ever
since
and
which
i
only
opened
again
three
days
ago
i
would
tell
you
what
induced
me
to
do
this
but
you
might
i
fear
find
the
recital
somewhat
tedious
and
as
it
would
take
time
i
prefer
starting
at
once
upon
my
tale
i
say
my
tale
i
ought
perhaps
to
call
it
mocquet
s
tale
but
upon
my
word
when
you
have
been
sitting
on
an
egg
for
years
you
may
be
excused
for
coming
to
believe
at
last
that
you
ve
laid
it
yourself
the
chapter
i
the
grand
master
of
his
highness
wolf
hounds
the
seigneur
jean
baron
of
vez
was
a
hardy
and
indefatigable
sportsman
if
you
follow
the
beautiful
valley
which
runs
between
berval
and
longpré
you
will
see
on
your
left
hand
an
old
tower
which
by
reason
of
its
isolated
position
will
appear
doubly
high
and
formidable
to
you
at
the
present
moment
it
belongs
to
an
old
friend
of
the
writer
of
this
tale
and
everyone
is
now
so
accustomed
to
its
forbidding
aspect
that
the
peasant
passing
that
way
in
summer
has
no
more
fear
of
seeking
shelter
from
the
heat
beneath
its
walls
than
the
martins
with
their
long
black
wings
and
shrill
cries
and
the
swallows
with
their
soft
chirrupings
have
of
building
their
nests
under
its
eaves
but
at
the
time
we
are
now
speaking
of
somewhere
about
this
lordly
dwelling
of
vez
was
looked
upon
with
different
eyes
and
it
must
be
confessed
it
did
not
then
offer
so
safe
a
place
of
retreat
it
was
a
building
of
the
twelfth
or
thirteenth
century
rugged
and
gloomy
its
terrifying
exterior
having
assumed
no
kindlier
aspect
as
the
years
rolled
by
true
the
sentinel
with
his
measured
tread
and
flashing
no
longer
paced
its
ramparts
the
archer
with
his
horn
no
longer
kept
watch
and
ward
on
the
battlements
true
the
postern
was
no
longer
guarded
by
true
men
at
arms
ready
at
the
least
signal
of
danger
to
lower
the
portcullis
and
draw
up
the
bridge
but
the
solitude
alone
which
surrounded
this
grim
giant
of
granite
was
sufficient
to
inspire
the
feeling
of
majesty
awakened
by
all
mute
and
motionless
things
the
lord
of
this
old
fortress
however
was
by
no
means
so
much
to
be
dreaded
those
who
were
more
intimately
acquainted
with
him
than
were
the
peasants
and
could
do
him
more
justice
asserted
that
his
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
and
that
he
caused
more
fear
than
harm
that
is
among
his
fellow
christians
with
the
animals
of
the
forest
it
was
different
for
he
was
avowedly
their
mortal
and
implacable
enemy
he
was
chief
to
his
royal
highness
louis
philippe
of
orleans
the
fourth
of
that
name
a
post
which
allowed
him
to
gratify
the
inordinate
passion
he
had
for
the
chase
although
it
was
not
easy
it
was
yet
possible
to
bring
the
baron
to
listen
to
reason
in
other
matters
but
as
regards
the
chase
if
once
he
had
got
a
fixed
idea
in
his
head
nothing
would
satisfy
him
until
he
had
carried
it
out
and
had
achieved
his
purpose
his
wife
according
to
report
was
the
natural
daughter
of
the
prince
which
in
conjunction
with
his
title
of
chief
gave
him
almost
absolute
power
throughout
the
domains
of
his
illustrious
a
power
which
no
one
dared
to
contest
with
him
especially
after
the
of
his
royal
highness
with
madame
de
montesson
this
had
taken
place
in
since
which
date
he
had
almost
abandoned
his
castle
at
for
his
delightful
residence
at
bagnolet
where
he
entertained
all
the
first
wits
of
the
day
and
amused
himself
with
and
so
whether
the
sun
was
shining
to
rejoice
the
earth
or
the
rain
was
saddening
it
whether
the
winter
fields
lay
hidden
beneath
a
shroud
of
snow
or
the
spring
had
spread
her
fresh
green
carpet
over
the
meadows
it
was
rare
on
any
day
of
the
year
not
to
see
the
great
gates
of
the
castle
thrown
wide
open
between
eight
and
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
first
the
baron
come
forth
and
immediately
after
him
his
chief
pricker
marcotte
followed
by
the
other
prickers
then
appeared
the
dogs
coupled
and
held
in
leash
by
the
keepers
of
the
hounds
under
the
superintendence
of
engoulevent
who
aspired
to
become
a
pricker
even
as
the
german
executioner
walks
alone
behind
the
nobles
and
in
front
of
the
citizens
to
show
that
he
is
the
least
of
the
former
and
the
first
of
the
latter
so
he
walked
immediately
after
the
prickers
and
ahead
of
the
keepers
of
the
hounds
as
being
the
chief
of
the
and
least
of
the
prickers
the
whole
procession
filed
out
of
the
castle
court
in
full
hunting
array
with
the
english
horses
and
the
french
hounds
twelve
horses
and
forty
dogs
before
we
go
any
farther
let
me
say
that
with
these
twelve
horses
and
forty
dogs
the
baron
hunted
every
sort
of
quarry
but
more
especially
the
wolf
in
order
no
doubt
to
do
honour
to
his
title
no
further
proof
will
be
needed
by
the
genuine
sportsman
of
the
fine
faith
he
had
in
the
general
quality
of
his
hounds
and
in
their
keenness
of
scent
than
the
fact
that
next
to
the
wolf
he
gave
preference
to
the
boar
then
to
the
red
deer
then
to
the
and
lastly
to
the
roebuck
finally
if
the
keepers
of
the
pack
failed
to
sight
the
animal
they
had
tracked
he
uncoupled
at
random
and
went
after
the
first
hare
that
crossed
his
path
for
as
we
have
already
stated
the
worthy
baron
went
out
hunting
every
day
and
he
would
sooner
have
gone
for
hours
without
food
or
drink
although
he
was
often
thirsty
than
have
spent
that
time
without
seeing
his
hounds
run
but
as
everybody
knows
however
swift
the
horses
and
however
keen
the
dogs
hunting
has
its
bad
times
as
well
as
its
good
one
day
marcotte
came
up
to
where
the
baron
was
awaiting
him
with
a
crestfallen
expression
of
countenance
how
now
marcotte
asked
the
baron
frowning
what
is
the
matter
this
time
i
see
by
your
face
we
are
to
expect
bad
sport
marcotte
shook
his
head
speak
up
man
continued
the
baron
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
the
matter
is
my
lord
that
the
black
wolf
is
ah
ah
exclaimed
the
baron
his
eyes
sparkling
for
you
must
know
that
this
made
the
fifth
or
sixth
time
that
the
worthy
baron
had
started
the
animal
in
question
but
never
once
had
he
been
able
to
get
within
of
him
or
to
run
him
down
yes
marcotte
went
on
but
the
damned
beast
has
employed
himself
so
well
all
night
crossing
his
track
and
doubling
that
after
having
traced
him
over
half
the
forest
i
found
myself
at
the
place
from
which
i
you
think
then
marcotte
that
there
is
no
chance
of
getting
near
i
am
afraid
by
all
the
devils
in
hell
exclaimed
the
lord
of
vez
who
had
not
had
his
equal
in
swearing
since
the
mighty
nimrod
however
i
am
not
feeling
well
and
i
must
have
a
burst
of
some
kind
to
get
rid
of
these
bad
humours
what
do
you
think
we
can
hunt
marcotte
in
place
of
this
damned
black
wolf
well
having
been
so
taken
up
with
the
wolf
answered
marcotte
i
have
not
traced
any
other
animal
will
my
lord
uncouple
at
random
and
hunt
the
first
animal
that
we
come
across
the
baron
was
about
to
express
his
willingness
to
agree
to
this
proposal
when
he
caught
sight
of
little
engoulevent
coming
towards
them
cap
in
hand
wait
a
moment
he
said
here
comes
engoulevent
who
i
fancy
has
some
advice
to
give
i
have
no
advice
to
give
to
a
noble
lord
like
yourself
replied
engoulevent
assuming
an
expression
of
humility
on
his
sly
and
crafty
face
it
is
however
my
duty
to
inform
you
that
there
is
a
splendid
buck
in
the
let
us
see
your
buck
engoulevent
replied
the
chief
and
if
you
are
not
mistaken
about
it
there
will
be
a
new
crown
for
where
is
this
buck
of
yours
asked
marcotte
but
look
to
your
skin
if
you
make
us
uncouple
to
no
let
me
have
matador
and
jupiter
and
then
we
shall
matador
and
jupiter
were
the
finest
among
the
hounds
belonging
to
the
lord
of
vez
and
indeed
engoulevent
had
not
gone
a
hundred
paces
with
them
through
the
thicket
before
by
the
lashing
of
their
tails
and
their
repeated
yelping
he
knew
that
they
were
on
the
right
scent
in
another
minute
or
two
a
magnificent
stag
came
into
view
marcotte
cried
sounded
his
horn
and
the
hunt
began
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
lord
of
vez
who
although
regretting
the
black
wolf
was
willing
to
make
the
best
of
a
fine
buck
in
its
stead
the
hunt
had
lasted
two
hours
and
the
quarry
still
held
on
it
had
first
led
its
pursuers
from
the
little
wood
of
haramont
to
the
chemin
du
pendu
and
thence
straight
to
the
back
of
oigny
and
it
still
showed
no
sign
of
fatigue
for
it
was
not
one
of
those
poor
animals
of
the
flat
country
who
get
their
tails
pulled
by
every
wretched
terrier
as
it
neared
the
low
grounds
of
however
it
evidently
decided
that
it
was
being
run
rather
hard
for
it
gave
up
the
bolder
measures
which
had
hitherto
enabled
it
to
keep
ahead
and
began
to
double
its
first
manœuvre
was
to
go
down
to
the
brook
which
joins
the
ponds
of
baisemont
and
bourg
then
to
walk
against
stream
with
the
water
up
to
its
haunches
for
nearly
half
a
mile
it
then
sprang
on
to
the
right
bank
back
again
into
the
bed
of
the
stream
made
another
leap
to
the
left
and
with
a
succession
of
bounds
as
vigorous
as
its
failing
strength
allowed
continued
to
its
pursuers
but
the
dogs
of
my
lord
baron
were
not
animals
to
be
put
out
by
such
trifles
as
these
being
both
sagacious
and
they
of
their
own
accord
divided
the
task
between
themselves
half
going
up
stream
and
half
down
these
hunting
on
the
right
those
on
the
left
and
so
effectually
that
they
ere
long
put
the
animal
off
its
changes
for
they
soon
recovered
the
scent
rallying
at
the
first
cry
given
by
one
of
the
pack
and
starting
afresh
on
the
chase
as
ready
and
eager
as
if
the
deer
had
been
only
twenty
paces
in
front
of
them
and
so
with
galloping
of
horses
with
cry
of
hounds
and
blare
of
horn
the
baron
and
his
huntsmen
reached
the
ponds
of
saint
antoine
a
hundred
paces
or
so
from
the
confines
of
oigny
between
these
and
the
stood
the
hut
of
thibault
the
we
must
pause
to
give
some
description
of
this
thibault
the
the
real
hero
of
the
tale
you
will
ask
why
i
who
have
summoned
kings
to
appear
upon
the
stage
who
have
obliged
princes
dukes
and
barons
to
play
secondary
parts
in
my
romances
should
take
a
simple
for
the
hero
of
this
tale
first
i
will
reply
by
saying
that
in
my
dear
home
country
of
there
are
more
than
barons
dukes
and
princes
and
that
as
soon
as
i
decided
to
make
the
forest
the
scene
of
the
events
i
am
about
to
record
i
was
obliged
to
choose
one
of
the
actual
inhabitants
of
this
forest
as
hero
unless
i
had
wished
to
represent
such
fantastic
persons
as
the
of
marmontel
or
the
of
de
florian
more
than
that
it
is
not
the
author
who
decides
on
the
subject
but
the
subject
which
takes
possession
of
the
author
and
good
or
bad
this
particular
subject
has
taken
possession
of
me
i
will
therefore
endeavour
to
draw
thibault
s
portrait
for
you
plain
as
he
was
as
exactly
as
the
artist
paints
the
portrait
which
a
prince
desires
to
send
to
his
thibault
was
a
man
between
and
years
of
age
tall
well
made
physically
robust
but
by
nature
melancholy
and
sad
of
heart
this
depression
of
spirits
arose
from
a
little
grain
of
envy
which
in
spite
of
himself
perhaps
unconsciously
to
himself
he
harboured
towards
all
such
of
his
neighbours
as
had
been
more
favoured
by
fortune
than
himself
his
father
had
committed
a
fault
a
serious
one
at
all
times
but
more
especially
in
those
days
of
absolutism
when
a
man
was
not
able
to
rise
above
his
station
as
when
with
sufficient
capacity
he
may
attain
to
any
rank
thibault
had
been
educated
above
his
position
he
had
been
at
school
under
the
abbé
fortier
at
and
had
learnt
to
read
write
and
cypher
moreover
he
knew
a
little
latin
which
made
him
inordinately
proud
of
himself
thibault
had
spent
a
great
part
of
his
time
in
reading
and
his
books
had
been
chiefly
those
which
were
in
vogue
at
the
close
of
the
preceding
century
but
he
had
not
been
a
sufficiently
clever
analyst
to
know
how
to
separate
the
good
from
the
bad
or
rather
he
separated
what
was
bad
and
swallowed
it
in
large
doses
leaving
the
good
to
precipitate
itself
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
at
twenty
years
of
age
thibault
had
certainly
had
dreams
of
being
something
other
than
a
he
had
for
instance
for
a
very
little
while
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
army
but
his
comrades
who
had
worn
the
double
livery
of
king
and
country
had
left
the
service
as
they
entered
it
mere
soldiers
of
the
ranks
having
failed
during
five
or
six
years
of
slavery
to
obtain
promotion
even
to
the
not
very
exalted
grade
of
corporal
thibault
had
also
thought
of
becoming
a
sailor
but
a
career
in
the
navy
was
as
much
forbidden
to
the
plebeian
as
one
in
the
army
possibly
after
enduring
danger
and
storm
and
battle
for
fifteen
or
twenty
years
he
might
be
made
a
boatswain
s
mate
that
was
all
and
then
besides
it
was
by
no
means
thibault
s
ambition
to
wear
a
short
vest
and
trousers
but
the
blue
uniform
of
the
king
with
red
vest
and
gold
epaulettes
he
had
moreover
known
of
no
single
case
in
which
the
son
of
a
mere
had
become
master
of
a
frigate
or
even
lieutenant
so
he
was
forced
to
give
up
all
idea
of
joining
the
king
s
navy
thibault
would
not
have
minded
being
a
notary
and
at
one
time
thought
of
apprenticing
himself
to
the
royal
scrivener
maître
niquet
as
a
and
of
making
his
way
up
on
the
strength
of
his
own
legs
and
with
the
help
of
his
pen
but
supposing
him
to
have
risen
to
the
position
of
head
clerk
with
a
salary
of
a
hundred
crowns
where
was
he
to
find
the
thirty
thousand
francs
which
would
be
required
for
the
purchase
of
the
smallest
village
practice
there
was
therefore
no
better
chance
of
his
becoming
a
scrivener
than
of
becoming
an
officer
on
sea
or
land
meanwhile
thibault
s
father
died
leaving
very
little
ready
money
there
was
about
enough
to
bury
him
so
he
was
buried
and
this
done
there
remained
some
thirty
or
forty
francs
over
for
thibault
thibault
knew
his
trade
well
indeed
he
was
a
workman
but
he
had
no
inclination
to
handle
either
auger
or
parer
it
ended
therefore
by
his
leaving
all
his
father
s
tools
in
the
care
of
a
friend
a
remnant
of
prudence
still
remaining
to
him
and
selling
every
vestige
of
furniture
having
thus
realised
a
sum
of
five
hundred
and
forty
livres
he
determined
to
make
what
was
then
called
the
tour
of
france
thibault
spent
three
years
in
travelling
he
did
not
make
his
fortune
during
that
time
but
he
learnt
a
great
many
things
in
the
course
of
his
journey
of
which
he
was
previously
ignorant
and
acquired
certain
accomplishments
which
he
had
previously
been
without
he
learned
amongst
other
things
that
although
it
was
as
well
to
keep
one
s
word
on
matters
of
business
with
a
man
it
was
no
use
whatever
keeping
love
vows
made
to
a
woman
so
much
for
his
character
and
habits
of
mind
as
to
his
external
accomplishments
he
could
dance
a
jig
beautifully
could
hold
his
own
at
against
four
men
and
could
handle
the
as
cleverly
as
the
best
huntsman
going
all
these
things
had
not
a
little
served
to
increase
thibault
s
natural
and
seeing
himself
handsomer
stronger
and
cleverer
than
many
of
the
nobles
he
would
exclaim
against
providence
crying
why
was
i
not
nobly
born
why
was
not
that
nobleman
yonder
born
a
peasant
but
as
providence
took
care
not
to
make
any
answer
to
these
apostrophés
and
as
thibault
found
that
dancing
playing
at
and
throwing
the
only
fatigued
the
body
without
procuring
him
any
material
advantage
he
began
to
turn
his
thoughts
towards
his
ancient
trade
humble
though
it
was
saying
to
himself
if
it
enabled
the
father
to
live
it
would
also
enable
the
son
so
thibault
went
and
fetched
away
his
tools
and
then
tools
in
hand
he
went
to
ask
permission
of
the
steward
of
his
royal
highness
louis
philippe
of
orleans
to
build
a
hut
in
the
forest
in
which
to
carry
on
his
trade
he
had
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
this
for
the
steward
knew
by
experience
that
his
master
was
a
very
man
expending
as
much
as
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
on
the
poor
he
felt
sure
therefore
that
one
who
gave
away
a
sum
like
this
would
be
willing
to
let
an
honest
workman
who
wished
to
ply
his
trade
have
thirty
or
forty
feet
of
ground
as
he
had
leave
to
establish
himself
in
whatever
part
of
the
forest
he
liked
best
thibault
chose
the
spot
near
the
where
the
roads
crossed
one
of
the
most
beautiful
parts
of
the
woods
less
than
a
mile
from
oigny
and
about
three
times
that
distance
from
the
put
up
his
built
partly
of
old
planks
given
him
by
panisis
who
had
been
having
a
sale
in
the
neighbourhood
and
partly
of
the
branches
which
the
steward
gave
him
leave
to
cut
in
the
forest
when
the
building
of
the
hut
which
consisted
of
a
bedroom
cosily
shut
in
where
he
could
work
during
the
winter
and
of
a
open
to
the
air
where
he
could
work
in
the
summer
was
completed
thibault
began
to
think
of
making
himself
a
bed
at
first
a
layer
of
fern
had
to
serve
for
this
purpose
but
after
he
had
made
a
hundred
pairs
of
wooden
shoes
and
had
sold
these
to
bedeau
who
kept
a
general
shop
at
he
was
able
to
pay
a
sufficient
deposit
to
get
a
mattress
to
be
paid
for
in
full
by
the
end
of
three
months
the
framework
of
the
bed
was
not
difficult
to
make
thibault
was
not
the
he
was
without
being
a
bit
of
a
carpenter
into
the
bargain
and
when
this
was
finished
he
plaited
osiers
to
take
the
place
of
sacking
laid
the
mattress
upon
them
and
found
himself
at
last
with
a
bed
to
lie
upon
little
by
little
came
the
sheets
and
then
in
their
turn
the
coverlids
the
next
purchase
was
a
and
earthenware
pots
to
cook
in
and
finally
some
plates
and
dishes
before
the
year
was
out
thibault
had
also
made
additions
to
his
furniture
of
a
fine
oak
chest
and
a
fine
cupboard
both
like
the
bed
his
own
handiwork
all
the
while
he
was
driving
a
brisk
trade
for
none
could
beat
thibault
in
turning
a
block
of
beech
into
a
pair
of
shoes
and
in
converting
the
odd
chips
into
spoons
and
natty
little
bowls
he
had
now
been
settled
in
his
for
three
years
that
is
ever
since
his
return
after
the
completion
of
his
tour
round
france
and
there
was
nothing
for
which
anyone
could
have
reproached
him
during
this
interval
except
the
failing
we
have
already
mentioned
that
he
was
rather
more
envious
of
the
good
fortune
of
his
neighbour
than
was
altogether
conducive
to
the
welfare
of
his
soul
but
this
feeling
was
as
yet
so
inoffensive
that
his
confessor
had
no
need
to
do
more
than
awaken
in
him
a
sense
of
shame
for
harbouring
thoughts
which
had
so
far
not
resulted
in
any
active
crime
chapter
ii
the
seigneur
jean
and
the
as
already
said
the
buck
began
to
dodge
and
double
on
reaching
oigny
turning
and
twisting
round
thibault
s
hut
and
the
weather
being
fine
although
the
autumn
was
well
advanced
the
was
sitting
at
his
work
in
his
open
looking
up
he
suddenly
espied
the
trembling
animal
quivering
in
every
limb
standing
a
few
paces
in
front
of
him
gazing
at
him
with
intelligent
and
terrified
eyes
thibault
had
been
for
a
long
time
aware
that
the
hunt
was
circling
around
oigny
at
one
time
drawing
near
to
the
village
and
then
receding
only
to
draw
near
again
there
was
nothing
therefore
very
surprising
to
him
in
the
sight
of
the
buck
yet
he
stayed
his
hand
although
he
was
busy
at
work
and
contemplated
the
animal
saint
sabot
he
exclaimed
i
should
explain
that
the
festival
of
saint
sabot
is
the
fête
saint
sabot
but
that
is
a
dainty
morsel
and
would
taste
as
fine
i
warrant
as
the
chamois
i
ate
at
vienne
once
at
the
grand
banquet
of
the
jolly
of
dauphiné
lucky
folk
who
can
dine
on
the
like
every
day
i
tasted
such
once
it
is
now
nearly
four
years
ago
and
my
mouth
waters
now
when
i
think
of
it
oh
these
lords
these
lords
with
their
fresh
meats
and
their
old
wines
at
every
meal
while
i
have
to
be
satisfied
with
potatoes
to
eat
and
water
to
drink
from
one
week
s
end
to
the
other
and
it
is
a
chance
if
even
on
sunday
i
can
feast
myself
with
a
lump
of
rusty
bacon
and
an
old
cabbage
and
a
glass
of
fit
to
make
my
old
goat
stand
on
her
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
as
soon
as
thibault
began
this
monologue
the
buck
had
turned
and
disappeared
thibault
had
finished
rounding
his
periods
and
had
just
declaimed
his
peroration
when
he
heard
himself
roughly
accosted
in
forcible
terms
ho
there
you
scoundrel
answer
it
was
the
baron
who
seeing
his
dogs
wavering
was
anxious
to
make
sure
that
they
were
not
on
the
wrong
scent
ho
there
you
scoundrel
repeated
the
have
you
seen
the
beast
there
was
evidently
something
in
the
manner
of
the
baron
s
questioning
which
did
not
please
our
philosophical
for
although
he
was
perfectly
aware
what
was
the
matter
he
answered
what
beast
curse
you
why
the
buck
we
are
hunting
he
must
have
passed
close
by
here
and
standing
gaping
as
you
do
you
must
have
seen
him
it
was
a
fine
stag
of
ten
was
it
not
which
way
did
he
go
speak
up
you
blackguard
or
you
shall
have
a
taste
of
my
the
black
plague
take
him
cub
of
a
wolf
muttered
the
to
himself
then
aloud
with
a
fine
air
of
pretended
simplicity
ah
yes
he
said
i
did
see
a
buck
was
it
not
a
eh
with
great
ah
yes
to
be
sure
a
buck
with
great
horns
or
great
corns
was
it
yes
i
saw
him
as
plain
as
i
see
you
my
lord
but
there
i
can
t
say
if
he
had
any
corns
for
i
did
not
look
at
his
feet
anyhow
he
added
with
the
air
of
a
perfect
simpleton
if
he
had
corns
they
did
not
prevent
him
at
any
other
time
the
baron
would
have
laughed
at
what
he
might
have
taken
for
genuine
stupidity
but
the
doublings
of
the
animal
were
beginning
to
put
him
into
a
regular
huntsman
s
fever
now
then
you
scoundrel
a
truce
to
this
jesting
if
you
are
in
a
humour
for
jokes
it
is
more
than
i
am
i
will
be
in
whatever
humour
it
may
please
your
lordship
i
should
well
then
answer
your
lordship
has
asked
me
nothing
as
did
the
deer
seem
tired
not
which
way
did
he
come
he
did
not
come
he
was
standing
well
but
he
must
have
come
from
one
side
or
the
ah
very
likely
but
i
did
not
see
him
which
way
did
he
go
i
would
tell
you
directly
only
i
did
not
see
him
the
lord
of
vez
cast
an
angry
look
at
thibault
is
it
some
while
ago
the
buck
passed
this
way
master
simpleton
not
so
very
long
my
about
how
long
ago
thibault
made
as
if
trying
to
remember
at
last
he
replied
it
was
i
think
the
day
before
yesterday
but
in
saying
this
the
unfortunately
could
not
suppress
a
grin
this
grin
did
not
escape
the
baron
who
spurring
his
horse
rode
down
on
thibault
with
lifted
whip
thibault
was
agile
and
with
a
single
bound
he
reached
the
shelter
of
his
whither
the
could
not
follow
as
long
as
he
remained
mounted
thibault
was
therefore
in
momentary
safety
you
are
only
bantering
and
lying
cried
the
huntsman
for
there
is
marcassino
my
best
hound
giving
cry
not
twenty
yards
off
and
if
the
deer
passed
by
where
marcassino
is
he
must
have
come
over
the
hedge
and
it
is
impossible
therefore
that
you
did
not
see
pardon
my
lord
but
according
to
our
good
priest
no
one
but
the
pope
is
infallible
and
monsieur
marcassino
may
be
marcassino
is
never
mistaken
do
you
hear
you
rascal
and
in
proof
of
it
i
can
see
from
here
the
marks
where
the
animal
scratched
up
the
nevertheless
my
lord
i
assure
you
i
swear
said
thibault
who
saw
the
baron
s
eyebrows
contracting
in
a
way
that
made
him
feel
uneasy
silence
and
come
here
blackguard
cried
my
lord
thibault
hesitated
a
moment
but
the
black
look
on
the
sportsman
s
face
became
more
and
more
threatening
and
fearing
to
increase
his
exasperation
by
disobeying
his
command
he
thought
he
had
better
go
forward
hoping
that
the
baron
merely
wished
to
ask
a
service
of
him
but
it
was
an
unlucky
move
on
his
part
for
scarcely
had
he
emerged
from
the
protection
of
the
shed
before
the
horse
of
the
lord
of
vez
urged
by
bit
and
spur
gave
a
leap
which
brought
his
rider
swooping
down
upon
thibault
while
at
the
same
moment
a
furious
blow
from
the
butt
end
of
the
baron
s
whip
fell
upon
his
head
the
stunned
by
the
blow
tottered
a
moment
lost
his
balance
and
was
about
to
fall
face
downwards
when
the
baron
drawing
his
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
with
a
violent
kick
in
the
chest
not
only
straightened
him
again
but
sent
the
poor
wretch
flying
in
an
opposite
direction
where
he
fell
with
his
back
against
the
door
of
his
hut
take
that
said
the
baron
as
he
first
felled
thibault
with
his
whip
and
then
kicked
him
take
that
for
your
lie
and
that
for
your
banter
and
then
without
troubling
himself
any
further
about
the
man
whom
he
left
lying
on
his
back
the
lord
of
vez
seeing
that
the
hounds
had
rallied
on
hearing
marcassino
s
cry
gave
them
a
cheery
note
on
his
horn
and
cantered
away
thibault
lifted
himself
up
feeling
bruised
all
over
and
began
feeling
himself
from
head
to
foot
to
make
sure
that
no
bones
were
broken
having
carefully
passed
his
hand
over
each
limb
in
succession
that
s
all
right
he
said
there
is
nothing
broken
either
above
or
below
i
am
glad
to
find
so
my
lord
baron
that
is
how
you
treat
people
because
you
happen
to
have
married
a
prince
s
bastard
daughter
but
let
me
tell
you
my
fine
fellow
it
is
not
you
who
will
eat
the
buck
you
are
hunting
it
will
be
this
blackguard
this
scoundrel
this
simpleton
of
a
thibault
who
will
eat
it
yes
it
shall
be
i
who
eat
it
that
i
vow
cried
thibault
confirming
himself
more
and
more
in
his
bold
resolution
and
it
is
no
use
being
a
man
if
having
once
made
a
vow
one
fails
to
keep
it
so
without
further
delay
thibault
thrust
his
into
his
belt
seized
his
and
after
listening
for
a
moment
to
the
cry
of
the
hounds
to
ascertain
in
which
direction
the
hunt
had
gone
he
ran
off
with
all
the
speed
of
which
a
man
s
legs
are
capable
to
get
the
start
of
them
guessing
by
the
curve
which
the
stag
and
its
pursuers
were
following
what
would
be
the
straight
line
to
take
so
as
to
intercept
them
there
were
two
ways
of
doing
his
deed
open
to
thibault
either
to
hide
himself
beside
the
path
which
the
buck
must
take
and
kill
him
with
his
or
else
to
surprise
the
animal
just
as
he
was
being
hunted
down
by
the
dogs
and
collar
him
there
and
then
and
as
he
ran
the
desire
to
revenge
himself
on
the
baron
for
the
latter
s
brutality
was
not
so
uppermost
in
thibault
s
mind
as
the
thoughts
of
the
sumptuous
manner
in
which
he
would
fare
for
the
next
month
on
the
shoulders
the
back
and
the
haunches
of
the
deer
either
salted
to
a
turn
roasted
on
the
spit
or
cut
in
slices
and
done
in
the
pan
and
these
two
ideas
moreover
of
vengeance
and
gluttony
were
so
jumbled
up
in
his
brain
that
while
still
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
he
laughed
in
his
sleeve
as
he
pictured
the
dejected
mien
of
the
baron
and
his
men
returning
to
the
castle
after
their
fruitless
day
s
hunt
and
at
the
same
time
saw
himself
seated
at
table
the
door
securely
fastened
and
a
pint
of
wine
beside
him
with
a
haunch
of
the
deer
the
rich
and
delicious
gravy
escaping
as
the
knife
returned
for
a
third
or
fourth
cut
the
deer
as
far
as
thibault
could
calculate
was
making
for
the
bridge
which
crosses
the
ourcq
between
noroy
and
troesne
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
there
was
a
bridge
spanning
the
river
formed
of
two
joists
and
a
few
planks
as
the
river
was
very
high
and
very
rapid
thibault
decided
that
the
deer
would
not
attempt
to
ford
it
so
he
hid
himself
behind
a
rock
within
reach
of
the
bridge
and
waited
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
the
graceful
head
of
the
deer
appear
above
the
rock
at
some
ten
paces
distance
the
animal
was
bending
its
ears
to
the
wind
in
the
endeavour
to
catch
the
sound
of
the
enemy
s
approach
as
it
was
borne
along
the
breeze
thibault
excited
by
this
sudden
appearance
rose
from
behind
the
rock
poised
his
and
sent
it
flying
towards
the
animal
the
buck
with
a
single
bound
reached
the
middle
of
the
bridge
a
second
carried
him
on
to
the
opposite
bank
and
a
third
bore
him
out
of
sight
the
had
passed
within
a
foot
of
the
animal
and
had
buried
itself
in
the
grass
fifteen
paces
from
where
thibault
was
standing
never
before
had
he
been
known
to
make
such
an
unskilful
throw
he
thibault
of
all
the
company
who
made
the
tour
of
france
the
one
known
to
be
surest
of
his
aim
enraged
with
himself
therefore
he
picked
up
his
weapon
and
bounded
across
the
bridge
with
an
agility
equal
to
that
of
the
deer
thibault
knew
the
country
quite
as
well
as
the
animal
he
was
pursuing
and
so
got
ahead
of
the
deer
and
once
more
concealed
himself
this
time
behind
a
up
and
not
too
far
from
a
little
footpath
the
deer
now
passed
so
close
to
him
that
thibault
hesitated
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
knock
the
animal
down
with
his
than
to
throw
the
weapon
at
it
but
his
hesitation
did
not
last
longer
than
a
flash
of
lightning
for
no
lightning
could
be
quicker
than
the
animal
itself
which
was
already
twenty
paces
off
when
thibault
threw
his
but
without
better
luck
than
the
time
before
and
now
the
baying
of
the
hounds
was
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
another
few
minutes
and
it
would
he
felt
be
impossible
for
him
to
carry
out
his
design
but
in
honour
to
his
spirit
of
persistence
be
it
said
that
in
proportion
as
the
difficulty
increased
the
greater
became
thibault
s
desire
to
get
possession
of
the
deer
i
must
have
it
come
what
will
he
cried
i
must
and
if
there
is
a
god
who
cares
for
the
poor
i
shall
have
satisfaction
of
this
confounded
baron
who
beat
me
as
if
i
were
a
dog
but
i
am
a
man
notwithstanding
and
i
am
quite
ready
to
prove
the
same
to
and
thibault
picked
up
his
and
once
more
set
off
running
but
it
would
appear
that
the
good
god
whom
he
had
just
invoked
either
had
not
heard
him
or
wished
to
drive
him
to
extremities
for
his
third
attempt
had
no
greater
success
than
the
previous
ones
by
heaven
exclaimed
thibault
god
almighty
is
assuredly
deaf
it
seems
let
the
devil
then
open
his
ears
and
hear
me
in
the
name
of
god
or
of
the
devil
i
want
you
and
i
will
have
you
cursed
animal
thibault
had
hardly
finished
this
double
blasphemy
when
the
buck
doubling
back
passed
close
to
him
for
the
fourth
time
and
disappeared
among
the
bushes
but
so
quickly
and
unexpectedly
that
thibault
had
not
even
time
to
lift
his
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
dogs
so
near
him
that
he
deemed
it
would
be
imprudent
to
continue
his
pursuit
he
looked
round
him
saw
a
oak
tree
threw
his
into
a
bush
swarmed
up
the
trunk
and
hid
himself
among
the
foliage
he
imagined
and
with
good
reason
that
since
the
deer
had
gone
ahead
again
the
hunt
would
only
pass
by
following
on
its
track
the
dogs
had
not
lost
the
scent
in
spite
of
the
quarry
s
doublings
and
they
were
not
likely
to
lose
it
now
thibault
had
not
been
seated
among
the
branches
for
above
five
minutes
when
first
the
hounds
came
into
sight
then
the
baron
who
in
spite
of
his
years
headed
the
chase
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
twenty
it
must
be
added
that
the
lord
of
vez
was
in
a
state
of
rage
that
we
will
not
even
endeavour
to
describe
to
lose
four
hours
over
a
wretched
deer
and
still
to
be
running
behind
it
such
a
thing
had
never
happened
to
him
before
he
stormed
at
his
men
he
whipped
his
dogs
and
had
so
ploughed
his
horse
s
sides
with
his
spurs
that
the
thick
coating
of
mud
which
covered
his
gaiters
was
reddened
with
blood
on
reaching
the
bridge
over
the
ourcq
however
there
had
been
an
interval
of
alleviation
for
the
baron
for
the
hounds
had
so
unanimously
taken
up
the
scent
that
the
cloak
which
the
carried
behind
him
would
have
sufficed
to
cover
the
whole
pack
as
they
crossed
the
bridge
indeed
the
baron
was
so
pleased
that
he
was
not
satisfied
with
humming
a
but
unslinging
his
he
sounded
it
with
his
full
a
thing
which
he
only
did
on
great
occasions
but
unfortunately
the
joy
of
my
lord
of
vez
was
destined
to
be
short
lived
all
of
a
sudden
just
as
the
hounds
that
were
crying
in
concert
in
a
way
which
more
and
more
delighted
the
baron
s
ears
were
passing
under
the
tree
where
thibault
was
perched
the
whole
pack
came
to
a
standstill
and
every
tongue
was
silenced
as
by
enchantment
marcotte
at
his
master
s
command
dismounted
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
traces
of
the
deer
the
ran
up
and
they
and
marcotte
looked
about
but
they
could
find
nothing
then
engoulevent
who
had
set
his
heart
on
a
being
sounded
for
the
animal
he
had
tracked
down
joined
the
others
and
he
too
began
to
search
everyone
was
searching
calling
out
and
trying
to
rouse
the
dogs
when
above
all
the
other
voices
was
heard
like
the
blast
of
a
tempest
the
voice
of
the
baron
ten
thousand
devils
he
thundered
have
the
dogs
fallen
into
a
marcotte
no
my
lord
they
are
here
but
they
are
come
to
a
how
come
to
a
standstill
exclaimed
the
baron
what
is
to
be
done
my
lord
i
can
not
understand
what
has
happened
but
such
is
the
come
to
a
check
again
exclaimed
the
baron
come
to
a
standstill
here
in
the
middle
of
the
forest
here
where
there
is
no
stream
where
the
animal
could
have
doubled
or
rock
for
it
to
climb
you
must
be
out
of
your
mind
marcotte
i
out
of
my
mind
my
lord
yes
you
you
fool
as
truly
as
your
dogs
are
all
worthless
trash
as
a
rule
marcotte
bore
with
admirable
patience
the
insults
which
the
baron
was
in
the
habit
of
lavishing
upon
everybody
about
him
at
critical
moments
of
the
chase
but
this
word
applied
to
his
dogs
was
more
than
his
habitual
could
bear
and
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
he
answered
vehemently
trash
my
lord
my
dogs
worthless
trash
dogs
that
have
brought
down
an
old
wolf
after
such
a
furious
run
that
the
best
horse
in
your
stable
was
foundered
my
dogs
trash
yes
trash
worthless
trash
i
say
it
again
marcotte
only
trash
would
stop
at
a
check
like
that
after
hunting
one
wretched
buck
so
many
hours
on
my
lord
answered
marcotte
in
a
tone
of
mingled
dignity
and
sorrow
my
lord
say
that
it
is
my
fault
call
me
a
fool
a
blockhead
a
scoundrel
a
blackguard
an
idiot
insult
me
in
my
own
person
or
in
that
of
my
wife
of
my
children
and
it
is
nothing
to
me
but
for
the
sake
of
all
my
past
services
to
you
do
not
attack
me
in
my
office
of
chief
pricker
do
not
insult
your
how
do
you
account
for
their
silence
then
tell
me
that
how
do
you
account
for
it
i
am
quite
willing
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
and
i
am
i
can
not
explain
it
any
more
than
you
can
my
lord
the
damned
animal
must
have
flown
into
the
clouds
or
disappeared
in
the
bowels
of
the
what
nonsense
are
you
talking
exclaimed
the
baron
do
you
want
to
make
out
that
the
deer
has
burrowed
like
a
rabbit
or
risen
from
the
ground
like
a
grouse
my
lord
i
meant
it
only
as
a
manner
of
speech
what
is
a
truth
what
is
the
fact
is
that
there
is
some
witchcraft
behind
all
this
as
sure
as
it
is
now
daylight
my
dogs
every
one
of
them
lay
down
at
the
same
moment
suddenly
without
an
instant
hesitation
ask
anybody
who
was
near
them
at
the
time
and
now
they
are
not
even
trying
to
recover
the
scent
but
there
they
lie
flat
on
the
ground
like
so
many
stags
in
their
lair
i
ask
you
is
it
natural
thrash
them
man
thrash
them
then
cried
the
baron
flay
the
skin
off
their
backs
there
is
nothing
like
it
for
driving
out
the
evil
and
the
baron
was
going
forward
to
emphasise
with
a
few
blows
from
his
own
whip
the
exorcisms
which
marcotte
according
to
his
orders
was
distributing
among
the
poor
beasts
when
engoulevent
hat
in
hand
drew
near
to
the
baron
and
timidly
laid
his
hand
on
the
horse
s
bridle
my
lord
said
the
keeper
of
the
kennel
i
think
i
have
just
discovered
a
cuckoo
in
that
tree
who
may
perhaps
be
able
to
give
us
some
explanation
of
what
has
what
the
devil
are
you
talking
about
with
your
cuckoo
you
ape
said
the
baron
if
you
wait
a
moment
you
scamp
i
will
teach
you
how
to
come
chaffing
your
master
like
that
and
the
baron
lifted
his
whip
but
with
all
the
heroism
of
a
spartan
engoulevent
lifted
his
arm
above
his
head
as
a
shield
and
continued
strike
if
you
will
my
lord
but
after
that
look
up
into
this
tree
and
when
your
lordship
has
seen
the
bird
that
is
perched
among
the
branches
i
think
you
will
be
more
ready
to
give
me
a
crown
than
a
and
the
good
man
pointed
to
the
oak
tree
in
which
thibault
had
taken
refuge
on
hearing
the
huntsmen
approach
he
had
climbed
up
from
branch
to
branch
and
had
finally
hoisted
himself
on
to
the
topmost
one
the
baron
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
looking
up
caught
sight
of
thibault
well
here
s
something
mighty
queer
he
cried
it
seems
that
in
the
forest
of
the
deer
burrow
like
foxes
and
men
perch
on
trees
like
crows
however
continued
the
worthy
baron
we
will
see
what
sort
of
creature
we
have
to
deal
and
putting
his
hand
to
his
mouth
he
halloed
ho
there
my
friend
would
it
be
particularly
disagreeable
for
you
to
give
me
ten
minutes
conversation
but
thibault
maintained
the
most
profound
silence
my
lord
said
engoulevent
if
you
like
and
he
made
a
sign
to
show
that
he
was
ready
to
climb
the
tree
no
no
said
the
baron
at
the
same
time
putting
out
his
hand
to
hold
him
back
ho
there
my
friend
repeated
the
baron
still
without
recognising
thibault
will
it
please
you
to
answer
me
yes
or
he
paused
a
second
i
see
it
is
evidently
no
you
pretend
to
be
deaf
my
friend
wait
a
moment
and
i
will
get
my
and
he
held
out
his
hand
to
marcotte
who
guessing
his
intention
handed
him
his
gun
thibault
who
wished
to
put
the
huntsmen
on
the
wrong
scent
was
meanwhile
pretending
to
cut
away
the
dead
branches
and
he
put
so
much
energy
into
this
feigned
occupation
that
he
did
not
perceive
the
movement
on
the
part
of
the
baron
or
if
he
saw
only
took
it
as
a
menace
without
attaching
the
importance
to
it
which
it
merited
the
waited
for
a
little
while
to
see
if
the
answer
would
come
but
as
it
did
not
he
pulled
the
trigger
the
gun
went
off
and
a
branch
was
heard
to
crack
the
branch
which
cracked
was
the
one
on
which
thibault
was
poised
the
baron
was
a
fine
shot
and
had
broken
it
just
between
the
trunk
and
the
s
foot
deprived
of
his
support
thibault
fell
rolling
from
branch
to
banch
fortunately
the
tree
was
thick
and
the
branches
strong
so
that
his
fall
was
broken
and
less
rapid
than
it
might
have
been
and
he
finally
reached
the
ground
after
many
rebounds
without
further
ill
consequences
than
a
feeling
of
great
fear
and
a
few
slight
bruises
on
that
part
of
his
body
which
had
first
come
in
contact
with
the
earth
by
beelzebub
s
horns
exclaimed
the
baron
delighted
with
his
own
skill
if
it
is
not
my
joker
of
the
morning
ah
so
you
scamp
did
the
discourse
you
had
with
my
whip
seem
too
short
to
you
that
you
are
so
anxious
to
take
it
up
again
where
we
left
off
oh
as
to
that
i
assure
you
it
is
not
so
my
lord
answered
thibault
in
a
tone
of
the
most
perfect
sincerity
so
much
the
better
for
your
skin
my
good
fellow
well
and
now
tell
me
what
you
were
doing
up
there
perched
on
the
top
of
that
my
lord
can
see
himself
answered
thibault
pointing
to
a
few
dry
twigs
lying
here
and
there
on
the
ground
i
was
cutting
a
little
dry
wood
for
ah
i
see
now
then
my
good
fellow
you
will
please
tell
us
without
any
beating
about
the
bush
what
has
become
of
our
by
the
devil
he
ought
to
know
seeing
that
he
has
been
perched
up
there
so
as
not
to
lose
any
of
its
movements
put
in
marcotte
but
i
swear
my
lord
said
thibault
that
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
you
mean
about
this
wretched
ah
i
thought
so
cried
marcotte
delighted
to
divert
his
master
s
from
himself
he
has
not
seen
it
he
has
not
seen
the
animal
at
all
he
does
not
know
what
we
mean
by
this
wretched
buck
but
look
here
my
lord
see
the
marks
on
these
leaves
where
the
animal
has
bitten
it
was
just
here
that
the
dogs
came
to
a
full
stop
and
now
although
the
ground
is
good
to
shew
every
mark
we
can
find
no
trace
of
the
animal
for
ten
twenty
or
a
hundred
paces
even
you
hear
said
the
baron
joining
his
words
on
to
those
of
the
pricker
you
were
up
there
and
the
deer
here
at
your
feet
it
did
not
go
by
like
a
mouse
without
making
any
sound
and
you
did
not
see
or
hear
you
must
needs
have
seen
or
heard
it
he
has
killed
the
deer
said
marcotte
and
hidden
it
away
in
a
bush
that
s
as
clear
as
the
oh
my
lord
cried
thibault
who
knew
better
than
anybody
else
how
mistaken
the
pricker
was
in
making
this
accusation
my
lord
by
all
the
saints
in
paradise
i
swear
to
you
that
i
have
not
killed
your
deer
i
swear
it
to
you
on
the
salvation
of
my
soul
and
may
i
perish
on
the
spot
if
i
have
given
him
even
the
slightest
scratch
and
besides
i
could
not
have
killed
him
without
wounding
him
and
if
i
had
wounded
him
blood
would
have
flowed
look
i
pray
you
sir
continued
thibault
turning
to
the
pricker
and
god
be
thanked
you
will
find
no
trace
of
blood
i
kill
a
poor
beast
and
my
god
with
what
where
is
my
weapon
god
knows
i
have
no
other
weapon
than
this
look
yourself
my
but
unfortunately
for
thibault
he
had
hardly
uttered
these
words
before
maître
engoulevent
who
had
been
prowling
about
for
some
minutes
past
carrying
the
which
thibault
had
thrown
into
one
of
the
bushes
before
climbing
up
the
tree
he
handed
the
weapon
to
the
baron
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
engoulevent
was
thibault
s
evil
genius
chapter
iii
agnelette
the
baron
took
the
weapon
which
engoulevent
handed
him
and
carefully
and
deliberately
examined
the
from
point
to
handle
without
saying
a
word
on
the
handle
had
been
carved
a
little
wooden
shoe
which
had
served
as
thibault
s
device
while
making
the
tour
of
france
as
thereby
he
was
able
to
recognise
his
own
weapon
the
baron
now
pointed
to
this
saying
to
thibault
as
he
did
so
ah
ah
master
simpleton
there
is
something
which
witnesses
terribly
against
you
i
must
confess
this
smells
to
me
uncommonly
of
venison
by
the
devil
it
does
however
all
i
have
now
to
say
to
you
is
this
you
have
been
poaching
which
is
a
serious
crime
you
have
perjured
yourself
which
is
a
great
sin
i
am
going
to
enforce
expiation
from
you
for
the
one
and
for
the
other
to
help
towards
the
salvation
of
that
soul
by
which
you
have
whereupon
turning
to
the
pricker
he
continued
marcotte
strip
off
that
rascal
s
vest
and
shirt
and
tie
him
up
to
a
tree
with
a
couple
of
the
dog
leashes
and
then
give
him
strokes
across
the
back
with
your
shoulder
belt
a
dozen
for
his
perjury
and
two
dozen
for
his
poaching
no
i
make
a
mistake
a
dozen
for
poaching
and
two
dozen
for
perjuring
himself
god
s
portion
must
be
the
this
order
caused
great
rejoicing
among
the
menials
who
thought
it
good
luck
to
have
a
culprit
on
whom
they
could
avenge
themselves
for
the
mishaps
of
the
day
in
spite
of
thibault
s
protestations
who
swore
by
all
the
saints
in
the
calender
that
he
had
killed
neither
buck
nor
doe
neither
goat
nor
kidling
he
was
divested
of
his
garments
and
firmly
strapped
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
then
the
execution
commenced
the
pricker
s
strokes
were
so
heavy
that
thibault
who
had
sworn
not
to
utter
a
sound
and
bit
his
lips
to
enable
himself
to
keep
his
resolution
was
forced
at
the
third
blow
to
open
his
mouth
and
cry
out
the
baron
as
we
have
already
seen
was
about
the
roughest
man
of
his
class
for
a
good
thirty
miles
round
but
he
was
not
and
it
was
a
distress
to
him
to
listen
to
the
cries
of
the
culprit
as
they
became
more
and
more
frequent
as
however
the
poachers
on
his
highness
s
estate
had
of
late
grown
bolder
and
more
troublesome
he
decided
that
he
had
better
let
the
sentence
be
carried
out
to
the
full
but
he
turned
his
horse
with
the
intention
of
riding
away
determined
no
longer
to
remain
as
a
spectator
illustration
a
young
girl
suddenly
emerged
from
the
underwood
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
doing
this
a
young
girl
suddenly
emerged
from
the
underwood
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
the
horse
and
lifting
her
large
beautiful
eyes
all
wet
with
tears
to
the
baron
cried
in
the
name
of
the
god
of
mercy
my
lord
have
pity
on
that
man
the
lord
of
vez
looked
down
at
the
young
girl
she
was
indeed
a
lovely
child
hardly
sixteen
years
of
age
of
a
slender
and
exquisite
figure
with
a
pink
and
white
complexion
large
blue
eyes
soft
and
tender
in
expression
and
a
crown
of
fair
hair
which
fell
in
luxuriant
waves
over
neck
and
shoulders
escaping
from
underneath
the
shabby
little
grey
linen
cap
which
endeavoured
in
vain
to
imprison
them
all
this
the
baron
took
in
with
a
glance
in
spite
of
the
humble
clothing
of
the
beautiful
suppliant
and
as
he
had
no
dislike
to
a
pretty
face
he
smiled
down
on
the
charming
young
peasant
girl
in
response
to
the
pleading
of
her
eloquent
eyes
but
as
he
looked
without
speaking
and
all
the
while
the
blows
were
still
falling
she
cried
again
with
a
voice
and
gesture
of
even
more
earnest
supplication
have
pity
in
the
name
of
heaven
my
lord
tell
your
servants
to
let
the
poor
man
go
his
cries
pierce
my
ten
thousand
fiends
cried
the
grand
master
you
take
a
great
interest
in
that
rascal
over
there
my
pretty
child
is
he
your
brother
no
my
your
cousin
no
my
your
lover
my
lover
my
lord
is
laughing
at
why
not
if
it
were
so
my
sweet
girl
i
must
confess
i
should
envy
him
his
the
girl
lowered
her
eyes
i
do
not
know
him
my
lord
and
have
never
seen
him
before
without
counting
that
now
she
only
sees
him
wrong
side
before
engoulevent
ventured
to
put
in
thinking
that
it
was
a
suitable
moment
for
a
little
pleasantry
silence
sirrah
said
the
baron
sternly
then
once
more
turning
to
the
girl
with
a
smile
really
he
said
well
if
he
is
neither
a
relation
nor
a
lover
i
should
like
to
see
how
far
your
love
for
your
neighbour
will
let
you
go
come
a
bargain
pretty
girl
how
my
lord
grace
for
that
scoundrel
in
return
for
a
oh
with
all
my
heart
cried
the
young
girl
save
the
life
of
a
man
with
a
kiss
i
am
sure
that
our
good
himself
would
say
there
was
no
sin
in
and
without
waiting
for
the
baron
to
stoop
and
take
himself
what
he
had
asked
for
she
threw
off
her
placed
her
dainty
little
foot
on
the
tip
of
the
s
boot
and
taking
hold
of
the
horse
s
mane
lifted
herself
up
with
a
spring
to
the
level
of
the
face
of
the
hardy
huntsman
and
there
of
her
own
accord
offered
him
her
round
cheek
fresh
and
velvety
as
the
down
of
an
august
peach
the
lord
of
vez
had
bargained
for
one
kiss
but
he
took
two
then
true
to
his
sworn
word
he
made
a
sign
to
marcotte
to
stay
the
execution
marcotte
was
religiously
counting
his
strokes
the
twelfth
was
about
to
descend
when
he
received
the
order
to
stop
and
he
did
not
think
it
expedient
to
stay
it
from
falling
it
is
possible
that
he
also
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
give
it
the
weight
of
two
ordinary
blows
so
as
to
make
up
good
measure
and
give
a
thirteenth
in
however
that
may
be
it
is
certain
that
it
furrowed
thibault
s
shoulders
more
cruelly
than
those
that
went
before
it
must
be
added
however
that
he
was
unbound
immediately
after
meanwhile
the
baron
was
conversing
with
the
young
girl
what
is
your
name
my
pretty
one
georgine
agnelette
my
lord
my
mother
s
name
but
the
country
people
are
content
to
call
me
simply
ah
that
s
an
unlucky
name
my
child
said
the
baron
in
what
way
my
lord
asked
the
girl
because
it
makes
you
a
prey
for
the
wolf
my
beauty
and
from
what
part
of
the
country
do
you
come
agnelette
from
préciamont
my
and
you
come
alone
like
this
into
the
forest
my
child
that
s
brave
for
a
i
am
obliged
to
do
it
my
lord
for
my
mother
and
i
have
three
goats
to
so
you
come
here
to
get
grass
for
them
yes
my
and
you
are
not
afraid
young
and
pretty
as
you
are
sometimes
my
lord
i
can
not
help
and
why
do
you
tremble
well
my
lord
i
hear
so
many
tales
during
the
winter
evenings
about
that
when
i
find
myself
all
alone
among
the
trees
and
can
hear
no
sound
but
the
west
wind
and
the
branches
creaking
as
it
blows
through
them
i
feel
a
kind
of
shiver
run
through
me
and
my
hair
seems
to
stand
on
end
but
when
i
hear
your
hunting
horn
and
the
dogs
crying
then
i
feel
at
once
quite
safe
the
baron
was
pleased
beyond
measure
with
this
reply
of
the
girl
s
and
stroking
his
beard
complaisantly
he
said
well
we
give
master
wolf
a
pretty
rough
time
of
it
but
there
is
a
way
my
pretty
one
whereby
you
may
spare
yourself
all
these
fears
and
and
how
my
lord
come
in
future
to
the
castle
of
vez
no
or
any
other
kind
of
wolf
has
ever
crossed
the
moat
there
except
when
slung
by
a
cord
on
to
a
agnelette
shook
her
head
you
would
not
like
to
come
and
why
not
because
i
should
find
something
worse
there
than
the
on
hearing
this
the
baron
broke
into
a
hearty
fit
of
laughter
and
seeing
their
master
laugh
all
the
huntsmen
followed
suit
and
joined
in
the
chorus
the
fact
was
that
the
sight
of
agnelette
had
entirely
restored
the
good
humour
of
the
lord
of
vez
and
he
would
no
doubt
have
continued
for
some
time
laughing
and
talking
with
agnelette
if
marcotte
who
had
been
recalling
the
dogs
and
coupling
them
had
not
respectfully
reminded
my
lord
that
they
had
some
distance
to
go
on
their
way
back
to
the
castle
the
baron
made
a
playful
gesture
of
menace
with
his
finger
to
the
girl
and
rode
off
followed
by
his
train
agnelette
was
left
alone
with
thibault
we
have
related
what
agnelette
had
done
for
thibault
s
sake
and
also
said
that
she
was
pretty
nevertheless
for
all
that
thibault
s
first
thoughts
on
finding
himself
alone
with
the
girl
were
not
for
the
one
who
had
saved
his
life
but
were
given
up
to
hatred
and
the
contemplation
of
vengeance
thibault
as
you
see
had
since
the
morning
been
making
rapid
strides
along
the
path
of
evil
ah
if
the
devil
will
but
hear
my
prayer
this
time
he
cried
as
he
shook
his
fist
cursing
the
while
after
the
retiring
huntsmen
who
were
just
out
of
view
if
the
devil
will
but
hear
me
you
shall
be
paid
back
with
usury
for
all
you
have
made
me
suffer
this
day
that
i
oh
how
wicked
it
is
of
you
to
behave
like
that
said
agnelette
going
up
to
him
the
baron
is
a
kind
lord
very
good
to
the
poor
and
always
gently
behaved
with
quite
so
and
you
shall
see
with
what
gratitude
i
will
repay
him
for
the
blows
he
has
given
come
now
frankly
friend
confess
that
you
deserved
those
blows
said
the
girl
laughing
so
so
answered
thibault
the
baron
s
kiss
has
turned
your
head
has
it
my
pretty
agnelette
you
i
should
have
thought
would
have
been
the
last
person
to
reproach
me
with
that
kiss
monsieur
thibault
but
what
i
have
said
i
say
again
my
lord
baron
was
within
his
what
in
belabouring
me
with
blows
well
why
do
you
go
hunting
on
the
estates
of
these
great
lords
does
not
the
game
belong
to
everybody
to
the
peasant
just
as
much
as
to
the
great
lords
no
certainly
not
the
game
is
in
their
woods
it
is
fed
on
their
grass
and
you
have
no
right
to
throw
your
at
a
buck
which
belongs
to
my
lord
the
duke
of
and
who
told
you
that
i
threw
a
at
his
buck
replied
thibault
advancing
towards
agnelette
in
an
almost
threatening
manner
who
told
me
why
my
own
eyes
which
let
me
tell
you
do
not
lie
yes
i
saw
you
throw
your
when
you
were
hidden
there
behind
the
thibault
s
anger
subsided
at
once
before
the
straightforward
attitude
of
the
girl
whose
truthfulness
was
in
such
contrast
to
his
falsehood
well
after
all
he
said
supposing
a
poor
devil
does
once
in
a
way
help
himself
to
a
good
dinner
from
the
of
some
great
lord
are
you
of
the
same
mind
mademoiselle
agnelette
as
the
judges
who
say
that
a
man
ought
to
be
hanged
just
for
a
wretched
rabbit
come
now
do
you
think
god
created
that
buck
for
the
baron
more
than
for
me
god
monsieur
thibault
has
told
us
not
to
covet
other
men
s
goods
obey
the
law
of
god
and
you
will
not
find
yourself
any
the
worse
off
for
it
ah
i
see
my
pretty
agnelette
you
know
me
then
since
you
call
me
so
glibly
by
my
name
certainly
i
do
i
remember
seeing
you
at
boursonnes
on
the
day
of
the
fête
they
called
you
the
beautiful
dancer
and
stood
round
in
a
circle
to
watch
thibault
pleased
with
this
compliment
was
now
quite
disarmed
yes
yes
of
course
he
answered
i
remember
now
having
seen
you
and
i
think
we
danced
together
did
we
not
but
you
were
not
so
tall
then
as
you
are
now
that
s
why
i
did
not
recognise
you
at
first
but
i
recall
you
distinctly
now
and
i
remember
too
that
you
wore
a
pink
frock
with
a
pretty
little
white
bodice
and
that
we
danced
in
the
dairy
i
wanted
to
kiss
you
but
you
would
not
let
me
for
you
said
that
it
was
only
proper
to
kiss
one
s
and
not
one
s
you
have
a
good
memory
monsieur
thibault
and
do
you
know
agnelette
that
during
these
last
twelve
months
for
it
is
a
year
since
that
dance
you
have
not
only
grown
taller
but
grown
prettier
too
i
see
you
are
one
of
those
people
who
understand
how
to
do
two
things
at
the
girl
blushed
and
lowered
her
eyes
and
the
blush
and
the
shy
embarrassment
only
made
her
look
more
charming
still
thibault
s
eyes
were
now
turned
towards
her
with
more
marked
attention
than
before
and
in
a
voice
not
wholly
free
from
a
slight
agitation
he
asked
have
you
a
lover
agnelette
no
monsieur
thibault
she
answered
i
have
never
had
one
and
do
not
wish
to
have
and
why
is
that
is
cupid
such
a
bad
lad
that
you
are
afraid
of
him
no
not
that
but
a
lover
is
not
at
all
what
i
and
what
do
you
want
a
thibault
made
a
movement
which
agnelette
either
did
not
or
pretended
not
to
see
yes
she
repeated
a
husband
grandmother
is
old
and
infirm
and
a
lover
would
distract
my
attention
too
much
from
the
care
which
i
now
give
her
whereas
a
husband
if
i
found
a
nice
fellow
who
would
like
to
marry
me
a
husband
would
help
me
to
look
after
her
in
her
old
age
and
would
share
with
me
the
task
which
god
has
laid
upon
me
of
making
her
happy
and
comfortable
in
her
last
but
do
you
think
your
husband
said
thibault
would
be
willing
that
you
should
love
your
grandmother
more
than
you
loved
him
and
do
you
not
think
he
might
be
jealous
at
seeing
you
lavish
so
much
tenderness
upon
her
oh
replied
agnelette
with
an
adorable
smile
there
is
no
fear
of
that
for
i
will
manage
so
as
to
let
him
have
such
a
large
share
of
my
love
and
attention
that
he
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
the
kinder
and
the
more
patient
he
is
for
the
dear
old
thing
the
more
i
shall
devote
myself
to
him
the
harder
shall
i
work
that
there
may
be
nothing
wanting
to
our
little
household
you
see
me
looking
small
and
delicate
and
you
doubt
that
i
should
have
strength
for
this
but
i
have
plenty
of
spirit
and
energy
for
work
and
then
when
the
heart
gives
consent
one
can
work
day
and
night
without
fatigue
oh
how
i
should
love
the
man
who
loved
my
grandmother
i
promise
you
that
she
and
my
husband
and
i
we
should
be
three
happy
folks
you
mean
that
you
would
be
three
very
poor
folks
together
agnelette
and
do
you
think
the
loves
and
friendships
of
the
rich
are
worth
a
farthing
more
than
those
of
the
poor
at
times
when
i
have
been
loving
and
caressing
my
grandmother
monsieur
thibault
and
she
takes
me
on
her
lap
and
clasps
me
in
her
poor
weak
trembling
arms
and
puts
her
dear
old
wrinkled
face
against
mine
and
i
feel
my
cheek
wet
with
the
loving
tears
she
sheds
i
begin
to
cry
myself
and
i
tell
you
monsieur
thibault
so
soft
and
sweet
are
my
tears
that
there
is
no
woman
or
girl
be
she
queen
or
princess
who
has
ever
i
am
sure
even
in
her
happiest
days
known
such
a
real
joy
as
mine
and
yet
there
is
no
one
in
all
the
country
round
who
is
so
destitute
as
we
two
thibault
listened
to
what
agnelette
was
saying
without
answering
his
mind
was
occupied
with
many
thoughts
such
thoughts
as
are
indulged
in
by
the
ambitious
but
his
dreams
of
ambition
were
disturbed
at
moments
by
a
passing
sensation
of
depression
and
disillusionment
he
the
man
who
had
spent
hours
at
a
time
watching
the
beautiful
and
aristocratic
dames
belonging
to
the
court
of
the
duke
of
orleans
as
they
swept
up
and
down
the
wide
entrance
stairs
who
had
often
passed
whole
nights
gazing
at
the
arched
windows
of
the
keep
at
vez
when
the
whole
place
was
lit
up
for
some
festivity
he
that
same
man
now
asked
himself
if
what
he
had
so
ambitiously
desired
to
have
a
lady
of
rank
and
a
rich
dwelling
would
after
all
be
so
much
worth
possessing
as
a
thatched
roof
and
this
sweet
and
gentle
girl
called
agnelette
and
it
was
certain
that
if
this
dear
and
charming
little
woman
were
to
become
his
that
he
would
be
envied
in
turn
by
all
the
earls
and
barons
in
the
countryside
well
agnelette
said
thibault
and
suppose
a
man
like
myself
were
to
offer
himself
as
your
husband
would
you
accept
him
it
has
been
already
stated
that
thibault
was
a
handsome
young
fellow
with
fine
eyes
and
black
hair
and
that
his
travels
had
left
him
something
better
than
a
mere
workman
and
it
must
further
be
borne
in
mind
that
we
readily
become
attached
to
those
on
whom
we
have
conferred
a
benefit
and
agnelette
had
in
all
probability
saved
thibault
s
life
for
under
such
strokes
as
marcotte
s
the
victim
would
certainly
have
been
dead
before
the
had
been
given
yes
she
said
if
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
my
grandmother
thibault
took
hold
of
her
hand
well
then
agnelette
he
said
we
will
speak
again
about
this
dear
child
and
that
as
soon
as
may
whenever
you
like
monsieur
and
you
will
promise
faithfully
to
love
me
if
i
marry
you
agnelette
do
you
think
i
should
love
any
man
besides
my
husband
never
mind
i
want
you
just
to
take
a
little
oath
something
of
this
kind
for
instance
monsieur
thibault
i
swear
that
i
will
never
love
anyone
but
what
need
is
there
to
swear
the
promise
of
an
honest
girl
should
be
sufficient
for
an
honest
and
when
shall
we
have
the
wedding
agnelette
and
in
saying
this
thibault
tried
to
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
but
agnelette
gently
disengaged
herself
come
and
see
my
grandmother
she
said
it
is
for
her
to
decide
about
it
you
must
content
yourself
this
evening
with
helping
me
up
with
my
load
of
heath
for
it
is
getting
late
and
it
is
nearly
three
miles
from
here
to
so
thibault
helped
her
as
desired
and
then
accompanied
her
on
her
way
home
as
far
as
the
of
billemont
that
is
until
they
came
in
sight
of
the
village
steeple
before
parting
he
so
begged
of
pretty
agnelette
to
give
him
one
kiss
as
an
earnest
of
his
future
happiness
that
at
last
she
consented
and
then
far
more
agitated
by
this
one
kiss
than
she
had
been
by
the
baron
s
double
embrace
agnelette
hastened
on
her
way
in
spite
of
the
load
which
she
was
carrying
on
her
head
and
which
seemed
far
too
heavy
for
so
slender
and
delicate
a
creature
thibault
stood
for
some
time
looking
after
her
as
she
walked
away
across
the
moor
all
the
flexibility
and
grace
of
her
youthful
figure
were
brought
into
relief
as
the
girl
lifted
her
pretty
rounded
arms
to
support
the
burden
upon
her
head
and
thus
silhouetted
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
sky
she
made
a
delightful
picture
at
last
having
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
village
the
land
dipping
at
that
point
she
suddenly
disappeared
passing
out
of
sight
of
thibault
s
admiring
eyes
he
gave
a
sigh
and
stood
still
plunged
in
thought
but
it
was
not
the
satisfaction
of
thinking
that
this
sweet
and
good
young
creature
might
one
day
be
his
that
had
caused
his
sigh
quite
the
contrary
he
had
wished
for
agnelette
because
agnelette
was
young
and
pretty
and
because
it
was
part
of
his
unfortunate
disposition
to
long
for
everything
that
belonged
or
might
belong
to
another
his
desire
to
possess
agnelette
had
been
quickened
by
the
innocent
frankness
with
which
she
had
talked
to
him
but
it
had
been
a
matter
of
fancy
rather
than
of
any
deeper
feeling
of
the
mind
and
not
of
the
heart
for
thibault
was
incapable
of
loving
as
a
man
ought
to
love
who
being
poor
himself
loves
a
poor
girl
in
such
a
case
there
should
be
no
thought
no
ambition
on
his
part
beyond
the
wish
that
his
love
may
be
returned
but
it
was
not
so
with
thibault
on
the
contrary
i
repeat
the
farther
he
walked
away
from
agnelette
leaving
it
would
seem
his
good
genius
farther
behind
him
with
every
step
the
more
urgently
did
his
envious
longings
begin
again
as
usual
to
torment
his
soul
it
was
dark
when
he
reached
home
chapter
iv
the
black
wolf
thibault
s
first
thought
was
to
get
himself
some
supper
for
he
was
terribly
tired
the
past
day
had
been
an
eventful
one
for
him
and
certain
things
which
had
happened
to
him
had
evidently
been
calculated
to
produce
a
craving
for
food
the
supper
it
must
be
said
was
not
quite
such
a
savoury
one
as
he
had
promised
himself
when
starting
to
kill
the
buck
but
the
animal
as
we
know
had
not
been
killed
by
thibault
and
the
ferocious
hunger
which
now
consumed
him
made
his
black
bread
taste
almost
as
delicious
as
venison
he
had
hardly
however
begun
his
frugal
repast
when
he
became
conscious
that
his
goat
of
which
i
think
we
have
already
spoken
was
uttering
the
most
plaintive
bleatings
thinking
that
she
too
was
in
want
of
her
supper
he
went
into
the
for
some
fresh
grass
which
he
then
carried
to
her
but
as
he
opened
the
little
door
of
the
shed
out
she
rushed
with
such
precipitancy
that
she
nearly
knocked
thibault
over
and
without
stopping
to
take
the
provender
he
had
brought
her
ran
towards
the
house
thibault
threw
down
the
bundle
of
grass
and
went
after
her
with
the
intention
of
her
in
her
proper
place
but
he
found
that
this
was
more
than
he
was
able
to
do
he
had
to
use
all
his
force
to
get
her
along
for
the
goat
with
all
the
strength
of
which
a
beast
of
her
kind
is
capable
resisted
all
his
efforts
to
drag
her
back
by
the
horns
arching
her
back
and
stubbornly
refusing
to
move
at
last
however
being
vanquished
in
the
struggle
it
ended
by
the
goat
being
once
more
shut
up
in
her
shed
but
in
spite
of
the
plentiful
supper
which
thibault
left
her
with
she
continued
to
utter
the
most
lamentable
cries
perplexed
and
cross
at
the
same
time
the
again
rose
from
his
supper
and
went
to
the
shed
this
time
opening
the
door
so
cautiously
that
the
goat
could
not
escape
once
inside
he
began
feeling
about
with
his
hands
in
all
the
nooks
and
corners
to
try
and
discover
the
cause
of
her
alarm
suddenly
his
fingers
came
in
contact
with
the
warm
thick
coat
of
some
other
animal
thibault
was
not
a
coward
far
from
it
none
the
less
he
drew
back
hastily
he
returned
to
the
house
and
got
a
light
but
it
almost
fell
from
his
hand
when
on
the
shed
he
recognised
in
the
animal
that
had
so
frightened
the
goat
the
buck
of
the
lord
of
vez
the
same
buck
that
he
had
followed
had
failed
to
kill
that
he
had
prayed
for
in
the
devil
s
name
if
he
could
not
have
it
in
god
s
the
same
that
had
thrown
the
hounds
out
the
very
same
in
short
which
had
cost
him
such
hard
blows
thibault
after
assuring
himself
that
the
door
was
fastened
went
gently
up
to
the
animal
the
poor
thing
was
either
so
tired
or
so
tame
that
it
did
not
make
the
slightest
attempt
to
move
but
merely
gazed
out
at
thibault
with
its
large
dark
velvety
eyes
rendered
more
appealing
than
ever
by
the
fear
which
agitated
it
i
must
have
left
the
door
open
muttered
the
to
himself
and
the
creature
not
knowing
where
to
hide
itself
must
have
taken
refuge
but
on
thinking
further
over
the
matter
it
came
back
to
him
that
when
he
had
gone
to
open
the
door
only
ten
minutes
before
for
the
first
time
he
had
found
the
wooden
bolt
pushed
so
firmly
into
the
staple
that
he
had
had
to
get
a
stone
to
hammer
it
back
and
then
besides
the
goat
which
as
we
have
seen
did
not
at
all
relish
the
society
of
the
would
certainly
have
run
out
of
the
shed
before
if
the
door
had
been
open
what
was
however
still
more
surprising
was
that
thibault
looking
more
closely
at
the
buck
saw
that
it
had
been
fastened
up
to
the
rack
by
a
cord
thibault
as
we
have
said
was
no
coward
but
now
a
cold
sweat
began
to
break
out
in
large
drops
on
his
brow
a
curious
kind
of
a
shiver
ran
through
his
body
and
his
teeth
chattered
violently
he
went
out
of
the
shed
shutting
the
door
after
him
and
began
looking
for
his
goat
which
had
taken
advantage
of
the
moment
when
the
had
gone
to
fetch
a
light
and
ran
again
into
the
house
where
she
was
now
lying
beside
the
hearth
having
evidently
quite
made
up
her
mind
this
time
not
to
forsake
a
resting
place
which
for
that
night
at
least
she
found
preferable
to
her
usual
abode
thibault
had
a
perfect
remembrance
of
the
unholy
invocation
he
had
addressed
to
satan
and
although
his
prayer
had
been
miraculously
answered
he
still
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
there
was
any
diabolic
intervention
in
the
matter
as
the
idea
however
of
being
under
the
protection
of
the
spirit
of
darkness
filled
him
with
an
instinctive
fear
he
tried
to
pray
but
when
he
wished
to
raise
his
hand
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
his
arm
refused
to
bend
and
although
up
to
that
time
he
had
never
missed
a
day
saying
his
he
could
not
remember
a
single
word
of
it
these
fruitless
efforts
were
accompanied
by
a
terrible
turmoil
in
poor
thibault
s
brain
evil
thoughts
came
rushing
in
upon
him
and
he
seemed
to
hear
them
whispering
all
around
him
as
one
hears
the
murmur
of
the
rising
tide
or
the
laughing
of
the
winter
wind
through
the
leafless
branches
of
the
trees
after
all
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
sat
pale
and
staring
before
him
the
buck
is
a
fine
windfall
whether
it
comes
from
god
or
the
devil
and
i
should
be
a
fool
not
to
profit
by
it
if
i
am
afraid
of
it
as
being
food
sent
from
the
nether
regions
i
am
in
no
way
forced
to
eat
it
and
what
is
more
i
could
not
eat
it
alone
and
if
i
asked
anyone
to
partake
of
it
with
me
i
should
be
betrayed
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
take
the
live
beast
over
to
the
nunnery
of
where
it
will
serve
as
a
pet
for
the
nuns
and
where
the
abbess
will
give
me
a
good
round
sum
for
it
the
atmosphere
of
that
holy
place
will
drive
the
evil
out
of
it
and
i
shall
run
no
risk
to
my
soul
in
taking
a
handful
of
consecrated
crown
pieces
what
days
of
sweating
over
my
work
and
turning
my
auger
it
would
take
to
earn
even
the
quarter
of
what
i
shall
get
by
just
leading
the
beast
to
its
new
fold
the
devil
who
helps
one
is
certainly
better
worth
than
the
angel
who
forsakes
one
if
my
lord
satan
wants
to
go
too
far
with
me
it
will
then
be
time
enough
to
free
myself
from
his
claws
bless
me
i
am
not
a
child
nor
a
young
lamb
like
georgine
and
i
am
able
to
walk
straight
in
front
of
me
and
go
where
i
he
had
forgotten
unhappy
man
as
he
boasted
of
being
able
to
go
where
and
how
he
liked
that
only
five
minutes
before
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
lift
his
hand
to
his
head
thibault
had
such
convincing
and
excellent
reasons
ready
to
hand
that
he
quite
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
the
buck
come
whence
it
might
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
decide
that
the
money
he
received
for
it
should
be
devoted
to
buying
a
wedding
dress
for
his
betrothed
for
strange
to
say
by
some
freak
of
memory
his
thoughts
would
keep
returning
towards
agnelette
and
he
seemed
to
see
her
clad
in
a
long
white
dress
with
a
crown
of
white
lilies
on
her
head
and
a
long
veil
if
he
said
to
himself
he
could
have
such
a
charming
guardian
angel
in
his
house
no
devil
however
strong
and
cunning
he
might
be
would
ever
dare
to
cross
the
threshold
so
he
went
on
there
is
always
that
remedy
at
hand
and
if
my
lord
satan
begins
to
be
too
troublesome
i
shall
be
off
to
the
grandmother
to
ask
for
agnelette
i
shall
marry
her
and
if
i
can
not
remember
my
prayers
or
am
unable
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
there
will
be
a
dear
pretty
little
woman
who
has
had
no
traffic
with
satan
who
will
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
for
having
more
or
less
himself
with
the
idea
of
this
compromise
thibault
in
order
that
the
buck
should
not
run
down
in
value
and
might
be
as
fine
an
animal
as
possible
to
offer
to
the
holy
ladies
to
whom
he
calculated
to
sell
it
went
and
filled
the
rack
with
fodder
and
looked
to
see
that
the
litter
was
soft
and
thick
enough
for
the
buck
to
rest
fully
at
its
ease
the
remainder
of
the
night
passed
without
further
incident
and
without
even
a
bad
dream
the
next
morning
my
lord
baron
again
went
hunting
but
this
time
it
was
not
a
timid
deer
that
headed
the
hounds
but
the
wolf
which
marcotte
had
tracked
the
day
before
and
had
again
that
morning
traced
to
his
lair
and
this
wolf
was
a
genuine
wolf
and
no
mistake
it
must
have
seen
many
and
many
a
year
although
those
who
had
that
morning
caught
sight
of
it
while
on
its
track
had
noted
with
astonishment
that
it
was
black
all
over
black
or
grey
however
it
was
a
bold
and
enterprising
beast
and
promised
some
rough
work
to
the
baron
and
his
huntsmen
first
started
near
vertefeuille
in
the
dargent
covert
it
had
made
over
the
plain
of
meutard
leaving
fleury
and
dampleux
to
the
left
crossed
the
road
to
and
finally
begun
to
run
cunning
in
the
ivors
coppices
then
instead
of
continuing
in
the
same
direction
it
doubled
returning
along
the
same
track
it
had
come
and
so
exactly
retracing
its
own
steps
that
the
baron
as
he
galloped
along
could
actually
distinguish
the
prints
left
by
his
horse
s
hoofs
that
same
morning
back
again
in
the
district
of
he
ranged
the
country
leading
the
hunt
right
to
the
very
spot
where
the
of
the
previous
day
had
had
their
start
the
vicinity
of
the
s
hut
thibault
we
know
had
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
in
regard
to
certain
matters
and
as
he
intended
going
over
to
see
agnelette
in
the
evening
he
had
started
work
early
you
will
naturally
ask
why
instead
of
sitting
down
to
a
work
which
brought
in
so
little
as
he
himself
acknowledged
thibault
did
not
start
off
at
once
to
take
his
buck
to
the
ladies
of
thibault
took
very
good
care
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
the
day
was
not
the
time
to
be
leading
a
buck
through
the
forest
of
the
first
keeper
he
met
would
have
stopped
him
and
what
explanation
could
he
have
given
no
thibault
had
arranged
in
his
own
mind
to
leave
home
one
evening
about
dusk
to
follow
the
road
to
the
right
then
go
down
the
sandpit
lane
which
led
into
the
chemin
du
pendu
and
he
would
then
be
on
the
common
of
only
a
hundred
paces
or
so
from
the
convent
thibault
no
sooner
caught
the
first
sound
of
the
horn
and
the
dogs
than
he
immediately
gathered
together
a
huge
bundle
of
dried
heather
which
he
hastily
piled
up
in
front
of
the
shed
where
his
prisoner
was
confined
so
as
to
hide
the
door
in
case
the
huntsmen
and
their
master
should
halt
in
front
of
his
hut
as
they
had
the
day
before
he
then
sat
down
again
to
his
work
applying
to
it
an
energy
unknown
even
to
himself
before
bending
over
the
shoe
he
was
making
with
an
intentness
which
prevented
him
from
even
lifting
his
eyes
all
at
once
he
thought
he
detected
a
sound
like
something
scratching
at
the
door
he
was
just
going
through
from
his
to
open
it
when
the
door
fell
back
and
to
thibault
s
great
astonishment
an
immense
black
wolf
entered
the
room
walking
on
its
hind
legs
on
reaching
the
middle
of
the
floor
it
sat
down
after
the
fashion
of
wolves
and
looked
hard
and
fixedly
at
the
thibault
seized
a
hatchet
which
was
within
reach
and
in
order
to
give
a
fit
reception
to
his
strange
visitor
and
to
terrify
him
he
flourished
the
weapon
above
his
head
a
curious
mocking
expression
passed
over
the
face
of
the
wolf
and
then
it
began
to
laugh
it
was
the
first
time
that
thibault
had
ever
heard
a
wolf
laugh
he
had
often
heard
tell
that
wolves
barked
like
dogs
but
never
that
they
laughed
like
human
beings
and
what
a
laugh
it
was
if
a
man
had
laughed
such
a
laugh
thibault
would
verily
and
indeed
have
been
scared
out
of
his
wits
he
brought
his
lifted
arm
down
again
by
my
lord
of
the
cloven
foot
said
the
wolf
in
a
full
and
sonorous
voice
you
are
a
fine
fellow
at
your
request
i
send
you
the
finest
buck
from
his
royal
highness
s
forests
and
in
return
you
want
to
split
my
head
open
with
your
hatchet
human
gratitude
is
worthy
to
rank
with
that
of
on
hearing
a
voice
exactly
like
his
own
coming
forth
from
a
beast
s
mouth
thibault
s
knees
began
to
shake
under
him
and
the
hatchet
fell
out
of
his
hand
now
then
continued
the
wolf
let
us
be
sensible
and
talk
together
like
two
good
friends
yesterday
you
wanted
the
baron
s
buck
and
i
led
it
myself
into
your
shed
and
for
fear
it
should
escape
i
tied
it
up
myself
to
the
rack
and
for
all
this
you
take
your
hatchet
to
me
how
should
i
know
who
you
were
asked
thibault
i
see
you
did
not
recognise
me
a
nice
sort
of
excuse
to
well
i
ask
you
was
it
likely
i
should
take
you
for
a
friend
under
that
ugly
coat
ugly
coat
indeed
said
the
wolf
licking
his
fur
with
a
long
tongue
as
red
as
blood
confound
you
you
are
hard
to
please
however
it
s
not
a
matter
of
my
coat
what
i
want
to
know
is
are
you
willing
to
make
me
some
return
for
the
service
i
have
done
you
certainly
said
the
feeling
rather
uncomfortable
but
i
ought
to
know
what
your
demands
are
what
is
it
what
do
you
want
speak
first
of
all
and
above
all
things
i
should
like
a
glass
of
water
for
those
confounded
dogs
have
run
me
until
i
am
out
of
you
shall
have
it
in
a
moment
my
lord
and
thibault
ran
and
fetched
a
bowl
of
fresh
clear
water
from
a
brook
which
ran
some
ten
paces
from
the
hut
the
eager
readiness
with
which
he
complied
with
the
wolf
s
request
betrayed
his
feeling
of
relief
at
getting
out
of
the
bargain
so
cheaply
as
he
placed
the
bowl
in
front
of
the
wolf
he
made
the
animal
a
low
bow
the
wolf
lapped
up
the
contents
with
evident
delight
and
then
stretched
himself
on
the
floor
with
his
paws
straight
out
in
front
of
him
looking
like
a
sphinx
now
he
said
listen
to
there
is
something
else
you
wish
me
to
do
asked
thibault
inwardly
quaking
yes
a
very
urgent
something
replied
the
wolf
do
you
hear
the
baying
of
the
dogs
indeed
i
do
they
are
coming
nearer
and
nearer
and
in
five
minutes
they
will
be
and
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
get
me
out
of
their
get
you
out
of
their
way
and
how
cried
thibault
who
but
too
well
remembered
what
it
had
cost
him
to
meddle
with
the
baron
s
hunting
the
day
before
look
about
you
think
invent
some
way
of
delivering
me
the
baron
s
dogs
are
rough
customers
to
deal
with
and
you
are
asking
neither
more
nor
less
than
that
i
should
save
your
life
for
i
warn
you
if
they
once
get
hold
of
you
and
they
will
probably
scent
you
out
they
will
make
short
work
of
pulling
you
to
pieces
and
now
supposing
i
spare
you
this
disagreeable
business
continued
thibault
who
imagined
that
he
had
now
got
the
upper
hand
what
will
you
do
for
me
in
return
do
for
you
in
return
said
the
wolf
and
how
about
the
buck
and
how
about
the
bowl
of
water
said
thibault
we
are
quits
there
my
good
sir
let
us
start
a
fresh
business
altogether
if
you
are
agreeable
to
it
i
am
quite
let
it
be
so
then
tell
me
quickly
what
you
want
of
there
are
folks
proceeded
thibault
who
might
take
advantage
of
the
position
you
are
now
in
and
ask
for
all
kinds
of
extravagant
things
riches
power
titles
and
what
not
but
i
am
not
going
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
yesterday
i
wanted
the
buck
and
you
gave
it
me
it
is
true
i
shall
want
something
else
for
some
time
past
i
have
been
possessed
by
a
kind
of
mania
and
i
do
nothing
but
wish
first
for
one
thing
and
then
for
another
and
you
will
not
always
be
able
to
spare
time
to
listen
to
my
demands
so
what
i
ask
for
is
that
as
you
are
the
devil
in
person
or
someone
very
like
it
you
will
grant
me
the
fulfilment
of
every
wish
i
may
have
from
this
day
the
wolf
put
on
a
mocking
expression
of
countenance
is
that
all
he
said
your
peroration
does
not
accord
very
well
with
your
oh
continued
thibault
my
wishes
are
honest
and
moderate
ones
and
such
as
become
a
poor
peasant
like
myself
i
want
just
a
little
corner
of
ground
and
a
few
timbers
and
planks
that
s
all
that
a
man
of
my
sort
can
possibly
i
should
have
the
greatest
pleasure
in
doing
what
you
ask
said
the
wolf
but
it
is
simply
impossible
you
then
i
am
afraid
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
put
up
with
what
the
dogs
may
do
to
you
think
so
and
you
suppose
i
have
need
of
your
help
and
so
you
can
ask
what
you
please
i
do
not
suppose
it
i
am
sure
of
indeed
well
then
look
where
asked
thibault
look
at
the
spot
where
i
was
said
the
wolf
thibault
drew
back
in
horror
the
place
where
the
wolf
had
been
lying
was
empty
the
wolf
had
disappeared
where
or
how
it
was
impossible
to
say
the
room
was
intact
there
was
not
a
hole
in
the
roof
large
enough
to
let
a
needle
through
nor
a
crack
in
the
floor
through
which
a
drop
of
water
could
have
filtered
well
do
you
still
think
that
i
require
your
assistance
to
get
out
of
trouble
said
the
wolf
where
the
devil
are
you
if
you
put
a
question
to
me
in
my
real
name
said
the
wolf
with
a
sneer
in
his
voice
i
shall
be
obliged
to
answer
you
i
am
still
in
the
same
but
i
can
no
longer
see
you
simply
because
i
am
but
the
dogs
the
huntsmen
the
baron
will
come
in
here
after
you
no
doubt
they
will
but
they
will
not
find
but
if
they
do
not
find
you
they
will
set
upon
as
they
did
yesterday
only
yesterday
you
were
sentenced
to
strokes
of
the
strap
for
having
carried
off
the
buck
you
will
be
sentenced
to
for
having
hidden
the
wolf
and
agnelette
will
not
be
on
the
spot
to
buy
you
off
with
a
phew
what
am
i
to
do
let
the
buck
loose
the
dogs
will
mistake
the
scent
and
they
will
get
the
blows
instead
of
but
is
it
likely
such
trained
hounds
will
follow
the
scent
of
a
deer
in
mistake
for
that
of
a
wolf
you
can
leave
that
to
me
replied
the
voice
only
do
not
lose
any
time
or
the
dogs
will
be
here
before
you
have
reached
the
shed
and
that
would
make
matters
unpleasant
not
for
me
whom
they
would
not
find
but
for
you
whom
they
thibault
did
not
wait
to
be
warned
a
second
time
but
was
off
like
a
shot
to
the
shed
he
unfastened
the
buck
which
as
if
propelled
by
some
hidden
force
leapt
from
the
house
ran
round
it
crossing
the
track
of
the
wolf
and
plunged
into
the
baisemont
coppice
the
dogs
were
within
a
hundred
paces
of
the
hut
thibault
heard
them
with
trepidation
the
whole
pack
came
full
force
against
the
door
one
hound
after
the
other
then
all
at
once
two
or
three
gave
cry
and
went
off
in
the
direction
of
baisemont
the
rest
of
the
hounds
after
them
the
dogs
were
on
the
wrong
scent
they
were
on
the
scent
of
the
buck
and
had
abandoned
that
of
the
wolf
thibault
gave
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
he
watched
the
hunt
gradually
disappearing
in
the
distance
and
went
back
to
his
room
to
the
full
and
joyous
notes
of
the
baron
s
horn
he
found
the
wolf
lying
composedly
on
the
same
spot
as
before
but
how
it
had
found
its
way
in
again
was
quite
as
impossible
to
discover
as
how
it
had
found
its
way
out
chapter
v
the
pact
with
satan
thibault
stopped
short
on
the
threshold
overcome
with
astonishment
at
this
i
was
saying
began
the
wolf
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
interrupt
the
conversation
that
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
grant
you
the
accomplishment
of
all
the
wishes
you
may
have
in
future
for
your
own
comfort
and
then
i
am
to
expect
nothing
from
you
not
so
for
the
ill
you
wish
your
neighbour
can
be
carried
out
with
my
and
pray
what
good
would
that
do
me
personally
you
fool
has
not
a
moralist
said
there
is
always
something
sweet
to
us
in
the
misfortune
of
our
friends
even
the
was
it
a
wolf
said
that
i
did
not
know
wolves
could
boast
of
moralists
among
their
no
it
was
not
a
wolf
it
was
a
and
was
the
man
hanged
on
the
contrary
he
was
made
governor
of
part
of
poitou
there
are
to
be
sure
a
good
many
wolves
in
that
province
well
then
if
there
is
something
pleasant
in
the
misfortune
of
our
best
friend
can
not
you
understand
what
a
subject
of
rejoicing
the
misfortune
of
our
worst
enemy
must
be
there
is
some
truth
in
that
certainly
said
thibault
without
taking
into
consideration
that
there
is
always
an
opportunity
of
profiting
by
our
neighbour
s
calamity
whether
he
be
friend
or
thibault
paused
for
a
minute
or
two
to
consider
before
he
answered
by
my
faith
you
are
right
there
friend
wolf
and
suppose
then
you
do
me
this
service
what
shall
you
expect
in
exchange
i
suppose
it
will
have
to
be
a
case
of
give
and
take
eh
certainly
every
time
that
you
express
a
wish
that
is
not
to
your
own
immediate
advantage
you
will
have
to
repay
me
with
a
small
portion
of
your
thibault
drew
back
with
an
exclamation
of
fear
oh
do
not
be
alarmed
i
shall
not
demand
a
pound
of
flesh
as
a
certain
jew
of
my
acquaintance
did
from
his
what
is
it
then
you
ask
of
me
for
the
fulfilment
of
your
first
wish
one
of
your
hairs
two
hairs
for
the
second
wish
four
for
the
third
and
so
on
doubling
the
number
each
thibault
broke
into
a
laugh
if
that
is
all
you
require
master
wolf
i
accept
on
the
spot
and
i
shall
try
to
start
with
such
a
comprehensive
wish
that
i
shall
never
need
to
wear
a
wig
so
let
it
be
agreed
between
us
and
thibault
held
out
his
hand
the
black
wolf
lifted
his
paw
but
he
kept
it
raised
well
said
thibault
i
was
only
thinking
replied
the
wolf
that
i
have
rather
sharp
claws
and
without
wishing
to
do
so
i
might
hurt
you
badly
but
i
see
a
way
whereby
to
clinch
the
bargain
without
any
damage
done
to
you
you
have
a
silver
ring
i
have
a
gold
one
let
us
exchange
the
barter
will
be
to
your
advantage
as
you
and
the
wolf
held
out
its
paw
thibault
saw
a
ring
of
the
purest
gold
shining
under
the
fur
of
what
corresponded
to
the
ring
finger
and
accepted
the
bargain
without
hesitation
the
respective
rings
then
changed
ownership
good
said
the
wolf
now
we
two
are
you
mean
betrothed
master
wolf
put
in
thibault
plague
upon
you
you
go
too
we
shall
see
about
that
master
thibault
and
now
you
go
back
to
your
work
and
i
ll
go
back
to
my
lord
till
we
meet
again
master
the
wolf
had
hardly
uttered
these
last
words
on
which
it
had
laid
an
unmistakeable
emphasis
ere
it
disappeared
like
a
pinch
of
lighted
and
like
the
left
behind
a
strong
smell
of
sulphur
thibault
again
stood
for
a
moment
dumbfounded
he
had
not
yet
grown
accustomed
to
this
manner
of
making
one
s
exit
to
use
a
theatrical
expression
he
looked
round
him
on
every
side
but
the
wolf
was
not
there
at
first
he
thought
the
whole
thing
must
have
been
a
dream
but
looking
down
he
saw
the
devil
s
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
his
right
hand
he
drew
it
off
and
examined
it
he
saw
a
monogram
engraved
on
the
inner
side
and
looking
more
closely
perceived
that
it
was
formed
of
two
letters
and
ah
he
exclaimed
in
a
cold
sweat
thibault
and
satan
the
family
names
of
the
two
contracting
parties
so
much
the
worse
for
me
but
when
one
gives
oneself
to
the
devil
one
has
to
do
it
without
and
thibault
began
humming
a
song
trying
to
drown
his
thoughts
but
his
voice
filled
him
with
fear
for
there
was
a
new
and
curious
sound
in
it
even
to
his
own
ears
so
he
fell
silent
and
went
back
to
his
work
as
a
distraction
he
had
only
just
begun
however
to
shape
his
wooden
shoe
when
some
distance
off
from
the
direction
of
baisemont
he
again
heard
the
baying
of
the
hounds
and
the
notes
of
the
baron
s
horn
thibault
left
off
working
to
listen
to
these
various
sounds
ah
my
fine
lord
you
may
chase
your
wolf
as
long
as
you
like
but
i
can
tell
you
you
won
t
get
this
one
s
paw
to
nail
up
over
the
door
of
your
castle
what
a
lucky
beggar
i
am
here
am
i
almost
as
good
as
a
magician
and
while
you
ride
on
suspecting
nothing
my
brave
dispenser
of
blows
i
have
but
to
say
the
word
and
a
spell
will
be
cast
over
you
whereby
i
shall
be
amply
and
in
thinking
thus
thibault
suddenly
paused
and
after
all
he
went
on
why
shouldn
t
i
revenge
myself
on
this
damned
baron
and
master
marcotte
pshaw
with
only
a
hair
at
stake
i
may
well
gratify
myself
on
this
and
so
saying
thibault
passed
his
hand
through
the
thick
silky
hair
which
covered
his
head
like
a
lion
s
mane
i
shall
have
plenty
of
hairs
left
to
lose
he
continued
why
bother
about
one
and
besides
it
will
be
an
opportunity
for
seeing
whether
my
friend
the
devil
has
been
playing
false
with
me
or
not
very
well
then
i
wish
a
serious
accident
to
befall
the
baron
and
as
for
that
of
a
marcotte
who
laid
on
to
me
so
roughly
yesterday
it
is
only
fair
that
something
as
bad
again
should
happen
to
while
expressing
this
double
wish
thibault
felt
anxious
and
agitated
to
the
last
degree
for
in
spite
of
what
he
had
already
seen
of
the
wolf
s
power
he
still
feared
the
devil
might
only
have
been
playing
on
his
credulity
after
uttering
his
wish
he
tried
in
vain
to
return
to
his
work
he
took
hold
of
his
parer
wrong
side
up
and
took
the
skin
off
his
fingers
and
still
going
on
with
his
paring
he
spoilt
a
pair
of
shoes
worth
a
good
twelve
sous
as
he
was
lamenting
over
this
misfortune
and
wiping
the
blood
off
his
hand
he
heard
a
great
commotion
in
the
direction
of
the
valley
he
ran
into
the
chrétiennelle
road
and
saw
a
number
of
men
walking
slowly
two
and
two
in
his
direction
these
men
were
the
prickers
and
kennelmen
of
the
lord
of
vez
the
road
they
were
traversing
was
about
two
miles
long
so
that
it
was
some
time
before
thibault
could
distinguish
what
the
men
were
doing
who
were
walking
as
slowly
and
solemnly
as
if
forming
part
of
a
funeral
procession
when
however
they
got
to
within
five
hundred
paces
of
him
he
saw
that
they
were
carrying
two
rough
litters
on
which
were
stretched
two
lifeless
bodies
those
of
the
baron
and
of
marcotte
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
over
thibault
s
forehead
ah
he
exclaimed
what
do
i
see
here
what
had
happened
was
this
thibault
s
expedient
for
putting
the
dogs
on
the
wrong
scent
had
succeeded
and
all
had
gone
well
as
long
as
the
buck
remained
in
covert
but
it
doubled
when
near
marolle
and
while
crossing
the
heath
passed
within
ten
paces
of
the
baron
the
latter
thought
at
first
that
the
animal
had
been
startled
by
hearing
the
hounds
and
was
trying
to
hide
itself
but
at
that
moment
not
more
than
a
hundred
paces
behind
him
the
whole
pack
of
hounds
appeared
forty
dogs
running
yelping
yelling
crying
some
in
a
deep
bass
like
great
cathedral
bells
others
with
the
full
sound
of
a
gong
and
again
others
in
a
falsetto
key
like
clarionettes
out
of
tune
all
giving
cry
at
the
top
of
their
voices
as
eagerly
and
merrily
as
if
they
had
never
followed
the
scent
of
any
other
beast
then
the
baron
gave
way
to
one
of
his
wild
fits
of
rage
fits
only
worthy
of
polichinello
tearing
a
passion
to
tatters
in
a
he
did
not
shout
he
yelled
he
did
not
swear
he
cursed
not
satisfied
with
lashing
his
dogs
he
rode
them
down
trampling
them
beneath
his
horse
s
hoofs
flinging
himself
about
in
his
saddle
like
a
devil
in
a
stoup
of
holy
water
all
his
maledictions
were
hurled
at
his
chief
pricker
whom
he
held
responsible
for
the
stupid
blunder
that
had
occurred
this
time
marcotte
had
not
a
word
to
say
either
in
explanation
or
excuse
and
the
poor
man
was
terribly
ashamed
of
the
mistake
his
hounds
had
made
and
mighty
uneasy
at
the
towering
passion
into
which
it
had
thrown
my
lord
he
made
up
his
mind
therefore
to
do
everything
in
the
power
of
man
if
possible
more
to
repair
the
one
and
calm
the
other
and
so
started
off
at
full
gallop
dashing
among
the
trees
and
over
the
brushwood
crying
out
at
the
top
of
his
voice
while
he
slashed
right
and
left
with
such
vigour
that
every
stroke
of
his
whip
cut
into
the
flesh
of
the
poor
animals
back
dogs
back
but
in
vain
he
rode
and
whipped
and
called
aloud
the
dogs
only
seemed
to
become
more
wildly
anxious
to
follow
up
the
new
found
scent
as
if
they
recognised
the
buck
of
the
day
before
and
were
determined
that
their
wounded
should
have
its
revenge
then
marcotte
grew
desperate
and
determined
on
the
only
course
that
seemed
left
the
river
ourcq
was
close
by
the
dogs
were
already
on
the
point
of
crossing
the
water
and
the
one
chance
of
breaking
up
the
pack
was
to
get
across
himself
and
whip
back
the
dogs
as
they
began
to
climb
the
opposite
bank
he
spurred
his
horse
in
the
direction
of
the
river
and
leaped
with
it
into
the
very
middle
of
the
stream
both
horse
and
rider
arriving
safely
in
the
water
but
unfortunately
as
we
have
already
mentioned
the
river
just
at
this
time
was
terribly
swollen
with
the
rains
the
horse
was
unable
to
stand
against
the
violence
of
the
current
and
after
being
swept
round
two
or
three
times
finally
disappeared
seeing
that
it
was
useless
trying
to
save
his
horse
marcotte
endeavoured
to
disengage
himself
but
his
feet
were
so
firmly
fixed
in
the
stirrups
that
he
could
not
draw
them
out
and
three
seconds
after
his
horse
had
disappeared
marcotte
himself
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
meanwhile
the
baron
with
the
remainder
of
the
huntsmen
had
ridden
up
to
the
water
s
edge
and
his
anger
was
in
an
instant
converted
into
grief
and
alarm
as
soon
as
he
became
aware
of
the
perilous
situation
of
his
pricker
for
the
lord
of
vez
had
a
sincere
love
towards
those
who
ministered
to
his
pleasure
whether
man
or
beast
in
a
loud
voice
he
shouted
to
his
followers
by
all
the
powers
of
hell
save
marcotte
five
and
twenty
louis
fifty
louis
a
hundred
louis
to
anyone
who
will
save
him
and
men
and
horses
like
so
many
startled
frogs
leaped
into
the
water
vying
with
each
other
who
should
be
first
the
baron
was
for
riding
into
the
river
himself
but
his
henchmen
held
him
back
and
so
anxious
were
they
to
prevent
the
worthy
baron
from
carrying
out
his
heroic
intention
that
their
affection
for
their
master
was
fatal
to
the
poor
pricker
for
one
moment
he
was
forgotten
but
that
last
moment
meant
his
death
he
appeared
once
more
above
the
surface
just
where
the
river
makes
a
bend
he
was
seen
to
battle
against
the
water
and
his
face
for
an
instant
rose
into
view
as
with
one
last
cry
he
called
to
his
hounds
back
dogs
back
but
the
water
again
closed
over
him
stifling
the
last
syllable
of
the
last
word
and
it
was
not
till
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
that
his
body
was
found
lying
on
a
little
beach
of
sand
on
to
which
the
current
had
washed
him
marcotte
was
dead
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
this
accident
was
disastrous
in
its
effect
on
the
lord
of
vez
being
the
noble
lord
he
was
he
had
somewhat
of
a
liking
for
good
wine
and
this
predisposed
him
ever
so
little
to
apoplexy
and
now
as
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
corpse
of
his
good
servitor
the
emotion
was
so
great
that
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
and
brought
on
a
fit
thibault
felt
appalled
as
he
realised
with
what
scrupulous
exactness
the
black
wolf
had
fulfilled
his
part
of
the
contract
and
not
without
a
shudder
did
he
think
of
the
right
master
isengrin
now
had
to
claim
an
equal
punctuality
of
payment
in
return
he
began
to
wonder
uneasily
whether
the
wolf
after
all
was
the
kind
of
being
that
would
continue
to
be
satisfied
with
a
few
hairs
and
this
the
more
that
both
at
the
moment
of
his
wish
and
during
the
succeeding
minutes
during
which
it
was
being
accomplished
he
had
not
been
conscious
of
the
slightest
sensation
anywhere
about
the
roots
of
his
hair
not
even
of
the
least
little
tickling
he
was
far
from
being
pleasantly
affected
by
the
sight
of
poor
marcotte
s
corpse
he
had
not
loved
him
it
was
true
and
he
had
felt
that
he
had
good
reason
for
not
doing
so
but
his
dislike
to
the
defunct
had
never
gone
so
far
as
to
make
him
wish
for
his
death
and
the
wolf
had
certainly
gone
far
beyond
his
desires
at
the
same
time
thibault
had
never
precisely
said
what
he
did
wish
and
had
left
the
wolf
a
wide
margin
for
the
exercise
of
his
malice
evidently
he
would
have
to
be
more
careful
in
future
in
stating
exactly
what
he
wanted
and
above
all
more
circumspect
as
regards
any
wish
he
might
formulate
as
to
the
baron
although
still
alive
he
was
almost
as
good
as
dead
from
the
moment
when
as
the
result
of
thibault
s
wish
he
had
been
struck
down
as
it
were
by
lightning
he
had
remained
unconscious
his
men
had
laid
him
on
the
heap
of
heather
which
the
had
piled
up
to
hide
the
door
of
the
shed
and
troubled
and
frightened
were
ransacking
the
place
to
try
and
find
some
restorative
which
might
bring
their
master
back
to
life
one
asked
for
vinegar
to
put
on
his
temples
another
for
a
key
to
put
down
his
back
this
one
for
a
bit
of
board
to
slap
his
hands
with
that
for
some
sulphur
to
burn
under
his
nose
in
the
midst
of
all
this
confusion
was
heard
the
voice
of
little
engoulevent
calling
out
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
good
we
don
t
want
all
this
truck
we
want
a
goat
ah
if
only
we
had
a
goat
a
goat
cried
thibault
who
would
have
rejoiced
to
see
the
baron
recover
for
it
would
lift
at
least
part
of
the
burden
now
weighing
on
his
conscience
and
would
also
rid
his
dwelling
of
these
marauders
a
goat
i
have
a
goat
really
you
have
a
goat
cried
engoulevent
oh
my
friends
now
our
dear
master
is
saved
and
so
overcome
with
joy
was
he
that
he
flung
his
arms
round
thibault
s
neck
saying
bring
out
your
goat
my
friend
bring
out
your
goat
thibault
went
to
the
shed
and
led
out
the
goat
which
ran
after
him
bleating
hold
it
firmly
by
the
horns
said
the
huntsman
and
lift
up
one
of
its
front
and
as
he
gave
the
word
the
second
huntsman
drew
from
its
sheath
a
little
knife
which
he
carried
in
his
belt
and
began
carefully
sharpening
it
on
the
grindstone
which
thibault
used
for
his
tools
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
the
feeling
somewhat
uneasy
about
these
preparations
what
don
t
you
know
said
engoulevent
that
there
is
a
little
bone
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
inside
a
goat
s
heart
which
if
crushed
into
powder
is
a
sovereign
remedy
for
apoplexy
you
intend
to
kill
my
goat
exclaimed
thibault
at
the
same
time
leaving
hold
of
the
goat
s
horns
and
dropping
its
foot
but
i
will
not
have
it
fie
fie
said
engoulevent
that
is
not
at
all
a
becoming
speech
monsieur
thibault
would
you
value
the
life
of
our
good
master
as
of
no
more
worth
than
that
of
your
wretched
goat
i
am
truly
ashamed
for
it
s
easy
for
you
to
talk
this
goat
is
all
i
have
to
depend
upon
the
only
thing
i
possess
she
gives
me
milk
and
i
am
fond
of
ah
monsieur
thibault
you
can
not
be
thinking
of
what
you
are
saying
it
is
fortunate
that
the
baron
does
not
hear
you
for
he
would
be
to
know
that
his
precious
life
was
being
bargained
for
in
that
miserly
and
besides
said
one
of
the
prickers
with
a
sneering
laugh
if
master
thibault
values
his
goat
at
a
price
which
he
thinks
only
my
lord
can
pay
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
him
coming
to
the
castle
of
vez
to
claim
this
payment
the
account
can
be
settled
with
what
was
left
over
as
due
to
him
thibault
knew
that
he
could
not
get
the
better
of
these
men
unless
he
again
called
the
devil
to
his
aid
but
he
had
just
received
such
a
lesson
from
satan
that
there
was
no
fear
of
his
exposing
himself
at
all
events
for
a
second
time
the
same
day
to
similar
good
offices
his
one
desire
for
the
time
being
was
not
to
wish
any
sort
of
ill
to
anyone
of
those
present
one
man
dead
another
nearly
so
thibault
found
this
lesson
enough
consequently
he
kept
his
eyes
turned
away
from
the
menacing
and
jeering
countenances
around
him
for
fear
of
being
aggravated
beyond
control
while
his
back
was
turned
the
poor
goat
s
throat
was
cut
her
piteous
cry
alone
informing
him
of
the
fact
and
it
was
no
sooner
killed
than
its
heart
which
had
hardly
ceased
throbbing
was
opened
in
search
of
the
little
bone
of
which
engoulevent
had
spoken
this
found
it
was
ground
into
powder
mixed
with
vinegar
diluted
with
thirteen
drops
of
gall
from
the
bladder
containing
it
the
whole
stirred
together
in
a
glass
with
the
cross
of
a
rosary
and
then
poured
gently
down
the
baron
s
throat
after
his
teeth
had
been
forced
apart
with
the
blade
of
a
dagger
the
effect
of
the
draught
was
immediate
and
truly
miraculous
the
lord
of
vez
sneezed
sat
up
and
said
in
a
voice
intelligible
though
still
a
little
husky
give
me
something
to
engoulevent
handed
him
some
water
in
a
wooden
a
family
possession
of
which
thibault
was
very
proud
but
the
baron
had
no
sooner
put
his
lips
to
it
and
become
aware
of
what
the
vile
abominable
liquid
was
which
they
had
had
the
impudence
to
offer
him
than
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
he
flung
the
vessel
and
its
contents
violently
against
the
wall
and
the
cup
fell
smashed
into
a
thousand
pieces
then
in
a
loud
and
sonorous
voice
which
left
no
doubt
of
his
perfect
recovery
he
called
out
bring
me
some
one
of
the
prickers
mounted
and
rode
at
full
speed
to
the
castle
of
oigny
and
there
requested
the
lord
of
the
place
to
give
him
a
flask
or
two
of
sound
old
burgundy
ten
minutes
after
he
was
back
again
two
bottles
were
uncorked
and
there
being
no
glasses
at
hand
the
baron
put
them
in
turn
to
his
mouth
draining
each
at
a
single
draught
then
he
turned
himself
round
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
murmuring
mâcon
fell
into
a
profound
slumber

the
huntsmen
being
reassured
with
regard
to
their
master
s
health
now
went
in
search
of
the
dogs
which
had
been
left
to
carry
on
the
chase
alone
they
were
found
lying
asleep
the
ground
around
them
stained
with
blood
it
was
evident
that
they
had
run
down
the
buck
and
eaten
it
if
any
doubt
on
the
matter
remained
it
was
done
away
with
by
the
sight
of
the
antlers
and
a
portion
of
the
jaw
bone
the
only
parts
of
the
animal
which
they
could
not
crunch
up
and
which
had
therefore
not
disappeared
in
short
they
were
the
only
ones
who
had
cause
to
be
satisfied
with
the
day
s
work
the
huntsmen
after
shutting
up
the
hounds
in
thibault
s
shed
seeing
that
their
master
was
still
sleeping
began
to
turn
their
thoughts
to
getting
some
supper
they
laid
hands
on
everything
they
could
find
in
the
poor
wretch
s
cupboard
and
roasted
the
goat
politely
inviting
thibault
to
take
a
share
in
the
meal
towards
the
cost
of
which
he
had
not
a
little
contributed
he
refused
giving
as
a
plausible
excuse
the
great
agitation
he
still
was
under
owing
to
marcotte
s
death
and
the
baron
s
accident
he
gathered
up
the
fragments
of
his
beloved
and
seeing
that
it
was
useless
to
think
of
ever
being
able
to
put
it
together
again
he
began
turning
over
in
his
mind
what
it
might
be
possible
for
him
to
do
so
as
to
free
himself
from
the
miserable
existence
which
the
events
of
the
last
two
days
had
rendered
more
insupportable
than
ever
the
first
image
that
appeared
to
him
was
that
of
agnelette
like
the
beautiful
angels
that
pass
before
the
eyes
of
children
in
their
dreams
he
saw
her
figure
dressed
all
in
white
with
large
white
wings
floating
across
a
blue
sky
she
seemed
happy
and
beckoned
to
him
to
follow
saying
the
while
those
who
come
with
me
will
be
very
but
the
only
answer
which
thibault
vouchsafed
to
this
charming
vision
was
a
movement
of
the
head
and
shoulders
which
interpreted
meant
yes
yes
agnelette
i
see
you
and
recognise
you
yesterday
it
would
have
been
all
very
well
to
follow
you
but
i
am
like
a
king
the
arbiter
of
life
and
death
and
i
am
not
the
man
to
make
foolish
concessions
to
a
love
only
born
a
day
ago
and
which
has
hardly
learnt
to
stammer
out
its
first
words
to
marry
you
my
poor
child
far
from
lessening
the
bitter
hardships
of
our
lives
would
only
double
or
treble
the
burden
under
which
we
are
both
borne
down
no
agnelette
no
you
would
make
a
charming
mistress
but
a
wife
she
must
be
in
a
position
to
bring
money
to
support
the
household
equal
in
proportion
to
the
power
which
i
should
his
conscience
told
him
plainly
that
he
was
engaged
to
marry
agnelette
but
he
quieted
it
with
the
assurance
that
if
he
broke
the
engagement
it
would
be
for
the
good
of
that
gentle
creature
i
am
an
upright
man
he
murmured
to
himself
and
it
is
my
duty
to
sacrifice
my
personal
pleasure
to
the
welfare
of
the
dear
child
and
more
than
that
she
is
sufficiently
young
and
pretty
and
good
to
find
a
better
fate
than
what
would
await
her
as
the
wife
of
a
plain
sabot
and
the
end
of
all
these
fine
reflections
was
that
thibault
felt
himself
bound
to
allow
his
foolish
promises
of
the
day
before
to
melt
away
into
air
and
to
forget
the
betrothal
of
which
the
only
witnesses
had
been
the
quivering
leaves
of
the
birch
trees
and
the
pink
blossom
of
the
heather
it
should
be
added
that
there
was
another
mental
vision
not
wholly
irresponsible
for
the
resolution
at
which
thibault
had
arrived
the
vision
of
a
certain
young
widow
owner
of
the
mill
at
croyolles
a
woman
between
and
fresh
and
plump
with
fine
rolling
eyes
not
devoid
of
mischief
moreover
she
was
credibly
supposed
to
be
the
richest
match
in
all
the
country
side
for
her
mill
was
never
idle
and
so
for
all
reasons
as
one
can
clearly
see
it
was
the
very
thing
for
thibault
formerly
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
thibault
to
aspire
to
anyone
in
the
position
of
the
rich
and
beautiful
madame
polet
for
such
was
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
mill
and
this
will
explain
why
her
name
is
introduced
here
for
the
first
time
and
in
truth
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
ever
occurred
as
a
subject
of
serious
consideration
to
our
hero
he
was
astonished
at
himself
for
not
having
thought
of
her
before
but
then
as
he
said
to
himself
he
often
thought
about
her
but
without
hope
while
now
seeing
that
he
was
under
the
protection
of
the
wolf
and
that
he
had
been
endowed
with
a
supernatural
power
which
he
had
already
had
occasion
to
exercise
it
seemed
to
him
an
easy
matter
to
get
rid
of
all
his
rivals
and
achieve
his
purpose
true
there
were
evil
tongues
that
spoke
of
the
owner
of
the
mill
as
having
something
of
an
and
a
hard
heart
but
the
came
to
the
conclusion
that
with
the
devil
up
his
sleeve
he
need
not
trouble
himself
about
any
wicked
spirit
any
petty
little
demon
that
might
find
a
corner
in
widow
polet
s
disposition
and
so
by
the
time
the
day
broke
he
had
decided
to
go
to
croyolles
for
all
these
visions
had
of
course
visited
him
during
the
night
the
lord
of
vez
awoke
with
the
first
song
of
the
birds
he
had
entirely
recovered
from
his
indisposition
of
the
day
before
and
woke
up
his
followers
with
loud
slashings
of
his
whip
having
sent
off
marcotte
s
body
to
vez
he
decided
that
he
would
not
return
home
without
having
killed
something
but
that
he
would
hunt
the
boar
just
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
way
had
taken
place
on
the
previous
day
at
last
about
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
they
all
went
off
the
baron
assuring
thibault
that
he
was
most
grateful
to
him
for
the
hospitality
that
he
himself
and
his
men
and
dogs
had
met
with
under
his
poor
roof
in
consideration
of
which
he
was
quite
willing
he
swore
to
forget
all
the
grievances
which
he
had
against
the
it
will
be
easily
guessed
that
thibault
experienced
little
regret
at
the
departure
of
lord
dogs
and
huntsmen
all
these
having
at
last
disappeared
he
stood
a
few
moments
contemplating
his
ransacked
home
his
empty
cupboard
his
broken
furniture
his
empty
shed
the
ground
scattered
with
fragments
of
his
belongings
but
as
he
told
himself
all
this
was
the
ordinary
thing
to
happen
whenever
one
of
the
great
lords
went
through
a
place
and
the
future
as
it
appeared
to
him
was
far
too
brilliant
to
allow
him
to
dwell
long
on
this
spectacle
he
dressed
himself
in
his
sunday
attire
smartening
himself
as
best
he
could
ate
his
last
bit
of
bread
with
the
last
morsel
left
of
his
goat
went
to
the
spring
and
drank
a
large
glass
of
water
and
started
off
for
croyolles
thibault
was
determined
to
try
his
fortune
with
madame
polet
before
the
day
was
over
and
therefore
set
out
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
shortest
way
to
croyolles
was
round
by
the
rear
of
oigny
and
pisseleu
now
thibault
knew
every
in
and
out
of
the
forest
of
as
well
as
any
tailor
knows
the
pockets
he
has
made
why
therefore
did
he
take
the
chrétiennelle
track
seeing
that
it
lengthened
his
journey
by
a
good
mile
and
a
half
reader
it
was
because
this
lane
would
bring
him
near
to
the
spot
where
he
had
first
seen
agnelette
for
although
practical
considerations
were
carrying
him
in
the
direction
of
croyolles
mill
his
heart
was
drawing
him
towards
préciamont
and
there
as
fate
would
have
it
just
after
crossing
the
road
that
runs
to
la
he
came
upon
agnelette
cutting
grass
by
the
for
her
goats
he
might
easily
have
passed
her
without
being
seen
for
her
back
was
turned
towards
him
but
the
evil
spirit
prompted
him
and
he
went
straight
up
to
her
she
was
stooping
to
cut
the
grass
with
her
sickle
but
hearing
someone
approaching
she
lifted
her
head
and
blushed
as
she
recognised
that
it
was
thibault
with
the
blush
a
happy
smile
rose
to
her
face
which
showed
that
the
rising
colour
was
not
due
to
any
feeling
of
hostility
towards
him
ah
there
you
are
she
said
i
dreamt
much
of
you
last
night
and
prayed
many
prayers
for
you
and
as
she
spoke
the
vision
of
agnelette
passing
along
the
sky
with
the
dress
and
wings
of
an
angel
and
her
hands
joined
in
supplication
as
he
had
seen
her
the
previous
night
returned
to
him
and
what
made
you
dream
of
me
and
pray
for
me
my
pretty
child
asked
thibault
with
as
unconcerned
an
air
as
a
young
lord
at
court
agnelette
looked
at
him
with
her
large
eyes
of
heavenly
blue
i
dreamed
of
you
thibault
because
i
love
you
she
said
and
i
prayed
for
you
because
i
saw
the
accident
that
happened
to
the
baron
and
his
huntsmen
and
all
the
trouble
that
you
were
put
to
in
consequence
ah
if
i
had
been
able
to
obey
the
dictates
of
my
heart
i
should
have
run
to
you
at
once
to
give
you
it
is
a
pity
you
did
not
come
you
would
have
found
a
merry
company
i
can
tell
oh
it
was
not
for
that
i
should
have
liked
to
be
with
you
but
to
be
of
use
to
you
in
receiving
the
baron
and
his
train
oh
what
a
beautiful
ring
you
have
monsieur
thibault
where
did
you
get
it
and
the
girl
pointed
to
the
ring
which
had
been
given
to
thibault
by
the
wolf
thibault
felt
his
blood
run
cold
this
ring
he
said
yes
that
ring
and
seeing
that
thibault
appeared
unwilling
to
answer
her
agnelette
turned
her
head
aside
and
sighed
a
present
from
some
fine
lady
i
suppose
she
said
in
a
low
voice
there
you
are
mistaken
agnelette
replied
thibault
with
all
the
assurance
of
a
consummate
liar
it
is
our
betrothal
ring
the
one
i
have
bought
to
put
on
your
finger
the
day
we
are
why
not
tell
me
the
truth
monsieur
thibault
said
agnelette
shaking
her
head
sadly
i
am
speaking
the
truth
no
and
she
shook
her
head
more
sadly
than
before
and
what
makes
you
think
that
i
am
telling
a
lie
because
the
ring
is
large
enough
to
go
over
two
of
my
and
thibault
s
finger
would
certainly
have
made
two
of
agnelette
s
if
it
is
too
large
agnelette
he
said
we
can
have
it
made
monsieur
what
you
are
going
to
leave
me
yes
i
am
and
why
agnelette
because
i
do
not
love
thibault
tried
to
think
of
some
vow
he
could
make
to
reassure
agnelette
but
in
vain
listen
said
agnelette
with
tears
in
her
eyes
for
it
was
not
without
a
great
effort
of
that
she
was
turning
away
if
that
ring
is
really
meant
for
me
agnelette
i
swear
to
you
that
it
well
then
give
it
me
to
keep
till
our
wedding
day
and
on
that
day
i
will
give
it
back
to
you
that
you
may
have
it
i
will
give
it
you
with
all
my
heart
replied
thibault
but
i
want
to
see
it
on
your
pretty
hand
you
were
right
in
saying
that
it
was
too
large
for
you
and
i
am
going
into
we
will
take
the
measure
of
your
finger
and
i
will
get
monsieur
dugué
the
goldsmith
there
to
alter
it
for
the
smile
returned
to
agnelette
s
face
and
her
tears
were
dried
up
at
once
she
put
out
her
little
hand
thibault
took
it
between
his
own
turned
it
over
and
looked
at
it
first
on
the
back
and
then
on
the
palm
and
stooping
kissed
it
oh
said
agnelette
you
should
not
kiss
my
hand
monsieur
thibault
it
is
not
pretty
give
me
something
else
then
to
and
agnelette
lifted
her
face
that
he
might
kiss
her
on
the
forehead
and
now
she
said
joyously
and
with
childish
eagerness
let
me
see
the
thibault
drew
off
the
ring
and
laughing
tried
to
put
it
on
agnelette
s
thumb
but
to
his
great
astonishment
he
could
not
get
it
over
the
joint
well
well
he
exclaimed
who
would
ever
have
thought
such
a
thing
agnelette
began
to
laugh
it
is
funny
isn
t
it
she
said
then
thibault
tried
to
pass
it
over
the
first
finger
but
with
the
same
result
as
when
he
put
it
on
the
thumb
he
next
tried
the
middle
finger
but
the
ring
seemed
to
grow
smaller
and
smaller
as
if
fearing
to
sully
this
virgin
hand
then
the
third
finger
the
same
on
which
he
wore
it
himself
but
it
was
equally
impossible
to
get
it
on
and
as
he
made
these
vain
attempts
to
fit
the
ring
thibault
felt
agnelette
s
hand
trembling
more
and
more
violently
within
his
own
while
the
sweat
fell
from
his
own
brow
as
if
he
were
engaged
in
the
most
arduous
work
there
was
something
diabolic
at
the
bottom
of
it
as
he
knew
quite
well
at
last
he
came
to
the
little
finger
and
endeavoured
to
pass
the
ring
over
it
this
little
finger
so
small
and
transparent
that
the
ring
should
have
hung
as
loosely
upon
it
as
a
bracelet
on
one
of
thibault
s
this
little
finger
in
spite
of
all
agnelette
s
efforts
refused
to
pass
through
the
ring
ah
my
god
monsieur
thibault
cried
the
child
what
does
this
mean
ring
of
the
devil
return
to
the
devil
cried
thibault
flinging
the
ring
against
a
rock
in
the
hope
that
it
would
be
broken
as
it
struck
the
rock
it
emitted
flame
then
it
rebounded
and
in
rebounding
fitted
itself
on
to
thibault
s
finger
agnelette
who
saw
this
strange
evolution
of
the
ring
looked
at
thibault
in
horrified
amazement
well
he
said
trying
to
brave
it
out
what
is
the
matter
agnelette
did
not
answer
but
as
she
continued
to
look
at
thibault
her
eye
grew
more
and
more
wild
and
frightened
thibault
could
not
think
what
she
was
looking
at
but
slowly
lifting
her
hand
and
pointing
with
her
finger
at
thibault
s
head
she
said
oh
monsieur
thibault
monsieur
thibault
what
have
you
got
there
where
asked
thibault
there
there
cried
agnelette
growing
paler
and
paler
well
but
where
cried
the
stamping
with
his
foot
tell
me
what
you
but
instead
of
replying
agnelette
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
uttering
a
cry
of
terror
turned
and
fled
with
all
her
might
thibault
stunned
by
what
had
happened
did
not
even
attempt
to
follow
her
he
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
unable
to
move
or
speak
as
if
thunderstruck
what
had
agnelette
seen
that
had
alarmed
her
so
what
was
it
that
she
pointed
to
with
her
finger
had
god
branded
him
as
he
branded
the
first
murderer
and
why
not
had
not
he
like
cain
killed
a
man
and
in
the
last
sermon
he
had
heard
at
oigny
had
not
the
preacher
said
that
all
men
were
brothers
thibault
felt
wild
with
misgivings
what
had
so
terrified
agnelette
that
he
must
find
out
without
delay
at
first
he
thought
he
would
go
into
the
town
of
and
look
at
himself
in
a
glass
but
then
supposing
the
fatal
mark
was
upon
him
and
others
besides
agnelette
were
to
see
it
no
he
must
think
of
some
other
way
of
finding
out
he
could
of
course
pull
his
hat
over
his
brow
and
run
back
to
oigny
where
he
had
a
fragment
of
mirror
in
which
he
could
see
himself
but
oigny
was
a
long
way
off
then
he
remembered
that
only
a
few
paces
from
where
he
stood
there
was
a
spring
as
transparent
as
crystal
which
fed
the
pond
near
baisemont
and
those
at
bourg
he
would
be
able
to
see
himself
in
that
as
clearly
as
in
the
finest
mirror
from
so
thibault
went
to
the
side
of
the
stream
and
kneeling
down
looked
at
himself
he
saw
the
same
eyes
the
same
nose
and
the
same
mouth
and
not
even
the
slightest
little
mark
upon
the
forehead
he
drew
a
breath
of
relief
but
still
there
must
have
been
something
agnelette
had
certainly
not
taken
fright
as
she
had
for
nothing
thibault
bent
over
closer
to
the
crystal
water
and
now
he
saw
there
was
something
bright
that
shone
amid
the
dark
curls
on
his
head
and
fell
over
his
forehead
he
leaned
closer
still
it
was
a
red
hair
a
red
hair
but
of
a
most
peculiar
red
not
sandy
coloured
or
carrotty
neither
of
a
light
shade
nor
a
dark
but
a
red
of
the
colour
of
blood
with
a
brightness
of
the
most
vivid
flame
without
stopping
to
consider
how
a
hair
of
such
a
phenomenal
colour
could
possibly
have
grown
there
he
began
trying
to
pull
it
out
he
drew
forward
the
curl
where
gleamed
the
terrible
red
hair
that
it
might
hang
over
the
water
and
then
taking
hold
of
it
carefully
between
his
finger
and
thumb
gave
it
a
violent
pull
but
the
hair
refused
to
come
away
thinking
that
he
had
not
got
sufficient
hold
of
it
he
tried
another
way
winding
the
hair
round
his
finger
and
again
giving
it
a
vigorous
jerk
the
hair
cut
into
his
fingers
but
remained
as
firmly
rooted
as
ever
thibault
then
turned
it
round
two
of
his
fingers
and
pulled
again
the
hair
lifted
a
little
bit
of
his
scalp
but
as
to
moving
thibault
might
as
well
have
tried
to
move
the
oak
that
threw
its
shady
branches
across
the
stream
thibault
began
to
think
that
he
would
do
better
to
continue
his
walk
to
croyolles
after
all
as
he
remarked
to
himself
the
questionable
colour
of
a
single
hair
would
not
hardly
upset
his
plans
of
marriage
neverthetheless
the
wretched
hair
caused
him
a
great
deal
of
worry
he
could
not
get
it
out
of
his
mind
it
seemed
to
dance
before
his
eyes
dazzling
him
like
flames
of
running
fire
until
at
last
out
of
all
patience
he
stamped
his
foot
exclaiming
by
all
the
devils
in
hell
i
am
not
far
from
home
yet
and
i
ll
get
the
better
of
this
confounded
hair
whereupon
he
set
off
running
back
towards
his
hut
went
in
and
found
his
fragment
of
mirror
got
hold
of
his
hair
again
seized
a
carpenter
s
chisel
placed
it
so
as
to
cut
off
the
hair
as
close
to
the
head
as
possible
and
keeping
hair
and
tool
in
this
position
leant
over
his
bench
and
dug
the
chisel
down
with
as
much
force
as
possible
the
tool
cut
deeply
into
the
wood
of
the
bench
but
the
hair
remained
intact
he
tried
the
same
plan
again
only
this
time
he
armed
himself
with
a
mallet
which
he
swung
over
his
head
and
brought
down
with
redoubled
blows
on
the
handle
of
the
chisel
but
he
was
as
far
as
ever
from
carrying
out
his
purpose
he
noticed
however
that
there
was
a
little
notch
in
the
sharp
edge
of
the
chisel
just
the
width
of
a
hair
thibault
sighed
he
understood
now
that
this
hair
the
price
he
had
paid
in
return
for
his
wish
belonged
to
the
black
wolf
and
he
gave
up
all
further
attempts
to
get
rid
of
it
chapter
vii
the
boy
at
the
mill
finding
it
impossible
either
to
cut
off
or
pull
out
the
accursed
hair
the
only
thing
left
for
thibault
to
do
was
to
hide
it
as
well
as
he
could
by
bringing
the
other
hair
over
it
everybody
would
not
he
hoped
have
such
eyes
as
agnelette
as
we
have
already
said
thibault
had
a
fine
head
of
black
hair
and
by
parting
it
down
the
side
and
giving
a
certain
turn
to
the
front
lock
he
trusted
that
the
one
hair
would
pass
unobserved
he
recalled
with
envy
the
young
lords
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
court
of
madame
de
maintenon
for
with
their
powdered
wigs
to
cover
it
the
colour
of
their
hair
whatever
it
might
be
was
of
no
moment
he
unfortunately
could
not
make
use
of
powder
to
hide
his
being
prohibited
from
doing
so
by
the
sumptuary
laws
of
the
period
however
having
successfully
managed
by
an
adroit
turn
of
the
comb
to
hide
his
one
red
hair
artistically
under
the
others
thibault
decided
to
start
again
on
his
premeditated
visit
to
the
fair
owner
of
the
mill
he
was
careful
this
time
instead
of
inclining
to
the
left
to
verge
towards
the
right
fearing
to
meet
agnelette
if
he
followed
the
same
path
as
he
had
taken
that
morning
emerging
therefore
on
to
the
road
leading
to
la
he
then
took
the
footpath
which
runs
direct
to
pisseleu
across
the
fields
arriving
at
pisseleu
he
continued
along
the
valley
in
the
direction
of
croyolles
but
had
scarcely
pursued
this
lower
road
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
walking
just
ahead
of
him
he
saw
two
donkeys
being
driven
by
a
tall
youth
whom
he
recognised
as
a
cousin
of
his
named
landry
cousin
landry
was
head
boy
at
the
mill
in
the
service
of
the
owner
whom
thibault
was
on
his
way
to
visit
and
as
the
latter
had
but
an
indirect
acquaintance
with
the
widow
polet
he
had
counted
on
landry
to
introduce
him
it
was
a
lucky
chance
therefore
to
come
across
his
cousin
like
this
and
thibault
hastened
to
overtake
him
hearing
footsteps
behind
him
echoing
his
own
landry
turned
and
recognised
thibault
thibault
had
always
found
landry
a
pleasant
and
cheerful
companion
and
he
was
therefore
very
much
astonished
to
see
him
looking
sad
and
troubled
landry
waited
for
thibault
to
come
up
to
him
letting
his
donkeys
go
on
alone
thibault
was
the
first
to
speak
why
cousin
landry
he
asked
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
here
am
i
putting
myself
out
and
leaving
my
work
to
come
and
shake
hands
with
a
friend
and
relation
that
i
have
not
seen
for
more
than
six
weeks
and
you
greet
me
with
a
face
like
that
ah
my
dear
thibault
replied
landry
what
would
you
have
of
me
i
may
greet
you
with
a
gloomy
face
but
believe
me
or
not
as
you
will
i
am
truly
delighted
to
see
that
may
be
as
you
say
but
you
do
not
appear
what
do
you
mean
you
tell
me
you
are
delighted
to
see
me
in
a
tone
of
voice
fit
to
bring
on
the
why
my
dear
landry
you
are
generally
as
bright
and
lively
as
the
of
your
mill
and
singing
songs
to
accompany
it
and
you
are
as
melancholy
as
the
crosses
in
the
cemetery
how
now
then
has
the
mill
stopped
for
want
of
water
oh
not
that
there
is
no
want
of
water
on
the
contrary
there
is
more
than
usual
and
the
sluice
is
kept
constantly
at
work
but
you
see
instead
of
corn
it
is
my
heart
that
is
in
the
mill
and
the
mill
works
so
well
and
so
incessantly
and
my
heart
is
so
ground
between
the
stones
that
there
is
nothing
left
of
it
but
a
little
indeed
are
you
so
miserable
then
at
the
mill
ah
would
to
god
i
had
been
dragged
under
the
wheel
the
first
day
i
put
my
foot
inside
it
but
what
is
it
you
frighten
me
landry
tell
me
all
your
troubles
my
dear
landry
gave
a
deep
sigh
we
are
cousins
continued
thibault
and
if
i
am
too
poor
to
give
you
a
few
crowns
to
help
you
out
of
any
money
trouble
you
are
in
well
i
can
at
least
give
you
some
words
of
good
advice
if
it
is
a
matter
of
the
heart
that
is
causing
you
thank
you
thibault
but
neither
money
nor
advice
can
do
me
any
well
anyhow
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
it
eases
trouble
to
speak
of
no
no
it
would
be
useless
i
will
say
thibault
began
to
laugh
you
laugh
said
landry
both
angry
and
astonished
my
trouble
makes
you
laugh
i
am
not
laughing
at
your
trouble
landry
but
at
your
thinking
that
you
can
hide
the
cause
of
it
from
me
when
it
is
as
easy
as
anything
to
guess
what
it
guess
why
you
are
in
love
nothing
more
difficult
than
that
to
guess
i
can
i
in
love
exclaimed
landry
why
who
has
been
telling
you
lies
like
that
it
is
not
a
lie
it
is
the
landry
again
drew
a
deep
sigh
more
laden
with
despair
even
than
his
former
one
well
yes
he
said
it
is
so
i
am
in
love
ah
that
s
right
you
have
spoken
out
at
last
said
thibault
not
without
a
certain
quickening
of
the
pulse
for
he
foresaw
a
rival
in
his
cousin
and
with
whom
are
you
in
love
with
whom
yes
i
ask
you
with
whom
as
to
that
cousin
thibault
you
will
have
to
drag
the
heart
out
of
my
breast
before
i
tell
you
have
told
me
what
i
have
told
you
who
it
is
cried
landry
staring
at
thibault
with
astonished
eyes
certainly
you
surely
you
can
not
mean
it
did
you
not
say
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
to
have
been
dragged
under
by
the
mill
wheel
the
first
day
you
entered
into
the
service
of
madame
polet
than
to
have
been
taken
on
by
her
as
chief
hand
you
are
unhappy
at
the
mill
and
you
are
in
love
therefore
you
are
in
love
with
the
mistress
of
the
mill
and
it
is
this
love
which
is
causing
your
ah
thibault
pray
hush
what
if
she
were
to
overhear
us
how
is
it
possible
that
she
can
overhear
us
where
do
you
imagine
her
to
be
unless
she
is
able
to
make
herself
invisible
or
to
change
herself
into
a
butterfly
or
a
flower
never
mind
thibault
you
keep
your
mistress
of
the
mill
is
then
is
she
and
takes
no
pity
on
your
despair
poor
fellow
was
thibault
s
rejoinder
but
his
words
though
seemingly
expressive
of
great
commiseration
had
a
shade
of
satisfaction
and
amusement
in
them
i
should
think
so
indeed
said
landry
in
the
beginning
i
was
foolish
enough
to
fancy
that
she
did
not
repulse
my
love
all
day
long
i
was
devouring
her
with
my
eyes
and
now
and
then
she
too
would
fix
her
eyes
on
me
and
after
looking
at
me
a
while
would
smile
alas
my
dear
thibault
what
happiness
those
looks
and
smiles
were
to
me
ah
why
did
i
not
content
myself
with
them
well
there
it
is
said
thibault
philosophically
man
is
so
alas
yes
i
forgot
that
i
had
to
do
with
someone
above
me
in
position
and
i
spoke
then
madame
polet
flew
into
a
great
rage
called
me
an
insolent
beggar
and
threatened
to
turn
me
out
of
doors
the
very
next
phew
said
thibault
and
how
long
ago
is
that
nearly
three
and
the
following
week
is
still
to
come
the
as
he
put
the
question
began
to
feel
a
revival
of
the
uneasiness
which
had
been
momentarily
allayed
for
he
understood
women
better
than
his
cousin
landry
after
a
minute
s
silence
he
continued
well
well
you
are
not
so
unhappy
after
all
as
i
thought
not
so
unhappy
as
you
thought
me
ah
if
you
only
knew
the
life
i
lead
never
a
look
or
a
smile
when
she
meets
me
she
turns
away
when
i
speak
to
her
on
matters
concerning
the
mill
she
listens
with
such
a
disdainful
air
that
instead
of
talking
of
bran
and
wheat
and
rye
of
barley
and
oats
of
first
and
second
crops
i
begin
to
cry
and
then
she
says
to
me
care
in
such
a
menacing
tone
that
i
run
away
and
hide
myself
behind
the
well
but
why
do
you
pay
your
addresses
to
this
mistress
of
yours
there
are
plenty
of
girls
in
the
country
round
who
would
be
glad
to
have
you
for
their
because
i
love
her
in
spite
of
myself
i
can
not
help
it
so
there
take
up
with
some
one
else
i
d
think
no
more
about
i
could
not
do
at
any
rate
you
might
try
it
s
just
possible
that
if
she
saw
you
transferring
your
affections
to
another
the
mistress
of
the
mill
might
grow
jealous
and
might
then
run
after
you
as
you
are
now
running
after
her
women
are
such
curious
oh
if
i
was
sure
of
that
i
would
begin
to
try
at
once
although
now
and
landry
shook
his
head
well
what
about
now
although
now
after
all
that
has
happened
it
would
be
of
no
what
has
happened
then
asked
thibault
who
was
anxious
to
ascertain
all
particulars
oh
as
to
that
nothing
replied
landry
and
i
do
not
even
dare
speak
of
why
because
as
they
say
with
us
best
let
sleeping
dogs
thibault
would
have
continued
to
urge
landry
to
tell
him
what
the
trouble
was
to
which
he
referred
but
they
were
now
near
the
mill
and
their
explanation
would
have
to
remain
unfinished
even
if
once
begun
what
was
more
thibault
thought
that
he
already
knew
enough
landry
was
in
love
with
the
fair
owner
of
the
mill
but
the
fair
owner
of
the
mill
was
not
in
love
with
landry
and
in
truth
he
feared
no
danger
from
a
rival
such
as
this
it
was
with
a
certain
pride
and
that
he
compared
the
timid
boyish
looks
of
his
cousin
a
mere
lad
of
eighteen
with
his
own
five
feet
six
and
figure
and
he
was
naturally
led
into
thinking
that
however
little
of
a
woman
of
taste
madame
polet
might
be
landry
s
failure
was
a
good
reason
for
believing
that
his
own
success
was
assured
the
mill
at
croyolles
is
charmingly
situated
at
the
bottom
of
a
cool
green
valley
the
stream
that
works
it
forms
a
little
pond
which
is
shaded
by
pollard
willows
and
slender
poplars
and
between
these
dwarfed
and
giant
trees
stand
magnificent
alders
and
immense
walnut
trees
with
their
fragrant
foliage
after
turning
the
wheel
of
the
mill
the
foaming
water
runs
off
in
a
little
rivulet
which
never
ceases
its
hymn
of
joy
as
it
goes
leaping
over
the
pebbles
of
its
bed
starring
the
flowers
that
lean
coquettishly
over
to
look
at
themselves
in
its
clear
shallows
with
the
liquid
diamonds
that
are
scattered
by
its
tiny
waterfalls
the
mill
itself
lies
so
hidden
in
a
bower
of
shrubs
behind
the
sycamores
and
weeping
willows
that
until
one
is
within
a
short
distance
of
it
nothing
is
to
be
seen
but
the
chimney
from
which
the
smoke
rises
against
the
background
of
trees
like
a
column
of
blue
tinted
alabaster
although
thibault
was
familiar
with
the
spot
the
sight
of
it
filled
him
as
he
now
looked
upon
it
with
a
feeling
of
delight
which
he
had
not
hitherto
experienced
but
then
he
had
never
before
gazed
on
it
under
the
conditions
in
which
he
now
found
himself
for
he
was
already
conscious
of
that
sense
of
personal
satisfaction
which
the
proprietor
feels
on
visiting
an
estate
which
has
been
obtained
for
him
by
proxy
on
entering
the
where
the
scene
was
more
animated
he
was
moved
to
even
greater
ecstasy
of
enjoyment
the
blue
and
pigeons
were
cooing
on
the
roofs
the
ducks
quacking
and
going
through
sundry
evolutions
in
the
stream
the
hens
were
clucking
on
the
and
the
turkey
cocks
bridling
and
strutting
as
they
courted
the
while
the
brown
and
white
cows
came
slowly
in
from
the
fields
their
udders
full
of
milk
here
on
one
side
a
cart
was
being
unloaded
there
as
they
were
being
unharnessed
two
splendid
horses
neighed
and
stretched
their
necks
now
freed
from
the
collar
towards
their
mangers
a
boy
was
carrying
a
sack
up
into
the
granary
and
a
girl
was
bringing
another
sack
filled
with
crusts
and
the
refuse
water
to
an
enormous
pig
that
lay
basking
in
the
sun
waiting
to
be
transformed
into
sausages
and
black
puddings
all
the
animals
of
the
ark
were
there
from
the
braying
donkey
to
the
crowing
cock
mingling
their
discordant
voices
in
this
rural
concert
while
the
mill
with
its
regular
seemed
to
be
beating
time
thibault
felt
quite
dazzled
he
saw
himself
the
owner
of
all
that
he
now
looked
upon
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
with
such
evident
pleasure
that
landry
if
he
had
not
been
so
absorbed
in
his
own
trouble
which
grew
ever
greater
as
they
drew
nearer
to
the
house
would
certainly
have
noticed
this
apparently
causeless
emotion
of
joy
on
his
cousin
s
part
as
they
entered
the
the
widow
who
was
in
the
became
aware
of
their
presence
and
seemed
very
inquisitive
to
know
who
the
stranger
was
who
had
returned
with
her
head
boy
thibault
with
an
easy
and
confident
sort
of
manner
went
up
to
the
gave
his
name
and
explained
to
her
that
having
a
great
wish
to
see
his
cousin
landry
he
had
decided
to
come
over
and
introduce
himself
to
her
the
mistress
of
the
mill
was
extremely
gracious
and
invited
the
new
comer
to
spend
the
day
at
the
mill
accompanying
her
invitation
with
a
smile
that
thibault
took
as
a
most
favourable
augury
thibault
had
not
come
unprovided
with
a
present
he
had
unhooked
some
thrushes
which
he
had
found
caught
in
a
snare
set
with
as
he
came
through
the
forest
and
the
widow
sent
them
at
once
to
be
plucked
saying
as
she
did
so
that
she
hoped
thibault
would
stay
to
eat
his
share
of
them
but
he
could
not
help
noticing
that
all
the
while
she
was
speaking
to
him
she
kept
on
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
something
which
seemed
to
attract
her
attention
and
turning
quickly
he
saw
that
the
of
the
fair
owner
of
the
mill
had
evidently
been
caused
by
watching
landry
who
was
unloading
his
asses
becoming
conscious
that
thibault
had
noticed
the
wandering
of
her
looks
and
attention
madame
polet
turned
as
red
as
a
cherry
but
immediately
recovering
herself
she
said
to
her
new
acquaintance
monsieur
thibault
it
would
be
kind
of
you
who
appear
so
robust
to
go
and
help
your
cousin
you
can
see
that
the
job
is
too
heavy
a
one
for
him
alone
and
so
saying
she
went
back
into
the
house
now
the
devil
muttered
thibault
as
he
looked
first
after
madame
polet
and
then
at
landry
is
the
fellow
after
all
more
fortunate
than
he
suspects
himself
and
shall
i
be
forced
to
call
the
black
wolf
to
my
assistance
to
get
rid
of
him
however
he
went
as
the
owner
of
the
mill
had
asked
him
and
gave
the
required
assistance
feeling
quite
sure
that
the
pretty
widow
was
looking
at
him
through
some
chink
or
other
of
the
curtain
he
put
forth
all
his
strength
and
displayed
to
the
full
his
athletic
grace
in
the
accomplishment
of
the
task
in
which
he
was
sharing
the
unloading
finished
they
all
assembled
in
the
where
a
was
busy
setting
the
table
as
soon
as
dinner
was
served
madame
polet
took
her
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
with
thibault
to
her
right
she
was
all
attention
and
politeness
to
the
latter
so
much
so
indeed
that
thibault
who
had
been
temporarily
crestfallen
took
heart
again
filled
with
hope
in
order
to
do
honour
to
thibault
s
present
she
had
herself
dressed
the
birds
with
and
so
prepared
no
more
delicate
or
appetising
dish
could
well
have
been
provided
while
laughing
at
thibault
s
sallies
however
she
cast
stealthy
glances
now
and
again
at
landry
who
she
saw
had
not
touched
what
she
herself
had
placed
on
the
poor
boy
s
plate
and
also
that
great
tears
were
rolling
down
his
cheeks
and
falling
into
the
untasted
juniper
sauce
this
mute
sorrow
touched
her
heart
a
look
almost
of
tenderness
came
into
her
face
as
she
made
a
sign
to
him
with
her
head
which
seemed
to
say
so
expressive
was
it
eat
landry
i
beg
of
there
was
a
whole
world
of
loving
promises
in
this
little
pantomime
landry
understood
the
gesture
for
he
nearly
choked
himself
trying
to
swallow
the
bird
at
one
mouthful
so
eager
was
he
to
obey
the
orders
of
his
fair
mistress
nothing
of
all
this
escaped
thibault
s
eye
he
swore
to
himself
using
an
oath
that
he
had
heard
in
the
mouth
of
the
seigneur
jean
and
which
now
that
he
was
the
friend
of
the
devil
he
fancied
he
might
use
like
any
other
great
lord
can
it
be
possible
he
thought
that
she
is
really
in
love
with
this
slip
of
a
youth
well
if
so
it
does
not
say
much
for
her
taste
and
more
than
that
it
does
not
suit
my
plans
at
all
no
no
my
fair
mistress
what
you
need
is
a
man
who
will
know
how
to
look
well
after
the
affairs
of
the
mill
and
that
man
will
be
myself
or
the
black
wolf
will
find
himself
in
the
wrong
noticing
a
minute
later
that
madame
polet
had
finally
gone
back
to
the
earlier
stage
of
glances
and
smiles
which
landry
had
described
to
him
he
continued
i
see
i
shall
have
to
resort
to
stronger
measures
for
lose
her
i
will
not
there
is
not
another
match
in
all
the
countryside
that
would
suit
me
equally
well
but
then
what
am
i
to
do
with
cousin
landry
his
love
it
is
true
upsets
my
arrangements
but
i
really
can
not
for
so
small
a
thing
send
him
to
join
the
wretched
marcotte
in
the
other
world
but
what
a
fool
i
am
to
bother
my
brains
about
finding
a
way
to
help
myself
it
s
the
wolf
s
business
not
mine
then
in
a
low
voice
black
wolf
he
said
arrange
matters
in
such
a
way
that
without
any
accident
or
harm
happening
to
my
cousin
landry
i
may
get
rid
of
the
prayer
was
scarcely
uttered
when
he
caught
sight
of
a
small
body
of
four
or
five
men
in
military
uniform
walking
down
the
and
coming
towards
the
mill
landry
also
saw
them
for
he
uttered
a
loud
cry
got
up
as
if
to
run
away
and
then
fell
back
in
his
chair
as
if
all
power
of
movement
had
forsaken
him
chapter
viii
thibault
s
whishes
the
widow
on
perceiving
the
effect
which
the
sight
of
the
soldiers
advancing
towards
the
mill
had
upon
landry
was
almost
as
frightened
as
the
lad
himself
ah
dear
god
she
cried
what
is
the
matter
my
poor
landry
say
what
is
the
matter
asked
thibault
in
his
turn
alas
i
replied
landry
last
thursday
in
a
moment
of
despair
meeting
the
at
the
inn
i
in
a
moment
of
despair
exclaimed
the
mistress
of
the
mill
and
why
were
you
in
despair
i
was
in
despair
said
landry
with
a
mighty
effort
i
was
in
despair
because
i
love
and
it
is
because
you
loved
me
unhappy
boy
that
you
enlisted
did
you
not
say
that
you
would
turn
me
away
from
the
mill
and
have
i
turned
you
away
asked
madame
polet
with
an
expression
which
it
was
impossible
to
misinterpret
ah
god
then
you
would
not
really
have
sent
me
away
asked
landry
poor
boy
said
the
mistress
of
the
mill
with
a
smile
and
a
pitying
movement
of
the
shoulders
which
at
any
other
time
would
have
made
landry
almost
die
of
joy
but
as
it
was
only
doubled
his
distress
perhaps
even
now
i
might
have
time
to
hide
he
said
hide
said
thibault
that
will
be
of
no
use
i
can
tell
and
why
not
said
madame
polet
i
am
going
to
try
anyhow
come
dear
and
she
led
the
young
man
away
with
every
mark
of
the
most
loving
sympathy
thibault
followed
them
with
his
eyes
it
s
going
badly
for
you
thibault
my
friend
he
said
fortunately
let
her
hide
him
as
cleverly
as
she
may
they
have
a
good
scent
and
will
find
him
in
saying
this
thibault
was
unconscious
that
he
was
giving
utterance
to
a
fresh
wish
the
widow
had
evidently
not
hidden
landry
very
far
away
for
she
returned
after
a
few
seconds
of
absence
the
was
probably
all
the
safer
for
being
near
she
had
scarcely
had
time
to
take
breath
when
the
and
his
companions
appeared
at
the
door
two
remained
outside
no
doubt
to
catch
landry
if
he
should
attempt
to
escape
the
sergeant
and
the
other
soldier
walked
in
with
the
confidence
of
men
who
are
conscious
of
acting
under
authority
the
sergeant
cast
a
searching
glance
round
the
room
brought
back
his
right
foot
into
the
third
position
and
lifted
his
hand
to
the
peak
of
his
cap
the
mistress
of
the
mill
did
not
wait
for
the
sergeant
to
address
her
but
with
one
of
her
most
fascinating
smiles
asked
him
if
he
would
like
some
refreshment
an
offer
which
no
is
ever
known
to
refuse
then
thinking
it
a
favourable
moment
to
put
the
question
she
asked
them
while
they
were
drinking
their
wine
what
had
brought
them
to
croyolles
mill
the
sergeant
replied
that
he
had
come
in
search
of
a
lad
belonging
to
the
mill
who
after
drinking
with
him
to
his
majesty
s
health
and
signed
his
engagement
had
not
the
lad
in
question
interrogated
as
to
his
name
and
had
declared
himself
to
be
one
landry
living
with
madame
polet
a
widow
owner
of
the
mill
at
croyolles
on
the
strength
of
this
declaration
he
had
now
come
to
madame
polet
widow
of
croyolles
mill
to
reclaim
the
defaulter
the
widow
quite
convinced
that
it
was
permissible
to
lie
for
a
good
cause
assured
the
sergeant
that
she
knew
nothing
of
landry
nor
had
any
one
of
that
name
ever
been
at
the
mill
the
sergeant
in
reply
said
that
madame
had
the
finest
eyes
and
the
most
charming
mouth
in
the
world
but
that
was
no
reason
why
he
should
implicitly
believe
the
glances
of
the
one
or
the
words
of
the
other
he
was
bound
therefore
he
continued
to
ask
the
fair
widow
to
allow
him
to
search
the
the
search
was
begun
in
about
five
minutes
the
sergeant
came
back
into
the
room
and
asked
madam
polet
for
the
key
of
her
room
the
widow
appeared
very
much
surprised
and
shocked
at
such
a
request
but
the
sergeant
was
so
persistent
and
determined
that
at
last
she
was
forced
to
give
up
the
key
a
minute
or
two
later
and
the
sergeant
walked
in
again
dragging
landry
in
after
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
when
the
widow
saw
them
both
enter
she
turned
deadly
pale
as
for
thibault
his
heart
beat
so
violently
that
he
thought
it
would
burst
for
without
the
black
wolf
s
assistance
he
was
sure
the
sergeant
would
never
have
gone
to
look
for
landry
where
he
had
found
him
ah
ah
my
good
fellow
cried
the
sergeant
in
a
mocking
voice
so
we
prefer
the
service
of
beauty
to
the
king
s
service
that
is
easy
to
understand
but
when
one
has
the
good
fortune
to
be
born
in
his
majesty
s
domains
and
to
have
drunk
his
health
one
has
to
give
him
a
share
of
service
when
his
turn
comes
so
you
must
come
along
with
us
my
fine
fellow
and
after
a
few
years
in
the
king
s
uniform
you
can
come
back
and
serve
under
your
old
flag
so
now
then
march
but
cried
the
widow
landry
is
not
yet
twenty
and
you
have
not
the
right
to
take
him
under
she
is
right
added
landry
i
am
not
twenty
and
when
will
you
be
twenty
not
until
good
said
the
sergeant
we
will
put
you
on
a
bed
of
straw
like
a
medlar
and
by
at
when
we
wake
you
up
you
will
be
landry
wept
the
widow
prayed
pleaded
implored
allowed
herself
to
be
kissed
by
the
soldiers
patiently
endured
the
coarse
pleasantry
excited
by
her
sorrow
and
at
last
offered
a
hundred
crowns
to
buy
him
off
but
all
was
of
no
avail
landry
s
wrists
were
bound
and
then
one
of
the
soldiers
taking
hold
of
the
end
of
the
cord
the
party
started
off
but
not
before
the
lad
of
the
mill
had
found
time
to
assure
his
dear
mistress
that
far
or
near
he
would
always
love
her
and
that
if
he
died
her
name
would
be
the
last
upon
his
lips
the
beautiful
widow
on
her
side
had
lost
all
thought
of
the
world
s
opinion
in
face
of
this
great
catastrophe
and
before
he
was
led
away
she
clasped
landry
to
her
heart
in
a
tender
embrace
when
the
little
party
had
disappeared
behind
the
willows
and
she
lost
sight
of
them
the
widow
s
distress
became
so
overpowering
that
she
became
insensible
and
had
to
be
carried
and
laid
on
her
bed
thibault
lavished
upon
her
the
most
devoted
attention
he
was
somewhat
taken
aback
at
the
strong
feeling
of
affection
which
the
widow
evinced
for
his
cousin
however
as
this
only
made
him
applaud
himself
the
more
for
having
cut
at
the
root
of
the
evil
he
still
cherished
the
most
sanguine
hopes
on
coming
to
herself
the
first
name
the
widow
uttered
was
that
of
landry
to
which
thibault
replied
with
a
hypocritical
gesture
of
commiseration
then
the
mistress
of
the
mill
began
to
sob
poor
lad
she
cried
while
the
hot
tears
flowed
down
her
cheeks
what
will
become
of
him
so
weak
and
delicate
as
he
is
the
mere
weight
of
his
gun
and
knapsack
will
kill
him
then
turning
to
her
guest
she
continued
ah
monsieur
thibault
this
is
a
terrible
trouble
to
me
for
you
no
doubt
have
perceived
that
i
love
him
he
was
gentle
he
was
kind
he
had
no
faults
he
was
not
a
gambler
nor
a
drinker
he
would
never
have
opposed
my
wishes
would
never
have
tyrannised
over
his
wife
and
that
would
have
seemed
very
sweet
to
me
after
the
two
cruel
years
that
i
lived
with
the
late
polet
ah
monsieur
thibault
monsieur
thibault
it
is
a
sad
grief
indeed
for
a
poor
miserable
woman
to
see
all
her
anticipations
of
future
happiness
and
peace
thus
suddenly
swallowed
up
thibault
thought
this
would
be
a
good
moment
to
declare
himself
whenever
he
saw
a
woman
crying
he
immediately
thought
most
erroneously
that
she
only
cried
because
she
wished
to
be
consoled
he
decided
however
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
attain
his
object
without
a
certain
circumlocution
indeed
he
answered
i
quite
understand
your
sorrow
nay
more
than
that
i
share
it
with
you
for
you
can
not
doubt
the
affection
i
bear
my
cousin
but
we
must
resign
ourselves
and
without
wishing
to
deny
landry
s
good
qualities
i
would
still
ask
you
madame
to
find
someone
else
who
is
his
his
equal
exclaimed
the
widow
there
is
no
such
person
where
shall
i
find
so
nice
and
so
good
a
youth
it
was
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
his
smooth
young
face
and
with
it
all
he
was
so
so
steady
in
his
habits
he
was
working
night
and
day
and
yet
i
could
with
a
glance
make
him
shrink
away
and
hide
no
no
monsieur
thibault
i
tell
you
frankly
the
remembrance
of
him
will
prevent
me
ever
wishing
to
look
at
another
man
and
i
know
that
i
must
resign
myself
to
remaining
a
widow
for
the
rest
of
my
phew
said
thibault
but
landry
was
very
young
there
is
no
disadvantage
in
that
replied
the
widow
but
who
knows
if
he
would
always
have
retained
his
good
qualities
take
my
advice
madame
do
not
grieve
any
more
but
as
i
say
look
out
for
some
one
who
will
make
you
forget
him
what
you
really
need
is
not
a
like
that
but
a
grown
man
possessing
all
the
qualities
that
you
admire
and
regret
in
landry
but
at
the
same
time
sufficiently
mature
to
prevent
the
chance
of
finding
one
fine
day
that
all
your
illusions
are
dispersed
and
that
you
are
left
face
to
face
with
a
libertine
and
a
the
mistress
of
the
mill
shook
her
head
but
thibault
went
on
in
short
what
you
need
is
a
man
who
while
earning
your
respect
will
at
the
same
time
make
the
mill
work
profitably
you
have
but
to
say
the
word
and
you
would
not
have
to
wait
long
before
you
found
yourself
well
provided
for
my
fair
madame
a
good
bit
better
than
you
were
just
and
where
am
i
to
find
this
miracle
of
a
man
asked
the
widow
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
looking
defiantly
at
the
as
if
throwing
down
a
challenge
the
latter
mistaking
the
tone
in
which
these
last
words
were
said
thought
it
an
excellent
occasion
to
make
known
his
own
proposals
and
accordingly
hastened
to
profit
by
it
well
i
confess
he
answered
that
when
i
said
that
a
handsome
widow
like
you
would
not
have
to
go
far
before
finding
the
man
who
would
be
just
the
very
husband
for
her
i
was
thinking
of
myself
for
i
should
reckon
myself
fortunate
and
should
feel
proud
to
call
myself
your
husband
ah
i
assure
you
he
went
on
while
the
mistress
of
the
mill
stood
looking
at
him
with
displeasure
in
her
eyes
i
assure
you
that
with
me
you
would
have
no
occasion
to
fear
any
opposition
to
your
wishes
i
am
a
perfect
lamb
in
the
way
of
gentleness
and
i
should
have
but
one
law
and
one
desire
my
law
would
be
to
obey
you
my
desire
to
please
you
and
as
to
your
fortune
i
have
means
of
adding
to
it
which
i
will
make
known
to
you
later
on
but
the
end
of
thibault
s
sentence
remained
unspoken
what
cried
the
widow
whose
fury
was
the
greater
for
having
been
kept
in
check
until
then
what
you
whom
i
thought
my
friend
you
dare
to
speak
of
replacing
him
in
my
heart
you
try
to
dissuade
me
from
keeping
my
faith
to
your
cousin
get
out
of
the
place
you
worthless
scoundrel
out
of
the
place
i
say
or
i
will
not
answer
for
the
consequences
i
have
a
good
mind
to
get
four
of
my
men
to
collar
you
and
throw
you
under
the
thibault
was
anxious
to
make
some
sort
of
response
but
although
ready
with
an
answer
on
ordinary
occasions
he
could
not
for
the
moment
think
of
a
single
word
whereby
to
justify
himself
true
madame
polet
gave
him
no
time
to
think
but
seizing
hold
of
a
beautiful
new
jug
that
stood
near
her
she
flung
it
at
thibault
s
head
luckily
for
him
thibault
dodged
to
the
left
and
escaped
the
missile
which
flew
past
him
crashing
to
pieces
against
the
then
the
mistress
of
the
house
took
up
a
stool
and
aimed
it
at
him
with
equal
violence
this
time
thibault
dodged
to
the
right
and
the
stool
went
against
the
window
smashing
two
or
three
panes
of
glass
at
the
sound
of
the
falling
glass
all
the
youths
and
maids
of
the
mill
came
running
up
they
found
their
mistress
flinging
bottles
plates
everything
in
short
that
came
to
hand
with
all
her
might
at
thibault
s
head
fortunately
for
him
widow
polet
was
too
much
incensed
to
be
able
to
speak
if
she
had
been
able
to
do
so
she
would
have
called
out
kill
him
strangle
him
kill
the
rascal
the
scoundrel
the
villain
on
seeing
the
reinforcements
arriving
to
help
the
widow
thibault
endeavoured
to
escape
by
the
door
that
had
been
left
open
by
the
recruiting
party
but
just
as
he
was
running
out
the
good
pig
that
we
saw
taking
its
siesta
in
the
sun
being
roused
out
of
its
first
sleep
by
all
this
hullabaloo
and
thinking
the
farm
people
were
after
it
made
a
dash
for
its
stye
and
in
so
doing
charged
right
against
thibault
s
legs
the
latter
lost
his
balance
and
went
rolling
over
and
over
for
a
good
ten
paces
in
the
dirt
and
slush
devil
take
you
you
beast
cried
the
bruised
by
his
fall
but
even
more
furious
at
seeing
his
new
clothes
covered
with
mud
the
wish
was
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
pig
was
suddenly
taken
with
a
fit
of
frenzy
and
began
rushing
about
the
like
a
mad
animal
breaking
shattering
and
turning
over
everything
that
came
in
its
way
the
farm
hands
who
had
run
to
their
mistress
on
hearing
her
cries
thought
the
pig
s
behaviour
was
the
cause
of
them
and
started
off
in
pursuit
of
the
animal
but
it
eluded
all
their
attempts
to
seize
hold
of
it
knocking
over
boys
and
girls
as
it
had
knocked
thibault
over
until
at
last
coming
to
where
the
mill
was
separated
from
the
sluice
by
a
wooden
partition
it
crashed
through
the
latter
as
easily
as
if
it
were
made
of
paper
threw
itself
under
the
mill
wheel
and
disappeared
as
if
sucked
down
by
a
whirlpool
the
mistress
of
the
mill
had
by
this
time
recovered
her
speech
lay
hold
of
thibault
she
cried
for
she
had
heard
thibault
s
curse
and
had
been
amazed
and
horrified
at
the
instantaneous
way
in
which
it
had
worked
lay
hold
of
him
knock
him
down
he
is
a
wizard
a
sorcerer
a
applying
to
thibault
with
this
last
word
one
of
the
most
terrible
epithets
that
can
be
given
to
a
man
in
our
forest
lands
thibault
who
scarcely
knew
where
he
was
seeing
the
momentary
stupefaction
which
took
possession
of
the
farm
people
on
hearing
their
mistress
s
final
invective
made
use
of
the
opportunity
to
dash
past
them
and
while
one
went
to
get
a
and
another
a
spade
he
darted
through
the
gate
and
began
running
up
an
almost
perpendicular
at
full
speed
with
an
ease
which
only
confirmed
madame
polet
s
suspicions
for
the
hill
had
always
hitherto
been
looked
upon
as
absolutely
inaccessible
at
any
rate
by
the
way
thibault
had
chosen
to
climb
it
what
she
cried
what
you
give
in
like
that
you
should
make
after
him
and
seize
hold
of
him
and
knock
him
down
but
the
farm
servants
shook
their
heads
ah
madame
they
said
what
is
the
use
what
can
we
do
against
a
were
wolf
chapter
ix
the
thibault
fleeing
from
before
madame
polet
s
threats
and
her
farm
servants
weapons
turned
instinctively
towards
the
forest
thinking
to
take
shelter
within
it
should
he
chance
to
come
across
one
of
the
enemy
for
he
knew
that
no
one
would
venture
to
follow
him
there
for
fear
of
any
lurking
dangers
not
that
thibault
had
much
to
fear
whatever
kind
of
enemy
he
met
now
that
he
was
armed
with
the
diabolical
power
which
he
had
received
from
the
wolf
he
had
only
to
send
them
where
he
had
sent
the
widow
s
pig
and
he
was
sure
of
being
rid
of
them
nevertheless
conscious
of
a
certain
tightening
of
the
heart
when
from
time
to
time
the
thought
of
marcotte
came
back
to
him
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
however
anxious
to
be
rid
of
them
one
could
not
send
men
to
the
devil
quite
as
readily
as
one
sent
pigs
while
thus
reflecting
on
the
terrible
power
he
possessed
and
looking
back
at
intervals
to
see
if
there
were
any
immediate
need
to
put
it
into
use
thibault
by
the
time
night
fell
had
reached
the
rear
of
pisseleu
it
was
an
autumn
night
dark
and
stormy
with
a
wind
that
tore
the
yellowing
leaves
from
the
trees
and
wandered
through
the
forest
ways
with
melancholy
sighs
and
moanings
these
funereal
voices
of
the
wind
were
interrupted
from
time
to
time
by
the
hooting
of
the
owls
which
sounded
like
the
cries
of
lost
travellers
hailing
one
another
but
all
these
sounds
were
familiar
to
thibault
and
made
very
little
impression
upon
him
moreover
he
had
taken
the
precaution
on
first
entering
the
forest
of
cutting
a
stick
four
feet
long
from
a
chestnut
tree
and
adept
as
he
was
with
the
quarterstaff
he
was
ready
armed
thus
to
withstand
the
attack
of
any
four
men
so
he
entered
the
forest
with
all
boldness
of
heart
at
the
spot
which
is
known
to
this
day
as
the
wolf
s
heath
he
had
been
walking
for
some
minutes
along
a
dark
and
narrow
glade
cursing
as
he
went
the
foolish
whims
of
women
who
for
no
reason
whatever
preferred
a
weak
and
timid
child
to
a
brave
strong
full
grown
man
when
all
of
a
sudden
at
some
few
paces
behind
him
he
heard
a
crackling
among
the
leaves
he
turned
and
the
first
thing
he
could
distinguish
in
the
darkness
was
the
glowing
light
in
a
pair
of
eyes
which
shone
like
live
coals
then
looking
more
closely
and
forcing
his
eyes
so
to
speak
to
penetrate
the
gloom
he
saw
that
a
great
wolf
was
following
him
step
by
step
but
it
was
not
the
wolf
that
he
had
entertained
in
his
hut
that
was
black
while
this
was
a
there
was
no
mistaking
one
for
the
other
either
as
to
colour
or
size
as
thibault
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
all
the
wolves
he
came
across
would
be
animated
with
such
benevolent
feelings
towards
him
as
the
first
with
which
he
had
had
dealings
he
grasped
his
quarterstaff
in
both
hands
and
began
twirling
it
about
to
make
sure
he
had
not
forgotten
the
knack
of
using
it
but
to
his
great
surprise
the
wolf
went
on
trotting
quietly
behind
him
without
evincing
any
hostile
intention
pausing
when
he
paused
and
going
on
again
when
he
did
only
now
and
then
giving
a
howl
as
if
to
summon
thibault
was
not
altogether
without
uneasiness
as
regards
these
occasional
howls
and
presently
he
became
aware
of
two
other
bright
spots
of
light
in
front
of
him
shining
at
intervals
through
the
darkness
which
was
growing
thicker
and
thicker
holding
his
stick
up
in
readiness
to
hit
he
went
forward
towards
these
two
lights
which
remained
stationary
and
as
he
did
so
his
foot
seemed
to
stumble
against
something
lying
across
the
path
it
was
another
wolf
not
pausing
to
reflect
whether
it
might
not
be
unwise
now
to
attack
the
first
wolf
thibault
brought
down
his
staff
giving
the
fellow
a
violent
blow
on
the
head
the
animal
uttered
a
howl
of
pain
then
shaking
his
ears
like
a
dog
that
has
been
beaten
by
its
master
began
walking
on
in
front
of
the
thibault
then
turned
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
first
wolf
it
was
still
following
him
still
keeping
step
with
him
bringing
his
eyes
back
again
to
the
front
he
now
perceived
that
a
third
wolf
was
walking
alongside
to
the
right
and
turning
instinctively
to
the
left
saw
a
fourth
flanking
him
on
that
side
too
before
he
had
gone
a
mile
a
dozen
of
the
animals
had
formed
a
circle
round
him
the
situation
was
critical
and
thibault
was
fully
conscious
of
its
gravity
at
first
he
tried
to
sing
hoping
that
the
sound
of
the
human
voice
might
frighten
away
the
animals
but
the
expedient
was
vain
not
a
single
animal
swerved
from
its
place
in
the
circle
which
was
as
exactly
formed
as
if
drawn
with
compasses
then
he
thought
he
would
climb
up
into
the
first
tree
he
came
to
and
there
wait
for
daylight
but
on
further
deliberation
he
decided
that
the
wisest
course
was
to
try
to
get
home
as
the
wolves
in
spite
of
their
number
still
appeared
as
well
intentioned
as
when
there
was
only
one
it
would
be
time
enough
to
climb
up
into
a
tree
when
they
began
to
show
signs
of
any
change
of
behaviour
towards
him
at
the
same
time
we
are
bound
to
add
that
thibault
was
so
disquieted
in
mind
and
that
he
had
reached
his
own
door
before
he
knew
where
he
was
he
did
not
at
first
recognise
his
own
house
but
a
still
greater
surprise
awaited
him
for
the
wolves
who
were
in
front
now
respectfully
drew
back
into
two
lines
sitting
up
on
their
hind
legs
and
making
a
lane
for
him
to
pass
along
thibault
did
not
waste
time
in
stopping
to
thank
them
for
this
act
of
courtesy
but
dashed
into
the
house
banging
the
door
to
after
him
having
firmly
shut
and
bolted
the
door
he
pushed
the
great
chest
against
it
that
it
might
be
better
able
to
resist
any
assault
that
might
be
made
upon
it
then
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
and
began
at
length
to
find
himself
able
to
breathe
more
freely
as
soon
as
he
was
somewhat
recovered
he
went
and
peeped
through
the
little
window
that
looked
out
on
the
forest
a
row
of
gleaming
eyes
assured
him
that
far
from
having
retired
the
wolves
had
arranged
themselves
symmetrically
in
file
in
front
of
his
dwelling
to
anyone
else
the
mere
proximity
of
the
animals
would
have
been
most
alarming
but
thibault
who
shortly
before
had
been
obliged
to
walk
escorted
by
this
terrible
troop
found
comfort
in
the
thought
that
a
wall
however
thin
now
separated
him
from
his
formidable
companions
thibault
lit
his
little
iron
lamp
and
put
it
on
the
table
drew
the
scattered
of
his
hearth
together
and
threw
on
them
a
bundle
of
chips
and
then
made
a
good
fire
hoping
that
the
reflection
of
the
blaze
would
frighten
away
the
wolves
but
thibault
s
wolves
were
evidently
wolves
of
a
special
sort
accustomed
to
fire
for
they
did
not
budge
an
inch
from
the
post
they
had
taken
up
the
state
of
uneasiness
he
was
in
prevented
thibault
from
sleeping
and
directly
dawn
broke
he
was
able
to
look
out
and
count
them
they
seemed
just
as
on
the
night
before
to
be
waiting
some
seated
some
lying
down
others
sleeping
or
walking
up
and
down
like
sentinels
but
at
length
as
the
last
star
melted
away
drowned
in
the
waves
of
purple
light
ebbing
up
from
the
east
all
the
wolves
with
one
accord
rose
and
uttering
the
mournful
howl
with
which
animals
of
darkness
are
wont
to
salute
the
day
they
dispersed
in
various
directions
and
disappeared
thibault
was
now
able
to
sit
down
and
think
over
the
misadventure
of
the
previous
day
and
he
began
by
asking
himself
how
it
was
that
the
mistress
of
the
mill
had
not
preferred
him
to
his
cousin
landry
was
he
no
longer
the
handsome
thibault
or
had
some
disadvantageous
change
come
over
his
personal
appearance
there
was
only
one
way
of
ascertaining
whether
this
was
so
or
not
namely
by
consulting
his
mirror
so
he
took
down
the
fragment
of
hanging
over
the
and
carried
it
towards
the
light
smiling
to
himself
the
while
like
a
vain
woman
but
he
had
hardly
given
the
first
glance
at
himself
in
the
mirror
before
he
uttered
a
cry
half
of
astonishment
half
of
horror
true
he
was
still
the
handsome
thibault
but
the
one
red
hair
thanks
to
the
hasty
wishes
which
had
so
imprudently
escaped
him
had
now
grown
to
a
regular
lock
of
hair
of
a
colour
and
brilliancy
that
vied
with
the
brightest
flames
upon
his
hearth
his
forehead
grew
cold
with
sweat
knowing
however
that
all
attempts
to
pluck
it
out
or
cut
it
off
would
be
futile
he
made
up
his
mind
to
make
the
best
of
the
matter
as
it
stood
and
in
future
to
forbear
as
far
as
possible
from
framing
any
wishes
the
best
thing
was
to
put
out
of
his
mind
all
the
ambitious
desires
that
had
worked
so
fatally
for
him
and
go
back
to
his
humble
trade
so
thibault
sat
down
and
tried
to
work
but
he
had
no
heart
for
the
job
in
vain
he
tried
to
remember
the
carols
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
singing
in
the
happier
days
when
the
beech
and
the
birch
shaped
themselves
so
quickly
beneath
his
fingers
his
tools
lay
untouched
for
hours
together
he
pondered
over
matters
asking
himself
whether
it
was
not
a
miserable
thing
to
be
sweating
one
s
heart
out
merely
for
the
privilege
of
leading
a
painful
and
wretched
existence
when
by
judiciously
directing
one
s
wishes
one
might
so
easily
attain
to
happiness
formerly
even
the
preparation
of
his
frugal
meal
had
been
an
agreeable
distraction
but
it
was
so
no
longer
when
hunger
seized
him
and
he
was
forced
to
eat
his
piece
of
black
bread
he
did
it
with
a
feeling
of
repugnance
and
the
envy
which
had
hitherto
been
nothing
more
than
a
vague
aspiration
after
ease
and
comfort
was
now
developed
into
a
blind
and
violent
hatred
towards
his
fellow
creatures
still
the
day
long
as
it
seemed
to
thibault
passed
away
like
all
its
fellows
when
twilight
fell
he
went
outside
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
which
he
had
made
himself
and
placed
in
front
of
the
door
and
there
he
remained
lost
in
gloomy
reflections
scarcely
had
the
shadows
begun
to
darken
before
a
wolf
emerged
from
the
underwood
and
as
on
the
previous
evening
went
and
lay
down
at
a
short
distance
from
the
house
as
on
the
evening
before
this
wolf
was
followed
by
a
second
by
a
third
in
short
by
the
whole
pack
and
once
more
they
all
took
up
their
respective
posts
preparatory
to
the
night
s
watch
as
soon
as
thibault
saw
the
third
wolf
appear
he
went
indoors
and
barricaded
himself
in
as
carefully
as
the
evening
before
but
this
evening
he
was
even
more
unhappy
and
low
spirited
and
felt
that
he
had
not
the
strength
to
keep
awake
all
night
so
he
lighted
his
fire
and
piled
it
up
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
last
till
the
morning
and
throwing
himself
on
his
bed
fell
fast
asleep
when
he
awoke
it
was
broad
daylight
the
sun
having
risen
some
hours
before
its
rays
fell
in
many
colours
on
the
quivering
autumn
leaves
dyeing
them
with
a
thousand
shades
of
gold
and
purple
thibault
ran
to
the
window
the
wolves
had
disappeared
leaving
behind
only
the
mark
of
where
their
bodies
had
lain
on
the
grass
next
evening
they
again
congregated
before
his
dwelling
but
he
was
now
growing
gradually
accustomed
to
their
presence
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
his
relations
with
the
large
black
wolf
had
somehow
awakened
sympathetic
feelings
towards
him
in
all
other
individuals
of
the
same
species
and
he
determined
to
find
out
once
for
all
what
their
designs
towards
him
really
were
accordingly
thrusting
a
freshly
sharpened
into
his
belt
and
taking
his
in
his
hand
the
opened
his
door
and
walked
resolutely
out
to
face
them
having
half
expected
that
they
would
spring
upon
him
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
them
begin
to
wag
their
tails
like
so
many
dogs
on
seeing
their
master
approach
their
greetings
were
so
expressive
of
friendliness
that
thibault
even
ventured
to
stroke
one
or
two
of
them
on
the
back
which
they
not
only
allowed
him
to
do
but
actually
gave
signs
of
the
greatest
pleasure
at
being
thus
noticed
oh
ho
muttered
thibault
whose
wandering
imagination
always
went
ahead
at
a
gallop
if
these
queer
friends
of
mine
are
as
obedient
as
they
are
gentle
why
here
i
am
the
owner
of
a
pack
unequalled
by
any
my
lord
baron
has
ever
possessed
and
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
whatever
now
in
dining
on
venison
whenever
the
fancy
so
takes
he
had
hardly
said
the
words
when
four
of
the
strongest
and
most
alert
of
the
beasts
separated
themselves
from
the
others
and
galloped
off
into
the
forest
a
few
minutes
later
a
howl
was
heard
sounding
from
the
depths
of
the
underwood
and
half
an
hour
afterwards
one
of
the
wolves
reappeared
dragging
with
it
a
fine
kid
which
left
behind
it
a
long
trail
of
blood
on
the
grass
the
wolf
laid
the
animal
at
thibault
s
feet
who
delighted
beyond
measure
at
seeing
his
wishes
not
only
accomplished
but
forestalled
broke
up
the
kid
giving
each
of
the
wolves
an
equal
share
and
keeping
the
back
and
haunches
for
himself
then
with
the
gesture
of
an
emperor
which
showed
that
he
now
at
last
understood
the
position
he
held
he
ordered
the
wolves
away
until
the
morrow
early
next
morning
before
the
day
broke
he
went
off
to
and
at
the
price
of
a
couple
of
crowns
the
innkeeper
of
the
took
the
two
haunches
off
his
hands
the
following
day
it
was
half
of
a
boar
that
thibault
conveyed
to
the
innkeeper
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
became
the
latter
s
chief
purveyor
thibault
taking
a
taste
for
this
sort
of
business
now
passed
his
whole
day
hanging
about
the
taverns
and
gave
no
more
thought
to
the
making
of
shoes
one
or
two
of
his
acquaintances
began
to
make
fun
of
his
red
lock
for
however
assiduously
he
covered
it
with
the
rest
of
his
hair
it
always
found
a
way
of
getting
through
the
curls
that
hid
it
and
making
itself
visible
but
thibault
soon
gave
it
plainly
to
be
understood
that
he
would
take
no
joking
about
the
unfortunate
disfigurement
meanwhile
as
ill
luck
would
have
it
the
duke
of
orleans
and
madame
de
montesson
came
to
spend
a
few
days
at
this
was
a
fresh
incentive
to
thibault
s
madly
ambitious
spirit
all
the
fine
and
beautiful
ladies
and
all
the
gay
young
lords
from
the
neighbouring
estates
the
montbretons
the
montesquious
the
courvals
hastened
to
the
ladies
brought
their
richest
attire
the
young
lords
their
most
elegant
costumes
the
baron
s
resounded
through
the
forest
louder
and
gayer
than
ever
graceful
amazons
and
dashing
cavaliers
in
red
coats
laced
with
gold
passed
like
radiant
visions
as
they
were
borne
along
on
their
magnificent
english
horses
illuminating
the
sombre
depths
of
the
wood
like
brilliant
flashes
of
light
in
the
evening
it
was
different
then
all
this
aristocratic
company
assembled
for
feasting
and
dancing
or
at
other
times
drove
out
in
beautiful
gilt
carriages
bedizened
with
coats
of
arms
of
every
colour
thibault
always
took
his
stand
in
the
front
rank
of
the
gazing
with
avidity
on
these
clouds
of
satin
and
lace
which
lifted
now
and
then
to
disclose
the
delicate
ankles
encased
in
their
fine
silk
stockings
and
the
little
shoes
with
their
red
heels
thus
the
whole
cavalcade
swept
past
in
front
of
the
astonished
peasantry
leaving
a
faint
exhalation
of
scent
and
powder
and
delicate
perfumes
and
then
thibault
would
ask
himself
why
he
was
not
one
of
those
young
lords
in
their
embroidered
coats
why
he
had
not
one
of
these
beautiful
women
in
their
rustling
satins
for
his
mistress
then
his
thoughts
would
turn
to
agnelette
and
madame
polet
and
he
saw
them
just
as
they
were
the
one
a
poor
little
peasant
girl
the
other
nothing
more
than
the
owner
of
a
rustic
mill
but
it
was
when
he
was
walking
home
at
night
through
the
forest
accompanied
by
his
pack
of
wolves
which
from
the
moment
the
night
fell
and
he
set
foot
inside
the
forest
no
more
thought
of
leaving
him
than
the
king
s
bodyguard
would
dream
of
leaving
their
royal
master
that
his
broodings
took
their
most
disastrous
turn
surrounded
by
the
temptations
which
now
assailed
him
it
was
only
what
was
to
be
expected
that
thibault
who
had
already
gone
so
far
in
the
direction
of
evil
should
break
away
from
what
little
good
was
still
left
in
him
losing
even
the
very
remembrance
of
having
once
led
an
honest
life
what
were
the
few
paltry
crowns
that
the
landlord
of
the
gave
him
in
payment
for
the
game
which
his
good
friends
the
wolves
procured
for
him
saved
up
for
months
even
for
years
they
would
still
be
insufficient
to
satisfy
a
single
one
of
the
humblest
of
the
desires
which
kept
tormenting
his
brain
it
would
be
scarcely
safe
to
say
that
thibault
who
had
first
wished
for
a
haunch
of
the
baron
s
buck
then
for
agnelette
s
heart
and
then
for
the
widow
polet
s
mill
would
now
be
satisfied
even
with
the
castle
at
oigny
or
longpont
to
such
extravagant
issues
had
his
ambition
been
excited
by
those
dainty
feet
those
trim
ankles
those
exquisite
scents
exhaled
from
all
those
velvet
and
satin
gowns
at
last
one
day
he
said
to
himself
definitely
that
it
would
be
the
veriest
folly
to
go
on
living
his
poor
life
when
a
power
so
tremendous
as
he
now
possessed
was
at
his
disposal
from
that
moment
he
made
up
his
mind
that
no
matter
if
his
hair
should
grow
as
red
as
the
crown
of
fire
which
is
seen
at
night
hanging
over
the
great
chimney
at
the
glass
works
of
saint
gobain
he
would
exercise
this
power
of
his
to
the
accomplishing
of
the
most
of
his
ambitions
chapter
x
maitre
magloire
in
this
reckless
state
of
mind
thibault
who
had
not
as
yet
decided
on
any
special
course
of
action
spent
the
last
days
of
the
old
year
and
the
first
of
the
new
still
remembering
the
heavy
expenses
entailed
on
each
and
all
by
new
year
s
day
he
had
exacted
double
rations
from
his
usual
purveyor
s
as
the
trying
time
drew
nearer
and
nearer
simultaneously
drawing
double
profits
from
the
landlord
of
the
thus
it
came
about
that
apart
from
the
disquieting
fact
that
his
mesh
of
red
hair
was
getting
larger
and
larger
almost
every
day
thibault
entered
upon
the
new
year
in
a
better
condition
as
to
material
matters
than
he
had
ever
known
before
observe
i
say
as
to
matters
and
material
matters
only
for
albeit
the
body
might
seem
in
good
plight
the
soul
was
already
alarmingly
compromised
the
body
at
any
rate
was
well
clothed
and
ten
crowns
or
more
made
a
merry
jingling
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
so
dressed
and
so
accompanied
by
this
silvery
music
thibault
no
longer
appeared
like
a
wooden
s
apprentice
but
like
some
farmer
or
even
a
comfortable
citizen
carrying
on
a
trade
maybe
but
simply
for
his
own
pleasure
looking
such
as
he
now
did
thibault
went
to
one
of
those
village
functions
which
are
for
the
whole
province
the
magnificent
ponds
of
berval
and
poudron
were
to
be
drawn
now
the
drawing
of
a
pond
is
a
grand
affair
for
the
owner
or
for
the
one
who
farms
it
not
to
mention
the
great
pleasure
it
affords
to
the
spectators
such
an
event
therefore
is
advertised
a
month
in
advance
and
people
come
from
thirty
miles
round
to
enjoy
this
fine
entertainment
and
to
those
of
my
readers
who
are
not
accustomed
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
provinces
let
me
explain
that
the
fishing
which
takes
place
is
not
a
fishing
with
the
line
baited
with
worms
or
scented
wheat
or
with
the
or
the
nothing
of
the
kind
this
fishing
consists
in
emptying
a
pond
sometimes
nearly
a
mile
or
even
three
miles
long
of
every
fish
from
the
largest
pike
to
the
smallest
minnow
this
is
how
the
thing
is
managed
in
all
probability
not
a
single
one
of
my
readers
has
ever
seen
the
kind
of
pond
to
which
i
refer
i
will
describe
it
to
begin
with
it
always
has
two
issues
that
by
which
the
water
flows
in
that
by
which
the
water
flows
out
that
by
which
the
water
enters
has
no
particular
name
that
by
which
it
is
let
out
is
called
the
sluice
the
water
as
it
leaves
the
sluice
falls
into
a
large
reservoir
whence
it
escapes
through
the
meshes
of
a
strong
net
the
water
flows
away
but
the
fish
remain
everyone
knows
that
it
takes
several
days
to
empty
a
pond
therefore
those
who
wish
to
take
a
share
in
the
fishing
and
the
onlookers
are
not
summoned
to
attend
before
the
second
third
or
fourth
day
according
to
the
volume
of
water
which
the
pond
has
to
disgorge
before
it
is
ready
for
the
final
act
and
this
takes
place
as
soon
as
the
fish
appear
at
the
sluice
at
the
hour
announced
for
the
fishing
a
crowd
assembles
varying
in
number
according
to
the
size
and
the
celebrity
of
the
pond
but
comparatively
as
large
and
as
fashionable
as
that
to
be
seen
at
the
champ
de
mars
or
chantilly
on
race
days
when
favourite
horses
are
to
run
and
favourite
jockeys
to
ride
only
here
the
spectators
do
not
look
on
from
grand
stands
and
carriages
on
the
contrary
they
come
as
they
can
or
as
they
like
in
gigs
pleasure
vans
phaëtons
carts
on
on
but
once
on
the
spot
everyone
rushes
to
find
a
place
stationing
him
or
herself
either
in
order
of
arrival
or
according
to
the
amount
of
elbowing
and
pushing
of
which
each
is
capable
always
however
with
that
due
respect
for
authority
which
is
observed
even
in
the
least
civilised
districts
a
sort
of
stout
however
firmly
sunk
into
the
ground
prevents
the
onlookers
from
falling
into
the
reservoir
the
colour
and
the
smell
of
the
water
betoken
the
arrival
of
the
fish
every
kind
of
show
has
its
drawbacks
the
larger
and
grander
the
audience
at
the
opera
house
the
more
carbonic
acid
is
there
to
draw
into
the
lungs
at
the
drawing
of
a
pond
the
nearer
the
supreme
moment
approaches
the
more
is
there
to
inhale
when
the
sluice
is
first
opened
the
water
that
pours
through
is
beautifully
clear
and
slightly
green
in
colour
like
the
water
of
a
brook
this
is
the
upper
layer
which
carried
along
by
its
weight
is
the
first
to
appear
by
degrees
the
water
becomes
less
transparent
and
takes
on
a
greyish
hue
this
is
the
second
layer
emptying
itself
in
turn
and
every
now
and
then
more
frequently
as
the
water
becomes
muddier
a
ray
of
silver
is
seen
to
dart
through
it
it
is
some
fish
too
small
and
weak
to
resist
the
current
which
flashes
past
as
if
acting
as
scout
for
its
stronger
brethren
nobody
troubles
to
pick
it
up
it
is
allowed
to
lie
gasping
and
trying
to
find
some
little
stagnant
puddle
of
water
at
the
bottom
of
the
pond
flapping
floundering
and
capering
like
an
acrobat
going
through
his
antics
then
the
black
water
comes
pouring
through
this
is
the
last
act
the
final
catastrophe
each
fish
according
to
its
power
of
resistance
struggles
against
the
current
which
is
bearing
it
along
in
this
unusual
manner
instinctively
they
feel
there
is
danger
and
each
strives
its
hardest
to
swim
in
an
opposite
direction
the
pike
struggles
beside
the
carp
which
it
was
yesterday
pursuing
so
hard
the
perch
is
reconciled
to
the
tench
and
as
they
swim
side
by
side
does
not
so
much
as
think
of
taking
a
bite
out
of
the
flesh
he
finds
so
palatable
at
other
times
so
the
arabs
at
times
find
huddled
together
in
the
pits
they
dig
to
catch
game
gazelles
and
jackals
antelopes
and
hyenas
the
jackals
and
hyenas
having
grown
as
gentle
and
as
timid
as
the
gazelles
and
antelopes
but
the
strength
of
the
struggling
and
dying
fish
begins
at
last
to
fail
the
scouts
that
we
noticed
a
few
minutes
ago
become
more
numerous
the
size
of
the
fish
becomes
more
respectable
which
is
proved
to
them
by
the
attention
they
receive
from
the
these
are
men
clad
in
plain
linen
trousers
and
cotton
shirts
the
trousers
are
rolled
up
to
above
the
knee
and
the
shirt
sleeves
turned
up
to
the
shoulders
the
fish
are
gathered
up
in
baskets
those
destined
to
be
sold
alive
or
kept
for
the
pond
are
poured
off
into
tanks
those
condemned
to
death
are
simply
spread
out
on
the
grass
and
will
be
sold
before
the
day
is
out
as
the
fish
grow
more
and
more
abundant
the
cries
of
delight
from
the
spectators
become
louder
and
more
frequent
for
these
onlookers
are
not
like
the
audiences
in
our
theatres
they
have
no
idea
of
stifling
their
feelings
or
showing
good
taste
by
appearing
indifferent
no
they
come
to
amuse
themselves
and
every
fine
tench
or
fine
carp
or
fine
pike
calls
forth
loud
undisguised
and
delighted
applause
as
in
a
review
the
troops
file
past
in
order
according
to
their
weight
if
we
may
use
the
expression
first
the
fight
then
the
somewhat
heavier
dragoons
and
finally
the
ponderous
cuirassiers
and
heavy
artillery
to
bring
up
the
rear
so
the
fish
sweep
by
according
to
their
several
species
the
smallest
that
is
the
weakest
first
the
heaviest
that
is
the
strongest
last
at
last
the
moment
comes
when
the
water
ceases
to
flow
the
passage
is
literally
obstructed
by
the
remainder
of
the
fish
the
of
the
pond
and
the
have
veritable
monsters
to
fight
with
this
is
the
supreme
moment
now
comes
the
climax
of
applause
the
last
vociferous
bravos
then
the
play
being
over
everyone
goes
to
examine
the
actors
the
latter
are
mostly
lying
gasping
to
death
on
the
grass
of
the
field
while
a
certain
number
are
recovering
themselves
in
the
water
you
look
about
for
the
eels
where
are
the
eels
you
ask
then
three
or
four
eels
about
as
big
round
as
your
thumb
and
half
the
length
of
your
arm
are
pointed
out
to
you
for
the
eels
thanks
to
their
peculiar
organization
have
momentarily
at
least
escaped
the
general
carnage
the
eels
have
taken
a
header
into
the
mud
and
disappeared
and
this
is
the
reason
why
you
may
see
men
with
guns
walking
up
and
down
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
and
hear
a
report
from
time
to
time
if
you
ask
the
reason
for
this
shooting
you
will
be
told
that
it
is
to
bring
the
eels
out
of
their
but
why
do
eels
come
out
of
the
mud
when
they
hear
the
report
of
a
gun
why
do
they
make
for
the
water
which
still
runs
in
little
rivulets
at
the
bottom
of
the
pond
why
in
short
being
safe
at
the
bottom
of
the
mud
like
other
good
friends
of
our
acquaintance
who
have
the
good
sense
to
remain
there
do
the
eels
not
stay
there
instead
of
wriggling
back
into
a
stream
of
water
which
carries
them
along
with
it
and
finally
lands
them
in
the
reservoir
that
is
in
the
common
grave
the
de
would
find
nothing
easier
than
to
answer
this
question
under
existing
circumstances
so
i
put
this
question
to
its
learned
members
is
not
the
idea
of
the
gun
a
pure
superstition
and
is
not
the
following
solution
the
right
and
simple
one
the
mud
in
which
the
eel
takes
refuge
is
at
first
liquid
but
gradually
becomes
drier
and
drier
like
a
sponge
when
squeezed
and
so
becomes
more
and
more
uninhabitable
for
it
and
so
in
the
long
run
it
is
obliged
to
get
back
to
its
natural
element
the
water
the
water
once
reached
the
eel
is
lost
but
it
is
not
till
the
fifth
or
sixth
day
after
the
emptying
of
the
pond
that
the
eels
are
caught
it
was
to
a
fête
of
this
kind
that
everyone
at
at
crespy
at
and
in
the
surrounding
villages
had
been
invited
thibault
went
like
everybody
else
he
had
now
no
need
to
work
finding
it
simpler
to
allow
the
wolves
to
work
for
him
from
a
workman
he
had
risen
to
be
a
man
at
ease
it
now
only
remained
to
make
himself
a
gentleman
and
thibault
counted
upon
being
able
to
do
this
he
was
not
a
man
to
allow
himself
to
remain
in
the
rear
and
he
therefore
made
good
use
of
his
arms
and
legs
so
as
to
secure
a
place
in
the
front
row
in
the
course
of
this
manœuvre
he
happened
to
rumple
the
dress
of
a
tall
fine
woman
next
to
whom
he
was
trying
to
instal
himself
the
lady
was
fond
of
her
clothes
and
no
doubt
also
she
was
in
the
habit
of
commanding
which
naturally
produces
an
attitude
of
disdain
for
turning
to
see
who
had
brushed
past
her
she
let
fall
the
uncompromising
word
lout
notwithstanding
the
rudeness
of
the
remark
the
mouth
that
uttered
the
words
was
so
beautiful
the
lady
so
pretty
and
her
momentary
anger
in
such
ugly
contrast
to
the
charming
expression
of
her
face
that
thibault
instead
of
retorting
in
similar
or
even
more
objectionable
style
only
drew
back
stammering
some
sort
of
excuse
there
is
no
need
to
remind
the
reader
that
of
all
aristocracies
beauty
is
still
the
chief
if
the
woman
had
been
old
and
ugly
she
might
have
been
a
marquise
but
thibault
would
certainly
have
called
her
by
some
opprobrious
title
it
is
possible
also
that
thibault
s
ideas
were
somewhat
distracted
by
the
strange
appearance
of
the
man
who
served
as
knight
to
this
lady
he
was
a
stout
man
of
about
sixty
years
of
age
dressed
entirely
in
black
and
of
a
perfectly
dazzling
exactness
of
toilet
but
therewith
so
extremely
short
that
his
head
scarcely
reached
the
lady
s
elbow
and
as
she
would
have
been
unable
to
take
his
arm
without
positive
torture
to
herself
she
was
content
to
lean
majestically
upon
his
shoulder
seeing
them
thus
together
one
might
have
taken
her
for
an
ancient
cybele
leaning
on
one
of
those
grotesque
little
modern
figures
of
chinese
idols
and
what
a
fascinating
idol
it
was
with
those
short
legs
that
bulgy
stomach
those
little
fat
podgy
arms
those
white
hands
under
the
lace
ruffles
that
plump
rubicund
head
and
face
that
head
of
hair
and
that
tiny
pigtail
which
with
every
movement
of
its
wearer
s
went
bobbing
up
and
down
with
its
neat
bow
of
ribbon
against
the
coat
collar
it
reminded
one
of
those
black
beetles
of
which
the
legs
seem
so
little
in
harmony
with
the
body
that
the
insects
seem
rather
to
roll
than
to
walk
and
with
it
all
the
face
was
so
jovial
the
little
eyes
level
with
the
forehead
were
so
full
of
kindness
that
one
felt
involuntarily
drawn
towards
him
one
could
be
sure
that
the
pleasant
little
man
was
too
intent
on
giving
himself
a
good
time
by
every
means
in
his
power
to
think
of
quarrelling
with
that
vague
and
indefinite
person
known
as
one
s
neighbour
wherefore
on
hearing
his
companion
speak
so
cavalierly
to
thibault
the
good
fat
little
man
appeared
to
be
in
despair
gently
madame
magloire
gently
madame
bailiff
he
said
contriving
in
these
few
words
to
let
his
neighbours
know
what
and
who
he
was
gently
those
were
ugly
words
to
use
to
the
poor
fellow
who
is
more
sorry
than
you
are
for
the
and
may
i
ask
monsieur
magloire
replied
the
lady
if
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
thank
him
for
so
nicely
crumpling
my
beautiful
blue
damask
dress
which
is
now
entirely
spoilt
not
taking
into
consideration
that
he
also
trod
on
my
little
toe
i
beg
you
madame
to
pardon
my
clumsiness
replied
thibault
when
you
turned
your
face
towards
me
its
wonderful
beauty
dazzled
me
like
a
ray
of
may
sunshine
so
that
i
could
not
see
where
i
was
it
was
not
a
badly
turned
compliment
for
a
man
who
for
three
months
past
had
been
in
the
daily
society
of
a
pack
of
wolves
nevertheless
it
did
not
produce
any
great
effect
upon
the
lady
who
only
responded
with
a
haughty
little
pouting
of
the
mouth
the
truth
was
that
in
spite
of
thibault
being
so
decently
dressed
she
had
with
the
curious
insight
which
women
of
all
ranks
possess
in
these
matters
detected
at
once
to
what
class
he
belonged
her
stout
little
companion
however
was
more
indulgent
for
he
clapped
loudly
with
his
podgy
hands
which
the
pose
adopted
by
his
wife
left
him
free
to
use
as
he
liked
ah
bravo
bravo
he
said
you
have
hit
the
mark
monsieur
you
are
a
clever
young
fellow
and
seem
to
have
studied
the
style
to
address
women
in
my
love
i
hope
you
appreciated
the
compliment
as
i
did
and
to
prove
to
this
gentlemen
that
we
are
good
christians
and
bear
no
towards
him
he
will
i
hope
if
he
is
living
in
this
neighbourhood
and
it
would
not
be
too
far
out
of
his
way
accompany
us
home
and
we
will
drink
a
bottle
of
old
wine
together
if
perrine
will
get
one
out
for
us
from
the
back
of
the
wood
ah
there
i
know
you
master
népomucène
any
excuse
serves
you
to
be
clinking
glasses
with
somebody
and
when
no
genuine
occasion
offers
you
are
very
clever
at
ferreting
out
one
it
does
not
matter
where
but
you
know
monsieur
magloire
that
the
doctor
has
expressly
forbidden
you
to
drink
between
true
madame
bailiff
true
replied
her
husband
but
he
did
not
forbid
me
to
show
politeness
to
an
agreeable
young
fellow
such
as
monsieur
appears
to
me
to
be
be
lenient
i
pray
suzanne
give
up
this
surly
manner
which
suits
you
so
why
madame
those
who
do
not
know
you
would
think
to
hear
you
that
we
had
nearly
got
to
quarrelling
over
a
gown
however
to
prove
the
contrary
to
monsieur
i
promise
that
if
you
can
get
him
to
go
back
with
us
i
will
the
very
minute
we
get
home
give
you
the
money
to
buy
that
figured
silk
dress
which
you
have
been
wishing
for
so
the
effect
of
this
promise
was
like
magic
madame
magloire
was
instantly
mollified
and
as
the
fishing
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
she
accepted
with
less
ungraciousness
the
arm
which
thibault
somewhat
awkwardly
we
must
confess
now
offered
her
as
to
thibault
himself
struck
with
the
beauty
of
the
lady
and
gathering
from
words
which
had
fallen
from
her
and
her
husband
that
she
was
the
wife
of
a
magistrate
he
parted
the
crowd
before
him
with
an
air
of
command
holding
his
head
high
the
while
and
making
his
way
with
as
much
determination
as
if
he
were
starting
on
the
conquest
of
the
golden
fleece
and
in
truth
thibault
the
bridegroom
elect
of
agnelette
the
lover
who
had
been
so
ignominiously
expelled
her
house
by
the
mistress
of
the
mill
was
thinking
not
only
of
all
the
pleasure
he
could
enjoy
but
of
the
proud
position
he
would
hold
as
the
beloved
of
a
bailiff
s
wife
and
of
all
the
advantages
to
be
drawn
from
the
good
fortune
which
had
so
unexpectedly
befallen
him
and
which
he
had
so
long
desired
as
on
her
side
also
madame
magloire
was
not
only
very
much
preoccupied
with
her
own
thoughts
but
also
paid
very
little
attention
to
him
looking
to
right
and
left
first
in
front
of
her
and
then
behind
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
the
conversation
would
have
lagged
terribly
as
they
walked
along
if
their
excellent
little
companion
had
not
been
at
the
expense
of
the
best
part
of
it
as
he
jogged
along
now
beside
thibault
and
now
beside
suzanne
waddling
like
a
duck
jogging
home
after
a
big
feed
and
so
with
thibault
engaged
in
his
calculations
and
the
bailiff
s
wife
with
her
dreams
the
bailiff
trotting
beside
them
talking
and
wiping
his
forehead
with
a
fine
cambric
they
arrived
at
the
village
of
erneville
which
is
situated
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
poudron
ponds
it
was
here
in
this
charming
village
which
lies
between
haramont
and
bonneuil
within
a
stone
s
throw
or
two
of
the
castle
of
vez
the
dwelling
of
my
lord
the
baron
that
monsieur
magloire
sat
as
magistrate
chapter
xi
david
and
goliath
after
walking
the
whole
length
of
the
village
they
stopped
before
an
imposing
looking
house
at
the
junction
of
the
roads
leading
to
longpré
and
haramont
as
they
neared
the
house
the
little
host
with
all
the
gallantry
of
a
preux
chevalier
went
on
ahead
mounted
the
flight
of
five
or
six
steps
with
an
agility
which
one
could
not
have
expected
and
by
dint
of
standing
on
managed
to
reach
the
bell
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
it
should
be
added
that
having
once
got
hold
of
it
he
gave
it
a
pull
which
unmistakeably
announced
the
return
of
the
master
it
was
in
short
no
ordinary
return
but
a
triumphal
one
for
the
bailiff
was
bringing
home
a
guest
a
maid
neatly
dressed
in
her
best
clothes
opened
the
door
the
bailiff
gave
her
an
order
in
a
low
voice
and
thibault
whose
adoration
of
beautiful
women
did
not
prevent
him
from
liking
a
good
dinner
gathered
that
these
few
whispered
words
referred
to
the
menu
which
perrine
was
to
prepare
then
turning
round
his
host
addressed
thibault
welcome
my
dear
guest
to
the
house
of
bailiff
népomucène
thibault
politely
allowed
madame
to
pass
in
before
him
and
was
then
introduced
into
the
but
the
now
made
a
slip
unaccustomed
as
yet
to
luxury
the
man
of
the
forest
was
not
adroit
enough
to
hide
the
admiration
which
he
felt
on
beholding
the
bailiff
s
home
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
damask
curtains
and
gilt
armchairs
he
had
not
imagined
that
any
one
save
the
king
or
at
least
his
highness
the
duke
of
orleans
had
curtains
and
armchairs
of
this
magnificence
he
was
unconscious
that
all
the
while
madame
magloire
was
closely
watching
him
and
that
his
simple
astonishment
and
delight
did
not
escape
her
detective
eye
however
she
appeared
now
after
mature
reflexion
to
look
with
greater
favour
on
the
guest
whom
her
husband
had
imposed
upon
her
and
endeavoured
to
soften
for
him
the
glances
of
her
dark
eyes
but
her
affability
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
lead
her
to
comply
with
the
request
of
monsieur
magloire
who
begged
her
to
add
to
the
flavour
and
bouquet
of
the
champagne
by
pouring
it
out
herself
for
her
guest
notwithstanding
the
entreaties
of
her
august
husband
the
bailiff
s
wife
refused
and
under
the
pretext
of
fatigue
from
her
walk
she
retired
to
her
own
room
before
leaving
the
room
however
she
expressed
a
hope
to
thibault
that
as
she
owed
him
some
expiation
he
would
not
forget
the
way
to
erneville
ending
her
speech
with
a
smile
which
displayed
a
row
of
charming
teeth
thibault
responded
with
so
much
lively
pleasure
in
his
voice
that
it
rendered
any
roughness
of
speech
less
noticeable
swearing
that
he
would
sooner
lose
the
power
to
eat
and
drink
than
the
remembrance
of
a
lady
who
was
as
courteous
as
she
was
beautiful
madame
magloire
gave
him
a
curtsey
which
would
have
made
her
known
as
the
bailiff
s
wife
a
mile
off
and
left
the
room
she
had
hardly
closed
the
door
behind
her
when
monsieur
magloire
went
through
a
pirouette
in
her
honour
which
though
less
light
was
not
less
significant
than
the
caper
a
executes
when
once
he
has
got
rid
of
his
master
ah
my
dear
friend
he
said
now
that
we
are
no
longer
hampered
by
a
woman
s
presence
we
will
have
a
good
go
at
the
wine
those
women
they
are
delightful
at
mass
or
at
a
ball
but
at
table
heaven
defend
me
there
is
nobody
like
the
men
what
do
you
say
old
fellow
perrine
now
came
in
to
receive
her
master
s
orders
as
to
what
wine
she
was
to
bring
up
but
the
gay
little
man
was
far
too
fastidious
a
judge
of
wines
to
trust
a
woman
with
such
a
commission
as
this
indeed
women
never
show
that
reverential
respect
for
certain
old
bottles
which
is
their
due
nor
that
delicacy
of
touch
with
which
they
love
to
be
handled
he
drew
perrine
down
as
if
to
whisper
something
in
her
ear
instead
of
which
he
gave
a
good
sound
kiss
to
the
cheek
which
was
still
young
and
fresh
and
which
did
not
blush
sufficiently
to
lead
to
the
belief
that
the
kiss
was
a
novelty
to
it
well
sir
said
the
girl
laughing
what
is
it
this
is
it
perrinette
my
love
said
the
bailiff
that
i
alone
know
the
good
brands
and
as
they
are
many
in
number
you
might
get
lost
among
them
and
so
i
am
going
to
the
cellar
and
the
good
man
disappeared
trundling
off
on
his
little
legs
cheerful
alert
and
fantastic
as
those
nuremberg
toys
mounted
on
a
stand
which
you
wind
up
with
a
key
and
which
once
set
going
turn
round
and
round
or
go
first
one
way
and
then
the
other
till
the
spring
has
run
down
the
only
difference
being
that
this
dear
little
man
seemed
wound
up
by
the
hand
of
god
himself
and
gave
no
sign
of
ever
coming
to
a
standstill
thibault
was
left
alone
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
congratulating
himself
on
having
chanced
upon
such
a
house
with
such
a
beautiful
wife
and
such
an
amiable
husband
for
host
and
hostess
five
minutes
later
the
door
again
opened
and
in
came
the
bailiff
with
a
bottle
in
either
hand
and
one
under
each
arm
the
two
under
his
arms
were
bottles
of
sparkling
sillery
of
the
first
quality
which
not
being
injured
by
shaking
were
safe
to
be
carried
in
a
horizontal
position
the
two
which
he
carried
in
his
hands
and
which
he
held
with
a
respectful
care
which
was
a
pleasure
to
behold
were
one
a
bottle
of
very
old
chambertin
the
other
a
bottle
of
hermitage
the
supper
hour
had
now
come
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
the
period
of
which
we
are
writing
dinner
was
at
and
supper
at
six
moreover
it
had
already
been
dark
for
some
time
before
six
o
clock
in
this
month
of
january
and
whether
it
be
six
or
twelve
o
clock
at
night
if
one
has
to
eat
one
s
meal
by
candle
or
it
always
seems
to
one
like
supper
the
bailiff
put
the
bottles
tenderly
down
on
the
table
and
rang
the
bell
perrinette
came
in
when
will
the
table
be
ready
for
us
my
pretty
asked
magloire
whenever
monsieur
pleases
replied
perrine
i
know
monsieur
does
not
like
waiting
so
i
always
have
everything
ready
in
good
go
and
ask
madame
then
if
she
is
not
coming
tell
her
perrine
that
we
do
not
wish
to
sit
down
without
perrine
left
the
room
we
may
as
well
go
into
the
to
wait
said
the
little
host
you
must
be
hungry
my
dear
friend
and
when
i
am
hungry
i
like
to
feed
my
eyes
before
i
feed
my
you
seem
to
me
to
be
a
fine
gourmand
you
said
thibault
epicure
epicure
not
gourmand
you
must
not
confuse
the
two
things
i
go
first
but
only
in
order
to
show
you
the
and
so
saying
monsieur
magloire
led
his
guest
into
the
ah
he
exclaimed
gaily
as
he
went
in
patting
his
corporation
tell
me
now
do
you
not
think
this
girl
of
mine
is
a
capital
cook
fit
to
serve
a
cardinal
just
look
now
at
this
little
supper
she
has
spread
for
us
quite
a
simple
one
and
yet
it
pleases
me
more
i
am
sure
than
would
have
belshazzar
s
on
my
honour
bailiff
said
thibault
you
are
right
it
is
a
sight
to
rejoice
one
s
and
thibault
s
eyes
began
to
shine
like
carbuncles
and
yet
it
was
as
the
bailiff
described
it
quite
an
unpretentious
little
supper
but
withal
so
appetising
to
look
upon
that
it
was
quite
surprising
at
one
end
of
the
table
was
a
fine
carp
boiled
in
vinegar
and
herbs
with
the
roe
served
on
either
side
of
it
on
a
layer
of
parsley
dotted
about
with
cut
carrots
the
opposite
end
was
occupied
by
a
and
deliciously
reposing
on
a
dish
of
spinach
which
lay
like
a
green
islet
surrounded
by
an
ocean
of
gravy
a
delicate
made
of
two
partridges
only
of
which
the
heads
appeared
above
the
upper
crust
as
if
ready
to
attack
one
another
with
their
beaks
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
while
the
intervening
spaces
were
covered
with
holding
slices
of
arles
sausage
pieces
of
swimming
in
beautiful
green
oil
from
provence
anchovies
sliced
and
arranged
in
all
kinds
of
strange
and
fantastic
patterns
on
a
white
and
yellow
bed
of
chopped
eggs
and
pats
of
butter
that
could
only
have
been
churned
that
very
day
as
accessories
to
these
were
two
or
three
sorts
of
cheese
chosen
from
among
those
of
which
the
chief
quality
is
to
provoke
thirst
some
reims
biscuits
of
delightful
crispness
and
pears
just
fit
to
eat
showing
that
the
master
himself
had
taken
the
trouble
to
preserve
them
and
to
turn
them
about
on
the
shelf
thibault
was
so
taken
up
in
the
contemplation
of
this
little
amateur
supper
that
he
scarcely
heard
the
message
which
perrine
brought
back
from
her
mistress
who
sent
word
that
she
had
a
and
begged
to
make
her
excuses
to
her
guest
with
the
hope
that
she
might
have
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
him
when
he
next
came
the
little
man
gave
visible
signs
of
rejoicing
on
hearing
his
wife
s
answer
breathed
loudly
and
clapped
his
hands
exclaiming
she
has
a
headache
she
has
a
headache
come
along
then
sit
down
sit
down
and
thereupon
besides
the
two
bottles
of
old
mâcon
which
had
already
been
respectively
placed
within
reach
of
the
host
and
guest
as
vin
ordinaire
between
the
and
the
dessert
plates
he
introduced
the
four
other
bottles
which
he
had
just
brought
up
from
the
cellar
madame
magloire
had
i
think
acted
not
unwisely
in
refusing
to
sup
with
these
stalwart
champions
of
the
table
for
such
was
their
hunger
and
thirst
that
half
the
carp
and
the
two
bottles
of
wine
disappeared
without
a
word
passing
between
them
except
such
exclamations
as
good
fish
isn
t
it
capital
fine
wine
isn
t
it
excellent
the
carp
and
the
mâcon
being
consumed
they
passed
on
to
the
game
pie
and
the
chambertin
and
now
their
tongues
began
to
be
unloosed
especially
the
bailiff
s
by
the
time
half
the
game
pie
and
the
first
bottle
of
chambertin
were
finished
thibault
knew
the
history
of
népomucène
magloire
not
a
very
complicated
one
it
must
be
confessed
monsieur
magloire
was
son
to
a
church
ornament
manufacturer
who
had
worked
for
the
chapel
belonging
to
his
highness
the
duke
of
orleans
the
latter
in
his
religious
zeal
having
a
burning
desire
to
obtain
pictures
by
albano
and
titian
for
the
sum
of
four
to
five
thousand
francs
chrysostom
magloire
had
placed
his
son
népomucène
magloire
as
with
louis
son
his
highness
the
duke
of
orleans
the
young
man
had
from
infancy
almost
manifested
a
decided
taste
for
cooking
he
had
been
especially
attached
to
the
castle
at
and
for
thirty
years
presided
over
his
highness
s
dinners
the
latter
introducing
him
to
his
friends
as
a
thorough
artist
and
from
time
to
time
sending
for
him
to
come
upstairs
to
talk
over
culinary
matters
with
marshal
richelieu
when
years
of
age
magloire
found
himself
so
rounded
in
bulk
that
it
was
only
with
some
difficulty
he
could
get
through
the
narrow
doors
of
the
passages
and
offices
fearing
to
be
caught
some
day
like
the
weasel
of
the
fable
he
asked
permission
to
resign
his
post
the
duke
consented
not
without
regret
but
with
less
regret
than
he
would
have
felt
at
any
other
time
for
he
had
just
married
madame
de
montesson
and
it
was
only
rarely
now
that
he
visited
his
castle
at
his
highness
had
fine
ideas
as
regards
superannuated
retainers
he
therefore
sent
for
magloire
and
asked
him
how
much
he
had
been
able
to
save
while
in
his
service
magloire
replied
that
he
was
happily
able
to
retire
with
a
competence
the
prince
however
insisted
upon
knowing
the
exact
amount
of
his
little
fortune
and
magloire
confessed
to
an
income
of
nine
thousand
livres
a
man
who
has
provided
me
with
such
a
good
table
for
thirty
years
said
the
prince
should
have
enough
to
live
well
upon
himself
for
the
remainder
of
his
and
he
made
up
the
income
to
twelve
thousand
so
that
magloire
might
have
a
thousand
livres
a
month
to
spend
added
to
this
he
allowed
him
to
choose
furniture
for
the
whole
of
his
house
from
his
own
old
and
thence
came
the
damask
curtains
and
gilt
arm
chairs
which
although
just
a
little
bit
faded
and
worn
had
nevertheless
preserved
that
appearance
of
grandeur
which
had
made
such
an
impression
on
thibault
by
the
time
the
whole
of
the
first
partridge
was
finished
and
half
the
second
bottle
had
been
drunk
thibault
knew
that
madame
magloire
was
the
host
s
fourth
wife
a
fact
which
seemed
in
his
own
eyes
to
add
a
good
foot
or
two
to
his
height
he
had
also
ascertained
that
he
had
married
her
not
for
her
fortune
but
for
her
beauty
having
always
had
as
great
a
predilection
for
pretty
faces
and
beautiful
statues
as
for
good
wines
and
appetising
victuals
and
monsieur
magloire
further
stated
with
no
sign
of
faltering
that
old
as
he
was
if
his
wife
were
to
die
he
should
have
no
fear
in
entering
on
a
fifth
marriage
as
he
now
passed
from
the
chambertin
to
the
hermitage
which
he
alternated
with
the
sillery
monsieur
magloire
began
to
speak
of
his
wife
s
qualities
she
was
not
the
personification
of
docility
no
quite
the
reverse
she
was
somewhat
opposed
to
her
husband
s
admiration
for
the
various
wines
of
france
and
did
everything
she
could
even
using
physical
force
to
prevent
his
too
frequent
visits
to
the
cellar
while
for
one
who
believed
in
living
without
ceremony
she
on
her
part
was
too
fond
of
dress
too
much
given
to
elaborate
english
laces
and
such
like
gewgaws
which
women
make
part
of
their
arsenal
she
would
gladly
have
turned
the
twelve
hogsheads
of
wine
which
formed
the
staple
of
her
husband
s
cellar
into
lace
for
her
arms
and
ribands
for
her
throat
if
monsieur
magloire
had
been
the
man
to
allow
this
metamorphosis
but
with
this
exception
there
was
not
a
virtue
which
suzanne
did
not
possess
and
these
virtues
of
hers
if
the
bailiff
was
to
be
believed
were
carried
on
so
perfectly
shaped
a
pair
of
legs
that
if
by
any
misfortune
she
were
to
lose
one
it
would
be
quite
impossible
throughout
the
district
to
find
another
that
would
match
the
leg
that
remained
the
good
man
was
like
a
regular
whale
blowing
out
from
all
his
as
the
former
does
but
even
before
all
these
hidden
perfections
of
his
wife
had
been
revealed
to
him
by
the
bailiff
like
a
modern
king
candaules
ready
to
confide
in
a
modern
gyges
her
beauty
had
already
made
such
a
deep
impression
on
the
that
as
we
have
seen
he
could
do
nothing
but
think
of
it
in
silence
as
he
walked
beside
her
and
since
he
had
been
at
table
he
had
continued
to
dream
about
it
listening
to
his
host
eating
the
while
of
course
without
answering
as
monsieur
magloire
delighted
to
have
such
an
accommodating
audience
poured
forth
his
tales
linked
one
to
another
like
a
necklace
of
beads
but
the
worthy
bailiff
having
made
a
second
excursion
to
the
cellar
and
this
second
excursion
having
produced
as
the
saying
is
a
little
knot
at
the
tip
of
his
tongue
he
began
to
be
rather
less
appreciative
of
the
rare
quality
which
was
required
in
his
disciples
by
pythagons
he
therefore
gave
thibault
to
understand
that
he
had
now
said
all
that
he
wished
to
tell
him
concerning
himself
and
his
wife
and
that
it
was
thibault
s
turn
to
give
him
some
information
as
regards
his
own
circumstances
the
amiable
little
man
adding
that
wishing
often
to
visit
him
he
wished
to
know
more
about
him
thibault
felt
that
it
was
very
necessary
to
disguise
the
truth
and
accordingly
gave
himself
out
as
a
man
living
at
ease
in
the
country
on
the
revenues
of
two
farms
and
of
a
hundred
acres
of
land
situated
near
vertefeuille
there
was
he
continued
a
splendid
warren
on
these
hundred
acres
with
a
wonderful
supply
of
red
and
fallow
deer
boars
partridges
pheasants
and
hares
of
which
the
bailiff
should
have
some
to
taste
the
bailiff
was
astonished
and
delighted
as
we
have
seen
by
the
menu
for
his
table
he
was
fond
of
venison
and
he
was
carried
away
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
obtaining
his
game
without
having
recourse
to
the
poachers
and
through
the
channel
of
this
new
friendship
and
now
the
last
drop
of
the
seventh
bottle
having
been
scrupulously
divided
between
the
two
glasses
they
decided
that
it
was
time
to
stop
the
rosy
champagne
prime
vintage
of
aï
and
the
last
bottle
emptied
had
brought
népomucène
magloire
s
habitual
good
nature
to
the
level
of
tender
affection
he
was
charmed
with
his
new
friend
who
tossed
off
his
bottle
in
almost
as
good
style
as
he
did
himself
he
addressed
him
as
his
bosom
friend
he
embraced
him
he
made
him
promise
that
there
should
be
a
morrow
to
their
pleasant
entertainment
he
stood
a
second
time
on
tiptoe
to
give
him
a
parting
hug
as
he
accompanied
him
to
the
door
which
thibault
on
his
part
bending
down
received
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
the
church
clock
of
erneville
was
striking
midnight
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
the
fumes
of
the
heady
wine
he
had
been
drinking
had
begun
to
give
him
a
feeling
of
oppression
before
leaving
the
house
but
it
was
worse
when
he
got
into
the
open
air
he
staggered
overcome
with
giddiness
and
went
and
leant
with
his
back
against
a
wall
what
followed
next
was
as
vague
and
mysterious
to
him
as
the
phantasmagoria
of
a
dream
above
his
head
about
six
or
eight
feet
from
the
ground
was
a
window
which
as
he
moved
to
lean
against
the
wall
had
appeared
to
him
to
be
lighted
although
the
light
was
shaded
by
double
curtains
he
had
hardly
taken
up
his
position
against
the
wall
when
he
thought
he
heard
it
open
it
was
he
imagined
the
worthy
bailiff
unwilling
to
part
with
him
without
sending
him
a
last
farewell
and
he
tried
to
step
forward
so
as
to
do
honour
to
this
gracious
intention
but
his
attempt
was
unavailing
at
first
he
thought
he
was
stuck
to
the
wall
like
a
branch
of
ivy
but
he
was
soon
disabused
of
this
idea
he
felt
a
heavy
weight
planted
first
on
the
right
shoulder
and
then
on
the
left
which
made
his
knees
give
way
so
that
he
slid
down
the
wall
as
if
to
seat
himself
this
manœuvre
on
thibault
s
part
appeared
to
be
just
what
the
individual
who
was
making
use
of
him
as
a
ladder
wished
him
to
do
for
we
can
no
longer
hide
the
fact
that
the
weight
so
felt
was
that
of
a
man
as
thibault
made
his
forced
genuflexion
the
man
was
also
lowered
that
s
right
l
eveillé
that
s
right
he
said
so
and
with
this
last
word
he
jumped
to
the
ground
while
overhead
was
heard
the
sound
of
a
window
being
shut
thibault
had
sense
enough
to
understand
two
things
first
that
he
was
mistaken
for
someone
called
l
eveillé
who
was
probably
asleep
somewhere
about
the
premises
secondly
that
his
shoulders
had
just
served
some
lover
as
a
climbing
ladder
both
of
which
things
caused
thibault
an
undefined
sense
of
humiliation
accordingly
he
seized
hold
mechanically
of
some
floating
piece
of
stuff
which
he
took
to
be
the
lover
s
cloak
and
with
the
persistency
of
a
drunken
man
continued
to
hang
on
to
it
what
are
you
doing
that
for
you
scoundrel
asked
a
voice
which
did
not
seem
altogether
unfamiliar
to
the
one
would
think
you
were
afraid
of
losing
most
certainly
i
am
afraid
of
losing
you
replied
thibault
because
i
wish
to
know
who
it
is
has
the
impertinence
to
use
my
shoulders
for
a
phew
said
the
unknown
it
s
not
you
then
l
eveillé
no
it
is
not
replied
thibault
well
whether
it
is
you
or
not
you
i
thank
how
thank
you
ah
i
dare
say
thank
you
indeed
you
think
the
matter
is
going
to
rest
like
that
do
you
i
had
counted
upon
it
being
so
then
you
counted
without
your
now
you
blackguard
leave
go
of
me
you
are
drunk
drunk
what
do
you
mean
we
only
drank
seven
bottles
between
us
and
the
bailiff
had
a
good
four
to
his
leave
go
of
me
you
drunkard
do
you
hear
drunkard
you
call
me
a
drunkard
a
drunkard
for
having
drunk
three
bottles
of
wine
i
don
t
call
you
a
drunkard
because
you
drank
three
bottles
of
wine
but
because
you
let
yourself
get
tipsy
over
those
three
unfortunate
and
with
a
gesture
of
commiseration
and
trying
for
the
third
time
to
release
his
cloak
the
unknown
continued
now
then
are
you
going
to
let
go
my
cloak
or
not
you
idiot
thibault
was
at
all
times
touchy
as
to
the
way
people
addressed
him
but
in
his
present
state
of
mind
his
susceptibility
amounted
to
extreme
irritation
by
the
devil
he
exclaimed
let
me
tell
you
my
fine
sir
that
the
only
idiot
here
is
the
man
who
gives
insults
in
return
for
the
services
of
which
he
has
made
use
and
seeing
that
is
so
i
do
not
know
what
prevents
me
planting
my
fist
in
the
middle
of
your
this
menace
was
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
as
instantly
as
a
cannon
goes
off
once
the
flame
of
the
match
has
touched
the
powder
the
blow
with
which
thibault
had
threatened
his
unknown
adversary
came
full
against
his
own
cheek
take
that
you
beast
said
the
voice
which
brought
back
to
thibault
certain
recollections
in
connection
with
the
blow
he
received
i
am
a
good
jew
you
see
and
pay
you
back
your
money
before
weighing
your
thibault
s
answer
was
a
blow
in
the
chest
it
was
well
directed
and
thibault
felt
inwardly
pleased
with
it
himself
but
it
had
no
more
effect
on
his
antagonist
than
the
fillip
from
a
child
s
finger
would
have
on
an
oak
tree
it
was
returned
by
a
second
blow
of
the
fist
which
so
far
exceeded
the
former
in
the
force
with
which
it
was
delivered
that
thibault
felt
certain
if
the
giant
s
strength
went
on
increasing
in
the
same
ratio
that
a
third
of
the
kind
would
level
him
with
the
ground
but
the
very
violence
of
his
blow
brought
disaster
on
thibault
s
unknown
assailant
the
latter
had
fallen
on
to
one
knee
and
so
doing
his
hand
touching
the
ground
came
in
contact
with
a
stone
rising
in
fury
to
his
feet
again
with
the
stone
in
his
hand
he
flung
it
at
his
enemy
s
head
the
colossal
figure
uttered
a
sound
like
the
bellowing
of
an
ox
turned
round
on
himself
and
then
like
an
oak
tree
cut
off
by
the
roots
fell
his
whole
length
on
the
ground
and
lay
there
insensible
not
knowing
whether
he
had
killed
or
only
wounded
his
adversary
thibault
took
to
his
heels
and
fled
not
even
turning
to
look
behind
him
chapter
xii
wolves
in
the
sheep
fold
the
forest
was
not
far
from
the
bailiff
s
house
and
in
two
bounds
thibault
found
himself
on
the
further
side
of
and
in
the
wooded
path
leading
to
the
brickyard
he
had
no
sooner
entered
the
forest
than
his
usual
escort
surrounded
him
fawning
and
blinking
with
their
eyes
and
wagging
their
tails
to
show
their
pleasure
thibault
who
had
been
so
alarmed
the
first
time
he
found
himself
in
company
with
this
strange
body
guard
took
no
more
notice
of
them
now
than
if
they
had
been
a
pack
of
poodles
he
gave
them
a
word
or
two
of
caress
softly
scratched
the
head
of
the
one
that
was
nearest
him
and
continued
on
his
way
thinking
over
his
double
triumph
he
had
beaten
his
host
at
the
bottle
he
had
vanquished
his
adversary
at
fisticuffs
and
in
this
joyous
frame
of
mind
he
walked
along
saying
aloud
to
himself
you
must
acknowledge
friend
thibault
that
you
are
a
lucky
rascal
madame
suzanne
is
in
every
possible
respect
just
what
you
want
a
bailiff
s
wife
my
word
that
s
a
conquest
worth
making
and
if
he
dies
first
what
a
wife
to
get
but
in
either
case
when
she
is
walking
beside
me
and
taking
my
arm
whether
as
wife
or
mistress
the
devil
take
it
if
i
am
mistaken
for
anything
but
a
gentleman
and
to
think
that
unless
i
am
fool
enough
to
play
my
cards
badly
all
this
will
be
mine
for
she
did
not
deceive
me
by
the
way
she
went
off
those
who
have
nothing
to
fear
have
no
need
to
take
flight
she
was
afraid
to
show
her
feelings
too
plainly
at
first
meeting
but
how
kind
she
was
after
she
got
home
well
well
it
is
all
working
itself
out
as
i
can
see
i
have
only
got
to
push
matters
a
bit
and
some
fine
morning
she
will
find
herself
rid
of
her
fat
little
old
man
and
then
the
thing
is
done
not
that
i
do
or
can
wish
for
the
death
of
poor
monsieur
magloire
if
i
take
his
place
after
he
is
no
more
well
and
good
but
to
kill
a
man
who
has
given
you
such
good
wine
to
drink
to
kill
him
with
his
good
wine
still
hot
in
your
mouth
why
even
my
friend
the
wolf
would
blush
for
me
if
i
were
guilty
of
such
a
then
with
one
of
his
most
roguish
smiles
he
went
on
and
besides
would
it
not
be
as
well
to
have
already
acquired
some
rights
over
madame
suzanne
by
the
time
monsieur
magloire
passes
in
the
course
of
nature
into
the
other
world
which
considering
the
way
in
which
the
old
scamp
eats
and
drinks
can
not
be
a
matter
of
long
delay
and
then
no
doubt
because
the
good
qualities
of
the
bailiff
s
wife
which
had
been
so
highly
extolled
to
him
came
back
to
his
mind
no
no
he
continued
no
illness
no
death
but
just
those
ordinary
disagreeables
which
happen
to
everybody
only
as
it
is
to
be
to
my
advantage
i
should
like
rather
more
than
the
usual
share
to
fall
to
him
one
can
not
at
his
age
set
up
for
a
smart
young
buck
no
every
one
according
to
their
dues
and
when
these
things
come
to
pass
i
will
give
you
more
than
a
thank
you
cousin
my
readers
will
doubtless
not
be
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
as
thibault
who
saw
nothing
offensive
in
this
pleasantry
of
his
but
on
the
contrary
rubbed
his
hands
together
smiling
at
his
own
thoughts
and
indeed
so
pleased
with
them
that
he
had
reached
the
town
and
found
himself
at
the
end
of
the
rue
de
largny
before
he
was
aware
that
he
had
left
the
bailiff
s
house
more
than
a
few
hundred
paces
behind
him
he
now
made
a
sign
to
his
wolves
for
it
was
not
quite
prudent
to
traverse
the
whole
town
of
with
a
dozen
wolves
walking
alongside
as
a
guard
of
honour
not
only
might
they
meet
dogs
by
the
way
but
the
dogs
might
wake
up
the
inhabitants
six
of
his
wolves
therefore
went
off
to
the
right
and
six
to
the
left
and
although
the
paths
they
took
were
not
exactly
of
the
same
length
and
although
some
of
them
went
more
quickly
than
the
others
the
whole
dozen
nevertheless
managed
to
meet
without
one
missing
at
the
end
of
the
rue
de
lormet
as
soon
as
thibault
had
reached
the
door
of
his
hut
they
took
leave
of
him
and
disappeared
but
before
they
dispersed
thibault
requested
them
to
be
at
the
same
spot
on
the
morrow
as
soon
as
night
fell
although
it
was
two
o
clock
before
thibault
got
home
he
was
up
with
the
dawn
it
is
true
however
that
the
day
does
not
rise
very
early
in
the
month
of
january
he
was
hatching
a
plot
he
had
not
forgotten
the
promise
he
had
made
to
the
bailiff
to
send
him
some
game
from
his
warren
his
warren
being
in
fact
the
whole
of
the
which
belonged
to
his
most
serene
highness
the
duke
of
orleans
this
was
why
he
had
got
up
in
such
good
time
it
had
snowed
for
two
hours
before
and
he
now
went
and
explored
the
forest
in
all
directions
with
the
skill
and
cunning
of
a
bloodhound
he
tracked
the
deer
to
its
lair
the
wild
boar
to
its
soil
the
hare
to
its
form
and
followed
their
traces
to
discover
where
they
went
at
night
and
then
when
darkness
again
fell
on
the
forest
he
gave
a
howl
a
regular
wolf
s
howl
in
answer
to
which
came
crowding
to
him
the
wolves
that
he
had
invited
the
night
before
followed
by
old
and
young
recruits
even
to
the
very
cubs
of
a
year
old
thibault
then
explained
that
he
expected
a
more
than
usually
fine
night
s
hunting
from
his
friends
and
as
an
encouragement
to
them
announced
his
intention
of
going
with
them
himself
and
giving
his
help
in
the
chase
it
was
in
very
truth
a
hunt
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
describe
the
whole
night
through
did
the
sombre
glades
of
the
forest
resound
with
hideous
cries
here
a
roebuck
pursued
by
a
wolf
fell
caught
by
the
throat
by
another
wolf
hidden
in
ambush
there
thibault
knife
in
hand
like
a
butcher
was
running
to
the
assistance
of
three
or
four
of
his
ferocious
companions
that
had
already
fastened
on
a
fine
young
boar
of
four
years
old
which
he
now
finished
off
an
old
came
along
bringing
with
her
hares
which
she
had
surprised
in
their
love
frolics
and
she
had
great
difficulty
in
preventing
her
cubs
from
swallowing
a
whole
covey
of
young
partridges
which
the
young
marauders
had
come
across
with
their
heads
under
their
wings
without
first
waiting
for
the
to
levy
his
dues
madame
suzanne
magloire
little
thought
what
was
taking
place
at
this
moment
in
the
forest
of
and
on
her
account
in
a
couple
of
hours
time
the
wolves
had
heaped
up
a
perfect
of
game
in
front
of
thibault
s
hut
thibault
selected
what
he
wanted
for
his
own
purposes
and
left
over
sufficient
to
provide
them
a
sumptuous
repast
borrowing
a
mule
from
a
on
the
pretext
that
he
wanted
to
convey
his
shoes
to
town
he
loaded
it
up
with
the
game
and
started
for
there
he
sold
a
part
of
this
booty
to
the
gamedealer
reserving
the
best
pieces
and
those
which
had
been
least
mutilated
by
the
wolves
claws
to
present
to
madame
magloire
his
first
intention
had
been
to
go
in
person
with
his
gift
to
the
bailiff
but
thibault
was
beginning
to
have
a
smattering
of
the
ways
of
the
world
and
thought
it
would
therefore
be
more
becoming
to
allow
his
offering
of
game
to
precede
him
to
this
end
he
employed
a
peasant
on
payment
of
a
few
coppers
to
carry
the
game
to
the
bailiff
of
erneville
merely
accompanying
it
with
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
wrote
from
monsieur
he
himself
was
to
follow
closely
on
the
message
and
indeed
so
closely
did
he
do
so
that
he
arrived
just
as
maître
magloire
was
having
the
game
he
had
received
spread
out
on
a
table
the
bailiff
in
the
warmth
of
his
gratitude
extended
his
arms
towards
his
friend
of
the
previous
night
and
tried
to
embrace
him
uttering
loud
cries
of
joy
i
say
for
two
things
prevented
him
from
carrying
out
his
wish
one
the
shortness
of
his
arms
the
other
the
rotundity
of
his
person
but
thinking
that
where
his
capacities
were
insufficient
madame
magloire
might
be
of
assistance
he
ran
to
the
door
calling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
suzanne
suzanne
there
was
so
unusual
a
tone
in
the
bailiff
s
voice
that
his
wife
felt
sure
something
extraordinary
had
happened
but
whether
for
good
or
ill
she
was
unable
to
make
sure
and
downstairs
she
came
therefore
in
great
haste
to
see
for
herself
what
was
taking
place
she
found
her
husband
wild
with
delight
trotting
round
to
look
on
all
sides
at
the
game
spread
on
the
table
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
no
sight
could
have
more
greatly
rejoiced
a
gourmand
s
eye
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
suzanne
look
look
madame
he
cried
clapping
his
hands
together
see
what
our
friend
thibault
has
brought
us
and
thank
him
for
it
praise
be
to
god
there
is
one
person
who
knows
how
to
keep
his
promises
he
tells
us
he
will
send
a
hamper
of
game
and
he
sends
us
a
shake
hands
with
him
embrace
him
at
once
and
just
look
here
at
madame
magloire
graciously
followed
out
her
husband
s
orders
she
gave
thibault
her
hand
allowed
him
to
kiss
her
and
cast
her
beautiful
eyes
over
the
supply
of
food
which
elicited
such
exclamations
of
admiration
from
the
bailiff
and
as
a
supply
which
was
to
make
such
an
acceptable
addition
to
the
ordinary
daily
fare
it
was
certainly
worthy
of
all
admiration
first
as
prime
pieces
came
a
boar
s
head
and
ham
firm
and
savoury
morsels
then
a
fine
three
year
old
kid
which
should
have
been
as
tender
as
the
dew
that
only
the
evening
before
beaded
the
grass
at
which
it
was
nibbling
next
came
hares
fine
fleshy
hares
from
the
heath
of
gondreville
full
fed
on
wild
thyme
and
then
such
scented
pheasants
and
such
delicious
partridges
that
once
on
the
spit
the
magnificence
of
their
plumage
was
forgotten
in
the
perfume
of
their
flesh
and
all
these
good
things
the
fat
little
man
enjoyed
in
advance
in
his
imagination
he
already
saw
the
boar
broiled
on
the
coals
the
kid
dressed
with
the
hares
made
into
a
pasty
the
pheasants
stuffed
with
truffles
the
partridges
dressed
with
cabbage
and
he
put
so
much
fervour
and
feeling
into
his
orders
and
directions
that
merely
to
hear
him
was
enough
to
set
a
gourmand
s
mouth
watering
it
was
this
enthusiasm
on
the
part
of
the
bailiff
which
no
doubt
made
madame
suzanne
appear
somewhat
cold
and
unappreciative
in
comparison
nevertheless
she
took
the
initiative
and
with
much
graciousness
assured
thibault
that
she
would
on
no
account
allow
him
to
return
to
his
farms
until
all
the
provisions
with
which
thanks
to
him
the
larder
would
now
overflow
had
been
consumed
you
may
guess
how
delighted
thibault
was
at
having
his
cherished
wishes
thus
met
by
madame
herself
he
promised
himself
no
end
of
grand
things
from
this
stay
at
erneville
and
his
spirits
rose
to
the
point
of
himself
proposing
to
maître
magloire
that
they
should
indulge
in
a
preparatory
whack
of
liquor
to
prepare
their
digestions
for
the
savoury
dishes
that
mademoiselle
perrine
was
preparing
for
them
maître
magloire
was
quite
gratified
to
see
that
thibault
had
forgotten
nothing
not
even
the
cook
s
name
he
sent
for
some
vermouth
a
liqueur
as
yet
but
little
known
in
france
having
been
imported
from
holland
by
the
duke
of
orleans
and
of
which
a
present
had
been
made
by
his
highness
s
head
cook
to
his
predecessor
thibault
made
a
face
over
it
he
did
not
think
this
foreign
drink
was
equal
to
a
nice
little
glass
of
native
châblis
but
when
assured
by
the
bailiff
that
thanks
to
the
beverage
he
would
in
an
hour
s
time
have
a
ferocious
appetite
he
made
no
further
remark
and
affably
assisted
his
host
to
finish
the
bottle
madame
suzanne
meanwhile
had
returned
to
her
own
room
to
smarten
herself
up
a
bit
as
women
say
which
generally
means
an
entire
change
of
raiment
it
was
not
long
before
the
sounded
and
madame
suzanne
came
down
stairs
again
she
was
perfectly
dazzling
in
a
splendid
dress
of
grey
damask
trimmed
with
pearl
and
the
transports
of
amorous
admiration
into
which
thibault
was
thrown
by
the
sight
of
her
prevented
the
from
thinking
of
the
awkwardness
of
the
position
in
which
he
now
unavoidably
found
himself
dining
as
he
was
for
the
first
time
with
such
handsome
and
distinguished
company
to
his
credit
be
it
said
he
did
not
make
bad
use
of
his
opportunities
not
only
did
he
cast
frequent
and
unmistakable
sheep
s
eyes
at
his
fair
hostess
but
he
gradually
brought
his
knee
nearer
to
hers
and
finally
went
so
far
as
to
give
it
a
gentle
pressure
suddenly
and
while
thibault
was
engaged
in
this
performance
madame
suzanne
who
was
looking
sweetly
towards
him
opened
her
eyes
and
stared
fixedly
a
moment
then
she
opened
her
mouth
and
went
off
into
such
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
that
she
almost
choked
and
nearly
went
into
hysterics
maître
magloire
taking
no
notice
of
the
effect
turned
straight
to
the
cause
and
he
now
looked
at
thibault
and
was
much
more
concerned
and
alarmed
with
what
he
thought
to
see
than
with
the
nervous
state
of
excitement
into
which
his
wife
had
been
thrown
by
her
hilarity
ah
my
dear
fellow
he
cried
stretching
two
little
agitated
arms
towards
thibault
you
are
in
flames
you
are
in
flames
thibault
sprang
up
hastily
where
how
he
asked
your
hair
is
on
fire
answered
the
bailiff
in
all
sincerity
and
so
genuine
was
his
terror
that
he
seized
the
water
bottle
that
was
in
front
of
his
wife
in
order
to
put
out
the
conflagration
blazing
among
thibault
s
locks
the
involuntarily
put
up
his
hand
to
his
head
but
feeling
no
heat
he
at
once
guessed
what
was
the
matter
and
fell
back
into
his
chair
turning
horribly
pale
he
had
been
so
preoccupied
during
the
last
two
days
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
to
take
the
same
precaution
he
had
done
before
visiting
the
owner
of
the
mill
and
had
omitted
to
give
his
hair
that
particular
twist
whereby
he
was
able
to
hide
the
hairs
of
which
the
black
wolf
had
acquired
the
proprietorship
under
his
others
added
to
this
he
had
during
this
short
period
given
vent
to
so
many
little
wishes
one
here
and
one
there
all
more
or
less
to
the
detriment
of
his
neighbour
that
the
hairs
had
multiplied
to
an
alarming
extent
and
at
this
moment
any
one
of
them
could
vie
in
brilliancy
with
the
light
from
the
two
wax
candles
which
lit
the
room
well
you
did
give
me
a
dreadful
fright
monsieur
magloire
said
thibault
trying
to
conceal
his
agitation
but
but
responded
the
bailiff
still
pointing
with
a
certain
remains
of
fear
at
thibault
s
flaming
lock
of
hair
that
is
nothing
continued
thibault
do
not
be
uneasy
about
the
unusual
colour
of
some
of
my
hair
it
came
from
a
fright
my
mother
had
with
a
pan
of
hot
coals
that
nearly
set
her
hair
on
fire
before
i
was
but
what
is
more
strange
still
said
madame
suzanne
who
had
swallowed
a
whole
glassful
of
water
in
the
effort
to
control
her
laughter
that
i
have
remarked
this
dazzling
peculiarity
for
the
first
time
ah
really
said
thibault
scarcely
knowing
what
to
say
in
answer
the
other
day
continued
madame
suzanne
it
seemed
to
me
that
your
hair
was
as
black
as
my
velvet
mantle
and
yet
believe
me
i
did
not
fail
to
study
you
most
attentively
monsieur
this
last
sentence
reviving
thibault
s
hopes
restored
him
once
more
to
good
humour
ah
madame
he
replied
you
know
the
proverb
red
hair
warm
heart
and
the
other
some
folks
are
like
sabots
smooth
outside
but
rough
to
wear
madame
magloire
made
a
face
at
this
low
proverb
about
wooden
shoes
but
as
was
often
the
case
with
the
bailiff
he
did
not
agree
with
his
wife
on
this
point
my
friend
thibault
utters
words
of
gold
he
said
and
i
need
not
go
far
to
be
able
to
point
the
truth
of
his
proverbs
see
for
example
this
soup
we
have
here
which
has
nothing
much
in
its
appearance
to
commend
it
but
never
have
i
found
onion
and
bread
fried
in
more
to
my
and
after
this
there
was
no
further
talk
of
thibault
s
fiery
head
nevertheless
it
seemed
as
if
madame
suzanne
s
eyes
were
irresistibly
attracted
to
this
unfortunate
lock
and
every
time
that
thibault
s
eyes
met
the
mocking
look
in
hers
he
thought
he
detected
on
her
face
a
reminiscence
of
the
laugh
which
had
not
long
since
made
him
feel
so
uncomfortable
he
was
very
much
annoyed
at
this
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
kept
putting
up
his
hand
to
try
and
hide
the
unfortunate
lock
under
the
rest
of
his
hair
but
the
hairs
were
not
only
unusual
in
colour
but
also
of
a
phenomenal
stiffness
it
was
no
longer
human
hair
but
in
vain
thibault
endeavoured
to
hide
the
devil
s
hairs
beneath
his
own
nothing
not
even
the
s
tongs
could
have
induced
them
to
lie
otherwise
than
in
the
way
which
seemed
natural
to
them
but
although
so
occupied
with
thinking
of
his
hair
thibault
s
legs
still
continued
their
tender
manœuvres
and
although
madame
magloire
made
no
response
to
their
solicitations
she
apparently
had
no
wish
to
escape
from
them
and
thibault
was
presumptuously
led
to
believe
that
he
had
achieved
a
conquest
they
sat
on
pretty
late
into
the
night
and
madame
suzanne
who
appeared
to
find
the
evening
drag
rose
several
times
from
the
table
and
went
backwards
and
forwards
to
other
parts
of
the
house
which
afforded
the
bailiff
opportunities
of
frequent
visits
to
the
cellar
he
hid
so
many
bottles
in
the
lining
of
his
waistcoat
and
once
on
the
table
he
emptied
them
so
rapidly
that
little
by
little
his
head
sank
lower
and
lower
on
to
his
chest
and
it
was
evidently
high
time
to
put
an
end
to
the
bout
if
he
was
to
be
saved
from
falling
under
the
table
thibault
decided
to
profit
by
this
condition
of
things
and
to
declare
his
love
to
the
bailiff
s
wife
without
delay
judging
it
a
good
opportunity
to
speak
while
the
husband
was
heavy
with
drink
he
therefore
expressed
a
wish
to
retire
for
the
night
whereupon
they
rose
from
table
and
perrine
was
called
and
bidden
to
show
the
guest
to
his
room
as
he
followed
her
along
the
corridor
he
made
enquiries
of
her
concerning
the
different
rooms
number
one
was
maître
magloire
s
number
two
that
of
his
wife
and
number
three
was
his
the
bailiff
s
room
and
his
wife
s
communicated
with
one
another
by
an
inner
door
thibault
s
room
had
access
to
the
corridor
only
he
also
noticed
that
madame
suzanne
was
in
her
husband
s
room
no
doubt
some
pious
sense
of
conjugal
duty
had
taken
her
there
the
good
man
was
in
a
condition
approaching
to
that
of
noah
when
his
sons
took
occasion
to
insult
him
and
madame
suzanne
s
assistance
would
seem
to
have
been
needed
to
get
him
into
his
room
thibault
left
his
own
room
on
tiptoe
carefully
shut
his
door
behind
him
listened
for
a
moment
at
the
door
of
madame
suzanne
s
room
heard
no
sound
within
felt
for
the
key
found
it
in
the
lock
paused
a
second
and
then
turned
it
the
door
opened
the
room
was
in
total
darkness
but
having
for
so
long
consorted
with
wolves
thibault
had
acquired
some
of
their
characteristics
and
among
others
that
of
being
able
to
see
in
the
dark
he
cast
a
rapid
glance
round
the
room
to
the
right
was
the
fireplace
facing
it
a
couch
with
a
large
mirror
above
it
behind
him
on
the
side
of
the
a
large
bed
hung
with
figured
silk
in
front
of
him
near
the
couch
a
covered
with
a
profusion
of
lace
and
last
of
all
two
large
draped
windows
he
hid
himself
behind
the
curtains
of
one
of
these
instinctively
choosing
the
window
that
was
farthest
removed
from
the
husband
s
room
after
waiting
a
quarter
of
an
hour
during
which
time
thibault
s
heart
beat
so
violently
that
the
sound
of
it
fatal
omen
reminded
him
of
the
of
the
at
croyolles
madame
suzanne
entered
the
room
thibault
s
original
plan
had
been
to
leave
his
hiding
place
as
soon
as
madame
suzanne
came
in
and
the
door
was
safely
shut
behind
her
and
there
and
then
to
make
avowal
of
his
love
but
on
consideration
fearing
that
in
her
surprise
and
before
she
recognised
who
it
was
she
might
not
be
able
to
suppress
a
cry
which
would
betray
them
he
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
monsieur
magloire
was
asleep
beyond
all
power
of
being
awakened
perhaps
also
this
procrastination
may
have
been
partly
due
to
that
feeling
which
all
men
have
however
resolute
of
purpose
they
may
be
of
wishing
to
put
off
the
critical
moment
when
on
this
moment
depend
such
chances
as
hung
on
the
one
which
was
to
decide
for
or
against
the
happiness
of
the
for
thibault
by
dint
of
telling
himself
that
he
was
madly
in
love
with
madame
magloire
had
ended
by
believing
that
he
really
was
so
and
in
spite
of
being
under
the
protection
of
the
black
wolf
he
experienced
all
the
timidity
of
the
genuine
lover
so
he
kept
himself
concealed
behind
the
curtains
the
bailiff
s
wife
however
had
taken
up
her
position
before
the
mirror
of
her
pompadour
table
and
was
decking
herself
out
as
if
she
were
going
to
a
festival
or
preparing
to
make
one
of
a
procession
she
tried
on
ten
veils
before
making
choice
of
one
she
arranged
the
folds
of
her
dress
she
fastened
a
triple
row
of
pearls
round
her
neck
then
she
loaded
her
arms
with
all
the
bracelets
she
possessed
finally
she
dressed
her
hair
with
the
minutest
care
thibault
was
lost
in
conjectures
as
to
the
meaning
of
all
this
coquetry
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
dry
grating
noise
as
if
some
hard
body
coming
in
contact
with
a
pane
of
glass
made
him
start
madame
suzanne
started
too
and
immediately
put
out
the
lights
the
then
heard
her
step
softly
to
the
window
and
cautiously
open
it
whereupon
there
followed
some
whisperings
of
which
thibault
could
not
catch
the
words
but
by
drawing
the
curtain
a
little
aside
he
was
able
to
distinguish
in
the
darkness
the
figure
of
a
man
of
gigantic
stature
who
appeared
to
be
climbing
through
the
window
thibault
instantly
recalled
his
adventure
with
the
unknown
combatant
whose
mantle
he
had
clung
to
and
whom
he
had
so
triumphantly
disposed
of
by
hitting
him
on
the
forehead
with
a
stone
as
far
as
he
could
make
out
this
would
be
the
same
window
from
which
the
giant
had
descended
when
he
made
use
of
thibault
s
two
shoulders
as
a
ladder
the
surmise
of
identity
was
undoubtedly
founded
on
a
logical
conclusion
as
a
man
was
now
climbing
in
at
the
window
a
man
could
very
well
have
been
climbing
down
from
it
and
if
a
man
did
climb
down
from
it
unless
of
course
madam
magloire
s
acquaintances
were
many
in
number
and
she
had
a
great
variety
of
tastes
if
a
man
did
climb
down
from
it
in
all
probability
it
was
the
same
man
who
at
this
moment
was
climbing
in
but
whoever
this
nocturnal
visitor
might
be
madame
suzanne
held
out
her
hand
to
the
intruder
who
took
a
heavy
jump
into
the
room
which
made
the
floor
tremble
and
set
all
the
furniture
shaking
the
apparition
was
certainly
not
a
spirit
but
a
corporeal
body
and
moreover
one
that
came
under
the
category
of
heavy
bodies
oh
take
care
my
lord
madame
suzanne
s
voice
was
heard
to
say
heavily
as
my
husband
sleeps
if
you
make
such
a
noise
as
that
you
will
wake
him
by
the
devil
and
his
horns
my
fair
friend
replied
the
stranger
i
can
not
alight
like
a
bird
and
thibault
recognised
the
voice
as
that
of
the
man
with
whom
he
had
had
the
altercation
a
night
or
two
before
although
while
i
was
waiting
under
your
window
for
the
happy
moment
my
heart
was
so
sick
with
longing
that
i
felt
as
if
wings
must
grow
ere
long
to
bear
me
up
into
this
dear
little
and
i
too
my
lord
replied
madame
magloire
with
a
simper
i
too
was
troubled
to
leave
you
outside
to
freeze
in
the
cold
wind
but
the
guest
who
was
with
us
this
evening
only
left
us
half
an
hour
and
what
have
you
been
doing
my
dear
one
during
this
last
half
hour
i
was
obliged
to
help
monsieur
magloire
my
lord
and
to
make
sure
that
he
would
not
come
and
interrupt
you
were
right
as
you
always
are
my
heart
s
my
lord
is
too
kind
replied
suzanne
or
more
correctly
tried
to
reply
for
her
last
words
were
interrupted
as
if
by
some
foreign
body
being
placed
upon
her
lips
which
prevented
her
from
finishing
the
sentence
and
at
the
same
moment
thibault
heard
a
sound
which
was
remarkably
like
that
of
a
kiss
the
wretched
man
was
beginning
to
understand
the
extent
of
the
disappointment
of
which
he
was
again
the
victim
his
reflections
were
interrupted
by
the
voice
of
the
who
coughed
two
or
three
times
suppose
we
shut
the
window
my
love
said
the
voice
after
this
preliminary
coughing
oh
my
lord
forgive
me
said
madame
magloire
it
ought
to
have
been
closed
and
so
saying
she
went
to
the
window
which
she
first
shut
close
and
then
closed
even
more
hermetically
by
drawing
the
curtains
across
it
the
stranger
meanwhile
who
made
himself
thoroughly
at
home
had
drawn
an
easy
chair
up
to
the
fire
and
sat
with
his
legs
stretched
out
warming
his
feet
in
the
most
luxurious
fashion
reflecting
no
doubt
that
for
a
man
half
frozen
the
most
immediate
necessity
is
to
thaw
himself
madame
suzanne
seemed
to
find
no
cause
of
offence
in
this
behaviour
on
the
part
of
her
aristocratic
lover
but
came
up
to
his
chair
and
leant
her
pretty
arms
over
the
back
in
the
most
fascinating
posture
thibault
had
a
good
view
of
the
group
from
behind
well
thrown
up
by
the
light
of
the
fire
and
he
was
overcome
with
inward
rage
the
stranger
appeared
for
a
while
to
have
no
thought
beyond
that
of
warming
himself
but
at
last
the
fire
having
performed
its
appointed
task
he
asked
and
this
stranger
this
guest
of
yours
who
was
he
ah
my
lord
answered
madame
magloire
you
already
know
him
i
think
only
too
what
said
the
favoured
lover
do
you
mean
to
say
it
was
that
drunken
lout
of
the
other
night
again
the
very
same
my
well
all
i
can
say
is
if
ever
i
get
him
into
my
grip
again
my
lord
responded
suzanne
in
a
voice
as
soft
as
music
you
must
not
harbour
evil
designs
against
your
enemies
on
the
contrary
you
must
forgive
them
as
we
are
taught
to
do
by
our
holy
there
is
also
another
religion
which
teaches
that
my
dearest
love
one
of
which
you
are
the
goddess
and
i
but
a
humble
neophyte
and
i
am
wrong
in
wishing
evil
to
the
scoundrel
for
it
was
owing
to
the
treacherous
and
cowardly
way
in
which
he
attacked
and
did
for
me
that
i
had
the
opportunity
i
had
so
long
wished
for
of
being
introduced
into
this
house
the
lucky
blow
on
my
forehead
with
his
stone
made
me
faint
and
because
you
saw
i
had
fainted
you
called
your
husband
it
was
on
account
of
your
husband
finding
me
without
consciousness
beneath
your
window
and
believing
i
had
been
set
upon
by
thieves
that
he
had
me
carried
indoors
and
lastly
because
you
were
so
moved
by
pity
at
the
thought
of
what
i
had
suffered
for
you
that
you
were
willing
to
let
me
in
here
and
so
this
fellow
this
contemptible
scamp
is
after
all
the
source
of
all
good
for
all
the
good
of
life
for
me
is
in
your
love
nevertheless
if
ever
he
comes
within
reach
of
my
whip
he
will
not
have
a
very
pleasant
time
of
it
seems
then
muttered
thibault
swearing
to
himself
that
my
wish
has
again
turned
to
the
advantage
of
someone
else
ah
my
friend
black
wolf
i
have
still
something
to
learn
but
confound
it
all
i
will
in
future
think
so
well
over
my
wishes
before
expressing
them
that
the
pupil
will
become
master
but
to
whom
does
that
voice
that
i
seem
to
know
belong
thibault
continued
trying
to
recall
it
for
the
voice
is
familiar
to
me
of
that
i
am
certain
you
would
be
even
more
incensed
against
him
poor
wretch
if
i
were
to
tell
you
and
what
is
that
my
love
well
that
fellow
as
you
call
him
is
making
love
to
phew
that
is
so
my
lord
said
madame
suzanne
laughing
what
that
boor
that
low
rascal
where
is
he
where
does
he
hide
himself
by
beelzebub
i
ll
throw
him
to
my
dogs
to
eat
and
then
all
at
once
thibault
recognised
his
man
ah
my
lord
baron
he
muttered
it
s
you
is
it
pray
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
it
my
lord
said
madame
suzanne
laying
her
two
hands
on
her
lover
s
shoulders
and
obliging
him
to
sit
down
again
your
lordship
is
the
only
person
whom
i
love
and
even
were
it
not
so
a
man
with
a
lock
of
red
hair
right
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
is
not
the
one
to
whom
i
should
give
away
my
and
as
the
recollection
of
this
lock
of
hair
which
had
made
her
laugh
so
at
dinner
came
back
to
her
she
again
gave
way
to
her
amusement
a
violent
feeling
of
anger
towards
the
bailiff
s
wife
took
possession
of
thibault
ah
traitress
he
exclaimed
to
himself
what
would
i
not
give
for
your
husband
your
good
upright
husband
to
walk
in
at
this
moment
and
surprise
scarcely
was
the
wish
uttered
when
the
door
of
communication
between
suzanne
s
room
and
that
of
monsieur
magloire
was
thrown
wide
open
and
in
walked
her
husband
with
an
enormous
on
his
head
which
made
him
look
nearly
five
feet
high
and
holding
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
ah
ah
muttered
thibault
well
done
it
s
my
turn
to
laugh
now
madame
chapter
xiii
where
it
is
demonstrated
that
a
woman
never
speaks
more
eloquently
than
when
she
holds
her
tongue
as
thibault
was
talking
to
himself
he
did
not
catch
the
few
hurried
words
which
suzanne
whispered
to
the
baron
and
all
he
saw
was
that
she
appeared
to
totter
and
then
fell
back
into
her
lover
s
arms
as
if
in
a
dead
faint
the
bailiff
stopped
short
as
he
caught
sight
of
this
curious
group
lit
up
by
his
candle
he
was
facing
thibault
and
the
latter
endeavoured
to
read
in
monsieur
magloire
s
face
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
but
the
bailiff
s
jovial
physiognomy
was
not
made
by
nature
to
express
any
strong
emotion
and
thibault
could
detect
nothing
in
it
but
a
benevolent
astonishment
on
the
part
of
the
amiable
husband
the
baron
also
evidently
detected
nothing
more
for
with
a
coolness
and
ease
of
manner
which
produced
on
thibault
a
surprise
beyond
expression
he
turned
to
the
bailiff
and
asked
well
friend
magloire
and
how
do
you
carry
your
wine
this
evening
why
is
it
you
my
lord
replied
the
bailiff
opening
his
fat
little
eyes
ah
pray
excuse
me
and
believe
me
had
i
known
i
was
to
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
here
i
should
not
have
allowed
myself
to
appear
in
such
an
unsuitable
nonsense
yes
indeed
my
lord
you
must
permit
me
to
go
and
make
a
little
no
ceremony
i
pray
rejoined
the
baron
after
curfew
one
is
at
least
free
to
receive
one
s
friends
in
what
costume
one
likes
besides
my
dear
friend
there
is
something
which
requires
more
immediate
what
is
that
my
lord
to
restore
madame
magloire
to
her
senses
who
you
see
has
fainted
in
my
fainted
suzanne
fainted
ah
my
god
cried
the
little
man
putting
down
his
candle
on
the
how
ever
did
such
a
misfortune
happen
wait
wait
monsieur
magloire
said
my
lord
we
must
first
get
your
wife
into
a
more
comfortable
position
in
an
armchair
nothing
annoys
women
so
much
as
not
to
be
at
their
ease
when
they
are
unfortunate
enough
to
you
are
right
my
lord
let
us
first
put
her
in
the
armchair
oh
suzanne
poor
suzanne
how
can
such
a
thing
as
this
have
happened
i
pray
you
at
least
my
dear
fellow
not
to
think
any
ill
of
me
at
finding
me
in
your
house
at
such
a
time
of
night
far
from
it
my
lord
replied
the
bailiff
the
friendship
with
which
you
honour
us
and
the
virtue
of
madame
magloire
are
sufficient
guarantees
for
me
to
be
glad
at
any
hour
to
have
my
house
honoured
by
your
triple
dyed
idiot
murmured
the
unless
i
ought
rather
to
call
him
a
doubly
clever
dissembler
no
matter
which
however
we
have
yet
to
see
how
my
lord
is
going
to
get
out
of
nevertheless
continued
maître
magloire
dipping
a
handkerchief
into
some
aromatic
water
and
bathing
his
wife
s
temples
with
it
nevertheless
i
am
curious
to
know
how
my
poor
wife
can
have
received
such
a
it
s
a
simple
affair
enough
as
i
will
explain
my
dear
fellow
i
was
returning
from
dining
with
my
friend
de
vivières
and
passing
through
erneville
on
my
way
to
vez
i
caught
sight
of
an
open
window
and
a
woman
inside
making
signals
of
ah
my
god
that
is
what
i
exclaimed
when
i
realised
that
the
window
belonged
to
your
house
and
can
it
be
my
friend
the
bailiff
s
wife
i
thought
who
is
in
danger
and
in
need
of
help
you
are
good
indeed
my
lord
said
the
bailiff
quite
overcome
i
trust
it
was
nothing
of
the
on
the
contrary
my
dear
how
on
the
contrary
yes
as
you
will
you
make
me
shudder
my
lord
and
do
you
mean
that
my
wife
was
in
need
of
help
and
did
not
call
me
it
had
been
her
first
thought
to
call
you
but
she
abstained
from
doing
so
for
and
here
you
see
her
delicacy
of
feeling
she
was
afraid
that
if
you
came
your
precious
life
might
be
the
bailiff
turned
pale
and
gave
an
exclamation
my
precious
life
as
you
are
good
enough
to
call
it
is
in
danger
not
now
since
i
am
but
tell
me
i
pray
my
lord
what
had
happened
i
would
question
my
wife
but
as
you
see
she
is
not
yet
able
to
and
am
i
not
here
to
answer
in
her
stead
answer
then
my
lord
as
you
are
kind
enough
to
offer
to
do
so
i
am
the
baron
made
a
gesture
of
assent
and
went
on
so
i
ran
to
her
and
seeing
her
all
trembling
and
alarmed
i
asked
what
is
the
matter
madame
magloire
and
what
is
causing
you
so
much
alarm
ah
my
lord
she
replied
just
think
what
i
feel
when
i
tell
you
that
yesterday
and
my
husband
has
been
entertaining
a
man
about
whom
i
have
the
worst
suspicions
ugh
a
man
who
has
introduced
himself
under
the
pretence
of
friendship
to
my
dear
magloire
and
actually
makes
love
to
me
to
me
she
told
you
that
word
for
word
my
dear
fellow
she
can
not
hear
what
we
are
saying
i
hope
how
can
she
when
she
is
insensible
well
ask
her
yourself
when
she
comes
to
and
if
she
does
not
tell
you
exactly
to
the
letter
what
i
have
been
telling
you
call
me
a
turk
an
infidel
and
a
ah
these
men
these
men
murmured
the
bailiff
yes
race
of
vipers
continued
my
lord
of
vez
do
you
wish
me
to
go
on
yes
indeed
said
the
little
man
forgetting
the
scantiness
of
his
attire
in
the
interest
excited
in
him
by
the
baron
s
tale
but
madame
i
said
to
my
friend
madame
magloire
how
could
you
tell
that
he
had
the
audacity
to
love
you
yes
put
in
the
bailiff
how
did
she
find
it
out
i
never
noticed
anything
you
would
have
been
aware
of
it
my
dear
friend
if
only
you
had
looked
under
the
table
but
fond
of
your
dinner
as
you
are
you
were
not
likely
to
be
looking
at
the
dishes
on
the
table
and
underneath
it
at
the
same
the
truth
is
my
lord
we
had
the
most
perfect
little
supper
just
you
think
now
cutlets
of
young
very
well
said
the
baron
now
you
are
going
to
tell
me
about
your
supper
instead
of
listening
to
the
end
of
my
tale
a
tale
which
concerns
the
life
and
honour
of
your
wife
true
true
my
poor
suzanne
my
lord
help
me
to
open
her
hands
that
i
may
slap
them
on
the
the
lord
of
vez
gave
all
the
assistance
in
his
power
to
monsieur
magloire
and
by
dint
of
their
united
efforts
they
forced
open
madame
magloire
s
hands
the
good
man
now
easier
in
his
mind
began
slapping
his
wife
s
palms
with
his
chubby
little
hands
all
the
while
giving
his
attention
to
the
remainder
of
the
baron
s
interesting
and
veracious
story
where
had
i
got
to
he
asked
you
had
got
just
to
where
my
poor
suzanne
whom
one
may
indeed
call
the
chaste
suzanna
yes
you
may
well
say
that
interrupted
the
lord
of
vez
indeed
i
do
you
had
just
got
to
where
my
poor
suzanne
began
to
be
aware
ah
yes
that
your
guest
like
paris
of
old
was
wishing
to
make
another
menelaus
of
you
well
then
she
rose
from
table
you
remember
that
she
did
so
no
i
was
perhaps
a
little
just
a
little
quite
so
well
then
she
rose
from
table
and
said
it
was
time
to
the
truth
is
that
the
last
hour
i
heard
strike
was
eleven
said
the
jovial
bailiff
then
the
party
broke
i
don
t
think
i
left
the
table
said
the
bailiff
no
but
madame
magloire
and
your
guest
did
she
told
him
which
was
his
room
and
perrine
showed
him
to
it
after
which
kind
and
faithful
wife
as
she
is
madame
magloire
tucked
you
into
bed
and
went
into
her
own
dear
little
suzanne
said
the
bailiff
in
a
voice
of
emotion
and
it
was
then
when
she
found
herself
in
her
room
and
all
alone
that
she
got
frightened
she
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
the
wind
blowing
into
the
room
put
out
her
candle
you
know
what
it
is
to
have
a
sudden
panic
come
over
you
do
you
not
oh
yes
replied
the
bailiff
naïvely
i
am
very
timid
after
that
she
was
seized
with
panic
and
not
daring
to
wake
you
for
fear
any
harm
should
come
to
you
she
called
to
the
first
horseman
she
saw
go
by
and
luckily
that
horseman
was
it
was
indeed
fortunate
my
was
it
not
i
ran
i
made
myself
come
up
my
lord
come
up
she
cried
come
up
quickly
i
am
sure
there
is
a
man
in
my
dear
dear
said
the
bailiff
you
must
indeed
have
felt
terribly
not
at
all
i
thought
it
was
only
losing
time
to
stop
and
ring
i
gave
my
horse
to
l
eveillé
i
stood
up
on
the
saddle
climbed
from
that
to
the
balcony
and
so
that
the
man
who
was
in
the
room
might
not
escape
i
shut
the
window
it
was
just
at
that
moment
that
madame
magloire
hearing
the
sound
of
your
door
opening
and
overcome
by
such
a
succession
of
painful
feelings
fell
fainting
into
my
ah
my
lord
said
the
bailiff
how
frightful
all
this
is
that
you
tell
and
be
sure
my
dear
friend
that
i
have
rather
softened
than
added
to
its
terror
anyhow
you
will
hear
what
madame
magloire
has
to
tell
you
when
she
comes
to
see
my
lord
she
is
beginning
to
that
s
right
burn
a
feather
under
her
a
feather
yes
it
is
a
sovereign
burn
a
feather
under
her
nose
and
she
will
revive
but
where
shall
i
find
a
feather
asked
the
bailiff
here
take
this
the
feather
round
my
and
the
lord
of
vez
broke
off
a
bit
of
the
ostrich
feather
which
ornamented
his
hat
gave
it
to
monsieur
magloire
who
lighted
it
at
the
candle
and
held
it
smoking
under
his
wife
s
nose
the
remedy
was
a
sovereign
one
as
the
baron
had
said
the
effect
of
it
was
instantaneous
madame
magloire
sneezed
ah
cried
the
bailiff
delightedly
now
she
is
coming
to
my
wife
my
dear
wife
my
dear
little
wife
madame
magloire
gave
a
sigh
my
lord
my
lord
cried
the
bailiff
she
is
saved
saved
madame
magloire
opened
her
eyes
looked
first
at
the
bailiff
and
then
at
the
baron
with
a
bewildered
gaze
and
then
finally
fixing
them
on
the
bailiff
magloire
dear
magloire
she
said
is
it
really
you
oh
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
again
after
the
bad
dream
i
have
had
well
muttered
thibault
she
is
a
huzzy
if
you
like
if
i
do
not
get
all
that
i
want
from
the
ladies
i
run
after
they
at
least
afford
me
some
valuable
object
lessons
by
the
way
alas
my
beautiful
suzanne
said
the
bailiff
it
is
no
bad
dream
you
have
had
but
as
it
seems
a
hideous
ah
i
remember
now
responded
madame
magloire
then
as
if
noticing
for
the
first
time
that
the
lord
of
vez
was
there
ah
my
lord
she
continued
i
hope
you
have
repeated
nothing
to
my
husband
of
all
those
foolish
things
i
told
you
and
why
not
dear
lady
asked
the
baron
because
an
honest
woman
knows
how
to
protect
herself
and
has
no
need
to
keep
on
telling
her
husband
a
lot
of
nonsense
like
on
the
contrary
madame
replied
the
baron
i
have
told
my
friend
do
you
mean
that
you
have
told
him
that
during
the
whole
of
supper
time
that
man
was
fondling
my
knee
under
the
table
i
told
him
that
oh
the
wretch
exclaimed
the
bailiff
and
that
when
i
stooped
to
pick
up
my
table
napkin
it
was
not
that
but
his
hand
that
i
came
i
have
hidden
nothing
from
my
friend
oh
the
ruffian
cried
the
bailiff
and
that
monsieur
magloire
having
a
passing
giddiness
which
made
him
shut
his
eyes
while
at
table
his
guest
took
the
opportunity
to
kiss
me
against
my
will
i
thought
it
was
right
for
a
husband
to
know
oh
the
knave
cried
the
bailiff
and
did
you
even
go
so
far
as
to
tell
him
that
having
come
into
my
room
and
the
wind
having
blown
out
the
candle
i
fancied
i
saw
the
window
curtains
move
which
made
me
call
to
you
for
help
believing
that
he
was
hidden
behind
them
no
i
did
not
tell
him
that
i
was
going
to
when
you
oh
the
vile
rascal
roared
the
bailiff
taking
hold
of
the
baron
s
sword
which
the
latter
had
laid
on
a
chair
and
drawing
it
out
of
the
scabbard
then
running
toward
the
window
which
his
wife
had
indicated
he
had
better
not
be
behind
these
curtains
or
i
will
spit
him
like
a
woodcock
and
with
this
he
gave
one
or
two
lunges
with
the
sword
against
the
window
hangings
but
all
at
once
the
bailiff
stayed
his
hand
and
stood
as
if
arrested
like
a
caught
trespassing
out
of
bounds
his
hair
rose
on
end
beneath
his
cotton
and
this
conjugal
became
agitated
as
by
some
convulsive
movement
the
sword
dropped
from
his
trembling
hand
and
fell
with
a
clatter
on
the
floor
he
had
caught
sight
of
thibault
behind
the
curtains
and
as
hamlet
kills
polonius
thinking
to
slay
his
father
s
murderer
so
he
believing
that
he
was
thrusting
at
nothing
had
nearly
killed
his
crony
of
the
night
before
who
had
already
had
time
enough
to
prove
himself
a
false
friend
moreover
as
he
had
lifted
the
curtain
with
the
point
of
the
sword
the
bailiff
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
seen
thibault
his
wife
and
the
lord
of
vez
had
both
been
participators
in
the
unexpected
vision
and
both
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
in
telling
their
tale
so
well
they
had
had
no
idea
that
they
were
so
near
the
truth
the
baron
too
had
not
only
seen
that
there
was
a
man
but
had
also
recognised
that
the
man
was
thibault
damn
me
he
exclaimed
as
he
went
nearer
to
him
if
i
mistake
not
this
is
my
old
acquaintance
the
man
with
the
how
how
man
with
the
asked
the
bailiff
his
teeth
chattering
as
he
spoke
anyway
i
trust
he
has
not
his
with
him
now
and
he
ran
behind
his
wife
for
protection
no
no
do
not
be
alarmed
said
the
lord
of
vez
even
if
he
has
got
it
with
him
i
promise
you
it
shall
not
stay
long
in
his
hands
so
master
poacher
he
went
on
addressing
himself
to
thibault
you
are
not
content
to
hunt
the
game
belonging
to
his
highness
the
duke
of
orleans
in
the
forest
of
but
you
must
come
and
make
excursions
in
the
open
and
poach
on
the
territory
of
my
friend
maître
magloire
a
poacher
do
you
say
exclaimed
the
bailiff
is
not
monsieur
thibault
a
landowner
the
proprietor
of
farms
living
in
his
country
house
on
the
income
from
his
estate
of
a
hundred
acres
what
he
said
the
baron
bursting
into
a
loud
guffaw
so
he
made
you
believe
all
that
stuff
did
he
the
rascal
has
got
a
clever
tongue
he
a
landowner
that
poor
starveling
why
the
only
property
he
possesses
is
what
my
wear
on
their
feet
the
wooden
shoes
he
gets
his
living
by
madame
suzanne
on
hearing
thibault
thus
classified
made
a
gesture
of
scorn
and
contempt
while
maître
magloire
drew
back
a
step
while
the
colour
mounted
to
his
face
not
that
the
good
little
man
was
proud
but
he
hated
all
kinds
of
deceit
it
was
not
because
he
had
clinked
glasses
with
a
that
he
turned
red
but
because
he
had
drunk
in
company
with
a
liar
and
a
traitor
during
this
avalanche
of
abuse
thibault
had
stood
immovable
with
his
arms
folded
and
a
smile
on
his
lips
he
had
no
fear
but
that
when
his
turn
came
to
speak
he
would
be
able
to
take
an
easy
revenge
and
the
moment
to
speak
seemed
now
to
have
come
in
a
light
bantering
tone
of
voice
which
showed
that
he
was
gradually
accustoming
himself
to
conversing
with
people
of
a
superior
rank
to
his
own
he
then
exclaimed
by
the
devil
and
his
horns
as
you
yourself
remarked
a
little
while
ago
you
can
tell
tales
of
other
people
my
lord
without
much
compunction
and
i
fancy
if
everyone
followed
your
example
i
should
not
be
at
such
a
loss
what
to
say
as
i
choose
to
appear
the
lord
of
vez
perfectly
aware
as
was
the
bailiff
s
wife
of
the
menace
conveyed
in
these
words
answered
by
looking
thibault
up
and
down
with
eyes
that
were
starting
with
anger
oh
said
madame
magloire
somewhat
imprudently
you
will
see
he
is
going
to
invent
some
scandalous
tale
about
have
no
fear
madame
replied
thibault
who
had
quite
recovered
his
you
have
left
me
nothing
to
invent
on
that
oh
the
vile
wretch
she
cried
you
see
i
was
right
he
has
got
some
malicious
slander
to
report
about
me
he
is
determined
to
revenge
himself
because
i
would
not
return
his
sheep
to
punish
me
because
i
was
not
willing
to
warn
my
husband
that
he
was
paying
court
to
during
this
speech
of
madame
suzanne
s
the
lord
of
vez
had
picked
up
his
sword
and
advanced
threateningly
towards
thibault
but
the
bailiff
threw
himself
between
them
and
held
back
the
baron
s
arm
it
was
fortunate
for
thibault
that
he
did
so
for
the
latter
did
not
move
an
inch
to
avoid
the
blow
evidently
prepared
at
the
last
moment
to
utter
some
terrible
wish
which
would
avert
the
danger
from
him
but
the
bailiff
interposing
thibault
had
no
need
to
resort
to
this
means
of
help
gently
my
lord
said
the
maître
magloire
this
man
is
not
worthy
our
anger
i
am
but
a
plain
citizen
myself
but
you
see
i
have
only
contempt
for
what
he
says
and
i
readily
forgive
him
the
way
in
which
he
has
endeavoured
to
abuse
my
madame
magloire
now
thought
that
her
moment
had
come
for
moistening
the
situation
of
affairs
with
her
tears
and
burst
into
loud
sobs
do
not
weep
dear
wife
said
the
bailiff
with
his
usual
kind
and
simple
of
what
could
this
man
accuse
you
even
suppose
he
had
something
to
bring
against
you
of
having
deceived
me
well
i
can
only
say
that
made
as
i
am
i
feel
i
still
have
favours
to
grant
you
and
thanks
to
render
you
for
all
the
happy
days
which
i
owe
to
you
do
not
fear
for
a
moment
that
this
apprehension
of
an
imaginary
evil
will
alter
my
behaviour
towards
you
i
shall
always
be
kind
and
indulgent
to
you
suzanne
and
as
i
shall
never
shut
my
heart
against
you
so
will
i
never
shut
my
door
against
my
friends
when
one
is
small
and
of
little
account
it
is
best
to
submit
quietly
and
to
trust
one
need
have
no
fear
then
but
of
cowards
and
and
i
am
convinced
i
am
happy
to
say
that
they
are
not
so
plentiful
as
they
are
thought
to
be
and
after
all
by
my
faith
if
the
bird
of
misfortune
should
fly
in
by
the
door
or
by
the
window
by
saint
gregory
the
patron
of
drinkers
there
shall
be
such
a
noise
of
singing
such
a
clinking
of
glasses
that
he
will
soon
be
obliged
to
fly
out
again
by
the
way
he
came
in
before
he
had
ended
madame
suzanne
had
thrown
herself
at
his
feet
and
was
kissing
his
hands
his
speech
with
its
mingling
of
sadness
and
philosophy
had
made
more
impression
upon
her
than
would
have
a
sermon
from
the
most
eloquent
of
preachers
even
the
lord
of
vez
did
not
remain
unmoved
a
tear
gathered
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
he
lifted
his
finger
to
wipe
it
away
before
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
bailiff
saying
as
he
did
so
by
the
horn
of
beelzebub
my
dear
friend
you
have
an
upright
mind
and
a
kind
heart
and
it
would
be
a
sin
indeed
to
bring
trouble
upon
you
and
if
i
have
ever
had
a
thought
of
doing
you
wrong
may
god
forgive
me
for
it
i
can
safely
swear
whatever
happens
that
i
shall
never
have
such
another
while
this
reconciliation
was
taking
place
between
the
three
secondary
actors
in
this
tale
the
situation
of
the
fourth
that
is
of
the
principal
character
in
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
embarrassing
thibault
s
heart
was
swelling
with
rage
and
hatred
himself
unaware
of
the
rapid
growth
of
evil
within
him
he
was
fast
growing
from
a
selfish
and
covetous
man
into
a
wicked
one
suddenly
his
eyes
flashing
he
cried
aloud
i
do
not
know
what
holds
me
back
from
putting
a
terrible
end
to
all
this
on
hearing
this
exclamation
which
had
all
the
character
of
a
menace
in
it
the
baron
and
suzanne
understood
it
to
mean
that
some
great
and
unknown
and
unexpected
danger
was
hanging
over
everybody
s
heads
but
the
baron
was
not
easily
intimidated
and
he
drew
his
sword
for
the
second
time
and
made
a
movement
towards
thibault
again
the
bailiff
interposed
my
lord
baron
my
lord
baron
said
thibault
in
a
low
voice
this
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
in
wish
at
least
passed
your
sword
through
my
body
twice
therefore
you
have
been
a
murderer
in
thought
take
care
one
can
sin
in
other
ways
besides
sinning
in
thousand
devils
cried
the
baron
beside
himself
with
anger
the
rascal
is
actually
reading
me
a
moral
lesson
my
friend
you
were
wanting
a
little
while
ago
to
spit
him
like
a
woodcock
allow
me
to
give
him
one
light
touch
such
as
the
matador
gives
the
bull
and
i
will
answer
for
it
that
he
won
t
get
up
again
in
a
i
beseech
you
on
my
knees
as
a
favour
to
your
humble
servant
my
lord
replied
the
bailiff
to
let
him
go
in
peace
and
deign
to
remember
that
being
my
guest
there
should
no
hurt
nor
harm
be
done
to
him
in
this
poor
house
of
so
be
it
answered
the
baron
i
shall
meet
him
again
all
kinds
of
bad
reports
are
about
concerning
him
and
poaching
is
not
the
only
harm
reported
of
him
he
has
been
seen
and
recognised
running
the
forest
along
with
a
pack
of
wolves
and
astonishingly
tame
wolves
at
that
it
s
my
opinion
that
the
scoundrel
does
not
always
spend
his
midnights
at
home
but
sits
astride
a
oftener
than
becomes
a
good
catholic
the
owner
of
the
mill
at
croyolles
has
made
complaint
of
his
wizardries
however
we
will
not
talk
of
it
any
more
now
i
shall
have
his
hut
searched
and
if
everything
there
is
not
as
it
should
be
the
wizard
s
hole
shall
be
destroyed
for
i
will
not
allow
it
to
remain
on
his
highness
s
territory
and
now
take
yourself
off
and
that
quickly
the
s
exasperation
had
come
to
a
pitch
during
this
menacing
tirade
from
the
baron
but
nevertheless
he
profited
by
the
passage
that
was
cleared
for
him
and
went
out
of
the
room
thanks
to
his
faculty
of
being
able
to
see
in
the
dark
he
walked
straight
to
the
door
opened
it
and
passed
over
the
threshold
of
the
house
where
he
had
left
behind
so
many
fond
hopes
now
lost
for
ever
slamming
the
door
after
him
with
such
violence
that
the
whole
house
shook
he
was
obliged
to
call
to
mind
the
useless
expenditure
of
wishes
and
hair
of
the
preceding
evening
to
keep
himself
from
asking
that
the
whole
house
and
all
within
it
might
be
devoured
by
the
flames
he
walked
on
for
ten
minutes
before
he
became
conscious
that
it
was
pouring
with
rain
but
the
rain
frozen
as
it
was
and
even
because
it
was
so
bitterly
cold
seemed
to
do
thibault
good
as
the
good
magloire
had
artlessly
remarked
his
head
was
on
fire
on
leaving
the
bailiffs
house
thibault
had
taken
the
first
road
he
came
to
he
had
no
wish
to
go
in
one
direction
more
than
another
all
he
wanted
was
space
fresh
air
and
movement
his
desultory
walking
brought
him
first
of
all
on
to
the
value
lands
but
even
then
he
did
not
notice
where
he
was
until
he
saw
the
mill
of
croyolles
in
the
distance
he
muttered
a
curse
against
its
fair
owner
as
he
passed
rushed
on
like
a
madman
between
vauciennes
and
croyolles
and
seeing
a
dark
mass
in
front
of
him
plunged
into
its
depths
this
dark
mass
was
the
forest
the
to
the
rear
of
ham
which
leads
from
croyolles
to
préciamont
was
now
ahead
of
him
and
into
this
he
turned
guided
solely
by
chance
chapter
xiv
a
village
wedding
he
had
made
but
a
few
steps
within
the
forest
when
he
found
himself
surrounded
by
his
wolves
he
was
pleased
to
see
them
again
he
slackened
his
pace
he
called
to
them
and
the
wolves
came
crowding
round
him
thibault
caressed
them
as
a
shepherd
might
his
sheep
as
a
keeper
of
the
hounds
his
dogs
they
were
his
flock
his
hunting
pack
a
flock
with
flaming
eyes
a
pack
with
looks
of
fire
overhead
among
the
bare
branches
the
were
hopping
and
fluttering
making
their
plaintive
calls
while
the
other
owls
uttered
their
melancholy
cries
in
concert
the
eyes
of
these
shone
like
winged
coals
flying
about
among
the
trees
and
there
was
thibault
in
the
middle
of
it
all
the
centre
of
the
devilish
circle
even
as
the
wolves
came
up
to
fawn
upon
him
and
crouch
at
his
feet
so
the
owls
appeared
to
be
attracted
towards
him
the
tips
of
their
silent
wings
brushed
against
his
hair
some
of
them
alighted
to
perch
upon
his
shoulder
ah
murmured
thibault
i
am
not
then
the
enemy
of
all
created
things
if
men
hate
me
the
animals
love
he
forgot
what
place
the
animals
who
loved
him
held
in
the
chain
of
created
beings
he
did
not
remember
that
these
animals
which
loved
him
were
those
which
hated
mankind
and
which
mankind
cursed
he
did
not
pause
to
reflect
that
these
animals
loved
him
because
he
had
become
among
men
what
they
were
among
animals
a
creature
of
the
night
a
man
of
prey
with
all
these
animals
together
he
could
not
do
an
atom
of
good
but
on
the
other
hand
he
could
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
thibault
smiled
at
the
thought
of
the
harm
he
could
do
he
was
still
some
distance
from
home
and
he
began
to
feel
tired
he
knew
there
was
a
large
hollow
oak
somewhere
near
and
he
took
his
bearings
and
made
for
it
but
he
would
have
missed
his
way
if
the
wolves
who
seemed
to
guess
his
thoughts
had
not
guided
him
to
it
while
flocks
of
owls
hopped
along
from
branch
to
branch
as
if
to
illuminate
the
way
the
wolves
trotted
along
in
front
to
show
it
him
the
tree
stood
about
twenty
paces
back
from
the
road
it
was
as
i
have
said
an
old
oak
numbering
not
years
but
centuries
trees
which
live
ten
twenty
thirty
times
the
length
of
a
man
s
life
do
not
count
their
age
by
days
and
nights
but
by
seasons
the
autumn
is
their
twilight
the
winter
their
night
the
spring
is
their
dawn
the
summer
their
day
man
envies
the
tree
the
butterfly
envies
man
forty
men
could
not
have
encircled
the
trunk
of
the
old
oak
with
their
arms
the
hollow
made
by
time
that
daily
dislodged
one
more
little
piece
of
wood
with
the
point
of
its
scythe
was
as
large
as
an
ordinarily
sized
room
but
the
entrance
to
it
barely
allowed
a
man
to
pass
through
thibault
crept
inside
there
he
found
a
sort
of
seat
cut
out
of
the
thickness
of
the
trunk
as
soft
and
comfortable
to
sit
in
as
an
arm
chair
taking
his
place
in
it
and
bidding
good
night
to
his
wolves
and
his
screech
owls
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
or
at
least
appeared
to
do
so
the
wolves
lay
down
in
a
circle
round
the
tree
the
owls
perched
in
the
branches
with
these
lights
spread
around
its
trunk
with
these
lights
scattered
about
its
branches
the
oak
had
the
appearance
of
a
tree
lit
up
for
some
infernal
revel
it
was
broad
daylight
when
thibault
awoke
the
wolves
had
long
ago
sought
their
the
owls
flown
back
to
their
ruins
the
rain
of
the
night
before
had
ceased
and
a
ray
of
sunlight
one
of
those
pale
rays
which
are
a
harbinger
of
spring
came
gliding
through
the
naked
branches
of
the
trees
and
having
as
yet
none
of
the
verdure
of
the
year
to
shine
upon
lit
up
the
dark
green
of
the
mistletoe
from
afar
came
a
faint
sound
of
music
gradually
it
grew
nearer
and
the
notes
of
two
violins
and
a
hautboy
could
be
distinguished
thibault
thought
at
first
that
he
must
be
dreaming
but
as
it
was
broad
daylight
and
he
appeared
to
be
in
perfect
possession
of
his
senses
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
wide
awake
the
more
so
that
having
well
rubbed
his
eyes
to
make
quite
sure
of
the
fact
the
rustic
sounds
came
as
distinctly
as
ever
to
his
ear
they
were
drawing
rapidly
nearer
a
bird
sang
answering
the
music
of
man
with
the
music
of
god
and
at
the
foot
of
the
bush
where
it
sat
and
made
its
song
a
flower
only
a
snowdrop
it
is
true
was
shining
like
a
star
the
sky
above
was
as
blue
as
on
an
april
day
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
festival
now
in
the
heart
of
winter
the
notes
of
the
bird
as
it
sang
in
salutation
of
this
bright
unexpected
day
the
brightness
of
the
flower
that
shone
as
if
with
its
radiance
to
thank
the
sun
for
coming
to
visit
it
the
sounds
of
which
told
the
lost
and
unhappy
man
that
his
were
joining
with
the
rest
of
nature
in
their
rejoicings
under
the
azure
canopy
of
heaven
all
the
aroma
of
joy
all
this
of
happiness
brought
no
calmer
thoughts
back
to
thibault
but
rather
increased
the
anger
and
bitterness
of
his
feelings
he
would
have
liked
the
whole
world
to
be
as
dark
and
gloomy
as
was
his
own
soul
on
first
detecting
the
sounds
of
the
approaching
rural
band
he
thought
of
running
away
from
it
but
a
power
stronger
than
his
will
as
it
seemed
to
him
held
him
rooted
to
the
spot
so
he
hid
himself
in
the
hollow
of
the
oak
and
waited
merry
voices
and
lively
songs
could
be
heard
mingling
with
the
notes
of
the
violins
and
hautboy
now
and
again
a
gun
went
off
or
a
cracker
exploded
and
thibault
felt
sure
that
all
these
festive
sounds
must
be
occasioned
by
some
village
wedding
he
was
right
for
he
soon
caught
sight
of
a
procession
of
villagers
all
dressed
in
their
best
with
long
ribands
of
many
colours
floating
in
the
breeze
some
from
the
women
s
waists
some
from
the
men
s
hats
or
they
emerged
into
view
at
the
end
of
the
long
lane
of
ham
they
were
headed
by
the
fiddlers
then
followed
a
few
peasants
and
among
them
some
figures
which
by
their
livery
thibault
recognised
as
keepers
in
the
service
of
the
lord
of
vez
then
came
engoulevent
the
second
huntsman
giving
his
arm
to
an
old
blind
woman
who
was
decked
out
with
ribands
like
the
others
then
the
of
the
castle
of
vez
as
representative
probably
of
the
father
of
the
little
huntsman
giving
his
arm
to
the
bride
and
the
bride
herself
thibault
stared
at
her
with
wild
fixed
eyes
he
endeavoured
but
vainly
to
persuade
himself
that
he
did
not
recognise
her
it
was
impossible
not
to
do
so
when
she
came
within
a
few
paces
from
where
he
was
hiding
the
bride
was
agnelette
agnelette
and
to
crown
his
humiliation
as
if
to
give
a
final
blow
to
his
pride
no
pale
and
trembling
agnelette
dragged
reluctantly
to
the
altar
casting
looks
behind
her
of
regret
or
remembrance
but
an
agnelette
as
bright
and
happy
as
the
bird
that
was
singing
the
snowdrop
that
flowered
the
sunlight
that
was
shining
an
agnelette
full
of
delighted
pride
in
her
wreath
of
orange
flowers
her
tulle
veil
and
muslin
dress
an
agnelette
in
short
as
fair
and
smiling
as
the
virgin
in
the
church
at
when
dressed
in
her
beautiful
white
dress
at
whitsuntide
she
was
no
doubt
indebted
for
all
this
finery
to
the
lady
of
the
castle
the
wife
of
the
lord
of
vez
who
was
a
true
lady
bountiful
in
such
matters
but
the
chief
cause
of
agnelette
s
happiness
and
smiles
was
not
the
great
love
she
felt
towards
the
man
who
was
to
become
her
husband
but
her
contentment
at
having
found
what
she
so
ardently
desired
that
which
thibault
had
wickedly
promised
to
her
without
really
wishing
to
give
her
someone
who
would
help
her
to
support
her
blind
old
grandmother
the
musicians
the
bride
and
bridegroom
the
young
men
and
maidens
passed
along
the
road
within
twenty
paces
of
thibault
without
observing
the
head
with
its
flaming
hair
and
the
eyes
with
their
fiery
gleam
looking
out
from
the
hollow
of
the
tree
then
as
thibault
had
watched
them
appear
through
the
undergrowth
so
he
watched
them
disappear
as
the
sounds
of
the
violins
and
hautboy
has
gradually
become
louder
and
louder
so
now
they
became
fainter
and
fainter
until
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
the
forest
was
as
silent
and
deserted
as
ever
and
thibault
was
left
alone
with
his
singing
bird
his
flowering
snowdrop
his
glittering
ray
of
sunlight
but
a
new
fire
of
hell
had
been
lighted
in
his
heart
the
worst
of
the
fires
of
hell
that
which
gnaws
at
the
vitals
like
the
sharpest
serpent
s
tooth
and
corrodes
the
blood
like
the
most
destructive
poison
the
fire
of
jealousy
on
seeing
agnelette
again
so
fresh
and
pretty
so
innocently
happy
and
worse
still
seeing
her
at
the
moment
when
she
was
about
to
be
married
to
another
thibault
who
had
not
given
a
thought
to
her
for
the
last
three
month
thibault
who
had
never
had
any
intention
of
keeping
the
promise
which
he
made
her
thibault
now
brought
himself
to
believe
that
he
had
never
ceased
to
love
her
he
persuaded
himself
that
agnelette
was
engaged
to
him
by
oath
that
engoulevent
was
carrying
off
what
belonged
to
him
and
he
almost
leaped
from
his
hiding
place
to
rush
after
her
and
reproach
her
with
her
infidelity
agnelette
now
no
longer
his
at
once
appeared
to
his
eyes
as
endowed
with
all
the
virtues
and
good
qualities
all
in
short
that
would
make
it
advantageous
to
marry
her
which
when
he
had
only
to
speak
the
word
and
everything
would
have
been
his
he
had
not
even
suspected
after
being
the
victim
of
so
much
deception
to
lose
what
he
looked
upon
as
his
own
particular
treasure
to
which
he
had
imagined
that
it
would
not
be
too
late
to
return
at
any
time
simply
because
he
never
dreamed
that
anyone
would
wish
to
take
it
from
him
seemed
to
him
the
last
stroke
of
ill
fortune
his
despair
was
no
less
profound
and
gloomy
that
it
was
a
mute
despair
he
bit
his
fists
he
knocked
his
head
against
the
sides
of
the
tree
and
finally
began
to
cry
and
sob
but
they
were
not
those
tears
and
sobs
which
gradually
soften
the
heart
and
are
often
kindly
agents
in
dispersing
a
bad
humour
and
reviving
a
better
one
no
they
were
tears
and
sobs
arising
rather
from
anger
than
from
regret
and
these
tears
and
sobs
had
no
power
to
drive
the
hatred
out
of
thibault
s
heart
as
some
of
his
tears
fell
visibly
adown
his
face
so
it
seemed
that
others
fell
on
his
heart
within
like
drops
of
gall
he
declared
that
he
loved
agnelette
he
lamented
at
having
lost
her
nevertheless
this
furious
man
with
all
his
tender
love
would
gladly
have
been
able
to
see
her
fall
dead
together
with
her
bridegroom
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
when
the
priest
was
about
to
join
them
but
happily
god
who
was
reserving
the
two
children
for
other
trials
did
not
allow
this
fatal
wish
to
formulate
itself
in
thibault
s
mind
they
were
like
those
who
surrounded
by
storm
hear
the
noise
of
the
thunder
and
see
the
forked
flashes
of
the
lightning
and
yet
remain
untouched
by
the
deadly
fluid
before
long
the
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
his
tears
and
sobs
he
forced
back
the
former
and
made
an
effort
to
swallow
the
latter
he
came
out
of
his
lair
not
quite
knowing
where
he
was
and
rushed
off
in
the
direction
of
his
hut
covering
a
league
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
this
mad
race
however
by
causing
him
to
perspire
somewhat
calmed
him
down
at
last
he
recognised
the
surroundings
of
his
home
he
went
into
his
hut
as
a
tiger
might
enter
its
den
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
went
and
crouched
down
in
the
darkest
corner
he
could
find
in
his
miserable
lodging
there
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
chin
on
his
hands
he
sat
and
thought
and
what
thoughts
were
they
which
occupied
this
unhappy
desperate
man
ask
of
milton
what
were
satan
s
thoughts
after
his
fall
he
went
over
again
all
the
old
questions
which
had
upset
his
mind
from
the
beginning
which
had
brought
despair
upon
so
many
before
him
and
would
bring
despair
to
so
many
that
came
after
him
why
should
some
be
born
in
bondage
and
others
be
born
to
power
why
should
there
be
so
much
inequality
with
regard
to
a
thing
which
takes
place
in
exactly
the
same
way
in
all
classes
namely
birth
by
what
means
can
this
game
of
nature
s
in
which
chance
for
ever
holds
the
cards
against
mankind
be
made
a
fairer
one
and
is
not
the
only
way
to
accomplish
this
to
do
what
the
clever
gamester
does
get
the
devil
to
back
him
up
he
had
certainly
thought
so
once
to
cheat
he
had
tried
that
game
himself
and
what
had
he
gained
by
it
each
time
he
had
held
a
good
hand
each
time
he
had
felt
sure
of
the
game
it
was
the
devil
after
all
who
had
won
what
benefit
had
he
reaped
from
this
deadly
power
that
had
been
given
him
of
working
evil
to
others
none
agnelette
had
been
taken
from
him
the
owner
of
the
mill
had
driven
him
away
the
bailiff
s
wife
had
made
game
of
him
his
first
wish
had
caused
the
death
of
poor
marcotte
and
had
not
even
procured
him
a
haunch
of
the
buck
that
he
had
been
so
ambitious
to
obtain
and
this
had
been
the
starting
point
of
all
his
disappointed
longings
for
he
had
been
obliged
to
give
the
buck
to
the
dogs
so
as
to
put
them
off
the
scent
of
the
black
wolf
and
then
this
rapid
multiplication
of
devil
s
hairs
was
appalling
he
recalled
the
tale
of
the
philosopher
who
asked
for
a
grain
of
wheat
multiplied
by
each
of
the
squares
of
the
chess
board
the
abundant
harvests
of
a
thousand
years
were
required
to
fill
the
last
square
and
he
how
many
wishes
yet
remained
to
him
seven
or
eight
at
the
outside
the
unhappy
man
dared
not
look
at
himself
either
in
the
spring
which
lurked
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
trees
in
the
forest
or
in
the
mirror
that
hung
against
the
wall
he
feared
to
render
an
exact
account
to
himself
of
the
time
still
left
to
him
in
which
to
exercise
his
power
he
preferred
to
remain
in
the
night
of
uncertainty
than
to
face
that
terrible
dawn
which
must
rise
when
the
night
was
over
but
still
there
must
be
a
way
of
continuing
matters
so
that
the
misfortunes
of
others
should
bring
him
good
of
some
kind
he
thought
surely
that
if
he
had
received
a
scientific
education
instead
of
being
a
poor
scarcely
knowing
how
to
read
or
cypher
he
would
have
found
out
by
the
aid
of
science
some
combinations
which
would
infallibly
have
procured
for
him
both
riches
and
happiness
poor
fool
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
learning
he
would
have
known
the
legend
of
doctor
faust
to
what
did
the
omnipotence
conferred
on
him
by
mephistopheles
lead
faust
the
dreamer
the
thinker
the
scholar
to
the
murder
of
valentine
to
margaret
s
suicide
to
the
pursuit
of
helen
of
troy
the
pursuit
of
an
empty
shadow
and
moreover
how
could
thibault
think
coherently
at
all
of
ways
and
means
while
jealousy
was
raging
in
his
heart
while
he
continued
to
picture
agnelette
at
the
altar
giving
herself
for
life
to
another
than
himself
and
who
was
that
other
that
wretched
little
engoulevent
the
man
who
had
spied
him
out
when
he
was
perched
in
the
tree
who
had
found
his
in
the
bush
which
had
been
the
cause
of
the
stripes
he
had
received
from
marcotte
ah
if
he
had
but
known
to
him
and
not
to
marcotte
would
he
have
willed
that
evil
should
befall
what
was
the
physical
torture
he
had
undergone
from
the
blows
of
the
strap
compared
to
the
moral
torture
he
was
enduring
now
and
if
only
ambition
had
not
taken
such
hold
upon
him
had
not
borne
him
on
the
wings
of
pride
above
his
sphere
what
happiness
might
have
been
his
as
the
clever
workman
able
to
earn
as
much
as
six
francs
a
day
with
agnelette
for
his
charming
little
housekeeper
for
he
had
certainly
been
the
one
whom
agnelette
had
first
loved
perhaps
although
marrying
another
man
she
still
loved
him
and
as
thibault
sat
pondering
over
these
things
he
became
conscious
that
time
was
passing
that
night
was
approaching
however
modest
might
be
the
fortune
of
the
wedded
pair
however
limited
the
desires
of
the
peasants
who
had
followed
them
it
was
quite
certain
that
bride
bridegroom
and
peasants
were
all
at
this
hour
feasting
merrily
together
and
he
he
was
sad
and
alone
there
was
no
one
to
prepare
a
meal
for
him
and
what
was
there
in
his
house
to
eat
or
drink
a
little
bread
a
little
water
and
solitude
in
place
of
that
blessing
from
heaven
which
we
call
a
sister
a
mistress
a
wife
but
after
all
why
should
not
he
also
dine
merrily
and
abundantly
could
he
not
go
and
dine
wheresoever
he
liked
had
he
not
money
in
his
pocket
from
the
last
game
he
had
sold
to
the
host
of
the
and
could
he
not
spend
on
himself
as
much
as
the
wedded
couple
and
all
their
guests
together
he
had
only
himself
to
please
and
by
my
faith
he
exclaimed
i
am
an
idiot
indeed
to
stay
here
with
my
brain
racked
by
jealousy
and
my
stomach
with
hunger
when
with
the
aid
of
a
good
dinner
and
two
or
three
bottles
of
wine
i
can
rid
myself
of
both
torments
before
another
hour
is
over
i
will
be
off
to
get
food
and
better
still
to
get
drink
in
order
to
carry
this
determination
into
effect
thibault
took
the
road
to
where
there
was
an
excellent
restaurant
known
as
the
d
able
it
was
said
to
serve
up
dinners
equal
to
those
provided
by
his
head
cook
for
his
highness
the
duke
of
orleans
xv
the
lord
of
vauparfond
thibault
on
arriving
at
the
d
ordered
himself
as
fine
a
dinner
as
he
could
think
of
it
would
have
been
quite
easy
for
him
to
have
engaged
a
private
room
but
he
would
not
then
have
enjoyed
the
personal
sense
of
superiority
he
wished
the
company
of
ordinary
diners
to
see
him
eat
his
pullet
and
his
eel
in
its
delicate
sauce
he
wished
the
other
drinkers
to
envy
him
his
three
different
wines
drunk
out
of
three
different
shaped
glasses
he
wished
everybody
to
hear
him
give
his
orders
in
a
haughty
voice
to
hear
the
ring
of
his
money
as
he
gave
his
first
order
a
man
in
a
grey
coat
seated
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
with
a
half
bottle
of
wine
before
him
turned
round
as
if
recognising
a
voice
he
knew
and
as
it
turned
out
this
was
one
of
thibault
s
acquaintances
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
a
tavern
acquaintance
thibault
since
he
had
given
up
making
shoes
by
day
and
instead
had
his
wolves
about
at
night
had
made
many
such
acquaintances
on
seeing
that
it
was
thibault
the
other
man
turned
his
face
away
quickly
but
not
so
quickly
but
that
thibault
had
time
to
recognise
auguste
françois
levasseur
valet
to
raoul
the
lord
of
vauparfond
halloa
françois
thibault
called
out
what
are
you
doing
sitting
there
in
the
corner
and
sulking
like
a
monk
in
lent
instead
of
taking
your
dinner
openly
and
cheerfully
as
i
am
doing
in
full
view
of
everybody
françois
made
no
reply
to
this
interrogation
but
signed
to
thibault
to
hold
his
tongue
i
am
not
to
speak
not
to
speak
said
thibault
and
supposing
it
does
not
suit
me
to
hold
my
tongue
supposing
i
wish
to
talk
and
that
i
am
bored
at
having
to
dine
alone
and
that
it
pleases
me
to
say
friend
françois
come
here
i
invite
you
to
dine
with
me
you
will
not
no
very
well
then
i
shall
come
and
fetch
and
thibault
rose
from
his
seat
and
followed
by
all
eyes
went
up
to
his
friend
and
gave
him
a
slap
on
the
shoulder
vigorous
enough
to
dislocate
it
pretend
that
you
have
made
a
mistake
thibault
or
you
will
lose
me
my
place
do
you
not
see
that
i
am
not
in
livery
but
am
only
wearing
my
drab
i
am
here
as
proxy
in
a
love
affair
for
my
master
and
i
am
waiting
for
a
letter
from
a
lady
to
carry
back
to
that
s
another
matter
altogether
and
i
understand
now
and
am
sorry
for
my
indiscretion
i
should
like
however
to
have
dined
in
your
well
nothing
is
easier
order
your
dinner
to
be
served
in
a
separate
room
and
i
will
give
word
to
our
host
that
if
another
man
dressed
in
grey
like
me
comes
in
he
is
to
show
him
upstairs
he
and
i
are
old
cronies
and
understand
one
good
said
thibault
and
he
therewith
ordered
his
dinner
to
be
taken
up
to
a
room
on
the
first
floor
which
looked
out
upon
the
street
françois
seated
himself
so
as
to
be
able
to
see
the
person
he
was
expecting
while
some
distance
off
as
he
came
down
the
hill
of
the
dinner
which
thibault
had
ordered
was
quite
sufficient
for
the
two
all
that
he
did
was
to
send
for
another
bottle
or
so
of
wine
thibault
had
only
taken
two
lessons
from
maître
magloire
but
he
had
been
an
apt
pupil
and
they
had
done
their
work
moreover
thibault
had
something
which
he
wished
to
forget
and
he
counted
on
the
wine
to
accomplish
this
for
him
it
was
good
fortune
he
felt
to
have
met
a
friend
with
whom
he
could
talk
for
in
the
state
of
mind
and
heart
in
which
he
was
talking
was
as
good
a
help
towards
oblivion
as
drinking
accordingly
he
was
no
sooner
seated
and
the
door
shut
and
his
hat
stuck
well
down
on
to
his
head
so
that
françois
might
not
notice
the
change
in
the
colour
of
his
hair
than
he
burst
at
once
into
conversation
boldly
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
now
friend
françois
he
said
you
are
going
to
explain
to
me
some
of
your
words
which
i
did
not
quite
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
replied
françois
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
an
air
of
conceited
impertinence
we
attendants
on
fashionable
lords
learn
to
speak
court
language
which
everyone
of
course
does
not
perhaps
not
but
if
you
explain
it
to
your
friends
they
may
possibly
quite
so
ask
what
you
like
and
i
will
i
look
to
your
doing
so
the
more
that
i
will
undertake
to
supply
you
with
what
will
help
to
loosen
your
tongue
first
let
me
ask
why
do
you
call
yourself
a
i
thought
another
name
for
a
yourself
friend
thibault
said
françois
laughing
at
the
s
ignorance
no
a
is
a
liveried
servant
who
puts
on
a
grey
overall
to
hide
his
livery
while
he
stands
sentinel
behind
a
pillar
or
mounts
guard
inside
a
so
you
mean
that
at
this
moment
then
my
good
françois
you
are
on
sentry
go
and
who
is
coming
to
relieve
you
champagne
who
is
in
the
comtesse
de
s
i
see
i
understand
exactly
your
master
the
lord
of
vauparfond
is
in
love
with
the
comtesse
de
and
you
are
now
awaiting
a
letter
which
champagne
is
to
bring
from
the
as
the
tutor
to
monsieur
raoul
s
young
brother
my
lord
raoul
is
a
lucky
fellow
yes
indeed
said
françois
drawing
himself
up
and
what
a
beautiful
creature
the
countess
is
you
know
her
then
i
have
seen
her
out
hunting
with
his
highness
the
duke
of
orleans
and
madame
de
thibault
in
speaking
had
said
my
friend
let
me
tell
you
that
in
society
we
do
not
say
and
but
and
oh
said
thibault
i
am
not
so
particular
to
a
letter
as
all
that
to
the
health
of
my
lord
raoul
as
françois
put
down
his
glass
on
the
table
he
uttered
an
exclamation
he
had
that
moment
caught
sight
of
champagne
they
threw
open
the
window
and
called
to
this
third
comer
and
champagne
with
all
the
ready
intuition
of
the
servant
understood
at
once
and
went
upstairs
he
was
dressed
like
françois
in
a
long
grey
coat
and
had
brought
a
letter
with
him
well
asked
françois
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
is
there
to
be
a
meeting
yes
answered
champagne
with
evident
delight
that
s
all
right
said
françois
cheerfully
thibault
was
surprised
at
these
expressions
of
apparent
sympathy
on
the
part
of
the
servants
with
their
master
s
happiness
is
it
your
master
s
good
luck
that
you
are
so
pleased
about
he
asked
of
françois
oh
dear
me
no
replied
the
latter
but
when
my
master
is
engaged
i
am
at
liberty
and
do
you
make
use
of
your
liberty
one
may
be
a
valet
and
yet
have
one
s
own
share
of
good
luck
and
also
know
how
to
spend
the
time
more
or
less
profitably
answered
françois
bridling
as
he
spoke
and
you
champagne
oh
i
replied
the
last
comer
holding
his
wine
up
to
the
light
yes
i
too
hope
to
make
good
use
of
well
then
here
s
to
all
your
love
affairs
since
everybody
seems
to
have
one
or
more
on
hand
said
thibault
the
same
to
yours
replied
the
two
other
men
in
chorus
as
to
myself
said
the
a
look
of
hatred
to
his
fellow
creatures
passing
over
his
face
i
am
the
only
person
who
loves
nobody
and
whom
nobody
his
companion
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
surprised
curiosity
ah
ah
said
françois
is
the
report
that
is
whispered
abroad
about
you
in
the
a
true
tale
then
report
about
me
yes
about
you
put
in
champagne
oh
then
they
say
the
same
thing
about
me
at
as
they
do
at
vauparfond
champagne
nodded
his
head
well
and
what
is
it
they
do
say
that
you
are
a
said
françois
thibault
laughed
aloud
tell
me
now
have
i
a
tail
he
said
have
i
a
wolf
s
claws
have
i
a
wolf
s
snout
we
only
repeat
what
other
people
say
rejoined
champagne
we
do
not
say
that
it
is
well
anyhow
you
must
acknowledge
said
thibault
that
have
excellent
by
my
faith
yes
exclaimed
both
the
valets
to
the
health
of
the
devil
who
provides
it
the
two
men
who
were
holding
their
glasses
in
their
hand
put
both
glasses
down
on
the
table
what
is
that
for
asked
thibault
you
must
find
someone
else
to
drink
that
health
with
you
said
françois
i
won
t
that
s
flat
nor
i
added
champagne
well
and
good
then
i
will
drink
all
three
glasses
myself
and
he
immediately
proceeded
to
do
so
friend
thibault
said
the
baron
s
valet
it
is
time
we
so
soon
said
thibault
my
master
is
awaiting
me
and
no
doubt
with
some
impatience
the
letter
champagne
here
it
let
us
take
farewell
then
of
your
friend
thibault
and
be
off
to
our
business
and
our
pleasures
and
leave
him
to
his
pleasures
and
and
so
saying
françois
winked
at
his
friend
who
responded
with
a
similar
sign
of
understanding
between
them
we
must
not
separate
said
thibault
without
drinking
a
but
not
in
those
glasses
said
françois
pointing
to
the
three
from
which
thibault
had
drunk
to
the
enemy
of
mankind
you
are
very
particular
gentlemen
better
call
the
sacristan
and
have
them
washed
in
holy
not
quite
that
but
rather
than
refuse
the
polite
invitation
of
a
friend
we
will
call
for
the
waiter
and
have
fresh
glasses
these
three
then
said
thibault
who
was
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
wine
he
had
drunk
are
fit
for
nothing
more
than
to
be
thrown
out
of
window
to
the
devil
with
you
he
exclaimed
as
he
took
up
one
of
them
and
sent
it
flying
as
the
glass
went
through
the
air
it
left
a
track
of
light
behind
it
which
blazed
and
went
out
like
a
flash
of
lightning
thibault
took
up
the
two
remaining
glasses
and
threw
them
in
turn
and
each
time
the
same
thing
happened
but
the
third
flash
was
followed
by
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
thibault
shut
the
window
and
was
thinking
as
he
turned
to
his
seat
again
how
he
should
explain
this
strange
occurrence
to
his
companions
but
his
two
companions
had
disappeared
cowards
he
muttered
then
he
looked
for
a
glass
but
found
none
left
hum
that
s
awkward
he
said
i
must
drink
out
of
the
bottle
that
s
all
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
thibault
finished
up
his
dinner
by
draining
the
bottle
which
did
not
help
to
steady
his
brain
already
somewhat
shaky
at
nine
o
clock
thibault
called
the
innkeeper
paid
his
account
and
departed
he
was
in
an
angry
disposition
of
enmity
against
all
the
world
the
thoughts
from
which
he
had
hoped
to
escape
possessed
him
more
and
more
agnelette
was
being
taken
farther
and
farther
from
him
as
the
time
went
by
everyone
wife
or
mistress
had
someone
to
love
them
this
day
which
had
been
one
of
hatred
and
despair
to
him
had
been
one
full
of
the
promise
of
joy
and
happiness
for
everybody
else
the
lord
of
vauparfond
the
two
wretched
valets
françois
and
champagne
each
of
them
had
a
bright
star
of
hope
to
follow
while
he
he
alone
went
stumbling
along
in
the
darkness
decidedly
there
was
a
curse
upon
him
but
he
went
on
thinking
to
himself
if
so
the
pleasures
of
the
damned
belong
to
me
and
i
have
a
right
to
claim
as
these
thoughts
went
surging
through
his
brain
as
he
walked
along
cursing
aloud
shaking
his
fist
at
the
sky
he
was
on
the
way
to
his
hut
and
had
nearly
reached
it
when
he
heard
a
horse
coming
up
behind
him
at
a
gallop
ah
said
thibault
here
comes
the
lord
of
vauparfond
hastening
to
the
meeting
with
his
love
i
should
laugh
my
fine
sir
raoul
if
my
lord
of
managed
just
to
catch
you
you
would
not
get
off
quite
so
easily
as
if
it
were
maître
magloire
there
would
be
swords
out
and
blows
given
and
received
thus
engaged
in
thinking
what
would
happen
if
the
comte
de
were
to
surprise
his
rival
thibault
who
was
walking
in
the
road
evidently
did
not
get
out
of
the
way
quickly
enough
for
the
horseman
seeing
a
peasant
of
some
kind
barring
his
passage
brought
his
whip
down
upon
him
in
a
violent
blow
calling
out
at
the
same
time
get
out
of
the
way
you
beggar
if
you
don
t
wish
to
be
trampled
under
the
horse
s
feet
thibault
still
half
drunk
was
conscious
of
a
crowd
of
mingled
sensations
of
the
lashing
of
the
whip
the
collision
with
the
horse
and
the
rolling
through
cold
water
and
mud
while
the
horseman
passed
on
he
rose
to
his
knees
furious
with
anger
and
shaking
his
fist
at
the
retreating
figure
would
the
devil
he
exclaimed
i
might
just
for
once
have
my
turn
at
being
one
of
you
great
lords
might
just
for
hours
take
your
place
monsieur
raoul
de
vauparfond
instead
of
being
only
thibault
the
so
that
i
might
know
what
it
was
to
have
a
fine
horse
to
ride
instead
of
tramping
on
foot
might
be
able
to
whip
the
peasants
i
met
on
the
road
and
have
the
opportunity
of
paying
court
to
these
beautiful
women
who
deceive
their
husbands
as
the
comtesse
de
does
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
baron
s
horse
shied
throwing
the
rider
over
its
head
chapter
xvi
my
lady
s
lady
thibault
was
delighted
at
seeing
what
had
happened
to
the
young
baron
whose
hand
anything
but
light
had
so
shortly
before
made
use
of
his
whip
on
thibault
s
shoulders
which
still
smarted
with
the
blow
the
latter
now
ran
at
full
speed
to
see
how
far
monsieur
raoul
de
vauparfond
was
injured
he
found
a
body
lying
insensible
stretched
across
the
road
with
the
horse
standing
and
snorting
beside
it
but
thibault
could
hardly
believe
his
senses
on
perceiving
that
the
figure
lying
in
the
road
was
not
the
same
as
had
but
five
minutes
previously
ridden
past
him
and
given
him
the
lash
with
the
whip
in
the
first
place
this
figure
was
not
in
the
dress
of
a
gentleman
but
clothed
like
a
peasant
and
what
was
more
the
clothes
he
had
on
seemed
to
thibault
to
be
the
same
as
he
himself
had
been
wearing
only
a
moment
before
his
surprise
increased
more
and
more
and
amounted
almost
to
stupefaction
on
further
recognising
in
the
inert
unconscious
figure
not
only
his
own
clothes
but
his
own
face
his
astonishment
naturally
led
him
to
turn
his
eyes
from
this
second
thibault
to
his
own
person
when
he
became
aware
that
an
equally
remarkable
change
had
come
over
his
costume
instead
of
shoes
and
gaiters
his
legs
were
now
encased
in
an
elegant
pair
of
hunting
boots
reaching
to
the
knee
as
soft
and
smooth
as
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
with
a
roll
over
the
instep
and
finished
off
with
a
pair
of
fine
silver
spurs
the
were
no
longer
of
corduroy
but
of
the
most
beautiful
buckskin
fastened
with
little
gold
buckles
his
long
coarse
coat
was
replaced
by
a
handsome
green
with
gold
lace
facings
thrown
open
to
display
a
waistcoat
of
fine
white
jean
while
over
the
artistically
pleated
shirt
hung
the
soft
wavy
folds
of
a
cambric
cravat
not
a
single
article
of
dress
about
him
but
had
been
transformed
even
to
his
old
hat
which
was
now
a
one
trimmed
with
gold
lace
to
match
the
coat
the
stick
also
such
as
workmen
carry
partly
for
walking
and
partly
for
and
which
he
had
been
holding
in
his
hand
a
minute
before
had
now
given
place
to
a
light
whip
with
which
he
gave
a
cut
through
the
air
listening
with
a
sense
of
aristocratic
pleasure
to
the
whistling
sound
it
made
and
finally
his
slender
figure
was
drawn
in
at
the
waist
by
a
belt
from
which
hung
a
thibault
was
pleased
beyond
measure
at
finding
himself
clothed
in
such
a
delightful
costume
and
with
a
feeling
of
vanity
natural
under
the
circumstances
he
was
overcome
with
the
desire
to
ascertain
without
delay
how
the
dress
suited
his
face
but
where
could
he
go
to
look
at
himself
out
there
in
the
midst
of
pitch
darkness
then
looking
about
him
he
saw
that
he
was
only
a
stone
s
throw
from
his
own
hut
ah
to
be
sure
he
said
nothing
easier
for
i
have
my
glass
and
he
made
haste
towards
his
hut
intending
like
narcissus
to
enjoy
his
own
beauty
in
peace
and
all
to
himself
but
the
door
of
the
hut
was
locked
and
thibault
felt
vainly
for
the
key
all
he
could
find
in
his
pockets
was
a
purse
a
box
containing
scented
lozenges
and
a
little
and
gold
penknife
what
could
he
have
done
then
with
his
then
suddenly
a
bright
thought
occurred
to
him
possibly
the
key
was
in
the
pocket
of
that
other
thibault
who
was
lying
out
there
in
the
road
he
went
back
and
felt
in
the
breeches
pocket
where
he
discovered
the
key
at
once
in
company
with
a
few
sous
holding
the
rough
clumsy
thing
in
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
returned
to
open
the
door
the
inside
of
the
hut
was
even
illustration
the
baron
s
horse
shied
throwing
the
rider
over
its
head
darker
that
the
night
outside
and
thibault
groped
about
to
find
the
steel
the
tinder
and
flint
and
the
matches
and
then
proceeded
to
try
and
light
the
candle
which
consisted
of
an
end
stuck
into
an
empty
bottle
in
a
second
or
two
this
was
accomplished
but
in
the
course
of
the
operation
thibault
was
obliged
to
take
hold
of
the
candle
with
his
fingers
pah
he
said
what
pigs
these
peasants
are
i
wonder
how
they
live
in
this
dirty
sort
of
way
however
the
candle
was
alight
which
was
the
chief
matter
and
thibault
now
took
down
his
mirror
and
bringing
it
to
the
light
looked
at
himself
in
it
his
eye
had
scarcely
caught
sight
of
the
reflected
image
than
he
uttered
a
cry
of
astonishment
it
was
no
longer
himself
that
he
saw
or
rather
although
it
was
still
thibault
in
spirit
it
was
no
longer
thibault
in
body
his
spirit
had
entered
into
the
body
of
a
handsome
young
man
of
or
years
of
age
with
blue
eyes
pink
fresh
cheeks
red
lips
and
white
teeth
in
short
it
had
entered
into
the
body
of
the
baron
raoul
de
vauparfond
then
thibault
the
wish
that
he
had
uttered
in
his
moment
of
anger
after
the
blow
from
the
whip
and
his
collision
with
the
horse
his
wish
had
been
that
for
four
and
twenty
hours
he
might
be
the
baron
de
vauparfond
and
the
baron
de
vauparfond
be
thibault
which
now
explained
to
him
what
had
at
first
seemed
inexplicable
why
the
unconscious
man
now
lying
in
the
road
was
dressed
in
his
clothes
and
had
his
face
but
i
must
not
forget
one
thing
he
said
that
is
that
although
i
seem
to
be
here
i
am
not
really
here
but
lying
out
there
so
i
must
be
careful
to
see
that
during
the
hours
during
which
i
shall
be
imprudent
enough
to
be
away
from
myself
no
irreparable
harm
comes
to
me
come
now
monsieur
de
vauparfond
do
not
be
so
fastidious
carry
the
poor
man
in
and
lay
him
gently
on
his
bed
and
although
with
his
aristocratic
instincts
monsieur
de
vauparfond
found
the
task
very
repugnant
to
him
thibault
nevertheless
courageously
took
up
his
own
body
in
his
arms
and
carried
himself
from
the
road
to
the
bed
having
thus
placed
the
body
in
safety
he
blew
out
the
light
for
fear
that
any
harm
should
come
to
this
other
self
before
he
came
to
then
carefully
locking
the
door
he
hid
the
key
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
where
he
was
in
the
habit
of
leaving
it
when
not
wishing
to
take
it
with
him
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
get
hold
of
the
horse
s
bridle
and
mount
into
the
saddle
once
there
thibault
had
a
preliminary
moment
of
some
uneasiness
for
having
travelled
more
on
foot
than
on
horseback
he
was
not
an
accomplished
rider
and
he
naturally
feared
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
keep
his
seat
when
the
horse
began
to
move
but
it
seemed
that
while
inheriting
raoul
s
body
he
also
inherited
his
physical
qualities
for
the
horse
being
an
intelligent
beast
and
perfectly
conscious
of
the
momentary
want
of
assurance
on
the
part
of
his
rider
made
an
effort
to
throw
him
whereupon
thibault
instinctively
gathered
up
the
reins
pressed
his
knees
against
the
horse
s
sides
dug
his
spurs
into
them
and
gave
the
animal
two
or
three
cuts
of
the
whip
which
brought
it
to
order
on
the
spot
thibault
perfectly
unknown
to
himself
was
a
past
master
in
horsemanship
this
little
affair
with
the
horse
enabled
thibault
more
fully
to
realise
his
duality
as
far
as
the
body
was
concerned
he
was
the
baron
raoul
de
vauparfond
from
top
to
toe
but
as
far
as
the
spirit
was
concerned
he
was
still
thibault
it
was
therefore
certain
that
the
spirit
of
the
young
lord
who
had
lent
him
his
body
was
now
sleeping
in
the
form
of
the
unconscious
thibault
which
he
had
left
behind
in
the
hut
the
division
of
substance
and
spirit
between
himself
and
the
baron
however
left
him
with
a
very
vague
idea
of
what
he
was
going
or
would
have
to
do
that
he
was
going
to
in
answer
to
the
countess
s
letter
so
much
he
knew
but
what
was
in
the
letter
at
what
hour
was
he
expected
how
was
he
to
gain
admission
to
the
castle
not
one
of
these
questions
could
he
answer
and
it
only
remained
for
him
to
discover
what
to
do
step
by
step
as
he
proceeded
suddenly
it
flashed
across
him
that
probably
the
countess
s
letter
was
somewhere
on
his
person
he
felt
about
his
dress
and
sure
enough
inside
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
was
something
which
by
its
shape
seemed
to
be
the
article
he
wanted
he
stopped
his
horse
and
putting
his
hand
into
his
pocket
drew
out
a
little
scented
leather
case
lined
with
white
satin
in
one
side
of
the
case
were
several
letters
in
the
other
only
one
no
doubt
the
latter
would
tell
him
what
he
wanted
to
know
if
he
could
once
get
to
read
it
he
was
now
only
a
short
distance
from
the
village
of
fleury
and
he
galloped
on
hoping
that
he
might
find
a
house
still
lighted
up
but
villagers
go
to
bed
early
in
those
days
even
earlier
than
they
do
now
and
thibault
went
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
without
seeing
a
single
light
at
last
thinking
he
heard
some
kind
of
movement
in
the
stables
of
an
inn
he
called
a
stable
boy
sallied
out
with
a
lantern
and
thibault
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
he
was
a
lord
said
friend
could
you
show
me
a
light
for
a
moment
you
would
be
doing
me
a
and
that
s
what
you
go
and
call
a
chap
out
of
bed
for
answered
the
rudely
well
you
are
a
nice
sort
of
young
un
you
are
and
turning
his
back
on
thibault
he
was
just
going
to
the
stable
when
thibault
perceiving
that
he
had
gone
on
a
wrong
tack
now
raised
his
voice
calling
out
look
here
sirrah
bring
your
lantern
here
and
give
me
a
light
or
i
ll
lay
my
whip
across
your
back
ah
pardon
my
lord
said
the
i
did
not
see
who
it
was
i
was
speaking
and
he
immediately
stood
on
holding
the
lantern
up
as
thibault
directed
him
thibault
unfolded
the
letter
and
read
my
dear
raoul
the
goddess
venus
has
certainly
taken
us
under
her
protection
a
grand
hunt
of
some
kind
is
to
take
place
out
in
the
direction
of
thury
i
know
no
particulars
about
it
all
i
do
know
is
that
is
going
away
this
evening
you
therefore
start
at
nine
o
clock
so
as
to
be
here
at
ten
come
in
by
the
way

know
someone
whom
you
know
will
be
awaiting
you
and
will
bring
you
you
know
where
last
time
you
came
i
don
t
mean
to
upbraid
you
but
it
did
seem
to
me
you
stayed
a
long
time
in
the
corridors
devil
take
it
muttered
thibault
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lord
said
the
nothing
you
lout
except
that
i
do
not
require
you
any
longer
and
you
can
a
good
journey
to
you
my
lord
said
the
bowing
to
the
ground
and
he
went
back
to
his
stable
devil
take
it
repeated
thibault
the
letter
gives
me
precious
little
information
except
that
we
are
under
the
protection
of
the
goddess
venus
that
goes
away
this
evening
that
the
comtesse
de
expects
me
at
ten
and
that
her
christian
name
is
jane
as
for
the
rest
i
am
to
go
in
by
way
i
i
shall
be
awaited
by
i
and
taken
i
thibault
scratched
his
ear
which
is
what
everybody
does
in
every
country
of
the
world
when
plunged
into
awkward
circumstances
he
longed
to
go
and
wake
up
the
lord
of
vauparfond
s
spirit
which
was
just
now
sleeping
in
thibault
s
body
on
thibault
s
bed
but
apart
from
the
loss
of
time
which
this
would
involve
it
might
also
cause
considerable
inconvenience
for
the
baron
s
spirit
on
seeing
its
own
body
so
near
to
it
might
be
taken
with
the
desire
of
it
this
would
give
rise
to
a
struggle
in
which
thibault
could
not
well
defend
himself
without
doing
serious
harm
to
his
own
person
some
other
way
out
of
the
difficulty
must
therefore
be
found
he
had
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
wonderful
sagacity
of
animals
and
had
himself
during
his
life
in
the
country
had
occasion
more
than
once
to
admire
their
instinct
and
he
now
determined
to
trust
to
that
of
his
horse
riding
back
into
the
main
road
he
turned
the
horse
in
the
direction
of
and
let
it
have
its
head
the
horse
immediately
started
off
at
a
gallop
it
had
evidently
understood
thibault
troubled
himself
no
further
it
was
now
the
horse
s
affair
to
bring
him
safely
to
his
destination
on
reaching
the
corner
of
the
park
wall
the
animal
stopped
not
apparently
because
it
was
in
doubt
as
to
which
road
to
take
but
something
seemed
to
make
it
uneasy
and
it
pricked
its
ears
at
the
same
time
thibault
also
fancied
that
he
caught
sight
of
two
shadows
but
they
must
have
been
only
shadows
for
although
he
stood
up
in
his
stirrups
and
looked
all
around
him
he
could
see
absolutely
nothing
they
were
probably
poachers
he
thought
who
had
reasons
like
himself
for
wishing
to
get
inside
the
park
there
being
no
longer
anything
to
bar
his
passage
he
had
only
as
before
to
let
the
horse
go
its
own
way
and
he
accordingly
did
so
the
horse
followed
the
walls
of
the
park
at
a
quick
trot
carefully
choosing
the
soft
edge
of
the
road
and
not
uttering
a
single
neigh
the
intelligent
animal
seemed
as
if
it
knew
that
it
must
make
no
sound
or
at
least
as
little
sound
as
possible
in
this
way
they
went
along
the
whole
of
one
side
of
the
park
and
on
reaching
the
corner
the
horse
turned
as
the
wall
turned
and
stopped
before
a
small
breach
in
the
same
it
s
through
here
evidently
said
thibault
that
we
have
to
the
horse
answered
by
sniffing
at
the
breach
and
scraping
the
ground
with
its
foot
thibault
gave
the
animal
the
rein
and
it
managed
to
climb
up
and
through
the
breach
over
the
loose
stones
which
rolled
away
beneath
its
hoof
horse
and
rider
were
now
within
the
park
one
of
the
three
difficulties
had
been
successfully
overcome
thibault
had
got
in
by
the
he
it
now
remained
to
find
the
person
he
and
he
thought
it
wisest
to
leave
this
also
to
his
horse
the
horse
went
on
for
another
five
minutes
and
then
stopped
at
a
short
distance
from
the
castle
before
the
door
of
one
of
those
little
huts
of
rough
logs
and
bark
and
clay
which
are
built
up
in
parks
as
painters
introduce
buildings
into
their
landscapes
solely
for
the
sake
of
ornament
on
hearing
the
horse
s
hoofs
someone
partly
opened
the
door
and
the
horse
stopped
in
front
of
it
a
pretty
girl
came
out
and
asked
in
a
low
voice
is
it
you
monsieur
raoul
yes
my
child
it
is
i
answered
thibault
dismounting
madame
was
terribly
afraid
that
drunken
fool
of
a
champagne
might
not
have
given
you
the
she
need
not
have
been
afraid
champagne
brought
it
me
with
the
most
exemplary
leave
your
horse
then
and
but
who
will
look
after
it
why
cramoisi
of
course
the
man
who
always
ah
yes
to
be
sure
said
thibault
as
if
these
details
were
familiar
to
him
cramoisi
will
look
after
come
come
said
the
maid
we
must
make
haste
or
madame
will
complain
again
that
we
loiter
in
the
and
as
she
spoke
these
words
which
recalled
a
phrase
in
the
letter
which
had
been
written
to
raoul
she
laughed
and
showed
a
row
of
pearly
white
teeth
and
thibault
felt
that
he
should
like
to
loiter
in
the
park
before
waiting
to
get
into
the
corridors
then
the
maid
suddenly
stood
still
a
moment
with
her
head
bent
listening
what
is
it
asked
thibault
i
thought
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
branch
creaking
under
somebody
s
very
likely
said
thibault
no
doubt
cramoisi
s
all
the
more
reason
that
you
should
be
careful
what
you
do
at
all
events
out
i
don
t
do
you
not
know
that
cramoisi
is
the
man
i
am
engaged
to
ah
to
be
sure
but
when
i
am
alone
with
you
my
dear
rose
i
always
forget
i
am
called
rose
now
am
i
i
never
knew
such
a
forgetful
man
as
you
are
monsieur
i
call
you
rose
my
pretty
one
because
the
rose
is
the
queen
of
flowers
as
you
are
the
queen
of
in
good
truth
my
lord
said
the
maid
i
have
always
found
you
a
lively
witty
gentleman
but
you
surpass
yourself
this
thibault
drew
himself
up
flattered
by
this
remark
really
a
letter
addressed
to
the
baron
but
which
it
had
fallen
to
the
to
unseal
let
us
hope
your
mistress
will
think
the
same
he
said
as
to
that
said
the
waiting
maid
any
man
can
make
one
of
these
ladies
of
fashion
think
him
the
cleverest
and
wittiest
in
the
world
simply
by
holding
his
thank
you
he
said
i
will
remember
what
you
hush
said
the
woman
to
thibault
there
is
madame
behind
the
curtains
follow
me
now
for
they
had
now
to
cross
an
open
space
that
lay
between
the
wooded
part
of
the
park
and
the
flight
of
steps
leading
up
to
the
castle
thibault
began
walking
towards
the
latter
now
now
said
the
maid
catching
hold
of
him
by
the
arm
what
are
you
doing
you
foolish
man
what
am
i
doing
well
i
confess
suzette
i
don
t
know
in
the
least
what
i
doing
suzette
so
that
s
my
name
now
is
it
i
think
monsieur
does
me
the
honour
of
calling
me
in
turn
by
the
name
of
all
his
mistresses
but
come
this
way
you
are
not
dreaming
i
suppose
of
going
through
the
great
reception
rooms
that
would
give
a
fine
opportunity
to
my
lord
the
count
truly
and
the
maid
hurried
thibault
towards
a
little
door
to
the
right
of
which
was
a
spiral
staircase
up
thibault
put
his
arm
round
his
companion
s
waist
which
was
as
slender
and
supple
as
a
snake
i
think
we
must
be
in
the
corridors
now
eh
he
asked
trying
to
kiss
the
young
woman
s
pretty
cheek
no
not
yet
she
answered
but
never
mind
by
my
faith
he
said
if
my
name
this
evening
were
thibault
instead
of
raoul
i
would
carry
you
up
with
me
to
the
garrets
instead
of
stopping
on
the
first
floor
at
that
moment
a
door
was
heard
grating
on
its
hinges
quick
quick
monsieur
said
the
maid
madame
is
growing
and
drawing
thibault
after
her
she
ran
up
the
remaining
stairs
to
the
corridor
opened
a
door
pushed
thibault
into
a
room
and
shut
the
door
after
him
firmly
believing
that
it
was
the
baron
raoul
de
vauparfond
or
as
she
herself
called
him
the
most
forgetful
man
in
the
world
whom
she
had
thus
secured
chapter
xvii
the
baron
de
thibault
found
himself
in
the
countess
s
room
if
the
magnificence
of
bailiff
magloire
s
furniture
rescued
from
the
of
his
highness
the
duke
of
orleans
had
astonished
thibault
the
daintiness
the
harmony
the
taste
of
the
countess
s
room
filled
him
with
intoxicating
delight
the
rough
child
of
the
forest
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
even
in
dreams
for
one
can
not
even
dream
of
things
of
which
we
have
no
idea
double
curtains
were
drawn
across
the
two
windows
the
one
set
of
white
silk
trimmed
with
lace
the
other
of
pale
china
blue
satin
embroidered
with
silver
flowers
the
bed
and
the
toilet
table
were
draped
to
match
the
windows
and
were
nearly
smothered
in
clouds
of
valenciennes
lace
the
walls
were
hung
with
very
light
silk
over
which
thick
folds
of
indian
muslin
delicate
as
woven
air
undulated
like
waves
of
mist
at
the
slightest
breath
of
air
from
the
door
the
ceiling
was
composed
of
a
medallion
painted
by
boucher
and
representing
the
toilet
of
venus
she
was
handing
her
cupids
the
various
articles
of
a
woman
s
apparel
and
these
were
now
all
distributed
with
the
exception
of
the
goddess
s
girdle
the
central
medallion
was
surrounded
by
a
series
of
panels
on
which
were
painted
supposed
views
of
cnidos
paphos
and
amathus
all
the
furniture
chairs
armchairs
settees
sociables
was
covered
with
china
satin
similar
to
that
of
the
curtains
over
the
groundwork
of
the
carpet
of
the
colour
of
pale
green
water
were
scattered
bouquets
of
blue
pink
poppies
and
white
daisies
the
tables
were
of
the
of
indian
lacquer
and
the
whole
room
was
softly
lighted
by
pink
wax
candles
held
in
two
candelabra
a
vague
and
indescribably
delicate
perfume
pervaded
the
air
one
could
not
say
from
what
sweet
essence
for
it
was
scarcely
even
a
perfume
but
rather
an
emanation
the
same
kind
of
odorous
exhalation
whereby
æneas
in
the
æneid
recognised
the
presence
of
his
mother
thibault
pushed
into
the
room
by
the
made
one
step
forward
and
then
stopped
he
had
taken
everything
in
at
a
glance
inhaled
everything
at
a
breath
for
a
second
there
passed
before
his
mind
s
eye
like
a
vision
agnelette
s
little
cottage
madame
polet
s
the
of
the
bailiff
s
wife
but
they
disappeared
as
quickly
to
give
place
to
this
delicious
paradise
of
love
into
which
he
had
been
transported
as
by
magic
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
what
he
looked
upon
was
real
were
there
really
men
and
women
in
the
world
so
blessed
by
fortune
as
to
live
in
such
surroundings
as
these
had
he
not
been
carried
to
some
wizard
s
castle
to
some
fairy
s
palace
and
those
who
enjoyed
such
favour
as
this
what
special
good
had
they
done
what
special
evil
had
they
done
who
were
deprived
of
these
advantages
why
instead
of
wishing
to
be
the
baron
for
four
and
twenty
hours
had
he
not
wished
to
be
the
countess
s
all
his
life
how
would
he
bear
to
be
thibault
again
after
having
seen
all
this
he
had
just
reached
this
point
in
his
reflections
when
the
door
opened
and
the
countess
herself
appeared
a
fit
bird
for
such
a
nest
a
fit
flower
for
such
a
sweet
scented
garden
her
hair
fastened
only
by
four
diamond
pins
hung
down
loosely
to
one
side
while
the
rest
was
gathered
into
one
large
curl
that
hung
over
the
other
shoulder
and
fell
into
her
bosom
the
graceful
lines
of
her
lithe
and
figure
no
longer
hidden
by
puffings
of
dress
were
clearly
indicated
beneath
her
loose
pink
silk
gown
richly
covered
with
lace
so
fine
and
transparent
was
the
silk
of
her
stockings
that
it
was
more
like
flesh
than
any
texture
and
her
tiny
feet
were
shod
in
little
slippers
made
of
cloth
of
silver
with
red
heels
but
not
an
atom
of
jewellery
no
bracelets
on
the
arms
no
rings
on
the
fingers
just
one
row
of
pearls
round
the
throat
that
was
all
but
what
pearls
worth
a
king
s
ransom
as
this
radiant
apparition
came
towards
him
thibault
fell
on
his
knees
he
bowed
himself
feeling
crushed
at
the
sight
of
this
luxury
of
this
beauty
which
to
him
seemed
inseparable
yes
yes
you
may
well
kneel
kneel
lower
lower
yet
kiss
my
feet
kiss
the
carpet
kiss
the
floor
but
i
shall
not
any
the
more
forgive
you
you
are
a
monster
in
truth
madame
if
i
compare
myself
with
you
i
am
even
worse
than
that
ah
yes
pretend
that
you
mistake
my
words
and
think
i
am
only
speaking
of
your
outward
appearance
when
you
know
i
am
speaking
of
your
behaviour
and
indeed
if
your
perfidious
soul
were
imaged
in
your
face
you
would
verily
and
indeed
be
a
monster
of
ugliness
but
yet
it
is
not
so
for
monsieur
for
all
his
wickedness
and
infamous
doings
still
remains
the
handsomest
gentleman
in
all
the
country
round
but
come
now
monsieur
ought
you
not
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
because
i
am
the
handsomest
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
asked
thibault
detecting
by
the
tone
of
the
lady
s
voice
that
his
crime
was
not
an
irremediable
one
no
monsieur
but
for
having
the
blackest
soul
and
the
falsest
heart
ever
hidden
beneath
such
a
gay
and
golden
exterior
now
get
up
and
come
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
to
and
the
countess
so
speaking
held
out
a
hand
to
thibault
which
offered
pardon
at
the
same
time
that
it
demanded
a
kiss
thibault
took
the
soft
sweet
hand
in
his
own
and
kissed
it
never
had
his
lips
touched
anything
so
like
satin
the
countess
now
seated
herself
on
the
settee
and
made
a
sign
to
raoul
to
sit
down
beside
her
let
me
know
something
of
your
doings
since
you
were
last
here
said
the
countess
to
him
first
tell
me
dear
countess
replied
thibault
when
i
last
was
do
you
mean
you
have
forgotten
one
does
not
generally
acknowledge
things
of
that
kind
unless
seeking
for
a
cause
of
on
the
contrary
dear
friend
it
is
because
the
recollection
of
that
last
visit
is
so
present
with
me
that
i
think
it
must
have
been
only
yesterday
we
were
together
and
i
try
in
vain
to
recall
what
i
have
done
and
i
assure
you
i
have
committed
no
other
crime
since
yesterday
but
that
of
loving
that
s
not
a
bad
speech
but
you
will
not
get
yourself
out
of
disgrace
by
paying
dear
countess
said
thibault
supposing
we
put
off
explanations
to
another
no
you
must
answer
me
now
it
is
five
days
since
i
last
saw
you
what
have
you
been
doing
all
that
time
i
am
waiting
for
you
to
tell
me
countess
how
can
you
expect
me
conscious
as
i
am
of
my
innocence
to
accuse
myself
very
well
then
i
will
not
begin
by
saying
anything
about
your
loitering
in
the
oh
pray
let
us
speak
of
it
how
can
you
think
countess
that
knowing
you
the
diamond
of
diamonds
was
waiting
for
me
i
should
stop
to
pick
up
an
imitation
pearl
ah
but
i
know
how
fickle
men
are
and
lisette
is
such
a
pretty
girl
not
so
dear
jane
but
you
must
understand
that
she
being
our
confidante
and
knowing
all
our
secrets
i
can
not
treat
her
quite
like
a
how
agreeable
it
must
be
to
be
able
to
say
to
one
i
am
deceiving
the
comtesse
de
and
i
am
the
rival
of
monsieur
cramoisi
very
well
then
there
shall
be
no
more
loiterings
in
the
corridors
no
more
kisses
for
poor
lisette
supposing
of
course
there
ever
have
been
any
well
after
all
there
is
no
great
harm
in
do
you
mean
that
i
have
done
something
even
worse
where
had
you
been
the
other
night
when
you
were
met
on
the
road
between
erneville
and
someone
met
me
on
the
road
yes
on
the
erneville
road
where
were
you
coming
from
i
was
coming
home
from
fishing
what
fishing
they
had
been
drawing
the
berval
oh
we
know
all
about
that
you
are
such
a
fine
fisher
are
you
not
monsieur
and
what
sort
of
an
eel
were
you
bringing
back
in
your
net
returning
from
your
fishing
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
had
been
dining
with
my
friend
the
baron
at
at
vez
ha
i
fancy
you
went
there
mainly
to
console
the
beautiful
recluse
whom
the
jealous
baron
keeps
shut
up
there
a
regular
prisoner
so
they
say
but
even
that
i
can
forgive
what
is
there
a
blacker
crime
still
said
thibault
who
was
beginning
to
feel
quite
reassured
seeing
how
quickly
the
pardon
followed
on
the
accusation
however
serious
it
appeared
at
first
yes
at
the
ball
given
by
his
highness
the
duke
of
what
ball
why
the
one
yesterday
it
s
not
so
very
along
ago
is
it
oh
yesterday
s
ball
i
was
admiring
indeed
but
i
was
not
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
be
present
jane
for
me
to
admire
you
can
not
one
admire
you
in
remembrance
as
truly
as
in
person
and
if
when
absent
you
triumph
by
comparison
the
victory
is
only
so
much
the
i
daresay
and
it
was
in
order
to
carry
out
the
comparison
to
its
utmost
limits
that
you
danced
four
times
with
madame
de
bonneuil
they
are
very
pretty
are
they
not
those
dark
women
who
cover
themselves
with
rouge
and
have
eyebrows
like
the
chinese
mannikins
on
my
screens
and
moustaches
like
a
do
you
know
what
we
talked
about
during
those
four
it
is
true
then
that
you
danced
four
times
with
her
it
is
true
no
doubt
since
you
say
is
that
a
proper
sort
of
answer
what
other
could
i
give
could
anyone
contradict
what
was
said
by
so
pretty
a
mouth
not
i
certainly
who
would
still
bless
it
even
though
it
were
pronouncing
my
sentence
of
and
as
if
to
await
this
sentence
thibault
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
countess
but
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
lisette
rushed
in
full
of
alarm
ah
monsieur
monsieur
she
cried
save
yourself
here
comes
my
master
the
count
the
count
exclaimed
the
countess
yes
the
count
in
person
and
his
huntsman
lestocq
with
impossible
i
assure
you
madame
cramoisi
saw
them
as
plain
as
i
see
you
the
poor
fellow
was
quite
pale
with
ah
then
the
meet
at
thury
was
all
a
pretence
a
trap
to
catch
me
who
can
tell
madame
alas
alas
men
are
such
deceiving
creatures
what
is
to
be
done
asked
the
countess
wait
for
the
count
and
kill
him
said
thibault
resolutely
furious
at
again
seeing
his
good
fortune
escaping
from
him
at
losing
what
above
all
things
it
had
been
his
ambition
to
possess
kill
him
kill
the
count
are
you
mad
raoul
no
no
you
must
fly
you
must
save
yourself
lisette
lisette
take
the
baron
through
my
and
in
spite
of
his
resistance
lisette
by
dint
of
pushing
got
him
safely
away
only
just
in
time
steps
were
heard
coming
up
the
wide
main
staircase
the
countess
with
a
last
word
of
love
to
the
supposed
raoul
glided
quickly
into
her
bedroom
while
thibault
followed
lisette
she
led
him
rapidly
along
the
corridor
where
cramoisi
was
keeping
guard
at
the
other
end
then
into
a
room
and
through
this
into
another
and
finally
into
a
smaller
one
which
led
into
a
little
tower
here
the
fugitives
came
again
on
to
a
staircase
corresponding
with
the
one
by
which
they
had
gone
up
but
when
they
reached
the
bottom
they
found
the
door
locked
lisette
with
thibault
still
following
went
back
up
a
few
steps
into
a
sort
of
office
in
which
was
a
window
looking
over
the
garden
this
she
opened
it
was
only
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
and
thibault
jumped
out
landing
safely
below
you
know
where
your
horse
is
called
lisette
jump
on
its
back
and
do
not
stop
till
you
get
to
thibault
would
have
liked
to
thank
her
for
all
her
kindly
warnings
but
she
was
some
six
feet
above
him
and
he
had
no
time
to
lose
a
stride
or
two
brought
him
to
the
clump
of
trees
under
which
stood
the
little
building
which
served
as
stable
for
his
horse
but
was
the
horse
still
there
he
heard
a
neigh
which
reassured
him
only
the
neigh
sounded
he
thought
more
like
a
cry
of
pain
thibault
went
in
put
out
his
hand
felt
the
horse
gathered
up
the
reins
and
leaped
on
to
its
back
without
touching
the
stirrups
thibault
as
we
have
already
said
had
suddenly
become
a
consummate
horseman
but
the
horse
no
sooner
felt
the
weight
of
the
rider
on
its
back
than
the
poor
beast
began
to
totter
on
its
legs
thibault
dug
his
spurs
in
savagely
and
the
horse
made
a
frantic
effort
to
stand
but
in
another
instant
uttering
one
of
those
pitiful
neighs
which
thibault
had
heard
when
he
approached
the
stable
it
rolled
helplessly
over
on
its
side
thibault
quickly
disengaged
his
leg
from
under
the
animal
which
as
the
poor
thing
struggled
to
rise
he
had
no
difficulty
in
doing
and
he
found
himself
again
on
his
feet
then
it
became
clear
to
him
that
in
order
to
prevent
his
escape
monsieur
le
comte
de
had
hamstrung
his
horse
thibault
uttered
an
oath
if
i
ever
meet
you
monsieur
comte
de
he
said
i
swear
that
i
will
hamstring
you
as
you
have
hamstrung
this
poor
beast
then
he
rushed
out
of
the
little
building
and
remembering
the
way
he
had
come
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
breach
in
the
wall
and
walking
quickly
towards
it
found
it
climbed
over
the
stones
and
was
again
outside
the
park
but
his
further
passage
was
barred
for
there
in
front
of
him
was
the
figure
of
a
man
who
stood
waiting
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
thibault
recognised
the
comte
de
the
comte
de
thought
he
recognised
raoul
de
vauparfond
draw
baron
said
the
count
further
explanation
was
unnecessary
thibault
on
his
side
equally
enraged
at
having
the
prey
on
which
he
had
already
set
tooth
and
claw
snatched
away
from
him
was
as
ready
to
fight
as
the
count
he
drew
not
his
sword
but
his
and
the
two
men
crossed
weapons
thibault
who
was
something
of
an
adept
at
had
no
idea
of
fencing
what
was
his
surprise
therefore
when
he
found
that
he
knew
by
instinct
how
to
handle
his
weapon
and
could
parry
and
thrust
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
art
he
parried
the
first
two
or
three
of
the
count
s
blows
with
admirable
skill
ah
i
heard
i
remember
muttered
the
count
between
his
clenched
teeth
that
at
the
last
match
you
rivalled
himself
at
the
thibault
had
no
conception
who
might
be
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
strength
and
elasticity
of
wrist
thanks
to
which
he
felt
he
might
have
rivalled
the
devil
himself
so
far
he
had
only
been
on
the
defensive
but
the
count
having
aimed
one
or
two
unsuccessful
lunges
at
him
he
saw
his
opportunity
struck
out
and
sent
his
knife
clean
through
his
adversary
s
shoulder
the
count
dropped
his
sword
tottered
and
falling
on
to
one
knee
cried
help
lestocq
thibault
ought
then
to
have
sheathed
his
knife
and
fled
but
unfortunately
he
remembered
the
oath
he
had
taken
as
regards
the
count
when
he
had
found
that
his
horse
had
been
hamstrung
he
slipped
the
sharp
blade
of
his
weapon
under
the
bent
knee
and
drew
it
towards
him
the
count
uttered
a
cry
but
as
thibault
rose
from
his
stooping
posture
he
too
felt
a
sharp
pain
between
his
followed
by
a
sensation
as
of
extreme
cold
over
the
chest
and
finally
the
point
of
a
weapon
appeared
above
his
right
breast
then
he
saw
a
cloud
of
blood
and
knew
no
more
lestocq
called
to
his
master
s
aid
as
the
latter
fell
had
run
to
the
spot
and
as
thibault
rose
from
hamstringing
the
count
had
seized
that
moment
to
dig
his
hunting
knife
into
his
back
chapter
xviii
death
and
resurrection
the
cold
morning
air
brought
thibault
back
to
consciousness
he
tried
to
rise
but
the
extremity
of
his
pain
held
him
bound
he
was
lying
on
his
back
with
no
remembrance
of
what
had
happened
seeing
only
the
low
grey
sky
above
him
he
made
another
effort
and
turning
managed
to
lift
himself
on
his
elbow
as
he
looked
around
him
he
began
to
recall
the
events
of
the
previous
night
he
recognised
the
breach
in
the
wall
and
then
there
came
back
to
him
the
memory
of
the
love
meeting
with
the
countess
and
the
desperate
duel
with
the
count
the
ground
near
him
was
red
with
blood
but
the
count
was
no
longer
there
no
doubt
lestocq
who
had
given
him
this
fine
blow
that
was
nailing
him
to
the
spot
had
helped
his
master
indoors
thibault
they
had
left
there
to
die
like
a
dog
as
far
as
they
cared
he
had
it
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
hurl
after
them
all
the
maledictory
wishes
wherewith
one
would
like
to
assail
one
s
cruellest
enemy
but
since
thibault
had
been
no
longer
thibault
and
indeed
during
the
remainder
of
the
time
that
he
would
still
be
the
baron
raoul
or
at
least
so
in
outward
appearance
his
demoniacal
power
had
been
and
would
continue
in
abeyance
he
had
until
nine
o
clock
that
evening
but
would
he
live
till
then
this
question
gave
rise
in
thibault
to
a
very
uneasy
state
of
mind
if
he
were
to
die
before
that
hour
which
of
them
would
die
he
or
the
baron
it
seemed
to
him
as
likely
to
be
one
as
the
other
what
however
disturbed
and
angered
him
most
was
his
consciousness
that
the
misfortune
which
had
befallen
him
was
again
owing
to
his
own
fault
he
remembered
now
that
before
he
had
expressed
the
wish
to
be
the
baron
for
four
and
twenty
hours
he
had
said
some
such
words
as
these
i
should
laugh
raoul
if
the
comte
de
were
to
take
you
by
surprise
you
would
not
get
off
so
easily
as
if
he
were
the
bailiff
magloire
there
would
be
swords
drawn
and
blows
given
and
at
last
with
a
terrible
effort
and
suffering
the
while
excruciating
pain
thibault
succeeded
in
dragging
himself
on
to
one
knee
he
could
then
make
out
people
walking
along
a
road
not
far
off
on
their
way
to
market
and
he
tried
to
call
to
them
but
the
blood
filled
his
mouth
and
nearly
choked
him
so
he
put
his
hat
on
the
point
of
his
knife
and
signalled
to
them
like
a
shipwrecked
mariner
but
his
strength
again
failing
he
once
more
fell
back
unconscious
in
a
little
while
however
he
again
awoke
to
sensation
he
appeared
to
be
swaying
from
side
to
side
as
if
in
a
boat
he
opened
his
eyes
the
peasants
it
seemed
had
seen
him
and
although
not
knowing
who
he
was
had
had
compassion
on
this
handsome
young
man
lying
covered
with
blood
and
had
concocted
a
sort
of
out
of
some
branches
on
which
they
were
now
carrying
him
to
but
by
the
time
they
reached
puiseux
the
wounded
man
felt
that
he
could
no
longer
bear
the
movement
and
begged
them
to
put
him
down
in
the
first
peasant
s
hut
they
came
to
and
to
send
a
doctor
to
him
there
the
carriers
took
him
to
the
house
of
the
village
priest
and
left
him
there
thibault
before
they
parted
distributing
gold
among
them
from
raoul
s
purse
accompanied
by
many
thanks
for
all
their
kind
offices
the
priest
was
away
saying
mass
but
on
returning
and
finding
the
wounded
man
he
uttered
loud
cries
of
lamentation
had
he
been
raoul
himself
thibault
could
not
have
found
a
better
hospital
the
priest
had
at
one
time
been
curé
of
vauparfond
and
while
there
had
been
engaged
to
give
raoul
his
first
schooling
like
all
country
priests
he
knew
or
thought
he
knew
something
about
doctoring
so
he
examined
his
old
pupil
s
wound
the
knife
had
passed
under
the
through
the
right
lung
and
out
between
the
second
and
third
ribs
he
did
not
for
a
moment
disguise
to
himself
the
seriousness
of
the
wound
but
he
said
nothing
until
the
doctor
had
been
to
see
it
the
latter
arrived
and
after
his
examination
he
turned
and
shook
his
head
are
you
going
to
bleed
him
asked
the
priest
what
would
be
the
use
asked
the
doctor
if
it
had
been
done
at
once
after
the
wound
was
given
it
might
perhaps
have
helped
to
save
him
but
it
would
be
dangerous
now
to
disturb
the
blood
in
any
is
there
any
chance
for
him
asked
the
priest
who
was
thinking
that
the
less
there
was
for
the
doctor
to
do
the
more
there
would
be
for
the
priest
if
his
wound
runs
the
ordinary
course
said
the
doctor
lowering
his
voice
he
will
probably
not
last
out
the
you
give
him
up
then
a
doctor
never
gives
up
a
patient
or
at
least
if
he
does
so
he
still
trusts
to
the
possibility
of
nature
mercifully
interfering
on
the
patient
s
behalf
a
clot
may
form
and
stop
the
hemorrhage
a
cough
may
disturb
the
clot
and
the
patient
bleed
to
you
think
then
that
it
is
my
duty
to
prepare
the
poor
young
man
for
death
asked
the
curate
i
think
answered
the
doctor
shrugging
his
shoulders
you
would
do
better
to
leave
him
alone
in
the
first
place
because
he
is
at
present
in
a
drowsy
condition
and
can
not
hear
what
you
say
later
on
because
he
will
be
delirious
and
unable
to
understand
but
the
doctor
was
mistaken
the
wounded
man
drowsy
as
he
was
overheard
this
conversation
more
as
regards
the
salvation
of
his
soul
than
the
recovery
of
his
body
how
many
things
people
say
in
the
presence
of
sick
persons
believing
that
they
can
not
hear
while
all
the
while
they
are
taking
in
every
word
in
the
present
case
this
extra
acuteness
of
hearing
may
perhaps
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
thibault
s
soul
which
was
awake
in
raoul
s
body
if
the
soul
belonging
to
it
had
been
in
this
body
it
would
probably
have
succumbed
more
entirely
to
the
effects
of
the
wound
the
doctor
now
dressed
the
wound
in
the
back
but
left
the
front
wound
uncovered
merely
directing
that
a
piece
of
linen
soaked
in
iced
water
should
be
kept
over
it
then
having
poured
some
drops
of
a
sedative
into
a
glass
of
water
and
telling
the
priest
to
give
this
to
the
patient
whenever
he
asked
for
drink
the
doctor
departed
saying
that
he
would
come
again
the
following
morning
but
that
he
much
feared
he
should
take
his
journey
for
nothing
thibault
would
have
liked
to
put
in
a
word
of
his
own
and
to
say
himself
what
he
thought
about
his
condition
but
his
spirit
was
as
if
imprisoned
in
this
dying
body
and
against
his
will
was
forced
to
submit
to
lying
thus
within
its
cell
but
he
could
still
hear
the
priest
who
not
only
spoke
to
him
but
endeavoured
by
shaking
him
to
arouse
him
from
his
lethargy
thibault
found
this
very
fatiguing
and
it
was
lucky
for
the
priest
that
the
wounded
man
just
now
had
no
superhuman
power
for
he
inwardly
sent
the
good
man
to
the
devil
many
times
over
before
long
it
seemed
to
him
that
some
sort
of
hot
burning
pan
was
being
inserted
under
the
soles
of
his
feet
his
loins
his
head
his
blood
began
to
circulate
then
to
boil
like
water
over
a
fire
his
ideas
became
confused
his
clenched
jaws
opened
his
tongue
which
had
been
bound
became
loosened
some
disconnected
words
escaped
him
ah
ah
he
thought
to
himself
this
no
doubt
is
what
the
good
doctor
spoke
about
as
delirium
and
for
the
while
at
least
this
was
his
last
lucid
idea
his
whole
life
and
his
life
had
really
only
existed
since
his
first
acquaintance
with
the
black
wolf
passed
before
him
he
saw
himself
following
and
failing
to
hit
the
buck
saw
himself
tied
to
the
and
the
blows
of
the
strap
falling
on
him
saw
himself
and
the
black
wolf
drawing
up
their
compact
saw
himself
trying
to
pass
the
devil
s
ring
over
agnelette
s
finger
saw
himself
trying
to
pull
out
the
red
hairs
which
now
covered
a
third
of
his
head
then
he
saw
himself
on
his
way
to
pay
court
to
the
pretty
madame
polet
of
the
mill
meeting
landry
and
getting
rid
of
his
rival
pursued
by
the
farm
servants
and
followed
by
his
wolves
he
saw
himself
making
the
acquaintance
of
madame
magloire
hunting
for
her
eating
his
share
of
the
game
hiding
behind
the
curtains
discovered
by
maître
magloire
flouted
by
the
baron
of
vez
turned
out
by
all
three
again
he
saw
the
hollow
tree
with
his
wolves
couching
around
it
and
the
owls
perched
on
its
branches
and
heard
the
sounds
of
the
approaching
violins
and
hautboy
and
saw
himself
looking
as
agnelette
and
the
happy
wedding
party
went
by
he
saw
himself
the
victim
of
angry
jealousy
endeavouring
to
fight
against
it
by
the
help
of
drink
and
across
his
troubled
brain
came
the
recollection
of
françois
of
champagne
and
the
he
heard
the
galloping
of
baron
raoul
s
horse
and
he
felt
himself
knocked
down
and
rolling
in
the
muddy
road
then
he
ceased
to
see
himself
as
thibault
in
his
stead
arose
the
figure
of
the
handsome
young
rider
whose
form
he
had
taken
for
a
while
once
more
he
was
kissing
lisette
once
more
his
lips
were
touching
the
countess
s
hand
then
he
was
wanting
to
escape
but
he
found
himself
at
a
where
three
ways
only
met
and
each
of
these
was
guarded
by
one
of
his
victims
the
first
by
the
spectre
of
a
drowned
man
that
was
marcotte
the
second
by
a
young
man
dying
of
fever
on
a
hospital
bed
that
was
landry
the
third
by
a
wounded
man
dragging
himself
along
on
one
knee
and
trying
in
vain
to
stand
up
on
his
mutilated
leg
that
was
the
comte
de
he
fancied
that
as
all
these
things
passed
before
him
he
told
the
history
of
them
one
by
one
and
that
the
priest
as
he
listened
to
this
strange
confession
looked
more
like
a
dying
man
was
paler
and
more
trembling
than
the
man
whose
confession
he
was
listening
to
that
he
wanted
to
give
him
absolution
but
that
he
thibault
pushed
him
away
shaking
his
head
and
that
he
cried
out
with
a
terrible
laugh
i
want
no
absolution
i
am
damned
damned
damned
and
in
the
midst
of
all
this
hallucination
this
delirious
madness
the
spirit
of
thibault
could
hear
the
priest
s
clock
striking
the
hours
and
as
they
struck
he
counted
them
only
this
clock
seemed
to
have
grown
to
gigantic
proportions
and
the
face
of
it
was
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
and
the
numbers
on
it
were
flames
and
the
clock
was
called
eternity
and
the
monstrous
pendulum
as
it
swung
backwards
and
forwards
called
out
in
turn
at
every
beat
never
for
ever
and
so
he
lay
and
heard
the
long
hours
of
the
day
pass
one
by
one
and
then
at
last
the
clock
struck
nine
at
half
past
nine
he
thibault
would
have
been
raoul
and
raoul
would
have
been
thibault
for
just
four
and
twenty
hours
as
the
last
stroke
of
the
hour
died
away
thibault
felt
the
fever
passing
from
him
it
was
succeeded
by
a
sensation
of
coldness
which
almost
amounted
to
shivering
he
opened
his
eyes
all
trembling
with
cold
and
saw
the
priest
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
saying
the
prayers
for
the
dying
and
the
hands
of
the
actual
clock
pointing
to
a
quarter
past
nine
his
senses
had
become
so
acute
that
imperceptible
as
was
their
double
movement
he
could
yet
see
both
the
larger
and
smaller
one
slowly
creeping
along
they
were
gradually
nearing
the
critical
hour
half
past
nine
although
the
face
of
the
clock
was
in
darkness
it
seemed
illuminated
by
some
inward
light
as
the
minute
hand
approached
the
number
a
spasm
becoming
every
instant
more
and
more
violent
shook
the
dying
man
his
feet
were
like
ice
and
the
numbness
slowly
but
steadily
mounted
from
the
feet
to
the
knees
from
the
knees
to
the
thighs
from
the
thighs
to
the
lower
part
of
the
body
the
sweat
was
running
down
his
forehead
but
he
had
no
strength
to
wipe
it
away
nor
even
to
ask
to
have
it
done
it
was
a
sweat
of
agony
which
he
knew
every
moment
might
be
the
sweat
of
death
all
kinds
of
strange
shapes
which
had
nothing
of
the
human
about
them
floated
before
his
eyes
the
light
faded
away
wings
as
of
bats
seemed
to
lift
his
body
and
carry
it
into
some
twilight
region
which
was
neither
life
nor
death
but
seemed
a
part
of
both
then
the
twilight
itself
grew
darker
and
darker
his
eyes
closed
and
like
a
blind
man
stumbling
in
the
dark
his
heavy
wings
seemed
to
flap
against
strange
and
unknown
things
after
that
he
sank
away
into
unfathomable
depths
into
bottomless
abysses
but
still
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
bell
the
bell
rang
once
and
scarcely
had
it
ceased
to
vibrate
when
the
dying
man
uttered
a
cry
the
priest
rose
and
went
to
the
side
of
the
bed
with
that
cry
the
baron
raoul
had
breathed
his
last
it
was
exactly
one
second
after
the
half
hour
after
nine
chapter
xix
the
dead
and
the
living
at
the
same
moment
that
the
trembling
soul
of
the
young
baron
passed
away
thibault
awaking
as
if
from
an
agitated
sleep
full
of
terrible
dreams
sat
up
in
his
bed
he
was
surrounded
by
fire
every
corner
of
his
hut
was
in
flames
at
first
he
thought
it
was
a
continuation
of
his
nightmare
but
then
he
heard
cries
of
death
to
the
wizard
death
to
the
sorcerer
death
to
the
and
he
understood
that
some
terrible
attack
was
being
made
upon
him
the
flames
came
nearer
they
reached
the
bed
he
felt
their
heat
upon
him
a
few
seconds
more
and
he
would
be
burned
alive
in
the
midst
of
the
flaming
pile
thibault
leaped
from
his
bed
seized
his
and
dashed
out
of
the
back
door
of
his
hut
no
sooner
did
his
enemies
see
him
rush
through
the
fire
and
emerge
from
the
smoke
than
their
cries
of
death
to
him
death
were
redoubled
one
or
two
shots
were
fired
at
him
thibault
heard
the
bullets
whizz
past
those
who
shot
at
him
wore
the
livery
of
the
grand
master
and
thibault
recalled
the
menace
of
the
lord
of
vez
uttered
against
him
a
few
days
before
he
was
then
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
he
could
be
smoked
out
of
his
hole
like
a
fox
he
could
be
shot
down
like
a
buck
luckily
for
thibault
not
one
of
the
bullets
struck
him
and
as
the
circle
of
fire
made
by
the
burning
hut
was
not
a
large
one
he
was
soon
safely
beyond
it
and
once
again
in
shelter
of
the
vast
and
gloomy
forest
where
had
it
not
been
for
the
cries
of
the
menials
who
were
burning
down
his
house
the
silence
would
have
been
as
complete
as
the
darkness
he
sat
down
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
and
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
the
events
of
the
last
hours
had
succeeded
each
other
with
such
rapidity
that
there
was
no
lack
of
matter
to
serve
as
subjects
of
reflection
to
the
the
hours
during
which
he
had
lived
another
existence
than
his
own
seemed
to
him
like
a
dream
so
much
so
that
he
would
not
have
dared
to
take
his
oath
that
all
this
recent
affair
between
the
baron
and
the
countess
jane
and
the
comte
de
had
really
taken
place
the
church
clock
of
oigny
struck
ten
and
he
lifted
his
head
ten
o
clock
and
only
before
he
had
been
still
in
the
body
of
the
baron
raoul
as
he
lay
dying
in
the
house
of
the
curé
of
puiseux
ah
he
exclaimed
i
must
find
out
for
certain
what
has
happened
it
is
not
quite
three
miles
to
puiseux
and
i
shall
be
there
in
i
should
like
to
ascertain
if
the
baron
is
really
a
melancholy
howl
made
answer
to
his
words
he
looked
round
his
faithful
were
back
again
he
had
his
pack
about
him
once
more
come
wolves
come
my
only
friends
he
cried
let
us
be
off
and
he
started
with
them
across
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
puiseux
the
huntsmen
of
the
lord
of
vez
who
were
poking
up
the
remaining
embers
of
the
ruined
hut
saw
a
man
pass
as
in
a
vision
running
at
the
head
of
a
dozen
or
more
wolves
they
crossed
themselves
and
became
more
convinced
than
ever
that
thibault
was
a
wizard
and
anybody
else
who
had
seen
thibault
flying
along
as
swiftly
as
his
swiftest
wolf
and
covering
the
ground
between
oigny
and
puiseux
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
would
certainly
have
thought
so
too
he
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
and
turning
to
his
wolves
he
said
friend
wolves
i
have
no
further
need
of
you
and
indeed
i
wish
to
be
alone
amuse
yourselves
with
the
stables
in
the
neighbourhood
i
give
you
leave
to
do
just
what
you
like
and
if
you
chance
to
come
across
one
of
those
animals
called
men
forget
friend
wolves
that
they
claim
to
be
made
in
the
image
of
their
creator
and
never
fear
to
satisfy
your
whereupon
the
wolves
rushed
off
in
different
directions
uttering
howls
of
joy
while
thibault
went
on
into
the
village
the
curé
s
house
adjoined
the
church
and
thibault
made
a
circuit
so
as
to
avoid
passing
in
front
of
the
cross
when
he
reached
the
presbytery
he
looked
in
through
one
of
the
windows
and
there
he
saw
a
bed
with
a
lighted
wax
candle
beside
it
and
over
the
bed
itself
was
spread
a
sheet
and
beneath
the
sheet
could
be
seen
the
outlines
of
a
figure
lying
rigid
in
death
there
appeared
to
be
no
one
in
the
house
the
priest
had
no
doubt
gone
to
give
notice
of
the
death
to
the
village
authorities
thibault
went
inside
and
called
the
priest
but
no
one
answered
he
walked
up
to
the
bed
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
the
body
under
the
sheet
being
that
of
a
dead
man
he
lifted
the
sheet
there
could
be
no
mistaking
that
the
dead
body
was
that
of
raoul
de
vauparfond
on
his
face
lay
the
still
unearthly
beauty
which
is
born
of
eternity
his
features
which
in
life
had
been
somewhat
too
feminine
for
those
of
a
man
had
now
assumed
the
sombre
grandeur
of
death
at
the
first
glance
you
might
have
thought
he
only
slept
but
on
gazing
longer
you
recognised
in
that
immovable
calm
something
more
profound
than
sleep
the
presence
of
one
who
carries
a
sickle
for
sceptre
and
wears
a
shroud
for
mantle
was
unmistakeable
and
you
knew
king
death
was
there
thibault
had
left
the
door
open
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
light
footsteps
approaching
at
the
back
of
the
alcove
hung
a
serge
curtain
which
masked
a
door
by
which
he
could
retreat
if
necessary
and
he
now
went
and
placed
himself
behind
it
a
woman
dressed
in
black
and
covered
with
a
black
veil
paused
in
some
hesitation
at
the
door
the
head
of
another
woman
passed
in
front
of
her
s
and
looked
carefully
round
the
room
i
think
it
is
safe
for
madame
to
go
in
i
see
no
one
about
and
besides
i
will
keep
the
woman
in
black
went
in
walked
slowly
towards
the
bed
stopped
a
moment
to
wipe
the
perspiration
from
her
forehead
then
without
further
hesitation
lifted
the
sheet
which
thibault
had
thrown
back
over
the
face
of
the
dead
man
thibault
then
saw
that
it
was
the
countess
alas
she
said
what
they
told
me
was
true
then
she
fell
on
her
knees
praying
and
sobbing
her
prayer
being
ended
she
rose
again
kissed
the
pale
forehead
of
the
dead
and
the
blue
marks
of
the
wound
through
which
the
soul
had
fled
o
my
my
raoul
she
murmured
who
will
tell
me
the
name
of
your
murderer
who
will
help
me
to
avenge
your
death
as
the
countess
finished
speaking
she
gave
a
cry
and
started
back
she
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
that
answered
i
will
and
something
had
shaken
the
green
serge
curtain
the
countess
however
was
no
woman
she
took
the
candle
that
was
burning
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
went
and
looked
behind
the
curtain
but
no
creature
was
to
be
seen
a
closed
door
was
all
that
met
her
eye
she
put
back
the
candle
took
a
pair
of
gold
scissors
from
a
little
pocket
case
cut
off
a
curl
of
the
dead
man
s
hair
placed
the
curl
in
a
black
velvet
sachet
which
hung
over
her
heart
gave
one
last
kiss
to
her
dead
lover
laid
the
sheet
over
his
face
and
left
the
house
just
as
she
was
crossing
the
threshold
she
met
the
priest
and
drawing
back
drew
her
veil
more
closely
over
her
face
who
are
you
asked
the
priest
i
am
grief
she
answered
and
the
priest
made
way
for
her
to
pass
the
countess
and
her
attendant
had
come
on
foot
and
were
returning
in
the
same
manner
for
the
distance
between
puiseux
and
was
not
much
more
than
when
about
half
way
along
their
road
a
man
who
had
been
hiding
behind
a
willow
tree
stepped
forward
and
barred
their
further
passage
lisette
screamed
but
the
countess
without
the
least
sign
of
fear
went
up
to
the
man
and
asked
who
are
you
the
man
who
answered
i
will
just
now
when
you
were
asking
who
would
denounce
the
murderer
to
and
you
can
help
me
to
revenge
myself
on
him
whenever
you
at
once
we
can
not
talk
here
very
where
can
we
find
a
better
place
in
your
own
room
for
we
must
not
enter
the
castle
no
but
i
can
go
through
the
breach
in
the
park
wall
mademoiselle
lisette
can
wait
for
me
in
the
hut
where
monsieur
raoul
used
to
leave
his
horse
she
can
take
me
up
the
and
into
your
room
if
you
should
be
in
your
i
will
wait
for
you
as
monsieur
raoul
waited
the
night
before
the
two
women
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
who
are
you
to
know
all
these
details
asked
the
countess
i
will
tell
you
when
the
time
comes
for
me
to
tell
the
countess
hesitated
a
moment
then
recovering
her
resolution
she
said
very
well
then
come
through
the
breach
lisette
will
wait
for
you
in
the
oh
madame
cried
the
maid
i
shall
never
dare
to
go
and
bring
that
man
to
you
i
will
go
myself
then
said
the
countess
well
said
put
in
thibault
there
spoke
a
woman
worth
calling
one
and
so
saying
he
slid
down
into
a
kind
of
ravine
beside
the
road
and
disappeared
lisette
very
nearly
fainted
lean
on
me
mademoiselle
said
the
countess
and
let
us
walk
on
i
am
anxious
to
hear
what
this
man
has
to
say
to
the
two
women
entered
the
castle
by
way
of
the
farm
no
one
had
seen
them
go
out
and
no
one
saw
them
return
on
reaching
her
room
the
countess
waited
for
lisette
to
bring
up
the
stranger
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
when
the
maid
hurried
in
with
a
pale
face
ah
madame
she
said
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
go
to
fetch
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
countess
because
he
knew
his
way
up
as
well
as
i
did
and
oh
madame
if
you
knew
what
he
said
to
me
that
man
is
the
devil
madame
i
feel
sure
show
him
in
said
the
countess
i
am
here
said
thibault
you
can
leave
us
now
my
girl
said
the
countess
to
lisette
the
latter
quitted
the
room
and
the
countess
remained
alone
with
thibault
thibault
s
appearance
was
not
one
to
inspire
confidence
he
gave
the
impression
of
a
man
who
had
once
and
for
all
made
up
his
mind
but
it
was
also
easy
to
see
that
it
was
for
no
good
purpose
a
satanic
smile
played
about
his
mouth
and
there
was
a
demoniacal
light
in
his
eyes
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
hide
his
red
hairs
but
had
left
them
defiantly
uncovered
and
they
hung
over
his
forehead
like
a
plume
of
flame
but
still
the
countess
looked
him
full
in
the
face
without
changing
colour
my
maid
says
that
you
know
the
way
to
my
room
have
you
ever
been
here
before
yes
madame
and
when
was
that
the
day
before
at
what
time
from
ten
till
twelve
at
the
countess
looked
steadily
at
him
and
said
that
is
not
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
what
took
place
during
the
time
you
mention
during
the
time
i
say
on
replied
the
countess
laconically
thibault
was
equally
laconic
monsieur
raoul
came
in
by
that
door
he
said
pointing
to
the
one
leading
into
the
corridor
and
lisette
left
him
here
alone
you
entered
the
room
by
that
one
he
continued
indicating
the
door
and
you
found
him
on
his
knees
your
hair
was
unbound
only
fastened
back
by
three
diamond
pins
you
wore
a
pink
silk
trimmed
with
lace
pink
silk
stockings
slippers
and
a
chain
of
pearls
round
your
you
describe
my
dress
exactly
said
the
countess
you
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
monsieur
raoul
first
because
he
loitered
in
the
corridors
to
kiss
your
secondly
because
someone
had
met
him
late
at
night
on
the
road
between
erneville
and
thirdly
because
at
the
ball
given
at
the
castle
at
which
you
yourself
were
not
present
he
danced
four
times
with
madame
de
in
answer
to
your
accusations
your
lover
made
excuses
for
himself
some
good
some
bad
you
however
were
satisfied
with
them
for
you
were
just
forgiving
him
when
lisette
rushed
in
full
of
alarm
calling
to
monsieur
raoul
to
escape
as
your
husband
had
just
lisette
was
right
you
can
be
nothing
less
than
the
devil
said
the
countess
with
a
sinister
laugh
and
i
think
we
shall
be
able
to
do
business
together
finish
your
then
you
and
your
maid
together
pushed
monsieur
raoul
who
resisted
into
the
lisette
forced
him
along
the
corridors
and
through
two
or
three
rooms
they
then
went
down
a
winding
staircase
in
the
wing
of
the
castle
opposite
to
the
one
by
which
they
had
gone
up
on
arriving
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
the
fugitives
found
the
door
locked
then
they
ran
into
a
kind
of
office
where
lisette
opened
the
window
which
was
about
seven
or
eight
feet
above
the
ground
monsieur
raoul
leaped
down
out
of
this
window
ran
to
the
stable
found
his
horse
still
there
but
hamstrung
then
he
swore
that
if
he
met
the
count
at
any
time
he
would
hamstring
him
as
the
count
had
hamstrung
his
horse
for
he
thought
it
a
cowardly
act
to
injure
a
poor
beast
so
unnecessarily
then
he
went
on
foot
to
the
breach
climbed
it
and
found
the
count
awaiting
him
outside
the
park
with
his
sword
drawn
the
baron
had
his
with
him
he
drew
it
and
the
duel
was
the
count
alone
wait
the
count
appeared
to
be
alone
after
the
fourth
or
fifth
pass
the
count
was
wounded
in
the
shoulder
and
sank
on
one
knee
crying
help
lestocq
then
the
baron
remembered
his
oath
and
hamstrung
the
count
as
he
had
hamstrung
the
horse
but
as
the
baron
rose
lestocq
drove
his
knife
into
his
back
it
passed
under
the
shoulder
blade
and
out
through
the
chest
i
need
not
tell
you
where
you
kissed
the
wound
and
after
that
the
count
and
his
huntsman
returned
to
the
castle
leaving
the
baron
lying
helpless
when
the
latter
came
to
he
made
signs
to
some
passing
peasants
who
put
him
on
a
litter
and
bore
him
away
with
the
intention
of
taking
him
to
but
he
was
in
such
pain
that
they
could
not
carry
him
farther
than
puiseux
there
they
laid
him
on
the
bed
where
you
found
him
and
on
which
he
breathed
his
last
a
second
after
the
half
hour
after
nine
in
the
the
countess
rose
and
without
speaking
went
to
her
and
took
out
the
pearls
she
had
worn
two
nights
before
she
handed
them
to
thibault
what
are
they
for
he
asked
take
them
said
the
countess
they
are
worth
fifty
thousand
are
you
still
anxious
for
revenge
yes
replied
the
countess
revenge
will
cost
more
than
how
much
will
it
cost
wait
for
me
night
said
thibault
and
i
will
tell
where
shall
i
await
you
asked
the
countess
here
said
thibault
with
the
leer
of
a
wild
animal
i
will
await
you
here
said
the
countess
till
till
thibault
went
out
the
countess
went
and
replaced
the
pearls
in
her
dressing
case
lifted
up
a
false
bottom
and
drew
from
underneath
it
a
small
bottle
containing
an
liquid
and
a
little
dagger
with
a
jewelled
handle
and
case
and
a
blade
inlaid
with
gold
she
hid
both
beneath
her
pillow
knelt
at
her
and
her
prayer
finished
threw
herself
dressed
on
to
her
bed
chapter
xx
true
to
tryst
on
quitting
the
countess
s
room
thibault
had
left
the
castle
by
the
way
which
he
had
described
to
her
and
soon
found
himself
safe
beyond
its
walls
and
outside
the
park
and
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
thibault
had
really
nowhere
to
go
his
hut
was
burnt
he
was
without
a
friend
and
like
cain
he
was
a
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
he
turned
to
the
unfailing
shelter
of
the
forest
and
there
made
his
way
to
the
lower
end
of
chavigny
as
the
day
was
breaking
he
came
across
a
solitary
house
and
asked
if
he
could
buy
some
bread
the
woman
belonging
to
it
her
husband
being
away
gave
him
some
but
refused
to
receive
payment
for
it
his
appearance
frightened
her
having
now
food
sufficient
for
the
day
thibault
returned
to
the
forest
with
the
intention
of
spending
his
time
till
evening
in
a
part
which
he
knew
between
fleury
and
longpont
where
the
trees
were
especially
thick
and
tall
as
he
was
looking
for
a
resting
place
behind
a
rock
his
eye
was
attracted
by
a
shining
object
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
slope
and
his
curiosity
led
him
to
climb
down
and
see
what
it
was
the
shining
object
was
the
silver
badge
belonging
to
a
huntsman
s
the
was
slung
round
the
neck
of
a
dead
body
or
rather
of
a
skeleton
for
the
flesh
had
been
entirely
eaten
off
the
bones
which
were
as
clean
as
if
prepared
for
an
anatomist
s
study
or
a
painter
s
studio
the
skeleton
looked
as
if
it
had
only
lain
there
since
the
preceding
night
ah
ah
said
thibault
this
is
probably
the
work
of
my
friends
the
wolves
they
evidently
profited
by
the
permission
which
i
gave
curious
to
know
if
possible
who
the
victim
was
he
examined
it
more
closely
his
curiosity
was
soon
satisfied
for
the
badge
which
the
wolves
had
no
doubt
rejected
as
less
easily
digestible
than
the
rest
was
lying
on
the
chest
of
the
skeleton
like
a
ticket
on
a
bale
of
goods
j
lestocq
head
keeper
to
the
comte
de
well
done
laughed
thibault
here
is
one
at
least
who
did
not
live
long
to
enjoy
the
result
of
his
murderous
then
contracting
his
brow
he
muttered
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
and
this
time
without
laughing
is
there
perhaps
after
all
what
people
call
a
providence
lestocq
s
death
was
not
difficult
to
account
for
he
had
probably
been
executing
some
order
for
his
master
that
night
and
on
the
road
between
and
longpont
had
been
attacked
by
wolves
he
had
defended
himself
with
the
same
knife
with
which
he
had
wounded
the
baron
for
thibault
found
the
knife
a
few
paces
off
at
a
spot
where
the
ground
showed
traces
of
a
severe
struggle
at
last
being
disarmed
the
ferocious
beasts
had
dragged
him
into
the
hollow
and
there
devoured
him
thibault
was
becoming
so
indifferent
to
everything
that
he
felt
neither
pleasure
nor
regret
neither
satisfaction
nor
remorse
at
lestocq
s
death
all
he
thought
was
that
it
simplified
matters
for
the
countess
as
she
would
now
only
have
her
husband
upon
whom
she
need
revenge
herself
then
he
went
and
found
a
place
where
the
rocks
afforded
him
the
best
shelter
from
the
wind
and
prepared
to
spend
his
day
there
in
peace
towards
he
heard
the
horn
of
the
lord
of
vez
and
the
cry
of
his
hounds
the
mighty
huntsman
was
after
game
but
the
chase
did
not
pass
near
enough
to
thibault
to
disturb
him
at
last
the
night
came
at
nine
o
clock
thibault
rose
and
set
out
for
the
castle
of
he
found
the
breach
followed
the
path
he
knew
and
came
to
the
little
hut
where
lisette
had
been
awaiting
him
on
the
night
when
he
had
come
in
the
guise
of
raoul
the
poor
girl
was
there
this
evening
but
alarmed
and
trembling
thibault
wished
to
carry
out
the
old
traditions
and
tried
to
kiss
her
but
she
sprang
back
with
visible
signs
of
fear
do
not
touch
me
she
said
or
i
shall
call
oh
indeed
my
pretty
one
said
thibault
you
were
not
so
the
other
day
with
the
baron
may
be
not
said
the
girl
but
a
great
many
things
have
happened
since
the
other
and
many
more
to
happen
still
said
thibault
in
a
lively
tone
i
think
said
the
in
a
mournful
voice
that
the
climax
is
already
then
as
she
went
on
in
front
if
you
wish
to
come
she
added
follow
thibault
followed
her
lisette
without
the
slightest
effort
at
concealment
walked
straight
across
the
open
space
that
lay
between
the
trees
and
the
castle
you
are
courageous
said
thibault
and
supposing
some
one
were
to
see
us
there
is
no
fear
now
she
answered
the
eyes
that
could
have
seen
us
are
all
although
he
did
not
understand
what
the
young
girl
meant
by
these
words
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
made
thibault
shiver
he
continued
to
follow
her
in
silence
as
they
went
up
the
to
the
first
floor
as
lisette
laid
her
hand
on
the
key
of
the
door
thibault
suddenly
stopped
her
something
in
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
castle
filled
him
with
fear
it
seemed
as
if
a
curse
might
have
fallen
on
the
place
where
are
we
going
said
thibault
scarcely
knowing
himself
what
he
said
you
know
well
enough
into
the
countess
s
room
into
the
countess
s
she
is
waiting
for
me
she
is
waiting
for
and
lisette
opened
the
door
go
in
she
said
thibault
went
in
and
lisette
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
waited
outside
it
was
the
same
exquisite
room
lighted
in
the
same
manner
filled
with
the
same
sweet
scent
thibault
looked
round
for
the
countess
he
expected
to
see
her
appear
at
the
door
but
the
door
remained
closed
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
in
the
room
except
the
ticking
of
the
sèvres
clock
and
the
beating
of
thibault
s
heart
he
began
to
look
about
him
with
a
feeling
of
shuddering
fear
for
which
he
could
not
account
then
his
eyes
fell
on
the
bed
the
countess
was
lying
asleep
upon
it
in
her
hair
were
the
same
diamond
pins
round
her
neck
the
same
pearls
she
was
dressed
in
the
same
pink
silk
and
had
on
the
same
little
slippers
of
cloth
of
silver
which
she
had
worn
to
receive
the
baron
raoul
thibault
went
up
to
her
the
countess
did
not
stir
you
are
sleeping
fair
countess
he
said
leaning
over
to
look
at
her
but
all
at
once
he
started
upright
staring
before
him
his
hair
standing
on
end
the
sweat
breaking
out
on
his
forehead
the
terrible
truth
was
beginning
to
dawn
upon
him
was
the
countess
sleeping
the
sleep
of
this
world
or
of
eternity
he
fetched
a
light
from
the
and
with
trembling
hand
held
it
to
the
face
of
the
mysterious
sleeper
it
was
pale
as
ivory
with
the
delicate
veins
traced
over
the
temples
and
the
lips
still
red
a
drop
of
pink
burning
wax
fell
on
this
still
face
of
sleep
it
did
not
awake
the
countess
ah
cried
thibault
what
is
this
and
he
put
down
the
candle
which
his
shaking
hand
could
no
longer
hold
on
the
the
countess
lay
with
her
arms
stretched
out
close
to
her
sides
she
appeared
to
be
clasping
something
in
either
hand
with
some
effort
thibault
was
able
to
open
the
left
one
within
it
he
found
the
little
bottle
which
she
had
taken
from
her
dressing
case
the
night
before
he
opened
the
other
hand
within
it
lay
a
piece
of
paper
on
which
were
written
these
few
words
true
to
tryst
yes
true
and
faithful
unto
death
for
the
countess
was
dead
all
thibault
s
illusions
were
fading
one
after
the
other
like
the
dreams
of
the
night
which
gradually
fade
away
as
the
sleeper
becomes
more
and
more
thoroughly
awake
there
was
a
difference
however
for
other
men
find
their
dead
alive
again
in
their
dreams
but
with
thibault
his
dead
did
not
arise
and
walk
but
remained
lying
for
ever
in
their
last
sleep
he
wiped
his
forehead
went
to
the
door
leading
into
the
corridor
and
opened
it
to
find
lisette
on
her
knees
praying
is
the
countess
dead
then
asked
thibault
the
countess
is
dead
and
the
count
is
from
the
effect
of
the
wounds
given
him
by
the
baron
raoul
no
from
the
blow
with
the
dagger
given
him
by
the
ah
said
thibault
grimacing
hideously
in
his
effort
to
force
a
laugh
in
the
midst
of
this
grim
drama
all
this
tale
you
hint
at
is
new
to
then
lisette
told
him
the
tale
in
full
it
was
a
plain
tale
but
a
terrible
one
the
countess
had
remained
in
bed
part
of
the
day
listening
to
the
village
bells
of
puiseux
which
were
tolling
as
the
baron
s
body
was
being
borne
from
thence
to
vauparfond
where
he
was
to
be
laid
in
the
family
grave
towards
four
o
clock
the
bells
ceased
then
the
countess
rose
took
the
dagger
from
under
her
pillow
hid
it
in
her
breast
and
went
towards
her
husband
s
room
she
found
the
valet
in
attendance
in
good
spirits
the
doctor
had
just
left
having
examined
the
wound
and
declared
the
count
s
life
out
of
danger
madame
will
agree
that
it
is
a
thing
to
rejoice
at
said
the
valet
yes
to
rejoice
at
and
the
countess
went
on
into
her
husband
s
room
five
minutes
later
she
left
it
again
the
count
is
sleeping
she
said
do
not
go
in
until
he
the
valet
bowed
and
sat
down
in
the
to
be
in
readiness
at
the
first
call
from
his
master
the
countess
went
back
to
her
room
undress
me
lisette
she
said
to
her
waiting
maid
and
give
me
the
clothes
that
i
had
on
the
last
time
the
maid
obeyed
we
have
already
seen
how
every
detail
of
toilet
was
arranged
exactly
as
it
had
been
on
that
fatal
night
then
the
countess
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
she
folded
and
kept
in
her
right
hand
after
that
she
lay
down
on
her
bed
will
madame
not
take
anything
asked
the
maid
the
countess
opened
her
left
hand
and
showed
her
a
little
bottle
she
was
holding
inside
it
yes
lisette
she
said
i
am
going
to
take
what
is
in
this
what
nothing
but
that
said
lisette
it
will
be
enough
lisette
for
after
i
have
taken
it
i
shall
have
need
of
nothing
and
as
she
spoke
she
put
the
bottle
to
her
mouth
and
drank
the
contents
at
a
draught
then
she
said
you
saw
that
man
lisette
who
waited
for
us
in
the
road
i
have
a
meeting
with
him
this
evening
here
in
my
room
at
half
past
nine
you
know
where
to
go
and
wait
for
him
and
you
will
bring
him
here
i
do
not
wish
that
anyone
should
be
able
to
say
that
i
was
not
true
to
my
word
ever
after
i
am
thibault
had
nothing
to
say
the
agreement
made
between
them
had
been
kept
only
the
countess
had
accomplished
her
revenge
herself
as
everyone
understood
when
the
valet
feeling
uneasy
about
his
master
and
going
softly
into
his
room
to
look
at
him
found
him
lying
on
his
back
with
a
dagger
in
his
heart
and
then
hurrying
to
tell
madame
what
had
happened
found
the
countess
dead
also
the
news
of
this
double
death
soon
spread
through
the
castle
and
all
the
servants
had
fled
saying
that
the
exterminating
angel
was
in
the
castle
the
alone
remained
to
carry
out
her
dead
mistress
s
wishes
thibault
had
nothing
more
to
do
at
the
castle
so
he
left
the
countess
on
her
bed
with
lisette
near
her
and
went
down
stairs
as
lisette
had
said
there
was
no
fear
now
of
meeting
either
master
or
servants
the
servants
had
run
away
the
master
and
mistress
were
dead
thibault
once
more
made
for
the
breach
in
the
wall
the
sky
was
dark
and
if
it
had
not
been
january
you
might
have
imagined
a
thunder
storm
was
brewing
there
was
barely
light
enough
to
see
the
footpath
as
he
went
along
once
or
twice
thibault
paused
he
fancied
he
had
detected
the
sound
of
the
dry
branches
cracking
under
someone
s
footsteps
keeping
pace
with
his
both
to
right
and
left
having
come
to
the
breach
thibault
distinctly
heard
a
voice
say
that
s
the
man
and
at
the
same
moment
two
gendarmes
concealed
on
the
farther
side
of
the
wall
seized
thibault
by
the
collar
while
two
others
came
up
behind
it
appeared
that
cramoisi
jealous
with
regard
to
lisette
had
been
prowling
about
at
nights
on
the
watch
and
had
only
the
evening
before
noticed
a
strange
man
come
in
and
go
out
of
the
park
along
the
more
secluded
paths
and
he
had
reported
the
fact
to
the
head
of
the
police
when
the
recent
serious
events
that
had
taken
place
at
the
castle
became
generally
known
orders
were
given
to
send
four
men
and
take
up
any
suspicious
looking
person
seen
prowling
about
two
of
the
men
with
cramoisi
for
guide
had
ambushed
on
the
farther
side
of
the
breach
and
the
two
others
had
dogged
thibault
through
the
park
then
as
we
have
seen
at
the
signal
given
by
cramoisi
they
had
all
four
fallen
upon
him
as
he
issued
from
the
breach
there
was
a
long
and
obstinate
struggle
thibault
was
not
a
man
that
even
four
others
could
overcome
without
difficulty
but
he
had
no
weapon
by
him
and
his
resistance
was
therefore
useless
the
gendarmes
had
been
more
bent
on
securing
him
on
account
of
having
recognised
that
it
was
thibault
and
thibault
was
beginning
to
earn
a
very
bad
name
so
many
misfortunes
having
become
associated
with
it
so
thibault
was
knocked
down
and
finally
bound
and
led
off
between
two
mounted
men
the
other
two
gendarmes
walked
one
in
front
and
one
behind
thibault
had
merely
struggled
out
of
a
natural
feeling
of
and
pride
for
his
power
to
inflict
evil
was
as
we
know
unlimited
and
he
had
but
to
wish
his
assailants
dead
and
they
would
have
fallen
lifeless
at
his
feet
but
he
thought
there
was
time
enough
for
that
as
long
as
there
still
remained
a
wish
to
him
he
could
escape
from
man
s
justice
even
though
he
were
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
so
thibault
securely
bound
his
hands
tied
and
fetters
upon
his
feet
walked
along
between
his
four
gendarmes
apparently
in
a
state
of
resignation
one
of
the
gendarmes
held
the
end
of
the
rope
with
which
he
was
bound
and
the
four
men
made
jokes
and
laughed
at
him
asking
the
wizard
thibault
why
being
possessed
of
such
power
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
and
thibault
replied
to
their
scoffings
with
the
proverb
he
laughs
best
who
laughs
last
and
the
gendarmes
expressed
a
wish
that
they
might
be
the
ones
to
do
so
on
leaving
puiseux
behind
they
came
to
the
forest
the
weather
was
growing
more
and
more
threatening
the
dark
clouds
hung
so
low
that
the
trees
looked
as
if
they
were
holding
up
a
huge
black
veil
and
it
was
impossible
to
see
four
steps
ahead
but
he
thibault
saw
saw
lights
swiftly
passing
and
crossing
one
another
in
the
darkness
on
either
side
closer
and
closer
drew
the
lights
and
pattering
footfalls
were
heard
among
the
dry
leaves
the
horses
became
restive
shied
and
snorted
sniffing
the
air
and
trembling
beneath
their
riders
while
the
coarse
laughter
of
the
men
themselves
died
down
it
was
thibault
s
turn
to
laugh
now
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
one
of
the
gendarmes
i
am
laughing
at
your
having
left
off
laughing
said
thibault
the
lights
drew
nearer
and
the
footfalls
became
more
distinct
at
the
sound
of
thibault
s
voice
then
a
more
ominous
sound
was
heard
a
sound
of
teeth
striking
together
as
jaws
opened
and
shut
yes
yes
my
friends
said
thibault
you
have
tasted
human
flesh
and
you
found
it
he
was
answered
by
a
low
growl
of
approbation
half
like
a
dog
s
and
half
like
a
hyena
s
quite
so
said
thibault
i
understand
after
having
made
a
meal
of
a
keeper
you
would
not
mind
tasting
a
the
gendarmes
themselves
were
beginning
to
shudder
with
fear
to
whom
are
you
talking
they
asked
him
to
those
who
can
answer
me
said
thibault
and
he
gave
a
howl
twenty
or
more
howls
responded
some
from
close
at
hand
some
from
farther
off
h
m
said
one
of
the
gendarmes
what
are
these
beasts
that
are
following
us
this
seems
to
understand
their
language
what
said
the
you
take
thibault
the
prisoner
you
carry
him
through
the
forest
at
night
and
then
you
ask
what
are
the
lights
and
the
howls
that
follow
him
do
you
hear
friends
cried
thibault
these
gentlemen
are
asking
who
you
are
answer
them
all
of
you
together
that
they
may
have
no
further
doubt
on
the
the
wolves
obedient
to
their
master
s
voice
gave
one
prolonged
unanimous
howl
the
horses
panted
and
shivered
and
one
or
two
of
them
reared
the
gendarmes
endeavoured
to
calm
their
animals
patting
and
gentling
them
that
is
nothing
said
thibault
wait
till
you
see
each
horse
with
two
wolves
hanging
on
to
its
and
another
at
its
the
wolves
now
came
in
between
the
horses
legs
and
began
caressing
thibault
one
of
them
stood
up
and
put
its
front
paws
on
thibault
s
chest
as
if
asking
for
orders
presently
presently
said
thibault
there
is
plenty
of
time
do
not
be
selfish
give
your
comrades
time
to
come
the
men
could
no
longer
control
their
horses
which
were
rearing
and
shying
and
although
going
at
a
foot
s
pace
were
streaming
with
sweat
do
you
not
think
said
thibault
you
would
do
best
now
to
come
to
terms
with
me
that
is
if
you
were
to
let
me
free
on
condition
that
you
all
sleep
in
your
beds
go
at
a
walking
pace
said
one
of
the
gendarmes
as
long
as
we
do
that
we
have
nothing
to
another
one
drew
his
sword
a
second
or
two
later
there
was
a
howl
of
pain
one
of
the
wolves
had
seized
hold
of
this
gendarme
s
boot
and
the
latter
had
pierced
him
through
with
his
weapon
i
call
that
a
very
imprudent
thing
to
do
said
thibault
the
wolves
eat
each
other
whatever
the
proverb
may
say
and
once
having
tasted
blood
i
do
not
know
that
even
i
shall
have
the
power
to
hold
them
the
wolves
threw
themselves
in
a
body
on
their
wounded
comrade
and
in
five
minutes
there
was
nothing
left
of
its
carcase
but
the
bare
bones
the
gendarmes
had
profited
by
this
respite
to
get
on
ahead
but
without
releasing
thibault
whom
they
obliged
to
run
alongside
of
them
what
he
had
foreseen
however
happened
there
was
a
sudden
sound
as
of
an
approaching
hurricane
the
whole
pack
was
in
pursuit
following
them
up
at
full
gallop
the
horses
having
once
started
trotting
refused
to
go
at
a
walking
pace
again
and
frightened
by
the
stamping
the
smell
and
the
howls
now
set
off
galloping
in
spite
of
their
riders
efforts
to
hold
them
in
the
man
who
had
hold
of
the
rope
now
requiring
both
hands
to
master
his
horse
let
go
of
thibault
and
the
wolves
leaped
on
to
the
horses
clinging
desperately
to
the
cruppers
and
withers
and
throats
of
the
terrified
animals
no
sooner
had
the
latter
felt
the
sharp
teeth
of
their
assailants
than
they
scattered
rushing
in
every
direction
hurrah
wolves
hurrah
cried
thibault
but
the
fierce
animals
had
no
need
of
encouragement
and
soon
each
horse
had
six
or
seven
more
wolves
in
pursuit
of
him
horses
and
wolves
disappeared
some
one
way
some
the
other
and
the
men
s
cries
of
distress
the
agonised
neighings
of
the
horses
and
the
furious
howls
of
the
wolves
became
gradually
fainter
and
fainter
as
they
travelled
farther
away
thibault
was
left
free
once
more
and
alone
his
hands
however
were
still
bound
and
his
feet
fettered
first
he
tried
to
undo
the
cord
with
his
teeth
but
this
he
found
impossible
then
he
tried
to
wrench
his
bonds
apart
by
the
power
of
his
muscles
but
that
too
was
unavailing
the
only
result
of
his
efforts
was
to
make
the
cord
cut
into
his
flesh
it
was
his
turn
to
bellow
with
pain
and
anger
at
last
tired
of
trying
to
wrest
his
hands
free
he
lifted
them
bound
as
they
were
to
heaven
and
cried
oh
black
wolf
friend
let
these
cords
that
bind
me
be
loosened
thou
knowest
well
that
it
is
only
to
do
evil
that
i
wish
for
my
hands
to
be
and
at
the
same
moment
his
fetters
were
broken
and
fell
to
the
ground
and
thibault
beat
his
hands
together
with
another
roar
this
time
of
joy
chapter
xxi
the
genius
of
evil
the
next
evening
about
nine
o
clock
a
man
might
be
seen
walking
along
the
road
and
making
for
the
osiéres
it
was
thibault
on
his
way
to
pay
a
last
visit
to
the
hut
and
to
see
if
any
remains
of
it
had
been
left
by
the
fire
a
heap
of
smoking
cinders
alone
marked
the
place
where
it
had
stood
and
as
thibault
came
in
sight
of
it
he
saw
the
wolves
as
if
he
had
appointed
them
to
meet
him
there
forming
an
immense
circle
round
the
ruins
and
looking
upon
them
with
an
expression
of
mournful
anger
they
seemed
to
understand
that
by
destroying
this
poor
hut
made
of
earth
and
branches
the
one
who
by
the
compact
with
the
black
wolf
had
been
given
them
for
master
had
been
made
a
victim
as
thibault
entered
the
circle
all
the
wolves
gave
simultaneously
a
long
and
sinister
sounding
howl
as
if
to
make
him
understand
that
they
were
ready
to
help
in
avenging
him
thibault
went
and
sat
down
on
the
spot
where
the
hearth
had
stood
it
was
recognisable
from
a
few
blackened
stones
still
remaining
which
were
otherwise
uninjured
and
by
a
higher
heap
of
cinders
just
at
that
spot
he
stayed
there
some
minutes
absorbed
in
his
unhappy
thoughts
but
he
was
not
reflecting
that
the
ruin
which
he
saw
around
him
was
the
consequence
and
the
punishment
of
his
jealous
and
covetous
desires
which
had
gone
on
gathering
strength
he
felt
neither
repentance
nor
regret
that
which
dominated
all
other
feeling
in
him
was
his
satisfaction
at
the
thought
of
being
henceforth
able
to
render
to
his
evil
for
evil
his
pride
in
having
thanks
to
his
terrible
auxiliaries
the
power
to
fight
against
those
who
persecuted
him
and
as
the
wolves
continued
their
melancholy
howling
yes
my
friends
said
thibault
yes
your
howls
answer
to
the
cry
of
my
heart
my
have
destroyed
my
hut
they
have
cast
to
the
winds
the
ashes
of
the
tools
wherewith
i
earned
my
daily
bread
their
hatred
pursues
me
as
it
pursues
you
i
expect
from
them
neither
mercy
nor
pity
we
are
their
enemies
as
they
are
ours
and
i
will
have
neither
mercy
nor
compassion
on
them
come
then
let
us
go
from
this
hut
to
the
castle
and
carry
thither
the
desolation
which
they
have
brought
home
to
and
then
the
master
of
the
wolves
like
a
chief
of
banditti
followed
by
his
desperadoes
set
off
with
his
pack
in
quest
of
pillage
and
carnage
this
time
it
was
neither
nor
nor
any
timid
game
of
which
they
were
in
pursuit
sheltered
by
the
darkness
of
the
night
thibault
first
directed
his
course
to
the
château
of
vez
for
there
was
lodged
his
chief
enemy
the
baron
had
three
farms
belonging
to
the
estate
stables
filled
with
horses
and
others
filled
with
cows
and
the
park
was
full
of
sheep
all
these
places
were
attacked
the
first
night
and
on
the
morrow
two
horses
four
cows
and
ten
sheep
were
found
killed
the
baron
was
doubtful
at
first
if
this
could
be
the
work
of
the
beasts
against
which
he
waged
so
fierce
a
warfare
there
seemed
something
partaking
rather
of
intelligence
and
revenge
in
it
than
of
the
mere
unreasoning
attacks
of
a
pack
of
wild
animals
still
it
seemed
manifest
that
the
wolves
must
have
been
the
aggressors
judging
by
the
marks
of
teeth
on
the
carcases
and
the
footprints
left
on
the
ground
next
night
the
baron
set
watchers
to
lie
in
wait
but
thibault
and
his
wolves
were
at
work
on
the
farther
side
of
the
forest
this
time
it
was
the
stables
and
parks
of
soucy
and
of
vivierès
which
were
decimated
and
the
following
night
those
of
boursonnes
and
yvors
the
work
of
annihilation
once
begun
must
be
carried
out
with
desperate
determination
and
the
master
never
left
his
wolves
now
he
slept
with
them
in
their
dens
and
lived
in
the
midst
of
them
stimulating
their
thirst
for
blood
many
a
woodman
many
a
came
face
to
face
in
the
thickets
with
the
menacing
white
teeth
of
a
wolf
and
was
either
carried
off
and
eaten
or
just
saved
his
life
by
the
aid
of
his
courage
and
his
guided
by
a
human
intelligence
the
wolves
had
become
organised
and
disciplined
and
were
far
more
formidable
than
a
band
of
discontented
soldiery
let
loose
in
a
conquered
country
the
terror
of
them
became
general
no
one
dared
go
beyond
the
towns
and
villages
unarmed
horses
and
cattle
were
all
fed
inside
the
stables
and
the
men
themselves
their
work
done
waited
for
one
another
so
as
not
to
go
about
singly
the
bishop
of
soissons
ordered
public
prayer
to
be
made
asking
god
to
send
a
thaw
for
the
unusual
ferocity
of
the
wolves
was
attributed
to
the
great
quantity
of
snow
that
had
fallen
but
the
report
also
went
about
that
the
wolves
were
incited
to
their
work
and
led
about
by
a
man
that
this
man
was
more
indefatigable
more
cruel
and
insatiable
than
the
wolves
themselves
that
in
imitation
of
his
companions
he
ate
raw
flesh
and
quenched
his
thirst
in
blood
and
the
people
went
further
and
said
that
this
man
was
thibault
the
bishop
pronounced
sentence
of
excommunication
against
the
former
the
lord
of
vez
however
had
little
faith
in
the
thunders
of
the
church
being
of
much
effect
unless
supported
by
some
hunting
he
was
somewhat
cast
down
at
so
much
blood
being
spilt
and
his
pride
was
sorely
hurt
that
his
the
grand
master
s
own
cattle
should
have
suffered
so
heavily
from
the
very
wolves
he
was
especially
appointed
to
destroy
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
but
feel
a
secret
delight
at
the
thought
of
the
triumphant
in
store
for
him
and
of
the
fame
which
he
could
not
fail
to
win
among
all
sportsmen
of
repute
his
passion
for
the
chase
excited
by
the
way
in
which
his
adversaries
the
wolves
had
so
openly
entered
upon
the
struggle
became
absolutely
overpowering
he
allowed
neither
respite
nor
repose
he
took
no
sleep
himself
and
ate
his
meals
in
the
saddle
all
night
long
he
scoured
the
country
in
company
with
l
eveillé
and
engoulevent
who
in
consideration
of
his
marriage
had
been
raised
to
the
rank
of
pricker
and
the
dawn
had
no
sooner
appeared
before
he
was
again
in
the
saddle
ready
to
start
and
chase
the
wolf
until
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
the
hounds
but
alas
all
his
knowledge
of
the
art
of
venery
all
his
courage
all
his
perseverance
were
lost
labour
he
occasionally
brought
down
some
wretched
cub
some
miserable
beast
eaten
with
mange
some
imprudent
glutton
which
had
so
gorged
itself
with
carnage
that
its
breath
would
not
hold
out
after
an
hour
or
two
s
run
but
the
larger
wolves
with
their
thick
dark
coats
their
muscles
like
steel
springs
and
their
long
slender
feet
not
one
of
these
lost
a
hair
in
the
war
that
was
being
made
upon
them
thanks
to
thibault
they
met
their
enemies
in
arms
on
nearly
equal
ground
as
the
baron
of
vez
remained
for
ever
with
his
dogs
so
did
thibault
with
his
wolves
after
a
night
of
sack
and
pillage
he
kept
the
pack
awake
on
the
watch
to
help
the
one
that
the
baron
had
started
this
wolf
again
following
thibault
s
instructions
had
recourse
at
first
to
stratagem
it
doubled
crossed
its
tracks
waded
in
the
streams
leaped
up
into
the
bending
trees
so
as
to
make
it
more
difficult
still
for
huntsmen
and
hounds
to
follow
the
scent
and
finally
when
it
felt
its
powers
failing
it
adopted
bolder
measures
and
went
straight
ahead
then
the
other
wolves
and
their
master
intervened
at
the
least
sign
of
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
hounds
they
managed
so
cleverly
to
put
them
on
the
wrong
scent
that
it
required
an
experienced
eye
to
detect
that
the
dogs
were
not
all
following
up
the
same
track
and
nothing
less
than
the
baron
s
profound
knowledge
could
decide
which
was
the
right
one
even
he
sometimes
was
mistaken
again
the
wolves
in
their
turn
followed
the
huntsmen
it
was
a
pack
hunting
a
pack
only
the
one
hunted
in
silence
which
made
it
far
the
more
formidable
of
the
two
did
a
tired
hound
fall
behind
or
another
get
separated
from
the
main
body
it
was
seized
and
killed
in
an
instant
and
engoulevent
whom
we
have
had
occasion
to
mention
several
times
before
and
who
had
taken
poor
marcotte
s
place
having
hastened
one
day
to
the
help
of
one
of
his
hounds
that
was
uttering
cries
of
distress
was
himself
attacked
and
only
owed
his
life
to
the
swiftness
of
his
horse
it
was
not
long
before
the
baron
s
pack
was
decimated
his
best
hounds
were
nearly
dead
with
fatigue
and
his
more
ones
had
perished
by
the
wolves
teeth
the
stable
was
in
no
better
condition
than
the
kennel
bayard
was
foundered
tancred
had
sprained
a
tendon
leaping
over
a
ditch
and
a
strained
fetlock
had
placed
valourous
on
the
list
of
invalids
sultan
luckier
than
his
three
companions
had
fallen
honourably
on
the
field
of
battle
having
succumbed
to
a
sixteen
hours
run
under
the
weight
of
his
gigantic
master
who
never
for
a
moment
lost
courage
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
dead
bodies
of
his
finest
and
most
faithful
servitors
lay
heaped
around
him
the
baron
following
the
example
of
the
romans
who
exhausted
the
resources
of
military
art
against
the
carthaginians
who
were
for
ever
as
enemies
the
baron
i
repeat
changed
his
tactics
and
tried
what
battues
could
accomplish
he
called
on
all
available
men
among
the
peasants
and
beat
up
the
game
throughout
the
forest
with
such
a
formidable
number
of
men
that
not
so
much
as
a
hare
was
left
in
its
form
near
any
spot
which
they
had
passed
but
thibault
made
it
his
business
to
find
out
beforehand
where
these
battues
were
going
to
take
place
and
if
he
ascertained
that
the
beaters
were
on
the
side
of
the
forest
towards
viviers
or
soucy
he
and
his
wolves
made
an
excursion
to
boursonnes
or
yvors
and
if
the
baron
and
his
men
were
busy
near
haramont
or
longpré
the
people
of
corcy
and
vertefeuille
were
made
painfully
aware
of
thibault
and
his
wolves
in
vain
the
lord
of
vez
drew
his
cordon
at
night
round
the
suspected
enclosures
so
as
to
begin
the
attack
with
daylight
never
once
did
his
men
succeed
in
starting
a
wolf
for
not
once
did
thibault
make
a
mistake
in
his
calculations
if
by
chance
he
had
not
been
well
informed
and
was
uncertain
in
what
direction
the
baron
and
his
men
were
going
he
called
all
his
wolves
together
sending
express
couriers
after
them
as
the
night
set
in
he
then
led
them
unobserved
down
the
wooded
lane
leading
to
abbesse
which
at
that
time
ran
between
the
forest
of
compiègne
and
the
forest
of
and
so
was
able
to
pass
from
one
to
the
other
this
state
of
things
went
on
for
several
months
both
the
baron
and
thibault
carried
out
the
task
each
had
set
before
himself
with
equally
passionate
energy
the
latter
like
his
adversary
seemed
to
have
required
some
supernatural
power
whereby
he
was
able
to
resist
fatigue
and
excitement
and
this
was
the
more
remarkable
seeing
that
during
the
short
intervals
of
respite
accorded
by
the
lord
of
vez
the
was
by
no
means
at
peace
in
himself
it
was
not
that
the
terrible
deeds
in
which
he
was
an
active
agent
and
at
which
he
presided
filled
him
exactly
with
horror
for
he
thought
them
justifiable
he
threw
the
responsibility
of
them
he
said
on
to
those
who
had
forced
him
to
commit
them
but
there
were
moments
of
failing
spirit
for
which
he
could
not
account
when
he
went
about
in
the
midst
of
his
ferocious
companions
feeling
gloomy
morose
and
heavy
hearted
again
the
image
of
agnelette
would
rise
before
him
seeming
to
him
like
the
personification
of
his
own
past
life
honest
and
laborious
peaceful
and
innocent
and
more
than
that
he
felt
he
loved
her
more
than
he
had
ever
thought
it
possible
for
him
to
love
anybody
at
times
he
would
weep
at
the
thought
of
all
his
lost
happiness
at
others
he
was
seized
with
a
wild
fit
of
jealousy
against
the
one
to
whom
she
now
belonged
she
who
at
one
time
might
if
he
had
liked
have
been
his
one
day
the
baron
in
order
to
prepare
some
fresh
means
of
destruction
had
been
forced
for
the
while
to
leave
the
wolves
in
peace
thibault
who
was
in
one
of
the
moods
we
have
just
described
wandered
forth
from
the
den
where
he
lived
in
company
with
the
wolves
it
was
a
splendid
summer
s
night
and
he
began
to
rove
about
the
woodlands
where
the
moon
was
lighting
up
the
trunks
of
the
trees
dreaming
of
the
time
when
he
trod
the
mossy
carpet
underfoot
free
from
trouble
and
anxiety
until
at
last
the
only
happiness
which
was
now
left
him
forgetfulness
of
the
present
stole
over
his
senses
lost
in
this
sweet
dream
of
his
earlier
life
he
was
all
of
a
sudden
aroused
by
a
cry
of
distress
from
somewhere
near
at
hand
he
was
now
so
accustomed
to
such
sounds
that
ordinarily
he
would
have
paid
no
attention
to
it
but
his
heart
was
for
the
moment
softened
by
the
recollection
of
agnelette
and
he
felt
more
disposed
than
usual
to
pity
as
it
happened
also
he
was
near
the
place
where
he
had
first
seen
the
gentle
child
and
this
helped
to
awaken
his
kinder
nature
he
ran
to
the
spot
whence
the
cry
had
come
and
as
he
leaped
from
the
underwood
into
the
deep
near
ham
he
saw
a
woman
struggling
with
an
immense
wolf
which
had
thrown
her
on
the
ground
thibault
could
not
have
said
why
he
was
so
agitated
at
this
sight
nor
why
his
heart
beat
more
violently
than
usual
he
rushed
forward
and
seizing
the
animal
by
the
throat
hurled
it
away
from
its
victim
and
then
lifting
the
woman
in
his
arms
he
carried
her
to
the
side
of
the
lane
and
laid
her
on
the
slope
here
a
ray
of
moonlight
breaking
through
the
clouds
fell
on
the
face
of
the
woman
he
had
saved
and
thibault
saw
that
it
was
agnelette
near
to
the
spot
was
the
spring
in
which
thibault
had
once
gazed
at
himself
and
had
seen
the
first
red
hair
he
ran
to
it
took
up
water
in
his
hands
and
threw
it
into
the
woman
s
face
agnelette
opened
her
eyes
gave
a
cry
of
terror
and
tried
to
rise
and
flee
what
cried
the
as
if
he
were
still
thibault
the
you
do
not
know
me
again
agnelette
ah
yes
indeed
i
know
you
thibault
and
it
is
because
i
know
who
you
are
cried
the
young
woman
that
i
am
afraid
then
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
and
clasping
her
hands
oh
do
not
kill
me
thibault
she
cried
do
not
kill
me
it
would
be
such
dreadful
trouble
for
the
poor
old
grandmother
thibault
do
not
kill
me
the
stood
overcome
with
consternation
up
to
this
hour
he
had
not
fully
realised
the
hideous
renown
which
he
had
gained
but
the
terror
which
the
sight
of
him
inspired
in
the
woman
who
had
loved
him
and
whom
he
still
loved
filled
him
with
a
horror
of
himself
i
kill
you
agnelette
he
said
just
when
i
have
snatched
you
from
death
oh
how
you
must
hate
and
despise
me
for
such
a
thought
to
enter
your
i
do
not
hate
you
thibault
said
the
young
woman
but
i
hear
such
things
about
you
that
i
feel
afraid
of
and
do
they
say
nothing
of
the
infidelity
which
has
led
thibault
to
commit
such
crimes
i
do
not
understand
you
said
agnelette
looking
at
thibault
with
her
large
eyes
blue
as
the
heavens
what
exclaimed
thibault
you
do
not
understand
that
i
loved
you
that
i
adored
you
agnelette
and
that
the
loss
of
you
sent
me
out
of
my
mind
if
you
loved
me
if
you
adored
me
thibault
what
prevented
you
from
marrying
me
the
spirit
of
evil
muttered
thibault
i
too
loved
you
continued
the
young
woman
and
i
suffered
cruelly
waiting
for
thibault
heaved
a
sigh
you
loved
me
agnelette
he
asked
yes
replied
the
young
woman
with
her
soft
voice
and
gentle
eyes
but
now
all
is
over
said
thibault
and
you
love
me
no
thibault
answered
agnelette
i
no
longer
love
you
because
it
is
no
longer
right
to
love
you
but
one
can
not
always
forget
one
s
first
love
as
one
would
agnelette
cried
thibault
trembling
all
over
be
careful
what
you
say
why
should
i
be
careful
what
i
say
since
it
is
the
truth
said
the
girl
with
an
innocent
shake
of
the
head
the
day
you
told
me
that
you
wished
to
make
me
your
wife
i
believed
you
thibault
for
why
should
i
think
that
you
would
lie
to
me
when
i
had
just
done
you
a
service
then
later
i
met
you
but
i
did
not
go
in
search
of
you
you
came
to
me
you
spoke
words
of
love
to
me
you
were
the
first
to
refer
to
the
promise
that
you
had
made
me
and
it
was
not
my
fault
either
thibault
that
i
was
afraid
of
that
ring
which
you
wore
which
was
large
enough
for
you
and
yet
oh
it
was
horrible
not
big
enough
for
one
of
my
would
you
like
me
not
to
wear
this
ring
any
more
said
thibault
would
you
like
me
to
throw
it
away
and
he
began
trying
to
pull
it
off
his
finger
but
as
it
had
been
too
small
to
go
on
agnelette
s
finger
so
now
it
was
too
small
to
be
taken
off
thibault
s
in
vain
he
struggled
with
it
and
tried
to
move
it
with
his
teeth
the
ring
seemed
rivetted
to
his
finger
for
all
eternity
thibault
saw
that
it
was
no
use
trying
to
get
rid
of
it
it
was
a
token
of
compact
between
himself
and
the
black
wolf
and
with
a
sigh
he
let
his
arms
fall
hopelessly
to
his
sides
that
day
went
on
agnelette
i
ran
away
i
know
that
i
was
wrong
to
do
so
but
i
was
no
longer
mistress
of
myself
after
seeing
that
ring
and
more
still
she
lifted
her
eyes
as
she
spoke
looking
timidly
up
at
thibault
s
hair
thibault
was
and
by
the
light
of
the
moon
agnelette
could
see
that
it
was
no
longer
a
single
hair
that
shone
red
as
the
flames
of
hell
but
that
half
the
hair
on
thibault
s
head
was
now
of
this
devil
s
colour
oh
she
exclaimed
drawing
back
thibault
thibault
what
has
happened
to
you
since
i
last
saw
you
agnelette
cried
thibault
throwing
himself
down
with
his
face
to
the
ground
and
holding
his
head
between
his
hands
i
could
not
tell
any
human
creature
not
even
a
priest
what
has
happened
to
me
since
then
but
to
agnelette
all
i
can
say
is
agnelette
agnelette
have
pity
on
me
for
i
have
been
most
unhappy
agnelette
went
up
to
him
and
took
his
hands
in
hers
you
did
love
me
then
you
did
love
me
he
cried
what
can
i
do
thibault
said
the
girl
with
the
same
sweetness
and
innocence
as
before
i
took
you
at
your
word
and
every
time
i
heard
someone
knocking
at
our
hut
door
i
thought
it
was
you
come
to
say
to
the
old
grandmother
mother
i
love
agnelette
agnelette
loves
me
will
you
give
her
to
me
for
my
wife
then
when
i
went
and
opened
the
door
and
found
that
it
was
not
you
i
used
to
go
into
a
corner
and
and
now
agnelette
now
now
she
answered
now
thibault
it
may
seem
strange
but
in
spite
of
all
the
terrible
tales
that
are
told
about
you
i
have
not
been
really
frightened
i
was
sure
that
you
could
not
wish
any
harm
to
me
and
i
was
walking
boldly
through
the
forest
when
that
dreadful
beast
from
which
you
saved
me
suddenly
sprang
upon
but
how
is
it
that
you
are
near
your
old
home
do
you
not
live
with
your
husband
we
lived
together
for
a
while
at
vez
but
there
was
no
room
there
for
the
grandmother
and
so
i
said
to
my
husband
the
grandmother
must
be
thought
of
first
i
must
go
back
to
her
when
you
wish
to
see
me
you
will
and
he
consented
to
that
arrangement
not
at
first
but
i
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
grandmother
is
seventy
years
of
age
that
if
she
were
only
to
live
another
two
or
three
years
god
grant
it
may
be
more
it
would
only
be
two
or
three
years
of
some
extra
trouble
for
us
whereas
in
all
probability
we
had
long
years
of
life
before
us
then
he
understood
that
it
was
right
to
give
to
those
that
had
but
all
the
while
that
agnelette
was
giving
this
explanation
thibault
could
think
of
nothing
but
that
the
love
she
once
had
for
him
was
not
yet
dead
so
said
thibault
you
loved
me
and
so
agnelette
you
could
love
me
again
that
is
impossible
now
because
i
belong
to
agnelette
agnelette
only
say
that
you
love
me
no
thibault
if
i
loved
you
i
should
do
everything
in
the
world
to
hide
it
from
and
why
cried
thibault
why
you
do
not
know
my
power
i
know
that
i
have
only
a
wish
or
two
left
but
with
your
help
by
combining
these
wishes
together
i
could
make
you
as
rich
as
a
queen
we
could
leave
the
country
leave
france
europe
there
are
large
countries
of
which
you
do
not
even
know
the
names
agnelette
called
america
and
india
they
are
paradises
with
blue
skies
tall
trees
and
birds
of
every
kind
agnelette
say
that
you
will
come
with
me
nobody
will
know
that
we
have
gone
off
together
nobody
will
know
where
we
are
nobody
will
know
that
we
love
one
another
nobody
will
know
even
that
we
are
fly
with
you
thibault
said
agnelette
looking
at
the
as
if
she
had
but
half
understood
what
he
said
do
you
forget
that
i
no
longer
belong
to
myself
do
you
not
know
that
i
am
married
what
does
that
matter
said
thibault
if
it
is
i
whom
you
love
and
if
we
can
live
happily
together
oh
thibault
thibault
what
are
you
saying
listen
went
on
thibault
i
am
going
to
speak
to
you
in
the
name
of
this
world
and
the
next
do
you
wish
to
save
me
agnelette
body
and
soul
if
so
do
not
resist
my
pleading
have
pity
on
me
come
with
me
let
us
go
somewhere
together
where
we
shall
no
longer
hear
these
howlings
or
breathe
this
atmosphere
of
reeking
flesh
and
if
it
scares
you
to
think
of
being
a
rich
grand
lady
somewhere
then
where
i
can
again
be
thibault
the
workman
thibault
poor
but
beloved
and
therefore
thibault
happy
in
his
hard
work
some
place
where
agnelette
will
have
no
other
husband
but
ah
thibault
i
was
ready
to
become
your
wife
and
you
scorned
me
do
not
remember
my
sins
agnelette
which
have
been
so
cruelly
thibault
another
has
done
what
you
were
not
willing
to
do
he
took
the
poor
young
girl
he
burdened
himself
with
the
poor
old
blind
woman
he
gave
a
name
to
the
one
and
bread
to
the
other
he
had
no
ambition
beyond
that
of
gaining
my
love
he
desired
no
dowry
beyond
my
marriage
vow
can
you
think
of
asking
me
to
return
evil
for
good
do
you
dare
to
suggest
that
i
should
leave
the
one
who
has
given
me
such
proof
of
his
love
for
the
one
who
has
given
me
proof
only
of
his
indifference
but
what
matter
still
agnelette
since
you
do
not
love
him
and
since
you
do
love
me
thibault
do
not
turn
and
twist
my
words
to
make
them
appear
to
say
what
they
do
not
i
said
that
i
still
preserved
my
friendship
for
you
i
never
said
that
i
did
not
love
my
husband
i
should
like
to
see
you
happy
my
friend
above
all
i
should
like
to
see
you
abjure
your
evil
ways
and
repent
of
your
sins
and
last
of
all
i
wish
that
god
may
have
mercy
upon
you
and
that
you
may
be
delivered
from
that
spirit
of
evil
of
which
you
spoke
just
now
for
this
i
pray
night
and
morning
on
my
knees
but
even
that
i
may
be
able
to
pray
for
you
i
must
keep
myself
pure
if
the
voice
that
supplicates
for
mercy
is
to
rise
to
god
s
throne
it
must
be
an
innocent
one
above
all
i
must
scrupulously
keep
the
oath
which
i
swore
at
his
on
hearing
these
decisive
words
from
agnelette
thibault
again
became
fierce
and
morose
do
you
not
know
agnelette
that
it
is
very
imprudent
of
you
to
speak
to
me
here
like
that
and
why
thibault
asked
the
young
woman
we
are
alone
here
together
it
is
dark
and
not
a
man
of
the
open
would
dare
to
come
into
the
forest
at
this
hour
and
know
the
king
is
not
more
master
in
his
kingdom
than
i
am
here
i
do
not
understand
you
thibault
i
mean
that
having
prayed
implored
and
conjured
i
can
now
you
threaten
what
i
mean
is
continued
thibault
paying
no
heed
to
agnelette
s
words
that
every
word
you
speak
does
not
excite
my
love
for
you
more
than
it
rouses
my
hatred
towards
him
in
short
i
mean
that
it
is
imprudent
of
the
lamb
to
irritate
the
wolf
when
the
lamb
is
in
the
power
of
the
i
told
you
thibault
before
that
i
started
to
walk
through
the
forest
without
any
feeling
of
fear
at
meeting
you
as
i
was
coming
to
i
felt
a
momentary
terror
remembering
involuntarily
what
i
had
heard
said
about
you
but
at
this
moment
thibault
you
will
try
in
vain
to
make
me
turn
thibault
flung
both
hands
up
to
his
head
do
not
talk
like
that
he
said
you
can
not
think
what
the
devil
is
whispering
to
me
and
what
an
effort
i
have
to
make
to
resist
his
you
may
kill
me
if
you
like
replied
agnelette
but
i
will
not
be
guilty
of
the
cowardice
which
you
ask
of
me
you
may
kill
me
but
i
shall
remain
faithful
to
my
husband
you
may
kill
me
but
i
shall
pray
to
god
to
help
him
as
i
do
not
speak
his
name
agnelette
do
not
make
me
think
about
that
you
can
threaten
me
as
much
as
you
like
thibault
for
i
am
in
your
hands
but
happily
he
is
far
from
you
and
you
have
no
power
over
and
who
told
you
that
agnelette
do
you
not
know
that
thanks
to
the
diabolical
power
i
possess
and
which
i
can
hardly
fight
against
i
am
able
to
strike
as
well
far
as
near
and
if
i
should
become
a
widow
thibault
do
you
imagine
that
i
should
be
vile
enough
to
accept
your
hand
when
it
was
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
one
whose
name
i
bear
agnelette
said
thibault
falling
on
his
knees
agnelette
save
me
from
committing
a
further
it
is
you
not
i
who
will
be
responsible
for
the
crime
i
can
give
you
my
life
thibault
but
not
my
oh
roared
thibault
love
flies
from
the
heart
when
hatred
enters
take
care
agnelette
take
heed
to
your
husband
the
devil
is
in
me
and
he
will
soon
speak
through
my
mouth
instead
of
the
consolation
which
i
had
hoped
from
your
love
and
which
your
love
refuses
i
will
have
vengeance
stay
my
hand
agnelette
there
is
yet
time
stay
it
from
cursing
from
destroying
if
not
understand
that
it
is
not
i
but
you
who
strike
him
dead
agnelette
you
know
now
agnelette
you
do
not
stop
me
from
speaking
let
it
be
so
then
and
let
the
curse
fall
on
all
three
of
us
you
and
him
and
me
agnelette
i
wish
your
husband
to
die
and
he
will
die
agnelette
uttered
a
terrible
cry
then
as
if
her
reason
reasserted
itself
protesting
against
this
murder
at
a
distance
which
seemed
impossible
to
her
she
exclaimed
no
no
you
only
say
that
to
terrify
me
but
my
prayers
will
prevail
against
your
go
then
and
learn
how
heaven
answers
your
prayers
only
if
you
wish
to
see
your
husband
again
alive
agnelette
you
had
better
make
haste
or
you
will
but
stumble
against
his
dead
overcome
by
the
tone
of
conviction
with
which
these
last
words
were
pronounced
and
yielding
to
an
irresistible
feeling
of
terror
agnelette
without
responding
to
thibault
who
stood
on
the
further
side
of
the
lane
with
his
hand
held
out
and
pointing
towards
préciamont
set
off
running
in
the
direction
which
it
seemed
to
indicate
and
soon
disappeared
into
the
night
as
she
turned
out
of
sight
at
the
corner
of
the
road
as
she
passed
from
his
view
thibault
uttered
a
howl
which
might
have
been
taken
for
the
howling
of
a
whole
pack
of
wolves
and
plunging
into
the
thicket
ah
now
he
cried
aloud
to
himself
i
am
indeed
a
lost
and
accursed
soul
chapter
xxii
thibault
s
last
wish
urged
in
her
flight
by
a
hideous
terror
and
anxious
to
reach
the
village
where
she
had
left
her
husband
with
all
speed
possible
agnelette
for
the
very
reason
that
she
was
running
so
hastily
was
forced
by
her
failing
breath
to
pause
at
intervals
along
the
way
during
these
short
spaces
of
rest
she
endeavoured
to
reason
with
herself
trying
to
convince
herself
of
the
folly
of
attaching
importance
to
words
which
could
have
no
power
in
themselves
and
which
were
dictated
by
jealousy
and
hatred
words
which
had
by
now
been
scattered
to
the
winds
but
notwithstanding
all
her
mental
arguments
she
had
no
sooner
regained
her
breath
than
she
started
off
again
at
the
same
precipitate
pace
for
she
felt
she
should
know
no
peace
until
she
had
seen
her
husband
again
best
part
of
her
way
led
through
the
forest
and
near
the
wildest
and
most
solitary
enclosures
but
she
gave
no
thought
to
the
wolves
which
were
the
terror
of
every
town
and
village
within
ten
miles
round
only
one
fear
possessed
her
that
of
coming
across
her
husband
s
dead
body
more
than
once
as
her
foot
struck
against
a
stone
or
a
branch
her
heart
stopped
beating
and
she
felt
as
if
her
last
breath
had
been
drawn
while
a
sharp
cold
seemed
to
enter
her
very
vitals
her
hair
stood
on
end
and
her
face
grew
wet
with
perspiration
at
last
at
the
end
of
the
long
path
she
had
been
traversing
arched
over
by
the
trees
she
saw
ahead
of
her
a
vista
of
open
country
lying
bathed
in
the
soft
silver
light
of
the
moon
as
she
emerged
from
the
gloom
into
the
light
a
man
who
had
been
concealed
behind
a
bush
in
the
hollow
lying
between
the
forest
and
the
open
country
sprang
in
front
of
her
and
took
her
in
his
arms
ah
ah
he
said
laughing
and
where
are
you
off
to
madame
at
this
hour
of
the
night
and
at
this
pace
too
agnelette
recognised
her
husband
etienne
dear
dear
etienne
cried
the
young
woman
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
how
thankful
i
am
to
see
you
again
and
to
find
you
alive
and
well
oh
my
god
i
thank
thee
what
did
you
think
you
poor
little
agnelette
said
engoulevent
that
thibault
and
his
wolves
had
been
making
their
dinner
of
me
ah
do
not
even
speak
of
thibault
etienne
let
us
fly
dear
one
fly
to
where
there
are
houses
the
young
huntsman
laughed
again
well
now
then
you
will
make
all
the
gossips
of
préciamont
and
vez
declare
that
a
husband
is
of
no
use
at
all
not
even
to
restore
his
wife
s
you
are
right
etienne
but
although
i
have
just
had
the
courage
to
come
through
these
great
dreadful
woods
now
that
i
have
you
with
me
and
should
feel
reassured
i
tremble
with
fear
and
yet
i
know
not
what
has
happened
to
you
come
tell
me
all
about
it
said
etienne
giving
his
wife
a
kiss
then
agnelette
told
him
how
she
had
been
attacked
by
the
wolf
how
thibault
had
rescued
her
from
its
claws
and
what
had
passed
between
them
afterwards
engoulevent
listened
with
the
greatest
attention
listen
he
said
to
agnelette
i
am
going
to
take
you
home
and
shut
you
up
carefully
with
the
grandmother
so
that
no
harm
may
come
to
you
and
then
i
shall
ride
over
and
tell
my
lord
of
vez
where
thibault
has
taken
up
his
oh
no
no
cried
agnelette
you
would
have
to
ride
through
the
forest
and
there
is
no
knowing
what
danger
you
might
i
will
make
a
détour
said
etienne
i
can
go
round
by
croyolles
and
value
instead
of
crossing
the
agnelette
sighed
and
shook
her
head
but
made
no
further
resistance
she
knew
that
engoulevent
would
not
give
in
on
this
matter
and
she
reserved
her
strength
wherewith
to
renew
her
entreaties
when
she
was
once
indoors
and
in
truth
the
young
huntsman
only
considered
that
he
was
doing
his
duty
for
a
great
had
been
arranged
for
the
next
day
in
a
part
of
the
forest
on
the
further
side
from
that
on
which
agnelette
had
met
thibault
etienne
therefore
was
bound
to
go
without
delay
and
report
to
his
master
the
whereabouts
of
the
there
was
not
too
much
of
the
night
left
for
the
work
of
for
the
morrow
s
as
they
drew
near
préciamont
agnelette
who
had
not
spoken
for
a
while
decided
that
she
had
during
her
silence
amassed
a
sufficient
number
of
reasons
to
justify
her
in
beginning
her
solicitations
afresh
which
she
did
with
even
more
earnestness
than
she
had
put
into
her
former
arguments
she
reminded
etienne
that
thibault
even
though
he
might
be
a
had
so
far
from
hurting
her
actually
saved
her
life
and
that
after
all
he
had
not
abused
his
power
when
he
had
her
in
it
but
had
allowed
her
to
leave
him
and
rejoin
her
husband
and
after
that
to
betray
where
he
was
to
his
mortal
enemy
the
lord
of
vez
was
not
performing
a
duty
but
committing
an
act
of
treachery
and
thibault
who
would
certainly
get
wind
of
this
treachery
would
never
under
similar
circumstances
show
mercy
to
any
one
again
agnelette
became
quite
eloquent
as
she
pleaded
thibault
s
cause
but
when
marrying
engoulevent
she
had
made
no
more
secret
of
her
former
engagement
to
the
than
she
had
of
this
last
interview
with
him
and
however
perfect
a
confidence
he
had
in
his
wife
engoulevent
was
nevertheless
not
unsusceptible
to
jealousy
more
than
that
there
existed
an
old
grudge
between
the
two
men
ever
since
the
day
when
engoulevent
had
spied
out
thibault
in
his
tree
and
his
in
a
neighbouring
bush
so
he
stood
his
ground
and
though
listening
to
agnelette
continued
to
walk
briskly
towards
préciamont
and
so
arguing
together
and
each
insisting
that
he
or
she
was
in
the
right
they
came
to
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
the
first
to
protect
themselves
as
far
as
possible
from
thibault
s
sudden
and
unexpected
assaults
the
peasants
had
instituted
patrol
parties
who
mounted
guard
at
night
as
in
times
of
war
etienne
and
agnelette
were
so
with
their
discussion
that
they
did
not
hear
the
call
of
who
goes
there
from
the
sentinel
behind
the
hedge
and
went
walking
on
in
the
direction
of
the
village
the
sentinel
seeing
something
moving
in
the
darkness
which
to
his
prepossessed
imagination
appeared
to
be
a
monstrous
form
of
some
kind
and
hearing
no
answer
to
his
challenge
he
prepared
to
shoot
looking
up
at
that
moment
the
young
huntsman
suddenly
caught
sight
of
the
sentinel
as
the
moonlight
shone
on
the
barrel
of
his
gun
calling
out
friend
he
threw
himself
in
front
of
agnelette
flinging
his
arms
round
her
so
as
to
make
a
shield
of
his
body
but
at
the
same
instant
the
gun
went
off
and
the
unfortunate
etienne
giving
one
last
sigh
fell
forward
without
a
groan
against
the
wife
he
was
clasping
in
his
arms
the
bullet
had
pierced
his
heart
when
the
people
of
préciamont
on
hearing
the
gun
shot
came
running
up
to
the
spot
they
found
engoulevent
dead
and
agnelette
lying
unconscious
beside
her
husband
they
carried
her
to
her
grandmother
s
but
she
only
came
to
her
senses
to
fall
into
a
state
of
despair
which
bordered
on
delirium
and
which
at
last
became
almost
madness
she
accused
herself
of
her
husband
s
death
called
him
by
name
begged
the
invisible
spirits
which
seemed
to
haunt
her
even
in
the
short
intervals
of
slumber
which
her
excited
state
of
brain
made
possible
to
have
mercy
upon
him
she
called
thibault
s
name
and
addressed
such
heartbroken
supplications
to
him
that
those
about
her
were
moved
to
tears
by
degrees
in
spite
of
the
incoherence
of
her
words
the
real
facts
became
evident
and
it
grew
to
be
generally
understood
that
the
was
in
some
way
accountable
for
the
unhappy
accident
which
had
caused
poor
etienne
s
death
the
common
enemy
was
therefore
accused
of
having
cast
a
spell
over
the
two
unfortunate
young
creatures
and
the
animosity
felt
towards
the
former
became
intensified
in
vain
doctors
were
sent
for
from
and
agnelette
became
worse
and
worse
her
strength
was
rapidly
failing
her
voice
after
the
first
few
days
grew
feebler
her
breath
shorter
although
her
delirium
was
as
violent
as
ever
and
everything
even
the
silence
on
the
doctors
part
led
to
the
belief
that
poor
agnelette
would
soon
follow
her
husband
to
the
grave
the
voice
of
the
old
blind
woman
alone
seemed
to
have
any
power
to
allay
the
fever
when
she
heard
her
grandmother
speaking
she
grew
calmer
the
haggard
staring
eyes
grew
softer
and
suffused
with
tears
she
would
pass
her
hand
over
her
forehead
as
if
to
drive
away
some
haunting
thought
and
a
sorrowful
wandering
smile
would
pass
across
her
lips
one
evening
towards
night
her
slumber
seemed
to
be
more
agitated
and
distressed
than
usual
the
hut
feebly
lit
by
a
little
copper
lamp
was
in
the
grandmother
sat
by
the
hearth
with
that
immobility
of
countenance
under
which
peasants
and
savages
hide
their
strongest
feelings
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
on
which
agnelette
lay
so
worn
and
white
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
regular
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
with
its
troubled
breathing
you
might
have
taken
her
for
dead
knelt
one
of
the
women
whom
the
baron
was
paying
to
attend
upon
the
widow
of
his
young
huntsman
engaged
in
telling
her
beads
the
other
was
silently
spinning
with
her
distaff
all
at
once
the
sick
woman
who
for
some
minutes
past
had
been
shivering
at
intervals
seemed
to
be
fighting
against
some
horrible
dream
and
gave
a
piercing
cry
of
anguish
at
that
moment
the
door
burst
open
a
man
seemingly
encircled
by
flames
rushed
into
the
room
leapt
to
agnelette
s
bed
clasped
the
dying
woman
in
his
arms
pressed
his
lips
upon
her
forehead
uttering
cries
of
sorrow
then
rushing
to
another
door
which
gave
on
to
the
open
country
opened
it
and
disappeared
the
apparition
had
come
and
gone
so
quickly
that
it
seemed
almost
like
an
hallucination
and
as
if
agnelette
were
endeavouring
to
repulse
some
invisible
object
as
she
cried
out
take
him
away
take
him
away
but
the
two
watchers
had
seen
the
man
and
had
recognised
thibault
and
there
was
a
clamouring
outside
in
the
midst
of
which
the
name
of
thibault
could
be
distinguished
soon
the
clamour
came
nearer
to
agnelette
s
hut
and
those
who
were
uttering
the
cries
ere
long
appeared
on
the
threshold
they
were
in
pursuit
of
the
thibault
had
been
seen
prowling
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
hut
and
the
villagers
warned
of
this
by
their
sentinels
had
armed
themselves
with
and
sticks
preparatory
to
giving
him
chase
thibault
hearing
of
the
hopeless
condition
in
which
agnelette
was
had
not
been
able
to
resist
his
longing
to
see
her
once
again
and
at
the
risk
of
what
might
happen
to
him
he
had
passed
through
the
village
trusting
to
the
rapidity
of
his
movements
had
opened
the
door
of
the
hut
and
rushed
in
to
see
the
dying
woman
the
two
women
showed
the
peasants
the
door
by
which
thibault
had
escaped
and
like
a
pack
that
has
recovered
the
scent
they
started
afresh
on
his
track
with
renewed
cries
and
threats
thibault
it
need
hardly
be
said
escaped
from
them
and
disappeared
in
the
forest
agnelette
s
condition
after
the
terrible
shock
given
her
by
thibault
s
presence
and
embrace
became
so
alarming
that
before
the
night
was
over
the
priest
was
sent
for
she
had
evidently
now
but
a
few
hours
longer
to
live
and
suffer
towards
midnight
the
priest
arrived
followed
by
the
sacristan
carrying
the
cross
and
the
bearing
the
holy
water
these
went
and
knelt
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
while
the
priest
took
his
place
at
the
head
beside
agnelette
and
now
some
mysterious
power
seemed
to
the
dying
woman
for
a
long
time
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
with
the
priest
and
as
the
poor
child
had
no
need
of
long
prayers
for
herself
it
was
certain
that
she
must
be
praying
for
another
and
who
was
that
other
god
the
priest
and
agnelette
alone
knew
chapter
xxiii
the
anniversary
as
soon
as
thibault
ceased
to
hear
the
furious
cries
of
his
pursuers
behind
him
he
slackened
his
pace
and
the
usual
silence
again
reigning
throughout
the
forest
he
paused
and
sat
down
on
a
heap
of
stones
he
was
in
such
a
troubled
state
of
mind
that
he
did
not
recognise
where
he
was
until
he
began
to
notice
that
some
of
the
stones
were
blackened
as
if
they
had
been
licked
by
flames
they
were
the
stones
of
his
own
former
hearth
chance
had
led
him
to
the
spot
where
a
few
months
previously
his
hut
had
stood
the
evidently
felt
the
bitterness
of
the
comparison
between
that
peaceful
past
and
this
terrible
present
for
large
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
fell
upon
the
cinders
at
his
feet
he
heard
midnight
strike
from
the
oigny
church
clock
then
one
after
the
other
from
the
other
neighbouring
village
towers
at
this
moment
the
priest
was
listening
to
agnelette
s
dying
prayers
cursed
be
the
day
cried
thibault
when
i
first
wished
for
anything
beyond
what
god
chooses
to
put
within
the
reach
of
a
poor
workman
cursed
be
the
day
when
the
black
wolf
gave
me
the
power
to
do
evil
for
the
ill
that
i
have
done
instead
of
adding
to
my
happiness
has
destroyed
it
for
ever
a
loud
laugh
was
heard
behind
thibault
s
back
he
turned
there
was
the
black
wolf
himself
creeping
noiselessly
along
like
a
dog
coming
to
rejoin
its
master
the
wolf
would
have
been
invisible
in
the
gloom
but
for
the
flames
shot
forth
from
his
eyes
which
illuminated
the
darkness
he
went
round
the
hearth
and
sat
down
facing
the
what
is
this
he
said
master
thibault
not
satisfied
it
seems
that
master
thibault
is
difficult
to
how
can
i
feel
satisfied
said
thibault
i
who
since
i
first
met
you
have
known
nothing
but
vain
aspirations
and
endless
regrets
i
wished
for
riches
and
here
i
am
in
despair
at
having
lost
the
humble
roof
of
bracken
under
shelter
of
which
i
could
sleep
in
peace
without
anxiety
as
to
the
morrow
without
troubling
myself
about
the
rain
or
the
wind
beating
against
the
branches
of
the
giant
oaks
i
wished
for
position
and
here
i
am
stoned
and
hunted
down
by
the
lowest
peasants
whom
formerly
i
despised
i
asked
for
love
and
the
only
woman
who
loved
me
and
whom
i
loved
became
the
wife
of
another
and
she
is
at
this
moment
cursing
me
as
she
lies
dying
while
i
notwithstanding
all
the
power
you
have
given
me
can
do
nothing
to
help
her
leave
off
loving
anybody
but
yourself
oh
yes
laugh
at
me
do
i
am
not
laughing
at
you
but
did
you
not
cast
envious
eyes
on
other
people
s
property
before
you
had
set
eyes
on
me
yes
for
a
wretched
buck
of
which
there
are
hundreds
just
as
good
browsing
in
the
forest
you
thought
your
wishes
were
going
to
stop
at
the
buck
thibault
but
wishes
lead
on
to
one
another
as
the
night
to
the
day
and
the
day
to
night
when
you
wished
for
the
buck
you
also
wished
for
the
silver
dish
on
which
it
would
be
served
the
silver
dish
led
you
on
to
wish
for
the
servant
who
carries
it
and
for
the
carver
who
cuts
up
its
contents
ambition
is
like
the
vault
of
heaven
it
appears
to
be
bounded
by
the
horizon
but
it
covers
the
whole
earth
you
disdained
agnelette
s
innocence
and
went
after
madame
poulet
s
mill
if
you
had
gained
the
mill
you
would
immediately
have
wanted
the
house
of
the
bailiff
magloire
and
his
house
would
have
had
no
further
attraction
for
you
when
once
you
had
seen
the
castle
of
you
are
one
in
your
envious
disposition
with
the
fallen
angel
your
master
and
mine
only
as
you
were
not
clever
enough
to
reap
the
benefit
that
might
have
accrued
to
you
from
your
power
of
inflicting
evil
it
would
perhaps
have
been
more
to
your
interest
to
continue
to
lead
an
honest
yes
indeed
replied
the
i
feel
the
truth
of
the
proverb
evil
to
him
who
evil
wishes
but
he
continued
can
i
not
become
an
honest
man
again
the
wolf
gave
a
mocking
chuckle
my
good
fellow
the
devil
can
drag
a
man
to
hell
he
said
by
a
single
hair
have
you
ever
counted
how
many
of
yours
now
belong
to
him
i
can
not
tell
you
that
exactly
either
but
i
know
how
many
you
have
which
are
still
your
own
you
have
one
left
you
see
it
is
long
past
the
time
for
but
if
a
man
is
lost
when
but
one
of
his
hairs
belongs
to
the
devil
said
thibault
why
can
not
god
likewise
save
a
man
in
virtue
of
a
single
hair
well
try
if
that
is
so
and
besides
when
i
concluded
that
unhappy
bargain
with
you
i
did
not
understand
that
it
was
to
be
a
compact
of
this
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
the
bad
faith
of
you
men
was
it
no
compact
then
to
consent
to
give
me
your
hairs
you
stupid
fool
since
men
invented
baptism
we
do
not
know
how
to
get
hold
of
them
and
so
in
return
for
any
concessions
we
make
them
we
are
bound
to
insist
on
their
relinquishing
to
us
some
part
of
their
body
on
which
we
can
lay
hands
you
gave
us
the
hairs
of
your
head
they
are
firmly
rooted
as
you
have
proved
yourself
and
will
not
come
away
in
our
grasp
no
no
thibault
you
have
belonged
to
us
ever
since
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
that
was
once
there
you
cherished
within
you
thoughts
of
deceit
and
and
so
cried
thibault
passionately
rising
and
stamping
his
foot
and
so
i
am
lost
as
regards
the
next
world
without
having
enjoyed
the
pleasures
of
this
you
can
yet
enjoy
and
how
i
by
boldly
following
the
path
that
you
have
struck
by
chance
and
resolutely
determining
on
a
course
of
conduct
which
you
have
adopted
as
yet
only
in
a
halfhearted
way
in
short
by
frankly
owning
yourself
to
be
one
of
and
how
am
i
to
do
this
take
my
and
what
then
you
will
then
acquire
my
power
and
you
will
have
nothing
left
to
wish
if
your
power
is
so
great
if
it
can
give
you
all
the
riches
that
i
long
for
why
do
you
give
it
up
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
me
the
master
for
whom
i
shall
have
won
a
retainer
will
liberally
reward
and
if
i
take
your
place
shall
i
also
have
to
take
your
form
yes
in
the
by
day
you
will
be
a
man
the
nights
are
long
dark
full
of
snares
i
may
be
brought
down
by
a
bullet
from
a
keeper
or
be
caught
in
a
trap
and
then
riches
position
and
not
so
for
this
skin
that
covers
me
is
impenetrable
by
iron
lead
or
steel
as
long
as
it
protects
your
body
you
will
be
not
only
invulnerable
but
immortal
once
a
year
like
all
you
will
become
a
wolf
again
for
four
and
twenty
hours
and
during
that
interval
you
will
be
in
danger
of
death
like
any
other
animal
i
had
just
reached
that
dangerous
time
a
year
ago
when
we
first
ah
said
thibault
that
explains
why
you
feared
my
lord
baron
s
when
we
have
dealings
with
men
we
are
forbidden
to
speak
anything
but
the
truth
and
the
whole
truth
it
is
for
them
to
accept
or
you
have
boasted
to
me
of
the
power
that
i
should
acquire
tell
me
now
in
what
that
power
will
consist
it
will
be
such
that
even
the
most
powerful
king
will
not
be
able
to
withstand
it
since
his
power
is
limited
by
the
human
and
the
shall
i
be
rich
so
rich
that
you
will
come
in
time
to
despise
riches
since
by
the
mere
force
of
your
will
you
will
obtain
not
only
what
men
can
only
acquire
with
gold
and
silver
but
also
all
that
superior
beings
get
by
their
shall
i
be
able
to
revenge
myself
on
my
enemies
you
will
have
unlimited
power
over
everything
which
is
connected
with
if
i
love
a
woman
will
there
again
be
a
possibility
of
my
losing
her
as
you
will
have
dominion
over
all
your
fellow
creatures
you
will
be
able
to
do
with
them
what
you
there
will
be
no
power
to
enable
them
to
escape
from
the
trammels
of
my
will
nothing
except
death
which
is
stronger
than
and
i
shall
only
run
the
risk
of
death
myself
on
one
day
out
of
the
three
hundred
and
on
one
day
only
during
the
remaining
days
nothing
can
harm
you
neither
iron
lead
nor
steel
neither
water
nor
and
there
is
no
deceit
no
trap
to
catch
me
in
your
words
none
on
my
honour
as
a
wolf
good
said
thibault
then
let
it
be
so
a
wolf
for
four
and
twenty
hours
for
the
rest
of
the
time
the
monarch
of
creation
what
am
i
to
do
i
am
pick
a
tear
it
in
three
pieces
with
your
teeth
and
throw
it
away
from
you
as
far
as
you
thibault
did
as
he
was
commanded
having
torn
the
leaf
in
three
pieces
he
scattered
them
on
the
air
and
although
the
night
till
then
had
been
a
peaceful
one
there
was
immediately
heard
a
loud
peal
of
thunder
while
a
tempestuous
whirlwind
arose
which
caught
up
the
fragments
and
carried
them
whirling
away
with
it
and
now
brother
thibault
said
the
wolf
take
my
place
and
good
luck
be
with
you
as
was
my
case
just
a
year
ago
so
you
will
have
to
become
a
wolf
for
four
and
twenty
hours
you
must
endeavour
to
come
out
of
the
ordeal
as
happily
as
i
did
thanks
to
you
and
then
you
will
see
realised
all
that
i
have
promised
you
meanwhile
i
will
pray
the
lord
of
the
cloven
hoof
that
he
will
protect
you
from
the
teeth
of
the
baron
s
hounds
for
by
the
devil
himself
i
take
a
genuine
interest
in
you
friend
and
then
it
seemed
to
thibault
that
he
saw
the
black
wolf
grow
larger
and
taller
that
it
stood
up
on
its
hind
legs
and
finally
walked
away
in
the
form
of
a
man
who
made
a
sign
to
him
with
his
hand
as
he
disappeared
we
say
seemed
to
for
thibault
s
ideas
for
a
second
or
two
became
very
indistinct
a
feeling
of
torpor
passed
over
him
paralysing
his
power
of
thought
when
he
came
to
himself
he
was
alone
his
limbs
were
imprisoned
in
a
new
and
unusual
form
he
had
in
short
become
in
every
respect
the
counterpart
of
the
black
wolf
that
a
few
minutes
before
had
been
speaking
to
him
one
single
white
hair
on
his
head
alone
shone
in
contrast
to
the
remainder
of
the
sombre
coloured
fur
this
one
white
hair
of
the
wolf
was
the
one
black
hair
which
had
remained
to
the
man
thibault
had
scarcely
had
time
to
recover
himself
when
he
fancied
he
heard
a
rustling
among
the
bushes
and
the
sound
of
a
low
muffled
bark
he
thought
of
the
baron
and
his
hounds
and
trembled
thus
metamorphosed
into
the
black
wolf
he
decided
that
he
would
not
do
what
his
predecessor
had
done
and
wait
till
the
dogs
were
upon
him
it
was
probably
a
bloodhound
he
had
heard
and
he
would
get
away
before
the
hounds
were
uncoupled
he
made
off
striking
straight
ahead
as
is
the
manner
of
wolves
and
it
was
a
profound
satisfaction
to
him
to
find
that
in
his
new
form
he
had
tenfold
his
former
strength
and
elasticity
of
limb
by
the
devil
and
his
horns
the
voice
of
the
lord
of
vez
was
now
heard
to
say
to
his
new
huntsman
a
few
paces
off
you
hold
the
leash
too
slack
my
lad
you
have
let
the
bloodhound
give
tongue
and
we
shall
never
head
the
wolf
back
i
was
in
fault
i
do
not
deny
it
my
lord
but
as
i
saw
it
go
by
last
evening
only
a
few
yards
from
this
spot
i
never
guessed
that
it
would
take
up
its
quarters
for
the
night
in
this
part
of
the
wood
and
that
it
was
so
close
to
us
as
all
are
you
sure
it
is
the
same
one
that
has
got
away
from
us
so
often
may
the
bread
i
eat
in
your
service
choke
me
my
lord
if
it
is
not
the
same
black
wolf
that
we
were
chasing
last
year
when
poor
marcotte
was
i
should
like
finely
to
put
the
dogs
on
its
track
said
the
baron
with
a
sigh
my
lord
has
but
to
give
the
order
and
we
will
do
so
but
he
will
allow
me
to
observe
that
we
have
still
two
good
hours
of
darkness
before
us
time
enough
for
every
horse
we
have
to
break
its
that
may
be
but
if
we
wait
for
the
day
l
eveillé
the
fellow
will
have
had
time
to
get
ten
leagues
ten
leagues
at
least
said
l
eveillé
shaking
his
head
i
have
got
this
cursed
black
wolf
on
my
brain
added
the
baron
and
i
have
such
a
longing
to
have
its
skin
that
i
feel
sure
i
shall
catch
an
illness
if
i
do
not
get
hold
of
well
then
my
lord
let
us
have
the
dogs
out
without
a
moment
s
loss
of
you
are
right
l
eveillé
go
and
fetch
the
l
eveillé
went
back
to
his
horse
that
he
had
tied
to
a
tree
outside
the
wood
and
went
off
at
a
gallop
and
in
ten
minutes
time
which
seemed
like
ten
centuries
to
the
baron
he
was
back
with
the
whole
hunting
train
the
hounds
were
immediately
uncoupled
gently
gently
my
lads
said
the
lord
of
vez
you
forget
you
are
not
handling
your
old
dogs
if
you
get
excited
with
these
raw
recruits
they
ll
merely
kick
up
a
devil
of
a
row
and
be
no
more
good
than
so
many
turnspits
let
em
get
warmed
up
by
and
indeed
the
dogs
were
no
sooner
loose
than
two
or
three
got
at
once
on
to
the
scent
of
the
and
began
to
give
cry
whereupon
the
others
joined
them
the
whole
pack
started
off
on
thibault
s
track
at
first
quietly
following
up
the
scent
and
only
giving
cry
at
long
intervals
then
more
excitedly
and
of
more
accord
until
they
had
so
thoroughly
imbibed
the
odour
of
the
wolf
ahead
of
them
and
the
scent
had
become
so
strong
that
they
tore
along
baying
furiously
and
with
unparalleled
eagerness
in
the
direction
of
the
yvors
coppice
well
begun
is
half
done
cried
the
baron
you
look
after
the
relays
l
eveillé
i
want
them
ready
whenever
needed
i
will
encourage
the
dogs
and
you
be
on
the
alert
you
others
he
added
addressing
himself
to
the
younger
keepers
we
have
more
than
one
defeat
to
avenge
and
if
i
lose
this
view
halloo
through
the
fault
of
anyone
among
you
by
the
devil
and
his
horns
he
shall
be
the
dogs
quarry
in
place
of
the
wolf
after
pronouncing
these
words
of
encouragement
the
baron
put
his
horse
to
the
gallop
and
although
it
was
still
pitch
dark
and
the
ground
was
rough
he
kept
the
animal
going
at
top
speed
so
as
to
come
up
with
the
hounds
which
could
be
heard
giving
tongue
in
the
low
lands
about
chapter
xxiv
hunting
down
the
thibault
had
got
well
ahead
of
the
dogs
thanks
to
the
precaution
he
had
taken
of
making
good
his
escape
at
the
first
note
of
the
bloodhound
for
some
time
he
heard
no
further
sound
of
pursuit
but
all
at
once
like
distant
thunder
the
baying
of
the
hounds
reached
his
ears
and
he
began
to
feel
some
anxiety
he
had
been
trotting
but
he
now
went
on
at
greater
speed
and
did
not
pause
till
he
had
put
a
few
more
leagues
between
himself
and
his
enemies
then
he
stood
still
and
took
his
bearings
he
found
himself
on
the
heights
at
montaigu
he
bent
his
head
and
listened
the
dogs
still
seemed
a
long
way
off
somewhere
near
the
tillet
coppice
it
required
a
wolf
s
ear
to
distinguish
them
so
far
off
thibault
went
down
the
hill
again
as
if
to
meet
the
dogs
then
leaving
erneville
to
the
left
he
leaped
into
the
little
stream
which
rises
there
waded
down
its
course
as
far
as
grimancourt
dashed
into
the
woods
of
abbesse
and
finally
gained
the
forest
of
compiègne
he
was
somewhat
reassured
to
find
that
in
spite
of
his
three
hours
hard
running
the
muscles
of
his
wolf
legs
were
not
in
the
least
fatigued
he
hesitated
however
to
trust
himself
in
a
forest
which
was
not
so
familiar
to
him
as
that
of
after
another
dash
of
a
mile
or
so
he
decided
that
by
doubling
boldly
he
would
be
most
likely
to
put
the
dogs
off
the
scent
he
crossed
at
a
gallop
all
the
stretch
of
plain
between
pierrefond
and
took
to
the
woods
at
the
champ
meutard
came
out
again
at
vauvaudrand
regained
the
stream
by
the
sancères
timber
floatage
and
once
more
found
himself
in
the
forest
near
unfortunately
for
him
just
as
he
reached
the
end
of
the
route
du
pendu
he
came
across
another
pack
of
twenty
dogs
which
monsieur
de
montbreton
s
huntsman
was
bringing
up
as
a
relay
for
the
baron
had
sent
his
neighbour
news
of
the
chase
instantly
the
hounds
were
uncoupled
by
the
huntsman
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
wolf
for
seeing
that
the
latter
kept
its
distance
he
feared
it
would
get
too
far
ahead
if
he
waited
for
the
others
to
come
up
before
loosing
his
dogs
and
now
began
the
struggle
between
the
and
the
dogs
in
very
earnest
it
was
a
wild
chase
which
the
horses
in
spite
of
their
skilled
riders
had
great
difficulty
in
following
a
chase
over
plains
through
woods
across
heaths
pursued
at
a
headlong
pace
as
the
hunt
flew
by
it
appeared
and
disappeared
like
a
flash
of
lightning
across
a
cloud
leaving
behind
a
whirlwind
of
dust
and
a
sound
of
horns
and
cries
which
echo
had
hardly
time
to
repeat
it
rushed
over
hill
and
dale
through
torrents
and
bogs
and
over
precipices
as
if
horses
and
dogs
had
been
winged
like
hippogriffs
and
chimeras
the
baron
had
come
up
with
his
huntsmen
riding
at
their
head
and
almost
riding
on
the
tails
of
his
dogs
his
eye
flashing
his
nostrils
dilated
exciting
the
pack
with
wild
shouts
and
furious
blasts
digging
his
spurs
into
his
horse
s
sides
whenever
an
obstacle
of
any
kind
caused
it
to
hesitate
for
a
single
instant
the
black
wolf
on
his
side
still
held
on
at
the
same
rapid
pace
although
sorely
shaken
at
hearing
the
fresh
pack
in
full
pursuit
only
a
short
way
behind
him
just
as
he
had
got
back
to
the
forest
he
had
not
lost
an
inch
of
ground
as
he
retained
to
the
full
all
his
human
consciousness
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
as
he
still
ran
on
that
he
should
not
escape
in
safety
from
this
ordeal
he
felt
that
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
die
before
he
had
taken
vengeance
for
all
the
agony
that
others
made
him
suffer
before
he
had
known
those
pleasures
that
had
been
promised
him
above
all
for
at
this
critical
moment
his
thoughts
kept
on
running
on
this
before
he
had
gained
agnelette
s
love
at
moments
he
was
possessed
by
terror
at
others
by
anger
he
thought
at
times
that
he
would
turn
and
face
this
yelling
pack
of
dogs
and
forgetting
his
present
form
scatter
them
with
stones
and
blows
then
an
instant
after
feeling
mad
with
rage
deafened
by
the
the
hounds
were
ringing
in
his
ears
he
fled
he
leaped
he
flew
with
the
legs
of
a
deer
with
the
wings
of
an
eagle
but
his
efforts
were
in
vain
he
might
run
leap
almost
fly
the
sounds
of
death
still
clung
to
him
and
if
for
a
moment
they
became
more
distant
it
was
only
to
hear
them
a
moment
after
nearer
and
more
threatening
still
but
still
the
instinct
of
did
not
fail
him
and
still
his
strength
was
undiminished
only
if
by
ill
luck
he
were
to
come
across
other
relays
he
felt
that
it
might
give
way
so
he
determined
to
take
a
bold
course
so
as
to
the
dogs
and
to
get
back
to
his
lairs
where
he
knew
his
ground
and
hoped
to
evade
the
dogs
he
therefore
doubled
for
the
second
time
he
first
ran
back
to
puiseux
then
skirted
past
viviers
regained
the
forest
of
compiègne
made
a
dash
into
the
forest
of
largue
returned
and
crossed
the
aisne
at
attichy
and
finally
got
back
to
the
forest
of
at
the
low
lands
of
argent
he
trusted
in
this
way
to
baffle
the
strategical
plans
of
the
lord
of
vez
who
had
no
doubt
posted
his
dogs
at
various
likely
points
once
back
in
his
old
quarters
thibault
breathed
more
freely
he
was
now
on
the
banks
of
the
ourcq
between
norroy
and
trouennes
where
the
river
runs
at
the
foot
of
deep
rocks
on
either
side
he
leaped
up
on
to
a
crag
overhanging
the
water
and
from
this
high
vantage
ground
he
sprang
into
the
waves
below
then
swam
to
a
crevice
at
the
base
of
the
rock
from
which
he
had
leapt
which
was
situated
rather
below
the
ordinary
level
of
the
water
and
here
at
the
back
of
this
cave
he
waited
he
had
gained
at
least
three
miles
upon
the
dogs
and
yet
scarcely
another
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
when
the
whole
pack
arrived
and
stormed
the
crest
of
the
rock
those
who
were
leading
mad
with
excitement
did
not
see
the
gulf
in
front
of
them
or
else
like
their
quarry
they
thought
they
would
leap
safely
into
it
for
they
plunged
and
thibault
was
splashed
far
back
as
he
was
hidden
by
the
water
that
was
scattered
in
every
direction
as
they
fell
into
it
one
by
one
less
fortunate
however
and
less
vigorous
than
he
was
they
were
unable
to
fight
against
the
current
and
after
vainly
battling
with
it
they
were
borne
along
out
of
sight
before
they
had
even
got
scent
of
the
s
retreat
overhead
he
could
hear
the
tramping
of
the
horses
feet
the
baying
of
the
dogs
that
were
still
left
the
cries
of
men
and
above
all
these
sounds
dominating
the
other
voices
that
of
the
baron
as
he
cursed
and
swore
when
the
last
dog
had
fallen
into
the
water
and
been
carried
away
like
the
others
he
saw
thanks
to
a
bend
in
the
river
that
the
huntsmen
were
going
down
it
and
persuaded
that
the
baron
whom
he
recognised
at
the
head
of
his
would
only
do
this
with
the
intention
of
coming
up
it
again
he
determined
not
to
wait
for
this
and
left
his
now
swimming
now
leaping
with
agility
from
one
rock
to
the
other
at
times
wading
through
the
water
he
went
up
the
river
to
the
end
of
the
crêne
coppice
certain
that
he
had
now
made
a
considerable
advance
on
his
enemies
he
resolved
to
get
to
one
of
the
villages
near
and
run
in
and
out
among
the
houses
feeling
sure
that
they
would
not
think
of
coming
after
him
there
he
thought
of
préciamont
if
any
village
was
well
known
to
him
it
was
that
and
then
at
préciamont
he
would
be
near
agnelette
he
felt
that
this
neighbourhood
would
put
fresh
vigour
into
him
and
would
bring
him
good
fortune
and
that
the
gentle
image
of
the
innocent
girl
would
have
some
influence
on
his
fate
so
he
started
off
in
that
direction
it
was
now
six
o
clock
in
the
evening
the
hunt
had
lasted
nearly
fifteen
hours
and
wolf
dogs
and
huntsmen
had
covered
fifty
leagues
at
least
when
at
last
after
circling
round
by
manereux
and
oigny
the
black
wolf
reached
the
borders
of
the
heath
by
the
lane
of
ham
the
sun
was
already
beginning
to
sink
and
shedding
a
dazzling
light
over
the
flowery
plain
the
little
white
and
pink
flowers
scented
the
breeze
that
played
caressingly
around
them
the
grasshopper
was
singing
in
its
little
house
of
moss
and
the
lark
was
soaring
up
towards
heaven
saluting
the
eve
with
its
song
as
twelve
hours
before
it
had
saluted
the
morn
the
peaceful
beauty
of
nature
had
a
strange
effect
on
thibault
it
seemed
enigmatical
to
him
that
nature
could
be
so
smiling
and
beautiful
while
anguish
such
as
his
was
devouring
his
soul
he
saw
the
flowers
and
heard
the
insects
and
the
birds
and
he
compared
the
quiet
joy
of
this
innocent
world
with
the
horrible
pangs
he
was
enduring
and
asked
himself
whether
after
all
notwithstanding
all
the
new
promises
that
had
been
made
him
by
the
devil
s
envoy
he
had
acted
any
more
wisely
in
making
this
second
compact
than
he
had
in
making
the
first
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
might
not
find
himself
deceived
in
the
one
as
he
had
been
in
the
other
as
he
went
along
a
little
footpath
nearly
hidden
under
the
golden
broom
he
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
by
this
very
path
that
he
had
taken
agnelette
home
on
the
first
day
of
their
acquaintance
the
day
when
inspired
by
his
good
angel
he
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
the
thought
that
thanks
to
this
new
compact
he
might
be
able
to
recover
agnelette
s
love
revived
his
spirits
which
had
been
saddened
and
depressed
by
the
sight
of
the
universal
happiness
around
him
he
heard
the
church
bells
at
préciamont
ringing
in
the
valley
below
its
solemn
monotonous
tones
recalled
the
thought
of
his
fellow
men
to
the
black
wolf
and
of
all
he
had
to
fear
from
them
so
he
ran
boldly
on
across
the
fields
to
the
village
where
he
hoped
to
find
a
refuge
in
some
empty
building
as
he
was
skirting
the
little
stone
wall
of
the
village
cemetery
he
heard
a
sound
of
voices
approaching
along
the
road
he
was
in
he
could
not
fail
to
meet
whoever
they
might
be
who
were
coming
towards
him
if
he
himself
went
on
it
was
not
safe
to
turn
back
as
he
would
have
to
cross
some
rising
ground
whence
he
might
easily
be
seen
so
there
was
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
jump
over
the
wall
of
the
cemetery
and
with
a
bound
he
was
on
the
other
side
this
graveyard
as
usual
adjoined
the
church
it
was
uncared
for
and
overgrown
with
tall
grass
while
brambles
and
thorns
grew
rankly
in
places
the
wolf
made
for
the
thickest
of
these
bramble
bushes
he
found
a
sort
of
ruined
vault
whence
he
could
look
out
without
being
seen
and
he
crept
under
the
branches
and
hid
himself
inside
a
few
yards
away
from
him
was
a
grave
within
the
church
could
be
heard
the
chanting
of
the
priests
the
more
distinctly
that
the
vault
must
at
one
time
have
communicated
by
a
passage
with
the
crypt
presently
the
chanting
ceased
and
the
black
wolf
who
did
not
feel
quite
at
ease
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
church
and
thought
that
the
road
must
now
be
clear
decided
that
it
was
time
to
start
off
again
and
to
find
a
safer
retreat
than
the
one
he
had
fled
to
in
his
haste
but
he
had
scarcely
got
his
nose
outside
the
bramble
bush
when
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
opened
and
he
quickly
retreated
again
to
his
hole
in
great
trepidation
as
to
who
might
now
be
approaching
the
first
person
he
saw
was
a
child
dressed
in
a
white
alb
and
carrying
a
vessel
of
holy
water
he
was
followed
by
a
man
in
a
surplice
bearing
a
silver
cross
and
after
the
latter
came
a
priest
chanting
the
psalms
for
the
dead
behind
these
were
four
peasants
carrying
a
bier
covered
with
a
white
pall
over
which
were
scattered
green
branches
and
flowers
and
beneath
the
sheet
could
be
seen
the
outline
of
a
coffin
a
few
villagers
from
préciamont
wound
up
this
little
procession
although
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
such
a
sight
as
this
seeing
that
he
was
in
a
cemetery
and
that
the
grave
must
have
prepared
him
for
it
thibault
nevertheless
felt
strangely
moved
as
he
looked
on
although
the
slightest
movement
might
betray
his
presence
and
bring
destruction
upon
him
he
anxiously
watched
every
detail
of
the
ceremony
the
priest
having
blessed
the
grave
the
peasants
laid
down
their
burden
on
an
adjoining
hillock
it
is
the
custom
in
our
country
when
a
young
girl
or
young
married
woman
dies
in
the
fullness
of
her
youth
and
beauty
to
carry
her
to
the
in
an
open
coffin
with
only
a
pall
over
her
so
that
her
friends
may
bid
her
a
last
farewell
her
relations
give
her
a
last
kiss
then
the
coffin
is
nailed
down
and
all
is
over
an
old
woman
led
by
some
kind
hand
for
she
was
apparently
blind
went
up
to
the
coffin
to
give
the
dead
one
a
last
kiss
the
peasants
lifted
the
pall
from
the
still
face
and
there
lay
agnelette
a
low
groan
escaped
from
thibault
s
agonised
breast
and
mingled
with
the
tears
and
sobs
of
those
present
agnelette
as
she
lay
there
so
pale
in
death
wrapped
in
an
ineffable
calm
appeared
more
beautiful
than
when
in
life
beneath
her
wreath
of
and
daisies
as
thibault
looked
upon
the
poor
dead
girl
his
heart
seemed
suddenly
to
melt
within
him
it
was
he
as
he
had
truly
realised
who
had
really
killed
her
and
he
experienced
a
genuine
and
overpowering
sorrow
the
more
poignant
since
for
the
first
time
for
many
long
months
he
forgot
to
think
of
himself
and
thought
only
of
the
dead
woman
now
lost
to
him
for
ever
as
he
heard
the
blows
of
the
hammer
knocking
the
nails
into
the
coffin
as
he
heard
the
earth
and
stones
being
shovelled
into
the
grave
and
falling
with
a
dull
thud
on
to
the
body
of
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
a
feeling
of
giddiness
came
over
him
the
hard
stones
he
thought
must
be
bruising
agnelette
s
tender
flesh
so
fresh
and
sweet
but
a
few
days
ago
and
only
yesterday
still
throbbing
with
life
and
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
rush
out
on
the
assailants
and
snatch
away
the
body
which
dead
must
surely
belong
to
him
since
living
it
had
belonged
to
another
but
the
grief
of
the
man
overcame
this
instinct
of
the
wild
beast
at
bay
a
shudder
passed
through
the
body
hidden
beneath
its
wolf
skin
tears
fell
from
the
fierce
eyes
and
the
unhappy
man
cried
out
o
god
take
my
life
i
give
it
gladly
if
only
by
my
death
i
may
give
back
life
to
her
whom
i
have
killed
the
words
were
followed
by
such
an
appalling
howl
that
all
who
were
in
the
cemetery
fled
and
the
place
was
left
utterly
deserted
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
hounds
having
recovered
the
scent
came
leaping
in
over
the
wall
followed
by
the
baron
streaming
with
sweat
as
he
rode
his
horse
which
was
covered
with
foam
and
blood
the
dogs
made
straight
for
the
bramble
bush
and
began
worrying
something
hidden
there
halloo
halloo
halloo
cried
the
lord
of
vez
in
a
voice
of
thunder
as
he
leapt
from
his
horse
not
caring
if
there
was
anyone
or
not
to
look
after
it
and
drawing
out
his
he
dashed
towards
the
vault
forcing
his
way
through
the
hounds
he
found
them
fighting
over
a
fresh
and
bleeding
but
the
body
had
disappeared
there
was
no
mistake
as
to
its
being
the
skin
of
the
that
they
had
been
hunting
for
with
the
exception
of
one
white
hair
it
was
entirely
black
what
had
become
of
the
body
no
one
ever
knew
only
as
from
this
time
forth
thibault
was
never
seen
again
it
was
generally
believed
that
the
former
and
no
other
was
the
furthermore
as
the
skin
had
been
found
without
the
body
and
as
from
the
spot
where
it
was
found
a
peasant
reported
to
have
heard
someone
speak
the
words
o
god
take
my
life
i
give
it
gladly
if
only
by
my
death
i
may
give
back
