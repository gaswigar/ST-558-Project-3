darkly
you
sweep
on
eternal
fugitive
round
whose
bodiless
rush
stagnant
space
frets
into
eddying
bubbles
of
light
is
your
heart
lost
to
the
lover
calling
you
across
his
immeasurable
loneliness
is
the
aching
urgency
of
your
haste
the
sole
reason
why
your
tangled
tresses
break
into
stormy
riot
and
pearls
of
fire
roll
along
your
path
as
from
a
broken
necklace
your
fleeting
steps
kiss
the
dust
of
this
world
into
sweetness
sweeping
aside
all
waste
the
storm
centred
with
your
dancing
limbs
shakes
the
sacred
shower
of
death
over
life
and
freshens
her
growth
should
you
in
sudden
weariness
stop
for
a
moment
the
world
would
rumble
into
a
heap
an
encumbrance
barring
its
own
progress
and
even
the
least
speck
of
dust
would
pierce
the
sky
throughout
its
infinity
with
an
unbearable
pressure
my
thoughts
are
quickened
by
this
rhythm
of
unseen
feet
round
which
the
anklets
of
light
are
shaken
they
echo
in
the
pulse
of
my
heart
and
through
my
blood
surges
the
psalm
of
the
ancient
sea
i
hear
the
thundering
flood
tumbling
my
life
from
world
to
world
and
form
to
form
scattering
my
being
in
an
endless
spray
of
gifts
in
sorrowings
and
songs
the
tide
runs
high
the
wind
blows
the
boat
dances
like
thine
own
desire
my
heart
leave
the
hoard
on
the
shore
and
sail
over
the
unfathomed
dark
towards
limitless
light
we
came
hither
together
friend
and
now
at
the
i
stop
to
bid
you
farewell
your
path
is
wide
and
straight
before
you
but
my
call
comes
up
by
ways
from
the
unknown
i
shall
follow
wind
and
cloud
i
shall
follow
the
stars
to
where
day
breaks
behind
the
hills
i
shall
follow
lovers
who
as
they
walk
twine
their
days
into
a
wreath
on
a
single
thread
of
song
i
love
it
was
growing
dark
when
i
asked
her
what
strange
land
have
i
come
to
she
only
lowered
her
eyes
and
the
water
gurgled
in
the
throat
of
her
jar
as
she
walked
away
the
trees
hang
vaguely
over
the
bank
and
the
land
appears
as
though
it
already
belonged
to
the
past
the
water
is
dumb
the
bamboos
are
darkly
still
a
wristlet
tinkles
against
the
from
down
the
lane
row
no
more
but
fasten
the
boat
to
this
tree
for
i
love
the
look
of
this
land
the
evening
star
goes
down
behind
the
temple
dome
and
the
pallor
of
the
marble
landing
haunts
the
dark
water
belated
wayfarers
sigh
for
light
from
hidden
windows
is
splintered
into
the
darkness
by
intervening
wayside
trees
and
bushes
still
that
wristlet
tinkles
against
the
and
retreating
steps
rustle
from
down
the
lane
littered
with
leaves
the
night
deepens
the
palace
towers
loom
and
the
town
hums
wearily
row
no
more
but
fasten
the
boat
to
a
tree
let
me
seek
rest
in
this
strange
land
dimly
lying
under
the
stars
where
darkness
tingles
with
the
tinkle
of
a
wristlet
knocking
against
a
o
that
i
were
stored
with
a
secret
like
unshed
rain
in
summer
clouds
a
secret
folded
up
in
silence
that
i
could
wander
away
with
o
that
i
had
some
one
to
whisper
to
where
slow
waters
lap
under
trees
that
doze
in
the
sun
the
hush
this
evening
seems
to
expect
a
footfall
and
you
ask
me
for
the
cause
of
my
tears
i
can
not
give
a
reason
why
i
weep
for
that
is
a
secret
still
withheld
from
me
for
once
be
careless
timid
traveller
and
utterly
lose
your
way
though
you
are
be
like
broad
daylight
enticed
by
and
netted
in
mist
do
not
shun
the
garden
of
lost
hearts
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
wrong
road
where
the
grass
is
strewn
with
wrecked
red
flowers
and
disconsolate
water
heaves
in
the
troubled
sea
long
have
you
watched
over
the
store
gathered
by
weary
years
let
it
be
stripped
with
nothing
remaining
but
the
desolate
triumph
of
losing
all
two
little
bare
feet
flit
over
the
ground
and
seem
to
embody
that
metaphor
flowers
are
the
footprints
of
summer
they
lightly
impress
on
the
dust
the
chronicle
of
their
adventure
to
be
erased
by
a
passing
breeze
come
stray
into
my
heart
you
tender
little
feet
and
leave
the
everlasting
print
of
songs
on
my
dreamland
path
i
am
like
the
night
to
you
little
flower
i
can
only
give
you
peace
and
a
wakeful
silence
hidden
in
the
dark
when
in
the
morning
you
open
your
eyes
i
shall
leave
you
to
a
world
with
bees
and
songful
with
birds
my
last
gift
to
you
will
be
a
tear
dropped
into
the
depth
of
your
youth
it
will
make
your
smile
all
the
sweeter
and
bemist
your
outlook
on
the
pitiless
mirth
of
day
do
not
stand
before
my
window
with
those
hungry
eyes
and
beg
for
my
secret
it
is
but
a
tiny
stone
of
glistening
pain
streaked
with
by
passion
what
gifts
have
you
brought
in
both
hands
to
fling
before
me
in
the
dust
i
fear
if
i
accept
to
create
a
debt
that
can
never
be
paid
even
by
the
loss
of
all
i
have
do
not
stand
before
my
window
with
your
youth
and
flowers
to
shame
my
destitute
life
if
i
were
living
in
the
royal
town
of
ujjain
when
kalidas
was
the
poet
i
should
know
some
malwa
girl
and
fill
my
thoughts
with
the
music
of
her
name
she
would
glance
at
me
through
the
slanting
shadow
of
her
eyelids
and
allow
her
veil
to
catch
in
the
jasmine
as
an
excuse
for
lingering
near
me
this
very
thing
happened
in
some
past
whose
track
is
lost
under
time
dead
leaves
the
scholars
fight
about
dates
that
play
i
do
not
break
my
heart
dreaming
over
flown
and
vanished
ages
but
alas
and
alas
again
that
those
malwa
girls
have
followed
them
to
what
heaven
i
wonder
have
they
carried
in
their
those
days
that
tingled
to
the
lyrics
of
the
king
poet
this
morning
separation
from
those
whom
i
was
born
too
late
to
meet
weighs
on
and
saddens
my
heart
yet
april
carries
the
same
flowers
with
which
they
decked
their
hair
and
the
same
south
breeze
fluttered
their
veils
as
whispers
over
modern
roses
and
to
tell
the
truth
joys
are
not
lacking
to
this
spring
though
kalidas
sing
no
more
and
i
know
if
he
can
watch
me
from
the
poets
paradise
he
has
reasons
to
be
envious
be
not
concerned
about
her
heart
my
heart
leave
it
in
the
dark
what
if
her
beauty
be
of
the
figure
and
her
smile
merely
of
the
face
let
me
take
without
question
the
simple
meaning
of
her
glances
and
be
happy
i
care
not
if
it
be
a
web
of
delusion
that
her
arms
wind
about
me
for
the
web
itself
is
rich
and
rare
and
the
deceit
can
be
smiled
at
and
forgotten
be
not
concerned
about
her
heart
my
heart
be
content
if
the
music
is
true
though
the
words
are
not
to
be
believed
enjoy
the
grace
that
dances
like
a
lily
on
the
rippling
deceiving
surface
whatever
may
lie
beneath
neither
mother
nor
daughter
are
you
nor
bride
urvashi
woman
you
are
to
ravish
the
soul
of
paradise
footnote
the
dancing
girl
of
paradise
who
rose
from
the
sea
when
evening
comes
down
to
the
folds
whither
the
cattle
have
returned
you
never
trim
the
house
lamps
nor
walk
to
the
bridal
bed
with
a
tremulous
heart
and
a
wavering
smile
on
your
lips
glad
that
the
dark
hours
are
so
secret
like
the
dawn
you
are
without
veil
urvashi
and
without
shame
who
can
imagine
that
aching
overflow
of
splendour
which
created
you
you
rose
from
the
churned
ocean
on
the
first
day
of
the
first
spring
with
the
cup
of
life
in
your
right
hand
and
poison
in
your
left
the
monster
sea
lulled
like
an
enchanted
snake
laid
down
its
thousand
hoods
at
your
feet
your
unblemished
radiance
rose
from
the
foam
white
and
naked
as
a
jasmine
were
you
ever
small
timid
or
in
bud
urvashi
o
youth
everlasting
did
you
sleep
cradled
in
the
deep
blue
night
where
the
strange
light
of
gems
plays
over
coral
shells
and
moving
creatures
of
dreamlike
form
till
day
revealed
your
awful
fulness
of
bloom
adored
are
you
of
all
men
in
all
ages
urvashi
o
endless
wonder
the
world
throbs
with
youthful
pain
at
the
glance
of
your
eyes
the
ascetic
lays
the
fruit
of
his
austerities
at
your
feet
the
songs
of
poets
hum
and
swarm
round
the
perfume
of
your
presence
your
feet
as
in
careless
joy
they
flit
on
wound
even
the
heart
of
the
hollow
wind
with
the
tinkle
of
golden
bells
when
you
dance
before
the
gods
flinging
orbits
of
novel
rhythm
into
space
urvashi
the
earth
shivers
leaf
and
grass
and
autumn
fields
heave
and
sway
the
sea
surges
into
a
frenzy
of
rhyming
waves
the
stars
drop
into
the
sky
beads
from
the
chain
that
leaps
till
it
breaks
on
your
breast
and
the
blood
dances
in
men
hearts
with
sudden
turmoil
you
are
the
first
break
on
the
crest
of
heaven
slumber
urvashi
you
thrill
the
air
with
unrest
the
world
bathes
your
limbs
in
her
tears
with
colour
of
her
heart
blood
are
your
feet
red
lightly
you
poise
on
the
lotus
of
desire
urvashi
you
play
forever
in
that
limitless
mind
wherein
labours
god
tumultuous
dream
you
like
a
rivulet
swift
and
sinuous
laugh
and
dance
and
your
steps
sing
as
you
trip
along
i
like
a
bank
rugged
and
steep
stand
speechless
and
and
darkly
gaze
at
you
i
like
a
big
foolish
storm
of
a
sudden
come
rushing
on
and
try
to
rend
my
being
and
scatter
it
parcelled
in
a
whirl
of
passion
you
like
the
lightning
flash
slender
and
keen
pierce
the
heart
of
the
turbulent
darkness
to
disappear
in
a
vivid
streak
of
laughter
you
desired
my
love
and
yet
you
did
not
love
me
therefore
my
life
clings
to
you
like
a
chain
of
which
clank
and
grip
grow
harsher
the
more
you
struggle
to
be
free
my
despair
has
become
your
deadly
companion
clutching
at
the
faintest
of
your
favours
trying
to
drag
you
away
into
the
cavern
of
tears
you
have
shattered
my
freedom
and
with
its
wreck
built
your
own
prison
i
am
glad
you
will
not
wait
for
me
with
that
lingering
pity
in
your
look
it
is
only
the
spell
of
the
night
and
my
farewell
words
startled
at
their
own
tune
of
despair
which
bring
these
tears
to
my
eyes
but
day
will
dawn
my
eyes
will
dry
and
my
heart
and
there
will
be
no
time
for
weeping
who
says
it
is
hard
to
forget
the
mercy
of
death
works
at
life
core
bringing
it
respite
from
its
own
foolish
persistence
the
stormy
sea
is
lulled
at
last
in
its
rocking
cradle
the
forest
fire
falls
to
sleep
on
its
bed
of
ashes
you
and
i
shall
part
and
the
cleavage
will
be
hidden
under
living
grass
and
flowers
that
laugh
in
the
sun
of
all
days
you
have
chosen
this
one
to
visit
my
garden
but
the
storm
passed
over
my
roses
last
night
and
the
grass
is
strewn
with
torn
leaves
i
do
not
know
what
has
brought
you
now
that
the
hedges
are
laid
low
and
rills
run
in
the
walks
the
prodigal
wealth
of
spring
is
scattered
and
the
scent
and
song
of
yesterday
are
wrecked
yet
stay
a
while
let
me
find
some
remnant
flowers
though
i
doubt
if
your
skirt
can
be
filled
the
time
will
be
short
for
the
clouds
thicken
and
here
comes
the
rain
again
i
forgot
myself
for
a
moment
and
i
came
but
raise
your
eyes
and
let
me
know
if
there
still
linger
some
shadow
of
other
days
like
a
pale
cloud
on
the
horizon
that
has
been
robbed
of
its
rain
for
a
moment
bear
with
me
if
i
forget
myself
the
roses
are
still
in
bud
they
do
not
yet
know
how
we
neglect
to
gather
flowers
this
summer
the
morning
star
has
the
same
palpitating
hush
the
early
light
is
enmeshed
in
the
branches
that
overbrow
your
window
as
in
those
other
days
that
times
are
changed
i
forget
for
a
little
and
have
come
i
forget
if
you
ever
shamed
me
by
looking
away
when
i
bared
my
heart
i
only
remember
the
words
that
stranded
on
the
tremor
of
your
lips
i
remember
in
your
dark
eyes
sweeping
shadows
of
passion
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
in
the
dusk
i
forget
that
you
do
not
remember
and
i
come
the
rain
fell
fast
the
river
rushed
and
hissed
it
licked
up
and
swallowed
the
island
while
i
waited
alone
on
the
lessening
bank
with
my
sheaves
of
corn
in
a
heap
from
the
shadows
of
the
opposite
shore
the
boat
crosses
with
a
woman
at
the
helm
i
cry
to
her
come
to
my
island
coiled
round
with
hungry
water
and
take
away
my
year
harvest
she
comes
and
takes
all
that
i
have
to
the
last
grain
i
ask
her
to
take
me
but
she
says
no
the
boat
is
laden
with
my
gift
and
no
room
is
left
for
me
the
evening
beckons
and
i
would
fain
follow
the
travellers
who
sailed
in
the
last
ferry
of
the
to
cross
the
dark
some
were
for
home
some
for
the
farther
shore
yet
all
have
ventured
to
sail
but
i
sit
alone
at
the
landing
having
left
my
home
and
missed
the
boat
summer
is
gone
and
my
winter
harvest
is
lost
i
wait
for
that
love
which
gathers
failures
to
sow
them
in
tears
on
the
dark
that
they
may
bear
fruit
when
day
rises
anew
on
this
side
of
the
water
there
is
no
landing
the
girls
do
not
come
here
to
fetch
water
the
land
along
its
edge
is
shaggy
with
stunted
shrubs
a
noisy
flock
of
dig
their
nests
in
the
steep
bank
under
whose
frown
the
find
no
shelter
you
sit
there
on
the
unfrequented
grass
and
the
morning
wears
on
tell
me
what
you
do
on
this
bank
so
dry
that
it
is
agape
with
cracks
she
looks
in
my
face
and
says
nothing
nothing
whatsoever
on
this
side
of
the
river
the
bank
is
deserted
and
no
cattle
come
to
water
only
some
stray
goats
from
the
village
browse
the
scanty
grass
all
day
and
the
solitary
watches
from
an
uprooted
aslant
over
the
mud
you
sit
there
alone
in
the
miserly
shade
of
a
and
the
morning
wears
on
tell
me
for
whom
do
you
wait
she
looks
in
my
face
and
says
no
one
no
one
at
all
kacha
and
devayani
kacha
and
devayani
kacha
came
from
paradise
to
learn
the
secret
of
immortality
from
a
sage
who
taught
the
titans
and
whose
daughter
devayani
fell
in
love
with
kacha
the
time
has
come
for
me
to
take
leave
devayani
i
have
long
sat
at
your
father
feet
but
he
completed
his
teaching
graciously
allow
me
to
go
back
to
the
land
of
the
gods
whence
i
came
devayani
you
have
as
you
desired
won
that
rare
knowledge
coveted
by
the
gods
but
think
do
you
aspire
after
nothing
further
kacha
nothing
devayani
nothing
at
all
dive
into
the
bottom
of
your
heart
does
no
timid
wish
lurk
there
fearful
lest
it
be
blighted
kacha
for
me
the
sun
of
fulfilment
has
risen
and
the
stars
have
faded
in
its
light
i
have
mastered
the
knowledge
which
gives
life
devayani
then
you
must
be
the
one
happy
being
in
creation
alas
now
for
the
first
time
i
feel
what
torture
these
days
spent
in
an
alien
land
have
been
to
you
though
we
offered
you
our
best
kacha
not
so
much
bitterness
smile
and
give
me
leave
to
go
devayani
smile
but
my
friend
this
is
not
your
native
paradise
smiles
are
not
so
cheap
in
this
world
where
thirst
like
a
worm
in
the
flower
gnaws
at
the
heart
core
where
baffled
desire
hovers
round
the
desired
and
memory
never
ceases
to
sigh
foolishly
after
vanished
joy
kacha
devayani
tell
me
how
i
have
offended
devayani
is
it
so
easy
for
you
to
leave
this
forest
which
through
long
years
has
lavished
on
you
shade
and
song
do
you
not
feel
how
the
wind
wails
through
these
glimmering
shadows
and
dry
leaves
whirl
in
the
air
like
ghosts
of
lost
hope
while
you
alone
who
part
from
us
have
a
smile
on
your
lips
kacha
this
forest
has
been
a
second
mother
to
me
for
here
i
have
been
born
again
my
love
for
it
shall
never
dwindle
devayani
when
you
had
driven
the
cattle
to
graze
on
the
lawn
yonder
banyan
tree
spread
a
hospitable
shade
for
your
tired
limbs
against
the
heat
kacha
i
bow
to
thee
lord
of
the
forest
remember
me
when
under
thy
shade
other
students
chant
their
lessons
to
an
accompaniment
of
bees
humming
and
leaves
rustling
devayani
and
do
not
forget
our
venumati
whose
swift
water
is
one
stream
of
singing
love
kacha
i
shall
ever
remember
her
the
dear
companion
of
my
exile
who
like
a
busy
village
girl
smiles
on
her
errand
of
ceaseless
service
and
croons
a
simple
song
devayani
but
friend
let
me
also
remind
you
that
you
had
another
companion
whose
thoughts
were
vainly
busy
to
make
you
forget
an
exile
cares
kacha
the
memory
of
her
has
become
a
part
of
my
life
devayani
i
recall
the
day
when
little
more
than
a
boy
you
first
arrived
you
stood
there
near
the
hedge
of
the
garden
a
smile
in
your
eyes
kacha
and
i
saw
you
gathering
flowers
clad
in
white
like
the
dawn
bathed
in
radiance
and
i
said
make
me
proud
by
allowing
me
to
help
you
devayani
i
asked
in
surprise
who
you
were
and
you
meekly
answered
that
you
were
the
son
of
vrihaspati
a
divine
sage
at
the
court
of
the
god
indra
and
desired
to
learn
from
my
father
that
secret
spell
which
can
revive
the
dead
kacha
i
feared
lest
the
master
the
teacher
of
the
titans
those
rivals
of
the
gods
should
refuse
to
accept
me
for
a
disciple
devayani
but
he
could
not
refuse
me
when
i
pleaded
your
cause
so
greatly
he
loves
his
daughter
kacha
thrice
had
the
jealous
titans
slain
me
and
thrice
you
prevailed
on
your
father
to
bring
me
back
to
life
therefore
my
gratitude
can
never
die
devayani
gratitude
forget
all
i
shall
not
grieve
do
you
only
remember
benefits
let
them
perish
if
after
the
day
lessons
in
the
evening
solitude
some
strange
tremor
of
joy
shook
your
heart
remember
that
but
not
gratitude
if
as
some
one
passed
a
snatch
of
song
got
tangled
among
your
texts
or
the
swing
of
a
robe
fluttered
your
studies
with
delight
remember
that
when
at
leisure
in
your
paradise
what
benefits
only
and
neither
beauty
nor
love
nor
kacha
some
things
are
beyond
the
power
of
words
devayani
yes
yes
i
know
my
love
has
sounded
your
heart
deepest
and
makes
me
bold
to
speak
in
defiance
of
your
reserve
never
leave
me
remain
here
fame
gives
no
happiness
friend
you
can
not
now
escape
for
your
secret
is
mine
kacha
no
no
devayani
devayani
how
no
do
not
lie
to
me
love
insight
is
divine
day
after
day
in
raising
your
head
in
a
glance
in
the
motion
of
your
hands
your
love
spoke
as
the
sea
speaks
through
its
waves
on
a
sudden
my
voice
would
send
your
heart
quivering
through
your
limbs
have
i
never
witnessed
it
i
know
you
and
therefore
you
are
my
captive
for
ever
the
very
king
of
your
gods
shall
not
sever
this
bond
kacha
was
it
for
this
devayani
that
i
toiled
away
from
home
and
kindred
all
these
years
devayani
why
not
is
only
knowledge
precious
is
love
cheap
lay
hold
on
this
moment
have
the
courage
to
own
that
a
woman
heart
is
worth
all
as
much
penance
as
men
undergo
for
the
sake
of
power
knowledge
or
reputation
kacha
i
gave
my
solemn
promise
to
the
gods
that
i
would
bring
them
this
lore
of
deathless
life
devayani
but
is
it
true
you
had
eyes
for
nothing
save
your
books
that
you
never
broke
off
your
studies
to
pay
me
homage
with
flowers
never
lay
in
wait
for
a
chance
of
an
evening
to
help
me
water
my
what
made
you
sit
by
me
on
the
grass
and
sing
songs
you
brought
hither
from
the
assembly
of
the
stars
while
darkness
stooped
over
the
river
bank
as
love
droops
over
its
own
sad
silence
were
these
parts
of
a
cruel
conspiracy
plotted
in
your
paradise
was
all
for
the
sake
of
access
to
my
father
heart
and
after
success
were
you
departing
to
throw
some
cheap
gratitude
like
small
coins
to
the
deluded
kacha
what
profit
were
there
proud
woman
in
knowing
the
truth
if
i
did
wrong
to
serve
you
with
a
passionate
devotion
cherished
in
secret
i
have
had
ample
punishment
this
is
no
time
to
question
whether
my
love
be
true
or
not
my
life
work
awaits
me
though
my
heart
must
henceforth
enclose
a
red
flame
vainly
striving
to
devour
emptiness
still
i
must
go
back
to
that
paradise
which
will
nevermore
be
paradise
to
me
i
owe
the
gods
a
new
divinity
hard
won
by
my
studies
before
i
may
think
of
happiness
forgive
me
devayani
and
know
that
my
suffering
is
doubled
by
the
pain
i
unwillingly
inflict
on
you
devayani
forgiveness
you
have
angered
my
heart
till
it
is
hard
and
burning
like
a
thunderbolt
you
can
go
back
to
your
work
and
your
glory
but
what
is
left
for
me
memory
is
a
bed
of
thorns
and
secret
shame
will
gnaw
at
the
roots
of
my
life
you
came
like
a
wayfarer
sat
through
the
sunny
hours
in
the
shade
of
my
garden
and
to
while
time
away
you
plucked
all
its
flowers
and
wove
them
into
a
chain
and
now
parting
you
snap
the
thread
and
let
the
flowers
drop
on
the
dust
accursed
be
that
great
knowledge
you
have
earned
a
burden
that
though
others
share
equally
with
you
will
never
be
lightened
for
lack
of
love
may
it
ever
remain
as
foreign
to
your
life
as
the
cold
stars
are
to
the
darkness
of
virgin
night
i
why
these
preparations
without
end
i
said
to
mind
is
some
one
to
come
mind
replied
i
am
enormously
busy
gathering
things
and
building
towers
i
have
no
time
to
answer
such
questions
meekly
i
went
back
to
my
work
when
things
were
grown
to
a
pile
when
seven
wings
of
his
palace
were
complete
i
said
to
mind
is
it
not
enough
mind
began
to
say
not
enough
to
contain
and
then
stopped
contain
what
i
asked
mind
affected
not
to
hear
i
suspected
that
mind
did
not
know
and
with
ceaseless
work
smothered
the
question
his
one
refrain
was
i
must
have
more
why
must
you
because
it
is
great
what
is
great
mind
remained
silent
i
pressed
for
an
answer
in
contempt
and
anger
mind
said
why
ask
about
things
that
are
not
take
notice
of
those
that
are
hugely
before
you
the
struggle
and
the
fight
the
army
and
armaments
the
bricks
and
mortar
and
labourers
without
number
i
thought
possibly
mind
is
wise
ii
days
passed
more
wings
were
added
to
his
palace
more
lands
to
his
domain
the
season
of
rains
came
to
an
end
the
dark
clouds
became
white
and
thin
and
in
the
sky
the
sunny
hours
hovered
like
butterflies
over
an
unseen
flower
i
was
bewildered
and
asked
everybody
i
met
what
is
that
music
in
the
breeze
a
tramp
walked
the
road
whose
dress
was
wild
as
his
manner
he
said
hark
to
the
music
of
the
coming
i
can
not
tell
why
i
was
convinced
but
the
words
broke
from
me
we
have
not
much
longer
to
wait
it
is
close
at
hand
said
the
mad
man
i
went
to
the
office
and
boldly
said
to
mind
stop
all
work
mind
asked
have
you
any
news
yes
i
answered
news
of
the
coming
but
i
could
not
explain
mind
shook
his
head
and
said
there
are
neither
banners
nor
pageantry
iii
the
night
waned
the
stars
paled
in
the
sky
suddenly
the
touchstone
of
the
morning
light
tinged
everything
with
gold
a
cry
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
here
is
the
herald
i
bowed
my
head
and
asked
is
he
coming
the
answer
seemed
to
burst
from
all
sides
yes
mind
grew
troubled
and
said
the
dome
of
my
building
is
not
yet
finished
nothing
is
in
order
a
voice
came
from
the
sky
pull
down
your
building
but
why
asked
mind
because
is
the
day
of
the
coming
and
your
building
is
in
the
way
iv
the
lofty
building
lies
in
the
dust
and
all
is
scattered
and
broken
mind
looked
about
but
what
was
there
to
see
only
the
morning
star
and
the
lily
washed
in
dew
and
what
else
a
child
running
laughing
from
its
mother
arms
into
the
open
light
was
it
only
for
this
that
they
said
it
was
the
day
of
the
coming
yes
this
was
why
they
said
there
was
music
in
the
air
and
light
in
the
sky
and
did
they
claim
all
the
earth
only
for
this
yes
came
the
answer
mind
you
build
walls
to
imprison
yourself
your
servants
toil
to
enslave
themselves
but
the
whole
earth
and
infinite
space
are
for
the
child
for
the
new
life
what
does
that
child
bring
you
hope
for
all
the
world
and
its
joy
mind
asked
me

you
understand
i
lay
my
work

thy
touch
thrills
into
flowers
that
trailing
skirt
of
thine
sweeps
the
whirl
of
a
dance
among
the
stars
and
thy
music
is
echoed
from
innumerable
worlds
through
signs
and
colours
single
and
alone
in
the
unfathomed
stillness
of
the
soul
art
thou
lady
of
silence
and
solitude
a
vision
thrilled
with
light
a
lonely
lotus
blossoming
on
the
stem
of
love
behind
the
rusty
iron
gratings
of
the
opposite
window
sits
a
girl
dark
and
plain
of
face
like
a
boat
stranded
on
a
when
the
river
is
shallow
in
the
summer
i
come
back
to
my
room
after
my
day
work
and
my
tired
eyes
are
lured
to
her
she
seems
to
me
like
a
lake
with
its
dark
lonely
waters
edged
by
moonlight
she
has
only
her
window
for
freedom
there
the
morning
light
meets
her
musings
and
through
it
her
dark
eyes
like
lost
stars
travel
back
to
their
sky
i
remember
the
day
the
heavy
shower
of
rain
is
slackening
into
fitful
pauses
renewed
gusts
of
wind
startle
it
from
a
first
lull
i
take
up
my
instrument
idly
i
touch
the
strings
till
without
my
knowing
the
music
borrows
the
mad
cadence
of
that
storm
i
see
her
figure
as
she
steals
from
her
work
stops
at
my
door
and
retreats
with
hesitating
steps
she
comes
again
stands
outside
leaning
against
the
wall
then
slowly
enters
the
room
and
sits
down
with
head
bent
she
plies
her
needle
in
silence
but
soon
stops
her
work
and
looks
out
of
the
window
through
the
rain
at
the
blurred
line
of
trees
only
this
one
hour
of
a
rainy
noon
filled
with
shadows
and
song
and
silence
while
stepping
into
the
carriage
she
turned
her
head
and
threw
me
a
swift
glance
of
farewell
this
was
her
last
gift
to
me
but
where
can
i
keep
it
safe
from
the
trampling
hours
must
evening
sweep
this
gleam
of
anguish
away
as
it
will
the
last
flicker
of
fire
from
the
sunset
ought
it
to
be
washed
off
by
the
rain
as
treasured
pollens
are
from
flowers
leave
kingly
glory
and
the
wealth
of
the
rich
to
death
but
may
not
tears
keep
ever
fresh
the
memory
of
a
glance
flung
through
a
passionate
moment
give
it
to
me
to
keep
said
my
song
i
never
touch
kings
glory
or
the
wealth
of
the
rich
but
these
small
things
are
mine
for
ever
you
give
yourself
to
me
like
a
flower
that
blossoms
at
night
whose
presence
is
known
by
the
dew
that
drips
from
it
by
the
odour
shed
through
the
darkness
as
the
first
steps
of
spring
are
by
the
buds
that
thicken
the
twigs
you
break
upon
my
thought
like
waves
at
the
high
tide
and
my
heart
is
drowned
under
surging
songs
my
heart
knew
of
your
coming
as
the
night
feels
the
approach
of
dawn
the
clouds
are
aflame
and
my
sky
fills
with
a
great
revealing
flood
i
was
to
go
away
still
she
did
not
speak
but
i
felt
from
a
slight
quiver
her
yearning
arms
would
say
ah
no
not
yet
i
have
often
heard
her
pleading
hands
vocal
in
a
touch
though
they
knew
not
what
they
said
i
have
known
those
arms
to
stammer
when
had
they
not
they
would
have
become
youth
garland
round
my
neck
their
little
gestures
return
to
remembrance
in
the
covert
of
still
hours
like
truants
they
playfully
reveal
things
she
had
kept
secret
from
me
my
songs
are
like
bees
they
follow
through
the
air
some
fragrant
trace
some
memory
of
you
to
hum
around
your
shyness
eager
for
its
hidden
store
when
the
freshness
of
dawn
droops
in
the
sun
when
in
the
noon
the
air
hangs
low
with
heaviness
and
the
forest
is
silent
my
songs
return
home
their
languid
wings
dusted
with
gold
i
believe
you
had
visited
me
in
a
vision
before
we
ever
met
like
some
foretaste
of
april
before
the
spring
broke
into
flower
that
vision
must
have
come
when
all
was
bathed
in
the
odour
of
blossom
when
the
twilight
twinkle
of
the
river
fringed
its
yellow
sands
and
the
vague
sounds
of
a
summer
afternoon
were
blended
yes
and
had
it
not
laughed
and
evaded
me
in
many
a
nameless
gleam
at
other
moments
i
think
i
shall
stop
startled
if
ever
we
meet
after
our
next
birth
walking
in
the
light
of
a
world
i
shall
know
those
dark
eyes
then
as
morning
stars
and
yet
feel
that
they
have
belonged
to
some
unremembered
evening
sky
of
a
former
life
i
shall
know
that
the
magic
of
your
face
is
not
all
its
own
but
has
stolen
the
passionate
light
that
was
in
my
eyes
at
some
immemorial
meeting
and
then
gathered
from
my
love
a
mystery
that
has
now
forgotten
its
origin
lay
down
your
lute
my
love
leave
your
arms
free
to
embrace
me
let
your
touch
bring
my
overflowing
heart
to
my
body
utmost
brink
do
not
bend
your
neck
and
turn
away
your
face
but
offer
up
a
kiss
to
me
which
has
been
like
some
perfume
long
closed
in
a
bud
do
not
smother
this
moment
under
vain
words
but
let
our
hearts
quake
in
a
rush
of
silence
sweeping
all
thoughts
to
the
shoreless
delight
you
have
made
me
great
with
your
love
though
i
am
but
one
among
the
many
drifting
in
the
common
tide
rocking
in
the
fluctuant
favour
of
the
world
you
have
given
me
a
seat
where
poets
of
all
time
bring
their
tribute
and
lovers
with
deathless
names
greet
one
another
across
the
ages
men
hastily
pass
me
in
the
market
never
noting
how
my
body
has
grown
precious
with
your
caress
how
i
carry
your
kiss
within
as
the
sun
carries
in
its
orb
the
fire
of
the
divine
touch
and
shines
for
ever
like
a
child
that
frets
and
pushes
away
its
toys
my
heart
shakes
its
head
at
every
phrase
i
suggest
and
says
no
not
this
yet
words
in
the
agony
of
their
vagueness
haunt
my
mind
like
vagrant
clouds
hovering
over
hills
waiting
for
some
chance
wind
to
relieve
them
of
their
rain
but
leave
these
vain
efforts
my
soul
for
the
stillness
will
ripen
its
own
music
in
the
dark
my
life
is
like
a
cloister
during
some
penance
where
the
spring
is
afraid
to
stir
or
to
whisper
this
is
not
the
time
my
love
for
you
to
pass
the
gate
at
the
mere
thought
of
your
anklet
bells
tinkling
down
the
path
the
garden
echoes
are
ashamed
know
that
songs
are
in
bud
and
should
they
see
you
walk
by
they
would
strain
to
breaking
their
immature
hearts
whence
do
you
bring
this
disquiet
my
love
let
my
heart
touch
yours
and
kiss
the
pain
out
of
your
silence
the
night
has
thrown
up
from
its
depth
this
little
hour
that
love
may
build
a
new
world
within
these
shut
doors
to
be
lighted
by
this
solitary
lamp
we
have
for
music
but
a
single
reed
which
our
two
pairs
of
lips
must
play
on
by
turns
for
crown
only
one
garland
to
bind
my
hair
after
i
have
put
it
on
your
forehead
tearing
the
veil
from
my
breast
i
shall
make
our
bed
on
the
floor
and
one
kiss
and
one
sleep
of
delight
shall
fill
our
small
boundless
world
all
that
i
had
i
gave
to
you
keeping
but
the
barest
veil
of
reserve
it
is
so
thin
that
you
secretly
smile
at
it
and
i
feel
ashamed
the
gust
of
the
spring
breeze
sweeps
it
away
unawares
and
the
flutter
of
my
own
heart
moves
it
as
the
waves
move
their
foam
my
love
do
not
grieve
if
i
keep
this
flimsy
mist
of
distance
round
me
this
frail
reserve
of
mine
is
no
mere
woman
coyness
but
a
slender
stem
on
which
the
flower
of
my
bends
towards
you
with
reticent
grace
i
have
donned
this
new
robe
because
my
body
feels
like
singing
it
is
not
enough
that
i
am
given
to
my
love
once
and
for
ever
but
out
of
that
i
must
fashion
new
gifts
every
day
and
shall
i
not
seem
a
fresh
offering
dressed
in
a
new
robe
my
heart
like
the
evening
sky
has
its
endless
passion
for
colour
and
therefore
i
change
my
veils
which
have
now
the
green
of
the
cool
young
grass
and
now
that
of
the
winter
rice
my
robe
is
tinted
with
the
blue
of
the
sky
it
brings
to
my
limbs
the
colour
of
the
boundless
the
colour
of
the
oversea
hills
and
it
carries
in
its
folds
the
delight
of
summer
clouds
flying
in
the
wind
i
thought
i
would
write
love
words
in
their
own
colour
but
that
lies
deep
in
the
heart
and
tears
are
pale
would
you
know
them
friend
if
the
words
were
colourless
i
thought
i
would
sing
love
words
to
their
own
tune
but
that
sounds
only
in
my
heart
and
my
eyes
are
silent
would
you
know
them
friend
if
there
were
no
tune
in
the
night
the
song
came
to
me
but
you
were
not
there
it
found
the
words
for
which
i
had
been
seeking
all
day
yes
in
the
stillness
a
moment
after
dark
they
throbbed
into
music
even
as
the
stars
then
began
to
pulse
with
light
but
you
were
not
there
my
hope
was
to
sing
it
to
you
in
the
morning
but
try
as
i
might
though
the
music
came
the
words
hung
back
when
you
were
beside
me
the
night
deepens
and
the
dying
flame
flickers
in
the
lamp
i
forgot
to
notice
when
the
evening
like
a
village
girl
who
has
filled
her
pitcher
at
the
river
a
last
time
for
that
day
closed
the
door
on
her
cabin
i
was
speaking
to
you
my
love
with
mind
barely
conscious
of
my
voice
tell
me
had
it
any
meaning
did
it
bring
you
any
message
from
beyond
life
borders
for
now
since
my
voice
has
ceased
i
feel
the
night
throbbing
with
thoughts
that
gaze
in
awe
at
the
abyss
of
their
dumbness
when
we
two
first
met
my
heart
rang
out
in
music
she
who
is
eternally
afar
is
beside
you
for
ever
that
music
is
silent
because
i
have
grown
to
believe
that
my
love
is
only
near
and
have
forgotten
that
she
is
also
far
far
away
music
fills
the
infinite
between
two
souls
this
has
been
muffled
by
the
mist
of
our
daily
habits
on
shy
summer
nights
when
the
breeze
brings
a
vast
murmur
out
of
the
silence
i
sit
up
in
my
bed
and
mourn
the
great
loss
of
her
who
is
beside
me
i
ask
myself
when
shall
i
have
another
chance
to
whisper
to
her
words
with
the
rhythm
of
eternity
in
them
wake
up
my
song
from
thy
languor
rend
this
screen
of
the
familiar
and
fly
to
my
beloved
there
in
the
endless
surprise
of
our
first
meeting
lovers
come
to
you
my
queen
and
proudly
lay
their
riches
at
your
feet
but
my
tribute
is
made
up
of
unfulfilled
hopes
shadows
have
stolen
across
the
heart
of
my
world
and
the
best
in
me
has
lost
light
while
the
fortunate
laugh
at
my
penury
i
ask
you
to
lend
my
failings
your
tears
and
so
make
them
precious
i
bring
you
a
voiceless
instrument
i
strained
to
reach
a
note
which
was
too
high
in
my
heart
and
the
string
broke
while
masters
laugh
at
the
snapped
cord
i
ask
you
to
take
my
lute
in
your
hands
and
fill
its
hollowness
with
your
songs
the
father
came
back
from
the
funeral
rites
his
boy
of
seven
stood
at
the
window
with
eyes
wide
open
and
a
golden
amulet
hanging
from
his
neck
full
of
thoughts
too
difficult
for
his
age
his
father
took
him
in
his
arms
and
the
boy
asked
him
where
is
mother
in
heaven
answered
his
father
pointing
to
the
sky
at
night
the
father
groaned
in
slumber
weary
with
grief
a
lamp
dimly
burned
near
the
bedroom
door
and
a
lizard
chased
moths
on
the
wall
the
boy
woke
up
from
sleep
felt
with
his
hands
the
emptiness
in
the
bed
and
stole
out
to
the
open
terrace
the
boy
raised
his
eyes
to
the
sky
and
long
gazed
in
silence
his
bewildered
mind
sent
abroad
into
the
night
the
question
where
is
heaven
no
answer
came
and
the
stars
seemed
like
the
burning
tears
of
that
ignorant
darkness
she
went
away
when
the
night
was
about
to
wane
my
mind
tried
to
console
me
by
saying
all
is
vanity
i
felt
angry
and
said
that
unopened
letter
with
her
name
on
it
and
this
fan
bordered
with
red
silk
by
her
own
hands
are
they
not
real
the
day
passed
and
my
friend
came
and
said
to
me
whatever
is
good
is
true
and
can
never
perish
how
do
you
know
i
asked
impatiently
was
not
this
body
good
which
is
now
lost
to
the
world
as
a
fretful
child
hurting
its
own
mother
i
tried
to
wreck
all
the
shelters
that
ever
i
had
in
and
about
me
and
cried
this
world
is
treacherous
suddenly
i
felt
a
voice
saying
ungrateful
i
looked
out
of
the
window
and
a
reproach
seemed
to
come
from
the
night
you
pour
out
into
the
void
of
my
absence
your
faith
in
the
truth
that
i
came
the
river
is
grey
and
the
air
dazed
with
blown
sand
on
a
morning
of
dark
disquiet
when
the
birds
are
mute
and
their
nests
shake
in
the
gust
i
sit
alone
and
ask
myself
where
is
she
the
days
have
flown
wherein
we
sat
too
near
each
other
we
laughed
and
jested
and
the
awe
of
love
majesty
found
no
words
at
our
meetings
i
made
myself
small
and
she
trifled
away
every
moment
with
pelting
talk
i
wish
in
vain
that
she
were
by
me
in
the
gloom
of
the
coming
storm
to
sit
in
the
soul
solitude
the
name
she
called
me
by
like
a
flourishing
jasmine
covered
the
whole
seventeen
years
of
our
love
with
its
sound
mingled
the
quiver
of
the
light
through
the
leaves
the
scent
of
the
grass
in
the
rainy
night
and
the
sad
silence
of
the
last
hour
of
many
an
idle
day
not
the
work
of
god
alone
was
he
who
answered
to
that
name
she
created
him
again
for
herself
during
those
seventeen
swift
years
other
years
were
to
follow
but
their
vagrant
days
no
longer
gathered
within
the
fold
of
that
name
uttered
in
her
voice
stray
and
are
scattered
they
ask
me
who
should
fold
us
i
find
no
answer
and
sit
silent
and
they
cry
to
me
while
dispersing
we
seek
a
shepherdess
whom
should
they
seek
that
they
do
not
know
and
like
derelict
evening
clouds
they
drift
in
the
trackless
dark
and
are
lost
and
forgotten
i
feel
that
your
brief
days
of
love
have
not
been
left
behind
in
those
scanty
years
of
your
life
i
seek
to
know
in
what
place
away
from
the
dust
you
keep
them
now
i
find
in
my
solitude
some
song
of
your
evening
that
died
yet
left
a
deathless
echo
and
the
sighs
of
your
unsatisfied
hours
i
find
nestled
in
the
warm
quiet
of
the
autumn
noon
your
desires
come
from
the
hive
of
the
past
to
haunt
my
heart
and
i
sit
still
to
listen
to
their
wings
you
have
taken
a
bath
in
the
dark
sea
you
are
once
again
veiled
in
a
bride
robe
and
through
death
arch
you
come
back
to
repeat
our
wedding
in
the
soul
neither
lute
nor
drum
is
struck
no
crowd
has
gathered
not
a
wreath
is
hung
on
the
gate
your
unuttered
words
meet
mine
in
a
ritual
unillumined
by
lamps
i
was
walking
along
a
path
overgrown
with
grass
when
suddenly
i
heard
from
some
one
behind
see
if
you
know
me
i
turned
round
and
looked
at
her
and
said
i
can
not
remember
your
name
she
said
i
am
that
first
great
sorrow
whom
you
met
when
you
were
young
her
eyes
looked
like
a
morning
whose
dew
is
still
in
the
air
i
stood
silent
for
some
time
till
i
said
have
you
lost
all
the
great
burden
of
your
tears
she
smiled
and
said
nothing
i
felt
that
her
tears
had
had
time
to
learn
the
language
of
smiles
once
you
said
she
whispered
that
you
would
cherish
your
grief
for
ever
i
blushed
and
said
yes
but
years
have
passed
and
i
forget
then
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
and
said
but
you
have
changed
what
was
sorrow
once
has
now
become
peace
she
said
our
life
sails
on
the
uncrossed
sea
whose
waves
chase
each
other
in
an
eternal
it
is
the
restless
sea
of
change
feeding
its
foaming
flocks
to
lose
them
over
and
over
again
beating
its
hands
against
the
calm
of
the
sky
love
in
the
centre
of
this
circling
of
light
and
dark
yours
is
that
green
island
where
the
sun
kisses
the
shy
forest
shade
and
silence
is
wooed
by
birds
singing
ama
and
vinayaka
ama
and
vinayaka
on
the
battlefield
ama
her
vinayaka
ama
father
vinayaka
shameless
wanton
you
call
me
father
you
who
did
not
shrink
from
a
mussulman
husband
ama
though
you
have
treacherously
killed
my
husband
yet
you
are
my
father
and
i
hold
back
a
widow
tears
lest
they
bring
god
curse
on
you
since
we
have
met
on
this
battlefield
after
years
of
separation
let
me
bow
to
your
feet
and
take
my
last
leave
vinayaka
where
will
you
go
ama
the
tree
on
which
you
built
your
impious
nest
is
hewn
down
where
will
take
shelter
ama
i
have
my
son
vinayaka
leave
him
cast
never
a
fond
look
back
on
the
result
of
a
sin
expiated
with
blood
think
where
to
go
ama
death
open
gates
are
wider
than
a
father
love
vinayaka
death
indeed
swallows
sins
as
the
sea
swallows
the
mud
of
rivers
but
you
are
to
die
neither
nor
here
seek
some
solitary
shrine
of
holy
shiva
far
from
shamed
kindred
and
all
neighbours
bathe
three
times
a
day
in
sacred
ganges
and
while
reciting
god
name
listen
to
the
last
bell
of
evening
worship
that
death
may
look
tenderly
upon
you
as
a
father
on
his
sleeping
child
whose
eyes
are
still
wet
with
tears
let
him
gently
carry
you
into
his
own
great
silence
as
the
ganges
carries
a
fallen
flower
on
its
stream
washing
every
stain
away
to
render
it
a
fit
offering
to
the
sea
ama
but
my
son
vinayaka
again
i
bid
you
not
to
speak
of
him
lay
yourself
once
more
in
a
arms
my
child
like
a
babe
fresh
from
the
womb
of
oblivion
your
second
mother
ama
to
me
the
world
has
become
a
shadow
your
words
i
hear
but
can
not
take
to
heart
leave
me
father
leave
me
alone

not
try
to
bind
me
with
your
love

its
bands

my
husband

vinayaka
alas
no
flower
ever
returns
to
the
parent
branch
it
dropped
from
how
can
you
call
him
who
forcibly
snatched
you
from
jivaji
to
whom
you
had
been
sacredly
affianced
i
shall
never
forget
that
night
in
the
wedding
hall
we
sat
anxiously
expecting
the
bridegroom
for
the
auspicious
hour
was
dwindling
away
then
in
the
distance
appeared
the
glare
of
torches
and
bridal
strains
came
floating
up
the
air
we
shouted
for
joy
women
blew
their
a
procession
of
palanquins
entered
the
courtyard
but
while
we
were
asking
where
is
jivaji
armed
men
burst
out
of
the
litters
like
a
storm
and
bore
you
off
before
we
knew
what
had
happened
shortly
after
jivaji
came
to
tell
us
he
had
been
waylaid
and
captured
by
a
mussulman
noble
of
the
vijapur
court
that
night
jivaji
and
i
touched
the
nuptial
fire
and
swore
bloody
death
to
this
villain
after
waiting
long
we
have
been
freed
from
our
solemn
pledge
and
the
spirit
of
jivaji
who
lost
his
life
in
this
battle
lawfully
claims
you
for
wife
ama
father
it
may
be
that
i
have
disgraced
the
rites
of
your
house
but
my
honour
is
unsullied

loved
him
to
whom
i
bore
a
son

remember
the
night
when
i
received
two
secret
messages

from

double
bidding

been
obeyed
but
my
body
was
yielded
only
after
love
had
given
love
all
the
greater
all
the
purer
in
that
it
overcame
the
hereditary
recoil
of
our
blood
from
the
mussulman

had
not
hoped
to
see
you

violently
snapped

sprung

our
life
a

feed
glowing

ashes
of
my

by
force
you
unite
me

a
painter
was
selling
pictures
at
the
fair
followed
by
servants
there
passed
the
son
of
a
minister
who
in
youth
had
cheated
this
painter
father
so
that
he
had
died
of
a
broken
heart
the
boy
lingered
before
the
pictures
and
chose
one
for
himself
the
painter
flung
a
cloth
over
it
and
said
he
would
not
sell
it
after
this
the
boy
pined
till
his
father
came
and
offered
a
large
price
but
the
painter
kept
the
picture
unsold
on
his
and
grimly
sat
before
it
saying
to
himself
this
is
my
revenge
the
sole
form
this
painter
worship
took
was
to
trace
an
image
of
his
god
every
morning
and
now
he
felt
these
pictures
grow
daily
more
different
from
those
he
used
to
paint
this
troubled
him
and
he
sought
in
vain
for
an
explanation
till
one
day
he
started
up
from
work
in
horror
the
eyes
of
the
god
he
had
just
drawn
were
those
of
the
minister
and
so
were
the
lips
he
tore
up
the
picture
crying
my
revenge
has
returned
on
my
head
the
general
came
before
the
silent
and
angry
king
and
saluting
him
said
the
village
is
punished
the
men
are
stricken
to
dust
and
the
women
cower
in
their
unlit
homes
afraid
to
weep
aloud
the
high
priest
stood
up
and
blessed
the
king
and
cried
god
mercy
is
ever
upon
you
the
clown
when
he
heard
this
burst
out
laughing
and
startled
the
court
the
king
frown
darkened
the
honour
of
the
throne
said
the
minister
is
upheld
by
the
prowess
and
the
blessing
of
almighty
god
louder
laughed
the
clown
and
the
king
growled
unseemly
mirth
god
has
showered
many
blessings
upon
your
head
said
the
clown
the
one
he
bestowed
on
me
was
the
gift
of
laughter
this
gift
will
cost
you
your
life
said
the
king
gripping
his
sword
with
his
right
hand
yet
the
clown
stood
up
and
laughed
till
he
laughed
no
more
a
shadow
of
dread
fell
upon
the
court
for
they
heard
that
laughter
echoing
in
the
depth
of
god
silence
the
mother
prayer
the
mother
prayer
duryodhana
the
son
of
the
blind
kaurava
king
dhritarashtra
and
of
queen
gandhari
has
played
with
his
cousins
the
pandava
kings
for
their
kingdom
and
won
it
by
dhritarashtra
you
have
compassed
your
end
duryodhana
success
is
mine
dhritarashtra
are
you
happy
duryodhana
i
am
victorious
dhritarashtra
i
ask
you
again
what
happiness
have
you
in
winning
the
undivided
kingdom
duryodhana
sire
a
kshatriya
thirsts
not
after
happiness
but
victory
that
fiery
wine
pressed
from
seething
jealousy
wretchedly
happy
we
were
like
those
inglorious
stains
that
lie
idly
on
the
breast
of
the
moon
when
we
lived
in
peace
under
the
friendly
dominance
of
our
cousins
then
these
pandavas
milked
the
world
of
its
wealth
and
allowed
us
a
share
in
brotherly
tolerance
now
that
they
own
defeat
and
expect
banishment
i
am
no
longer
happy
but
exultant
dhritarashtra
wretch
you
forget
that
both
pandavas
and
kauravas
have
the
same
forefathers
duryodhana
it
was
difficult
to
forget
that
and
therefore
our
inequalities
rankled
in
my
heart
at
midnight
the
moon
is
never
jealous
of
the
noonday
sun
but
the
struggle
to
share
one
horizon
between
both
orbs
can
not
last
forever
thank
heaven
that
struggle
is
over
and
we
have
at
last
won
solitude
in
glory
dhritarashtra
the
mean
jealousy
duryodhana
jealousy
is
never
mean
it
is
in
the
essence
of
greatness
grass
can
grow
in
crowded
amity
not
giant
trees
stars
live
in
clusters
but
the
sun
and
moon
are
lonely
in
their
splendour
the
pale
moon
of
the
pandavas
sets
behind
the
forest
shadows
leaving
the
sun
of
the
kauravas
to
rejoice
dhritarashtra
but
right
has
been
defeated
duryodhana
right
for
rulers
is
not
what
is
right
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
the
people
thrive
by
comradeship
but
for
a
king
equals
are
enemies
they
are
obstacles
ahead
they
are
terrors
from
behind
there
is
no
place
for
brothers
or
friends
in
a
king
polity
its
one
solid
foundation
is
conquest
dhritarashtra
i
refuse
to
call
a
conquest
what
was
won
by
fraud
in
gambling
duryodhana
a
man
is
not
shamed
by
refusing
to
challenge
a
tiger
on
equal
terms
with
teeth
and
nails
our
weapons
are
those
proper
for
success
not
for
suicide
father
i
am
proud
of
the
result
and
disdain
regret
for
the
means
dhritarashtra
but
justice
duryodhana
fools
alone
dream
of
justice
success
is
not
yet
theirs
but
those
born
to
rule
rely
on
power
merciless
and
unhampered
with
scruples
dhritarashtra
your
success
will
bring
down
on
you
a
loud
and
angry
flood
of
detraction
duryodhana
the
people
will
take
amazingly
little
time
to
learn
that
duryodhana
is
king
and
has
power
to
crush
calumny
under
foot
dhritarashtra
calumny
dies
of
weariness
dancing
on
do
not
drive
it
into
the
heart
to
gather
strength
duryodhana
unuttered
defamation
does
not
touch
a
king
dignity
i
care
not
if
love
is
refused
us
but
insolence
shall
not
be
borne
love
depends
upon
the
will
of
the
giver
and
the
poorest
of
the
poor
can
indulge
in
such
generosity
let
them
squander
it
on
their
pet
cats
tame
dogs
and
our
good
cousins
the
pandavas
i
shall
never
envy
them
fear
is
the
tribute
i
claim
for
my
royal
throne
father
only
too
leniently
you
lent
your
ear
to
those
who
slandered
your
sons
but
if
you
intend
still
to
allow
those
pious
friends
of
yours
to
revel
in
shrill
denunciation
at
the
expense
of
your
children
let
us
exchange
our
kingdom
for
the
exile
of
our
cousins
and
go
to
the
wilderness
where
happily
friends
are
never
cheap
dhritarashtra
could
the
pious
warnings
of
my
friends
lessen
my
love
for
my
sons
then
we
might
be
saved
but
i
have
dipped
my
hands
in
the
mire
of
your
infamy
and
lost
my
sense
of
goodness
for
your
sakes
i
have
heedlessly
set
fire
to
the
ancient
forest
of
our
royal
lineage
so
dire
is
my
love
clasped
breast
to
breast
we
like
a
double
meteor
are
blindly
plunging
into
ruin
therefore
doubt
not
my
love
relax
not
your
embrace
till
the
brink
of
annihilation
be
reached
beat
your
drums
of
victory
lift
your
banner
of
triumph
in
this
mad
riot
of
exultant
evil
brothers
and
friends
will
disperse
till
nothing
remain
save
the
doomed
father
the
doomed
son
and
god
curse
an
sire
queen
gandhari
asks
for
audience
dhritarashtra
i
await
her
duryodhana
let
me
take
my
leave
dhritarashtra
fly
for
you
can
not
bear
the
fire
of
your
mother
presence
queen
gandhari
mother
duryodhana
gandhari
at
your
feet
i
crave
a
boon
dhritarashtra
speak
your
wish
is
fulfilled
gandhari
the
time
has
come
to
renounce
him
dhritarashtra
whom
my
queen
gandhari
duryodhana
dhritarashtra
our
own
son
duryodhana
gandhari
yes
dhritarashtra
this
is
a
terrible
boon
for
you
his
mother
to
crave
gandhari
the
fathers
of
the
kauravas
who
are
in
paradise
join
me
in
beseeching
you
dhritarashtra
the
divine
judge
will
punish
him
who
has
broken
his
laws
but
i
am
his
father
gandhari
am
i
not
his
mother
have
i
not
carried
him
under
my
throbbing
heart
yes
i
ask
you
to
renounce
duryodhana
the
unrighteous
dhritarashtra
what
will
remain
to
us
after
that
gandhari
god
blessing
dhritarashtra
and
what
will
that
bring
us
gandhari
new
afflictions
pleasure
in
our
son
presence
pride
in
a
new
kingdom
and
shame
at
knowing
both
purchased
by
wrong
done
or
connived
at
like
thorns
dragged
two
ways
would
lacerate
our
bosoms
the
pandavas
are
too
proud
ever
to
accept
back
from
us
the
lands
which
they
have
relinquished
therefore
it
is
only
meet
that
we
draw
some
great
sorrow
down
on
our
heads
so
as
to
deprive
that
unmerited
reward
of
its
sting
dhritarashtra
queen
you
inflict
fresh
pain
on
a
heart
already
rent
gandhari
sire
the
punishment
imposed
on
our
son
will
be
more
ours
than
his
a
judge
callous
to
the
pain
that
he
inflicts
loses
the
right
to
judge
and
if
you
spare
your
son
to
save
yourself
pain
then
all
the
culprits
ever
punished
by
your
hands
will
cry
before
god
throne
for
vengeance
had
they
not
also
their
fathers
dhritarashtra
no
more
of
this
queen
i
pray
you
our
son
is
abandoned
of
god
that
is
why
i
can
not
give
him
up
to
save
him
is
no
longer
in
my
power
and
therefore
my
consolation
is
to
share
his
guilt
and
tread
the
path
of
destruction
his
solitary
companion
what
is
done
is
done
let
follow
what
must
follow
gandhari
be
calm
my
heart
and
patiently
await
god
judgment
oblivious
night
wears
on
the
morning
of
reckoning
nears
i
hear
the
thundering
roar
of
its
chariot
woman
bow
your
head
down
to
the
dust
and
as
a
sacrifice
fling
your
heart
under
those
wheels
darkness
will
shroud
the
sky
earth
will
tremble
wailing
will
rend
the
air
and
then
comes
the
silent
and
cruel
end
that
terrible
peace
that
great
forgetting
and
awful
extinction
of
hatred
the
supreme
deliverance
rising
from
the
fire
of
death
fiercely
they
rend
in
pieces
the
carpet
woven
during
ages
of
prayer
for
the
welcome
of
the
world
best
hope
the
great
preparations
of
love
lie
a
heap
of
shreds
and
there
is
nothing
on
the
ruined
altar
to
remind
the
mad
crowd
that
their
god
was
to
have
come
in
a
fury
of
passion
they
seem
to
have
burnt
their
future
to
cinders
and
with
it
the
season
of
their
bloom
the
air
is
harsh
with
the
cry
victory
to
the
brute
the
children
look
haggard
and
aged
they
whisper
to
one
another
that
time
revolves
but
never
advances
that
we
are
goaded
to
run
but
have
nothing
to
reach
that
creation
is
like
a
blind
man
groping
i
said
to
myself
cease
thy
singing
song
is
for
one
who
is
to
come
the
struggle
without
an
end
is
for
things
that
are
the
road
that
ever
lies
along
like
some
one
with
ear
to
the
ground
listening
for
footsteps
gleans
no
hint
of
coming
guest
nothing
of
the
house
at
its
far
end
my
lute
said
trample
me
in
the
dust
i
looked
at
the
dust
by
the
roadside
there
was
a
tiny
flower
among
thorns
and
i
cried
the
world
hope
is
not
dead
the
sky
stooped
over
the
horizon
to
whisper
to
the
earth
and
a
hush
of
expectation
filled
the
air
i
saw
the
palm
leaves
clapping
their
hands
to
the
beat
of
inaudible
music
and
the
moon
exchanged
glances
with
the
glistening
silence
of
the
lake
the
road
said
to
me
fear
nothing
and
my
lute
said
lend
me
thy
songs

unlettered
and
unconventional
whose
songs
are
loved
and
sung
by
the
people
the
literal
meaning
of
the
word
baul
is
the
mad
this
longing
to
meet
in
the
play
of
love
my
lover
is
not
only
mine
but
yours
your
lips
can
smile
your
flute
make
music
only
through
delight
in
my
love
therefore
you
are
importunate
even
as
i
i
sit
here
on
the
road
do
not
ask
me
to
walk
further
if
your
love
can
be
complete
without
mine
let
me
turn
back
from
seeking
you
i
refuse
to
beg
a
sight
of
you
if
you
do
not
feel
my
need
i
am
blind
with
market
dust
and
glare
and
so
wait
in
hopes
that
your
heart
my
heart
lover
will
send
you
to
find
me
i
am
poured
forth
in
living
notes
of
joy
and
sorrow
by
your
breath
mornings
and
evenings
in
summer
and
in
rains
i
am
fashioned
to
music
should
i
be
wholly
spent
in
some
flight
of
song
i
shall
not
grieve
the
tune
is
so
dear
to
me
my
heart
is
a
flute
he
has
played
on
if
ever
it
fall
into
other
hands
let
him
fling
it
away
my
lover
flute
is
dear
to
him
therefore
if
alien
breath
have
entered
it
and
sounded
strange
notes
let
him
break
it
to
pieces
and
strew
the
dust
with
them
in
love
the
aim
is
neither
pain
nor
pleasure
but
love
only
while
free
love
binds
division
destroys
it
for
love
is
what
unites
love
is
lit
from
love
as
fire
from
fire
but
whence
came
the
first
flame
in
your
being
it
leaps
under
the
rod
of
pain
then
when
the
hidden
fire
flames
forth
the
in
and
the
out
are
one
and
all
barriers
fall
in
ashes
let
the
pain
glow
fiercely
burst
from
the
heart
and
beat
back
darkness
need
you
be
afraid
the
poet
says
who
can
buy
love
without
paying
its
price
when
you
fail
to
give
yourself
you
make
the
whole
world
miserly
eyes
see
only
dust
and
earth
but
feel
with
the
heart
and
know
pure
joy
the
delights
blossom
on
all
sides
in
every
form
but
where
is
your
thread
to
make
a
wreath
of
them
my
master
flute
sounds
through
all
things
drawing
me
out
of
my
lodgings
wherever
they
may
be
and
while
i
listen
i
know
that
every
step
i
take
is
in
my
master
house
for
he
is
the
sea
he
is
the
river
that
leads
to
the
sea
and
he
is
the
strange
ways
has
my
guest
he
comes
at
times
when
i
am
unprepared
yet
how
can
i
refuse
him
i
watch
all
night
with
lighted
lamp
he
stays
away
when
the
light
goes
out
and
the
room
is
bare
he
comes
claiming
his
seat
and
can
i
keep
him
waiting
i
laugh
and
make
merry
with
friends
then
suddenly
i
start
up
for
lo
he
passes
me
by
in
sorrow
and
i
know
my
mirth
was
vain
i
have
often
seen
a
smile
in
his
eyes
when
my
heart
ached
then
i
knew
my
sorrow
was
not
real
yet
i
never
complain
when
i
do
not
understand
him
i
am
the
boat
you
are
the
sea
and
also
the
boatman
though
you
never
make
the
shore
though
you
let
me
sink
why
should
i
be
foolish
and
afraid
is
reaching
the
shore
a
greater
prize
than
losing
myself
with
you
if
you
are
only
the
haven
as
they
say
then
what
is
the
sea
let
it
surge
and
toss
me
on
its
waves
i
shall
be
content
i
live
in
you
whatever
and
however
you
appear
save
me
or
kill
me
as
you
wish
only
never
leave
me
in
other
hands
make
way
o
bud
make
way
burst
open
thy
heart
and
make
way
the
opening
spirit
has
overtaken
thee
canst
thou
remain
a
bud
any
longer
iii
come
spring
reckless
lover
of
the
earth
make
the
forest
heart
pant
for
utterance
come
in
gusts
of
disquiet
where
flowers
break
open
and
jostle
the
new
leaves
burst
like
a
rebellion
of
light
through
the
night
vigil
through
the
lake
dark
dumbness
through
the
dungeon
under
the
dust
proclaiming
freedom
to
the
shackled
seeds
like
the
laughter
of
lightning
like
the
shout
of
a
storm
break
into
the
midst
of
the
noisy
town
free
stifled
word
and
unconscious
effort
reinforce
our
flagging
fight
and
conquer
death
i
have
looked
on
this
picture
in
many
a
month
of
march
when
the
mustard
is
in
bloom
this
lazy
line
of
the
water
and
the
grey
of
the
sand
beyond
the
rough
path
along
the
carrying
the
comradeship
of
the
field
into
the
heart
of
the
village
i
have
tried
to
capture
in
rhyme
the
idle
whistle
of
the
wind
the
beat
of
the
from
a
passing
boat
i
have
wondered
in
my
mind
how
simply
it
stands
before
me
this
great
world
with
what
fond
and
familiar
ease
it
fills
my
heart
this
encounter
with
the
eternal
stranger
the
plies
between
the
two
villages
facing
each
other
across
the
narrow
stream
the
water
is
neither
wide
nor
deep
a
mere
break
in
the
path
that
enhances
the
small
adventures
of
daily
life
like
a
break
in
the
words
of
a
song
across
which
the
tune
gleefully
streams
while
the
towers
of
wealth
rise
high
and
crash
to
ruin
these
villages
talk
to
each
other
across
the
garrulous
stream
and
the
plies
between
them
age
after
age
from
to
harvest
in
the
evening
after
they
have
brought
their
cattle
home
they
sit
on
the
grass
before
their
huts
to
know
that
you
are
among
them
unseen
to
repeat
in
their
songs
the
name
which
they
have
fondly
given
you
while
kings
crowns
shine
and
disappear
like
falling
stars
around
village
huts
your
name
rises
through
the
still
night
from
the
simple
hearts
of
your
lovers
whose
names
are
unrecorded
in
baby
world
the
trees
shake
their
leaves
at
him
murmuring
verses
in
an
ancient
tongue
that
dates
from
before
the
age
of
meaning
and
the
moon
feigns
to
be
of
his
own
age
the
solitary
baby
of
night
in
the
world
of
the
old
flowers
dutifully
blush
at
the
of
faery
legends
and
broken
dolls
confess
that
they
are
made
of
clay
when
i
was
a
child
you
were
a
little
a
loving
timid
stranger
then
you
grew
bold
and
talked
to
me
across
the
fence
offering
me
toys
and
flowers
and
shells
next
you
coaxed
me
away
from
my
work
you
tempted
me
into
the
land
of
the
dusk
or
the
weedy
corner
of
some
garden
in
loneliness
at
length
you
told
me
stories
about
bygone
times
with
which
the
present
ever
longs
to
meet
so
as
to
be
rescued
from
its
prison
in
the
moment
how
often
great
earth
have
i
felt
my
being
yearn
to
flow
over
you
sharing
in
the
happiness
of
each
green
blade
that
raises
its
signal
banner
in
answer
to
the
beckoning
blue
of
the
sky
i
feel
as
if
i
had
belonged
to
you
ages
before
i
was
born
that
is
why
in
the
days
when
the
autumn
light
shimmers
on
the
mellowing
ears
of
rice
i
seem
to
remember
a
past
when
my
mind
was
everywhere
and
even
to
hear
voices
as
of
playfellows
echoing
from
the
remote
and
deeply
veiled
past
when
in
the
evening
the
cattle
return
to
their
folds
raising
dust
from
the
meadow
paths
as
the
moon
rises
higher
than
the
smoke
ascending
from
the
village
huts
i
feel
sad
as
for
some
great
separation
that
happened
in
the
first
morning
of
existence
my
mind
still
buzzed
with
the
cares
of
a
busy
day
i
sat
on
without
noting
how
twilight
was
deepening
into
dark
suddenly
light
stirred
across
the
gloom
and
touched
me
as
with
a
finger
i
lifted
my
head
and
met
the
gaze
of
the
full
moon
widened
in
wonder
like
a
child
it
held
my
eyes
for
long
and
i
felt
as
though
a
had
been
secretly
dropped
in
at
my
window
and
ever
since
my
heart
is
breaking
to
write
for
answer
something
fragrant
as
night
unseen
flowers
great
as
her
declaration
spelt
out
in
nameless
stars
the
clouds
thicken
till
the
morning
light
seems
like
a
bedraggled
fringe
to
the
rainy
night
a
little
girl
stands
at
her
window
still
as
a
rainbow
at
the
gate
of
a
storm
she
is
my
neighbour
and
has
come
upon
the
earth
like
some
god
rebellious
laughter
her
mother
in
anger
calls
her
incorrigible
her
father
smiles
and
calls
her
mad
she
is
like
a
runaway
waterfall
leaping
over
boulders
like
the
topmost
bamboo
twig
rustling
in
the
restless
wind
she
stands
at
her
window
looking
out
into
the
sky
her
sister
comes
to
say
mother
calls
you
she
shakes
her
head
her
little
brother
with
his
toy
boat
comes
and
tries
to
pull
her
off
to
play
she
snatches
her
hand
from
his
the
boy
persists
and
she
gives
him
a
slap
on
the
back
the
first
great
voice
was
the
voice
of
wind
and
water
in
the
beginning
of
earth
creation
that
ancient
cry
of
nature
her
dumb
call
to
unborn
life
has
reached
this
child
heart
and
leads
it
out
alone
beyond
the
fence
of
our
times
so
there
she
stands
possessed
by
eternity
the
kingfisher
sits
still
on
the
prow
of
an
empty
boat
while
in
the
shallow
margin
of
the
stream
a
buffalo
lies
tranquilly
blissful
its
eyes
half
closed
to
savour
the
luxury
of
cool
mud
undismayed
by
the
barking
of
the
village
cur
the
cow
browses
on
the
bank
followed
by
a
hopping
group
of
hunting
moths
i
sit
in
the
tamarind
grove
where
the
cries
of
dumb
life
congregate
the
cattle
lowing
the
sparrows
chatter
the
shrill
scream
of
a
kite
overhead
the
crickets
chirp
and
the
splash
of
a
fish
in
the
water
i
peep
into
the
primeval
nursery
of
life
where
the
mother
earth
thrills
at
the
first
living
clutch
near
her
breast
at
the
sleepy
village
the
noon
was
still
like
a
sunny
midnight
when
my
holidays
came
to
their
end
my
little
girl
of
four
had
followed
me
all
the
morning
from
room
to
room
watching
my
preparations
in
grave
silence
till
wearied
she
sat
by
the
doorpost
strangely
quiet
murmuring
to
herself
father
must
not
go
this
was
the
meal
hour
when
sleep
daily
overcame
her
but
her
mother
had
forgotten
her
and
the
child
was
too
unhappy
to
complain
at
last
when
i
stretched
out
my
arms
to
her
to
say
farewell
she
never
moved
but
sadly
looking
at
me
said
father
you
must
not
go
and
it
amused
me
to
tears
to
think
how
this
little
child
dared
to
fight
the
giant
world
of
necessity
with
no
other
resource
than
those
few
words
father
you
must
not
go
take
your
holiday
my
boy
there
are
the
blue
sky
and
the
bare
field
the
barn
and
the
ruined
temple
under
the
ancient
tamarind
my
holiday
must
be
taken
through
yours
finding
light
in
the
dance
of
your
eyes
music
in
your
noisy
shouts
to
you
autumn
brings
the
true
holiday
freedom
to
me
it
brings
the
impossibility
of
work
for
lo
you
burst
into
my
room
yes
my
holiday
is
an
endless
freedom
for
love
to
disturb
me
in
the
evening
my
little
daughter
heard
a
call
from
her
companions
below
the
window
she
timidly
went
down
the
dark
stairs
holding
a
lamp
in
her
hand
shielding
it
behind
her
veil
i
was
sitting
on
my
terrace
in
the
night
of
march
when
at
a
sudden
cry
i
ran
to
see
her
lamp
had
gone
out
in
the
dark
spiral
staircase
i
asked
child
why
did
you
cry
from
below
she
answered
in
distress
father
i
have
lost
myself
when
i
came
back
to
the
terrace
under
the
night
of
march
i
looked
at
the
sky
and
it
seemed
that
a
child
was
walking
there
treasuring
many
lamps
behind
her
veils
if
their
light
went
out
she
would
suddenly
stop
and
a
cry
would
sound
from
sky
to
sky
father
i
have
lost
myself
the
evening
stood
bewildered
among
street
lamps
its
gold
tarnished
by
the
city
dust
a
woman
gaudily
decked
and
painted
leant
over
the
rail
of
her
balcony
a
living
fire
waiting
for
its
moths
suddenly
an
eddy
was
formed
in
the
road
round
a
crushed
under
the
wheels
of
a
carriage
and
the
woman
on
the
balcony
fell
to
the
floor
screaming
in
agony
stricken
with
the
grief
of
the
great
mother
who
sits
in
the
world
inner
shrine
i
remember
the
scene
on
the
barren
heath
a
girl
sat
alone
on
the
grass
before
the
gipsy
camp
braiding
her
hair
in
the
afternoon
shade
her
little
dog
jumped
and
barked
at
her
busy
hands
as
though
her
employment
had
no
importance
in
vain
did
she
rebuke
it
calling
it
a
pest
saying
she
was
tired
of
its
perpetual
silliness
she
struck
it
on
the
nose
with
her
reproving
forefinger
which
only
seemed
to
delight
it
the
more
she
looked
menacingly
grave
for
a
few
moments
to
warn
it
of
impending
doom
and
then
letting
her
hair
fall
quickly
snatched
it
up
in
her
arms
laughed
and
pressed
it
to
her
heart
he
is
tall
and
lean
withered
to
the
bone
with
long
repeated
fever
like
a
dead
tree
unable
to
draw
a
single
drop
of
sap
from
anywhere
in
despairing
patience
his
mother
carries
him
like
a
child
into
the
sun
where
he
sits
by
the
roadside
in
the
shortening
shadows
of
each
forenoon
the
world
passes
by
a
woman
to
fetch
water
a
with
cattle
to
pasture
a
laden
cart
to
the
distant
market
and
the
mother
hopes
that
some
least
stir
of
life
may
touch
the
awful
torpor
of
her
dying
son
if
the
ragged
villager
trudging
home
from
the
market
could
suddenly
be
lifted
to
the
crest
of
a
distant
age
men
would
stop
in
their
work
and
shout
and
run
to
him
in
delight
for
they
would
no
longer
whittle
down
the
man
into
the
peasant
but
find
him
full
of
the
mystery
and
spirit
of
his
age
even
his
poverty
and
pain
would
grow
great
released
from
the
shallow
insult
of
the
present
and
the
paltry
things
in
his
basket
would
acquire
pathetic
dignity
with
the
morning
he
came
out
to
walk
a
road
shaded
by
a
file
of
deodars
that
coiled
the
hill
round
like
importunate
love
he
held
the
first
letter
from
his
newly
wedded
wife
in
their
village
home
begging
him
to
come
to
her
and
come
soon
the
touch
of
an
absent
hand
haunted
him
as
he
walked
and
the
air
seemed
to
take
up
the
cry
of
the
letter
love
my
love
my
sky
is
brimming
with
tears
he
asked
himself
in
wonder
how
do
i
deserve
this
the
sun
suddenly
appeared
over
the
rim
of
the
blue
hills
and
four
girls
from
a
foreign
shore
came
with
swift
strides
talking
loud
and
followed
by
a
barking
dog
the
two
elder
turned
away
to
conceal
their
amusement
at
something
strange
in
his
insignificance
and
the
younger
ones
pushed
each
other
laughed
aloud
and
ran
off
in
exuberant
mirth
he
stopped
and
his
head
sank
then
he
suddenly
felt
his
letter
opened
and
read
it
again
the
day
came
for
the
image
from
the
temple
to
be
drawn
round
the
holy
town
in
its
chariot
the
queen
said
to
the
king
let
us
go
and
attend
the
festival
only
one
man
out
of
the
whole
household
did
not
join
in
the
pilgrimage
his
work
was
to
collect
stalks
of
to
make
brooms
for
the
house
the
chief
of
the
servants
said
in
pity
to
him
you
may
come
with
us
he
bowed
his
head
saying
it
can
not
be
the
man
dwelt
by
the
road
along
which
the
king
followers
had
to
pass
and
when
the
minister
elephant
reached
this
spot
he
called
to
him
and
said
come
with
us
and
see
the
god
ride
in
his
chariot
i
dare
not
seek
god
after
the
king
fashion
said
the
man
how
should
you
ever
have
such
luck
again
as
to
see
the
god
in
his
chariot
asked
the
minister
when
god
himself
comes
to
my
door
answered
the
man
the
minister
laughed
loud
and
said
fool
god
comes
to
your
door
yet
a
king
must
travel
to
see
him
who
except
god
visits
the
poor
said
the
man
days
were
drawing
out
as
the
winter
ended
and
in
the
sun
my
dog
played
in
his
wild
way
with
the
pet
deer
the
crowd
going
to
the
market
gathered
by
the
fence
and
laughed
to
see
the
love
of
these
playmates
struggle
with
languages
so
dissimilar
the
spring
was
in
the
air
and
the
young
leaves
fluttered
like
flames
a
gleam
danced
in
the
deer
dark
eyes
when
she
started
bent
her
neck
at
the
movement
of
her
own
shadow
or
raised
her
ears
to
listen
to
some
whisper
in
the
wind
the
message
comes
floating
with
the
errant
breeze
with
the
rustle
and
glimmer
abroad
in
the
april
sky
it
sings
of
the
first
ache
of
youth
in
the
world
when
the
first
flower
broke
from
the
bud
and
love
went
forth
seeking
that
which
it
knew
not
leaving
all
it
had
known
and
one
afternoon
when
among
the
trees
the
shadow
grew
grave
and
sweet
with
the
furtive
caress
of
light
the
deer
set
off
to
run
like
a
meteor
in
love
with
death
it
grew
dark
and
lamps
were
lighted
in
the
house
the
stars
came
out
and
night
was
upon
the
fields
but
the
deer
never
came
back
my
dog
ran
up
to
me
whining
questioning
me
with
his
piteous
eyes
which
seemed
to
say
i
do
not
understand
but
who
does
ever
understand
our
lane
is
tortuous
as
if
ages
ago
she
started
in
quest
of
her
goal
vacillated
right
and
left
and
remained
bewildered
for
ever
above
in
the
air
between
her
buildings
hangs
like
a
ribbon
a
strip
torn
out
of
space
she
calls
it
her
sister
of
the
blue
town
she
sees
the
sun
only
for
a
few
moments
at
and
asks
herself
in
wise
doubt
is
it
real
in
june
rain
sometimes
shades
her
band
of
daylight
as
with
pencil
hatchings
the
path
grows
slippery
with
mud
and
umbrellas
collide
sudden
jets
of
water
from
spouts
overhead
splash
on
her
startled
pavement
in
her
dismay
she
takes
it
for
the
jest
of
an
unmannerly
scheme
of
creation
the
spring
breeze
gone
astray
in
her
coil
of
contortions
stumbles
like
a
drunken
vagabond
against
angle
and
corner
filling
the
dusty
air
with
scraps
of
paper
and
rag
what
fury
of
foolishness
are
the
gods
gone
mad
she
exclaims
in
indignation
but
the
daily
refuse
from
the
houses
on
both
sides
scales
of
fish
mixed
with
ashes
vegetable
peelings
rotten
fruit
and
dead
rats
never
rouse
her
to
question
why
should
these
things
be
she
accepts
every
stone
of
her
paving
but
from
between
their
chinks
sometimes
a
blade
of
grass
peeps
up
that
baffles
her
how
can
solid
facts
permit
such
intrusion
on
a
morning
when
at
the
touch
of
autumn
light
her
houses
wake
up
into
beauty
from
their
foul
dreams
she
whispers
to
herself
there
is
a
limitless
wonder
somewhere
beyond
these
buildings
but
the
hours
pass
on
the
households
are
astir
the
maid
strolls
back
from
the
market
swinging
her
right
arm
and
with
the
left
clasping
the
basket
of
provisions
to
her
side
the
air
grows
thick
with
the
smell
and
smoke
of
kitchens
it
again
becomes
clear
to
our
lane
that
the
real
and
normal
consist
solely
of
herself
her
houses
and
their
the
house
lingering
on
after
its
wealth
has
vanished
stands
by
the
wayside
like
a
madman
with
a
patched
rag
over
his
back
day
after
day
scars
it
with
spiteful
scratches
and
rainy
months
leave
their
fantastic
signatures
on
its
bared
bricks
in
a
deserted
upper
room
one
of
a
pair
of
doors
has
fallen
from
rusty
hinges
and
the
other
widowed
bangs
day
and
night
to
the
fitful
gusts
one
night
the
sound
of
women
wailing
came
from
that
house
they
mourned
the
death
of
the
last
son
of
the
family
a
boy
of
eighteen
who
earned
his
living
by
playing
the
part
of
the
heroine
in
a
travelling
theatre
a
few
days
more
and
the
house
became
silent
and
all
the
doors
were
locked
only
on
the
north
side
in
the
upper
room
that
desolate
door
would
neither
drop
off
to
its
rest
nor
be
shut
but
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
wind
like
a
soul
after
a
time
children
voices
echo
once
more
through
that
house
over
the
women
clothes
are
hung
in
the
sun
a
bird
whistles
from
a
covered
cage
and
a
boy
plays
with
his
kite
on
the
terrace
a
tenant
has
come
to
occupy
a
few
rooms
he
earns
little
and
has
many
children
the
tired
mother
beats
them
and
they
roll
on
the
floor
and
shriek
a
of
forty
drudges
through
the
day
quarrels
with
her
mistress
threatens
to
but
never
leaves
every
day
some
small
repairs
are
done
paper
is
pasted
in
place
of
missing
panes
gaps
in
the
railings
are
made
good
with
split
bamboo
an
empty
box
keeps
the
boltless
gate
shut
old
stains
vaguely
show
through
new
whitewash
on
the
walls
the
magnificence
of
wealth
had
found
a
fitting
memorial
in
gaunt
desolation
but
lacking
sufficient
means
they
try
to
hide
this
with
dubious
devices
and
its
dignity
is
outraged
they
have
overlooked
the
deserted
room
on
the
north
side
and
its
forlorn
door
still
bangs
in
the
wind
like
despair
beating
her
breast
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
ascetic
practised
penance
with
eyes
he
intended
to
deserve
paradise
but
the
girl
who
gathered
twigs
brought
him
fruits
in
her
skirt
and
water
from
the
stream
in
cups
made
of
leaves
the
days
went
on
and
his
penance
grew
harsher
till
the
fruits
remained
untasted
the
water
untouched
and
the
girl
who
gathered
twigs
was
sad
the
lord
of
paradise
heard
that
a
man
had
dared
to
aspire
to
be
as
the
gods
time
after
time
he
had
fought
the
titans
who
were
his
peers
and
kept
them
out
of
his
kingdom
yet
he
feared
a
man
whose
power
was
that
of
suffering
but
he
knew
the
ways
of
mortals
and
he
planned
a
temptation
to
decoy
this
creature
of
dust
away
from
his
adventure
a
breath
from
paradise
kissed
the
limbs
of
the
girl
who
gathered
twigs
and
her
youth
ached
with
a
sudden
rapture
of
beauty
and
her
thoughts
hummed
like
the
bees
of
a
rifled
hive
the
time
came
when
the
ascetic
should
leave
the
forest
for
a
mountain
cave
to
complete
the
rigour
of
his
penance
when
he
opened
his
eyes
in
order
to
start
on
this
journey
the
girl
appeared
to
him
like
a
verse
familiar
yet
forgotten
and
which
an
added
melody
made
strange
the
ascetic
rose
from
his
seat
and
told
her
that
it
was
time
he
left
the
forest
but
why
rob
me
of
my
chance
to
serve
you
she
asked
with
tears
in
her
eyes
he
sat
down
again
thought
for
long
and
remained
on
where
he
was
that
night
remorse
kept
the
girl
awake
she
began
to
dread
her
power
and
hate
her
triumph
yet
her
mind
tossed
on
the
waves
of
turbulent
delight
in
the
morning
she
came
and
saluted
the
ascetic
and
asked
his
blessing
saying
she
must
leave
him
he
gazed
on
her
face
in
silence
then
said
go
and
may
your
wish
be
fulfilled
for
years
he
sat
alone
till
his
penance
was
complete
the
lord
of
the
immortals
came
down
to
tell
him
that
he
had
won
paradise
i
no
longer
need
it
said
he
the
god
asked
him
what
greater
reward
he
desired
i
want
the
girl
who
gathers
twigs
they
said
that
kabir
the
weaver
was
favoured
of
god
and
the
crowd
flocked
round
him
for
medicine
and
miracles
but
he
was
troubled
his
low
birth
had
hitherto
endowed
him
with
a
most
precious
obscurity
to
sweeten
with
songs
and
with
the
presence
of
his
god
he
prayed
that
it
might
be
restored
envious
of
the
repute
of
this
outcast
the
priests
leagued
themselves
with
a
harlot
to
disgrace
him
kabir
came
to
the
market
to
sell
cloths
from
his
loom
when
the
woman
grasped
his
hand
blaming
him
for
being
faithless
and
followed
him
to
his
house
saying
she
would
not
be
forsaken
kabir
said
to
himself
god
answers
prayers
in
his
own
way
soon
the
woman
felt
a
shiver
of
fear
and
fell
on
her
knees
and
cried
save
me
from
my
sin
to
which
he
said
open
your
life
to
god
light
kabir
worked
at
his
loom
and
sang
and
his
songs
washed
the
stains
from
that
woman
heart
and
by
way
of
return
found
a
home
in
her
sweet
voice
one
day
the
king
in
a
fit
of
caprice
sent
a
message
to
kabir
to
come
and
sing
before
him
the
weaver
shook
his
head
but
the
messenger
dared
not
leave
his
door
till
his
master
errand
was
fulfilled
the
king
and
his
courtiers
started
at
the
sight
of
kabir
when
he
entered
the
hall
for
he
was
not
alone
the
woman
followed
him
some
smiled
some
frowned
and
the
king
face
darkened
at
the
beggar
pride
and
shamelessness
kabir
came
back
to
his
house
disgraced
the
woman
fell
at
his
feet
crying
why
accept
such
dishonour
for
my
sake
master
suffer
me
to
go
back
to
my
infamy
kabir
said
i
dare
not
turn
my
god
away
when
he
comes
branded
with
insult
somaka
and
ritvik
somaka
and
ritvik
shade
king
somaka
to
heaven
in
a
chariot
passes
other
shades
by
the
roadside
among
them
that
ritvik
former
a
voice
where
would
you
go
king
somaka
whose
voice
is
that
this
turbid
air
is
like
suffocation
to
the
eyes
i
can
not
see
the
voice
come
down
king
come
down
from
that
chariot
bound
for
heaven
somaka
who
are
you
the
voice
i
am
ritvik
who
in
my
earthly
life
was
your
preceptor
and
the
chief
priest
of
your
house
somaka
master
all
the
tears
of
the
world
seem
to
have
become
vapour
to
create
this
realm
of
vagueness
what
make
you
here
shades
this
hell
lies
hard
by
the
road
to
heaven
whence
lights
glimmer
dimly
only
to
prove
unapproachable
day
and
night
we
listen
to
the
heavenly
chariot
rumbling
by
with
travellers
for
that
region
of
bliss
it
drives
sleep
from
our
eyes
and
forces
them
to
watch
in
fruitless
jealousy
far
below
us
earth
old
forests
rustle
and
her
seas
chant
the
primal
hymn
of
creation
they
sound
like
the
wail
of
a
memory
that
wanders
void

in
vain
ritvik

down
king
shades
stop
a
few
moments
among
us
the
earth
tears
still
cling
about
you
like
dew
on
freshly
culled
flowers
you
have
brought
with
you
the
mingled
odours
of
meadow
and
forest
reminiscence
of
children
women
and
comrades
something
too
of
the
ineffable
music
of
the
seasons
somaka
master
why
are
you
doomed
to
live
in
this
muffled
stagnant
world
ritvik
i
offered
up
your
son
in
the
sacrificial
fire
sin
has
lodged
my
soul
in
this
obscurity
shades
king
tell
us
the
story
we
implore
you
the
recital
of
crime
can
still
bring
life
fire
into
our
torpor
somaka
i
was
named
somaka
the
king
of
videha
after
sacrificing
at
innumerable
shrines
weary
year
on
year
a
son
was
born
to
my
house
in
my
old
age
love
for
whom
like
a
sudden
untimely
flood
swept
consideration
for
everything
else
from
my
life
he
hid
me
completely
as
a
lotus
hides
its
stem
the
neglected
duties
of
a
king
piled
up
in
shame
before
my
throne
one
day
in
my
audience
hall
i
heard
my
child
cry
from
his
mother
room
and
instantly
rushed
away
vacating
my
throne
ritvik
just
then
it
chanced
i
entered
the
hall
to
give
him
my
daily
benediction
in
blind
haste
he
brushed
me
aside
and
enkindled
my
anger
when
later
he
came
back
i
asked
him
king
what
desperate
alarm
could
draw
you
at
the
busiest
hour
of
the
day
to
the
women
apartments
so
as
to
desert
your
dignity
and
duty
ambassadors
come
from
friendly
courts
the
aggrieved
who
ask
for
justice
your
ministers
waiting
to
discuss
matters
of
grave
import
and
even
lead
you
to
slight
a
brahmin
blessing
somaka
at
first
my
heart
flamed
with
anger
the
next
moment
i
trampled
it
down
like
the
raised
head
of
a
snake
and
meekly
replied
having
only
one
child
i
have
lost
my
peace
of
mind
forgive
me
this
once
and
i
promise
that
in
future
the
father
infatuation
shall
never
usurp
the
king
ritvik
but
my
heart
was
bitter
with
resentment
and
i
said
if
you
must
be
delivered
from
the
curse
of
having
only
one
child
i
can
show
you
the
way
but
so
hard
is
it
that
i
feel
certain
you
will
fail
to
follow
it
this
galled
the
king
pride
and
he
stood
up
and
exclaimed
i
swear
by
all
that
is
sacred
as
a
kshatriya
and
a
king
i
will
not
shrink
but
perform
whatever
you
may
ask
however
hard
then
listen
said
i
light
a
sacrificial
fire
offer
up
your
son
the
smoke
that
rises
will
bring
you
progeny
as
the
clouds
bring
rain
the
king
bowed
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
remained
silent
the
courtiers
shouted
their
horror
the
brahmins
clapped
their
hands
over
their
ears
crying
sin
it
is
both
to
utter
and
listen
to
such
words
after
some
moments
of
bewildered
dismay
the
king
calmly
said
i
will
abide
by
my
promise
the
day
came
the
fire
was
lit
the
town
was
emptied
of
its
people
the
child
was
called
for
but
the
attendants
refused
to
obey
the
soldiers
rebelliously
went
off
duty
throwing
down
their
arms
then
i
who
in
my
wisdom
had
soared
far
above
all
weakness
of
heart
and
to
whom
emotions
were
illusory
went
myself
to
the
apartment
where
with
their
arms
women
fenced
the
child
like
a
flower
surrounded
by
the
menacing
branches
of
a
tree
he
saw
me
and
stretched
out
eager
hands
and
struggled
to
come
to
me
for
he
longed
to
be
free
from
the
love
that
imprisoned
him
crying
i
am
come
to
give
you
true
deliverance
i
snatched
him
by
force
from
his
fainting
mother
and
his
nurses
wailing
in
despair
with
quivering
tongues
the
fire
licked
the
sky
and
the
king
stood
beside
it
still
and
silent
like
a
tree
struck
dead
by
lightning
fascinated
by
the
godlike
splendour
of
the
blaze
the
child
babbled
in
glee
and
danced
in
my
arms
impatient
to
seek
an
unknown
nurse
in
the
free
glory
of
those
flames
somaka
stop
no
more
i
pray
shades
ritvik
your
presence
is
a
disgrace
to
hell
itself
the
charioteer
this
is
no
place
for
you
king
nor
have
you
deserved
to
be
forced
to
listen
to
this
recital
of
a
deed
which
makes
hell
shudder
in
pity
somaka
drive
off
in
your
chariot
brahmin
my
place
is
by
you
in
this
hell
the
gods
may
forget
my
sin
but
can
i
forget
the
last
look
of
agonised
surprise
on
my
child
face
when
for
one
terrible
moment
he
realised
that
his
own
father
had
betrayed
his
trust
dharma
judge
of
departed
dharma
king
heaven
waits
for
you
somaka
no
not
for
me
i
killed
my
own
child
dharma
your
sin
has
been
swept
away
in
the
fury
of
pain
it
caused
you
ritvik
no
king
you
must
never
go
to
heaven
alone
and
thus
create
a
second
hell
for
me
to
burn
both
with
fire
and
with
hatred
of
you
stay
here
somaka
i
will
stay
shades
and
crown
the
despair
and
inglorious
suffering
of
hell
with
the
triumph
of
a
soul
the
man
had
no
useful
work
only
vagaries
of
various
kinds
therefore
it
surprised
him
to
find
himself
in
paradise
after
a
life
spent
perfecting
trifles
now
the
guide
had
taken
him
by
mistake
to
the
wrong
paradise
one
meant
only
for
good
busy
souls
in
this
paradise
our
man
saunters
along
the
road
only
to
obstruct
the
rush
of
business
he
stands
aside
from
the
path
and
is
warned
that
he
tramples
on
sown
seed
pushed
he
starts
up
hustled
he
moves
on
a
very
busy
girl
comes
to
fetch
water
from
the
well
her
feet
run
on
the
pavement
like
rapid
fingers
over
hastily
she
ties
a
negligent
knot
with
her
hair
and
loose
locks
on
her
forehead
pry
into
the
dark
of
her
eyes
the
man
says
to
her
would
you
lend
me
your
pitcher
my
pitcher
she
asks
to
draw
water
no
to
paint
patterns
on
i
have
no
time
to
waste
the
girl
retorts
in
contempt
now
a
busy
soul
has
no
chance
against
one
who
is
supremely
idle
every
day
she
meets
him
at
the
well
and
every
day
he
repeats
the
same
request
till
at
last
she
yields
our
man
paints
the
pitcher
with
curious
colours
in
a
mysterious
maze
of
lines
the
girl
takes
it
up
turns
it
round
and
asks
what
does
it
mean
it
has
no
meaning
he
answers
the
girl
carries
the
pitcher
home
she
holds
it
up
in
different
lights
and
tries
to
con
its
mystery
at
night
she
leaves
her
bed
lights
a
lamp
and
gazes
at
it
from
all
points
of
view
this
is
the
first
time
she
has
met
with
something
without
meaning
on
the
next
day
the
man
is
again
near
the
well
the
girl
asks
what
do
you
want
to
do
more
work
for
you
what
work
she
enquires
allow
me
to
weave
coloured
strands
into
a
ribbon
to
bind
your
hair
is
there
any
need
she
asks
none
whatever
he
allows
the
ribbon
is
made
and
she
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
over
her
hair
the
even
stretch
of
time
in
that
paradise
begins
to
show
irregular
rents
the
elders
are
troubled
they
meet
in
council
the
guide
confesses
his
blunder
saying
that
he
has
brought
the
wrong
man
to
the
wrong
place
the
wrong
man
is
called
his
turban
flaming
with
colour
shows
plainly
how
great
that
blunder
has
been
the
chief
of
the
elders
says
you
must
go
back
to
the
earth
the
man
heaves
a
sigh
of
relief
i
am
ready
the
girl
with
the
ribbon
round
her
hair
chimes
in
i
also
for
the
first
time
the
chief
of
the
elders
is
faced
with
a
situation
which
has
no
sense
in
it
it
is
said
that
in
the
forest
near
the
meeting
of
river
and
lake
certain
fairies
live
in
disguise
who
are
only
recognised
as
fairies
after
they
have
flown
away
a
prince
went
to
this
forest
and
when
he
came
where
river
met
lake
he
saw
a
village
girl
sitting
on
the
bank
ruffling
the
water
to
make
the
lilies
dance
he
asked
her
in
a
whisper
tell
me
what
fairy
art
thou
the
girl
laughed
at
the
question
and
the
hillsides
echoed
her
mirth
the
prince
thought
she
was
the
laughing
fairy
of
the
waterfall
news
reached
the
king
that
the
prince
had
married
a
fairy
he
sent
horses
and
men
and
brought
them
to
his
house
the
queen
saw
the
bride
and
turned
her
face
away
in
disgust
the
sister
flushed
red
with
annoyance
and
the
maids
asked
if
that
was
how
fairies
dressed
the
prince
whispered
hush
my
fairy
has
come
to
our
house
in
disguise
on
the
day
of
the
yearly
festival
the
queen
said
to
her
son
ask
your
bride
not
to
shame
us
before
our
kinsfolk
who
are
coming
to
see
the
fairy
and
the
prince
said
to
his
bride
for
my
love
sake
show
thy
true
self
to
my
people
long
she
sat
silent
then
nodded
her
promise
while
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
the
full
moon
shone
the
prince
dressed
in
a
wedding
robe
entered
his
bride
room
no
one
was
there
nothing
but
a
streak
of
moonlight
from
the
window
aslant
the
bed
the
kinsfolk
crowded
in
with
the
king
and
the
queen
the
prince
sister
stood
by
the
door
all
asked
where
is
the
fairy
bride
the
prince
answered
she
has
vanished
for
ever
to
make
herself
known
to
you
karna
and
kunti
karna
and
kunti
pandava
queen
kunti
before
marriage
had
a
son
karna
who
in
manhood
became
the
commander
of
the
kaurava
host
to
hide
her
shame
she
abandoned
him
at
birth
and
a
charioteer
adhiratha
brought
him
up
as
his
karna
i
am
karna
the
son
of
the
charioteer
adhiratha
and
i
sit
here
by
the
bank
of
holy
ganges
to
worship
the
setting
sun
tell
me
who
you
are
kunti
i
am
the
woman
who
first
made
you
acquainted
with
that
light
you
are
worshipping
karna
i
do
not
understand
but
your
eyes
melt
my
heart
as
the
kiss
of
the
morning
sun
melts
the
snow
on
a
and
your
voice
rouses
a
blind
sadness
within
me
of
which
the
cause
may
well
lie
beyond
the
reach
of
my
earliest
memory
tell
me
strange
woman
what
mystery
binds
my
birth
to
you
kunti
patience
my
son
i
will
answer
when
the
lids
of
darkness
come
down
over
the
prying
eyes
of
day
in
the
meanwhile
know
that
i
am
kunti
karna
kunti
the
mother
of
arjuna
kunti
yes
indeed
the
mother
of
arjuna
your
antagonist
but
do
not
therefore
hate
me
i
still
remember
the
day
of
the
trial
of
arms
in
hastina
when
you
an
unknown
boy
boldly
stepped
into
the
arena
like
the
first
ray
of
dawn
among
the
stars
of
night
ah
who
was
that
unhappy
woman
whose
eyes
kissed
your
bare
slim
body
through
tears
that
blessed
you
where
she
sat
among
the
women
of
the
royal
household
behind
the
arras
why
the
mother
of
arjuna
then
the
brahmin
master
of
arms
stepped
forth
and
said
no
youth
of
mean
birth
may
challenge
arjuna
to
a
trial
of
strength
you
stood
speechless
like
a
at
sunset
flashing
with
an
agony
of
suppressed
light
but
who
was
the
woman
whose
heart
caught
fire
from
your
shame
and
anger
and
flared
up
in
silence
the
mother
of
arjuna
praised
be
duryodhana
who
perceived
your
worth
and
then
and
there
crowned
you
king
of
anga
thus
winning
the
kauravas
a
champion
overwhelmed
at
this
good
fortune
adhiratha
the
charioteer
broke
through
the
crowd
you
instantly
rushed
to
him
and
laid
your
crown
at
his
feet
amid
the
jeering
laughter
of
the
pandavas
and
their
friends
but
there
was
one
woman
of
the
pandava
house
whose
heart
glowed
with
joy
at
the
heroic
pride
of
such
humility
even
the
mother
of
arjuna
karna
but
what
brings
you
here
alone
mother
of
kings
kunti
i
have
a
boon
to
crave
karna
command
me
and
whatever
manhood
and
my
honour
as
a
kshatriya
permit
shall
be
offered
at
your
feet
kunti
i
have
come
to
take
you
karna
where
kunti
to
my
breast
thirsting
for
your
love
my
son
karna
fortunate
mother
of
five
brave
kings
where
can
you
find
place
for
me
a
small
chieftain
of
lowly
descent
kunti
your
place
is
before
all
my
other
sons
karna
but
what
right
have
i
to
take
it
kunti
your
own
right
to
your
mother
love
karna
the
gloom
of
evening
spreads
over
the
earth
silence
rests
on
the
water
and
your
voice
leads
me
back
to
some
primal
world
of
infancy
lost
in
twilit
consciousness
however
whether
this
be
dream
or
fragment
of
forgotten
reality
come
near
and
place
your
right
hand
on
my
forehead
rumour
runs
that
i
was
deserted
by
my
mother
many
a
night
she
has
come
to
me
in
my
slumber
but
when
i
cried
open
your
veil
show
me
your
face
her
figure
always
vanished
has
this
same
dream
come
this
evening
while
i
wake
see
yonder
the
lamps
are
lighted
in
your
son
tents
across
the
river
and
on
this
side
behold
the
of
my
kauravas
like
the
suspended
waves
of
a
storm
at
sea
before
the
din
of
tomorrow
battle
in
the
awful
hush
of
this
field
where
it
must
be
fought
why
should
the
voice
of
the
mother
of
my
opponent
arjuna
bring
me
a
message
of
forgotten
motherhood
and
why
should
my
name
take
such
music
from
her
tongue
as
to
draw
my
heart
out
to
him
and
his
brothers
kunti
then
delay
not
my
son
come
with
me
karna
yes
i
will
come
and
never
ask
question
never
doubt
my
soul
responds
to
your
call
and
the
struggle
for
victory
and
fame
and
the
rage
of
hatred
have
suddenly
become
untrue
to
me
as
the
delirious
dream
of
a
night
in
the
serenity
of
the
dawn
tell
me
whither
you
mean
to
lead
kunti
to
the
other
bank
of
the
river
where
those
lamps
burn
across
the
ghastly
pallor
of
the
sands
karna
am
i
there
to
find
my
lost
mother
for
ever
kunti
o
my
son
karna
then
why
did
you
banish
me
a
castaway
uprooted
from
my
ancestral
soil
adrift
in
a
homeless
current
of
indignity
why
set
a
bottomless
chasm
between
arjuna
and
myself
turning
the
natural
attachment
of
kinship
to
the
dread
attraction
of
hate
you
remain
speechless
your
shame
permeates
the
vast
darkness
and
sends
invisible
shivers
through
my
limbs
leave
my
question
unanswered
never
explain
to
me
what
made
you
rob
your
son
of
his
mother
love
only
tell
me
why
you
have
come
to
call
me
back
to
the
ruins
of
a
heaven
wrecked
by
your
own
hands
kunti
i
am
dogged
by
a
curse
more
deadly
than
your
reproaches
for
though
surrounded
by
five
sons
my
heart
shrivels
like
that
of
a
woman
deprived
of
her
children
through
the
great
rent
that
yawned
for
my
deserted
all
my
life
pleasures
have
run
to
waste
on
that
accursed
day
when
i
belied
my
motherhood
you
could
not
utter
a
word
your
recreant
mother
implores
you
for
generous
words
let
your
forgiveness
burn
her
heart
like
fire
and
consume
its
sin
karna
mother
accept
my
tears
kunti
i
did
not
come
with
the
hope
of
winning
you
back
to
my
arms
but
with
that
of
restoring
your
rights
to
you
come
and
receive
as
a
king
son
your
due
among
your
brothers
karna
i
am
more
truly
the
son
of
a
charioteer
and
do
not
covet
the
glory
of
greater
parentage
kunti
be
that
as
it
may
come
and
win
back
the
kingdom
which
is
yours
by
right
karna
must
you
who
once
refused
me
a
mother
love
tempt
me
with
a
kingdom
the
quick
bond
of
kindred
which
you
severed
at
its
root
is
dead
and
can
never
grow
again
shame
were
mine
should
i
hasten
to
call
the
mother
of
kings
mother
and
abandon
mother
in
the
charioteer
house
kunti
you
are
great
my
son
how
god
punishment
invisibly
grows
from
a
tiny
seed
to
a
giant
life
the
helpless
babe
disowned
by
his
mother
comes
back
a
man
through
the
dark
maze
of
events
to
smite
his
brothers
karna
mother
have
no
fear
i
know
for
certain
that
victory
awaits
the
pandavas
peaceful
and
still
though
this
night
be
my
heart
is
full
of
the
music
of
a
hopeless
venture
and
baffled
end
ask
me
not
to
leave
those
who
are
doomed
to
defeat
let
the
pandavas
win
the
throne
since
they
must
i
remain
with
the
desperate
and
forlorn
on
the
night
of
my
birth
you
left
me
naked
and
unnamed
to
disgrace
leave
me
once
again
without
pity
to
the
calm
expectation
of
defeat
and
death
when
like
a
flaming
scimitar
the
hill
stream
has
been
sheathed
in
gloom
by
the
evening
suddenly
a
flock
of
birds
passes
overhead
their
wings
hurling
their
flight
like
an
arrow
among
stars
it
startles
a
passion
for
speed
in
the
heart
of
all
motionless
things
the
hills
seem
to
feel
in
their
bosom
the
anguish
of
and
trees
long
to
break
their
rooted
shackles
for
me
the
flight
of
these
birds
has
rent
a
veil
of
stillness
and
reveals
an
immense
flutter
in
this
deep
silence
i
see
these
hills
and
forests
fly
across
time
to
the
unknown
and
darkness
thrill
into
fire
as
the
stars
wing
by
i
feel
in
my
own
being
the
rush
of
the
bird
cleaving
a
way
beyond
the
limits
of
life
and
death
while
the
migrant
world
cries
with
a
myriad
voices
not
here
but
somewhere
else
in
the
bosom
of
the
faraway
the
crowd
listens
in
wonder
to
kashi
the
young
singer
whose
voice
like
a
sword
in
feats
of
skill
dances
amidst
hopeless
tangles
cuts
them
to
pieces
and
exults
among
the
hearers
sits
old
rajah
pratap
in
weary
endurance
for
his
own
life
had
been
nourished
and
encircled
by
barajlal
songs
like
a
happy
land
which
a
river
laces
with
beauty
his
rainy
evenings
and
the
still
hours
of
autumn
days
spoke
to
his
heart
through
barajlal
voice
and
his
festive
nights
trimmed
their
lamps
and
tinkled
their
bells
to
those
songs
when
kashi
stopped
for
rest
pratap
smilingly
winked
at
barajlal
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
whisper
master
now
let
us
hear
music
and
not
this
singing
which
mimics
frisky
kittens
hunting
paralysed
mice
the
old
singer
with
his
spotlessly
white
turban
made
a
deep
bow
to
the
assembly
and
took
his
seat
his
thin
fingers
struck
the
strings
of
his
instrument
his
eyes
closed
and
in
timid
hesitation
his
song
began
the
hall
was
large
his
voice
feeble
and
pratap
shouted
bravo
with
ostentation
but
whispered
in
his
ear
just
a
little
louder
friend
the
crowd
was
restless
some
yawned
some
dozed
some
complained
of
the
heat
the
air
of
the
hall
hummed
with
inattention
and
the
song
like
a
frail
boat
tossed
upon
it
in
vain
till
it
sank
under
the
hubbub
suddenly
the
old
man
stricken
at
heart
forgot
a
passage
and
his
voice
groped
in
agony
like
a
blind
man
at
a
fair
for
his
lost
leader
he
tried
to
fill
the
gap
with
any
strain
that
came
but
the
gap
still
yawned
and
the
tortured
notes
refused
to
serve
the
need
suddenly
changed
their
tune
and
broke
into
a
sob
the
master
laid
his
head
on
his
instrument
and
in
place
of
his
forgotten
music
there
broke
from
him
the
first
cry
of
life
that
a
child
brings
into
the
world
pratap
touched
him
gently
on
his
shoulder
and
said
come
away
our
meeting
is
elsewhere
i
know
my
friend
that
truth
is
widowed
without
love
and
beauty
dwells
not
with
the
many
nor
in
the
moment
in
the
youth
of
the
world
himalaya
you
sprang
from
the
rent
breast
of
the
earth
and
hurled
your
burning
challenges
to
the
sun
hill
after
hill
then
came
the
mellow
time
when
you
said
to
yourself
no
more
no
further
and
your
fiery
heart
that
raged
for
the
freedom
of
clouds
found
its
limits
and
stood
still
to
salute
the
limitless
after
this
check
on
your
passion
beauty
was
free
to
play
upon
your
breast
and
trust
surrounded
you
with
the
joy
of
flowers
and
birds
you
sit
in
your
solitude
like
a
great
reader
on
whose
lap
lies
open
some
ancient
book
with
its
countless
pages
of
stone
what
story
is
written
there
i
wonder
is
it
the
eternal
wedding
of
the
divine
ascetic
shiva
with
bhavani
the
divine
love
the
drama
of
the
terrible
wooing
the
power
of
the
frail
i
feel
that
my
heart
will
leave
its
own
colour
in
all
your
scenes
o
earth
when
i
bid
you
farewell
some
notes
of
mine
will
be
added
to
your
melody
and
my
thoughts
will
breathe
unrecognised
through
the
cycle
of
shadows
and
sunshine
in
days
summer
will
come
to
the
lovers
garden
but
they
will
not
know
that
their
flowers
have
borrowed
an
added
beauty
from
my
songs
nor
that
their
love
for
this
world
has
been
deepened
by
mine
my
eyes
feel
the
deep
peace
of
this
sky
and
there
stirs
through
me
what
a
tree
feels
when
it
holds
out
its
leaves
like
cups
to
be
filled
with
sunshine
a
thought
rises
in
my
mind
like
the
warm
breath
from
grass
in
the
sun
it
mingles
with
the
gurgle
of
lapping
water
and
the
sigh
of
weary
wind
in
village
lanes
the
thought
that
i
have
lived
along
with
the
whole
life
of
this
world
and
have
given
to
it
my
own
love
and
sorrows
i
ask
no
reward
for
the
songs
i
sang
you
i
shall
be
content
if
they
live
through
the
night
until
dawn
like
a
calls
away
the
stars
in
alarm
at
the
sun
but
there
were
moments
when
you
sang
your
songs
to
me
and
as
my
pride
knows
my
poet
you
will
ever
remember
that
i
listened
and
lost
my
heart
in
the
morning
when
the
dew
glistened
upon
the
grass
you
came
and
gave
a
push
to
my
swing
but
sweeping
from
smiles
to
tears
i
did
not
know
you
then
came
april
noon
of
gorgeous
light
and
i
think
you
beckoned
me
to
follow
you
but
when
i
sought
your
face
there
passed
between
us
the
procession
of
flowers
and
men
and
women
flinging
their
songs
to
the
south
wind
daily
i
passed
you
unheeded
on
the
road
but
on
some
days
full
of
the
faint
smell
of
oleanders
when
the
wind
was
wilful
among
complaining
palm
leaves
i
would
stand
before
you
wondering
if
you
ever
had
been
a
stranger
to
me
the
day
grew
dim
the
early
evening
star
faltered
near
the
edge
of
a
grey
lonely
sky
i
looked
back
and
felt
that
the
road
lying
behind
me
was
infinitely
removed
traced
through
my
life
it
had
only
served
for
a
single
journey
and
was
never
to
be
the
long
story
of
my
coming
hither
lies
there
dumb
in
one
meandering
line
of
dust
stretching
from
the
morning
hilltop
to
the
brink
of
bottomless
night
i
sit
alone
and
wonder
if
this
road
is
like
an
instrument
waiting
to
give
up
the
day
lost
voices
in
music
when
touched
by
divine
fingers
at
nightfall
give
me
the
supreme
courage
of
love
this
is
my
prayer
the
courage
to
speak
to
do
to
suffer
at
thy
will
to
leave
all
things
or
be
left
alone
strengthen
me
on
errands
of
danger
honour
me
with
pain
and
help
me
climb
to
that
difficult
mood
which
sacrifices
daily
to
thee
give
me
the
supreme
confidence
of
love
this
is
my
prayer
the
confidence
that
belongs
to
life
in
death
to
victory
in
defeat
to
the
power
hidden
in
frailest
beauty
to
that
dignity
in
pain
which
accepts
hurt
but
disdains
to
return
it
translations
from
hindi
songs
of
jnanadas
where
were
your
songs
my
bird
when
you
spent
your
nights
in
the
nest
was
not
all
your
pleasure
stored
therein
what
makes
you
lose
your
heart
to
the
sky
the
sky
that
is
boundless
while
i
rested
within
bounds
i
was
content
but
when
i
soared
into
vastness
i
found
i
could
sing
messenger
morning
brought
you
habited
in
gold
after
sunset
your
song
wore
a
tune
of
ascetic
grey
and
then
came
night
your
message
was
written
in
bright
letters
across
black
why
is
such
splendour
about
you
to
lure
the
heart
of
one
who
is
nothing
great
is
the
festival
hall
where
you
are
to
be
the
only
guest
therefore
the
letter
to
you
is
written
from
sky
to
sky
and
i
the
proud
servant
bring
the
invitation
with
all
ceremony
i
had
travelled
all
day
and
was
tired
then
i
bowed
my
head
towards
thy
kingly
court
still
far
away
the
night
deepened
a
longing
burned
in
my
heart
whatever
the
words
i
sang
pain
cried
through
them
for
even
my
songs
thirsted
o
my
lover
my
beloved
my
best
in
all
the
world
when
time
seemed
lost
in
darkness
thy
hand
dropped
its
sceptre
to
take
up
the
lute
and
strike
the
uttermost
chords
and
my
heart
sang
out
o
my
lover
my
beloved
my
best
in
all
the
world
ah
who
is
this
whose
arms
enfold
me
whatever
i
have
to
leave
let
me
leave
and
whatever
i
have
to
bear
let
me
bear
only
let
me
walk
with
thee
o
my
lover
my
beloved
my
best
in
all
the
world
descend
at
whiles
from
thine
audience
hall
come
down
amid
joys
and
sorrows
hide
in
all
forms
and
delights
in
love
and
in
my
heart
there
sing
thy
songs
o
my
lover
my
beloved
my
best
in
all
the
world
the
end
