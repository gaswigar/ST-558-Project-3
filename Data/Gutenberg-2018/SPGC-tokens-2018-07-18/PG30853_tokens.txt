she
cried
this
i
would
sell
to
the
suffering
poor
the
whole
contents
and
the
platter
as
well
fell
at
my
feet
her
slight
little
figure
convulsed
with
grief
and
then
there
came
a
ripping
sound
i
of
course
did
not
tell
henrietta
of
eight
beauties
i
had
kept
out
which
he
will
come
to
newport
bolivar
was
duly
impressed
with
the
extent
of
fortune
one
of
the
beneficiaries
at
palm
beach
it
was
not
always
easy
to
get
the
right
light
all
was
as
henriette
had
foretold
you
wanted
a
lake
higginbotham
i
as
keen
and
a
performance
as
i
ever
witnessed
on
her
way
to
early
church
i
waylaid
norah
henriette
was
testing
the
piano
my
misery
is
deep
but
i
am
buoyed
up
by
one
great
hope
raffles
i
the
adventure
of
the
personal
that
i
was
in
a
hard
case
is
best
attested
by
the
fact
that
when
i
had
paid
for
my
sunday
there
was
left
in
my
purse
just
one
stamp
and
two
copper
cents
one
dated
the
other
the
mere
incident
that
at
this
hour
eighteen
months
later
i
can
recall
the
dates
of
these
coins
should
be
proof
if
any
were
needed
of
the
importance
of
the
coppers
in
my
eyes
and
therefore
of
the
relative
scarcity
of
funds
in
my
possession
raffles
was
dead
killed
as
you
may
remember
at
the
battle
of
spion
kop
and
i
his
companion
who
had
never
known
want
while
his
deft
fingers
were
able
to
carry
out
the
plans
of
that
insinuating
and
marvellous
mind
of
his
was
now
in
the
vernacular
of
the
american
up
against
it
i
had
come
to
the
united
states
not
because
i
had
any
liking
for
that
country
or
its
people
who
to
tell
the
truth
are
too
sharp
for
an
ordinary
burglar
like
myself
but
because
with
the
war
at
an
end
i
had
to
go
somewhere
and
english
soil
was
not
safely
to
be
trod
by
one
who
was
required
for
professional
reasons
to
evade
the
eagle
eye
of
scotland
yard
until
the
statute
of
limitations
began
to
have
some
bearing
upon
his
case
that
last
affair
of
raffles
and
mine
wherein
we
had
successfully
got
away
with
the
diamond
stomacher
of
the
duchess
of
herringdale
was
still
a
live
matter
in
british
detective
circles
and
the
very
audacity
of
the
crime
had
definitely
fastened
the
responsibility
for
it
upon
our
shoulders
hence
it
was
america
for
me
where
one
could
be
as
english
as
one
pleased
without
being
subject
to
the
laws
of
his
majesty
king
edward
of
great
britain
and
ireland
and
sundry
other
possessions
upon
which
the
sun
rarely
if
ever
sets
for
two
years
i
had
led
a
precarious
existence
not
finding
in
the
land
of
silk
and
money
quite
as
many
of
those
opportunities
to
add
to
the
sum
of
my
prosperity
as
the
american
war
correspondent
i
had
met
in
the
transvaal
led
me
to
expect
indeed
after
six
months
of
successful
lecturing
on
the
subject
of
the
boers
before
various
lyceums
in
the
country
i
was
reduced
to
a
state
of
penury
which
actually
drove
me
to
thievery
of
the
pettiest
and
most
vulgar
sort
there
was
little
in
the
way
of
mean
theft
that
i
did
not
commit
during
the
coal
famine
for
instance
every
day
passing
the
to
and
fro
i
would
appropriate
a
single
piece
of
the
precious
anthracite
until
i
had
come
into
possession
of
a
scuttleful
and
this
i
would
sell
to
the
suffering
poor
at
prices
varying
from
three
shillings
to
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
precarious
living
indeed
the
only
respite
i
received
for
six
months
was
in
the
rape
of
the
which
i
successfully
carried
through
one
bitter
cold
night
in
january
i
hired
the
vehicle
at
madison
square
and
drove
to
a
small
tavern
on
the
boston
post
road
where
the
icy
cold
of
the
day
gave
me
an
excuse
for
getting
my
cabby
drunk
in
the
guise
of
kindness
him
safely
disposed
of
in
a
drunken
stupor
i
drove
his
jaded
steed
back
to
town
earned
fifteen
dollars
with
him
before
daybreak
and
then
leaving
the
cab
in
the
central
park
sold
the
horse
for
eighteen
dollars
to
a
contractor
over
on
the
east
side
it
was
humiliating
to
me
a
gentleman
born
and
a
partner
of
so
illustrious
a
person
as
the
late
raffles
to
have
to
stoop
to
such
miserable
doings
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
but
i
was
forced
to
confess
that
whatever
raffles
had
left
to
me
in
the
way
of
example
i
was
not
his
equal
either
in
the
conception
of
crime
or
in
the
nerve
to
carry
a
great
enterprise
through
my
biggest
coups
had
a
way
of
failing
at
their
very
beginning
which
was
about
the
only
blessing
i
enjoyed
since
none
of
them
progressed
far
enough
to
imperil
my
freedom
and
lacking
confederates
i
was
of
course
unable
to
carry
through
the
profitable
series
of
abductions
in
the
world
of
high
finance
that
i
had
contemplated
hence
my
misfortunes
and
now
on
this
beautiful
sunday
morning
penniless
but
for
the
coppers
and
the
with
no
breakfast
in
sight
and
fortunately
enough
not
even
an
appetite
i
turned
to
my
morning
paper
for
my
solace
illustration
this
i
would
sell
to
the
suffering
poor
running
my
eye
up
and
down
the
personal
column
which
has
for
years
been
my
favorite
reading
of
sunday
mornings
i
found
the
usual
assortment
of
matrimonial
enterprises
recorded
pathetic
appeals
from
to
meet
on
the
corner
of
street
at
three
imploring
requests
from
j
to
return
at
once
to
his
only
mother
who
promises
to
ask
no
questions
and
finally
could
i
believe
my
eyes
now
riveted
upon
the
word
my
own
sobriquet
printed
as
boldly
and
as
plainly
as
though
i
were
some
patent
cure
for
all
known
human
ailments
it
seemed
incredible
but
there
it
was
beyond
all
peradventure
a
butler
bunny
preferred
apply
to
j
van
raffles
bolivar
lodge
newport
to
whom
could
that
refer
if
not
to
myself
and
what
could
it
mean
who
was
this
j
van
raffles
a
name
so
like
that
of
my
dead
friend
that
it
seemed
almost
identical
my
curiosity
was
roused
to
concert
pitch
if
this
strange
advertiser
should
be
but
no
she
would
not
send
for
me
after
that
stormy
interview
in
which
she
cast
me
over
to
take
the
hand
of
raffles
the
brilliant
fascinating
raffles
who
would
have
won
his
isabella
from
ferdinand
chloe
from
her
corydon
pierrette
from
pierrot
ay
even
heloise
from
abelard
i
never
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
blame
henriette
for
losing
her
heart
to
him
even
though
she
had
already
promised
it
to
me
for
i
myself
could
not
resist
the
fascination
of
the
man
at
whose
side
i
faithfully
worked
even
after
he
had
stolen
from
me
this
dearest
treasure
of
my
heart
and
yet
who
else
could
it
be
if
not
the
lovely
henriette
surely
the
combination
of
raffles
with
or
without
the
van
and
bunny
was
not
so
usual
as
to
permit
of
so
remarkable
a
coincidence
i
will
go
to
newport
at
once
i
cried
rising
and
pacing
the
floor
excitedly
for
i
had
many
times
in
cursing
my
loneliness
dreamed
of
henriette
and
had
oftener
and
oftener
of
late
found
myself
wondering
what
had
become
of
her
and
then
the
helplessness
of
my
position
burst
upon
me
with
full
force
how
should
i
the
penniless
wanderer
in
new
york
get
to
bolivar
lodge
at
newport
it
takes
money
in
this
sordid
country
to
get
about
even
as
it
does
in
britain
in
sorry
truth
things
in
detail
differ
little
whether
one
lives
under
a
king
or
a
president
poverty
is
quite
as
hard
to
bear
and
free
passes
on
the
railroad
are
just
as
scarce
curses
on
these
plutocrats
i
muttered
as
i
thought
of
the
railway
directors
rolling
in
wealth
running
trains
filled
with
empty
seats
to
and
from
the
spot
that
might
contain
my
fortune
and
i
unable
to
avail
myself
of
them
for
the
lack
of
a
paltry
dollar
or
two
but
suddenly
the
thought
flashed
over
me
telegraph
collect
if
it
is
she
she
will
respond
at
once
and
so
it
was
that
an
hour
later
the
following
message
was
ticked
over
the
wires
personal
received
telegraph
railway
fare
and
i
will
go
to
you
instantly
signed
bunny
for
three
mortal
hours
i
paced
the
streets
feverishly
awaiting
the
reply
and
at
it
came
disconcerting
enough
in
all
conscience
if
you
are
not
a
bogus
bunny
you
will
know
how
to
raise
the
cash
if
you
are
a
bogus
bunny
i
do
want
you
it
was
simple
direct
and
convincing
and
my
heart
fluttered
like
the
morning
call
to
action
the
moment
i
read
it
by
jove
i
cried
the
woman
is
right
of
course
it
must
be
henriette
and
i
go
to
her
if
i
have
to
rob
a
machine
it
was
as
of
old
i
always
was
until
some
one
gave
me
a
bit
of
encouragement
a
word
of
praise
or
cheer
from
raffles
in
the
old
days
and
i
was
ready
to
batter
down
gibraltar
a
bit
of
discouragement
and
a
rag
was
beside
me
you
are
not
a
bogus
bunny
you
will
know
i
read
spreading
the
message
out
before
me
that
is
to
say
believes
that
if
i
am
really
myself
i
can
surmount
the
insurmountable
gad
i
do
it
and
i
set
off
up
fifth
avenue
hoping
to
discover
or
by
cogitation
in
the
balmy
air
of
the
afternoon
to
conceive
of
some
plan
to
relieve
my
necessities
but
somehow
or
other
it
would
come
there
were
no
pockets
about
to
be
picked
in
the
ordinary
way
i
the
fare
for
a
ride
on
the
surface
or
elevated
cars
where
i
might
have
found
an
opportunity
to
relieve
some
traveller
of
his
purse
and
as
for
snatching
such
a
thing
from
some
shopper
it
was
sunday
and
the
women
who
would
have
been
an
easy
prey
on
a
carried
neither
purse
nor
with
them
i
was
in
despair
and
then
the
pealing
bells
of
jondy
the
spiritual
home
of
the
of
new
york
rang
out
the
call
to
afternoon
service
it
was
like
an
invitation
the
way
was
clear
my
plan
was
laid
in
an
instant
and
it
worked
beyond
my
most
hopeful
anticipations
entering
the
church
i
was
ushered
to
a
pew
about
halfway
up
the
centre
aisle
despite
my
poverty
i
had
managed
to
keep
myself
always
and
no
one
would
have
guessed
to
look
at
my
faultless
and
neatly
creased
trousers
at
my
finely
gloved
hand
and
polished
that
my
pockets
held
scarcely
a
brass
farthing
the
service
proceeded
a
good
sermon
on
the
vanity
of
riches
found
lodgment
in
my
ears
and
then
the
supreme
moment
came
the
was
passed
and
gripping
my
two
pennies
in
my
hand
i
made
as
if
to
place
them
in
the
salver
but
with
studied
awkwardness
i
knocked
the
from
the
hands
of
the
gentleman
who
passed
it
the
whole
contents
and
the
platter
as
well
fell
at
my
feet
and
from
my
lips
in
reverent
whispers
poured
forth
no
end
of
most
abject
apologies
of
course
i
assisted
in
recovering
the
fallen
bills
and
coins
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
vestryman
was
proceeding
on
his
way
up
the
aisle
gathering
in
the
contributions
from
other
generously
disposed
persons
as
he
went
as
unconsciously
as
though
the
had
never
occurred
and
happily
unaware
that
out
of
the
moneys
cast
to
the
floor
by
my
awkward
act
two
bills
five
and
a
dime
remained
behind
under
the
hassock
at
my
feet
whither
i
had
managed
to
push
them
with
my
toe
while
offering
my
apologies
illustration
the
whole
contents
and
the
platter
as
well
fell
at
my
feet
an
hour
later
having
dined
heartily
at
delsherrico
i
was
comfortably
napping
in
a
pullman
car
on
my
way
to
the
social
capital
of
the
united
states
ii
the
adventure
of
the
newport
villa
there
is
little
need
for
me
to
describe
in
detail
the
story
of
my
railway
journey
from
new
york
to
newport
it
was
uneventful
and
unproductive
save
as
to
the
latter
end
of
it
when
on
the
arrival
of
the
train
at
wickford
observing
that
the
gentleman
bound
for
boston
who
occupied
the
seat
next
mine
in
the
pullman
car
was
sleeping
soundly
i
exchanged
my
covert
coat
for
his
richly
made
surtout
and
made
off
as
well
with
his
on
the
chance
of
its
holding
something
that
might
later
serve
some
one
of
my
many
purposes
i
mention
this
in
passing
only
because
the
containing
as
it
did
all
the
essential
features
of
a
gentleman
evening
attire
even
to
three
superb
pearl
studs
in
the
bosom
of
an
immaculately
white
shirt
all
of
them
marvellously
enough
as
perfectly
fitting
as
though
they
had
been
made
for
me
with
a
hundred
unregistered
bonds
of
the
united
states
steel
company
of
which
securities
there
will
be
more
anon
enabled
me
later
to
appear
before
van
raffles
in
a
guise
so
prosperous
as
to
win
an
immediate
renewal
of
her
favor
we
shall
be
almost
as
great
a
combination
as
the
original
bunny
she
cried
enthusiastically
when
i
told
her
of
this
coup
with
my
brains
and
your
blind
luck
nothing
can
stop
us
my
own
feelings
as
i
drove
up
to
bolivar
lodge
were
mixed
i
still
loved
henriette
madly
but
the
contrast
between
her
present
luxury
and
my
recent
misery
grated
harshly
upon
me
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
notion
that
raffles
had
told
her
of
the
secret
of
the
diamond
stomacher
of
the
duchess
of
herringdale
and
that
she
had
appropriated
to
her
own
use
all
the
proceeds
of
its
sale
leaving
me
who
had
risked
my
liberty
to
obtain
it
without
a
penny
worth
of
dividend
for
my
pains
it
did
not
seem
quite
a
level
thing
to
do
and
i
must
confess
that
i
greeted
the
lady
in
a
reproachful
spirit
it
was
indeed
she
and
more
radiantly
beautiful
than
ever
a
trifle
thinner
perhaps
and
her
eyes
more
coldly
piercing
than
seductively
winning
as
of
yore
but
still
henriette
whom
i
had
once
so
madly
loved
and
who
had
jilted
me
for
a
better
man
dear
old
bunny
she
murmured
holding
out
both
hands
in
welcome
just
to
think
that
after
all
these
years
and
in
a
strange
land
and
under
such
circumstances
we
should
meet
again
it
is
strange
said
i
my
eye
roving
about
the
which
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
appointments
and
decoration
was
about
the
richest
thing
i
had
ever
seen
either
by
light
of
day
or
in
the
mysterious
glimpses
one
gets
with
a
dark
lantern
of
the
houses
of
the
moneyed
classes
it
seems
more
than
strange
i
added
significantly
to
see
you
surrounded
by
such
luxury
a
lodge
built
of
the
finest
grade
of
italian
marble
gardens
fit
for
the
palace
of
a
king
a
retinue
of
servants
such
as
one
scarcely
finds
on
the
ducal
estates
of
the
proudest
families
of
england
and
a
mansion
that
is
furnished
with
treasures
of
art
any
one
of
which
is
worth
a
queen
ransom
i
do
not
wonder
you
are
surprised
she
replied
looking
about
the
room
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
that
did
little
to
soothe
my
growing
wrath
it
certainly
leaves
room
for
explanation
i
retorted
coldly
of
course
if
raffles
told
you
where
the
herringdale
jewels
were
hid
and
you
have
disposed
of
them
some
of
all
this
could
be
accounted
for
but
what
of
me
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
i
was
entitled
to
some
part
of
the
swag
oh
you
poor
suspicious
old
bunny
she
rippled
have
i
sent
for
you
to
give
you
some
share
of
this
although
truly
you
do
deserve
it
for
is
all
mine
i
have
any
more
notion
what
became
of
the
herringdale
jewels
than
the
duchess
of
herringdale
herself
what
i
cried
then
these
surroundings
are
she
said
with
a
merry
little
laugh
and
all
through
a
plan
of
my
own
bunny
this
house
as
you
may
not
be
aware
is
the
late
residence
of
and
mrs
constant
scrappe
who
are
suing
each
other
for
divorce
i
put
in
for
i
knew
of
the
constant
scrappes
in
social
life
as
who
did
not
since
a
good
third
of
the
society
items
of
the
day
concerned
themselves
with
the
matrimonial
difficulties
of
this
notable
couple
precisely
said
henriette
now
scrappe
is
in
south
dakota
establishing
a
residence
and
colonel
scrappe
is
at
monte
carlo
circulating
his
money
with
the
aid
of
a
wheel
and
a
small
ball
bolivar
lodge
with
its
fine
collection
of
old
furniture
its
splendid
jades
its
marvellous
oriental
potteries
paintings
and
innumerable
small
silver
articles
is
left
here
at
newport
and
for
rent
what
more
natural
dear
than
that
i
needing
a
residence
whose
occupancy
would
in
itself
be
an
assurance
of
my
social
position
should
snap
it
up
with
an
eagerness
which
in
this
newport
atmosphere
amounted
nearly
to
a
betrayal
of
plebeian
origin
but
it
must
cost
a
fortune
i
cried
gazing
about
me
at
the
splendors
of
the
room
which
even
to
a
cursory
inspection
revealed
themselves
as
of
priceless
value
that
cloisonné
jar
over
by
the
fireplace
is
worth
two
hundred
pounds
alone
that
is
just
the
reason
why
i
wanted
this
particular
house
bunny
it
is
also
why
i
need
your
assistance
in
maintaining
it
raffles
returned
woman
is
ever
a
mystery
i
responded
with
a
harsh
laugh
why
in
heaven
name
you
think
i
can
help
you
to
pay
your
rent
it
is
only
hundred
dollars
a
month
bunny
she
said
my
answer
was
a
roar
of
derisive
laughter
hear
her
i
cried
addressing
the
empty
air
only
hundred
dollars
a
month
why
my
dear
henriette
if
it
were
hundred
a
century
i
could
help
you
pay
a
day
rental
i
am
that
strapped
until
this
afternoon
i
had
seen
thirty
cents
all
at
once
for
nigh
on
to
six
months
i
have
been
so
poor
that
i
had
to
take
my
morning
coffee
at
midnight
from
the
of
the
new
york
boston
and
chicago
sporting
papers
in
eight
months
i
have
not
tasted
a
dinner
that
an
expert
would
value
at
fifteen
cents
net
and
yet
you
ask
me
to
help
you
pay
hundred
dollars
a
month
rent
for
a
newport
palace
you
must
be
mad
you
are
the
same
loquacious
old
bunny
that
you
used
to
be
said
raffles
sharply
yet
with
a
touch
of
affection
in
her
voice
you
keep
your
trap
shut
for
a
second
can
you
do
you
know
bunny
what
dear
old
said
to
me
just
before
he
went
to
south
africa
it
was
that
if
you
were
as
devoted
to
business
as
you
were
to
words
you
be
a
wonder
his
exact
remark
was
that
we
would
both
have
to
look
out
for
you
for
fear
you
would
queer
the
whole
business
raffles
estimated
that
your
habit
of
full
accounts
of
his
various
burglaries
for
the
london
magazines
had
made
the
risks
one
hundred
per
cent
bigger
and
the
available
swag
a
thousand
per
cent
harder
to
get
hold
of
said
he
the
night
before
he
sailed
i
die
over
in
the
transvaal
and
you
decide
to
continue
the
business
get
along
as
long
as
you
can
without
a
if
you
go
on
the
stage
surround
yourself
with
but
in
the
burglary
trade
they
are
a
nuisance
my
answer
was
a
sulky
shrug
of
the
shoulders
you
have
given
me
a
chance
to
explain
how
you
are
to
help
me
i
do
ask
you
for
money
bunny
four
dollars
worth
of
obedience
is
all
i
want
she
continued
the
portable
property
in
this
mansion
is
worth
about
half
a
million
dollars
my
lad
and
i
want
you
to
be
well
my
official
porter
i
took
immediate
possession
of
this
house
and
my
first
month
rent
was
paid
with
the
proceeds
of
a
sale
of
three
old
bedsteads
i
found
on
the
top
floor
six
pieces
of
sèvres
china
from
the
southeast
bedroom
on
the
floor
above
this
and
a
satsuma
vase
which
i
discovered
in
a
on
the
third
floor
a
light
began
to
dawn
on
me
before
coming
here
i
eked
out
a
miserable
existence
in
new
york
as
buyer
for
an
antique
dealer
on
fourth
avenue
she
explained
he
thinks
i
am
still
working
for
him
travelling
about
the
country
in
search
of
bargains
in
mahogany
desks
antique
tables
wardrobes
bedsteads
in
short
valuable
junk
generally
now
do
you
see
as
raffles
or
van
raffles
as
you
have
it
now
i
demanded
oh
bunny
bunny
bunny
what
a
stupid
you
are
never
as
miss
she
replied
from
this
i
earn
fifteen
dollars
a
week
the
sources
of
the
material
i
send
him
well
do
you
see
now
bunny
it
is
growing
clearer
said
i
you
contemplate
paying
the
rent
of
this
house
with
its
contents
is
that
it
what
beautiful
intelligence
you
have
bunny
she
laughed
airily
you
know
a
hawk
from
a
nobody
can
pass
a
off
on
you
for
a
horse
can
they
bunny
dear
not
while
you
have
that
eagle
eye
of
yours
wide
open
yes
sir
that
is
the
scheme

going
to
pay
the
rental
of
this
mansion
with
its
half
a
million
dollars
worth
of
contents
means
how
long
at
hundred
dollars
a
month
eh
gad
henriette
i
cried
you
are
worthy
of
raffles
i
swear
it
you
can
be
easy
about
your
rent
for
sixteen
years
that
is
about
the
size
of
it
as
these
newport
people
have
it
said
raffles
beaming
upon
me
i
still
in
the
dark
as
to
where
i
come
in
said
i
promise
to
obey
my
directions
implicitly
said
henriette
and
you
will
receive
your
share
of
the
booty
henriette
i
cried
passionately
seizing
her
hand
no
bunny
not
now
she
remonstrated
gently
this
is
no
time
for
sentiment
just
promise
to
obey
the
love
and
honor
business
may
come
later
i
will
said
i
well
then
she
resumed
her
color
mounting
high
and
speaking
rapidly
you
are
to
return
at
once
to
new
york
taking
with
you
three
trunks
which
i
have
already
packed
containing
one
of
the
most
beautiful
collections
of
jade
ornaments
that
has
ever
been
gathered
together
you
will
rent
a
furnished
apartment
in
some
aristocratic
quarter
spread
these
articles
throughout
your
rooms
as
though
you
were
a
connoisseur
and
on
thursday
next
when
harold
van
gilt
calls
upon
you
to
see
your
collection
you
will
sell
it
to
him
for
not
less
than
eight
thousand
dollars
aha
said
i
i
see
the
scheme
this
you
will
immediately
remit
to
me
here
she
continued
excitedly
van
gilt
will
pay
cash
i
laughed
why
eight
thousand
i
demanded
are
you
living
beyond
your
ah
income
no
she
answered
but
next
month
rent
is
due
tuesday
and
i
owe
my
servants
and
tradesmen
hundred
dollars
more
even
then
there
will
be
three
thousand
dollars
over
i
put
in
true
bunny
true
but
i
shall
need
it
all
dear
i
am
invited
to
the
gasters
on
sunday
afternoon
to
play
bridge
henriette
explained
we
must
prepare
for
emergencies
i
returned
to
new
york
on
the
boat
that
night
and
by
wednesday
was
safely
ensconced
in
very
beautifully
furnished
bachelor
quarters
near
gramercy
square
where
on
thursday
harold
van
gilt
called
to
see
my
collection
of
jades
which
i
was
selling
because
of
a
contemplated
journey
into
the
east
on
friday
van
gilt
took
possession
of
the
collection
and
that
night
a
check
for
eight
thousand
dollars
went
to
van
raffles
at
newport
incidentally
i
passed
two
thousand
dollars
to
my
own
credit
as
i
figured
it
out
if
van
gilt
was
willing
to
pay
ten
thousand
dollars
for
the
stuff
and
henriette
was
willing
to
take
eight
thousand
dollars
for
it
nobody
was
the
loser
by
my
pocketing
two
thousand
dollars
unless
perhaps
it
was
and
mrs
constant
scrappe
who
owned
the
goods
but
that
was
none
of
my
affair
i
played
straight
with
the
others
and
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
iii
the
adventure
of
gaster
maid
two
days
after
my
bargain
with
harold
van
gilt
in
which
he
acquired
possession
of
the
scrappe
jades
and
van
raffles
and
i
shared
the
proceeds
of
the
ten
thousand
dollars
check
i
was
installed
at
bolivar
lodge
as
and
steward
my
salary
to
consist
of
what
i
could
make
out
of
it
on
the
side
plus
ten
per
cent
of
the
winnings
of
my
mistress
it
was
not
long
before
i
discovered
that
the
job
was
a
lucrative
one
from
various
tradesmen
of
the
town
i
received
presents
of
no
little
value
in
the
form
sometimes
of
diamond
gold
link
cases
of
fine
wines
for
my
own
use
and
in
one
or
two
instances
checks
of
substantial
value
there
was
also
what
was
called
a
steward
rebate
on
the
monthly
bills
which
in
circles
where
lavish
entertainment
is
the
order
of
the
day
amounted
to
a
tidy
little
income
in
itself
my
only
embarrassment
lay
in
the
contact
into
which
i
was
necessarily
brought
with
other
butlers
with
whom
i
was
perforce
required
to
associate
this
went
very
much
against
the
grain
at
first
for
although
i
am
scarcely
more
than
a
thief
after
all
i
am
an
artistic
one
and
still
retain
the
prejudice
against
inferior
associations
which
an
english
gentleman
whatever
the
vicissitudes
of
his
career
can
never
quite
rid
himself
of
i
had
to
join
their
club
an
exclusive
organization
of
butlers
and
gentlemen
gentlemen
otherwise
valets
and
in
order
to
quiet
all
suspicion
of
my
real
status
in
the
van
raffles
household
i
was
compelled
to
act
the
part
in
a
fashion
which
revolted
me
otherwise
the
position
was
pleasant
and
as
i
have
intimated
more
than
lucrative
it
did
not
take
me
many
days
to
discover
that
henriette
was
a
worthy
successor
to
her
late
husband
few
opportunities
for
personal
profit
escaped
her
eye
and
i
was
able
to
observe
as
time
went
on
and
i
noted
the
accumulation
of
spoons
forks
nutcrackers
and
gimcracks
generally
that
she
brought
home
with
her
after
her
calls
upon
or
dinners
with
ladies
of
fashion
that
she
had
that
quality
of
true
genius
which
never
overlooks
the
smallest
details
the
first
big
coup
after
my
arrival
as
the
result
of
her
genius
was
in
the
affair
of
gaster
maid
henriette
had
been
to
a
bridge
afternoon
at
gaster
and
upon
her
return
manifested
an
extraordinary
degree
of
excitement
her
color
was
high
and
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
tremulous
her
disturbed
condition
was
so
evident
that
my
heart
sank
into
my
boots
for
in
our
business
nerve
is
a
qua
of
success
and
it
looked
to
me
as
if
henriette
was
losing
hers
she
has
probably
lost
at
cards
i
thought
and
it
has
affected
her
usual
calmness
i
must
do
something
to
warn
her
against
this
momentary
weakness
with
this
idea
in
mind
when
the
opportunity
presented
itself
later
i
spoke
you
lost
at
bridge
henriette
i
said
yes
she
replied
hundred
dollars
in
two
hours
how
did
you
guess
by
your
manner
said
i
you
are
as
nervous
as
a
young
girl
at
a
commencement
celebration
this
wo
do
henriette
nerves
will
prove
your
ruin
and
if
you
ca
stand
your
losses
at
bridge
what
will
you
do
in
the
face
of
the
greater
crisis
which
in
our
profession
is
likely
to
confront
us
in
the
shape
of
an
unexpected
visit
of
police
at
any
moment
her
answer
was
a
ringing
laugh
you
absurd
old
rabbit
she
murmured
as
if
i
cared
about
my
losses
at
bridge
why
my
dear
bunny
i
lost
that
money
on
purpose
you
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
risk
my
popularity
with
these
newport
ladies
by
winning
do
you
not
i
my
boy
i
plan
too
far
ahead
for
that
for
the
good
of
our
cause
it
is
my
task
to
lose
steadily
and
with
good
grace
this
establishes
my
credit
proves
my
amiability
and
confirms
my
popularity
but
you
are
very
much
excited
by
something
henriette
said
i
you
can
not
deny
that
i
do
but
it
is
the
prospect
of
future
gain
not
the
reality
of
present
losses
that
has
taken
me
off
my
poise
she
said
whom
do
you
suppose
i
saw
at
gaster
no
detectives
i
hope
i
replied
paling
at
the
thought
no
sir
she
laughed
gaster
maid
we
must
get
her
bunny
oh
tush
i
ejaculated
all
this
powwow
over
another
woman
maid
you
do
understand
said
henriette
it
was
the
maid
so
much
as
the
woman
that
startled
me
bunny
you
ca
guess
who
she
was
how
should
i
i
demanded
she
was
fiametta
de
belleville
one
of
the
most
expert
hands
in
our
business
poor
old
raffles
used
to
say
that
she
diminished
his
income
a
good
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
by
getting
in
her
fine
work
ahead
of
his
explained
henriette
he
pointed
her
out
to
me
in
piccadilly
once
and
i
have
never
forgotten
her
face
i
hope
she
did
not
recognize
you
i
observed
no
indeed
she
never
saw
me
before
so
how
could
she
but
i
knew
her
the
minute
she
took
my
cloak
said
henriette
she
dyed
her
hair
but
her
eyes
were
the
same
as
ever
and
that
peculiar
twist
of
the
lip
that
raffles
had
spoken
of
as
constituting
one
of
her
fascinations
remained
unchanged
moreover
just
to
prove
myself
right
i
left
my
lace
handkerchief
and
a
five
hundred
dollar
bill
in
the
cloak
pocket
when
i
got
the
cloak
back
both
were
gone
oh
she
fiametta
de
belleville
all
right
and
we
must
get
her
what
for
to
rob
you
no
returned
henrietta
rather
that
we
but
there
there
bunny
manage
this
little
thing
myself
it
a
trifle
too
subtle
for
a
intellect
especially
when
that
man
is
you
what
do
you
suppose
she
is
doing
here
i
asked
you
silly
boy
laughed
henriette
doing
why
gaster
of
course
she
is
after
the
gaster
jewels
humph
i
said
gloomily
that
cuts
us
out
does
it
does
it
asked
henriette
enigmatically
it
was
about
ten
weeks
later
that
the
newspapers
of
the
whole
country
were
ringing
with
the
startling
news
of
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
gaster
jewels
the
lady
had
been
robbed
of
three
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
worth
of
gems
and
there
was
apparently
no
clew
even
to
the
thief
henriette
and
i
of
course
knew
that
fiametta
de
belleville
had
accomplished
her
mission
but
apparently
no
one
else
knew
it
true
she
had
been
accused
and
had
been
subjected
to
a
most
rigid
examination
by
the
newport
police
and
the
new
york
central
office
but
no
proof
of
any
kind
establishing
her
guilt
could
be
adduced
and
after
a
week
of
suspicion
she
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
relieved
of
all
odium
she
skip
now
said
i
not
she
said
henriette
to
disappear
now
would
be
a
confession
of
guilt
if
fiametta
de
belleville
is
the
woman
i
take
her
for
she
stay
right
here
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
of
course
not
at
mrs
gaster
where
then
i
asked
with
j
van
raffles
replied
henriette
the
fact
is
she
added
i
have
already
engaged
her
she
has
acted
her
part
well
and
has
seemed
so
prostrated
by
the
unjust
suspicion
of
the
world
that
even
gaster
is
disturbed
over
her
condition
she
has
asked
her
to
remain
but
fiametta
has
refused
could
madam
she
said
when
gaster
asked
her
to
stay
have
accused
me
of
a
fearful
crime
a
crime
of
which
i
am
innocent
and
i
rather
work
in
a
factory
or
become
a
in
a
department
store
than
stay
longer
in
a
house
where
such
painful
things
have
happened
result
next
tuesday
fiametta
de
belleville
comes
to
me
as
maid
well
henriette
said
i
i
presume
you
know
your
own
business
but
why
you
lay
yourself
open
to
being
robbed
yourself
and
to
having
the
profits
of
your
own
business
diminished
i
ca
see
please
remember
that
i
warned
you
against
this
foolish
act
all
right
bunny
i
remember
smiled
van
raffles
and
there
the
matter
was
dropped
for
the
moment
the
following
tuesday
fiametta
de
belleville
was
installed
in
the
van
raffles
household
as
the
maid
of
j
van
raffles
to
her
eagle
eye
it
was
another
promising
field
for
profit
for
henriette
had
spared
neither
pains
nor
money
to
impress
fiametta
with
the
idea
that
next
to
gaster
she
was
about
as
lavish
and
financially
capable
a
householder
as
could
be
found
in
the
social
capital
of
the
united
states
as
for
me
i
was
the
picture
of
gloom
the
woman
presence
in
our
household
could
not
be
but
a
source
of
danger
to
our
peace
of
mind
as
well
as
to
our
profits
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
see
why
henriette
should
want
her
there
but
i
was
not
long
in
finding
out
a
week
after
fiametta
arrival
raffles
rang
hurriedly
for
me
yes
madam
i
said
responding
immediately
to
her
call
bunny
she
said
her
hand
trembling
a
little
the
hour
for
action
has
arrived
i
have
just
sent
fiametta
on
an
errand
to
providence
she
will
be
gone
three
hours
yes
said
i
what
of
it
i
want
you
during
her
absence
to
go
with
me
to
her
room
the
situation
began
to
dawn
on
me
yes
i
cried
breathlessly
and
search
her
trunks
no
bunny
no
the
eaves
whispered
henriette
i
gave
her
that
room
in
the
wing
because
it
has
so
many
odd
where
she
could
conceal
things
i
am
inclined
to
think
well
the
moment
she
leaves
the
city
let
me
know
follow
her
to
the
station
and
do
return
till
you
know
she
is
safely
out
of
town
and
on
her
way
to
providence
then
turn
will
come
oh
that
woman
if
i
had
not
adored
her
before
i
but
enough
this
is
no
place
for
sentiment
the
story
is
the
thing
and
i
must
tell
it
briefly
i
followed
out
henriette
instructions
to
the
letter
and
an
hour
later
returned
with
the
information
that
fiametta
was
indeed
safely
on
her
way
good
said
raffles
and
now
bunny
for
the
gaster
jewels
mounting
the
stairs
rapidly
taking
care
of
course
that
there
were
none
of
the
other
servants
about
to
spy
upon
us
we
came
to
the
room
everything
in
it
betokened
a
high
mind
and
a
good
character
there
were
religious
pictures
upon
the
bureau
and
some
volumes
of
essays
of
a
spiritual
nature
were
scattered
about
nothing
was
there
to
indicate
that
the
occupant
was
anything
but
a
simple
sweet
child
of
innocence
except
well
henriette
was
right
except
the
gaster
jewels
even
as
my
mistress
had
suspected
they
were
cached
under
the
eaves
snuggled
close
against
the
huge
looking
out
upon
the
gardens
laid
by
for
a
convenient
moment
to
get
them
out
of
newport
and
then
back
to
england
for
fiametta
and
what
a
gorgeous
collection
they
were
of
diamonds
yards
of
pearl
rope
necklaces
of
rubies
of
the
most
lustrous
color
and
of
the
size
of
pigeons
eggs
rings
brooches
tiaras
everything
in
the
way
of
jewelled
ornament
the
soul
of
woman
could
desire
all
packed
closely
away
in
a
tin
box
that
i
now
remembered
fiametta
had
brought
with
her
in
her
hand
the
day
of
her
arrival
and
now
all
these
things
were
ours
henriette
and
mine
without
our
having
had
to
stir
to
get
them
an
hour
later
they
were
in
the
vault
of
j
van
raffles
in
the
sturdy
cellars
of
the
tiverton
trust
company
as
secure
against
intrusion
as
though
they
were
locked
in
the
heart
of
gibraltar
itself
illustration
her
slight
little
figure
convulsed
with
grief
and
fiametta
well
a
week
later
she
left
newport
suddenly
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
and
her
slight
little
figure
convulsed
with
grief
her
favorite
aunt
had
just
died
she
said
and
she
was
going
back
to
england
to
bury
her
iv
the
pearl
rope
of
bunny
said
henrietta
one
morning
shortly
after
we
had
come
into
possession
of
the
gaster
jewels
how
is
your
nerve
are
you
ready
for
a
coup
requiring
a
lot
of
it
well
i
replied
pluming
myself
a
bit
i
do
wish
to
boast
henriette
but
i
think
it
is
pretty
good
i
managed
to
raise
hundred
dollars
on
my
own
account
by
the
use
of
it
last
night
indeed
said
henriette
with
a
slight
frown
how
bunny
you
know
you
are
likely
to
complicate
matters
for
all
of
us
if
you
work
on
the
side
what
pray
did
you
do
last
night
and
then
i
unfolded
to
her
the
incidents
of
the
night
before
when
by
assuming
at
a
moment
notice
the
position
of
valet
to
young
robertson
de
pelt
the
frisky
young
favorite
of
the
inner
set
i
had
relieved
that
young
bachelor
of
fifteen
hundred
dollars
in
cash
and
some
twelve
hundred
dollars
worth
of
jewels
as
well
i
was
spending
the
evening
at
the
gentlemen
gentlemen
club
i
explained
when
word
came
over
the
telephone
to
digby
de
valet
that
de
pelt
was
at
the
rockerbilts
and
in
no
condition
to
go
home
alone
it
happened
that
it
was
i
who
took
the
message
and
observing
that
digby
was
engaged
in
a
game
of
billiards
and
likely
to
remain
so
for
some
time
to
come
i
decided
to
go
after
the
gentleman
myself
without
saying
anything
to
digby
about
it
muffling
myself
up
so
that
no
one
could
recognize
me
i
hired
a
cab
and
drove
out
to
the
rockerbilt
mansion
sent
in
word
that
de
pelt
man
was
waiting
for
him
and
in
ten
minutes
had
the
young
gentleman
in
my
possession
i
took
him
to
his
apartment
dismissed
the
cab
and
letting
ourselves
into
his
room
with
his
own
put
him
to
bed
his
clothes
i
took
as
a
valet
should
from
his
into
an
adjoining
room
where
after
removing
the
contents
of
his
pockets
i
hung
them
neatly
over
a
chair
and
departed
taking
with
me
of
course
everything
of
value
the
young
gentleman
had
about
him
even
down
to
the
two
brilliant
rubies
he
wore
in
his
garter
buckles
this
consisted
of
two
handfuls
of
crumpled
bills
from
his
trousers
three
rolls
of
bills
from
his
waistcoat
and
sundry
other
lots
of
currency
both
paper
and
specie
that
i
found
stowed
away
in
his
overcoat
and
pockets
there
were
also
ten
gold
pieces
in
a
little
silver
he
carried
on
his
wrist
as
i
say
there
was
about
fifteen
hundred
dollars
of
this
loose
change
and
i
reckon
up
the
value
of
his
studs
garter
rubies
and
at
about
twelve
hundred
dollars
more
or
a
hundred
dollars
pull
in
all
eh
mercy
bunny
that
was
a
terribly
risky
thing
suppose
he
had
recognized
you
cried
henriette
oh
he
did
or
at
least
he
thought
he
did
i
replied
smiling
broadly
at
the
recollection
on
the
way
home
in
the
cab
he
wept
on
my
shoulder
and
said
i
was
the
best
friend
he
ever
had
and
told
me
he
loved
me
like
a
brother
there
was
anything
he
would
do
for
me
and
if
ever
i
wanted
an
automobile
or
a
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
ask
him
for
it
he
was
very
genial
well
bunny
said
henriette
you
are
very
clever
at
times
but
do
be
careful
i
am
delighted
to
have
you
show
your
nerve
now
and
then
but
please
do
take
any
serious
chances
if
de
pelt
ever
recognizes
you
and
he
dines
here
next
wednesday
you
get
us
both
into
awful
trouble
again
i
laughed
he
wo
said
i
with
a
conviction
born
of
experience
his
geniality
was
of
the
kind
that
leaves
the
mind
a
blank
the
following
morning
i
do
believe
de
pelt
remembers
now
that
he
was
at
the
rockerbilts
last
night
and
even
if
he
does
know
that
i
was
in
this
house
at
eleven
i
bunny
why
i
have
seen
you
since
dinner
she
demurred
nevertheless
henriette
you
know
that
i
was
in
the
house
at
eleven
last
night
or
rather
you
know
it
if
you
are
ever
questioned
on
the
subject
which
you
wo
be
said
i
so
now
that
i
have
shown
you
in
just
what
shape
my
nerve
is
what
is
the
demand
you
are
going
to
put
upon
it
you
will
have
to
bring
to
the
enterprise
all
that
ability
which
used
to
characterize
your
efforts
as
an
amateur
actor
bunny
she
replied
summon
all
your
to
your
aid
act
with
deliberation
courtesy
and
above
all
without
the
slightest
manifestation
of
nervousness
and
we
should
win
not
a
petty
little
hundred
dollars
but
as
many
thousands
you
know
mrs
yes
said
i
she
is
the
lady
who
asked
me
for
the
olives
at
your
last
dinner
precisely
observed
henriette
you
possibly
observed
also
that
wherever
she
goes
she
wears
about
yards
of
pearl
rope
upon
her
person
rope
i
laughed
i
should
call
that
rope
cable
yes
frankly
when
she
came
into
the
the
other
night
i
thought
it
was
a
she
had
on
all
pearls
bunny
of
the
finest
water
said
henriette
enthusiastically
there
is
one
of
the
thousands
that
is
worth
anywhere
from
five
hundred
to
hundred
and
i
am
to
land
a
yard
or
two
of
the
stuff
for
you
in
some
mysterious
way
i
demanded
how
is
it
to
be
by
kidnapping
the
lady
the
snatch
and
run
game
or
how
sarcasm
does
not
suit
your
complexion
bunny
retorted
henriette
your
best
method
is
to
follow
implicitly
the
directions
of
wiser
brains
you
are
a
tool
but
as
a
principal
well
well
never
mind
you
do
what
i
tell
you
and
some
of
those
pearls
will
be
ours
as
you
may
have
noticed
is
one
of
those
exceedingly
effusive
ladies
who
go
into
ecstasies
over
everything
and
everybody
she
is
what
raffles
used
to
call
a
palaverer
where
most
people
nod
she
describes
a
complete
circle
with
her
head
when
a
cold
formal
handshake
is
necessary
she
perpetrates
an
embrace
and
that
is
where
we
come
in
at
my
next
tuesday
tea
she
will
be
present
she
will
wear
her
pearls
she
be
strung
with
them
from
head
to
foot
a
wo
be
in
it
with
her
and
every
single
little
jewel
will
be
worth
a
small
fortune
you
bunny
will
be
in
the
room
to
announce
her
when
she
arrives
she
will
rush
to
my
arms
throw
her
own
about
my
neck
the
ornaments
of
my
corsage
will
catch
the
rope
at
two
or
more
points
sever
the
thread
in
several
places
pearls
will
rain
down
upon
the
floor
by
dozens
and
then
i
to
snatch
and
dive
through
the
window
eh
i
interrupted
no
bunny
you
will
behave
like
a
gentleman
that
is
all
she
responded
haughtily
or
rather
like
a
butler
with
the
instincts
of
a
gentleman
at
my
cry
of
dismay
over
the
accident
better
call
it
the
incident
i
put
in
hush
at
my
cry
of
dismay
over
the
accident
henriette
repeated
you
will
spring
forward
go
down
upon
your
knees
and
gather
up
the
jewels
by
the
handful
you
will
pour
them
back
into
hands
and
retire
now
do
you
see
h
yes
said
i
but
how
do
you
get
the
pearls
if
i
pour
them
back
into
her
hands
am
i
to
slide
some
of
them
under
the
rugs
or
flick
them
with
my
under
the
piano
or
what
nothing
of
the
sort
bunny
just
do
as
i
tell
you
only
bring
your
gloves
to
me
just
before
the
guests
arrive
that
is
all
said
henriette
instinct
will
carry
you
through
the
rest
of
it
and
then
the
conspiracy
stopped
for
the
moment
the
following
tuesday
at
five
the
second
of
van
raffles
tuesday
afternoons
began
fortune
favored
us
in
that
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
the
number
of
guests
was
large
henriette
was
charming
in
her
new
gown
specially
imported
from
paris
a
gown
of
oriental
design
with
row
upon
row
of
brilliantly
shining
ornaments
firmly
affixed
to
the
front
of
it
and
every
one
of
them
as
sharp
as
a
steel
knife
i
could
see
at
a
glance
that
even
if
so
little
as
one
of
these
fastened
its
talons
upon
the
pearl
rope
of
nothing
under
heaven
could
save
it
from
laceration
what
a
marvellous
mind
there
lay
behind
those
exquisite
childlike
eyes
of
the
wonderful
henriette
remember
bunny
calm
deliberation
your
gloves
now
were
her
last
words
to
me
count
on
me
henriette
but
i
still
do
see
i
began
hush
just
watch
me
she
replied
whereupon
this
wonderful
creature
taking
my
white
gloves
deliberately
smeared
their
palms
and
inner
sides
of
the
fingers
with
a
paste
of
her
own
making
composed
of
talcum
powder
and
liquid
honey
nothing
more
yet
more
villainously
sticky
have
i
ever
before
encountered
there
she
said
and
at
last
i
understood
an
hour
later
our
victim
arrived
and
scarce
an
inch
of
her
but
shone
like
a
hill
with
the
pearls
she
wore
i
stood
at
the
portière
and
announced
in
my
most
blasé
but
butlerian
tones
the
lady
fairly
rushed
by
me
and
in
a
moment
her
arms
were
about
henriette
neck
you
dear
sweet
thing
cried
and
you
look
so
exquisitely
charming
illustration
and
then
there
came
a
ripping
sound
and
then
there
came
a
ripping
sound
the
two
women
started
to
draw
away
from
each
other
five
of
the
crescents
catching
in
the
rope
in
the
impulsive
jerking
back
of
in
order
that
she
might
gaze
into
henrietta
eyes
cut
through
the
marvellous
cords
of
the
exquisite
jewels
there
was
a
cry
of
dismay
both
from
henriette
and
her
guest
and
the
rug
beneath
their
feet
was
simply
white
with
riches
in
a
moment
i
was
upon
my
knees
scooping
them
up
by
the
handful
oh
dear
how
very
unfortunate
cried
henriette
here
dear
she
added
holding
out
a
pair
of
teacups
let
james
pour
them
into
this
and
james
otherwise
myself
did
so
to
the
extent
of
five
teacups
full
of
them
and
then
he
discreetly
retired
well
bunny
said
henriette
breathlessly
two
hours
later
when
her
last
guest
had
gone
tell
me
quickly
what
was
the
result
these
madam
said
i
handing
her
a
small
plush
bag
into
which
i
had
poured
the
salvage
taken
from
my
sticky
palms
a
good
work
i
added
and
egad
it
was
seventeen
pearls
of
a
value
of
twelve
hundred
dollars
each
fifteen
worth
scarcely
less
than
nine
hundred
dollars
apiece
and
some
or
eight
smaller
ones
that
we
held
to
be
worth
in
the
neighborhood
of
five
hundred
dollars
each
splendid
cried
henrietta
roughly
speaking
bunny
we
pulled
in
between
forty
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
illustration
i
of
course
did
not
tell
henriette
of
eight
beauties
i
had
kept
out
about
that
said
i
with
an
inward
chuckle
for
i
of
course
did
not
tell
henriette
of
eight
beauties
i
had
kept
out
of
the
returns
for
myself
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
when
finds
out
that
they
are
gone
i
shall
provide
for
that
said
this
wonderful
woman
i
shall
throw
her
off
the
scent
by
sending
you
over
to
her
at
once
with
sixteen
of
these
assorted
i
hate
to
give
them
up
but
i
think
it
advisable
to
pay
that
much
as
a
sort
of
insurance
against
suspicion
even
then
we
be
thousand
dollars
to
the
good
and
bunny
i
want
to
congratulate
you
on
one
thing
ah
what
that
my
my
nerve
i
asked
airily
no
the
size
of
your
hands
said
henriette
the
superficial
area
of
those
palms
of
yours
has
been
worth
ten
thousand
dollars
to
us
v
the
adventure
of
the
steel
bonds
excuse
me
henriette
said
i
one
morning
after
i
had
been
in
van
raffles
employ
for
about
three
months
and
had
begun
to
calculate
as
to
my
share
of
the
profits
what
are
you
doing
with
all
this
money
we
are
gradually
accumulating
there
must
be
pretty
near
a
million
in
hand
by
this
time
eh
one
million
two
hundred
and
thousand
five
hundred
and
dollars
and
cents
replied
henriette
instantly
it
a
tidy
little
sum
almost
enough
to
retire
on
i
suggested
now
bunny
stop
that
retorted
henriette
either
stop
it
or
else
retire
yourself
i
am
not
what
they
call
a
quitter
in
this
country
and
i
do
not
propose
at
the
very
height
of
my
career
to
give
up
a
business
which
i
have
struggled
for
years
to
establish
that
is
all
very
well
henriette
said
i
but
the
pitcher
that
goes
to
the
bat
too
often
strikes
out
at
last
i
had
become
a
baseball
fiend
during
my
sojourn
in
the
states
a
million
dollars
is
a
pot
of
money
and
it
my
advice
to
you
to
get
away
with
it
as
soon
as
you
can
excuse
me
bunny
but
when
did
i
ever
employ
you
to
give
advice
demanded
henriette
it
is
quite
evident
that
you
do
understand
me
do
you
suppose
for
an
instant
that
i
am
robbing
these
people
here
in
newport
merely
for
the
vulgar
purpose
of
acquiring
money
if
you
do
you
have
a
woful
misconception
of
the
purposes
which
actuate
an
artist
you
certainly
are
an
artist
henriette
i
answered
desirous
of
placating
her
then
you
should
know
better
than
to
intimate
that
i
am
in
this
business
for
the
sordid
dollars
and
cents
there
are
to
be
got
out
of
it
pouted
my
mistress
vauxhall
bean
does
chase
the
aniseseed
bag
because
he
loves
to
shed
the
aniseseed
or
hungers
for
bags
as
an
article
of
food
he
does
it
for
the
excitement
of
the
hunt
because
he
loves
to
feel
the
movement
of
the
hunter
that
he
sits
so
well
between
his
knees
because
he
is
enamoured
of
the
baying
of
the
hounds
the
winding
of
the
horn
and
welcomes
the
element
of
personal
danger
that
enters
into
the
sport
when
he
and
his
charger
have
to
take
an
unusual
fence
or
an
extra
broad
watercourse
so
with
me
in
separating
these
people
here
from
their
money
and
their
jewels
it
is
not
the
money
and
the
jewels
that
i
care
for
so
much
as
the
delicious
risks
i
incur
in
getting
them
what
the
high
fence
is
to
the
hunter
the
barriers
separating
me
from
gaster
are
to
me
what
the
watchful
farmer
armed
with
a
for
the
protection
of
his
crops
is
to
the
master
of
the
hounds
the
police
are
to
me
the
game
of
circumventing
the
latter
and
surmounting
the
former
are
the
joy
of
my
life
and
while
my
eyes
flash
and
sparkle
with
appetite
every
time
i
see
a
necklace
or
a
tiara
or
a
roll
of
bills
in
the
course
of
my
social
duties
it
is
not
avarice
that
makes
them
glitter
but
the
call
to
action
which
they
sound
i
felt
like
saying
that
if
that
were
the
case
i
should
esteem
it
a
privilege
to
be
made
permanent
custodian
of
the
balance
in
hand
but
it
was
quite
evident
from
henriette
manner
that
she
was
in
no
mood
for
badinage
so
i
held
my
peace
to
prove
to
you
that
i
am
not
out
for
the
money
bunny
i
give
you
a
check
this
morning
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
to
pay
you
for
those
steel
bonds
you
picked
up
on
the
train
when
you
came
up
here
from
new
york
that
times
what
they
are
worth
said
henriette
is
it
a
bargain
certainly
i
replied
delighted
with
the
proposition
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
bonds
borrow
a
million
and
a
half
on
said
henriette
what
i
cried
a
million
and
a
half
on
a
hundred
thousand
security
certainly
replied
henriette
only
it
will
require
a
little
manipulation
for
the
past
six
months
i
have
been
depositing
the
moneys
i
have
received
in
seventeen
national
banks
in
ohio
each
account
being
opened
in
a
different
name
the
balances
in
each
bank
have
averaged
about
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
thanks
to
a
circular
system
of
checks
in
an
endless
chain
that
i
have
devised
naturally
the
size
of
these
accounts
has
hugely
interested
the
bank
officials
and
they
all
regard
me
as
a
most
desirable
customer
and
i
think
i
can
manage
matters
so
that
two
or
three
of
them
anyhow
will
lend
me
all
the
money
i
want
on
those
bonds
and
this
certificate
of
trust
which
i
shall
ask
you
to
sign
me
i
laughed
surely
you
are
joking
what
value
will
my
signature
have
it
will
be
good
as
gold
after
you
have
deposited
that
check
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
in
your
new
york
bank
said
henriette
i
shall
go
to
the
president
of
the
ohoolihan
national
bank
at
oshkosh
ohio
where
i
have
at
present
three
hundred
and
thousand
three
hundred
and
dollars
and
eighteen
cents
on
deposit
and
tell
him
that
the
hon
john
warrington
bunny
of
new
york
is
my
trustee
for
an
estate
of
thirteen
million
dollars
in
funds
set
apart
for
me
by
a
famous
relative
of
mine
who
is
not
proud
of
the
connection
he
will
communicate
with
you
and
ask
you
if
this
is
true
you
will
respond
by
sending
him
a
certified
copy
of
the
trust
certificate
and
refer
him
as
to
your
own
responsibility
to
the
new
york
bank
where
our
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
is
on
deposit
i
will
then
swap
checks
with
you
for
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
mine
to
you
going
into
your
new
york
account
and
yours
to
me
as
trustee
going
into
my
account
with
the
ohoolihan
national
the
new
york
bank
will
naturally
speak
well
of
your
balance
and
the
ohoolihan
people
finding
the
check
good
will
never
think
of
questioning
your
credit
this
arranged
we
will
start
in
to
wash
those
steel
bonds
up
to
the
limit
that
a
very
simple
little
plan
of
yours
henriette
said
i
and
the
first
part
of
it
will
work
easily
i
have
no
doubt
but
how
the
deuce
are
you
going
to
wash
those
bonds
up
to
fifteen
times
their
value
easiest
thing
in
the
world
bunny
laughed
henriette
there
will
be
two
million
dollars
of
the
bonds
before
i
get
through
heavens
no
counterfeiting
i
hope
i
cried
nothing
so
vulgar
said
henriette
just
a
little
management
all
and
bunny
when
you
get
a
chance
please
hire
twenty
boxes
for
me
in
as
many
different
trust
companies
here
and
in
new
york
and
do
have
too
near
together
that
all
for
the
present
three
weeks
later
having
followed
out
henriette
instructions
to
the
letter
i
received
at
my
new
york
office
a
communication
from
the
president
of
the
ohoolihan
national
bank
of
oshkosh
ohio
inquiring
as
to
the
van
raffles
trust
fund
i
replied
with
a
certified
copy
of
the
original
which
henriette
had
already
placed
in
the
president
hands
i
incidentally
referred
the
inquirer
as
to
my
own
standing
to
the
delancy
trust
company
of
new
york
the
checks
were
exchanged
by
henriette
and
myself
hers
was
on
the
national
bank
of
brookline
massachusetts
and
was
signed
by
a
fictitious
male
name
which
shows
how
carefully
she
had
covered
her
tracks
both
went
through
without
question
and
then
the
steel
bonds
came
into
play
henriette
applied
for
a
loan
of
one
million
five
hundred
thousand
dollars
offering
the
trust
certificate
for
security
the
president
of
the
ohoolihan
national
wished
to
see
some
of
her
other
securities
if
she
had
any
to
which
henriette
cordially
replied
that
if
he
would
come
to
new
york
she
would
gladly
show
them
to
him
and
intimated
that
if
the
loan
went
through
she
would
mind
paying
the
bank
a
bonus
of
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
the
accommodation
the
response
was
immediate
bolivar
would
come
on
at
once
and
he
did
illustration
which
he
will
come
to
newport
now
bunny
said
van
raffles
on
the
morning
of
his
arrival
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
put
the
one
hundred
bonds
first
in
the
vault
of
the
amalgamated
trust
company
of
west
virginia
on
wall
street
bolivar
and
i
will
go
there
and
i
will
show
them
to
him
we
will
then
depart
immediately
after
our
departure
you
will
get
the
bonds
and
take
them
to
the
vaults
of
the
and
continental
trust
company
of
new
jersey
on
broadway
you
will
go
on
foot
we
in
a
hansom
so
that
you
will
get
there
first
i
will
take
bolivar
in
and
show
him
the
bonds
again
then
you
will
take
them
to
the
vaults
of
the
riverside
coal
trust
company
of
pennsylvania
on
broad
street
where
five
minutes
later
i
will
show
them
for
the
third
time
to
bolivar
and
so
on
we
will
repeat
this
operation
eighteen
times
in
new
york
so
that
our
visitor
will
fancy
he
has
seen
one
million
eight
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
bonds
in
all
after
which
he
will
come
to
newport
where
i
will
show
them
to
him
twice
more
making
a
see
i
toppled
back
into
a
chair
in
sheer
amazement
by
jingo
but
you
are
a
wonder
i
cried
if
it
only
works
illustration
bolivar
was
duly
impressed
with
the
extent
of
henriette
fortune
it
worked
bolivar
was
duly
impressed
with
the
extent
of
fortune
in
tangible
assets
not
to
mention
her
evident
standing
in
the
community
of
her
residence
he
was
charmingly
entertained
and
never
for
an
instant
guessed
when
at
dinner
where
henriette
had
no
less
personages
than
the
rockerbilts
gaster
tommy
dare
and
various
other
social
lights
to
meet
him
that
the
butler
who
passed
him
his
soup
and
helped
him
liberally
to
wine
was
the
hon
john
warrington
bunny
trustee
well
said
henriette
as
she
gazed
delightedly
at
the
certified
check
for
one
million
four
hundred
thousand
dollars
the
amount
of
the
loan
less
the
bonus
that
was
the
best
sport
yet
even
aside
from
the
size
of
the
check
bunny
it
was
great
chasing
the
old
man
to
cover
what
do
you
think
he
said
to
me
when
he
left
the
poor
dear
old
innocent
give
it
up
what
he
said
that
i
ought
to
be
very
careful
in
my
dealings
with
men
who
might
impose
upon
my
simplicity
laughed
henriette
simplicity
i
roared
what
ever
gave
him
the
idea
that
you
were
simple
oh
i
do
know
said
henriette
demurely
i
guess
it
was
because
i
told
him
i
kept
those
bonds
in
twenty
vaults
instead
of
in
one
to
protect
myself
in
case
of
loss
by
fire
i
did
want
to
have
too
many
eggs
in
one
basket
h
said
i
what
did
he
say
to
that
henriette
laughed
long
and
loud
at
the
recollection
of
the
aged
bank
president
reply
he
squeezed
my
hand
and
answered
a
child
it
is
indeed
said
henriette
vi
the
adventure
of
the
fund
it
was
a
bright
sunny
morning
in
the
early
summer
when
henriette
gazing
out
of
the
windows
across
the
lawns
adjoining
the
rockerbilt
place
caught
sight
of
a
number
of
ragamuffins
at
play
there
who
are
those
little
tatterdemalions
bunny
she
asked
with
a
suggestion
of
a
frown
upon
her
brow
they
have
been
playing
on
the
lawns
since
seven
this
morning
and
i
lost
quite
two
sleep
because
of
their
chatter
they
are
children
from
rockerbilt
society
i
explained
for
i
too
had
been
annoyed
by
the
loud
pranks
of
the
youngsters
and
had
made
inquiries
as
to
their
identity
every
summer
digby
de
pelt
valet
tells
me
rockerbilt
gives
a
tea
for
the
benefit
of
the
fund
and
she
always
has
a
dozen
of
the
children
from
town
for
a
week
beforehand
so
as
to
get
them
in
shape
for
the
function
get
them
in
shape
for
the
function
bunny
asked
henriette
yes
one
of
the
features
of
the
tea
is
the
presence
of
the
youngsters
and
they
have
to
be
pretty
well
rehearsed
before
rockerbilt
dares
let
them
loose
among
her
guests
said
i
for
digby
had
explained
the
scheme
in
detail
to
me
you
see
their
ideas
of
fun
are
rather
primitive
and
if
they
were
suddenly
introduced
into
polite
society
without
any
previous
training
the
results
might
prove
unpleasant
ah
said
henriette
gazing
abstractedly
out
of
the
window
in
the
manner
of
one
suddenly
seized
with
an
idea
yes
i
went
on
you
see
the
street
gamin
loves
nothing
better
in
the
way
of
diversion
than
throwing
things
at
somebody
particularly
if
that
somebody
is
what
is
known
to
his
vernacular
as
a
as
between
eating
an
peach
and
throwing
it
at
the
of
a
the
ragamuffin
would
deny
even
the
cravings
of
his
stomach
for
that
tender
morsel
it
is
his
delight
too
to
heave
tin
cans
pies
anything
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
at
the
if
i
may
use
the
term
of
all
of
which
before
he
is
turned
loose
in
the
highest
social
circles
of
the
land
it
is
desirable
that
he
shall
be
cured
i
see
said
henriette
and
so
rockerbilt
has
them
here
on
a
ten
days
probation
during
which
time
they
acquire
that
degree
of
and
veneer
of
etiquette
which
alone
makes
it
possible
for
her
to
exhibit
them
at
her
tea
precisely
said
i
she
lets
them
sleep
in
the
big
of
her
stable
where
the
extra
were
kept
before
the
craze
came
in
they
receive
four
square
meals
a
day
are
rubbed
down
and
before
each
meal
and
are
bathed
night
and
morning
in
violet
water
until
the
fateful
occasion
after
which
they
are
returned
to
new
york
cleaner
if
not
wiser
children
it
is
a
great
charity
said
henrietta
dreamily
does
rockerbilt
make
any
charge
for
admission
to
these
teas
you
say
they
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
fund
oh
no
indeed
said
i
it
is
purely
a
private
charity
the
youngsters
get
their
ten
days
in
the
country
learn
good
manners
and
newport
society
has
a
pleasant
afternoon
all
at
rockerbilt
expense
h
said
henriette
pensively
h
i
think
there
is
a
better
method
ah
i
want
you
to
run
down
to
new
york
for
a
few
days
shortly
bunny
i
have
a
letter
i
wish
you
to
mail
nothing
more
was
said
on
the
subject
until
the
following
tuesday
when
i
was
despatched
to
new
york
with
instructions
to
organize
myself
into
a
winter
society
to
have
printed
with
the
names
of
some
of
the
most
prominent
ladies
in
society
as
patronesses
henriette
had
secured
permission
from
gaster
rockerbilt
innitt
the
duchess
of
snarleyow
willie
van
pelt
and
numerous
others
to
use
their
names
in
connection
with
the
new
enterprise
and
to
write
her
a
letter
asking
if
she
would
not
interest
herself
and
her
friends
in
the
needs
of
the
new
society
it
is
quite
as
important
the
letter
ran
that
there
should
be
a
fund
to
take
the
little
sufferers
of
our
dreadful
winters
away
from
the
sleet
and
streets
of
the
freezing
city
as
it
is
to
give
them
their
summer
outing
this
society
is
in
great
need
of
thousand
dollars
properly
to
prosecute
its
work
during
the
coming
winter
and
we
appeal
to
you
for
aid
henriette
personal
response
to
this
request
was
a
check
for
ten
thousand
dollars
which
as
secretary
and
treasurer
of
the
fund
i
acknowledged
and
then
of
course
returned
to
her
whereupon
her
campaign
began
in
earnest
her
own
enthusiasm
for
the
project
backed
up
by
her
most
generous
contribution
proved
contagious
and
inside
of
two
weeks
not
counting
henriette
check
we
were
in
possession
of
over
seventeen
thousand
dollars
one
lady
going
so
far
as
to
give
us
all
her
bridge
winnings
for
a
week
and
now
for
the
grand
coup
bunny
said
van
raffles
when
i
had
returned
with
the
spoil
great
scot
i
cried
have
you
got
enough
no
bunny
not
a
quarter
enough
she
replied
these
winter
resorts
are
very
expensive
places
and
while
seventeen
thousand
dollars
would
do
very
nicely
for
running
a
farm
in
summer
we
shall
need
quite
a
hundred
thousand
to
send
our
beneficiaries
to
palm
beach
in
proper
style
i
whistled
in
amazement
palm
beach
eh
yes
said
henriette
palm
beach
i
have
always
wanted
to
go
there
and
the
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
how
do
you
propose
to
get
that
i
demanded
i
shall
give
a
and
bazaar
for
the
benefit
of
the
fund
it
will
differ
from
rockerbilt
tea
in
that
i
shall
charge
ten
dollars
admission
ten
dollars
to
get
out
and
we
shall
sell
things
besides
i
have
already
spoken
to
gaster
about
it
and
she
is
delighted
with
the
idea
she
has
promised
to
stock
the
flower
table
with
the
cream
of
her
conservatories
rockerbilt
has
volunteered
to
take
charge
of
the
refreshments
the
duchess
of
snarleyow
is
dressing
a
doll
that
is
to
be
named
by
senator
defew
and
raffled
at
five
dollars
a
guess
is
to
take
entire
control
of
the
fancy
table
where
we
shall
sell
gold
solid
silver
automobile
and
other
necessities
of
life
among
the
select
i
do
see
how
the
thing
can
fail
do
you
not
so
far
said
i
each
of
the
twelve
lady
patronesses
has
promised
to
be
responsible
for
the
sale
of
a
hundred
tickets
of
admission
at
ten
dollars
apiece
that
makes
twelve
thousand
dollars
in
admissions
it
will
cost
each
person
ten
dollars
more
to
get
out
which
if
only
half
of
the
tickets
are
used
will
be
six
thousand
dollars
or
eighteen
thousand
dollars
in
entrance
and
exit
fees
alone
henriette
i
cried
enthusiastically
madam
humbert
was
an
amateur
alongside
of
you
van
raffles
smiled
thank
you
bunny
said
she
if
i
only
been
a
man
gad
i
ejaculated
wall
street
would
have
been
an
infant
in
your
hands
well
the
fateful
day
came
henriette
to
do
her
justice
had
herself
spared
no
pains
or
expense
to
make
the
thing
a
success
i
doubt
if
the
gardens
of
the
ever
looked
so
beautiful
there
were
flowers
everywhere
and
hanging
from
tree
to
tree
from
one
end
of
their
twenty
acres
to
the
other
were
long
and
graceful
garlands
of
multicolored
electric
lights
that
when
night
came
down
upon
the
fête
made
the
scene
appear
like
a
veritable
glimpse
of
fairyland
everybody
that
is
anybody
was
there
with
a
multitude
of
others
who
may
always
be
counted
upon
to
pay
well
to
see
their
names
in
print
or
to
get
a
view
of
society
at
close
range
of
course
there
was
music
of
an
entrancing
sort
the
numbers
being
especially
designed
to
touch
the
flintiest
of
hearts
and
henriette
was
everywhere
no
one
great
or
small
in
that
vast
gathering
but
received
one
of
her
gracious
smiles
and
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
half
of
the
flowers
purchased
at
rates
that
would
make
a
fifth
avenue
tailor
hang
his
head
in
shame
were
bought
by
the
gallant
gentlemen
of
newport
for
presentation
to
the
hostess
of
the
day
these
were
immediately
placed
on
sale
again
so
that
on
the
flower
account
the
receipts
were
perceptibly
swelled
a
more
festal
occasion
has
never
been
known
even
in
this
festal
environment
the
richest
of
the
land
vied
with
one
another
in
making
the
affair
a
vast
financial
success
the
ever
gallant
tommy
dare
left
the
scene
twenty
times
for
the
mere
privilege
of
paying
his
way
in
and
out
that
many
times
over
at
ten
dollars
each
way
the
doll
which
senator
defew
had
named
was
also
the
cause
of
much
merriment
since
when
all
was
over
and
some
thirteen
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
had
been
taken
in
for
guesses
it
was
found
that
the
senator
had
forgotten
the
name
he
had
given
it
when
the
laughter
over
this
incident
had
subsided
henriette
suggested
that
it
be
put
up
at
auction
which
plan
was
immediately
followed
out
with
the
result
that
the
handiwork
of
the
duchess
of
snarleyow
was
knocked
down
for
eight
thousand
six
hundred
and
dollars
to
a
cincinnati
brewer
who
had
been
trying
for
eight
years
to
get
his
name
into
the
social
register
thank
goodness
that
over
said
henriette
when
the
last
guest
had
gone
and
the
lights
were
out
it
has
been
a
very
delightful
affair
but
towards
the
end
it
began
to
get
on
my
nerves
i
am
really
appalled
bunny
at
the
amount
of
money
we
have
taken
in
did
you
get
the
full
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
asked
full
hundred
thousand
she
cried
hysterically
listen
to
this
and
she
read
the
following
memorandum
of
the
day
receipts
flower
table
doll
admissions
exits
candy
table
supper
table
book
table
coat
checks
total
great
heavens
what
a
haul
i
cried
but
how
much
did
you
spend
yourself
oh
about
twenty
thousand
dollars
bunny
i
really
felt
i
could
afford
it
we
net
not
less
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
i
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
chill
the
thing
scares
me
henriette
i
murmured
suppose
these
people
ask
you
next
winter
for
a
report
oh
laughed
henriette
i
shall
immediately
turn
the
money
over
to
the
fund
you
can
send
me
a
receipt
and
that
will
let
us
out
later
on
you
can
return
the
money
to
me
even
then
i
began
tush
bunny
said
she
there
is
going
to
be
any
even
then
six
months
from
now
these
people
will
have
forgotten
all
about
it
it
a
little
way
they
have
their
memory
for
faces
and
the
money
they
spend
is
shorter
than
the
purse
of
a
bankrupt
have
no
fear
and
as
usual
henriette
was
right
for
the
next
february
when
the
beneficiaries
of
the
winter
fund
spent
a
month
at
palm
beach
enjoying
the
best
that
favored
spot
afforded
in
the
way
of
entertainment
and
diversion
not
a
word
of
criticism
was
advanced
by
anybody
although
the
party
consisted
solely
of
van
raffles
her
maid
and
bunny
her
butler
in
fact
the
contrary
was
the
truth
the
people
we
met
while
there
many
of
whom
had
contributed
most
largely
to
the
fund
welcomed
us
with
open
arms
little
suspecting
how
intimately
connected
they
were
with
our
sources
of
supply
gaster
it
is
true
did
ask
henriette
how
the
winter
fund
was
doing
and
was
told
the
truth
that
it
was
doing
very
well
the
beneficiaries
did
very
well
here
said
henriette
i
have
seen
nothing
of
them
observed
gaster
well
no
said
henriette
the
managers
thought
it
was
better
to
send
them
here
before
the
season
was
at
its
height
the
moral
influences
of
palm
beach
at
the
top
of
the
season
are
well
a
trifle
strong
for
the
young
do
you
think
she
explained
the
i
hand
you
will
give
you
some
idea
of
how
much
one
of
the
beneficiaries
enjoyed
himself
there
is
nothing
finer
in
the
world
than
surf
bathing
in
winter
vii
the
adventure
of
rockerbilt
tiara
henriette
had
been
unwontedly
reserved
for
a
whole
week
a
fact
which
was
beginning
to
get
sadly
on
my
nerves
when
she
broke
an
almost
sphinxlike
silence
with
the
extraordinary
remark
bunny
i
am
sorry
but
i
do
see
any
other
way
out
of
it
you
must
get
married
to
say
that
i
was
shocked
by
the
observation
is
putting
it
mildly
as
you
must
by
this
time
have
realized
yourself
there
was
only
one
woman
in
the
world
that
i
could
possibly
bring
myself
to
think
fondly
of
and
that
woman
was
none
other
than
henriette
herself
i
could
not
believe
however
that
this
was
at
all
the
notion
she
had
in
mind
and
what
little
poise
i
had
was
completely
shattered
by
the
suggestion
i
drew
myself
up
with
dignity
however
in
a
moment
and
answered
her
very
well
dear
i
said
whenever
you
are
ready
i
am
you
must
have
banked
enough
by
this
time
to
be
able
to
support
me
in
the
style
to
which
i
am
accustomed
that
is
not
what
i
meant
bunny
she
retorted
coldly
frowning
at
me
well
it
what
mean
said
i
you
are
the
only
woman
i
ever
loved
but
bunny
dear
that
can
come
later
said
she
with
a
charming
little
blush
what
i
meant
my
dear
boy
was
not
a
permanent
affair
but
one
of
these
newport
marriages
not
necessarily
for
publication
but
as
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
she
explained
i
do
understand
said
i
affecting
denseness
for
i
understood
only
too
well
stupid
cried
henriette
i
need
a
confidential
maid
bunny
to
help
us
in
our
business
and
i
do
want
to
take
a
third
party
in
at
random
if
you
had
a
wife
i
could
trust
her
you
could
stay
married
as
long
as
we
needed
her
and
then
following
the
newport
plan
you
could
get
rid
of
her
and
marry
me
later
that
is
er
provided
i
was
willing
to
marry
you
at
all
and
i
am
not
so
sure
that
i
shall
not
be
some
day
when
i
am
old
and
toothless
i
fail
to
see
the
necessity
for
a
maid
of
that
kind
said
i
that
because
you
are
a
man
bunny
said
henriette
there
are
splendid
opportunities
for
acquiring
the
gems
these
newport
ladies
wear
by
one
who
may
be
stationed
in
the
there
is
rockerbilt
tiara
for
instance
it
is
at
present
the
finest
thing
of
its
kind
in
existence
and
of
priceless
value
when
she
is
wearing
it
it
is
kept
in
the
vaults
of
the
tiverton
trust
company
and
how
on
earth
we
are
to
get
it
without
the
assistance
of
a
maid
we
can
trust
i
see
except
in
the
vulgar
commonplace
way
of
sandbagging
the
lady
and
brutally
stealing
it
and
newport
society
has
quite
got
to
the
point
where
you
can
do
a
thing
like
that
to
a
woman
without
causing
talk
unless
you
are
married
to
her
well
i
tell
you
one
thing
henriette
i
returned
with
more
positiveness
than
i
commonly
show
i
will
not
marry
a
lady
maid
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
you
forget
that
i
am
a
gentleman
it
only
a
temporary
arrangement
bunny
she
pleaded
it
done
all
the
time
in
the
smart
set
well
the
morals
of
the
smart
set
are
not
my
morals
i
retorted
my
father
was
a
clergyman
henriette
and
i
something
of
a
churchman
myself
and
i
wo
stoop
to
such
baseness
besides
what
to
prevent
my
wife
from
blabbing
when
we
try
to
ship
her
h
mused
henriette
i
had
thought
of
that
it
would
be
dangerous
would
it
very
said
i
the
only
safe
way
out
of
it
would
be
to
kill
the
young
woman
and
my
religious
scruples
are
strongly
against
anything
of
the
sort
you
must
remember
henriette
that
there
are
one
or
two
of
the
commandments
that
i
hold
in
too
high
esteem
to
break
them
then
what
shall
we
do
bunny
demanded
van
raffles
must
have
that
well
there
the
old
amateur
theatrical
method
said
i
have
a
little
play
here
reproduce
rockerbilt
tiara
in
paste
for
one
of
the
characters
to
wear
substitute
the
spurious
for
the
real
and
there
you
are
that
is
a
good
idea
said
henriette
only
i
hate
amateur
theatricals
i
think
it
over
a
few
days
later
my
mistress
summoned
me
again
bunny
you
used
to
make
fairly
good
sketches
did
you
she
asked
pretty
good
said
i
chiefly
architectural
drawings
however
details
of
façades
and
ornamental
designs
just
the
thing
cried
henriette
rockerbilt
gives
a
moonlight
reception
on
her
lawns
they
adjoin
ours
she
will
wear
her
tiara
and
i
want
you
when
she
is
in
the
gardens
to
hide
behind
some
convenient
bit
of
shrubbery
and
make
an
exact
detail
sketch
of
the
tiara
understand
i
do
said
i
do
you
miss
a
ruby
or
a
diamond
or
the
teeniest
bit
of
filigree
bunny
get
the
whole
thing
to
a
carat
she
commanded
and
then
i
asked
excitedly
bring
it
to
me
i
attend
to
the
rest
said
she
illustration
it
was
not
always
easy
to
get
the
right
light
you
may
be
sure
that
when
night
came
i
went
at
the
work
in
hand
with
alacrity
it
was
not
always
easy
to
get
the
right
light
on
the
tiara
but
in
several
different
quarters
of
the
garden
i
got
her
sufficiently
well
though
unconsciously
posed
to
accomplish
my
purpose
once
i
nearly
yielded
to
the
temptation
to
reach
my
hand
through
the
shrubbery
and
snatch
the
superb
ornament
from
rockerbilt
head
for
she
was
quite
close
enough
to
make
this
possible
but
the
vulgarity
of
such
an
operation
was
so
very
evident
that
i
put
it
aside
almost
as
soon
as
thought
of
and
i
have
always
remembered
dear
old
remark
take
everything
in
sight
bunny
he
used
to
say
but
damn
it
do
it
like
a
gentleman
not
a
professional
the
sketch
made
i
took
it
to
my
room
and
colored
it
so
that
that
night
when
henriette
returned
i
had
ready
for
her
a
perfect
pictorial
representation
of
the
bauble
it
is
simply
perfect
bunny
she
cried
delightedly
as
she
looked
at
it
you
have
even
got
the
sparkle
of
that
incomparable
ruby
in
the
front
next
morning
we
went
to
new
york
and
henriette
taking
my
design
to
a
theatrical
we
knew
on
union
square
left
an
order
for
its
exact
reproduction
in
gilt
and
paste
i
am
going
to
a
little
dance
sikes
she
explained
as
queen
catharine
of
russia
and
this
tiara
is
a
copy
of
the
very
famous
lost
negligée
crown
of
that
unhappy
queen
do
you
think
you
can
let
me
have
it
by
tuesday
next
easily
madam
said
sikes
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
and
it
will
give
me
real
pleasure
to
reproduce
it
i
guarantee
it
will
be
so
like
the
original
that
the
queen
herself
could
tell
apart
it
will
cost
you
dollars
agreed
said
henriette
and
sikes
was
true
to
his
word
the
following
tuesday
afternoon
brought
to
my
new
york
apartment
for
of
course
raffles
did
not
give
sikes
her
right
name
an
absolutely
faultless
copy
of
chiefest
glory
it
was
so
like
that
none
but
an
expert
in
gems
could
have
told
the
copy
from
the
original
and
when
i
bore
the
package
back
to
newport
and
displayed
its
contents
to
my
mistress
she
flew
into
an
ecstasy
of
delight
we
have
the
original
in
a
week
if
you
keep
your
nerve
bunny
she
cried
theatricals
said
i
no
indeed
said
henriette
if
rockerbilt
knew
this
copy
was
in
existence
she
never
wear
the
other
in
public
again
as
long
as
she
lived
without
bringing
a
dozen
detectives
along
with
her
no
indeed
a
dinner
i
want
you
to
connect
the
electric
lights
of
the
with
the
at
my
foot
so
that
at
any
moment
i
can
throw
the
into
darkness
rockerbilt
will
sit
at
my
left
tommy
dare
to
the
right
she
will
wear
her
famous
coiffure
surmounted
by
the
tiara
at
the
moment
you
are
passing
the
poisson
i
will
throw
the
room
into
darkness
and
you
i
positively
decline
henriette
to
substitute
one
tiara
for
another
in
the
dark
why
darn
it
all
she
scream
the
minute
i
tried
it
i
protested
of
course
she
would
said
she
impatiently
and
that
is
why
i
propose
any
such
idiotic
performance
you
will
merely
stumble
in
the
dark
and
manage
your
elbow
so
awkwardly
that
rockerbilt
coiffure
will
be
entirely
disarranged
by
it
she
will
scream
of
course
and
i
will
instantly
restore
the
light
after
which
will
attend
to
the
substitution
now
do
fail
me
and
the
tiara
will
be
ours
illustration
all
was
as
henriette
had
foretold
i
stand
ready
with
affidavits
to
prove
that
that
dinner
was
the
most
exciting
affair
of
my
life
at
one
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
not
possibly
perform
my
share
of
the
conspiracy
without
detection
but
a
glance
at
henriette
sitting
calmly
and
coolly
and
beautiful
too
by
gad
at
the
head
of
the
table
chatting
as
affably
with
the
duke
of
snarleyow
and
tommy
dare
as
though
there
was
nothing
in
the
wind
nerved
me
to
action
the
moment
came
and
instantly
as
i
leaned
over
rockerbilt
side
with
the
fish
platter
in
my
hand
out
went
the
light
crash
went
my
elbow
into
the
lady
stunning
coiffure
her
little
scream
of
surprise
rent
the
air
and
flash
back
came
the
lights
again
all
was
as
henriette
had
foretold
lovely
blond
locks
were
frightfully
demoralized
and
the
famous
tiara
with
it
had
slid
aslant
athwart
her
cheek
dear
me
cried
henriette
rising
hurriedly
and
full
of
warm
sympathy
how
very
awkward
oh
do
speak
of
it
laughed
rockerbilt
amiably
it
is
nothing
dear
van
raffles
these
electric
lights
are
so
very
uncertain
these
days
and
i
am
sure
james
is
not
at
all
to
blame
for
hitting
me
as
he
has
done
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
only
may
i
please
run
and
fix
my
hair
again
you
most
certainly
shall
said
henriette
and
i
will
go
with
you
my
dear
emily
i
am
so
mortified
that
if
you
will
let
me
do
penance
in
that
way
i
will
myself
restore
order
out
of
this
lovely
chaos
the
little
speech
was
received
with
the
usual
hilarious
appreciation
which
follows
anything
out
of
the
usual
course
of
events
in
high
social
circles
tommy
dare
gave
three
cheers
for
van
raffles
and
gramercy
van
pelt
clad
in
a
gorgeous
red
costume
stood
up
on
a
chair
and
toasted
me
in
a
bumper
of
champagne
meanwhile
henriette
and
rockerbilt
had
gone
above
is
it
a
beauty
bunny
said
henriette
the
next
morning
as
she
held
up
the
tiara
to
my
admiring
gaze
a
flashing
coruscating
bit
of
the
jeweler
art
that
i
verily
believe
would
have
tempted
the
soul
of
honor
itself
into
rascally
ways
magnificent
i
asserted
but
which
is
this
the
one
or
the
original
the
original
said
henriette
caressing
the
bauble
you
see
when
we
got
to
my
room
last
night
and
i
had
rockerbilt
sitting
before
the
mirror
and
despite
her
protestations
was
fixing
her
dishevelled
locks
with
my
own
fair
hands
i
arranged
to
have
the
lights
go
out
again
just
as
the
tiara
was
laid
on
the
the
copy
was
in
the
table
drawer
and
while
my
right
hand
was
apparently
engaged
in
manipulating
the
refractory
light
and
my
voice
was
laughingly
calling
down
maledictions
upon
the
electric
lighting
company
for
its
wretched
service
my
left
hand
was
occupied
with
the
busiest
effort
of
its
career
in
substituting
the
spurious
tiara
for
the
other
and
rockerbilt
never
even
suspected
no
said
henriette
in
fact
she
placed
the
bogus
affair
in
her
hair
herself
as
far
as
her
knowledge
goes
i
never
even
touched
the
original
well
you
a
wonder
henriette
said
i
with
a
sigh
still
if
rockerbilt
should
ever
discover
she
wo
bunny
said
henriette
she
never
have
occasion
to
test
the
genuineness
of
her
tiara
these
newport
people
have
other
sources
of
income
than
the
vulgar
pawnshops
but
alas
later
on
henriette
made
a
discovery
herself
that
for
the
time
being
turned
her
eyes
red
with
weeping
the
rockerbilt
tiara
itself
was
as
bogus
as
our
own
copy
there
was
a
real
stone
in
the
whole
outfit
and
the
worst
part
of
it
was
that
under
the
circumstances
henriette
could
not
tell
anybody
over
the
teacups
that
rockerbilt
was
in
vulgar
parlance
putting
up
a
shine
on
high
society
viii
the
adventure
of
the
carnegie
library
merciful
midas
bunny
said
henriette
one
morning
as
i
was
removing
the
from
her
apartment
did
you
see
the
extent
of
carnegie
benefactions
in
the
published
list
this
morning
i
have
not
received
my
paper
yet
said
i
moreover
i
doubt
if
it
will
contain
any
reference
to
such
matters
when
it
does
come
you
know
i
read
only
the
london
van
raffles
i
have
been
able
to
go
the
american
newspapers
more
fool
you
then
bunny
laughed
my
mistress
any
man
who
wants
to
pursue
crime
as
a
polite
diversion
and
does
not
read
the
american
newspapers
fails
to
avail
himself
of
one
of
the
most
potent
instruments
for
the
attainment
of
the
highest
artistic
results
you
can
not
pick
up
a
newspaper
in
any
part
of
the
land
without
discovering
somewhere
in
its
columns
some
reference
to
a
new
variety
of
some
new
and
highly
artistic
method
of
writing
another
man
autograph
so
that
when
appended
to
a
check
and
presented
at
his
bank
it
will
bear
the
closest
scrutiny
to
which
the
will
subject
it
some
truly
napoleonic
method
of
entirely
novel
design
for
the
sudden
parting
of
the
rich
from
their
possessions
any
university
which
attempted
to
add
a
school
of
peculation
to
its
curriculum
and
ignored
the
daily
papers
as
a
positive
source
of
inspiration
to
the
highest
artistry
in
the
profession
would
fail
as
ignobly
as
though
it
should
forget
to
teach
the
fundamental
principles
of
high
finance
i
was
not
aware
of
their
proficiency
in
that
direction
said
i
you
never
will
get
on
bunny
sighed
henriette
because
you
are
not
quick
to
seize
opportunities
that
lie
directly
under
your
nose
how
do
you
suppose
i
first
learned
of
all
this
graft
at
newport
why
by
reading
the
newspaper
accounts
of
their
jewels
in
the
sunday
and
daily
newspapers
how
do
i
know
that
if
i
want
to
rockerbilt
and
rifle
his
pockets
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
station
myself
outside
the
crackerbaker
club
any
dark
opera
night
after
twelve
and
catch
him
on
his
way
home
with
his
fortune
sticking
out
all
over
him
because
the
newspapers
tell
me
that
he
is
a
regular
habitué
of
the
crackerbaker
and
plays
bridge
there
every
night
after
the
opera
how
do
i
know
just
how
to
walk
from
my
hall
bedroom
in
my
little
east
side
tenement
up
fifth
avenue
into
gaster
where
she
has
a
million
in
plate
on
her
buffet
with
my
eyes
shut
without
fear
of
stumbling
over
a
step
or
a
chair
or
even
a
footstool
because
the
newspapers
have
so
repeatedly
printed
diagrams
of
the
interior
of
the
lady
residence
that
its
halls
passages
doorways
exits
twists
turns
and
are
indelibly
engraved
upon
my
mind
how
did
i
acquire
my
wonderful
knowledge
of
the
exact
number
of
pearls
rubies
diamonds
opals
tiaras
bracelets
necklaces
stomachers
and
other
gorgeous
jewels
now
in
the
possession
of
the
smart
set
only
by
an
assiduous
devotion
to
the
contents
of
the
daily
newspapers
in
their
reports
of
the
doings
of
the
socially
elect
i
have
a
bunny
that
has
been
two
years
in
the
making
and
there
has
been
a
novel
burglary
reported
in
all
that
time
that
is
not
recorded
in
my
book
not
a
gem
that
has
appeared
at
the
opera
the
theatre
the
charity
ball
the
horse
show
or
a
monkey
dinner
that
has
not
been
duly
noted
in
this
vademecum
of
mine
fully
described
and
in
a
sense
located
if
it
was
for
that
knowledge
i
could
not
hope
for
success
any
more
than
you
could
if
you
went
hunting
in
the
desert
of
sahara
or
tried
to
lure
from
the
depths
of
an
empty
goldfish
globe
i
see
said
i
meekly
i
have
missed
a
great
opportunity
i
will
subscribe
to
the
and
right
away
i
have
never
understood
why
henriette
greeted
this
observation
with
a
peal
of
silvery
laughter
that
fairly
made
the
welkin
ring
all
i
know
is
that
it
so
irritated
me
that
i
left
the
room
to
keep
from
making
a
retort
that
might
seriously
have
disturbed
our
friendship
later
in
the
day
van
raffles
rang
for
me
and
i
attended
upon
her
orders
bunny
said
she
i
made
up
my
mind
to
it
i
must
have
a
carnegie
library
that
is
all
there
is
about
it
and
you
must
help
the
has
already
spent
million
dollars
on
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
do
see
why
if
other
people
can
get
we
ca
possibly
because
we
are
not
a
city
town
or
hamlet
i
suggested
for
i
had
been
looking
over
the
daily
papers
since
my
morning
talk
with
the
lady
and
had
observed
just
who
had
been
the
beneficiaries
of
carnegie
benefactions
he
do
give
to
individuals
but
to
communities
of
course
not
she
responded
quickly
but
what
is
to
prevent
our
becoming
a
municipality
my
answer
was
an
amazed
silence
for
frankly
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
guess
how
we
were
to
do
any
such
thing
it
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
she
continued
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
buy
an
abandoned
farm
on
long
island
with
a
bleak
divide
it
up
into
corner
lots
advertise
the
lots
for
sale
on
the
instalment
plan
elect
your
mayor
and
swept
by
ocean
breezes
fifteen
cents
from
the
battery
is
a
living
breathing
reality
by
the
jumping
disraeli
henriette
but
you
are
a
marvel
i
cried
with
enthusiasm
but
i
added
my
ardor
cooling
a
little
wo
it
cost
money
about
fifteen
hundred
dollars
said
henriette
i
can
win
that
at
bridge
in
an
hour
well
said
i
you
know
you
can
command
my
services
henriette
what
shall
i
do
organize
the
city
she
replied
here
is
fifty
dollars
that
will
do
for
a
starter
go
down
to
long
island
buy
the
farm
put
up
a
few
signs
calling
on
people
to
own
their
own
homes
advertise
the
place
in
big
capital
letters
in
the
sunday
papers
as
likely
to
be
the
port
of
the
future
consider
yourself
duly
elected
mayor
stop
in
at
some
photograph
shop
in
new
york
on
your
way
back
and
get
a
few
dozen
pictures
of
street
scenes
in
binghamton
oberlin
kalamazoo
and
other
cities
and
then
come
back
here
for
further
instructions
meanwhile
i
will
work
out
the
other
details
of
the
scheme
according
to
my
habit
i
followed
henriette
instructions
to
the
letter
a
farm
of
five
hundred
acres
was
secured
within
a
week
the
bleakest
coldest
spot
ever
swept
by
ocean
breezes
anywhere
it
cost
six
hundred
dollars
in
cash
with
immediate
possession
three
days
later
with
the
use
of
a
ruler
i
had
mapped
out
about
twelve
thousand
corner
lots
on
the
thing
and
thanks
to
my
knack
at
draughtsmanship
had
all
ready
for
anybody
inspection
as
fine
a
of
as
ever
was
got
up
by
a
company
in
this
or
any
other
country
i
then
secured
the
photographs
desired
by
my
mistress
advertised
raffleshurst
in
three
sunday
newspapers
to
the
tune
of
a
each
and
returned
to
newport
i
flattered
myself
that
the
thing
was
well
done
for
on
reading
the
advertisement
nothing
would
do
but
that
henriette
should
visit
the
place
in
person
the
ads
were
so
phrased
she
said
as
to
be
irresistible
it
fine
bunny
she
cried
with
an
enthusiastic
laugh
as
she
gazed
out
over
the
broad
acres
of
raffleshurst
and
noted
how
well
i
had
fulfilled
her
orders
under
proper
direction
you
are
a
most
able
workman
nothing
could
be
better
nothing
absolutely
nothing
and
now
for
mr
carnegie
i
still
did
not
see
how
the
thing
was
coming
out
but
such
was
my
confidence
in
my
leader
that
i
had
no
misgivings
here
is
a
letter
from
gaster
introducing
the
hon
henry
higginbotham
mayor
of
raffleshurst
to
carnegie
said
henriette
you
will
call
at
once
on
the
present
this
letter
keeping
in
mind
of
course
that
you
are
yourself
the
hon
henry
higginbotham
show
him
these
photographs
of
the
city
hall
at
binghamton
of
the
public
park
at
oberlin
the
high
school
at
oswego
the
battery
walk
at
charleston
and
other
public
improvements
of
various
other
cities
when
he
asks
you
what
sort
of
a
place
raffleshurst
is
then
frankly
and
fearlessly
put
in
your
application
for
a
library
one
picture
this
beautiful
photograph
of
the
at
the
louis
exhibition
you
must
seem
to
overlook
always
only
contrive
matters
so
that
he
will
inquire
what
it
is
you
must
then
modestly
remark
that
it
is
nothing
but
a
little
art
gallery
you
have
yourself
presented
to
the
town
see
h
yes
i
see
said
i
but
it
is
pretty
risky
business
henriette
suppose
gaster
asks
for
further
information
about
mayor
higginbotham
i
think
it
was
unwise
of
you
to
connect
her
with
the
enterprise
do
bother
about
that
bunny
wrote
that
letter
of
introduction
i
have
studied
penmanship
for
nothing
you
know
gaster
will
never
know
so
just
put
on
your
boldest
front
remember
your
name
and
do
forget
to
be
modest
about
your
own
art
gallery
that
will
inspire
him
i
think
it
took
me
a
week
to
get
at
the
but
finally
thanks
to
gaster
letter
of
introduction
i
succeeded
carnegie
was
as
always
in
a
most
amiable
frame
of
mind
and
received
me
cordially
even
when
he
discovered
my
real
business
with
him
illustration
you
wanted
a
lake
higginbotham
i
i
had
intended
to
give
any
more
libraries
this
year
he
said
as
he
glanced
over
the
pictures
i
am
giving
away
lakes
now
he
added
if
you
wanted
a
lake
higginbotham
i
we
have
such
a
large
already
carnegie
said
i
and
most
of
our
residents
are
young
married
couples
with
children
not
over
three
and
five
i
am
afraid
they
would
regard
a
lake
as
a
source
of
danger
that
a
pretty
playground
he
suggested
glancing
at
the
oberlin
park
somehow
or
other
it
reminds
me
of
something
i
thought
it
quite
likely
but
of
course
i
did
say
so
i
may
be
a
fool
but
i
have
some
tact
it
at
the
far
corner
of
the
park
that
we
propose
to
put
the
library
if
you
are
good
enough
to
let
us
have
it
was
all
i
ventured
h
he
mused
well
do
you
know
i
like
to
help
people
who
help
themselves
that
my
system
i
assured
him
that
we
of
raffleshurst
were
accustomed
to
helping
ourselves
to
everything
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
a
jest
which
even
though
it
was
only
too
true
seemed
to
strike
him
pleasantly
what
is
that
handsome
structure
you
always
pass
over
he
asked
as
i
contrived
to
push
the
photograph
aside
for
the
fifth
time
i
laughed
deprecatingly
oh
that
i
said
modestly
that
only
a
little
and
art
gallery
i
have
built
for
the
town
myself
oh
that
wonderful
henriette
how
did
she
know
that
generosity
even
among
the
overgenerous
was
infectious
indeed
said
carnegie
his
face
lighting
up
with
real
pleasure
well
higginbotham
i
guess
i
guess
i
do
it
i
ca
be
outdone
in
generosity
by
you
sir
and
er
i
guess
you
can
count
on
the
library
do
you
think
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollars
will
be
enough
well
of
course
i
began
why
not
make
my
contribution
equal
to
yours
and
call
it
an
even
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
he
interrupted
you
overwhelm
me
said
i
of
course
if
you
wish
to
and
the
raffleshurst
common
council
will
appropriate
five
per
cent
of
that
amount
annually
for
its
maintenance
he
inquired
such
a
resolution
has
already
been
passed
said
i
taking
a
paper
from
my
pocket
here
is
the
ordinance
duly
signed
by
myself
as
mayor
and
by
the
secretary
of
the
council
again
that
extraordinary
woman
to
provide
me
with
so
necessary
a
document
the
millionaire
rose
with
alacrity
and
with
his
own
hand
drew
me
the
required
check
mayor
said
he
i
like
the
quick
way
in
which
you
do
things
pray
present
my
compliments
to
the
citizens
of
and
tell
them
i
am
only
too
glad
to
help
them
if
you
ever
want
a
lake
sir
do
fail
to
call
upon
me
with
which
gracious
words
the
millionaire
bowed
me
out
hundred
thousand
dollars
bunny
cried
henriette
when
i
handed
her
the
check
yep
said
i
well
that
a
good
day
sport
she
said
gazing
at
the
slip
twice
as
much
as
i
expected
yes
said
i
but
see
here
henrietta
suppose
carnegie
should
go
down
to
raffleshurst
to
see
the
new
building
and
find
out
what
a
bunco
game
we
have
played
on
him
he
not
likely
to
do
that
for
two
reasons
bunny
she
replied
in
the
first
place
he
suffers
acutely
from
lumbago
in
winter
and
ca
travel
and
in
the
second
place
he
have
to
find
before
he
could
make
the
discovery
that
somebody
put
up
a
game
on
him
i
think
by
the
time
he
is
ready
to
start
we
can
arrange
matters
to
have
raffleshurst
taken
off
the
map
well
i
think
this
is
the
cleverest
trick
you
turned
yet
henriette
said
i
nonsense
bunny
nonsense
she
replied
any
idiot
can
get
a
carnegie
library
these
days
that
why
i
put
on
the
job
dear
she
added
affectionately
ix
the
adventure
of
the
now
that
it
is
all
over
i
do
not
know
whether
she
was
really
or
by
the
expert
use
of
powder
gave
to
her
cheeks
the
pallid
look
which
bore
out
van
raffles
statement
to
me
that
she
needed
a
rest
at
any
rate
one
morning
in
when
the
newport
season
was
in
full
feather
henriette
looking
very
pale
and
wan
tearfully
confessed
to
me
that
business
had
got
on
her
nerves
and
that
she
was
going
away
to
a
on
the
hudson
for
ten
days
i
just
ca
stand
it
for
another
minute
bunny
she
faltered
real
tears
coursing
down
her
cheeks
i
have
slept
a
wink
of
natural
sleep
for
five
days
and
yet
when
night
comes
it
is
all
i
can
do
to
keep
my
eyes
open
at
the
rockerbilt
ball
last
night
i
dozed
off
four
times
while
talking
with
the
duchess
of
snarleyow
and
when
the
chinese
ambassador
asked
me
to
sit
out
the
gavotte
with
him
i
told
i
actually
snored
in
his
face
a
woman
who
ca
keep
awake
all
night
and
sleep
properly
by
day
is
not
fit
for
newport
society
and
i
simply
got
to
go
away
and
get
my
nerve
back
again
you
are
very
wise
i
replied
and
i
wholly
approve
of
your
course
there
is
no
use
of
trying
to
do
too
much
and
you
have
begun
to
show
the
strain
to
which
you
have
been
subjecting
yourself
your
failure
last
friday
night
to
land
gollet
ruby
when
her
french
poodle
sat
in
your
lap
all
through
the
gaster
musicale
is
evidence
to
me
that
your
mind
is
not
as
alert
as
usual
by
all
means
go
away
and
rest
up
i
take
care
of
things
around
here
thank
you
dear
said
she
with
a
grateful
smile
you
need
a
change
too
bunny
what
would
you
say
if
i
sent
all
the
servants
away
too
so
that
you
could
have
a
week
of
absolute
tranquillity
it
must
be
awful
for
a
man
of
your
refined
sensibilities
to
have
to
associate
so
constantly
with
the
housemaids
the
and
the
footmen
nothing
would
please
me
better
i
returned
with
alacrity
for
to
tell
the
truth
society
below
stairs
was
rapidly
becoming
caviar
to
my
taste
the
housemaids
were
all
right
and
the
being
properly
subject
to
my
control
i
could
wither
when
they
grew
too
familiar
but
the
footmen
were
intolerable
guyers
on
more
than
one
occasion
their
quick
irish
wit
had
put
me
to
my
trumps
to
maintain
my
dignity
and
i
had
noticed
of
late
that
their
alleged
fun
at
my
expense
had
made
even
the
parlormaid
giggle
in
a
most
irritating
fashion
suggestion
promised
at
least
a
week
immunity
from
this
sort
of
thing
and
as
far
as
remaining
alone
in
the
beautiful
bolivar
lodge
was
concerned
to
a
man
of
my
literary
and
artistic
tastes
nothing
could
be
more
desirable
i
can
put
in
a
week
of
solitude
here
very
comfortably
said
i
the
have
a
very
excellent
library
and
a
line
of
reading
in
abstract
morals
in
full
calf
that
i
should
very
much
like
to
get
at
so
be
it
then
said
henriette
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
will
take
my
departure
next
saturday
after
the
innitt
on
honk
island
the
servants
can
go
saturday
afternoon
after
the
house
has
been
put
in
order
you
can
order
a
fresh
supply
of
champagne
and
cigars
for
yourself
and
as
for
your
meals
do
you
bother
about
that
said
i
with
a
laugh
i
lived
for
months
on
the
before
i
found
you
again
and
i
rather
think
the
change
from
game
birds
and
pâté
de
foie
gras
to
simple
eggs
and
bread
and
butter
will
do
me
good
and
so
the
matter
was
arranged
the
servants
were
notified
that
owing
to
van
raffles
illness
they
might
take
a
vacation
on
full
pay
for
ten
days
and
henriette
herself
prepared
society
for
her
departure
by
fainting
twice
at
the
innit
on
honk
island
no
less
a
person
than
gaster
herself
brought
her
home
at
four
in
the
morning
and
her
last
words
were
an
exhortation
to
her
van
raffles
to
be
careful
of
herself
for
all
our
sakes
saturday
morning
henriette
departed
saturday
afternoon
the
servants
followed
suit
and
i
was
alone
in
my
glory
and
oh
how
i
revelled
in
it
the
beauties
of
bolivar
lodge
had
never
so
revealed
themselves
to
me
as
then
the
house
as
dark
as
the
tomb
without
thanks
to
the
closing
of
the
shutters
and
the
drawing
to
of
all
the
heavy
portières
before
the
windows
but
a
blaze
of
light
within
from
cellar
to
roof
i
spent
whole
hours
gloating
over
the
treasures
of
that
and
all
day
sunday
and
monday
i
spent
poring
over
the
books
in
the
library
a
marvellous
collection
though
for
the
most
part
wholly
uncut
everything
moved
along
serenely
until
wednesday
afternoon
when
i
thought
i
heard
a
noise
in
the
cellar
but
investigation
revealed
the
presence
of
no
one
but
a
stray
cat
which
miaowed
up
the
cellar
steps
to
me
in
response
to
my
call
of
who
there
true
i
did
not
go
down
to
see
if
any
one
were
there
not
caring
to
involve
myself
in
a
personal
encounter
with
a
chance
tramp
who
might
have
wandered
in
in
search
of
food
the
sudden
materialization
of
the
cat
satisfactorily
explained
the
noises
and
i
returned
to
the
library
to
resume
my
reading
of
origin
of
the
where
i
had
left
off
at
the
moment
of
the
interruption
that
evening
i
cooked
myself
a
and
at
eight
arrayed
in
my
pajamas
i
returned
to
the
library
with
a
book
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
a
box
of
vencedoras
prepared
for
a
quiet
evening
of
absolute
luxury
i
read
in
the
waning
light
of
the
dying
midsummer
day
for
a
little
while
and
then
as
darkness
came
on
i
turned
to
the
to
light
the
electric
lamp
lamp
would
not
i
pressed
and
pressed
every
button
in
the
room
but
with
no
better
results
and
then
going
through
the
house
i
tried
every
other
button
i
could
find
but
everywhere
conditions
were
the
same
apparently
there
was
something
the
matter
with
the
electrical
service
a
fact
which
i
cursed
but
not
deeply
for
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
while
of
course
i
was
disappointed
in
my
reading
i
realized
that
after
all
nothing
could
be
pleasanter
than
to
sit
in
the
moonlight
and
smoke
and
quaff
bumpers
of
champagne
until
the
crack
of
doom
this
i
immediately
proceeded
to
do
and
kept
at
it
pretty
steadily
until
i
should
say
about
eleven
when
i
heard
unmistakable
signs
of
a
large
automobile
coming
up
the
drive
it
chugged
as
far
as
the
and
then
stood
panting
like
an
impatient
while
the
chauffeur
a
person
of
medium
height
well
muffled
in
his
automobile
coat
his
features
concealed
behind
his
goggles
and
his
mouth
covered
by
his
collar
rapped
loudly
on
the
once
then
a
second
time
who
the
devil
can
this
be
at
this
hour
of
the
night
i
wonder
i
muttered
as
i
responded
to
the
summons
if
i
sought
the
name
i
was
not
to
be
gratified
for
the
moment
i
opened
the
door
i
found
two
pistols
levelled
upon
me
and
two
very
determined
eyes
peering
at
me
from
behind
the
goggles
not
a
word
or
i
shoot
said
the
intruder
in
a
gruff
voice
evidently
assumed
before
i
could
get
a
word
from
my
already
somewhat
tongue
lead
me
to
the
well
there
i
was
defenceless
taken
by
surprise
unarmed
not
too
wide
awake
comfortably
filled
with
champagne
and
in
no
particularly
fighting
mood
what
could
i
do
but
yield
to
call
for
help
would
have
brought
at
least
two
bullets
crashing
into
my
brain
even
if
any
one
could
have
heard
my
cries
to
assault
a
scoundrel
so
would
have
been
the
height
of
folly
and
to
tell
the
truth
so
imbued
was
i
with
the
politer
spirit
of
the
gentle
art
of
that
this
sudden
confrontation
with
the
ruder
methods
of
the
highwayman
left
me
entirely
unable
to
cope
with
the
situation
certainly
said
i
turning
and
ushering
him
down
the
hall
to
the
great
where
the
marvellous
plate
of
the
shone
effulgently
upon
the
sideboard
or
at
least
such
of
it
as
there
was
no
room
for
in
the
massive
safe
get
me
some
rope
commanded
the
intruder
still
under
the
range
of
those
dreadful
pistols
i
obeyed
sit
down
in
that
chair
and
by
the
leaping
gladstone
if
you
move
an
inch
i
blow
your
face
off
feature
by
feature
growled
the
intruder
who
moving
i
retorted
angrily
well
see
that
whoever
else
is
you
are
not
he
retorted
winding
the
rope
three
times
around
my
waist
and
fastening
me
securely
to
the
back
of
the
chair
now
hold
out
your
hands
i
obeyed
and
he
bound
them
as
tightly
as
though
they
were
fastened
together
with
rods
of
iron
a
moment
later
my
feet
and
knees
were
similarly
bound
and
i
was
as
fast
in
the
toils
as
gulliver
when
the
liliputians
fell
upon
him
in
his
sleep
and
bound
him
to
the
earth
illustration
as
keen
and
a
performance
as
i
ever
witnessed
and
then
i
was
a
mute
witness
to
as
keen
and
a
performance
as
i
ever
witnessed
one
by
one
every
item
of
the
silver
service
valued
at
ninety
thousand
dollars
was
removed
from
the
sideboard
and
taken
along
the
hall
and
placed
in
the
tonneau
of
the
automobile
next
the
safe
in
which
lay
not
only
the
famous
gold
service
used
only
at
the
very
swellest
functions
said
to
have
cost
one
hundred
and
thousand
dollars
for
the
gold
alone
to
say
nothing
of
the
exquisite
workmanship
but
it
made
me
gnash
my
teeth
in
impotent
rage
to
see
it
henriette
own
containing
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
her
own
gems
and
some
thirty
thousand
dollars
in
cash
was
rifled
of
its
contents
and
disposed
of
similarly
to
the
silver
in
the
gaping
maw
of
that
damned
automobile
tonneau
now
said
the
intruder
loosening
my
feet
and
releasing
me
from
the
chair
take
me
to
my
lady
boudoir
there
is
room
in
the
car
for
a
few
more
objects
of
virtu
i
obeyed
on
the
instant
and
a
few
moments
later
the
scene
of
was
repeated
with
me
powerless
to
resist
pictures
and
other
things
to
the
tune
of
twenty
thousand
dollars
more
were
removed
as
calmly
and
as
coolly
as
though
there
were
no
law
against
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
world
there
cried
the
highwayman
as
he
returned
after
the
last
item
of
his
loot
had
been
stowed
away
in
the
vehicle
that
make
an
interesting
tale
for
friday
morning
papers
it
the
biggest
haul
made
in
years
sir
when
i
am
safely
out
of
town
i
telegraph
the
police
to
come
and
rescue
you
from
your
present
awkward
position
and
let
me
tell
you
if
you
give
them
the
slightest
hint
of
my
personal
appearance
by
the
hopping
harcourt
i
come
back
and
kill
you
see
and
with
that
he
made
off
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
a
moment
later
i
heard
his
infernal
automobile
chugging
down
the
drive
at
full
speed
twelve
hours
later
in
response
to
a
telephone
message
from
new
york
the
police
came
bounding
around
to
the
house
and
found
me
tied
up
and
unconscious
the
highwayman
had
at
least
been
true
to
his
word
and
as
he
had
prophesied
the
morning
papers
on
friday
were
full
of
the
story
of
the
most
daring
robbery
of
the
century
accurate
stories
in
detail
under
huge
headlines
appeared
in
all
the
papers
narrating
the
losses
of
the
as
well
as
the
rape
of
the
jewels
and
money
of
van
raffles
the
whole
country
rang
with
it
and
the
afternoon
train
brought
not
only
detectives
by
the
score
but
the
representative
of
the
and
henriette
herself
she
was
highly
hysterical
over
the
loss
not
only
of
her
own
property
but
that
of
her
landlord
as
well
but
nobody
blamed
me
the
testimony
of
the
police
as
to
my
condition
when
found
fully
substantiated
my
story
and
was
accepted
as
ample
evidence
that
i
had
no
criminal
connection
with
the
robbery
this
was
a
great
relief
to
me
but
it
was
greater
when
henriette
stroked
my
hand
and
called
me
poor
old
bunny
for
i
must
say
i
was
worried
as
to
what
she
would
think
of
me
for
having
proven
so
poor
a
guardian
of
her
property
since
then
months
have
passed
and
not
a
vestige
of
the
stolen
property
has
been
recovered
the
bore
their
loss
with
equanimity
as
became
them
since
no
one
could
have
foreseen
such
a
misfortune
as
overtook
them
and
as
for
van
raffles
she
never
mentioned
the
matter
again
to
me
save
once
and
that
set
me
to
thinking
he
was
a
clever
rascal
you
say
bunny
she
asked
one
morning
yes
said
i
one
of
the
best
in
the
business
i
fancy
a
big
fellow
she
grinned
with
a
queer
smile
oh
about
your
height
said
i
well
by
the
hopping
harcourt
she
retorted
quizzically
if
you
give
them
the
slightest
hint
of
personal
appearance
i
come
back
and
kill
you
see
man
very
words
and
then
she
laughed
what
i
cried
it
was
you
was
it
she
returned
airily
why
the
devil
you
should
go
to
all
that
trouble
when
you
had
the
stuff
right
here
is
what
puzzles
me
said
i
oh
it
was
any
trouble
she
replied
just
sport
you
looked
so
funny
sitting
up
there
in
your
pajamas
and
besides
a
material
fact
such
as
that
is
apt
to
be
more
convincing
to
the
police
to
say
nothing
of
the
than
any
mere
story
we
could
invent
well
you
better
be
careful
henriette
i
said
with
a
shiver
the
detectives
are
clever
true
bunny
she
answered
gravely
but
you
see
the
highwayman
was
a
man
and
well
i
a
woman
dear
i
can
prove
an
alibi
you
left
the
unlocked
that
wednesday
i
found
it
open
when
i
sneaked
in
to
cut
off
the
electric
lights
you
must
be
so
careless
dear
or
we
may
have
to
divvy
up
our
spoil
with
others
marvellous
woman
that
henriette
x
the
adventure
of
shadd
musicale
henriette
was
visibly
angry
the
other
morning
when
i
took
to
her
the
early
mail
and
she
discovered
that
van
varick
shadd
had
got
ahead
of
her
in
the
matter
of
jockobinski
the
monkey
virtuoso
society
had
been
very
much
interested
in
the
reported
arrival
in
america
of
this
wonderfully
talented
simian
who
could
play
the
violin
as
well
as
ysaye
and
who
as
a
performer
on
the
piano
was
vastly
the
superior
of
paderewski
because
taken
in
his
infancy
and
specially
trained
for
the
purpose
he
could
play
with
his
feet
and
tail
as
well
as
with
his
hands
it
had
been
reported
by
tommy
dare
the
leading
newport
authority
on
monkeys
that
he
had
heard
him
play
brahm
variations
on
paganini
with
his
paws
on
a
piano
hiawatha
on
a
xylophone
with
his
feet
and
home
sweet
home
with
his
tail
on
a
harp
simultaneously
in
paris
a
year
ago
and
that
alongside
of
jockobinski
all
other
musical
prodigies
of
the
age
became
mere
strummers
he
a
whole
orchestra
in
himself
said
tommy
enthusiastically
and
is
the
only
living
creature
that
i
know
of
who
can
tackle
a
whole
symphony
without
the
aid
of
a
hired
man
of
course
society
was
on
the
for
a
genius
of
so
riotous
an
order
as
this
and
all
the
wealthy
families
of
newport
vied
with
one
another
for
the
privilege
of
being
first
to
welcome
him
to
our
shores
not
because
he
was
a
freak
mind
you
but
for
art
sweet
sake
offered
hundred
dollars
for
him
as
a
guest
and
gaster
immediately
went
her
bid
a
hundred
per
cent
better
henriette
in
order
to
outdo
every
one
else
promptly
put
in
a
bid
of
ten
thousand
dollars
for
a
single
evening
and
had
supposed
the
bargain
closed
when
along
came
shadd
cards
announcing
that
she
would
be
pleased
to
have
van
raffles
at
onyx
house
on
friday
evening
august
to
meet
herr
jockobinski
the
eminent
virtuoso
it
very
annoying
said
henriette
as
she
opened
and
read
the
invitation
i
had
quite
set
my
heart
on
having
jockobinski
here
not
that
i
care
particularly
about
the
music
end
of
it
but
because
there
is
nothing
that
gives
a
woman
so
assured
a
social
position
as
being
the
hostess
of
an
animal
of
his
particular
kind
you
remember
bunny
how
completely
shadd
wrested
the
leadership
from
gaster
two
seasons
ago
with
her
orang
outang
dinner
do
you
i
confessed
to
having
read
something
about
such
an
incident
in
high
society
well
said
henriette
would
have
thrown
that
little
episode
wholly
in
the
shade
of
course
shadd
is
doing
this
to
retain
her
grip
but
it
irritates
me
more
than
i
can
say
to
have
her
get
it
just
the
same
heaven
knows
i
was
willing
to
pay
for
it
if
i
had
to
abscond
with
a
national
bank
to
get
the
money
it
is
too
late
is
it
i
queried
not
too
late
echoed
henriette
not
too
late
with
shadd
cards
out
and
the
whole
thing
published
in
the
papers
it
never
too
late
for
a
woman
of
your
resources
to
do
anything
she
has
a
mind
to
do
said
i
it
seems
to
me
that
a
person
who
could
swipe
a
carnegie
library
the
way
you
did
should
have
little
difficulty
in
lifting
a
musicale
of
course
i
do
know
how
you
could
do
it
but
with
mind
well
i
should
be
surprised
and
disappointed
if
you
could
devise
some
plan
to
accomplish
your
desires
henriette
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
her
face
lit
up
with
one
of
her
most
charming
smiles
bunny
do
you
know
that
at
times
in
spite
of
your
supreme
stupidity
you
are
a
source
of
positive
inspiration
to
me
she
said
looking
at
me
fondly
i
ventured
to
think
i
am
glad
if
it
is
so
said
i
sometimes
dear
henriette
you
will
find
the
most
beautiful
flowers
growing
out
of
the
blackest
mud
perhaps
hid
in
the
dull
residuum
of
my
poor
but
honest
gray
matter
lies
the
seed
of
real
genius
that
will
sprout
the
loveliest
blossoms
of
achievement
well
anyhow
dear
you
have
started
me
thinking
and
maybe
we
have
jockobinski
at
bolivar
lodge
yet
she
murmured
i
want
to
have
him
first
of
course
or
not
at
all
to
be
second
in
doing
a
thing
of
that
kind
is
worse
than
never
doing
it
at
all
days
went
by
and
not
another
word
was
spoken
on
the
subject
of
jockobinski
and
the
musicale
and
i
began
to
feel
that
at
last
henriette
had
reached
the
end
of
her
ingenuity
though
for
my
own
part
i
could
not
blame
her
if
she
failed
to
find
some
plausible
way
out
of
her
disappointment
wednesday
night
came
and
consumed
by
curiosity
to
learn
just
how
the
matter
stood
i
attempted
to
sound
henriette
on
the
subject
i
should
like
friday
evening
off
van
raffles
said
i
if
you
are
going
to
shadd
musicale
you
will
have
no
use
for
me
shut
up
bunny
she
returned
abruptly
i
shall
need
you
friday
night
more
than
ever
before
just
take
this
note
over
to
shadd
this
evening
and
leave
it
mind
you
do
wait
for
an
answer
but
just
leave
it
that
all
she
arose
from
the
table
and
handed
me
a
daintily
scented
missive
addressed
to
shadd
and
i
faithfully
executed
her
errand
bunderby
the
shadd
butler
endeavored
to
persuade
me
to
wait
for
an
answer
but
assuring
him
that
i
was
aware
that
an
answer
was
expected
i
returned
to
bolivar
lodge
an
hour
later
bunderby
appeared
at
the
back
door
and
handed
me
a
note
addressed
to
my
mistress
which
i
immediately
delivered
is
bunderby
waiting
asked
henriette
as
she
read
the
note
yes
i
answered
tell
him
to
hand
this
to
shadd
the
very
first
thing
upon
her
return
evening
she
said
hastily
scribbling
off
a
note
and
putting
it
in
an
envelope
which
by
chance
she
left
unsealed
so
that
on
my
way
back
i
was
able
to
read
it
what
it
said
was
that
she
would
be
only
too
happy
to
oblige
shadd
and
was
very
sorry
indeed
to
hear
that
her
son
had
been
injured
in
an
automobile
accident
while
running
into
boston
from
bar
harbor
it
closed
with
the
line
you
must
know
my
dear
pauline
that
there
is
anything
i
would
do
for
you
come
weal
or
come
woe
this
i
handed
to
bunderby
and
he
made
off
on
my
return
henriette
was
dressed
for
travel
i
must
take
the
first
train
for
new
york
she
said
excitedly
you
will
have
the
prepared
at
once
bunny
shadd
musicale
will
be
given
here
i
am
going
myself
to
make
all
the
necessary
arrangements
at
the
new
york
end
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
get
things
ready
and
rely
on
your
ignorance
for
everything
else
see
i
could
only
reflect
that
if
a
successful
issue
were
dependent
upon
my
ignorance
i
had
a
plentiful
supply
of
it
to
fall
back
on
henriette
made
off
at
once
for
providence
by
and
got
the
midnight
train
out
of
boston
for
the
city
where
from
what
i
learned
afterwards
she
must
have
put
in
a
strenuous
day
on
thursday
at
any
rate
a
great
sensation
was
sprung
on
newport
on
friday
morning
every
member
of
the
smart
set
in
the
mail
received
a
little
engraved
card
stating
that
owing
to
sudden
illness
in
the
shadd
family
the
shadd
musicale
for
that
evening
would
be
held
at
bolivar
lodge
instead
of
in
the
onyx
house
ballroom
friday
afternoon
jockobinski
private
and
particular
piano
arrived
at
the
lodge
and
was
set
up
promptly
in
the
and
later
when
the
caterers
arrived
with
the
supper
for
the
four
hundred
odd
guests
bidden
to
the
feast
all
was
in
readiness
for
them
everything
was
running
smoothly
and
although
henriette
had
not
yet
arrived
i
felt
easy
and
secure
of
mind
until
nearing
when
shadd
herself
drove
up
to
the
her
color
was
unusually
high
and
had
she
been
any
but
a
lady
of
the
i
should
have
said
that
she
was
flustered
she
demanded
rather
than
asked
to
see
my
mistress
with
a
hauteur
born
of
the
arctic
snow
van
raffles
went
to
new
york
wednesday
evening
said
i
and
has
not
yet
returned
i
am
expecting
her
every
minute
madame
she
must
be
here
for
the
musicale
wo
you
wait
indeed
i
will
said
she
abruptly
the
musicale
indeed
humph
and
she
plumped
herself
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
so
hard
that
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
keep
from
showing
some
very
unbutlerian
concern
for
the
safety
of
the
furniture
i
must
say
i
did
not
envy
henriette
the
meeting
that
was
in
prospect
for
it
was
quite
evident
that
shadd
was
mad
all
through
in
spite
of
my
stupidity
i
rather
thought
i
could
divine
the
cause
too
she
was
not
kept
long
in
waiting
for
ten
minutes
later
the
automobile
with
henriette
in
it
came
thundering
up
the
drive
i
tried
as
i
let
her
in
to
give
her
a
hint
of
what
awaited
her
but
shadd
forestalled
me
only
however
to
be
forestalled
herself
oh
my
dear
pauline
henriette
cried
as
she
espied
her
waiting
visitor
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
over
i
pretty
well
fagged
out
with
all
the
arrangements
for
the
night
and
i
hope
your
son
is
better
my
son
is
not
ill
van
raffles
said
shadd
coldly
i
have
come
to
ask
you
what
not
ill
cried
henriette
interrupting
her
not
ill
pauline
why
breathlessly
that
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
ever
heard
of
why
am
giving
the
musicale
then
instead
of
you
that
is
precisely
what
i
have
come
to
find
out
said
shadd
why
well
of
all
queer
things
said
henriette
flopping
down
in
a
chair
surely
you
got
my
note
saying
that
i
would
let
jockobinski
play
here
instead
of
i
did
receive
a
very
peculiar
note
from
you
saying
that
you
would
gladly
do
as
i
wished
said
shadd
beginning
herself
to
look
less
angry
and
more
puzzled
in
reply
to
your
note
of
wednesday
evening
said
henriette
certainly
you
wrote
to
me
wednesday
evening
it
was
delivered
by
your
own
man
blunderby
i
think
his
name
is
about
seven
it
was
wednesday
yes
bunderby
did
carry
a
note
to
you
from
me
on
wednesday
said
shadd
but
and
in
it
you
said
that
you
were
called
to
boston
by
an
accident
to
your
son
willie
in
his
automobile
that
you
might
not
be
able
to
get
back
in
time
for
affair
and
would
i
take
it
over
protested
van
raffles
vehemently
i
said
shadd
showing
more
surprise
than
was
compatible
with
her
high
social
position
and
attend
to
all
the
details
your
very
words
my
dear
pauline
said
henriette
with
an
admirably
timed
break
in
her
voice
and
i
did
and
told
you
i
i
immediately
put
on
my
travelling
gown
motored
to
providence
had
an
ride
to
new
york
on
a
very
uncomfortable
sleeper
went
at
once
to
herr
jockobinski
agent
and
arranged
the
change
notified
sherry
to
send
the
supper
to
my
house
instead
of
yours
drove
to
tiffany
and
had
the
cards
rushed
through
and
mailed
to
everybody
on
your
list
you
know
you
kindly
gave
me
your
list
when
i
first
came
to
newport
and
attended
to
the
whole
thing
and
now
i
come
back
to
find
it
all
a
er
a
mistake
why
pauline
it
positively
awful
what
we
do
henriette
was
a
perfect
picture
of
despair
i
do
suppose
we
can
do
anything
now
said
shadd
ruefully
it
too
late
the
cards
have
gone
to
everybody
you
have
all
the
supper
not
a
sandwich
has
come
to
my
house
and
i
presume
all
of
jockobinski
instruments
as
well
have
come
here
henriette
turned
to
me
all
madame
said
i
briefly
well
said
shadd
tapping
the
floor
nervously
with
her
toe
i
do
understand
it
wrote
that
note
oh
but
shadd
i
have
it
here
said
henriette
opening
her
purse
and
extracting
the
paper
you
can
read
it
for
yourself
what
else
could
i
do
after
that
innocence
on
a
monument
could
have
appeared
no
freer
of
guile
than
henriette
at
that
moment
she
handed
the
note
to
shadd
who
perused
it
with
growing
amazement
is
that
your
handwriting
and
your
crest
and
your
paper
asked
henriette
appealingly
it
certainly
looks
like
it
said
shadd
if
i
did
know
i
written
it
i
would
have
sworn
i
had
where
could
it
have
come
from
i
supposed
it
came
from
onyx
house
said
henriette
simply
glancing
at
the
envelope
well
it
a
very
mysterious
affair
said
shadd
rising
and
i
oh
well
my
dear
woman
i
i
ca
blame
you
indeed
after
all
you
have
done
i
ought
to
be
and
really
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
only
whom
did
you
have
at
dinner
wednesday
night
dear
asked
henriette
only
the
duke
and
duchess
of
snarleyow
and
mercy
i
wonder
if
he
could
have
done
it
who
asked
henriette
dare
ejaculated
shadd
her
eyes
beginning
to
twinkle
do
you
suppose
this
is
one
of
tommy
dare
jokes
h
mused
henriette
and
then
she
laughed
it
would
be
unlike
him
would
it
not
a
bit
the
naughty
boy
cried
shadd
that
it
van
raffles
as
certainly
as
we
stand
here
suppose
just
to
worry
him
we
never
let
on
that
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
has
happened
eh
splendid
said
henriette
with
enthusiasm
let
act
as
if
all
turned
out
just
as
we
expected
and
best
of
all
even
mention
it
to
him
or
to
bunderby
his
confederate
neither
of
us
never
said
shadd
rising
and
kissing
henriette
the
best
way
out
of
it
if
we
did
we
be
the
of
all
newport
but
some
day
in
the
distant
future
tommy
dare
would
better
look
out
for
pauline
shadd
van
raffles
and
so
it
was
agreed
and
henriette
successfully
landed
musicale
incidentally
jockobinski
was
very
affable
and
the
function
went
off
well
everybody
was
there
and
no
one
would
for
a
moment
have
thought
that
there
was
anything
strange
in
the
transfer
of
the
scene
from
onyx
house
to
bolivar
lodge
who
wrote
that
letter
henriette
i
asked
late
in
the
evening
when
the
last
guest
had
gone
who
do
you
suppose
bunny
my
boy
she
asked
with
a
grin
bunderby
no
said
i
you
guessed
right
said
henriette
as
a
postscript
let
me
say
that
until
he
reads
this
i
do
believe
tommy
dare
ever
guessed
what
a
successful
joke
he
perpetrated
upon
shadd
and
the
fair
henriette
even
then
i
doubt
if
he
realizes
what
a
good
one
it
was
on
everybody
xi
the
adventure
of
innitt
cook
it
is
curious
bunny
said
henriette
the
other
morning
after
an
unusually
late
breakfast
to
observe
by
what
qualities
certain
of
these
newport
families
have
arrived
as
the
saying
is
the
gasters
of
course
belong
at
the
top
by
patent
right
having
invented
american
society
or
at
least
the
machine
that
at
present
controls
it
they
are
entitled
to
all
the
royalties
it
brings
in
the
rockerbilts
got
there
all
of
a
sudden
by
the
sheer
lavishness
of
their
entertainment
and
their
ability
to
give
bonds
to
keep
it
up
the
van
varick
shadds
flowed
in
through
their
unquestioned
affiliation
with
the
delaware

to
the
fact

two

are
safely
anchored
in
the
social
haven
where
they
would
be

the
rumor
that
has
written

is

fixes
her
firmly
in

the

interesting
it
does
interest
me
much
quoth
i
indeed
this
american
smart
set
do
appeal
to
me
either
for
its
smartness
or
its
setness
bunny
cried
henriette
with
a
silvery
ripple
of
laughter
do
be
careful
an
epigram
from
you
my
dear
boy
you
be
down
with
if
you
do
watch
out
humph
said
i
with
a
shrug
of
my
shoulders
neither
you
nor
my
dear
old
friend
raffles
ever
gave
me
credit
for
any
brains
i
have
a
few
however
which
i
use
when
occasion
demands
i
drawled
well
do
waste
them
here
bunny
laughed
henriette
save
for
some
place
where
they
be
appreciated
maybe
in
your
old
age
you
be
back
in
dear
old
london
contributing
to
if
you
are
careful
of
your
wits
but
how
do
you
suppose
the
ever
got
in
here
he
holds
the
divorce
record
i
believe
said
i
he
been
married
to
four
social
leaders
already
has
he
yes
well
he
got
into
the
swim
with
each
marriage
so
he
got
a
grip
said
i
and
the
asked
henriette
how
do
you
account
for
them
most
attractive
diners
and
weekenders
said
i
they
got
all
the
laughs
at
your
dinner
to
the
archbishop
of
decanterbury
and
their
man
smathers
tells
me
they
the
swellest
things
going
at
parties
because
of
his
ingenuity
at
cotillion
leading
and
her
undeniable
charms
as
a
flirt
by
jove
she
that
easy
with
men
that
even
i
tremble
with
anxiety
whenever
she
comes
into
the
house
but
how
do
they
live
they
have
a
cent
to
their
names
said
henriette
simplicity
itself
said
i
he
is
dressed
by
his
tailors
and
she
by
her
dressmaker
and
as
for
food
they
take
home
a
full
of
it
from
every
they
attend
they
so
gracious
to
the
servants
that
they
do
have
to
think
of
tips
and
as
for
smathers
and
maid
they
paid
reporters
on
the
staff
of
town
and
are
willing
to
serve
for
nothing
for
the
opportunities
for
items
the
connection
gives
them
well
i
do
envy
them
in
the
least
said
henriette
poor
things
to
be
always
taking
and
never
giving
must
be
an
awful
strain
though
to
be
sure
their
little
trolley
party
out
to
tiverton
and
back
was
delightful
exactly
and
with
and
sandwiches
and
the
champagne
supplied
free
by
the
importers
for
the
advertisement
it
cost
them
exactly
twelve
dollars
and
was
set
down
as
the
jolliest
affair
of
the
season
said
i
i
call
that
genius
of
a
pretty
high
order
i
would
pity
them
if
i
were
you
they
happy
innitt
though
i
envy
her
said
henriette
that
is
in
a
way
she
has
no
conversation
at
all
but
her
little
dinners
are
the
swellest
things
of
the
season
never
more
than
ten
people
at
a
time
and
everything
cooked
to
a
turn
that
just
it
said
i
i
hear
enough
at
the
club
to
know
just
what
cinches
innitt
position
it
her
cook
that
what
does
it
if
she
lost
her
cook
she
be
outofit
there
never
were
such
pancakes
such
purées
such
made
dishes
as
that
woman
gets
up
she
turns
hash
into
a
confection
and
liver
and
bacon
into
a
delicacy
in
her
hands
is
a
discovery
and
her
sauces
are
such
that
a
bit
of
roast
rhinoceros
hide
tastes
like
the
tenderest
of
squab
when
served
by
her
no
wonder
innitt
holds
her
own
a
woman
with
a
cook
like
norah
sullivan
could
rule
an
empire
a
moment
later
i
was
sorry
i
had
spoken
for
my
words
electrified
her
must
have
her
cried
henriette
what
mrs
innitt
i
asked
no
her
cook
said
henriette
i
stood
aghast
full
of
sympathy
as
i
had
always
been
with
the
projects
of
van
raffles
and
never
in
the
least
objecting
on
moral
grounds
to
any
of
her
schemes
of
acquisition
i
could
not
but
think
that
this
time
she
proposed
to
go
too
far
to
rob
a
millionaire
of
his
bonds
a
national
bank
of
its
surplus
a
philanthropist
of
a
library
or
a
metropolitan
boxholder
of
a
diamond
stomacher
all
that
seemed
reasonable
to
me
and
proper
according
to
my
way
of
looking
at
it
but
to
rob
a
neighbor
of
her
cook
if
there
is
any
worse
social
crime
than
that
i
do
know
what
it
is
you
better
think
twice
on
that
proposition
henriette
i
advised
with
a
gloomy
shake
of
the
head
it
is
not
only
a
mean
crime
but
a
dangerous
one
to
boot
success
would
in
itself
bring
ruin
innitt
would
never
forgive
you
and
society
at
large
society
at
large
would
dine
with
me
instead
of
with
innitt
all
said
henriette
i
mean
to
have
her
before
the
season
over
well
i
draw
the
line
at
stealing
a
cook
said
i
coldly
i
robbed
churches
and
i
made
way
with
funds
and
i
helped
you
in
many
another
legitimate
scheme
but
in
this
van
raffles
have
to
go
it
alone
oh
do
you
be
afraid
bunny
she
answered
i
not
going
to
use
your
charms
as
a
bait
to
lure
this
culinary
phyllis
into
the
arcadia
in
which
you
with
your
strephonlike
form
disport
yourself
you
ought
to
do
it
at
all
said
i
gruffly
it
worse
than
murder
for
it
is
prohibited
twice
in
the
decalogue
while
murder
is
only
mentioned
once
what
cried
henrietta
what
pray
does
the
decalogue
say
about
cooks
i
like
to
know
first
thou
shalt
not
steal
you
propose
to
steal
this
woman
second
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbor
how
many
times
does
that
make
i
asked
dear
me
bunny
said
henriette
but
you
a
little
tuppenny
puritan
are
you
anybody
know
you
were
the
son
of
a
clergyman
well
let
me
tell
you
i
steal
the
woman
and
i
covet
her
i
just
going
to
get
her
that
all
it
was
two
weeks
later
that
norah
sullivan
left
the
employ
of
innitt
and
was
installed
in
our
kitchen
and
strange
to
relate
she
came
as
a
matter
of
charity
on
henriette
part
having
been
discharged
by
innitt
the
friday
before
norah
arrival
henriette
requested
me
to
get
her
a
rusty
nail
a
piece
of
gravel
from
the
drive
two
and
a
steel
nut
from
the
automobile
what
on
earth
i
began
but
she
shut
me
off
with
an
imperious
gesture
do
as
i
tell
you
she
commanded
you
are
not
in
on
this
venture
and
then
apparently
she
relented
but
i
willing
to
tell
you
just
one
thing
bunny
here
her
eyes
began
to
twinkle
joyously
i
going
to
innitt
to
dinner
night
so
look
out
for
norah
by
monday
i
turned
sulkily
away
you
know
how
i
feel
on
that
subject
said
i
this
business
of
going
into
another
person
house
as
a
guest
and
inducing
their
servants
to
leave
is
an
infraction
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
how
would
you
like
it
if
gaster
stole
me
away
from
you
henriette
answer
was
a
puzzling
smile
you
are
free
to
better
your
condition
bunny
she
said
but
i
am
not
going
to
rob
innitt
as
i
told
you
once
before
she
will
discharge
norah
and
i
will
take
her
that
all
so
do
be
a
good
boy
and
bring
me
the
nail
and
gravel
and
the
and
the
automobile
nut
i
secured
the
desired
articles
for
my
mistress
and
the
next
evening
she
went
to
innitt
little
dinner
to
miss
gullet
and
her
fiancé
lord
dullpate
eldest
son
of
the
duke
of
lackshingles
who
had
come
over
to
america
to
avoid
the
scrutiny
of
the
bankruptcy
court
taking
the
absurd
objects
with
her
upon
her
return
at
she
was
radiant
and
triumphant
i
won
out
bunny
i
won
out
she
cried
how
i
inquired
innitt
has
discharged
norah
though
i
begged
her
not
to
she
fairly
sang
on
what
grounds
several
said
henriette
unfastening
her
glove
to
begin
with
there
was
a
rusty
nail
in
my
clam
cocktail
and
it
nearly
choked
me
to
death
i
tried
hard
to
keep
innitt
from
seeing
what
had
happened
but
she
is
watchful
if
not
brainy
and
all
my
efforts
went
for
naught
she
was
much
mortified
of
course
and
apologized
profusely
all
went
well
until
the
fish
when
one
of
the
two
turned
up
in
the
pompano
to
the
supreme
disgust
of
my
hostess
who
was
now
beginning
to
look
worried
number
two
made
its
début
in
my
timbale
this
was
too
much
for
the
watchful
innitt
though
she
always
is
and
despite
my
remonstrances
she
excused
herself
from
the
table
for
a
moment
and
i
judge
from
the
flushed
appearance
of
her
cheeks
when
she
returned
five
minutes
later
that
somebody
had
had
the
riot
act
read
to
her
somewhere
do
understand
it
at
all
van
raffles
she
said
with
a
sheepish
smile
perfectly
sober
if
anything
of
the
kind
ever
happens
again
she
shall
go
even
as
innitt
spoke
i
conveyed
a
luscious
morsel
of
filet
mignon
with
mushrooms
to
my
mouth
and
nearly
broke
my
tooth
on
a
piece
of
gravel
that
went
with
it
and
norah
was
doomed
for
although
we
all
laughed
heartily
the
thing
had
come
to
be
such
a
joke
it
was
plain
from
the
expression
of
innitt
countenance
that
she
was
very
very
angry
her
this
time
for
my
sake
innitt
i
pleaded
all
it
is
the
little
surprises
that
give
zest
to
life
and
you
did
have
to
use
the
automobile
nut
i
asked
deeply
impressed
with
the
woman
ingenuity
oh
yes
said
henriette
as
dinner
progressed
i
thought
it
wise
to
use
it
to
keep
innitt
from
weakening
so
when
the
salad
was
passed
i
managed
without
anybody
observing
it
to
drop
the
automobile
nut
into
the
bowl
the
duke
of
snarleyow
got
it
and
the
climax
was
capped
innitt
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
well
bunny
norah
leaves
you
will
take
her
this
bill
from
me
and
tell
her
that
i
am
sorry
she
got
into
so
much
trouble
on
my
account
say
that
if
i
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
her
all
she
has
to
do
is
to
call
here
and
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
get
her
another
place
illustration
on
her
way
to
barly
church
i
waylaid
norah
with
this
henriette
retired
and
the
next
morning
on
her
way
to
early
church
i
waylaid
norah
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
but
a
more
indignant
woman
never
lived
her
discharge
was
unrighteous
innitt
was
no
lady
the
butler
was
in
a
conspiracy
to
ruin
her
and
all
that
indeed
her
mood
was
most
receptive
to
the
furtherance
of
plans
the
bill
was
soothing
and
indicated
that
my
mistress
was
a
foine
woman
and
surely
norah
would
come
in
the
evening
to
ask
her
aid
it
ruined
i
am
unless
somebody
be
good
to
me
and
give
me
a
riference
which
innitt
bad
cess
to
her
wo
do
at
all
at
all
she
wailed
and
then
i
left
her
she
called
that
night
and
two
days
later
was
installed
in
the
van
raffles
kitchen
a
new
treasure
was
added
to
the
stores
of
our
loot
but
somehow
or
other
i
have
never
been
happy
over
the
successful
issue
of
the
enterprise
i
ca
quite
make
up
my
mind
that
it
was
a
thing
for
henriette
to
do
even
in
newport
xii
the
last
adventure
i
am
bathed
in
tears
i
have
tried
to
write
of
my
sensations
to
tell
the
story
of
the
last
adventure
of
van
raffles
in
lucid
terms
but
though
my
pen
runs
fast
over
the
paper
the
ink
makes
no
record
of
the
facts
my
woe
is
so
great
and
so
deep
that
my
tears
falling
into
the
turn
it
into
a
fluid
so
thin
it
will
not
mark
the
paper
and
when
i
try
the
pencil
the
words
are
scarce
put
down
before
they
blotted
out
and
yet
with
all
this
woe
i
find
myself
a
possessed
of
sums
so
far
beyond
my
wildest
dreams
of
fortune
that
my
eye
can
scarce
take
in
the
breadth
of
all
the
figures
my
dollars
coined
into
silver
placed
on
top
of
one
another
would
form
a
bullion
tower
that
would
reach
higher
into
the
air
than
fifteen
superimposed
domes
of
peter
placed
on
top
of
seventeen
spires
of
trinity
on
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
in
notes
laid
side
by
side
they
suffice
to
paper
every
scrap
of
bedroom
wall
in
all
the
astor
houses
in
the
world
and
invested
in
amalgamated
copper
they
would
turn
the
system
green
with
envy
and
yet
i
am
not
happy
my
henriette
last
adventure
has
turned
my
fortune
into
bitterest
gall
and
plain
unvarnished
wormwood
forms
the
finish
of
my
interior
for
she
is
gone
i
amid
the
splendor
of
my
possessions
able
to
keep
not
one
but
a
hundred
and
to
pay
the
chauffeur
fines
to
endow
chairs
in
universities
to
build
libraries
in
every
hamlet
in
the
land
from
podunk
to
richard
mansfield
to
eat
three
meals
a
day
and
lodge
at
the
regicide
and
to
evade
my
taxes
without
exciting
suspicion
am
desolate
and
forlorn
for
i
repeat
henriette
has
gone
the
very
nature
of
her
last
adventure
by
a
successful
issue
has
blown
out
the
light
of
my
life
has
stolen
if
i
could
be
light
of
heart
in
this
tragic
hour
i
would
call
this
story
the
adventure
of
the
lifted
fiancé
but
that
would
be
so
out
of
key
with
my
emotions
that
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
do
it
i
must
content
myself
with
a
narration
of
the
simple
facts
of
the
lengths
to
which
my
beloved
ambition
led
her
without
frivolity
and
with
a
heavy
heart
of
course
you
know
what
all
newport
has
known
for
months
that
the
were
seeking
divorce
not
that
they
loved
one
another
less
but
that
both
parties
to
the
south
dakota
suit
loved
some
one
else
more
colonel
scrappe
had
long
been
the
most
ardent
admirer
of
and
devotion
to
young
harry
de
lakwitz
had
been
at
least
for
two
seasons
evident
to
any
observer
with
half
an
eye
had
considerately
taken
himself
out
of
the
way
by
eloping
to
south
africa
with
tottie
dimpleton
of
the
frivolity
burlesquers
and
harry
de
lakwitz
only
recorded
marriage
had
been
annulled
by
the
courts
because
at
the
time
of
his
wedding
to
the
housemaid
of
the
belleville
for
boys
at
skidgeway
rhode
island
he
was
only
fifteen
years
of
age
consequently
they
both
were
eligible
and
provided
the
could
be
so
operated
on
by
the
laws
of
south
dakota
as
to
free
them
from
one
another
there
were
no
valid
reasons
why
the
yearnings
of
these
ardent
souls
should
not
all
be
gratified
indeed
both
engagements
had
been
announced
tentatively
and
only
the
signing
of
the
decree
releasing
the
from
their
obligations
to
one
another
now
stood
in
the
way
of
two
nuptial
ceremonies
which
would
make
four
hearts
beat
as
one
trousseau
was
ready
and
that
of
the
future
de
lakwitz
had
been
ordered
both
ladies
had
received
their
engagement
rings
when
that
inscrutable
henriette
marked
for
her
own
colonel
scrappe
had
returned
from
monte
carlo
having
broken
the
bank
twice
and
henriette
had
met
him
at
a
little
dinner
given
in
his
honor
by
he
turned
out
to
be
a
most
charming
man
and
it
did
require
a
much
more
keen
perception
than
my
own
to
take
in
the
fact
that
he
had
made
a
great
impression
upon
henriette
though
she
never
mentioned
it
to
me
until
the
final
blow
came
i
merely
noticed
a
growing
preoccupation
in
her
manner
and
in
her
attitude
towards
me
which
changed
perceptibly
i
think
bunny
she
said
to
me
one
morning
as
i
brought
her
marmalade
and
toast
that
considering
our
relations
to
each
other
you
should
not
call
me
henrietta
after
all
you
know
you
are
here
primarily
as
my
butler
and
there
are
some
proprieties
that
should
be
observed
even
in
this
newport
atmosphere
but
i
protested
am
i
no
more
than
that
i
am
your
partner
am
i
not
you
are
my
business
partner
not
my
social
bunny
she
said
we
must
not
mix
society
and
business
in
this
house
i
am
mistress
of
the
situation
you
are
the
butler
that
is
the
precise
condition
and
i
think
it
well
that
hereafter
you
should
recognize
the
real
truth
and
avoid
by
addressing
me
as
van
raffles
if
we
should
ever
open
an
office
for
our
burglary
company
in
new
york
or
elsewhere
you
may
call
me
anything
you
please
there
here
however
you
must
be
governed
by
the
etiquette
of
your
environment
let
it
be
van
raffles
hereafter
and
is
it
to
be
mr
bunny
i
inquired
sarcastically
her
response
was
a
cold
glance
of
the
eye
and
a
majestic
sweep
from
the
room
illustration
henriette
was
testing
the
piano
that
evening
colonel
scrappe
called
ostensibly
to
look
over
the
house
and
as
landlord
to
see
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
to
make
it
more
comfortable
and
i
blind
fool
that
i
was
for
the
moment
believed
that
that
was
his
real
errand
and
ventured
to
remind
henriette
of
the
leak
in
the
roof
at
which
they
both
i
thought
exchanged
amused
glances
and
gravely
mounted
the
stairs
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
look
at
it
on
our
return
henriette
dismissed
me
and
told
me
that
she
would
not
require
my
services
again
during
the
evening
even
then
my
suspicions
were
not
aroused
although
there
was
a
dull
disturbed
feeling
about
my
heart
whose
precise
causes
i
could
not
define
i
went
to
the
club
and
put
in
a
miserable
evening
returning
home
about
midnight
to
discover
that
colonel
scrappe
was
still
there
he
was
apparently
giving
the
house
and
its
contents
a
thorough
inspection
for
when
i
arrived
henriette
was
testing
the
piano
in
the
for
him
with
a
brilliant
rendering
of
o
promise
me
what
decision
they
reached
as
to
its
tone
and
quality
i
never
knew
for
in
spite
of
my
hints
on
the
subject
henriette
never
spoke
of
the
matter
to
me
i
suppose
i
should
have
begun
to
guess
what
was
happening
under
my
very
nose
then
but
thank
heaven
i
am
not
of
a
suspicious
nature
and
although
i
did
like
the
looks
of
things
the
inevitable
meaning
of
their
strange
behavior
never
even
dawned
upon
my
mind
even
when
two
nights
later
colonel
scrappe
escorted
henriette
home
at
midnight
from
a
lecture
on
the
inscrutability
of
sartor
resartus
at
it
did
not
strike
me
as
unusual
although
instead
of
going
home
immediately
as
most
escorts
do
under
the
circumstances
he
remained
about
two
hours
testing
that
infernal
piano
again
and
with
the
same
old
tune
then
the
automobile
rides
began
and
pretty
nearly
every
morning
long
before
polite
society
was
awake
colonel
scrappe
and
henriette
took
long
runs
together
through
the
country
in
her
mercedes
machine
for
what
purpose
i
snever
knew
for
whatever
interest
the
colonel
might
have
had
in
our
welfare
as
a
landlord
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
guess
how
it
could
be
extended
to
our
automobiles
one
thing
i
did
notice
however
was
a
growing
coldness
between
henriette
and
the
latter
came
to
a
at
bolivar
lodge
one
afternoon
about
two
weeks
after
colonel
scrappe
return
and
her
greeting
to
her
hostess
instead
of
having
the
effusiveness
was
frigid
to
a
degree
in
fact
when
they
clasped
hands
i
doubt
if
more
than
the
tips
of
their
fingers
touched
moreover
hitherto
considered
one
of
the
best
fists
at
bridge
or
hearts
in
the
actually
won
the
booby
prize
which
i
saw
her
throw
into
the
street
when
she
departed
it
was
evident
something
had
happened
to
disturb
her
equanimity
my
eyes
were
finally
opened
by
a
remark
made
at
the
club
by
digby
reggie
de
pelt
valet
who
asked
me
how
i
liked
my
new
boss
and
whose
explanation
of
the
question
led
to
a
complete
revelation
of
the
true
facts
in
the
case
everybody
knew
he
said
that
from
the
moment
she
had
met
him
van
raffles
had
set
her
cap
for
colonel
scrappe
and
that
meeting
her
for
the
first
time
he
had
fallen
head
over
heels
in
love
with
her
even
in
the
presence
of
his
fiancée
of
course
i
hotly
denied
digby
insinuations
and
we
got
so
warm
over
the
discussion
that
when
i
returned
home
that
night
i
had
two
badly
discolored
eyes
and
digby
well
digby
did
go
home
at
all
both
of
us
were
suspended
from
the
gentleman
gentleman
club
for
four
weeks
for
ungentlemanly
behavior
in
consequence
black
as
my
eyes
were
however
i
was
on
hand
at
the
the
following
morning
and
of
course
henriette
observed
my
injuries
why
bunny
she
cried
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
have
you
been
fighting
oh
no
van
raffles
i
returned
sarcastically
i
just
strained
my
eyes
reading
the
divorce
news
from
south
dakota
she
gave
a
sudden
start
what
do
you
mean
she
demanded
her
face
flushing
hotly
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
i
retorted
angrily
your
goings
on
with
colonel
scrappe
are
the
talk
of
the
town
and
i
got
these
eyes
in
a
little
discussion
of
your
matrimonial
intentions
that
all
leave
the
room
instantly
she
cried
rising
and
haughtily
pointing
to
the
door
you
are
insufferable
but
the
color
in
her
cheeks
showed
that
i
had
hit
home
far
harder
than
she
was
willing
to
admit
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
to
obey
meekly
but
my
blood
was
up
and
instead
of
moping
in
my
room
i
started
out
to
see
if
i
could
find
my
love
for
henriette
was
too
deep
to
permit
of
my
sitting
quietly
by
and
seeing
another
walk
away
with
the
one
truly
coveted
prize
of
my
life
and
i
was
ready
on
sight
to
take
the
colonel
by
the
collar
he
was
only
a
colonel
anyhow
and
consequently
no
great
shakes
as
a
fighter
and
throw
him
into
the
harbor
but
my
quest
was
a
vain
one
he
was
to
be
found
in
none
of
his
familiar
haunts
and
i
returned
to
bolivar
lodge
and
then
came
the
shock
as
i
approached
the
house
i
saw
the
colonel
assisting
henriette
into
the
and
in
response
to
the
chauffeur
where
to
sir
i
heard
scrappe
reply
in
an
excited
undertone
to
new
york
and
damn
the
speed
laws
in
a
moment
they
had
rushed
by
me
like
the
flash
of
a
lightning
express
and
henriette
was
gone
you
must
know
the
rest
the
papers
the
next
day
were
full
of
the
elopement
in
high
life
they
told
how
the
scrappe
divorce
had
been
granted
at
five
in
the
afternoon
the
day
before
how
colonel
scrappe
and
van
raffles
had
sped
to
new
york
in
the
automobile
and
been
quietly
married
at
the
little
church
around
the
corner
and
were
now
sailing
down
the
bay
on
the
bound
for
foreign
climes
they
likewise
intimated
that
a
very
attractive
lady
of
more
than
usual
effusiveness
of
manner
whose
nuptials
were
expected
soon
to
be
published
for
the
second
time
had
gone
to
a
sanitarium
in
philadelphia
to
be
treated
for
a
sudden
and
overwhelming
attack
of
nervous
hysteria
it
was
all
too
true
that
tale
henriette
final
coup
had
been
successful
and
she
had
at
one
stroke
stolen
her
landlord
her
landlady
husband
and
her
neighbor
fiancé
to
console
me
she
left
this
note
written
on
board
of
the
steamer
and
mailed
by
the
pilot
on
board
the
hydrostatic
off
sandy
hook
dear
bunny
i
could
help
it
the
minute
i
saw
him
i
felt
that
i
must
have
him
it
the
most
successful
haul
yet
and
is
the
last
adventure
i
shall
ever
have
he
worth
forty
million
dollars
i
sorry
for
you
dear
but
it
all
in
the
line
of
business
to
console
you
i
have
left
in
your
name
all
that
we
have
won
together
in
our
partnership
at
newport
fourteen
millions
five
hundred
and
thousand
nine
hundred
and
dollars
in
cash
and
about
three
million
dollars
in
jewels
which
you
must
negotiate
carefully
dear
bunny
i
shall
never
forget
you
and
i
wish
you
all
the
happiness
in
the
world
with
the
funds
now
in
your
possession
why
not
retire
go
home
to
england
and
renew
your
studies
for
the
ministry
the
church
is
a
noble
profession
sincerely
yours
henriette
van
i
have
gathered
together
these
meagre
possessions
rich
in
bullion
value
but
meagre
in
happiness
considering
all
that
might
have
been
and
i
sail
for
london
there
following
henriette
advice
i
shall
enter
the
study
of
the
ministry
and
when
i
am
ordained
shall
buy
a
living
somewhere
and
settle
down
to
the
serene
existence
of
the
preacher
the
pastor
of
a
flock
of
human
sheep
illustration
my
misery
is
deep
but
i
am
buoyed
up
by
one
great
hope
my
misery
is
deep
but
i
am
buoyed
up
by
one
great
hope
in
every
thought
these
newport
marriages
are
so
seldom
for
life
that
i
yet
have
hope
that
some
day
henriette
will
be
restored
to
me
without
its
necessarily
involving
any
serious
accident
to
her
husband
the
colonel
