danny
popped
his
head
out
of
another
little
doorway
and
laughed
at
reddy
he
was
being
carried
peter
knew
that
danny
was
doing
something
at
the
other
end
with
another
frightened
squeak
danny
dived
into
the
opening
just
in
time
the
adventures
of
danny
meadow
mouse
i
danny
meadow
mouse
is
worried
danny
meadow
mouse
sat
on
his
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
and
it
was
very
plain
to
see
that
danny
had
something
on
his
mind
he
had
only
a
nod
for
jimmy
skunk
and
even
peter
rabbit
could
get
no
more
than
a
grumpy
good
it
wasn
t
that
he
had
been
caught
napping
the
day
before
by
reddy
fox
and
nearly
made
an
end
of
no
it
wasn
t
that
danny
had
learned
his
lesson
and
reddy
would
never
catch
him
again
it
wasn
t
that
he
was
all
alone
with
no
one
to
play
with
danny
was
rather
glad
that
he
was
alone
the
fact
is
danny
meadow
mouse
was
worried
now
worry
is
one
of
the
worst
things
in
the
world
and
it
didn
t
seem
as
if
there
was
anything
that
danny
meadow
mouse
need
worry
about
but
you
know
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
find
something
to
worry
over
and
make
yourself
uncomfortable
about
and
when
you
make
yourself
uncomfortable
you
are
almost
sure
to
make
every
one
around
you
equally
uncomfortable
it
was
so
with
danny
meadow
mouse
striped
chipmunk
had
twice
called
him
cross
patch
that
morning
and
johnny
chuck
who
had
fought
reddy
fox
for
him
the
day
before
had
called
him
and
what
do
you
think
was
the
matter
with
danny
meadow
mouse
why
he
was
worrying
because
his
tail
is
short
yes
sir
that
is
all
that
ailed
danny
meadow
mouse
that
bright
morning
you
know
some
people
let
their
looks
make
them
miserable
they
worry
because
they
are
homely
or
freckled
or
short
or
tall
or
thin
or
stout
all
of
which
is
very
foolish
and
danny
meadow
mouse
was
just
as
foolish
in
worrying
because
his
tail
is
short
it
is
short
it
certainly
is
all
of
that
danny
never
had
realized
how
short
until
he
chanced
to
meet
his
cousin
whitefoot
who
lives
in
the
green
forest
he
was
very
elegantly
dressed
but
the
most
imposing
thing
about
him
was
his
long
slim
beautiful
tail
danny
had
at
once
become
conscious
of
his
own
stubby
little
tail
and
he
had
hardly
had
pride
enough
to
hold
his
head
up
as
became
an
honest
meadow
mouse
ever
since
he
had
been
thinking
and
thinking
and
wondering
how
his
family
came
to
have
such
short
tails
then
he
grew
envious
and
began
to
wish
and
wish
and
wish
that
he
could
have
a
long
tail
like
his
cousin
whitefoot
he
was
so
busy
wishing
that
he
had
a
long
tail
that
he
quite
forgot
to
take
care
of
the
tail
he
did
have
and
he
pretty
nearly
lost
it
and
his
life
with
it
old
whitetail
the
marsh
hawk
spied
danny
sitting
there
moping
on
his
and
came
sailing
over
the
tops
of
the
meadow
grasses
so
softly
that
he
all
but
caught
danny
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
one
of
the
merry
little
breezes
danny
would
have
been
caught
and
all
because
he
was
envious
it
s
a
bad
bad
habit
ii
danny
meadow
mouse
and
his
short
tail
all
danny
meadow
mouse
could
think
about
was
his
short
tail
he
was
so
ashamed
of
it
that
whenever
any
one
passed
he
crawled
out
of
sight
so
that
they
should
not
see
how
short
his
tail
is
instead
of
playing
in
the
sunshine
as
he
used
to
do
he
sat
and
sulked
pretty
soon
his
friends
began
to
pass
without
stopping
finally
one
day
old
toad
sat
down
in
front
of
danny
and
began
to
ask
questions
what
s
the
matter
asked
old
toad
nothing
replied
danny
meadow
mouse

got
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
haven
t
you
continued
toad
i
don
t
suppose
that
there
really
is
anything
the
matter
but
what
do
you
think
is
the
matter
said
old
toad
danny
fidgeted
and
old
toad
looked
up
at
jolly
round
red
sun
and
winked
sun
is
just
as
bright
as
ever
isn
t
it
he
inquired
yes
said
danny
got
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
haven
t
you
continued
toad
yes
said
danny
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
pretty
good
looking
suit
of
clothes
you
re
wearing
said
toad
eyeing
danny
critically
sunny
weather
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
and
good
be
you
don
t
know
when
you
re
well
off
danny
meadow
danny
hung
his
head
finally
he
looked
up
and
caught
a
kindly
twinkle
in
old
toad
s
eyes
mr
toad
how
can
i
get
a
long
tail
like
my
cousin
whitefoot
of
the
green
forest
he
asked
so
that
s
what
s
the
matter
ha
ha
ha
danny
meadow
mouse
i
m
ashamed
of
you
i
certainly
am
ashamed
of
you
said
toad
what
good
would
a
long
tail
do
you
tell
me
for
a
minute
danny
didn
t
know
just
what
to
say
d
look
so
much
better
if
i
had
a
long
tail
he
ventured
old
toad
just
laughed
you
never
saw
a
meadow
mouse
with
a
long
tail
did
you
of
course
not
what
a
sight
it
would
be
why
everybody
on
the
green
meadows
would
laugh
themselves
sick
at
the
sight
you
see
you
need
to
be
slim
and
trim
and
handsome
to
carry
a
long
tail
well
and
then
what
a
nuisance
it
would
be
you
would
always
have
to
be
thinking
of
your
tail
and
taking
care
to
keep
it
out
of
harm
s
way
look
at
me
i
m
homely
some
folks
call
me
ugly
to
look
at
but
no
one
tries
to
catch
me
as
farmer
brown
s
boy
does
billy
mink
because
of
his
fine
coat
and
no
one
wants
to
put
me
in
a
cage
because
of
a
fine
voice
i
am
satisfied
to
be
just
as
i
am
and
if
you
ll
take
my
advice
danny
meadow
mouse
you
ll
be
satisfied
to
be
just
as
you
perhaps
you
are
right
said
danny
meadow
mouse
after
a
little
i
ll
iii
danny
meadow
mouse
plays
hide
and
seek
life
is
always
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
to
danny
meadow
mouse
you
see
he
is
such
a
fat
little
fellow
that
there
are
a
great
many
other
people
and
almost
as
many
who
wear
feathers
who
would
gobble
danny
up
for
breakfast
or
for
dinner
if
they
could
some
of
them
pretend
to
be
his
friends
but
danny
always
keeps
his
eyes
open
when
they
are
around
and
always
begins
to
play
hide
and
seek
peter
rabbit
and
jimmy
skunk
and
striped
chipmunk
and
happy
jack
squirrel
are
all
friends
whom
he
can
trust
but
he
always
has
a
bright
twinkling
eye
open
for
reddy
fox
and
billy
mink
and
shadow
the
weasel
and
old
whitetail
the
marsh
hawk
and
several
more
especially
hooty
the
owl
at
night
now
danny
meadow
mouse
is
a
little
fellow
and
when
rough
brother
north
wind
came
shouting
across
the
green
meadows
tearing
to
pieces
the
snow
clouds
and
shaking
out
the
snowflakes
until
they
covered
the
green
meadows
deep
deep
deep
danny
just
snuggled
down
in
his
warm
coat
in
his
snug
little
house
of
grass
and
waited
danny
liked
the
snow
yes
sir
danny
meadow
mouse
liked
the
snow
he
just
loved
to
dig
in
it
and
make
tunnels
through
those
tunnels
in
every
direction
he
could
go
where
he
pleased
and
when
he
pleased
without
being
seen
by
anybody
it
was
great
fun
every
little
way
he
made
a
little
round
doorway
up
beside
a
stiff
stalk
of
grass
out
of
this
he
could
peep
at
the
white
world
and
he
could
get
the
fresh
cold
air
sometimes
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
no
one
was
around
he
would
scamper
across
on
top
of
the
snow
from
one
doorway
to
another
and
when
he
did
this
he
made
the
prettiest
little
footprints
now
reddy
fox
knew
all
about
those
doorways
and
who
made
them
reddy
was
having
hard
work
to
get
enough
to
eat
this
cold
weather
and
he
was
hungry
most
of
the
time
one
morning
as
he
came
tiptoeing
softly
over
the
meadows
what
should
he
see
just
ahead
of
him
but
the
head
of
danny
meadow
mouse
pop
out
of
one
of
those
little
round
doorways
reddy
s
mouth
watered
and
he
stole
forward
more
softly
than
ever
when
he
got
within
jumping
distance
he
drew
his
stout
hind
legs
under
him
and
made
ready
to
spring
presto
danny
meadow
mouse
had
disappeared
reddy
fox
jumped
just
the
same
and
began
to
dig
as
fast
as
he
could
make
his
paws
go
he
could
smell
danny
meadow
mouse
and
that
made
him
almost
frantic
illustration
danny
popped
his
head
out
of
another
little
doorway
and
laughed
at
reddy
all
the
time
danny
meadow
mouse
was
scurrying
along
one
of
his
little
tunnels
and
when
finally
reddy
fox
stopped
digging
because
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
danny
popped
his
head
out
of
another
little
doorway
and
laughed
at
reddy
of
course
reddy
saw
him
and
of
course
reddy
tried
to
catch
him
there
and
dug
frantically
just
as
before
and
of
course
danny
meadow
mouse
wasn
t
there
after
a
while
reddy
fox
grew
tired
of
this
kind
of
a
game
and
tried
another
plan
the
next
time
he
saw
danny
meadow
mouse
stick
his
head
out
reddy
pretended
not
to
see
him
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
ground
and
made
believe
that
he
was
very
tired
and
sleepy
he
closed
his
eyes
then
he
opened
them
just
the
tiniest
bit
so
that
he
could
see
danny
meadow
mouse
and
yet
seem
to
be
asleep
danny
watched
him
for
a
long
time
then
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
dropped
out
of
sight
no
sooner
was
he
gone
than
reddy
fox
stole
over
close
to
the
little
doorway
and
waited
he
ll
surely
stick
his
head
out
again
to
see
if
i
m
asleep
and
then
i
ll
have
him
said
reddy
to
himself
so
he
waited
and
waited
and
waited
by
and
by
he
turned
his
head
there
was
danny
meadow
mouse
at
another
little
doorway
laughing
at
him
iv
old
granny
fox
tries
for
danny
meadow
mouse
danny
meadow
mouse
had
not
enjoyed
anything
so
much
for
a
long
time
as
he
did
that
game
of
hide
and
seek
he
tickled
and
chuckled
all
the
afternoon
as
he
thought
about
it
of
course
reddy
had
been
he
had
been
it
all
the
time
for
never
once
had
he
caught
danny
meadow
mouse
if
he
there
wouldn
t
have
been
any
more
stories
about
danny
meadow
mouse
because
there
wouldn
t
have
been
any
danny
meadow
mouse
any
more
but
danny
never
let
himself
think
about
this
he
had
enjoyed
the
game
all
the
more
because
it
had
been
such
a
dangerous
game
it
had
been
such
fun
to
dive
into
one
of
his
little
round
doorways
in
the
snow
run
along
one
of
his
own
little
tunnels
and
then
peep
out
at
another
doorway
and
watch
reddy
fox
digging
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
at
the
doorway
danny
had
just
left
finally
reddy
had
given
up
in
disgust
and
gone
off
muttering
angrily
to
try
to
find
something
else
for
dinner
danny
had
sat
up
on
the
snow
and
watched
him
go
in
his
funny
little
squeaky
voice
danny
shouted
though
reddy
fox
is
smart
and
sly
i
m
just
as
smart
and
twice
as
spry
that
night
reddy
fox
told
old
granny
fox
all
about
how
he
had
tried
to
catch
danny
meadow
mouse
granny
listened
with
her
head
cocked
on
one
side
when
reddy
told
how
fat
danny
meadow
mouse
was
her
mouth
watered
you
see
now
that
snow
covered
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
granny
and
reddy
fox
had
hard
work
to
get
enough
to
eat
and
they
were
hungry
most
of
the
time
i
ll
go
with
you
down
on
the
meadows
morning
and
then
we
ll
see
if
danny
meadow
mouse
is
as
smart
as
he
thinks
he
is
said
granny
fox
so
bright
and
early
the
next
morning
old
granny
fox
and
reddy
fox
went
down
on
the
meadows
where
danny
meadow
mouse
lives
danny
had
felt
in
his
bones
that
reddy
would
come
back
so
he
was
watching
and
he
saw
them
as
soon
as
they
came
out
of
the
green
forest
when
he
saw
old
granny
fox
danny
s
heart
beat
a
little
faster
than
before
for
he
knew
that
granny
fox
is
very
smart
and
very
wise
and
has
learned
most
of
the
tricks
of
all
the
other
little
meadow
and
forest
people
this
is
going
to
be
a
more
exciting
game
than
the
other
said
danny
to
himself
and
scurried
down
out
of
sight
to
see
that
all
his
little
tunnels
were
clear
so
that
he
could
run
fast
through
them
if
he
had
to
then
he
peeped
out
of
one
of
his
little
doorways
hidden
in
a
clump
of
tall
grass
old
granny
fox
set
reddy
to
hunting
for
danny
s
little
round
doorways
and
as
fast
as
he
found
them
granny
came
up
and
sniffed
at
each
she
knew
that
she
could
tell
by
the
smell
which
one
he
had
been
at
last
finally
she
came
straight
towards
the
tall
bunch
of
grass
danny
ducked
down
and
scurried
along
one
of
his
little
tunnels
he
heard
granny
fox
sniff
at
the
doorway
he
had
just
left
suddenly
something
plunged
down
through
the
snow
right
at
his
very
heels
danny
didn
t
have
to
look
to
know
that
it
was
granny
fox
herself
and
he
squeaked
with
fright
v
what
happened
on
the
green
meadows
thick
and
fast
things
were
happening
to
danny
meadow
mouse
down
on
the
green
meadows
rather
they
were
almost
happening
he
hadn
t
minded
when
reddy
fox
all
alone
tried
to
catch
him
indeed
he
had
made
a
regular
game
of
hide
and
seek
of
it
and
had
enjoyed
it
immensely
but
now
it
was
different
granny
fox
wasn
t
so
easily
fooled
as
reddy
fox
just
granny
alone
would
have
made
the
game
dangerous
for
danny
meadow
mouse
but
reddy
was
with
her
and
so
danny
had
two
to
look
out
for
and
he
got
so
many
frights
that
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
his
heart
had
moved
right
up
into
his
mouth
and
was
going
to
stay
there
yes
sir
that
is
just
how
it
seemed
down
in
his
little
tunnels
underneath
the
snow
danny
meadow
mouse
felt
perfectly
safe
from
reddy
fox
who
would
stop
and
dig
frantically
at
the
little
round
doorway
where
he
had
last
seen
danny
but
old
granny
fox
knew
all
about
those
little
tunnels
and
she
didn
t
waste
any
time
digging
at
the
doorways
instead
she
cocked
her
sharp
little
ears
and
listened
with
all
her
might
now
granny
fox
has
very
keen
ears
oh
very
keen
ears
and
she
heard
just
what
she
hoped
she
would
hear
she
heard
danny
meadow
mouse
running
along
one
of
his
little
tunnels
under
the
snow
plunge
old
granny
fox
dived
right
into
the
snow
and
right
through
into
the
tunnel
of
danny
meadow
mouse
her
two
black
paws
actually
touched
danny
s
tail
he
was
glad
then
that
it
was
no
longer
ha
cried
granny
fox
i
almost
got
him
that
time
then
she
ran
ahead
a
little
way
over
the
snow
listening
as
before
plunge
into
the
snow
she
went
again
it
was
lucky
for
him
that
danny
had
just
turned
into
another
tunnel
for
otherwise
she
would
surely
have
caught
him
granny
fox
blew
the
snow
out
of
her
nose
next
time
i
ll
get
him
said
she
now
reddy
fox
is
quick
to
learn
especially
when
it
is
a
way
to
get
something
to
eat
he
watched
granny
fox
and
when
he
understood
what
she
was
doing
he
made
up
his
mind
to
have
a
try
himself
for
he
was
afraid
that
if
she
caught
danny
meadow
mouse
she
would
think
that
he
was
not
big
enough
to
divide
perhaps
that
was
because
reddy
is
very
selfish
himself
so
the
next
time
granny
plunged
into
the
snow
and
missed
danny
meadow
mouse
just
as
before
reddy
rushed
in
ahead
of
her
and
the
minute
he
heard
danny
running
down
below
he
plunged
in
just
as
he
had
seen
granny
do
but
he
didn
t
take
the
pains
to
make
sure
of
just
where
danny
was
and
so
of
course
he
didn
t
come
anywhere
near
him
but
he
frightened
danny
still
more
and
made
old
granny
fox
lose
her
temper
poor
danny
meadow
mouse
he
had
never
been
so
frightened
in
all
his
life
he
didn
t
know
which
way
to
turn
or
where
to
run
and
so
he
sat
still
which
although
he
didn
t
know
it
was
the
very
best
thing
he
could
do
when
he
sat
still
he
made
no
noise
and
so
of
course
granny
and
reddy
fox
could
not
tell
where
he
was
old
granny
fox
sat
and
listened
and
listened
and
listened
and
wondered
where
danny
meadow
mouse
was
and
down
under
the
snow
danny
meadow
mouse
sat
and
listened
and
listened
and
listened
and
wondered
where
granny
and
reddy
fox
were
pooh
said
granny
fox
after
a
while
that
meadow
mouse
thinks
he
can
fool
me
by
sitting
still
i
ll
give
him
a
then
she
began
to
plunge
into
the
snow
this
way
and
that
way
and
sure
enough
pretty
soon
she
landed
so
close
to
danny
meadow
mouse
that
one
of
her
claws
scratched
him
vi
danny
meadow
mouse
remembers
and
reddy
fox
forgets
there
he
goes
cried
old
granny
fox
don
t
let
him
sit
still
again
i
hear
him
shouted
reddy
fox
and
plunged
down
into
the
snow
just
as
granny
fox
had
done
a
minute
before
but
he
didn
t
catch
anything
and
when
he
had
blown
the
snow
out
of
his
nose
and
wiped
it
out
of
his
eyes
he
saw
granny
fox
dive
into
the
snow
with
no
better
luck
never
mind
said
granny
fox
as
long
as
we
keep
him
running
we
can
hear
him
and
some
one
of
these
times
we
ll
catch
him
pretty
soon
he
ll
get
too
tired
to
be
so
spry
and
when
he
granny
didn
t
finish
but
licked
her
chops
and
smacked
her
lips
reddy
fox
grinned
then
licked
his
chops
and
smacked
his
lips
then
once
more
they
took
turns
diving
into
the
snow
and
down
underneath
in
the
little
tunnels
he
had
made
danny
meadow
mouse
was
running
for
his
life
he
was
getting
tired
just
as
old
granny
fox
had
said
he
would
he
was
almost
out
of
breath
he
was
sore
and
one
leg
smarted
for
in
one
of
her
jumps
old
granny
fox
had
so
nearly
caught
him
that
her
claws
had
torn
his
pants
and
scratched
him
oh
dear
oh
dear
if
only
i
had
time
to
think
panted
danny
meadow
mouse
and
then
he
squealed
in
still
greater
fright
as
reddy
fox
crashed
down
into
his
tunnel
right
at
his
very
heels
i
ve
got
to
get
somewhere
i
ve
got
to
get
somewhere
where
they
can
t
get
at
me
he
sobbed
and
right
that
very
instant
he
remembered
the
old
the
old
lay
on
the
ground
and
was
hollow
fastened
to
it
were
long
wires
with
sharp
cruel
barbs
danny
had
made
a
tunnel
over
to
that
old
the
very
first
day
after
the
snow
came
for
in
that
hollow
in
the
old
post
he
had
a
secret
store
of
seeds
why
hadn
t
he
thought
of
it
before
it
must
have
been
because
he
was
too
frightened
to
think
but
he
remembered
now
and
he
dodged
into
the
tunnel
that
led
to
the
old
running
faster
than
ever
for
though
his
heart
was
in
his
mouth
from
fear
in
his
heart
was
hope
and
hope
is
a
wonderful
thing
now
old
granny
fox
knew
all
about
that
old
and
she
remembered
all
about
those
barbed
wires
fastened
to
it
although
they
were
covered
with
snow
she
knew
just
about
where
they
lay
and
just
before
she
reached
them
she
stopped
plunging
down
into
the
snow
reddy
fox
knew
about
those
wires
too
but
he
was
so
excited
that
he
forgot
all
about
them
stop
cried
old
granny
fox
sharply
but
reddy
fox
didn
t
hear
or
if
he
heard
he
didn
t
heed
his
sharp
ears
could
hear
danny
meadow
mouse
running
almost
underneath
him
granny
fox
could
stop
if
she
wanted
to
but
he
was
going
to
have
danny
meadow
mouse
for
his
breakfast
down
into
the
snow
he
plunged
as
hard
as
ever
he
could
oh
oh
wow
wow
oh
dear
oh
dear
that
wasn
t
the
voice
of
danny
meadow
mouse
oh
my
no
it
was
the
voice
of
reddy
fox
yes
sir
it
was
the
voice
of
reddy
fox
he
had
landed
with
one
of
his
black
paws
right
on
one
of
those
sharp
wire
barbs
and
it
did
hurt
dreadfully
i
never
did
know
a
young
fox
who
could
get
into
so
much
trouble
as
you
can
snapped
old
granny
fox
as
reddy
hobbled
along
on
three
legs
behind
her
across
the
green
meadows
it
serves
you
right
for
forgetting
yes
m
said
reddy
meekly
and
safe
in
the
hollow
of
the
old
danny
meadow
mouse
was
dressing
the
scratch
on
his
leg
made
by
the
claws
of
old
granny
fox
vii
old
granny
fox
tries
a
new
plan
old
granny
fox
kept
thinking
about
danny
meadow
mouse
she
knew
that
he
was
fat
and
it
made
her
mouth
water
every
time
she
thought
of
him
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
must
and
would
have
him
she
knew
that
danny
had
been
very
very
much
frightened
when
she
and
reddy
fox
had
tried
so
hard
to
catch
him
by
plunging
down
through
the
snow
into
his
little
tunnels
after
him
and
she
felt
pretty
sure
that
he
wouldn
t
go
far
away
from
the
old
in
the
hollow
of
which
he
was
snug
and
safe
old
granny
fox
is
very
smart
danny
meadow
mouse
won
t
put
his
nose
out
of
that
old
for
a
day
or
two
then
he
ll
get
tired
of
staying
inside
all
the
time
and
he
ll
peep
out
of
one
of
his
little
round
doorways
to
see
if
the
way
is
clear
if
he
doesn
t
see
any
danger
he
ll
come
out
and
run
around
on
top
of
the
snow
to
get
some
of
the
seeds
in
the
tops
of
the
tall
grasses
that
stick
out
through
the
snow
if
nothing
frightens
him
he
ll
keep
going
a
little
farther
and
a
little
farther
from
that
old
i
must
see
to
it
that
danny
meadow
mouse
isn
t
frightened
for
a
few
so
said
old
granny
fox
to
herself
as
she
lay
under
a
studying
how
she
could
best
get
the
next
meal
then
she
called
reddy
fox
to
her
and
forbade
him
to
go
down
on
the
meadows
until
she
should
tell
him
he
might
reddy
grumbled
and
mumbled
and
didn
t
see
why
he
shouldn
t
go
where
he
pleased
but
he
didn
t
dare
disobey
you
see
he
had
a
sore
foot
he
had
hurt
it
on
a
wire
barb
when
he
was
plunging
through
the
snow
after
danny
meadow
mouse
and
now
he
had
to
run
on
three
legs
that
meant
that
he
must
depend
upon
granny
fox
to
help
him
get
enough
to
eat
so
reddy
didn
t
dare
to
disobey
it
all
came
out
just
as
granny
fox
had
thought
it
would
danny
meadow
mouse
get
tired
of
staying
in
the
old
he
peep
out
first
and
then
he
run
a
little
way
on
the
snow
and
then
a
little
farther
and
a
little
farther
but
all
the
time
he
took
great
care
not
to
get
more
than
a
jump
or
two
from
one
of
his
little
round
doorways
leading
down
to
his
tunnels
under
the
snow
hidden
on
the
edge
of
the
green
forest
granny
fox
watched
him
she
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
she
knew
that
it
was
going
to
snow
again
that
s
good
said
she
morning
i
ll
have
fat
meadow
mouse
for
breakfast
and
she
smiled
a
hungry
smile
the
next
morning
before
jolly
round
red
sun
was
out
of
bed
old
granny
fox
trotted
down
on
to
the
meadows
and
straight
over
to
where
down
under
the
snow
lay
the
old
it
had
snowed
again
and
all
of
the
little
doorways
of
danny
meadow
mouse
were
covered
up
with
soft
fleecy
snow
behind
granny
fox
limped
reddy
fox
grumbling
to
himself
when
they
reached
the
place
where
the
old
lay
buried
under
the
snow
old
granny
fox
stretched
out
as
flat
as
she
could
then
she
told
reddy
to
cover
her
up
with
the
new
soft
snow
reddy
did
as
he
was
told
but
all
the
time
he
grumbled
now
you
go
off
to
the
green
forest
and
keep
out
of
sight
said
granny
fox
by
and
by
i
ll
bring
you
some
meadow
mouse
for
your
breakfast
and
granny
fox
chuckled
to
think
how
smart
she
was
and
how
she
was
going
to
catch
danny
meadow
mouse
viii
brother
north
wind
proves
a
friend
danny
meadow
mouse
had
seen
nothing
of
old
granny
fox
or
reddy
fox
for
several
days
every
morning
the
first
thing
he
did
even
before
he
had
breakfast
was
to
climb
up
to
one
of
his
little
round
doorways
and
peep
out
over
the
beautiful
white
meadows
to
see
if
there
was
any
danger
near
but
every
time
he
did
this
danny
used
a
different
doorway
for
said
danny
to
himself
if
any
one
should
happen
just
happen
to
see
me
this
morning
they
might
be
waiting
just
outside
my
doorway
to
catch
me
you
see
there
is
a
great
deal
of
wisdom
in
the
little
head
that
danny
meadow
mouse
carries
on
his
shoulders
but
the
first
day
and
the
second
day
and
the
third
day
he
saw
nothing
of
old
granny
fox
or
of
reddy
fox
and
he
began
to
enjoy
running
through
his
tunnels
under
the
snow
and
scurrying
across
from
one
doorway
to
another
on
top
of
the
snow
just
as
he
had
before
the
foxes
had
tried
so
hard
to
catch
him
but
he
hadn
t
forgotten
as
granny
fox
had
hoped
he
would
no
indeed
danny
meadow
mouse
hadn
t
forgotten
he
was
too
wise
for
that
one
morning
when
he
started
to
climb
up
to
one
of
his
little
doorways
he
found
that
it
was
closed
yes
sir
it
was
closed
in
fact
there
wasn
t
any
doorway
more
snow
had
fallen
from
the
clouds
in
the
night
and
had
covered
up
every
one
of
the
little
round
doorways
of
danny
meadow
mouse
ha
said
danny
i
shall
have
a
busy
day
a
very
busy
day
opening
all
my
doorways
i
ll
eat
my
breakfast
and
then
i
ll
go
to
so
danny
meadow
mouse
ate
a
good
breakfast
of
seeds
which
he
had
stored
in
the
hollow
in
the
old
buried
under
the
snow
and
then
he
began
work
on
the
nearest
doorway
it
really
wasn
t
work
at
all
for
you
see
the
snow
was
soft
and
light
and
danny
dearly
loved
to
dig
in
it
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
made
a
wee
hole
through
which
he
could
peep
up
at
jolly
round
sun
in
a
few
minutes
more
he
had
made
it
big
enough
to
put
his
head
out
he
looked
this
way
and
he
looked
that
way
far
far
off
on
the
top
of
a
tree
he
could
see
old
roughleg
the
hawk
but
he
was
so
far
away
that
danny
didn
t
fear
him
at
all
i
don
t
see
anything
or
anybody
to
be
afraid
of
said
danny
and
poked
his
head
out
a
little
farther
then
he
sat
and
studied
everything
around
him
a
long
long
time
it
was
a
beautiful
white
world
a
very
beautiful
white
world
everything
was
so
white
and
pure
and
beautiful
that
it
didn
t
seem
possible
that
harm
or
danger
for
any
one
could
even
be
thought
of
but
danny
meadow
mouse
learned
long
ago
that
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
and
so
he
sat
with
just
his
little
head
sticking
out
of
his
doorway
and
studied
and
studied
just
a
little
way
off
was
a
little
heap
of
snow
i
don
t
remember
that
said
danny
and
i
don
t
remember
anything
that
would
make
that
there
isn
t
any
little
bush
or
old
log
or
anything
underneath
it
perhaps
rough
brother
north
wind
heaped
it
up
just
for
but
all
the
time
danny
meadow
mouse
kept
studying
and
studying
that
little
heap
of
snow
pretty
soon
he
saw
rough
brother
north
wind
coming
his
way
and
tossing
the
snow
about
as
he
came
he
caught
a
handful
from
the
top
of
the
little
heap
of
snow
that
danny
was
studying
and
when
he
had
passed
danny
s
sharp
eyes
saw
something
red
there
it
was
just
the
color
of
the
cloak
old
granny
fox
wears
granny
fox
you
can
t
fool
me
i
see
you
plain
as
plain
can
be
shouted
danny
meadow
mouse
and
dropped
down
out
of
sight
while
old
granny
fox
shook
the
snow
from
her
red
cloak
and
with
a
snarl
of
disappointment
and
anger
slowly
started
for
the
green
forest
where
reddy
fox
was
waiting
for
her
ix
danny
meadow
mouse
is
caught
at
last
play
and
frolic
in
the
snow
now
you
see
me
now
you
don
t
think
you
ll
catch
me
but
you
won
t
oh
such
fun
to
play
in
snow
danny
meadow
mouse
sang
this
or
at
least
he
tried
to
sing
it
as
he
skipped
about
on
the
snow
that
covered
the
green
meadows
but
danny
meadow
mouse
has
such
a
little
voice
such
a
funny
little
squeaky
voice
that
had
you
been
there
you
probably
would
never
have
guessed
that
he
was
singing
he
thought
he
was
though
and
was
enjoying
it
just
as
much
as
if
he
had
the
most
beautiful
voice
in
the
world
you
know
singing
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
happiness
in
the
heart
making
itself
heard
oh
yes
danny
meadow
mouse
was
happy
why
shouldn
t
he
have
been
hadn
t
he
proved
himself
smarter
than
old
granny
fox
that
is
something
to
make
any
one
happy
some
folks
may
fool
granny
fox
once
some
may
fool
her
twice
but
there
are
very
few
who
can
keep
right
on
fooling
her
until
she
gives
up
in
disgust
that
is
just
what
danny
meadow
mouse
had
done
and
he
felt
very
smart
and
of
course
he
felt
very
happy
so
danny
sang
his
little
song
and
skipped
about
in
the
moonlight
and
dodged
in
and
out
of
his
little
round
doorways
and
all
the
time
kept
his
sharp
little
eyes
open
for
any
sign
of
granny
fox
or
reddy
fox
but
with
all
his
smartness
danny
forgot
yes
sir
danny
forgot
one
thing
he
forgot
to
watch
up
in
the
sky
he
knew
that
of
course
old
roughleg
the
hawk
was
asleep
so
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
him
but
he
never
once
thought
of
hooty
the
owl
dear
me
dear
me
forgetting
is
a
dreadful
habit
if
nobody
ever
forgot
there
wouldn
t
be
nearly
so
much
trouble
in
the
world
no
indeed
there
wouldn
t
be
nearly
so
much
trouble
and
danny
meadow
mouse
forgot
he
skipped
and
sang
and
was
happy
as
could
be
and
never
once
thought
to
watch
up
in
the
sky
over
in
the
green
forest
hooty
the
owl
had
had
poor
hunting
and
he
was
feeling
cross
you
see
hooty
was
hungry
and
hunger
is
apt
to
make
one
feel
cross
the
longer
he
hunted
the
hungrier
and
crosser
he
grew
suddenly
he
thought
of
danny
meadow
mouse
i
suppose
he
is
asleep
somewhere
safe
and
snug
under
the
snow
grumbled
hooty
but
he
might
be
he
just
be
out
for
a
frolic
in
the
moonlight
i
believe
i
ll
go
down
on
the
meadows
and
now
hooty
the
owl
can
fly
without
making
the
teeniest
weeniest
sound
it
seems
as
if
he
just
drifts
along
through
the
air
like
a
great
shadow
now
he
spread
his
great
wings
and
floated
out
over
the
meadows
you
know
hooty
can
see
as
well
at
night
as
most
folks
can
by
day
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
danny
meadow
mouse
skipping
about
on
the
snow
and
dodging
in
and
out
of
his
little
round
doorways
hooty
s
great
eyes
grew
brighter
and
fiercer
without
a
sound
he
floated
through
the
moonlight
until
he
was
just
over
danny
meadow
mouse
too
late
danny
looked
up
his
little
song
ended
in
a
tiny
squeak
of
fear
and
he
started
for
his
nearest
little
round
doorway
hooty
the
owl
reached
down
with
his
long
cruel
claws
meadow
mouse
was
caught
at
last
x
a
strange
ride
and
how
it
ended
danny
meadow
mouse
often
had
sat
watching
skimmer
the
swallow
sailing
around
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
he
had
watched
ol
mistah
buzzard
go
up
up
up
until
he
was
nothing
but
a
tiny
speck
and
danny
had
wondered
how
it
would
seem
to
be
way
up
above
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
and
look
down
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
it
must
be
very
wonderful
and
beautiful
sometimes
he
had
wished
that
he
had
wings
and
could
go
up
in
the
air
and
look
down
and
now
here
he
was
he
danny
meadow
mouse
actually
doing
that
very
thing
illustration
he
was
being
carried
but
danny
could
see
nothing
wonderful
or
beautiful
now
no
indeed
everything
was
terrible
for
you
see
danny
meadow
mouse
wasn
t
flying
himself
he
was
being
carried
yes
sir
danny
meadow
mouse
was
being
carried
through
the
air
in
the
cruel
claws
of
hooty
the
owl
and
all
because
danny
had
to
watch
up
in
the
sky
for
danger
poor
poor
danny
meadow
mouse
hooty
s
great
cruel
claws
hurt
him
dreadfully
but
it
wasn
t
the
pain
that
was
the
worst
no
indeed
it
wasn
t
the
pain
it
was
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
when
hooty
reached
his
home
in
the
green
forest
for
he
knew
that
there
hooty
would
gobble
him
up
bones
and
all
as
he
flew
hooty
kept
chuckling
and
danny
meadow
mouse
knew
just
what
those
chuckles
meant
they
meant
that
hooty
was
thinking
of
the
good
meal
he
was
going
to
have
hanging
there
in
hooty
s
great
cruel
claws
danny
looked
down
on
the
green
meadows
he
loved
so
well
they
seemed
a
frightfully
long
way
below
him
though
really
they
were
not
far
at
all
for
hooty
was
flying
very
low
but
danny
meadow
mouse
had
never
in
all
his
life
been
so
high
up
before
and
so
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
way
way
up
in
the
sky
and
he
shut
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
but
he
couldn
t
keep
them
shut
no
sir
he
couldn
t
keep
them
shut
he
just
to
keep
opening
them
there
was
the
dear
old
green
forest
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
it
always
had
looked
very
beautiful
to
danny
meadow
mouse
but
now
it
looked
terrible
very
terrible
indeed
because
over
in
it
in
some
dark
place
was
the
home
of
hooty
the
owl
just
ahead
of
him
was
the
old
where
peter
rabbit
lives
so
safely
every
old
bramble
in
it
was
covered
with
snow
and
it
was
very
very
beautiful
really
everything
was
just
as
beautiful
as
moonlight
the
green
forest
the
green
meadows
the
old
the
only
change
was
in
danny
meadow
mouse
himself
and
it
was
all
because
he
had
forgotten
suddenly
danny
began
to
wriggle
and
struggle
keep
still
snapped
hooty
the
owl
but
danny
only
struggled
harder
than
ever
it
seemed
to
him
that
hooty
wasn
t
holding
him
as
tightly
as
at
first
he
felt
one
of
hooty
s
claws
slip
it
tore
his
coat
and
hurt
dreadfully
but
it
slipped
the
fact
is
hooty
had
only
grabbed
danny
meadow
mouse
by
the
loose
part
of
his
coat
and
up
in
the
air
he
couldn
t
get
hold
of
danny
any
better
danny
kicked
squirmed
and
twisted
and
twisted
squirmed
and
kicked
he
felt
his
coat
tear
and
of
course
the
skin
with
it
but
he
kept
right
on
for
now
he
was
hanging
almost
free
hooty
had
started
down
now
so
as
to
get
a
better
hold
danny
gave
one
more
kick
and
felt
himself
falling
danny
meadow
mouse
shut
his
eyes
and
held
his
breath
down
down
down
he
fell
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
never
would
strike
the
meadows
really
he
fell
only
a
very
little
distance
but
it
seemed
a
terrible
distance
to
danny
he
hit
something
that
scratched
him
and
then
plump
he
landed
in
the
soft
snow
right
in
the
very
middle
of
the
old
and
the
last
thing
he
remembered
was
hearing
the
scream
of
disappointment
and
rage
of
hooty
the
owl
xi
peter
rabbit
gets
a
fright
peter
rabbit
sat
in
his
favorite
place
in
the
middle
of
the
dear
old
trying
to
decide
which
way
he
would
go
on
his
travels
that
night
the
night
before
he
had
had
a
narrow
escape
from
old
granny
fox
over
in
the
green
forest
there
was
nothing
to
eat
around
the
smiling
pool
and
no
one
to
talk
to
there
any
more
and
you
know
that
peter
must
either
eat
or
ask
questions
in
order
to
be
perfectly
happy
no
the
smiling
pool
was
too
dull
a
place
to
interest
peter
on
such
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
peter
had
no
mind
to
try
his
legs
against
those
of
old
granny
fox
again
in
the
green
forest
early
that
morning
just
after
peter
had
settled
down
for
his
morning
nap
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
had
dropped
into
the
dear
old
just
to
be
neighborly
peter
was
just
dozing
off
when
he
heard
the
cheeriest
little
voice
in
the
world
it
was
saying
i
see
you
can
you
see
me
peter
began
to
smile
even
before
he
could
get
his
eyes
open
and
look
up
there
right
over
his
head
was
tommy
tit
hanging
head
down
from
a
nodding
old
bramble
in
a
twinkling
he
was
down
on
the
snow
right
in
front
of
peter
then
up
in
the
brambles
again
right
side
up
upside
down
here
there
everywhere
never
still
a
minute
and
all
the
time
chattering
away
in
the
cheeriest
little
voice
in
the
world
i
m
as
happy
as
can
be
find
it
much
the
better
way
to
be
happy
all
the
day
everybody
s
good
to
me
hello
tommy
said
peter
rabbit
where
d
you
come
from
from
farmer
brown
s
new
orchard
up
on
the
hill
it
s
a
fine
orchard
peter
rabbit
a
fine
orchard
i
go
there
every
morning
for
my
breakfast
if
the
winter
lasts
long
enough
i
ll
have
all
the
trees
cleaned
up
for
farmer
peter
looked
puzzled
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
just
what
i
say
replied
tommy
tit
almost
turning
a
somersault
in
the
air
there
s
a
million
eggs
of
insects
on
those
young
but
i
m
clearing
them
all
off
as
fast
as
i
can
they
re
mighty
fine
eating
peter
rabbit
mighty
fine
eating
and
with
that
tommy
tit
had
said
and
flitted
away
peter
was
thinking
of
that
young
orchard
now
as
he
sat
in
the
moonlight
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
where
to
go
the
thought
of
those
young
made
his
mouth
water
it
was
a
long
way
up
to
the
orchard
on
the
hill
a
very
long
way
and
peter
was
wondering
if
it
really
was
safe
to
go
he
had
just
about
made
up
his
mind
to
try
it
for
peter
is
very
very
fond
of
the
bark
of
young
when
thump
something
dropped
out
of
the
sky
at
his
very
feet
it
startled
peter
so
that
he
nearly
tumbled
over
backward
and
right
at
the
same
instant
came
the
fierce
angry
scream
of
hooty
the
owl
that
almost
made
peter
s
heart
stop
beating
although
he
knew
that
hooty
couldn
t
get
him
down
there
in
the
old
when
peter
got
his
wits
together
and
his
heart
didn
t
go
so
jumpy
he
looked
to
see
what
had
dropped
so
close
to
him
out
of
the
sky
his
big
eyes
grew
bigger
than
ever
and
he
rubbed
them
to
make
quite
sure
that
he
really
saw
what
he
thought
he
saw
yes
there
was
no
doubt
about
at
his
feet
lay
danny
meadow
mouse
xii
the
old
has
a
new
tenant
danny
meadow
mouse
slowly
opened
his
eyes
and
then
closed
them
again
quickly
as
if
afraid
to
look
around
he
could
hear
some
one
talking
it
was
a
pleasant
voice
not
at
all
like
the
terrible
voice
of
hooty
the
owl
which
was
the
very
last
thing
that
danny
meadow
mouse
could
remember
danny
lay
still
a
minute
and
listened
why
danny
meadow
mouse
where
in
the
world
did
you
drop
from
asked
the
voice
it
sounded
very
much
like
peter
rabbit
speaking
danny
opened
his
eyes
again
it
peter
rabbit
am
i
asked
danny
meadow
mouse
in
a
very
weak
and
small
voice
in
the
middle
of
the
dear
old
with
me
replied
peter
rabbit
but
how
did
you
get
here
you
seemed
to
drop
right
out
of
the
danny
meadow
mouse
shuddered
suddenly
he
remembered
everything
how
hooty
the
owl
had
caught
him
in
great
cruel
claws
and
had
carried
him
through
the
moonlight
across
the
green
meadows
how
he
had
felt
hooty
s
claws
slip
and
then
had
struggled
and
kicked
and
twisted
and
turned
until
his
coat
had
torn
and
he
had
dropped
down
down
down
until
he
had
landed
in
the
soft
snow
and
knocked
all
the
breath
out
of
his
little
body
the
very
last
thing
he
could
remember
was
hooty
s
fierce
scream
of
rage
and
disappointment
danny
shuddered
again
then
a
new
thought
came
to
him
he
must
get
out
of
sight
hooty
might
catch
him
again
danny
tried
to
scramble
to
his
feet
ooch
oh
groaned
danny
and
lay
still
again
there
there
keep
still
danny
meadow
mouse
there
s
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
here
said
peter
rabbit
gently
his
big
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
he
looked
at
danny
meadow
mouse
for
danny
was
all
torn
and
hurt
by
the
cruel
claws
of
hooty
the
owl
and
you
know
peter
has
a
very
tender
heart
so
danny
lay
still
and
while
peter
rabbit
tried
to
make
him
comfortable
and
dress
his
hurts
he
told
peter
all
about
how
he
had
forgotten
to
watch
up
in
the
sky
and
so
had
been
caught
by
hooty
the
owl
and
all
about
his
terrible
ride
in
hooty
s
cruel
claws
oh
dear
whatever
shall
i
do
now
he
ended
however
shall
i
get
back
home
to
my
warm
house
of
grass
my
safe
little
tunnels
under
the
snow
and
my
little
store
of
seeds
in
the
snug
hollow
in
the
old
peter
rabbit
looked
thoughtful
you
can
t
do
it
said
he
you
simply
can
t
do
it
it
is
such
a
long
way
for
a
little
fellow
like
you
that
it
wouldn
t
be
safe
to
try
if
you
went
at
night
hooty
the
owl
might
catch
you
again
if
you
tried
in
daylight
old
roughleg
the
hawk
would
be
almost
sure
to
see
you
and
night
or
day
old
granny
fox
or
reddy
fox
might
come
snooping
around
and
if
they
did
they
would
be
sure
to
catch
you
i
tell
you
what
you
stay
right
here
the
dear
old
is
the
safest
place
in
the
world
why
just
think
here
you
can
come
out
in
broad
daylight
and
laugh
at
granny
and
reddy
fox
and
at
old
roughleg
the
hawk
because
the
good
old
brambles
will
keep
them
out
if
they
try
to
get
you
you
can
make
just
as
good
tunnels
under
the
snow
here
as
you
had
there
and
there
are
lots
and
lots
of
seeds
on
the
ground
to
eat
you
know
i
don
t
care
for
them
myself
i
m
lonesome
sometimes
living
here
all
alone
you
stay
here
and
we
ll
have
the
old
to
danny

mouse
looked
at
peter
gratefully
i
will
and
thank
you
ever
so
much
peter

said
and
this
is
how
the
dear
old
happened
to
have
another

begged
danny
meadow

peter
hopped
to
the
edge
of
the
old
and
looked
over
the
moonlit
meadows
to
the
hill
back
of
farmer
brown
s
house
on
that
hill
was
the
young
peach
orchard
of
which
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
had
told
him
and
ever
since
peter
s
mouth
had
watered
and

of

peter
it

a
long
way
and

and
with
that
peter
rabbit
left
the
dear
safe
old
and
away
he
went
across
the
green
meadows
towards
the
hill
and
the
young
orchard
back
of
farmer
brown
s
house
danny
meadow
mouse
watched
him
go
and
shook
his
head
in
disapproval
foolish
foolish
foolish
he
said
over
and
over
to
himself
why
can
t
peter
be
content
with
the
good
things
that
he
has
peter
rabbit
hurried
along
through
the
moonlight
stopping
every
few
minutes
to
sit
up
to
look
and
listen
he
heard
the
fierce
hunting
call
of
hooty
the
owl
way
over
in
the
green
forest
so
he
felt
sure
that
at
present
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
him
he
knew
that
since
their
return
to
the
green
meadows
and
the
green
forest
granny
and
reddy
fox
had
kept
away
from
farmer
brown
s
so
he
did
not
worry
about
them
all
in
good
time
peter
came
to
the
young
orchard
it
was
just
as
tommy
tit
the
chickadee
had
told
him
peter
hopped
up
to
the
nearest
and
nibbled
the
bark
my
how
good
it
tasted
he
went
all
around
the
tree
stripping
off
the
bark
he
stood
up
on
his
long
hind
legs
and
reached
as
high
as
he
could
then
he
dug
the
snow
away
and
ate
down
as
far
as
he
could
when
he
could
get
no
more
tender
young
bark
he
went
on
to
the
next
tree
now
though
peter
didn
t
know
it
he
was
in
the
very
worst
kind
of
mischief
you
see
when
he
took
off
all
the
bark
all
the
way
around
the
young
he
killed
the
tree
for
you
know
it
is
on
the
inside
of
the
bark
that
the
sap
which
gives
life
to
a
tree
and
makes
it
grow
goes
up
from
the
roots
to
all
the
branches
so
when
peter
ate
the
bark
all
the
way
around
the
trunk
of
the
young
tree
he
had
made
it
impossible
for
the
sap
to
come
up
in
the
spring
oh
it
was
the
very
worst
kind
of
mischief
that
peter
rabbit
was
in
but
peter
didn
t
know
it
and
he
kept
right
on
filling
that
big
stomach
of
his
and
enjoying
it
so
much
that
he
forgot
to
watch
out
for
danger
suddenly
just
as
he
had
begun
on
another
tree
a
great
roar
right
behind
him
made
him
jump
almost
out
of
his
skin
he
knew
that
voice
and
without
waiting
to
even
look
behind
him
he
started
for
the
stone
wall
on
the
other
side
of
the
orchard
right
at
his
heels
his
great
mouth
wide
open
was
bowser

hound
xiv
farmer
brown
sets
a
trap
peter
rabbit
was
in
trouble
he
had
gotten
into
mischief
and
now
like
every
one
who
gets
into
mischief
he
wished
that
he
hadn
t
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
was
a
long
way
from
his
home
in
the
dear
old
and
he
didn
t
know
how
he
ever
could
get
back
there
again
where
was
he
why
in
the
stone
wall
on
one
side
of
farmer
brown
s
young
peach
orchard
how
peter
blessed
the
old
stone
wall
in
which
he
had
found
a
safe
bowser
had
hung
around
nearly
all
night
so
that
peter
had
not
dared
to
try
to
go
home
now
it
was
daylight
and
peter
knew
it
would
not
be
safe
to
put
his
nose
outside
peter
was
worried
so
worried
that
he
couldn
t
go
to
sleep
as
he
usually
does
in
the
daytime
so
he
sat
hidden
in
the
old
wall
and
waited
and
watched
by
and
by
he
saw
farmer
brown
and
farmer
brown
s
boy
come
out
into
the
orchard
right
away
they
saw
the
mischief
which
peter
had
done
and
he
could
tell
by
the
sound
of
their
voices
that
they
were
very
very
angry
they
went
away
but
before
long
they
were
back
again
and
all
day
long
peter
watched
them
work
putting
something
around
each
of
the
young
peter
grew
so
curious
that
he
forgot
all
about
his
troubles
and
how
far
away
from
home
he
was
he
could
hardly
wait
for
night
to
come
so
that
he
might
see
what
they
had
been
doing
just
as
jolly
round
red
sun
started
to
go
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
farmer
brown
and
his
boy
started
back
to
the
house
farmer
brown
was
smiling
now
i
guess
that
that
will
fix
him
he
said
now
what
does
he
mean
by
that
thought
peter
who
will
it
fix
can
it
be
me
i
don
t
need
any
he
waited
just
as
long
as
he
could
when
all
was
still
and
the
moonlight
had
begun
to
make
shadows
of
the
trees
on
the
snow
peter
very
cautiously
crept
out
of
his
bowser
the
hound
was
nowhere
in
sight
and
everything
was
as
quiet
and
peaceful
as
it
had
been
when
he
first
came
into
the
orchard
the
night
before
peter
had
fully
made
up
his
mind
to
go
straight
home
as
fast
as
his
long
legs
would
take
him
but
his
dreadful
curiosity
insisted
that
first
he
must
find
out
what
farmer
brown
and
his
boy
had
been
doing
to
the
young
so
peter
hurried
over
to
the
nearest
tree
all
around
the
trunk
of
the
tree
from
the
ground
clear
up
higher
than
peter
could
reach
was
wrapped
wire
netting
peter
couldn
t
get
so
much
as
a
nibble
of
the
delicious
bark
he
hadn
t
intended
to
take
any
for
he
had
meant
to
go
right
straight
home
but
now
that
he
couldn
t
get
any
he
wanted
some
more
than
ever
a
bite
peter
looked
around
everything
was
quiet
he
would
try
the
next
tree
and
then
he
would
go
home
but
the
next
tree
was
wrapped
with
wire
peter
hesitated
looked
around
turned
to
go
home
thought
of
how
good
that
bark
had
tasted
the
night
before
hesitated
again
and
then
hurried
over
to
the
third
tree
it
was
protected
just
like
the
others
then
peter
forgot
all
about
going
home
he
wanted
some
of
that
delicious
bark
and
he
ran
from
one
tree
to
another
as
fast
as
he
could
go
at
last
way
down
at
the
end
of
the
orchard
peter
found
a
tree
that
had
no
wire
around
it
they
must
have
forgotten
this
one
he
thought
and
his
eyes
sparkled
all
around
on
the
snow
were
a
lot
of
little
shiny
wires
but
peter
didn
t
notice
them
all
he
saw
was
that
delicious
bark
on
the
young
he
hopped
right
into
the
middle
of
the
wires
and
then
just
as
he
reached
up
to
take
the
first
bite
of
bark
he
felt
something
tugging
at
one
of
his
hind
legs
xv
peter
rabbit
is
caught
in
a
snare
when
peter
rabbit
reaching
up
to
nibble
the
bark
of
one
of
farmer
brown
s
young
trees
felt
something
tugging
at
one
of
his
hind
legs
he
was
so
startled
that
he
jumped
to
get
away
instead
of
doing
this
he
fell
flat
on
his
face
the
thing
on
his
hind
leg
had
tightened
and
held
him
fast
a
great
fear
came
to
peter
rabbit
and
lying
there
in
the
snow
he
kicked
and
struggled
with
all
his
might
but
the
more
he
kicked
the
tighter
grew
that
hateful
thing
on
his
leg
finally
he
grew
too
tired
to
kick
any
more
and
lay
still
the
dreadful
thing
that
held
him
hurt
his
leg
but
it
didn
t
pull
when
he
lay
still
when
he
had
grown
a
little
calmer
peter
sat
up
to
examine
the
thing
which
held
him
so
fast
it
was
something
like
one
of
the
blackberry
vines
he
had
sometimes
tripped
over
only
it
was
bright
and
shiny
and
had
no
branches
or
tiny
prickers
and
one
end
was
fastened
to
a
stake
peter
tried
to
bite
off
the
shiny
thing
but
even
his
great
sharp
front
teeth
couldn
t
cut
it
then
peter
knew
what
it
was
it
was
wire
it
was
a
snare
which
farmer
brown
had
set
to
catch
him
and
which
he
had
walked
right
into
because
he
had
been
so
greedy
for
the
bark
of
the
young
that
he
had
not
used
his
eyes
to
look
out
for
danger
oh
how
peter
rabbit
did
wish
that
he
had
not
been
so
curious
to
know
what
farmer
brown
had
been
doing
that
day
and
that
he
had
gone
straight
home
as
he
had
meant
to
do
instead
of
trying
to
get
one
more
meal
of
young
big
tears
rolled
down
peter
s
cheeks
what
should
he
do
what
he
do
for
a
long
time
peter
sat
in
the
moonlight
trying
to
think
of
something
to
do
at
last
he
thought
of
the
stake
to
which
that
hateful
wire
was
fastened
the
stake
was
of
wood
and
peter
s
teeth
would
cut
wood
peter
s
heart
gave
a
great
leap
of
hope
and
he
began
at
once
to
dig
away
the
snow
from
around
the
stake
and
then
settled
himself
to
gnaw
the
stake
in
two
peter
had
been
hard
at
work
on
the
stake
a
long
time
and
had
it
a
little
more
than
half
cut
through
when
he
heard
a
loud
sniff
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
orchard
he
looked
up
to
do
you
think
why
bowser
the
hound
he
hadn
t
seen
peter
yet
but
he
had
already
found
peter
s
tracks
and
it
wouldn
t
be
but
a
few
minutes
before
he
found
peter
himself
poor
peter
rabbit
there
wasn
t
time
to
finish
cutting
off
the
stake
what
could
he
do
he
made
a
frightened
jump
just
as
he
had
when
he
first
felt
the
wire
tugging
at
his
leg
just
as
before
he
was
thrown
flat
on
his
face
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
jumped
again
only
to
be
thrown
just
as
before
just
then
bowser
the
hound
saw
him
and
opening
his
mouth
sent
forth
a
great
roar
peter
made
one
more
frantic
jump
snap
the
stake
had
broken
peter
pitched
forward
on
his
head
turned
a
somersault
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
he
was
free
at
last
that
is
he
could
run
but
after
him
dragged
a
piece
of
the
stake
how
peter
did
run
it
was
hard
work
for
you
know
he
had
to
drag
that
piece
of
stake
after
him
but
he
did
it
and
just
in
time
he
crawled
into
the
old
stone
wall
on
one
side
of
the
orchard
while
bowser
the
hound
barked
his
disappointment
to
the
moon
xvi
peter
rabbit
s
hard
journey
peter
rabbit
sat
in
the
old
stone
wall
along
one
side
of
farmer
brown
s
orchard
waiting
for
mrs
moon
to
put
out
her
light
and
leave
the
world
in
darkness
until
jolly
round
red
sun
should
kick
off
his
rosy
bedclothes
and
begin
his
daily
climb
up
in
the
blue
blue
sky
in
the
winter
sun
is
a
late
sleeper
and
peter
knew
that
there
would
be
two
or
three
hours
after
mrs
moon
put
out
her
light
when
it
would
be
quite
dark
and
peter
also
knew
too
that
by
this
time
hooty
the
owl
would
probably
have
caught
his
dinner
so
would
old
granny
fox
and
reddy
fox
bowser
the
hound
would
be
too
sleepy
to
be
on
the
watch
it
would
be
the
very
safest
time
for
peter
to
try
to
get
to
his
home
in
the
dear
old
so
peter
waited
and
waited
twice
bowser
the
hound
who
had
chased
him
into
the
old
wall
came
over
and
barked
at
him
and
tried
to
get
at
him
but
the
old
wall
kept
peter
safe
and
bowser
gave
it
up
and
all
the
time
peter
sat
waiting
he
was
in
great
pain
you
see
that
shiny
wire
was
drawn
so
tight
that
it
cut
into
his
flesh
and
hurt
dreadfully
and
to
the
other
end
of
the
wire
was
fastened
a
piece
of
wood
part
of
the
stake
to
which
the
snare
had
been
made
fast
and
which
peter
had
managed
to
gnaw
and
break
off
it
was
on
account
of
this
that
peter
was
waiting
for
mrs
moon
to
put
out
her
light
he
knew
that
with
that
stake
dragging
after
him
he
would
have
to
go
very
slowly
and
he
could
not
run
any
more
risk
of
danger
than
he
actually
had
to
so
he
waited
and
waited
and
by
and
by
sure
enough
mrs
moon
put
out
her
light
peter
waited
a
little
longer
listening
with
all
his
might
everything
was
still
then
peter
crept
out
of
the
old
stone
wall
right
away
trouble
began
the
stake
dragging
at
the
end
of
the
wire
fast
to
his
leg
caught
among
the
stones
and
pulled
peter
up
short
my
how
it
did
hurt
it
made
the
tears
come
but
peter
shut
his
teeth
hard
and
turning
back
he
worked
until
he
got
the
stake
free
then
he
started
on
once
more
dragging
the
stake
after
him
very
slowly
across
the
orchard
and
under
the
fence
on
the
other
side
crept
peter
rabbit
his
leg
so
stiff
and
sore
that
he
could
hardly
touch
it
to
the
snow
and
all
the
time
dragging
that
piece
of
stake
which
seemed
to
grow
heavier
and
harder
to
drag
every
minute
peter
did
not
dare
to
go
out
across
the
open
fields
for
fear
some
danger
might
happen
along
and
he
would
have
no
place
to
hide
so
he
crept
along
close
to
the
fences
where
bushes
grow
and
this
made
it
very
very
hard
for
the
dragging
stake
was
forever
catching
in
the
bushes
with
a
yank
at
the
sore
leg
which
brought
peter
up
short
with
a
squeal
of
pain
this
was
bad
enough
but
all
the
time
peter
was
filled
with
a
dreadful
fear
that
hooty
the
owl
or
granny
fox
might
just
happen
along
he
had
to
stop
to
rest
very
very
often
and
then
he
would
listen
and
listen
over
and
over
again
he
said
to
himself
oh
dear
whatever
did
i
go
up
to
the
young
peach
orchard
for
when
i
knew
i
had
no
business
there
why
couldn
t
i
have
been
content
with
all
the
good
things
that
were
mine
in
the
green
forest
and
on
the
green
meadows
oh
dear
oh
dear
just
as
jolly
round
red
sun
began
to
light
up
the
green
meadows
peter
rabbit
reached
the
dear
old
danny
meadow
mouse
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
it
anxiously
watching
for
him
peter
crawled
up
and
started
to
creep
in
along
one
of
his
little
private
paths
he
got
in
himself
but
the
dragging
stake
caught
among
the
brambles
and
peter
just
fell
down
in
the
snow
right
where
he
was
too
tired
and
worn
out
to
move

around

where

had
lived
with

ever
since

had
squirmed
out
of
the
claws

was
still

claws
but
he
didn

let
himself
think
much
about
that
because
he
was
so
thankful
to
be
alive
at
all
so
he
limped
around
in
the
old
picking
up
seed
which
had
fallen
on
the

and
sometimes
pulling
down
a
few
of
the
red
berries
which
cling
all

to

in

were

danny
felt
that
he
never
never
could
repay
all
of
peter
s
kindness
it
had
been
very
good
of
peter
to
offer
to
share
the
old
with
danny
because
danny
was
so
far
from
his
own
home
that
it
would
not
be
safe
for
him
to
try
to
get
back
there
but
peter
had
done
more
than
that
he
had
taken
care
of
danny
such
good
care
during
the
first
few
days
after
danny
s
escape
from
hooty
the
owl
he
had
brought
good
things
to
eat
while
danny
was
too
weak
and
sore
to
get
things
for
himself
oh
peter
had
been
very
good
indeed
to
him
but
now
as
danny
limped
around
he
was
not
happy
no
sir
he
was
not
happy
the
truth
is
danny
meadow
mouse
was
worried
it
was
a
different
kind
of
worry
from
any
he
had
known
before
you
see
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
danny
was
worrying
about
some
one
else
he
was
worrying
about
peter
rabbit
peter
had
been
gone
from
the
old
a
whole
night
and
a
whole
day
he
often
was
gone
all
night
but
never
all
day
too
danny
was
sure
that
something
had
happened
to
peter
he
thought
of
how
he
had
begged
peter
not
to
go
up
to
farmer
brown
s
young
peach
orchard
he
had
felt
in
his
bones
that
it
was
not
safe
that
something
dreadful
would
happen
to
peter
how
peter
had
laughed
at
him
and
bravely
started
off
why
hadn
t
he
come
home
as
he
limped
around
danny
talked
to
himself
why
can
not
people
be
content
with
all
the
good
things
that
are
sent
and
mind
their
own
affairs
at
home
instead
of
going
forth
to
roam
it
was
now
the
second
night
since
peter
rabbit
had
gone
away
danny
meadow
mouse
couldn
t
sleep
at
all
round
and
round
through
the
old
he
limped
and
finally
sat
down
at
the
edge
of
it
to
wait
and
watch
at
last
just
as
jolly
round
red
sun
sent
his
first
long
rays
of
light
across
the
green
meadows
danny
saw
something
crawling
towards
the
old
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
it
it
couldn
t
it
peter
rabbit
but
what
was
the
matter
with
him
always
before
peter
had
come
home
but
now
he
was
crawling
actually
danny
meadow
mouse
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
it
nearer
and
nearer
came
peter
something
was
following
him
no
peter
was
dragging
something
after
him
at
last
peter
started
to
crawl
along
one
of
his
little
private
paths
into
the
old
the
thing
dragging
behind
caught
in
the
brambles
and
peter
fell
headlong
in
the
snow
too
tired
and
worn
out
to
move
then
danny
saw
what
the
trouble
was
a
wire
was
fast
to
one
of
peter
s
long
hind
legs
and
to
the
other
end
of
the
wire
was
fastened
part
of
a
stake
peter
had
been
caught
in
a
snare
danny
hurried
over
to
peter
and
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
poor
peter
rabbit
oh
i
m
so
sorry
peter
he
whispered
xviii
danny
meadow
mouse
returns
a
kindness
there
peter
rabbit
lay
he
had
dragged
that
piece
of
stake
a
long
way
a
very
long
way
indeed
but
now
he
could
drag
it
no
farther
for
it
had
caught
in
the
bramble
bushes
so
peter
just
dropped
on
the
snow
and
cried
yes
sir
he
cried
you
see
he
was
so
tired
and
worn
out
and
frightened
and
his
leg
was
so
stiff
and
sore
and
hurt
him
so
and
then
it
was
so
dreadful
to
actually
get
home
and
be
stopped
right
on
your
very
own
so
peter
just
lay
there
and
cried
just
supposing
old
granny
fox
should
come
poking
around
and
find
peter
caught
that
way
all
she
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
get
hold
of
that
hateful
stake
caught
in
the
bramble
bushes
and
pull
peter
out
where
she
could
get
him
do
you
wonder
that
peter
cried
by
and
by
he
became
aware
that
some
one
was
wiping
away
his
tears
it
was
danny
meadow
mouse
and
danny
was
singing
in
a
funny
little
voice
pretty
soon
peter
stopped
crying
and
listened
and
this
is
what
he
heard
isn
t
any
use
to
cry
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
wipe
your
eyes
and
wipe
em
dry
use
your
wit
use
your
wit
just
remember
that
never
brings
a
single
sorrow
yesterday
has
gone
forever
and
gets
here
never
chase
your
worries
all
away
nothing
s
worse
than
just
peter
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
that
s
right
that
s
right
smile
away
peter
rabbit
smile
away
your
troubles
sir
are
all
and
between
you
and
me
i
don
t
believe
they
are
so
bad
as
you
think
they
are
now
you
lie
still
just
where
you
are
while
i
go
see
what
can
be
illustration
peter
knew
that
danny
was
doing
something
at
the
other
end
with
that
off
whisked
danny
meadow
mouse
as
spry
as
you
please
in
spite
of
his
lame
leg
and
in
a
few
minutes
peter
knew
by
little
twitches
of
the
wire
on
his
leg
that
danny
was
doing
something
at
the
other
end
he
was
danny
meadow
mouse
had
set
out
to
gnaw
that
piece
of
stake
all
to
splinters
so
there
he
sat
and
gnawed
and
gnawed
and
gnawed
jolly
round
red
sun
climbed
higher
and
higher
in
the
sky
and
danny
meadow
mouse
grew
hungry
but
still
he
kept
right
on
gnawing
at
that
bothersome
stake
by
and
by
happening
to
look
across
the
green
meadows
he
saw
something
that
made
his
heart
jump
it
was
farmer
brown
s
boy
coming
straight
over
towards
the
dear
old
danny
didn
t
say
a
word
to
peter
rabbit
but
gnawed
faster
than
ever
farmer
brown
s
boy
was
almost
there
when
danny
stopped
gnawing
there
was
only
a
tiny
bit
of
the
stake
left
now
and
danny
hurried
to
tell
peter
rabbit
that
there
was
nothing
to
stop
him
now
from
going
to
his
most
secret
retreat
in
the
very
heart
of
the
old
while
peter
slowly
dragged
his
way
along
danny
trotted
behind
to
see
that
the
wire
did
not
catch
on
the
bushes
they
had
safely
reached
peter
rabbit
s
secretest
retreat
when
farmer
brown
s
boy
came
up
to
the
edge
of
the
dear
old
so
this
is
where
that
rabbit
that
killed
our
lives
said
he
we
ll
try
a
few
snares
and
put
you
out
of
and
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
farmer
brown
s
boy
was
very
busy
around
the
edge
of
the
old
xix
peter
rabbit
and
danny
meadow
mouse
live
high
peter
rabbit
sat
in
his
secretest
place
in
the
dear
old
with
one
of
his
long
hind
legs
all
swelled
up
and
terribly
sore
because
of
the
fine
wire
fast
around
it
and
cutting
into
it
he
could
hear
farmer
brown
s
boy
going
around
on
the
edge
of
the
dear
old
and
stopping
every
little
while
to
do
something
in
spite
of
his
pain
peter
was
curious
finally
he
called
danny
meadow
mouse
danny
you
are
small
and
can
keep
out
of
sight
easier
than
i
can
go
as
near
as
ever
you
dare
to
farmer
brown
s
boy
and
find
out
what
he
is
doing
said
peter
rabbit
so
danny
meadow
mouse
crept
out
as
near
to
farmer
brown
s
boy
as
ever
he
dared
and
studied
and
studied
to
make
out
what
farmer
brown
s
boy
was
doing
by
and
by
he
returned
to
peter
rabbit
i
don
t
know
what
he
s
doing
peter
but
he
s
putting
something
in
every
one
of
your
private
little
paths
leading
in
from
the
green
ha
said
peter
rabbit
there
are
little
loops
of
that
queer
stuff
you
ve
got
hanging
to
your
leg
peter
continued
danny
meadow
mouse
just
so
said
peter
rabbit
and
he
s
put
cabbage
leaves
and
pieces
of
apple
all
around
said
danny
we
must
be
careful
said
peter
rabbit
peter
s
leg
was
in
a
very
bad
way
indeed
and
peter
suffered
a
great
deal
of
pain
the
worst
of
it
was
he
didn
t
know
how
to
get
off
the
wire
that
was
cutting
into
it
so
he
had
tried
to
cut
the
wire
with
his
big
teeth
but
he
couldn
t
do
it
danny
meadow
mouse
had
tried
and
tried
to
gnaw
the
wire
but
it
wasn
t
of
the
least
bit
of
use
but
danny
wasn
t
easily
discouraged
and
he
kept
working
and
working
at
it
once
he
thought
he
felt
it
slip
a
little
he
said
nothing
but
kept
right
on
working
pretty
soon
he
was
sure
that
it
slipped
he
went
right
on
working
harder
than
ever
by
and
by
he
had
it
so
loose
that
he
slipped
it
right
off
of
peter
s
leg
and
peter
didn
t
know
anything
about
it
you
see
that
cruel
wire
snare
had
been
so
tight
that
peter
didn
t
have
any
feeling
except
of
pain
left
in
his
leg
and
so
when
danny
meadow
mouse
pulled
the
cruel
wire
snare
off
peter
didn
t
know
it
until
danny
held
it
up
in
front
of
him
my
how
thankful
peter
was
and
how
he
did
thank
danny
meadow
mouse
but
danny
said
that
it
was
nothing
at
all
just
nothing
at
all
and
that
he
owed
more
than
that
to
peter
rabbit
for
being
so
good
to
him
and
letting
him
live
in
the
dear
old
it
was
a
long
time
before
peter
could
hop
as
he
used
to
but
after
the
first
day
he
managed
to
get
around
he
found
that
farmer
brown
s
boy
had
spread
those
miserable
wire
snares
in
every
one
of
his
private
little
paths
but
peter
knew
what
they
were
now
he
showed
danny
meadow
mouse
how
he
because
he
was
so
small
could
safely
run
about
among
the
snares
and
steal
all
the
cabbage
leaves
and
apples
which
farmer
brown
s
boy
had
put
there
for
bait
danny
meadow
mouse
thought
this
great
fun
and
a
great
joke
on
farmer
brown
s
boy
so
every
day
he
stole
the
bait
and
he
and
peter
rabbit
lived
high
while
peter
s
leg
was
getting
well
and
all
the
time
farmer
brown
s
boy
wondered
and
wondered
why
he
couldn
t
catch
peter
rabbit
xx
timid
danny
meadow
mouse
danny
meadow
mouse
is
timid
everybody
says
so
and
what
everybody
says
ought
to
be
so
but
just
as
anybody
can
make
a
mistake
sometimes
so
can
everybody
still
in
this
case
it
is
quite
likely
that
everybody
is
right
danny
meadow
mouse
timid
ask
peter
rabbit
ask
sammy
jay
ask
striped
chipmunk
they
will
all
tell
you
the
same
thing
sammy
jay
might
even
tell
you
that
danny
is
afraid
of
his
own
shadow
or
that
he
tries
to
run
away
from
his
own
tail
of
course
this
isn
t
true
sammy
jay
likes
to
say
mean
things
it
isn
t
fair
to
danny
meadow
mouse
to
believe
what
sammy
jay
says
but
the
fact
is
danny
certainly
is
timid
more
than
this
he
isn
t
ashamed
of
the
least
little
bit
you
see
it
s
this
way
said
danny
as
he
sat
on
his
one
sunny
morning
talking
to
his
friend
old
toad
if
i
weren
t
afraid
i
wouldn
t
be
all
the
time
watching
out
and
if
i
weren
t
all
the
time
watching
out
i
wouldn
t
have
any
more
chance
than
that
foolish
red
ant
running
across
in
front
of
old
toad
looked
where
danny
was
pointing
and
his
tongue
darted
out
and
back
again
so
quickly
that
danny
wasn
t
sure
that
he
saw
it
at
all
but
when
he
looked
for
the
ant
it
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
there
was
a
satisfied
twinkle
in
toad
s
eyes
there
was
an
answering
twinkle
in
danny
s
own
eyes
as
he
continued
no
sir
said
he
i
wouldn
t
stand
a
particle
more
chance
than
that
foolish
ant
did
now
if
i
were
big
and
strong
like
old
man
coyote
or
had
swift
wings
like
skimmer
the
swallow
or
were
so
homely
and
ugly
looking
that
no
one
wanted
me
danny
hesitated
and
then
finished
rather
lamely
like
some
folks
i
know
i
suppose
i
wouldn
t
be
old
toad
looked
up
sharply
when
danny
mentioned
homely
and
ugly
looking
people
but
danny
was
gazing
far
out
across
the
green
meadows
and
looked
so
innocent
that
toad
concluded
that
he
couldn
t
have
had
him
in
mind
well
said
he
thoughtfully
scratching
his
nose
i
suppose
you
may
be
right
but
for
my
part
fear
seems
a
very
foolish
thing
now
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
i
mind
my
own
business
and
no
one
ever
bothers
me
i
should
think
it
would
be
a
very
uncomfortable
it
is
replied
danny
but
as
i
said
before
it
is
a
very
good
thing
to
keep
one
on
guard
when
there
are
so
many
watching
for
one
as
there
are
for
me
now
there
s
blacksnake
where
exclaimed
old
toad
turning
as
pale
as
a
toad
can
turn
and
looking
uneasily
and
anxiously
in
every
direction
danny
turned
his
head
to
hide
a
smile
if
old
toad
wasn
t
showing
fear
no
one
ever
did
oh
said
he
i
didn
t
mean
that
he
is
anywhere
around
here
now
what
i
was
going
to
say
was
that
there
is
blacksnake
and
granny
fox
and
reddy
fox
and
redtail
the
hawk
and
hooty
the
owl
and
others
i
might
name
always
watching
for
a
chance
to
make
a
dinner
from
poor
little
me
do
you
wonder
that
i
am
afraid
most
of
the
time
no
replied
old
toad
no
i
don
t
wonder
that
you
are
afraid
it
must
be
dreadful
to
feel
hungry
eyes
are
watching
for
you
every
minute
of
the
day
and
night
oh
it
s
not
so
bad
replied
danny
it
s
rather
exciting
besides
it
keeps
my
wits
sharp
all
the
time
i
am
afraid
i
should
find
life
very
dull
indeed
if
like
you
i
feared
nothing
and
nobody
by
the
way
see
how
queerly
that
grass
is
moving
over
there
it
looks
as
if
toad
where
are
you
going
in
such
a
hurry
i
ve
just
remembered
an
important
engagement
with
my
cousin
grandfather
frog
at
the
smiling
pool
shouted
old
toad
over
his
shoulder
as
he
hurried
so
that
he
fell
over
his
own
feet
danny
chuckled
as
he
sat
alone
on
his
oh
no
old
toad
doesn
t
know
what
fear
is
said
he
funny
how
some
people
won
t
admit
what
everybody
can
see
for
themselves
now
i
afraid
and
i
m
willing
to
say
xxi
an
exciting
day
for
danny
meadow
mouse
danny
meadow
mouse
started
along
one
of
his
private
little
paths
very
early
one
morning
he
was
on
his
way
to
get
a
supply
of
a
certain
kind
of
of
which
he
is
very
fond
he
had
been
thinking
about
that
seed
for
some
time
and
waiting
for
it
to
get
ripe
now
it
was
just
right
as
he
had
found
out
the
day
before
by
a
visit
to
the
place
where
this
particular
grass
grew
the
only
trouble
was
it
grew
a
long
way
from
danny
s
home
and
to
reach
it
he
had
to
cross
an
open
place
where
the
grass
was
so
short
that
he
couldn
t
make
a
path
under
it
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
that
this
is
going
to
be
an
exciting
day
said
danny
to
himself
as
he
trotted
along
i
suppose
that
if
i
were
really
wise
i
would
stay
nearer
home
and
do
without
that
nice
seed
but
nothing
is
really
worth
having
unless
it
is
worth
working
for
and
that
seed
will
taste
all
the
better
if
i
have
hard
work
getting
so
he
trotted
along
his
private
little
path
his
ears
wide
open
and
his
eyes
wide
open
and
his
little
nose
carefully
testing
every
merry
little
breeze
who
happened
along
for
any
scent
of
danger
which
it
might
carry
most
of
all
he
depended
upon
his
ears
for
the
grass
was
so
tall
that
he
couldn
t
see
over
it
even
when
he
sat
up
he
had
gone
only
a
little
way
when
he
thought
he
heard
a
queer
rustling
behind
him
he
stopped
to
listen
there
it
was
again
and
it
certainly
was
right
in
the
path
behind
him
he
didn
t
need
to
be
told
who
was
making
it
there
was
only
one
who
could
make
such
a
sound
as
blacksnake
now
danny
can
run
very
fast
along
his
private
little
paths
but
he
knew
that
blacksnake
could
run
faster
if
my
legs
can
t
save
me
my
wits
must
thought
danny
as
he
started
to
run
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
i
must
reach
that
fallen
old
hollow
he
was
almost
out
of
breath
when
he
reached
the
post
and
scurried
into
the
open
end
he
knew
by
the
sound
of
the
rustling
that
blacksnake
was
right
at
his
heels
now
the
old
post
was
hollow
its
whole
length
but
there
was
an
old
just
big
enough
for
danny
to
squeeze
through
blacksnake
didn
t
know
anything
about
that
hole
and
because
it
was
dark
inside
the
old
post
he
didn
t
see
danny
pop
through
it
danny
ran
back
along
the
top
of
the
log
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
tip
of
blacksnake
s
tail
disappear
inside
then
what
do
you
think
danny
did
why
he
followed
blacksnake
right
into
the
old
post
but
in
doing
it
he
didn
t
make
the
least
little
bit
of
noise
blacksnake
kept
right
on
through
the
old
post
and
out
the
other
end
for
he
was
sure
that
that
was
the
way
danny
had
gone
he
kept
right
on
along
the
little
path
now
danny
knew
that
he
wouldn
t
go
very
far
before
he
found
out
that
he
had
been
fooled
and
of
course
he
would
come
back
so
danny
waited
only
long
enough
to
get
his
breath
and
then
ran
back
along
the
path
to
where
another
little
path
branched
off
for
just
a
minute
he
paused
if
blacksnake
follows
me
he
will
be
sure
to
think
that
of
course
i
have
taken
this
other
little
path
thought
danny
so
i
won
t
do
then
he
ran
harder
than
ever
until
he
came
to
a
place
where
two
little
paths
branched
off
one
to
the
right
and
one
to
the
left
he
took
the
latter
and
scampered
on
sure
that
by
this
time
blacksnake
would
be
so
badly
fooled
that
he
would
give
up
the
chase
and
danny
was
right
brains
are
better
far
than
speed
as
wise
men
long
ago
agreed
said
danny
as
he
trotted
on
his
way
for
the
he
liked
so
well
i
felt
it
in
my
bones
that
this
would
be
an
exciting
day
i
wonder
what
xxii
what
happened
next
to
danny
meadow
mouse
danny
is
so
used
to
narrow
escapes
that
he
doesn
t
waste
any
time
thinking
about
them
he
didn
t
this
time
he
who
tries
to
look
two
ways
at
once
is
pretty
sure
to
see
nothing
says
danny
and
he
knew
that
if
he
thought
too
much
about
the
things
that
had
already
happened
he
couldn
t
keep
a
sharp
watch
for
the
things
that
might
happen
nothing
more
happened
as
he
hurried
along
his
private
little
path
to
the
edge
of
a
great
patch
of
grass
so
short
that
he
couldn
t
hide
under
it
he
had
got
to
cross
this
and
all
the
way
he
would
be
in
plain
sight
of
any
one
who
happened
to
be
near
very
cautiously
he
peeped
out
and
looked
this
way
and
looked
that
way
not
forgetting
to
look
up
in
the
sky
he
could
see
no
one
anywhere
drawing
a
long
breath
danny
started
across
the
open
place
as
fast
as
his
short
legs
could
take
him
illustration
with
another
frightened
squeak
danny
dived
into
the
opening
just
in
time
now
all
the
time
redtail
the
hawk
had
been
sitting
in
a
tree
some
distance
away
sitting
so
still
that
he
looked
like
a
part
of
the
tree
itself
that
is
why
danny
hadn
t
seen
him
but
redtail
saw
danny
the
instant
he
started
across
the
open
place
for
redtail
s
eyes
are
very
keen
and
he
can
see
a
great
distance
with
a
satisfied
chuckle
he
spread
his
broad
wings
and
started
after
danny
just
about
to
the
safety
of
the
long
grass
on
the
other
side
danny
gave
a
hurried
look
behind
him
and
his
heart
seemed
to
jump
right
into
his
mouth
for
there
was
redtail
with
his
cruel
claws
already
set
to
seize
him
danny
gave
a
frightened
squeak
for
he
thought
that
surely
this
time
he
would
be
caught
but
he
didn
t
mean
to
give
up
without
trying
to
escape
three
jumps
ahead
of
him
was
a
queer
looking
thing
he
didn
t
know
what
it
was
but
if
there
was
a
hole
in
it
he
might
yet
fool
redtail
one
jump
would
he
be
able
to
reach
it
two
jumps
there
a
hole
in
it
three
jumps
with
another
frightened
squeak
danny
dived
into
the
opening
just
in
time
and
what
do
you
think
he
was
in
why
an
old
tomato
can
farmer
brown
s
boy
had
once
used
to
carry
bait
in
when
he
went
fishing
at
the
smiling
pool
he
had
dropped
it
there
on
his
way
home
redtail
screamed
with
rage
and
disappointment
as
he
struck
the
old
can
with
his
great
claws
he
had
been
sure
very
sure
of
danny
meadow
mouse
this
time
he
tried
to
pick
the
can
up
but
he
couldn
t
get
hold
of
it
it
just
rolled
away
from
him
every
time
try
as
he
would
finally
in
disgust
he
gave
up
and
flew
back
to
the
tree
from
which
he
had
first
seen
danny
of
course
danny
had
been
terribly
frightened
when
the
can
rolled
and
by
the
noise
the
claws
of
redtail
made
when
they
struck
his
queer
but
he
wisely
decided
that
the
best
thing
he
could
do
was
to
stay
there
for
a
while
and
it
was
very
fortunate
that
he
did
so
as
he
was
very
soon
to
find
out
xxiii
reddy
fox
grows
curious
danny
meadow
mouse
had
sat
perfectly
still
for
a
long
time
inside
the
old
tomato
can
in
which
he
had
found
a
refuge
from
redtail
the
hawk
he
didn
t
dare
so
much
as
put
his
head
out
for
a
look
around
lest
redtail
should
be
circling
overhead
ready
to
pounce
on
him
if
i
stay
here
long
enough
he
ll
get
tired
and
go
away
if
he
hasn
t
already
thought
danny
this
has
been
a
pretty
exciting
morning
so
far
and
i
find
that
i
am
a
little
tired
i
may
as
well
take
a
nap
while
i
am
waiting
to
make
sure
that
the
way
is
with
that
danny
curled
up
in
the
old
tomato
can
but
it
wasn
t
meant
that
danny
should
have
that
nap
he
had
closed
his
eyes
but
his
ears
were
still
open
and
presently
he
heard
soft
footsteps
drawing
near
his
eyes
flew
open
and
he
forgot
all
about
sleep
you
may
be
sure
for
those
footsteps
sounded
familiar
they
sounded
to
danny
very
very
much
like
the
footsteps
do
you
think
why
reddy
fox
danny
s
heart
began
to
beat
faster
as
he
listened
could
it
be
he
didn
t
dare
peep
out
presently
a
little
whiff
of
scent
blew
into
the
old
tomato
can
then
danny
reddy
fox
oh
dear
i
hope
he
doesn
t
find
that
i
am
in
here
thought
danny
i
wonder
what
under
the
sun
has
brought
him
up
here
just
if
the
truth
were
to
be
known
it
was
curiosity
that
had
brought
reddy
up
there
reddy
had
been
hunting
for
his
breakfast
some
distance
away
on
the
green
meadows
when
redtail
the
hawk
had
tried
so
hard
to
catch
danny
meadow
mouse
reddy
s
sharp
eyes
had
seen
redtail
the
minute
he
left
the
tree
in
pursuit
of
danny
and
he
had
known
by
the
way
redtail
flew
that
he
saw
something
he
wanted
to
catch
he
had
watched
redtail
swoop
down
and
had
heard
his
scream
of
rage
when
he
missed
danny
because
danny
had
dodged
into
the
old
tomato
can
he
had
seen
redtail
strike
and
strike
again
at
something
on
the
ground
and
finally
fly
off
in
disgust
with
empty
claws
now
i
wonder
what
it
was
redtail
was
after
and
why
he
didn
t
get
it
thought
reddy
he
acts
terribly
put
out
and
disappointed
i
believe
i
ll
go
over
there
and
find
off
he
started
at
a
smart
trot
towards
the
patch
of
short
grass
where
he
had
seen
redtail
the
hawk
striking
at
something
on
the
ground
as
he
drew
near
he
crept
very
softly
until
he
reached
the
very
edge
of
the
open
patch
there
he
stopped
and
looked
sharply
all
over
it
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
an
old
tomato
can
reddy
had
seen
it
many
times
before
now
what
under
the
sun
could
redtail
have
been
after
here
thought
reddy
the
grass
isn
t
long
enough
for
a
grasshopper
to
hide
in
and
yet
redtail
didn
t
get
what
he
was
after
it
s
very
queer
it
certainly
is
very
he
trotted
out
and
began
to
run
back
and
forth
with
his
nose
to
the
ground
hoping
that
his
nose
would
tell
him
what
his
eyes
couldn
t
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
he
ran
and
then
suddenly
he
stopped
ha
exclaimed
reddy
he
had
found
the
scent
left
by
danny
meadow
mouse
when
he
ran
across
towards
the
old
tomato
can
right
up
to
the
old
can
reddy
s
nose
led
him
he
hopped
over
the
old
can
but
on
the
other
side
he
could
find
no
scent
of
danny
meadow
mouse
in
a
flash
he
understood
and
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
shone
in
his
yellow
eyes
as
he
turned
back
to
the
old
can
he
knew
that
danny
must
be
hiding
in
there
i
ve
got
you
this
time
he
snarled
as
he
sniffed
at
the
opening
in
the
end
of
the
can
xxiv
reddy
fox
loses
his
temper
reddy
fox
had
caught
danny
meadow
mouse
and
yet
he
hadn
t
caught
him
he
had
found
danny
hiding
in
the
old
tomato
can
and
it
didn
t
enter
reddy
s
head
that
he
couldn
t
get
danny
out
when
he
wanted
to
he
was
in
no
hurry
he
had
had
a
pretty
good
breakfast
of
grasshoppers
and
so
he
thought
he
would
torment
danny
a
while
before
gobbling
him
up
he
lay
down
so
that
he
could
peep
in
at
the
open
end
of
the
old
can
and
see
danny
trying
to
make
himself
as
small
as
possible
at
the
other
end
reddy
grinned
until
he
showed
all
his
long
teeth
reddy
always
is
a
bully
especially
when
his
victim
is
a
great
deal
smaller
and
weaker
than
himself
i
ve
got
you
this
time
smarty
haven
t
i
taunted
reddy
danny
didn
t
say
anything
you
think
you
ve
been
very
clever
because
you
have
fooled
me
two
or
three
times
don
t
you
well
this
time
i
ve
got
you
where
your
tricks
won
t
work
continued
reddy
so
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
danny
didn
t
answer
the
fact
is
he
was
too
frightened
to
answer
besides
he
didn
t
know
what
he
could
do
so
he
just
kept
still
but
his
bright
eyes
never
once
left
reddy
s
cruel
face
for
all
his
fright
danny
was
doing
some
hard
thinking
he
had
been
in
tight
places
before
and
had
learned
never
to
give
up
hope
something
might
happen
to
frighten
reddy
away
anyway
reddy
had
got
to
get
him
out
of
that
old
can
before
he
would
admit
that
he
was
really
caught
for
a
long
time
reddy
lay
there
licking
his
chops
and
saying
all
the
things
he
could
think
of
to
frighten
poor
danny
meadow
mouse
at
last
he
grew
tired
of
this
and
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
time
to
end
it
and
danny
meadow
mouse
at
the
same
time
he
thrust
his
sharp
nose
in
at
the
opening
in
the
end
of
the
old
can
but
the
opening
was
too
small
for
him
to
get
more
than
his
nose
in
and
he
only
scratched
it
on
the
sharp
edges
without
so
much
as
touching
danny
i
ll
pull
you
out
said
reddy
and
thrust
in
one
black
paw
danny
promptly
bit
it
so
hard
that
reddy
yelped
with
pain
and
pulled
it
out
in
a
hurry
presently
he
tried
again
with
the
other
paw
danny
bit
this
one
harder
still
and
reddy
danced
with
pain
and
anger
then
he
lost
his
temper
completely
a
very
foolish
thing
to
do
as
it
always
is
he
hit
the
old
can
and
away
it
rolled
with
danny
meadow
mouse
inside
this
seemed
to
make
reddy
angrier
than
ever
he
sprang
after
it
and
hit
it
again
then
he
batted
it
first
this
way
and
then
that
way
growing
angrier
and
angrier
and
all
the
time
danny
meadow
mouse
managed
to
keep
inside
although
he
got
a
terrible
shaking
up
back
and
forth
across
the
patch
of
short
grass
reddy
knocked
the
old
can
and
he
was
in
such
a
rage
that
he
didn
t
notice
where
he
was
knocking
it
to
finally
he
sent
it
spinning
into
the
long
grass
on
the
far
side
of
the
open
patch
close
to
one
of
danny
s
private
little
paths
like
a
flash
danny
was
out
and
scurrying
along
the
little
path
he
dodged
into
another
and
presently
into
a
third
which
brought
him
to
a
tangle
of
barbed
wire
left
there
by
farmer
brown
when
he
had
built
a
new
fence
under
this
he
was
safe
phew
exclaimed
danny
breathing
very
hard
that
was
the
narrowest
escape
yet
but
i
guess
i
ll
get
that
special
i
started
out
for
after
and
he
did
while
to
this
day
reddy
fox
wonders
how
danny
got
out
of
the
old
tomato
can
without
him
knowing
it
and
so
you
see
what
temper
does
for
those
who
give
it
rein
it
cheats
them
of
the
very
thing
they
seek
so
hard
to
gain
danny
has
had
many
more
adventures
but
there
isn
t
room
to
tell
about
them
here
besides
grandfather

is
anxious
that
