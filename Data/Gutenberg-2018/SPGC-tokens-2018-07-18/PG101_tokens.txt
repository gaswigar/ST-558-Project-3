hi
i
bruce
sterling
the
author
of
this
electronic
book
out
in
the
traditional
world
of
print
the
hacker
crackdown
is
isbn
and
is
formally
catalogued
by
the
library
of
congress
as
computer
crimes
united
states
telephone
united
states

practices
programming
electronic
computers
united
states
corrupt
practices
practices
i
always
get
a
kick
out
of
that
description
librarians
are
very
ingenious
people
the
paperback
is
isbn
if
you
go
and
buy
a
print
version
of
the
hacker
crackdown
an
action
i
encourage
heartily
you
may
notice
that
in
the
front
of
the
book
beneath
the
copyright
notice
copyright
c
by
bruce
sterling
it
has
this
little
block
of
printed
legal
boilerplate
from
the
publisher
it
says
and
i
quote
no
part
of
this
book
may
be
reproduced
or
transmitted
in
any
form
or
by
any
means
electronic
or
mechanical
including
photocopying
recording
or
by
any
information
storage
and
retrieval
system
without
permission
in
writing
from
the
publisher
for
information
address
bantam
books
this
is
a
pretty
good
disclaimer
as
such
disclaimers
go
i
collect
disclaimers
and
i
seen
dozens
of
them
and
this
one
is
at
least
pretty
straightforward
in
this
narrow
and
particular
case
however
it
is
quite
accurate
bantam
books
puts
that
disclaimer
on
every
book
they
publish
but
bantam
books
does
not
in
fact
own
the
electronic
rights
to
this
book
i
do
because
of
certain
extensive
contract
maneuverings
my
agent
and
i
went
through
before
this
book
was
written
i
want
to
give
those
electronic
publishing
rights
away
through
certain
channels
and
i
convinced
bantam
that
this
is
a
good
idea
since
bantam
has
seen
fit
to
peacably
agree
to
this
scheme
of
mine
bantam
books
is
not
going
to
fuss
about
this
provided
you
do
try
to
sell
the
book
they
are
not
going
to
bother
you
for
what
you
do
with
the
electronic
copy
of
this
book
if
you
want
to
check
this
out
personally
you
can
ask
them
they
at
broadway
ny
ny
however
if
you
were
so
foolish
as
to
print
this
book
and
start
retailing
it
for
money
in
violation
of
my
copyright
and
the
commercial
interests
of
bantam
books
then
bantam
a
part
of
the
gigantic
bertelsmann
multinational
publishing
combine
would
roust
some
of
their
attorneys
out
of
hibernation
and
crush
you
like
a
bug
this
is
only
to
be
expected
i
did
write
this
book
so
that
you
could
make
money
out
of
it
if
anybody
is
gon
na
make
money
out
of
this
book
it
gon
na
be
me
and
my
publisher
my
publisher
deserves
to
make
money
out
of
this
book
not
only
did
the
folks
at
bantam
books
commission
me
to
write
the
book
and
pay
me
a
hefty
sum
to
do
so
but
they
bravely
printed
in
text
an
electronic
document
the
reproduction
of
which
was
once
alleged
to
be
a
federal
felony
bantam
books
and
their
numerous
attorneys
were
very
brave
and
forthright
about
this
book
furthermore
my
former
editor
at
bantam
books
betsy
mitchell
genuinely
cared
about
this
project
and
worked
hard
on
it
and
had
a
lot
of
wise
things
to
say
about
the
manuscript
betsy
deserves
genuine
credit
for
this
book
credit
that
editors
too
rarely
get
the
critics
were
very
kind
to
the
hacker
crackdown
and
commercially
the
book
has
done
well
on
the
other
hand
i
did
write
this
book
in
order
to
squeeze
every
last
nickel
and
dime
out
of
the
mitts
of
impoverished
cyberpunk
teenagers
do
have
any
money
no
not
even
enough
for
the
hacker
crackdown
paperback
with
its
attractive
cover
and
useful
index
that
a
major
reason
why
teenagers
sometimes
succumb
to
the
temptation
to
do
things
they
should
such
as
swiping
my
books
out
of
libraries
kids
this
one
is
all
yours
all
right
go
give
the
print
version
back
civil
libertarians
do
have
much
money
either
and
it
seems
almost
criminal
to
snatch
cash
out
of
the
hands
of
america
direly
underpaid
electronic
law
enforcement
community
if
you
a
computer
cop
a
hacker
or
an
electronic
civil
liberties
activist
you
are
the
target
audience
for
this
book
i
wrote
this
book
because
i
wanted
to
help
you
and
help
other
people
understand
you
and
your
unique
uhm
problems
i
wrote
this
book
to
aid
your
activities
and
to
contribute
to
the
public
discussion
of
important
political
issues
in
giving
the
text
away
in
this
fashion
i
am
directly
contributing
to
the
book
ultimate
aim
to
help
civilize
cyberspace
information
wants
to
be
free
and
the
information
inside
this
book
longs
for
freedom
with
a
peculiar
intensity
i
genuinely
believe
that
the
natural
habitat
of
this
book
is
inside
an
electronic
network
that
may
not
be
the
easiest
direct
method
to
generate
revenue
for
the
book
author
but
that
does
matter
this
is
where
this
book
belongs
by
its
nature
i
written
other
books
plenty
of
other
books
and
i
write
more
and
i
am
writing
more
but
this
one
is
special
i
am
making
the
hacker
crackdown
available
electronically
as
widely
as
i
can
conveniently
manage
and
if
you
like
the
book
and
think
it
is
useful
then
i
urge
you
to
do
the
same
with
it
you
can
copy
this
electronic
book
copy
the
heck
out
of
it
be
my
guest
and
give
those
copies
to
anybody
who
wants
them
the
nascent
world
of
cyberspace
is
full
of
sysadmins
teachers
trainers
cybrarians
netgurus
and
various
species
of
cybernetic
activist
if
you
one
of
those
people
i
know
about
you
and
i
know
the
hassle
you
go
through
to
try
to
help
people
learn
about
the
electronic
frontier
i
hope
that
possessing
this
book
in
electronic
form
will
lessen
your
troubles
granted
this
treatment
of
our
electronic
social
spectrum
is
not
the
ultimate
in
academic
rigor
and
politically
it
has
something
to
offend
and
trouble
almost
everyone
but
hey
i
told
it
readable
and
at
least
the
price
is
right
you
can
upload
the
book
onto
bulletin
board
systems
or
internet
nodes
or
electronic
discussion
groups
go
right
ahead
and
do
that
i
am
giving
you
express
permission
right
now
enjoy
yourself
you
can
put
the
book
on
disks
and
give
the
disks
away
as
long
as
you
do
take
any
money
for
it
but
this
book
is
not
public
domain
you
ca
copyright
it
in
your
own
name
i
own
the
copyright
attempts
to
pirate
this
book
and
make
money
from
selling
it
may
involve
you
in
a
serious
litigative
snarl
believe
me
for
the
pittance
you
might
wring
out
of
such
an
action
it
really
not
worth
it
this
book
do
belong
to
you
in
an
odd
but
very
genuine
way
i
feel
it
does
belong
to
me
either
it
a
book
about
the
people
of
cyberspace
and
distributing
it
in
this
way
is
the
best
way
i
know
to
actually
make
this
information
available
freely
and
easily
to
all
the
people
of
cyberspace
including
people
far
outside
the
borders
of
the
united
states
who
otherwise
may
never
have
a
chance
to
see
any
edition
of
the
book
and
who
may
perhaps
learn
something
useful
from
this
strange
story
of
distant
obscure
but
portentous
events
in
american
cyberspace
this
electronic
book
is
now
literary
freeware
it
now
belongs
to
the
emergent
realm
of
alternative
information
economics
you
have
no
right
to
make
this
electronic
book
part
of
the
conventional
flow
of
commerce
let
it
be
part
of
the
flow
of
knowledge
there
a
difference
i
divided
the
book
into
four
sections
so
that
it
is
less
ungainly
for
upload
and
download
if
there
a
section
of
particular
relevance
to
you
and
your
colleagues
feel
free
to
reproduce
that
one
and
skip
the
rest
project
gutenberg
has
reassembled
the
file
with
sterling
permission
just
make
more
when
you
need
them
and
give
them
to
whoever
might
want
them
now
have
fun

this

about
cops

teenage
and

and
anarchists
and
industrial

and
hippies
and
millionaires
and
game
hobbyists
and
computer
security
experts
and
secret
service
agents
and
grifters
and
thieves
this
book
is
about
the
electronic
frontier
of
the
it
concerns
activities
that
take
place
inside
computers
and
over
telephone
lines
a
science
fiction
writer
coined
the
useful
term
cyberspace
in
but
the
territory
in
question
the
electronic
frontier
is
about
a
hundred
and
thirty
years
old
cyberspace
is
the
place
where
a
telephone
conversation
appears
to
occur
not
inside
your
actual
phone
the
plastic
device
on
your
desk
not
inside
the
other
person
phone
in
some
other
city
the
place
between
the
phones
the
indefinite
place
out
there
where
the
two
of
you
two
human
beings
actually
meet
and
communicate
although
it
is
not
exactly
real
cyberspace
is
a
genuine
place
things
happen
there
that
have
very
genuine
consequences
this
place
is
not
real
but
it
is
serious
it
is
earnest
tens
of
thousands
of
people
have
dedicated
their
lives
to
it
to
the
public
service
of
public
communication
by
wire
and
electronics
people
have
worked
on
this
frontier
for
generations
now
some
people
became
rich
and
famous
from
their
efforts
there
some
just
played
in
it
as
hobbyists
others
soberly
pondered
it
and
wrote
about
it
and
regulated
it
and
negotiated
over
it
in
international
forums
and
sued
one
another
about
it
in
gigantic
epic
court
battles
that
lasted
for
years
and
almost
since
the
beginning
some
people
have
committed
crimes
in
this
place
but
in
the
past
twenty
years
this
electrical
space
which
was
once
thin
and
dark
and
little
more
than
a
narrow
stretching
from
phone
to
phone
has
flung
itself
open
like
a
gigantic
light
has
flooded
upon
it
the
eerie
light
of
the
glowing
computer
screen
this
dark
electric
netherworld
has
become
a
vast
flowering
electronic
landscape
since
the
the
world
of
the
telephone
has
itself
with
computers
and
television
and
though
there
is
still
no
substance
to
cyberspace
nothing
you
can
handle
it
has
a
strange
kind
of
physicality
now
it
makes
good
sense
today
to
talk
of
cyberspace
as
a
place
all
its
own
because
people
live
in
it
now
not
just
a
few
people
not
just
a
few
technicians
and
eccentrics
but
thousands
of
people
quite
normal
people
and
not
just
for
a
little
while
either
but
for
hours
straight
over
weeks
and
months
and
years
cyberspace
today
is
a
net
a
matrix
international
in
scope
and
growing
swiftly
and
steadily
it
growing
in
size
and
wealth
and
political
importance
people
are
making
entire
careers
in
modern
cyberspace
scientists
and
technicians
of
course
they
been
there
for
twenty
years
now
but
increasingly
cyberspace
is
filling
with
journalists
and
doctors
and
lawyers
and
artists
and
clerks
civil
servants
make
their
careers
there
now
in
vast
government
and
so
do
spies
industrial
political
and
just
plain
snoops
and
so
do
police
at
least
a
few
of
them
and
there
are
children
living
there
now
people
have
met
there
and
been
married
there
there
are
entire
living
communities
in
cyberspace
today
chattering
gossiping
planning
conferring
and
scheming
leaving
one
another
and
electronic
mail
giving
one
another
big
weightless
chunks
of
valuable
data
both
legitimate
and
illegitimate
they
busily
pass
one
another
computer
software
and
the
occasional
festering
computer
virus
we
do
not
really
understand
how
to
live
in
cyberspace
yet
we
are
feeling
our
way
into
it
blundering
about
that
is
not
surprising
our
lives
in
the
physical
world
the
real
world
are
also
far
from
perfect
despite
a
lot
more
practice
human
lives
real
lives
are
imperfect
by
their
nature
and
there
are
human
beings
in
cyberspace
the
way
we
live
in
cyberspace
is
a
funhouse
mirror
of
the
way
we
live
in
the
real
world
we
take
both
our
advantages
and
our
troubles
with
us
this
book
is
about
trouble
in
cyberspace
specifically
this
book
is
about
certain
strange
events
in
the
year
an
unprecedented
and
startling
year
for
the
the
growing
world
of
computerized
communications
in
there
came
a
nationwide
crackdown
on
illicit
computer
hackers
with
arrests
criminal
charges
one
dramatic
several
guilty
pleas
and
huge
confiscations
of
data
and
equipment
all
over
the
usa
the
hacker
crackdown
of
was
larger
better
organized
more
deliberate
and
more
resolute
than
any
previous
effort
in
the
brave
new
world
of
computer
crime
the
secret
service
private
telephone
security
and
state
and
local
law
enforcement
groups
across
the
country
all
joined
forces
in
a
determined
attempt
to
break
the
back
of
america
electronic
underground
it
was
a
fascinating
effort
with
very
mixed
results
the
hacker
crackdown
had
another
unprecedented
effect
it
spurred
the
creation
within
the
computer
community
of
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
a
new
and
very
odd
interest
group
fiercely
dedicated
to
the
establishment
and
preservation
of
electronic
civil
liberties
the
crackdown
remarkable
in
itself
has
created
a
melee
of
debate
over
electronic
crime
punishment
freedom
of
the
press
and
issues
of
search
and
seizure
politics
has
entered
cyberspace
where
people
go
politics
follow
this
is
the
story
of
the
people
of
cyberspace
part
one
crashing
the
system
on
january
at
t
telephone
switching
system
crashed
this
was
a
strange
dire
huge
event
sixty
thousand
people
lost
their
telephone
service
completely
during
the
nine
long
hours
of
frantic
effort
that
it
took
to
restore
service
some
seventy
million
telephone
calls
went
uncompleted
losses
of
service
known
as
outages
in
the
telco
trade
are
a
known
and
accepted
hazard
of
the
telephone
business
hurricanes
hit
and
phone
cables
get
snapped
by
the
thousands
earthquakes
wrench
through
buried
lines
switching
stations
catch
fire
and
burn
to
the
ground
these
things
do
happen
there
are
contingency
plans
for
them
and
decades
of
experience
in
dealing
with
them
but
the
crash
of
january
was
unprecedented
it
was
unbelievably
huge
and
it
occurred
for
no
apparent
physical
reason
the
crash
started
on
a
monday
afternoon
in
a
single
in
manhattan
but
unlike
any
merely
physical
damage
it
spread
and
spread
station
after
station
across
america
collapsed
in
a
chain
reaction
until
fully
half
of
at
t
network
had
gone
haywire
and
the
remaining
half
was
to
handle
the
overflow
within
nine
hours
at
t
software
engineers
more
or
less
understood
what
had
caused
the
crash
replicating
the
problem
exactly
poring
over
software
line
by
line
took
them
a
couple
of
weeks
but
because
it
was
hard
to
understand
technically
the
full
truth
of
the
matter
and
its
implications
were
not
widely
and
thoroughly
aired
and
explained
the
root
cause
of
the
crash
remained
obscure
surrounded
by
rumor
and
fear
the
crash
was
a
grave
corporate
embarrassment
the
culprit
was
a
bug
in
at
t
own
software
not
the
sort
of
admission
the
telecommunications
giant
wanted
to
make
especially
in
the
face
of
increasing
competition
still
the
truth
was
told
in
the
baffling
technical
terms
necessary
to
explain
it
somehow
the
explanation
failed
to
persuade
american
law
enforcement
officials
and
even
telephone
corporate
security
personnel
these
people
were
not
technical
experts
or
software
wizards
and
they
had
their
own
suspicions
about
the
cause
of
this
disaster
the
police
and
telco
security
had
important
sources
of
information
denied
to
mere
software
engineers
they
had
informants
in
the
computer
underground
and
years
of
experience
in
dealing
with
rascality
that
seemed
to
grow
ever
more
sophisticated
for
years
they
had
been
expecting
a
direct
and
savage
attack
against
the
american
national
telephone
system
and
with
the
crash
of
january
the
first
month
of
a
new
decade
their
predictions
fears
and
suspicions
seemed
at
last
to
have
entered
the
real
world
a
world
where
the
telephone
system
had
not
merely
crashed
but
quite
likely
been
crashed
by
hackers
the
crash
created
a
large
dark
cloud
of
suspicion
that
would
color
certain
people
assumptions
and
actions
for
months
the
fact
that
it
took
place
in
the
realm
of
software
was
suspicious
on
its
face
the
fact
that
it
occurred
on
martin
luther
king
day
still
the
most
politically
touchy
of
american
holidays
made
it
more
suspicious
yet
the
crash
of
january
gave
the
hacker
crackdown
its
sense
of
edge
and
its
sweaty
urgency
it
made
people
powerful
people
in
positions
of
public
authority
willing
to
believe
the
worst
and
most
fatally
it
helped
to
give
investigators
a
willingness
to
take
extreme
measures
and
the
determination
to
preserve
almost
total
secrecy
an
obscure
software
fault
in
an
aging
switching
system
in
new
york
was
to
lead
to
a
chain
reaction
of
legal
and
constitutional
trouble
all
across
the
country
like
the
crash
in
the
telephone
system
this
chain
reaction
was
ready
and
waiting
to
happen
during
the
the
american
legal
system
was
extensively
patched
to
deal
with
the
novel
issues
of
computer
crime
there
was
for
instance
the
electronic
communications
privacy
act
of
eloquently
described
as
a
stinking
mess
by
a
prominent
law
enforcement
official
and
there
was
the
draconian
computer
fraud
and
abuse
act
of
passed
unanimously
by
the
united
states
senate
which
later
would
reveal
a
large
number
of
flaws
extensive
efforts
had
been
made
to
keep
the
legal
system
up
to
date
but
in
the
grind
of
the
real
world
even
the
most
elegant
software
tends
to
crumble
and
suddenly
reveal
its
hidden
bugs
like
the
advancing
telephone
system
the
american
legal
system
was
certainly
not
ruined
by
its
temporary
crash
but
for
those
caught
under
the
weight
of
the
collapsing
system
life
became
a
series
of
blackouts
and
anomalies
in
order
to
understand
why
these
weird
events
occurred
both
in
the
world
of
technology
and
in
the
world
of
law
it
not
enough
to
understand
the
merely
technical
problems
we
will
get
to
those
but
first
and
foremost
we
must
try
to
understand
the
telephone
and
the
business
of
telephones
and
the
community
of
human
beings
that
telephones
have
created
technologies
have
life
cycles
like
cities
do
like
institutions
do
like
laws
and
governments
do
the
first
stage
of
any
technology
is
the
question
mark
often
known
as
the
golden
vaporware
stage
at
this
early
point
the
technology
is
only
a
phantom
a
mere
gleam
in
the
inventor
eye
one
such
inventor
was
a
speech
teacher
and
electrical
tinkerer
named
alexander
graham
bell
bell
early
inventions
while
ingenious
failed
to
move
the
world
in
the
teenage
bell
and
his
brother
melville
made
an
artificial
talking
mechanism
out
of
wood
rubber
and
tin
this
weird
device
had
a
tongue
made
of
movable
wooden
segments
with
vibrating
rubber
vocal
cords
and
rubber
lips
and
cheeks
while
melville
puffed
a
bellows
into
a
tin
tube
imitating
the
lungs
young
alec
bell
would
manipulate
the
lips
teeth
and
tongue
causing
the
thing
to
emit
falsetto
gibberish
another
technical
breakthrough
was
the
bell
phonautograph
of
actually
made
out
of
a
human
cadaver
ear
clamped
into
place
on
a
tripod
this
grisly
gadget
drew
images
on
smoked
glass
through
a
thin
straw
glued
to
its
vibrating
earbones
by
bell
had
learned
to
produce
audible
sounds
ugly
shrieks
and
squawks
by
using
magnets
diaphragms
and
electrical
current
most
golden
vaporware
technologies
go
nowhere
but
the
second
stage
of
technology
is
the
rising
star
or
the
goofy
prototype
stage
the
telephone
most
ambitious
gadget
yet
reached
this
stage
on
march
on
that
great
day
alexander
graham
bell
became
the
first
person
to
transmit
intelligible
human
speech
electrically
as
it
happened
young
professor
bell
industriously
tinkering
in
his
boston
lab
had
spattered
his
trousers
with
acid
his
assistant
watson
heard
his
cry
for
help
over
bell
experimental
this
was
an
event
without
precedent
technologies
in
their
goofy
prototype
stage
rarely
work
very
well
they
experimental
and
therefore
baked
and
rather
frazzled
the
prototype
may
be
attractive
and
novel
and
it
does
look
as
if
it
ought
to
be
good
for
but
nobody
including
the
inventor
is
quite
sure
what
inventors
and
speculators
and
pundits
may
have
very
firm
ideas
about
its
potential
use
but
those
ideas
are
often
very
wrong
the
natural
habitat
of
the
goofy
prototype
is
in
trade
shows
and
in
the
popular
press
infant
technologies
need
publicity
and
investment
money
like
a
tottering
calf
need
milk
this
was
very
true
of
bell
machine
to
raise
research
and
development
money
bell
toured
with
his
device
as
a
stage
attraction
contemporary
press
reports
of
the
stage
debut
of
the
telephone
showed
pleased
astonishment
mixed
with
considerable
dread
bell
stage
telephone
was
a
large
wooden
box
with
a
crude
the
whole
contraption
about
the
size
and
shape
of
an
overgrown
brownie
camera
its
buzzing
steel
soundplate
pumped
up
by
powerful
electromagnets
was
loud
enough
to
fill
an
auditorium
bell
assistant
watson
who
could
manage
on
the
keyboards
fairly
well
kicked
in
by
playing
the
organ
from
distant
rooms
and
later
distant
cities
this
feat
was
considered
marvellous
but
very
eerie
indeed
bell
original
notion
for
the
telephone
an
idea
promoted
for
a
couple
of
years
was
that
it
would
become
a
mass
medium
we
might
recognize
bell
idea
today
as
something
close
to
modern
cable
radio
telephones
at
a
central
source
would
transmit
music
sunday
sermons
and
important
public
speeches
to
a
paying
network
of
subscribers
at
the
time
most
people
thought
this
notion
made
good
sense
in
fact
bell
idea
was
workable
in
hungary
this
philosophy
of
the
telephone
was
successfully
put
into
everyday
practice
in
budapest
for
decades
from
until
after
world
war
i
there
was
a
information
service
called
telefon
was
a
centralized
source
of
news
and
entertainment
and
culture
including
stock
reports
plays
concerts
and
novels
read
aloud
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
the
phone
would
ring
you
would
plug
in
a
loudspeaker
for
the
use
of
the
family
and
telefon
would
be
on
the
air
or
rather
on
the
phone
is
dead
tech
today
but
might
be
considered
a
spiritual
ancestor
of
the
modern
computer
data
services
such
as
compuserve
genie
or
prodigy
the
principle
behind
is
also
not
too
far
from
computer
board
systems
or
bbs
which
arrived
in
the
late
spread
rapidly
across
america
and
will
figure
largely
in
this
book
we
are
used
to
using
telephones
for
individual
speech
because
we
are
used
to
the
bell
system
but
this
was
just
one
possibility
among
many
communication
networks
are
very
flexible
and
protean
especially
when
their
hardware
becomes
sufficiently
advanced
they
can
be
put
to
all
kinds
of
uses
and
they
have
been
and
they
will
be
bell
telephone
was
bound
for
glory
but
this
was
a
combination
of
political
decisions
canny
infighting
in
court
inspired
industrial
leadership
receptive
local
conditions
and
outright
good
luck
much
the
same
is
true
of
communications
systems
today
as
bell
and
his
backers
struggled
to
install
their
newfangled
system
in
the
real
world
of
new
england
they
had
to
fight
against
skepticism
and
industrial
rivalry
there
was
already
a
strong
electrical
communications
network
present
in
america
the
telegraph
the
head
of
the
western
union
telegraph
system
dismissed
bell
prototype
as
an
electrical
toy
and
refused
to
buy
the
rights
to
bell
patent
the
telephone
it
seemed
might
be
all
right
as
a
parlor
entertainment
but
not
for
serious
business
telegrams
unlike
mere
telephones
left
a
permanent
physical
record
of
their
messages
telegrams
unlike
telephones
could
be
answered
whenever
the
recipient
had
time
and
convenience
and
the
telegram
had
a
much
longer
than
bell
early
telephone
these
factors
made
telegraphy
seem
a
much
more
sound
and
businesslike
technology
at
least
to
some
the
telegraph
system
was
huge
and
in
the
united
states
had
miles
of
telegraph
wire
and
telegraph
offices
there
were
specialized
telegraphs
for
businesses
and
stock
traders
government
police
and
fire
departments
and
bell
toy
was
best
known
as
a
musical
device
the
third
stage
of
technology
is
known
as
the
cash
cow
stage
in
the
cash
cow
stage
a
technology
finds
its
place
in
the
world
and
matures
and
becomes
settled
and
productive
after
a
year
or
so
alexander
graham
bell
and
his
capitalist
backers
concluded
that
eerie
music
piped
from
cyberspace
was
not
the
real
of
his
invention
instead
the
telephone
was
about
speech
individual
personal
speech
the
human
voice
human
conversation
and
human
interaction
the
telephone
was
not
to
be
managed
from
any
centralized
broadcast
center
it
was
to
be
a
personal
intimate
technology
when
you
picked
up
a
telephone
you
were
not
absorbing
the
cold
output
of
a
machine
you
were
speaking
to
another
human
being
once
people
realized
this
their
instinctive
dread
of
the
telephone
as
an
eerie
unnatural
device
swiftly
vanished
a
telephone
call
was
not
a
call
from
a
telephone
itself
but
a
call
from
another
human
being
someone
you
would
generally
know
and
recognize
the
real
point
was
not
what
the
machine
could
do
for
you
or
to
you
but
what
you
yourself
a
person
and
citizen
could
do
through
the
machine
this
decision
on
the
part
of
the
young
bell
company
was
absolutely
vital
the
first
telephone
networks
went
up
around
boston
mostly
among
the
technically
curious
and
the
much
the
same
segment
of
the
american
populace
that
a
hundred
years
later
would
be
buying
personal
computers
entrenched
backers
of
the
telegraph
continued
to
scoff
but
in
january
a
disaster
made
the
telephone
famous
a
train
crashed
in
tarriffville
connecticut
doctors
in
the
nearby
city
of
hartford
had
had
speaking
telephone
installed
an
alert
local
druggist
was
able
to
telephone
an
entire
community
of
local
doctors
who
rushed
to
the
site
to
give
aid
the
disaster
as
disasters
do
aroused
intense
press
coverage
the
phone
had
proven
its
usefulness
in
the
real
world
after
tarriffville
the
telephone
network
spread
like
crabgrass
by
it
was
all
over
new
england
by
out
to
chicago
by
into
minnesota
nebraska
and
texas
by
it
was
all
over
the
continent
the
telephone
had
become
a
mature
technology
professor
bell
now
generally
known
as
bell
despite
his
lack
of
a
formal
degree
became
quite
wealthy
he
lost
interest
in
the
tedious
business
muddle
of
the
booming
telephone
network
and
gratefully
returned
his
attention
to
creatively
in
his
various
laboratories
which
were
now
much
larger
and
gratifyingly
bell
was
never
to
have
another
great
inventive
success
though
his
speculations
and
prototypes
anticipated
transmission
manned
flight
sonar
hydrofoil
ships
tetrahedral
construction
and
montessori
education
the
decibel
the
standard
scientific
measure
of
sound
intensity
was
named
after
bell
not
all
bell
vaporware
notions
were
inspired
he
was
fascinated
by
human
eugenics
he
also
spent
many
years
developing
a
weird
personal
system
of
astrophysics
in
which
gravity
did
not
exist
bell
was
a
definite
eccentric
he
was
something
of
a
hypochondriac
and
throughout
his
life
he
habitually
stayed
up
until
four
refusing
to
rise
before
noon
but
bell
had
accomplished
a
great
feat
he
was
an
idol
of
millions
and
his
influence
wealth
and
great
personal
charm
combined
with
his
eccentricity
made
him
something
of
a
loose
cannon
on
deck
bell
maintained
a
thriving
scientific
salon
in
his
winter
mansion
in
washington
which
gave
him
considerable
backstage
influence
in
governmental
and
scientific
circles
he
was
a
major
financial
backer
of
the
the
magazines
science
and
national
geographic
both
still
flourishing
today
as
important
organs
of
the
american
scientific
establishment
bell
companion
thomas
watson
similarly
wealthy
and
similarly
odd
became
the
ardent
political
disciple
of
a
writer
and
social
reformer
edward
bellamy
watson
also
trod
the
boards
briefly
as
a
shakespearian
actor
there
would
never
be
another
alexander
graham
bell
but
in
years
to
come
there
would
be
surprising
numbers
of
people
like
him
bell
was
a
prototype
of
the
entrepreneur
entrepreneurs
will
play
a
very
prominent
role
in
this
book
not
merely
as
technicians
and
businessmen
but
as
pioneers
of
the
technical
frontier
who
can
carry
the
power
and
prestige
they
derive
from
into
the
political
and
social
arena
like
later
entrepreneurs
bell
was
fierce
in
defense
of
his
own
technological
territory
as
the
telephone
began
to
flourish
bell
was
soon
involved
in
violent
lawsuits
in
the
defense
of
his
patents
bell
boston
lawyers
were
excellent
however
and
bell
himself
as
an
elocution
teacher
and
gifted
public
speaker
was
a
devastatingly
effective
legal
witness
in
the
eighteen
years
of
bell
patents
the
bell
company
was
involved
in
six
hundred
separate
lawsuits
the
legal
records
printed
filled

the

won
every
single
suit
after

exclusive

rival
telephone
companies
sprang
up
all
over
america
bell
company
american
bell
telephone
was
soon
in
deep
trouble
in
american
bell
telephone
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
rather
sinister
morgan
financial
cartel
speculators
who
dominated
wall
street
at
this
point
history
might
have
taken
a
different
turn
american
might
well
have
been
served
forever
by
a
patchwork
of
locally
owned
telephone
companies
many
state
politicians
and
local
businessmen
considered
this
an
excellent
solution
but
the
new
bell
holding
company
american
telephone
and
telegraph
or
at
t
put
in
a
new
man
at
the
helm
a
visionary
industrialist
named
theodore
vail
vail
a
former
post
office
manager
understood
large
organizations
and
had
an
innate
feeling
for
the
nature
of
communications
vail
quickly
saw
to
it
that
at
t
seized
the
technological
edge
once
again
the
pupin
and
campbell
loading
coil
and
the
deforest
audion
are
both
extinct
technology
today
but
in
they
gave
vail
company
the
best
lines
ever
built
by
controlling
the
links
between
and
over
and
above
the
smaller
local
phone
companies
at
t
swiftly
gained
the
over
them
and
was
soon
devouring
them
right
and
left
vail
plowed
the
profits
back
into
research
and
development
starting
the
bell
tradition
of
and
brilliant
industrial
research
technically
and
financially
at
t
gradually
steamrollered
the
opposition
independent
telephone
companies
never
became
entirely
extinct
and
hundreds
of
them
flourish
today
but
vail
at
t
became
the
supreme
communications
company
at
one
point
vail
at
t
bought
western
union
itself
the
very
company
that
had
derided
bell
telephone
as
a
toy
vail
thoroughly
reformed
western
union
hidebound
business
along
his
modern
principles
but
when
the
federal
government
grew
anxious
at
this
centralization
of
power
vail
politely
gave
western
union
back
this
centralizing
process
was
not
unique
very
similar
events
had
happened
in
american
steel
oil
and
railroads
but
at
t
unlike
the
other
companies
was
to
remain
supreme
the
monopoly
of
those
other
industries
were
humbled
and
shattered
by
government
vail
the
former
post
office
official
was
quite
willing
to
accommodate
the
us
government
in
fact
he
would
forge
an
active
alliance
with
it
at
t
would
become
almost
a
wing
of
the
american
government
almost
another
post
office
though
not
quite
at
t
would
willingly
submit
to
federal
regulation
but
in
return
it
would
use
the
government
regulators
as
its
own
police
who
would
keep
out
competitors
and
assure
the
bell
system
profits
and
preeminence
this
was
the
second
birth
the
political
birth
of
the
american
telephone
system
vail
arrangement
was
to
persist
with
vast
success
for
many
decades
until
his
system
was
an
odd
kind
of
american
industrial
socialism
it
was
born
at
about
the
same
time
as
leninist
communism
and
it
lasted
almost
as
long
and
it
must
be
admitted
to
considerably
better
effect
vail
system
worked
except
perhaps
for
aerospace
there
has
been
no
technology
more
thoroughly
dominated
by
americans
than
the
telephone
the
telephone
was
seen
from
the
beginning
as
a
quintessentially
american
technology
bell
policy
and
the
policy
of
theodore
vail
was
a
profoundly
democratic
policy
of
universal
access
vail
famous
corporate
slogan
one
policy
one
system
universal
service
was
a
political
slogan
with
a
very
american
ring
to
it
the
american
telephone
was
not
to
become
the
specialized
tool
of
government
or
business
but
a
general
public
utility
at
first
it
was
true
only
the
wealthy
could
afford
private
telephones
and
bell
company
pursued
the
business
markets
primarily
the
american
phone
system
was
a
capitalist
effort
meant
to
make
money
it
was
not
a
charity
but
from
the
first
almost
all
communities
with
telephone
service
had
public
telephones
and
many
stores
especially
drugstores
offered
public
use
of
their
phones
you
might
not
own
a
telephone
but
you
could
always
get
into
the
system
if
you
really
needed
to
there
was
nothing
inevitable
about
this
decision
to
make
telephones
public
and
universal
vail
system
involved
a
profound
act
of
trust
in
the
public
this
decision
was
a
political
one
informed
by
the
basic
values
of
the
american
republic
the
situation
might
have
been
very
different
and
in
other
countries
under
other
systems
it
certainly
was
joseph
stalin
for
instance
vetoed
plans
for
a
soviet
phone
system
soon
after
the
bolshevik
revolution
stalin
was
certain
that
publicly
accessible
telephones
would
become
instruments
of
counterrevolution
and
conspiracy
he
was
probably
right
when
telephones
did
arrive
in
the
soviet
union
they
would
be
instruments
of
party
authority
and
always
heavily
tapped
alexander
solzhenitsyn
novel
the
first
circle
describes
efforts
to
develop
a
phone
system
more
suited
to
stalinist
purposes
france
with
its
tradition
of
rational
centralized
government
had
fought
bitterly
even
against
the
electric
telegraph
which
seemed
to
the
french
entirely
too
anarchical
and
frivolous
for
decades
france
communicated
via
the
visual
telegraph
a
semaphore
system
of
huge
stone
towers
that
signalled
from
hilltops
across
vast
distances
with
big
arms
in
one
barbay
a
semaphore
enthusiast
memorably
uttered
an
early
version
of
what
might
be
called
the
security
expert
argument
against
the
open
media
no
the
electric
telegraph
is
not
a
sound
invention
it
will
always
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
slightest
disruption
wild
youths
drunkards
bums
etc
the
electric
telegraph
meets
those
destructive
elements
with
only
a
few
meters
of
wire
over
which
supervision
is
impossible
a
single
man
could
without
being
seen
cut
the
telegraph
wires
leading
to
paris
and
in
hours
cut
in
ten
different
places
the
wires
of
the
same
line
without
being
arrested
the
visual
telegraph
on
the
contrary
has
its
towers
its
high
walls
its
gates
from
inside
by
strong
armed
men
yes
i
declare
substitution
of
the
electric
telegraph
for
the
visual
one
is
a
dreadful
measure
a
truly
idiotic
act
barbay
and
his
stone
machines
were
eventually
unsuccessful
but
his
argument
that
communication
exists
for
the
safety
and
convenience
of
the
state
and
must
be
carefully
protected
from
the
wild
boys
and
the
gutter
rabble
who
might
want
to
crash
the
system
would
be
heard
again
and
again
when
the
french
telephone
system
finally
did
arrive
its
snarled
inadequacy
was
to
be
notorious
devotees
of
the
american
bell
system
often
recommended
a
trip
to
france
for
skeptics
in
edwardian
britain
issues
of
class
and
privacy
were
a
for
telephonic
progress
it
was
considered
outrageous
that
anyone
any
wild
fool
off
the
street
could
simply
barge
bellowing
into
one
office
or
home
preceded
only
by
the
ringing
of
a
telephone
bell
in
britain
phones
were
tolerated
for
the
use
of
business
but
private
phones
tended
be
stuffed
away
into
closets
smoking
rooms
or
servants
quarters
telephone
operators
were
resented
in
britain
because
they
did
not
seem
to
know
their
place
and
no
one
of
breeding
would
print
a
telephone
number
on
a
business
card
this
seemed
a
crass
attempt
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
strangers
but
phone
access
in
america
was
to
become
a
popular
right
something
like
universal
suffrage
only
more
so
american
women
could
not
yet
vote
when
the
phone
system
came
through
yet
from
the
beginning
american
women
doted
on
the
telephone
this
feminization
of
the
american
telephone
was
often
commented
on
by
foreigners
phones
in
america
were
not
censored
or
stiff
or
formalized
they
were
social
private
intimate
and
domestic
in
america
mother
day
is
by
far
the
busiest
day
of
the
year
for
the
phone
network
the
early
telephone
companies
and
especially
at
t
were
among
the
foremost
employers
of
american
women
they
employed
the
daughters
of
the
american
in
great
armies
in
eight
thousand
women
by
almost
a
quarter
of
a
million
women
seemed
to
enjoy
telephone
work
it
was
respectable
it
was
steady
it
paid
fairly
well
as
women
work
went
and
not
least
it
seemed
a
genuine
contribution
to
the
social
good
of
the
community
women
found
vail
ideal
of
public
service
attractive
this
was
especially
true
in
rural
areas
where
women
operators
running
extensive
rural
enjoyed
considerable
social
power
the
operator
knew
everyone
on
the
and
everyone
knew
her
although
bell
himself
was
an
ardent
suffragist
the
telephone
company
did
not
employ
women
for
the
sake
of
advancing
female
liberation
at
t
did
this
for
sound
commercial
reasons
the
first
telephone
operators
of
the
bell
system
were
not
women
but
teenage
american
boys
they
were
telegraphic
messenger
boys
a
group
about
to
be
rendered
technically
obsolescent
who
swept
up
around
the
phone
office
dunned
customers
for
bills
and
made
phone
connections
on
the
switchboard
all
on
the
cheap
within
the
very
first
year
of
operation
bell
company
learned
a
sharp
lesson
about
combining
teenage
boys
and
telephone
switchboards
putting
teenage
boys
in
charge
of
the
phone
system
brought
swift
and
consistent
disaster
bell
chief
engineer
described
them
as
wild
indians
the
boys
were
openly
rude
to
customers
they
talked
back
to
subscribers
saucing
off
uttering
facetious
remarks
and
generally
giving
lip
the
rascals
took
saint
patrick
day
off
without
permission
and
worst
of
all
they
played
clever
tricks
with
the
switchboard
plugs
disconnecting
calls
crossing
lines
so
that
customers
found
themselves
talking
to
strangers
and
so
forth
this
combination
of
power
technical
mastery
and
effective
anonymity
seemed
to
act
like
catnip
on
teenage
boys
this
phenomenon
was
not
confined
to
the
usa
from
the
beginning
the
same
was
true
of
the
british
phone
system
an
early
british
commentator
kindly
remarked
no
doubt
boys
in
their
teens
found
the
work
not
a
little
irksome
and
it
is
also
highly
probable
that
under
the
early
conditions
of
employment
the
adventurous
and
inquisitive
spirits
of
which
the
average
healthy
boy
of
that
age
is
possessed
were
not
always
conducive
to
the
best
attention
being
given
to
the
wants
of
the
telephone
subscribers
so
the
boys
were
flung
off
the
system
or
at
least
deprived
of
control
of
the
switchboard
but
the
adventurous
and
inquisitive
spirits
of
the
teenage
boys
would
be
heard
from
in
the
world
of
telephony
again
and
again
the
fourth
stage
in
the
technological
is
death
the
dog
dead
tech
the
telephone
has
so
far
avoided
this
fate
on
the
contrary
it
is
thriving
still
spreading
still
evolving
and
at
increasing
speed
the
telephone
has
achieved
a
rare
and
exalted
state
for
a
technological
artifact
it
has
become
a
household
object
the
telephone
like
the
clock
like
pen
and
paper
like
kitchen
utensils
and
running
water
has
become
a
technology
that
is
visible
only
by
its
absence
the
telephone
is
technologically
transparent
the
global
telephone
system
is
the
largest
and
most
complex
machine
in
the
world
yet
it
is
easy
to
use
more
remarkable
yet
the
telephone
is
almost
entirely
physically
safe
for
the
user
for
the
average
citizen
in
the
the
telephone
was
weirder
more
shocking
more
and
harder
to
comprehend
than
the
most
outrageous
stunts
of
advanced
computing
for
us
americans
in
the
in
trying
to
understand
what
is
happening
to
us
today
with
our
systems
direct
overseas
dialling
transmissions
computer
viruses
hacking
stunts
and
a
vivid
tangle
of
new
laws
and
new
crimes
it
is
important
to
realize
that
our
society
has
been
through
a
similar
challenge
before
and
that
all
in
all
we
did
rather
well
by
it
bell
stage
telephone
seemed
bizarre
at
first
but
the
sensations
of
weirdness
vanished
quickly
once
people
began
to
hear
the
familiar
voices
of
relatives
and
friends
in
their
own
homes
on
their
own
telephones
the
telephone
changed
from
a
fearsome
totem
to
an
everyday
pillar
of
human
community
this
has
also
happened
and
is
still
happening
to
computer
networks
computer
networks
such
as
nsfnet
bitnet
usenet
janet
are
technically
advanced
intimidating
and
much
harder
to
use
than
telephones
even
the
popular
commercial
computer
networks
such
as
genie
prodigy
and
compuserve
cause
much
and
have
been
described
as
nevertheless
they
too
are
changing
from
fancy
items
into
everyday
sources
of
human
community
the
words
community
and
communication
have
the
same
root
wherever
you
put
a
communications
network
you
put
a
community
as
well
and
whenever
you
take
away
that
network
confiscate
it
outlaw
it
crash
it
raise
its
price
beyond
affordability
then
you
hurt
that
community
communities
will
fight
to
defend
themselves
people
will
fight
harder
and
more
bitterly
to
defend
their
communities
than
they
will
fight
to
defend
their
own
individual
selves
and
this
is
very
true
of
the
electronic
community
that
arose
around
computer
networks
in
the
or
rather
the
various
electronic
communities
in
telephony
law
enforcement
computing
and
the
digital
underground
that
by
the
year
were
raiding
rallying
arresting
suing
jailing
fining
and
issuing
angry
manifestos
none
of
the
events
of
were
entirely
new
nothing
happened
in
that
did
not
have
some
kind
of
earlier
and
more
understandable
precedent
what
gave
the
hacker
crackdown
its
new
sense
of
gravity
and
importance
was
the
feeling
the
community
feeling
that
the
political
stakes
had
been
raised
that
trouble
in
cyberspace
was
no
longer
mere
mischief
or
inconclusive
skirmishing
but
a
genuine
fight
over
genuine
issues
a
fight
for
community
survival
and
the
shape
of
the
future
these
electronic
communities
having
flourished
throughout
the
were
becoming
aware
of
themselves
and
increasingly
becoming
aware
of
other
rival
communities
worries
were
sprouting
up
right
and
left
with
complaints
rumors
uneasy
speculations
but
it
would
take
a
catalyst
a
shock
to
make
the
new
world
evident
like
bell
great
publicity
break
the
tarriffville
rail
disaster
of
january
it
would
take
a
cause
celebre
that
cause
was
the
at
t
crash
of
january
after
the
crash
the
wounded
and
anxious
telephone
community
would
come
out
fighting
hard
the
community
of
telephone
technicians
engineers
operators
and
researchers
is
the
oldest
community
in
cyberspace
these
are
the
veterans
the
most
developed
group
the
richest
the
most
respectable
in
most
ways
the
most
powerful
whole
generations
have
come
and
gone
since
alexander

but
the
community
he
founded
survives
people
work
for
the

today
whose
worked
for
the

its
specialty
magazines
such
as

at

technical
journal
telephone
engineer
and
management
are
decades
old
they
make
computer
publications
like
macworld
and
pc
week
look
like
amateur
and
the
phone
companies
take
no
back
seat
in
either
other
companies
industrial
researchers
may
have
won
new
markets
but
the
researchers
of
bell
labs
have
won
seven
nobel
prizes
one
potent
device
that
bell
labs
originated
the
transistor
has
created
entire
groups
of
industries
bell
labs
are
for
generating
a
patent
a
day
and
have
even
made
vital
discoveries
in
astronomy
physics
and
cosmology
throughout
its
history
ma
bell
was
not
so
much
a
company
as
a
way
of
life
until
the
cataclysmic
divestiture
of
the
ma
bell
was
perhaps
the
ultimate
maternalist
the
at
t
corporate
image
was
the
gentle
giant
the
voice
with
a
smile
a
vaguely
world
of
cleanshaven
linemen
in
shiny
helmets
and
blandly
pretty
in
headsets
and
nylons
bell
system
employees
were
famous
as
kiwanis
and
rotary
members
enthusiasts
people
during
the
long
heyday
of
ma
bell
the
bell
employee
corps
were
nurtured
on
a
corporate
ethos
of
public
service
there
was
good
money
in
bell
but
bell
was
not
about
money
bell
used
public
relations
but
never
mere
marketeering
people
went
into
the
bell
system
for
a
good
life
and
they
had
a
good
life
but
it
was
not
mere
money
that
led
bell
people
out
in
the
midst
of
storms
and
earthquakes
to
fight
with
toppled
to
wade
in
flooded
manholes
to
pull
the
over
collapsing
the
bell
ethic
was
the
electrical
equivalent
of
the
postman
neither
rain
nor
snow
nor
gloom
of
night
would
stop
these
couriers
it
is
easy
to
be
cynical
about
this
as
it
is
easy
to
be
cynical
about
any
political
or
social
system
but
cynicism
does
not
change
the
fact
that
thousands
of
people
took
these
ideals
very
seriously
and
some
still
do
the
bell
ethos
was
about
public
service
and
that
was
gratifying
but
it
was
also
about
private
power
and
that
was
gratifying
too
as
a
corporation
bell
was
very
special
bell
was
privileged
bell
had
snuggled
up
close
to
the
state
in
fact
bell
was
as
close
to
government
as
you
could
get
in
america
and
still
make
a
whole
lot
of
legitimate
money
but
unlike
other
companies
bell
was
above
and
beyond
the
vulgar
commercial
fray
through
its
regional
operating
companies
bell
was
omnipresent
local
and
intimate
all
over
america
but
the
central
ivory
towers
at
its
corporate
heart
were
the
tallest
and
the
ivoriest
around
there
were
other
phone
companies
in
america
to
be
sure
the
independents
rural
cooperatives
mostly
small
fry
mostly
tolerated
sometimes
warred
upon
for
many
decades
independent
american
phone
companies
lived
in
fear
and
loathing
of
the
official
bell
monopoly
or
the
bell
octopus
as
ma
bell
enemies
described
her
in
many
angry
newspaper
manifestos
some
few
of
these
independent
entrepreneurs
while
legally
in
the
wrong
fought
so
bitterly
against
the
octopus
that
their
illegal
phone
networks
were
cast
into
the
street
by
bell
agents
and
publicly
burned
the
pure
technical
sweetness
of
the
bell
system
gave
its
operators
inventors
and
engineers
a
deeply
satisfying
sense
of
power
and
mastery
they
had
devoted
their
lives
to
improving
this
vast
machine
over
years
whole
human
lives
they
had
watched
it
improve
and
grow
it
was
like
a
great
technological
temple
they
were
an
elite
and
they
knew
it
even
if
others
did
not
in
fact
they
felt
even
more
powerful
because
others
did
not
understand
the
deep
attraction
of
this
sensation
of
elite
technical
power
should
never
be
underestimated
technical
power
is
not
for
everybody
for
many
people
it
simply
has
no
charm
at
all
but
for
some
people
it
becomes
the
core
of
their
lives
for
a
few
it
is
overwhelming
obsessive
it
becomes
something
close
to
an
addiction
people
especially
clever
teenage
boys
whose
lives
are
otherwise
mostly
powerless
and
love
this
sensation
of
secret
power
and
are
willing
to
do
all
sorts
of
amazing
things
to
achieve
it
the
technical
power
of
electronics
has
motivated
many
strange
acts
detailed
in
this
book
which
would
otherwise
be
inexplicable
so
bell
had
power
beyond
mere
capitalism
the
bell
service
ethos
worked
and
was
often
propagandized
in
a
rather
saccharine
fashion
over
the
decades
people
slowly
grew
tired
of
this
and
then
openly
impatient
with
it
by
the
early
ma
bell
was
to
find
herself
with
scarcely
a
real
friend
in
the
world
vail
industrial
socialism
had
become
hopelessly
politically
bell
would
be
punished
for
that
and
that
punishment
would
fall
harshly
upon
the
people
of
the
telephone
community
in
ma
bell
was
dismantled
by
federal
court
action
the
pieces
of
bell
are
now
separate
corporate
entities
the
core
of
the
company
became
at
t
communications
and
also
at
t
industries
formerly
western
electric
bell
manufacturing
arm
at
t
bell
labs
became
bell
communications
research
bellcore
then
there
are
the
regional
bell
operating
companies
or
rbocs
pronounced
arbocks
bell
was
a
titan
and
even
these
regional
chunks
are
gigantic
enterprises
fortune
companies
with
plenty
of
wealth
and
power
behind
them
but
the
clean
lines
of
one
policy
one
system
universal
service
have
been
shattered
apparently
forever
the
one
policy
of
the
early
reagan
administration
was
to
shatter
a
system
that
smacked
of
noncompetitive
socialism
since
that
time
there
has
been
no
real
telephone
policy
on
the
federal
level
despite
the
breakup
the
remnants
of
bell
have
never
been
set
free
to
compete
in
the
open
marketplace
the
rbocs
are
still
very
heavily
regulated
but
not
from
the
top
instead
they
struggle
politically
economically
and
legally
in
what
seems
an
endless
turmoil
in
a
patchwork
of
overlapping
federal
and
state
jurisdictions
increasingly
like
other
major
american
corporations
the
rbocs
are
becoming
multinational
acquiring
important
commercial
interests
in
europe
latin
america
and
the
pacific
rim
but
this
too
adds
to
their
legal
and
political
predicament
the
people
of
what
used
to
be
ma
bell
are
not
happy
about
their
fate
they
feel
they
might
have
been
grudgingly
willing
to
make
a
full
transition
to
the
free
market
to
become
just
companies
amid
other
companies
but
this
never
happened
instead
at
t
and
the
rbocs
the
baby
bells
feel
themselves
wrenched
from
side
to
side
by
state
regulators
by
congress
by
the
fcc
and
especially
by
the
federal
court
of
judge
harold
greene
the
magistrate
who
ordered
the
bell
breakup
and
who
has
been
the
de
facto
czar
of
american
telecommunications
ever
since
bell
people
feel
that
they
exist
in
a
kind
of
paralegal
limbo
today
they
do
understand
what
demanded
of
them
if
it
service
why
are
they
treated
like
a
public
service
and
if
it
money
then
why
are
they
free
to
compete
for
it
no
one
seems
to
know
really
those
who
claim
to
know
keep
changing
their
minds
nobody
in
authority
seems
willing
to
grasp
the
nettle
for
once
and
all
telephone
people
from
other
countries
are
amazed
by
the
american
telephone
system
today
not
that
it
works
so
well
for
nowadays
even
the
french
telephone
system
works
more
or
less
they
are
amazed
that
the
american
telephone
system
still
works
at
all
under
these
strange
conditions
bell
one
system
of
service
is
now
only
about
eighty
percent
of
a
system
with
the
remainder
held
by
sprint
mci
and
the
midget
companies
ugly
wars
over
dubious
corporate
practices
such
as
slamming
an
underhanded
method
of
snitching
clients
from
rivals
break
out
with
some
regularity
in
the
realm
of
service
the
battle
to
break
monopoly
was
long
and
ugly
and
since
the
breakup
the
battlefield
has
not
become
much
prettier
at
t
famous
advertisements
which
emphasized
the
shoddy
work
and
purported
ethical
shadiness
of
their
competitors
were
much
remarked
on
for
their
studied
psychological
cruelty
there
is
much
bad
blood
in
this
industry
and
much
resentment
at
t
corporate

a
striped

is
known
in
the

as
the
death

reference
from
the

the

and

every
technical
resource
available
including

has
been
devoted
to
assuring
it

not

the

told
they
were
further
assured
that
the
chances
of
a
recurrence
are
small
a
problem
of
this
magnitude
never
occurred
before
in
the
meantime
however
police
and
corporate
security
maintained
their
own
suspicions
about
the
chances
of
recurrence
and
the
real
reason
why
a
problem
of
this
magnitude
had
appeared
seemingly
out
of
nowhere
police
and
security
knew
for
a
fact
that
hackers
of
unprecedented
sophistication
were
illegally
entering
and
reprogramming
certain
digital
switching
stations
rumors
of
hidden
viruses
and
secret
logic
bombs
in
the
switches
ran
rampant
in
the
underground
with
much
chortling
over
at
t
predicament
and
idle
speculation
over
what
unsung
hacker
genius
was
responsible
for
it
some
hackers
including
police
informants
were
trying
hard
to
finger
one
another
as
the
true
culprits
of
the
crash
telco
people
found
little
comfort
in
objectivity
when
they
contemplated
these
possibilities
it
was
just
too
close
to
the
bone
for
them
it
was
embarrassing
it
hurt
so
much
it
was
hard
even
to
talk
about
there
has
always
been
thieving
and
misbehavior
in
the
phone
system
there
has
always
been
trouble
with
the
rival
independents
and
in
the
local
loops
but
to
have
such
trouble
in
the
core
of
the
system
the
switching
stations
is
a
horrifying
affair
to
telco
people
this
is
all
the
difference
between
finding
roaches
in
your
kitchen
and
big
horrid
in
your
bedroom
from
the
outside
to
the
average
citizen
the
telcos
still
seem
gigantic
and
impersonal
the
american
public
seems
to
regard
them
as
something
akin
to
soviet
apparats
even
when
the
telcos
do
their
best
routine
subsidizing
magnet
and
sponsoring
on
public
television
they
seem
to
win
little
except
public
suspicion
but
from
the
inside
all
this
looks
very
different
there
harsh
competition
a
legal
and
political
system
that
seems
baffled
and
bored
when
not
actively
hostile
to
telco
interests
there
a
loss
of
morale
a
deep
sensation
of
having
somehow
lost
the
upper
hand
technological
change
has
caused
a
loss
of
data
and
revenue
to
other
newer
forms
of
transmission
there
theft
and
new
forms
of
theft
of
growing
scale
and
boldness
and
sophistication
with
all
these
factors
it
was
no
surprise
to
see
the
telcos
large
and
small
break
out
in
a
litany
of
bitter
complaint
in
late
and
throughout
telco
representatives
grew
shrill
in
their
complaints
to
those
few
american
law
enforcement
officials
who
make
it
their
business
to
try
to
understand
what
telephone
people
are
talking
about
telco
security
officials
had
discovered
the
hacker
underground
infiltrated
it
thoroughly
and
become
deeply
alarmed
at
its
growing
expertise
here
they
had
found
a
target
that
was
not
only
loathsome
on
its
face
but
clearly
ripe
for
counterattack
those
bitter
rivals
at
t
mci
and
sprint
and
a
crowd
of
baby
bells
pacbell
bell
south
southwestern

nynex
uswest
as
well
as
the
bell
research
consortium
bellcore
and
the
independent

all
were
to
have
their
role
in
the
great
hacker
dragnet
of
after
years
of
being
battered
and
pushed
around
the
telcos
had
at
least
in
a
small
way
seized
the
initiative
again
after
years
of
turmoil
telcos
and
government
officials
were
once
again
to
work
smoothly
in
concert
in
defense
of
the
system
optimism
blossomed
enthusiasm
grew
on
all
sides
the
prospective
taste
of
vengeance
was
sweet
from
the
beginning
even
before
the
crackdown
had
a
name
secrecy
was
a
big
problem
there
were
many
good
reasons
for
secrecy
in
the
hacker
crackdown
hackers
and
were
wily
prey
slinking
back
to
their
bedrooms
and
basements
and
destroying
vital
incriminating
evidence
at
the
first
hint
of
trouble
furthermore
the
crimes
themselves
were
heavily
technical
and
difficult
to
describe
even
to
police
much
less
to
the
general
public
when
such
crimes
had
been
described
intelligibly
to
the
public
in
the
past
that
very
publicity
had
tended
to
increase
the
crimes
enormously
telco
officials
while
painfully
aware
of
the
vulnerabilities
of
their
systems
were
anxious
not
to
publicize
those
weaknesses
experience
showed
them
that
those
weaknesses
once
discovered
would
be
pitilessly
exploited
by
tens
of
thousands
of
people
not
only
by
professional
grifters
and
by
underground
hackers
and
phone
phreaks
but
by
many
otherwise
honest
everyday
folks
who
regarded
stealing
service
from
the
faceless
soulless
phone
company
as
a
kind
of
harmless
indoor
sport
when
it
came
to
protecting
their
interests
telcos
had
long
since
given
up
on
general
public
sympathy
for
the
voice
with
a
smile
nowadays
the
telco
voice
was
very
likely
to
be
a
computer
and
the
american
public
showed
much
less
of
the
proper
respect
and
gratitude
due
the
fine
public
service
bequeathed
them
by
bell
and
vail
the
more
efficient
computerized
and
impersonal
the
telcos
became
it
seemed
the
more
they
were
met
by
sullen
public
resentment
and
amoral
greed
telco
officials
wanted
to
punish
the
underground
in
as
public
and
exemplary
a
manner
as
possible
they
wanted
to
make
dire
examples
of
the
worst
offenders
to
seize
the
ringleaders
and
intimidate
the
small
fry
to
discourage
and
frighten
the
wacky
hobbyists
and
send
the
professional
grifters
to
jail
to
do
all
this
publicity
was
vital
yet
operational
secrecy
was
even
more
so
if
word
got
out
that
a
nationwide
crackdown
was
coming
the
hackers
might
simply
vanish
destroy
the
evidence
hide
their
computers
go
to
earth
and
wait
for
the
campaign
to
blow
over
even
the
young
hackers
were
crafty
and
suspicious
and
as
for
the
professional
grifters
they
tended
to
split
for
the
nearest
at
the
first
sign
of
trouble
for
the
crackdown
to
work
well
they
would
all
have
to
be
caught
swept
upon
suddenly
out
of
the
blue
from
every
corner
of
the
compass
and
there
was
another
strong
motive
for
secrecy
in
the
scenario
a
blown
campaign
might
leave
the
telcos
open
to
a
devastating
hacker
if
there
were
indeed
hackers
loose
in
america
who
had
caused
the
january
crash
if
there
were
truly
gifted
hackers
loose
in
the
nation
switching
systems
and
enraged
or
frightened
by
the
crackdown
then
they
might
react
unpredictably
to
an
attempt
to
collar
them
even
if
caught
they
might
have
talented
and
vengeful
friends
still
running
around
loose
conceivably
it
could
turn
ugly
very
ugly
in
fact
it
was
hard
to
imagine
just
how
ugly
things
might
turn
given
that
possibility
from
hackers
was
a
genuine
concern
for
the
telcos
in
point
of
fact
they
would
never
suffer
any
such
but
in
months
to
come
they
would
be
at
some
pains
to
publicize
this
notion
and
to
utter
grim
warnings
about
it
still
that
risk
seemed
well
worth
running
better
to
run
the
risk
of
vengeful
attacks
than
to
live
at
the
mercy
of
potential
crashers
any
cop
would
tell
you
that
a
protection
racket
had
no
real
future
and
publicity
was
such
a
useful
thing
corporate
security
officers
including
telco
security
generally
work
under
conditions
of
great
discretion
and
corporate
security
officials
do
not
make
money
for
their
companies
their
job
is
to
prevent
the
loss
of
money
which
is
much
less
glamorous
than
actually
winning
profits
if
you
are
a
corporate
security
official
and
you
do
your
job
brilliantly
then
nothing
bad
happens
to
your
company
at
all
because
of
this
you
appear
completely
superfluous
this
is
one
of
the
many
unattractive
aspects
of
security
work
it
rare
that
these
folks
have
the
chance
to
draw
some
healthy
attention
to
their
own
efforts
publicity
also
served
the
interest
of
their
friends
in
law
enforcement
public
officials
including
law
enforcement
officials
thrive
by
attracting
favorable
public
interest
a
brilliant
prosecution
in
a
matter
of
vital
public
interest
can
make
the
career
of
a
prosecuting
attorney
and
for
a
police
officer
good
publicity
opens
the
purses
of
the
legislature
it
may
bring
a
citation
or
a
promotion
or
at
least
a
rise
in
status
and
the
respect
of
one
peers
but
to
have
both
publicity
and
secrecy
is
to
have
one
cake
and
eat
it
too
in
months
to
come
as
we
will
show
this
impossible
act
was
to
cause
great
pain
to
the
agents
of
the
crackdown
but
early
on
it
seemed
possible
maybe
even
likely
that
the
crackdown
could
successfully
combine
the
best
of
both
worlds
the
arrest
of
hackers
would
be
heavily
publicized
the
actual
deeds
of
the
hackers
which
were
technically
hard
to
explain
and
also
a
security
risk
would
be
left
decently
obscured
the
threat
hackers
posed
would
be
heavily
trumpeted
the
likelihood
of
their
actually
committing
such
fearsome
crimes
would
be
left
to
the
public
imagination
the
spread
of
the
computer
underground
and
its
growing
technical
sophistication
would
be
heavily
promoted
the
actual
hackers
themselves
mostly
bespectacled
white
suburban
teenagers
would
be
denied
any
personal
publicity
it
does
not
seem
to
have
occurred
to
any
telco
official
that
the
hackers
accused
would
demand
a
day
in
court
that
journalists
would
smile
upon
the
hackers
as
good
copy
that
wealthy
entrepreneurs
would
offer
moral
and
financial
support
to
crackdown
victims
that
constitutional
lawyers
would
show
up
with
briefcases
frowning
mightily
this
possibility
does
not
seem
to
have
ever
entered
the
and
even
if
it
had
it
probably
would
not
have
slowed
the
ferocious
pursuit
of
a
stolen
document
mellifluously
known
as
control
office
administration
of
enhanced
services
for
special
services
and
major
account
centers
in
the
chapters
to
follow
we
will
explore
the
worlds
of
police
and
the
computer
underground
and
the
large
shadowy
area
where
they
overlap
but
first
we
must
explore
the
battleground
before
we
leave
the
world
of
the
telcos
we
must
understand
what
a
switching
system
actually
is
and
how
your
telephone
actually
works
to
the
average
citizen
the
idea
of
the
telephone
is
represented
by
well
a
telephone
a
device
that
you
talk
into
to
a
telco
professional
however
the
telephone
itself
is
known
in
lordly
fashion
as
a
subset
the
subset
in
your
house
is
a
mere
adjunct
a
distant
nerve
ending
of
the
central
switching
stations
which
are
ranked
in
levels
of
heirarchy
up
to
the
electronic
switching
stations
which
are
some
of
the
largest
computers
on
earth
let
us
imagine
that
it
is
say
before
the
introduction
of
computers
when
the
phone
system
was
simpler
and
somewhat
easier
to
grasp
let
further
imagine
that
you
are
miss
leticia
luthor
a
fictional
operator
for
ma
bell
in
new
york
city
of
the
basically
you
miss
luthor
are
the
switching
system
you
are
sitting
in
front
of
a
large
vertical
switchboard
known
as
a
cordboard
made
of
shiny
wooden
panels
with
ten
thousand
holes
punched
in
them
known
as
jacks
the
engineers
would
have
put
more
holes
into
your
switchboard
but
ten
thousand
is
as
many
as
you
can
reach
without
actually
having
to
get
up
out
of
your
chair
each
of
these
ten
thousand
holes
has
its
own
little
electric
lightbulb
known
as
a
lamp
and
its
own
neatly
printed
number
code
with
the
ease
of
long
habit
you
are
scanning
your
board
for
bulbs
this
is
what
you
do
most
of
the
time
so
you
are
used
to
it
a
lamp
lights
up
this
means
that
the
phone
at
the
end
of
that
line
has
been
taken
off
the
hook
whenever
a
handset
is
taken
off
the
hook
that
closes
a
circuit
inside
the
phone
which
then
signals
the
local
office
you
automatically
there
might
be
somebody
calling
or
then
again
the
phone
might
be
simply
off
the
hook
but
this
does
not
matter
to
you
yet
the
first
thing
you
do
is
record
that
number
in
your
logbook
in
your
fine
american
handwriting
this
comes
first
naturally
since
it
is
done
for
billing
purposes
you
now
take
the
plug
of
your
answering
cord
which
goes
directly
to
your
headset
and
plug
it
into
the
hole
operator
you
announce
in
operator
classes
before
taking
this
job
you
have
been
issued
a
large
pamphlet
full
of
canned
responses
for
all
kinds
of
contingencies
which
you
had
to
memorize
you
have
also
been
trained
in
a
proper
pronunciation
and
tone
of
voice
you
rarely
have
the
occasion
to
make
any
spontaneous
remark
to
a
customer
and
in
fact
this
is
frowned
upon
except
out
on
the
rural
lines
where
people
have
time
on
their
hands
and
get
up
to
all
kinds
of
mischief
a
user
voice
at
the
end
of
the
line
gives
you
a
number
immediately
you
write
that
number
down
in
your
logbook
next
to
the
caller
number
which
you
just
wrote
earlier
you
then
look
and
see
if
the
number
this
guy
wants
is
in
fact
on
your
switchboard
which
it
generally
is
since
it
generally
a
local
call
long
distance
costs
so
much
that
people
use
it
sparingly
only
then
do
you
pick
up
a
from
a
shelf
at
the
base
of
the
switchboard
this
is
a
long
elastic
cord
mounted
on
a
kind
of
reel
so
that
it
will
zip
back
in
when
you
unplug
it
there
are
a
lot
of
cords
down
there
and
when
a
bunch
of
them
are
out
at
once
they
look
like
a
nest
of
snakes
some
of
the
girls
think
there
are
bugs
living
in
those
they
called
cable
mites
and
are
supposed
to
bite
your
hands
and
give
you
rashes
you
do
believe
this
yourself
gripping
the
head
of
your
you
slip
the
tip
of
it
deftly
into
the
sleeve
of
the
jack
for
the
called
person
not
all
the
way
in
though
you
just
touch
it
if
you
hear
a
clicking
sound
that
means
the
line
is
busy
and
you
put
the
call
through
if
the
line
is
busy
you
have
to
stick
the
into
a
jack
which
will
give
the
guy
a
this
way
you
do
have
to
talk
to
him
yourself
and
absorb
his
natural
human
frustration
but
the
line
is
busy
so
you
pop
the
cord
all
the
way
in
relay
circuits
in
your
board
make
the
distant
phone
ring
and
if
somebody
picks
it
up
off
the
hook
then
a
phone
conversation
starts
you
can
hear
this
conversation
on
your
answering
cord
until
you
unplug
it
in
fact
you
could
listen
to
the
whole
conversation
if
you
wanted
but
this
is
sternly
frowned
upon
by
management
and
frankly
when
you
overheard
one
you
pretty
much
heard
all
you
can
tell
how
long
the
conversation
lasts
by
the
glow
of
the
lamp
down
on
the
shelf
when
it
over
you
unplug
and
the
zips
back
into
place
having
done
this
stuff
a
few
hundred
thousand
times
you
become
quite
good
at
it
in
fact
you
plugging
and
connecting
and
disconnecting
ten
twenty
forty
cords
at
a
time
it
a
manual
handicraft
really
quite
satisfying
in
a
way
rather
like
weaving
on
an
upright
loom
should
a
call
come
up
it
would
be
different
but
not
all
that
different
instead
of
connecting
the
call
through
your
own
local
switchboard
you
have
to
go
up
the
hierarchy
onto
the
lines
known
as
trunklines
depending
on
how
far
the
call
goes
it
may
have
to
work
its
way
through
a
whole
series
of
operators
which
can
take
quite
a
while
the
caller
does
wait
on
the
line
while
this
complex
process
is
negotiated
across
the
country
by
the
gaggle
of
operators
instead
the
caller
hangs
up
and
you
call
him
back
yourself
when
the
call
has
finally
worked
its
way
through
after
four
or
five
years
of
this
work
you
get
married
and
you
have
to
quit
your
job
this
being
the
natural
order
of
womanhood
in
the
american
the
phone
company
has
to
train
somebody
else
maybe
two
people
since
the
phone
system
has
grown
somewhat
in
the
meantime
and
this
costs
money
in
fact
to
use
any
kind
of
human
being
as
a
switching
system
is
a
very
expensive
proposition
eight
thousand
leticia
luthors
would
be
bad
enough
but
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
them
is
a
proposition
and
makes
drastic
measures
in
automation
financially
worthwhile
although
the
phone
system
continues
to
grow
today
the
number
of
human
beings
employed
by
telcos
has
been
dropping
steadily
for
years
phone
operators
now
deal
with
nothing
but
unusual
contingencies
all
routine
operations
having
been
shrugged
off
onto
machines
consequently
telephone
operators
are
considerably
less
nowadays
and
have
been
known
to
have
accents
and
actual
character
in
their
voices
when
you
reach
a
human
operator
today
the
operators
are
rather
more
human
than
they
were
in
leticia
day
but
on
the
other
hand
human
beings
in
the
phone
system
are
much
harder
to
reach
in
the
first
place
over
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
electromechanical
switching
systems
of
growing
complexity
were
cautiously
introduced
into
the
phone
system
in
certain
backwaters
some
of
these
hybrid
systems
are
still
in
use
but
after
the
phone
system
began
to
go
completely
electronic
and
this
is
by
far
the
dominant
mode
today
electromechanical
systems
have
crossbars
and
brushes
and
other
large
moving
mechanical
parts
which
while
faster
and
cheaper
than
leticia
are
still
slow
and
tend
to
wear
out
fairly
quickly
but
fully
electronic
systems
are
inscribed
on
silicon
chips
and
are
very
cheap
and
quite
durable
they
are
much
cheaper
to
maintain
than
even
the
best
electromechanical
systems
and
they
fit
into
half
the
space
and
with
every
year
the
silicon
chip
grows
smaller
faster
and
cheaper
yet
best
of
all
automated
electronics
work
around
the
clock
and
do
have
salaries
or
health
insurance
there
are
however
quite
serious
drawbacks
to
the
use
of
when
they
do
break
down
it
is
a
daunting
challenge
to
figure
out
what
the
heck
has
gone
wrong
with
them
a
broken
cordboard
generally
had
a
problem
in
it
big
enough
to
see
a
broken
chip
has
invisible
microscopic
faults
and
the
faults
in
bad
software
can
be
so
subtle
as
to
be
practically
theological
if
you
want
a
mechanical
system
to
do
something
new
then
you
must
travel
to
where
it
is
and
pull
pieces
out
of
it
and
wire
in
new
pieces
this
costs
money
however
if
you
want
a
chip
to
do
something
new
all
you
have
to
do
is
change
its
software
which
is
easy
fast
and
you
do
even
have
to
see
the
chip
to
change
its
program
even
if
you
did
see
the
chip
it
would
look
like
much
a
chip
with
program
x
does
look
one
whit
different
from
a
chip
with
program
y
with
the
proper
codes
and
sequences
and
access
to
specialized
you
can
change
electronic
switching
systems
all
over
america
from
anywhere
you
please
and
so
can
other
people
if
they
know
how
and
if
they
want
to
they
can
sneak
into
a
microchip
via
the
special
phonelines
and
diddle
with
it
leaving
no
physical
trace
at
all
if
they
broke
into
the
operator
station
and
held
leticia
at
gunpoint
that
would
be
very
obvious
if
they
broke
into
a
telco
building
and
went
after
an
electromechanical
switch
with
a
toolbelt
that
would
at
least
leave
many
traces
but
people
can
do
all
manner
of
amazing
things
to
computer
switches
just
by
typing
on
a
keyboard
and
keyboards
are
everywhere
today
the
extent
of
this
vulnerability
is
deep
dark
broad
almost
and
yet
this
is
a
basic
primal
fact
of
life
about
any
computer
on
a
network
security
experts
over
the
past
twenty
years
have
insisted
with
growing
urgency
that
this
basic
vulnerability
of
computers
represents
an
entirely
new
level
of
risk
of
unknown
but
obviously
dire
potential
to
society
and
they
are
right
an
electronic
switching
station
does
pretty
much
everything
letitia
did
except
in
nanoseconds
and
on
a
much
larger
scale
compared
to
miss
ten
thousand
jacks
even
a
primitive
switching
computer
vintage
has
a
lines
and
the
current
at
t
system
of
choice
is
the
monstrous
an
electronic
switching
station
can
scan
every
line
on
its
board
in
a
tenth
of
a
second
and
it
does
this
over
and
over
tirelessly
around
the
clock
instead
of
eyes
it
uses
ferrod
scanners
to
check
the
condition
of
local
lines
and
trunks
instead
of
hands
it
has
signal
distributors
central
pulse
distributors
magnetic
latching
relays
and
reed
switches
which
complete
and
break
the
calls
instead
of
a
brain
it
has
a
central
processor
instead
of
an
instruction
manual
it
has
a
program
instead
of
a
handwritten
logbook
for
recording
and
billing
calls
it
has
magnetic
tapes
and
it
never
has
to
talk
to
anybody
everything
a
customer
might
say
to
it
is
done
by
punching
the
tone
buttons
on
your
subset
although
an
electronic
switching
station
ca
talk
it
does
need
an
interface
some
way
to
relate
to
its
er
employers
this
interface
is
known
as
the
master
control
center
this
interface
might
be
better
known
simply
as
the
interface
since
it
does
actually
control
phone
calls
directly
however
a
term
like
master
control
center
is
just
the
kind
of
rhetoric
that
telco
maintenance
engineers
and
hackers
find
particularly
satisfying
using
the
master
control
center
a
phone
engineer
can
test
local
and
trunk
lines
for
malfunctions
he
rarely
she
can
check
various
alarm
displays
measure
traffic
on
the
lines
examine
the
records
of
telephone
usage
and
the
charges
for
those
calls
and
change
the
programming
and
of
course
anybody
else
who
gets
into
the
master
control
center
by
remote
control
can
also
do
these
things
if
he
rarely
she
has
managed
to
figure
them
out
or
more
likely
has
somehow
swiped
the
knowledge
from
people
who
already
know
in
and
one
particular
rboc
bellsouth
which
felt
particularly
troubled
spent
a
purported
million
on
computer
security
some
think
it
spent
as
much
as
two
million
if
you
count
all
the
associated
costs
two
million
dollars
is
still
very
little
compared
to
the
great
utility
of
telephonic
computer
systems
unfortunately
computers
are
also
stupid
unlike
human
beings
computers
possess
the
truly
profound
stupidity
of
the
inanimate
in
the
in
the
first
shocks
of
spreading
computerization
there
was
much
easy
talk
about
the
stupidity
of
computers
how
they
could
only
follow
the
program
and
were
rigidly
required
to
do
only
what
they
were
told
there
has
been
rather
less
talk
about
the
stupidity
of
computers
since
they
began
to
achieve
grandmaster
status
in
chess
tournaments
and
to
manifest
many
other
impressive
forms
of
apparent
cleverness
nevertheless
computers
still
are
profoundly
brittle
and
stupid
they
are
simply
vastly
more
subtle
in
their
stupidity
and
brittleness
the
computers
of
the
are
much
more
reliable
in
their
components
than
earlier
computer
systems
but
they
are
also
called
upon
to
do
far
more
complex
things
under
far
more
challenging
conditions
on
a
basic
mathematical
level
every
single
line
of
a
software
program
offers
a
chance
for
some
possible
screwup
software
does
not
sit
still
when
it
works
it
runs
it
interacts
with
itself
and
with
its
own
inputs
and
outputs
by
analogy
it
stretches
like
putty
into
millions
of
possible
shapes
and
conditions
so
many
shapes
that
they
can
never
all
be
successfully
tested
not
even
in
the
lifespan
of
the
universe
sometimes
the
putty
snaps
the
stuff
we
call
software
is
not
like
anything
that
human
society
is
used
to
thinking
about
software
is
something
like
a
machine
and
something
like
mathematics
and
something
like
language
and
something
like
thought
and
art
and
information
but
software
is
not
in
fact
any
of
those
other
things
the
protean
quality
of
software
is
one
of
the
great
sources
of
its
fascination
it
also
makes
software
very
powerful
very
subtle
very
unpredictable
and
very
risky
some
software
is
bad
and
buggy
some
is
robust
even
bulletproof
the
best
software
is
that
which
has
been
tested
by
thousands
of
users
under
thousands
of
different
conditions
over
years
it
is
then
known
as
stable
this
does
not
mean
that
the
software
is
now
flawless
free
of
bugs
it
generally
means
that
there
are
plenty
of
bugs
in
it
but
the
bugs
are
and
fairly
well
understood
there
is
simply
no
way
to
assure
that
software
is
free
of
flaws
though
software
is
mathematical
in
nature
it
can
not
by
proven
like
a
mathematical
theorem
software
is
more
like
language
with
inherent
ambiguities
with
different
definitions
different
assumptions
different
levels
of
meaning
that
can

human
beings
can
manage
more
or
less
with
human
language
because
we
can
catch
the
gist
of
it
computers
despite
years
of
effort
in
artificial
intelligence
have
proven
spectacularly
bad
in
catching
the
gist
of
anything
at
all
the
tiniest
bit
of
semantic
grit
may
still
bring
the
mightiest
computer
tumbling
down
one
of
the
most
hazardous
things
you
can
do
to
a
computer
program
is
try
to
improve
it
to
try
to
make
it
safer
software
patches
represent
new
untried
stable
software
which
is
by
definition
riskier
the
modern
telephone
system
has
come
to
depend
utterly
and
irretrievably
upon
software
and
the
system
crash
of
january
was
caused
by
an
improvement
in
software
or
rather
an
attempted
improvement
as
it
happened
the
problem
itself
the
problem
per
se
took
this
form
a
piece
of
telco
software
had
been
written
in
c
language
a
standard
language
of
the
telco
field
within
the
c
software
was
a
long
do
construct
the
do
construct
contained
a
switch
statement
the
switch
statement
contained
an
if
clause
the
if
clause
contained
a
break
the
break
was
supposed
to
break
the
if
clause
instead
the
break
broke
the
switch
statement
that
was
the
problem
the
actual
reason
why
people
picking
up
phones
on
january
could
not
talk
to
one
another
or
at
least
that
was
the
subtle
abstract
cyberspatial
seed
of
the
problem
this
is
how
the
problem
manifested
itself
from
the
realm
of
programming
into
the
realm
of
real
life
the
system
software
for
at
t
switching
station
the
generic
central
office
switch
software
had
been
extensively
tested
and
was
considered
very
stable
by
the
end
of
eighty
of
at
t
switching
systems
nationwide
had
been
programmed
with
the
new
software
cautiously
stations
were
left
to
run
the
slower
system
because
at
t
suspected
there
might
be
shakedown
problems
with
the
new
and
unprecedently
sophisticated
system
network
the
stations
with
system
were
programmed
to
switch
over
to
a
backup
net
in
case
of
any
problems
in
however
a
new
software
patch
was
distributed
to
each
of
the
switches
that
would
enable
them
to
switch
over
even
more
quickly
making
the
system
network
that
much
more
secure
unfortunately
every
one
of
these
switches
was
now
in
possession
of
a
small
but
deadly
flaw
in
order
to
maintain
the
network
switches
must
monitor
the
condition
of
other
switches
whether
they
are
up
and
running
whether
they
have
temporarily
shut
down
whether
they
are
overloaded
and
in
need
of
assistance
and
so
forth
the
new
software
helped
control
this
bookkeeping
function
by
monitoring
the
status
calls
from
other
switches
it
only
takes
four
to
six
seconds
for
a
troubled
switch
to
rid
itself
of
all
its
calls
drop
everything
temporarily
and
its
software
from
scratch
starting
over
from
scratch
will
generally
rid
the
switch
of
any
software
problems
that
may
have
developed
in
the
course
of
running
the
system
bugs
that
arise
will
be
simply
wiped
out
by
this
process
it
is
a
clever
idea
this
process
of
automatically
from
scratch
is
known
as
the
normal
fault
recovery
routine
since
at
t
software
is
in
fact
exceptionally
stable
systems
rarely
have
to
go
into
fault
recovery
in
the
first
place
but
at
t
has
always
boasted
of
its
real
world
reliability
and
this
tactic
is
a
routine
the
switch
used
its
new
software
to
monitor
its
fellow
switches
as
they
recovered
from
faults
as
other
switches
came
back
on
line
after
recovery
they
would
send
their
ok
signals
to
the
switch
the
switch
would
make
a
little
note
to
that
effect
in
its
status
map
recognizing
that
the
fellow
switch
was
back
and
ready
to
go
and
should
be
sent
some
calls
and
put
back
to
regular
work
unfortunately
while
it
was
busy
bookkeeping
with
the
status
map
the
tiny
flaw
in
the
software
came
into
play
the
flaw
caused
the
switch
to
interact
subtly
but
drastically
with
incoming
telephone
calls
from
human
users
if
and
only
if
two
incoming
happened
to
hit
the
switch
within
a
hundredth
of
a
second
then
a
small
patch
of
data
would
be
garbled
by
the
flaw
but
the
switch
had
been
programmed
to
monitor
itself
constantly
for
any
possible
damage
to
its
data
when
the
switch
perceived
that
its
data
had
been
somehow
garbled
then
it
too
would
go
down
for
swift
repairs
to
its
software
it
would
signal
its
fellow
switches
not
to
send
any
more
work
it
would
go
into
the
mode
for
four
to
six
seconds
and
then
the
switch
would
be
fine
again
and
would
send
out
its
ok
ready
for
work
signal
however
the
ok
ready
for
work
signal
was
the
very
thing
that
had
caused
the
switch
to
go
down
in
the
first
place
and
all
the
system
switches
had
the
same
flaw
in
their
software
as
soon
as
they
stopped
to
make
the
bookkeeping
note
that
their
fellow
switch
was
ok
then
they
too
would
become
vulnerable
to
the
slight
chance
that
two
would
hit
them
within
a
hundredth
of
a
second
at
approximately
est
on
monday
january
one
of
at
t
toll
switching
systems
in
new
york
city
had
an
actual
legitimate
minor
problem
it
went
into
fault
recovery
routines
announced
i
going
down
then
announced
i
back
i
and
this
cheery
message
then
blasted
throughout
the
network
to
many
of
its
fellow
switches
many
of
the
switches
at
first
completely
escaped
trouble
these
lucky
switches
were
not
hit
by
the
coincidence
of
two
phone
calls
within
a
hundredth
of
a
second
their
software
did
not
fail
at
first
but
three
switches
in
atlanta
louis
and
detroit
were
unlucky
and
were
caught
with
their
hands
full
and
they
went
down
and
they
came
back
up
almost
immediately
and
they
too
began
to
broadcast
the
lethal
message
that
they
too
were
ok
again
activating
the
lurking
software
bug
in
yet
other
switches
as
more
and
more
switches
did
have
that
bit
of
bad
luck
and
collapsed
the
became
more
and
more
densely
packed
in
the
remaining
switches
which
were
groaning
to
keep
up
with
the
load
and
of
course
as
the
calls
became
more
densely
packed
the
switches
were
much
more
likely
to
be
hit
twice
within
a
hundredth
of
a
second
it
only
took
four
seconds
for
a
switch
to
get
well
there
was
no
physical
damage
of
any
kind
to
the
switches
after
all
physically
they
were
working
perfectly
this
situation
was
only
a
software
problem
but
the
switches
were
leaping
up
and
down
every
four
to
six
seconds
in
a
virulent
spreading
wave
all
over
america
in
utter
manic
mechanical
stupidity
they
kept
knocking
one
another
down
with
their
contagious
ok
messages
it
took
about
ten
minutes
for
the
chain
reaction
to
cripple
the
network
even
then
switches
would
periodically
and
manage
to
resume
their
normal
work
many
calls
millions
of
them
were
managing
to
get
through
but
millions
were
the
switching
stations
that
used
system
were
not
directly
affected
thanks
to
these
switches
at
t
national
system
avoided
complete
collapse
this
fact
also
made
it
clear
to
engineers
that
system
was
at
fault
bell
labs
engineers
working
feverishly
in
new
jersey
illinois
and
ohio
first
tried
their
entire
repertoire
of
standard
network
remedies
on
the
malfunctioning
system
none
of
the
remedies
worked
of
course
because
nothing
like
this
had
ever
happened
to
any
phone
system
before
by
cutting
out
the
backup
safety
network
entirely
they
were
able
to
reduce
the
frenzy
of
ok
messages
by
about
half
the
system
then
began
to
recover
as
the
chain
reaction
slowed
by
on
monday
january
sweating
engineers
on
the
midnight
shift
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
the
last
switch
by
tuesday
they
were
pulling
all
the
software
and
replacing
it
with
an
earlier
version
of
system
if
these
had
been
human
operators
rather
than
computers
at
work
someone
would
simply
have
eventually
stopped
screaming
it
would
have
been
obvious
that
the
situation
was
not
ok
and
common
sense
would
have
kicked
in
humans
possess
common
sense
at
least
to
some
extent
computers
simply
do
on
the
other
hand
computers
can
handle
hundreds
of
calls
per
second
humans
simply
ca
if
every
single
human
being
in
america
worked
for
the
phone
company
we
could
match
the
performance
of
digital
switches
calling
waiting
caller
id
all
the
rest
of
the
cornucopia
of
digital
bounty
replacing
computers
with
operators
is
simply
not
an
option
any
more
and
yet
we
still
anachronistically
expect
humans
to
be
running
our
phone
system
it
is
hard
for
us
to
understand
that
we
have
sacrificed
huge
amounts
of
initiative
and
control
to
senseless
yet
powerful
machines
when
the
phones
fail
we
want
somebody
to
be
responsible
we
want
somebody
to
blame
when
the
crash
of
january
happened
the
american
populace
was
simply
not
prepared
to
understand
that
enormous
landslides
in
cyberspace
like
the
crash
itself
can
happen
and
can
be
nobody
fault
in
particular
it
was
easier
to
believe
maybe
even
in
some
odd
way
more
reassuring
to
believe
that
some
evil
person
or
evil
group
had
done
this
to
us
hackers
had
done
it
with
a
virus
a
trojan
horse
a
software
bomb
a
dirty
plot
of
some
kind
people
believed
this
responsible
people
in
they
were
looking
hard
for
evidence
to
confirm
their
heartfelt
suspicions
and
they
would
look
in
a
lot
of
places
come
however
the
outlines
of
an
apparent
new
reality
would
begin
to
emerge
from
the
fog
on
july
and
collapses
in
telephone
switching
stations
disrupted
service
in
washington
dc
pittsburgh
los

and
san
francisco
once
again
seemingly
minor
maintenance
problems
had
crippled
the
digital
system
about
twelve
million
people
were
affected
in
the
crash
of
july
said
the
new

times
service
telephone
company
executives
and
federal
regulators
said
they
were
not
ruling
out
the
possibility
of
sabotage
by
computer
hackers
but
most
seemed
to
think
the
problems
stemmed
from
some
unknown
defect
in
the
software
running
the
networks
and
sure
enough
within
the
week
a
software
company
dsc
communications
corporation
of
plano
texas
owned
up
to
glitches
in
the
signal
transfer
point
software
that
dsc
had
designed
for
bell
atlantic
and
pacific
bell
the
immediate
cause
of
the
july
crash
was
a
single
mistyped
character
one
tiny
typographical
flaw
in
one
single
line
of
the
software
one
mistyped
letter
in
one
single
line
had
deprived
the
nation
capital
of
phone
service
it
was
not
particularly
surprising
that
this
tiny
flaw
had
escaped
attention
a
typical
system
station
requires
ten
million
lines
of
code
on
tuesday
september
came
the
most
spectacular
outage
yet
this
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
software
failures
at
least
not
directly
instead
a
group
of
at
t
switching
stations
in
new
york
city
had
simply
run
out
of
electrical
power
and
shut
down
cold
their
batteries
had
failed
automatic
warning
systems
were
supposed
to
warn
of
the
loss
of

power
but
those
automatic
systems
had
failed
as
well
this
time
kennedy
la
guardia
and
newark
airports
all
had
their
voice
and
data
communications
cut
this
horrifying
event
was
particularly
ironic
as
attacks
on
airport
computers
by
hackers
had
long
been
a
standard
nightmare
scenario
much
trumpeted
by
experts
who
feared
the
computer
underground
there
had
even
been
a
hollywood

ii
now

crippled

with
computer

not
just
one
airport
but
three

once
some

throughout

all

of
all
the

in
the

the

the
civil

and
the

themselves
the
hackers
are
by
far
the
most
mysterious
by
far
the
hardest
to
understand
by
far
the
weirdest
not
only
are
hackers
novel
in
their
activities
but
they
come
in
a
variety
of
odd
subcultures
with
a
variety
of
languages
motives
and
values
the
earliest
were
probably
those
unsung
mischievous
telegraph
boys
who
were
summarily
fired
by
the
bell
company
in
legitimate
hackers
those
computer
enthusiasts
who
are
but
generally
trace
their
spiritual
ancestry
to
elite
technical
universities
especially
and
stanford
in
the
but
the
genuine
roots
of
the
modern
hacker
underground
can
probably
be
traced
most
successfully
to
a
now
hippie
anarchist
movement
known
as
the
yippies
the
yippies
who
took
their
name
from
the
largely
fictional
youth
international
party
carried
out
a
loud
and
lively
policy
of
surrealistic
subversion
and
outrageous
political
mischief
their
basic
tenets
were
flagrant
sexual
promiscuity
open
and
copious
drug
use
the
political
overthrow
of
any
powermonger
over
thirty
years
of
age
and
an
immediate
end
to
the
war
in
vietnam
by
any
means
necessary
including
the
psychic
levitation
of
the
pentagon
the
two
most
visible
yippies
were
abbie
hoffman
and
jerry
rubin
rubin
eventually
became
a
wall
street
broker
hoffman
ardently
sought
by
federal
authorities
went
into
hiding
for
seven
years
in
mexico
france
and
the
united
states
while
on
the
lam
hoffman
continued
to
write
and
publish
with
help
from
sympathizers
in
the
american
underground
mostly
hoffman
survived
through
false
id
and
odd
jobs
eventually
he
underwent
facial
plastic
surgery
and
adopted
an
entirely
new
identity
as
one
barry
freed
after
surrendering
himself
to
authorities
in
hoffman
spent
a
year
in
prison
on
a
cocaine
conviction
hoffman
worldview
grew
much
darker
as
the
glory
days
of
the
faded
in
he
purportedly
committed
suicide
under
odd
and
to
some
rather
suspicious
circumstances
abbie
hoffman
is
said
to
have
caused
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
amass
the
single
largest
investigation
file
ever
opened
on
an
individual
american
citizen
if
this
is
true
it
is
still
questionable
whether
the
fbi
regarded
abbie
hoffman
a
serious
public
threat
quite
possibly
his
file
was
enormous
simply
because
hoffman
left
colorful
legendry
wherever
he
went
he
was
a
gifted
publicist
who
regarded
electronic
media
as
both
playground
and
weapon
he
actively
enjoyed
manipulating
network
tv
and
other
gullible
media
with
various
weird
lies
mindboggling
rumors
impersonation
scams
and
other
sinister
distortions
all
absolutely
guaranteed
to
upset
cops
presidential
candidates
and
federal
judges
hoffman
most
famous
work
was
a
book
known
as
steal
this
book
which
publicized
a
number
of
methods
by
which
young
penniless
hippie
agitators
might
live
off
the
fat
of
a
system
supported
by
humorless
drones
steal
this
book
whose
title
urged
readers
to
damage
the
very
means
of
distribution
which
had
put
it
into
their
hands
might
be
described
as
a
spiritual
ancestor
of
a
computer
virus
hoffman
like
many
a
later
conspirator
made
extensive
use
of
for
his
agitation
work
in
his
case
generally
through
the
use
of
cheap
brass
washers
as
during
the
vietnam
war
there
was
a
federal
surtax
imposed
on
telephone
service
hoffman
and
his
cohorts
could
and
did
argue
that
in
systematically
stealing
phone
service
they
were
engaging
in
civil
disobedience
virtuously
denying
tax
funds
to
an
illegal
and
immoral
war
but
this
thin
veil
of
decency
was
soon
dropped
entirely
the
system
found
its
own
justification
in
deep
alienation
and
a
basic
outlaw
contempt
for
conventional
bourgeois
values
ingenious
vaguely
politicized
varieties
of
which
might
be
described
as
anarchy
by
convenience
became
very
popular
in
yippie
circles
and
because
was
so
useful
it
was
to
survive
the
yippie
movement
itself
in
the
early
it
required
fairly
limited
expertise
and
ingenuity
to
cheat
payphones
to
divert
free
electricity
and
gas
service
or
to
rob
vending
machines
and
parking
meters
for
handy
pocket
change
it
also
required
a
conspiracy
to
spread
this
knowledge
and
the
gall
and
nerve
actually
to
commit
petty
theft
but
the
yippies
had
these
qualifications
in
plenty
in
june
abbie
hoffman
and
a
telephone
enthusiast
sarcastically
known
as
al
bell
began
publishing
a
newsletter
called
youth
international
party
line
this
newsletter
was
dedicated
to
collating
and
spreading
yippie
techniques
especially
of
phones
to
the
joy
of
the
freewheeling
underground
and
the
insensate
rage
of
all
straight
people
as
a
political
tactic
theft
ensured
that
yippie
advocates
would
always
have
ready
access
to
the
telephone
as
a
medium
despite
the
yippies
chronic
lack
of
organization
discipline
money
or
even
a
steady
home
address
party
line
was
run
out
of
greenwich
village
for
a
couple
of
years
then
al
bell
more
or
less
defected
from
the
faltering
ranks
of
yippiedom
changing
the
newsletter
name
to
tap
or
technical
assistance
program
after
the
vietnam
war
ended
the
steam
began
leaking
rapidly
out
of
american
radical
dissent
but
by
this
time
bell
and
his
dozen
or
so
core
contributors
had
the
bit
between
their
teeth
and
had
begun
to
derive
tremendous
satisfaction
from
the
sensation
of
pure
technical
power
tap
articles
once
highly
politicized
became
pitilessly
jargonized
and
technical
in
homage
or
parody
to
the
bell
system
own
technical
documents
which
tap
studied
closely
gutted
and
reproduced
without
permission
the
tap
elite
revelled
in
gloating
possession
of
the
specialized
knowledge
necessary
to
beat
the
system
al
bell
dropped
out
of
the
game
by
the
late
and
tom
edison
took
over
tap
readers
some
of
them
all
told
now
began
to
show
more
interest
in
telex
switches
and
the
growing
phenomenon
of
computer
systems
in
tom
edison
had
his
computer
stolen
and
his
house
set
on
fire
by
an
arsonist
this
was
an
eventually
mortal
blow
to
tap
though
the
legendary
name
was
to
be
resurrected
in
by
a
young
kentuckian
named
ever
since
telephones
began
to
make
money
there
have
been
people
willing
to
rob
and
defraud
phone
companies
the
legions
of
petty
phone
thieves
vastly
outnumber
those
phone
phreaks
who
explore
the
system
for
the
sake
of
the
intellectual
challenge
the
new
york
metropolitan
area
long
in
the
vanguard
of
american
crime
claims
over
physical
attacks
on
pay
telephones
every
year
studied
carefully
a
modern
payphone
reveals
itself
as
a
little
fortress
carefully
designed
and
redesigned
over
generations
to
resist
zaps
of
electricity
chunks
of
ice
prybars
magnets
lockpicks
blasting
caps
public
phones
must
survive
in
a
world
of
unfriendly
greedy
people
and
a
modern
payphone
is
as
exquisitely
evolved
as
a
cactus
because
the
phone
network
the
computer
network
the
scofflaws
known
as
phone
phreaks
the
scofflaws
known
as
computer
hackers
in
practice
today
the
line
between
phreaking
and
hacking
is
very
blurred
just
as
the
distinction
between
telephones
and
computers
has
blurred
the
phone
system
has
been
digitized
and
computers
have
learned
to
talk
over
what
worse
and
this
was
the
point
of
the
jenkins
of
the
secret
service
some
hackers
have
learned
to
steal
and
some
thieves
have
learned
to
hack
despite
the
blurring
one
can
still
draw
a
few
useful
behavioral
distinctions
between
phreaks
and
hackers
hackers
are
intensely
interested
in
the
system
per
se
and
enjoy
relating
to
machines
phreaks
are
more
social
manipulating
the
system
in
a
fashion
in
order
to
get
through
to
other
human
beings
fast
cheap
and
under
the
table
phone
phreaks
love
nothing
so
much
as
bridges
illegal
conference
calls
of
ten
or
twelve
chatting
conspirators
seaboard
to
seaboard
lasting
for
many
hours
and
running
of
course
on
somebody
else
tab
preferably
a
large
corporation
as
conferences
wear
on
people
drop
out
or
simply
leave
the
phone
off
the
hook
while
they
sashay
off
to
work
or
school
or
babysitting
and
new
people
are
phoned
up
and
invited
to
join
in
from
some
other
continent
if
possible
technical
trivia
boasts
brags
lies
deceptions
weird
rumors
and
cruel
gossip
are
all
freely
exchanged
the
lowest
rung
of
is
the
theft
of
telephone
access
codes
charging
a
phone
call
to
somebody
else
stolen
number
is
of
course
a
way
of
stealing
phone
service
requiring
practically
no
technical
expertise
this
practice
has
been
very
widespread
especially
among
lonely
people
without
much
money
who
are
far
from
home
code
theft
has
flourished
especially
in
college
dorms
military
bases
and
notoriously
among
roadies
for
rock
bands
of
late
code
theft
has
spread
very
rapidly
among
third
worlders
in
the
us
who
pile
up
enormous
unpaid
bills
to
the
caribbean
south
america
and
pakistan
the
simplest
way
to
steal
is
simply
to
look
over
a
victim
shoulder
as
he
his
own
on
a
public
payphone
this
technique
is
known
as
and
is
especially
common
in
airports
bus
terminals
and
train
stations
the
code
is
then
sold
by
the
thief
for
a
few
dollars
the
buyer
abusing
the
code
has
no
computer
expertise
but
calls
his
mom
in
new
york
kingston
or
caracas
and
runs
up
a
huge
bill
with
impunity
the
losses
from
this
primitive
phreaking
activity
are
far
far
greater
than
the
monetary
losses
caused
by
hackers
in
the
until
the
introduction
of
sterner
telco
security
measures
computerized
code
theft
worked
like
a
charm
and
was
virtually
omnipresent
throughout
the
digital
underground
among
phreaks
and
hackers
alike
this
was
accomplished
through
programming
one
computer
to
try
random
code
numbers
over
the
telephone
until
one
of
them
worked
simple
programs
to
do
this
were
widely
available
in
the
underground
a
computer
running
all
night
was
likely
to
come
up
with
a
dozen
or
so
useful
hits
this
could
be
repeated
week
after
week
until
one
had
a
large
library
of
stolen
codes
nowadays
the
computerized
dialling
of
hundreds
of
numbers
can
be
detected
within
hours
and
swiftly
traced
if
a
stolen
code
is
repeatedly
abused
this
too
can
be
detected
within
a
few
hours
but
for
years
in
the
the
publication
of
stolen
codes
was
a
kind
of
elementary
etiquette
for
fledgling
hackers
the
simplest
way
to
establish
your
as
a
raider
was
to
steal
a
code
through
repeated
random
dialling
and
offer
it
to
the
community
for
use
codes
could
be
both
stolen
and
used
simply
and
easily
from
the
safety
of
one
own
bedroom
with
very
little
fear
of
detection
or
punishment
before
computers
and
their
modems
entered
american
homes
in
gigantic
numbers
phone
phreaks
had
their
own
special
telecommunications
hardware
gadget
the
famous
blue
box
this
fraud
device
now
rendered
increasingly
useless
by
the
digital
evolution
of
the
phone
system
could
trick
switching
systems
into
granting
free
access
to
lines
it
did
this
by
mimicking
the
system
own
signal
a
tone
of
hertz
steven
jobs
and
steve
wozniak
the
founders
of
apple
computer
once
dabbled
in
selling
in
college
dorms
in
california
for
many
in
the
early
days
of
phreaking
was
scarcely
perceived
as
theft
but
rather
as
a
fun
if
sneaky
way
to
use
excess
phone
capacity
harmlessly
after
all
the
lines
were
just
sitting
there
whom
did
it
hurt
really
if
you
not
damaging
the
system
and
you
not
using
up
any
tangible
resource
and
if
nobody
finds
out
what
you
did
then
what
real
harm
have
you
done
what
exactly
have
you
stolen
anyway
if
a
tree
falls
in
the
forest
and
nobody
hears
it
how
much
is
the
noise
worth
even
now
this
remains
a
rather
dicey
question
was
no
joke
to
the
phone
companies
however
indeed
when
ramparts
magazine
a
radical
publication
in
california
printed
the
wiring
schematics
necessary
to
create
a
mute
box
in
june
the
magazine
was
seized
by
police
and
pacific
bell
officials
the
mute
box
a
variant
allowed
its
user
to
receive
calls
free
of
charge
to
the
caller
this
device
was
closely
described
in
a
ramparts
article
wryly
titled
regulating
the
phone
company
in
your
home
publication
of
this
article
was
held
to
be
in
violation
of
californian
state
penal
code
section
which
outlaws
ownership
of
devices
and
the
selling
of
plans
or
instructions
for
any
instrument
apparatus
or
device
intended
to
avoid
telephone
toll
charges
issues
of
ramparts
were
recalled
or
seized
on
the
newsstands
and
the
resultant
loss
of
income
helped
put
the
magazine
out
of
business
this
was
an
ominous
precedent
for
issues
but
the
crushing
of
a
magazine
passed
without
serious
challenge
at
the
time
even
in
the
freewheeling
california
it
was
widely
felt
that
there
was
something
sacrosanct
about
what
the
phone
company
knew
that
the
telco
had
a
legal
and
moral
right
to
protect
itself
by
shutting
off
the
flow
of
such
illicit
information
most
telco
information
was
so
specialized
that
it
would
scarcely
be
understood
by
any
honest
member
of
the
public
if
not
published
it
would
not
be
missed
to
print
such
material
did
not
seem
part
of
the
legitimate
role
of
a
free
press
in
there
would
be
a
similar
attack
on
the
electronic
magazine
phrack
the
phrack
legal
case
became
a
central
issue
in
the
hacker
crackdown
and
gave
rise
to
great
controversy
phrack
would
also
be
shut
down
for
a
time
at
least
but
this
time
both
the
telcos
and
their
allies
would
pay
a
much
larger
price
for
their
actions
the
phrack
case
will
be
examined
in
detail
later
as
a
social
practice
is
still
very
much
alive
at
this
moment
today
is
thriving
much
more
vigorously
than
the
and
practice
of
computer
hacking
new
forms
of
phreaking
are
spreading
rapidly
following
new
vulnerabilities
in
sophisticated
phone
services
cellular
phones
are
especially
vulnerable
their
chips
can
be
to
present
a
false
caller
id
and
avoid
billing
doing
so
also
avoids
police
tapping
making
abuse
a
favorite
among
operations
using
pirate
cellular
phones

and
have
been
run
right
out
of
the
backs
of
cars
which
move
from

in
the
local

system
retailing
stolen
service
like
some
kind
of
demented
electronic
version
of
the
neighborhood
truck
private
phone
systems
in
large
corporations
can
be
penetrated
phreaks
a
local
company
enter
its
internal
hack
it
then
use
the
company
own
pbx
system
to
dial
back
out
over
the
public
network
causing
the
company
to
be
stuck
with
the
resulting
bill
this
technique
is
known
as
diverting
diverting
can
be
very
costly
especially
because
phreaks
tend
to
travel
in
packs
and
never
stop
talking
perhaps
the
worst
of
this
pbx
fraud
is
that
victim
companies
and
telcos
have
sued
one
another
over
the
financial
responsibility
for
the
stolen
calls
thus
enriching
not
only
shabby
phreaks
but
lawyers
systems
can
also
be
abused
phreaks
can
seize
their
own
sections
of
these
sophisticated
electronic
answering
machines
and
use
them
for
trading
codes
or
knowledge
of
illegal
techniques
abuse
does
not
hurt
the
company
directly
but
finding
supposedly
empty
slots
in
your
company
answering
machine
all
crammed
with
phreaks
eagerly
chattering
and
one
another
in
impenetrable
jargon
can
cause
sensations
of
almost
mystical
repulsion
and
dread
worse
yet
phreaks
have
sometimes
been
known
to
react
truculently
to
attempts
to
clean
up
the
system
rather
than
humbly
acquiescing
to
being
thrown
out
of
their
playground
they
may
very
well
call
up
the
company
officials
at
work
or
at
home
and
loudly
demand
free
addresses
of
their
very
own
such
bullying
is
taken
very
seriously
by
spooked
victims
acts
of
phreak
revenge
against
straight
people
are
rare
but
systems
are
especially
tempting
and
vulnerable
and
an
infestation
of
angry
phreaks
in
one
system
is
no
joke
they
can
erase
legitimate
messages
or
spy
on
private
messages
or
harass
users
with
recorded
taunts
and
obscenities
they

known
to

all
be
monitored
by
various
forms
of
radio
this
kind
of
passive
monitoring
is
spreading
explosively
today
technically
eavesdropping
on
other
people
cordless
and
cellular
is
the
area
in
phreaking
today
this
practice
strongly
appeals
to
the
lust
for
power
and
conveys
gratifying
sensations
of
technical
superiority
over
the
eavesdropping
victim
monitoring
is
rife
with
all
manner
of
tempting
evil
mischief
simple
prurient
snooping
is
by
far
the
most
common
activity
but
numbers
unwarily
spoken
over
the
phone
can
be
recorded
stolen
and
used
and
tapping
people
whether
through
active
telephone
taps
or
passive
radio
monitors
does
lend
itself
conveniently
to
activities
like
blackmail
industrial
espionage
and
political
dirty
tricks
it
should
be
repeated
that
telecommunications
fraud
the
theft
of
phone
service
causes
vastly
greater
monetary
losses
than
the
practice
of
entering
into
computers
by
stealth
hackers
are
mostly
young
suburban
american
white
males
and
exist
in
their
hundreds
but
phreaks
come
from
both
sexes
and
from
many
nationalities
ages
and
ethnic
backgrounds
and
are
flourishing
in
the
thousands
the
term
hacker
has
had
an
unfortunate
history
this
book
the
hacker
crackdown
has
little
to
say
about
hacking
in
its
finer
original
sense
the
term
can
signify
the
intellectual
exploration
of
the
highest
and
deepest
potential
of
computer
systems
hacking
can
describe
the
determination
to
make
access
to
computers
and
information
as
free
and
open
as
possible
hacking
can
involve
the
heartfelt
conviction
that
beauty
can
be
found
in
computers
that
the
fine
aesthetic
in
a
perfect
program
can
liberate
the
mind
and
spirit
this
is
hacking
as
it
was
defined
in
steven
levy
history
of
the
pioneer
computer
milieu
hackers
published
in
hackers
of
all
kinds
are
absolutely
soaked
through
with
heroic
sentiment
hackers
long
for
recognition
as
a
praiseworthy
cultural
archetype
the
postmodern
electronic
equivalent
of
the
cowboy
and
mountain
man
whether
they
deserve
such
a
reputation
is
something
for
history
to
decide
but
many
hackers
including
those
outlaw
hackers
who
are
computer
intruders
and
whose
activities
are
defined
as
criminal
actually
attempt
to
live
up
to
this
reputation
and
given
that
electronics
and
telecommunications
are
still
largely
unexplored
territories
there
is
simply
no
telling
what
hackers
might
uncover
for
some
people
this
freedom
is
the
very
breath
of
oxygen
the
inventive
spontaneity
that
makes
life
worth
living
and
that
flings
open
doors
to
marvellous
possibility
and
individual
empowerment
but
for
many
people
and
increasingly
so
the
hacker
is
an
ominous
figure
a
sociopath
ready
to
burst
out
of
his
basement
wilderness
and
savage
other
people
lives
for
his
own
anarchical
convenience
any
form
of
power
without
responsibility
without
direct
and
formal
checks
and
balances
is
frightening
to
people
and
reasonably
so
it
should
be
frankly
admitted
that
hackers
are
frightening
and
that
the
basis
of
this
fear
is
not
irrational
fear
of
hackers
goes
well
beyond
the
fear
of
merely
criminal
activity
subversion
and
manipulation
of
the
phone
system
is
an
act
with
disturbing
political
overtones
in
america
computers
and
telephones
are
potent
symbols
of
organized
authority
and
the
technocratic
business
elite
but
there
is
an
element
in
american
culture
that
has
always
strongly
rebelled
against
these
symbols
rebelled
against
all
large
industrial
computers
and
all
phone
companies
a
certain
anarchical
tinge
deep
in
the
american
soul
delights
in
causing
confusion
and
pain
to
all
bureaucracies
including
technological
ones
there
is
sometimes
malice
and
vandalism
in
this
attitude
but
it
is
a
deep
and
cherished
part
of
the
american
national
character
the
outlaw
the
rebel
the
rugged
individual
the
pioneer
the
sturdy
jeffersonian
yeoman
the
private
citizen
resisting
interference
in
his
pursuit
of
happiness
these
are
figures
that
all
americans
recognize
and
that
many
will
strongly
applaud
and
defend
many
scrupulously
citizens
today
do
work
with
electronics
work
that
has
already
had
tremendous
social
influence
and
will
have
much
more
in
years
to
come
in
all
truth
these
talented
hardworking
mature
adult
people
are
far
more
disturbing
to
the
peace
and
order
of
the
current
status
quo
than
any
scofflaw
group
of
romantic
teenage
punk
kids
these
hackers
have
the
power
ability
and
willingness
to
influence
other
people
lives
quite
unpredictably
they
have
means
motive
and
opportunity
to
meddle
drastically
with
the
american
social
order
when
corralled
into
governments
universities
or
large
multinational
companies
and
forced
to
follow
rulebooks
and
wear
suits
and
ties
they
at
least
have
some
conventional
halters
on
their
freedom
of
action
but
when
loosed
alone
or
in
small
groups
and
fired
by
imagination
and
the
entrepreneurial
spirit
they
can
move
mountains
causing
landslides
that
will
likely
crash
directly
into
your
office
and
living
room
these
people
as
a
class
instinctively
recognize
that
a
public
politicized
attack
on
hackers
will
eventually
spread
to
them
that
the
term
hacker
once
demonized
might
be
used
to
knock
their
hands
off
the
levers
of
power
and
choke
them
out
of
existence
there
are
hackers
today
who
fiercely
and
publicly
resist
any
besmirching
of
the
noble
title
of
hacker
naturally
and
understandably
they
deeply
resent
the
attack
on
their
values
implicit
in
using
the
word
hacker
as
a
synonym
for
this
book
sadly
but
in
my
opinion
unavoidably
rather
adds
to
the
degradation
of
the
term
it
concerns
itself
mostly
with
hacking
in
its
commonest
definition
intruding
into
computer
systems
by
stealth
and
without
permission
the
term
hacking
is
used
routinely
today
by
almost
all
law
enforcement
officials
with
any
professional
interest
in
computer
fraud
and
abuse
american
police
describe
almost
any
crime
committed
with
by
through
or
against
a
computer
as
hacking
most
importantly
hacker
is
what
choose
to
call
themselves
nobody
who
hacks
into
systems
willingly
describes
himself
rarely
herself
as
a
computer
intruder
computer
trespasser
cracker
wormer
darkside
hacker
or
high
tech
street
gangster
several
other
demeaning
terms
have
been
invented
in
the
hope
that
the
press
and
public
will
leave
the
original
sense
of
the
word
alone
but
few
people
actually
use
these
terms
i
exempt
the
term
cyberpunk
which
a
few
hackers
and
law
enforcement
people
actually
do
use
the
term
cyberpunk
is
drawn
from
literary
criticism
and
has
some
odd
and
unlikely
resonances
but
like
hacker
cyberpunk
too
has
become
a
criminal
pejorative
today
in
any
case
breaking
into
computer
systems
was
hardly
alien
to
the
original
hacker
tradition
the
first
tottering
systems
of
the
required
fairly
extensive
internal
surgery
merely
to
function
their
users
invaded
the
deepest
most
arcane
recesses
of
their
operating
software
almost
as
a
matter
of
routine
computer
security
in
these
early
primitive
systems
was
at
best
an
afterthought
what
security
there
was
was
entirely
physical
for
it
was
assumed
that
anyone
allowed
near
this
expensive
arcane
hardware
would
be
a
fully
qualified
professional
expert
in
a
campus
environment
though
this
meant
that
grad
students
teaching
assistants
undergraduates
and
eventually
all
manner
of
dropouts
and
ended
up
accessing
and
often
running
the
works
universities
even
modern
universities
are
not
in
the
business
of
maintaining
security
over
information
on
the
contrary
universities
as
institutions
the
information
economy
by
many
centuries
and
are
cultural
entities
whose
reason
for
existence
purportedly
is
to
discover
truth
codify
it
through
techniques
of
scholarship
and
then
teach
it
universities
are
meant
to
pass
the
torch
of
civilization
not
just
download
data
into
student
skulls
and
the
values
of
the
academic
community
are
strongly
at
odds
with
those
of
all
information
empires
teachers
at
all
levels
from
kindergarten
up
have
proven
to
be
shameless
and
persistent
software
and
data
pirates
universities
do
not
merely
leak
information
but
vigorously
broadcast
free
thought
this
clash
of
values
has
been
fraught
with
controversy
many
hackers
of
the
remember
their
professional
apprenticeship
as
a
long
guerilla
war
against
the
uptight
information
priesthood
these
youngsters
had
to
struggle
hard
for
access
to
computing
power
and
many
of
them
were
not
above
certain
er
shortcuts
but
over
the
years
this
practice
freed
computing
from
the
sterile
reserve
of
technocrats
and
was
largely
responsible
for
the
explosive
growth
of
computing
in
general
society
especially
personal
computing
access
to
technical
power
acted
like
catnip
on
certain
of
these
youngsters
most
of
the
basic
techniques
of
computer
intrusion
password
cracking
trapdoors
backdoors
trojan
horses
were
invented
in
college
environments
in
the
in
the
early
days
of
network
computing
some
experience
at
computer
intrusion
was
to
be
in
the
informal
resume
of
most
hackers
and
many
future
industry
giants
outside
of
the
tiny
cult
of
computer
enthusiasts
few
people
thought
much
about
the
implications
of
breaking
into
computers
this
sort
of
activity
had
not
yet
been
publicized
much
less
criminalized
in
the
definitions
of
property
and
privacy
had
not
yet
been
extended
to
cyberspace
computers
were
not
yet
indispensable
to
society
there
were
no
vast
databanks
of
vulnerable
proprietary
information
stored
in
computers
which
might
be
accessed
copied
without
permission
erased
altered
or
sabotaged
the
stakes
were
low
in
the
early
days
but
they
grew
every
year
exponentially
as
computers
themselves
grew
by
the
commercial
and
political
pressures
had
become
overwhelming
and
they
broke
the
social
boundaries
of
the
hacking
subculture
hacking
had
become
too
important
to
be
left
to
the
hackers
society
was
now
forced
to
tackle
the
intangible
nature
of
cyberspace
as
in
the
new
severe
responsible
context
of
the
information
society
of
the
hacking
was
called
into
question
what
did
it
mean
to
break
into
a
computer
without
permission
and
use
its
computational
power
or
look
around
inside
its
files
without
hurting
anything
what
were
hackers
anyway
how
should
society
and
the
law
best
define
their
actions
were
they
just
browsers
harmless
intellectual
explorers
were
they
voyeurs
snoops
invaders
of
privacy
should
they
be
sternly
treated
as
potential
agents
of
espionage
or
perhaps
as
industrial
spies
or
were
they
best
defined
as
trespassers
a
very
common
teenage
misdemeanor
was
hacking
theft
of
service
after
all
intruders
were
getting
someone
computer
to
carry
out
their
orders
without
permission
and
without
paying
was
hacking
fraud
maybe
it
was
best
described
as
impersonation
the
commonest
mode
of
computer
intrusion
was
and
is
to
swipe
or
snoop
somebody
else
password
and
then
enter
the
computer
in
the
guise
of
another
person
who
is
commonly
stuck
with
the
blame
and
the
bills
perhaps
a
medical
metaphor
was
better
hackers
should
be
defined
as
sick
as
computer
addicts
unable
to
control
their
irresponsible
compulsive
behavior
but
these
weighty
assessments
meant
little
to
the
people
who
were
actually
being
judged
from
inside
the
underground
world
of
hacking
itself
all
these
perceptions
seem
quaint
wrongheaded
stupid
or
meaningless
the
most
important
of
underground
hackers
from
the
right
through
to
the
present
day
is
that
they
are
an
elite
the
struggle
in
the
underground
is
not
over
sociological
definitions
who
cares
but
for
power
knowledge
and
status
among
one
peers
when
you
are
a
hacker
it
is
your
own
inner
conviction
of
your
elite
status
that
enables
you
to
break
or
let
us
say
transcend
the
rules
it
is
not
that
all
rules
go
by
the
board
the
rules
habitually
broken
by
hackers
are
unimportant
rules
the
rules
of
dopey
greedhead
telco
bureaucrats
and
government
pests
hackers
have
their
own
rules
which
separate
behavior
which
is
cool
and
elite
from
behavior
which
is
rodentlike
stupid
and
losing
these
rules
however
are
mostly
unwritten
and
enforced
by
peer
pressure
and
tribal
feeling
like
all
rules
that
depend
on
the
unspoken
conviction
that
everybody
else
is
a
good
old
boy
these
rules
are
ripe
for
abuse
the
mechanisms
of
hacker
pressure
teletrials
and
ostracism
are
rarely
used
and
rarely
work
slander
threats
and
electronic
harassment
are
also
freely
employed
in
intrahacker
feuds
but
this
rarely
forces
a
rival
out
of
the
scene
entirely
the
only
real
solution
for
the
problem
of
an
utterly
losing
treacherous
and
rodentlike
hacker
is
to
turn
him
in
to
the
police
unlike
the
mafia
or
medellin
cartel
the
hacker
elite
can
not
simply
execute
the
bigmouths
creeps
and
troublemakers
among
their
ranks
so
they
turn
one
another
in
with
astonishing
frequency
there
is
no
tradition
of
silence
or
omerta
in
the
hacker
underworld
hackers
can
be
shy
even
reclusive
but
when
they
do
talk
hackers
tend
to
brag
boast
and
strut
almost
everything
hackers
do
is
invisible
if
they
do
brag
boast
and
strut
about
it
then
nobody
will
ever
know
if
you
do
have
something
to
brag
boast
and
strut
about
then
nobody
in
the
underground
will
recognize
you
and
favor
you
with
vital
cooperation
and
respect
the
way
to
win
a
solid
reputation
in
the
underground
is
by
telling
other
hackers
things
that
could
only
have
been
learned
by
exceptional
cunning
and
stealth
forbidden
knowledge
therefore
is
the
basic
currency
of
the
digital
underground
like
seashells
among
trobriand
islanders
hackers
hoard
this
knowledge
and
dwell
upon
it
obsessively
and
refine
it
and
bargain
with
it
and
talk
and
talk
about
it
many
hackers
even
suffer
from
a
strange
obsession
to
teach
to
spread
the
ethos
and
the
knowledge
of
the
digital
underground
they
do
this
even
when
it
gains
them
no
particular
advantage
and
presents
a
grave
personal
risk
and
when
that
risk
catches
up
with
them
they
will
go
right
on
teaching
and
preaching
to
a
new
audience
this
time
their
interrogators
from
law
enforcement
almost
every
hacker
arrested
tells
everything
he
knows
all
about
his
friends
his
mentors
his
disciples
legends
threats
horror
stories
dire
rumors
gossip
hallucinations
this
is
of
course
convenient
for
law
enforcement
except
when
law
enforcement
begins
to
believe
hacker
legendry
phone
phreaks
are
unique
among
criminals
in
their
willingness
to
call
up
law
enforcement
officials
in
the
office
at
their
homes
and
give
them
an
extended
piece
of
their
mind
it
is
hard
not
to
interpret
this
as
begging
for
arrest
and
in
fact
it
is
an
act
of
incredible
foolhardiness
police
are
naturally
nettled
by
these
acts
of
chutzpah
and
will
go
well
out
of
their
way
to
bust
these
flaunting
idiots
but
it
can
also
be
interpreted
as
a
product
of
a
so
elitist
so
closed
and
hermetic
that
electronic
police
are
simply
not
perceived
as
police
but
rather
as
enemy
phone
phreaks
who
should
be
scolded
into
behaving
decently
hackers
at
their
most
grandiloquent
perceive
themselves
as
the
elite
pioneers
of
a
new
electronic
world
attempts
to
make
them
obey
the
democratically
established
laws
of
contemporary
american
society
are
seen
as
repression
and
persecution
after
all
they
argue
if
alexander
graham
bell
had
gone
along
with
the
rules
of
the
western
union
telegraph
company
there
would
have
been
no
telephones
if
jobs
and
wozniak
had
believed
that
ibm
was
the
and
there
would
have
been
no
personal
computers
if
benjamin
franklin
and
thomas
jefferson
had
tried
to
work
within
the
system
there
would
have
been
no
united
states
not
only
do
hackers
privately
believe
this
as
an
article
of
faith
but
they
have
been
known
to
write
ardent
manifestos
about
it
here
are
some
revealing
excerpts
from
an
especially
vivid
hacker
manifesto
the
by
dr
crash
which
appeared
in
electronic
form
in
phrack
volume
issue
phile
to
fully
explain
the
true
motives
behind
hacking
we
must
first
take
a
quick
look
into
the
past
in
the
a
group
of
mit
students
built
the
first
modern
computer
system
this
wild
rebellious
group
of
young
men
were
the
first
to
bear
the
name
the
systems
that
they
developed
were
intended
to
be
used
to
solve
world
problems
and
to
benefit
all
of
mankind
as
we
can
see
this
has
not
been
the
case
the
computer
system
has
been
solely
in
the
hands
of
big
businesses
and
the
government
the
wonderful
device
meant
to
enrich
life
has
become
a
weapon
which
dehumanizes
people
to
the
government
and
large
businesses
people
are
no
more
than
disk
space
and
the
government
use
computers
to
arrange
aid
for
the
poor
but
to
control
nuclear
death
weapons
the
average
american
can
only
have
access
to
a
small
microcomputer
which
is
worth
only
a
fraction
of
what
they
pay
for
it
the
businesses
keep
the
true
equipment
away
from
the
people
behind
a
steel
wall
of
incredibly
high
prices
and
bureaucracy
it
is
because
of
this
state
of
affairs
that
hacking
was
born
of
course
the
government
does
want
the
monopoly
of
technology
broken
so
they
have
outlawed
hacking
and
arrest
anyone
who
is
caught
the
phone
company
is
another
example
of
technology
abused
and
kept
from
people
with
high
prices
hackers
often
find
that
their
existing
equipment
due
to
the
monopoly
tactics
of
computer
companies
is
inefficient
for
their
purposes
due
to
the
exorbitantly
high
prices
it
is
impossible
to
legally
purchase
the
necessary
equipment
this
need
has
given
still
another
segment
of
the
fight
credit
carding
carding
is
a
way
of
obtaining
the
necessary
goods
without
paying
for
them
it
is
again
due
to
the
companies
stupidity
that
carding
is
so
easy
and
shows
that
the
world
businesses
are
in
the
hands
of
those
with
considerably
less
technical
than
we
the
hackers
hacking
must
continue
we
must
train
newcomers
to
the
art
of
hacking
and
whatever
you
do
continue
the
fight
whether
you
know
it
or
not
if
you
are
a
hacker
you
are
a
revolutionary
do
worry
you
on
the
right
side
the
defense
of
carding
is
rare
most
hackers
regard
theft
as
poison
to
the
underground
a
sleazy
and
immoral
effort
that
worse
yet
is
hard
to
get
away
with
nevertheless
manifestos
advocating
theft
the
deliberate
crashing
of
computer
systems
and
even
acts
of
violent
physical
destruction
such
as
vandalism
and
arson
do
exist
in
the
underground
these
boasts
and
threats
are
taken
quite
seriously
by
the
police
and
not
every
hacker
is
an
abstract
platonic
some
few
are
quite
experienced
at
picking
locks
robbing
and
breaking
and
entering
buildings
hackers
vary
in
their
degree
of
hatred
for
authority
and
the
violence
of
their
rhetoric
but
at
a
bottom
line
they
are
scofflaws
they
do
regard
the
current
rules
of
electronic
behavior
as
respectable
efforts
to
preserve
law
and
order
and
protect
public
safety
they
regard
these
laws
as
immoral
efforts
by
soulless
corporations
to
protect
their
profit
margins
and
to
crush
dissidents
stupid
people
including
police
businessmen
politicians
and
journalists
simply
have
no
right
to
judge
the
actions
of
those
possessed
of
genius
intentions
and
technical
expertise
hackers
are
generally
teenagers
and
college
kids
not
engaged
in
earning
a
living
they
often
come
from
fairly
backgrounds
and
are
markedly
except
that
is
when
it
comes
to
computer
equipment
anyone
motivated
by
greed
for
mere
money
as
opposed
to
the
greed
for
power
knowledge
and
status
is
swiftly
as
a
minded
breadhead
whose
interests
can
only
be
corrupt
and
contemptible
having
grown
up
in
the
and
the
young
bohemians
of
the
digital
underground
regard
straight
society
as
awash
in
plutocratic
corruption
where
everyone
from
the
president
down
is
for
sale
and
whoever
has
the
gold
makes
the
rules
interestingly
there
a
image
of
this
attitude
on
the
other
side
of
the
conflict
the
police
are
also
one
of
the
most
markedly
groups
in
american
society
motivated
not
by
mere
money
but
by
ideals
of
service
justice
and
of
course
their
own
brand
of
specialized
knowledge
and
power
remarkably
the
propaganda
war
between
cops
and
hackers
has
always
involved
angry
allegations
that
the
other
side
is
trying
to
make
a
sleazy
buck
hackers
consistently
sneer
that
prosecutors
are
angling
for
cushy
jobs
as
telco
lawyers
and
that
police
are
aiming
to
cash
in
later
as
consultants
in
the
private
sector
for
their
part
police
publicly
conflate
all
hacking
crimes
with
robbing
payphones
with
crowbars
allegations
of
monetary
losses
from
computer
intrusion
are
notoriously
inflated
the
act
of
illicitly
copying
a
document
from
a
computer
is
morally
equated
with
directly
robbing
a
company
of
say
half
a
million
dollars
the
teenage
computer
intruder
in
possession
of
this
proprietary
document
has
certainly
not
sold
it
for
such
a
sum
would
likely
have
little
idea
how
to
sell
it
at
all
and
quite
probably
does
even
understand
what
he
has
he
has
not
made
a
cent
in
profit
from
his
felony
but
is
still
morally
equated
with
a
thief
who
has
robbed
the
church
poorbox
and
lit
out
for
brazil
police
want
to
believe
that
all
hackers
are
thieves
it
is
a
tortuous
and
almost
unbearable
act
for
the
american
justice
system
to
put
people
in
jail
because
they
want
to
learn
things
which
are
forbidden
for
them
to
know
in
an
american
context
almost
any
pretext
for
punishment
is
better
than
jailing
people
to
protect
certain
restricted
kinds
of
information
nevertheless
policing
information
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
struggle
against
hackers
this
dilemma
is
well
exemplified
by
the
remarkable
activities
of
emmanuel
goldstein
editor
and
publisher
of
a
print
magazine
known
as
the
hacker
quarterly
goldstein
was
an
english
major
at
long
island
state
university
of
new
york
in
the
when
he
became
involved
with
the
local
college
radio
station
his
growing
interest
in
electronics
caused
him
to
drift
into
yippie
tap
circles
and
thus
into
the
digital
underground
where
he
became
a
his
magazine
publishes
techniques
of
computer
intrusion
and
telephone
exploration
as
well
as
gloating
exposes
of
telco
misdeeds
and
governmental
failings
goldstein
lives
quietly
and
very
privately
in
a
large
crumbling
victorian
mansion
in
setauket
new
york
the
seaside
house
is
decorated
with
telco
decals
chunks
of
driftwood
and
the
basic
of
a
hippie
he
is
unmarried
mildly
unkempt
and
survives
mostly
on
tv
dinners
and
eaten
straight
out
of
the
bag
goldstein
is
a
man
of
considerable
charm
and
fluency
with
a
brief
disarming
smile
and
the
kind
of
pitiless
stubborn
thoroughly
recidivist
integrity
that
america
electronic
police
find
genuinely
alarming
goldstein
took
his
or
handle
from
a
character
in
orwell
which
may
be
taken
correctly
as
a
symptom
of
the
gravity
of
his
sociopolitical
worldview
he
is
not
himself
a
practicing
computer
intruder
though
he
vigorously
abets
these
actions
especially
when
they
are
pursued
against
large
corporations
or
governmental
agencies
nor
is
he
a
thief
for
he
loudly
scorns
mere
theft
of
phone
service
in
favor
of
exploring
and
manipulating
the
system
he
is
probably
best
described
and
understood
as
a
dissident
weirdly
goldstein
is
living
in
modern
america
under
conditions
very
similar
to
those
of
former
east
european
intellectual
dissidents
in
other
words
he
flagrantly
espouses
a
that
is
deeply
and
irrevocably
opposed
to
the
system
of
those
in
power
and
the
police
the
values
in
are
generally
expressed
in
terms
that
are
ironic
sarcastic
paradoxical
or
just
downright
confused
but
there
no
mistaking
their
radically
tenor
holds
that
technical
power
and
specialized
knowledge
of
any
kind
obtainable
belong
by
right
in
the
hands
of
those
individuals
brave
and
bold
enough
to
discover
them
by
whatever
means
necessary
devices
laws
or
systems
that
forbid
access
and
the
free
spread
of
knowledge
are
provocations
that
any
free
and
hacker
should
relentlessly
attack
the
privacy
of
governments
corporations
and
other
soulless
technocratic
organizations
should
never
be
protected
at
the
expense
of
the
liberty
and
free
initiative
of
the
individual
however
in
our
contemporary
workaday
world
both
governments
and
corporations
are
very
anxious
indeed
to
police
information
which
is
secret
proprietary
restricted
confidential
copyrighted
patented
hazardous
illegal
unethical
embarrassing
or
otherwise
sensitive
this
makes
goldstein
persona
non
grata
and
his
philosophy
a
threat
very
little
about
the
conditions
of
goldstein
daily
life
would
astonish
say
vaclav
havel
we
may
note
in
passing
that
president
havel
once
had
his
confiscated
by
the
czechoslovak
police
goldstein
lives
by
samizdat
acting
as
a
for
the
underground
while
challenging
the
to
abide
by
their
own
stated
rules
freedom
of
speech
and
the
first
amendment
goldstein
thoroughly
looks
and
acts
the
part
of
with
ringlets
and
a
piratical
black
set
at
a
rakish
angle
he
often
shows
up
like
banquo
ghost
at
meetings
of
computer
professionals
where
he
listens
quietly
and
taking
thorough
notes
computer
professionals
generally
meet
publicly
and
find
it
very
difficult
to
rid
themselves
of
goldstein
and
his
ilk
without
extralegal
and
unconstitutional
actions
sympathizers
many
of
them
quite
respectable
people
with
responsible
jobs
admire
goldstein
attitude
and
surreptitiously
pass
him
information
an
unknown
but
presumably
large
proportion
of
goldstein
readership
are
telco
security
personnel
and
police
who
are
forced
to
subscribe
to
to
stay
abreast
of
new
developments
in
hacking
they
thus
find
themselves
paying
this
guy
rent
while
grinding
their
teeth
in
anguish
a
situation
that
would
have
delighted
abbie
hoffman
one
of
goldstein
few
idols
goldstein
is
probably
the
public
representative
of
the
hacker
underground
today
and
certainly
the
police
regard
him
as
a
fagin
a
corrupter
of
youth
and
speak
of
him
with
untempered
loathing
he
is
quite
an
accomplished
gadfly
after
the
martin
luther
king
day
crash
of
goldstein
for
instance
adeptly
rubbed
salt
into
the
wound
in
the
pages
of
yeah
it
was
fun
for
the
phone
phreaks
as
we
watched
the
network
crumble
he
admitted
cheerfully
but
it
was
also
an
ominous
sign
of
to
come
some
at
t
people
aided
by
but
ignorant
media
were
spreading
the
notion
that
many
companies
had
the
same
software
and
therefore
could
face
the
same
problem
someday
wrong
this
was
entirely
an
at
t
software
deficiency
of
course
other
companies
could
face
entirely
different
software
problems
but
then
so
too
could
at
t
after
a
technical
discussion
of
the
system
failings
the
long
island
went
on
to
offer
thoughtful
criticism
to
the
gigantic
multinational
hundreds
of
professionally
qualified
engineers
what
we
do
know
is
how
a
major
force
in
communications
like
at
t
could
be
so
sloppy
what
happened
to
backups
sure
computer
systems
go
down
all
the
time
but
people
making
phone
calls
are
not
the
same
as
people
logging
on
to
computers
we
must
make
that
distinction
it
not
acceptable
for
the
phone
system
or
any
other
essential
service
to
down
if
we
continue
to
trust
technology
without
understanding
it
we
can
look
forward
to
many
variations
on
this
theme
at
t
owes
it
to
its
customers
to
be
prepared
to
instantly
switch
to
another
network
if
something
strange
and
unpredictable
starts
occurring
the
news
here
is
so
much
the
failure
of
a
computer
program
but
the
failure
of
at
t
entire
structure
the
very
idea
of
this
this
person
offering
advice
about
at
t
entire
structure
is
more
than
some
people
can
easily
bear
how
dare
this
dictate
what
is
or
is
acceptable
behavior
from
at
t
especially
when
he
publishing
in
the
very
same

schematic
diagrams
for
creating
various
signalling

unavailable
to
the
public

what

you
drop
a

down
your
local

or
through
different
long
distance

carriers
advises
contributor
upsetter
in
how
to
build
a
signal
box
if
you
experiment
systematically
and
keep
good
records
you
will
surely
discover
something
interesting
this
is
of
course
the
scientific
method
generally
regarded
as
a
praiseworthy
activity
and
one
of
the
flowers
of
modern
civilization
one
can
indeed
learn
a
great
deal
with
this
sort
of
structured
intellectual
activity
telco
employees
regard
this
mode
of
exploration
as
akin
to
flinging
sticks
of
dynamite
into
their
pond

see

maelstrom
of
corporate
crime
and
governmental
corruption
occasionally
tempered
with
ignorance
to
read
a
few
issues
in
a
row
is
to
enter
a
nightmare
akin
to
solzhenitsyn
somewhat
tempered
by
the
fact
that
is
often
extremely
funny
goldstein
did
not
become
a
target
of
the
hacker
crackdown
though
he
protested
loudly
eloquently
and
publicly
about
it
and
it
added
considerably
to
his
fame
it
was
not
that
he
is
not
regarded
as
dangerous
because
he
is
so
regarded
goldstein
has
had
brushes
with
the
law
in
the
past
in
a
bulletin
board
computer
was
seized
by
the
fbi
and
some
software
on
it
was
formally
declared
a
burglary
tool
in
the
form
of
a
computer
program
but
goldstein
escaped
direct
repression
in
because
his
magazine
is
printed
on
paper
and
recognized
as
subject
to
constitutional
freedom
of
the
press
protection
as
was
seen
in
the
ramparts
case
this
is
far
from
an
absolute
guarantee
still
as
a
practical
matter
shutting
down
by
would
create
so
much
legal
hassle
that
it
is
simply
unfeasible
at
least
for
the
present
throughout
both
goldstein
and
his
magazine
were
peevishly
thriving
instead
the
crackdown
of
would
concern
itself
with
the
computerized
version
of
forbidden
data
the
crackdown
itself
first
and
foremost
was
about
bulletin
board
systems
bulletin
board
systems
most
often
known
by
the
ugly
and
acronym
bbs
are
the
of
the
digital
underground
boards
were
also
central
to
law
enforcement
tactics
and
strategy
in
the
hacker
crackdown
a
bulletin
board
system
can
be
formally
defined
as
a
computer
which
serves
as
an
information
and
passing
center
for
users
over
the
through
the
use
of
modems
a
modem
or
demodulator
is
a
device
which
translates
the
digital
impulses
of
computers
into
audible
analog
telephone
signals
and
vice
versa
modems
connect
computers
to
phones
and
thus
to
each
other
mainframe
computers
have
been
connected
since
the
but
personal
computers
run
by
individuals
out
of
their
homes
were
first
networked
in
the
late
the
board
created
by
ward
christensen
and
randy
suess
in
february
in
chicago
illinois
is
generally
regarded
as
the
first
bulletin
board
system
worthy
of
the
name
boards
run
on
many
different
machines
employing
many
different
kinds
of
software
early
boards
were
crude
and
buggy
and
their
managers
known
as
system
operators
or
sysops
were
technical
experts
who
wrote
their
own
software
but
like
most
everything
else
in
the
world
of
electronics
boards
became
faster
cheaper
and
generally
far
more
sophisticated
throughout
the
they
also
moved
swiftly
out
of
the
hands
of
pioneers
and
into
those
of
the
general
public
by
there
were
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
boards
in
america
by
it
was
calculated
vaguely
that
there
were
about
boards
in
the
us
with
uncounted
thousands
overseas
computer
bulletin
boards
are
unregulated
enterprises
running
a
board
is
a
proposition
basically
anybody
with
a
computer
modem
software
and
a
can
start
a
board
with
equipment
and
free
software
the
price
of
a
board
might
be
quite
small
less
than
it
would
take
to
publish
a
magazine
or
even
a
decent
pamphlet
entrepreneurs
eagerly
sell
software
and
will
coach
nontechnical
amateur
sysops
in
its
use
boards
are
not
presses
they
are
not
magazines
or
libraries
or
phones
or
cb
radios
or
traditional
cork
bulletin
boards
down
at
the
local
laundry
though
they
have
some
passing
resemblance
to
those
earlier
media
boards
are
a
new
medium
they
may
even
be
a
large
number
of
new
media
consider
these
unique
characteristics
boards
are
cheap
yet
they
can
have
a
national
even
global
reach
boards
can
be
contacted
from
anywhere
in
the
global
telephone
network
at
no
cost
to
the
person
running
the
board
the
caller
pays
the
phone
bill
and
if
the
caller
is
local
the
call
is
free
boards
do
not
involve
an
editorial
elite
addressing
a
mass
audience
the
sysop
of
a
board
is
not
an
exclusive
publisher
or
writer
he
is
managing
an
electronic
salon
where
individuals
can
address
the
general
public
play
the
part
of
the
general
public
and
also
exchange
private
mail
with
other
individuals
and
the
conversation
on
boards
though
fluid
rapid
and
highly
interactive
is
not
spoken
but
written
it
is
also
relatively
anonymous
sometimes
completely
so
and
because
boards
are
cheap
and
ubiquitous
regulations
and
licensing
requirements
would
likely
be
practically
unenforceable
it
would
almost
be
easier
to
regulate
inspect
and
license
the
content
of
private
mail
probably
more
so
since
the
mail
system
is
operated
by
the
federal
government
boards
are
run
by
individuals
independently
entirely
at
their
own
whim
for
the
sysop
the
cost
of
operation
is
not
the
primary
limiting
factor
once
the
investment
in
a
computer
and
modem
has
been
made
the
only
steady
cost
is
the
charge
for
maintaining
a
phone
line
or
several
phone
lines
the
primary
limits
for
sysops
are
time
and
energy
boards
require
upkeep
new
users
are
generally
validated
they
must
be
issued
individual
passwords
and
called
at
home
by
so
that
their
identity
can
be
verified
obnoxious
users
who
exist
in
plenty
must
be
chided
or
purged
proliferating
messages
must
be
deleted
when
they
grow
old
so
that
the
capacity
of
the
system
is
not
overwhelmed
and
software
programs
if
such
things
are
kept
on
the
board
must
be
examined
for
possible
computer
viruses
if
there
is
a
financial
charge
to
use
the
board
increasingly
common
especially
in
larger
and
fancier
systems
then
accounts
must
be
kept
and
users
must
be
billed
and
if
the
board
crashes
a
very
common
occurrence
then
repairs
must
be
made
boards
can
be
distinguished
by
the
amount
of
effort
spent
in
regulating
them
first
we
have
the
completely
open
board
whose
sysop
is
off
chugging
brews
and
watching
while
his
users
generally
degenerate
over
time
into
peevish
anarchy
and
eventual
silence
second
comes
the
supervised
board
where
the
sysop
breaks
in
every
once
in
a
while
to
tidy
up
calm
brawls
issue
announcements
and
rid
the
community
of
dolts
and
troublemakers
third
is
the
heavily
supervised
board
which
sternly
urges
adult
and
responsible
behavior
and
swiftly
edits
any
message
considered
offensive
impertinent
illegal
or
irrelevant
and
last
comes
the
completely
edited
electronic
publication
which
is
presented
to
a
silent
audience
which
is
not
allowed
to
respond
directly
in
any
way
boards
can
also
be
grouped
by
their
degree
of
anonymity
there
is
the
completely
anonymous
board
where
everyone
uses
pseudonyms
handles
and
even
the
sysop
is
unaware
of
the
user
true
identity
the
sysop
himself
is
likely
pseudonymous
on
a
board
of
this
type
second
and
rather
more
common
is
the
board
where
the
sysop
knows
or
thinks
he
knows
the
true
names
and
addresses
of
all
users
but
the
users
do
know
one
another
names
and
may
not
know
his
third
is
the
board
where
everyone
has
to
use
real
names
and
roleplaying
and
pseudonymous
posturing
are
forbidden
boards
can
be
grouped
by
their
immediacy
are
boards
linking
several
users
together
over
several
different
simultaneously
so
that
people
exchange
messages
at
the
very
moment
that
they
type
many
large
boards
feature
chat
capabilities
along
with
other
services
less
immediate
boards
perhaps
with
a
single
phoneline
store
messages
serially
one
at
a
time
and
some
boards
are
only
open
for
business
in
daylight
hours
or
on
weekends
which
greatly
slows
response
a
network
of
boards
such
as
fidonet
can
carry
electronic
mail
from
board
to
board
continent
to
continent
across
huge
distances
but
at
a
relative
snail
pace
so
that
a
message
can
take
several
days
to
reach
its
target
audience
and
elicit
a
reply
boards
can
be
grouped
by
their
degree
of
community
some
boards
emphasize
the
exchange
of
private
electronic
mail
others
emphasize
public
postings
and
may
even
purge
people
who
lurk
merely
reading
posts
but
refusing
to
openly
participate
some
boards
are
intimate
and
neighborly
others
are
frosty
and
highly
technical
some
are
little
more
than
storage
dumps
for
software
where
users
download
and
upload
programs
but
interact
among
themselves
little
if
at
all
boards
can
be
grouped
by
their
ease
of
access
some
boards
are
entirely
public
others
are
private
and
restricted
only
to
personal
friends
of
the
sysop
some
boards
divide
users
by
status
on
these
boards
some
users
especially
beginners
strangers
or
children
will
be
restricted
to
general
topics
and
perhaps
forbidden
to
post
favored
users
though
are
granted
the
ability
to
post
as
they
please
and
to
stay
as
long
as
they
like
even
to
the
disadvantage
of
other
people
trying
to
call
in
users
can
be
given
access
to
hidden
areas
in
the
board
such
as
topics
private
discussions
valuable
software
favored
users
may
even
become
remote
sysops
with
the
power
to
take
remote
control
of
the
board
through
their
own
home
computers
quite
often
remote
sysops
end
up
doing
all
the
work
and
taking
formal
control
of
the
enterprise
despite
the
fact
that
physically
located
in
someone
else
house
sometimes
several
share
power
and
boards
can
also
be
grouped
by
size
massive
nationwide
commercial
networks
such
as
compuserve
delphi
genie
and
prodigy
are
run
on
mainframe
computers
and
are
generally
not
considered
boards
though
they
share
many
of
their
characteristics
such
as
electronic
mail
discussion
topics
libraries
of
software
and
persistent
and
growing
problems
with
issues
some
private
boards
have
as
many
as
thirty
and
quite
sophisticated
hardware
and
then
there
are
tiny
boards
boards
vary
in
popularity
some
boards
are
huge
and
crowded
where
users
must
claw
their
way
in
against
a
constant
others
are
huge
and
empty
there
are
few
things
sadder
than
a
formerly
flourishing
board
where
no
one
posts
any
longer
and
the
dead
conversations
of
vanished
users
lie
about
gathering
digital
dust
some
boards
are
tiny
and
intimate
their
telephone
numbers
intentionally
kept
confidential
so
that
only
a
small
number
can
log
on
and
some
boards
are
underground
boards
can
be
mysterious
entities
the
activities
of
their
users
can
be
hard
to
differentiate
from
conspiracy
sometimes
they
are
conspiracies
boards
have
harbored
or
have
been
accused
of
harboring
all
manner
of
fringe
groups
and
have
abetted
or
been
accused
of
abetting
every
manner
of
sleazy
radical
and
criminal
activity
there
are
satanist
boards
nazi
boards
pornographic
boards
pedophile
boards
dealing
boards
anarchist
boards
communist
boards
gay
and
lesbian
boards
these
exist
in
great
profusion
many
of
them
quite
lively
with
histories
religious
cult
boards
evangelical
boards
witchcraft
boards
hippie
boards
punk
boards
skateboarder
boards
boards
for
ufo
believers
there
may
well
be
boards
for
serial
killers
airline
terrorists
and
professional
assassins
there
is
simply
no
way
to
tell
boards
spring
up
flourish
and
disappear
in
large
numbers
in
most
every
corner
of
the
developed
world
even
apparently
innocuous
public
boards
can
and
sometimes
do
harbor
secret
areas
known
only
to
a
few
and
even
on
the
vast
public
commercial
services
private
mail
is
very
private
and
quite
possibly
criminal
boards
cover
most
every
topic
imaginable
and
some
that
are
hard
to
imagine
they
cover
a
vast
spectrum
of
social
activity
however
all
board
users
do
have
something
in
common
their
possession
of
computers
and
phones
naturally
computers
and
phones
are
primary
topics
of
conversation
on
almost
every
board

hackers

business
as
a
cultural

the
thing
approaches

underground
groups

be

from
independent
cultures

their
habit

the
digital
underground
which
specializes

relies
very
heavily
on
language
to
distinguish
itself
as
can
be
seen
from
this
list
they
make
heavy
use

parody

mockery

they

mock

it
quite
possible
that
this
entire
list
refers
to
as
few
as
a
thousand
people
it
is
not
a
complete
list
of
underground
groups
there
has
never
been
such
a
list
and
there
never
will
be
groups
rise

people
pass

out
are
ostracized

bored
are
busted
by
police
or
are
cornered
by
telco
security
and
presented
with
huge
bills
many
underground
groups
are
software
pirates
warez
who
might
break
copy
protection
and
pirate
programs
but
likely
would
dare
to
intrude
on
a
it
is
hard
to
estimate
the
true
population
of
the
digital
underground
there
is
constant
turnover
most
hackers
start
young
come
and
go
then
drop
out
at
age
the
age
of
college
graduation
and
a
large
majority
of
hackers
access
pirate
boards
adopt
a
handle
swipe
software
and
perhaps
abuse
a
or
two
while
never
actually
joining
the
elite
some
professional
informants
who
make
it
their
business
to
retail
knowledge
of
the
underground
to
paymasters
in
private
corporate
security
have
estimated
the
hacker
population
at
as
high
as
fifty
thousand
this
is
likely
highly
inflated
unless
one
counts
every
single
teenage
software
pirate
and
petty
thief
my
best
guess
is
about
people
of
these
i
would
guess
that
as
few
as
a
hundred
are
truly
elite
active
computer
intruders
skilled
enough
to
penetrate
sophisticated
systems
and
truly
to
worry
corporate
security
and
law
enforcement
another
interesting
speculation
is
whether
this
group
is
growing
or
not
young
teenage
hackers
are
often
convinced
that
hackers
exist
in
vast
swarms
and
will
soon
dominate
the
cybernetic
universe
older
and
wiser
veterans
perhaps
as
wizened
as
or
years
old
are
convinced
that
the
glory
days
are
long
gone
that
the
cops
have
the
underground
number
now
and
that
kids
these
days
are
and
just
want
to
play
nintendo
my
own
assessment
is
that
computer
intrusion
as
a
act
of
intellectual
exploration
and
mastery
is
in
slow
decline
at
least
in
the
united
states
but
that
electronic
fraud
especially
telecommunication
crime
is
growing
by
leaps
and
bounds
one
might
find
a
useful
parallel
to
the
digital
underground
in
the
drug
underground
there
was
a
time
now
by
historical
revisionism
when
bohemians
freely
shared
joints
at
concerts
and
hip
marijuana
dealers
might
turn
people
on
just
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
a
long
stoned
conversation
about
the
doors
and
allen
ginsberg
now
drugs
are
increasingly
verboten
except
in
a
world
of
highly
addictive
drugs
over
years
of
disenchantment
and
police
harassment
a
vaguely
ideological
drug
underground
has
relinquished
the
business
of
to
a
far
more
savage
criminal
this
is
not
a
pleasant
prospect
to
contemplate
but
the
analogy
is
fairly
compelling
what
does
an
underground
board
look
like
what
distinguishes
it
from
a
standard
board
it
is
necessarily
the
conversation
hackers
often
talk
about
common
board
topics
such
as
hardware
software
sex
science
fiction
current
events
politics
movies
personal
gossip
underground
boards
can
best
be
distinguished
by
their
files
or
philes
texts
which
teach
the
techniques
and
ethos
of
the
underground
these
are
prized
reservoirs
of
forbidden
knowledge
some
are
anonymous
but
most
proudly
bear
the
handle
of
the
hacker
who
has
created
them
and
his
group
affiliation
if
he
has
one

american
males
who
can
remember
their
teenage
years
will
recognize
that
the
notion
of
building
a
flamethrower
in
your
garage
is
an
incredibly
idea
actually
building
a
flamethrower
in
your
garage
however
is
fraught
with
discouraging
difficulty
stuffing
gunpowder
into
a
flashlight
so
as
to
blow
the
arm
off
your
can
be
a
thing
of
dark
beauty
to
contemplate
actually
committing
assault
by
explosives
will
earn
you
the
sustained
attention
of
the
federal
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
some
people
however
will
actually
try
these
plans
a
determinedly
murderous
american
teenager
can
probably
buy
or
steal
a
handgun
far
more
easily
than
he
can
brew
fake
napalm
in
the
kitchen
sink
nevertheless
if
temptation
is
spread
before
people
a
certain
number
will
succumb
and
a
small
minority
will
actually
attempt
these
stunts
a
large
minority
of
that
small
minority
will
either
fail
or
quite
likely
maim
themselves
since
these
philes
have
not
been
checked
for
accuracy
are
not
the
product
of
professional
experience
and
are
often
highly
fanciful
but
the
gloating
menace
of
these
philes
is
not
to
be
entirely
dismissed
hackers
may
not
be
serious
about
bombing
if
they
were
we
would
hear
far
more
about
exploding
flashlights
homemade
bazookas
and
gym
teachers
poisoned
by
chlorine
and
potassium
however
hackers
are
very
serious
about
forbidden
knowledge
they
are
possessed
not
merely
by
curiosity
but
by
a
positive
lust
to
know
the
desire
to
know
what
others
do
is
scarcely
new
but
the
intensity
of
this
desire
as
manifested
by
these
young
technophilic
denizens
of
the
information
age
may
in
fact
be
new
and
may
represent
some
basic
shift
in
social
values
a
harbinger
of
what
the
world
may
come
to
as
society
lays
more
and
more
value
on
the
possession
assimilation
and
retailing
of
information
as
a
basic
commodity
of
daily
life
there
have
always
been
young
men
with
obsessive
interests
in
these
topics
never
before
however
have
they
been
able
to
network
so
extensively
and
easily
and
to
propagandize
their
interests
with
impunity
to
random
teachers
will
recognize
that
there
always
one
in
a
crowd
but
when
the
one
in
a
crowd
escapes
control
by
jumping
into
the
and
becomes
a
hundred
such
kids
all
together
on
a
board
then
trouble
is
brewing
visibly
the
urge
of
authority
to
do
something
even
something
drastic
is
hard
to
resist
and
in
authority
did
something
in
fact
authority
did
a
great
deal
the
process
by
which
boards
create
hackers
goes
something
like
this
a
youngster
becomes
interested
in
computers
usually
computer
games
he
hears
from
friends
that
bulletin
boards
exist
where
games
can
be
obtained
for
free
many
computer
games
are
freeware
not
copyrighted
invented
simply
for
the
love
of
it
and
given
away
to
the
public
some
of
these
games
are
quite
good
he
bugs
his
parents
for
a
modem
or
quite
often
uses
his
parents
modem
the
world
of
boards
suddenly
opens
up
computer
games
can
be
quite
expensive
real
for
a
kid
but
pirated
games
stripped
of
copy
protection
are
cheap
or
free
they
are
also
illegal
but
it
is
very
rare
almost
unheard
of
for
a
software
pirate
to
be
prosecuted
once
cracked
of
its
copy
protection
the
program
being
digital
data
becomes
infinitely
reproducible
even
the
instructions
to
the
game
any
manuals
that
accompany
it
can
be
reproduced
as
text
files
or
photocopied
from
legitimate
sets
other
users
on
boards
can
give
many
useful
hints
in
tactics
and
a
youngster
with
an
infinite
supply
of
free
computer
games
can
certainly
cut
quite
a
swath
among
his
friends
and
boards
are
pseudonymous
no
one
need
know
that
fourteen
years
old
with
a
little
practice
at
subterfuge
you
can
talk
to
adults
about
adult
things
and
be
accepted
and
taken
seriously
you
can
even
pretend
to
be
a
girl
or
an
old
man
or
anybody
you
can
imagine
if
you
find
this
kind
of
deception
gratifying
there
is
ample
opportunity
to
hone
your
ability
on
boards
but
local
boards
can
grow
stale
and
almost
every
board
maintains
a
list
of
to
other
boards
some
in
distant
tempting
exotic
locales
who
knows
what
they
up
to
in
oregon
or
alaska
or
florida
or
california
it
very
easy
to
find
out
just
order
the
modem
to
call
through
its
software
nothing
to
this
just
typing
on
a
keyboard
the
same
thing
you
would
do
for
most
any
computer
game
the
machine
reacts
swiftly
and
in
a
few
seconds
you
are
talking
to
a
bunch
of
interesting
people
on
another
seaboard
and
yet
the
bills
for
this
trivial
action
can
be
staggering
just
by
going
with
your
fingers
you
may
have
saddled
your
parents
with
four
hundred
bucks
in
charges
and
gotten
chewed
out
but
good
that
hardly
seems
fair
how
horrifying
to
have
made
friends
in
another
state
and
to
be
deprived
of
their
company
and
their
software
just
because
telephone
companies
demand
absurd
amounts
of
money
how
painful
to
be
restricted
to
boards
in
one
own
area
code
what
the
heck
is
an
area
code
anyway
and
what
makes
it
so
special
a
few
grumbles
complaints
and
innocent
questions
of
this
sort
will
often
elicit
a
sympathetic
reply
from
another
board
user
someone
with
some
stolen
codes
to
hand
you
dither
a
while
knowing
this
is
quite
right
then
you
make
up
your
mind
to
try
them
anyhow
and
they
work
suddenly
you
doing
something
even
your
parents
ca
do
six
months
ago
you
were
just
some
kid
now
you
the
crimson
flash
of
area
code
you
bad
you
nationwide
maybe
you
stop
at
a
few
abused
codes
maybe
you
decide
that
boards
are
all
that
interesting
after
all
that
it
wrong
not
worth
the
risk
but
maybe
you
wo
the
next
step
is
to
pick
up
your
own
program
to
learn
to
generate
your
own
stolen
codes
this
was
dead
easy
five
years
ago
much
harder
to
get
away
with
nowadays
but
not
yet
impossible
and
these
dialling
programs
are
not
complex
or
intimidating
some
are
as
small
as
twenty
lines
of
software
now
you
too
can
share
codes
you
can
trade
codes
to
learn
other
techniques
if
you
smart
enough
to
catch
on
and
obsessive
enough
to
want
to
bother
and
ruthless
enough
to
start
seriously
bending
rules
then
you
get
better
fast
you
start
to
develop
a
you
move
up
to
a
heavier
class
of
board
a
board
with
a
bad
attitude
the
kind
of
board
that
naive
dopes
like
your
classmates
and
your
former
self
have
never
even
heard
of
you
pick
up
the
jargon
of
phreaking
and
hacking
from
the
board
you
read
a
few
of
those
anarchy
philes
and
man
you
never
realized
you
could
be
a
real
outlaw
without
ever
leaving
your
bedroom
you
still
play
other
computer
games
but
now
you
have
a
new
and
bigger
game
this
one
will
bring
you
a
different
kind
of
status
than
destroying
even
eight
zillion
lousy
space
invaders
hacking
is
perceived
by
hackers
as
a
game
this
is
not
an
entirely
unreasonable
or
sociopathic
perception
you
can
win
or
lose
at
hacking
succeed
or
fail
but
it
never
feels
real
it
not
simply
that
imaginative
youngsters
sometimes
have
a
hard
time
telling
from
real
life
cyberspace
is
not
real
real
things
are
physical
objects
like
trees
and
shoes
and
cars
hacking
takes
place
on
a
screen
words
are
physical
numbers
even
telephone
numbers
and
credit
card
numbers
are
physical
sticks
and
stones
may
break
my
bones
but
data
will
never
hurt
me
computers
simulate
reality
like
computer
games
that
simulate
tank
battles
or
dogfights
or
spaceships
simulations
are
just
and
the
stuff
in
computers
is
not
real
consider
this
if
hacking
is
supposed
to
be
so
serious
and
and
dangerous
then
how
come
kids
have
computers
and
modems
you
would
give
a
nine
year
old
his
own
car
or
his
own
rifle
or
his
own
chainsaw
those
things
are
real
people
underground
are
perfectly
aware
that
the
game
is
frowned
upon
by
the
powers
that
be
word
gets
around
about
busts
in
the
underground
publicizing
busts
is
one
of
the
primary
functions
of
pirate
boards
but
they
also
promulgate
an
attitude
about
them
and
their
own
idiosyncratic
ideas
of
justice
the
users
of
underground
boards
wo
complain
if
some
guy
is
busted
for
crashing
systems
spreading
viruses
or
stealing
money
by
they
may
shake
their
heads
with
a
sneaky
grin
but
they
wo
openly
defend
these
practices
but
when
a
kid
is
charged
with
some
theoretical
amount
of
theft
for
instance
because
he
sneaked
into
a
computer
and
copied
something
and
kept
it
in
his
house
on
a
floppy
disk
this
is
regarded
as
a
sign
of
from
prosecutors
a
sign
that
they
drastically
mistaken
the
immaterial
game
of
computing
for
their
real
and
boring
everyday
world
of
fatcat
corporate
money
it
as
if
big
companies
and
their
lawyers
think
that
computing
belongs
to
them
and
they
can
retail
it
with
price
stickers
as
if
it
were
boxes
of
laundry
soap
but
pricing
information
is
like
trying
to
price
air
or
price
dreams
well
anybody
on
a
pirate
board
knows
that
computing
can
be
and
ought
to
be
free
pirate
boards
are
little
independent
worlds
in
cyberspace
and
they
do
belong
to
anybody
but
the
underground
underground
boards
are
brought
to
you
by
procter
gamble
to
log
on
to
an
underground
board
can
mean
to
experience
liberation
to
enter
a
world
where
for
once
money
is
everything
and
adults
do
have
all
the
answers
let
sample
another
vivid
hacker
manifesto
here
are
some
excerpts
from
the
conscience
of
a
hacker
by
the
mentor
from
phrack
volume
one
issue
phile
i
made
a
discovery
today
i
found
a
computer
wait
a
second
this
is
cool
it
does
what
i
want
it
to
if
it
makes
a
mistake
it
because
i
screwed
it
up
not
because
it
does
like
me
and
then
it
happened
door
opened
to
a
world
rushing
through
the
phone
line
like
heroin
through
an
addict
veins
an
electronic
pulse
is
sent
out
a
refuge
from
incompetencies
is
sought
a
board
is
found
is
it
is
where
i
belong
i
know
everyone
here
if
i
never
met
them
never
talked
to
them
may
never
hear
from
them
again
i
know
you
all
this
is
our
world
now
world
of
the
electron
and
the
switch
the
beauty
of
the
baud
we
make
use
of
a
service
already
existing
without
paying
for
what
could
be
if
it
was
run
by
profiteering
gluttons
and
you
call
us
criminals
we
explore
you
call
us
criminals
we
seek
after
knowledge
you
call
us
criminals
we
exist
without
skin
color
without
nationality
without
religious
bias
you
call
us
criminals
you
build
atomic
bombs
you
wage
wars
you
murder
cheat
and
lie
to
us
and
try
to
make
us
believe
that
it
for
our
own
good
yet
we
the
criminals
yes
i
am
a
criminal
my
crime
is
that
of
curiosity
my
crime
is
that
of
judging
people
by
what
they
say
and
think
not
what
they
look
like
my
crime
is
that
of
outsmarting
you
something
that
you
will
never
forgive
me
for
there
have
been
underground
boards
almost
as
long
as
there
have
been
boards
one
of
the
first

became
a
stronghold
of
the

after
going

most
notoriously

the
singular
distinction
of
becoming
the
most
vilified
american
phreak
and
hacker
ever
angry
underground
associates
fed
up
with
condor
peevish
behavior
turned
him
in
to
police
along
with
a
heaping
of
outrageous
hacker
legendry
as
a
result
condor
was
kept
in
solitary
confinement
for
seven
months
for
fear
that
he
might
start
world
war
three
by
triggering
missile
silos
from

of

technically
curious
entered

emerged

in

these

by

and
with

the

exploded
it
seemed
that
every

in

had
demanded

gotten

most
of

some

boards
where
hackers
could
exchange
social

try
to
figure
out

the

going

six
thousand

internet
hacking
was
a
standard
for
the
underground
elite
most
any
underground
board
not
hopelessly
lame
and
would
feature
a
complete
run
of
phrack
and
possibly
the

of
the

the

the
obscene
and
raucous
cult
of
the
dead

magazine
pirate
the
syndicate
reports
and
perhaps
the
highly
activist
times
incorporated
possession
of
phrack
on
one
board
was
prima
facie
evidence
of
a
bad
attitude
phrack
was
seemingly
everywhere
aiding
abetting
and
spreading
the
underground
ethos
and
this
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
corporate
security
or
the
police
we
now
come
to
the
touchy
subject
of
police
and
boards
police
do
in
fact
own
boards
in
there
were
boards
in
california
colorado
florida
georgia
idaho
michigan
missouri
texas
and
virginia
boards
such
as
crime
bytes
crimestoppers
all
points
and
police
officers
as
private
computer
enthusiasts
ran
their
own
boards
in
arizona
california
colorado
connecticut
florida
missouri
maryland
new
mexico
north
carolina
ohio
tennessee
and
texas
police
boards
have
often
proved
helpful
in
community
relations
sometimes
crimes
are
reported
on
police
boards
sometimes
crimes
are
committed
on
police
boards
this
has
sometimes
happened
by
accident
as
naive
hackers
blunder
onto
police
boards
and
blithely
begin
offering
telephone
codes
far
more
often
however
it
occurs
through
the
now
use
of
sting
boards
the
first
police
were
established
in
underground
tunnel
in
austin
texas
whose
sysop
sgt
robert

called
himself
pluto
the
phone
company
in
phoenix
arizona
run
by
ken
macleod
of
the
maricopa
county
sheriff
office
and
sgt
dan
pasquale
board
in
fremont
california
sysops
posed
as
hackers
and
swiftly
garnered
coteries
of
ardent
users
who
posted
codes
and
loaded
pirate
software
with
abandon
and
came
to
a
sticky
end
sting
boards
like
other
boards
are
cheap
to
operate
very
cheap
by
the
standards
of
undercover
police
operations
once
accepted
by
the
local
underground
sysops
will
likely
be
invited
into
other
pirate
boards
where
they
can
compile
more
dossiers
and
when
the
sting
is
announced
and
the
worst
offenders
arrested
the
publicity
is
generally
gratifying
the
resultant
paranoia
in
the
underground
perhaps
more
justly
described
as
a
deterrence
effect
tends
to
quell
local
lawbreaking
for
quite
a
while
obviously
police
do
not
have
to
beat
the
underbrush
for
hackers
on
the
contrary
they
can
go
trolling
for
them
those
caught
can
be
grilled
some
become
useful
informants
they
can
lead
the
way
to
pirate
boards
all
across
the
country
and
boards
all
across
the
country
showed
the
sticky
fingerprints
of
phrack
and
of
that
loudest
and
most
flagrant
of
all
underground
groups
the
legion
of
doom
the
term
legion
of
doom
came
from
comic
books
the
legion
of
doom
a
conspiracy
of
costumed
villains
headed
by
the
criminal
mastermind
lex
luthor
gave
superman
a
lot
of
graphic
trouble
for
a
number
of
decades
of
course
superman
that
exemplar
of
truth
justice
and
the
american
way
always
won
in
the
long
run
this
did
matter
to
the
hacker
doomsters
legion
of
doom
was
not
some
thunderous
and
evil
satanic
reference
it
was
not
meant
to
be
taken
seriously
legion
of
doom
came
from
and
was
supposed
to
be
funny
legion
of
doom
did
have
a
good
mouthfilling
ring
to
it
though
it
sounded
really
cool
other
groups
such
as
the
farmers
of
doom
closely
allied
to
lod
recognized
this
grandiloquent
quality
and
made
fun
of
it
there
was
even
a
hacker
group
called
justice
league
of
america
named
after
superman
club
of
crimefighting
superheros
but
they
did
last

lex

who
was
under

formed
the
legion

a
cosmos
expert
cosmos

the
central

a
telco

network
lex
would
eventually
become
quite
a
dab
hand
at
breaking
into
ibm
mainframes
but
although
everyone
liked
lex
and
admired
his
attitude
he
was
not
considered
a
truly
accomplished
computer
intruder
nor
was
he
the
mastermind
of
the

never

constantly
in

up
or
formed
offshoots
early
on

a
few

who
became

the

to
have
an
instinctive
understanding
that
the
way
to
real

in
the
underground
lay
through
covert
publicity
lod
were
flagrant
not
only
was
it
one
of
the
earliest
groups
but
the
members
took
pains
to
widely
distribute
their
illicit
knowledge
some
lod
members
like
the
mentor
were
close
to
evangelical
about
it
legion
of
doom
technical
journal
began
to
show
up
on
boards
throughout
the
underground
lod
technical
journal
was
named
in
cruel
parody
of
the
ancient
and
honored
at
t
technical
journal
the
material
in
these
two
publications
was
quite
similar
much
of
it
adopted
from
public
journals
and
discussions
in
the
telco
community
and
yet
the
predatory
attitude
of
lod
made
even
its
most
innocuous
data
seem
deeply
sinister
an
outrage
a
clear
and
present
danger
to
see
why
this
should
be
let
consider
the
following
invented
paragraphs
as
a
kind
of
thought
experiment
a
fred

not
the

of

you
want
your

reading
the

however

identical
it
is
public
information
presented
before
the
federal

in
an

it

on

the

is
a
matter
of
great
public
pride
to
bellcore
however
when
bellcore
publicly
announces
a
project
of
this
kind
it
expects
a
certain
attitude
from
the
public
something
along
the
lines
of
gosh
wow
you
guys
are
great
keep
that
up
whatever
it
is
certainly
not
cruel
mimickry
and
outrageous
speculations
about
possible

holes
now
put
yourself
in
the
place
of
a
policeman
confronted
by
an
outraged
parent
or
telco
official
with
a
copy
of

b
this
citizen
to
his
horror
has
discovered
a
local
carrying
outrageous
stuff
like
b
which
his
son
is
examining
with
a
deep
and
unhealthy
interest
if
b
were
printed
in
a
book
or
magazine
you
as
an
american
law
enforcement
officer
would
know
that
it
would
take
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
trouble
to
do
anything
about
it
but
it
does
take
technical
genius
to
recognize
that
if
there
a
computer
in
your
area
harboring
stuff
like
b
there
going
to
be
trouble
in
fact
if
you
ask
around
any
cop
will
tell
you
straight
out
that
boards
with
stuff
like
b
are
the
source
of
trouble
and
the
worst
source
of
trouble
on
boards
are
the
ringleaders
inventing
and
spreading
stuff
like
b
if
it
were
for
these
jokers
there
would

did

his
phoenix

when
they
did
run

themselves
they
showed
up
on
other
people
boards
to
brag
boast
and
strut
and
where
they
themselves
did
go
their
philes
went
carrying
evil
knowledge
and
an
even
more
evil
attitude
as
early
as
the
police
were
under
the
vague
impression
that
everyone
in
the
underground
was
legion
of
doom
lod
was
never
that
large
considerably
smaller
than
either
metal
communications
or
the
administration
for
instance
but
lod
got
tremendous
press
especially
in
phrack
which
at
times
read
like
an
lod
fan
magazine
and
phrack
was
everywhere
especially
in
the
offices
of
telco
security
you
could
get
busted
as
a
phone
phreak
a
hacker
or
even
a
lousy
codes
kid
or
warez
dood
without
the
cops
asking
if
you
were
lod
this
was
a
difficult
charge
to
deny
as
lod
never
distributed
membership
badges
or
laminated
id
cards
if
they
had
they
would
likely
have
died
out
quickly
for
turnover
in
their
membership
was
considerable
lod
was
less
a
than
an
ongoing
lod
was
the
gang
that
refused
to
die
by
lod
had
ruled
for
ten
years
and
it
seemed
weird
to
police
that
they
were
continually
busting
people
who
were
only
sixteen
years
old
all
these
teenage
were
pleading
the
tiresome
hacker
litany
of
just
curious
no
criminal
intent
somewhere
at
the
center
of
this
conspiracy
there
had
to
be
some
serious
adult
masterminds
not
this
seemingly
endless
supply
of
myopic
suburban
white
kids
with
high
sats
and
funny
haircuts
there
was
no
question
that
most
any
american
hacker
arrested
would
know
lod
they
knew
the
handles
of
contributors
to
lod
tech
journal
and
were
likely
to
have
learned
their
craft
through
lod
boards
and
lod
activism
but
they
never
met
anyone
from
lod
even
some
of
the
rotating
cadre
who
were
actually
and
formally
in
lod
knew
one
another
only
by
and
pseudonyms
this
was
a
highly
unconventional
profile
for
a
criminal
conspiracy
computer
networking
and
the
rapid
evolution
of
the
digital
underground
made
the
situation
very
diffuse
and
confusing
furthermore
a
big
reputation
in
the
digital
underground
did
not
coincide
with
one
willingness
to
commit
crimes
instead
reputation
was
based
on
cleverness
and
technical
mastery
as
a
result
it
often
seemed
that
the
heavier
the
hackers
were
the
less
likely
they
were
to
have
committed
any
kind
of
common
easily
prosecutable
crime
there
were
some
hackers
who
could
really
steal
and
there
were
hackers
who
could
really
hack
but
the
two
groups
did
seem
to
overlap
much
if
at
all
for
instance
most
people
in
the
underground
looked
up
to
emmanuel
goldstein
of
as
a
hacker
demigod
but
goldstein
publishing
activities
were
entirely
legal
goldstein
just
printed
dodgy
stuff
and
talked
about
politics
he
did
even
hack
when
you
came
right
down
to
it
goldstein
spent
half
his
time
complaining
that
computer
security
was
strong
enough
and
ought
to
be
drastically
improved
across
the
board
truly
hackers
those
with
serious
technical
skills
who
had
earned
the
respect
of
the
underground
never
stole
money
or
abused
credit
cards
sometimes
they
might
abuse
but
often
they
seemed
to
get
all
the
free
they
wanted
without
leaving
a
trace
of
any
kind
the
best
hackers
the
most
powerful
and
technically
accomplished
were
not
professional
fraudsters
they
raided
computers
habitually
but
would
alter
anything
or
damage
anything
they
did
even
steal
computer
equipment
most
had
messing
with
hardware
and
could
get
all
the
cheap
secondhand
equipment
they
wanted
the
hottest
hackers
unlike
the
teenage
wannabes
were
snobs
about
fancy
or
expensive
hardware
their
machines
tended
to
be
raw
digital
full
of
custom
that
they
cobbled
together
out
of
chickenwire
memory
chips
and
spit
some
were
adults
computer
software
writers
and
consultants
by
trade
and
making
quite
good
livings
at
it
some
of
them
actually
worked
for
the
phone
company
and
for
those
the
hackers
actually
found
under
the
skirts
of
ma
bell
there
would
be
little
mercy
in
it
has
long
been
an
article
of
faith
in
the
underground
that
the
best
hackers
never
get
caught
they
far
too
smart
supposedly
they
never
get
caught
because
they
never
boast
brag
or
strut
these
demigods
may
read
underground
boards
with
a
condescending
smile
but
they
never
say
anything
there
the
best
hackers
according
to
legend
are
adult
computer
professionals
such
as
mainframe
system
administrators
who
already
know
the
ins
and
outs
of
their
particular
brand
of
security
even
the
best
hacker
ca
break
in
to
just
any
computer
at
random
the
knowledge
of
security
holes
is
too
specialized
varying
widely
with
different
software
and
hardware
but
if
people
are
employed
to
run
say
a
unix
mainframe
or
a
machine
then
they
tend
to
learn
security
from
the
inside
out
armed
with
this
knowledge
they
can
look
into
most
anybody
else
unix
or
vms
without
much
trouble
or
risk
if
they
want
to
and
according
to
hacker
legend
of
course
they
want
to
so
of
course
they
do
they
just
do
make
a
big
deal
of
what
they
done
so
nobody
ever
finds
out
it
is
also
an
article
of
faith
in
the
underground
that
professional
telco
people
phreak
like
crazed
weasels
of
course
they
spy
on
madonna
phone
calls
i
mean
would
you
of
course
they
give
themselves
free
distance
why
the
hell
should
they
pay
they
running
the
whole
shebang
it
has
as
a
third
matter
long
been
an
article
of
faith
that
any
hacker
caught
can
escape
serious
punishment
if
he
confesses
how
he
did
it
hackers
seem
to
believe
that
governmental
agencies
and
large
corporations
are
blundering
about
in
cyberspace
like
eyeless
jellyfish
or
cave
salamanders
they
feel
that
these
large
but
pathetically
stupid
organizations
will
proffer
up
genuine
gratitude
and
perhaps
even
a
security
post
and
a
big
salary
to
the
intruder
who
will
deign
to
reveal
to
them
the
supreme
genius
of
his
modus
operandi
in
the
case
of
longtime
lod
member
this
actually
happened
more
or
less
had
led
michigan
bell
a
merry
chase
and
when
captured
in
he
turned
out
to
be
a
bright
and
apparently
physically
harmless
young
fanatic
fascinated
by
phones
there
was
no
chance
in
hell
that
would
actually
repay
the
enormous
and
largely
theoretical
sums
in
service
that
he
had
accumulated
from
michigan
bell
he
could
always
be
indicted
for
fraud
or
but
there
seemed
little
real
point
in
this
he
physically
damaged
any
computer
he
just
plead
guilty
and
he
likely
get
the
usual
and
in
the
meantime
it
would
be
a
big
hassle
for
michigan
bell
just
to
bring
up
the
case
but
if
kept
on
the
payroll
he
might
at
least
keep
his
fellow
hackers
at
bay
there
were
uses
for
him
for
instance
a
contrite
was
featured
on
michigan
bell
internal
posters
sternly
warning
employees
to
shred
their
trash
he
always
gotten
most
of
his
best
inside
info
from
trashing
raiding
telco
dumpsters
for
useful
data
indiscreetly
thrown
away
he
signed
these
posters
too
had
become

want
to
screw
up

no

what

of

they
did
stick
together

my
did
they
brag
urvile

were
for
this

probably
more
so
even
than
the
quite
accomplished
the
georgia

knew
all
about

though
relative
in
the

of

they
were
considered
some
of

into
the
hairiest

around

had
the
good

to

the

to

and
were
warily
prepared
for
most
anything
even
michigan
bell
a
division
of
the
ameritech
rboc
at
least
had
the
elementary
sense
to
hire
their
own

as
a
useful
scarecrow
but
bellsouth
even
though
their
corporate
proclaimed
them
to
have
everything
you
expect
from
a
leader
were
pathetic
when
rumor
about
lod
mastery
of
georgia
switching
network
got
around
to
bellsouth
through
bellcore
and
telco
security
scuttlebutt
they
at
first
refused
to
believe
it
if
you
paid
serious
attention
to
every
rumor
out
and
about
these
hacker
kids
you
would
hear
all
kinds
of
wacko
nonsense
that
the
national
security
agency
monitored
all
american
phone
calls
that
the
cia
and
dea
tracked
traffic
on
with
programs
that
the
condor
could
start
world
war
iii
from
a
payphone
if
there
were
hackers
into
bellsouth
then
how
come
nothing
had
happened
nothing
had
been
hurt
bellsouth
machines
were
crashing
bellsouth
was
suffering
especially
badly
from
fraud
bellsouth
customers
were
complaining
bellsouth
was
headquartered
in
atlanta
ambitious
metropolis
of
the
new
sunbelt
and
bellsouth
was
upgrading
its
network
by
leaps
and
bounds
digitizing
the
works
left
right
and
center
they
could
hardly
be
considered
sluggish
or
naive
bellsouth
technical
expertise
was
second
to
none
thank
you
kindly
but
then
came
the
florida
business
on
june
callers
to
the
palm
beach
county
probation
department
in
delray
beach
florida
found
themselves
involved
in
a
remarkable
discussion
with
a
worker
named
tina
in
new
york
state
somehow
any
call
to
this
probation
office
near
miami
was
instantly
and
magically
transported
across
state
lines
at
no
extra
charge
to
the
user
to
a
pornographic
hotline
hundreds
of
miles
away
this
practical
joke
may
seem
utterly
hilarious
at
first
hearing
and
indeed
there
was
a
good
deal
of
chuckling
about
it
in
phone
phreak
circles
including
the
autumn
issue
of
but
for
southern
bell
the
division
of
the
bellsouth
rboc
supplying
local
service
for
florida
georgia
north
carolina
and
south
carolina
this
was
a
smoking
gun
for
the
first
time
ever
a
computer
intruder
had
broken
into
a
bellsouth
central
office
switching
station
and
it
or
so
bellsouth
thought
in
june
actually
lod
members
had
been
frolicking
harmlessly
in
bellsouth
switches
since
september
the
stunt
of
june
a
number
through
manipulation
of
a
switching
station
was
child
play
for
hackers
as
accomplished
as
the
georgia
wing
of
lod
switching
calls
interstate
sounded
like
a
big
deal
but
it
took
only
four
lines
of
code
to
accomplish
this
an
easy
yet
more
discreet
stunt
would
be
to
another
number
to
your
own
house
if
you
were
careful
and
considerate
and
changed
the
software
back
later
then
not
a
soul
would
know
except
you
and
whoever
you
had
bragged
to
about
it
as
for
bellsouth
what
they
did
know
would
hurt
them
except
now
somebody
had
blown
the
whole
thing
wide
open
and
bellsouth
knew
a
now
alerted
and
considerably
paranoid
bellsouth
began
searching
switches
right
and
left
for
signs
of
impropriety
in
that
hot
summer
of
no
fewer
than
bellsouth
employees
were
put
on
shifts
hours
a
day
for
two
solid
months
poring
over
records
and
monitoring
computers
for
any
sign
of
phony
access
these
overworked
experts
were
known
as
bellsouth
intrusion
task
force
what
the
investigators
found
astounded
them
proprietary
telco
databases
had
been
manipulated
phone
numbers
had
been
created
out
of
thin
air
with
no
users
names
and
no
addresses
and
perhaps
worst
of
all
no
charges
and
no
records
of
use
the
new
digital
remob
remote
observation
diagnostic
feature
had
been
extensively
tampered
with
hackers
had
learned
to
reprogram
remob
software
so
that
they
could
listen
in
on
any
call
at
their
leisure
they
were
using
telco
property
to
spy
the
electrifying
news
went
out
throughout
law
enforcement
in
it
had
never
really
occurred
to
anyone
at
bellsouth
that
their
prized
and
digital
could
be
people
seemed
utterly
amazed
that
anyone
could
have
the
nerve
of
course
these
switching
stations
were
computers
and
everybody
knew
hackers
liked
to
break
into
computers
but
telephone
computers
were
different
from
normal
people
computers
the
exact
reason
why
these
computers
were
different
was
rather
it
certainly
was
the
extent
of
their
security
the
security
on
these
bellsouth
computers
was
lousy
the
aimsx
computers
for
instance
did
even
have
passwords
but
there
was
no
question
that
bellsouth
strongly
felt
that
their
computers
were
very
different
indeed
and
if
there
were
some
criminals
out
there
who
had
not
gotten
that
message
bellsouth
was
determined
to
see
that
message
taught
after
all
a
switching
station
was
no
mere
bookkeeping
system
for
some
local
chain
of
florists
public
service
depended
on
these
stations
public
safety
depended
on
these
stations
and
hackers
lurking
in
there
or
remobbing
could
spy
on
anybody
in
the
local
area
they
could
spy
on
telco
officials
they
could
spy
on
police
stations
they
could
spy
on
local
offices
of
the
secret
service
in
electronic
cops
and
began
using
and
secured
lines
it
only
made
sense
there
was
no
telling
who
was
into
those
systems
whoever
they
were
they
sounded
scary
this
was
some
new
level
of
antisocial
daring
could
be
west
german
hackers
in
the
pay
of
the
kgb
that
too
had
seemed
a
weird
and
farfetched
notion
until
clifford
stoll
had
poked
and
prodded
a
sluggish
washington
bureaucracy
into
investigating
a
computer
intrusion
that
turned
out
to
be
exactly
that
hackers
in
the
pay
of
the
kgb
stoll
the
systems
manager
for
an
internet
lab
in
berkeley
california
had
ended
up
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
nork
times
proclaimed
a
national
hero
in
the
first
true
story
of
international
computer
espionage
stoll
counterspy
efforts
which
he
related
in
a
bestselling
book
the
cuckoo
egg
in
had
established
the
credibility
of
as
a
possible
threat
to
national
security
the
united
states
secret
service
does
mess
around
when
it
suspects
a
possible
action
by
a
foreign
intelligence
apparat
the
secret
service
and
secured
lines
put
a
tremendous
kink
in
law
enforcement
ability
to
operate
freely
to
get
the
word
out
cooperate
prevent
misunderstandings
nevertheless
scarcely
seemed
the
time
for
if
the
police
and
secret
service
themselves
were
not
operationally
secure
then
how
could
they
reasonably
demand
measures
of
security
from
private
enterprise
at
least
the
inconvenience
made
people
aware
of
the
seriousness
of
the
threat
if
there
was
a
final
spur
needed
to
get
the
police
off
the
dime
it
came
in
the
realization
that
the
emergency
system
was
vulnerable
the
system
has
its
own
specialized
software
but
it
is
run
on
the
same
digital
switching
systems
as
the
rest
of
the
telephone
network
is
not
physically
different
from
normal
telephony
but
it
is
certainly
culturally
different
because
this
is
the
area
of
telephonic
cyberspace
reserved
for
the
police
and
emergency
services
your
average
policeman
may
not
know
much
about
hackers
or
computer
people
are
weird
even
computer
cops
are
rather
weird
the
stuff
they
do
is
hard
to
figure
out
but
a
threat
to
the
system
is
anything
but
an
abstract
threat
if
the
system
goes
people
can
die
imagine
being
in
a
staggering
to
a
punching
and
hearing
tina
pick
up
the
line
somewhere
in
new
york
the
situation
no
longer
comical
somehow
and
was
it
possible
no
question
hackers
had
attacked
systems
before
phreaks
can
systems
just
by
siccing
a
bunch
of
on
them
in
tandem
dialling
them
over
and
over
until
they
clog
that
very
crude
and
but
it
still
a
serious
business
the
time
had
come
for
action
it
was
time
to
take
stern
measures
with
the
underground
it
was
time
to
start
picking
up
the
dropped
threads
the
loose
edges
the
bits
of
braggadocio
here
and
there
it
was
time
to
get
on
the
stick
and
start
putting
serious
casework
together
hackers
invisible
they
thought
they
were
invisible
but
the
truth
was
they
had
just
been
tolerated
too
long
under
sustained
police
attention
in
the
summer
of
the
digital
underground
began
to
unravel
as
never
before
the
first
big
break
in
the
case
came
very
early
on
july
the
following
month
the
perpetrator
of
the
tina
switch
was
caught
and
confessed
his
name
was
fry
guy
a
in
indiana
fry
guy
had
been
a
very
wicked
young
man
fry
guy
had
earned
his
handle
from
a
stunt
involving
french
fries
fry
guy
had
filched
the
of
a
local
macdonald
manager
and
had
to
the
macdonald
mainframe
on
the
sprint
telenet
system
posing
as
the
manager
fry
guy
had
altered
macdonald
records
and
given
some
teenage
friends
of
his
generous
raises
he
had
not
been
caught
emboldened
by
success
fry
guy
moved
on
to
abuse
fry
guy
was
quite
an
accomplished
talker
with
a
gift
for
social
engineering
if
you
can
do
social
engineering
impersonation
conning
scamming
then
card
abuse
comes
easy
getting
away
with
it
in
the
long
run
is
another
question
fry
guy
had
run
across
urvile
of
the
legion
of
doom
on
the
altos
chat
board
in
bonn
germany
altos
chat
was
a
sophisticated
board
accessible
through
computer
networks
like
bitnet
tymnet
and
telenet
altos
was
much
frequented
by
members
of
chaos
computer
club
two
chaos
hackers
who
hung
out
on
altos
jaeger
and
pengo
had
been
the
central
villains
of
clifford
stoll
cuckoo
egg
case
consorting
in
east
berlin
with
a
spymaster
from
the
kgb
and
breaking
into
american
computers
for
hire
through
the
internet
when
lod
members
learned
the
story
of
jaeger
depredations
from
stoll
book
they
were
rather
less
than
impressed
technically
speaking
on
lod
own
favorite
board
of
the
moment
black
ice
lod
members
bragged
that
they
themselves
could
have
done
all
the
chaos
in
a
week
flat
nevertheless
lod
were
grudgingly
impressed
by
the
chaos
rep
the
sheer
daring
of
anarchist
hackers
who
had
rubbed
shoulders
with
the
fearsome
of
international
communist
espionage
lod
members
sometimes
traded
bits
of
knowledge
with
friendly
german
hackers
on
altos
phone
numbers
for
vulnerable
computers
in
georgia
for
instance
dutch
and
british
phone
phreaks
and
the
australian
clique
of
phoenix
nom
and
electron
were
altos
regulars
too
in
underground
circles
to
hang
out
on
altos
was
considered
the
sign
of
an
elite
dude
a
sophisticated
hacker
of
the
international
digital
fry
guy
quickly
learned
how
to
raid
information
from
agencies
he
had
over
a
hundred
stolen
numbers
in
his
notebooks
and
upwards
of
a
thousand
swiped
access
codes
he
knew
how
to
get
onto
altos
and
how
to
talk
the
talk
of
the
underground
convincingly
he
now
wheedled
knowledge
of
tricks
from
urvile
on
the
altos
system
combining
these
two
forms
of
knowledge
enabled
fry
guy
to
bootstrap
his
way
up
to
a
new
form
of
first
he
snitched
credit
card
numbers
from
computers
the
data
he
copied
included
names
addresses
and
phone
numbers
of
the
random
then
fry
guy
impersonating
a
called
up
western
union
and
asked
for
a
cash
advance
on
his
credit
card
western
union
as
a
security
guarantee
would
call
the
customer
back
at
home
to
verify
the
transaction
but
just
as
he
had
switched
the
florida
probation
office
to
tina
in
new
york
fry
guy
switched
the
number
to
a
local
there
he
would
lurk
in
wait
muddying
his
trail
by
routing
and
the
call
through
switches
as
far
away
as
canada
when
the
call
came
through
he
would
boldly
or
con
the
western
union
people
pretending
to
be
the
legitimate
since
he
answered
the
proper
phone
number
the
deception
was
not
very
hard
western
union
money
was
then
shipped
to
a
confederate
of
fry
guy
in
his
home
town
in
indiana
fry
guy
and
his
cohort
using
lod
techniques
stole
six
thousand
dollars
from
western
union
between
december
and
july
they
also
dabbled
in
ordering
delivery
of
stolen
goods
through
fry
guy
was
intoxicated
with
success
the
fantasized
wildly
to
hacker
rivals
boasting
that
he
used
money
to
hire
himself
a
big
limousine
and
had
driven
with
a
groupie
from
his
favorite
band
motley
crue
armed
with
knowledge
power
and
a
gratifying
stream
of
free
money
fry
guy
now
took
it
upon
himself
to
call
local
representatives
of
indiana
bell
security
to
brag
boast
strut
and
utter
tormenting
warnings
that
his
powerful
friends
in
the
notorious
legion
of
doom
could
crash
the
national
telephone
network
fry
guy
even
named
a
date
for
the
scheme
the
fourth
of
july
a
national
holiday
this
egregious
example
of
the
syndrome
was
shortly
followed
by
fry
guy
arrest
after
the
indiana
telephone
company
figured
out
who
he
was
the
secret
service
had
dnrs
dialed
number
recorders
installed
on
his
home
phone
lines
these
devices
are
not
taps
and
record
the
substance
of
phone
calls
but
they
do
record
the
phone
numbers
of
all
calls
going
in
and
out
tracing
these
numbers
showed
fry
code
fraud
his
extensive
ties
to
pirate
bulletin
boards
and
numerous
personal
calls
to
his
lod
friends
in
atlanta
by
july
prophet
urvile
and
leftist
also
had
secret
service
dnr
pen
registers
installed
on
their
own
lines
the
secret
service
showed
up
in
force
at
fry
guy
house
on
july
to
the
horror
of
his
unsuspecting
parents
the
raiders
were
led
by
a
special
agent
from
the
secret
service
indianapolis
office
however
the
raiders
were
accompanied
and
advised
by
timothy
foley
of
the
secret
service
chicago
office
a
gentleman
about
whom
we
will
soon
be
hearing
a
great
deal
following
federal
techniques
that
had
been
standard
since
the
early
the
secret
service
searched
the
house
thoroughly
and
seized
all
of
fry
guy
electronic
equipment
and
notebooks
all
fry
guy
equipment
went
out
the
door
in
the
custody
of
the
secret
service
which
put
a
swift
end
to
his
depredations
the
usss
interrogated
fry
guy
at
length
his
case
was
put
in
the
charge
of
deborah
daniels
the
federal
us
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
indiana
fry
guy
was
charged
with
eleven
counts
of
computer
fraud
unauthorized
computer
access
and
wire
fraud
the
evidence
was
thorough
and
irrefutable
for
his
part
fry
guy
blamed
his
corruption
on
the
legion
of
doom
and
offered
to
testify
against
them
fry
guy
insisted
that
the
legion
intended
to
crash
the
phone
system
on
a
national
holiday
and
when
at
t
crashed
on
martin
luther
king
day
this
lent
a
credence
to
his
claim
that
genuinely
alarmed
telco
security
and
the
secret
service
fry
guy
eventually
pled
guilty
on
may
on
september
he
was
sentenced
to
months
probation
and
four
hundred
community
service
he
could
have
had
it
much
worse
but
it
made
sense
to
prosecutors
to
take
it
easy
on
this
teenage
minor
while
zeroing
in
on
the
notorious
kingpins
of
the
legion
of
doom
but
the
case
against
lod
had
nagging
flaws
despite
the
best
effort
of
investigators
it
was
impossible
to
prove
that
the
legion
had
crashed
the
phone
system
on
january
because
they
in
fact
had
done
so
the
investigations
of
did
show
that
certain
members
of
the
legion
of
doom
had
achieved
unprecedented
power
over
the
telco
switching
stations
and
that
they
were
in
active
conspiracy
to
obtain
more
power
yet
investigators
were
privately
convinced
that
the
legion
of
doom
intended
to
do
awful
things
with
this
knowledge
but
mere
evil
intent
was
not
enough
to
put
them
in
jail
and
although
the
atlanta
three
prophet
leftist
and
especially
urvile
had
taught
fry
guy
plenty
they
were
not
themselves
fraudsters
the
only
thing
they
stolen
was
service
and
since
done
much
of
that
through
manipulation
there
was
no
easy
way
to
judge
how
much
they
stolen
or
whether
this
practice
was
even
theft
of
any
easily
recognizable
kind
fry
guy
theft
of
codes
had
cost
the
phone
companies
plenty
the
theft
of
service
may
be
a
fairly
theoretical
loss
but
it
costs
genuine
money
and
genuine
time
to
delete
all
those
stolen
codes
and
to
new
codes
to
the
innocent
owners
of
those
corrupted
codes
the
owners
of
the
codes
themselves
are
victimized
and
lose
time
and
money
and
peace
of
mind
in
the
hassle
and
then
there
were
the
victims
to
deal
with
too
and
western
union
when
it
came
to
fry
guy
was
far
more
of
a
thief
than
lod
it
was
only
when
it
came
to
actual
computer
expertise
that
fry
guy
was
small
potatoes
the
atlanta
legion
thought
most
rules
of
cyberspace
were
for
rodents
and
losers
but
they
did
have
rules
they
never
crashed
anything
and
they
never
took
money
these
were
rough
and
rather
dubious
principles
when
it
comes
to
the
ethical
subtleties
of
cyberspace
but
they
enabled
the
atlanta
three
to
operate
with
a
relatively
clear
conscience
though
never
with
peace
of
mind
if
you
did
hack
for
money
if
you
were
robbing
people
of
actual
funds
money
in
the
bank
that
is
then
nobody
really
got
hurt
in
lod
opinion
theft
of
service
was
a
bogus
issue
and
intellectual
property
was
a
bad
joke
but
lod
had
only
elitist
contempt
for
artists
leechers
thieves
they
considered
themselves
clean
in
their
opinion
if
you
did
or
crash
any
systems
well
not
on
purpose
anyhow
accidents
can
happen
just
ask
robert
morris
then
it
was
very
unfair
to
call
you
a
vandal
or
a
cracker
when
you
were
hanging
out
with
your
pals
in
telco
security
you
could
face
them
down
from
the
higher
plane
of
hacker
morality
and
you
could
mock
the
police
from
the
supercilious
heights
of
your
hacker
quest
for
pure
knowledge
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
law
enforcement
and
telco
security
however
fry
guy
was
not
really
dangerous
the
atlanta
three
were
dangerous
it
was
the
crimes
they
were
committing
but
the
danger
the
potential
hazard
the
sheer
technical
power
lod
had
accumulated
that
had
made
the
situation
untenable
fry
guy
was
not
lod
he
never
laid
eyes
on
anyone
in
lod
his
only
contacts
with
them
had
been
electronic
core
members
of
the
legion
of
doom
tended
to
meet
physically
for
conventions
every
year
or
so
to
get
drunk
give
each
other
the
hacker
send
out
for
pizza
and
ravage
hotel
suites
fry
guy
had
never
done
any
of
this
deborah
daniels
assessed
fry
guy
accurately
as
an
lod
wannabe
nevertheless
fry
guy
crimes
would
be
directly
attributed
to
lod
in
much
future
police
propaganda
lod
would
be
described
as
a
closely
knit
group
involved
in
numerous
illegal
activities
including
stealing
and
modifying
individual
credit
histories
and
fraudulently
obtaining
money
and
property
fry
guy
did
this
but
the
atlanta
three
did
they
simply
were
into
theft
but
rather
intrusion
this
caused
a
strange
kink
in
the
prosecution
strategy
lod
were
accused
of
disseminating
information
about
attacking
computers
to
other
computer
hackers
in
an
effort
to
shift
the
focus
of
law
enforcement
to
those
other
hackers
and
away
from
the
legion
of
doom
this
last
accusation
taken
directly
from
a
press
release
by
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
sounds
particularly
one
might
conclude
at
this
point
that
investigators
would
have
been
to
go
ahead
and
shift
their
focus
from
the
legion
of
doom
maybe
they
should
concentrate
on
those
other
hackers
the
ones
who
were
actually
stealing
money
and
physical
objects
but
the
hacker
crackdown
of
was
not
a
simple
policing
action
it
was
meant
just
to
walk
the
beat
in
cyberspace
it
was
a
crackdown
a
deliberate
attempt
to
nail
the
core
of
the
operation
to
send
a
dire
and
potent
message
that
would
settle
the
hash
of
the
digital
underground
for
good
by
this
reasoning
fry
guy
was
much
more
than
the
electronic
equivalent
of
a
cheap
streetcorner
dope
dealer
as
long
as
the
masterminds
of
lod
were
still
flagrantly
operating
pushing
their
mountains
of
illicit
knowledge
right
and
left
and
whipping
up
enthusiasm
for
blatant
lawbreaking
then
there
would
be
an
infinite
supply
of
fry
guys
because
lod
were
flagrant
they
had
left
trails
everywhere
to
be
picked
up
by
law
enforcement
in
new
york
indiana
florida
texas
arizona
missouri
even
australia
but
war
on
the
legion
of
doom
was
led
out
of
illinois
by
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
the
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
led
by
federal
prosecutor
william
cook
had
started
in
and
had
swiftly
become
one
of
the
most
aggressive
local
dedicated
units
chicago
was
a
natural
home
for
such
a
group
the
world
first
computer
system
had
been
invented
in
illinois
the
state
of
illinois
had
some
of
the
nation
first
and
sternest
computer
crime
laws
illinois
state
police
were
markedly
alert
to
the
possibilities
of
crime
and
electronic
fraud
and
william
cook
in
particular
was
a
rising
star
in
electronic
he
and
his
fellow
federal
prosecutors
at
the
attorney
office
in
chicago
had
a
tight
relation
with
the
secret
service
especially
agent
timothy
foley
while
cook
and
his
department
of
justice
colleagues
plotted
strategy
foley
was
their
man
on
the
street
throughout
the
the
federal
government
had
given
prosecutors
an
armory
of
new
untried
legal
tools
against
computer
crime
cook
and
his
colleagues
were
pioneers
in
the
use
of
these
new
statutes
in
the
of
the
federal
courtroom
on
october
the
us
senate
had
passed
the
computer
fraud
and
abuse
act
unanimously
but
there
were
pitifully
few
convictions
under
this
statute
cook
group
took
their
name
from
this
statute
since
they
were
determined
to
transform
this
powerful
but
rather
theoretical
act
of
congress
into
a
engine
of
legal
destruction
against
computer
fraudsters
and
scofflaws
it
was
not
a
question
of
merely
discovering
crimes
investigating
them
and
then
trying
and
punishing
their
perpetrators
the
chicago
unit
like
most
everyone
else
in
the
business
already
knew
who
the
bad
guys
were
the
legion
of
doom
and
the
writers
and
editors
of
phrack
the
task
at
hand
was
to
find
some
legal
means
of
putting
these
characters
away
this
approach
might
seem
a
bit
dubious
to
someone
not
acquainted
with
the
gritty
realities
of
prosecutorial
work
but
prosecutors
do
put
people
in
jail
for
crimes
they
have
committed
they
put
people
in
jail
for
crimes
they
have
committed
that
can
be
proved
in
court
chicago
federal
police
put
al
capone
in
prison
for
fraud
chicago
is
a
big
town
with
a
tradition
on
both
sides
of
the
law
fry
guy
had
broken
the
case
wide
open
and
alerted
telco
security
to
the
scope
of
the
problem
but
fry
guy
crimes
would
not
put
the
atlanta
three
behind
bars
much
less
the
wacko
underground
journalists
of
phrack
so
on
july
the
same
day
that
fry
guy
was
raided
in
indiana
the
secret
service
descended
upon
the
atlanta
three
this
was
likely
inevitable
by
the
summer
of
law
enforcement
were
closing
in
on
the
atlanta
three
from
at
least
six
directions
at
once
first
there
were
the
leads
from
fry
guy
which
had
led
to
the
dnr
registers
being
installed
on
the
lines
of
the
atlanta
three
the
dnr
evidence
alone
would
have
finished
them
off
sooner
or
later
but
second
the
atlanta
lads
were
already
to
and
his
telco
security
sponsors
lod
contacts
with
telco
security
had
made
them
overconfident
and
even
more
boastful
than
usual
they
felt
that
they
had
powerful
friends
in
high
places
and
that
they
were
being
openly
tolerated
by
telco
security
but
bellsouth
intrusion
task
force
were
hot
on
the
trail
of
lod
and
sparing
no
effort
or
expense
the
atlanta
three
had
also
been
identified
by
name
and
listed
on
the
extensive
files
maintained
and
retailed
for
pay
by
private
security
operative
john
maxfield
of
detroit
maxfield
who
had
extensive
ties
to
telco
security
and
many
informants
in
the
underground
was
a
bete
noire
of
the
phrack
crowd
and
the
dislike
was
mutual
the
atlanta
three
themselves
had
written
articles
for
phrack
this
boastful
act
could
not
possibly
escape
telco
and
law
enforcement
attention
knightmare
a
age
hacker
from
arizona
was
a
close
friend
and
disciple
of
atlanta
lod
but
he
had
been
nabbed
by
the
formidable
arizona
organized

and
racketeering
unit
knightmare
was
on
some
of

and
was
privy
to
their
secrets
and
to
have
gail
thackeray
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
arizona
on
one
trail
was
a
dreadful
peril
for
any
hacker
and
perhaps
worst
of
all
prophet
had
committed
a
major
blunder
by
passing
an
illicitly
copied
bellsouth
to
knight
lightning
who
had
published
it
in
phrack
this
as
we
will
see
was
an
act
of
dire
consequence
for
almost
everyone
concerned
on
july
the
secret
service
showed
up
at
the
leftist
house
where
he
lived
with
his
parents
a
massive
squad
of
some
twenty
officers
surrounded
the
building
secret
service
federal
marshals
local
police
possibly
bellsouth
telco
security
it
was
hard
to
tell
in
the
crush
leftist
dad
at
work
in
his
basement
office
first
noticed
a
muscular
stranger
in
plain
clothes
crashing
through
the
back
yard
with
a
drawn
pistol
as
more
strangers
poured
into
the
house
leftist
dad
naturally
assumed
there
was
an
armed
robbery
in
progress
like
most
hacker
parents
leftist
mom
and
dad
had
only
the
vaguest
notions
of
what
their
son
had
been
up
to
all
this
time
leftist
had
a
repairing
computer
hardware
his
obsession
with
computers
seemed
a
bit
odd
but
harmless
enough
and
likely
to
produce
a
paying
career
the
sudden
overwhelming
raid
left
parents
traumatized
the
leftist
himself
had
been
out
after
work
with
his
surrounding
a
couple
of
pitchers
of
margaritas
as
he
came
trucking
on
feet
up
the
pavement
toting
a
bag
full
of
he
noticed
a
large
number
of
unmarked
cars
parked
in
his
driveway
all
the
cars
sported
tiny
microwave
antennas
the
secret
service
had
knocked
the
front
door
off
its
hinges
almost
flattening
his
mom
inside
leftist
was
greeted
by
special
agent
james
cool
of
the
us
secret
service
atlanta
office
leftist
was
flabbergasted
he
never
met
a
secret
service
agent
before
he
could
not
imagine
that
he
ever
done
anything
worthy
of
federal
attention
he
always
figured
that
if
his
activities
became
intolerable
one
of
his
contacts
in
telco
security
would
give
him
a
private
and
tell
him
to
knock
it
off
but
now
leftist
was
for
weapons
by
grim
professionals
and
his
bag
of
floppies
was
quickly
seized
he
and
his
parents
were
all
shepherded
into
separate
rooms
and
grilled
at
length
as
a
score
of
officers
scoured
their
home
for
anything
electronic
leftist
was
horrified
as
his
treasured
ibm
at
personal
computer
with
its
hard
disk
and
his
recently
purchased
with
a
whopping
hard
disk
both
went
swiftly
out
the
door
in
secret
service
custody
they
also
seized
all
his
disks
all
his
notebooks
and
a
tremendous
booty
in
dogeared
telco
documents
that
leftist
had
snitched
out
of
trash
dumpsters
leftist
figured
the
whole
thing
for
a
big
misunderstanding
he
never
been
into
military
computers
he
was
a
spy
or
a
communist
he
was
just
a
good
ol
georgia
hacker
and
now
he
just
wanted
all
these
people
out
of
the
house
but
it
seemed
they
would
go
until
he
made
some
kind
of
statement
and
so
he
levelled
with
them
and
that
leftist
said
later
from
his
federal
prison
camp
in
talladega
alabama
was
a
big
mistake
the
atlanta
area
was
unique
in
that
it
had
three
members
of
the
legion
of
doom
who
actually
occupied
more
or
less
the
same
physical
locality
unlike
the
rest
of
lod
who
tended
to
associate
by
phone
and
computer
atlanta
lod
actually
were
tightly
knit
it
was
no
real
surprise
that
the
secret
service
agents
apprehending
urvile
at
the
at
georgia
tech
would
discover
prophet
with
him
as
well
urvile
a
georgia
tech
student
in
polymer
chemistry
posed
quite
a
puzzling
case
for
law
enforcement
urvile
also
known
as
necron
as
well
as
other
handles
for
he
tended
to
change
his
about
once
a
month
was
both
an
accomplished
hacker
and
a
fanatic
simulation
games
are
an
unusual
hobby
but
then
hackers
are
unusual
people
and
their
favorite
pastimes
tend
to
be
somewhat
out
of
the
ordinary
the
american
simulation
game
is
probably
dungeons
dragons
a
parlor
entertainment
played
with
paper
maps
pencils
statistical
tables
and
a
variety
of
dice
players
pretend
to
be
heroic
characters
exploring
a
fantasy
world
the
fantasy
worlds
of
simulation
gaming
are
commonly
involving
swords
and
sorcery
wizards
knights
in
armor
unicorns
and
dragons
demons
and
goblins
urvile
and
his
fellow
gamers
preferred
their
fantasies
highly
technological
they
made
use
of
a
game
known
as
the
generic
universal
role
playing
system
published
by
a
company
called
steve
jackson
games
sjg
served
as
a
framework
for
creating
a
wide
variety
of
artificial
fantasy
worlds
steve
jackson
games
published
a
smorgasboard
of
books
full
of
detailed
information
and
gaming
hints
which
were
used
to
many
different
fantastic
backgrounds
for
the
basic
gurps
framework
urvile
made
extensive
use
of
two
sjg
books
called
gurps
and
gurps
special
ops
in
the
artificial
of
gurps
special
ops
players
entered
a
modern
fantasy
of
intrigue
and
international
espionage
on
beginning
the
game
players
started
small
and
powerless
perhaps
as
cia
agents
or
arms
dealers
but
as
players
persisted
through
a
series
of
game
sessions
game
sessions
generally
lasted
for
hours
over
long
elaborate
campaigns
that
might
be
pursued
for
months
on
end
then
they
would
achieve
new
skills
new
knowledge
new
power
they
would
acquire
and
hone
new
abilities
such
as
marksmanship
karate
wiretapping
or
watergate
burglary
they
could
also
win
various
kinds
of
imaginary
booty
like
berettas
or
martini
shakers
or
fast
cars
with
ejection
seats
and
under
the
headlights
as
might
be
imagined
from
the
complexity
of
these
games
urvile
gaming
notes
were
very
detailed
and
extensive
urvile
was
a
inventing
scenarios
for
his
fellow
gamers
giant
simulated
for
his
friends
to
unravel
urvile
game
notes
covered
dozens
of
pages
with
all
sorts
of
exotic
lunacy
all
about
ninja
raids
on
libya
and
on
encrypted
red
chinese
supercomputers
his
notes
were
written
on
and
kept
in
binders
the
handiest
scrap
paper
around
urvile
college
digs
were
the
many
pounds
of
bellsouth
printouts
and
documents
that
he
had
snitched
out
of
telco
dumpsters
his
notes
were
written
on
the
back
of
misappropriated
telco
property
worse
yet
the
gaming
notes
were
chaotically
interspersed
with
records
involving
actual
computer
intrusions
that
he
had
committed
not
only
was
it
next
to
impossible
to
tell
urvile
fantasy
from
cyberspace
reality
but
urvile
himself
barely
made
this
distinction
it
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
to
urvile
it
was
all
a
game
urvile
was
very
bright
highly
imaginative
and
quite
careless
of
other
people
notions
of
propriety
his
connection
to
reality
was
not
something
to
which
he
paid
a
great
deal
of
attention
hacking
was
a
game
for
urvile
it
was
an
amusement
he
was
carrying
out
it
was
something
he
was
doing
for
fun
and
urvile
was
an
obsessive
young
man
he
could
no
more
stop
hacking
than
he
could
stop
in
the
middle
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
or
stop
in
the
middle
of
reading
a
stephen
donaldson
fantasy
trilogy
the
name
urvile
came
from
a
donaldson
novel
urvile
airy
bulletproof
attitude
seriously
annoyed
his
interrogators
first
of
all
he
did
consider
that
he
done
anything
wrong
there
was
scarcely
a
shred
of
honest
remorse
in
him
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
privately
convinced
that
his
police
interrogators
were
operating
in
a
demented
all
their
own
urvile
was
too
polite
and
to
say
this
but
his
reactions
were
askew
and
disquieting
for
instance
there
was
the
business
about
lod
ability
to
monitor
to
the
police
and
secret
service
urvile
agreed
that
this
was
quite
possible
and
posed
no
big
problem
for
lod
in
fact
he
and
his
friends
had
kicked
the
idea
around
on
the
black
ice
board
much
as
they
had
discussed
many
other
nifty
notions
such
as
building
personal
and
fistfulls
of
they
had
hundreds
of
numbers
for
government
agencies
that
they
gotten
through
scanning
atlanta
phones
or
had
pulled
from
raided
mainframe
computers
basically
they
never
gotten
around
to
listening
in
on
the
cops
because
the
idea
was
interesting
enough
to
bother
with
besides
if
they
been
monitoring
secret
service
phone
calls
obviously
they
never
have
been
caught
in
the
first
place
right
the
secret
service
was
less
than
satisfied
with
this
hacker
logic
then
there
was
the
issue
of
crashing
the
phone
system
no
problem
urvile
admitted
sunnily
atlanta
lod
could
have
shut
down
phone
service
all
over
atlanta
any
time
they
liked
even
the
service
nothing
special
about
that
urvile
explained
patiently
bring
the
switch
to
its
knees
with
say
the
unix
makedir
bug
and
goes
down
too
as
a
matter
of
course
the
system
was
very
interesting
frankly
it
might
be
tremendously
interesting
to
cops
for
odd
reasons
of
their
own
but
as
technical
challenges
went
the
service
was
yawnsville
so
of
course
the
atlanta
three
could
crash
service
they
probably
could
have
crashed
service
all
over
bellsouth
territory
if
they
worked
at
it
for
a
while
but
atlanta
lod
were
crashers
only
losers
and
rodents
were
crashers
lod
were
elite
urvile
was
privately
convinced
that
sheer
technical
expertise
could
win
him
free
of
any
kind
of
problem
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
elite
status
in
the
digital
underground
had
placed
him
permanently
beyond
the
intellectual
grasp
of
cops
and
straights
urvile
had
a
lot
to
learn
of
the
three
lod
stalwarts
prophet
was
in
the
most
direct
trouble
prophet
was
a
unix
programming
expert
who
burrowed
in
and
out
of
the
internet
as
a
matter
of
course
he
started
his
hacking
career
at
around
age
meddling
with
a
unix
mainframe
system
at
the
university
of
north
carolina
prophet
himself
had
written
the
handy
legion
of
doom
file
unix
use
and
security
from
the
ground
up
unix
pronounced
is
a
powerful
flexible
computer
for
computers
in
when
unix
was
created
in
bell
labs
such
computers
were
exclusive
to
large
corporations
and
universities
but
today
unix
is
run
on
thousands
of
powerful
home
machines
unix
was
particularly
to
telecommunications
programming
and
had
become
a
standard
in
the
field
naturally
unix
also
became
a
standard
for
the
elite
hacker
and
phone
phreak
lately
prophet
had
not
been
so
active
as
leftist
and
urvile
but
prophet
was
a
recidivist
in
when
he
was
eighteen
prophet
had
been
convicted
of
unauthorized
access
to
a
computer
network
in
north
carolina
he
been
discovered
breaking
into
the
southern
bell
data
network
a
internal
telco
network
supposedly
closed
to
the
public
he
gotten
a
typical
hacker
sentence
six
months
suspended
hours
community
service
and
three
years
probation
after
that
humiliating
bust
prophet
had
gotten
rid
of
most
of
his
tonnage
of
illicit
phreak
and
hacker
data
and
had
tried
to
go
straight
he
was
after
all
still
on
probation
but
by
the
autumn
of
the
temptations
of
cyberspace
had
proved
too
much
for
young
prophet
and
he
was
with
urvile
and
leftist
into
some
of
the
hairiest
systems
around
in
early
september
he
broken
into
bellsouth
centralized
automation
system
aimsx
or
advanced
information
management
system
aimsx
was
an
internal
business
network
for
bellsouth
where
telco
employees
stored
electronic
mail
databases
memos
and
calendars
and
did
text
processing
since
aimsx
did
not
have
public
it
was
considered
utterly
invisible
to
the
public
and
was
not
it
did
even
require
passwords
prophet
abused
an
account
known
as
the
personal
account
of
an
unsuspecting
telco
employee
disguised
as
the
owner
of
prophet
made
about
ten
visits
to
aimsx
prophet
did
not
damage
or
delete
anything
in
the
system
his
presence
in
aimsx
was
harmless
and
almost
invisible
but
he
could
not
rest
content
with
that
one
particular
piece
of
processed
text
on
aimsx
was
a
telco
document
known
as
bell
south
standard
practice
control
office
administration
of
enhanced
services
for
special
services
and
major
account
centers
dated
march
prophet
had
not
been
looking
for
this
document
it
was
merely
one
among
hundreds
of
similar
documents
with
impenetrable
titles
however
having
blundered
over
it
in
the
course
of
his
illicit
wanderings
through
aimsx
he
decided
to
take
it
with
him
as
a
trophy
it
might
prove
very
useful
in
some
future
boasting
bragging
and
strutting
session
so
some
time
in
september
prophet
ordered
the
aimsx
mainframe
computer
to
copy
this
document
henceforth
called
simply
called
the
document
and
to
transfer
this
copy
to
his
home
computer
no
one
noticed
that
prophet
had
done
this
he
had
stolen
the
document
in
some
sense
but
notions
of
property
in
cyberspace
can
be
tricky
bellsouth
noticed
nothing
wrong
because
bellsouth
still
had
their
original
copy
they
had
not
been
robbed
of
the
document
itself
many
people
were
supposed
to
copy
this
document
specifically
people
who
worked
for
the
nineteen
bellsouth
special
services
and
major
account
centers
scattered
throughout
the
southeastern
united
states
that
was
what
it
was
for
why
it
was
present
on
a
computer
network
in
the
first
place
so
that
it
could
be
copied
and
read
by
telco
employees
but
now
the
data
had
been
copied
by
someone
who
was
supposed
to
look
at
it
prophet
now
had
his
trophy
but
he
further
decided
to
store
yet
another
copy
of
the
document
on
another
person
computer
this
unwitting
person
was
a
computer
enthusiast
named
richard
andrews
who
lived
near
joliet
illinois
richard
andrews
was
a
unix
programmer
by
trade
and
ran
a
powerful
unix
board
called
jolnet
in
the
basement
of
his
house
prophet
using
the
handle
robert
johnson
had
obtained
an
account
on
richard
andrews
computer
and
there
he
stashed
the
document
by
storing
it
in
his
own
private
section
of
andrews
computer
why
did
prophet
do
this
if
prophet
had
eliminated
the
document
from
his
own
computer
and
kept
it
hundreds
of
miles
away
on
another
machine
under
an
alias
then
he
might
have
been
fairly
safe
from
discovery
and
prosecution
although
his
sneaky
action
had
certainly
put
the
unsuspecting
richard
andrews
at
risk
but
like
most
hackers
prophet
was
a
for
illicit
data
when
it
came
to
the
crunch
he
could
not
bear
to
part
from
his
trophy
when
prophet
place
in
decatur
georgia
was
raided
in
july
there
was
the
document
a
smoking
gun
and
there
was
prophet
in
the
hands
of
the
secret
service
doing
his
best
to
explain
our
story
now
takes
us
away
from
the
atlanta
three
and
their
raids
of
the
summer
of
we
must
leave
atlanta
three
cooperating
fully
with
their
numerous
investigators
and
all
three
of
them
did
cooperate
as
their
sentencing
memorandum
from
the
us
district
court
of
the
northern
division
of
georgia
explained
just
before
all
three
of
them
were
sentenced
to
various
federal
prisons
in
november
we
must
now
catch
up
on
the
other
aspects
of
the
war
on
the
legion
of
doom
the
war
on
the
legion
was
a
war
on
a
network
in
fact
a
network
of
three
networks
which
intertwined
and
interrelated
in
a
complex
fashion
the
legion
itself
with
atlanta
lod
and
their
fry
guy
were
the
first
network
the
second
network
was
phrack
magazine
with
its
editors
and
contributors
the
third
network
involved
the
electronic
circle
around
a
hacker
known
as
terminus
the
war
against
these
hacker
networks
was
carried
out
by
a
law
enforcement
network
atlanta
lod
and
fry
guy
were
pursued
by
usss
agents
and
federal
prosecutors
in
atlanta
indiana
and
chicago
terminus
found
himself
pursued
by
usss
and
federal
prosecutors
from
baltimore
and
chicago
and
the
war
against
phrack
was
almost
entirely
a
chicago
operation
the
investigation
of
terminus
involved
a
great
deal
of
energy
mostly
from
the
chicago
task
force
but
it
was
to
be
the
and
of
the
crackdown
operations
terminus
who
lived
in
maryland
was
a
unix
programmer
and
consultant
fairly
under
his
given
name
in
the
unix
community
as
an
acknowledged
expert
on
at
t
minicomputers
terminus
idolized
at
t
especially
bellcore
and
longed
for
public
recognition
as
a
unix
expert
his
highest
ambition
was
to
work
for
bell
labs
but
terminus
had
odd
friends
and
a
spotted
history
terminus
had
once
been
the
subject
of
an
admiring
interview
in
phrack
volume
ii
issue
phile
dated
may
in
this
article
phrack
taran
king
described
terminus
as
an
electronics
engineer
born
in
at
years
old
quite
mature
for
a
hacker
terminus
had
once
been
sysop
of
a
underground
board
called
metronet
which
ran
on
an
apple
ii
later
he
replaced
metronet
with
an
underground
board
called
meganet
specializing
in
ibms
in
his
younger
days
terminus
had
written
one
of
the
very
first
and
most
elegant
programs
for
the
this
program
had
been
widely
distributed
in
the
underground
uncounted
legions
of
phreaks
and
hackers
had
used
terminus
scanner
program
to
telco
codes
this
feat
had
not
escaped
the
attention
of
telco
security
it
hardly
could
since
terminus
earlier
handle
terminal
technician
was
proudly
written
right
on
the
program
when
he
became
a
computer
professional
specializing
in
telecommunications
programming
he
adopted
the
handle
terminus
meant
to
indicate
that
he
had
reached
the
final
point
of
being
a
proficient
hacker
he
moved
up
to
the
netsys
board
on
an
at
t
computer
with
four
phone
lines
and
an
impressive
megs
of
storage
netsys
carried
complete
issues
of
phrack
and
terminus
was
quite
friendly
with
its
publishers
taran
king
and
knight
lightning
in
the
early
terminus
had
been
a
regular
on
plovernet
sherwood
forest
and
shadowland
all
pirate
boards
all
heavily
frequented
by
the
legion
of
doom
as
it
happened
terminus
was
never
officially
in
lod
because
he
never
been
given
the
official
lod
and
by
legion
maven
lex
luthor
terminus
had
never
physically
met
anyone
from
lod
but
that
scarcely
mattered
much
the
atlanta
three
themselves
had
never
been
officially
vetted
by
lex
either
as
far
as
law
enforcement
was
concerned
the
issues
were
clear
terminus
was
a
adult
computer
professional
with
particular
skills
at
at
t
software
and
hardware
but
terminus
reeked
of
the
legion
of
doom
and
the
underground
on
february
half
a
month
after
the
martin
luther
king

usss

tim
foley
from
chicago
and
jack
lewis
from
the
baltimore
office
accompanied
by
at
t
security
officer
jerry
dalton
travelled
to
middle
town
maryland
there
they
grilled
terminus
in
his
home
to
the
stark
terror
of
his
wife
and
small
children
and
in
their
customary
fashion
hauled
his
computers
out
the
door
the
netsys
machine
proved
to
contain
a
plethora
of
arcane
unix
software
proprietary

of

terminus
had
been
trading
this
software
with
a
small
circle
of
fellow
unix
programmers
very
unwisely
he
had
stored
seven
years
of
his
electronic
mail
on
his
netsys
machine
which
documented
all
the
friendly
arrangements
he
had
made
with

terminus
had
not
crashed

on

however
blithely
running

at

nevertheless
invented
the
unix
operating
system
and
somehow
at
t
managed
to
make
unix
a
minor
source
of
income
weirdly
unix
was
not
sold
as
computer
software
but
actually
retailed
under
an
obscure
regulatory
exemption
allowing
sales
of
surplus
equipment
and
scrap
any
bolder
attempt
to
promote
or
retail
unix
would
have
aroused
angry
legal
opposition
from
computer
companies
instead
unix
was
licensed
to
universities
at
modest
rates
where
the
acids
of
academic
freedom
ate
away
steadily
at
at
proprietary
rights
come
the
breakup
at
t
recognized
that
unix
was
a
potential
by
now
large
chunks
of
unix
code
had
been
created
that
were
not
at

and
were
being
sold
by
others
an
entire
rival
operating

had
arisen
in
berkeley
california
one
of
the

great
founts
of

to
be
technically
superior
to

but
at
t
has
not
allowed
mere
technical
elegance
to
intrude
on
the
business
of
marketing
proprietary

made
its
own
code
deliberately
incompatible
with
other
folks

and
has
written

that

can
prove

copyrightable
even
if
that

happens
to
be
somewhat
awkward
kludgey

not
exactly
kept

in

but
it
kept
a
grip
on
its
scruff
with
some
success
by
the
rampant
explosive
standards
of
software
piracy
at
t
unix
source

is
heavily
copyrighted
unix
was
traditionally
run
only
on
mainframe
machines
owned
by

than
on

where

can
get
up

the

of

with
any

is
small
it
tiny
compared
to

of

prepared

like

but
by
the
underground
in
the
persons
of

and
his
friends
was
gnawing
at
at

unix
and
the
property
in
question
was
not
sold
for
twenty
bucks
over
the
counter
at
the
local
branch
of
babbage
or
egghead
this
was
massive
sophisticated
corporate
code
worth
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
it
must
be
recognized
at
this
point
that
terminus
purported
ring
of
unix
software
pirates
had
not
actually
made
any
money
from
their
suspected
crimes
the
dollar
figure
bandied
about
for
the
contents
of
computer
did
not
mean
that
terminus
was
in
actual
illicit
possession
of
three
hundred
thousand
of
at
t
dollars
terminus
was
shipping
software
back
and
forth
privately
person
to
person
for
free
he
was
not
making
a
commercial
business
of
piracy
he
asked
for
money
he
did
take

he
lived
quite
modestly
at

employees
as
well
as
freelance
unix
consultants
like
terminus
commonly
worked
with
proprietary
at

software
both
in
the
office
and
at
home
on
their
private
machines
at
t
rarely
sent
security
officers
out
to
comb
the
hard
disks
of
its
consultants
cheap
freelance
unix
contractors
were
quite
useful
to
at
t
they
did
have
health
insurance
or
retirement
programs
much
less
union
membership
in
the
communication
workers
of
america
they
were
humble
digital
drudges
wandering
with

and

through
the
great
technological
temple
of

when
the
secret
service
arrived
at
their
homes
it
seemed
they
were
eating
with
company
silverware
and
sleeping
on
company
sheets
outrageously
they
behaved
as
if
the
things
they
worked
with
every
day
belonged
to
them
and
these
were
no
mere
hacker
teenagers
with
their
hands
full
of
and
their
noses
pressed
to
the
corporate
windowpane
these
guys
were
unix
wizards
not
only
carrying
at
t
data
in
their
machines
and
their
heads
but
eagerly
networking
about
it
over
machines
that
were
far
more
powerful
than
anything
previously
imagined
in
private
hands
how
do
you
keep
people
disposable
yet
assure
their
awestruck
respect
for
your
property
it
was
a
dilemma
much
unix
code
was
available
for
free
much
proprietary
unix
code
had
been
extensively
perhaps
altered
so
much
that
it
became
an
entirely
new
product
or
perhaps
not
intellectual
property
rights
for
software
developers
were
and
are
extraordinarily
complex
and
confused
and
software
piracy
like
the
private
copying
of
videos
is
one
of
the
most
widely
practiced
crimes
in
the
world
today
the
usss
were
not
experts
in
unix
or
familiar
with
the
customs
of
its
use
the
united
states
secret
service
considered
as
a
body
did
not
have
one
single
person
in
it
who
could
program
in
a
unix
environment
no
not
even
one
the
secret
service
were
making
extensive
use
of
expert
help
but
the
experts
they
had
chosen
were
at
t
and
bellcore
security
officials
the
very
victims
of
the
purported
crimes
under
investigation
the
very
people
whose
interest
in
at
t
proprietary
software
was
most
pronounced
on
february
terminus
was
arrested
by
agent
lewis
eventually
terminus
would
be
sent
to
prison
for
his
illicit
use
of
a
piece
of
at
t
software
the
issue
of
pirated
at
t
software
would
bubble
along
in
the
background
during
the
war
on
the
legion
of
doom
some
of
terminus
acquaintances
including
people
in
illinois
texas
and
california
were
grilled
by
the
secret
service
in
connection
with
the
illicit
copying
of
software
except
for
terminus
however
none
were
charged
with
a
crime
none
of
them
shared
his
peculiar
prominence
in
the
hacker
underground
but
that
did
not
mean
that
these
people
would
or
could
stay
out
of
trouble
the
transferral
of
illicit
data
in
cyberspace
is
hazy
and
business
with
paradoxical
dangers
for
everyone
concerned
hackers
signal
carriers
board
owners
cops
prosecutors
even
random
sometimes
attempts
to
avert
trouble
or
punish
wrongdoing
bring
more
trouble
than
would
simple
ignorance
indifference
or
impropriety
terminus
netsys
board
was
not
a
bulletin
board
system
though
it
had
most
of
the
usual
functions
of
a
board
netsys
was
not
a
machine
but
part
of
the
uucp
cooperative
network
the
uucp
network
uses
a
set
of
unix
software
programs
called
copy
which
allows
unix
systems
to
throw
data
to
one
another
at
high
speed
through
the
public
telephone
network
uucp
is
a
radically
decentralized
network
of
unix
computers
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
these
unix
machines
some
are
small
but
many
are
powerful
and
also
link
to
other

uucp
has
certain
arcane
links
to
major
networks
such
as
janet
easynet
bitnet
junet
vnet
dasnet
peacenet
and
fidonet
as
well
as
the
gigantic
internet
the
internet
is
not
actually
a

itself
but
rather
an
internetwork
connections
standard
that
allows
several

a
skilled
user
of
terminus
unix
machine
could
send
and
receive
electronic
mail
from
almost
any
major
computer
network
in
the
world
netsys
was
not
called
a
board
per
se
but
rather
a
node
nodes
were
larger
faster
and
more
sophisticated
than
mere
boards
and
for
hackers
to
hang
out
on
nodes
was
quite
the
step
up
from
merely
hanging
out
on
local
boards
terminus
netsys
node
in
maryland
had
a
number
of
direct
links
to
other
similar
uucp
nodes
run
by
people
who
shared
his
interests
and
at
least
something
of
his
attitude
one
of
these
nodes
was
jolnet
owned
by
richard
andrews
who
like
terminus
was
an
independent
unix
consultant
jolnet
also
ran
unix
and
could
be
contacted
at
high
speed
by
mainframe
machines
from
all
over
the
world
jolnet
was
quite
a
sophisticated
piece
of
work
technically
speaking
but
it
was
still
run
by
an
individual
as
a
private
hobby
jolnet
was
mostly
used
by
other
unix
programmers
for
mail
storage
and
access
to
networks
jolnet
supplied
access
network
access
to
about
two
hundred
people
as
well
as
a
local
junior
college
among
its
various
features
and
services
jolnet
also
carried
phrack
magazine
for
reasons
of
his
own
richard
andrews
had
become
suspicious
of
a
new
user
called
robert
johnson
richard
andrews
took
it
upon
himself
to
have
a
look
at
what
robert
johnson
was
storing
in
jolnet
and
andrews
found
the
document
robert
johnson
was
the
prophet
from
the
legion
of
doom
and
the
document
was
illicitly
copied
data
from
raid
on
the
bellsouth
computers
the
document
a
particularly
illicit
piece
of
digital
property
was
about
to
resume
its
long
complex
and
disastrous
career
it
struck
andrews
as
fishy
that
someone
not
a
telephone
employee
should
have
a
document
referring
to
the
enhanced
system
besides
the
document
itself
bore
an
obvious
warning
warning
not
for
use
or
disclosure
outside
bellsouth
or
any
of
its
subsidiaries
except
under
written
agreement
these
standard
nondisclosure
tags
are
often
appended
to
all
sorts
of
corporate
material
telcos
as
a
species
are
particularly
notorious
for
stamping
most
everything
in
sight
as
not
for
use
or
disclosure
still
this
particular
piece
of
data
was
about
the
system
that
sounded
bad
to
rich
andrews
andrews
was
not
prepared
to
ignore
this
sort
of
trouble
he
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
pass
the
document
along
to
a
friend
and
acquaintance
on
the
unix
network
for
consultation
so
around
september
andrews
sent
yet
another
copy
of
the
document
electronically
to
an
at
t
employee
one
charles
boykin
who
ran
a
node
called
attctc
in
dallas
texas
attctc
was
the
property
of
at
t
and
was
run
from
at
customer
technology
center
in
dallas
hence
the
name
attctc
attctc
was
as
killer
the
name
of
the
machine
that
the
system
was
running
on
killer
was
a
hefty
powerful
at
t
model
a
unix
platform
with
meg
of
memory
and
a
gigabytes
of
storage
when
killer
had
first
arrived
in
texas
in
the
had
been
one
of
at
t
great
white
hopes
for
going
with
ibm
for
the
corporate
market
killer
had
been
shipped
to
the
customer
technology
center
in
the
dallas
infomart
essentially
a
mall
and
there
it
sat
a
demonstration
model
charles
boykin
a
veteran
at
t
hardware
and
digital
communications
expert
was
a
local
technical
backup
man
for
the
at
t
system
as
a
display
model
in
the
infomart
mall
killer
had
little
to
do
and
it
seemed
a
shame
to
waste
the
system
capacity
so
boykin
ingeniously
wrote
some
unix
software
for
killer
and
plugged
the
machine
in
to
the
local
phone
network
killer
debut
in
late
made
it
the
first
publicly
available
unix
site
in
the
state
of
texas
anyone
who
wanted
to
play
was
welcome
the
machine
immediately
attracted
an
electronic
community
it
joined
the
uucp
network
and
offered
network
links
to
over
eighty
other
computer
sites
all
of
which
became
dependent
on
killer
for
their
links
to
the
greater
world
of
cyberspace
and
it
was
just
for
the
big
guys
personal
computer
users
also
stored
freeware
programs
for
the
amiga
the
apple
the
ibm
and
the
macintosh
on
killer
vast
meg
archives
at
one
time
killer
had
the
largest
library
of
macintosh
software
in
texas
eventually
killer
attracted
about
users
all
busily
communicating
uploading
and
downloading
getting
mail
gossipping
and
linking
to
arcane
and
distant
networks
boykin
received
no
pay
for
running
killer
he
considered
it
good
publicity
for
the
at
t
system
whose
sales
were
somewhat
less
than
stellar
but
he
also
simply
enjoyed
the
vibrant
community
his
skill
had
created
he
gave
away
the
unix
software
he
had
written
free
of
charge
in
the
unix
programming
community
charlie
boykin
had
the
reputation
of
a
warm
kind
of
guy
in
a
group
of
texan
unix
professionals
voted
boykin
system
administrator
of
the
year
he
was
considered
a
fellow
you
could
trust
for
good
advice
in
september
without
warning
the
document
came
plunging
into
boykin
life
forwarded
by
richard
andrews
boykin
immediately
recognized
that
the
document
was
hot
property
he
was
not
a
man
and
knew
little
about
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
baby
bells
but
he
certainly
knew
what
the
system
was
and
he
was
angry
to
see
confidential
data
about
it
in
the
hands
of
a
nogoodnik
this
was
clearly
a
matter
for
telco
security
so
on
september
boykin
made
yet
another
copy
of
the
document
and
passed
this
one
along
to
a
professional
acquaintance
of
his
one
jerome
dalton
from
at
t
corporate
information
security
jerry
dalton
was
the
very
fellow
who
would
later
raid
terminus
house
from
at
t
security
division
the
document
went
to
bellcore
bellcore
or
bell
communications
research
had
once
been
the
central
laboratory
of
the
bell
system
bell
labs
employees
had
invented
the
unix
operating
system
now
bellcore
was
a
jointly
owned
company
that
acted
as
the
research
arm
for
all
seven
of
the
baby
bell
rbocs
bellcore
was
in
a
good
position
to
security
technology
and
consultation
for
the
rbocs
and
the
gentleman
in
charge
of
this
effort
was
henry
kluepfel
a
veteran
of
the
bell
system
who
had
worked
there
for
years
on
october
dalton
passed
the
document
to
henry
kluepfel
kluepfel
a
veteran
expert
witness
in
telecommunications
fraud
and
cases
had
certainly
seen
worse
trouble
than
this
he
recognized
the
document
for
what
it
was
a
trophy
from
a
hacker
however
whatever
harm
had
been
done
in
the
intrusion
was
presumably
old
news
at
this
point
there
seemed
little
to
be
done
kluepfel
made
a
careful
note
of
the
circumstances
and
shelved
the
problem
for
the
time
being
whole
months
passed
february
arrived
the
atlanta
three
were
living
it
up
in
bell
south
switches
and
had
not
yet
met
their
comeuppance
the
legion
was
thriving
so
was
phrack
magazine
a
good
six
months
had
passed
since
prophet
aimsx
prophet
as
hackers
will
grew
weary
of
sitting
on
his
laurels
knight
lightning
and
taran
king
the
editors
of
phrack
were
always
begging
prophet
for
material
they
could
publish
prophet
decided
that
the
heat
must
be
off
by
this
time
and
that
he
could
safely
brag
boast
and
strut
so
he
sent
a
copy
of
the
document
yet
another
one
from
rich
andrews
jolnet
machine
to
knight
bitnet
account
at
the
university
of
missouri
let
review
the
fate
of
the
document
so
far
the
original
document
this
in
the
aimsx
system
on
a
mainframe
computer
in
atlanta
available
to
hundreds
of
people
but
all
of
them
presumably
bellsouth
employees
an
unknown
number
of
them
may
have
their
own
copies
of
this
document
but
they
are
all
professionals
and
all
trusted
by
the
phone
company
prophet
illicit
copy
at
home
on
his
own
computer
in
decatur
georgia
prophet
copy
stored
on
rich
andrew
jolnet
machine
in
the
basement
of
rich
andrews
house
near
joliet
illinois
charles
boykin
copy
on
killer
in
dallas
texas
sent
by
rich
andrews
from
joliet
jerry
dalton
copy
at
at
t
corporate
information
security
in
new
jersey
sent
from
charles
boykin
in
dallas
henry
kluepfel
copy
at
bellcore
security
headquarters
in
new
jersey
sent
by
dalton
knight
lightning
copy
sent
by
prophet
from
rich
andrews
machine
and
now
in
columbia
missouri
we
can
see
that
the
security
situation
of
this
proprietary
document
once
dug
out
of
aimsx
swiftly
became
bizarre
without
any
money
changing
hands
without
any
particular
special
effort
this
data
had
been
reproduced
at
least
six
times
and
had
spread
itself
all
over
the
continent
by
far
the
worst
however
was
yet
to
come
in
february
prophet
and
knight
lightning
bargained
electronically
over
the
fate
of
this
trophy
prophet
wanted
to
boast
but
at
the
same
time
scarcely
wanted
to
be
caught
for
his
part
knight
lightning
was
eager
to
publish
as
much
of
the
document
as
he
could
manage
knight
lightning
was
a
fledgling
major
with
a
particular
interest
in
issues
he
would
gladly
publish
most
anything
that
would
reflect
glory
on
the
prowess
of
the
underground
and
embarrass
the
telcos
however
knight
lightning
himself
had
contacts
in
telco
security
and
sometimes
consulted
them
on
material
he
received
that
might
be
too
dicey
for
publication
prophet
and
knight
lightning
decided
to
edit
the
document
so
as
to
delete
most
of
its
identifying
traits
first
of
all
its
large
not
for
use
or
disclosure
warning
had
to
go
then
there
were
other
matters
for
instance
it
listed
the
office
telephone
numbers
of
several
bellsouth
specialists
in
florida
if
these
phone
numbers
were
published
in
phrack
the
bellsouth
employees
involved
would
very
likely
be
hassled
by
phone
phreaks
which
would
anger
bellsouth
no
end
and
pose
a
definite
operational
hazard
for
both
prophet
and
phrack
so
knight
lightning
cut
the
document
almost
in
half
removing
the
phone
numbers
and
some
of
the
touchier
and
more
specific
information
he
passed
it
back
electronically
to
prophet
prophet
was
still
nervous
so
knight
lightning
cut
a
bit
more
they
finally
agreed
that
it
was
ready
to
go
and
that
it
would
be
published
in
phrack
under
the
pseudonym
the
eavesdropper
and
this
was
done
on
february
the
issue
of
phrack
featured
a
chatty
interview
with
chanda
leir
three
articles
on
bitnet
and
its
links
to
other
computer
networks
an
article
on
and
numbers
by
unknown
user
vaxcat
article
on
telco
basics
slyly
entitled
lifting
ma
bell
veil
of
secrecy
and
the
usual
phrack
world
news
the
news
section
with
painful
irony
featured
an
extended
account
of
the
sentencing
of
shadowhawk
an
chicago
hacker
who
had
just
been
put
in
federal
prison
by
william
cook
himself
and
then
there
were
the
two
articles
by
the
eavesdropper
the
first
was
the
edited
document
now
titled
control
office
administration
of
enhanced
services
for
special
services
and
major
account
centers
eavesdropper
second
article
was
a
glossary
of
terms
explaining
the
blizzard
of
telco
acronyms
and
buzzwords
in
the
document
the
hapless
document
was
now
distributed
in
the
usual
phrack
routine
to
a
good
one
hundred
and
fifty
sites
not
a
hundred
and
fifty
people
mind
you
a
hundred
and
fifty
sites
some
of
these
sites
linked
to
unix
nodes
or
bulletin
board
systems
which
themselves
had
readerships
of
tens
dozens
even
hundreds
of
people
this
was
february
nothing
happened
immediately
summer
came
and
the
atlanta
crew
were
raided
by
the
secret
service
fry
guy
was
apprehended
still
nothing
whatever
happened
to
phrack
six
more
issues
of
phrack
came
out
in
all
more
or
less
on
a
monthly
schedule
knight
lightning
and
taran
king
went
untouched
phrack
tended
to
duck
and
cover
whenever
the
heat
came
down
during
the
summer
busts
of
hacker
busts
tended
to
cluster
in
summer
perhaps
because
hackers
were
easier
to
find
at
home
than
in
college
phrack
had
ceased
publication
for
several
months
and
laid
low
several
lod
had
been
arrested
but
nothing
had
happened
to
the
phrack
crew
the
premiere
gossips
of
the
underground
in
phrack
had
been
taken
over
by
a
new
editor
crimson
death
a
raucous
youngster
with
a
taste
for
anarchy
files
however
looked
like
a
bounty
year
for
the
underground
knight
lightning
and
his
taran
king
took
up
the
reins
again
and
phrack
flourished
throughout
atlanta
lod
went
down
hard
in
the
summer
of
but
phrack
rolled
merrily
on
prophet
document
seemed
unlikely
to
cause
phrack
any
trouble
by
january
it
had
been
available
in
phrack
for
almost
a
year
kluepfel
and
dalton
officers
of
bellcore
and
at
t
security
had
possessed
the
document
for
sixteen
months
in
fact
they
had
it
even
before
knight
lightning
himself
and
had
done
nothing
in
particular
to
stop
its
distribution
they
had
even
told
rich
andrews
or
charles
boykin
to
erase
the
copies
from
their
unix
nodes
jolnet
and
killer
but
then
came
the
monster
martin
luther
king
day
crash
of
january
a
flat
three
days
later
on
january
four
agents
showed
up
at
knight
lightning
fraternity
house
one
was
timothy
foley
the
second
barbara
golden
both
of
them
secret
service
agents
from
the
chicago
office
also
along
was
a
university
of
missouri
security
officer
and
reed
newlin
a
security
man
from
southwestern
bell
the
rboc
having
jurisdiction
over
missouri
foley
accused
knight
lightning
of
causing
the
nationwide
crash
of
the
phone
system
knight
lightning
was
aghast
at
this
allegation
on
the
face
of
it
the
suspicion
was
not
entirely
implausible
though
knight
lightning
knew
that
he
himself
had
done
it
plenty
of
hackers
had
bragged
that
they
could
crash
the
phone
system
however
shadowhawk
for
instance
the
chicago
hacker
whom
william
cook
had
recently
put
in
jail
had
several
times
boasted
on
boards
that
he
could
shut
down
at
t
public
switched
network
and
now
this
event
or
something
that
looked
just
like
it
had
actually
taken
place
the
crash
had
lit
a
fire
under
the
chicago
task
force
and
the
former
at
bellcore
and
at
t
were
now
ready
to
roll
the
consensus
among
telco
security
already
horrified
by
the
skill
of
the
bellsouth
intruders
was
that
the
digital
underground
was
out
of
hand
lod
and
phrack
must
go
and
in
publishing
prophet
document
phrack
had
provided
law
enforcement
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
powerful
legal
weapon
foley
confronted
knight
lightning
about
the
document
knight
lightning
was
cowed
he
immediately
began
cooperating
fully
in
the
usual
tradition
of
the
digital
underground
he
gave
foley
a
complete
run
of
phrack
printed
out
in
a
set
of
binders
he
handed
over
his
electronic
mailing
list
of
phrack
subscribers
knight
lightning
was
grilled
for
four
hours
by
foley
and
his
cohorts
knight
lightning
admitted
that
prophet
had
passed
him
the
document
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
known
it
was
stolen
booty
from
a
hacker
raid
on
a
telephone
company
knight
lightning
signed
a
statement
to
this
effect
and
agreed
in
writing
to
cooperate
with
investigators
next
day
january
a
friday
the
secret
service
returned
with
a
search
warrant
and
thoroughly
searched
knight
upstairs
room
in
the
fraternity
house
they
took
all
his
floppy
disks
though
interestingly
they
left
knight
lightning
in
possession
of
both
his
computer
and
his
modem
the
computer
had
no
hard
disk
and
in
foley
judgement
was
not
a
store
of
evidence
but
this
was
a
very
minor
bright
spot
among
knight
lightning
rapidly
multiplying
troubles
by
this
time
knight
lightning
was
in
plenty
of
hot
water
not
only
with
federal
police
prosecutors
telco
investigators
and
university
security
but
with
the
elders
of
his
own
campus
fraternity
who
were
outraged
to
think
that
they
had
been
unwittingly
harboring
a
federal
on
monday
knight
lightning
was
summoned
to
chicago
where
he
was
further
grilled
by
foley
and
usss
veteran
agent
barbara
golden
this
time
with
an
attorney
present
and
on
tuesday
he
was
formally
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
the
trial
of
knight
lightning
which
occurred
on
july
was
the
crucial
of
the
hacker
crackdown
we
will
examine
the
trial
at
some
length
in
part
four
of
this
book
in
the
meantime
we
must
continue
our
dogged
pursuit
of
the
document
it
must
have
been
clear
by
january
that
the
document
in
the
form
phrack
had
published
it
back
in
february
had
gone
off
at
the
speed
of
light
in
at
least
a
hundred
and
fifty
different
directions
to
attempt
to
put
this
electronic
genie
back
in
the
bottle
was
flatly
impossible
and
yet
the
document
was
still
stolen
property
formally
and
legally
speaking
any
electronic
transference
of
this
document
by
anyone
unauthorized
to
have
it
could
be
interpreted
as
an
act
of
wire
fraud
interstate
transfer
of
stolen
property
including
electronic
property
was
a
federal
crime
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
had
been
assured
that
the
document
was
worth
a
hefty
sum
of
money
in
fact
they
had
a
precise
estimate
of
its
worth
from
bellsouth
security
personnel
a
sum
of
this
scale
seemed
to
warrant
vigorous
prosecution
even
if
the
damage
could
not
be
undone
at
least
this
large
sum
offered
a
good
legal
pretext
for
stern
punishment
of
the
thieves
it
seemed
likely
to
impress
judges
and
juries
and
it
could
be
used
in
court
to
mop
up
the
legion
of
doom
the
atlanta
crowd
was
already
in
the
bag
by
the
time
the
chicago
task
force
had
gotten
around
to
phrack
but
the
legion
was
a
thing
in
late
a
legion
of
doom
board
phoenix
project
had
gone
up
in
austin
texas
phoenix
project
was
sysoped
by
no
less
a
man
than
the
mentor
himself
ably
assisted
by
university
of
texas
student
and
hardened
doomster
erik
bloodaxe
as
we
have
seen
from
his
phrack
manifesto
the
mentor
was
a
hacker
zealot
who
regarded
computer
intrusion
as
something
close
to
a
moral
duty
phoenix
project
was
an
ambitious
effort
intended
to
revive
the
digital
underground
to
what
mentor
considered
the
full
flower
of
the
early
the
phoenix
board
would
also
boldly
bring
elite
hackers
with
the
telco
opposition
on
phoenix
america
cleverest
hackers
would
supposedly
shame
the
telco
squareheads
out
of
their
attitudes
and
perhaps
convince
them
that
the
legion
of
doom
elite
were
really
an
crew
the
premiere
of
phoenix
project
was
heavily
trumpeted
by
phrack
and
phoenix
project
carried
a
complete
run
of
phrack
issues
including
the
document
as
phrack
had
published
it
phoenix
project
was
only
one
of
many
possibly
hundreds
of
nodes
and
boards
all
over
america
that
were
in
guilty
possession
of
the
document
but
phoenix
was
an
outright
unashamed
legion
of
doom
board
under
mentor
guidance
it
was
flaunting
itself
in
the
face
of
telco
security
personnel
worse
yet
it
was
actively
trying
to
win
them
over
as
sympathizers
for
the
digital
underground
elite
phoenix
had
no
cards
or
codes
on
it
its
hacker
elite
considered
phoenix
at
least
technically
legal
but
phoenix
was
a
corrupting
influence
where
hacker
anarchy
was
eating
away
like
digital
acid
at
the
underbelly
of
corporate
propriety
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
now
prepared
to
descend
upon
austin
texas
oddly
not
one
but
two
trails
of
the
task
force
investigation
led
toward
austin
the
city
of
austin
like
atlanta
had
made
itself
a
bulwark
of
the
sunbelt
information
age
with
a
strong
university
research
presence
and
a
number
of
electronics
companies
including
motorola
dell
compuadd
ibm
sematech
and
mcc
where
computing
machinery
went
hackers
generally
followed
austin
boasted
not
only
phoenix
project
currently
most
flagrant
underground
board
but
a
number
of
unix
nodes
one
of
these
nodes
was
elephant
run
by
a
unix
consultant
named
robert
izenberg
izenberg
in
search
of
a
relaxed
southern
lifestyle
and
a
lowered
had
recently
migrated
to
austin
from
new
jersey
in
new
jersey
izenberg
had
worked
for
an
independent
contracting
company
programming
unix
code
for
at
t
itself
terminus
had
been
a
frequent
user
on
privately
owned
elephant
node
having
interviewed
terminus
and
examined
the
records
on
netsys
the
chicago
task
force
were
now
convinced
that
they
had
discovered
an
underground
gang
of
unix
software
pirates
who
were
demonstrably
guilty
of
interstate
trafficking
in
illicitly
copied
at
t
source
code
izenberg
was
swept
into
the
dragnet
around
terminus
the
ultimate
unix
hacker
izenberg
in
austin
had
settled
down
into
a
unix
job
with
a
texan
branch
of
ibm
izenberg
was
no
longer
working
as
a
contractor
for
at
t
but
he
had
friends
in
new
jersey
and
he
still
logged
on
to
at
t
unix
computers
back
in
new
jersey
more
or
less
whenever
it
pleased
him
izenberg
activities
appeared
highly
suspicious
to
the
task
force
izenberg
might
well
be
breaking
into
at
t
computers
swiping
at
t
software
and
passing
it
to
terminus
and
other
possible
confederates
through
the
unix
node
network
and
this
data
was
worth
not
merely
but
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
february
robert
izenberg
arrived
home
from
work
at
ibm
to
find
that
all
the
computers
had
mysteriously
vanished
from
his
austin
apartment
naturally
he
assumed
that
he
had
been
robbed
his
elephant
node
his
other
machines
his
notebooks
his
disks
his
tapes
all
gone
however
nothing
much
else
seemed
disturbed
the
place
had
not
been
ransacked
the
puzzle
becaming
much
stranger
some
five
minutes
later
austin
secret
service
agent
al
soliz
accompanied
by
university
of
texas
officer
larry
coutorie
and
the
ubiquitous
tim
foley
made
their
appearance
at
izenberg
door
they
were
in
plain
clothes
slacks
polo
shirts
they
came
in
and
tim
foley
accused
izenberg
of
belonging
to
the
legion
of
doom
izenberg
told
them
that
he
had
never
heard
of
the
legion
of
doom
and
what
about
a
certain
stolen
document
that
posed
a
direct
threat
to
the
police
emergency
lines
izenberg
claimed
that
never
heard
of
that
either
his
interrogators
found
this
difficult
to
believe
did
he
know
terminus
who
they
gave
him
terminus
real
name
oh
yes
said
izenberg
he
knew
that
guy
all
right
he
was
leading
discussions
on
the
internet
about
at
t
computers
especially
the
at
t
at
t
had
thrust
this
machine
into
the
marketplace
but
like
many
of
at
t
ambitious
attempts
to
enter
the
computing
arena
the
project
had
something
less
than
a
glittering
success
izenberg
himself
had
been
a
contractor
for
the
division
of
at
t
that
supported
the
the
entire
division
had
been
shut
down
nowadays
the
cheapest
and
quickest
way
to
get
help
with
this
fractious
piece
of
machinery
was
to
join
one
of
discussion
groups
on
the
internet
where
friendly
and
knowledgeable
hackers
would
help
you
for
free
naturally
the
remarks
within
this
group
were
less
than
flattering
about
the
death
star
that
the
problem
foley
told
izenberg
that
terminus
had
been
acquiring
hot
software
through
his
izenberg
machine
izenberg
shrugged
this
off
a
good
eight
megabytes
of
data
flowed
through
his
uucp
site
every
day
uucp
nodes
spewed
data
like
fire
hoses
elephant
had
been
directly
linked
to
netsys
not
surprising
since
terminus
was
a
expert
and
izenberg
had
been
a
contractor
izenberg
was
also
linked
to
attctc
and
the
university
of
texas
terminus
was
a
unix
expert
and
might
have
been
up
to
all
manner
of
hijinks
on
elephant
nothing
izenberg
could
do
about
that
that
was
physically
impossible
needle
in
a
haystack
in
a
grilling
foley
urged
izenberg
to
come
clean
and
admit
that
he
was
in
conspiracy
with
terminus
and
a
member
of
the
legion
of
doom
izenberg
denied
this
he
was
no
weirdo
teenage
hacker
he
was
years
old
and
did
even
have
a
handle
izenberg
was
a
former
tv
technician
and
electronics
specialist
who
had
drifted
into
unix
consulting
as
a
adult
izenberg
had
never
met
terminus
physically
he
once
bought
a
cheap
modem
from
him
though
foley
told
him
that
this
modem
a
telenet
which
ran
at
kilobaud
and
which
had
just
gone
out
izenberg
door
in
secret
service
custody
was
likely
hot
property
izenberg
was
taken
aback
to
hear
this
but
then
again
most
of
izenberg
equipment
like
that
of
most
freelance
professionals
in
the
industry
was
discounted
passed
through
various
kinds
of
barter
and
there
was
no
proof
that
the
modem
was
stolen
and
even
if
it
were
izenberg
hardly
saw
how
that
gave
them
the
right
to
take
every
electronic
item
in
his
house
still
if
the
united
states
secret
service
figured
they
needed
his
computer
for
national
security
reasons
or
whatever
then
izenberg
would
not
kick
he
figured
he
would
somehow
make
the
sacrifice
of
his
twenty
thousand
dollars
worth
of
professional
equipment
in
the
spirit
of
full
cooperation
and
good
citizenship
robert
izenberg
was
not
arrested
izenberg
was
not
charged
with
any
crime
his
uucp
node
full
of
some
megabytes
of
the
files
mail
and
data
of
himself
and
his
dozen
or
so
entirely
innocent
users
went
out
the
door
as
evidence
along
with
the
disks
and
tapes
izenberg
had
lost
about
megabytes
of
data
six
months
would
pass
before
izenberg
decided
to
phone
the
secret
service
and
ask
how
the
case
was
going
that
was
the
first
time
that
robert
izenberg
would
ever
hear
the
name
of
william
cook
as
of
january
a
full
two
years
after
the
seizure
izenberg
still
not
charged
with
any
crime
would
be
struggling
through
the
morass
of
the
courts
in
hope
of
recovering
his
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
seized
equipment
in
the
meantime
the
izenberg
case
received
absolutely
no
press
coverage
the
secret
service
had
walked
into
an
austin
home
removed
a
unix
board
system
and
met
with
no
operational
difficulties
whatsoever
except
that
word
of
a
crackdown
had
percolated
through
the
legion
of
doom
the
mentor
voluntarily
shut
down
the
phoenix
project
it
seemed
a
pity
especially
as
telco
security
employees
had
in
fact
shown
up
on
phoenix
just
as
he
had
hoped
along
with
the
usual
motley
crowd
of
lod
heavies
phreaks
hackers
and
wannabes
there
was
sandy
sandquist
from
us
sprint
security
and
some
guy
named
henry
kluepfel
from
bellcore
itself
kluepfel
had
been
trading
friendly
banter
with
hackers
on
phoenix
since
january
two
weeks
after
the
martin
luther
king
day
crash
the
presence
of
such
a
stellar
telco
official
seemed
quite
the
coup
for
phoenix
project
still
mentor
could
judge
the
climate
atlanta
in
ruins
phrack
in
deep
trouble
something
weird
going
on
with
unix
nodes
discretion
was
advisable
phoenix
project
went
kluepfel
of
course
had
been
monitoring
this
lod
bulletin
board
for
his
own
purposes
and
those
of
the
chicago
unit
as
far
back
as
june
kluepfel
had
logged
on
to
a
texas
underground
board
called
phreak
klass
there
discovered
an
chicago
youngster
named
shadowhawk
strutting
and
boasting
about
rifling
at
t
computer
files
and
bragging
of
his
ambitions
to
riddle
at
t
bellcore
computers
with
trojan
horse
programs
kluepfel
had
passed
the
news
to
cook
in
chicago
shadowhawk
computers
had
gone
out
the
door
in
secret
service
custody
and
shadowhawk
himself
had
gone
to
jail
now
it
was
phoenix
project
turn
phoenix
project
postured
about
legality
and
merely
intellectual
interest
but
it
reeked
of
the
underground
it
had
phrack
on
it
it
had
the
document
it
had
a
lot
of
dicey
talk
about
breaking
into
systems
including
some
bold
and
reckless
stuff
about
a
supposed
decryption
service
that
mentor
and
friends
were
planning
to
run
to
help
crack
encrypted
passwords
off
of
hacked
systems
mentor
was
an
adult
there
was
a
bulletin
board
at
his
place
of
work
as
well
kleupfel
logged
onto
this
board
too
and
discovered
it
to
be
called
illuminati
it
was
run
by
some
company
called
steve
jackson
games
on
march
the
austin
crackdown
went
into
high
gear
on
the
morning
of
march
a
thursday
university
of
texas
student
erik
bloodaxe
of
phoenix
project
and
an
avowed
member
of
the
legion
of
doom
was
wakened
by
a
police
revolver
levelled
at
his
head
bloodaxe
watched
jittery
as
secret
service
agents
appropriated
his
baud
terminal
and
rifling
his
files
discovered
his
treasured
for
robert
notorious
internet
worm
but
bloodaxe
a
wily
operator
had
suspected
that
something
of
the
like
might
be
coming
all
his
best
equipment
had
been
hidden
away
elsewhere
the
raiders
took
everything
electronic
however
including
his
telephone
they
were
stymied
by
his
hefty
game
and
left
it
in
place
as
it
was
simply
too
heavy
to
move
bloodaxe
was
not
arrested
he
was
not
charged
with
any
crime
a
good
two
years
later
the
police
still
had
what
they
had
taken
from
him
however
the
mentor
was
less
wary
the
dawn
raid
rousted
him
and
his
wife
from
bed
in
their
underwear
and
six
secret
service
agents
accompanied
by
an
austin
policeman
and
henry
kluepfel
himself
made
a
rich
haul
off
went
the
works
into

this
property
remained
in
police
custody
mentor
remained
under
guard
in
his
apartment
as
agents
prepared
to
raid
steve
jackson
games
the
fact
that
this
was
a
business
headquarters
and
not
a
private
residence
did
not
deter
the
agents
it
was
still
very
early
no
one
was
at
work
yet
the
agents
prepared
to
break
down
the
door
but
mentor
eavesdropping
on
the
secret

traffic
begged
them
not
to
do
it
and
offered
his
key
to
the
building
the
exact
details
of
the
next
events
are
unclear
the
agents
would
not
let
anyone
else
into
the
building
their
search
warrant
when
produced
was
unsigned
apparently
they
breakfasted
from
the
local
whataburger
as
the
litter
from

was
later
found
inside

also
extensively
sampled

by

someone
tore
a

sjg

diligently
showing
up

were
met
at

and
briefly
questioned
by

the

watched
in
astonishment
as

wielding
crowbars
and
screwdrivers
emerged
with
captive

they
attacked

several
hundred

two

three

various

and
oddly
a

the

deprived
sjg
of
all
the

and

the
loss
of
two
other
sjg

was
a
severe
blow
as
well
since
it
caused
the
loss
of
electronically
stored

financial

business
correspondence
and
not
least
the

no
one
at
steve

was
arrested
no
one
was
accused
of
any
crime
no
charges
were
filed
everything
appropriated
was
officially
kept
as
evidence
of
crimes
never
specified
after
the
phrack
the
steve
jackson
games
scandal
was
the
most
bizarre
and
aggravating
incident
of
the
hacker
crackdown
of
this
raid
by
the
chicago
task
force
on
a
gaming
publisher
was
to
rouse
a
swarming
host
of
civil
liberties
issues
and
gave
rise
to
an
enduring
controversy
that
was
still
itself
and
growing
in
the
scope
of
its
implications
a
full
two
years
later
the
pursuit
of
the
document
stopped
with
the
steve
jackson
games
raid
as
we
have
seen
there
were
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
computer
users
in
america
with
the
document
in
their
possession
theoretically
chicago
had
a
perfect
legal
right
to
raid
any
of
these
people
and
could
have
legally
seized
the
machines
of
anybody
who
subscribed
to
phrack
however
there
was
no
copy
of
the
document
on
jackson
illuminati
board
and
there
the
chicago
raiders
stopped
dead
they
have
not
raided
anyone
since
it
might
be
assumed
that
rich
andrews
and
charlie
boykin
who
had
brought
the
document
to
the
attention
of
telco
security
might
be
spared
any
official
suspicion
but
as
we
have
seen
the
willingness
to
cooperate
fully
offers
little
if
any
assurance
against
federal
prosecution
richard
andrews
found
himself
in
deep
trouble
thanks
to
the
document
andrews
lived
in
illinois
the
native
stomping
grounds
of
the
chicago
task
force
on
february
and
both
his
home
and
his
place
of
work
were
raided
by
usss
his
machines
went
out
the
door
too
and
he
was
grilled
at
length
though
not
arrested
andrews
proved
to
be
in
purportedly
guilty
possession
of
unix
svr
unix
svr
uucp
pmon
wwb
iwb
dwb
nroff
korn
shell
and
quest
among
other
items
andrews
had
received
this
proprietary
code
which
at
t
officially
valued
at
well
over
through
the
unix
network
much
of
it
supplied
to
him
as
a
personal
favor
by
terminus
perhaps
worse
yet
andrews
admitted
to
returning
the
favor
by
passing
terminus
a
copy
of
at
t
proprietary
starlan
source
code
even
charles
boykin
himself
an
at
t
employee
entered
some
very
hot
water
by
he
almost
forgotten
about
the
problem
he
reported
in
september
in
fact
since
that
date
he
passed
two
more
security
alerts
to
jerry
dalton
concerning
matters
that
boykin
considered
far
worse
than
the
document
but
by
year
of
the
crackdown
at
t
corporate
information
security
was
fed
up
with
killer
this
machine
offered
no
direct
income
to
at
t
and
was
providing
aid
and
comfort
to
a
cloud
of
suspicious
yokels
from
outside
the
company
some
of
them
actively
malicious
toward
at
t
its
property
and
its
corporate
interests
whatever
goodwill
and
publicity
had
been
won
among
killer
devoted
users
was
considered
no
longer
worth
the
security
risk
on
february
jerry
dalton
arrived
in
dallas
and
simply
unplugged
the
phone
jacks
to
the
puzzled
alarm
of
killer
many
texan
users
killer
went
permanently
with
the
loss
of
vast
archives
of
programs
and
huge
quantities
of
electronic
mail
it
was
never
restored
to
service
at
t
showed
no
particular
regard
for
the
property
of
these
people
whatever
property
the
users
had
been
storing
on
at
t
computer
simply
vanished
completely
boykin
who
had
himself
reported
the
problem
now
found
himself
under
a
cloud
of
suspicion
in
a
weird
replay
of
the
secret
service
seizures
boykin
own
home
was
visited
by
at
t
security
and
his
own
machines
were
carried
out
the
door
however
there
were
marked
special
features
in
the
boykin
case
boykin
disks
and
his
personal
computers
were
swiftly
examined
by
his
corporate
employers
and
returned
politely
in
just
two
days
unlike
secret
service
seizures
which
commonly
take
months
or
years
boykin
was
not
charged
with
any
crime
or
wrongdoing
and
he
kept
his
job
with
at
t
though
he
did
retire
from
at
t
in
september
at
the
age
of
it
interesting
to
note
that
the
us
secret
service
somehow
failed
to
seize
boykin
killer
node
and
carry
at
t
own
computer
out
the
door
nor
did
they
raid
boykin
home
they
seemed
perfectly
willing
to
take
the
word
of
at
t
security
that
at
t
employee
and
at
t
killer
node
were
free
of
hacker
contraband
and
on
the
it
digital
at
this
point
as
megabytes
of
texan
electronic
community
were
erased
in
and
killer
itself
was
shipped
out
of
the
state
but
the
experiences
of
andrews
and
boykin
and
the
users
of
their
systems
remained
side
issues
they
did
not
begin
to
assume
the
social
political
and
legal
importance
that
gathered
slowly
but
inexorably
around
the
issue
of
the
raid
on
steve
jackson
games
we
must
now
turn
our
attention
to
steve
jackson
games
itself
and
explain
what
sjg
was
what
it
really
did
and
how
it
had
managed
to
attract
this
particularly
odd
and
virulent
kind
of
trouble
the
reader
may
recall
that
this
is
not
the
first
but
the
second
time
that
the
company
has
appeared
in
this
narrative
a
steve
jackson
game
called
gurps
was
a
favorite
pastime
of
atlanta
hacker
urvile
and
urvile
gaming
notes
had
been
mixed
up
promiscuously
with
notes
about
his
actual
computer
intrusions
first
steve
jackson
games
was
not
a
publisher
of
computer
games
sjg
published
simulation
games
parlor
games
that
were
played
on
paper
with
pencils
and
dice
and
printed
guidebooks
full
of
rules
and
statistics
tables
there
were
no
computers
involved
in
the
games
themselves
when
you
bought
a
steve
jackson
game
you
did
not
receive
any
software
disks
what
you
got
was
a
plastic
bag
with
some
cardboard
game
tokens
maybe
a
few
maps
or
a
deck
of
cards
most
of
their
products
were
books
however
computers
were
deeply
involved
in
the
steve
jackson
games
business
like
almost
all
modern
publishers
steve
jackson
and
his
fifteen
employees
used
computers
to
write
text
to
keep
accounts
and
to
run
the
business
generally
they
also
used
a
computer
to
run
their
official
bulletin
board
system
for
steve
jackson
games
a
board
called
illuminati
on
illuminati
simulation
gamers
who
happened
to
own
computers
and
modems
could
associate
trade
mail
debate
the
theory
and
practice
of
gaming
and
keep
up
with
the
company
news
and
its
product
announcements
illuminati
was
a
modestly
popular
board
run
on
a
small
computer
with
limited
storage
only
one
and
no
ties
to
computer
networks
it
did
however
have
hundreds
of
users
many
of
them
dedicated
gamers
willing
to
call
from
illuminati
was
not
an
underground
board
it
did
not
feature
hints
on
computer
intrusion
or
anarchy
files
or
illicitly
posted
credit
card
numbers
or
access
codes
some
of
illuminati
users
however
were
members
of
the
legion
of
doom
and
so
was
one
of
steve
jackson
senior
employees
the
mentor
the
mentor
wrote
for
phrack
and
also
ran
an
underground
board
phoenix
project
but
the
mentor
was
not
a
computer
professional
the
mentor
was
the
managing
editor
of
steve
jackson
games
and
a
professional
game
designer
by
trade
these
lod
members
did
not
use
illuminati
to
help
their
hacking
activities
they
used
it
to
help
their
activities
and
they
were
even
more
dedicated
to
simulation
gaming
than
they
were
to
hacking
illuminati
got
its
name
from
a
that
steve
jackson
himself
the
company
founder
and
sole
owner
had
invented
this
was
one
of
mr
jackson
most
successful
most
technically
innovative
products
illuminati
was
a
game
of
paranoiac
conspiracy
in
which
various
antisocial
cults
warred
covertly
to
dominate
the
world
illuminati
was
hilarious
and
great
fun
to
play
involving
flying
saucers
the
cia
the
kgb
the
phone
companies
the
ku
klux
klan
the
south
american
nazis
the
cocaine
cartels
the
boy
scouts
and
dozens
of
other
splinter
groups
from
the
twisted
depths
of
jackson
professionally
fervid
imagination
for
the
uninitiated
any
public
discussion
of
the
illuminati
sounded
by
turns
utterly
menacing
or
completely
insane
and
then
there
was
sjg
car
wars
in
which
armored
with
and
heavy
did
battle
on
the
american
highways
of
the
future
the
lively
car
wars
discussion
on
the
illuminati
board
featured
many
meticulous
painstaking
discussions
of
the
effects
of
grenades
flamethrowers
and
napalm
it
sounded
like
hacker
anarchy
files
run
amuck
mr
jackson
and
his
earned
their
daily
bread
by
supplying
people
with
adventures
and
weird
ideas
the
more
the
better
simulation
gaming
is
an
unusual
pastime
but
gamers
have
not
generally
had
to
beg
the
permission
of
the
secret
service
to
exist
wargames
and
adventures
are
an
old
and
honored
pastime
much
favored
by
professional
military
strategists
once
these
games
are
now
played
by
hundreds
of
thousands
of
enthusiasts
throughout

steve
jackson
games
of
austin
texas
was
a
games
company
of
the
middle
rank
in
sjg
grossed
about
a
million
dollars
jackson
himself
had
a
good
reputation
in
his
industry
as
a
talented
and
innovative
designer
of
rather
unconventional
games
but
his
company
was
something
less
than
a
titan
of
the
field
certainly
not
like
the
tsr
or
britain
gigantic
games
workshop
sjg
austin
headquarters
was
a
modest
brick
cluttered
with
phones
photocopiers
fax
machines
and
computers
it
bustled
with
activity
and
was
littered
with
glossy
promotional
brochures
and
novels
attached
to
the
offices
was
a
large
warehouse
piled
twenty
feet
high
with
cardboard
boxes
of
games
and
books
despite
the
weird
imaginings
that
went
on
within
it
the
sjg
headquarters
was
quite
a
quotidian
everyday
sort
of
place
it
looked
like
what
it
was
a
publishers
digs
both
car
wars
and
illuminati
were
popular
games
but
the
mainstay
of
the
jackson
organization
was
their
generic
universal
system
the
gurps
system
was
considered
solid
and
an
asset
for
players
but
perhaps
the
most
popular
feature
of
the
gurps
system
was
that
it
allowed
to
design
scenarios
that
closely
resembled
books
movies
and
other
works
of
fantasy
jackson
had
licensed
and
adapted
works
from
many
science
fiction
and
fantasy
authors
there
was
gurps
conan
gurps
riverworld
gurps
horseclans
gurps
witch
world
names
eminently
familiar
to
readers
and
there
was
gurps
special
ops
from
the
world
of
espionage
fantasy
and
unconventional
warfare
and
then
there
was
gurps
cyberpunk
cyberpunk
was
a
term
given
to
certain
science
fiction
writers
who
had
entered
the
genre
in
the
cyberpunk
as
the
label
implies
had
two
general
distinguishing
features
first
its
writers
had
a
compelling
interest
in
information
technology
an
interest
closely
akin
to
science
fiction
earlier
fascination
with
space
travel
and
second
these
writers
were
punks
with
all
the
distinguishing
features
that
that
implies
bohemian
artiness
youth
run
wild
an
air
of
deliberate
rebellion
funny
clothes
and
hair
odd
politics
a
fondness
for
abrasive
rock
and
roll
in
a
word
trouble
the
cyberpunk
sf
writers
were
a
small
group
of
mostly
white
litterateurs
scattered
through
the
us
and
canada
only
one
rudy
rucker
a
professor
of
computer
science
in
silicon
valley
could
rank
with
even
the
humblest
computer
hacker
but
except
for
professor
rucker
the
cyberpunk
authors
were
not
programmers
or
hardware
experts
they
considered
themselves
artists
as
indeed
did
professor
rucker
however
these
writers
all
owned
computers
and
took
an
intense
and
public
interest
in
the
social
ramifications
of
the
information
industry
the
cyberpunks
had
a
strong
following
among
the
global
generation
that
had
grown
up
in
a
world
of
computers
multinational
networks
and
cable
television
their
outlook
was
considered
somewhat
morbid
cynical
and
dark
but
then
again
so
was
the
outlook
of
their
generational
peers
as
that
generation
matured
and
increased
in
strength
and
influence
so
did
the
cyberpunks
as
writers
went
they
were
doing
fairly
well
for
themselves
by
the
late
their
work
had
attracted
attention
from
gaming
companies
including
steve
jackson
games
which
was
planning
a
cyberpunk
simulation
for
the
flourishing
gurps
the
time
seemed
ripe
for
such
a
product
which
had
already
been
proven
in
the
marketplace
the
first
company
out
of
the
gate
with
a
product
boldly
called
cyberpunk
in
defiance
of
possible
suits
had
been
an
upstart
group
called
talsorian
talsorian
cyberpunk
was
a
fairly
decent
game
but
the
mechanics
of
the
simulation
system
left
a
lot
to
be
desired
commercially
however
the
game
did
very
well
the
next
cyberpunk
game
had
been
the
even
more
successful
shadowrun
by
fasa
corporation
the
mechanics
of
this
game
were
fine
but
the
scenario
was
rendered
moronic
by
sappy
fantasy
elements
like
elves
trolls
wizards
and
dragons
all
highly
according
to
the
standards
of
cyberpunk
science
fiction
other
game
designers
were
champing
at
the
bit
prominent
among
them
was
the
mentor
a
gentleman
who
like
most
of
his
friends
in
the
legion
of
doom
was
quite
the
cyberpunk
devotee
mentor
reasoned
that
the
time
had
come
for
a
real
cyberpunk
one
that
the
princes
of
in
the
legion
of
doom
could
play
without
laughing
themselves
sick
this
book
gurps
cyberpunk
would
reek
of
culturally
authenticity
mentor
was
particularly
for
this
task
naturally
he
knew
far
more
about
and
digital
skullduggery
than
any
previously
published
cyberpunk
author
not
only
that
but
he
was
good
at
his
work
a
vivid
imagination
combined
with
an
instinctive
feeling
for
the
working
of
systems
and
especially
the
loopholes
within
them
are
excellent
qualities
for
a
professional
game
designer
by
march
gurps
cyberpunk
was
almost
complete
ready
to
print
and
ship
steve
jackson
expected
vigorous
sales
for
this
item
which
he
hoped
would
keep
the
company
financially
afloat
for
several
months
gurps
cyberpunk
like
the
other
gurps
modules
was
not
a
game
like
a
monopoly
set
but
a
book
a
bound
paperback
book
the
size
of
a
glossy
magazine
with
a
slick
color
cover
and
pages
full
of
text
illustrations
tables
and
footnotes
it
was
advertised
as
a
game
and
was
used
as
an
aid
to
but
it
was
a
book
with
an
isbn
number
published
in
texas
copyrighted
and
sold
in
bookstores
and
now
that
book
stored
on
a
computer
had
gone
out
the
door
in
the
custody
of
the
secret
service
the
day
after
the
raid
steve
jackson
visited
the
local
secret
service
headquarters
with
a
lawyer
in
tow
there
he
confronted
tim
foley
still
in
austin
at
that
time
and
demanded
his
book
back
but
there
was
trouble
gurps
cyberpunk
alleged
a
secret
service
agent
to
astonished
businessman
steve
jackson
was
a
manual
for
computer
crime
it
science
fiction
jackson
said
no
this
is
real
this
statement
was
repeated
several
times
by
several
agents
jackson
ominously
accurate
game
had
passed
from
pure
obscure
fantasy
into
the
impure
highly
publicized
fantasy
of
the
hacker
crackdown
no
mention
was
made
of
the
real
reason
for
the
search
according
to
their
search
warrant
the
raiders
had
expected
to
find
the
document
stored
on
jackson
bulletin
board
system
but
that
warrant
was
sealed
a
procedure
that
most
law
enforcement
agencies
will
use
only
when
lives
are
demonstrably
in
danger
the
true
motives
were
not
discovered
until
the
jackson
was
unsealed
by
his
lawyers
many
months
later
the
secret
service
and
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
said
absolutely
nothing
to
steve
jackson
about
any
threat
to
the
police
system
they
said
nothing
about
the
atlanta
three
nothing
about
phrack
or
knight
lightning
nothing
about
terminus
jackson
was
left
to
believe
that
his
computers
had
been
seized
because
he
intended
to
publish
a
science
fiction
book
that
law
enforcement
considered
too
dangerous
to
see
print
this
misconception
was
repeated
again
and
again
for
months
to
an
public
audience
it
was
not
the
truth
of
the
case
but
as
months
passed
and
this
misconception
was
publicly
printed
again
and
again
it
became
one
of
the
few
publicly
known
facts
about
the
mysterious
hacker
crackdown
the
secret
service
had
seized
a
computer
to
stop
the
publication
of
a
cyberpunk
science
fiction
book
the
second
section
of
this
book
the
digital
underground
is
almost
finished
now
we
have
become
acquainted
with
all
the
major
figures
of
this
case
who
actually
belong
to
the
underground
milieu
of
computer
intrusion
we
have
some
idea
of
their
history
their
motives
their
general
modus
operandi
we
now
know
i
hope
who
they
are
where
they
came
from
and
more
or
less
what
they
want
in
the
next
section
of
this
book
law
and
order
we
will
leave
this
milieu
and
directly
enter
the
world
of
america
police
at
this
point
however
i
have
another
figure
to
introduce
myself
my
name
is
bruce
sterling
i
live
in
austin
texas
where
i
am
a
science
fiction
writer
by
trade
specifically
a
cyberpunk
science
fiction
writer
like
my
cyberpunk
colleagues
in
the
and
canada
i
never
been
entirely
happy
with
this
literary
label
especially
after
it
became
a
synonym
for
computer
criminal
but
i
did
once
edit
a
book
of
stories
by
my
colleagues
called
mirrorshades
the
cyberpunk
anthology
and
long
been
a
writer
of
cyberpunk
manifestos
i
am
not
a
hacker
of
any
description
though
i
do
have
readers
in
the
digital
underground
when
the
steve
jackson
games
seizure
occurred
i
naturally
took
an
intense
interest
if
cyberpunk
books
were
being
banned
by
federal
police
in
my
own
home
town
i
reasonably
wondered
whether
i
myself
might
be
next
would
my
computer
be
seized
by
the
secret
service
at
the
time
i
was
in
possession
of
an
aging
apple
iie
without
so
much
as
a
hard
disk
if
i
were
to
be
raided
as
an
author
of
manuals
the
loss
of
my
feeble
would
likely
provoke
more
snickers
than
sympathy
i
known
steve
jackson
for
many
years
we
knew
one
another
as
colleagues
for
we
frequented
the
same
local
conventions
i
played
jackson
games
and
recognized
his
cleverness
but
he
certainly
had
never
struck
me
as
a
potential
mastermind
of
computer
crime
i
also
knew
a
little
about
computer
systems
in
the
i
had
taken
an
active
role
in
an
austin
board
called
one
of
the
first
boards
dedicated
to
science
fiction
i
had
a
modem
and
on
occasion
i
logged
on
to
illuminati
which
always
looked
entertainly
wacky
but
certainly
harmless
enough
at
the
time
of
the
jackson
seizure
i
had
no
experience
whatsoever
with
underground
boards
but
i
knew
that
no
one
on
illuminati
talked
about
breaking
into
systems
illegally
or
about
robbing
phone
companies
illuminati
did
even
offer
pirated
computer
games
steve
jackson
like
many
creative
artists
was
markedly
touchy
about
theft
of
intellectual
property
it
seemed
to
me
that
jackson
was
either
seriously
suspected
of
some
crime
in
which
case
he
would
be
charged
soon
and
would
have
his
day
in
court
or
else
he
was
innocent
in
which
case
the
secret
service
would
quickly
return
his
equipment
and
everyone
would
have
a
good
laugh
i
rather
expected
the
good
laugh
the
situation
was
not
without
its
comic
side
the
raid
known
as
the
cyberpunk
bust
in
the
science
fiction
community
was
winning
a
great
deal
of
free
national
publicity
both
for
jackson
himself
and
the
cyberpunk
science
fiction
writers
generally
besides
science
fiction
people
are
used
to
being
misinterpreted
science
fiction
is
a
colorful
disreputable
slipshod
occupation
full
of
unlikely
oddballs
which
of
course
is
why
we
like
it
weirdness
can
be
an
occupational
hazard
in
our
field
people
who
wear
halloween
costumes
are
sometimes
mistaken
for
monsters
once
upon
a
time
back
in
in
new
york
city
science
fiction
and
the
secret
service
collided
in
a
comic
case
of
mistaken
identity
this
weird
incident
involved
a
literary
group
quite
famous
in
science
fiction
known
as
the
futurians
whose
membership
included
such
future
genre
greats
as
isaac
asimov
frederik
pohl
and
damon
knight
the
futurians
were
every
bit
as
offbeat
and
wacky
as
any
of
their
spiritual
descendants
including
the
cyberpunks
and
were
given
to
communal
living
spontaneous
group
renditions
of
light
opera
and
midnight
fencing
exhibitions
on
the
lawn
the
futurians
did
have
bulletin
board
systems
but
they
did
have
the
technological
equivalent
in
mimeographs
and
a
private
printing
press
these
were
in
steady
use
producing
a
stream
of
fan
magazines
literary
manifestos
and
weird
articles
which
were
picked
up
in
bundles
by
a
succession
of
strange
gangly
spotty
young
men
in
fedoras
and
overcoats
the
neighbors
grew
alarmed
at
the
antics
of
the
futurians
and
reported
them
to
the
secret
service
as
suspected
counterfeiters
in
the
winter
of
a
squad
of
usss
agents
with
drawn
guns
burst
into
futurian
house
prepared
to
confiscate
the
forged
currency
and
illicit
printing
presses
there
they
discovered
a
slumbering
science
fiction
fan
named
george
hahn
a
guest
of
the
futurian
commune
who
had
just
arrived
in
new
york
george
hahn
managed
to
explain
himself
and
his
group
and
the
secret
service
agents
left
the
futurians
in
peace
henceforth
alas
hahn
died
in
just
before
i
had
discovered
this
astonishing
historical
parallel
and
just
before
i
could
interview
him
for
this
book
but
the
jackson
case
did
not
come
to
a
swift
and
comic
end
no
quick
answers
came
his
way
or
mine
no
swift
reassurances
that
all
was
right
in
the
digital
world
that
matters
were
well
in
hand
after
all
quite
the
opposite
in
my
alternate
role
as
a
sometime
journalist
i
interviewed
jackson
and
his
staff
for
an
article
in
a
british
magazine
the
strange
details
of
the
raid
left
me
more
concerned
than
ever
without
its
computers
the
company
had
been
financially
and
operationally
crippled
half
the
sjg
workforce
a
group
of
entirely
innocent
people
had
been
sorrowfully
fired
deprived
of
their
livelihoods
by
the
seizure
it
began
to
dawn
on
me
that
authors
american
writers
might
well
have
their
computers
seized
under
sealed
warrants
without
any
criminal
charge
and
that
as
steve
jackson
had
discovered
there
was
no
immediate
recourse
for
this
this
was
no
joke
this
was
science
fiction
this
was
real
i
determined
to
put
science
fiction
aside
until
i
had
discovered
what
had
happened
and
where
this
trouble
had
come
from
it
was
time
to
enter
the
purportedly
real
world
of
electronic
free
expression
and
computer
crime
hence
this
book
hence
the
world
of
the
telcos
and
the
world
of
the
digital
underground
and
next
the
world
of
the
police
part
three
law
and
order
of
the
various
activities
of
operation
sundevil
had
by
far
the
highest
public
profile
the
sweeping
nationwide
computer
seizures
of
may
were
unprecedented
in
scope
and
highly
if
rather
selectively
publicized
unlike
the
efforts
of
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
operation
sundevil
was
not
intended
to
combat
hacking
in
the
sense
of
computer
intrusion
or
sophisticated
raids
on
telco
switching
stations
nor
did
it
have
anything
to
do
with
hacker
misdeeds
with
at
t
software
or
with
southern
bell
proprietary
documents
instead
operation
sundevil
was
a
crackdown
on
those
traditional
scourges
of
the
digital
underground
theft
and
telephone
code
abuse
the
ambitious
activities
out
of
chicago
and
the
somewhat
but
vigorous
actions
of
the
new
york
state
police
in
were
never
a
part
of
operation
sundevil
per
se
which
was
based
in
arizona
nevertheless
after
the
spectacular
may
raids
the
public
misled
by
police
secrecy
hacker
panic
and
a
puzzled
national
conflated
all
aspects
of
the
nationwide
crackdown
in
under
the
blanket
term
operation
sundevil
sundevil
is
still
the
synonym
for
the
crackdown
of
but
the
arizona
organizers
of
sundevil
did
not
really
deserve
this
reputation
any
more
for
instance
than
all
hackers
deserve
a
reputation
as
hackers
there
was
some
justice
in
this
confused
perception
though
for
one
thing
the
confusion
was
abetted
by
the
washington
office
of
the
secret
service
who
responded
to
freedom
of
information
act
requests
on
operation
sundevil
by
referring
investigators
to
the
publicly
known
cases
of
knight
lightning
and
the
atlanta
three
and
sundevil
was
certainly
the
largest
aspect
of
the
crackdown
the
most
deliberate
and
the
as
a
crackdown
on
electronic
fraud
sundevil
lacked
the
frantic
pace
of
the
war
on
the
legion
of
doom
on
the
contrary
sundevil
targets
were
picked
out
with
cool
deliberation
over
an
elaborate
investigation
lasting
two
full
years
and
once
again
the
targets
were
bulletin
board
systems
boards
can
be
powerful
aids
to
organized
fraud
underground
boards
carry
lively
extensive
detailed
and
often
quite
flagrant
discussions
of
lawbreaking
techniques
and
lawbreaking
activities
discussing
crime
in
the
abstract
or
discussing
the
particulars
of
criminal
cases
is
not
illegal
but
there
are
stern
state
and
federal
laws
against
coldbloodedly
conspiring
in
groups
in
order
to
commit
crimes
in
the
eyes
of
police
people
who
actively
conspire
to
break
the
law
are
not
regarded
as
clubs
debating
salons
users
groups
or
free
speech
advocates
rather
such
people
tend
to
find
themselves
formally
indicted
by
prosecutors
as
gangs
racketeers
corrupt
organizations
and
organized
crime
figures
what
more
the
illicit
data
contained
on
outlaw
boards
goes
well
beyond
mere
acts
of
speech
possible
criminal
conspiracy
as
we
have
seen
it
was
common
practice
in
the
digital
underground
to
post
purloined
telephone
codes
on
boards
for
any
phreak
or
hacker
who
cared
to
abuse
them
is
posting
digital
booty
of
this
sort
supposed
to
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
hardly
though
the
issue
like
most
issues
in
cyberspace
is
not
entirely
resolved
some
theorists
argue
that
to
merely
recite
a
number
publicly
is
not
illegal
only
its
use
is
illegal
but
police
point
out
that
magazines
and
newspapers
more
traditional
forms
of
free
expression
never
publish
stolen
telephone
codes
even
though
this
might
well
raise
their
circulation
stolen
credit
card
numbers
being
riskier
and
more
valuable
were
less
often
publicly
posted
on
boards
but
there
is
no
question
that
some
underground
boards
carried
carding
traffic
generally
exchanged
through
private
mail
underground
boards
also
carried
handy
programs
for
scanning
telephone
codes
and
raiding
credit
card
companies
as
well
as
the
usual
obnoxious
galaxy
of
pirated
software
cracked
passwords
schematics
intrusion
manuals
anarchy
files
porn
files
and
so
forth
but
besides
their
nuisance
potential
for
the
spread
of
illicit
knowledge
bulletin
boards
have
another
vitally
interesting
aspect
for
the
professional
investigator
bulletin
boards
are
of
evidence
all
that
busy
trading
of
electronic
mail
all
those
hacker
boasts
brags
and
struts
even
the
stolen
codes
and
cards
can
be
neat
electronic
recordings
of
criminal
activity
as
an
investigator
when
you
seize
a
pirate
board
you
have
scored
a
coup
as
effective
as
tapping
phones
or
intercepting
mail
however
you
have
not
actually
tapped
a
phone
or
intercepted
a
letter
the
rules
of
evidence
regarding
and
mail
interceptions
are
old
stern
and
by
police
prosecutors
and
defense
attorneys
alike
the
rules
of
evidence
regarding
boards
are
new
waffling
and
understood
by
nobody
at
all
sundevil
was
the
largest
crackdown
on
boards
in
world
history
on
may
and
about
computer
systems
were
seized
of
those
computers
about
actually
were
running
boards
the
vagueness
of
this
estimate
is
attributable
to
the
vagueness
of
a
what
a
computer
system
is
and
b
what
it
actually
means
to
run
a
board
with
one
or
with
two
computers
or
with
three
about
boards
vanished
into
police
custody
in
may
as
we
have
seen
there
are
an
estimated
boards
in
america
today
if
we
assume
that
one
board
in
a
hundred
is
up
to
no
good
with
codes
and
cards
which
rather
flatters
the
honesty
of
the
community
then
that
would
leave
outlaw
boards
untouched
by
sundevil
sundevil
seized
about
one
tenth
of
one
percent
of
all
computer
bulletin
boards
in
america
seen
objectively
this
is
something
less
than
a
comprehensive
assault
in
sundevil
organizers
the
team
at
the
phoenix
secret
service
office
and
the
arizona
attorney
general
office
had
a
list
of
at
least
three
hundred
boards
that
they
considered
fully
deserving
of
search
and
seizure
warrants
the
boards
actually
seized
were
merely
among
the
most
obvious
and
egregious
of
this
much
larger
list
of
candidates
all
these
boards
had
been
examined
beforehand
either
by
informants
who
had
passed
printouts
to
the
secret
service
or
by
secret
service
agents
themselves
who
not
only
come
equipped
with
modems
but
know
how
to
use
them
there
were
a
number
of
motives
for
sundevil
first
it
offered
a
chance
to
get
ahead
of
the
curve
on
crimes
tracking
back
ripoffs
to
their
perpetrators
can
be
appallingly
difficult
if
these
miscreants
have
any
kind
of
electronic
sophistication
they
can
snarl
their
tracks
through
the
phone
network
into
a
untraceable
mess
while
still
managing
to
reach
out
and
rob
someone
boards
however
full
of
brags
and
boasts
codes
and
cards
offer
evidence
in
the
handy
congealed
form
seizures
themselves
the
mere
physical
removal
of
machines
tends
to
take
the
pressure
off
during
sundevil
a
large
number
of
code
kids
warez
and
credit
card
thieves
would
be
deprived
of
those
boards
their
means
of
community
and
conspiracy
in
one
swift
blow
as
for
the
sysops
themselves
commonly
among
the
boldest
offenders
they
would
be
directly
stripped
of
their
computer
equipment
and
rendered
digitally
mute
and
blind
and
this
aspect
of
sundevil
was
carried
out
with
great
success
sundevil
seems
to
have
been
a
complete
tactical
surprise
unlike
the
fragmentary
and
continuing
seizures
of
the
war
on
the
legion
of
doom
sundevil
was
precisely
timed
and
utterly
overwhelming
at
least
forty
computers
were
seized
during
may
and
in
cincinnati
detroit
los
angeles
miami
newark
phoenix
tucson
richmond
san
diego
san
jose
pittsburgh
and
san
francisco
some
cities
saw
multiple
raids
such
as
the
five
separate
raids
in
the
new
york
city
environs
plano
texas
essentially
a
suburb
of
the
worth
metroplex
and
a
hub
of
the
telecommunications
industry
saw
four
computer
seizures
chicago
ever
in
the
forefront
saw
its
own
local
sundevil
raid
briskly
carried
out
by
secret
service
agents
timothy
foley
and
barbara
golden
many
of
these
raids
occurred
not
in
the
cities
proper
but
in
associated
class
suburbs
places
like
mount
lebanon
pennsylvania
and
clark
lake
michigan
there
were
a
few
raids
on
offices
most
took
place
in
people
homes
the
classic
hacker
basements
and
bedrooms
the
sundevil
raids
were
searches
and
seizures
not
a
group
of
mass
arrests
there
were
only
four
arrests
during
sundevil
tony

longtime

bete
noire
of
the
arizona
racketeering
unit
was
arrested
in
tucson
on
may
ripco
sysop
of
an
outlaw
board
with
the
misfortune
to
exist
in
chicago
itself
was
also
arrested
on
illegal
weapons
charges
local
units
also
arrested
a
female
phone
phreak
named
electra
in
pennsylvania
and
a
male
juvenile
in
california
federal
agents
however
were
not
seeking
arrests
but
computers
hackers
are
generally
not
indicted
if
at
all
until
the
evidence
in
their
seized
computers
is
evaluated
a
process
that
can
take
weeks
months
even
years
when
hackers
are
arrested
on
the
spot
it
generally
an
arrest
for
other
reasons
drugs
illegal
weapons
show
up
in
a
good
third
of
computer
seizures
though
not
during
sundevil
that
scofflaw
teenage
hackers
or
their
parents
should
have
marijuana
in
their
homes
is
probably
not
a
shocking
revelation
but
the
surprisingly
common
presence
of
illegal
firearms
in
hacker
dens
is
a
bit
disquieting
a
personal
computer
can
be
a
great
equalizer
for
the
much
like
that
more
traditional
american
great
equalizer
the
personal
sixgun
maybe
it
not
all
that
surprising
that
some
guy
obsessed
with
power
through
illicit
technology
would
also
have
a
few
illicit
devices
around
an
element
of
the
digital
underground
particularly
dotes
on
those
anarchy
philes
and
this
element
tends
to
shade
into
the
crackpot
milieu
of
survivalists
and
the
this
is
not
to
say
that
hacker
raids
to
date
have
uncovered
any
major
or
illegal
arsenals
but
secret
service
agents
do
not
regard
hackers
as
just
kids
they
regard
hackers
as
unpredictable
people
bright
and
slippery
it
does
help
matters
that
the
hacker
himself
has
been
hiding
behind
his
keyboard
all
this
time
commonly
police
have
no
idea
what
he
looks
like
this
makes
him
an
unknown
quantity
someone
best
treated
with
proper
caution
to
date
no
hacker
has
come
out
shooting
though
they
do
sometimes
brag
on
boards
that
they
will
do
just
that
threats
of
this
sort
are
taken
seriously
secret
service
hacker
raids
tend
to
be
swift
comprehensive
even
and
agents
generally
burst
through
every
door
in
the
home
at
once
sometimes
with
drawn
guns
any
potential
resistance
is
swiftly
quelled
hacker
raids
are
usually
raids
on
people
homes
it
can
be
a
very
dangerous
business
to
raid
an
american
home
people
can
panic
when
strangers
invade
their
sanctum
statistically
speaking
the
most
dangerous
thing
a
policeman
can
do
is
to
enter
someone
home
the
second
most
dangerous
thing
is
to
stop
a
car
in
traffic
people
have
guns
in
their
homes
more
cops
are
hurt
in
homes
than
are
ever
hurt
in
biker
bars
or
massage
parlors
but
in
any
case
no
one
was
hurt
during
sundevil
or
indeed
during
any
part
of
the
hacker
crackdown
nor
were
there
any
allegations
of
any
physical
mistreatment
of
a
suspect
guns
were
pointed
interrogations
were
sharp
and
prolonged
but
no
one
in
claimed
any
act
of
brutality
by
any
crackdown
raider
in
addition
to
the
forty
or
so
computers
sundevil
reaped
floppy
disks
in
particularly
great
abundance
an
estimated
of
them
which
naturally
included
every
manner
of
illegitimate
data
pirated
games
stolen
codes
hot
credit
card
numbers
the
complete
text
and
software
of
entire
pirate
these
floppy
disks
which
remain
in
police
custody
today
offer
a
gigantic
almost
embarrassingly
rich
source
of
possible
criminal
indictments
these
floppy
disks
also
include
a
unknown
quantity
of
legitimate
computer
games
legitimate
software
purportedly
private
mail
from
boards
business
records
and
personal
correspondence
of
all
kinds
standard
search
warrants
lay
great
emphasis
on
seizing
written
documents
as
well
as
computers
specifically
including
photocopies
computer
printouts
telephone
bills
address
books
logs
notes
memoranda
and
correspondence
in
practice
this
has
meant
that
diaries
gaming
magazines
software
documentation
nonfiction
books
on
hacking
and
computer
security
sometimes
even
science
fiction
novels
have
all
vanished
out
the
door
in
police
custody
a
wide
variety
of
electronic
items
have
been
known
to
vanish
as
well
including
telephones
televisions
answering
machines
sony
walkmans
desktop
printers
compact
disks
and
audiotapes
no
fewer
than
members
of
the
secret
service
were
sent
into
the
field
during
sundevil
they
were
commonly
accompanied
by
squads
of
local
state
police
most
of
these
officers
especially
the
locals
had
never
been
on
an
raid
before
this
was
one
good
reason
in
fact
why
so
many
of
them
were
invited
along
in
the
first
place
also
the
presence
of
a
uniformed
police
officer
assures
the
raidees
that
the
people
entering
their
homes
are
in
fact
police
secret
service
agents
wear
plain
clothes
so
do
the
telco
security
experts
who
commonly
accompany
the
secret
service
on
raids
and
who
make
no
particular
effort
to
identify
themselves
as
mere
employees
of
telephone
companies
a
typical
hacker
raid
goes
something
like
this
first
police
storm
in
rapidly
through
every
entrance
with
overwhelming
force
in
the
assumption
that
this
tactic
will
keep
casualties
to
a
minimum
second
possible
suspects
are
immediately
removed
from
the
vicinity
of
any
and
all
computer
systems
so
that
they
will
have
no
chance
to
purge
or
destroy
computer
evidence
suspects
are
herded
into
a
room
without
computers
commonly
the
living
room
and
kept
under
guard
not
armed
guard
for
the
guns
are
swiftly
holstered
but
under
guard
nevertheless
they
are
presented
with
the
search
warrant
and
warned
that
anything
they
say
may
be
held
against
them
commonly
they
have
a
great
deal
to
say
especially
if
they
are
unsuspecting
parents
somewhere
in
the
house
is
the
hot
spot
a
computer
tied
to
a
phone
line
possibly
several
computers
and
several
phones
commonly
a
teenager
bedroom
but
it
can
be
anywhere
in
the
house
there
may
be
several
such
rooms
this
hot
spot
is
put
in
charge
of
a
team
the
finder
and
the
recorder
the
finder
is
commonly
the
case
agent
who
has
actually
obtained
the
search
warrant
from
a
judge
he
or
she
understands
what
is
being
sought
and
actually
carries
out
the
seizures
unplugs
machines
opens
drawers
desks
files
containers
etc
the
recorder
photographs
all
the
equipment
just
as
it
stands
especially
the
tangle
of
wired
connections
in
the
back
which
can
otherwise
be
a
real
nightmare
to
restore
the
recorder
will
also
commonly
photograph
every
room
in
the
house
lest
some
wily
criminal
claim
that
the
police
had
robbed
him
during
the
search
some
recorders
carry
videocams
or
tape
recorders
however
it
more
common
for
the
recorder
to
simply
take
written
notes
objects
are
described
and
numbered
as
the
finder
seizes
them
generally
on
standard
preprinted
police
inventory
forms
even
secret
service
agents
were
not
and
are
not
expert
computer
users
they
have
not
made
and
do
not
make
judgements
on
the
fly
about
potential
threats
posed
by
various
forms
of
equipment
they
may
exercise
discretion
they
may
leave
dad
his
computer
for
instance
but
they
do
have
to
standard
search
warrants
which
date
back
to
the
early
use
a
sweeping
language
that
targets
computers
most
anything
attached
to
a
computer
most
anything
used
to
operate
a
computer
most
anything
that
remotely
resembles
a
computer
plus
most
any
and
all
written
documents
surrounding
it
investigators
have
strongly
urged
agents
to
seize
the
works
in
this
sense
operation
sundevil
appears
to
have
been
a
complete
success
boards
went
down
all
over
america
and
were
shipped
en
masse
to
the
computer
investigation
lab
of
the
secret
service
in
washington
dc
along
with
the
floppy
disks
and
unknown
quantities
of
printed
material
but
the
seizure
of
boards
and
the
mountains
of
possibly
useful
evidence
contained
in
these
boards
and
in
their
other
computers
also
out
the
door
were
far
from
the
only
motives
for
operation
sundevil
an
unprecedented
action
of
great
ambition
and
size
sundevil
motives
can
only
be
described
as
political
it
was
a
effort
meant
to
pass
certain
messages
meant
to
make
certain
situations
clear
both
in
the
mind
of
the
general
public
and
in
the
minds
of
various
constituencies
of
the
electronic
community
first
and
this
motivation
was
vital
a
message
would
be
sent
from
law
enforcement
to
the
digital
underground
this
very
message
was
recited
in
so
many
words
by
garry
jenkins
the
assistant
director
of
the
us
secret
service
at
the
sundevil
press
conference
in
phoenix
on
may
immediately
after
the
raids
in
brief
hackers
were
mistaken
in
their
foolish
belief
that
they
could
hide
behind
the
relative
anonymity
of
their
computer
terminals
on
the
contrary
they
should
fully
understand
that
state
and
federal
cops
were
actively
patrolling
the
beat
in
cyberspace
that
they
were
on
the
watch
everywhere
even
in
those
sleazy
and
secretive
dens
of
cybernetic
vice
the
underground
boards
this
is
not
an
unusual
message
for
police
to
publicly
convey
to
crooks
the
message
is
a
standard
message
only
the
context
is
new
in
this
respect
the
sundevil
raids
were
the
digital
equivalent
of
the
standard
crackdown
on
massage
parlors
porno
bookstores
or
floating
there
may
be
few
or
no
arrests
in
a
raid
of
this
sort
no
convictions
no
trials
no
interrogations
in
cases
of
this
sort
police
may
well
walk
out
the
door
with
many
pounds
of
sleazy
magazines
videotapes
sex
toys
gambling
equipment
baggies
of
marijuana
of
course
if
something
truly
horrendous
is
discovered
by
the
raiders
there
will
be
arrests
and
prosecutions
far
more
likely
however
there
will
simply
be
a
brief
but
sharp
disruption
of
the
closed
and
secretive
world
of
the
nogoodniks
there
will
be
street
hassle
heat
deterrence
and
of
course
the
immediate
loss
of
the
seized
goods
it
is
very
unlikely
that
any
of
this
seized
material
will
ever
be
returned
whether
charged
or
not
whether
convicted
or
not
the
perpetrators
will
almost
surely
lack
the
nerve
ever
to
ask
for
this
stuff
to
be
given
back
arrests
and
trials
putting
people
in
jail
may
involve
all
kinds
of
formal
legalities
but
dealing
with
the
justice
system
is
far
from
the
only
task
of
police
police
do
not
simply
arrest
people
they
do
simply
put
people
in
jail
that
is
not
how
the
police
perceive
their
jobs
police
protect
and
serve
police
keep
the
peace
they
keep
public
order
like
other
forms
of
public
relations
keeping
public
order
is
not
an
exact
science
keeping
public
order
is
something
of
an
if
a
group
of
teenage
hoodlums
was
loitering
on
a
no
one
would
be
surprised
to
see
a
arrive
and
sternly
order
them
to
break
it
up
on
the
contrary
the
surprise
would
come
if
one
of
these
stepped
briskly
into
a
called
a
civil
rights
lawyer
and
instituted
a
civil
suit
in
defense
of
his
constitutional
rights
of
free
speech
and
free
assembly
but
something
much
along
this
line
was
one
of
the
many
anomolous
outcomes
of
the
hacker
crackdown
sundevil
also
carried
useful
messages
for
other
constituents
of
the
electronic
community
these
messages
may
not
have
been
read
aloud
from
the
phoenix
podium
in
front
of
the
press
corps
but
there
was
little
mistaking
their
meaning
there
was
a
message
of
reassurance
for
the
primary
victims
of
coding
and
carding
the
telcos
and
the
credit
companies
sundevil
was
greeted
with
joy
by
the
security
officers
of
the
electronic
business
community
after
years
of
harassment
and
spiralling
revenue
losses
their
complaints
of
rampant
outlawry
were
being
taken
seriously
by
law
enforcement
no
more
or
dismissive
shrugs
no
more
feeble
excuses
about
lack
of
officers
or
the
low
priority
of
victimless
telecommunication
crimes
experts
have
long
believed
that
offenses
are
drastically
they
regard
this
as
a
major
open
scandal
of
their
field
some
victims
are
reluctant
to
come
forth
because
they
believe
that
police
and
prosecutors
are
not
and
can
and
will
do
nothing
others
are
embarrassed
by
their
vulnerabilities
and
will
take
strong
measures
to
avoid
any
publicity
this
is
especially
true
of
banks
who
fear
a
loss
of
investor
confidence
should
an
or
surface
and
some
victims
are
so
helplessly
confused
by
their
own
high
technology
that
they
never
even
realize
that
a
crime
has
occurred
even
when
they
have
been
fleeced
to
the
bone
the
results
of
this
situation
can
be
dire
criminals
escape
apprehension
and
punishment
the
units
that
do
exist
ca
get
work
the
true
scope
of
its
size
its
real
nature
the
scope
of
its
threats
and
the
legal
remedies
for
it
all
remain
obscured
another
problem
is
very
little
publicized
but
it
is
a
cause
of
genuine
concern
where
there
is
persistent
crime
but
no
effective
police
protection
then
vigilantism
can
result
telcos
banks
credit
companies
the
major
corporations
who
maintain
extensive
computer
networks
vulnerable
to
hacking
these
organizations
are
powerful
wealthy
and
politically
influential
they
are
disinclined
to
be
pushed
around
by
crooks
or
by
most
anyone
else
for
that
matter
they
often
maintain
private
security
forces
commonly
run
by
experienced
veterans
of
military
and
police
units
who
have
left
public
service
for
the
greener
pastures
of
the
private
sector
for
police
the
corporate
security
manager
can
be
a
powerful
ally
but
if
this
gentleman
finds
no
allies
in
the
police
and
the
pressure
is
on
from
his
he
may
quietly
take
certain
matters
into
his
own
hands
nor
is
there
any
lack
of
disposable
in
the
corporate
security
business
private
security
agencies
the
business
generally
grew
explosively
in
the
today
there
are
spooky
gumshoed
armies
of
security
consultants
cops
private
eyes
outside
experts
every
manner
of
shady
operator
who
retails
in
results
and
discretion
or
course
many
of
these
gentlemen
and
ladies
may
be
paragons
of
professional
and
moral
rectitude
but
as
anyone
who
has
read
a
detective
novel
knows
police
tend
to
be
less
than
fond
of
this
sort
of
competition
companies
in
search
of
have
even
been
known
to
hire
hackers
police
shudder
at
this
prospect
police
treasure
good
relations
with
the
business
community
rarely
will
you
see
a
policeman
so
indiscreet
as
to
allege
publicly
that
some
major
employer
in
his
state
or
city
has
succumbed
to
paranoia
and
gone
off
the
rails
nevertheless
police
and
computer
police
in
particular
are
aware
of
this
possibility
police
can
and
do
spend
up
to
half
of
their
business
hours
just
doing
public
relations
seminars
dog
and
pony
shows
sometimes
with
parents
groups
or
computer
users
but
generally
with
their
core
audience
the
likely
victims
of
hacking
crimes
these
of
course
are
telcos
credit
card
companies
and
large
corporations
the
police
strongly
urge
these
people
as
good
citizens
to
report
offenses
and
press
criminal
charges
they
pass
the
message
that
there
is
someone
in
authority
who
cares
understands
and
best
of
all
will
take
useful
action
should
a
occur
but
reassuring
talk
is
cheap
sundevil
offered
action
the
final
message
of
sundevil
was
intended
for
internal
consumption
by
law
enforcement
sundevil
was
offered
as
proof
that
the
community
of
american
police
had
come
of
age
sundevil
was
proof
that
enormous
things
like
sundevil
itself
could
now
be
accomplished
sundevil
was
proof
that
the
secret
service
and
its
local
allies
could
act
like
a
machine
despite
the
hampering
use
of
those
scrambled
phones
it
was
also
proof
that
the
arizona
organized
crime
and
racketeering
unit
the
sparkplug
of
sundevil
ranked
with
the
best
in
the
world
in
ambition
organization
and
sheer
conceptual
daring
and
as
a
final
fillip
sundevil
was
a
message
from
the
secret
service
to
their
longtime
rivals
in
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
by
congressional
fiat
both
usss
and
fbi
formally
share
jurisdiction
over
federal
activities
neither
of
these
groups
has
ever
been
remotely
happy
with
this
muddled
situation
it
seems
to
suggest
that
congress
can
not
make
up
its
mind
as
to
which
of
these
groups
is
better
qualified
and
there
is
scarcely
a
or
a
special
agent
anywhere
without
a
very
firm
opinion
on
that
topic
for
the
neophyte
one
of
the
most
puzzling
aspects
of
the
crackdown
on
hackers
is
why
the
united
states
secret
service
has
anything
at
all
to
do
with
this
matter
the
secret
service
is
best
known
for
its
primary
public
role
its
agents
protect
the
president
of
the
united
states
they
also
guard
the
president
family
the
vice
president
and
his
family
former
presidents
and
presidential
candidates
they
sometimes
guard
foreign
dignitaries
who
are
visiting
the
united
states
especially
foreign
heads
of
state
and
have
been

special

of

the

also
has
two
uniformed

agencies
there
the
former

now
known
as
the
secret

uniformed

since
they
currently
guard
foreign

in

as

as
the
white

itself
and
there
the
uniformed
treasury
police
force
the
secret

has
been
charged
by
congress
with
a
number
of
duties
they
guard
the
precious

vaults
they
guard

the

a

of

secret

special

there
are
about

they
all
work
for

the

through
its

the

the

as

the
secret

guards
the

currency
it
is
the
only
federal
law
enforcement
agency
with
direct
jurisdiction
over
counterfeiting
and
forgery
it
analyzes
documents
for
authenticity
and
its
fight
against
fake
cash
is
still
quite
lively
especially
since
the
skilled
counterfeiters
of
medellin
columbia
have
gotten
into
the
act
government
checks
bonds
and
other
obligations
which
exist
in
untold
millions
and
are
worth
untold
billions
are
common
targets
for
forgery
which
the
secret
service
also
battles
it
even
handles
forgery
of
postage
stamps
but
cash
is
fading
in
importance
today
as
money
has
become
electronic
as
necessity
beckoned
the
secret
service
moved
from
fighting
the
counterfeiting
of
paper
currency
and
the
forging
of
checks
to
the
protection
of
funds
transferred
by
wire
from
it
was
a
simple
to
what
is
formally
known
as
access
device
fraud
congress
granted
the
secret
service
the
authority
to
investigate
access
device
fraud
under
title
of
the
united
states
code
section
the
term
access
device
seems
intuitively
simple
it
some
kind
of
gizmo
you
use
to
get
money
with
it
makes
good
sense
to
put
this
sort
of
thing
in
the
charge
of
counterfeiting
and
experts
however
in
section
the
term
access
device
is
very
generously
defined
an
access
device
is
any
card
plate
code
account
number
or
other
means
of
account
access
that
can
be
used
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
another
access
device
to
obtain
money
goods
services
or
any
other
thing
of
value
or
that
can
be
used
to
initiate
a
transfer
of
funds
access
device
can
therefore
be
construed
to
include
credit
cards
themselves
a
popular
forgery
item
nowadays
it
also
includes
credit
card
account
numbers
those
standards
of
the
digital
underground
the
same
goes
for
telephone
charge
cards
an
increasingly
popular
item
with
telcos
who
are
tired
of
being
robbed
of
pocket
change
by
thieves
and
also
telephone
access
codes
those
other
standards
of
the
digital
underground
stolen
telephone
codes
may
not
obtain
money
but
they
certainly
do
obtain
valuable
services
which
is
specifically
forbidden
by
section
we
can
now
see
that
section
already
pits
the
united
states
secret
service
directly
against
the
digital
underground
without
any
mention
at
all
of
the
word
computer
standard
phreaking
devices
like
blue
boxes
used
to
steal
phone
service
from
mechanical
switches
are
unquestionably
counterfeit
access
devices
thanks
to
it
is
not
only
illegal
to
use
counterfeit
access
devices
but
it
is
even
illegal
to
build
them
producing
designing
duplicating
or
assembling
blue
boxes
are
all
federal
crimes
today
and
if
you
do
this
the
secret
service
has
been
charged
by
congress
to
come
after
you
automatic
teller
machines
which
replicated
all
over
america
during
the

definitely
access
devices
too
and
an
attempt
to
tamper
with
their
codes
and
plastic
bank
cards
falls
directly
under
sec
section
is
remarkably
elastic
suppose
you
find
a
computer
password
in
somebody
trash
that
password
might
be
a
code
it
certainly
a
means
of
account
access
now
suppose
you
log
on
to
a
computer
and
copy
some
software
for
yourself
you
certainly
obtained

and
a
thing
of
value
the
software
suppose
you
tell
a
dozen
friends
about
your
swiped
password
and
let
them
use
it
too
now
you
trafficking
in
unauthorized
access
devices
and
when
the
prophet
a
member
of
the
legion

they

charged

there
are
two
limitations
on
section
first
the
offense
must
affect
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
in
order
to
become
a
matter
of
federal
jurisdiction
the
term
affecting
commerce
is
not
well
defined
but
you
may
take
it
as
a
given
that
the
secret
service
can
take
an
interest
if
you
done
most
anything
that
happens
to
cross
a
state
line
state
and
local
police
can
be
touchy
about
their
jurisdictions
and
can
sometimes
be
mulish
when
the
feds
show
up
but
when
it
comes
to
the
local
police
are
pathetically
grateful
for
federal
help
in
fact
they
complain
that
they
ca
get
enough
of
it
if
you
stealing
service
you
almost
certainly
crossing
state
lines
and
you
definitely
affecting
the
interstate
commerce
of
the
telcos
and
if
you
abusing
credit
cards
by
ordering
stuff
out
of
glossy
catalogs
from
say
vermont
you
in
for
it
the
second
limitation
is
money
as
a
rule
the
feds
do
pursue
offenders
federal
judges
will
dismiss
cases
that
appear
to
waste
their
time
federal
crimes
must
be
serious
section
specifies
a
minimum
loss
of
a
thousand
dollars
we
now
come
to
the
very
next
section
of
title
which
is
section
fraud
and
related
activity
in
connection
with
computers
this
statute
gives
the
secret
service
direct
jurisdiction
over
acts
of
computer
intrusion
on
the
face
of
it
the
secret
service
would
now
seem
to
command
the
field
section
however
is
nowhere
near
so
ductile
as
section
the
first
annoyance
is
section
d
which
reads
d
the
united
states
secret
service
shall
in
addition
to
any
other
agency
having
such
authority
have
the
authority
to
investigate
offenses
under
this
section
such
authority
of
the
united
states
secret
service
shall
be
exercised
in
accordance
with
an
agreement
which
shall
be
entered
into
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
attorney
general
author
italics
represented
by
capitals
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
is
the
titular
head
of
the
secret
service
while
the
attorney
general
is
in
charge
of
the
fbi
in
section
d
congress
shrugged
off
responsibility
for
the
between
the
service
and
the
bureau
and
made
them
fight
it
out
all
by
themselves
the
result
was
a
rather
dire
one
for
the
secret
service
for
the
fbi
ended
up
with
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
computer
having
to
do
with
national
security
foreign
espionage
federally
insured
banks
and
military
bases
while
retaining
joint
jurisdiction
over
all
the
other
computer
intrusions
essentially
when
it
comes
to
section
the
fbi
not
only
gets
the
real
glamor
stuff
for
itself
but
can
peer
over
the
shoulder
of
the
secret
service
and
barge
in
to
meddle
whenever
it
suits
them
the
second
problem
has
to
do
with
the
dicey
term
federal
interest
computer
section
a
makes
it
illegal
to
access
a
computer
without
authorization
if
that
computer
belongs
to
a
financial
institution
or
an
issuer
of
credit
cards
fraud
cases
in
other
words
congress
was
quite
willing
to
give
the
secret
service
jurisdiction
over
computers
but
congress
balked
at
letting
them
investigate
any
and
all
computer
intrusions
instead
the
usss
had
to
settle
for
the
money
machines
and
the
federal
interest
computers
a
federal
interest
computer
is
a
computer
which
the
government
itself
owns
or
is
using
large
networks
of
interstate
computers
linked
over
state
lines
are
also
considered
to
be
of
federal
interest
this
notion
of
federal
interest
is
legally
rather
foggy
and
has
never
been
clearly
defined
in
the
courts
the
secret
service
has
never
yet
had
its
hand
slapped
for
investigating
computer
that
were
not
of
federal
interest
but
conceivably
someday
this
might
happen
so
the
secret
service
authority
over
unauthorized
access
to
computers
covers
a
lot
of
territory
but
by
no
means
the
whole
ball
of
cyberspatial
wax
if
you
are
for
instance
a
local
computer
retailer
or
the
owner
of
a
local
bulletin
board
system
then
a
malicious
local
intruder
can
break
in
crash
your
system
trash
your
files
and
scatter
viruses
and
the
secret
service
can
not
do
a
single
thing
about
it
at
least
it
ca
do
anything
directly
but
the
secret
service
will
do
plenty
to
help
the
local
people
who
can
the
fbi
may
have
dealt
itself
an
ace
off
the
bottom
of
the
deck
when
it
comes
to
section
but
that
not
the
whole
story
that
not
the
street
what
congress
thinks
is
one
thing
and
congress
has
been
known
to
change
its
mind
the
real
is
out
there
in
the
streets
where
it
happening
if
you
a
local
with
a
computer
problem
the
secret
service
wants
you
to
know
where
you
can
find
the
real
expertise
while
the

are
off
having
their
favorite
shoes

the

of
every

need
advice
they
give
you
advice
or
at
least
point
you
in
the
right
direction
need
training
they
can
see
to
that
too
if

you

the

the

is
not

the

secret

agents
are

and
the
real
glory
in
service
work
is
not
in
battling

not

but
in
protecting

the

of

work
is
in

if

at

then
the

see
you
on

you
rub

in

that
the
real

of

work
the
number

than

has
stopped
dead

vanished

romance
in
the
work
of
the
service
the
intimate
access
to
circles
of
great
power
the
of
a
highly
trained
and
disciplined
elite
the
high
responsibility
of
defending
the
chief

the
fulfillment
of
a
patriotic
duty
and
as

work
goes
the

not

there
squalor
in

work
too
you
may
get
spat
upon
by
protesters
howling
abuse
and
if
they
get
violent
if
they
get
too
close
sometimes
you
have
to
knock
one
of
them
down
discreetly
the
real
squalor
in
service
work
is
drudgery
such
as
the
quarterlies
traipsing
out
four
times
a
year
year
in
year
out
to
interview
the
various
pathetic
wretches
many
of
them
in
prisons
and
asylums
who
have
seen
fit
to
threaten
the
president
life
and
then
there
the
grinding
stress
of
searching
all
those
faces
in
the
endless
bustling
crowds
looking
for
hatred
looking
for
psychosis
looking
for
the
tight
nervous
face
of
an
arthur
bremer
a
squeaky
fromme
a
lee
harvey
oswald
it
watching
all
those
grasping
waving
hands
for
sudden
movements
while
your
ears
strain
at
your
radio
headphone
for
the
cry
of
gun
it
poring
in
grinding
detail
over
the
biographies
of
every
rotten
loser
who
ever
shot
at
a
president
it
the
unsung
work
of
the
protective
research
section
who
study
scrawled
anonymous
death
threats
with
all
the
meticulous
tools
of
techniques
and
it
maintaining
the
hefty
computerized
files
on
anyone
who
ever
threatened
the
president
life
civil
libertarians
have
become
increasingly
concerned
at
the
government
use
of
computer
files
to
track
american
citizens
but
the
secret
service
file
of
potential
presidential
assassins
which
has
upward
of
twenty
thousand
names
rarely
causes
a
peep
of
protest
if
you
ever
state
that
you
intend
to
kill
the
president
the
secret
service
will
want
to
know
and
record
who
you
are
where
you
are
what
you
are
and
what
you
up
to
if
you
a
serious
threat
if
you
officially
considered
of
protective
interest
then
the
secret
service
may
well
keep
tabs
on
you
for
the
rest
of
your
natural
life
protecting
the
president
has
first
call
on
all
the
service
resources
but
there
a
lot
more
to
the
service
traditions
and
history
than
standing
guard
outside
the
oval
office
the
secret
service
is
the
nation
oldest
general
federal
agency
compared
to
the
secret
service
the
fbi
are
and
the
cia
are
temps
the
secret
service
was
founded
back
in
at
the
suggestion
of
hugh
mcculloch
abraham
lincoln
secretary
of
the
treasury
mcculloch
wanted
a
specialized
treasury
police
to
combat
counterfeiting
abraham
lincoln
agreed
that
this
seemed
a
good
idea
and
with
a
terrible
irony
abraham
lincoln
was
shot
that
very
night
by
john
wilkes
booth
the
secret
service
originally
had
nothing
to
do
with
protecting
presidents
they
did
take
this
on
as
a
regular
assignment
until
after
the
garfield
assassination
in
and
they
did
get
any
congressional
money
for
it
until
president
mckinley
was
shot
in
the
service
was
originally
designed
for
one
purpose
destroying
counterfeiters
there
are
interesting
parallels
between
the
entry
into
counterfeiting
and
america
entry
into
in
america
paper
currency
was
a
terrible
muddle
security
was
drastically
bad
currency
was
printed
on
the
spot
by
local
banks
in
literally
hundreds
of
different
designs
no
one
really
knew
what
the
heck
a
dollar
bill
was
supposed
to
look
like
bogus
bills
passed
easily
if
some
joker
told
you
that
a
bill
from
the
railroad
bank
of
lowell
massachusetts
had
a
woman
leaning
on
a
shield
with
a
locomotive
a
cornucopia
a
compass
various
agricultural
implements
a
railroad
bridge
and
some
factories
then
you
pretty
much
had
to
take
his
word
for
it
and
in
fact
he
was
telling
the
truth
sixteen
hundred
local
american
banks
designed
and
printed
their
own
paper
currency
and
there
were
no
general
standards
for
security
like
a
badly
guarded
node
in
a
computer
network
badly
designed
bills
were
easy
to
fake
and
posed
a
security
hazard
for
the
entire
monetary
system
no
one
knew
the
exact
extent
of
the
threat
to
the
currency
there
were
panicked
estimates
that
as
much
as
a
third
of
the
entire
national
currency
was
faked
counterfeiters
known
as
boodlers
in
the
underground
slang
of
the
time
were
mostly
technically
skilled
printers
who
had
gone
to
the
bad
many
had
once
worked
printing
legitimate
currency
boodlers
operated
in
rings
and
gangs
technical
experts
engraved
the
bogus
plates
commonly
in
basements
in
new
york
city
smooth
confidence
men
passed
large
wads
of
fakes
including
the
really
sophisticated
stuff
government
bonds
stock
certificates
and
railway
shares
cheaper
botched
fakes
were
sold
or
sharewared
to
gangs
of
boodler
wannabes
the
really
cheesy
lowlife
boodlers
merely
upgraded
real
bills
by
altering
face
values
changing
ones
to
fives
tens
to
hundreds
and
so
on
the
techniques
of
boodling
were
and
regarded
with
a
certain
awe
by
the
public
the
ability
to
manipulate
the
system
for
seemed
diabolically
clever
as
the
skill
and
daring
of
the
boodlers
increased
the
situation
became
intolerable
the
federal
government
stepped
in
and
began
offering
its
own
federal
currency
which
was
printed
in
fancy
green
ink
but
only
on
the
back
the
original
greenbacks
and
at
first
the
improved
security
of
the
federal
greenbacks
seemed
to
solve
the
problem
but
then
the
counterfeiters
caught
on
within
a
few
years
things
were
worse
than
ever
a
centralized
system
where
all
security
was
bad
the
local
police
were
helpless
the
government
tried
offering
blood
money
to
potential
informants
but
this
met
with
little
success
banks
plagued
by
boodling
gave
up
hope
of
police
help
and
hired
private
security
men
instead
merchants
and
bankers
queued
up
by
the
thousands
to
buy
manuals
on
currency
security
slim
little
books
like
laban
heath
infallible
government
counterfeit
detector
the
back
of
the
book
offered
laban
patent
microscope
for
five
bucks
then
the
secret
service
entered
the
picture
the
first
agents
were
a
rough
and
ready
crew
their
chief
was
one
william
wood
a
former
guerilla
in
the
mexican
war
who
won
a
reputation
busting
contractor
fraudsters
for
the
war
department
during
the
civil
war
wood
who
was
also
keeper
of
the
capital
prison
had
a
sideline
as
a
counterfeiting
expert
bagging
boodlers
for
the
federal
bounty
money
wood
was
named
chief
of
the
new
secret
service
in
july
there
were
only
ten
secret
service
agents
in
all
wood
himself
a
handful
who
worked
for
him
in
the
war
department
and
a
few
former
private
investigators
counterfeiting
experts
whom
wood
had
won
over
to
public
service
the
secret
service
of
was
much
the
size
of
the
chicago
computer
fraud
task
force
or
the
arizona
racketeering
unit
of
these
ten
operatives
had
an
additional
twenty
or
so
assistant
operatives
and
informants
besides
salary
and
per
diem
each
secret
service
employee
received
a
whopping
dollars
for
each
boodler
he
captured
wood
himself
publicly
estimated
that
at
least
half
of
america
currency
was
counterfeit
a
perhaps
pardonable
perception
within
a
year
the
secret
service
had
arrested
over
counterfeiters
they
busted
about
two
hundred
boodlers
a
year
for
four
years
straight
wood
attributed
his
success
to
travelling
fast
and
light
hitting
the
hard
and
avoiding
bureaucratic
baggage
because
my
raids
were
made
without
military
escort
and
i
did
not
ask
the
assistance
of
state
officers
i
surprised
the
professional
counterfeiter
wood
social
message
to
the
boodlers
bore
an
eerie
ring
of
sundevil
it
was
also
my
purpose
to
convince
such
characters
that
it
would
no
longer
be
healthy
for
them
to
ply
their
vocation
without
being
handled
roughly
a
fact
they
soon
discovered
william
wood
the
secret
service
guerilla
pioneer
did
not
end
well
he
succumbed
to
the
lure
of
aiming
for
the
really
big
score
the
notorious
brockway
gang
of
new
york
city
headed
by
william
brockway
the
king
of
the
counterfeiters
had
forged
a
number
of
government
bonds
they
passed
these
brilliant
fakes
on
the
prestigious
wall
street
investment
firm
of
jay
cooke
and
company
the
cooke
firm
were
frantic
and
offered
a
huge
reward
for
the
forgers
plates
laboring
diligently
wood
confiscated
the
plates
though
not
brockway
and
claimed
the
reward
but
the
cooke
company
treacherously
reneged
wood
got
involved
in
a
lawsuit
with
the
cooke
capitalists
wood
boss
secretary
of
the
treasury
mcculloch
felt
that
wood
demands
for
money
and
glory
were
unseemly
and
even
when
the
reward
money
finally
came
through
mcculloch
refused
to
pay
wood
anything
wood
found
himself
mired
in
a
seemingly
endless
round
of
federal
suits
and
congressional
lobbying
wood
never
got
his
money
and
he
lost
his
job
to
boot
he
resigned
in
wood
agents
suffered
too
on
may
the
second
chief
of
the
secret
service
took
over
and
almost
immediately
fired
most
of
wood
pioneer
secret
service
agents
operatives
assistants
and
informants
alike
the
practice
of
receiving
per
crook
was
abolished
and
the
secret
service
began
the
long
uncertain
process
of
thorough
professionalization
wood
ended
badly
he
must
have
felt
stabbed
in
the
back
in
fact
his
entire
organization
was
mangled
on
the
other
hand
william
wood
was
the
first
head
of
the
secret
service
william
wood
was
the
pioneer
people
still
honor
his
name
who
remembers
the
name
of
the
second
head
of
the
secret
service
as
for
william
brockway
also
known
as
colonel
spencer
he
was
finally
arrested
by
the
secret
service
in
he
did
five
years
in
prison
got
out
and
was
still
boodling
at
the
age
of
anyone
with
an
interest
in
operation
sundevil
or
in
american
generally
could
scarcely
miss
the
presence
of
gail
thackeray
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
arizona
training
manuals
often
cited
thackeray
group
and
her
work
she
was
the
state
official
to
specialize
in
offenses
her
name
had
been
on
the
sundevil
press
release
though
modestly
ranked
well
after
the
local
federal
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
head
of
the
phoenix
secret
service
office
as
public
commentary
and
controversy
began
to
mount
about
the
hacker
crackdown
this
arizonan
state
official
began
to
take
a
higher
and
higher
public
profile
though
uttering
almost
nothing
specific
about
the
sundevil
operation
itself
she
coined
some
of
the
most
striking
soundbites
of
the
growing
propaganda
war
agents
are
operating
in
good
faith
and
i
do
think
you
can
say
that
for
the
hacker
community
was
one
another
was
the
memorable
i
am
not
a
mad
dog
prosecutor
houston
chronicle
sept
in
the
meantime
the
secret
service
maintained
its
usual
extreme
discretion
the
chicago
unit
smarting
from
the
backlash
of
the
steve
jackson
scandal
had
gone
completely
to
earth
as
i
collated
my
growing
pile
of
newspaper
clippings
gail
thackeray
ranked
as
a
comparative
fount
of
public
knowledge
on
police
operations
i
decided
that
i
had
to
get
to
know
gail
thackeray
i
wrote
to
her
at
the
arizona
attorney
general
office
not
only
did
she
kindly
reply
to
me
but
to
my
astonishment
she
knew
very
well
what
cyberpunk
science
fiction
was
shortly
after
this
gail
thackeray
lost
her
job
and
i
temporarily
misplaced
my
own
career
as
a
writer
to
become
a
journalist
in
early
march
i
flew
to
phoenix
arizona
to
interview
gail
thackeray
for
my
book
on
the
hacker
crackdown
credit
cards
did
used
to
cost
anything
to
get
says
gail
thackeray
now
they
cost
forty
bucks
and
that
all
just
to
cover
the
costs
from
artists
electronic
nuisance
criminals
are
parasites
one
by
one
they
not
much
harm
no
big
deal
but
they
never
come
just
one
by
one
they
come
in
swarms
heaps
legions
sometimes
whole
subcultures
and
they
bite
every
time
we
buy
a
credit
card
today
we
lose
a
little
financial
vitality
to
a
particular
species
of
bloodsucker
what
in
her
expert
opinion
are
the
worst
forms
of
electronic
crime
i
ask
consulting
my
notes
is
it
credit
card
fraud
breaking
into
atm
bank
machines
computer
intrusions
software
viruses
theft
records
tampering
software
piracy
pornographic
bulletin
boards
satellite

piracy
theft
of

it
a
long
list
by
the
time
i
reach
the
end
of
it
i
feel
rather
depressed
oh
no
says
gail
thackeray
leaning
forward
over
the
table
her
whole
body
gone
stiff
with
energetic
indignation
the
biggest
damage
is
telephone
fraud
fake
sweepstakes
fake
charities
con
operations
you
could
pay
off
the
national
debt
with
what
these
guys
steal
they
target
old

they
get
hold
of
credit
ratings
and
demographics
they
rip
off
the
old

the
weak

tumbling
out
of
her
it
stuff
your
everyday
fraud
grifters
conning
people
out
of
money
over

have
been
around
for
decades
this
is
where
the
word
phony
came
from
it
just
that
it
so
much
easier
now
horribly
facilitated
by
advances
in
technology
and
the
byzantine
structure
of
the
modern

system
the
same
professional
fraudsters
do
it
over
and
over
thackeray
tells
me
they
hide
behind
dense
of
fake
companies
fake
holding
corporations
nine
or
ten
layers
deep
registered
all
over
the
map
they
get
a

installed
under
a
false

in
an
empty
and
then
they
everything
out
of
that
phone
to
yet
another
phone
a
phone
that
may
even
be
in
another
state
and
they
do
even
pay
the
charges
on
their
phones
after
a
month
or
so
they
just
split

else

just

we
sitting
in

it
a
tough
town
phoenix
a
state
capital
seeing
some
hard
times
even
to
a
texan
like
myself
arizona
state
politics
seem
rather
baroque
there
was
and
remains
endless
trouble
over
the
martin
luther
king
holiday
the
sort
of
incident
for
which
arizona
politics
seem
famous
there
was
evan
mecham
the
eccentric
republican
millionaire
governor
who
was
impeached
after
reducing
state
government
to
a
ludicrous
shambles
then
there
was
the
national
keating
scandal
involving
arizona
savings
and
loans
in
which
both
of
senators
deconcini
and
mccain
played
sadly
prominent
roles
and
the
very
latest
is
the
bizarre
azscam
case
in
which
state
legislators
were
videotaped
eagerly
taking
cash
from
an
informant
of
the
phoenix
city
police
department
who
was
posing
as
a
vegas
mobster
oh
says
thackeray
cheerfully
these
people
are
amateurs
here
they
thought
they
were
finally
getting
to
play
with
the
big
boys
they
do
have
the
least
idea
how
to
take
a
bribe
it
not
institutional
corruption
it
not
like
back
in
philly
gail
thackeray
was
a
former
prosecutor
in
philadelphia
now
she
a
former
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
arizona
since
moving
to
arizona
in
she
had
worked
under
the
aegis
of
steve
twist
her
boss
in
the
attorney
general
office
steve
twist
wrote
arizona
pioneering
computer
crime
laws
and
naturally
took
an
interest
in
seeing
them
enforced
it
was
a
snug
niche
and
thackeray
organized
crime
and
racketeering
unit
won
a
national
reputation
for
ambition
and
technical
knowledgeability
until
the
latest
election
in
arizona
thackeray
boss
ran
for
the
top
job
and
lost
the
victor
the
new
attorney
general
apparently
went
to
some
pains
to
eliminate
the
bureaucratic
traces
of
his
rival
including
his
pet
group
thackeray
group
twelve
people
got
their
walking
papers
now
thackeray
painstakingly
assembled

sits
gathering
dust
somewhere
in

on
washington

her
books
her
painstakingly
garnered
back
issues
of
phreak
and
hacker
zines
all
bought
at
her
own
expense
are
piled
in
boxes
somewhere
the
state
of
arizona
is
simply
not
particularly
interested
in
electronic
racketeering
at
the
moment
at
the
moment
of
our
interview
gail
thackeray
officially
unemployed
is
working
out
of
the
county
sheriff
office
living
on
her
savings
and
prosecuting
several
cases
working
weeks
just
as
always
for
no
pay
at
all
i
trying
to
train
people
she
mutters
half
her
life
seems
to
be
spent
training
people
merely
pointing
out
to
the
naive
and
incredulous
such
as
myself
that
this
stuff
is
actually
going
on
out
there
it
a
small
world
computer
crime
a
young
world
gail
thackeray
a
trim
blonde
who
favors
grand
canyon
rafting
to
kill
some
slow
time
is
one
of
the
world
most
senior
most
veteran
her
mentor
was
donn
parker
the
california
theorist
who
got
it
all
started
back
in
the
the
grandfather
of
the
field
the
great
bald
eagle
of
computer
crime
and
what
she
has
learned
gail
thackeray
teaches
endlessly
tirelessly
to
anybody
to
secret
service
agents
and
state
police
at
the
glynco
georgia
federal
training
center
to
local
police
on
roadshows
with
her
slide
projector
and
notebook
to
corporate
security
personnel
to
journalists
to
parents
even
crooks
look
to
gail
thackeray
for
advice
call
her
at
the
office
they
know
very
well
who
she
is
they
pump
her
for
information
on
what
the
cops
are
up
to
how
much
they
know
sometimes
whole
crowds
of
phone
phreaks
hanging
out
on
illegal
conference
calls
will
call
gail
thackeray
up
they
taunt
her
and
as
always
they
boast
real
stone
simply
can
not
shut
up
they
natter
on
for
hours
left
to
themselves
they
mostly
talk
about
the
intricacies
of
phones
it
about
as
interesting
as
listening
to
talk
about
suspension
and
they
also
gossip
cruelly
about
each
other
and
when
talking
to
gail
thackeray
they
incriminate
themselves
i
have
tapes
thackeray
says
coolly
phone
phreaks
just
talk
like
crazy
out
in
alabama
has
been
known
to
spend
simply
reading
stolen
aloud
into
answering
machines
hundreds
thousands
of
numbers
recited
in
a
monotone
without
a
break
an
eerie
phenomenon
when
arrested
it
a
rare
phone
phreak
who
does
inform
at
endless
length
on
everybody
he
knows
hackers
are
no
better
what
other
group
of
criminals
she
asks
rhetorically
publishes
newsletters
and
holds
conventions
she
seems
deeply
nettled
by
the
sheer
brazenness
of
this
behavior
though
to
an
outsider
this
activity
might
make
one
wonder
whether
hackers
should
be
considered
criminals
at
all
skateboarders
have
magazines
and
they
trespass
a
lot
hot
rod
people
have
magazines
and
they
break
speed
limits
and
sometimes
kill
people
i
ask
her
whether
it
would
be
any
loss
to
society
if
phone
phreaking
and
computer
hacking
as
hobbies
simply
dried
up
and
blew
away
so
that
nobody
ever
did
it
again
she
seems
surprised
no
she
says
swiftly
maybe
a
little
in
the
old
days
mit
stuff
but
there
a
lot
of
wonderful
legal
stuff
you
can
do
with
computers
now
you
do
have
to
break
into
somebody
else
just
to
learn
you
do
have
that
excuse
you
can
learn
all
you
like
did
you
ever
hack
into
a
system
i
ask
the
trainees
do
it
at
glynco
just
to
demonstrate
system
vulnerabilities
she
cool
to
the
notion
genuinely
indifferent
what
kind
of
computer
do
you
have
a
compaq
she
mutters
what
kind
do
you
wish
you
had
at
this
question
the
unmistakable
light
of
true
hackerdom
flares
in
gail
thackeray
eyes
she
becomes
tense
animated
the
words
pour
out
an
amiga
with
an
ibm
card
and
mac
emulation
the
most
common
hacker
machines
are
amigas
and
commodores
and
apples
if
she
had
the
amiga
she
enthuses
she
could
run
a
whole
galaxy
of
seized
disks
on
one
convenient
multifunctional
machine
a
cheap
one
too
not
like
the
old
attorney
general
lab
where
they
had
an
ancient
machine
assorted
amiga
flavors
and
apple
flavors
a
couple
ibms
all
the
utility
software
no
commodores
the
workstations
down
at
the
attorney
general
are
wang
dedicated
lame
machines
tied
in
to
an
office
net
though
at
least
they
get
line
to
the
lexis
and
westlaw
legal
data
services
i
do
say
anything
i
recognize
the
syndrome
though
this
has
been
running
through
segments
of
our
society
for
years
now
it
a
strange
kind
of
lust
but
it
a
shared
disease
it
can
kill
parties
dead
as
conversation
spirals
into
the
deepest
and
most
deviant
recesses
of
software
releases
and
expensive
peripherals
the
mark
of
the
hacker
beast
i
have
it
too
the
whole
electronic
community
whatever
the
hell
that
is
has
it
gail
thackeray
has
it
gail
thackeray
is
a
hacker
cop
my
immediate
reaction
is
a
strong
rush
of
indignant
pity
why
does
somebody
buy
this
woman
her
amiga
it
not
like
she
asking
for
a
cray
supercomputer
mainframe
an
amiga
a
sweet
little
thing
we
losing
zillions
in
organized
fraud
prosecuting
and
defending
a
single
hacker
case
in
court
can
cost
a
hundred
grand
easy
how
come
nobody
can
come
up
with
four
lousy
grand
so
this
woman
can
do
her
job
for
a
hundred
grand
we
could
buy
every
computer
cop
in
america
an
amiga
there
are
that
many
of
computers
the
lust
the
hunger
for
computers
the
loyalty
they
inspire
the
intense
sense
of
possessiveness
the
culture
they
have
bred
i
myself
am
sitting
in
downtown
phoenix
arizona
because
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
the
police
might
just
might
come
and
take
away
my
computer
the
prospect
of
this
the
mere
implied
threat
was
unbearable
it
literally
changed
my
life

life
gail
thackeray
was
one
of
the
top
people
in
america
and
i
was
just
some
novelist
and
yet
i
had
a
better
computer
than
hers
practically
everybody
i
knew
had
a
better
computer
than
gail
thackeray
and
her
feeble
laptop
it
was
like
sending
the
sheriff
in
to
clean
up
dodge
city
and
arming
her
with
a
slingshot
cut
from
an
old
rubber
tire
but
then
again
you
do
need
a
howitzer
to
enforce
the
law
you
can
do
a
lot
just
with
a
badge
with
a
badge
alone
you
can
basically
wreak
havoc
take
a
terrible
vengeance
on
wrongdoers
ninety

look

it

send
reeling
back
in

it
be
like
it
is
now
only
worse
she
tells
me
with
perfect
conviction
still
there
in
the
background
ticking
along
changing
with
the
times
the
criminal
underworld
it
be
like
drugs
are
like
our
problems
with
alcohol
all
the
cops
and
laws
in
the
world
never
solved
our
problems
with
alcohol
if
there
something
people
want
a
certain
percentage
of
them
are
just
going
to
take
it
fifteen
percent
of
the
populace
will
never
steal
fifteen
percent
will
steal
most
anything
not
nailed
down
the
battle
is
for
the
hearts
and
minds
of
the
remaining
seventy
percent
and
criminals
catch
on
fast
if
there
not
too
steep
a
learning
curve
if
it
does
require
a
baffling
amount
of
expertise
and
practice
then
criminals
are
often
some
of
the
first
through
the
gate
of
a
new
technology
especially
if
it
helps
them
to
hide

have
tons
of

the
new

tech
like
pagers
cellular

faxes
federal

were
pioneered
by
rich
corporate
people
and
by
criminals
in
the
early
years
of
pagers
and
beepers
dope

were
so
enthralled
this
technology
that
owing

of
cocaine
dealing
cb
radio
exploded
when
the

limit
hit
and
breaking
the
highway
law
became
a
national
pastime
dope
dealers
send
cash
by
federal
express
despite
or
perhaps
because
of
the
warnings
in
fedex
offices
that
tell
you
never
to
try
this
fed
ex

and
dogs
on
their

to
stop

that
does
work
very
well
drug
dealers
went
wild
over

there

the

according
to
thackeray
the

a

they
do
deserve

basically
they

generally
the

drifted
into
the

the

lashed
out

so
the
phreaks
switched
to
smaller

today
they
are
moving
into
locally

which
are
full
of

holes
dreadfully
easy
to
hack
these

are
the

who
find
it
hard
to
protect

who
really
suffer
from
these

phone
phreaks
pick
on

they
do
it
for

if
it
were

they
would
do

they
do

they
want
the

plenty
of

around
if
you
willing

at

that
quite
a

of

a

and
is
dashing

jabbing
the

with
an

glee
phoenix
was
the
home
of
operation
sundevil
the
legion
of
doom
ran
a

bulletin
board
called
the
phoenix

an
australian
hacker
named
phoenix
once
burrowed
through
the
internet
to
attack
cliff
stoll
then
bragged
and
boasted
about
it
to
the
new
york
times
this
net
of
coincidence
is
both
odd
and
meaningless
the
headquarters
of
the
arizona
attorney
general
gail
former
workplace
is
on
washington
avenue
many
of
the
downtown
streets
in
phoenix
are
named
after
prominent
american
presidents
washington
jefferson
madison
after
dark
all
the
employees
go
home
to
their
suburbs
washington
jefferson
and
madison
what
would
be
the
phoenix
inner
city
if
there
were
an
inner
city
in
this
sprawling
town
become
the
haunts
of
transients
and
derelicts
the
homeless
the
sidewalks
along
washington
are
lined
with
orange
trees
ripe
fallen
fruit
lies
scattered
like
croquet
balls
on
the
sidewalks
and
gutters
no
one
seems
to
be
eating
them
i
try
a
fresh
one
it
tastes
unbearably
bitter
the
attorney
general
office
built
in
during
the
babbitt
administration
is
a
long
low
building
of
white
cement
and
sheets
of
behind
each
glass
wall
is
a
lawyer
office
quite
open
and
visible
to
anyone
strolling
by
across
the
street
is
a
dour
government
building
labelled
simply
economic
security
something
that
has
not
been
in
great
supply
in
the
american
southwest
lately
the
offices
are
about
twelve
feet
square
they
feature
tall
wooden
cases
full
of
lawbooks
wang
computer
monitors
telephones
notes
galore
also
framed
law
diplomas
and
a
general
excess
of
bad
western
landscape
art
ansel
adams
photos
are
a
big
favorite
perhaps
to
compensate
for
the
dismal
specter
of
the
parking
lot
two
acres
of
striped
black
asphalt
which
features
gravel
landscaping
and
some
barrel
cacti
it
has
grown
dark
gail
thackeray
has
told
me
that
the
people
who
work
late
here
are
afraid
of
muggings
in
the
parking
lot
it
seems
cruelly
ironic
that
a
woman
tracing
electronic
racketeers
across
the
interstate
labyrinth
of
cyberspace
should
fear
an
assault
by
a
homeless
derelict
in
the
parking
lot
of
her
own
workplace
perhaps
this
is
less
than
coincidence
perhaps
these
two
seemingly
disparate
worlds
are
somehow
generating
one
another
the
poor
and
disenfranchised
take
to
the
streets
while
the
rich
and
safe
in
their
bedrooms
chatter
over
their
modems
quite
often
the
derelicts
kick
the
glass
out
and
break
in
to
the
lawyers
offices
if
they
see
something
they
need
or
want
badly
enough
i
cross
the
parking
lot
to
the
street
behind
the
attorney
general
office
a
pair
of
young
tramps
are
bedding
down
on
flattened
sheets
of
cardboard
under
an
alcove
stretching
over
the
sidewalk
one
tramp
wears
a
reading
california
in
cursive
his
nose
and
cheeks
look
chafed
and
swollen
they
glisten
with
what
seems
to
be
vaseline
the
other
tramp
has
a
ragged
shirt
and
lank
brown
hair
parted
in
the
middle
they
both
wear
blue
jeans
coated
in
grime
they
are
both
drunk
you
guys
crash
here
a
lot
i
ask
them
they
look
at
me
warily
i
am
wearing
black
jeans
a
black
pinstriped
suit
jacket
and
a
black
silk
tie
i
have
odd
shoes
and
a
funny
haircut
it
our
first
time
here
says
the
tramp
unconvincingly
there
is
a
lot
of
cardboard
stacked
here
more
than
any
two
people
could
use
we
usually
stay
at
the
vinnie
down
the
street
says
the
tramp
puffing
a
marlboro
with
a
meditative
air
as
he
sprawls
with
his
head
on
a
blue
nylon
backpack
the
saint
vincent
you
know
who
works
in
that
building
over
there
i
ask
pointing
the
tramp
shrugs
some
kind
of
attorneys
it
says
we
urge
one
another
to
take
it
easy
i
give
them
five
bucks
a
block
down
the
street
i
meet
a
vigorous
workman
who
is
wheeling
along
some
kind
of
industrial
trolley
it
has
what
appears
to
be
a
tank
of
propane
on
it
we
make
eye
contact
we
nod
politely
i
walk
past
him
hey
excuse
me
sir
he
says
yes
i
say
stopping
and
turning
have
you
seen
the
guy
says
rapidly
a
black
guy
about
scars
on
both
his
cheeks
like
this
he
gestures
wears
a
black
baseball
cap
on
backwards
wandering
around
here
anyplace
sounds
like
i
do
much
want
to
meet
him
i
say
he
took
my
wallet
says
my
new
acquaintance
took
it
this
morning
some
people
would
be
scared
of
a
guy
like
that
but
i
not
scared
i
from
chicago
i
gon
na
hunt
him
down
we
do
things
like
that
in
chicago
yeah
i
went
to
the
cops
and
now
he
got
an
apb
out
on
his
ass
he
says
with
satisfaction
you
run
into
him
you
let
me
know
okay
i
say
what
is
your
name
sir
stanley
and
how
can
i
reach
you
oh
stanley
says
in
the
same
rapid
voice
you
do
have
to
reach
uh
me
you
can
just
call
the
cops
go
straight
to
the
cops
he
reaches
into
a
pocket
and
pulls
out
a
greasy
piece
of
pasteboard
see
here
my
report
on
him
i
look
the
report
the
size
of
an
index
card
is
labelled
phoenix
residents
opposing
active
crime
threat
or
is
it
organized
against
crime
threat
in
the
darkening
street
it
hard
to
read
some
kind
of
vigilante
group
neighborhood
watch
i
feel
very
puzzled
are
you
a
police
officer
sir
he
smiles
seems
very
pleased
by
the
question
no
he
says
but
you
are
a
resident
would
you
believe
a
homeless
person
stanley
says
really
but
what
with
the
for
the
first
time
i
take
a
close
look
at
stanley
trolley
it
a
thing
of
industrial
metal
but
the
device
i
had
mistaken
for
a
tank
of
propane
is
in
fact
a
stanley
also
has
an
army
stuffed
tight
as
a
sausage
with
clothing
or
perhaps
a
tent
and
at
the
base
of
his
trolley
a
cardboard
box
and
a
battered
leather
briefcase
i
see
i
say
quite
at
a
loss
for
the
first
time
i
notice
that
stanley
has
a
wallet
he
has
not
lost
his
wallet
at
all
it
is
in
his
back
pocket
and
chained
to
his
belt
it
not
a
new
wallet
it
seems
to
have
seen
a
lot
of
wear
well
you
know
how
it
is
brother
says
stanley
now
that
i
know
that
he
is
homeless
a
possible
threat
my
entire
perception
of
him
has
changed
in
an
instant
his
speech
which
once
seemed
just
bright
and
enthusiastic
now
seems
to
have
a
dangerous
tang
of
mania
i
have
to
do
this
he
assures
me
track
this
guy
down
it
a
thing
i
do
you
know
keep
myself
together
he
smiles
nods
lifts
his
trolley
by
its
decaying
rubber
handgrips
got
ta
work
together
stanley
booms
his
face
alight
with
cheerfulness
the
police
ca
do
everything
the
gentlemen
i
met
in
my
stroll
in
downtown
phoenix
are
the
only
computer
illiterates
in
this
book
to
regard
them
as
irrelevant
however
would
be
a
grave
mistake
as
computerization
spreads
across
society
the
populace
at
large
is
subjected
to
wave
after
wave
of
future
shock
but
as
a
necessary
converse
the
computer
community
itself
is
subjected
to
wave
after
wave
of
incoming
computer
illiterates
how
will
those
currently
enjoying
america
digital
bounty
regard
and
treat
all
this
teeming
refuse
yearning
to
breathe
free
will
the
electronic
frontier
be
another
land
of
opportunity
or
an
armed
and
monitored
enclave
where
the
disenfranchised
snuggle
on
their
cardboard
at
the
locked
doors
of
our
houses
of
justice
some
people
just
do
get
along
with
computers
they
ca
read
they
ca
type
they
just
do
have
it
in
their
heads
to
master
arcane
instructions
in
wirebound
manuals
somewhere
the
process
of
computerization
of
the
populace
will
reach
a
limit
some
people
quite
decent
people
maybe
who
might
have
thrived
in
any
other
situation
will
be
left
irretrievably
outside
the
bounds
what
to
be
done
with
these
people
in
the
bright
new
shiny
electroworld
how
will
they
be
regarded
by
the
masters
of
cyberspace
with
contempt
indifference
fear
in
retrospect
it
astonishes
me
to
realize
how
quickly
poor
stanley
became
a
perceived
threat
surprise
and
fear
are
closely
allied
feelings
and
the
world
of
computing
is
full
of
surprises
i
met
one
character
in
the
streets
of
phoenix
whose
role
in
this
book
is
supremely
and
directly
relevant
that
personage
was
stanley
giant
thieving
scarred
phantom
this
phantasm
is
everywhere
in
this
book
he
is
the
specter
haunting
cyberspace
sometimes
he
a
maniac
vandal
ready
to
smash
the
phone
system
for
no
sane
reason
at
all
sometimes
he
a
fascist
fed
coldly
programming
his
mighty
mainframes
to
destroy
our
bill
of
rights
sometimes
he
a
telco
bureaucrat
covertly
conspiring
to
register
all
modems
in
the
service
of
an
orwellian
surveillance
regime
mostly
though
this
fearsome
phantom
is
a
hacker
he
strange
he
does
belong
he
not
authorized
he
does
smell
right
he
not
keeping
his
proper
place
he
not
one
of
us
the
focus
of
fear
is
the
hacker
for
much
the
same
reasons
that
stanley
fancied
assailant
is
black
stanley
demon
ca
go
away
because
he
does
exist
despite
singleminded
and
tremendous
effort
he
ca
be
arrested
sued
jailed
or
fired
the
only
constructive
way
to
do
anything
about
him
is
to
learn
more
about
stanley
himself
this
learning
process
may
be
repellent
it
may
be
ugly
it
may
involve
grave
elements
of
paranoiac
confusion
but
it
necessary
knowing
stanley
requires
something
more
than
condescension
it
requires
more
than
steely
legal
objectivity
it
requires
human
compassion
and
sympathy
to
know
stanley
is
to
know
his
demon
if
you
know
the
other
guy
demon
then
maybe
you
come
to
know
some
of
your
own
you
be
able
to
separate
reality
from
illusion
and
then
you
wo
do
your
cause
and
yourself
more
harm
than
good
like
poor
damned
stanley
from
chicago
did
the
federal
computer
investigations
committee
fcic
is
the
most
important
and
influential
organization
in
the
realm
of
american
since
the
police
of
other
countries
have
largely
taken
their
cues
from
american
methods
the
fcic
might
well
be
called
the
most
important
computer
crime
group
in
the
world
it
is
also
by
federal
standards
an
organization
of
great
unorthodoxy
state
and
local
investigators
mix
with
federal
agents
lawyers
financial
auditors
and
programmers
trade
notes
with
street
cops
industry
vendors
and
telco
security
people
show
up
to
explain
their
gadgetry
and
plead
for
protection
and
justice
private
investigators
experts
and
industry
pundits
throw
in
their
two
cents
worth
the
fcic
is
the
antithesis
of
a
formal
bureaucracy
members
of
the
fcic
are
obscurely
proud
of
this
fact
they
recognize
their
group
as
aberrant
but
are
entirely
convinced
that
this
for
them
outright
weird
behavior
is
nevertheless
absolutely
necessary
to
get
their
jobs
done
fcic
regulars
from
the
secret
service
the
fbi
the
irs
the
department
of
labor
the
offices
of
federal
attorneys
state
police
the
air
force
from
military
intelligence
often
attend
meetings
held
hither
and
thither
across
the
country
at
their
own
expense
the
fcic
does
get
grants
it
charge
membership
fees
it
does
have
a
boss
it
has
no
headquarters
just
a
mail
drop
in
washington
dc
at
the
fraud
division
of
the
secret
service
it
does
have
a
budget
it
does
have
schedules
it
meets
three
times
a
year
sort
of
sometimes
it
issues
publications
but
the
fcic
has
no
regular
publisher
no
treasurer
not
even
a
secretary
there
are
no
minutes
of
fcic
meetings
people
are
considered
members
but
there
not
much
in
the
way
of
elections
there
are
no
badges
lapel
pins
or
certificates
of
membership
everyone
is
on
a
basis
there
are
about
forty
of
them
nobody
knows
how
many
exactly
people
come
people
go
sometimes
people
go
formally
but
still
hang
around
anyway
nobody
has
ever
exactly
figured
out
what
membership
of
this
committee
actually
entails
strange
as
this
may
seem
to
some
to
anyone
familiar
with
the
social
world
of
computing
the
organization
of
the
fcic
is
very
recognizable
for
years
now
economists
and
management
theorists
have
speculated
that
the
tidal
wave
of
the
information
revolution
would
destroy
rigid
pyramidal
bureaucracies
where
everything
is
and
centrally
controlled
highly
trained
employees
would
take
on
much
greater
autonomy
being
and
moving
from
place
to
place
task
to
task
with
great
speed
and
fluidity
would
rule
with
groups
of
people
spontaneously
knitting
together
across
organizational
lines
tackling
the
problem
at
hand
applying
intense
expertise
to
it
and
then
vanishing
whence
they
came
this
is
more
or
less
what
has
actually
happened
in
the
world
of
federal
computer
investigation
with
the
conspicuous
exception
of
the
phone
companies
which
are
after
all
over
a
hundred
years
old
practically
every
organization
that
plays
any
important
role
in
this
book
functions
just
like
the
fcic
the
chicago
task
force
the
arizona
racketeering
unit
the
legion
of
doom
the
phrack
crowd
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
they
all
look
and
act
like
tiger
teams
or
user
groups
they
are
all
electronic
leaping
up
spontaneously
to
attempt
to
meet
a
need
some
are
police
some
are
by
strict
definition
criminals
some
are
political
but
every
single
group
has
that
same
quality
of
apparent
spontaneity
hey
gang
my
uncle
got
a
barn
let
put
on
a
show
every
one
of
these
groups
is
embarrassed
by
this
amateurism
and
for
the
sake
of
their
public
image
in
a
world
of
people
they
all
attempt
to
look
as
stern
and
formal
and
impressive
as
possible
these
electronic
resemble
groups
of
pioneers
hankering
after
the
respectability
of
statehood
there
are
however
two
crucial
differences
in
the
historical
experience
of
these
pioneers
of
the
nineteeth
and
centuries
first
powerful
information
technology
does
play
into
the
hands
of
small
fluid
loosely
organized
groups
there
have
always
been
pioneers
hobbyists
amateurs
dilettantes
volunteers
movements
users
groups
and
panels
of
experts
around
but
a
group
of
this
kind
when
technically
equipped
to
ship
huge
amounts
of
specialized
information
at
lightning
speed
to
its
members
to
government
and
to
the
press
is
simply
a
different
kind
of
animal
it
like
the
difference
between
an
eel
and
an
electric
eel
the
second
crucial
change
is
that
american
society
is
currently
in
a
state
approaching
permanent
technological
revolution
in
the
world
of
computers
particularly
it
is
practically
impossible
to
ever
stop
being
a
pioneer
unless
you
either
drop
dead
or
deliberately
jump
off
the
bus
the
scene
has
never
slowed
down
enough
to
become
and
after
twenty
thirty
forty
years
the
computer
revolution
continues
to
spread
to
permeate
new
corners
of
society
anything
that
really
works
is
already
obsolete
if
you
spend
your
entire
working
life
as
a
pioneer
the
word
pioneer
begins
to
lose
its
meaning
your
way
of
life
looks
less
and
less
like
an
introduction
to
something
else
more
stable
and
organized
and
more
and
more
like
just
the
way
things
are
a
permanent
revolution
is
really
a
contradiction
in
terms
if
turmoil
lasts
long
enough
it
simply
becomes
a
new
kind
of
society
still
the
same
game
of
history
but
new
players
new
rules
apply
this
to
the
world
of
late
law
enforcement
and
the
implications
are
novel
and
puzzling
indeed
any
bureaucratic
rulebook
you
write
about
will
be
flawed
when
you
write
it
and
almost
an
antique
by
the
time
it
sees
print
the
fluidity
and
fast
reactions
of
the
fcic
give
them
a
great
advantage
in
this
regard
which
explains
their
success
even
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
which
it
does
not
in
fact
possess
it
is
impossible
for
an
organization
the
size
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
get
up
to
speed
on
the
theory
and
practice
of
computer
crime
if
they
tried
to
train
all
their
agents
to
do
this
it
would
be
suicidal
as
they
would
never
be
able
to
do
anything
else
the
fbi
does
try
to
train
its
agents
in
the
basics
of
electronic
crime
at
their
base
in
quantico
virginia
and
the
secret
service
along
with
many
other
law
enforcement
groups
runs
quite
successful
and
training
courses
on
wire
fraud
business
crime
and
computer
intrusion
at
the
federal
law
enforcement
training
center
fletc
pronounced
fletsy
in
glynco
georgia
but
the
best
efforts
of
these
bureaucracies
does
not
remove
the
absolute
need
for
a
mess
like
the
fcic
for
you
see
the
members
of
fcic
are
the
trainers
of
the
rest
of
law
enforcement
practically
and
literally
speaking
they
are
the
glynco
faculty
by
another
name
if
the
fcic
went
over
a
cliff
on
a
bus
the
law
enforcement
community
would
be
rendered
deaf
dumb
and
blind
in
the
world
of
computer
crime
and
would
swiftly
feel
a
desperate
need
to
reinvent
them
and
this
is
no
time
to
go
starting
from
scratch
on
june
i
once
again
arrived
in
phoenix
arizona
for
the
latest
meeting
of
the
federal
computer
investigations
committee
this
was
more
or
less
the
twentieth
meeting
of
this
stellar
group
the
count
was
uncertain
since
nobody
could
figure
out
whether
to
include
the
meetings
of
the
colluquy
which
is
what
the
fcic
was
called
in
the
before
it
had
even
managed
to
obtain
the
dignity
of
its
own
acronym
since
my
last
visit
to
arizona
in
may
the
local
azscam
bribery
scandal
had
resolved
itself
in
a
general
muddle
of
humiliation
the
phoenix
chief
of
police
whose
agents
had
videotaped
nine
state
legislators
up
to
no
good
had
resigned
his
office
in
a
tussle
with
the
phoenix
city
council
over
the
propriety
of
his
undercover
operations
the
phoenix
chief
could
now
join
gail
thackeray
and
eleven
of
her
closest
associates
in
the
shared
experience
of
politically
motivated
unemployment
as
of
june
resignations
were
still
continuing
at
the
arizona
attorney
general
office
which
could
be
interpreted
as
either
a
new
broom
sweeping
clean
or
a
night
of
the
long
knives
part
ii
depending
on
your
point
of
view
the
meeting
of
fcic
was
held
at
the
scottsdale
hilton
resort
scottsdale
is
a
wealthy
suburb
of
phoenix
known
as
scottsdull
to
scoffing
local
trendies
but
with
posh
and
manicured
lawns
while
conspicuously
undersupplied
with
homeless
derelicts
the
scottsdale
hilton
resort
was
a
sprawling
hotel
in
postmodern
style
it
featured
a
mission
bell
tower
plated
in
turquoise
tile
and
vaguely
resembling
a
saudi
minaret
inside
it
was
all
barbarically
striped
santa
fe
style
decor
there
was
a
health
spa
downstairs
and
a
large
pool
in
the
patio
a
poolside
offered
ben
and
politically
correct
peace
pops
i
registered
as
a
member
of
fcic
attaining
a
handy
discount
rate
then
went
in
search
of
the
feds
sure
enough
at
the
back
of
the
hotel
grounds
came
the
unmistakable
sound
of
gail
thackeray
holding
forth
since
i
had
also
attended
the
computers
freedom
and
privacy
conference
about
which
more
later
this
was
the
second
time
i
had
seen
thackeray
in
a
group
of
her
law
enforcement
colleagues
once
again
i
was
struck
by
how
simply
pleased
they
seemed
to
see
her
it
was
natural
that
get
some
attention
as
gail
was
one
of
two
women
in
a
group
of
some
thirty
men
but
there
was
a
lot
more
to
it
than
that
gail
thackeray
personifies
the
social
glue
of
the
fcic
they
could
give
a
damn
about
her
losing
her
job
with
the
attorney
general
they
were
sorry
about
it
of
course
but
hell
they
all
lost
jobs
if
they
were
the
kind
of
guys
who
liked
steady
boring
jobs
they
would
never
have
gotten
into
computer
work
in
the
first
place
i
wandered
into
her
circle
and
was
immediately
introduced
to
five
strangers
the
conditions
of
my
visit
at
fcic
were
reviewed
i
would
not
quote
anyone
directly
i
would
not
tie
opinions
expressed
to
the
agencies
of
the
attendees
i
would
not
a
purely
hypothetical
example
report
the
conversation
of
a
guy
from
the
secret
service
talking
quite
civilly
to
a
guy
from
the
fbi
as
these
two
agencies
never
talk
to
each
other
and
the
irs
also
present
also
hypothetical
never
talks
to
anybody
worse
yet
i
was
forbidden
to
attend
the
first
conference
and
i
did
i
have
no
idea
what
the
fcic
was
up
to
behind
closed
doors
that
afternoon
i
rather
suspect
that
they
were
engaging
in
a
frank
and
thorough
confession
of
their
errors
and
blunders
as
this
has
been
a
feature
of
every
fcic
meeting
since
their
legendary
memphis
of
perhaps
the
single
greatest
attraction
of
fcic
is
that
it
is
a
place
where
you
can
go
let
your
hair
down
and
completely
level
with
people
who
actually
comprehend
what
you
are
talking
about
not
only
do
they
understand
you
but
they
really
pay
attention
they
are
grateful
for
your
insights
and
they
forgive
you
which
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
is
something
even
your
boss
ca
do
because
as
soon
as
you
start
talking
rom
bbs
or
trunk
his
eyes
glaze
over
i
had
nothing
much
to
do
that
afternoon
the
fcic
were
beavering
away
in
their
conference
room
doors
were
firmly
closed
windows
too
dark
to
peer
through
i
wondered
what
a
real
hacker
a
computer
intruder
would
do
at
a
meeting
like
this
the
answer
came
at
once
he
would
trash
the
place
not
reduce
the
place
to
trash
in
some
orgy
of
vandalism
that
not
the
use
of
the
term
in
the
hacker
milieu
no
he
would
quietly
empty
the
trash
baskets
and
silently
raid
any
valuable
data
indiscreetly
thrown
away
journalists
have
been
known
to
do
this
journalists
hunting
information
have
been
known
to
do
almost
every
single
unethical
thing
that
hackers
have
ever
done
they
also
throw
in
a
few
awful
techniques
all
their
own
the
legality
of
is
somewhat
dubious
but
it
is
not
in
fact
flagrantly
illegal
it
was
however
absurd
to
contemplate
trashing
the
fcic
these
people
knew
all
about
trashing
i
would
last
fifteen
seconds
the
idea
sounded
interesting
though
i
been
hearing
a
lot
about
the
practice
lately
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
decided
i
would
try
trashing
the
office
across
the
hall
from
the
fcic
an
area
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
investigators
the
office
was
tiny
six
chairs
a
table
nevertheless
it
was
open
so
i
dug
around
in
its
plastic
trash
can
to
my
utter
astonishment
i
came
up
with
the
torn
scraps
of
a
sprint
phone
bill
more
digging
produced
a
bank
statement
and
the
scraps
of
a
letter
along
with
gum
cigarette
ashes
candy
wrappers
and
a
of
usa
today
the
trash
went
back
in
its
receptacle
while
the
scraps
of
data
went
into
my
travel
bag
i
detoured
through
the
hotel
souvenir
shop
for
some
scotch
tape
and
went
up
to
my
room
coincidence
or
not
it
was
quite
true
some
poor
soul
had
in
fact
thrown
a
sprint
bill
into
the
hotel
trash
date
may
total
amount
due
not
a
business
phone
either
but
a
residential
bill
in
the
name
of
someone
called
evelyn
not
her
real
name
evelyn
records
showed
a
past
due
bill
here
was
her
account
id
here
was
a
stern
warning
treat
your
foncard
as
you
would
any
credit
card
to
secure
against
fraud
never
give
your
foncard
number
over
the
phone
unless
you
initiated
the
call
if
you
receive
suspicious
calls
please
notify
customer
service
immediately
i
examined
my
watch
still
plenty
of
time
left
for
the
fcic
to
carry
on
i
sorted
out
the
scraps
of
evelyn
sprint
bill
and
them
with
fresh
scotch
tape
here
was
her
foncard
number
did
seem
to
have
the
id
number
necessary
to
cause
real
fraud
trouble
i
did
however
have
evelyn
home
phone
number
and
the
phone
numbers
for
a
whole
crowd
of
evelyn
friends
and
acquaintances
in
san
diego
folsom
redondo
las
vegas
la
jolla
topeka
and
northampton
massachusetts
even
somebody
in
australia
i
examined
other
documents
here
was
a
bank
statement
it
was
ira
account
down
at
a
bank
in
san
mateo
california
total
balance
here
was
a
bill
for
she
was
paying
it
off
bit
by
bit
driven
by
motives
that
were
completely
unethical
and
prurient
i
now
examined
the
handwritten
notes
they
had
been
torn
fairly
thoroughly
so
much
so
that
it
took
me
almost
an
entire
five
minutes
to
reassemble
them
they
were
drafts
of
a
love
letter
they
had
been
written
on
the
lined
stationery
of
evelyn
employer
a
biomedical
company
probably
written
at
work
when
she
should
have
been
doing
something
else
dear
bob
not
his
real
name
i
guess
in
everyone
life
there
comes
a
time
when
hard
decisions
have
to
be
made
and
this
is
a
difficult
one
for
me
very
upsetting
since
you
have
called
me
and
i
do
understand
why
i
can
only
surmise
it
because
you
do
want
to
i
thought
i
would
have
heard
from
you
friday
i
did
have
a
few
unusual
problems
with
my
phone
and
possibly
you
tried
i
hope
so
robert
you
asked
me
to
go
the
first
note
ended
unusual
problems
with
her
phone
i
looked
swiftly
at
the
next
note
bob
not
hearing
from
you
for
the
whole
weekend
has
left
me
very
perplexed
next
draft
dear
bob
there
is
so
much
i
do
understand
right
now
and
i
wish
i
did
i
wish
i
could
talk
to
you
but
for
some
unknown
reason
you
have
elected
not
to
call
this
is
so
difficult
for
me
to
understand
she
tried
again
bob
since
i
have
always
held
you
in
such
high
esteem
i
had
every
hope
that
we
could
remain
good
friends
but
now
one
essential
ingredient
is
missing
respect
your
ability
to
discard
people
when
their
purpose
is
served
is
appalling
to
me
the
kindest
thing
you
could
do
for
me
now
is
to
leave
me
alone
you
are
no
longer
welcome
in
my
heart
or
home
try
again
bob
i
wrote
a
very
factual
note
to
you
to
say
how
much
respect
i
had
lost
for
you
by
the
way
you
treat
people
me
in
particular
so
uncaring
and
cold
the
kindest
thing
you
can
do
for
me
is
to
leave
me
alone
entirely
as
you
are
no
longer
welcome
in
my
heart
or
home
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
could
retire
your
debt
to
me
as
soon
as
possible
i
wish
no
link
to
you
in
any
way
sincerely
evelyn
good
heavens
i
thought
the
bastard
actually
owes
her
money
i
turned
to
the
next
page
bob
very
simple
goodbye
no
more
mind
games
no
more
fascination
no
more
coldness
no
more
respect
for
you
it
over
finis
evie
there
were
two
versions
of
the
final
brushoff
letter
but
they
read
about
the
same
maybe
she
had
sent
it
the
final
item
in
my
illicit
and
shameful
booty
was
an
envelope
addressed
to
bob
at
his
home
address
but
it
had
no
stamp
on
it
and
it
had
been
mailed
maybe
she
just
been
blowing
off
steam
because
her
rascal
boyfriend
had
neglected
to
call
her
one
weekend
big
deal
maybe
they
kissed
and
made
up
maybe
she
and
bob
were
down
at
pop
chocolate
shop
now
sharing
a
malted
sure
easy
to
find
out
all
i
had
to
do
was
call
evelyn
up
with
a
story
and
enough
gall
i
could
probably
trick
the
truth
out
of
her
and
hackers
deceive
people
over
the
phone
all
the
time
it
called
social
engineering
social
engineering
is
a
very
common
practice
in
the
underground
and
almost
magically
effective
human
beings
are
almost
always
the
weakest
link
in
computer
security
the
simplest
way
to
learn
things
you
are
not
meant
to
know
is
simply
to
call
up
and
exploit
the
knowledgeable
people
with
social
engineering
you
use
the
bits
of
specialized
knowledge
you
already
have
as
a
key
to
manipulate
people
into
believing
that
you
are
legitimate
you
can
then
coax
flatter
or
frighten
them
into
revealing
almost
anything
you
want
to
know
deceiving
people
especially
over
the
phone
is
easy
and
fun
exploiting
their
gullibility
is
very
gratifying
it
makes
you
feel
very
superior
to
them
if
i
been
a
malicious
hacker
on
a
trashing
raid
i
would
now
have
evelyn
very
much
in
my
power
given
all
this
inside
data
it
would
take
much
effort
at
all
to
invent
a
convincing
lie
if
i
were
ruthless
enough
and
jaded
enough
and
clever
enough
this
momentary
indiscretion
of
hers
maybe
committed
in
tears
who
knows
could
cause
her
a
whole
world
of
confusion
and
grief
i
did
even
have
to
have
a
malicious
motive
maybe
i
be
on
her
side
and
call
up
bob
instead
and
anonymously
threaten
to
break
both
his
kneecaps
if
he
did
take
evelyn
out
for
a
steak
dinner
pronto
it
was
still
profoundly
none
of
my
business
to
have
gotten
this
knowledge
at
all
was
a
sordid
act
and
to
use
it
would
be
to
inflict
a
sordid
injury
to
do
all
these
awful
things
would
require
exactly
zero
expertise
all
it
would
take
was
the
willingness
to
do
it
and
a
certain
amount
of
bent
imagination
i
went
back
downstairs
the
fcic
who
had
labored
minutes
over
their
schedule
were
through
for
the
day
and
adjourned
to
the
hotel
bar
we
all
had
a
beer
i
had
a
chat
with
a
guy
about
isis
or
rather
iacis
the
international
association
of
computer
investigation
specialists
they
into
computer
forensics
the
techniques
of
picking
systems
apart
without
destroying
vital
evidence
iacis
currently
run
out
of
oregon
is
comprised
of
investigators
in
the
canada
taiwan
and
ireland
taiwan
and
ireland
i
said
are
taiwan
and
ireland
really
in
the
forefront
of
this
stuff
well
not
exactly
my
informant
admitted
they
just
happen
to
have
been
the
first
ones
to
have
caught
on
by
word
of
mouth
still
the
international
angle
counts
because
this
is
obviously
an
international
problem
go
everywhere
there
was
a
mountie
here
from
the
royal
canadian
mounted
police
he
seemed
to
be
having
quite
a
good
time
nobody
had
flung
this
canadian
out
because
he
might
pose
a
foreign
security
risk
these
are
cyberspace
cops
they
still
worry
a
lot
about
jurisdictions
but
mere
geography
is
the
least
of
their
troubles
nasa
had
failed
to
show
nasa
suffers
a
lot
from
computer
intrusions
in
particular
from
australian
raiders
and
a
chaos
computer
club
case
and
in
there
was
a
brief
press
flurry
when
it
was
revealed
that
one
of
nasa
houston
had
been
systematically
ripped
off
by
a
gang
of
but
the
nasa
guys
had
had
their
funding
cut
they
were
stripping
everything
air
force
osi
its
office
of
special
investigations
is
the
only
federal
entity
dedicated
to
computer
security
they
been
expected
to
show
up
in
force
but
some
of
them
had
cancelled
a
pentagon
budget
pinch
as
the
empties
piled
up
the
guys
began
joshing
around
and
telling
these
are
cops
thackeray
said
tolerantly
if
they
not
talking
shop
they
talk
about
women
and
beer
i
heard
the
story
about
the
guy
who
asked
for
a
copy
of
a
computer
disk
photocopied
the
label
on
it
he
put
the
floppy
disk
onto
the
glass
plate
of
a
photocopier
the
blast
of
static
when
the
copier
worked
completely
erased
all
the
real
information
on
the
disk
some
other
poor
souls
threw
a
whole
bag
of
confiscated
diskettes
into
the
trunk
next
to
the
police
radio
the
powerful
radio
signal
blasted
them
too
we
heard
a
bit
about
dave
geneson
the
first
computer
prosecutor
a
in
dade
county
turned
lawyer
dave
geneson
was
one
guy
who
had
hit
the
ground
running
a
signal
virtue
in
making
the
transition
to
it
was
generally
agreed
that
it
was
easier
to
learn
the
world
of
computers
first
then
police
or
prosecutorial
work
you
could
take
certain
computer
people
and
train
to
successful
police
work
but
of
course
they
had
to
have
the
cop
mentality
they
had
to
have
street
smarts
patience
persistence
and
discretion
you
got
to
make
sure
they
not
cowboys
most
of
the
folks
in
the
bar
had
backgrounds
in
military
intelligence
or
drugs
or
homicide
it
was
rudely
opined
that
military
intelligence
was
a
contradiction
in
terms
while
even
the
grisly
world
of
homicide
was
considered
cleaner
than
drug
enforcement
one
guy
had
been
undercover
doing
in
europe
for
four
years
straight
i
almost
recovered
now
he
said
deadpan
with
the
acid
black
humor
that
is
pure
cop
hey
now
i
can
say
fucker
without
putting
mother
in
front
of
it
in
the
cop
world
another
guy
said
earnestly
everything
is
good
and
bad
black
and
white
in
the
computer
world
everything
is
gray
one
guy
a
founder
of
the
fcic
who
been
with
the
group
since
it
was
just
the
colluquy
described
his
own
introduction
to
the
field
he
been
a
washington
dc
homicide
guy
called
in
on
a
hacker
case
from
the
word
hacker
he
naturally
assumed
he
was
on
the
trail
of
a
marauder
and
went
to
the
computer
center
expecting
blood
and
a
body
when
he
finally
figured
out
what
was
happening
there
after
loudly
demanding
in
vain
that
the
programmers
speak
english
he
called
headquarters
and
told
them
he
was
clueless
about
computers
they
told
him
nobody
else
knew
diddly
either
and
to
get
the
hell
back
to
work
so
he
said
he
had
proceeded
by
comparisons
by
analogy
by
metaphor
somebody
broke
in
to
your
computer
huh
breaking
and
entering
i
can
understand
that
how
he
get
in
over
the
harassing
i
can
understand
that
what
we
need
here
is
a
tap
and
a
trace
it
worked
it
was
better
than
nothing
and
it
worked
a
lot
faster
when
he
got
hold
of
another
cop
who
done
something
similar
and
then
the
two
of
them
got
another
and
another
and
pretty
soon
the
colluquy
was
a
happening
thing
it
helped
a
lot
that
everybody
seemed
to
know
carlton
fitzpatrick
the
trainer
in
glynco
the
ice
broke
in
memphis
in
the
colluquy
had
attracted
a
bunch
of
new
guys
secret
service
fbi
military
other
feds
heavy
guys
nobody
wanted
to
tell
anybody
anything
they
suspected
that
if
word
got
back
to
the
home
office
they
all
be
fired
they
passed
an
uncomfortably
guarded
afternoon
the
formalities
got
them
nowhere
but
after
the
formal
session
was
over
the
organizers
brought
in
a
case
of
beer
as
soon
as
the
participants
knocked
it
off
with
the
bureaucratic
ranks
and
everything
changed
i
bared
my
soul
one
veteran
reminisced
proudly
by
nightfall
they
were
building
pyramids
of
empty
and
doing
everything
but
composing
a
team
fight
song
fcic
were
not
the
only
people
around
there
was
datta
district
attorneys
technology
theft
association
though
they
mostly
specialized
in
chip
theft
intellectual
property
and
cases
there
was
htcia
high
tech
computer
investigators
association
also
out
in
silicon
valley
a
year
older
than
fcic
and
featuring
brilliant
people
like
donald
ingraham
there
was
leetac
law
enforcement
electronic
technology
assistance
committee
in
florida
and
units
in
illinois
and
maryland
and
texas
and
ohio
and
colorado
and
pennsylvania
but
these
were
local
groups
fcic
were
the
first
to
really
network
nationally
and
on
a
federal
level
fcic
people
live
on
the
phone
lines
not
on
bulletin
board
systems
they
know
very
well
what
boards
are
and
they
know
that
boards
are
secure
everyone
in
the
fcic
has
a
bill
like
you
would
believe
fcic
people
have
been
tight
with
the
telco
people
for
a
long
time
telephone
cyberspace
is
their
native
habitat
fcic
has
three
basic
the
trainers
the
security
people
and
the
investigators
that
why
it
called
an
investigations
committee
with
no
mention
of
the
term
the
dreaded
fcic
officially
is
an
association
of
agencies
rather
than
individuals
unofficially
this
field
is
small
enough
that
the
influence
of
individuals
and
individual
expertise
is
paramount
attendance
is
by
invitation
only
and
most
everyone
in
fcic
considers
himself
a
prophet
without
honor
in
his
own
house
again
and
again
i
heard
this
with
different
terms
but
identical
sentiments
i
been
sitting
in
the
wilderness
talking
to
myself
i
was
totally
isolated
i
was
desperate
fcic
is
the
best
thing
there
is
about
computer
crime
in
america
fcic
is
what
really
works
this
is
where
you
hear
real
people
telling
you
what
really
happening
out
there
not
just
lawyers
picking
nits
we
taught
each
other
everything
we
knew
the
sincerity
of
these
statements
convinces
me
that
this
is
true
fcic
is
the
real
thing
and
it
is
invaluable
it
also
very
sharply
at
odds
with
the
rest
of
the
traditions
and
power
structure
in
american
law
enforcement
there
probably
has
been
anything
around
as
loose
and
as
the
fcic
since
the
start
of
the
secret
service
in
the
fcic
people
are
living
like
people
in
a
environment
and
while
there
a
great
deal
to
be
said
for
that
there
also
a
great
deal
to
be
said
against
it
and
those
against
it
happen
to
control
the
budgets
i
listened
to
two
fcic
guys
from
jersey
compare
life
histories
one
of
them
had
been
a
biker
in
a
fairly
gang
in
the
oh
did
you
know
said
the
other
guy
from
jersey
big
guy
heavyset
yeah
i
knew
him
yeah
he
was
one
of
ours
he
was
our
plant
in
the
gang
really
wow
yeah
i
knew
him
helluva
guy
thackeray
reminisced
at
length
about
being
blind
in
the
november
antiwar
protests
in
washington
circle
covering
them
for
her
college
paper
oh
yeah
i
was
there
said
another
cop
glad
to
hear
that
tear
gas
hit
somethin
haw
haw
haw
he
been
so
blind
himself
he
confessed
that
later
that
day
he
arrested
a
small
tree
fcic
are
an
odd
group
sifted
out
by
coincidence
and
necessity
and
turned
into
a
new
kind
of
cop
there
are
a
lot
of
specialized
cops
in
the
world
your
bunco
guys
your
drug
guys
your
tax
guys
but
the
only
group
that
matches
fcic
for
sheer
isolation
are
probably
the
people
because
they
both
deal
with
conspirators
who
are
desperate
to
exchange
forbidden
data
and
also
desperate
to
hide
and
because
nobody
else
in
law
enforcement
even
wants
to
hear
about
it
fcic
people
tend
to
change
jobs
a
lot
they
tend
not
to
get
the
equipment
and
training
they
want
and
need
and
they
tend
to
get
sued
quite
often
as
the
night
wore
on
and
a
band
set
up
in
the
bar
the
talk
grew
darker
nothing
ever
gets
done
in
government
someone
opined
until
a
disaster
computing
disasters
are
awful
but
there
no
denying
that
they
greatly
help
the
credibility
of
fcic
people
the
internet
worm
for
instance
for
years
we
been
warning
about
that
but
it
nothing
compared
to
what
coming
they
expect
horrors
these
people
they
know
that
nothing
will
really
get
done
until
there
is
a
horror
next
day
we
heard
an
extensive
briefing
from
a
guy
who
been
a
computer
cop
gotten
into
hot
water
with
an
arizona
city
council
and
now
installed
computer
networks
for
a
living
at
a
considerable
rise
in
pay
he
talked
about
pulling
networks
apart
even
a
single
computer
with
enough
peripherals
is
a
literal
network
a
bunch
of
machines
all
cabled
together
generally
with
a
complexity
that
puts
stereo
units
to
shame
fcic
people
invent
and
publicize
methods
of
seizing
computers
and
maintaining
their
evidence
simple
things
sometimes
but
vital
rules
of
thumb
for
street
cops
who
nowadays
often
stumble
across
a
busy
computer
in
the
midst
of
a
drug
investigation
or
a
bust
for
instance
photograph
the
system
before
you
touch
it
label
the
ends
of
all
the
cables
before
you
detach
anything
park
the
heads
on
the
disk
drives
before
you
move
them
get
the
diskettes
do
put
the
diskettes
in
magnetic
fields
do
write
on
diskettes
with
ballpoint
pens
get
the
manuals
get
the
printouts
get
the
handwritten
notes
copy
data
before
you
look
at
it
and
then
examine
the
copy
instead
of
the
original
now
our
lecturer
distributed
copied
diagrams
of
a
typical
lan
or
local
area
network
which
happened
to
be
out
of
connecticut
one
hundred
and
desktop
computers
each
with
its
own
peripherals
three
file
servers
five
star
couplers
each
with
ports
one
coupler
off
in
the
corner
office
all
these
machines
talking
to
each
other
distributing
electronic
mail
distributing
software
distributing
quite
possibly
criminal
evidence
all
linked
by
cable
a
bad
guy
cops
talk
a
about
bad
guys
might
be
lurking
on
pc
lot
or
and
distributing
his
ill
doings
onto
some
dupe
personal
machine
in
another
office
or
another
floor
or
quite
possibly
two
or
three
miles
away
or
conceivably
the
evidence
might
be
split
up
into
meaningless
slivers
stored
one
by
one
on
a
whole
crowd
of
different
disk
drives
the
lecturer
challenged
us
for
solutions
i
for
one
was
utterly
clueless
as
far
as
i
could
figure
the
cossacks
were
at
the
gate
there
were
probably
more
disks
in
this
single
building

somebody

right
there
always
the
human
angle
something
easy
to
forget
when
contemplating
the
arcane
recesses
of
high
technology
cops
are
skilled
at
getting
people
to
talk
and
computer
people
given
a
chair
and
some
sustained
attention
will
talk
about
their

till
their
throats
go

there
a
case
on
record
of
a
single
question
how
you
do
it
eliciting
a
videotaped
confession
from
a
computer
criminal
who
not
only
completely
incriminated
himself
but
drew
helpful
diagrams
computer

pathologically
why
else
are

stealing

natter
for
ten
hours
straight
to
their
friends
on
an
opposite
seaboard
people
do
in
fact
possess
an
arsenal
of
nifty
gadgets
and
techniques
that
would
allow
them
to
conceal
all
kinds
of
exotic
skullduggery
and
if
they
could
only
shut
up
about
it
they
could
probably
get
away
with
all
manner
of
amazing
but
that
just
not
how
it
works
or
at
least
that
not
how
it
worked
so
far
most
every
ever
busted
has
swiftly
implicated
his
mentors
his
disciples
and
his
friends
most
every
smugly
convinced
that
his
clever
scheme
is
bulletproof
swiftly
learns
otherwise
when
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
an
actual
policeman
leans
over
grabs
the
front
of
his
shirt
looks
him
right
in
the
eye
and
says
all
right
asshole
you
and
me
are
going
downtown
all
the
hardware
in
the
world
will
not
insulate
your
nerves
from
these
actual
sensations
of
terror
and
guilt
cops
know
ways
to
get
from
point
a
to
point
z
without
thumbing
through
every
letter
in
some
alphabet
cops
know
how
to
cut
to
the
chase
cops
know
a
lot
of
things
other
people
do
know
hackers
know
a
lot
of
things
other
people
do
know
too
hackers
know
for
instance
how
to
sneak
into
your
computer
through
the
but
cops
can
show
up
right
on
your
doorstep
and
carry
off
you
and
your
computer
in
separate
steel
boxes
a
cop
interested
in
hackers
can
grab
them
and
grill
them
a
hacker
interested
in
cops
has
to
depend
on
hearsay
underground
legends
and
what
cops
are
willing
to
publicly
reveal
and
the
secret
service
did
get
named
the
secret
service
because
they
blab
a
lot
some
people
our
lecturer
informed
us
were
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
it
was
impossible
to
tap
a
line
well
he
announced
he
and
his
son
had
just
whipped
up
a
tap
in
his
workshop
at
home
he
passed
it
around
the
audience
along
with
a
lan
card
so
we
all
recognize
one
if
we
saw
it
on
a
case
we
all
had
a
look
the
tap
was
a
classic
goofy
prototype
a
rounded
metal
cylinder
with
a
pair
of
plastic
brackets
on
it
from
one
end
dangled
three
thin
black
cables
each
of
which
ended
in
a
tiny
black
plastic
cap
when
you
plucked
the
off
the
end
of
a
cable
you
could
see
the
glass
fiber
no
thicker
than
a
pinhole
our
lecturer
informed
us
that
the
metal
cylinder
was
a
wavelength
division
multiplexer
apparently
what
one
did
was
to
cut
the
cable
insert
two
of
the
legs
into
the
cut
to
complete
the
network
again
and
then
read
any
passing
data
on
the
line
by
hooking
up
the
third
leg
to
some
kind
of
monitor
sounded
simple
enough
i
wondered
why
nobody
had
thought
of
it
before
i
also
wondered
whether
this
guy
son
back
at
the
workshop
had
any
teenage
friends
we
had
a
break
the
guy
sitting
next
to
me
was
wearing
a
giveaway
baseball
cap
advertising
the
uzi
submachine
gun
we
had
a
desultory
chat
about
the
merits
of
uzis
long
a
favorite
of
the
secret
service
it
seems
uzis
went
out
of
fashion
with
the
advent
of
the
persian
gulf
war
our
arab
allies
taking
some
offense
at
americans
toting
israeli
weapons
besides
i
was
informed
by
another
expert
uzis
jam
the
equivalent
weapon
of
choice
today
is
the
heckler
koch
manufactured
in
germany
the
guy
with
the
uzi
cap
was
a
forensic
photographer
he
also
did
a
lot
of
photographic
surveillance
work
in
computer
crime
cases
he
used
to
that
is
until
the
firings
in
phoenix
he
was
now
a
private
investigator
and
with
his
wife
ran
a
photography
salon
specializing
in
weddings
and
portrait
photos
at
one
must
repeat
a
considerable
rise
in
income
he
was
still
fcic
if
you
were
fcic
and
you
needed
to
talk
to
an
expert
about
forensic
photography
well
there
he
was
willing
and
able
if
he
had
shown
up
people
would
have
missed
him
our
lecturer
had
raised
the
point
that
preliminary
investigation
of
a
computer
system
is
vital
before
any
seizure
is
undertaken
it
vital
to
understand
how
many
machines
are
in
there
what
kinds
there
are
what
kind
of
operating
system
they
use
how
many
people
use
them
where
the
actual
data
itself
is
stored
to
simply
barge
into
an
office
demanding
all
the
computers
is
a
recipe
for
swift
disaster
this
entails
some
discreet
inquiries
beforehand
in
fact
what
it
entails
is
basically
undercover
work
an
intelligence
operation
spying
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
on
it
in
a
chat
after
the
lecture
i
asked
an
attendee
whether
trashing
might
work
i
received
a
swift
briefing
on
the
theory
and
practice
of
trash
covers
police
trash
covers
like
mail
covers
or
like
wiretaps
require
the
agreement
of
a
judge
this
obtained
the
trashing
work
of
cops
is
just
like
that
of
hackers
only
more
so
and
much
better
organized
so
much
so
i
was
informed
that
mobsters
in
phoenix
make
extensive
use
of
locked
garbage
cans
picked
up
by
a
specialty
trash
company
in
one
case
a
tiger
team
of
arizona
cops
had
trashed
a
local
residence
for
four
months
every
week
they
showed
up
on
the
municipal
garbage
truck
disguised
as
garbagemen
and
carried
the
contents
of
the
suspect
cans
off
to
a
shade
tree
where
they
combed
through
the
garbage
a
messy
task
especially
considering
that
one
of
the
occupants
was
undergoing
kidney
dialysis
all
useful
documents
were
cleaned
dried
and
examined
a
discarded
was
an
especially
valuable
source
of
data
as
its
long
ribbon
of
film
contained
the
contents
of
every
letter
mailed
out
of
the
house
the
letters
were
neatly
retyped
by
a
police
secretary
equipped
with
a
large
magnifying
glass
there
is
something
weirdly
disquieting
about
the
whole
subject
of
trashing
an
unsuspected
and
indeed
rather
disgusting
mode
of
deep
personal
vulnerability
things
that
we
pass
by
every
day
that
we
take
utterly
for
granted
can
be
exploited
with
so
little
work
once
discovered
the
knowledge
of
these
vulnerabilities
tend
to
spread
take
the
lowly
subject
of
manhole
covers
the
humble
manhole
cover
reproduces
many
of
the
dilemmas
of
in
miniature
manhole
covers
are
of
course
technological
artifacts
to
our
buried
urban
infrastructure
to
the
vast
majority
of
us
manhole
covers
are
invisible
they
are
also
vulnerable
for
many
years
now
the
secret
service
has
made
a
point
of
caulking
manhole
covers
along
all
routes
of
the
presidential
motorcade
this
is
of
course
to
deter
terrorists
from
leaping
out
of
underground
ambush
or
more
likely
planting
bombs
beneath
the
street
lately
manhole
covers
have
seen
more
and
more
criminal
exploitation
especially
in
new
york
city
recently
a
telco
in
new
york
city
discovered
that
a
cable
television
service
had
been
sneaking
into
telco
manholes
and
installing
cable
service
alongside
the
without
paying
royalties
new
york
companies
have
also
suffered
a
general
plague
of
a
underground
copper
cable
theft
b
dumping
of
garbage
including
toxic
waste
and
c
hasty
dumping
of
murder
victims
industry
complaints
reached
the
ears
of
an
innovative
new
england
company
and
the
result
was
a
new
product
known
as
the
intimidator
a
thick
bolt
with
a
precisely
machined
head
that
requires
a
special
device
to
unscrew
all
these
keys
have
registered
serial
numbers
kept
on
file
with
the
manufacturer
there
are
now
some
thousands
of
these
intimidator
bolts
being
sunk
into
american
pavements
wherever
our
president
passes
like
some
macabre
parody
of
strewn
roses
they
are
also
spreading
as
fast
as
steel
dandelions
around
us
military
bases
and
many
centers
of
private
industry
quite
likely
it
has
never
occurred
to
you
to
peer
under
a
manhole
cover
perhaps
climb
down
and
walk
around
down
there
with
a
flashlight
just
to
see
what
it
like
formally
speaking
this
might
be
trespassing
but
if
you
did
hurt
anything
and
did
make
an
absolute
habit
of
it
nobody
would
really
care
the
freedom
to
sneak
under
manholes
was
likely
a
freedom
you
never
intended
to
exercise
you
now
are
rather
less
likely
to
have
that
freedom
at
all
you
may
never
even
have
missed
it
until
you
read
about
it
here
but
if
you
in
new
york
city
it
gone
and
elsewhere
it
likely
going
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
crime
and
the
reaction
to
crime
does
to
us
the
tenor
of
the
meeting
now
changed
as
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
arrived
the
eff
whose
personnel
and
history
will
be
examined
in
detail
in
the
next
chapter
are
a
pioneering
civil
liberties
group
who
arose
in
direct
response
to
the
hacker
crackdown
of
now
mitchell
kapor
the
foundation
president
and
michael
godwin
its
chief
attorney
were
confronting
federal
law
enforcement
mano
a
mano
for
the
first
time
ever
ever
alert
to
the
manifold
uses
of
publicity
mitch
kapor
and
mike
godwin
had
brought
their
own
journalist
in
tow
robert
draper
from
austin
whose
recent
book
about
rolling
stone
magazine
was
still
on
the
stands
draper
was
on
assignment
for
texas
monthly
the
steve
civil
lawsuit
against
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
was
a
matter
of
considerable
regional
interest
in
texas
there
were
now
two
austinite
journalists
here
on
the
case
in
fact
counting
godwin
a
former
austinite
and
former
journalist
there
were
three
of
us
lunch
was
like
old
home
week
later
i
took
draper
up
to
my
hotel
room
we
had
a
long
frank
talk
about
the
case
networking
earnestly
like
a
miniature
version
of
the
fcic
privately
confessing
the
numerous
blunders
of
journalists
covering
the
story
and
trying
hard
to
figure
out
who
was
who
and
what
the
hell
was
really
going
on
out
there
i
showed
draper
everything
i
had
dug
out
of
the
hilton
trashcan
we
pondered
the
ethics
of
trashing
for
a
while
and
agreed
that
they
were
dismal
we
also
agreed
that
finding
a
sprint
bill
on
your
first
time
out
was
a
heck
of
a
coincidence
first
i
trashed
and
now
mere
hours
later
i
bragged
to
someone
else
having
entered
the
lifestyle
of
hackerdom
i
was
now
unsurprisingly
following
its
logic
having
discovered
something
remarkable
through
a
surreptitious
action
i
of
course
had
to
brag
and
to
drag
the
passing
draper
into
my
iniquities
i
felt
i
needed
a
witness
otherwise
nobody
would
have
believed
what
i
discovered
back
at
the
meeting
thackeray
cordially
if
rather
tentatively
introduced
kapor
and
godwin
to
her
colleagues
papers
were
distributed
kapor
took
center
stage
the
brilliant
bostonian
entrepreneur
normally
the
hawk
in
his
own
administration
and
quite
an
effective
public
speaker
seemed
visibly
nervous
and
frankly
admitted
as
much
he
began
by
saying
he
consided
to
be
morally
wrong
and
that
the
eff
was
not
a
hacker
defense
fund
despite
what
had
appeared
in
print
kapor
chatted
a
bit
about
the
basic
motivations
of
his
group
emphasizing
their
good
faith
and
willingness
to
listen
and
seek
common
ground
with
law
enforcement
when
er
possible
then
at
godwin
urging
kapor
suddenly
remarked
that
eff
own
internet
machine
had
been
hacked
recently
and
that
eff
did
not
consider
this
incident
amusing
after
this
surprising
confession
things
began
to
loosen
up
quite
rapidly
soon
kapor
was
fielding
questions
parrying
objections
challenging
definitions
and
juggling
paradigms
with
something
akin
to
his
usual
gusto
kapor
seemed
to
score
quite
an
effect
with
his
shrewd
and
skeptical
analysis
of
the
merits
of
telco
services
on
this
topic
fcic
and
eff
have
never
been
at
loggerheads
and
have
no
particular
established
earthworks
to
defend
has
generally
been
promoted
as
a
privacy
service
for
consumers
a
presentation
kapor
described
as
a
smokescreen
the
real
point
of
being
to
allow
corporate
customers
to
build
extensive
commercial
databases
on
everybody
who
phones
or
faxes
them
clearly
few
people
in
the
room
had
considered
this
possibility
except
perhaps
for
two
from
us
west
rboc
security
who
chuckled
nervously
mike
godwin
then
made
an
extensive
presentation
on
civil
liberties
implications
of
computer
searches
and
seizures
now
at
last
we
were
getting
to
the
real
here
real
political
the
audience
listened
with
close
attention
angry
mutters
rising
occasionally
he
trying
to
teach
us
our
jobs
we
been
thinking
about
this
for
years
we
think
about
these
issues
every
day
if
i
did
seize
the
works
i
be
sued
by
the
guy
victims
i
violating
the
law
if
i
leave
ten
thousand
disks
full
of
illegal
pirated
software
and
stolen
codes
it
our
job
to
make
sure
people
do
trash
the
constitution
we
the
defenders
of
the
constitution
we
seize
stuff
when
we
know
it
will
be
forfeited
anyway
as
restitution
for
the
victim
if
it
forfeitable
then
do
get
a
search
warrant
get
a
forfeiture
warrant
godwin
suggested
coolly
he
further
remarked
that
most
suspects
in
computer
crime
do
want
to
see
their
computers
vanish
out
the
door
headed
god
knew
where
for
who
knows
how
long
they
might
not
mind
a
search
even
an
extensive
search
but
they
want
their
machines
searched
are
they
gon
na
feed
us
somebody
asked
sourly
how
about
if
you
take
copies
of
the
data
godwin
parried
that
never
stand
up
in
court
okay
you
make
copies
give
them
the
copies
and
take
the
originals
hmmm
godwin
championed
systems
as
repositories
of
first
amendment
protected
free
speech
he
complained
that
federal
training
manuals
gave
boards
a
bad
press
suggesting
that
they
are
hotbeds
of
crime
haunted
by
pedophiles
and
crooks
whereas
the
vast
majority
of
the
thousands
of
boards
are
completely
innocuous
and
nowhere
near
so
romantically
suspicious
people
who
run
boards
violently
resent
it
when
their
systems
are
seized
and
their
dozens
or
hundreds
of
users
look
on
in
abject
horror
their
rights
of
free
expression
are
cut
short
their
right
to
associate
with
other
people
is
infringed
and
their
privacy
is
violated
as
their
private
electronic
mail
becomes
police
property
not
a
soul
spoke
up
to
defend
the
practice
of
seizing
boards
the
issue
passed
in
chastened
silence
legal
principles
aside
and
those
principles
can
not
be
settled
without
laws
passed
or
court
precedents
seizing
bulletin
boards
has
become
poison
for
american
computer
police
and
anyway
it
not
entirely
necessary
if
you
a
cop
you
can
get
everything
you
need
from
a
pirate
board
just
by
using
an
inside
informant
plenty
of
vigilantes
well
concerned
citizens
will
inform
police
the
moment
they
see
a
pirate
board
hit
their
area
and
will
tell
the
police
all
about
it
in
such
technical
detail
actually
that
you
kinda
wish
they
shut
up
they
will
happily
supply
police
with
extensive
downloads
or
printouts
it
impossible
to
keep
this
fluid
electronic
information
out
of
the
hands
of
police
some
people
in
the
electronic
community
become
enraged
at
the
prospect
of
cops
monitoring
bulletin
boards
this
does
have
touchy
aspects
as
secret
service
people
in
particular
examine
bulletin
boards
with
some
regularity
but
to
expect
electronic
police
to
be
deaf
dumb
and
blind
in
regard
to
this
particular
medium
rather
flies
in
the
face
of
common
sense
police
watch
television
listen
to
radio
read
newspapers
and
magazines
why
should
the
new
medium
of
boards
be
different
cops
can
exercise
the
same
access
to
electronic
information
as
everybody
else
as
we
have
seen
quite
a
few
computer
police
maintain
their
own
bulletin
boards
including
sting
boards
which
have
generally
proven
quite
effective
as
a
final
clincher
their
mountie
friends
in
canada
and
colleagues
in
ireland
and
taiwan
do
have
first
amendment
or
american
constitutional
restrictions
but
they
do

godwin
complained
at
length
about
what
he
called
the
clever
hobbyist
hypothesis
the
assumption
that
the
hacker
you
busting
is
clearly
a
technical
genius
and
must
therefore
by
searched
with
extreme
thoroughness
so
from
the
law
point
of
view
why
risk
missing
anything
take
the
works
take
the

take
his

take

godwin
pointed
out
that
most
hackers
are
not
in
fact
clever
genius
hobbyists
quite
a
few
are
crooks
and
grifters
who
have
much
in
the
way
of
technical
sophistication
just
some
techniques
the
same
goes
for
most
downloaded
a
program
from
a
pirate
board
there
no
real
need
to
seize
everything
in
sight
it
does
require
an
entire
computer
system
and
ten
thousand
disks
to
prove
a
case
in
court
what
if
the
computer
is
the
instrumentality
of
a
crime
someone
demanded
godwin
admitted
quietly
that
the
doctrine
of
seizing
the
instrumentality
of
a
crime
was
pretty
well
established
in
the
american
legal
system
the
meeting
broke
up
godwin
and
kapor
had
to
leave
kapor
was
testifying
next
morning
before
the
massachusetts
department
of
public
utility
about
isdn
narrowband
networking
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
thackeray
seemed
elated
she
had
taken
a
great
risk
with
this
her
colleagues
had
not
in
fact
torn
kapor
and
godwin
heads
off
she
was
very
proud
of
them
and
told
them
so
did
you
hear
what
godwin
said
about
instrumentality
of
a
crime
she
exulted
to
nobody
in
particular
wow
that
means
mitch
is
going
to
sue
me
america
computer
police
are
an
interesting
group
as
a
social
phenomenon
they
are
far
more
interesting
and
far
more
important
than
teenage
phone
phreaks
and
computer
hackers
first
they
older
and
wiser
not
dizzy
hobbyists
with
leaky
morals
but
seasoned
adult
professionals
with
all
the
responsibilities
of
public
service
and
unlike
hackers
they
possess
not
merely
technical
power
alone
but
legal
and
social
authority
and
very
interestingly
they
are
just
as
much
at
sea
in
cyberspace
as
everyone
else
they
are
not
happy
about
this
police
are
authoritarian
by
nature
and
prefer
to
obey
rules
and
precedents
even
those
police
who
secretly
enjoy
a
fast
ride
in
rough
territory
will
soberly
disclaim
any
cowboy
attitude
but
in
cyberspace
there
are
no
rules
and
precedents
they
are
groundbreaking
pioneers
cyberspace
rangers
whether
they
like
it
or
not
in
my
opinion
any
teenager
enthralled
by
computers
fascinated
by
the
ins
and
outs
of
computer
security
and
attracted
by
the
lure
of
specialized
forms
of
knowledge
and
power
would
do
well
to
forget
all
about
hacking
and
set
his
or
her
sights
on
becoming
a
fed
feds
can
trump
hackers
at
almost
every
single
thing
hackers
do
including
gathering
intelligence
undercover
disguise
trashing
building
dossiers
networking
and
infiltrating
computer
systems
criminal
computer
systems
secret
service
agents
know
more
about
phreaking
coding
and
carding
than
most
phreaks
can
find
out
in
years
and
when
it
comes
to
viruses
software
bombs
and
trojan
horses
feds
have
direct
access
to
confidential
information
that
is
only
vague
rumor
in
the
underground
and
if
it
an
impressive
public
rep
you
after
there
are
few
people
in
the
world
who
can
be
so
chillingly
impressive
as
a
united
states
secret
service
agent
of
course
a
few
personal
sacrifices
are
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
that
power
and
knowledge
first
you
have
the
galling
discipline
of
belonging
to
a
large
organization
but
the
world
of
computer
crime
is
still
so
small
and
so
amazingly
that
it
will
remain
spectacularly
fluid
for
years
to
come
the
second
sacrifice
is
that
you
have
to
give
up
ripping
people
off
this
is
not
a
great
loss
abstaining
from
the
use
of
illegal
drugs
also
necessary
will
be
a
boon
to
your
health
a
career
in
computer
security
is
not
a
bad
choice
for
a
young
man
or
woman
today
the
field
will
almost
certainly
expand
drastically
in
years
to
come
if
you
are
a
teenager
today
by
the
time
you
become
a
professional
the
pioneers
you
have
read
about
in
this
book
will
be
the
grand
old
men
and
women
of
the
field
swamped
by
their
many
disciples
and
successors
of
course
some
of
them
like
william
wood
of
the
secret
service
may
well
be
mangled
in
the
whirring
machinery
of
legal
controversy
but
by
the
time
you
enter
the
field
it
may
have
stabilized
somewhat
while
remaining
entertainingly
challenging
but
you
ca
just
have
a
badge
you
have
to
win
it
first
there
the
federal
law
enforcement
training
and
it
hard
it
a
challenge
a
real
challenge
not
for
wimps
and
rodents
every
secret
service
agent
must
complete
gruelling
courses
at
the
federal
law
enforcement
training
center
in
fact
secret
service
agents
are
periodically
during
their
entire
careers
in
order
to
get
a
glimpse
of
what
this
might
be
like
i
myself
travelled
to
fletc
the
federal
law
enforcement
training
center
is
a
facility
on
georgia
atlantic
coast
it
a
milieu
of
marshgrass
seabirds
damp
clinging
palmettos
mosquitos
and
bats
until
it
was
a
navy
air
base
and
still
features
a
working
runway
and
some
wwii
vintage
blockhouses
and
officers
quarters
the
center
has
since
benefitted
by
a
retrofit
but
there
still
enough
forest
and
swamp
on
the
facility
for
the
border
patrol
to
put
in
tracking
practice
as
a
town
glynco
scarcely
exists
the
nearest
real
town
is
brunswick
a
few
miles
down
highway
where
i
stayed
at
the
aptly
named
marshview
holiday
inn
i
had
sunday
dinner
at
a
seafood
restaurant
called
jinright
where
i
feasted
on
alligator
tail
this
local
favorite
was
a
heaped
basket
of
chunks
of
white
tender
almost
fluffy
reptile
meat
steaming
in
a
peppered
batter
crust
alligator
makes
a
culinary
experience
that
hard
to
forget
especially
when
liberally
basted
with
homemade
cocktail
sauce
from
a
jinright
the
crowded
clientele
were
tourists
fishermen
local
black
folks
in
their
sunday
best
and
white
georgian
locals
who
all
seemed
to
bear
an
uncanny
resemblance
to
georgia
humorist
lewis
grizzard
the
students
from
federal
agencies
who
make
up
the
fletc
population
scarcely
seem
to
make
a
dent
in
the
local
scene
the
students
look
like
tourists
and
the
teachers
seem
to
have
taken
on
much
of
the
relaxed
air
of
the
deep
south
my
host
was
carlton
fitzpatrick
the
program
coordinator
of
the
financial
fraud
institute
carlton
fitzpatrick
is
a
mustached
sinewy
alabama
native
somewhere
near
his
late
forties
with
a
fondness
for
chewing
tobacco
powerful
computers
and
salty
homilies
we
met
before
at
fcic
in
arizona
the
financial
fraud
institute
is
one
of
the
nine
divisions
at
fletc
besides
financial
fraud
there
driver
marine
firearms
and
physical
training
these
are
specialized
pursuits
there
are
also
five
general
training
divisions
basic
training
operations
enforcement
techniques
legal
division
and
behavioral
science
somewhere
in
this
curriculum
is
everything
necessary
to
turn
green
college
graduates
into
federal
agents
first
they
given
id
cards
then
they
get
the
rather
blue
coveralls
known
as
smurf
suits
the
trainees
are
assigned
a
barracks
and
a
cafeteria
and
immediately
set
on
fletc
physical
training
routine
besides
the
obligatory
daily
jogging
the
trainers
run
up
danger
flags
beside
the
track
when
the
humidity
rises
high
enough
to
threaten
heat
stroke
here
the
nautilus
machines
the
martial
arts
the
survival
skills
the
eighteen
federal
agencies
who
maintain
academies
at
fletc
employ
a
wide
variety
of
specialized
law
enforcement
units
some
of
them
rather
arcane
there
border
patrol
irs
criminal
investigation
division
park
service
fish
and
wildlife
customs
immigration
secret
service
and
the
treasury
uniformed
subdivisions
if
you
a
federal
cop
and
you
do
work
for
the
fbi
you
train
at
fletc
this
includes
people
as
apparently
obscure
as
the
agents
of
the
railroad
retirement
board
inspector
general
or
the
tennessee
valley
authority
police
who
are
in
fact
federal
police
officers
and
can
and
do
arrest
criminals
on
the
federal
property
of
the
tennessee
valley
authority
and
then
there
are
the
people
all
sorts
all
backgrounds
fitzpatrick
is
not
jealous
of
his
specialized
knowledge
cops
all
over
in
every
branch
of
service
may
feel
a
need
to
learn
what
he
can
teach
backgrounds
do
matter
much
fitzpatrick
himself
was
originally
a
border
patrol
veteran
then
became
a
border
patrol
instructor
at
fletc
his
spanish
is
still
fluent
but
he
found
himself
strangely
fascinated
when
the
first
computers
showed
up
at
the
training
center
fitzpatrick
did
have
a
background
in
electrical
engineering
and
though
he
never
considered
himself
a
computer
hacker
he
somehow
found
himself
writing
useful
little
programs
for
this
new
and
promising
gizmo
he
began
looking
into
the
general
subject
of
computers
and
crime
reading
donn
parker
books
and
articles
keeping
an
ear
cocked
for
war
stories
useful
insights
from
the
field
the
people
of
the
local
and
units
soon
he
got
a
reputation
around
fletc
as
the
resident
computer
expert
and
that
reputation
alone
brought
him
more
exposure
more
experience
until
one
day
he
looked
around
and
sure
enough
he
was
a
federal
expert
in
fact
this
unassuming
genial
man
may
be
the
federal
expert
there
are
plenty
of
very
good
computer
people
and
plenty
of
very
good
federal
investigators
but
the
area
where
these
worlds
of
expertise
overlap
is
very
slim
and
carlton
fitzpatrick
has
been
right
at
the
center
of
that
since
the
first
year
of
the
colluquy
a
group
which
owes
much
to
his
influence
he
seems
quite
at
home
in
his
modest
office
with
its
ansel
western
photographic
art
a
senior
instructor
certificate
and
a
towering
bookcase
crammed
with
binders
with
ominous
titles
such
as
datapro
reports
on
information
security
and
cfca
telecom
security
the
phone
rings
every
ten
minutes
colleagues
show
up
at
the
door
to
chat
about
new
developments
in
locksmithing
or
to
shake
their
heads
over
the
latest
dismal
developments
in
the
bcci
global
banking
scandal
carlton
fitzpatrick
is
a
fount
of
related
in
an
acerbic
drawl
he
tells
me
the
colorful
tale
of
a
hacker
caught
in
california
some
years
back
he
been
raiding
systems
typing
code
without
a
detectable
break
for
twenty
hours
straight
not
just
logged
on
typing
investigators
were
baffled
nobody
could
do
that
did
he
have
to
go
to
the
bathroom
was
it
some
kind
of
automatic
device
that
could
actually
type
code
a
raid
on
the
suspect
home
revealed
a
situation
of
astonishing
squalor
the
hacker
turned
out
to
be
a
pakistani
student
who
had
flunked
out
of
a
california
university
he
gone
completely
underground
as
an
illegal
electronic
immigrant
and
was
selling
stolen
to
stay
alive
the
place
was
not
merely
messy
and
dirty
but
in
a
state
of
psychotic
disorder
powered
by
some
weird
mix
of
culture
shock
computer
addiction
and
amphetamines
the
suspect
had
in
fact
been
sitting
in
front
of
his
computer
for
a
day
and
a
half
straight
with
snacks
and
drugs
at
hand
on
the
edge
of
his
desk
and
a
under
his
chair
word
about
stuff
like
this
gets
around
in
the
community
carlton
fitzpatrick
takes
me
for
a
guided
tour
by
car
around
the
fletc
grounds
one
of
our
first
sights
is
the
biggest
indoor
firing
range
in
the
world
there
are
federal
trainees
in
there
fitzpatrick
assures
me
politely
blasting
away
with
a
wide
variety
of
automatic
weapons
uzis
glocks
he
willing
to
take
me
inside
i
tell
him
i
sure
that
really
interesting
but
i
rather
see
his
computers
carlton
fitzpatrick
seems
quite
surprised
and
pleased
i
apparently
the
first
journalist
he
ever
seen
who
has
turned
down
the
shooting
gallery
in
favor
of
microchips
our
next
stop
is
a
favorite
with
touring
congressmen
the
long
fletc
driving
range
here
trainees
of
the
driver
marine
division
are
taught
pursuit
skills
setting
and
breaking
diplomatic
security
driving
for
vip
limousines
a
favorite
fletc
pastime
is
to
strap
a
passing
senator
into
the
passenger
seat
beside
a
driver
marine
trainer
hit
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
then
take
it
right
into
the
a
section
of
greased
track
where
two
tons
of
detroit
iron
can
whip
and
spin
like
a
hockey
puck
cars
do
fare
well
at
fletc
first
they
rifled
again
and
again
for
search
practice
then
they
do
miles
of
pursuit
training
they
get
about
seventy
miles
per
set
of
radials
then
it
off
to
the
skid
pan
where
sometimes
they
roll
and
tumble
headlong
in
the
grease
when
they
sufficiently
dented
and
creaky
they
sent
to
the
roadblock
unit
where
they
battered
without
pity
and
finally
then
they
sacrificed
to
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
whose
trainees
learn
the
ins
and
outs
of
work
by
blowing
them
into
smoking
wreckage
there
a
railroad
on
the
fletc
grounds
and
a
large
grounded
boat
and
a
propless
plane
all
for
searches
the
plane
sits
forlornly
on
a
patch
of
weedy
tarmac
next
to
an
eerie
blockhouse
known
as
the
ninja
compound
where
specialists
practice
hostage
rescues
as
i
gaze
on
this
creepy
paragon
of
modern
warfare
my
nerves
are
jangled
by
a
sudden
staccato
outburst
of
automatic
weapons
fire
somewhere
in
the
woods
to
my
right
fitzpatrick
judges
calmly
even
the
eldritch
ninja
compound
pales
somewhat
compared
to
the
truly
surreal
area
known
as
the
this
is
a
street
lined
on
both
sides
with
nondescript
houses
with
flat
pebbled
roofs
they
were
once
officers
quarters
now
they
are
training
grounds
the
first
one
to
our
left
fitzpatrick
tells
me
has
been
specially
adapted
for
computer
practice
inside
it
has
been
wired
for
video
from
top
to
bottom
with
eighteen
remotely
controlled
videocams
mounted
on
walls
and
in
corners
every
movement
of
the
trainee
agent
is
recorded
live
by
teachers
for
later
taped
analysis
wasted
movements
hesitations
possibly
lethal
tactical
mistakes
all
are
gone
over
in
detail
perhaps
the
weirdest
single
aspect
of
this
building
is
its
front
door
scarred
and
scuffed
all
along
the
bottom
from
the
repeated
impact
day
after
day
of
federal
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
row
of
some
people
are
practicing
a
murder
we
drive
by
slowly
as
some
very
young
and
rather
federal
trainees
interview
a
heavyset
bald
man
on
the
lawn
dealing
with
murder
takes
a
lot
of
practice
first
you
have
to
learn
to
control
your
own
instinctive
disgust
and
panic
then
you
have
to
learn
to
control
the
reactions
of
a
crowd
of
civilians
some
of
whom
may
have
just
lost
a
loved
one
some
of
whom
may
be
murderers
quite
possibly
both
at
once
a
dummy
plays
the
corpse
the
roles
of
the
bereaved
the
morbidly
curious
and
the
homicidal
are
played
for
pay
by
local
georgians
waitresses
musicians
most
anybody
who
needs
to
moonlight
and
can
learn
a
script
these
people
some
of
whom
are
fletc
regulars
year
after
year
must
surely
have
one
of
the
strangest
jobs
in
the
world
something
about
the
scene
normal
people
in
a
weird
situation
standing
around
talking
in
bright
georgia
sunshine
unsuccessfully
pretending
that
something
dreadful
has
gone
on
while
a
dummy
lies
inside
on
faked
bloodstains
while
behind
this
weird
masquerade
like
a
nested
set
of
russian
dolls
are
grim
future
realities
of
real
death
real
violence
real
murders
of
real
people
that
these
young
agents
will
really
investigate
many
times
during
their
careers
over
and
over
will
those
anticipated
murders
look
like
this
feel
like
this
not
as
real
as
these
amateur
actors
are
trying
to
make
it
seem
but
both
as
real
and
as
numbingly
unreal
as
watching
fake
people
standing
around
on
a
fake
lawn
something
about
this
scene
unhinges
me
it
seems
nightmarish
to
me
kafkaesque
i
simply
know
how
to
take
it
my
head
is
turned
around
i
do
know
whether
to
laugh
cry
or
just
shudder
when
the
tour
is
over
carlton
fitzpatrick
and
i
talk
about
computers
for
the
first
time
cyberspace
seems
like
quite
a
comfortable
place
it
seems
very
real
to
me
suddenly
a
place
where
i
know
what
i
talking
about
a
place
i
used
to
it
real
real
whatever
carlton
fitzpatrick
is
the
only
person
i
met
in
cyberspace
circles
who
is
happy
with
his
present
equipment
he
got
a
meg
ram
pc
with
a
meg
hard
disk
a
meg
on
the
way
he
got
a
compaq
desktop
and
a
zenith
laptop
with
meg
down
the
hall
is
a
nec
with
a
drive
and
a
baud
modem
with
four
there
a
training
minicomputer
and
a
local
mini
just
for
the
center
and
a
of
student
pc
clones
and
macs
or
so
there
a
data
general
mv
with
meg
on
board
and
a
meg
disk
fitzpatrick
plans
to
run
a
unix
board
on
the
data
general
when
finished
the
software
for
it
which
he
wrote
himself
it
have
features
massive
files
on
all
manner
of
and
investigation
procedures
and
will
follow
the
specifics
of
the
department
of
defense
orange
book
he
thinks
it
will
be
the
biggest
bbs
in
the
federal
government
will
it
have
phrack
on
it
i
ask
wryly
sure
he
tells
me
phrack
tap
computer
underground
digest
all
that
stuff
with
proper
disclaimers
of
course
i
ask
him
if
he
plans
to
be
the
sysop
running
a
system
that
size
is
very
and
fitzpatrick
teaches
two
courses
every
day
no
he
says
seriously
fletc
has
to
get
its
money
worth
out
of
the
instructors
he
thinks
he
can
get
a
local
volunteer
to
do
it
a
student
he
says
a
bit
more
something
i
think
about
an
eagle
scout
liaison
program
but
my
mind
has
rocketed
off
in
disbelief
you
going
to
put
a
teenager
in
charge
of
a
federal
security
bbs
i
speechless
it
has
escaped
my
notice
that
the
fletc
financial
fraud
institute
is
the
ultimate
target
there
is
stuff
in
here
stuff
of
such
utter
and
consummate
cool
by
every
standard
of
the
digital
underground
i
imagine
the
hackers
of
my
acquaintance
fainting
from
at
the
mere
prospect
of
cracking
the
superultra
computers
used
to
train
the
secret
service
in
uhm
carlton
i
babble
i
sure
he
a
really
nice
kid
and
all
but
that
a
terrible
temptation
to
set
in
front
of
somebody
who
you
know
into
computers
and
just
starting
out
yeah
he
says
that
did
occur
to
me
for
the
first
time
i
begin
to
suspect
that
he
pulling
my
leg
he
seems
proudest
when
he
shows
me
an
ongoing
project
called
jicc
joint
intelligence
control
council
it
based
on
the
services
provided
by
epic
the
el
paso
intelligence
center
which
supplies
data
and
intelligence
to
the
drug
enforcement
administration
the
customs
service
the
coast
guard
and
the
state
police
of
the
four
southern
border
states
certain
epic
files
can
now
be
accessed
by
police
of
central
america
south
america
and
the
caribbean
who
can
also
trade
information
among
themselves
using
a
telecom
program
called
white
hat
written
by
two
brothers
named
lopez
from
the
dominican
republic
police
can
now
network
internationally
on
inexpensive
pcs
carlton
fitzpatrick
is
teaching
a
class
of
agents
from
the
third
world
and
he
very
proud
of
their
progress
perhaps
soon
the
sophisticated
smuggling
networks
of
the
medellin
cartel
will
be
matched
by
a
sophisticated
computer
network
of
the
medellin
cartel
sworn
enemies
they
track
boats
track
contraband
track
the
international
who
now
leap
over
borders
with
great
ease
defeating
the
police
through
the
clever
use
of
fragmented
national
jurisdictions
jicc
and
epic
must
remain
beyond
the
scope
of
this
book
they
seem
to
me
to
be
very
large
topics
fraught
with
complications
that
i
am
not
fit
to
judge
i
do
know
however
that
the
international
networking
of
police
across
national
boundaries
is
something
that
carlton
fitzpatrick
considers
very
important
a
harbinger
of
a
desirable
future
i
also
know
that
networks
by
their
nature
ignore
physical
boundaries
and
i
also
know
that
where
you
put
communications
you
put
a
community
and
that
when
those
communities
become
they
will
fight
to
preserve
themselves
and
to
expand
their
influence
i
make
no
judgements
whether
this
is
good
or
bad
it
just
cyberspace
it
just
the
way
things
are
i
asked
carlton
fitzpatrick
what
advice
he
would
have
for
a
who
wanted
to
shine
someday
in
the
world
of
electronic
law
enforcement
he
told
me
that
the
number
one
rule
was
simply
not
to
be
scared
of
computers
you
do
need
to
be
an
obsessive
computer
weenie
but
you
must
be
buffaloed
just
because
some
machine
looks
fancy
the
advantages
computers
give
smart
crooks
are
matched
by
the
advantages
they
give
smart
cops
cops
in
the
future
will
have
to
enforce
the
law
with
their
heads
not
their
holsters
today
you
can
make
good
cases
without
ever
leaving
your
office
in
the
future
cops
who
resist
the
computer
revolution
will
never
get
far
beyond
walking
a
beat
i
asked
carlton
fitzpatrick
if
he
had
some
single
message
for
the
public
some
single
thing
that
he
would
most
like
the
american
public
to
know
about
his
work
he
thought
about
it
while
yes
he
said
finally
tell
me
the
rules
and
i
teach
those
rules
he
looked
me
straight
in
the
eye
i
do
the
best
that
i
can
part
four
the
civil
libertarians
the
story
of
the
hacker
crackdown
as
we
have
followed
it
thus
far
has
been
technological
subcultural
criminal
and
legal
the
story
of
the
civil
libertarians
though
it
partakes
of
all
those
other
aspects
is
profoundly
and
thoroughly
political
in
the
obscure
struggle
over
the
ownership
and
nature
of
cyberspace
became
loudly
and
irretrievably
public
people
from
some
of
the
oddest
corners
of
american
society
suddenly
found
themselves
public
figures
some
of
these
people
found
this
situation
much
more
than
they
had
ever
bargained
for
they
backpedalled
and
tried
to
retreat
back
to
the
mandarin
obscurity
of
their
cozy
subcultural
niches
this
was
generally
to
prove
a
mistake
but
the
civil
libertarians
seized
the
day
in
they
found
themselves
organizing
propagandizing
persuading
touring
negotiating
posing
for
publicity
photos
submitting
to
interviews
squinting
in
the
limelight
as
they
tried
a
tentative
but
growingly
sophisticated
upon
the
public
stage
it
not
hard
to
see
why
the
civil
libertarians
should
have
this
competitive
advantage
the
hackers
of
the
digital
underground
are
an
hermetic
elite
they
find
it
hard
to
make
any
remotely
convincing
case
for
their
actions
in
front
of
the
general
public
actually
hackers
roundly
despise
the
ignorant
public
and
have
never
trusted
the
judgement
of
the
system
hackers
do
propagandize
but
only
among
themselves
mostly
in
giddy
badly
spelled
manifestos
of
class
warfare
youth
rebellion
or
naive
techie
utopianism
hackers
must
strut
and
boast
in
order
to
establish
and
preserve
their
underground
reputations
but
if
they
speak
out
too
loudly
and
publicly
they
will
break
the
fragile
of
the
underground
and
they
will
be
harrassed
or
arrested
over
the
longer
term
most
hackers
stumble
get
busted
get
betrayed
or
simply
give
up
as
a
political
force
the
digital
underground
is
hamstrung
the
telcos
for
their
part
are
an
ivory
tower
under
protracted
seige
they
have
plenty
of
money
with
which
to
push
their
calculated
public
image
but
they
waste
much
energy
and
goodwill
attacking
one
another
with
slanderous
and
demeaning
ad
campaigns
the
telcos
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
politicians
and
like
hackers
they
do
trust
the
public
judgement
and
this
distrust
may
be
should
the
general
public
of
the
come
to
understand
its
own
best
interests
in
telecommunications
that
might
well
pose
a
grave
threat
to
the
specialized
technical
power
and
authority
that
the
telcos
have
relished
for
over
a
century
the
telcos
do
have
strong
advantages
loyal
employees
specialized
expertise
influence
in
the
halls
of
power
tactical
allies
in
law
enforcement
and
unbelievably
vast
amounts
of
money
but
politically
speaking
they
lack
genuine
grassroots
support
they
simply
do
seem
to
have
many
friends
cops
know
a
lot
of
things
other
people
do
know
but
cops
willingly
reveal
only
those
aspects
of
their
knowledge
that
they
feel
will
meet
their
institutional
purposes
and
further
public
order
cops
have
respect
they
have
responsibilities
they
have
power
in
the
streets
and
even
power
in
the
home
but
cops
do
do
particularly
well
in
limelight
when
pressed
they
will
step
out
in
the
public
gaze
to
threaten
or
to
cajole
prominent
citizens
or
perhaps
to
sternly
lecture
the
naive
and
misguided
but
then
they
go
back
within
their
fortress
of
the
the
courtroom
and
the
the
electronic
civil
libertarians
however
have
proven
to
be
born
political
animals
they
seemed
to
grasp
very
early
on
the
postmodern
truism
that
communication
is
power
publicity
is
power
soundbites
are
power
the
ability
to
shove
one
issue
onto
the
public
agenda
and
keep
it
there
is
power
fame
is
power
simple
personal
fluency
and
eloquence
can
be
power
if
you
can
somehow
catch
the
public
eye
and
ear
the
civil
libertarians
had
no
monopoly
on
technical
power
though
they
all
owned
computers
most
were
not
particularly
advanced
computer
experts
they
had
a
good
deal
of
money
but
nowhere
near
the
earthshaking
wealth
and
the
galaxy
of
resources
possessed
by
telcos
or
federal
agencies
they
had
no
ability
to
arrest
people
they
carried
out
no
phreak
and
hacker
covert
but
they
really
knew
how
to
network
unlike
the
other
groups
in
this
book
the
civil
libertarians
have
operated
very
much
in
the
open
more
or
less
right
in
the
public
they
have
lectured
audiences
galore
and
talked
to
countless
journalists
and
have
learned
to
refine
their
spiels
they
kept
the
cameras
clicking
kept
those
faxes
humming
swapped
that
email
run
those
photocopiers
on
overtime
licked
envelopes
and
spent
small
fortunes
on
airfare
and
in
an
information
society
this
open
overt
obvious
activity
has
proven
to
be
a
profound
advantage
in
the
civil
libertarians
of
cyberspace
assembled
out
of
nowhere
in
particular
at
warp
speed
this
group
actually
a
networking
gaggle
of
interested
parties
which
scarcely
deserves
even
that
loose
term
has
almost
nothing
in
the
way
of
formal
organization
those
formal
civil
libertarian
organizations
which
did
take
an
interest
in
cyberspace
issues
mainly
the
computer
professionals
for
social
responsibility
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union
were
carried
along
by
events
in
and
acted
mostly
as
adjuncts
underwriters
or
the
civil
libertarians
nevertheless
enjoyed
the
greatest
success
of
any
of
the
groups
in
the
crackdown
of
at
this
writing
their
future
looks
rosy
and
the
political
initiative
is
firmly
in
their
hands
this
should
be
kept
in
mind
as
we
study
the
highly
unlikely
lives
and
lifestyles
of
the
people
who
actually
made
this
happen
in
june
apple
computer
of
cupertino
california
had
a
problem
someone
had
illicitly
copied
a
small
piece
of
apple
proprietary
software
software
which
controlled
an
internal
chip
driving
the
macintosh
screen
display
this
color
quickdraw
source
code
was
a
closely
guarded
piece
of
apple
intellectual
property
only
trusted
apple
insiders
were
supposed
to
possess
it
but
the
nuprometheus
league
wanted
things
otherwise
this
person
or
persons
made
several
illicit
copies
of
this
source
code
perhaps
as
many
as
two
dozen
he
or
she
or
they
then
put
those
illicit
floppy
disks
into
envelopes
and
mailed
them
to
people
all
over
america
people
in
the
computer
industry
who
were
associated
with
but
not
directly
employed
by
apple
computer
the
nuprometheus
caper
was
a
complex
highly
ideological
and
very
crime
prometheus
it
will
be
recalled
stole
the
fire
of
the
gods
and
gave
this
potent
gift
to
the
general
ranks
of
downtrodden
mankind
a
similar
attitude
was
implied
for
the
corporate
elite
of
apple
computer
while
the
nu
prometheus
had
himself
cast
in
the
role
of
rebel
demigod
the
illicitly
copied
data
was
given
away
for
free
the
new
prometheus
whoever
he
was
escaped
the
fate
of
the
ancient
greek
prometheus
who
was
chained
to
a
rock
for
centuries
by
the
vengeful
gods
while
an
eagle
tore
and
ate
his
liver
on
the
other
hand
nuprometheus
chickened
out
somewhat
by
comparison
with
his
role
model
the
small
chunk
of
color
quickdraw
code
he
had
filched
and
replicated
was
more
or
less
useless
to
industrial
rivals
or
in
fact
to
anyone
else
instead
of
giving
fire
to
mankind
it
was
more
as
if
nuprometheus
had
photocopied
the
schematics
for
part
of
a
bic
lighter
the
act
was
not
a
genuine
work
of
industrial
espionage
it
was
best
interpreted
as
a
symbolic
deliberate
slap
in
the
face
for
the
apple
corporate
heirarchy
apple
internal
struggles
were
in
the
industry
apple
founders
jobs
and
wozniak
had
both
taken
their
leave
long
since
their
raucous
core
of
senior
employees
had
been
a
barnstorming
crew
of
californians
many
of
them
markedly
less
than
happy
with
the
new
multimillion
dollar
regime
at
apple
many
of
the
programmers
and
developers
who
had
invented
the
macintosh
model
in
the
early
had
also
taken
their
leave
of
the
company
it
was
they
not
the
current
masters
of
apple
corporate
fate
who
had
invented
the
stolen
color
quickdraw
code
the
nuprometheus
stunt
was
to
wound
company
morale
apple
called
the
fbi
the
bureau
takes
an
interest
in
theft
cases
industrial
espionage
and
theft
of
trade
secrets
these
were
likely
the
right
people
to
call
and
rumor
has
it
that
the
entities
responsible
were
in
fact
discovered
by
the
fbi
and
then
quietly
squelched
by
apple
management
nuprometheus
was
never
publicly
charged
with
a
crime
or
prosecuted
or
jailed
but
there
were
no
further
illicit
releases
of
macintosh
internal
software
eventually
the
painful
issue
of
nuprometheus
was
allowed
to
fade
in
the
meantime
however
a
large
number
of
puzzled
bystanders
found
themselves
entertaining
surprise
guests
from
the
fbi
one
of
these
people
was
john
perry
barlow
barlow
is
a
most
unusual
man
difficult
to
describe
in
conventional
terms
he
is
perhaps
best
known
as
a
songwriter
for
the
grateful
dead
for
he
composed
lyrics
for
hell
in
a
bucket
picasso
moon
mexicali
blues
i
need
a
miracle
and
many
more
he
has
been
writing
for
the
band
since
before
we
tackle
the
vexing
question
as
to
why
a
rock
lyricist
should
be
interviewed
by
the
fbi
in
a
case
it
might
be
well
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
the
grateful
dead
the
grateful
dead
are
perhaps
the
most
successful
and
of
the
numerous
cultural
emanations
from
the
district
of
san
francisco
in
the
glory
days
of
movement
politics
and
lysergic
transcendance
the
grateful
dead
are
a
nexus
a
veritable
whirlwind
of
applique
decals
psychedelic
vans
denim
frenzied
dancing
and
open
and
unashamed
drug
use
the
symbols
and
the
realities
of
californian
freak
power
surround
the
grateful
dead
like
knotted
macrame
the
grateful
dead
and
their
thousands
of
deadhead
devotees
are
radical
bohemians
this
much
is
widely
understood
exactly
what
this
implies
in
the
is
rather
more
problematic
the
grateful
dead
are
among
the
world
most
popular
and
wealthy
entertainers
number
according
to
forbes
magazine
right
between
hammer
and
sean
connery
in
this
group
of
purported
raffish
outcasts
earned
seventeen
million
dollars
they
have
been
earning
sums
much
along
this
line
for
quite
some
time
now
and
while
the
dead
are
not
investment
bankers
or
tax
specialists
they
are
in
point
of
fact
hippie
musicians
this
money
has
not
been
squandered
in
senseless
bohemian
excess
the
dead
have
been
quietly
active
for
many
years
funding
various
worthy
activities
in
their
extensive
and
widespread
cultural
community
the
grateful
dead
are
not
conventional
players
in
the
american
power
establishment
they
nevertheless
are
something
of
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
they
have
a
lot
of
money
and
a
lot
of
friends
in
many
places
both
likely
and
unlikely
the
dead
may
be
known
for
environmentalist
rhetoric
but
this
hardly
makes
them
luddites
on
the
contrary
like
most
rock
musicians
the
grateful
dead
have
spent
their
entire
adult
lives
in
the
company
of
complex
electronic
equipment
they
have
funds
to
burn
on
any
sophisticated
tool
and
toy
that
might
happen
to
catch
their
fancy
and
their
fancy
is
quite
extensive
the
deadhead
community
boasts
any
number
of
recording
engineers
lighting
experts
rock
video
mavens
electronic
technicians
of
all
descriptions
and
the
drift
goes
both
ways
steve
wozniak
apple
used
to
throw
rock
festivals
silicon
valley
rocks
out
these
are
the
not
the
today
for
a
surprising
number
of
people
all
over
america
the
supposed
dividing
line
between
bohemian
and
technician
simply
no
longer
exists
people
of
this
sort
may
have
a
set
of
windchimes
and
a
dog
with
a
knotted
kerchief
its
neck
but
they
also
quite
likely
to
own
a
multimegabyte
macintosh
running
midi
synthesizer
software
and
trippy
fractal
simulations
these
days
even
timothy
leary
himself
prophet
of
lsd
does
demos
in
his
lecture
tours
john
perry
barlow
is
not
a
member
of
the
grateful
dead
he
is
however
a
ranking
deadhead
barlow
describes
himself
as
a
a
vague
term
like
social
activist
might
not
be
far
from
the
mark
either
but
barlow
might
be
better
described
as
a
poet
if
one
keeps
in
mind
percy
shelley
archaic
definition
of
poets
as
unacknowledged
legislators
of
the
world
barlow
once
made
a
stab
at
acknowledged
legislator
status
in
he
narrowly
missed
the
republican
nomination
for
a
seat
in
the
wyoming
state
senate
barlow
is
a
wyoming
native
the
scion
of
a
family
he
is
in
his
early
forties
married
and
the
father
of
three
daughters
barlow
is
not
much
troubled
by
other
people
narrow
notions
of
consistency
in
the
late
this
republican
rock
lyricist
cattle
rancher
sold
his
ranch
and
became
a
computer
telecommunications
devotee
the
barlow
made
this
transition
with
ease
he
genuinely
enjoyed
computers
with
a
beep
of
his
modem
he
leapt
from
pinedale
wyoming
into
electronic
contact
with
a
large
and
lively
crowd
of
bright
inventive
technological
sophisticates
from
all
over
the
world
barlow
found
the
social
milieu
of
computing
attractive
its
pace
its
rhetoric
its
barlow
began
dabbling
in
computer
journalism
with
marked
success
as
he
was
a
quick
study
and
both
shrewd
and
eloquent
he
frequently
travelled
to
san
francisco
to
network
with
deadhead
friends
there
barlow
made
extensive
contacts
throughout
the
californian
computer
community
including
friendships
among
the
wilder
spirits
at
apple
in
may
barlow
received
a
visit
from
a
local
wyoming
agent
of
the
fbi
the
nuprometheus
case
had
reached
wyoming
barlow
was
troubled
to
find
himself
under
investigation
in
an
area
of
his
interests
once
quite
free
of
federal
attention
he
had
to
struggle
to
explain
the
very
nature
of
to
a
headscratching
local
fbi
man
who
specialized
in
barlow
chatting
helpfully
and
demonstrating
the
wonders
of
his
modem
to
the
puzzled
fed
was
alarmed
to
find
all
hackers
generally
under
fbi
suspicion
as
an
evil
influence
in
the
electronic
community
the
fbi
in
pursuit
of
a
hacker
called
nuprometheus
were
tracing
attendees
of
a
suspect
group
called
the
hackers
conference
the
hackers
conference
which
had
been
started
in
was
a
yearly
californian
meeting
of
digital
pioneers
and
enthusiasts
the
hackers
of
the
hackers
conference
had
little
if
anything
to
do
with
the
hackers
of
the
digital
underground
on
the
contrary
the
hackers
of
this
conference
were
mostly
californian
ceos
consultants
journalists
and
entrepreneurs
this
group
of
hackers
were
the
exact
sort
of
hackers
most
likely
to
react
with
militant
fury
at
any
criminal
degradation
of
the
term
hacker
barlow
though
he
was
not
arrested
or
accused
of
a
crime
and
though
his
computer
had
certainly
not
gone
out
the
door
was
very
troubled
by
this
anomaly
he
carried
the
word
to
the
well
like
the
hackers
conference
the
well
was
an
emanation
of
the
point
foundation
point
foundation
the
inspiration
of
a
wealthy
californian
radical
named
stewart
brand
was
to
be
a
major
of
the
civil
libertarian
effort
point
foundation
cultural
efforts
like
those
of
their
fellow
bay
area
californians
the
grateful
dead
were
multifaceted
and
multitudinous
rigid
ideological
consistency
had
never
been
a
strong
suit
of
the
whole
earth
catalog
this
point
publication
had
enjoyed
a
strong
vogue
during
the
late
and
early
when
it
offered
hundreds
of
practical
and
not
so
practical
tips
on
communitarian
living
environmentalism
and
getting
the
whole
earth
catalog
and
its
sequels
sold
two
and
half
million
copies
and
won
a
national
book
award
with
the
slow
collapse
of
american
radical
dissent
the
whole
earth
catalog
had
slipped
to
a
more
modest
corner
of
the
cultural
radar
but
in
its
magazine
incarnation
coevolution
quarterly
the
point
foundation
continued
to
offer
a
magpie
potpourri
of
access
to
tools
and
ideas
coevolution
quarterly
which
started
in
was
never
a
widely
popular
magazine
despite
periodic
outbreaks
of
millenarian
fervor
coevolution
quarterly
failed
to
revolutionize
western
civilization
and
replace
leaden
centuries
of
history
with
bright
new
californian
paradigms
instead
this
propaganda
arm
of
point
foundation
cakewalked
a
fine
line
between
impressive
brilliance
and
new
age
flakiness
coevolution
quarterly
carried
no
advertising
cost
a
lot
and
came
out
on
cheap
newsprint
with
modest
graphics
it
was
poorly
distributed
and
spread
mostly
by
subscription
and
word
of
mouth
it
could
not
seem
to
grow
beyond
subscribers
and
yet
it
never
seemed
to
shrink
much
either
year
in
year
out
decade
in
decade
out
some
strange
demographic
minority
accreted
to
support
the
magazine
the
enthusiastic
readership
did
not
seem
to
have
much
in
the
way
of
coherent
politics
or
ideals
it
was
sometimes
hard
to
understand
what
held
them
together
if
the
often
bitter
debate
in
the
could
be
described
as
togetherness
but
if
the
magazine
did
not
flourish
it
was
resilient
it
got
by
then
in
the
of
the
macintosh
computer
coevolution
quarterly
suddenly
hit
the
rapids
point
foundation
had
discovered
the
computer
revolution
out
came
the
whole
earth
software
catalog
of
arousing
headscratching
doubts
among
the
faithful
and
rabid
enthusiasm
among
the
nascent
cyberpunk
milieu
present
company
included
point
foundation
started
its
yearly
hackers
conference
and
began
to
take
an
extensive
interest
in
the
strange
new
possibilities
of
digital
counterculture
coevolution
quarterlyfolded
its
teepee
replaced
by
whole

review
and
eventually
by
whole
earth
review
the
magazine
present
incarnation
currently
under
the
editorship
of
maven
howard
rheingold
saw
the
birth
of
the
well
the
whole
earth
link
the
well
was
point
foundation
bulletin
board
system
as
boards
went
the
well
was
an
anomaly
from
the
beginning
and
remained
one
it
was
local
to
san
francisco
it
was
huge
with
multiple
phonelines
and
enormous
files
of
commentary
its
complex
software
might
be
most
charitably
described
as
it
was
run
on
a
mainframe
out
of
the
rambling
offices
of
a
cultural
foundation
in
sausalito
and
it
was
crammed
with
fans
of
the
grateful
dead
though
the
well
was
peopled
by
chattering
hipsters
of
the
bay
area
counterculture
it
was
by
no
means
a
digital
underground
board
teenagers
were
fairly
scarce
most
well
users
known
as
wellbeings
were
and
baby
boomers
they
tended
to
work
in
the
information
industry
hardware
software
telecommunications
media
entertainment
librarians
academics
and
journalists
were
especially
common
on
the
well
attracted
by
point
distribution
of
tools
and
ideas
there
were
no
anarchy
files
on
the
well
scarcely
a
dropped
hint
about
access
codes
or
theft
no
one
used
handles
vicious
were
held
to
a
comparatively
civilized
rumble
debates
were
sometimes
sharp
but
no
wellbeing
ever
claimed
that
a
rival
had
disconnected
his
phone
trashed
his
house
or
posted
his
credit
card
numbers
the
well
grew
slowly
as
the
advanced
it
charged
a
modest
sum
for
access
and
storage
and
lost
money
for
years
but
not
enough
to
hamper
the
point
foundation
which
was
nonprofit
anyway
by
the
well
had
about
five
thousand
users
these
users
wandered
about
a
gigantic
cyberspace
smorgasbord
of
conferences
each
conference
itself
consisting
of
a
welter
of
topics
each
topic
containing
dozens
sometimes
hundreds
of
comments
in
a
tumbling
multiperson
debate
that
could
last
for
months

a

a

milieu
of
hawaiian
holistic
photographers
trading
confessions
with

tibetans
but
this
confusion
is
more
apparent
than
real
each
of
these
conferences
was
a
little
cyberspace
world
in
itself
comprising
dozens
and
perhaps
hundreds
of
each
conference
was
commonly
frequented
by
a
fairly
small
fairly
community
of
perhaps
a
few
dozen
people
it
was
humanly
impossible
to
encompass
the
entire
well
especially
since
access
to
the
well
mainframe
computer
was
billed
by
the
hour
most
users
contented
themselves
with
a
few
favorite
topical
neighborhoods
with
the
occasional
foray
elsewhere
for
a
taste
of
exotica
but
especially
important
news
items
and
hot
topical
debates
could
catch
the
attention
of
the
entire
well
community
like
any
community
the
well
had
its
celebrities
and
john
perry
barlow
the
and
lyricist
of
the
grateful
dead
ranked
prominently
among
them
it
was
here
on
the
well
that
barlow
posted
his
tale
of
encounter
with
the
fbi
the
story
as
might
be
expected
created
a
great
stir
the
well
was
already
primed
for
hacker
controversy
in
december
harper
magazine
had
hosted
a
debate
on
the
well
about
the
ethics
of
illicit
computer
intrusion
while
over
forty
various
took
part
barlow
proved
a
star
in
the
debate
so
did
acid
phreak
and
phiber
optik
a
pair
of
young
new
york
whose
skills
at
telco
intrusion
were
matched
only
by
their
apparently
limitless
hunger
for
fame
the
advent
of
these
two
boldly
swaggering
outlaws
in
the
precincts
of
the
well
created
a
sensation
akin
to
that
of
black
panthers
at
a
cocktail
party
for
the
radically
chic
phiber
optik
in
particular
was
to
seize
the
day
in
a
devotee
of
the
circle
and
stalwart
of
the
new
york
hackers
group
masters
of
deception
phiber
optik
was
a
splendid
exemplar
of
the
computer
intruder
as
committed
dissident
the
optik
a
dropout
and
computer
repairman
was
young
smart
and
ruthlessly
obsessive
a
digital
dude
who
was
utterly
and
airily
contemptuous
of
anyone
rules
but
his
own
by
late
phiber
optik
had
appeared
in
harper
esquire
the
new
york
times
in
countless
public
debates
and
conventions
even
on
a
television
show
hosted
by
geraldo
rivera
treated
with
gingerly
respect
by
barlow
and
other
well
mavens
phiber
optik
swiftly
became
a
well
celebrity
strangely
despite
his
thorny
attitude
and
utter
phiber
optik
seemed
to
arouse
strong
protective
instincts
in
most
of
the
people
who
met
him
he
was
great
copy
for
journalists
always
fearlessly
ready
to
swagger
and
better
yet
to
actually
demonstrate
some
digital
stunt
he
was
a
born
media
darling
even
cops
seemed
to
recognize
that
there
was
something
peculiarly
unworldly
and
uncriminal
about
this
particular
troublemaker
he
was
so
bold
so
flagrant
so
young
and
so
obviously
doomed
that
even
those
who
strongly
disapproved
of
his
actions
grew
anxious
for
his
welfare
and
began
to
flutter
about
him
as
if
he
were
an
endangered
seal
pup
in
january
nine
days
after
the
martin
luther
king
day
crash
phiber
optik
acid
phreak
and
a
third
nyc
scofflaw
named
scorpion
were
raided
by
the
secret
service
their
computers
went
out
the
door
along
with
the
usual
blizzard
of
papers
notebooks
compact
disks
answering
machines
sony
walkmans
etc
both
acid
phreak
and
phiber
optik
were
accused
of
having
caused
the
crash
the
mills
of
justice
ground
slowly
the
case
eventually
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
new
york
state
police
phiber
had
lost
his
machinery
in
the
raid
but
there
were
no
charges
filed
against
him
for
over
a
year
his
predicament
was
extensively
publicized
on
the
well
where
it
caused
much
resentment
for
police
tactics
it
one
thing
to
merely
hear
about
a
hacker
raided
or
busted
it
another
to
see
the
police
attacking
someone
you
come
to
know
personally
and
who
has
explained
his
motives
at
length
through
the
harper
debate
on
the
well
it
had
become
clear
to
the
wellbeings
that
phiber
optik
was
not
in
fact
going
to
hurt
anything
in
their
own
salad
days
many
wellbeings
had
tasted
in
pitched
with
police
they
were
inclined
to
indulgence
for
acts
of
civil
disobedience
wellbeings
were
also
startled
to
learn
of
the
draconian
thoroughness
of
a
typical
hacker
it
took
no
great
stretch
of
imagination
for
them
to
envision
themselves
suffering
much
the
same
treatment
as
early
as
january
sentiment
on
the
well
had
already
begun
to
sour
and
people
had
begun
to
grumble
that
hackers
were
getting
a
raw
deal
from
the
the
resultant
issue
of
magazine
posed
the
question
as
to
whether
was
a
crime
at
all
as
barlow
put
it
later
i
begun
to
wonder
if
we
also
regard
spelunkers
as
desperate
criminals
if
at
t
owned
all
the
caves
in
february
more
than
a
year
after
the
raid
on
his
home
phiber
optik
was
finally
arrested
and
was
charged
with
computer
tampering
and
computer
trespass
new
york
state
offenses
he
was
also
charged
with
a
misdemeanor
involving
a
complex
scam
to
a
number
phiber
optik
pled
guilty
to
the
misdemeanor
charge
and
was
sentenced
to
hours
of
community
service
this
passing
harassment
from
the
unfathomable
world
of
straight
people
seemed
to
bother
optik
himself
little
if
at
all
deprived
of
his
computer
by
the
january
he
simply
bought
himself
a
portable
computer
so
the
cops
could
no
longer
monitor
the
phone
where
he
lived
with
his
mom
and
he
went
right
on
with
his
depredations
sometimes
on
live
radio
or
in
front
of
television
cameras
the
crackdown
raid
may
have
done
little
to
dissuade
phiber
optik
but
its
galling
affect
on
the
wellbeings
was
profound
as
rolled
on
the
slings
and
arrows
mounted
the
knight
lightning
raid
the
steve
jackson
raid
the
operation
sundevil
the
rhetoric
of
law
enforcement
made
it
clear
that
there
was
in
fact
a
concerted
crackdown
on
hackers
in
progress
the
hackers
of
the
hackers
conference
the
wellbeings
and
their
ilk
did
not
really
mind
the
occasional
public
misapprehension
of
hacking
if
anything
this
membrane
of
differentiation
from
straight
society
made
the
computer
community
feel
different
smarter
better
they
had
never
before
been
confronted
however
by
a
concerted
vilification
campaign
barlow
central
role
in
the
was
one
of
the
major
anomalies
of
journalists
investigating
the
controversy
often
stumbled
over
the
truth
about
barlow
but
they
commonly
dusted
themselves
off
and
hurried
on
as
if
nothing
had
happened
it
was
as
if
it
were
too
much
to
believe
that
a
freak
from
the
grateful
dead
had
taken
on
a
federal
law
enforcement
operation
and
actually
seemed
to
be
winning
barlow
had
no
easily
detectable
for
a
political
struggle
of
this
kind
he
had
no
formal
legal
or
technical
credentials
barlow
was
however
a
computer
networker
of
truly
stellar
brilliance
he
had
a
poet
gift
of
concise
colorful
phrasing
he
also
had
a
journalist
shrewdness
an
wit
and
a
phenomenal
wealth
of
simple
personal
charm
the
kind
of
influence
barlow
possessed
is
fairly
common
currency
in
literary
artistic
or
musical
circles
a
gifted
critic
can
wield
great
artistic
influence
simply
through
defining
the
temper
of
the
times
by
coining
the
and
the
terms
of
debate
that
become
the
common
currency
of
the
period
and
as
it
happened
barlow
was
a
art
critic
with
a
special
fondness
for
the
western
art
of
frederic
remington
barlow
was
the
first
commentator
to
adopt
william
striking
term
cyberspace
as
a
synonym
for
the
nexus
of
computer
and
telecommunications
networks
barlow
was
insistent
that
cyberspace
should
be
regarded
as
a
qualitatively
new
world
a
frontier
according
to
barlow
the
world
of
electronic
communications
now
made
visible
through
the
computer
screen
could
no
longer
be
usefully
regarded
as
just
a
tangle
of
wiring
instead
it
had
become
a
place
cyberspace
which
demanded
a
new
set
of
metaphors
a
new
set
of
rules
and
behaviors
the
term
as
barlow
employed
it
struck
a
useful
chord
and
this
concept
of
cyberspace
was
picked
up
by
time
scientific
american
computer
police
hackers
and
even
constitutional
scholars
cyberspace
now
seems
likely
to
become
a
permanent
fixture
of
the
language
barlow
was
very
striking
in
person
a
tall
bearded
wyomingan
in
a
dashing
western
ensemble
of
jeans
jacket
cowboy
boots
a
knotted
and
an
grateful
dead
cloisonne
lapel
pin
armed
with
a
modem
however
barlow
was
truly
in
his
element
formal
hierarchies
were
not
barlow
strong
suit
he
rarely
missed
a
chance
to
belittle
the
large
organizations
and
their
drones
with
their
uptight
institutional
mindset
barlow
was
very
much
of
the
persuasion
deeply
unimpressed
by
and
but
when
it
came
to
the
digital
grapevine
barlow
was
a
cyberspace
par
excellence
there
was
not
a
mighty
army
of
barlows
there
was
only
one
barlow
and
he
was
a
fairly
anomolous
individual
however
the
situation
only
seemed
to
require
a
single
barlow
in
fact
after
many
people
must
have
concluded
that
a
single
barlow
was
far
more
than
they
ever
bargained
for
barlow
querulous
about
his
encounter
with
the
fbi
struck
a
strong
chord
on
the
well
a
number
of
other
free
spirits
on
the
fringes
of
apple
computing
had
come
under
suspicion
and
they
liked
it
not
one
whit
better
than
he
did
one
of
these
was
mitchell
kapor
the
of
the
spreadsheet
program
lotus
and
the
founder
of
lotus
development
corporation
kapor
had
the
passing
indignity
of
being
fingerprinted
down
at
his
own
local
boston
fbi
headquarters
but
barlow
post
made
the
full
national
scope
of
the
fbi
dragnet
clear
to
kapor
the
issue
now
had
kapor
full
attention
as
the
secret
service
swung
into
operation
nationwide
in
kapor
watched
every
move
with
deep
skepticism
and
growing
alarm
as
it
happened
kapor
had
already
met
barlow
who
had
interviewed
kapor
for
a
california
computer
journal
like
most
people
who
met
barlow
kapor
had
been
very
taken
with
him
now
kapor
took
it
upon
himself
to
drop
in
on
barlow
for
a
talk
about
the
situation
kapor
was
a
regular
on
the
well
kapor
had
been
a
devotee
of
the
whole
earth
catalogsince
the
beginning
and
treasured
a
complete
run
of
the
magazine
and
kapor
not
only
had
a
modem
but
a
private
jet
in
pursuit
of
the
scattered
investments
of
kapor
enterprises
his
personal
dollar
holding
company
kapor
commonly
crossed
state
lines
with
about
as
much
thought
as
one
might
give
to
faxing
a
letter
the
council
of
june
in
pinedale
wyoming
was
the
start
of
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
barlow
swiftly
wrote
a
manifesto
crime
and
puzzlement
which
announced
his
and
kapor
intention
to
form
a
political
organization
to
raise
and
disburse
funds
for
education
lobbying
and
litigation
in
the
areas
relating
to
digital
speech
and
the
extension
of
the
constitution
into
cyberspace
furthermore
proclaimed
the
manifesto
the
foundation
would
fund
conduct
and
support
legal
efforts
to
demonstrate
that
the
secret
service
has
exercised
prior
restraint
on
publications
limited
free
speech
conducted
improper
seizure
of
equipment
and
data
used
undue
force
and
generally
conducted
itself
in
a
fashion
which
is
arbitrary
oppressive
and
unconstitutional
crime
and
puzzlement
was
distributed
far
and
wide
through
computer
networking
channels
and
also
printed
in
the
whole
earth
review
the
sudden
declaration
of
a
coherent
politicized
from
the
ranks
of
hackerdom
electrified
the
community
steve
wozniak
perhaps
a
bit
stung
by
the
nuprometheus
scandal
swiftly
offered
to
match
any
funds
kapor
offered
the
foundation
john
gilmore
one
of
the
pioneers
of

immediately
offered
his
own
extensive
financial
and
personal

gilmore

to
prove
an
eloquent

of
electronic

especially

was
declared
the
home
of
the
electronic

foundation
press
coverage
was
immediate
and
intense
like
their
spiritual
ancestors
alexander
graham

and
thomas
watson
the
computer
entrepreneurs
of

and
people
such
as
wozniak
jobs
kapor
gates
and
ross
perot
who
had
raised
themselves
by
their
bootstraps
to
dominate
a
glittering
new
industry
had
always
made
very
good
copy
but
while
the
wellbeings
rejoiced
the
press
in
general
seemed
nonplussed
by
the
civilizers
of
cyberspace
eff
insistence
that
the
war
against
hackers
involved
grave
constitutional
civil
liberties
issues
seemed
somewhat
farfetched
especially
since
none
of
eff
organizers
were
lawyers
or
established
politicians
the
business
press
in
particular
found
it
easier
to
seize
on
the
apparent
core
of
the
story
that
entrepreneur
mitchell
kapor
had
established
a
defense
fund
for
hackers
was
eff
a
genuinely
important
political
development
or
merely
a
clique
of
wealthy
eccentrics
dabbling
in
matters
better
left
to
the
proper
authorities
the
jury
was
still
out
but
the
stage
was
now
set
for
open
confrontation
and
the
first
and
the
most
critical
battle
was
the
hacker
of
knight
lightning
it
has
been
my
practice
throughout
this
book
to
refer
to
hackers
only
by
their
handles
there
is
little
to
gain
by
giving
the
real
names
of
these
people
many
of
whom
are
juveniles
many
of
whom
have
never
been
convicted
of
any
crime
and
many
of
whom
had
unsuspecting
parents
who
have
already
suffered
enough
but
the
trial
of
knight
lightning
on
july
made
this
particular
hacker
a
nationally
known
public
figure
it
can
do
no
particular
harm
to
himself
or
his
family
if
i
repeat
the
fact
that
his
name
is
craig
neidorf
pronounced
neidorf
jury
trial
took
place
in
the
united
states
district
court
northern
district
of
illinois
eastern
division
with
the
honorable
nicholas
bua
presiding
the
united
states
of
america
was
the
plaintiff
the
defendant
neidorf
the
defendant
attorney
was
sheldon
zenner
of
the
chicago
firm
of
katten
muchin
and
zavis
the
prosecution
was
led
by
the
stalwarts
of
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
william
cook
colleen
coughlin
and
david
glockner
all
assistant
united
states
attorneys
the
secret
service
case
agent
was
timothy
foley
it
will
be
recalled
that
neidorf
was
the
of
an
underground
hacker
magazine
called
phrack
phrack
was
an
entirely
electronic
publication
distributed
through
bulletin
boards
and
over
electronic
networks
it
was
amateur
publication
given
away
for
free
neidorf
had
never
made
any
money
for
his
work
in
phrack
neither
had
his
unindicted
taran
king
or
any
of
the
numerous
phrack
contributors
the
chicago
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
however
had
decided
to
prosecute
neidorf
as
a
fraudster
to
formally
admit
that
phrack
was
a
magazine
and
neidorf
a
publisher
was
to
open
a
prosecutorial
pandora
box
of
first
amendment
issues
to
do
this
was
to
play
into
the
hands
of
zenner
and
his
eff
advisers
which
now
included
a
phalanx
of
prominent
new
york
civil
rights
lawyers
as
well
as
the
formidable
legal
staff
of
katten
muchin
and
zavis
instead
the
prosecution
relied
heavily
on
the
issue
of
access
device
fraud
section
of
title
the
section
from
which
the
secret
service
drew
its
most
direct
jurisdiction
over
computer
crime
neidorf
alleged
crimes
centered
around
the
document
he
was
accused
of
having
entered
into
a
fraudulent
scheme
with
the
prophet
who
it
will
be
recalled
was
the
atlanta
lod
member
who
had
illicitly
copied
the
document
from
the
bellsouth
aimsx
system
the
prophet
himself
was
also
a
in
the
neidorf
case
of
the
alleged
fraud
scheme
to
steal
document
and
to
pass
the
document
across
state
lines
which
helped
establish
the
neidorf
trial
as
a
federal
case
the
prophet
in
the
spirit
of
full
had
agreed
to
testify
against
neidorf
in
fact
all
three
of
the
atlanta
crew
stood
ready
to
testify
against
neidorf
their
own
federal
prosecutors
in
atlanta
had
charged
the
atlanta
three
with
a
conspiracy
b
computer
fraud
c
wire
fraud
d
access
device
fraud
and
e
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
property
title
sections
and
faced
with
this
blizzard
of
trouble
prophet
and
leftist
had
ducked
any
public
trial
and
had
pled
guilty
to
reduced
charges
one
conspiracy
count
apiece
urvile
had
pled
guilty
to
that
odd
bit
of
section
which
makes
it
illegal
to
possess
fifteen
or
more
illegal
access
devices
in
his
case
computer
passwords
and
their
sentences
were
scheduled
for
september
well
after
the
neidorf
trial
as
witnesses
they
could
presumably
be
relied
upon
to
behave
neidorf
however
was
pleading
innocent
most
everyone
else
caught
up
in
the
crackdown
had
cooperated
fully
and
pled
guilty
in
hope
of
reduced
sentences
steve
jackson
was
a
notable
exception
of
course
and
had
strongly
protested
his
innocence
from
the
very
beginning
but
steve
jackson
could
not
get
a
day
in
court
steve
jackson
had
never
been
charged
with
any
crime
in
the
first
place
neidorf
had
been
urged
to
plead
guilty
but
neidorf
was
a
political
science
major
and
was
disinclined
to
go
to
jail
for
fraud
when
he
had
not
made
any
money
had
not
broken
into
any
computer
and
had
been
publishing
a
magazine
that
he
considered
protected
under
the
first
amendment
neidorf
trial
was
the
only
legal
action
of
the
entire
crackdown
that
actually
involved
bringing
the
issues
at
hand
out
for
a
public
test
in
front
of
a
jury
of
american
citizens
neidorf
too
had
cooperated
with
investigators
he
had
voluntarily
handed
over
much
of
the
evidence
that
had
led
to
his
own
indictment
he
had
already
admitted
in
writing
that
he
knew
that
the
document
had
been
stolen
before
he
had
published
it
in
phrack
or
from
the
prosecution
point
of
view
illegally
transported
stolen
property
by
wire
in
something
purporting
to
be
a
publication
but
even
if
the
publication
of
the
document
was
not
held
to
be
a
crime
that
would
let
neidorf
off
the
hook
neidorf
had
still
received
the
document
when
prophet
had
transferred
it
to
him
from
rich
jolnet
node
on
that
occasion
it
certainly
had
been
published
it
was
hacker
booty
pure
and
simple
transported
across
state
lines
the
chicago
task
force
led
a
chicago
grand
jury
to
indict
neidorf
on
a
set
of
charges
that
could
have
put
him
in
jail
for
thirty
years
when
some
of
these
charges
were
successfully
challenged
before
neidorf
actually
went
to
trial
the
chicago
task
force
rearranged
his
indictment
so
that
he
faced
a
possible
jail
term
of
over
sixty
years
as
a
first
offender
it
was
very
unlikely
that
neidorf
would
in
fact
receive
a
sentence
so
drastic
but
the
chicago
task
force
clearly
intended
to
see
neidorf
put
in
prison
and
his
conspiratorial
magazine
put
permanently
out
of
commission
this
was
a
federal
case
and
neidorf
was
charged
with
the
fraudulent
theft
of
property
worth
almost
eighty
thousand
dollars
william
cook
was
a
strong
believer
in
prosecutions
with
symbolic
overtones
he
often
published
articles
on
his
work
in
the
security
trade
press
arguing
that
a
clear
message
had
to
be
sent
to
the
public
at
large
and
the
computer
community
in
particular
that
unauthorized
attacks
on
computers
and
the
theft
of
computerized
information
would
not
be
tolerated
by
the
courts
the
issues
were
complex
the
prosecution
tactics
somewhat
unorthodox
but
the
chicago
task
force
had
proved
to
date
shadowhawk
had
been
bagged
on
the
wing
in
by
the
task
force
and
sentenced
to
nine
months
in
prison
and
a
fine
the
shadowhawk
case
involved
charges
under
section
the
federal
interest
computer
section
shadowhawk
had
not
in
fact
been
a
devotee
of
computers
per
se
on
the
contrary
shadowhawk
who
owned
an
at
t
home
computer
seemed
to
cherish
a
special
aggression
toward
at
t
he
had
bragged
on
the
underground
boards
phreak
klass
and
ripco
of
his
skills
at
raiding
at
t
and
of
his
intention
to
crash
at
t
national
phone
system
shadowhawk
brags
were
noticed
by
henry
kluepfel
of
bellcore
security
scourge
of
the
outlaw
boards
whose
relations
with
the
chicago
task
force
were
long
and
intimate
the
task
force
successfully
established
that
section
applied
to
the
teenage
shadowhawk
despite
the
objections
of
his
defense
attorney
shadowhawk
had
entered
a
computer
owned
by
missile
command
and
merely
managed
by
at
t
he
had
also
entered
an
at
t
computer
located
at
robbins
air
force
base
in
georgia
attacking
at
t
was
of
federal
interest
whether
shadowhawk
had
intended
it
or
not
the
task
force
also
convinced
the
court
that
a
piece
of
at
t
software
that
shadowhawk
had
illicitly
copied
from
bell
labs
the
artificial
intelligence
expert
system
was
worth
a
cool
one
million
dollars
shadowhawk
attorney
had
argued
that
shadowhawk
had
not
sold
the
program
and
had
made
no
profit
from
the
illicit
copying
and
in
point
of
fact
the
expert
system
was
experimental
software
and
had
no
established
market
value
because
it
had
never
been
on
the
market
in
the
first
place
at
t
own
assessment
of
a
one
million
dollar
figure
for
its
own
intangible
property
was
accepted
without
challenge
by
the
court
however
and
the
court
concurred
with
the
government
prosecutors
that
shadowhawk
showed
clear
intent
to
defraud
whether
he
gotten
any
money
or
not
shadowhawk
went
to
jail
the
task
force
other
triumph
had
been
the
conviction
and
jailing
of
kyrie
kyrie
a
true
denizen
of
the
digital
criminal
underground
was
a
canadian
woman
convicted
and
jailed
for
telecommunications
fraud
in
canada
after
her
release
from
prison
she
had
fled
the
wrath
of
canada
bell
and
the
royal
canadian
mounted
police
and
eventually
settled
very
unwisely
in
chicago
kyrie
who
also
called
herself
long
distance
information
specialized
in
abuse
she
assembled
large
numbers
of
hot
codes
then
read
them
aloud
into
a
series
of
corporate
systems
kyrie
and
her
friends
were
electronic
squatters
in
corporate
systems
using
them
much
as
if
they
were
pirate
bulletin
boards
then
moving
on
when
their
vocal
chatter
clogged
the
system
and
the
owners
necessarily
wised
up
kyrie
camp
followers
were
a
loose
tribe
of
some
hundred
and
fifty
who
followed
her
trail
of
piracy
from
machine
to
machine
ardently
begging
for
her
services
and
expertise
kyrie
disciples
passed
her
stolen
numbers
in
exchange
for
her
stolen
long
distance
information
some
of
kyrie
clients
paid
her
off
in
cash
by
scamming
cash
advances
from
western
union
kyrie
travelled
incessantly
mostly
through
airline
tickets
and
hotel
rooms
that
she
scammed
through
stolen
credit
cards
tiring
of
this
she
found
refuge
with
a
fellow
female
phone
phreak
in
chicago
kyrie
hostess
like
a
surprising
number
of
phone
phreaks
was
blind
she
was
also
physically
disabled
kyrie
allegedly
made
the
best
of
her
new
situation
by
applying
for
and
receiving
state
welfare
funds
under
a
false
identity
as
a
qualified
caretaker
for
the
handicapped
sadly
kyrie
two
children
by
a
former
marriage
had
also
vanished
underground
with
her
these
digital
refugees
had
no
legal
american
identity
and
had
never
spent
a
day
in
school
kyrie
was
addicted
to
technical
mastery
and
enthralled
by
her
own
cleverness
and
the
ardent
worship
of
her
teenage
followers
this
foolishly
led
her
to
phone
up
gail
thackeray
in
arizona
to
boast
brag
strut
and
offer
to
play
informant
thackeray
however
had
already
learned
far
more
than
enough
about
kyrie
whom
she
roundly
despised
as
an
adult
criminal
corrupting
minors
a
female
fagin
thackeray
passed
her
tapes
of
kyrie
boasts
to
the
secret
service
kyrie
was
raided
and
arrested
in
chicago
in
may
she
confessed
at
great
length
and
pled
guilty
in
august
cook
and
his
task
force
colleague
colleen
coughlin
sent
kyrie
to
jail
for
months
for
computer
and
telecommunications
fraud
this
was
a
markedly
severe
sentence
by
the
usual
standards
of
hacker
busts
seven
of
kyrie
foremost
teenage
disciples
were
also
indicted
and
convicted
the
kyrie
street
gang
as
cook
described
it
had
been
crushed
cook
and
his
colleagues
had
been
the
first
ever
to
put
someone
in
prison
for
abuse
their
pioneering
efforts
had
won
them
attention
and
kudos
in
his
article
on
kyrie
cook
drove
the
message
home
to
the
readers
of
security
management
magazine
a
trade
journal
for
corporate
security
professionals
the
case
cook
said
and
kyrie
stiff
sentence
reflect
a
new
reality
for
hackers
and
computer
crime
victims
in
the
individuals
and
corporations
who
report
computer
and
telecommunications
crimes
can
now
expect
that
their
cooperation
with
federal
law
enforcement
will
result
in
meaningful
punishment
companies
and
the
public
at
large
must
report
crimes
if
they
want
prosecutors
and
the
course
to
protect
their
rights
to
the
tangible
and
intangible
property
developed
and
stored
on
computers
cook
had
made
it
his
business
to
construct
this
new
reality
for
hackers
he
also
made
it
his
business
to
police
corporate
property
rights
to
the
intangible
had
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
been
a
hacker
defense
fund
as
that
term
was
generally
understood
they
presumably
would
have
stood
up
for
kyrie
her
sentence
did
indeed
send
a
message
that
federal
heat
was
coming
down
on
hackers
but
kyrie
found
no
defenders
at
eff
or
anywhere
else
for
that
matter
eff
was
not
a
fund
for
electronic
crooks
the
neidorf
case
paralleled
the
shadowhawk
case
in
certain
ways
the
victim
once
again
was
allowed
to
set
the
value
of
the
stolen
property
once
again
kluepfel
was
both
investigator
and
technical
advisor
once
again
no
money
had
changed
hands
but
the
intent
to
defraud
was
central
the
prosecution
case
showed
signs
of
weakness
early
on
the
task
force
had
originally
hoped
to
prove
neidorf
the
center
of
a
nationwide
legion
of
doom
criminal
conspiracy
the
phrack
editors
threw
physical
every
summer
which
attracted
hackers
from
across
the
country
generally
two
dozen
or
so
of
the
magazine
favorite
contributors
and
readers
such
conventions
were
common
in
the
hacker
community
magazine
for
instance
held
public
meetings
of
hackers
in
new
york
every
month
lod
were
always
a
strong
presence
at
these
summercons
in
july
an
arizona
hacker
named
dictator
attended
summercon
in
neidorf
home
town
of
louis
dictator
was
one
of
gail
underground
informants
dictator
underground
board
in
phoenix
was
a
sting
operation
for
the
secret
service
dictator
brought
an
undercover
crew
of
secret
service
agents
to
summercon
the
agents
bored
spyholes
through
the
wall
of
dictator
hotel
room
in
st
louis
and
videotaped
the
frolicking
hackers
through
a
mirror
as
it
happened
however
nothing
illegal
had
occurred
on
videotape
other
than
the
guzzling
of
beer
by
a
couple
of
minors
summercons
were
social
events
not
sinister
cabals
the
tapes
showed
fifteen
hours
of
raucous
laughter
and
neidorf
lawyer
sheldon
zenner
saw
the
secret
service
tapes
before
the
trial
zenner
was
shocked
by
the
complete
harmlessness
of
this
meeting
which
cook
had
earlier
characterized
as
a
sinister
interstate
conspiracy
to
commit
fraud
zenner
wanted
to
show
the
summercon
tapes
to
the
jury
it
took
protracted
maneuverings
by
the
task
force
to
keep
the
tapes
from
the
jury
as
irrelevant
the
document
was
also
proving
a
weak
reed
it
had
originally
been
valued
at
unlike
shadowhawk
arcane
artificial
intelligence
booty
the
document
was
not
software
it
was
written
in
english
people
found
this
value
for
a
bureaucratic
document
frankly
incredible
in
his
crime
and
puzzlement
manifesto
for
eff
barlow
commented
we
will
probably
never
know
how
this
figure
was
reached
or
by
whom
though
i
like
to
imagine
an
appraisal
team
consisting
of
franz
kafka
joseph
heller
and
thomas
pynchon
as
it
happened
barlow
was
unduly
pessimistic
the
eff
did
in
fact
eventually
discover
exactly
how
this
figure
was
reached
and
by
whom
but
only
in
long
after
the
neidorf
trial
was
over
kim
megahee
a
southern
bell
security
manager
had
arrived
at
the
document
value
by
simply
adding
up
the
costs
associated
with
the
production
of
the
document
those
costs
were
as
follows
a
technical
writer
had
been
hired
to
research
and
write
the
document
hours
of
work
at
an
hour
cost
a
project
manager
had
overseen
the
technical
writer
hours
at
an
hour
made
a
week
of
typing
had
cost
dollars
a
week
of
formatting
had
cost
a
week
of
graphics
formatting
had
cost
two
days
of
editing
cost
a
box
of
order
labels
cost
five
dollars
preparing
a
purchase
order
for
the
document
including
typing
and
the
obtaining
of
an
authorizing
signature
from
within
the
bellsouth
bureaucracy
cost
printing
cost
mailing
the
document
to
fifty
people
took
fifty
hours
by
a
clerk
and
cost
placing
the
document
in
an
index
took
two
clerks
an
hour
each
totalling
bureaucratic
overhead
alone
therefore
was
alleged
to
have
cost
a
whopping
according
to
megahee
the
typing
of
a
document
had
taken
a
full
week
writing
it
had
taken
five
weeks
including
an
overseer
who
apparently
did
nothing
else
but
watch
the
author
for
five
weeks
editing
twelve
pages
had
taken
two
days
printing
and
mailing
an
electronic
document
which
was
already
available
on
the
southern
bell
data
network
to
any
telco
employee
who
needed
it
had
cost
over
a
thousand
dollars
but
this
was
just
the
beginning
there
were
also
the
hardware
expenses
eight
hundred
fifty
dollars
for
a
computer
monitor
thousand
dollars
for
a
sophisticated
vaxstation
ii
computer
six
thousand
dollars
for
a
computer
printer
thousand
dollars
for
a
copy
of
interleaf
software
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
for
vms
software
all
this
to
create
the
document
plus
ten
percent
of
the
cost
of
the
software
and
the
hardware
for
maintenance
actually
the
ten
percent
maintenance
costs
though
mentioned
had
been
left
off
the
final
total
apparently
through
a
merciful
oversight
megahee
letter
had
been
mailed
directly
to
william
cook
himself
at
the
office
of
the
chicago
federal
attorneys
the
united
states
government
accepted
these
telco
figures
without
question
as
incredulity
mounted
the
value
of
the
document
was
officially
revised
downward
this
time
robert
kibler
of
bellsouth
security
estimated
the
value
of
the
twelve
pages
as
a
mere
based
purportedly
on
r
d
costs
but
this
specific
estimate
right
down
to
the
nickel
did
not
move
the
skeptics
at
all
in
fact
it
provoked
open
scorn
and
a
torrent
of
sarcasm
the
financial
issues
concerning
theft
of
proprietary
information
have
always
been
peculiar
it
could
be
argued
that
bellsouth
had
not
lost
its
document
at
all
in
the
first
place
and
therefore
had
not
suffered
any
monetary
damage
from
this
theft
and
sheldon
zenner
did
in
fact
argue
this
at
neidorf
trial
that
prophet
raid
had
not
been
theft
but
was
better
understood
as
illicit
copying
the
money
however
was
not
central
to
anyone
true
purposes
in
this
trial
it
was
not
cook
strategy
to
convince
the
jury
that
the
document
was
a
major
act
of
theft
and
should
be
punished
for
that
reason
alone
his
strategy
was
to
argue
that
the
document
was
dangerous
it
was
his
intention
to
establish
that
the
document
was
a
to
the
enhanced
system
neidorf
had
deliberately
and
recklessly
distributed
a
dangerous
weapon
neidorf
and
the
prophet
did
not
care
or
perhaps
even
gloated
at
the
sinister
idea
that
the
document
could
be
used
by
hackers
to
disrupt
service
a
life
line
for
every
person
certainly
in
the
southern
bell
region
of
the
united
states
and
indeed
in
many
communities
throughout
the
united
states
in
cook
own
words
neidorf
had
put
people
lives
in
danger
in
maneuverings
cook
had
established
that
the
document
was
too
hot
to
appear
in
the
public
proceedings
of
the
neidorf
trial
the
jury
itself
would
not
be
allowed
to
ever
see
this
document
lest
it
slip
into
the
official
court
records
and
thus
into
the
hands
of
the
general
public
and
thus
somehow
to
malicious
hackers
who
might
lethally
abuse
it
hiding
the
document
from
the
jury
may
have
been
a
clever
legal
maneuver
but
it
had
a
severe
flaw
there
were
in
point
of
fact
hundreds
perhaps
thousands
of
people
already
in
possession
of
the
document
just
as
phrack
had
published
it
its
true
nature
was
already
obvious
to
a
wide
section
of
the
interested
public
all
of
whom
by
the
way
were
at
least
theoretically
party
to
a
gigantic
conspiracy
most
everyone
in
the
electronic
community
who
had
a
modem
and
any
interest
in
the
neidorf
case
already
had
a
copy
of
the
document
it
had
already
been
available
in
phrack
for
over
a
year
people
even
quite
normal
people
without
any
particular
prurient
interest
in
forbidden
knowledge
did
not
shut
their
eyes
in
terror
at
the
thought
of
beholding
a
dangerous
document
from
a
telephone
company
on
the
contrary
they
tended
to
trust
their
own
judgement
and
simply
read
the
document
for
themselves
and
they
were
not
impressed
one
such
person
was
john
nagle
nagle
was
a
professional
programmer
with
a
masters
degree
in
computer
science
from
stanford
he
had
worked
for
ford
aerospace
where
he
had
invented
a
technique
known
as
the
nagle
algorithm
and
for
the
prominent
californian
firm
autodesk
where
he
was
a
major
stockholder
nagle
was
also
a
prominent
figure
on
the
well
much
respected
for
his
technical
knowledgeability
nagle
had
followed
the
debate
closely
for
he
was
an
ardent
telecommunicator
he
was
no
particular
friend
of
computer
intruders
but
he
believed
electronic
publishing
had
a
great
deal
to
offer
society
at
large
and
attempts
to
restrain
its
growth
or
to
censor
free
electronic
expression
strongly
roused
his
ire
the
neidorf
case
and
the
document
were
both
being
discussed
in
detail
on
the
internet
in
an
electronic
publication
called
telecom
digest
nagle
a
longtime
internet
maven
was
a
regular
reader
of
telecom
digest
nagle
had
never
seen
a
copy
of
phrack
but
the
implications
of
the
case
disturbed
him
while
in
a
stanford
bookstore
hunting
books
on
robotics
nagle
happened
across
a
book
called
the
intelligent
network
thumbing
through
it
at
random
nagle
came
across
an
entire
chapter
meticulously
detailing
the
workings
of
police
emergency
systems
this
extensive
text
was
being
sold
openly
and
yet
in
illinois
a
young
man
was
in
danger
of
going
to
prison
for
publishing
a
thin
document
about
service
nagle
made
an
ironic
comment
to
this
effect
in
telecom
digest
from
there
nagle
was
put
in
touch
with
mitch
kapor
and
then
with
neidorf
lawyers
sheldon
zenner
was
delighted
to
find
a
computer
telecommunications
expert
willing
to
speak
up
for
neidorf
one
who
was
not
a
wacky
teenage
hacker
nagle
was
fluent
mature
and
respectable
he
once
had
a
federal
security
clearance
nagle
was
asked
to
fly
to
illinois
to
join
the
defense
team
having
joined
the
defense
as
an
expert
witness
nagle
read
the
entire
document
for
himself
he
made
his
own
judgement
about
its
potential
for
menace
the
time
has
now
come
for
you
yourself
the
reader
to
have
a
look
at
the
document
this
piece
of
work
was
the
pretext
for
a
federal
prosecution
that
could
have
sent
an
electronic
publisher
to
prison
for
thirty
or
even
sixty
years
it
was
the
pretext
for
the
search
and
seizure
of
steve
jackson
games
a
legitimate
publisher
of
printed
books
it
was
also
the
formal
pretext
for
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
mentor
bulletin
board
phoenix
project
and
for
the
raid
on
the
home
of
erik
bloodaxe
it
also
had
much
to
do
with
the
seizure
of
richard
andrews
jolnet
node
and
the
shutdown
of
charles
boykin
at
t
node
the
document
was
the
single
most
important
piece
of
evidence
in
the
hacker
crackdown

john

of

little
of
interest
to
anyone
who
is
not
a

of

with
the

itself
to

however
exactly
as
it
was
published
in
its
edited
form
in
phrack
the
reader
may
be
able
to
verify
a
few
statements
of
fact
about
its
nature
first
there
is
no
software
no
computer
code
in
the
document
it
is
not
language
like
fortran
or
it
is
english
all
the
sentences
have
nouns
and
verbs
and
punctuation
it
does
not
explain
how
to
break
into
the
system
it
does
not
suggest
ways
to
destroy
or
damage
the
system
there
are
no
access
codes
in
the
document
there
are
no
computer
passwords
it
does
not
explain
how
to
steal
long
distance
service
it
does
not
explain
how
to
break
in
to
telco
switching
stations
there
is
nothing
in
it
about
using
a
personal
computer
or
a
modem
for
any
purpose
at
all
good
or
bad
close
study
will
reveal
that
this
document
is
not
about
machinery
the
document
is
about
administration
it
describes
how
one
creates
and
administers
certain
units
of
telco
bureaucracy
special
service
centers
and
major
account
centers
it
describes
how
these
centers
should
distribute
responsibility
for
the
service
to
other
units
of
telco
bureaucracy
in
a
chain
of
command
a
formal
hierarchy
it
describes
who
answers
customer
complaints
who
screens
calls
who
reports
equipment
failures
who
answers
those
reports
who
handles
maintenance
who
chairs
subcommittees
who
gives
orders
who
follows
orders
who
tells
whom
what
to
do
the
document
is
not
a
roadmap
to
computers
the
document
is
a
roadmap
to
people
as
an
aid
to
breaking
into
computer
systems
the
document
is
useless
as
an
aid
to
harassing
and
deceiving
telco
people
however
the
document
might
prove
handy
especially
with
its
glossary
which
i
have
not
included
an
intense
and
protracted
study
of
this
document
and
its
glossary
combined
with
many
other
such
documents
might
teach
one
to
speak
like
a
telco
employee
and
telco
people
live
by
speech
they
live
by
phone
communication
if
you
can
mimic
their
language
over
the
phone
you
can
them
if
you
can
con
telco
people
you
can
wreak
havoc
among
them
you
can
force
them
to
no
longer
trust
one
another
you
can
break
the
telephonic
ties
that
bind
their
community
you
can
make
them
paranoid
and
people
will
fight
harder
to
defend
their
community
than
they
will
fight
to
defend
their
individual
selves
this
was
the
genuine
threat
posed
by
phrack
magazine
the
real
struggle
was
over
the
control
of
telco
language
the
control
of
telco
knowledge
it
was
a
struggle
to
defend
the
social
membrane
of
differentiation
that
forms
the
walls
of
the
telco
community
ivory
tower
the
special
jargon
that
allows
telco
professionals
to
recognize
one
another
and
to
exclude
charlatans
thieves
and
upstarts
and
the
prosecution
brought
out
this
fact
they
repeatedly
made
reference
to
the
threat
posed
to
telco
professionals
by
hackers
using
social
engineering
however
craig
neidorf
was
not
on
trial
for
learning
to
speak
like
a
professional
telecommunications
expert
craig
neidorf
was
on
trial
for
access
device
fraud
and
transportation
of
stolen
property
he
was
on
trial
for
stealing
a
document
that
was
purportedly
highly
sensitive
and
purportedly
worth
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
john
nagle
read
the
document
he
drew
his
own
conclusions
and
he
presented
zenner
and
his
defense
team
with
an
overflowing
box
of
similar
material
drawn
mostly
from
stanford
engineering
libraries
during
the
trial
the
defense
team
zenner
other
attorneys
nagle
neidorf
and
expert
dorothy
denning
all
pored
over
the
document
on
the
afternoon
of
july
zenner
began
to
a
woman
named
billie
williams
a
service
manager
for
southern
bell
in
atlanta
williams
had
been
responsible
for
the
document
she
was
not
its
author
its
original
author
was
a
southern
bell
staff
manager
named
richard
helms
however
helms
should
not
bear
the
entire
blame
many
telco
staff
people
and
maintenance
personnel
had
amended
the
document
it
had
not
been
so
much
written
by
a
single
author
as
built
by
committee
out
of
of
jargon
williams
had
been
called
as
a
witness
for
the
prosecution
and
had
gamely
tried
to
explain
the
basic
technical
structure
of
the
system
aided
by
charts
now
it
was
zenner
turn
he
first
established
that
the
proprietary
stamp
that
bellsouth
had
used
on
the
document
was
stamped
on
every
single
document
that
bellsouth
wrote
thousands
of
documents
we
do
not
publish
anything
other
than
for
our
own
company
williams
explained
any
company
document
of
this
nature
is
considered
proprietary
nobody
was
in
charge
of
singling
out
special
publications
for
special
protection
they
were
all
special
no
matter
how
trivial
no
matter
what
their
subject
matter
the
stamp
was
put
on
as
soon
as
any
document
was
written
and
the
stamp
was
never
removed
zenner
now
asked
whether
the
charts
she
had
been
using
to
explain
the
mechanics
of
system
were
proprietary
too
were
they
public
information
these
charts
all
about
psaps
alis
nodes
local
end
switches
could
he
take
the
charts
out
in
the
street
and
show
them
to
anybody
without
violating
some
proprietary
notion
that
bellsouth
has
ms
williams
showed
some
confusion
but
finally
areed
that
the
charts
were
in
fact
public
but
is
this
what
you
said
was
basically
what
appeared
in
phrack
williams
denied
this
zenner
now
pointed
out
that
the
document
as
published
in
phrack
was
only
half
the
size
of
the
original
document
as
prophet
had
purloined
it
half
of
it
had
been
deleted
edited
by
neidorf
williams
countered
that
most
of
the
information
that
is
in
the
text
file
is
redundant
zenner
continued
to
probe
exactly
what
bits
of
knowledge
in
the
document
were
in
fact
unknown
to
the
public
locations
of
computers
phone
numbers
for
telco
personnel
ongoing
maintenance
subcommittees
had
neidorf
removed
much
of
this
then
he
pounced
are
you
familiar
with
bellcore
technical
reference
document
it
was
zenner
explained
officially
titled
public
safety
answering
point
interface
between
switch
and
customer
premises
equipment
it
contained
highly
detailed
and
specific
technical
information
about
the
system
it
was
published
by
bellcore
and
publicly
available
for
about
he
showed
the
witness
a
bellcore
catalog
which
listed
thousands
of
documents
from
bellcore
and
from
all
the
baby
bells
bellsouth
included
the
catalog
zenner
pointed
out
was
free
anyone
with
a
credit
card
could
call
the
bellcore
number
and
simply
order
any
of
these
documents
which
would
be
shipped
to
any
customer
without
question
including
for
instance
bellsouth
service
interfaces
to
customer
premises
equipment
at
a
public
safety
answering
point
zenner
gave
the
witness
a
copy
of
bellsouth
service
interfaces
which
cost
as
he
pointed
out
straight
from
the
catalog
look
at
it
carefully
he
urged
williams
and
tell
me
if
it
does
contain
about
twice
as
much
detailed
information
about
the
system
of
bellsouth
than
appeared
anywhere
in
phrack
you
want
me
to
williams
trailed
off
i
do
understand
take
a
careful
look
zenner
persisted
take
a
look
at
that
document
and
tell
me
when
you
done
looking
at
it
if
indeed
it
does
contain
much
more
detailed
information
about
the
system
than
appeared
in
phrack
phrack
was
taken
from
this
williams
said
excuse
me
said
zenner
phrack
was
taken
from
this
i
ca
hear
you
zenner
said
phrack
was
not
taken
from
this
document
i
do
understand
your
question
to
me
i
guess
you
do
zenner
said
at
this
point
the
prosecution
case
had
been
gutshot
williams
was
distressed
her
confusion
was
quite
genuine
phrack
had
not
been
taken
from
any
publicly
available
bellcore
document
phrack
document
had
been
stolen
from
her
own
company
computers
from
her
own
company
text
files
that
her
own
colleagues
had
written
and
revised
with
much
labor
but
the
value
of
the
document
had
been
blown
to
smithereens
it
was
worth
eighty
grand
according
to
bellcore
it
was
worth
thirteen
bucks
and
the
looming
menace
that
it
supposedly
posed
had
been
reduced
in
instants
to
a
scarecrow
bellcore
itself
was
selling
material
far
more
detailed
and
dangerous
to
anybody
with
a
credit
card
and
a
phone
actually
bellcore
was
not
giving
this
information
to
just
anybody
they
gave
it
to
anybody
who
asked
but
not
many
did
ask
not
many
people
knew
that
bellcore
had
a
free
catalog
and
an
number
john
nagle
knew
but
certainly
the
average
teenage
phreak
did
know
tuc
a
friend
of
neidorf
and
sometime
phrack
contributor
knew
and
tuc
had
been
very
helpful
to
the
defense
behind
the
scenes
but
the
legion
of
doom
did
know
otherwise
they
would
never
have
wasted
so
much
time
raiding
dumpsters
cook
did
know
foley
did
know
kluepfel
did
know
the
right
hand
of
bellcore
knew
not
what
the
left
hand
was
doing
the
right
hand
was
battering
hackers
without
mercy
while
the
left
hand
was
distributing
bellcore
intellectual
property
to
anybody
who
was
interested
in
telephone
technical
trivia
apparently
a
pathetic
few
the
digital
underground
was
so
amateurish
and
poorly
organized
that
they
had
never
discovered
this
heap
of
unguarded
riches
the
ivory
tower
of
the
telcos
was
so
in
the
fog
of
its
own
technical
obscurity
that
it
had
left
all
the
windows
open
and
flung
open
the
doors
no
one
had
even
noticed
zenner
sank
another
nail
in
the
coffin
he
produced
a
printed
issue
of
telephone
engineer
management
a
prominent
industry
journal
that
comes
out
twice
a
month
and
costs
a
year
this
particular
issue
of
te
m
called
update
on
featured
a
galaxy
of
technical
details
on
service
and
a
glossary
far
more
extensive
than
phrack
the
trial
rumbled
on
somehow
through
its
own
momentum
tim
foley
testified
about
his
interrogations
of
neidorf
neidorf
written
admission
that
he
had
known
the
document
was
pilfered
was
officially
read
into
the
court
record
an
interesting
side
issue
came
up
terminus
had
once
passed
neidorf
a
piece
of
unix
at
t
software
a
sequence
that
had
been
cunningly
altered
so
that
it
could
trap
passwords
the
unix
software
itself
was
illegally
copied
at
t
property
and
the
alterations
terminus
had
made
to
it
had
transformed
it
into
a
device
for
facilitating
computer
terminus
himself
would
eventually
plead
guilty
to
theft
of
this
piece
of
software
and
the
chicago
group
would
send
terminus
to
prison
for
it
but
it
was
of
dubious
relevance
in
the
neidorf
case
neidorf
had
written
the
program
he
was
accused
of
ever
having
used
it
and
neidorf
was
being
charged
with
software
theft
or
owning
a
password
trapper
on
the
next
day
zenner
took
the
offensive
the
civil
libertarians
now
had
their
own
arcane
untried
legal
weaponry
to
launch
into
action
the
electronic
communications
privacy
act
of
us
code
section
et
seq
section
makes
it
a
crime
to
intentionally
access
without
authorization
a
facility
in
which
an
electronic
communication
service
is
provided
it
is
at
heart
an
and
law
intended
to
carry
the
traditional
protections
of
telephones
into
other
electronic
channels
of
communication
while
providing
penalties
for
amateur
snoops
however
section
of
the
ecpa
also
lays
some
formal
difficulties
on
the
bugging
and
tapping
activities
of
police
the
secret
service
in
the
person
of
tim
foley
had
served
richard
andrews
with
a
federal
grand
jury
subpoena
in
their
pursuit
of
prophet
the
document
and
the
terminus
software
ring
but
according
to
the
electronic
communications
privacy
act
a
provider
of
remote
computing
service
was
legally
entitled
to
prior
notice
from
the
government
if
a
subpoena
was
used
richard
andrews
and
his
basement
unix
node
jolnet
had
not
received
any
prior
notice
tim
foley
had
purportedly
violated
the
ecpa
and
committed
an
electronic
crime
zenner
now
sought
the
judge
permission
to
foley
on
the
topic
of
foley
own
electronic
misdeeds
cook
argued
that
richard
andrews
jolnet
was
a
privately
owned
bulletin
board
and
not
within
the
purview
of
ecpa
judge
bua
granted
the
motion
of
the
government
to
prevent
on
that
point
and
zenner
offensive
fizzled
this
however
was
the
first
direct
assault
on
the
legality
of
the
actions
of
the
computer
fraud
and
abuse
task
force
itself
the
first
suggestion
that
they
themselves
had
broken
the
law
and
might
perhaps
be
called
to
account
zenner
in
any
case
did
not
really
need
the
ecpa
instead
he
grilled
foley
on
the
glaring
contradictions
in
the
supposed
value
of
the
document
he
also
brought
up
the
embarrassing
fact
that
the
supposedly
document
had
been
sitting
around
for
months
in
jolnet
with
kluepfel
knowledge
while
kluepfel
had
done
nothing
about
it
in
the
afternoon
the
prophet
was
brought
in
to
testify
for
the
prosecution
the
prophet
it
will
be
recalled
had
also
been
indicted
in
the
case
as
partner
in
a
fraud
scheme
with
neidorf
in
atlanta
the
prophet
had
already
pled
guilty
to
one
charge
of
conspiracy
one
charge
of
wire
fraud
and
one
charge
of
interstate
transportation
of
stolen
property
the
wire
fraud
charge
and
the
stolen
property
charge
were
both
directly
based
on
the
document
the
prophet
proved
a
sorry
customer
answering
questions
politely
but
in
a
barely
audible
mumble
his
voice
trailing
off
at
the
ends
of
sentences
he
was
constantly
urged
to
speak
up
cook
examining
prophet
forced
him
to
admit
that
he
had
once
had
a
drug
problem
abusing
amphetamines
marijuana
cocaine
and
lsd
this
may
have
established
to
the
jury
that
hackers
are
or
can
be
seedy
lowlife
characters
but
it
may
have
damaged
prophet
credibility
somewhat
zenner
later
suggested
that
drugs
might
have
damaged
prophet
memory
the
interesting
fact
also
surfaced
that
prophet
had
never
physically
met
craig
neidorf
he
did
even
know
neidorf
last
name
at
least
not
until
the
trial
prophet
confirmed
the
basic
facts
of
his
hacker
career
he
was
a
member
of
the
legion
of
doom
he
had
abused
codes
he
had
broken
into
switching
stations
and
calls
he
had
hung
out
on
pirate
bulletin
boards
he
had
raided
the
bellsouth
aimsx
computer
copied
the
document
stored
it
on
jolnet
mailed
it
to
neidorf
he
and
neidorf
had
edited
it
and
neidorf
had
known
where
it
came
from
zenner
however
had
prophet
confirm
that
neidorf
was
not
a
member
of
the
legion
of
doom
and
had
not
urged
prophet
to
break
into
bellsouth
computers
neidorf
had
never
urged
prophet
to
defraud
anyone
or
to
steal
anything
prophet
also
admitted
that
he
had
never
known
neidorf
to
break
in
to
any
computer
prophet
said
that
no
one
in
the
legion
of
doom
considered
craig
neidorf
a
hacker
at
all
neidorf
was
not
a
unix
maven
and
simply
lacked
the
necessary
skill
and
ability
to
break
into
computers
neidorf
just
published
a
magazine
on
friday
july
the
case
against
neidorf
collapsed
cook
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
citing
information
currently
available
to
us
that
was
not
available
to
us
at
the
inception
of
the
trial
judge
bua
praised
the
prosecution
for
this
action
which
he
described
as
very
responsible
then
dismissed
a
juror
and
declared
a
mistrial
neidorf
was
a
free
man
his
defense
however
had
cost
himself
and
his
family
dearly
months
of
his
life
had
been
consumed
in
anguish
he
had
seen
his
closest
friends
shun
him
as
a
federal
criminal
he
owed
his
lawyers
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
despite
a
generous
payment
to
the
defense
by
mitch
kapor
neidorf
was
not
found
innocent
the
trial
was
simply
dropped
nevertheless
on
september
judge
bua
granted
motion
for
the
expungement
and
sealing
of
his
indictment
record
the
united
states
secret
service
was
ordered
to
delete
and
destroy
all
fingerprints
photographs
and
other
records
of
arrest
or
processing
relating
to
neidorf
indictment
including
their
paper
documents
and
their
computer
records
neidorf
went
back
to
school
blazingly
determined
to
become
a
lawyer
having
seen
the
justice
system
at
work
neidorf
lost
much
of
his
enthusiasm
for
merely
technical
power
at
this
writing
craig
neidorf
is
working
in
washington
as
a
salaried
researcher
for
the
american
civil
liberties
union
the
outcome
of
the
neidorf
trial
changed
the
eff
from
to
the
media
darlings
of
the
new
frontier
legally
speaking
the
neidorf
case
was
not
a
sweeping
triumph
for
anyone
concerned
no
constitutional
principles
had
been
established
the
issues
of
freedom
of
the
press
for
electronic
publishers
remained
in
legal
limbo
there
were
public
misconceptions
about
the
case
many
people
thought
neidorf
had
been
found
innocent
and
relieved
of
all
his
legal
debts
by
kapor
the
truth
was
that
the
government
had
simply
dropped
the
case
and
neidorf
family
had
gone
deeply
into
hock
to
support
him
but
the
neidorf
case
did
provide
a
single
devastating
public
the
feds
said
it
was
worth
eighty
grand
and
it
was
only
worth
thirteen
bucks
this
is
the
neidorf
case
single
most
memorable
element
no
serious
report
of
the
case
missed
this
particular
element
even
cops
could
not
read
this
without
a
wince
and
a
shake
of
the
head
it
left
the
public
credibility
of
the
crackdown
agents
in
tatters
the
crackdown
in
fact
continued
however
those
two
charges
against
prophet
which
had
been
based
on
the
document
were
quietly
forgotten
at
his
sentencing
even
though
prophet
had
already
pled
guilty
to
them
georgia
federal
prosecutors
strongly
argued
for
jail
time
for
the
atlanta
three
insisting
on
the
need
to
send
a
message
to
the
community
the
message
that
hackers
around
the
country
need
to
hear
there
was
a
great
deal
in
their
sentencing
memorandum
about
the
awful
things
that
various
other
hackers
had
done
though
the
atlanta
three
themselves
had
not
in
fact
actually
committed
these
crimes
there
was
also
much
speculation
about
the
awful
things
that
the
atlanta
three
might
have
done
and
were
capable
of
doing
even
though
they
had
not
in
fact
actually
done
them
the
prosecution
argument
carried
the
day
the
atlanta
three
were
sent
to
prison
urvile
and
leftist
both
got
months
each
while
prophet
a
second
offender
got
months
the
atlanta
three
were
also
assessed
staggering
fines
as
restitution
each
bellsouth
claimed
that
the
defendants
had
stolen
approximately
worth
of
proprietary
computer
access
information
specifically
worth
of
computer
passwords
and
connect
addresses
bellsouth
astonishing
claim
of
the
extreme
value
of
its
own
computer
passwords
and
addresses
was
accepted
at
face
value
by
the
georgia
court
furthermore
as
if
to
emphasize
its
theoretical
nature
this
enormous
sum
was
not
divvied
up
among
the
atlanta
three
but
each
of
them
had
to
pay
all
of
it
a
striking
aspect
of
the
sentence
was
that
the
atlanta
three
were
specifically
forbidden
to
use
computers
except
for
work
or
under
supervision
depriving
hackers
of
home
computers
and
modems
makes
some
sense
if
one
considers
hackers
as
computer
addicts
but
eff
filing
an
amicus
brief
in
the
case
protested
that
this
punishment
was
unconstitutional
it
deprived
the
atlanta
three
of
their
rights
of
free
association
and
free
expression
through
electronic
media
terminus
the
ultimate
hacker
was
finally
sent
to
prison
for
a
year
through
the
dogged
efforts
of
the
chicago
task
force
his
crime
to
which
he
pled
guilty
was
the
transfer
of
the
unix
password
trapper
which
was
officially
valued
by
at
t
at
a
figure
which
aroused
intense
skepticism
among
those
familiar
with
unix
programs
the
jailing
of
terminus
and
the
atlanta
legionnaires
of
doom
however
did
not
cause
the
eff
any
sense
of
embarrassment
or
defeat
on
the
contrary
the
civil
libertarians
were
rapidly
gathering
strength
an
early
and
potent
supporter
was
senator
patrick
leahy
democrat
from
vermont
who
had
been
a
senate
sponsor
of
the
electronic
communications
privacy
act
even
before
the
neidorf
trial
leahy
had
spoken
out
in
defense
of
and
freedom
of
the
keyboard
we
can
not
unduly
inhibit
the
inquisitive
who
if
left
to
experiment
today
may
tomorrow
develop
the
telecommunications
or
computer
technology
to
lead
the
united
states
into
the
century
he
represents
our
future
and
our
best
hope
to
remain
a
technologically
competitive
nation
it
was
a
handsome
statement
rendered
perhaps
rather
more
effective
by
the
fact
that
the
crackdown
raiders
did
not
have
any
senators
speaking
out
for
them
on
the
contrary
their
highly
secretive
actions
and
tactics
all
sealed
search
warrants
here
and
confidential
ongoing
investigations
there
might
have
won
them
a
burst
of
glamorous
publicity
at
first
but
were
crippling
them
in
the
propaganda
war
gail
thackeray
was
reduced
to
unsupported
bluster
some
of
these
people
who
are
loudest
on
the
bandwagon
may
just
slink
into
the
background
she
predicted
in
newsweek
when
all
the
facts
came
out
and
the
cops
were
vindicated
but
all
the
facts
did
not
come
out
those
facts
that
did
were
not
very
flattering
and
the
cops
were
not
vindicated
and
gail
thackeray
lost
her
job
by
the
end
of
william
cook
had
also
left
public
employment
had
belonged
to
the
crackdown
but
by
its
agents
were
in
severe
disarray
and
the
libertarians
were
on
a
roll
people
were
flocking
to
the
cause
a
particularly
interesting
ally
had
been
mike
godwin
of
austin
texas
godwin
was
an
individual
almost
as
difficult
to
describe
as
barlow
he
had
been
editor
of
the
student
newspaper
of
the
university
of
texas
and
a
computer
salesman
and
a
programmer
and
in
was
back
in
law
school
looking
for
a
law
degree
godwin
was
also
a
bulletin
board
maven
he
was
very
in
the
austin
board
community
under
his
handle
johnny
mnemonic
which
he
adopted
from
a
cyberpunk
science
fiction
story
by
william
gibson
godwin
was
an
ardent
cyberpunk
science
fiction
fan
as
a
fellow
austinite
of
similar
age
and
similar
interests
i
myself
had
known
godwin
socially
for
many
years
when
william
gibson
and
myself
had
been
writing
our
collaborative
sf
novel
the
difference
engine
godwin
had
been
our
technical
advisor
in
our
effort
to
link
our
apple
from
austin
to
vancouver
gibson
and
i
were
so
pleased
by
his
generous
expert
help
that
we
named
a
character
in
the
novel
michael
godwin
in
his
honor
the
handle
mnemonic
suited
godwin
very
well
his
erudition
and
his
mastery
of
trivia
were
impressive
to
the
point
of
stupor
his
ardent
curiosity
seemed
insatiable
and
his
desire
to
debate
and
argue
seemed
the
central
drive
of
his
life
godwin
had
even
started
his
own
austin
debating
society
wryly
known
as
the
dull
men
club
in
person
godwin
could
be
overwhelming
a
polymath
who
could
not
seem
to
let
any
idea
go
on
bulletin
boards
however
godwin
closely
reasoned
highly
grammatical
erudite
posts
suited
the
medium
well
and
he
became
a
local
board
celebrity
mike
godwin
was
the
man
most
responsible
for
the
public
national
exposure
of
the
steve
jackson
case
the
izenberg
seizure
in
austin
had
received
no
press
coverage
at
all
the
march
raids
on
mentor
bloodaxe
and
steve
jackson
games
had
received
a
brief
splash
in
the
front
page
of
the
austin
but
it
was
confused
and
the
warrants
were
sealed
and
the
secret
service
was
talking
steve
jackson
seemed
doomed
to
obscurity
jackson
had
not
been
arrested
he
was
not
charged
with
any
crime
he
was
not
on
trial
he
had
lost
some
computers
in
an
ongoing
investigation
so
what
jackson
tried
hard
to
attract
attention
to
the
true
extent
of
his
plight
but
he
was
drawing
a
blank
no
one
in
a
position
to
help
him
seemed
able
to
get
a
mental
grip
on
the
issues
godwin
however
was
uniquely
almost
magically
qualified
to
carry
jackson
case
to
the
outside
world
godwin
was
a
board
enthusiast
a
science
fiction
fan
a
former
journalist
a
computer
salesman
a
and
an
austinite
through
a
coincidence
yet
more
amazing
in
his
last
year
of
law
school
godwin
had
specialized
in
federal
prosecutions
and
criminal
procedure
acting
entirely
on
his
own
godwin
made
up
a
press
packet
which
summarized
the
issues
and
provided
useful
contacts
for
reporters
godwin
effort
which
he
carried
out
mostly
to
prove
a
point
in
a
local
board
debate
broke
the
story
again
in
the
austin
and
then
in
newsweek
life
was
never
the
same
for
mike
godwin
after
that
as
he
joined
the
growing
civil
liberties
debate
on
the
internet
it
was
obvious
to
all
parties
involved
that
here
was
one
guy
who
in
the
midst
of
complete
murk
and
confusion
genuinely
understood
everything
he
was
talking
about
the
disparate
elements
of
godwin
dilettantish
existence
suddenly
fell
together
as
neatly
as
the
facets
of
a
rubik
cube
when
the
time
came
to
hire
a
eff
staff
attorney
godwin
was
the
obvious
choice
he
took
the
texas
bar
exam
left
austin
moved
to
cambridge
became
a
professional
computer
civil
libertarian
and
was
soon
touring
the
nation
on
behalf
of
eff
delivering
addresses
on
the
issues
to
crowds
as
disparate
as
academics
industrialists
science
fiction
fans
and
federal
cops
michael
godwin
is
currently
the
chief
legal
counsel
of
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
in
cambridge
massachusetts
another
early
and
influential
participant
in
the
controversy
was
dorothy
denning
denning
was
unique
among
investigators
of
the
computer
underground
in
that
she
did
not
enter
the
debate
with
any
set
of
politicized
motives
she
was
a
professional
cryptographer
and
computer
security
expert
whose
primary
interest
in
hackers
was
scholarly
she
had
a
and
in
mathematics
and
a
in
computer
science
from
purdue
she
had
worked
for
sri
international
the
california
that
was
also
the
home
of
maven
donn
parker
and
had
authored
an
influential
text
called
cryptography
and
data
security
in
denning
was
working
for
digital
equipment
corporation
in
their
systems
reseach
center
her
husband
peter
denning
was
also
a
computer
security
expert
working
for
research
institute
for
advanced
computer
science
he
had
edited
the
computers
under
attack
intruders
worms
and
viruses
denning
took
it
upon
herself
to
contact
the
digital
underground
more
or
less
with
an
anthropological
interest
there
she
discovered
that
these
hackers
who
had
been
characterized
as
unethical
irresponsible
and
a
serious
danger
to
society
did
in
fact
have
their
own
subculture
and
their
own
rules
they
were
not
particularly
rules
but
they
were
in
fact
rules
basically
they
did
take
money
and
they
did
break
anything
her
dispassionate
reports
on
her
researches
did
a
great
deal
to
influence
computer
professionals
the
sort
of
people
who
merely
rolled
their
eyes
at
the
cyberspace
rhapsodies
of
a
john
perry
barlow
for
young
hackers
of
the
digital
underground
meeting
dorothy
denning
was
a
genuinely
experience
here
was
this
neatly
coiffed
conservatively
dressed
dainty
little
personage
who
reminded
most
hackers
of
their
moms
or
their
aunts
and
yet
she
was
an
ibm
systems
programmer
with
profound
expertise
in
computer
architectures
and
information
flow
who
had
personal
friends
in
the
fbi
and
the
national
security
agency
dorothy
denning
was
a
shining
example
of
the
american
mathematical
intelligentsia
a
genuinely
brilliant
person
from
the
central
ranks
of
the
elite
and
here
she
was
gently
questioning
over
the
deeper
ethical
implications
of
their
behavior
confronted
by
this
genuinely
nice
lady
most
hackers
sat
up
very
straight
and
did
their
best
to
keep
the
stuff
down
to
a
faint
whiff
of
brimstone
nevertheless
the
hackers
were
in
fact
prepared
to
seriously
discuss
serious
issues
with
dorothy
denning
they
were
willing
to
speak
the
unspeakable
and
defend
the
indefensible
to
blurt
out
their
convictions
that
information
can
not
be
owned
that
the
databases
of
governments
and
large
corporations
were
a
threat
to
the
rights
and
privacy
of
individuals
denning
articles
made
it
clear
to
many
that
hacking
was
not
simple
vandalism
by
some
evil
clique
of
psychotics
hacking
was
not
an
aberrant
menace
that
could
be
charmed
away
by
ignoring
it
or
swept
out
of
existence
by
jailing
a
few
ringleaders
instead
hacking
was
symptomatic
of
a
growing
primal
struggle
over
knowledge
and
power
in
the
age
of
information
denning
pointed
out
that
the
attitude
of
hackers
were
at
least
partially
shared
by
management
theorists
in
the
business
community
people
like
peter
drucker
and
tom
peters
peter
drucker
in
his
book
the
new
realities
had
stated
that
control
of
information
by
the
government
is
no
longer
possible
indeed
information
is
now
transnational
like
money
it
has
no
and
management
maven
tom
peters
had
chided
large
corporations
for
uptight
proprietary
attitudes
in
his
bestseller
thriving
on
chaos
information
hoarding
especially
by
politically
motivated
staffs
had
been
commonplace
throughout
american
industry
service
and
manufacturing
alike
it
will
be
an
impossible
millstone
aroung
the
neck
of
tomorrow
organizations
dorothy
denning
had
shattered
the
social
membrane
of
the
digital
underground
she
attended
the
neidorf
trial
where
she
was
prepared
to
testify
for
the
defense
as
an
expert
witness
she
was
a
organizer
of
two
of
the
most
important
national
meetings
of
the
computer
civil
libertarians
though
not
a
zealot
of
any
description
she
brought
disparate
elements
of
the
electronic
community
into
a
surprising
and
fruitful
collusion
dorothy
denning
is
currently
the
chair
of
the
computer
science
department
at
georgetown
university
in
washington
dc
there
were
many
stellar
figures
in
the
civil
libertarian
community
there
no
question
however
that
its
single
most
influential
figure
was
mitchell
kapor
other
people
might
have
formal
titles
or
governmental
positions
have
more
experience
with
crime
or
with
the
law
or
with
the
arcanities
of
computer
security
or
constitutional
theory
but
by
kapor
had
transcended
any
such
narrow
role
kapor
had
become
mitch
mitch
had
become
the
central
mitch
had
stood
up
first
he
had
spoken
out
loudly
directly
vigorously
and
angrily
he
had
put
his
own
reputation
and
his
very
considerable
personal
fortune
on
the
line
by
kapor
was
the
advocate
of
his
cause
and
was
known
personally
by
almost
every
single
human
being
in
america
with
any
direct
influence
on
the
question
of
civil
liberties
in
cyberspace
mitch
had
built
bridges
crossed
voids
changed
paradigms
forged
metaphors
made
and
swapped
business
cards
to
such
spectacular
effect
that
it
had
become
impossible
for
anyone
to
take
any
action
in
the
hacker
question
without
wondering
what
mitch
might
think
and
say
and
tell
his
friends
the
eff
had
simply
networked
the
situation
into
an
entirely
new
status
quo
and
in
fact
this
had
been
eff
deliberate
strategy
from
the
beginning
both
barlow
and
kapor
loathed
bureaucracies
and
had
deliberately
chosen
to
work
almost
entirely
through
the
electronic
spiderweb
of
valuable
personal
contacts
after
a
year
of
eff
both
barlow
and
kapor
had
every
reason
to
look
back
with
satisfaction
eff
had
established
its
own
internet
node
with
a
electronic
archive
of
documents
on
electronic
civil

privacy
issues
and
academic
freedom
eff
was
also
publishing
effector
a
quarterly
printed

as
well
as

online
an

with

and
eff
was
thriving
on
the
well
eff
had
a
national

in
cambridge
and
a

it
had
become
a

organization
and
was
attracting

it

also
attracted
the
support
of
some
thirty
lawyers

eager

lobbied
successfully
in
washington
and
in
massachusetts
to
change
state

federal
legislation
on

networking
kapor
in
particular
had
become
a
veteran
expert
witness
and
had
joined
the

telecommunications
board
of
the
national

of

eff
had
sponsored
meetings
such
as

freedom
and
privacy
and
the
cpsr
roundtable
it
had
carried
out
a
press
offensive
that
in
the
words
of
effector
has
affected
the
climate
of
opinion
about
computer
networking
and
begun
to
reverse
the
slide
into
hysteria
that
was
beginning
to
grip
the
nation
it
had
helped
craig
neidorf
avoid
prison
and
last
but
certainly
not

the

filed
a

personally
with

kapor
it

my
final
interview
for
this
book
the
city
of
boston
has
always
been
one
of
the
major
intellectual
centers
of
the
american
republic
it
is
a
very
old
city
by
american
standards
a
place
of

overshadowing
graveyards

the
companies

the
grace
of
old

the
uss
constitution
the
battle
of
bunker
hill
one
of
the
first
and
bitterest
armed
clashes
of
the
american
revolution
was
fought
in
boston
environs
today
there
is
a
monumental
spire
on
bunker
hill
visible
throughout
much
of
the
city
the
willingness
of
the
republican
revolutionaries
to
take
up
arms
and
fire
on
their
oppressors
has
left
a
cultural
legacy
that
two
full
centuries
have
not
effaced
bunker
hill
is
still
a
potent
center
of
american
political
symbolism
and
the
spirit
of
is
still
a
potent
image
for
those
who
seek
to
mold
public
opinion

not
everyone
who
wraps
himself
in
the

kapor
greets
me
cordially
in
his
own
office
down
a
hall
kapor
whose
name
is
pronounced
is
in
his
early
forties
married
and
the
father
of
two
he
has
a
round
face
high
forehead
straight
nose
a
slightly
tousled
mop
of
black
hair
peppered
with
gray
his
large
brown
eyes
are
wideset
reflective
one
might
almost
say
soulful
he
disdains
ties
and
commonly
wears
hawaiian
shirts
and
tropical
prints
not
so
much
garish
as
simply
cheerful
and
just
that
little
bit
anomalous
there
is
just
the
whiff
of
hacker
brimstone
about
mitch
kapor
he
may
not
have
the
charisma
of
his
wyoming
colleague
john
perry
barlow
but
something
about
the
guy
that
still
stops
one
short
he
has
the
air
of
the
eastern
city
dude
in
the
bowler
hat
the
dreamy
poker
shark
who
only
happens
to
know
the
exact
mathematical
odds
against
drawing
to
an
inside
straight
even
among
his
colleagues
who
are
hardly
known
for
mental
sluggishness
kapor
strikes
one
forcefully
as
a
very
intelligent
man
he
speaks
rapidly
with
vigorous
gestures
his
boston
accent
sometimes
slipping
to
the
sharp
nasal
tang
of
his
youth
in
long
island
kapor
whose
kapor
family
foundation
does
much
of
his
philanthropic
work
is
a
strong
supporter
of
boston
computer
museum
kapor
interest
in
the
history
of
his
industry
has
brought
him
some
remarkable
curios
such
as
the
byte
just
outside
his
office
door
this
byte
eight
digital
bits
has
been
salvaged
from
the
wreck
of
an
electronic
computer
of
the
age
it
a
standing
gunmetal
rack
about
the
size
of
a
small
with
eight
slots
of
breadboarding
featuring
vacuum
tubes
if
it
fell
off
a
table
it
could
easily
break
your
foot
but
it
was
computation
in
the
it
would
take
exactly
of
these
primordial
toasters
to
hold
the
first
part
of
this
book
there
also
a
coiling
multicolored
scaly
dragon
that
some
inspired
artist
has
cobbled
up
entirely
out
of
transistors
capacitors
and
brightly
wiring
inside
the
office
kapor
excuses
himself
briefly
to
do
a
little
housekeeping
on
his
personal
macintosh
iifx
if
its
giant
screen
were
an
open
window
an
agile
person
could
climb
through
it
without
much
trouble
at
all
there
a
at
kapor
elbow
a
memento
of
his
recent
trip
to
eastern
europe
which
has
a
stencilled
photo
and
the
legend
capitalist
fools
tour
it
kapor
barlow
and
two
california
luminaries
of
their
acquaintance
four
windblown
grinning
baby
boomer
dudes
in
leather
jackets
boots
denim
travel
bags
standing
on
airport
tarmac
somewhere
behind
the
formerly
iron
curtain
they
look
as
if
they
having
the
absolute
time
of
their
lives
kapor
is
in
a
reminiscent
mood
we
talk
a
bit
about
his
youth
high
school
days
as
a
math
nerd
saturdays
attending
columbia
science
honors
program
where
he
had
his
first
experience
programming
computers
ibm
in
and
i
was
very
interested
says
kapor
and
then
i
went
off
to
college
and
got
distracted
by
drugs
sex
and
rock
and
roll
like
anybody
with
half
a
brain
would
have
then
after
college
he
was
a
dj
in
hartford
connecticut
for
a
couple
of
years
i
ask
him
if
he
ever
misses
his
rock
and
roll
days
if
he
ever
wished
he
could
go
back
to
radio
work
he
shakes
his
head
flatly
i
stopped
thinking
about
going
back
to
be
a
dj
the
day
after
altamont
kapor
moved
to
boston
in
and
got
a
job
programming
mainframes
in
cobol
he
hated
it
he
quit
and
became
a
teacher
of
transcendental
meditation
it
was
kapor
long
flirtation
with
eastern
mysticism
that
gave
the
world
lotus
in
kapor
went
to
switzerland
where
the
transcendental
meditation
movement
had
rented
a
gigantic
victorian
hotel
in
it
was
an
group
a
hundred
and
twenty
of
them
determined
upon
enlightenment
or
bust
kapor
had
given
the
transcendant
his
best
shot
he
was
becoming
disenchanted
by
the
nuttiness
in
the
organization
they
were
teaching
people
to
levitate
he
says
staring
at
the
floor
his
voice
drops
an
octave
becomes
flat
they
do
levitate
kapor
chose
bust
he
went
back
to
the
states
and
acquired
a
degree
in
counselling
psychology
he
worked
a
while
in
a
hospital
could
stand
that
either
my
rep
was
he
says
a
very
bright
kid
with
a
lot
of
potential
who
has
found
himself
almost
thirty
sort
of
lost
kapor
was
unemployed
when
he
bought
his
first
personal
computer
an
apple
ii
he
sold
his
stereo
to
raise
cash
and
drove
to
new
hampshire
to
avoid
the
sales
tax
the
day
after
i
purchased
it
kapor
tells
me
i
was
hanging
out
in
a
computer
store
and
i
saw
another
guy
a
man
in
his
forties
guy
and
eavesdropped
on
his
conversation
with
the
salesman
he
did
know
anything
about
computers
i
had
a
year
programming
and
i
could
program
in
basic
i
taught
myself
so
i
went
up
to
him
and
i
actually
sold
myself
to
him
as
a
consultant
he
pauses
i
do
know
where
i
got
the
nerve
to
do
this
it
was
uncharacteristic
i
just
said
think
i
can
help
you
i
been
listening
this
is
what
you
need
to
do
and
i
think
i
can
do
it
for
you
and
he
took
me
on
he
was
my
first
client
i
became
a
computer
consultant
the
first
day
after
i
bought
the
apple
ii
kapor
had
found
his
true
vocation
he
attracted
more
clients
for
his
consultant
service
and
started
an
apple
users
group
a
friend
of
kapor
eric
rosenfeld
a
graduate
student
at
mit
had
a
problem
he
was
doing
a
thesis
on
an
arcane
form
of
financial
statistics
but
could
not
wedge
himself
into
the
crowded
queue
for
time
on
mit
mainframes
one
might
note
at
this
point
that
if
rosenfeld
had
dishonestly
broken
into
the
mit
mainframes
kapor
himself
might
have
never
invented
lotus
and
the
pc
business
might
have
been
set
back
for
years
eric
rosenfeld
did
have
an
apple
ii
however
and
he
thought
it
might
be
possible
to
scale
the
problem
down
kapor
as
favor
wrote
a
program
for
him
in
basic
that
did
the
job
it
then
occurred
to
the
two
of
them
out
of
the
blue
that
it
might
be
possible
to
sell
this
program
they
marketed
it
themselves
in
plastic
baggies
for
about
a
hundred
bucks
a
pop
mail
order
this
was
a
total
cottage
industry
by
a
marginal
consultant
kapor
says
proudly
that
how
i
got
started
honest
to
god
rosenfeld
who
later
became
a
very
prominent
figure
on
wall
street
urged
kapor
to
go
to
mit
business
school
for
an
mba
kapor
did
seven
months
there
but
never
got
his
mba
he
picked
up
some
useful
tools
mainly
a
firm
grasp
of
the
principles
of
accounting
and
in
his
own
words
learned
to
talk
mba
then
he
dropped
out
and
went
to
silicon
valley
the
inventors
of
visicalc
the
apple
computer
premier
business
program
had
shown
an
interest
in
mitch
kapor
kapor
worked
diligently
for
them
for
six
months
got
tired
of
california
and
went
back
to
boston
where
they
had
better
bookstores
the
visicalc
group
had
made
the
critical
error
of
bringing
in
professional
management
that
drove
them
into
the
ground
kapor
says
yeah
you
do
hear
a
lot
about
visicalc
these
days
i
muse
kapor
looks
surprised
well
lotus
we
bought
it
oh
you
bought
it
yeah
sort
of
like
the
bell
system
buying
western
union
kapor
grins
yep
yep
yeah
exactly
mitch
kapor
was
not
in
full
command
of
the
destiny
of
himself
or
his
industry
the
hottest
software
commodities
of
the
early
were
computer
games
the
atari
seemed
destined
to
enter
every
teenage
home
in
america
kapor
got
into
business
software
simply
because
he
did
have
any
particular
feeling
for
computer
games
but
he
was
supremely
fast
on
his
feet
open
to
new
ideas
and
inclined
to
trust
his
instincts
and
his
instincts
were
good
he
chose
good
people
to
deal
with
gifted
programmer
jonathan
sachs
the
of
lotus
financial
wizard
eric
rosenfeld
canny
wall
street
analyst
and
venture
capitalist
ben
rosen
kapor
was
the
founder
and
ceo
of
lotus
one
of
the
most
spectacularly
successful
business
ventures
of
the
later
twentieth
century
he
is
now
an
extremely
wealthy
man
i
ask
him
if
he
actually
knows
how
much
money
he
has
yeah
he
says
within
a
percent
or
two
how
much
does
he
actually
have
then
he
shakes
his
head
a
lot
a
lot
not
something
i
talk
about
issues
of
money
and
class
are
things
that
cut
pretty
close
to
the
bone
i
do
pry
it
beside
the
point
one
might
presume
impolitely
that
kapor
has
at
least
forty
million
that
what
he
got
the
year
he
left
lotus
people
who
ought
to
know
claim
kapor
has
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
million
give
or
take
a
market
swing
in
his
stock
holdings
if
kapor
had
stuck
with
lotus
as
his
colleague
friend
and
rival
bill
gates
has
stuck
with
his
own
software
microsoft
then
kapor
would
likely
have
much
the
same
fortune
gates
has
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
three
billion
give
or
take
a
few
hundred
million
mitch
kapor
has
all
the
money
he
wants
money
has
lost
whatever
charm
it
ever
held
for
him
probably
not
much
in
the
first
place
when
lotus
became
too
uptight
too
bureaucratic
too
far
from
the
true
sources
of
his
own
satisfaction
kapor
walked
he
simply
severed
all
connections
with
the
company
and
went
out
the
door
it
stunned
everyone
except
those
who
knew
him
best
kapor
has
not
had
to
strain
his
resources
to
wreak
a
thorough
transformation
in
cyberspace
politics
in
its
first
year
eff
budget
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
kapor
is
running
eff
out
of
his
pocket
change
kapor
takes
pains
to
tell
me
that
he
does
not
consider
himself
a
civil
libertarian
per
se
he
has
spent
quite
some
time
with
civil
libertarians
lately
and
there
a
to
them
that
bugs
him
they
seem
to
him
to
spend
entirely
too
much
time
in
legal
nitpicking
and
not
enough
vigorously
exercising
civil
rights
in
the
everyday
real
world
kapor
is
an
entrepreneur
like
all
hackers
he
prefers
his
involvements
direct
personal
and
the
fact
that
eff
has
a
node
on
the
internet
is
a
great
thing
we
a
publisher
we
a
distributor
of
information
among
the
items
the
internet
node
carries
is
back
issues
of
phrack
they
had
an
internal
debate
about
that
in
eff
and
finally
decided
to
take
the
plunge
they
might
carry
other
digital
underground
publications
but
if
they
do
he
says
we
certainly
carry
donn
parker
and
anything
gail
thackeray
wants
to
put
up
we
turn
it
into
a
public
library
that
has
the
whole
spectrum
of
use
evolve
in
the
direction
of
people
making
up
their
own
minds
he
grins
we
try
to
label
all
the
editorials
kapor
is
determined
to
tackle
the
technicalities
of
the
internet
in
the
service
of
the
public
interest
the
problem
with
being
a
node
on
the
net
today
is
that
you
got
to
have
a
captive
technical
specialist
we
have
chris
davis
around
for
the
care
and
feeding
of
the
balky
beast
we
could
do
it
ourselves
he
pauses
so
one
direction
in
which
technology
has
to
evolve
is
much
more
standardized
units
that
a
person
can
feel
comfortable
with
it
the
same
shift
as
from
minicomputers
to
pcs
i
can
see
a
future
in
which
any
person
can
have
a
node
on
the
net
any
person
can
be
a
publisher
it
better
than
the
media
we
now
have
it
possible
we
working
actively
kapor
is
in
his
element
now
fluent
thoroughly
in
command
in
his
material
you
go
tell
a
hardware
internet
hacker
that
everyone
should
have
a
node
on
the
net
he
says
and
the
first
thing
they
going
to
say
is
does
scale
ip
is
the
interface
protocol
for
the
internet
as
it
currently
exists
the
ip
software
is
simply
not
capable
of
indefinite
expansion
it
will
run
out
of
usable
addresses
it
will
saturate
the
answer
kapor
says
is
evolve
the
protocol
get
the
smart
people
together
and
figure
out
what
to
do
do
we
add
id
do
we
add
new
protocol
do
just
say
we
ca
do
it
getting
smart
people
together
to
figure
out
what
to
do
is
a
skill
at
which
kapor
clearly
excels
i
counter
that
people
on
the
internet
rather
enjoy
their
elite
technical
status
and
do
seem
particularly
anxious
to
democratize
the
net
kapor
agrees
with
a
show
of
scorn
i
tell
them
that
this
is
the
snobbery
of
the
people
on
the
mayflower
looking
down
their
noses
at
the
people
who
came
over
on
the
second
boat
just
because
they
got
here
a
year
or
five
years
or
ten
years
before
everybody
else
that
does
give
them
ownership
of
cyberspace
by
what
right
i
remark
that
the
telcos
are
an
electronic
network
too
and
they
seem
to
guard
their
specialized
knowledge
pretty
closely
kapor
ripostes
that
the
telcos
and
the
internet
are
entirely
different
animals
the
internet
is
an
open
system
everything
is
published
everything
gets
argued
about
basically
by
anybody
who
can
get
in
mostly
it
exclusive
and
elitist
just
because
it
so
difficult
let
make
it
easier
to
use
on
the
other
hand
he
allows
with
a
swift
change
of
emphasis
the
elitists
do
have
a
point
as
well
before
people
start
coming
in
who
are
new
who
want
to
make
suggestions
and
criticize
the
net
as
screwed
up
they
should
at
least
take
the
time
to
understand
the
culture
on
its
own
terms
it
has
its
own
history
show
some
respect
for
it
i
a
conservative
to
that
extent
the
internet
is
kapor
paradigm
for
the
future
of
telecommunications
the
internet
is
decentralized
almost
anarchic
there
are
no
bosses
no
chain
of
command
no
secret
data
if
each
node
obeys
the
general
interface
standards
there
simply
no
need
for
any
central
network
authority
would
that
spell
the
doom
of
at
t
as
an
institution
i
ask
that
prospect
does
faze
kapor
for
a
moment
their
big
advantage
that
they
have
now
is
that
they
have
all
of
the
wiring
but
two
things
are
happening
anyone
with
is
putting
down
fiber
southern
pacific
railroad
people
like
that
there
enormous
fiber
laid
in
dark
fiber
is
cable
whose
enormous
capacity
so
exceeds
the
demands
of
current
usage
that
much
of
the
fiber
still
has
no
on
it
it
still
awaiting
future
use
the
other
thing
that
happening
is
the
stuff
is
going
to
go
wireless
everyone
from
bellcore
to
the
cable
tv
companies
to
at
t
wants
to
put
in
these
things
called
communication
systems
so
you
could
have
local
competition
you
could
have
multiplicity
of
people
a
bunch
of
neighborhoods
sticking
stuff
up
on
poles
and
a
bunch
of
other
people
laying
in
dark
fiber
so
what
happens
to
the
telephone
companies
there
enormous
pressure
on
them
from
both
sides
the
more
i
look
at
this
the
more
i
believe
that
in
a
digital
world
the
idea
of
regulated
monopolies
is
bad
people
will
look
back
on
it
and
say
that
in
the
and
centuries
the
idea
of
public
utilities
was
an
okay
compromise
you
needed
one
set
of
wires
in
the
ground
it
was
too
economically
inefficient
otherwise
and
that
meant
one
entity
running
it
but
now
with
pieces
being
wireless
the
connections
are
going
to
be
via
interfaces
not
via
wires
i
mean
ultimately
there
are
going
to
be
wires
but
the
wires
are
just
a
commodity
fiber
wireless
you
no
longer
need
a
utility
water
utilities
gas
utilities
of
course
we
still
need
those
he
agrees
but
when
what
you
moving
is
information
instead
of
physical
substances
then
you
can
play
by
a
different
set
of
rules
we
evolving
those
rules
now
hopefully
you
can
have
a
much
more
decentralized
system
and
one
in
which
there
more
competition
in
the
marketplace
the
role
of
government
will
be
to
make
sure
that
nobody
cheats
the
proverbial
playing
field
a
policy
that
prevents
monopolization
it
should
result
in
better
service
lower
prices
more
choices
and
local
empowerment
he
smiles
i
very
big
on
local
empowerment
kapor
is
a
man
with
a
vision
it
a
very
novel
vision
which
he
and
his
allies
are
working
out
in
considerable
detail
and
with
great
energy
dark
cynical
morbid
cyberpunk
that
i
am
i
can
not
avoid
considering
some
of
the
darker
implications
of
decentralized
nonhierarchical
locally
empowered
networking
i
remark
that
some
pundits
have
suggested
that
electronic
networking
faxes
phones
photocopiers
played
a
strong
role
in
dissolving
the
power
of
centralized
communism
and
causing
the
collapse
of
the
warsaw
pact
socialism
is
totally
discredited
says
kapor
fresh
back
from
the
eastern
bloc
the
idea
that
faxes
did
it
all
by
themselves
is
rather
wishful
thinking
has
it
occurred
to
him
that
electronic
networking
might
corrode
america
industrial
and
political
infrastructure
to
the
point
where
the
whole
thing
becomes
untenable
unworkable
and
the
old
order
just
collapses
headlong
like
in
eastern
europe
no
kapor
says
flatly
i
think
that
extraordinarily
unlikely
in
part
because
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
i
had
similar
hopes
about
personal
computers
which
utterly
failed
to
materialize
he
grins
wryly
then
his
eyes
narrow
i
very
opposed
to
every
time
i
see
one
i
either
run
away
or
try
to
kill
it
it
dawns
on
me
then
that
mitch
kapor
is
not
trying
to
make
the
world
safe
for
democracy
he
certainly
is
not
trying
to
make
it
safe
for
anarchists
or
utopians
least
of
all
for
computer
intruders
or
electronic
artists
what
he
really
hopes
to
do
is
make
the
world
safe
for
future
mitch
kapors
this
world
of
decentralized
nodes
with
instant
global
access
for
the
best
and
brightest
would
be
a
perfect
milieu
for
the
shoestring
attic
capitalism
that
made
mitch
kapor
what
he
is
today
kapor
is
a
very
bright
man
he
has
a
rare
combination
of
visionary
intensity
with
a
strong
practical
streak
the

john
barlow
jerry

of

steve
wozniak
and
esther

share
his

his
vision
and
his
formidable

talents
they
are
people
of

its
turbulence
and
rewarded
with
wealth
and
influence
they
are
some
of
the
best
and
the
brightest
that
the
electronic
community
has
to
offer
but
can
they
do
it
in
the
real
world
or
are
they
only
dreaming
they
are
so
few
and
there
is
so
much
against
them
i
leave
kapor
and
his
networking
employees
struggling
cheerfully
with
the
promising
intricacies
of
their
newly
installed
macintosh
system
software
the
next
day
is
saturday
eff
is
closed
i
pay
a
few
visits
to
points
of
interest
downtown
one
of
them
is
the
birthplace
of
the

it
marked
by
a
bronze
plaque
in
a
plinth
of
speckled
granite
it
sits
in
the
plaza
of
the
john
kennedy
federal
building
the
very
place
where
kapor
was
once
fingerprinted
by
the

the

has

the

strikes
me
as

anomalous
do
they
already
have
their
own

then
the
suspicion
strikes
me
that
nynex

the

for

in

i
attended
the
cpsr
public

roundtable
in
washington

cpsr
computer
professionals
for
social
responsibility
was
a
sister
organization
of
eff
or
perhaps
its
aunt
being
older
and
perhaps
somewhat
wiser
in
the
ways
of
the
world
of
politics
computer
professionals
for
social
responsibility
began
in
in
palo
alto
as
an
informal
discussion
group
of
californian
computer
scientists
and
technicians
united
by
nothing
more
than
an
electronic
mailing
list
this
typical
received
the
dignity
of
its
own
acronym
in
and
was
formally
incorporated
in
cpsr
lobbied
government
and
public
alike
with
an
educational
outreach
effort
sternly
warning
against
any
foolish
and
unthinking
trust
in
complex
computer
systems
cpsr
insisted
that
mere
computers
should
never
be
considered
a
magic
panacea
for
humanity
social
ethical
or
political
problems
cpsr
members
were
especially
troubled
about
the
stability
safety
and
dependability
of
military
computer
systems
and
very
especially
troubled
by
those
systems
controlling
nuclear
arsenals
cpsr
was
for
its
persistent
and
attacks
on
the
scientific
credibility
of
the
strategic

initiative

in
cpsr
was
the

active
in

the

however
had
been

some
were

apparat
there
was
naturally
a
bit
of
on
both
sides
unfortunately
our
discussion
was
in
fact
all
the
discussions
at
the
cpsr
were
officially
the
idea
being
to
do
some
serious
networking
in
an
atmosphere
of
complete
frankness
rather
than
to
stage
a

circus
in
any
case
cpsr
roundtable
though
interesting
and
intensely
valuable
was
as
nothing

like

it

clear
to

that

his

barlow
scowling
in

wyoming
snowscape
with
long
black
coat
dark

a
macintosh
propped
on
a
fencepost
and
an
awesome
frontier
rifle
tucked
under

will
be
the
single
most
striking

image
of

he
is

along

of

what
on

do
they
expect
these

barlow
delivers
the
first
address
uncharacteristically
he
is
hoarse
the
sheer
volume
of
roadwork
has
worn
him
down
he
speaks
briefly
congenially
in
a
plea
for
conciliation
and
takes
his
leave
to
a
storm
of
applause
then
gail
thackeray
takes
the
stage
she
visibly
nervous
she
been
on

well
a
lot
lately
reading
those
barlow
posts
following
barlow
is
a
challenge
to
anyone
in
honor
of
the
famous
lyricist
for
the
grateful
dead
she
announces
reedily
she
is
going
to
read
a
poem
a
poem
she
has
composed
herself
it
an
awful
poem
doggerel
in
the
rollicking
meter
of
robert
the
cremation
of
sam
mcgee
but
it
is
in
fact
a
poem
it
the
ballad
of
the
electronic
frontier
a
poem
about
the
hacker
crackdown
and
the
sheer
unlikelihood
of
cfp
it
full
of
the
score
or
so
cops
in
the
audience
who
are
sitting
together
in

claque
are
absolutely
gail
poem
is
the
funniest
goddamn
thing
they
ever
heard
the

who

staring
with
their

hanging
loosely
never
in

of

had
they
figured
gail

was
capable
of
such
a
totally
move
you
can
see

punching

this

al
bayse
computer
technician
for

had
been
the
only
cop
at
the
cpsr
roundtable
dragged
there
with
his
arm
bent
by
dorothy
denning
he
was
guarded
and
tightlipped
at
cpsr
roundtable
a
lion
thrown
to
the
christians
at
cfp
backed
by
a
claque
of
cops
bayse
suddenly
waxes
eloquent
and
even
droll
describing
the
fbi
ncic
a
gigantic
digital
catalog
of
criminal
records
as
if
he
has
suddenly
become
some
weird
hybrid
of
george
orwell
and
george
gobel
tentatively
he
makes
an
arcane
joke
about
statistical
analysis
at
least
a
third
of
the
crowd
laughs
aloud
they
did
laugh
at
that
at
my
last
speech
bayse
observes
he
had
been
addressing
cops
straight
cops
not
computer
people
it
had
been
a
worthy
meeting
useful
one
supposes
but
nothing
like
this
there
has
never
been
anything
like
this
without
any
prodding
without
any
preparation
people
in
the
audience
simply
begin
to
ask
questions
longhairs
freaky
people
mathematicians
bayse
is
answering
politely
frankly
fully
like
a
man
walking
on

the
ballroom
atmosphere
crackles
with
surreality
a
female
lawyer
behind
me
breaks
into
a
sweat
and
a
hot
waft
of
surprisingly
potent
and
musky
perfume
flows
off
her
people
are
giddy
with
laughter
people
are
interested
fascinated
their

so
wide
and
dark
that
they
seem
eroticized

with

i
found

at
the

and
when
he
saw
my

he
turned
into
a
pillar
of
salt
she
chortles
phiber
discusses
his
case
at
much
length
with
his
arresting
officer
don
delaney
of

state
police
after
an
hour
chat
the
two
of
them
look
ready
to
begin
singing
auld
lang

phiber
finally
finds
the
courage
to
get
his
worst
complaint
off
his
chest
it
is
so
much
the
arrest
it
was
the
charge
pirating
service
off
numbers
i
a
programmer
phiber
insists
this
lame
charge
is
going
to
hurt
my
reputation
it
would
have
been
cool
to
be
busted
for
something
happening
like
section
computer
intrusion
maybe
some
kind
of
crime
that
scarcely
been
invented
yet
not
lousy
phone
fraud
phooey
delaney
seems
regretful
he
had
a
mountain
of
possible
criminal
charges
against
phiber
optik
the
kid
gon
na
plead
guilty
anyway
he
a
first
timer
they
always
plead
coulda
charged
the
kid
with
most
anything
and
gotten
the
same
result
in
the
end
delaney
seems
genuinely
sorry
not
to
have
gratified
phiber
in
this
harmless
fashion
too
late
now
phiber
pled
already
all
water
under
the
bridge
whaddya
gon
na
do
delaney
got
a
good
grasp
on
the
hacker
mentality
he
held
a
press
conference
after
he
busted
a
bunch
of
masters
of
deception
kids
some
journo
had
asked
him
would
you
describe
these
people
as
geniuses
delaney
deadpan
answer
perfect
no
i
would
describe
these
people
as
defendants
delaney
busts
a
kid
for
hacking
codes
with
repeated
random
dialling
tells
the
press
that
nynex
can
track
this
stuff
in
no
time
flat
nowadays
and
a
kid
has
to
be
stupid
to
do
something
so
easy
to
catch
dead
on
again
hackers
do
mind
being
thought
of
as
genghis
khan
by
the
straights
but
if
there
anything
that
really
gets
where
they
live
it
being
called
dumb
wo
be
as
much
fun
for
phiber
next
time
around
as
a
second
offender
he
gon
na
see
prison
hackers
break
the
law
they
not
geniuses
either
they
gon
na
be
defendants
and
yet
delaney
muses
over
a
drink
in
the
hotel
bar
he
has
found
it
impossible
to
treat
them
as
common
criminals
delaney
knows
criminals
these
kids
by
comparison
are
clueless
there
is
just
no
crook
vibe
off
of
them
they
do
smell
right
they
just
not
bad
delaney
has
seen
a
lot
of
action
he
did
vietnam
he
been
shot
at
he
has
shot
people
he
a

cop
from

he
has
the
appearance
of
a

who
has
not
only
seen
the
shit
hit
the
fan
but
has
seen
it
splattered
across
whole
city
blocks
and
left
to
ferment
for
years
this
guy
has
been
around
he
listens
to
steve
jackson
tell
his

the
dreamy
game
strategist
has
been
dealt
a
bad
hand
he
has
played
it
for
all
he
is
worth
under
his
nerdish
exterior
is
a

of
iron

of

say
steve

believes
in

rules
believes
in

play
he
will
never
compromise
his

never
give
up
steve
delaney
says
to
steve

they
had
some
balls
whoever
busted
you
you
all
right
jackson
stunned
falls
silent

actually
blushes
with

neidorf

he

were
just
a
curiosity
but
to
the

carries
his

nodding
and
saying
yes
yes
craig
you
too
can
forget
all
about

and
enter
the
glamorous
and
horribly
underpaid

of

put

you

indefinitely
you
can
not

with

later
you

the

changed
the
entire

drastically
john
quarterman
author
of

explains
the
internet
at
his
symposium
it
is
the
largest
news
network
in
the
world
it
is
growing
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
yet
you
can
not
measure
internet
because
you
can
not
stop
it
in
place
it
can
not
stop
because
there
is
no
one
anywhere
in
the
world
with
the
authority
to
stop
internet
it
changes
yes
it
grows
it
embeds
itself
across
the
postmodern
world
and
it
generates
community
wherever
it
touches
and
it
is
doing
this
all
by
itself

says
he
looks
like
an

dandy
he
does
rather
shaven
neck
the
sides
of
his
skull
cropped
close
unruly
tangle
of
black
hair
on
top
that
looks
pomaded
he
stays
up
till
four
and
misses
all
the
sessions
then
hangs
out
in
payphone
booths
with
his
acoustic
coupler
gutsily
cracking
systems
right
in
the
midst
of
the
heaviest
law
enforcement
dudes
in

or
at
least
pretending
to
unlike
frank
drake
drake
who
wrote
dorothy
denning
out
of
nowhere
and
asked
for
an
interview
for
his
cheapo
cyberpunk
fanzine
and
then
started
grilling
her
on
her
ethics
she
was
squirmin
too
drake
with
his
floppy
blond
mohawk
rotting
tennis
shoes
and
black
leather
jacket
lettered
illuminati
in
red
gives
off
an
unmistakeable
air
of
the
bohemian
literatus
drake
is
the
kind
of
guy
who
reads
british
industrial
design
magazines
and
appreciates
william
gibson
because
the
quality
of
the
prose
is
so
tasty
drake
could
never
touch
a

a

again
and
he
still
have
the

approaches
phiber
suddenly
the
two
of
them
are
about
the
same
height
and
denning
blue
eyes
flash
behind
the
round
of
her
glasses
why
did
you
say
i
was
she
asks
phiber
quaintly
it
a
perfect
description
but
phiber
is
nonplussed
well
i
uh
you
know
i
also
think
you
quaint
dorothy
i
say
novelist
to
the
rescue
the
journo
gift
of
gab
she
is
neat
and
dapper
and
yet
an
arcane
quality
to
her
something
like
a
pilgrim
maiden
behind
leaded
glass
if
she
were
six
inches
high
dorothy
denning
would
look
great
inside

weirdly
peter

you
could
pick

out
of

as
the
soulmate
of
dorothy
denning
wearing
tailored
slacks
a
spotless
fuzzy
varsity
sweater
and
a
neatly
knotted
academician
tie
this
fineboned
exquisitely
polite
utterly
civilized
and
hyperintelligent

seem
to
have
emerged
from
some
cleaner

finer

universe
where

in

why
does
this

hang
out
with

unsavory
characters

it
that
why
because

the

donn
parker
is
here
the
great
bald
eagle
of
computer
crime
with
his
bald
dome
great
height
and
enormous
hands
the
great
visionary
pioneer
of
the
field
plows
through
the
lesser
mortals
like
an
icebreaker
his
eyes
are
fixed
on
the
future
with
the
rigidity
of
a
bronze
statue
eventually
he
tells
his
audience
all
business
crime
will
be
computer
crime
because
businesses
will
do
everything
through
computers
computer
crime
as
a
category
will
vanish
in
the
meantime
passing
fads
will
flourish
and
fail
and
evaporate
parker
commanding
resonant
voice
is
sphinxlike
everything
is
viewed
from
some
eldritch
valley
of
deep
historical
abstraction
yes
they
come
and
they
gone
these
passing
flaps
in
the
world
of
digital
computation
the
emanation
scandal
kgb
and
and
cia
do
it
every
day
it
easy
but
nobody
else
ever
has
the
fraud
mostly
mythical
crimoids
he
calls
them
computer
viruses
are
the
current
crimoid
champ
a
lot
less
dangerous
than
most
people
let
on
but
the
novelty
is
fading
and
there
a
crimoid
vacuum
at
the
moment
the
press
is
visibly
hungering
for
something
more
outrageous
the
great
man
shares
with
us
a
few
speculations
on
the
coming
crimoids
desktop
forgery
wow
computers
stolen
just
for
the
sake
of
the
information
within
them
happened
in
britain
a
while
ago
could
be
the
coming
thing
phantom
nodes
in
the
internet
parker
handles
his
overhead
projector
sheets
with
an
ecclesiastical
air
he
wears
a
grey
suit
a
light
blue
shirt
and
a
very
quiet
tie
of
understated
maroon
and
blue
paisley
aphorisms
emerge
from
him
with
slow
leaden
emphasis
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
adequately
secure
computer
when
one
faces
a
sufficiently
powerful
adversary
deterrence
is
the
most
socially
useful
aspect
of
security
people
are
the
primary
weakness
in
all
information
systems
the
entire
baseline
of
computer
security
must
be
shifted
upward
do
ever
violate
your
security
by
publicly
describing
your
security
measures
people
in
the
audience
are
beginning
to
squirm
and
yet
there
is
something
about
the
elemental
purity
of
this
philosophy
that
compels
uneasy
respect
parker
sounds
like
the
only
sane
guy
left
in
the
lifeboat
sometimes
the
guy
who
can
prove
rigorously
from
deep
moral
principles
that
harvey
there
the
one
with
the
broken
leg
and
the
checkered
past
is
the
one
who
has
to
be
err
is
harvey
is
best
placed
to
make
the
necessary
sacrifice
for
the
security

indeed
the
very
survival

computer
security
parker
informs
us
mournfully
is
a
nasty
topic
and
we
wish
we
did
have
to
have
it
the
security
expert
armed
with
method
and
logic
must
think
imagine
everything
that
the
adversary
might
do
before
the
adversary
might
actually
do
it
it

as
if
the
criminal

an
extensive
subprogram

the
shining
cranium
of

perfectly
simulated
cfp
is
a
stellar
gathering
with
the
giddiness
of
a
wedding
it
is
a
happy
time
a
happy
ending
they
know
their
world
is
changing
forever
tonight
and
they
proud
to
have
been
there
to
see
it
happen
to
talk
to
think
to
help
and
yet
as
night
falls
a
certain
elegiac
quality
manifests
itself
as
the
crowd
gathers
beneath
the
chandeliers
with
their
wineglasses
and
dessert
plates
something
is
ending
here
gone
forever
and
it
takes
a
while
to
pinpoint
it
it
is
the
end
of
the
amateurs
