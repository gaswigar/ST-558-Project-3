and
the
online
distributed
proofreading
team
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
with
other
norwegian
folk
tales
retold
by
gudrun
illustrated
by
frederick
richardson
foreword
in
recent
years
there
has
been
a
wholesome
revival
of
the
ancient
art
of
the
most
thoughtful
progressive
educators
have
come
to
recognize
the
culture
value
of
folk
and
fairy
stories
fables
and
legends
not
only
as
means
of
fostering
and
directing
the
power
of
the
child
imagination
but
as
a
basis
for
literary
interpretation
and
appreciation
throughout
life
this
condition
has
given
rise
to
a
demand
for
the
best
material
in
each
of
these
several
lines
some
editors
have
gleaned
from
one
field
some
from
several
it
is
the
aim
of
this
little
book
to
bring
together
only
the
very
best
from
the
rich
stores
of
norwegian
all
these
stories
have
been
told
many
times
by
the
editor
to
varied
audiences
of
children
and
to
those
who
are
older
grown
each
has
proved
its
power
to
make
the
universal
appeal
in
preparing
the
stories
for
publication
the
aim
has
been
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
in
vocabulary
and
idiom
the
original
language
and
to
retain
the
conversational
style
of
the
teller
of
tales
in
order
that
the
sympathetic
young
reader
may
in
greater
or
less
degree
be
translated
into
the
atmosphere

once
on
a
time
there
was
a
poor
woodcutter
who
had
so
many
children
that
he
had
not
much
of
either
food
or
clothing
to
give
them
pretty
children
they
all
were
but
the
prettiest
was
the
youngest
daughter
who
was
so
lovely
there
was
no
end
to
her
loveliness
it
was
on
a
thursday
evening
late
in
the
fall
of
the
year
the
weather
was
wild
and
rough
outside
and
it
was
cruelly
dark
the
rain
fell
and
the
wind
blew
till
the
walls
of
the
cottage
shook
there
they
all
sat
round
the
fire
busy
with
this
thing
and
that
just
then
all
at
once
something
gave
three
taps
at
the
window
pane
then
the
father
went
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
when
he
got
out
of
doors
what
should
he
see
but
a
great
white
bear
good
evening
to
you
said
the
white
bear
the
same
to
you
said
the
man
will
you
give
me
your
youngest
daughter
if
you
will
i
make
you
as
rich
as
you
are
now
poor
said
the
bear
well
the
man
would
not
be
at
all
sorry
to
be
so
rich
but
give
him
his
prettiest
lassie
no
that
he
could
do
so
he
said
no
outright
and
closed
the
door
both
tight
and
well
but
the
bear
called
out
i
give
you
time
to
think
next
thursday
night
i
come
for
your
answer
now
the
lassie
had
heard
every
word
that
the
bear
had
said
and
before
the
next
thursday
evening
came
she
had
washed
and
mended
her
rags
made
herself
as
neat
as
she
could
and
was
ready
to
start
i
ca
say
her
packing
gave
her
much
trouble
next
thursday
evening
came
the
white
bear
to
fetch
her
and
she
got
upon
his
back
with
her
bundle
and
off
they
went
so
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
of
the
way
the
white
bear
said
are
you
afraid
no
not
at
all
said
the
lassie
well
mind
and
hold
tight
by
my
shaggy
coat
and
then
there
nothing
to
fear
added
the
bear
so
she
rode
a
long
long
way
till
they
came
to
a
great
steep
hill
there
on
the
face
of
it
the
white
bear
gave
a
knock
and
a
door
opened
and
they
came
into
a
castle
where
there
were
many
rooms
all
lit
up
gleaming
with
silver
and
gold
and
there
too
was
a
table
ready
laid
and
it
was
all
as
grand
as
grand
could
be
then
the
white
bear
gave
her
a
silver
bell
when
she
wanted
anything
she
had
only
to
ring
it
and
she
would
get
what
she
wanted
at
once
well
when
she
had
had
supper
and
evening
wore
on
she
became
sleepy
because
of
her
journey
she
thought
she
would
like
to
go
to
bed
so
she
rang
the
bell
she
had
scarce
taken
hold
of
it
before
she
came
into
a
chamber
where
there
were
two
beds
as
fair
and
white
as
any
one
would
wish
to
sleep
in
but
when
she
had
put
out
the
light
and
gone
to
bed
some
one
came
into
the
room
and
lay
down
in
the
other
bed
now
this
happened
every
night
but
she
never
saw
who
it
was
for
he
always
came
after
she
had
put
out
the
light
and
before
the
day
dawned
he
was
up
and
off
again
so
things
went
on
for
a
while
the
lassie
having
everything
she
wanted
but
you
must
know
that
no
human
being
did
she
see
from
morning
till
night
only
the
white
bear
could
she
talk
to
and
she
did
not
know
what
man
or
monster
it
might
be
who
came
to
sleep
in
her
room
by
night
at
last
she
began
to
be
silent
and
sorrowful
and
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
one
day
the
white
bear
came
to
her
and
said
lassie
why
are
you
so
sorrowful
this
castle
and
all
that
is
in
it
are
yours
the
silver
bell
will
give
you
anything
that
you
wish
i
only
beg
one
thing
of
you
ask
no
questions
trust
me
and
nothing
shall
harm
you
so
now
be
happy
again
but
still
the
lassie
had
no
peace
of
mind
for
one
thing
she
wished
to
know
who
it
was
who
came
in
the
night
and
slept
in
her
room
all
day
long
and
all
night
long
she
wondered
and
longed
to
know
and
she
fretted
and
pined
away
so
one
night
when
she
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
and
she
heard
that
he
slept
she
got
up
lit
a
bit
of
a
candle
and
let
the
light
shine
on
him
then
she
saw
that
he
was
the
loveliest
prince
one
ever
set
eyes
on
and
she
bent
over
and
kissed
him
but
as
she
kissed
him
she
dropped
three
drops
of
hot
tallow
on
his
shirt
and
he
woke
up
what
have
you
done
he
cried
now
you
have
made
us
both
unlucky
for
had
you
held
out
only
this
one
year
i
had
been
freed
for
i
am
the
white
bear
by
day
and
a
man
by
night
it
is
a
wicked
witch
who
has
bewitched
me
and
now
i
must
set
off
from
you
to
her
she
lives
in
a
castle
which
stands
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
and
there
are
many
trolls
and
witches
there
and
one
of
those
is
the
wife
i
must
now
have
she
wept
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
go
he
must
then
she
asked
if
she
might
go
with
him
no
she
might
tell
me
the
way
then
she
said
and
i
search
you
out
that
surely
i
may
get
leave
to
do
yes
you
may
do
that
he
said
but
there
is
no
way
to
that
place
it
lies
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
and
thither
you
can
never
find
your
way
and
at
that
very
moment
both
prince
and
castle
were
gone
and
she
lay
on
a
little
green
patch
in
the
midst
of
the
gloomy
thick
wood
and
by
her
side
lay
the
same
bundle
of
rags
she
had
brought
with
her
from
home
then
she
wept
and
wept
till
she
was
tired
and
all
the
while
she
thought
of
the
lovely
prince
and
how
she
should
find
him
so
at
last
she
set
out
on
her
way
and
walked
many
many
days
and
whomever
she
met
she
asked
can
you
tell
me
the
way
to
the
castle
that
lies
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
but
no
one
could
tell
her
and
on
she
went
a
weary
time
both
hungry
and
tired
was
she
when
she
got
to
the
east
wind
house
one
morning
there
she
asked
the
east
wind
if
he
could
tell
her
the
way
to
the
prince
who
dwelt
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
yes
the
east
wind
had
often
heard
tell
of
it
the
prince
and
the
castle
but
he
could
tell
the
way
for
he
had
never
blown
so
far
but
if
you
will
i
go
with
you
to
my
brother
the
west
wind
maybe
he
knows
for
he
much
stronger
so
if
you
will
just
get
on
my
back
i
carry
you
thither
yes
she
got
on
his
back
and
i
can
tell
you
they
went
briskly
along
so
when
they
got
there
they
went
into
the
west
wind
house
and
the
east
wind
said
that
the
lassie
he
had
brought
was
the
one
who
ought
to
marry
the
prince
who
lived
in
the
castle
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
and
that
she
had
set
out
to
seek
him
and
would
be
glad
to
know
if
the
west
wind
knew
how
to
get
to
the
castle
nay
said
the
west
wind
so
far
i
never
blown
but
if
you
will
i
go
with
you
to
our
brother
the
south
wind
for
he
is
much
stronger
than
either
of
us
and
he
has
flapped
his
wings
far
and
wide
maybe
he
tell
you
you
can
get
on
my
back
and
i
carry
you
to
him
yes
she
got
on
his
back
and
so
they
travelled
to
the
south
wind
and
were
not
long
on
the
way
either
when
they
got
there
the
west
wind
asked
him
if
he
could
tell
her
the
way
to
the
castle
that
lay
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
for
it
was
she
who
ought
to
marry
the
prince
who
lived
there
you
do
say
so
that
she
is
it
said
the
south
wind
well
i
have
blustered
about
in
most
places
in
my
time
but
that
far
i
have
never
blown
however
if
you
will
i
take
you
to
my
brother
the
north
wind
he
is
the
oldest
and
strongest
of
all
of
us
and
if
he
does
know
where
it
is
you
never
find
anyone
in
the
world
to
tell
you
you
can
get
on
my
back
and
i
carry
you
thither
yes
she
got
on
his
back
and
away
he
went
from
his
house
at
a
fine
rate
and
this
time
too
she
was
not
long
on
the
way
when
they
got
near
the
north
wind
house
he
was
so
wild
and
cross
that
cold
puffs
came
from
him
heigh
there
what
do
you
want
he
bawled
out
to
them
ever
so
far
off
so
that
it
struck
them
with
an
icy
shiver
well
said
the
south
wind
you
need
be
so
put
out
for
here
i
am
your
brother
the
south
wind
and
here
is
the
lassie
who
ought
to
marry
the
prince
who
dwells
in
the
castle
that
lies
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
she
wants
to
ask
you
if
you
ever
were
there
and
can
tell
her
the
way
for
she
would
be
so
glad
to
find
him
again
yes
i
know
well
enough
where
it
is
said
the
north
wind
once
in
my
life
i
blew
an
aspen
leaf
thither
but
i
was
so
tired
i
could
blow
a
puff
for
ever
so
many
days
after
it
but
if
you
really
wish
to
go
thither
and
are
afraid
to
come
along
with
me
i
take
you
on
my
back
and
see
if
i
can
blow
you
there
yes
and
thank
you
she
said
for
she
must
and
would
get
thither
if
it
were
possible
in
any
way
and
as
for
fear
however
madly
he
went
she
would
be
at
all
afraid
very
well
then
said
the
north
wind
but
you
must
sleep
here
for
we
must
have
the
whole
day
before
us
if
we
to
get
thither
at
all
early
next
morning
the
north
wind
woke
her
and
puffed
himself
up
and
blew
himself
out
and
made
himself
so
stout
and
big
it
was
gruesome
to
look
at
him
and
so
off
she
went
high
on
the
back
of
the
north
wind
up
through
the
air
as
if
they
would
never
stop
till
they
got
to
the
world
end
down
here
below
there
was
a
terrible
storm
it
threw
down
long
tracts
of
woodland
and
many
houses
and
when
it
swept
over
the
great
sea
ships
foundered
by
hundreds
so
they
tore
on
and
on
no
one
can
believe
how
far
they
went
and
all
the
while
they
still
went
over
the
sea
and
the
north
wind
got
more
and
more
weary
and
so
out
of
breath
he
could
scarce
bring
out
a
puff
and
his
wings
drooped
and
drooped
till
at
last
he
sunk
so
low
that
the
crests
of
the
waves
lashed
over
her
heels
are
you
afraid
said
the
north
wind
she
was
but
they
were
not
very
far
from
land
and
the
north
wind
had
still
so
much
strength
left
in
him
that
he
managed
to
throw
her
up
on
shore
close
by
the
castle
which
lay
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
but
then
he
was
so
weak
and
worn
out
that
he
had
to
stay
there
and
rest
many
days
before
he
could
get
home
again
and
now
the
lassie
began
to
look
about
her
and
to
think
of
how
she
might
free
the
prince
but
nowhere
did
she
see
a
sign
of
life
then
she
sat
herself
down
right
under
the
castle
windows
and
as
soon
as
the
sun
went
down
out
they
came
trolls
and
witches
hags
tumbling
over
each
other
scolding
hurrying
and
scurrying
hither
and
thither
at
first
they
almost
frightened
the
life
out
of
her
but
when
she
had
watched
them
awhile
and
they
had
not
noticed
her
she
took
courage
and
walked
up
to
one
of
them
and
said
pray
tell
me
what
goes
on
here
that
you
are
all
so
busy
and
could
i
perhaps
get
something
to
do
for
a
night
lodging
and
a
bit
of
food
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
horrid
witch
and
where
do
you
come
from
that
you
do
not
know
that
it
is
that
the
prince
chooses
his
bride
when
the
moon
stands
high
over
the
tree
tops
yonder
we
meet
in
the
clearing
by
the
old
oak
there
the
caldrons
are
ready
with
boiling
lye
for
do
you
know
he
going
to
choose
for
his
bride
the
one
who
can
wash
three
spots
of
tallow
from
his
shirt
ha
ha
ha
and
the
wicked
witch
hurried
off
again
laughing
such
a
horrible
laugh
that
it
made
the
lassie
blood
run
cold
but
now
the
trolls
and
witches
came
trooping
out
of
the
very
earth
it
seemed
and
all
turned
their
steps
toward
the
clearing
in
the
woods
so
the
lassie
went
too
and
found
a
place
among
the
rest
now
the
moon
stood
high
above
the
tree
tops
and
there
was
the
caldron
in
the
middle
and
round
about
sat
the
trolls
and
witches
such
gruesome
company
sure
you
were
never
in
then
came
the
prince
he
looked
about
from
one
to
the
other
and
he
saw
the
lassie
and
his
face
grew
white
but
he
said
nothing
now
let
begin
said
a
witch
with
a
nose
three
ells
long
she
was
sure
she
was
going
to
have
the
prince
and
she
began
to
wash
away
as
hard
as
she
could
but
the
more
she
rubbed
and
scrubbed
the
bigger
the
spots
grew
ah
said
an
old
hag
you
ca
wash
let
me
try
but
she
had
long
taken
the
shirt
in
hand
before
it
was
far
worse
than
ever
and
with
all
her
rubbing
and
scrubbing
and
wringing
the
spots
grew
bigger
and
blacker
and
the
darker
and
uglier
was
the
shirt
then
all
the
other
trolls
began
to
wash
but
the
longer
it
lasted
the
blacker
and
uglier
the
shirt
grew
till
at
last
it
was
as
black
all
over
as
if
it
had
been
up
the
chimney
ah
said
the
prince

of
you
worth
a
straw
you
why
there
sits
a
beggar

bound

he
i

said
but
i

and
almost
before
she
had
taken
it
and
dipped
it
in
the
water
it
was
as
white
as
snow
and
whiter
still
yes
you
are
the
lassie
for
me
said
the
prince
at
that
moment
the
sun
rose
and
the
whole
pack
of
trolls
turned
to
stone
there
you
may
see
them
to
this
very
day
sitting
around
in
a
circle
big
ones
and
little
ones
all
hard
cold
stone
but
the
prince
took
the
lassie
by
the
hand
and
they
flitted
away
as
far
as
they
could
from
the
castle
that
lay
east
o
the
sun
and
west
o
the
moon
the
three
billy
goats
gruff
once
on
a
time
there
were
three
billy
goats
who
were
to
go
up
to
the
hillside
to
make
themselves
fat
and
the
family
name
of
the
goats
was
gruff
on
the
way
up
was
a
bridge
over
a
river
which
they
had
to
cross
and
under
the
bridge
lived
a
great
ugly
troll
with
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
and
a
nose
as
long
as
a
poker
first
of
all
came
the
youngest
billy
goat
gruff
to
cross
the
bridge
trip
trap
trip

went
the
bridge
that
tripping
over
my
bridge
roared
the
troll
oh

is
only
i
the
tiniest
billy
goat
gruff
and
i
going
up
to
the
hillside
to
make
myself
fat
said
the
billy
goat
with
such
a
small
voice
now
i
coming
to
gobble
you
up
said
the
troll

said
the
troll
a
little
while
after
came

across
the
bridge

and
i
going
up
to
the
hillside
to

said
the
billy
goat
nor
had
he
such
a
small
voice
either
now
i
coming
to
gobble
you
up
said
the
troll
oh

a
little
till
the
big
billy
goat
comes
he
much

very
well

said
the
troll
but
just
then
up
came
the
big
billy
goat
gruff
trip
trap
trip
trap
trip
trap
went
the
bridge
for
the
billy
goat
was
so
heavy
that
the
bridge
creaked
and
groaned
under
him
that
tramping
on
my
bridge
roared
the
troll
it
i
the
big
billy
goat
gruff
said
the
billy
goat
and
he
had
a
big
hoarse
voice
now
i
coming
to
gobble
you
up
roared
the
troll
come
i
have
two
spears
so
stout
with
them
i
thrust

eyeballs

two
great
big
stones
with
them
i
crush
you
body
and
bones
that
was
what
the
big
billy
goat
said
so
he
flew
at
the
troll
and
thrust
him
with
his
horns
and
crushed
him
to
bits
body
and
bones
and
tossed
him
out
into
the
river
and
after
that
he
went
up
to
the
hillside
there
the
billy
goats
got
so
fat
that
they
were
scarcely
able
to
walk
home
again
and
if
they
have
grown
thinner
why
they
still
fat
and
so
snip
snap
stout
this
tale
told
out
taper
tom
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
king
who
had
a
daughter
and
she
was
so
lovely
that
her
good
looks
were
well
known
far
and
near
but
she
was
so
sad
and
serious
she
could
never
be
got
to
laugh
and
besides
she
was
so
high
and
mighty
that
she
said
no
to
all
who
came
to
woo
her
she
would
have
none
of
them
were
they
ever
so
grand
lords
or
princes
it
was
all
the
same
the
king
had
long
ago
become
tired
of
this
for
he
thought
she
might
just
as
well
marry
she
too
like
all
other
people
there
was
no
use
in
waiting
she
was
quite
old
enough
nor
would
she
be
any
richer
for
she
was
to
have
half
the
kingdom
that
came
to
her
as
her
mother
heir
so
he
had
word
sent
throughout
the
kingdom
that
anyone
who
could
get
his
daughter
to
laugh
should
have
her
for
his
wife
and
half
the
kingdom
besides
but
if
there
was
anyone
who
tried
and
could
not
he
was
to
have
a
sound
thrashing
and
sure
it
was
that
there
were
many
sore
backs
in
that
kingdom
for
lovers
and
wooers
came
from
north
and
south
and
east
and
west
thinking
it
nothing
at
all
to
make
a
king
daughter
laugh
and
gay
fellows
they
were
some
of
them
too
but
for
all
their
tricks
and
capers
there
sat
the
princess
just
as
sad
and
serious
as
she
had
been
before
now
not
far
from
the
palace
lived
a
man
who
had
three
sons
and
they
too
had
heard
how
the
king
had
given
it
out
that
the
man
who
could
make
the
princess
laugh
was
to
have
her
to
wife
and
half
the
kingdom
the
eldest
was
for
setting
off
first
so
he
strode
off
and
when
he
came
to
the
king
grange
he
told
the
king
he
would
be
glad
to
try
to
make
the
princess
laugh
all
very
well
my
man
said
the
king
but
it
sure
to
be
of
no
use
for
so
many
have
been
here
and
tried
my
daughter
is
so
sorrowful
no
use
trying
and
it
not
my
wish
that
anyone
should
come
to
grief
but
the
lad
thought
he
would
like
to
try
it
could
be
such
a
very
hard
thing
for
him
to
get
the
princess
to
laugh
for
so
many
had
laughed
at
him
both
gentle
and
simple
when
he
enlisted
for
a
soldier
and
was
drilled
by
corporal
jack
so
he
went
off
to
the
courtyard
under
the
princess
window
and
began
to
go
through
his
drill
as
corporal
jack
had
taught
him
but
it
was
no
good
the
princess
was
just
as
sad
and
serious
and
did
not
so
much
as
smile
at
him
once
so
they
took
him
and
thrashed
him
well
and
sent
him
home
again
well
he
had
hardly
got
home
before
his
second
brother
wanted
to
set
off
he
was
a
schoolmaster
and
the
funniest
figure
one
ever
laid
eyes
upon
he
was
lopsided
for
he
had
one
leg
shorter
than
the
other
and
one
moment
he
was
as
little
as
a
boy
and
in
another
when
he
stood
on
his
long
leg
he
was
as
tall
and
long
as
a
troll
besides
this
he
was
a
powerful
preacher
so
when
he
came
to
the
king
palace
and
said
he
wished
to
make
the
princess
laugh
the
king
thought
it
might
not
be
so
unlikely
after
all
but
mercy
on
you
he
said
if
you
do
make
her
laugh
we
are
for
laying
it
on
harder
and
harder
for
every
one
that
fails
then
the
schoolmaster
strode
off
to
the
courtyard
and
put
himself
before
the
princess
window
and
read
and
preached
like
seven
parsons
and
sang
and
chanted
like
seven
clerks
as
loud
as
all
the
parsons
and
clerks
in
the
country
round
the
king
laughed
loud
at
him
and
the
princess
almost
smiled
a
little
but
then
became
as
sad
and
serious
as
ever
and
so
it
fared
no
better
with
paul
the
schoolmaster
than
with
peter
the
soldier
for
you
must
know
one
was
called
peter
and
the
other
paul
so
they
took
him
and
flogged
him
well
and
then
they
sent
him
home
again
then
the
youngest
whose
name
was
taper
tom
was
all
for
setting
out
but
his
brothers
laughed
and
jeered
at
him
and
showed
him
their
sore
backs
and
his
father
said
it
was
no
use
for
him
to
go
for
he
had
no
sense
was
it
not
true
that
he
neither
knew
anything
nor
could
do
anything
there
he
sat
in
the
hearth
like
a
cat
and
grubbed
in
the
ashes
and
split
tapers
that
was
why
they
called
him
taper
tom
but
taper
tom
would
not
give
in
and
so
they
got
tired
of
his
growling
and
at
last
he
too
got
leave
to
go
to
the
king
palace
to
try
his
luck
when
he
got
there
he
did
not
say
that
he
wished
to
try
to
make
the
princess
laugh
but
asked
if
he
could
get
work
there
no
they
had
no
place
for
him
but
for
all
that
taper
tom
would
not
give
up
in
such
a
big
palace
they
must
want
someone
to
carry
wood
and
water
for
the
kitchen
maid
that
was
what
he
said
and
the
king
thought
it
might
very
well
be
for
he
too
got
tired
of
his
teasing
in
the
end
taper
tom
stayed
there
to
carry
wood
and
water
for
the
kitchen
maid
so
one
day
when
he
was
going
to
fetch
water
from
the
brook
he
set
eyes
upon
a
big
fish
which
lay
under
an
old
fir
stump
where
the
water
had
eaten
into
the
bank
and
he
put
his
bucket
softly
under
the
fish
and
caught
it
but
as
he
was
gong
home
to
the
grange
he
met
an
old
woman
who
led
a
golden
goose
by
a
string
godmother
said
taper
tom
that
a
pretty
bird
you
have
and
what
fine
feathers
if
one
only
had
such
feathers
one
might
leave
off
splitting
fir
tapers
the
goody
was
just
as
pleased
with
the
fish
tom
had
in
his
bucket
and
said
if
he
would
give
her
the
fish
he
might
have
the
golden
goose
and
it
was
such
a
curious
goose
when
any
one
touched
it
he
stuck
fast
to
it
if
tom
only
said
if
you
want
to
come
along
hang
on
of
course
taper
tom
was
willing
enough
to
make
the
exchange
a
bird
is
as
good
as
a
fish
any
day
he
said
to
himself
and
if
it
such
a
bird
as
you
say
i
can
use
it
as
a
fish
hook
that
was
what
he
said
to
the
goody
and
he
was
much
pleased
with
the
goose
now
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
met
another
old
woman
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
lovely
golden
goose
she
spoke
prettily
and
coaxed
and
begged
tom
to
give
her
leave
to
stroke
his
lovely
golden
goose
with
all
my
heart
said
taper
tom
and
just
as
she
stroked
the
goose
he
said
if
you
want
to
come
along
hang
on
the
goody
pulled
and
tore
but
she
was
forced
to
hang
on
whether
she
would
or
not
and
taper
tom
went
on
as
though
he
alone
were
with
the
golden
goose
when
he
had
gone
a
bit
farther
he
met
a
man
who
had
had
a
quarrel
with
the
old
woman
for
a
trick
she
had
played
him
so
when
he
saw
how
hard
she
struggled
and
strove
to
get
free
and
how
fast
she
stuck
he
thought
he
would
just
pay
her
off
the
old
grudge
and
so
he
gave
her
a
kick
with
his
foot
if
you
want
to
come
along
hang
on
called
out
tom
and
then
the
old
man
had
to
hop
along
on
one
leg
whether
he
would
or
not
when
he
tore
and
tugged
and
tried
to
get
loose
it
was
still
worse
for
him
for
he
all
but
fell
flat
on
his
back
every
step
he
took
in
this
way
they
went
on
a
good
bit
till
they
had
nearly
reached
the
king
palace
there
they
met
the
king
smith
who
was
going
to
the
smithy
and
had
a
great
pair
of
tongs
in
his
hand
now
you
must
know
this
smith
was
a
merry
fellow
full
of
both
tricks
and
pranks
and
when
he
saw
this
string
come
hobbling
and
limping
along
he
laughed
so
that
he
was
almost
bent
double
then
he
bawled
out
surely
this
is
a
new
flock
of
geese
the
princess
is
going
to
have
ah
here
is
the
gander
that
toddles
in
front
goosey
goosey
goosey
he
called
and
with
that
he
threw
his
hands
about
as
though
he
were
scattering
corn
for
the
geese
but
the
flock
never
stopped
on
it
went
and
all
that
the
goody
and
the
man
did
was
to
look
daggers
at
the
smith
for
making
fun
of
them
then
the
smith
went
on
it
would
be
fine
fun
to
see
if
i
could
hold
the
whole
flock
so
many
as
they
are
for
he
was
a
stout
strong
fellow
so
he
took
hold
with
his
big
tongs
by
the
old
man
coat
tail
and
the
man
all
the
while
screeched
and
wriggled
but
taper
tom
only
said
if
you
want
to
come
along
hang
on
so
the
smith
had
to
go
along
too
he
bent
his
back
and
stuck
his
heels
into
the
ground
and
tried
to
get
loose
but
it
was
all
no
good
he
stuck
fast
as
though
he
had
been
screwed
tight
with
his
own
vise
and
whether
he
would
or
not
he
had
to
dance
along
with
the
rest
so
when
they
came
near
to
the
king
palace
the
dog
ran
out
and
began
to
bark
as
though
they
were
wolves
and
beggars
and
when
the
princess
looking
out
of
the
window
to
see
what
was
the
matter
set
eyes
on
this
strange
pack
she
laughed
softly
to
herself
but
taper
tom
was
not
content
with
that
bide
a
bit
he
said
she
will
soon
have
to
make
a
noise
and
as
he
said
that
he
turned
off
with
his
band
to
the
back
of
the
palace
when
they
passed
by
the
kitchen
the
door
stood
open
and
the
cook
was
just
stirring
the
porridge
but
when
she
saw
taper
tom
and
his
pack
she
came
running
out
at
the
door
with
her
broom
in
one
hand
and
a
ladle
full
of
smoking
porridge
in
the
other
and
she
laughed
as
though
her
sides
would
split
and
when
she
saw
the
smith
there
too
she
bent
double
and
went
off
again
in
a
loud
peal
of
laughter
but
when
she
had
had
her
laugh
out
she
too
thought
the
golden
goose
so
lovely
she
must
just
stroke
it
taper
tom
taper
tom
she
called
out
and
came
running
out
with
the
ladle
of
porridge
in
her
fist
give
me
leave
to
pet
that
pretty
bird
of
yours
better
come
and
pet
me
said
the
smith
but
when
the
cook
heard
that
she
got
angry
what
is
that
you
say
she
cried
and
gave
the
smith
a
box
on
his
ears
with
the
ladle
if
you
want
to
come
along
hang
on
said
taper
tom
so
she
stuck
fast
too
and
for
all
her
kicks
and
plunges
and
all
her
scolding
and
screaming
and
all
her
riving
and
striving
she
too
had
to
limp
along
with
them
illustration
she
opened
her
mouth
wide
and
laughed
soon
the
whole
company
came
under
the
princess
window
there
she
stood
waiting
for
them
and
when
she
saw
they
had
taken
the
cook
too
with
her
ladle
and
broom
she
opened
her
mouth
wide
and
laughed
so
loud
that
the
king
had
to
hold
her
upright
so
taper
tom
got
the
princess
and
half
the
kingdom
and
they
say
he
kept
her
in
high
spirits
with
his
tricks
and
pranks
till
the
end
of
her
days
why
the
bear
is
one
day
the
bear
met
the
fox
who
came
slinking
along
with
a
string
of
fish
he
had
stolen
where
did
you
get
those
asked
the
bear
oh
my
lord
bruin
i
been
out
fishing
and
caught
them
said
the
fox
so
the
bear
had
a
mind
to
learn
to
fish
too
and
bade
the
fox
tell
him
how
he
was
to
set
about
it
oh
it
is
an
easy
craft
for
you
answered
the
fox
and
soon
learned
you
only
to
go
upon
the
ice
cut
a
hole
stick
your
tail
down
into
it
and
hold
it
there
as
long
as
you
can
you
not
to
mind
if
your
tail
smarts
a
little
that
when
the
fish
bite
the
longer
you
hold
it
there
the
more
fish
you
get
and
then
all
at
once
out
with
it
with
a
cross
pull
sideways
and
with
a
strong
pull
too
yes
the
bear
did
as
the
fox
had
said
and
held
his
tail
a
long
long
time
down
in
the
hole
till
it
was
frozen
in
fast
then
he
pulled
it
out
with
a
cross
pull
and
it
snapped
short
off
that
why
bruin
goes
about
with
a
stumpy
tail
to
this
very
day
reynard
and
the
cock
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
cock
who
stood
on
the
barnyard
fence
and
crowed
and
flapped
his
wings
then
the
fox
came
by
said
reynard
i
have
heard
you
crowing
so
nicely
but
can
you
stand
on
one
leg
and
crow
and
wink
your
eyes
oh
yes
said
the
cock
i
can
do
that
very
well
so
he
stood
on
one
leg
and
crowed
but
he
winked
only
with
one
eye
and
when
he
had
done
that
he
made
himself
big
and
flapped
his
wings
as
though
he
had
done
a
great
thing
very
pretty
to
be
sure
said
reynard
almost
as
pretty
as
when
the
parson
preaches
in
church
but
can
you
stand
on
one
leg
and
wink
both
your
eyes
at
once
i
hardly
think
you
can
ca
i
though
said
the
cock
and
stood
on
one
leg
and
winked
both
his
eyes
and
crowed
but
reynard
caught
hold
of
him
took
him
by
the
throat
and
threw
him
on
his
back
so
that
he
was
off
to
the
wood
before
he
had
crowed
his
crow
out
as
fast
as
reynard
could
lay
legs
to
the
ground
when
they
had
come
under
an
old
spruce
fir
reynard
threw
the
cock
on
the
ground
and
set
his
paw
on
his
breast
and
was
going
to
take
a
bite
you
are
a
heathen
reynard
said
the
cock
good
christians
say
grace
before
they
eat
but
reynard
would
be
no
heathen
no
indeed
so
he
let
go
his
hold
and
was
about
to
fold
his
paws
over
his
breast
and
say
grace
but
pop
up
flew
the
cock
into
a
tree
you
sha
get
off
for
all
that
said
reynard
to
himself
so
he
went
away
and
came
again
with
a
few
chips
which
the
woodcutters
had
left
the
cock
peeped
and
peered
to
see
what
they
could
be
what
is
that
you
have
there
he
asked
these
are
letters
i
have
just
got
said
reynard
wo
you
help
me
to
read
them
for
i
do
know
how
to
read
writing
i
be
so
happy
but
i
dare
not
read
them
now
said
the
cock
for
here
comes
a
hunter
i
see
him
i
see
him
with
his
pouch
and
gun
when
reynard
heard
the
cock
chattering
about
a
hunter
he
took
to
his
heels
as
fast
as
he
could
bruin
and
reynard
partners
once
on
a
time
bruin
and
reynard
owned
a
field
in
common
they
had
a
little
clearing
up
in
the
wood
and
the
first
year
they
sowed
rye
now
we
must
share
the
crop
as
is
fair
and
right
said
reynard
if
you
like
to
have
the
root
i
take
the
top
yes
bruin
was
ready
to
do
that
but
when
they
had
threshed
out
the
crop
reynard
got
all
the
corn
but
bruin
got
nothing
but
roots
and
rubbish
he
did
not
like
that
at
all
but
reynard
said
that
was
how
they
had
agreed
to
share
it
this
year
i
have
the
gain
said
reynard
next
year
it
will
be
your
turn
then
you
shall
have
the
top
and
i
shall
have
to
put
up
with
the
root
but
when
spring
came
and
it
was
time
to
sow
reynard
asked
bruin
what
he
thought
of
turnips
aye
aye
said
bruin
that
better
food
than
rye
and
so
reynard
thought
also
but
when
harvest
time
came
reynard
got
the
roots
while
bruin
got
the
and
then
bruin
was
so
angry
with
reynard
that
he
put
an
end
at
once
to
his
partnership
with
him
boots
and
his
brothers
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
who
had
three
sons
peter
paul
and
espen
espen
was
boots
of
course
because
he
was
the
youngest
i
say
the
man
had
anything
except
these
three
sons
for
he
did
not
possess
one
penny
to
rub
against
another
and
so
he
told
his
sons
over
and
over
again
they
must
go
out
into
the
world
to
seek
their
fortune
for
at
home
there
was
nothing
to
be
expected
but
to
starve
to
death
now
a
short
way
from
the
man
cottage
was
the
king
palace
and
you
must
know
just
against
the
king
windows
a
great
oak
had
sprung
up
which
was
so
stout
and
big
that
it
took
away
all
the
light
from
the
king
palace
the
king
had
said
he
would
give
much
gold
to
any
man
who
could
fell
the
oak
but
no
one
was
man
enough
to
do
it
for
as
soon
as
one
chip
of
the
oak
trunk
flew
off
two
grew
in
its
stead
the
king
wished
also
to
have
a
well
dug
which
was
to
hold
water
for
the
whole
year
all
his
neighbors
had
wells
but
he
had
none
and
he
thought
that
a
shame
so
the
king
said
he
would
give
to
any
one
who
could
dig
him
such
a
well
as
would
hold
water
for
the
whole
year
round
both
money
and
goods
but
no
one
could
do
it
for
the
king
palace
lay
high
high
up
on
a
hill
and
they
could
dig
but
a
few
inches
before
they
would
come
upon
rock
but
as
the
king
had
set
his
heart
on
having
these
two
things
done
he
had
it
given
out
in
all
the
churches
of
his
kingdom
far
and
wide
that
he
who
could
fell
the
big
oak
in
the
king
courtyard
and
dig
him
a
well
that
would
hold
water
the
whole
year
round
should
have
the
princess
and
half
the
kingdom
well
you
may
easily
know
there
was
many
a
man
who
came
to
try
his
luck
but
all
their
hacking
and
hewing
and
all
their
digging
and
delving
were
useless
the
oak
got
bigger
and
stouter
at
every
stroke
and
the
rock
grew
no
softer
either
one
day
the
three
brothers
thought
they
too
would
set
off
and
try
it
their
father
had
not
a
word
to
say
against
it
for
even
if
they
did
not
get
the
princess
and
half
the
kingdom
it
might
happen
they
would
get
a
place
somewhere
with
a
good
master
and
that
was
all
he
wanted
so
when
the
brothers
asked
his
permission
he
consented
at
once
and
peter
paul
and
espen
set
forth
well
they
had
not
gone
far
before
they
came
to
a
fir
wood
where
at
one
side
there
rose
a
steep
hill
and
as
they
went
along
they
heard
something
hewing
and
hacking
away
up
on
the
hill
among
the
trees
i
wonder
now
what
it
is
that
is
hewing
away
up
yonder
said
boots
you
always
so
clever
with
your
wondering
laughed
peter
and
paul
both
at
once
what
wonder
is
it
pray
that
a
wood
cutter
should
stand
and
hack
up
on
a
hillside
still
i
like
to
see
what
it
is
after
all
said
boots
and
up
he
went
oh
if
you
such
a
child
do
you
good
to
go
and
take
a
lesson
called
out
his
brothers
after
him
but
boots
did
care
for
what
they
said
he
climbed
the
steep
hillside
towards
the
spot
whence
the
noise
came
and
when
he
reached
the
place
what
do
you
think
he
saw
why
an
axe
that
stood
there
hacking
and
hewing
all
of
itself
at
the
trunk
of
a
fir
tree
said
boots
so
you
stand
here
all
alone
and
hew
do
you
yes
here
i
stood
and
hewed
and
hacked
for
hundreds
of
years
waiting
for
you
said
the
axe
well
here
i
am
at
last
said
boots
as
he
took
the
axe
pulled
it
off
its
haft
and
stuffed
both
head
and
haft
into
his
wallet
when
he
got
down
again
to
his
brothers
they
began
to
jeer
and
laugh
at
him
and
now
what
strange
thing
was
it
you
saw
up
yonder
on
the
hillside
they
asked
oh
it
was
only
an
axe
we
heard
said
boots
when
they
had
gone
on
a
bit
farther
their
road
passed
under
a
steep
spur
of
rock
where
they
heard
something
digging
and
shovelling
illustration
a
spade
that
stood
digging
and
delving
i
wonder
now
said
boots
what
is
digging
and
shovelling
up
yonder
at
the
top
of
the
rock
ah
you
always
so
clever
with
your
wondering
laughed
peter
and
paul
again
as
if
you
never
heard
a
woodpecker
hacking
and
pecking
at
a
hollow
tree
well
well
said
boots
i
just
think
it
would
be
fun
to
see
what
it
really
is
and
so
off
he
set
to
climb
the
rock
while
the
others
laughed
and
made
fun
of
him
but
he
did
not
care
a
bit
for
that
up
he
climbed
and
when
he
got
near
the
top
what
do
you
think
he
saw
why
a
spade
that
stood
there
digging
and
delving
said
boots
so
you
stand
here
all
alone
and
dig
and
delve
do
you
yes
that
what
i
do
said
the
spade
and
that
what
i
done
these
hundreds
of
years
waiting
for
you
boots
well
here
i
am
said
boots
again
as
he
took
the
spade
and
knocked
it
off
the
handle
and
put
it
into
his
wallet
and
then
returned
to
his
brothers
well
what
was
it
so
rare
and
strange
said
peter
and
paul
that
you
saw
up
there
at
the
top
of
the
rock
oh
said
boots
nothing
more
than
a
spade
that
was
what
we
heard
so
they
went
on
again
a
good
bit
until
they
came
to
a
brook
they
were
thirsty
all
three
after
their
long
walk
and
so
they
lay
down
beside
the
brook
to
have
a
drink
i
wonder
now
said
boots
where
all
this
water
comes
from
i
wonder
if
you
lost
the
little
sense
you
had
said
peter
and
paul
in
one
breath
where
the
brook
comes
from
indeed
have
you
never
heard
how
water
rises
from
a
spring
in
the
earth
yes
but
still
i
a
great
fancy
to
see
where
this
brook
comes
from
said
boots
so
along
beside
the
brook
he
went
in
spite
of
all
that
his
brothers
cried
after
him
nothing
could
stop
him
on
he
went
up
and
up
and
the
brook
got
smaller
and
smaller
and
at
last
a
little
way
farther
on
what
do
you
think
he
saw
why
a
great
walnut
and
out
of
that
the
water
trickled
said
boots
again
so
you
lie
here
and
trickle
and
run
down
all
alone
yes
i
do
said
the
walnut
and
here
have
i
trickled
and
run
these
hundreds
of
years
waiting
for
you
boots
well
here
i
am
said
boots
as
he
took
up
a
lump
of
moss
and
plugged
up
the
hole
that
the
water
might
not
run
out
then
he
put
the
walnut
into
his
wallet
and
ran
down
to
his
brothers
well
now
said
peter
and
paul
have
you
found
out
where
the
water
comes
from
a
rare
sight
it
must
have
been
oh
after
all
it
was
only
a
hole
it
ran
out
of
said
boots
and
so
the
others
laughed
and
made
fun
of
him
again
but
boots
did
mind
that
a
bit
after
all
i
had
the
fun
of
seeing
it
said
he
so
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
farther
they
came
to
the
king
palace
but
as
every
one
in
the
kingdom
had
heard
how
he
might
win
the
princess
and
half
the
realm
if
he
could
only
fell
the
big
oak
and
dig
the
well
so
many
had
come
to
try
their
luck
that
the
oak
was
now
twice
as
stout
and
big
as
it
had
been
at
first
for
two
chips
grew
for
every
one
they
hewed
out
with
their
axes
as
i
dare
say
you
remember
i
told
you
so
the
king
had
now
laid
down
as
a
punishment
that
if
any
one
tried
and
could
not
fell
the
oak
he
should
be
put
on
a
barren
island
much
like
a
prison
the
two
brothers
did
not
let
themselves
be
scared
by
that
however
for
they
were
quite
sure
they
could
fell
the
oak
and
peter
as
he
was
the
eldest
was
to
try
his
hand
first
but
it
went
with
him
as
with
all
the
rest
who
had
hewn
at
the
oak
for
every
chip
he
had
cut
out
two
grew
in
its
place
so
the
king
men
seized
him
bound
him
hand
and
foot
and
put
him
out
on
the
island
now
paul
was
to
try
his
luck
but
he
fared
just
the
same
when
he
had
hewn
two
or
three
strokes
they
began
to
see
the
oak
grow
and
so
the
king
men
seized
him
too
bound
him
hand
and
foot
and
put
him
out
on
the
island
and
now
boots
was
to
try
you
can
save
yourself
the
trouble
we
bind
you
and
send
you
off
after
your
brothers
just
as
well
first
as
last
laughed
the
king
men
well
i
just
like
to
try
first
said
boots
and
so
he
got
leave
then
he
took
his
axe
out
of
his
wallet
and
fitted
it
to
its
haft
hew
away
said
he
to
his
axe
and
away
it
hewed
making
the
chips
fly
so
that
it
was
long
before
down
came
the
oak
when
that
was
done
boots
pulled
out
his
spade
and
fitted
it
to
its
handle
dig
away
said
he
to
the
spade
and
the
spade
began
to
dig
and
delve
till
the
earth
and
rock
flew
out
in
splinters
and
he
had
the
well
soon
dug
out
as
you
may
believe
and
when
he
had
got
it
as
big
and
deep
as
he
chose
boots
took
out
his
walnut
and
laid
it
in
one
corner
of
the
well
and
pulled
the
plug
of
moss
out
trickle
and
run
said
boots
and
so
the
water
trickled
and
ran
till
it
gushed
out
of
the
hole
in
a
stream
and
in
a
short
time
the
well
was
brimful
then
boots
had
felled
the
oak
which
shaded
the
king
palace
and
dug
a
well
that
held
water
all
the
year
around
and
so
he
got
the
princess
and
half
the
kingdom
as
the
king
had
said
and
it
was
lucky
for
peter
and
paul
that
they
were
on
the
barren
island
else
they
had
heard
each
day
and
hour
how
every
one
said
well
after
all
boots
did
not
wonder
about
things
for
nothing
the
lad
who
went
to
the
north
wind
once
on
a
time
there
was
an
old
widow
who
had
one
son
and
as
she
was
feeble
and
weak
she
asked
her
son
to
go
out
to
the
storehouse
and
fetch
meal
for
cooking
but
when
he
got
outside
the
storehouse
and
was
just
going
down
the
steps
there
came
the
north
wind
puffing
and
blowing
caught
up
the
meal
and
away
with
it
through
the
air
then
the
lad
went
back
into
the
storehouse
for
more
but
when
he
came
out
again
on
the
steps
the
north
wind
came
again
and
carried
off
the
meal
with
a
puff
and
more
than
that
he
did
it
the
third
time
at
this
the
lad
got
very
angry
and
as
it
seemed
hard
that
the
north
wind
should
behave
so
he
thought
he
would
go
in
search
of
him
and
ask
him
to
give
up
his
meal
so
off
he
went
but
the
way
was
long
and
he
walked
and
walked
at
last
he
came
to
the
north
wind
house
said
the
lad
and
thank
you
for
coming
to
see
us
answered
the
north
wind
and
his
voice
was
loud
and
gruff
and
thanks
for
coming
to
see
me
what
do
you
want
oh
answered
the
lad
i
only
wished
to
ask
you
to
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
have
back
the
meal
you
took
from
me
on
the
storehouse
steps
for
we
have
much
to
live
on
and
if
you
to
go
on
snapping
up
the
morsel
we
have
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
starve
i
have
your
meal
said
the
north
wind
but
since
you
are
in
such
need
i
give
you
a
table
cloth
which
will
get
you
everything
you
want
you
need
only
say
spread
yourself
and
serve
up
all
kinds
of
good
dishes
with
this
the
lad
was
well
content
but
as
the
way
was
long
he
could
not
get
home
in
one
day
so
he
turned
into
an
inn
on
the
way
and
when
they
were
going
to
sit
down
to
supper
he
laid
the
cloth
on
the
table
which
stood
in
the
corner
and
said
cloth
spread
yourself
and
serve
up
all
kinds
of
good
dishes
he
had
scarcely
said
this
before
the
cloth
did
as
it
was
bid
and
all
who
stood
by
thought
it
a
fine
thing
but
most
of
all
the
landlord
so
when
all
were
fast
asleep
at
dead
of
night
he
took
the
lad
cloth
and
put
another
like
it
in
its
stead
but
this
could
not
so
much
as
serve
up
a
bit
of
dry
bread
when
the
lad
woke
he
took
the
cloth
and
went
off
with
it
and
that
day
he
got
home
to
his
mother
now
said
he
i
been
to
the
north
wind
house
and
a
good
fellow
he
is
for
he
gave
me
this
cloth
and
when
i
only
say
to
it
spread
yourself
and
serve
up
all
kinds
of
good
dishes
i
get
every
sort
of
food
i
please
all
very
true
i
dare
say
said
the
mother
but
seeing
is
believing
so
the
lad
made
haste
drew
out
a
table
laid
the
cloth
on
it
and
said
cloth
spread
yourself
and
serve
up
all
kinds
of
good
dishes
but
not
even
a
bit
of
dry
bread
did
the
cloth
serve
up
well
said
the
lad
there
no
help
for
it
but
to
go
to
the
north
wind
again
and
away
he
went
so
late
in
the
afternoon
he
came
to
where
the
north
wind
lived
good
evening
said
the
lad
good
evening
said
the
north
wind
i
want
my
rights
for
that
meal
of
ours
which
you
took
said
the
lad
for
as
for
that
cloth
i
got
it
is
worth
a
penny
i
have
no
meal
said
the
north
wind
but
you
may
have
the
ram
yonder
which
will
coin
gold
ducats
when
you
say
to
it
ram
ram
make
money
the
lad
thought
this
a
fine
thing
but
as
it
was
too
far
to
get
home
that
day
he
turned
in
for
the
night
to
the
same
inn
where
he
had
slept
the
first
time
before
he
called
for
anything
he
tried
what
the
north
wind
had
said
of
the
ram
and
found
it
all
true
when
the
landlord
saw
this
he
thought
it
a
fine
ram
and
when
the
lad
had
fallen
asleep
he
took
another
which
could
not
coin
even
a
penny
and
exchanged
the
two
next
morning
off
went
the
lad
and
when
he
got
home
to
his
mother
he
said
after
all
the
north
wind
is
a
jolly
fellow
for
now
he
has
given
me
a
ram
which
will
coin
golden
ducats
if
i
only
say
ram
make
money
all
very
true
i
dare
say
said
his
mother
but
i
sha
believe
it
until
i
see
the
ducats
made
ram
ram
make
money
said
the
lad
but
not
even
a
penny
did
the
ram
coin
so
the
lad
went
back
to
the
north
wind
and
scolded
him
and
said
the
ram
was
worth
nothing
and
he
must
have
his
rights
for
the
meal
well
said
the
north
wind
i
nothing
else
to
give
you
but
that
old
stick
in
the
corner
yonder
but
it
a
stick
of
such
a
kind
that
if
you
say
stick
lay
on
it
lays
on
till
you
say
stick
now
stop
so
the
lad
thanked
the
north
wind
and
went
his
way
and
as
the
road
was
long
he
turned
in
this
night
also
to
the
landlord
but
as
he
could
guess
pretty
well
how
things
stood
as
to
the
cloth
and
the
ram
he
lay
down
at
once
on
the
bench
and
began
to
snore
as
if
he
were
asleep
now
the
landlord
who
thought
surely
the
stick
must
be
worth
something
hunted
up
one
which
was
like
it
and
when
he
heard
the
lad
snore
he
was
going
to
exchange
the
two
but
just
as
the
landlord
was
about
to
take
it
the
lad
called
out
stick
stick
lay
on
so
the
stick
began
to
beat
the
landlord
till
he
jumped
over
chairs
and
tables
and
benches
and
yelled
and
roared
oh
my
oh
my
bid
the
stick
be
still
else
it
will
beat
me
to
death
you
shall
have
back
both
your
cloth
and
your
ram
when
the
lad
thought
the
landlord
had
had
enough
he
said
stick
stick
now
stop
then
he
took
the
cloth
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
and
went
home
with
his
stick
in
his
hand
leading
the
ram
by
a
cord
tied
around
its
horns
and
so
he
got
his
rights
for
the
meal
he
had
lost
the
giant
who
had
no
heart
in
his
body
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
king
who
had
seven
sons
six
of
them
were
stout
brave
lads
but
the
youngest
was
the
cinderlad
you
must
know
and
he
went
about
by
himself
neither
saying
nor
doing
much
best
of
all
he
liked
to
sit
by
the
hearth
and
watch
the
glowing
cinders
so
they
called
him
boots
and
thought
little
of
him
now
when
the
princes
were
grown
up
the
six
were
to
set
off
to
fetch
brides
for
themselves
as
for
boots
they
would
not
be
seen
with
him
so
he
was
to
stay
at
home
but
the
others
were
to
bring
back
a
bride
for
him
if
any
could
be
found
willing
to
marry
such
a
one
the
king
gave
the
six
the
finest
clothes
you
ever
set
eyes
upon
so
fine
that
the
light
gleamed
from
them
a
long
way
off
and
each
had
his
horse
which
cost
many
many
hundred
dollars
and
so
they
set
off
now
when
they
had
been
to
many
palaces
and
seen
many
princesses
they
came
to
a
king
who
had
six
daughters
such
lovely
king
daughters
they
had
never
seen
and
so
they
asked
them
to
be
their
brides
and
when
they
had
got
them
they
set
off
home
again
but
they
quite
forgot
that
they
were
to
bring
back
a
bride
for
boots
their
brother
who
was
staying
at
home
when
they
had
gone
a
good
bit
on
their
way
they
passed
close
by
a
steep
hillside
like
a
wall
where
was
a
giant
house
out
came
the
giant
and
set
his
eyes
upon
them
and
turned
them
all
into
stone
princes
princesses
and
all
now
the
king
waited
and
waited
for
his
six
sons
but
so
long
as
he
waited
so
long
they
stayed
away
so
he
fell
into
great
grief
and
said
he
would
never
know
what
it
was
to
be
happy
again
one
day
boots
said
to
the
king
i
been
thinking
to
ask
your
leave
to
set
out
and
find
my
brothers
nay
nay
said
his
father
that
would
be
of
no
use
for
you
are
not
clever
enough
better
stay
and
dig
in
the
ashes
all
your
life
but
boots
had
set
his
heart
upon
it
go
he
would
and
he
begged
and
pleaded
so
long
that
the
king
was
forced
to
let
him
go
he
gave
boots
an
old
nag
but
boots
did
not
care
a
pin
for
that
he
sprang
up
on
his
sorry
old
steed
farewell
father
he
said
i
come
back
never
fear
and
likely
enough
i
shall
bring
my
six
brothers
back
with
me
and
with
that
he
rode
off
when
he
had
ridden
a
while
he
came
to
a
raven
which
lay
in
the
road
and
flapped
its
wings
and
was
not
able
to
get
out
of
the
way
it
was
so
starved
oh
dear
friend
said
the
raven
give
me
a
little
food
and
i
help
you
again
at
your
utmost
need
i
have
much
food
said
the
prince
and
i
do
see
how
you
ever
be
able
to
help
me
but
still
i
can
spare
you
a
little
i
see
you
need
it
so
he
gave
the
raven
some
of
the
food
he
had
brought
with
him
now
when
he
had
gone
a
little
farther
he
came
to
a
brook
and
in
the
brook
lay
a
great
salmon
which
had
got
upon
a
dry
place
and
dashed
itself
about
and
could
not
get
into
the
water
again
oh
dear
friend
said
the
salmon
to
the
prince
help
me
out
into
the
water
again
and
i
help
you
at
your
utmost
need
well
said
the
prince
the
help
you
give
me
will
not
be
great
i
daresay
but
it
a
pity
you
should
be
there
and
choke
and
with
that
he
shot
the
fish
out
into
the
stream
again
after
that
he
went
on
a
long
long
way
and
there
met
him
a
wolf
which
was
so
famished
that
it
lay
and
crawled
along
the
road
dear
friend
do
let
me
have
some
food
said
the
wolf
i
so
hungry
that
the
wind
whistles
through
my
ribs
i
had
nothing
to
eat
these
two
years
when
i
have
eaten
you
can
ride
upon
my
back
and
i
help
you
again
in
your
utmost
need
well
the
help
i
shall
get
from
you
will
not
be
great
i
be
bound
said
the
prince
but
you
may
take
all
i
have
since
you
are
in
such
great
need
illustration
never
had
the
prince
had
such
a
ride
in
his
life
so
when
the
wolf
had
eaten
the
food
boots
took
the
bit
and
put
it
between
the
wolf
jaws
and
laid
the
saddle
on
his
back
and
away
they
went
like
the
wind
never
had
the
prince
had
such
a
ride
before
when
we
have
gone
still
farther
said
graylegs
i
show
you
the
giant
house
and
after
a
while
they
came
to
it
see
here
is
the
giant
house
said
the
wolf
and
see
here
are
your
six
brothers
whom
the
giant
has
turned
to
stone
and
see
here
are
their
six
brides
yonder
is
the
door
and
in
at
that
door
you
must
go
when
you
get
in
you
find
a
princess
and
she
tell
you
what
to
do
to
make
an
end
of
the
giant
only
mind
you
do
as
she
bids
you
well
boots
went
in
but
truth
to
say
he
was
very
much
afraid
the
giant
was
away
but
in
one
of
the
rooms
sat
the
princess
just
as
the
wolf
had
said
and
so
lovely
a
princess
boots
had
never
set
eyes
upon
oh
heaven
help
you
whence
have
you
come
said
the
princess
as
she
saw
him
it
will
surely
be
your
death
no
one
can
make
an
end
of
the
giant
who
lives
here
he
is
a
most
cruel
monster
and
he
has
no
heart
in
his
body
well
well
said
boots
but
now
that
i
am
here
i
may
as
well
try
what
i
can
do
with
him
and
i
will
see
if
i
ca
free
my
brothers
who
have
been
turned
to
stone
and
you
too
i
will
try
to
save
that
i
will
well
if
you
must
you
must
said
the
princess
so
let
us
see
if
we
ca
hit
upon
a
plan
just
creep
under
the
bed
yonder
and
mind
you
listen
to
what
he
and
i
talk
about
but
pray
do
lie
as
still
as
a
mouse
so
he
crept
under
the
bed
and
he
had
scarce
got
well
underneath
before
the
giant
came
ha
roared
the
giant
what
a
smell
of
christian
blood
there
is
in
the
house
yes
i
know
there
is
said
the
princess
for
there
came
a
crow
flying
with
a
man
bone
and
let
it
fall
down
the
chimney
i
made
all
the
haste
i
could
to
get
it
out
but
all
one
can
do
the
smell
does
go
so
soon
so
the
giant
said
no
more
about
it
and
when
night
came
they
went
to
bed
after
they
had
lain
a
while
the
princess
said
there
is
one
thing
i
be
glad
to
ask
you
about
if
i
only
dared
what
thing
is
that
asked
the
giant
only
this
where
do
you
keep
your
heart
since
you
do
carry
it
about
you
said
the
princess
ah
that
a
thing
you
no
business
to
ask
about
but
if
you
must
know
it
lies
under
the
door
sill
said
the
giant
ho
ho
said
boots
to
himself
under
the
bed
then
we
soon
see
if
we
ca
find
it
next
morning
the
giant
got
up
very
early
and
strode
off
to
the
wood
but
he
was
hardly
out
of
the
house
before
boots
and
the
princess
set
to
work
to
look
under
the
door
sill
for
this
heart
but
the
more
they
dug
and
the
more
they
hunted
the
more
they
could
find
it
he
has
balked
us
this
time
said
the
princess
but
we
try
him
once
more
so
she
picked
all
the
prettiest
flowers
she
could
find
and
strewed
them
over
the
door
sill
which
they
had
laid
in
its
right
place
again
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
giant
to
come
home
boots
crept
under
the
bed
just
as
he
was
well
under
back
came
the
giant
went
the
giant
nose
my
eyes
and
limbs
what
a
smell
of
christian
blood
there
is
in
here
said
he
i
know
there
is
said
the
princess
for
there
came
a
crow
flying
with
a
man
bone
in
his
bill
and
let
it
fall
down
the
chimney
i
made
as
much
haste
as
i
could
to
get
it
out
but
i
dare
say
it
that
you
smell
so
the
giant
held
his
peace
and
said
no
more
about
it
a
little
while
after
he
asked
who
it
was
that
had
strewed
flowers
about
the
door
sill
oh
i
of
course
said
the
princess
and
pray
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
said
the
giant
ah
said
the
princess
i
strewed
them
there
when
i
knew
your
heart
lay
under
there
you
do
say
so
said
the
giant
but
after
all
it
does
lie
there
at
all
so
when
they
went
to
bed
in
the
evening
the
princess
asked
the
giant
again
where
his
heart
was
for
she
said
she
would
so
much
like
to
know
well
said
the
giant
if
you
must
know
it
lies
away
yonder
in
the
cupboard
against
the
wall
so
so
thought
boots
and
the
princess
then
we
will
soon
find
it
next
morning
the
giant
was
away
early
and
strode
off
to
the
wood
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
boots
and
the
princess
were
in
the
cupboard
hunting
for
the
heart
but
the
more
they
looked
for
it
the
less
they
found
it
well
said
the
princess
we
just
try
him
once
more
so
she
decked
the
cupboard
with
flowers
and
garlands
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
giant
to
come
home
boots
crept
under
the
bed
again
then
back
came
the
giant
my
eyes
and
limbs
what
a
smell
of
christian
blood
there
is
in
here
i
know
there
is
said
the
princess
for
a
little
while
since
there
came
a
crow
flying
with
a
man
bone
in
his
bill
and
let
it
fall
down
the
chimney
i
made
all
the
haste
i
could
to
get
it
out
of
the
house
but
after
all
my
pains
i
dare
say
it
that
you
smell
when
the
giant
heard
that
he
said
no
more
about
it
but
after
a
while
he
saw
how
the
cupboard
was
all
decked
about
with
flowers
and
garlands
and
he
asked
who
it
was
that
had
done
that
who
could
it
be
but
the
princess
and
pray
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
foolishness
asked
the
giant
oh
i
could
help
doing
it
when
i
knew
your
heart
lay
there
said
the
princess
how
can
you
be
so
silly
as
to
believe
any
such
thing
said
the
giant
how
can
i
help
believing
it
when
you
say
it
said
the
princess
you
a
goose
said
the
giant
where
my
heart
is
you
will
never
come
yet
for
all
that
said
the
princess
it
would
be
such
a
pleasure
to
know
where
it
really
lies
then
the
poor
giant
could
hold
out
no
longer
but
said
far
far
away
in
a
lake
lies
an
island
on
that
island
stands
a
church
in
that
church
is
a
well
in
that
well
swims
a
duck
in
that
duck
there
is
an
egg
and
in
that
egg
there
lies
my
heart
in
the
morning
early
while
it
was
still
gray
dawn
the
giant
strode
off
to
the
wood
now
i
must
set
off
too
said
boots
if
i
only
knew
how
to
find
the
way
he
took
a
long
farewell
of
the
princess
and
when
he
slipped
out
of
the
giant
door
there
stood
the
wolf
waiting
for
him
boots
told
him
all
that
had
happened
and
said
now
he
wished
to
ride
to
the
well
inside
the
church
if
only
he
knew
the
way
the
wolf
bade
him
jump
on
his
back
and
away
they
went
over
hill
and
dale
over
hedge
and
field
till
the
wind
whistled
after
them
after
they
had
travelled
many
many
days
they
came
at
last
to
the
lake
then
the
prince
did
not
know
how
to
get
across
but
the
wolf
bade
him
not
to
be
afraid
but
to
hold
fast
so
he
jumped
into
the
lake
with
the
prince
on
his
back
and
swam
over
to
the
island
when
they
came
to
the
church
the
church
keys
hung
high
high
up
on
the
top
of
the
tower
and
the
prince
knew
not
how
to
get
them
down
call
upon
the
raven
said
the
wolf
so
the
prince
called
upon
the
raven
and
immediately
the
raven
came
and
flew
up
and
fetched
the
keys
and
so
the
prince
got
into
the
church
when
he
came
to
the
well
there
was
the
duck
which
swam
about
forward
and
backward
just
as
the
giant
had
said
so
the
prince
stood
and
coaxed
it
and
coaxed
it
till
finally
it
came
to
him
and
he
grasped
it
in
his
hand
but
just
as
he
lifted
it
up
from
the
water
the
duck
dropped
the
egg
in
the
well
and
then
boots
was
beside
himself
to
know
how
to
get
it
out
again
now
call
upon
the
salmon
said
the
wolf
and
boots
called
upon
the
salmon
and
the
salmon
came
and
fetched
up
the
egg
from
the
bottom
of
the
well
then
the
wolf
told
him
to
squeeze
the
egg
and
as
soon
as
he
squeezed
the
egg
the
giant
screamed
and
begged
and
prayed
to
be
spared
saying
he
would
do
all
that
the
prince
wished
if
he
would
only
not
squeeze
his
heart
in
two
tell
him
to
restore
to
life
again
your
six
brothers
and
their
brides
whom
he
has
turned
to
stone
said
the
wolf
yes
the
giant
was
ready
to
do
that
and
he
turned
the
six
brothers
into
king
sons
again
and
their
brides
into
king
daughters
then
boots
left
the
giant
heart
on
the
altar
of
the
church
that
took
all
the
evil
power
from
the
cruel
giant
and
i
have
never
heard
of
him
since
and
now
boots
rode
back
again
on
the
wolf
to
the
giant
house
and
there
stood
all
his
six
brothers
alive
and
merry
with
their
brides
then
boots
went
into
the
hillside
after
his
bride
and
they
all
set
off
home
again
to
their
father
house
and
you
may
fancy
how
glad
the
old
king
was
when
he
saw
his
seven
sons
come
back
each
with
his
bride
but
the
loveliest
bride
is
the
bride
of
boots
after
all
said
the
king
and
he
shall
sit
highest
at
the
table
with
her
by
his
side
so
they
had
a
great
wedding
feast
and
the
mirth
was
both
loud
and
long
and
if
they
have
not
done
feasting
why
they
are
at
it
still
the
sheep
and
the
pig
who
set
up
housekeeping
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
sheep
who
stood
in
the
pen
to
be
fattened
so
he
lived
well
and
was
stuffed
and
crammed
with
everything
that
was
good
till
one
day
the
dairymaid
came
to
give
him
still
more
food
then
she
said
eat
away
sheep
you
wo
be
here
much
longer
we
are
going
to
kill
you
the
sheep
thought
over
this
for
a
while
and
then
he
ate
till
he
was
ready
to
burst
and
when
he
was
crammed
full
he
butted
out
the
door
of
the
pen
and
took
his
way
to
the
neighboring
farm
there
he
went
to
see
a
pig
whom
he
had
known
out
on
the
common
and
with
whom
he
had
always
been
very
friendly
said
the
sheep
do
you
know
why
it
is
you
are
so
well
off
and
why
it
is
they
fatten
you
and
take
such
pains
with
you
no
i
do
said
the
pig
well
i
know
they
are
going
to
kill
and
eat
you
said
the
sheep
are
they
said
the
pig
and
what
is
there
to
be
done
about
it
if
you
will
do
as
i
do
said
the
sheep
we
go
off
to
the
wood
build
us
a
house
and
set
up
for
ourselves
yes
the
pig
was
willing
enough
good
company
is
such
a
comfort
he
said
and
so
the
two
set
off
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
they
met
a
goose
good
sirs
and
whither
away
so
fast
said
the
goose
said
the
sheep
we
are
going
to
set
up
for
ourselves
in
the
wood
for
you
know
every
man
house
is
his
castle
well
said
the
goose
i
should
so
much
like
a
home
of
my
own
too
may
i
go
with
you
with
gossip
and
gabble
is
built
neither
house
nor
stable
said
the
pig
let
us
know
what
you
can
do
i
can
pluck
moss
and
stuff
it
into
the
seams
between
the
planks
and
the
house
will
be
tight
and
warm
yes
they
would
give
him
leave
for
above
all
things
piggy
wished
to
be
warm
and
comfortable
so
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
farther
the
goose
had
hard
work
to
walk
so
fast
they
met
a
hare
who
came
frisking
out
of
the
wood
good
sirs
she
said
how
far
are
you
trotting
said
the
sheep
we
going
to
the
wood
to
build
us
a
house
and
set
up
for
ourselves
for
you
know
try
all
the
world
around
there
nothing
like
home
as
for
that
said
the
hare
i
have
a
house
in
every
bush
but
yet
i
have
often
said
in
winter
i
only
live
till
summer
i
build
me
a
house
and
so
i
have
half
a
mind
to
go
with
you
and
build
one
after
all
yes
said
the
pig
if
we
ever
get
into
trouble
we
might
use
you
to
scare
away
the
dogs
for
i
do
fancy
you
could
help
us
in
do
make
fun
of
me
i
have
teeth
to
gnaw
pegs
and
paws
to
drive
them
into
the
wall
so
i
can
very
well
set
up
to
be
carpenter
said
the
hare
so
he
too
got
leave
to
go
with
them
and
help
to
build
their
house
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
about
it
when
they
had
gone
a
bit
farther
they
met
a
cock
good
sirs
said
the
cock
whither
are
you
going
gentlemen
said
the
sheep
we
are
going
off
to
the
wood
to
build
a
house
and
set
up
for
ourselves
for
you
know
good
to
travel
east
and
west
but
after
all
a
home
is
best
well
said
the
cock
if
i
might
have
leave
to
join
such
a
gallant
company
i
also
would
like
to
go
to
the
wood
and
build
a
house
ay
ay
said
the
pig
but
how
can
you
help
us
build
a
house
oh
said
the
cock
what
would
you
do
without
a
cock
i
am
up
early
and
i
wake
every
one
very
true
said
the
pig
let
him
come
with
us
sleep
is
the
biggest
thief
he
said
he
thinks
nothing
of
stealing
half
one
life
so
they
all
set
off
to
the
wood
together
and
built
a
house
the
pig
hewed
the
timber
and
the
sheep
drew
it
home
the
hare
was
carpenter
and
gnawed
pegs
and
bolts
and
hammered
them
into
the
walls
and
roof
the
goose
plucked
moss
and
stuffed
it
into
the
seams
the
cock
crew
and
looked
out
that
they
did
not
oversleep
themselves
in
the
morning
and
when
the
house
was
ready
and
the
roof
lined
with
birch
bark
and
thatched
with
turf
there
they
lived
by
themselves
and
were
merry
and
well
but
you
must
know
that
a
bit
farther
on
in
the
wood
was
a
wolf
den
and
there
lived
two
graylegs
when
they
saw
that
a
new
house
had
been
built
near
by
they
wanted
to
become
acquainted
with
their
neighbors
one
of
them
made
up
an
errand
and
went
into
the
new
house
and
asked
for
a
light
for
his
pipe
but
as
soon
as
he
got
inside
the
door
the
sheep
gave
him
such
a
butt
that
he
fell
head
foremost
into
the
hearth
then
the
pig
began
to
bite
him
and
the
goose
to
nip
and
peck
him
and
the
cock
upon
the
roost
to
crow
and
chatter
and
as
for
the
hare
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
ran
about
aloft
and
on
the
floor
and
scratched
and
scrambled
in
every
corner
of
the
house
so
after
a
time
the
wolf
came
out
well
said
the
one
who
waited
for
him
outside
you
must
have
been
well
received
since
you
stayed
so
long
but
what
became
of
the
light
you
have
neither
pipe
nor
smoke
yes
yes
said
the
other
a
pleasant
company
indeed
as
soon
as
i
got
inside
the
door
the
shoemaker
began
to
beat
me
with
his
last
so
that
i
fell
head
foremost
into
the
open
fire
and
there
sat
two
smiths
who
blew
the
bellows
and
made
the
sparks
fly
and
struck
and
punched
me
with
tongs
and
pincers
as
for
the
hunter
he
went
scrambling
about
looking
for
his
gun
and
it
was
good
luck
he
did
not
find
it
and
all
the
while
there
was
another
who
sat
up
under
the
roof
and
slapped
his
arms
and
cried
out
him
hither
drag
him
hither
that
was
what
he
screamed
and
if
he
had
only
got
hold
of
me
i
should
never
have
come
out
alive
the
wolves
never
went
calling
on
their
neighbors
any
more
the
parson
and
the
clerk
there
was
once
a
parson
who
was
such
a
bully
that
whenever
he
met
anyone
driving
on
the
king
highway
he
called
out
ever
so
far
off
out
of
the
way
out
of
the
way
here
comes
the
parson
one
day
when
he
was
driving
along
and
behaving
so
he
met
the
king
out
of
the
way
out
of
the
way
he
bawled
a
long
way
off
but
the
king
drove
on
and
held
his
own
so
it
was
the
parson
who
had
to
turn
his
horse
aside
that
time
and
when
the
king
came
up
beside
him
he
said
you
shall
come
to
me
at
the
palace
and
if
you
ca
answer
three
questions
which
i
shall
ask
you
you
shall
lose
your
office
for
your
pride
sake
this
was
something
quite
different
from
what
the
parson
was
wont
to
hear
he
could
bawl
and
bully
shout
and
scold
all
that
he
could
do
but
question
and
answer
were
not
in
his
line
so
he
set
off
to
the
clerk
who
was
said
to
be
worth
more
than
the
parson
and
told
him
he
had
no
mind
to
go
to
the
king
for
one
fool
can
ask
more
than
ten
wise
men
can
answer
and
the
end
was
he
got
the
clerk
to
go
in
his
place
yes
the
clerk
set
off
and
came
to
the
palace
in
the
parson
clothes
there
the
king
met
him
out
on
the
porch
with
crown
and
sceptre
and
he
was
so
grand
he
fairly
glittered
and
gleamed
well
are
you
there
said
the
king
tell
me
first
said
the
king
how
far
the
east
is
from
the
west
just
a
day
journey
said
the
clerk
how
is
that
asked
the
king
do
you
know
said
the
clerk
that
the
sun
rises
in
the
east
and
sets
in
the
west
and
he
does
it
just
nicely
in
a
day
very
well
said
the
king
but
tell
me
now
what
you
think
i
am
worth
as
you
see
me
stand
here
well
said
the
clerk
our
lord
was
valued
at
thirty
pieces
of
silver
so
i
do
think
i
can
set
your
price
higher
than
all
very
fine
said
the
king
but
as
you
are
so
wise
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
what
i
am
thinking
about
now
oh
said
the
clerk
you
are
thinking
it
the
parson
who
stands
before
you
but
there
where
you
are
mistaken
for
i
am
the
clerk
be
off
home
with
you
said
the
king
and
be
you
parson
and
let
him
be
clerk
and
so
it
was
father
bruin
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
who
lived
far
far
away
in
the
wood
he
had
many
many
goats
and
sheep
but
never
a
one
could
he
keep
because
of
greylegs
the
wolf
at
last
he
said
i
soon
trap
greyboots
and
so
he
set
to
work
to
dig
a
pitfall
when
he
had
dug
it
deep
enough
he
put
a
pole
down
in
the
midst
of
the
pit
and
on
the
top
of
the
pole
he
set
a
board
and
on
the
board
he
put
a
little
dog
over
the
pit
itself
he
spread
boughs
and
branches
and
leaves
and
other
rubbish
and
of
all
he
strewed
snow
so
that
greylegs
might
not
see
that
there
was
a
pit
underneath
so
when
night
came
on
the
little
dog
grew
weary
of
sitting
there
he
said
and
bayed
at
the
moon
just
then
up
came
a
fox
prowling
and
sneaking
and
thought
here
was
a
fine
time
for
marketing
and
with
that
gave
a
jump
head
over
heels
down
into
the
pitfall
and
when
it
got
a
little
farther
on
in
the
night
the
little
dog
grew
so
weary
and
so
hungry
and
it
fell
to
yelping
and
howling
he
cried
out
just
at
that
very
moment
up
came
greylegs
trotting
and
trotting
he
too
thought
he
should
get
a
fat
steak
and
he
too
made
a
spring
head
over
heels
down
into
the
pitfall
when
it
was
getting
on
towards
grey
dawn
in
the
morning
down
fell
the
snow
with
a
north
wind
and
it
grew
so
cold
that
the
little
dog
stood
and
shivered
and
shook
he
was
so
weary
and
hungry
he
called
out
and
barked
and
yelped
and
howled
then
up
came
a
bear
tramping
and
tramping
along
and
thought
to
himself
how
he
could
get
a
morsel
for
breakfast
at
the
very
top
of
the
morning
and
so
he
thought
and
thought
among
the
boughs
and
branches
till
he
too
went
bump
head
over
heels
down
into
the
pitfall
so
when
it
got
a
little
farther
on
in
the
morning
an
old
beggar
wife
came
walking
by
who
toddled
from
farm
to
farm
with
a
bag
on
her
back
when
she
set
eyes
on
the
little
dog
that
stood
there
and
howled
she
could
not
help
going
near
to
look
and
see
if
any
wild
beasts
had
fallen
into
the
pit
during
the
night
so
she
crawled
up
on
her
knees
and
peeped
down
into
it
art
thou
come
into
the
pit
at
last
reynard
she
said
to
the
fox
for
he
was
the
first
she
saw
a
very
good
place
too
for
such
a
robber
as
thou
and
thou
too
she
said
to
the
wolf
many
a
goat
and
sheep
hast
thou
torn
and
rent
and
now
thou
shalt
be
plagued
and
punished
to
death
bless
my
heart
thou
too
bruin
art
thou
too
sitting
in
this
room
thou
horse
killer
thee
too
will
we
strip
and
thee
shall
we
flay
and
thy
skull
shall
be
nailed
up
on
the
wall
all
this
the
old
lass
screeched
out
as
she
bent
over
towards
the
bear
but
just
then
her
bag
fell
over
her
ears
and
dragged
her
down
and
slap
down
went
the
old
woman
head
over
heels
into
the
pitfall
so
there
they
all
four
sat
and
glared
at
one
another
each
in
a
corner
reynard
in
one
greylegs
in
another
bruin
in
a
third
and
the
old
woman
in
a
fourth
but
as
soon
as
it
was
broad
daylight
reynard
began
to
peep
and
peer
and
to
twist
and
turn
about
for
he
thought
he
might
as
well
try
to
get
out
but
the
old
lass
cried
out
canst
thou
not
sit
still
thou
whirligig
thief
and
not
go
twisting
and
turning
only
look
at
father
bruin
himself
in
the
corner
how
he
sits
as
grave
as
a
judge
for
now
she
thought
she
might
as
well
make
friends
with
the
bear
but
just
then
up
came
the
man
who
owned
the
pitfall
first
he
drew
up
the
old
woman
and
after
that
he
slew
all
the
beasts
and
neither
spared
father
bruin
himself
in
the
corner
nor
nor
reynard
the
whirligig
thief
that
night
at
least
he
thought
he
had
made
a
good
haul
the
pancake
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
woman
who
had
seven
hungry
children
and
she
was
frying
a
pancake
for
them
it
was
a
sweet
milk
pancake
and
there
it
lay
in
the
pan
bubbling
and
frizzling
so
thick
and
good
it
was
a
delight
to
look
at
it
and
the
children
stood
round
about
and
the
old
father
sat
by
and
looked
on
oh
give
me
a
bit
of
pancake
mother
dear
i
am
so
hungry
said
one
child
oh
darling
mother
said
the
second
oh
darling
good
mother
said
the
third
oh
darling
good
sweet
mother
said
the
fourth
oh
darling
pretty
good
sweet
mother
said
the
fifth
oh
darling
pretty
good
sweet
clever
mother
said
the
sixth
oh
darling
pretty
good
sweet
clever
kindest
little
mother
said
the
seventh
so
they
begged
for
the
pancake
all
around
the
one
more
prettily
than
the
other
for
they
were
so
hungry
and
so
good
yes
yes
children
only
bide
a
bit
till
it
turns
itself
she
ought
to
have
said
i
can
get
it
turned
and
then
you
shall
have
some
lovely
sweet
milk
pancake
only
look
how
fat
and
happy
it
lies
there
when
the
pancake
heard
all
this
it
became
afraid
and
in
a
trice
it
turned
itself
and
tried
to
jump
out
of
the
pan
but
it
fell
back
into
it
again
the
other
side
up
when
it
had
been
fried
a
little
on
the
other
side
too
till
it
got
firm
and
stiff
it
jumped
out
of
the
pan
to
the
floor
and
rolled
off
like
a
wheel
through
the
door
and
down
the
hill
holloa
stop
pancake
and
away
ran
the
mother
after
it
with
the
frying
pan
in
one
hand
and
the
ladle
in
the
other
as
fast
as
she
could
and
all
the
children
behind
her
while
the
old
father
on
crutches
limped
after
them
last
of
all
hi
wo

stop

it

pancake
they
all
screamed
out
one
after
another
and
tried
to
catch
it
on
the
run
and
hold
it
but
the
pancake
rolled
on
and
on
and
in
a
twinkling
of
an
eye
it
was
so
far
ahead
that
they
could
see
it
so
when
it
had
rolled

said
the
pancake
and
it
rolled
and
rolled
as
fast
as
ever
so
when
it
had
rolled
a
long
long
time
it
met
a
pig
pancake
said
the
pig
the
same
to
you
piggy
wiggy
said
the
pancake
and
without
a
word
more
it
began
to
roll
and
roll
for
dear
life
nay
nay
said
the
pig
you
need
be
in
such
a
hurry
we
two
can
go
side
by
side
through
the
wood
they
say
it
is
not
too
safe
in
there
the
pancake
thought
there
might
be
something
in
that
and
so
they
kept
company
but
when
they
had
gone
a
while
they
came
to
a
brook
as
for
piggy
he
was
so
fat
he
could
swim
across
it
was
nothing
for
him
but
the
poor
pancake
could
not
get
over
seat
yourself
on
my
snout
said
the
pig
and
i
carry
you
over
so
the
pancake
did
that
ouf
ouf
said
the
pig
and
swallowed
the
pancake
at
one
gulp
and
then
as
the
poor
pancake
could
go
no
farther
why
this
story
can
go
no
farther
either
why
the
sea
is
salt
once
on
a
time
but
it
was
a
long
long
time
ago
there
were
two
brothers
one
rich
and
one
poor
now
one
christmas
eve
the
poor
one
had
not
so
much
as
a
crumb
in
the
house
either
of
meat
or
bread
so
he
went
to
his
brother
to
ask
him
for
something
with
which
to
keep
christmas
it
was
not
the
first
time
his
brother
had
been
forced
to
help
him
and
as
he
was
always
stingy
he
was
not
very
glad
to
see
him
this
time
but
he
said
i
give
you
a
whole
piece
of
bacon
two
loaves
of
bread
and
candles
into
the
bargain
if
you
never
bother
me
again
but
mind
you
do
set
foot
in
my
house
from
this
day
on
the
poor
brother
said
he
would
thanked
his
brother
for
the
help
he
had
given
him
and
started
on
his
way
home
he
had
gone
far
before
he
met
an
old
old
man
with
a
white
beard
who
looked
so
thin
and
worn
and
hungry
that
it
was
pitiful
to
see
him
in
heaven
name
give
a
poor
man
a
morsel
to
eat
said
the
old
man
now
indeed
i
have
been
begging
myself
said
the
poor
brother
but
i
not
so
poor
that
i
ca
give
you
something
on
the
blessed
christmas
eve
and
with
that
he
handed
the
old
man
a
candle
a
loaf
of
bread
and
he
was
just
going
to
cut
off
a
slice
of
bacon
when
the
old
man
stopped
him
that
is
enough
and
to
spare
said
he
and
now
i
tell
you
something
not
far
from
here
is
the
entrance
to
the
home
of
the
underground
folks
they
have
a
mill
there
which
can
grind
out
anything
they
wish
for
except
bacon
now
mind
you
go
there
when
you
get
inside
they
will
all
want
to
buy
your
bacon
but
do
sell
it
unless
you
get
in
return
the
mill
which
stands
behind
the
door
when
you
come
out
teach
you
how
to
handle
the
mill
so
the
man
with
the
bacon
thanked
the
other
for
his
good
advice
and
followed
the
directions
which
the
old
man
had
given
him
and
soon
he
stood
outside
the
door
of
the
hillfolk
home
when
he
got
in
everything
went
just
as
the
old
man
had
said
all
the
hillfolk
great
and
small
came
swarming
up
to
him
like
ants
around
an
and
each
tried
to
outbid
the
other
for
the
bacon
well
said
the
man
by
rights
my
old
dame
and
i
ought
to
have
this
bacon
for
our
christmas
dinner
but
since
you
have
all
set
your
hearts
on
it
i
suppose
i
must
give
it
up
to
you
now
if
i
sell
it
at
all
i
have
for
it
that
mill
behind
the
door
yonder
at
first
the
hillfolk
would
hear
of
such
a
bargain
and
higgled
and
haggled
with
the
man
but
he
stuck
to
what
he
said
and
at
last
they
gave
up
the
mill
for
the
bacon
when
the
man
got
out
of
the
cave
and
into
the
woods
again
he
met
the
same
old
beggar
and
asked
him
how
to
handle
the
mill
after
he
had
learned
how
to
use
it
he
thanked
the
old
man
and
went
off
home
as
fast
as
he
could
but
still
the
clock
had
struck
twelve
on
christmas
eve
before
he
reached
his
own
door
wherever
in
the
world
have
you
been
said
his
old
dame
here
have
i
sat
hour
after
hour
waiting
and
watching
without
so
much
as
two
sticks
to
lay
together
under
the
christmas
porridge
oh
said
the
man
i
could
not
get
back
before
for
i
had
to
go
a
long
way
first
for
one
thing
and
then
for
another
but
now
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
so
he
put
the
mill
on
the
table
and
bade
it
first
of
all
grind
lights
then
a
tablecloth
then
meat
then
ale
and
so
on
till
they
had
everything
that
was
nice
for
christmas
fare
he
had
only
to
speak
the
word
and
the
mill
ground
out
whatever
he
wanted
the
old
dame
stood
by
blessing
her
stars
and
kept
on
asking
where
he
had
got
this
wonderful
mill
but
he
would
tell
her
it
all
the
same
where
i
got
it
you
see
the
mill
is
a
good
one
and
the
mill
stream
never
freezes
that
enough
so
he
ground
meat
and
drink
and
all
good
things
to
last
out
the
whole
of
christmas
holidays
and
on
the
third
day
he
asked
all
his
friends
and
kin
to
his
house
and
gave
them
a
great
feast
now
when
his
rich
brother
saw
all
that
was
on
the
table
and
all
that
was
in
the
cupboards
he
grew
quite
wild
with
anger
for
he
could
not
bear
that
his
brother
should
have
anything
was
only
on
christmas
eve
he
said
to
the
rest
he
was
so
poorly
off
that
he
came
and
begged
for
a
morsel
of
food
and
now
he
gives
a
feast
as
if
he
were
count
or
a
king
and
he
turned
to
his
brother
and
said
but
where
in
the
world
did
you
get
all
this
wealth
from
behind
the
door
answered
the
owner
of
the
mill
for
he
did
not
care
to
tell
his
brother
much
about
it
but
later
in
the
evening
when
he
had
gotten
a
little
too
merry
he
could
keep
his
secret
no
longer
and
he
brought
out
the
mill
and
said
there
you
see
what
has
gotten
me
all
this
wealth
and
so
he
made
the
mill
grind
all
kinds
of
things
when
his
brother
saw
it
he
set
his
heart
on
having
the
mill
and
after
some
talk
it
was
agreed
that
the
rich
brother
was
to
get
it
at
time
when
he
was
to
pay
three
hundred
dollars
for
it
now
you
may
fancy
the
mill
did
not
grow
rusty
for
want
of
work
for
while
he
had
it
the
poor
brother
made
it
grind
meat
and
drink
that
would
last
for
years
when
came
the
rich
brother
got
it
but
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
make
it
grind
that
he
forgot
to
learn
how
to
handle
it
it
was
evening
when
the
rich
brother
got
the
mill
home
and
next
morning
he
told
his
wife
to
go
out
into
the
hayfield
and
toss
hay
while
the
mowers
cut
the
grass
and
he
would
stay
at
home
and
get
the
dinner
ready
so
when
dinner
time
drew
near
he
put
the
mill
on
the
kitchen
table
and
said
grind
herrings
and
broth
and
grind
them
good
and
fast
and
the
mill
began
to
grind
herrings
and
broth
first
of
all
the
dishes
full
then
all
the
tubs
full
and
so
on
till
the
kitchen
floor
was
quite
covered
the
man
twisted
and
twirled
at
the
mill
to
get
it
to
stop
but
for
all
his
fiddling
and
fumbling
the
mill
went
on
grinding
and
in
a
little
while
the
broth
rose
so
high
that
the
man
was
nearly
drowning
so
he
threw
open
the
kitchen
door
and
ran
into
the
parlor
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
mill
had
ground
the
parlor
full
too
and
it
was
only
at
the
risk
of
his
life
that
the
man
could
get
hold
of
the
latch
of
the
house
door
through
the
stream
of
broth
when
he
got
the
door
open
he
ran
out
and
set
off
down
the
road
with
the
stream
of
herrings
and
broth
at
his
heels
roaring
like
a
waterfall
over
the
whole
farm
now
his
old
dame
who
was
in
the
field
tossing
hay
thought
it
a
long
time
to
dinner
and
at
last
she
said
well
though
the
master
does
call
us
home
we
may
as
well
go
maybe
he
finds
it
hard
work
to
boil
the
broth
and
will
be
glad
of
my
help
the
men
were
willing
enough
so
they
sauntered
homewards
but
just
as
they
had
got
a
little
way
up
the
hill
what
should
they
meet
but
herrings
and
broth
all
running
and
dashing
and
splashing
together
in
a
stream
and
the
master
himself
running
before
them
for
his
life
and
as
he
passed
them
he
called
out
eat
drink
eat
drink
but
take
care
you
not
drowned
in
the
broth
away
he
ran
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
to
his
brother
house
and
begged
him
in
heaven
name
to
take
back
the
mill
and
that
at
once
for
said
he
if
it
grinds
only
one
hour
more
the
whole
parish
will
be
swallowed
up
by
herrings
and
broth
so
the
poor
brother
took
back
the
mill
and
it
was
long
before
it
stopped
grinding
herrings
and
broth
illustration
with
the
herrings
and
broth
at
his
heels
and
now
he
set
up
a
farmhouse
far
finer
than
the
one
in
which
his
brother
lived
and
with
the
mill
he
ground
so
much
gold
that
he
covered
it
with
plates
of
gold
and
as
the
farm
lay
by
the
seaside
the
golden
house
gleamed
and
glistened
far
away
over
the
sea
all
who
sailed
by
put
ashore
to
see
the
rich
man
in
the
golden
house
and
to
see
the
wonderful
mill
the
fame
of
which
spread
far
and
wide
till
there
was
nobody
who
had
heard
of
it
so
one
day
there
came
a
skipper
who
wanted
to
see
the
mill
and
the
first
thing
he
asked
was
if
it
could
grind
salt
grind
salt
said
the
owner
i
should
just
think
it
could
it
can
grind
anything
when
the
skipper
heard
that
he
said
he
must
have
the
mill
for
if
he
only
had
it
he
thought
he
need
not
take
his
long
voyages
across
stormy
seas
for
a
lading
of
salt
he
much
preferred
sitting
at
home
with
a
pipe
and
a
glass
well
the
man
let
him
have
it
but
the
skipper
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
with
it
that
he
had
no
time
to
ask
how
to
handle
the
mill
he
got
on
board
his
ship
as
fast
as
he
could
and
set
sail
when
he
had
sailed
a
good
way
off
he
brought
the
mill
on
deck
and
said
grind
salt
and
grind
both
good
and
fast
and
the
mill
began
to
grind
salt
so
that
it
poured
out
like
water
and
when
the
skipper
had
got
the
ship
full
he
wished
to
stop
the
mill
but
whichever
way
he
turned
it
and
however
much
he
tried
it
did
no
good
the
mill
kept
on
grinding
and
the
heap
of
salt
grew
higher
and
higher
and
at
last
down
sank
the
ship
there
lies
the
mill
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
grinds
away
to
this
very
day
and
that
is
the
reason
why
the
sea
is
salt
so
some
folks
say
the
squire
bride
there
was
once
a
very
rich
squire
who
owned
a
large
farm
had
plenty
of
silver
at
the
bottom
of
his
chest
and
money
in
the
bank
besides
but
there
was
something
he
had
not
and
that
was
a
wife
one
day
a
neighbor
daughter
was
working
for
him
in
the
hayfield
the
squire
liked
her
very
much
and
as
she
was
a
poor
man
daughter
he
thought
that
if
he
only
mentioned
marriage
she
would
be
more
than
glad
to
take
him
at
once
so
he
said
to
her
i
been
thinking
i
want
to
marry
well
one
may
think
of
many
things
said
the
lassie
as
she
stood
there
and
smiled
slyly
she
really
thought
the
old
fellow
ought
to
be
thinking
of
something
that
behooved
him
better
than
getting
married
at
his
time
of
life
now
you
see
he
said
i
was
thinking
that
you
should
be
my
wife
no
thank
you
said
she
and
much
obliged
for
the
honor
the
squire
was
not
used
to
being
gainsaid
and
the
more
she
refused
him
the
more
he
wanted
her
but
the
lassie
would
not
listen
to
him
at
all
so
the
old
man
sent
for
her
father
and
told
him
that
if
he
could
talk
his
daughter
over
and
arrange
the
whole
matter
for
him
he
would
forgive
him
the
money
he
had
lent
him
and
would
give
him
the
piece
of
land
which
lay
close
to
his
meadow
into
the
bargain
yes
yes
be
sure
i
bring
the
lass
to
her
senses
said
the
father
she
is
only
a
child
and
does
not
know
what
is
best
for
her
but
all
his
coaxing
all
his
threats
and
all
his
talking
went
for
naught
she
would
not
have
the
old
miser
if
he
sat
buried
in
gold
up
to
his
ears
she
said
the
squire
waited
and
waited
but
at
last
he
got
angry
and
told
the
father
that
he
had
to
settle
the
matter
at
once
if
he
expected
him
to
stand
by
his
bargain
for
now
he
would
wait
no
longer
the
man
knew
no
other
way
out
of
it
but
to
let
the
squire
get
everything
ready
for
the
wedding
then
when
the
parson
and
the
wedding
guests
had
arrived
the
squire
would
send
for
the
lassie
as
if
she
were
wanted
for
some
work
on
the
farm
when
she
got
there
they
would
marry
her
right
away
in
such
a
hurry
that
she
would
have
no
time
to
think
it
over
when
the
guests
had
arrived
the
squire
called
one
of
his
farm
lads
told
him
to
run
down
to
his
neighbor
and
ask
him
to
send
up
immediately
what
he
had
promised
but
if
you
are
not
back
with
her
in
a
twinkling
he
said
shaking
his
fist
at
him
i
he
did
not
finish
for
the
lad
ran
off
as
if
he
had
been
shot
at
my
master
has
sent
me
to
ask
for
that
which
you
promised
him
said
the
lad
when
he
got
to
the
neighbor
but
pray
lose
no
time
for
master
is
terribly
busy
yes
yes
run
down
in
the
meadow
and
take
her
with
you
there
she
goes
answered
the
neighbor
the
lad
ran
off
and
when
he
came
to
the
meadow
he
found
the
daughter
there
raking
the
hay
i
am
to
fetch
what
your
father
has
promised
my
master
said
the
lad
ah
ha
thought
she
is
that
what
they
are
up
to
and
with
a
wicked
twinkle
of
the
eye
she
said
oh
yes
it
that
little
bay
mare
of
ours
i
suppose
you
had
better
go
and
take
her
she
stands
tethered
on
the
other
side
of
the
pea
field
the
boy
jumped
on
the
back
of
the
bay
mare
and
rode
home
at
full
gallop
have
you
got
her
with
you
asked
the
squire
she
is
down
at
the
door
said
the
lad
take
her
up
to
the
room
my
mother
had
said
the
squire
but
master
how
can
i
said
the
lad
do
as
i
tell
you
said
the
squire
and
if
you
ca
manage
her
alone
get
the
men
to
help
you
for
he
thought
the
lassie
might
be
stubborn
when
the
lad
saw
his
master
face
he
knew
it
would
be
no
use
to
argue
so
he
went
and
got
all
the
farm
hands
together
to
help
him
some
pulled
at
the
head
and
the
forelegs
of
the
mare
and
others
pushed
from
behind
and
at
last
they
got
her
upstairs
and
into
the
room
there
lay
all
the
wedding
finery
ready
well
that
done
master
said
the
lad
while
he
wiped
his
wet
brow
but
it
was
the
worst
job
i
have
ever
had
here
on
the
farm
never
mind
never
mind
you
shall
not
have
done
it
for
nothing
said
his
master
and
he
pulled
a
bright
silver
coin
out
of
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
the
lad
now
send
the
women
up
to
dress
her
but
i
say
master
none
of
your
talk
cried
the
squire
tell
them
to
hold
her
while
they
dress
her
and
mind
not
to
forget
either
wreath
or
crown
the
lad
ran
into
the
kitchen
listen
here
lasses
he
called
out
you
are
to
go
upstairs
and
dress
up
the
bay
mare
as
a
bride
i
suppose
master
wants
to
play
a
joke
on
his
guests
the
women
laughed
and
laughed
but
ran
upstairs
and
dressed
the
bay
mare
in
everything
that
was
there
and
then
the
lad
went
and
told
his
master
that
now
she
was
all
ready
with
wreath
and
crown
and
all
very
well
bring
her
down
i
will
receive
her
at
the
door
myself
said
the
squire
there
was
a
clatter
and
a
thumping
on
the
stairs
for
that
bride
you
know
had
no
silken
slippers
on
when
the
door
was
opened
and
the
squire
bride
entered
the
room
you
can
imagine
there
was
laughing
and
tittering
and
grinning
enough
and
as
for
the
squire
they
say
he
never
went
courting
again
peik
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
and
he
had
a
wife
they
had
a
son
and
a
daughter
who
were
twins
and
these
were
so
alike
that
no
one
could
tell
one
from
the
other
except
by
their
clothing
the
boy
they
called
peik
he
was
of
little
use
while
his
father
and
mother
lived
for
he
cared
to
do
naught
else
than
to
befool
folk
and
he
was
so
full
of
tricks
and
pranks
that
no
one
was
left
in
peace
when
the
parents
died
matters
grew
still
worse
and
worse
he
would
not
turn
his
hand
to
anything
all
he
would
do
was
to
squander
what
they
left
behind
them
his
sister
toiled
and
moiled
all
she
could
but
it
helped
little
so
at
last
she
told
him
how
silly
it
was
to
do
naught
for
the
house
what
shall
we
have
to
live
on
when
you
have
wasted
everything
she
said
oh
i
go
out
and
befool
somebody
said
peik
yes
peik
i
be
bound
you
do
that
soon
enough
said
the
sister
well
i
try
said
peik
at
last
they
had
indeed
nothing
more
there
was
an
end
of
everything
and
peik
started
off
and
walked
and
walked
till
he
came
to
the
palace
now
i
must
tell
you
this
king
and
his
queen
and
eldest
daughter
were
little
better
than
trolls
mean
and
hateful
and
very
foolish
so
there
was
no
love
lost
between
them
and
the
people
when
peik
came
to
the
king
palace
there
stood
the
king
in
the
porch
and
as
soon
as
he
set
eyes
on
the
lad
he
said
whither
away
peik
oh
i
was
going
out
to
see
if
i
could
befool
anybody
said
peik
ca
you
befool
me
now
said
the
king
no
i
sure
i
ca
said
peik
for
i
forgotten
my
fooling
rods
ca
you
go
home
and
fetch
them
said
the
king
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
if
you
are
such
a
trickster
as
folks
say
i
no
strength
to
walk
said
peik
i
lend
you
a
horse
and
saddle
said
the
king
but
i
ca
ride
either
said
peik
we
lift
you
up
said
the
king
then
you
be
able
to
stick
on
well
peik
stood
and
scratched
his
head
as
though
he
would
pull
the
hair
off
and
he
let
them
lift
him
up
into
the
saddle
there
he
sat
swinging
this
side
and
that
so
long
as
the
king
could
see
him
and
the
king
laughed
till
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
for
such
a
tailor
on
horseback
he
had
never
seen
but
when
peik
was
come
well
into
the
wood
behind
the
hill
so
that
he
was
out
of
the
king
sight
he
sat
as
though
he
were
tied
to
the
horse
and
off
he
rode
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
carry
him
but
when
he
got
to
the
town
he
sold
both
horse
and
saddle
all
the
while
the
king
walked
up
and
down
and
loitered
and
waited
for
peik
to
come
tottering
back
again
with
his
fooling
rods
and
every
now
and
then
he
laughed
when
he
called
to
mind
how
wretched
the
lad
looked
as
he
sat
swinging
about
on
the
horse
like
a
sack
of
corn
not
knowing
on
which
side
to
fall
off
this
lasted
for
seven
lengths
and
seven
breaths
but
no
peik
came
and
so
at
last
the
king
saw
that
he
was
fooled
and
cheated
out
of
his
horse
and
saddle
even
though
peik
had
not
had
his
fooling
rods
with
him
then
there
was
another
story
for
the
king
got
wroth
and
was
all
for
setting
off
to
kill
peik
but
peik
had
found
out
the
day
he
was
coming
and
told
his
sister
she
must
put
on
the
big
with
a
little
water
in
it
just
as
the
king
came
in
peik
dragged
the
pot
off
the
fire
and
ran
off
with
it
to
the
and
so
boiled
the
porridge
on
the
block
the
king
wondered
at
that
and
wondered
on
and
on
so
much
that
he
quite
forgot
what
brought
him
there
what
do
you
want
for
that
pot
said
he
i
ca
spare
it
said
peik
why
not
said
the
king
i
pay
what
you
ask
no
no
said
peik
it
saves
me
time
and
money
wood
hire
and
chopping
hire
carting
and
carrying
never
mind
said
the
king
i
give
you
a
hundred
dollars
it
true
you
fooled
me
out
of
a
horse
and
saddle
and
bridle
besides
but
all
that
shall
go
for
nothing
if
i
can
only
get
the
pot
well
if
you
must
have
it
you
must
said
peik
when
the
king
got
home
he
asked
guests
and
made
a
feast
but
the
meat
was
to
be
boiled
in
the
new
pot
and
so
he
took
it
up
and
set
it
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
guests
thought
the
king
had
lost
his
wits
and
went
about
elbowing
one
another
and
laughing
at
him
but
he
walked
round
and
round
the
pot
and
cackled
and
chattered
saying
all
in
a
breath
well
well
bide
a
bit
bide
a
bit
boil
in
a
minute
but
there
was
no
boiling
so
he
saw
that
peik
had
been
out
with
his
fooling
rods
and
had
cheated
him
again
and
now
he
would
set
off
at
once
and
slay
him
when
the
king
came
peik
stood
out
by
the
barn
door
would
it
boil
he
asked
no
it
would
not
and
you
shall
smart
for
it
said
the
king
about
to
unsheath
his
knife
i
can
well
believe
that
said
peik
for
you
did
not
take
the
block
too
i
wish
i
thought
said
the
king
you
were
telling
me
a
pack
of
lies
i
tell
you
it
because
of
the
block
it
stands
on
it
wo
boil
without
it
said
peik
well
what
do
you
want
for
it
it
was
well
worth
three
hundred
dollars
but
for
the
king
sake
it
should
go
for
two
so
the
king
got
the
block
and
traveled
home
with
it
he
bade
guests
again
made
a
feast
and
set
the
pot
on
the
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
guests
thought
he
was
both
daft
and
mad
and
they
went
about
making
game
of
him
while
he
cackled
and
chattered
around
the
pot
calling
out
bide
a
bit
now
it
boils
now
it
boils
in
a
trice
but
it
would
boil
a
bit
more
on
the
block
than
on
the
bare
floor
so
he
saw
that
peik
had
been
out
with
his
fooling
rods
this
time
too
then
he
fell
his
hair
and
said
he
would
set
off
at
once
and
slay
the
lad
he
would
spare
him
this
time
whether
or
no
but
peik
was
ready
for
him
he
had
filled
a
leather
bag
with
blood
and
stuffed
it
into
his
sister
bosom
and
told
her
what
to
say
and
do
where
peik
screamed
out
the
king
he
was
in
such
a
rage
that
he
stuttered
and
stammered
he
is
so
poorly
that
he
ca
stir
hand
or
foot
she
said
and
now
he
trying
to
get
a
nap
wake
him
up
said
the
king
nay
i
dare
he
will
be
so
angry
said
the
sister
well
i
am
angrier
still
said
the
king
and
if
you
do
wake
him
i
will
and
with
that
he
tapped
his
side
where
his
knife
hung
well
she
would
go
and
wake
him
but
peik
turned
hastily
in
his
bed
drew
out
a
knife
and
ripped
open
the
leather
bag
in
her
bosom
so
that
the
blood
gushed
out
and
down
she
fell
on
the
floor
as
though
she
were
dead
what
an
awful
fellow
you
are
peik
said
the
king
you
have
killed
your
sister
right
before
my
eyes
oh
there
no
trouble
with
her
so
long
as
there
breath
in
my
nostrils
said
peik
and
with
that
he
pulled
out
a
ram
horn
and
began
to
toot
on
it
he
blew
with
one
end
of
the
horn
to
her
body
and
up
she
rose
as
though
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
her
dear
me
peik
can
you
kill
folk
and
blow
life
into
them
again
can
you
do
that
said
the
king
why
said
peik
how
could
i
get
on
at
all
if
i
could
i
am
always
killing
every
one
i
come
near
do
you
know
i
have
a
terrible
temper
i
am
too
said
the
king
and
that
horn
i
must
have
i
give
you
a
hundred
dollars
for
it
and
besides
i
forgive
you
for
cheating
me
out
of
my
horse
and
for
fooling
me
about
the
pot
and
the
block
and
all
else
peik
was
loth
to
part
with
it
but
for
his
sake
he
would
let
him
have
it
and
so
the
king
went
off
home
with
it
and
he
hardly
got
back
before
he
must
try
it
so
he
fell
and
quarreling
with
the
queen
and
his
eldest
daughter
and
they
paid
him
back
in
the
same
coin
but
before
they
knew
what
was
happening
he
had
whipped
out
his
knife
and
cut
their
throats
they
fell
down
stone
dead
and
the
other
two
daughters
ran
from
the
house
they
were
so
afraid
the
king
walked
about
the
floor
for
a
while
and
kept
chattering
that
there
was
no
harm
done
so
long
as
there
was
breath
in
him
and
then
he
pulled
out
the
horn
and
began
to
blow
but
though
he
blew
and
tooted
as
hard
as
he
could
all
that
day
and
the
next
too
he
could
not
blow
life
into
them
again
dead
they
were
and
dead
they
stayed
but
the
people
in
the
kingdom
were
only
glad
to
get
rid
of
such
and
were
wishing
some
one
might
make
an
end
of
the
king
too
so
that
they
might
have
a
good
king
in
his
place
but
the
king
was
now
angrier
than
ever
and
must
go
right
off
to
kill
peik
but
peik
knew
that
he
was
coming
and
then
he
said
to
his
sister
now
you
must
change
clothes
with
me
and
set
off
if
you
will
do
that
you
may
have
all
we
own
so
she
changed
clothes
with
him
packed
up
and
started
off
as
fast
as
she
could
but
peik
sat
all
alone
in
his
sister
clothes
where
is
that
peik
roared
the
king
as
as
he
came
in
a
towering
rage
through
the
door
he
has
run
away
said
peik
he
knew
that
your
majesty
was
coming
so
he
left
me
all
alone
without
a
morsel
of
bread
or
a
penny
in
my
purse
and
he
made
himself
as
gentle
and
sweet
as
a
young
lady
come
along
then
to
the
king
palace
and
you
shall
have
enough
to
live
on
there
no
good
sitting
here
and
starving
in
this
cabin
by
yourself
said
the
king
so
peik
went
home
with
the
king
and
there
he
was
treated
as
the
own
daughter
for
miss
peik
sewed
and
stitched
and
sang
and
played
with
the
others
and
was
with
them
early
and
late
but
one
day
a
man
came
to
the
king
and
told
him
that
peik
sister
was
at
a
farm
in
the
neighborhood
and
that
it
was
peik
he
had
brought
up
in
his
own
house
now
peik
had
heard
all
that
the
man
told
the
king
so
he
ran
away
from
the
king
palace
out
into
the
wide
world
the
king
got
into
a
terrible
rage
then
and
called
for
peik
but
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
then
he
mounted
his
horse
to
go
out
to
look
for
peik
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
came
to
a
ploughed
field
and
there
sat
peik
on
a
stone
playing
on
a
mouth
organ
what
are
you
sitting
there
peik
said
the
king
here
i
sit
sure
enough
said
peik
where
else
should
i
sit
you
have
cheated
me
foully
time
after
time
said
the
king
but
now
you
must
come
along
home
with
me
and
i
kill
you
well
well
said
peik
if
it
ca
be
helped
it
ca
i
suppose
i
must
go
along
with
you
when
they
got
home
to
the
king
palace
they
got
ready
a
barrel
which
peik
was
to
be
put
in
and
when
it
was
ready
they
carted
it
up
a
high
mountain
there
he
was
to
lie
three
days
thinking
on
all
the
evil
he
had
done
then
they
were
to
roll
him
down
the
mountain
into
the
sea
the
third
day
a
rich
man
passed
by
and
when
he
heard
peik
story
he
was
ready
to
help
him
out
of
his
trouble
they
made
a
stuffed
man
and
put
him
with
some
stones
into
the
barrel
but
the
rich
man
gave
peik
horses
and
cows
sheep
and
swine
and
money
beside
now
the
king
came
to
roll
peik
down
the
mountain
a
happy
journey
said
the
king
and
now
it
is
all
over
with
you
and
your
fooling
rods
before
the
barrel
was
halfway
down
the
mountain
there
was
not
a
whole
stave
of
it
left
nor
would
there
have
been
a
whole
limb
on
peik
had
he
been
there
but
when
the
king
came
back
to
the
palace
peik
was
there
before
him
and
sat
in
the
playing
on
his
mouth
organ
what
you
sitting
here
you
peik
yes
here
i
sit
sure
enough
where
else
should
i
sit
said
peik
maybe
i
can
get
room
here
for
all
my
horses
and
sheep
and
money
but
whither
was
it
that
i
rolled
you
that
you
got
all
this
wealth
asked
the
king
oh
you
rolled
me
into
the
sea
said
peik
and
when
i
got
to
the
bottom
there
was
more
than
enough
and
to
spare
both
of
horses
and
sheep
and
of
gold
and
silver
the
cattle
went
about
in
great
flocks
and
the
gold
and
silver
lay
in
large
heaps
as
big
as
houses
what
will
you
take
to
roll
me
down
the
same
way
asked
the
king
oh
said
peik
it
costs
little
or
nothing
to
do
it
besides
you
took
nothing
from
me
and
so
i
take
nothing
from
you
either
so
he
stuffed
the
king
into
a
barrel
and
rolled
him
over
and
when
he
had
given
him
a
ride
down
to
the
sea
for
nothing
he
went
home
to
the
king
palace
illustration
so
he
stuffed
the
king
into
the
barrel
and
rolled
him
over
then
he
began
to
hold
his
bridal
feast
with
the
youngest
princess
and
afterwards
he
ruled
the
land
both
well
and
long
but
he
kept
his
fooling
rods
to
himself
and
kept
them
so
well
that
nothing
was
ever
heard
of
peik
and
his
tricks
but
only
of
ourself
the
king
the
princess
who
could
not
be
silenced
there
was
once
a
king
and
he
had
a
daughter
who
was
so
cross
and
crooked
in
her
words
that
no
one
could
silence
her
and
so
he
gave
it
out
that
he
who
could
do
it
should
marry
the
princess
and
have
half
the
kingdom
too
there
were
plenty
of
those
who
wanted
to
try
it
i
can
tell
you
for
it
is
not
every
day
that
you
can
get
a
princess
and
half
a
kingdom
the
gate
to
the
king
palace
did
not
stand
still
a
minute
they
came
in
great
crowds
from
the
east
and
the
west
both
riding
and
walking
but
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
could
silence
the
princess
at
last
the
king
had
it
given
out
that
those
who
tried
and
failed
should
have
both
ears
marked
with
the
big
redhot
iron
with
which
he
marked
his
sheep
he
was
not
going
to
have
all
that
flurry
and
worry
for
nothing
well
there
were
three
brothers
who
had
heard
about
the
princess
and
as
they
did
not
fare
very
well
at
home
they
thought
they
had
better
set
out
to
try
their
luck
and
see
if
they
could
not
win
the
princess
and
half
the
kingdom
they
were
friends
and
good
fellows
all
three
of
them
and
they
set
off
together
when
they
had

the
way

they
oh

said
boots
and
now
as
they
walked
over
the
fields
close
up
to
the
king
palace
boots
bent
down
again
and
held
something
in
his
fingers
oh
lads

i
found
he
cried
if
you
only
found
a
little
common
sense
it
would
be
good
for

said
they
well

he

said
the
brothers
oh

carry
that
if
i
am
to
win
the
princess
and
half
the
kingdom
said
boots
yes
you
are
likely
to
do
that
you
said
they
and
now
they
came
to
the
king
palace
the
eldest
one
went
in
first
said
he
to
you
said
the
princess
and
she
twisted
and
turned
it
awfully
hot
here
said
he
it
is
hotter
over
there
in
the
hearth
said
the
princess
there
lay
the
iron
ready
awaiting
when
he
saw
that
he
forgot
every
word
he
was
going
to
say
and
so
it
was
all
over
with
him
and
now
came
the
next
oldest
one
said
he
to
you
said
she
and
she
turned
and
twisted
herself
it
awfully
hot
here
said
he
it
hotter
over
there
in
the
hearth
said
she
and
when
he
looked
at
the
iron
he
too
could
get
a
word
out
and
so
they
marked
his
ears
and
sent
him
home
again
then
it
was
boots
turn
said
he
to
you
said
she
and
she
twisted
and
turned
again
it
nice
and
warm
in
here
said
boots
it
hotter
in
the
hearth
said
she
and
she
was
no
sweeter
now
the
third
one
had
come
that
good
i
may
bake
my
crow
there
then
asked
he
i
afraid
she
burst
said
the
princess
there
no
danger
i
wind
this
willow
twig
around
said
the
lad
it
too
loose
said
she
i
stick
this
wedge
in
said
the
lad
and
took
out
the
wedge
the
fat
will
drop
off
said
the
princess
i
hold
this
under
said
the
lad
and
pulled
out
the
broken
bit
of
the
saucer
you
are
crooked
in
your
words
that
you
are
said
the
princess
no
i
not
crooked
but
this
is
crooked
said
the
lad
and
he
showed
her
the
goat
horn
well
i
never
saw
the
equal
to
that
cried
the
princess
oh
here
is
the
equal
to
it
said
he
and
pulled
out
the
other
now
you
think
you
wear
out
my
soul
do
you
said
she
no
i
wo
wear
out
your
soul
for
i
have
a
sole
that
worn
out
already
said
the
lad
and
pulled
out
the
shoe
sole
then
the
princess
had
a
word
to
say
now
you
mine
said
boots
and
so
she
was
the
twelve
wild
ducks
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
queen
who
had
twelve
sons
but
no
daughter
one
day
she
was
out
driving
in
the
woods
and
met
the
prettiest
little
lassie
one
ever
did
see
and
so
the
queen
stopped
her
horses
lifted
the
child
up
in
her
arms
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
all
the
while
thinking
i
wish
i
had
a
little
girl
of
my
own
oh
how
long
i
waited
and
wished
for
one
just
then
an
old
witch
of
the
trolls
came
up
to
her
but
you
have
known
it
was
a
witch
at
all
she
looked
so
kind
and
good
a
daughter
you
shall
have
she
said
and
she
shall
be
the
prettiest
child
in
twelve
kingdoms
if
you
will
give
to
me
what
ever
comes
to
meet
you
at
the
bridge
now
the
queen
had
a
little
snow
white
dog
of
which
she
was
very
fond
and
it
always
ran
to
meet
her
when
she
had
been
away
she
thought
of
course
it
was
the
dog
the
old
dame
wanted
so
the
queen
said
yes
you
may
have
what
comes
to
meet
me
on
the
bridge
with
that
she
hurried
home
as
fast
as
she
could
but
who
should
come
to
meet
her
on
the
bridge
but
her
twelve
sons
and
before
the
mother
could
cry
out
to
them
the
wicked
witch
threw
her
spell
upon
them
and
turned
them
into
twelve
ducks
which
flapped
their
wings
and
flew
away
away
they
went
and
away
they
stayed
but
the
queen
had
a
daughter
and
she
was
the
loveliest
child
one
ever
set
eyes
upon
the
princess
grew
up
and
she
was
both
tall
and
fair
but
she
was
often
quiet
and
sorrowful
and
no
one
could
understand
what
it
was
that
ailed
her
the
queen
too
was
often
sorrowful
as
you
may
believe
for
she
had
many
strange
fears
when
she
thought
of
her
sons
and
one
day
she
said
to
her
daughter
why
are
you
so
sorrowful
lassie
mine
is
there
anything
you
want
if
so
only
say
the
word
and
you
shall
have
it
oh
it
seems
so
dull
and
lonely
here
said
the
daughter
every
one
else
has
brothers
and
sisters
but
i
am
all
alone
i
have
none
why
i
so
sorrowful
but
you
had
brothers
my
daughter
said
the
queen
i
had
twelve
sons
stout
brave
lads
but
i
lost
them
all
when
you
came
and
so
she
told
her
the
whole
story
when
the
princess
heard
that
she
had
no
rest
for
she
thought
it
was
all
her
fault
and
in
spite
of
all
the
queen
could
say
or
do
though
she
wept
and
prayed
the
lassie
would
set
off
to
seek
her
brothers
on
and
on
she
walked
into
the
wide
world
so
far
you
would
never
have
thought
her
small
feet
could
have
had
strength
to
carry
her
so
far
finally
one
day
when
she
was
walking
through
a
great
great
wood
she
felt
tired
and
sat
down
on
a
mossy
tuft
and
fell
asleep
then
she
dreamt
that
she
went
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wood
till
she
came
to
a
little
wooden
hut
and
there
she
found
her
brothers
just
then
she
awoke
and
straight
before
her
she
saw
a
worn
path
in
the
green
moss
this
path
went
deeper
into
the
wood
so
she
followed
it
and
after
a
long
time
she
came
to
just
such
a
little
wooden
house
as
that
she
had
seen
in
her
dream
now
when
she
went
into
the
room
there
was
no
one
at
home
but
there
were
twelve
beds
and
twelve
chairs
and
twelve
spoons
in
short
a
dozen
of
everything
when
she
saw
that
she
was
very
glad
she
had
not
been
so
glad
for
many
a
long
year
for
she
could
guess
at
once
that
her
brothers
lived
there
and
that
they
owned
the
beds
and
chairs
and
spoons
so
she
began
to
make
up
the
fire
and
sweep
the
room
and
make
the
beds
and
cook
the
dinner
and
to
make
the
house
as
tidy
as
she
could
and
when
she
had
done
all
the
work
and
the
dinner
was
on
the
table
she
suddenly
heard
something
flapping
and
whirling
in
the
air
and
she
slipped
behind
the
door
then
all
the
twelve
ducks
came
sweeping
in
but
as
soon
as
ever
they
crossed
the
threshold
they
became
princes
oh
how
nice
and
warm
it
is
here
they
said
heaven
bless
him
who
made
up
the
fire
and
cooked
such
a
nice
dinner
for
us
but
who
can
it
be
said
the
youngest
prince
and
they
all
hunted
both
high
and
low
until
they
found
the
lassie
behind
the
door
and
she
threw
her
arms
around
their
necks
and
said
i
your
sister
i
gone
about
seeking
you
these
three
years
and
if
i
could
set
you
free
willingly
give
my
life
then
all
the
brothers
looked
sorrowfully
one
at
the
other
and
they
shook
their
heads
no
it
too
hard
said
the
eldest
prince
looking
at
the
pretty
young
princess
it
too
hard
and
again
they
sighed
and
shook
their
heads
oh
tell
me
only
tell
me
said
the
princess
how
can
it
be
done
and
i
do
it
whatever
it
be
and
as
she
begged
and
pleaded
for
them
to
tell
her
the
youngest
brother
said
at
last
you
must
pick
thistledown
and
you
must
card
it
and
spin
it
and
weave
it
after
you
have
done
that
you
must
cut
out
and
make
twelve
shirts
one
for
each
of
us
and
while
you
do
that
you
must
neither
talk
nor
laugh
nor
weep
if
you
can
do
that
we
are
free
but
where
shall
i
ever
get
thistledown
enough
for
so
many
shirts
asked
the
sister
well
that
is
the
hardest
thing
of
all
said
the
eldest
brother
you
must
go
to
the
witches
moor
at
midnight
and
gather
it
there
and
big
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
and
you
must
go
alone
all
alone
but
the
sister
smiled
and
nodded
her
head
and
when
midnight
came
and
the
moon
was
high
in
the
sky
she
said
to
her
brothers
and
went
to
the
great
wide
moor
where
the
witches
lived
there
stood
a
great
crop
of
thistles
all
nodding
and
nodding
in
the
breeze
while
the
down
floated
and
glistened
like
gossamer
through
the
air
in
the
moonbeams
the
princess
began
to
pluck
and
gather
it
as
fast
as
she
could
but
she
saw
long
skinny
arms
outstretched
toward
her
and
among
the
thistles
she
saw
a
host
of
wicked
faces
all
looking
at
her
her
heart
stood
still
then
and
she
grew
icy
cold
but
never
a
sound
did
she
utter
only
plucked
and
gathered
until
her
bag
was
full
and
when
she
got
home
at
break
of
day
she
set
to
work
carding
and
spinning
yarn
from
the
down
illustration
the
princess
began
to
pluck
and
gather
as
fast
as
she
could
so
she
went
on
a
long
long
time
picking
down
on
the
witches
moor
carding
and
spinning
and
all
the
while
keeping
the
house
of
the
princes
cooking
and
making
their
beds
but
she
never
talked
nor
laughed
nor
wept
at
evening
home
the
brothers
came
flapping
and
whirring
like
wild
ducks
and
all
night
they
were
princes
but
in
the
morning
off
they
flew
again
and
were
wild
ducks
the
whole
day
but
it
happened
one
night
when
she
was
out
on
the
moor
picking
thistledown
that
the
young
king
who
ruled
that
land
was
out
hunting
and
had
lost
his
way
he
had
become
separated
from
his
companions
and
now
as
he
came
riding
across
the
moor
he
saw
her
he
stopped
and
wondered
who
the
lovely
lady
could
be
that
walked
alone
on
the
moor
picking
thistledown
in
the
dead
of
the
night
and
he
asked
her
name
getting
no
answer
he
was
still
more
astonished
but
he
liked
her
so
much
that
at
last
nothing
would
do
but
he
must
take
her
home
to
his
castle
and
marry
her
so
he
took
her
and
put
her
upon
his
horse
the
princess
wrung
her
hands
and
made
signs
to
him
and
pointed
to
the
bags
in
which
her
work
was
and
when
the
king
saw
she
wished
to
have
them
with
her
he
took
the
bags
and
placed
them
behind
them
when
that
was
done
the
princess
little
by
little
came
to
herself
for
the
king
was
both
a
wise
man
and
a
handsome
man
and
he
was
as
gentle
and
kind
to
her
as
a
mother
but
when
they
reached
the
palace
an
old
woman
met
them
she
was
the
king
guardian
and
when
she
set
eyes
on
the
princess
she
became
so
cross
and
jealous
of
her
because
she
was
so
lovely
that
she
said
to
the
king
ca
you
see
now
that
this
thing
whom
you
have
picked
up
and
whom
you
are
going
to
marry
is
a
witch
why
she
can
neither
talk
nor
laugh
nor
weep
but
the
king
did
not
care
a
straw
for
what
she
said
he
held
to
the
wedding
and
married
the
princess
and
they
lived
in
great
joy
and
glory
but
the
princess
did
forget
to
go
on
working
on
her
shirts
and
she
neither
talked
nor
laughed
nor
wept
however
when
she
had
spun
and
woven
and
cut
she
found
that
she
still
had
not
enough
cloth
for
the
twelve
shirts
and
she
needs
must
go
to
the
witches
moor
again
so
that
night
while
all
the
palace
slept
she
quietly
slipped
out
and
walked
off
to
pick
her
thistledown
but
the
old
woman
who
was
the
guardian
saw
her
and
she
knew
well
where
the
young
queen
was
going
for
i
must
tell
you
she
was
the
same
wicked
witch
who
had
changed
the
twelve
princes
into
wild
ducks
she
hurried
to
the
king
chamber
woke
him
and
said
now
come
with
me
and
i
prove
to
you
that
your
lovely
queen
is
a
witch
who
joins
the
wicked
company
on
the
moor
at
midnight
the
king
would
not
listen
to
her
at
first
but
when
he
saw
that
the
queen
bed
was
empty
he
got
up
and
went
with
the
old
woman
and
there
upon
the
edge
of
the
moor
they
stopped
but
in
the
clear
moonlight
they
could
see
the
queen
among
the
horrid
hags
and
trolls
the
king
turned
away
sadly
and
said
not
a
word
for
he
loved
his
quiet
queen
very
much
but
the
wicked
old
woman
began
to
whisper
and
tell
abroad
about
the
queen
nightly
visit
to
the
moor
and
at
last
the
king
best
men
came
to
him
and
said
we
will
not
have
a
queen
who
is
a
witch
the
people
demand
of
you
that
she
be
burnt
alive
then
the
king
was
so
sad
that
there
was
no
end
to
his
sadness
for
now
he
saw
that
he
could
not
save
her
he
was
obliged
to
order
her
to
be
burnt
alive
on
a
pile
of
wood
when
the
pile
was
all
ablaze
and
they
were
about
to
put
her
on
it
she
made
signs
to
them
to
take
twelve
boards
and
lay
them
around
the
pile
on
these
she
laid
the
shirts
for
her
brothers
all
completed
but
that
for
the
youngest
which
lacked
its
left
sleeve
she
had
not
had
time
to
finish
it
and
as
soon
as
ever
she
had
done
that
they
heard
a
flapping
and
whirring
in
the
air
and
down
came
twelve
wild
ducks
from
over
the
forest
and
each
snapped
up
his
shirt
in
his
bill
and
flew
off
with
it
see
now
said
the
old
woman
to
the
king
was
i
right
when
i
told
you
she
was
a
witch
make
haste
and
burn
her
before
the
pile
burns
low
oh
said
the
king
we
wood
enough
and
to
spare
and
so
i
wait
a
bit
for
i
have
a
mind
to
see
what
the
end
of
this
will
be
as
he
spoke
up
came
the
twelve
princes
riding
along
as
handsome
lads
as
you
wish
to
see
but
the
youngest
prince
had
a
wild
duck
wing
instead
of
his
left
arm
what
all
this
about
asked
the
princes
my
queen
is
to
be
burnt
said
the
king
because
she
is
a
witch
so
the
people
say
and
i
ca
save
her
speak
now
sister
said
the
princes
you
have
set
us
free
and
saved
us
now
save
yourself
then
the
young
queen
spoke
and
told
the
whole
story
and
the
king
and
all
the
people
listened
with
wonder
and
joy
only
the
wicked
old
woman
stood
trembling
with
fear
and
when
the
queen
had
finished
her
story
the
people
took
the
old
witch
and
bound
her
and
burned
her
on
the
pile
but
the
king
took
his
wife
and
the
twelve
princes
and
went
home
with
them
to
their
father
and
mother
and
told
all
that
had
befallen
them
then
there
was
joy
and
gladness
over
the
whole
kingdom
because
the
wicked
witch
was
dead
and
the
princes
saved
and
set
free
and
because
the
lovely
princess
had
set
free
her
twelve
brothers
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
man
whose
name
was
gudbrand
he
had
a
farm
which
lay
far
far
away
upon
a
hillside
and
so
they
called
him
now
you
must
know
this
man
and
his
good
wife
lived
so
happily
together
and
understood
one
another
so
well
that
all
the
husband
did
the
wife
thought
so
well
done
there
was
nothing
like
it
in
the
world
and
she
was
always
pleased
at
whatever
he
turned
his
hand
to
the
farm
was
their
own
land
and
they
had
a
hundred
dollars
lying
at
the
bottom
of
their
chest
and
two
cows
tethered
up
in
a
stall
in
their
farmyard
so
one
day
his
wife
said
to
gudbrand
do
you
know
dear
i
think
we
ought
to
take
one
of
our
cows
into
town
and
sell
it
that
what
i
think
for
then
we
shall
have
some
money
in
hand
and
such
people
as
we
ought
to
have
ready
money
as
other
folks
have
as
for
the
hundred
dollars
in
the
chest
yonder
we
ca
make
a
hole
in
our
savings
and
i
sure
i
do
know
what
we
want
with
more
than
one
cow
besides
we
shall
gain
a
little
in
another
way
for
then
i
shall
get
off
with
only
looking
after
one
cow
instead
of
having
as
now
to
feed
and
litter
and
water
two
well
gudbrand
thought
his
wife
talked
right
good
sense
so
he
set
off
at
once
with
the
cow
on
the
way
to
town
to
sell
her
but
when
he
got
to
the
town
there
was
no
one
who
would
buy
his
cow
well
well
never
mind
said
gudbrand
at
the
worst
i
can
only
go
back
home
with
my
cow
i
both
stable
and
tether
for
her
and
the
road
is
no
farther
out
than
in
and
with
that
he
began
to
toddle
home
with
his
cow
but
when
he
had
gone
a
bit
of
the
way
a
man
met
him
who
had
a
horse
to
sell
gudbrand
thought
was
better
to
have
a
horse
than
a
cow
so
he
traded
with
the
man
a
little
farther
on
he
met
a
man
walking
along
and
driving
a
fat
pig
before
him
and
he
thought
it
better
to
have
a
fat
pig
than
a
horse
so
he
traded
with
the
man
after
that
he
went
a
little
farther
and
a
man
met
him
with
a
goat
so
he
thought
it
better
to
have
a
goat
than
a
pig
and
he
traded
with
the
man
who
owned
the
goat
then
he
went
on
a
good
bit
till
he
met
a
man
who
had
a
sheep
and
he
traded
with
him
too
for
he
thought
it
always
better
to
have
a
sheep
than
a
goat
after
a
while
he
met
a
man
with
a
goose
and
he
traded
away
the
sheep
for
the
goose
and
when
he
had
walked
a
long
long
time
he
met
a
man
with
a
cock
and
he
traded
with
him
for
he
thought
in
this
wise
tis
surely
better
to
have
a
cock
than
a
goose
then
he
went
on
till
the
day
was
far
spent
and
he
began
to
get
very
hungry
so
he
sold
the
cock
for
a
shilling
and
bought
food
with
the
money
for
thought
tis
always
better
to
save
one
life
than
to
have
a
cock
after
that
he
went
on
homeward
till
he
reached
his
nearest
house
where
he
turned
in
well
said
the
owner
of
the
house
how
did
things
go
with
you
in
town
rather
said
gudbrand
i
ca
praise
my
luck
nor
do
i
blame
it
either
and
with
that
he
told
the
whole
story
from
first
to
last
ah
said
his
friend
you
get
nicely
hauled
over
the
coals
when
you
go
home
to
your
wife
heaven
help
you
i
would
stand
in
your
shoes
for
anything
well
said
i
think
things
might
have
gone
much
worse
with
me
but
now
whether
i
have
done
wrong
or
not
i
have
so
kind
a
good
wife
she
never
has
a
word
to
say
against
anything
that
i
do
oh
answered
his
neighbor
i
hear
what
you
say
but
i
do
believe
it
for
all
that
and
so
you
doubt
it
asked
yes
said
the
friend
i
have
a
hundred
crowns
at
the
bottom
of
my
chest
at
home
i
will
give
you
if
you
can
prove
what
you
say
so
gudbrand
stayed
there
till
evening
when
it
began
to
get
dark
and
then
they
went
together
to
his
house
and
the
neighbor
was
to
stand
outside
the
door
and
listen
while
the
man
went
in
to
his
wife
good
evening
said
hillside
good
evening
said
the
good
wife
oh
is
that
you
now
i
am
happy
then
the
wife
asked
how
things
had
gone
with
him
in
town
oh
only
answered
gudbrand
not
much
to
brag
of
when
i
got
to
town
there
was
no
one
who
would
buy
the
cow
so
you
must
know
i
traded
it
away
for
a
horse
for
a
horse
said
his
wife
well
that
is
good
of
you
thanks
with
all
my
heart
we
are
so
well
to
do
that
we
may
drive
to
church
just
as
well
as
other
people
and
if
we
choose
to
keep
a
horse
we
have
a
right
to
get
one
i
should
think

farther
i
traded

for
a

all
my
heart
cried
his
wife
what

i

have
no
spinning
wheel
or
carding
comb
nor
should
i
care
to

and
sewing
clothes
we

as
we

and
now
i

besides

my
little

run
out
child
and
put
up
the
goose
well
said
gudbrand
i

the
goose
either
for
when
i
had
gone
a
bit
farther
i
traded
it
for
a
cock
dear
me
cried
his
wife
how
you
think
of
everything
just
as
i
should
have
done
myself
a
cock
think
of
that
why
it
as
good
as
an
eight
day
clock
for
every
day
the
cock
crows
at
four
and
we
shall
be
able
to
stir
our
stiff
legs
in
good
time
what
should
we
do
with
a
goose
i
do
know
how
to
cook
it
and
as
for
my
pillow
i
can
stuff
it
with
cotton
grass
run
out
child
and
put
up
the
cock
but
after
all
i
have
the
cock
either
said
gudbrand
for
when
i
had
gone
a
bit
farther
i
became
as
hungry
as
a
hunter
so
i
was
forced
to
sell
the
cock
for
a
shilling
for
fear
i
should
starve
now
god
be
praised
that
you
did
so
cried
his
wife
whatever
you
do
you
do
it
always
just
after
my
own
heart
what
should
we
do
with
the
cock
we
are
our
own
masters
i
should
think
and
can
lie
abed
in
the
morning
as
long
as
we
like
heaven
be
thanked
that
i
have
you
safe
back
again
you
who
do
everything
so
well
that
i
want
neither
cock
nor
goose
neither
pigs
nor
kine
then
gudbrand
opened
the
door
and
said
well
what
do
you
say
now
have
i
won
the
hundred
crowns
and
his
neighbor
was
forced
to
admit
that
he
had
the
princess
on
the
glass
hill
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
who
had
a
meadow
which
lay
high
upon
the
hillside
and
in
the
meadow
was
a
barn
which
he
had
built
to
keep
his
hay
in
now
i
must
tell
you
there
had
been
much
in
the
barn
for
the
last
year
or
two
for
every
john
night
when
the
grass
stood
greenest
and
deepest
the
meadow
was
eaten
down
to
the
very
ground
the
next
morning
just
as
if
a
whole
drove
of
sheep
had
been
there
feeding
on
it
over
night
this
happened
once
and
it
happened
twice
so
at
last
the
man
grew
weary
of
losing
his
crop
of
hay
and
said
to
his
sons
for
he
had
three
of
them
and
the
youngest
was
nicknamed
boots
of
course
that
now
one
of
them
must
just
go
and
sleep
in
the
barn
in
the
outlying
field
when
john
night
came
for
it
was
no
joke
that
his
grass
should
be
eaten
root
and
blade
this
year
as
it
had
been
the
last
two
years
so
whichever
of
them
went
must
keep
a
sharp
that
was
what
their
father
said
well
the
eldest
son
was
ready
to
go
and
watch
the
meadow
trust
him
for
looking
after
the
grass
so
when
evening
came
he
set
off
to
the
barn
and
lay
down
to
sleep
but
a
little
on
in
the
night
came
such
a
clatter
and
such
an
earthquake
that
walls
and
roof
shook
and
groaned
and
creaked
then
up
jumped
the
lad
and
took
to
his
heels
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
nor
dared
he
once
look
around
until
he
reached
home
and
as
for
the
hay
why
it
was
eaten
up
this
year
just
as
it
had
been
twice
before
the
next
john
night
the
man
said
again
it
would
never
do
to
lose
all
the
grass
in
the
outlying
field
year
after
year
in
this
way
so
one
of
his
sons
must
just
trudge
off
to
watch
it
and
watch
it
well
too
well
the
next
oldest
son
was
ready
to
try
his
luck
so
he
set
off
and
sat
down
to
watch
in
the
barn
as
his
brother
had
done
before
him
but
as
the
night
wore
on
there
came
on
a
rumbling
and
quaking
of
the
earth
worse
even
than
on
the
last
john
night
and
when
the
lad
heard
it
he
got
frightened
and
took
to
his
heels
as
though
he
were
running
a
race
next
year
the
turn
came
to
boots
but
when
he
made
ready
to
go
the
other
two
began
to
laugh
and
to
make
game
of
him
saying
you
just
the
man
to
watch
the
hay
that
you
are
you
who
have
done
nothing
all
your
life
but
sit
in
the
ashes
and
toast
yourself
by
the
fire
but
boots
did
not
care
a
pin
for
their
chattering
and
as
evening
drew
on
he
walked
up
the
hillside
to
the
outlying
field
there
he
went
inside
the
barn
and
sat
down
but
in
about
an
hour
time
the
barn
began
to
groan
and
creak
so
that
it
was
dreadful
to
hear
well
said
boots
to
himself
if
it
is
worse
than
this
i
can
stand
it
well
enough
a
little
while
after
came
another
creak
and
an
earthquake
so
that
the
litter
in
the
barn
flew
about
the
lad
ears
oh
said
boots
to
himself
if
it
is
worse
than
this
i
daresay
i
can
stand
it
out
but
just
then
came
a
third
rumbling
and
a
third
earthquake
so
that
the
lad
thought
walls
and
roof
were
coming
down
on
his
head
but
it
passed
off
and
all
was
still
as
death
about
him
it
come
again
i
be
bound
thought
boots
but
no
it
did
come
again
still
it
was
and
still
it
stayed
but
after
he
had
sat
a
little
while
he
heard
a
noise
as
if
a
horse
were
standing
just
outside
the
barn
door
and
feeding
on
the
grass
he
stole
to
the
door
and
peeped
through
a
chink
and
there
stood
a
horse
feeding
away
so
big
and
fat
and
grand
a
horse
boots
had
never
set
eyes
on
by
his
side
on
the
grass
lay
a
saddle
and
bridle
and
a
full
set
of
armor
for
a
knight
all
of
brass
so
bright
that
the
light
gleamed
from
it
ho
ho
thought
the
lad
it
you
is
it
that
eats
up
our
hay
so
he
lost
no
time
but
took
the
steel
out
of
his
tinder
box
and
threw
it
over
the
horse
then
it
had
no
power
to
stir
from
the
spot
and
became
so
tame
that
the
lad
could
do
what
he
liked
with
it
then
he
got
on
its
back
and
rode
off
with
it
to
a
place
which
no
one
knew
of
and
there
he
put
up
the
horse
when
he
got
home
his
brothers
laughed
and
asked
how
he
had
fared
you
did
sit
long
in
the
barn
even
if
you
had
the
heart
to
go
as
far
as
the
field
well
said
boots
all
i
can
say
is
i
sat
in
the
barn
till
the
sun
rose
a
pretty
story
said
his
brothers
but
we
soon
see
how
you
have
watched
the
meadow
so
they
set
off
but
when
they
reached
it
there
stood
the
grass
as
deep
and
thick
as
it
had
been
over
night
well
the
next
john
eve
it
was
the
same
story
over
again
neither
of
the
elder
brothers
dared
to
go
out
to
the
outlying
field
to
watch
the
crop
but
boots
he
had
the
heart
to
go
and
everything
happened
just
as
it
had
the
year
before
first
a
clatter
and
an
earthquake
then
a
greater
clatter
and
another
earthquake
and
so
on
a
third
time
only
this
year
the
earthquakes
were
far
worse
than
the
year
before
then
all
at
once
everything
was
still
as
death
and
the
lad
heard
how
something
was
cropping
the
grass
outside
the
barn
door
so
he
stole
to
the
door
and
peeped
through
a
chink
and
what
do
you
think
he
saw
why
another
horse
standing
right
up
against
the
wall
and
chewing
and
champing
with
might
and
main
it
was
far
larger
and
finer
than
that
which
came
the
year
before
and
it
had
a
saddle
on
its
back
and
a
bridle
on
its
head
and
a
full
suit
of
mail
for
a
knight
lay
by
its
side
all
of
silver
and
as
splendid
as
you
would
wish
to
see
ho
ho
said
boots
to
himself
it
you
that
gobbles
up
our
hay
is
it
and
with
that
he
took
the
steel
out
of
his
tinder
box
and
threw
it
over
the
horse
crest
then
it
stood
as
still
as
a
lamb
well
the
lad
rode
this
horse
too
to
the
hiding
place
where
he
kept
the
other
one
and
after
that
he
went
home
i
suppose
you
tell
us
said
one
of
his
brothers
there
a
fine
crop
this
year
too
up
in
the
hay
field
well
so
there
is
said
boots
and
off
ran
the
others
to
see
and
there
stood
the
grass
thick
and
deep
as
it
was
the
year
before
but
they
did
give
boots
softer
words
for
all
that
now
when
the
third
john
eve
came
the
two
elder
still
had
the
heart
to
sit
out
in
the
barn
and
watch
the
grass
for
they
had
got
so
scared
at
heart
the
night
they
sat
there
before
that
they
could
get
over
the
fright
but
boots
dared
to
go
and
the
very
same
thing
happened
this
time
that
had
happened
twice
before
three
earthquakes
came
one
after
the
other
each
worse
than
the
one
which
went
before
and
when
the
last
came
the
lad
danced
about
with
the
shock
from
one
barn
wall
to
the
other
and
after
that
all
at
once
it
was
still
as
death
now
when
he
had
sat
a
little
while
he
heard
something
cropping
away
at
the
grass
outside
the
barn
so
he
stole
again
to
the
door
chink
and
peeped
out
and
there
stood
a
horse
outside
far
far
bigger
and
more
beautiful
than
the
two
he
had
taken
before
it
had
a
saddle
on
its
back
a
bridle
on
its
head
and
a
full
suit
of
mail
for
a
knight
lay
by
its
side
all
of
gold
all
more
splendid
than
anything
you
ever
saw
illustration
so
he
caught
up
the
steel
and
threw
it
over
the
horse
ho
ho
said
the
lad
to
himself
it
you
is
it
that
comes
here
eating
up
our
hay
i
soon
stop
that
so
he
caught
up
his
steel
and
threw
it
over
the
horse
neck
and
in
a
trice
it
stood
as
if
it
were
nailed
to
the
ground
and
boots
could
do
as
he
pleased
with
it
then
he
rode
off
with
it
to
the
hiding
place
where
he
kept
the
other
two
and
then
went
home
when
he
got
home
his
two
brothers
made
game
of
him
as
they
had
done
before
saying
they
could
see
he
had
watched
the
grass
well
for
he
looked
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
were
walking
in
his
sleep
and
many
other
spiteful
things
they
said
but
boots
gave
no
heed
to
them
only
asking
them
to
go
and
see
for
themselves
and
when
they
went
there
stood
the
grass
as
fine
and
deep
this
time
as
it
had
been
twice
before
now
you
must
know
that
the
king
of
the
country
where
boots
lived
had
a
daughter
whom
he
would
only
give
to
the
man
who
could
ride
up
over
the
hill
of
glass
for
there
was
a
high
high
hill
all
of
glass
as
smooth
and
slippery
as
ice
close
by
the
king
palace
upon
the
tip
top
of
the
hill
the
king
daughter
was
to
sit
with
three
golden
apples
in
her
lap
and
the
man
who
could
ride
up
and
carry
off
the
three
golden
apples
was
to
have
half
the
kingdom
and
the
princess
to
wife
this
offer
the
king
had
posted
on
all
the
church
doors
in
his
realm
and
had
given
it
out
in
many
other
kingdoms
besides
now
this
princess
was
so
lovely
that
all
who
set
eyes
on
her
loved
her
so
i
need
tell
you
how
all
the
princes
and
knights
who
heard
of
her
were
eager
to
win
her
to
wife
and
half
the
kingdom
besides
and
how
they
came
riding
from
all
parts
of
the
world
on
high
prancing
horses
and
clad
in
the
grandest
clothes
for
there
was
one
of
them
who
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
and
he
alone
was
to
win
the
princess
so
when
the
day
of
trial
came
which
the
king
had
fixed
there
was
such
a
crowd
of
princes
and
knights
under
the
glass
hill
that
it
made
head
whirl
to
look
at
them
and
every
one
in
the
country
who
could
even
crawl
along
was
off
to
the
hill
for
they
all
were
eager
to
see
the
man
who
was
to
win
the
princess
thus
the
two
elder
brothers
set
off
with
the
rest
but
as
for
boots
they
said
outright
he
should
go
with
them
for
if
they
were
seen
with
such
a
dirty
fellow
all
begrimed
with
smut
from
cleaning
their
shoes
and
sifting
cinders
in
the
they
said
folk
would
make
game
of
them
very
well
said
boots
it
all
one
to
me
i
can
go
alone
now
when
the
two
brothers
came
to
the
hill
of
glass
the
knights
and
princes
were
all
hard
at
it
riding
their
horses
till
they
were
all
in
a
foam
but
it
was
no
good
for
as
soon
as
ever
the
horses
set
foot
on
the
hill
down
they
slipped
and
there
was
one
who
could
get
a
yard
or
two
up
and
no
wonder
for
the
hill
was
as
smooth
as
a
sheet
of
glass
and
as
steep
as
a
but
all
were
eager
to
have
the
princess
and
half
the
kingdom
so
they
rode
and
slipped
and
slipped
and
rode
and
still
it
was
the
same
story
over
again
at
last
all
their
horses
were
so
weary
that
they
could
scarce
lift
a
leg
and
so
the
knights
had
to
give
up
trying
any
more
the
king
was
just
thinking
that
he
would
proclaim
a
new
trial
for
the
next
day
to
see
if
they
would
have
better
luck
when
all
at
once
a
knight
came
riding
up
on
so
brave
a
steed
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
the
like
of
it
in
his
born
days
and
the
knight
had
a
mail
of
brass
and
the
horse
a
brass
bit
in
his
mouth
so
bright
that
the
sunbeams
shone
from
it
then
all
the
others
called
out
to
him
that
he
might
just
as
well
spare
himself
the
trouble
of
riding
at
the
hill
for
it
would
lead
to
no
good
but
he
gave
no
heed
to
them
and
put
his
horse
at
the
hill
and
went
up
it
for
a
good
way
about
a
third
of
the
height
and
when
he
had
got
so
far
he
turned
his
horse
round
and
rode
down
again
so
lovely
a
knight
the
princess
thought
she
had
never
yet
seen
and
while
he
was
riding
she
sat
and
thought
to
herself
ah
how
i
wish
that
he
might
come
up
and
go
down
the
other
side
and
when
she
saw
him
turning
back
she
threw
down
one
of
the
golden
apples
after
him
and
it
rolled
down
into
his
shoe
but
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
he
rode
off
so
fast
that
no
one
could
tell
what
had
become
of
him
that
evening
all
the
knights
and
princes
were
to
go
before
the
king
that
he
who
had
ridden
so
far
up
the
hill
might
show
the
apple
which
the
princess
had
thrown
but
there
was
no
one
who
had
anything
to
show
one
after
the
other
they
all
came
but
not
a
man
of
them
could
show
the
apple
the
next
day
all
the
princes
and
knights
began
to
ride
again
and
you
may
fancy
they
had
taken
care
to
shoe
their
horses
well
but
it
was
no
use
they
rode
and
slipped
and
slipped
and
rode
just
as
they
had
done
the
day
before
and
there
was
not
one
who
could
get
so
far
as
a
yard
up
the
hill
and
when
they
had
worn
out
their
horses
so
that
they
could
not
stir
a
leg
they
were
all
forced
to
give
it
up
so
the
king
thought
he
might
as
well
proclaim
that
the
riding
should
take
place
the
day
after
for
the
last
time
just
to
give
them
one
chance
more
but
all
at
once
it
came
across
his
mind
that
he
might
as
well
wait
a
little
longer
to
see
if
the
knight
in
brass
mail
would
come
this
day
too
well
they
saw
nothing
of
him
but
all
at
once
came
one
riding
on
a
steed
far
far
braver
and
finer
than
that
on
which
the
knight
in
brass
had
ridden
and
he
had
silver
mail
and
a
silver
saddle
and
bridle
all
so
bright
that
the
sunbeams
gleamed
and
glanced
from
them
far
away
then
the
others
shouted
out
to
him
again
saying
he
might
as
well
stop
and
not
try
to
ride
up
the
hill
for
all
his
trouble
would
be
thrown
away
but
the
knight
paid
no
heed
to
them
and
rode
straight
at
the
hill
and
right
up
it
till
he
had
gone
of
the
way
and
then
he
wheeled
his
horse
around
and
rode
down
again
to
tell
the
truth
the
princess
liked
him
still
better
than
the
knight
in
brass
and
she
sat
and
wished
he
might
be
able
to
come
right
up
to
the
top
and
down
the
other
side
but
when
she
saw
him
turning
back
she
threw
the
second
apple
after
him
and
it
rolled
down
and
fell
into
his
shoe
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
had
come
down
the
hill
of
glass
he
rode
off
so
fast
that
no
one
could
see
what
became
of
him
at
even
all
were
to
go
in
before
the
king
and
the
princess
that
he
who
had
the
golden
apple
might
show
it
in
they
went
one
after
the
other
but
there
was
no
one
who
had
any
apple
to
show
the
third
day
everything
happened
as
it
had
happened
the
two
days
before
there
was
no
one
who
could
get
so
much
as
a
yard
up
the
hill
and
now
all
waited
for
the
knight
in
silver
mail
but
they
neither
saw
nor
heard
of
him
at
last
came
one
riding
on
a
steed
so
brave
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
his
match
and
the
knight
had
a
suit
of
golden
mail
and
a
golden
saddle
and
bridle
so
wondrous
bright
that
the
sunbeams
gleamed
from
them
a
mile
off
the
other
knights
and
princes
could
not
find
time
to
call
out
to
him
not
to
try
his
luck
for
they
were
amazed
to
see
how
grand
he
was
so
he
rode
at
the
hill
and
tore
up
it
like
nothing
so
that
the
princess
had
even
time
to
wish
that
he
might
get
up
the
whole
way
as
soon
as
ever
he
reached
the
top
he
took
the
third
golden
apple
from
the
princess
lap
and
then
turned
his
horse
and
rode
down
again
as
soon
as
he
got
down
he
rode
off
at
full
speed
and
was
out
of
sight
in
no
time
now
when
the
two
brothers
got
home
at
even
you
may
fancy
what
long
stories
they
told
how
the
riding
had
gone
off
that
day
and
amongst
other
things
they
had
a
deal
to
say
about
the
knight
in
golden
mail
he
just
was
a
chap
to
ride
they
said
so
grand
a
knight
is
to
be
found
in
this
wide
world
next
day
all
the
knights
and
princes
were
to
pass
before
the
king
and
the
princess
that
he
who
had
the
gold
apple
might
bring
it
forth
but
one
came
after
another
first
the
princes
then
the
knights
and
still
no
one
could
show
the
gold
apple
well
said
the
king
some
one
must
have
it
for
it
was
something
that
we
all
saw
with
our
own
eyes
how
a
man
came
and
rode
up
and
bore
it
off
so
he
commanded
that
everyone
who
was
in
the
kingdom
should
come
up
to
the
palace
and
see
if
he
could
show
the
apple
well
they
all
came
one
after
another
but
no
one
had
the
golden
apple
and
after
a
long
time
the
two
brothers
of
boots
came
they
were
the
last
of
all
so
the
king
asked
them
if
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
kingdom
who
had
come
oh
yes
said
they
we
have
a
brother
but
he
never
carried
off
the
golden
apple
he
has
stirred
out
of
the
on
any
of
the
three
days
never
mind
that
said
the
king
he
may
as
well
come
up
to
the
palace
like
the
rest
so
he
came
how
now
said
the
king
have
you
the
golden
apple
speak
out
yes
i
have
said
boots
here
is
the
first
and
here
is
the
second
and
here
is
the
third
too
and
with
that
he
pulled
all
three
golden
apples
out
of
his
pocket
and
at
the
same
time
threw
off
his
sooty
rags
and
stood
before
them
in
his
gleaming
golden
mail
yes
said
the
king
you
shall
have
my
daughter
and
half
my
kingdom
for
you
well
deserve
both
her
and
it
so
they
got
ready
for
the
wedding
and
boots
got
the
princess
to
wife
and
there
was
great
at
the
you
may
fancy
for
they
could
all
be
merry
though
they
could
ride
up
the
hill
of
glass
and
all
i
can
say
is
if
they
have
left
off
their
yet
why
they
still
at
it
the
husband
who
was
to
mind
the
house
once
on
a
time
there
was
a
man
so
mean
and
cross
that
he
never
thought
his
wife
did
anything
right
in
the
house
so
one
evening
in
time
he
came
home
scolding
and
tearing
and
showing
his
teeth
and
making
a
fuss
dear
love
do
be
so
angry
there
a
good
man
said
his
goody
let
change
our
work
i
go
out
with
the
mowers
and
mow
and
you
shall
mind
the
house
at
home
the
husband
thought
that
would
do
very
well
he
was
quite
willing
he
said
so
early
next
morning
his
goody
took
a
scythe
on
her
shoulders
and
went
out
into
the
hayfield
with
the
mowers
and
began
to
mow
but
the
man
was
to
mind
the
house
and
do
the
work
at
home
first
of
all
he
wanted
to
churn
the
butter
but
when
he
had
churned
a
while
he
grew
thirsty
and
went
down
to
the
cellar
to
tap
a
barrel
of
ale
so
just
when
he
was
putting
the
tap
into
the
cask
he
heard
overhead
the
pig
come
into
the
kitchen
then
off
he
ran
up
the
cellar
steps
with
the
tap
in
his
hand
as
fast
as
he
could
to
look
after
the
pig
lest
it
should
upset
the
churn
but
when
he
got
up
and
saw
the
pig
had
already
knocked
the
churn
over
and
stood
there
grunting
and
rooting
in
the
cream
which
was
running
all
over
the
floor
he
became
so
wild
with
rage
that
he
quite
forgot
the
ale
barrel
and
ran
at
the
pig
as
hard
as
he
could
he
caught
it
too
just
as
it
ran
out
of
doors
and
gave
it
such
a
kick
that
piggy
died
on
the
spot
then
all
at
once
he
remembered
he
had
the
tap
in
his
hand
but
when
he
got
down
to
the
cellar
every
drop
of
ale
had
run
out
of
the
cask
then
he
went
into
the
dairy
and
found
enough
cream
left
to
fill
the
churn
again
and
so
he
began
to
churn
for
butter
they
must
have
at
dinner
when
he
had
churned
a
bit
he
remembered
that
their
milking
cow
was
still
shut
up
in
its
stall
and
had
not
had
a
mouthful
to
eat
or
a
drop
to
drink
all
the
morning
though
the
sun
was
high
then
he
thought
it
was
too
far
to
take
her
down
to
the
meadow
so
he
just
get
her
up
on
the
house
top
for
the
house
you
must
know
was
thatched
with
sods
and
a
fine
crop
of
grass
was
growing
there
now
their
house
lay
close
up
against
a
steep
rock
and
he
thought
if
he
laid
a
plank
across
to
the
roof
at
the
back
he
easily
get
the
cow
up
but
still
he
could
not
leave
the
churn
for
there
was
their
little
babe
crawling
about
the
floor
and
if
i
leave
it
he
thought
the
child
is
sure
to
upset
it
so
he
took
the
churn
on
his
back
and
went
out
with
it
then
he
thought
he
better
water
the
cow
before
he
turned
her
out
on
the
thatch
and
he
took
up
a
bucket
to
draw
water
out
of
the
well
but
as
he
stooped
down
at
the
brink
of
the
well
all
the
cream
ran
out
of
the
churn
over
his
shoulders
about
his
neck
and
down
into
the
well
now
it
was
near
dinner
time
and
he
had
not
even
got
butter
yet
so
he
thought
he
best
boil
the
porridge
and
he
filled
the
pot
with
water
and
hung
it
over
the
fire
when
he
had
done
that
he
thought
the
cow
might
perhaps
fall
off
the
thatch
and
break
her
legs
or
her
neck
so
he
got
up
on
the
house
to
tie
her
up
one
end
of
the
rope
he
made
fast
to
the
cow
neck
and
the
other
he
slipped
down
the
chimney
and
tied
round
his
own
waist
he
had
to
make
haste
for
the
water
now
began
to
boil
in
the
pot
and
he
had
still
to
grind
the
oatmeal
so
he
began
to
grind
away
but
while
he
was
hard
at
it
down
fell
the
cow
off
the
housetop
after
all
and
as
she
fell
she
dragged
the
man
up
the
chimney
by
the
rope
there
he
stuck
fast
and
as
for
the
cow
she
hung
halfway
down
the
wall
swinging
between
heaven
and
earth
for
she
could
neither
get
down
nor
up
and
now
the
goody
had
waited
seven
lengths
and
seven
breadths
for
her
husband
to
come
and
call
them
home
to
dinner
but
never
a
call
they
had
at
last
she
thought
she
waited
long
enough
and
went
home
when
she
got
there
and
saw
the
cow
hanging
in
such
an
ugly
place
she
ran
up
and
cut
the
rope
in
two
with
her
scythe
but
as
she
did
this
down
came
her
husband
out
of
the
chimney
and
so
when
his
old
dame
came
inside
the
kitchen
there
she
found
him
standing
on
his
head
in
the
porridge
pot
little
freddy
with
his
fiddle
once
there
was
a
farmer
who
had
an
only
son
the
lad
had
had
very
poor
health
so
he
could
not
go
out
to
work
in
the
field
his
name
was
freddy
but
since
he
remained
such
a
wee
bit
of
a
fellow
they
called
him
little
freddy
at
home
there
was
but
little
to
eat
and
nothing
at
all
to
burn
so
his
father
went
about
the
country
trying
to
get
the
boy
a
place
as
cowherd
or
errand
boy
but
there
was
no
one
who
would
take
the
weakly
little
lad
till
they
came
to
the
sheriff
he
was
ready
to
take
him
for
he
had
just
sent
off
his
errand
boy
and
there
was
no
one
who
would
fill
his
place
for
everybody
knew
the
sheriff
was
a
great
miser
but
the
farmer
thought
it
was
better
there
than
nowhere
he
would
get
his
food
for
all
the
pay
he
was
to
get
was
his
board
there
was
nothing
said
about
wages
or
clothes
when
the
lad
had
served
three
years
he
wanted
to
leave
and
the
sheriff
gave
him
all
his
wages
at
one
time
he
was
to
have
a
penny
a
year
it
could
well
be
less
said
the
sheriff
and
so
he
got
three
pence
in
all
as
for
little
freddy
he
thought
it
was
a
great
sum
for
he
had
never
owned
so
much
but
for
all
that
he
asked
if
he
was
to
have
anything
for
clothes
for
those
he
had
on
were
worn
to
rags
he
had
not
had
any
new
ones
since
he
came
to
the
sheriff
three
years
ago
you
have
what
we
agreed
on
said
the
sheriff
and
three
whole
pennies
besides
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
be
off
so
little
freddy
went
into
the
kitchen
and
got
a
little
food
in
his
knapsack
and
after
that
he
set
off
on
the
road
to
buy
himself
more
clothes
he
was
both
merry
and
glad
for
he
had
never
seen
a
penny
before
and
every
now
and
then
he
felt
in
his
pockets
as
he
went
along
to
see
if
he
had
them
all
three
so
when
he
had
gone
far
and
farther
than
far
he
got
up
on
top
of
the
mountains
he
was
not
strong
on
his
legs
and
had
to
rest
every
now
and
then
and
then
he
counted
and
counted
how
many
pennies
he
had
and
now
he
came
to
a
great
plain
overgrown
with
moss
there
he
sat
down
and
began
to
see
if
his
money
was
all
right
suddenly
a
beggarman
appeared
before
him
so
tall
and
big
that
when
he
got
a
good
look
at
him
and
saw
his
height
and
length
the
lad
began
to
scream
and
screech
do
you
be
afraid
said
the
beggarman
i
do
you
no
harm
i
came
only
to
beg
you
for
a
penny
dear
me
said
the
lad
i
have
only
three
pennies
and
with
them
i
was
going
to
town
to
buy
clothes
it
is
worse
for
me
than
for
you
said
the
beggarman
i
have
not
one
penny
and
i
am
still
more
ragged
than
you
well
that
is
so
you
shall
have
it
said
the
lad
when
he
had
walked
on
a
while
he
grew
weary
again
and
sat
down
to
rest
suddenly
another
beggarman
stood
before
him
and
this
one
was
still
taller
and
uglier
than
the
first
when
the
lad
saw
how
very
tall
and
ugly
and
long
he
was
he
began
to
scream
again
now
do
you
be
afraid
of
me
said
the
beggar
i
do
you
no
harm
i
came
only
to
beg
for
a
penny
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
the
lad
i
have
only
two
pennies
and
with
them
i
was
going
to
the
town
to
buy
clothes
if
i
had
only
met
you
sooner
then
it
worse
for
me
than
for
you
said
the
beggarman
i
have
no
penny
and
a
bigger
body
and
less
clothing
well
you
may
have
it
said
the
lad
so
he
went
away
farther
till
he
got
weary
and
then
he
sat
down
to
rest
but
he
had
scarcely
sat
down
when
a
third
beggarman
came
to
him
this
one
was
so
tall
and
ugly
and
long
that
the
lad
had
to
look
up
and
up
right
up
to
the
sky
and
when
he
took
him
all
in
with
his
eyes
and
saw
how
very
very
tall
and
ugly
and
ragged
he
was
he
fell
and
screaming
again
illustration
the
lad
had
to
look
up
right
up
into
the
sky
now
do
you
be
afraid
of
me
my
lad
said
the
beggarman
i
do
you
no
harm
for
i
am
only
a
beggarman
who
begs
you
for
a
penny
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
the
lad
i
have
only
one
penny
left
and
with
it
i
was
going
to
the
town
to
buy
clothes
if
i
had
only
met
you
sooner
then
as
for
that
said
the
beggarman
i
have
no
penny
at
all
that
i
have
and
a
bigger
body
and
less
clothes
so
it
is
worse
for
me
than
for
you
yes
said
little
freddy
he
must
have
the
penny
then
there
was
no
help
for
it
for
so
each
beggarman
would
have
one
penny
and
he
would
have
nothing
well
said
the
beggarman
since
you
have
such
a
good
heart
that
you
gave
away
all
that
you
had
in
the
world
i
will
give
you
a
wish
for
each
penny
for
you
must
know
it
was
the
same
beggarman
who
had
got
them
all
three
he
had
only
changed
his
shape
each
time
that
the
lad
might
not
know
him
again
i
have
always
had
such
a
longing
to
hear
a
fiddle
go
and
see
folk
so
merry
and
glad
that
they
could
help
dancing
said
the
lad
and
so
if
i
may
wish
what
i
choose
i
will
wish
myself
such
a
fiddle
that
everything
that
has
life
must
dance
to
its
tune
that
you
may
have
said
the
beggarman
but
it
is
a
sorry
wish
you
must
wish
something
better
for
the
other
two
pennies
i
have
always
had
such
a
love
for
hunting
and
shooting
said
little
freddy
so
if
i
may
wish
what
i
choose
i
will
wish
myself
such
a
gun
that
i
shall
hit
everything
i
aim
at
were
it
ever
so
far
off
that
you
may
have
said
the
beggarman
but
it
is
a
sorry
wish
too
you
must
wish
better
for
the
last
penny
i
have
always
had
a
longing
to
be
in
company
with
folks
who
were
kind
and
good
said
little
freddy
and
so
if
i
could
get
what
i
wish
i
would
wish
it
to
be
so
that
no
one
can
say
to
the
first
thing
i
ask
that
wish
is
not
so
sorry
said
the
beggarman
and
off
he
strode
between
the
hills
and
freddy
saw
him
no
more
so
the
lad
lay
down
to
sleep
and
the
next
day
he
came
down
from
the
mountain
with
his
fiddle
and
his
gun
first
he
went
to
the
storekeeper
and
asked
for
clothes
next
at
a
farm
he
asked
for
a
horse
and
at
a
second
for
a
sleigh
and
at
another
place
he
asked
for
a
fur
coat
no
one
said
him
nay
even
the
stingiest
folk
were
all
forced
to
give
him
what
he
asked
for
at
last
he
went
through
the
country
as
a
fine
gentleman
and
had
his
horse
and
his
sleigh
when
he
had
gone
a
bit
he
met
the
sheriff
whose
servant
he
had
been
good
day
master
said
little
freddy
as
he
pulled
up
and
took
off
his
hat
good
day
said
the
sheriff
but
when
was
i
ever
your
master
oh
yes
said
little
freddy
do
you
remember
how
i
served
you
three
years
for
three
pence
my
goodness
now
said
the
sheriff
you
have
grown
rich
in
a
hurry
and
pray
how
was
it
that
you
got
to
be
such
a
fine
gentleman
oh
that
is
a
long
story
said
little
freddy
and
are
you
so
full
of
fun
that
you
carry
a
fiddle
about
with
you
asked
the
sheriff
yes
yes
said
freddy
i
have
always
had
such
a
longing
to
get
folk
to
dance
but
the
funniest
thing
of
all
is
this
gun
for
it
brings
down
almost
anything
that
i
aim
at
however
far
it
may
be
off
do
you
see
that
magpie
yonder
sitting
in
the
spruce
fir
what
will
you
give
me
if
i
hit
it
as
we
stand
here
well
said
the
sheriff
and
he
laughed
when
he
said
it
i
give
you
all
the
money
i
have
in
my
pocket
and
i
go
and
fetch
it
when
it
falls
for
he
never
thought
it
possible
for
any
gun
to
carry
so
far
but
as
the
gun
went
off
down
fell
the
magpie
and
into
a
great
bramble
thicket
and
away
went
the
sheriff
up
into
the
bramble
after
it
and
he
picked
it
up
and
held
it
up
high
for
the
lad
to
see
but
just
then
little
freddy
began
to
play
his
fiddle
and
the
sheriff
began
to
dance
and
the
thorns
to
tear
him
but
still
the
lad
played
on
and
the
sheriff
danced
and
cried
and
begged
till
his
clothes
flew
to
tatters
and
he
scarce
had
a
thread
to
his
back
yes
said
little
freddy
now
i
think
you
about
as
ragged
as
i
was
when
i
left
your
service
so
now
you
may
get
off
with
what
you
have
but
first
the
sheriff
had
to
pay
him
all
the
money
that
he
had
in
his
pocket
so
when
the
lad
came
to
town
he
turned
into
an
inn
and
there
he
began
to
play
and
all
who
came
danced
and
laughed
and
were
merry
and
so
the
lad
lived
without
any
care
for
all
the
folks
liked
him
and
no
one
would
say
nay
to
anything
he
asked
but
one
evening
just
as
they
were
all
in
the
midst
of
their
fun
up
came
the
watchmen
to
drag
the
lad
off
to
the
town
hall
for
the
sheriff
had
laid
a
charge
against
him
and
said
he
had
waylaid
him
and
robbed
him
and
nearly
taken
his
life
and
now
he
was
to
be
hanged
the
people
would
hear
of
nothing
else
but
little
freddy
had
a
cure
for
all
trouble
and
that
was
his
fiddle
he
began
to
play
on
it
and
the
watchmen
fell
and
they
danced
and
they
laughed
till
they
gasped
for
breath
so
soldiers
and
the
guard
were
sent
to
take
him
but
it
was
no
better
with
them
than
with
the
watchmen
when
little
freddy
played
his
fiddle
they
were
all
bound
to
dance
and
dance
as
long
as
he
could
lift
a
finger
to
play
a
tune
but
they
were
half
dead
long
before
he
was
tired
at
last
they
stole
a
march
on
him
and
took
him
while
he
lay
asleep
by
night
now
that
they
had
caught
him
they
could
condemn
him
to
be
hanged
on
the
spot
and
away
they
hurried
him
to
the
gallows
tree
there
a
great
crowd
of
people
flocked
together
to
see
this
wonder
and
the
sheriff
too
was
there
he
was
glad
to
get
even
at
last
for
the
money
and
the
clothes
he
had
lost
and
to
see
the
lad
hanged
with
his
own
eyes
and
here
came
little
freddy
carrying
his
fiddle
and
his
gun
slowly
he
mounted
the
steps
of
the
gallows
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
he
sat
down
and
asked
if
they
could
deny
him
a
wish
and
if
he
might
have
leave
to
do
one
thing
he
had
such
a
longing
he
said
to
scrape
a
tune
and
play
a
bar
on
his
fiddle
before
they
hanged
him
no
no
they
said
it
were
sin
and
shame
to
deny
him
that
for
you
know
no
one
could
say
nay
to
what
he
asked
but
the
sheriff
begged
them
not
to
let
him
have
leave
to
touch
a
string
else
it
would
be
all
over
with
them
altogether
if
the
lad
leave
he
begged
them
to
bind
him
to
the
birch
that
stood
there
little
freddy
was
not
slow
in
getting
his
fiddle
to
speak
and
all
that
were
there
fell
at
once
those
who
went
on
two
legs
and
those
who
went
on
four
both
the
dean
and
the
parson
the
lawyer
and
the
sheriff
masters
and
men
dogs
and
pigs
they
all
danced
and
laughed
and
barked
and
squealed
at
one
another
some
danced
till
they
lay
down
and
gasped
some
danced
till
they
fell
in
a
swoon
it
went
badly
with
all
of
them
but
worst
of
all
with
the
sheriff
for
there
he
stood
bound
to
the
birch
and
he
danced
till
he
scraped
the
clothes
off
his
back
i
dare
say
it
was
a
sorry
looking
sight
and
a
sore
back
but
there
was
not
one
of
them
who
thought
of
doing
anything
to
little
freddy
and
away
he
went
with
his
fiddle
and
his
gun
whither
he
chose
and
he
lived
merrily
and
happily
all
his
days
for
there
was
no
one
who
could
say
nay
to
the
first
thing
he
asked
for
