with
a

monsieur
sprang
toward

in

he
was

i
flash
of
at
the
the
landlord
stopped
me
here
lad
take
a
candle
the
stairs
are
dark
and
since
i
like
your
looks
i
would
not
have
you
break
your
neck
and
give
the
house
a
bad
name
i
said
no
fear
of
that
my
house
has
a
good
name
there
is
no
fairer
inn
in
all
paris
and
your
chamber
is
a
good
chamber
though
you
will
have
larger
doubtless
when
you
are
minister
of
finance
this
raised
a
laugh
among
the
tavern
idlers
for
i
had
been
bragging
a
bit
of
my
prospects
i
retorted
when
i
am
maître
jacques
look
out
for
a
rise
in
your
taxes
the
laugh
was
turned
on
mine
host
and
i
retired
with
the
honours
of
that
encounter
and
though
the
stairs
were
the
steepest
i
ever
climbed
i
had
the
breath
and
the
spirit
to
whistle
all
the
way
up
what
mattered
it
that
already
i
ached
in
every
bone
that
the
stair
was
long
and
my
bed
but
a
heap
of
straw
in
the
garret
of
a
mean
inn
in
a
poor
quarter
i
was
in
paris
the
city
of
my
dreams
i
am
a
broux
of
quentin
the
great
world
has
never
heard
of
the
broux
no
matter
they
have
existed
these
hundreds
of
years
masters
of
the
forest
and
faithful
servants
of
the
dukes
of
quentin
the
great
world
has
heard
of
the
quentins
i
warrant
you
as
loudly
as
it
has
of
sully
and
villeroi
trémouille
and
biron
that
is
enough
for
the
broux
i
was
brought
up
to
worship
the
saints
and
le
duc
and
i
loved
and
revered
them
alike
by
faith
for
le
duc
at
court
seemed
as
far
away
from
us
as
the
saints
in
heaven
but
the
year
after
king
henry
iii
was
murdered
monsieur
came
to
live
on
his
estate
to
make
high
and
low
love
him
for
himself
in
that
bloody
time
when
the
king
of
navarre
and
the
two
leagues
were
tearing
our
poor
france
asunder
le
duc
found
himself
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
sea
he
was
no
friend
to
the
league
for
years
he
had
stood
between
the
king
his
master
and
the
machinations
of
the
guises
on
the
other
hand
he
was
no
friend
to
the
huguenots
to
seat
a
heretic
on
the
throne
of
france
were
to
deny
god
he
said
therefore
he
came
home
to
quentin
where
he
abode
in
quiet
for
some
three
years
to
the
great
wonderment
of
all
the
world
had
he
been
a
cautious
man
a
man
who
looked
a
long
way
ahead
his
compeers
would
have
understood
readily
enough
that
he
was
waiting
to
see
how
the
cat
would
jump
taking
no
part
in
the
quarrel
lest
he
should
mix
with
the
losing
side
but
this
theory
jibed
so
ill
with
character
that
not
even
his
worst
detractor
could
accept
it
for
he
was
known
to
all
as
a
hotspur
a
man
who
acted
quickly
and
seldom
counted
the
cost
therefore
his
present
conduct
was
a
riddle
nor
could
any
of
the
emissaries
from
king
or
league
who
came
from
time
to
time
to
enlist
his
aid
and
went
away
without
it
read
the
answer
the
puzzle
was
too
deep
for
them
yet
it
was
only
this
to
monsieur
honour
was
more
than
a
pretty
word
if
he
could
not
find
his
cause
honest
he
would
not
draw
his
sword
though
all
the
curs
in
the
land
called
him
coward
thus
he
stayed
alone
in
the
château
for
a
long
irksome
three
years
monsieur
was
not
of
a
reflective
mind
content
to
stand
aside
and
watch
while
other
men
fought
out
great
issues
it
was
a
weary
procession
of
days
to
him
his
only
son
a
lad
a
few
years
older
than
i
shared
none
of
his
father
scruples
and
refused
to
follow
him
into
exile
he
remained
in
paris
where
they
knew
how
to
be
gay
in
spite
of
sieges
therefore
i
the
forester
son
whom
monsieur
took
for
a
page
had
a
chance
to
come
closer
to
my
lord
and
be
more
to
him
than
a
mere
servant
and
i
loved
him
as
the
dogs
did
aye
and
admired
him
for
a
fortitude
almost
more
than
human
in
that
he
could
hold
himself
passive
here
in
farthest
picardie
whilst
in
normandie
and
île
de
france
battles
raged
and
towns
fell
and
captains
won
glory
at
length
in
the
opening
of
the
year
le
duc
began
to
have
a
frequent
visitor
a
gentleman
in
no
wise
remarkable
save
for
that
he
was
accorded
long
interviews
with
monsieur
after
these
visits
my
lord
was
always
in
great
spirits
putting
on
frisky
airs
like
a
stallion
when
he
is
led
out
of
the
stable
i
looked
for
something
to
happen
and
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
when
le
duc
announced
one
day
quite
without
warning
that
he
was
done
with
quentin
and
would
be
off
in
the
morning
for
mantes
i
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
joy
when
he
added
that
he
should
take
me
with
him
i
knew
the
king
of
navarre
was
at
mantes
at
last
we
were
going
to
make
history
there
was
no
bound
to
my
golden
dreams
no
limit
to
my
future
but
my
house
of
cards
suffered
a
rude
tumble
and
by
no
hand
but
my
father
he
came
to
monsieur
and
presuming
on
an
old
privilege
begged
him
to
leave
me
at
home
i
have
lost
two
sons
in
monsieur
service
he
said
jean
hunting
in
this
forest
and
blaise
in
the
fray
at
blois
i
have
never
grudged
them
to
monsieur
but
félix
is
all
i
have
left
thus
it
came
about
that
i
was
left
behind
hidden
in
the
when
my
duke
rode
away
i
could
not
watch
his
going
though
the
days
passed
drearily
yet
they
passed
time
does
pass
at
length
even
when
one
is
young
it
was
july
the
king
of
navarre
had
moved
up
to
denis
in
his
siege
of
paris
but
most
folk
thought
he
would
never
win
the
city
the
hotbed
of
the
league
of
le
duc
we
heard
no
word
till
one
night
a
chance
traveller
putting
up
at
the
inn
in
the
village
told
a
startling
tale
the
duke
of
quentin
though
known
to
have
been
at
mantes
and
strongly
suspected
of
espousing
navarre
cause
had
ridden
calmly
into
paris
and
opened
his
hôtel
it
was
madness
madness
sheer
and
stark
thus
far
his
religion
had
saved
him
yet
any
day
he
might
fall
under
the
swords
of
the
leaguers
my
father
came
after
hearing
this
tale
to
where
i
was
lying
on
the
grass
the
warm
summer
night
thinking
hard
thoughts
of
him
for
keeping
me
at
home
and
spoiling
my
chances
in
life
he
gave
me
straightway
the
whole
of
the
story
long
before
it
was
over
i
had
sprung
to
my
feet
do
you
still
wish
to
join
le
duc
he
said
father
was
all
i
could
gasp
then
you
shall
go
he
answered
that
was
not
bad
for
an
old
man
who
had
lost
two
sons
for
monsieur
i
set
out
in
the
morning
light
of
baggage
purse
and
heart
i
can
tell
naught
of
the
journey
for
i
heeded
only
that
at
the
end
of
it
lay
paris
i
reached
the
city
one
day
at
sundown
and
entered
without
a
passport
at
the
denis
gate
the
warders
being
hardly
so
strict
as
mayenne
supposed
i
was
dusty
and
hungry
in
no
guise
to
present
myself
before
monsieur
wherefore
i
went
no
farther
that
night
than
the
inn
of
the
amour
de
dieu
in
the
rue
des
coupejarrets
far
below
my
garret
window
lay
the
street
a
trench
between
the
high
houses
scarce
eight
feet
off
loomed
the
dark
wall
of
the
house
opposite
to
me
fresh
from
the
wide
woods
of
quentin
it
seemed
the
desire
of
paris
folk
to
outhuddle
in
closeness
the
rabbits
in
a
warren
so
ingenious
were
they
at
contriving
to
waste
no
inch
of
open
space
that
the
houses
standing
at
the
base
but
a
scant
street
width
apart
ever
jutted
out
farther
at
each
story
till
they
looked
to
be
fairly
toppling
together
i
could
see
into
the
windows
up
and
down
the
way
see
the
people
move
about
within
hear
opposite
neighbours
call
to
each
other
but
across
from
my
aery
were
no
lights
and
no
people
for
that
house
was
shuttered
tight
from
attic
to
cellar
its
dark
front
as
expressionless
as
a
blind
face
i
marvelled
how
it
came
to
stand
empty
in
that
teeming
quarter
too
tired
however
to
wonder
long
i
blew
out
the
candle
and
was
asleep
before
i
could
shut
my
eyes
crash
crash
crash
i
sprang
out
of
bed
in
a
panic
thinking
henry
of
navarre
was
bombarding
paris
then
being
fully
roused
i
perceived
that
the
noise
was
thunder
from
the
window
i
peered
into
floods
of
rain
the
peals
died
away
suddenly
came
a
terrific
and
i
cried
out
in
astonishment
for
the
shutter
opposite
was
open
and
i
had
a
vivid
vision
of
three
men
in
the
window
then
all
was
dark
again
and
the
thunder
shook
the
roof
i
stood
straining
my
eyes
into
the
night
waiting
for
the
next
flash
when
it
came
it
showed
me
the
window
barred
as
before
flash
followed
flash
i
winked
the
rain
from
my
eyes
and
peered
in
vain
the
shutter
remained
closed
as
if
it
had
never
been
opened
sleep
rolled
over
me
in
a
great
wave
as
i
groped
my
way
back
to
bed
ii
the
amour
de
when
i
woke
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
shining
broadly
into
the
room
glinting
in
the
little
pools
of
water
on
the
floor
i
stared
at
them
till
recollection
came
to
me
of
the
and
the
open
shutter
and
the
three
men
i
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
window
the
shutters
opposite
were
closed
the
house
just
as
i
had
seen
it
first
save
for
the
long
streaks
of
wet
down
the
wall
the
street
below
was
one
vast
puddle
at
all
events
the
storm
was
no
dream
as
i
half
believed
the
vision
to
be
i
dressed
speedily
and
went
the
was
deserted
save
for
maître
jacques
who
with
heat
demanded
of
me
whether
i
took
myself
for
a
prince
that
i
lay
in
bed
till
all
decent
folk
had
been
hours
about
their
business
and
then
expected
breakfast
however
he
brought
me
a
meal
and
i
made
no
complaint
that
it
was
a
poor
one
you
have
strange
neighbours
in
the
house
opposite
said
i
he
started
and
the
thin
wine
he
was
setting
before
me
splashed
over
on
the
table
what
neighbours
why
they
who
close
their
shutters
when
other
folks
would
keep
them
open
and
open
them
when
others
keep
them
shut
i
said
airily
last
night
i
saw
three
men
in
the
window
opposite
mine
he
laughed
aha
my
lad
your
head
is
not
used
to
our
paris
wines
that
is
how
you
came
to
see
visions
nonsense
i
cried
nettled
your
wine
is
too
well
watered
for
that
let
me
tell
you
maître
jacques
then
you
dreamed
it
he
said
huffily
the
proof
is
that
no
one
has
lived
in
that
house
these
twenty
years
now
i
had
plenty
to
trouble
about
without
troubling
my
head
over
but
i
was
vexed
with
him
for
putting
me
off
so
with
a
fine
conceit
of
my
own
shrewdness
i
said
if
it
was
only
a
dream
how
came
you
to
spill
the
wine
he
gave
me
a
keen
glance
and
then
with
a
look
round
to
see
that
no
one
was
by
leaned
across
the
table
up
to
me
you
are
sharp
as
a
gimlet
said
he
i
see
i
may
as
well
tell
you
first
as
last
marry
an
you
will
have
it
the
place
is
haunted
holy
virgin
i
cried
crossing
myself
aye
twenty
years
ago
in
the
great
massacre
you
know
naught
of
that
you
were
not
born
i
take
it
and
besides
are
a
country
boy
but
i
was
here
and
i
know
a
man
dared
not
stir
out
of
doors
that
dark
day
the
gutters
ran
blood
and
that
house
what
happened
in
that
house
why
it
was
the
house
of
a
huguenot
gentleman
de
béthune
he
answered
bringing
out
the
name
hesitatingly
in
a
low
voice
they
were
all
put
to
the
sword
the
whole
household
it
was
guise
work
the
duc
de
guise
sat
on
his
white
horse
in
this
very
street
here
while
it
was
going
on
parbleu
that
was
a
day
mon
dieu
yes
well
that
is
an
old
story
now
he
resumed
in
a
different
tone
years
ago
that
was
such
things
do
happen
now
but
the
people
they
have
not
forgotten
they
will
not
go
near
that
house
no
one
will
live
there
and
have
others
seen
as
well
as
i
so
they
say
but
i
not
let
it
be
talked
of
on
my
premises
folk
might
get
to
think
them
too
near
the
haunted
house
is
another
matter
with
you
though
since
you
have
had
the
vision
there
were
three
men
i
said
young
men
in
sombre
dress
de
béthune
and
his
cousins
what
further
did
you
hear
shrieks
there
was
naught
further
i
said
shuddering
i
saw
them
for
the
space
of
a
plain
as
i
see
you
the
next
minute
the
shutters
were
closed
again
is
a
marvel
he
answered
gravely
but
i
know
what
has
disturbed
them
in
their
graves
the
heretics
it
is
that
they
have
lost
their
leader
i
stared
at
him
blankly
and
he
added
their
henry
of
navarre
but
he
is
not
lost
there
has
been
no
battle
lost
to
them
said
maître
jacques
when
he
turns
catholic
oh
i
cried
oh
he
mocked
you
come
from
the
country
you
do
know
these
things
but
the
king
of
navarre
is
too
a
heretic
bah
time
bends
the
stiffest
neck
tell
me
this
for
what
do
the
learned
doctors
sit
in
council
at
mantes
oh
said
i
bewildered
you
tell
me
news
maître
jacques
if
henry
of
navarre
be
not
a
catholic
before
the
month
is
out
spit
me
on
my
own
jack
he
answered
eying
me
rather
keenly
as
he
added
it
should
be
welcome
news
to
you
welcome
was
it
it
made
plain
the
reason
monsieur
change
of
base
yet
it
was
my
duty
to
be
discreet
i
am
glad
to
hear
of
any
heretic
coming
to
the
faith
i
said
pshaw
he
cried
to
the
devil
with
pretences
is
an
open
secret
that
your
patron
has
gone
over
to
navarre
i
know
naught
of
it
well
pardieu
my
lord
mayenne
does
then
if
when
he
came
to
paris
de
quentin
counted
that
the
league
would
not
know
his
parleyings
he
was
a
fool
his
parleyings
i
echoed
feebly
aye
the
boy
in
the
street
knows
he
has
been
with
navarre
for
mark
you
all
france
has
been
wondering
these
many
months
where
quentin
was
coming
out
his
movements
do
not
go
unnoted
like
a
yokel
but
faith
he
is
not
dull
he
understands
that
well
enough
nay
is
my
belief
he
came
into
the
city
in
pure
effrontery
to
show
them
how
much
he
dared
he
is
a
bold
blade
your
duke
and
mon
dieu
it
had
its
effect
for
the
leaguers
have
been
so
agape
with
astonishment
ever
since
that
they
have
not
raised
a
finger
against
him
yet
you
do
not
think
him
safe
safe
say
you
safe
pardieu
if
you
walked
into
a
cage
of
lions
and
they
did
not
in
the
first
instant
eat
you
would
you
therefore
feel
safe
he
was
stark
mad
to
come
to
paris
there
is
no
man
the
league
hates
more
now
they
know
they
have
lost
him
and
no
man
they
can
afford
so
ill
to
spare
to
king
henry
a
great
catholic
noble
he
would
be
meat
and
drink
to
the
béarnais
he
was
mad
to
come
here
and
yet
nothing
has
happened
to
him
verily
fortune
favours
the
brave
no
nothing
has
happened
yet
but
i
tell
you
true
félix
i
had
rather
be
the
poor
innkeeper
of
the
amour
de
dieu
than
stand
in
de
quentin
shoes
i
was
talking
with
the
men
here
last
night
i
said
there
was
not
one
but
had
a
good
word
for
monsieur
aye
so
they
have
they
like
his
pluck
and
if
the
league
kills
him
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
the
people
will
rise
up
and
make
the
town
lively
but
that
will
not
profit
de
quentin
if
he
is
dead
i
would
not
be
dampened
though
by
an
old
croaker
nay
maître
if
the
people
are
with
him
the
league
will
not
dare
there
you
fool
yourself
my
springald
if
there
is
one
thing
which
the
nobles
of
the
league
neither
know
nor
care
about
it
is
what
the
people
think
they
sit
wrangling
over
their
french
league
and
their
spanish
league
their
kings
and
their
princesses
and
what
this
lord
does
and
that
lord
threatens
and
they
give
no
heed
at
all
to
us
us
the
people
but
they
will
find
out
their
mistake
some
day
they
will
be
taught
that
the
nobles
are
not
all
of
france
there
will
come
a
reckoning
when
more
blood
will
flow
in
paris
than
ever
flowed
on
bartholomew
day
they
think
we
are
chained
down
do
they
pardieu
there
will
come
a
day
i
scarcely
knew
the
man
his
face
was
flushed
his
eyes
sparkling
as
if
they
saw
more
than
the
common
room
and
mean
street
but
as
i
stared
the
glow
faded
and
he
said
in
a
lower
tone
at
least
it
will
happen
unless
henry
of
navarre
comes
to
save
us
from
it
he
is
a
good
fellow
this
navarre
they
say
he
can
never
enter
paris
they
say
lies
let
him
but
leave
his
heresies
behind
him
and
he
can
enter
paris
mayenne
does
not
think
so
no
but
mayenne
knows
little
of
what
goes
on
he
does
not
keep
an
inn
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
he
stated
the
fact
so
gravely
that
i
had
to
laugh
laugh
if
you
like
but
i
tell
you
félix
broux
my
is
not
the
only
place
where
they
make
kings
we
do
it
too
we
of
the
rue
coupejarrets
well
said
i
i
leave
you
then
to
make
kings
i
must
be
off
to
my
duke
what
the
scot
maître
he
dropped
the
politician
and
was
all
innkeeper
in
a
second
a
crown
i
cried
in
indignation
do
you
think
i
am
made
of
crowns
remember
i
am
not
yet
minister
of
finance
no
but
soon
will
be
he
grinned
besides
what
i
ask
is
little
enough
god
knows
do
you
think
food
is
cheap
in
a
siege
then
i
pray
navarre
may
come
soon
and
end
it
amen
to
that
said
old
jacques
quite
gravely
if
he
comes
a
catholic
it
can
not
be
too
soon
i
counted
out
my
pennies
with
a
last
grumble
they
ought
to
call
this
the
rue
coupebourses
he
laughed
he
could
afford
to
with
my
silver
jingling
in
his
pouch
he
embraced
me
tenderly
at
parting
and
hoped
to
see
me
again
at
his
inn
i
smiled
to
myself
i
had
not
come
to
paris
i
to
stay
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
iii
le
duc
is
well
i
stepped
out
briskly
from
the
inn
pausing
now
and
again
to
inquire
my
way
to
the
hôtel
quentin
which
stood
i
knew
in
the
quartier
marais
where
all
the
grand
folk
lived
once
i
had
found
the
broad
straight
rue
denis
all
i
need
do
was
to
follow
it
over
the
hill
down
to
the
my
eyes
were
free
therefore
to
stare
at
all
the
strange
sights
of
the
great
city
markets
and
shops
and
churches
and
prisons
but
most
of
all
did
i
gape
at
the
crowds
in
the
streets
i
had
scarce
realized
there
were
so
many
people
in
the
world
as
passed
me
that
summer
morning
in
the
town
of
paris
bewilderingly
busy
and
gay
the
place
appeared
to
my
country
eyes
though
in
truth
at
that
time
paris
was
at
its
very
worst
the
spirit
being
crushed
out
of
it
by
the
sieges
and
the
iron
rule
of
the
sixteen
i
knew
little
enough
of
politics
and
yet
i
was
not
so
dull
as
not
to
see
that
great
events
must
happen
soon
a
crisis
had
come
i
looked
at
the
people
i
passed
who
were
going
about
their
business
so
tranquilly
every
one
of
them
must
be
either
mayenne
man
or
navarre
before
a
week
was
out
these
peaceable
citizens
might
be
using
pikes
for
tools
and
exchanging
bullets
for
good
mornings
whatever
happened
here
was
i
in
paris
in
the
thick
of
it
my
feet
fairly
danced
under
me
i
could
not
reach
the
hôtel
soon
enough
half
was
i
glad
of
monsieur
danger
for
it
gave
me
chance
to
show
what
stuff
i
was
made
of
live
for
him
die
for
him
whatever
fate
could
offer
i
was
ready
for
the
hôtel
when
at
length
i
arrived
before
it
was
no
disappointment
here
one
did
not
wait
till
midday
to
see
the
sun
the
street
was
of
decent
width
and
the
houses
held
themselves
back
with
reserve
like
the
proud
gentlemen
who
inhabited
them
nor
did
one
here
regret
his
possession
of
a
nose
as
he
was
forced
to
do
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
of
all
the
mansions
in
the
place
the
hôtel
quentin
was
in
my
opinion
the
most
imposing
carved
and
ornamented
and
stately
with
gardens
at
the
side
but
there
was
about
it
none
of
that
stir
and
liveliness
one
expects
to
see
about
the
houses
of
the
great
no
visitors
passed
in
or
out
and
the
big
iron
gates
were
shut
as
if
none
were
looked
for
of
a
truth
the
persons
who
visited
monsieur
these
days
preferred
to
slip
in
by
the
postern
after
nightfall
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
time
when
they
were
proud
to
be
seen
in
his
hall
beyond
the
grilles
a
sentry
in
the
green
and
scarlet
of
stood
on
guard
and
i
called
out
to
him
boldly
he
turned
at
once
then
looked
as
if
the
sight
of
me
scarce
repaid
him
i
wish
to
enter
if
you
please
i
said
i
am
come
to
see
le
duc
you
he
ejaculated
his
eye
wandering
over
my
attire
which
none
of
the
newest
showed
signs
of
my
journey
yes
i
i
answered
in
some
resentment
i
am
one
of
his
men
he
looked
me
up
and
down
with
a
grin
oh
one
of
his
men
well
my
man
you
must
know
le
duc
is
not
receiving
i
am
félix
broux
i
told
him
you
may
be
félix
anybody
for
all
it
avails
you
can
not
see
monsieur
then
i
will
see
vigo
vigo
was
monsieur
master
of
horse
the
staunchest
man
in
france
this
sentry
was
nobody
just
a
common
fellow
picked
up
since
monsieur
left
quentin
but
vigo
had
been
at
his
side
these
twenty
years
vigo
say
you
vigo
does
not
see
street
boys
i
am
no
street
boy
i
cried
angrily
i
know
vigo
well
you
shall
smart
for
flouting
me
when
i
have
monsieur
ear
aye
when
you
have
be
off
with
you
rascal
i
have
no
time
to
bother
with
you
imbecile
i
sputtered
but
he
had
turned
his
back
on
me
and
resumed
his
pacing
up
and
down
the
court
oh
very
well
for
you
monsieur
i
cried
out
loudly
hoping
he
could
hear
me
but
you
will
laugh
side
of
your
mouth
by
and
by
pay
you
off
it
was
maddening
to
be
halted
like
this
at
the
door
of
my
goal
it
made
a
fool
of
me
but
while
i
debated
whether
to
set
up
an
outcry
that
would
bring
forward
some
officer
with
more
sense
than
the
surly
sentry
or
whether
to
seek
some
other
entrance
i
became
aware
of
a
sudden
bustle
in
the
courtyard
a
narrow
slice
of
which
i
could
see
through
the
gateway
a
page
dashed
across
then
a
pair
of
flunkeys
passed
there
was
some
noise
of
voices
and
finally
of
hoofs
and
wheels
half
a
dozen
ran
to
the
gates
and
swung
them
open
taking
their
stand
on
each
side
clearly
le
duc
was
about
to
drive
out
a
little
knot
of
people
had
quickly
collected
sprung
from
between
the
stones
of
the
pavement
it
would
seem
to
see
monsieur
emerge
he
is
a
bold
man
i
heard
one
say
and
a
woman
answer
aye
and
a
handsome
ere
the
heavy
coach
rolled
out
of
the
arch
i
pushed
myself
in
close
to
the
guardsmen
my
heart
thumping
in
my
throat
now
that
the
moment
had
come
when
i
should
see
my
monsieur
at
the
sight
of
his
face
i
sprang
bodily
up
on
the
crying
all
my
soul
in
my
voice
oh
monsieur
le
duc
monsieur
looked
at
me
coldly
blankly
without
a
hint
of
recognition
the
next
instant
the
young
gentleman
beside
him
sprang
struck
me
a
blow
that
hurled
me
off
the
step
i
fell
where
the
ponderous
wheels
would
have
ended
me
had
not
a
guardsman
quick
and
kind
pulled
me
out
of
the
way
some
one
shouted
assassin
i
am
no
assassin
i
cried
i
only
sought
to
speak
with
monsieur
he
deserves
a
hiding
the
young
cur
growled
my
foe
the
sentry
he
been
pestering
me
this
to
let
him
in
he
was
one
of
monsieur
men
he
said
monsieur
would
see
him
well
we
have
seen
how
monsieur
treats
him
faith
no
said
another
we
have
only
seen
how
our
young
gentleman
treats
him
of
course
he
is
too
proud
and
dainty
to
let
a
common
man
so
much
as
look
at
him
they
all
laughed
the
young
gentleman
seemed
no
favourite
parbleu
that
was
why
i
drew
him
from
the
wheels
because
knocked
him
there
said
my
preserver
i
do
believe
there
harm
in
the
boy
what
meant
you
lad
i
meant
no
harm
i
said
and
turned
sullenly
off
up
the
street
this
then
was
what
i
had
come
to
paris
for
to
be
denied
entrance
to
the
house
thrown
under
the
and
threatened
with
a
drubbing
from
the
lackeys
for
three
years
my
only
thought
had
been
to
serve
monsieur
from
waking
in
the
morning
to
sleep
at
night
my
whole
life
was
monsieur
never
was
duty
more
cheerfully
paid
never
did
acolyte
more
throw
his
soul
into
his
service
than
i
into
mine
never
did
lover
hate
to
be
parted
from
his
mistress
more
than
i
from
monsieur
the
journey
to
paris
had
been
a
journey
to
paradise
and
now
this
monsieur
had
looked
me
in
the
face
and
not
smiled
had
heard
me
beseech
him
and
not
answered
not
lifted
a
finger
to
save
me
from
being
mangled
under
his
very
eyes
quentin
and
paris
were
two
very
different
places
it
appeared
at
quentin
monsieur
had
been
pleased
to
take
me
into
the
château
and
treat
me
to
more
intimacy
than
he
accorded
to
the
lads
his
other
pages
so
much
the
easier
then
to
cast
me
off
when
he
had
tired
of
me
my
heart
seethed
with
rage
and
bitterness
against
monsieur
against
the
sentry
and
more
than
all
against
the
young
comte
de
mar
who
had
flung
me
under
the
wheels
i
had
never
before
seen
the
comte
de
mar
that
spoiled
only
son
of
le
duc
who
was
too
fine
for
the
country
too
gay
to
share
his
exile
maybe
i
was
jealous
of
the
love
his
father
bore
him
which
he
so
little
repaid
i
had
never
thought
to
like
him
quentin
though
he
were
and
now
that
i
saw
him
i
hated
him
his
handsome
face
looked
ugly
enough
to
me
as
he
struck
me
that
blow
i
went
along
the
paris
streets
blindly
the
din
of
my
own
thoughts
louder
than
all
the
noises
of
the
city
but
i
could
not
remain
in
this
trance
forever
and
at
length
i
woke
to
two
unpleasant
facts
first
i
had
no
idea
where
i
was
and
second
i
should
be
no
better
off
if
i
knew
never
while
there
remained
in
me
the
spirit
of
a
man
would
i
go
back
to
monsieur
never
would
i
serve
the
comte
de
mar
and
it
was
equally
obvious
that
never
so
long
as
my
father
retained
the
spirit
that
was
his
could
i
return
to
quentin
with
the
account
of
my
achievements
it
was
just
here
that
looking
at
the
business
with
my
father
eyes
i
began
to
have
a
suspicion
that
i
had
behaved
like
an
insolent
young
fool
but
i
was
still
too
angry
to
acknowledge
it
remained
then
but
one
course
to
stay
in
paris
and
keep
from
starvation
as
best
i
might
my
thrifty
father
had
not
seen
fit
to
furnish
me
any
money
to
throw
away
in
the
follies
of
the
town
he
had
calculated
closely
what
i
should
need
to
take
me
to
monsieur
with
a
little
margin
for
accidents
so
that
after
paying
maître
jacques
i
had
hardly
two
pieces
to
jingle
together
for
three
years
i
had
browsed
my
fill
in
the
duke
library
i
could
write
a
decent
letter
both
in
my
own
tongue
and
in
italian
thanks
to
father
francesco
monsieur
florentine
confessor
and
handle
a
sword
none
so
badly
thanks
to
monsieur
and
i
felt
that
it
should
not
be
hard
to
pick
up
a
livelihood
but
how
to
start
about
it
i
had
no
notion
and
finally
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
and
consult
him
whom
i
now
called
my
one
friend
in
paris
jacques
the
innkeeper
was
easier
said
than
done
i
had
strayed
out
of
the
friendly
rue
denis
into
a
network
of
dark
and
narrow
ways
that
might
have
been
laid
out
by
a
wily
old
stag
with
the
dogs
hot
on
him
so
did
they
twist
and
turn
and
double
on
themselves
i
could
make
my
way
only
at
a
pace
asking
new
guidance
at
every
corner
noon
was
long
past
when
at
length
i
came
on
laggard
feet
around
the
corner
by
the
amour
de
dieu
yet
was
it
not
fatigue
that
weighted
my
feet
but
pride
though
i
had
resolved
to
seek
out
maître
jacques
still
was
a
hateful
thing
to
enter
as
suppliant
where
i
had
been
the
patron
i
had
paid
for
my
breakfast
like
a
lord
but
i
should
have
to
beg
for
my
dinner
i
had
bragged
of
monsieur
fondness
and
i
should
have
to
tell
how
i
had
been
flung
under
the
my
pace
slackened
to
a
stop
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
enter
the
door
i
tried
to
think
how
to
better
my
story
so
to
tell
it
that
it
should
redound
to
my
credit
but
my
invention
stuck
in
my
pate
as
i
stood
striving
to
summon
up
a
jaunty
demeanour
i
found
myself
gazing
straight
at
the
shuttered
house
and
of
a
sudden
my
thoughts
shifted
back
to
my
vision
those
murdered
huguenots
dead
and
gone
ere
i
was
born
had
appeared
to
me
as
plain
as
the
men
i
passed
in
the
street
though
i
had
beheld
them
but
the
space
of
a
i
could
call
up
their
faces
like
those
of
my
comrades
one
the
nearest
me
was
small
pale
with
pinched
sharp
face
somewhat
the
second
man
was
conspicuously
big
and
burly
the
third
and
youngest
all
three
were
young
stood
with
his
hand
on
blackbeard
shoulder
he
too
was
tall
but
slenderly
built
with
visage
and
fair
hair
gleaming
in
the
glare
one
moment
i
saw
them
every
feature
plain
the
next
they
had
vanished
like
a
dream
it
was
an
unholy
thing
no
doubt
yet
it
held
me
with
a
shuddery
fascination
was
it
indeed
a
portent
this
rising
of
heretics
from
their
unblessed
graves
and
why
had
it
been
shown
to
me
true
son
of
the
church
had
any
one
else
ever
seen
what
i
had
seen
maître
jacques
had
hinted
at
further
terrors
and
said
no
one
dared
enter
the
place
well
grant
me
but
the
opportunity
and
i
would
dare
thus
was
hatched
in
my
brain
the
notion
of
forcing
an
entrance
into
that
banned
house
i
was
an
idle
boy
and
free
to
do
whatever
mad
mischief
presented
itself
here
was
the
house
just
across
the
street
neglected
as
it
was
it
remained
the
most
pretentious
edifice
in
the
row
being
large
and
flaunting
a
coat
of
arms
over
the
door
such
a
house
might
well
boast
two
entrances
i
hoped
it
did
for
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
batter
down
this
door
with
the
eye
of
the
rue
coupejarrets
upon
me
i
turned
along
the
side
street
and
after
exploring
several
alleys
found
one
that
led
me
into
a
small
square
court
bounded
on
three
sides
by
a
tall
house
with
shuttered
windows
fortune
was
favouring
me
but
how
to
gain
entrance
the
two
doors
were
both
firmly
fastened
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
were
small
high
and
above
one
or
two
shutters
swung
half
open
but
i
could
not
climb
the
smooth
wall
yet
i
did
not
despair
i
was
not
without
experience
of
shutters
i
selected
one
closed
not
quite
tight
leaving
a
crack
for
my
i
found
the
hook
inside
got
my
dagger
under
it
and
at
length
drove
it
up
the
shutter
creaked
shrilly
open
a
few
good
blows
knocked
in
the
casement
i
followed
i
found
myself
in
a
small
room
bare
of
everything
but
dust
from
this
once
a
porter
room
i
fancied
i
passed
out
into
a
hallway
dimly
lighted
from
the
open
window
behind
me
the
hall
was
large
paved
with
black
and
white
marbles
at
the
end
a
stately
stairway
mounted
into
mysterious
gloom
my
heart
jumped
into
my
mouth
and
i
cringed
back
in
terror
a
choked
cry
rasping
my
throat
for
as
i
crossed
the
hall
peering
into
the
dimness
i
descried
stationed
on
the
lowest
stair
with
upraised
bludgeon
a
man
for
a
second
i
stood
in
helpless
startlement
voiceless
motionless
waiting
for
him
to
brain
me
then
my
scream
changed
to
a
quavering
laugh
as
my
eyes
becoming
used
to
the
gloom
discovered
my
bogy
to
be
but
a
figure
carved
in
wood
holding
aloft
a
long
since
quenched
flambeau
i
blushed
with
shame
yet
i
can
not
say
that
now
i
felt
no
fear
i
thought
of
the
women
the
doomed
men
who
had
fled
at
the
sword
point
up
these
very
stairs
the
silence
seemed
to
shriek
at
me
and
i
half
thought
i
saw
eyes
peering
out
from
the
shadowed
corners
yet
for
all
that
nay
because
of
that
i
would
not
give
up
the
adventure
i
went
back
into
the
little
room
and
carefully
closed
the
shutter
lest
some
other
meddler
should
spy
my
misdeed
then
i
set
my
feet
on
the
stair
if
the
before
had
been
full
of
eery
terror
it
was
naught
to
the
blackness
now
my
hand
on
the
rail
was
damp
yet
i
mounted
steadily
up
one
flight
i
climbed
groped
in
the
hot
dark
for
the
foot
of
the
next
flight
and
went
on
suddenly
above
i
heard
a
noise
i
came
to
an
instant
halt
all
was
as
still
as
the
tomb
i
listened
not
a
breath
broke
the
silence
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
imagine
a
rat
in
this
house
of
the
dead
and
the
noise
shook
me
with
a
sick
feeling
about
my
heart
i
went
on
again
on
the
next
floor
it
was
lighter
faint
outlines
of
doors
and
passages
were
visible
i
could
not
stand
the
gloom
a
moment
longer
i
strode
into
the
nearest
doorway
and
across
the
room
to
where
a
gleam
of
brightness
outlined
the
window
my
shaking
fingers
found
the
hook
of
the
shutter
and
flung
it
wide
letting
in
a
burst
of
honest
sunshine
i
leaned
out
into
the
free
air
and
saw
below
me
the
rue
coupejarrets
and
the
sign
of
the
amour
de
dieu
the
next
instant
a
cloth
fell
over
my
face
and
was
twisted
tight
strong
arms
pulled
me
back
and
a
deep
voice
commanded
close
the
shutter
some
one
pushed
past
me
and
shut
it
with
a
clang
devil
take
you
you
rouse
the
quarter
cried
my
captor
fiercely
yet
not
loud
go
join
monsieur
with
that
he
picked
me
up
in
his
arms
and
walked
across
the
room
the
capture
had
been
so
quick
i
had
no
time
for
outcry
i
fought
my
best
with
him
half
strangled
as
i
was
by
the
cloth
i
might
as
well
have
struggled
against
the
grip
of
the
maiden
the
man
carried
me
the
length
of
the
house
it
seemed
flung
me
down
upon
the
floor
and
banged
a
door
on
me
iv
three
men
in
the
i
tore
the
cloth
from
my
head
and
sprang
up
i
was
in
i
dashed
against
the
door
to
no
avail
feeling
the
walls
i
discovered
myself
to
be
in
a
small
empty
closet
with
all
my
force
i
flung
myself
once
more
upon
the
door
it
stood
firm
dame
but
i
have
got
into
a
pickle
i
thought
they
were
no
ghosts
at
all
events
scared
as
i
was
i
rejoiced
at
that
i
could
cope
with
men
but
who
can
cope
with
the
devil
these
might
be
villains
doubtless
were
skulking
in
this
deserted
house
yet
with
readiness
and
pluck
i
could
escape
them
it
was
as
hot
as
a
furnace
in
my
prison
and
as
still
as
the
grave
the
men
who
seemed
by
their
footsteps
to
be
several
had
gone
cautiously
down
the
stairs
after
caging
me
evidently
i
had
given
them
a
fine
fright
clattering
through
the
house
as
i
had
and
even
now
they
were
looking
for
my
accomplices
it
seemed
hours
before
the
faintest
sound
broke
the
stillness
if
ever
you
want
to
squeeze
away
a
man
cheerfulness
like
water
from
a
rag
shut
him
up
alone
in
the
dark
and
silence
he
will
thank
you
to
take
him
out
into
the
daylight
and
hang
him
in
token
whereof
my
heart
welcomed
like
brothers
the
men
returning
they
came
into
the
room
and
i
thought
they
were
three
in
number
i
heard
the
door
shut
and
then
steps
approached
my
closet
have
a
care
now
monsieur
he
may
be
armed
spoke
the
rough
voice
of
a
man
without
breeding
doubtless
he
carries
a
culverin
up
his
sleeve
sneered
the
deep
tones
of
my
captor
some
one
else
laughed
and
rejoined
in
a
clear
quick
voice
natheless
he
may
have
a
knife
i
will
open
the
door
and
do
you
look
out
for
him
gervais
i
had
a
knife
and
had
it
in
my
hand
ready
to
charge
for
freedom
but
the
door
opened
slowly
and
gervais
looked
out
for
me
to
the
effect
that
my
knife
went
one
way
and
i
another
before
i
could
wink
i
reeled
against
the
wall
and
stayed
there
cursing
myself
for
a
fool
that
i
had
not
trusted
to
fair
words
instead
of
to
my
dagger
well
done
my
brave
gervais
cried
he
of
the
vivid
voice
a
tall
youth
whom
i
had
seen
before
so
had
i
seen
the
stalwart
blackbeard
gervais
the
third
man
was
older
a
fellow
whose
face
was
new
to
me
all
three
were
in
their
shirts
on
account
of
the
heat
all
were
plain
even
shabby
in
their
dress
but
the
two
young
men
wore
swords
at
their
sides
the
shutters
overhanging
the
court
let
plenty
of
light
into
the
room
it
had
two
straw
beds
on
the
floor
and
a
few
old
chairs
and
stools
and
a
table
covered
with
dishes
and
broken
food
and
more
bottles
whips
and
spurs
two
or
three
hats
and
and
various
odds
and
ends
of
dress
littered
the
floor
and
the
chairs
everything
was
of
mean
quality
except
the
bearing
of
the
two
young
men
a
gentleman
is
a
gentleman
even
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
all
the
more
maybe
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
these
two
were
gently
born
the
low
man
with
scared
face
held
off
from
me
he
whose
name
was
gervais
confronted
me
with
an
angry
scowl
alone
for
so
i
dubbed
the
third
from
his
gray
eyes
well
open
under
dark
brows
looked
no
whit
alarmed
or
angered
the
only
emotion
to
be
read
in
his
face
was
a
gay
interest
as
the
blackavised
gervais
put
me
questions
how
came
you
here
what
are
you
about
no
harm
messieurs
i
made
haste
to
protest
ruing
my
stupidity
with
that
dagger
i
climbed
in
at
a
window
for
sport
i
thought
the
house
was
deserted
he
clutched
my
shoulder
till
i
could
have
screamed
for
pain
the
truth
now
if
you
value
your
life
you
will
tell
the
truth
monsieur
it
is
the
truth
i
came
in
idle
mischief
that
was
the
whole
of
it
i
had
no
notion
of
breaking
in
upon
you
or
any
one
they
said
the
house
was
haunted
who
said
that
maître
jacques
at
the
amour
de
dieu
he
stared
at
me
in
surprise
what
had
you
been
asking
about
this
house
lounging
against
the
table
struck
in
i
can
tell
you
that
myself
he
told
jacques
he
saw
us
in
the
window
last
night
did
you
not
aye
monsieur
the
thunder
woke
me
and
when
i
looked
out
i
saw
you
plain
as
day
but
maître
jacques
said
it
was
a
vision
i
flattered
myself
i
saw
you
first
and
got
that
shutter
closed
very
neatly
said
dame
i
am
not
so
clever
as
i
thought
so
old
jacques
called
us
ghosts
did
he
yes
monsieur
he
told
me
this
house
belonged
to
de
béthune
who
was
a
huguenot
and
killed
in
the
massacre
burst
into
joyous
laughter
he
said
my
house
belonged
to
the
béthunes
well
played
jacques
you
owe
that
gallant
lie
to
me
gervais
and
the
pains
i
took
to
make
him
think
us
navarre
men
he
is
heart
and
soul
for
henri
quatre
did
he
say
perchance
that
in
this
very
courtyard
coligny
fell
no
said
i
seeing
that
i
had
been
fooled
and
had
had
all
my
terrors
for
naught
and
feeling
much
chagrined
thereat
how
was
i
to
know
it
was
a
lie
i
know
naught
about
paris
i
came
up
but
yesterday
from
st
quentin
st
quentin
came
a
cry
from
the
henchman
with
a
fierce
be
quiet
fool
gervais
turned
to
me
and
demanded
my
name
félix
broux
who
sent
you
here
monsieur
no
one
you
lie
again
he
gripped
me
by
the
shoulder
gripped
till
the
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
no
one
monsieur
i
swear
it
you
will
not
speak
i
make
you
by
heaven
he
seized
my
thumb
and
wrist
to
bend
one
back
on
the
other
torture
with
strength
such
as
his
sprang
off
the
table
let
alone
gervais
the
boy
honest
he
is
a
spy
he
is
a
fool
of
a
country
boy
a
spy
in
hobnailed
shoes
forsooth
no
spy
ever
behaved
as
he
has
i
said
when
you
first
seized
him
he
was
no
spy
i
say
it
again
now
i
have
heard
his
story
he
saw
us
by
chance
and
maître
jacques
bogy
story
spurred
him
on
instead
of
keeping
him
off
you
are
a
fool
my
cousin
pardieu
it
is
you
who
are
the
fool
growled
gervais
you
will
bring
us
to
the
rope
with
your
cursed
easy
ways
if
he
is
a
spy
it
means
the
whole
crew
are
down
upon
us
what
of
that
pardieu
is
it
nothing
returned
with
a
touch
of
haughtiness
it
is
nothing
a
gentleman
may
live
in
his
own
house
gervais
looked
as
if
he
remembered
something
he
said
much
less
boisterously
and
do
you
want
monsieur
here
flushed
red
no
he
cried
but
you
may
be
easy
he
will
not
trouble
himself
to
come
gervais
regarded
him
silently
an
instant
as
if
he
thought
of
several
things
he
did
not
say
what
he
did
say
was
you
are
a
pair
of
fools
you
and
the
boy
whatever
he
came
for
he
has
spied
on
us
now
he
shall
not
live
to
carry
the
tale
of
us
then
you
have
me
to
kill
as
well
gervais
turned
on
him
snarling
laid
a
hand
on
his
i
will
not
have
an
innocent
lad
hurt
i
was
not
bred
a
ruffian
he
cried
hotly
they
glared
at
each
other
then
with
a
sudden
exclamation
ah
bah
gervais
broke
into
laughter
now
this
merriment
was
a
thing
to
hear
for
gervais
was
taking
the
situation
with
a
seriousness
that
was
as
terrifying
as
it
was
stupid
when
i
looked
into
his
dogged
eyes
i
could
not
but
think
the
end
of
me
might
be
near
but
laugh
said
the
very
notion
was
ridiculous
i
was
innocent
of
all
harmful
intent
and
they
were
gentlemen
not
cutthroats
messieurs
i
said
i
swear
by
the
blessed
saints
i
am
what
i
told
you
i
am
no
spy
and
no
one
sent
me
here
who
you
are
or
what
you
do
i
know
no
more
than
a
babe
unborn
i
belong
to
no
party
and
am
no
man
as
for
why
you
choose
to
live
in
this
empty
house
it
is
not
my
concern
and
i
care
no
whit
about
it
let
me
go
messieurs
and
i
will
swear
to
keep
silence
about
what
i
have
seen
i
am
for
letting
him
go
said
gervais
looked
doubtful
the
most
encouraging
attitude
toward
me
he
had
yet
assumed
he
answered
if
he
had
not
said
the
name
stuff
interrupted
it
is
a
coincidence
no
more
if
he
were
what
you
think
it
is
the
very
last
name
he
would
have
said
this
was
greek
to
me
i
had
mentioned
no
names
but
maître
jacques
and
my
own
and
he
was
their
friend
messieurs
i
said
if
it
is
my
name
that
does
not
please
you
why
i
can
say
for
it
that
if
it
is
not
very
at
least
it
is
an
honest
one
and
has
ever
been
held
so
down
where
we
live
and
that
is
at
quentin
said
yes
monsieur
my
father
anton
broux
is
master
of
the
forest
to
the
duke
of
st
quentin
he
started
and
gervais
cried
out
voilà
who
is
the
fool
now
my
nerves
which
had
grown
tranquil
since
came
to
my
rescue
quivered
anew
the
common
man
started
at
the
very
word
quentin
and
the
masters
started
when
i
named
the
duke
was
it
he
whom
they
had
spoken
of
as
monsieur
who
and
what
were
they
there
was
more
in
this
than
i
had
thought
at
first
it
was
no
longer
a
mere
question
of
my
liberty
i
was
all
eyes
and
ears
for
whatever
information
i
could
gather
spoke
to
me
for
the
first
time
gravely
this
is
not
a
time
when
folks
take
to
paris
what
brought
you
i
used
to
be
monsieur
page
down
at
quentin
i
answered
deeming
the
straight
truth
best
when
we
learned
that
he
was
in
paris
my
father
sent
me
up
to
him
i
reached
the
city
last
night
and
lay
at
the
amour
de
dieu
this
morning
i
went
to
the
duke
hôtel
but
the
guard
would
not
let
me
in
then
when
monsieur
drove
out
i
tried
to
get
speech
with
him
but
he
would
have
none
of
me
the
bitterness
i
felt
over
my
rebuff
must
have
been
in
my
voice
and
face
for
gervais
spoke
abruptly
and
do
you
hate
him
for
that
nay
said
i
churlishly
enough
it
is
his
to
do
as
he
chooses
but
i
hate
the
comte
de
mar
for
striking
me
a
foul
blow
the
comte
de
mar
exclaimed
his
son
he
has
no
son
but
he
has
monsieur
the
comte
de
he
is
dead
said
why
we
knew
naught
i
was
beginning
when
gervais
broke
in
you
say
the
fellow
honest
when
he
tells
such
tales
as
this
he
saw
the
comte
de
mar
i
thought
it
must
be
he
i
protested
a
young
man
who
sat
by
monsieur
side
elegant
and
with
an
aquiline
face
that
is
lucas
that
is
his
secretary
declared
as
who
should
say
that
is
his
scullion
gervais
looked
at
him
oddly
a
moment
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
demanded
of
me
what
next
i
came
away
angry
and
walked
all
the
way
here
to
risk
your
life
in
a
haunted
house
pardieu
too
plain
a
lie
oh
i
would
have
done
the
like
we
none
of
us
fear
ghosts
in
the
daytime
said
you
may
believe
him
i
am
no
such
fool
he
has
been
caught
in
two
lies
first
the
béthunes
then
the
comte
de
mar
he
is
a
clumsy
spy
they
might
have
found
a
better
one
not
but
what
that
touch
about
at
monsieur
hand
was
well
thought
of
that
was
monsieur
suggestion
i
warrant
for
the
boy
has
talked
like
a
dolt
else
i
am
no
liar
i
cried
hotly
ask
jacques
whether
he
did
not
tell
me
about
the
béthunes
it
is
his
lie
not
mine
i
did
not
know
the
comte
de
mar
was
dead
and
this
lucas
of
yours
is
handsome
enough
for
a
count
i
came
here
as
i
told
you
in
curiosity
concerning
maître
story
i
had
no
idea
of
seeing
you
or
any
living
man
it
is
the
truth
monsieur
i
believe
you
answered
you
have
an
honest
face
you
came
into
my
house
uninvited
well
i
forgive
it
and
invite
you
to
stay
you
shall
be
my
valet
he
shall
be
nobody
valet
gervais
cried
the
gray
eyes
flashed
but
their
owner
rejoined
lightly
you
have
a
man
surely
i
should
have
one
too
and
i
understand
the
services
of
félix
are
not
engaged
mille
tonnerres
you
would
take
this
spy
this
sneak
as
i
would
take
de
paris
if
i
chose
responded
with
a
cold
hauteur
that
smacked
more
of
a
court
than
of
this
shabby
room
he
added
lightly
again
you
think
him
a
spy
i
do
not
but
in
any
case
he
must
not
blab
of
us
therefore
he
stays
here
and
brushes
my
clothes
marry
they
need
it
easily
with
grace
he
had
disposed
of
the
matter
but
i
said
monsieur
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
what
he
cried
as
if
the
itself
had
risen
in
rebellion
what
you
will
not
no
said
i
and
why
not
he
demanded
plainly
thinking
me
demented
because
i
know
you
are
against
the
duke
of
st
quentin
whatever
they
had
thought
me
neither
expected
that
speech
i
am
no
spy
or
sneak
said
i
it
is
true
i
came
here
by
chance
it
is
true
monsieur
turned
me
off
this
morning
but
i
was
born
on
his
land
and
i
am
no
traitor
i
will
not
be
valet
or
henchman
for
either
of
you
if
i
die
for
it
i
was
like
to
die
for
it
for
gervais
whipped
out
his
sword
and
sprang
for
me
i
thought
i
saw
out
too
when
gervais
struck
me
over
the
head
with
his
the
rest
was
darkness
v
and
a
i
came
to
my
senses
slowly
to
hear
loud
angry
voices
as
i
opened
my
eyes
and
stirred
the
room
reeled
from
me
and
all
was
blank
again
awhile
after
i
grew
aware
of
a
clashing
of
steel
i
lay
wondering
thickly
what
it
was
and
why
it
had
to
be
going
on
while
my
head
ached
so
till
at
length
it
dawned
on
my
dull
brain
that
swords
were
crossing
i
opened
my
eyes
again
then
they
were
fighting
each
other
and
gervais
the
latter
was
almost
trampling
on
me
had
pressed
him
so
close
to
the
wall
then
he
forced
his
way
out
and
they
drove
each
other
round
in
a
circle
till
the
room
seemed
to
spin
once
more
i
crawled
out
of
the
way
and
watched
them
bewildered
absorbed
i
had
more
reason
to
thrill
over
the
contest
than
the
mere
excellence
of
it
which
was
great
since
i
was
the
cause
of
the
duel
and
my
very
life
belike
hung
on
its
issue
they
were
both
admirable
swordsmen
yet
it
was
clear
from
the
first
where
the
palm
lay
anything
nimbler
lighter
easier
than
the
of
i
never
hope
to
see
in
this
imperfect
world
the
heavier
adversary
was
hot
angry
breathing
hard
a
smile
hovered
over
lips
already
a
red
disk
on
gervais
shirt
showed
where
his
cousin
sword
had
been
and
would
soon
go
again
and
deeper
i
had
forgotten
my
bruise
in
my
interest
and
delight
when
of
a
sudden
one
whom
we
all
had
ignored
took
a
hand
in
the
game
gervais
lackey
started
forward
and
knocked
up
arm
his
sword
flew
wide
and
gervais
slashed
his
arm
from
wrist
to
elbow
with
a
smothered
cry
caught
at
his
wound
gervais
ablaze
with
rage
sprang
past
him
on
his
creature
the
man
gaped
with
amazement
then
for
there
was
no
time
for
parley
leaped
for
the
door
it
was
locked
he
turned
and
with
a
look
of
deathly
terror
fell
on
his
knees
crouched
up
against
the
gervais
lunged
his
blade
passed
clean
through
the
man
shoulders
and
pinned
him
to
the
door
his
head
fell
heavily
forward
have
you
killed
him
cried
by
my
faith
i
meant
to
came
the
answer
gervais
was
bending
over
the
man
with
an
abrupt
laugh
he
called
out
killed
him
pardieu
he
has
come
off
cheap
he
raised
the
fellow
limp
head
and
we
saw
that
the
sword
had
passed
just
over
his
shoulder
piercing
the
linen
not
the
flesh
he
had
swooned
from
sheer
terror
being
in
truth
not
so
much
as
scratched
gervais
turned
to
his
cousin
i
never
meant
that
foul
trick
it
was
no
thought
of
mine
i
would
have
turned
the
blade
if
i
could
i
will
kill
pontou
now
if
you
say
the
word
nay
answered
the
other
faintly
help
me
the
blood
was
pouring
from
his
arm
he
was
half
swooning
gervais
and
i
ran
to
him
and
between
us
bathed
the
cut
bandaged
it
with
strips
torn
from
a
shirt
and
made
a
sling
of
a
scarf
the
wound
was
long
but
not
deep
and
when
we
had
poured
some
wine
down
his
throat
he
was
himself
again
you
will
not
bear
me
malice
for
that
poltroon
work
étienne
gervais
asked
more
humbly
than
i
ever
thought
to
hear
him
speak
that
was
a
foul
cut
but
it
was
no
fault
of
mine
i
am
no
blackguard
i
fight
fair
i
will
kill
the
knave
if
you
like
you
are
ungrateful
gervais
he
saved
you
when
you
needed
saving
laughed
faith
let
him
live
i
forgive
him
you
will
pay
me
for
my
hurt
by
yielding
me
félix
gervais
looked
at
me
while
we
had
worked
side
by
side
over
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
he
was
my
enemy
but
now
all
the
old
suspicion
and
dislike
came
into
his
face
again
however
he
answered
aye
you
would
have
been
the
victor
had
it
not
been
for
pontou
you
shall
do
what
you
like
with
your
boy
i
promise
you
that
now
that
is
well
said
gervais
returned
rising
and
picking
up
his
sword
which
he
sheathed
that
is
very
well
said
for
if
you
did
not
feel
like
promising
it
why
i
should
have
to
begin
over
again
with
my
left
hand
oh
i
give
you
the
boy
gervais
repeated
rather
sullenly
turning
away
to
pour
himself
some
wine
i
could
not
but
wonder
at
at
his
gaiety
and
his
steadfastness
he
had
hardly
looked
grave
through
the
whole
affair
he
had
fought
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
and
had
taken
a
cruel
wound
with
a
laugh
withal
he
had
been
the
constant
champion
of
my
innocence
even
to
drawing
his
sword
on
his
cousin
for
me
now
with
his
bloody
arm
in
its
sling
he
was
as
debonair
and
careless
as
ever
i
had
been
stupid
enough
to
imagine
the
big
gervais
the
leader
of
the
two
and
i
found
myself
mistaken
i
dropped
on
my
knee
and
kissed
my
saviour
hand
in
all
gratitude
aha
said
what
think
you
now
of
being
my
valet
verily
i
was
hard
pushed
monsieur
i
said
i
owe
you
much
more
than
i
can
ever
pay
if
you
were
any
man
enemy
but
my
duke
i
would
serve
you
on
my
knees
but
i
was
born
on
the
duke
land
and
i
can
not
be
disloyal
you
may
kill
me
yourself
if
you
like
no
he
answered
gravely
that
is
not
my
métier
gervais
laughed
make
me
that
offer
and
i
accept
turned
to
him
with
that
little
hauteur
he
assumed
occasionally
you
are
helpless
my
cousin
you
have
passed
your
word
aye
i
leave
him
to
you
his
sullen
eyes
told
me
it
was
no
tenderness
for
me
that
prompted
his
surrender
nor
had
i
truth
to
tell
any
great
faith
in
the
sacredness
of
his
word
yet
i
believed
he
would
let
me
be
for
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
despite
his
passion
and
temper
he
had
no
wish
to
quarrel
with
whether
at
bottom
he
loved
him
or
in
some
way
dreaded
him
i
could
not
tell
but
of
this
my
wits
were
sure
he
had
no
desire
to
press
an
open
breach
he
was
honestly
ashamed
of
his
henchman
low
deed
yet
even
before
that
his
judgment
had
disliked
the
quarrel
else
why
had
he
struck
me
with
the
hilt
of
the
sword
i
leave
him
to
you
he
repeated
do
as
you
choose
if
you
deem
his
life
a
precious
thing
cherish
it
when
did
you
learn
a
taste
for
insolence
étienne
time
was
when
you
were
touchy
on
that
score
time
never
was
when
i
did
not
love
courage
oh
it
is
courage
with
a
sneer
he
turned
away
gervais
said
have
the
kindness
to
unlock
the
door
gervais
wheeled
around
his
face
an
angry
question
answered
it
with
cold
politeness
that
félix
broux
may
pass
out
by
heaven
he
shall
not
you
gave
your
word
you
would
leave
him
to
me
did
you
lie
i
do
leave
him
to
you
gervais
thundered
i
would
slit
his
impudent
throat
but
since
you
love
him
you
may
have
him
to
eat
out
of
your
plate
and
sleep
in
your
bosom
i
will
put
up
with
it
but
go
out
of
that
door
till
the
thing
is
done
sang
dieu
he
shall
not
if
he
goes
straight
to
the
duke
what
then
he
will
say
he
found
us
living
in
my
house
what
harm
we
are
no
felons
let
him
say
it
and
put
lucas
on
his
guard
returned
gervais
he
was
angry
yet
he
spoke
with
evident
attempt
at
restraint
put
lucas
on
the
trail
he
is
wary
as
a
cat
let
him
get
wind
of
us
here
and
he
will
never
let
us
catch
him
well
said
reluctantly
it
is
true
and
though
i
will
not
have
the
boy
harmed
he
shall
stay
here
i
will
not
put
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
we
will
take
no
risks
till
lucas
is
shent
the
boy
shall
be
held
prisoner
and
afterward
i
will
come
myself
and
let
him
out
said
gervais
and
laughed
i
glanced
at
my
protector
not
liking
to
think
of
that
moment
whenever
it
might
be
afterward
he
went
up
to
gervais
my
cousin
are
we
friends
or
foes
for
faith
you
treat
me
strangely
like
a
foe
we
are
friends
i
am
your
friend
since
it
is
in
your
cause
that
i
am
here
i
have
stood
at
your
shoulder
like
a
brother
you
can
not
deny
it
no
gervais
answered
you
stood
my
friend
my
one
friend
in
that
house
as
i
was
yours
i
stood
at
your
shoulder
in
the
montluc
affair
you
can
not
deny
that
i
have
been
your
ally
your
servant
your
messenger
to
mademoiselle
your
envoy
to
mayenne
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
win
you
your
lady
a
shadow
fell
over
open
face
that
task
needs
a
greater
power
than
yours
my
gervais
he
regarded
gervais
with
a
rueful
smile
his
thoughts
of
a
sudden
as
far
away
from
me
as
if
i
had
never
set
foot
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
he
shook
his
head
sighing
and
said
with
a
hand
on
gervais
shoulder
it
beyond
you
cousin
gervais
brought
him
back
to
the
point
well
i
done
what
i
could
for
you
but
you
do
help
me
when
you
let
loose
a
spy
to
warn
lucas
he
shall
not
go
you
know
well
cousin
you
will
be
no
gladder
than
i
when
that
knave
is
dead
but
i
will
not
have
félix
broux
suffer
because
he
dared
speak
for
the
duke
of
st
quentin
as
you
choose
then
i
will
not
touch
a
hair
of
his
head
if
you
keep
him
from
lucas
once
more
he
turned
away
across
the
room
my
bewilderment
was
so
great
that
the
words
came
out
of
themselves
messieurs
is
it
lucas
you
mean
to
kill
looked
at
me
not
instantly
replying
i
cried
again
to
him
monsieur
is
it
lucas
or
the
duke
then
despite
a
gesture
from
gervais
who
would
have
told
me
nothing
i
might
ask
exclaimed
why
lucas
he
said
it
in
such
honest
surprise
and
with
such
a
steady
glance
that
the
heavy
fear
that
had
hung
on
me
dropped
from
me
like
a
and
suddenly
i
turned
quite
dizzy
and
fell
into
the
nearest
chair
a
dash
of
water
in
the
face
made
me
look
up
to
see
standing
by
me
mon
dieu
he
cried
you
were
as
white
as
the
wall
do
you
love
so
much
this
lucas
who
struck
you
no
i
said
rising
i
thought
you
meant
to
kill
the
duke
did
you
take
us
for
leaguers
i
nodded
he
spoke
as
if
actually
he
felt
it
important
to
set
himself
right
in
my
eyes
well
we
are
none
we
are
no
politicians
but
private
gentlemen
with
a
grudge
to
pay
i
care
not
what
the
parties
do
whether
we
have
the
princess
isabelle
or
henry
the
huguenot
is
all
one
to
me
i
am
not
putting
either
on
the
throne
so
if
you
have
got
it
into
your
head
that
we
are
plotting
for
the
league
why
get
it
out
again
but
you
are
enemies
to
the
duke
of
st
quentin
he
answered
me
slowly
we
do
not
love
him
but
we
do
not
plot
his
death
he
goes
his
way
unharmed
by
us
we
are
gentlemen
not
bravos
and
lucas
lucas
is
my
cousin
enemy
and
being
a
great
man
man
skulks
behind
the
bars
of
the
hôtel
quentin
and
will
not
face
my
cousin
sword
so
to
reach
him
takes
a
little
plotting
do
you
believe
me
i
looked
into
his
gray
eyes
that
had
flashed
so
hotly
in
my
defence
and
i
could
not
but
believe
him
yes
monsieur
i
said
he
regarded
me
curiously
the
duke
life
seems
much
to
you
why
monsieur
i
am
a
broux
and
could
not
be
disloyal
to
save
your
life
my
life
monsieur
the
broux
would
not
seek
to
save
their
souls
if
le
duc
preferred
them
damned
i
expected
he
would
rebuke
me
for
the
outburst
but
he
did
not
he
merely
said
and
lucas
oh
lucas
i
said
i
know
nothing
of
him
he
is
new
with
the
duke
since
my
time
i
do
not
owe
him
anything
save
a
grudge
for
that
blow
this
morning
mon
dieu
monsieur
i
am
thankful
to
you
for
befriending
me
dying
for
monsieur
is
all
in
a
day
work
we
expect
to
do
that
but
my
faith
if
i
had
died
just
now
it
would
have
been
for
lucas
at
this
moment
a
long
groan
came
from
the
end
of
the
room
we
turned
the
lackey
was
waking
from
his
swoon
under
the
ministration
of
gervais
he
opened
his
eyes
their
glance
was
dull
till
they
fell
upon
his
master
and
then
at
once
they
looked
venomous
gervais
kicked
him
into
fuller
consciousness
get
up
hound
it
is
time
to
meet
martin
the
wretch
scrambled
shakily
to
his
feet
and
stood
clutching
the
and
eying
gervais
terror
writ
large
on
his
chalky
countenance
yet
there
was
more
than
terror
in
his
face
there
was
the
look
you
see
in
the
eyes
of
a
trapped
animal
that
watches
its
chance
to
bite
cried
out
you
dare
not
send
that
man
gervais
why
not
because
the
moment
he
is
clear
of
the
house
he
will
betray
you
look
at
his
face
he
shall
swear
on
the
cross
aye
but
you
can
not
trust
the
oath
of
such
as
he
what
would
you
we
must
send
as
you
will
but
you
are
mad
if
you
send
him
gervais
pondered
a
moment
his
slower
wits
taking
in
the
situation
then
he
seized
the
man
by
the
collar
fairly
flung
him
across
the
room
into
the
closet
and
bolted
the
door
upon
him
i
will
settle
with
him
later
but
you
are
right
we
can
not
send
him
burst
into
laughter
my
faith
we
could
not
have
more
trouble
if
we
were
heads
of
the
league
than
this
little
duel
of
yours
is
giving
us
why
what
if
we
are
seen
i
will
go
gervais
started
no
that
will
not
do
eh
bien
then
what
will
you
propose
but
it
was
some
one
else
who
proposed
i
said
to
monsieur
if
all
your
purpose
is
against
lucas
and
no
other
i
am
your
man
i
will
go
what
my
you
why
monsieur
i
owe
you
a
great
debt
while
i
thought
you
meant
ill
to
le
duc
i
could
not
serve
you
but
this
lucas
is
another
pair
of
sleeves
i
owe
him
no
allegiance
moreover
he
nearly
killed
me
this
morning
therefore
i
am
quite
at
your
disposal
now
i
wonder
if
you
are
lying
said
gervais
i
do
not
think
he
is
lying
said
i
trow
gervais
we
have
got
our
messenger
you
tell
me
to
beware
of
pontou
because
he
hates
me
and
then
would
have
me
trust
this
fellow
gervais
demanded
with
some
acumen
i
said
monsieur
you
do
not
seem
to
understand
how
i
come
to
make
this
offer
to
get
out
of
the
house
with
a
whole
skin
i
had
a
joy
in
daring
him
being
sure
of
monsieur
i
said
i
should
be
glad
to
leave
this
house
with
my
skin
whole
or
broken
so
long
as
i
left
on
my
own
feet
but
you
have
mentioned
the
very
reason
why
i
shall
not
betray
you
i
do
not
love
you
and
i
do
not
love
lucas
therefore
if
you
and
lucas
are
to
fight
i
ask
nothing
better
than
to
help
the
quarrel
on
he
stared
at
me
with
an
air
more
of
bewilderment
than
aught
else
but
ready
laughter
rang
out
bravo
félix
i
am
proud
of
you
that
is
an
idea
worthy
of
cæsar
you
would
set
your
enemies
to
exterminate
each
other
and
i
asked
you
to
be
my
valet
which
do
you
wish
to
see
slain
demanded
the
black
gervais
i
answered
quite
truthfully
monsieur
i
shall
be
pleased
either
way
i
know
not
how
he
relished
the
answer
for
cried
out
at
once
bravo
félix
you
are
a
paragon
i
have
not
wit
enough
to
know
whether
you
are
as
simple
as
sunshine
or
as
deep
as
a
well
but
i
love
you
monsieur
i
answered
as
i
think
very
neatly
if
i
am
a
well
truth
lies
at
the
bottom
well
gervais
demanded
gervais
bent
his
lowering
brows
on
his
cousin
do
you
say
trust
him
aye
i
would
trust
him
for
never
yet
did
villain
turn
honest
nor
honest
man
false
in
one
short
hour
when
he
was
asked
to
serve
against
the
duke
he
showed
his
stuff
he
was
no
traitor
he
was
no
coward
he
was
no
liar
i
think
he
is
not
those
now
gervais
was
still
doubtful
it
is
a
risk
if
he
betrays
what
is
life
without
risks
cried
i
thought
you
too
good
a
gambler
gervais
to
falter
before
a
risk
well
gervais
consented
i
leave
it
to
you
do
as
you
like
said
at
once
to
me
this
lucas
as
i
told
you
is
too
cowardly
to
meet
my
cousin
in
open
fight
since
he
got
the
challenge
he
has
never
stuck
his
nose
out
of
doors
without
two
or
three
of
the
duke
guard
about
him
therefore
we
have
the
right
to
get
at
him
as
we
can
we
have
paid
a
man
in
the
house
to
tell
of
his
movements
he
is
to
fare
out
secretly
at
night
on
a
mission
for
le
duc
with
one
comrade
only
gervais
and
i
will
interrupt
that
little
journey
very
good
monsieur
and
i
you
will
meet
our
spy
and
learn
the
hour
of
the
expedition
last
night
when
he
told
us
of
the
plan
it
had
not
been
decided
then
he
will
be
the
other
man
i
saw
in
the
window
i
shall
know
him
you
have
sharp
eyes
and
a
sharp
brain
youngster
but
he
will
not
know
you
therefore
you
can
say
you
come
from
the
shuttered
house
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
you
will
meet
him
in
the
little
alley
to
the
north
of
the
hôtel
quentin
do
you
know
your
way
to
the
hôtel
well
then
you
are
to
go
down
the
passageway
between
the
house
and
de
garden
you
can
not
mistake
it
for
on
two
sides
of
the
house
is
the
street
on
the
third
the
garden
and
on
the
fourth
the
alleyway
down
the
alley
is
an
arch
with
a
small
door
in
that
arch
our
man
louis
martin
will
meet
you
do
you
understand
i
repeated
the
directions
you
have
learned
your
lesson
you
will
ask
him
the
hour
only
that
and
you
will
take
oath
not
to
betray
us
commanded
gervais
i
took
out
the
cross
that
hung
on
my
rosary
i
was
ready
to
swear
gervais
prompted
i
swear
to
go
and
come
straight
and
speak
no
word
to
any
but
martin
with
all
solemnity
i
swore
it
on
my
cross
that
oath
will
be
kept
said
he
held
out
a
sudden
hand
for
the
cross
which
i
gave
him
wondering
i
swear
that
we
mean
no
harm
whatsoever
to
the
duke
of
st
quentin
he
kissed
the
cross
and
flung
the
chain
back
over
my
neck
at
last
i
saw
the
door
unlocked
even
returned
to
me
my
knife
au
revoir
messieurs
gervais
sullen
to
the
last
vouchsafed
no
answer
but
called
out
cheerily
au
revoir
vi
matter
of
life
and
nothing
in
life
can
be
so
sweet
as
freedom
after
captivity
safety
after
danger
when
i
gained
the
open
street
once
more
and
breathed
the
open
air
no
one
molesting
or
troubling
me
i
could
have
sung
with
joy
i
fairly
hugged
myself
for
my
cleverness
in
getting
out
of
my
plight
as
for
the
combat
i
was
furthering
my
only
doubt
about
that
was
lest
the
skulking
lucas
should
not
prove
good
sword
enough
to
give
trouble
to
gervais
it
was
very
far
from
my
wish
that
he
should
come
out
of
the
attempt
unscathed
but
as
i
went
along
and
had
more
time
to
ponder
the
matter
other
doubts
forced
themselves
into
my
reluctant
mind
put
it
as
i
pleased
the
affair
smacked
too
much
of
secrecy
to
be
quite
savoury
it
was
curious
to
say
the
least
that
an
honest
encounter
should
require
so
much
plotting
also
lucas
coward
and
rascal
though
he
might
be
was
monsieur
man
doing
monsieur
errand
and
for
me
to
mix
myself
up
in
a
plot
against
him
was
scarcely
in
keeping
with
my
vaunted
loyalty
to
the
house
of
quentin
my
friend
gervais
quarrel
might
be
just
his
manner
of
procedure
even
might
be
just
and
yet
i
have
no
right
to
take
part
in
it
and
yet
monsieur
had
signified
plainly
enough
that
he
was
no
longer
my
patron
for
my
birth
sake
i
might
never
work
against
him
but
i
was
free
to
do
whatever
else
i
chose
monsieur
himself
had
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
take
another
master
and
assuredly
i
owed
something
to
i
had
reason
to
feel
confidence
in
his
honour
surely
i
might
reckon
that
he
would
not
be
in
the
affair
unless
it
were
honest
lucas
was
like
enough
a
scoundrel
of
whom
monsieur
would
be
well
rid
and
lastly
and
finally
and
above
all
i
was
sworn
so
there
was
no
use
worrying
about
it
i
had
taken
oath
and
could
not
draw
back
i
hurried
along
to
the
rendezvous
only
pausing
one
moment
at
the
to
buy
sausages
hot
from
the
brazier
which
i
crammed
into
my
mouth
as
i
ran
but
after
all
was
there
no
need
of
haste
the
little
arch
when
i
panted
up
to
it
was
all
deserted
no
better
place
for
a
tryst
could
have
been
found
in
the
heart
of
busy
paris
only
the
one
door
opened
into
the
alley
de
portreuse
high
garden
wall
forming
the
other
side
of
the
passage
was
unbroken
by
a
gate
and
no
curious
eyes
from
the
house
could
look
into
the
deep
arch
and
see
the
narrow
door
at
the
back
where
i
awaited
the
martin
i
stood
there
long
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
fearful
every
moment
lest
some
one
of
monsieur
true
men
should
come
along
to
demand
my
business
no
one
appeared
either
foe
or
friend
for
so
long
that
i
began
to
think
had
tricked
me
and
sent
me
here
on
a
fool
errand
when
all
at
once
a
low
voice
said
close
to
my
ear
what
seek
you
here
i
jumped
on
finding
at
my
side
a
little
pale
man
the
man
of
the
vision
he
had
slipped
through
the
door
so
suddenly
and
quietly
that
i
was
once
more
tempted
to
take
him
for
a
ghost
he
eyed
me
for
a
bare
second
then
his
eyes
dropped
before
mine
i
am
come
to
learn
the
hour
said
i
did
you
not
hear
the
chimes
ring
five
oh
no
need
for
disguise
i
am
come
from
the
two
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
they
bade
me
ask
the
hour
he
favoured
me
with
another
of
his
shifty
glances
what
hour
meant
they
i
said
bluntly
in
a
louder
tone
the
hour
when
lucas
sets
out
on
his
secret
mission
hush
he
cried
hush
do
say
names
aloud
his
or
the
other
well
i
said
crossly
you
have
kept
me
waiting
already
more
time
than
i
care
to
lose
how
much
longer
before
you
will
tell
me
what
i
came
to
know
he
looked
at
me
sharply
for
another
brief
instant
before
his
eyes
slunk
away
from
mine
you
should
have
a
password
they
gave
me
none
they
told
me
to
say
i
came
from
the
shuttered
house
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
and
that
would
be
enough
how
came
you
into
this
business
by
a
back
window
he
gave
me
another
suspicious
glance
but
making
nothing
by
it
he
rejoined
eh
bien
i
trust
you
i
will
tell
you
he
clutched
my
arm
and
drew
me
to
the
back
of
the
arch
where
the
afternoon
shadows
were
already
gathered
what
have
you
for
me
he
demanded
nothing
what
should
i
have
no
gold
no
he
promised
me
ten
pistoles
he
did
not
give
them
to
you
i
tell
you
no
you
are
a
thief
you
have
them
he
stepped
forward
menacingly
so
did
i
he
then
fell
back
as
abruptly
nay
it
was
a
jest
i
know
you
are
honest
but
he
promised
me
ten
pistoles
he
did
not
give
them
to
me
i
said
perhaps
he
was
not
so
convinced
of
my
honesty
he
will
doubtless
pay
you
afterward
afterward
he
retorted
in
a
high
key
by
our
lady
he
shall
pay
me
afterward
the
gutters
will
run
gold
then
will
they
pardieu
i
will
see
that
a
good
stream
flows
my
way
but
one
can
not
play
with
coin
he
said
i
should
have
ten
pistoles
when
i
let
him
know
the
hour
i
can
not
mend
that
it
lies
between
you
and
him
i
have
not
seen
or
heard
of
any
money
martin
edged
up
close
to
the
door
of
retreat
and
waxed
defiant
then
all
i
have
to
say
is
he
may
go
whistle
for
his
news
now
had
i
but
thought
of
it
here
was
an
easy
road
out
of
a
bad
business
if
martin
would
not
tell
the
hour
of
rendezvous
lucas
was
saved
monsieur
interests
not
endangered
yet
at
the
same
time
i
was
not
forsworn
but
touch
pitch
and
be
defiled
you
can
not
go
hand
and
glove
with
villains
and
remain
an
honest
man
i
returned
directly
as
you
choose
but
gervais
carries
a
long
sword
he
started
at
that
and
made
no
instant
reply
seeming
to
be
balancing
considerations
then
he
gave
his
decision
i
will
tell
you
but
your
gervais
is
wrong
if
he
thinks
i
can
be
slighted
and
robbed
of
my
dues
i
know
enough
to
make
trouble
for
him
and
i
know
where
to
take
my
knowledge
he
will
not
find
it
easy
to
shut
my
mouth
afterward
except
with
good
broad
gold
pieces
enfin
are
you
telling
me
the
hour
i
said
impatiently
i
was
ill
at
ease
my
only
wish
was
to
get
the
errand
done
and
be
gone
he
laid
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
made
me
bend
to
him
and
even
then
spoke
so
low
i
could
scarce
catch
the
words
they
have
fixed
positively
on
they
will
leave
by
this
door
and
take
the
route
i
described
last
night
to
gervais
they
will
start
as
soon
as
the
streets
are
quiet
sometime
between
ten
and
eleven
they
must
allow
an
hour
to
reach
the
gate
and
the
man
goes
off
at
twelve
in
all
likelihood
they
will
not
set
out
before
a
quarter
of
eleven
le
duc
does
not
care
to
be
recognized
so
they
planned
to
kill
lucas
at
monsieur
side
had
not
dared
to
tell
me
that
but
he
had
looked
me
straight
in
the
face
and
sworn
on
the
cross
no
harm
was
meant
to
le
duc
natheless
the
thing
looked
ugly
my
heart
leaped
up
at
the
next
words
also
vigo
will
go
vigo
not
so
loud
you
will
have
the
guard
on
us
yes
he
is
to
go
at
first
monsieur
did
not
tell
even
him
he
desired
to
keep
this
visit
to
the
king
so
secret
but
this
morning
he
took
vigo
into
his
confidence
and
nothing
would
serve
the
man
but
to
go
he
watches
over
monsieur
like
a
hen
over
a
chick
then
it
will
be
three
to
three
i
said
i
thought
of
gervais
and
pontou
for
of
course
i
would
take
no
part
in
it
three
to
two
lucas
will
not
fight
lucas
must
be
a
poltroon
indeed
but
vigo
and
monsieur
i
began
aye
they
are
quick
enough
with
their
swords
your
side
must
be
quicker
that
all
if
you
are
sudden
enough
you
can
easily
kill
the
duke
before
he
can
draw
talk
of
words
like
thunderbolts
all
the
thunder
of
heaven
could
not
have
whelmed
me
like
those
words
and
his
oaths
it
the
duke
after
all
i
could
not
speak
i
looked
i
know
not
how
but
it
was
dusky
in
the
arch
it
sounds
simple
he
went
on
but
three
of
you
as
you
are
you
will
have
trouble
with
vigo
that
is
all
i
have
told
you
all
i
must
get
back
before
i
am
missed
good
luck
to
the
enterprise
still
i
stood
like
a
block
of
wood
tell
gervais
to
remember
me
he
said
and
opening
the
door
passed
in
i
heard
him
lock
and
bolt
it
after
him
and
his
footsteps
hurrying
down
the
passageway
then
i
came
to
myself
and
sprang
to
the
door
and
beat
upon
it
furiously
but
if
he
heard
he
was
afraid
to
respond
after
a
futile
moment
that
seemed
an
hour
i
rushed
out
of
the
arch
and
around
to
the
great
gate
the
grilles
were
closed
as
before
but
the
sentry
face
luckily
was
strange
to
me
open
open
i
shouted
breathless
i
must
see
le
duc
who
are
you
he
demanded
staring
my
name
is
broux
i
have
news
for
le
duc
let
me
in
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
why
i
suppose
then
i
must
let
you
in
that
good
fellow
answered
drawing
back
the
bolts
but
you
must
wait
here
till
the
gate
was
open
i
took
base
advantage
of
him
by
sliding
under
his
arm
and
shooting
across
the
court
up
the
steps
to
the
house
the
door
stood
open
and
a
couple
of
lackeys
lounged
on
a
bench
in
the
hall
le
duc
i
cried
i
must
see
him
they
jumped
up
the
picture
of
bewilderment
who
are
you
how
came
you
here
cried
the
of
the
two
the
sentry
opened
for
me
where
am
i
to
find
le
duc
i
must
see
him
i
have
news
le
duc
sees
no
one
the
second
lackey
announced
pompously
but
i
must
see
him
i
tell
you
i
repeated
i
had
completely
lost
what
little
head
i
ever
had
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
could
not
see
le
duc
on
the
instant
i
should
find
him
weltering
in
his
gore
i
must
see
him
i
cried
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
from
whom
do
you
come
that
my
affair
enough
that
i
come
with
news
of
the
highest
moment
you
will
be
sorry
if
i
you
do
not
get
me
quickly
to
le
duc
they
looked
at
each
other
somewhat
impressed
i
will
go
for
constant
said
the
one
who
had
spoken
first
constant
was
master
of
the
household
le
duc
had
inherited
him
with
the
estate
and
kept
him
in
his
place
for
old
time
sake
he
was
old
fussy
and
and
withal
no
friend
to
me
i
had
rather
you
fetched
vigo
i
said
oh
vigo
will
not
come
he
is
with
monsieur
if
i
bring
constant
it
is
the
best
i
can
do
for
you
i
had
recovered
myself
sufficiently
by
this
time
to
remember
the
nature
of
lackeys
and
gave
the
messenger
the
last
silver
piece
i
had
in
the
world
he
regarded
it
contemptuously
but
pocketed
it
and
departed
in
leisurely
fashion
up
the
stairs
the
other
was
not
too
grand
to
me
what
sort
of
news
have
you
do
you
come
from
the
king
he
asked
in
a
lowered
voice
no
from
de
valère
no
then
who
the
devil
are
you
félix
broux
of
st
quentin
ah
quentin
he
said
as
if
he
found
that
rather
tame
you
bring
news
from
there
no
i
do
not
think
you
i
shall
tell
you
this
news
is
for
monsieur
it
wo
reach
monsieur
unless
you
learn
politeness
toward
the
gentlemen
of
his
household
he
retorted
we
were
getting
into
a
lively
quarrel
when
constant
appeared
on
the
stairway
constant
and
the
lackey
who
had
fetched
him
and
two
more
lackeys
and
a
page
all
of
whom
had
somehow
scented
that
something
was
in
the
wind
they
came
flocking
about
us
as
i
said
ah
constant
you
know
me
félix
broux
of
quentin
i
must
see
le
duc
constant
face
of
surprise
at
me
changed
to
one
of
malice
down
at
quentin
he
had
suffered
much
from
us
pages
as
a
slow
peevish
old
dotard
must
i
had
played
many
a
prank
on
him
but
i
had
not
thought
he
would
revenge
himself
at
such
time
as
this
he
looked
at
me
with
a
spiteful
grin
and
said
to
the
men
he
lies
i
do
not
know
him
i
never
saw
him
never
saw
me
félix
broux
i
cried
completely
taken
aback
no
maintained
constant
you
are
an
impostor
impostor
nonsense
i
cried
out
constant
you
know
me
as
well
as
you
know
yourself
i
say
i
must
see
the
duke
his
life
is
in
danger
constant
was
paying
off
old
scores
with
interest
an
impostor
he
yelled
shrilly
or
else
a
madman
or
an
assassin
that
is
the
truth
said
some
one
laying
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
turned
two
men
of
the
guard
had
come
up
my
friend
of
just
now
and
my
foe
of
the
morning
it
was
the
latter
who
held
me
and
said
this
is
the
very
rascal
who
sprang
on
monsieur
in
the
morning
lucas
threw
him
off
else
he
might
have
stabbed
monsieur
we
were
fools
enough
to
let
him
go
free
but
this
time
he
shall
not
get
off
so
easy
i
am
innocent
of
all
thought
of
harm
i
cried
i
am
le
duc
loyal
servant
i
meant
no
harm
this
morning
and
i
mean
none
now
i
am
here
to
save
monsieur
life
he
is
here
to
kill
monsieur
he
is
an
assassin
screamed
constant
flog
him
men
he
will
own
the
truth
then
i
am
no
assassin
i
shouted
struggling
in
their
grasp
let
me
go
villains
let
me
go
i
tell
you
monsieur
life
is
at
stake
very
life
i
tell
you
they
paid
me
no
heed
not
one
of
them
save
hat
lying
knave
constant
knew
me
as
other
than
the
shabby
fellow
who
had
acted
suspiciously
in
the
morning
they
were
dragging
me
to
the
door
in
spite
of
my
shouts
and
struggles
when
suddenly
a
ringing
voice
spoke
from
above
what
is
this
rumpus
who
talks
of
monsieur
life
the
guards
halted
dead
and
i
cried
out
joyfully
vigo
yes
i
am
vigo
the
big
man
answered
striding
down
the
stairs
who
are
you
i
wanted
to
shout
félix
broux
monsieur
page
but
a
sort
of
nightmare
dread
came
over
me
lest
vigo
too
should
disclaim
me
and
my
voice
stuck
in
my
throat
whoever
you
are
you
will
be
taught
not
to
make
a
racket
in
le
hall
by
the
saints
it
the
boy
félix
at
the
friendliness
in
his
voice
the
guards
dropped
their
hands
from
me
vigo
i
said
i
have
news
for
monsieur
of
the
gravest
moment
i
am
come
on
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
i
am
stopped
in
the
hall
by
lackeys
he
looked
at
me
sternly
this
is
not
one
of
your
fooleries
félix
no
m
vigo
come
with
me
vii
divided
that
was
vigo
way
the
toughest
snarl
untangled
at
his
touch
he
had
more
sense
and
fewer
airs
than
any
other
he
saw
at
once
that
i
was
in
earnest
and
constant
voluble
protests
were
as
so
much
wind
the
title
does
not
make
the
man
though
constant
was
master
of
the
household
and
vigo
only
equery
yet
vigo
ruled
every
corner
of
the
establishment
and
every
man
in
it
save
only
monsieur
who
ruled
him
he
said
no
word
to
me
as
we
climbed
the
broad
stair
neither
reproved
me
for
the
fracas
nor
questioned
me
about
my
coming
he
would
not
pry
into
monsieur
business
and
save
as
i
concerned
monsieur
he
had
no
interest
in
me
whatsoever
he
led
the
way
straight
into
an
antechamber
where
a
page
sprang
up
to
bar
our
passage
no
one
may
enter
vigo
not
even
you
le
duc
has
ordered
it
why
félix
you
in
paris
i
enter
said
vigo
and
sweeping
marcel
aside
he
knocked
loudly
i
came
last
night
i
found
time
to
say
under
my
breath
to
my
old
comrade
before
the
door
was
opened
the
handsome
secretary
whom
i
had
taken
for
the
count
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
askance
at
us
he
knew
me
at
once
and
wondered
you
can
not
enter
vigo
le
duc
is
occupied
he
made
to
shut
the
door
but
vigo
foot
was
over
the
sill
natheless
i
must
enter
he
answered
unabashed
and
pushed
his
way
into
the
room
then
you
must
answer
for
it
returned
the
secretary
with
a
scowl
that
sat
ill
on
his
delicate
face
shall
answer
for
it
if
it
turns
out
a
mare
nest
said
vigo
in
a
low
meaning
voice
to
me
but
i
hardly
heard
him
i
passed
him
and
lucas
and
flew
down
the
long
room
to
monsieur
le
duc
was
seated
before
a
table
heaped
with
papers
he
had
been
watching
the
scene
at
the
door
in
surprise
and
anger
he
looked
at
me
with
a
sharp
frown
while
the
at
his
feet
rose
on
its
haunches
growling
roland
i
said
the
dog
sprang
up
and
came
to
me
félix
broux
monsieur
exclaimed
with
his
quick
warm
smile
a
smile
no
man
in
france
could
match
for
radiance
i
had
no
thought
of
kneeling
of
making
obeisance
of
waiting
permission
to
speak
monsieur
i
cried
half
choked
there
is
a
plot
a
vile
plot
to
murder
you
where
at
st
quentin
no
monsieur
here
in
paris
in
the
streets
when
you
go
to
the
king
monsieur
sprang
to
his
feet
his
hand
on
his
sword
lucas
turned
white
vigo
swore
monsieur
cried
how
in
god
name
know
you
that
you
have
been
betrayed
monsieur
your
plan
is
known
you
leave
the
house
near
a
quarter
of
eleven
to
go
in
secret
to
the
king
you
leave
by
the
little
door
in
the
alley
diable
breathed
vigo
they
set
on
you
on
your
way
three
of
them
to
run
you
through
before
you
can
draw
but
ventre
bleu
monsieur
is
not
alone
no
he
walks
between
you
and
m
lucas
not
one
of
them
spoke
they
stared
at
me
as
if
i
were
something
uncanny
i
a
raw
country
boy
disclosing
a
perfect
knowledge
of
their
most
intimate
plans
how
know
you
this
monsieur
demanded
of
me
but
he
was
not
looking
at
me
his
keen
glance
went
first
to
lucas
then
to
vigo
the
two
men
who
had
shared
his
confidence
the
secretary
cried
out
you
can
not
think
monsieur
that
i
betrayed
you
vigo
said
nothing
his
steady
eyes
never
left
monsieur
face
no
answered
monsieur
to
lucas
i
can
not
think
it
and
to
vigo
he
said
i
shall
accuse
you
when
i
accuse
myself
but
none
knew
this
thing
save
our
three
selves
and
his
gaze
went
back
to
lucas
it
is
not
likely
to
be
he
i
said
impelled
to
be
just
to
him
though
i
did
not
like
him
for
they
meant
to
kill
him
as
well
lucas
started
then
instantly
recovered
himself
a
comprehensive
plot
monsieur
he
said
with
a
smile
then
who
was
it
cried
monsieur
to
me
you
know
speak
there
is
a
spy
in
the
house
an
eavesdropper
i
said
and
then
paused
aye
said
monsieur
who
now
the
answer
to
this
was
easy
yet
i
flinched
before
it
for
i
knew
well
enough
what
monsieur
would
do
he
feared
no
man
and
waited
on
no
man
advice
and
if
he
was
a
good
lover
he
was
a
good
hater
he
would
not
inform
the
governor
and
await
the
tardy
course
of
justice
that
would
probably
accomplish
nothing
nor
would
he
consider
the
troubled
times
and
the
danger
of
his
position
and
ignore
the
affair
as
many
would
have
deemed
best
he
would
not
stop
to
think
what
the
sixteen
might
have
to
say
to
it
no
he
would
call
out
his
guards
and
slay
the
plotters
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
like
the
wolves
they
were
it
was
right
he
should
but
i
owed
my
life
to
his
name
man
his
name
monsieur
was
crying
monsieur
i
returned
flushing
hot
monsieur
do
you
know
his
name
yes
monsieur
i
know
his
name
but
monsieur
looked
at
me
in
surprise
and
frowning
impatience
quickly
lucas
struck
in
monsieur
i
have
grave
doubts
of
the
boy
honesty
doubts
cried
monsieur
with
a
sudden
laugh
it
is
not
a
case
for
doubts
the
boy
states
facts
he
seated
himself
in
his
chair
his
face
growing
stern
again
the
little
action
seemed
to
make
him
no
longer
merely
my
questioner
but
my
judge
now
félix
broux
let
us
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
monsieur
i
began
struggling
to
put
the
case
clearly
i
learned
of
the
plot
by
accident
i
did
not
guess
for
a
long
time
it
was
you
who
were
the
victim
when
i
found
out
that
i
came
straight
here
to
you
monsieur
there
are
four
men
in
the
plot
and
one
of
them
has
stood
my
friend
and
my
assassin
he
is
a
villain
i
acknowledged
for
he
swore
no
harm
was
meant
to
you
he
swore
it
was
only
a
private
grudge
against
lucas
but
when
one
of
them
let
out
the
truth
i
came
straight
to
you
that
is
likely
true
said
vigo
for
he
was
ready
to
kill
the
men
who
barred
his
way
you
were
in
a
plot
to
kill
my
secretary
ah
monsieur
i
cried
you
félix
broux
i
curled
with
shame
lucas
had
struck
me
i
muttered
i
thought
the
fight
was
fair
enough
and
they
threatened
my
life
monsieur
contemptuous
eyes
shrivelled
me
as
flame
shrivels
a
leaf
you
a
broux
of
st
quentin
lucas
who
had
watched
me
close
all
the
while
as
they
all
three
did
said
now
i
believe
he
is
a
cheat
monsieur
there
is
no
plot
he
has
learned
of
your
plan
through
the
eavesdropper
he
speaks
of
and
thinks
to
make
credit
out
of
a
tale
of
murder
no
answered
monsieur
you
may
think
that
lucas
for
he
is
a
stranger
to
you
but
i
know
him
he
was
a
fool
sometimes
but
he
was
never
dishonest
you
used
to
be
fond
of
me
félix
what
has
happened
to
make
you
consort
with
my
enemies
ah
monsieur
i
love
you
i
have
always
loved
you
i
cried
i
am
not
lying
now
nor
cheating
you
there
is
a
plot
i
learned
it
and
came
straight
to
you
though
i
was
under
oath
not
to
betray
them
then
in
heaven
name
félix
burst
out
vigo
which
side
are
you
on
monsieur
began
to
laugh
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
know
for
by
quentin
i
can
make
nothing
of
it
monsieur
insisted
lucas
whatever
he
was
once
i
believe
him
a
trickster
now
monsieur
bent
his
keen
eyes
on
me
no
he
is
plainly
in
earnest
therefore
with
patience
i
look
to
get
some
sense
out
of
this
snarl
of
a
story
something
is
there
we
have
not
yet
fathomed
will
monsieur
let
me
speak
i
have
done
naught
but
urge
you
to
do
so
for
some
time
past
he
answered
dryly
monsieur
you
know
my
father
would
not
let
me
leave
quentin
with
you
three
months
back
but
at
length
he
said
i
should
come
and
i
reached
paris
last
night
and
since
it
was
late
lodged
at
an
inn
this
morning
i
came
to
your
gate
but
the
guard
would
not
let
me
enter
i
was
so
mad
to
see
you
monsieur
that
when
you
drove
out
i
sprang
up
on
your
ah
said
monsieur
a
new
light
breaking
in
upon
him
that
was
you
félix
i
did
not
know
you
i
was
thinking
of
other
matters
and
lucas
took
you
for
a
miscreant
now
i
sorry
if
i
had
been
a
noble
he
could
not
have
spoken
franker
apology
but
at
once
he
was
stern
again
and
because
my
secretary
took
you
in
all
good
faith
for
a
possible
assassin
and
struck
you
to
save
me
you
turn
traitor
and
take
part
in
a
plot
to
set
on
him
and
kill
him
i
had
believed
that
of
some
hired
lackey
not
of
a
broux
monsieur
i
was
wrong
a
thousand
times
wrong
i
knew
that
as
soon
as
i
had
sworn
and
when
i
found
it
was
you
they
meant
i
came
to
you
oath
or
no
oath
there
spoke
the
broux
cried
monsieur
with
his
brilliant
smile
now
you
are
félix
who
are
my
murderers
we
had
come
round
in
a
circle
to
the
place
where
we
had
stuck
before
and
here
we
stuck
again
monsieur
i
would
tell
you
all
before
you
could
count
ten
tell
you
their
names
their
whereabouts
everything
were
it
not
for
one
man
who
stood
my
friend
the
duke
eyes
flashed
you
call
him
that
my
assassin
he
is
an
assassin
i
was
forced
to
answer
even
assassin
and
a
perjurer
but
but
monsieur
he
saved
my
life
from
the
other
at
the
risk
of
his
own
how
can
i
pay
him
back
by
betraying
him
according
to
your
own
account
he
betrayed
you
aye
he
lied
to
me
i
said
brokenly
yet
monsieur
if
it
were
your
own
case
and
one
had
saved
your
life
were
he
the
scum
of
the
gutter
would
you
send
him
to
his
death
to
whom
do
you
owe
your
first
duty
monsieur
to
you
then
speak
but
i
could
not
do
it
though
i
knew
for
a
villain
yet
he
had
saved
my
life
monsieur
i
can
not
the
duke
cried
out
this
to
me
there
was
a
silence
i
stood
with
hanging
head
the
picture
of
a
knave
shame
so
filled
me
that
i
could
not
look
up
to
meet
monsieur
sentence
but
when
i
had
remembered
the
good
hater
in
monsieur
i
should
have
remembered
too
the
good
lover
monsieur
had
been
fond
of
me
at
quentin
as
i
waited
for
the
lightning
to
strike
he
said
with
utmost
gentleness
félix
let
me
understand
you
in
what
manner
did
this
man
save
your
life
now
that
was
like
my
lord
though
a
hot
man
he
loved
fairness
and
ever
strove
to
do
the
just
thing
and
his
patience
was
the
finer
that
it
was
not
his
nature
his
leniency
fired
me
with
a
sudden
hope
monsieur
there
are
four
of
them
in
the
plot
but
one
can
not
be
as
vile
as
the
others
since
he
saved
my
life
monsieur
if
i
tell
you
will
you
let
that
one
go
i
shall
do
as
i
see
fit
he
answered
all
the
duke
félix
will
you
speak
if
monsieur
will
promise
to
let
him
go
insolence
sirrah
i
do
not
bargain
with
my
servants
his
words
were
like
whips
i
flinched
before
his
proud
anger
and
for
the
second
time
stood
with
hanging
head
awaiting
his
sentence
and
again
he
did
what
i
could
not
guess
he
cried
out
félix
you
are
blind
besotted
mad
you
know
not
what
you
do
i
am
in
constant
danger
the
city
is
filled
with
my
enemies
the
leagues
hate
me
and
are
ever
plotting
mischief
against
me
every
day
their
mistrust
and
hatred
grow
i
did
a
bold
thing
in
coming
to
paris
but
i
had
a
great
end
to
serve
to
pave
a
way
into
the
capital
for
the
catholic
king
and
bring
the
land
to
peace
for
that
i
live
in
hourly
jeopardy
and
risk
my
life
on
foot
in
the
streets
if
i
am
killed
more
than
my
life
is
lost
the
church
may
lose
the
king
and
this
dear
france
of
ours
be
harried
to
a
desert
in
the
civil
wars
i
had
braced
myself
to
bear
monsieur
anger
but
this
appeal
pierced
me
through
and
through
all
the
love
and
loyalty
in
me
and
i
had
much
though
it
may
not
have
seemed
so
rose
in
answer
to
monsieur
call
i
fell
on
my
knees
before
him
choked
with
sobs
monsieur
hand
lay
on
my
head
as
he
said
quietly
now
félix
speak
i
answered
huskily
would
monsieur
have
me
turn
judas
judas
betrayed
his
it
was
my
last
stand
my
last
redoubt
had
fallen
i
raised
my
head
to
tell
him
all
maybe
it
was
the
tears
in
my
eyes
but
as
i
lifted
them
to
le
duc
i
saw
not
him
but
looking
at
me
with
warm
good
will
as
he
had
looked
when
he
was
saving
me
from
gervais
i
saw
him
i
say
plain
before
my
eyes
the
next
instant
there
was
nothing
but
monsieur
face
of
rising
impatience
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
said
kill
me
monsieur
i
can
not
tell
nom
de
dieu
he
shouted
springing
up
i
shut
my
eyes
and
waited
had
he
slain
me
then
and
there
it
were
no
more
than
my
deserts
monsieur
said
vigo
immovably
shall
i
go
for
the
boot
i
opened
my
eyes
then
monsieur
stood
quite
still
his
brow
knotted
his
hands
clenched
as
if
to
keep
them
off
me
monsieur
i
said
send
for
the
boot
the
thumbscrew
whatever
you
please
i
deserve
it
and
i
will
bear
it
monsieur
it
is
not
that
i
will
not
tell
it
is
something
stronger
than
i
he
burst
into
an
angry
laugh
say
you
are
possessed
of
a
devil
and
i
will
believe
it
my
faith
though
you
are
a
lad
and
i
duke
of
quentin
i
seem
to
be
getting
the
worst
of
it
there
is
the
boot
monsieur
monsieur
laughed
again
no
less
angrily
that
does
not
help
me
my
good
vigo
i
can
not
torture
a
broux
there
monsieur
is
wrong
the
lad
has
been
disloyal
and
insolent
if
he
is
a
broux
granted
vigo
said
le
duc
but
he
did
not
add
fetch
the
boot
vigo
went
on
with
steady
persistence
he
has
not
been
loyal
to
monsieur
and
his
interests
in
refusing
to
tell
what
he
knows
and
if
he
goes
counter
to
monsieur
interests
he
is
a
traitor
broux
or
no
broux
he
has
no
claim
to
be
treated
as
other
than
an
enemy
these
are
serious
times
monsieur
does
not
well
to
play
with
his
dangers
the
boy
must
tell
what
he
knows
am
i
to
go
for
the
boot
monsieur
le
duc
was
silent
for
a
moment
while
the
hot
flush
that
had
sprung
to
his
face
died
away
then
he
answered
vigo
nevertheless
it
is
owing
to
félix
that
i
shall
not
walk
out
to
meet
my
death
the
secretary
had
stood
silent
for
a
long
time
fingering
nervously
the
papers
on
the
table
i
had
forgotten
his
presence
when
now
he
stepped
forward
and
said
if
i
might
be
permitted
a
suggestion
monsieur
monsieur
silenced
him
with
a
sharp
gesture
félix
broux
he
said
to
me
you
have
been
following
a
bad
plan
no
man
can
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
you
are
either
my
loyal
servant
or
my
enemy
one
thing
or
the
other
now
i
am
loath
to
hurt
you
you
have
seen
how
i
am
loath
to
hurt
you
i
give
you
one
more
chance
to
be
honest
go
and
think
it
over
if
in
half
an
hour
you
have
decided
that
you
are
my
true
man
well
and
good
if
not
by
quentin
we
will
see
what
a
flogging
can
do
viii
unpleased
but
unprotesting
vigo
led
me
out
into
the
anteroom
those
men
who
judged
by
the
outside
of
things
and
knowing
vigo
iron
ways
said
that
he
ruled
monsieur
were
wrong
the
big
equery
gave
me
over
to
the
charge
of
marcel
and
returned
to
the
inner
room
hardly
had
the
door
closed
behind
him
when
the
page
burst
out
what
is
it
what
is
the
coil
what
have
you
done
félix
now
you
can
guess
i
was
too
for
chatter
i
had
defied
and
disobeyed
my
liege
lord
i
could
never
hope
for
pardon
or
any
respect
they
threatened
me
with
flogging
well
let
them
flog
they
could
not
make
my
back
any
sorer
than
my
conscience
was
for
i
had
not
the
satisfaction
in
my
trouble
of
thinking
that
i
had
done
right
monsieur
danger
should
have
been
my
first
consideration
what
was
perjured
scoundrel
in
comparison
with
le
duc
and
yet
i
knew
that
at
the
end
of
the
i
should
not
tell
at
the
end
of
the
flogging
i
should
not
tell
i
had
warned
monsieur
that
i
would
have
done
had
it
been
the
breaking
of
a
thousand
oaths
but
give
up
not
if
they
tore
me
limb
from
limb
what
is
it
all
about
cried
marcel
again
you
look
as
glum
as
a
jesuit
in
lent
what
is
the
matter
with
you
félix
i
have
cooked
my
goose
i
said
gloomily
what
have
you
done
nothing
that
i
can
speak
about
but
i
am
out
of
monsieur
books
what
was
old
vigo
after
when
he
took
you
in
to
monsieur
i
never
saw
anything
so
bold
when
monsieur
says
he
is
not
to
be
disturbed
he
means
it
i
had
nothing
to
tell
him
and
was
silent
what
is
it
ca
you
tell
an
old
chum
no
it
is
monsieur
private
business
well
you
are
grumpy
he
cried
out
pettishly
you
must
be
out
of
grace
he
seemed
to
decide
that
nothing
was
to
be
made
out
of
me
just
now
on
this
tack
and
with
unabated
persistence
tried
another
is
it
true
félix
what
one
of
the
men
said
just
now
that
you
tried
to
speak
with
monsieur
this
morning
when
he
drove
out
yes
but
monsieur
did
not
recognize
me
like
enough
marcel
answered
he
has
a
way
of
late
of
falling
into
these
absent
fits
monsieur
is
not
the
man
he
was
he
does
look
older
i
said
and
worn
i
trow
the
risk
he
is
running
pshaw
cried
marcel
with
scorn
is
monsieur
a
man
to
mind
risks
no
it
is
le
comte
i
started
like
a
guilty
thing
remembering
what
had
told
me
and
i
wrapped
in
my
petty
troubles
had
forgotten
monsieur
had
lost
his
only
son
and
i
had
chosen
this
time
to
defy
him
how
long
ago
was
it
i
asked
in
a
hushed
voice
since
le
comte
left
us
it
will
be
three
weeks
next
friday
how
did
he
die
die
echoed
marcel
you
crazy
fellow
he
is
not
dead
it
was
my
turn
to
stare
then
where
is
he
it
would
be
money
in
my
pouch
if
i
knew
what
made
you
think
him
dead
félix
a
man
told
me
so
pardieu
he
cried
in
some
excitement
when
who
was
it
i
do
not
know
the
man
name
it
seems
you
know
very
little
pardieu
i
do
not
believe
le
comte
is
dead
what
else
did
your
man
say
nothing
he
only
said
the
comte
de
mar
was
dead
pshaw
i
do
believe
it
you
believe
everything
you
hear
because
you
are
just
from
the
country
no
if
le
comte
were
dead
we
should
hear
of
it
oh
certainly
we
should
hear
but
where
is
he
then
you
say
he
is
lost
aye
he
has
not
been
seen
or
heard
of
since
the
day
they
had
the
quarrel
who
quarrelled
why
he
and
monsieur
answered
marcel
in
a
lower
voice
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
inner
room
le
comte
has
been
his
own
master
too
long
to
take
kindly
to
a
hand
over
him
that
is
the
whole
of
it
he
has
a
quick
temper
so
has
monsieur
but
i
thought
of
monsieur
wonderful
patience
and
i
cried
shame
what
now
to
speak
like
that
of
monsieur
enfin
it
is
true
he
is
none
the
worse
for
that
but
i
suppose
if
monsieur
had
a
cloven
hoof
one
must
not
mention
it
one
would
get
his
head
broken
oh
you
broux
he
cried
out
i
have
not
seen
you
for
half
a
year
i
had
forgotten
that
with
you
the
quentins
rank
with
the
saints
you
you
are
a
hired
servant
you
come
to
monsieur
as
you
might
come
to
anybody
with
the
broux
it
is
different
i
retorted
angrily
yet
i
could
not
but
know
in
my
heart
that
any
hired
servant
might
have
served
monsieur
better
than
i
my
boasted
loyalty
what
was
it
but
i
said
more
humbly
pshaw
it
is
no
great
matter
tell
me
about
the
quarrel
and
so
i
will
if
you
civil
in
the
first
place
there
was
the
question
of
le
comte
marriage
what
is
he
married
oh
by
no
means
monsieur
would
have
it
you
see
félix
marcel
said
in
a
tone
deep
with
importance
we
navarre
men
now
of
course
said
i
i
suppose
you
would
say
course
just
like
that
to
mayenne
himself
you
greenhorn
it
is
as
much
as
our
lives
are
worth
to
side
openly
with
navarre
the
league
may
attack
us
any
day
i
know
i
said
uneasily
every
chance
word
marcel
spoke
seemed
to
dye
my
guilt
the
deeper
but
what
has
this
to
do
with
le
marriage
i
asked
him
why
he
was
more
than
half
a
leaguer
perhaps
he
is
one
now
some
say
he
and
monsieur
were
at
daggers
drawn
about
politics
but
i
warrant
it
was
about
mlle
de
montluc
they
call
her
the
rose
of
lorraine
the
duke
of
mayenne
own
cousin
and
housemate
and
we
king
men
so
of
course
it
was
no
match
for
monsieur
son
they
say
mayenne
himself
favoured
the
marriage
but
our
duke
would
hear
of
it
however
the
backbone
of
the
trouble
was
de
grammont
and
who
may
he
be
he
a
cousin
of
the
house
he
and
le
comte
are
as
thick
as
thieves
before
we
came
to
paris
they
lodged
together
so
when
le
comte
came
here
he
brought
de
grammont
dare
i
speak
ill
of
monsieur
cousin
félix
for
i
would
say
at
the
risk
of
a
broken
head
that
he
is
a
churl
you
can
not
deny
it
you
never
saw
him
no
nor
le
comte
either
why
you
have
seen
le
comte
never
the
only
time
he
came
to
quentin
i
was
laid
up
in
bed
with
a
strained
leg
i
missed
the
chase
do
you
remember
why
you
are
right
that
was
the
time
you
fell
out
of
the
buttery
window
when
you
were
stealing
tarts
and
margot
got
after
you
with
the
broomstick
i
remember
very
well
he
was
for
calling
up
all
our
old
pranks
at
the
château
but
it
was
little
joy
to
me
to
think
on
those
fortunate
days
when
i
was
favourite
i
said
nay
marcel
you
were
telling
me
of
le
comte
and
the
quarrel
oh
as
for
that
it
is
easy
told
you
see
le
comte
and
this
grammont
took
no
interest
in
monsieur
affairs
and
they
had
very
little
to
say
to
him
and
he
to
them
they
had
plenty
of
friends
in
paris
leaguers
or
not
and
they
used
to
go
about
amusing
themselves
but
at
last
de
grammont
had
such
a
run
of
bad
luck
at
the
tables
that
he
not
only
emptied
his
own
pockets
but
le
comte
as
well
i
will
say
for
le
comte
that
he
would
share
his
last
sou
with
any
one
who
asked
and
so
would
any
st
quentin
oh
you
are
always
piping
up
for
the
st
quentins
he
should
have
no
need
in
this
house
we
jumped
up
to
find
vigo
standing
behind
us
what
have
you
been
saying
of
monsieur
nothing
vigo
stammered
the
page
i
only
said
le
comte
you
are
not
to
discuss
le
comte
do
you
hear
yes
m
vigo
then
obey
and
you
félix
i
shall
have
a
little
interview
with
you
shortly
as
you
will
vigo
i
said
hopelessly
he
went
off
down
the
corridor
and
marcel
turned
angrily
on
me
mon
dieu
félix
you
have
got
me
into
a
nice
scrape
with
your
eternal
chanting
of
the
praises
of
monsieur
like
as
not
i
shall
get
a
beating
for
it
vigo
never
forgets
i
am
sorry
i
said
we
should
not
have
been
talking
of
it
no
we
should
not
come
over
here
where
we
can
watch
both
doors
and
i
tell
you
the
rest
before
the
old
lynx
gets
back
we
sat
down
close
together
and
he
proceeded
in
a
low
tone
to
disobey
vigo
enfin
as
i
said
the
two
young
gentlemen
were
quite
sans
le
sou
for
things
had
come
to
a
point
where
le
duc
looked
pretty
black
at
any
application
for
funds
he
has
other
uses
for
his
gold
you
see
one
day
monsieur
was
expecting
some
one
to
whom
he
was
to
pay
a
thousand
pistoles
and
to
have
the
money
handy
he
put
it
in
a
secret
drawer
in
his
cabinet
in
the
room
yonder
the
man
arrives
and
is
taken
to
monsieur
private
room
monsieur
gives
him
his
orders
and
goes
to
the
cabinet
for
his
pistoles
no
pistoles
there
marcel
paused
dramatically
and
what
then
i
asked
well
it
appears
he
had
once
shown
le
comte
the
trick
of
the
drawer
so
he
sent
for
him
not
to
accuse
him
mind
you
for
le
comte
is
wild
enough
yet
monsieur
did
not
think
he
would
steal
pistoles
nor
would
he
i
will
stake
my
oath
no
monsieur
merely
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
shown
any
one
the
drawer
and
le
comte
answered
grammont
and
how
have
you
learned
all
this
oh
one
hears
one
does
with
one
ears
to
the
keyhole
it
behooves
you
félix
to
be
civil
to
your
better
i
made
pretence
of
looking
about
me
where
is
he
he
sits
here
i
am
page
to
the
duke
of
quentin
and
you
touché
i
admitted
bitterly
enough
little
marcel
my
junior
my
unquestioning
follower
in
the
old
days
was
now
indeed
my
better
quite
in
a
position
to
patronize
continue
if
you
please
marcel
yet
in
passing
i
should
like
to
ask
you
how
much
you
heard
our
talk
in
there
just
now
nothing
he
answered
candidly
when
they
are
so
far
down
the
room
one
can
not
hear
a
word
in
the
affair
of
the
pistoles
they
stood
near
the
cabinet
at
this
end
one
could
not
help
but
hear
as
for
listening
at
keyholes
i
scorn
it
yes
it
is
well
to
scorn
it
people
have
an
unpleasant
trick
of
opening
doors
so
suddenly
he
laughed
cheerfully
old
vigo
caught
us
certes
let
see
where
was
i
oh
yes
then
monsieur
put
on
his
proud
look
and
said
if
it
was
a
case
of
no
one
but
his
son
and
his
cousin
he
preferred
to
drop
the
matter
but
le
comte
got
out
of
him
what
the
trouble
was
and
went
off
for
grammont
red
as
fire
the
two
together
came
back
to
monsieur
and
denied
up
and
down
that
either
of
them
knew
aught
of
his
pistoles
or
had
told
of
the
secret
to
any
one
they
say
it
was
easy
to
see
that
monsieur
did
not
believe
grammont
but
he
did
not
give
him
the
lie
and
the
matter
came
near
dropping
there
for
le
duc
would
not
accuse
a
kinsman
but
then
lucas
gave
a
new
turn
to
the
affair
how
long
has
lucas
been
here
marcel
who
is
he
oh
he
a
rascal
of
a
huguenot
monsieur
picked
him
up
at
mantes
just
before
we
came
to
the
city
and
if
he
spies
on
monsieur
enemies
as
well
as
he
does
on
this
household
he
must
be
a
useful
man
he
has
that
long
nose
of
his
in
everything
let
me
tell
you
of
course
he
was
present
when
monsieur
missed
the
pistoles
so
then
quite
on
his
own
account
without
any
orders
he
took
two
of
the
men
and
searched
de
grammont
room
and
in
a
locked
chest
of
his
which
they
forced
open
they
found
five
hundred
of
the
pistoles
in
the
very
box
monsieur
had
kept
them
in
and
then
marcel
made
a
fine
gesture
and
then
pardieu
the
storm
broke
de
grammont
raved
like
a
madman
he
said
lucas
was
the
thief
and
had
put
half
the
sum
in
his
chest
to
divert
suspicion
he
said
it
was
a
plot
to
ruin
him
contrived
between
monsieur
and
his
henchman
lucas
it
is
true
enough
certes
that
monsieur
never
liked
him
he
threatened
monsieur
life
and
lucas
he
challenged
monsieur
and
monsieur
declined
to
cross
swords
with
a
thief
he
challenged
lucas
and
lucas
took
the
cue
from
monsieur
i
was
not
there
on
either
side
of
the
door
what
i
tell
you
has
leaked
out
bit
by
bit
from
lucas
for
monsieur
keeps
his
mouth
shut
the
upshot
of
the
matter
was
that
grammont
goes
at
lucas
with
a
knife
and
monsieur
has
the
guards
pitch
my
gentleman
into
the
street
then
le
comte
swore
a
big
oath
that
he
would
go
with
grammont
monsieur
told
him
if
he
went
in
such
company
it
would
be
forever
le
comte
swore
he
would
never
come
back
under
his
father
roof
if
le
duc
crawled
to
him
on
his
knees
to
beg
him
ah
i
cried
and
then
marry
that
all
le
comte
went
straight
out
of
this
gate
without
horse
or
squire
and
we
have
not
heard
a
word
of
either
of
them
since
he
paused
and
when
i
made
no
comment
said
a
trifle
aggrieved
eh
bien
you
take
it
calmly
but
you
would
not
had
you
been
here
it
was
an
altogether
lively
affair
it
would
surprise
me
a
whit
if
some
day
monsieur
should
be
attacked
as
he
drives
out
he
not
one
to
forget
an
injury
this
gervais
de
grammont
at
the
name
intelligence
flashed
over
me
sudden
and
clear
as
last
night
yet
this
thing
i
seemed
to
see
was
so
hideous
so
horrible
that
my
mind
recoiled
from
it
marcel
i
stammered
shuddering
marcel
mordieu
what
ails
you
is
some
one
walking
on
your
grave
marcel
how
is
le
comte
named
the
comte
de
mar
oh
do
you
mean
his
names
in
baptism
they
call
him
étienne
why
do
you
ask
what
is
it
it
was
a
certainty
then
yet
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
believe
this
horrible
thing
i
have
never
seen
him
how
does
he
look
oh
not
at
all
like
monsieur
he
has
fair
hair
and
gray
eyes
que
diable
for
i
had
flung
open
monsieur
door
and
dashed
in
ix
honour
of
monsieur
was
seated
at
his
table
talking
in
a
low
tone
and
hurriedly
to
lucas
they
started
and
stared
as
i
broke
in
upon
them
and
then
monsieur
cried
out
to
me
ah
félix
you
have
come
to
your
senses
i
will
tell
monsieur
all
the
whole
story
he
tested
my
honesty
with
a
glance
then
looked
beyond
me
at
marcel
standing
agape
in
the
doorway
leave
us
marcel
go
leave
that
door
open
and
shut
the
door
into
the
corridor
marcel
obeyed
monsieur
turned
to
me
with
a
smile
now
félix
i
had
hardly
been
able
to
hold
my
words
back
while
marcel
was
disposed
of
monsieur
i
knew
not
myself
the
names
of
those
men
now
i
have
found
out
they
my
eyes
met
the
secretary
fixed
excitedly
upon
me
and
the
words
died
on
my
tongue
even
in
my
rage
i
had
the
grace
to
know
that
this
was
no
story
to
tell
monsieur
before
another
i
will
tell
monsieur
alone
you
may
speak
before
lucas
he
rejoined
impatiently
no
i
persisted
i
must
tell
monsieur
alone
he
saw
in
my
face
that
i
had
strong
reasons
for
asking
it
and
said
to
the
secretary
you
may
go
lucas
lucas
protested
le
duc
will
be
wiser
not
to
see
him
alone
he
is
not
to
be
trusted
perchance
monsieur
this
demand
covers
an
attack
on
your
life
the
warning
nettled
my
lord
he
answered
curtly
you
may
go
monsieur
go
lucas
passed
out
giving
me
as
he
went
a
look
of
hatred
that
startled
me
but
i
did
not
pay
it
much
heed
well
exclaimed
monsieur
but
by
this
time
i
had
bethought
myself
what
a
story
it
was
i
had
to
tell
a
father
of
his
son
i
could
not
blurt
it
out
in
two
words
i
stood
silent
not
knowing
how
to
start
félix
beware
how
much
longer
you
abuse
my
patience
monsieur
i
began
the
spy
in
the
house
is
named
martin
ah
cried
monsieur
so
it
is
louis
martin
how
he
knew
but
go
on
the
others
i
lay
the
night
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
not
far
from
the
denis
gate
i
said
still
beating
about
the
bush
at
the
sign
of
the
amour
de
dieu
opposite
is
a
closed
house
shuttered
with
iron
from
garret
to
cellar
you
can
enter
from
a
court
behind
it
is
here
that
they
plot
illustration
with
a
cry
monsieur
sprang
toward
me
monsieur
brows
drew
together
as
if
he
were
trying
to
recall
something
half
remembered
half
forgotten
but
the
men
he
cried
the
men
they
are
three
one
a
low
fellow
named
pontou
pontou
the
name
is
nothing
to
me
the
others
he
was
leaning
forward
eagerly
i
knew
of
what
he
was
thinking
the
quickest
way
to
reach
the
rue
coupejarrets
there
are
two
others
monsieur
i
said
slowly
young
men
noble
i
looked
at
him
but
no
light
whatever
had
broken
in
upon
him
their
names
lad
then
seeing
him
unsuspecting
the
fury
in
my
heart
surged
up
and
covered
every
other
feeling
i
burst
out
gervais
de
grammont
and
the
comte
de
mar
he
looked
me
in
the
face
and
he
knew
i
was
telling
the
truth
unexpected
as
it
was
hideous
as
it
was
yet
he
knew
i
was
telling
the
truth
i
had
seen
cowards
turn
pale
but
never
the
colour
washed
from
a
brave
man
face
the
sight
made
my
fingers
itch
to
strangle
that
cheat
with
a
cry
monsieur
sprang
toward
me
you
lie
you
cur
no
monsieur
i
gasped
it
is
the
truth
he
let
me
go
then
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
collar
of
the
dog
who
had
sprung
to
his
aid
but
monsieur
had
got
a
hurt
from
which
the
dumb
beast
loyalty
could
not
defend
him
he
stood
with
bowed
head
a
man
stricken
to
the
heart
core
full
of
wrath
as
i
was
the
tears
came
to
my
eyes
for
monsieur
he
recovered
himself
it
is
some
damnable
mistake
you
have
been
tricked
my
rage
blazed
up
again
no
they
tricked
me
once
not
again
not
this
time
i
knew
not
who
they
were
till
now
when
i
talked
with
marcel
the
two
things
fitted
then
it
is
your
guess
you
dare
to
say
no
i
know
i
interrupted
rudely
too
excited
to
remember
respect
shall
i
tell
what
these
men
were
like
i
had
never
seen
le
comte
nor
de
grammont
before
one
was
and
heavy
with
a
black
beard
and
a
black
scowl
whom
the
other
called
gervais
the
younger
was
called
étienne
tall
and
slender
with
gray
eyes
and
fair
hair
and
like
monsieur
i
cried
suddenly
aware
of
it
mordieu
how
he
is
like
though
he
is
light
in
face
in
voice
in
manner
he
speaks
like
monsieur
he
has
monsieur
laugh
i
was
blind
not
to
see
it
i
believe
that
was
why
i
loved
him
so
much
it
was
he
whom
you
would
not
betray
aye
that
was
before
i
knew
thinking
of
the
trust
i
had
given
him
my
wrath
boiled
up
again
monsieur
took
me
by
the
shoulder
and
looked
at
me
as
if
he
would
look
through
me
to
the
naked
soul
how
do
i
know
that
you
are
not
lying
monsieur
does
know
it
yes
he
answered
after
a
moment
alas
yes
i
know
it
he
stood
looking
at
me
with
the
dreariest
face
i
ever
saw
the
face
of
a
man
whose
son
has
sought
to
murder
him
looking
back
on
it
now
i
wonder
that
i
ever
went
to
monsieur
with
that
story
i
wonder
why
i
did
not
bury
the
shame
and
disgrace
of
it
in
my
own
heart
at
whatever
cost
keep
it
from
monsieur
but
the
thought
never
entered
my
head
then
i
was
so
full
of
black
rage
against
him
most
of
all
because
he
had
won
me
so
that
i
could
feel
nothing
else
i
knew
that
i
pitied
monsieur
yet
i
hardly
felt
it
tell
me
everything
how
you
met
them
all
else
i
shall
not
believe
a
word
of
your
devilish
rigmarole
monsieur
cried
out
i
told
him
the
whole
shameful
story
every
word
from
my
lightning
vision
to
my
gossip
with
marcel
in
the
antechamber
he
listening
in
hopeless
silence
at
length
i
finished
it
seemed
hours
since
he
had
spoken
at
last
he
said
then
it
is
true
the
grayness
of
his
face
drew
the
cry
from
me
the
villain
the
villain
take
care
félix
he
is
my
son
i
got
hold
of
my
cross
and
tore
it
off
breaking
the
chain
see
monsieur
that
is
the
cross
on
which
he
swore
the
plot
was
not
against
you
he
swore
it
and
gervais
de
grammont
laughed
i
swore
too
never
to
betray
them
two
perjuries
i
flung
the
cross
on
the
floor
and
stamped
on
it
splintering
it
profaner
cried
monsieur
it
is
no
sacrilege
i
retorted
that
is
no
holy
thing
since
he
has
touched
it
he
has
made
it
vile
scoundrel
assassin
parricide
monsieur
struck
the
words
from
my
lips
it
is
true
i
muttered
were
it
ten
times
true
you
have
no
right
to
say
it
no
i
have
none
i
answered
shamed
i
might
not
speak
ill
of
a
quentin
though
he
were
the
devil
own
but
my
rage
came
uppermost
again
i
can
bring
monsieur
to
the
house
in
twenty
minutes
vigo
and
a
handful
of
men
can
take
them
prisoners
before
they
suspect
aught
amiss
they
are
only
three
he
and
grammont
and
the
lackey
but
monsieur
shook
his
head
i
can
not
do
that
why
not
monsieur
can
i
take
my
own
son
prisoner
monsieur
need
not
go
said
i
wondering
in
his
place
i
would
have
gone
and
killed
with
my
own
hands
vigo
and
i
and
two
more
can
do
it
vigo
and
i
alone
if
monsieur
would
not
shame
him
before
the
men
i
guessed
at
what
he
was
thinking
not
even
you
and
vigo
he
answered
think
you
i
would
arrest
my
son
like
a
common
felon
shame
him
like
that
he
has
shamed
himself
i
cried
i
cared
not
whether
i
had
a
right
to
say
it
he
has
forgotten
his
honour
aye
but
i
have
remembered
mine
monsieur
monsieur
can
not
mean
to
let
him
go
but
his
eyes
told
me
that
he
did
mean
it
then
i
said
in
more
and
more
amazement
monsieur
forgives
him
his
face
set
sternly
no
he
answered
no
félix
he
has
placed
himself
beyond
my
forgiveness
then
we
will
go
there
alone
we
two
and
kill
him
kill
the
three
he
laughed
but
not
a
man
in
france
felt
less
mirthful
you
would
have
me
kill
my
son
he
would
have
killed
you
that
makes
no
difference
i
looked
at
him
groping
after
the
thoughts
that
swayed
him
and
catching
at
them
dimly
i
knew
them
for
the
principles
of
a
proud
and
man
but
there
was
no
room
for
them
in
my
angry
heart
monsieur
i
cried
will
you
let
three
villains
go
unpunished
for
the
sake
of
one
it
was
what
i
had
meant
to
do
awhile
back
but
the
case
was
changed
now
of
two
gervais
de
grammont
is
also
of
my
blood
monsieur
would
spare
him
as
well
him
the
ringleader
he
is
my
cousin
he
forgets
it
but
i
do
not
monsieur
will
you
have
no
vengeance
monsieur
looked
at
me
when
you
are
a
man
félix
broux
you
will
know
that
there
are
other
things
in
this
world
besides
vengeance
you
will
know
that
some
injuries
can
not
be
avenged
you
will
know
that
a
gentleman
can
not
use
the
same
weapons
that
blackguards
use
to
him
ah
monsieur
i
cried
monsieur
is
indeed
a
nobleman
but
i
was
furious
with
him
for
it
he
turned
abruptly
and
paced
down
the
room
the
dog
which
had
been
standing
at
his
side
stayed
still
looking
from
him
to
me
with
puzzled
troubled
eyes
he
knew
quite
well
something
was
wrong
and
vented
his
feelings
in
a
long
dismal
whine
monsieur
spoke
to
him
roland
bounded
up
to
him
and
licked
his
hand
they
walked
up
and
down
together
comforting
each
other
at
least
i
cried
in
desperation
monsieur
has
the
spy
he
laughed
only
a
man
in
utter
despair
could
have
laughed
then
as
he
did
even
the
spy
to
wreak
vengeance
on
consoles
you
somewhat
félix
but
does
it
seem
to
you
fair
that
a
tool
should
be
punished
when
the
leaders
go
free
no
said
i
but
it
is
the
common
way
that
is
a
true
word
he
said
turning
away
again
i
waited
till
he
faced
me
once
more
monsieur
will
not
suffer
the
spy
to
go
free
no
félix
he
shall
be
punished
lest
he
betray
again
he
passed
me
in
his
dreary
walk
half
a
dozen
times
he
passed
by
me
a
man
striving
to
collect
his
courage
to
take
up
his
life
once
more
but
i
thought
he
would
never
get
over
the
blow
a
husband
may
forget
his
wife
treachery
and
a
mother
will
forgive
her
child
but
a
father
can
neither
forget
nor
forgive
the
crime
of
the
son
who
bears
his
name
ah
monsieur
you
are
noble
and
i
love
you
i
cried
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
and
knelt
to
kiss
his
hand
monsieur
laid
that
kind
hand
on
my
shoulder
you
shall
serve
me
go
now
and
send
vigo
here
i
must
be
looking
to
the
country
business
x
and
le
gaucher
i
cursed
myself
for
a
fool
that
i
had
carried
the
tale
to
monsieur
it
should
have
been
my
business
to
keep
a
still
tongue
and
go
kill
myself
for
this
last
it
was
not
yet
too
late
marcel
was
hanging
about
in
the
corridor
and
to
him
i
gave
the
word
for
vigo
i
tore
away
from
his
eager
questionings
and
hurried
to
the
gate
in
the
morning
i
had
not
been
able
to
get
in
and
now
i
could
no
more
get
out
by
vigo
orders
no
man
might
leave
the
house
vigo
was
after
the
spy
of
course
monsieur
knew
the
traitor
now
he
would
inform
vigo
and
the
gates
would
be
open
for
honest
men
but
that
might
take
time
and
i
could
not
wait
five
minutes
i
had
the
audacity
to
cry
to
the
guards
le
duc
will
let
me
pass
out
i
refer
you
to
le
duc
the
men
were
impressed
they
had
a
respect
for
me
since
i
had
been
closeted
with
monsieur
yet
they
dared
not
disobey
vigo
for
their
lives
in
this
dilemma
the
poor
sentry
fearful
of
getting
into
trouble
whatever
he
did
sent
up
an
envoy
to
ask
monsieur
i
was
frightened
then
i
had
uttered
my
speech
in
sheer
bravado
and
was
very
doubtful
as
to
how
he
would
answer
my
impudence
but
he
was
utterly
careless
i
trow
what
i
did
for
presently
the
word
came
down
that
i
might
pass
out
the
sun
was
setting
as
i
hastened
along
the
streets
i
must
reach
the
rue
coupejarrets
before
dark
else
there
was
no
hope
for
me
a
man
in
his
senses
would
have
known
there
was
no
hope
anyway
who
but
a
madman
would
think
of
venturing
back
forsworn
to
those
three
villains
for
the
killing
of
one
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
aught
resulted
but
failure
and
death
yet
i
felt
no
jot
of
fear
as
i
plunged
into
the
mesh
of
crooked
streets
in
the
coupejarrets
quarter
only
ardour
to
reach
my
goal
when
on
turning
a
corner
i
came
upon
a
group
of
idlers
choking
the
narrow
ruelle
i
said
to
myself
that
a
dozen
parisians
in
the
way
could
no
more
stop
me
than
they
could
stop
a
charge
of
horse
all
heels
and
elbows
i
pushed
into
them
but
to
my
abasement
promptly
was
i
seized
upon
by
a
burly
porter
and
bidden
with
a
cuff
to
mind
my
manners
then
i
discovered
the
occasion
of
the
crowd
to
be
a
little
procession
of
choristers
out
of
a
neighbouring
church
jean
of
the
spire
it
was
though
i
knew
then
no
name
for
it
the
boys
were
singing
the
watchers
quiet
bareheaded
they
sang
as
if
there
were
nothing
in
the
world
but
piety
and
love
the
last
level
rays
of
the
sun
crowned
them
with
radiant
aureoles
painted
their
white
robes
with
glory
i
shut
my
eyes
dazzled
it
was
as
if
i
beheld
a
heavenly
host
when
i
opened
them
again
the
folk
at
my
side
were
kneeling
as
the
cross
came
by
i
knelt
too
but
the
holy
sign
spoke
to
me
only
of
the
crucifix
i
had
trampled
on
of
and
his
lies
i
prayed
to
the
good
god
to
let
me
kill
prayed
kneeling
there
on
the
cobbles
with
a
fervour
i
had
never
reached
before
when
i
rose
i
ran
on
at
redoubled
speed
never
doubting
that
a
just
god
would
strengthen
my
hand
would
make
my
cause
his
i
entered
the
little
court
the
shutter
was
fastened
as
before
but
i
had
my
dagger
and
could
again
free
the
bolt
i
could
creep
and
mayhap
stab
before
they
were
aware
of
my
coming
but
that
was
not
my
purpose
i
was
no
bravo
to
strike
in
the
back
but
the
instrument
of
a
righteous
vengeance
he
must
know
why
he
died
one
to
three
i
had
no
chance
but
if
i
knocked
openly
it
was
likely
that
being
my
patron
would
be
the
one
to
come
down
to
me
then
there
was
the
opportunity
man
to
man
if
it
were
grammont
or
the
lackey
i
would
boldly
declare
that
i
would
give
my
news
to
none
but
in
pursuance
of
this
plan
i
was
pounding
vigorously
on
the
door
when
a
voice
behind
me
cried
out
blithely
so
you
are
back
at
last
félix
broux
at
the
first
word
i
wheeled
around
in
the
court
entrance
stood
smiling
and
debonair
he
had
laid
aside
his
sword
and
held
on
his
left
arm
a
basket
containing
a
loaf
of
bread
a
roast
capon
and
some
bottles
for
all
the
world
like
an
honest
prentice
doing
his
master
errand
yes
i
am
back
i
shouted
back
to
kill
you
parricide
he
had
a
knife
in
his
belt
the
fight
was
even
i
was
upon
him
my
dagger
raised
to
strike
he
made
no
motion
to
draw
and
i
remembered
in
a
flash
he
could
not
his
right
arm
was
powerless
he
sprang
back
flinging
up
his
burdened
left
as
a
shield
and
my
blade
buried
itself
in
the
side
of
the
basket
as
i
stabbed
i
heard
feet
thundering
down
the
stairs
within
i
jerked
my
knife
from
the
wicker
and
turned
to
face
this
new
enemy
grammont
i
thought
and
that
my
end
had
come
the
door
flew
open
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
like
brothers
out
rushed
grammont
and
lucas
my
fear
was
drowned
in
amaze
i
forgot
to
run
and
stood
staring
in
sheer
blank
bewilderment
crying
damned
traitor
gervais
with
drawn
sword
charged
at
me
i
had
only
the
little
dagger
i
owe
my
life
to
quick
wits
and
no
less
quick
fingers
dropping
the
basket
he
snatched
a
bottle
from
it
and
hurled
it
at
gervais
ware
grammont
shouted
lucas
springing
forward
but
the
missile
flew
too
quickly
it
struck
grammont
square
on
the
forehead
and
he
went
down
like
a
slaughtered
ox
we
looked
not
at
him
but
at
lucas
lucas
the
duke
deferential
servant
the
coward
and
skulker
grammont
hatred
standing
here
by
grammont
side
glaring
at
us
over
his
naked
sword
i
saw
in
one
glance
that
was
no
less
astounded
than
i
and
from
that
instant
though
the
inwardness
of
the
matter
was
still
a
riddle
to
me
my
heart
acquitted
him
of
all
dishonesty
of
all
complicity
his
was
not
the
face
of
a
parricide
lucas
he
cried
in
a
dearth
of
words
i
was
staring
at
lucas
in
thick
bewilderment
the
man
was
transformed
from
the
one
i
knew
at
le
duc
he
had
been
pale
nervous
and
shaken
senselessly
and
contemptibly
scared
as
i
thought
since
he
was
warned
of
the
danger
and
need
not
face
it
but
now
he
was
another
man
i
can
think
only
of
those
lanterns
i
have
seen
set
with
coloured
glass
they
look
dull
enough
all
day
but
when
the
taper
within
is
lighted
shine
like
jewels
so
lucas
now
his
face
so
keen
and
handsome
of
feature
was
brilliant
his
eyes
sparkling
his
figure
instinct
with
defiance
a
smile
crossed
his
face
aye
he
answered
evenly
it
is
lucas
le
comte
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
stupor
he
could
not
for
a
space
find
his
tongue
to
demand
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
come
you
here
to
fight
grammont
lucas
answered
at
once
a
lie
i
shouted
you
grammont
friend
you
came
here
to
warn
him
off
it
your
plot
félix
the
plot
cried
the
plot
to
murder
monsieur
martin
let
it
out
i
thought
it
was
you
and
grammont
but
it
lucas
and
grammont
lucas
hesitated
even
now
he
debated
whether
he
could
not
lie
out
of
it
then
he
burst
into
laughter
it
seems
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
aye
le
comte
de
mar
i
came
to
warn
grammont
off
the
duke
will
be
here
straightway
how
will
you
like
to
swing
for
parricide
stared
at
him
neither
in
fear
nor
in
fury
but
in
utter
stupefaction
but
gervais
he
plotted
with
you
but
he
hates
you
we
gaped
at
lucas
like
yokels
at
a
conjurer
he
made
us
no
answer
but
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
the
alertness
of
an
angry
viper
we
were
two
but
without
swords
i
knew
he
was
thinking
how
easiest
to
end
us
both
le
comte
cried
you
you
come
from
navarre
camp
from
de
rosny
aye
i
have
outwitted
more
than
one
man
mordieu
i
was
right
to
hate
you
lucas
laughed
blazed
out
traitor
and
thief
you
stole
the
money
i
said
that
from
the
first
you
drove
us
from
the
house
how
you
and
grammont
came
together
very
simple
lucas
answered
with
easy
insolence
grammont
did
not
love
monsieur
your
honoured
father
it
was
play
to
make
an
assignation
with
him
and
to
lament
the
part
forced
on
me
by
monsieur
grammont
was
ready
enough
to
scent
a
scheme
of
le
to
ruin
him
he
had
said
as
much
to
monsieur
as
you
may
deign
to
remember
aye
said
le
comte
still
like
a
puzzled
child
he
was
angry
with
my
father
but
afterward
he
changed
his
mind
he
knew
it
was
you
and
only
you
lucas
broke
again
into
derisive
laughter
de
grammont
is
as
dull
a
dolt
as
ever
i
met
yet
clever
enough
to
gull
you
he
thought
you
must
suspect
i
dreaded
it
needlessly
you
wise
quentins
you
can
not
see
what
goes
on
under
your
very
nose
le
comte
sprang
forward
scarlet
lucas
flourished
the
sword
the
boy
there
caught
at
a
glance
what
you
had
not
found
out
in
a
fortnight
he
gets
to
the
duke
and
blocks
my
game
for
but
if
they
sent
him
ahead
to
hold
us
till
their
men
came
up
they
were
fools
too
i
have
the
duke
yet
and
i
have
you
now
he
rushed
at
the
unarmed
the
latter
darted
at
fallen
sword
seized
it
was
on
guard
all
in
the
second
before
lucas
reached
him
he
might
have
been
in
a
fortnight
trance
but
he
was
awake
at
last
i
trembled
for
him
then
took
heart
again
as
he
parried
thrust
after
thrust
and
pressed
lucas
hard
i
had
never
seen
a
man
fight
with
his
left
arm
before
i
had
not
realized
it
could
be
done
being
myself
helpless
with
that
hand
but
as
i
watched
this
combat
i
speedily
perceived
how
dangerous
is
a
adversary
in
later
years
i
was
to
understand
better
when
le
comte
had
become
known
the
length
of
the
land
by
the
title
le
gaucher
but
at
this
time
he
was
in
the
habit
like
the
rest
of
the
world
of
fencing
with
his
right
hand
his
dexterity
with
the
other
he
rated
only
as
a
pretty
accomplishment
to
surprise
the
crowd
he
used
his
left
hand
scarcely
as
well
as
lucas
the
right
yet
the
thrust
sinister
being
in
itself
a
strength
they
were
not
badly
matched
i
stood
watching
with
all
my
eyes
when
of
a
sudden
i
felt
a
grasp
on
my
ankle
and
the
next
instant
was
thrown
heavily
to
the
pavement
grammont
had
come
to
life
and
taken
prompt
part
in
the
fray
i
fell
close
to
him
and
instantly
he
let
go
my
leg
and
wound
his
arms
around
me
i
tried
to
rise
and
could
not
and
we
rolled
about
together
in
the
wine
and
blood
and
broken
glass
all
the
while
i
heard
the
clashing
god
be
thanked
seemed
to
be
holding
his
own
fighting
gervais
was
like
fighting
two
men
slowly
but
steadily
he
pressed
me
down
and
held
me
i
struggled
for
dear
life
and
could
not
push
him
back
an
inch
i
still
held
my
knife
but
my
arms
were
pinned
down
gervais
raised
himself
a
little
to
get
a
better
clutch
and
his
fingers
closed
on
my
throat
one
grip
and
life
seemed
flowing
from
me
my
arm
was
free
now
if
i
could
but
lift
it
if
i
could
not
nevermore
should
i
lift
it
on
this
sunny
earth
i
did
lift
it
and
drove
the
dagger
deep
into
him
i
could
not
take
aim
i
could
not
tell
where
the
knife
struck
a
gasp
showed
he
was
hit
then
he
clinched
my
throat
once
more
sight
went
from
me
and
hearing
it
is
no
use
i
thought
and
then
thought
went
too
but
once
again
the
saints
were
kind
to
me
the
blackness
passed
and
i
wondered
what
had
happened
that
i
was
spared
then
i
saw
grammont
clutching
with
both
hands
at
the
after
all
the
blow
had
gone
home
i
had
struck
him
in
the
left
side
under
the
arm
three
good
inches
of
steel
were
in
him
he
had
turned
over
on
his
side
half
off
me
i
scrambled
out
from
under
him
to
my
surprise
and
lucas
were
still
engaged
i
had
thought
it
hours
since
grammont
pulled
me
down
as
i
rose
turned
his
head
toward
me
only
for
a
second
but
in
that
second
lucas
pinked
his
shoulder
i
dashed
between
them
they
lowered
their
points
first
blood
for
me
cried
lucas
that
serves
for
le
comte
i
regret
that
i
can
not
wait
to
kill
you
but
that
will
come
it
is
necessary
that
i
go
before
le
duc
arrives
clear
the
way
le
comte
stood
his
ground
barring
the
alley
they
glared
at
each
other
motionless
grammont
had
raised
himself
to
his
knees
and
was
trying
painfully
to
get
on
his
feet
a
hand
lucas
he
gasped
lucas
gave
him
a
startled
glance
but
neither
went
nor
spoke
to
him
i
am
not
much
hurt
said
grammont
huskily
holding
by
the
wall
he
clambered
up
on
his
feet
he
swayed
reeled
forward
and
clutched
lucas
arm
lucas
lucas
help
me
draw
out
the
knife
i
can
not
i
shall
be
myself
when
the
knife
is
out
lucas
for
god
sake
you
will
die
when
the
knife
is
out
said
lucas
wrenching
himself
free
he
turned
again
to
le
comte
and
his
eyes
gleamed
as
he
saw
the
blood
trickling
down
his
sleeve
and
the
sword
tremble
in
his
hand
come
on
then
he
cried
to
but
i
sprang
forward
and
seized
the
sword
from
le
comte
hand
on
guard
i
shouted
and
we
went
to
work
i
could
handle
a
sword
as
well
as
the
next
one
le
duc
had
taught
me
in
his
idle
days
at
quentin
it
served
me
well
now
and
him
too
the
light
was
fading
in
the
narrow
court
our
blades
shone
white
in
the
twilight
as
the
weapons
clashed
in
and
out
i
saw
without
looking
grammont
leaning
against
the
wall
his
gory
face
ashen
and
watching
me
with
all
his
soul
now
and
then
shouting
a
word
of
advice
i
had
had
good
training
and
i
fought
for
all
there
was
in
me
yet
i
was
a
boy
not
come
to
my
full
strength
and
lucas
was
more
than
my
match
he
drove
me
back
farther
and
farther
toward
the
of
a
sudden
i
slipped
in
a
smear
of
blood
is
no
lying
excuse
i
did
slip
and
lost
my
guard
he
ran
his
blade
into
my
shoulder
as
he
had
done
with
he
would
likely
have
finished
me
had
not
a
cry
from
grammont
shaken
him
the
duke
in
truth
a
deepening
noise
of
hoofs
and
shouts
came
down
the
alley
from
the
street
lucas
looked
at
me
who
had
regained
my
guard
and
stood
little
hurt
between
him
and
le
comte
he
could
not
push
past
me
into
the
house
and
so
through
to
the
other
street
he
made
for
the
alley
crying
out
au
revoir
messieurs
we
shall
meet
again
grammont
seized
him
help
me
lucas
for
the
love
of
christ
do
leave
me
lucas
lucas
beat
him
off
with
the
sword
every
man
for
himself
he
cried
and
sprang
down
the
alley
it
is
not
the
duke
i
said
to
it
is
most
likely
the
watch
i
paled
at
the
thought
for
the
watch
was
the
league
and
lucas
by
all
signs
the
league
tool
it
might
go
hard
with
us
if
captured
go
through
the
house
le
comte
i
cried
quick
if
you
love
your
life
i
keep
them
at
the
alley
mouth
as
long
as
i
can
not
waiting
for
his
answer
i
rushed
down
the
passage
at
the
end
of
it
i
ran
against
lucas
who
in
his
turn
had
bowled
into
vigo
xi
i
knew
of
old
that
it
was
easier
to
catch
a
weasel
asleep
than
vigo
absent
where
he
was
needed
yet
i
did
not
expect
to
meet
him
in
the
alley
monsieur
then
had
changed
his
mind
well
caught
cried
vigo
winding
his
arms
round
lucas
who
was
struggling
furiously
for
liberty
here
maurice
jules
i
have
number
one
ah
you
young
sinner
with
your
crew
again
i
thought
as
much
tie
the
knots
hard
boys
better
be
quiet
you
snake
you
ca
get
away
lucas
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
to
this
for
he
quieted
down
directly
so
the
game
is
up
he
said
pleasantly
i
had
hoped
to
be
gone
before
you
arrived
dear
vigo
we
had
both
been
deprived
promptly
of
our
swords
and
lucas
wrists
were
roped
together
but
my
only
bond
was
vigo
hand
on
my
arm
where
are
the
others
he
demanded
no
tricks
now
here
i
said
and
led
the
way
down
the
passage
maurice
and
jules
with
their
prisoner
pressed
after
us
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
guard
after
them
the
rest
stayed
without
to
mind
the
horses
and
keep
off
the
gathering
crowd
one
of
the
men
had
a
torch
which
lighted
the
red
pavement
vigo
saw
this
first
morbleu
is
it
a
shambles
that
is
wine
i
said
they
spilled
wine
for
effect
they
spilled
so
little
blood
thus
lucas
speaking
with
as
cool
devilry
as
if
he
still
commanded
the
situation
vigo
could
not
know
what
he
meant
but
he
asked
no
questions
instead
bade
lucas
hold
his
tongue
i
am
dumb
lucas
rejoined
with
a
mock
meekness
more
insolent
than
insolence
but
we
paid
it
no
heed
for
le
comte
came
forward
out
of
the
shadows
he
held
his
head
well
up
but
his
face
was
white
above
his
crimsoned
doublet
étienne
are
you
hurt
shouted
vigo
no
but
he
is
le
comte
stepped
aside
to
show
us
grammont
leaning
against
the
wall
ah
cried
vigo
triumphantly
he
and
two
of
the
men
rushed
at
gervais
you
would
not
take
me
so
easily
but
for
a
cursed
knife
in
my
back
grammont
muttered
thickly
for
the
love
of
heaven
vigo
draw
it
out
with
amazement
vigo
perceived
the
knife
who
did
it
i
you
félix
in
the
back
vigo
looked
at
me
as
if
to
demand
again
which
side
i
was
on
he
lay
on
me
throttling
me
i
explained
i
stabbed
any
way
i
could
i
trow
you
are
a
dead
man
vigo
told
grammont
natheless
here
comes
the
knife
it
came
with
a
great
cry
from
the
victim
he
fell
back
against
man
clapping
his
hand
to
his
side
i
am
done
for
he
gasped
faintly
that
is
well
said
vigo
carefully
wiping
off
the
knife
yon
is
the
scoundrel
grammont
gasped
pointing
to
lucas
he
will
die
a
worse
death
than
you
said
vigo
grammont
looked
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
us
the
sullen
rage
in
his
face
fading
to
a
puzzled
helplessness
he
said
fretfully
which
which
is
étienne
he
could
no
longer
see
us
plain
le
comte
came
forward
silently
grammont
struggled
for
breath
in
a
way
pitiable
to
see
i
put
my
arm
about
him
and
helped
the
guardsman
to
hold
him
straighter
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
caught
at
le
comte
sleeve
étienne
étienne
pardon
it
was
wrong
toward
you
but
i
never
had
the
pistoles
he
called
me
thief
the
duke
i
beseech
your
pardon
le
comte
was
silent
it
was
all
lucas
lucas
did
it
grammont
muttered
with
stiffening
lips
i
am
sorry
for
it
i
am
dying
i
can
not
die
without
a
chance
say
you
for
give
still
le
comte
held
back
silent
treachery
was
no
less
treachery
though
grammont
was
dying
all
the
more
that
they
were
cousins
bedfellows
was
the
injury
great
to
forgive
le
comte
said
nothing
how
grammont
found
the
strength
only
god
knows
who
haply
in
his
goodness
gave
him
a
last
chance
of
mercy
suddenly
he
straightened
his
sinking
body
started
from
our
hold
and
tottered
toward
his
cousin
both
hands
outstretched
in
appeal
le
comte
face
was
set
like
a
flint
the
dying
man
faltered
forward
then
étienne
never
changing
his
countenance
slowly
half
reluctantly
like
a
man
in
a
dream
held
out
his
hand
but
the
old
comrades
estranged
by
traitory
were
never
to
clasp
again
as
he
reached
le
comte
grammont
fell
at
his
feet
he
was
a
strong
man
said
vigo
he
turned
grammont
face
up
and
added
the
word
dead
vigo
adored
the
duke
of
quentin
otherwise
he
had
no
emotions
but
i
was
not
and
i
i
myself
had
slain
this
man
who
had
died
slowly
and
in
great
pain
vigo
voice
sounded
to
me
far
off
as
he
said
bluntly
le
comte
i
make
you
my
prisoner
no
by
heaven
cried
étienne
in
a
vibrating
voice
that
brought
me
back
to
reality
no
vigo
i
am
no
murderer
things
may
look
black
against
me
but
i
am
innocent
you
have
one
villain
at
your
feet
and
one
a
prisoner
but
i
am
not
a
third
i
am
a
quentin
i
do
not
plot
against
my
father
i
was
to
aid
grammont
to
set
on
lucas
who
would
not
answer
a
challenge
i
have
been
tricked
gervais
asked
my
forgiveness
you
heard
him
their
dupe
yes
accomplice
i
was
not
never
have
i
lifted
my
hand
against
my
father
nor
would
i
whatever
came
that
i
swear
never
have
i
laid
eyes
on
lucas
since
i
left
monsieur
presence
till
now
when
he
came
out
of
that
door
side
by
side
with
grammont
whatever
the
plot
i
knew
naught
of
it
i
am
a
quentin
no
parricide
the
ringing
voice
ceased
and
le
comte
stood
silent
with
haggard
eyes
on
vigo
had
he
been
prisoner
at
the
bar
of
judgment
he
could
not
have
waited
in
greater
anxiety
for
vigo
the
yeoman
and
servant
never
minced
words
to
any
man
nor
swerved
from
the
stark
truth
i
burned
to
seize
vigo
arm
to
spur
him
on
to
speech
of
course
he
believed
étienne
how
dared
he
make
his
master
wait
for
the
assurance
on
his
knees
he
should
be
imploring
le
comte
pardon
but
no
thought
of
humbling
himself
troubled
vigo
nor
did
he
pronounce
judgment
but
merely
said
le
comte
will
go
home
with
me
now
he
can
tell
his
story
to
my
master
i
will
tell
it
before
this
hour
is
out
no
le
duc
has
left
paris
but
it
matters
not
étienne
monsieur
suspects
nothing
against
you
félix
kept
your
name
from
him
and
by
the
time
i
had
screwed
it
out
of
martin
monsieur
was
gone
gone
out
of
paris
étienne
echoed
blankly
to
his
eagerness
it
was
as
if
le
duc
were
out
of
france
aye
he
meant
to
go
monsieur
lucas
and
i
but
when
monsieur
learned
of
this
plot
he
swore
he
go
in
open
day
the
league
must
kill
me
says
he
can
do
it
in
daylight
with
all
paris
watching
that
monsieur
at
this
i
understood
how
vigo
came
to
be
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
monsieur
in
his
distress
and
anxiety
to
be
gone
from
that
unhappy
house
had
forgotten
the
spy
left
to
his
own
devices
the
equery
struck
with
suspicion
at
lucas
absence
laid
instant
hands
on
martin
the
clerk
with
whom
lucas
disliked
in
the
household
had
had
some
intimacy
it
had
not
occurred
to
vigo
that
le
comte
if
guilty
should
be
spared
at
once
he
had
sounded
boots
and
saddles
i
will
return
with
you
vigo
le
comte
said
does
the
meanest
lackey
in
my
father
house
call
me
parricide
i
must
meet
the
charge
my
father
and
i
have
differed
but
if
we
are
no
longer
friends
we
are
still
noblemen
i
could
never
plot
his
murder
nor
could
he
for
one
moment
believe
it
of
me
i
guilty
wretch
quailed
to
take
a
flogging
were
easier
than
to
confess
to
him
the
truth
but
i
conceived
i
must
monsieur
i
said
i
told
le
duc
you
were
guilty
i
went
back
a
second
time
and
told
him
and
he
cried
étienne
yes
monsieur
he
did
believe
it
morbleu
that
can
not
be
true
vigo
cried
for
when
i
saw
him
he
gave
no
sign
it
is
true
but
he
would
not
have
le
comte
touched
he
said
he
could
not
move
in
the
matter
he
could
not
punish
his
own
kin
le
comte
face
blazed
as
he
cried
out
vastly
magnanimous
i
thank
him
not
i
none
of
his
mercy
i
expected
his
faith
you
had
no
claim
to
it
le
comte
vigo
cried
the
young
noble
you
are
insolent
sirrah
i
cry
monsieur
pardon
he
was
quite
respectful
and
quite
unabashed
he
had
meant
no
insolence
but
étienne
had
dared
criticise
the
duke
and
that
vigo
did
not
allow
étienne
glared
at
him
in
speechless
wrath
it
would
have
liked
him
well
to
bring
this
contumelious
varlet
to
his
knees
but
how
it
was
a
byword
that
vigo
minded
no
man
ire
but
the
duke
the
king
of
france
could
not
dash
him
vigo
went
on
it
seems
i
have
exceeded
my
duty
monsieur
in
coming
here
yet
it
turns
out
for
the
best
since
lucas
is
caught
and
de
grammont
dead
and
you
cleared
of
suspicion
what
cried
what
you
call
me
cleared
vigo
looked
at
him
in
surprise
you
said
you
were
innocent
le
comte
le
comte
stared
without
a
word
to
answer
the
equery
all
unaware
of
having
said
anything
unexpected
turned
to
the
guardsman
maurice
well
is
lucas
trussed
have
you
searched
him
maurice
displayed
a
poniard
and
a
handful
of
small
coins
for
sole
booty
but
jules
made
haste
to
announce
he
has
something
else
though
a
paper
sewed
up
in
his
doublet
shall
i
rip
it
out
m
vigo
with
lucas
own
knife
the
grinning
jules
slashed
his
doublet
from
throat
to
thigh
to
extract
a
folded
paper
the
size
of
your
palm
vigo
pondered
the
superscription
slowly
not
much
at
home
with
the
work
of
a
quill
save
those
that
winged
arrows
étienne
coming
forward
with
a
sharp
exclamation
snatched
the
packet
how
came
you
by
my
letter
he
demanded
of
lucas
le
comte
was
pleased
to
consign
it
for
delivery
to
martin
what
purpose
had
you
with
it
rest
assured
dear
monsieur
i
had
a
purpose
the
questions
were
stormily
vehement
the
answers
so
gentle
as
to
be
fairly
caressing
it
was
waste
of
time
and
dignity
to
parley
with
the
scoundrel
till
one
could
back
one
queries
with
the
boot
but
étienne
passion
knew
no
waiting
thrusting
the
letter
into
his
breast
ere
i
who
had
edged
up
to
him
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
its
address
he
cried
upon
lucas
speak
you
were
ready
enough
to
jeer
at
me
for
a
dupe
tell
me
what
you
would
do
with
your
dupe
you
dared
not
open
the
plot
to
me
you
did
me
the
honour
to
know
i
would
not
kill
my
father
then
why
use
me
blindfold
an
awkward
game
lucas
lucas
disagreed
as
politely
as
if
exchanging
pleasantries
in
a
salon
a
dexterous
game
le
comte
your
best
friends
deemed
you
guilty
what
would
your
enemies
have
said
breathed
étienne
it
dawns
on
you
monsieur
you
are
marvellous
yet
surely
you
must
perceive
we
had
a
dozen
fellows
ready
to
swear
that
your
hand
killed
monsieur
you
would
kill
me
for
my
father
murder
ma
foi
no
cried
lucas
airily
never
in
the
world
we
should
have
let
you
live
in
the
knowledge
that
whenever
you
displeased
us
we
could
send
you
to
the
gallows
le
comte
silent
stared
at
him
with
wild
eyes
like
one
who
looks
into
the
open
roof
of
hell
lucas
fell
to
laughing
what
hang
you
and
let
our
cousin
valère
succeed
mon
dieu
no
de
valère
is
a
man
with
a
blow
the
guardsman
struck
the
words
and
the
laughter
from
his
lips
but
i
who
no
more
than
lucas
knew
how
to
hold
my
tongue
thought
i
saw
a
better
way
to
punish
this
brazen
knave
i
cried
out
you
are
the
dupe
lucas
aye
and
coward
to
boot
fleeing
here
from
nothing
i
knew
naught
against
you
you
saw
that
to
slip
out
and
warn
martin
before
vigo
got
a
chance
at
him
that
was
all
you
had
to
do
yet
you
never
thought
of
that
but
rushed
away
here
leaving
martin
to
betray
you
had
you
stuck
to
your
post
you
had
been
now
on
the
road
to
denis
instead
of
the
road
to
the
grève
fool
fool
fool
he
winced
he
had
not
been
ashamed
to
betray
his
benefactor
to
bite
the
hand
that
fed
him
to
desert
a
wounded
comrade
but
he
was
ashamed
to
confront
his
own
blunder
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
pricking
not
his
conscience
for
he
had
none
but
his
pride
i
had
to
warn
grammont
off
he
retorted
could
i
believe
quentin
such
a
as
to
forgive
these
two
because
they
were
his
kin
you
did
better
than
you
knew
when
you
shut
the
door
on
me
you
tracked
me
you
marplot
you
sneak
how
came
you
into
the
coil
by
god
grace
le
comte
answered
he
laid
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
leaned
there
heavily
lucas
grinned
ah
waxing
pious
is
he
the
prodigal
prepares
to
return
étienne
hand
clinched
on
my
shoulder
vigo
commanded
a
gag
for
lucas
saying
with
the
only
touch
of
anger
i
ever
knew
him
to
show
he
shall
hang
when
the
king
comes
in
and
now
to
horse
lads
and
out
of
the
quarter
we
have
wasted
too
much
time
palavering
king
henry
is
not
in
paris
yet
we
shall
do
well
not
to
rouse
belin
though
we
can
make
him
trouble
if
he
troubles
us
come
monsieur
men
guard
your
prisoner
i
misjudge
if
he
is
not
cropful
of
the
devil
still
he
did
not
look
it
his
figure
was
drooping
his
face
purple
and
contorted
for
one
of
the
troopers
had
crammed
his
scarf
into
the
mouth
half
strangling
him
as
he
was
led
past
us
with
a
sudden
frantic
effort
fit
to
dislocate
his
jaw
he
disgorged
the
gag
to
cry
out
wildly
oh
have
mercy
have
pity
upon
me
for
christ
sake
pity
illustration
in
a
flash
he
was
out
of
their
grasp
flying
down
the
alley
his
bravado
had
broken
down
at
last
he
tried
to
fling
himself
at
feet
the
guards
relaxed
their
hold
to
see
him
grovel
that
was
what
he
had
hoped
for
in
a
flash
he
was
out
of
their
grasp
flying
down
the
alley
to
vigo
vigo
is
attacked
we
heard
him
shout
it
was
so
quick
we
stood
dumfounded
and
then
we
dashed
after
tumbling
over
one
another
in
our
stampede
in
the
alley
we
ran
against
three
or
four
of
the
guard
answering
lucas
cry
we
lost
precious
seconds
disentangling
ourselves
and
shouting
that
it
was
a
ruse
and
our
prisoner
escaped
when
they
comprehended
we
all
rushed
together
out
of
the
passage
emerging
among
frightened
horses
and
a
great
press
of
excited
men
xii
comte
de
which
way
went
he
the
man
who
just
came
out
this
way
no
yonder
nay
i
saw
him
not
a
man
with
bound
hands
you
say
here
down
that
way
a
man
in
black
was
he
here
he
is
fool
no
he
went
that
way
étienne
vigo
i
and
the
guardsmen
rushed
hither
and
thither
into
the
crowd
shouting
after
lucas
and
exchanging
rapid
questions
with
every
one
we
passed
but
from
the
very
first
the
search
was
hopeless
it
was
dark
by
this
time
and
a
mass
of
people
blocked
the
street
surging
this
way
and
that
some
eagerly
joining
in
the
chase
others
from
ready
sympathy
with
any
rogue
doing
their
best
to
hinder
and
confuse
us
there
was
no
way
to
tell
how
he
had
gone
a
needle
in
a
haystack
is
easy
found
compared
with
him
who
loses
himself
in
a
paris
crowd
by
night
étienne
plunged
into
the
first
opening
he
saw
elbowing
his
way
manfully
i
followed
in
his
wake
his
tall
bright
head
making
as
good
an
oriflamme
as
the
king
plume
at
ivry
but
when
at
length
we
came
out
far
down
the
street
we
had
seen
no
trace
of
lucas
he
is
gone
said
le
comte
yes
monsieur
if
it
were
day
they
might
find
him
but
not
now
no
even
vigo
will
not
find
him
he
is
worsted
for
once
he
has
let
slip
the
shrewdest
knave
in
france
well
he
is
gone
he
repeated
after
a
minute
it
can
not
be
mended
by
me
he
is
off
and
so
am
i
whither
monsieur
that
is
my
concern
but
monsieur
will
see
le
duc
he
shook
his
head
but
monsieur
he
broke
in
on
me
fiercely
think
you
that
i
i
smirched
and
sullied
reeking
with
plots
of
murder
am
likely
to
betake
myself
to
the
noblest
gentleman
in
france
he
will
welcome
le
comte
nay
he
believed
me
guilty
but
monsieur
you
may
not
say
to
me
pardon
monsieur
am
i
to
tell
vigo
monsieur
is
gone
yes
tell
him
his
lip
quivered
he
struggled
hard
for
steadiness
you
will
go
to
le
duc
félix
and
rise
in
his
favour
for
it
was
you
saved
his
life
then
tell
him
this
from
me
that
some
day
when
i
have
made
me
worthy
to
enter
his
presence
then
will
i
go
to
him
and
beg
his
forgiveness
on
my
knees
and
now
farewell
he
slipped
away
into
the
darkness
i
stood
hesitating
for
a
moment
then
i
followed
my
lord
he
slackened
his
pace
as
he
heard
footsteps
overtake
him
and
where
a
beam
of
light
shone
out
from
an
open
door
he
wheeled
about
thinking
me
a
footpad
you
félix
yes
monsieur
i
go
with
le
comte
i
have
not
permitted
you
then
must
i
go
in
despite
monsieur
is
wounded
i
can
not
leave
him
to
go
unsquired
there
are
lackeys
to
hire
i
bade
you
seek
le
duc
is
not
monsieur
a
thought
unreasonable
i
can
not
be
in
two
places
at
once
monsieur
can
send
a
letter
the
duke
has
vigo
and
a
household
i
go
with
le
comte
oh
he
cried
you
are
a
faithful
servant
we
are
ridden
to
death
by
our
faithful
servants
we
quentins
myself
i
prefer
fleas
he
added
growing
angrier
will
you
leave
me
no
monsieur
said
i
he
glowered
at
me
and
i
think
he
had
some
notion
of
chasing
me
away
with
his
sword
but
since
his
dignity
could
not
so
stoop
he
growled
come
then
if
you
choose
to
come
unasked
and
most
unwelcome
with
this
he
walked
on
a
yard
ahead
of
me
never
turning
his
head
nor
saying
a
word
i
following
meekly
wondering
whither
and
devoutly
hoping
it
might
be
to
supper
presently
i
observed
that
we
were
in
a
better
quarter
of
the
town
and
before
long
we
came
to
a
broad
inn
whence
proceeded
a
merry
chatter
and
rattle
of
dice
étienne
with
accustomed
feet
turned
into
the
court
at
the
side
and
seizing
upon
a
drawer
who
was
crossing
from
door
to
door
despatched
him
for
the
landlord
mine
host
came
fat
and
smiling
unworried
by
the
hard
times
greeted
with
acclaim
as
this
dear
le
comte
wondered
at
his
long
absence
and
bloody
shirt
and
granted
with
all
alacrity
his
three
demands
of
a
supper
a
surgeon
and
a
bed
i
stood
back
ill
at
ease
aching
at
the
mention
of
supper
and
wondering
whether
i
were
to
be
driven
off
like
an
obtrusive
puppy
but
when
le
comte
without
glancing
at
me
said
to
the
drawer
take
care
of
my
i
knew
my
stomach
was
safe
that
was
the
most
i
thought
of
then
i
do
confess
for
except
for
my
sausage
i
had
not
tasted
food
since
morning
the
barber
came
and
bandaged
le
comte
and
put
him
straight
to
bed
and
i
was
left
free
to
fall
on
the
ample
victuals
set
before
me
and
was
so
comfortable
and
happy
that
the
rue
coupejarrets
seemed
like
an
evil
dream
since
that
day
i
have
been
an
easy
mark
for
beggars
if
they
could
but
manage
to
look
starved
presently
came
a
servant
to
say
that
my
bed
was
spread
in
le
room
and
ran
i
with
an
utterly
happy
heart
for
i
saw
by
this
token
that
i
was
forgiven
indeed
no
sooner
had
i
got
fairly
inside
the
door
than
my
master
raised
himself
on
his
sound
elbow
and
called
out
ah
félix
do
you
bear
me
malice
for
an
ungrateful
churl
i
bear
malice
i
cried
flushing
monsieur
is
mocking
me
i
know
monsieur
can
not
love
me
since
i
attempted
his
life
yet
my
wish
is
to
be
allowed
to
serve
him
so
faithfully
that
he
can
forget
it
nay
he
said
i
have
forgotten
it
and
it
was
freely
forgiven
from
the
moment
i
saw
lucas
at
my
cousin
side
for
the
second
time
i
said
monsieur
saved
my
life
and
i
dropped
on
my
knees
beside
the
bed
to
kiss
his
hand
but
he
snatched
it
away
from
me
and
flung
his
arm
around
my
neck
and
kissed
my
cheek
félix
he
cried
but
for
you
my
hands
would
be
red
with
my
blood
you
rescued
him
from
death
and
me
from
worse
if
i
have
any
shreds
of
honour
left
is
you
have
saved
them
to
me
monsieur
i
stammered
i
did
naught
i
am
your
servant
till
i
die
you
deserve
a
better
master
what
am
i
lucas
puppet
lucas
fool
monsieur
it
was
not
lucas
alone
it
was
a
plot
you
know
what
he
said
aye
he
cried
with
bitter
vehemence
i
shall
remember
for
some
time
what
he
said
they
would
not
kill
me
to
make
my
cousin
valère
duke
he
was
a
man
but
i
nom
de
dieu
i
was
not
worth
the
killing
it
is
the
league
scheming
monsieur
oh
that
does
not
need
the
saying
secretaries
do
plot
against
dukedoms
on
their
own
account
some
high
man
is
behind
lucas
i
dare
swear
his
grace
of
mayenne
himself
it
is
no
secret
now
where
monsieur
stands
yet
the
king
party
grows
so
strong
and
the
mob
so
cheers
monsieur
the
league
dare
not
strike
openly
so
they
put
a
spy
in
the
house
to
choose
time
and
way
and
the
spy
would
not
stab
for
he
saw
he
could
make
me
do
his
work
for
him
he
saw
i
needed
but
a
push
to
come
to
open
breach
with
my
father
he
gave
the
push
oh
he
could
make
me
pull
his
chestnuts
from
the
fire
well
enough
burning
my
hands
so
that
i
could
never
strike
a
free
blow
again
i
was
to
be
their
slave
their
thrall
forever
never
that
monsieur
never
that
i
am
not
so
sure
he
cried
had
it
not
been
for
the
advent
of
a
stray
boy
from
picardie
i
trow
lucas
would
have
put
his
purpose
through
i
was
blindfolded
i
saw
nothing
i
knew
my
cousin
gervais
to
be
morose
and
cruel
yet
i
had
done
him
no
harm
i
had
always
stood
his
friend
i
thought
him
shamefully
used
i
let
myself
be
turned
out
of
my
house
to
champion
him
i
had
no
more
notion
he
was
plotting
my
ruin
than
a
child
playing
with
his
dolls
i
was
their
doll
mordieu
their
toy
their
crazy
fool
on
a
chain
but
life
is
not
over
yet
i
go
to
pledge
my
sword
to
henry
of
navarre
monsieur
if
he
comes
to
the
faith
mordieu
faith
is
not
all
were
he
a
pagan
of
the
wilderness
he
were
better
than
these
leaguers
he
fights
honestly
and
bravely
and
generously
he
could
have
had
the
city
before
now
save
that
he
will
not
starve
us
he
looks
the
other
way
and
the
come
in
but
the
leaguers
with
all
their
regiments
dare
not
openly
strike
down
one
man
one
man
who
has
come
all
alone
into
their
country
they
put
a
spy
into
his
house
to
eat
his
bread
and
betray
him
they
stir
up
his
own
kin
to
slay
him
that
it
may
not
be
called
the
league
work
and
they
are
most
catholic
and
noble
gentlemen
nay
i
am
done
with
these
pious
plotters
who
would
redden
my
hands
with
my
father
blood
and
make
me
outcast
and
despised
of
all
men
i
have
spent
my
playtime
with
the
league
i
will
go
work
with
henry
of
navarre
i
caught
his
fire
by
quentin
i
cried
we
will
beat
these
leaguers
yet
he
laughed
yet
his
eyes
burned
with
determination
by
quentin
shall
we
you
and
i
félix
you
and
i
alone
will
overturn
the
whole
league
we
will
show
them
what
we
are
made
of
they
think
lightly
of
me
why
not
i
never
took
part
with
my
father
i
lazed
about
in
these
gay
paris
houses
bent
on
my
pleasure
too
shallow
a
fop
even
to
take
sides
in
the
fight
for
a
kingdom
what
should
they
see
in
me
but
an
roisterer
frittering
away
his
life
in
follies
but
they
will
find
i
am
something
more
well
enter
there
he
dropped
back
among
the
pillows
striving
to
look
careless
as
maître
menard
the
landlord
opened
the
door
and
stood
shuffling
on
the
threshold
does
le
comte
sleep
he
asked
me
deferentially
though
i
think
he
could
not
but
have
heard
étienne
tirading
down
the
passage
not
yet
i
answered
what
is
it
why
a
man
came
with
a
billet
for
le
comte
and
insisted
it
be
sent
in
i
told
him
monsieur
was
not
to
be
disturbed
he
had
been
wounded
and
was
sleeping
i
said
it
was
not
sense
to
wake
him
for
a
letter
that
would
keep
till
morning
but
he
would
have
it
was
of
instant
import
and
so
oh
he
is
not
asleep
i
declared
eagerly
ushering
the
maître
in
my
mind
leaping
to
the
conclusion
for
no
reason
save
my
ardent
wish
that
vigo
had
discovered
our
whereabouts
i
dared
not
deny
him
further
added
maître
menard
he
wore
the
liveries
of
de
mayenne
of
mayenne
i
echoed
thinking
of
what
étienne
had
said
pardieu
it
may
be
lucas
himself
and
snatching
up
my
master
sword
i
dashed
out
of
the
door
and
was
in
the
cabaret
in
three
steps
the
room
contained
some
score
of
men
but
i
peering
about
by
the
uncertain
could
find
no
one
who
in
any
wise
resembled
lucas
a
young
gamester
seated
near
the
door
whom
my
sudden
entrance
had
jostled
rose
demanding
in
the
name
of
his
outraged
dignity
to
cross
swords
with
me
on
any
other
day
i
had
deemed
it
impossible
to
say
him
nay
but
now
with
a
real
vengeance
a
quarrel
à
outrance
on
my
hands
he
seemed
of
no
consequence
at
all
i
brushed
him
aside
as
i
demanded
de
mayenne
man
they
said
he
was
gone
i
ran
out
into
the
dark
court
and
the
darker
street
a
tapster
lounging
in
the
courtyard
had
seen
my
man
pass
out
and
he
opined
with
much
reason
that
i
should
not
catch
him
yet
i
ran
a
hundred
yards
up
street
and
a
hundred
yards
down
street
shouting
on
the
name
of
lucas
calling
him
coward
and
skulker
bidding
him
come
forth
and
fight
me
the
whole
neighbourhood
became
aware
than
i
wanted
one
lucas
to
fight
lights
twinkled
in
windows
men
women
and
children
poured
out
of
doors
but
lucas
if
it
were
he
had
for
the
second
time
vanished
into
the
night
i
returned
with
drooping
tail
to
étienne
he
was
alone
sitting
up
in
bed
awaiting
me
his
cheeks
scarlet
his
eyes
blazing
he
is
gone
i
panted
i
looked
everywhere
but
he
was
gone
oh
if
i
caught
lucas
you
little
fool
he
exclaimed
this
was
not
lucas
had
you
waited
long
enough
to
hear
your
name
called
i
had
told
you
this
is
no
errand
of
lucas
but
a
very
different
matter
he
sat
a
moment
thinking
still
with
that
glitter
of
excitement
in
his
eyes
the
next
instant
he
threw
off
the
bedclothes
and
started
to
rise
get
my
clothes
félix
i
must
go
to
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
but
i
flung
myself
upon
him
pushing
him
back
into
bed
and
dragging
the
cover
over
him
by
main
force
you
can
go
nowhere
étienne
it
is
madness
the
surgeon
said
you
must
lie
here
for
three
days
you
will
get
a
fever
in
your
wounds
you
shall
not
go
get
off
me
rot
you
you
smothering
me
he
gasped
cautiously
i
relaxed
my
grip
still
holding
him
down
he
appealed
félix
i
must
go
so
long
as
there
is
a
spark
of
life
left
in
me
i
have
no
choice
but
to
go
monsieur
you
said
you
were
done
with
the
leaguers
with
de
mayenne
aye
so
i
did
he
cried
but
this
but
this
is
lorance
then
at
my
look
of
mystification
he
suddenly
opened
his
hand
and
tossed
me
the
letter
he
had
held
close
in
his
palm
i
read
de
mar
appears
to
consider
himself
of
very
little
consequence
or
of
very
great
since
he
is
absent
a
whole
month
from
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
does
he
think
he
is
not
missed
or
is
he
so
sure
of
his
standing
that
he
fears
no
supplanting
in
either
case
he
is
wrong
he
is
missed
but
he
will
not
be
missed
forever
he
may
if
he
will
be
forgiven
or
he
may
if
he
will
be
forgotten
if
he
would
escape
oblivion
let
him
come
at
the
eleventh
hour
to
lay
his
apologies
at
the
feet
lorance
de
montluc
and
she
is
cousin
and
ward
to
the
duke
of
mayenne
yes
and
my
heart
desire
monsieur
aye
you
begin
to
see
it
now
he
cried
vehemently
you
see
why
i
have
stuck
to
paris
these
three
years
why
i
could
not
follow
my
father
into
exile
it
was
more
than
a
handful
of
pistoles
caused
the
breach
with
monsieur
more
than
a
quarrel
over
gervais
de
grammont
that
was
the
spark
kindled
the
powder
but
the
train
was
laid
then
you
monsieur
were
a
leaguer
nay
i
was
not
he
cried
to
my
credit
or
my
shame
as
you
choose
i
was
not
i
was
neither
one
nor
the
other
neither
fish
nor
flesh
my
father
thought
me
a
leaguer
but
i
was
not
i
was
not
disloyal
in
deed
at
least
to
the
house
that
bore
me
monsieur
reviled
me
for
a
skulker
a
fainéant
nom
de
diable
he
might
have
remembered
his
own
three
years
of
idleness
monsieur
held
out
for
his
religion
mademoiselle
is
my
religion
he
cried
and
then
laughed
not
merrily
pardieu
for
all
my
pains
i
have
not
won
her
i
have
skulked
and
evaded
and
temporized
for
nothing
i
would
not
join
the
league
and
break
my
father
heart
would
not
stand
out
against
it
and
lose
lorance
i
have
been
trying
these
three
years
to
please
both
the
goat
and
the
cabbage
with
the
usual
ending
i
have
pleased
nobody
i
am
out
of
mayenne
books
he
made
me
overtures
and
i
refused
him
i
am
out
of
my
father
books
he
thinks
me
a
traitor
and
parricide
and
i
am
out
of
mademoiselle
she
despises
me
for
a
laggard
had
i
gone
in
with
mayenne
i
had
won
her
had
i
gone
with
monsieur
i
was
sure
of
a
command
in
king
henry
army
but
i
wanting
both
get
neither
between
two
stools
i
fall
miserably
to
the
ground
i
am
but
a
dawdler
a
the
butt
and
of
all
brave
men
but
i
am
done
with
he
added
catching
his
breath
for
once
i
shall
do
something
mlle
de
montluc
has
given
me
a
last
chance
she
has
sent
for
me
and
i
go
if
i
fall
dead
on
her
threshold
i
at
least
die
looking
at
her
monsieur
monsieur
i
cried
in
despair
you
will
not
die
looking
at
her
for
you
will
die
out
here
in
the
street
and
that
will
profit
neither
you
nor
her
but
only
lucas
and
his
crew
that
is
as
may
be
at
least
i
make
the
attempt
a
month
back
i
sent
her
a
letter
i
found
it
in
lucas
doublet
she
thinks
me
careless
of
her
i
must
go
monsieur
you
are
mad
i
cried
you
have
said
yourself
mayenne
is
likely
to
be
behind
lucas
if
you
go
you
do
but
walk
into
the
very
jaws
it
is
a
trap
a
lure
félix
beware
what
you
say
he
interrupted
with
ire
i
do
not
permit
such
words
to
be
spoken
in
connection
with
mlle
de
montluc
but
monsieur
silence
he
commanded
in
a
voice
as
sharp
as
crack
of
pistolet
the
quentins
had
ever
the
most
abundant
faith
in
those
they
loved
i
remembered
how
monsieur
in
just
such
a
blaze
of
resentment
had
forbidden
me
to
speak
ill
of
his
son
and
i
remembered
too
that
monsieur
faith
had
been
justified
and
that
my
accusations
were
lies
natheless
i
liked
not
the
look
of
this
affair
and
i
attempted
further
warnings
monsieur
in
my
opinion
you
are
not
here
to
hold
opinions
félix
but
your
tongue
i
did
at
that
and
stood
back
from
the
bed
to
let
him
do
as
it
liked
him
he
rose
and
went
over
to
the
chair
where
his
clothes
lay
only
to
drop
into
it
half
swooning
i
ran
to
the
ewer
and
dashed
half
the
water
in
it
into
his
face
peste
you
need
not
drown
me
he
cried
testily
i
am
well
it
was
but
a
moment
dizziness
he
got
up
again
at
once
but
was
forced
to
seize
my
shoulder
to
keep
from
falling
it
was
that
damnable
potion
he
made
me
drink
he
muttered
i
am
all
well
else
i
am
not
weak
curse
the
room
it
reels
about
like
a
ship
at
sea
i
put
my
arm
about
him
and
led
him
back
to
bed
nor
did
he
argue
about
it
but
lay
back
with
his
eyes
shut
so
white
against
the
white
i
thought
him
fainted
for
sure
but
before
i
could
drench
him
again
he
raised
his
lids
félix
will
you
go
get
a
shutter
for
i
see
clearly
that
i
shall
reach
mlle
de
montluc
this
night
in
no
other
way
monsieur
i
said
i
can
go
i
can
tell
your
mistress
you
can
not
walk
across
this
room
i
can
do
my
best
for
you
m
étienne
my
faith
i
think
i
must
let
you
try
but
what
to
bid
you
say
to
her
pardieu
i
scarce
know
what
i
could
say
to
her
myself
i
can
tell
her
how
sorely
you
are
hurt
how
you
would
come
but
can
not
and
make
her
believe
it
he
cried
eagerly
do
not
let
her
think
it
a
flimsy
excuse
and
yet
i
do
think
she
will
believe
you
he
added
with
half
a
laugh
there
is
something
very
about
you
félix
and
assure
her
of
my
lifelong
service
but
i
thought
monsieur
was
going
to
take
service
with
henry
of
navarre
i
was
he
cried
i
am
oh
félix
was
ever
a
poor
wight
so
harried
and
torn
betwixt
two
as
i
whom
jupiter
would
destroy
he
first
makes
mad
i
shall
be
gibbering
in
a
cage
before
i
have
done
with
it
monsieur
will
be
gibbering
in
his
bed
unless
he
sleeps
soon
i
go
now
monsieur
and
good
luck
to
you
félix
i
offer
you
no
reward
for
this
midnight
journey
into
the
house
of
our
enemies
for
recompense
you
will
see
her
xiii
i
went
to
find
maître
menard
to
urge
upon
him
that
some
one
should
stay
with
étienne
while
i
was
gone
lest
he
swooned
or
became
but
the
surgeon
himself
was
present
having
returned
from
bandaging
up
some
common
skull
to
see
how
his
noble
patient
rested
he
promised
that
he
would
stay
the
night
with
le
comte
so
eased
of
that
care
i
set
out
for
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
one
of
the
with
a
flambeau
coming
along
to
guide
and
guard
me
étienne
was
a
favourite
in
this
inn
of
maître
menard
they
did
not
stop
to
ask
whether
he
had
money
in
his
purse
before
falling
over
one
another
in
their
eagerness
to
serve
him
it
is
my
opinion
that
one
gets
more
out
of
the
world
by
dint
of
fair
words
than
by
a
long
purse
or
a
long
sword
we
had
not
gone
a
block
from
the
inn
before
i
turned
to
the
to
the
impatience
of
my
escort
nay
jean
i
must
go
back
i
said
i
will
only
delay
a
moment
but
see
maître
menard
i
must
he
was
still
in
the
cabaret
where
the
crowd
was
thinning
now
what
brings
you
back
this
maître
said
i
drawing
him
into
a
corner
le
comte
has
been
in
a
fracas
as
you
perchance
may
have
divined
his
gave
us
the
slip
and
i
am
not
easy
for
monsieur
while
this
lucas
is
at
large
he
has
the
devil
own
cunning
and
malice
he
might
track
him
here
to
the
three
lanterns
therefore
maître
i
beg
you
to
admit
no
one
to
le
comte
no
one
on
any
business
whatsoever
not
if
he
comes
from
the
duke
of
mayenne
himself
i
wo
admit
the
sixteen
themselves
the
maître
declared
there
is
one
man
you
may
admit
i
conceded
vigo
de
equery
you
will
know
him
for
the
biggest
man
in
france
good
and
this
other
what
is
he
like
he
is
young
i
said
not
above
four
or
five
and
twenty
tall
and
slim
oh
without
doubt
a
gentleman
he
has
hair
and
thin
aquiline
face
his
tongue
is
unbound
too
his
tongue
shall
not
get
around
me
maître
menard
promised
the
host
of
the
three
lanterns
was
not
born
yesterday
let
me
tell
you
with
this
comforting
assurance
i
set
out
once
more
on
my
expedition
with
to
tell
truth
no
very
keen
enthusiasm
for
the
business
it
was
all
very
well
for
étienne
to
declare
grandly
that
as
recompense
for
my
trouble
i
should
see
mlle
de
montluc
but
i
was
not
her
lover
and
i
thought
i
could
get
along
very
comfortably
without
seeing
her
i
knew
not
how
to
bear
myself
before
a
splendid
young
noblewoman
when
i
had
dashed
across
paris
to
slay
the
traitor
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
i
had
not
been
afraid
but
now
going
with
a
to
a
girl
i
was
scared
and
there
was
more
than
the
fear
of
her
bright
eyes
to
give
me
pause
i
was
afraid
of
mlle
de
montluc
but
more
afraid
of
de
cousin
what
mocking
devil
had
driven
étienne
de
mar
out
of
a
whole
france
full
of
lovely
women
to
fix
his
unturnable
desire
on
this
ligueuse
of
mayenne
own
brood
had
his
father
friends
no
daughters
that
he
must
seek
a
mistress
from
the
black
duke
household
were
there
no
families
of
clean
hands
and
honest
speech
that
he
must
ally
himself
with
the
treacherous
blood
of
lorraine
i
had
seen
a
sample
of
the
league
work
and
i
liked
it
not
if
mayenne
were
as
surmised
lucas
backer
i
marvelled
that
my
master
cared
to
enter
his
house
i
marvelled
that
he
cared
to
send
his
servant
there
yet
i
went
none
the
less
readily
for
that
i
was
here
to
do
his
bidding
nor
was
i
greatly
alarmed
for
my
own
skin
i
thought
myself
too
small
to
be
worth
my
lord
mayenne
powder
and
i
had
i
do
confess
a
lively
curiosity
to
behold
the
interior
of
the
greatest
house
in
paris
the
very
core
and
centre
of
the
league
belike
if
it
had
not
been
for
terror
of
this
young
demoiselle
i
had
stepped
along
cheerfully
enough
though
the
hour
was
late
many
people
still
loitered
in
the
streets
the
clear
summer
night
and
all
of
them
were
talking
politics
as
jean
and
i
passed
at
a
rapid
pace
the
groups
under
the
lanterns
we
caught
always
the
names
of
mayenne
and
navarre
everywhere
they
asked
the
same
two
questions
was
it
true
that
henry
was
coming
into
the
church
and
if
so
what
would
mayenne
do
next
i
perceived
that
old
maître
jacques
of
the
amour
de
dieu
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
the
people
of
paris
were
sick
to
death
of
the
leagues
and
their
intriguery
galled
to
desperation
under
the
yoke
of
the
sixteen
mayenne
fine
new
hôtel
in
the
rue
antoine
was
lighted
as
for
a
fête
from
its
open
windows
came
sounds
of
gay
laughter
and
rattling
dice
you
might
have
thought
them
keeping
carnival
in
the
midst
of
a
happy
and
loyal
city
if
the
found
anything
to
vex
him
in
the
present
situation
he
did
not
let
the
commonalty
know
it
the
duke
of
mayenne
house
like
my
duke
was
guarded
by
but
his
grilles
were
thrown
back
while
his
soldiers
lounged
on
the
stone
benches
in
the
archway
some
of
them
were
talking
to
a
little
knot
of
street
idlers
who
had
gathered
about
the
entrance
while
others
with
the
aid
of
a
torch
and
a
greasy
pack
of
cards
were
playing
lansquenet
i
knew
no
way
to
do
but
to
ask
openly
for
mlle
de
montluc
declaring
that
i
came
on
behalf
of
the
comte
de
mar
that
is
right
you
are
to
enter
the
captain
of
the
guard
replied
at
once
but
you
are
not
the
comte
de
mar
yourself
nay
no
need
to
ask
he
added
with
a
laugh
a
pretty
count
you
would
make
i
am
his
servant
i
said
i
am
charged
with
a
message
for
mademoiselle
well
my
orders
were
to
admit
the
count
but
i
suppose
you
may
go
in
if
mademoiselle
can
not
land
her
lover
it
were
cruel
to
deny
her
the
consolation
of
a
message
a
laugh
went
up
and
one
of
the
gamblers
looked
round
to
say
it
has
gone
hard
with
mademoiselle
lately
sangdieu
here
the
comte
de
mar
has
not
set
foot
in
the
house
for
a
month
or
more
and
paul
for
a
quarter
of
a
year
is
vanished
off
the
face
of
the
earth
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
take
the
little
cheese
or
nothing
but
now
things
are
looking
up
with
her
paul
has
walked
calmly
in
and
here
is
a
messenger
at
least
from
the
other
but
paul
has
walked
calmly
out
again
a
third
soldier
took
up
the
tale
he
did
not
stay
very
long
for
all
mademoiselle
graces
then
i
warrant
was
mademoiselle
sent
him
off
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
another
cried
she
looks
higher
than
a
bastard
even
le
own
she
had
better
take
care
how
she
flouts
paul
de
lorraine
came
the
retort
but
the
captain
bade
me
march
along
i
followed
him
into
the
house
leaving
jean
to
be
edified
no
doubt
by
a
whole
history
false
and
true
concerning
mlle
de
montluc
we
bow
down
before
the
lofty
of
the
earth
we
underlings
but
behind
their
backs
there
is
none
with
whose
names
we
make
so
free
and
there
we
have
the
advantage
of
our
masters
for
they
know
little
of
our
private
matters
while
we
know
everything
of
theirs
in
the
hall
the
captain
turned
me
over
to
a
lackey
who
conducted
me
through
a
couple
of
antechambers
to
a
curtained
doorway
whence
issued
a
merry
confusion
of
voices
and
laughter
he
passed
in
while
i
remained
to
undergo
the
scrutiny
of
the
pair
of
flunkies
whose
repose
we
had
invaded
but
in
a
moment
my
guide
appeared
again
lifting
the
curtain
for
me
to
enter
the
big
room
was
ablaze
with
candles
set
in
mirrored
sconces
along
the
walls
set
also
in
silver
candelabra
on
the
tables
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
in
the
place
a
hundred
it
seemed
to
my
dazzled
eyes
grouped
most
of
them
about
the
tables
set
up
and
down
either
taking
hands
themselves
at
cards
or
dice
or
betting
on
those
who
did
bluff
soldiers
in
breastplate
and
were
not
wanting
in
the
throng
but
the
larger
number
of
the
gallants
were
brave
in
silken
doublets
and
spotless
ruffs
as
became
a
noble
and
the
ladies
mordieu
what
am
i
to
say
of
them
tricked
out
in
every
gay
colour
under
the
sun
agleam
with
jewels
eh
bien
the
ladies
of
quentin
that
i
had
thought
so
fine
were
but
to
these
i
stood
blinking
dazed
by
the
lights
and
the
crowd
and
the
chatter
unable
in
the
first
moment
to
note
clearly
any
face
in
the
congregation
of
strange
countenances
nor
would
it
have
helped
me
if
i
could
for
here
close
about
were
a
dozen
fair
women
any
one
of
whom
might
be
mlle
de
montluc
my
heart
hammered
in
my
throat
i
knew
not
whom
to
address
but
a
young
noble
near
by
dazzling
in
a
suit
of
pink
took
the
burden
on
himself
i
heard
mar
name
yet
you
are
not
de
mar
i
think
he
spoke
with
a
languid
but
none
the
less
teasing
derision
in
truth
i
must
have
resembled
a
little
brown
hare
suddenly
turned
out
of
a
bag
in
the
midst
of
that
gorgeous
company
no
i
stammered
i
am
his
servant
i
seek
mlle
de
montluc
i
have
wondered
what
has
become
of
étienne
de
mar
this
last
month
spoke
a
second
young
gentleman
advancing
from
his
place
behind
a
fair
one
chair
he
was
neither
so
pretty
nor
so
fine
as
the
other
but
in
his
short
stocky
figure
and
square
face
there
was
a
force
which
his
comrade
lacked
he
regarded
me
with
a
far
keener
glance
as
he
asked
peste
he
must
be
in
low
water
if
this
is
the
best
he
can
do
for
a
lackey
perhaps
the
fellow
errand
is
to
beg
an
advance
from
mlle
de
montluc
suggested
the
pink
youth
who
speaks
my
name
a
clear
voice
called
and
a
lady
laying
down
her
hand
at
cards
rose
and
came
toward
me
she
was
clad
in
amber
satin
she
was
tall
and
she
carried
herself
with
stately
grace
her
black
hair
shadowed
a
cheek
as
purely
white
and
pink
as
that
of
any
frisian
girl
while
her
eyes
under
their
sooty
lashes
shone
blue
as
i
began
to
understand
étienne
who
is
it
wants
me
she
repeated
and
catching
sight
of
me
stood
regarding
me
in
some
surprise
not
unfriendly
waiting
for
me
to
explain
myself
but
before
i
could
find
my
tongue
the
man
in
pink
answered
her
with
his
soft
drawl
mademoiselle
this
is
a
minister
plenipotentiary
and
envoy
extraordinary
most
extraordinary
from
the
court
of
his
highness
the
comte
de
mar
oh
that
is
it
she
cried
with
a
little
laugh
but
not
i
think
at
my
uncouthness
though
she
looked
me
over
curiously
he
has
not
come
himself
de
mar
it
appears
not
mademoiselle
she
did
not
seem
vastly
disconcerted
for
all
she
cried
in
doleful
tones
alack
alack
i
have
lost
and
paul
is
not
present
to
enjoy
his
triumph
he
wagered
me
a
pair
of
gloves
that
i
could
not
produce
de
mar
but
it
is
not
his
fault
i
answered
her
eagerly
it
is
not
de
mar
fault
mademoiselle
he
has
been
hurt
and
he
could
not
come
he
is
in
bed
of
his
wounds
he
could
not
walk
across
his
room
he
tried
he
bade
me
lay
at
mademoiselle
feet
his
lifelong
services
ah
lorance
cried
a
young
demoiselle
in
a
gown
methinks
you
have
indeed
lost
de
mar
if
he
sends
you
no
better
messenger
of
his
regrets
than
this
i
have
lost
the
gloves
that
is
certain
and
sad
mlle
de
montluc
replied
as
if
the
loss
of
the
wager
were
all
her
care
i
am
punished
for
my
vanity
mesdames
et
messieurs
i
undertook
to
produce
my
recreant
squire
and
i
have
failed
alas
and
she
put
up
her
white
hands
before
her
face
with
a
pretty
imitation
of
despair
save
that
her
eyes
sparkled
from
between
her
fingers
by
this
time
the
gamesters
about
us
had
stopped
their
play
in
a
general
interest
in
the
affair
an
older
lady
coming
forward
with
an
air
of
authority
demanded
what
is
this
disturbance
lorance
a
wager
between
me
and
my
cousin
paul
madame
she
answered
with
instant
gravity
and
respect
paul
de
lorraine
is
he
here
the
other
asked
unpleased
i
thought
yes
madame
he
dropped
from
the
skies
on
us
this
afternoon
he
is
out
of
the
house
again
now
but
while
he
was
in
the
house
quoth
she
in
though
he
did
not
find
time
to
pay
his
respects
to
mme
la
duchesse
he
had
the
leisure
for
considerable
conversation
with
mlle
de
montluc
the
other
lady
whom
i
now
guessed
to
be
the
duchesse
de
mayenne
herself
turned
somewhat
sharply
on
her
cousin
of
montluc
i
do
not
yet
hear
your
excuses
mademoiselle
for
the
introduction
of
a
into
my
salon
i
beg
you
to
believe
madame
i
am
not
responsible
for
it
she
protested
paul
when
he
was
here
saw
fit
to
rally
me
concerning
de
mar
mlle
de
tavanne
informed
him
of
the
count
defection
and
they
were
pleased
to
be
merry
with
me
over
it
i
vowed
i
could
get
him
back
if
i
wished
the
end
of
the
matter
was
that
i
wrote
a
letter
which
my
cousin
promised
to
have
conveyed
to
le
comte
old
lodgings
this
is
the
answer
mademoiselle
cried
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
toward
me
but
i
did
not
expect
it
in
this
guise
madame
blame
your
lackeys
who
know
not
their
duties
not
me
i
blame
you
mademoiselle
mme
de
mayenne
answered
her
tartly
i
consider
my
salon
no
place
for
intrigues
with
if
you
must
hold
colloquy
with
this
fellow
take
him
whither
he
belongs
to
the
stables
a
laugh
went
up
among
those
who
laugh
at
whatever
a
duchess
says
come
mesdames
we
will
resume
our
play
she
added
to
the
ladies
who
had
followed
her
on
the
scene
and
turned
her
back
in
lofty
disdain
on
mlle
de
montluc
and
her
concerns
but
though
some
of
the
company
obeyed
her
a
curious
circle
still
surrounded
us
dame
if
you
must
be
banished
to
the
stables
we
all
will
go
mademoiselle
declared
the
pink
gallant
we
all
want
news
of
the
vanished
mar
indeed
we
do
we
have
missed
him
sorely
and
i
dare
swear
this
messenger
account
will
prove
diverting
lisped
the
demoiselle
i
was
not
enjoying
myself
i
had
given
all
my
hopes
of
glory
to
be
out
in
the
street
again
i
wished
mlle
de
montluc
would
take
me
to
the
stables
anywhere
out
of
this
laughing
company
but
she
had
no
such
intent
i
think
madame
does
not
mean
her
sentence
she
rejoined
i
would
not
for
the
world
frustrate
your
curiosity
blanche
nor
yours
de
champfleury
tell
us
what
has
befallen
your
master
sir
courier
he
has
been
in
a
duel
mademoiselle
whom
was
he
fighting
and
for
what
lady
favour
is
it
a
pretty
huguenot
this
time
does
she
make
him
read
his
bible
or
did
her
big
brother
set
on
him
for
a
wicked
papist
the
questions
chorussed
upon
me
i
saw
they
were
framed
to
tease
mademoiselle
i
answered
as
best
i
might
he
thinks
of
no
lady
but
mlle
de
montluc
the
fight
was
over
other
matters
i
am
only
told
to
say
le
comte
regrets
most
heartily
that
his
wound
prevents
his
coming
and
to
assure
mademoiselle
that
he
is
too
weak
and
faint
to
walk
across
the
floor
then
exceed
your
instructions
a
little
tell
us
what
monsieur
has
been
about
these
four
weeks
that
he
could
not
take
time
to
visit
us
i
was
in
a
dilemma
i
knew
she
was
étienne
chosen
lady
and
therefore
deserving
of
all
fealty
from
me
yet
at
the
same
time
i
could
not
answer
her
question
it
was
sheer
embarrassment
and
no
intent
of
rudeness
that
caused
my
short
answer
about
his
own
concerns
mademoiselle
the
young
puppy
begins
to
growl
exclaimed
the
soldierly
fellow
who
had
bespoken
me
before
whose
hostile
gaze
had
never
left
my
face
i
have
him
flogged
mademoiselle
for
this
insolence
de
brie
she
began
at
the
same
moment
that
i
cried
out
to
her
i
meant
no
insolence
i
crave
mademoiselle
pardon
i
added
in
my
haste
floundering
deeper
into
the
mire
mademoiselle
sees
for
herself
that
i
can
not
tell
about
le
comte
affairs
in
this
house
brie
had
me
by
the
collar
so
that
is
what
has
become
of
mar
he
cried
triumphantly
i
thought
as
much
if
mar
affairs
are
to
be
a
secret
from
this
house
then
nom
de
dieu
they
are
no
secret
he
shook
me
back
and
forth
as
if
to
shake
the
truth
out
of
me
till
my
teeth
rattled
together
i
could
not
have
spoken
if
i
would
but
he
cried
on
his
voice
rising
with
excitement
it
has
been
no
secret
where
quentin
stands
and
what
he
has
been
about
he
came
into
paris
smooth
and
smiling
his
own
man
forsooth
neither
ours
nor
the
heretic
mordieu
he
was
henry
fast
and
sure
save
that
he
was
not
man
enough
to
say
so
i
told
mayenne
last
month
we
ought
to
settle
with
de
quentin
i
asked
nothing
better
than
to
attend
to
him
but
the
general
would
not
but
let
him
alone
free
and
unmolested
in
his
work
of
stirring
up
sedition
and
mar
too
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
word
all
the
company
who
had
been
pressing
around
us
halted
still
i
knew
that
behind
me
some
one
had
entered
the
room
de
brie
dragged
me
back
from
where
we
were
blocking
the
passage
i
turned
in
his
grasp
to
face
the
newcomer
he
was
a
tall
stout
man
his
wavy
hair
brushed
up
from
a
high
forehead
was
lightest
brown
while
his
brows
mustachios
and
beard
were
dark
his
eyes
were
dark
also
his
full
lips
red
and
smiling
he
had
the
beauty
and
presence
of
all
the
guises
it
needed
not
the
star
on
his
breast
to
tell
me
that
this
was
mayenne
himself
he
advanced
into
the
room
returning
the
salutes
of
the
company
but
his
glance
travelling
straight
to
me
and
my
captor
what
have
we
here
françois
this
is
a
fellow
of
étienne
de
mar
le
duc
brie
answered
he
came
here
with
messages
for
mlle
de
montluc
i
am
getting
out
of
him
what
mar
has
been
up
to
since
he
disappeared
a
month
back
you
are
at
unnecessary
pains
my
dear
françois
i
already
know
whereabouts
and
doings
rather
better
than
he
knows
them
himself
brie
dropped
his
hand
from
my
collar
looking
by
no
means
at
ease
i
perceived
that
this
was
the
way
with
mayenne
you
knew
what
he
said
but
you
did
not
know
what
he
thought
his
somewhat
heavy
face
varied
little
what
went
on
in
his
mind
behind
the
smiling
mask
was
matter
for
anxiety
if
he
asked
pleasantly
after
your
health
you
fancied
he
might
be
thinking
how
well
you
would
grace
the
gallows
de
brie
said
nothing
and
the
duke
continued
yes
i
have
kept
watch
over
him
these
five
weeks
you
are
late
françois
you
little
boys
are
fools
you
think
because
you
do
not
know
a
thing
i
do
not
know
it
was
i
cruel
to
keep
my
information
from
you
ma
belle
lorance
the
attack
was
absolutely
sudden
he
had
not
seemed
to
observe
her
mademoiselle
coloured
and
made
no
instant
reply
his
voice
was
neither
loud
nor
rough
he
was
smiling
upon
her
or
did
you
need
no
information
mademoiselle
she
met
his
look
unflinching
i
have
not
been
sighing
for
tidings
of
the
comte
de
mar
monsieur
because
you
have
had
tidings
mademoiselle
no
monsieur
i
have
had
no
communication
with
de
mar
since
may
until
and
what
has
happened
paul
appeared
paul
ejaculated
the
duke
startled
momentarily
out
of
his
phlegm
paul
here
he
was
monsieur
an
hour
ago
he
has
since
gone
forth
again
i
know
not
whither
or
for
what
mayenne
ruminated
over
this
pulling
off
his
gloves
slowly
well
what
has
this
to
do
with
mar
she
had
no
choice
though
in
evident
fear
of
his
displeasure
but
to
go
through
again
the
tale
of
the
wager
and
letter
she
was
moistening
her
dry
lips
as
she
finished
her
eyes
on
his
face
wide
with
apprehension
but
he
answered
amiably
half
absently
as
if
the
whole
affair
were
a
triviality
never
mind
i
will
give
you
a
pair
of
gloves
lorance
he
stood
smiling
upon
us
as
if
amused
for
an
idle
moment
over
our
childish
games
the
colour
came
back
to
her
cheeks
she
made
him
a
curtsey
laughing
lightly
then
my
grief
is
indeed
cured
monsieur
a
new
bit
of
finery
is
the
best
of
balms
for
wounded
is
it
not
blanche
i
confess
i
am
piqued
i
had
dared
to
imagine
that
my
squire
might
remember
me
still
after
a
month
of
absence
i
should
have
known
it
too
much
to
ask
of
mortal
man
not
till
the
rivers
run
will
you
keep
our
memories
green
for
more
than
a
week
messieurs
she
turns
it
off
well
cried
the
little
demoiselle
in
blue
mlle
blanche
de
tavanne
you
would
not
guess
that
she
will
be
awake
the
night
long
weeping
over
de
mar
defection
i
exclaimed
mlle
de
montluc
i
weep
over
his
recreancy
it
is
a
jest
my
blanche
can
you
invent
no
better
the
comte
de
mar
behold
him
she
snatched
a
card
from
a
hand
holding
it
up
aloft
for
us
all
to
see
it
was
by
chance
the
knave
of
diamonds
the
pictured
face
with
its
yellow
hair
bore
in
my
fancy
at
least
a
suggestion
of
étienne
behold
de
mar
behold
his
fate
with
a
twinkling
of
her
white
fingers
she
had
torn
the
luckless
knave
into
a
dozen
pieces
and
sent
them
whirling
over
her
head
to
fall
far
and
wide
among
the
company
illustration
i
do
not
forgive
his
despatching
me
his
summary
measures
mademoiselle
quoth
a
grizzled
warrior
with
a
laugh
mordieu
have
we
your
good
permission
to
deal
likewise
with
the
mar
when
we
go
to
arrest
him
for
conspiring
against
the
holy
league
but
mlle
de
tavanne
quick
tongue
robbed
him
of
his
answer
marry
you
are
severe
on
him
lorance
to
be
sure
he
does
not
come
himself
but
he
sends
so
gallant
a
messenger
mademoiselle
glanced
at
me
with
hard
blue
eyes
that
is
the
greatest
insult
of
all
she
said
i
could
forgive
and
forget
his
absence
but
i
do
not
forgive
his
despatching
me
his
thus
far
i
had
choked
down
my
swelling
rage
at
her
faithlessness
her
vanity
her
despiteful
entreatment
of
my
master
plight
i
knew
it
was
sheer
madness
for
me
to
attempt
his
defence
before
this
hostile
company
nay
there
was
no
object
in
defending
him
there
was
not
one
here
who
cared
to
hear
good
of
him
but
at
her
last
insult
to
him
my
blood
boiled
so
hot
that
i
lost
all
command
of
myself
and
i
burst
out
if
i
were
a
which
i
am
not
i
were
twenty
times
too
good
to
be
carrying
messages
hither
you
need
not
rail
at
his
poverty
mademoiselle
it
was
you
brought
him
to
it
it
was
for
you
he
was
turned
out
of
his
father
house
but
for
you
he
would
not
now
be
lying
in
a
garret
penniless
and
dishonoured
whatever
ills
he
suffers
it
is
you
and
your
false
house
have
brought
them
brie
had
me
by
the
throat
mayenne
interfered
without
excitement
do
strangle
him
françois
i
may
need
him
later
let
him
be
flogged
and
locked
in
the
oratory
he
turned
away
as
one
bored
over
a
trifling
matter
and
as
the
lackeys
dragged
me
back
to
the
door
i
heard
mlle
de
montluc
saying
oh
de
latour
what
have
i
done
in
destroying
your
knave
of
diamonds
ma
foi
you
had
a
quatorze
xiv

head
lackey
here
a
candidate
for
a
hiding
this
is
a
cub
of
that
fellow
mar
he
reckoned
wrong
when
he
brought
his
insolence
into
this
house
lay
on
well
boys
make
him
howl
brie
would
have
liked
well
enough
i
fancy
to
come
along
and
see
the
fun
but
he
conceived
that
his
duty
lay
in
the
salon
pierre
the
same
who
had
conducted
me
to
mlle
de
montluc
now
led
the
way
into
a
long
parlour
opposite
the
entrance
was
a
huge
chimney
carved
with
the
arms
of
lorraine
at
one
end
a
door
led
into
a
little
oratory
where
tapers
burned
before
the
image
of
the
virgin
at
the
other
before
the
two
narrow
windows
stood
a
long
table
with
chests
and
cupboards
nearly
filled
the
walls
i
took
this
to
be
a
sort
of
of
my
lord
mayenne
pierre
sent
one
of
his
men
for
a
cane
and
to
the
other
suggested
that
he
should
quench
the
virgin
candles
for
i
do
see
why
this
rascal
should
have
the
comfort
of
a
light
in
there
he
said
as
for
madonna
mary
she
will
not
mind
she
has
a
million
others
to
see
by
i
was
left
alone
with
him
and
i
promised
myself
the
joy
of
one
good
blow
at
his
face
no
matter
how
deep
they
flayed
me
for
it
but
as
i
gathered
myself
for
the
rush
he
spoke
to
me
low
and
cautiously
now
howl
your
loudest
lad
and
i
not
lay
on
too
hard
my
clinched
fist
dropped
to
my
side
you
never
did
me
any
harm
he
muttered
howl
till
they
think
you
half
killed
and
i
manage
i
gaped
at
him
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
it
but
this
is
the
way
of
the
world
if
there
is
much
cruelty
in
it
there
is
much
kindness
too
here
the
cane
nom
chien
pierre
exclaimed
boisterously
give
it
here
jean
there
not
be
much
of
it
left
when
i
get
through
you
strip
his
coat
off
said
the
second
lackey
from
the
oratory
my
faith
no
i
should
kill
him
if
i
did
and
the
duke
wants
him
pierre
retorted
so
without
more
ado
the
two
men
tied
my
wrists
in
front
of
me
and
jean
held
me
by
the
knot
while
pierre
laid
on
and
he
good
fellow
grasping
my
collar
contrived
to
pull
my
loose
jerkin
away
from
my
back
so
that
he
dusted
it
down
without
greatly
incommoding
me
some
hard
whacks
i
did
get
but
they
were
nothing
to
what
a
strong
man
could
have
given
in
grim
earnest
i
trust
i
could
have
taken
a
real
flogging
with
as
close
lips
as
anybody
but
if
my
kind
succourer
wanted
howls
howls
he
should
have
i
yelled
and
cowered
and
dodged
about
to
the
roaring
delight
of
jean
and
his
mate
indeed
i
had
drawn
a
crowd
of
grinning
varlets
to
the
door
before
my
performance
was
over
but
at
length
when
i
thought
i
had
done
enough
for
their
pleasure
and
that
of
the
nobles
in
the
salon
i
dropped
down
on
the
floor
and
lay
quiet
with
shut
eyes
he
has
had
his
fill
i
trow
we
must
not
spoil
him
for
the
master
pierre
said
oh
he
come
to
in
a
minute
another
answered
why
you
have
not
even
drawn
blood
pierre
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
back
whereat
i
groaned
my
hollowest
it
will
be
many
a
day
before
he
cares
to
have
his
back
touched
laughed
pierre
here
men
lend
a
hand
pardieu
i
wonder
what
our
lady
thinks
of
some
of
the
devotees
we
bring
her
as
they
lifted
me
he
took
my
hand
with
an
inquiring
squeeze
and
i
squeezed
back
grateful
if
ever
a
boy
was
they
flung
me
down
on
the
oratory
floor
and
left
me
there
a
prisoner
i
spent
the
next
hour
or
so
trying
to
undo
the
knot
of
my
handcuff
with
my
teeth
and
failing
that
to
chew
the
stout
rope
in
two
i
was
minded
as
i
worked
of
lucas
and
his
bonds
and
wondered
whether
he
had
managed
to
rid
himself
of
their
inconvenience
he
went
straightway
doubtless
to
some
confederate
who
cut
them
for
him
and
even
now
was
planning
fresh
evil
against
the
quentins
i
remembered
his
face
as
he
cried
to
le
comte
that
they
should
meet
again
and
i
thought
that
étienne
was
likely
to
have
his
hands
full
with
lucas
without
this
unlucky
tanglement
with
mlle
de
montluc
in
the
darkness
and
solitude
i
called
down
a
murrain
on
his
folly
why
could
he
not
leave
the
girl
alone
there
were
other
blue
eyes
in
the
world
and
it
would
be
hard
on
humanity
if
there
were
none
kindlier
he
had
been
at
it
three
years
too
for
three
long
years
this
fair
face
had
stood
between
him
and
his
home
between
him
and
action
between
him
and
happiness
it
was
a
fair
face
truly
yet
in
my
opinion
neither
it
nor
any
maid
was
worth
such
pains
if
she
had
loved
him
it
had
not
been
worth
it
but
this
girl
spurned
and
flouted
him
why
in
the
name
of
heaven
could
he
not
put
the
jade
out
of
his
mind
and
turn
merrily
to
denis
and
the
road
to
glory
when
i
got
back
to
him
and
told
him
how
she
had
mocked
him
hang
me
but
he
should
though
ah
but
when
was
i
to
get
back
to
him
that
rested
not
with
me
but
with
my
dangerous
host
the
league
mayenne
what
he
wanted
with
me
he
had
not
revealed
nor
was
it
a
pleasant
subject
for
speculation
he
meant
me
of
course
to
tell
him
all
i
knew
of
the
quentins
well
that
was
soon
done
belike
he
understood
more
than
i
of
the
day
work
but
after
he
had
questioned
me
what
would
he
consider
with
his
servant
pierre
that
i
had
never
done
him
any
harm
or
would
he
i
wondered
if
they
flung
me
out
stark
into
some
alley
gutter
whether
le
comte
would
search
for
me
and
claim
my
carcass
or
would
he
too
have
fallen
by
the
blades
of
the
league
i
was
shuddering
as
i
waited
there
in
the
darkness
never
not
even
this
morning
in
the
closet
of
the
rue
coupejarrets
had
i
been
in
such
mortal
dread
i
had
walked
out
of
that
closet
to
find
étienne
but
i
was
not
likely
to
happen
on
succour
here
pierre
for
all
his
kind
heart
could
not
save
me
from
the
duke
of
mayenne
then
when
my
hope
was
at
its
nadir
i
remembered
who
was
with
me
in
the
little
room
i
groped
my
way
to
our
lady
feet
and
prayed
her
to
save
me
and
if
she
might
not
then
to
stand
by
me
during
the
hard
moment
of
dying
and
receive
my
seeking
soul
comforted
now
and
deeming
i
could
pass
if
it
came
to
that
with
a
steady
face
i
laid
me
down
my
head
on
the
cushion
and
presently
went
to
sleep
i
was
waked
by
a
light
in
my
face
and
all
sprang
up
to
meet
my
doom
but
it
was
not
the
duke
or
any
of
his
hirelings
who
bent
over
me
candle
in
hand
it
was
mlle
de
montluc
oh
my
boy
my
poor
boy
she
cried
pitifully
i
could
not
save
you
the
flogging
on
my
honour
i
could
not
it
would
have
availed
you
nothing
had
i
pleaded
for
you
on
my
bended
knees
with
bewilderment
i
observed
that
the
tears
were
brimming
over
her
lashes
and
splashing
down
into
the
i
stared
too
confused
for
speech
while
she
putting
down
the
shaking
candlestick
on
the
altar
as
she
crossed
herself
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
sobbing
mademoiselle
i
stammered
it
is
not
worth
mademoiselle
tears
the
man
pierre
he
told
me
to
scream
so
they
would
think
he
was
half
flaying
me
but
in
truth
he
did
not
strike
very
hard
he
did
not
hurt
so
much
she
struggled
to
check
the
rising
tempest
of
her
tears
and
presently
dropped
her
hands
and
looked
at
me
earnestly
from
out
her
shining
wet
eyes
is
that
true
are
you
not
flayed
and
to
make
sure
she
laid
her
hand
delicately
on
my
back
they
have
whacked
your
coat
to
ribbons
but
thank
généviève
they
have
not
brought
the
blood
i
saw
a
man
flogged
once
she
shut
her
eyes
shuddering
and
her
mouth
quivered
anew
but
i
am
not
much
hurt
mademoiselle
i
answered
her
she
took
out
her
film
of
a
handkerchief
to
wipe
her
wet
cheeks
her
hand
still
trembling
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
to
repeat
i
am
not
in
the
least
hurt
mademoiselle
ah
but
if
they
have
spared
you
the
flogging
to
take
your
life
she
breathed
it
was
not
a
heartening
suggestion
to
my
astonishment
suddenly
i
found
myself
frightened
victim
striving
to
comfort
this
noblewoman
for
my
death
nay
i
am
not
afraid
since
mademoiselle
weeps
over
me
i
can
die
happily
she
sprang
toward
me
as
if
to
protect
me
with
her
body
from
some
menacing
thrust
they
shall
not
kill
you
she
cried
her
eyes
flashing
blue
fire
they
shall
not
mon
dieu
is
lorance
de
montluc
so
feeble
a
thing
that
she
can
not
save
a
she
fell
back
a
pace
pressing
her
hands
to
her
temples
as
if
to
stifle
their
throbbing
it
was
my
fault
she
cried
it
was
all
my
fault
it
was
my
vanity
and
silliness
brought
you
to
this
i
should
never
have
written
that
letter
a
three
years
child
would
have
known
better
but
i
had
not
seen
de
mar
for
five
weeks
i
did
not
know
what
i
readily
guess
now
that
he
had
taken
sides
against
us
de
lorraine
played
on
my
pique
mademoiselle
i
said
the
worst
has
not
followed
since
étienne
did
not
come
himself
you
are
glad
for
that
why
of
course
mademoiselle
was
it
not
a
trap
for
him
she
caught
her
breath
as
if
in
pain
i
knew
that
as
soon
as
i
saw
that
my
cousin
mayenne
was
not
angry
when
i
told
what
i
had
done
and
he
smiled
at
me
and
said
i
should
have
my
gloves
why
then
i
thought
my
heart
would
stop
beating
i
saw
what
i
had
accomplished
mon
dieu
i
was
sick
with
repentance
of
it
i
had
to
tell
her
i
had
not
thought
it
no
she
answered
i
had
got
you
into
this
by
my
foolishness
i
must
needs
try
to
get
you
out
by
my
wits
brie
the
one
who
took
you
by
the
throat
there
has
been
bad
blood
between
him
and
your
lord
this
twelvemonth
only
last
may
le
comte
ran
him
through
the
wrist
had
i
interfered
for
you
she
said
colouring
a
little
de
brie
would
have
inferred
interest
in
the
master
from
that
in
the
man
and
he
had
seen
to
your
beating
himself
it
suddenly
dawned
on
me
that
this
de
brie
was
the
little
cheese
of
gossip
and
i
thought
that
the
gentleman
would
hardly
display
so
much
venom
against
étienne
unless
he
were
a
serious
obstacle
to
his
hopes
nor
would
mademoiselle
be
here
at
midnight
weeping
over
a
if
she
cared
nothing
for
the
master
if
she
had
not
worn
her
heart
on
her
sleeve
before
the
laughing
salon
mayhap
she
would
show
it
to
me
mademoiselle
i
cried
when
the
billet
was
brought
him
étienne
rose
from
his
bed
at
once
to
come
but
he
was
faint
from
fatigue
and
loss
of
blood
he
could
not
walk
across
the
room
but
he
bade
me
try
to
make
mademoiselle
believe
his
absence
was
no
fault
of
his
he
wrote
her
a
month
ago
he
found
the
letter
was
never
delivered
is
he
hurt
dangerously
no
i
admitted
reluctantly
no
i
think
not
he
was
wounded
in
the
right
forearm
and
again
pinked
in
the
shoulder
but
he
will
recover
you
said
she
went
on
the
tears
standing
in
her
eyes
that
he
was
penniless
i
have
not
much
but
what
i
have
is
freely
his
she
advanced
upon
me
holding
out
her
silken
purse
which
she
had
taken
from
her
bosom
but
i
retreated
no
no
mademoiselle
i
cried
ashamed
of
my
hot
words
we
are
not
penniless
or
if
we
are
we
get
on
very
well
sans
le
sou
they
do
everything
for
monsieur
at
the
trois
lanternes
and
he
has
only
to
return
to
the
hôtel
quentin
to
get
all
the
gold
pieces
he
can
spend
oh
no
we
are
in
no
want
mademoiselle
i
was
angry
when
i
said
it
i
did
not
mean
it
i
cry
mademoiselle
pardon
she
looked
at
me
a
little
hesitatingly
you
are
telling
me
true
why
yes
mademoiselle
if
my
monsieur
needed
money
indeed
indeed
i
would
not
refuse
it
then
if
you
can
not
take
it
for
him
you
can
take
it
for
yourself
it
will
be
strange
if
in
all
paris
you
can
not
find
something
you
like
as
a
token
from
me
with
her
own
white
fingers
she
slipped
some
tinkling
coins
into
my
pouch
and
cut
short
my
thanks
with
the
little
wailing
cry
oh
your
poor
bound
hands
i
have
my
poniard
in
my
dress
i
could
free
them
in
a
second
but
if
they
knew
i
had
been
here
with
you
they
never
will
let
you
go
if
mademoiselle
is
running
into
danger
staying
here
i
pray
her
to
go
back
to
bed
étienne
did
not
send
me
hither
to
bring
her
grief
and
trouble
who
are
you
she
asked
me
abruptly
you
have
never
been
here
before
on
monsieur
errands
no
mademoiselle
i
came
up
only
yesterday
from
picardie
i
belong
on
the
quentin
estate
my
name
is
félix
broux
alack
you
have
chosen
a
bad
time
to
visit
paris
i
came
up
to
see
life
i
said
and
mordieu
i
am
seeing
it
i
pray
god
you
may
not
see
death
too
she
answered
soberly
she
stood
looking
at
me
helplessly
i
am
in
my
lord
black
books
she
said
slowly
as
if
to
herself
but
i
might
weep
françois
de
brie
rough
heart
to
softness
then
it
is
a
question
whether
he
could
turn
mayenne
i
wish
i
knew
whether
the
duke
himself
or
only
paul
de
lorraine
has
planned
this
move
that
is
she
added
blushing
but
speaking
out
candidly
whether
they
attack
de
mar
as
the
league
enemy
or
as
my
lover
this
paul
de
lorraine
said
i
speaking
as
respectfully
as
i
knew
how
but
eager
to
find
out
all
i
could
for
étienne
this
de
lorraine
is
mademoiselle
lover
too
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
neither
assenting
nor
denying
we
are
all
pawns
in
the
game
for
de
mayenne
to
push
about
as
he
chooses
for
a
time
de
mar
was
high
in
his
favour
then
my
cousin
paul
came
back
after
a
two
years
disappearance
and
straightway
he
was
up
and
de
mar
was
down
and
then
paul
vanished
again
as
suddenly
as
he
had
come
and
it
became
the
turn
of
de
brie
now
paul
walked
in
as
suddenly
as
he
had
left
and
at
once
played
on
me
to
write
that
unlucky
letter
and
what
it
bodes
for
i
know
not
she
spoke
with
amazing
frankness
yet
much
as
she
had
told
me
the
fact
of
her
telling
it
told
me
even
more
i
saw
that
she
was
as
lonely
in
this
great
house
as
i
had
been
at
quentin
she
would
have
talked
delightedly
to
le
comte
dog
mademoiselle
i
said
i
would
like
well
to
tell
you
what
has
been
happening
to
my
étienne
this
last
month
if
you
are
not
afraid
to
stay
long
enough
to
hear
it
oh
every
one
is
asleep
long
ago
it
is
past
two
yes
you
may
tell
me
if
you
wish
she
sat
down
on
a
motioning
me
to
the
other
and
i
began
my
tale
at
first
she
listened
with
a
little
air
of
languor
as
if
the
whole
were
of
slight
consequence
and
she
really
did
not
care
at
all
what
le
comte
had
been
about
these
five
weeks
but
as
i
got
into
the
affair
of
the
rue
coupejarrets
she
forgot
her
indifference
and
leaned
forward
with
burning
cheeks
hanging
on
my
words
with
eager
questions
and
when
i
told
her
how
lucas
had
evaded
us
in
the
darkness
she
cried
blessed
virgin
de
mar
has
enough
to
contend
with
in
this
lucas
without
paul
de
lorraine
and
brie
and
the
duke
of
mayenne
himself
i
was
silent
being
of
her
opinion
presently
she
asked
reluctantly
does
your
master
think
this
lucas
a
tool
of
de
mayenne
yes
mademoiselle
he
says
secretaries
do
not
plot
against
dukedoms
for
their
own
pleasure
asassination
was
not
wont
to
be
my
cousin
mayenne
way
she
said
with
an
accent
of
confidence
that
rang
as
false
as
a
counterfeit
coin
i
saw
well
enough
that
mademoiselle
did
fear
at
least
mayenne
guilt
i
thought
i
might
tell
her
a
little
more
le
comte
told
me
that
since
his
father
coming
to
paris
de
mayenne
made
him
offers
to
join
the
league
and
he
refused
them
so
then
de
mayenne
seeing
himself
losing
the
whole
house
of
quentin
invented
this
but
it
failed
thank
god
it
failed
and
now
he
will
leave
paris
he
will
he
must
he
did
mean
to
seek
navarre
camp
i
answered
but
but
what
but
then
the
letter
came
but
that
makes
no
difference
he
must
go
for
all
that
the
time
is
over
for
trimming
he
must
stand
on
one
side
or
the
other
i
am
a
ligueuse
born
and
bred
and
i
tell
him
to
go
to
king
henry
it
is
his
side
it
is
his
side
he
can
not
stay
in
paris
another
day
i
do
not
think
he
will
go
mademoiselle
but
he
must
she
cried
with
vehemence
paris
is
not
safe
for
him
if
he
can
not
stand
for
his
wound
he
must
go
i
will
send
him
a
letter
myself
to
tell
him
he
must
then
he
will
never
go
félix
he
will
not
he
was
going
because
he
thought
his
lady
flouted
him
when
he
finds
she
does
not
well
if
he
budges
a
step
out
of
paris
i
do
not
know
him
when
he
thought
himself
despised
and
why
did
i
turn
his
suit
into
laughter
in
the
salon
if
i
did
not
mean
that
i
despised
him
i
did
it
for
you
to
tell
him
how
i
made
a
mock
of
him
that
he
might
hate
me
and
keep
away
from
me
oh
i
said
mademoiselle
is
beyond
me
i
can
not
keep
up
with
her
and
you
believed
it
but
you
must
needs
spoil
all
by
flaring
out
with
impudent
speech
i
crave
mademoiselle
pardon
i
was
wrong
and
insolent
but
she
played
too
well
and
if
it
was
not
play
she
cried
rising
if
i
do
well
i
will
not
say
despise
him
but
care
nothing
for
him
will
he
then
go
to
denis
then
tell
him
from
me
that
he
has
my
pity
as
one
cruelly
cozened
and
my
esteem
as
a
servant
of
mine
but
never
my
love
tell
him
i
would
willingly
save
him
alive
for
the
sake
of
the
love
he
once
bore
me
but
as
for
any
answering
love
in
my
bosom
i
have
not
one
spark
tell
him
to
go
find
a
new
mistress
at
denis
he
might
as
well
cry
for
the
moon
as
seek
to
win
lorance
de
montluc
that
may
be
true
i
said
but
all
the
same
he
will
try
can
mademoiselle
suppose
he
will
go
out
of
paris
now
and
leave
her
to
marry
brie
and
lorraine
only
one
she
protested
with
the
shadow
of
a
smile
and
then
a
sudden
rush
of
tears
blinded
her
i
am
a
very
miserable
girl
she
said
woefully
for
i
bring
nothing
but
danger
to
those
that
love
me
i
dropped
on
my
knees
before
her
and
kissed
the
hem
of
her
dress
ah
félix
she
said
if
you
really
pitied
me
you
would
get
him
out
of
paris
and
she
fell
to
weeping
as
if
her
heart
would
break
i
had
no
skill
to
comfort
her
i
bent
my
head
before
her
silent
at
length
she
sobbed
out
it
boots
little
for
us
to
quarrel
over
what
you
shall
say
to
de
mar
when
we
know
not
that
you
will
ever
speak
to
him
again
and
it
was
all
my
fault
mademoiselle
it
was
the
fault
of
my
hasty
tongue
but
she
shook
her
head
i
maintained
that
to
you
but
it
was
not
true
mayenne
had
something
in
his
mind
before
a
general
holds
his
schemes
so
dear
and
lives
so
cheap
but
i
will
do
my
utmost
félix
lad
it
is
not
long
to
daylight
now
i
will
go
to
françois
de
brie
and
we
believe
i
shall
prevail
she
took
up
her
candle
and
said
good
night
to
me
very
gently
and
quietly
and
gave
me
her
hand
to
kiss
she
opened
the
door
with
my
fettered
wrists
i
could
not
do
the
office
for
her
and
on
the
threshold
turned
to
smile
on
me
wistfully
hopefully
in
the
next
second
with
a
gasp
that
was
half
a
cry
she
blew
out
the
light
and
pushed
the
door
shut
again
xv
lord
i
knew
she
was
shutting
the
door
by
the
click
of
the
latch
in
the
next
second
i
made
the
discovery
that
she
was
still
on
my
side
of
it
what
i
was
beginning
when
she
laid
her
hand
over
my
mouth
a
line
of
light
showed
through
the
crack
she
had
not
quite
closed
the
door
on
account
of
the
noise
of
the
latch
she
tried
again
again
it
rattled
and
she
desisted
i
heard
her
fluttered
breathing
and
i
heard
something
else
a
rapid
heavy
tread
in
the
corridor
without
into
the
came
a
man
carrying
a
lighted
taper
it
was
mayenne
mademoiselle
with
a
whispered
god
save
us
sank
in
a
heap
at
my
feet
i
bent
over
her
to
find
if
she
had
swooned
when
she
seized
my
hand
in
a
sharp
grip
that
told
me
plain
as
words
to
be
quiet
mayenne
was
yawning
he
had
a
rumpled
and
dishevelled
look
like
one
just
roused
from
sleep
he
crossed
over
to
the
table
lighted
the
candlestick
standing
there
and
seated
himself
with
his
back
to
us
pulling
about
some
papers
i
hardly
dared
glance
at
him
for
fear
my
eyes
should
draw
his
the
crack
of
our
door
seemed
to
call
aloud
to
him
to
mark
it
but
the
scarcely
pierced
the
shadows
of
the
long
room
more
quick
footsteps
in
the
corridor
mayenne
hitched
his
chair
about
sidewise
to
the
table
and
to
us
facing
the
outer
door
a
tall
man
in
black
entered
saluting
the
general
from
the
threshold
so
you
have
come
back
spoke
the
duke
in
his
even
tones
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
words
were
a
welcome
or
a
sentence
yes
answered
the
other
in
a
voice
as
noncommittal
as
mayenne
own
he
shut
the
door
after
him
and
walked
over
to
the
table
and
how
goes
it
badly
the
newcomer
threw
his
hat
aside
and
sat
down
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
what
badly
sirrah
mayenne
exclaimed
sharply
you
come
to
me
with
that
report
i
do
monsieur
answered
the
other
with
cool
insolence
leaning
back
in
his
chair
the
light
fell
directly
on
his
face
and
proved
to
me
what
i
had
guessed
at
his
first
word
the
duke
night
visitor
was
lucas
yes
he
repeated
indifferently
it
has
gone
badly
in
fact
your
game
is
up
mayenne
jumped
to
his
feet
bringing
his
fist
down
on
the
table
you
tell
me
this
lucas
regarded
him
with
an
easy
smile
unfortunately
monsieur
i
do
illustration
mlle
de
montluc
and
félix
broux
in
the
oratory
mayenne
turned
on
him
cursing
lucas
with
the
quickness
of
a
cat
sprang
a
yard
aside
dagger
unsheathed
put
up
that
knife
shouted
mayenne
when
you
put
up
yours
monsieur
i
have
drawn
none
in
your
sleeve
monsieur
liar
cried
mayenne
i
know
not
who
was
lying
for
i
could
not
tell
whether
the
blade
that
flashed
now
in
the
duke
hand
came
from
his
sleeve
or
from
his
belt
but
if
he
had
not
drawn
before
he
had
drawn
now
and
rushed
at
lucas
he
dodged
and
they
circled
round
each
other
wary
as
two
matched
cocks
lucas
was
strictly
on
the
defensive
mayenne
the
less
agile
by
reason
of
his
weight
could
make
no
chance
to
strike
he
drew
off
presently
i
have
your
neck
wrung
for
this
he
panted
for
what
monsieur
asked
lucas
imperturbably
for
defending
myself
mayenne
let
the
charge
go
by
default
for
coming
to
me
with
the
tale
of
your
failures
nom
de
dieu
do
i
employ
you
to
fail
we
are
none
of
us
gods
monsieur
you
yourself
lost
ivry
mayenne
backed
over
to
his
chair
and
seated
himself
laying
his
knife
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
his
face
smoothed
out
to
good
humour
no
mean
tribute
to
his
power
of
for
the
written
words
can
convey
no
notion
of
the
maddening
insolence
of
lucas
bearing
an
insolence
so
studied
that
it
almost
seemed
unconscious
and
was
thereby
impossible
to
silence
sit
down
bade
the
duke
and
tell
me
lucas
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
table
observed
they
turned
you
out
of
your
bed
monsieur
to
see
me
it
was
unnecessary
severity
my
tale
will
keep
till
morning
by
heaven
it
shall
not
mayenne
shouted
beware
how
much
further
you
dare
anger
me
you
satan
cub
he
was
fingering
the
dagger
again
as
if
he
longed
to
plunge
it
into
lucas
gullet
and
i
rather
marvelled
that
he
did
not
or
summon
his
guard
to
do
it
for
i
could
well
understand
how
infuriating
was
lucas
he
carried
himself
with
an
air
of
easy
equality
insufferable
to
the
first
noble
in
the
land
mayenne
chosen
rôle
was
the
unmoved
the
inscrutable
but
lucas
beat
him
at
his
own
game
and
drove
him
out
into
the
open
of
passion
and
violence
it
was
a
miracle
to
me
that
the
man
lived
unless
indeed
he
were
a
prince
in
disguise
satan
cub
lucas
repeated
laughing
our
late
king
had
called
me
that
pardieu
but
i
knew
not
you
acknowledged
satan
in
the
family
i
ordered
antoine
to
wake
me
if
you
returned
in
the
night
mayenne
went
on
gruffly
when
i
heard
you
had
been
here
i
knew
something
was
wrong
unless
the
thing
were
done
it
is
not
done
the
whole
plot
is
ruined
nom
de
dieu
if
it
is
by
your
bungling
it
was
not
by
my
bungling
lucas
answered
with
the
first
touch
of
heat
he
had
shown
it
was
fate
and
that
fool
grammont
explain
then
and
quickly
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
you
lucas
sat
down
the
table
between
them
look
here
he
said
abruptly
leaning
forward
over
the
board
have
you
mar
boy
what
boy
a
young
picard
from
the
quentin
estate
whom
the
devil
prompted
to
come
up
to
town
mar
sent
him
here
with
a
to
lorance
oh
said
mayenne
slowly
if
it
is
a
question
of
it
may
be
put
off
till
it
is
plain
to
the
very
lackeys
that
you
are
jealous
of
mar
but
at
present
we
are
discussing
st
quentin
it
is
all
one
lucas
answered
quickly
you
know
what
is
to
be
the
reward
of
my
success
i
thought
you
told
me
you
had
failed
lucas
hand
moved
instinctively
to
his
belt
then
he
thought
better
of
it
and
laid
both
hands
empty
on
the
table
our
plot
has
failed
but
that
does
not
mean
that
quentin
is
immortal
you
may
be
very
sure
of
one
thing
my
friend
the
duke
observed
i
shall
never
give
lorance
de
montluc
to
a
flincher
the
duke
of
quentin
is
not
immortal
lucas
repeated
i
have
missed
him
once
but
i
shall
get
him
in
spite
of
all
i
am
not
sure
about
lorance
even
then
said
mayenne
reflectively
françois
de
brie
is
agitating
himself
about
that
young
mistress
and
he
has
not
made
any
failures
as
yet
lucas
sprang
to
his
feet
you
swore
to
me
i
should
have
her
permit
me
to
remind
you
again
that
you
have
not
brought
me
the
price
i
will
bring
you
the
price
then
spoke
mayenne
with
the
smile
of
the
cat
standing
over
the
mouse
then
i
might
change
my
mind
then
said
lucas
roundly
there
will
be
more
than
one
dead
duke
in
france
mayenne
looked
up
at
him
as
unmoved
as
if
it
were
not
in
the
power
of
mortal
man
to
make
him
lose
his
temper
in
stirring
him
to
draw
dagger
lucas
had
achieved
an
extraordinary
triumph
yet
i
somehow
thought
that
the
man
who
had
shown
hot
anger
was
the
real
man
the
man
who
sat
there
quiet
was
the
party
leader
he
said
now
evenly
that
is
a
silly
way
to
talk
to
me
paul
it
is
the
truth
for
once
lucas
made
sullen
answer
so
long
as
he
could
prick
and
irritate
mayenne
he
preserved
an
air
of
unshakable
composure
but
when
mayenne
recovered
patience
and
himself
began
to
prick
lucas
guard
broke
down
his
voice
rose
a
key
as
it
had
done
when
i
called
him
fool
and
he
burst
out
violently
mort
de
dieu
monsieur
what
am
i
doing
your
dirty
work
for
for
love
of
my
affectionate
uncle
it
might
well
be
for
that
i
have
been
your
affectionate
uncle
as
you
say
my
affectionate
uncle
you
say
my
hirer
my
suborner
i
was
a
protestant
i
was
bred
up
by
the
huguenot
lucases
when
my
father
cast
off
my
mother
and
me
to
starve
i
had
no
love
for
the
league
or
the
lorraines
i
was
fighting
in
navarre
ranks
when
i
was
made
prisoner
at
ivry
you
were
spying
for
navarre
it
was
before
the
fight
we
caught
you
you
had
been
hanged
and
quartered
in
that
gray
dawn
had
i
not
recognized
you
after
twelve
years
as
my
brother
son
i
cut
the
rope
from
you
and
embraced
you
for
your
father
sake
you
rode
forth
a
cornet
in
my
army
instead
of
dying
like
a
felon
on
the
gallows
you
had
your
ends
to
serve
lucas
muttered
i
took
you
into
my
household
mayenne
went
on
i
let
you
wear
the
name
of
lorraine
i
did
not
deny
you
the
hand
of
my
cousin
and
ward
lorance
de
montluc
deny
me
no
you
did
not
neither
did
you
grant
it
me
but
put
me
off
with
lying
promises
you
thought
then
you
could
win
back
the
faltering
house
of
quentin
by
a
marriage
between
your
cousin
and
the
comte
de
mar
afterward
when
my
brother
charles
dashed
into
paris
and
the
people
clamoured
for
his
marriage
with
the
infanta
you
conceived
the
scheme
of
forcing
lorance
on
him
but
it
would
not
do
and
again
you
promised
her
to
me
if
i
could
get
you
certain
information
from
the
royalist
army
i
returned
in
the
guise
of
an
escaped
prisoner
to
camp
to
steal
you
secrets
and
the
moment
my
back
was
turned
you
listened
to
proposals
from
mar
again
mar
is
not
in
the
race
now
you
need
not
speak
of
him
nor
of
your
brother
charles
either
no
i
can
well
understand
that
my
brother
is
not
a
pleasant
name
in
your
ears
lucas
agreed
you
acknowledged
one
king
charles
x
you
would
like
well
to
see
another
charles
x
but
it
is
not
charles
of
guise
you
mean
i
have
no
desire
to
be
king
of
france
mayenne
began
angrily
have
you
not
that
is
well
for
you
will
never
feel
the
crown
on
your
brows
good
uncle
you
are
ground
between
the
spanish
hammer
and
the
béarnais
anvil
there
will
soon
be
nothing
left
of
you
but
powder
nom
de
dieu
paul
mayenne
cried
half
rising
but
lucas
leaning
forward
on
the
table
riveting
him
with
his
keen
eyes
went
on
do
not
mistake
me
monsieur
uncle
i
think
you
in
bad
case
but
i
am
ready
to
sink
or
swim
with
you
so
long
as
the
hand
of
lorance
is
in
your
bestowing
i
am
your
faithful
servant
i
have
not
hesitated
to
risk
the
gallows
to
serve
you
last
march
i
made
my
way
here
disguised
to
tell
you
of
the
king
coming
change
of
faith
and
of
certain
defection
i
demanded
then
my
price
my
marriage
with
mademoiselle
but
you
put
me
off
again
you
sent
me
back
to
mantes
to
kill
you
st
quentin
aye
and
you
have
been
about
it
these
four
months
and
you
have
not
killed
him
lucas
reddened
with
ire
i
am
no
jacques
clément
to
stab
and
be
massacred
you
can
not
buy
such
a
service
of
me
de
mayenne
if
i
do
bravo
work
for
you
i
choose
my
own
time
and
way
i
brought
the
duke
to
paris
delivered
him
up
to
you
to
deal
with
as
it
liked
you
but
you
with
your
army
at
your
back
were
afraid
to
kill
him
you
flinched
and
waited
you
dared
not
shoulder
the
onus
of
his
death
then
i
to
help
you
out
of
your
strait
planned
to
make
his
own
son
the
hand
that
should
do
the
deed
to
kill
the
duke
and
ruin
his
heir
to
put
not
only
quentin
but
mar
out
of
your
way
let
us
be
accurate
paul
mayenne
said
mar
was
not
in
my
way
he
was
of
no
consequence
to
me
you
mean
put
him
out
of
your
way
he
was
in
your
way
too
since
he
would
not
join
the
cause
he
was
a
hindrance
to
it
you
had
as
much
to
gain
as
i
by
his
ruin
something
not
as
much
i
did
not
want
him
killed
i
preferred
him
to
valère
nor
did
i
want
him
killed
so
our
views
jibed
well
why
not
then
did
you
prefer
him
as
your
wife
lover
to
some
other
who
might
appear
i
do
not
intend
that
my
wife
shall
have
lovers
lucas
answered
mayenne
broke
into
laughter
nom
chien
where
will
you
keep
her
in
the
bastille
lorance
and
no
lovers
ho
ho
i
mean
none
whom
she
favours
then
why
do
you
leave
mar
alive
she
adores
the
fellow
mayenne
said
i
had
no
idea
whether
he
really
thought
it
or
only
said
it
to
annoy
lucas
at
any
rate
it
had
its
effect
lucas
brows
were
knotted
he
spoke
with
an
effort
like
a
man
under
stress
of
physical
pain
i
know
she
loves
him
now
and
she
would
love
him
dead
but
she
would
not
love
him
a
parricide
is
that
your
creed
pardieu
you
do
know
women
the
blacker
the
villain
the
more
they
adore
him
i
know
it
is
true
monsieur
lucas
said
smoothly
that
you
have
had
successes
mayenne
started
forward
with
half
an
oath
changing
to
a
laugh
so
it
is
not
enough
for
you
to
possess
the
fair
body
of
lorance
you
must
also
have
her
love
she
will
love
me
lucas
answered
uneasily
she
must
it
is
not
worth
your
fret
mayenne
declared
if
she
did
how
long
would
it
last
femme
that
is
the
only
fixed
fact
about
her
if
lorance
loves
mar
she
will
love
some
one
else
and
some
one
else
still
the
day
after
it
is
not
worth
while
disturbing
yourself
about
it
she
will
not
love
any
one
else
lucas
said
hoarsely
mayenne
laughed
you
are
very
young
paul
she
shall
not
love
any
one
else
by
the
throne
of
heaven
she
shall
not
mayenne
went
on
laughing
if
lucas
had
for
the
moment
teased
him
out
of
his
equanimity
the
duke
had
paid
back
the
score
a
hundredfold
face
was
seared
with
his
passions
as
with
the
he
clinched
his
hands
together
breathing
hard
on
my
side
of
the
door
i
heard
a
sharp
little
sound
in
the
darkness
mademoiselle
had
gritted
her
teeth
it
is
a
little
early
to
sweat
over
the
matter
mayenne
said
since
mademoiselle
is
not
your
wife
nor
ever
likely
to
become
so
you
refuse
her
to
me
lucas
cried
livid
i
thought
he
would
leap
over
the
table
at
one
bound
on
mayenne
it
occurred
to
the
duke
to
take
up
his
dagger
i
promise
her
to
you
when
you
kill
me
quentin
and
you
have
not
killed
me
quentin
but
instead
come
airily
to
tell
me
the
scheme
my
scheme
is
wrecked
pardieu
it
was
never
my
scheme
i
never
advocated
stolen
pistoles
and
suborned
witnesses
and
angered
nephews
and
deceived
sons
and
the
rest
of
your
cumbrous
machinery
i
would
have
had
you
stab
him
as
he
bent
over
his
papers
and
walk
out
of
the
house
before
they
discovered
him
but
you
had
not
the
pluck
for
that
you
must
needs
plot
and
replot
to
make
some
one
else
do
your
work
now
after
months
of
intriguing
and
waiting
you
come
to
me
to
tell
me
you
have
failed
morbleu
is
there
any
reason
why
i
should
not
have
you
kicked
into
the
gutter
as
no
true
son
of
the
valourous
le
balafré
lucas
hand
went
to
his
belt
again
he
made
one
step
as
if
to
come
around
the
table
mayenne
angry
eye
was
on
him
but
he
did
not
move
and
lucas
made
no
more
steps
controlling
himself
with
an
effort
he
said
it
was
not
my
fault
monsieur
no
man
could
have
laboured
harder
or
planned
better
than
i
have
been
diligent
i
have
been
clever
i
have
made
my
worst
enemy
my
willing
tool
i
have
made
monsieur
own
son
my
i
have
left
no
end
loose
no
contingency
unprovided
for
and
i
am
ruined
by
a
freak
of
fate
i
never
knew
a
failure
yet
but
what
the
fault
was
fate
mayenne
returned
call
it
accident
then
call
it
the
devil
call
it
what
you
like
lucas
cried
i
still
maintain
it
was
not
my
fault
listen
monsieur
he
sat
down
again
and
began
his
story
striving
as
he
talked
to
reconquer
something
of
his
old
coolness
the
thing
was
ruined
by
the
advent
of
this
boy
mar
lackey
i
spoke
of
you
said
he
had
not
been
here
you
may
go
to
lorance
with
that
question
mayenne
answered
i
have
something
else
to
attend
to
than
the
intrigues
of
my
wife
maids
he
started
hither
i
thought
some
one
would
have
the
sense
to
keep
him
mordieu
i
will
find
from
lorance
whether
she
saw
him
he
fell
silent
gnawing
his
lip
i
could
see
that
his
thought
had
travelled
away
from
the
plot
to
the
sore
subject
of
affections
well
said
mayenne
sharply
what
about
your
boy
it
was
a
moment
before
lucas
answered
when
he
did
he
spoke
low
and
hurriedly
so
that
i
could
scarce
catch
the
words
i
knew
it
was
no
fear
of
listeners
that
kept
his
voice
down
they
had
shouted
at
each
other
as
if
there
was
no
one
within
a
mile
i
guessed
that
lucas
for
all
his
bravado
took
little
pride
in
his
tale
nor
felt
happy
about
its
reception
i
could
catch
names
now
and
then
monsieur
étienne
grammont
but
the
hero
of
the
tale
was
myself
you
let
him
to
the
duke
mayenne
cried
presently
at
the
harsh
censure
of
his
voice
lucas
rang
out
with
the
old
defiance
with
vigo
at
his
back
i
did
sangdieu
you
have
yet
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
quentin
equery
a
regiment
of
your
lansquenets
could
keep
him
out
does
he
never
take
wine
mayenne
asked
lifting
his
hand
with
shut
fingers
over
the
table
and
then
opening
them
that
is
easy
to
say
monsieur
sitting
here
in
your
own
hôtel
stuffed
with
your
soldiers
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
do
alone
in
my
house
when
at
the
least
suspicion
of
me
they
had
broken
me
on
the
wheel
that
is
the
rub
mayenne
cried
violently
that
is
the
trouble
with
all
of
you
you
think
more
of
the
safety
of
your
own
skins
than
of
accomplishing
your
work
mordieu
where
should
i
be
where
would
the
cause
be
if
my
first
care
was
my
own
peril
then
that
is
where
we
differ
uncle
lucas
answered
with
a
cold
sneer
you
are
it
is
well
known
a
patriot
toiling
for
the
church
and
the
king
of
spain
with
never
a
thought
for
the
welfare
of
charles
of
lorraine
lord
of
mayenne
but
i
paul
of
lorraine
your
humble
nephew
lord
of
my
brain
and
hands
freely
admit
that
i
am
toiling
for
no
one
but
the
aforesaid
paul
of
lorraine
i
should
find
it
most
inconvenient
to
get
on
without
a
head
on
my
shoulders
and
i
shall
do
my
best
to
keep
it
there
you
need
not
tell
me
that
i
know
it
well
enough
mayenne
answered
you
are
each
for
himself
none
for
me
at
the
same
time
paul
you
will
do
well
to
remember
that
your
interest
is
to
forward
my
interest
to
the
full
monsieur
and
i
shall
kill
you
quentin
yet
you
need
not
call
me
coward
i
am
working
for
a
dearer
stake
than
any
man
in
your
ranks
well
mayenne
rejoined
get
on
with
your
tale
lucas
went
on
mayenne
listening
quietly
with
no
further
word
of
blame
he
moved
not
so
much
as
an
eyelid
till
lucas
told
of
le
departure
when
he
flung
himself
forward
in
his
chair
with
a
sharp
oath
what
by
daylight
aye
he
was
afraid
after
this
discovery
of
being
set
on
at
night
he
went
out
in
broad
day
so
vigo
said
i
saw
him
not
lucas
answered
with
something
of
his
old
nonchalance
mille
tonnerres
du
diable
mayenne
shouted
if
this
is
true
if
he
got
out
in
broad
day
i
have
the
head
of
the
traitor
that
let
him
i
nail
it
over
his
own
gate
it
is
not
worth
your
fret
monsieur
lucas
said
lightly
if
you
did
how
long
would
it
avail
homme
that
is
the
only
fixed
fact
about
him
if
they
pass
quentin
they
will
pass
some
one
else
and
some
one
else
still
the
day
after
mayenne
looked
at
him
half
angry
half
startled
into
some
deeper
emotion
at
this
deft
twisting
of
his
own
words
souvent
homme
trahie
mal
habile
qui
fie
he
repeated
musingly
he
might
have
been
saying
over
the
motto
of
the
house
of
lorraine
for
the
guises
believed
in
no
man
good
faith
as
no
man
believed
in
theirs
homme
mayenne
said
again
as
if
in
the
words
he
recognized
a
bitter
verity
and
that
is
as
true
as
king
version
i
suppose
you
will
be
the
next
paul
when
i
give
up
hope
of
lorance
lucas
said
bluntly
i
caught
myself
suddenly
pitying
the
two
of
them
mayenne
because
for
all
his
power
and
splendour
and
rank
next
to
a
king
and
ability
second
to
none
he
dared
trust
no
man
not
the
son
of
his
body
not
his
brother
he
had
made
his
own
hell
and
dwelt
in
it
and
there
was
no
need
to
wish
him
any
and
lucas
perjured
traitor
was
farther
from
the
goal
of
his
desire
than
if
we
had
slain
him
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
what
next
it
appears
you
escaped
the
redoubted
vigo
mayenne
went
on
in
his
tone
and
the
vision
faded
and
i
saw
him
once
more
as
the
greatest
noble
and
greatest
scoundrel
in
france
and
feared
and
hated
him
and
lucas
too
as
the
betrayer
of
my
dear
lord
étienne
trust
me
for
that
then
came
you
here
not
at
once
i
tracked
mar
and
this
broux
to
mar
old
lodgings
at
the
three
lanterns
when
i
had
dogged
them
to
the
door
i
came
here
and
worked
upon
lorance
to
write
mar
a
letter
commanding
his
presence
for
i
thought
that
the
night
was
yet
young
and
he
might
be
out
of
my
reach
well
it
appears
he
had
not
the
courage
to
come
but
he
sent
the
boy
i
was
not
sorry
i
thought
i
could
settle
him
more
quietly
at
the
inn
the
boy
went
back
once
and
almost
ran
into
me
in
the
court
but
he
did
not
see
me
i
entered
and
asked
for
lodgings
but
the
fat
old
fool
of
a
host
put
me
through
the
catechism
like
an
inquisitor
and
finally
declared
the
inn
was
full
i
said
i
would
take
a
garret
but
it
was
no
use
out
i
must
trudge
i
did
and
paid
two
men
to
get
into
a
brawl
in
front
of
the
house
that
the
inn
people
might
run
out
to
look
but
instead
they
locked
the
gate
and
put
up
the
shutters
in
the
cabaret
mayenne
burst
out
laughing
it
was
not
your
night
paul
no
said
lucas
shortly
and
what
then
it
did
not
take
you
till
three
to
be
put
out
of
the
inn
no
lucas
answered
i
spoke
to
you
of
the
varlet
pontou
with
whom
grammont
had
quarrelled
he
had
shut
him
up
in
a
closet
of
the
house
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
after
the
fight
in
the
court
we
all
went
our
ways
forgetting
him
so
i
paid
the
house
a
visit
i
was
afraid
some
one
else
might
find
him
and
he
might
tell
tales
and
will
he
tell
tales
no
said
lucas
he
will
tell
no
tales
how
about
your
spy
in
the
hôtel
st
quentin
martin
the
clerk
oh
i
warned
him
off
before
i
left
lucas
said
easily
he
will
lie
perdu
till
we
want
him
again
and
grammont
you
see
is
dead
too
there
is
no
direct
witness
to
the
thing
but
the
boy
broux
that
as
good
as
to
say
there
is
none
mayenne
answered
for
i
have
the
boy
xvi
lucas
sprang
up
you
have
him
where
yes
i
have
him
mayenne
answered
with
his
tantalizing
slowness
alive
i
suppose
so
he
had
his
flogging
but
i
told
them
i
was
not
done
with
him
i
thought
we
might
have
a
use
for
him
he
is
in
the
oratory
there
diable
listening
cried
lucas
as
if
a
quick
doubt
of
mayenne
good
faith
to
him
struck
his
mind
certainly
not
mayenne
answered
the
door
is
bolted
he
might
be
in
the
street
for
all
he
can
hear
the
wall
was
built
for
that
what
will
you
do
with
him
monsieur
we
have
him
out
said
mayenne
lucas
needing
no
second
bidding
hastened
down
the
room
all
this
while
mademoiselle
on
the
floor
at
my
feet
had
neither
stirred
nor
whispered
as
rigid
as
the
statued
virgin
herself
but
now
she
rose
and
for
one
moment
laid
her
hand
on
my
shoulder
with
an
encouraging
pat
the
next
she
flung
the
door
wide
just
as
lucas
reached
the
threshold
he
recoiled
as
from
a
ghost
lorance
he
gasped
lorance
nom
de
dieu
came
mayenne
shout
from
the
back
of
the
room
what
lorance
he
caught
up
the
candelabrum
and
strode
over
to
us
mademoiselle
stepped
out
into
the
i
hanging
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
sill
she
was
as
white
as
linen
but
she
lifted
her
head
proudly
she
had
not
the
courage
that
knows
no
fear
but
she
had
the
courage
that
rises
to
the
need
crouching
on
the
oratory
floor
she
had
been
in
a
panic
lest
they
find
her
but
in
the
moment
of
discovery
she
faced
them
unflinching
you
spying
here
lorance
mayenne
stormed
at
her
i
did
not
come
here
to
spy
monsieur
she
answered
i
was
here
first
as
you
see
your
presence
was
as
unlooked
for
by
me
as
mine
by
you
his
next
accusation
brought
the
blood
in
scarlet
flags
to
her
pale
cheeks
she
made
him
no
answer
but
burned
him
with
her
indignant
eyes
mordieu
monsieur
lucas
cried
this
is
mlle
de
montluc
then
why
did
you
come
demanded
mayenne
because
i
had
done
harm
to
the
lad
and
was
sorry
she
said
you
defend
me
now
paul
but
you
did
not
hesitate
to
make
a
tool
of
me
in
your
cowardly
schemes
it
was
kindly
meant
mademoiselle
lucas
retorted
since
i
shall
kill
le
comte
de
mar
in
any
case
i
thought
it
would
pleasure
you
to
have
a
word
with
him
first
i
think
it
did
not
need
the
look
she
gave
him
to
make
him
regret
the
speech
this
lucas
was
an
extraordinary
compound
of
shrewdness
and
recklessness
one
separating
from
the
other
like
oil
and
vinegar
in
a
sloven
salad
he
could
plan
and
toil
and
wait
to
an
end
with
skill
and
fortitude
and
patience
but
he
could
not
govern
his
own
gusty
tempers
you
have
been
crying
lorance
mayenne
said
in
a
softer
tone
for
my
sins
monsieur
she
answered
quickly
i
am
grieved
most
bitterly
to
have
been
the
means
of
bringing
this
lad
into
danger
since
paul
cozened
me
into
doing
what
i
did
not
understand
and
since
this
is
not
the
man
you
wanted
but
only
his
servant
will
you
not
let
him
go
free
why
my
pretty
lorance
i
did
not
mean
to
harm
him
mayenne
protested
smiling
i
had
him
flogged
for
his
insolence
to
you
i
thought
you
would
thank
me
for
it
i
am
never
glad
over
a
flogging
monsieur
then
why
not
speak
a
word
from
you
and
it
had
stopped
she
flushed
red
for
very
shame
i
was
afraid
i
knew
you
vexed
with
me
she
faltered
oh
i
have
done
ill
she
turned
to
me
silently
imploring
forgiveness
there
was
no
need
to
ask
then
you
will
let
him
go
monsieur
alack
that
i
did
not
speak
before
thank
you
my
cousin
of
what
did
you
suspect
me
the
boy
was
whipped
for
a
bit
of
impertinence
to
you
i
had
no
cause
against
him
my
heart
leaped
up
at
the
same
time
i
scorned
myself
for
a
craven
that
i
had
been
overcome
by
groundless
terror
then
i
have
been
a
goose
so
to
disturb
myself
mademoiselle
laughed
out
in
relief
you
do
well
to
rebuke
me
cousin
i
shall
never
meddle
in
your
affairs
again
that
will
be
wise
of
you
mayenne
returned
for
i
did
mean
to
let
the
boy
go
but
since
you
have
opened
his
door
and
let
him
hear
what
he
should
not
i
have
no
choice
but
to
silence
him
monsieur
she
gasped
cowering
as
from
a
blow
aye
he
said
quietly
i
would
have
let
him
go
but
you
have
made
it
impossible
never
have
i
seen
so
piteous
a
sight
as
her
face
of
misery
had
my
hands
been
free
mayenne
had
been
startled
to
find
a
knife
in
his
heart
never
mind
mademoiselle
i
cried
to
her
you
came
and
wept
over
me
and
that
is
worth
dying
for
monsieur
she
cried
recovering
herself
after
the
first
instant
of
consternation
you
are
degrading
the
greatest
noble
in
the
land
you
the
head
of
the
house
of
lorraine
the
chief
of
the
league
the
commander
of
the
allied
armies
debase
yourself
in
stooping
to
take
vengeance
on
a
it
is
no
question
of
vengeance
it
is
a
question
of
safety
he
answered
impatiently
yet
i
marvelled
that
he
answered
at
all
since
absolute
power
is
not
obliged
to
give
an
account
of
itself
is
your
estate
then
so
tottering
that
a
can
overturn
it
in
that
case
be
advised
go
hang
yourself
monsieur
while
there
is
yet
time
he
flushed
with
anger
and
this
time
he
offered
no
justification
he
advanced
on
the
girl
with
outstretched
hand
mademoiselle
it
is
not
my
habit
to
take
advice
from
the
damsels
of
my
household
nor
do
i
admit
them
to
my
permit
me
then
to
conduct
you
to
the
staircase
she
retreated
toward
the
threshold
where
i
stood
still
covering
me
as
with
a
shield
monsieur
you
are
very
cruel
to
me
your
hand
mademoiselle
she
did
not
yield
it
to
him
but
held
out
both
hands
clasped
in
appeal
monsieur
you
have
always
been
my
loving
kinsman
i
have
always
tried
to
do
your
pleasure
i
thought
you
meant
harm
to
the
boy
because
he
was
a
servant
to
de
mar
and
i
knew
that
de
quentin
at
least
had
gone
over
to
the
other
side
i
did
not
know
what
you
would
do
with
him
and
i
could
not
rest
in
my
bed
because
it
was
through
me
he
came
here
monsieur
if
i
was
foolish
and
frightened
and
indiscreet
do
not
punish
the
lad
for
my
mayenne
was
still
holding
out
his
hand
for
her
i
wish
you
sweet
dreams
my
cousin
lorance
monsieur
she
cried
shrinking
back
till
she
stood
against
the
will
you
not
let
the
boy
go
how
will
you
look
he
said
with
his
unchanged
smile
if
you
lose
all
your
sleep
my
pretty
lorance
a
reproach
to
you
she
answered
quickly
you
will
mark
my
white
cheeks
and
my
red
eyes
and
you
will
say
there
is
my
little
cousin
lorance
my
good
ally
montluc
daughter
and
i
have
made
her
cry
her
eyes
blind
over
my
cruelty
her
father
dying
gave
her
to
me
to
guard
and
cherish
and
i
have
made
her
miserable
i
am
sorry
i
wish
i
had
not
done
it
mademoiselle
the
duke
repeated
will
you
get
to
your
bed
she
did
not
stir
but
fixing
him
with
her
brilliant
eyes
went
on
as
if
thinking
aloud
i
remember
when
i
was
a
tiny
maid
of
five
or
six
and
you
and
your
brother
guise
whom
god
rest
would
come
to
our
house
you
would
ask
my
father
to
send
for
me
as
you
sat
over
your
wine
and
i
would
run
in
to
kiss
you
and
be
fed
comfits
from
your
pockets
i
thought
you
the
handsomest
and
gallantest
gentleman
in
france
as
indeed
you
were
you
were
the
prettiest
little
creature
ever
was
mayenne
said
abruptly
and
my
little
heart
was
bursting
with
love
and
admiration
of
you
she
returned
when
i
first
could
lisp
i
learned
to
pray
for
my
cousin
henri
and
my
cousin
charles
i
have
never
forgotten
them
one
night
in
all
these
years
receive
and
bless
the
soul
of
henri
de
guise
god
guard
and
prosper
charles
de
mayenne
but
you
make
it
hard
for
me
to
ask
it
for
my
cousin
charles
this
is
a
great
coil
over
a
mayenne
said
curtly
life
is
as
dear
to
a
as
to
le
duc
de
mayenne
i
tell
you
i
did
not
mean
to
kill
the
boy
mayenne
said
with
the
door
shut
he
could
hear
nothing
i
meant
to
question
him
and
let
him
go
but
you
have
seen
fit
to
meddle
in
what
is
no
maid
business
mademoiselle
you
have
unlocked
the
door
and
let
him
listen
to
my
concerns
dead
men
mademoiselle
tell
no
tales
de
mayenne
she
said
i
can
not
see
that
you
need
trouble
for
the
tales
of
boys
you
the
lord
of
half
france
but
if
you
must
needs
fear
his
tongue
why
even
then
you
should
set
him
free
he
is
but
a
sent
here
with
a
message
it
is
wanton
murder
to
take
his
life
it
is
like
killing
a
child
he
is
not
so
harmless
as
you
would
lead
one
to
suppose
mademoiselle
the
duke
retorted
since
you
have
been
eavesdropping
you
have
heard
how
he
upset
your
cousin
paul
arrangements
for
that
you
should
be
thankful
to
him
monsieur
he
has
saved
you
the
stain
of
a
cowardly
crime
mordieu
mayenne
exclaimed
who
foully
murdered
my
brother
the
valois
and
his
henchman
st
quentin
not
so
she
cried
he
was
here
in
paris
when
it
happened
he
was
revolted
at
the
deed
did
they
teach
you
that
at
the
convent
no
but
it
is
true
de
quentin
warned
my
cousin
henri
not
to
go
to
blois
pardieu
you
think
them
angels
these
st
quentins
i
think
them
brave
and
honest
gentlemen
as
i
think
you
cousin
charles
that
sounds
ill
on
the
lips
that
have
but
now
called
me
villain
and
murderer
mayenne
returned
i
have
not
called
you
that
monsieur
i
said
you
had
been
saved
from
the
guilt
of
murder
and
i
knew
one
day
you
would
be
glad
he
kept
silence
eying
her
in
a
puzzled
way
after
a
moment
she
went
on
cousin
charles
it
is
our
lot
to
live
in
such
days
of
blood
and
turmoil
that
we
know
not
any
other
way
to
do
but
injure
and
kill
i
think
you
are
more
harassed
and
troubled
than
any
man
in
france
you
have
henry
of
navarre
and
the
huguenots
and
half
the
provinces
to
fight
in
the
field
and
your
own
league
to
combat
at
home
you
must
make
favour
with
each
of
a
dozen
quarrelling
factions
must
strive
and
strive
to
placate
and
loyalize
them
all
the
leaders
work
each
for
his
own
end
each
against
the
others
and
against
you
and
the
truth
is
not
in
one
of
them
and
their
pledges
are
ropes
of
straw
they
intrigue
and
rebel
and
betray
till
you
know
not
which
way
to
turn
and
you
curse
the
day
that
made
you
head
of
the
league
i
do
curse
the
day
henri
was
killed
mayenne
said
soberly
and
that
is
true
lorance
but
i
am
head
of
the
league
and
i
must
do
my
all
to
lead
it
to
success
but
not
by
the
path
of
shame
she
cried
quickly
success
never
yet
lay
that
way
henri
de
valois
slew
our
henri
and
see
how
god
dealt
with
him
he
looked
at
her
fixedly
i
think
he
heeded
her
words
less
than
her
shining
earnest
eyes
and
he
said
at
last
well
you
shall
have
your
boy
lorance
ah
monsieur
with
tears
dimming
the
brightness
of
those
sweet
eyes
she
dropped
on
her
knees
before
him
kissing
his
hand
lucas
since
his
one
unlucky
outburst
had
said
never
a
word
but
stood
looking
on
with
a
ruefulness
of
visage
that
it
warmed
the
cockles
of
my
heart
to
see
certes
he
was
in
no
very
pleasant
corner
this
dear
paul
his
mistress
had
heard
his
own
lips
describe
his
plot
against
the
quentins
there
was
no
possibility
of
lying
himself
clear
of
it
out
of
his
own
mouth
he
was
convicted
of
spycraft
treachery
and
cowardly
murder
and
in
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
as
in
the
hôtel
de
quentin
his
betrayal
had
come
about
through
me
i
was
unwitting
agent
in
both
cases
but
that
did
not
make
him
love
me
the
more
could
eyes
slay
i
had
fallen
of
the
glance
he
shot
me
over
mademoiselle
bowed
head
but
when
she
rose
he
said
to
her
mademoiselle
the
boy
is
as
much
my
prisoner
as
le
duc
since
i
got
him
here
but
i
too
freely
give
him
up
to
you
she
swept
him
a
curtsey
silently
without
looking
at
him
he
made
an
eager
pace
nearer
her
lorance
he
cried
in
a
low
rapid
voice
i
see
i
am
out
of
your
graces
now
by
our
lady
what
life
worth
to
me
if
you
will
not
take
me
back
again
i
admit
i
have
tried
to
ruin
the
comte
de
mar
is
that
any
marvel
since
he
is
my
rival
with
you
last
march
when
i
was
hiding
here
and
watched
from
my
window
the
gay
de
mar
come
airily
in
day
after
day
to
see
and
make
love
to
you
was
it
any
marvel
that
i
swore
to
bring
his
proud
head
to
the
dust
now
she
turned
to
him
and
met
his
gaze
squarely
the
means
you
employed
was
the
marvel
she
said
if
you
did
not
approve
of
his
visits
you
had
only
to
tell
him
so
he
had
been
ready
to
defend
to
you
his
right
to
make
them
but
you
never
showed
him
your
face
of
course
had
you
you
could
not
have
become
his
housemate
and
judas
oh
i
blush
to
know
that
the
same
blood
runs
in
your
veins
and
mine
you
speak
hard
words
mademoiselle
lucas
returned
keeping
his
temper
with
a
stern
effort
you
forget
that
we
live
in
france
in
and
not
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
i
was
toiling
for
more
than
my
own
revenges
i
was
working
at
your
cousin
mayenne
commands
to
aid
our
holy
cause
for
the
preservation
of
the
catholic
church
and
the
catholic
kingdom
of
france
your
conversion
is
sudden
then
only
an
hour
ago
you
were
working
for
nothing
and
no
one
but
paul
de
lorraine
come
come
lorance
mayenne
interposed
his
caution
setting
him
ever
on
the
side
of
compromise
paul
is
no
worse
than
the
rest
of
us
he
hates
his
enemies
and
so
do
we
all
he
works
against
them
to
the
best
of
his
power
and
so
do
we
all
they
are
kingsmen
we
are
leaguers
they
fight
for
their
side
and
we
fight
for
ours
if
we
plot
against
them
they
plot
against
us
we
murder
lest
we
be
murdered
we
can
not
scruple
over
our
means
nom
de
dieu
mademoiselle
what
do
you
expect
civil
war
is
not
a
mademoiselle
is
right
lucas
said
humbly
refusing
any
defence
we
have
been
using
cowardly
means
weapons
unworthy
of
christian
gentlemen
and
i
at
least
can
not
plead
le
duc
excuse
that
i
was
blinded
in
my
zeal
for
the
cause
for
i
know
and
you
know
there
is
but
one
cause
with
me
i
went
to
kill
quentin
because
i
was
promised
you
for
it
as
i
would
have
gone
to
kill
the
pope
himself
this
is
my
excuse
i
did
it
to
win
you
there
is
no
crime
in
god
calendar
i
would
not
commit
for
that
he
had
possessed
himself
of
her
hand
and
was
bending
over
her
burning
her
with
his
hot
eyes
mass
of
lies
as
the
man
was
in
this
last
sentence
i
knew
he
spoke
the
truth
she
strove
to
free
herself
from
him
with
none
of
the
flattered
pride
in
his
declaration
which
he
had
perhaps
looked
for
instead
she
eyed
him
with
positive
fear
as
if
she
saw
no
way
of
escape
from
his
rampant
desire
i
wish
rather
you
would
practise
a
little
virtue
to
win
me
she
said
so
i
will
if
you
ask
it
he
returned
unabashed
lorance
i
love
you
so
there
is
no
depth
to
which
i
could
not
stoop
to
gain
you
there
is
no
height
to
which
i
can
not
rise
there
is
no
shame
so
bitter
no
danger
so
awful
that
i
would
not
face
it
for
you
nor
is
there
any
sacrifice
i
will
not
make
to
gain
your
good
will
i
hate
de
mar
above
any
living
man
because
you
have
smiled
on
him
but
i
will
let
him
go
for
your
sake
i
swear
to
you
before
the
figure
of
our
blessed
lady
there
that
i
will
drop
all
enmity
to
étienne
de
mar
from
this
time
forward
i
will
neither
move
against
him
nor
cause
others
to
move
against
him
in
any
shape
or
manner
so
help
me
god
he
dropped
her
hand
to
kiss
the
cross
of
his
sword
she
retreated
from
him
her
face
very
pale
her
breast
heaving
you
make
it
hard
for
me
to
know
when
you
are
speaking
the
truth
she
said
may
the
lightning
strike
me
if
i
am
lying
lucas
cried
may
my
tongue
rot
at
the
root
if
ever
i
lie
to
you
lorance
then
i
am
very
grateful
and
glad
she
said
gravely
and
again
curtsied
to
him
yes
i
give
you
my
word
for
that
too
lorance
mayenne
added
i
have
no
quarrel
with
young
mar
his
father
has
stirred
up
more
trouble
for
me
than
any
dozen
of
huguenots
i
have
my
score
to
settle

she
said
sweeping
him
another
of
her
graceful
obeisances

mademoiselle
mayenne

on
i
pardon
him
but
not
that

past
the
quentins

navarre
men
now
and
our
enemies
for
your
sake
i
will
let

alone
but
if

near
you
again
i
will
crush
him
as
i
would
a
buzzing
fly
that
i
understand
monsieur
she
answered
in
a
low
tone
while
i
live
under
your
roof
i
shall
not
be
treacherous
to
you
i
am
a
ligueuse
and
he
is
a
kingsman
and
there
can
be
nothing
between
us
there
shall
be
nothing
monsieur
i
do
not
swear
it
as
paul
needs
because
i
have
never
lied
to
you
she
did
not
once
look
at
lucas
yet
i
think
she
saw
him
wince
under
her
stab
the
duke
of
mayenne
was
right
not
even
mlle
de
montluc
loved
her
enemies
you
are
a
good
girl
lorance
mayenne
said
will
you
let
the
boy
go
now
cousin
charles
she
asked
yes
i
will
let
your
boy
go
he
made
answer
but
if
i
do
this
for
you
i
shall
expect
you
henceforth
to
do
my
bidding
you
have
called
me
a
good
girl
cousin
aye
so
you
are
and
there
is
small
need
to
look
so
about
it
if
i
have
denied
you
one
lover
i
will
give
you
another
just
as
good
am
i
she
said
summoning
up
a
smile
then
my
looks
belie
me
for
since
you
free
this
poor
boy
whom
i
was
like
to
have
ruined
i
take
a
grateful
and
happy
heart
to
bed
aye
and
you
must
stay
happy
pardieu
what
does
it
matter
whether
your
husband
have
yellow
hair
or
brown
my
brother
henri
was
for
getting
himself
into
a
monastery
because
he
could
not
have
his
margot
yet
in
less
than
a
year
he
is
as
merry
as
a
fiddler
with
the
duchesse
katharine
you
have
made
me
happy
at
least
monsieur
she
answered
gently
if
not
merrily
it
is
the
most
foolish
act
of
my
life
mayenne
answered
but
it
is
for
you
lorance
if
ill
comes
to
me
by
it
yours
is
the
credit
you
can
swear
him
to
silence
monsieur
she
cried
quickly
what
use
he
would
not
keep
silence
he
will
if
i
ask
it
she
returned
flinging
me
a
look
of
bright
confidence
that
made
the
blood
dance
in
my
veins
but
mayenne
laughed
when
you
have
lived
in
the
world
as
long
as
i
have
you
will
not
so
flatter
yourself
lorance
thus
it
happened
that
i
was
not
bound
to
silence
concerning
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
in
the
house
of
lorraine
mayenne
took
out
his
dagger
what
i
do
i
do
thoroughly
i
said
i
set
you
free
free
you
shall
be
mademoiselle
sprang
forward
with
pleading
hand
let
me
cut
the
cords
cousin
charles
he
recoiled
a
bare
second
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
prompting
him
against
the
putting
of
a
weapon
in
any
one
hand
then
ashamed
of
the
suspicion
which
indeed
was
not
of
her
he
yielded
the
knife
and
she
cut
my
bonds
she
looked
straight
into
my
eyes
with
a
glance
earnest
beseeching
loving
i
could
not
begin
to
read
all
she
meant
by
it
the
next
moment
she
was
making
her
deep
curtsey
before
the
duke
monsieur
i
shall
never
cease
to
love
you
for
this
and
now
i
thank
you
for
your
long
patience
and
bid
you
good
night
with
a
bare
inclination
of
the
head
to
lucas
she
turned
to
go
but
mayenne
bade
her
pause
do
i
get
but
a
curtsey
for
my
courtesy
no
warmer
thanks
lorance
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
and
she
let
him
kiss
both
her
cheeks
i
will
conduct
you
to
the
staircase
mademoiselle
he
said
and
taking
her
hand
with
stately
politeness
led
her
from
the
room
the
light
seemed
to
go
from
it
with
the
gleam
of
her
yellow
gown
lorance
lucas
cried
to
her
but
she
never
turned
her
head
he
stood
glowering
grinding
his
teeth
together
his
glib
tongue
finding
for
once
no
way
to
better
his
sorry
case
he
was
the
picture
of
trickery
rewarded
i
could
not
repress
a
grin
at
him
marking
which
he
burst
out
at
me
vehemently
yet
in
a
low
tone
for
mayenne
had
not
closed
the
door
you
think
i
am
bested
do
you
you
devil
brat
let
him
laugh
that
wins
i
shall
have
her
yet
i
will
tell
le
comte
so
i
answered
with
all
the
impudence
i
could
muster
by
heaven
you
will
tell
him
nothing
he
cried
you
will
never
see
daylight
again
i
have
mayenne
word
i
began
but
his
retort
was
to
draw
dagger
i
deemed
it
time
to
stop
parleying
and
i
did
what
the
best
of
soldiers
must
do
sometimes
i
ran
i
bounded
into
the
oratory
flinging
the
door
to
after
me
he
was
upon
it
before
i
could
get
it
shut
and
the
heavy
oak
was
swung
this
way
and
that
between
us
till
it
seemed
as
if
we
must
tear
it
off
the
hinges
i
contrived
not
to
let
him
push
it
open
wide
enough
to
enter
meantime
as
i
was
unarmed
i
thought
it
no
shame
to
shriek
for
succour
i
heard
an
answering
cry
and
hurrying
footsteps
then
lucas
took
his
weight
from
the
door
so
suddenly
that
mine
banged
it
shut
the
next
minute
it
flew
open
again
mademoiselle
frightened
and
panting
on
the
threshold
a
tall
soldier
with
a
musket
stood
at
her
back
at
one
side
lucas
lounged
by
the
cabinet
where
the
duke
had
set
down
the
light
his
right
hand
he
held
behind
his
back
while
with
his
left
he
poked
his
dagger
into
the
mayenne
red
and
puffing
hurried
into
the
room
what
is
the
pother
he
demanded
what
devilment
now
paul
mademoiselle
protégé
is
nervous
lucas
answered
with
a
fine
sneer
when
i
drew
out
my
knife
to
get
the
thief
from
the
candle
he
screamed
to
wake
the
dead
and
took
sanctuary
in
the
oratory
i
had
given
him
the
lie
then
and
there
but
as
i
emerged
from
the
darkness
mayenne
commanded
take
him
out
to
the
street
the
tall
musketeer
saluting
motioned
me
to
precede
him
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
burning
to
defend
my
valour
before
mademoiselle
then
reflecting
how
much
harm
my
hasty
tongue
had
previously
done
me
and
that
the
path
to
freedom
was
now
open
before
me
i
said
nothing
nor
had
i
need
for
as
i
turned
she
flashed
over
to
lucas
and
said
straight
in
his
face
when
you
marry
me
paul
de
lorraine
you
will
marry
a
dead
wife
xvii
i
win
my
lady
lucas
prophecy
came
to
grief
within
five
minutes
of
the
making
for
when
the
musketeer
unbarred
the
house
door
for
me
the
first
thing
i
saw
was
the
morning
sun
my
spirits
danced
at
sight
of
him
as
he
himself
might
dance
on
easter
day
within
the
close
room
i
had
had
no
thought
but
that
it
was
still
black
midnight
and
now
at
one
step
i
passed
from
the
gloomy
house
into
the
heartening
sunshine
of
a
new
clean
day
i
ran
along
as
joyously
as
if
i
had
left
the
last
of
my
troubles
behind
me
forgotten
in
some
dark
corner
of
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
always
my
heart
lifts
when
after
hours
within
walls
i
find
myself
in
the
open
again
i
am
afraid
in
houses
but
out
of
doors
i
have
no
fear
of
harm
from
any
man
or
any
thing
though
sir
sun
was
risen
this
and
at
home
we
should
all
have
been
about
our
business
these
lazy
paris
folk
were
still
snoring
they
liked
well
to
turn
night
into
day
and
lie
long
abed
of
a
morning
although
here
a
shopkeeper
took
down
shutters
and
there
a
brisk
swept
the
yet
i
walked
through
a
sleeping
city
quiet
as
our
quentin
woods
save
that
here
my
footsteps
echoed
in
the
emptiness
at
length
with
the
knack
i
have
whatever
my
stupidities
of
finding
my
way
in
a
strange
place
i
arrived
before
the
courtyard
of
the
trois
lanternes
the
big
wooden
doors
were
indeed
shut
but
when
i
had
pounded
lustily
awhile
a
young
tapster
half
clad
and
cross
as
a
bear
opened
to
me
i
vouchsafed
him
scant
apology
but
dropping
on
a
heap
of
hay
under
a
shed
in
the
court
passed
straightway
into
dreamless
slumber
when
i
awoke
my
good
friend
the
sun
was
looking
down
at
me
from
near
his
zenith
and
my
first
happy
thought
was
that
i
was
just
in
time
for
dinner
then
i
discovered
that
i
had
been
prodded
out
of
my
rest
by
the
pitchfork
of
a
hostler
sorry
to
disturb
monsieur
but
the
horses
must
be
fed
oh
i
am
obliged
to
you
i
said
rubbing
my
eyes
i
must
go
up
to
le
comte
he
has
been
himself
to
look
at
you
and
gave
orders
you
were
not
to
be
disturbed
but
that
was
last
week
dame
you
slept
like
a
sabot
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
brush
the
straw
off
me
wash
my
face
at
the
trough
and
present
myself
before
monsieur
he
was
dressed
and
sitting
at
table
in
his
bedchamber
while
a
drawer
served
him
with
dinner
you
are
out
of
bed
monsieur
i
cried
but
yes
he
answered
springing
up
i
am
as
well
as
ever
i
was
félix
what
has
happened
to
you
illustration
sorry
to
disturb
monsieur
but
the
horses
must
be
fed
i
glanced
at
the
étienne
ordered
him
at
once
from
the
room
now
tell
me
quickly
he
cried
as
i
faltered
from
very
richness
of
matter
mademoiselle
ah
mademoiselle
i
exclaimed
mademoiselle
is
i
paused
in
a
dearth
of
words
worthy
of
her
she
is
she
is
he
agreed
laughing
oh
go
on
you
little
you
saw
her
and
she
said
he
was
near
to
laying
hands
on
me
to
hurry
my
tale
i
saw
her
and
mayenne
and
lucas
and
ever
so
many
things
i
told
him
and
they
had
me
flogged
and
mademoiselle
loves
you
she
does
he
cried
flushing
félix
does
she
you
can
not
know
but
i
do
know
it
i
answered
not
very
lucidly
you
see
she
have
wept
so
much
just
over
me
did
she
weep
lorance
he
exclaimed
they
flogged
me
i
said
they
did
hurt
me
much
but
she
came
down
in
the
night
with
a
candle
and
cried
over
me
and
what
said
she
now
i
am
sorry
they
beat
you
who
did
that
mayenne
what
said
she
félix
and
then
i
went
on
not
heeding
his
questions
in
sudden
remembrance
of
my
crowning
news
mayenne
and
lucas
came
in
and
here
is
something
you
do
not
know
monsieur
lucas
is
paul
de
lorraine
henri
de
son
mille
tonnerres
du
ciel
but
he
is
a
huguenot
a
rochelais
yes
but
he
is
a
son
of
henri
le
balafré
his
mother
was
rochelaise
i
think
he
was
a
spy
for
navarre
and
captured
at
ivry
they
were
going
to
hang
him
when
mayenne
worse
luck
recognized
him
for
a
nephew
since
then
he
has
been
spying
for
them
because
mayenne
promised
him
mlle
de
montluc
in
marriage
he
stared
at
me
with
dropped
jaw
absolutely
too
startled
to
swear
he
has
not
got
her
yet
i
cried
mayenne
told
him
he
should
have
her
when
he
had
killed
quentin
and
quentin
is
alive
great
god
said
étienne
only
half
aloud
dropping
down
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
overcome
to
realize
the
issue
that
had
hung
on
a
paltry
handful
of
pistoles
then
recovering
himself
a
little
he
cried
but
she
mademoiselle
you
need
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
there
i
said
mademoiselle
hates
him
does
she
know
i
think
she
understands
quite
well
what
lucas
is
i
made
answer
monsieur
i
must
tell
you
everything
that
happened
from
the
beginning
or
i
shall
never
make
it
clear
to
you
yes
yes
go
on
he
cried
he
sat
down
at
table
again
with
the
intention
of
eating
his
dinner
as
i
talked
but
precious
few
mouthfuls
he
took
at
every
word
i
spoke
he
got
deeper
into
the
interest
of
my
tale
i
never
talked
so
much
in
my
life
me
as
i
did
those
few
days
i
was
always
relating
a
history
to
monsieur
to
mademoiselle
to
étienne
to
well
you
shall
know
i
had
finished
at
length
and
he
burst
out
at
me
you
little
scamp
you
have
all
the
luck
i
never
saw
such
a
boy
well
do
they
call
you
félix
mordieu
here
i
lie
lapped
in
bed
like
a
baby
while
you
go
forth
i
must
lie
here
with
old
galen
for
all
company
while
you
bandy
words
with
the
generalissimo
himself
and
make
faces
at
lucas
and
kiss
the
hands
of
mademoiselle
but
i
stand
it
no
longer
i
done
with
lying
abed
and
letting
you
have
all
the
fun
no
i
shall
take
part
myself
but
monsieur
arm
pshaw
it
is
well
he
cried
it
is
a
scratch
it
is
nothing
pardieu
it
takes
more
than
that
to
put
a
quentin
out
of
the
reckoning
is
no
time
for
sloth
i
must
act
monsieur
i
began
but
he
broke
in
on
me
nom
de
dieu
félix
are
we
to
sit
idle
while
mademoiselle
is
carried
off
by
that
beast
lucas
of
course
not
i
said
i
was
only
trying
to
ask
what
monsieur
meant
to
do
to
take
the
moon
in
my
teeth
he
cried
yes
monsieur
but
how
ah
if
i
knew
he
stared
at
me
as
if
he
would
read
the
answer
in
my
face
but
he
found
it
as
blank
as
the
wall
he
flung
away
and
made
a
turn
down
the
room
and
came
back
to
seize
me
by
the
arm
how
are
we
to
do
it
félix
he
demanded
but
i
could
only
shrug
my
shoulders
and
answer
sais
pas
he
paced
the
floor
once
more
and
presently
faced
me
again
with
the
declaration
lucas
shall
have
her
only
over
my
dead
body
he
will
only
have
her
own
dead
body
i
said
he
turned
away
abruptly
and
stood
at
the
window
looking
out
with
unseeing
eyes
lorance
lorance
he
murmured
to
himself
i
think
he
did
not
know
he
spoke
aloud
if
i
could
get
word
to
her
he
went
on
presently
but
i
ca
send
you
again
should
i
write
a
letter
but
letters
are
mischievous
they
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
and
then
where
are
we
monsieur
i
suggested
if
i
could
get
a
letter
into
the
hands
of
pierre
that
lackey
who
befriended
me
but
he
shook
his
head
they
know
you
about
the
place
it
were
safer
to
despatch
one
of
these
if
any
had
the
sense
to
go
rein
in
hand
hang
me
if
i
think
i
go
myself
monsieur
i
said
lucas
swore
by
all
things
sacred
that
he
would
never
molest
you
more
therefore
you
will
do
well
to
keep
out
of
his
way
my
faith
félix
he
laughed
you
take
a
black
view
of
mankind
not
of
mankind
étienne
only
of
lucas
not
of
monsieur
or
you
or
vigo
and
of
mayenne
i
do
make
out
mayenne
i
answered
i
thought
he
was
the
worst
of
the
crew
but
he
let
me
go
he
said
he
would
and
he
did
think
you
he
meant
to
let
you
go
from
the
first
who
knows
i
said
shrugging
lucas
is
always
lying
but
mayenne
sometimes
he
lies
and
sometimes
not
he
base
and
then
again
he
kind
you
ca
make
out
mayenne
he
does
not
mean
you
shall
étienne
returned
yet
the
key
is
not
buried
he
is
made
up
like
all
the
rest
of
us
of
good
and
bad
monsieur
i
said
if
there
is
any
bad
in
the
quentins
i
for
one
do
not
know
it
ah
félix
he
cried
you
may
believe
that
till
doomsday
you
will
of
monsieur
his
face
clouded
a
little
and
he
fell
silent
i
knew
that
besides
his
thoughts
of
his
lady
came
other
thoughts
of
his
father
he
sat
gravely
silent
but
of
last
night
bitter
distress
he
showed
no
trace
last
night
he
had
not
been
able
to
take
his
eyes
from
the
miserable
past
but
he
saw
the
future
a
future
not
altogether
flowery
perhaps
but
one
which
however
it
turned
out
should
not
repeat
the
old
mistakes
and
shames
félix
he
said
at
length
i
see
nothing
for
it
but
to
eat
my
pride
i
kept
still
in
the
happy
hope
that
i
should
hear
just
what
i
longed
to
he
went
on
i
swore
then
that
i
would
never
darken
his
doors
again
i
was
mad
with
anger
so
was
he
he
said
if
i
went
with
gervais
i
went
forever
monsieur
if
you
repent
your
hot
words
so
does
he
i
must
give
him
the
chance
if
he
do
repent
them
it
were
churlish
to
deny
him
the
opportunity
to
tell
me
so
if
he
still
maintain
them
it
were
cowardly
to
shrink
from
hearing
it
no
whatever
monsieur
replies
i
must
go
tell
him
i
repent
i
came
forward
to
kiss
his
hand
i
was
so
pleased
oh
you
look
very
smiling
over
it
he
cried
think
you
i
like
sneaking
back
home
again
like
a
whipped
hound
to
his
kennel
but
i
protested
indignant
monsieur
is
not
a
whipped
hound
well
a
prodigal
son
as
lucas
named
me
yesterday
it
is
the
same
thing
i
have
heard
read
the
story
of
the
prodigal
son
i
said
and
he
was
a
vaurien
if
you
like
no
more
monsieur
sort
than
lucas
himself
but
it
says
that
when
his
father
saw
him
coming
a
long
way
off
he
ran
out
to
meet
him
and
fell
on
his
neck
étienne
looked
not
altogether
convinced
well
however
it
turns
out
it
must
be
gone
through
with
it
is
only
decent
to
go
to
monsieur
but
even
at
that
i
think
i
should
not
go
if
it
were
not
for
mademoiselle
you
will
beg
his
aid
monsieur
i
will
beg
his
advice
at
least
for
how
you
and
i
are
to
carry
off
mademoiselle
under
mayenne
hand
well
i
confess
for
the
nonce
that
beats
me
we
must
do
it
monsieur
i
cried
aye
and
we
will
come
félix
you
may
put
your
knife
in
my
dish
we
must
eat
and
be
off
the
meats
have
got
cold
and
the
wine
warm
but
never
mind
i
did
not
mind
but
was
indeed
thankful
to
get
any
dinner
at
all
once
resolved
on
the
move
he
was
in
a
fever
to
be
off
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
in
the
streets
bound
for
the
hôtel
quentin
he
said
no
more
of
monsieur
as
we
walked
but
plied
me
with
questions
about
mlle
de
montluc
not
only
as
to
every
word
she
said
but
as
to
every
turn
of
her
head
and
flicker
of
her
eyelids
and
he
called
me
a
dull
oaf
when
i
could
not
answer
but
as
we
entered
the
quartier
marais
he
fell
silent
more
than
ever
his
lady
looked
he
had
his
fair
allowance
of
pride
this
étienne
he
found
his
own
words
no
palatable
meal
however
when
we
came
within
a
dozen
paces
of
the
gate
he
dropped
as
one
drops
a
cloak
all
signs
of
gloom
or
discomposure
and
approached
the
entrance
with
the
easy
swagger
of
the
gay
young
gallant
who
had
lived
there
as
if
returning
from
a
morning
stroll
he
called
to
the
sentry
holà
squinting
charlot
open
now
morbleu
le
comte
the
fellow
exclaimed
running
to
draw
the
bolts
well
this
is
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
anyway
étienne
laughed
out
in
pleasure
it
put
heart
into
him
i
could
see
that
his
first
greeting
should
be
thus
friendly
vigo
did
know
what
had
become
of
you
monsieur
chariot
volunteered
the
old
man
was
in
the
best
of
tempers
last
night
after
lucas
got
away
and
you
gave
us
the
slip
too
he
called
us
all
blockheads
and
cursed
idiots
things
were
lively
for
a
time
nom
chien
eh
bien
i
am
found
étienne
returned
in
time
we
get
lucas
too
is
monsieur
back
no
étienne
not
yet
i
think
he
was
half
sorry
half
glad
where
vigo
he
demanded
somewhere
about
i
find
him
for
monsieur
no
stay
at
your
post
i
find
him
he
went
straight
across
the
court
and
in
at
the
door
he
had
sworn
never
again
to
darken
humility
and
repentance
might
have
brought
him
there
but
it
was
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
drew
him
over
the
threshold
without
a
falter
alone
in
the
hall
was
my
little
friend
marcel
throwing
dice
against
himself
to
while
the
time
away
he
sprang
up
at
sight
of
us
agleam
with
excitement
well
marcel
my
master
said
and
where
is
m
i
think
in
the
stables
monsieur
bid
him
come
to
me
in
the
small
cabinet
he
turned
with
accustomed
feet
into
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
where
vigo
kept
the
rolls
of
the
guard
i
knowing
it
to
be
my
duty
to
keep
close
at
hand
lest
i
be
wanted
followed
soon
marcel
came
flying
back
to
say
vigo
was
on
his
way
étienne
thanked
him
and
he
hung
about
longing
to
pump
me
and
in
my
lord
presence
not
quite
daring
till
i
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
turned
him
out
i
hate
curiosity
étienne
stood
behind
the
table
looking
his
haughtiest
he
was
unsure
of
a
welcome
from
the
contumacious
vigo
i
read
in
his
eyes
a
stern
determination
to
set
this
insolent
servant
in
his
place
the
big
man
entered
saluted
came
straight
over
to
his
young
side
no
whit
hesitating
and
said
as
heartily
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
hard
word
between
them
étienne
i
had
liefer
see
you
stand
here
than
the
king
himself
étienne
displayed
the
funniest
face
of
bafflement
he
had
been
prepared
to
lash
rudeness
or
sullenness
to
accept
de
haut
en
bas
shamed
contrition
but
this
easy
cordiality
took
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
he
stared
and
then
flushed
and
then
laughed
and
then
he
held
out
his
hand
saying
simply
thank
you
vigo
vigo
bent
over
to
kiss
it
in
cheerful
ignorance
of
how
that
hand
had
itched
to
box
his
ears
what
became
of
you
last
night
m
étienne
he
inquired
i
was
hunting
lucas
when
does
monsieur
return
vigo
he
thought
he
might
be
back
but
he
could
not
tell
have
you
sent
to
tell
him
about
me
he
asked
colouring
no
i
could
do
that
vigo
said
you
see
it
is
quite
on
the
cards
that
the
spanish
gang
may
come
hither
to
clean
us
out
i
want
every
man
i
have
if
they
do
i
understand
that
étienne
said
but
so
long
as
you
are
innocent
a
day
or
two
matters
not
vigo
pronounced
he
will
presently
turn
up
here
or
send
word
that
he
will
not
return
till
the
king
comes
in
but
since
you
are
impatient
le
comte
you
can
go
to
him
at
denis
if
can
get
through
the
gates
can
aye
but
i
have
business
in
paris
i
mean
to
join
king
henry
vigo
there
glory
going
begging
out
there
at
denis
it
would
like
me
well
to
bear
away
my
share
but
he
broke
off
to
begin
again
abruptly
ah
vigo
that
still
tongue
of
yours
you
knew
then
that
there
was
more
cause
of
trouble
between
my
father
and
me
than
the
pistoles
i
knew
he
suspected
you
of
a
kindness
for
the
league
monsieur
but
you
are
cured
of
that
there
you
are
wrong
for
i
never
had
it
and
i
am
not
cured
of
it
if
i
hung
around
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
it
was
not
for
politics
it
was
for
petticoats
vigo
made
no
answer
but
the
corners
of
his
grim
mouth
twitched
that
no
news
either
well
then
since
you
know
so
much
you
may
as
well
know
more
step
up
félix
and
tell
your
tale
i
did
as
i
was
bid
étienne
now
and
then
taking
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
in
his
eagerness
vigo
listening
to
us
both
with
grave
attention
i
had
for
the
second
time
in
my
career
the
pleasure
of
startling
him
out
of
his
iron
composure
when
i
told
him
the
true
name
and
condition
of
lucas
but
at
the
end
of
the
adventure
all
the
comment
he
made
was
a
fool
for
luck
well
said
étienne
impatiently
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
what
are
we
to
do
about
it
do
why
nothing
nothing
he
cried
with
his
hand
on
his
sword
nothing
and
let
that
scoundrel
have
her
that
is
de
mayenne
affair
vigo
said
we
ca
help
it
i
will
help
it
étienne
declared
mordieu
am
i
to
let
that
traitor
that
spy
that
soul
of
dirt
marry
mlle
de
montluc
what
mayenne
wishes
he
have
vigo
said
some
day
you
will
surely
get
a
chance
to
fight
lucas
monsieur
and
meantime
he
is
to
enjoy
her
it
is
a
pity
vigo
admitted
but
there
is
mayenne
can
we
storm
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
no
one
can
drink
up
the
sea
one
could
if
he
wanted
to
as
much
as
i
want
mademoiselle
my
lord
declared
but
vigo
shook
his
head
monsieur
he
said
gravely
monsieur
you
have
a
great
chance
you
have
a
sword
and
a
good
cause
to
draw
it
in
what
more
should
a
man
ask
in
the
world
than
that
your
father
has
been
without
it
these
three
years
and
for
want
of
it
he
has
eaten
his
heart
out
you
have
been
without
it
and
you
have
got
yourself
into
all
sorts
of
mischief
but
now
all
that
is
coming
straight
king
henry
is
turning
catholic
so
that
a
man
may
follow
him
without
offence
to
god
he
is
a
good
fellow
and
a
general
he
just
out
there
at
denis
there
your
place
m
étienne
not
vigo
yes
étienne
be
advised
monsieur
vigo
said
with
his
steady
persistence
there
is
nothing
to
gain
by
staying
here
to
drink
up
the
sea
mayenne
will
no
more
give
your
lady
to
you
now
than
he
would
give
her
to
félix
and
you
can
no
more
carry
her
off
than
could
félix
mayenne
will
have
you
killed
and
flung
into
the
seine
as
easy
as
eat
breakfast
and
you
bid
me
grudge
my
life
strange
counsel
from
you
vigo
no
monsieur
but
i
bid
you
not
throw
it
away
we
all
hope
to
die
afield
but
we
have
a
preference
how
and
where
if
you
fell
fighting
for
navarre
i
should
be
sorry
monsieur
would
grieve
deep
but
we
should
say
it
was
well
we
grudged
not
your
life
to
the
country
and
the
king
while
if
you
fall
in
this
fool
affair
i
fall
for
my
lady
étienne
finished
the
bravest
captain
of
them
all
does
no
better
than
that
étienne
she
is
no
wife
for
you
you
can
not
get
her
and
if
you
could
pity
she
is
a
ligueuse
and
you
from
now
on
are
a
staunch
kingsman
give
her
up
monsieur
you
have
had
this
maggot
in
your
brain
this
four
years
once
for
all
get
it
out
go
to
denis
take
your
troop
among
biron
horse
that
is
the
place
for
you
you
will
marry
a
maid
of
honour
and
die
a
marshal
of
france
étienne
laid
his
arm
around
vigo
shoulder
with
a
smile
good
old
vigo
vigo
tell
me
this
if
you
saw
a
marshal
baton
waiting
you
in
the
field
and
at
home
your
dearest
friend
were
alone
and
in
peril
would
you
go
off
after
glory
aye
if
was
a
hopeless
business
to
stay
certes
i
would
go
oh
tell
that
in
bedlam
étienne
cried
you
would
do
nothing
of
the
sort
was
it
to
win
glory
you
stayed
three
years
in
that
hole
st
quentin
i
had
no
choice
monsieur
my
master
was
there
and
my
mistress
is
here
you
may
save
your
breath
vigo
i
know
what
i
shall
do
the
eloquence
of
monk
christin
would
change
me
what
is
your
purpose
m
étienne
vigo
asked
indeed
there
was
a
vagueness
about
his
scheme
as
revealed
to
us
it
is
quite
simple
i
purpose
to
get
speech
with
mademoiselle
if
i
can
contrive
it
and
i
think
i
can
i
purpose
to
smuggle
her
out
of
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
such
feats
have
been
accomplished
before
and
may
be
again
then
i
shall
bring
her
here
and
hold
her
against
all
comers
no
vigo
said
no
monsieur
you
may
not
do
that
ventre
bleu
vigo
his
young
lord
cried
no
said
vigo
i
ca
have
her
here
and
mayenne
army
after
her
coward
shouted
étienne
i
thought
vigo
would
take
us
both
by
the
scruff
of
our
necks
and
throw
us
out
of
the
place
but
he
answered
undisturbed
no
that
is
not
the
reason
monsieur
if
le
duc
told
me
to
hold
this
house
against
the
armies
of
france
and
spain
i
hold
it
till
the
last
man
of
us
was
dead
but
i
am
here
in
his
absence
to
guard
his
hôtel
his
moneys
and
his
papers
i
do
call
it
guarding
to
throw
a
firebrand
among
them
bringing
mayenne
niece
here
would
be
worse
than
that
monsieur
would
never
hesitate
monsieur
is
no
étienne
cried
if
he
were
here
he
say
defend
the
lady
if
every
stone
in
this
house
is
pulled
from
its
fellow
a
twinkle
came
into
vigo
eyes
i
think
that
is
likely
true
he
said
monsieur
opposed
the
marriage
as
long
as
mayenne
desired
it
but
now
that
mayenne
forbids
it
stealing
the
demoiselle
is
another
pair
of
sleeves
well
then
cried
étienne
all
good
humour
in
a
moment
what
more
do
you
want
we
divert
ourselves
pouring
pitch
out
of
the
windows
on
mayenne
ruffians
no
étienne
it
ca
be
done
if
le
duc
were
here
and
gave
the
command
to
receive
her
that
would
be
one
thing
no
one
would
obey
with
a
readier
heart
than
mordieu
monsieur
i
have
no
objection
to
succouring
a
damsel
in
distress
i
have
been
in
the
business
before
now
then
why
not
now
death
of
my
life
vigo
when
i
know
and
you
know
monsieur
would
approve
i
do
know
it
monsieur
vigo
said
i
only
think
it
and
i
can
not
move
by
my
own
guesswork
i
am
in
charge
of
the
house
till
monsieur
returns
i
purpose
to
do
nothing
to
jeopard
it
but
i
interfere
in
no
way
with
your
liberty
to
proceed
as
you
please
i
should
think
not
forsooth
étienne
blazed
out
furiously
i
could
rejoined
vigo
with
his
maddening
tranquillity
i
could
order
the
guard
and
they
would
obey
to
lock
you
up
in
your
chamber
i
believe
monsieur
would
thank
me
for
it
but
i
do
do
it
i
leave
you
free
to
act
as
it
likes
you
my
lord
was
white
with
ire
who
is
master
here
you
or
i
neither
of
us
le
comte
but
monsieur
leaving
put
the
keys
in
my
hand
and
i
am
head
of
the
house
till
he
returns
you
are
very
angry
étienne
but
my
shoulders
are
broad
enough
to
bear
it
your
madness
will
get
no
countenance
from
me
hang
you
for
an
obstinate
pig
étienne
cried
vigo
said
no
more
he
had
made
plain
his
position
he
had
naught
to
add
or
retract
face
cleared
after
all
there
was
no
use
being
angry
with
vigo
one
might
as
well
make
fists
at
the
flow
of
the
seine
very
well
étienne
swallowed
his
wrath
it
is
understood
that
i
get
no
aid
from
you
then
i
have
nobody
in
the
world
with
me
save
félix
here
but
for
all
that
i
win
my
lady
xviii
the
but
vigo
proved
better
than
his
word
if
he
would
give
us
no
countenance
he
gave
freely
good
broad
gold
pieces
he
himself
suggested
étienne
need
of
the
sinews
of
war
not
in
the
least
embarrassed
or
offended
because
he
knew
le
comte
to
be
angry
with
him
he
was
no
feather
ruffled
serene
in
the
consciousness
that
he
was
absolutely
in
the
right
his
position
was
impregnable
neither
persuasion
ridicule
nor
abuse
moved
him
one
whit
he
had
but
a
single
purpose
in
life
he
was
born
to
forward
the
interests
of
the
duke
of
quentin
he
would
forward
them
if
need
were
over
our
bleeding
corpses
on
top
of
all
his
disobedience
and
disrespect
he
was
most
amiable
to
étienne
treating
him
with
a
calm
assumption
of
friendliness
that
would
have
maddened
a
saint
yet
it
was
not
hypocrisy
he
liked
his
young
lord
as
we
all
did
he
would
not
let
him
imperil
monsieur
but
aside
from
that
he
wished
him
every
good
fortune
in
the
world
étienne
argued
no
more
he
was
wroth
and
sore
over
vigo
attitude
but
he
said
little
he
accepted
the
advance
of
money
of
course
monsieur
would
say
what
coin
is
his
is
yours
vigo
explained
and
despatched
me
to
settle
his
score
at
the
three
lanterns
i
set
out
on
my
errand
rather
down
in
the
mouth
we
had
accomplished
nothing
by
our
return
to
the
hôtel
nay
rather
had
we
lost
for
we
were
both
of
us
i
thought
disheartened
by
the
cold
water
flung
on
our
ambitions
i
took
the
liberty
of
doubting
whether
perfect
loyalty
to
monsieur
included
thwarting
and
disobeying
his
heir
it
was
all
very
well
for
monsieur
to
spoil
vigo
and
let
him
speak
his
mind
as
became
not
his
station
for
vigo
never
disobeyed
but
stood
by
him
in
all
things
but
i
imagined
that
were
étienne
master
vigo
for
all
his
years
of
service
would
be
packed
off
the
premises
in
short
order
i
walked
along
in
a
brown
study
wondering
how
étienne
did
purpose
to
rescue
mademoiselle
his
scheme
so
far
as
vouchsafed
to
me
was
somewhat
in
the
air
i
could
only
hope
he
had
more
in
his
mind
than
he
had
let
me
know
it
seemed
to
me
a
pity
not
to
be
doing
something
in
the
matter
and
though
i
had
no
particular
liking
for
hôtel
de
lorraine
hospitality
i
had
very
willingly
been
bound
thither
at
this
moment
to
try
to
get
a
letter
to
mademoiselle
but
he
would
not
send
me
no
he
had
said
it
wo
do
think
of
something
better
félix
but
i
could
not
and
so
was
taking
my
dull
way
to
the
inn
of
the
trois
lanternes
the
city
wore
a
sleepy
afternoon
look
it
was
very
hot
and
few
cared
to
be
stirring
i
saw
nothing
worth
my
notice
until
only
a
throw
from
the
three
lanterns
i
came
upon
a
big
black
coach
standing
at
the
door
of
a
rival
auberge
it
aroused
my
interest
at
once
for
a
was
a
rare
sight
in
the
beleaguered
city
as
my
master
had
said
this
was
not
a
time
of
to
paris
i
readily
imagined
that
the
owner
of
this
chariot
came
on
weighty
business
indeed
he
might
be
an
ambassador
from
spain
a
legate
from
rome
i
paused
by
the
group
of
street
urchins
who
were
stroking
the
horses
and
clambering
on
the
back
of
the
coach
to
wonder
whether
it
would
be
worth
while
to
wait
and
see
the
dignitary
come
out
i
was
just
going
to
ask
the
coachman
a
question
or
two
concerning
his
journey
when
he
began
to
snap
his
whip
about
the
bare
legs
of
the
little
whelps
the
street
was
so
narrow
that
he
could
hardly
chastise
them
without
danger
to
me
so
it
seemed
best
to
saunter
off
the
screaming
urchins
stopped
just
out
of
the
reach
of
his
lash
and
set
to
pelting
mud
at
him
with
a
right
good
will
but
i
was
too
old
for
that
game
i
reflected
that
i
was
charged
with
business
for
my
master
and
that
it
was
nothing
to
me
what
envoys
might
come
to
mayenne
i
went
on
into
the
three
lanterns
the
cabaret
was
absolutely
deserted
one
might
have
walked
all
about
and
carried
off
what
he
pleased
as
from
the
sleeping
palace
in
the
tale
this
is
a
pretty
way
to
keep
an
inn
i
thought
where
have
all
the
lazy
rascals
got
to
then
i
heard
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
and
shuffle
of
feet
from
the
back
and
i
went
through
into
the
passage
where
the
staircase
was
here
were
gathered
in
a
huddle
like
scared
sheep
some
dozen
of
the
men
and
maids
the
lasses
most
of
them
in
tears
the
men
looking
scarce
less
terrified
their
gaze
was
fixed
on
the
closed
door
of
maître
menard
little
whence
issued
the
shrill
cry
spare
me
noble
gentlemen
spare
a
poor
innkeeper
i
swear
i
know
nothing
of
his
whereabouts
as
my
footsteps
sounded
on
the
threshold
one
and
all
spun
round
to
look
at
me
in
fresh
dread
mon
dieu
it
is
his
lackey
a
chambermaid
cried
in
the
next
second
a
little
wiry
dame
her
eyes
blazing
with
fury
darted
out
of
the
group
and
seized
me
by
the
arm
with
a
grip
of
her
nails
that
made
me
think
a
panther
had
got
me
so
here
you
are
she
screamed
i
declare
i
thought
she
was
going
to
bite
me
you
and
your
fine
master
that
come
here
and
devour
our
substance
and
never
pay
one
sou
but
bring
ruin
to
the
house
now
go
you
straight
in
there
and
let
them
squeeze
your
throat
awhile
and
see
how
you
like
it
yourself
she
swept
me
across
the
passage
like
a
whirlwind
opened
the
door
shoved
me
in
and
banged
it
after
me
before
i
could
collect
my
senses
the
room
was
small
it
was
very
well
filled
up
by
a
bureau
a
strong
box
a
table
two
chairs
three
soldiers
one
innkeeper
and
myself
the
bureau
stood
by
the
window
with
maître
menard
on
it
opposite
was
the
table
with
a
captain
of
dragoons
on
it
of
his
two
men
one
took
the
middle
of
the
room
amusing
himself
with
the
windpipe
of
maître
menard
the
other
was
posted
at
the
door
i
was
shot
out
of
mme
menard
grasp
into
his
and
i
found
his
the
gentler
of
the
two
i
say
i
know
not
where
he
went
maître
menard
was
gasping
black
in
the
face
from
the
dragoon
attentions
he
did
not
tell
i
have
no
notion
ah
the
breath
failed
him
utterly
but
his
eyes
bloodshot
and
bulging
rolled
toward
me
what
now
the
captain
cried
springing
to
his
feet
who
are
you
he
wore
under
his
breastplate
what
i
took
to
be
the
uniform
of
the
city
guards
i
had
seen
the
like
on
the
officer
of
the
gate
the
night
i
entered
paris
he
was
a
young
man
of
a
decidedly
bourgeois
appearance
as
if
he
were
not
much
outside
of
his
uniform
my
name
is
félix
broux
i
said
i
came
to
pay
a
bill
his
servant
maître
menard
contrived
to
murmur
the
dragoon
allowing
him
a
breath
oh
you
are
the
comte
de
mar
servant
are
you
where
have
you
left
your
master
what
do
you
want
of
him
i
asked
in
turn
never
you
mind
i
want
him
but
mayenne
said
he
should
not
be
touched
i
cried
the
duke
of
mayenne
said
himself
he
should
not
be
touched
i
know
nothing
about
that
he
returned
a
trifle
more
civilly
than
he
had
spoken
i
have
naught
to
do
with
the
duke
of
mayenne
if
he
is
friends
with
your
master
de
mar
may
not
stay
behind
bars
very
long
but
i
have
the
governor
warrant
for
his
arrest
on
what
charge
a
trifle
merely
murder
yes
the
murder
of
a
lackey
one
pontou
but
that
is
ridiculous
i
cried
le
comte
did
not
i
came
to
a
halt
not
knowing
what
to
say
lucas
paul
de
lorraine
killed
him
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
but
i
choked
it
down
to
fling
wild
accusations
against
a
great
man
man
were
no
wisdom
by
accident
i
had
given
the
officer
the
impression
that
we
were
friends
of
mayenne
i
should
do
ill
to
imperil
the
delusion
le
comte
i
began
again
and
again
stopped
i
meant
to
say
that
monsieur
had
never
left
the
inn
last
night
he
could
have
had
no
hand
in
the
crime
then
i
bethought
me
that
i
had
better
not
know
the
hour
of
the
murder
le
comte
is
a
very
grand
gentleman
he
would
not
murder
a
lackey
i
got
out
at
last
you
can
tell
that
to
the
judges
the
captain
rejoined
at
this
i
felt
ice
sliding
down
my
spine
to
be
arrested
as
a
witness
was
the
last
thing
i
desired
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
i
cried
he
seemed
to
me
a
very
fine
gentleman
but
you
ca
always
tell
about
these
nobles
the
comte
de
mar
i
only
known
him
hours
until
he
engaged
me
as
lackey
yesterday
afternoon
i
had
never
laid
eyes
on
him
i
know
not
what
he
has
been
about
he
engaged
me
yesterday
to
carry
a
message
for
him
to
the
hôtel
quentin
i
came
into
paris
but
night
before
last
and
put
up
at
the
amour
de
dieu
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
yesterday
he
employed
me
to
run
his
errands
and
last
night
brought
me
here
with
him
but
i
had
never
seen
him
till
this
time
yesterday
i
know
nothing
about
him
save
that
he
seemed
a
very
easy
master
to
a
nice
ear
i
might
have
seemed
a
little
too
voluble
but
the
captain
only
laughed
at
my
patent
fright
oh
you
need
not
look
so
i
have
no
warrant
for
your
arrest
i
dare
say
you
are
as
great
a
rogue
as
he
but
the
order
says
nothing
about
you
do
swoon
away
you
are
in
no
peril
i
was
stung
to
be
thought
such
a
craven
but
i
pocketed
the
insult
and
merely
answered
i
assure
you
monsieur
i
know
naught
of
the
matter
yesterday
i
would
have
blurted
out
to
him
the
whole
truth
decidedly
my
experiences
were
teaching
me
something
come
now
i
ca
fool
about
here
all
day
he
said
impatiently
tell
me
where
that
precious
master
of
yours
is
now
and
be
quicker
about
it
than
this
old
mule
maître
menard
then
had
told
them
nothing
staunch
old
loyalist
he
knew
perfectly
that
le
comte
had
gone
home
and
they
had
throttled
him
and
yet
he
had
not
told
well
he
should
not
lose
by
it
monsieur
is
about
the
streets
somewhere
on
my
life
i
know
not
where
but
i
know
he
will
be
back
here
to
supper
oh
you
do
know
do
you
then
perhaps
gaspard
can
quicken
your
memory
at
the
word
the
soldier
who
had
attended
to
maître
menard
came
over
to
me
and
taught
me
how
it
feels
to
be
hanged
i
said
to
myself
that
if
i
had
talked
like
a
dastard
i
was
not
one
and
every
time
he
let
me
speak
i
gasped
i
do
know
the
room
was
black
to
me
and
the
sea
roared
in
my
ears
and
i
wondered
whether
i
had
done
well
to
tell
the
lie
for
had
i
said
that
my
master
was
in
the
hôtel
st
quentin
still
those
fellows
would
have
found
it
no
easy
job
to
take
him
vigo
might
not
be
ready
to
defend
mlle
de
montluc
but
he
would
defend
monsieur
heir
to
the
last
gasp
yet
i
would
not
yield
before
the
choking
maître
menard
had
withstood
and
i
stuck
to
my
lie
then
i
bethought
me
while
the
room
reeled
about
me
and
my
head
seemed
like
to
burst
that
perchance
if
they
should
keep
me
here
a
captive
for
le
comte
arrival
he
might
really
follow
to
see
what
had
become
of
me
i
turned
sick
with
the
fear
of
it
and
resolved
on
the
truth
but
gaspard
last
had
robbed
me
of
the
power
to
speak
i
could
only
pant
and
choke
as
i
struggled
painfully
for
wind
the
door
was
flung
open
before
a
tall
young
man
in
black
through
the
haze
that
hung
before
my
vision
i
saw
the
soldier
seize
him
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
through
the
noise
of
waters
i
heard
the
captain
cry
of
triumph
oh
m
étienne
i
gasped
in
agony
that
my
pain
had
been
for
nothing
now
all
was
lost
then
the
blur
lifted
and
my
amazed
eyes
beheld
not
my
master
but
lucas
how
now
sirrah
he
cried
to
the
dragoon
hands
off
me
knaves
for
the
second
soldier
had
seized
his
other
arm
i
regret
to
inconvenience
monsieur
the
captain
answered
but
he
is
wanted
at
the
bastille
wanted
i
lucas
cried
fear
flashing
into
his
eyes
he
felt
an
instant
terror
i
deem
lest
mayenne
had
betrayed
him
quick
as
he
was
he
did
not
see
that
he
had
been
taken
for
another
man
you
monsieur
you
are
wanted
for
the
murder
of
your
man
pontou
he
grew
white
looking
instinctively
at
me
remembering
where
i
had
been
at
three
this
morning
it
is
a
lie
he
left
my
service
a
month
back
and
i
have
never
seen
him
since
tell
that
to
the
judges
the
captain
said
as
he
had
said
to
me
i
am
not
trying
you
the
handcuffs
men
one
of
them
produced
a
pair
lucas
struggled
frantically
in
his
grasp
he
dragged
them
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
calling
down
all
the
curses
of
heaven
upon
them
but
they
snapped
the
handcuffs
on
for
all
that
if
this
is
mayenne
work
he
panted
the
officer
caught
nothing
but
the
name
mayenne
the
boy
said
you
were
a
friend
to
his
grace
monsieur
but
orders
are
orders
i
have
the
warrant
for
your
arrest
from
de
belin
at
whose
instigation
how
should
i
know
i
am
a
soldier
of
the
guard
i
have
naught
to
do
with
it
but
to
arrest
you
let
me
see
the
warrant
i
am
not
obliged
to
but
i
will
though
it
may
quiet
your
bluster
he
took
out
the
warrant
and
held
it
at
a
safe
distance
before
eyes
a
great
light
broke
in
on
that
personage
mille
tonnerres
i
am
not
the
comte
de
mar
oh
you
say
that
now
do
you
pity
you
had
not
thought
of
it
sooner
but
i
am
not
the
comte
de
mar
i
am
paul
de
lorraine
nephew
to
my
lord
mayenne
why
do
you
say
straight
out
that
you
the
duc
de
guise
i
am
not
the
due
de
guise
lucas
returned
with
dignity
he
must
have
been
cursing
himself
that
he
had
not
given
his
name
sooner
but
i
am
his
brother
you
take
me
for
a
fool
aye
who
shall
hang
for
his
folly
you
must
think
me
a
fool
the
captain
repeated
the
duke
of
eldest
brother
is
but
seventeen
i
did
not
say
i
was
legitimate
oh
you
did
not
say
that
you
did
not
know
then
that
i
could
reel
off
the
ages
of
every
lorraine
of
them
all
no
de

i
am
not
so
simple
as
you
think
you
will
come
along
with
me
to
the
bastille
blockhead
i
have
you
broken
on
the
wheel
for
this
lucas
stormed
i
am
no
more

than
i

of
spain
speak
up
you
old
turnspit
he
shouted
to
maître
menard
am
i
he
poor
maître
menard
had
dropped
down
on
his
iron
box
too
limp
and
sick
to
know
what
was
going
on
he
only
stared
helplessly
speak
rascal
lucas
cried

mar
no
the
maître
answered
in
low
faltering
tones
he
was
at
the
last
point
of
pain
and
fear
no
monsieur
officer
it
is
as
he
says
he
is
not
the
comte
de
mar
who
is
he
then
i
know
not
the
maître
stammered
he
came
here
last
night
but
it
is
as
he
says
he
is
not
the
comte
de
mar
take
care
mine
host
the
officer
returned
you
lying
i
could
not
wonder
at
him
if
i
had
not
been
in
a
position
to
know
otherwise
i
had
thought
myself
the
maître
was
lying
if
you
had
spoken
at
first
i
might
have
believed
you
the
captain
said
bestowing
a
kick
on
him
get
out
of
here
old
ass
before
i
cram
your
lie
down
your
throat
and
clear
your
people
away
from
this
door
i
not
walk
through
a
mob
send
every
man
jack
about
his
business
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
him
and
every
woman
jill
too
le
capitaine
maître
menard
quavered
rising
unsteadily
to
his
feet
you
make
a
mistake
on
my
sacred
word
you
mistake
this
is
not
get
out
cried
the
captain
helping
him
along
with
his
boot
maître
menard
fell
rather
than
walked
out
of
the
door
a
gray
hue
came
over
lucas
face
his
first
fright
had
given
way
to
fury
at
perceiving
himself
the
victim
of
a
mistake
but
now
alarm
was
born
in
his
eyes
again
was
it
after
all
a
mistake
this
obstinate
disbelief
in
his
assertion
this
ordering
away
of
all
who
could
swear
to
his
identity
was
it
not
rather
a
plot
for
his
ruin
he
swallowed
hard
once
or
twice
fear
gripping
his
throat
harder
than
ever
the
fingers
had
gripped
mine
certainly
he
was
not
the
comte
de
mar
but
then
he
was
the
man
who
had
killed
pontou
if
this
is
a
plot
against
me
say
so
he
cried
if
you
have
orders
to
arrest
me
do
so
but
arrest
me
by
the
name
of
paul
de
lorraine
not
of
étienne
de
mar
the
name
of
étienne
de
mar
will
do
the
captain
returned
we
have
no
fancy
for
aliases
at
the
bastille
it
is
a
plot
lucas
cried
it
is
a
warrant
that
is
all
i
know
about
it
but
i
am
not
comte
de
mar
lucas
repeated
his
uneasy
conscience
had
numbed
his
wits
in
his
dread
of
a
plot
he
had
done
little
to
dissipate
an
error
but
now
he
pulled
himself
together
error
or
intention
he
would
act
as
if
he
knew
it
must
be
error
my
captain
you
have
made
a
mistake
likely
to
cost
you
your
i
tell
you
i
am
not
mar
the
landlord
who
knows
him
well
tells
you
i
am
not
mar
ask
those
who
know
de
mar
ask
these
inn
people
they
will
one
and
all
tell
you
i
am
not
he
ask
that
boy
there
even
he
dares
not
say
to
my
face
that
i
am
his
eyes
met
mine
and
i
could
see
that
even
in
the
moment
of
challenging
me
he
repented
he
believed
that
i
would
give
the
lie
but
the
dragoon
who
was
bending
over
him
relieving
him
of
his
spared
me
the
necessity
captain
you
need
give
yourself
no
uneasiness
this
is
the
comte
right
enough
i
live
in
the
quartier
marais
and
i
have
seen
this
gentleman
a
score
of
times
riding
with
de
st
quentin
lucas
at
this
unexpected
testimony
looked
so
taken
aback
that
the
captain
burst
out
laughing
yes
my
dear
monsieur
it
is
a
little
hard
for
de
nephew
you
are
a
nephew
are
you
not
to
explain
how
he
comes
to
ride
with
the
duc
de
st
quentin
it
was
awkward
to
explain
lucas
knowing
well
that
there
was
no
future
for
him
who
betrayed
the
generalissimo
secrets
cried
out
angrily
he
lies
i
never
rode
out
with
de
st
quentin
oh
come
now
really
you
waste
a
great
deal
of
breath
the
captain
said
i
regret
the
cruel
necessity
of
arresting
you
de
mar
but
there
is
nothing
gained
by
blustering
about
it
i
usually
know
what
i
am
about
you
do
not
know
nom
de
dieu
you
do
not
know
félix
broux
speak
up
there
if
you
have
told
him
behind
my
back
that
i
am
étienne
de
mar
i
defy
you
to
say
it
to
my
face
i
know
nothing
about
it
messieurs
i
repeated
my
little
refrain
monsieur
captain
remember
if
you
please
i
never
saw
him
till
yesterday
he
may
be
paul
de
lorraine
for
all
i
know
but
he
did
not
call
himself
that
yesterday
you
lucas
cried
go
tell
louis
to
drive
up
to
the
cabaret
door
gaspard
bade
the
captain
lucas
gazed
at
him
as
if
to
tear
out
of
him
the
truth
of
the
matter
i
think
he
was
still
a
prey
to
suspicion
of
a
plot
in
this
and
it
paralyzed
his
tongue
he
so
reeked
with
intrigue
that
he
smelled
one
wherever
he
went
he
was
much
too
clever
to
believe
that
this
arresting
officer
was
simply
i
say
no
more
he
cried
you
may
spare
yourself
your
lies
the
whole
crew
of
you
i
go
as
your
prisoner
but
i
go
as
paul
of
lorraine
son
of
henry
duke
of
guise
he
said
it
with
a
certain
superbness
but
the
young
captain
bourgeois
of
the
bourgeois
did
not
mean
to
let
himself
be
put
down
by
any
sprig
of
the
noblesse
certainly
if
it
is
any
comfort
to
you
he
retorted
but
you
are
very
dull
monsieur
not
to
be
aware
that
your
identity
is
known
perfectly
to
others
besides
your
lackey
here
and
my
man
i
did
not
come
to
arrest
you
without
a
minute
description
of
you
from
de
belin
himself
ventre
bleu
lucas
shouted
i
wrote
the
description
i
myself
lodged
information
against
mar
i
came
here
to
make
sure
you
took
him
carry
me
before
belin
he
will
know
me
i
trembled
lest
the
officer
could
not
but
see
that
the
man
spoke
truth
but
i
had
no
need
to
fear
there
is
a
combination
of
stupidity
and
vanity
which
nothing
can
move
i
have
no
orders
to
take
you
to
de
belin
he
returned
calmly
so
you
wrote
the
description
did
you
perhaps
you
will
deny
that
it
fits
you
he
read
from
the
paper
de
quentin
comte
de
mar
age
figure
tall
and
slender
was
dressed
yesterday
in
black
with
a
plain
carries
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
is
my
arm
in
a
sling
lucas
demanded
no
in
a
handcuff
the
captain
laughed
at
the
same
moment
that
his
dragoon
exclaimed
his
right
wrist
is
bandaged
though
that
is
nothing
it
is
a
mere
scratch
i
did
it
myself
last
night
by
accident
lucas
shouted
striving
with
his
hampered
left
hand
to
pull
the
folds
apart
to
show
it
but
he
could
not
and
fell
silent
like
one
who
sees
the
net
of
fate
drawing
in
about
him
the
captain
went
on
reading
from
his
little
paper
illustration
he
was
deposited
in
the
big
black
coach
hair
gray
eyes
aquiline
nose
i
suppose
you
will
still
tell
us
monsieur
that
you
are
not
the
man
i
am
not
he
the
comte
de
mar
and
i
are
nothing
alike
we
are
both
young
tall
yes
but
that
is
all
he
is
slashed
all
up
the
forearm
my
wrist
is
but
scratched
with
a
he
has
yellow
hair
mine
is
brown
his
eyes
it
is
plain
to
me
monsieur
the
officer
interrupted
that
the
description
fits
you
in
every
particular
and
so
it
did
i
who
had
heard
étienne
described
twenty
times
had
yesterday
mistaken
lucas
for
him
the
same
items
served
for
both
it
was
the
more
remarkable
because
they
actually
looked
no
more
alike
than
chalk
and
cheese
lucas
had
set
down
his
catalogue
without
a
thought
that
he
was
drawing
his
own
picture
if
ever
hunter
was
caught
in
his
own
gin
lucas
was
you
lie
he
cried
furiously
you
know
i
am
not
mar
you
lie
the
whole
pack
of
you
gag
him
ravelle
the
captain
commanded
with
an
angry
flush
i
demand
to
be
taken
before
de
belin
lucas
shouted
the
next
moment
the
soldier
had
twisted
a
handkerchief
about
his
mouth
ready
the
captain
asked
of
gaspard
who
had
come
back
just
in
time
to
aid
in
the
throttling
move
on
then
he
led
the
way
out
the
two
dragoons
following
with
their
prisoner
and
this
time
lucas
fertile
wits
failed
him
he
did
not
slip
from
his
captors
fingers
between
the
room
and
the
street
he
was
deposited
in
the
big
black
coach
that
had
aroused
my
wonder
louis
cracked
his
whip
and
off
they
rumbled
i
laughed
all
the
way
back
to
the
hôtel
quentin
xix
the
hôtel
de
i
found
étienne
sitting
on
the
steps
before
the
house
he
had
doffed
his
rusty
black
for
a
suit
of
azure
and
silver
his
sword
and
poniard
were
heavy
with
silver
chasings
his
blue
hat
its
white
plume
pinned
in
a
silver
buckle
lay
on
the
stone
beside
him
he
had
discarded
his
sling
and
was
engaged
in
tuning
a
lute
evidently
he
was
struck
by
some
change
in
my
appearance
for
he
asked
at
once
what
has
happened
félix
such
a
lark
i
cried
what
did
old
menard
share
the
crowns
with
you
for
your
trouble
no
he
pocketed
them
all
that
was
not
it
i
was
so
choked
with
laughter
as
to
make
it
hard
work
to
explain
what
was
it
while
his
first
bewilderment
changed
to
an
amazed
interest
which
in
its
turn
gave
way
not
to
delight
but
to
distress
mordieu
he
cried
starting
up
his
face
ablaze
if
i
resemble
that
dirt
as
chalk
and
cheese
i
said
no
one
seeing
you
both
could
possibly
mistake
you
for
two
of
the
same
race
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
catalogue
that
did
not
fit
him
it
mentioned
to
be
sure
the
right
arm
in
a
sling
his
was
not
but
he
had
his
wrist
bandaged
i
think
he
cut
himself
last
night
when
he
was
after
me
and
i
flung
the
door
in
his
face
for
afterward
he
held
his
hand
behind
his
back
at
any
rate
there
was
the
bandage
that
was
enough
to
satisfy
the
captain
and
they
took
him
off
truly
they
gagged
him
because
he
protested
so
much
and
lugged
him
off
to
the
bastille
he
demanded
as
if
he
could
scarcely
realize
the
event
to
the
bastille
in
a
big
between
the
officer
and
his
men
he
may
be
there
by
this
time
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
were
still
not
quite
able
to
believe
the
thing
it
is
true
monsieur
if
i
were
inventing
it
i
could
not
invent
anything
better
but
it
is
true
certes
you
could
not
invent
anything
better
nor
anything
half
so
good
if
ever
there
was
a
case
of
the
biter
bit
he
broke
off
laughing
monsieur
you
know
not
half
how
funny
it
was
had
you
seen
their
faces
the
more
lucas
swore
he
was
not
comte
de
mar
the
more
the
officer
was
sure
he
was
félix
you
have
all
the
luck
i
said
this
morning
you
should
go
about
no
more
without
me
then
i
send
you
off
on
a
stupid
errand
and
see
what
you
get
into
monsieur
i
put
it
to
you
had
you
been
there
how
could
lucas
have
been
arrested
for
comte
de
mar
he
wo
stay
arrested
long
more
the
pity
no
i
said
regretfully
but
they
may
keep
him
overnight
aye
he
may
be
out
of
mischief
overnight
i
am
happy
to
say
that
my
face
is
not
known
at
the
bastille
nor
his
i
take
it
i
thought
from
what
i
heard
last
night
that
he
had
never
been
in
paris
save
for
a
while
in
the
spring
when
he
lay
perdu
at
the
bastille
they
may
know
nothing
of
the
existence
of
a
paul
de
lorraine
but
monsieur
if
mayenne
has
broken
his
word
already
if
they
are
arresting
you
on
this
charge
you
must
get
out
of
the
gates
impossible
he
answered
smiling
i
have
an
engagement
in
paris
but
monsieur
may
not
keep
it
he
must
go
to
st
denis
i
must
go
nowhere
but
to
the
hôtel
lorraine
monsieur
why
look
you
félix
it
is
the
safest
spot
for
me
in
all
paris
it
is
the
last
place
where
they
will
look
for
me
besides
now
that
they
think
me
behind
bars
they
will
not
be
looking
for
me
at
all
i
shall
be
as
safe
as
the
hottest
leaguer
in
the
camp
but
in
the
be
comforted
i
shall
not
enter
the
hôtel
there
is
a
limit
to
my
madness
no
i
shall
go
softly
around
to
a
window
in
the
side
street
under
which
i
have
often
stood
in
the
old
days
she
used
to
contrive
to
be
in
her
chamber
after
supper
but
monsieur
how
long
is
it
since
you
were
there
last
i
think
it
must
be
two
months
i
had
little
heart
for
it
after
my
father
so
you
see
no
one
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
me
neither
will
mademoiselle
i
made
my
point
i
hope
she
may
he
answered
she
will
know
i
must
see
her
and
i
think
she
will
be
at
the
window
the
reasoning
seemed
satisfactory
to
him
and
i
thought
one
wet
blanket
in
the
house
was
enough
very
well
monsieur
i
am
ready
for
anything
you
propose
then
i
propose
supper
afterward
we
played
i
risking
the
pistoles
mademoiselle
had
given
me
i
won
five
more
for
he
paid
little
heed
to
what
he
was
about
but
was
ever
fidgeting
over
to
the
window
to
see
if
it
was
dark
enough
to
start
at
length
when
it
was
still
between
dog
and
wolf
he
announced
that
he
would
delay
no
longer
very
well
monsieur
i
said
with
all
alacrity
but
you
are
not
to
come
monsieur
certainly
not
i
must
go
alone
but
monsieur
you
will
need
me
you
will
need
some
one
to
watch
the
street
while
you
speak
with
mademoiselle
i
can
have
no
listener
he
replied
immovably
but
i
will
not
listen
monsieur
i
shall
stand
out
of
but
you
must
have
some
one
to
give
you
warning
should
the
guard
set
on
you
i
can
manage
my
own
affairs
he
retorted
haughtily
i
desire
neither
your
advice
nor
your
company
monsieur
i
cried
almost
in
tears
enough
he
bade
sharply
go
send
me
vigo
i
went
like
one
in
whose
face
the
doors
of
heaven
had
shut
vigo
came
at
once
from
the
at
my
summons
it
was
on
my
tongue
to
tell
him
of
le
comte
mad
resolve
to
fare
forth
alone
to
beg
him
to
stop
it
but
i
remembered
how
blameworthy
i
myself
had
held
the
equery
for
interfering
with
étienne
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
no
word
of
cavil
at
my
lord
should
ever
pass
my
lips
i
lagged
across
the
court
at
vigo
heels
silent
étienne
was
standing
in
the
doorway
vigo
he
said
without
a
change
of
countenance
get
félix
a
rapier
which
he
can
use
prettily
enough
i
can
not
take
him
out
unarmed
vigo
hesitated
a
moment
saluted
and
went
monsieur
i
cried
out
you
meant
all
the
time
to
take
me
he
gazed
down
on
my
heated
visage
and
laughed
and
laughed
félix
he
gasped
you
had
your
sport
over
there
at
the
inn
but
i
have
seen
nothing
this
summer
as
funny
as
face
vigo
came
back
with
a
sword
and
baldric
for
me
and
a
besides
but
étienne
would
not
let
me
have
it
circumstances
are
such
vigo
that
i
want
no
noisy
weapons
the
equery
regarded
him
with
a
troubled
countenance
i
wish
i
knew
monsieur
whether
i
do
right
to
let
you
go
we
will
not
discuss
that
an
it
please
you
i
do
not
monsieur
i
have
no
right
to
curtail
le
comte
liberties
but
i
let
you
go
with
a
heavy
heart
he
looked
after
us
with
foreboding
eyes
as
we
went
out
of
the
great
gate
alone
with
not
so
much
as
a
linkboy
but
if
his
heart
was
heavy
our
hearts
were
light
we
paced
along
as
merrily
as
though
to
a
feast
étienne
hung
his
lute
over
his
neck
and
strummed
it
and
whenever
we
passed
under
a
window
whence
leaned
a
pretty
head
he
sang
snatches
of
we
were
alone
in
the
dark
streets
of
a
hostile
city
bound
for
the
house
of
a
mighty
foe
and
one
of
us
was
wounded
and
one
a
tyro
yet
we
laughed
as
we
went
for
there
was
lucas
languishing
in
prison
and
here
were
we
free
as
air
steering
our
course
for
window
one
of
us
was
in
love
and
the
other
wore
a
sword
for
the
first
time
and
all
the
power
of
mayenne
daunted
us
not
we
came
at
length
within
of
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
where
étienne
was
willing
to
abate
somewhat
his
swagger
we
left
the
rue
antoine
creeping
around
behind
the
house
through
a
narrow
and
twisting
alley
it
was
but
he
knew
the
way
well
into
a
little
street
from
the
windows
of
the
houses
upon
it
it
was
only
a
few
rods
long
running
from
the
open
square
in
front
of
the
hôtel
to
the
network
of
unpaved
alleys
behind
on
the
farther
side
stood
a
row
of
houses
their
doors
opening
directly
on
the
pavement
on
this
side
was
but
one
big
pile
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
the
wall
was
broken
by
few
windows
most
of
them
dark
this
was
not
the
gay
side
of
the
house
the
overhanging
turret
on
the
low
second
story
under
which
étienne
halted
was
as
dark
as
the
rest
nor
though
the
casement
was
open
wide
could
we
tell
whether
any
one
was
in
the
room
we
could
hear
nothing
but
the
breeze
crackling
in
the
silken
curtains
take
your
station
at
the
corner
there
he
bade
and
shout
if
they
seem
to
be
coming
for
us
but
i
think
we
shall
not
be
molested
my
fingers
are
so
stiff
they
will
hardly
recognize
my
hand
on
the
strings
i
went
to
my
post
and
he
began
singing
scarce
loud
enough
for
any
but
his
lady
above
to
mark
him
blossom
ever
grew
once
she
loosened
from
her
breast
this
i
say
her
eyes
are
blue
from
her
breast
the
rose
she
drew
dole
for
me
her
servant
blest
fairest
blossom
ever
the
music
paused
and
i
turned
from
my
watch
of
the
shadowy
figures
crossing
the
square
in
instant
alarm
lest
something
was
wrong
but
whatever
startled
him
ceased
for
in
a
moment
he
went
on
again
and
as
he
sang
his
voice
rang
fuller
my
love
the
guerdon
true
is
my
bosom
only
guest
this
i
say
her
eyes
are
blue
still
to
me
is
bright
of
hue
as
when
first
my
kisses
prest
fairest
blossom
ever
grew
sweeter
than
when
gathered
new
was
the
sign
her
love
confest
this
i
say
her
eyes
are
he
stopped
again
and
stood
gazing
up
into
the
window
but
whether
he
saw
something
or
heard
something
i
could
not
tell
apparently
he
was
not
sure
himself
for
presently
a
little
tremulous
he
added
the
four
verses
thou
of
me
a
clue
to
that
lady
i
love
best
fairest
blossom
ever
grew
this
i
say
her
eyes
are
he
doffed
his
hat
pushing
back
the
hair
from
his
brow
and
waited
eager
hopeful
there
was
a
little
stir
in
the
room
that
one
thought
was
not
the
wind
i
had
come
unconsciously
up
the
street
to
him
in
the
ardour
of
my
interest
but
now
i
was
startled
back
to
my
duty
by
the
sound
of
men
running
round
the
corner
behind
me
one
glance
was
enough
two
abreast
swords
in
hand
they
were
charging
us
i
ran
before
them
drawing
blade
as
i
went
and
shouting
to
étienne
but
even
as
i
called
an
answering
shout
came
from
the
alley
two
men
of
the
spanish
guards
shot
out
of
the
darkness
and
at
us
étienne
with
his
extraordinary
quickness
had
got
the
lute
off
his
neck
and
now
for
want
of
a
better
use
of
it
flung
it
at
the
head
of
his
nearest
assailant
who
received
it
full
in
the
face
stopped
hesitated
a
moment
and
ran
back
the
way
he
had
come
but
three
foes
remained
with
the
whole
hôtel
de
lorraine
behind
them
we
put
our
backs
to
the
wall
and
set
to
the
remaining
spaniard
engaged
me
étienne
protected
somewhat
in
the
embrasure
of
a
doorway
held
at
bay
with
his
good
left
arm
a
pair
of
attackers
these
were
in
the
dress
of
gentlemen
and
wore
masks
as
if
their
cheeks
blushed
well
they
might
for
the
deeds
of
their
hands
a
broad
window
in
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
was
flung
open
a
man
leaned
far
out
with
a
torch
the
bright
glare
in
our
faces
bewildered
our
eyes
i
could
not
see
what
i
was
about
and
rammed
my
point
against
my
spaniard
hilt
snapping
my
blade
the
sudden
impact
sent
him
stumbling
back
a
pace
and
étienne
who
with
the
quick
eye
of
the
born
fencer
saw
everything
cried
to
me
here
i
darted
back
into
the
doorway
beside
him
his
two
assailants
finding
that
they
gained
nothing
by
their
joint
attack
but
rather
hampered
each
other
one
dropped
back
to
watch
his
comrade
the
cleverer
swordsman
this
was
decidedly
a
man
of
talent
but
he
was
shorter
in
the
arm
than
my
master
and
had
the
disadvantage
of
standing
on
the
ground
whereas
étienne
was
up
one
step
he
could
not
force
home
any
of
his
thrusts
nor
could
he
drive
étienne
out
of
his
coign
to
where
in
the
open
the
two
could
make
short
work
of
him
the
rapiers
clashed
and
parted
and
twisted
about
each
other
and
flew
apart
again
and
then
before
i
could
see
who
was
touched
the
attacker
fell
to
his
knees
with
étienne
sword
in
his
breast
étienne
wrenched
the
blade
out
the
wounded
man
sank
backward
his
breaking
he
was
the
one
whom
i
had
thought
him
françois
de
brie
étienne
was
ready
for
the
second
gentleman
but
neither
he
nor
the
soldier
attacked
the
in
the
window
with
a
shout
waved
his
arm
toward
the
square
a
mob
of
armed
men
hurled
itself
around
the
corner
a
pikeman
with
lowered
point
in
the
van
this
was
not
combat
it
was
butchery
étienne
with
a
little
moan
lifted
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
from
his
assailant
to
the
turret
window
in
the
same
instant
i
felt
the
door
behind
us
give
throwing
my
whole
weight
upon
it
i
seized
étienne
and
pulled
him
over
the
threshold
some
one
inside
slammed
the
door
to
just
as
the
spaniard
hurled
himself
against
it
xx
on
guard
monsieur
we
found
ourselves
in
a
narrow
panelled
passageway
lighted
by
a
flickering
pendent
from
a
bracket
confronting
us
was
our
preserver
a
little
old
lady
in
black
velvet
leaning
back
in
chuckling
triumph
against
the
shot
bolts
she
was
very
small
and
very
old
her
figure
was
bent
and
shrunken
a
pitiful
little
bag
of
bones
in
a
rich
dress
her
hair
was
as
white
as
her
ruff
her
skin
as
yellow
and
dry
as
parchment
furrowed
with
a
thousand
wrinkles
but
her
black
eyes
sparkled
like
a
girl
i
did
not
mean
to
let
my
nightingale
throat
be
slit
she
cried
in
a
shrill
voice
quavering
like
a
young
child
i
have
listened
to
your
singing
many
a
night
monsieur
i
was
glad
to
find
the
nightingale
back
again
when
i
saw
that
crew
rush
at
you
i
said
i
would
save
you
if
only
you
would
put
your
back
to
my
door
monsieur
you
are
a
young
man
of
intelligence
i
am
a
young
man
of
amazing
good
fortune
madame
étienne
replied
with
his
handsomest
bow
sheathing
his
wet
blade
i
owe
you
a
debt
of
gratitude
which
is
ill
repaid
in
the
base
coin
of
bringing
trouble
to
this
house
not
at
all
not
at
all
she
protested
with
animation
no
one
is
likely
to
molest
this
house
it
is
the
dwelling
of
m
ferou
of
the
sixteen
of
the
sixteen
she
nodded
her
shrewd
face
agleam
with
mischief
in
truth
if
my
son
were
within
you
were
little
likely
to
find
harbourage
here
but
as
it
is
he
and
his
wife
are
supping
with
his
grace
of
lyons
and
the
servants
are
one
and
all
gone
to
mass
leaving
madame
to
shift
for
herself
no
no
my
good
friends
you
may
knock
till
you
drop
but
you
wo
get
in
the
attacking
party
was
indeed
hammering
energetically
on
the
door
shouting
to
us
to
open
to
deny
them
at
our
peril
the
eyes
of
the
old
lady
glittered
with
new
delight
at
every
rap
i
fancy
they
will
think
twice
before
they
batter
down
ferou
door
ma
foi
i
fancy
they
are
a
little
mystified
at
finding
you
sanctuaried
in
this
house
was
it
not
my
lord
mayenne
jackal
françois
de
brie
yes
and
marc
latour
i
thought
i
knew
them
she
cried
in
evident
pride
at
her
sharpness
it
was
dark
and
they
were
masked
and
my
eyes
are
old
but
i
knew
them
and
which
of
the
ladies
is
it
he
could
do
no
less
than
answer
his
saviour
ah
well
she
said
with
a
little
sigh
i
too
once
but
that
is
a
long
time
ago
then
her
eyes
twinkled
again
i
trow
she
was
not
much
given
to
sighing
that
is
a
long
time
ago
she
repeated
briskly
and
now
they
think
i
am
too
old
to
do
aught
but
tell
my
beads
and
wait
for
death
but
i
like
to
have
a
hand
in
the
game
i
will
come
to
take
a
hand
with
you
any
time
madame
étienne
assured
her
i
like
the
way
you
play
she
broke
into
shrill
delighted
laughter
i
warrant
you
do
and
i
do
mean
to
do
the
thing
by
halves
no
i
shall
save
you
hide
and
hair
be
so
kind
my
lad
as
to
lift
the
lantern
from
the
hook
i
did
as
she
bade
me
and
we
followed
her
down
the
passage
like
spaniels
she
was
so
entirely
equal
to
the
situation
that
we
made
no
protests
and
asked
no
questions
at
the
end
of
the
hall
she
paused
opening
neither
the
door
on
the
right
nor
the
door
on
the
left
but
passing
her
hand
up
one
of
the
panels
of
the
wainscot
suddenly
she
flung
it
wide
you
are
not
so
small
as
i
she
chuckled
yet
i
think
you
can
make
shift
to
get
through
you
monsieur
go
first
i
doubled
myself
up
and
scrambled
through
the
old
lady
gathering
her
petticoats
daintily
followed
me
without
difficulty
but
étienne
was
put
to
some
trouble
to
bow
his
tall
head
low
enough
we
stood
at
the
top
of
a
flight
of
stone
steps
descending
into
blackness
the
old
lady
unhesitatingly
tripped
down
before
us
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
was
a
vaulted
stone
passageway
slippery
with
lichen
the
dampness
hanging
in
beads
on
the
wall
turning
two
corners
we
brought
up
at
a
narrow
door
here
i
bid
you
farewell
quoth
the
little
old
lady
you
have
only
to
walk
on
till
you
get
to
the
end
at
the
steps
pull
the
rope
once
and
wait
when
he
opens
to
you
say
the
cause
and
draw
a
crown
with
your
finger
in
the
air
madame
étienne
cried
i
hope
the
day
may
come
when
i
shall
make
you
suitable
acknowledgements
my
name
i
prefer
not
to
know
it
she
interrupted
glancing
up
at
him
i
will
call
you
that
is
enough
as
for
acknowledgments
pooh
i
am
overpaid
in
the
sport
it
has
been
but
madame
when
monsieur
your
son
discovers
mon
dieu
i
am
not
afraid
of
my
son
or
of
any
other
woman
son
she
cried
with
cackling
laughter
and
i
warrant
she
was
not
madame
étienne
said
i
trust
we
shall
meet
again
when
i
shall
have
time
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
he
dropped
on
his
knees
before
her
kissing
both
her
hands
yes
yes
of
course
you
are
grateful
she
said
somewhat
bored
apparently
by
his
demonstration
naturally
one
does
not
like
to
die
at
your
age
i
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
and
you
too
you
boy
give
me
back
my
lantern
and
fare
you
well
you
will
let
us
see
you
safe
back
in
your
hall
i
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
i
am
not
so
decrepit
thank
you
that
i
can
not
get
up
my
own
stairs
no
no
no
more
gallantries
but
get
on
your
way
begone
with
you
i
must
be
back
in
my
chamber
working
my
when
my
comes
home
crowing
her
elfin
laugh
she
pulled
the
door
open
and
fairly
hustled
us
through
you
are
fine
boys
and
she
slammed
the
door
upon
us
we
were
in
absolute
darkness
as
we
took
our
first
breath
of
the
dank
foul
air
we
heard
bolts
snap
into
place
well
since
we
can
not
go
back
let
us
go
forward
said
étienne
cheerfully
i
am
glad
she
has
bolted
the
door
it
is
to
throw
them
off
the
scent
should
they
track
us
i
knew
very
well
that
he
was
not
at
all
glad
that
the
same
thought
which
chilled
my
blood
had
come
to
him
this
little
beldam
with
her
beady
eyes
and
her
laughter
was
the
wicked
witch
of
our
childhood
days
she
had
shut
us
up
in
a
to
die
i
heard
him
tapping
the
pavement
before
him
with
his
scabbard
using
it
as
a
blind
man
staff
and
so
we
advanced
through
the
fetid
gloom
the
passage
being
only
wide
enough
to
let
us
walk
shoulder
to
shoulder
there
was
a
whirring
of
wings
about
us
and
a
squeaking
once
something
swooped
square
into
my
face
knocking
a
cry
of
terror
from
me
and
a
laugh
from
him
what
was
it
a
bat
cheer
up
félix
they
do
bite
but
i
would
not
go
on
till
i
had
made
sure
as
well
as
i
could
without
seeing
that
the
cursed
thing
was
not
clinging
on
me
somewhere
we
walked
on
then
in
silence
the
stone
walls
vibrant
with
our
tread
we
went
on
till
it
seemed
we
had
traversed
the
width
of
paris
and
i
wondered
who
were
sleeping
and
feasting
and
scheming
and
loving
over
our
heads
étienne
said
at
length
mordieu
i
hope
this
does
not
empty
us
out
into
the
seine
but
i
thought
that
as
long
as
it
emptied
us
out
somewhere
i
should
not
greatly
mind
the
seine
at
this
very
moment
étienne
clutched
my
arm
jerking
me
to
a
halt
i
bounded
backward
trying
in
the
blackness
to
discern
a
precipice
yawning
at
my
feet
look
he
cried
in
a
low
tense
voice
i
perceived
far
before
us
in
the
gloom
a
point
of
light
which
as
we
watched
it
grew
bigger
and
bigger
till
it
became
an
approaching
lantern
this
is
like
to
be
awkward
murmured
étienne
the
man
carrying
the
light
came
on
with
firm
heavy
tread
naturally
he
did
not
see
us
as
soon
as
we
saw
him
i
thought
him
alone
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
in
this
dark
echoy
place
he
might
easily
have
approached
within
touch
of
my
sad
clothing
without
becoming
aware
of
me
but
étienne
azure
and
white
caught
the
lantern
rays
a
rod
away
the
newcomer
stopped
short
holding
up
the
light
between
us
and
his
face
we
could
make
nothing
of
him
save
that
he
was
a
large
man
soberly
clad
who
is
it
he
demanded
his
voice
ringing
out
loud
and
steady
is
it
you
ferou
étienne
hooked
his
scabbard
in
place
and
went
forward
into
the
clear
circle
of
light
no
de
mayenne
it
is
étienne
de
mar
ventre
bleu
mayenne
ejaculated
changing
his
lantern
with
comical
alacrity
to
his
left
hand
and
whipping
out
his
sword
my
master
came
bare
too
at
that
they
confronted
each
other
in
silence
till
mayenne
astonishment
forced
the
cry
from
him
how
the
devil
come
you
here
evidently
by
way
of
ferou
house
étienne
answered
mayenne
still
stared
in
thick
amazement
after
a
moment
my
master
added
i
must
in
justice
say
that
ferou
is
not
aware
that
i
am
using
this
passage
he
is
with
madame
his
wife
supping
with
the
archbishop
of
lyons
étienne
leaned
his
shoulder
against
the
wall
smiling
pleasantly
and
waiting
for
the
duke
to
make
the
next
move
mayenne
kept
a
nonplussed
silence
the
situation
was
indeed
somewhat
awkward
he
could
not
come
forward
without
encountering
an
agile
opponent
whose
exceeding
skill
with
the
sword
was
probably
known
to
him
he
could
not
turn
tail
had
his
dignity
allowed
the
course
without
exposing
himself
to
be
spitted
he
was
in
the
predicament
of
the
goat
on
the
bridge
yet
was
he
gaping
at
us
less
in
fear
i
think
than
in
bewilderment
this
ferou
as
i
learned
later
was
one
of
his
men
supporter
mayenne
had
as
soon
expected
to
meet
a
lion
in
the
tunnel
as
to
meet
a
foe
he
cried
out
again
upon
us
with
an
instinctive
certainty
that
a
great
prince
question
must
be
answered
how
came
you
here
i
do
ask
said
étienne
how
it
happens
that
le
duc
is
walking
through
this
nor
do
i
feel
disposed
to
make
any
explanation
to
him
very
well
then
said
mayenne
our
swords
if
you
are
ready
will
make
adequate
explanation
now
that
is
gallant
of
you
returned
étienne
as
it
is
evident
that
the
closeness
of
these
walls
will
inconvenience
your
grace
more
than
it
will
me
the
walls
of
the
passage
were
roughly
laid
mayenne
perched
his
lantern
on
a
projecting
stone
on
guard
sir
he
answered
the
silence
was
profound
mayenne
had
no
companion
following
him
he
was
alone
with
his
sword
he
was
not
now
head
of
the
state
but
only
a
man
with
a
sword
standing
opposite
another
man
with
a
sword
nor
was
he
in
the
pink
of
form
though
he
gave
the
effect
from
his
clear
colour
and
proud
bearing
perhaps
also
from
his
masterful
energy
of
tremendous
force
and
strength
his
body
was
in
truth
but
a
poor
machine
his
great
corpulence
making
him
clumsy
and
scant
of
breath
he
must
have
known
as
he
eyed
his
supple
antagonist
what
the
end
would
be
yet
he
merely
said
on
guard
monsieur
étienne
did
not
raise
his
weapon
i
retreated
a
pace
that
i
might
not
be
in
the
way
of
his
jump
should
mayenne
spring
on
him
étienne
said
slowly
de
mayenne
this
encounter
was
none
of
my
contriving
nor
have
i
any
wish
to
cross
swords
with
you
family
quarrels
are
to
be
deprecated
since
i
still
intend
to
become
your
cousin
i
must
respectfully
beg
to
be
released
from
the
obligation
of
fighting
you
a
man
knowing
himself
overmatched
can
not
refuse
combat
he
may
even
as
mayenne
had
done
think
himself
compelled
to
offer
it
but
if
he
insists
on
forcing
battle
with
a
reluctant
adversary
he
must
be
a
hothead
indeed
and
mayenne
was
no
hothead
he
stood
hesitant
feeling
that
he
was
made
ridiculous
in
accepting
the
clemency
and
should
be
still
more
ridiculous
to
refuse
it
he
half
lifted
his
sword
only
to
lower
it
again
till
at
last
his
good
sense
came
to
his
relief
in
a
laugh
de
mar
it
appears
that
after
all
some
explanations
are
necessary
you
think
that
in
declining
to
fight
you
put
me
in
your
debt
possibly
you
are
right
but
if
you
expect
that
in
gratitude
i
shall
hand
over
lorance
de
montluc
you
were
never
more
mistaken
never
while
i
live
shall
she
marry
into
the
king
camp
now
monsieur
that
we
understand
each
other
i
abide
by
your
decision
whether
we
fight
or
not
for
answer
étienne
put
up
his
blade
the
duke
of
mayenne
saluting
with
his
did
the
like
mar
he
said
you
stood
off
from
us
like
a
coquetting
girl
for
three
years
at
length
last
may
you
refused
to
join
us
i
do
not
often
ask
a
man
twice
but
i
ask
you
will
you
join
the
league
and
marry
lorance
no
man
could
have
spoken
with
a
franker
grace
i
believe
then
i
believe
now
he
meant
it
étienne
believed
he
meant
it
monsieur
he
answered
i
have
long
but
i
am
planted
squarely
at
last
with
my
father
on
the
king
side
you
put
your
interesting
nephew
into
my
father
house
to
kill
him
i
shall
not
sign
myself
with
the
league
in
that
case
returned
mayenne
perhaps
we
might
each
continue
on
his
way
with
all
my
heart
monsieur
each
drew
back
against
the
wall
to
let
the
other
pass
with
a
wary
eye
for
daggers
then
étienne
laughing
a
little
but
watching
mayenne
like
a
lynx
started
to
go
by
the
duke
seeing
the
look
suddenly
raised
his
hands
over
his
head
holding
them
there
while
both
of
us
squeezed
past
him
cousin
charles
said
étienne
i
see
that
when
i
have
married
lorance
you
and
i
shall
get
on
capitally
till
then
god
have
you
ever
in
guard
i
thank
you
monsieur
you
make
me
immortal
i
have
no
need
to
make
you
witty
de
mayenne
when
you
have
submitted
to
the
king
as
you
will
one
of
these
days
i
shall
have
as
delightful
a
kinsman
as
heart
of
man
could
wish
you
and
i
will
yet
drink
a
together
till
that
happy
hour
i
am
your
good
enemy
fare
you
well
monsieur
he
bowed
the
duke
half
laughing
despite
a
considerable
ire
returned
the
obeisance
with
all
pomp
étienne
took
me
by
the
arm
and
departed
mayenne
stood
still
for
a
space
then
we
heard
his
retreating
footsteps
and
the
glimmer
of
his
light
slowly
faded
away
illustration
we
climbed
out
into
a
shop
it
was
necessary
to
tell
him
the
door
is
bolted
étienne
muttered
we
hurried
along
now
without
precaution
knowing
that
the
floor
which
had
supported
mayenne
would
support
us
the
consequence
was
that
we
stumbled
abruptly
against
a
step
and
fell
with
a
force
like
to
break
our
kneecaps
i
picked
myself
up
at
once
and
ran
headlong
up
the
stairs
to
hit
my
crown
on
the
ceiling
and
reel
back
on
étienne
sweeping
him
off
his
feet
so
that
we
rolled
in
a
struggling
heap
on
the
stones
of
the
passage
and
for
the
minute
the
place
was
no
longer
dark
i
saw
more
lightning
than
even
flashed
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
are
you
hurt
félix
cried
étienne
the
first
to
disentangle
himself
no
i
said
groaning
but
i
banged
my
head
she
did
not
say
it
was
a
we
ascended
the
stairs
a
second
time
this
time
most
cautiously
on
our
hands
and
knees
above
us
at
the
end
we
could
feel
with
upleaping
of
spirit
a
wooden
ceiling
ah
i
have
the
cord
he
exclaimed
the
next
instant
we
heard
a
faint
but
most
comforting
tinkle
somewhere
above
us
before
we
had
time
to
wonder
whether
any
marked
it
but
us
we
heard
steps
overhead
and
a
noise
as
of
a
chest
being
pulled
about
and
then
the
trap
lifted
we
climbed
out
into
a
shop
faith
my
man
said
étienne
to
the
little
bourgeois
who
had
opened
to
us
i
am
glad
to
see
you
appear
so
promptly
he
looked
at
us
somewhat
troubled
or
alarmed
you
must
have
met
he
suggested
with
hesitancy
yes
said
étienne
but
he
did
not
object
we
are
of
course
of
the
initiated
of
course
of
course
the
little
fellow
assented
with
a
funny
assumption
of
knowing
all
about
it
not
every
one
has
the
secret
of
the
passage
well
i
can
call
myself
a
lucky
man
is
mighty
few
mercers
have
a
duke
in
their
shop
as
often
as
i
we
looked
curiously
about
us
the
shop
was
low
and
dim
with
piles
of
stuff
in
rolls
on
the
shelves
and
other
stuffs
lying
loose
on
the
counter
before
us
as
if
the
man
had
just
been
measuring
them
gorgeous
brocades
and
satins
above
us
a
bell
on
the
rafter
still
quivered
yes
that
is
the
bell
of
the
trap
the
proprietor
said
following
our
glance
customers
do
not
know
where
it
rings
from
and
if
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
open
i
drop
my
brass
yardstick
on
the
floor
but
they
told
you
that
doubtless
monsieur
he
added
regarding
étienne
again
a
little
uneasily
they
told
me
something
else
i
had
near
forgotten
étienne
answered
and
drawing
a
crown
in
the
air
gave
the
password
for
the
cause
for
the
king
the
shopkeeper
made
instant
rejoinder
drawing
in
the
air
in
his
turn
a
letter
c
and
the
numeral
étienne
laid
a
gold
piece
on
the
counter
and
if
the
shopkeeper
had
felt
any
doubts
of
this
gallant
who
wore
no
hat
they
vanished
in
its
radiance
and
now
my
friend
let
us
out
into
the
street
and
forget
our
faces
the
man
took
up
his
candle
to
light
us
to
the
door
perhaps
it
would
not
trouble
monsieur
to
say
a
word
for
me
over
there
he
suggested
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
tunnel
le
duc
has
every
confidence
in
me
still
it
would
do
no
harm
if
monsieur
should
mention
how
quickly
i
let
him
out
when
i
see
him
i
will
surely
mention
it
étienne
promised
him
continue
to
be
vigilant
my
friend
there
is
another
man
to
come
followed
by
the
little
bourgeois
thanks
and
adieus
we
walked
out
into
the
sweet
open
air
as
soon
as
his
door
was
shut
again
we
took
to
our
heels
nor
stopped
running
till
we
had
put
half
a
dozen
streets
between
us
and
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
then
we
walked
along
in
breathless
silence
presently
étienne
cried
out
death
of
my
life
had
i
fought
there
in
the
burrow
i
should
have
changed
the
history
of
france
xxi
chance
the
street
before
us
was
as
orderly
as
the
aisle
of
notre
dame
few
passed
us
those
there
were
talked
together
as
placidly
as
if
and
mêlées
existed
not
and
tunnels
and
countersigns
were
but
the
smoke
of
a
dream
it
was
a
street
of
shops
all
shuttered
while
above
the
burghers
families
went
respectably
to
bed
this
is
the
rue
de
la
ferronnerie
my
master
said
pausing
a
moment
to
take
his
bearings
see
under
the
lantern
the
sign
of
the
pierced
heart
the
little
shop
is
in
the
rue
de
la
soierie
we
are
close
by
the
halles
we
must
have
come
half
a
mile
underground
well
we
swing
about
in
a
circle
to
get
home
for
this
night
i
had
enough
of
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
and
i
but
i
held
my
tongue
about
it
as
became
me
they
were
wider
awake
than
i
thought
those
lorrainers
pardieu
féix
you
and
i
came
closer
quarters
with
death
than
is
entirely
amusing
if
that
door
had
not
i
shuddered
a
new
saint
in
the
calendar
la
sainte
ferou
but
what
a
madcap
of
a
saint
then
my
faith
she
must
have
led
them
a
dance
when
francis
i
was
king
natheless
it
galls
me
he
went
on
half
to
himself
to
know
that
i
was
lost
by
my
own
folly
saved
by
pure
chance
i
underrated
the
enemy
worst
mistake
in
the
book
of
strategy
i
came
near
flinging
away
two
lives
and
making
a
most
unsightly
mess
under
a
lady
window
monsieur
made
somewhat
of
a
mess
as
it
was
aye
i
would
i
knew
whether
i
killed
brie
we
go
round
in
the
morning
and
find
out
i
am
thankful
that
monsieur
does
not
mean
to
go
not
félix
i
had
enough
no
we
get
home
without
passing
near
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
if
we
go
outside
the
walls
to
do
it
i
draw
my
sword
no
more
to
this
day
i
have
no
quite
clear
idea
of
how
we
went
a
strange
city
at
night
paris
of
all
cities
is
a
labyrinth
i
know
that
after
a
time
we
came
out
in
some
meadows
along
the
traversed
them
and
plunged
once
more
into
narrow
streets
it
was
very
late
and
lights
were
few
we
had
started
in
clear
starlight
but
now
a
rack
of
clouds
hid
even
their
pale
shine
the
over
again
said
étienne
but
we
are
almost
at
our
own
gates
but
as
in
the
came
light
turning
a
sharp
corner
we
ran
straight
into
a
gentleman
and
his
swinging
along
at
as
smart
a
pace
as
we
a
thousand
pardons
étienne
cried
to
his
encounterer
the
possessor
of
years
and
gravity
but
of
no
great
size
whom
he
had
almost
knocked
down
i
heard
you
but
knew
not
you
were
so
close
we
were
speeding
to
get
home
the
personage
was
also
of
a
portliness
and
the
collision
had
knocked
the
wind
out
of
him
he
leaned
panting
against
the
wall
as
he
scanned
étienne
open
countenance
and
princely
dress
his
alarm
vanished
it
is
unseemly
to
go
about
on
a
night
like
this
without
a
lantern
he
said
with
asperity
the
municipality
should
forbid
it
i
shall
certainly
bring
the
matter
up
at
the
next
sitting
monsieur
is
a
member
of
the
parliament
étienne
asked
with
immense
respect
i
have
that
honour
monsieur
the
little
man
replied
delighted
to
impress
us
as
he
himself
was
impressed
by
the
sense
of
his
importance
oh
said
étienne
with
increasing
solemnity
perhaps
monsieur
had
a
hand
in
a
certain
decree
of
the
june
the
little
man
began
to
look
uneasy
there
was
as
monsieur
says
a
measure
passed
that
day
he
stammered
a
rebellious
and
contumacious
decree
étienne
rejoined
most
offensive
to
the
whereupon
he
fingered
his
sword
monsieur
the
little
deputy
cried
we
meant
no
offence
to
his
grace
or
to
any
true
frenchman
we
but
desire
peace
after
all
these
years
of
blood
we
were
informed
that
his
grace
was
angry
yet
we
believed
that
even
he
will
come
to
see
the
matter
in
a
different
light
you
have
acted
in
a
manner
insulting
to
his
grace
of
mayenne
étienne
repeated
inexorably
and
he
glanced
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
to
make
sure
the
coast
was
clear
the
wretched
little
teeth
chattered
the
linkman
had
retreated
to
the
other
side
of
the
way
where
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
fleeing
leaving
his
master
to
his
fate
i
thought
it
would
be
a
shame
if
the
badgered
deputy
had
to
stumble
home
in
the
dark
so
i
growled
out
to
the
fellow
stir
one
step
at
your
peril
i
was
afraid
he
would
drop
the
flambeau
and
run
but
he
did
not
he
only
sank
back
against
the
wall
eyeing
my
sword
with
exceeding
deference
he
knew
not
that
there
was
but
a
foot
of
blade
in
the
scabbard
the
burgher
looked
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
after
example
but
there
was
no
help
to
be
seen
or
heard
he
turned
to
his
tormentor
with
the
valour
of
a
mouse
at
bay
monsieur
beware
what
you
do
i
am
pierre
marceau
oh
you
are
pierre
marceau
and
can
pierre
marceau
explain
how
he
happened
to
be
faring
forth
from
his
dwelling
at
this
unholy
hour
i
am
not
faring
forth
i
am
faring
home
i
we
had
a
little
con
that
is
not
to
say
a
conference
but
merely
a
little
discussion
on
matters
of
no
importance
i
have
the
pleasure
interrupted
étienne
sternly
of
knowing
where
marceau
lives
marceau
errand
in
this
direction
is
not
accounted
for
but
i
was
going
home
on
my
sacred
honour
i
was
ask
jacques
else
but
as
we
went
down
the
rue
de
we
saw
two
men
in
front
of
us
as
they
reached
the
wall
by
de
mirabeau
garden
a
gang
of
footpads
fell
on
them
the
two
drew
blades
and
defended
themselves
but
the
ruffians
were
a
dozen
a
score
we
ran
for
our
lives
étienne
wheeled
round
to
me
félix
here
is
work
for
us
as
i
was
saying
marceau
your
decree
is
most
offensive
to
the
and
therefore
since
he
is
my
particular
enemy
most
pleasing
to
me
a
beautiful
night
is
it
not
sir
i
wish
you
a
delightful
walk
home
he
seized
me
by
the
hand
and
we
dashed
up
the
street
at
the
corner
the
noise
of
a
fray
came
faintly
but
plainly
to
our
ears
le
comte
without
hesitation
plunged
down
a
lane
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
i
said
i
wanted
no
more
fighting
but
two
against
a
mob
we
know
how
it
feels
the
clash
of
steel
on
steel
grew
ever
louder
and
as
we
wheeled
around
a
jutting
garden
wall
we
came
full
upon
the
combatants
a
rescue
a
rescue
cried
étienne
shout
félix
montjoie
denis
a
rescue
a
rescue
we
charged
down
the
street
drawing
our
swords
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
our
lungs
it
was
too
dark
to
see
much
save
a
mass
of
struggling
figures
with
every
now
and
then
as
the
steel
hit
a
point
of
light
flashing
out
to
fade
and
appear
again
like
a
brilliant
we
could
scarce
tell
which
were
the
attackers
which
the
two
comrades
we
had
come
to
save
but
if
we
could
not
make
them
out
neither
could
they
us
we
shouted
as
boldly
as
if
we
had
been
a
company
and
in
the
clatter
of
their
heels
on
the
stones
they
could
not
count
our
feet
they
knew
not
how
many
followers
the
darkness
held
the
group
parted
two
men
remained
in
hot
combat
close
under
the
left
wall
across
the
way
one
sturdy
fighter
held
off
two
while
a
sixth
man
crying
on
his
mates
to
follow
fled
down
the
lane
étienne
knew
now
what
he
was
about
and
at
once
took
sides
with
the
solitary
fencer
the
combat
being
made
equal
i
started
in
pursuit
of
the
flying
figure
i
had
run
but
a
few
yards
however
when
i
tripped
and
fell
prostrate
over
the
body
of
a
man
i
was
up
in
a
moment
feeling
him
to
find
out
if
he
were
dead
my
hands
over
his
heart
dipped
into
a
pool
of
something
wet
and
warm
like
new
milk
i
wiped
them
on
his
sleeve
as
best
i
could
and
hastily
groped
about
for
his
sword
he
did
not
need
it
now
and
i
did
when
i
rose
with
it
my
quarry
was
swallowed
up
in
the
shadows
étienne
whose
light
clothing
made
a
distinguishable
spot
in
the
gloom
had
driven
his
opponent
or
his
opponent
had
driven
him
some
rods
up
the
lane
the
way
we
had
come
i
stood
perplexed
not
knowing
where
to
busy
myself
étienne
side
i
could
not
reach
past
the
two
duels
and
of
the
four
men
near
me
i
could
by
no
means
tell
as
they
circled
about
and
about
which
were
my
chosen
allies
they
were
all
sombrely
clad
their
faces
blurred
in
the
darkness
when
one
made
a
clever
pass
i
knew
not
whether
to
rejoice
or
despair
but
at
length
i
picked
out
one
who
fenced
though
valiantly
enough
yet
with
greater
effort
than
the
rest
and
i
deemed
that
this
had
been
the
hardest
pressed
of
all
and
must
certainly
be
one
of
the
attacked
and
the
one
most
deserving
of
succour
he
was
plainly
losing
ground
i
darted
to
his
side
just
as
his
foe
ran
him
through
the
arm
the
assailant
pulled
his
blade
free
and
darted
back
against
the
wall
to
face
the
two
of
us
but
the
sword
of
the
wounded
man
fell
from
his
loose
fingers
i
out
of
it
he
cried
to
me
i
go
for
aid
and
as
his
late
combatant
sprang
forward
to
engage
me
i
heard
him
running
off
stumbling
where
i
had
there
had
been
little
light
toward
the
last
in
the
court
of
the
house
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
and
less
under
the
windows
of
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
but
here
was
none
at
all
i
had
to
use
my
sword
solely
by
the
feel
of
his
against
it
and
i
underwent
chilling
qualms
lest
presently
without
in
the
least
knowing
how
it
got
there
i
should
find
his
point
sticking
out
of
my
back
i
could
hardly
believe
he
was
not
hitting
me
i
began
to
prickle
in
half
a
dozen
places
and
knew
not
whether
the
stings
were
real
or
imaginary
but
one
was
not
imaginary
my
shoulder
which
lucas
had
pinked
and
the
doctor
bandaged
was
throbbing
painfully
i
fancied
that
in
my
earlier
combat
the
wound
had
opened
again
and
that
i
was
bleeding
to
death
and
the
fear
shook
me
i
lunged
wildly
and
i
had
been
sent
to
my
account
in
short
order
had
not
at
this
moment
one
of
the
other
pair
near
us
as
it
afterward
appeared
driven
his
weapon
square
through
his
breast
i
am
done
for
run
who
can
he
cried
as
he
fell
the
sword
snapped
in
two
against
the
he
rolled
over
and
lay
still
his
face
in
the
dirt
my
encounterer
with
a
shout
to
his
single
remaining
comrade
made
off
down
the
lane
on
my
part
i
was
very
willing
to
let
him
depart
in
peace
the
clash
of
swords
up
the
lane
had
ceased
at
the
stricken
man
cry
and
out
of
the
gloom
came
the
sound
of
footfalls
fainter
and
fainter
i
deemed
that
the
battle
was
over
the
champion
came
toward
me
three
white
patches
visible
for
his
face
and
hands
the
rest
of
him
but
darkness
moving
in
darkness
he
held
a
sword
rifled
from
the
enemy
and
advanced
on
me
hesitatingly
not
sure
whether
friend
or
foe
remained
to
him
i
felt
that
an
explanation
was
due
from
me
but
in
my
ignorance
as
to
who
he
was
and
who
his
foes
were
and
why
they
had
been
fighting
him
and
why
we
had
been
fighting
them
i
stood
for
a
moment
confused
it
is
hard
to
open
conversation
with
a
shadow
he
spoke
first
in
a
voice
husky
from
his
exertion
who
are
you
a
friend
i
said
my
master
and
i
saw
two
men
fighting
four
we
came
to
help
the
weaker
side
your
friend
was
hurt
but
he
got
away
safe
to
fetch
aid
the
unknown
made
a
rapid
step
toward
me
crying
what
but
at
the
word
étienne
emerged
from
the
shadows
who
lives
he
called
out
you
félix
not
hurt
monsieur
and
you
not
a
scratch
nor
did
i
scratch
my
man
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
monsieur
on
our
coming
up
when
we
did
the
unknown
said
one
word
étienne
i
sprang
forward
with
the
impulse
to
throw
my
arms
about
him
in
the
pure
rapture
of
recognizing
his
voice
this
struggler
whom
we
had
rushed
in
blindfold
to
save
was
monsieur
if
we
had
been
content
to
mind
our
own
business
had
sheered
away
like
the
deputy
it
turned
me
faint
to
think
how
long
we
had
delayed
with
old
marceau
we
were
so
nearly
too
late
i
wanted
to
seize
monsieur
to
convince
myself
that
he
was
all
safe
to
feel
him
quick
and
warm
i
made
one
pace
and
stopped
for
i
remembered
what
ghastly
shape
stood
between
me
and
monsieur
that
horrible
lying
story
dieu
gasped
étienne
monsieur
for
a
moment
we
all
kept
silence
motionless
then
monsieur
flung
his
sword
over
the
wall
do
your
will
étienne
his
son
darted
forward
with
a
cry
monsieur
monsieur
i
am
not
your
assassin
i
came
to
your
aid
not
dreaming
who
you
were
but
had
i
known
i
would
have
fought
a
hundred
times
the
harder
i
never
plotted
against
you
on
the
honour
of
a
quentin
i
swear
it
monsieur
said
naught
and
we
could
not
see
his
face
could
not
know
whether
he
believed
or
rejected
softened
or
condemned
étienne
catching
at
his
breath
went
on
monsieur
i
know
it
is
hard
to
credit
i
have
been
a
bad
son
to
you
unloving
rebellious
insolent
we
quarrelled
i
spoke
bitter
words
but
i
am
no
ruffian
i
am
a
quentin
had
you
had
me
whipped
from
the
house
still
would
i
never
have
raised
hand
against
you
i
knew
nothing
of
the
plot
félix
told
you
i
was
in
it
small
blame
to
him
but
he
was
wrong
i
knew
naught
of
it
had
he
been
content
to
rest
his
case
here
i
think
monsieur
could
not
but
have
believed
his
innocence
on
his
bare
word
the
stones
in
the
pavement
must
have
known
that
he
was
uttering
truth
but
he
in
his
eagerness
paused
for
no
answer
but
went
on
to
stun
monsieur
with
statements
new
and
amazing
to
his
ear
my
cousin
grammont
who
is
dead
was
in
the
plot
and
his
lackey
pontou
and
martin
the
clerk
but
the
contriver
was
lucas
lucas
lucas
continued
étienne
or
to
give
him
his
true
title
paul
de
lorraine
son
of
henri
de
guise
but
that
is
impossible
monsieur
cried
stupefied
it
is
impossible
but
it
is
true
he
is
a
lorraine
mayenne
nephew
and
for
years
mayenne
spy
he
came
to
you
to
kill
you
for
that
object
pure
and
simple
last
spring
before
he
came
to
you
he
was
here
in
paris
with
mayenne
making
terms
for
your
murder
he
is
no
huguenot
no
kingsman
he
is
mayenne
henchman
son
to
guise
himself
and
how
long
have
you
known
this
asked
monsieur
since
this
morning
then
as
the
import
of
the
question
struck
him
he
fell
back
with
a
groan
ah
monsieur
if
you
can
ask
that
i
have
no
more
to
say
it
is
useless
he
turned
away
into
the
darkness
that
they
should
part
thus
was
too
miserable
to
be
endured
i
was
sure
monsieur
question
was
no
accusation
but
the
groping
of
bewilderment
étienne
stop
i
commanded
monsieur
it
is
the
truth
indeed
it
is
the
truth
he
is
innocent
and
lucas
a
guise
monsieur
you
must
listen
to
me
étienne
you
must
wait
i
stirred
up
the
whole
trouble
with
my
story
to
you
monsieur
and
i
take
it
back
i
believed
i
was
telling
the
truth
i
was
wrong
when
i
left
you
i
went
straight
back
to
the
rue
coupejarrets
to
kill
your
son
your
murderer
i
thought
and
there
i
found
grammont
and
lucas
side
by
side
we
thought
them
sworn
foes
they
were
hand
in
glove
they
came
at
me
to
end
me
because
i
had
told
and
étienne
saved
me
lucas
mocked
him
to
his
face
because
he
had
been
tricked
lucas
bragged
that
it
was
his
own
scheme
that
étienne
was
his
dupe
vigo
will
tell
you
vigo
heard
him
his
scheme
was
to
saddle
étienne
with
your
murder
he
was
tricked
he
believed
what
he
told
me
that
the
thing
was
a
duel
between
lucas
and
grammont
you
must
believe
it
monsieur
étienne
who
had
actually
obeyed
me
me
his
lackey
turned
to
his
father
once
again
monsieur
if
you
can
not
believe
me
believe
félix
you
believed
him
when
he
took
away
my
good
name
believe
him
now
when
he
restores
it
nay
monsieur
cried
i
believe
thee
étienne
and
he
took
his
son
in
his
arms
xxii
signet
of
the
already
a
wan
light
was
revealing
the
round
tops
of
the
in
de
mirabeau
garden
the
high
gray
wall
and
the
narrow
alleyway
beneath
it
and
the
two
vague
shapes
by
me
were
no
longer
vague
shapes
but
were
turning
moment
by
moment
as
if
coming
out
of
an
enchantment
into
their
true
forms
it
really
was
monsieur
in
the
flesh
with
a
wet
glint
in
his
eyes
as
he
kissed
his
boy
neither
thought
of
me
and
it
was
none
of
my
concern
what
they
said
to
each
other
i
went
a
rod
or
two
down
the
lane
round
a
curve
in
the
wall
and
watched
the
bands
of
light
streaking
the
eastern
sky
in
utter
content
never
before
had
the
world
seemed
to
me
so
good
a
place
since
this
misery
had
come
right
i
knew
all
the
rest
would
i
should
yet
dance
at
étienne
wedding
i
leaned
my
head
back
against
the
wall
and
had
shut
my
eyes
to
consider
the
matter
more
quietly
when
i
heard
my
name
félix
félix
where
is
the
boy
got
to
the
sun
was
clean
up
over
the
horizon
and
as
i
blinked
and
wondered
how
he
had
contrived
the
feat
so
quickly
my
two
messieurs
came
hand
in
hand
round
the
corner
to
me
the
level
rays
glittering
on
burnished
breastplate
on
étienne
bright
head
and
on
both
their
shining
faces
now
that
for
the
first
time
i
saw
them
together
i
found
them
despite
the
dark
hair
and
the
yellow
the
brown
eyes
and
the
gray
wonderfully
alike
there
was
the
same
carriage
the
same
cock
of
the
head
the
same
smile
if
i
had
not
known
before
i
knew
now
the
instant
i
looked
at
them
that
the
quarrel
was
over
save
as
it
gave
them
a
deeper
love
of
each
other
it
might
never
have
been
i
sprang
up
and
monsieur
my
duke
embraced
me
lucky
we
came
up
the
lane
when
we
did
eh
félix
étienne
said
but
monsieur
i
have
not
asked
you
yet
what
madness
sent
you
traversing
this
back
passage
at
two
in
the
morning
i
might
ask
you
that
étienne
the
young
man
hesitated
a
bare
moment
before
he
answered
i
am
just
come
from
serenading
mlle
de
montluc
a
shade
fell
over
monsieur
radiance
at
his
look
étienne
cried
out
i
told
you
i
no
leaguer
mayenne
offered
me
mademoiselle
if
i
would
come
over
i
refused
last
night
he
sent
me
word
that
he
would
kill
me
as
a
common
nuisance
if
i
sought
to
see
her
that
was
why
i
tried
monsieur
i
cried
curiosity
mastering
me
was
she
in
the
window
he
shook
his
head
his
eyes
on
his
father
face
étienne
monsieur
said
slowly
ca
you
see
that
mlle
de
montluc
is
not
for
you
i
shall
never
see
it
monsieur
the
first
article
in
my
creed
says
she
is
for
me
and
i
have
her
yet
for
all
mayenne
then
mordieu
we
steal
her
together
you
you
help
me
why
dear
son
monsieur
explained
it
broke
my
heart
to
think
of
you
in
the
league
i
could
not
bear
that
my
son
should
help
a
spaniard
to
the
throne
of
france
or
a
lorrainer
either
but
if
it
is
a
question
of
stealing
the
lady
well
i
never
prosed
about
prudence
yet
thank
god
étienne
laughing
hugged
monsieur
by
quentin
we
get
you
your
lady
i
hated
the
marriage
while
i
thought
it
would
make
you
a
leaguer
i
could
not
see
you
sacrifice
your
honour
to
a
girl
bright
eyes
but
your
life
that
is
different
my
life
is
a
little
thing
no
monsieur
said
it
is
a
good
deal
one
life
but
one
is
not
to
guard
one
life
at
the
cost
of
all
that
makes
life
sweet
ah
you
know
how
i
love
her
they
call
me
a
fool
monsieur
went
on
musingly
because
i
risk
my
life
in
wild
errands
but
mordieu
i
am
the
wise
man
for
they
who
think
ever
of
safety
and
crouch
and
scheme
and
shuffle
to
procure
it
why
look
you
they
destroy
their
own
ends
for
when
all
is
done
they
have
never
really
lived
and
that
is
why
they
hate
death
so
these
worthies
while
i
who
have
never
cringed
to
fear
i
live
like
a
king
i
go
my
ways
without
any
man
leave
and
if
death
comes
to
me
a
little
sooner
for
that
i
am
a
poor
creature
if
i
do
not
meet
him
smiling
if
i
may
live
as
i
please
i
am
content
to
die
when
i
must
aye
said
étienne
and
if
we
live
as
we
do
not
please
still
we
must
die
presently
therefore
do
i
purpose
never
to
give
over
striving
after
my
lady
oh
we
win
her
by
noon
but
first
we
sleep
there
félix
yawning
his
head
off
come
come
we
set
off
along
the
alley
the
quentins
arm
in
arm
i
at
their
heels
monsieur
looked
over
his
shoulder
with
a
sudden
anxiety
félix
you
said
huguet
had
run
for
aid
yes
monsieur
vigo
should
have
been
here
before
now
i
answered
remembering
vigo
promptitude
yesterday
every
one
was
asleep
he
has
been
hammering
this
to
get
in
étienne
said
easily
but
monsieur
asked
of
me
was
he
much
hurt
félix
no
i
am
sure
not
monsieur
he
was
run
through
the
arm
i
am
sure
he
was
not
hurt
otherwise
we
came
to
where
the
two
slain
men
lay
across
the
way
étienne
exclaimed
if
you
do
not
hold
your
life
dear
you
sell
it
dear
monsieur
how
many
of
the
rascals
were
there
it
was
hard
to
tell
in
the
dark
five
i
think
now
monsieur
how
came
you
to
be
in
this
place
in
the
dark
why
what
to
do
étienne
i
came
in
at
the
gate
just
after
midnight
i
could
not
leave
denis
earlier
and
night
is
my
time
to
enter
paris
the
inns
were
shut
but
some
friend
near
the
gate
tarigny
would
have
sheltered
you
aye
and
got
into
trouble
for
it
had
it
leaked
out
to
the
sixteen
tarigny
is
no
craven
but
neither
am
i
said
monsieur
smiling
oh
i
give
you
up
go
your
ways
but
i
will
not
come
to
save
you
next
time
no
lad
you
will
be
at
my
side
hereafter
étienne
laughed
and
said
no
more
but
in
truth
monsieur
added
i
did
not
expect
waylaying
if
these
fellows
watched
by
the
gate
they
hid
cleverly
i
never
saw
a
of
them
till
they
sprang
upon
us
by
the
corner
here
when
we
were
almost
home
étienne
bent
over
and
turned
face
up
the
man
whom
monsieur
had
run
through
the
heart
he
was
an
ugly
enough
fellow
one
eye
entirely
closed
by
a
great
scar
that
ran
from
his
forehead
nearly
to
his
grizzled
mustache
this
is
bernet
le
borgne
he
said
have
you
encountered
him
before
monsieur
he
was
a
soldier
under
guise
once
they
say
but
he
has
done
naught
but
hang
about
paris
taverns
this
many
a
year
we
used
to
wonder
how
he
lived
we
knew
he
did
somebody
dirty
work
clisson
employed
him
once
so
i
know
something
of
him
with
his
one
eye
he
could
fence
better
than
most
folks
with
two
my
congratulations
to
you
monsieur
but
monsieur
not
heeding
was
bending
over
the
other
man
your
acquaintance
is
wider
than
mine
do
you
know
this
one
étienne
shook
his
head
over
this
other
man
who
lay
face
up
staring
with
wide
dark
eyes
into
the
sky
his
hair
curled
in
little
rings
about
his
forehead
and
his
cheeks
were
smooth
he
looked
no
older
than
i
he
dashed
at
me
the
first
of
all
monsieur
said
in
a
low
voice
i
ran
him
through
before
the
others
came
up
mordieu
i
am
glad
it
was
dark
a
boy
like
that
he
had
good
mettle
to
run
up
first
étienne
said
and
it
is
no
disgrace
to
fall
to
your
sword
monsieur
come
let
us
go
but
monsieur
looked
back
again
at
the
dead
lad
and
then
at
his
son
and
at
me
and
came
with
us
heavy
of
countenance
on
the
stones
before
us
lay
a
trail
of
now
that
is
where
huguet
ran
with
his
wounded
arm
i
said
to
étienne
aye
and
if
we
did
not
know
the
way
home
we
could
find
it
by
this
red
track
but
the
trail
did
not
reach
the
door
for
when
we
turned
into
the
little
street
where
the
arch
is
where
i
had
waited
for
martin
as
we
turned
the
familiar
corner
under
the
walls
of
the
house
itself
we
came
suddenly
on
the
body
of
a
man
monsieur
ran
forward
with
a
cry
for
it
was
the
squire
huguet
he
wore
a
leather
jerkin
lined
with
steel
rings
mail
as
stout
as
any
forged
some
one
had
stabbed
once
and
again
at
the
coat
without
avail
and
had
then
torn
it
open
and
stabbed
his
defenceless
breast
though
we
had
killed
two
of
their
men
they
had
rained
blows
enough
on
this
man
of
ours
to
kill
twenty
monsieur
knelt
on
the
ground
beside
him
but
he
was
quite
cold
the
man
who
fled
when
we
charged
them
must
have
lurked
about
i
said
huguet
was
useless
he
could
not
defend
himself
or
else
he
fainted
from
his
wound
he
bled
so
étienne
answered
and
one
of
those
who
fled
last
came
upon
him
helpless
and
did
this
why
did
i
follow
him
instead
of
sitting
down
a
john
i
cried
but
i
was
thinking
of
you
and
monsieur
i
forgot
huguet
i
forgot
him
too
monsieur
sorrowed
shame
to
me
he
would
not
have
forgotten
me
monsieur
his
son
said
it
was
no
negligence
of
yours
you
could
have
saved
him
only
by
following
when
he
ran
and
that
was
impossible
in
sight
of
the
door
monsieur
said
sadly
in
sight
of
his
own
door
we
held
silent
monsieur
got
soberly
to
his
feet
i
never
lost
a
better
man
monsieur
i
cried
he
asks
no
better
epitaph
if
you
will
say
that
of
me
when
i
die
i
shall
not
have
lived
in
vain
he
smiled
at
the
outburst
but
i
did
not
care
if
he
would
only
smile
i
was
content
it
should
be
at
me
nay
félix
he
said
i
hope
it
will
not
be
i
who
compose
your
epitaph
come
we
must
get
to
the
house
and
send
after
poor
huguet
félix
and
i
will
carry
him
étienne
said
and
we
lifted
him
between
us
no
easy
task
for
he
was
a
heavy
fellow
but
it
was
little
enough
to
do
for
him
we
bore
him
along
slowly
monsieur
striding
ahead
but
of
a
sudden
he
turned
back
to
us
laying
quick
fingers
on
the
poor
torn
breast
what
is
it
monsieur
cried
his
son
my
papers
we
set
him
down
and
the
three
of
us
examined
him
from
top
to
toe
stripping
off
his
steel
coat
pulling
apart
his
linen
prying
into
his
very
boots
but
no
papers
revealed
themselves
what
were
they
monsieur
a
drawn
look
had
come
over
monsieur
face
papers
which
the
king
gave
me
and
which
i
fool
and
traitor
have
lost
i
ran
back
to
the
spot
where
we
had
found
huguet
there
was
his
hat
on
the
ground
but
no
papers
i
followed
up
the
red
trail
to
its
beginning
looking
behind
every
stone
every
bunch
of
grass
but
no
papers
in
my
desperation
i
even
pulled
about
the
dead
man
lest
the
packet
had
been
covered
falling
from
huguet
in
the
fray
the
two
gentlemen
joined
me
in
the
search
and
we
went
over
every
inch
of
the
ground
but
to
no
purpose
i
thought
them
safer
with
huguet
than
with
me
monsieur
groaned
i
knew
we
ran
the
risk
of
ambush
myself
would
be
the
object
of
attack
i
bade
huguet
were
we
waylaid
to
run
with
the
papers
and
of
course
he
would
not
he
should
it
was
my
command
he
stayed
and
saved
my
life
perhaps
and
lost
me
what
is
dearer
than
life
my
honour
he
could
not
leave
you
to
be
killed
monsieur
that
were
asking
the
impossible
aye
but
i
am
saved
at
the
ruin
of
a
hundred
others
monsieur
cried
the
papers
contained
certain
lists
of
names
of
mayenne
officers
pledged
to
support
the
king
if
he
turn
catholic
i
had
them
for
lemaître
but
at
this
date
in
mayenne
hands
they
spell
the
destruction
huguet
should
have
known
that
if
i
told
him
to
desert
me
i
meant
it
étienne
ventured
no
word
understanding
well
enough
that
in
such
bitter
moments
no
consolation
consoles
le
duc
added
after
a
moment
mordieu
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
i
might
be
better
occupied
than
in
blaming
the
dead
the
brave
and
faithful
dead
belike
he
could
not
run
they
set
on
us
so
suddenly
when
he
could
he
did
go
and
he
went
to
his
death
they
were
my
charge
the
papers
i
had
no
right
to
put
the
responsibility
on
any
other
i
should
have
kept
them
myself
i
should
have
gone
to
tarigny
i
should
never
have
ventured
myself
through
these
black
lanes
fool
traitorous
fool
nay
monsieur
the
mischance
might
have
befallen
any
one
it
would
not
have
befallen
villeroi
it
would
not
have
befallen
rosny
monsieur
exclaimed
bitterly
it
befalls
me
because
i
am
a
who
rushes
into
affairs
for
which
he
is
not
fit
i
can
handle
a
sword
but
i
have
no
business
to
meddle
in
statecraft
then
have
those
wiseheads
out
at
denis
no
business
to
employ
you
étienne
said
he
is
not
unknown
to
fame
this
duke
of
quentin
everybody
knows
how
he
goes
about
things
monsieur
they
gave
you
the
papers
because
no
one
else
would
carry
them
into
paris
they
knew
you
had
no
fear
in
you
and
it
is
because
of
that
that
the
papers
are
lacking
but
take
heart
monsieur
we
get
them
back
when
how
soon
étienne
answered
and
easily
if
you
will
tell
me
what
they
are
like
are
they
open
i
fear
by
now
they
may
be
there
are
three
sheets
of
names
and
a
fourth
sheet
a
letter
all
in
cipher
ah
but
in
that
case
monsieur
cut
short
his
son
jubilation
but
lucas
of
course
i
forgot
him
he
knows
your
ciphers
then
dolt
that
i
was
he
knows
everything
then
must
we
lay
hands
on
the
papers
before
they
reach
mayenne
and
all
is
saved
étienne
declared
cheerfully
these
fellows
ca
read
a
cipher
if
the
packet
be
not
open
monsieur
it
was
a
span
long
and
half
as
wide
for
all
address
the
letters
in
the
corner
it
was
tied
with
red
cord
and
bore
the
seal
of
a
flying
falcon
and
the
motto
what
the
king
seal
that
serious
expect
then
monsieur
to
see
the
papers
in
an
hour
time
étienne
étienne
monsieur
cried
are
you
mad
no
madder
than
is
proper
for
a
quentin
it
simple
enough
i
told
you
i
recognized
that
worthy
back
there
for
one
bernet
who
lodged
at
an
inn
i
wot
of
over
beyond
the
markets
do
we
betake
ourselves
thither
we
may
easily
fall
in
with
some
comrades
of
his
bosom
who
have
not
the
misfortune
to
be
lying
dead
in
a
back
lane
who
will
know
something
of
your
loss
bernet
sort
are
no
bigots
while
they
work
for
the
league
they
will
lend
a
kindly
ear
to
the
chink
of
kingsmen
florins
ah
cried
monsieur
then
let
us
go
but
étienne
laid
a
restraining
hand
on
his
shoulder
not
you
i
they
will
kill
you
in
the
halles
just
as
cheerfully
as
in
the
quartier
marais
this
is
my
affair
he
looked
at
monsieur
with
kindling
eyes
seeing
his
chance
to
prove
his
devotion
the
duke
yielded
to
his
eagerness
but
étienne
added
generously
you
may
have
the
honour
of
paying
the
piper
i
give
you
carte
blanche
my
son
étienne
if
you
put
that
packet
into
my
hand
it
is
more
than
if
you
brought
the
sceptre
of
france
then
go
practise
monsieur
at
feeling
more
than
king
he
embraced
his
father
and
we
turned
off
down
the
street
the
sun
was
well
up
by
this
time
and
the
city
rousing
to
the
labours
of
the
day
half
was
i
glad
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
for
we
ran
no
risk
now
of
cutthroats
and
half
was
i
sorry
for
it
behooves
not
a
man
supposed
to
be
in
the
bastille
to
show
himself
too
liberally
to
the
broad
eye
of
the
streets
every
time
and
it
was
often
that
we
approached
a
person
who
to
my
nervous
imagination
looked
official
i
shook
in
my
shoes
the
way
seemed
fairly
to
bristle
with
soldiers
officers
judges
for
aught
i
knew
members
of
the
sixteen
governor
belin
himself
it
was
a
great
surprise
to
me
when
at
length
we
arrived
without
let
or
hindrance
before
the
door
of
a
mean
little
our
goal
we
went
in
and
étienne
ordered
wine
much
to
my
satisfaction
my
stomach
was
beginning
to
remind
me
that
i
had
given
it
nothing
for
twelve
hours
or
so
while
i
had
worked
my
legs
hard
does
bernet
lodge
with
you
my
master
asked
of
the
landlord
we
were
his
only
patrons
at
the
moment
bernet
him
with
the
eye
out
the
same
why
no
monsieur
i
do
let
lodgings
the
building
is
not
mine
i
but
rent
the
ground
floor
for
my
purposes
but
bernet
lodges
in
the
house
then
no
he
does
he
lodges
round
the
corner
in
the
court
off
the
rue
clichet
but
he
comes
here
often
oh
aye
every
morning
for
his
glass
and
most
evenings
too
étienne
laid
down
the
and
something
more
sometimes
he
has
a
friend
with
him
eh
the
man
laughed
no
monsieur
he
comes
in
here
alone
many
the
time
i
standing
in
my
door
when
he
go
by
with
some
gallant
and
he
never
chances
to
see
me
or
my
shop
while
if
he
alone
it
morning
jean
anything
in
the
casks
he
can
no
more
get
by
my
door
than
he
get
by
death
when
the
time
comes
no
agreed
étienne
we
all
stop
there
soon
or
late
those
friends
of
bernet
then
there
is
none
you
could
put
a
name
to
why
no
monsieur
more
the
pity
he
has
none
lives
in
this
quarter
bernet
in
low
water
you
understand
monsieur
if
he
lives
here
it
is
because
he
ca
help
it
but
he
goes
elsewhere
for
his
friends
then
you
can
tell
us
my
man
where
he
lodges
aye
that
can
i
mine
host
answered
bustling
out
from
behind
the
bar
eager
in
the
interest
of
the
gallant
just
round
the
corner
of
the
rue
clichet
in
the
court
the
first
house
on
the
left
that
is
his
i
would
go
with
monsieur
only
i
can
not
leave
the
shop
alone
and
the
wife
not
back
from
market
but
monsieur
can
not
miss
it
the
first
house
in
the
court
thank
you
monsieur
au
revoir
monsieur
in
the
doorway
of
the
first
house
on
the
left
in
the
little
court
stood
an
old
man
with
a
wooden
leg
sweeping
heaps
of
refuse
out
of
the
passage
it
appears
that
every
one
on
this
stair
lacks
something
étienne
murmured
to
me
it
is
the
livery
of
the
house
can
you
tell
me
friend
where
i
may
find
m
bernet
the
concierge
regarded
us
without
cordiality
while
by
no
means
ceasing
his
endeavours
to
cover
our
shoes
with
his
sweepings
third
story
back
he
said
does
bernet
lodge
alone
one
of
him
enough
the
old
fellow
growled
whacking
out
his
dirty
broom
on
the
powdering
us
with
dust
étienne
coughing
pursued
his
inquiries
ah
i
understood
he
shared
his
lodgings
with
a
comrade
he
has
a
friend
then
in
the
building
aye
i
suppose
so
the
old
chap
grinned
when
monsieur
walks
in
but
he
has
another
friend
besides
me
has
he
not
étienne
persisted
one
who
if
he
does
not
live
here
comes
often
to
see
m
bernet
you
seem
to
know
all
about
it
better
see
bernet
himself
instead
of
chattering
here
all
day
good
advice
and
i
take
it
said
étienne
lightly
setting
foot
on
the
stair
muttering
to
himself
as
he
mounted
and
come
back
to
break
your
head
mon
vieillard
we
went
up
the
three
flights
and
along
the
passage
to
the
door
at
the
back
whereon
étienne
pounded
loudly
i
could
not
see
his
reason
and
heartily
i
wished
he
would
not
it
seemed
to
me
a
creepy
thing
to
be
knocking
on
a
man
door
when
we
knew
very
well
he
would
never
open
it
again
we
knocked
as
if
we
fully
thought
him
within
when
all
the
while
we
knew
he
was
lying
a
stone
on
the
stones
under
de
mirabeau
garden
wall
perhaps
by
this
time
he
had
been
found
perhaps
one
of
the
marquis
liveried
lackeys
or
a
passing
idler
or
a
woman
with
a
had
come
upon
him
perhaps
even
now
he
was
being
borne
away
on
a
plank
to
be
identified
and
here
were
we
knocking
knocking
as
if
we
innocently
expected
him
to
open
to
us
i
had
a
chill
dread
that
suddenly
he
would
open
to
us
the
door
would
swing
wide
and
show
him
pale
and
bloody
with
the
broken
sword
in
his
heart
at
the
real
creaking
of
a
hinge
i
could
scarce
swallow
a
cry
it
was
not
bernet
door
but
the
door
at
the
front
which
opened
letting
a
stream
of
sunlight
into
the
dark
passage
in
the
doorway
stood
a
woman
with
two
babies
clinging
to
her
skirts
madame
étienne
addressed
her
with
the
courtesy
due
to
a
duchess
i
have
been
knocking
at
bernet
door
without
result
perhaps
you
could
give
me
some
hint
as
to
his
whereabouts
ah
i
am
sorry
i
know
nothing
to
tell
monsieur
she
cried
regretfully
impressed
as
the
concierge
had
not
been
by
his
look
and
manner
but
this
i
can
say
he
went
out
last
night
and
i
do
not
believe
he
has
been
in
since
he
went
out
about
nine
or
it
may
have
been
later
than
that
because
i
did
not
put
the
children
to
bed
till
after
dark
they
enjoy
running
about
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
as
much
as
anybody
else
the
little
dears
and
they
were
cross
last
night
the
day
was
so
hot
and
i
was
a
long
time
hushing
them
to
sleep
yes
it
must
have
been
after
ten
because
they
were
asleep
and
the
man
stumbling
on
the
stairs
woke
pierre
and
he
cried
for
an
hour
you
my
angel
she
picked
one
of
the
brats
up
in
her
arms
to
display
him
to
us
étienne
asked
what
man
why
the
one
that
came
for
him
the
one
he
went
out
with
and
what
sort
of
person
was
this
nay
how
was
i
to
see
would
i
be
out
walking
the
common
passage
with
a
child
to
hush
i
was
rocking
the
cradle
but
who
does
come
here
to
visit
m
bernet
i
never
seen
any
one
monsieur
i
never
laid
eyes
on
bernet
but
twice
i
keep
in
my
apartment
and
besides
we
have
only
been
here
a
week
i
thank
you
madame
étienne
said
turning
to
the
stairs
she
ran
out
to
the
rail
babies
and
all
but
i
could
take
a
message
for
him
monsieur
i
will
make
a
point
of
seeing
him
when
he
comes
in
i
will
not
burden
you
madame
étienne
answered
from
the
story
below
but
she
was
loath
to
stop
talking
and
hung
over
the
railing
to
call
beware
of
your
footing
monsieur
those
people
are
not
so
tidy
as
they
might
be
one
stumbles
over
all
sorts
of
their
rubbish
out
in
the
public
way
the
door
in
front
of
us
opened
with
a
startling
suddenness
and
a
big
brawny
wench
bounced
out
to
demand
of
us
what
is
that
she
says
what
are
you
saying
of
us
you
slut
we
had
no
mind
to
be
mixed
in
the
quarrel
we
fled
for
our
lives
down
the
stair
the
old
carl
though
his
sweeping
was
done
leaned
on
his
broom
on
the
outer
step
so
you
did
find
bernet
at
home
i
could
have
told
you
as
much
had
you
been
civil
enough
to
ask
i
would
have
kicked
the
old
curmudgeon
but
étienne
drew
two
gold
pieces
from
his
pouch
perchance
if
i
ask
you
civilly
you
will
tell
me
with
whom
bernet
went
out
last
night
who
says
he
went
out
with
anybody
i
do
and
étienne
made
a
motion
to
return
the
coins
to
their
place
since
you
know
so
much
it
strange
you
do
know
a
little
more
the
old
chap
growled
well
lord
knows
if
it
is
really
his
but
he
goes
by
the
name
of
peyrot
and
where
does
he
lodge
how
should
i
know
i
have
trouble
enough
keeping
track
of
my
own
lodgers
without
bothering
my
head
about
other
people
now
rack
your
brains
my
friend
over
this
fellow
étienne
said
patiently
with
a
persuasive
chink
of
his
pouch
recollect
now
you
have
been
sent
to
this
monsieur
with
a
message
well
rue
des
tournelles
sign
of
the
gilded
shears
the
old
carl
spat
out
at
last
you
are
sure
hang
me
else
if
you
are
lying
to
me
i
will
come
back
and
beat
you
to
a
jelly
with
your
own
broom
it
the
truth
monsieur
he
said
with
some
proper
show
of
respect
at
last
peyrot
at
the
gilded
shears
rue
des
tournelles
you
may
beat
me
to
a
jelly
if
i
lie
it
would
do
you
good
in
any
event
étienne
told
him
but
flinging
him
his
pistoles
nevertheless
the
old
fellow
swooped
upon
them
gathered
them
up
and
was
behind
the
closed
door
all
in
one
movement
but
as
we
walked
away
he
opened
a
little
wicket
in
the
upper
panel
and
stuck
out
his
ugly
head
to
yell
after
us
if
bernet
not
at
home
yet
neither
will
his
friend
be
i
told
you
what
will
profit
you
none
you
mistake
sir
gargoyle
étienne
called
over
his
shoulder
your
information
is
entirely
to
my
needs
xxiii
chevalier
of
the
it
was
a
long
walk
to
the
rue
des
tournelles
which
lay
in
our
own
quarter
not
a
dozen
streets
from
the
hôtel
quentin
itself
we
found
the
gilded
shears
hung
before
a
tailor
shop
in
the
cellar
of
a
tall
cramped
structure
only
one
window
wide
its
narrow
door
was
inhospitably
shut
but
at
our
summons
the
concierge
appeared
to
inform
us
that
peyrot
did
truly
live
here
and
moreover
was
at
home
having
arrived
but
half
an
hour
earlier
than
we
he
would
go
up
and
find
out
whether
monsieur
could
see
us
but
étienne
thought
that
formality
unnecessary
and
was
able
at
small
expense
to
convince
the
concierge
of
it
we
went
alone
up
the
stairs
and
crept
very
quietly
along
the
passage
toward
the
door
of
peyrot
but
our
shoes
made
some
noise
on
the
flags
had
he
been
listening
he
might
have
heard
us
as
easily
as
we
heard
him
peyrot
had
not
yet
gone
to
bed
after
the
night
exertion
a
certain
clatter
and
gurgle
convinced
us
that
he
was
refreshing
himself
with
supper
or
breakfast
before
reposing
étienne
stood
still
his
hand
on
the
eager
hesitating
here
was
the
man
were
the
papers
here
if
they
were
should
we
secure
them
a
single
false
step
a
single
wrong
word
might
foil
us
the
sound
of
a
chair
pushed
back
came
from
within
and
a
young
quick
firm
step
passed
across
to
the
far
side
of
the
room
we
heard
a
box
shut
and
locked
étienne
nipped
my
arm
we
thought
we
knew
what
went
in
then
came
steps
again
and
a
loud
yawn
and
presently
two
whacks
on
the
floor
we
knew
as
well
as
if
we
could
see
that
peyrot
had
thrown
his
boots
across
the
room
next
a
clash
and
jangle
of
metal
that
meant
his
with
its
accoutrements
flung
on
the
table
étienne
with
the
rapid
murmur
if
i
look
at
you
nab
him
turned
the
but
peyrot
had
prepared
against
surprise
by
the
simple
expedient
of
locking
his
door
he
heard
us
too
for
he
stopped
in
the
very
middle
of
a
prolonged
yawn
and
held
himself
absolutely
still
étienne
called
out
softly
peyrot
who
is
it
i
want
to
speak
with
you
about
something
important
who
are
you
then
i
tell
you
when
you
let
me
in
i
let
you
in
when
you
tell
me
my
name
martin
i
a
friend
of
bernet
i
want
to
speak
to
you
quietly
about
a
matter
of
importance
a
friend
of
bernet
hmm
well
friend
of
bernet
it
appears
to
me
you
speak
very
well
through
the
door
i
want
to
speak
with
you
about
the
affair
of
what
affair
affair
i
go
to
a
at
germain
what
have
you
to
say
about
that
last
night
then
étienne
amended
with
rising
temper
if
you
want
me
to
shout
it
out
on
your
stairs
the
quentin
affair
now
what
may
you
mean
by
that
called
the
voice
from
within
if
peyrot
was
startled
by
the
name
he
carried
it
off
well
you
know
what
i
mean
shall
i
take
the
house
into
our
confidence
the
house
knows
as
much
of
your
meaning
as
i
see
here
friend
of
bernet
if
you
are
that
gentleman
mate
perhaps
you
have
a
password
about
you
aye
said
étienne
readily
this
is
it
twenty
pistoles
no
answer
came
immediately
i
could
guess
peyrot
puzzled
presently
he
called
to
us
by
the
bones
of
anne
i
do
believe
a
word
you
been
saying
but
i
have
you
in
and
see
what
you
look
like
we
heard
him
getting
into
his
boots
again
and
buckling
on
his
baldric
then
we
listened
to
the
turning
of
a
key
a
lid
was
raised
and
banged
down
again
and
the
lock
refastened
it
was
the
box
once
more
étienne
and
i
looked
at
each
other
at
length
peyrot
opened
the
door
and
surveyed
us
what
two
friends
of
bernet
ventre
bleu
but
he
allowed
us
to
enter
he
drew
back
before
us
with
a
flourishing
bow
his
hand
resting
lightly
on
his
belt
in
which
was
stuck
a
brace
of
pistols
any
idea
of
doing
violence
on
the
person
of
peyrot
we
dismissed
for
the
present
our
eyes
travelled
from
his
pistols
over
the
rest
of
him
he
was
small
lean
and
wiry
with
dark
sharp
face
and
twinkling
eyes
one
moment
glance
gave
us
to
know
that
peyrot
was
no
fool
my
lord
closed
the
door
after
him
and
went
straight
to
the
point
peyrot
you
were
engaged
last
night
in
an
attack
on
the
duke
of
quentin
you
did
not
succeed
in
slaying
him
but
you
did
kill
his
man
and
you
took
from
him
a
packet
i
come
to
buy
it
he
looked
at
us
a
little
dazed
not
understanding
i
deem
how
we
knew
this
certes
it
had
been
too
dark
in
the
lane
for
his
face
to
be
seen
and
he
had
doubtless
made
sure
that
he
was
not
followed
home
he
said
directly
you
are
the
comte
de
mar
even
so
peyrot
i
did
not
care
to
have
the
whole
stair
know
it
but
to
you
i
have
no
hesitation
in
confiding
that
i
am
de
mar
peyrot
swept
a
bow
till
his
head
almost
touched
the
floor
my
poor
apartment
is
honoured
as
he
louted
low
i
made
a
spring
forward
i
thought
to
pin
him
before
he
could
rise
but
he
was
up
with
the
lightness
of
a
bird
from
the
bough
and
standing
three
yards
away
from
me
where
i
crouched
on
the
spring
like
a
foiled
cat
he
grinned
at
me
in
open
enjoyment
monsieur
desired
he
asked
sympathetically
no
it
is
i
who
desire
said
étienne
clearing
himself
a
place
to
sit
on
the
corner
of
the
table
i
desire
that
packet
monsieur
you
know
this
little
expedition
of
yours
was
something
of
a
failure
when
you
report
to
the
he
will
not
be
in
the
best
of
humours
he
does
not
like
failures
the
general
he
will
not
incline
to
reward
you
dear
while
i
am
in
the
very
best
humour
in
the
world
he
smiled
to
prove
it
nor
do
i
think
his
complaisance
altogether
feigned
the
temper
of
our
host
amused
him
as
for
friend
peyrot
he
still
looked
dazed
i
thought
it
was
because
he
had
not
yet
made
up
his
mind
what
line
to
take
but
had
i
viewed
him
with
neutral
eyes
i
might
easily
have
deemed
his
bewilderment
genuine
perhaps
we
should
get
on
better
if
i
could
understand
what
monsieur
is
driving
at
he
suggested
monsieur
remarks
about
his
noble
father
and
the
are
interesting
but
humble
jean
peyrot
who
does
not
move
in
court
circles
is
at
a
loss
to
translate
them
in
other
words
i
have
no
notion
what
you
are
talking
about
oh
come
étienne
cried
no
shuffling
peyrot
we
know
as
well
as
you
where
you
were
before
dawn
before
dawn
marry
i
was
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
virtuous
étienne
slipped
across
the
room
as
quickly
as
peyrot
self
might
have
done
lifted
up
a
heavy
curtain
hanging
before
an
alcove
and
disclosed
the
bed
folded
smooth
the
pillow
undisturbed
he
turned
with
a
triumphant
grin
on
the
owner
who
showed
all
his
teeth
pleasantly
in
answer
no
whit
abashed
for
all
you
are
a
count
monsieur
you
have
the
worst
manners
ever
came
inside
these
walls
le
comte
with
no
attempt
at
mending
them
went
on
a
tour
about
the
room
examining
with
sniffing
interest
all
its
furniture
even
to
the
dishes
and
tankards
on
the
table
peyrot
leaning
against
the
wall
by
the
window
regarded
him
steadily
with
impassive
face
at
length
étienne
walked
over
to
the
chest
by
the
chimneypiece
and
deliberately
put
his
hand
on
the
key
instantly
peyrot
voice
rang
out
stop
étienne
turning
looked
into
his
my
lord
stood
exactly
as
he
was
bent
over
the
chest
his
fingers
on
the
key
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
bravo
with
raised
protesting
eyebrows
and
laughing
mouth
but
though
he
laughed
he
stood
still
if
you
make
a
movement
i
do
not
like
de
mar
i
will
shoot
you
as
i
would
a
rat
your
side
is
down
and
mine
is
up
i
have
no
fear
to
kill
you
it
will
be
painful
to
me
but
if
necessary
i
shall
do
it
étienne
sat
down
on
the
chest
and
smiled
more
amiably
than
ever
why
have
i
never
known
you
before
peyrot
one
moment
monsieur
the
nose
of
the
pistol
pointed
around
to
me
go
over
there
to
the
door
you
i
retreated
covered
by
the
shining
muzzle
to
a
spot
that
pleased
him
now
are
we
more
comfortable
peyrot
observed
pulling
a
chair
over
against
the
wall
and
seating
him
the
pistol
on
his
knee
monsieur
was
saying
monsieur
crossed
his
legs
as
if
of
all
seats
in
the
world
he
liked
his
present
one
the
best
he
had
brought
none
of
the
airs
of
the
noble
into
this
business
realizing
shrewdly
that
they
would
but
hamper
him
as
lace
ruffles
hamper
a
duellist
peyrot
treeless
adventurer
living
by
his
sharp
sword
and
sharp
wits
reverenced
a
count
no
more
than
a
his
occasional
mocking
deference
was
more
insulting
than
outright
rudeness
but
étienne
bore
it
unruffled
possibly
he
schooled
himself
so
to
bear
it
but
i
think
rather
that
he
felt
so
easily
secure
on
the
height
of
his
gentlehood
that
peyrot
impudence
merely
tickled
him
i
was
wondering
he
answered
pleasantly
how
long
you
have
dwelt
in
this
town
and
i
not
known
it
you
are
from
guienne
methinks
carcassonne
way
the
other
said
indifferently
then
memory
bringing
a
deep
twinkle
to
his
eye
he
added
what
think
you
monsieur
i
was
left
a
babe
on
the
monastery
step
was
reared
up
in
holiness
within
its
sacred
walls
chorister
at
ten
novice
at
eighteen
friar
fasting
praying
and
singing
misereres
exhorting
dying
saints
and
living
sinners
at
twenty
a
very
pretty
brotherhood
you
for
sample
nay
i
am
none
else
i
might
have
stayed
but
one
night
i
took
lived
in
the
woods
till
my
hair
grew
and
struck
out
for
paris
and
never
regretted
it
neither
he
leaned
his
head
back
his
eyes
fixed
contemplatively
on
the
ceiling
and
burst
into
song
in
voice
as
melodious
as
a
lark
and
grace
and
gloom
for
such
like
guests
i
have
no
room
piety
and
gloom
and
grace
i
bang
my
door
shut
in
your
face
gloom
and
grace
and
piety
i
set
my
dog
on
such
as
ye
finishing
his
stave
he
continued
to
beat
time
with
his
heel
on
the
floor
and
to
gaze
upon
the
ceiling
but
i
think
we
could
not
have
twitched
a
finger
without
his
noting
it
étienne
rose
and
leaned
across
the
table
toward
him
peyrot
has
made
his
fortune
in
paris
monsieur
rolls
in
wealth
of
course
peyrot
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
eyes
leaving
the
ceiling
and
making
a
mocking
pilgrimage
of
the
room
resting
finally
on
his
own
rusty
clothing
do
i
look
it
he
answered
oh
said
étienne
slowly
as
one
who
digests
an
entirely
new
idea
i
supposed
monsieur
must
be
as
rich
as
a
lombard
he
is
so
cold
on
the
subject
of
turning
an
honest
penny
peyrot
roving
eye
condescended
to
meet
his
visitor
say
on
he
permitted
lazily
i
offer
twenty
pistoles
for
a
packet
seal
unbroken
taken
at
dawn
from
the
person
of
de
quentin
squire
now
you
are
talking
sensibly
the
scamp
said
as
if
étienne
had
been
the
shuffler
that
is
a
fair
offer
and
demands
a
fair
answer
moreover
such
zeal
as
you
display
deserves
success
i
will
look
about
a
bit
this
morning
among
my
friends
and
see
if
i
can
get
wind
of
your
packet
i
will
meet
you
at
at
the
inn
of
the
bonne
femme
is
far
hence
you
forget
peyrot
that
you
are
risen
earlier
than
usual
i
will
go
out
and
sit
on
the
stair
for
five
minutes
while
you
consult
your
friends
peyrot
grinned
cheerfully
de
mar
does
seem
able
to
get
it
through
his
head
that
i
know
nothing
whatever
of
this
affair
no
i
certainly
do
get
that
through
my
head
peyrot
regarded
him
with
an
air
yet
compassionate
such
as
he
might
in
his
monkish
days
have
employed
toward
one
who
could
not
be
convinced
for
instance
of
the
efficacy
of
prayer
de
mar
quoth
he
plaintively
in
pity
half
for
himself
so
misunderstood
half
for
his
interlocutor
so
wilfully
blind
i
do
solemnly
assure
you
once
and
for
all
that
i
know
nothing
of
this
affair
of
yours
till
you
so
asserted
i
had
no
knowledge
that
monsieur
your
honoured
father
had
been
set
on
and
deeply
am
i
pained
to
hear
it
these
be
evil
days
when
such
things
can
happen
as
for
your
packet
i
learn
of
it
only
through
your
word
having
no
more
to
do
with
this
deplorable
business
than
a
babe
unborn
i
declare
i
was
almost
shaken
almost
thought
we
had
wronged
him
but
étienne
gauged
him
otherwise
your
words
please
me
he
began
the
contemplation
of
virtue
the
rascal
droned
with
lips
in
pulpit
tone
is
always
uplifting
to
the
spirit
you
have
boasted
étienne
went
on
that
your
side
was
up
and
mine
down
did
you
not
reflect
that
soon
my
side
may
be
up
and
yours
down
you
would
hardly
be
at
such
pains
to
deny
that
you
ever
bared
blade
against
the
duke
of
st
quentin
i
have
made
my
declaration
in
the
presence
of
two
witnesses
far
too
honourable
to
falsify
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
attack
on
the
duke
peyrot
repeated
with
apparent
satisfaction
but
of
course
it
is
possible
that
by
scouring
paris
i
might
get
on
the
scent
of
your
packet
twenty
pistoles
though
that
is
not
much
étienne
stood
silent
drumming
tattoos
on
the
table
not
pleased
with
the
turn
of
the
matter
not
seeing
how
to
better
it
had
we
been
sure
of
our
suspicions
we
would
have
charged
him
pistol
or
no
pistol
trusting
that
our
quickness
would
prevent
his
shooting
or
that
the
powder
would
miss
fire
or
that
the
ball
would
fly
wide
or
that
we
should
be
hit
in
no
vital
part
trusting
in
short
that
god
was
with
us
and
would
in
some
fashion
save
us
but
we
could
not
be
sure
that
the
packet
was
with
peyrot
what
we
had
heard
him
lock
in
the
chest
might
have
been
these
very
pistols
that
he
had
afterward
taken
out
again
three
men
had
fled
from
de
mirabeau
alley
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
whether
this
peyrot
were
he
who
ran
as
we
came
up
he
whom
i
had
encountered
or
he
who
had
engaged
étienne
and
did
we
know
that
would
not
tell
us
which
of
the
three
had
stabbed
and
plundered
huguet
peyrot
might
have
the
packet
or
he
might
know
who
had
it
or
he
might
be
in
honest
ignorance
of
its
existence
if
he
had
it
it
were
a
crying
shame
to
pay
out
honest
money
for
what
we
might
take
by
force
to
buy
your
own
goods
from
a
thief
were
a
sin
but
supposing
he
had
it
not
if
we
could
seize
upon
him
disarm
him
bind
him
threaten
him
beat
him
rack
him
would
he
granted
he
knew
reveal
its
whereabouts
writ
large
in
his
face
was
every
manner
of
roguery
but
not
one
iota
of
cowardice
he
might
very
well
hold
us
baffled
hour
on
hour
while
the
papers
went
to
mayenne
even
should
he
tell
we
had
the
business
to
begin
again
from
the
very
beginning
with
some
other
knave
mayhap
worse
than
this
plainly
the
game
was
in
peyrot
hands
we
could
play
only
to
his
lead
if
you
will
put
the
packet
into
my
hands
seal
unbroken
this
day
at
eleven
i
engage
to
meet
you
with
twenty
pistoles
étienne
said
twenty
pistoles
were
a
fair
price
for
the
packet
but
monsieur
forgets
the
wear
and
tear
on
my
conscience
incurred
for
him
i
must
be
reimbursed
for
that
conscience
quotha
certainly
monsieur
i
am
in
my
way
as
honest
a
man
as
you
in
yours
i
have
never
been
false
to
the
hand
that
fed
me
if
therefore
i
divert
to
you
a
certain
packet
which
of
rights
goes
elsewhere
my
sin
must
be
made
worth
my
while
my
conscience
will
sting
me
sorely
but
with
the
aid
of
a
glass
and
a
lass
i
may
contrive
to
forget
the
pain
my
love
and
folly
dear
baggages
you
welcome
here
i
fix
the
injury
to
my
conscience
at
thirty
pistoles
le
comte
fifty
in
all
will
bring
the
packet
to
your
hand
it
had
been
a
pleasure
to
le
comte
to
fling
a
tankard
in
the
face
but
the
steadfast
determination
to
win
the
papers
for
monsieur
and
possibly
respect
for
peyrot
weapon
withheld
him
very
well
then
in
the
cabaret
of
the
bonne
femme
at
eleven
you
may
do
as
you
like
about
appearing
i
shall
be
there
with
my
fifty
pistoles
what
guaranty
have
i
that
you
will
deal
fairly
with
me
the
word
of
a
st
quentin
sufficient
of
course
the
scamp
rose
with
a
bow
well
i
have
not
the
word
of
a
gentleman
to
offer
you
but
i
give
you
the
opinion
of
jean
peyrot
sometime
father
ambrosius
that
he
and
the
packet
will
be
there
this
has
been
a
delightful
call
monsieur
and
i
am
loath
to
let
you
go
but
it
is
time
i
was
free
to
look
for
that
packet
étienne
eyes
went
over
to
the
chest
i
wish
you
all
success
in
your
arduous
search
it
is
like
to
be
in
truth
a
long
and
weary
search
peyrot
sighed
my
ignorance
of
the
perpetrators
of
the
outrage
makes
my
task
difficult
indeed
but
rest
assured
monsieur
that
i
shall
question
every
man
in
paris
if
need
be
i
shall
leave
no
stone
unturned
étienne
still
pensively
regarded
the
chest
if
you
leave
no
key
unturned
be
more
to
the
purpose
you
appear
yet
to
nurse
the
belief
that
i
have
the
packet
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
monsieur
i
have
not
i
studied
his
grave
face
and
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
make
out
whether
he
were
lying
étienne
said
merely
come
félix
you
drink
a
glass
before
you
go
peyrot
cried
hospitably
running
to
fill
a
goblet
muddy
with
his
last
pouring
but
étienne
drew
back
well
i
do
blame
you
i
would
drink
it
myself
if
i
were
a
count
peyrot
said
setting
the
draught
to
his
own
lips
after
this
noon
i
shall
drink
it
no
more
all
summer
i
shall
live
like
a
king
me
folly
hug
me
mirth
life
without
you
nothing
worth
monsieur
can
i
lend
you
a
hat
i
had
already
opened
the
door
and
was
holding
it
for
my
master
to
pass
when
peyrot
picked
up
from
the
floor
and
held
out
to
him
a
battered
and
dirty
toque
with
its
draggled
feather
hanging
forlornly
over
the
side
chafed
as
he
was
étienne
could
not
deny
a
laugh
to
the
impudence
i
can
not
rob
monsieur
he
said
le
comte
need
have
no
scruple
i
shall
buy
me
better
out
of
his
fifty
pistoles
but
étienne
was
out
in
the
passage
i
following
banging
the
door
after
me
we
went
down
the
stair
in
time
to
peyrot
lusty
carolling
i
keep
though
riches
fly
while
folly
sure
to
linger
by
think
you
we
get
the
packet
i
asked
aye
i
think
he
wants
his
fifty
pistoles
mordieu
it
galling
to
let
this
dog
set
the
terms
monsieur
i
cried
perhaps
he
not
stir
out
at
once
i
run
home
for
vigo
and
his
men
and
we
make
the
rascal
disgorge
now
are
you
more
zealous
than
honest
boy
i
was
silent
abashed
and
he
added
i
had
not
been
afraid
to
try
conclusions
with
him
pistols
or
not
were
i
sure
that
he
had
the
packet
i
believe
he
has
yet
there
is
the
chance
that
after
all
in
this
one
particular
he
speaks
truth
i
can
not
take
any
chances
i
must
get
those
papers
for
monsieur
yes
we
could
not
have
done
otherwise
étienne
but
monsieur
will
you
dare
go
to
this
inn
le
comte
is
a
man
in
jeopardy
he
may
not
keep
rendezvous
of
the
enemy
choosing
i
might
not
keep
one
of
lucas
choosing
though
he
added
with
a
smile
natheless
i
think
i
should
but
it
is
not
likely
this
fellow
knows
of
the
warrant
against
me
paris
is
a
big
place
news
does
not
travel
all
over
town
as
quickly
as
at
quentin
i
think
friend
peyrot
has
more
to
gain
by
playing
fair
than
playing
false
and
appointing
the
cabaret
of
the
bonne
femme
has
a
very
open
pleasing
sound
did
he
mean
to
brain
me
he
would
scarce
have
set
that
place
it
was
not
peyrot
alone
i
meant
but
monsieur
is
so
well
known
in
the
streets
or
at
the
some
one
may
see
you
who
knows
mayenne
is
after
you
oh
of
that
i
must
take
my
chance
he
made
answer
no
whit
troubled
by
the
warning
i
go
home
now
for
the
ransom
and
i
will
be
at
the
pains
to
doff
this
gear
for
something
darker
monsieur
i
pleaded
why
not
stay
at
home
to
get
your
dues
of
sleep
vigo
will
bring
the
gold
he
and
i
will
put
the
matter
through
i
ask
not
your
advice
he
cried
haughtily
then
with
instant
softening
nay
this
is
my
affair
félix
i
have
taken
it
upon
myself
to
recover
monsieur
his
papers
i
must
carry
it
through
myself
to
the
very
omega
i
said
no
more
partly
because
it
would
have
done
no
good
partly
because
in
spite
of
the
strange
word
i
understood
how
he
felt
perhaps
you
should
go
home
and
sleep
he
suggested
tenderly
nay
cried
i
i
had
a
in
the
lane
i
game
to
see
it
through
then
he
commanded
you
may
stay
and
watch
that
door
for
i
have
some
curiosity
to
know
whether
he
will
need
to
fare
forth
after
the
treasure
if
he
do
as
i
guess
he
will
spend
the
next
hours
as
you
counsel
me
making
up
arrears
of
sleep
and
you
not
see
him
till
a
quarter
or
so
before
eleven
but
whenever
he
comes
out
follow
him
keep
your
safe
distance
and
dog
him
if
you
can
and
if
i
lose
him
come
back
home
station
yourself
now
where
he
wo
notice
you
that
arch
there
should
serve
we
had
been
standing
at
the
street
corner
sheltered
by
a
balcony
over
our
heads
from
the
view
of
peyrot
window
monsieur
i
said
i
do
wish
you
would
bring
vigo
back
with
you
félix
he
laughed
you
are
the
worst
courtier
i
ever
saw
i
crossed
the
street
as
he
told
me
glancing
up
at
the
third
story
of
the
house
of
the
gilded
shears
no
watcher
was
visible
from
the
archway
which
was
entrance
to
a
court
of
tall
houses
i
could
well
command
peyrot
door
myself
in
deep
shadow
étienne
nodded
to
me
and
walked
off
whistling
staring
full
in
the
face
every
one
he
met
i
would
fain
have
occupied
myself
as
we
guessed
the
knave
peyrot
to
be
doing
and
shut
mine
aching
eyes
in
sleep
but
i
was
sternly
determined
to
be
faithful
to
my
trust
and
though
for
my
greater
comfort
cold
enough
comfort
it
was
i
sat
me
down
on
the
yet
i
kept
my
eyelids
propped
open
my
eyes
on
peyrot
door
i
was
helped
in
carrying
out
my
virtuous
resolve
by
the
fact
that
the
court
was
populous
and
my
carcass
in
the
entrance
much
in
the
way
of
the
busy
so
that
full
half
of
them
swore
at
me
and
the
half
of
that
half
kicked
me
the
hard
part
was
that
i
could
not
fight
them
because
of
keeping
my
eyes
on
peyrot
door
he
delayed
so
long
and
so
long
that
i
feared
with
shamed
misgiving
i
must
have
let
him
slip
when
at
length
on
the
very
stroke
of
eleven
he
sauntered
forth
he
was
yawning
prodigiously
but
set
off
past
my
lair
at
a
smart
pace
i
followed
at
goodly
distance
but
never
once
did
he
glance
around
he
led
the
way
straight
to
the
sign
of
the
bonne
femme
illustration
at
the
bonne
femme
i
entered
two
minutes
after
him
passing
from
the
cabaret
where
my
men
were
not
to
the
where
to
my
relief
they
were
at
two
huge
fireplaces
savoury
soups
bubbled
juicy
rabbits
simmered
fat
capons
roasted
the
smell
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
a
concourse
of
people
was
about
gentles
and
burghers
seated
at
table
or
passing
in
and
out
waiters
running
back
and
forth
from
the
fires
drawers
from
the
cabaret
i
paused
to
scan
the
throng
jostled
by
one
and
another
before
i
descried
my
master
and
my
knave
étienne
the
prompter
at
the
rendezvous
had
like
a
philosopher
ordered
dinner
but
he
had
deserted
it
now
and
stood
with
peyrot
their
backs
to
the
company
their
elbows
on
the
deep
their
heads
close
together
i
came
up
suddenly
to
peyrot
side
making
him
jump
oh
it
you
my
little
gentleman
he
exclaimed
smiling
to
show
all
his
firm
teeth
as
white
and
even
as
a
court
beauty
he
looked
in
the
best
of
humours
as
was
not
wonderful
considering
that
he
was
engaged
in
fastening
up
in
the
breast
of
his
doublet
something
hard
and
lumpy
étienne
held
up
a
packet
for
me
to
see
before
peyrot
shielding
body
it
was
tied
with
red
cord
and
sealed
with
a
spread
falcon
over
the
tiny
letters
in
the
corner
was
written
very
small
smiling
he
put
it
into
the
breast
of
his
doublet
monsieur
my
scamp
said
to
him
with
close
lips
that
the
room
might
not
hear
you
are
a
gentleman
if
there
ever
comes
a
day
when
is
down
and
you
are
up
i
shall
be
pleased
to
serve
you
as
well
as
i
have
served
him
i
hanker
not
for
such
service
as
you
have
given
him
étienne
answered
peyrot
eyes
twinkled
brighter
than
ever
i
have
said
it
i
will
serve
you
as
vigourously
as
i
have
served
him
bear
me
in
mind
monsieur
come
félix
was
all
my
lord
answer
peyrot
sprang
forward
to
detain
us
monsieur
will
you
not
dine
with
me
both
of
you
i
beg
i
will
have
every
wine
the
cellar
affords
no
said
étienne
carelessly
not
deigning
to
anger
but
there
is
my
dinner
for
you
an
you
like
i
have
paid
for
it
but
i
have
other
business
than
to
eat
it
bidding
a
waiter
serve
peyrot
he
walked
from
the
room
without
other
glance
at
him
a
slight
shade
fell
over
the
reckless
scampish
face
he
was
a
moment
vexed
that
we
scorned
him
merely
vexed
i
think
shamed
not
at
all
he
knew
not
the
feel
of
it
even
in
the
brief
space
i
watched
him
as
i
passed
to
the
door
his
visage
cleared
and
he
sat
him
down
contentedly
to
finish
étienne
veal
broth
my
lord
paced
along
rapidly
and
gladly
on
fire
to
be
before
monsieur
with
the
packet
but
one
little
cloud
transient
as
peyrot
passed
across
his
lightsome
countenance
i
would
that
knave
were
of
my
rank
he
said
i
had
not
left
him
without
slapping
a
glove
in
his
face
that
peyrot
had
come
off
put
me
out
of
patience
too
but
i
regretted
the
gold
we
had
given
him
more
than
the
wounds
we
had
not
the
money
on
the
contrary
troubled
étienne
no
whit
what
he
had
never
toiled
for
he
parted
with
lightly
we
came
to
our
gates
and
went
straightway
up
the
stairs
to
cabinet
he
sprang
to
meet
us
at
the
door
snatching
the
packet
from
his
son
eager
hand
well
done
étienne
my
champion
an
you
brought
me
the
crown
of
france
i
were
not
so
pleased
the
flush
of
joy
at
generous
praise
of
good
work
kindled
on
cheek
it
were
hard
to
say
which
of
the
two
messieurs
beamed
the
more
delightedly
on
the
other
my
son
you
have
brought
me
back
my
honour
spoke
monsieur
more
quietly
the
exuberance
of
his
delight
abating
but
leaving
him
none
the
less
happy
if
you
had
sinned
against
me
which
i
do
not
admit
dear
lad
it
were
more
than
made
up
for
now
ah
monsieur
i
have
often
asked
myself
of
late
what
i
was
born
for
now
i
know
it
was
for
this
morning
for
this
and
many
more
mornings
étienne
monsieur
made
gay
answer
laying
a
hand
on
his
son
shoulder
courage
comrade
we
have
our
lady
yet
he
smiled
at
him
hearteningly
and
turned
away
to
his
for
all
his
sympathy
he
was
as
was
natural
more
interested
in
his
papers
than
in
mlle
de
montluc
i
get
this
off
my
hands
at
once
he
went
on
with
the
effect
of
talking
to
himself
rather
than
to
us
it
shall
go
straight
off
to
lemaître
you
better
go
to
bed
both
of
you
my
faith
you
made
a
night
of
it
wo
you
take
me
for
your
messenger
monsieur
you
need
a
trusty
one
a
kindly
offer
étienne
but
you
have
earned
your
rest
and
you
true
as
you
are
are
yet
not
the
only
staunch
servant
i
have
god
be
thanked
gilles
will
take
this
straight
from
my
hand
to
lemaître
he
had
inclosed
the
packet
in
a
clean
wrapper
but
now
a
thought
striking
him
he
took
it
out
again
i
best
break
off
the
royal
seal
lest
it
be
spied
among
the
president
papers
i
scratch
out
my
initial
too
the
cipher
tells
nothing
he
is
not
likely
to
leave
it
about
monsieur
no
but
this
time
we
provide
for
every
chance
we
take
all
the
precautions
ingenuity
can
devise
or
patience
execute
he
crushed
the
seal
in
his
fingers
and
took
the
to
scrape
the
wax
away
it
slipped
and
severed
the
cords
of
its
own
accord
the
stiff
paper
of
the
flap
unfolded
the
cipher
seems
as
determined
to
show
itself
to
me
again
as
if
i
were
in
danger
of
forgetting
it
monsieur
said
idly
the
truth
is
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
word
snatching
up
the
packet
slapping
it
wide
open
tearing
it
sheet
from
sheet
each
was
absolutely
blank
xxiv
étienne
forgetting
his
manners
snatched
the
papers
from
his
father
hand
turning
them
about
and
about
not
able
to
believe
his
senses
a
man
hurled
over
a
cliff
plunging
in
one
moment
from
flowery
lawns
into
a
turbulent
sea
might
feel
as
he
did
but
the
seal
he
stammered
the
seal
was
genuine
monsieur
answered
startled
as
he
how
your
fellow
could
have
the
king
signet
see
étienne
cried
scratching
at
the
fragments
this
is
it
dunce
that
i
am
not
to
have
guessed
it
look
there
is
a
layer
of
paper
embedded
in
the
wax
look
he
cut
the
seal
out
smeared
hot
wax
on
the
false
packet
pressed
in
the
seal
and
curled
the
new
wax
over
the
edge
it
was
cleverly
done
the
seal
is
but
little
thicker
little
larger
than
before
it
did
not
look
tampered
with
would
you
have
suspected
it
monsieur
he
demanded
piteously
i
had
no
thought
of
it
but
this
peyrot
it
may
not
yet
be
too
late
i
will
go
back
étienne
cried
darting
to
the
door
but
monsieur
laid
forcible
hands
on
him
not
you
étienne
you
were
hurt
yesterday
you
have
not
closed
your
eyes
for
hours
i
do
want
a
dead
son
i
blame
you
not
for
the
failure
not
another
man
of
us
all
would
have
come
so
near
success
dolt
i
should
have
known
he
could
not
deal
honestly
étienne
cried
i
should
have
known
he
would
trick
me
but
i
did
not
think
to
doubt
the
crest
i
should
have
opened
it
there
in
the
inn
but
it
was
lemaître
sealed
packet
however
peyrot
sat
down
to
my
dinner
i
can
be
back
before
he
has
finished
his
three
kinds
of
wine
stop
étienne
monsieur
commanded
i
forbid
you
you
are
gray
with
fatigue
vigo
shall
go
étienne
turned
on
him
in
fiery
protest
then
the
blaze
in
his
eyes
flickered
out
and
he
made
obedient
salute
so
be
it
let
him
go
i
am
no
use
i
bungle
everything
i
touch
but
he
may
accomplish
something
he
flung
himself
down
on
the
bench
in
the
corner
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
weary
chagrined
disheartened
a
might
have
copied
him
for
a
figure
of
defeat
go
find
vigo
monsieur
bade
me
and
then
get
you
to
bed
i
obeyed
both
orders
with
all
alacrity
i
too
smarted
but
mine
was
the
private
disappointment
not
the
general
who
had
planned
the
campaign
the
credit
of
the
rescue
was
none
of
mine
no
more
was
the
blame
of
failure
i
need
not
rack
myself
with
questioning
had
i
in
this
or
that
done
differently
should
i
not
have
triumphed
i
had
done
only
what
i
was
told
yet
i
was
part
of
the
expedition
i
could
not
but
share
the
grief
if
i
did
not
wet
my
pillow
with
my
tears
it
was
because
i
could
not
keep
awake
long
enough
whatever
my
sorrows
speedily
they
slipped
from
me
i
roused
with
a
start
from
deep
dreamless
sleep
and
then
wondered
whether
after
all
i
had
waked
here
to
be
sure
was
marcel
bed
on
which
i
had
lain
down
there
was
the
high
through
which
the
westering
sun
now
poured
there
was
the
wardrobe
open
with
sunday
suit
hanging
on
the
peg
here
were
the
two
stools
the
little
image
of
the
virgin
on
the
wall
but
here
was
also
something
else
so
out
of
place
in
the
chamber
of
a
page
that
i
pinched
myself
to
make
sure
it
was
real
at
my
elbow
on
the
pallet
lay
a
box
of
some
fine
foreign
wood
beautifully
grained
by
god
and
polished
by
grateful
man
it
was
about
as
large
as
my
lord
bound
at
the
edges
with
shining
brass
and
having
long
brass
hinges
wrought
in
a
design
of
leaves
and
flowers
beside
the
box
were
set
three
shallow
trays
lined
with
blue
velvet
and
filled
full
of
goldsmith
chains
linked
or
twisted
bracelets
in
the
form
of
yellow
snakes
with
green
eyes
buckles
with
ivory
teeth
thick
with
pearls
and
with
precious
stones
i
stared
bedazzled
from
the
display
to
him
who
stood
as
showman
this
was
a
handsome
lad
seemingly
no
older
than
i
though
taller
with
a
shock
of
black
hair
rough
and
curly
and
dark
smooth
face
very
boyish
and
pleasant
he
was
dressed
well
in
bourgeois
fashion
yet
there
was
about
him
and
his
apparel
something
i
could
not
tell
what
unfamiliar
different
from
us
others
he
meeting
my
eye
smiled
in
the
friendliest
way
like
a
child
and
said
in
italian
good
day
to
you
my
little
gentleman
i
had
still
the
uncertain
feeling
that
i
must
be
in
a
dream
for
why
should
an
italian
jeweller
be
displaying
his
treasures
to
me
a
penniless
page
but
the
dream
was
amusing
i
was
in
no
haste
to
wake
i
knew
my
italian
well
enough
for
monsieur
confessor
the
father
francesco
who
had
followed
him
into
exile
was
florentine
and
as
he
always
spoke
his
own
tongue
to
monsieur
and
i
was
always
at
the
heels
i
picked
up
a
deal
of
it
after
monsieur
going
the
father
already
a
victim
poor
man
to
the
of
which
he
died
stayed
behind
with
us
and
i
found
a
pricking
pleasure
in
talking
with
him
in
the
speech
he
loved
of
monsieur
roman
journey
of
his
exploits
in
the
war
of
the
three
henrys
therefore
the
words
came
easily
to
my
lips
to
answer
this
lad
from
over
the
alps
i
give
you
good
day
friend
he
looked
somewhat
surprised
and
more
than
pleased
breaking
at
once
into
voluble
speech
the
best
of
greetings
to
you
young
sir
now
what
can
i
sell
you
this
fine
day
i
have
not
been
half
a
week
in
this
big
city
of
yours
yet
already
i
have
but
one
boxful
of
trinkets
left
they
are
noble
customers
these
gallants
of
paris
i
have
not
to
show
them
my
wares
twice
i
can
tell
you
they
know
what
key
will
unlock
their
fair
mistresses
hearts
and
now
what
can
i
sell
you
my
little
gentleman
to
buy
your
sweetheart
kisses
nay
i
have
no
sweetheart
i
said
and
if
i
had
she
would
not
wear
these
gauds
she
would
if
she
could
get
them
then
he
retorted
now
let
me
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
my
friend
for
i
see
you
are
but
young
buy
this
gold
chain
of
me
or
this
ring
with
this
little
dove
on
it
see
how
cunningly
wrought
and
you
not
lack
long
for
a
sweetheart
his
words
huffed
me
a
bit
for
he
spoke
as
if
he
were
vastly
my
senior
i
want
no
sweetheart
i
returned
with
dignity
to
be
bought
with
gold
nay
he
cried
quickly
but
when
your
own
valour
and
prowess
have
inflamed
her
with
passion
you
should
be
willing
to
reward
her
devotion
and
set
at
rest
her
suspense
by
a
suitable
gift
i
looked
at
him
uneasily
for
i
had
a
suspicion
that
he
might
be
making
fun
of
me
but
his
countenance
was
as
guileless
as
a
kitten
well
i
tell
you
again
i
have
no
sweetheart
and
i
want
no
sweetheart
i
said
i
have
no
time
to
bother
with
girls
at
once
he
abandoned
the
subject
seeing
that
he
was
making
naught
by
it
the
messer
is
very
much
occupied
he
asked
with
exceeding
deference
the
messer
has
no
leisure
for
trifling
in
boudoirs
he
is
occupied
with
great
matters
oh
that
can
i
well
believe
and
i
cry
the
pardon
for
when
the
mind
is
taken
up
with
affairs
of
state
it
is
distasteful
to
listen
even
for
a
moment
to
light
talk
of
maids
and
jewels
again
i
eyed
him
challengingly
but
he
with
face
utterly
unconscious
was
sorting
over
his
treasures
i
made
up
my
mind
his
queer
talk
was
but
the
outlandish
way
of
a
foreigner
he
looked
at
me
again
serious
and
respectful
the
messer
must
often
be
engaged
in
great
risks
in
perilous
encounters
is
it
not
so
then
he
will
do
well
to
carry
ever
over
his
heart
the
sacred
image
of
our
lord
he
held
up
to
my
inspection
a
silver
rosary
from
which
depended
a
crucifix
of
ivory
the
sad
image
of
the
dying
christ
carved
upon
it
even
in
monsieur
chapel
even
in
the
church
at
quentin
was
nothing
so
masterfully
wrought
as
this
figurine
to
be
held
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
the
tears
started
in
my
eyes
to
look
at
it
and
i
crossed
myself
in
reverence
i
bethought
me
how
i
had
trampled
on
my
crucifix
the
stranger
all
unwittingly
had
struck
a
i
had
committed
grave
offence
against
god
but
perhaps
if
putting
gewgaws
aside
i
should
give
my
all
for
this
cross
he
would
call
the
account
even
i
knew
nothing
of
the
value
of
a
carving
such
as
this
but
i
remembered
i
was
not
moneyless
and
i
said
albeit
somewhat
shyly
i
can
not
take
the
rosary
but
i
should
like
well
the
crucifix
but
then
i
have
only
ten
pistoles
ten
pistoles
he
repeated
contemptuously
corpo
di
bacco
the
workmanship
alone
is
worth
twenty
then
viewing
my
fallen
visage
he
added
however
i
have
received
fair
treatment
in
this
house
beshrew
me
but
i
have
i
have
made
good
sales
to
your
young
count
what
sort
of
master
is
he
this
le
comte
de
mar
oh
there
nobody
like
him
i
answered
except
of
course
le
duc
ah
then
you
have
two
masters
he
inquired
curiously
yet
with
a
certain
careless
air
it
struck
me
suddenly
overwhelmingly
that
he
was
a
spy
come
here
under
the
guise
of
an
honest
tradesman
but
he
should
gain
nothing
from
me
this
is
the
house
of
the
duke
of
quentin
i
said
surely
you
could
not
come
in
at
the
gate
without
discovering
that
he
is
a
very
grand
seigneur
then
this
duke
assuredly
i
replied
cautiously
more
of
a
man
than
the
comte
de
mar
i
would
have
told
him
to
mind
his
own
business
had
it
not
been
for
my
hopes
of
the
crucifix
if
he
planned
to
sell
it
to
me
cheap
thereby
hoping
to
gain
information
marry
i
saw
no
reason
why
i
should
not
buy
it
at
his
price
and
withhold
the
information
so
i
made
civil
answer
they
are
both
as
gallant
gentlemen
as
any
living
about
this
cross
now
oh
yes
he
answered
at
once
accepting
with
willingness
well
feigned
i
thought
the
change
of
topic
you
can
give
me
ten
pistoles
say
you
is
making
you
a
present
of
the
treasure
yet
since
i
have
received
good
treatment
at
the
hands
of
your
master
i
will
give
it
to
you
you
shall
have
your
cross
with
suspicions
now
at
point
of
certainty
i
drew
out
my
pouch
from
under
my
pillow
and
counted
into
his
hand
the
ten
pieces
which
were
my
store
my
rosary
i
drew
out
likewise
i
had
broken
it
when
i
shattered
the
cross
but
one
of
the
had
tied
it
together
for
me
with
a
thread
and
it
served
very
well
the
italian
unhooked
the
delicate
carving
from
the
silver
chain
and
hung
it
on
my
wooden
one
which
i
threw
over
my
neck
vastly
pleased
with
my
new
possession
virgin
was
a
botch
compared
with
it
i
remembered
that
mademoiselle
who
had
given
me
half
my
wealth
the
half
that
won
me
the
rest
had
bidden
me
buy
something
in
the
marts
of
paris
and
i
told
myself
with
pride
that
she
could
not
fail
to
hold
me
high
did
she
know
how
passing
by
all
vanities
i
had
spent
my
whole
store
for
a
holy
image
few
boys
of
my
age
would
be
capable
of
the
like
certes
i
had
done
piously
and
should
now
take
a
further
pious
joy
my
purchase
safe
on
my
neck
in
thwarting
the
wiles
of
this
serpent
i
would
play
with
him
awhile
tease
and
baffle
him
before
handing
him
over
in
triumph
to
vigo
sure
enough
he
began
as
i
had
expected
this
de
mar
he
is
a
very
good
master
i
suppose
yes
i
said
without
enthusiasm
he
has
always
treated
you
well
i
bethought
myself
of
the
trick
i
had
played
successfully
with
the
officer
of
the
burgess
guard
why
yes
i
suppose
so
i
have
only
known
him
two
days
but
you
have
known
him
well
you
have
seen
much
of
him
he
demanded
with
eagerness
but
not
so
very
much
i
made
tepid
answer
i
have
not
been
with
him
all
the
time
of
these
two
days
i
have
seen
really
very
little
of
him
and
you
know
not
whether
or
no
he
be
a
good
master
oh
pretty
good
he
sprang
forward
to
deal
me
a
stinging
box
on
the
ear
i
was
out
of
bed
at
one
bound
scattering
the
trinkets
in
a
golden
rain
and
rushing
for
him
he
retreated
before
me
it
was
to
save
his
jewels
but
i
fool
that
i
was
thought
it
pure
fear
of
me
i
dashed
at
him
all
headlong
confidence
the
next
i
knew
he
had
somehow
twisted
his
foot
between
mine
and
tripped
me
before
i
could
grapple
never
was
wight
more
confounded
to
find
himself
on
the
floor
i
was
starting
up
again
unhurt
when
i
saw
something
that
made
me
to
forget
my
purpose
i
sat
still
where
i
was
with
dropped
jaw
and
bulging
eyes
for
his
hair
that
had
been
black
was
golden
ventre
bleu
i
said
and
so
you
know
not
you
little
villain
whether
you
have
a
good
master
or
not
but
how
was
i
to
dream
it
was
monsieur
i
cried
confounded
i
knew
there
was
something
queer
about
him
about
you
i
mean
about
the
person
i
took
you
for
that
is
i
knew
there
was
something
wrong
about
you
that
is
to
say
i
mean
i
thought
there
was
i
mean
i
knew
he
was
what
he
seemed
you
were
not
and
peyrot
fooled
us
and
i
want
to
be
fooled
again
then
i
am
a
good
master
he
demanded
truculently
advancing
upon
me
i
put
up
my
hands
to
my
ears
the
best
monsieur
and
monsieur
wrestled
well
too
i
ca
prove
that
by
you
félix
he
retorted
and
laughed
in
my
nettled
face
well
if
you
not
trampled
on
my
jewels
i
forgive
your
contumacy
if
i
had
my
bare
toes
had
done
them
no
harm
i
crawled
about
the
floor
gathering
them
all
up
and
putting
them
on
the
bed
where
i
presently
sat
down
myself
to
stare
at
him
trying
to
realize
him
for
le
comte
he
had
seated
himself
too
and
was
dusting
his
trampled
wig
and
clapping
it
on
again
he
had
shaved
off
his
mustaches
and
the
tuft
on
his
chin
and
the
whole
look
of
him
was
changed
a
year
had
gone
for
every
stroke
of
the
razor
he
seemed
such
a
boy
so
particularly
guileless
he
had
stained
his
face
so
well
that
it
looked
for
all
the
world
as
though
the
southern
sun
had
done
it
for
him
his
eyebrows
and
lashes
were
dark
by
nature
his
wig
came
much
lower
over
his
forehead
than
did
his
own
hair
and
altered
the
upper
part
of
his
face
as
much
as
the
shaving
of
the
lower
only
his
eyes
were
the
same
he
had
had
his
back
to
the
window
at
first
and
i
had
not
noted
them
but
now
that
he
had
turned
his
eyes
gleamed
so
light
as
to
be
fairly
startling
in
his
dark
face
like
stars
in
a
stormy
sky
well
then
how
do
you
like
me
monsieur
confounds
me
it
witchery
i
can
not
get
used
to
him
that
as
i
would
have
it
he
returned
coming
over
to
the
bedside
to
arrange
his
treasures
for
if
i
look
new
to
you
i
think
i
may
look
so
to
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
monsieur
goes
to
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
as
a
jeweller
i
cried
enlightened
aye
and
if
the
ladies
do
not
crowd
about
me
he
broke
off
with
a
gesture
and
put
his
trays
back
in
his
box
well
i
wondered
monsieur
i
wondered
if
we
were
going
to
sell
ornaments
to
peyrot
he
locked
the
box
and
proceeded
solemnly
and
thoroughly
to
damn
peyrot
he
cursed
him
waking
cursed
him
sleeping
cursed
him
eating
cursed
him
drinking
cursed
him
walking
riding
sitting
cursed
him
summer
cursed
him
winter
cursed
him
young
cursed
him
old
living
dying
and
dead
i
inferred
that
the
packet
had
not
been
recovered
no
pardieu
vigo
went
straight
on
horseback
to
the
bonne
femme
but
peyrot
had
vanished
so
he
galloped
round
to
the
rue
tournelles
whither
he
had
sent
two
of
our
men
before
him
but
the
bird
was
flown
he
had
been
home
half
an
hour
before
he
left
the
inn
just
after
us
had
paid
his
arrears
of
rent
surrendered
his
key
and
taken
away
his
chest
with
all
his
worldly
goods
in
it
on
the
shoulders
of
two
porters
bound
for
parts
unknown
gilles
is
scouring
paris
for
him
mordieu
i
wish
him
luck
his
face
betokened
little
hope
of
gilles
we
both
kept
chagrined
silence
and
we
thought
him
sleeping
presently
cried
he
well
he
added
rising
that
milk
spilt
no
use
crying
over
it
plan
a
better
venture
that
the
only
course
monsieur
is
gone
back
to
denis
to
report
to
the
king
marry
he
makes
as
little
of
these
gates
as
if
he
were
a
and
they
the
net
time
was
when
he
thought
he
must
plan
and
prepare
and
know
the
captain
of
the
watch
and
go
masked
at
midnight
he
has
got
bravely
over
that
now
he
bounces
in
and
out
as
easily
as
kiss
my
hand
i
pray
he
may
not
try
it
once
too
often
mayenne
dare
not
touch
him
what
mayenne
may
dare
is
not
good
betting
monsieur
thinks
he
dares
not
monsieur
has
come
through
so
many
perils
of
late
he
is
happily
convinced
he
bears
a
charmed
life
félix
do
you
come
with
me
to
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
ah
monsieur
i
cried
bethinking
myself
that
i
had
forgotten
to
dress
nay
you
need
not
don
these
clothes
he
interposed
with
a
look
of
wickedness
which
i
could
not
interpret
wait
i
back
anon
he
darted
out
of
the
room
to
return
speedily
with
an
armful
of
apparel
which
he
threw
on
the
bed
monsieur
i
gasped
in
horror
it
woman
gear
verily
monsieur
you
can
not
mean
me
to
wear
this
i
mean
it
precisely
monsieur
why
look
you
félix
he
laughed
how
else
am
i
to
take
you
you
were
at
pains
to
make
yourself
conspicuous
in
de
mayenne
salon
they
will
recognize
you
as
quickly
as
me
oh
monsieur
put
me
in
a
wig
in
cap
and
bells
an
you
like
i
will
be
monsieur
clown
anything
only
not
this
i
never
heard
of
a
jeweller
accompanied
by
his
clown
nor
have
i
any
in
my
armoires
but
since
i
have
exerted
myself
to
borrow
this
toggery
and
a
fine
big
lass
is
the
owner
so
i
think
it
will
fit
you
must
wear
it
i
was
like
to
burst
with
mortification
i
stood
there
in
dumb
agonized
appeal
oh
well
then
you
need
not
go
at
all
if
you
go
you
go
as
félicie
but
you
may
stay
at
home
if
it
likes
you
better
that
settled
me
i
would
have
gone
in
my
sooner
than
not
go
at
all
and
belike
he
knew
it
i
began
arraying
myself
sullenly
and
clumsily
in
the
murrain
petticoats
there
was
a
full
kirtle
of
gray
wool
falling
to
my
ankles
and
a
white
apron
there
was
a
white
blouse
with
a
wide
collar
and
a
scarlet
bodice
laced
with
black
cords
over
a
green
tongue
i
was
soon
in
such
a
desperate
tangle
over
these
divers
garments
so
utterly
muddled
as
to
which
to
put
on
first
and
which
side
forward
and
which
end
up
and
where
and
how
by
the
grace
of
god
to
fasten
them
that
étienne
with
roars
of
laughter
came
unsteadily
to
my
aid
he
insisted
on
stuffing
the
whole
of
my
jerkin
under
my
blouse
to
give
my
figure
the
proper
curves
and
to
make
me
a
waist
he
drew
the
till
i
was
like
to
suffocate
his
mirth
had
by
this
time
got
me
to
laughing
so
that
every
time
he
pulled
me
in
a
fit
of
merriment
would
jerk
the
laces
from
his
fingers
before
he
could
tie
them
this
happened
once
and
again
and
the
more
it
happened
the
more
we
laughed
and
the
less
he
could
dress
me
i
ached
in
every
rib
and
the
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
washing
little
clean
channels
in
the
stain
félix
this
will
never
do
he
gasped
when
at
length
he
could
speak
never
after
a
carouse
have
i
been
so
maudlin
compose
yourself
for
the
love
of
heaven
think
of
something
serious
think
of
me
think
of
peyrot
think
of
mayenne
think
of
lucas
think
of
what
will
happen
to
us
now
if
mayenne
know
us
for
ourselves
enough
monsieur
i
said
i
am
sobered
but
even
now
that
i
held
still
we
could
not
draw
the
last
holes
in
the
nearly
together
nay
monsieur
i
can
never
wear
it
like
this
i
panted
when
he
had
tied
it
as
tight
as
he
could
i
shall
die
or
i
shall
burst
the
seams
he
had
perforce
to
give
me
more
room
he
pulled
the
apron
higher
to
cover
gaps
and
fastened
a
bunch
of
keys
and
a
pocket
at
my
waist
he
set
a
brown
wig
on
my
head
nearly
covered
by
a
black
mortier
with
its
wide
scarf
hanging
down
my
back
hang
me
but
you
make
a
fine
strapping
grisette
he
cried
proud
of
me
as
if
i
were
a
picture
he
the
painter
félix
you
no
notion
how
handsome
you
look
dame
you
defrauded
the
world
when
you
contrived
to
be
born
a
boy
i
thank
my
stars
i
was
born
a
boy
i
declared
i
would
get
into
this
toggery
for
any
one
else
on
earth
i
tell
monsieur
that
flat
you
must
change
your
shoes
he
cried
eagerly
your
hobnails
spoil
all
i
put
one
of
his
gossip
shoes
on
the
floor
beside
my
foot
now
monsieur
i
ask
you
how
am
i
to
get
into
that
shall
i
fetch
you
vigo
he
grinned
no
constant
i
said
instantly
thinking
how
it
would
make
him
writhe
to
lend
them
constant
best
he
promised
disappearing
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
to
see
my
lord
running
errands
for
me
perhaps
he
forgot
after
a
month
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
that
such
things
as
pages
existed
or
more
likely
he
did
not
care
to
take
the
household
into
his
confidence
he
was
back
soon
with
a
pair
of
scarlet
hose
and
shoes
of
red
morocco
the
gayest
affairs
you
ever
saw
also
he
brought
a
for
me
to
look
on
my
beauty
nay
monsieur
i
said
with
a
sulk
that
started
anew
his
laughter
i
not
take
it
i
want
not
to
see
myself
but
monsieur
will
do
well
to
examine
his
own
countenance
pardieu
i
should
say
so
he
cried
i
must
go
repair
myself
and
you
félix
félicie
must
be
fed
i
was
in
truth
as
hollow
as
a
drum
yet
i
cried
out
that
i
had
rather
starve
than
venture
into
the
kitchen
you
flatter
yourself
he
retorted
you
not
be
known
old
jumel
will
give
you
the
pick
of
the
larder
for
a
kiss
he
roared
in
my
sullen
face
and
added
relenting
well
then
i
will
send
one
of
the
lackeys
up
with
a
salver
the
lazy
beggars
have
naught
else
to
do
i
bolted
the
door
after
him
and
when
the
man
brought
my
tray
bade
him
set
it
down
outside
he
informed
me
through
the
panels
that
he
would
go
drown
himself
before
he
would
be
content
to
lie
slugabed
the
livelong
day
while
his
betters
waited
on
him
i
trembled
for
fear
in
his
virtuous
scorn
he
should
take
his
fardel
away
again
but
he
had
had
his
orders
when
after
listening
to
his
footsteps
descending
the
stairs
i
reached
out
a
cautious
arm
the
tray
was
on
the
floor
the
generous
meat
and
wine
put
new
heart
into
me
by
the
time
my
lord
returned
i
was
eager
for
the
enterprise
have
you
finished
he
demanded
faith
i
see
you
have
then
let
us
start
it
grows
late
the
shadows
like
good
mussulmans
are
stretching
to
the
east
i
must
catch
the
ladies
in
their
chambers
before
supper
come
we
take
the
box
between
us
why
monsieur
i
carry
that
on
my
shoulders
what
my
lass
on
your
dainty
shoulders
nay
make
the
townsfolk
stare
i
gnawed
my
lip
in
silence
he
exclaimed
now
never
have
i
seen
a
maid
fresh
from
the
convent
blush
so
prettily
i
give
my
right
hand
to
walk
you
out
past
the
i
shrank
as
a
snail
when
you
touch
its
horns
he
cried
marry
but
i
will
though
now
i
unlike
sir
snail
had
no
snug
little
fortress
to
take
refuge
in
i
might
writhe
but
i
could
not
defend
myself
as
you
will
monsieur
i
said
setting
my
teeth
hard
nay
i
dare
not
those
fellows
would
follow
us
laughing
to
the
doors
of
lorraine
house
itself
i
told
none
of
this
prank
i
have
even
contrived
to
send
all
the
lackeys
out
of
doors
on
fools
errands
sneak
out
like
thieves
by
the
postern
come
tread
your
wariest
on
tiptoe
with
the
caution
of
malefactors
we
crept
from
stair
to
stair
giggling
under
our
breath
like
the
callow
lad
and
saucy
lass
we
looked
to
be
we
won
in
safety
to
the
postern
and
came
out
to
face
the
terrible
eye
of
the
world
xxv
double
félix
we
are
speaking
in
our
own
tongue
it
is
such
lapses
as
these
bring
men
to
the
gallows
italian
from
this
word
my
girl
monsieur
i
have
no
notion
how
to
bear
myself
what
to
say
i
answered
uneasily
say
as
little
as
you
can
for
i
confess
your
voice
and
your
hands
give
me
pause
otherwise
i
would
take
you
anywhere
for
a
lass
your
part
must
be
the
shy
maiden
my
faith
you
look
the
rôle
your
cheeks
are
poppies
you
will
follow
docile
at
my
heels
while
i
tell
lies
for
two
i
have
the
hope
that
the
ladies
will
heed
me
and
my
jewels
more
than
you
monsieur
could
we
not
go
safelier
at
night
i
have
thought
of
that
but
at
night
the
household
gathers
in
the
salon
we
should
run
the
gantlet
of
a
hundred
looks
and
tongues
while
now
if
we
have
luck
we
may
win
to
mademoiselle
own
chamber
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
walked
along
in
a
well
he
resumed
presently
coming
back
to
the
needs
of
the
moment
let
us
know
our
names
and
station
i
am
giovanni
rossini
son
of
the
famous
goldsmith
of
florence

sister

came
to
paris
in
the
legate
train
trade
being
dull
at
home

the
hills
for
the
hot
month
of
course

foot
out
of
france

but

francesco
has
talked
to
me
much
of
his
city
of
florence
good
you
can
then
make
shift
to
answer
a
question
or
two
if

to
it
your
italian

swear

of
excellent
quality
you
speak
french
like
the
picard

like
a
gentleman
that
is
to
say
like
a
lady
monsieur
i
bemoaned
miserably
i
shall
never
come
through
it
alive
never
in
the
world
they
will
know
me
in
the
flick
of
an
eye
for
a
boy
i
know
they
will
why
the
folk
we
are
passing
can
see
something
wrong
they
all
are
staring
at
me
of
course
they
stare
he
answered
tranquilly
i
should
think
some
wrong
if
they
did
not
can
your
modesty
never
understand
my
giulietta
what
a
pretty
lass
you
are
he
fell
to
laughing
at
my
discomfort
and
thus
he
full
of
gay
confidence
i
full
of
misgiving
we
came
before
the
doors
of
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
courage
he
whispered
to
me
courage
will
conquer
the
devil
himself
put
a
good
face
on
it
and
take
the
plunge
the
next
moment
he
was
in
the
archway
deluging
the
sentry
with
his
rapid
italian
nom
chien
what
all
this
what
are
you
after
the
man
shouted
at
us
to
make
us
understand
the
better
have
you
a
word
of
honest
french
in
your
head
étienne
tapping
his
box
very
brokenly
very
laboriously
stammered
forth
something
about
jewels
for
the
ladies
get
in
with
you
then
we
were
not
slow
to
obey
the
courtyard
was
deserted
nor
did
we
see
any
one
in
the
windows
of
the
house
against
which
the
afternoon
sun
struck
hotly
to
keep
out
his
unwelcome
rays
the
house
door
was
pushed
almost
shut
we
paused
a
moment
on
the
step
to
listen
to
the
voices
of
gossiping
lackeys
within
and
then
étienne
boldly
knocked
there
was
a
scurrying
in
the
hall
as
if
half
a
dozen
idlers
were
plunging
into
their
doublets
and
running
to
their
places
then
my
good
friend
pierre
opened
the
door
in
the
row
of
underlings
at
his
back
i
recognized
the
two
who
had
taken
part
in
my
flogging
the
cold
sweat
broke
out
upon
me
lest
they
in
their
turn
should
know
me
étienne
looked
from
one
to
another
with
the
childlike
smile
of
his
bare
lips
demanding
if
any
here
spoke
italian
i
answered
pierre
himself
now
what
may
your
errand
be
oh
it
soon
told
étienne
cried
volubly
as
one
delighted
to
find
himself
understood
i
am
a
jeweller
from
florence
i
am
selling
my
wares
in
your
great
houses
i
have
but
just
sold
a
necklace
to
the
duchesse
de
joyeuse
i
crave
permission
to
show
my
trinkets
to
the
fair
ladies
here
but
take
me
up
to
them
and
they
not
make
you
repent
it
go
tell
madame
pierre
bade
one
of
his
men
and
turning
again
to
us
gave
us
kindly
permission
to
set
down
our
burden
and
wait
for
incredible
good
luck
the
heavy
hangings
were
drawn
over
the
sunny
windows
making
a
soft
twilight
in
the
room
i
sidled
over
to
a
bench
in
the
far
corner
and
was
feeling
almost
safe
when
pierre
beshrew
him
called
attention
to
me
now
that
is
a
heavy
box
for
a
maid
to
help
lug
do
you
make
the
lasses
do
porters
work
you
florentines
but
i
am
a
stranger
here
étienne
explained
did
i
hire
a
porter
how
am
i
to
tell
an
honest
one
belike
he
might
run
off
with
all
my
treasures
and
where
is
poor
giovanni
then
besides
it
were
cruel
to
leave
my
little
sister
in
our
lodging
not
a
soul
to
speak
to
the
long
day
through
there
is
none
where
we
lodge
knows
italian
as
you
do
so
like
an
angel
sir
master
of
the
household
now
pierre
was
no
more
maître
than
i
was
but
that
did
not
dampen
his
pleasure
to
be
called
so
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
by
étienne
how
came
you
two
to
be
in
paris
he
asked
my
lord
proceeded
to
tell
him
i
know
not
what
glib
and
convincing
farrago
with
every
excellence
i
made
no
doubt
of
accent
and
gesture
but
i
could
not
listen
i
had
affairs
of
my
own
by
this
time
the
lackeys
had
come
up
close
round
me
more
interested
in
me
than
in
my
brother
and
the
same
jean
who
had
held
me
for
my
beating
who
had
wanted
my
coat
stripped
off
me
that
i
might
be
whacked
to
bleed
now
said
i
warrant
you
hot
and
tired
and
thirsty
mademoiselle
for
all
you
look
as
fresh
as
cress
will
you
drink
a
cup
of
wine
if
i
fetch
it
i
had
kept
my
eyes
on
the
ground
from
the
first
moment
of
encounter
in
mortal
dread
to
look
these
men
in
the
face
but
now
gaining
courage
i
raised
my
glance
and
smiled
at
him
bashfully
and
faltered
that
i
did
not
understand
he
understood
the
sense
if
not
the
words
of
my
answer
and
repeated
his
offer
slowly
loudly
i
strove
to
look
as
blank
as
the
wall
and
shook
my
head
gently
and
helplessly
and
turned
an
inquiring
gaze
to
the
others
as
if
beseeching
them
to
interpret
one
of
the
fellows
clapped
jean
on
the
shoulder
with
a
roar
of
laughter
a
fall
a
fall
he
shouted
here
the
jean
marchand
tripped
up
for
once
he
thinks
nothing
that
wears
petticoats
can
withstand
him
but
here
a
maid
that
has
a
word
to
throw
at
him
pshaw
she
does
understand
me
jean
returned
undaunted
and
promptly
pointed
a
finger
at
my
mouth
and
then
raised
his
fist
to
his
own
with
sucks
and
gulps
i
allowed
myself
to
comprehend
then
i
smiled
in
as
coquettish
a
fashion
as
i
could
contrive
and
glanced
on
the
ground
and
slowly
looked
up
again
and
nodded
the
men
burst
into
loud
applause
good
old
jean
jean
wins
well
played
jean
vive
jean
jean
flushed
with
triumph
ran
off
on
his
errand
while
i
thought
of
margot
the
steward
daughter
at
home
and
tried
to
recollect
every
air
and
grace
i
had
ever
seen
her
flaunt
before
us
lads
it
was
not
bad
fun
this
i
hid
my
hands
under
my
apron
and
spoke
not
at
all
but
sighed
and
smiled
and
blushed
under
their
stares
like
any
fine
lady
once
in
one
life
for
one
hour
it
is
rather
amusing
to
be
a
girl
but
that
is
quite
long
enough
say
jean
came
again
directly
with
a
great
silver
tankard
burgundy
pardieu
cried
one
of
his
mates
sticking
his
nose
into
the
pot
as
it
passed
him
and
full
ciel
you
must
think
your
lass
has
a
head
oh
i
shall
drink
with
her
jean
answered
i
put
out
my
hand
for
the
tankard
running
the
risk
of
my
big
betraying
me
resolved
that
he
should
not
drink
with
me
of
that
draught
when
of
a
sudden
he
leaned
over
to
snatch
a
kiss
i
dodged
him
more
frightened
than
the
shyest
maid
though
in
this
i
might
perfectly
look
a
girl
i
could
not
believe
i
should
kiss
like
one
in
a
panic
i
fled
from
jean
to
my
master
side
étienne
wheeling
about
came
near
to
laughing
out
in
my
face
when
he
remembered
his
part
and
played
it
with
a
zeal
that
was
like
to
undo
us
he
sprang
to
his
feet
drawing
his
dagger
who
insults
my
sister
he
shouted
who
is
the
dog
does
this
they
were
on
him
wrenching
the
knife
from
his
hand
wrenching
his
lame
arm
at
the
same
time
so
painfully
that
he
gasped
i
was
scared
chill
i
knew
if
they
mishandled
him
they
would
brush
the
wig
off
mind
your
manners
sirrah
jean
cried
monsieur
ardour
vanished
a
gentle
appealing
smile
spread
over
his
face
i
cry
your
pardon
sir
he
said
to
jean
then
turning
to
pierre
this
messer
does
not
understand
me
but
tell
him
i
beg
you
i
crave
his
good
pardon
i
was
but
angered
for
a
moment
that
any
should
think
to
touch
my
little
sister
i
meant
no
harm
nor
he
pierre
retorted
a
kiss
forsooth
what
do
you
expect
with
a
handsome
lass
like
that
if
you
will
take
her
about
madame
says
the
jeweller
fellow
is
to
come
up
our
messenger
announced
returning
my
lord
besought
pierre
my
knife
i
may
have
my
knife
by
the
beard
of
peter
i
swear
to
you
i
meant
no
harm
with
it
i
drew
it
in
jest
now
this
which
was
the
sole
true
statement
he
had
made
since
our
arrival
was
the
only
one
pierre
did
not
quite
believe
he
took
the
knife
from
jean
but
he
hesitated
to
hand
it
over
to
its
owner
no
he
said
you
were
angry
enough
i
know
your
italian
temper
thinking
i
keep
this
little
toy
of
yours
till
you
come
down
very
well
sir
majordomo
étienne
rejoined
indifferently
so
be
it
you
give
it
to
me
when
i
go
he
grasped
the
handle
of
the
box
and
we
followed
our
guide
up
the
stair
my
master
offering
me
the
comforting
assurance
it
really
matters
not
in
the
least
for
if
we
be
caught
the
not
yet
forged
can
save
us
we
were
ushered
into
a
large
fair
chamber
hung
with
arras
the
carpet
under
our
feet
deep
and
soft
as
moss
at
one
side
stood
the
bed
raised
on
its
dais
opposite
were
the
windows
the
between
them
covered
with
and
boxes
brushes
and
combs
very
glittering
and
grand
fluttering
about
the
room
were
some
fine
dames
and
demoiselles
brave
in
silks
and
jewels
among
them
i
was
quick
to
recognize
mme
de
mayenne
and
i
thought
i
knew
vaguely
one
or
two
other
faces
as
those
i
had
seen
before
about
her
i
started
presently
to
discover
the
little
mlle
de
tavanne
that
night
she
had
worn
and
now
she
wore
rose
but
there
was
no
mistaking
her
saucy
face
we
set
our
box
on
a
table
as
the
duchess
bade
us
and
i
helped
étienne
to
lay
out
its
contents
which
done
i
retired
to
the
background
well
content
to
leave
the
brunt
of
the
business
to
him
it
was
as
he
prophesied
they
paid
me
no
heed
whatever
he
was
smoothly
launched
on
the
third
relating
of
his
tale
i
trow
by
this
time
he
almost
believed
it
himself
certes
he
never
faltered
but
rattled
on
as
if
he
had
two
tongues
telling
in
confidential
tone
of
our
father
and
mother
our
little
brothers
and
sisters
at
home
in
florence
our
journey
with
the
legate
his
kindness
and
care
of
us
i
hoped
that
dignitary
would
not
walk
in
just
now
to
pay
his
respects
to
madame
la
générale
of
our
arrival
in
paris
and
our
wonder
and
delight
at
the
grandeur
the
like
of
which
was
not
to
be
found
in
italy
and
last
but
not
least
he
had
much
to
say
with
an
innocent
gravity
in
praise
of
the
ladies
of
paris
so
beautiful
so
witty
so
generous
they
were
all
crowding
around
him
calling
him
pretty
boy
laughing
at
his
compliments
handling
and
exclaiming
over
his
trinkets
trying
the
effect
of
a
buckle
or
a
bracelet
preening
and
cooing
like
pigeons
about
the
it
was
as
pretty
a
sight
as
ever
i
beheld
but
it
was
not
to
smile
at
such
that
we
had
risked
our
heads
of
mlle
de
montluc
there
was
no
sign
no
one
was
marking
me
and
i
wondered
if
i
might
not
slip
out
unseen
and
make
my
way
to
mademoiselle
chamber
i
knew
she
lodged
on
this
story
near
the
back
of
the
house
in
a
room
overlooking
the
little
street
and
having
a
but
i
was
somewhat
doubtful
of
my
skill
to
find
it
through
the
winding
corridors
of
a
great
palace
i
was
more
than
likely
to
meet
some
one
who
would
question
my
purpose
and
what
answer
could
i
make
i
scarce
dared
say
i
was
seeking
mademoiselle
i
am
not
ready
at
explanations
like
le
comte
yet
here
were
the
golden
moments
flying
and
our
cause
no
further
advanced
should
i
leave
it
all
to
étienne
trusting
that
when
he
had
made
his
sales
here
he
would
be
permitted
to
seek
out
the
other
ladies
of
the
house
or
should
i
strive
to
aid
him
could
i
win
in
safety
to
mademoiselle
chamber
what
a
feat
it
so
irked
me
to
be
doing
nothing
that
i
was
on
the
very
point
of
gingerly
disappearing
when
one
of
the
ladies
she
with
the
yellow
curls
the
prettiest
of
them
all
turned
suddenly
from
the
group
calling
clearly
lorance
our
hearts
stood
still
mine
did
and
i
can
vouch
for
his
as
the
heavy
swayed
aside
and
she
came
forth
she
came
listlessly
her
hair
sweeping
against
her
cheek
was
ebony
on
snow
so
white
she
was
while
under
her
blue
eyes
were
dark
rings
like
the
smears
of
an
inky
finger
étienne
let
fall
the
bracelet
he
was
holding
staring
at
her
oblivious
of
aught
else
his
brows
knotted
in
distress
his
face
afire
with
love
and
sympathy
he
made
a
step
forward
i
thought
him
about
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
when
he
recollected
himself
and
dropped
on
his
knees
to
grope
for
the
fallen
trinket
you
wanted
me
madame
she
asked
mme
de
mayenne
no
said
the
duchess
with
a
tartness
of
voice
she
seemed
to
reserve
for
mlle
de
montluc
was
mme
de
montpensier
it
was
i
the
beauty
answered
in
the
same
breath
i
want
you
to
stop
moping
over
there
in
the
corner
come
look
at
these
baubles
and
see
if
they
can
not
bring
a
sparkle
to
your
eye
fie
lorance
the
having
too
many
lovers
is
nothing
to
cry
about
it
is
an
affliction
many
and
many
a
lady
would
give
her
ears
to
undergo
take
heart
o
grace
lorance
cried
mlle
de
tavanne
if
you
go
on
looking
as
you
look
you
not
long
be
troubled
by
lovers
she
made
no
answer
to
either
but
stood
there
passively
till
it
might
be
their
pleasure
to
have
done
with
her
with
a
patient
weariness
that
it
wrung
the
heart
to
see
here
a
chain
would
become
you
vastly
lorance
mme
de
montpensier
went
on
friendlily
enough
in
her
brisk
and
careless
voice
let
me
try
it
on
your
neck
you
can
easily
coax
paul
or
some
one
to
buy
it
for
you
she
fumbled
over
the
clasp
étienne
with
a
permit
me
madame
took
it
boldly
from
her
hand
and
hooked
it
himself
about
mademoiselle
neck
he
delayed
longer
than
he
need
over
the
fastening
of
it
looking
with
burning
intentness
straight
into
her
face
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
with
a
quick
frown
of
displeasure
drawing
herself
back
then
all
at
once
the
colour
waved
across
her
face
like
the
dawn
flush
over
a
gray
sky
she
blushed
to
her
very
hair
to
her
very
ruff
then
the
red
vanished
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
she
clutched
at
her
bosom
on
the
verge
of
a
swoon
he
threw
out
his
arms
to
catch
her
instantly
she
stepped
aside
and
turning
with
a
little
unsteady
laugh
to
the
lady
at
whose
elbow
she
found
herself
asked
does
it
become
me
madame
the
little
scene
had
passed
so
quickly
that
it
seemed
none
had
marked
it
mademoiselle
had
stood
a
little
out
of
the
group
monsieur
with
his
back
to
it
and
the
ladies
were
busy
over
the
jewels
she
whom
mademoiselle
had
addressed
a
lady
older
than
any
of
the
others
answered
her
bluntly
you
look
a
shade
too
mademoiselle
for
anything
to
become
you
what
can
you
expect
mme
de
brie
mlle
blanche
promptly
demanded
mlle
de
montluc
is
weary
and
worn
from
her
vigils
at
your
bedside
mme
de
montpensier
had
the
temerity
to
laugh
but
for
the
rest
a
sort
of
little
groan
ran
through
the
company
mme
de
mayenne
bade
sharply
peace
blanche
mme
de
brie
red
with
anger
flamed
out
on
her
and
mlle
de
montluc
equally
you
impudent
minxes
is
enough
that
one
of
you
should
bring
my
son
to
his
death
without
the
other
making
a
mock
of
it
he
not
dying
began
the
irrepressible
blanche
de
tavanne
her
eyes
twinkling
with
mischief
but
whatever
naughty
answer
was
on
her
tongue
our
mademoiselle
deeper
voice
overbore
her
i
am
guiltless
of
the
charge
madame
it
was
through
no
wish
of
mine
that
your
son
with
half
the
guard
at
his
back
set
on
one
wounded
man
i
warrant
it
was
not
muttered
mlle
blanche
mar
has
turned
traitor
and
deserves
nothing
so
well
as
to
be
spitted
in
the
dark
mme
de
brie
cried
out
mademoiselle
waited
an
instant
with
flashing
eyes
meeting
madame
she
had
spoken
hotly
before
but
now
in
the
face
of
the
other
passion
she
held
herself
steady
your
charge
is
as
false
madame
as
your
wish
is
cruel
do
you
go
to
vespers
and
come
home
to
say
such
things
de
mar
is
no
traitor
he
was
never
pledged
to
us
and
may
go
over
to
navarre
when
he
will
it
was
quietly
spoken
but
the
blue
lightning
of
her
eyes
was
too
much
for
mme
de
brie
she
opened
her
mouth
to
retort
faltered
dropped
her
eyes
and
finally
turned
away
yet
seething
to
feign
interest
in
the
trinkets
it
was
a
rout
then
you
are
the
traitor
lorance
chimed
the
silvery
tones
of
mme
de
montpensier
it
is
not
denied
that
de
mar
has
gone
over
to
the
enemy
therefore
are
you
the
traitor
to
have
intercourse
with
him
she
spoke
without
heat
without
any
appearance
of
ill
feeling
hers
was
merely
the
desire
for
the
fun
of
it
to
keep
the
flurry
going
but
mademoiselle
answered
seriously
with
the
fleetingest
glance
at
le
comte
where
he
forgetting
he
knew
no
french
feasted
his
eyes
recklessly
on
her
pitying
applauding
adoring
her
i
went
softly
around
the
group
to
pull
his
sleeve
we
were
lost
if
any
turned
to
see
him
madame
mademoiselle
addressed
her
cousin
of
montpensier
speaking
particularly
clearly
and
distinctly
i
mean
ever
to
be
loyal
to
my
house
i
came
here
a
penniless
orphan
to
the
care
of
my
kinsman
mayenne
and
he
has
always
been
to
me
generous
and
loving
if
not
madame
murmured
mile
blanche
to
as
i
in
my
turn
have
been
loving
and
obedient
it
was
only
two
nights
ago
he
told
me
de
mar
must
be
as
dead
to
me
since
then
i
have
held
no
intercourse
with
him
last
night
he
came
under
my
window
i
was
not
in
my
chamber
as
you
know
i
knew
naught
of
the
affair
till
de
brie
was
brought
in
bleeding
it
was
not
by
my
will
de
mar
came
here
it
was
a
misery
to
me
i
sent
him
word
by
his
boy
that
other
night
to
leave
paris
i
implored
him
to
leave
paris
if
instead
he
comes
here
he
racks
my
heart
it
is
no
joy
to
me
no
triumph
to
me
but
a
bitter
distress
that
any
honest
gentleman
should
risk
his
life
in
a
vain
and
empty
quest
de
mar
must
go
his
ways
as
i
must
go
mine
should
he
ever
make
attempt
to
reach
me
again
and
could
i
speak
to
him
i
should
tell
him
just
what
i
have
said
now
to
you
i
pressed
monsieur
hand
in
the
endeavour
to
bring
him
back
to
sense
he
seemed
about
to
cry
out
on
her
but
mademoiselle
earnestness
had
drawn
all
eyes
pshaw
lorance
banish
these
tragedy
airs
mme
de
montpensier
rejoined
her
lightness
little
touched
a
wounded
bird
falls
by
the
rippling
water
but
the
ripples
tinkle
on
de
mar
is
not
likely
ever
to
venture
here
again
he
had
too
warm
a
welcome
last
night
my
faith
he
may
be
dead
by
this
time
dead
to
all
as
well
as
to
you
after
he
vanished
into
ferou
house
no
one
seems
to
know
what
happened
has
charles
told
you
my
sister
ferou
gave
him
up
of
course
mme
de
mayenne
answered
monsieur
has
done
what
seemed
to
him
proper
you
are
darkly
mysterious
sister
mme
de
mayenne
raised
her
eyebrows
and
smiled
as
one
solemnly
pledged
to
say
no
more
she
could
not
indeed
say
more
knowing
nothing
whatever
about
it
our
mademoiselle
spoke
in
a
low
voice
looking
straight
before
her
if
heaven
willed
that
he
escaped
last
night
i
pray
he
may
leave
the
city
i
pray
he
may
never
try
to
see
me
more
i
pray
he
may
depart
instantly
at
once
i
pray
your
prayers
may
be
answered
so
be
it
we
hear
no
more
of
him
mme
de
montpensier
retorted
tired
of
the
subject
she
herself
had
started
he
was
never
tedious
himself
de
mar
but
all
this
solemn
prating
about
him
is
duller
than
a
sermon
she
raised
a
dainty
hand
behind
which
to
yawn
audibly
come
mesdames
let
us
get
back
to
our
purchases
ma
foi
it
lucky
these
jeweller
folk
know
no
french
étienne
was
himself
again
all
smiles
and
quick
pleasantries
i
slipped
off
to
my
post
in
the
background
trying
to
get
out
of
the
eye
of
mlle
de
tavanne
who
had
been
staring
at
me
the
last
five
minutes
in
a
way
that
made
my
rise
so
suspicious
so
probing
was
it
on
my
retreat
she
did
indeed
move
her
gaze
from
me
but
only
to
watch
le
comte
as
a
hound
watches
a
thicket
it
was
a
miracle
that
none
had
pounced
on
him
before
so
reckless
had
he
been
i
perceived
with
sickening
certainty
that
mlle
de
tavanne
had
guessed
something
amiss
she
fairly
bristled
with
suspicion
with
knowledge
i
waited
from
breathless
moment
to
moment
for
announcement
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
she
held
us
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
we
could
not
flee
we
could
not
fight
we
could
do
nothing
but
wait
quietly
till
she
spoke
and
then
submit
quietly
to
arrest
later
most
like
to
death
minute
followed
minute
and
still
she
did
not
speak
hope
flowed
back
to
me
again
perhaps
after
all
we
might
escape
i
wondered
how
high
were
the
windows
from
the
ground
as
i
stole
across
the
room
to
see
mlle
de
tavanne
detached
herself
from
the
group
and
glided
unnoticed
out
of
the
door
it
was
thirty
feet
to
the
stones
below
sure
death
that
way
but
she
had
given
us
a
respite
something
might
yet
be
done
i
seized
arm
in
a
grip
that
should
tell
him
how
serious
was
our
pass
remembering
for
a
marvel
my
foreign
tongue
i
bespoke
him
brother
it
grows
late
we
must
go
it
will
soon
be
dark
we
must
go
now
now
he
turned
on
me
with
an
impatient
frown
but
before
he
could
answer
mme
de
montpensier
cried
with
a
laugh
and
do
you
fear
the
dark
wench
marry
you
look
as
if
you
could
take
care
of
yourself
nay
madame
i
protested
but
the
box
come
giovanni
if
we
linger
we
may
be
robbed
in
the
dark
streets
why
my
sister
where
are
your
manners
he
retorted
striving
to
shake
me
off
the
ladies
have
not
yet
dismissed
me
we
shall
be
robbed
of
the
box
i
persisted
and
the
night
air
is
bad
for
your
health
my
nino
if
you
stay
longer
you
will
have
trouble
in
the
throat
he
looked
at
me
hard
i
tried
to
make
my
eyes
tell
him
that
my
fear
was
no
vague
one
of
the
streets
that
his
throat
was
in
peril
here
and
now
he
understood
he
cried
with
merry
laughter
to
mme
de
montpensier
pray
excuse
her
lack
of
manners
duchessa
i
know
what
moves
the
maid
i
must
tell
you
that
in
the
house
where
we
lodge
dwells
also
a
beautiful
young
captain
beautiful
as
the
day
it
little
of
his
time
he
spends
at
home
but
we
have
observed
that
he
comes
every
evening
to
array
himself
grandly
for
supper
at
some
one
palace
we
count
our
day
lost
an
we
can
not
meet
him
by
accident
on
the
stairs
they
all
laughed
i
with
my
cheeks
burning
like
any
silly
maid
set
to
work
to
put
up
our
scattered
wares
but
despair
weighed
me
down
if
we
had
to
remember
ceremony
we
were
lost
the
ladies
were
protesting
declaring
they
had
not
made
their
bargains
and
monsieur
was
smirking
and
bowing
as
if
he
had
the
whole
night
before
him
our
one
chance
was
to
bolt
to
charge
past
the
sentry
and
flee
as
from
the
devil
i
pulled
monsieur
arm
again
and
muttered
in
his
ear
she
knows
us
she
gone
to
tell
we
must
run
for
it
at
this
moment
there
arose
from
down
the
corridor
piercing
shriek
on
shriek
the
howls
of
a
young
child
frantic
with
rage
and
terror
at
the
same
time
sounded
other
different
cries
wild
outlandish
chattering
the
baby
it
toto
oh
ciel
mme
de
mayenne
gasped
help
mesdames
she
rushed
from
the
room
mme
de
montpensier
at
her
heels
all
the
rest
following
after
all
that
is
but
one
mlle
de
montluc
started
as
the
rest
but
at
the
threshold
paused
to
let
them
pass
she
flung
the
door
to
behind
them
and
ran
back
to
monsieur
her
face
drawn
with
terror
her
hand
outstretched
monsieur
monsieur
she
panted
go
you
must
go
he
seized
her
hand
in
both
of
his
o
lorance
lorance
she
laid
her
left
hand
on
his
for
emphasis
go
go
an
you
love
me

for
answer
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
her
covering
those
sweet
hands
with
kisses
the
door
was
flung
open
mlle
de
tavanne
stood
on
the
threshold
they
started
apart
monsieur
leaping
to
his
feet
mademoiselle
springing
back
with
choking
cry
but
it
was
too
late
she
had
seen
us
she
was
rosy
with
running
her
little
face
brimming
over
with
mischief
she
flitted
into
the
room
crying
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
was
de
mar
the
gray
eyes
le
duc

done
with

i
thought
proper
i
unchained
mme
de
montpensier
monkey
and
threw
him
into
the
nursery
where
he
scared
the
baby
nearly
into
spasms
toto
carried
the
coverlet
up
on
top
of
the
tester
where
he
picking
it
to
pieces

at
him

but

i
keep
good
watch
here

in
the
petticoats
that

second
room
beyond

peste

blanche
de
tavanne
is
so
badly
off
for
lovers
that
she
need
grudge
you
yours
lorance
she
danced
out
of
the
door
while
i
ran
across
to
my
station
mlle
de
montluc
standing
bewildered
ardent
grateful
half
laughing
half
in
tears
lorance
lorance
étienne
murmured
tremulously
she
said
i
should
kiss
you
i
put
my
fingers
in
my
ears
and
then
took
them
out
again
for
if
my
ears
were
sealed
how
was
i
to
hear
mme
de
nemours
approaching
but
i
admit
i
should
have
kept
my
eyes
glued
to
the
crack
of
the
door
that
i
ever
turned
them
is
my
shame
i
have
no
business
to
know
that
mademoiselle
bowed
her
face
upon
her
lover
shoulder
her
hand
clasping
his
neck
silent
motionless
he
pressed
his
cheek
against
her
hair
holding
her
close
neither
had
any
will
to
move
or
speak
it
seemed
they
were
well
content
to
stand
so
the
rest
of
their
lives
mademoiselle
was
the
first
to
stir
she
raised
her
head
and
strove
to
break
away
from
his
locked
arms
monsieur
monsieur
this
is
madness
you
must
go
are
you
sorry
i
came
he
demanded
vibrantly
are
you
sorry
lorance
his
eyes
held
hers
she
threw
pretence
to
the
winds
no
monsieur
i
am
glad
for
if
we
never
meet
again
we
have
had
this
aye
if
i
die
i
have
had
their
voices
were
like
the
rune
of
the
heart
of
the
forest
like
the
music
of
deep
streams
i
turned
away
my
head
ashamed
and
strove
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
waking
of
mme
de
nemours
i
thought
you
dead
she
moaned
her
voice
muffled
against
his
cheek
no
one
would
tell
me
what
happened
last
night
i
could
not
devise
any
way
of
escape
for
you
there
is
a
tunnel
from
ferou
house
to
the
rue
de
la
soierie
his
mother
merciful
angel
let
me
through
and
you
were
not
hurt
not
a
scratch
ma
mie
but
the
wound
before
félix
said
i
was
put
out
of
combat
the
night
i
got
it
he
explained
earnestly
troubled
even
now
because
he
had
not
obeyed
her
summons
i
was
dizzy
i
could
not
walk
but
now
monsieur
does
it
heal
it
is
well
almost
was
but
a
slash
on
the
arm
oh
then
have
i
no
anxiety
she
murmured
with
a
smile
that
twinkled
across
her
lips
and
was
gone
i
can
not
perceive
you
to
be
disabled
monsieur
my
sweeting
he
laughed
out
if
i
can
not
hold
a
sword
yet
i
can
hold
my
love
but
you
must
not
monsieur
she
cried
fear
that
had
slept
a
moment
springing
on
her
again
you
must
go
and
this
instant
while
the
others
are
yet
away
i
knew
you
blanche
knew
you
some
other
will
oh
go
go
i
implore
you
if
you
will
come
with
me
she
made
no
answer
save
to
look
at
him
as
at
a
madman
nay
i
mean
not
now
past
the
sentry
i
am
not
so
crazy
as
that
but
you
will
slip
out
you
will
find
a
way
and
come
to
me
silently
sadly
she
shook
her
head
his
arms
loosened
and
she
freed
herself
from
him
but
instantly
he
was
close
on
her
again
but
you
must
you
will
you
must
ah
lorance
my
father
is
won
over
he
bids
me
win
you
he
has
sworn
to
welcome
you
when
he
sees
you
he
will
be
your
slave
but
my
cousin
mayenne
is
not
won
over
devil
fly
away
with
your
cousin
mayenne
étienne
retorted
with
a
vehemence
that
made
me
shudder
lest
the
walls
have
ears
ah
you
are
free
to
say
that
monsieur
but
i
am
not
i
am
of
his
blood
and
dwell
in
his
house
and
eat
at
his
board
he
was
looking
at
her
with
a
passionate
ardour
grasping
her
actual
words
less
than
their
import
of
refusal
are
you
afraid
he
cried
are
you
frightened
of
mine

need
not
be
mignonne

can
contrive
to
slip
from
the
house

de

help
you

in
the
street

will
meet
you

will
carry
you
home
to
hold
you
against
all
the
world

is
not
that
she
answered

your
fear
he
cried
quickly
ah

lorance

not
i
love
you
as
i
love
the
queen
of
heaven
ah
hush
as
i
love
the
queen
of
heaven
i
will
as
soon
do
sacrilege
toward
her
as
ill
to
you
he
dropped
on
his
knees
before
her
kissing
the
hem
of
her
gown
she
stood
looking
down
on
his
bowed
head
with
a
tenderness
that
seemed
to
infold
him
as
with
a
mantle
he
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
still
kneeling
at
her
feet
lorance
will
you
come
with
me
she
was
silent
a
moment
with
heaving
breast
and
face
monsieur
i
am
sworn
that
night
when
félix
came
when
i
was
in
deadly
terror
for
him
and
for
you
étienne
i
promised
my
lord
an
he
would
lift
his
hand
from
you
to
obey
him
in
all
things
he
bade
me
never
again
to
hold
intercourse
with
you
alack
i
am
already
forsworn
but
i
can
not
he
leaped
to
his
feet
crying
out
lorance
he
was
the
first
forsworn
for
he
did
move
against

he
told
you
the
warning
went
through
félix
that
if
you
tried
to
reach
me
he
would
crush
you
as
a
buzzing
fly

implored

turned
from

her
hands

not
kept

broken
his
oath

my
warning

provoked
but
yesterday
in
the
afternoon

the
attempt
to
see

sent
to
arrest

the
murder

the
lackey
pontou

in
white
surprise

spoke
of
it

heard
félix
and
i
what
monsieur
sent
to

but

mistake
paul
de
lorraine
he
was
not
here
last
night
she
cried
mayenne
was
demanding
him
of
me
then
he
slept
pleasantly
in
the
bastille
may

the
outside
of
its
walls
again
but
he
will
he
does

this
time

tranquil
breath

dangers

i
run
in
the
face
of
my
peril
ah
monsieur
perhaps
your
life
is
nothing
to
you
but
it
is
more
to
me
than
tongue
can
tell
my
love
my
love
he
snatched
her
into
his
arms
she
held
away
from
him
to
look
him
beseechingly
in
the
face
her
little
clutching
hands
on
his
shoulders
oh
you
will
go
you
will
go
only
if
you
come
with
me
lorance
it
is
such
a
little
way
only
to
meet
me
in
the
next
square
we
will
slip
out
of
the
gates
together
leave
paris
and
all
its
plots
and
murders
and
at
denis
keep
our
honeymoon
monsieur
she
said
slowly
i
am
told
that
my
cousin
mayenne
offered
a
month
ago
to
give
me
to
you
for
your
name
on
the
roster
of
the
league
is
that
true
it
is
true
but
you
can
not
think
lorance
it
was
for
any
lack
of
love
for
you
i
swear
to
you
nay
you
need
not
i
have
it
by
heart
that
you
love
me
lorance
but
when
you
could
not
take
me
with
honour
you
would
not
take
me
your
house
stands
against
us
you
would
not
desert
your
house
am
i
then
to
be
false
to
mine
a
woman
belongs
to
her
husband
house
aye
but
she
does
not
wed
the
enemy
of
her
own
monsieur
you
are
full
of
loyalty
shall
i
have
none
i
was
born
my
father
before
me
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
of
lorraine
the
lorraine
princes
our
kinsmen
our
masters
our
friends
when
i
was
orphaned
young
and
penniless
because
king
henry
huguenots
had
wrenched
our
lands
away
i
came
here
to
my
cousin
mayenne
to
dwell
here
in
kindness
and
love
as
a
daughter
of
the
house
am
i
to
turn
traitor
now
lorance
he
was
fiercely
beginning
when
mlle
de
tavanne
bounded
in
on
guard
she
hissed
at
us
they
come
she
looked
behind
her
into
the
corridor
mademoiselle
gave
her
lips
to
monsieur
in
one
last
kiss
and
slipped
like
water
from
his
arms
i
was
at
his
side
and
we
busied
ourselves
over
the
trinkets
he
with
shaking
fingers
cheeks
burning
through
the
stain
the
ladies
streamed
into
the
room
the
lovely
mme
de
montpensier
alone
conspicuous
by
her
absence
mme
de
mayenne
face
was
hot
and
angry
and
bore
marks
of
tears
not
in
this
room
only
had
a
combat
raged
never
shall
he
come
into
this
house
again
madame
was
crying
vigorously
i
had
had
him
strangled
the
vile
little
beast
an
she
had
not
seized
him
i
will
now
if
she
ever
dares
bring
him
hither
again
you
certainly
should
madame
replied
the
nearest
of
the
ladies
you
have
been
in
the
goodness
of
your
heart
far
too
forbearing
too
patient
under
many
presumptions
one
would
suppose
the
mistress
here
to
be
mme
de
montpensier
i
will
show
who
is
mistress
here
the
duchesse
de
mayenne
retorted
then
her
eye
fell
on
mlle
de
montluc
making
her
way
softly
to
the
door
and
the
vials
of
her
wrath
overflowed
upon
her
what
lorance
you
could
not
be
at
the
pains
to
follow
me
to
the
rescue
of
my
child
your
little
cousin
poor
innocent
may
be
eaten
by
the
beasts
for
aught
you
care
while
you
prink
over
trinkets
mademoiselle
faced
her
blankly
scarce
understanding
midst
the
whirl
of
her
own
thoughts
of
what
she
was
accused
the
little
tavanne
came
gallantly
to
the
rescue
i
did
not
follow
you
either
madame
we
thought
it
scarcely
safe
lorance
could
not
bear
to
leave
this
fellow
alone
mme
de
mayenne
glanced
instinctively
at
her
rich
accoutrements
touched
in
spite
of
herself
by
such
care
of
her
belongings
i
had
not
suspected
you
maids
of
such
she
said
with
relenting
i
vow
for
once
i
am
beholden
to
you
you
did
quite
right
lorance
xxvi
the
spider
mademoiselle
slipped
softly
out
of
the
room
taking
our
hearts
with
her
our
one
desire
now
was
to
be
gone
but
it
was
easier
wished
than
accomplished
for
there
remained
the
dreary
process
of
bargaining
mme
de
mayenne
had
set
her
heart
on
a
pearl
bracelet
mme
de
brie
wanted
a
vinaigrette
a
third
lady
a
pair
of
étienne
developed
a
recklessness
about
prices
that
would
have
whitened
the
hair
of
a
goldsmith
father
i
thought
the
ladies
could
not
fail
to
be
suspicious
of
such
prodigality
to
imagine
we
carried
stolen
goods
but
no
the
quick
settlements
defeated
their
own
ends
they
fired
our
customers
with
longing
to
purchase
further
i
was
despairing
when
at
length
mme
de
mayenne
bethought
herself
that
was
at
hand
and
that
no
one
was
yet
dressed
to
my
eyes
the
company
already
looked
fine
enough
for
a
coronation
but
i
rejoiced
to
hear
them
thanking
madame
for
her
reminder
with
the
gratitude
of
victims
snatched
from
an
awful
fate
we
were
commanded
to
bundle
out
which
with
all
alacrity
we
did
freedom
was
in
sight
i
was
not
so
nervous
on
this
journey
as
i
had
been
coming
in
as
we
passed
through
the
long
corridors
i
had
ease
enough
of
mind
to
enable
me
to
take
my
bearings
and
to
whisper
to
my
master
that
door
yonder
is
the
door
of
the
where
i
was
even
as
i
spoke
the
door
opened
two
gentlemen
appearing
at
the
threshold
one
was
a
stranger
the
other
was
mayenne
our
guide
held
back
in
deference
the
duke
and
his
friend
stood
a
moment
or
two
in
converse
then
the
visitor
made
his
farewells
and
went
off
down
the
staircase
mayenne
had
not
appeared
aware
of
our
existence
thirty
feet
up
the
passage
but
now
he
inquired
as
if
we
had
been
pieces
of
merchandise
what
have
you
there
louis
an
italian
goldsmith
so
please
your
grace
madame
has
just
dismissed
him
he
led
us
forward
mayenne
surveyed
us
deliberately
and
at
length
said
to
le
comte
i
will
look
at
your
wares
étienne
smiled
his
eager
deprecating
smile
informing
his
highness
that
we
poor
creatures
spoke
no
french
how
came
you
in
paris
then
étienne
for
the
fourth
time
went
through
with
his
tale
i
think
this
time
he
must
have
trembled
over
it
my
lord
mayenne
had
not
the
reputation
of
being
easily
gulled
for
aught
we
knew
he
might
be
informed
of
the
name
and
condition
of
every
person
who
had
entered
paris
this
year
he
might
as
he
listened
be
checking
off
to
himself
the
number
of
monsieur
lies
but
if
étienne
trembled
in
his
soul
his
words
never
faltered
he
knew
his
history
well
by
this
at
its
finish
mayenne
said
come
in
here
the
lackey
was
ordered
to
wait
outside
while
we
followed
his
grace
of
mayenne
across
the
to
that
table
by
the
window
where
he
had
sat
with
lucas
night
before
last
i
clinched
my
teeth
to
keep
them
from
chattering
together
not
grammont
brutality
not
lucas
venom
not
mlle
de
tavanne
rampant
suspicion
had
ever
frightened
me
so
horribly
as
did
mayenne
amiable
composure
he
made
me
feel
as
i
had
felt
when
i
entered
the
tunnel
helpless
in
the
dark
unable
to
cope
with
dangers
i
could
not
see
mayenne
was
a
well
the
light
shining
down
its
sides
a
way
and
far
below
the
still
surface
of
the
water
you
hang
over
the
edge
and
peer
till
your
eyes
drop
out
you
can
as
easily
look
through
iron
as
discern
how
deep
the
water
is
i
seemed
to
see
clearly
that
mayenne
suspected
us
not
in
the
least
he
was
as
placid
as
a
summer
day
turning
over
the
contents
of
the
box
showing
little
interest
in
us
much
in
our
wares
every
now
and
then
speaking
a
generous
word
of
praise
or
asking
a
friendly
question
he
was
the
very
model
of
the
gracious
prince
the
humble
tradesmen
whom
we
feigned
to
be
must
needs
have
worshipfully
loved
him
yet
withal
i
believed
that
all
the
time
he
knew
us
that
he
was
amusing
himself
with
us
presently
when
he
tired
he
would
walk
casually
out
of
the
room
and
send
in
his
creatures
to
stab
us
had
i
known
this
for
a
truth
that
he
had
discovered
us
i
should
have
braced
myself
i
trow
to
meet
it
the
certainty
would
have
been
bearable
i
had
courage
to
face
ruin
it
was
the
uncertainty
that
was
so
like
crossing
a
morass
in
the
dark
we
might
be
on
the
safe
path
we
might
with
every
step
be
wandering
away
farther
and
farther
into
the
treacherous
bog
there
was
no
way
to
tell
mayenne
was
quite
the
man
to
be
kindly
patron
of
the
crafts
to
pick
out
a
rich
present
for
a
friend
he
was
also
the
man
to
sit
in
the
presence
of
his
enemy
unbetraying
tranquil
assured
waiting
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
a
few
minutes
more
of
this
i
should
go
mad
i
should
scream
out
yes
i
am
félix
broux
and
he
is
le
comte
de
mar
but
before
i
had
verily
come
to
this
something
happened
to
change
the
situation
entered
like
a
young
tempest
slamming
the
door
after
him
lucas
étienne
clutched
me
by
the
arm
drawing
me
back
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
where
we
stood
in
plain
sight
but
with
our
faces
blotted
out
against
the
light
mayenne
looked
up
from
two
rings
he
was
comparing
one
in
each
hand
lucas
hat
on
head
came
rapidly
across
the
room
so
you
have
appeared
again
mayenne
said
i
could
almost
believe
myself
back
in
night
before
last
aye
at
last
i
have
lucas
was
all
hot
and
ruffled
panting
half
from
hurry
half
from
wrath
you
saw
fit
to
be
absent
last
night
mayenne
went
on
indifferently
his
eyes
on
the
ring
i
trust
for
your
sake
you
have
used
your
time
profitably
i
have
been
about
my
own
concerns
lucas
answered
lightly
arming
himself
with
his
insolence
against
the
other
disdain
in
a
moment
he
had
mastered
the
excitement
that
brought
him
so
stormily
into
the
room
he
was
once
more
the
lucas
who
had
entered
that
other
night
nonchalant
mocking
pretty
trinkets
he
observed
sitting
down
and
lifting
a
bracelet
from
the
tray
the
close
kinship
of
these
men
betrayed
itself
in
nothing
so
sharply
as
in
their
unerring
instinct
for
annoying
each
other
had
lucas
volunteered
explanation
for
his
absence
mayenne
would
not
have
listened
to
it
but
as
he
withheld
it
the
duke
demanded
brusquely
well
do
you
give
an
account
of
yourself
you
had
better
lucas
repeated
the
tactics
which
he
had
found
such
good
entertainment
before
he
looked
with
raised
eyebrows
toward
us
you
would
not
have
me
speak
before
these
vermin
uncle
these
vermin
understand
no
french
mayenne
made
answer
but
do
as
it
likes
you
it
is
nothing
to
me
my
master
pinched
my
hand
mayenne
did
not
know
us
after
all
he
was
what
étienne
had
called
him
a
man
neither
god
nor
devil
he
could
make
mistakes
like
the
rest
of
us
for
once
he
had
been
caught
napping
lucas
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
a
meditative
air
as
if
idly
wondering
whether
to
speak
or
not
in
his
place
i
should
not
have
wondered
one
moment
had
mayenne
assured
me
in
that
quiet
tone
that
he
cared
nothing
whether
i
spoke
i
should
scarce
have
been
able
to
utter
my
words
fast
enough
but
there
was
so
strange
a
twist
in
lucas
nature
that
he
must
sometimes
thwart
his
own
interests
value
his
caprice
above
his
prosperity
also
in
this
case
his
story
was
no
triumphant
one
but
at
length
he
did
begin
it
i
went
to
belin
to
inform
him
that
day
before
yesterday
étienne
de
mar
murdered
his
lackey
pontou
in
mar
house
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
was
that
your
errand
mayenne
said
looking
up
in
slow
surprise
my
faith
your
oaths
to
lorance
trouble
you
little
lucas
started
forward
sharply
do
you
tell
me
you
did
not
know
my
purpose
i
knew
of
course
that
you
were
up
to
some
warlockry
mayenne
answered
i
did
not
concern
myself
to
discover
what
there
speaks
the
general
there
speaks
the
gentleman
lucas
cried
out
a
general
hangs
a
spy
yet
he
profits
by
spying
the
spy
runs
the
risks
incurs
the
shames
the
general
sits
in
his
tent
his
honour
untarnished
pocketing
all
the
glory
faugh
you
gentlemen
you
will
not
do
dirty
work
but
you
will
have
it
done
for
you
you
sit
at
home
with
clean
hands
and
eyes
that
see
not
while
we
go
forth
to
serve
you
you
are
the
duke
of
mayenne
i
am
your
bastard
nephew
living
on
your
favour
but
you
go
too
far
when
you
sneer
at
my
smirches
he
was
on
his
feet
standing
over
mayenne
his
face
blazing
étienne
made
an
instinctive
step
forward
thinking
him
about
to
knife
the
duke
but
mayenne
as
we
well
knew
was
no
craven
be
a
little
quieter
paul
he
said
unmoved
you
will
have
the
guard
in
in
a
moment
lucas
held
absolutely
still
for
a
second
so
did
mayenne
he
knew
that
lucas
standing
could
stab
quicker
than
he
defend
he
sat
there
with
both
hands
on
the
table
looking
composedly
up
at
his
nephew
lucas
flung
away
across
the
room
i
shall
have
dismissed
these
people
directly
mayenne
continued
then
you
can
tell
me
your
tale
i
can
tell
it
now
in
two
words
lucas
answered
coming
abruptly
back
belin
signed
the
warrant
and
sent
a
young
ass
of
the
burgher
guard
after
mar
i
attended
to
some
affairs
of
my
own
then
after
a
time
i
went
round
to
the
trois
lanternes
to
see
if
they
had
got
him
he
was
not
there
only
that
cub
of
a
boy
of
his
when
i
came
in
he
swore
the
innkeeper
swore
the
whole
crew
swore
i
was
mar
the
fool
of
an
officer
arrested
me
i
expected
mayenne
to
burst
out
laughing
in
lucas
chagrined
face
but
instead
he
seemed
less
struck
with
his
nephew
misfortunes
than
with
some
other
aspect
of
the
affair
he
said
slowly
you
told
belin
this
arrest
was
my
desire
i
may
have
implied
something
of
the
sort
you
repeated
it
to
the
arresting
officer
before
mar
boy
i
had
no
time
to
say
anything
before
they
hustled
me
off
lucas
exclaimed
mille
tonnerres
never
had
any
man
such
luck
as
i
enough
to
make
me
sign
papers
with
the
devil
mar
would
believe
i
had
broken
faith
with
him
i
dare
say
one
is
responsible
for
what
mar
believes
lucas
answered
carelessly
mayenne
was
silent
with
knit
brows
drumming
his
hand
on
the
table
lucas
went
on
with
the
tale
of
his
woes
at
the
bastille
i
ordered
the
commissary
to
send
to
you
he
did
not
he
sent
to
belin
belin
was
busy
did
understand
the
message
would
be
bothered
i
lay
in
my
cell
like
a
mouse
in
a
trap
till
an
hour
agone
when
at
last
he
saw
fit
to
appear
damn
him
mayenne
fell
to
laughing
lucas
cried
out
when
they
arrested
me
my
first
thought
was
that
this
was
your
work
in
that
case
how
should
you
be
free
now
you
found
you
needed
me
you
are
twice
wrong
paul
for
i
knew
nothing
of
your
arrest
nor
do
i
think
i
need
you
pardieu
you
succeed
too
badly
to
give
me
confidence
lucas
stood
glowering
gnawing
his
lip
picturing
the
chagrin
the
angry
reproaches
the
justifications
he
did
not
utter
i
am
certain
he
pitied
himself
as
the
sport
of
fate
and
of
tyrants
the
most
shamefully
used
of
mortal
men
and
so
long
as
he
aspired
to
the
hand
of
mayenne
ward
so
long
was
he
helpless
under
mayenne
will
was
pity
mayenne
said
reflectively
that
you
thought
best
to
be
absent
last
night
had
you
been
here
you
had
had
sport
your
young
friend
mar
came
to
sing
under
his
lady
window
saw
she
him
lucas
cried
sharply
how
should
i
know
she
does
not
confide
in
me
you
took
care
to
find
out
lucas
cried
knowing
he
was
being
badgered
yet
powerless
to
keep
himself
from
writhing
i
may
have
did
she
see
him
lucas
demanded
again
the
heavy
lines
of
hatred
and
jealousy
searing
his
face
no
credit
to
you
if
she
did
not
you
accomplish
singularly
little
to
harass
de
mar
in
his
you
deserve
that
she
should
have
seen
him
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
did
not
she
was
in
the
chapel
with
madame
what
happened
françois
de
brie
now
there
is
a
youngster
paul
mayenne
interrupted
himself
to
point
out
who
has
not
a
tithe
of
your
cleverness
but
he
has
the
advantage
of
being
on
the
spot
when
needed
desiring
a
word
with
mademoiselle
he
betook
himself
to
her
chamber
she
was
not
there
but
mar
was
warbling
under
the
window
brie
brie
bestirred
himself
he
sent
two
of
the
guard
round
behind
the
house
to
cut
off
the
retreat
while
he
and
latour
attacked
from
the
front
mar
killed
lucas
cried
he
killed
by
no
means
answered
mayenne
he
got
away
before
he
could
explain
further
if
he
meant
to
the
door
opened
and
mlle
de
montluc
came
in
her
eyes
travelled
first
to
us
in
anxiety
then
with
relief
to
mayenne
sitting
over
the
jewels
last
to
lucas
with
startlement
she
advanced
without
hesitation
to
the
duke
i
am
come
monsieur
to
fetch
you
to
supper
pardieu
lorance
mayenne
exclaimed
you
show
me
a
different
face
from
that
of
indeed
so
she
did
for
her
eyes
were
shining
with
excitement
while
the
colour
that
étienne
had
kissed
into
them
still
flushed
her
cheeks
if
i
do
she
made
quick
answer
it
is
because
the
more
i
think
on
it
the
surer
i
grow
that
my
loving
cousin
will
not
break
my
heart
i
want
a
word
with
you
lorance
mayenne
said
quietly
as
many
as
you
like
monsieur
she
replied
promptly
but
will
you
not
send
these
creatures
from
the
room
first
do
you
include
your
cousin
paul
in
that
term
i
meant
these
jewellers
but
since
you
suggest
it
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
for
paul
to
go
you
hear
your
orders
paul
aye
i
hear
and
i
disobey
lucas
retorted
mademoiselle
i
take
too
much
joy
in
your
presence
to
be
willing
to
leave
it
monsieur
she
said
to
the
duke
ignoring
her
cousin
paul
with
a
coolness
that
must
have
maddened
him
will
you
not
dismiss
your
tradespeople
then
can
we
talk
comfortably
aye
answered
mayenne
i
will
i
am
more
gallant
than
paul
if
you
command
it
out
they
go
though
i
have
not
half
had
time
to
look
their
wares
over
here
master
jeweller
he
addressed
étienne
slipping
easily
into
italian
pack
up
your
wares
and
depart
étienne
bursting
into
rapid
thanks
to
his
highness
for
his
condescension
in
noticing
the
dirt
of
the
way
set
about
his
packing
mayenne
turned
to
his
lovely
cousin
now
for
my
word
to
you
mademoiselle
you
wept
so
last
night
it
was
impossible
to
discuss
the
subject
properly
but
now
i
rejoice
to
see
you
more
tranquil
here
is
the
beginning
and
the
middle
and
the
end
of
the
matter
your
marriage
is
my
affair
and
i
shall
do
as
i
like
about
it
she
searched
his
face
before
his
steady
look
her
colour
slowly
died
étienne
whether
by
accident
or
design
knocked
his
tray
of
jewels
off
the
table
murmuring
profuse
apologies
he
dropped
on
his
knees
to
grope
for
them
neither
of
the
men
heeded
him
but
kept
their
eyes
steadily
on
the
lady
mademoiselle
mayenne
deliberately
went
on
i
have
been
with
you
had
i
followed
my
own
interests
instead
of
bowing
to
your
whims
you
had
been
a
wife
these
two
years
i
have
indulged
you
mademoiselle
because
you
were
my
ally
montluc
daughter
because
you
came
to
me
a
lonely
orphan
because
you
were
my
little
cousin
whose
baby
mouth
i
kissed
i
have
let
you
cavil
at
this
suitor
and
that
pout
that
one
was
too
tall
and
one
too
short
and
a
third
too
bold
and
a
fourth
not
bold
enough
i
have
been
pleased
to
let
you
cajole
me
but
now
mademoiselle
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
patience
monsieur
she
cried
i
never
meant
to
abuse
your
kindness
you
let
me
cajole
you
as
you
say
else
i
could
not
have
done
it
you
treated
my
whims
as
a
jest
you
let
me
air
them
but
when
you
frowned
i
have
put
them
by
i
have
always
done
your
will
then
do
it
now
mademoiselle
be
faithful
to
me
and
to
your
birth
cease
sighing
for
the
enemy
of
our
house
monsieur
she
said
when
you
first
brought
him
to
me
he
was
not
the
enemy
of
our
house
when
he
came
here
day
after
day
season
after
season
he
was
not
our
enemy
when
i
wrote
that
letter
at
dictation
i
did
not
know
he
was
our
enemy
you
told
me
that
night
that
i
was
not
for
him
i
promised
you
obedience
did
he
come
here
to
me
and
implore
me
to
wed
with
him
i
would
send
him
away
mayenne
little
imagined
how
truly
she
spoke
but
he
could
not
look
in
her
eyes
and
doubt
her
honesty
you
are
a
good
child
lorance
he
said
i
could
wish
your
lover
as
docile
he
will
not
come
here
again
she
cried
he
knows
i
am
not
for
him
he
gives
it
up
monsieur
he
takes
himself
out
of
paris
i
promise
you
it
is
over
he
gives
me
up
i
have
not
his
promise
for
that
mayenne
said
dryly
but
the
next
time
he
comes
after
you
he
may
settle
with
your
husband
she
uttered
a
little
gasp
but
scarce
of
surprise
almost
of
relief
that
the
blow
so
long
expected
had
at
last
been
dealt
you
will
marry
me
monsieur
she
murmured
to
de
brie
you
are
shrewd
mademoiselle
you
know
that
it
will
be
a
good
three
months
before
françois
de
brie
can
stand
up
to
be
you
say
to
yourself
that
much
may
happen
in
three
months
so
it
may
therefore
will
your
bridegroom
be
at
hand
morning
she
made
no
rejoinder
but
her
eyes
wide
like
a
hunted
animal
moved
fearsomely
loathingly
to
lucas
mayenne
uttered
an
abrupt
laugh
no
paul
is
not
the
happy
man
besides
bungling
the
quentin
affair
he
has
seen
fit
to
make
free
with
my
name
in
an
enterprise
of
his
own
therefore
paul
you
will
dance
at
lorance
wedding
a
bachelor
mademoiselle
you
marry
in
the
morning
señor
el
conde
del
rondelar
y
saragossa
of
his
majesty
king
philip
court
after
dinner
you
will
depart
with
your
husband
for
spain
lucas
sprang
forward
hand
on
sword
face
ablaze
with
furious
protest
mayenne
heeding
him
no
more
than
if
he
had
not
been
there
rose
and
went
to
mlle
de
montluc
have
i
your
obedience
cousin
you
know
it
monsieur
she
was
curtseying
to
him
when
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
kissing
both
her
cheeks
you
are
as
good
as
you
are
lovely
and
that
says
much
ma
mie
we
will
talk
a
little
more
about
this
after
supper
permit
me
mademoiselle
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
in
leisurely
fashion
out
of
the
room
it
wondered
me
that
lucas
had
not
killed
him
he
looked
murder
haply
had
the
duke
disclosed
by
so
much
as
a
quivering
eyelid
a
consciousness
of
lucas
rage
of
danger
to
himself
lucas
had
struck
him
down
but
he
walked
straight
past
clad
in
his
composure
as
in
armour
and
lucas
made
no
move
i
think
to
stab
was
the
impulse
of
a
moment
gone
in
a
moment
instantly
he
was
glad
he
had
not
killed
the
duke
of
mayenne
to
be
cut
himself
into
dice
by
the
guard
after
the
duke
was
gone
lucas
stood
still
a
long
time
no
less
furious
but
cogitating
deeply
we
had
gathered
up
our
jewels
and
locked
our
box
and
stood
holding
it
between
us
waiting
our
chance
to
depart
we
might
have
gone
a
dozen
times
during
the
talking
for
none
marked
us
but
étienne
despite
my
tuggings
refused
to
budge
so
long
as
mademoiselle
was
in
the
room
now
was
he
ready
enough
to
go
but
hesitated
to
see
if
lucas
would
not
leave
first
that
worthy
however
showed
no
intention
of
stirring
but
remained
in
his
pose
buried
in
thought
unaware
of
our
presence
to
get
out
we
had
to
walk
round
one
end
or
the
other
of
the
table
passing
either
before
or
behind
him
le
comte
was
for
marching
carelessly
before
his
face
but
i
pulled
so
violently
in
the
other
direction
that
he
gave
way
to
me
i
think
now
that
had
we
passed
in
front
of
him
lucas
would
have
let
us
go
by
without
a
look
as
it
was
hearing
steps
at
his
back
he
wheeled
about
to
confront
us
if
the
eye
of
love
is
quick
so
is
the
eye
of
hate
he
cried
out
instantly
mar
we
dropped
the
box
and
sprang
at
him
but
he
was
too
quick
for
us
he
leaped
back
whipping
out
his
sword
i
have
you
now
mar
he
cried
étienne
grabbed
up
the
heavy
box
in
both
hands
to
brain
him
lucas
retreated
he
might
run
through
étienne
but
only
at
the
risk
of
having
his
head
split
after
all
it
suited
his
book
as
well
to
take
us
alive
shouting
for
the
guards
he
retreated
toward
the
door
but
i
was
there
before
him
as
he
ran
at
étienne
i
had
dashed
by
slammed
the
door
shut
and
bolted
it
if
we
were
caught
we
would
make
a
fight
for
it
i
snatched
up
a
stool
for
weapon
he
halted
then
he
darted
over
to
the
chimney
and
pulled
violently
the
hanging
near
we
heard
through
the
closed
door
two
loud
peals
somewhere
in
the
corridor
we
both
ran
for
him
even
as
he
pulled
the
rope
étienne
struck
the
box
over
his
sword
snapping
it
i
dropped
my
stool
as
he
his
box
and
we
pinned
lucas
in
our
arms
the
oratory
i
gasped
with
a
strength
born
of
our
desperation
we
dragged
him
kicking
and
cursing
across
the
room
heaved
him
with
all
our
force
into
the
oratory
and
bolted
the
door
on
him
your
wig
cried
étienne
running
to
recover
his
box
while
i
picked
it
up
and
endeavoured
with
clumsy
fingers
to
put
it
on
properly
he
set
on
its
legs
the
stool
i
had
flung
down
threw
the
pieces
of
sword
into
the
fireplace
seized
his
box
dashed
to
me
and
set
my
wig
straight
dashed
to
the
outer
door
and
opened
it
just
as
pierre
came
up
the
corridor
well
what
do
you
want
the
lackey
demanded
you
ring
as
if
it
was
a
question
of
life
and
death
i
want
to
be
shown
out
if
the
messer
will
be
so
kind
his
highness
the
duke
when
he
went
to
supper
left
me
here
to
put
up
my
wares
but
i
know
not
my
way
to
the
door
it
was
after
sunset
and
the
room
back
from
the
windows
was
dusky
the
lackey
seemed
not
to
mark
our
flushed
and
rumpled
looks
and
to
be
quite
satisfied
with
étienne
explanation
when
of
a
sudden
lucas
who
had
been
stunned
for
the
moment
by
the
violent
meeting
of
his
head
and
the
tiles
began
to
pound
and
kick
on
the
oratory
door
he
was
shouting
as
well
but
the
door
closed
with
absolute
tightness
it
had
not
even
a
keyhole
his
cries
came
to
us
muffled
and
inarticulate
corpo
di
bacco
étienne
exclaimed
with
a
face
of
childlike
surprise
some
one
is
in
a
fine
hurry
to
enter
do
you
not
let
him
in
sir
master
of
the
household
i
wonder
who
he
got
there
now
pierre
muttered
to
himself
in
french
staring
in
puzzled
wise
at
the
door
then
he
answered
étienne
with
a
laugh
no
my
innocent
i
do
not
let
him
in
it
might
cost
me
my
neck
to
open
that
door
come
along
now
i
must
see
you
out
and
get
back
to
my
trenchers
we
met
not
a
soul
on
the
stairs
every
one
served
or
servants
being
in
the
we
passed
the
sentry
without
question
and
round
the
corner
without
hindrance
étienne
stopped
to
heave
a
sigh
of
thanksgiving
i
thought
we
were
done
for
that
time
he
panted
mordieu
another
scored
off
lucas
come
let
us
make
good
time
home
wise
to
be
inside
our
gates
when
he
gets
out
of
that
closet
we
made
good
time
ever
listening
for
the
haro
after
us
but
we
heard
it
not
we
came
unmolested
up
the
street
at
the
back
of
the
hôtel
quentin
on
our
way
to
the
postern
monsieur
took
the
key
out
of
his
doublet
saying
as
we
walked
around
the
corner
tower
well
it
appears
we
are
safe
at
home
yes
m
étienne
even
as
i
uttered
the
words
three
men
from
the
shadow
of
the
wall
sprang
out
and
seized
us
this
is
he
one
cried
le
comte
de
mar
i
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
to
the
bastille
xxvii
instantly
two
more
men
came
running
from
the
postern
arch
the
five
were
upon
us
like
an
avalanche
one
pinned
my
arms
while
another
gagged
me
two
held
étienne
a
third
stopping
his
mouth
prettily
done
quoth
the
leader
not
a
squeal
morbleu
i
anxious
to
have
old
vigo
out
disputing
my
rights
étienne
wrists
were
neatly
trussed
by
this
time
at
a
word
from
the
leader
our
captors
turned
us
about
and
marched
us
up
the
lane
by
mirabeau
garden
where
bernet
blood
lay
rusty
on
the
stones
we
offered
no
resistance
whatever
we
should
only
have
been
prodded
with
a
for
our
pains
i
made
out
despite
the
thickening
twilight
the
familiar
uniform
of
the
burgher
guard
de
belin
having
bagged
the
wrong
bird
once
had
now
caught
the
right
one
the
captain
bade
one
of
the
fellows
go
call
the
others
off
i
could
guess
that
the
job
had
been
done
thoroughly
every
approach
to
the
house
guarded
i
gnashed
my
teeth
over
the
gag
that
i
had
not
suspected
the
danger
the
truth
was
both
of
us
had
our
heads
so
full
of
mademoiselle
of
mayenne
and
of
lucas
that
we
had
forgotten
the
governor
and
his
preposterous
warrant
they
led
us
into
the
rue
de
where
was
waiting
the
same
black
coach
that
had
stood
before
the
oie
the
same
louis
on
the
box
its
lamps
were
lighted
by
their
glimmer
our
captors
for
the
first
time
saw
us
fairly
why
captain
cried
the
man
at
étienne
elbow
this
is
no
comte
de
mar
the
comte
de
mar
is
i
seen
him
scores
of
times
the
comte
de
mar
answers
to
the
name
of
étienne
and
so
does
this
fellow
the
captain
answered
he
took
the
candle
from
one
of
the
lamps
and
held
it
in
étienne
face
then
he
put
out
a
sudden
hand
and
pulled
the
wig
off
good
for
you
captain
cried
the
men
we
were
indeed
unfortunate
to
encounter
an
officer
with
brains
we
take
your
gag
off
too
le
comte
in
the
coach
the
captain
told
him
will
you
bring
the
lass
along
captain
not
exactly
the
leader
laughed
a
fine
prison
it
would
be
could
a
felon
have
his
bonnibel
at
his
side
no
i
leave
the
maid
but
she
need
give
the
alarm
yet
do
you
stay
awhile
with
her
you
not
mind
the
job
keep
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
let
her
go
her
ways
they
bundled
my
lord
into
the
coach
box
and
all
the
captain
and
two
men
with
him
the
fourth
clambered
up
beside
louis
as
he
cracked
his
whip
and
rattled
smartly
down
the
street
my
guardian
stole
a
loving
arm
around
my
waist
and
marched
me
down
the
quiet
lane
between
the
garden
walls
he
was
clutching
my
right
wrist
but
my
left
hand
was
free
and
i
fumbled
at
my
gag
in
the
middle
of
the
deserted
lane
he
halted
now
my
beauty
if
you
be
good
i
take
that
stopper
off
but
if
you
make
a
scream
by
heaven
it
be
your
last
i
shook
my
head
and
squeezed
his
hand
imploringly
while
he
holding
me
tight
in
one
sinewy
arm
plucked
at
the
knot
i
waited
meek
as
griselda
till
the
gag
was
off
and
then
i
let
him
have
it
volleying
curses
i
hammered
him
square
in
the
eye
it
was
a
mad
course
for
he
was
armed
i
not
but
instead
of
stabbing
he
dropped
me
like
a
hot
coal
gasping
in
the
blankest
consternation
thousand
devils
it
a
boy
a
second
later
when
he
recollected
himself
i
was
tearing
down
the
lane
i
am
a
good
runner
and
then
any
one
can
run
well
when
he
runs
for
his
life
despite
the
wretched
kirtle
tying
up
my
legs
i
gained
on
him
and
when
i
had
reached
the
corner
of
our
house
he
dropped
the
pursuit
and
made
off
in
the
darkness
i
ran
full
tilt
round
to
the
great
gate
bellowing
for
the
sentry
to
open
he
came
at
once
with
a
dripping
torch
to
burst
into
roars
of
laughter
at
the
sight
of
me
my
wig
was
somewhere
in
the
lane
behind
me
he
knew
me
perfectly
in
my
silly
toggery
he
leaned
against
the
wall
helpless
with
laughing
shouting
feebly
to
his
comrades
to
come
share
the
jest
i
you
may
well
imagine
saw
nothing
funny
about
it
but
kicked
and
shook
the
grilles
in
my
rage
and
impatience
he
did
open
to
me
at
length
and
in
i
dashed
clamouring
for
vigo
he
had
appeared
in
the
court
by
this
as
also
half
a
dozen
of
the
guard
who
surrounded
me
with
shouts
of
astonished
mockery
but
i
little
heeding
cried
to
the
equery
vigo
le
comte
is
arrested
he
in
the
bastille
vigo
grasped
my
arm
and
lifted
rather
than
led
me
in
at
the
door
slamming
it
in
the
soldiers
faces
now
félix
m
étienne
i
gasped
étienne
is
arrested
they
were
lying
in
wait
for
him
at
the
back
of
the
house
by
the
tower
they
taken
him
off
in
a
coach
to
the
bastille
who
have
the
governor
guard
you
saddle
and
pursue
you
rescue
him
how
long
ago
about
ten
minutes
the
coach
was
standing
in
the
rue
de
they
left
a
man
guarding
me
but
i
broke
away
it
ca
be
done
vigo
said
they
be
out
of
the
quarter
by
now
if
i
could
catch
them
at
all
it
would
be
close
by
the
bastille
no
good
in
that
no
use
fighting
four
regiments
what
the
devil
are
they
arresting
him
for
félix
i
understand
mayenne
wants
his
blood
but
what
has
the
city
guard
to
do
with
it
it
lucas
game
i
said
then
i
remembered
that
we
had
not
confided
to
him
the
tale
of
the
first
arrest
i
went
on
to
tell
of
the
adventure
of
the
trois
lanternes
and
reflecting
that
he
might
better
know
just
how
the
land
lay
with
us
i
made
a
clean
breast
of
everything
the
fight
before
ferou
house
the
rescue
the
rencounter
in
the
tunnel
excursion
and
all
that
befell
in
the
i
wound
up
with
a
second
full
account
of
our
capture
under
the
very
walls
of
the
house
our
garroting
before
we
could
cry
on
the
guards
to
save
us
vigo
said
nothing
for
some
time
at
length
he
delivered
himself
monsieur
would
have
a
patrol
about
the
house
he
would
publish
to
the
mob
that
he
feared
any
danger
whatever
of
course
no
one
foresaw
this
however
the
arrest
is
the
best
thing
could
have
happened
vigo
i
gasped
in
horror
was
vigo
turned
traitor
the
solid
earth
reeled
beneath
my
feet
he
never
rest
till
he
got
himself
killed
vigo
went
on
hot
enough
but
étienne
mad
to
bind
if
they
had
caught
him
he
have
been
in
some
worse
pickle
while
as
it
is
he
safe
from
swords
at
least
but
they
can
murder
as
well
in
the
bastille
as
elsewhere
i
cried
vigo
shook
his
head
no
had
they
meant
murder
they
have
settled
him
here
in
the
alley
since
they
lugged
him
off
unhurt
they
do
mean
it
i
know
not
what
the
devil
they
are
up
to
but
it
is
that
it
was
lucas
game
in
the
first
place
i
repeated
he
too
prudent
to
come
out
in
the
open
and
fight
étienne
he
never
strikes
with
his
own
hand
his
way
is
to
make
some
one
else
strike
for
him
so
he
gets
étienne
into
the
bastille
that
the
first
step
i
suppose
he
thinks
mayenne
will
attend
to
the
second
mayenne
dares
not
take
the
boy
life
vigo
answered
he
could
have
killed
him
an
he
chose
in
the
streets
and
nobody
the
wiser
but
now
that
monsieur
taken
publicly
to
the
bastille
mayenne
dares
not
kill
him
there
by
foul
play
or
by
law
the
duke
of
quentin
son
no
all
mayenne
can
do
is
to
confine
him
at
his
good
pleasure
whence
presently
we
will
pluck
him
out
at
king
henry
good
pleasure
and
meantime
is
he
to
rot
behind
bars
unless
monsieur
can
get
him
out
but
then
vigo
went
on
a
month
or
two
in
a
cell
wo
be
a
bad
thing
for
him
neither
his
head
will
have
a
chance
to
cool
after
a
dose
of
mayenne
purge
he
may
recover
of
his
fever
for
mayenne
ward
monsieur
you
will
send
to
monsieur
of
course
you
will
go
and
gilles
with
you
to
keep
you
out
of
mischief
when
now
no
said
vigo
you
will
go
clothe
yourself
in
breeches
first
else
are
you
not
likely
to
arrive
anywhere
but
at
the
and
then
eat
your
supper
it
a
long
road
to
st
denis
i
ran
at
once
through
a
fusillade
of
jeers
from
soldiers
grooms
and
across
the
court
through
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
to
marcel
chamber
never
was
i
gladder
of
anything
in
my
life
than
to
doff
those
swaddling
petticoats
two
minutes
and
i
was
a
man
again
i
found
it
in
my
heart
to
pity
the
poor
things
who
must
wear
the
trappings
their
lives
long
but
for
all
my
joy
in
my
freedom
i
choked
over
my
supper
and
pushed
it
away
half
tasted
in
misery
over
étienne
vigo
might
say
comfortably
that
mayenne
dared
not
kill
him
but
i
thought
there
were
few
things
that
gentleman
dared
not
do
then
there
was
lucas
to
be
reckoned
with
he
had
caught
his
fly
in
the
web
he
was
not
likely
to
let
him
go
long
undevoured
at
best
if
étienne
life
were
safe
yet
was
he
helpless
while
our
mademoiselle
was
to
marry
vigo
seemed
to
think
that
a
blessing
but
i
was
nigh
to
weeping
into
my
soup
the
one
ray
of
light
was
that
she
was
not
to
marry
lucas
that
was
something
still
when
étienne
came
out
of
prison
if
ever
he
did
i
could
scarce
bring
myself
to
believe
it
he
would
find
his
dear
vanished
over
the
rocky
pyrenees
vigo
would
not
even
let
me
start
when
i
was
ready
since
we
were
too
late
to
find
the
gates
open
we
must
wait
till
ten
of
the
clock
at
which
hour
the
denis
gate
would
be
in
the
hands
of
a
certain
brissac
who
would
pass
us
with
a
wink
at
the
word
quentin
i
was
so
wroth
with
vigo
that
i
would
not
stay
with
him
but
went
into
étienne
silent
chamber
and
flung
myself
down
on
the
his
head
might
never
touch
again
and
wondered
how
he
was
faring
in
prison
i
wished
i
were
there
with
him
i
cared
not
much
what
the
place
was
so
long
as
we
were
together
i
had
gone
down
the
mouth
of
hell
smiling
so
be
it
i
went
at
his
heels
mayhap
if
i
had
struggled
harder
with
my
captors
shown
my
sex
earlier
they
had
taken
me
too
heartily
i
wished
they
had
i
trow
i
am
the
only
wight
ever
did
wish
himself
behind
bars
and
promptly
i
repented
me
for
if
vigo
had
proved
but
a
broken
reed
there
was
monsieur
monsieur
was
not
likely
to
sit
smug
and
declare
prison
the
best
place
for
his
son
the
slow
twilight
faded
altogether
and
the
dark
came
the
city
was
very
still
once
in
a
while
a
shout
or
a
sound
of
bell
was
borne
over
the
roofs
or
infrequent
voices
and
footsteps
sounded
in
the
street
beyond
our
gate
the
men
in
the
court
under
my
window
were
quiet
too
talking
among
themselves
without
much
raillery
or
laughter
i
knew
they
discussed
the
unhappy
plight
of
the
heir
of
quentin
the
chimes
had
rung
some
time
ago
the
after
nine
and
i
was
fidgeting
to
be
off
but
huffed
as
i
was
with
him
i
could
not
lower
myself
to
go
ask
vigo
leave
to
start
he
might
come
after
me
when
he
wanted
me
félix
félix
marcel
shouted
down
the
corridor
i
sprang
up
then
remembering
my
dignity
moved
no
further
but
bade
him
come
in
to
me
where
are
you
mooning
in
the
dark
he
demanded
stumbling
over
the
threshold
oh
there
you
are
dame
you
come
mighty
quick
if
you
knew
what
was
there
for
you
what
i
cried
divided
between
the
wild
hope
that
it
was
monsieur
and
the
wilder
one
that
it
was
étienne
do
you
wish
i
tell
you
well
you
a
good
boy
and
i
will
the
prettiest
lass
i
seen
in
a
month
of
sundays
you
in
your
petticoats
do
come
near
her
for
me
i
stuttered
aye
she
asked
for
le
duc
and
when
he
was
here
for
you
i
suppose
it
some
friend
of
m
étienne
i
supposed
so
indeed
i
supposed
it
was
the
owner
of
my
borrowed
plumage
come
to
claim
her
own
angry
perhaps
because
i
had
not
returned
it
to
her
i
wondered
whether
she
would
scratch
my
eyes
out
because
i
had
lost
the
cap
whether
i
could
find
it
if
i
went
to
look
with
a
light
none
too
eagerly
i
descended
to
her
she
was
standing
against
the
wall
in
the
archway
two
or
three
of
the
guardsmen
were
about
her
one
with
a
flambeau
by
which
they
were
all
surveying
her
she
wore
the
coif
and
blouse
the
black
bodice
and
short
striped
skirt
of
the
country
peasant
girl
and
like
a
country
girl
she
showed
a
face
flushed
and
downcast
under
the
soldiers
bold
scrutiny
she
looked
up
at
me
as
at
a
rescuing
angel
it
was
mlle
de
montluc
i
dashed
past
the
nearly
upsetting
him
in
my
haste
and
snatched
her
hand
mademoiselle
come
into
the
house
she
clutched
me
with
fingers
as
cold
as
marble
which
trembled
on
mine
where
is
de
st
quentin
at
st
denis
you
must
take
me
there
i
was
going
i
stammered
bewildered
but
you
mademoiselle
you
knew
of
de
mar
arrest
aye
what
coil
is
this
félix
demanded
vigo
coming
up
he
took
the
torch
from
his
man
and
held
it
in
mademoiselle
face
whereupon
an
amazing
change
came
over
his
own
he
lowered
the
light
shielding
it
with
his
hand
as
if
it
were
an
impertinent
eye
you
are
vigo
she
said
at
once
yes
and
i
know
not
what
noble
lady
mademoiselle
can
be
save
will
it
please
her
to
come
into
the
house
he
led
the
way
with
his
torch
not
suffering
himself
to
look
at
her
again
he
had
his
foot
on
the
staircase
when
she
called
to
him
as
if
she
had
been
accustomed
to
addressing
him
all
her
life
vigo
this
will
do
i
will
speak
to
you
here
as
mademoiselle
wishes
i
thought
the
salon
fitter
my
cabinet
here
will
be
quieter
than
the
hall
mademoiselle
he
opened
the
door
and
she
entered
he
pushed
me
in
next
giving
me
the
torch
and
saying
ask
mademoiselle
félix
whether
she
wants
me
he
amazed
me
he
who
always
ordered
i
want
you
vigo
mademoiselle
answered
him
herself
i
want
you
to
send
two
men
with
me
to
st
denis
no
but
mademoiselle
can
not
go
to
st
denis
i
can
and
i
must
they
will
not
let
a
through
the
gate
at
night
vigo
began
we
will
go
on
foot
mademoiselle
vigo
answered
as
if
she
had
proposed
flying
to
the
moon
you
can
not
walk
to
st
denis
i
must
she
cried
i
had
put
the
flambeau
in
a
socket
on
the
wall
now
that
the
light
shone
on
her
steadily
i
saw
for
the
first
time
though
i
might
have
known
it
from
her
presence
here
how
rent
with
emotion
she
was
white
to
the
lips
with
gleaming
eyes
and
stormy
breast
she
had
spoken
low
and
quietly
but
it
was
a
composure
liable
to
snap
like
glass
i
thought
her
on
the
very
verge
of
passionate
tears
vigo
looked
at
her
puzzled
troubled
pitying
as
on
some
beautiful
mad
creature
she
cried
out
on
him
suddenly
her
rich
voice
going
up
a
key
you
need
not
say
can
not
to
me
vigo
you
know
not
how
i
came
here
i
was
locked
in
my
chamber
i
changed
clothes
with
my
norman
maid
there
was
a
sentry
at
each
end
of
the
street
i
slid
down
a
rope
of
my
bedclothes
it
was
dark
they
did
not
see
me
i
knocked
at
door
thank
the
saints
it
opened
to
me
quickly
i
told
ferou
god
forgive
me
i
had
business
for
the
duke
at
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
he
took
me
through
and
i
came
here
but
mademoiselle
the
bats
i
cried
yes
the
bats
she
returned
with
a
little
smile
and
my
hands
on
the
ropes
she
turned
them
over
the
skin
was
torn
cruelly
from
her
delicate
palms
and
the
inside
of
her
fingers
little
threads
of
blood
marked
the
scores
then
i
came
here
she
repeated
in
all
my
life
i
have
never
been
in
the
streets
alone
not
even
for
one
step
at

can
not

to
st
denis
mademoiselle
it
is
yours
to
say
what
you
can
do
as
for
me
i
dropped
on
my
knees
and
laid
my
lips
to
her
fingers
softly
for
fear
even
their
pressure
might
hurt
her
tenderness
mademoiselle
i
cried
in
pure
delight
mademoiselle
that
you
are
here
she
flushed
under
my
words
ah
it
is
no
little
thing
brought
me
you
knew
de
mar
was
arrested
we
assented
she
went
on
more
to
me
than
to
vigo
as
if
in
telling
me
she
was
telling
étienne
she
spoke
low
as
if
in
pain
after
supper
de
mayenne
went
back
to
his
cabinet
and
let
out
paul
de
lorraine
i
wish
we
had
killed
him
i
muttered
we
had
no
time
or
weapons
de
mayenne
sent
for
me
then
she
went
on
wetting
her
lips
i
have
never
seen
him
so
angry
he
was
furious
because
de
mar
had
been
before
his
face
and
he
had
not
known
it
he
felt
he
had
been
made
a
mock
of
he
raged
against
me
i
never
knew
he
could
be
so
angry
he
said
the
spanish
envoy
was
too
good
for
me
i
should
marry
paul
de
lorraine
mordieu
mademoiselle
that
was
not
it
i
had
borne
that
she
cried
mayhap
i
deserved
it
but
while
my
lord
thundered
at
me
word
came
that
de
mar
was
taken
my
lord
swore
he
should
die
he
swore
no
man
ever
set
him
at
naught
and
lived
to
boast
of
it
will
she
swept
on
unheeding
he
said
he
should
be
tried
for
the
murder
of
pontou
he
should
be
tortured
to
make
him
confess
it
she
dropped
down
on
her
knees
hiding
her
face
in
her
arms
on
the
table
shaking
from
head
to
foot
as
in
an
ague
vigo
swore
to
himself
loudly
violently
if
mayenne
do
that
by
the
throne
of
heaven
i
kill
him
she
sprang
to
her
feet
fierce
as
a
young
lioness
is
that
all
you
can
say
mayenne
may
torture
him
and
be
killed
for
it
i
shall

but
if
he
would
save
his
secrets
he
must
give
up
de
mar
mother
of
god
i
have
been
his
obedient
child
i
have
let
him
do
so
with
me
as
he
would
i
sent
my
lover
away
i
consented
to
the
spanish
marriage
but
to
this
i
will
not
submit
he
shall
not

and
kill
étienne
de
mar
vigo
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
shall
we
start

at

the

said
patting
her
hand
in
both
of
his
forgetting
she
was
a
great
lady
he
an
equery
fear
not
you
will
save
him
mademoiselle
let
us
go
she
cried
feverishly
let
us
go
gilles
was
in
the
court
waiting
stripped
of
his
livery
dressed
peaceably
as
a
porter
but
with
a
mallet
in
his
hand
that
i
should
not
like
to
receive
on
my
crown
i
thought
we
were
ready
but
vigo
bade
us
wait
i
stood
on
the
with
mademoiselle
while
he
took
aside
squinting
charlot
for
a
emphatic
interview
must
we
wait
mademoiselle
urged
me
quivering
like
the
arrow
on
the
they
may
discover
i
am
gone
need
we
wait
aye
i
answered
if
vigo
bids
us
he
knows
we
waited
then
vigo
disappeared
presently
mademoiselle
and
i
stood
patient
with
oh
what
impatience
in
our
hearts
wondering
how
he
could
so
hinder
us
not
till
he
came
back
did
it
dawn
on
me
for
what
we
had
stayed
he
was
dressed
as
an
not
a
tag
of
quentin
colours
on
him
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
mademoiselle
i
had
to
give
my
lieutenant
his
orders
now
if
you
will
give
the
word
we
go
do
you
go
m
vigo
she
breathed
deep
it
was
easy
to
see
she
looked
upon
him
as
a
regiment
of
course
vigo
answered
as
if
there
could
be
no
other
way
i
said
in
pure
devilry
to
try
to
ruffle
him
vigo
you
said
you
were
here
to
guard
monsieur
house
his
goods
his
moneys
do
you
desert
your
trust
mademoiselle
turned
quickly
to
him
vigo
you
must
not
let
me
take
you
from
your
rightful
post
félix
and
your
man
here
will
care
for
me
the
boy
talks
silliness
mademoiselle
vigo
returned
tranquilly
mademoiselle
is
worth
a
dozen
hôtels
i
go
with
her
he
walked
beside
her
across
the
court
i
following
with
gilles
laughing
to
myself
only
yesterday
had
vigo
declared
that
never
would
he
give
aid
and
comfort
to
mlle
de
montluc
it
was
no
marvel
she
had
conquered
étienne
for
he
must
needs
have
been
in
love
with
some
one
but
in
bringing
vigo
to
her
feet
she
had
won
a
triumph
indeed
we
had
to
go
out
by
the
great
gate
because
the
key
of
the
postern
was
in
the
bastille
but
as
if
by
magic
every
guardsman
and
had
disappeared
there
was
not
one
to
stare
at
the
lady
though
when
we
had
passed
some
one
locked
the
gates
behind
us
vigo
called
me
up
to
mademoiselle
left
gilles
was
to
loiter
behind
far
enough
to
seem
not
to
belong
to
us
near
enough
to
come
up
at
need
thus
at
a
good
pace
mademoiselle
stepping
out
as
brave
as
any
of
us
we
set
out
across
the
city
for
the
porte
denis
our
quarter
was
very
quiet
we
scarce
met
a
soul
but
afterward
as
we
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
the
markets
the
streets
grew
livelier
now
were
we
gladder
than
ever
of
vigo
escort
for
whenever
we
approached
a
band
of
roisterers
or
of
gentlemen
with
lights
mademoiselle
sheltered
herself
behind
the
equery
broad
back
hidden
as
behind
a
tower
once
the
gallant
de
champfleury
he
who
in
pink
silk
had
adorned
mme
de
mayenne
salon
passed
close
enough
to
touch
her
she
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
was
by
for
her
own
sake
she
had
no
fear
the
midnight
streets
the
open
road
to
denis
had
no
power
to
daunt
her
but
the
dread
of
being
recognized
and
turned
back
rode
her
like
a
nightmare
close
by
the
gate
vigo
bade
us
pause
in
the
door
of
a
shop
while
he
went
forward
to
reconnoiter
before
long
he
returned
bad
luck
mademoiselle
brissac
not
on
i
do
know
the
officer
but
he
knows
me
that
the
worst
of
it
he
told
me
this
was
not
quentin
night
well
we
must
try
the
porte
neuve
but
mademoiselle
demurred
that
will
be
out
of
our
way
will
it
not
vigo
it
is
a
longer
road
from
the
porte
neuve
to
st
denis
yes
but
what
to
do
we
must
get
through
the
walls
suppose
we
fare
no
better
at
the
porte
neuve
if
your
brissac
is
suspected
he
not
be
on
at
night
vigo
i
propose
that
we
part
company
here
they
will
not
know
gilles
and
félix
at
the
gate
will
they
no
vigo
said
doubtfully
but
then
can
we
get
through
she
cried
they
will
not
stop
us
such
humble
folk
we
are
going
to
the
bedside
of
our
dying
mother
at
denis
your
name
gilles
forestier
mademoiselle
he
stammered
startled
then
are
we
all
forestiers
gilles
félix
and
jeanne
we
can
pass
out
vigo
i
am
sure
we
can
pass
out
i
am
loath
to
part
with
you
but
i
fear
to
go
through
the
city
to
the
porte
neuve
my
absence
may
be
discovered
i
must
place
myself
without
the
walls
speedily
well
mademoiselle
may
try
it
vigo
gave
reluctant
consent
if
you
are
refused
we
can
fall
back
on
the
porte
neuve
if
you
succeed
listen
to
me
you
fellows
you
will
deliver
mademoiselle
into
monsieur
hands
or
answer
to
me
for
it
if
any
one
touches
her
little
finger
well
trust
me
that
understood
we
answered
saluting
together
mademoiselle
need
have
no
doubts
of
them
vigo
said
félix
is
le
comte
own
henchman
and
gilles
is
the
best
man
in
the
household
next
to
me
god
speed
you
my
lady
i
am
here
if
they
turn
you
back
we
went
boldly
round
the
corner
and
up
the
street
to
the
gate
the
sentry
walking
his
beat
ordered
us
away
without
so
much
as
looking
at
us
then
gilles
appointed
our
spokesman
demanded
to
see
the
captain
of
the
watch
his
errand
was
urgent
but
the
sentry
showed
no
disposition
to
budge
had
we
a
passport
no
we
had
no
passport
then
we
could
go
about
our
business
there
was
no
leaving
paris
for
us
call
the
captain
no
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
be
off
then
but
at
this
moment
hearing
the
altercation
the
officer
himself
came
out
of
the
in
the
tower
and
to
him
gilles
at
once
began
his
story
our
mother
at
denis
had
sent
for
us
to
come
to
her
dying
bed
he
was
a
the
messenger
had
had
trouble
to
find
him
his
young
brother
and
sister
were
in
service
kept
to
their
duties
till
late
our
mother
might
even
now
be
yielding
up
the
ghost
it
was
a
pitiful
case
le
capitaine
might
we
not
be
permitted
to
pass
the
young
officer
appeared
less
interested
in
this
moving
tale
than
in
the
face
of
mademoiselle
lighted
up
by
the
flambeau
on
the
tower
wall
i
should
be
glad
to
oblige
your
charming
sister
he
returned
smiling
but
none
goes
out
of
the
city
without
a
passport
perhaps
you
have
one
though
from
my
lord
mayenne
would
our
kind
be
carrying
a
passport
from
the
duke
of
mayenne
quoth
gilles
it
seems
improbable
the
officer
smiled
pleased
with
his
wit
sorry
to
discommode
you
my
dear
but
perhaps
lacking
a
passport
you
can
yet
oblige
me
with
the
countersign
which
does
as
well
just
one
little
word
now
and
i
let
you
through
illustration
it
desolates
me
to
hear
of
her
extremity
if
monsieur
will
tell
me
the
little
word
she
asked
innocently
he
burst
into
laughter
no
no
i
am
not
to
be
caught
so
easy
as
that
my
girl
oh
come
monsieur
captain
gilles
urged
many
and
many
a
fellow
goes
in
and
out
of
paris
without
a
passport
the
rules
are
a
net
to
stop
big
fish
and
let
the
small
fry
go
what
harm
will
it
do
to
my
lord
mayenne
or
you
or
anybody
if
you
have
the
gentleness
to
let
three
poor
servants
through
to
their
dying
mother
it
desolates
me
to
hear
of
her
extremity
the
captain
answered
with
a
fine
irony
but
i
am
here
to
do
my
duty
i
am
thinking
my
dear
that
you
are
some
great
lady
maid
he
was
eying
her
sharply
suspiciously
she
made
haste
to
protest
oh
no
monsieur
i
am
servant
to
mme
mesnier
the
grocer
wife
and
perhaps
you
serve
in
the
shop
no
monsieur
she
said
not
seeing
his
drift
but
on
guard
against
a
trap
no
monsieur
i
am
never
in
the
shop
i
am
far
too
busy
with
my
work
monsieur
does
not
seem
to
understand
what
a
has
to
do
for
answer
he
took
her
hand
and
lifted
it
to
the
light
revealing
all
its
smooth
whiteness
its
dainty
polished
nails
i
think
mademoiselle
does
not
understand
it
either
with
a
little
cry
she
snatched
her
hand
from
him
hiding
it
in
the
folds
of
her
kirtle
regarding
him
with
open
terror
he
softened
somewhat
at
sight
of
her
distress
well
it
none
of
my
business
if
a
lady
chooses
to
be
masquerading
round
the
streets
at
night
with
a
porter
and
a
lackey
i
do
know
what
your
purpose
is
i
do
ask
to
know
but
i
here
to
keep
my
gate
and
i
keep
it
go
try
to
wheedle
the
officer
at
the
porte
neuve
in
helpless
obedience
glad
of
even
so
much
leniency
we
turned
away
to
face
a
tall
grizzled
veteran
in
a
colonel
with
a
dragoon
at
his
back
he
had
come
so
softly
out
of
a
side
alley
that
not
even
the
captain
had
marked
him
what
this
guilbert
he
demanded
some
folks
seeking
to
get
through
the
gates
sir
i
just
turned
them
away
what
were
you
saying
about
the
porte
neuve
i
said
they
could
go
see
how
that
gate
is
kept
i
showed
them
how
this
is
why
must
you
pass
through
at
this
time
of
night
said
the
commanding
officer
civilly
gilles
once
again
bemoaned
the
dying
mother
the
young
captain
eager
to
prove
his
fidelity
interrupted
him
i
believe
that
a
sir
there
something
queer
about
these
people
the
girl
says
she
is
a
grocer
servant
and
has
hands
like
a
duchess
the
colonel
looked
at
us
sharply
neither
friendly
nor
unfriendly
he
said
in
a
perfectly
neutral
manner
it
is
of
no
consequence
whether
she
be
a
servant
or
a
duchess
has
a
mother
or
not
the
point
is
whether
these
people
have
the
countersign
if
they
have
it
they
can
pass
whoever
they
are
they
have
not
the
captain
answered
at
once
i
think
you
would
do
well
sir
to
demand
the
lady
name
mademoiselle
started
forward
for
a
bold
stroke
just
as
the
superior
officer
demanded
of
her
the
countersign
as
he
said
the
word
she
pronounced
distinctly
her
name
lorance
enough
the
colonel
said
instantly
pass
them
through
guilbert
the
young
captain
stood
in
a
mull
but
no
more
bewildered
than
we
mighty
queer
he
muttered
why
did
she
give
it
to
me
stir
yourself
sir
his
superior
gave
sharp
command
they
have
the
countersign
pass
them
through
xxviii
denis
and
navarre
as
the
gates
clanged
into
place
behind
us
gilles
stopped
short
in
his
tracks
to
say
as
if
addressing
the
darkness
before
him
am
i
gilles
awake
or
asleep
are
we
in
paris
or
are
we
on
the
denis
road
oh
come
come
mademoiselle
hastened
us
on
murmuring
half
to
herself
as
we
went
o
you
kind
saints
i
saw
he
could
not
make
us
out
for
friends
or
foes
i
thought
my
name
might
turn
the
scale
mayenne
always
gives
a
name
for
a
countersign
by
a
marvel
it
was
mine
i
like
not
to
think
often
of
that
tramp
to
denis
the
road
was
dark
rutty
and
in
places
still
miry
from
monday
night
rain
strange
shadows
dogged
us
all
the
way
sometimes
they
were
only
bushes
or
wayside
shrines
but
sometimes
they
moved
this
was
not
now
a
wolf
country
but
wolves
were
plenty
and
as
dangerous
the
of
the
army
beggars
feagues
and
footpads
hovered
like
the
cowardly
beasts
of
prey
they
were
about
the
outskirts
of
the
city
did
a
leaf
rustle
we
started
did
a
shambling
shape
in
the
gloom
whine
for
alms
we
made
ready
for
onset
gilles
produced
from
some
place
of
concealment
his
jerkin
or
his
leggings
or
somewhere
a
brace
of
pistols
and
we
walked
with
finger
on
trigger
taking
care
whenever
a
rustle
in
the
grass
a
shadow
in
the
bushes
seemed
to
follow
us
to
talk
loud
and
cheerfully
of
common
things
the
little
interests
of
a
humble
station
thanks
to
this
diplomacy
or
the
shining
in
the
faint
starlight
none
molested
us
though
we
encountered
more
than
one
mysterious
company
we
never
passed
into
the
gloom
under
an
arch
of
trees
without
the
resolution
to
fight
for
our
lives
we
never
came
out
again
into
the
faint
light
of
the
open
road
without
wondering
thanks
to
the
saints
silent
thanks
for
we
never
spoke
a
word
of
any
fear
gilles
and
i
trow
mademoiselle
knew
well
enough
but
she
spoke
no
word
either
she
never
faltered
never
showed
by
so
much
as
the
turn
of
her
head
that
she
suspected
any
danger
but
eyes
on
the
distant
lights
of
denis
walked
straight
along
half
a
step
ahead
of
us
all
the
way
stride
as
we
might
we
two
strong
fellows
could
never
quite
keep
up
with
her
the
journey
could
not
at
such
pace
stretch
out
forever
presently
the
distant
lights
were
no
longer
distant
but
near
nearer
close
at
hand
the
lights
of
the
outposts
of
the
camp
a
sentinel
started
out
from
the
quoin
of
a
wall
to
stop
us
but
when
we
had
told
our
errand
he
became
as
friendly
as
a
brother
he
went
across
the
road
into
a
neighbouring
tournebride
to
report
to
the
officer
of
the
guard
and
came
back
presently
with
a
torch
and
the
order
to
take
us
to
the
duke
of
quentin
lodging
it
was
near
an
hour
after
midnight
and
denis
was
in
bed
save
for
a
drowsy
patrol
here
and
there
we
met
no
one
fewer
than
the
patrols
were
the
lanterns
hung
on
ropes
across
the
streets
these
were
the
only
lights
for
the
houses
were
one
and
all
as
dark
as
tombs
not
till
we
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
town
did
we
see
in
the
second
story
of
a
house
in
the
square
a
beam
of
light
shining
through
the
some
one
in
mischief
gilles
pointed
aye
laughed
the
sentry
your
duke
this
is
where
he
lodges
over
the
saddler
he
knocked
with
the
butt
of
his
musket
on
the
door
the
shutter
above
creaked
open
and
a
voice
monsieur
voice
asked
who
there
mademoiselle
was
concealed
in
the
embrasure
of
the
doorway
gilles
and
i
stepped
back
into
the
street
where
monsieur
could
see
us
gilles
forestier
and
félix
broux
monsieur
just
from
paris
with
news
wait
is
it
all
right
le
duc
the
sentry
asked
saluting
yes
monsieur
answered
closing
the
shutter
the
soldier
with
another
salute
to
the
blank
window
and
a
nod
of
then
to
us
went
back
to
his
post
left
in
darkness
we
presently
heard
monsieur
quick
step
on
the
flags
of
the
hall
and
the
clatter
of
the
bolts
he
opened
to
us
standing
there
fully
dressed
with
a
guttering
candle
my
son
he
said
instantly
mademoiselle
crouching
in
the
shadow
of
the
pushed
me
forward
i
saw
i
was
to
tell
him
monsieur
he
was
arrested
and
driven
to
the
bastille
between
seven
and
eight
lucas
paul
de
lorraine
went
to
the
governor
and
swore
that
étienne
killed
the
lackey
pontou
in
the
house
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
it
was
lucas
killed
him
lucas
told
mayenne
so
mlle
de
montluc
heard
him
too
and
here
is
mademoiselle
at
the
word
she
came
out
of
the
shadow
and
slowly
over
the
threshold
her
alarm
and
passion
had
swept
her
to
the
door
of
the
hôtel
quentin
as
a
whirlwind
sweeps
a
leaf
she
had
come
without
thought
of
herself
without
pause
without
fear
but
now
the
first
heat
of
her
impulse
was
gone
her
long
tramp
had
left
her
faint
and
weary
and
here
she
had
to
face
not
an
equery
and
a
page
hers
to
command
but
a
great
duke
the
enemy
of
her
house
she
came
blushfully
in
her
peasant
dress
shoes
dirty
from
the
common
road
hair
ruffled
by
the
night
winds
to
show
herself
for
the
first
time
to
her
lover
father
opposer
of
her
hopes
thwarter
of
her
marriage
proud
and
shy
she
drifted
over
the
and
stood
a
moment
neither
lifting
her
eyes
nor
speaking
like
a
bird
whom
the
least
movement
would
startle
into
flight
but
monsieur
made
none
he
kept
as
still
as
as
she
looking
at
her
as
if
he
could
hardly
believe
her
presence
real
then
as
the
silence
prolonged
itself
it
seemed
to
frighten
her
more
than
the
harsh
speech
she
may
have
feared
with
a
desperate
courage
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
face
the
spell
was
broken
monsieur
stepped
forward
at
once
to
her
mademoiselle
you
have
come
a
journey
you
are
tired
let
me
give
you
some
refreshment
then
will
you
tell
me
the
story
it
was
an
unlucky
speech
for
she
had
been
on
the
very
point
of
unburdening
herself
but
now
without
a
word
she
accepted
his
escort
down
the
passage
but
as
she
went
she
flung
me
an
imploring
glance
i
was
to
come
too
gilles
bolted
the
door
again
and
sat
down
to
wait
on
the
staircase
but
i
though
my
lord
had
not
bidden
me
followed
him
and
mademoiselle
it
troubled
me
that
she
should
so
dread
him
him
the
of
all
men
but
if
she
needed
me
to
give
her
confidence
here
i
was
monsieur
led
her
into
a
little
square
parlour
at
the
end
of
the
passage
it
was
just
behind
the
shop
i
knew
it
smelt
so
of
leather
it
was
doubtless
the
of
the
saddler
family
monsieur
set
his
candle
down
on
the
big
table
in
the
middle
then
on
second
thought
took
it
up
again
and
lighted
two
iron
sconces
on
the
wall
pray
sit
mademoiselle
and
rest
he
bade
for
she
was
starting
up
in
nervousness
from
the
chair
where
he
had
put
her
i
will
return
in
a
moment
when
he
had
gone
from
the
room
i
said
to
her
half
hesitating
yet
eagerly
mademoiselle
you
were
never
afraid
on
the
way
where
there
was
good
cause
for
fear
but
now
there
is
nothing
to
dread
she
rose
and
fluttered
round
the
walls
of
the
room
looking
for
something
i
thought
it
was
for
a
way
of
escape
but
it
was
not
for
she
passed
the
three
doors
and
came
back
to
her
place
with
an
air
of
disappointment
smoothing
the
loose
strands
of
her
hair
i
never
before
went
anywhere
unmasked
she
murmured
monsieur
entered
with
a
salver
containing
a
silver
cup
of
wine
and
some
rheims
biscuit
he
offered
it
to
her
formally
she
accepted
with
scarcely
audible
thanks
and
sat
barely
touching
the
wine
to
her
lips
crumbling
the
biscuit
into
bits
with
restless
fingers
making
the
pretence
of
a
meal
serve
as
excuse
for
her
silence
monsieur
glanced
at
her
waiting
for
her
to
speak
had
the
infanta
isabella
come
to
visit
him
he
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
it
seemed
to
him
discourteous
to
press
her
he
waited
for
her
to
explain
her
presence
i
wanted
to
shake
mademoiselle
with
a
dozen
swift
words
with
a
glance
of
her
blue
eyes
she
could
sweep
monsieur
off
his
feet
as
she
had
swept
vigo
and
instead
she
sat
there
not
daring
to
look
at
him
like
a
child
caught
stealing
sweets
she
had
found
words
to
defend
herself
from
the
teasing
tongues
at
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
to
plead
for
me
to
lash
lucas
to
move
mayenne
himself
but
she
could
not
find
one
syllable
for
the
duke
of
quentin
she
had
been
to
admiration
the
laughing
coquette
the
stout
champion
the
haughty
great
lady
the
frank
lover
but
now
she
was
the
shy
child
blushing
stammering
constrained
had
monsieur
attacked
her
with
blunt
questions
had
he
demanded
of
her
up
and
down
what
had
brought
her
this
strange
road
at
such
amazing
hour
and
in
such
unfitting
company
she
must
needs
have
answered
and
once
started
she
would
quickly
have
kindled
her
fire
again
had
he
on
other
part
with
a
smile
an
encouraging
word
given
her
ever
so
little
a
push
she
had
gone
on
easily
enough
but
he
did
neither
he
was
courteous
and
cold
partly
was
his
coldness
real
he
could
not
look
on
her
as
other
than
the
daughter
of
his
enemy
house
ward
of
the
man
who
had
schemed
to
kill
him
who
had
lured
his
son
to
disaster
partly
was
it
mere
absence
étienne
plight
was
more
to
him
than
mademoiselle
when
she
spoke
not
he
turned
impatiently
to
me
tell
me
félix
all
about
it
before
i
could
answer
him
the
door
behind
us
opened
to
admit
two
gentlemen
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
were
dressed
much
alike
plainly
in
black
one
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
tall
and
dark
and
of
a
gravity
and
dignity
beyond
his
years
living
was
serious
business
to
him
his
eyes
were
thoughtful
steady
and
a
little
cold
his
companion
was
some
ten
years
older
his
beard
and
curling
hair
worn
away
from
his
forehead
by
the
helmet
chafing
were
already
sprinkled
with
gray
he
had
a
great
beak
of
a
nose
and
eyes
as
keen
as
a
hawk
and
a
look
of
amazing
life
and
vim
the
air
about
him
seemed
to
tingle
with
it
we
had
all
done
something
we
others
we
were
no
shirks
or
sluggards
but
the
force
in
him
put
us
out
penny
candles
before
the
sun
i
deem
not
jeanne
the
maid
did
any
marvel
when
she
recognized
king
charles
at
chinon
here
was
i
a
common
lout
never
heard
a
heavenly
voice
in
all
my
days
yet
i
knew
in
the
flick
of
an
eye
that
this
was
henri
quatre
i
was
hot
and
cold
and
trembling
my
heart
pounding
till
it
was
like
to
choke
me
i
had
never
dreamed
of
finding
myself
in
the
presence
i
had
never
thought
to
face
any
man
greater
than
my
duke
for
the
moment
i
was
utterly
discomfited
then
i
bethought
me
that
not
for
god
alone
were
knees
given
to
man
and
i
slid
down
quietly
to
the
floor
hoping
i
did
right
but
reflecting
for
my
comfort
that
in
any
case
i
was
too
small
to
give
great
offence
mademoiselle
started
out
of
her
chair
and
swept
a
curtsey
almost
to
the
ground
holding
the
lowly
pose
like
a
lady
of
marble
only
monsieur
remained
standing
as
he
was
as
if
a
king
was
an
affair
with
him
i
always
thought
monsieur
a
great
man
but
now
i
knew
it
the
king
leaving
his
companion
to
close
the
door
was
across
the
room
in
three
strides
i
am
come
to
look
after
you
quentin
he
cried
laughing
i
can
not
have
my
council
broken
up
by
pretty
grisettes
the
precedent
is
dangerous
with
the
liveliest
curiosity
and
amusement
he
surveyed
the
top
of
mademoiselle
bent
head
and
monsieur
puzzled
troubled
countenance
this
is
no
grisette
sire
monsieur
answered
but
a
very
demoiselle
indeed
cousin
to
my
lord
mayenne
astonishment
flashed
over
the
king
mobile
face
his
manner
changed
in
an
instant
to
one
of
utmost
deference
rise
mademoiselle
he
begged
as
if
her
appearance
were
the
most
natural
and
desirable
thing
in
the
world
i
could
wish
it
were
my
good
adversary
mayenne
himself
who
was
come
to
treat
with
us
but
be
assured
his
cousin
shall
lack
no
courtesy
she
swayed
lightly
to
her
feet
raising
her
face
to
the
king
into
his
countenance
which
mirrored
his
emotions
like
a
glass
came
a
quick
delight
at
the
sight
of
her
the
colour
waxed
and
waned
in
her
cheeks
her
breath
fluttered
uncertainly
her
eyes
anxious
eager
searched
his
face
i
cry
your
majesty
good
pardon
she
faltered
i
had
urgent
business
with
de
quentin
i
did
not
guess
he
was
with
your
majesty
the
king
business
is
glad
to
step
aside
for
yours
mademoiselle
she
curtseyed
blushing
hiding
her
eyes
under
their
sooty
lashes
thinking
as
i
did
i
made
no
doubt
here
was
a
king
indeed
his
majesty
went
on
i
can
well
believe
mademoiselle
is
no
trifling
matter
brings
you
at
midnight
to
our
rough
camp
we
will
not
delay
you
further
but
be
at
pains
to
remember
that
if
in
anything
henry
of
france
can
aid
you
he
stands
at
your
command
illustration
on
the
way
to
st
denis
he
made
her
a
noble
bow
and
took
her
hand
to
kiss
when
she
like
a
child
that
sees
itself
losing
a
protector
clutched
his
hand
in
her
little
trembling
fingers
her
wet
eyes
fixed
imploringly
on
his
face
he
beamed
upon
her
he
felt
no
desire
whatever
to
be
gone
am
i
to
stay
he
asked
radiantly
then
with
grave
gentleness
he
added
mademoiselle
is
in
trouble
will
she
bring
her
trouble
to
the
king
that
is
what
a
king
is
for
to
ease
his
subjects
burdens
she
could
not
speak
she
made
him
her
obeisance
with
a
look
out
of
the
depths
of
her
soul
then
are
you
my
subject
mademoiselle
he
demanded
slyly
she
shook
the
tears
from
her
lashes
and
found
her
voice
and
her
smile
to
answer
his
sire
i
was
a
true
ligueuse
this
morning
but
i
came
here
half
navarraise
and
now
i
swear
i
am
wholly
one
now
that
is
good
hearing
the
king
cried
such
a
recruit
from
mayenne
also
is
it
heartening
to
discover
that
my
conversion
is
not
the
only
sudden
one
in
the
world
it
has
taken
me
five
months
to
turn
my
coat
but
here
is
mademoiselle
turns
hers
in
a
day
he
had
glanced
over
his
shoulder
to
point
this
out
to
his
gentleman
but
now
he
faced
about
in
time
to
catch
his
recruit
looking
triste
again
mademoiselle
he
said
you
are
beautiful
grave
but
as
you
had
the
graciousness
to
show
me
just
now
still
more
beautiful
smiling
now
we
are
going
to
arrange
matters
so
that
you
will
smile
always
will
you
tell
me
what
is
the
trouble
my
child
gladly
sire
she
answered
and
dropped
down
a
moment
on
her
knees
before
him
to
kiss
his
hand
i
marvelled
that
mayenne
and
all
his
armies
had
been
able
to
keep
this
man
off
his
throne
and
in
his
saddle
four
long
years
it
was
plain
why
his
power
grew
stronger
every
day
why
every
hour
brought
him
new
allies
from
the
ranks
of
the
league
you
had
only
to
see
him
to
adore
him
once
get
him
into
paris
the
struggle
would
be
over
they
would
put
up
with
no
other
for
king
sire
mademoiselle
said
with
hesitancy
i
shall
tire
you
with
my
story
i
am
greatly
in
dread
of
it
the
king
answered
ceremoniously
placing
her
in
a
chair
before
seating
himself
to
listen
then
to
give
her
a
moment
i
think
to
collect
herself
he
turned
to
his
companion
here
rosny
if
you
ache
to
be
grubbing
over
your
papers
do
not
let
us
delay
you
i
am
in
no
haste
sire
his
gentleman
answered
unmoving
which
is
to
say
you
dare
not
leave
me
alone
the
king
laughed
out
i
tell
you
quentin
if
i
am
not
dragooned
into
a
staid
discreet
monarch
be
no
lapse
of
rosny
i
am
listening
mademoiselle
she
began
at
once
eager
and
unfaltering
all
her
confusion
was
gone
it
had
been
impossible
to
tell
the
story
to
de
quentin
impossible
to
tell
it
to
this
impassive
de
rosny
but
to
the
king
of
france
and
navarre
it
was
as
easy
to
talk
as
to
one
playfellow
sire
i
am
lorance
de
montluc
my
grandfather
was
the
marshal
montluc
were
next
monday
i
could
pray
rest
his
soul
the
king
rejoined
but
even
a
heretic
may
say
that
he
was
a
gallant
general
an
honour
to
france
he
married
a
sister
of
françois
le
balafré
and
mademoiselle
is
orphaned
now
and
my
friend
mayenne
ward
yes
sire
i
came
here
sire
to
tell
de
quentin
concerning
his
son
and
though
i
am
talking
of
myself
it
is
all
the
same
story
three
years
ago
after
the
king
died
de
mayenne
was
endeavouring
with
all
his
might
to
bring
the
duke
of
quentin
into
the
league
he
offered
me
to
him
for
his
son
de
mar
and
you
are
still
mlle
de
montluc
she
turned
to
monsieur
with
the
prettiest
smile
in
the
world
de
quentin
though
he
has
not
fought
for
you
sire
has
ever
been
loyal
the
king
exclaimed
he
is
either
an
incredible
loyalist
or
an
incredible
ass
even
the
grave
rosny
smiled
and
the
victim
laughed
as
he
defended
himself
that
my
loyalty
may
be
credible
sire
i
make
haste
to
say
that
i
had
never
seen
mademoiselle
till
this
hour
i
know
not
whether
to
think
better
of
you
for
that
or
worse
the
king
retorted
had
i
been
in
your
place
beshrew
me
but
i
should
have
seen
her
monsieur
smiled
and
was
silent
with
anxious
eyes
on
mademoiselle
de
quentin
withdrew
to
picardie
sire
but
de
mar
stayed
in
paris
and
my
cousin
mayenne
never
gave
up
entirely
the
notion
of
the
marriage
he
is
very
tenacious
of
his
plans
aye
said
the
king
with
a
grimace
well
i
know
he
blew
hot
and
cold
with
de
mar
he
favoured
the
marriage
on
sunday
and
scouted
it
on
wednesday
and
discussed
it
again
on
friday
and
what
were
de
mar
opinions
she
met
his
probing
gaze
blushing
but
candid
de
mar
sire
favoured
it
every
day
in
the
week
i
swear
he
did
the
king
cried
when
le
duc
came
back
to
paris
mademoiselle
went
on
and
it
was
known
he
had
espoused
your
cause
sire
mayenne
was
so
loath
to
lose
the
whole
house
of
quentin
to
you
that
he
offered
to
marry
me
out
of
hand
to
de
mar
and
he
refused
henry
cried
we
will
marry
you
to
a
king
son
on
my
honour
mademoiselle
sire
she
pleaded
you
promised
to
hear
me
that
i
will
then
but
i
warn
you
i
am
out
of
patience
with
these
st
quentins
then
you
are
out
of
patience
with
devotion
to
your
cause
sire
what
you
speak
for
the
recreants
i
assure
you
sire
you
have
no
more
loyal
servant
than
de
mar
strange
i
can
not
recollect
the
face
of
my
so
loyal
servant
the
king
said
dryly
but
she
with
a
fine
scorn
of
argument
made
the
audacious
answer
when
you
see
it
you
will
like
it
sire
not
half
so
well
as
i
like
yours
mademoiselle
i
promise
you
but
he
comes
to
me
well
commended
since
you
vouch
for
him
or
rather
he
does
not
come
what
is
this
ardent
follower
doing
so
long
away
from
me
where
the
devil
does
this
eager
partizan
keep
himself
quentin
where
is
your
son
he
had
been
with
you
long
ago
sire
but
for
the
bright
eyes
of
a
lady
of
the
league
and
now
she
comes
to
tell
me
my
page
tells
me
he
is
in
the
bastille
and
how
has
that
calamity
befallen
she
hesitated
a
moment
embarrassed
by
her
very
wealth
of
matter
confused
between
her
longing
to
set
the
whole
case
before
the
king
and
her
fear
of
wearying
his
patience
but
his
glance
told
her
she
need
have
no
misgiving
had
she
come
to
present
him
paris
he
could
not
have
been
more
interested
in
the
little
silence
monsieur
found
his
moment
and
his
words
sire
may
i
interrupt
mademoiselle
last
night
for
the
first
time
in
a
month
i
saw
my
son
he
was
just
returned
from
an
adventure
under
her
window
mayenne
guard
had
set
on
him
and
he
was
escaped
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
he
declared
to
me
that
never
till
he
was
slain
should
he
cease
endeavour
to
win
mlle
de
montluc
and
i
marry
i
ate
my
words
in
humblest
fashion
after
three
years
i
made
my
surrender
since
you
are
his
one
desire
mademoiselle
then
are
you
my
one
desire
i
bade
him
she
gave
her
hand
to
monsieur
sudden
tears
welling
over
her
lashes
monsieur
i
thought
i
had
no
friends
and
i
have
so
many
mademoiselle
the
king
cried
in
the
same
breath
fear
not
i
will
get
you
your
lover
if
i
sell
france
for
him
she
brushed
the
tears
away
and
smiled
on
him
i
have
no
fear
sire
with
you
and
de
quentin
to
save
him
i
can
have
no
fear
but
he
is
in
desperate
case
has
de
quentin
told
you
of
his
secretary
lucas
my
cousin
paul
de
lorraine
aye
said
the
king
it
is
a
dolourous
topic
very
painful
eh
rosny
i
do
not
shrink
from
my
pains
sire
de
rosny
answered
quietly
i
hold
myself
much
to
blame
in
this
matter
i
thought
i
knew
the
lucases
root
and
branch
i
did
not
discover
that
a
daughter
of
the
house
had
ever
been
a
friend
to
henri
de
guise
and
how
should
you
discover
it
the
king
demanded
he
had
made
the
attack
now
since
rosny
would
not
resent
it
he
rushed
himself
to
the
defence
how
were
you
to
dream
it
henri
de
guise
side
was
the
last
place
to
look
for
a
girl
of
the
religion
but
i
forgive
him
if
he
stole
a
rochelaise
we
have
avenged
it
deep
we
have
stolen
the
flower
of
lorraine
paul
lucas
paul
de
lorraine
she
went
on
eagerly
was
put
into
le
duc
house
to
kill
him
he
went
all
the
more
willingly
that
he
believed
de
mar
to
be
my
favoured
suitor
he
tried
to
draw
de
mar
into
the
scheme
to
ruin
him
he
failed
and
the
whole
plot
came
to
naught
i
have
learned
that
the
king
said
i
have
been
told
how
a
country
boy
stripped
his
mask
off
he
glanced
around
suddenly
at
me
where
i
stood
red
and
abashed
he
was
so
quick
that
he
grasped
everything
at
half
a
word
instantly
he
had
turned
to
the
lady
again
pray
continue
dear
mademoiselle
afterward
that
is
yesterday
paul
went
to
de
belin
and
swore
against
de
mar
that
he
had
murdered
a
lackey
in
his
house
in
the
rue
coupejarrets
the
lackey
was
murdered
there
but
paul
de
lorraine
did
it
the
man
knew
the
plot
paul
killed
him
to
stop
his
tongue
i
heard
him
confess
it
to
de
mayenne
i
and
this
félix
broux
were
in
the
oratory
and
heard
it
then
de
mar
was
arrested
not
then
the
officers
missed
him
he
came
to
our
house
dressed
as
an
italian
jeweller
with
a
case
of
trinkets
to
sell
madame
admitted
him
no
one
knew
him
but
me
and
my
on
the
way
out
mayenne
met
him
and
kept
him
while
he
chose
a
jewel
paul
de
lorraine
was
there
too
i
was
like
to
die
of
fear
i
went
in
to
de
mayenne
i
begged
him
to
come
out
with
me
to
supper
to
dismiss
the
tradespeople
that
i
might
talk
with
him
there
anything
but
it
availed
not
de
mayenne
spoke
freely
before
them
as
one
does
before
common
folk
presently
he
led
me
to
supper
paul
was
left
alone
with
de
mar
and
the
boy
he
recognized
them
he
was
armed
and
they
were
not
but
they
overbore
him
and
locked
him
up
in
the
closet
mordieu
mademoiselle
i
was
to
rescue
de
mar
for
your
sake
but
now
i
will
do
it
for
his
own
i
find
him
much
to
my
liking
he
came
away
clear
mademoiselle
aye
to
be
seized
in
the
street
by
the
governor
men
when
de
mayenne
found
how
he
had
been
tricked
sire
he
blazed
with
rage
i
warrant
he
did
the
king
answered
suppressing
however
in
deference
to
her
distress
his
desire
to
laugh
mademoiselle
forgive
me
if
this
amuses
me
here
at
denis
i
trow
it
was
not
amusing
in
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
he
sent
for
me
sire
she
went
on
blanching
at
the
memory
he
accused
me
of
shielding
de
mar
it
was
true
he
called
me
liar
traitor
wanton
he
said
i
was
false
to
my
house
to
my
bread
to
my
honour
he
said
i
had
smiling
lips
and
a
that
i
had
kissed
him
and
betrayed
him
i
had
given
him
my
promise
never
to
hold
intercourse
with
de
mar
again
i
had
given
my
word
to
be
true
to
my
house
de
mar
came
by
no
will
of
mine
i
had
no
inkling
of
such
purpose
till
i
beheld
him
before
madame
and
her
ladies
he
came
to
entreat
me
to
fly
to
wed
him
i
denied
him
sire
i
sent
him
away
but
was
i
to
say
to
the
guard
way
gentlemen
this
is
my
lover
mademoiselle
the
king
exclaimed
good
hap
that
you
have
turned
your
back
on
the
house
of
lorraine
here
if
we
are
but
rough
soldiers
we
know
how
to
tender
you
it
was
not
for
myself
i
came
she
said
more
quietly
my
lord
had
the
right
to
chasten
me
i
am
his
ward
and
i
did
deceive
him
but
while
he
foamed
at
me
came
word
of
de
mar
capture
then
mayenne
swore
he
should
pay
for
this
dear
he
said
he
should
be
found
guilty
of
the
murder
he
said
plenty
of
witnesses
would
swear
to
it
he
said
de
mar
should
be
tortured
to
make
him
confess
with
an
oath
monsieur
sprang
forward
aye
she
cried
starting
up
he
swore
de
mar
should
suffer
the
preparatory
and
the
previous
the
estrapade
and
the
brodekins
he
dare
not
the
king
shouted
mordieu
he
dare
not
sire
she
cried
you
can
promise
him
that
for
every
blow
he
strikes
étienne
de
mar
you
will
strike
me
two
mar
is
in
his
hands
but
i
am
in
yours
for
de
mar
unhurt
you
will
deliver
him
me
unhurt
if
he
torture
mar
you
will
torture
me
mademoiselle
the
king
cried
rather
shall
he
torture
every
chevalier
in
france
than
i
touch
a
hair
of
your
head
sire
the
word
died
away
in
a
sigh
like
a
snapt
rose
she
fell
at
his
feet
the
king
was
quick
but
monsieur
quicker
on
his
knees
beside
her
raising
her
head
on
his
arm
he
commanded
me
félix
the
door
at
the
back
bid
dame
verney
come
instantly
i
flew
and
was
back
to
find
him
risen
holding
mademoiselle
in
his
arms
her
hair
lay
loose
over
his
shoulder
like
a
rippling
flag
her
lashes
clung
to
her
cheeks
as
they
would
never
lift
more
quentin
his
majesty
was
saying
i
would
have
married
her
to
a
prince
but
since
she
wants
your
son
she
shall
have
him
if
i
storm
paris
and
as
monsieur
was
carrying
her
from
the
room
the
king
bent
over
and
kissed
her
mademoiselle
has
dropped
a
packet
from
her
dress
de
rosny
said
will
you
take
it
st
quentin
the
king
who
was
nearest
turned
to
pass
it
to
him
at
the
sight
of
it
he
uttered
his
dear
it
was
a
flat
oblong
packet
tied
about
with
common
twine
the
seal
cut
out
the
king
twitched
the
string
off
and
with
one
rapid
glance
at
the
papers
put
them
into
monsieur
hand
take
them
quentin
they
are
yours
xxix
two
mademoiselle
being
given
into
dame
verney
motherly
hands
gilles
and
i
were
ordered
to
repose
ourselves
on
the
skins
in
the
saddler
shop
lying
there
in
the
malodourous
gloom
i
could
see
the
crack
of
light
under
the
door
at
the
back
and
hear
between
gilles
snores
the
murmur
of
voices
the
king
and
his
gentlemen
were
planning
to
save
my
master
i
went
to
sleep
in
perfect
peace
at
daybreak
even
before
the
saddler
opened
the
shop
monsieur
routed
us
out
i
off
for
paris
lads
félix
comes
with
me
gilles
stays
to
guard
mademoiselle
i
felt
not
a
little
injured
deeming
that
i
whom
mademoiselle
knew
best
should
not
be
the
one
chosen
to
stay
by
her
but
the
sting
passed
quickly
after
all
paris
was
likely
to
be
more
exciting
than
denis
the
day
being
friday
we
delayed
not
to
eat
but
straightway
mounted
the
two
nags
that
a
sunburnt
béarn
pikeman
had
brought
to
the
door
as
we
walked
them
gently
across
the
square
which
at
this
rath
hour
we
alone
shared
with
the
twittering
birds
we
saw
coming
down
one
of
the
empty
streets
the
hurrying
figure
of
de
rosny
my
lord
drew
rein
at
once
you
are
no
slugabed
quentin
the
young
councillor
called
i
deserved
to
miss
you
fear
not
i
come
not
to
hinder
you
but
to
wish
you
now
this
is
kind
rosny
monsieur
answered
grasping
his
hand
the
more
that
you
do
approve
me
rosny
smiled
like
a
sudden
burst
of
sunshine
in
a
december
day
another
man
embrace
would
have
meant
less
i
approve
you
so
much
quentin
that
i
can
not
composedly
see
you
putting
your
head
into
the
lion
jaws
my
head
is
used
to
the
pillow
do
the
teeth
close
i
am
no
worse
off
than
my
son
your
death
makes
your
son
no
easier
why
what
else
to
do
rosny
monsieur
exclaimed
mishandle
the
lady
storm
paris
sell
the
cause
i
would
we
could
storm
paris
rosny
sighed
it
would
suit
me
better
to
seize
the
prisoner
than
to
sue
for
him
but
paris
is
not
ripe
for
us
yet
you
know
my
plan
to
send
to
villeroi
i
believe
he
could
manage
this
thing
i
am
second
to
none
monsieur
said
politely
in
my
admiration
of
de
villeroi
abilities
but
to
reach
him
is
uncertain
what
he
can
or
will
do
uncertain
étienne
de
mar
is
not
villeroi
son
he
is
mine
aye
it
is
your
business
rosny
assented
it
is
yours
to
take
your
way
a
mad
way
but
mine
but
come
now
rosny
you
must
admit
that
once
or
twice
when
all
your
wiseacres
were
deadlocked
my
madness
has
served
rosny
took
monsieur
hand
in
a
silent
grip
maximilien
the
duke
said
smiling
down
on
him
what
a
pity
you
are
a
scamp
of
a
heretic
henri
rosny
returned
gravely
i
would
you
had
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
born
in
the
religion
again
he
wished
us
and
we
gathered
up
our
reins
as
we
turned
the
corner
i
glanced
back
to
find
him
still
standing
as
we
had
left
him
gazing
soberly
after
us
the
man
who
was
going
into
the
lion
den
was
far
less
solemn
over
it
by
fits
and
starts
as
he
thought
on
his
son
great
danger
he
contrived
a
gloomy
countenance
but
monsieur
had
ridden
all
his
life
with
hope
on
the
pillion
she
did
not
desert
him
now
as
we
cantered
steadily
along
in
the
fresh
cool
morning
he
already
pictured
étienne
released
however
mad
he
acknowledged
his
errand
to
be
i
think
he
was
scarce
visited
by
a
doubt
of
its
success
it
was
impossible
to
him
that
his
son
should
not
be
saved
we
entered
with
perfect
ease
the
gate
of
paris
and
took
our
way
without
hesitancy
through
the
busiest
streets
nowhere
did
the
guard
spring
on
us
but
instead
more
than
once
the
gathered
in
knots
the
tradesmen
and
artisans
ran
out
of
their
shops
to
cheer
quentin
to
cheer
france
to
cheer
peace
to
cheer
to
the
echo
the
catholic
king
i
hope
mayenne
hears
them
monsieur
said
to
me
doffing
his
hat
to
a
big
farrier
who
had
come
out
of
his
smithy
waving
impudently
in
the
eye
of
all
the
world
the
white
flag
of
the
king
we
kept
a
brisk
pace
alike
where
they
cheered
us
and
where
in
other
streets
they
scowled
and
hooted
at
us
so
that
i
looked
out
for
men
with
pistols
in
windows
but
friend
or
foe
none
stopped
us
till
at
length
we
drew
rein
before
the
grilles
of
the
hôtel
de
lorraine
they
made
no
demur
at
admitting
us
monsieur
went
into
the
house
while
i
led
the
horses
to
the
stables
where
three
or
four
grooms
at
once
volunteered
to
rub
them
down
in
eagerness
to
pump
their
guardian
but
before
the
fellows
had
had
time
to
get
much
out
of
me
came
jean
marchand
all
unrecognizing
to
summon
me
indoors
i
followed
him
in
delight
partly
for
curiosity
partly
because
it
had
seemed
to
me
when
the
doorway
swallowed
monsieur
that
i
might
never
see
him
more
jean
ushered
me
into
the
where
monsieur
stood
alone
surprised
at
the
sight
of
me
a
lackey
came
for
me
i
said
look
monsieur
that
where
we
shut
up
lucas
i
ceased
hastily
for
i
knew
the
step
in
the
corridor
it
was
difficult
to
credit
mademoiselle
tale
to
believe
that
mayenne
could
ever
be
in
a
rage
in
he
came
big
and
calm
and
smiling
whatever
emotion
he
may
have
felt
at
monsieur
arrival
not
only
buried
but
with
a
blooming
over
it
he
greeted
his
guest
with
all
the
courteous
ease
of
an
unruffled
conscience
and
a
kindly
heart
not
till
his
glance
fell
on
me
did
he
show
any
sign
of
discomposure
what
you
he
exclaimed
brusquely
your
servant
brought
him
hither
monsieur
said
for
me
i
understood
that
one
of
your
gentlemen
had
come
with
you
i
sent
for
him
deeming
his
presence
might
conduce
to
your
ease
de
st
quentin
i
am
at
my
ease
de
mayenne
my
lord
answered
with
every
appearance
of
truth
you
may
go
félix
no
said
mayenne
since
he
is
here
he
may
stay
he
serves
the
purpose
as
well
as
another
he
did
not
say
what
the
purpose
was
nor
could
i
see
for
what
he
had
kept
me
unless
as
a
sign
to
monsieur
that
he
meant
to
play
fair
i
began
to
feel
somewhat
heartened
you
have
guessed
de
mayenne
my
errand
certainly
you
have
come
to
join
the
league
monsieur
laughed
out
on
the
contrary
de
mayenne
i
have
come
to
persuade
you
to
join
the
king
that
was
a
waste
of
my
friend
you
know
as
well
as
we
do
that
before
long
you
will
come
over
i
am
not
there
yet
nor
are
my
enemies
scattered
nor
is
the
league
dead
dying
my
lord
it
will
get
its
coup
de
grâce
o
sunday
when
the
king
goes
to
mass
quentin
mayenne
made
quiet
answer
when
i
am
in
such
case
that
nothing
remains
to
me
but
to
fall
on
my
sword
or
to
kneel
to
henry
be
assured
i
shall
kneel
to
henry
till
then
i
play
my
game
play
it
then
we
have
the
patience
to
wait
for
you
monsieur
be
assured
in
your
turn
that
when
you
do
come
on
your
knees
to
his
majesty
you
will
do
well
to
have
a
friend
or
two
at
court
morbleu
mayenne
cried
suddenly
showing
his
teeth
you
will
never
go
back
to
him
if
i
choose
to
stop
you
monsieur
raised
his
eyebrows
at
him
pained
by
the
unsuavity
of
course
not
monsieur
i
quite
understood
that
when
i
entered
the
gate
i
shall
never
leave
this
house
if
you
will
otherwise
you
will
leave
the
house
unharmed
mayenne
said
curtly
i
shall
not
treat
you
as
your
late
master
treated
my
brother
i
thank
your
generosity
monsieur
and
commend
your
good
sense
mayenne
looked
for
a
moment
as
if
he
repented
of
both
then
he
broke
into
a
laugh
one
permits
the
insolences
of
the
court
jester
monsieur
sprang
up
his
hand
on
his
sword
but
at
once
the
quick
flush
passed
from
his
face
and
he
too
laughed
mayenne
sat
as
he
was
in
somewhat
lowering
silence
my
duke
made
a
step
nearer
him
and
spoke
for
the
first
time
with
perfect
seriousness
my
lord
mayenne
it
was
no
outrecuidance
brought
me
here
this
morning
there
is
the
bastille
there
is
the
axe
i
know
that
my
course
has
been
offensive
to
you
your
nephew
proved
me
that
i
know
also
that
you
do
not
care
to
meddle
with
me
openly
at
least
you
have
not
meddled
whether
you
will
change
your
method
but
i
venture
to
believe
not
i
am
popular
just
now
in
paris
i
had
more
cheers
as
i
came
in
this
morning
than
have
met
your
ears
for
many
a
month
you
have
a
great
name
for
prudence
de
mayenne
i
believe
you
will
not
molest
me
i
hardly
thought
my
duke
was
making
a
great
name
for
prudence
but
then
as
he
said
he
had
to
work
in
his
own
way
mayenne
returned
with
chilling
calm
you
may
find
me
quentin
less
timid
than
you
suppose
impossible
mayenne
courage
is
unquestioned
i
rely
not
on
his
timidity
but
on
his
judgment
you
take
a
great
deal
upon
yourself
in
supposing
that
i
wanted
your
death
on
tuesday
and
do
not
want
it
on
friday
the
king
is
three
days
nearer
the
true
faith
than
on
tuesday
his
party
is
three
days
stronger
on
tuesday
it
would
have
been
a
blunder
to
kill
me
on
friday
it
is
three
days
worse
a
blunder
but
not
less
a
pleasure
i
have
had
something
of
the
kind
in
mind
ever
since
your
master
killed
my
brother
you
should
profit
by
that
murderer
experience
before
you
take
a
leaf
from
his
book
de
mayenne
henry
of
valois
gained
singularly
little
when
he
slew
guise
to
make
you
head
of
the
league
mayenne
started
and
then
laughed
to
show
his
scorn
of
the
flattery
but
i
think
he
was
all
the
same
half
pleased
none
the
less
because
he
knew
it
to
be
flattery
he
said
unexpectedly
your
son
comes
honestly
by
his
unbound
tongue
ah
my
son
now
that
you
mention
him
we
shall
discuss
him
a
little
you
have
put
my
son
monsieur
in
the
bastille
no
belin
and
my
nephew
paul
whom
you
know
have
put
him
there
but
de
mayenne
can
get
him
out
if
he
choose
if
he
choose
monsieur
sat
down
again
with
the
air
of
one
preparing
for
an
amiable
discussion
he
is
charged
with
the
murder
of
one
pontou
a
lackey
of
course
he
did
not
commit
it
nor
would
you
care
if
he
had
his
real
offence
is
making
love
to
your
ward
well
do
you
deny
it
not
the
love
but
the
offence
of
it
palpably
you
might
do
much
worse
than
dispose
of
the
lady
to
my
heir
i
might
do
much
better
than
bestow
my
time
on
you
if
that
is
all
you
have
to
say
we
have
hardly
opened
the
subject
de
mayenne
i
have
no
wish
to
carry
it
further
monsieur
the
king
ranks
afford
no
better
match
than
my
heir
no
maid
of
mine
shall
ever
marry
a
royalist
i
swore
no
son
of
mine
should
ever
marry
a
leaguer
but
i
have
come
to
see
the
error
of
my
ways
as
you
will
see
yours
mayenne
it
is
for
you
to
choose
where
among
the
king
forces
you
will
marry
mademoiselle
a
vague
uneasiness
a
fear
which
he
would
not
own
a
fear
crept
into
mayenne
eyes
he
studied
the
face
before
him
a
face
of
gay
challenge
and
said
at
length
not
quite
confidently
himself
you
speak
with
a
confidence
st
quentin
why
to
be
sure
mayenne
jumped
heavily
to
his
feet
what
mean
you
i
mean
that
mademoiselle
marrying
is
in
my
hands
where
is
your
ward
de
mayenne
mordieu
have
you
found
her
you
speak
sooth
in
your
hôtel
no
eager
kinsman
in
a
place
whither
you
can
not
follow
her
mayenne
looked
about
as
if
with
some
instinctive
idea
of
seeking
a
weapon
of
summoning
his
soldiers
by
god
throne
you
shall
tell
me
where
with
pleasure
she
is
at
st
denis
mayenne
cried
helplessly
as
numbed
under
a
blow
denis
but
how
how
came
she
there
on
foot
every
step
i
suppose
she
never
walked
two
streets
in
her
life
before
has
she
de
mayenne
but
she
tramped
to
denis
through
the
dark
to
knock
at
my
door
at
one
in
the
morning
mayenne
seized
monsieur
wrist
she
is
safe
quentin
she
is
safe
as
safe
monsieur
as
the
king
protection
can
make
her
pardieu
is
she
with
the
king
she
is
at
my
lodgings
in
the
care
of
the
saddler
wife
who
lets
them
i
left
a
staunch
man
in
charge
i
have
no
doubt
of
him
you
answer
for
her
safety
mayenne
cried
huskily
his
breath
coming
short
he
was
flushed
the
veins
in
his
forehead
corded
when
she
came
last
night
it
happened
that
the
king
was
there
monsieur
went
on
her
loveliness
and
her
misery
moved
him
to
the
heart
thousand
thunders
of
heaven
you
with
your
son
shall
be
hostages
for
her
safe
return
the
king
monsieur
went
on
as
immovably
as
mayenne
himself
at
his
best
with
that
warm
heart
of
his
pitying
beauty
in
distress
is
eager
for
mademoiselle
marriage
with
her
lover
mar
but
he
did
not
favour
my
venture
here
he
called
it
a
silly
business
he
said
you
would
clap
me
in
jail
and
he
told
me
flat
i
might
rot
my
life
out
there
before
he
would
give
up
to
you
mlle
de
montluc
well
then
pardieu
we
try
if
he
means
it
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
meant
it
the
quentins
out
of
the
way
there
is
valère
stout
kingsman
to
succeed
the
king
loses
little
then
are
you
gone
mad
that
you
put
yourself
in
my
grasp
i
was
never
saner
i
come
my
friend
to
make
you
listen
to
sanity
i
had
waited
from
moment
to
moment
mayenne
summons
to
his
soldiers
but
he
had
not
rung
and
now
he
flung
himself
down
again
in
his
what
to
your
understanding
is
sanity
if
you
send
me
to
join
my
son
monsieur
you
leave
mademoiselle
without
a
protector
friendless
penniless
in
the
midst
of
a
hostile
army
cursing
the
name
of
mayenne
have
you
reared
her
delicately
tenderly
for
that
mayenne
sat
silent
his
face
a
mask
it
was
impossible
to
tell
whether
the
shot
hit
monsieur
went
on
you
can
of
course
hold
us
in
durance
torture
us
kill
us
but
you
must
answer
for
it
to
the
people
of
paris
still
was
mayenne
silent
drumming
on
the
edge
of
the
table
finally
he
said
roughly
as
if
the
words
were
dragged
from
him
against
his
will
i
shall
not
torture
you
i
never
meant
to
torture
mar
the
arrest
was
not
my
work
since
it
was
done
i
meant
to
profit
by
it
to
keep
him
awhile
out
of
my
way
only
that
i
threatened
my
cousin
otherwise
in
heat
of
passion
but
i
shall
not
torture
him
i
shall
not
kill
him
monsieur
i
put
a
card
in
your
hand
mayenne
said
curtly
his
pride
ill
brooked
to
concede
the
point
but
he
could
not
have
it
supposed
that
he
did
not
see
what
he
was
doing
i
give
you
a
card
do
what
you
can
with
it
monsieur
you
show
what
little
surprises
me
knightly
generosity
it
is
to
that
generosity
i
appeal
is
the
horse
of
that
colour
but
now
you
were
frightening
my
prudence
ah
but
how
fortunate
the
man
to
whom
generosity
and
prudence
point
the
same
path
it
may
have
been
but
pretence
this
smiling
bonhomie
of
monsieur
mayenne
doubtless
gauged
it
as
such
but
at
any
rate
he
suffered
it
to
warm
him
he
regained
of
a
sudden
all
the
amiability
with
which
he
had
greeted
his
guest
smiling
and
calm
he
answered
quentin
i
care
little
for
either
your
threats
or
your
cajoleries
they
amuse
me
alike
and
move
me
not
but
i
have
a
care
for
my
sweet
cousin
since
you
threaten
me
with
her
danger
you
have
the
whiphand
now
it
was
monsieur
turn
to
sit
discreetly
silent
waiting
i
went
last
night
to
tell
the
child
i
would
not
harm
her
lover
lo
she
had
flown
i
had
a
regiment
searching
paris
for
her
i
was
in
the
streets
myself
till
dawn
monsieur
she
made
her
way
to
us
at
denis
to
offer
herself
to
our
torture
did
you
torture
mar
morbleu
mayenne
cried
half
rising
god
mercy
we
not
ruffians
out
there
i
tell
it
to
show
you
to
what
the
maid
was
strung
i
never
thought
it
great
matter
whom
one
married
mayenne
said
slowly
one
boy
is
much
like
another
i
should
have
mated
her
as
befitted
her
station
i
thought
she
would
be
happy
enough
and
she
was
good
about
it
i
did
not
see
how
deep
she
cared
she
was
docile
till
i
drove
her
too
hard
she
a
loving
child
you
are
fortunate
in
your
daughter
st
quentin
monsieur
sprang
up
radiant
advancing
on
him
mayenne
added
with
his
cool
smile
you
need
not
flatter
yourself
monsieur
that
it
is
your
doing
i
laugh
at
your
threats
sport
to
me
to
clap
you
behind
bars
to
say
to
your
king
to
the
mob
you
brag
of
now
get
him
out
then
cried
monsieur
i
must
value
my
sweet
daughter
more
than
ever
he
was
standing
over
mayenne
with
outstretched
hand
but
the
chief
delayed
taking
it
not
quite
so
fast
my
friend
if
i
yield
up
the
duc
de
quentin
the
comte
de
mar
and
mlle
lorance
de
montluc
i
demand
certain
little
concessions
for
myself
by
all
means
monsieur
you
stamp
us
churls
else
my
duke
sat
again
his
smile
a
shade
uneasy
which
mayenne
perceived
with
quiet
enjoyment
as
he
went
on
blandly
nothing
that
i
could
ask
of
you
de
quentin
could
equal
could
halve
what
i
give
still
that
the
knightliness
may
not
be
to
your
mortification
all
on
one
side
i
have
thought
of
something
for
you
to
grant
name
it
monsieur
another
point
in
your
favour
i
had
forgot
mayenne
observed
with
his
usual
reluctance
to
show
his
cards
even
when
the
time
had
come
to
spread
them
last
night
i
laid
on
this
table
a
packet
just
arrived
which
i
was
told
belonged
to
you
when
i
had
time
to
think
of
it
again
it
had
vanished
i
accused
my
lackeys
but
later
it
occurred
to
me
that
mlle
de
montluc
arming
for
battle
had
purloined
it
your
shrewdness
does
you
credit
you
see
you
have
scored
a
fourth
point
though
again
by
no
prowess
of
your
own
therefore
am
i
emboldened
to
demand
what
i
want
even
to
half
my
fortune
no
not
your
gear
save
that
for
your
béarnais
itching
palm
then
what
the
devil
is
it
you
want
you
will
not
get
my
name
in
the
league
i
am
glad
my
nephew
paul
bungled
that
affair
of
his
mayenne
went
on
at
his
own
pace
it
might
have
been
a
blunder
to
kill
you
it
had
certainly
been
a
pity
though
we
lorraines
have
two
murders
to
avenge
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
beginning
with
yours
you
are
wise
monsieur
i
am
after
all
a
harmless
creature
mayenne
laughed
natheless
have
you
done
your
best
here
in
paris
to
undermine
me
did
i
let
you
carry
on
your
little
works
unhindered
they
might
in
time
annoy
me
therefore
i
request
that
so
long
as
i
stay
in
paris
you
stay
out
oh
i
do
like
that
the
naïveté
amazed
while
it
amused
mayenne
possibly
not
but
you
will
consent
to
it
you
will
ride
out
of
my
court
when
we
have
finished
some
necessary
signing
of
papers
straight
to
the
denis
gate
and
you
will
pledge
me
your
honour
to
make
no
attempt
hereafter
to
enter
so
long
as
the
city
is
mine
mayenne
was
smiling
broadly
monsieur
frowning
he
relished
the
condition
little
he
was
enjoying
himself
much
in
paris
his
dangers
his
successes
his
biting
his
thumb
at
the
power
of
the
league
to
be
killed
at
his
post
was
nothing
but
to
be
bundled
away
from
it
to
inglorious
safety
that
stuck
in
his
gorge
for
a
moment
he
actually
hesitated
then
he
began
to
laugh
at
his
own
hesitation
well
ma
foi
what
do
i
expect
to
walk
a
rabbit
into
the
lion
den
and
make
my
own
terms
to
leo
i
am
happy
to
accept
yours
de
mayenne
especially
since
do
i
refuse
you
will
none
the
less
pack
me
off
you
mistake
quentin
you
are
welcome
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
days
with
me
in
the
bastille
or
in
the
league
the
former
is
preferable
you
may
count
yourself
thrice
fortunate
then
that
a
third
alternative
is
given

not
the
reminder
you
have
treated
me
as
a
prince
indeed
be
assured
the
quentins
will
not
forget
every
one
forgets
perhaps
but
when
you
need
our
good
offices
we
shall
not
have
had
time
to
forget
pardieu
quentin
you
have
good
courage
to
tell
me
to
my
head
my
course
is
run
my
dear
mayenne
none
punishes
the
maunderings
of
the
court
jester
monsieur
laughed
out
with
a
gay
gusto
after
a
moment
mayenne
laughed
too
my
duke
cried
quickly
rising
and
walking
the
length
of
the
table
to
his
host
you
have
dealt
with
me
munificently
mayenne
you
have
kept
back
but
one
thing
i
want
that
is
yourself
you
know
you
must
come
over
to
us
sooner
or
later
come
now
the
other
did
not
flame
out
at
monsieur
but
answered
coldly
i
have
no
taste
to
be
navarre
vassal
better
his
than
spain
mayenne
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
face
at
its
stolidest
well
i
am
no
astrologer
to
read
the
future
monsieur
laid
an
emphatic
hand
on
his
host
shoulder
but
i
read
it
my
friend
i
see
a
french
land
under
a
french
king
a
catholic
and
a
gallant
fellow
faithful
to
old
friends
friendly
to
old
foes
i
see
the
dear
land
at
peace
at
last
the
looms
humming
the
mills
clacking
wheat
growing
thick
on
the
mayenne
looked
up
with
a
grim
smile
i
have
still
a
field
or
two
to
water
for
that
wheat
my
compliments
to
your
new
master
quentin
you
may
tell
him
from
me
that
when
i
submit
i
submit
when
i
have
made
my
surrender
from
that
hour
forth
am
i
his
hound
to
lick
his
hand
to
guard
and
obey
him
till
then
let
him
beware
of
my
teeth
while
i
have
one
pikeman
to
my
back
one
sou
in
my
pouch
i
fight
my
cause
and
when
you
have
none
you
yet
have
three
pairs
of
hands
at
court
to
pull
you
up
out
of
the
mire
i
thank
their
graciousness
though
i
shall
never
need
their
offices
mayenne
said
grandly
he
stood
there
stately
and
proud
and
confident
the
picture
of
princeliness
and
strength
last
night
at
denis
it
had
seemed
to
me
that
no
power
could
defy
my
king
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
king
could
nick
the
power
of
my
lord
mayenne
when
suddenly
precisely
like
a
mummer
who
in
his
great
moment
winks
at
you
to
let
you
know
it
is
the
dignity
melted
into
a
smile
after
all
he
said
it
as
well
to
lay
an
anchor
to
windward
xxx
young
lord
settles
scores
with
two
foes
at
occupied
in
wrangling
with
the
grooms
over
the
merits
of
our
several
stables
with
the
soldiers
over
politics
and
the
armies
i
awaited
in
a
shady
corner
of
the
court
the
conclusion
of
formalities
i
had
just
declared
that
king
henry
would
be
in
paris
within
a
week
and
was
on
the
point
of
getting
my
crown
cracked
for
it
when
as
if
for
the
very
purpose
save
the
mark
of
rescuing
me
entered
from
the
street
lucas
he
approached
rapidly
eyes
straight
in
front
of
him
heeding
us
no
whit
but
all
the
loungers
turned
to
stare
at
him
even
then
he
paid
no
heed
passing
us
without
a
glance
but
the
tall
bespoke
him
de
lorraine
any
news
he
started
and
turned
to
us
in
surprise
as
if
he
had
not
known
of
our
presence
nor
indeed
quite
realized
it
now
he
was
both
pale
and
rumpled
like
one
who
has
not
closed
an
eye
all
night
any
news
here
he
made
norman
answer
no
monsieur
unless
his
grace
has
information
we
have
heard
nothing
and
the
woman
sticks
to
it
mademoiselle
told
her
never
a
word
lucas
stood
still
his
eyes
travelling
dully
over
the
group
of
us
as
if
he
expected
somewhere
to
find
help
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
in
the
least
thinking
of
us
he
looked
straight
at
me
for
a
full
minute
before
he
awoke
to
my
identity
you
yes
de
lorraine
i
said
with
all
the
respectfulness
i
could
muster
which
may
not
have
been
much
considering
our
parting
i
was
ready
for
any
violence
but
after
the
first
moment
of
startlement
he
regarded
me
in
a
singularly
way
while
he
inquired
without
apparent
resentment
how
i
came
there
with
le
duc
de
quentin
i
grinned
at
him
we
and
de
mayenne
are
friends
now
i
could
not
rouse
him
even
to
curiosity
it
seemed
but
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
men
with
more
life
than
he
had
yet
shown
you
not
told
this
fellow
we
understand
our
orders
monsieur
answered
a
bit
huffed
now
this
was
eminently
the
place
for
me
to
hold
my
tongue
but
of
course
i
could
not
they
had
no
need
to
tell
me
de
lorraine
i
know
quite
well
what
the
trouble
is
i
know
rather
more
about
it
than
you
do
yourself
he
confronted
me
now
with
all
the
fire
i
could
ask
what
mean
you
whelp
i
mean
mademoiselle
what
else
should
i
mean
what
do
you
know
everything
her
whereabouts
her
whereabouts
he
had
his
hand
to
his
knife
by
this
i
abated
somewhat
of
my
drawl
to
say
still
airily
go
ask
de
quentin
he
here
he
be
so
glad
to
see
you
here
certes
he
closeted
now
with
de
mayenne
they
thicker
than
brothers
go
see
for
yourself
lucas
where
is
mademoiselle
safe
she
to
marry
the
comte
de
mar
he
stared
at
me
for
one
moment
weighing
whether
this
could
be
true
then
without
further
parley
he
shot
into
the
house
is
that
true
demanded
their
tongues
loosened
now
they
flooded
me
with
questions
concerning
mademoiselle
which
i
answered
warily
as
i
could
heartily
repenting
me
by
this
of
baiting
lucas
no
good
could
come
of
it
he
might
even
turn
mayenne
from
his
bargain
upset
all
our
triumph
i
hardly
heard
what
the
soldiers
said
to
me
i
was
almost
nervous
enough
wild
enough
to
dash
after
him
but
that
was
no
help
i
stayed
where
i
was
fevered
with
anxiety
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
he
came
out
of
the
house
again
and
without
a
glance
at
us
went
straight
through
the
gate
with
the
step
and
air
of
a
man
who
knows
what
he
is
about
i
was
no
easier
in
my
mind
though
i
saw
him
gone
soon
on
his
steps
came
a
lackey
to
order
de
quentin
horses
and
two
musketeers
to
mount
and
ride
with
him
on
reaching
the
door
with
the
nags
i
discovered
i
was
not
to
be
of
the
party
our
second
steed
must
carry
gear
of
mademoiselle
and
her
handwoman
a
peasant
silent
as
a
stone
though
the
men
quizzed
her
asking
if
she
were
glad
to
get
to
her
mistress
again
whether
she
had
known
all
this
time
the
lady
whereabouts
she
answered
no
single
word
but
busied
herself
seeing
the
horse
loaded
to
her
notion
presently
in
the
guidance
of
pierre
monsieur
appeared
you
stay
félix
and
go
to
the
bastille
for
your
master
then
you
will
wait
at
the
denis
gate
for
vigo
with
horses
is
all
right
monsieur
i
had
to
ask
as
i
held
his
stirrup
is
all
right
lucas
his
face
had
been
a
little
clouded
as
he
came
down
the
stairs
and
now
it
darkened
more
but
he
answered
quite
right
achates
de
mayenne
stands
to
his
word
lucas
availed
nothing
he
stood
a
moment
frowning
then
his
countenance
cleared
up
my
faith
i
have
enough
to
gladden
me
without
fretting
that
lucas
is
alive
fare
you
well
félix
you
are
like
to
reach
denis
as
soon
as
i
my
son
horse
will
not
lag
he
sprang
to
the
saddle
with
a
smiling
salute
to
his
guardians
and
the
little
train
clattered
off
pierre
came
to
my
elbow
with
an
open
paper
the
order
signed
and
sealed
for
de
mar
release
here
my
young
cockerel
you
and
are
to
take
this
to
the
bastille
and
it
will
be
strange
if
your
master
does
not
walk
free
again
his
grace
bids
you
tell
de
mar
he
remembers
wednesday
night
underground
and
i
remember
tuesday
night
in
the
pierre
i
was
beginning
but
he
cut
me
short
even
now
that
i
was
in
favour
he
risked
no
mention
of
his
disobedience
he
packed
me
off
with
on
the
instant
i
had
no
chance
to
ask
him
whether
he
suspected
us
yesterday
sometimes
i
have
thought
he
did
but
i
am
bound
to
say
he
gave
us
no
look
to
show
it
and
i
walked
straight
across
paris
to
the
bastille
it
seemed
a
little
way
before
the
potent
name
of
mayenne
bars
flew
open
a
sentry
on
guard
in
the
court
led
us
into
a
small
room
all
stone
floor
walls
ceiling
where
sat
at
the
table
some
high
official
perhaps
the
governor
of
the
prison
himself
he
was
an
old
campaigner
grizzled
and
his
right
sleeve
hanging
empty
an
interesting
figure
no
doubt
but
i
paid
him
scant
attention
for
at
his
side
stood
lucas
i
come
on
de
mayenne
business
he
was
expostulating
vehement
yet
civil
i
suppose
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
write
the
order
since
you
know
me
the
regulations
de
lorraine
the
officer
broke
off
to
demand
of
our
escort
well
what
now
i
went
straight
up
to
him
not
waiting
permission
and
held
out
my
paper
an
order
if
it
please
you
monsieur
for
the
comte
de
mar
release
lucas
hand
went
out
to
snatch
and
crumple
it
then
his
clenched
fist
dropped
to
his
side
it
seemed
as
if
his
eyes
would
blacken
the
paper
with
their
fire
just
that
the
requisition
for
de
mar
release
the
officer
told
him
looking
up
from
it
all
perfectly
regular
and
in
order
in
five
minutes
de
lorraine
the
comte
de
mar
shall
be
before
you
you
may
have
all
the
conversation
you
wish
lucas
face
was
as
blank
as
the
wall
i
am
a
soldier
and
a
soldier
orders
must
be
obeyed
the
officer
went
on
to
explain
evidently
not
caring
to
offend
the
general
nephew
without
the
written
order
i
could
not
admit
your
brother
of
guise
but
now
you
can
have
all
the
conversation
you
desire
with
de
mar
lucas
face
did
not
change
save
to
scowl
at
the
very
name
of
his
brother
guise
he
said
curtly
no
i
must
get
back
to
his
grace
and
barely
bowing
went
from
the
room
now
i
do
make
that
out
the
keeper
muttered
in
his
beard
that
lucas
should
be
in
one
moment
cured
of
his
urgent
need
of
seeing
the
comte
de
mar
was
too
much
for
him
but
no
riddle
to
me
i
knew
he
had
come
to
stab
étienne
in
his
cell
it
was
his
last
chance
and
he
had
missed
it
i
feared
him
no
longer
for
i
believed
in
mayenne
faith
my
master
once
released
lucas
could
not
hurt
him
what
was
as
much
to
the
point
the
officer
had
no
doubt
of
good
faith
he
went
with
his
paper
into
an
inner
room
where
we
caught
sight
through
the
door
of
big
books
with
a
clerk
or
two
behind
them
and
in
a
moment
appeared
again
with
a
key
since
the
young
gentleman
a
count
i
do
turnkey
office
myself
he
said
his
grim
old
battlement
of
a
face
smiling
this
was
our
day
from
mayenne
down
everybody
went
out
of
his
way
to
pleasure
us
i
was
suddenly
emboldened
by
his
manner
monsieur
perhaps
it
is
preposterous
to
ask
but
might
i
go
with
you
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
surprised
well
after
all
why
not
you
too
sir
musketeer
an
you
like
so
the
three
of
us
he
and
and
i
went
to
rescue
the
comte
de
mar
we
passed
through
corridor
after
corridor
row
after
row
of
doors
the
deeper
we
penetrated
the
mighty
pile
the
fonder
i
grew
of
my
friend
mayenne
by
whose
complaisance
none
of
these
doors
would
shut
on
me
we
climbed
at
last
a
steep
turret
stair
winding
about
a
huge
fir
trunk
lighted
by
slits
of
windows
in
the
wall
and
at
the
top
turned
down
a
dark
passage
to
a
door
at
the
end
the
bolts
of
which
invisible
to
me
in
the
gloom
the
veteran
drew
back
with
familiar
hand
the
cell
was
small
with
one
high
window
through
which
i
could
see
naught
but
the
sky
for
all
furniture
it
contained
a
pallet
a
stool
a
bench
that
might
serve
as
table
étienne
stood
at
the
window
his
arm
crooked
around
the
iron
bars
gazing
out
over
the
roofs
of
paris
he
wheeled
about
at
the
door
creaking
i
go
to
trial
monsieur
he
asked
quickly
not
seeing
me
behind
the
keeper
no
le
comte
the
charge
is
cancelled
i
come
to
set
you
free
i
dashed
in
past
the
officer
snatching
my
lord
hand
to
kiss
it
true
monsieur
you
free
it
all
settled
with
mayenne
monsieur
seen
him
he
sets
you
free
he
said
recognizance
of
wednesday
night
incredulous
joy
flashed
over
his
face
to
give
way
to
belief
without
joy
now
i
know
she
married
nothing
of
the
sort
i
fairly
shouted
at
him
dancing
up
and
down
in
my
eagerness
she
to
marry
le
comte
she
at
denis
with
monsieur
she
to
marry
you
it
all
arranged
mayenne
consents
the
king
everybody
it
all
settled
she
marries
you
preposterous
as
it
seemed
he
could
not
discredit
my
fervour
he
followed
us
out
of
the
cell
and
through
the
fortress
in
a
radiant
daze
he
half
believed
himself
dreaming
i
think
and
feared
to
speak
lest
his
happiness
should
melt
i
fancied
even
that
he
walked
lightly
and
gingerly
as
if
the
slightest
unwary
movement
might
break
the
spell
not
till
we
were
actually
in
the
open
door
of
the
court
face
to
face
with
freedom
did
he
rouse
himself
to
acknowledge
the
thing
real
with
a
joyous
laugh
he
turned
to
the
keeper
de
la
motte
you
should
employ
your
leisure
in
writing
down
your
reflections
like
the
chevalier
de
montaigne
you
could
give
us
a
trenchant
essay
on
the
ingratitude
of
man
here
are
you
host
of
the
biggest
inn
in
paris
a
pile
more
imposing
than
the
louvre
itself
your
hospitality
is
so
eager
that
you
insist
on
entertaining
me
so
lavish
that
you
lodge
me
for
nothing
would
keep
me
without
a
murmur
till
the
end
of
my
life
yet
i
ingrate
that
i
am
depart
without
a
thank
you
they
do
leave
in
such
case
that
they
can
very
well
thank
me
most
of
my
guests
la
motte
answered
with
a
dry
smile
you
are
a
fortunate
man
de
mar
le
comte
will
you
come
quietly
with
me
to
the
denis
gate
asked
him
or
must
i
borrow
a
guard
from
de
la
motte
étienne
whole
face
was
smiling
not
his
lips
alone
but
his
eyes
even
his
skin
and
hair
seemed
to
have
taken
on
a
brighter
look
he
glanced
at
in
surprise
at
the
absurd
question
i
will
come
like
a
lamb
le
mousquetaire
we
saluted
la
motte
and
walked
merrily
out
into
the
place
bastille
i
think
i
never
felt
so
grand
as
when
i
passed
through
the
noble
the
soldiers
making
no
motion
to
hinder
us
but
all
saluting
as
if
we
owned
the
place
it
had
its
advantage
this
making
friends
with
mayenne
the
first
thing
my
lord
did
still
in
the
shadow
of
the
prison
was
to
come
to
terms
with
see
here
my
friend
why
must
you
put
yourself
to
the
fatigue
of
escorting
me
to
the
gate
orders
monsieur
the
wants
to
know
that
you
get
into
no
mischief
between
here
and
the
gate
you
are
banished
you
understand
from
paris
i
pledge
you
my
word
i
shall
make
no
attempt
to
elude
my
fate
i
go
straight
to
the
gate
but
with
all
politeness
to
you
sir
musketeer
i
could
dispense
with
your
company
i
am
a
soldier
and
a
soldier
orders
must
be
obeyed
quoted
the
keeper
words
which
seemed
to
have
impressed
him
however
le
comte
if
i
had
something
to
look
at
i
could
walk
ten
paces
behind
you
and
look
at
it
oh
if
it
is
a
question
of
something
to
play
with
étienne
laughed
was
provided
with
toys
and
étienne
linked
arms
with
me
the
soldier
out
of
behind
us
he
followed
till
we
were
in
the
rue
denis
when
waving
his
hand
in
farewell
he
turned
his
steps
with
the
pious
consciousness
of
duty
done
only
i
looked
back
to
see
it
monsieur
had
forgotten
his
existence
i
am
not
proud
i
do
mind
being
marched
through
the
streets
by
a
musketeer
étienne
explained
as
we
started
but
i
ca
talk
before
him
tell
me
félix
the
story
if
you
would
have
me
live
and
i
told
him
till
we
almost
ran
blindly
into
the
tower
of
the
denis
gate
we
learned
of
the
warder
that
de
quentin
had
recently
passed
out
but
that
nothing
had
been
seen
of
his
equery
no
steeds
were
here
for
us
well
then
we
go
have
a
glass
but
if
vigo
does
come
soon
by
my
faith
i
walk
to
st
denis
but
that
promised
glass
was
never
drunk
nor
were
we
to
set
out
at
once
for
denis
for
in
the
door
of
the
we
met
lucas
i
had
dismissed
him
from
thought
as
something
out
of
the
reckoning
dead
and
done
with
powerless
as
yesterday
broken
sword
i
thought
him
gone
out
of
our
lives
when
he
went
out
of
prison
gone
forever
like
last
year
snow
and
here
within
the
hour
we
encountered
him
a
naked
sword
in
his
hand
a
smile
on
his
lips
he
said
in
the
flower
of
his
easy
insolence
tuesday
i
told
you
our
hour
would
come
it
is
here
at
your
service
quoth
my
lord
then
it
needs
not
to
slap
your
face
you
insult
me
safely
lucas
you
have
but
one
life
that
is
forfeit
be
you
courteous
you
think
so
i
know
it
lucas
held
out
the
bare
sword
hilt
toward
us
monsieur
had
a
box
for
weapon
yesterday
but
as
i
prefer
to
fight
in
the
established
way
i
ventured
to
provide
him
with
a
sword
thoughtful
of
you
lucas
is
this
the
make
of
sword
you
elect
to
be
killed
with
he
was
bending
the
blade
to
try
its
temper
lucas
unsheathed
his
own
de
mar
may
have
his
choice
de
mar
professed
himself
satisfied
with
the
blade
given
him
have
you
summoned
your
seconds
lucas
lucas
raised
his
eyebrows
is
that
necessary
i
thought
we
might
settle
our
affairs
without
delay
i
confess
myself
impatient
your
sentiments
for
once
are
mine
it
is
understood
you
bring
your
spaniel
with
you
he
will
watch
that
i
do
not
spring
on
you
before
you
are
ready
lucas
said
with
a
fine
sneer
and
who
is
to
watch
me
oh
monsieur
chivalry
is
notorious
precautions
are
unnecessary
it
is
your
privilege
monsieur
to
appoint
the
happy
spot
the
spot
is
near
at
hand
where
you
slew
pontou
is
the
fitting
place
for
you
to
die
it
is
fitting
for
you
to
die
in
your
own
house
lucas
amended
without
further
parley
we
turned
into
the
rue
des
innocents
on
our
way
to
that
of
the
coupejarrets
now
i
had
been
on
the
watch
from
the
first
instant
for
foul
play
i
had
suspected
something
wrong
with
the
sword
but
my
lord
who
knew
had
accepted
it
then
when
lucas
proposed
no
seconds
i
had
felt
sure
of
a
trap
but
his
inviting
my
presence
at
the
place
of
our
choice
smelt
like
honesty
étienne
remarked
casually
to
me
faith
there
soon
be
as
many
ghosts
in
the
house
as
you
thought
you
saw
there
grammont
pontou
and
now
lucas
what
ails
you
lad
footsteps
on
your
grave
but
it
was
not
thoughts
of
my
grave
caused
the
shudder
but
of
his
for
of
the
three
men
of
the
the
third
was
not
lucas
but
étienne
what
if
the
vision
were
after
all
the
thing
i
had
at
first
believed
it
a
portent
an
appearance
not
of
those
who
had
died
by
steel
but
of
those
who
must
one
two
and
now
the
third
next
moment
i
almost
laughed
out
in
relief
it
was
not
pontou
i
had
seen
but
louis
martin
and
he
was
living
the
vision
was
no
omen
but
a
mere
happening
was
i
a
babe
to
shiver
so
and
yet
martin
if
not
dead
was
like
to
die
he
was
in
duress
as
a
leaguer
spy
to
await
king
henry
will
all
who
entered
this
house
lay
under
a
curse
we
should
none
of
us
pass
out
again
save
to
our
tombs
we
entered
the
little
passage
the
court
where
shards
of
glass
still
strewed
the
pavement
some
one
the
gendarmes
i
fancy
when
they
took
away
pontou
had
put
a
heavy
padlock
on
the
door
lucas
and
grammont
left
swinging
we
go
in
by
your
postern
félix
my
master
said
lucas
i
confess
i
prefer
that
you
go
first
lucas
put
his
back
to
the
wall
why
go
farther
le
comte
do
you
long
for
interruption
we
were
not
noticed
coming
in
the
street
was
quiet
he
crossed
the
court
abruptly
and
went
down
the
alley
to
look
into
the
street
not
a
soul
in
sight
he
said
coming
back
i
think
we
shall
not
be
interrupted
still
it
is
wise
to
use
every
care
we
will
fight
if
you
like
in
the
house
he
opened
with
his
knife
the
fastened
shutter
and
leaped
lightly
in
monsieur
followed
i
the
last
was
for
closing
the
shutter
but
he
stopped
me
no
leave
it
wide
i
have
no
fancy
for
a
walk
in
with
m
lucas
do
we
fight
here
lucas
asked
facing
us
in
the
wide
square
hall
we
can
let
in
more
light
you
seem
anxious
my
friend
to
call
attention
to
your
whereabouts
as
i
am
host
i
designate
the
if
you
please
i
suppose
you
insist
on
my
walking
first
lucas
sneered
i
request
it
monsieur
with
all
the
willingness
in
the
world
his
answered
setting
foot
straightway
on
the
stair
and
mounting
steadily
never
turning
to
see
how
near
we
followed
or
what
we
did
with
our
hands
his
trust
made
me
ashamed
of
our
lack
of
it
i
almost
believed
we
did
him
injustice
yet
at
heart
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
credit
him
with
any
fair
dealing
we
went
up
one
flight
up
two
we
had
left
behind
us
the
twilight
of
the
lower
story
had
not
reached
dawn
again
at
the
top
we
walked
in
blackness
suddenly
i
halted
monsieur
what
i
heard
a
noise
of
course
you
did
the
place
is
full
of
rats
it
was
no
rat
it
was
footsteps
we
all
three
held
still
there
monsieur
do
you
hear
nothing
félix
your
teeth
are
chattering
cross
yourself
and
come
on
but
i
could
not
stand
it
i
go
back
and
see
monsieur
no
lucas
said
striding
back
from
the
foot
of
the
next
flight
i
will
go
we
saw
a
glint
in
the
gloom
monsieur
bared
sword
you
will
go
neither
one
of
you
hush
if
we
show
ourselves
there
be
no
duel
we
kept
still
all
three
leaning
over
the
banister
peering
down
to
where
the
white
tiles
picked
themselves
out
of
the
floor
of
the
hall
far
beneath
we
could
see
them
better
than
we
could
see
one
another
all
was
silent
not
so
much
as
a
rustle
came
up
from
below
suddenly
lucas
made
a
step
or
two
as
if
to
pass
us
étienne
wheeled
about
raising
his
sword
toward
the
spot
where
from
his
footfalls
we
supposed
lucas
to
be
you
show
an
eagerness
to
get
away
from
me
de
lorraine
not
in
the
least
de
mar
this
alarm
is
but
félix
poltroonery
yet
it
prompts
me
to
go
down
and
close
the
shutter
on
the
contrary
you
will
go
up
with
me
félix
will
close
the
shutter
they
confronted
each
other
vague
shapes
in
the
darkness
each
with
drawn
sword
then
lucas
raised
his
in
salute
as
you
will
so
be
some
one
sees
to
it
go
félix
lucas
first
they
mounted
the
last
flight
of
stairs
and
their
footsteps
passed
along
the
corridor
to
the
room
at
the
back
i
as
i
was
ordered
set
my
face
down
the
stairs
they
might
mock
me
as
they
liked
but
i
could
not
get
it
out
of
my
head
that
i
had
heard
steps
below
cautiously
with
a
thumping
heart
i
stole
from
stair
to
stair
pausing
at
the
bottom
of
the
flight
i
heard
plainly
the
sound
of
moving
above
me
and
of
voices
but
below
not
a
whisper
not
a
creak
it
must
have
been
my
silly
fears
resolved
to
choke
them
i
planted
my
feet
boldly
on
the
next
flight
and
descended
humming
to
prove
my
ease
the
rollicky
tune
of
peyrot
catch
suddenly
from
not
three
feet
off
came
the
soft
singing
my
love
and
folly
my
knees
knocked
together
and
the
breath
fluttered
in
my
throat
it
seemed
the
darkness
itself
had
given
tongue
then
came
a
low
laugh
and
the
muttered
words
here
we
are
de
lorraine
are
you
ready
there
was
a
stir
of
feet
on
the
landing
before
me
behind
the
voice
the
house
then
was
full
of
lucas
cutthroats
the
first
of
them
peyrot
in
the
height
of
my
terror
i
remembered
that
étienne
life
too
depended
on
my
wits
and
i
kept
them
i
whispered
for
whispering
voices
are
hard
to
tell
apart
not
yet
the
two
of
them
are
up
there
keep
quiet
and
i
send
the
boy
down
when
you
finished
him
come
up
as
you
say
monsieur
it
is
your
job
i
turned
scarce
able
to
believe
my
luck
and
not
daring
to
run
walked
again
prick
my
ears
as
i
might
i
heard
no
movement
after
me
actually
i
had
fooled
peyrot
i
had
gone
down
to
meet
my
death
and
a
tune
had
saved
me
when
i
reached
the
uppermost
landing
i
rushed
along
the
passage
and
into
the
room
flinging
the
door
shut
locking
and
bolting
it
they
had
not
begun
to
fight
but
had
busied
themselves
clearing
the
space
of
all
obstacles
the
table
was
pushed
against
the
wall
in
the
corner
by
the
door
the
chairs
were
heaped
one
on
another
at
the
end
of
the
room
both
shutters
were
wide
open
étienne
bareheaded
in
his
shirt
stood
at
guard
lucas
was
kneeling
on
the
floor
picking
up
with
scrupulous
care
some
bits
of
a
broken
plate
he
sprang
to
his
feet
at
sight
of
me
what
is
it
cried
étienne
cutthroats
they
be
here
in
a
minute
even
as
i
spoke
i
heard
tramping
on
the
stairs
below
my
slam
of
the
door
had
warned
them
that
something
was
wrong
was
that
your
delay
étienne
shouted
springing
at
his
foe
i
play
to
win
lucas
answered
smiling
the
blades
met
the
men
circled
about
and
about
lucas
though
he
preferred
to
murder
knew
how
to
duel
we
were
doomed
with
monsieur
sword
for
only
weapon
we
could
never
hope
to
pass
the
gang
in
another
minute
they
would
be
here
to
batter
the
door
down
and
end
us
our
consolation
lay
in
killing
lucas
first
yet
as
i
watched
i
feared
that
étienne
in
the
brief
moments
that
remained
to
him
could
not
conquer
him
so
shrewd
and
strong
was
fence
must
the
scoundrel
win
i
started
forward
to
play
pontou
trick
lucas
sought
to
murder
us
why
not
we
him
one
flash
from
my
lord
eyes
and
i
retreated
in
despair
for
i
knew
that
did
i
touch
lucas
étienne
would
let
fall
his
sword
let
lucas
kill
him
and
the
bravos
were
on
the
last
flight
was
there
no
escape
there
were
three
doors
in
the
room
one
led
to
the
passage
one
to
the
closet
the
third
i
dashed
through
to
find
myself
in
a
large
empty
chamber
a
door
wide
open
giving
on
the
passage
through
it
i
could
see
the
dusky
figures
of
four
men
running
up
the
stairs
i
was
across
the
room
like
an
arrow
and
got
the
door
shut
and
bolted
before
they
could
reach
the
landing
the
next
moment
some
one
flung
against
it
it
stood
firm
delaying
only
a
moment
to
shake
it
three
of
the
four
i
could
hear
run
to
the
farther
door
whence
issued
the
noise
of
the
swords
i
inside
the
wall
ran
back
too
the
combat
still
raged
neither
that
i
could
see
had
gained
the
least
advantage
outside
the
murderers
dashed
themselves
upon
the
door
i
dragged
at
the
heavy
table
and
with
a
strength
that
amazed
myself
pushed
and
pulled
it
before
the
door
it
would
make
the
panels
a
little
firmer
was
there
no
escape
none
i
ran
once
more
into
the
second
chamber
its
shutters
were
closed
i
threw
them
open
there
was
no
other
door
to
the
room
no
there
was
a
chimney
but
spanned
a
foot
above
the
fireplace
by
two
iron
bars
the
thinnest
sweep
that
ever
wielded
broom
could
not
have
squeezed
between
them
in
despair
i
ran
to
the
window
again
top
of
the
house
as
it
was
i
thought
i
would
sooner
leap
than
be
stabbed
to
death
i
stuck
my
head
out
it
was
the
same
window
where
i
had
stood
when
grammont
seized
me
there
not
ten
feet
away
eight
at
the
most
but
a
little
above
me
was
the
casement
of
my
garret
in
the
amour
de
dieu
would
it
be
possible
to
jump
and
catch
the
sill
if
i
did
i
could
scarce
pull
myself
in
i
looked
below
me
there
swung
the
sign
of
the
amour
de
dieu
and
there
beside
it
stood
a
homespun
figure
surely
known
to
me
there
was
no
mistaking
that
bald
pate
i
yelled
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
maître
jacques
he
looked
up
gaping
at
this
voice
out
of
the
sky
but
despite
his
amazement
i
saw
that
he
knew
me
maître
jacques
we
being
murdered
we
ca
get
out
help
us
for
the
love
of
christ
bring
a
plank
a
rope
to
the
window
there
for
an
instant
he
stood
confounded
then
he
vanished
into
the
inn
i
waited
on
fire
still
from
the
next
room
sounded
the
clash
of
steel
white
shirt
and
black
doublet
passed
the
door
in
turn
unflagging
ungaining
suddenly
came
a
new
noise
from
the
passage
of
trampling
and
rending
blows
and
oaths
my
first
thought
was
that
they
were
fighting
out
there
that
rescuers
had
come
then
as
i
listened
i
learned
better
despairing
of
kicking
down
the
door
they
were
tearing
out
a
piece
of
for
a
it
would
not
long
stand
against
that
i
ran
back
to
the
window
no
jacques
appeared
we
were
lost
lost
hark
from
the
next
room
a
cry
a
fall
well
were
it
lucas
victory
he
might
kill
me
as
well
as
another
i
walked
into
the
back
room
but
it
was
lucas
who
lay
prone
come
come
i
cried
clutching
monsieur
wrist
but
he
would
not
till
with
lucas
own
misericorde
he
had
given
him
coup
de
grâce
crash
crash
the
upper
panel
shivered
in
twain
a
great
splinter
six
inches
wide
hanging
from
the
top
blocked
the
opening
a
hand
came
through
to
wrench
it
away
étienne
across
the
room
at
a
leap
drove
his
knife
through
the
hand
nailing
it
to
the
wood
on
the
instant
he
recognized
its
owner
good
morning
peyrot
we
recovered
the
packet
not
waiting
for
further
amenities
i
seized
my
lord
and
dashed
him
into
the
front
room
only
a
faint
hope
to
lead
me
but
the
oaths
of
the
bravos
a
good
spur
and
quentin
be
thanked
there
in
the
garret
window
were
jacques
and
his
tapsters
pushing
a
ladder
to
us
go
monsieur
there
are
four
behind
us
go
you
first
but
i
who
had
snatched
up
his
sword
as
he
stabbed
lucas
ran
back
to
guard
the
door
he
had
the
sense
to
see
there
was
no
good
arguing
crying
quick
after
me
félix
he
crawled
out
on
the
ladder
peyrot
was
released
another
blow
from
the
ram
and
the
door
fell
to
finders
they
leaped
in
over
the
table
like
a
freshet
over
a
dam
i
darted
to
the
window
étienne
was
in
the
garret
helping
hold
the
ladder
for
me
i
flung
myself
upon
it
all
too
eagerly
like
a
lath
it
snapped
xxxi
the
very
pattern
of
a
king
the
next
world
appeared
to
be
strangely
like
this
i
found
myself
lying
on
a
straw
bed
in
a
little
low
attic
my
head
resting
comfortably
on
some
one
shoulder
while
some
one
else
poured
wine
down
my
gullet
presently
i
discovered
that
maître
jacques
was
the
ministering
hand
étienne
the
shoulder
after
all
this
was
not
heaven
but
still
paris
i
had
no
desire
to
speak
so
long
as
the
flow
of
old
jacques
best
burgundy
continued
but
when
he
saw
my
eyes
wide
open
he
stopped
and
i
said
my
voice
to
my
surprise
very
faint
and
quavery
what
happened
dear
brave
lad
you
fainted
my
lord
voice
was
as
unsteady
as
mine
but
the
ladder
i
murmured
the
ladder
broke
but
you
had
hold
beyond
the
break
you
hung
on
till
we
seized
you
and
then
you
swooned
what
a
baby
i
said
getting
to
my
feet
but
the
men
monsieur
peyrot
i
think
we
seen
the
last
of
those
worthies
they
took
to
their
heels
when
you
escaped
them
but
monsieur
they
gone
to
inform
you
be
taken
for
killing
lucas
i
doubt
it
themselves
smell
too
strong
of
blood
to
dare
bruit
the
matter
natheless
if
you
can
walk
now
we
make
good
time
to
the
gate
but
for
all
his
haste
he
would
not
start
till
i
had
had
some
bread
and
soup
down
in
the
kitchen
we
must
take
good
care
of
you
boy
félix
he
said
for
where
the
quentins
would
be
without
you
i
tremble
to
think
i
set
out
a
new
man
in
three
steps
it
seemed
to
me
we
had
reached
the
city
gate
to
find
the
way
blocked
by
a
company
of
twenty
or
thirty
horse
the
quentin
uniform
flaunting
gay
in
the
sun
the
nearest
trooper
set
up
a
shout
at
sight
of
us
when
vigo
coming
out
suddenly
from
behind
a
nag
took
le
comte
in
his
big
embrace
he
released
him
immediately
looking
immensely
startled
at
his
own
demonstration
étienne
laughed
out
at
him
be
more
careful
i
beg
you
vigo
you
will
make
me
imagine
myself
of
some
importance
i
thought
you
swallowed
up
vigo
growled
you
had
been
here
i
could
get
a
trace
of
you
i
was
killing
lucas
sacré
he
dead
dead
that
the
best
morning
work
ever
you
did
m
étienne
have
you
horse
for
us
vigo
of
course
some
of
the
men
will
walk
i
suppose
we
leaving
paris
to
buy
you
out
of
the
bastille
not
worth
it
eh
vigo
yes
said
vigo
gravely
yes
étienne
you
are
worth
it
vigo
troop
was
but
as
some
of
the
horses
carried
double
some
were
loaded
with
chattels
étienne
and
i
on
the
soon
left
the
cavalcade
behind
us
before
i
knew
it
we
were
halted
at
the
outpost
of
the
camp
my
lord
gave
his
name
to
be
sure
cried
the
sentry
we
orders
about
you
you
dine
with
the
king
de
mar
mordieu
i
do
you
do
orders
are
to
take
you
to
him
out
of
hand
captain
the
officer
lounged
out
of
the
tavern
door
captain
de
mar
oh
aye
cried
the
captain
coming
forward
with
brisk
interest
de
mar
you
the
child
of
luck
you
dine
with
the
king
i
am
the
child
of
bewilderment
captain
and
you
not
too
much
time
to
recover
from
it
le
comte
you
are
to
go
straight
to
the
king
i
may
go
to
de
quentin
lodgings
first
no
monsieur
straight
to
the
king
what
in
my
shirt
i
ca
help
it
monsieur
the
captain
laughed
i
suppose
the
king
did
not
guess
you
were
coming
in
your
shirt
anyway
his
order
was
to
fetch
you
direct
and
direct
you
go
but
never
care
our
king
no
stickler
for
toggery
he
known
what
it
is
himself
to
lack
for
a
coat
i
might
wash
my
face
then
certainly
no
harm
in
that
so
étienne
went
into
the
tournebride
and
washed
his
face
and
that
was
all
the
toilet
he
made
for
audience
with
the
greatest
king
in
the
world
you
ride
to
monsieur
he
commanded
me
when
the
captain
answered
no
he
goes
with
you
monsieur
if
he
the
boy
choux
troux
whatever
it
is
broux
félix
broux
i
cried
that
it
you
go
to
the
king
too
another
i
thought
so
indeed
we
followed
the
sentry
through
the
town
in
a
waking
dream
content
to
let
him
do
with
us
as
he
would
he
did
the
talking
explained
to
the
grandees
in
the
king
hall
our
names
and
errand
one
of
them
led
us
up
the
stairs
and
knocked
at
a
closed
door
enter
it
was
henry
own
voice
i
pinched
monsieur
hand
to
tell
him
our
guide
opened
the
door
a
crack
de
mar
sire
and
his
servant
good
la
force
let
them
enter
la
force
fairly
pushed
us
over
the
sill
so
abashed
were
we
and
shut
the
door
upon
us
the
king
was
alone
but
before
this
simple
gentleman
in
the
rusty
black
étienne
caught
his
breath
as
he
had
not
done
before
a
court
in
full
pomp
he
had
seen
courts
but
he
had
never
seen
the
first
soldier
of
europe
he
advanced
three
steps
into
the
room
and
forgot
to
kneel
forgot
to
lower
his
gaze
in
the
presence
but
merely
stared
at
majesty
as
majesty
stared
at
him
thus
they
stood
surveying
each
other
from
top
to
toe
in
the
frankest
curiosity
till
at
length
the
king
spoke
de
mar
you
look
less
like
a
than
i
expected
étienne
came
to
himself
to
kneel
at
once
sire
i
blush
for
my
looks
but
your
zealous
soldiers
would
not
let
me
from
their
clutches
i
am
just
come
from
killing
paul
de
lorraine
what
the
spy
lucas
himself
and
when
i
left
the
spot
by
way
of
the
window
in
some
haste
i
was
not
expecting
this
honour
sire
nor
do
i
think
you
deserve
it
the
king
cried
though
you
come
hatless
and
you
have
been
a
long
time
on
the
road
de
mar
aye
sire
you
might
as
well
have
stayed
away
as
come
at
this
hour
marry
over
go
hang
yourself
my
breathless
follower
we
have
fought
all
our
great
battles
and
you
were
not
there
scarlet
under
the
lash
étienne
kneeling
bent
his
eyes
on
the
ground
he
was
silent
but
as
the
king
spoke
not
he
felt
it
incumbent
to
stammer
something
that
is
my
life
misfortune
sire
misfortune
sirrah
misfortune
you
call
it
let
me
hear
you
say
fault
i
dare
not
sire
étienne
murmured
it
was
of
course
your
majesty
fault
we
can
not
serve
heretics
we
st
quentins
you
think
well
of
yourself
young
mar
i
must
sire
when
your
majesty
invites
me
to
dinner
the
king
burst
into
laughter
and
his
temper
which
i
believe
was
all
a
play
vanished
to
the
winds
pardieu
you
a
glib
fellow
mar
but
i
did
invite
you
to
dinner
for
your
own
sake
little
as
you
can
imagine
it
so
you
would
have
joined
my
flag
four
years
ago
had
i
not
been
a
stinking
heretic
aye
sire
i
needs
must
have
therefore
am
i
everlastingly
beholden
to
your
majesty
for
remaining
so
long
a
huguenot
how
now
cockerel
étienne
faltered
a
moment
he
was
not
burdened
by
shyness
but
before
the
king
sharp
glance
he
underwent
a
cold
terror
lest
he
had
been
too
free
with
his
tongue
however
there
was
naught
to
do
but
go
on
sire
had
i
fought
under
your
banner
like
a
man
at
dieppe
and
arques
and
ivry
de
mayenne
had
never
dreamed
of
marrying
his
ward
to
me
i
had
never
known
her
the
loveliest
demoiselle
i
ever
saw
the
king
cried
i
shall
marry
her
to
one
of
my
staunchest
supporters
illustration
the
meeting
the
smile
was
washed
from
étienne
lips
he
turned
as
white
as
linen
in
one
moment
his
youth
seemed
to
go
from
him
the
king
unnoting
picked
a
parchment
off
the
table
to
one
of
my
bravest
captains
here
his
commission
my
lad
étienne
stared
up
from
the
writing
into
the
king
laughing
face
i
sire
i
you
mar
you
you
are
my
staunch
supporter
perhaps
your
an
you
ask
it
sire
he
pressed
his
lips
to
the
king
hand
great
helpless
tears
dripping
down
upon
it
if
i
ever
desert
you
i
am
a
dog
sire
but
the
fighting
is
not
all
done
i
will
capture
you
a
flag
yet
perhaps
i
much
fear
me
there
life
in
mayenne
still
étienne
not
venturing
to
rise
yet
lifted
beseeching
eyes
to
the
king
what
you
want
to
get
away
from
me
my
lord
who
wanted
precisely
that
had
no
choice
but
to
protest
that
nothing
was
farther
from
his
thoughts
stuff
the
king
exclaimed
you
in
a
sweat
to
be
gone
you
unmannerly
churl
you
a
raw
untried
boy
are
invited
to
dine
with
the
king
and
your
one
itch
is
to
escape
the
tedium
sire
peace
you
are
guilty
sirrah
take
your
punishment
he
darted
across
the
room
and
throwing
open
an
inner
door
called
gently
mademoiselle
yes
sire
she
answered
coming
to
the
threshold
the
peasant
lass
was
gone
forever
the
great
lady
regal
in
satins
stood
before
us
she
bent
on
the
king
a
little
eager
questioning
glance
then
she
caught
sight
of
her
lover
faith
had
the
sun
gone
out
the
room
would
have
been
brilliant
with
the
light
of
her
face
étienne
sprang
up
and
toward
her
and
she
pushing
by
the
king
as
if
he
had
been
the
went
to
him
they
stood
before
each
other
neither
touching
nor
speaking
but
only
looking
one
at
the
other
like
two
blind
folk
by
a
heavenly
miracle
restored
to
sight
how
now
children
am
i
not
a
model
monarch
do
you
swear
by
me
forever
do
you
vouch
me
the
very
pattern
of
a
king
answer
he
got
none
they
heard
nothing
knew
nothing
but
each
other
the
slighted
king
chuckled
and
beckoning
me
withdrew
to
his
cabinet
so
here
an
end
for
if
henry
of
france
leave
them
you
and
i
may
not
stay
