what
every
woman
knows
by
james
barrie
act
i
james
wylie
is
about
to
make
a
move
on
the
dambrod
and
in
the
little
scotch
room
there
is
an
awful
silence
befitting
the
occasion
james
with
his
hand
poised
for
if
he
touches
a
piece
he
has
to
play
it
alick
will
see
to
that
raises
his
red
head
suddenly
to
read
alick
s
face
his
father
who
is
alick
is
pretending
to
be
in
a
panic
lest
james
should
make
this
move
james
grins
heartlessly
and
his
fingers
are
about
to
close
on
the
man
when
some
instinct
of
makes
him
peep
once
more
this
time
alick
is
caught
the
unholy
ecstasy
on
his
face
tells
as
plain
as
porridge
that
he
has
been
luring
james
to
destruction
james
glares
and
too
late
his
opponent
is
a
simple
old
father
again
james
mops
his
head
sprawls
in
the
manner
most
conducive
to
thought
in
the
wylie
family
and
protruding
his
underlip
settles
down
to
a
reconsideration
of
the
board
alick
blows
out
his
cheeks
and
a
drop
of
water
settles
on
the
point
of
his
nose
you
will
find
them
thus
any
saturday
night
after
family
worship
which
sends
the
servant
to
bed
and
sometimes
the
pauses
are
so
long
that
in
the
end
they
forget
whose
move
it
is
it
is
not
the
room
you
would
be
shown
into
if
you
were
calling
socially
on
miss
wylie
the
for
you
and
miss
wylie
in
a
coloured
merino
to
receive
you
very
likely
she
would
exclaim
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
though
she
has
seen
you
coming
up
the
avenue
and
has
just
had
time
to
whip
the
dustcloths
off
the
chairs
and
to
warn
alick
david
and
james
that
they
had
better
not
dare
come
in
to
see
you
before
they
have
put
on
a
dickey
nor
is
this
the
room
in
which
you
would
dine
in
solemn
grandeur
if
invited
to
drop
in
and
take
which
is
how
the
wylies
invite
it
being
a
family
weakness
to
pretend
that
they
sit
down
in
the
daily
it
is
the
real
of
the
house
where
alick
who
will
never
get
used
to
fashionable
ways
can
take
off
his
collar
and
sit
happily
in
his
stocking
soles
and
james
at
times
would
do
so
also
but
catch
maggie
letting
him
there
is
one
very
fine
chair
but
heavens
not
for
sitting
on
just
to
give
the
room
a
social
standing
in
an
emergency
it
sneers
at
the
other
chairs
with
an
air
of
insolent
superiority
like
a
haughty
bride
who
has
married
into
the
house
for
money
otherwise
the
furniture
is
homely
most
of
it
has
come
from
that
smaller
house
where
the
wylies
began
there
is
the
large
and
shiny
chair
which
can
be
turned
into
a
bed
if
you
look
the
other
way
for
a
moment
james
can
not
sit
on
this
chair
without
gradually
sliding
down
it
till
he
is
lying
luxuriously
on
the
small
of
his
back
his
legs
indicating
like
the
hands
of
a
clock
that
it
is
ten
past
twelve
a
position
in
which
maggie
shudders
to
see
him
receiving
company
the
other
chairs
are
than
which
nothing
is
more
comfortable
if
there
be
a
good
slit
down
the
seat
the
seats
are
heavily
dented
because
all
the
wylie
family
sit
down
with
a
dump
the
is
on
the
edge
of
a
large
centre
table
which
also
displays
four
books
placed
at
equal
distances
from
each
other
one
of
them
a
bible
and
another
the
family
album
if
these
were
the
only
books
they
would
not
justify
maggie
in
calling
this
chamber
the
library
her
dogged
name
for
it
while
david
and
james
call
it
the
and
alick
calls
it
the
room
which
is
to
him
the
natural
name
for
any
apartment
without
a
bed
in
it
there
is
a
bookcase
of
pitch
pine
which
contains
six
hundred
books
with
glass
doors
to
prevent
your
getting
at
them
no
one
does
try
to
get
at
the
books
for
the
wylies
are
not
a
reading
family
they
like
you
to
gasp
when
you
see
so
much
literature
gathered
together
in
one
but
they
gasp
themselves
at
the
thought
that
there
are
persons
chiefly
clergymen
who
having
finished
one
book
coolly
begin
another
nevertheless
it
was
not
all
vainglory
that
made
david
buy
this
library
it
was
rather
a
mighty
respect
for
education
as
something
that
he
has
missed
this
same
feeling
makes
him
take
in
the
contemporary
review
and
stand
up
to
it
like
a
man
alick
who
also
has
a
respect
for
education
tries
to
read
the
contemporary
but
becomes
dispirited
and
may
be
heard
muttering
over
its
pages
no
no
use
no
use
no
and
sometimes
even
oh
james
has
no
respect
for
education
and
maggie
is
at
present
of
an
open
mind
they
are
wylie
and
sons
of
the
local
granite
quarry
in
which
alick
was
throughout
his
working
days
a
mason
it
is
david
who
has
raised
them
to
this
position
he
climbed
up
himself
step
by
step
and
hewed
the
steps
and
drew
the
others
up
after
him
wylie
brothers
alick
would
have
had
the
firm
called
but
david
said
no
and
james
said
no
and
maggie
said
no
first
honour
must
be
to
their
father
and
alick
now
likes
it
on
the
whole
though
he
often
sighs
at
having
to
shave
every
day
and
on
some
snell
mornings
he
still
creeps
from
his
couch
at
four
and
even
at
two
thinking
that
his
mallet
and
chisel
are
calling
him
and
begins
to
pull
on
his
trousers
until
the
grandeur
of
them
reminds
him
that
he
can
go
to
bed
again
sometimes
he
cries
a
little
because
there
is
no
more
work
for
him
to
do
for
ever
and
ever
and
then
maggie
gives
him
a
spade
without
telling
david
or
david
gives
him
the
logs
to
saw
without
telling
maggie
we
have
given
james
a
longer
time
to
make
his
move
than
our
kind
friends
in
front
will
give
him
but
in
the
meantime
something
has
been
happening
david
has
come
in
wearing
a
black
coat
and
his
sabbath
boots
for
he
has
been
to
a
public
meeting
david
is
nigh
forty
years
of
age
whiskered
like
his
father
and
brother
alick
s
whiskers
being
worn
as
a
sort
of
cravat
round
the
neck
and
he
has
the
too
brisk
manner
of
one
who
must
arrive
anywhere
a
little
before
any
one
else
the
painter
who
did
the
three
of
them
for
fifteen
pounds
you
may
observe
the
canvases
on
the
walls
has
caught
this
characteristic
perhaps
accidentally
for
david
is
almost
stepping
out
of
his
frame
as
if
to
hurry
off
somewhere
while
alick
and
james
look
as
if
they
were
pinned
to
the
wall
for
life
all
the
six
of
them
men
and
pictures
however
have
a
family
resemblance
like
granite
blocks
from
their
own
quarry
they
are
as
scotch
as
peat
for
instance
and
they
might
exchange
eyes
without
any
neighbour
noticing
the
difference
inquisitive
little
blue
eyes
that
seem
to
be
always
totting
up
the
price
of
things
the
dambrod
players
pay
no
attention
to
david
nor
does
he
regard
them
dumping
down
on
the
sofa
he
removes
his
lastic
sides
as
his
sabbath
boots
are
called
by
pushing
one
foot
against
the
other
gets
into
a
pair
of
slippers
deposits
the
boots
as
according
to
rule
in
the
ottoman
and
crosses
to
the
fire
there
must
be
something
on
david
s
mind
for
he
pays
no
attention
to
the
game
neither
gives
advice
than
which
nothing
is
more
maddening
nor
exchanges
a
wink
with
alick
over
the
parlous
condition
of
james
s
crown
you
can
hear
the
clock
in
the
lobby
ticking
then
david
lets
himself
go
it
runs
out
of
him
like
a
hymn
david
oh
let
the
solid
ground
not
fail
beneath
my
feet
before
my
life
has
found
what
some
have
found
so
sweet
this
is
not
a
soliloquy
but
is
offered
as
a
definite
statement
the
players
emerge
from
their
game
with
difficulty
alick
with
james
s
crown
in
his
hand
what
s
that
you
re
saying
david
david
like
a
public
speaker
explaining
the
situation
in
a
few
words
the
thing
i
m
speaking
about
is
love
james
keeping
control
of
himself
do
you
stand
there
and
say
you
re
in
love
david
wylie
david
me
what
would
i
do
with
the
thing
james
who
is
by
no
means
without
pluck
i
see
no
necessity
for
calling
it
a
thing
they
are
two
bachelors
who
all
their
lives
have
been
afraid
of
nothing
but
woman
david
in
his
sportive
days
which
continue
has
done
roguish
things
with
his
arm
when
conducting
a
lady
home
under
an
umbrella
from
a
soiree
and
has
both
chuckled
and
been
scared
on
thinking
of
it
afterwards
james
a
commoner
fellow
altogether
has
discussed
the
sex
over
a
glass
but
is
too
canny
to
be
in
the
company
of
less
than
two
young
women
at
a
time
david
derisively
oho
has
she
got
you
james
james
feeling
the
sting
of
it
nobody
has
got
me
david
they
ll
catch
you
yet
lad
james
they
ll
never
catch
me
you
ve
been
nearer
catched
yourself
alick
yes
kitty
menzies
david
david
feeling
himself
under
the
umbrella
it
was
a
kind
of
a
shave
that
alick
who
knows
all
that
is
to
be
known
about
women
and
can
speak
of
them
without
a
tremor
it
s
a
curious
thing
but
a
man
can
not
help
winking
when
he
hears
that
one
of
his
friends
has
been
catched
david
that
s
so
james
clinging
to
his
manhood
and
fear
of
that
wink
is
what
has
kept
the
two
of
us
single
men
and
yet
what
s
the
glory
of
being
single
david
there
s
no
particular
glory
in
it
but
it
s
safe
james
putting
away
his
aspirations
yes
it
s
lonely
but
it
s
safe
but
who
did
you
mean
the
poetry
for
then
david
for
maggie
of
course
you
don
t
know
david
and
james
till
you
know
how
they
love
their
sister
maggie
alick
i
thought
that
david
coming
to
the
second
point
of
his
statement
about
love
i
saw
her
reading
poetry
and
saying
those
words
over
to
herself
james
she
has
such
a
poetical
mind
david
love
there
s
no
doubt
as
that
s
what
maggie
has
set
her
heart
on
and
not
merely
love
but
one
of
those
grand
noble
loves
for
though
maggie
is
undersized
she
has
a
passion
for
romance
james
wandering
miserably
about
the
room
it
s
terrible
not
to
be
able
to
give
maggie
what
her
heart
is
set
on
the
others
never
pay
much
attention
to
james
though
he
is
quite
a
smart
figure
in
less
important
houses
alick
violently
those
idiots
of
men
david
father
did
you
tell
her
who
had
got
the
minister
of
galashiels
alick
wagging
his
head
sadly
i
had
to
tell
her
and
then
i
i
bought
her
a
sealskin
muff
and
i
just
slipped
it
into
her
hands
and
came
away
james
illustrating
the
sense
of
justice
in
the
wylie
family
of
course
to
be
fair
to
the
man
he
never
pretended
he
wanted
her
david
none
of
them
wants
her
that
s
what
depresses
her
i
was
thinking
father
i
would
buy
her
that
gold
watch
and
chain
in
snibby
s
window
she
hankers
after
it
james
slapping
his
pocket
you
re
too
late
david
i
ve
got
them
for
her
david
it
s
ill
done
of
the
minister
many
a
pound
of
steak
has
that
man
had
in
this
house
alick
you
mind
the
slippers
she
worked
for
him
james
i
mind
them
fine
she
began
them
for
william
cathro
she
s
getting
on
in
years
too
though
she
looks
so
young
alick
i
never
can
make
up
my
mind
david
whether
her
curls
make
her
look
younger
or
older
david
determinedly
younger
whist
i
hear
her
winding
the
clock
mind
not
a
word
about
the
minister
to
her
james
don
t
even
mention
religion
this
day
james
would
it
be
like
me
to
do
such
a
thing
david
it
would
be
very
like
you
and
there
s
that
other
matter
say
not
a
syllable
about
our
having
a
reason
for
sitting
up
late
when
she
says
it
s
just
all
pretend
we
re
not
sleepy
alick
exactly
and
when
here
maggie
enters
and
all
three
are
suddenly
engrossed
in
the
dambrod
we
could
describe
maggie
at
great
length
but
what
is
the
use
what
you
really
want
to
know
is
whether
she
was
no
she
was
not
enter
maggie
who
is
not
when
this
is
said
all
is
said
enter
maggie
as
it
were
with
her
throat
cut
from
ear
to
ear
she
has
a
soft
scotch
voice
and
a
more
resolute
manner
than
is
perhaps
fitting
to
her
plainness
and
she
stops
short
at
sight
of
james
sprawling
unconsciously
in
the
company
chair
maggie
james
i
wouldn
t
sit
on
the
fine
chair
james
i
forgot
again
but
he
wishes
she
had
spoken
more
sharply
even
profanation
of
the
fine
chair
has
not
roused
her
she
takes
up
her
knitting
and
they
all
suspect
that
she
knows
what
they
have
been
talking
about
maggie
you
re
late
david
it
s
nearly
david
finding
the
subject
a
safe
one
i
was
kept
late
at
the
public
meeting
alick
glad
to
get
so
far
away
from
galashiels
was
it
a
good
meeting
david
fairish
with
some
heat
that
young
john
shand
would
make
a
speech
maggie
john
shand
is
that
the
student
shand
david
the
same
it
s
true
he
s
a
student
at
glasgow
university
in
the
winter
months
but
in
summer
he
s
just
the
railway
porter
here
and
i
think
it
s
very
presumptuous
of
a
young
lad
like
that
to
make
a
speech
when
he
hasn
t
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
alick
the
shands
were
always
an
impudent
family
and
jealous
i
suppose
that
s
the
reason
they
haven
t
been
on
speaking
terms
with
us
this
six
years
was
it
a
good
speech
david
illustrating
the
family
s
generosity
it
was
very
fine
but
he
needn
t
have
made
fun
of
me
maggie
losing
a
stitch
he
dared
david
depressed
you
see
i
can
not
get
started
on
a
speech
without
saying
things
like
in
rising
for
to
make
a
few
james
what
s
wrong
with
it
david
he
mimicked
me
and
said
will
our
worthy
chairman
come
for
to
go
for
to
answer
my
questions
and
so
on
and
they
roared
james
slapping
his
money
pocket
the
sacket
david
i
did
feel
bitterly
father
the
want
of
education
without
knowing
it
he
has
a
beautiful
way
of
pronouncing
this
noble
word
maggie
holding
out
a
kind
hand
to
him
david
alick
i
ve
missed
it
sore
david
even
now
i
feel
the
want
of
it
in
the
very
marrow
of
me
i
m
ashamed
to
think
i
never
gave
you
your
chance
but
when
you
were
young
i
was
so
desperate
poor
how
could
i
do
it
maggie
maggie
it
wasn
t
possible
father
alick
gazing
at
the
to
be
able
to
understand
these
books
to
up
with
them
one
at
a
time
and
scrape
them
as
clean
as
though
they
were
a
bowl
of
brose
lads
it
s
not
to
riches
it
s
to
scholarship
that
i
make
my
humble
bow
james
who
is
good
at
bathos
there
s
ten
yards
of
them
and
they
were
selected
by
the
minister
of
galashiels
he
said
david
quickly
james
james
i
mean
i
mean
maggie
calmly
i
suppose
you
mean
what
you
say
james
i
hear
david
that
the
minister
of
galashiels
is
to
be
married
on
that
miss
turnbull
david
on
guard
so
they
were
saying
alick
all
i
can
say
is
she
has
made
a
poor
bargain
maggie
the
damned
i
wonder
at
you
father
he
s
a
very
nice
gentleman
i
m
sure
i
hope
he
has
chosen
wisely
james
not
him
maggie
getting
near
her
tragedy
how
can
you
say
that
when
you
don
t
know
her
i
expect
she
is
full
of
charm
alick
charm

s
the
very
word
he
used
david
havering
idiot
alick
what
is
charm
exactly
maggie
maggie
oh
it
s
it
s
a
sort
of
bloom
on
a
woman
if
you
have
it
you
don
t
need
to
have
anything
else
and
if
you
don
t
have
it
it
doesn
t
much
matter
what
else
you
have
some
women
the
few
have
charm
for
all
and
most
have
charm
for
one
but
some
have
charm
for
none
somehow
she
has
stopped
knitting

are
very
depressed
james
brings
his
fist
down
on
the
table
with
a
crash
james
shouting
i

a
sister
that
has
charm
maggie

t
james
rushing
at
her
with
the
watch
and
chain

e
maggie

lets
them

in
her
lap
david
maggie
would
you
like
a
silk
maggie
what
could
i
do
with
a
silk

a
gust
of
passion
you

as
well
dress
up
a
little
brown
hen
they
wriggle
miserably
james
stamping

him
here
to
me

be
obliged
if
you
wouldn
t
kick
me
beneath
the
table
maggie
rising
let
s
be
practical
let
s
go
to
our
beds
this
reminds
them
that
they
have
a
job
on
hand
in
which
she
is
not
to
share
david
slily
i
don
t
feel
very
sleepy
yet
alick
nor
me
either
james
you
ve
just
taken
the
very
words
out
of
my
mouth
david
with
unusual
politeness
to
you
maggie
maggie
fixing
the
three
of
them
all
of
you
unsleepy
when
as
is
well
known
ten
o
clock
is
your
regular
james
yes
it
s
common
knowledge
that
we
go
to
our
beds
at
ten
chuckling
that
s
what
we
re
counting
on
maggie
counting
on
david
you
stupid
whelp
james
what
have
i
done
maggie
folding
her
arms
there
s
something
up
you
ve
got
to
tell
me
david
david
who
knows
when
he
is
beaten
go
out
and
watch
james
maggie
watch
james
takes
himself
off
armed
as
maggie
notices
with
a
stick
david
in
his
alert
business
way
maggie
there
are
burglars
about
maggie
burglars
she
sits
rigid
but
she
is
not
the
kind
to
scream
david
we
hadn
t
meant
for
to
tell
you
till
we
nabbed
them
but
they
ve
been
in
this
room
twice
of
late
we
sat
up
last
night
waiting
for
them
and
we
re
to
sit
up
again
maggie
the
silver
plate
david
it
s
all
safe
as
yet
that
makes
us
think
that
they
were
either
frightened
away
these
other
times
or
that
they
are
coming
back
for
to
make
a
clean
sweep
maggie
how
did
you
get
to
know
about
this
david
it
was
on
tuesday
that
the
polissman
called
at
the
quarry
with
a
very
queer
story
he
had
seen
a
man
climbing
out
at
this
window
at
ten
past
two
maggie
did
he
chase
him
david
it
was
so
dark
he
lost
sight
of
him
at
once
alick
tell
her
about
the
window
david
we
ve
found
out
that
the
catch
of
the
window
has
been
pushed
back
by
slipping
the
blade
of
a
knife
between
the
woodwork
maggie
david
alick
the
polissman
said
he
was
carrying
a
little
carpet
bag
maggie
the
silver
plate
is
gone
david
no
no
we
were
thinking
that
very
likely
he
has
bunches
of
keys
in
the
bag
maggie
or
weapons
david
as
for
that
we
have
some
pretty
stout
weapons
ourselves
in
the
umbrella
stand
so
if
you
ll
go
to
your
bed
maggie
maggie
me
and
my
brothers
in
danger
alick
there
s
just
one
of
them
maggie
the
polissman
just
saw
one
david
licking
his
palms
i
would
be
very
pleased
if
there
were
three
of
them
maggie
i
watch
with
you
i
would
be
very
pleased
if
there
were
four
of
them
david
and
they
say
she
has
no
charm
james
returns
on
tiptoe
as
if
the
burglars
were
beneath
the
table
he
signs
to
every
one
to
breathe
no
more
and
then
whispers
his
news
james
he
s
there
i
had
no
sooner
gone
out
than
i
saw
him
sliding
down
the
garden
wall
close
to
the
rhubarbs
alick
what
s
he
like
james
he
s
an
ugly
customer
that
s
all
i
could
see
there
was
a
little
carpet
bag
in
his
hand
david
that
s
him
james
he
slunk
into
the
rhodydendrons
and
he
s
there
now
watching
the
window
david
we
have
him
out
with
the
light
the
room
is
beautified
by
a
chandelier
fitted
for
three
gas
jets
but
with
the
advance
of
progress
one
of
these
has
been
removed
and
the
incandescent
light
put
in
its
place
this
alone
is
lit
alick
climbs
a
chair
pulls
a
little
chain
and
the
room
is
now
but
vaguely
lit
by
the
fire
it
plays
fitfully
on
four
sparkling
faces
maggie
do
you
think
he
saw
you
james
james
i
couldn
t
say
but
in
any
case
i
was
too
clever
for
him
i
looked
up
at
the
stars
and
yawned
loud
at
them
as
if
i
was
tremendous
sleepy
there
is
a
long
pause
during
which
they
are
lurking
in
the
shadows
at
last
they
hear
some
movement
and
they
steal
like
ghosts
from
the
room
we
see
david
turning
out
the
lobby
light
then
the
door
closes
and
an
empty
room
awaits
the
intruder
with
a
shudder
of
expectancy
the
window
opens
and
shuts
as
softly
as
if
this
were
a
mother
peering
in
to
see
whether
her
baby
is
asleep
then
the
head
of
a
man
shows
between
the
curtains
the
remainder
of
him
follows
he
is
carrying
a
little
carpet
bag
he
stands
irresolute
what
puzzles
him
evidently
is
that
the
wylies
should
have
retired
to
rest
without
lifting
that
piece
of
coal
off
the
fire
he
opens
the
door
and
peeps
into
the
lobby
listening
to
the
clock
all
seems
serene
and
he
turns
on
the
light
we
see
him
clearly
now
he
is
john
shand
age
boots
muddy
as
an
indignant
carpet
can
testify
he
wears
a
shabby
topcoat
and
a
cockerty
bonnet
otherwise
he
is
in
the
corduroys
of
a
railway
porter
his
movements
at
first
stealthy
become
almost
homely
as
he
feels
that
he
is
secure
he
opens
the
bag
and
takes
out
a
bunch
of
keys
a
small
paper
parcel
and
a
black
implement
that
may
be
a
burglar
s
jemmy
this
cool
customer
examines
the
fire
and
piles
on
more
coals
with
the
keys
he
opens
the
door
of
the
bookcase
selects
two
large
volumes
and
brings
them
to
the
table
he
takes
off
his
topcoat
and
opens
his
parcel
which
we
now
see
contains
sheets
of
foolscap
paper
his
next
action
shows
that
the
jemmy
is
really
a
ruler
he
knows
where
the
pen
and
ink
are
kept
he
pulls
the
fine
chair
nearer
to
the
table
sits
on
it
and
proceeds
to
write
occasionally
dotting
the
carpet
with
ink
as
he
stabs
the
air
with
his
pen
he
is
so
occupied
that
he
does
not
see
the
door
opening
and
the
wylie
family
staring
at
him
they
are
armed
with
sticks
alick
at
last
when
you
re
ready
john
shand
john
hints
back
and
then
he
has
the
grace
to
rise
dogged
and
expressionless
james
like
a
railway
porter
ticket
please
david
you
can
t
think
of
anything
clever
for
to
go
for
to
say
now
john
maggie
i
hope
you
find
that
chair
comfortable
young
man
john
i
have
no
complaint
to
make
against
the
chair
alick
who
is
really
distressed
a
native
of
the
town
the
disgrace
to
your
family
i
feel
pity
for
the
shands
this
night
john
glowering
i
ll
thank
you
wylie
not
to
pity
my
family
james
canny
canny
maggie
that
sense
of
justice
again
i
think
you
should
let
the
young
man
explain
it
mayn
t
be
so
bad
as
we
thought
david
explain
away
my
billie
john
only
the
uneducated
would
need
an
explanation
i
m
a
student
with
a
little
passion
and
i
m
desperate
for
want
of
books
you
have
all
i
want
here
no
use
to
you
but
for
display
well
i
came
here
to
study
i
come
twice
weekly
amazement
of
his
hosts
david
who
is
the
first
to
recover
by
the
window
john
do
you
think
a
shand
would
so
far
lower
himself
as
to
enter
your
door
well
is
it
a
case
for
the
police
james
it
is
maggie
not
so
much
out
of
the
goodness
of
her
heart
as
to
patronise
the
shands
it
seems
to
me
it
s
a
case
for
us
all
to
go
to
our
beds
and
leave
the
young
man
to
study
but
not
on
that
chair
and
she
wheels
the
chair
away
from
him
john
thank
you
miss
maggie
but
i
couldn
t
be
beholden
to
you
james
my
opinion
is
that
he
s
nobody
so
out
with
him
john
yes
out
with
me
and
you
ll
be
cheered
to
hear
i
m
likely
to
be
a
nobody
for
a
long
time
to
come
david
who
had
been
beginning
to
respect
him
are
you
a
poor
scholar
john
on
the
contrary
i
m
a
brilliant
scholar
david
it
s
siller
then
john
glorified
by
experiences
he
has
shared
with
many
a
gallant
soul
my
first
year
at
college
i
lived
on
a
barrel
of
potatoes
and
we
had
just
a
between
two
of
us
when
the
one
lay
down
the
other
had
to
get
up
do
you
think
it
was
hardship
it
was
sublime
but
this
year
i
can
t
afford
it
i
ll
have
to
stay
on
here
collecting
the
tickets
of
the
illiterate
such
as
you
when
i
might
be
with
romulus
and
remus
among
the
stars
james
summing
up
havers
david
in
whose
head
some
design
is
vaguely
taking
shape
whist
james
i
must
say
young
lad
i
like
your
spirit
now
tell
me
what
s
your
professors
opinion
of
your
future
john
they
think
me
a
young
man
of
extraordinary
promise
david
you
have
a
name
here
for
high
moral
character
john
and
justly
david
are
you
john
i
never
laughed
in
my
life
david
who
do
you
sit
under
in
glasgow
john
flemister
of
the
sauchiehall
high
david
are
you
a
teacher
john
i
am
david
one
more
question
are
you
promised
john
to
a
lady
david
yes
john
i
ve
never
given
one
of
them
a
single
word
of
encouragement
i
m
too
much
occupied
thinking
about
my
career
david
so
he
reflects
and
finally
indicates
by
a
jerk
of
the
head
that
he
wishes
to
talk
with
his
father
behind
the
door
james
longingly
do
you
want
me
too
but
they
go
out
without
even
answering
him
maggie
i
don
t
know
what
maggot
they
have
in
their
heads
but
sit
down
young
man
till
they
come
back
john
my
name
s
shand
and
till
i
m
called
that
i
decline
to
sit
down
again
in
this
house
maggie
then
i
m
thinking
young
sir
you
ll
have
a
weary
wait
while
he
waits
you
can
see
how
pinched
his
face
is
he
is
little
more
than
a
boy
and
he
seldom
has
enough
to
eat
david
and
alick
return
presently
looking
as
sly
as
if
they
had
been
discussing
some
move
on
the
dambrod
as
indeed
they
have
david
suddenly
become
genial
sit
down
shand
and
pull
in
your
chair
you
ll
have
a
thimbleful
of
something
to
keep
the
cold
out
briskly
glasses
maggie
she
wonders
but
gets
glasses
and
decanter
from
the
sideboard
which
james
calls
the
chiffy
david
and
alick
in
the
most
friendly
manner
also
draw
up
to
the
table
you
re
not
a
totaller
i
hope
john
guardedly
i
m
practically
a
totaller
david
so
are
we
how
do
you
take
it
is
there
any
hot
water
maggie
john
if
i
take
it
at
all
and
i
haven
t
made
up
my
mind
yet
i
ll
take
it
cold
david
you
ll
take
it
hot
james
james
also
sitting
at
the
table
but
completely
befogged
no
i
david
decisively
i
think
you
ll
take
it
hot
james
james
sulking
i
ll
take
it
hot
david
the
kettle
maggie
james
has
evidently
to
take
it
hot
so
that
they
can
get
at
the
business
now
on
hand
while
maggie
goes
kitchenward
for
the
kettle
alick
now
david
quick
before
she
comes
back
david
shand
we
have
an
offer
to
make
you
john
warningly
no
patronage
alick
it
s
strictly
a
business
affair
david
leave
it
to
me
father
it
s
this
but
to
his
annoyance
the
suspicious
maggie
has
already
returned
with
the
kettle
maggie
don
t
you
see
that
you
re
not
wanted
maggie
sitting
down
by
the
fire
and
resuming
her
knitting
i
do
david
david
i
have
a
proposition
to
put
before
shand
and
women
are
out
of
place
in
business
transactions
the
needles
continue
to
click
alick
sighing
we
ll
have
to
let
her
bide
david
david
sternly
woman
but
even
this
does
not
budge
her
very
well
then
sit
there
but
don
t
interfere
mind
shand
we
re
willing
the
three
of
us
to
lay
out
on
your
education
if
john
take
care
david
slowly
which
is
not
his
wont
on
condition
that
five
years
from
now
maggie
wylie
if
still
unmarried
can
claim
to
marry
you
should
such
be
her
wish
the
thing
to
be
perfectly
open
on
her
side
but
you
to
be
strictly
tied
down
james
enlightened
so
so
david
resuming
his
smart
manner
now
what
have
you
to
say
decide
john
after
a
pause
i
regret
to
say
maggie
it
doesn
t
matter
what
he
regrets
to
say
because
i
decide
against
it
and
i
think
it
was
very
of
you
to
make
any
such
proposal
david
without
looking
at
her
quiet
maggie
john
looking
at
her
i
must
say
miss
maggie
i
don
t
see
what
reasons
you
can
have
for
being
so
set
against
it
maggie
if
you
would
grow
a
beard
shand
the
reasons
wouldn
t
be
quite
so
obvious
john
i
ll
never
grow
a
beard
maggie
then
you
re
done
for
at
the
start
alick
come
come
maggie
seeing
i
have
refused
the
young
man
john
refused
david
that
s
no
reason
why
we
shouldn
t
have
his
friendly
opinion
your
objections
shand
john
simply
it
s
a
bargain
i
admit
i
m
no
catch
at
present
but
what
could
a
man
of
my
abilities
not
soar
to
with
three
hundred
pounds
something
far
above
what
she
could
aspire
to
maggie
oh
indeed
david
the
position
is
that
without
the
three
hundred
you
can
t
soar
john
you
have
me
there
maggie
yes
but
alick
you
see
you
re
safeguarded
maggie
you
don
t
need
to
take
him
unless
you
like
but
he
has
to
take
you
john
that
s
an
unfair
arrangement
also
maggie
i
wouldn
t
dream
of
it
without
that
condition
john
then
you
are
thinking
of
it
maggie
poof
david
it
s
a
good
arrangement
for
you
shand
the
chances
are
you
ll
never
have
to
go
on
with
it
for
in
all
probability
she
ll
marry
soon
james
she
s
tremendous
run
after
john
even
if
that
s
true
it
s
just
keeping
me
in
reserve
in
case
she
misses
doing
better
david
relieved
that
s
the
situation
in
a
nutshell
john
another
thing
supposing
i
was
to
get
fond
of
her
alick
wistfully
it
s
very
likely
john
yes
and
then
suppose
she
was
to
give
me
the
david
you
have
to
risk
that
john
or
take
it
the
other
way
supposing
as
i
got
to
know
her
i
could
not
endure
her
david
suavely
you
have
both
to
take
risks
james
less
suavely
what
you
need
john
shand
is
a
clout
on
the
head
john
three
hundred
pounds
is
no
great
sum
david
you
can
take
it
or
leave
it
alick
no
great
sum
for
a
student
studying
for
the
ministry
john
do
you
think
that
with
that
amount
of
money
i
would
stop
short
at
being
a
minister
david
that
s
how
i
like
to
hear
you
speak
a
young
scotsman
of
your
ability
let
loose
upon
the
world
with
what
could
he
not
do
it
s
almost
appalling
to
think
of
especially
if
he
went
among
the
english
john
what
do
you
think
miss
maggie
maggie
who
is
knitting
i
have
no
thoughts
on
the
subject
either
way
john
after
looking
her
over
what
s
her
age
she
looks
young
but
they
say
it
s
the
curls
that
does
it
david
rather
happily
she
s
one
of
those
women
who
are
eternally
young
john
i
can
t
take
that
for
an
answer
david
she
s
john
i
m
just
james
i
read
in
a
book
that
about
four
years
difference
in
the
ages
is
the
ideal
thing
as
usual
he
is
disregarded
david
well
shand
john
where
is
his
mother
i
m
willing
if
she
s
willing
david
maggie
maggie
there
can
be
no
if
about
it
it
must
be
an
offer
john
a
shand
give
a
wylie
such
a
chance
to
humiliate
him
never
maggie
then
all
is
off
david
come
come
shand
it
s
just
a
form
john
reluctantly
miss
maggie
will
you
maggie
doggedly
is
it
an
offer
john
dourly
yes
maggie
rising
before
i
answer
i
want
first
to
give
you
a
chance
of
drawing
back
david
maggie
maggie
bravely
when
they
said
that
i
have
been
run
after
they
were
misleading
you
i
m
without
charm
nobody
has
ever
been
after
me
john
oho
alick
they
will
be
yet
john
the
innocent
it
shows
at
least
that
you
haven
t
been
after
them
his
hosts
exchange
a
glance
maggie
one
thing
more
david
said
i
m
i
m
john
aha
maggie
now
be
practical
do
you
withdraw
from
the
bargain
or
do
you
not
john
on
reflection
it
s
a
bargain
maggie
then
so
be
it
david
hurriedly
and
that
s
settled
did
you
say
you
would
take
it
hot
shand
john
i
think
i
ll
take
it
neat
the
others
decide
to
take
it
hot
and
there
is
some
careful
business
here
with
the
toddy
ladles
alick
here
s
to
you
and
your
career
john
thank
you
to
you
miss
maggie
had
we
not
better
draw
up
a
legal
document
lawyer
crosbie
could
do
it
on
the
quiet
david
should
we
do
that
or
should
we
just
trust
to
one
another
s
honour
alick
gallantly
let
maggie
decide
maggie
i
think
we
would
better
have
a
legal
document
david
we
ll
have
it
drawn
up
i
was
thinking
the
best
way
would
be
for
to
pay
the
money
in
five
yearly
instalments
john
i
was
thinking
better
bank
the
whole
sum
in
my
name
at
once
alick
i
think
david
s
plan
s
the
best
john
i
think
not
of
course
if
it
s
not
convenient
to
you
david
touched
to
the
quick
it
s
perfectly
convenient
what
do
you
say
maggie
maggie
i
agree
with
john
david
with
an
odd
feeling
that
maggie
is
now
on
the
other
side
very
well
john
then
as
that
s
settled
i
think
i
ll
be
stepping
he
is
putting
his
papers
back
in
the
bag
alick
politely
if
you
would
like
to
sit
on
at
your
books
john
as
i
can
come
at
any
orra
time
now
i
think
i
ll
be
stepping
maggie
helps
him
into
his
topcoat
maggie
have
you
a
muffler
john
john
i
have
he
gets
it
from
his
pocket
maggie
you
had
better
put
it
twice
round
she
does
this
for
him
david
well
to
you
shand
alick
and
good
luck
john
thank
you
the
same
to
you
and
i
ll
cry
in
at
your
office
in
the
morning
before
the
is
due
david
i
ll
have
the
document
ready
for
you
there
is
the
awkward
pause
that
sometimes
follows
great
events
i
think
maggie
you
might
see
shand
to
the
door
maggie
certainly
john
is
going
by
the
window
this
way
john
she
takes
him
off
by
the
more
usual
exit
david
he
s
a
fine
frank
fellow
and
you
saw
how
cleverly
he
got
the
better
of
me
about
banking
the
money
as
the
heads
of
the
conspirators
come
gleefully
together
i
tell
you
father
he
has
a
grand
business
head
alick
lads
he
s
canny
he
s
cannier
than
any
of
us
james
except
maybe
maggie
he
has
no
idea
what
a
remarkable
woman
maggie
is
alick
best
he
shouldn
t
know
men
are
nervous
of
remarkable
women
james
she
s
a
long
time
in
coming
back
david
not
quite
comfortable
it
s
a
good
sign
h
sh
what
sort
of
a
night
is
it
maggie
maggie
it
s
a
little
blowy
she
gets
a
large
dustcloth
which
is
lying
folded
on
a
shelf
and
proceeds
to
spread
it
over
the
fine
chair
the
men
exchange
glances
david
stretching
himself
yes
well
well
oh
yes
it
s
getting
late
what
is
it
with
you
father
alick
i
m
ten
james
i
m
david
ten
they
wind
up
their
watches
maggie
it
s
high
time
we
were
bedded
she
puts
her
hands
on
their
shoulders
lovingly
which
is
the
very
thing
they
have
been
trying
to
avoid
you
re
very
kind
to
me
david
havers
alick
havers
james
but
this
does
not
matter
havers
maggie
a
little
dolefully
i
m
a
sort
of
sorry
for
the
young
man
david
david
not
at
all
you
ll
be
the
making
of
him
she
lifts
the
two
volumes
are
you
taking
the
books
to
your
bed
maggie
maggie
yes
i
don
t
want
him
to
know
things
i
don
t
know
myself
she
departs
with
the
books
and
alick
and
david
the
villains
now
want
to
get
away
from
each
other
alick
yes
yes
oh
yes
ay
man
it
is
so
umpha
you
ll
lift
the
big
coals
off
david
he
wanders
away
to
his
spring
mattress
david
removes
the
coals
james
who
would
like
to
sit
down
and
have
an
it
s
a
most
romantical
affair
but
he
gets
no
answer
i
wonder
how
it
ll
turn
out
no
answer
she
s
queer
maggie
i
wonder
how
some
clever
writers
has
never
noticed
how
queer
women
are
it
s
my
belief
you
could
write
a
whole
book
about
them
david
remains
obdurate
it
was
very
noble
of
her
to
tell
him
she
s
muttering
as
he
too
wanders
away
but
i
thought
she
was
david
turns
out
the
light
act
ii
six
years
have
elapsed
and
john
shand
s
great
hour
has
come
perhaps
his
great
hour
really
lies
ahead
of
him
perhaps
he
had
it
six
years
ago
it
often
passes
us
by
in
the
night
with
such
a
faint
call
that
we
don
t
even
turn
in
our
beds
but
according
to
the
trumpets
this
is
john
s
great
hour
it
is
the
hour
for
which
he
has
long
been
working
with
his
coat
off
and
now
the
coat
is
on
again
broadcloth
but
for
there
is
no
more
to
do
but
await
results
he
is
standing
for
parliament
and
this
is
election
night
as
the
scene
discloses
itself
you
get
so
to
speak
one
of
john
shand
s
posters
in
the
face
vote
for
shand
shand
shand
shand
civil
and
religious
liberty
faith
hope
freedom
they
are
all
names
for
shand
have
a
placard
about
shand
have
a
hundred
placards
about
him
it
is
snowing
shand
in
glasgow
take
the
paste
out
of
your
eye
and
you
will
see
that
we
are
in
one
of
shand
s
committee
rooms
it
has
been
a
hairdresser
s
emporium
but
shand
shand
shand
has
swept
through
it
like
a
wind
leaving
nothing
but
the
fixtures
why
shave
why
have
your
head
doused
in
those
basins
when
you
can
be
brushed
and
scraped
and
washed
up
for
ever
by
simply
voting
for
shand
there
are
a
few
hard
chairs
for
yelling
shand
from
and
then
rushing
away
there
is
an
iron
spiral
staircase
that
once
led
to
the
ladies
hairdressing
apartments
but
now
leads
to
more
shand
shand
shand
a
glass
door
at
the
back
opens
on
to
the
shop
proper
screaming
civil
and
religious
liberty
shand
as
it
opens
and
beyond
is
the
street
crammed
with
still
more
shand
pro
and
con
men
in
every
sort
of
garb
rush
in
and
out
up
and
down
the
stair
shouting
the
magic
word
then
there
is
a
lull
and
down
the
stair
comes
maggie
wylie
decidedly
overdressed
in
blue
velvet
and
let
us
get
this
over
less
than
ever
she
raises
her
hands
to
heaven
she
spins
round
like
a
little
teetotum
to
her
from
the
street
suffering
from
a
determination
of
the
word
shand
to
the
mouth
rush
alick
and
david
alick
is
thinner
being
older
david
is
stouter
being
older
and
they
are
both
in
tweeds
and
silk
hats
maggie

they

david
there

david
maggie
he
goes
on
his
knees
beside
her
pressing
her
to
him
in
affectionate
anxiety
it
was
mad
of
him
to
dare
maggie
it
was
grand
of
him
alick
moving
about
distraught
insane
ambition
maggie
glorious
ambition
david

the
worst
maggie
husky
i

prepared
alick
six
weary
years
has
she
waited
for
this
night
maggie
six
brave
years
has
john
toiled
for
this
night
james
and
you
could
have
had
him
maggie
at
the
end
of
five
the
document
says
five
maggie
do
you
think
i
grudge
not
being
married
to
him
yet
was
i
to
hamper
him
till
the
fight
was
won
david
with
wrinkled
brows
but
if
it
s
lost
she
can
t
answer
alick
starting
what
s
that
the
three
listen
at
the
door
the
shouting
dies
down
david
they
re
terrible
still
what
can
make
them
so
still
james
spirits
himself
away
alick
and
david
blanch
to
hear
maggie
speaking
softly
as
if
to
john
maggie
did
you
say
you
had
lost
john
of
course
you
would
lose
the
first
time
dear
john
six
years
very
well
we
ll
begin
another
six
you
ll
win
yet
fiercely
never
give
in
john
never
give
in
the
roar
of
the
multitude
breaks
out
again
and
comes
rolling
nearer
david
i
think
he
s
coming
james
is
fired
into
the
room
like
a
squeezed
onion
james
he
s
coming
they
may
go
on
speaking
but
through
the
clang
outside
none
could
hear
the
populace
seems
to
be
trying
to
take
the
committee
room
by
assault
out
of
the
scrimmage
a
man
emerges
dishevelled
and
bursts
into
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
him
it
is
john
shand
in
a
five
guinea
suit
including
the
hat
there
are
other
changes
in
him
also
for
he
has
been
delving
his
way
through
loamy
ground
all
those
years
his
right
shoulder
which
he
used
to
raise
to
pound
a
path
through
the
crowd
now
remains
permanently
in
that
position
his
mouth
tends
to
close
like
a
box
his
eyes
are
tired
they
need
some
one
to
pull
the
lids
over
them
and
send
him
to
sleep
for
a
week
but
they
are
honest
eyes
still
and
faithful
and
could
even
light
up
his
face
at
times
with
a
smile
if
the
mouth
would
give
a
little
help
john
clinging
to
a
chair
that
he
may
not
fly
straight
to
heaven
i
m
in
i
m
elected
majority
two
hundred
and
i
m
john
shand
the
crowd
have
the
news
by
this
time
and
their
roar
breaks
the
door
open
james
is
off
at
once
to
tell
them
that
he
is
to
be
shand
s
a
teardrop
clings
to
alick
s
nose
david
hits
out
playfully
at
john
and
john
in
an
ecstasy
returns
the
blow
david
fling
yourself
at
the
door
father
and
bar
them
out
maggie

hoarse
as

crow
and
i
have
to
address
the
cowcaddens
club
yet

on
it
john
loud
cries
of
remove
that
little
old
wifie
in
which
she
is
forcibly
ejected
and
the
honourable
gentleman
resumes
his
seat
in
a
torrent
of
admiring
applause

and
david
waggle
their
proud
heads
john

he
gives
john
three
cards
john
mr
david
him
that
was
speaking
for
you
john
the
same
he
s
a
whip
and
an
honourable
lady
sybil
frowns
her
she
s
his
sister
maggie
a
married
woman
john
no
the
comtesse
de
la
maggie
the
scholar
she
must
be
french
john
yes
i
think
she
s
some
relation
she
s
a
widow
james
but
what
am
i
to
say
to
them
mr
shand
s
compliments
and
he
will
be
proud
to
receive
them
is
the
very
least
that
the
wylies
expect
john
who
was
evidently
made
for
great
ends
say
i
m
very
busy
but
if
they
care
to
wait
i
hope
presently
to
give
them
a
few
minutes
james
thunderstruck
good
god
shand
but
it
makes
him
john
s
more
humble
servant
than
ever
and
he
departs
with
the
message
john
not
unaware
of
the
sensation
he
has
created
i
ll
go
up
and
let
the
crowd
see
me
from
the
window
maggie
but
but
what
are
we
to
do
with
these
ladies
john
as
he
tramps
upwards
it
s
your
reception
maggie
this
will
prove
you
maggie
growing
smaller
tell
me
what
you
know
about
this
lady
sybil
john
the
only
thing
i
know
about
her
is
that
she
thinks
me
vulgar
maggie
you
john
she
has
attended
some
of
my
meetings
and
i
m
told
she
said
that
maggie
what
could
the
woman
mean
john
i
wonder
when
i
come
down
i
ll
ask
her
with
his
departure
maggie
s
nervousness
increases
alick
encouragingly
in
at
them
maggie
with
your
french
maggie
it
s
all
slipping
from
me
father
david
gloomily
i
m
sure
to
say
for
to
come
for
to
the
newcomers
glorify
the
room
and
maggie
feels
that
they
have
lifted
her
up
with
the
tongs
and
deposited
her
in
one
of
the
basins
they
are
far
from
intending
to
be
rude
it
is
not
their
fault
that
thus
do
swans
scatter
the
ducks
they
do
not
know
that
they
are
guests
of
the
family
they
think
merely
that
they
are
waiting
with
other
strangers
in
a
public
room
they
undulate
inquiringly
and
if
maggie
could
undulate
in
return
she
would
have
no
cause
for
offence
but
she
suddenly
realises
that
this
is
an
art
as
yet
denied
her
and
that
though
david
might
buy
her
as
fine
as
theirs
and
is
at
this
moment
probably
deciding
to
do
so
she
would
look
better
carrying
them
in
her
arms
than
on
her
person
she
also
feels
that
to
emerge
from
wraps
as
they
are
doing
is
more
difficult
than
to
plank
your
money
on
the
counter
for
them
the
comtesse
she
could
forgive
for
she
is
old
but
lady
sybil
is
young
and
beautiful
and
comes
lazily
to
rest
like
a
stately
ship
of
tarsus
comtesse
smiling
divinely
and
speaking
with
such
a
pretty
accent
i
hope
one
is
not
in
the
way
we
were
told
we
might
wait
maggie
bravely
climbing
out
of
the
basin
certainly
i
am
sure
if
you
will
be
so
it
is
she
knows
that
david
and
her
father
are
very
sorry
for
her
a
high
voice
is
heard
orating
outside
sybil
screwing
her
nose
deliciously
he
is
at
it
again
auntie
comtesse
mon
dieu
like
one
begging
pardon
of
the
universe
it
is
tenterden
you
understand
making
one
more
of
his
delightful
speeches
to
the
crowd
would
you
be
so
charming
as
to
shut
the
door
this
to
david
in
such
appeal
that
she
is
evidently
making
the
petition
of
her
life
david
saves
her
maggie
determined
not
to
go
under
j
espere
que
vous
trouvez
cette
reunion
interessante
comtesse
vous
parlez
francais
mais
c
est
charmant
voyons
causons
un
peu
tout
de
ce
grand
homme
toutes
les
choses
merveilleuses
qu
il
a
faites
maggie
i
i
je
connais
alas
comtesse
naughtily
forgive
me
mademoiselle
i
thought
you
spoke
french
sybil
who
knows
that
david
admires
her
shoulders
how
wicked
of
you
auntie
to
maggie
i
assure
you
none
of
us
can
understand
her
when
she
gallops
at
that
pace
maggie
crushed
it
doesn
t
matter
i
will
tell
shand
that
you
are
here
sybil
drawling
please
don
t
trouble
him
we
are
really
only
waiting
till
my
brother
recovers
and
can
take
us
back
to
our
hotel
maggie
i
ll
tell
him
she
is
glad
to
disappear
up
the
stair
comtesse
the
lady
seems
distressed
is
she
a
relation
of
shand
david
not
for
to
say
a
relation
she
s
my
sister
our
name
is
wylie
but
granite
quarries
are
nothing
to
them
comtesse
how
do
you
do
you
are
the
committee
man
of
shand
david
no
just
friends
comtesse
gaily
to
the
basins
aha
i
know
you
next
please
sybil
do
you
weigh
yourself
or
are
you
asleep
lady
sybil
has
sunk
indolently
into
a
sybil
not
quite
auntie
comtesse
the
mirror
of
la
politesse
tell
me
all
about
shand
was
it
here
that
he
picked
up
the
pin
david
the
pin
comtesse
as
i
have
read
a
man
always
begins
by
picking
up
a
pin
after
that
as
the
memoirs
say
his
rise
was
rapid
david
however
is
once
more
master
of
himself
and
indeed
has
begun
to
tot
up
the
cost
of
their
garments
david
it
wasn
t
a
pin
he
picked
up
my
lady
it
was
alick
who
feels
that
john
s
greatness
has
been
outside
the
conversation
quite
long
enough
and
his
rise
wasn
t
so
rapid
just
at
first
david
david
he
had
his
fight
his
original
intention
was
to
become
a
minister
he
s
you
know
he
s
not
a
member
alick
with
reverence
he
s
an
but
while
he
was
a
student
he
got
a
place
in
an
s
business
comtesse
now
far
out
of
her
depths
david
they
scrape
boilers
comtesse
i
see
the
fun
men
have
sybil
david
with
some
solemnity
there
have
been
millions
made
in
scraping
boilers
they
say
father
he
went
into
business
so
as
to
be
able
to
pay
off
the
alick
slily
so
i
ve
heard
comtesse
aha
it
was
a
loan
david
and
alick
are
astride
their
great
subject
now
david
no
a
gift
of
a
sort
from
some
but
they
wouldn
t
hear
of
his
paying
it
off
father
alick
not
them
comtesse
restraining
an
impulse
to
think
of
other
things
that
was
kind
charming
alick
with
a
look
at
david
yes
well
my
lady
he
developed
a
perfect
genius
for
the
david
but
his
ambition
wasn
t
satisfied
soon
he
had
public
life
in
his
eye
as
a
heckler
he
was
something
fearsome
they
had
to
seat
him
on
the
platform
for
to
keep
him
quiet
next
they
had
to
let
him
into
the
chair
after
that
he
did
all
the
speaking
he
cleared
all
roads
before
him
like
a
and
when
this
vacancy
occurred
you
could
hardly
say
it
did
occur
so
quickly
did
he
step
into
it
my
lady
there
are
few
more
impressive
sights
in
the
world
than
a
scotsman
on
the
make
comtesse
i
can
well
believe
it
and
now
he
has
said
farewell
to
boilers
david
impressively
not
at
all
the
firm
promised
if
he
was
elected
for
to
make
him
their
london
manager
at
a
year
comtesse
there
is
a
strong
man
for
you
sybil
but
i
believe
you
are
asleep
sybil
stirring
herself
honestly
i
m
not
sweetly
to
the
others
but
would
you
mind
finding
out
whether
my
brother
is
drawing
to
a
close
david
goes
out
leaving
poor
alick
marooned
the
comtesse
is
kind
to
him
comtesse
thank
you
very
much
which
helps
alick
out
don
t
you
love
a
strong
man
sleepy
head
sybil
preening
herself
i
never
met
one
comtesse
neither
have
i
but
if
you
did
meet
one
would
he
wakes
you
up
sybil
i
dare
say
he
would
find
there
were
two
of
us
comtesse
considering
her
yes
i
think
he
would
ever
been
in
love
you
cold
thing
sybil
yawning
i
have
never
shot
up
in
flame
auntie
comtesse
think
you
could
manage
it
sybil
if
mr
right
came
along
comtesse
as
a
girl
of
it
would
be
your
duty
to
tame
him
sybil
as
a
girl
of
i
would
try
to
do
my
duty
comtesse
and
if
it
turned
out
that
he
tamed
you
instead
sybil
he
would
have
to
do
that
if
he
were
my
mr
right
comtesse
and
then
sybil
then
of
course
i
should
adore
him
auntie
i
think
if
i
ever
really
love
it
will
be
like
mary
queen
of
scots
who
said
of
her
bothwell
that
she
could
follow
him
round
the
world
in
her
nighty
comtesse
my
petite
sybil
i
believe
i
mean
it
comtesse
oh
it
is
quite
my
conception
of
your
character
do
you
know
i
am
rather
sorry
for
this
john
shand
sybil
opening
her
fine
eyes
why
he
is
quite
a
boor
is
he
not
comtesse
for
that
very
reason
because
his
great
hour
is
already
nearly
sped
that
wild
bull
manner
that
moves
the
multitude
they
will
laugh
at
it
in
your
house
of
commons
sybil
indifferent
i
suppose
so
comtesse
yet
if
he
had
education
sybil
have
we
not
been
hearing
how
superbly
he
is
educated
comtesse
it
is
such
as
you
or
me
that
he
needs
to
educate
him
now
you
could
do
it
almost
too
well
sybil
with
that
pretty
stretch
of
neck
i
am
not
sufficiently
interested
i
retire
in
your
favour
how
would
you
begin
comtesse
by
asking
him
to
drop
in
about
five
of
course
by
the
way
i
wonder
is
there
a
shand
sybil
i
have
no
idea
but
they
marry
young
comtesse
if
there
is
not
there
is
probably
a
lady
waiting
for
him
somewhere
in
a
boiler
sybil
i
dare
say
maggie
descends
maggie
shand
will
be
down
directly
comtesse
thank
you
your
brother
has
been
giving
us
such
an
interesting
account
of
his
career
i
forget
sybil
whether
he
said
that
he
was
married
maggie
no
he
s
not
married
but
he
will
be
soon
comtesse
ah
she
is
merely
making
conversation
a
friend
of
yours
maggie
now
a
scorner
of
herself
i
don
t
think
much
of
her
comtesse
in
that
case
tell
me
all
about
her
maggie
there
s
not
much
to
tell
she
s
common
and
stupid
one
of
those
who
go
in
for
and
then
when
the
test
comes
they
break
down
with
sinister
enjoyment
she
ll
be
the
ruin
of
him
comtesse
but
is
not
that
sad
figure
to
yourself
how
many
men
with
greatness
before
them
have
been
shipwrecked
by
marrying
in
the
rank
from
which
they
sprang
maggie
i
ve
told
her
that
comtesse
but
she
will
not
give
him
up
maggie
no
sybil
why
should
she
if
he
cares
for
her
what
is
her
name
maggie
it
s
maggie
comtesse
still
uninterested
well
i
am
afraid
that
maggie
is
to
do
for
john
john
comes
down
ah
our
hero
john
sorry
i
have
kept
you
waiting
the
comtesse
comtesse
and
my
niece
lady
sybil
tenterden
sybil
s
head
inclines
on
its
stem
she
is
not
really
all
my
niece
i
mean
i
am
only
half
of
her
aunt
what
a
triumph
shand
john
oh
pretty
fair
pretty
fair
your
brother
has
just
finished
addressing
the
crowd
lady
sybil
sybil
then
we
must
not
detain
shand
auntie
comtesse
who
unless
her
heart
is
touched
thinks
insincerity
charming
only
one
word
i
heard
you
speak
last
night
sublime
just
the
sort
of
impassioned
eloquence
that
your
house
of
commons
loves
john
it
s
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
comtesse
but
we
must
run
bon
soir
sybil
bows
as
to
some
one
far
away
john
lady
sybil
i
hear
you
think
i
m
vulgar
eyebrows
are
raised
comtesse
my
dear
shand
what
absurd
john
i
was
told
she
said
that
after
hearing
me
speak
comtesse
quite
a
mistake
i
john
doggedly
is
it
not
true
sybil
waking
up
you
seem
to
know
shand
and
as
you
press
me
so
unnecessarily
well
yes
that
is
how
you
struck
me
comtesse
my
child
sybil
who
is
a
little
agitated
he
would
have
it
john
perplexed
what
s
the
matter
i
just
wanted
to
know
because
if
it
s
true
i
must
alter
it
comtesse
there
sybil
see
how
he
values
your
good
opinion
sybil
her
svelte
figure
giving
like
a
it
is
very
nice
of
you
to
put
it
in
that
way
shand
forgive
me
john
but
i
don
t
quite
understand
yet
of
course
it
can
t
matter
to
me
lady
sybil
what
you
think
of
me
what
i
mean
is
that
i
mustn
t
be
vulgar
if
it
would
be
injurious
to
my
career
the
regains
its
rigidity
sybil
i
see
no
of
course
i
could
not
affect
your
career
mr
shand
john
who
quite
understands
that
he
is
being
challenged
that
s
so
lady
sybil
meaning
no
offence
sybil
who
has
a
naughty
little
impediment
in
her
voice
when
she
is
most
alluring
of
course
not
and
we
are
friends
again
john
certainly
sybil
then
i
hope
you
will
come
to
see
me
in
london
as
i
present
no
terrors
john
he
is
a
man
is
john
i
ll
be
very
pleased
sybil
any
afternoon
about
five
john
much
obliged
and
you
can
teach
me
the
things
i
don
t
know
yet
if
you
ll
be
so
kind
sybil
the
impediment
becoming
more
assertive
if
you
wish
it
i
shall
do
my
best
john
thank
you
lady
sybil
and
who
knows
there
may
be
one
or
two
things
i
can
teach
you
sybil
it
has
now
become
an
angel
s
hiccough
yes
we
can
help
one
another
till
then
john
maggie
the
ladies
are
going
during
this
skirmish
maggie
has
stood
apart
at
the
mention
of
her
name
they
glance
at
one
another
john
escorts
sybil
but
the
comtesse
turns
back
comtesse
are
you
then
the
maggie
maggie
nods
rather
defiantly
and
the
comtesse
is
distressed
but
if
i
had
known
i
would
not
have
said
those
things
please
forgive
an
old
woman
maggie
it
doesn
t
matter
comtesse
i
i
dare
say
it
will
be
all
right
mademoiselle
if
i
were
you
i
would
not
encourage
those
with
lady
sybil
i
am
the
rude
one
but
she
is
the
dangerous
one
and
i
am
afraid
his
impudence
has
attracted
her
bon
voyage
miss
maggie
maggie
but
i
can
speak
french
je
parle
francais
isn
t
that
right
comtesse
but
yes
it
is
excellent
making
things
easy
for
her
c
est
tres
bien
maggie
je
me
suis
embrouillee
la
derniere
fois
comtesse
good
shall
i
speak
more
slowly
maggie
no
no
nonon
non
faster
faster
comtesse
j
admire
votre
courage
maggie
je
comprends
chaque
mot
comtesse
parfait
bravo
maggie
voila
comtesse
superbe
she
goes
applauding
and
maggie
has
a
moment
of
elation
which
however
has
passed
before
john
returns
for
his
hat
maggie
have
you
more
speaking
to
do
john
he
is
somehow
in
high
john
i
must
run
across
and
address
the
cowcaddens
club
he
sprays
his
throat
with
a
i
wonder
if
i
am
vulgar
maggie
maggie
you
are
not
but
am
john
not
that
can
see
maggie
look
how
overdressed
i
am
john
i
knew
it
was
too
showy
when
i
ordered
it
and
yet
i
could
not
resist
the
thing
but
i
will
tone
it
down
i
will
what
did
you
think
of
lady
sybil
john
that
young
woman
had
better
be
careful
she
s
a
bit
of
a
besom
maggie
maggie
she
s
beautiful
john
john
she
has
a
neat
way
of
stretching
herself
for
playing
with
she
would
do
as
well
as
another
she
looks
at
him
wistfully
maggie
you
couldn
t
stay
and
have
a
talk
for
a
few
minutes
john
if
you
want
me
maggie
the
longer
you
keep
them
waiting
the
more
they
think
of
you
maggie
when
are
you
to
announce
that
we
re
to
be
married
john
john
i
won
t
be
long
you
ve
waited
a
year
more
than
you
need
have
done
so
i
think
it
s
your
due
i
should
hurry
things
now
maggie
i
think
it
s
noble
of
you
john
not
at
all
maggie
the
nobleness
has
been
yours
in
waiting
so
patiently
and
your
brothers
would
insist
on
it
at
any
rate
they
re
watching
me
like
cats
with
a
mouse
maggie
it
s
so
little
i
ve
done
to
help
john
three
hundred
pounds
maggie
i
m
getting
a
thousand
per
cent
for
it
john
and
very
pleased
i
am
you
should
think
so
maggie
maggie
is
it
terrible
hard
to
you
john
john
it
s
not
hard
at
all
i
can
say
truthfully
maggie
that
all
or
nearly
all
i
ve
seen
of
you
in
these
six
years
has
gone
to
increase
my
respect
for
you
maggie
respect
john
and
a
bargain
s
a
bargain
maggie
if
it
wasn
t
that
you
re
so
glorious
to
me
john
i
would
let
you
off
there
is
a
gleam
in
his
eye
but
he
puts
it
out
john
in
my
opinion
maggie
we
ll
be
a
very
happy
pair
she
accepts
this
eagerly
maggie
we
know
each
other
so
well
john
don
t
we
john
i
m
an
extraordinary
queer
character
and
i
suppose
nobody
knows
me
well
except
myself
but
i
know
you
maggie
to
the
very
roots
of
you
she
magnanimously
lets
this
remark
alone
maggie
and
it
s
not
as
if
there
was
any
other
woman
you
fancied
more
john
john
there
s
none
whatever
maggie
if
there
ever
should
be
oh
if
there
ever
should
be
some
woman
with
charm
john
maggie
you
forget
yourself
there
couldn
t
be
another
woman
once
i
was
a
married
man
maggie
one
has
heard
of
such
things
john
not
in
scotsmen
maggie
not
in
scotsmen
maggie
i
ve
sometimes
thought
john
that
the
difference
between
us
and
the
english
is
that
the
scotch
are
hard
in
all
other
respects
but
soft
with
women
and
the
english
are
hard
with
women
but
soft
in
all
other
respects
john
you
ve
forgotten
the
grandest
moral
attribute
of
a
scotsman
maggie
that
he
ll
do
nothing
which
might
damage
his
career
maggie
ah
but
john
whatever
you
do
you
do
it
so
tremendously
and
if
you
were
to
love
what
a
passion
it
would
be
john
there
s
something
in
that
i
suppose
maggie
and
then
what
could
i
do
for
the
desire
of
my
life
now
john
is
to
help
you
to
get
everything
you
want
except
just
that
i
want
you
to
have
me
too
john
we
ll
get
on
fine
maggie
maggie
you
re
just
making
the
best
of
it
they
say
that
love
is
sympathy
and
if
that
s
so
mine
must
be
a
great
love
for
you
for
i
see
all
you
are
feeling
this
night
and
bravely
hiding
i
feel
for
you
as
if
i
was
john
shand
myself
he
sighs
john
i
had
best
go
to
the
meeting
maggie
maggie
not
yet
can
you
look
me
in
the
face
john
and
deny
that
there
is
surging
within
you
a
mighty
desire
to
be
free
to
begin
the
new
life
untrammelled
john
leave
such
maggots
alone
maggie
maggie
it
s
a
shame
of
me
not
to
give
you
up
john
i
would
consider
you
a
very
foolish
woman
if
you
did
maggie
if
i
were
john
shand
i
would
no
more
want
to
take
maggie
wylie
with
me
through
the
beautiful
door
that
has
opened
wide
for
you
than
i
would
want
to
take
an
old
pair
of
shoon
why
don
t
you
bang
the
door
in
my
face
john
a
tremor
runs
through
john
john
a
bargain
s
a
bargain
maggie
maggie
moves
about
an
eerie
figure
breaking
into
little
cries
she
flutters
round
him
threateningly
maggie
say
one
word
about
wanting
to
get
out
of
it
and
i
ll
put
the
lawyers
on
you
john
have
i
hinted
at
such
a
thing
maggie
the
document
holds
you
hard
and
fast
john
it
does
she
gloats
miserably
maggie
the
woman
never
rises
with
the
man
i
ll
drag
you
down
john
i
ll
drag
you
down
john
have
no
fear
of
that
i
won
t
let
you
i
m
too
strong
maggie
you
ll
miss
the
prettiest
thing
in
the
world
and
all
owing
to
me
john
what
s
that
maggie
romance
john
poof
maggie
all
s
cold
and
grey
without
it
john
they
that
have
had
it
have
slipped
in
and
out
of
heaven
john
you
re
exaggerating
maggie
maggie
you
ve
worked
so
hard
you
ve
had
none
of
the
fun
that
comes
to
most
men
long
before
they
re
your
age
john
i
never
was
one
for
fun
i
can
not
call
to
mind
maggie
ever
having
laughed
in
my
life
maggie
you
have
no
sense
of
humour
john
not
a
spark
maggie
i
ve
sometimes
thought
that
if
you
had
it
might
make
you
fonder
of
me
i
think
one
needs
a
sense
of
humour
to
be
fond
of
me
john
i
remember
reading
of
some
one
that
said
it
needed
a
surgical
operation
to
get
a
joke
into
a
scotsman
s
head
maggie
yes
that
s
been
said
john
what
beats
me
maggie
is
how
you
could
insert
a
joke
with
an
operation
he
considers
this
and
gives
it
up
maggie
that
s
not
the
kind
of
fun
i
was
thinking
of
i
mean
fun
with
the
lasses
john
gay
jolly
harmless
fun
they
could
be
impudent
fashionable
beauties
now
stretching
themselves
to
attract
you
like
that
hiccoughing
little
devil
and
running
away
from
you
and
crooking
their
fingers
to
you
to
run
after
them
he
draws
a
big
breath
john
no
i
never
had
that
maggie
it
s
every
man
s
birthright
and
you
would
have
it
now
but
for
me
john
i
can
do
without
maggie
maggie
it
s
like
missing
out
all
the
saturdays
john
you
feel
sure
i
suppose
that
an
older
man
wouldn
t
suit
you
better
maggie
maggie
i
couldn
t
feel
surer
of
anything
you
re
just
my
ideal
john
yes
yes
well
that
s
as
it
should
be
she
threatens
him
again
maggie
david
has
the
document
it
s
carefully
locked
away
john
he
would
naturally
take
good
care
of
it
the
pride
of
the
wylies
deserts
her
maggie
john
i
make
you
a
solemn
promise
that
in
consideration
of
the
circumstances
of
our
marriage
if
you
should
ever
fall
in
love
i
ll
act
differently
from
other
wives
john
there
will
be
no
occasion
maggie
her
voice
becomes
tremulous
maggie
john
david
doesn
t
have
the
document
he
thinks
he
has
but
i
have
it
here
somewhat
heavily
john
surveys
the
fatal
paper
john
well
do
i
mind
the
look
of
it
maggie
yes
yes
that
s
it
umpha
maggie
you
don
t
ask
why
i
ve
brought
it
john
why
did
you
maggie
because
i
thought
i
might
perhaps
have
the
courage
and
the
womanliness
to
give
it
back
to
you
john
has
a
brief
dream
will
you
never
hold
it
up
against
me
in
the
future
that
i
couldn
t
do
that
john
i
promise
you
maggie
i
never
will
maggie
to
go
back
to
the
pans
and
take
up
my
old
life
there
when
all
these
six
years
my
eyes
have
been
centred
on
this
night
i
ve
been
waiting
for
this
night
as
long
as
you
have
been
and
now
to
go
back
there
and
wizen
and
dry
up
when
i
might
be
married
to
john
shand
john
and
you
will
be
maggie
you
have
my
word
maggie
never
never
never
she
tears
up
the
document
he
remains
seated
immovable
but
the
gleam
returns
to
his
eye
she
rages
first
at
herself
and
then
at
him
i
m
a
fool
a
fool
to
let
you
go
i
tell
you
you
ll
rue
this
day
for
you
need
me
you
ll
come
to
grief
without
me
there
s
nobody
can
help
you
as
i
could
have
helped
you
i
m
essential
to
your
career
and
you
re
blind
not
to
see
it
john
what
s
that
maggie
in
no
circumstances
would
i
allow
any
meddling
with
my
career
maggie
you
would
never
have
known
i
was
meddling
with
it
but
that
s
over
don
t
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
marry
john
have
your
fling
with
the
beautiful
dolls
first
get
the
whiphand
of
the
haughty
ones
john
give
them
their
licks
every
time
they
hiccough
let
them
have
an
extra
slap
in
memory
of
me
and
be
sure
to
remember
this
my
man
that
the
one
who
marries
you
will
find
you
out
john
find
me
out
maggie
however
careful
a
man
is
his
wife
always
finds
out
his
failings
john
i
don
t
know
maggie
to
what
failings
you
refer
the
cowcaddens
club
has
burst
its
walls
and
is
pouring
this
way
to
raise
the
new
member
on
its
crest
the
first
wave
hurls
itself
against
the
barber
s
shop
with
cries
of
shand
shand
for
a
moment
john
stems
the
torrent
by
planting
his
back
against
the
door
you
are
acting
under
an
impulse
maggie
and
i
can
t
take
advantage
of
it
think
the
matter
over
and
we
ll
speak
about
it
in
the
morning
maggie
no
i
can
t
go
through
it
again
it
ends
and
now
good
luck
john
she
is
immediately
submerged
in
the
sea
that
surges
through
the
door
bringing
much
wreckage
with
it
in
a
moment
the
place
is
so
full
that
another
cupful
could
not
find
standing
room
some
slippery
ones
are
squeezed
upwards
and
remain
aloft
as
warnings
john
has
jumped
on
to
the
stair
and
harangues
the
flood
vainly
like
another
canute
it
is
something
about
freedom
and
noble
minds
and
though
unheard
goes
to
all
heads
including
the
speaker
s
by
the
time
he
is
audible
sentiment
has
him
for
her
own
john
but
gentlemen
one
may
have
too
much
even
of
freedom
no
no
yes
adamson
one
may
want
to
be
tied
never
never
i
say
yes
willie
cameron
and
i
have
found
a
young
lady
who
i
am
proud
to
say

willing
to
be
tied

queer
little
elated
figure

raised
aloft
with
her
fingers
she
can
just
touch
the
stars
not
unconscious
of
the
nobility
of
his
behaviour
the
hero
of

evening

an
impressive
finger
at

the
heroine
of

evening
surprises
him
maggie
i
can
make
a
speech
and
i
will
make
a
speech
and
it
s
in
two
words
and

arms
to
enfold
all
the
members

dementia
act
iii
a
few
minutes
ago
the
comtesse
de
la
briere
who
has
not
recently
been
in
england
was
shown
into
the
london
home
of
the
shands
though
not
sufficiently
interested
to
express
her
surprise
in
words
she
raised
her
eyebrows
on
finding
herself
in
a
charming
room
she
has
presumed
that
the
shand
scheme
of
decoration
would
be
as
impossible
as
themselves
it
is
the
little
room
behind
the
for
which
english
architects
have
long
been
famous
make
something
of
this
and
you
will
indeed
be
a
clever
one
they
seem
to
say
to
you
as
they
unveil
it
the
comtesse
finds
that
john
has
undoubtedly
made
something
of
it
it
is
his
study
mon
dieu
the
words
these
english
use
and
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
offends
there
is
so
much
not
in
it
too
that
might
so
easily
have
been
there
it
is
not
in
the
least
ornate
there
are
no
colours
quarrelling
with
each
other
unseen
unheard
by
the
blissful
occupant
of
the
revolving
chair
the
comtesse
has
not
even
the
gentle
satisfaction
of
noting
a
suite
in
stained
oak
nature
might
have
taken
a
share
in
the
decorations
so
restful
are
they
to
the
eyes
it
is
the
working
room
of
a
man
of
culture
probably
lately
down
from
oxford
at
a
first
meeting
there
is
nothing
in
it
that
pretends
to
be
what
it
is
not
our
visitor
is
a
little
disappointed
but
being
blows
her
absent
host
a
kiss
for
disappointing
her
he
has
even
she
observes
with
a
twinkle
made
something
of
the
most
difficult
of
his
possessions
the
little
wife
for
maggie
who
is
here
receiving
her
has
been
quite
creditably
toned
down
he
has
put
her
into
a
little
grey
frock
that
not
only
deals
gently
with
her
personal
defects
but
is
in
harmony
with
the
room
evidently
however
she
has
not
risen
with
him
for
she
is
as
ever
the
comtesse
who
remembers
having
liked
her
the
better
of
the
two
could
shake
her
for
being
so
stupid
for
instance
why
is
she
not
asserting
herself
in
that
other
apartment
the
other
apartment
is
really
a
correctly
solemn
of
which
we
have
a
glimpse
through
partly
open
at
this
moment
it
is
harbouring
shand
s
ladies
committee
who
sit
with
pens
and
foolscap
round
the
large
table
awaiting
the
advent
of
their
leader
there
are
nobly
wise
ones
and
some
foolish
ones
among
them
for
we
are
back
in
the
strange
days
when
it
was
considered
unwomanly
for
women
to
have
minds
the
comtesse
peeps
at
them
with
curiosity
as
they
arrange
their
papers
or
are
ushered
into
the
through
a
door
which
we
can
not
see
to
her
frivolous
ladyship
they
are
a
species
of
wild
fowl
and
she
is
specially
amused
to
find
her
niece
among
them
she
demands
an
explanation
as
soon
as
the
communicating
doors
close
comtesse
tell
me
since
when
has
my
dear
sybil
become
one
of
these
ladies
it
is
not
like
her
maggie
is
obviously
not
clever
enough
to
understand
the
woman
question
her
eye
rests
longingly
on
a
stocking
as
she
innocently
but
densely
replies
maggie
i
think
it
was
about
the
time
that
my
husband
took
up
their
cause
the
comtesse
has
been
hearing
tales
of
lady
sybil
and
the
barbarian
and
after
having
the
grace
to
hesitate
she
speaks
with
the
directness
for
which
she
is
famed
in
mayfair
comtesse
shand
excuse
me
for
saying
that
if
half
of
what
i
hear
be
true
your
husband
is
seeing
that
lady
a
great
deal
too
often
maggie
is
expressionless
she
reaches
for
her
stocking
whereat
her
guest
loses
patience
oh
mon
dieu
put
that
down
you
can
buy
them
at
two
francs
the
pair
shand
why
do
not
you
compel
yourself
to
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
your
husband
s
work
maggie
i
typewrite
his
speeches
comtesse
but
do
you
know
what
they
are
about
maggie
they
are
about
various
subjects
comtesse
oh
did
maggie
give
her
an
unseen
quizzical
glance
before
demurely
resuming
the
knitting
one
is
not
certain
as
john
has
come
in
and
this
obliterates
her
a
scotsman
on
the
make
of
whom
david
has
spoken
reverently
is
still
to
be
read
in
a
somewhat
better
bound
volume
in
john
shand
s
person
but
it
is
as
doggedly
honest
a
face
as
ever
and
he
champions
women
not
for
personal
ends
but
because
his
blessed
days
of
poverty
gave
him
a
light
upon
their
needs
his
however
has
increased
and
he
has
pleasantly
forgotten
some
things
for
instance
he
can
now
call
out
porter
at
railway
stations
without
dropping
his
hands
for
the
barrow
maggie
introduces
the
comtesse
and
he
is
still
undaunted
john
i
remember
you
well
at
glasgow
comtesse
it
must
be
quite
two
years
ago
shand
john
has
no
objection
to
showing
that
he
has
had
a
classical
education
john
tempus
fugit
comtesse
comtesse
i
have
not
been
much
in
this
country
since
then
and
i
return
to
find
you
a
coming
man
fortunately
his
learning
is
tempered
with
modesty
john
oh
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
know
comtesse
the
ladies
champion
his
modesty
is
tempered
with
a
respect
for
truth
john
well
well
comtesse
and
you
are
about
as
i
understand
to
introduce
a
bill
to
give
women
an
equal
right
with
men
to
grow
beards
which
is
all
she
knows
about
it
he
takes
the
remark
literally
john
there
s
nothing
about
beards
in
it
comtesse
she
gives
him
time
to
cogitate
and
is
pleased
to
note
that
there
is
no
result
have
you
typed
my
speech
maggie
maggie
yes
pages
she
produces
it
from
a
drawer
perhaps
john
wishes
to
impress
the
visitor
john
i
m
to
give
the
ladies
committee
a
general
idea
of
it
just
see
maggie
if
i
know
the
peroration
in
conclusion
speaker
these
are
the
reasonable
demands
of
every
intelligent
englishwoman
i
had
better
say
british
woman
and
i
am
proud
to
nail
them
to
my
flag
the
visitor
is
properly
impressed
comtesse
oho
defies
his
leaders
john
so
long
as
i
can
do
so
without
embarrassing
the
comtesse
ah
ah
shand
john
i
call
upon
the
front
bench
sir
loyally
but
firmly
comtesse
firm
again
john
either
to
accept
my
bill
or
to
promise
without
delay
to
bring
in
one
of
their
own
and
if
they
decline
to
do
so
i
solemnly
warn
them
that
though
i
will
not
press
the
matter
to
a
division
just
now
comtesse
ahem
john
i
will
bring
it
forward
again
in
the
near
and
now
comtesse
you
know
that
i
m
not
going
to
divide
and
not
another
soul
knows
it
comtesse
i
am
indeed
flattered
by
your
confidence
john
i
ve
only
told
you
because
i
don
t
care
who
knows
now
comtesse
oh
somehow
maggie
seems
to
be
dissatisfied
maggie
but
why
is
that
john
john
i
daren
t
keep
the
government
in
doubt
any
longer
about
what
i
mean
to
do
i
ll
show
the
whips
the
speech
privately
maggie
who
still
wants
to
know
but
not
to
go
to
a
division
is
hedging
isn
t
it
is
that
strong
john
to
make
the
speech
at
all
maggie
is
stronger
than
most
would
dare
they
would
do
for
me
if
i
went
to
a
division
maggie
bark
but
not
bite
john
now
now
maggie
you
re
out
of
your
depth
maggie
i
suppose
that
s
it
the
comtesse
remains
in
the
shallows
comtesse
but
what
will
the
ladies
say
shand
john
they
won
t
like
it
comtesse
but
they
ve
got
to
lump
it
here
the
maid
appears
with
a
card
for
maggie
who
considers
it
quietly
john
any
one
of
importance
maggie
no
john
then
i
m
ready
maggie
this
is
evidently
an
intimation
that
she
is
to
open
the
and
he
makes
an
effective
entrance
into
the
his
thumb
in
his
waistcoat
there
is
a
delicious
clapping
of
hands
from
the
committee
and
the
door
closes
not
till
then
does
maggie
who
has
grown
thoughtful
tell
her
maid
to
admit
the
visitor
comtesse
another
lady
shand
maggie
the
card
says
mr
charles
the
comtesse
is
really
interested
at
last
comtesse
charles
venables
do
you
know
him
maggie
i
think
i
call
to
mind
meeting
one
of
that
name
at
the
foreign
office
party
comtesse
one
of
that
name
he
who
is
a
minister
of
your
cabinet
but
as
you
know
him
so
little
why
should
he
call
on
you
maggie
i
wonder
maggie
s
glance
wanders
to
the
drawer
in
which
she
has
replaced
john
s
speech
comtesse
well
well
i
shall
take
care
of
you
petite
maggie
do
you
know
him
comtesse
do
i
know
him
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
asked
me
to
to
hem
ma
cherie
it
was
thirty
years
ago
maggie
thirty
years
comtesse
i
was
a
pretty
woman
then
i
dare
say
i
shall
detest
him
now
but
if
i
find
i
do
not
let
us
have
a
little
plot
i
shall
drop
this
book
and
then
perhaps
you
will
be
so
charming
as
as
not
to
be
here
for
a
little
while
venables
who
enters
is
such
a
courtly
seigneur
that
he
seems
to
bring
the
eighteenth
century
with
him
you
feel
that
his
sedan
chair
is
at
the
door
he
stoops
over
maggie
s
plebeian
hand
venables
i
hope
you
will
pardon
my
calling
shand
we
had
such
a
pleasant
talk
the
other
evening
maggie
of
course
is
at
once
deceived
by
his
gracious
manner
maggie
i
think
it
s
kind
of
you
do
you
know
each
other
the
comtesse
de
la
briere
he
repeats
the
name
with
some
emotion
and
the
comtesse
half
mischievously
half
sadly
holds
a
hand
before
her
face
venables
comtesse
comtesse
thirty
years
venables
he
gallantly
removes
the
hand
that
screens
her
face
venables
it
does
not
seem
so
much
she
gives
him
a
similar
scrutiny
comtesse
mon
dieu
it
seems
all
that
they
smile
rather
ruefully
maggie
like
a
kind
hostess
relieves
the
tension
maggie
the
comtesse
has
taken
a
cottage
in
surrey
for
the
summer
venables
i
am
overjoyed
comtesse
no
charles
you
are
not
you
no
longer
care
fickle
one
and
it
is
only
thirty
years
he
sinks
into
a
chair
beside
her
venables
those
heavenly
evenings
comtesse
on
the
bosphorus
comtesse
i
refuse
to
talk
of
them
i
hate
you
but
she
drops
the
book
and
maggie
fades
from
the
room
it
is
not
a
very
clever
departure
and
the
old
diplomatist
smiles
then
he
sighs
a
beautiful
sigh
for
he
does
all
things
beautifully
venables
it
is
moonlight
comtesse
on
the
golden
horn
comtesse
who
are
those
two
young
things
in
a
caique
venables
is
he
the
brave
leander
comtesse
and
is
she
hero
of
the
lamp
comtesse
no
she
is
the
foolish
wife
of
the
french
ambassador
and
he
is
a
british
attache
trying
to
get
her
husband
s
secrets
out
of
her
venables
is
it
possible
they
part
at
a
certain
garden
gate
comtesse
oh
charles
charles
venables
but
you
promised
to
come
back
i
waited
there
till
dawn
blanche
if
you
had
come
back
comtesse
how
is
venables
venables
she
is
rather
poorly
i
think
it
s
gout
comtesse
and
you
venables
i
creak
a
little
in
the
mornings
comtesse
so
do
i
there
is
such
a
good
man
at
wiesbaden
venables
the
homburg
fellow
is
better
the
way
he
patched
me
up
last
summer
oh
lord
lord
comtesse
yes
charles
the
game
is
up
we
are
two
old
fogies
they
groan
in
unison
then
she
raps
him
sharply
on
the
knuckles
tell
me
sir
what
are
you
doing
here
venables
merely
a
friendly
call
comtesse
i
do
not
believe
it
venables
the
same
woman
the
old
delightful
candour
comtesse
the
same
man
the
old
fibs
she
sees
that
the
door
is
asking
a
question
yes
come
shand
i
have
had
quite
enough
of
him
i
warn
you
he
is
here
for
some
crafty
purpose
maggie
drawing
back
timidly
surely
not
venables
really
comtesse
you
make
conversation
difficult
to
show
that
my
intentions
are
innocent
shand
i
propose
that
you
choose
the
subject
maggie
relieved
there
comtesse
venables
i
hope
your
husband
is
well
maggie
yes
thank
you
with
a
happy
thought
i
decide
that
we
talk
about
him
venables
if
you
wish
it
comtesse
be
careful
he
has
chosen
the
subject
maggie
chose
it
didn
t
i
venables
you
know
you
did
maggie
appealingly
you
admire
john
venables
very
much
but
he
puzzles
me
a
little
you
scots
shand
are
such
a
mixture
of
the
practical
and
the
emotional
that
you
escape
out
of
an
englishman
s
hand
like
a
trout
maggie
do
we
venables
well
not
you
but
your
husband
i
have
known
few
men
make
a
worse
beginning
in
the
house
he
had
the
most
atrocious
manner
comtesse
i
remember
that
manner
maggie
no
he
hadn
t
venables
soothingly
at
first
but
by
his
second
session
he
had
shed
all
that
and
he
is
now
a
pleasure
to
listen
to
by
the
way
comtesse
have
you
found
any
dark
intention
in
that
comtesse
you
wanted
to
know
whether
he
talks
over
these
matter
with
his
wife
and
she
has
told
you
that
he
does
not
maggie
indignantly
i
haven
t
said
a
word
about
it
have
i
venables
not
a
word
then
again
i
admire
him
for
his
impromptu
speeches
maggie
what
is
impromptu
venables
unprepared
they
have
contained
some
grave
blunders
not
so
much
of
judgment
as
of
taste
maggie
hotly
don
t
think
so
venables
pardon
me
but
he
has
righted
himself
subsequently
in
the
neatest
way
i
have
always
found
that
the
man
whose
second
thoughts
are
good
is
worth
watching
well
comtesse
i
see
you
have
something
to
say
comtesse
you
are
wondering
whether
she
can
tell
you
who
gives
him
his
second
thoughts
maggie
gives
them
to
john
i
would
like
to
see
anybody
try
to
give
thoughts
to
john
venables
quite
so
comtesse
is
there
anything
more
that
has
roused
your
admiration
charles
venables
purring
let
me
see
yes
we
are
all
much
edified
by
his
humour
comtesse
surprised
indeed
his
humour
that
man
maggie
with
hauteur
why
not
venables
i
assure
you
comtesse
some
of
the
neat
things
in
his
speeches
convulse
the
house
a
word
has
even
been
coined
for
them
shandisms
comtesse
slowly
recovering
from
a
blow
humour
venables
in
conversation
i
admit
he
strikes
one
as
being
ah
somewhat
lacking
in
humour
comtesse
pouncing
you
are
wondering
who
supplies
his
speeches
with
the
humour
maggie
supplies
john
venables
now
that
you
mention
it
some
of
his
shandisms
do
have
a
curiously
feminine
quality
comtesse
you
have
thought
it
might
be
a
woman
venables
really
comtesse
comtesse
i
see
it
all
charles
you
thought
it
might
be
the
wife
venables
flinging
up
his
hands
i
own
up
maggie
bewildered
me
venables
forgive
me
i
see
i
was
wrong
maggie
alarmed
have
i
been
doing
john
any
harm
venables
on
the
contrary
i
am
relieved
to
know
that
there
are
no
hairpins
in
his
speeches
if
he
is
at
home
shand
may
i
see
him
i
am
going
to
be
rather
charming
to
him
maggie
drawn
in
two
directions
yes
he
is
oh
yes
but
venables
that
is
to
say
comtesse
if
he
proves
himself
the
man
i
believe
him
to
be
this
arrests
maggie
almost
as
she
has
reached
the
door
maggie
hesitating
he
is
very
busy
just
now
venables
smiling
i
think
he
will
see
me
maggie
is
it
something
about
his
speech
venables
the
smile
hardening
well
yes
it
is
maggie
then
i
dare
say
i
could
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
without
troubling
him
as
i
ve
been
typing
it
venables
with
a
sigh
i
don
t
acquire
information
in
that
way
comtesse
i
trust
not
maggie
there
s
no
secret
about
it
he
is
to
show
it
to
the
whips
tonight
venables
sharply
you
are
sure
of
that
comtesse
it
is
quite
true
charles
i
heard
him
say
so
and
indeed
he
repeated
what
he
called
the
peroration
before
me
maggie
i
know
it
by
heart
she
plays
a
bold
game
these
are
the
demands
of
all
intelligent
british
women
and
i
am
proud
to
nail
them
to
my
flag
comtesse
the
very
words
shand
maggie
looking
at
her
imploringly
and
i
don
t
care
how
they
may
embarrass
the
the
comtesse
is
bereft
of
speech
so
suddenly
has
she
been
introduced
to
the
real
maggie
shand
if
the
right
honourable
gentleman
will
give
us
his
pledge
to
introduce
a
similar
bill
this
session
i
will
willingly
withdraw
mine
but
otherwise
i
solemnly
warn
him
that
i
will
press
the
matter
now
to
a
she
turns
her
face
from
the
great
man
she
has
gone
white
venables
after
a
pause
capital
the
blood
returns
to
maggie
s
heart
comtesse
who
is
beginning
to
enjoy
herself
very
much
then
you
are
pleased
to
know
that
he
means
to
as
you
say
go
to
a
division
venables
delighted
the
courage
of
it
will
be
the
making
of
him
comtesse
i
see
venables
had
he
been
to
hedge
we
should
have
known
that
he
was
a
pasteboard
knight
and
have
disregarded
him
comtesse
i
see
she
desires
to
catch
the
eye
of
maggie
but
it
is
carefully
turned
from
her
venables
shand
let
us
have
him
in
at
once
comtesse
yes
yes
indeed
maggie
s
anxiety
returns
but
she
has
to
call
john
in
john
impressed
venables
this
is
an
honour
venables
how
are
you
shand
john
sit
down
sit
down
becoming
himself
again
i
can
guess
what
you
have
come
about
venables
ah
you
scotsmen
john
of
course
i
know
i
m
harassing
the
government
a
good
deal
venables
blandly
not
at
all
shand
the
government
are
very
pleased
john
you
don
t
expect
me
to
believe
that
venables
i
called
here
to
give
you
the
proof
of
it
you
may
know
that
we
are
to
have
a
big
meeting
at
leeds
on
the
when
two
ministers
are
to
speak
there
is
room
for
a
third
speaker
and
i
am
authorised
to
offer
that
place
to
you
john
to
me
venables
yes
john
swelling
it
would
be
the
government
taking
me
up
venables
don
t
make
too
much
of
it
it
would
be
an
acknowledgment
that
they
look
upon
you
as
one
of
their
likely
young
men
maggie
john
john
not
found
wanting
in
a
trying
hour
it
s
a
bribe
you
are
offering
me
this
on
condition
that
i
don
t
make
my
speech
how
can
you
think
so
meanly
of
me
as
to
believe
that
i
would
play
the
women
s
cause
false
for
the
sake
of
my
own
advancement
i
refuse
your
bribe
venables
liking
him
for
the
first
time
good
but
you
are
wrong
there
are
no
conditions
and
we
want
you
to
make
your
speech
now
do
you
accept
john
still
suspicious
if
you
make
me
the
same
offer
after
you
have
read
it
i
insist
on
your
reading
it
first
venables
sighing
by
all
means
maggie
is
in
an
agony
as
she
sees
john
hand
the
speech
to
his
leader
on
the
other
hand
the
comtesse
thrills
but
i
assure
you
we
look
on
the
speech
as
a
small
matter
the
important
thing
is
your
intention
of
going
to
a
division
and
we
agree
to
that
also
john
losing
his
head
what
s
that
venables
yes
we
agree
john
but
but
why
you
have
been
threatening
to
excommunicate
me
if
i
dared
venables
all
done
to
test
you
shand
john
to
test
me
venables
we
know
that
a
division
on
your
bill
can
have
no
serious
significance
we
shall
see
to
that
and
so
the
test
was
to
be
whether
you
had
the
pluck
to
divide
the
house
had
you
been
intending
to
talk
big
in
this
speech
and
then
hedge
through
fear
of
the
government
they
would
have
had
no
further
use
for
you
john
heavily
i
understand
but
there
is
one
thing
he
can
not
understand
which
is
why
venables
should
be
so
sure
that
he
is
not
to
hedge
venables
turning
over
the
pages
carelessly
any
of
your
good
things
in
this
shand
john
whose
one
desire
is
to
get
the
pages
back
no
i
no
it
isn
t
necessary
you
should
read
it
now
venables
from
politeness
only
merely
for
my
own
pleasure
i
shall
look
through
it
this
evening
he
rolls
up
the
speech
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
john
turns
despairingly
to
maggie
though
well
aware
that
no
help
can
come
from
her
maggie
that
s
the
only
copy
there
is
john
to
venables
let
me
make
a
fresh
one
and
send
it
to
you
in
an
hour
or
two
venables
i
could
not
put
you
to
that
trouble
shand
i
will
take
good
care
of
it
maggie
if
anything
were
to
happen
to
you
on
the
way
home
wouldn
t
whatever
is
in
your
pocket
be
considered
to
be
the
property
of
your
heirs
venables
laughing
now
there
is
forethought
shand
i
think
that
after
that
he
returns
the
speech
to
john
whose
hand
swallows
it
greedily
she
is
scotch
too
comtesse
comtesse
delighted
yes
she
is
scotch
too
venables
though
the
only
persons
likely
to
do
for
me
in
the
street
shand
are
your
ladies
committee
ever
since
they
took
the
horse
out
of
my
brougham
i
can
scent
them
a
mile
away
comtesse
a
mile
charles
peep
in
there
he
softly
turns
the
handle
of
the
door
and
realises
that
his
scent
is
not
so
good
as
he
had
thought
it
he
bids
his
hostess
and
the
comtesse
in
a
burlesque
whisper
and
tiptoes
off
to
safer
places
john
having
gone
out
with
him
maggie
can
no
longer
avoid
the
comtesse
s
reproachful
eye
that
much
injured
lady
advances
upon
her
with
accusing
finger
comtesse
so
madam
maggie
is
prepared
for
her
maggie
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
comtesse
yes
you
do
i
mean
that
there
is
some
one
who
helps
our
shand
maggie
there
s
not
comtesse
and
it
is
a
woman
and
it
s
you
maggie
i
help
in
the
little
things
comtesse
the
little
things
you
are
the
pin
he
picked
up
and
that
is
to
make
his
fortune
and
now
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
your
john
is
aware
that
you
help
at
all
john
returns
and
at
once
provides
the
answer
john
maggie
comtesse
i
ve
done
it
again
maggie
i
m
so
glad
john
the
comtesse
is
in
an
ecstasy
comtesse
and
all
because
you
were
not
to
hedge
shand
his
appeal
to
her
with
the
wistfulness
of
a
schoolboy
makes
him
rather
attractive
john
you
won
t
tell
on
me
comtesse
he
thinks
it
out
they
had
just
guessed
i
would
be
firm
because
they
know
i
m
a
strong
man
you
little
saw
maggie
what
a
good
turn
you
were
doing
me
when
you
said
you
wanted
to
make
another
copy
of
the
speech
she
is
dense
maggie
how
john
john
because
now
i
can
alter
the
end
she
is
enlightened
maggie
so
you
can
john
here
s
another
lucky
thing
maggie
i
hadn
t
told
the
ladies
committee
that
i
was
to
hedge
and
so
they
need
never
know
comtesse
i
tell
you
there
s
a
little
cherub
who
sits
up
aloft
and
looks
after
the
career
of
john
shand
the
comtesse
looks
not
aloft
but
toward
the
chair
at
present
occupied
by
maggie
comtesse
where
does
she
sit
shand
he
knows
that
women
are
not
well
read
john
it
s
just
a
figure
of
speech
he
returns
airily
to
his
committee
room
and
now
again
you
may
hear
the
click
of
maggie
s
needles
they
no
longer
annoy
the
comtesse
she
is
setting
them
to
music
comtesse
it
is
not
down
here
she
sits
shand
knitting
a
stocking
maggie
no
it
isn
t
comtesse
and
when
i
came
in
i
gave
him
credit
for
everything
even
for
the
prettiness
of
the
room
maggie
he
has
beautiful
taste
comtesse
scotchy
maggie
comtesse
and
thank
you
for
coming
comtesse
miss
pin
maggie
rings
genteelly
maggie
the
comtesse
is
now
lost
in
admiration
of
her
comtesse
you
divine
little
wife
he
can
t
be
worthy
of
it
no
man
could
be
worthy
of
it
why
do
you
do
it
maggie
shivers
a
little
maggie
he
loves
to
think
he
does
it
all
himself
that
s
the
way
of
men
i
m
six
years
older
than
he
is
i
m
plain
and
i
have
no
charm
i
shouldn
t
have
let
him
marry
me
i
m
trying
to
make
up
for
it
the
comtesse
kisses
her
and
goes
away
maggie
somewhat
foolishly
resumes
her
knitting
some
days
later
this
same
room
is
listening
with
the
same
inattention
to
the
outpouring
of
john
shand
s
love
for
the
lady
of
the
hiccoughs
we
arrive
by
arrangement
rather
late
and
thus
we
miss
some
of
the
most
delightful
of
the
pangs
one
can
see
that
these
two
are
playing
no
game
or
if
they
are
that
they
little
know
it
the
wonders
of
the
world
so
strange
are
the
instruments
chosen
by
love
have
been
revealed
to
john
in
hiccoughs
he
shakes
in
sybil
s
presence
never
were
more
swimming
eyes
he
who
has
been
of
a
wooden
face
till
now
with
ways
to
match
has
gone
on
flame
like
a
piece
of
paper
emotion
is
in
flood
in
him
we
may
be
almost
fond
of
john
for
being
so
worshipful
of
love
much
has
come
to
him
that
we
had
almost
despaired
of
his
acquiring
including
nearly
all
the
divine
attributes
except
that
sense
of
humour
the
beautiful
sybil
has
always
possessed
but
little
of
it
also
and
what
she
had
has
been
struck
from
her
by
cupid
s
flail
naked
of
the
saving
grace
they
face
each
other
in
awful
rapture
john
in
a
room
sybil
i
go
to
you
as
a
cold
man
to
a
fire
you
fill
me
like
a
peal
of
bells
in
an
empty
house
she
is
being
brutally
treated
by
the
dear
impediment
for
which
hiccough
is
such
an
inadequate
name
that
even
to
spell
it
is
an
abomination
though
a
sign
of
ability
how
to
describe
a
sound
that
is
noiseless
let
us
put
it
thus
that
when
sybil
wants
to
say
something
very
much
there
are
little
obstacles
in
her
way
she
falters
falls
perhaps
once
and
then
is
over
the
while
her
appealing
orbs
beg
you
not
to
be
angry
with
her
we
may
express
those
sweet
pauses
in
precious
dots
which
some
clever
person
can
afterwards
string
together
and
make
a
pearl
necklace
of
them
sybil
i
should
not
let
you
say
it
but
you
say
it
so
beautifully
john
you
must
have
guessed
sybil
i
dreamed
i
feared
but
you
were
scotch
and
i
didn
t
know
what
to
think
john
do
you
know
what
first
attracted
me
to
you
sybil
it
was
your
insolence
i
thought
i
ll
break
her
insolence
for
sybil
and
i
thought
i
ll
break
his
str
ength
john
and
now
your
cooing
voice
plays
round
me
the
softness
of
you
sybil
in
your
pretty
clothes
makes
me
think
of
young
birds
the
impediment
is
now
insurmountable
she
has
to
swim
for
it
she
swims
toward
him
it
is
you
who
inspire
my
work
he
thrills
to
find
that
she
can
be
touched
without
breaking
sybil
i
am
so
glad
so
proud
john
and
others
know
it
sybil
as
well
as
i
only
yesterday
the
comtesse
said
to
me
no
man
could
get
on
so
fast
unaided
cherchez
la
femme
sybil
auntie
said
that
john
i
said
find
her
yourself
sybil
and
she
john
she
said
i
have
found
her
and
i
said
in
my
blunt
way
you
mean
lady
sybil
and
she
went
away
laughing
sybil
laughing
john
i
seem
to
amuse
the
woman
sybil
grows
sad
sybil
if
shand
it
is
so
cruel
to
her
whom
did
you
say
she
had
gone
to
the
station
to
meet
john
her
father
and
brothers
sybil
it
is
so
cruel
to
them
we
must
think
no
more
of
this
it
is
mad
ness
john
it
s
fate
sybil
let
us
declare
our
love
openly
sybil
you
can
t
ask
that
now
in
the
first
moment
that
you
tell
me
of
it
john
the
one
thing
i
won
t
do
even
for
you
is
to
live
a
life
of
underhand
sybil
the
blow
to
her
john
yes
but
at
least
she
has
always
known
that
i
never
loved
her
sybil
it
is
asking
me
to
give
up
everything
every
one
for
you
john
it
s
too
much
john
is
humble
at
last
sybil
to
a
woman
who
truly
loves
even
that
is
not
too
much
oh
it
is
not
i
who
matter
it
is
you
john
my
dear
my
dear
sybil
so
gladly
would
i
do
it
to
save
you
but
oh
if
it
were
to
bring
you
down
john
nothing
can
keep
me
down
if
i
have
you
to
help
me
sybil
i
am
dazed
john
i
john
my
love
my
love
sybil
i
oh
here
john
be
brave
sybil
be
brave
sybil
in
this
bewilderment
of
pearls
she
melts
into
his
arms
maggie
happens
to
open
the
door
just
then
but
neither
fond
heart
hears
her
john
i
can
t
walk
along
the
streets
sybil
without
looking
in
all
the
shop
windows
for
what
i
think
would
become
you
best
as
awkwardly
as
though
his
heart
still
beat
against
corduroy
he
takes
from
his
pocket
a
pendant
and
its
chain
he
is
shy
and
she
drops
pearls
over
the
beauty
of
the
ruby
which
is
its
only
stone
it
is
a
drop
of
my
blood
sybil
her
lovely
neck
is
outstretched
and
he
puts
the
chain
round
it
maggie
withdraws
as
silently
as
she
had
come
but
perhaps
the
door
whispered
d
n
as
it
closed
for
sybil
wakes
out
of
paradise
sybil
i
thought
the
door
shut
john
it
was
shut
already
perhaps
it
is
only
that
sybil
is
bewildered
to
find
herself
once
again
in
a
world
that
has
doors
sybil
it
seemed
to
me
john
there
was
nothing
but
i
think
i
hear
voices
they
may
have
arrived
some
pretty
instinct
makes
sybil
go
farther
from
him
maggie
kindly
gives
her
time
for
this
by
speaking
before
opening
the
door
maggie
that
will
do
perfectly
david
the
maid
knows
where
to
put
them
she
comes
in
they
ve
come
john
they
would
help
with
the
luggage
john
goes
out
maggie
is
agreeably
surprised
to
find
a
visitor
how
do
you
do
lady
sybil
this
is
nice
of
you
sybil
i
was
so
sorry
not
to
find
you
in
shand
the
impediment
has
run
away
it
is
only
for
those
who
love
it
maggie
thank
you
you
ll
sit
down
sybil
i
think
not
your
relatives
maggie
they
will
be
so
proud
to
see
that
you
are
my
friend
if
maggie
were
less
simple
her
guest
would
feel
more
comfortable
she
tries
to
make
conversation
sybil
it
is
their
first
visit
to
london
instead
of
relieving
her
anxiety
on
this
point
maggie
has
a
long
look
at
the
gorgeous
armful
maggie
i
m
glad
you
are
so
beautiful
lady
sybil
the
beautiful
one
is
somehow
not
flattered
she
pursues
her
investigations
with
growing
uneasiness
sybil
one
of
them
is
married
now
isn
t
he
still
there
is
no
answer
maggie
continues
looking
at
her
and
shivers
slightly
have
they
travelled
from
scotland
shand
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
the
door
did
open
maggie
nods
what
are
you
to
do
maggie
that
would
be
telling
sit
down
my
pretty
as
sybil
subsides
into
what
the
wylies
with
one
glance
would
call
the
best
chair
maggie
s
are
brought
in
by
john
all
carrying
silk
hats
and
looking
very
active
after
their
long
rest
in
the
train
they
are
gazing
about
them
they
would
like
this
lady
they
would
like
john
they
would
even
like
maggie
to
go
away
for
a
little
and
leave
them
to
examine
the
room
is
that
linen
on
the
walls
for
instance
or
just
paper
is
the
carpet
as
thick
as
it
feels
or
is
there
brown
paper
beneath
it
had
maggie
got
anything
off
that
bookcase
on
account
of
the
david
even
discovers
that
we
were
simpletons
when
we
said
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
that
pretended
to
be
what
it
was
not
he
taps
the
marble
mantelpiece
and
is
favourably
impressed
by
the
tinny
sound
david
very
fine
imitation
it
s
a
capital
house
maggie
maggie
i
m
so
glad
you
like
it
do
you
know
one
another
this
is
my
father
and
my
brothers
lady
sybil
the
lovely
form
inclines
towards
them
alick
and
david
remain
firm
on
their
legs
but
james
totters
james
a
ladyship
well
done
maggie
alick
sharply
james
i
remember
you
my
lady
maggie
sit
down
father
this
is
the
study
james
wanders
round
it
inquisitively
until
called
to
order
sybil
you
must
be
tired
after
your
long
journey
david
drawing
the
portraits
of
himself
and
partners
in
one
lightning
sketch
tired
your
ladyship
we
sat
on
cushioned
seats
the
whole
way
james
looking
about
him
for
the
chair
you
sit
on
every
seat
in
this
room
is
cushioned
maggie
you
may
say
all
my
life
is
cushioned
now
james
by
this
dear
man
of
mine
she
gives
john
s
shoulder
a
loving
pressure
which
sybil
feels
is
a
telegraphic
communication
to
herself
in
a
cypher
that
she
can
not
read
alick
and
the
brothers
bask
in
the
evidence
of
maggie
s
happiness
john
uncomfortably
and
is
elizabeth
hearty
james
james
looking
down
his
nose
in
the
manner
proper
to
young
husbands
when
addressed
about
their
wives
she
s
very
well
i
thank
you
kindly
maggie
james
is
a
married
man
now
lady
sybil
sybil
murmurs
her
congratulations
james
i
thank
you
kindly
courageously
yes
i
m
married
he
looks
at
david
and
alick
to
see
if
they
are
smiling
and
they
are
it
wasn
t
a
case
of
being
catched
it
was
entirely
of
my
own
free
will
he
looks
again
and
the
mean
fellows
are
smiling
still
is
your
ladyship
married
sybil
alas
no
david
james
politely
you
will
be
yet
my
lady
sybil
indicates
that
he
is
kind
indeed
john
perhaps
they
would
like
you
to
show
them
their
rooms
maggie
david
fine
would
we
like
to
see
all
the
house
as
well
as
the
sleeping
accommodation
but
first
he
gives
his
father
the
look
with
which
chairmen
call
on
the
next
speaker
alick
i
take
you
david
he
produces
a
paper
parcel
from
a
roomy
pocket
it
wasn
t
likely
shand
that
we
should
forget
the
day
john
the
day
david
the
second
anniversary
of
your
marriage
we
came
purposely
for
the
day
james
his
fingers
itching
to
take
the
parcel
from
his
father
it
s
a
lace
shawl
maggie
from
the
three
of
us
a
pure
tobermory
you
would
never
dare
wear
it
if
you
knew
the
cost
the
shawl
in
its
beauty
is
revealed
and
maggie
hails
it
with
little
cries
of
joy
she
rushes
at
the
donors
and
kisses
each
of
them
just
as
if
she
were
a
pretty
woman
they
are
much
pleased
and
give
expression
to
their
pleasure
in
a
not
very
dissimilar
manner
alick
havers
david
havers
james
havers
john
it
s
a
very
fine
shawl
he
should
not
have
spoken
for
he
has
set
james
s
volatile
mind
working
james
you
may
say
so
what
did
you
give
her
shand
john
suddenly
deserted
by
god
and
man
me
alick
yes
yes
let
s
see
it
john
oh
i
he
is
not
deserted
by
maggie
but
she
can
think
of
no
way
out
sybil
prompted
by
the
impediment
which
is
in
hiding
quite
close
did
he
forget
there
is
more
than
a
touch
of
malice
in
the
question
it
is
a
challenge
and
the
wylies
as
a
family
are
almost
too
quick
to
accept
a
challenge
maggie
lifting
the
gage
of
battle
john
forget
never
it
s
a
pendant
father
the
impediment
bolts
john
rises
alick
a
pendant
one
of
those
things
on
a
chain
he
grins
remembering
how
once
about
sixty
years
ago
he
and
a
lady
and
a
pendant
but
we
have
no
time
for
this
maggie
yes
david
who
has
felt
the
note
of
antagonism
and
is
troubled
you
were
slow
in
speaking
of
it
shand
maggie
this
is
her
fight
he
was
shy
because
he
thought
you
might
blame
him
for
extravagance
david
relieved
oh
that
s
it
james
licking
his
lips
let
s
see
it
maggie
a
daughter
of
the
devil
where
did
you
put
it
john
john
s
mouth
opens
but
has
nothing
to
contribute
sybil
the
impediment
has
stolen
back
again
perhaps
it
has
been
mislaid
the
brothers
echo
the
word
incredulously
maggie
not
it
i
can
t
think
where
we
laid
it
down
john
it
s
not
on
that
table
is
it
james
the
wylies
turn
to
look
and
maggie
s
hand
goes
out
to
lady
sybil
john
shand
witness
it
is
a
very
determined
hand
and
presently
a
pendant
is
placed
in
it
here
it
is
alick
and
the
brothers
cluster
round
it
weigh
it
and
appraise
it
alick
preserve
me
is
that
stone
real
shand
john
who
has
begun
to
look
his
grimmest
yes
maggie
who
is
now
ready
if
he
wishes
it
to
take
him
on
too
john
says
it
s
a
drop
of
his
blood
john
wishing
it
and
so
it
is
david
well
said
shand
maggie
scared
and
now
if
you
ll
come
with
me
i
think
john
has
something
he
wants
to
talk
over
with
lady
sybil
recovering
and
taking
him
on
or
would
you
prefer
john
to
say
it
before
us
all
sybil
gasping
no
john
flinging
back
his
head
yes
i
prefer
to
say
it
before
you
all
maggie
flinging
back
hers
then
sit
down
again
the
wylies
wonderingly
obey
sybil
shand
mr
shand
john
maggie
knows
and
it
was
only
for
her
i
was
troubled
do
you
think
i
m
afraid
of
them
with
mighty
relief
now
we
can
be
open
david
lowering
what
is
it
what
s
wrong
john
shand
john
facing
him
squarely
it
was
to
lady
sybil
i
gave
the
pendant
and
all
my
love
with
it
perhaps
james
utters
a
cry
but
the
silence
of
alick
and
david
is
more
terrible
sybil
whose
voice
is
smaller
than
we
had
thought
what
are
you
to
do
it
is
to
maggie
she
is
speaking
david
she
ll
leave
it
for
us
to
do
john
that
s
what
i
want
the
lords
of
creation
look
at
the
ladies
maggie
interpreting
you
and
i
are
expected
to
retire
lady
sybil
while
the
men
decide
our
fate
sybil
is
ready
to
obey
the
law
but
maggie
remains
seated
man
s
the
oak
woman
s
the
ivy
which
of
us
is
it
that
s
to
cling
to
you
john
with
three
stalwarts
glaring
at
him
john
rather
grandly
takes
sybil
s
hand
they
are
two
against
the
world
sybil
a
heroine
i
hesitated
but
i
am
afraid
no
longer
whatever
he
asks
of
me
i
will
do
evidently
the
first
thing
he
asks
of
her
is
to
await
him
in
the
it
will
mean
surrendering
everything
for
him
i
am
glad
it
means
all
that
she
passes
into
the
looking
as
pretty
as
a
kiss
maggie
so
that
settles
it
alick
i
m
thinking
that
doesn
t
settle
it
david
no
by
god
but
his
love
for
maggie
steadies
him
there
is
even
a
note
of
entreaty
in
his
voice
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
her
man
john
i
have
things
to
say
to
her
but
not
before
you
david
sternly
go
away
maggie
leave
him
to
us
james
who
thinks
it
is
about
time
that
he
said
something
yes
leave
him
to
us
maggie
no
david
i
want
to
hear
what
is
to
become
of
me
i
promise
not
to
take
any
side
and
sitting
by
the
fire
she
resumes
her
knitting
the
four
regard
her
as
on
an
evening
at
the
pans
a
good
many
years
ago
david
barking
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
john
if
you
mean
how
long
has
that
lady
been
the
apple
of
my
eye
i
m
not
sure
but
i
never
told
her
of
it
until
today
maggie
thoughtfully
and
without
dropping
a
stitch
i
think
it
wasn
t
till
about
six
months
ago
john
that
she
began
to
be
very
dear
to
you
at
first
you
liked
to
bring
in
her
name
when
talking
to
me
so
that
i
could
tell
you
of
any
little
things
i
might
have
heard
she
was
doing
but
afterwards
as
she
became
more
and
more
to
you
you
avoided
mentioning
her
name
john
surprised
did
you
notice
that
maggie
in
her
way
yes
john
i
tried
to
be
done
with
it
for
your
sake
i
ve
often
had
a
sore
heart
for
you
maggie
james
you
re
proving
it
maggie
yes
james
he
had
i
ve
often
seen
him
looking
at
me
very
sorrowfully
of
late
because
of
what
was
in
his
mind
and
many
a
kindly
little
thing
he
has
done
for
me
that
he
didn
t
use
to
do
john
you
noticed
that
too
maggie
yes
david
controlling
himself
well
we
won
t
go
into
that
the
thing
to
be
thankful
for
is
that
it
s
ended
alick
who
is
looking
very
old
yes
yes
that
s
the
great
thing
john
all
useless
sir
it
s
not
ended
it
s
to
go
on
david
there
s
a
devil
in
you
john
shand
john
who
is
an
unhappy
man
just
now
i
dare
say
there
is
but
do
you
think
he
had
a
walk
over
david
james
man
i
could
knock
you
down
maggie
there
s
not
one
of
you
could
knock
john
down
david
exasperated
quiet
maggie
one
would
think
you
were
taking
his
part
maggie
do
you
expect
me
to
desert
him
at
the
very
moment
that
he
needs
me
most
david
it
s
him
that
s
deserting
you
john
yes
maggie
that
s
what
it
is
alick
where
s
your
marriage
vow
and
your
church
attendances
james
with
terrible
irony
and
your
prize
for
moral
philosophy
john
recklessly
all
gone
whistling
down
the
wind
david
i
suppose
you
understand
that
you
ll
have
to
resign
your
seat
john
his
underlip
much
in
evidence
there
are
hundreds
of
seats
but
there
s
only
one
john
shand
maggie
but
we
don
t
hear
her
that
s
how
i
like
to
hear
him
speak
david
the
ablest
person
in
the
room
think
man
i
m
old
by
you
and
for
long
i
ve
had
a
pride
in
you
it
will
be
beginning
the
world
again
with
more
against
you
than
there
was
eight
years
ago
john
i
have
a
better
head
to
begin
it
with
than
i
had
eight
years
ago
alick
hoping
this
will
bite
she
ll
have
her
own
money
david
john
she
s
as
poor
as
a
mouse
james
thinking
possibly
of
his
elizabeth
s
mother
we
ll
go
to
her
friends
and
tell
them
all
they
ll
stop
it
john
she
s
of
age
james
they
ll
take
her
far
away
john
i
ll
follow
and
tear
her
from
them
alick
your
career
john
to
his
credit
to
hell
with
my
career
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
i
m
on
the
rocks
what
can
you
or
you
or
you
understand
of
the
passions
of
a
man
i
ve
fought
and
i
ve
given
in
when
a
ship
founders
as
i
suppose
i
m
foundering
it
s
not
a
thing
to
yelp
at
peace
all
of
you
he
strides
into
the
where
we
see
him
at
times
pacing
the
floor
david
to
james
who
gives
signs
of
a
desire
to
take
off
his
coat
let
him
be
we
can
t
budge
him
with
bitter
wisdom
it
s
true
what
he
says
true
at
any
rate
about
me
what
do
i
know
of
the
passions
of
a
man
i
m
up
against
something
i
don
t
understand
alick
it
s
something
wicked
david
i
dare
say
it
is
but
it
s
something
big
james
it
s
that
damned
charm
maggie
still
by
the
fire
that
s
it
what
was
it
that
made
you
fancy
elizabeth
james
james
sheepishly
i
can
scarcely
say
maggie
it
was
her
charm
david
her
charm
james
pugnaciously
yes
her
charm
maggie
she
had
charm
for
james
this
somehow
breaks
them
up
maggie
goes
from
one
to
another
with
an
odd
little
smile
flickering
on
her
face
david
put
on
your
things
maggie
and
we
ll
leave
his
house
maggie
patting
his
kind
head
not
me
david
this
is
a
maggie
they
have
known
but
forgotten
all
three
brighten
david
you
haven
t
given
in
the
smile
flickers
and
expires
maggie
i
want
you
all
to
go
upstairs
and
let
me
have
my
try
now
james
your
try
alick
maggie
you
put
new
life
into
me
james
and
into
me
david
says
nothing
the
way
he
grips
her
shoulder
says
it
for
him
maggie
i
ll
save
him
david
if
i
can
david
does
he
deserve
to
be
saved
after
the
way
he
has
treated
you
maggie
you
stupid
david
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
when
they
have
gone
john
comes
to
the
door
of
the
there
is
welling
up
in
him
a
great
pity
for
maggie
but
it
has
to
subside
a
little
when
he
sees
that
the
knitting
is
still
in
her
hand
no
man
likes
to
be
so
soon
supplanted
sybil
follows
and
the
two
of
them
gaze
at
the
active
needles
maggie
perceiving
that
she
has
visitors
come
in
john
sit
down
lady
sybil
and
make
yourself
comfortable
i
m
afraid
we
ve
put
you
about
she
is
after
all
only
a
few
years
older
than
they
and
scarcely
looks
her
age
yet
it
must
have
been
in
some
such
way
as
this
that
the
little
old
woman
who
lived
in
a
shoe
addressed
her
numerous
progeny
john
i
m
mortal
sorry
maggie
sybil
who
would
be
more
courageous
if
she
could
hold
his
hand
and
i
also
maggie
soothingly
i
m
sure
you
are
but
as
it
can
t
be
helped
i
see
no
reason
why
we
three
shouldn
t
talk
the
matter
over
in
a
practical
way
sybil
looks
doubtful
but
john
hangs
on
desperately
to
the
word
practical
john
if
you
could
understand
maggie
what
an
inspiration
she
is
to
me
and
my
work
sybil
indeed
shand
i
think
of
nothing
else
maggie
that
s
fine
that
s
as
it
should
be
sybil
talking
too
much
shand
i
think
you
are
very
kind
to
take
it
so
reasonably
maggie
that
s
the
scotch
way
when
were
you
thinking
of
leaving
me
john
perhaps
this
is
the
scotch
way
also
but
sybil
is
english
and
from
the
manner
in
which
she
starts
you
would
say
that
something
has
fallen
on
her
toes
john
who
has
heard
nothing
fall
i
think
now
that
it
has
come
to
a
breach
the
sooner
the
better
his
tone
becomes
that
of
james
when
asked
after
the
health
of
his
wife
when
it
is
convenient
to
you
maggie
maggie
making
a
rapid
calculation
it
couldn
t
well
be
before
wednesday
that
s
the
day
the
laundry
comes
home
sybil
has
to
draw
in
her
toes
again
john
and
it
s
the
day
the
house
rises
stifling
a
groan
it
may
be
my
last
appearance
in
the
house
sybil
her
arms
yearning
for
him
no
no
please
don
t
say
that
maggie
surveying
him
sympathetically
you
love
the
house
don
t
you
john
next
to
her
it
s
a
pity
you
can
t
wait
till
after
your
speech
at
leeds
venables
won
t
let
you
speak
at
leeds
i
fear
if
you
leave
me
john
what
a
chance
it
would
have
been
but
let
it
go
maggie
the
meeting
is
in
less
than
a
month
could
you
not
make
it
such
a
speech
that
they
would
be
very
loth
to
lose
you
john
swelling
that
s
what
was
in
my
mind
sybil
with
noble
confidence
and
he
could
have
done
it
maggie
then
we
ve
come
to
something
practical
john
exercising
his
imagination
with
powerful
effect
no
it
wouldn
t
be
fair
to
you
if
i
was
to
stay
on
now
maggie
do
you
think
i
ll
let
myself
be
considered
when
your
career
is
at
stake
a
month
will
soon
pass
for
me
i
ll
have
a
lot
of
packing
to
do
john
it
s
noble
of
you
but
i
don
t
deserve
it
and
i
can
t
take
it
from
you
maggie
now
s
the
time
lady
sybil
for
you
to
have
one
of
your
inspiring
ideas
sybil
ever
ready
yes
yes
but
what
it
is
odd
that
they
should
both
turn
to
maggie
at
this
moment
maggie
who
has
already
been
saying
it
to
herself
what
do
you
think
of
this
i
can
stay
on
here
with
my
father
and
brothers
and
you
john
can
go
away
somewhere
and
devote
yourself
to
your
speech
sybil
yes
john
that
might
be
considerately
away
from
both
of
you
where
could
i
go
sybil
ever
ready
where
maggie
i
know
she
has
called
up
a
number
on
the
telephone
before
they
have
time
to
check
her
john
on
his
dignity
don
t
be
in
such
a
hurry
maggie
maggie
is
this
lamb
s
hotel
put
me
on
to
the
comtesse
de
la
briere
please
sybil
with
a
sinking
what
do
you
want
with
auntie
maggie
her
cottage
in
the
country
would
be
the
very
place
she
invited
john
and
me
john
yes
but
maggie
arguing
and
venables
is
to
be
there
think
of
the
impression
you
could
make
on
him
seeing
him
daily
for
three
weeks
john
there
s
something
in
that
maggie
is
it
you
comtesse
i
m
maggie
shand
sybil
you
are
not
to
tell
her
that
maggie
no
to
the
comtesse
oh
i
m
very
well
never
was
better
yes
yes
you
see
i
can
t
because
my
folk
have
never
been
in
london
before
and
i
must
take
them
about
and
show
them
the
sights
but
john
could
come
to
you
alone
why
not
john
with
proper
pride
if
she
s
not
keen
to
have
me
i
won
t
go
maggie
she
s
very
keen
comtesse
i
could
come
for
a
day
by
and
by
to
see
how
you
are
getting
on
yes
yes
certainly
to
john
she
says
she
ll
be
delighted
john
thoughtfully
you
re
not
doing
this
maggie
thinking
that
my
being
absent
from
sybil
for
a
few
weeks
can
make
any
difference
of
course
it
s
natural
you
should
want
us
to
keep
apart
but
maggie
grimly
i
m
founding
no
hope
on
keeping
you
apart
john
john
it
s
what
other
wives
would
do
maggie
i
promised
to
be
different
john
his
position
as
a
strong
man
assured
then
tell
her
i
accept
he
wanders
back
into
the
sybil
i
think
she
is
not
sure
what
she
thinks
i
think
you
are
very
wonderful
maggie
was
that
john
calling
to
you
sybil
was
it
she
is
glad
to
join
him
in
the
maggie
comtesse
hold
the
line
a
minute
she
is
alone
and
she
has
nearly
reached
the
end
of
her
she
shakes
emotionally
and
utters
painful
little
cries
there
is
something
she
wants
to
do
and
she
is
loth
to
do
it
but
she
does
it
are
you
there
comtesse
there
s
one
other
thing
dear
comtesse
i
want
you
to
invite
lady
sybil
also
yes
for
the
whole
time
that
john
is
there
no
i
m
not
mad
as
a
great
favour
to
me
yes
i
have
a
very
particular
reason
but
i
won
t
tell
you
what
it
is
oh
call
me
scotchy
as
much
as
you
like
but
consent
do
do
do
thank
you
thank
you
she
has
control
of
herself
now
and
is
determined
not
to
let
it
slip
from
her
again
when
they
reappear
the
stubborn
one
is
writing
a
letter
john
i
thought
i
heard
the
telephone
again
maggie
looking
up
from
her
labours
it
was
the
comtesse
she
says
she
s
to
invite
lady
sybil
to
the
cottage
at
the
same
time
sybil
me
john
to
invite
sybil
then
of
course
i
won
t
go
maggie
maggie
wondering
seemingly
at
these
niceties
what
does
it
matter
is
anything
to
be
considered
except
the
speech
it
has
been
admitted
that
she
was
a
little
devil
and
with
sybil
on
the
spot
john
to
help
you
and
inspire
you
what
a
speech
it
will
be
john
carried
away
maggie
you
really
are
a
very
generous
woman
sybil
convinced
at
last
she
is
indeed
john
and
you
re
queer
too
how
many
women
in
the
circumstances
would
sit
down
to
write
a
letter
maggie
it
s
a
letter
to
you
john
john
to
me
maggie
i
ll
give
it
to
you
when
it
s
finished
but
i
ask
you
not
to
open
it
till
your
visit
to
the
comtesse
ends
john
what
is
it
about
maggie
it
s
practical
sybil
rather
faintly
practical
she
has
heard
the
word
so
frequently
that
it
is
beginning
to
have
a
scotch
sound
she
feels
she
ought
to
like
maggie
but
that
she
would
like
her
better
if
they
were
farther
apart
she
indicates
that
the
doctors
are
troubled
about
her
heart
and
murmuring
her
adieux
she
goes
john
who
is
accompanying
her
pauses
at
the
door
john
with
a
queer
sort
of
admiration
for
his
wife
maggie
i
wish
i
was
fond
of
you
maggie
heartily
i
wish
you
were
john
he
goes
and
she
resumes
her
letter
the
stocking
is
lying
at
hand
and
she
pushes
it
to
the
floor
she
is
done
for
a
time
with
knitting
act
iv
man
s
most
pleasant
invention
is
the
all
the
birds
know
this
and
that
is
why
when
it
is
at
rest
there
is
always
at
least
one
of
them
sitting
on
the
handle
with
his
head
cocked
wondering
how
the
delicious
whirring
sound
is
made
when
they
find
out
they
will
change
their
note
as
it
is
you
must
sometimes
have
thought
that
you
heard
the
mower
very
early
in
the
morning
and
perhaps
you
peeped
in
neglige
from
your
lattice
window
to
see
who
was
up
so
early
it
was
really
the
birds
trying
to
get
the
note
on
this
broiling
morning
however
we
are
at
noon
and
whoever
looks
will
see
that
the
whirring
is
done
by
venables
he
is
in
a
linen
suit
with
the
coat
discarded
the
bird
is
sitting
on
it
and
he
comes
and
goes
across
the
comtesse
s
lawns
pleasantly
mopping
his
face
we
see
him
through
a
crooked
bowed
window
generously
open
roses
intruding
into
it
as
if
to
prevent
its
ever
being
closed
at
night
there
are
other
roses
in
such
armfuls
on
the
tables
that
one
could
not
easily
say
where
the
room
ends
and
the
garden
begins
in
the
comtesse
s
pretty
comic
for
she
likes
the
comic
touch
when
she
is
in
england
sits
john
shand
with
his
hostess
on
chairs
at
a
great
distance
from
each
other
no
linen
garments
for
john
nor
flannels
nor
even
knickerbockers
he
envies
the
english
way
of
dressing
for
trees
and
lawns
but
is
too
scotch
to
be
able
to
imitate
it
he
wears
tweeds
just
as
he
would
do
in
his
native
country
where
they
would
be
in
kilts
like
many
another
scot
the
first
time
he
ever
saw
a
kilt
was
on
a
sassenach
indeed
kilts
were
perhaps
invented
like
golf
to
draw
the
english
north
john
is
doing
nothing
which
again
is
not
a
scotch
accomplishment
and
he
looks
rather
miserable
and
dour
the
comtesse
is
already
at
her
patience
cards
and
occasionally
she
smiles
on
him
as
if
not
displeased
with
his
long
silence
at
last
she
speaks
comtesse
i
feel
it
rather
a
shame
to
detain
you
here
on
such
a
lovely
day
shand
entertaining
an
old
woman
john
i
don
t
pretend
to
think
i
m
entertaining
you
comtesse
comtesse
but
you
are
you
know
john
i
would
be
pleased
to
be
told
how
she
shrugs
her
impertinent
shoulders
and
presently
there
is
another
heavy
sigh
from
john
comtesse
again
why
do
not
you
go
out
on
the
river
john
yes
i
can
do
that
he
rises
comtesse
and
take
sybil
with
you
he
sits
again
no
john
i
have
been
on
the
river
with
her
twenty
times
comtesse
then
take
her
for
a
long
walk
through
the
fairloe
woods
john
we
were
there
twice
last
week
comtesse
there
is
a
romantically
damp
little
arbour
at
the
end
of
what
the
villagers
call
the
lovers
lane
john
one
can
t
go
there
every
day
i
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
comtesse
did
i
laugh
i
must
have
been
translating
the
situation
into
french
perhaps
the
music
of
the
is
not
to
john
s
mood
for
he
betakes
himself
to
another
room
venables
pauses
in
his
labours
to
greet
a
lady
who
has
appeared
on
the
lawn
and
who
is
maggie
she
is
as
neat
as
if
she
were
one
of
the
army
of
typists
who
are
quite
the
nicest
kind
of
women
and
carries
a
little
bag
she
comes
in
through
the
window
and
puts
her
hands
over
the
comtesse
s
eyes
comtesse
they
are
a
strong
pair
of
hands
at
any
rate
maggie
and
not
very
white
and
biggish
for
my
size
now
guess
the
comtesse
guesses
and
takes
both
the
hands
in
hers
as
if
she
valued
them
she
pulls
off
maggie
s
hat
as
if
to
prevent
her
flying
away
comtesse
dear
abominable
one
not
to
let
me
know
you
were
coming
maggie
it
is
just
a
surprise
visit
comtesse
i
walked
up
from
the
station
for
a
moment
maggie
seems
to
have
borrowed
sybil
s
impediment
how
is
everybody
comtesse
he
is
quite
well
but
my
child
he
seems
to
me
to
be
a
most
unhappy
man
this
sad
news
does
not
seem
to
make
a
most
unhappy
woman
of
the
child
the
comtesse
is
puzzled
as
she
knows
nothing
of
the
situation
save
what
she
has
discovered
for
herself
why
should
that
please
you
o
heartless
one
maggie
i
won
t
tell
you
comtesse
i
could
take
you
and
shake
you
maggie
here
have
i
put
my
house
at
your
disposal
for
so
many
days
for
some
sly
scotch
purpose
and
you
will
not
tell
me
what
it
is
maggie
no
comtesse
very
well
then
but
i
have
what
you
call
a
nasty
one
for
you
the
comtesse
lures
venables
into
the
room
by
holding
up
what
might
be
a
foaming
glass
of
lemon
squash
alas
charles
it
is
but
a
flower
vase
i
want
you
to
tell
shand
what
you
think
of
her
husband
s
speech
venables
gives
his
hostess
a
reproachful
look
venables
eh
ah
shand
will
prefer
to
do
that
himself
i
promised
the
gardener
i
must
not
disappoint
him
excuse
me
comtesse
you
must
tell
her
charles
maggie
please
venables
i
should
like
to
know
he
sits
down
with
a
sigh
and
obeys
venables
your
husband
has
been
writing
the
speech
here
and
by
his
own
wish
he
read
it
to
me
three
days
ago
the
occasion
is
to
be
an
important
one
and
well
there
are
a
dozen
young
men
in
the
party
at
present
all
capable
of
filling
a
certain
small
ministerial
post
he
looks
longingly
at
the
mower
but
it
sends
no
message
to
his
aid
and
as
he
is
one
of
them
i
was
anxious
that
he
should
show
in
this
speech
of
what
he
is
capable
maggie
and
hasn
t
he
not
for
the
first
time
venables
wishes
that
he
was
not
in
politics
venables
i
am
afraid
he
has
comtesse
what
is
wrong
with
the
speech
charles
venables
nothing
and
he
can
still
deliver
it
it
is
a
powerful
piece
of
work
such
as
only
a
very
able
man
could
produce
but
it
has
no
special
quality
of
its
own
none
of
the
little
touches
that
used
to
make
an
old
stager
like
myself
want
to
pat
shand
on
the
shoulder
the
comtesse
s
mouth
twitches
but
maggie
declines
to
notice
it
he
pounds
on
manfully
enough
but
if
i
may
say
so
with
a
wooden
leg
it
is
as
good
i
dare
say
as
the
rest
of
them
could
have
done
but
they
start
with
such
inherited
advantages
shand
that
he
had
to
do
better
maggie
yes
i
can
understand
that
venables
i
am
sorry
shand
for
he
interested
me
his
career
has
set
me
wondering
whether
if
had
begun
as
a
railway
porter
i
might
not
still
be
calling
out
by
your
maggie
thinks
it
probable
but
not
important
maggie
venables
now
that
i
think
of
it
surely
john
wrote
to
me
that
you
were
dissatisfied
with
his
first
speech
and
that
he
was
writing
another
the
comtesse
s
eyes
open
very
wide
indeed
venables
i
have
heard
nothing
of
that
shand
he
shakes
his
wise
head
and
in
any
case
i
am
afraid
he
still
hears
the
wooden
leg
maggie
but
you
said
yourself
that
his
second
thoughts
were
sometimes
such
an
improvement
on
the
first
the
comtesse
comes
to
the
help
of
the
baggage
comtesse
i
remember
you
saying
that
charles
venables
yes
that
has
struck
me
politely
well
if
he
has
anything
to
show
me
in
the
meantime
he
regains
the
lawn
like
one
glad
to
escape
attendance
at
john
s
obsequies
the
comtesse
is
brought
back
to
speech
by
the
sound
of
the
mower
nothing
wooden
in
it
comtesse
what
are
you
up
to
now
miss
pin
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
there
is
no
such
speech
maggie
s
mouth
tightens
maggie
i
do
not
comtesse
it
is
a
duel
is
it
my
friend
the
comtesse
rings
the
bell
and
maggie
s
guilty
mind
is
agitated
maggie
what
are
you
ringing
for
comtesse
as
the
challenged
one
miss
pin
i
have
the
choice
of
weapons
i
am
going
to
send
for
your
husband
to
ask
him
if
he
has
written
such
a
speech
after
which
i
suppose
you
will
ask
me
to
leave
you
while
you
and
he
write
it
together
maggie
wrings
her
hands
maggie
you
are
wrong
comtesse
but
please
don
t
do
that
comtesse
you
but
make
me
more
curious
and
my
doctor
says
that
i
must
be
told
everything
the
comtesse
assumes
the
pose
of
her
sex
in
melodrama
put
your
cards
on
the
table
maggie
shand
or
she
indicates
that
she
always
pinks
her
man
maggie
dolefully
produces
a
roll
of
paper
from
her
bag
what
precisely
is
that
the
reply
is
little
more
than
a
squeak
maggie
john
s
speech
comtesse
you
have
written
it
yourself
maggie
is
naturally
indignant
maggie
it
s
typed
comtesse
you
guessed
that
the
speech
he
wrote
unaided
would
not
satisfy
and
you
prepared
this
to
take
its
place
maggie
not
at
all
comtesse
it
is
the
draft
of
his
speech
that
he
left
at
home
that
s
all
comtesse
with
a
few
trivial
alterations
by
yourself
i
swear
can
you
deny
it
no
wonder
that
maggie
is
outraged
she
replaces
john
s
speech
in
the
bag
with
becoming
hauteur
maggie
comtesse
these
insinuations
are
unworthy
of
you
may
i
ask
where
is
my
husband
the
comtesse
drops
her
a
curtsey
comtesse
i
believe
your
haughtiness
may
find
him
in
the
dutch
garden
oh
i
see
through
you
you
are
not
to
show
him
your
speech
but
you
are
to
get
him
to
write
another
one
and
somehow
all
your
additions
will
be
in
it
think
not
creature
that
you
can
deceive
one
so
old
in
iniquity
as
the
comtesse
de
la
briere
there
can
be
but
one
reply
from
a
good
wife
to
such
a
charge
and
at
once
the
comtesse
is
left
alone
with
her
shame
anon
a
footman
appears
you
know
how
they
come
and
go
footman
you
rang
my
lady
comtesse
did
i
ah
yes
but
why
he
is
but
lately
from
the
ploughshare
and
can
not
help
her
in
this
quandary
her
eyes
alight
upon
the
bag
she
is
unfortunately
too
abandoned
to
feel
her
shame
she
still
thinks
that
she
has
the
choice
of
weapons
she
takes
the
speech
from
the
bag
and
bestows
it
on
her
servitor
take
this
to
venables
please
and
say
it
is
from
shand
thomas
but
in
the
end
we
shall
probably
call
him
john
departs
with
the
dangerous
papers
and
when
maggie
returns
she
finds
that
the
comtesse
is
once
more
engaged
in
her
interrupted
game
of
patience
you
did
not
find
him
all
the
bravery
has
dropped
from
maggie
s
face
maggie
i
didn
t
see
him
but
i
heard
him
she
is
with
him
i
think
they
are
coming
here
the
comtesse
is
suddenly
kind
again
comtesse
sybil
shall
i
get
rid
of
her
maggie
no
i
want
her
to
be
here
too
now
i
shall
know
the
comtesse
twists
the
little
thing
round
comtesse
know
what
maggie
as
soon
as
i
look
into
his
face
i
shall
know
a
delicious
scent
ushers
in
the
fair
sybil
who
is
as
sweet
as
a
milking
stool
she
greets
shand
with
some
alarm
maggie
how
do
you
do
lady
sybil
how
pretty
you
look
in
that
frock
sybil
rustles
uncomfortably
you
are
a
feast
to
the
eye
sybil
please
i
wish
you
would
not
shall
we
describe
sybil
s
frock
in
which
she
looks
like
a
great
strawberry
that
knows
it
ought
to
be
plucked
or
would
it
be
easier
to
watch
the
coming
of
john
let
us
watch
john
john
you
maggie
you
never
wrote
that
you
were
coming
no
let
us
watch
maggie
as
soon
as
she
looked
into
his
face
she
was
to
know
something
of
importance
maggie
not
dissatisfied
with
what
she
sees
no
john
it
s
a
surprise
visit
i
just
ran
down
to
say
at
this
his
face
falls
which
does
not
seem
to
pain
her
sybil
foreseeing
another
horrible
scotch
scene
to
say
comtesse
thrilling
with
expectation
to
whom
maggie
sybil
deserted
by
the
impediment
which
is
probably
playing
with
rough
boys
in
the
lovers
lane
auntie
do
leave
us
won
t
you
comtesse
not
i
it
is
becoming
far
too
interesting
maggie
i
suppose
there
s
no
reason
the
comtesse
shouldn
t
be
told
as
she
will
know
so
soon
at
any
rate
john
that
s
so
sybil
sees
with
discomfort
that
he
is
to
be
practical
also
maggie
it
s
so
simple
you
see
comtesse
john
and
lady
sybil
have
fallen
in
love
with
one
another
and
they
are
to
go
off
as
soon
as
the
meeting
at
leeds
has
taken
place
the
comtesse
s
breast
is
too
suddenly
introduced
to
caledonia
and
its
varied
charms
comtesse
mon
dieu
maggie
i
think
that
s
putting
it
correctly
john
john
in
a
sense
but
i
m
not
to
attend
the
meeting
at
leeds
my
speech
doesn
t
find
favour
with
a
strange
humility
there
s
something
wrong
with
it
comtesse
i
never
expected
to
hear
you
say
that
shand
john
wondering
also
i
never
expected
it
myself
i
meant
to
make
it
the
speech
of
my
career
but
somehow
my
hand
seems
to
have
lost
its
cunning
comtesse
and
you
don
t
know
how
john
it
s
inexplicable
my
brain
was
never
clearer
comtesse
you
might
have
helped
him
sybil
sybil
quite
sulkily
i
did
comtesse
but
i
thought
she
was
such
an
inspiration
to
you
shand
john
going
bravely
to
sybil
s
side
she
slaved
at
it
with
me
comtesse
strange
wickedly
becoming
practical
also
so
now
there
is
nothing
to
detain
you
shall
i
send
for
a
fly
sybil
sybil
with
a
cry
of
the
heart
auntie
do
leave
us
comtesse
i
can
understand
your
impatience
to
be
gone
shand
john
heavily
i
promised
maggie
to
wait
till
the
and
i
m
a
man
of
my
word
maggie
but
i
give
you
back
your
word
john
you
can
go
now
john
looks
at
sybil
and
sybil
looks
at
john
and
the
impediment
arrives
in
time
to
take
a
peep
at
both
of
them
sybil
groping
for
the
practical
to
which
we
must
all
come
in
the
end
he
must
make
satisfactory
arrangements
about
you
first
i
insist
on
that
maggie
with
no
more
imagination
than
a
hen
thank
you
lady
sybil
but
i
have
made
all
my
arrangements
john
stung
maggie
that
was
my
part
maggie
you
see
my
brothers
feel
they
can
t
be
away
from
their
business
any
longer
and
so
if
it
would
be
convenient
to
you
john
i
could
travel
north
with
them
by
the
night
train
on
wednesday
sybil
i
i
the
way
you
put
things
john
this
is
just
the
maggie
my
things
are
all
packed
i
think
you
ll
find
the
house
in
good
order
lady
sybil
i
have
had
the
vacuum
cleaners
in
i
ll
give
you
the
keys
of
the
linen
and
the
silver
plate
i
have
them
in
that
bag
the
carpet
on
the
upper
landing
is
a
good
deal
frayed
but
sybil
please
i
don
t
want
to
hear
any
more
maggie
the
ceiling
of
the
would
be
the
better
of
a
new
lick
of
paint
sybil
stamping
her
foot
small
fours
can
t
you
stop
her
john
soothingly
she
s
meaning
well
maggie
i
know
it
s
natural
to
you
to
value
those
things
because
your
outlook
on
life
is
bounded
by
them
but
all
this
jars
on
me
maggie
does
it
john
why
should
you
be
so
ready
to
go
maggie
i
promised
not
to
stand
in
your
way
john
stoutly
you
needn
t
be
in
such
a
hurry
there
are
three
days
to
run
yet
the
french
are
so
different
from
us
that
we
shall
probably
never
be
able
to
understand
why
the
comtesse
laughed
aloud
here
it
s
just
a
joke
to
the
comtesse
comtesse
it
seems
to
be
no
joke
to
you
shand
sybil
my
pet
are
you
to
let
him
off
sybil
flashing
let
him
off
if
he
wishes
it
do
you
john
manfully
i
want
it
to
go
on
something
seems
to
have
caught
in
his
throat
perhaps
it
is
the
impediment
trying
a
temporary
home
it
s
the
one
wish
of
my
heart
if
you
come
with
me
sybil
i
ll
do
all
in
a
man
s
power
to
make
you
never
regret
it
triumph
of
the
vere
de
veres
maggie
bringing
them
back
to
earth
with
a
dump
and
i
can
make
my
arrangements
for
wednesday
sybil
seeking
the
comtesse
s
protection
no
you
can
t
auntie
i
am
not
going
on
with
this
i
m
very
sorry
for
you
john
but
i
see
now
i
couldn
t
face
it
she
can
t
face
anything
at
this
moment
except
the
sofa
pillows
comtesse
noticing
john
s
big
sigh
of
relief
so
that
is
all
right
shand
maggie
don
t
you
love
her
any
more
john
be
practical
sybil
to
the
pillows
at
any
rate
i
have
tired
of
him
oh
best
to
tell
the
horrid
truth
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
i
have
been
crying
my
eyes
out
over
it
i
thought
i
was
such
a
different
kind
of
woman
but
i
am
weary
of
him
i
think
him
oh
so
dull
john
his
face
lighting
up
are
you
sure
that
is
how
you
have
come
to
think
of
me
sybil
i
m
sorry
with
all
her
soul
but
yes
yes
yes
john
by
god
it
s
more
than
i
deserve
comtesse
congratulations
to
you
both
sybil
runs
away
and
in
the
fulness
of
time
she
married
successfully
in
cloth
of
silver
which
was
afterwards
turned
into
a
maggie
you
haven
t
read
my
letter
yet
john
have
you
john
no
comtesse
imploringly
may
i
know
to
what
darling
letter
you
refer
maggie
it
s
a
letter
i
wrote
to
him
before
he
left
london
i
gave
it
to
him
closed
not
to
be
opened
until
his
time
here
was
ended
john
as
his
hand
strays
to
his
pocket
am
i
to
read
it
now
maggie
not
before
her
please
go
away
comtesse
comtesse
every
word
you
say
makes
me
more
determined
to
remain
maggie
it
will
hurt
you
john
distressed
don
t
read
it
tear
it
up
john
you
make
me
very
curious
maggie
and
yet
i
don
t
see
what
can
be
in
it
comtesse
but
you
feel
a
little
nervous
give
me
the
dagger
maggie
quickly
no
but
the
comtesse
has
already
got
it
comtesse
may
i
she
must
have
thought
they
said
yes
for
she
opens
the
letter
she
shares
its
contents
with
them
dearest
john
it
is
at
my
request
that
the
comtesse
is
having
lady
sybil
at
the
cottage
at
the
same
time
as
john
what
comtesse
yes
she
begged
me
to
invite
you
together
john
but
why
maggie
i
promised
you
not
to
behave
as
other
wives
would
do
john
it
s
not
understandable
comtesse
you
may
ask
why
i
do
this
john
and
my
reason
is
i
think
that
after
a
few
weeks
of
lady
sybil
every
day
and
all
day
you
will
become
sick
to
death
of
her
i
am
also
giving
her
the
chance
to
help
you
and
inspire
you
with
your
work
so
that
you
may
both
learn
what
her
help
and
her
inspiration
amount
to
of
course
if
your
love
is
the
great
strong
passion
you
think
it
then
those
weeks
will
make
you
love
her
more
than
ever
and
i
can
only
say
but
if
as
i
suspect
you
don
t
even
now
know
what
true
love
is
then
by
the
next
time
we
meet
dear
john
you
will
have
had
enough
of
your
affectionate
wife
oh
why
was
not
sybil
present
at
the
reading
of
the
will
and
now
if
you
two
will
kindly
excuse
me
i
think
i
must
go
and
get
that
poor
sufferer
the
eau
de
cologne
john
it
s
almost
enough
to
make
a
man
lose
faith
in
himself
comtesse
oh
don
t
say
that
shand
maggie
defending
him
you
mustn
t
hurt
him
if
you
haven
t
loved
deep
and
true
that
s
just
because
you
have
never
met
a
woman
yet
john
capable
of
inspiring
it
comtesse
putting
her
hand
on
maggie
s
shoulder
have
you
not
shand
john
i
see
what
you
mean
but
maggie
wouldn
t
think
better
of
me
for
any
false
pretences
she
knows
my
feelings
for
her
now
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
what
they
have
always
been
maggie
who
sees
that
he
is
looking
at
her
as
solemnly
as
a
volume
of
sermons
printed
by
request
i
think
no
one
could
be
fond
of
me
that
can
t
laugh
a
little
at
me
john
how
could
that
help
comtesse
exasperated
shand
i
give
you
up
maggie
i
admire
his
honesty
comtesse
oh
i
give
you
up
also
arcades
ambo
scotchies
both
john
when
she
has
gone
but
this
letter
it
s
not
like
you
by
gosh
maggie
you
re
no
fool
she
beams
at
this
as
any
wife
would
but
how
could
i
have
made
such
a
mistake
it
s
not
like
a
strong
man
evidently
he
has
an
inspiration
maggie
what
is
it
john
the
inspiration
am
i
a
strong
man
maggie
you
of
course
you
are
and
has
anybody
ever
helped
you
in
the
smallest
way
john
thinking
it
out
again
no
nobody
maggie
not
even
lady
sybil
john
i
m
beginning
to
doubt
it
it
s
very
curious
though
maggie
that
this
speech
should
be
disappointing
maggie
it
s
just
that
venables
hasn
t
the
brains
to
see
how
good
it
is
john
that
must
be
it
but
he
is
too
good
a
man
to
rest
satisfied
with
this
no
maggie
it
s
not
somehow
i
seem
to
have
lost
my
neat
way
of
saying
things
maggie
almost
cooing
it
will
come
back
to
you
john
forlorn
if
you
knew
how
i
ve
tried
maggie
cautiously
maybe
if
you
were
to
try
again
and
i
ll
just
come
and
sit
beside
you
and
knit
i
think
the
click
of
the
needles
sometimes
put
you
in
the
mood
john
hardly
that
and
yet
many
a
shandism
have
i
knocked
off
while
you
were
sitting
beside
me
knitting
i
suppose
it
was
the
quietness
maggie
very
likely
john
with
another
inspiration
maggie
maggie
again
what
is
it
john
john
what
if
it
was
you
that
put
those
queer
ideas
into
my
head
maggie
me
john
without
your
knowing
it
i
mean
maggie
but
how
john
we
used
to
talk
bits
over
and
it
may
be
that
you
dropped
the
seed
so
to
speak
maggie
john
could
it
be
this
that
i
sometimes
had
the
idea
in
a
rough
womanish
sort
of
way
and
then
you
polished
it
up
till
it
came
out
a
shandism
john
slowly
slapping
his
knee
i
believe
you
ve
hit
it
maggie
to
think
that
you
may
have
been
helping
me
all
the
time
and
neither
of
us
knew
it
he
has
so
nearly
reached
a
smile
that
no
one
can
say
what
might
have
happened
within
the
next
moment
if
the
comtesse
had
not
reappeared
comtesse
venables
wishes
to
see
you
shand
john
lost
stolen
or
strayed
a
smile
in
the
making
hum
comtesse
he
is
coming
now
john
grumpy
indeed
comtesse
sweetly
it
is
about
your
speech
john
he
has
said
all
he
need
say
on
that
subject
and
more
comtesse
quaking
a
little
i
think
it
is
about
the
second
speech
john
what
second
speech
maggie
runs
to
her
bag
and
opens
it
maggie
horrified
comtesse
you
have
given
it
to
him
comtesse
impudently
wasn
t
i
meant
to
john
what
is
it
what
second
speech
maggie
cruel
cruel
willing
to
go
on
her
knees
you
had
left
the
first
draft
of
your
speech
at
home
john
and
i
brought
it
here
with
with
a
few
little
things
i
ve
added
myself
john
a
what
s
that
maggie
four
foot
ten
at
most
just
trifles
things
i
was
to
suggest
to
you
while
i
was
knitting
and
then
if
you
liked
any
of
them
you
could
have
polished
them
and
turned
them
into
something
good
john
john
and
now
she
has
shown
it
to
venables
john
thundering
as
my
work
comtesse
but
the
comtesse
is
not
of
the
women
who
are
afraid
of
thunder
maggie
it
is
your
work
of
it
john
in
the
black
cap
you
presumed
maggie
shand
very
well
then
here
he
comes
and
now
we
ll
see
to
what
extent
you
ve
helped
me
venables
my
dear
fellow
my
dear
shand
i
congratulate
you
give
me
your
hand
john
the
speech
venables
you
have
improved
it
out
of
knowledge
it
is
the
same
speech
but
those
new
touches
make
all
the
difference
john
sits
down
heavily
shand
be
proud
of
him
maggie
i
am
i
am
john
comtesse
you
always
said
that
his
second
thoughts
were
best
charles
venables
pleased
to
be
reminded
of
it
didn
t
i
didn
t
i
those
delicious
little
touches
how
good
that
is
shand
about
the
flowing
tide
comtesse
the
flowing
tide
venables
in
the
first
speech
it
was
something
like
this
gentlemen
the
opposition
are
calling
to
you
to
vote
for
them
and
the
flowing
tide
but
i
solemnly
warn
you
to
beware
lest
the
flowing
tide
does
not
engulf
the
second
way
is
much
better
comtesse
what
is
the
second
way
shand
john
does
not
tell
her
venables
this
is
how
he
puts
it
now
john
can
not
help
raising
his
head
to
listen
gentlemen
the
opposition
are
calling
to
you
to
vote
for
them
and
the
flowing
tide
but
i
ask
you
cheerfully
to
vote
for
us
and
dam
the
flowing
venables
and
his
old
friend
the
comtesse
laugh
heartily
but
for
different
reasons
comtesse
it
is
better
shand
maggie
don
t
think
so
venables
yes
yes
it
s
so
virile
excuse
me
comtesse
i
m
off
to
read
the
whole
thing
again
for
the
first
time
he
notices
that
john
is
strangely
quiet
i
think
this
has
rather
bowled
you
over
shand
john
s
head
sinks
lower
well
well
good
news
doesn
t
kill
maggie
counsel
for
the
defence
surely
the
important
thing
about
the
speech
is
its
strength
and
knowledge
and
eloquence
the
things
that
were
in
the
first
speech
as
well
as
in
the
second
venables
that
of
course
is
largely
true
the
wit
would
not
be
enough
without
them
just
as
they
were
not
enough
without
the
wit
it
is
the
combination
that
is
irresistible
john
s
head
rises
a
little
shand
you
are
our
man
remember
that
it
is
emphatically
the
best
thing
you
have
ever
done
how
this
will
go
down
at
leeds
he
returns
gaily
to
his
hammock
but
lower
sinks
john
s
head
and
even
the
comtesse
has
the
grace
to
take
herself
off
maggie
s
arms
flutter
near
her
husband
not
daring
to
alight
maggie
you
heard
what
he
said
john
it
s
the
combination
is
it
so
terrible
to
you
to
find
that
my
love
for
you
had
made
me
able
to
help
you
in
the
little
things
john
the
little
things
it
seems
strange
to
me
to
hear
you
call
me
by
my
name
maggie
it
s
as
if
i
looked
on
you
for
the
first
time
maggie
look
at
me
john
for
the
first
time
what
do
you
see
john
i
see
a
woman
who
has
brought
her
husband
low
maggie
only
that
john
i
see
the
tragedy
of
a
man
who
has
found
himself
out
eh
i
can
t
live
with
you
again
maggie
he
shivers
maggie
why
did
you
shiver
john
john
it
was
at
myself
for
saying
that
i
couldn
t
live
with
you
again
when
i
should
have
been
wondering
how
for
so
long
you
have
lived
with
me
and
i
suppose
you
have
forgiven
me
all
the
time
she
nods
and
forgive
me
still
she
nods
again
dear
god
maggie
john
am
i
to
go
or
are
you
to
keep
me
on
she
is
now
a
little
bundle
near
his
feet
i
m
willing
to
stay
because
i
m
useful
to
you
if
it
can
t
be
for
a
better
reason
his
hand
feels
for
her
and
the
bundle
wriggles
nearer
it
s
nothing
unusual
i
ve
done
john
every
man
who
is
high
up
loves
to
think
that
he
has
done
it
all
himself
and
the
wife
smiles
and
lets
it
go
at
that
it
s
our
only
joke
every
woman
knows
that
he
stares
at
her
in
hopeless
perplexity
oh
john
if
only
you
could
laugh
at
me
john
i
can
t
laugh
maggie
but
as
he
continues
to
stare
at
her
a
strange
disorder
appears
in
his
face
maggie
feels
that
it
is
to
be
now
or
never
maggie
laugh
john
laugh
watch
me
see
how
easy
it
is
a
terrible
struggle
is
taking
place
within
him
he
creaks
something
that
may
be
mirth
forces
a
passage
at
first
painfully
no
more
joy
in
it
than
in
the
discoloured
water
from
a
spring
that
has
long
been
dry
soon
however
he
laughs
loud
and
long
the
spring
water
is
becoming
clear
maggie
claps
her
hands
he
is
saved
