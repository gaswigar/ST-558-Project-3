gratefully
affectionately
the
first
chapter
abner
fellows
was
born
in
the
front
bedroom
of
number
eleven
hackett
s
cottages
a
house
of
old
brickwork
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
row
of
set
diagonally
across
a
patch
of
waste
land
on
the
outskirts
of
halesby
the
terrace
was
fifty
years
old
and
looked
older
for
the
smoke
and
coal
dust
of
the
neighbouring
pits
had
corroded
the
surface
of
the
bricks
while
the
crowning
in
of
the
earth
s
crust
above
the
gigantic
burrowings
of
the
great
mawne
colliery
had
loosened
the
mortar
between
them
and
even
produced
a
series
of
long
cracks
that
clove
the
from
top
to
bottom
like
conventional
forked
lightning
one
of
these
lines
of
cleavage
split
the
face
of
number
eleven
and
ran
through
the
middle
of
a
plaster
plaque
on
which
the
pious
owner
of
the
cottages
had
carved
the
words
be
to
this
plaque
together
with
the
metal
medallion
of
a
fire
insurance
corporation
and
two
iron
bosses
connected
with
the
system
of
stays
by
which
mr
hackett
s
descendants
had
tried
to
save
their
property
from
collapsing
made
the
fellows
s
house
the
most
decorative
feature
of
the
row
and
gave
abner
a
feeling
of
enviable
distinction
in
his
childhood
long
before
he
knew
what
they
meant
his
father
john
fellows
like
the
rest
of
the
tenants
was
a
miner
he
had
chosen
to
live
in
hackett
s
cottages
because
they
lay
nearer
to
the
colliery
than
any
other
buildings
in
halesby
and
were
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
where
stood
his
favourite
the
lyttleton
arms
hackett
s
cottages
in
fact
hung
poised
as
it
were
between
two
magnetic
poles
the
pit
where
the
money
was
earned
and
the
pub
where
it
was
spent
to
remain
there
contented
would
have
implied
a
nice
equilibrium
had
it
not
been
that
eastward
of
the
and
the
lyttleton
arms
ran
the
stourton
road
with
houses
on
both
sides
of
it
and
amongst
them
the
lord
nelson
the
greyhound
and
the
royal
oak
next
to
the
royal
oak
came
the
entrance
of
the
mawne
united
football
ground
and
since
john
fellows
s
passion
for
football
was
only
exceeded
by
his
devotion
to
the
pull
of
the
colliery
was
hopelessly
overbalanced
by
these
delights
at
the
side
of
the
royal
oak
on
saturday
afternoons
the
entrance
to
the
football
ground
swarmed
with
black
coats
and
the
crowd
of
small
boys
of
whom
abner
made
one
peering
through
cracks
in
the
palings
could
see
nothing
but
the
backs
of
other
black
coats
or
perhaps
above
the
tilted
heads
of
the
spectators
the
sphere
of
a
football
leaping
gaily
into
the
dreary
gray
that
passes
for
heaven
in
a
winter
it
cost
threepence
ladies
and
children
to
enter
the
football
ground
and
since
john
fellows
never
wasted
the
price
of
a
pint
on
any
one
but
himself
abner
had
to
be
content
with
an
occasional
sight
of
the
football
soaring
above
this
or
that
quarter
of
the
field
of
play
and
with
the
hoarse
waves
of
encouragement
or
derision
that
went
up
from
the
crowd
inside
later
in
the
happy
days
before
his
father
s
second
marriage
and
the
second
family
john
fellows
used
to
take
the
boy
along
with
him
to
the
football
field
on
saturday
afternoons
or
rather
abner
would
trail
behind
him
as
far
as
the
gate
and
then
pass
through
the
turnstile
in
front
of
him
wedged
between
his
father
s
trousers
and
those
of
the
man
in
front
breathing
perpetually
the
acrid
smell
of
oily
which
he
accepted
as
the
natural
odour
of
humanity
whenever
he
could
get
himself
washed
in
time
john
fellows
made
a
point
of
going
early
to
the
ground
so
that
he
might
place
himself
in
his
favourite
position
immediately
behind
the
nearer
so
close
to
the
net
that
he
could
talk
with
george
harper
the
mawne
united
goalkeeper
who
before
this
translation
had
been
a
collier
working
in
the
same
shift
as
himself
or
the
of
the
visiting
custodian
with
jeers
and
abuse
even
at
these
close
quarters
where
abner
felt
the
pressure
of
his
father
s
protecting
legs
and
heard
him
spitting
into
the
net
over
his
head
there
was
no
conversation
between
them
john
fellows
kept
his
speech
for
his
mates
for
george
harper
or
on
occasion
for
the
referee
but
at
when
most
of
the
players
ran
in
to
the
pavilion
and
the
ball
was
free
he
would
give
abner
a
poke
in
the
back
and
his
neighbours
a
wink
and
the
lad
would
slip
under
the
wire
roping
and
plunge
into
the
of
boys
who
were
scrambling
for
its
possession
once
abner
had
dribbled
the
ball
away
from
the
others
and
sent
a
shot
at
the
goal
which
george
harper
who
had
stayed
behind
talking
moved
mechanically
to
stop
and
missed
a
ripple
of
laughter
had
spread
round
the
field
and
when
abner
ran
back
under
the
ropes
with
his
face
flaming
his
father
pulled
him
in
by
the
ear
and
said
with
his
clay
pipe
between
his
teeth
damn
little
yo
are
bain
t
he
george
and
george
harper
staring
down
at
him
with
his
big
melancholy
eyes
said
ah
next
day
as
a
reward
for
his
prowess
john
fellows
took
abner
with
him
on
his
afternoon
walk
past
the
cherry
orchard
past
the
stationary
cages
at
the
pithead
and
the
silent
of
the
great
mawne
colliery
down
between
the
smoking
to
the
bridge
over
the
stour
which
separates
the
two
counties
of
worcester
and
stafford
in
either
of
which
the
police
of
the
other
are
providentially
powerless
here
on
a
cinder
pathway
shaded
by
the
sooty
chestnuts
of
mawne
hall
there
was
racing
between
the
limber
whippets
that
the
miners
fancy
timid
quivering
creatures
with
their
slim
waists
bound
in
flannel
jackets
like
frail
women
in
their
stays
it
was
thrilling
to
watch
them
slip
from
the
leash
race
with
their
pointed
heads
converging
and
roll
over
at
the
finish
in
a
cloud
of
on
that
sunday
the
police
of
staffordshire
were
quiescent
george
harper
was
there
his
massive
thighs
bulging
striped
cashmere
trousers
there
was
joking
between
george
and
abner
s
father
about
the
goal
that
the
boy
had
kicked
john
fellows
won
five
shillings
on
a
dog
called
daisy
and
abner
trailed
home
behind
him
at
six
o
clock
when
the
steam
in
the
was
beginning
to
hiss
from
its
exhaust
in
preparation
for
monday
s
work
john
fellows
retired
to
the
lyttleton
arms
with
his
five
shillings
and
spent
a
dozen
more
while
abner
went
home
too
tired
to
play
and
clammed
for
his
tea
it
surprised
him
to
find
number
eleven
locked
up
though
he
ought
to
have
remembered
that
before
they
went
out
his
father
had
left
the
key
with
mrs
moseley
who
did
the
housework
and
cooked
their
dinner
but
when
he
walked
round
to
mrs
moseley
s
he
found
that
she
had
gone
to
church
and
forgotten
to
take
the
key
out
of
her
pocket
he
tramped
back
home
again
and
fell
asleep
on
the
doorstep
in
later
years
when
the
conflict
with
his
father
began
he
always
remembered
these
untroubled
days
with
regrets
the
saturday
football
matches
the
sunday
and
together
with
certain
afternoon
walks
along
the
of
the
canal
where
the
bodies
of
puppies
that
were
old
enough
to
be
taxed
floated
into
beds
of
and
and
hung
swimming
in
shoals
through
the
yellow
water
in
all
these
memories
john
fellows
was
a
benignant
figure
and
this
one
would
hardly
have
guessed
for
john
fellows
was
not
prepossessing
he
was
a
short
man
with
a
head
and
an
immense
his
eyes
were
small
and
lost
in
deep
orbits
so
that
when
his
face
was
ingrained
with
carbon
the
white
of
the
sclerotics
was
intensified
in
a
way
that
made
them
seem
grudging
and
malignant
walking
home
in
his
pit
clothes
and
with
the
dazed
and
hampered
gait
which
is
the
mark
of
men
who
labour
underground
he
always
looked
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
generally
he
been
drinking
but
at
his
soberest
he
was
an
ugly
customer
and
the
blue
enamelled
tin
pot
in
which
he
carried
his
tea
struck
one
as
a
dangerous
weapon
poverty
their
household
never
knew
john
fellows
could
reckon
on
picking
up
his
three
pounds
a
week
and
spent
every
penny
of
it
there
was
always
meat
in
the
house
and
mrs
moseley
knew
better
than
to
serve
him
with
food
that
was
not
freshly
cooked
in
his
way
he
was
an
epicure
although
the
lyttleton
arms
was
the
nearest
abner
would
often
be
sent
out
with
a
jug
to
fetch
his
father
s
supper
beer
from
the
greyhound
or
even
from
the
royal
oak
next
the
football
ground
where
they
kept
astill
s
guaranteed
old
stingo
john
fellows
had
no
use
for
bottled
beer
bottled
he
called
it
he
rarely
smoked
a
pipe
for
lights
were
forbidden
in
the
pit
and
the
habit
of
chewing
had
made
him
prefer
his
nicotine
neat
he
was
shaved
once
a
week
on
saturday
nights
and
upon
this
function
depended
another
of
abner
s
special
joys
the
privilege
of
going
with
him
to
the
barber
s
shop
a
low
boarded
room
heated
by
and
the
breath
of
expectant
expectorant
men
here
wedged
upon
a
bench
at
his
father
s
side
he
would
read
the
comic
papers
that
mr
evans
provided
for
his
customers
some
were
printed
on
pink
paper
and
some
on
green
and
while
abner
absorbed
the
adventures
of
two
alliterative
tramps
he
would
hear
the
of
mr
evans
a
welshman
from
some
remote
radnorshire
village
as
he
talked
to
the
victim
of
his
razor
and
the
other
waiting
customers
mr
evans
was
a
great
authority
on
local
football
and
subscribed
to
a
that
sent
him
a
sheet
of
and
final
scores
long
before
the
evening
edition
of
the
bromwich
arrived
his
knowledge
of
football
politics
and
personalities
was
all
the
more
remarkable
because
saturday
was
his
busiest
day
and
for
that
reason
he
could
never
see
a
game
of
football
played
abner
envied
him
this
abstract
knowledge
of
the
game
but
more
than
mr
evans
he
envied
a
small
boy
with
pink
face
and
plastered
hair
who
wearing
a
long
white
jacket
lathered
the
customers
chins
and
when
mr
evans
had
scraped
them
sprayed
their
faces
with
at
last
with
dramatic
suddenness
this
entertainment
was
withdrawn
john
fellows
developed
a
rash
on
his
chin
which
mr
ingleby
the
chemist
declared
to
be
barber
s
itch
and
mr
evans
became
the
object
of
his
most
particular
hatred
that
bloody
welshman
said
john
fellows
i
reckon
shaving
s
a
dirty
and
so
he
grew
a
beard
but
he
wouldn
t
let
that
evans
trim
it
not
he
all
abner
s
early
pleasures
were
in
some
way
or
other
related
to
his
father
it
was
natural
that
john
fellows
should
take
a
pride
in
his
only
child
he
didn
t
talk
to
him
man
who
chews
tobacco
has
better
work
for
his
jaws
than
he
was
sometimes
amused
by
his
company
and
proud
of
his
sturdiness
and
capacity
for
mischief
he
rejoiced
that
his
son
was
a
bloodworm
much
in
the
same
way
as
his
mates
rejoiced
that
their
terriers
were
good
fighters
he
liked
him
to
be
hard
and
boasted
that
abner
could
take
the
strap
as
he
called
it
without
yelling
indeed
there
was
something
to
boast
about
in
this
for
the
miner
chastened
his
son
with
a
brown
leather
belt
which
as
the
buckle
witnessed
had
once
belonged
to
a
member
of
the
south
staffordshire
regiment
this
belt
he
sometimes
affirmed
had
been
all
round
the
world
before
it
came
into
his
possession
but
abner
was
too
well
acquainted
with
its
other
qualities
to
pursue
the
history
of
this
in
spite
of
his
weekly
lickings
abner
s
life
was
generally
happy
he
had
no
cares
for
the
future
he
knew
that
when
his
schooling
was
over
he
would
be
sent
to
work
at
the
pit
he
wouldn
t
be
sorry
for
that
for
it
seemed
to
him
quite
natural
to
work
underground
to
earn
big
money
and
spend
it
freely
when
that
day
came
he
felt
that
he
and
his
father
would
be
able
to
drink
together
on
equal
terms
by
the
time
that
he
was
fourteen
he
was
already
taller
than
john
fellows
and
meant
to
grow
a
lot
taller
still
he
was
going
to
be
strong
and
to
learn
boxing
perhaps
in
a
few
years
time
he
would
be
able
to
strip
and
fight
in
one
of
the
at
the
wakes
perhaps
in
stripes
of
chocolate
and
yellow
he
might
even
play
football
for
mawne
united
and
talk
like
a
brother
with
the
great
george
harper
in
this
manly
indefinite
future
women
had
no
place
he
had
never
had
a
sister
as
far
as
he
remembered
he
had
never
had
a
mother
and
so
he
followed
the
example
of
his
father
whose
domineering
attitude
towards
the
widow
mrs
moseley
was
beyond
any
doubt
correct
while
mrs
moseley
who
had
her
living
to
make
accepted
it
without
protest
as
a
woman
should
do
towards
girls
themselves
abner
felt
no
positive
hostility
though
he
passed
them
in
the
street
as
a
dog
passes
cats
with
a
solid
appreciation
of
their
potential
evil
but
for
members
of
his
own
sex
who
dallied
with
emasculating
tendernesses
he
and
the
boys
with
whom
he
played
were
full
of
scorn
and
even
of
active
malice
the
worst
libel
that
any
of
his
companions
could
suffer
was
a
chalk
inscription
on
his
own
back
door
of
the
words
tommy
goes
with
cissy
abner
and
his
friends
even
went
so
far
as
to
pester
these
votaries
of
passion
in
their
own
most
sheltered
haunts
above
the
pithead
of
the
great
mawne
colliery
runs
a
lane
skirting
the
ancient
cherry
orchard
of
old
mawne
hall
it
is
short
at
the
end
of
it
the
stands
up
black
and
over
beyond
the
stour
valley
a
desert
of
blackness
stretches
westward
with
thronging
thick
as
masts
of
shipping
in
a
harbour
over
its
hedges
in
the
dusk
light
clouds
of
may
be
seen
but
even
before
the
wind
has
tumbled
the
petals
down
they
are
blackened
by
smuts
from
the
colliery
chimney
this
lane
indeed
was
a
decorous
walking
place
where
one
might
hear
a
patter
of
moving
feet
and
low
laughter
on
any
evening
in
may
but
lower
down
the
slope
past
the
colliery
it
turned
into
another
shadowed
with
elder
stunted
hawthorns
and
trees
which
had
a
darker
reputation
dipping
down
over
the
hillside
this
lane
climbs
back
upon
itself
and
opens
out
again
into
the
orchard
road
this
loop
which
is
called
in
halesby
the
dark
was
the
favourite
hunting
ground
for
abner
and
his
friends
carrying
the
smelly
that
are
sold
on
guy
fawkes
day
they
would
creep
as
quietly
as
possible
under
the
shadows
of
the
trees
selecting
at
a
signalled
moment
some
unfortunate
couple
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
whom
they
might
shame
with
their
lights
often
they
got
their
heads
smacked
but
this
only
served
to
reinforce
their
opinion
that
lovemaking
which
shrank
from
publicity
was
discreditable
one
evening
in
summer
when
abner
was
fourteen
he
took
part
in
one
of
these
expeditions
the
day
had
been
hot
his
father
had
promised
him
that
he
would
make
him
a
kite
in
the
evening
the
split
lath
lay
ready
on
the
table
with
a
roll
of
blue
paper
mrs
moseley
had
boiled
some
paste
and
abner
had
borrowed
enough
string
and
folded
newspaper
to
make
a
tail
as
the
heat
of
the
afternoon
declined
a
gusty
wind
began
to
blow
from
the
west
filling
the
street
with
dust
and
scraps
of
paper
at
six
o
clock
john
fellows
came
back
from
the
pit
the
dust
had
blown
into
his
eyes
that
were
never
very
strong
tears
and
sweat
together
were
tracking
down
through
the
grime
on
his
cheeks
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
abner
s
kite
what
s
that
he
cried
irritably
can
t
yo
give
us
a
moment
s
peace
wait
till
i
ve
swilled
he
had
his
swill
in
the
brewhouse
filling
a
tin
bath
with
black
the
kite
had
become
a
grievance
nattering
away
he
muttered
with
his
head
in
a
roller
towel
werriting
about
kites
on
a
day
that
would
make
a
pig
sweat
blood
abner
who
knew
his
father
got
away
without
any
further
discussion
leaving
mrs
moseley
to
soothe
him
he
went
out
and
played
cricket
in
the
sloping
field
above
the
pit
where
the
ponies
that
have
worked
so
long
underground
that
they
are
blind
are
put
out
to
green
grass
and
to
a
white
mockery
that
they
get
to
know
as
daylight
when
the
boys
came
down
to
play
these
shaggy
creatures
stood
huddled
in
a
corner
and
edged
against
one
another
rubbing
the
out
of
their
matted
coats
if
they
strayed
over
the
field
of
play
abner
and
his
friends
pelted
them
with
pieces
of
slag
from
the
cinder
heap
behind
the
wickets
they
also
threw
slag
at
a
group
of
little
girls
who
dared
to
look
at
them
over
the
broken
hedge
when
the
light
faded
so
much
that
they
could
no
longer
see
to
play
and
the
in
the
ceased
to
grunt
the
boys
all
lay
down
talking
in
the
hedgerow
and
the
ponies
wandered
back
to
pull
at
the
grass
on
either
side
of
the
pitch
at
last
abner
who
was
the
leader
of
the
set
because
he
was
the
strongest
said
let
s
go
down
the
dark
and
scare
some
of
on
such
a
clammy
evening
there
were
certain
to
be
many
lovers
one
of
the
boys
produced
a
halfpenny
packet
of
red
abner
snatched
them
from
him
left
him
crying
and
with
three
others
ran
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
lane
in
the
couples
stirred
uneasily
the
tunnel
under
the
elders
was
full
of
a
hot
odour
of
dust
and
nettles
and
some
kind
of
mint
they
crept
forward
through
the
darkness
in
indian
file
let
s
try
this
one
kid
whispered
a
boy
named
hodgetts
him
over
there
up
agen
the
tree
ere
where
s
the
bloody
box
there
s
somebody
coming
whispered
a
woman
s
voice
they
struck
three
lights
together
the
tunnel
glowed
like
a
furnace
against
the
trunk
of
a
tree
a
short
man
was
leaning
with
a
pale
young
woman
clutched
in
his
arms
abner
saw
that
it
was
his
father
he
dropped
his
match
and
ran
the
boy
hodgetts
came
panting
behind
him
he
was
shouting
kid
kid
did
yo
see
who
he
were
it
were
your
gaffer
abner
turned
and
swiped
at
him
viciously
as
he
ran
joe
hodgetts
crumpled
up
in
the
hedge
howling
abner
went
on
blindly
into
the
cherry
orchard
road
his
heart
thudded
in
his
throat
like
a
he
didn
t
know
where
he
was
he
only
knew
that
he
was
crying
and
that
he
had
broken
his
knuckles
on
joe
hodgett
s
skull
he
rubbed
them
in
the
black
dust
of
the
roadway
and
that
stopped
the
bleeding
but
nothing
it
seemed
could
stop
his
tears
the
second
chapter
when
he
reached
home
half
an
hour
later
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
it
didn
t
matter
to
him
what
his
father
did
he
only
hoped
that
john
fellows
hadn
t
recognised
him
for
that
would
make
him
sure
of
a
belting
still
he
was
glad
that
he
had
given
joe
hodgetts
what
for
he
wasn
t
going
to
have
a
fellow
of
his
own
age
laughing
at
his
father
even
if
his
father
had
let
him
down
by
making
a
fool
of
himself
a
year
later
john
fellows
was
married
in
spite
of
abner
s
scorn
the
proceeding
was
natural
enough
the
man
was
under
forty
and
had
been
a
widower
for
more
than
fourteen
years
the
new
wife
the
woman
of
the
tunnel
was
a
girl
named
alice
higgins
the
elder
daughter
of
an
old
friend
of
fellows
the
timekeeper
at
the
colliery
who
had
lost
his
left
leg
many
years
ago
in
a
crushing
fall
of
coal
she
was
tall
slight
with
a
fair
complexion
and
hair
in
every
physical
particular
the
opposite
of
her
swart
and
stubby
husband
if
such
a
thing
had
to
be
abner
would
have
preferred
the
maturer
charms
of
mrs
moseley
whom
he
knew
so
well
and
liked
to
those
of
any
stranger
indeed
from
the
day
of
his
father
s
marriage
onward
his
life
became
more
complicated
the
very
presence
in
the
house
of
this
new
inmate
a
woman
wielding
authority
whom
he
remembered
only
a
little
time
ago
as
a
girl
with
a
pigtail
down
her
back
made
him
awkward
his
father
had
never
even
mentioned
their
meeting
in
the
he
had
not
recognised
abner
but
the
boy
was
certain
that
alice
had
seen
him
and
remembered
the
consciousness
of
this
mystery
that
they
shared
only
aggravated
the
distrust
and
shyness
that
separated
them
a
shyness
which
alice
herself
honestly
tried
to
overcome
by
little
overtures
of
affection
she
was
quite
determined
in
her
quiet
way
that
she
wasn
t
going
to
be
like
the
stepmothers
of
tradition
she
would
try
to
be
a
real
mother
to
abner
but
how
did
real
mothers
feel
why
don
t
you
call
me
mother
like
other
boys
would
abner
she
said
one
day
coaxingly
abner
only
laughed
she
hated
him
for
laughing
at
her
a
boy
of
his
age
but
the
real
trouble
did
not
begin
till
a
year
later
when
the
first
baby
of
the
new
family
was
coming
it
was
a
bad
time
for
all
of
them
john
fellows
after
fifteen
years
of
a
widower
s
life
had
forgotten
anything
that
he
had
ever
learnt
in
the
way
of
matrimonial
tactics
he
wasn
t
any
longer
a
young
man
and
his
nature
had
inevitably
stiffened
besides
the
coming
of
this
child
was
not
like
the
adventure
of
abner
s
birth
when
he
and
his
first
wife
had
been
two
tender
young
people
rather
overwhelmed
by
the
responsibilities
of
marriage
alice
became
more
conscious
than
ever
of
the
gap
of
years
that
separated
them
the
distance
which
had
always
been
implicit
in
her
idea
of
her
father
s
friend
mr
with
her
it
could
never
be
naturally
and
now
that
she
wanted
somebody
to
take
hold
of
her
and
share
her
fears
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
an
elderly
stranger
she
was
frightened
at
the
thought
of
being
so
utterly
alone
abner
a
member
of
her
own
generation
and
the
son
of
her
baby
s
father
was
a
symbol
of
the
whole
disastrous
circumstance
in
spite
of
all
her
good
resolutions
she
couldn
t
help
letting
off
a
little
of
her
unhappiness
on
him
it
was
against
her
will
that
she
did
so
sometimes
she
cried
with
vexation
at
her
own
irritability
and
resolved
to
overcome
it
then
as
the
months
dragged
on
she
began
to
wonder
if
it
were
worth
while
tiring
herself
out
with
good
resolutions
or
anything
else
in
the
world
she
found
herself
becoming
wilfully
vixenish
with
her
husband
that
didn
t
matter
for
she
seldom
saw
him
but
a
little
later
a
new
emotion
stronger
and
more
positively
devastating
than
any
that
she
had
known
before
seized
her
it
was
a
thing
that
she
couldn
t
understand
she
felt
as
if
some
strange
dark
spirit
had
invaded
and
perverted
her
consciousness
making
her
think
madly
and
not
in
the
least
as
she
wanted
to
think
filling
her
with
a
mixture
of
hate
and
jealousy
towards
abner
this
passion
would
not
let
her
be
however
tired
and
jaded
she
were
the
fiend
was
ready
to
tear
her
she
could
not
see
the
boy
without
hating
him
she
felt
just
like
a
cat
with
kittens
who
spits
at
the
kittens
of
another
cat
she
had
plenty
of
opportunities
for
showing
her
hatred
abner
was
now
fifteen
his
schooling
was
finished
and
he
had
begun
to
work
at
the
colliery
leading
the
ponies
that
drag
trollies
of
coal
along
the
galleries
of
the
pit
he
found
it
quite
good
fun
the
pony
of
which
he
had
charge
was
very
old
and
quite
blind
for
it
had
worked
in
mawne
pit
since
before
abner
was
born
he
found
it
slower
than
a
pony
should
be
and
spent
the
first
sunday
after
he
had
started
work
in
searching
uffdown
wood
for
an
with
which
he
might
induce
the
pony
to
go
faster
when
he
had
found
one
he
fitted
a
pin
in
the
end
of
it
a
few
minutes
after
six
every
evening
the
cage
would
come
clanking
up
to
the
and
before
it
settled
with
a
jerk
abner
black
with
would
shoot
out
like
a
hare
and
go
whistling
home
to
his
tea
he
whistled
because
there
was
always
a
curious
lightening
of
his
heart
at
the
change
from
the
murk
of
the
pit
to
daylight
it
was
spring
when
he
started
work
every
evening
as
he
passed
the
cherry
orchard
he
heard
the
whistle
of
a
blackbird
poised
on
the
topmost
bough
of
one
of
the
foamy
trees
he
wondered
exuberantly
if
he
could
find
its
nest
some
day
he
even
collected
a
couple
of
pebbles
to
put
in
the
place
of
eggs
but
when
he
got
home
there
was
no
mrs
moseley
waiting
with
a
piece
ready
buttered
and
a
cup
of
steaming
alice
dragging
about
the
kitchen
greeting
him
with
jealous
eyes
abner
you
dirty
little
beast
she
would
say
don
t
you
dare
soil
that
table
now
mind
your
filthy
hands
it
s
summat
to
have
your
father
let
alone
yo
here
that
s
your
father
s
towel
loose
it
quick
none
of
this
was
very
serious
but
it
made
a
great
difference
to
abner
he
was
continually
being
shocked
to
find
that
small
details
in
the
arrangement
of
the
house
such
as
the
position
of
a
chair
which
had
always
been
his
favourite
were
being
altered
from
day
to
day
alice
had
a
fever
for
making
freakish
variations
in
the
kitchen
furniture
she
couldn
t
be
happy
to
see
things
in
the
same
place
for
two
days
running
she
was
never
satisfied
making
alterations
as
it
seemed
simply
for
the
sake
of
finding
fresh
work
to
do
yet
always
working
under
protest
her
presence
became
dragged
and
unhappy
and
the
only
results
of
her
unnatural
labours
were
untidiness
and
confusion
even
john
fellows
could
not
help
being
irritated
by
these
fruitless
activities
his
first
wife
and
later
mrs
moseley
had
known
that
it
was
as
much
as
their
lives
were
worth
not
to
have
the
house
swept
and
speckless
by
evening
ready
to
receive
the
pit
dirt
of
the
master
now
when
he
came
home
to
find
alice
crouching
over
the
fireplace
in
her
bulged
apron
smearing
red
raddle
on
the
hearth
without
as
much
as
a
kettle
boiling
he
would
stand
still
in
the
doorway
a
short
aggressive
figure
and
ask
the
wench
what
she
thought
she
was
doing
croodled
down
there
in
the
grate
and
him
waiting
for
his
tea
then
alice
with
her
pale
face
averted
would
snarl
back
at
him
and
his
dirt
in
the
voice
in
which
she
used
to
gossip
with
mrs
hobbs
three
doors
down
all
the
women
in
hackett
s
cottages
eventually
developed
the
same
sort
of
voice
john
fellows
really
behaved
rather
well
he
knew
that
it
wasn
t
worth
while
grumbling
reflected
that
all
women
were
more
than
usually
unreasonable
at
these
times
and
so
he
would
sometimes
start
his
washing
in
the
scullery
with
cold
water
knowing
well
that
in
a
moment
the
little
vixen
would
be
at
his
elbow
with
a
boiling
saucepan
then
he
would
catch
hold
of
her
in
his
grimy
arms
and
she
would
cry
out
shrilly
that
he
was
a
great
mucky
beast
and
tell
him
to
give
a
little
sparring
of
this
kind
often
put
him
in
a
good
humour
and
alice
quick
to
recognise
the
peculiar
power
which
her
physical
presence
still
exercised
on
her
husband
sometimes
presumed
on
it
so
far
that
these
passages
of
arms
ended
in
tears
at
such
times
it
frightened
her
to
see
him
suddenly
revealed
to
her
as
a
strange
hard
man
nearly
double
her
own
age
with
whom
she
was
unaccountably
living
even
maternity
couldn
t
make
her
feel
anything
but
a
little
girl
in
the
face
of
his
strange
maturity
she
felt
that
john
fellows
knew
as
well
as
she
did
that
she
was
only
making
believe
to
be
a
married
woman
he
had
shown
it
more
than
once
by
his
roughness
to
her
but
that
didn
t
really
matter
as
long
as
the
neighbours
never
guessed
her
neighbours
and
more
particularly
abner
for
if
abner
once
knew
the
truth
she
could
never
again
be
mistress
in
her
own
house
that
was
how
she
put
it
and
she
was
so
jealous
of
this
imaginary
dignity
and
at
the
same
time
so
conscious
of
its
artificiality
that
she
could
never
cease
trying
to
put
abner
in
his
place
it
was
bad
enough
for
alice
that
her
husband
should
laugh
at
her
certainly
she
determined
she
wasn
t
going
to
stand
anything
of
that
kind
from
abner
and
though
abner
himself
had
not
yet
shown
her
any
signs
of
disrespect
she
took
great
pains
to
give
him
no
opportunity
of
doing
so
by
repressing
him
whenever
she
had
the
chance
just
as
john
fellows
had
once
approved
in
abner
the
aggressive
tendencies
that
went
to
the
making
of
a
bloodworm
he
now
approved
in
alice
so
little
and
so
desperately
game
the
temper
that
made
things
so
uncomfortable
for
abner
as
long
as
she
kept
her
temper
for
the
boy
and
didn
t
try
any
of
her
tricks
on
him
it
didn
t
matter
and
since
it
pleased
john
fellows
who
loved
nothing
better
than
a
to
see
his
little
alice
bare
her
teeth
the
girl
played
up
to
him
knowing
that
her
husband
would
keep
abner
from
hitting
back
as
long
as
the
game
pleased
him
abner
suffered
her
sullenly
he
soon
found
out
that
it
wasn
t
worth
while
disputing
with
her
and
indeed
sometimes
her
violence
wasting
itself
against
his
unconcern
recoiled
on
her
so
that
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
in
tears
this
vexed
her
partly
for
shame
and
partly
because
she
saw
that
crying
which
she
had
always
regarded
as
her
last
and
most
telling
weapon
had
no
effect
on
him
they
were
both
of
them
little
more
than
children
in
the
end
it
came
to
this
abner
realising
that
hackett
s
cottages
could
never
again
be
a
real
home
to
him
decided
with
the
philosophy
which
is
learned
early
among
people
who
have
to
fight
for
themselves
that
he
must
cut
his
losses
and
strike
out
for
himself
as
soon
as
he
could
manage
to
do
so
he
knew
that
for
the
present
he
could
not
afford
to
find
another
lodging
but
already
he
was
doing
a
man
s
work
at
the
colliery
and
soon
he
would
be
earning
a
man
s
wages
when
she
realised
this
alice
was
sorry
that
she
had
helped
to
drive
him
away
for
she
had
dreamed
pleasantly
of
all
the
money
that
she
would
soon
be
able
to
handle
and
had
decided
to
buy
a
piano
for
the
parlour
and
a
with
a
pink
toilet
set
for
the
front
bedroom
it
would
be
a
pity
she
reflected
to
get
rid
of
a
full
in
exchange
for
a
little
personal
dignity
so
suddenly
relenting
she
became
towards
abner
the
incarnation
of
sweetness
abner
however
wasn
t
having
any
even
though
he
didn
t
see
through
her
he
felt
that
her
attitude
was
rather
too
good
to
be
true
for
the
present
he
went
on
his
way
paying
regularly
his
weekly
lodge
and
the
subscription
to
an
industrial
that
had
been
taken
out
in
the
year
of
his
birth
to
provide
for
his
burial
but
with
the
fulfilment
of
these
obligations
his
dealings
with
hackett
s
cottages
ceased
he
became
a
lodger
pure
and
simple
only
appearing
at
night
when
the
others
had
gone
to
bed
tired
and
ready
to
tumble
into
the
nest
of
blankets
which
alice
had
not
disturbed
since
he
left
them
in
the
morning
she
wasn
t
going
to
put
herself
out
for
him
she
said
in
those
days
she
didn
t
feel
inclined
to
put
herself
out
for
anybody
unfortunately
she
couldn
t
have
it
both
ways
for
by
frightening
abner
away
with
her
temper
she
had
lost
the
use
of
his
strength
in
the
heavier
work
of
the
house
she
knew
that
she
couldn
t
ask
her
husband
to
help
her
he
hadn
t
married
her
for
that
her
weary
and
palpably
interested
attempts
to
coax
abner
back
to
her
were
a
failure
without
showing
a
vestige
of
bitterness
he
went
stolidly
on
his
way
and
so
she
resigned
herself
with
a
sort
of
tired
pride
to
the
heaviness
of
her
lot
in
a
way
this
desertion
of
hackett
s
cottages
was
a
good
thing
for
abner
for
it
drove
him
out
into
the
open
air
and
rid
his
lungs
of
the
that
he
breathed
in
the
galleries
of
the
pit
joe
hodgetts
now
more
than
ever
his
friend
and
admirer
shared
these
joys
together
they
roamed
over
all
the
sweet
that
ponders
above
the
smoke
of
mawne
they
did
not
know
that
it
was
beautiful
they
only
knew
that
there
were
banks
of
hazel
under
which
one
might
play
pitch
and
toss
or
nap
without
the
fear
of
a
policeman
that
there
were
cool
streams
with
bottoms
of
red
sand
in
which
it
was
good
to
bathe
that
there
were
rabbits
that
came
out
timidly
in
the
evening
to
be
shot
with
catapults
and
that
rustled
the
trees
on
the
edge
of
uffdown
wood
and
then
emerged
with
clapping
wings
both
boys
had
the
instincts
of
poachers
and
in
the
spring
another
partner
joined
them
an
equivocal
terrier
with
a
sandy
coat
a
long
thin
tail
and
a
guttersnipe
s
intelligence
which
abner
got
for
the
asking
from
a
miner
at
mawne
who
didn
t
think
the
beast
worth
the
cost
of
a
licence
he
couldn
t
house
the
animal
in
hackett
s
cottages
for
alice
couldn
t
abear
dogs
the
dirty
beasts
abner
s
old
friend
mrs
moseley
came
to
his
help
the
dog
now
christened
tiger
found
a
home
in
her
washhouse
living
among
his
hoarded
bones
on
a
strip
of
sacking
in
the
beneath
the
copper
here
he
would
lie
in
the
evening
waiting
for
his
master
his
thin
snout
pressed
to
the
ground
between
extended
paws
motionless
pretending
to
be
asleep
when
he
heard
abner
s
step
approaching
he
would
lie
still
with
gleaming
open
eyes
and
wait
for
his
name
to
be
called
then
he
would
leap
out
and
lick
the
from
abner
s
face
with
his
tongue
even
mrs
moseley
who
fed
him
was
nothing
to
tiger
if
abner
were
there
together
they
would
go
out
into
the
golden
evening
hunting
rabbits
which
abner
would
sometimes
bring
home
to
mrs
moseley
who
had
a
way
of
cooking
them
with
onions
soused
in
milk
they
were
a
great
treat
to
her
for
being
a
widow
and
no
longer
employed
in
john
fellows
s
house
she
rarely
tasted
meat
sharing
the
proceeds
of
their
hunting
abner
and
mrs
moseley
would
sit
late
over
their
tea
next
day
and
tiger
under
the
table
would
crack
the
rabbit
s
head
and
lick
out
the
brains
with
his
pointed
tongue
later
in
the
week
mrs
moseley
would
sell
the
to
a
man
for
twopence
she
was
really
very
fond
of
abner
and
even
if
he
hadn
t
brought
food
to
the
house
she
would
have
been
glad
of
his
visits
for
company
as
she
called
it
because
he
kept
the
dog
there
and
because
he
was
happy
in
mrs
moseley
s
society
abner
made
her
cottage
his
real
home
it
stood
last
in
one
of
a
series
of
parallel
streets
that
climbed
desperately
out
of
the
dust
of
the
stourton
road
towards
a
low
crest
facing
uffdown
and
the
other
hills
of
its
chain
the
lower
story
looked
out
on
a
wall
of
the
local
blue
brick
but
the
windows
of
the
bedroom
a
stuffy
chamber
in
which
the
widow
spent
the
greater
part
of
her
day
and
which
the
district
nurse
penetrated
every
morning
in
a
whiff
of
iodoform
for
the
purpose
of
dressing
mrs
moseley
s
bad
leg
commanded
beyond
a
foreground
of
blue
distances
from
which
the
hill
air
could
have
blown
in
cleanly
the
doctor
had
told
mrs
moseley
that
her
leg
would
never
heal
unless
she
gave
it
rest
and
since
all
her
relatives
were
now
married
and
too
prosperous
to
give
the
old
woman
a
thought
she
was
left
to
herself
hobbling
from
the
bedroom
to
the
kitchen
whenever
it
was
necessary
to
bank
up
the
fire
on
the
hob
stood
a
teapot
brewing
a
decoction
of
tannin
which
had
long
since
ruined
her
digestion
but
was
the
thing
for
which
she
cared
most
in
life
she
called
it
her
cup
of
abner
rarely
noticed
what
an
effort
she
made
to
receive
him
cheerfully
when
he
came
for
his
dog
he
didn
t
see
how
slow
and
painful
her
movements
were
becoming
she
never
seemed
to
him
any
different
from
the
mrs
moseley
whom
he
had
always
known
and
taken
for
granted
until
one
day
she
was
put
to
bed
and
forbidden
to
move
at
all
she
had
spent
the
whole
morning
crying
to
herself
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
day
was
not
distant
when
she
would
have
to
be
moved
to
stourton
workhouse
to
be
carried
downstairs
and
placed
in
the
black
van
before
a
crowd
of
gaping
neighbours
dirty
women
with
babies
in
their
arms
she
had
always
been
shy
of
the
people
who
lived
near
her
a
country
woman
she
felt
out
of
place
with
these
industrial
folk
she
wished
very
much
that
she
might
die
when
abner
came
into
the
house
that
evening
he
found
the
grate
cold
and
full
of
ashes
he
ran
into
the
washhouse
to
fetch
tiger
but
the
dog
was
not
there
then
he
heard
the
voice
of
mrs
moseley
distressed
and
quavering
calling
him
from
above
and
a
minute
later
tiger
came
scampering
downstairs
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
from
his
nest
on
mrs
moseley
s
bed
abner
standing
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
listened
to
the
story
of
her
troubles
she
wouldn
t
tell
him
much
about
them
and
nothing
at
all
about
the
deeper
fears
that
haunted
her
she
told
him
to
get
a
cup
of
tea
for
himself
but
when
he
suggested
bringing
another
upstairs
to
her
she
was
scandalised
even
though
she
was
old
enough
to
be
his
grandmother
she
thought
that
this
would
be
indelicate
besides
she
couldn
t
be
quite
certain
that
the
cleanliness
of
her
bedroom
was
beyond
reproach
and
had
determined
that
before
any
one
visited
her
leg
or
no
leg
she
must
spend
a
day
putting
things
straight
and
of
course
the
floor
must
be
scrubbed
with
carbolic
soap
she
begged
abner
to
get
her
some
from
mr
ingleby
s
shop
later
as
the
days
of
her
imprisonment
lengthened
she
found
that
she
couldn
t
be
so
independent
after
all
at
an
immense
sacrifice
she
consented
to
the
presence
of
abner
in
her
room
that
narrow
chamber
which
the
bulging
nearly
filled
where
in
fact
it
was
the
only
piece
of
furniture
here
abner
would
sit
in
the
hot
evenings
of
summer
staring
through
the
closed
windows
at
the
distant
hills
while
mrs
moseley
in
a
tired
unhurried
voice
talked
of
things
that
had
happened
in
his
childhood
and
other
days
more
remote
when
his
mother
had
been
alive
the
old
woman
had
always
been
fond
of
abner
always
a
little
frightened
of
his
father
and
now
that
this
tall
youth
was
repaying
her
in
some
degree
for
the
care
that
she
had
given
him
in
his
childhood
she
became
very
tender
toward
him
at
times
his
coming
made
her
vaguely
emotional
her
tenderness
helping
her
to
realise
how
very
lonely
she
was
sometimes
when
she
heard
his
step
in
the
room
beneath
her
she
would
very
nearly
cry
and
the
dog
tiger
lying
on
the
patchwork
quilt
would
lick
her
outstretched
arm
she
began
to
count
on
his
visits
indeed
rather
than
lose
him
she
would
even
have
consented
to
have
the
bedroom
windows
opened
he
never
spoke
of
his
own
accord
about
alice
but
mrs
moseley
compelled
him
to
do
so
inquiring
every
day
how
she
was
getting
on
she
had
promised
john
fellows
to
whom
she
was
always
grateful
for
her
old
employment
that
she
would
be
in
the
house
during
the
confinement
and
to
lend
the
doctor
a
hand
john
fellows
remembered
well
what
a
tower
of
strength
she
had
been
at
the
time
when
abner
was
born
in
those
days
she
had
possessed
a
comfortable
figure
and
a
jolly
laugh
i
don
t
want
her
there
alice
had
protested
i
d
rather
have
with
me
nor
her
she
didn
t
object
to
mrs
moseley
in
herself
but
she
was
suspicious
of
any
one
who
had
known
the
house
before
she
came
there
convinced
that
the
old
woman
would
sniff
at
her
improvements
and
perhaps
make
mischief
poking
her
nose
into
all
the
drawers
and
cupboards
while
she
the
mistress
was
in
bed
and
perhaps
john
fellows
would
compare
mrs
moseley
s
cooking
with
her
own
but
her
husband
wasn
t
having
any
nonsense
of
that
kind
silly
wench
yo
don
t
know
what
s
good
for
you
he
said
considering
the
matter
settled
alice
cried
but
he
didn
t
take
any
notice
of
that
sort
of
thing
as
the
time
drew
nearer
it
distressed
mrs
moseley
to
think
that
she
might
still
be
in
bed
when
she
was
wanted
she
wished
to
be
there
not
only
for
the
sake
of
the
husband
but
also
because
she
couldn
t
afford
to
miss
the
ten
shillings
that
her
fortnight
s
work
would
bring
her
to
say
nothing
of
the
fortnight
s
keep
abner
was
impatient
with
her
questions
oh
don
t
yo
worry
about
he
said
she
s
not
worth
it
got
a
temper
like
a
you
shouldn
t
say
that
dear
said
mrs
moseley
she
s
the
mother
that
the
lord
s
given
you
and
it
s
hard
days
for
women
when
they
re
like
that
i
ve
been
through
it
myself
so
i
know
what
they
feels
like
it
ll
be
different
when
the
baby
comes
but
abner
was
sure
it
wouldn
t
be
different
it
would
take
more
than
a
baby
to
change
alice
besides
she
bain
t
my
mother
he
said
a
regular
cat
that
s
what
she
bin
you
m
the
nearest
i
ve
ever
had
to
a
mrs
moseley
smiled
secretly
when
he
wasn
t
looking
she
wiped
her
left
eye
on
the
patchwork
counterpane
the
third
chapter
in
the
middle
of
a
summer
night
abner
s
father
came
blundering
into
his
son
s
bedroom
come
along
get
a
shift
on
you
he
said
go
and
holler
to
mrs
moseley
and
then
run
on
to
the
doctor
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
candle
which
lit
up
his
surly
face
and
threw
the
folds
on
either
side
of
the
grimy
wrinkles
into
relief
his
eyes
were
bleared
and
angry
for
he
had
been
sleeping
like
a
log
and
resented
any
disturbance
at
night
it
bain
t
no
good
my
going
for
her
said
abner
sleepily
she
s
got
a
bad
bad
leg
be
bosted
shouted
john
fellows
she
ll
have
to
come
if
i
send
for
her
tak
your
hook
now
while
abner
dressed
his
father
was
prowling
from
room
to
room
letting
the
tallow
from
the
candle
drip
down
the
front
of
his
trousers
and
shouting
at
the
boy
to
hurry
up
from
time
to
time
in
a
few
minutes
abner
was
ready
and
had
crossed
the
patch
of
waste
ground
that
lay
between
the
terrace
and
the
stourton
road
this
highway
was
more
desolate
than
he
had
ever
seen
it
before
in
some
of
the
upper
windows
subdued
were
burning
but
most
of
them
took
on
the
gray
light
of
a
moon
that
could
not
be
seen
he
was
halfway
into
halesby
before
he
really
woke
then
in
the
cool
night
air
he
forgot
his
grudge
against
his
father
for
waking
him
even
the
foul
dust
of
the
stourton
road
smelt
sweet
he
had
never
felt
fitter
nor
more
awake
in
his
life
as
he
reached
mrs
moseley
s
door
tiger
began
to
bark
he
heard
the
voice
of
mrs
moseley
trying
to
soothe
the
beast
then
he
picked
up
some
pebbles
and
threw
them
against
the
window
panes
and
a
moment
later
the
old
woman
looked
out
tiger
scrambling
into
the
window
beside
her
our
father
wants
you
he
called
and
i
ve
got
to
go
for
the
dear
dear
said
mrs
moseley
i
knew
it
would
happen
like
this
i
wouldn
t
disappoint
your
father
for
anything
that
i
wouldn
t
don
t
you
take
no
notice
of
it
abner
urged
don
t
you
come
i
ll
tell
em
the
doctor
won
t
let
she
shook
her
head
solemnly
and
disappeared
from
the
window
abner
exhilarated
with
the
night
air
ran
on
to
the
doctor
s
house
this
gentleman
appeared
to
resent
his
call
abner
was
told
to
wait
below
so
that
he
might
carry
the
bag
he
stood
there
in
a
garden
heavy
with
the
perfume
of
stocks
in
the
meadows
along
the
stour
a
corncrake
was
calling
he
wondered
what
kind
of
bird
it
was
and
whether
it
was
easy
to
kill
he
didn
t
mind
how
long
the
doctor
kept
him
waiting
on
the
way
back
to
hackett
s
cottages
dr
moorhouse
spoke
very
little
he
asked
abner
the
kind
of
questions
he
usually
put
to
young
people
and
grunted
in
reply
as
if
he
hadn
t
heard
what
abner
said
are
you
john
fellows
s
son
he
asked
and
then
how
old
are
you
when
abner
said
that
he
was
going
in
seventeen
he
grunted
it
scarcely
seemed
possible
that
more
than
sixteen
years
had
passed
since
in
the
same
small
house
of
hackett
s
cottages
he
had
ushered
this
tall
youth
into
the
world
it
filled
him
with
a
kind
of
discontent
to
realise
that
for
all
these
years
he
had
been
moving
in
the
same
groove
in
a
vicious
circle
that
had
brought
him
back
once
more
to
this
identical
point
only
it
hadn
t
been
so
hard
to
turn
out
at
night
sixteen
years
ago
a
dog
s
life
people
didn
t
realise
it
there
was
ingleby
the
chemist
a
sensible
man
in
most
things
fool
enough
to
make
his
only
son
a
doctor
when
they
reached
hackett
s
cottages
they
found
the
door
of
number
eleven
open
and
a
light
shining
in
it
john
fellows
came
out
to
meet
them
and
insisted
on
shaking
hands
with
the
doctor
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
been
sampling
the
bottle
of
brandy
that
is
always
in
evidence
on
these
occasions
she
s
all
right
he
said
she
s
all
right
doctor
a
tough
wench
she
is
tougher
than
the
other
he
turned
on
abner
get
the
fire
lit
sharp
now
else
i
ll
drap
thee
one
fill
the
big
kettle
plenty
of
hot
water

somebody
came
limping
downstairs

shouted
the
doctor
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
what
do
you
mean
by
it
woman
didn
t
i
tell
you
to
stay
in
bed
till
i
let
you
out
of
all
the
damned
foolishness
mrs
moseley
smiled
her
tired
patient
smile
but
the
doctor
knew
she
was
in
pain
he
couldn
t
help
admiring
her
you
ll
forgive
me
all
right
doctor
she
said
now
what
could
i
do
with
the
poor
young
thing
lying
here
like
that
and
after
all
i
d
promised
mr
fellows
here
don
t
you
remember
the
last
time
no
i
m
hanged
if
i
ll
forgive
you
he
smiled
you
re
an
obstinate
old
fool
now
run
along
upstairs
if
you
lose
your
leg
it
s
not
my
abner
was
left
alone
in
the
kitchen
with
his
father
while
the
boy
raked
out
the
ashes
from
the
grate
and
lit
the
fire
john
fellows
took
the
brandy
from
the
cupboard
and
had
another
swig
putting
the
neck
of
the
bottle
in
his
mouth
he
said
ah
and
smacked
his
lips
then
he
went
out
into
the
strip
of
garden
at
the
back
and
walked
violently
up
and
down
it
was
almost
light
when
he
returned
he
was
sweating
and
quarrelsome
abner
had
a
bad
time
of
it
now
that
his
poor
mother
was
suffering
like
this
john
fellows
hoped
he
d
be
sorry
for
the
way
he
d
used
her
if
anything
went
implied
gloomily
that
something
probably
would
be
to
blame
for
it
to
give
his
fuddled
brain
the
chance
for
indignation
that
it
wanted
there
entered
the
dog
tiger
fawning
ingratiating
he
had
escaped
from
mrs
moseley
s
house
and
followed
the
scent
of
her
or
of
abner
he
jumped
up
at
abner
yelping
with
joy
for
a
second
john
fellow
s
stared
at
him
stupidly
then
he
burst
out
with
and
here
s
that
bloody
dog
again
your
mother
s
told
you
she
can
t
it
but
she
s
no
sooner
upstairs
he
slipped
the
belt
from
his
waist
and
lashed
at
the
wretched
tiger
s
quarters
the
dog
squealed
piteously
for
a
moment
abner
saw
red
he
didn
t
see
his
father
any
longer
only
a
stubby
man
shorter
than
himself
staring
at
him
with
bloodshot
eyes
and
sweat
trickling
down
two
grimy
wrinkles
he
would
have
knocked
his
father
down
if
mrs
moseley
hadn
t
suddenly
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
asking
what
the
noise
was
about
the
sound
of
her
voice
steadied
both
of
them
as
they
stood
staring
hatred
at
one
another
and
abner
s
anger
passed
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
mrs
moseley
standing
between
them
brought
with
her
a
pungent
odour
of
some
antiseptic
the
smell
impressed
abner
with
the
moment
s
seriousness
he
was
suddenly
sorry
for
alice
he
even
wished
that
he
had
been
more
patient
with
her
then
the
whole
sky
was
shaken
with
the
vibrations
of
the
great
bull
at
mawne
colliery
he
slipped
into
his
pit
clothes
left
his
father
staring
and
hurried
from
the
house
when
he
came
back
from
his
turn
at
night
the
sense
of
stress
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
in
the
work
of
the
day
returned
on
the
doorstep
of
number
eleven
he
felt
intensely
nervous
something
was
going
to
happen
perhaps
something
had
happened
already
the
house
was
quiet
in
the
kitchen
a
fire
was
burning
that
made
for
cheerfulness
in
spite
of
the
heat
all
this
was
attributable
to
mrs
moseley
who
now
appeared
with
an
encouraging
smile
she
told
him
that
alice
s
baby
had
been
born
at
ten
o
clock
and
when
i
got
her
clean
and
comfortable
and
washed
the
baby
i
thought
well
now
while
i
m
on
my
legs
i
may
as
well
have
a
bit
of
a
tidy
a
lovely
boy
she
said
oh
what
a
beautiful
like
his
father
abner
didn
t
want
to
hear
about
the
baby
he
stuck
to
his
obstinate
determination
not
to
countenance
the
affair
at
all
and
mrs
moseley
laughed
at
him
for
behaving
like
a
baby
himself
he
asked
her
what
had
happened
to
his
father
i
haven
t
seen
him
not
since
you
went
to
work
but
men
s
best
out
of
the
way
at
these
abner
guessed
that
once
having
started
to
drink
his
father
had
probably
been
drinking
all
day
and
might
well
by
this
time
be
lying
drunk
in
some
hedge
at
the
back
of
the
royal
oak
mrs
moseley
rebuked
him
you
re
hard
on
your
father
abner
she
said
it
s
a
bad
time
for
a
man
when
he
feels
he
can
t
do
nothing
you
don
t
love
and
honour
your
father
the
way
you
all
through
the
fortnight
of
alice
s
mrs
moseley
did
her
best
to
keep
the
peace
of
the
house
and
to
reconcile
abner
to
the
new
state
of
things
she
made
him
feel
almost
as
much
at
home
as
he
had
been
in
the
old
days
limping
downstairs
in
the
evening
to
talk
to
him
alice
was
very
jealous
when
she
heard
them
talking
below
on
most
evenings
they
sat
alone
in
the
kitchen
together
but
sometimes
they
went
out
into
the
strip
of
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
to
a
wooden
bench
screened
by
a
straggling
hedge
of
scarlet
runners
they
sat
there
often
in
silence
till
the
sky
darkened
reflecting
above
the
western
horizon
all
the
furnaces
of
mawne
and
no
one
disturbed
them
for
john
fellows
having
once
yielded
to
the
bottle
had
continued
his
celebrations
of
the
event
after
all
such
things
didn
t
happen
very
often
one
evening
mrs
moseley
brought
down
the
baby
for
abner
to
see
look
at
him
abner
she
said
bain
t
he
a
pretty
dear
bain
t
he
a
little
lovee
whatever
the
baby
may
have
been
he
certainly
wasn
t
pretty
but
there
was
something
in
his
helplessness
that
appealed
to
abner
s
generosity
in
spite
of
his
prejudices
he
couldn
t
see
himself
being
vindictive
toward
this
comical
creature
he
touched
the
baby
s
downy
wrinkled
face
with
his
hand
the
creature
made
a
sucking
noise
seeking
abner
s
fingers
with
his
lips
and
at
the
same
moment
tiger
with
a
snarl
took
abner
s
calf
between
his
teeth
and
with
the
gentlest
pressure
threatened
to
bite
him
there
you
are
said
mrs
moseley
look
at
jealousy
you
and
tiger
are
a
pair
and
that
s
the
truth
he
laughed
but
for
all
that
he
didn
t
look
forward
happily
to
mrs
moseley
s
departure
he
felt
that
the
baby
would
only
serve
to
make
alice
more
intolerably
important
when
on
the
thirteenth
night
a
incredibly
diminished
alice
came
down
to
sit
for
a
couple
of
hours
on
the
sofa
he
decided
to
ask
mrs
moseley
to
take
him
into
her
house
as
a
lodger
the
money
will
come
in
handy
he
urged
i
could
sleep
in
the
washhouse
with
old
but
she
wouldn
t
think
of
it
i
couldn
t
do
it
she
said
i
wouldn
t
like
to
put
your
father
out
not
if
it
was
ever
so
john
s
been
a
good
friend
to
me
i
don
t
know
how
i
could
have
lived
all
these
years
without
he
s
got
a
sight
more
out
of
yo
than
ever
yo
got
out
of
him
abner
grumbled
but
again
she
said
no
it
is
true
because
she
felt
that
alice
might
make
it
the
occasion
for
a
quarrel
and
partly
because
much
as
she
loved
abner
she
knew
that
her
strength
would
not
allow
her
to
look
after
him
properly
on
many
days
of
late
she
hadn
t
really
been
fit
to
do
her
own
housework
and
so
she
fought
shy
for
abner
s
sake
as
much
as
her
own
of
the
arrangement
that
he
suggested
the
money
alas
was
very
tempting
abner
who
didn
t
generally
notice
things
particularly
and
had
always
taken
people
like
mrs
moseley
for
granted
had
not
appreciated
the
changes
that
were
slowly
overtaking
her
he
didn
t
see
the
slight
contraction
of
her
brows
that
had
lately
become
a
fixed
expression
of
the
pain
that
wouldn
t
let
her
be
neither
he
nor
alice
nor
john
fellows
were
aware
of
mrs
moseley
s
suffering
but
the
doctor
on
his
daily
visits
saw
how
gamely
she
was
fighting
and
said
nothing
for
he
knew
that
to
abstain
from
obvious
advice
was
the
highest
tribute
that
he
could
pay
to
her
fortitude
he
knew
that
there
was
trouble
ahead
but
he
still
joked
with
mrs
moseley
and
she
in
answer
returned
him
a
smile
that
struck
him
as
particularly
sweet
in
this
plain
old
woman
making
excuse
for
the
reproach
that
remained
unspoken
in
the
end
abner
piqued
at
her
refusal
quarrelled
with
her
any
one
d
think
i
was
likely
to
be
a
nuisance
he
said
mrs
moseley
shook
her
head
she
nearly
told
him
all
her
reasons
against
his
plan
but
when
she
came
to
speak
of
them
her
lips
trembled
she
knew
that
she
couldn
t
keep
up
much
longer
on
the
fifteenth
day
she
left
hackett
s
cottages
alice
who
paid
her
the
agreed
ten
shillings
from
a
leather
purse
that
she
kept
wrapped
up
in
a
handkerchief
under
her
pillow
thought
it
rather
shabby
of
her
not
to
offer
to
stay
longer
you
d
think
it
d
be
the
least
she
could
do
after
all
your
kindness
she
said
to
her
husband
john
fellows
not
to
be
buttered
with
flattery
merely
grunted
it
took
mrs
moseley
more
than
an
hour
to
walk
the
mile
home
the
doctor
passing
in
his
trap
saw
her
resting
on
a
doorstep
in
the
stourton
road
he
pretended
not
to
recognise
her
but
scribbled
a
note
on
his
list
that
she
was
to
be
visited
in
the
afternoon
toward
evening
he
stumped
up
the
crooked
stairs
and
stood
at
the
bottom
of
her
bed
looking
at
her
with
a
curious
smile
on
his
lips
she
knew
it
was
no
good
making
excuses
let
s
have
a
look
at
it
he
said
and
then
well
my
dear
this
means
six
weeks
in
bed
you
know
that
don
t
you
ten
shillings
worth
eh
mrs
moseley
conscious
of
the
fact
that
it
was
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
ten
shillings
said
nothing
if
he
only
realised
what
a
blessed
relief
it
was
to
her
to
be
off
her
feet
again
when
alice
came
downstairs
again
butter
wouldn
t
melt
in
her
mouth
abner
had
never
known
her
so
studiously
charming
from
the
first
it
was
as
if
she
smiled
for
goodness
sake
let
us
forget
what
has
happened
and
make
a
new
start
and
he
couldn
t
very
well
refuse
to
meet
her
at
the
same
time
he
found
it
difficult
to
conceal
his
suspicions
that
she
was
getting
at
him
in
some
covert
female
way
the
situation
would
have
been
easier
to
handle
if
alice
hadn
t
been
a
trifle
pale
and
interesting
she
didn
t
pick
up
very
quickly
and
now
of
course
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
housework
she
had
to
look
after
the
baby
who
was
already
suffering
from
its
mother
s
dietetic
indiscretions
like
many
thin
young
women
alice
could
never
conquer
her
inclination
for
sweets
and
for
vinegar
and
as
a
consequence
the
child
was
noisy
and
irritable
her
housework
went
to
the
wall
and
in
despair
she
turned
to
abner
to
help
her
out
nothing
could
have
been
sweeter
than
her
temper
and
though
he
didn
t
believe
in
it
he
couldn
t
help
being
sorry
for
her
and
did
what
she
asked
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
already
a
little
interested
in
the
baby
the
smallness
of
its
limbs
and
the
timid
uncertainty
of
its
movements
fascinated
him
he
regarded
it
with
a
certain
benignant
curiosity
much
as
he
might
have
looked
at
a
nestling
taken
from
a
hedge
in
april
of
course
alice
was
feeding
her
child
at
the
breast
if
abner
came
into
the
kitchen
in
the
middle
of
this
performance
she
would
turn
round
quickly
and
take
the
baby
upstairs
or
out
into
the
washhouse
blushing
abner
wondered
why
she
did
this
other
women
weren
t
so
sensitive
sometimes
he
would
pass
a
couple
of
them
standing
at
their
garden
gates
gossiping
and
feeding
their
babies
at
the
same
time
he
had
never
taken
any
notice
of
them
nobody
else
took
any
notice
of
them
there
was
something
in
alice
s
blushes
that
embarrassed
him
unreasonably
afterward
he
asked
himself
why
this
should
be
but
when
next
he
saw
alice
hiding
her
white
breast
he
blushed
himself
the
new
relation
was
very
curious
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
abner
s
profound
distrust
of
her
they
might
even
have
become
intimate
it
was
no
good
for
alice
to
pretend
that
she
wasn
t
lonely
in
spite
of
all
her
pride
in
being
a
married
woman
and
the
mother
of
a
family
s
beginning
she
couldn
t
conceal
the
fact
that
since
the
baby
s
birth
her
husband
took
very
little
notice
of
her
it
was
as
if
he
had
said
now
that
i
ve
done
my
duty
by
the
nation
and
given
you
something
to
play
with
you
can
just
attend
to
my
comforts
without
bothering
he
had
lately
transferred
his
custom
from
the
greyhound
to
the
lyttleton
arms
a
shorter
walk
at
closing
time
so
far
he
had
never
maltreated
alice
but
she
knew
very
well
that
she
couldn
t
now
play
him
the
tricks
that
had
pleased
him
in
their
courting
days
so
from
being
with
her
husband
like
a
little
girl
in
school
with
abner
she
behaved
like
a
schoolgirl
released
chattering
eager
and
friendly
it
puzzled
him
for
he
had
never
had
a
sister
and
didn
t
understand
the
creature
in
the
least
her
flatteries
and
sudden
kindnesses
surprised
him
every
bit
as
much
as
her
spurts
of
temper
in
each
case
she
seemed
equally
childish
particularly
on
days
when
she
had
been
too
busy
to
do
her
hair
and
wore
it
in
a
pigtail
at
the
back
then
there
was
another
alice
who
could
assert
with
something
very
near
to
dignity
the
fact
that
she
was
mistress
of
the
house
and
another
blushing
alice
before
whom
he
too
had
blushed
on
the
whole
however
her
most
obvious
feature
was
her
kindness
in
the
evening
when
abner
came
home
dirty
from
the
pit
he
would
find
the
waiting
for
him
and
tea
laid
ready
on
the
kitchen
table
alice
as
likely
as
not
would
be
bathing
the
baby
who
already
showed
a
native
sturdiness
in
spite
of
his
mother
s
indiscretions
while
abner
ate
his
tea
she
would
talk
to
the
baby
in
a
low
cooing
voice
which
she
was
evidently
convinced
would
fetch
him
from
time
to
time
in
the
middle
of
these
whispers
she
would
look
up
sideways
to
where
abner
sat
munching
bread
and
butter
with
the
sunlight
in
his
hair
abner
who
knew
that
he
was
and
was
now
a
little
conscious
of
his
manly
superiority
took
no
notice
of
her
and
yet
in
the
end
he
couldn
t
help
being
dragged
into
the
atmosphere
of
intimacy
which
her
small
attentions
created
grudgingly
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
she
had
changed
for
the
better
he
was
now
old
enough
to
be
flattered
too
they
became
almost
good
friends
and
only
abner
s
native
cautiousness
prevented
a
complete
reconciliation
alice
knew
this
she
knew
the
shy
spirit
with
which
she
had
to
deal
but
was
happy
to
feel
that
she
had
accomplished
so
much
already
somewhere
in
the
back
of
her
mind
she
suspected
that
a
time
might
come
in
which
she
would
rely
on
abner
s
strength
to
protect
her
and
her
baby
some
day
she
might
need
his
help
it
was
of
john
fellows
her
husband
that
she
was
afraid
this
new
relation
abner
thought
was
all
very
well
still
just
because
they
had
patched
up
their
old
quarrel
they
needn
t
necessarily
be
always
together
he
wasn
t
going
to
abandon
his
friend
joe
hodgetts
and
tiger
for
the
sake
of
feminine
small
talk
nor
did
he
mean
to
forsake
mrs
moseley
at
whose
house
the
dog
still
slept
those
early
autumn
evenings
were
great
times
for
tiger
abner
knew
of
a
dozen
fields
in
which
he
could
be
certain
of
putting
up
a
hare
it
annoyed
alice
to
see
him
so
eager
to
get
away
just
when
she
wanted
him
most
she
knew
that
he
went
in
to
see
mrs
moseley
she
told
herself
that
she
had
always
hated
the
old
woman
even
before
she
had
been
forced
on
her
by
her
husband
one
evening
when
abner
was
hurrying
away
after
tea
she
called
him
back
where
are
you
going
abner
down
you
m
going
to
mrs
moseley
and
why
shouldn
t
i
go
to
mrs
moseley
s
you
can
t
stop
me
stay
with
us
abner
she
coaxed
abner
only
laughed
at
her
then
she
flew
into
a
passion
standing
up
white
and
trembling
at
the
side
of
the
table
how
can
you
go
to
mrs
moseley
s
she
cried
who
s
mrs
moseley
i
should
like
to
know
you
re
all
cracked
on
your
mrs
moseley
you
and
your
father
that
fat
old
woman
in
her
nasty
smelly
house
and
you
didn
t
ought
to
leave
me
when
i
want
you
you
didn
t
ought
to
i
m
your
mother
oh
you
m
my
mother
are
you
abner
burst
into
a
laugh
that
s
bloody
funny
that
is
oh
you
and
your
swearing
she
cried
he
didn
t
wait
to
hear
any
more
when
he
was
gone
she
fell
down
on
her
knees
beside
the
table
and
sobbed
with
her
head
in
her
hands
a
frail
pathetic
figure
with
her
hair
in
curling
rags
her
sobs
woke
the
baby
whose
cradle
had
been
carefully
placed
in
a
draught
between
the
open
door
and
the
fireplace
oh
you
now
she
cried
rocking
the
cradle
roughly
she
might
easily
have
upset
it
then
suddenly
repenting
she
picked
up
her
son
tenderly
and
hugging
him
to
her
breast
buried
her
sobs
in
his
downy
face
the
fourth
chapter
as
the
autumn
hardened
into
an
iron
winter
abner
had
less
time
than
ever
to
spend
on
these
distractions
when
the
football
season
opened
he
began
to
play
for
the
little
club
named
halesby
swifts
from
which
mawne
united
usually
drew
its
recruits
technically
it
was
a
professional
club
but
the
gate
money
that
it
drew
from
its
adventures
in
pursuit
of
the
local
charity
cups
did
no
more
than
pay
for
the
boots
and
clothes
and
footballs
of
the
players
in
the
first
round
of
the
north
bromwich
hospital
cup
competition
the
swifts
had
the
good
luck
to
be
drawn
against
their
big
neighbours
mawne
united
on
the
mawne
ground
and
abner
playing
repeated
the
exploit
of
his
childhood
by
scoring
a
goal
against
the
goalkeeper
who
had
succeeded
the
celebrated
harper
it
was
an
elevating
moment
the
captain
and
others
of
the
swifts
came
running
up
to
abner
and
wrung
his
hand
all
mawne
and
halesby
on
the
touchline
waved
black
bowler
hats
under
the
flag
of
mawne
united
languidly
flying
from
its
staff
beside
the
royal
oak
a
great
moment
abner
did
not
see
his
father
standing
in
his
old
place
behind
the
mawne
goal
posts
with
his
hands
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
reefer
coat
and
his
eyes
sparkling
as
he
puffed
away
at
his
black
clay
pipe
that
was
how
john
fellows
showed
his
emotion
later
in
the
evening
he
showed
it
in
another
way
this
match
however
made
a
considerable
difference
in
john
fellows
s
attitude
it
gave
abner
a
standing
with
his
father
that
had
never
been
granted
to
him
before
nor
was
this
the
only
result
of
his
success
for
on
the
following
monday
mr
hudson
the
chief
clerk
in
mr
willis
s
works
at
mawne
and
secretary
of
the
united
an
irreproachable
expert
in
a
game
that
he
had
never
played
sent
up
a
message
to
the
pit
for
abner
and
on
tuesday
he
had
signed
on
for
the
senior
club
a
lad
like
you
growing
and
that
said
mr
hudson
didn
t
ought
to
be
working
in
the
pit
i
ll
speak
to
the
manager
and
if
you
ll
come
down
to
the
furnaces
next
monday
we
ll
see
what
sort
of
job
we
can
find
on
monday
morning
abner
walked
over
to
the
stour
valley
in
which
the
great
works
lay
angrily
seething
and
picked
his
way
through
the
gigantic
debris
of
the
iron
age
huge
discarded
boilers
brown
with
rust
of
tangled
metal
that
had
served
its
day
stacks
of
rails
purple
mountains
of
iron
ore
standing
ready
for
the
that
snored
like
dragons
in
their
sleep
and
made
the
air
around
them
quiver
with
hot
breath
over
a
network
of
rails
on
which
an
officious
that
the
head
of
the
firm
had
christened
lilian
in
honour
of
his
daughter
ran
to
and
fro
whistling
shrill
warnings
over
many
steam
pipes
snaky
tentacles
of
the
central
that
hissed
steam
from
their
leaky
joints
he
passed
to
the
office
that
mr
hudson
inhabited
on
the
steps
in
the
middle
of
his
path
stood
a
tall
pale
young
man
who
stared
out
over
the
works
as
though
some
vision
entranced
him
abner
wondering
what
he
was
looking
at
and
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
saw
nothing
unusual
he
knew
that
this
was
young
mr
willis
mr
edward
as
hudson
called
him
he
asked
abner
what
he
wanted
mr
hudson
you
ll
find
him
he
moved
out
of
the
way
still
apparently
in
the
toils
of
his
dream
and
abner
was
shown
into
mr
hudson
whom
he
found
sitting
at
a
desk
with
a
pencil
behind
either
ear
ah
here
you
are
said
mr
hudson
there
s
a
good
chap
and
took
him
straightway
to
one
of
the
foremen
an
old
butty
of
john
fellows
who
gave
him
an
indefinite
labouring
job
that
consisted
of
moving
metallic
rubbish
from
one
part
of
the
works
to
another
as
occasion
demanded
at
mawne
it
seemed
no
fragment
of
iron
was
ever
allowed
to
leave
the
works
as
long
as
there
was
a
foot
of
space
in
which
it
could
be
stored
abner
also
had
to
grease
the
wheels
of
a
little
line
of
that
blundered
up
and
down
the
hill
in
front
of
the
manager
s
house
between
the
furnaces
and
the
high
colliery
of
timbertree
this
is
work
for
an
old
man
not
for
a
strong
lad
like
you
the
foreman
grumbled
he
knew
that
there
was
always
work
above
ground
and
good
pay
at
mawne
for
a
promising
footballer
they
ll
fause
you
up
now
wait
till
your
footballing
s
over
he
said
wait
till
you
ve
broke
your
leg
and
then
you
ask
your
mr
hudson
for
a
job
like
this
and
see
what
he
ll
tell
you
but
abner
was
seventeen
and
had
no
thoughts
for
age
the
greatest
delight
of
all
was
that
he
now
breathed
the
air
of
the
open
sky
all
day
instead
of
the
darkness
of
the
pit
and
even
if
the
ecstasy
of
his
evening
s
relief
was
now
blunted
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
his
capacity
for
physical
enjoyment
beneath
the
caresses
of
air
and
light
his
physique
began
to
expand
he
took
a
delight
in
the
strict
training
that
the
mawne
united
directors
enforced
on
their
players
with
skipping
and
rubbing
and
sprinting
his
muscles
became
hard
and
supple
and
his
whole
body
marvellously
fit
football
became
his
whole
life
in
his
work
at
mawne
even
in
his
dreams
he
pondered
on
its
tactics
all
his
friends
were
players
absorbed
in
the
same
game
he
gained
confidence
and
skill
and
by
the
end
of
the
season
he
had
become
one
of
the
crowd
s
idols
followed
from
the
arena
by
a
trail
of
small
boys
and
patted
on
the
back
by
strangers
as
he
walked
home
after
a
match
in
his
muddy
clothes
the
girls
also
used
to
turn
and
look
at
him
with
bold
glances
but
his
life
was
far
too
full
in
those
days
for
him
to
worry
his
head
about
women
his
relation
with
alice
had
now
passed
its
first
emotional
stage
and
though
she
was
more
interested
in
him
than
she
had
ever
been
before
she
had
grown
to
understand
him
better
so
that
the
storms
which
had
made
life
at
hackett
s
cottages
so
intense
no
longer
occurred
she
washed
his
football
clothes
with
care
and
fed
him
regularly
and
well
as
indeed
she
should
have
done
for
he
was
now
earning
good
money
she
had
discovered
that
it
paid
her
best
not
to
worry
him
sometimes
a
fit
of
restlessness
would
make
him
say
that
he
must
change
his
lodging
but
although
he
often
grumbled
he
still
stayed
on
in
the
room
that
he
had
occupied
since
he
was
a
child
in
her
anxiety
to
please
him
she
even
offered
of
her
own
accord
to
have
the
dog
tiger
in
the
house
but
abner
only
stared
at
her
wondering
what
she
was
getting
at
and
laughed
still
jealous
of
the
poor
old
woman
he
said
of
course
she
was
still
jealous
of
mrs
moseley
she
couldn
t
help
being
jealous
but
though
she
denied
this
indignantly
and
even
tried
to
prove
her
goodwill
by
paying
several
awkward
visits
with
the
baby
to
mrs
moseley
s
bedroom
she
knew
very
well
that
the
old
woman
s
attractions
for
abner
were
the
very
least
that
she
had
to
fear
she
was
really
and
deeply
jealous
of
the
young
women
who
stared
at
him
on
the
football
field
or
in
the
stourton
road
she
knew
how
handsome
he
was
growing
realised
with
an
agony
that
was
not
wholly
maternal
that
sooner
or
later
he
was
bound
to
fall
in
love
and
that
was
a
calamity
which
somehow
she
felt
she
could
not
bear
little
by
little
john
fellows
was
becoming
less
important
to
her
all
her
life
seemed
more
and
more
centred
in
her
baby
and
in
abner
thinking
the
matter
over
she
decided
that
it
was
her
best
policy
to
encourage
him
in
his
friendship
for
the
old
woman
and
she
did
so
gradually
insidiously
so
that
abner
should
not
guess
what
she
was
doing
or
wonder
why
she
was
doing
it
abner
needed
no
encouragement
he
had
never
wavered
from
his
loyalty
and
now
more
than
ever
he
felt
that
he
owed
some
attention
to
his
old
friend
since
the
day
when
she
had
taken
to
her
bed
after
the
fortnight
s
work
at
hackett
s
cottages
she
had
never
recovered
sufficiently
to
resume
her
former
activities
sometimes
indeed
it
had
seemed
that
her
leg
was
on
the
point
of
healing
but
as
soon
as
she
crawled
downstairs
and
tried
to
go
about
her
business
it
broke
down
again
which
was
not
surprising
seeing
how
much
her
lying
in
bed
had
weakened
her
the
doctor
could
do
nothing
but
preach
patience
and
leave
her
in
the
hands
of
the
district
nurse
for
a
whole
year
she
struggled
along
on
the
pittance
that
the
relieving
officer
gave
her
but
at
last
the
disorder
of
the
cottage
became
so
overwhelming
that
the
nurse
took
the
law
into
her
own
hands
and
in
spite
of
all
mrs
moseley
s
protests
wrote
a
letter
to
the
nearest
of
the
old
woman
s
relatives
a
younger
sister
the
wife
of
a
north
bromwich
named
wade
in
answer
to
the
letter
mrs
wade
came
over
to
see
her
sister
dressed
as
for
a
funeral
in
black
sateen
being
rather
afraid
that
she
might
find
it
awkward
to
get
out
of
taking
mrs
moseley
home
with
her
the
sight
of
the
old
woman
s
helplessness
gave
her
a
distinct
feeling
of
relief
which
showed
itself
in
the
warmth
of
her
condolences
well
eliza
this
is
a
shame
isn
t
it
and
my
won
t
george
be
shocked
when
i
tell
him
to
think
of
your
never
aving
let
us
know
just
to
think
of
it
mrs
moseley
feebly
protested
that
it
wasn
t
her
fault
that
the
wades
had
been
told
even
now
i
don
t
want
to
be
a
trouble
to
people
she
said
mrs
wade
assured
her
that
she
wasn
t
anything
of
the
kind
george
he
says
to
me
now
florrie
you
mind
you
bring
eliza
hack
with
but
of
course
any
one
could
see
with
half
a
glance
that
that
s
impossible
like
you
are
we
could
have
made
you
that
comfortable
too
we
ave
a
lovely
little
ouse
what
with
the
money
george
is
picking
up
and
what
we
ve
by
the
time
of
the
evening
train
on
which
her
sister
had
promised
to
return
to
north
bromwich
mrs
moseley
was
heartily
sick
of
george
s
name
and
achievements
she
hadn
t
really
ever
known
her
sister
florrie
and
now
she
felt
that
in
spite
of
her
suave
manner
and
affectation
of
kindnesses
that
cost
nothing
she
had
really
come
to
spy
out
the
nakedness
of
the
land
to
check
the
value
of
her
sister
s
scanty
effects
to
reckon
just
how
much
lay
between
her
and
the
workhouse
and
all
the
time
mrs
moseley
was
in
a
fever
wondering
what
the
house
was
like
downstairs
whether
in
her
absence
dirt
had
accumulated
whether
tiger
had
made
the
washhouse
in
a
mess
indeed
when
mrs
wade
departed
she
crept
downstairs
to
see
for
herself
whatever
they
says
was
always
her
they
can
t
say
i
bain
t
clean
the
upshot
of
this
visit
was
revealed
to
abner
a
week
or
two
later
when
he
arrived
one
evening
to
find
the
faithless
tiger
playing
at
the
knee
of
a
stranger
a
girl
with
the
city
s
matte
complexion
hair
that
was
almost
black
with
a
gleam
of
copper
in
it
and
brown
eyes
that
your
dog
she
said
smiling
her
voice
was
low
abner
was
now
used
to
the
voices
of
alice
and
her
neighbours
he
had
never
heard
a
woman
speak
so
quietly
he
said
yes
and
she
with
the
utmost
told
him
that
tiger
was
a
beauty
it
wasn
t
strictly
true
but
it
gave
abner
a
flush
of
pleasure
for
he
loved
tiger
then
she
said
i
m
susan
wade
mother
sent
me
here
to
look
after
auntie
liza
for
a
week
or
as
a
matter
of
fact
mother
warned
by
a
snuffy
in
lower
sparkdale
that
susan
was
anæmic
and
needed
country
air
had
suddenly
felt
more
than
usually
generous
toward
her
sister
and
sent
susan
to
help
with
no
more
than
the
price
of
her
keep
afford
it
she
said
when
her
husband
questioned
her
about
mrs
moseley
s
ability
to
feed
another
mouth
afford
it
you
don
t
know
our
liza
she
was
always
the
quiet
one
of
the
family
and
a
saving
kind
too
i
know
well
enough
she
s
got
a
stocking
somewhere
mr
wade
was
not
in
the
habit
of
arguing
with
his
wife
and
mrs
moseley
when
susan
arrived
at
halesby
with
a
small
wicker
basket
containing
her
best
dress
and
a
bag
of
apples
with
mother
s
love
was
so
deeply
touched
that
when
she
kissed
her
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
you
ll
be
lonely
she
said
with
an
old
woman
like
i
shall
go
out
into
the
lanes
said
susan
mother
told
me
i
must
get
all
the
fresh
air
i
can
for
the
blood
you
that
put
the
matter
quite
plainly
mrs
moseley
assured
abner
that
susan
was
a
dear
sweet
child
and
such
a
little
woman
but
he
never
met
her
in
mrs
moseley
s
presence
for
the
old
lady
had
decided
against
the
impropriety
of
susan
and
himself
together
beholding
her
in
bed
awkward
at
first
he
found
in
a
little
while
that
she
wasn
t
as
formidable
as
he
imagined
though
all
his
triumphs
in
the
football
field
could
not
have
given
him
one
half
of
her
staggering
what
impressed
him
most
about
her
was
without
doubt
the
sense
of
personal
cleanliness
that
she
carried
with
her
susan
was
on
a
holiday
and
had
time
for
such
refinements
she
wore
clean
print
dresses
while
alice
and
her
neighbours
in
hackett
s
cottages
by
whose
appearance
abner
had
regulated
his
ideas
of
feminine
nicety
wore
as
a
rule
the
livery
of
their
toil
susan
on
the
other
hand
lived
like
a
lady
having
no
better
work
for
her
fingers
than
the
braiding
of
her
dark
hair
in
the
mornings
she
stayed
with
mrs
moseley
listening
in
a
kind
of
dream
to
her
aunt
s
recitation
of
the
virtues
of
people
whom
in
the
days
before
her
marriage
she
had
served
it
seemed
as
if
that
were
the
time
in
her
life
toward
which
her
thoughts
now
returned
most
happily
and
the
mere
scraping
together
of
its
unimportant
details
filled
her
with
a
mild
afterglow
of
enjoyment
i
remember
she
would
begin
in
a
weak
contented
voice
that
was
soothing
in
its
tiredness
i
remember
one
day
mrs
first
mrs
willis
that
is
old
mr
hackett
s
daughter
down
the
holloway
and
mr
edward
s
remember
her
coming
into
the
kitchen
with
a
beautiful
basketful
of
cherries
fine
black
fruit
they
was
and
she
says
hannah
s
the
hannah
that
s
still
there
but
i
expect
she
s
forgotten
hannah
she
says
look
what
the
master
s
sent
from
the
they
always
call
it
the
you
know
up
above
mawne
bank
and
that
was
a
wonderful
year
for
cherries
we
ll
make
them
into
jam
hannah
she
says
and
liza
s
will
help
you
stone
she
says
and
how
we
laughed
to
be
sure
i
can
see
her
standing
there
now
a
bit
red
in
the
face
for
she
was
new
to
housekeeping
and
never
knew
you
don
t
stone
cherries
she
had
a
couple
of
in
her
lips
like
the
game
you
play
a
dear
lady
she
was
i
can
see
her
again
in
mr
edward
time
passes
doesn
t
it
you
ll
know
that
some
day
susan
tossed
her
head
perhaps
some
day
she
would
know
but
sufficient
unto
this
were
its
quiet
languors
and
the
breath
of
summer
air
drifting
in
at
a
chink
in
her
aunt
s
window
from
the
fields
towards
the
hills
she
herself
had
grown
up
in
the
cramped
quarter
of
sparkdale
where
in
the
pavements
burn
under
a
pale
sky
where
there
is
always
a
smell
of
dust
and
fire
and
rotting
remnants
of
fruit
dropped
from
the
hawkers
barrows
into
the
gutter
at
the
back
of
their
house
in
sparkdale
lay
a
little
garden
plot
but
her
father
had
always
given
it
over
to
fowls
that
made
it
an
arid
gritty
patch
littered
with
shed
feathers
all
the
parks
lay
miles
away
over
the
streets
and
the
only
green
that
susan
knew
was
the
grass
that
grew
within
the
railings
of
an
ugly
georgian
church
standing
in
a
square
that
had
once
been
fashionable
but
was
now
neglected
and
unkempt
for
this
reason
the
sloping
fields
beyond
halesby
were
wonderful
to
her
and
things
that
would
have
seemed
common
to
a
country
child
enchanting
in
the
afternoon
she
went
out
walking
with
tiger
there
was
no
need
for
abner
to
be
jealous
for
these
walks
bore
no
comparison
in
tiger
s
mind
with
his
evening
visits
to
banks
susan
had
come
to
halesby
thrilled
by
her
first
experience
of
romance
she
had
been
initiated
by
a
pale
young
clerk
named
bagley
who
taught
in
the
of
the
decayed
georgian
church
it
had
happened
at
their
annual
outing
to
sutton
park
there
in
a
hot
slade
of
larches
mr
bagley
had
held
her
hand
a
small
and
very
sticky
hand
in
a
lace
mitten
while
he
did
so
he
had
confided
to
her
that
his
was
an
extremely
passionate
nature
and
that
nothing
but
his
hold
on
the
anglican
faith
restrained
him
from
exploiting
it
and
after
this
immediately
before
tea
he
had
kissed
her
once
that
had
been
all
for
after
tea
mr
bagley
weighed
down
no
doubt
by
a
sense
of
shame
had
avoided
her
all
that
remained
to
her
of
this
adventure
was
the
power
of
making
mr
bagley
blush
and
this
was
no
very
signal
achievement
for
mr
bagley
flushed
easily
and
had
already
written
privily
to
advertisers
in
the
weekly
papers
who
claimed
to
cure
this
weakness
it
appeared
indeed
that
there
would
never
be
any
more
between
them
than
a
bond
of
secret
guilt
and
since
susan
had
liked
being
kissed
even
by
mr
bagley
she
decided
to
continue
her
experiments
whenever
the
chance
came
from
the
first
sight
of
him
abner
had
pleased
her
he
was
eighteen
just
a
year
older
than
herself
his
handsome
head
his
excellent
teeth
his
contrasting
fairness
the
size
and
strength
of
his
body
all
attracted
her
she
thought
she
would
like
to
be
alone
with
him
and
see
what
would
happen
therefore
she
began
by
inviting
herself
to
accompany
him
on
one
of
his
evening
excursions
with
tiger
abner
resented
the
proposal
partly
because
he
had
never
quite
shaken
off
the
convention
of
his
boyhood
that
girls
were
soft
and
any
dealings
with
them
shameful
and
partly
because
he
was
jealous
of
any
stranger
invading
a
world
that
was
so
particularly
his
own
and
so
specially
guarded
from
the
feminine
influence
hitherto
represented
by
alice
but
susan
by
her
quiet
determination
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
refuse
she
had
always
the
father
s
principal
pet
and
when
abner
put
her
off
she
simply
declined
to
believe
that
he
meant
it
he
grumbled
and
submitted
he
supposed
that
he
was
doing
a
kindness
to
mrs
moseley
by
taking
her
and
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
that
after
all
susan
wasn
t
like
other
girls
a
conclusion
at
which
he
arrived
without
difficulty
seeing
that
he
had
known
no
other
girl
but
alice
on
his
side
indeed
the
relationship
was
as
natural
as
it
might
be
it
was
susan
who
found
it
rather
a
failure
in
the
absence
of
sentimental
developments
abner
treated
her
she
found
very
much
as
if
she
had
been
a
boy
and
though
this
was
the
pose
with
which
she
had
started
their
acquaintance
she
didn
t
want
it
to
remain
at
that
mrs
moseley
s
in
which
she
could
see
herself
when
she
sat
in
her
favourite
place
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
in
the
morning
assured
her
that
she
was
much
nicer
to
look
at
now
than
when
she
first
came
to
halesby
from
the
city
she
was
plumper
her
cheeks
and
lips
were
more
brightly
coloured
and
her
eyes
clearer
mr
bagley
would
have
noticed
the
difference
abner
apparently
didn
t
she
comforted
herself
with
the
reflection
that
he
was
too
rough
and
rugged
to
realise
her
delicacy
that
he
was
only
a
common
labourer
and
no
fit
associate
for
a
foreman
s
daughter
but
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
her
social
quality
should
really
have
made
her
more
attractive
to
him
she
was
a
very
direct
young
woman
one
evening
when
they
went
out
for
their
walk
down
the
lane
that
leads
to
the
woody
basin
known
as
dovehouse
fields
they
came
to
a
lonely
stile
at
the
end
of
a
bridge
over
a
tributary
of
the
stour
beyond
which
the
red
bank
was
tunnelled
by
many
rabbits
tiger
ran
forward
eagerly
over
the
bridge
and
began
to
sniff
at
the
holes
in
the
bank
and
abner
would
have
followed
him
if
susan
had
not
barred
the
way
sitting
complacently
on
the
top
of
the
stile
she
sat
there
in
the
low
sunlight
that
warmed
her
cheeks
lighted
gleams
of
copper
in
her
hair
and
made
her
brown
eyes
amber
i
want
to
stay
here
abner
she
said
well
let
us
pass
then
said
abner
thinking
only
of
rabbits
wait
till
i
come
but
she
wouldn
t
move
from
her
perch
she
sat
there
smiling
and
swinging
her
long
legs
tiger
who
couldn
t
realise
why
any
scentless
human
should
hesitate
on
the
verge
of
such
excitements
ran
back
and
looked
at
them
making
little
quick
noises
of
encouragement
susan
called
him
and
rather
reluctantly
he
scuttled
back
over
the
bridge
and
jumped
up
to
her
knees
licking
her
hands
she
said
don
t
you
think
i
look
nice
abner
i
don
t
see
nothing
wrong
with
you
said
abner
without
enthusiasm
don
t
be
soft
she
said
i
mean
don
t
you
want
to
kiss
me
he
didn
t
he
hadn
t
thought
about
such
a
thing
it
was
she
who
was
being
soft
now
and
yet
he
couldn
t
help
wanting
to
try
when
he
saw
her
smiling
at
him
from
the
stile
he
kissed
her
very
clumsily
on
the
cheek
he
had
never
kissed
any
one
before
and
its
softness
and
coolness
bewildered
him
but
she
wasn
t
content
with
this
she
took
his
face
in
both
her
hands
and
kissed
his
lips
he
lost
his
head
he
didn
t
know
what
he
was
doing
he
took
her
in
his
arms
in
a
way
that
was
very
different
from
mr
bagley
s
passionate
embrace
it
seemed
as
if
he
wanted
to
kiss
the
life
out
of
her
she
drew
back
almost
frightened
of
him
but
he
wouldn
t
let
her
go
they
left
tiger
to
his
rabbits
and
wandered
off
into
the
woods
when
susan
returned
in
the
darkness
mrs
moseley
could
not
help
remarking
how
well
she
looked
this
was
no
more
than
the
beginning
of
the
adventure
there
was
nothing
lukewarm
about
the
passion
that
susan
had
thus
precipitated
her
education
which
had
brought
her
very
nearly
to
the
level
of
prudishness
had
not
prepared
her
for
abner
s
mr
bagley
she
reflected
would
have
made
her
timid
presents
of
sweets
and
perhaps
occupied
the
pew
behind
hers
in
church
he
would
have
taken
her
for
walks
in
one
of
the
decorous
parks
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
he
would
have
held
her
hand
on
the
tram
and
paid
her
spoony
compliments
abner
paid
her
no
compliments
gave
her
no
presents
nor
did
he
hold
her
hand
he
held
her
whole
body
till
she
felt
that
her
will
was
failing
and
that
her
only
duty
was
to
obey
him
she
was
terrified
by
his
violence
ashamed
of
responding
to
its
crudity
she
was
almost
sorry
that
she
had
provoked
him
for
now
it
was
she
who
fled
from
him
and
feared
to
be
overtaken
and
though
the
excitement
of
the
chase
thrilled
her
she
could
never
escape
from
the
vague
threat
of
its
inevitable
end
her
mother
she
knew
would
have
approved
of
mr
bagley
what
would
she
think
of
this
handsome
young
labourer
this
professional
footballer
she
knew
that
she
was
bound
to
resist
him
as
long
as
she
could
this
was
no
easy
matter
abner
absorbed
her
gave
her
no
chance
once
having
got
her
he
would
not
let
her
go
her
calculations
of
the
future
didn
t
trouble
him
every
evening
when
he
had
knocked
off
work
he
came
along
to
mrs
moseley
s
house
and
called
for
her
and
in
spite
of
any
excuse
that
she
might
make
he
took
her
off
over
the
fields
and
into
the
woods
mrs
moseley
unconsciously
abetted
him
your
mother
s
anxious
that
you
should
get
all
the
fresh
air
you
can
dear
she
used
to
say
and
it
s
a
beautiful
evening
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
the
old
woman
was
sure
that
she
could
trust
them
together
and
for
three
weeks
of
brilliant
summer
weather
they
spent
the
evening
and
the
twilight
in
each
other
s
arms
susan
tried
a
series
of
tactics
that
she
invented
for
her
own
protection
she
pretended
to
shrink
from
his
coarseness
and
from
the
dirt
of
the
works
in
contrast
with
her
own
clean
fragility
she
adopted
another
distant
attitude
proprietary
and
maternal
abner
laughed
at
both
of
them
she
even
in
an
extremity
played
her
last
card
the
attentions
of
the
elegant
bagley
you
give
him
five
minutes
alone
with
me
and
i
ll
settle
that
said
abner
you
re
my
wench
and
don
t
you
forget
it
providence
in
the
shape
of
a
calamity
saved
her
her
mother
sprained
an
ankle
in
the
and
wired
for
susan
to
return
to
north
bromwich
at
once
the
telegram
came
while
abner
was
at
work
and
when
he
reached
mrs
moseley
s
cottage
in
the
evening
susan
was
gone
she
left
a
carefully
written
note
behind
her
in
which
she
addressed
him
as
mr
fellows
and
said
that
she
hoped
he
would
always
think
of
her
as
kindly
as
she
did
of
him
she
said
it
would
be
nice
to
get
back
to
north
bromwich
after
so
long
in
the
country
but
carefully
omitted
to
supply
him
with
her
address
at
first
abner
was
stunned
then
angry
he
couldn
t
put
up
with
mrs
moseley
s
mild
meanderings
he
hadn
t
the
heart
to
go
out
into
the
desecrated
woods
when
tiger
leapt
at
him
in
anticipation
of
a
walk
he
kicked
the
dog
in
the
ribs
the
football
season
would
not
begin
for
another
month
and
since
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
returned
to
hackett
s
cottages
alice
who
had
kept
an
eye
full
of
jealous
suspicions
on
him
for
the
last
month
received
him
she
saw
that
something
had
bowled
him
over
it
gave
her
a
secret
satisfaction
early
abner
she
said
he
would
not
answer
her
whatever
s
up
with
you
she
said
you
m
all
and
then
with
a
laugh
she
answered
her
own
question
by
another
too
much
sweethearting
in
a
tone
that
pretended
to
be
merely
bantering
but
in
reality
carried
a
sting
he
knew
that
faint
touch
of
malice
in
her
so
well
that
it
made
him
flare
up
at
once
with
i
don
t
want
no
bloody
it
didn
t
strike
him
that
her
malice
might
be
taken
as
a
compliment
and
when
she
laughed
at
his
reply
he
walked
out
of
the
house
in
a
temper
he
didn
t
know
where
to
go
but
taking
his
father
s
example
he
wandered
down
to
the
royal
oak
where
he
sat
drinking
pint
after
pint
with
one
of
his
football
friends
and
a
couple
of
women
at
closing
time
the
whole
party
were
turned
out
together
and
walked
down
into
halesby
it
was
nearly
daybreak
when
he
returned
to
hackett
s
cottages
still
the
worse
for
liquor
and
blundered
upstairs
to
bed
he
slept
so
heavily
that
he
did
not
hear
the
mawne
bull
in
the
morning
at
ten
o
clock
a
feeling
that
some
one
was
in
the
room
aroused
him
he
opened
his
eyes
to
a
blinding
light
and
saw
that
alice
had
placed
a
cup
of
hot
tea
at
his
bedside
he
drank
it
so
eagerly
that
he
scalded
his
mouth
the
fifth
chapter
this
sudden
outburst
was
sufficiently
violent
to
satisfy
abner
that
for
the
present
he
could
do
without
liquor
or
women
it
wasn
t
very
difficult
to
forget
susan
for
she
had
really
been
more
trouble
than
she
was
worth
the
affair
would
never
have
begun
but
for
her
provocation
and
since
she
hadn
t
the
pluck
to
go
through
with
it
abner
satisfied
himself
by
exaggerating
her
insipidity
in
his
own
mind
after
the
first
sting
of
malice
with
which
she
had
sent
him
off
on
the
drink
alice
showed
her
repentance
first
symbolised
by
the
waiting
cup
of
tea
in
a
hundred
attentions
and
kindnesses
he
never
told
her
about
his
affair
with
susan
but
she
appeared
to
understand
more
or
less
what
had
happened
and
even
to
sympathise
with
him
in
his
violent
methods
of
getting
over
it
she
made
him
so
comfortable
at
hackett
s
cottages
that
there
was
no
more
talk
of
his
finding
other
lodgings
in
the
early
days
of
her
married
life
the
responsibilities
of
the
house
and
its
two
male
inhabitants
had
been
too
much
for
her
inexperience
and
the
coming
of
the
baby
in
the
first
year
had
made
her
abandon
all
attempts
to
keep
pace
with
domestic
demands
in
the
second
year
she
regained
her
strength
and
a
great
deal
of
the
physical
charm
that
had
originally
attracted
john
fellows
the
baby
a
normal
healthy
child
had
also
prospered
and
now
that
he
was
weaned
slept
away
most
of
the
day
on
his
mother
s
bed
upstairs
or
in
his
cradle
in
the
kitchen
nothing
marred
the
smoothness
of
domestic
life
at
number
eleven
but
the
uncertainty
of
john
fellows
s
temper
and
his
periodical
bouts
of
drinking
and
even
in
these
emergencies
alice
s
increasing
knowledge
of
life
and
her
absorption
in
the
care
of
abner
and
her
baby
sustained
her
the
strangest
part
of
the
whole
business
was
that
abner
and
his
father
never
fell
foul
of
one
another
since
that
one
dangerous
moment
on
the
morning
of
the
baby
s
birth
there
had
never
been
any
danger
of
this
it
was
as
if
they
had
agreed
to
go
on
their
own
ways
abner
kept
clear
of
his
father
because
his
natural
love
of
peace
and
increasing
concern
for
the
convenience
of
alice
made
him
anxious
to
avoid
a
quarrel
and
john
fellows
condoned
his
son
s
unreasonable
abstinence
from
liquor
on
the
grounds
of
his
success
in
the
football
field
although
he
never
said
so
he
was
proud
of
abner
s
prowess
gathering
indeed
a
little
reflected
glory
from
it
among
his
mates
at
the
pit
and
his
boon
companions
at
the
pub
it
was
fortunate
for
alice
that
her
family
was
so
small
for
it
meant
not
only
that
she
was
unburdened
with
housework
but
also
that
the
question
of
money
never
troubled
her
john
fellows
never
did
anything
by
halves
he
worked
as
hard
as
he
drank
and
since
all
colliers
are
paid
by
piecework
he
earned
enough
to
keep
the
house
going
and
himself
in
liquor
abner
also
was
well
paid
for
the
work
he
did
at
mawne
and
in
addition
to
this
received
a
pound
a
week
from
the
united
football
club
during
the
season
out
of
these
earnings
he
paid
alice
eighteen
shillings
for
his
board
and
keep
and
this
together
with
her
husband
s
weekly
allowance
enabled
her
to
make
the
house
exactly
what
she
wanted
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
this
happy
state
of
affairs
should
not
go
on
for
ever
or
at
any
rate
until
abner
found
some
other
wretched
girl
who
took
his
fancy
this
was
the
event
that
alice
dreaded
most
and
for
the
present
abner
s
life
was
too
full
of
work
and
training
to
make
it
probable
they
spent
most
of
their
evenings
together
while
john
fellows
was
down
at
the
royal
oak
and
the
baby
placidly
sleeping
in
its
cradle
they
were
the
happiest
of
alice
s
life
for
they
realised
all
her
ideals
of
what
domesticity
should
be
the
little
room
was
cheerful
with
firelight
and
always
warm
for
john
fellows
had
the
privilege
of
buying
coal
for
next
to
nothing
at
the
pit
on
the
table
she
used
to
spread
a
cloth
of
bright
red
chequers
a
lamp
in
the
middle
of
it
cast
a
mild
and
homely
light
alice
would
sit
on
one
side
of
the
fire
knitting
woollen
vests
for
the
baby
or
mending
the
men
s
clothes
she
sat
in
her
rocking
chair
enthroned
with
content
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
the
sleeping
baby
at
the
shining
brass
on
which
she
particularly
prided
herself
at
all
the
tokens
of
comfort
with
which
she
was
surrounded
the
door
of
number
eleven
was
or
warped
with
age
so
that
a
draught
blew
in
beneath
it
towards
the
fire
but
abner
had
arranged
a
curtain
of
red
rep
on
a
running
string
above
it
so
that
the
draught
was
not
felt
and
the
swaying
of
the
curtain
only
emphasised
the
contrast
between
the
winter
without
and
that
glowing
cosiness
within
all
these
things
that
surrounded
her
were
her
own
her
world
she
would
not
have
changed
one
of
them
the
glances
that
she
gave
to
them
were
proprietary
and
richly
satisfied
sometimes
in
the
same
way
she
would
let
her
eyes
fall
on
abner
a
big
fellow
over
six
feet
high
with
the
closely
cropped
hair
of
the
footballer
and
a
yellow
moustache
in
the
evenings
at
home
he
wore
no
collar
and
the
firelight
played
on
his
powerful
neck
and
lit
the
fair
down
on
his
arm
when
he
sat
in
his
shirtsleeves
even
with
him
her
glance
was
proprietary
he
also
belonged
to
her
and
she
mended
his
clothes
with
the
same
delight
and
devotion
that
she
experienced
in
making
the
ridiculous
garments
of
her
son
she
rejoiced
in
his
beauty
and
in
his
strength
perhaps
sometimes
the
physical
comparison
that
he
suggested
with
john
fellows
made
her
admiration
more
poignant
usually
these
long
evenings
were
lonely
at
times
however
alice
s
father
the
timekeeper
at
mawne
would
come
stumping
up
on
his
wooden
leg
and
take
a
seat
before
the
fire
between
them
he
was
very
fond
of
alice
he
would
pinch
her
cheek
and
hold
her
arm
and
make
her
blush
by
asking
every
time
he
came
when
she
was
going
to
give
him
another
grandson
he
was
a
poor
old
man
his
pay
like
most
pensions
was
inadequate
and
the
cottage
on
the
edge
of
the
works
which
the
company
allowed
him
was
old
and
so
damp
that
he
suffered
from
rheumatism
particularly
as
he
always
said
with
a
chuckle
in
the
leg
that
he
had
lost
here
alice
s
younger
sister
elsie
kept
house
for
him
she
had
never
been
a
favourite
of
his
and
was
a
bad
manager
she
and
her
sister
who
had
always
quarrelled
before
alice
s
marriage
were
now
for
reasons
which
alice
attributed
to
jealousy
no
longer
on
speaking
terms
mr
higgins
always
tried
to
gloss
this
unfortunate
circumstance
with
one
of
his
little
jokes
when
i
come
up
here
he
said
abner
ought
to
go
and
keep
our
elsie
abner
would
laugh
but
alice
glanced
sharply
at
him
she
hated
to
hear
any
woman
s
name
mentioned
in
connection
with
his
and
most
of
all
her
sister
s
but
mr
higgins
unaware
of
these
fine
shades
of
feeling
constantly
pursued
the
project
now
if
abner
here
went
and
married
our
elsie
what
a
queer
kettle
of
fish
it
would
be
to
be
sure
which
would
you
be
his
mother
or
his
both
on
em
likewise
elsie
d
be
your
and
your
sister
and
if
our
elsie
was
abner
s
aunt
she
d
be
the
of
her
own
babbies
surely
oh
don
t
go
on
so
dad
said
alice
sharply
do
give
over
you
can
say
what
you
like
alice
said
mr
higgins
but
that
s
a
knot
it
d
take
more
than
a
parson
to
get
at
nine
the
old
man
would
leave
them
with
another
of
his
little
jokes
abner
would
see
him
out
and
then
yawning
stretch
his
legs
and
say
that
it
was
time
he
was
turning
in
he
used
to
ask
alice
before
he
went
upstairs
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
for
her
it
was
only
a
formula
but
the
words
always
gave
her
a
flush
of
pleasure
when
he
was
gone
upstairs
she
would
busy
herself
with
preparing
his
can
of
tea
and
bacon
sandwiches
to
take
to
the
works
next
day
then
she
would
settle
down
again
in
her
chair
at
the
fireside
and
sit
with
her
work
in
her
lap
dreaming
and
waiting
for
the
unsteady
deliberate
step
of
her
husband
on
the
path
this
was
the
worst
moment
of
her
day
john
fellows
rarely
returned
home
until
half
an
hour
after
closing
time
and
for
this
reason
it
was
seldom
that
he
saw
abner
off
the
football
field
at
home
he
never
approached
him
except
with
the
hope
of
extracting
inside
information
as
to
the
probable
results
of
the
league
matches
on
which
he
proposed
to
bet
and
in
this
he
found
abner
unsympathetic
for
although
league
football
had
not
sunk
in
those
days
to
its
present
depths
of
unabashed
commercialism
abner
knew
that
the
result
of
a
match
was
sometimes
decided
in
accordance
with
the
bookmaker
s
instructions
john
fellows
never
backed
horses
for
he
regarded
the
turf
as
a
resort
of
crooks
and
sharks
he
put
his
money
on
dogs
and
football
teams
and
even
if
he
lost
it
he
had
at
any
rate
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
it
lost
with
his
own
eyes
he
didn
t
mind
losing
money
as
long
as
he
had
a
run
for
it
according
to
his
lights
he
was
a
sportsman
the
football
season
had
opened
with
a
flourish
as
far
as
mawne
united
were
concerned
in
the
north
bromwich
league
they
had
beaten
all
their
principal
rivals
wolverbury
dulston
and
even
the
albion
reserves
now
in
the
of
the
midland
cup
they
were
to
meet
the
albion
again
the
members
of
the
team
became
more
than
ever
popular
heroes
and
abner
down
at
the
works
was
conscious
of
his
share
in
the
distinction
the
winter
had
set
in
early
with
a
november
of
black
frost
that
made
the
with
which
he
was
still
engaged
under
the
same
grumbling
foreman
harder
and
more
icy
to
the
touch
and
congealed
the
grease
in
the
running
of
the
trolley
railway
it
was
some
compensation
that
the
blast
furnaces
which
were
surrounded
in
summer
by
a
zone
of
air
undulant
with
intolerable
heat
now
gave
a
sense
of
neighbourly
warmth
to
the
centre
of
the
works
abner
who
knew
that
his
position
was
more
secure
than
ever
managed
to
spend
most
of
his
day
near
these
black
towers
talking
football
to
the
men
who
were
engaged
in
making
the
moulds
of
sand
into
which
the
molten
metal
would
flow
when
the
furnaces
were
tapped
it
was
an
idle
and
a
pleasant
life
but
he
enjoyed
it
knowing
as
did
every
one
else
in
the
works
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
preparation
for
the
sterner
business
of
saturdays
one
wednesday
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
was
at
work
loading
some
pigs
of
iron
into
a
truck
that
stood
waiting
on
the
siding
near
the
furnace
it
was
good
warm
work
for
a
winter
s
day
and
abner
had
thrown
off
his
coat
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
unfastened
the
neck
of
his
shirt
he
and
his
mate
had
just
hoisted
the
last
of
the
pigs
into
the
truck
when
the
furnace
foreman
gave
the
signal
for
the
tapping
of
the
nearest
tower
abner
watched
the
proceeding
as
he
put
on
his
coat
and
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
the
men
stripped
to
the
waist
approached
the
vent
of
the
furnace
carrying
a
heavy
crowbar
with
which
they
loosened
the
plug
of
fireclay
which
kept
the
contents
of
the
furnace
from
escaping
they
leapt
aside
as
the
first
stream
of
molten
mineral
gushed
out
the
foreman
watched
them
shading
his
eyes
from
the
heat
the
fluid
that
came
first
was
the
dross
of
the
ore
which
had
sunk
to
the
bottom
of
the
furnace
and
this
was
diverted
so
that
it
flowed
into
a
wide
pan
where
it
would
cool
into
a
cake
of
brittle
iridescent
slag
a
moment
later
pure
iron
began
to
flow
the
puddlers
closed
the
entrance
to
the
pool
of
slag
and
molten
metal
crept
with
the
slow
persistence
of
a
down
the
central
channel
and
into
the
moulds
of
sand
that
were
ready
to
receive
it
the
damp
air
above
the
beds
first
steamed
then
swam
with
heat
not
molten
gold
could
have
seemed
more
beautiful
than
this
harsh
intractable
metal
it
ran
into
the
moulds
sluggishly
and
with
a
soft
hissing
sound
some
one
tapped
abner
on
the
shoulder
and
drew
him
aside
it
was
mr
hudson
who
had
walked
down
delicately
from
the
office
so
delicately
that
he
had
not
even
disturbed
the
two
pencils
wedged
above
his
ears
he
shivered
slightly
for
he
had
been
shut
up
all
day
with
a
coke
stove
drawing
abner
aside
behind
the
line
of
trucks
he
began
to
talk
to
him
about
the
with
the
albion
with
the
utmost
friendliness
he
discussed
the
prospects
of
mawne
united
in
the
match
which
was
now
only
ten
days
ahead
abner
answered
him
respectfully
mr
hudson
had
not
only
given
him
his
present
comfortable
job
but
also
carried
in
his
pocket
the
future
of
every
man
employed
in
the
works
for
mr
willis
whose
eager
mind
was
always
set
on
expansions
of
the
monster
that
he
had
created
out
of
the
fortune
which
his
had
made
in
the
war
was
far
too
busy
to
worry
his
head
about
such
details
so
you
think
we
ll
win
said
mr
hudson
fingering
the
bronze
cross
on
his
it
bain
t
no
good
playing
any
match
if
you
don
t
think
you
ll
win
said
abner
mr
hudson
stroked
his
red
moustache
i
may
say
that
the
albion
has
offered
us
a
hundred
pounds
to
play
the
match
at
north
bromwich
on
their
ground
the
club
could
do
with
the
don
t
you
take
it
abner
replied
don
t
you
take
it
the
mawne
ground
s
worth
a
couple
of
goals
to
our
chaps
in
a
match
of
that
kind
that
slope
down
by
the
royal
oak
puzzled
the
albion
last
time
our
forwards
know
how
to
use
the
albion
s
particular
anxious
to
win
said
hudson
what
s
more
the
bookmakers
are
giving
three
to
one
against
mawne
that
shows
you
which
way
the
wind
s
well
i
hope
to
god
it
busts
them
said
abner
i
m
no
friend
to
football
mr
hudson
blenched
at
this
loose
employment
of
the
deity
s
name
he
took
abner
by
the
arm
look
here
he
said
speaking
in
the
strictest
confidence
i
can
tell
you
that
the
club
will
accept
albion
s
offer
to
play
at
north
bromwich
what
s
more
if
albion
win
i
can
safely
say
it
will
be
worth
ten
pounds
to
you
abner
shook
himself
free
from
mr
hudson
s
friendly
arm
if
he
had
followed
the
inclination
of
the
moment
he
would
have
laid
mr
hudson
flat
there
and
then
on
the
cinders
his
feelings
had
passed
beyond
the
stage
of
words
but
while
he
stood
glaring
at
mr
hudson
s
face
now
weakly
smiling
and
white
with
fear
he
saw
something
else
that
stopped
him
the
figure
of
a
woman
running
towards
them
as
fast
as
she
could
over
the
cumbered
ground
of
the
works
she
was
hatless
and
had
a
shawl
thrown
round
her
shoulders
he
knew
even
at
a
distance
that
it
was
alice
she
ran
straight
up
to
abner
with
her
hair
blown
loose
and
with
a
flush
of
excitement
that
made
her
singularly
beautiful
mr
hudson
snatched
at
the
opportunity
for
retreat
this
lady
wants
you
he
said
abner
still
under
the
influence
of
a
divided
emotion
took
a
step
in
his
direction
but
alice
pulled
at
his
sleeve
the
tears
that
she
had
been
restraining
as
she
ran
overcame
her
and
she
could
only
cry
abner
abner
what
the
hell
s
up
with
he
said
roughly
your
father
abner
she
sobbed
it
s
your
what
s
that
what
s
he
done
it
s
an
accident
at
the
pit
father
sent
up
elsie
with
the
you
mean
he
s
dead
said
abner
suddenly
sobered
no
not
dead
i
don
t
think
so
it
s
an
accident
some
kind
of
accident
elsie
was
that
moithered
she
couldn
t
say
proper
so
i
left
her
there
and
ran
off
for
you
i
couldn
t
take
him
in
myself
i
couldn
t
think
of
nowt
but
running
for
nell
if
he
bain
t
dead
what
the
hell
s
the
matter
said
abner
practically
they
left
the
works
together
alice
still
out
of
breath
could
scarcely
keep
pace
with
abner
s
long
strides
but
now
her
nervous
sobbing
had
ceased
and
she
even
smiled
at
the
corner
of
hackett
s
cottages
they
met
the
procession
from
the
colliery
for
some
obscure
reason
alice
s
father
had
lost
the
key
of
the
store
in
which
the
stretchers
were
kept
and
so
they
carried
john
fellows
home
on
a
door
in
his
progress
from
the
pit
they
had
fallen
in
with
a
stream
of
children
suddenly
disgorged
from
the
ragged
schools
and
a
train
of
these
had
swollen
the
curious
to
find
out
who
or
what
lay
under
the
brown
blanket
all
the
women
of
hackett
s
cottages
gathered
at
the
gateway
of
number
eleven
to
receive
him
many
of
them
carrying
babies
and
offering
haphazard
advice
in
the
intervals
of
giving
them
refreshment
the
doorway
of
the
house
was
too
small
to
admit
the
improvised
stretcher
so
they
laid
it
down
at
the
side
of
the
garden
be
careful
of
my
bloody
tomatters
john
fellows
growled
it
was
the
first
sign
of
life
he
had
given
abner
and
two
others
lifted
him
from
the
door
and
carried
him
through
the
kitchen
and
up
the
twisting
stairs
the
boards
creaked
under
their
weight
as
though
they
were
on
the
point
of
splintering
it
was
his
right
thigh
that
had
been
broken
and
once
on
the
journey
upstairs
they
jolted
him
so
much
that
he
unclenched
his
teeth
and
roared
like
a
bull
the
crowd
in
the
roadway
shuddered
this
was
their
first
considerable
sensation
they
laid
him
on
the
bed
alice
now
very
pale
and
composed
followed
them
upstairs
with
a
cup
of
tea
god
if
i
m
come
to
tea
drinking
it
s
a
gonner
said
john
fellows
send
out
for
a
spot
of
brandy
a
small
boy
was
sent
running
to
the
lyttleton
arms
elsie
had
already
gone
for
the
doctor
the
news
had
spread
quickly
in
various
forms
and
all
halesby
heard
with
sensation
that
john
fellows
had
had
his
skull
smashed
in
mawne
pit
the
brandy
came
he
wouldn
t
have
it
spoiled
with
water
and
swallowed
it
neat
but
even
the
brandy
could
not
alter
the
ashen
pallor
of
his
face
beneath
its
coating
of
coal
dust
john
fellows
was
a
hard
case
and
could
bear
pain
or
any
other
human
calamity
with
fortitude
he
lay
on
his
back
gritting
his
teeth
and
squirting
the
floor
with
whenever
he
spoke
it
was
with
a
curious
dry
humour
that
seldom
appeared
in
his
ordinary
conversation
he
never
complained
of
his
own
sufferings
though
he
cursed
the
criminal
economy
of
the
mawne
management
in
the
matter
of
they
might
as
well
use
as
this
norway
stuff
they
ve
put
a
stopper
on
my
football
he
said
but
i
ll
see
that
they
pay
for
it
i
will
and
no
fear
indeed
they
owed
him
something
the
collapse
of
coal
that
had
buried
him
had
taken
place
in
a
remote
gallery
on
one
of
the
lower
levels
of
the
mine
and
though
mr
willis
proud
of
his
electric
lighting
and
american
machinery
was
in
the
habit
of
describing
mawne
as
a
pit
the
arrangements
for
salvage
were
by
no
means
elegant
john
fellows
had
lain
for
three
hours
beneath
a
ton
or
more
of
coal
and
though
the
weight
of
it
saved
him
from
the
pain
of
movement
acting
as
a
kind
of
ponderous
splint
to
the
broken
limb
the
suspense
of
waiting
till
he
was
dug
out
would
have
broken
the
nerve
of
a
more
sensitive
man
from
this
purgatory
he
had
been
hauled
to
one
of
the
that
traverse
the
galleries
of
the
pit
his
only
moment
of
relative
smoothness
between
the
scene
of
the
accident
and
his
home
being
his
upward
journey
in
the
hoisting
cage
they
waited
anxiously
for
the
doctor
the
boy
made
three
more
journeys
to
the
lyttleton
arms
for
brandy
it
s
the
only
thing
that
keeps
the
life
in
me
john
fellows
said
in
a
couple
of
hours
dr
moorhouse
arrived
sorry
to
see
you
like
this
fellows
he
said
you
d
be
sorrier
if
you
was
me
fellows
grunted
with
the
help
of
alice
they
split
up
his
trouser
leg
and
the
doctor
manipulated
the
thigh
until
he
felt
the
crepitus
of
the
broken
bone
then
he
disturbed
the
patient
no
longer
it
s
a
three
months
job
he
said
you
can
t
have
it
seen
to
properly
here
you
want
you
ll
have
to
go
into
hospital
john
fellows
cried
then
at
last
he
became
fluent
the
brandy
had
stimulated
his
imagination
even
if
it
had
dulled
the
pain
and
he
launched
into
an
uncompromising
statement
of
the
opinions
with
which
poor
people
regard
the
institutions
that
are
erected
for
their
care
he
made
it
plain
that
at
any
rate
wasn
t
going
to
die
in
any
hospital
or
be
pulled
about
by
any
students
and
not
a
spot
of
drink
i
don
t
want
you
to
die
in
any
hospital
the
doctor
said
he
was
painfully
used
to
this
kind
of
outburst
it
was
always
a
long
and
bitter
controversy
and
it
always
ended
as
he
knew
well
in
submission
while
john
fellows
was
fuming
he
fixed
him
up
on
a
temporary
splint
and
then
went
home
to
telephone
for
the
ambulance
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
his
eyes
fell
on
the
patient
face
of
mrs
moseley
who
had
driven
up
on
the
cart
of
a
friendly
baker
as
soon
as
she
heard
the
news
you
here
again
he
cried
upon
my
word
a
lunatic
asylum
s
the
place
for
you
take
your
leg
out
of
my
sight
i
never
want
to
see
it
again
i
wash
my
hands
of
you
he
went
off
grumbling
and
mrs
moseley
climbed
the
stairs
it
pleased
john
fellows
to
see
her
indeed
from
the
moment
of
her
arrival
he
would
not
let
any
one
else
touch
him
in
the
old
days
alice
would
have
been
jealous
but
hardship
and
difficulty
had
so
changed
her
nature
that
she
even
concerned
herself
with
mrs
moseley
s
comfort
the
old
woman
moved
about
the
room
like
a
soothing
influence
and
when
an
hour
later
the
ambulance
arrived
she
insisted
on
accompanying
her
old
friend
to
the
infirmary
at
north
bromwich
john
fellows
went
off
cheerfully
with
a
quartern
of
brandy
in
his
coat
pocket
he
was
even
bright
enough
to
joke
with
mr
higgins
who
now
arrived
on
the
scene
having
just
discovered
the
key
of
the
in
his
john
fellows
s
removal
to
hospital
made
no
great
difference
to
any
one
but
alice
to
her
the
relief
was
enormous
for
it
not
only
saved
her
the
trouble
of
irregular
meals
allowing
her
to
devote
her
days
to
her
baby
but
freed
her
nights
from
at
the
best
uncertainty
and
at
the
worst
terror
now
when
abner
had
said
to
her
she
need
no
longer
sit
with
her
nerves
on
edge
waiting
for
fellows
to
come
home
wondering
what
would
be
the
humour
of
his
entrance
instead
of
this
she
now
sat
over
the
fire
for
half
an
hour
of
luxurious
drowsiness
then
picked
up
the
baby
and
went
off
placidly
to
bed
of
course
she
had
to
go
easy
with
her
housekeeping
expenditure
for
all
john
fellows
s
club
pay
would
be
absorbed
in
paying
for
tobacco
and
other
luxuries
such
as
butter
which
the
hospital
did
not
provide
for
its
patients
but
abner
as
soon
as
he
realised
this
told
her
that
she
could
count
on
the
pound
a
week
that
he
earned
from
the
football
club
and
more
if
necessary
for
during
the
last
year
he
had
found
it
possible
to
put
by
a
few
sovereigns
for
himself
alice
did
not
find
it
necessary
however
to
draw
on
his
reserves
her
own
tastes
were
simple
and
abner
was
easily
pleased
indeed
john
fellows
had
always
been
the
most
expensive
member
of
the
household
abner
was
now
in
strict
training
for
the
with
the
albion
and
went
to
bed
early
every
night
the
mawne
directors
as
mr
hudson
had
foretold
jumped
at
the
big
club
s
offer
to
play
the
match
at
north
bromwich
tempted
not
only
by
the
welcome
hundred
pounds
but
by
the
prospect
of
an
even
bigger
share
of
the
team
went
through
their
training
with
the
greatest
earnestness
every
afternoon
they
turned
out
on
the
mawne
ground
practising
passing
shooting
and
tactics
followed
by
the
eyes
of
the
trainer
an
international
long
since
retired
who
walked
about
the
field
carrying
always
a
black
bag
that
contained
lemons
elastic
bandages
and
a
patent
embrocation
of
his
own
that
smelt
like
elliman
s
nobody
who
saw
these
men
at
practice
could
possibly
have
suspected
that
they
thought
of
anything
but
winning
their
match
though
each
of
them
must
have
known
that
all
the
others
had
been
offered
ten
pounds
a
head
to
lose
it
in
the
where
they
stood
rubbing
each
other
down
with
in
the
clouds
of
steam
that
the
cold
air
condensed
from
half
a
dozen
tin
baths
of
hot
water
they
talked
of
plans
and
prospects
just
as
if
no
shadow
of
corruption
had
ever
approached
them
nobody
had
mentioned
the
subject
to
abner
since
hudson
had
tackled
him
at
the
works
that
no
doubt
was
the
policy
of
those
who
had
put
up
the
money
to
let
the
thought
of
it
sink
in
over
a
period
of
ten
days
and
trust
to
the
frailty
of
human
nature
on
the
eleventh
they
knew
their
business
for
the
mere
presence
of
such
a
disturbing
problem
was
enough
to
demoralise
the
team
on
the
day
before
the
match
the
mawne
goalkeeper
sprained
his
ankle
at
practice
and
neither
the
bandages
nor
the
embrocation
of
the
trainer
could
restore
him
in
this
emergency
the
committee
called
upon
george
harper
who
had
retired
four
or
five
years
before
and
was
now
a
man
of
substance
and
landlord
of
a
to
take
his
place
abner
who
had
always
been
on
good
terms
with
this
idol
of
his
boyhood
went
up
to
him
after
the
last
practice
game
and
told
him
of
hudson
s
offer
harper
listened
to
him
in
silence
nodding
his
head
but
when
abner
asked
him
if
he
too
had
been
approached
by
hudson
he
only
laughed
hudson
he
said
that
no
fear
of
that
he
dursen
t
come
near
me
he
knows
what
he
d
get
does
mr
in
spite
of
this
when
the
team
were
assembled
in
the
of
the
albion
ground
on
the
day
of
the
abner
saw
the
trainer
take
george
harper
aside
he
talked
excitedly
in
a
low
voice
but
harper
only
went
red
in
the
face
and
said
nothing
as
they
left
the
abner
winked
at
george
and
george
solemnly
winked
back
at
him
the
captain
kicked
the
ball
into
the
middle
of
the
field
and
the
mawne
team
ran
out
after
him
amid
a
spreading
uproar
of
cheers
the
turf
of
the
albion
ground
was
incredibly
smooth
and
level
after
the
rough
field
in
which
they
were
accustomed
to
play
at
mawne
the
place
was
indeed
a
vast
oval
amphitheatre
with
high
stands
rising
above
the
on
the
west
and
on
every
other
side
a
sloping
embankment
so
packed
with
people
that
the
ground
on
which
they
stood
could
nowhere
be
seen
the
vastness
of
this
multitude
was
imposing
in
its
ugliness
its
pale
restless
masses
represented
on
a
horrible
scale
the
grimy
flatness
of
the
city
complexion
from
the
crowd
a
low
murmur
arose
like
the
noise
of
the
sea
breaking
on
distant
shingles
and
over
all
its
surface
floated
a
fume
of
tobacco
smoke
a
moment
later
the
albion
team
emerged
the
crowd
swayed
and
the
murmur
swelled
to
a
roar
of
welcome
the
chocolate
and
yellow
jerseys
of
mawne
so
nearly
resembled
the
albion
s
colours
that
the
home
team
turned
out
in
white
shirts
and
knickers
it
was
partly
the
spotlessness
of
this
attire
that
made
them
seem
like
a
company
of
athletic
giants
swifter
more
flexible
and
stronger
than
their
opponents
even
abner
s
six
feet
were
dwarfed
by
the
diverse
colours
of
his
clothes
it
seemed
a
ridiculous
thing
to
match
this
shabby
team
of
stunted
pitmen
with
eleven
picked
athletes
the
game
began
almost
at
once
the
white
line
of
the
albion
forwards
was
in
motion
it
was
a
lovely
sight
a
lesson
in
fleetness
elasticity
and
precision
the
albion
taking
no
risks
had
included
a
number
of
their
first
league
players
in
the
team
and
it
looked
as
if
mawne
must
be
nowhere
abner
at
centre
half
the
pivotal
position
of
the
whole
field
felt
that
he
could
do
no
more
than
play
a
spoiling
game
against
this
perfect
machine
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
knew
also
that
a
certain
number
probably
the
majority
of
the
mawne
players
were
not
anxious
to
win
it
is
not
easy
however
to
play
deliberately
a
losing
game
or
indeed
to
play
football
with
any
degree
of
deliberation
the
heat
of
the
game
seemed
to
inspire
the
mawne
team
to
a
stubborn
almost
desperate
defence
as
a
last
barrier
to
the
albion
attacks
he
knew
that
george
harper
even
if
he
were
an
old
stager
was
incorruptible
and
george
harper
in
his
prime
had
never
played
a
more
marvellous
game
perhaps
the
feeling
that
he
belonged
to
an
older
and
more
gifted
generation
of
footballers
helped
him
time
after
time
when
the
albion
forwards
came
swinging
down
the
field
in
a
perfect
crescent
he
saved
the
mawne
goal
his
play
was
inspired
and
when
came
no
goal
had
been
scored
the
players
stood
sweating
in
the
the
trainer
handed
round
cut
lemons
once
again
abner
saw
him
approach
george
harper
and
take
him
by
the
sleeve
but
this
time
the
goalkeeper
pushed
him
away
mr
willis
came
down
into
the
to
congratulate
the
players
he
was
smoking
a
big
cigar
and
evidently
immensely
pleased
with
himself
he
at
any
rate
was
above
suspicion
the
referee
called
the
players
out
again
in
the
second
half
abner
worked
as
he
had
never
worked
before
the
mawne
team
was
tiring
play
grew
scrappy
and
spiteful
but
though
the
albion
players
could
do
what
they
liked
with
the
ball
in
midfield
they
did
not
seem
able
to
score
even
if
mawne
were
equally
ineffective
it
seemed
probable
that
the
match
would
end
in
a
draw
the
albion
crowd
grew
restless
and
began
to
think
that
the
referee
was
favouring
their
opponents
the
albion
players
now
a
little
rattled
tried
to
effect
by
roughness
what
they
could
not
achieve
by
skill
several
were
given
against
them
for
fouls
and
the
crowd
began
to
boo
the
referee
it
was
like
the
hollow
voice
of
some
sullen
the
albion
encouraged
by
the
support
of
the
crowd
pursued
these
tactics
two
men
were
ordered
off
for
fighting
a
moment
later
the
crowd
regained
its
good
humour
stimulated
by
the
sight
of
a
shot
from
the
albion
that
hit
the
above
george
harper
s
head
if
the
shot
had
been
three
inches
lower
he
could
not
possibly
have
saved
it
the
kick
that
followed
transferred
the
play
to
the
other
end
of
the
field
it
was
close
on
time
and
everybody
was
nervous
a
centre
from
the
mawne
outside
right
came
to
abner
s
feet
in
front
of
the
albion
goal
one
of
the
albion
backs
tried
to
trip
him
getting
cleverly
on
the
blind
side
of
the
referee
abner
stumbled
free
and
since
the
goal
was
now
open
the
player
lashed
out
at
his
ear
abner
s
temper
was
up
he
left
the
ball
and
closed
with
his
opponent
the
mawne
team
held
up
their
hands
and
called
on
the
referee
like
one
man
a
violent
fight
had
begun
when
the
referee
arrived
shaking
himself
free
from
a
gesticulating
escort
of
mawne
players
the
albion
men
separated
the
fighters
and
though
the
referee
warned
both
of
them
that
if
anything
more
happened
he
would
send
them
off
he
gave
a
free
kick
to
mawne
the
crowd
howled
it
seemed
for
a
moment
as
if
they
would
burst
their
barriers
and
swarm
on
to
the
field
very
grimly
his
face
streaming
with
blood
abner
took
the
kick
the
albion
goalkeeper
making
a
high
save
tipped
the
ball
over
the
a
corner
the
players
lined
up
panting
in
front
of
the
albion
goal
the
young
outside
right
whose
centre
had
been
the
beginning
of
the
trouble
took
the
kick
the
ball
sailed
high
and
fell
slowly
into
the
of
players
abner
who
had
proved
his
dangerousness
was
carefully
marked
and
charged
at
as
the
ball
fell
but
he
butted
his
opponent
aside
and
making
full
use
of
his
superior
height
managed
to
head
it
into
the
top
corner
of
the
net
a
shout
of
goal
rose
from
the
crowd
but
there
was
no
applause
the
strange
thing
about
the
whole
business
was
the
attitude
of
the
mawne
players
these
men
who
had
been
playing
a
game
all
afternoon
appeared
to
be
overwhelmed
with
joy
they
ran
up
to
abner
and
shook
both
his
hands
as
if
there
had
been
no
matter
of
ten
pounds
depending
on
his
achievement
even
george
harper
came
running
down
the
field
and
patted
him
on
the
back
george
had
his
work
cut
out
for
in
the
last
three
minutes
of
the
game
the
albion
made
a
desperate
effort
to
equalise
and
subjected
him
to
an
incessant
bombardment
luck
aided
his
skill
and
when
the
whistle
went
for
time
mawne
had
won
their
match
abner
went
home
that
night
with
a
thick
ear
and
a
slowly
closing
right
eye
he
was
tired
and
sore
but
elated
he
wanted
to
do
nothing
but
sit
in
front
of
the
fire
and
think
over
again
the
progress
of
the
match
alice
on
the
other
hand
was
terribly
concerned
with
his
injuries
she
dressed
his
face
with
some
ointment
that
mrs
moseley
had
recommended
her
for
the
baby
and
sat
opposite
to
him
burning
with
pain
and
indignation
i
wish
you
d
give
it
up
abner
she
said
one
of
these
days
you
ll
get
killed
it
s
downright
brutal
it
s
worse
than
that
s
what
it
was
abner
chuckled
he
pretended
that
he
didn
t
want
her
to
fuss
over
him
but
all
the
same
this
devotion
was
very
pleasant
as
for
alice
the
pain
of
seeing
him
so
battered
was
almost
equalled
by
her
pleasure
in
tending
him
and
they
were
alone
she
was
thankful
that
they
were
alone
time
after
time
she
returned
to
her
pleading
that
he
would
give
up
football
you
ve
never
come
home
in
a
state
like
this
she
said
give
up
football
said
abner
and
what
would
we
live
on
then
you
couldn
t
manage
and
that
s
straight
i
d
do
it
she
said
i
d
manage
he
laughed
at
her
intensity
don
t
you
fret
yourself
about
me
he
said
i
m
all
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
like
a
log
she
brought
him
breakfast
and
clean
dressings
to
his
bedroom
on
monday
morning
down
at
the
works
mr
willis
met
him
good
lad
he
said
good
lad
later
in
the
day
mr
hudson
came
down
from
the
office
to
the
place
where
he
was
working
he
smiled
to
conceal
his
annoyance
well
i
suppose
we
ve
got
to
thank
you
and
harper
for
the
win
he
said
i
reckon
we
ve
not
got
to
thank
you
abner
replied
h
m
that
s
it
is
it
said
hudson
you
d
better
go
up
to
the
for
your
time
enough
when
i
ve
finished
said
abner
football
always
prevented
him
from
collecting
his
pay
on
a
saturday
morning
with
the
other
men
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
went
to
the
pay
clerk
instead
of
shillings
as
usual
he
was
given
fifty
what
s
this
for
he
asked
lieu
of
a
week
s
notice
said
the
clerk
the
gaffer
says
we
have
to
cut
down
mr
hudson
s
hudson
said
abner
angrily
the
sixth
chapter
that
night
he
went
down
to
the
for
the
first
time
since
the
day
of
susan
s
defection
more
than
a
year
before
the
crowd
at
the
royal
oak
were
glad
to
see
him
for
they
were
still
talking
about
nothing
else
but
the
result
of
the
every
one
was
anxious
to
treat
him
and
to
condole
with
him
on
his
black
eye
and
he
was
prepared
to
drink
as
much
as
they
would
give
him
standing
his
own
share
up
to
the
limit
of
the
fifty
shillings
in
his
pocket
as
long
as
he
could
forget
the
anger
with
which
he
had
left
the
works
if
he
didn
t
somehow
get
the
idea
of
his
injury
out
of
his
mind
he
felt
that
he
would
probably
go
down
to
hudson
s
private
house
and
wring
his
neck
in
the
royal
oak
drinking
nothing
but
hot
whisky
he
managed
to
lose
himself
and
the
troubles
of
the
day
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
warmth
and
comfort
of
the
private
bar
the
dark
varnished
walls
the
polished
beer
engine
the
shining
rows
of
bottles
the
crackle
of
the
bright
fire
for
a
time
the
room
was
also
full
of
jolly
people
who
laughed
and
spoke
with
loud
buoyant
voices
the
happiest
company
imaginable
the
spirituous
air
was
exhilarating
and
endowed
all
the
contents
of
the
bar
from
the
postage
stamps
on
the
ceiling
to
the
brass
spittoons
and
sawdust
of
the
floor
with
a
quality
of
unusual
vividness
at
last
this
curious
clarity
faded
and
the
details
that
had
seemed
for
some
curious
reason
exciting
became
blurred
abner
tucked
up
his
feet
on
a
settle
covered
with
american
leather
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
when
he
awoke
his
old
friend
joe
hodgetts
was
piloting
him
home
along
the
stourton
road
under
a
sky
of
dancing
stars
alice
was
waiting
up
for
him
supper
was
laid
on
the
table
and
she
rose
from
her
chair
by
the
fire
to
welcome
him
as
he
entered
the
new
light
dazzled
him
and
as
he
stood
uncertainly
at
the
door
he
took
hold
of
the
red
curtain
to
steady
himself
and
lurching
pulled
it
down
from
its
string
alice
gave
a
cry
even
though
she
knew
the
symptoms
well
enough
in
her
husband
she
couldn
t
believe
that
abner
was
drunk
she
only
saw
him
standing
there
with
the
great
discoloured
bruise
on
his
flushed
face
he
held
the
curtain
in
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
stupidly
as
if
he
didn
t
know
what
to
do
with
it
abner
what
s
up
with
you
she
said
running
to
take
it
from
him
there
s
nowt
up
with
me
he
said
solemnly
i
m
drunk
that
s
all
if
any
one
s
a
right
to
be
drunk
it
s
the
equanimity
with
which
she
had
trained
herself
to
receive
john
fellows
in
such
circumstances
deserted
her
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
was
no
use
arguing
with
a
drunken
man
but
the
case
of
abner
was
so
exceptional
that
she
began
to
do
so
he
took
no
notice
of
her
and
then
she
rated
him
violently
so
that
overcome
by
a
sudden
flush
of
anger
he
took
hold
of
her
arms
as
if
he
were
going
to
throw
her
down
he
had
never
taken
hold
of
her
like
that
before
she
faced
him
panting
for
breath
and
they
stared
into
each
other
s
eyes
he
felt
the
warmth
of
her
arms
through
the
sleeve
of
her
bodice
and
realised
her
for
the
first
time
as
a
living
creature
she
trembled
under
his
gaze
but
did
not
try
to
free
herself
he
felt
that
something
like
this
had
happened
before
remembered
susan
suddenly
sobered
almost
frightened
he
relaxed
his
grip
on
her
arms
still
she
did
not
move
she
stood
dazed
with
her
breath
coming
and
going
i
m
going
to
bed
he
said
he
staggered
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
left
her
standing
there
when
he
had
gone
she
pulled
herself
together
and
put
her
hands
to
her
eyes
as
though
she
wanted
to
shut
out
what
she
had
seen
she
had
forgotten
her
first
resentment
and
the
emotion
with
which
she
trembled
now
was
one
that
frightened
her
and
put
her
to
shame
she
felt
that
she
had
just
experienced
the
most
thrilling
moment
of
her
life
after
that
she
could
never
pretend
to
herself
that
she
was
not
in
love
with
abner
in
the
morning
he
woke
early
before
alice
knew
that
he
was
astir
he
went
downstairs
in
his
stockinged
feet
and
lit
the
kitchen
fire
by
the
time
that
she
herself
appeared
he
had
made
himself
a
cup
of
tea
and
laid
the
table
for
breakfast
neither
of
them
spoke
of
his
violent
homecoming
the
night
before
or
of
the
stranger
scene
that
followed
it
she
had
half
expected
that
he
would
ask
her
pardon
for
what
had
happened
but
such
a
proceeding
didn
t
seem
to
him
important
he
had
been
drunk
now
he
was
sober
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter
when
breakfast
was
over
he
went
out
into
the
dank
washhouse
and
shaved
she
was
puzzled
to
see
that
he
was
not
going
to
work
for
he
had
dressed
in
his
sunday
clothes
and
wore
his
decorated
with
a
couple
of
silver
football
medals
at
last
she
plucked
up
courage
to
ask
him
if
he
was
not
going
to
mawne
no
he
said
i
bain
t
going
there
no
what
s
up
then
got
the
sack
he
said
laconically
but
the
money
she
said
we
ve
got
to
i
picked
up
two
weeks
pay
last
night
you
can
have
what
s
he
turned
out
his
pockets
and
gave
her
a
handful
of
small
change
that
s
more
than
i
reckoned
there
d
be
he
said
she
threw
down
the
money
on
the
table
and
stared
at
him
i
owe
more
nor
this
she
said
what
about
the
football
money
don
t
talk
to
me
about
football
he
said
i
ve
done
with
football
as
long
as
that
hudson
s
on
the
the
situation
baffled
her
money
they
must
have
and
she
was
quick
to
rack
her
brains
for
some
way
in
which
it
could
be
got
an
inspiration
came
to
her
you
didn
t
ought
to
work
with
your
eye
in
that
state
she
said
better
go
down
to
the
doctor
s
and
put
yourself
on
the
box
you
ve
been
paying
into
that
club
long
enough
and
not
had
a
penny
out
of
club
said
abner
i
don
t
sponge
on
no
clubs
i
m
going
down
to
the
pit
to
see
the
doggy
i
reckon
he
ll
find
me
a
job
he
lit
his
pipe
and
went
out
into
the
frosty
morning
a
delayed
impulse
made
her
want
to
give
him
his
knitted
but
it
came
too
late
she
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
it
in
a
single
night
all
the
pleasant
ordered
happiness
of
the
life
that
they
had
been
leading
since
john
fellows
s
accident
had
been
overwhelmed
she
felt
it
unreasonable
incredible
that
this
should
have
happened
she
could
not
even
solace
herself
with
the
care
of
her
baby
who
was
now
beginning
to
babble
and
to
stagger
with
uncertain
steps
from
chair
to
chair
she
found
herself
wishing
for
a
moment
that
there
wasn
t
a
kid
to
worry
about
and
was
as
quickly
bitten
with
remorse
for
she
knew
that
the
baby
was
her
most
precious
possession
on
earth
she
could
settle
down
to
nothing
the
foundations
of
her
routine
life
had
been
dissolved
she
had
not
even
money
enough
to
meet
the
bills
that
she
always
paid
on
mondays
but
the
thought
of
money
was
nothing
to
her
compared
with
her
anxiety
as
to
abner
s
attitude
toward
herself
she
found
a
little
comfort
in
thinking
that
he
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
debauch
and
that
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
they
might
take
up
their
relation
at
the
point
where
it
had
been
so
abruptly
convulsed
on
this
her
whole
happiness
depended
abner
s
visit
to
the
pit
was
satisfactory
in
so
far
as
it
procured
him
without
the
least
difficulty
a
job
underground
he
was
a
trained
miner
and
in
those
days
when
the
output
of
the
mine
had
been
diminished
by
a
series
of
accidents
and
a
growing
tendency
to
work
short
time
any
new
hand
was
welcome
at
mawne
pit
when
he
came
back
in
the
evening
he
reassured
alice
that
even
if
they
had
to
go
easy
in
the
matter
of
expenditure
they
need
not
starve
in
the
interval
before
john
fellows
returned
to
double
their
income
to
meet
the
present
emergency
he
handed
her
the
sovereign
that
he
had
received
from
the
football
club
if
that
sod
hudson
had
had
his
way
you
d
have
had
ten
he
said
enigmatically
you
d
better
send
a
nipper
to
the
oak
with
my
boots
and
football
gear
he
told
her
i
ve
done
with
mawne
she
was
thankful
for
his
solution
of
her
money
difficulties
for
pride
would
not
have
allowed
her
to
face
the
butcher
and
the
grocer
without
the
money
in
her
hand
in
spite
of
the
loss
that
it
implied
she
couldn
t
reasonably
refuse
to
be
glad
that
he
had
abandoned
football
since
she
had
so
often
begged
him
to
do
so
what
troubled
her
far
more
than
this
was
the
fact
that
his
attitude
toward
her
was
changed
it
was
clear
that
he
had
not
been
too
drunk
to
realise
the
significance
of
the
moment
when
he
had
held
her
in
his
arms
and
they
had
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
he
had
seen
the
emotional
precipice
on
the
edge
of
which
they
were
standing
well
so
had
she
but
that
seemed
to
her
no
reason
why
they
should
not
pretend
that
things
were
as
they
had
always
been
she
was
content
to
play
her
part
even
for
their
common
comfort
to
forget
what
had
happened
the
only
thing
that
she
could
not
bear
was
that
he
should
avoid
her
as
though
she
were
an
evil
thing
to
be
feared
and
distrusted
this
in
effect
was
what
he
did
to
drink
habitually
was
not
in
his
nature
when
he
drank
he
did
so
simply
as
a
means
to
escape
from
himself
or
from
some
harassing
emotion
and
so
he
did
not
seek
a
refuge
as
she
had
feared
he
would
in
a
public
house
none
the
less
it
soon
became
clear
that
the
pleasant
homely
evenings
at
hackett
s
cottages
were
now
at
an
end
the
chair
which
alice
always
arranged
for
him
at
the
fireside
was
never
occupied
when
he
came
home
from
the
pit
at
night
and
had
washed
himself
in
the
scullery
he
now
went
out
again
to
spend
the
evenings
with
his
friends
with
old
mr
higgins
with
george
harper
or
with
mrs
moseley
he
hated
his
work
at
the
colliery
the
dark
cramped
labour
in
remote
subterranean
stalls
was
a
terrible
change
from
his
free
and
easy
life
at
the
furnaces
he
hated
the
dirt
no
less
than
the
darkness
and
it
scarcely
mended
matters
to
realise
that
he
was
wanted
at
the
pit
opportunities
of
escape
soon
presented
themselves
the
retirement
of
their
most
promising
player
from
the
united
team
created
a
sensation
not
only
in
mawne
but
in
the
surrounding
towns
abner
would
give
no
explanation
for
it
when
people
asked
him
why
he
was
not
playing
for
mawne
he
merely
told
them
to
go
and
ask
hudson
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
change
his
team
in
the
middle
of
the
season
without
an
official
transfer
the
secretary
of
the
albion
made
a
special
journey
to
halesby
to
ask
him
to
consent
to
this
but
since
this
proceeding
would
have
presented
the
mawne
club
with
a
handsome
transfer
fee
he
refused
the
albion
offered
him
good
and
easy
work
in
north
bromwich
if
he
would
sign
on
for
them
next
season
you
can
have
it
for
the
asking
they
he
refused
for
though
he
would
have
liked
nothing
better
he
felt
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
desert
alice
in
her
present
emergency
until
his
father
returned
it
was
his
duty
to
stay
with
her
the
winter
wore
on
and
john
fellows
whose
alcoholic
history
made
him
a
bad
subject
for
a
fractured
still
lay
in
hospital
abner
stuck
to
his
thankless
labours
at
the
pit
he
worked
longer
underground
than
he
need
have
done
simply
for
the
reason
that
he
did
not
want
to
spend
his
evenings
in
the
dangerous
company
of
alice
after
that
night
he
knew
that
he
could
not
wholly
trust
himself
his
earnings
were
now
sufficient
to
keep
the
household
in
comfort
and
the
money
that
he
drew
from
his
overtime
he
put
aside
for
an
emergency
concealing
them
in
an
old
stocking
underneath
the
mattress
of
his
bed
he
wanted
to
be
sure
of
his
liberty
as
soon
as
his
father
returned
at
christmas
alice
made
a
heroic
attempt
to
recover
her
lost
happiness
a
week
before
the
festival
she
went
down
into
the
market
at
halesby
and
bought
a
branch
of
berried
holly
which
she
hung
above
the
middle
of
the
table
from
a
nail
that
had
once
supported
a
hanging
lamp
she
decorated
the
branch
with
cheap
trifles
flags
lustred
balls
and
candles
of
coloured
wax
in
metal
clips
shaped
like
butterflies
over
the
mantelpiece
she
pinned
a
scroll
of
varnished
paper
with
god
bless
our
home
in
gothic
characters
upon
it
and
in
various
inaccessible
places
she
put
sprigs
of
mistletoe
although
she
said
nothing
to
abner
it
was
evident
that
she
was
counting
on
him
to
celebrate
the
feast
at
home
a
few
days
before
the
event
she
showed
him
a
present
that
she
had
bought
for
the
child
a
wooden
horse
with
red
nostrils
a
lambskin
mane
and
a
ridiculous
dab
of
a
tail
even
this
failed
to
move
him
and
up
to
the
last
moment
she
was
in
doubt
as
to
whether
he
would
forsake
her
she
schemed
her
very
hardest
to
keep
him
using
as
a
bait
the
child
whose
curious
ways
and
stumbling
attempts
at
speech
amused
him
this
creature
loved
above
all
things
to
be
caught
up
and
perched
on
the
dizzy
height
of
abner
s
shoulder
so
high
that
he
was
able
to
examine
the
unexplored
country
of
the
ceiling
he
also
loved
to
play
with
tiger
who
now
came
and
went
in
hackett
s
cottages
of
his
own
accord
tiger
liked
children
and
he
and
little
john
would
roll
over
together
on
the
kitchen
floor
alice
always
made
the
dog
welcome
tempting
him
with
such
bones
as
never
entered
mrs
moseley
s
house
he
was
a
link
with
abner
and
therefore
to
be
encouraged
in
the
end
abner
spent
christmas
day
at
hackett
s
cottages
or
to
be
exact
the
morning
and
evening
of
it
for
the
afternoon
he
devoted
to
watching
the
league
match
between
mawne
united
and
dulston
on
the
royal
oak
ground
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
forget
football
altogether
even
though
he
persisted
in
his
determination
not
to
play
in
spite
of
all
alice
s
pathetic
efforts
the
day
was
not
a
success
in
the
evening
when
they
sat
over
the
fire
and
mr
higgins
who
had
brought
in
a
basket
of
oranges
had
left
them
alone
together
she
made
a
direct
attempt
to
have
the
matter
out
with
him
why
are
you
so
funny
with
me
abner
she
said
i
don
t
know
what
i
ve
done
that
you
should
treat
me
distant
like
this
you
didn
t
use
to
do
but
he
would
not
answer
you
ve
took
a
turn
against
me
she
said
i
know
you
have
what
is
it
i
ve
done
ain
t
done
nothing
he
said
and
ain
t
took
a
turn
again
you
neither
i
m
all
right
if
so
be
you
ll
leave
me
yo
m
different
even
with
our
john
she
said
don
t
yo
bother
he
said
at
last
it
ll
be
different
time
ourn
comes
back
he
must
be
getting
on
a
bit
she
had
to
leave
it
at
that
it
had
been
a
difficult
evening
for
abner
for
in
spite
of
her
troubles
the
firelight
and
the
excitement
that
the
baby
s
pleasure
in
his
presents
had
given
her
made
her
look
very
attractive
in
her
own
fragile
way
when
ourn
comes
back
she
sighed
for
she
felt
that
john
fellows
s
return
would
put
an
end
even
to
the
small
measure
of
happiness
that
she
managed
to
extract
from
the
present
when
john
fellows
came
back
she
would
be
faced
with
all
the
old
desperate
problems
the
old
terrible
nights
as
they
sat
over
the
fire
she
turned
her
face
aside
to
hide
the
tears
that
came
into
her
eyes
abner
puffed
stolidly
at
his
pipe
when
he
comes
back
he
said
i
reckon
i
ll
have
a
look
round
for
another
where
she
asked
in
alarm
oh
anywhere
out
of
this
place
he
said
i
m
sick
of
halesby
i
reckon
i
ll
go
to
coventry
or
wales
there
s
good
money
in
abner
she
cried
oh
abner
you
m
not
going
to
leave
me
not
with
him
i
couldn
t
abide
it
abner
abner
if
you
leave
me
i
ll
make
a
hole
in
the
cut
god
strike
me
if
i
won
t
she
could
contain
herself
no
longer
and
went
sobbing
upstairs
abner
found
it
difficult
to
resist
an
impulse
to
follow
her
and
comfort
her
he
was
not
used
to
a
woman
s
tears
he
got
as
far
as
the
foot
of
the
stairs
then
slowly
turned
back
and
sat
on
smoking
till
midnight
amid
the
pathetic
decorations
of
that
poor
room
his
reflections
determined
him
more
than
ever
to
cut
himself
free
from
the
embarrassments
of
life
at
halesby
coventry
was
almost
too
near
yes
he
would
go
down
into
wales
on
his
way
upstairs
he
listened
for
a
moment
outside
her
bedroom
door
he
thought
he
heard
her
still
sobbing
under
the
sheets
but
when
he
listened
the
sound
of
sobbing
stopped
next
day
she
had
quite
regained
her
they
went
together
taking
the
baby
with
them
to
visit
john
fellows
in
the
north
bromwich
infirmary
they
found
him
lying
in
a
long
clean
ward
festooned
with
christmas
decorations
the
ominous
erection
of
an
apparatus
of
weights
and
pulleys
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
emphasised
his
helplessness
he
did
not
appear
to
be
very
pleased
to
see
them
and
his
embraces
so
frightened
the
baby
that
he
set
up
a
howl
the
baby
need
not
have
been
frightened
for
john
fellows
was
far
less
impressive
than
he
had
been
in
his
former
state
the
whole
man
seemed
to
have
shrunk
he
was
newly
shaved
his
rough
hands
had
become
clean
and
almost
transparent
but
though
he
now
looked
as
if
he
couldn
t
hurt
any
one
the
presence
of
the
visitors
set
him
grumbling
at
once
from
the
first
he
appeared
to
be
offended
with
abner
because
he
had
not
thought
to
smuggle
in
any
liquor
for
him
you
ain
t
brought
a
spot
he
said
well
you
re
a
fine
son
even
three
months
of
abstinence
had
not
diminished
his
craving
he
told
them
that
he
dreamed
of
liquor
but
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
chance
of
him
getting
any
nearer
to
it
than
in
dreams
for
as
far
as
he
could
see
his
leg
was
exactly
as
it
had
been
when
he
came
into
hospital
after
this
outburst
of
discontent
he
softened
a
little
pinched
alice
s
cheek
played
a
little
with
the
baby
who
had
by
this
time
overcome
his
fears
and
even
talked
to
abner
about
football
in
this
way
he
heard
the
story
of
the
albion
match
and
mawne
committee
s
attempt
to
square
the
players
at
first
he
was
enthusiastic
about
george
harper
s
resistance
to
the
corrupting
influence
but
on
second
thoughts
he
disapproved
of
it
i
reckon
you
and
george
done
your
mates
a
bad
turn
it
ain
t
every
day
you
can
pick
up
ten
pound
for
the
only
thing
that
modified
his
opinion
was
the
dislike
that
he
shared
with
all
the
other
men
at
mawne
of
hudson
hudson
he
said
i
wish
you
d
a
finished
him
while
abner
and
his
father
were
talking
football
alice
had
approached
the
sister
a
dark
woman
whose
features
and
hair
and
eyes
were
as
rigid
and
sharp
and
metallic
as
the
scissors
hanging
from
her
starched
belt
on
the
subject
of
john
fellows
s
progress
this
woman
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
are
you
fellows
s
daughter
she
asked
no
sister
i
m
his
he
s
the
worst
grumbler
we
ve
ever
had
in
this
ward
said
the
sister
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
s
getting
on
finely
the
doctor
says
the
bone
is
set
nicely
and
he
should
be
out
in
a
couple
of
weeks
now
i
expect
they
ll
send
him
out
on
a
thomas
s
splint
you
don
t
know
what
that
is
she
added
with
a
rather
scornful
intonation
but
then
noticing
that
alice
looked
tired
she
took
her
into
her
bunk
and
gave
her
a
cup
of
tea
i
couldn
t
imagine
that
you
were
fellows
s
wife
she
said
and
this
his
baby
i
thought
your
husband
was
the
young
man
who
came
with
he
and
baby
s
alice
explained
blushing
by
mr
fellows
s
first
wife
you
well
i
hope
you
ll
be
happy
replied
the
sister
doubtfully
it
s
time
the
visitors
were
going
is
fellows
a
very
heavy
drinker
i
m
afraid
he
is
said
alice
mildly
i
thought
so
said
the
sister
we
ought
to
keep
him
in
here
for
your
sake
but
there
s
always
a
rush
on
surgical
beds
at
christmas
time
you
d
better
call
your
the
seventh
chapter
abner
was
genuinely
relieved
when
alice
told
him
the
good
report
that
the
sister
had
given
her
on
his
father
s
condition
for
it
promised
him
a
speedy
release
from
the
discomfort
of
the
situation
alice
who
had
accustomed
herself
to
examine
every
shade
of
expression
that
he
showed
knew
that
he
was
rejoicing
at
the
prospect
of
leaving
her
the
thought
piqued
her
for
she
had
forced
herself
always
to
behave
toward
him
exactly
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
moment
of
embarrassment
between
them
her
pride
would
not
let
the
matter
rest
you
m
glad
he
s
coming
back
she
said
i
know
you
i
m
glad
his
leg
s
joined
if
that
s
what
you
mean
he
replied
that
s
only
besides
it
s
best
for
and
what
about
me
she
asked
passionately
he
would
not
answer
and
she
flowed
on
with
a
stream
of
reproaches
telling
him
that
she
knew
he
hated
her
and
couldn
t
bear
the
sight
of
her
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
driven
to
say
that
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
abner
remained
passive
he
knew
very
well
that
if
he
were
to
lose
his
temper
with
her
the
situation
might
easily
become
just
as
dangerous
as
if
he
were
tender
the
main
thing
to
be
avoided
with
her
was
emotion
of
any
kind
life
had
been
made
difficult
enough
for
him
already
simply
because
he
knew
that
their
relation
was
capable
of
passionate
developments
he
knew
what
passion
was
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
could
not
always
banish
the
thought
of
alice
from
his
mind
admitting
this
he
had
mapped
out
a
course
of
conduct
for
himself
and
he
meant
to
stick
to
it
until
the
happy
day
of
his
relief
it
was
not
a
fortnight
but
a
month
before
john
fellows
left
the
hospital
he
came
back
as
the
sister
had
anticipated
with
a
thomas
s
splint
on
his
thigh
and
instructions
to
attend
the
infirmary
as
an
in
another
month
s
time
the
splint
was
an
embarrassment
that
he
resented
for
it
compelled
him
to
sit
in
an
uncomfortable
position
with
the
right
leg
extended
but
it
did
not
prevent
him
walking
or
drinking
and
as
soon
as
he
had
mastered
the
first
of
these
processes
he
lost
no
time
in
making
up
for
his
long
abstinence
from
the
second
the
rules
of
the
friendly
society
to
which
he
belonged
forbade
its
members
to
visit
as
long
as
they
were
receiving
sick
pay
so
that
the
invalid
was
forced
to
enter
the
lyttleton
arms
by
a
back
door
which
he
reached
by
crossing
the
garden
of
a
friend
and
having
once
solved
this
problem
fellows
managed
to
put
in
the
day
without
any
difficulty
every
friday
morning
he
hobbled
down
on
his
crutches
to
the
doctor
s
surgery
and
obtained
a
certificate
by
means
of
which
he
drew
his
weekly
pay
it
was
only
twelve
shillings
a
week
and
he
never
parted
with
a
penny
of
it
to
alice
so
that
the
household
now
depended
entirely
on
abner
s
earnings
it
puzzled
both
of
them
to
imagine
how
he
managed
to
live
in
a
state
of
fuddled
alcoholism
on
this
small
sum
they
supposed
that
his
old
friend
the
landlord
trusting
him
put
it
on
the
slate
in
the
hope
of
being
paid
when
fellows
went
back
to
work
he
had
always
been
free
with
his
money
and
no
doubt
his
boon
companions
of
the
past
were
ready
to
treat
him
as
often
as
they
could
afford
it
at
the
end
of
february
he
went
in
to
north
bromwich
in
accordance
with
the
hospital
orders
and
returned
without
his
splint
the
doctors
had
told
him
that
it
would
now
be
wise
to
use
the
leg
as
much
as
possible
and
suggested
that
the
colliery
authorities
who
were
partly
responsible
for
the
accident
should
now
give
him
a
light
job
at
the
john
fellows
however
didn
t
see
the
point
of
this
he
had
paid
into
the
loyal
united
free
gardeners
for
more
than
thirty
years
and
now
that
he
had
the
chance
he
meant
to
get
some
of
his
money
back
by
staying
on
the
box
as
long
as
they
would
let
him
he
could
get
quite
enough
exercise
for
his
leg
in
his
clandestine
approaches
to
the
lyttleton
arms
what
was
more
he
would
not
do
a
stroke
of
work
until
his
claim
against
the
colliery
was
settled
he
had
consulted
a
solicitor
and
a
claim
under
the
workmen
s
compensation
act
was
pending
abner
meanwhile
waited
impatiently
for
his
release
the
presence
of
his
father
in
the
house
had
eased
the
awkwardness
of
his
relation
with
alice
by
abolishing
the
sense
of
lonely
isolation
that
surrounded
it
alice
herself
was
almost
complacent
she
did
not
mind
how
long
john
fellows
abstained
from
work
as
long
as
abner
was
left
to
her
at
the
end
of
may
the
doctor
refused
to
continue
the
farce
of
signing
the
miner
s
certificates
john
fellows
grumbled
but
had
to
admit
that
he
had
done
fairly
well
out
of
the
club
he
pushed
on
his
claim
for
compensation
which
was
settled
for
fifty
pounds
alice
was
overjoyed
at
this
windfall
for
the
strain
of
her
straitened
housekeeping
had
forced
her
to
run
up
a
few
small
debts
with
tradesmen
she
took
the
opportunity
of
asking
her
husband
for
money
when
abner
was
in
the
room
money
said
john
fellows
money
what
do
yo
want
with
money
what
s
money
to
do
with
me
when
i
ve
a
son
at
work
earning
a
man
s
wages
if
yo
want
money
better
ask
our
abner
didn
t
i
keep
him
all
through
his
schooling
in
food
and
clothes
working
day
and
night
i
reckon
it
s
his
turn
i
bain
t
goin
to
keep
you
in
any
longer
said
abner
you
d
best
give
her
some
while
you
ve
got
it
i
m
going
off
to
work
in
work
in
wales
cried
john
fellows
i
ll
teach
you
to
talk
to
your
father
like
that
he
cried
coming
over
to
him
with
his
head
low
between
his
shoulders
like
an
angry
bull
when
he
reached
his
son
he
stopped
for
abner
had
thrown
back
his
elbow
alice
ran
to
separate
them
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
have
done
so
for
fellows
knew
better
than
to
appeal
to
force
you
re
a
fine
pair
the
two
on
you
he
said
and
don
t
you
go
thinking
i
can
t
he
went
out
of
the
room
with
the
limp
that
he
now
cultivated
and
it
was
well
that
he
did
so
for
by
this
time
abner
was
white
with
rage
he
would
have
followed
his
father
if
alice
had
not
withheld
him
abner
don
t
she
cried
what
did
he
mean
you
know
what
he
meant
as
well
as
i
do
said
abner
with
a
laugh
still
that
don
t
matter
i
m
off
but
he
did
not
go
thinking
the
matter
over
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
abandon
alice
and
her
child
to
the
desolation
that
he
knew
must
follow
his
departure
it
even
seemed
to
him
that
his
going
might
suggest
to
his
father
that
he
had
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
the
fact
that
this
time
alice
knew
better
than
beg
him
to
stay
also
influenced
him
by
this
token
she
accepted
his
independence
and
appealed
only
to
his
generosity
she
never
had
a
penny
of
her
husband
s
fifty
pounds
some
of
it
no
doubt
he
owed
to
the
landlord
of
the
lyttleton
arms
but
in
any
case
it
became
clear
that
as
long
as
it
lasted
he
could
not
be
expected
to
return
to
work
in
the
meantime
he
took
great
pains
to
avoid
crossing
abner
feeling
less
obligation
towards
the
housekeeping
expenses
from
the
fact
that
his
nourishment
in
these
days
was
mainly
liquid
and
taken
elsewhere
it
was
difficult
to
say
how
long
the
money
would
last
him
for
the
present
he
was
managing
extraordinarily
well
and
there
seemed
no
reason
why
he
should
ever
take
up
work
again
although
there
was
now
no
physical
reason
why
he
should
not
begin
the
summer
passed
without
any
change
in
their
arrangements
abner
still
disliked
his
work
the
prolonged
strain
of
working
in
cramped
positions
was
beginning
to
tell
on
his
eyes
but
in
the
lower
levels
of
the
pit
he
suffered
little
from
the
extremity
of
heat
which
made
work
above
ground
almost
impossible
in
the
july
of
that
year
and
made
his
father
thirstier
than
ever
under
the
new
conditions
he
found
it
impossible
to
save
money
for
the
needs
of
the
day
when
he
should
be
free
all
his
earnings
but
a
few
shillings
went
to
alice
every
saturday
night
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
refrained
from
breaking
into
the
small
store
that
he
had
kept
intact
in
his
stocking
on
august
the
men
at
the
pit
stopped
work
this
was
the
day
of
dulston
wake
the
principal
festival
of
the
year
each
of
the
small
towns
that
lie
like
knots
on
the
network
of
tramways
that
has
its
centre
in
north
bromwich
has
its
own
minor
fair
of
roundabouts
and
shies
but
none
of
these
have
half
the
significance
of
dulston
wake
which
is
prominent
not
only
by
its
magnitude
but
also
by
the
weight
of
tradition
that
belongs
to
it
and
by
the
magnificence
of
its
setting
in
all
his
life
abner
had
never
missed
it
nor
for
that
matter
had
his
father
and
when
the
day
drew
near
it
was
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
whole
family
should
put
on
its
sunday
clothes
and
go
to
the
wake
together
they
left
soon
after
midday
john
fellows
already
mildly
intoxicated
abner
in
his
blue
suit
with
a
white
silk
neckerchief
and
alice
carrying
the
baby
breeched
for
the
occasion
in
her
best
black
costume
they
had
to
walk
more
than
a
mile
from
hackett
s
cottages
to
the
terminus
of
the
electric
tramway
system
that
had
not
yet
come
to
mawne
john
fellows
who
had
forgotten
his
limp
led
the
way
at
a
great
pace
down
mawne
bank
so
fast
indeed
that
alice
grew
tired
by
the
weight
of
the
child
the
day
was
one
of
sweltering
heat
of
the
kind
in
which
the
people
of
the
prefer
to
take
their
pleasures
john
fellows
carried
a
bottle
of
draught
beer
in
each
pocket
of
his
coat
and
a
red
escaped
from
under
the
brim
of
his
bowler
hat
he
turned
to
swear
at
alice
for
delaying
the
progress
of
the
party
and
then
mumbling
something
under
his
breath
put
on
a
spurt
of
ridiculous
energy
and
left
them
behind
abner
relieved
the
panting
alice
of
her
burden
and
carried
the
child
on
his
shoulder
soon
they
had
crossed
the
stour
at
the
bridge
by
the
works
and
had
gained
the
relative
coolness
of
shade
under
the
chestnuts
of
mr
willis
s
hanging
gardens
they
arrived
at
the
tramway
terminus
ten
minutes
later
than
john
fellows
to
find
that
he
had
not
profited
by
his
exertions
since
the
trams
were
overcrowded
and
a
breakdown
had
disorganised
the
service
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
sitting
down
on
the
cinder
path
and
emptying
one
of
his
beer
bottles
and
as
fast
as
he
drank
beer
sweat
oozed
from
every
pore
of
his
body
when
the
tram
appeared
in
the
distance
he
pulled
himself
up
with
a
grunt
and
prepared
to
fight
for
a
seat
in
it
it
was
quite
impossible
for
alice
to
compete
in
this
kind
of
scrimmage
john
fellows
pushed
his
way
in
first
and
sat
fanning
himself
with
his
hat
while
abner
alice
and
the
baby
were
left
behind
they
did
not
see
him
again
during
the
day
they
waited
for
twenty
minutes
in
the
sun
before
they
found
a
place
in
one
of
those
reckless
that
go
roaring
like
spent
shells
through
all
the
wastes
of
the
black
country
they
could
not
speak
for
the
jolt
and
jangle
of
its
progress
for
the
clanging
of
its
bell
and
the
alarming
sputter
of
electric
sparks
when
it
swayed
on
its
springs
and
threatened
to
jump
the
rails
in
all
their
four
miles
of
journey
they
could
see
no
green
they
passed
through
endless
streets
of
grimy
brick
baked
culverts
from
which
a
blast
of
acrid
and
lifeless
air
rushed
through
the
front
of
the
car
like
a
sirocco
even
though
the
fires
of
the
furnaces
and
factories
had
been
banked
down
for
the
holidays
they
could
still
smell
the
heat
which
had
scorched
and
blackened
this
volcanic
country
on
every
side
at
last
they
were
jolted
through
the
narrow
streets
of
dulston
happily
without
catastrophe
and
ejected
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
its
medieval
castle
stands
here
the
crowd
was
at
its
thickest
noisy
hawkers
sold
ticklers
and
leaden
and
programmes
of
the
fête
tram
after
tram
disgorged
its
sweaty
contents
to
mix
with
the
cooler
occupants
of
brakes
and
through
the
dense
foliage
of
the
castle
woods
that
hung
limp
in
the
heat
like
painted
leafage
in
a
theatre
the
discordant
music
of
competing
roundabouts
floated
down
and
beneath
it
one
could
hear
the
low
exciting
rumour
of
the
fair
toward
which
the
steady
stream
of
new
arrivals
was
setting
it
was
a
stiff
pull
up
the
slope
of
the
castle
hill
and
every
one
who
climbed
it
seemed
bitten
with
an
infectious
speed
at
the
top
of
it
the
crowd
thickened
beneath
the
constriction
of
a
narrow
norman
arch
and
then
burst
and
scattered
into
the
huge
central
courtyard
where
gray
ruins
looked
down
upon
this
modern
substitute
for
the
tourneys
of
the
middle
ages
abner
and
alice
were
caught
up
in
the
excitements
of
the
fair
he
soon
added
to
his
burdens
by
knocking
down
three
at
a
to
the
admiration
of
alice
he
smashed
thin
globes
of
glass
spinning
above
a
jet
of
water
for
his
prize
he
chose
a
brooch
of
imitation
gold
a
heart
pierced
by
an
arrow
and
surmounted
by
the
word
she
laughed
and
pinned
it
in
the
neck
of
her
black
bodice
she
marvelled
at
the
sureness
of
his
hand
and
eye
there
was
no
one
in
all
that
crowd
whom
she
would
have
chosen
for
her
escort
rather
than
him
she
rejoiced
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
to
find
him
a
happy
and
natural
companion
only
wishing
that
she
could
forget
the
fact
that
john
fellows
also
was
there
drinking
no
doubt
in
one
of
the
canvas
marquees
that
the
firm
of
astill
had
erected
in
each
corner
of
the
courtyard
once
and
only
once
she
spoke
her
thoughts
i
wonder
where
he
is
abner
she
said
he
only
laughed
at
her
i
ll
find
him
if
you
oh
don
t
be
soft
abner
she
said
i
was
only
wondering
they
spent
their
coppers
at
a
dozen
booths
seeing
the
fattest
lady
and
the
smallest
horse
in
the
world
the
riders
of
bucking
bronchos
with
woolly
trousers
and
slouch
hats
who
were
even
better
shots
than
abner
and
the
lady
of
mystery
who
divined
the
name
and
age
of
alice
and
the
dates
on
abner
s
football
medals
and
told
them
that
their
married
happiness
was
threatened
by
a
dark
woman
to
this
seeress
alice
protested
blushing
abner
was
not
her
husband
well
my
love
said
that
lady
pointing
to
the
baby
that
bain
t
nothing
to
boast
the
crowd
in
the
tent
laughed
and
alice
was
annoyed
with
abner
for
laughing
with
them
you
ought
to
have
told
er
she
said
crossly
as
they
emerged
it
s
enough
to
take
my
character
for
life
by
this
time
the
cause
of
the
mystery
lady
s
speculations
was
getting
tired
and
peevish
abner
took
him
for
a
ride
on
one
of
the
galloping
roundabout
horses
but
the
motion
only
made
him
sick
and
so
they
left
the
courtyard
and
sat
resting
in
the
tepid
air
under
the
shadow
of
the
castle
beeches
undisturbed
by
any
but
casual
lovers
who
had
sought
the
same
kind
of
privacy
i
think
it
s
awful
the
way
they
be
ave
said
alice
hugging
the
baby
to
her
breast
as
though
she
thought
he
might
be
corrupted
by
the
sight
of
so
much
unbridled
passion
it
came
natural
to
her
to
adopt
this
pose
of
modesty
in
abner
s
company
she
expected
him
to
agree
with
her
but
he
only
laughed
and
this
set
her
thinking
of
the
dark
episode
of
susan
wade
and
wishing
she
knew
what
actually
had
happened
you
didn
t
ought
to
laugh
she
said
it
bain
t
but
abner
was
too
contented
to
pursue
the
argument
the
child
slept
for
an
hour
and
abner
sat
smoking
beside
them
he
went
back
to
the
and
brought
her
a
cup
of
tea
thus
refreshed
they
returned
to
the
castle
courtyard
the
sun
was
setting
the
uppermost
storeys
of
the
ruins
were
tinged
with
warm
and
mellow
light
but
the
crowded
space
beneath
them
had
grown
cooler
hissing
flares
of
naphtha
were
lighted
soared
out
of
the
pit
of
the
ruins
into
the
glowing
sky
the
crowd
released
from
the
burden
of
heat
under
which
it
had
laboured
began
to
pluck
up
spirits
there
was
a
good
deal
of
friendly
from
which
alice
shrank
into
the
protection
of
abner
s
bulk
little
john
did
not
seem
much
the
better
for
his
sleep
he
was
tired
and
irritable
and
frightened
by
the
squirts
of
water
and
the
feathered
teasers
it
seemed
as
if
they
would
have
to
take
him
home
but
i
did
want
him
to
see
the
fireworks
alice
said
regretfully
already
two
monstrous
had
ascended
and
drifted
away
till
they
showed
no
bigger
than
the
moon
come
on
then
said
abner
i
ve
had
enough
of
it
if
yo
have
let
s
get
back
before
the
trams
is
he
took
the
baby
from
her
arms
and
she
almost
unwillingly
followed
him
at
the
end
of
the
courtyard
near
the
norman
archway
by
which
they
had
entered
stood
a
inside
which
the
show
was
just
on
the
point
of
beginning
the
proprietor
a
ruffian
in
a
sweater
whose
board
proclaimed
him
to
be
an
champion
of
bermondsey
had
collected
a
crowd
round
his
platform
by
inveighing
in
the
intervals
between
ringing
his
bell
against
the
sporting
reputation
of
the
at
the
back
of
the
platform
two
of
his
staff
a
nigger
and
a
hebrew
were
sparring
gently
like
kittens
at
play
it
seemed
that
the
reason
for
his
resentment
was
his
failure
to
get
the
dulston
audience
to
do
anything
but
watch
him
and
his
pets
what
he
wanted
he
said
was
sport
just
to
see
what
the
local
talent
was
made
of
sport
he
said
you
don
t
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
in
this
ole
when
i
puts
up
this
tent
in
durham
or
middlesborough
or
wales
they
flock
into
it
flock
in
ready
to
take
a
turn
with
the
boys
and
give
a
little
exhibition
frightened
to
use
your
fists
that
s
what
you
are
here
what
the
hell

what

enough
to
make
me
sick
you
people

enough
to
make
me
want
to
take
down
the
saloon
and
burn
the
whole
bleedin
bag
of
tricks
damme
if
it
isn
t
an
the
boys
waiting
here
for
a
bit
of
the
nigger
had
stopped
sparring
and
was
grinning
insolently
at
the
crowd
among
the
younger
women
of
which
his
strangeness
exercised
an
attraction
nobody
however
seemed
inclined
to
enter
the
booth
come
along
abner
alice
whispered
tugging
at
his
arm
the
proprietor
rang
his
bell
again
now
for
the
last
time
he
said
just
commencing
if
you
haven
t
the
spunk
to
put

exhibition

cried

her
arms
come

he
said
i

he
moved
forward
through
the
crowd
alice
clinging
to
him
desperately
tried
to
hold
him
back
but
the
people
made
way
for
him
and
even
helped
him
forward
swarming
up
on
to
the
platform
after
him
garside
pleased
with
the
result
of
his
stratagem
shook
hands

said
thickly
come

disappeared
together
into

tent
sixpences
rattled
into
the
wooden
bowl
that
the
negro
held
to
receive
them

and
women
poured
into
the
booth
anxious
to
see
what
kind
of
battering
the
representative
of
the
district

little
jew
pushed
back
the
crowd
and
held
up
a
piece
of
boarding
with
the
words
house
full
painted
on
it
while
the
negro
fastened
the
strings
of
the
tent
door
alice
was
left
alone
in
the
crowd
outside
clutching
the
baby
nervously
in
her
arms
she
could
not
have
borne
to
see
abner
fight
all
she
could
do
was
to
wait
patiently
outside
and
listen
in
agony
for
any
sounds
within
she
could
hear
very
little
but
the
buzz
of
conversation
even
when
she
crept
round
to
the
side
of
the
tent
and
put
her
ear
to
the
canvas
the
sounds
that
came
to
her
were
indistinct
unreal
and
blurred
by
the
nearer
rumour
of
the
multitude
the
hiss
of
naphtha
flares
the
creaking
of
cracks
of
rifles
and
above
all
the
raucous
blaring
of
the
steam
organs
and
the
shriek
of
their
whistles
if
only
she
could
have
heard
something
she
would
have
been
happier
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
abner
s
white
flesh
being
bruised
and
yet
curiously
enough
she
was
thrilled
and
proud
of
him
her
distaste
for
violence
couldn
t
get
the
better
of
her
exultation
in
her
man
s
virility
she
stood
at
the
side
of
the
tent
tensely
listening
a
rocket
screamed
into
the
sky
there
was
a
moment
of
relative
silence
from
the
crowd
in
which
she
thought
she
heard
a
sound
of
dull
thuds
mingled
with
another
pattering
noise
the
rocket
burst
into
a
shower
of
gold
amid
a
salvo
of
oh
s
the
crowd
noisily
streaming
towards
the
ramparts
from
which
they
could
see
the
fireworks
against
a
blacker
sky
jostled
her
passing
between
the
and
the
next
tent
six
rounds
it
could
not
last
much
longer
why
had
he
left
her
so
roughly
why
hadn
t
he
taken
her
with
him
of
course
you
couldn
t
take
a
baby
into
a
even
a
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
have
pushed
her
aside
like
that
she
wouldn
t
forgive
him
that
roughness
in
a
hurry
but
she
knew
that
she
would
she
would
forgive
abner
anything
as
long
as
he
did
not
disregard
her
the
crowd
still
streamed
past
her
showers
of
starred
rockets
and
tadpoles
of
fire
were
bursting
above
her
in
the
velvet
sky
a
whole
battery
of
maroons
shook
the
ruins
he
would
be
sorry
to
have
missed
the
fireworks
if
he
were
badly
knocked
about
she
still
had
some
of
mrs
moseley
s
ointment
fine
thing
for
bruises
or
broken
skin
that
was
the
night
she
remembered
when
he
had
come
home
drunk
the
night
when
for
a
moment
they
had
gazed
into
each
other
s
eyes
she
knew
how
dangerous
the
emotion
of
pity
was
a
suddenly
sputtered
out
of
the
darkness
letters
of
fire
began
to
form
themselves
what
would
they
say
god
save
the
king
of
course
little
john
began
to
cry
saying
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
bed
yes
my
precious
she
crooned
mammy
ll
take
you
six
rounds
she
suddenly
remembered
how
a
young
pitman
at
mawne
had
once
been
killed
in
a
by
a
blow
on
the
chin
a
blow
she
remembered
old
mr
higgins
talking
of
it
but
abner
was
strong
nothing
of
that
kind
could
possibly
happen
to
him
even
so
she
couldn
t
get
the
sinister
picture
of
budge
garside
with
his
heavy
jowl
out
of
her
head
he
was
such
a
customer
suppose
a
sound
of
cheering
came
from
inside
the
tent
she
ran
round
to
the
front
wishing
to
goodness
that
john
would
hold
his
noise
the
curtains
opened
the
negro
came
out
with
another
signboard
just
people
surged
out
of
the
tent
laughing
and
talking
together
a
bold
girl
burst
out
laughing
in
the
nigger
s
face
alice
took
hold
of
the
sleeve
of
one
of
the
men
who
came
out
alone
and
looked
as
if
he
were
sober
tell
us
what
s
happened
she
gasped
but
he
only
stared
at
her
and
shook
his
head
and
went
on
straight
forward
as
if
he
had
mistaken
her
motive
for
accosting
him
the
tent
emptied
after
a
moment
she
saw
abner
shaking
hands
with
the
giant
in
the
door
he
didn
t
seem
to
notice
her
and
when
he
came
down
the
wooden
steps
and
she
called
his
name
he
did
not
look
pleased
to
see
her
his
lip
was
cut
and
his
forehead
still
damp
from
a
vigorous
sponging
she
took
his
arm
she
wanted
to
show
him
how
glad
she
was
he
was
too
dazed
to
resent
this
familiarity
simply
saying
come
on
out
of
this
in
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
he
stopped
wait
a
jiff
he
said
you
d
better
take
the
two
he
gave
her
the
coins
and
then
suddenly
realising
the
tiredness
of
her
face
in
the
lamplight
asked
her
to
give
him
the
kid
i
reckon
this
is
a
man
s
job
he
said
with
a
deep
laugh
this
time
they
caught
their
tram
without
difficulty
they
spoke
very
little
and
in
whispers
for
john
had
fallen
asleep
in
his
mother
s
arms
and
even
if
he
had
wanted
to
talk
abner
would
have
known
better
than
to
risk
waking
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
taken
a
good
deal
of
punishment
from
garside
s
left
on
points
he
would
have
been
thoroughly
outmatched
and
nothing
but
his
stubborn
will
had
kept
him
on
his
feet
until
the
end
of
the
sixth
round
the
mild
elation
that
had
sustained
him
when
he
left
the
booth
had
now
faded
and
in
its
place
he
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
terrific
hammering
that
he
had
undergone
his
lip
was
beginning
to
swell
and
his
body
felt
cold
in
spite
of
the
sultry
weather
he
dozed
in
the
corner
of
the
and
when
they
came
to
the
terminus
and
alice
roused
him
by
a
touch
on
his
sleeve
he
felt
it
an
unreasonable
effort
to
pull
himself
together
and
carry
the
child
up
mawne
bank
the
creature
was
still
asleep
and
hung
a
dead
weight
on
his
shoulder
rather
than
wake
him
when
they
reached
hackett
s
cottages
alice
carried
him
upstairs
and
laid
him
still
asleep
in
his
cot
when
she
came
downstairs
again
she
found
abner
in
the
washhouse
bathing
his
face
in
cold
water
don
t
do
that
abner
she
said
let
me
see
to
it
she
took
mrs
moseley
s
ointment
and
some
strips
of
linen
from
the
cupboard
but
he
wouldn
t
let
her
touch
him
saying
that
he
was
tired
as
a
dog
and
would
rather
turn
in
she
gazed
at
him
sorrowfully
knowing
that
she
could
not
drive
him
and
fearing
to
persuade
he
rallied
her
weakly
if
you
stand
lookin
at
me
like
that
yo
ll
be
late
for
the
funeral
he
said
and
then
softening
you
look
dead
tired
yourself
put
the
light
out
and
leave
the
door
no
she
said
i
ve
never
done
that
i
shall
wait
up
for
well
you
women
takes
the
biscuit
said
abner
he
left
her
there
and
rolling
up
in
his
blankets
soon
fell
asleep
it
was
not
often
that
he
dreamed
but
on
that
night
his
dreams
would
not
let
him
be
from
the
very
moment
that
he
first
slept
he
seemed
to
be
fighting
fighting
with
budge
garside
on
a
platform
of
creaking
boards
with
a
rope
barrier
round
it
lit
by
hissing
naphtha
flares
every
moment
he
grew
more
exhausted
but
he
had
to
go
on
fighting
in
spite
of
the
violent
jabs
of
garside
s
fist
over
his
heart
the
crowd
in
the
booth
whose
faces
could
not
be
seen
for
tobacco
smoke
were
laughing
at
him
and
this
filled
him
with
an
angry
determination
to
go
through
with
it
the
round
seemed
endless
he
waited
for
the
umpire
s
bell
to
save
him
but
the
umpire
had
vanished
and
now
he
was
fighting
all
three
garside
with
his
broad
shaggy
chest
the
negro
and
the
little
jew
who
skipped
about
like
a
flea
he
hadn
t
bargained
to
take
on
all
three
at
once
but
there
was
nobody
to
whom
he
could
appeal
and
so
he
had
to
go
on
boxing
as
well
as
he
could
in
this
hurricane
of
six
fists
he
thought
of
alice
and
the
baby
whom
he
had
left
outside
if
he
were
knocked
out
as
he
surely
must
be
in
a
moment
she
would
have
to
look
to
herself
that
couldn
t
be
helped
suddenly
he
heard
her
calling
from
outside
the
tent
abner
abner
he
tried
to
call
back
to
her
just
to
show
her
that
he
was
still
keeping
up
but
no
voice
would
come
through
his
cut
lips
garside
landed
a
terrific
blow
on
the
point
of
his
chin
he
woke
he
supposed
he
was
awake
but
the
voice
that
he
had
heard
in
his
dream
still
followed
him
she
was
calling
abner
abner
he
tumbled
out
of
bed
pulled
on
his
trousers
and
ran
downstairs
the
mild
light
of
the
kitchen
dazzled
him
in
the
corner
beyond
a
pile
of
overturned
furniture
he
saw
alice
cowering
and
above
her
john
fellows
in
the
struggle
which
he
had
not
heard
his
father
had
ripped
her
bodice
and
torn
away
the
gilt
brooch
that
abner
had
given
her
now
he
had
her
at
his
mercy
holding
her
by
the
hair
shaking
her
from
time
to
time
like
a
terrier
with
a
rat
and
making
her
scream
with
pain
abner
had
never
seen
such
terror
in
a
human
creature
s
eyes
when
she
saw
him
she
cried
for
his
help
abner
abner
make
him
give
over

to
a
scream

arm

father

he
hit
abner
full
on
his
bruised
mouth
with
all
his
strength
alice
released
ran
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
stood
panting
her
hands
clutching
at
her
torn
bodice
the
baby
started
crying
upstairs
abner
put
his
hand
to
his
mouth
his
lip
was
bleeding
again
he
pulled
himself
together
you

boozed
he
said

he
tried
to
lead
his
father
to
the
door
but
john

not

said
and
what

too
boozed
to

he
launched
a
savage
blow
at
abner
s
face
and
encouraged
by
the
fact
that
abner
did
not
return
it
followed
it
up
with
another
alice
crying
oh
ran
to
the
door
stay
where
yo
are
abner
shouted
john
fellows
closed
with
him
lashing
out
viciously
he
had
been
something
of
a
boxer
in
his
day
and
his
attack
was
so
violent
that
abner
found
it
difficult
to
defend
himself
fellows
fought
like
a
tiger
cat
with
boots
and
and
teeth
his
bloodshot
eyes
were
fixed
on
abner
s
throat
it
was
as
if
all
the
suppressed
malice
of
seven
years
had
been
suddenly
released
then
suddenly
he
dropped
abner
and
flew
at
the
frightened
alice
abner
stopped
him
with
a
blow
under
the
right
ear
he
crumpled
up
and
fell
on
the
floor
like
a
sack
abner
you
ve
done
him
in
alice
cried
he
fell
to
his
knees
and
listened
for
his
father
s
heart
the
impulse
still
fluttered
there
no
he
s
only
stunned
i
reckon
he
ll
wake
up
sober
he
said
alice
stood
trembling
and
sobbing
in
short
gasps
a
strange
mechanical
noise
abner
remained
bent
over
his
father
s
body
in
silence
johnnie
s
crying
bless
his
little
eart
she
said
he
took
no
notice
of

till

she
picked
up
the
alarm
clock
that
fellows
had
knocked
down
from
the
mantelpiece
it
was
still
going
with
a
harsh
metallic
click
it
s
not
two
o
clock
but
he
had
gone
left
alone
she
glanced
fearfully
at
the
form
of
her
husband
for
a
moment
he
lay
quite
still
then
he
shuddered
rolled
over
and
began
to
snore
the
baby
was
still
wailing
upstairs
if
only
john
fellows
had
been
dead
but
that
would
have
been
murder
what
was
abner
doing
she
could
not
live
without
abner
she
went
upstairs
to
his
room
and
tapped
at
the
door
candlelight
glinted
through
cracks
in
the
boards
he
answered
angrily
she
thought
but
she
came
in
what
are
you
doing
now
she
whispered
putting
things
what
s
up
now
i
m
off
out
of
going
she
cried
abner
you
can
t
go
and
leave
me
like
this
not
with
him
he
laughed
i
can
t
take
you
along
with
me
not
likely
he
went
on
pulling
out
clothes
from
his
wooden
box
she
broke
down
altogether
abner
abner
don
t
go
and
leave
me
i
can
t
i
can
t
he
put
on
his
scarf
abner
only
stay
along
with
us
for
a
bit
i
ve
stayed
too
long
as
it
she
tried
to
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
but
he
pushed
her
away
it
s
lucky
i
ve
got
a
bit
of
money
put
by
for
a
start
he
said
fumbling
in
the
mattress
for
his
stocking
i
ll
give
you
what
i
can
then
suddenly
he
swore
violently
he
had
found
the
stocking
but
it
was
empty
he
turned
furiously
on
alice
you
devil
you
took
it
she
fell
at
his
feet
imploring
him
to
believe
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
i
ve
never
told
you
a
lie
abner
she
said
his
rage
made
him
unreasonable
you
re
like
the
rest
on
em
twenty
pounds
what
have
you
done
with
it
i
swear
i
never
seen
a
penny
of
it
abner
it
must
be
there
look
he
had
ripped
the
bed
to
pieces
but
there
was
no
money
suddenly
light
dawned
on
them
both
they
had
found
the
explanation
of
john
fellows
continued
affluence
thinking
of
this
they
could
not
doubt
where
the
money
had
gone
that
s
the
worst
turn
he
ever
done
me
he
said
pulling
on
his
cap
even
now
she
could
not
believe
that
he
was
going
not
till
the
morning
she
said
don
t
leave
me
with
him
like
that
in
the
in
the
kitchen
abner
again
examined
his
father
who
now
appeared
to
be
sleeping
peacefully
he
won
t
remember
a
word
of
it
when
he
wakes
he
said
again
she
implored
him
not
to
leave
her
but
now
she
could
see
that
entreaties
were
useless
and
that
his
mind
was
made
up
it
was
the
most
awful
parting
in
her
life
as
final
and
annihilating
as
death
for
more
than
three
years
she
had
lived
for
him
and
very
little
else
he
opened
the
door
it
was
a
bland
summer
night
the
sky
full
of
soft
stars
and
the
country
of
a
breathing
sweetness
so
long
then
alice
he
said
she
could
not
speak
she
put
up
her
arms
and
kissed
him
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
he
did
not
then
push
her
away
but
she
felt
that
he
was
only
compelling
himself
to
tolerate
her
embrace
i
never
touched
that
money
she
said
hastily
i
know
you
never
did
he
replied
so
long
his
shadow
disappeared
into
the
darkness
she
shut
the
door
of
the
kitchen
john
fellows
lay
on
the
floor
snoring
and
upstairs
the
baby
still
cried
the
eighth
chapter
there
was
no
moon
but
the
sky
even
at
this
early
hour
of
the
morning
was
full
of
a
curious
shimmer
of
light
reflected
from
the
upper
air
clothing
europe
to
eastward
of
the
english
lands
at
that
season
of
the
year
sunlight
was
never
distant
now
every
moment
the
stars
shone
fainter
and
the
slate
roofs
of
the
houses
seemed
to
gather
light
abner
stood
looking
up
and
down
the
stourton
road
he
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
he
was
dazed
by
the
suddenness
with
which
the
freedom
so
long
and
so
patiently
awaited
had
come
to
him
in
the
bewilderment
of
the
moment
he
could
scarcely
even
realise
that
it
was
sweet
he
had
planned
it
differently
and
anticipated
the
day
so
often
that
its
violent
arrival
took
him
off
his
feet
he
had
expected
to
leave
mawne
deliberately
in
his
own
time
and
carrying
his
savings
in
his
pocket
events
had
cast
him
out
violently
and
penniless
not
quite
penniless
for
he
still
had
a
little
change
left
from
the
money
he
had
taken
to
the
wakes
he
remembered
with
regret
that
he
had
been
fool
enough
to
give
alice
the
two
sovereigns
he
had
won
in
the
they
would
have
come
in
handy
but
reflection
told
him
that
alice
would
need
them
a
great
deal
more
than
he
a
man
began
to
cough
in
the
front
bedroom
of
the
house
before
which
he
was
standing
people
upstairs
were
beginning
to
wake
a
cock
crowed
dismally
he
had
better
make
up
his
mind
for
day
was
beginning
eastward
the
stourton
road
led
to
coventry
westward
to
wales
whichever
way
he
went
his
lack
of
money
would
compel
him
to
walk
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
walking
or
for
that
matter
of
sleeping
rough
and
yet
he
felt
that
he
was
at
sea
and
incapable
in
his
present
condition
of
making
up
his
mind
his
head
and
body
ached
with
garside
s
blows
for
the
bruised
muscles
were
beginning
to
stiffen
he
was
sleepy
as
well
as
tired
and
couldn
t
remember
one
thing
that
seemed
to
be
calling
for
recognition
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
went
on
walking
aimlessly
towards
halesby
the
motion
set
his
mind
working
once
more
and
he
remembered
the
thing
that
had
baffled
and
escaped
him
tiger
he
couldn
t
very
well
leave
the
dog
on
mrs
moseley
s
hands
at
the
same
time
he
didn
t
want
to
frighten
the
old
woman
by
disturbing
her
before
daylight
to
do
so
would
entail
explanations
possibly
arguments
on
the
subject
of
his
filial
duties
it
would
mean
another
and
he
wanted
to
get
away
quietly
without
anything
of
that
kind
still
he
meant
to
have
tiger
as
much
for
his
own
comfort
as
for
mrs
moseley
s
he
determined
to
see
what
could
be
done
the
old
woman
s
house
was
the
last
on
the
right
of
a
steep
street
climbing
at
right
angles
to
the
stourton
road
he
turned
up
it
his
raising
stinging
echoes
on
the
stones
he
felt
as
if
he
must
surely
wake
every
one
that
slept
there
mrs
moseley
s
house
was
as
quiet
as
the
rest
he
surveyed
it
strategically
at
the
back
of
it
lay
a
little
yard
that
in
happier
days
had
been
used
as
a
to
advertise
the
presence
of
these
treasures
within
her
husband
had
prevailed
upon
the
landlord
to
top
the
wall
with
fragments
of
broken
bottles
this
barrier
now
confronted
abner
luckily
he
was
tall
enough
to
reach
the
top
of
the
wall
with
his
hands
and
he
soon
discovered
that
time
and
weather
had
taken
the
nature
out
of
mr
moseley
s
mortar
so
that
it
crumbled
easily
and
allowed
him
to
remove
the
glass
from
a
foot
of
the
coping
in
two
minutes
he
had
done
this
straddled
the
wall
and
dropped
down
softly
on
the
other
side
tiger
bad
watchdog
that
he
was
still
slept
abner
came
softly
to
the
door
of
the
washhouse
and
tried
it
there
was
no
fear
that
mrs
moseley
would
leave
a
door
unlocked
at
night
even
behind
a
wall
the
only
other
aperture
in
the
scullery
was
a
window
that
was
too
small
for
him
to
get
through
and
set
very
high
in
the
wall
with
his
thrust
through
a
broken
pane
he
lifted
the
hasp
and
opened
it
tiger
gave
a
sharp
bark
ss
abner
whispered
tiger
good
dog
come
on
tiger
with
a
snuffle
of
recognition
came
out
of
his
hole
and
yawned
the
next
moment
he
was
jumping
up
towards
the
window
anxious
to
get
at
his
master
and
whining
like
a
baby
because
the
window
was
too
high
for
him
time
after
time
he
leapt
and
failed
to
reach
the
sill
the
wall
was
too
smooth
and
the
space
of
the
washhouse
too
cramped
to
give
him
a
run
for
his
jump
he
grew
excited
and
inclined
to
be
noisy
and
at
last
abner
seeing
no
other
way
out
of
the
difficulty
put
his
arm
as
far
as
he
could
through
the
window
and
when
the
dog
jumped
caught
blindly
at
the
loose
skin
of
his
back
and
hauled
him
through
tiger
trembled
with
gratitude
and
the
anticipation
of
new
joys
he
licked
abner
s
face
as
he
lifted
him
up
and
put
him
on
the
top
of
the
coping
he
jumped
over
into
the
road
and
abner
followed
him
a
policeman
attracted
by
the
strange
phenomenon
of
tiger
s
egress
watched
him
as
he
dropped
over
he
was
a
young
man
a
football
player
who
knew
abner
and
when
he
saw
tiger
s
master
emerge
he
grinned
got
him
out
without
waking
the
old
woman
said
abner
rabbits
said
the
other
with
a
wink
abner
laughed
both
of
them
knew
that
the
do
not
run
in
colliery
districts
looks
as
if
e
knows
all
about
it
said
the
constable
at
parting
tiger
was
already
nearly
out
of
sight
sniffing
the
grass
as
he
went
since
abner
went
back
to
work
at
the
pit
he
had
been
deprived
of
hunting
at
this
ideal
hour
it
was
extraordinary
how
tiger
s
company
restored
abner
s
confidence
he
felt
no
longer
alone
and
worried
by
indecision
tiger
had
gone
so
far
that
it
was
useless
to
call
him
back
he
had
chosen
his
own
direction
and
abner
was
content
to
follow
him
what
he
wanted
most
of
all
he
decided
was
a
sleep
beyond
the
level
of
mrs
moseley
s
cottage
the
houses
thinned
away
and
the
ground
fell
steeply
to
the
fields
above
the
stour
the
scene
of
abner
s
walks
with
susan
more
than
a
year
before
dawn
came
heralded
by
no
fierce
splendours
white
light
stealing
from
the
east
over
a
cloudless
sky
the
birds
were
already
awake
but
the
hush
of
august
held
them
so
that
the
warblers
were
silent
larks
there
were
lost
in
the
sunlit
levels
above
the
whiteness
thrushes
made
subdued
domestic
noises
in
the
hedgerows
linnets
already
flocking
for
the
early
harvest
of
seed
rustled
the
hawthorn
thickets
chaffinches
sang
boldly
in
a
more
vulgar
strain
a
soft
air
bloomed
the
drowsy
hedges
elder
blossoms
and
slender
umbels
of
parsley
flower
gleamed
like
dull
ivory
light
and
more
light
came
welling
over
the
world
when
abner
had
reached
the
plank
bridge
over
the
stour
where
susan
first
had
kissed
him
the
edge
of
the
woodland
rose
up
black
beyond
the
stream
the
water
gleamed
beneath
the
alders
and
the
hills
that
had
lain
folded
in
night
lifted
their
heads
now
the
birds
were
silent
only
the
larks
still
sang
walking
behind
the
ecstatic
tiger
through
a
green
lane
in
uffdown
wood
abner
saw
the
peak
of
pen
beacon
before
him
smitten
with
fire
the
sun
was
up
gigantic
shadows
dappled
and
barred
the
grass
tiger
dancing
from
side
to
side
pursued
a
phantom
hound
they
left
the
woods
and
dropped
over
a
stile
into
a
winding
road
as
yet
the
sun
had
no
real
heat
colour
it
warmed
but
the
air
was
cool
cool
and
clean
as
the
surface
of
this
rocky
road
so
often
scoured
by
torrents
the
heavy
odours
of
the
woods
belonged
to
night
but
the
smell
of
the
road
was
one
of
morning
gradually
the
banks
released
the
peculiar
perfume
of
a
in
sunshine
a
lovely
healthy
savour
of
thyme
and
bracken
and
dry
heather
a
breeze
swept
the
harebells
still
they
climbed
the
path
towards
the
top
of
uffdown
where
the
sun
came
first
even
at
this
hour
pods
were
snapping
amid
the
almond
scent
of
late
gorse
blossom
in
the
shadow
of
a
hedge
where
prickles
were
few
abner
threw
himself
down
propping
his
head
on
a
tussock
of
thin
grass
he
closed
his
eyes
and
was
soon
asleep
and
tiger
having
smelt
and
scared
innumerable
rabbits
came
at
last
to
lie
beside
him
propping
his
slender
lower
jaw
upon
the
smooth
of
abner
s
thigh
he
did
not
sleep
for
long
his
watch
had
stopped
and
he
could
not
tell
the
time
but
from
the
height
of
the
sun
he
judged
it
to
be
between
eight
and
nine
o
clock
the
grass
of
that
southern
was
already
warm
and
fragrant
and
the
mistiness
of
the
severn
plain
beneath
him
promised
another
day
of
broiling
heat
he
was
horribly
stiff
and
lay
on
with
a
sense
of
lazy
luxury
letting
the
sun
warm
his
bones
sprawling
there
with
his
eyes
closed
he
now
began
to
consider
where
he
should
go
the
obvious
goal
of
an
in
the
midlands
at
that
time
was
coventry
an
ancient
city
then
rising
on
the
third
of
its
great
industrial
booms
the
manufacture
of
there
was
always
work
and
work
to
be
had
in
coventry
the
journey
was
short
and
abner
had
no
money
to
waste
on
railway
fares
even
so
the
idea
of
merely
moving
from
one
side
of
the
to
another
did
not
seem
to
represent
the
kind
of
radical
change
that
he
had
intended
he
wanted
to
make
a
clean
start
in
a
new
country
it
suddenly
struck
him
that
after
all
there
was
no
real
reason
why
a
man
should
spend
the
whole
of
his
life
in
the
dust
of
coal
and
metal
or
the
smell
of
fire
this
joy
of
sunlight
and
fresh
air
seemed
too
good
to
lose
he
knew
nothing
of
the
conditions
of
labour
in
the
country
beyond
the
fact
that
many
families
migrated
every
autumn
into
the
fields
of
worcestershire
for
the
gathering
of
hops
he
remembered
how
he
had
seen
these
companies
returning
men
women
and
children
together
carrying
their
household
goods
in
old
perambulators
looking
happier
and
more
healthy
than
the
majority
of
halesby
people
he
had
no
very
definite
idea
when
the
hopping
season
began
but
whether
he
were
too
late
for
it
or
too
early
he
knew
at
any
rate
that
he
had
a
store
of
strength
and
health
to
sell
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
work
why
shouldn
t
he
work
in
the
open
air
for
the
summer
at
least
after
that
he
might
go
down
with
the
money
he
had
earned
into
the
welsh
valleys
and
take
to
the
pit
again
he
knew
that
between
him
and
wales
lay
a
vast
green
country
in
which
a
man
might
live
as
well
as
anywhere
else
even
now
the
sun
was
drinking
up
the
mists
that
concealed
it
revealing
sombre
woodlands
heavy
in
leaf
yellow
cornfields
the
smoke
of
hidden
towns
or
villages
and
here
and
there
a
shining
bend
of
river
from
that
high
post
indeed
he
gazed
upon
the
pastoral
heart
of
england
the
most
placid
and
homely
of
all
her
shires
but
the
national
schools
had
taught
him
nothing
of
these
things
and
as
the
mists
ascended
showing
the
cliffs
of
cotswold
long
and
level
bredon
an
island
dome
may
hill
and
malvern
abberley
clee
and
all
the
nearer
hills
of
wales
he
only
knew
that
it
was
green
and
big
and
that
it
promised
freedom
he
decided
on
wales
and
began
to
take
stock
of
his
possessions
counting
the
change
that
remained
in
his
trouser
and
ninepence
ha
penny
in
untying
the
bundle
into
which
he
had
put
a
change
of
socks
and
underwear
he
wished
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
it
that
he
had
changed
into
his
working
clothes
for
it
did
not
seem
right
to
him
to
look
for
work
in
his
sunday
best
he
turned
out
the
pockets
of
the
coat
wondering
what
tokens
of
his
past
life
it
would
disclose
in
the
breast
pocket
to
his
great
surprise
he
found
a
small
packet
of
paper
that
he
couldn
t
account
for
he
opened
it
and
found
that
it
contained
two
sovereigns
he
stared
at
them
incredulously
and
laughed
aloud
alice
must
have
slipped
them
in
when
she
said
to
him
he
felt
suddenly
tender
toward
her
and
immensely
pleased
at
this
striking
turn
in
his
fortunes
he
scraped
out
of
his
side
pocket
some
dry
remnants
of
tobacco
filled
his
pipe
tied
up
his
bundle
whistled
to
tiger
and
set
off
down
hill
leaving
the
brow
of
the
uffdown
between
him
and
the
blackness
of
mawne
it
was
all
new
ground
to
him
the
hills
that
he
was
leaving
behind
formed
a
lip
of
the
saucer
in
which
the
midland
coal
measures
lay
and
their
line
had
always
marked
the
limit
of
abner
s
curiosity
as
boldly
as
they
defined
his
physical
horizon
now
he
was
passing
quickly
to
the
unknown
plain
the
path
grew
rough
and
precipitous
for
a
hundred
yards
it
cut
into
a
plantation
of
larches
fully
grown
his
feet
and
tiger
s
made
no
sound
on
the
drift
of
needles
the
wood
was
dry
warm
fragrant
and
as
quiet
as
a
church
one
would
have
thought
that
no
living
creature
was
there
till
tiger
scented
a
squirrel
and
abner
heard
above
him
the
thin
alarm
note
of
the
from
the
wood
they
crossed
a
stone
stile
into
a
sunless
lane
steeper
even
than
the
path
across
the
hill
for
want
of
traffic
and
now
possessed
by
a
company
of
solemn
foxgloves
this
lane
though
unfrequented
was
the
favourite
of
mr
willis
of
mawne
hall
who
always
called
it
our
little
the
only
thing
that
struck
abner
about
it
was
its
steepness
a
stone
that
he
dislodged
in
his
walking
bounded
on
as
though
it
were
falling
over
the
roof
of
a
house
and
tiger
scuttled
after
it
abner
also
found
that
it
was
easier
to
run
than
to
walk
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
they
came
to
a
deserted
watermill
fed
by
a
stream
that
here
issued
from
the
hills
near
it
stood
a
large
that
had
fallen
from
its
state
of
ease
and
comfort
and
was
now
partly
inhabited
by
a
labouring
family
a
small
boy
was
sitting
playing
with
stones
and
eating
a
crust
on
the
green
in
front
of
the
house
tiger
ran
up
and
sniffed
at
him
and
he
dropped
his
crust
and
ran
screaming
up
the
garden
path
a
pale
woman
with
red
hair
rushed
out
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
comforted
him
with
her
apron
abner
said
to
her
but
she
pulled
the
child
inside
the
door
as
if
she
were
frightened
he
heard
her
bolting
herself
in
and
laughed
for
he
didn
t
realise
what
a
ruffian
he
looked
with
his
bruised
unshaven
face
and
his
swollen
lip
tiger
however
had
the
crust
of
bread
and
was
thankful
he
was
no
less
hungry
than
his
master
down
the
valley
they
passed
a
hundred
yards
below
the
mill
the
trees
receded
and
the
stream
widened
into
a
neglected
fishpond
with
leaves
the
air
was
full
of
glittering
blue
and
the
roadside
littered
and
scorched
by
the
signs
of
an
abandoned
gipsy
encampment
the
fishpond
ended
in
a
patch
where
the
stream
gushed
through
narrow
sluices
into
a
pool
of
brown
clear
water
sunlight
beating
through
the
leaves
above
lit
the
bottom
with
floating
patches
of
golden
brown
showing
the
shadows
of
trout
that
lay
there
gently
swaying
with
their
heads
toward
the
sweet
water
the
coolness
of
this
was
so
alluring
that
abner
stripped
and
washed
the
slippery
sweat
from
his
body
tiger
who
was
used
to
this
kind
of
performance
but
hated
water
watched
him
from
the
bank
when
abner
had
dried
himself
with
his
spare
shirt
they
set
off
again
down
the
sunny
road
he
hoped
that
they
would
soon
come
to
a
village
for
the
bathe
had
only
served
to
sharpen
his
appetite
as
yet
there
were
no
signs
of
human
habitation
but
from
the
fields
that
chequered
the
hills
on
either
side
of
the
road
came
many
country
sounds
the
creaking
of
invisible
the
crack
of
a
whip
the
lowing
of
cattle
and
voices
of
men
that
echoed
in
the
closed
valley
a
little
lower
down
they
met
a
man
riding
bareback
on
a
pony
driving
a
flock
of
sheep
before
him
his
legs
hung
straight
down
so
that
they
nearly
touched
the
ground
tiger
and
the
exchanged
inquiries
but
the
horseman
took
no
notice
of
abner
who
stood
against
the
hedge
while
the
flock
stampeded
past
him
with
frightened
brown
eyes
raising
a
dust
that
was
laden
with
a
hot
smell
of
wool
and
the
farmer
s
man
appeared
to
be
riding
in
a
dream
mechanically
switching
the
pony
s
flanks
with
a
branch
of
hazel
abner
woke
him
by
saying
he
stopped
the
pony
with
a
kick
and
turned
to
look
any
pub
handy
hereabout
abner
asked
him
pub
ay
you
m
close
on
it
ten
minute
ll
bring
you
to
the
barley
abner
had
some
difficulty
in
understanding
him
for
the
language
that
he
spoke
was
not
that
of
mawne
he
thanked
him
then
after
a
long
scrutiny
the
horseman
informed
him
that
the
nearest
workhouses
were
at
bromsgrove
and
kiddy
five
miles
to
the
right
or
left
of
the
inn
said
and
kicked
his
pony
into
an
amble
again
by
that
time
the
sheep
had
long
since
pattered
out
of
sight
but
this
was
an
easy
country
in
which
hurry
had
no
place
it
amused
abner
and
did
not
in
the
least
offend
him
to
be
taken
for
a
tramp
in
a
few
days
but
for
alice
s
final
bounty
he
might
easily
have
become
one
the
labourer
had
made
an
estimate
of
the
distance
of
the
pub
in
accordance
with
his
own
leisurely
way
of
progress
in
less
than
half
the
time
that
he
had
predicted
abner
found
himself
in
front
of
an
old
inn
shadowed
by
an
immense
whose
leaves
already
drooped
with
heat
as
abner
reached
the
door
a
man
whom
he
took
to
be
the
landlord
was
starting
to
drive
off
in
a
yellow
probably
to
some
market
for
a
small
pig
was
netted
in
the
back
of
the
trap
a
big
blowsy
woman
whom
he
called
mother
but
who
appeared
to
be
of
his
own
age
and
was
no
doubt
his
wife
saw
him
off
don
t
forget
emily
s
stays
dad
she
called
he
waved
his
whip
in
answer
and
went
bowling
down
the
road
into
the
sun
the
woman
returned
with
a
sigh
that
sounded
as
if
it
betokened
relief
to
the
wide
steps
where
abner
was
standing
waiting
for
her
she
had
not
seen
him
arrive
and
appeared
not
to
be
pleased
at
the
prospect
when
he
began
to
speak
she
cut
him
short
with
no
the
master
never
gives
anything
we
have
to
make
it
a
rule
on
this
he
had
to
explain
that
he
wasn
t
begging
can
you
give
us
a
bit
of
breakfast
missis
he
said
i
can
pay
for
he
showed
her
one
of
his
sovereigns
she
looked
him
up
and
down
incredulously
and
then
said
come
on
in
and
set
yourself
in
the
tap
better
leave
the
dog
outside
or
my
betsy
ll
have
his
eyes
her
betsy
a
big
black
too
rashly
christened
in
his
first
days
of
innocence
was
already
arching
a
back
more
like
that
of
a
geometer
caterpillar
than
a
cat
she
can
t
abear
them
if
she
don
t
know
them
said
the
landlady
once
she
knows
them
she
ll
lie
in
their
arms
like
a
abner
left
tiger
whining
outside
the
door
and
the
landlady
now
satisfied
that
he
wasn
t
as
rough
as
he
looked
was
heard
shouting
orders
to
emily
in
the
kitchen
a
smell
of
frizzling
bacon
came
down
the
passage
abner
settled
himself
on
an
oak
bench
this
taproom
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
royal
oak
the
floor
was
of
big
uneven
stone
flags
and
all
the
furniture
was
black
and
shiny
with
centuries
of
use
the
place
did
not
smell
as
did
the
halesby
pubs
of
stale
spirits
and
tobacco
it
was
as
sweet
as
they
were
sour
agricultural
almanacs
and
signed
photographs
of
memorable
meets
hung
on
the
walls
and
over
the
mantelpiece
a
number
of
cards
recorded
the
fees
and
procreative
achievements
of
shire
stallions
abner
was
nearly
asleep
when
the
landlady
herself
appeared
with
a
plate
of
bacon
and
eggs
and
a
pot
of
tea
there
now
how
will
that
do
you
she
said
abner
started
to
eat
and
she
sat
and
watched
him
apologising
once
more
for
her
first
reception
we
have
to
be
careful
you
see
what
with
all
this
unemployment
there
seems
to
be
more
tramps
on
the
road
than
ever
there
was
in
winter
they
dies
off
like
the
flies
dad
says
they
come
and
go
with
the
swallers
that
s
a
lovely
bit
of
it
became
evident
from
her
conversation
that
she
was
curious
to
know
what
abner
was
doing
she
could
see
that
his
clothes
were
decent
and
that
he
wore
a
silver
but
hinted
that
she
couldn
t
understand
the
battered
state
of
his
face
he
told
her
that
he
had
had
an
accident
there
now
she
said
they
always
go
in
threes
and
bless
me
if
yours
ain
t
the
third
i
ve
come
across
this
week
have
a
drop
more
tea
poured
which
way
are
you
going
then
if
you
d
been
a
bit
earlier
dad
could
have
give
you
a
abner
told
her
that
he
was
looking
for
work
asked
her
if
she
could
help
him
to
find
it
you
re
not
a
farming
man
she
said
and
it
s
all
farmering
he
told
her
that
he
was
ready
to
turn
his
hand
to
anything
and
she
confessed
a
little
dubiously
that
he
might
possibly
get
some
casual
employment
with
one
of
the
farmers
if
i
was
you
she
said
i
should
go
on
through
chaddesbourne
and
ask
at
mr
cookson
s
the
biggest
employer
round
you
re
a
bit
too
early
for
the
harvest
everything
s
backward
in
these
parts
after
the
bad
he
thanked
her
and
while
she
went
out
to
change
his
sovereign
put
aside
a
hunk
of
bread
and
a
slice
of
bacon
that
he
had
not
eaten
for
tiger
they
parted
cheerfully
and
abner
set
his
face
towards
chaddesbourne
the
heat
of
midday
now
lay
heavy
on
the
land
but
in
this
wooded
one
might
always
be
certain
of
shade
in
half
an
hour
he
came
to
chaddesbourne
a
village
of
black
and
white
half
timber
that
was
already
engaged
in
the
midday
coma
with
which
it
supplements
its
normal
sleep
of
centuries
in
all
the
length
of
the
street
abner
saw
no
human
person
stirring
nor
any
sign
of
life
more
violent
than
that
of
lazy
butterflies
sunning
their
wings
upon
the
yellow
flowers
in
cottage
gardens
all
the
houses
had
long
strips
in
front
of
them
behind
which
it
seemed
to
be
intended
that
they
should
sleep
for
ever
in
security
in
a
sandstone
church
some
one
was
playing
the
organ
abner
had
no
ear
for
music
and
so
he
did
not
stop
to
listen
at
the
end
of
the
village
he
heard
a
more
welcome
sound
the
clinking
of
a
blacksmith
s
hammer
on
his
anvil
and
the
hoarse
wheezing
of
bellows
it
was
very
different
from
mawne
with
its
vast
hydraulic
presses
but
it
showed
the
same
process
on
a
small
scale
and
the
smith
in
his
leather
apron
working
through
the
heat
of
the
day
with
the
sweat
tracking
through
his
was
more
like
a
man
of
abner
s
own
race
than
the
labourer
in
the
lane
he
seemed
glad
of
an
excuse
to
stop
work
and
talk
to
abner
he
offered
him
a
drink
of
beer
from
a
bottle
drank
himself
and
wiped
the
froth
from
his
red
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand
looking
for
work
he
said
well
i
can
tell
you
straight
chaddesbourne
s
the
wrong
place
for
that
not
even
at
harvest
time
you
see
this
is
a
dairy
country
properly
speaking
all
the
milk
s
drove
to
the
station
and
sent
into
brum
by
train
mr
cookson
yes
mr
cookson
s
a
very
nice
gentleman
as
every
one
knows
but
i
reckon
he
won
t
be
harvesting
for
another
fortnight
being
still
there
s
no
harm
in
he
pulled
on
his
coat
and
put
a
padlock
on
the
door
of
the
forge
for
his
home
was
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
away
in
one
of
the
cottages
he
said
to
abner
cheerily
and
gave
him
directions
for
finding
mr
cookson
if
i
was
you
he
said
i
should
cut
across
the
fields
behind
the
house
it
ll
save
you
some
sweating
on
a
day
like
this
third
gate
on
the
right
and
follow
along
the
hedge
on
your
left
abner
took
his
advice
and
calling
tiger
to
follow
him
entered
the
field
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
on
the
he
could
see
the
red
roof
of
the
building
that
the
smith
had
pointed
out
to
him
as
cookson
s
farm
tiger
was
in
his
element
he
had
never
been
in
a
field
more
rich
in
rabbit
smell
abner
following
the
smith
s
directions
kept
to
the
hedge
on
the
left
it
ran
along
the
margin
of
a
little
wood
that
sheltered
him
from
the
sun
and
intrigued
tiger
with
prospects
of
infinite
sport
it
was
impossible
to
keep
the
brute
to
heel
and
though
abner
cursed
him
till
he
came
out
of
the
wood
he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
running
ahead
of
his
master
sniffing
the
enchanted
air
suddenly
at
the
corner
where
the
spinney
ended
he
stood
stock
still
abner
also
stopped
and
watched
him
for
he
too
scented
sport
there
was
a
slight
rustle
in
the
hedgerow
and
a
white
creature
a
little
bigger
than
a
stoat
put
out
its
head
in
a
second
tiger
had
it
by
the
neck
and
silenced
its
squealing
with
a
shake
the
next
moment
the
owner
of
the
ferret
appeared
round
the
corner
of
the
hedge
a
florid
man
of
forty
dressed
in
a
prosperous
greenish
cord
carrying
a
gun
he
fired
at
tiger
who
stood
looking
curiously
at
the
ferret
as
though
he
still
expected
it
to
get
up
and
run
away
tiger
rolled
over
without
a
yelp
and
abner
ran
straight
at
the
man
who
had
shot
him
what
you
done
to
my
dog
he
cried
and
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
here
you
poaching
blackguard
he
saw
how
ugly
abner
looked
keep
clear
or
i
ll
put
the
other
barrel
in
you
a
labourer
slouched
round
the
hedgeside
and
picked
up
the
ferret
pinching
it
as
if
he
were
appraising
its
value
as
an
article
of
food
then
mumbling
something
he
thrust
it
into
a
sack
that
he
carried
and
gave
the
dead
body
of
tiger
a
vicious
kick
abner
would
have
flown
at
him
for
he
needed
something
on
which
to
vent
his
rage
but
mr
cookson
again
threatened
to
shoot
he
had
to
content
himself
with
cursing
the
farmer
for
his
brutality
the
dog
didn
t
mean
no
harm
he
said
you
m
a
coward
to
shoot
a
dog
like
not
so
fast
my
friend
said
the
farmer
i
ve
not
finished
with
you
yet
i
want
to
know
what
the
devil
you
were
doing
skulking
along
my
hedge
thought
you
d
pick
up
a
rabbit
eh
i
know
that
game
taking
the
dog
a
walk
what
were
you
doing
on
my
land
eh
i
m
lookin
for
work
said
abner
and
you
look
like
getting
it
i
don
t
suppose
it
s
the
first
time
you
ll
have
picked
abner
did
not
hear
these
words
he
thought
only
of
the
shattered
heap
of
flesh
that
had
once
been
tiger
he
would
have
gone
blindly
for
the
dog
s
murderer
if
he
had
not
suddenly
realised
that
his
own
case
was
hopeless
the
owner
of
the
gun
looked
like
business
and
the
labourer
was
now
ready
to
tackle
him
from
behind
he
could
do
nothing
mr
cookson
however
having
caught
a
poacher
didn
t
mean
to
let
him
go
i
ve
had
enough
of
this
game
he
said
you
chaps
think
you
can
slip
over
the
hills
and
do
what
you
like
you
and
your
dogs
it
s
no
use
turning
ugly
now
you
ll
come
along
with
me
to
the
police
station
and
that
s
all
about
it
that
s
the
best
ferret
i
ve
got
worth
a
dozen
of
your
damned
abner
who
saw
that
it
was
not
worth
while
arguing
and
whose
anger
had
now
become
more
subject
to
his
reason
tried
to
explain
once
more
that
he
was
coming
to
the
house
to
ask
for
work
that
s
an
old
tale
said
cookson
we
ve
had
enough
talk
come
along
that
don
t
explain
what
you
were
doing
in
this
the
farmer
also
was
now
becoming
more
reasonable
abner
explained
that
he
had
taken
the
on
the
smith
s
advice
if
you
can
t
credit
it
you
ask
him
he
said
it
was
the
lady
at
the
barley
mow
sent
me
here
and
give
me
your
name
that
is
if
your
name
s
that
s
my
name
right
enough
said
the
farmer
and
you
won
t
forget
it
he
began
to
grumble
at
the
landlady
as
the
prime
cause
of
his
losing
the
ferret
none
the
less
he
now
appeared
to
believe
abner
at
the
root
he
was
a
man
celebrated
for
the
sudden
violence
and
quick
subsidence
of
his
temper
want
work
do
you
he
said
well
i
ve
got
no
work
for
you
nor
no
one
else
and
if
you
see
mrs
potter
again
you
can
tell
her
so
what
that
woman
wants
to
do
using
my
name
i
don
t
know
i
reckon
i
m
feeding
half
chaddesbourne
as
it
is
still
i
m
ready
to
believe
you
if
you
take
my
advice
you
ll
clear
quick
before
i
change
my
mind
go
on
hook
it
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
jingled
some
money
as
if
he
were
debating
whether
he
should
give
abner
half
a
crown
what
about
my
dog
said
abner
mr
cookson
took
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket
and
his
neck
flushed
i
ve
told
you
you
d
best
clear
he
said
george
ll
bury
the
he
turned
to
the
labourer
george
you
go
up
to
the
yard
and
get
a
he
ejected
the
unused
cartridge
from
his
gun
and
turned
his
back
on
abner
and
abner
still
sore
with
resentment
took
his
advice
and
returned
to
the
road
the
ninth
chapter
in
the
first
moment
of
his
loss
he
did
not
feel
like
retracing
his
steps
when
he
reached
the
main
road
he
turned
his
face
westward
once
more
and
set
off
walking
as
hard
as
the
heat
would
allow
him
he
passed
through
a
land
of
almost
monotonous
green
stopping
once
or
twice
to
drink
a
pint
of
beer
at
a
pub
in
one
of
the
many
villages
that
straggled
along
the
road
in
the
afternoon
he
reached
a
crest
crowned
with
a
plantation
of
smooth
trunked
beeches
from
which
he
could
see
the
chimneys
of
an
industrial
town
this
he
decided
must
be
kidderminster
or
as
the
farmer
s
man
had
called
it
kiddy
once
or
twice
in
his
life
he
had
played
football
there
for
mawne
united
but
in
these
excursions
he
had
never
noticed
anything
but
the
squalid
streets
between
the
station
and
the
football
ground
there
was
a
workhouse
in
kidderminster
as
he
had
been
told
but
he
was
not
yet
in
need
of
workhouses
the
landlord
of
the
last
inn
had
found
out
that
he
was
going
into
wales
and
had
pointed
out
to
him
the
rampart
of
the
malverns
in
the
heat
as
marking
the
course
of
his
road
the
idea
of
finding
employment
in
the
country
now
pleased
him
little
the
sooner
he
reached
the
coal
valleys
with
the
remains
of
his
money
the
better
from
his
new
point
of
vantage
the
hills
were
still
visible
floating
like
cragged
islands
in
the
haze
he
left
the
smoke
of
kidderminster
on
his
right
hand
and
forsook
the
road
for
a
narrower
lane
that
seemed
to
run
in
the
direction
that
he
wanted
to
follow
when
evening
came
he
was
still
walking
now
the
malverns
whenever
he
saw
them
were
etched
black
against
a
background
of
flame
the
air
was
cool
and
sweeter
it
was
such
an
evening
as
tiger
would
have
loved
and
his
loneliness
which
had
been
numbed
by
the
heat
returned
to
him
he
must
by
this
time
have
walked
more
than
twenty
miles
since
daybreak
and
he
was
tired
and
hungry
soon
after
sunset
he
turned
in
to
an
inviting
that
stood
alone
on
a
straight
length
of
road
running
between
meagre
the
landlord
was
an
aged
man
crippled
with
rheumatism
who
sat
grasping
two
sticks
in
a
chair
beside
the
hearth
of
the
taproom
he
looked
suspiciously
at
abner
and
told
his
daughter
an
angular
woman
of
forty
who
did
all
the
housework
to
attend
to
him
this
woman
gave
him
clearly
to
understand
that
they
didn
t
like
strangers
and
said
that
they
could
give
him
nothing
to
eat
but
bread
and
cheese
he
accepted
this
gratefully
and
settled
down
to
his
supper
under
the
grudging
eyes
of
the
old
man
the
inn
seemed
a
lonely
and
neglected
place
for
the
road
on
which
it
was
situate
had
fallen
into
disuse
abner
however
was
glad
of
a
rest
and
sat
on
smoking
and
drinking
beer
for
the
good
of
the
house
when
he
had
finished
his
supper
the
ale
was
good
and
put
him
in
a
happier
frame
of
mind
so
that
he
no
longer
found
the
silence
of
the
old
man
uncomfortable
a
little
later
a
number
of
drifted
in
and
ordered
their
quarts
a
solemn
and
gloomy
company
who
spoke
little
and
in
a
language
that
abner
did
not
understand
he
tried
to
put
some
life
into
them
by
standing
treat
but
even
this
order
did
not
arouse
the
least
enthusiasm
in
the
landlord
s
daughter
who
might
reasonably
have
felt
that
things
were
looking
up
or
in
the
company
these
people
were
silent
drinkers
who
sat
in
pairs
taking
alternate
swigs
from
the
quart
pot
that
stood
between
them
they
looked
upon
abner
this
stranger
from
beyond
the
hills
as
peaceful
border
farmers
might
have
regarded
a
northern
marauder
they
drank
his
beer
but
that
was
all
that
they
could
do
for
him
the
light
failed
but
no
lamp
was
lit
in
the
taproom
and
one
by
one
the
customers
bade
the
landlord
and
stole
away
like
shadows
the
woman
put
her
head
into
the
room
from
time
to
time
as
if
she
hoped
to
find
that
he
was
gone
and
the
old
man
sat
by
the
fireplace
saying
nothing
abner
was
sleepy
and
when
she
next
appeared
asked
her
if
she
could
find
him
a
bed
anything
ll
do
for
me
he
said
i
can
shake
down
anywhere
you
for
the
first
time
since
abner
had
seen
her
she
was
really
positive
we
never
do
such
a
thing
do
we
father
she
cried
the
old
man
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
her
i
bain
t
one
to
make
trouble
abner
said
she
wagged
her
head
violently
we
never
do
such
a
thing
she
repeated
she
shook
the
old
man
s
shoulder
father
e
says
e
wants
to
sleep
ere
we
don
t
sleep
no
strangers
said
he
we
don
t
sleep
no
one
not
in
a
solitary
place
like
this
you
d
best
be
goin
young
man
time
to
lock
up
time
to
lock
abner
asked
him
where
he
could
go
but
neither
of
them
seemed
inclined
to
help
him
they
knew
of
no
house
that
would
take
strangers
and
the
nearest
village
harverton
priors
was
more
than
three
miles
away
even
if
he
went
there
they
said
it
was
unlikely
that
he
would
be
taken
in
we
m
not
accustomed
to
strangers
these
parts
the
woman
kept
on
saying
she
followed
him
like
an
anxious
but
impotent
dog
edging
him
away
from
the
counter
as
if
she
thought
he
had
designs
on
the
till
he
bought
an
ounce
of
tobacco
and
departed
when
she
had
got
him
out
of
the
door
he
heard
a
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
this
taciturn
person
beginning
to
talk
fast
in
an
excited
whisper
to
the
old
man
in
the
corner
abner
laughed
thanks
to
the
excellence
of
their
beer
he
was
at
peace
with
the
world
by
this
time
he
was
getting
used
to
finding
himself
an
object
of
suspicion
he
determined
to
give
harverton
priors
a
miss
for
at
this
time
of
night
it
was
probable
that
the
whole
village
would
be
asleep
and
to
turn
in
for
the
night
in
the
first
isolated
barn
that
he
found
failing
that
there
was
no
reason
why
he
shouldn
t
sleep
in
a
dry
ditch
his
father
had
often
done
so
unintentionally
and
so
far
seemed
none
the
worse
for
it
a
mile
or
more
from
that
inhospitable
inn
he
saw
the
kind
of
building
for
which
he
was
looking
standing
in
a
field
on
the
left
of
the
road
it
was
a
barn
like
the
houses
of
the
neighbourhood
a
group
of
cows
lay
ruminating
in
their
sleep
on
the
far
side
of
it
and
abner
picked
his
way
between
their
shadowy
shapes
to
a
doorway
with
an
oak
beam
for
lintel
a
rough
door
closed
the
aperture
at
first
he
thought
that
it
was
locked
or
bolted
but
it
yielded
to
his
pressure
he
half
expected
to
find
some
animal
inside
for
when
he
first
came
to
the
door
he
had
heard
a
noise
like
a
calf
turning
in
straw
he
struck
a
match
carefully
the
place
was
clean
and
dry
half
filled
with
hay
of
the
last
season
s
harvest
that
had
evidently
been
placed
there
for
winter
fodder
he
decided
that
the
rustling
that
he
had
heard
must
have
been
made
by
rats
well
rats
wouldn
t
worry
him
in
his
present
degree
of
tiredness
he
closed
the
door
and
sank
down
easily
into
a
soft
bed
he
lay
still
on
his
back
with
his
eyes
wide
open
staring
into
the
darkness
above
him
thinking
of
the
extraordinary
variety
of
adventures
that
had
filled
the
last
hours
this
time
last
night
he
reflected
he
must
have
been
dozing
in
the
corner
of
the
between
dulston
and
mawne
now
he
had
nothing
left
to
remind
him
of
his
old
life
except
the
clothes
he
was
wearing
not
even
tiger
he
wondered
what
his
father
was
feeling
like
now
wondered
what
had
happened
to
alice
he
had
never
before
thought
so
tenderly
of
her
she
had
shown
what
she
was
made
of
when
she
slipped
the
two
sovereigns
into
his
pocket
when
he
got
work
in
wales
he
decided
he
would
send
her
money
not
that
she
would
really
need
it
for
now
sheer
necessity
would
compel
john
fellows
to
go
back
to
the
pit
unless
indeed
he
had
any
of
the
money
left
that
he
had
stolen
from
abner
the
thought
of
his
savings
suddenly
reminded
him
what
a
fool
he
had
been
not
to
search
his
father
s
pockets
before
he
left
the
house
on
the
whole
he
wasn
t
sorry
that
he
had
left
him
undisturbed
he
didn
t
feel
unkindly
toward
him
for
he
recognised
that
no
man
is
responsible
for
what
he
says
or
does
when
he
is
drunk
in
the
people
who
know
the
rougher
side
of
life
are
always
ready
to
condone
crimes
of
passion
or
liquor
the
old
chap
s
welcome
to
the
money
abner
thought
leastwise
if
any
of
it
comes
our
alice
s
his
mind
was
still
too
crowded
for
sleep
he
thought
he
would
have
a
smoke
and
began
to
fill
his
pipe
with
the
tobacco
he
had
bought
earlier
in
the
evening
again
he
heard
a
rustling
noise
in
the
hay
when
he
lit
his
pipe
he
would
try
to
see
what
caused
it
he
waited
listening
and
when
next
he
heard
it
struck
a
match
and
peered
in
the
direction
from
which
it
came
douse
that
light
mate
said
a
voice
almost
at
his
elbow
and
take
your
bloody
feet
off
my
chest
you
ll
be
afther
settin
the
place
alight
and
sending
the
both
of
us
to
hell
before
our
time
abner
dropped
his
match
with
astonishment
the
other
suddenly
materialising
put
his
foot
on
the
glowing
fragment
i
reckon
you
give
me
a
bit
of
a
start
said
abner
laughing
start
is
it
it
s
finished
we
ll
be
if
you
go
throwing
that
way
into
a
heap
of
the
turn
of
speech
amused
abner
it
s
easy
to
see
that
you
don
t
know
the
way
to
travel
or
you
wouldn
t
be
doing
the
like
of
that
said
his
unseen
companion
i
may
well
be
stranded
to
the
world
but
it
s
not
burning
i
want
this
night
of
our
lord
i
m
tellin
he
settled
down
into
the
hay
again
this
time
at
some
distance
from
abner
abner
had
never
yet
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
he
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
old
or
young
or
villainous
but
he
knew
that
the
stranger
was
the
first
person
who
had
accepted
him
without
question
since
his
wanderings
began
he
no
longer
felt
sleepy
and
was
indeed
glad
of
a
chance
to
talk
with
another
human
being
in
this
at
any
rate
his
shadowy
companion
was
ready
to
oblige
him
taking
the
conversation
into
his
own
hands
without
the
least
hesitation
he
asked
abner
where
he
had
come
from
and
how
long
he
had
been
on
the
road
god
help
me
he
said
you
re
not
born
yet
then
he
asked
abner
if
he
could
spare
him
a
gorm
abner
had
not
the
least
idea
what
a
gorm
was
but
the
voice
explained
that
it
meant
a
little
weeny
dooney
bit
of
for
to
chew
he
explained
we
don
t
want
anny
more
fireworks
anny
more
for
annimore
as
the
guard
abner
gave
him
his
gorm
deciding
that
the
owner
of
the
voice
whatever
he
looked
like
was
a
they
drifted
into
a
discussion
of
abner
s
adventures
during
the
day
the
owner
of
the
voice
who
in
the
course
of
conversation
proclaimed
himself
to
be
a
certain
mick
connor
usually
known
as
kerry
mick
had
apparently
followed
much
the
same
track
as
abner
he
had
been
refused
refreshment
at
the
barley
mow
and
taken
a
dismal
pint
from
the
hands
of
the
landlord
s
daughter
at
the
second
inn
whose
nose
he
said
would
poke
a
ragman
over
a
double
ditch
he
listened
more
seriously
to
abner
s
account
of
tiger
s
death
you
re
after
losin
a
good
friend
he
said
and
after
a
moment
of
silence
in
which
his
jaws
could
be
heard
masticating
his
gorm
embarked
on
a
long
story
of
his
own
youth
i
ll
tell
you
something
quare
he
said
it
had
happened
more
than
twenty
years
ago
in
the
county
of
was
none
the
the
very
first
situation
that
mick
connor
had
ever
taken
there
was
money
in
ireland
them
days
he
said
the
country
s
gone
to
the
dogs
ever
sence
the
boer
he
was
engaged
as
at
six
pounds
a
year
and
a
suit
of
clothes
and
he
earned
it
by
cleaning
thirty
lamps
and
a
dozen
pair
of
shoes
every
morning
before
breakfast
and
waiting
at
in
the
servants
hall
the
rest
of
the
day
he
spent
in
dodging
the
butler
an
ould
devil
with
a
lip
would
trip
a
duck
who
liked
his
pint
more
than
most
and
used
to
threaten
to
take
the
skin
off
of
him
with
a
twig
whenever
he
saw
him
the
story
seemed
to
lead
nowhere
but
mick
connor
s
voice
was
low
and
persuasive
and
he
evidently
liked
talking
abner
lay
and
listened
even
in
those
early
days
mick
connor
had
been
used
to
the
open
air
he
hated
he
said
and
would
often
go
off
and
hide
himself
under
the
table
a
place
of
concealment
which
the
butler
at
last
discovered
to
cry
he
would
stand
at
the
pantry
windows
looking
out
over
the
fields
to
the
river
where
the
third
footman
was
already
enjoying
himself
catching
eels
and
perch
in
the
holes
the
house
was
a
prison
to
him
the
only
friend
that
ever
came
to
him
from
outside
it
was
a
wolfhound
who
slept
in
the
stables
but
with
whom
he
had
made
great
friends
ever
since
he
had
been
in
the
house
by
feeding
it
with
scraps
from
the
pantry
the
butler
hated
dogs
and
this
dog
above
all
others
because
it
had
once
stolen
a
ham
mick
loved
it
and
fed
it
regularly
it
used
to
jump
up
to
the
pantry
window
and
lick
his
face
through
the
bars
when
he
had
been
in
this
place
for
a
year
or
more
the
family
moved
for
the
summer
to
another
house
on
the
coast
some
thirty
miles
away
for
mick
it
was
a
happy
change
he
and
his
friend
the
third
footman
were
chosen
to
go
there
and
the
savage
butler
was
left
behind
there
were
no
railways
in
that
part
of
ireland
and
so
they
went
to
coulagh
by
road
the
children
were
to
follow
with
their
nurse
the
next
day
so
the
footman
and
the
cook
preceded
them
in
a
wagonette
loaded
with
luggage
they
went
slowly
and
behind
them
walked
mick
leading
two
pannier
asses
named
haidee
and
mokie
on
which
the
children
would
go
for
rides
by
the
shore
they
started
late
and
the
last
part
of
their
journey
was
made
in
the
dark
the
cook
who
had
a
drop
taken
was
telling
ghost
stories
fitting
to
that
wild
hour
and
place
there
was
one
tale
in
particular
of
how
she
had
met
the
devil
in
the
flesh
sitting
by
a
milestone
near
coulagh
three
years
before
that
made
mick
afraid
to
look
on
either
side
of
him
he
walked
with
haidee
on
his
right
and
mokie
on
his
left
and
the
tail
of
the
wagonette
in
front
of
him
and
even
then
he
didn
t
feel
safe
when
they
came
to
coulagh
in
the
darkness
they
had
a
grand
supper
but
even
in
the
cheerful
firelight
mick
couldn
t
forget
the
details
of
the
cook
s
encounter
with
the
devil
the
house
was
small
and
it
had
been
settled
that
he
as
the
least
important
member
of
the
party
should
sleep
in
a
little
room
above
the
stable
in
which
the
asses
were
housed
he
was
thankful
that
the
animals
were
there
for
otherwise
he
would
have
gone
mad
with
the
loneliness
when
he
reached
the
stable
he
went
into
the
stall
and
talked
to
them
and
got
on
the
two
of
their
backs
sitting
first
on
one
and
then
on
the
other
the
way
they
wouldn
t
be
jealous
then
he
patted
their
necks
rubbed
their
noses
and
went
up
the
wooden
stairs
to
bed
he
undressed
got
into
bed
and
put
out
his
candle
but
he
couldn
t
sleep
partly
because
the
room
was
so
strange
after
the
cook
s
stories
and
partly
because
a
wind
was
blowing
fit
to
bring
the
house
down
all
of
a
sudden
the
wind
fell
and
in
the
quiet
he
could
hear
another
sound
like
a
door
banging
and
the
rattle
of
chains
he
supposed
he
had
not
fastened
the
stable
latch
but
even
if
the
asses
got
their
ends
of
cold
he
didn
t
dare
to
put
his
nose
out
of
bed
but
the
noise
of
bumping
and
chains
continued
even
when
he
put
his
head
under
the
clothes
he
could
still
hear
it
i
can
hear
it
the
way
i
am
now
he
told
abner
a
great
rattlin
t
udding
noise
i
commenced
to
get
terrible
afraid
something
s
surely
coming
now
i
thought
god
help
me
and
it
came
on
bumping
and
rattling
up
the
stairs
this
is
the
devil
says
i
let
loose
on
me
an
when
i
put
my
head
under
the
clothes
what
should
i
see
but
all
the
things
i
d
ever
done
in
this
life
all
the
birds
i
d
took
the
heads
of
off
with
a
catapult
flittin
about
with
no
heads
and
the
wings
broke
on
them
and
all
the
bottles
of
whisky
i
d
ever
stolen
on
the
butler
an
the
noise
come
bumping
upstairs
god
i
m
gone
i
says
getting
down
middleways
in
the
bed
and
with
the
same
there
was
a
great
t
ud
and
the
door
flew
open
on
me
and
it
come
into
the
room
bump
bump
bump
it
went
an
the
chairs
went
over
and
the
basin
of
water
i
d
never
washed
in
come
down
with
a
i
lying
there
with
the
pespiration
running
down
me
on
to
the
sheets
like
a
spout
god
i
m
gone
i
says
again
and
that
was
the
last
word
i
spoke
that
night
for
the
sheets
was
stuck
to
me
back
then
it
comes
over
to
the
bed
and
i
tries
to
get
under
the
mattress
but
before
i
knew
where
i
was
i
felt
two
great
hands
on
the
both
of
my
thighs
now
i
m
destroyed
altogether
says
i
but
before
i
d
finished
thinking
it
come
on
the
top
of
me
in
a
lump
with
the
chain
draggin
along
the
floor
and
me
lyin
there
not
as
thick
as
a
match
then
i
commenced
to
feel
the
sheet
being
drew
down
over
my
face
and
two
hairy
arms
round
my
neck
and
with
that
a
great
big
hot
tongue
licking
me
ah
my
beautiful
says
i
i
have
you
at
that
dog
was
so
fond
on
me
he
d
smelt
me
out
over
thirty
miles
and
pulled
the
log
he
was
tied
to
in
the
stable
after
him
and
broke
down
the
door
and
come
upstairs
into
bed
with
me
i
loved
that
dog
and
that
s
why
i
say
you
re
after
losin
a
good
friend
in
yours
give
me
the
lend
of
another
gorm
to
go
to
sleep
abner
gave
him
the
tobacco
and
after
that
the
was
silent
falling
asleep
abner
heard
only
the
regular
noise
of
his
companion
s
jaws
as
they
chewed
in
half
an
hour
they
were
both
asleep
early
next
morning
mick
connor
woke
him
telling
him
that
unless
they
cleared
out
the
farmer
s
men
would
find
them
abner
was
far
too
comfortable
for
the
moment
to
want
to
move
but
as
soon
as
he
regained
full
consciousness
he
realised
that
his
skin
was
itching
all
over
this
place
is
alive
with
fleas
he
said
his
companion
only
laughed
that
s
all
you
know
about
it
he
said
and
the
both
of
us
eat
with
hayseeds
i
m
after
telling
you
somethin
never
choose
hay
to
sleep
in
if
you
can
fin
straw
it
s
worse
than
a
houseful
of
abner
was
curious
to
see
the
owner
of
last
night
s
voice
and
the
teller
of
stories
he
found
it
difficult
to
fit
in
the
man
with
his
narration
it
was
impossible
to
guess
his
age
but
his
hair
was
slightly
touched
with
gray
and
stood
up
in
a
frizzy
mass
that
made
him
look
wilder
than
he
was
he
was
of
middle
height
thin
and
very
wiry
with
a
small
head
bright
eyes
like
a
bird
and
a
bony
face
in
which
the
skin
over
the
cheekbones
was
netted
with
red
veins
his
eyes
were
blue
and
humorous
or
savage
as
the
occasion
took
him
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
he
did
not
appear
anxious
to
talk
and
his
voice
that
had
been
soft
and
persuasive
in
the
darkness
was
rough
and
short
they
left
the
barn
together
the
cows
were
still
sleeping
outside
and
a
dew
was
on
the
grass
but
the
moisture
had
not
fallen
on
the
road
which
seemed
as
baked
and
dusty
as
ever
which
ways
are
you
going
the
irishman
asked
going
to
wales
said
abner
then
the
two
of
us
had
better
travel
together
he
said
and
abner
consented
they
walked
for
some
miles
in
silence
mick
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
was
not
disposed
to
talk
he
went
on
ahead
with
a
long
loping
gait
very
different
from
the
tramp
s
habitual
shuffle
they
came
to
a
brick
bridge
that
proclaimed
itself
unsuitable
for
traction
engines
and
here
he
suddenly
climbed
the
hedge
and
started
to
wash
himself
in
a
bed
of
cresses
he
took
out
the
broken
end
of
a
comb
and
smoothed
his
wet
hair
close
to
his
head
like
a
picture
of
the
madonna
the
water
took
the
gray
out
of
it
so
that
he
looked
almost
young
abner
also
washed
and
when
he
had
picked
the
irritating
hayseeds
out
of
his
shirt
he
offered
his
companion
half
of
a
piece
of
bread
that
remained
in
his
pocket
mick
took
it
without
a
word
and
dipped
it
in
the
water
without
this
soaking
he
could
not
have
tackled
it
for
though
his
bristling
moustache
concealed
the
fact
he
had
scarcely
any
teeth
eating
this
breakfast
together
they
sprawled
on
the
bank
of
the
stream
among
rushes
with
which
abner
amused
himself
by
stripping
the
pith
with
his
nails
his
silent
and
melancholy
companion
broke
the
silence
by
asking
him
if
he
had
any
money
immediately
abner
was
suspicious
his
second
sovereign
and
all
his
silver
were
secreted
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
had
placed
them
there
in
the
night
as
soon
as
he
realised
that
he
was
not
sleeping
alone
in
answer
to
his
friend
s
question
he
produced
a
handful
of
coppers
tenpence
ha
penny
he
said
that
won
t
go
houly
sufferings
said
the
other
is
it
carry
halfpenny
three
miles
he
spoke
no
more
and
they
set
off
again
during
the
rest
of
the
day
mick
connor
maintained
his
attitude
of
detachment
striding
on
ahead
of
abner
as
though
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
they
bought
a
stale
loaf
in
a
small
market
town
and
the
irishman
produced
from
the
treacle
tin
that
he
carried
three
eggs
and
some
rashers
of
bacon
they
lit
a
fire
on
the
edge
of
a
wood
and
made
a
good
meal
toward
evening
they
crossed
a
wide
river
flowing
silently
between
high
banks
mick
who
appeared
to
know
the
country
told
abner
that
this
was
the
last
bridge
for
twenty
miles
beyond
the
stream
a
little
town
lay
smoking
under
the
they
drank
a
pint
of
beer
together
and
pushed
on
the
evening
light
seemed
to
awaken
mick
he
became
talkative
and
profane
at
once
disclosing
to
abner
the
fact
that
he
knew
where
good
work
was
to
be
had
he
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
abner
s
working
underground
while
there
was
a
chance
of
earning
his
living
in
the
open
air
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
a
job
will
make
your
teeth
water
he
said
at
first
he
kept
up
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
of
the
kind
that
particularly
pleased
him
but
when
abner
pressed
him
he
disclosed
the
fact
that
he
had
learned
from
a
tramp
near
bromsgrove
how
the
corporation
of
north
bromwich
were
engaged
in
relaying
a
defective
piece
of
piping
ten
miles
long
in
their
welsh
water
scheme
and
that
casual
labour
was
hard
to
get
in
those
parts
with
the
combination
of
his
own
wit
and
abner
s
strength
they
should
find
a
comfortable
job
to
last
them
for
six
months
he
reckoned
that
three
days
walking
would
bring
them
easily
to
the
site
of
the
work
and
gave
abner
to
understand
that
he
was
lucky
to
have
met
him
abner
was
ready
to
acknowledge
this
that
s
all
right
then
said
mick
and
now
about
that
tenpence
halfpenny
do
you
think
i
d
be
after
sleeping
wud
you
and
not
know
of
the
gold
sovereign
that
s
in
your
waistcoat
pocket
this
moment
it
s
on
the
table
the
cards
should
be
if
we
re
travelling
at
this
abner
was
really
angry
he
didn
t
like
the
idea
of
any
one
friend
or
no
rummaging
in
his
pockets
at
night
they
stopped
in
the
road
quarrelling
and
abner
took
off
his
coat
preparing
to
settle
the
matter
with
blows
before
parting
company
the
irishman
seemed
surprised
that
he
took
it
so
roughly
pointed
out
that
when
he
had
the
chance
of
stealing
abner
s
money
he
hadn
t
taken
it
said
that
he
didn
t
want
a
penny
of
it
little
by
little
with
soft
and
humorous
words
he
cooled
abner
s
anger
at
the
next
inn
they
split
the
sovereign
over
two
quarts
of
beer
and
by
the
time
he
had
finished
drinking
abner
was
ready
to
go
shares
with
the
change
an
offer
that
mick
was
too
generous
to
accept
what
for
would
i
want
money
he
said
as
long
as
i
d
have
the
price
of
a
naggin
in
my
pockut
a
man
must
be
a
fool
he
added
if
he
couldn
t
travel
in
a
fat
country
the
likes
of
england
without
money
in
ireland
it
was
true
one
had
to
use
one
s
wits
for
every
one
else
was
doing
the
same
thing
he
searched
in
his
pockets
and
laid
out
a
yellow
piece
of
paper
among
the
on
the
inn
table
an
irishman
s
passport
he
called
it
actually
it
was
an
eviction
order
which
seemed
to
abner
an
unusual
type
of
letter
of
credit
not
a
bit
of
it
said
mick
in
ireland
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
carry
this
along
with
you
and
tell
a
tale
about
the
little
children
was
starving
on
you
and
you
could
kick
a
shillun
out
of
every
priest
you
come
across
in
the
old
days
there
was
many
a
toff
that
d
give
you
half
a
crown
to
be
rid
of
you
they
had
another
drink
and
mick
became
rhapsodical
on
the
subject
of
money
what
good
had
money
ever
done
him
money
in
his
day
he
d
had
the
money
would
buy
the
two
sides
of
grafton
street
he
recalled
his
great
double
on
winkfield
s
pride
and
manifesto
for
the
lincoln
and
national
three
hundred
pounds
in
his
pocket
but
it
went
away
like
wather
porther
would
have
supplied
a
better
simile
when
once
he
began
to
talk
about
horses
there
was
no
stopping
him
the
lust
of
the
born
gambler
shone
in
his
small
blue
eyes
take
away
racing
and
i
m
gone
he
said
it
s
the
only
thing
that
keeps
the
life
in
me
he
went
on
talking
until
he
saw
that
abner
was
nearly
asleep
over
the
table
then
he
plucked
at
his
arm
come
along
he
said
let
s
be
getting
a
move
on
before
we
re
threw
that
night
in
a
condition
of
sublime
charity
toward
the
world
and
each
other
they
could
find
no
barn
to
sleep
in
and
rolled
themselves
up
on
a
bank
of
dry
bracken
under
the
misty
moon
counting
his
money
next
morning
abner
found
that
most
of
it
had
gone
he
knew
better
than
to
grumble
about
it
but
suggested
to
mick
that
they
had
better
go
easy
go
aisy
is
it
not
at
all
said
the
irishman
at
midday
leaving
abner
in
a
small
spinney
of
firs
he
went
off
to
the
nearest
village
with
the
price
of
a
quart
and
returned
a
couple
of
hours
later
laden
not
only
with
the
beer
but
with
a
fowl
and
pockets
full
of
potatoes
displaying
these
spoils
he
winked
and
abner
asked
no
questions
they
boiled
water
in
mick
s
treacle
tin
and
having
poured
this
over
the
bird
to
make
the
plucking
easy
roasted
it
with
the
potatoes
in
the
embers
of
their
fire
it
was
a
splendid
meal
beneath
its
charred
covering
the
flesh
was
sweet
and
juicy
abner
had
never
felt
fitter
in
his
life
or
freer
from
every
vestige
of
care
when
the
meal
was
over
mick
slept
like
a
gorged
and
woke
in
an
but
by
this
time
abner
was
getting
used
to
his
alternations
of
enthusiasm
and
melancholy
and
left
him
alone
it
was
a
good
life
there
was
no
denying
that
and
in
another
day
or
so
they
would
arrive
at
the
scene
of
their
new
work
that
misty
moon
was
no
negligible
portent
for
at
sunset
great
clouds
began
to
gather
from
the
south
and
before
night
fell
a
thunder
shower
that
drenched
them
the
dusty
road
drank
up
the
rain
and
all
the
earth
smelt
sweet
but
the
august
weather
had
broken
and
the
country
of
wooded
hills
into
which
they
had
now
come
seemed
to
breed
rain
they
decided
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
dry
their
clothes
and
pushed
on
through
the
night
mick
loping
ahead
like
some
drowned
bird
and
abner
stolidly
following
they
passed
through
the
wet
streets
of
a
country
town
at
midnight
not
a
light
could
be
seen
in
the
solemn
georgian
houses
but
from
a
belfry
almost
lost
in
cloud
the
sound
of
a
plaintive
carillon
floated
down
ludlow
said
mick
there
do
be
races
they
crossed
another
noisy
river
the
road
climbed
endlessly
winding
over
a
steep
they
entered
a
forest
where
the
rain
troubled
them
no
more
so
tired
that
they
decided
to
rest
for
a
while
here
they
had
the
luck
to
find
a
hut
thatched
with
heather
that
had
been
used
by
woodcutters
at
the
risk
of
burning
it
over
their
heads
they
lit
a
fire
with
some
dry
branches
that
they
found
inside
it
here
they
lay
with
stolidly
chewing
tobacco
for
abner
unused
to
the
road
had
allowed
his
store
to
become
soaked
mick
soon
fell
asleep
but
abner
could
not
do
so
he
lay
there
till
dawn
in
his
steaming
clothes
listening
to
the
incessant
dripping
of
the
rain
from
millions
of
leaves
a
sound
that
was
soothing
in
spite
of
its
desolation
sometimes
a
wind
that
could
not
be
felt
would
stir
the
tops
of
the
trees
to
a
commotion
and
then
the
drops
would
fall
like
hail
on
the
soaked
leaves
of
the
forest
the
fire
died
down
there
was
no
more
wood
in
the
hut
and
drops
of
water
began
to
fall
from
the
roof
into
the
hissing
embers
it
was
hellishly
cold
but
mick
still
slept
like
a
dog
though
his
left
leg
twitched
in
his
sleep
at
dawn
abner
woke
him
he
grumbled
because
abner
in
his
vigil
had
finished
the
tobacco
it
looked
once
more
as
if
they
were
going
to
fall
out
but
the
sense
of
common
misery
was
too
great
to
allow
them
to
do
so
they
tramped
on
through
the
woods
in
the
rain
they
could
see
nothing
ahead
of
them
but
misty
trees
and
no
sound
came
to
them
but
that
of
dripping
moisture
and
sometimes
the
harsh
call
of
a
jay
the
sun
was
so
completely
veiled
that
dawn
passed
into
day
almost
without
their
knowing
it
only
a
whiter
colder
light
gleamed
from
the
wet
leaves
we
ll
never
get
shut
on
these
bleedin
trees
said
abner
but
his
companion
did
not
answer
suddenly
mick
began
to
sing
in
a
hoarse
unnatural
voice
macarthy
took
the
floor
in
enniscorthy
macarthy
took
the
floor
in
enniscorthy
for
his
eyes
and
ears
and
nose
were
like
marbles
on
the
floor
of
the
fragments
of
the
man
they
called
macarthy
he
sang
the
same
verse
over
and
over
again
and
at
the
end
of
the
third
repetition
he
stood
stock
still
for
they
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
by
the
houly
we
re
through
wud
it
he
said
the
huge
confusion
of
the
radnor
march
lay
before
them
vast
and
sombre
and
wild
with
cloud
to
north
and
south
of
the
spot
where
they
were
standing
the
woods
rolled
backward
into
england
upward
to
the
sky
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
they
had
emerged
a
little
below
the
crest
of
the
hills
for
the
precipitous
wall
behind
them
rose
magnificently
black
into
the
mist
with
fleeces
of
cloud
entangled
in
its
surface
like
wisps
of
wool
in
a
winter
hedge
beneath
their
feet
a
lake
of
white
vapour
hid
the
trough
of
the
teme
valley
lapping
the
bases
of
other
wooded
hills
nothing
could
they
see
but
dark
masses
of
trees
thrown
into
fantastic
folds
and
pinnacles
by
the
shapes
of
the
hills
that
carried
them
an
amphitheatre
of
savage
stone
fleeced
with
unending
woods
that
s
wales
said
mick
god
i
could
do
with
a
drop
in
spite
of
the
melancholy
grandeur
of
the
scene
abner
felt
that
an
end
was
in
sight
they
scrambled
down
a
steep
bank
and
mick
still
singing
stampeded
a
flock
of
horned
sheep
that
crowded
with
glistening
wool
under
the
lee
of
a
hedge
they
crossed
a
zone
of
huge
hawthorns
and
came
to
a
road
or
rather
a
rutted
track
of
wheels
that
cut
the
diagonally
in
the
middle
of
this
track
stood
a
wooden
sled
with
iron
chains
for
carting
timber
and
a
pile
of
that
had
been
dumped
at
this
stage
of
their
descent
from
the
woods
plenty
of
work
here
said
mick
time
they
ve
finished
clearing
they
followed
the
track
to
a
gate
that
gave
on
to
a
metalled
road
even
this
was
heavily
scarred
with
the
cartage
of
timber
on
every
side
the
vast
debris
of
forestry
was
seen
birds
began
to
sing
in
the
wet
hedgerows
the
road
was
alive
with
and
linnets
the
rain
ceased
the
scramble
down
the
had
warmed
them
and
they
now
walked
at
a
good
pace
villages
were
few
the
greatest
of
them
no
more
than
hamlets
clustered
about
farms
and
as
yet
no
labourers
were
seen
in
the
fields
for
miles
and
miles
they
passed
no
ne
er
a
drop
stirrin
said
mick
this
is
a
grand
country
right
enough
by
eight
o
clock
the
sun
was
through
and
the
folding
mist
sucked
upwards
revealed
great
stretches
of
arable
land
that
would
have
been
melancholy
in
dull
weather
but
now
began
to
gleam
in
patches
of
warm
colour
moisture
clarified
all
the
air
ripening
for
harvest
were
full
of
tawny
lights
and
the
breasts
of
the
linnets
rosy
a
signpost
told
them
that
they
were
less
than
a
mile
from
aston
by
lesswardine
and
in
a
few
moments
they
saw
a
little
church
hedged
in
with
pagan
yews
and
a
dilapidated
parsonage
still
dead
asleep
mick
thanked
god
for
the
sight
of
an
inn
even
though
it
were
closed
a
swinging
sign
with
a
heraldic
device
battered
by
long
conflict
with
rain
and
wind
proclaimed
it
the
delahay
arms
tall
hollyhocks
stood
sentinel
on
either
side
of
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
village
they
took
a
to
lesswardine
moving
through
of
brilliant
emerald
with
placid
dykes
on
either
side
somewhere
near
them
ran
a
river
its
course
marked
by
a
black
line
of
brushwood
sunlight
becoming
more
generous
warmed
them
through
and
through
the
road
drew
near
to
the
river
and
to
a
spur
of
hills
nursing
the
valley
of
a
tributary
in
a
sheltered
coomb
they
saw
an
encampment
of
white
tents
bleaching
in
the
sun
a
wood
fire
was
lighted
among
them
the
smoke
went
straight
upward
round
the
fire
they
saw
men
lounging
in
their
among
great
stacks
of
there
was
a
tempting
smell
of
bacon
in
the
air
which
made
their
mouths
water
what
are
these
chaps
about
mick
abner
asked
cloggers
mick
shouted
back
to
him
the
tenth
chapter
abner
and
mick
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
bivouac
its
inhabitants
did
not
seem
to
be
disturbed
by
their
presence
mick
who
was
never
at
a
loss
for
words
gave
them
a
tall
man
with
a
large
unshaven
face
and
a
check
handkerchief
knotted
round
his
neck
who
was
sitting
on
a
log
by
the
fire
turned
and
stared
at
him
he
had
wide
humorous
eyes
and
when
he
spoke
he
gave
the
impression
by
winking
that
his
words
concealed
some
subtle
joke
meanwhile
with
each
of
his
hands
he
sat
fondling
an
immense
and
hairy
forearm
well
lad
what
is
it
he
asked
in
a
strong
lancashire
accent
mick
explained
that
abner
and
he
were
looking
for
work
on
the
welsh
water
and
asked
if
it
were
anywhere
near
by
eh
you
ve
a
good
step
yet
said
the
other
they
re
working
up
beyond

road

said
the
sardonically
work
for
them
that
likes
his
wink
seemed
to
imply
that
mick
obviously
didn

three
other
men
lounged
up
to
them
another
who
was
holding
a
shovel
over
the
fire
sang
out
come
on
joe
the
rasher
s
the
big
man
raised
himself
from
his
log
before
this
it
had
been
impossible
to
realise
his
hugeness
better
have
summat
t
eat
wi

he
said
his
sudden
hospitality
so
little
in
keeping
with
his
appearance
surprised
abner
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
settled
down
with
the
rest
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
frizzled
bacon
and
large
cans
of
tea
mick
was
soon
at
home
contriving
at
the
same
time
to
eat
enormously
and
to
keep
the
conversation
going
the
encampment
as
he
had
first
explained
to
abner
was
one
of
many
such
that
may
be
found
scattered
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
radnor
march
in
summertime
the
men
who
inhabit
them
are
known
as
cloggers
they
come
from
the
black
industrial
towns
of
lancashire
and
their
business
is
the
making
of
wooden
clogs
all
are
skilled
labourers
and
in
each
of
their
communities
there
is
a
foreman
on
whom
the
commercial
responsibilities
of
the
venture
falls
early
in
spring
he
makes
a
visit
to
the
border
country
and
bargains
with
farmers
and
landowners
for
the
right
to
cut
the
thickets
of
black
alder
that
choke
the
bottom
of
every
valley
in
this
western
brookland
in
may
the
rest
of
the
gang
follow
and
there
begins
a
nomadic
life
in
which
they
wander
from
valley
to
valley
felling
the
thickets
stripping
the
black
bark
from
wood
of
a
milky
whiteness
and
cutting
billets
of
a
size
suitable
for
on
rainy
days
when
their
harvest
is
well
in
hand
they
carry
the
process
further
and
set
to
making
the
clogs
themselves
sometimes
they
live
under
canvas
on
the
site
of
their
labours
sometimes
they
find
lodgings
in
the
nearest
village
always
as
rather
as
carry
with
them
a
reputation
for
boldness
and
extravagance
in
speech
and
behaviour
but
for
all
that
the
border
people
make
much
of
them
knowing
that
they
earn
plenty
of
money
and
spend
it
freely
the
valley
on
which
abner
and
his
friend
had
lighted
was
by
this
time
nearly
stripped
of
its
alders
piles
of
clean
white
billets
stood
bleaching
in
the
morning
sun
ready
to
be
carted
to
the
nearest
point
on
the
railway
you
re
not
afther
wanting
a
hand
with
the
wood

we

have
a
quart
together
then
come
on
lads
abner
and
mick
took
their
dismissal
and
moved
off
together
the
sun
was
now
high
and
not
a
shred
of
mist
remained
in
all
the
river
basin
before
this
it
had
seemed
confined
on
every
side
by
high
hills
thickly
wooded
now
to
westward
far
greater
hills
arose
huge
bare
and
dappled
with
shadows
of
the
last
retreating
clouds
while
they
breakfasted
abner
had
laid
out
his
tobacco
to
dry
in
the
sun
they
lighted
their
pipes
and
walked
on
cheerily
mick
singing
fragments
of
a
song
about
the
sultan
of
the
turks
and
the
irish
board
of
works
they
crossed
the
river
teme
by
a
stone
bridge
above
a
glassy
pool
i
m
telling
you
there
s
a
fine
lot
of
salmon
in
there
said
mick
salmon
asked
abner
who
had
only
been
acquainted
with
the
tinned
variety
of
this
fish
salmon
right
enough
said
mick
leaning
on
the
parapet
the
times
i
ve
watched
them
coming
up
the
river
barrow
before
you
was
the
height
of
a
match
they
left
the
roofs
of
lesswardine
on
their
right
turning
in
towards
the
bare
hills
the
river
swept
away
from
them
to
cut
the
village
in
two
from
a
perpendicular
tower
of
reddish
stone
they
heard
a
lazy
peal
of
bells
sunday
morning
said
mick
god
help
us
from
all
that
silent
countryside
from
the
towers
of
many
hidden
villages
other
bells
were
heard
melancholy
mellow
voices
floating
luxuriously
in
an
air
lightened
by
rain
by
the
houly
mick
continued
and
the
pubs
shut
on
me
if
it
isn
t
enough
to
make
a
man
make
dead
childer
they
passed
three
villages
in
which
closed
doors
confirmed
this
gloomy
reflection
the
villages
themselves
were
not
gloomy
leisure
prosperity
and
content
radiated
from
their
flowery
gardens
from
the
clean
pinafores
and
collars
of
the
children
loitering
to
church
from
the
faces
of
the
men
who
gossiped
at
the
gates
of
sunny
gardens
in
their
in
no
part
of
england
could
villages
more
trimly
english
have
been
found
than
in
this
ultimate
border
of
the
marches
it
was
as
though
the
nearness
of
another
and
an
alien
civilisation
compelled
them
to
insist
on
their
national
character
in
wales
said
mick
sourly
there
s
divil
a
one
open
sunda
they
crossed
another
river
the
noisy
barbel
a
torrent
of
mountain
water
wherein
no
weeds
could
grow
swirling
clear
into
black
pools
a
stone
set
in
the
middle
of
the
bridge
told
them
that
they
were
now
in
wales
and
as
though
to
emphasise
the
change
of
country
the
barren
rose
abruptly
to
receive
them
on
their
right
a
tremendous
crag
of
gray
stone
crowned
with
a
pointed
earthwork
and
in
front
of
them
fold
on
fold
of
softer
contours
pale
in
the
sunlight
from
the
intricate
convolutions
of
which
the
brawling
river
issued
a
village
of
stone
awaited
them
blank
fronting
on
the
roadway
with
small
windows
and
roofs
of
clumsy
slate
in
the
midst
an
ugly
chapel
with
the
word
ebenezer
carved
above
its
doorway
from
which
the
sound
of
a
drawling
hymn
emerged
and
at
the
end
of
the
village
a
with
the
painted
head
of
a
bison
for
sign
and
as
mick
had
anticipated
closed
doors
even
the
windows
were
shuttered
we
ll
see
if
there
s
annything
stirrin
said
mick
beating
at
the
door
for
a
time
they
could
get
no
answer
but
at
last
the
door
was
cautiously
opened
and
the
head
of
an
old
man
appeared
how
old
he
was
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
say
for
though
his
eyes
were
rheumy
and
the
irises
ringed
with
the
white
circles
of
age
his
hair
was
plentiful
and
scarcely
streaked
with
gray
he
leaned
on
a
stick
and
did
not
seem
pleased
to
see
them
speaking
in
a
tongue
that
abner
could
scarcely
understand
when
they
told
him
that
wigan
joe
had
sent
them
he
became
a
little
more
hospitable
but
the
consciousness
of
a
wesleyan
policeman
in
the
village
still
prevented
him
from
opening
the
door
to
them
the
foreman
of
the
job
he
said
whose
name
was
eve
could
certainly
be
found
at
the
pound
house
at
mainstone
three
miles
away
over
the
river
that
s
in
england
he
mumbled
as
though
he
were
speaking
of
a
barbarous
foreign
country
as
to
lodgings
he
could
not
help
them
on
tuesday
the
cloggers
were
coming
over
from
lesswardine
and
had
arranged
to
take
his
two
rooms
mick
pressed
him
and
he
admitted
that
at
a
pinch
his
wife
might
be
able
to
put
them
up
until
then
provided
that
they
were
in
a
position
to
pay
for
a
room
and
food
abner
assured
him
that
that
was
all
right
but
he
still
refused
to
commit
himself
till
mrs
malpas
returned
from
chapel
as
a
favour
he
allowed
them
at
last
to
leave
their
bundles
with
him
while
they
set
off
again
to
find
the
foreman
they
promised
to
return
to
chapel
green
in
the
evening
and
before
they
turned
their
backs
he
had
closed
the
door
again
with
evident
relief
they
reached
mainstone
just
before
the
opening
of
the
pound
house
the
foreman
eve
whom
his
associates
called
gunner
a
little
man
who
wore
a
shield
over
the
socket
from
which
one
of
his
eyes
was
missing
told
them
that
they
need
not
want
for
a
job
if
they
meant
business
and
told
them
to
apply
to
the
clerk
of
the
works
early
on
monday
morning
you
say
mr
eve
sent
you
and
it
ll
be
all
at
the
end
of
this
sentence
he
was
snatched
away
by
a
power
beyond
his
control
for
the
doors
of
the
opened
and
the
twenty
or
thirty
men
who
had
been
lounging
outside
flowed
into
the
bar
like
metal
into
a
mould
it
was
a
clean
and
pleasant
place
surrounded
by
settles
of
black
welsh
oak
the
presence
of
the
navvies
from
the
waterworks
had
made
it
into
a
kind
of
recognised
canteen
and
behind
the
bar
were
ranged
three
great
barrels
of
astill
s
ales
even
at
a
distance
of
eighty
miles
from
north
bromwich
the
power
of
astill
s
influence
was
felt
mick
without
any
difficulty
had
already
enrolled
himself
as
a
member
of
the
company
he
had
paired
off
with
a
big
lumbering
fellow
in
corduroys
with
a
red
stupid
face
and
curly
hair
who
s
going
to
give
the
ball
a
kick
abner
heard
him
saying
and
a
moment
later
he
was
taking
a
quart
pot
of
beer
from
a
dark
strapping
girl
who
served
behind
the
counter
a
medley
of
voices
arose
the
accents
of
the
welsh
the
soft
hereford
burr
a
smattering
of
audacious
cockney
and
then
the
harsher
northern
speech
of
a
number
of
cloggers
who
had
wandered
in
the
room
was
crowded
to
suffocation
and
abner
found
himself
lucky
to
get
a
seat
alongside
the
foreman
eve
on
a
bench
near
to
the
window
abner
began
to
talk
to
him
but
the
gunner
was
not
inclined
to
keep
it
up
he
was
a
little
man
with
jaws
from
which
speech
seemed
to
escape
with
difficulty
his
whole
body
was
spare
and
dessicated
and
his
skin
so
tanned
with
exposure
to
weather
that
the
patterns
tattooed
on
his
forearms
were
scarcely
distinguishable
from
his
skin
he
drank
rum
and
water
stolidly
with
a
little
cough
between
each
gulp
and
scrutinised
all
the
company
with
his
one
eye
that
was
dark
and
keen
like
that
of
a
bird
of
prey
he
drank
three
or
four
rums
one
after
the
other
but
the
process
had
no
loosening
effect
on
his
taciturnity
nor
did
it
dim
the
brightness
of
his
eye
abner
asked
him
how
long
he
had
been
on
the
waterworks
job
fourteen
year
he
said
is
it
like
to
last
long
it
s
like
to
last
as
long
as
i
do
i
m
what
you
might
call
on
the
establishment
as
they
say
in
the
service
been
with
it
since
they
made
the
resservoyer
in
the
dulas
valley
they
say
it
s
an
unlucky
job
this
here
water
i
was
there
when
the
dam
was
broke
nine
year
ago
always
something
up
with
it
then
warming
a
little
he
began
to
ask
abner
if
he
were
used
to
navvying
work
snorted
when
he
told
him
he
was
a
miner
and
told
him
that
he
d
have
a
job
to
get
a
bed
to
sleep
in
the
cloggers
is
coming
into
the
buffalo
tuesday
he
said
and
the
folk
round
here
is
scared
of
us
they
re
like
children
with
strangers
they
re
a
lot
of
damned
welshmen
only
don
t
you
tell
em
so
or
they
ll
let
you
know
about
he
waved
to
the
dark
girl
behind
the
counter
who
brought
him
another
tot
of
spirit
as
though
she
understood
his
signal
you
re
looking
up
fine
susie
he
said
get
away
with
you
mr
eve
she
replied
she
may
have
blushed
but
the
blood
ran
so
richly
under
her
brown
cheeks
that
no
blush
could
have
been
seen
eve
took
hold
of
her
arm
and
pulled
her
gently
towards
him
evidently
she
was
used
to
being
handled
for
she
did
not
seem
to
resent
it
with
her
dark
hair
almost
brushing
the
foreman
s
cheek
she
winked
at
abner
mr
badger
been
down
said
eve
in
a
whisper
oh
you
a
tease
she
said
with
a
movement
of
petulance
now
do
let
me
go
you
re
not
the
only
gentleman
that
wants
eve
gently
pinched
her
arm
well
then
he
said
just
you
ask
george
malpas
to
come
and
have
a
word
with
me
there
s
a
good
girl
she
left
them
pushing
her
way
familiarly
through
the
crowd
of
men
with
a
refined
excuse
me
and
crossed
the
room
towards
a
tall
dark
young
man
better
dressed
than
most
of
the
company
who
stood
holding
a
pot
of
ale
in
the
opposite
corner
and
talking
to
wigan
joe
who
had
just
arrived
when
the
girl
spoke
to
him
he
nodded
and
a
moment
later
came
over
to
the
bench
on
which
abner
and
the
foreman
were
sitting
from
the
very
first
abner
liked
his
face
and
indeed
he
was
a
handsome
specimen
of
the
border
type
with
an
olive
skin
and
dark
eyes
set
rather
wide
apart
under
level
brows
at
the
moment
his
cheeks
were
a
little
flushed
with
the
liquor
that
he
had
been
drinking
he
and
the
gunner
were
evidently
old
friends
well
george
said
eve
how
goes
it
middling
gunner
now
my
son
hark
to
me
this
young
chap
here
is
coming
on
to
our
job

mining
chap
from

bromwich
way
and
he
wants

find
a
lodge
think
you
can
do
something
for
him

george
malpas

to
oblige
you
i
ve
a
mate

of
me
said
abner
your
mate
looks
more
like
sleeping
in
a
ditch
said
the
gunner
with
a
dour
glance
at
mick
irishmen
are
all
alike
god
don
t
i
know
em
i
ve
been
shipmates
with
one
or
two
of

george
malpas

be
glad
of
a
decent
all
right
i
ll
take
him
along
with
me
when
they
close
don
t
you
he
moved
off
again
towards
the
bar
at
the
same
moment
there
appeared
in
the
doorway
a
man
of
middle
height
and
sturdy
build
he
was
dressed
in
a
cord
shooting
coat
and
breeches
his
face
was
swarthy
and
sanguine
and
he
surveyed
the
company
as
though
he
had
a
grudge
against
every
one
of
them
indeed
he
had
reason
to
be
suspicious
for
if
black
glances
could
have
killed
he
would
have
been
a
dead
man
within
a
minute
of
entering
the
room
he
stood
there
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
the
hostility
of
the
bar
to
take
some
more
tangible
form
and
at
last
a
young
man
emerging
from
a
pint
pot
with
an
accession
of
dutch
courage
said
mildly
well
mr
badger
how
be
the
young
pheasants
going
don
t
you
ask
him
said
another
this
be
a
terrible
place
for
the
keeper
took
no
notice
of
these
remarks
nor
yet
of
the
laughter
that
followed
he
went
straight
up
to
the
counter
where
susie
stood
polishing
glasses
and
shook
hands
with
her
formally
who
s
he
asked
mick
connor
already
considerably
nourished
a
keeper
you
leave
go
of
him
darlin
you
d
as
well
be
shaking
hands
with
the
divil
you
d
best
hold
your
tongue
said
another
he
m
our
susie
s
gard
be
good
to
her
then
said
mick
with
a
sigh
neither
badger
nor
the
girl
seemed
to
be
conscious
of
these
reflections
on
their
intimacy
badger
was
leaning
over
the
bar
with
his
face
close
to
hers
and
whispering
she
still
went
on
polishing
her
glasses
mechanically
nodding
with
pursed
lips
in
response
to
whatever
he
was
saying
and
glancing
from
time
to
time
in
a
mirror
advertising
astill
s
bottled
ales
that
hung
on
the
wall
at
her
right
hand
evidently
all
was
not
well
for
she
hurriedly
rearranged
a
curl
of
dark
hair
that
hung
in
front
of
her
right
ear
and
had
become
entangled
in
a
garnet
this
process
of
preening
attracted
abner
s
attention
to
her
sex
suddenly
he
found
himself
comparing
her
rather
maturer
charms
with
those
of
susan
wade
perhaps
her
name
had
something
to
do
with
it
both
were
of
the
dark
beauty
which
had
always
attracted
him
though
susan
the
first
had
been
a
pale
and
little
more
than
a
girl
while
the
barmaid
was
a
woman
of
his
own
age
generously
yet
perfectly
formed
full
of
strength
and
health
and
physical
splendour
she
bent
over
to
listen
more
carefully
to
the
keeper
s
whisper
that
was
almost
lost
in
the
hubbub
of
the
taproom
and
abner
saw
the
smooth
whiteness
of
her
neck
faintly
browned
like
an
egg
the
liquor
that
he
had
taken
inflamed
his
imagination
for
the
moment
she
seemed
definitely
desirable
mick
connor
having
kicked
as
many
drinks
out
of
his
neighbours
as
they
would
give
him
staggered
over
to
abner
s
side
in
this
state
he
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
bird
his
small
eyes
glistened
and
the
arteries
of
his
temples
stood
out
like
whipcord
he
asked
abner
for
money
and
when
abner
said
quite
truthfully
that
he
had
none
to
spare
he
began
to
round
on
him
fiercely
in
a
language
that
nobody
could
understand
it
seemed
as
if
a
row
were
in
the
making
and
this
was
the
last
thing
that
abner
wished
for
he
didn
t
want
to
be
involved
with
mick
in
a
dispute
before
the
foreman
eve
who
stared
critically
at
his
friend
and
particularly
before
the
girl
who
stood
behind
the
counter
he
tried
to
lead
mick
away
before
it
was
too
late
but
the
irishman
wrenched
himself
free
from
his
hands
and
began
to
take
off
his
coat
for
a
fight
the
whole
room
was
now
listening
and
laughing
at
the
scene
the
girl
behind
the
bar
seeing
that
things
were
getting
serious
excused
herself
to
the
keeper
and
came
down
to
ask
abner
to
take
his
friend
away
we
can
t
have
this
sort
of
thing
in
here
you
know
she
said
she
came
so
near
to
abner
that
he
was
aware
of
the
smell
of
her
hair
her
nearness
disturbed
him
so
that
he
could
scarcely
answer
her
mick
however
found
no
difficulty
in
stating
his
case
at
the
top
of
his
voice
i
know
she
said
with
the
air
of
one
who
was
used
to
the
settling
of
such
complications
you
two
boys
had
better
go
out
and
get
a
bit
of
fresh
air
go
on
now
be
good
chaps
she
continued
or
i
shall
have
to
call
mick
turned
on
her
savagely
call
your
father
is
it
who
said
i
was
drunk
i
never
said
you
was
drunk
just
you
sit
down
and
be
by
this
time
badger
had
reached
her
side
best
leave
him
alone
susie
he
said
six
then
she
nodded
and
the
keeper
went
out
at
the
same
moment
the
landlord
of
the
house
a
short
wheezy
man
with
yellow
pockets
under
his
eyes
that
made
him
look
like
an
owl
appeared
behind
the
bar
and
shouted
to
susie
in
a
voice
asking
what
was
the
matter
it
s
all
right
dad
she
said
smiling
back
at
abner
who
had
by
this
time
succeeded
in
pushing
mick
connor
down
into
the
seat
next
to
the
foreman
and
thrusting
his
own
unfinished
pot
of
beer
into
his
hand
then
what
s
all
the
bloody
noise
about
mr
hind
inquired
with
a
violent
wheeze
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
don
t
forget
we
ve
got
a
new
policeman
here
that
s
a
stranger
to
the
ways
of
the
place
and
the
justices
lying
in
wait
for
me
i
can
t
have
no
rows
here
or
they
ll
be
saying
the
place
isn
t
properly
conducted
you
mind
that
boys
but
there
was
no
further
disturbance
mick
having
finished
the
rest
of
abner
s
beer
retired
mechanically
to
the
society
of
his
first
friend
the
big
navvy
in
corduroys
who
was
now
too
drunk
to
realise
what
money
he
was
spending
the
landlord
walked
to
and
fro
behind
the
narrow
bar
glancing
anxiously
at
the
minute
hand
of
the
clock
that
was
gradually
approaching
the
hour
of
two
and
talked
wheezily
about
his
distrust
of
the
new
policeman
through
the
little
door
of
the
kitchen
behind
the
bar
came
the
frizzle
of
a
basted
joint
followed
by
the
metallic
clang
of
an
oven
door
something
savoury
was
doing
for
dinner
the
clock
gave
a
whirring
noise
which
suggested
that
it
was
as
asthmatic
as
its
owner
and
struck
two
with
a
harsh
ringing
note
the
landlord
stopped
dead
in
his
prowling
time
he
shouted
see
you
monday
said
the
gunner
winking
at
abner
who
was
already
preparing
to
rescue
mick
connor
from
his
new
friend
the
bar
emptied
in
the
space
of
two
hours
its
atmosphere
had
become
so
thick
with
tobacco
smoke
and
the
fumes
of
liquor
that
it
smelt
stale
and
fetid
mick
was
walking
arm
in
arm
with
the
navvy
in
a
state
of
unstable
equilibrium
abner
took
his
arm
come
on
he
said
let
s
see
about
the
and
who
the
hell
are
you
said
the
irishman
truculently
you
keep
a
civil
distance
the
big
man
rallied
to
his
supporter
and
abner
saw
that
for
the
present
mick
was
best
left
alone
the
other
two
went
off
together
mick
singing
a
song
in
which
the
navvy
joined
though
he
did
not
know
the
tune
a
tall
policeman
with
whiskers
watched
them
from
the
other
side
of
the
road
abner
turned
and
saw
that
the
young
man
whom
the
gunner
had
addressed
as
george
malpas
was
waiting
for
him
best
come
along
of
me
to
the
buffalo
and
have
a
bite
he
said
and
they
set
off
together
abner
found
that
from
the
first
he
liked
george
malpas
his
dark
face
and
eyes
were
bright
with
the
drink
that
he
had
taken
his
speech
rapid
and
vivacious
they
walked
quickly
towards
chapel
green
and
the
hills
talking
all
the
way
and
abner
felt
that
this
was
the
first
person
whom
he
had
met
on
his
travels
who
really
accepted
him
with
naturalness
and
without
suspicion
malpas
told
him
that
he
need
not
worry
about
his
lodging
dad
s
getting
up
in
years
he
said
and
a
shadow
d
frighten
him
but
mother
s
all
there
and
she
don
t
know
how
to
say
no
to
he
spoke
all
the
time
quickly
and
with
a
certain
restlessness
that
on
the
surface
made
him
seem
free
and
daring
he
questioned
abner
eagerly
about
life
in
the
once
he
had
been
in
north
bromwich
and
this
experience
had
made
him
discontented
with
a
country
life
it
s
proper
dead
here
that
s
what
it
is
he
said
time
a
man
gets
to
my
age
he
ought
to
see
a
bit
of
the
world
but
a
chap
gets
nabbed
with
a
wife
and
a
couple
of
kids
and
then
it
s
kiss
me
to
all
that
you
single
chaps
don
t
know
your
luck
evidently
george
malpas
had
tried
his
hand
at
everything
he
had
been
a
wheelwright
a
farm
bailiff
for
a
year
or
two
he
had
helped
his
mother
in
the
management
of
the
buffalo
and
lately
since
the
job
on
the
had
begun
he
had
been
doing
labourer
s
work
a
thing
that
seemed
unnatural
to
a
man
so
handsomely
and
delicately
made
anything
for
a
change
that
s
what
i
say
he
maintained
what
a
chap
like
me
ought
to
do
is
go
to
sea
but
these
old
hills
are
like
a
prison
damn
me
if
i
wouldn
t
as
soon
be
in
shrewsbury
jail
as
here
they
crossed
the
bridge
into
wales
by
this
time
george
malpas
s
mother
had
returned
from
chapel
and
the
door
of
the
buffalo
was
unlocked
george
opened
it
for
abner
in
the
bar
on
the
left
he
saw
the
two
bundles
exposed
prominently
on
the
table
beyond
in
the
kitchen
they
found
the
old
man
sitting
in
the
and
mrs
malpas
dredging
flour
into
the
from
which
a
joint
of
beef
had
been
taken
just
in
time
mother
said
george
how
s
the
old
legs
dad
badly
badly
george
mumbled
his
father
can
you
give
us
a
bite
of
dinner
mother
at
first
mrs
malpas
did
not
reply
she
was
a
little
woman
primly
dressed
in
a
constricted
black
dress
she
had
a
mass
of
gray
hair
with
a
tinge
of
yellow
in
it
her
features
were
finely
shaped
like
those
of
her
son
but
her
mouth
was
hard
as
stone
when
she
had
finished
making
her
gravy
she
turned
a
pair
of
piercing
black
eyes
on
abner
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
it
was
level
and
expressionless
but
one
felt
all
the
time
that
she
meant
exactly
what
she
said
and
that
nothing
could
turn
her
from
a
determination
once
expressed
facing
her
he
found
that
her
face
was
beautiful
but
hardened
by
suffering
by
the
responsibility
of
an
old
and
ailing
husband
and
the
anxiety
of
a
wayward
son
is
this
the
young
man
who
left
his
bundle
here
with
dad
she
asked
yes
this
is
the
chap
all
he
wants
is
a
well
i
can
t
do
it
george
and
you
know
i
can
t
she
cried
what
with
the
cloggers
coming
and
all
your
father
told
them
the
old
man
nodded
give
us
some
dinner
first
mother
said
george
persuasively
then
we
ll
talk
about
it
s
no
good
talking
mrs
malpas
persisted
i
mean
what
i
said
and
so
does
your
although
it
was
obvious
that
nothing
that
the
old
man
might
say
would
alter
the
course
of
events
that
she
had
ordained
his
wife
had
acquired
the
habit
of
pretending
that
he
shared
the
responsibility
of
her
decisions
george
with
a
side
glance
of
encouragement
at
abner
tried
to
joke
her
out
of
her
seriousness
you
can
t
get
over
me
that
way
george
she
said
but
when
he
took
her
arm
her
eyes
and
mouth
softened
and
she
made
no
attempt
to
prevent
abner
sharing
the
meal
which
her
son
helped
her
to
put
on
the
table
at
the
end
of
the
process
he
kissed
her
and
she
suddenly
stiffened
you
ve
been
to
the
pound
house
george
i
can
smell
your
well
can
t
a
chap
go
to
the
pound
house
without
a
fuss
being
made
he
laughed
you
m
jealous
mother
of
that
seven
days
licence
if
it
was
to
make
my
fortune
this
minute
she
said
intensely
i
wouldn
t
sell
one
spot
of
drink
on
a
sunday
nor
would
father
she
added
in
a
milder
tone
the
flash
subsided
and
she
went
on
to
ask
about
mr
hind
s
asthma
but
she
took
no
notice
of
george
s
reply
for
her
inquiry
had
only
been
a
preliminary
to
asking
how
susie
was
she
watched
him
closely
when
he
replied
that
susie
was
all
right
her
new
friend
badger
was
there
he
added
with
a
laugh
i
mind
the
time
said
the
old
man
dreamily
when
there
was
three
badgers
dug
out
one
month
up
the
castel
ditches
turrible
teeth
a
badger
has
turrible
he
means
mr
badger
the
keeper
father
said
mrs
malpas
all
keepers
is
the
same
said
the
old
man
water
or
there
s
not
a
pin
between
he
relapsed
into
one
of
those
fits
of
vacuity
which
often
droused
his
normal
if
senile
intelligence
mrs
malpas
dragged
him
back
with
the
announcement
that
the
dinner
was
ready
i
ll
go
and
draw
some
beer
said
george
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
george
replied
mrs
malpas
you
ve
had
all
that
s
good
for
you
at
the
pound
house
if
your
father
can
do
without
beer
before
evening
so
can
you
george
passed
the
reproof
off
with
a
smile
but
stayed
where
he
was
meanwhile
mrs
malpas
rescued
four
hot
plates
from
the
oven
and
thrust
them
into
abner
s
hands
with
catch
on
please
and
the
party
settled
down
at
the
table
the
old
man
occupying
a
shiny
chair
with
a
patchwork
cushion
the
mother
rigid
as
her
own
facing
him
abner
and
george
disposed
on
either
side
of
them
the
food
was
excellent
and
abner
was
more
than
ready
for
it
it
was
the
first
square
meal
that
he
had
got
his
teeth
into
for
a
week
mrs
malpas
s
appetite
was
in
keeping
with
the
ascetic
character
of
her
face
but
the
old
man
ate
ravenously
of
beef
vegetables
and
dumplings
and
the
two
others
were
not
far
behind
him
all
through
the
meal
mrs
malpas
cast
anxious
glances
at
her
son
s
plate
abner
could
see
that
beneath
her
mask
of
severity
she
was
really
full
of
a
fierce
maternal
concern
for
his
comfort
the
only
tokens
of
tenderness
that
ever
appeared
in
her
were
shown
towards
him
when
she
spoke
of
george
s
wife
and
of
the
children
there
was
an
almost
imperceptible
hardening
in
her
tone
and
george
answered
her
shortly
as
if
he
knew
that
the
subject
had
only
been
raised
for
politeness
sake
for
all
this
they
enjoyed
their
meal
the
room
was
dim
for
the
hot
sun
from
outside
was
caught
in
the
folds
of
a
lace
curtain
and
a
mass
of
lush
geranium
plants
with
which
the
was
crowded
the
scent
of
their
leaves
filled
the
room
with
an
atmosphere
of
summer
languid
and
happy
one
could
almost
have
guessed
that
it
was
sunday
when
the
meal
was
over
abner
began
to
fill
his
pipe
no
smoking
in
here
young
man
said
mrs
malpas
sternly
if
you
want
to
smoke
you
d
best
go
into
the
it
s
mother
s
fancy
on
a
sunday
george
apologised
you
know
your
father
can
t
abear
it
said
mrs
malpas
but
the
old
man
who
usually
woke
up
when
his
name
was
mentioned
did
not
hear
her
being
busy
with
a
paper
packet
of
snuff
when
she
began
to
clear
the
table
george
returned
gallantly
to
the
subject
of
their
visit
what
about
this
chap
s
lodging
he
asked
it
s
no
good
asking
me
george
i
ve
told
you
you
can
give
him
a
bed
till
tuesday
while
he
s
looking
round
she
shook
her
head
positively
i
ve
got
to
clean
things
up
between
now
and
tuesday
besides
there
s
two
of
don
t
you
trouble
yourself
about
the
other
said
george
he
s
gone
off
with
one
of
our
gang
this
is
a
nice
steady
chap
but
mrs
malpas
did
not
budge
your
father
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
she
said
finally
by
this
time
she
had
cleared
away
the
dinner
things
taken
off
her
apron
and
placed
a
family
bible
with
a
blue
silk
marker
on
the
table
mr
malpas
had
settled
back
in
his
chair
by
the
hearth
with
a
snuffy
handkerchief
over
his
head
just
for
two
days
said
george
george
tis
no
he
knew
better
than
to
press
her
under
the
circumstances
and
so
they
prepared
to
go
abner
took
out
his
money
to
pay
for
the
meal
cupidity
struggled
with
principle
in
mrs
malpas
s
eyes
not
on
a
sunday
young
man
she
said
abner
thanked
her
clumsily
george
kissed
her
and
for
a
moment
she
dropped
her
stiffness
and
clung
to
him
come
on
then
he
said
to
abner
but
mr
malpas
was
already
asleep
his
mouth
sagging
beneath
the
edge
of
his
handkerchief
abner
picked
up
his
bundle
in
the
taproom
and
he
and
george
went
out
into
the
grilling
sunshine
the
eleventh
chapter
george
malpas
having
taken
a
fancy
to
abner
at
first
sight
had
determined
to
ask
his
own
wife
to
give
him
a
lodging
the
relation
between
the
two
young
men
had
begun
with
a
quick
spontaneous
liking
on
either
side
abner
was
only
too
glad
to
see
a
friendly
face
not
being
built
as
was
mick
connor
for
picaresque
adventure
and
feeling
that
it
would
be
well
to
settle
down
again
george
malpas
on
the
other
hand
liked
him
because
he
represented
something
new
because
he
had
exhausted
the
possibilities
of
the
cloggers
company
which
led
no
farther
than
the
pound
place
which
he
could
only
visit
with
irritation
since
badger
the
keeper
had
cut
him
out
with
susie
because
the
idea
of
a
presentable
stranger
living
in
his
own
house
appealed
to
him
on
the
score
of
variety
as
well
as
from
the
financial
point
of
view
as
they
left
the
buffalo
george
expounded
his
project
to
abner
it
did
him
good
he
said
to
talk
and
particularly
to
talk
to
a
man
of
his
own
age
who
could
understand
him
if
abner
had
been
married
he
would
have
realised
that
it
was
useless
talking
to
women
who
pretended
to
listen
but
never
gave
a
thought
to
what
a
man
was
saying
the
thought
of
his
marriage
always
roused
him
to
bitterness
it
had
been
imposed
on
him
indeed
by
the
anxiousness
of
his
mother
who
adored
him
her
only
son
beyond
words
and
under
the
influence
of
chapel
had
conceived
it
her
particular
duty
to
save
his
soul
from
hell
hell
in
the
eyes
of
mrs
malpas
meant
neither
more
nor
less
than
sexual
promiscuity
and
seeing
in
the
handsomeness
of
george
a
spiritual
danger
she
had
followed
the
advice
of
st
paul
and
married
him
safely
as
she
thought
before
worse
happened
she
herself
had
chosen
a
wife
for
him
indirectly
for
she
knew
that
he
was
wilful
and
easily
scared
she
had
contrived
to
make
him
fall
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
a
local
morgan
condover
a
steady
and
as
it
seemed
a
solid
man
who
managed
the
outlying
members
of
the
powys
estate
mary
condover
the
daughter
was
a
little
older
than
george
a
shy
beauty
with
whom
the
lad
soon
fell
in
love
george
as
the
only
son
of
the
innkeeper
at
chapel
green
was
considered
a
good
match
and
mrs
malpas
played
her
cards
so
well
that
within
six
months
of
falling
in
love
george
found
himself
married
and
installed
in
a
house
of
his
own
he
was
happy
mrs
malpas
could
see
that
for
herself
and
she
thanked
heaven
that
she
had
been
permitted
to
save
her
son
alive
before
a
year
was
over
george
s
first
child
was
born
there
was
a
great
christening
party
at
wolfpits
at
which
old
mr
condover
having
drunk
a
good
deal
more
than
mrs
malpas
approved
confided
to
her
that
his
whom
they
had
christened
gladys
would
take
the
first
place
in
his
will
this
was
exactly
what
mrs
malpas
had
intended
from
the
first
and
her
satisfaction
was
so
deep
that
she
could
almost
have
forgiven
the
bailiff
his
lapse
from
sobriety
in
spite
of
the
unfortunate
example
that
he
had
given
to
his
the
intense
thankfulness
that
flooded
her
heart
when
she
saw
george
so
happily
and
satisfactorily
bound
in
the
chains
of
domesticity
atoned
for
the
troubles
that
were
crowding
on
her
own
life
her
husband
who
had
been
ailing
for
some
years
was
smitten
with
a
stroke
of
paralysis
from
which
he
never
fully
recovered
she
knew
that
hard
times
were
coming
but
faced
them
cheerfully
for
many
years
mr
malpas
had
meant
less
to
her
as
a
husband
than
as
the
father
of
her
son
she
would
do
her
duty
by
could
suggest
that
she
had
ever
done
the
surface
she
would
acknowledge
him
still
as
the
head
of
her
household
but
his
illness
would
give
her
the
opportunity
of
managing
the
business
to
her
own
liking
and
scraping
together
in
the
years
that
remained
to
them
a
little
money
that
added
to
the
small
fortune
of
which
mr
condover
had
boasted
to
her
at
the
christening
should
make
her
son
secure
for
life
she
even
hoped
that
he
might
succeed
mr
condover
in
the
care
of
the
powys
estate
her
was
premature
just
before
the
birth
of
george
s
second
child
a
healthy
boy
whom
they
had
decided
to
name
morgan
after
his
grandfather
mr
condover
at
the
very
height
of
his
prosperity
hanged
himself
in
an
outhouse
his
death
revealed
the
fact
that
the
money
of
which
he
had
boasted
at
the
first
christening
did
not
exist
it
soon
appeared
that
he
had
defrauded
the
powys
estate
of
more
than
eight
hundred
pounds
and
rumour
said
that
he
had
been
involved
with
some
woman
in
ludlow
this
was
a
terrible
blow
to
mrs
malpas
for
in
remote
country
places
the
shames
of
the
fathers
are
visited
on
the
children
to
the
third
generation
and
never
forgotten
when
the
baby
was
born
she
begged
her
not
to
give
the
child
his
grandfather
s
name
but
mary
who
had
loved
her
father
obstinately
persisted
and
mrs
malpas
could
never
hear
it
without
feeling
that
it
carried
with
it
a
reproach
she
tried
to
persuade
george
to
change
it
but
george
did
not
care
he
was
no
longer
in
love
with
his
wife
who
now
stood
to
him
for
a
symbol
of
the
chains
that
his
mother
had
imposed
on
him
he
felt
that
she
had
cheated
him
out
of
an
enjoyment
of
life
that
was
his
due
at
any
cost
he
meant
to
regain
his
freedom
and
mary
and
his
mother
were
the
sufferers
the
wife
indeed
had
the
care
of
her
children
to
console
her
for
george
s
neglect
but
the
mother
against
whom
he
nursed
a
deep
indefinite
grudge
as
the
author
of
all
his
misfortunes
found
that
she
must
bear
the
responsibility
of
her
own
schemes
the
household
at
wolfpits
now
missed
the
subsidies
which
mr
condover
had
generously
distributed
from
his
masters
money
george
had
drifted
into
an
extravagant
way
of
life
that
he
had
no
intention
of
changing
partly
because
of
his
expansive
nature
and
partly
because
in
truth
he
had
never
had
his
fling
george
found
it
difficult
to
settle
to
any
steady
work
he
became
a
drain
upon
the
resources
of
the
buffalo
and
mrs
malpas
who
found
it
hard
to
refuse
him
anything
was
forced
to
draw
upon
her
savings
to
support
him
in
her
irritation
and
despair
she
blamed
mary
for
all
this
thinking
of
her
as
a
feckless
housewife
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
lavish
ways
of
her
father
the
bad
blood
s
in
her
and
is
bound
to
come
out
she
said
airing
her
grievances
on
mr
malpas
who
now
cared
for
nothing
but
his
food
george
did
not
mind
who
was
to
blame
as
long
as
he
got
the
money
that
he
wanted
he
was
beginning
to
be
interested
in
other
women
particularly
for
a
little
while
in
susie
hind
the
daughter
of
the
proprietor
of
the
pound
house
an
inn
which
mrs
malpas
had
always
regarded
as
the
buffalo
s
bitterest
rival
it
pained
her
beyond
words
to
think
that
her
savings
should
find
their
way
into
mr
hind
s
till
george
she
said
if
only
you
ll
keep
away
from
that
there
place
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
for
you
or
if
only
you
d
settle
to
regular
work
thank
you
kindly
said
george
why
don
t
you
let
me
take
on
the
licence
of
the
buffalo
now
that
dad
can
t
do
it
justice
then
you
and
dad
could
go
and
live
somewhere
quiet
as
you
ve
a
right
to
do
at
your
never
george
she
said
intensely
never
he
laughed
at
her
why
not
i
couldn
t
trust
you
she
said
the
man
that
keeps
a
public
ought
to
be
teetotal
i
know
what
would
happen
to
you
ve
never
give
me
a
chance
he
protested
what
s
more
i
m
not
going
to
she
maintained
it
s
a
job
i
m
cut
out
for
i
like
company
i
could
double
your
business
in
a
and
drink
yourself
dead
in
six
she
said
you
ve
never
seen
me
drunk
but
i
know
you
my
son
i
m
dead
sick
of
this
country
he
said
town
s
the
place
for
me
if
i
could
get
away
out
of
this
and
make
a
fresh
start
damn
me
if
i
won
t
do
hush
george
she
said
i
ve
never
heard
your
father
use
a
word
like
that
in
his
but
the
thing
that
she
was
really
frightened
of
was
that
he
should
go
he
was
the
only
thing
left
to
her
and
if
he
went
all
light
would
have
gone
from
her
life
she
controlled
her
tears
and
took
him
into
the
little
bedroom
where
in
an
oak
chest
she
kept
her
savings
she
gave
him
money
and
he
left
her
contented
kissing
her
with
an
affection
that
was
mingled
faintly
with
pity
when
she
held
him
in
her
arms
all
her
tense
anxiety
for
a
moment
disappeared
she
could
only
think
of
him
as
the
son
of
her
body
in
whose
happiness
and
physical
welfare
she
delighted
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
now
only
purchase
these
precious
moments
with
money
but
for
a
little
while
she
could
forget
this
in
the
joy
that
he
gave
her
time
after
time
he
begged
her
to
let
him
take
on
the
business
but
she
always
refused
him
sheltering
herself
as
her
habit
now
was
behind
the
negligible
personality
of
her
husband
it
would
have
shocked
her
beyond
words
if
george
had
pointed
out
to
her
that
his
father
didn
t
count
and
that
her
consideration
for
him
was
a
pretence
but
george
knew
better
than
to
vex
her
in
this
way
for
the
key
of
the
chest
upstairs
was
kept
in
her
pocket
what
is
more
even
though
their
two
wills
were
always
in
conflict
he
loved
his
mother
she
meant
a
great
deal
more
to
him
than
mary
had
ever
done
except
in
the
first
blindness
of
his
passion
and
for
this
reason
no
less
than
for
the
other
he
was
tolerant
don
t
you
take
no
notice
of
mother
he
told
abner
as
they
walked
along
together
she
s
got
a
funny
way
with
her
but
she
s
all
right
at
the
bottom
there
s
not
many
women
could
have
done
what
she
has
the
only
bad
turn
she
ever
done
me
was
when
she
got
me
threw
over
the
it
was
the
third
time
in
their
walk
that
george
had
spoken
grudgingly
of
his
wife
but
this
did
not
strike
abner
as
strange
for
it
was
exactly
the
attitude
not
only
of
his
father
but
of
most
of
the
men
with
whom
he
had
worked
at
mawne
he
grunted
sympathetically
in
answer
to
george
s
complaints
and
all
the
time
as
malpas
eagerly
expounded
his
own
aspirations
towards
freedom
and
adventure
they
were
climbing
gradually
passing
by
many
gyrations
of
a
narrow
road
into
the
curve
of
the
hills
in
which
wolfpits
lay
within
a
mile
of
chapel
green
the
character
of
the
country
changed
before
that
only
a
hint
of
mountainous
severity
had
been
visible
in
the
stone
buildings
of
the
village
with
their
narrow
windows
and
their
cruel
roofs
of
slate
at
chapel
green
the
pastures
that
lay
beside
the
river
were
not
greatly
different
from
the
of
teme
which
is
an
english
river
but
the
fields
through
which
the
road
to
wolfpits
passed
were
poor
and
of
a
paler
green
their
hedges
were
scanty
writhen
and
knotted
with
hard
life
the
generous
elms
grew
fewer
standing
stunted
forsaken
and
sparing
of
leaf
they
seemed
to
shiver
with
poverty
in
this
alien
soil
in
their
place
the
hardier
mountain
trees
appeared
birches
that
quivered
even
in
this
tranquil
air
oak
and
holly
and
yew
crouching
in
the
hedgerow
sombrely
but
crowned
with
waxen
honeysuckle
these
poor
fields
seemed
to
feel
the
pressure
of
the
hills
on
either
side
from
the
slopes
of
which
blown
spores
of
bracken
and
seeds
of
gorse
had
settled
and
thriven
like
in
a
rich
plain
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
smooth
boulders
were
scattered
and
through
the
pit
of
the
valley
a
noisy
tributary
of
the
barbel
that
abner
came
to
know
as
the
folly
brook
set
up
an
unceasing
murmur
like
that
of
a
on
summer
leaves
behind
a
dense
curtain
of
green
still
the
road
climbed
it
rose
in
bold
curves
like
a
kestrel
soaring
into
colder
air
sometimes
the
brook
flowed
near
it
and
abner
could
see
through
gaps
in
the
arras
of
alders
roaring
stickles
of
bright
water
sometimes
it
swept
away
from
them
hugging
the
foot
of
the
hills
sounding
no
more
than
the
evening
breeze
in
a
poplar
tree
gullies
that
fed
it
scored
the
road
with
tracks
of
winter
torrents
at
that
season
of
the
year
no
moving
water
could
be
seen
but
once
or
twice
in
shadier
places
slow
moisture
oozed
and
dripped
from
beds
of
mosses
on
the
banks
the
cloggers
is
coming
up
the
folly
when
they
ve
finished
down
lesswardine
way
said
george
i
reckon
they
ll
liven
things
up
a
the
road
grew
rougher
it
seemed
to
falter
in
its
purpose
where
do
you
get
to
this
way
abner
asked
right
up
into
the
forest
and
on
to
clun
but
not
many
uses
it
said
george
the
clun
men
don
t
come
much
over
our
way
tis
a
stiffish
bit
of
this
here
s
the
road
swept
up
obliquely
to
a
crest
and
then
sank
to
the
level
of
the
stream
abner
had
a
vision
of
the
whole
valley
expanding
into
a
kind
of
amphitheatre
through
the
middle
of
which
the
little
river
pursued
a
more
leisurely
course
winding
gently
through
the
fields
as
though
it
rejoiced
to
linger
under
the
open
sky
on
either
side
the
mountains
rose
to
their
full
height
no
longer
concealed
by
foothills
from
lip
to
lip
the
cup
was
roofed
with
dazzling
blue
in
the
open
space
beneath
an
avenue
of
chestnuts
led
upwards
from
the
river
to
a
great
red
house
fronted
with
three
pointed
gables
and
crowned
by
clusters
of
fantastic
you
don
t
mean
that
one
said
abner
ay
that
s
wolfpits
george
replied
looks
all
right
don
t
it
as
they
descended
the
house
was
lost
from
sight
and
george
began
to
explain
that
wolfpits
had
once
been
a
great
house
the
most
westerly
possession
of
the
family
whom
condover
his
had
served
but
that
the
pastures
which
surrounded
it
for
all
their
greenness
were
poor
and
the
mansion
itself
too
remote
and
gloomy
for
gentlefolks
to
inhabit
in
this
age
of
comfort
they
say
it
s
ha
nted
too
he
declared
with
a
laugh
though
i
don
t
pay
no
heed
to
such
stories
i
reckon
it
stood
here
empty
for
close
on
a
hundred
years
till
mary
s
father
got
mr
mckellar
the
agent
to
let
it
off
in
pieces
to
them
that
wanted
houses
there
s
more
than
five
farms
up
this
valley
lying
empty
for
the
want
of
a
bit
of
work
putting
into
them
but
the
old
lord
was
so
took
up
with
his
new
model
village
down
by
lesswardine
he
hadn
t
the
money
to
put
into
the
old
ones
not
that
i
grumble
at
him
tis
a
good
solid
house
to
live
in
there
s
three
families
in
it
now
and
room
for
four
more
in
my
opinion
and
i
reckon
i
ve
a
kind
of
right
to
it
he
went
on
the
malpases
was
big
people
in
these
parts
at
one
time
you
ll
find
their
names
on
the
vault
in
lesswardine
church
that
s
how
it
s
written
there
s
a
reverent
cyril
malpas
rector
of
aston
to
this
day
mary
s
father
went
into
the
family
history
at
the
time
we
was
married
the
condovers
is
an
old
family
these
claims
to
a
faded
aristocracy
did
not
interest
abner
but
he
could
not
help
being
impressed
by
the
size
of
the
house
as
they
approached
it
through
the
shade
of
the
chestnut
avenue
it
was
built
of
small
red
bricks
strange
to
the
country
but
now
beautifully
weathered
by
time
the
eastern
end
was
covered
with
a
gigantic
growth
of
ivy
but
from
the
western
side
which
they
were
approaching
the
parasite
had
been
stripped
on
mr
condover
s
advice
and
the
red
wall
glowed
as
though
it
were
exuding
the
imprisoned
sunshine
of
three
centuries
in
this
generous
light
one
did
not
notice
an
air
of
desolation
which
the
uncurtained
upper
windows
gave
to
it
all
that
s
wrong
with
this
old
place
said
george
is
the
rats
but
i
reckon
you
ve
been
sleeping
rough
and
won
t
notice
them
this
is
our
garden
mary
s
a
great
one
for
they
had
entered
a
drive
that
swept
up
in
a
spacious
curve
to
the
steps
of
the
an
entrance
which
had
been
closed
for
many
years
in
place
of
the
lawns
that
had
once
been
the
pride
of
its
inhabitants
lay
three
long
strips
of
garden
each
carefully
tilled
and
separated
from
its
neighbour
by
a
fence
of
wire
netting
the
remains
of
some
dismantled
a
path
of
bricks
salved
from
one
of
the
dilapidated
stables
of
the
mansion
ran
down
the
middle
of
the
nearest
and
in
the
centre
of
it
two
children
sat
playing
in
the
sun
a
girl
some
six
years
of
age
and
a
boy
a
little
younger
in
whose
dark
features
abner
could
trace
a
resemblance
to
the
handsome
face
of
george
malpas
them
s
my
youngsters
he
said
carelessly
he
opened
the
gate
and
tweaked
the
girl
s
ear
as
he
passed
well
gladys
he
said
but
neither
of
the
children
seemed
much
moved
by
his
arrival
being
more
interested
in
the
strange
figure
of
abner
whose
progress
up
the
path
they
watched
with
the
vague
suspicion
of
mountain
sheep
that
stare
before
they
plunge
away
through
heather
i
ll
see
if
the
missis
is
in
said
george
mary
he
called
where
s
the
girl
got
to
sit
yourself
the
room
had
once
been
the
kitchen
of
the
great
house
an
enormous
iron
range
was
built
into
the
wall
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
were
racks
and
shelves
which
must
once
have
held
many
dozens
of
plates
the
sun
slanted
through
a
western
window
and
showed
abner
that
the
comfort
of
this
room
lay
in
its
cleanliness
the
iron
range
was
almost
handsome
in
its
massive
shining
bulk
above
the
whitened
hearth
and
in
the
fender
a
bundle
of
green
bracken
was
set
in
an
attempt
at
decoration
the
fronds
of
this
plant
filled
the
room
with
a
warm
and
drowsy
odour
in
a
corner
a
grandfather
clock
with
a
solemn
face
on
which
the
name
of
was
engraved
marked
the
passage
of
time
with
a
slowly
swinging
pendulum
george
malpas
called
his
wife
again
and
from
a
chamber
on
a
lower
level
that
might
well
have
been
a
dairy
a
woman
appeared
and
stood
in
the
doorway
i
ve
put
the
dinner
away
george
she
said
it
s
past
three
o
don
t
you
worry
your
head
about
the
dinner
he
replied
i
ve
brought
this
chap
back
with
me
he
s
coming
to
work
with
us
on
the
water
job
mother
has
a
fancy
she
can
t
take
any
one
in
at
the
buffalo
so
i
ve
arranged
to
give
him
a
lodge
here
you
d
better
put
him
in
the
top
room
i
reckon
you
won
t
find
him
at
first
she
made
no
reply
but
stood
looking
intently
at
abner
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
believe
that
she
was
george
malpas
s
wife
and
the
mother
of
the
two
children
whom
he
had
seen
playing
in
the
garden
she
seemed
too
young
too
slight
little
more
indeed
than
a
young
girl
she
wore
a
clean
apron
of
white
linen
still
creased
from
the
ironing
and
her
straight
chestnut
hair
was
bound
back
plainly
on
either
side
of
her
temples
and
braided
in
heavy
plaits
behind
she
was
tall
and
her
slimness
together
with
the
narrow
apron
made
her
appear
taller
her
brow
was
wide
and
unwrinkled
her
eyes
were
hazel
her
nose
straight
and
slightly
marked
with
golden
freckles
one
would
have
said
that
her
face
represented
the
most
untroubled
calm
if
it
had
not
been
that
her
mouth
was
a
little
sad
only
her
lips
betrayed
the
fact
that
she
had
suffered
she
stood
in
the
shadow
and
looked
at
abner
narrowly
but
did
not
speak
for
she
had
known
enough
already
of
george
s
boon
companions
to
be
a
little
careful
of
them
don
t
stare
at
the
chap
like
that
said
george
irritably
or
he
ll
think
you
re
then
she
spoke
in
a
voice
that
showed
more
refinement
than
could
have
been
expected
her
speech
was
almost
free
from
the
pleasant
burr
of
the
marches
i
dare
say
we
can
manage
she
said
i
ll
see
about
then
she
addressed
abner
directly
what
s
your
name
damn
me
if
i
ever
thought
to
ask
him
muttered
george
abner
told
her
and
she
repeated
it
after
him
abner
well
that
s
a
queer
name
said
malpas
i
don
t
mind
ever
having
heard
it
it
s
out
of
the
bible
george
said
his
wife
out
of
the
bible
is
it
he
laughed
well
that
s
more
in
your
line
than
she
left
them
quietly
to
attend
to
the
details
of
abner
s
room
malpas
still
a
little
restless
took
him
out
again
talking
incessantly
and
showing
him
what
remained
of
the
ancient
features
of
wolfpits
the
line
of
damp
stables
with
boxes
for
thirty
horses
the
that
had
once
been
clipped
to
the
shape
of
peacocks
but
had
now
straggled
into
those
of
monstrous
antediluvian
birds
the
garden
now
a
wilderness
of
nettles
whose
fruit
trees
spilled
their
pulpy
produce
on
the
mossed
paths
from
the
farthest
corner
of
the
garden
they
could
see
the
house
which
from
this
angle
appeared
tall
and
narrow
like
a
tower
with
for
battlements
in
an
upper
window
there
appeared
the
figure
of
a
woman
standing
still
and
gazing
out
over
the
mountain
that
s
mary
putting
your
room
to
rights
said
george
but
he
did
not
call
to
her
he
spoke
to
abner
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
wolfpits
one
was
an
old
woman
mrs
mamble
by
name
the
widow
of
a
labourer
who
had
worked
on
a
neighbouring
farm
she
don
t
properly
belong
to
these
parts
he
said
they
came
from
down
tenbury
way
but
she
s
took
up
with
morgan
and
gladys
and
mary
likes
her
company
he
must
have
been
a
good
chap
in
his
time
for
they
give
her
the
house
the
other
tenant
whom
they
saw
working
in
his
garden
beneath
the
ivied
end
of
the
house
was
another
solitary
creature
an
old
man
named
drew
who
had
worked
as
a
in
the
district
for
more
than
thirty
years
he
too
was
a
foreigner
having
first
come
to
wolfpits
in
charge
of
a
pedigree
devon
bull
in
the
middle
period
of
his
life
he
had
been
employed
in
a
flour
mill
a
few
miles
down
the
valley
of
the
folly
brook
the
new
steam
mills
at
lesswardine
had
robbed
him
of
this
employment
but
not
before
the
constant
carrying
of
heavy
sacks
had
twisted
his
back
to
a
curve
in
which
rheumatism
had
fixed
it
now
he
could
only
walk
with
his
shoulders
bent
so
that
when
he
spoke
he
had
to
raise
his
eyes
staring
up
at
those
who
questioned
him
as
though
his
back
still
bore
the
burden
of
a
phantom
load
all
his
joints
were
swollen
and
knotted
with
rheumatism
his
huge
hands
resembled
the
branches
of
an
ancient
tree
and
his
whole
aspect
staring
with
pale
blue
eyes
beneath
a
tangle
of
reddish
hair
as
yet
untouched
with
gray
was
that
of
a
gnome
and
proper
to
these
inaccessible
mountains
his
life
was
lonely
and
for
this
reason
he
had
never
lost
the
uncouth
speech
of
the
south
hams
from
which
he
had
originally
come
when
they
passed
his
garden
on
their
way
back
george
gave
him
and
he
raised
himself
as
with
infinite
labour
from
his
work
gazing
at
them
with
the
patient
eyes
of
a
yoked
beast
of
burden
he
s
a
rum
old
chap
said
george
you
wait
till
he
s
on
one
of
his
boozing
fits
and
then
you
ll
by
this
time
mary
had
finished
abner
s
room
and
set
the
table
the
children
tired
with
play
had
come
in
and
were
clamouring
for
their
tea
at
the
same
time
the
fourth
member
of
the
malpas
family
arrived
a
yellow
lurcher
bitch
named
spider
who
had
been
absent
on
some
dark
business
of
her
own
and
now
returned
to
gambol
with
little
morgan
on
the
floor
the
children
were
never
tired
of
teasing
this
animal
but
george
who
only
tolerated
her
when
he
himself
went
rabbiting
in
the
evening
generally
treated
her
cruelly
the
dog
fawned
on
him
but
there
was
more
fear
than
affection
in
her
devotion
abner
told
them
the
story
of
tiger
the
children
listened
with
wide
eyes
and
the
mother
looked
at
him
without
speaking
a
fire
of
sticks
crackled
merrily
down
in
the
room
that
abner
had
taken
for
a
dairy
at
last
mary
malpas
brought
in
tea
and
the
children
ate
stolidly
and
shyly
talking
to
each
other
in
whispers
as
though
they
were
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
the
stranger
perhaps
it
was
also
the
presence
of
abner
that
made
george
malpas
take
unusual
notice
of
his
wife
he
treated
her
very
much
as
he
would
have
treated
the
children
or
the
dog
when
the
fancy
took
him
but
his
faintly
patronising
tone
only
appeared
to
embarrass
her
when
she
gave
him
his
tea
he
would
have
kissed
her
but
she
stiffened
slightly
and
even
blushed
so
that
abner
could
see
the
colour
rising
in
her
white
neck
later
she
softened
a
little
from
her
seriousness
and
the
children
too
realising
that
abner
was
no
more
than
an
ordinary
mortal
began
to
raise
their
voices
they
sat
on
with
the
door
open
in
the
mellow
evening
light
and
an
atmosphere
of
homeliness
and
quiet
descended
on
the
room
so
happily
that
morgan
cried
when
his
mother
told
him
that
it
was
time
for
bed
during
all
the
afternoon
she
had
scarcely
spoken
to
abner
and
she
seemed
relieved
to
find
a
chance
of
escape
she
puzzled
him
in
his
life
he
had
only
known
one
woman
intimately
and
that
was
alice
he
could
not
help
comparing
the
two
of
them
the
cleanliness
and
refinement
of
mary
malpas
became
exaggerated
by
this
comparison
instinctively
at
first
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
influenced
by
george
s
treatment
of
her
but
her
aloofness
and
reserve
now
made
him
feel
that
she
was
in
some
subtle
way
superior
he
could
not
say
that
he
liked
her
but
he
wondered
none
the
less
what
she
was
made
of
she
disappeared
upstairs
and
he
and
george
sat
on
smoking
in
the
twilight
the
sun
had
fallen
like
a
plummet
behind
the
western
hills
the
valley
now
lay
in
deep
shadow
and
only
the
upper
air
was
overspread
with
films
of
light
night
fell
down
in
the
valley
a
began
his
mechanical
trilling
over
by
mawne
in
dovehouse
fields
a
hundred
miles
away
another
was
beginning
a
sense
of
new
and
settled
happiness
descended
on
abner
he
had
come
it
seemed
to
another
stage
in
his
pilgrimage
wolfpits
was
not
like
one
of
the
bivouacs
in
which
he
had
sheltered
with
mick
connor
during
this
crowded
week
but
a
resting
place
he
felt
that
the
future
need
not
trouble
him
that
his
feet
were
firmly
planted
on
this
new
soil
the
only
tie
that
held
him
to
the
past
was
the
memory
of
alice
so
strangely
awakened
by
the
presence
of
this
other
and
so
different
woman
he
feared
that
there
could
be
no
such
happiness
for
her
lying
in
bed
in
that
strange
room
he
decided
that
as
soon
as
he
had
earned
some
money
he
would
send
it
to
her
at
least
it
was
his
duty
to
return
her
the
two
sovereigns
that
she
had
slipped
into
his
pocket
when
he
left
her
yet
when
he
remembered
the
life
at
mawne
against
which
he
had
fretted
for
so
long
his
heart
was
thankful
for
this
release
he
fell
asleep
the
twelfth
chapter
next
morning
abner
went
with
george
malpas
to
interview
the
clerk
of
the
works
who
engaged
him
as
a
labourer
at
shillings
a
week
this
man
had
been
as
long
on
the
waterworks
job
as
gunner
eve
himself
year
after
year
he
had
led
a
nomadic
life
moving
from
one
point
to
another
of
the
great
pipe
line
that
stretches
from
the
valley
of
the
dulas
fechen
to
the
reservoirs
above
halesby
the
piece
of
work
on
which
abner
and
his
friends
were
now
engaged
was
no
more
than
the
result
of
one
of
the
last
feeble
struggles
of
the
gods
of
stone
against
their
iron
masters
in
this
part
of
its
course
the
pipeline
crossing
the
swollen
head
waters
of
the
teme
had
been
lodged
upon
a
deposit
of
old
red
sandstone
a
rock
that
was
easily
worked
and
lent
itself
to
barradale
s
plans
a
hidden
leak
caused
possibly
by
some
obscure
subsidence
had
distorted
its
bedding
two
unsuccessful
attempts
had
been
made
to
deal
with
it
and
now
the
engineers
had
decreed
that
the
whole
track
must
be
deflected
northwards
for
half
a
mile
on
to
a
shelf
of
harder
silurian
stone
the
scene
of
these
new
workings
was
placed
at
the
mouth
of
the
valley
some
three
miles
below
wolfpits
and
immediately
under
the
shadow
of
two
hill
bastions
the
high
peak
which
culminated
in
the
earthwork
known
as
castel
ditches
and
a
wide
hog
s
back
known
as
callow
hill
hither
in
the
early
morning
abner
and
george
malpas
would
set
out
together
carrying
the
packets
of
fried
bacon
sandwiches
with
which
mary
supplied
them
overnight
spider
eager
to
follow
them
would
watch
them
go
quivering
with
anxiety
but
george
malpas
had
lately
taken
a
dislike
to
the
dog
and
would
curse
her
if
she
moved
a
step
in
their
direction
throwing
a
stone
that
made
her
scamper
back
into
the
garden
these
morning
walks
were
very
pleasant
to
abner
and
pleasant
too
was
the
sudden
change
from
a
green
solitude
to
the
sight
of
working
men
who
swarmed
in
the
cutting
beneath
their
feet
a
trolley
way
crowded
with
iron
trucks
that
were
reddened
by
rust
and
by
the
sandstone
of
the
dulas
valley
from
which
they
had
come
cut
through
the
workings
and
beside
it
ran
a
deep
trough
cut
ready
to
receive
the
black
iron
pipes
that
were
dumped
along
its
edge
most
of
the
workers
were
old
hands
at
the
game
but
there
remained
a
certain
amount
of
rough
digging
labour
for
which
abner
s
strength
and
his
experience
in
the
colliery
made
him
suitable
this
was
allotted
to
him
by
the
foreman
on
the
first
day
of
his
employment
he
looked
eagerly
for
mick
connor
who
soon
showed
himself
and
appeared
none
the
worse
for
the
debauch
in
which
he
and
curly
atwell
the
huge
had
engaged
he
declared
he
was
seven
pounds
better
for
it
expressing
himself
as
usual
in
terms
of
the
but
abner
saw
from
the
first
that
their
travelling
acquaintance
was
really
at
an
end
during
the
day
s
work
he
did
not
even
see
george
malpas
being
paired
in
his
new
labours
with
a
youth
named
joseph
munn
whose
face
was
disfigured
by
a
these
two
were
set
to
work
at
some
distance
from
the
rest
clearing
the
from
a
shelf
of
rock
where
a
culvert
of
stone
would
soon
be
built
to
carry
storm
water
from
the
slopes
of
callow
chance
had
been
kind
to
abner
in
the
selection
of
his
companion
for
it
soon
appeared
that
joe
munn
was
a
boy
who
had
been
born
in
dulston
and
in
his
early
days
had
even
seen
abner
himself
playing
football
for
halesby
swifts
he
spoke
abner
s
own
speech
he
knew
the
streets
that
were
familiar
to
him
and
a
common
knowledge
of
distant
places
is
a
greater
bond
between
men
than
a
common
knowledge
of
their
fellows
as
far
as
actual
work
was
concerned
abner
might
well
have
had
a
more
satisfactory
partner
for
physically
munn
was
a
typical
product
of
the
at
its
worst
pale
of
face
and
lank
of
limb
he
seemed
indeed
altogether
too
puny
for
the
work
on
which
they
were
engaged
and
only
a
congenital
consciousness
of
being
born
to
labour
induced
him
to
accept
a
state
that
made
demands
above
his
strength
abner
would
sometimes
watch
him
as
he
stood
panting
with
the
sweat
breaking
out
in
beads
along
the
unhealthy
skin
of
his
bossed
forehead
and
matting
the
wisps
of
his
hair
in
the
end
their
partnership
resolved
itself
into
one
in
which
abner
did
most
of
the
work
when
the
foreman
was
not
there
and
he
did
not
grudge
this
for
he
had
strength
enough
for
two
and
so
much
vigour
that
he
enjoyed
the
using
of
it
munn
would
lie
down
in
the
sun
with
his
chin
in
his
hands
watching
abner
at
work
talking
of
famous
that
he
had
seen
or
of
the
excitements
of
dulston
wakes
i
don
t
know
how
you
ever
come
to
find
yourself
on
a
job
like
this
abner
said
one
day
it
was
company
i
wanted
munn
explained
before
i
come
here
i
was
driving
a
traction
injin
down
in
gloucestershire
what
they
call
the
forest
of
dean
that
was
a
place
if
you
like
the
other
chaps
used
to
go
off
into
cinderford
and
leave
me
alone
with
the
engine
up
in
those
woods
lonely
i
went
half
balmy
straight
i
did
yo
d
never
guess
what
it
was
like
i
used
to
start
talking
to
myself
for
company
like
ever
done
that
abner
abner
laughed
of
course
he
had
never
done
that
so
i
went
up
to
the
foreman
and
says
mister
i
can
t
stick
i
couldn
t
say
no
more
i
couldn
t
trembling
like
a
bloody
leaf
what
s
up
with
you
now
he
says
i
wants
company
says
i
what
you
want
is
a
nursemaid
says
he
and
gives
me
my
money
on
the
saturday
then
i
comes
along
here
strike
if
i
wasn
t
glad
to
get
away
from
all
those
trees
and
gunner
eve
he
look
after
me
a
bit
he
s
a
good
chap
the
gunner
ain
t
he
kid
working
with
abner
or
more
exactly
watching
abner
work
joe
munn
recovered
a
little
of
his
broken
spirit
but
the
story
of
its
destruction
was
older
than
his
experience
in
the
silences
of
the
forest
of
dean
his
earliest
days
had
been
spent
in
a
house
in
a
dulston
slum
where
by
an
aged
grandmother
he
had
made
the
pallid
growth
of
a
potato
sprouting
in
a
cellar
thence
he
had
passed
to
the
children
s
ward
of
dulston
workhouse
being
shot
out
at
the
age
of
fourteen
to
make
his
best
of
the
world
even
now
he
laboured
without
knowing
it
under
the
shadows
and
suppressions
of
those
early
days
these
summer
mornings
working
with
abner
were
the
happiest
that
he
had
ever
known
they
became
sound
friends
in
a
partnership
wherein
abner
was
canonised
as
a
hero
and
protector
a
position
which
he
sustained
with
an
amused
tolerance
his
relation
with
george
malpas
remained
equally
happy
they
always
walked
down
to
work
together
in
the
morning
but
after
that
abner
rarely
saw
his
friend
for
wolfpits
held
no
attraction
for
him
and
he
preferred
to
take
himself
when
the
day
s
work
was
over
to
the
pound
house
or
sometimes
to
the
old
people
at
the
buffalo
in
a
few
weeks
abner
s
temporary
lodging
had
become
a
permanency
mary
malpas
in
consultation
with
her
husband
had
settled
the
sum
that
he
should
pay
for
bed
and
keep
and
wolfpits
itself
that
sinister
and
desolate
mansion
had
become
a
pleasant
and
homely
place
at
first
he
never
accompanied
george
on
his
evening
visits
to
the
pound
house
it
pleased
him
better
to
walk
home
up
the
valley
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
and
sluice
his
head
and
back
beneath
a
pump
of
cold
spring
water
that
stood
in
the
deserted
then
mary
would
give
him
his
tea
always
with
the
same
air
of
watchful
and
remote
reserve
and
he
would
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
garden
talking
to
the
children
who
in
the
confidence
of
their
own
secret
alliance
were
gradually
becoming
a
little
more
friendly
or
he
would
play
with
spider
who
had
now
learnt
to
take
a
place
near
his
chair
at
meal
times
in
the
hope
of
being
fed
with
scraps
from
abner
s
plate
sometimes
too
he
would
lean
on
the
fence
watching
old
drew
at
work
in
his
garden
the
old
labourer
was
as
hardy
as
the
knotted
oak
that
he
resembled
his
day
s
work
began
before
dawn
he
had
more
than
three
miles
to
walk
to
the
farm
on
which
he
was
employed
but
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
after
trudging
the
fields
all
day
he
could
never
rest
but
must
be
putting
his
strip
of
garden
in
order
so
intently
that
he
scarcely
had
time
to
answer
abner
s
questions
staring
up
at
him
with
those
patient
eyes
his
wages
which
were
regulated
by
his
age
rather
than
his
capacity
for
labour
were
only
twelve
shillings
a
week
so
that
his
garden
produce
was
really
essential
to
his
life
when
he
had
finished
his
gardening
or
when
the
light
failed
he
would
retire
to
his
kitchen
and
drink
a
crude
sweet
spirit
that
he
distilled
from
turnips
sometimes
at
night
they
would
hear
him
singing
to
himself
the
innumerable
obscene
verses
of
devonshire
then
when
he
could
sing
no
longer
he
would
drag
his
twisted
limbs
upstairs
and
sleep
like
a
log
in
the
certainty
of
waking
before
dawn
to
set
out
on
his
labours
again
his
life
indeed
had
been
so
solitary
that
he
distrusted
any
intrusion
and
abner
had
known
him
and
spoken
with
him
for
many
weeks
before
he
felt
that
his
presence
was
welcome
the
other
tenant
of
wolfpits
he
rarely
saw
though
her
five
years
in
the
old
house
had
made
her
a
confidante
of
mary
and
indeed
her
principal
refuge
in
domestic
emergencies
sometimes
when
he
came
home
at
night
he
would
find
her
talking
to
mary
in
the
kitchen
but
at
the
sight
of
him
she
scuttled
away
so
that
he
saw
no
more
of
her
than
one
sees
of
a
rabbit
s
vanishing
tail
mary
malpas
did
not
evade
him
in
this
primitive
fashion
and
yet
even
when
he
had
been
living
at
wolfpits
for
more
than
a
month
he
felt
that
he
really
knew
her
no
better
than
the
fugitive
mrs
mamble
he
could
find
no
parallel
to
her
in
the
history
of
his
dealings
with
alice
at
mawne
the
thing
for
which
alice
had
been
mostly
concerned
was
her
dignity
as
mistress
of
john
fellows
s
house
and
this
she
had
been
active
to
assert
mary
malpas
on
the
other
hand
had
no
need
to
stand
upon
her
dignity
it
was
instinct
in
the
refinement
of
her
speech
and
even
more
in
her
silence
the
fact
that
her
father
had
been
a
swindler
and
a
suicide
could
never
rob
her
of
it
abner
fancied
for
a
time
that
the
awkwardness
between
them
was
caused
by
the
way
in
which
he
had
been
suddenly
thrust
upon
her
household
he
felt
that
he
might
stand
to
her
as
a
symbol
of
a
new
slight
inflicted
on
her
by
her
husband
otherwise
why
should
she
deny
him
the
least
suspicion
of
human
contact
he
even
made
an
awkward
attempt
to
settle
the
matter
by
asking
her
if
she
would
not
be
better
pleased
if
he
tried
to
find
another
lodging
if
i
m
in
the
way
like
he
told
her
just
you
say
so
and
i
ll
be
why
should
you
think
that
she
said
without
the
least
sign
of
emotion
there
s
no
reason
why
you
should
go
away
if
you
are
she
didn
t
say
that
they
were
glad
to
have
him
though
the
fact
remained
that
his
money
was
useful
to
them
she
didn
t
say
that
they
would
be
sorry
to
lose
him
he
simply
felt
that
she
had
made
him
look
foolish
and
as
this
was
the
usual
result
of
his
dealings
with
her
in
spite
of
her
politeness
and
her
care
for
his
comfort
he
gave
up
trying
to
find
out
what
she
was
made
of
and
settled
down
to
his
life
at
wolfpits
as
though
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
had
always
been
fond
of
dogs
and
children
and
gladys
morgan
and
spider
soon
became
devoted
to
him
morgan
was
evidently
his
mother
s
favourite
and
the
little
girl
soon
took
a
shy
but
definite
fancy
to
abner
wandering
alone
down
the
lane
in
the
hope
of
meeting
him
on
his
way
home
from
work
and
riding
back
to
wolfpits
perched
on
his
shoulder
she
would
watch
him
gravely
while
he
stripped
and
swilled
himself
in
the
stableyard
standing
by
with
a
towel
ready
to
catch
the
beads
of
water
that
sparkled
on
his
eyebrows
and
his
hair
then
hand
in
hand
they
would
wander
round
the
farmstead
visiting
the
pigsties
and
the
barn
in
which
the
fowls
were
housed
and
searching
for
the
nests
of
broody
hens
in
the
hedgerows
she
loved
above
all
things
to
sit
upon
his
shoulder
when
she
carried
home
the
eggs
in
the
small
cup
of
her
hands
she
liked
his
hugeness
and
his
strength
and
rather
despised
morgan
for
the
fact
that
he
was
his
mother
s
boy
in
those
hills
autumn
came
early
and
soon
sunset
brought
with
it
a
hint
of
evening
cold
the
air
of
the
mountains
drooped
upon
the
plain
as
soon
as
the
western
summits
hid
the
sun
and
in
a
little
while
their
evenings
were
of
lamplight
when
abner
trudged
home
at
night
he
could
see
the
linnets
gathering
together
for
their
autumn
flights
hear
the
whir
of
their
wings
and
their
tender
reedy
notes
starlings
southward
bound
swept
the
air
in
wheeling
cohorts
and
swifts
darted
wildly
round
the
chimneys
of
wolfpits
wood
fires
were
lighted
in
the
kitchen
grate
at
night
and
when
abner
had
finished
his
tea
he
would
settle
down
on
the
right
hand
of
the
fireplace
with
a
pile
of
cut
logs
at
his
feet
at
first
he
looked
forward
to
these
evenings
with
some
anxiety
feeling
that
the
presence
of
this
silent
and
as
he
thought
unsympathetic
woman
would
make
him
uncomfortable
but
strangely
enough
this
did
not
happen
the
devotion
of
gladys
put
him
at
his
ease
and
occupied
him
so
much
that
he
did
not
have
to
speak
to
her
mother
when
first
the
fire
was
lighted
mary
malpas
would
move
about
the
house
on
her
own
business
abner
would
hear
her
talking
softly
to
morgan
in
the
scullery
while
gladys
chattered
to
him
in
the
flickering
light
that
filled
the
room
with
moving
shadows
later
like
a
shadow
herself
mary
would
return
with
the
boy
and
settle
herself
softly
in
the
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
morgan
would
struggle
up
on
to
her
knee
and
cuddle
into
his
mother
s
breast
and
gladys
not
to
be
outdone
would
climb
on
abner
s
knee
and
beg
him
to
tell
her
stories
he
knew
no
stories
for
children
for
he
had
never
had
a
mother
to
tell
them
to
him
but
he
would
talk
to
her
about
mawne
and
the
blind
about
the
rabbits
that
lived
in
dovehouse
fields
about
tiger
and
the
excitements
of
the
wakes
with
their
galloping
horses
and
soaring
gladys
had
never
seen
a
fair
and
these
descriptions
fired
her
imagination
most
why
ain
t
there
no
here
mother
she
would
ask
because
there
aren
t
enough
children
to
go
up
in
them
you
ll
see
them
some
abner
ll
take
me
to
see
his
won
t
you
abner
by
this
time
of
the
evening
morgan
curled
up
on
his
mother
s
lap
was
usually
as
sleepy
as
spider
who
lay
like
a
hedgehog
on
the
hearth
between
them
mary
sat
there
hugging
the
child
in
her
arms
and
never
speaking
for
fear
that
she
might
disturb
him
and
gladys
impressed
by
the
silence
of
the
firelit
room
would
snuggle
closer
to
abner
and
talk
to
him
in
whispers
that
her
mother
could
not
hear
they
sat
on
either
side
of
the
fire
in
these
strangely
divided
camps
and
abner
would
become
aware
of
the
beauty
and
placidity
of
this
silent
woman
sitting
still
in
the
gloom
with
firelight
playing
in
her
hair
listening
all
the
time
though
she
did
not
move
unless
it
were
to
touch
with
her
lips
the
forehead
of
her
sleeping
child
he
used
to
watch
her
and
wonder
what
she
was
thinking
he
could
not
help
watching
her
as
she
sat
like
a
statue
staring
at
the
fire
when
she
turned
her
eyes
towards
him
he
would
look
away
he
became
so
used
to
her
silent
company
that
he
could
not
have
been
happy
without
it
the
days
shortened
the
pollard
elms
turned
gold
and
the
rusty
chestnut
leaves
in
the
avenue
fell
of
their
own
heaviness
the
drowsiness
of
summer
had
passed
and
a
new
restlessness
seized
him
he
could
not
be
contented
with
this
peaceful
static
existence
into
which
he
found
himself
sinking
the
silence
of
mary
malpas
lay
on
him
like
a
heavy
spell
he
had
rested
enough
and
could
no
longer
be
contented
to
drowse
before
the
fire
with
a
child
in
his
arms
the
peace
of
wolfpits
could
tempt
him
no
longer
when
the
chill
autumn
air
stimulated
him
to
action
and
the
natural
violence
of
youth
he
felt
that
what
he
wanted
was
the
society
of
men
and
the
pursuits
of
manliness
once
or
twice
he
walked
down
to
chapel
green
in
the
evening
and
drank
a
pint
with
the
labourers
who
gathered
in
the
buffalo
under
the
eye
of
old
mrs
malpas
but
he
found
that
he
couldn
t
get
on
with
her
she
was
always
restrained
and
severe
giving
him
the
impression
that
she
had
taken
a
dislike
to
him
from
the
first
and
when
she
talked
to
him
he
felt
that
she
was
trying
in
her
own
superior
way
to
find
out
exactly
what
her
was
doing
at
wolfpits
even
her
questions
about
the
children
seemed
to
him
to
be
dictated
by
malevolent
curiosity
rather
than
by
affection
he
felt
that
he
was
like
a
child
in
her
hands
and
that
she
could
get
what
she
liked
out
of
him
when
he
went
to
the
buffalo
he
had
expected
to
find
the
cloggers
there
but
they
did
little
more
than
sleep
in
that
dismal
house
going
for
their
pleasures
to
the
relative
gaiety
and
light
of
the
pound
house
where
they
could
do
as
they
liked
with
the
labourers
at
the
buffalo
abner
had
nothing
in
common
he
understood
nothing
of
their
talk
of
crops
and
beasts
and
weather
even
when
he
could
penetrate
the
meaning
of
their
speech
he
gave
the
buffalo
up
as
a
bad
job
and
went
to
the
pound
house
himself
he
used
to
go
along
there
with
george
malpas
as
soon
as
the
whistle
signalled
that
the
day
s
work
was
at
an
end
and
there
in
a
brighter
light
and
in
the
stir
of
a
roaring
business
he
found
an
atmosphere
more
suited
to
his
restless
spirit
sometimes
he
sat
with
george
malpas
but
george
was
a
gloomy
drinker
and
better
company
when
he
was
sober
so
more
often
he
took
his
seat
next
to
gunner
eve
who
drank
nothing
but
spirits
and
sometimes
under
their
influence
would
talk
to
him
of
his
old
days
of
service
in
the
navy
of
blue
pacific
havens
with
brown
women
or
sometimes
of
that
savage
african
river
on
which
he
had
lost
his
eye
that
was
the
kind
of
life
that
abner
wanted
in
the
gunner
s
stories
a
vista
of
adventure
opened
before
him
the
liquor
made
him
think
that
such
was
the
only
life
for
a
man
the
foreman
s
tales
of
amorous
adventure
enthralled
him
therein
lay
the
proper
use
of
women
there
was
only
one
woman
in
the
pound
house
susie
hind
the
fine
strapping
girl
whose
presence
had
disturbed
him
on
his
first
visit
to
the
inn
with
george
mrs
malpas
s
hints
had
led
him
to
believe
that
she
was
an
old
flame
of
george
s
he
found
himself
comparing
her
with
george
s
wife
and
thinking
of
the
silence
and
remoteness
of
mary
he
felt
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
george
had
been
led
away
the
freedom
of
susie
s
manners
had
suggested
that
she
was
attainable
abner
listening
to
the
gunner
s
adventures
brooded
on
this
and
the
more
he
did
so
the
more
desirable
susie
became
there
seemed
to
him
no
reason
why
he
should
not
possess
her
every
night
he
sat
in
the
pound
house
looking
at
her
he
drank
more
than
he
need
have
done
simply
in
order
that
he
might
remain
in
her
presence
this
inflamed
his
imagination
and
magnified
in
his
eyes
the
physical
elegance
which
she
regarded
as
necessary
to
her
calling
but
he
hardly
dared
to
speak
to
her
openly
in
this
concourse
of
men
and
when
she
came
near
him
with
her
bold
but
beautiful
eyes
his
heart
beat
wildly
and
he
could
say
nothing
he
usually
stayed
in
the
alehouse
till
closing
time
and
walked
back
to
wolfpits
through
the
haunted
night
with
george
malpas
who
was
by
this
time
a
little
sentimental
in
one
of
these
walks
he
asked
george
about
his
relations
with
susie
oh
she
s
all
right
you
can
take
my
word
for
that
said
george
with
a
laugh
yo
ve
seen
a
good
bit
of
her
said
abner
all
i
want
to
george
replied
with
a
wink
that
was
invisible
in
the
darkness
abner
was
silent
and
he
continued
you
d
best
go
easy
for
a
bit
though
for
the
time
being
she
s
took
up
with
that
devil
badger
but
that
won
t
last
i
know
our
susie
bless
her
heart
susie
has
her
abner
knew
already
that
there
was
something
between
susie
hind
and
badger
he
had
watched
their
whispers
jealously
often
enough
now
he
began
to
examine
their
intimacies
more
closely
the
general
unpopularity
of
badger
s
occupation
only
helped
to
increase
his
jealousy
when
he
saw
their
hands
meet
over
the
counter
he
felt
that
the
natural
thing
to
do
would
be
to
rise
from
his
seat
take
badger
by
the
neck
and
throw
him
out
of
the
bar
he
measured
the
thickset
keeper
with
a
fighter
s
eye
and
felt
confident
that
he
was
a
match
for
him
meanwhile
he
must
bide
his
time
every
night
he
went
regularly
to
the
pound
house
and
sat
there
waiting
for
his
opportunity
never
doubting
but
that
he
would
get
her
when
the
time
came
by
the
mere
habit
of
his
presence
a
sort
of
relationship
was
established
between
them
for
abner
s
strength
and
his
fairness
pleased
her
and
she
would
sometimes
pause
for
a
moment
in
her
business
standing
close
to
him
with
a
tray
under
her
arm
and
one
hand
on
her
hip
the
gunner
used
to
chaff
her
as
she
stood
there
he
had
done
enough
lovemaking
in
his
young
days
and
now
his
only
attitude
towards
women
was
one
of
jovial
cynicism
no
doubt
the
foreman
thought
that
susie
stayed
because
she
enjoyed
his
teasing
but
abner
knew
better
he
knew
it
was
himself
not
eve
that
susie
was
watching
between
them
unseen
by
the
other
the
air
was
charged
with
potential
passion
like
the
sky
of
a
hot
night
placid
and
slumberous
yet
ready
to
burst
into
lightning
he
could
laugh
at
gunner
eve
this
dry
old
man
who
vainly
imagined
that
he
was
pleasing
her
fancy
she
smiled
at
eve
but
all
the
time
her
smouldering
eyes
were
fixed
on
abner
and
he
knew
that
she
heard
nothing
then
badger
would
come
in
and
handle
her
as
if
he
were
her
master
abner
did
not
even
mind
this
for
he
saw
that
she
was
beginning
to
treat
the
keeper
as
a
habit
and
her
eyes
did
not
caress
him
secretly
he
began
to
feel
that
he
could
afford
to
despise
badger
but
he
hated
him
none
the
less
in
those
days
he
saw
little
of
george
malpas
at
the
pound
house
soon
after
abner
began
to
visit
mainstone
regularly
george
had
transferred
his
custom
to
an
inn
in
lesswardine
abner
did
not
ask
him
why
he
had
done
this
for
to
have
done
so
might
easily
have
compromised
their
friendship
if
george
preferred
to
spend
his
evenings
away
from
his
lodger
s
eyes
well
and
good
on
the
other
hand
he
did
renew
his
travelling
acquaintance
with
mick
connor
who
remained
one
of
the
best
customers
of
the
pound
house
mick
had
always
been
a
generous
drinker
when
he
was
in
low
water
he
was
not
ashamed
of
sponging
on
his
pals
but
in
these
days
he
seemed
never
to
be
short
of
money
and
this
together
with
the
glibness
of
his
tongue
made
him
a
popular
figure
in
the
alehouse
abner
wondered
where
the
money
came
from
for
mick
s
wages
were
the
same
as
his
own
and
though
he
knew
that
the
irishman
was
a
born
gambler
he
could
scarcely
believe
in
the
permanence
of
his
friend
s
luck
quite
by
chance
he
discovered
the
source
of
mick
s
income
one
sunday
morning
he
had
walked
down
to
the
pound
house
followed
by
the
dog
spider
when
mick
fell
in
with
him
by
the
way
he
surveyed
spider
with
a
professional
eye
that
s
a
likely
lookin
dog
said
mick
ay
she
s
all
right
said
abner
give
me
a
bitch
every
time
for
hunt
n
ah
ye
divil
get
away
wud
you
spider
had
suddenly
become
wildly
interested
in
the
irishman
s
person
and
was
jumping
up
and
smelling
at
the
tails
of
his
coat
that
s
a
wise
dog
said
mick
i
d
be
glad
of
a
dog
the
like
of
that
on
a
moonlight
abner
had
guessed
what
he
meant
but
mick
who
could
never
resist
the
chance
of
producing
a
sensation
opened
his
coat
and
showed
him
the
contents
of
a
game
pocket
that
he
had
constructed
by
making
a
slit
in
the
lining
it
was
a
fine
splendid
in
its
chestnut
autumn
plumage
mick
displayed
it
sentimentally
doesn
t
that
make
your
teeth
water
he
said
god
you
could
ate
it
in
your
hand
the
way
it
is
and
that
bird
do
be
worth
a
good
in
craven
where
d
you
get
him
said
abner
you
ask
mr
bloody
badger
mick
replied
with
a
wink
abner
pressed
him
and
he
went
on
to
explain
that
he
and
curly
atwell
and
one
or
two
others
had
developed
a
plan
of
poaching
on
a
commercial
scale
a
man
named
harford
a
rabbit
merchant
in
craven
arms
the
railway
junction
and
over
the
hills
had
arranged
to
deal
with
their
produce
naturally
in
such
a
dangerous
business
he
bought
cheap
and
sold
dear
but
the
proceeds
of
their
sport
were
enough
to
keep
the
whole
gang
in
unlimited
liquor
the
thing
that
they
needed
most
it
s
the
only
way
to
keep
clear
of
the
buttermilk
cure
said
mick
the
way
they
pay
us
in
this
cursed
he
ended
by
pressing
abner
to
join
them
pointing
out
that
spider
would
be
a
useful
ally
and
abner
without
any
hesitation
accepted
he
was
glad
of
anything
with
a
spice
of
adventure
in
it
to
give
vent
to
his
energies
he
didn
t
care
much
about
the
money
even
though
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
yet
been
able
to
send
alice
her
two
pounds
but
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
this
was
another
way
of
getting
even
with
badger
a
feeling
in
which
mick
with
no
more
definite
reason
than
an
instinctive
hatred
of
gamekeepers
concurred
in
this
way
there
began
a
series
of
midnight
adventures
that
were
a
great
joy
to
abner
and
an
even
greater
to
george
s
dog
who
asked
nothing
better
in
her
sport
than
the
help
of
human
allies
on
these
nights
of
misty
moonlight
the
secret
beauty
of
the
smote
on
abner
s
heart
though
he
knew
nothing
of
it
but
that
he
was
happy
in
the
daytime
the
land
was
dead
and
nothing
lived
in
it
but
he
and
his
fellow
men
but
when
evening
came
the
hills
the
woodlands
the
rivers
and
the
upland
wastes
of
heather
tingled
with
life
something
secret
and
timid
that
sunlight
numbed
into
a
protective
sleep
now
stirred
and
wakened
the
voices
of
the
rivers
changed
they
were
no
longer
only
torrents
of
swift
water
but
living
things
trees
that
in
day
were
silent
awoke
and
whispered
in
the
night
amid
miracles
of
nocturnal
beauty
abner
walked
unseeing
he
only
knew
that
he
lived
more
fully
more
intensely
in
the
night
his
senses
quickened
his
eyes
were
like
the
sharp
eyes
of
a
hunting
owl
so
that
he
felt
that
in
daylight
he
had
been
blind
his
ears
were
tuned
to
an
exquisite
degree
of
sensitiveness
the
cracking
of
a
twig
a
distant
step
on
leaves
the
least
tremor
of
a
growing
tree
sent
a
shock
of
alert
pleasure
into
his
brain
and
the
impalpable
cool
mist
of
autumn
sharpened
his
scent
to
a
keenness
that
delighted
him
this
state
of
acute
sensitiveness
was
the
basis
on
which
the
more
than
physical
thrill
of
imminent
danger
was
imposed
the
labourers
who
worked
on
the
farms
of
squire
delahay
s
estate
were
naturally
in
league
with
badger
against
the
depredations
of
these
foreigners
each
of
them
was
himself
a
poacher
in
a
quiet
way
but
they
poached
for
the
pot
rather
than
for
the
market
and
felt
that
the
presence
of
mick
and
his
gang
was
a
menace
to
their
privileges
these
men
if
less
intelligent
were
as
skilled
in
woodcraft
as
the
irishman
himself
and
mick
s
friends
followed
their
craft
in
a
constant
peril
of
discovery
it
was
a
profitable
adventure
abner
soon
found
that
his
wages
were
trebled
grouse
from
the
mountains
pheasants
from
the
spinneys
partridges
from
the
stubbles
all
found
their
way
into
mick
connor
s
bag
and
were
driven
in
a
ragman
s
cart
to
craven
arms
mick
was
content
to
leave
the
rabbits
to
the
labourers
who
spied
upon
him
he
spent
his
money
wildly
it
even
pleased
him
to
treat
badger
to
drinks
in
the
pound
house
bar
knowing
very
well
that
the
keeper
guessed
where
the
money
came
from
in
november
salmon
began
to
run
up
the
barbel
to
meet
the
winter
floods
and
mick
connor
was
more
than
ever
in
his
element
remembering
desperate
days
upon
the
barrow
when
he
was
a
boy
salmon
spearing
was
to
abner
the
most
exciting
pastime
of
all
the
stealthy
approach
to
the
riverside
up
to
his
knees
in
the
ditches
of
the
the
milky
whiteness
of
november
fogs
the
nearing
clamour
of
the
river
roaring
whitely
over
stickles
into
the
salmon
pool
where
it
lay
dumb
and
black
mick
connor
s
hoarse
whispers
the
lumbering
shadow
of
curly
atwell
and
in
the
darkness
the
swirl
of
an
eddy
black
as
ink
ready
mick
would
whisper
and
suddenly
a
flare
of
light
reddening
faces
casting
grotesque
shadows
lighting
the
yellow
making
a
beacon
for
miles
of
dreamy
country
as
though
the
forest
were
aflame
the
night
sounds
vanished
from
abner
s
ears
the
woods
held
their
breath
and
listened
he
could
hear
nothing
of
the
river
s
the
harsh
breathing
of
atwell
and
the
hiss
of
the
colza
flare
by
the
houly
look
at
him
fourteen
pounds
if
he
s
an
ounce
the
shadow
of
a
lifted
arm
against
the
light
a
violent
descent
and
then
a
swirl
in
the
black
water
and
the
great
fish
struggling
on
the
bank
for
mick
connor
never
missed
his
mark
out
with
the
light
and
then
a
sudden
darkness
in
which
the
roar
of
the
stickle
and
the
vague
noises
of
the
trees
returned
this
curious
insulation
the
way
in
which
light
blinded
their
pickets
of
alarm
was
the
great
danger
of
the
glare
in
the
would
always
give
them
away
if
badger
and
his
men
were
on
the
watch
and
one
frosty
night
in
the
middle
of
november
they
had
a
narrow
shave
mick
connor
was
leaning
over
the
bank
with
lifted
spear
when
abner
heard
the
breaking
of
a
stick
a
man
cursed
as
he
floundered
in
a
ditch
not
twenty
yards
away
abner
who
doubted
the
quickness
of
atwell
smothered
the
flare
with
his
hands
it
scorched
the
horny
skin
of
his
palms
but
it
gave
the
signal
of
alarm
on
that
side
of
the
pool
the
current
had
undercut
the
marly
bank
so
that
the
poachers
could
not
be
seen
but
abner
s
ears
recognised
the
sound
of
badger
s
voice
the
keeper
s
party
ran
towards
the
bank
a
single
man
the
foremost
leapt
down
beside
them
shouting
that
he
had
got
them
abner
let
out
from
the
shoulder
in
the
dark
his
fist
met
the
flesh
of
a
man
s
face
the
man
gave
a
cry
for
all
he
knew
it
might
have
been
the
face
of
curly
atwell
but
it
gave
him
a
good
feeling
in
the
dark
for
he
felt
instinctively
that
it
was
badger
s
they
left
their
spear
on
the
bank
plunging
into
the
swift
stickle
above
the
pool
and
found
refuge
in
a
wood
some
one
fired
after
them
he
fired
low
and
the
twigs
snapped
about
them
abner
plunged
on
through
the
wood
he
knew
that
he
was
running
for
his
life
it
was
good
to
be
running
for
his
life
he
went
on
crashing
through
the
undergrowth
of
the
wood
battling
with
saplings
torn
with
briers
laughing
curiously
wildly
exultant
he
did
not
stop
to
think
that
he
had
lost
touch
with
the
others
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
each
must
look
to
himself
he
only
knew
that
he
had
escaped
out
of
the
mouth
of
danger
his
head
spun
with
the
elation
of
his
heart
pumping
blood
into
his
brain
in
that
moment
he
felt
that
he
had
courage
for
anything
and
it
pleased
him
particularly
to
think
that
badger
had
suffered
this
defeat
he
emerged
from
the
woods
into
open
fields
so
calm
under
the
peace
of
night
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
any
human
violence
had
lately
invaded
them
westward
the
quiet
hills
stood
folded
for
the
night
a
gibbous
moon
rose
languidly
above
the
mists
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
field
tingling
to
his
he
forgot
that
his
legs
were
sodden
with
muddy
water
so
splendidly
his
body
glowed
it
was
ridiculous
to
think
of
crossing
the
hills
to
wolfpits
for
it
was
no
more
than
nine
o
clock
this
was
not
a
time
for
sleep
but
for
living
he
turned
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
pound
house
just
before
closing
time
he
reached
it
one
end
of
the
bar
was
full
of
cloggers
to
whom
wigan
joe
was
reeling
off
lancashire
stories
the
other
was
unusually
empty
for
the
gunner
and
most
of
his
company
had
left
the
house
for
want
perhaps
of
mick
connor
who
was
their
principal
entertainer
susie
stood
behind
the
counter
at
the
deserted
end
of
the
bar
swilling
dirty
glasses
wiping
them
one
after
another
and
listening
all
the
time
to
the
clogger
s
stories
many
of
which
she
had
heard
before
the
same
evening
since
wigan
joe
had
a
way
of
running
through
his
repertoire
and
beginning
again
like
an
automatic
when
the
liquor
was
in
him
as
abner
entered
the
bar
mr
hind
appeared
in
the
door
of
the
kitchen
i
m
goin
up
susie
he
said
with
a
jerk
of
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
staircase
two
minutes
to
go
and
then
lock
she
said
all
right
dad
carelessly
never
looking
at
him
for
her
eyes
were
on
abner
night
all
mr
hind
muttered
as
he
disappeared
abner
went
straight
up
to
her
the
mood
of
physical
triumph
and
elation
was
still
on
him
and
she
must
have
known
that
there
was
something
strange
about
him
since
for
the
first
time
she
lowered
her
eyes
i
want
a
word
with
you
susie
he
said
addressing
her
thus
for
the
first
time
best
hurry
up
then
she
said
smiling
it
s
only
two
minutes
afore
we
close
what
are
you
taking
give
us
a
double
gin
he
said
and
while
she
poured
the
limpid
spirit
into
a
clean
glass
he
asked
her
what
she
was
doing
on
sunday
afternoon
she
wouldn
t
answer
him
look
what
good
measure
i
ve
given
you
she
said
handing
him
his
glass
he
put
the
drink
down
on
the
counter
you
re
not
goin
to
put
me
off
like
that
he
said
she
murmured
something
about
mr
badger
damn
you
and
your
badgers
he
said
what
about
then
oh
don
t
be
soft
look
at
the
time

s
just
on
get
on
with
you
the
time
don
t
no
i
couldn
t
she
said
of
course
i
couldn
t
father
s
gone
the
clock
struck
ten
susie
called
time
please
and
the
cloggers
rose
to
go
in
the
middle
of
one
of
wigan
joe
s
most
complicated
stories
they
moved
toward
the
door
in
a
bunch
bidding
to
susie
who
stood
waiting
with
the
key
in
her
hand
abner
stayed
by
the
bar
finishing
his
gin
the
last
echoed
down
the
street
susie
stood
at
the
open
door
waiting
for
him
come
on
do
she
said
it
s
after
why
shouldn
t
i
stay
here
he
said
with
a
laugh
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
why
she
said
with
a
managing
air
that
new
policeman
bastard
s
got
eyes
like
a
is
that
all
he
asked
yes
of
course
that
s
he
came
to
the
door
and
quickly
closed
it
then
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
she
returned
his
kisses
leave
go
of
me
now
she
whispered
go
out
in
the
lane
while
i
lock
up
and
then
come
round
to
the
back
door
but
don
t
make
too
much
row
about
yo
m
not
codding
me
of
course
i
m
she
closed
the
door
after
him
saying
in
a
clear
voice
for
the
benefit
of
the
problematical
constable
he
heard
her
lock
the
door
and
slip
an
iron
bar
across
into
its
sockets
the
lighted
windows
went
black
he
slipped
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
and
stood
waiting
in
the
angle
that
it
made
with
an
outhouse
where
dry
bracken
was
stored
for
a
long
time
as
it
seemed
he
stood
there
staring
at
the
faint
and
frosty
stars
then
the
door
opened
softly
she
did
not
speak
but
he
stole
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
and
entered
the
kitchen
inside
it
was
quite
dark
for
the
shutters
were
closed
and
the
fire
banked
down
he
could
not
see
her
being
only
conscious
of
her
warm
and
fragrant
presence
he
groped
in
the
dark
suddenly
finding
her
face
on
his
own
my
how
cold
you
are
she
whispered
half
an
hour
later
she
let
him
out
into
the
yard
with
more
tender
whispers
of
farewell
and
warnings
that
her
father
slept
lightly
for
a
few
minutes
he
stood
away
from
the
moonlight
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
bewildered
stunned
he
saw
the
white
road
stretching
in
the
direction
of
chapel
green
and
wolfpits
but
it
meant
no
more
to
him
than
if
it
had
led
to
the
world
s
end
he
was
no
longer
a
part
of
the
world
he
towered
above
it
supreme
and
isolated
in
the
flame
of
his
own
throbbing
exaltation
he
had
no
need
of
friends
or
houses
or
rest
no
memory
of
the
past
no
thought
for
the
future
he
stood
there
and
unassailable
a
little
later
he
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
his
feet
were
carrying
him
automatically
over
the
road
toward
the
hills
but
he
was
almost
unconscious
of
his
progress
and
it
filled
him
with
a
sort
of
mild
surprise
when
he
saw
familiar
landmarks
of
the
road
loom
up
before
him
grow
clear
and
fall
away
behind
his
footsteps
rang
upon
the
iron
road
as
though
he
were
shod
with
steel
from
the
brow
of
the
hill
above
wolfpits
he
saw
the
basin
of
the
folly
brook
brimmed
with
mist
the
gables
of
the
house
rose
up
into
the
moonlight
the
hills
stood
black
behind
under
the
heavy
chestnuts
of
the
avenue
it
was
almost
dark
the
water
in
the
ruts
had
frozen
to
a
thin
crust
so
that
the
surface
was
curiously
splashed
with
moonlight
and
with
ice
fifty
yards
in
front
of
him
he
saw
a
figure
moving
with
lurches
from
side
to
side
of
the
lane
at
first
he
thought
it
was
a
stray
bullock
but
there
was
something
human
in
its
movements
and
so
he
leapt
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
old
man
drew
rolling
home
drunk
with
sweet
turnip
from
the
cottage
of
some
friend
the
figure
leaned
for
a
moment
against
a
stone
wall
and
abner
coming
abreast
of
it
saw
that
the
drunken
man
was
george
malpas
hallo
george
what
s
up
he
called
god
abner
is
that
you
george
murmured
thickly
i
haven
t
half
got
a
drop
i
haven
t
the
situation
amused
george
so
much
that
he
shook
with
weak
laughter
come
on
then
old
son
said
abner
taking
him
by
the
arm
strong
as
he
was
he
found
it
difficult
to
steer
a
straight
course
george
having
once
submitted
to
the
direction
of
another
will
now
became
somnolent
abner
almost
had
to
carry
him
up
the
garden
path
a
light
burned
in
the
kitchen
and
on
the
doorstep
mary
stood
waiting
for
them
she
looked
very
frail
and
beautiful
in
the
light
of
candles
from
the
first
her
eyes
had
taken
in
the
situation
and
she
offered
no
spoken
comment
on
it
though
her
mouth
showed
that
she
was
suffering
the
shame
of
the
situation
give
me
a
hand
upstairs
with
him
please
she
said
the
excuses
that
abner
was
ready
to
offer
for
his
friend
died
on
his
lips
between
them
they
directed
the
steps
of
george
upstairs
when
he
reached
the
bedroom
he
stared
about
him
as
though
he
had
never
been
there
before
and
then
giving
the
problem
up
lurched
over
on
to
the
bed
covering
his
head
with
his
hands
we
d
best
get
his
boots
off
said
abner
he
took
the
right
and
mary
the
left
it
was
a
strange
thing
how
they
had
to
wrestle
with
the
leather
laces
and
how
tightly
the
boots
stuck
to
his
inanimate
feet
now
he
s
all
right
said
abner
when
the
job
was
finished
he
ll
come
up
like
a
daisy
in
the
morning
never
fear
she
did
not
reply
to
him
but
stood
with
the
candlestick
in
her
hand
staring
at
her
husband
s
body
will
you
come
downstairs
with
me
please
she
said
abner
had
not
bargained
for
this
he
could
not
think
what
she
wanted
of
him
but
he
could
not
very
well
refuse
her
and
so
he
followed
her
down
the
creaking
stairs
into
the
kitchen
she
put
the
candle
on
the
table
and
faced
him
silently
from
the
other
side
then
she
said
tell
me
all
about
it
please
there
was
nothing
to
tell
her
he
said
that
he
had
found
george
leaning
up
against
a
wall
in
the
avenue
and
helped
him
over
the
last
lap
were

the
pound
house

then

abner
obstinately

said
with
a
gesture
of
scorn
the
woman
at
the
pound
house

blazed
with
a
white
anger
that
devil
that

abner

know
how
do
you
know
how
do
i
know
i
like
that
i
know
because
i
ve
been
with
her
he
thought
it
was
a
fine
and
brutal
thing
to
say
with
the
same
words
he
had
rescued
his
friend
from
an
awkward
suspicion
and
proclaimed
the
thing
that
he
had
been
wanting
to
shout
to
the
stars
on
his
way
home
he
had
been
burning
to
share
his
triumph
with
some
one
george
would
have
heard
it
if
he
hadn
t
been
so
drunk
now
it
was
out
he
had
got
it
off
his
chest
he
stood
there
smiling
and
triumphant
wondering
what
she
could
say
next
so
you
needn
t
vex
yourself
about
poor
old
george
he
said
for
a
second
she
stared
at
him
the
white
anger
died
out
of
her
face
she
became
suddenly
red
her
clenched
fingers
opened
and
she
clutched
at
the
table
then
she
gave
a
sudden
choking
gasp
and
spoke
you
she
said
you
oh
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
it
of
you
what
s
up
with
you
now
he
said
her
body
was
shaken
with
a
fit
of
sobbing
and
she
left
him
staring
in
the
candlelight
the
thirteenth
chapter
next
morning
when
abner
came
downstairs
in
the
dark
he
found
george
making
himself
a
cup
of
tea
in
the
kitchen
that
you
abner
he
said
turning
his
neck
gingerly
as
though
it
hurt
his
head
to
speak
god
it
s
lifting
the
top
of
my
skull
off
this
dose
ll
last
me
for
a
bit
mind
you
i
wasn
t
so
boozed
i
can
t
remember
what
happened
i
should
have
slept
up
against
that
old
wall
if
you
hadn
t
come
along
you
m
a
good
pal
at
this
point
his
voice
gave
out
have
a
spot
of
tea
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
as
usual
they
walked
down
the
valley
together
at
dawn
the
fields
lay
hoary
with
rime
so
that
the
light
of
dawn
was
like
cloudy
moonlight
their
heels
crunched
into
the
brittle
ice
of
the
before
them
on
the
white
road
ran
the
wayward
pattern
of
spider
s
dancing
feet
not
a
bird
sang
the
cold
air
gripped
their
temples
it
was
as
though
winter
were
closing
on
the
world
and
those
who
dwelt
in
it
like
an
iron
vice
dawn
whitened
beyond
castel
ditches
light
without
reflected
from
ice
but
the
steady
walking
thawed
their
limbs
and
george
was
soon
asking
in
a
husky
voice
for
details
of
what
had
happened
the
night
before
something
in
mary
s
attitude
when
they
woke
that
morning
had
struck
him
as
unusual
he
guessed
that
she
had
found
a
new
grievance
and
was
anxious
to
know
what
she
had
said
he
laughed
when
abner
told
him
that
she
had
questioned
him
on
the
subject
of
susie
laughed
till
the
cold
air
choked
him
they
m
all
the
same
the
women
he
said
jealous
that
s
the
top
and
bottom
of
them
what
did
you
tell
her
said
i
hadn
t
seen
you
at
the
pound
god
you
didn
t
say
i
d
been
to
lesswardine
i
dain
t
know
naught
about
and
the
less
you
know
the
better
or
you
ll
be
having
these
women
buzz
round
you
like
flies
you
can
tell
our
mary
what
you
like
but
you
ll
need
to
keep
your
eyes
skinned
with
mother
i
ve
got
to
bide
on
the
right
side
of
the
old
woman
or
it
s
all
up
she
ll
have
it
out
of
you
before
you
know
you
re
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
lower
end
of
the
valley
to
which
the
cloggers
had
lately
transferred
their
work
the
whole
gang
were
now
housed
in
the
buffalo
and
the
other
scattered
cottages
of
chapel
green
but
a
couple
of
tents
were
left
standing
on
the
banks
of
the
folly
brook
and
the
smoke
of
a
went
up
blue
into
the
air
i
can
t
make
mother
out
george
grumbled
here
she
is
with
wigan
joe
and
the
rest
of
them
in
the
house
a
mint
of
money
for
the
asking
and
she
goes
scaring
them
over
to
mainstone
with
her
long
face
if
i
had
the
buffalo
i
d
soon
see
they
spent
their
money
in
the
house
it
s
as
good
as
robbing
me
the
way
she
sends
them
away
she
don
t
want
the
money
but
i
want
it
bad
enough
god
knows
they
parted
when
they
reached
the
workings
george
whistled
to
spider
but
the
dog
only
wagged
her
tail
and
then
dived
into
a
trench
preferring
to
stay
with
abner
munn
appeared
rubbing
his
hands
with
cold
abner
laughed
at
him
put
your
back
into
it
joe
and
you
ll
soon
feel
right
he
said
the
day
s
work
began
a
red
sun
rose
sluggishly
half
frozen
the
light
glinted
on
the
long
line
of
swinging
picks
and
the
sounds
of
the
work
rose
cheerily
in
the
thin
air
very
different
was
this
from
the
subdued
activity
of
summer
the
labourers
did
not
work
only
for
money
but
because
the
exertion
sent
the
blood
tingling
warm
into
their
hands
and
feet
work
was
an
ecstasy
and
to
abner
a
greater
ecstasy
than
to
the
rest
of
them
he
thought
of
susie
and
of
the
night
before
he
whistled
as
he
worked
for
sheer
physical
joy
rejoicing
in
his
strength
for
now
once
more
after
months
of
soft
disuse
his
body
was
finding
its
right
expression
and
coming
splendidly
to
its
own
he
stretched
his
limbs
in
the
sunlight
recapturing
the
moments
of
physical
exaltation
that
used
to
come
to
him
when
the
mawne
united
team
stepped
out
on
to
the
smooth
turf
of
the
albion
ground
a
company
of
clean
and
splendid
athletes
and
all
the
time
beneath
the
pleasant
anodyne
of
work
his
body
glowed
with
a
rich
contentment
knowing
that
in
a
few
hours
night
would
come
and
susie
be
clinging
in
his
arms
again
he
had
no
fear
that
she
would
forsake
him
he
felt
in
every
fibre
of
his
body
that
he
was
a
match
and
more
than
a
match
for
badger
having
once
attained
her
he
knew
that
he
could
keep
her
and
in
this
he
was
not
deceived
for
susie
having
looked
on
him
and
found
that
he
was
good
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
and
now
kept
pace
with
his
passion
asking
as
much
as
he
could
give
every
evening
as
was
already
his
custom
he
would
go
to
the
pound
house
and
take
his
seat
beside
gunner
eve
but
now
he
no
longer
needed
to
follow
susie
with
his
eyes
was
no
longer
tortured
with
vague
jealousies
for
when
she
passed
him
he
could
feel
her
soften
and
respond
to
his
presence
sometimes
when
no
one
was
looking
she
would
turn
her
head
in
his
direction
and
for
a
moment
their
eyes
would
meet
he
did
not
care
when
men
spoke
to
her
lightly
or
placed
their
hands
upon
her
arm
for
now
he
knew
that
she
belonged
to
him
and
could
be
his
for
the
asking
the
events
of
the
first
night
were
repeated
many
times
now
a
single
whisper
was
enough
to
ensure
that
when
the
alehouse
was
empty
and
mr
hind
safely
in
bed
the
kitchen
door
would
be
opened
softly
and
susie
waiting
for
him
in
the
warm
darkness
it
amused
abner
to
see
the
coldness
that
she
now
showed
toward
badger
the
keeper
was
puzzled
for
all
their
was
secret
and
nocturnal
and
susie
and
abner
never
appeared
in
public
together
badger
knew
that
for
some
unknown
reason
he
had
lost
her
and
this
made
him
more
persistent
than
ever
in
his
attentions
being
far
too
important
in
his
own
estimation
to
be
discarded
without
good
reason
abner
laughed
to
see
his
irritation
he
and
susie
laughed
together
in
the
night
i
can
t
imagine
whatever
i
saw
in
him
she
said
at
the
end
of
november
susie
went
away
for
a
week
to
stay
with
her
grandparents
in
hereford
without
her
the
pound
house
meant
nothing
to
abner
and
without
considering
that
his
absence
might
be
noticed
he
drifted
back
into
his
old
habit
of
returning
to
wolfpits
in
the
evening
it
was
now
more
than
a
month
since
he
had
done
this
and
in
the
interval
he
had
scarcely
spoken
to
mary
malpas
returning
and
expecting
to
pick
up
the
threads
of
the
old
life
exactly
as
he
had
left
them
he
was
surprised
to
find
the
atmosphere
of
wolfpits
curiously
changed
the
attitude
of
mary
herself
was
cold
and
unfriendly
he
found
it
difficult
to
make
headway
against
it
for
she
scarcely
spoke
to
him
and
even
the
children
seemed
to
have
become
infected
with
their
mother
s
distrust
it
was
true
that
they
had
seen
so
little
of
him
as
almost
to
have
forgotten
him
but
it
seemed
strange
that
his
old
favourite
gladys
no
longer
came
instinctively
to
his
arms
he
could
not
accept
the
change
without
a
protest
one
evening
finding
mary
alone
he
tackled
her
what
s
come
over
you
he
said
nothing
s
come
over
me
what
do
you
mean
she
replied
coldly
yo
m
different
like
you
was
scared
of
me
what
have
i
done
you
know
best
you
know
what
you
told
me
that
night
she
said
with
tight
lips
that
s
nothing
to
do
with
you
he
said
no
then
what
s
up
with
you
she
laughed
uneasily
and
went
into
the
scullery
abner
was
seized
with
sudden
rage
it
didn
t
surprise
him
that
george
couldn
t
get
on
with
her
mrs
malpas
was
right
she
was
trying
to
play
the
lady
with
him
with
a
woman
like
that
it
was
useless
trying
to
be
frank
he
could
read
suspicion
into
everything
that
she
did
when
gladys
who
was
now
regaining
her
confidence
climbed
on
to
his
knee
she
followed
the
child
with
anxious
eyes
as
though
she
feared
that
he
would
corrupt
her
he
determined
to
have
the
matter
out
with
her
but
she
never
gave
him
a
chance
arranging
carefully
that
they
should
never
be
alone
for
this
or
for
some
other
obscure
reason
she
always
invited
her
neighbour
mrs
mamble
to
come
in
and
sit
with
her
in
the
evening
this
old
woman
innocent
of
the
strange
relation
between
them
would
sit
in
front
of
the
fire
talking
incessantly
of
her
dead
husband
and
her
distant
relatives
down
tenbury
way
she
had
a
brother
who
kept
a
small
shop
in
a
hamlet
called
far
forest
and
was
never
tired
of
talking
of
his
importance
as
an
elder
of
the
local
wesleyan
synod
and
the
achievements
of
her
nephew
james
whom
his
father
had
destined
for
the
ministry
the
old
woman
tried
to
entertain
them
both
with
these
recitals
but
abner
had
little
patience
with
her
and
tried
to
forget
that
she
was
there
he
sat
reading
the
football
news
in
the
last
sunday
s
but
even
this
could
not
shut
out
the
sound
of
her
slow
insistent
voice
one
night
he
asked
for
pen
and
paper
and
wrote
a
short
but
laborious
note
to
alice
enclosing
a
postal
order
for
two
pounds
which
he
had
bought
in
chapel
green
mary
watched
him
all
the
time
that
he
was
writing
ah
yo
m
curious
bain
t
yo
he
thought
pretending
to
take
no
heed
of
me
but
yo
d
give
your
eyes
to
see
what
i
ve
indeed
she
offered
to
post
the
letter
for
him
but
he
declined
putting
it
in
his
pocket
with
a
laugh
in
the
end
he
found
these
evenings
at
wolfpits
so
uncomfortable
that
he
was
glad
when
mick
connor
inveigled
him
into
a
new
expedition
against
badger
s
preserves
by
this
time
the
keeper
had
looked
about
him
and
made
plans
for
defending
his
master
s
property
so
that
the
game
was
getting
more
dangerous
every
day
badger
had
made
friends
with
constable
bastard
the
new
policeman
who
had
been
drafted
to
mainstone
from
shrewsbury
and
looked
upon
poaching
with
the
uncharitable
eye
of
a
townsman
to
the
great
embarrassment
of
mr
hind
who
not
unreasonably
lived
in
terror
of
the
licensing
justices
and
had
not
yet
determined
in
what
degree
the
new
policeman
was
corruptible
bastard
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
customers
of
the
pound
house
poking
his
whiskered
face
inside
the
taproom
every
evening
and
taking
count
of
the
company
like
a
shepherd
numbering
his
sheep
mr
hind
s
heart
sank
when
he
found
that
the
constable
was
a
teetotaller
the
appearance
of
bastard
s
face
in
the
doorway
made
him
tremble
for
his
licence
though
these
visits
only
meant
that
the
keeper
and
the
policeman
were
working
together
hoping
to
identify
the
authors
of
each
poaching
outrage
by
establishing
their
absence
from
the
pound
house
the
first
expedition
in
which
abner
took
part
during
susie
s
visit
to
hereford
gave
them
a
big
haul
abner
s
own
share
of
it
was
fifteen
shillings
and
thus
encouraged
they
raided
the
keeper
s
preserves
on
three
nights
in
succession
the
constable
checking
the
tale
of
drinkers
at
the
pound
house
pointed
out
that
abner
mick
curly
atwell
and
another
had
been
absent
on
each
of
the
nights
in
question
and
that
mick
had
celebrated
his
return
by
recklessly
standing
treat
to
the
whole
taproom
that
young
fellows
said
bastard
he
s
not
been
nigh
the
place
for
more
nor
a
week
for
myself
i
d
say
that
he
looks
a
quiet
chap
but
you
never
know
upon
my
word
you
don
the
simpler
they
looks
said
badger
emphatically
the
more
they
wants
an
eye
kept
on
them
i
m
pretty
near
certain
i
saw
him
that
night
they
was
arter
the
never
you
fear
said
the
constable
i
ll
keep
an
eye
on
the
it
never
occurred
to
badger
whose
energies
were
centred
for
the
present
on
one
problem
to
connect
abner
s
absence
from
the
pound
house
with
susie
s
visit
to
hereford
he
was
an
obstinate
and
not
very
intelligent
man
in
mind
as
in
body
who
had
learnt
his
own
craft
thoroughly
and
knew
little
else
he
had
become
aware
of
susie
s
coldness
toward
him
before
her
departure
but
he
had
not
thought
to
explain
it
by
her
fancying
another
man
in
any
case
the
matter
might
wait
he
could
only
do
one
thing
at
a
time
and
for
the
present
he
was
too
busy
with
mick
and
his
friends
to
waste
good
time
in
dangling
round
the
pound
house
perhaps
it
was
only
that
susie
wanted
more
fuss
made
of
her
all
in
good
time
after
ten
days
she
returned
and
abner
began
to
visit
the
pound
house
again
he
found
her
imperious
and
exacting
she
could
not
see
too
much
of
him
bastard
reported
him
to
badger
as
a
regular
attendant
at
the
inn
you
needn
t
trouble
about
that
young
fellows
he
said
he
s
after
other
there
s
no
game
here
to
speak
on
but
ours
said
badger
stupidly
ah
it
s
a
different
kind
i
mean
said
the
constable
that
girl
of
hind
s
is
looking
after
him
any
night
of
the
week
if
you
want
to
see
a
picture
you
can
watch
her
take
him
in
by
the
back
door
when
the
old
man
s
asleep
badger
went
livid
and
swore
so
violently
as
to
shock
the
constable
s
principles
i
don
t
believe
it
he
said
not
a
word
of
seeing
s
believing
said
bastard
at
any
rate
seeing
s
good
enough
for
all
thought
of
the
poachers
vanished
from
badger
s
single
mind
he
left
the
constable
in
the
middle
of
their
conversation
and
went
straight
to
the
pound
house
where
he
found
susie
alone
making
a
petticoat
from
a
pattern
that
she
had
bought
in
hereford
she
could
see
by
his
stormy
entrance
that
something
had
upset
him
and
switched
on
her
most
ingratiating
manner
well
it
is
a
time
since
i
ve
seen
you
mr
badger
she
said
laying
aside
her
work
will
you
have
something
he
wouldn
t
drink
he
refused
to
waste
time
in
preliminary
skirmishing
you
re
not
going
to
get
round
me
that
way
he
said
what
s
this
about
you
and
that
chap
fellows
fellows

t
start
that
game
on
me
said
badger
angrily
i
ve
seen
there
was
something
up
with
you
for
the
last
month
now
i
know
what
it
is
you
can
t
go
on
like
that
with
me
i

not
that
kind
of
and
i
m
not
that
kind
of
girl
mr
badger
said
susie
i
thought
better
of
you
indeed
i
you
can
drop
all
that
said
badger
with
a
laugh
you
can
let
on
you
re
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
but
i
know
better
understand
that
if
that
s
what
you
mean
i
can
tell
you
straight
i
m
not
going
to
listen
to
your
dirty
tongue
i
m
not
accustomed
to
be
spoke
to
by
my
friends
like
she
rose
indignantly
and
would
have
gone
into
the
kitchen
but
he
caught
hold
of
her
arm
you
don
t
deny
it
he
said
i
wouldn
t
demean
she
tried
to
wrench
away
from
him
but
he
would
not
let
her
go
the
warmth
of
her
arm
on
his
fingers
made
him
mad
he
wanted
to
use
her
roughly
she
cried
out
with
pain
don
t
she
cried
you
re
hurting
me
he
wanted
to
hurt
her
he
only
held
her
tighter
where
s
your
father
he
said
father
s
gone
out
she
said
oh
let
me
go
gone
out
is
he
well
i
ll
have
a
talk
to
him
about
this
when
he
comes
back
then
we
ll
see
you
can
tell
him
all
the
dirty
lies
you
like
she
said
defiantly
but
in
reality
his
words
had
thrown
her
into
a
state
of
terror
that
squat
father
of
hers
was
the
one
person
on
earth
whom
she
dreaded
it
came
over
her
suddenly
that
somehow
or
other
she
must
prevent
his
knowing
for
though
he
had
no
objection
to
his
daughter
being
free
with
men
for
the
good
of
the
house
she
knew
that
he
was
anxious
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
badger
and
would
be
furious
to
think
that
she
had
taken
up
with
a
labouring
man
somehow
she
must
flatter
the
keeper
out
of
his
intention
but
she
knew
that
a
sudden
change
of
front
would
be
a
manœuvre
too
transparent
it
pleased
her
therefore
to
give
vent
to
the
emotions
which
she
had
so
far
controlled
and
to
break
down
in
the
most
natural
tears
she
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
and
sobbed
violently
badger
was
bewildered
by
this
but
still
determined
you
don
t
get
over
me
that
way
he
said
not
if
i
know
it
she
went
on
sobbing
and
the
spectacle
began
to
get
on
his
nerves
you
can
cry
your
eyes
out
my
girl
but
i
m
going
to
tell
your
she
raised
her
eyes
it
s
not
that
she
said
violently
you
can
tell
him
any
lie
you
like
and
it
won
t
make
no
difference
to
me
what
i
can
t
stand
is
that
you
should
think
it
of
me
that
you
should
think
i
d
go
with
a
common
chap
like
that
it
s
cruel
mr
badger
cruel
after
the
friends
we
ve
been
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
looked
at
him
pleading
his
lust
got
the
better
of
him
and
he
took
her
violently
in
his
arms
she
submitted
and
he
began
to
forget
his
suspicions
she
clung
to
him
so
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
that
she
was
desirable
then
cunningly
gradually
she
became
playful
and
childish
teasing
him
indignant
that
he
should
have
thought
so
ill
of
her
by
the
time
that
he
left
her
she
had
convinced
him
that
nothing
could
spoil
their
intimacy
but
whatever
she
pretended
she
could
not
shake
herself
free
from
the
fright
he
had
given
her
she
felt
that
the
time
would
never
pass
till
she
could
see
abner
and
warn
him
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
when
the
evening
came
and
she
began
her
work
in
the
bar
moving
among
the
drinkers
with
her
usual
smiling
freedom
badger
was
also
there
following
her
with
hungry
eyes
as
she
went
about
her
work
he
sat
in
a
corner
isolated
for
none
of
the
strangers
would
have
anything
to
do
with
him
while
serving
a
tot
of
gin
to
gunner
eve
she
contrived
to
whisper
to
abner
begging
him
to
keep
away
from
the
house
that
night
why
what
s
up
he
said
i
can
t
tell
you
she
whispered
come
early
before
it
s
light
on
your
way
to
work
just
to
please
me
she
spoke
so
urgently
and
with
such
evident
distress
that
he
obeyed
her
and
badger
who
had
seen
her
bending
over
to
speak
to
abner
spent
a
cold
night
watching
the
back
of
the
pound
house
in
vain
he
might
well
have
been
better
employed
for
while
he
stood
there
shivering
mick
connor
made
free
with
half
a
dozen
of
his
pheasants
next
morning
in
the
half
light
of
dawn
which
made
the
cold
kitchen
look
unspeakably
sordid
she
received
abner
the
meeting
had
none
of
the
warm
glamour
of
their
nightly
and
her
anxiety
made
him
impatient
what
the
hell
do
i
care
for
badger
he
said
oh
quiet
quiet
don
t
speak
so
loud
she
implored
him
she
submitted
to
his
embraces
but
her
mind
was
not
with
him
i
can
t
think
what
s
up
with
you
he
said
his
unconcern
irritated
her
can
t
you
understand
she
said
it
s
better
to
do
without
me
for
a
little
than
to
lose
me
for
good
that
s
what
would
happen
if
father
knew
he
d
send
me
away
to
hereford
to
grandma
s
that
s
what
he
d
do
only
for
a
week
abner
after
that
when
he
s
forgotten
about
it
things
ll
be
her
distress
was
so
real
and
she
seemed
so
little
to
belong
to
him
in
her
present
state
that
he
consented
not
to
see
her
for
a
week
then
i
shan
t
come
a
nigh
the
place
he
said
i
m
not
goin
to
sit
there
looking
at
you
and
nothing
yes
that
would
be
best
she
said
gladly
it
inflamed
him
to
think
that
she
could
take
this
complete
divorce
so
calmly
better
finish
it
off
he
said
then
she
clung
to
him
no
no
abner
i
couldn
t
bear
that
only
a
week
my
love
only
a
week
he
kept
to
his
side
of
the
bargain
and
badger
was
relieved
to
see
him
no
more
at
the
pound
house
although
the
suddenness
of
abner
s
abstention
coloured
his
suspicions
what
with
his
pheasants
and
the
woman
the
keeper
s
life
was
becoming
too
complicated
for
his
intelligence
for
mick
profited
by
badger
s
new
devotion
to
susie
by
ravaging
his
coverts
in
this
abner
who
had
no
other
way
of
killing
time
joined
his
friend
and
on
the
last
night
of
the
week
came
a
sharp
but
bloodless
encounter
in
which
the
keeper
was
more
than
ever
certain
that
he
had
seen
abner
s
face
after
this
it
became
fixed
in
badger
s
mind
that
abner
was
his
principal
enemy
the
man
who
was
obstinately
working
against
him
wherever
he
went
somehow
or
other
he
determined
he
must
get
the
better
of
him
on
the
night
when
abner
returned
to
the
pound
house
badger
was
already
there
mick
as
usual
after
a
successful
foray
was
spending
money
freely
and
by
nine
o
clock
the
room
was
full
of
excited
men
abner
was
ready
to
drink
with
the
best
of
them
for
his
pockets
were
full
of
money
and
he
had
not
been
inside
a
pub
for
a
week
to
add
to
this
uproarious
assembly
in
came
george
malpas
returning
early
from
his
own
dark
business
in
lesswardine
go
easy
boys
he
said
as
he
entered
that
damned
copper
s
but
mick
connor
had
by
now
gone
too
far
to
go
easy
the
liquor
which
in
the
early
stages
of
intoxication
merely
rendered
him
funny
now
made
him
boastful
and
the
sight
of
badger
glowering
in
his
corner
over
a
hot
whisky
provided
him
with
a
subject
for
his
wit
atwell
tried
to
keep
him
within
bounds
but
mick
once
fairly
nourished
could
talk
the
cross
off
an
ass
s
back
the
laughter
with
which
his
sallies
at
the
keeper
s
expense
were
greeted
stimulated
him
he
plunged
into
wild
excesses
of
simile
while
badger
sat
sipping
his
whisky
going
redder
and
redder
as
he
listened
he
knew
that
the
whole
room
was
against
him
felt
that
before
long
he
must
do
something
to
assert
himself
if
he
went
out
into
the
road
he
would
only
be
laughed
at
but
no
man
could
sit
there
listening
to
mick
connor
without
shame
wait
while
i
m
tellin
you
said
mick
over
in
connemara
there
used
to
be
an
old
gent
named
hewish
a
proper
old
sportsman
it
was
he
that
invented
that
game
i
ve
told
you
of
spider
racing
spiders
burning
the
legs
off
of
them
on
a
hot
plate
too
and
i
m
after
tellin
you
that
s
the
sport
for
a
man
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
him
and
so
say
all
of
us
said
mick
insolently
staring
into
badger
s
corner
badger
pushed
aside
the
table
and
rose
to
his
feet
his
glass
went
down
with
a
crash
oh
mr
badger
susie
cried
gard
the
baste
s
afther
turning
on
me
cried
mick
all
together
boys
badger
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
to
mick
the
irishman
lowered
his
head
and
butted
him
in
the
stomach
like
a
ram
badger
falling
saw
abner
s
smiling
face
and
lashed
out
at
it
the
two
men
went
down
together
fighting
on
the
floor
susie
rushed
into
the
kitchen
calling
for
her
father
and
at
the
same
moment
the
constable
ran
into
the
room
he
began
to
try
and
pinion
abner
who
had
badger
on
the
floor
leave
them
alone
cried
george
malpas
excitedly
badger
hit
him
first
he
took
hold
of
the
policeman
s
shoulder
and
tried
to
pull
him
back
do
you
know
what
you
re
doing
bastard
shouted
obstructing
my
duty
but
george
would
not
let
him
go
the
policeman
left
abner
and
closed
with
malpas
he
was
the
taller
but
the
older
man
they
swayed
in
each
other
s
arms
and
then
tripping
on
the
leg
of
an
overturned
chair
went
down
together
the
policeman
was
undermost
and
his
head
hit
the
stone
floor
with
a
dull
thud
george
who
had
fallen
above
him
freed
himself
from
his
arms
the
s
stunned
said
atwell
serve
him
right
mr
hind
had
appeared
on
the
scene
and
was
bending
over
the
prostrate
policeman
george
leaned
panting
against
the
bar
there
s
blood
coming
from
his
ears
and
nose
mr
hind
said
hoarsely
the
s
stunned
atwell
repeated
stolidly
he
s
not
stunned
said
the
landlord
looking
up
he
s
dead
by
this
time
abner
had
got
the
better
of
the
keeper
whom
he
held
beneath
him
on
the
floor
he
heard
the
crash
as
george
malpas
and
constable
bastard
went
over
amid
a
hubbub
of
voices
then
with
the
landlord
s
words
which
abner
did
not
hear
fell
a
sudden
silence
he
wondered
what
was
up
released
badger
and
pushed
forward
to
the
cluster
of
men
that
surrounded
the
policeman
s
body
he
heard
the
word
dead
passing
from
one
to
another
lock
at
the
blood
coming
out
of
his
ear
they
said
and
there
was
george
malpas
leaning
up
against
the
bar
with
his
hands
behind
him
gripping
it
ghastly
pale
and
panting
with
his
mouth
open
and
twitching
at
the
corners
he
didn
t
see
abner
or
any
one
else
a
curious
inertia
had
fallen
on
the
group
of
men
about
bastard
s
body
they
simply
stared
at
it
as
though
it
had
fallen
into
the
midst
of
them
from
another
planet
mr
hind
by
way
of
an
experiment
lifted
the
constable
s
hand
and
let
it
fall
again
it
fell
on
the
floor
with
a
wooden
sound
somebody
run
to
lesswardine
for
the
doctor
said
mr
hind
i
ll
go
myself
said
abner
that
s
right
tell
im
about
the
blood
and
be
s
quick
as
you
it
s
snowing
some
one
called
abner
went
hatless
to
the
door
looking
back
into
the
kitchen
he
saw
the
face
of
susie
it
was
white
like
a
mask
for
the
moment
it
meant
nothing
to
him
they
looked
at
each
other
for
that
fraction
of
a
second
unrecognising
abner
started
running
toward
lesswardine
the
hard
road
echoed
the
night
was
deadly
black
and
snow
was
falling
he
scarcely
noticed
the
snow
he
went
on
plodding
over
the
road
to
lesswardine
without
realising
for
the
time
the
importance
of
his
journey
he
felt
the
snowflakes
spatter
his
face
his
neck
his
chest
for
in
the
struggle
with
badger
his
shirt
had
been
torn
open
he
was
glad
he
had
come
to
grips
with
badger
he
felt
he
could
do
what
he
liked
with
the
keeper
now
the
vision
of
susie
till
then
unrealised
came
back
to
him
out
of
the
darkness
scared
she
must
have
been
in
lesswardine
yellow
lamps
beamed
through
halos
of
cold
air
crossing
the
bridge
he
saw
that
his
clothes
were
as
white
as
a
miller
s
the
great
flakes
danced
like
moths
in
the
lamplight
they
flew
into
his
mouth
and
melted
on
the
heat
of
his
tongue
his
feet
did
not
echo
in
these
new
streets
for
the
macadam
was
felted
with
an
inch
of
snow
he
had
nearly
reached
his
goal
it
was
senseless
to
go
on
running
panting
and
swallowing
mouthfuls
of
snow
but
his
legs
would
not
obey
these
thoughts
and
carried
him
onwards
the
doctor
was
smoking
his
pipe
when
abner
arrived
the
hinds
were
good
patients
and
he
did
not
hesitate
to
turn
out
give
me
a
hand
with
the
mare
he
said
and
they
went
out
into
the
stable
to
put
to
the
doctor
s
wife
had
warmed
his
overcoat
and
wrapped
a
muffler
round
his
neck
he
gave
abner
a
peg
of
whisky
to
keep
him
warm
when
they
were
clear
of
the
lesswardine
lights
he
asked
for
details
of
the
affair
by
gad
that
s
serious
he
said
that
means
an
inquest
and
a
he
thought
to
himself
two
guineas
and
touched
up
the
mare
with
satisfaction
you
say
bastard
and
george
malpas
went
down
together
he
was
struggling
with
george
was
me
and
badger
he
was
that
s
beside
the
point
said
the
doctor
it
s
a
bad
lookout
for
for
his
mother
poor
old
lady
a
bad
lookout
it
s
the
fourteenth
chapter
by
the
time
that
abner
and
the
doctor
reached
mainstone
bastard
s
body
was
growing
cold
and
the
last
hope
that
his
unconsciousness
was
any
less
than
that
of
death
had
vanished
the
pound
house
was
still
full
of
those
who
waited
for
the
verdict
a
silent
sober
company
mr
hind
who
had
not
seen
the
beginning
of
the
struggle
tried
vainly
to
find
out
what
had
happened
all
accounts
of
it
were
confused
and
contradictory
and
in
any
case
it
mattered
little
to
the
landlord
for
he
knew
that
his
house
was
already
in
the
black
books
of
the
police
and
felt
sure
that
this
catastrophe
would
mean
the
loss
of
his
licence
the
doctor
scarcely
needed
to
look
at
bastard
s
body
yes
fractured
base
he
said
he
must
have
died
at
once
an
elderly
man
with
brittle
bones
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
hind
i
ll
knock
up
the
sergeant
when
i
get
back
to
lesswardine
and
telephone
the
i
wouldn
t
have
had
this
happen
for
nothing
doctor
moaned
mr
hind
of
course
you
wouldn
t
it
s
not
your
he
must
have
tripped
over
that
and
everybody
including
the
doctor
stared
at
the
offending
piece
of
furniture
with
interest
come
on
abner
said
george
malpas
mr
mr
hind
did
not
reply
all
through
that
night
the
snow
fell
slowly
incessantly
the
soft
frozen
sky
drifted
downward
idly
on
the
land
and
george
and
abner
had
to
pick
their
way
back
to
wolfpits
blindly
in
the
small
hours
guided
through
the
plain
by
the
presence
of
ghostly
trees
and
in
the
wolfpits
valley
by
the
tumult
of
the
folly
brook
the
hills
were
desolate
and
savage
they
lay
dead
and
the
sky
covered
them
wolfpits
itself
rose
before
the
travellers
eyes
sudden
and
black
through
the
falling
snow
there
was
no
light
in
any
of
the
windows
for
mary
had
given
them
up
long
ago
and
gone
to
bed
wood
embers
smouldered
in
the
kitchen
grate
george
poked
them
into
a
blaze
they
took
off
their
coats
and
sat
in
front
of
the
fire
well
this
is
a
bloody
fine
thing
said
george
old
bastard
gone
and
me
a
murderer
i
ve
looked
for
some
queer
things
but
never
for
i
reckon
it
s
my
fault
said
abner
that
s
bound
to
come
that
s
not
going
to
help
me
said
george
with
a
laugh
not
it
it
s
mother
i
m
thinking
of
there
s
no
luck
in
our
family
it
s
no
good
talking
about
it
it
s
my
last
fling
and
i
d
do
it
again
for
a
pal
if
it
hadn
t
happened
it
wouldn
t
never
have
happened
at
abner
could
say
nothing
even
now
he
didn
t
realise
the
seriousness
of
his
friend
s
position
just
my
blasted
luck
said
george
better
turn
in
unless
you
want
to
get
he
went
upstairs
with
his
candle
and
abner
followed
when
daylight
returned
the
snow
had
ceased
but
the
night
s
fall
had
obliterated
the
track
of
their
returning
feet
wolfpits
had
become
a
black
island
in
the
surrounding
whiteness
from
the
drift
upon
the
doorstep
the
snow
lay
smooth
to
the
tops
of
the
hills
which
dawn
illumined
with
a
rosy
light
never
had
the
mountains
seemed
so
near
to
the
house
so
beautiful
and
so
little
threatening
abner
woke
early
and
looked
out
on
this
transfigured
world
in
all
the
house
no
one
was
astir
even
old
drew
who
worked
in
all
weathers
had
not
yet
emerged
from
his
snowbound
door
george
and
mary
still
slept
it
was
very
cold
and
abner
threw
his
coat
over
his
bedclothes
it
was
no
good
getting
up
for
he
knew
that
with
so
deep
a
fall
there
could
be
no
work
on
the
that
day
he
lay
in
bed
smoking
watching
the
clustered
chimneys
of
wolfpits
against
the
sky
the
rosy
hue
faded
from
the
mountains
the
sky
cleared
to
a
thin
dazzling
blue
a
thread
of
smoke
issued
from
old
drew
s
chimney
rising
straight
as
a
larch
into
the
clear
air
in
the
room
beneath
him
where
george
and
mary
slept
he
heard
voices
no
doubt
george
malpas
was
telling
his
wife
what
had
happened
sometimes
the
talk
was
rapid
sometimes
there
were
long
silences
abner
was
thankful
that
the
sad
business
of
telling
mary
had
not
been
left
to
him
he
heard
the
children
s
voices
on
the
stair
the
time
had
come
when
he
would
have
to
face
them
all
they
were
all
in
the
kitchen
when
he
came
downstairs
he
could
see
from
mary
s
eyes
that
she
had
been
crying
she
scarcely
dared
to
look
at
him
lest
she
should
cry
again
george
was
pretending
to
be
cheerful
he
was
playing
with
the
children
telling
them
how
they
must
make
a
snow
man
in
the
drive
he
said
to
abner
as
though
nothing
had
happened
overnight
and
abner
s
heart
went
out
to
him
for
his
courage
mary
did
not
speak
to
him
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
red
eyes
were
reproachful
he
felt
that
she
probably
considered
him
responsible
for
the
tragedy
was
conscious
of
his
indirect
share
of
guilt
and
wished
there
were
some
way
in
which
he
could
atone
for
it
he
admired
the
manly
way
in
which
george
took
his
trouble
indeed
he
never
felt
so
wholly
friendly
to
george
in
his
life
the
elders
breakfasted
in
silence
but
the
children
talked
incessantly
being
excited
by
the
snow
an
overwhelming
impulse
to
put
himself
right
with
mary
made
abner
stop
her
when
she
was
carrying
the
breakfast
things
into
the
scullery
george
has
told
you
he
said
yes
he
s
told
me
i
suppose
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
naught
that
i
know
on
he
replied
and
she
left
him
quickly
for
she
did
not
want
him
to
see
her
crying
again
george
lit
his
pipe
at
the
fire
funny
to
hear
them
kids
he
said
with
a
half
smile
i
mind
it
just
the
same
once
before
it
was
at
mary
s
father
s
funeral
when
his
sister
her
aunt
rachel
brought
her
youngsters
over
from
they
were
spared
more
of
these
harrowing
contrasts
for
the
air
was
warm
and
the
children
carefully
wrapped
up
by
mary
ran
out
to
play
in
the
glistening
stuff
mary
did
not
reappear
and
the
two
men
sat
on
over
the
fire
only
george
spoke
from
time
to
time
it
s
all
of
a
piece
with
my
luck
he
said
i
reckon
i
was
born
unlucky
one
thing
and
another
i
don
t
mind
as
long
as
it
don
t
come
out
what
i
was
after
in
lesswardine
she
s
a
decent
woman
and
i
wouldn
t
have
her
damaged
by
it
i
wish
to
god
i
d
stayed
like
she
wanted
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
abner
to
speak
so
that
he
felt
bound
to
ask
who
the
woman
in
lesswardine
was
a
young
woman
a
widow
said
george
i
wouldn
t
have
her
name
mentioned
if
i
could
help
it
she
s
got
enough
to
put
up
with
probably
i
shan
t
see
her
so
i
ll
give
you
a
note
for
he
relapsed
into
silence
the
odds
is
he
went
on
after
a
long
pause
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
see
wolfpits
at
night
well
i
m
not
sorry
for
that
though
there
s
no
denying
that
mary
s
been
a
good
wife
to
he
spoke
more
excitedly
there
s
one
thing
try
as
they
will
they
can
t
make
it
murder
accidental
manslaughter
that
s
the
most
they
can
make
of
it
that
means
a
couple
of
years
hard
labour
you
can
t
tell
it
depends
on
the
damned
jury
only
mention
the
word
poaching
and
the
judges
are
again
you
yes
you
can
t
deny
she
s
been
a
good
wife
if
i
hadn
t
married
her
too
young
i
ve
got
mother
to
thank
for
that
but
i
don
t
know
what
ll
happen
to
her
she
s
too
proud
for
charity
and
she
d
starve
herself
and
the
children
rather
than
take
a
penny
piece
from
she
won
t
want
while
i
m
here
said
abner
george
looked
at
him
steadily
without
replying
you
mean
you
ll
stay
here
and
keep
the
home
together
if
you
want
me
to
said
abner
you
re
a
good
pal
abner
he
replied
i
ve
said
that
before
and
i
wouldn
t
have
her
suffer
there
s
something
in
what
her
dad
used
to
say
about
good
blood
and
that
if
i
hadn
t
took
a
fancy
against
her
this
wouldn
t
never
have
happened
i
wouldn
t
have
the
home
broke
i
ll
look
to
that
said
abner
that
is
if
she
don
t
turn
against
george
s
handsome
face
was
working
against
his
will
he
grasped
abner
s
hand
in
his
it
seemed
a
natural
gesture
you
re
a
proper
pal
he
said
and
then
in
a
debauch
of
by
god
you
re
the
only
pal
i
ve
got
that
i
can
trust
morgan
came
running
into
the
room
ahead
of
gladys
anxious
to
be
the
bearer
of
exciting
news
he
ran
straight
to
his
father
well
son
said
george
dad
dad
there
s
a
pleeceman
comin
up
the
drive
with
a
bicycle
he
cried
a
strange
one
we
don
t
know
gladys
added
go
into
the
back
to
your
mother
said
george
the
constable
from
lesswardine
knocked
at
the
door
and
handed
two
summonses
to
george
and
abner
inquest
at
the
pound
house
at
two
o
clock
you
understand
it
s
have
a
drink
of
beer
before
you
go
said
george
i
don
t
mind
said
the
constable
becoming
less
official
george
went
down
into
the
cellar
with
a
jug
this
is
a
bad
job
said
the
constable
a
bad
job
sure
abner
asked
him
which
way
he
thought
it
would
go
there
s
no
saying
he
replied
as
long
as
they
don
t
bring
it
in
he
was
a
fair
young
man
newly
recruited
to
the
force
from
some
herefordshire
village
the
ride
in
the
snow
had
freshened
his
complexion
and
made
him
look
healthy
and
jolly
there
s
a
nasty
drift
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
by
the
bridge
he
said
a
good
six
foot
of
it
well
here
s
luck
he
said
as
he
drank
off
george
s
beer
luck
s
the
word
said
george
and
god
knows
i
need
some
mary
came
into
the
room
with
a
set
face
warrants
for
the
inquest
said
george
oh
is
that
all
she
answered
with
relief
they
set
off
early
for
the
pound
house
fearing
that
the
driven
snow
might
delay
them
george
was
almost
gay
and
abner
wondered
at
his
friend
s
courage
they
avoided
chapel
green
being
anxious
not
to
pass
the
buffalo
in
mainstone
a
few
women
came
to
their
doors
and
stared
at
them
the
pound
house
door
was
open
a
number
of
jurors
had
already
arrived
they
were
mostly
farmers
or
shopkeepers
from
lesswardine
and
had
agreed
that
the
day
was
a
fine
one
in
spite
of
the
snow
and
that
it
was
lucky
that
the
tragedy
had
happened
at
a
time
when
they
were
not
busy
on
their
farms
susie
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
mr
hind
worried
and
paler
than
usual
was
doing
an
excellent
trade
in
hot
whisky
and
water
he
was
sorry
he
told
them
that
there
was
no
lemon
in
the
house
indeed
he
was
feverishly
anxious
to
put
himself
on
good
terms
with
the
jurors
when
george
and
abner
entered
an
awkward
silence
fell
upon
the
company
several
of
those
who
knew
malpas
said
to
him
the
fact
that
he
was
greeted
by
these
men
who
were
shortly
to
sit
in
judgment
on
him
encouraged
him
he
took
a
seat
on
one
of
the
benches
in
the
corner
of
the
room
abner
went
to
the
bar
and
asked
for
a
drink
mr
hind
with
hatred
shining
in
his
pale
eyes
served
him
hope
you
re
all
right
mr
hind
said
abner
friendlily
the
landlord
trembled
with
rage
he
pushed
abner
s
glass
at
him
spilling
a
quarter
of
the
whisky
i
hope
i
ve
seen
the
last
of
you
he
said
the
jurymen
now
congregated
in
the
other
corner
of
the
room
as
though
they
realised
that
it
was
not
fitting
that
they
should
mix
with
such
important
figures
in
the
affair
as
george
and
his
friend
they
talked
together
in
low
voices
abner
and
george
sat
quietly
listening
but
only
instinctive
glances
in
their
direction
told
them
when
george
s
name
was
mentioned
at
the
end
of
the
bar
was
another
door
leading
into
the
generally
used
for
the
meetings
of
friendly
societies
in
which
the
inquest
would
be
held
abner
wondered
if
the
body
of
bastard
lay
inside
it
for
heavy
steps
were
heard
from
time
to
time
through
the
closed
door
at
last
the
door
was
opened
and
the
sergeant
of
police
from
lesswardine
appeared
in
it
he
stood
there
very
erect
and
official
bending
stiffly
to
recognise
the
more
important
of
the
group
of
jurymen
then
his
eyes
fell
on
george
and
abner
he
beckoned
to
them
and
called
them
into
the
second
room
abner
had
expected
that
bastard
s
bony
carcass
would
be
revealed
lying
in
state
but
instead
of
this
he
saw
a
long
deal
table
with
an
at
the
head
of
it
and
six
other
ordinary
chairs
on
either
side
in
front
of
the
coroner
s
seat
were
spread
a
pile
of
official
papers
ink
and
a
selection
of
equally
impossible
pens
on
the
wall
above
it
hung
a
trophy
the
horns
of
a
north
american
bison
with
a
boss
of
black
hair
between
them
which
in
a
more
savage
age
might
well
have
symbolised
the
official
s
power
of
life
and
death
but
in
fact
represented
those
that
were
vested
in
the
master
of
the
local
branch
of
the
ancient
order
of
buffaloes
the
sergeant
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
already
past
two
o
clock
he
went
out
to
look
down
the
road
to
see
if
the
coroner
was
in
sight
the
young
constable
who
had
delivered
the
warrants
earlier
in
the
day
was
busy
placing
a
copy
of
the
new
testament
in
front
of
each
of
the
jurymen
s
seats
when
the
sergeant
s
back
was
turned
he
winked
at
george
and
abner
then
he
closed
the
door
and
left
them
alone
they
ve
summonsed
fourteen
for
the
jury
said
george
i
ve
counted
em
there
s
three
good
friends
to
me
mr
prosser
of
the
dyke
jones
of
pensilva
and
watkins
the
tailor
the
one
i
m
frightened
of
is
the
big
chap
with
the
red
face
williams
his
name
is
he
fell
out
with
mother
over
a
hogshead
of
cider
five
years
ago
and
haven
t
spoken
to
me
nor
her
since
he
d
be
glad
enough
to
see
me
swing
well
what
s
coming
s
bound
to
come
tis
no
good
thinking
on
he
said
no
more
but
began
to
beat
out
the
rhythm
of
a
song
on
the
floor
with
the
end
of
his
stick
staring
straight
in
front
of
him
at
the
bison
s
head
abner
wished
that
something
would
happen
he
hated
this
mechanical
tapping
a
loud
voice
was
heard
in
the
bar
and
with
it
the
scraping
of
feet
the
coroner
had
arrived
the
sergeant
threw
open
the
doors
with
a
flourish
and
mr
mortimer
entered
he
was
a
big
man
with
a
handsome
rather
heavy
face
bushy
white
eyebrows
over
pale
blue
eyes
and
a
pointed
beard
in
which
a
yellow
like
that
of
tobacco
stains
was
mingled
with
white
he
walked
quickly
to
the
head
of
the
table
his
flapping
behind
under
his
arm
he
carried
a
sheaf
of
papers
that
he
spread
out
flat
in
front
of
him
then
he
patted
the
table
on
either
side
of
them
with
his
hands
and
took
up
a
pen
the
sergeant
stood
stiffly
at
his
elbow
and
the
jury
shuffled
into
their
places
mr
williams
as
by
common
consent
planted
himself
at
the
coroner
s
right
hand
i
declare
this
court
open
in
the
king
s
name
said
mr
mortimer
in
a
deep
impressive
voice
the
sergeant
stood
as
though
hypnotised
by
the
formula
the
coroner
turned
on
him
suddenly
now
sergeant
he
boomed
look
alive
we
don
t
want
to
stay
here
all
day
get
the
jury
sworn
he
dived
once
more
into
his
papers
yawned
rubbed
his
hands
glanced
behind
him
at
the
symbolical
buffalo
and
then
suddenly
decided
to
clean
his
nails
with
a
meanwhile
with
testaments
lifted
in
their
right
hands
the
jurymen
one
by
one
in
different
inflections
of
the
border
tongue
repeated
the
oath
which
the
sergeant
administered
to
them
swear
by
almighty
i
swear
by
almighty
i
will
well
and
duly
that
i
will
well
and
duly
it
was
like
the
chorus
that
one
may
hear
any
morning
of
the
week
outside
the
windows
of
a
country
from
time
to
time
the
coroner
looked
up
impatiently
from
his
manicure
and
the
sergeant
increased
his
pace
finished
said
mr
mortimer
at
last
yes
sir
all
correct
said
the
sergeant
now
gentlemen
you
must
choose
a
foreman
only
be
quick
about
it
we
re
in
point
of
fact
the
jury
had
been
waiting
for
him
for
more
than
an
hour
but
the
question
of
choosing
a
foreman
did
not
detain
them
for
long
since
mrs
malpas
s
enemy
williams
of
the
pentre
had
already
virtually
chosen
himself
very
good
very
good
said
the
coroner
take
them
to
view
the
body
they
filed
out
behind
the
policeman
opening
their
ranks
at
the
door
to
admit
the
doctor
from
lesswardine
who
apologised
for
his
lateness
and
shook
hands
with
the
coroner
you
ve
done
the
said
the
latter
yes
that
s
what
kept
and
found
what
you
expected
yes
fractured
base
i
had
no
doubt
about
cheap
worth
you
d
better
take
your
money
now
to
save
time
sign
for
it
the
doctor
pocketed
the
sovereigns
and
placed
the
florin
aside
according
to
the
unwritten
law
that
obtains
in
such
cases
for
the
sergeant
sad
affair
said
the
coroner
with
a
yawn
good
man
bastard
one
of
the
old
sort
conscientious
no
brains
ideal
policeman
what
the
devil
are
those
fellers
doing
i
ve
promised
to
call
for
tea
at
the
i
was
hoping
said
the
doctor
that
you
d
come
back
with
me
my
wife
no
thanks
very
kind
of
you
all
the
we
don
t
often
see
you
this
no
not
since
condover
s
suicide
i
believe
his
s
mixed
up
in
this
affair
yes
he
s
over
there
in
the
corner
it
s
the
usual
thing
i
think
a
brawl
in
an
alehouse
the
coroner
nodded
his
head
dolefully
his
cellar
was
the
best
in
ludlow
the
jurors
returned
and
with
a
final
glance
at
the
buffalo
s
head
as
though
he
expected
it
to
tell
him
the
time
mr
mortimer
began
business
first
the
sergeant
identified
the
body
of
his
subordinate
standing
rigidly
at
attention
he
rattled
off
the
oath
at
a
terrific
speed
running
his
evidence
on
to
the
end
of
it
without
a
stop
he
could
soon
show
the
coroner
how
to
do
it
mr
mortimer
never
raised
his
eyes
from
his
papers
i
may
say
sir
began
the
sergeant
impressively
you
may
say
what
you
like
sergeant
when
you
re
asked
for
it
snapped
the
coroner
that
s
the
sergeant
stepped
back
full
of
offended
dignity
the
jury
were
impressed
mr
mortimer
was
behaving
in
accordance
with
his
reputation
other
evidence
followed
rapidly
george
and
abner
leaned
forward
listening
george
with
his
head
in
his
hands
and
his
eyes
staring
out
under
the
arch
of
his
fingers
the
second
finger
of
his
right
hand
still
beat
out
the
rhythm
of
the
song
that
was
running
in
the
back
of
his
mind
dr
hendrie
i
swear
by
almighty
god
that
the
evidence
i
shall
give
to
this
court
shall
be
the
whole
nothing
but
the
arthur
cuthbert
hendrie
and
i
am
a
physician
and
surgeon
practising
in
lesswardine
i
had
seen
deceased
but
did
not
know
him
yesterday
evening
before
ten
o
clock
i
was
called
to
the
pound
house
i
arrived
there
between
ten
and
eleven
nearer
eleven
and
found
deceased
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
bar
with
blood
and
serum
flowing
from
ears
and
nose
both
ears
he
was
quite
quite
dead
can
you
say
how
long
he
had
been
dead
very
well
go
i
immediately
formed
the
opinion
they
told
me
that
he
had
had
a
violent
fall
that
death
was
due
to
a
fractured
base
of
the
skull
there
was
a
bruise
over
the
left
temporal
you
performed
a
yes
this
morning
i
found
the
fracture
that
i
had
suspected
in
the
middle
will
your
honour
ask
n
what
that
there
means
the
witness
means
the
middle
part
of
the
base
of
the
skull
fossa
the
coroner
explained
loftily
death
no
doubt
was
instantaneous
the
condition
was
consistent
with
the
story
of
a
violent
fall
on
a
stone
floor
the
same
condition
might
have
been
caused
by
a
blunt
instrument
deceased
was
old
for
his
years
as
shown
by
the
atheromatous
condition
of
the
cerebral
very
good
have
you
any
questions
to
ask
the
witness
the
jury
all
shook
their
heads
if
you
are
in
a
hurry
dr
hendrie
i
think
we
can
spare
thank
you
sir
good
daniel
prosser
hind
daniel
prosser
hind
was
a
licensed
victualler
and
the
lessee
of
the
pound
house
the
owners
were
messrs
astill
of
north
bromwich
he
knew
the
deceased
couldn
t
say
that
they
were
friends
as
deceased
had
only
lately
come
to
mainstone
he
remembered
last
night
the
bar
was
middling
full
he
himself
was
in
the
parlour
working
over
accounts
his
daughter
being
in
charge
of
the
bar
about
he
heard
a
row
and
ran
into
the
bar
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
mr
badger
on
the
floor
and
young
fellows
on
the
top
of
him
behind
them
he
saw
bastard
lying
on
his
back
with
blood
coming
from
his
ears
and
nose
some
one
said
bastard
was
stunned
he
felt
bastard
s
heart
and
said
no
he
s
he
did
not
see
deceased
fall
he
was
told
he
quite
understood
and
begged
his
worship
s
pardon
if
he
might
say
so
nothing
of
this
kind
had
ever
occurred
in
a
house
under
his
management
before
what
with
the
cloggers
and
the
navvies
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
keep
an
orderly
house
he
wished
to
express
regret
for
what
had
happened
he
could
not
say
if
badger
and
fellows
had
been
drinking
mr
badger
was
usually
a
temperate
man
a
man
named
connor
had
the
appearance
of
being
the
worse
for
liquor
were
you
not
aware
of
this
before
no
as
he
had
explained
he
was
busy
with
the
october
accounts
you
consider
your
daughter
a
fit
person
to
be
in
charge
of
a
crowded
bar
yes
his
daughter
was
quite
competent
and
used
to
keeping
order
how
old
is
she
she
was
twenty
years
of
age
messrs
astill
he
persisted
always
expected
the
accounts
to
be
ready
by
the
end
of
the
month
and
he
had
happened
to
be
a
little
behind
with
them
messrs
astill
would
speak
for
him
you
consider
that
you
performed
your
duty
as
licensee
of
this
inn
yes
certainly
he
considered
he
had
done
his
duty
he
had
sent
for
the
doctor
at
once
you
really
expect
me
and
the
jury
to
believe
that
a
girl
of
twenty
is
a
fit
person
to
be
left
in
charge
of
a
bar
full
of
those
rough
men
very
well
you
can
stand
susan
hind
twenty
said
she
was
daughter
of
the
previous
witness
she
did
not
know
deceased
though
he
was
in
the
habit
of
looking
in
of
nights
she
had
never
served
him
in
the
bar
on
the
night
in
question
there
was
nothing
unusual
there
were
near
about
twenty
men
in
the
bar
mr
badger
was
sitting
alone
over
in
the
corner
he
was
not
drunk
fellows
was
not
drunk
she
didn
t
think
that
connor
was
drunk
she
ought
to
know
when
a
fellow
was
drunk
there
was
no
special
rule
as
to
when
they
should
be
served
or
not
yes
that
was
it
she
used
her
discretion
certainly
connor
was
excitable
he
had
had
two
or
three
quarts
no
that
was
nothing
for
connor
he
was
always
quick
with
his
tongue
and
the
others
were
laughing
at
him
she
agreed
with
her
father
that
she
could
manage
men
if
any
one
could
she
had
been
used
to
it
for
years
ever
since
she
was
sixteen
she
hadn
t
noticed
anything
until
badger
dropped
his
glass
on
the
floor
and
came
over
to
connor
she
supposed
connor
had
riled
him
but
she
hadn
t
been
listening
connor
always
went
on
at
people
she
saw
badger
give
fellows
a
hit
in
the
face
and
then
the
two
of
them
went
down
she
called
her
father
and
while
her
back
was
turned
bastard
must
have
come
in
she
saw
him
try
to
pull
fellows
off
badger
she
saw
malpas
take
bastard
by
the
arm
he
didn
t
use
no
violence
that
she
saw
bastard
tried
to
fix
malpas
s
arms
she
saw
the
two
of
them
swaying
about
together
they
must
have
tripped
over
something
they
went
down
so
sudden
bastard
did
not
cry
out
she
remembered
nothing
more
she
was
that
scared
malpas
had
not
been
drinking
he
had
had
one
drink
a
small
whisky
of
course
she
couldn
t
say
if
he
had
got
drink
anywhere
else
in
her
opinion
he
was
sober
the
only
man
in
the
room
that
was
drunk
was
atwell
she
had
gone
on
serving
him
because
she
knew
by
experience
that
he
could
behave
decent
with
it
he
was
like
that
most
nights
atwell
who
had
smiled
at
this
tribute
to
his
powers
was
called
next
he
didn
t
remember
nothing
he
couldn
t
say
if
he
was
drunk
because
he
didn
t
remember
asked
if
he
wasn
t
ashamed
of
himself
he
had
nothing
to
say
michael
connor
corroborated
the
evidence
of
the
witness
susan
hind
anything
he
had
said
to
badger
was
not
out
of
the
way
he
was
only
letting
on
he
admitted
having
a
drop
taken
he
was
nourished
not
drunk
atwell
was
drunk
more
luck
to
him
that
was
making
the
court
no
impertinent
answer
he
said
it
by
the
way
of
no
harm
abner
fellows
he
had
been
sitting
half
hypnotised
by
the
progress
of
the
evidence
each
of
the
witnesses
had
seemed
to
him
strange
and
unfamiliar
this
subdued
susan
was
not
the
girl
who
came
passionately
to
his
arms
mr
hind
was
pale
shabby
shrunken
even
mick
was
not
the
radiant
companion
that
he
knew
he
heard
his
own
name
in
a
dream
george
malpas
pushed
him
forward
as
the
sergeant
took
an
officious
step
in
his
direction
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
long
table
staring
at
the
top
of
the
coroner
s
head
and
the
buffalo
horns
above
it
the
foreman
of
the
jury
was
examining
him
closely
much
as
on
market
days
he
would
have
examined
a
likely
bullock
the
man
with
the
white
beard
went
on
writing
in
a
large
fluent
hand
while
the
sergeant
thrust
the
testament
into
abner
s
fingers
and
dictated
the
oath
to
him
he
had
to
clear
his
throat
for
his
voice
had
left
him
the
coroner
blotted
his
notes
methodically
and
looked
up
yes
abner
fellows
age
occupation
tell
me
all
you
know
of
what
happened
last
night
not
too
fast
i
have
to
write
it
slowly
abner
told
his
own
story
very
good
you
say
that
badger
hit
you
in
the
face
are
you
on
bad
terms
with
badger
i
never
spoke
to
him
when
he
struck
you
you
lost
your
temper
any
one
you
say
malpas
is
a
friend
of
yours
i
lodge
with
and
malpas
was
not
drunk
not
that
i
could
do
you
know
where
malpas
had
been
that
evening
abner
hesitated
he
felt
that
george
s
eyes
were
on
him
from
behind
very
abner
went
back
to
his
seat
he
saw
mr
hind
rubbing
his
hands
together
nervously
saw
the
white
face
of
susie
he
flopped
down
heavily
into
the
seat
beside
george
malpas
never
stirred
he
still
sat
with
his
hands
to
his
head
drumming
with
his
finger
on
his
temple
william
badger
william
badger
gamekeeper
in
the
employment
of
sir
george
delahay
said
he
had
been
to
the
pound
house
on
business
his
business
was
to
try
and
pick
up
information
about
poaching
on
his
master
s
land
nothing
was
safe
in
lesswardine
since
the
navvies
had
been
working
there
he
was
watching
three
men
name
connor
fellows
and
atwell
he
believed
connor
was
the
ringleader
he
had
not
come
there
to
watch
malpas
constable
bastard
knew
that
he
was
there
on
that
business
he
had
told
bastard
that
he
thought
he
had
recognised
connor
in
an
affray
three
nights
before
he
had
sat
in
the
corner
quietly
listening
connor
had
been
talking
at
him
all
evening
and
at
last
he
had
lost
his
temper
he
was
a
man
and
couldn
t
abide
poachers
he
had
meant
to
shut
connor
s
mouth
he
couldn
t
say
if
he
had
meant
to
hit
him
when
he
came
up
to
connor
he
saw
fellows
looking
ugly
they
were
all
the
same
gang
he
didn
t
remember
hitting
fellows
in
the
face
but
if
he
hadn
t
done
so
fellows
would
have
hit
him
the
next
moment
fellows
was
on
the
top
of
him
he
didn
t
see
bastard
come
in
bastard
was
a
friend
of
his
he
did
not
see
malpas
and
bastard
fighting
he
could
not
have
seen
bastard
fall
as
fellows
was
on
the
top
of
him
in
his
opinion
bastard
had
died
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
bastard
had
been
a
great
help
to
him
george
malpas
george
walked
straight
to
the
foot
of
the
table
haggard
tall
handsome
as
ever
while
he
gave
his
evidence
he
still
drummed
with
his
fingers
on
the
board
the
tone
of
mr
mortimer
s
voice
sharpened
as
he
questioned
him
but
george
s
account
of
the
affair
agreed
in
every
detail
with
that
of
the
other
witnesses
you
do
not
suggest
that
you
attacked
bastard
when
under
the
influence
of
drink
no
i
had
not
been
where
had
you
spent
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
at
in
a
no
with
a
were
you
and
bastard
on
good
terms
i
had
never
spoken
to
him
before
in
my
then
why
did
you
suddenly
attack
him
i
never
attacked
him
badger
had
hit
out
at
fellows
and
fellows
had
a
right
to
get
his
own
back
i
wanted
to
see
fair
play
i
put
my
hand
on
bastard
s
that
s
all
very
well
you
know
it
is
a
serious
offence
to
interfere
with
a
constable
in
the
discharge
of
his
fellows
was
my
pal
i
never
did
nothing
to
bastard
when
i
touched
his
arm
he
turned
on
me
he
was
trying
to
take
me
in
charge
we
must
have
tripped
on
something
we
fell
down
together
i
had
nothing
against
very
well
you
may
sit
the
sergeant
cleared
his
throat
if
i
may
say
a
few
words
sir
the
coroner
finished
his
notes
then
sat
back
to
listen
i
may
say
sir
that
we
have
been
dissatisfied
for
some
time
with
the
conduct
of
this
house
neither
mr
hind
nor
his
daughter
bear
a
good
character
with
us
and
bastard
has
had
occasion
to
speak
to
me
about
the
here
from
time
to
time
he
has
also
said
that
mr
badger
was
a
great
help
to
him
connor
atwell
and
fellows
all
have
the
name
of
rough
characters
we
have
only
been
waiting
for
the
necessary
evidence
that
will
do
very
good
sir
on
inquiries
in
lesswardine
i
find
that
malpas
spent
the
evening
in
the
house
of
a
young
widow
woman
named
george
rose
to
his
feet
and
took
a
step
forward
sit
down
shouted
the
coroner
named
that
will
do
as
you
wish
mr
mortimer
adjusted
his
glasses
and
sat
for
a
moment
in
silence
turning
over
his
paper
now
gentlemen
he
said
at
last
you
have
heard
this
er
very
distressing
evidence
in
this
type
of
i
am
glad
to
say
they
are
rare
in
the
is
usual
to
find
a
great
conflict
of
evidence
here
the
ah
testimony
is
unusually
clear
in
the
first
place
you
have
a
a
which
i
am
bound
to
say
appears
to
me
to
have
been
managed
with
a
considerable
degree
of
laxness
in
this
part
of
the
country
we
ah
suffer
from
the
presence
of
a
floating
population
gipsies
cloggers
and
at
the
present
moment
the
men
engaged
on
the
north
bromwich
waterworks
these
men
have
to
spend
their
evenings
somewhere
and
it
appears
that
the
pound
house
ah
found
favour
with
them
they
were
in
the
habit
of
drinking
here
every
night
sometimes
under
the
supervision
of
a
girl
of
twenty
the
sergeant
has
said
that
he
considers
this
young
woman
ah
advanced
for
her
years
that
may
well
be
but
none
the
less
i
think
hind
has
been
lacking
in
responsibility
very
good
among
the
men
who
frequent
this
house
are
three
notorious
poachers
connor
atwell
and
fellows
poaching
is
another
of
the
pests
that
this
floating
population
brings
in
its
train
badger
the
keeper
who
gave
his
evidence
very
clearly
and
straightforwardly
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
pound
house
to
keep
an
eye
on
this
ah
disorderly
trio
as
he
had
a
right
to
do
he
enlisted
the
help
of
the
deceased
the
affair
began
in
the
usual
way
of
a
brawl
what
connor
said
to
badger
whether
badger
assaulted
fellows
these
are
matters
that
do
not
concern
you
only
in
passing
i
say
that
the
whole
business
could
not
have
occurred
in
a
properly
managed
house
there
was
a
struggle
the
deceased
constable
in
the
plain
performance
of
his
duty
entered
the
bar
and
ah
commenced
to
separate
badger
and
fellows
if
his
desire
was
to
protect
badger
well
and
good
but
even
that
is
immaterial
now
comes
the
important
part
malpas
says
that
he
ah
says
that
he
put
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
the
deceased
and
that
thereupon
bastard
turned
on
him
and
tried
to
take
him
in
charge
he
then
by
his
own
admission
resisted
arrest
he
and
bastard
struggled
together
and
fell
in
each
other
s
arms
the
medical
evidence
tells
us
that
bastard
died
from
a
fractured
base
of
the
skull
the
result
of
this
fall
you
may
ask
yourselves
the
question
was
bastard
within
his
rights
in
arresting
or
trying
to
arrest
malpas
you
need
not
find
an
answer
to
it
legally
the
answer
is
yes
but
all
that
is
expected
of
you
is
to
determine
how
the
deceased
met
his
death
he
met
his
death
in
a
struggle
with
malpas
malpas
by
his
own
admission
first
laid
hands
on
him
thus
obstructing
an
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
next
again
by
his
own
admission
he
resisted
arrest
as
a
result
of
this
resistance
bastard
fell
as
a
result
of
the
fall
he
fractured
his
skull
and
died
ah
instantaneously
you
may
trace
if
you
like
the
responsibility
for
his
death
backward
through
connor
badger
and
fellows
to
hind
but
the
immediate
cause
of
it
was
the
coroner
took
off
his
glasses
and
pushed
his
notes
aside
he
spoke
slowly
waving
the
to
mark
his
points
very
well
now
it
is
your
duty
to
determine
the
degree
of
malpas
s
responsibility
did
malpas
intend
to
kill
the
deceased
the
sergeant
of
the
police
has
tried
very
improperly
to
make
a
statement
as
to
malpas
s
general
the
sergeant
shuffled
his
feet
and
swallowed
but
succumbed
to
a
sense
of
discipline
and
was
silent
i
am
bound
to
say
that
there
is
no
evidence
pointing
to
malpas
having
killed
bastard
of
malice
aforethought
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
lied
when
he
told
you
that
he
had
never
spoken
to
bastard
before
did
he
then
desire
to
attack
bastard
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
with
intent
to
kill
he
has
told
you
that
he
wanted
to
see
fair
play
between
fellows
whom
he
describes
as
his
pal
and
badger
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
him
another
question
presents
itself
did
he
become
murderous
under
the
influence
of
drink
this
is
negatived
by
all
the
evidence
now
you
must
be
careful
if
malpas
laid
hands
on
bastard
with
intent
to
kill
either
under
the
influence
of
an
old
grudge
or
in
a
sudden
fit
of
passion
whether
drunk
or
sober
he
is
guilty
of
murder
and
it
is
your
duty
to
say
so
if
on
the
other
hand
he
laid
hands
on
bastard
without
intending
to
offer
him
any
violence
and
if
in
the
course
of
a
struggle
in
which
he
was
resisting
arrest
he
caused
bastard
to
fall
and
thus
brought
about
bastard
s
end
his
crime
lies
on
the
borderland
between
murder
and
homicide
ah
manslaughter
if
malpas
had
no
part
in
the
death
of
the
deceased
you
may
say
that
the
constable
died
by
misadventure
i
think
this
is
a
case
in
which
you
may
be
left
to
decide
for
yourselves
nothing
that
you
know
of
malpas
s
private
life
and
i
presume
that
you
all
know
something
of
it
must
influence
your
verdict
the
death
of
a
policeman
a
man
whom
the
law
provides
for
your
protection
and
the
protection
of
your
property
is
a
very
serious
matter
if
policemen
are
to
be
obstructed
in
their
duty
with
impunity
the
whole
fabric
of
life
in
these
remote
districts
becomes
ah
insecure
you
may
now
consider
your
verdict
you
had
better
mr
mortimer
put
on
his
glasses
the
jury
led
by
williams
shuffled
out
like
a
group
of
sidesmen
collecting
in
church
the
sergeant
bent
over
the
coroner
whispered
and
handed
him
a
paper
which
he
put
aside
you
re
in
too
great
a
hurry
sergeant
he
said
the
witnesses
sat
motionless
in
the
back
of
the
court
susie
as
before
staring
straight
in
front
of
her
as
pale
and
tragic
as
a
young
widow
mr
hind
with
his
hands
clasped
in
front
of
him
bunched
up
like
a
sack
and
his
pouched
eyes
paler
than
ever
waiting
for
a
rider
to
the
verdict
badger
obstinate
with
his
head
thrust
forward
mick
and
atwell
stolidly
masticating
tobacco
abner
saw
them
all
petrified
by
the
gloom
of
suspense
george
s
finger
had
ceased
from
its
mechanical
tattoo
all
through
the
coroner
s
summing
up
he
had
listened
intensely
once
or
twice
his
lips
had
moved
and
his
muscles
stiffened
as
though
he
wanted
to
say
something
now
he
sat
quite
still
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
staring
as
it
seemed
at
the
buffalo
s
head
one
after
another
the
witnesses
were
called
up
to
sign
their
evidence
the
coroner
looked
at
his
watch
and
sighed
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
not
have
time
to
take
tea
with
the
delahays
and
this
annoyed
him
for
lady
delahay
was
a
very
attractive
woman
and
a
visit
to
lesswardine
court
always
left
him
with
a
pleasant
afterglow
and
made
him
feel
that
but
for
his
wife
he
might
have
become
an
ornament
of
county
society
the
sergeant
stood
like
a
waxen
policeman
in
madame
tussaud
s
by
a
combination
of
frowns
winks
and
rollings
of
the
eyes
he
indicated
to
his
bewildered
subordinate
that
the
testaments
on
the
table
might
now
be
collected
the
young
constable
stumped
round
the
table
on
noisy
tiptoes
no
other
sound
was
heard
but
the
settling
of
thawed
snow
on
the
roof
the
tinkle
of
a
distant
anvil
and
the
noise
of
a
blob
of
nicotined
saliva
which
atwell
privily
dropped
upon
the
floor
and
then
obliterated
with
a
sideways
motion
of
his
foot
the
jury
and
took
their
seats
at
the
table
the
sergeant
insensibly
stiffened
mr
williams
held
a
paper
in
his
hand
well
said
the
coroner
you
have
arrived
at
your
verdict
yes
your
honour
unanimous
we
find
wait
a
moment
yes
very
good
go
we
find
unanimous
that
the
deceased
died
in
accordance
with
the
doctor
s
evidence
and
that
his
death
was
caused
unintentionally
by
george
that
is
yes
your
honour
unintentional
you
can
t
qualify
it
manslaughter
you
have
added
no
rider
no
your
well
i
am
bound
to
say
i
endorse
your
verdict
i
think
that
you
might
profitably
have
expressed
your
opinion
on
the
management
of
this
he
called
daniel
hind
mr
hind
rose
with
a
gasp
you
have
heard
what
i
think
of
the
management
of
your
house
and
i
hope
that
the
licensing
justices
will
ah
endorse
it
another
time
when
an
inquest
is
held
in
this
room
in
winter
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
put
a
fire
in
it
george
malpas
george
staggered
to
the
end
of
the
table
you
have
heard
the
jury
s
verdict
you
will
be
committed
on
my
warrant
to
take
your
trial
on
a
charge
of
manslaughter
you
are
lucky
that
the
charge
is
not
ah
the
sergeant
who
had
been
waiting
for
this
again
presented
his
paper
to
the
coroner
and
mr
mortimer
having
wiped
the
nib
of
his
pen
signed
it
in
his
bold
deliberate
handwriting
he
signed
it
carefully
and
looked
at
his
signature
afterward
it
was
not
often
that
he
tasted
so
singular
a
sensation
of
power
the
sergeant
blotted
the
document
and
advanced
toward
george
malpas
he
came
like
a
dignified
spider
toward
a
fly
safely
entangled
in
its
web
better
go
and
tell
them
george
said
to
abner
tell
mother
first
tell
em
i
m
all
the
fifteenth
chapter
abner
did
not
wait
for
george
to
be
arrested
to
the
evident
scandal
of
the
sergeant
he
made
straight
for
the
door
and
slipped
into
the
bar
he
closed
the
door
quietly
and
stopped
for
a
moment
there
was
something
in
the
feeling
of
the
room
that
told
him
he
had
broken
in
on
a
secret
no
doubt
the
continued
strain
with
which
he
had
heard
the
evidence
unfolded
had
tuned
his
nerves
to
a
supersensitive
pitch
he
wasn
t
usually
nervous
under
any
conditions
but
the
sudden
change
from
the
courtroom
to
this
cold
empty
chamber
unfamiliar
in
the
took
him
aback
unsteadied
him
at
the
moment
of
his
entrance
the
room
had
been
expectant
listening
now
when
he
paused
for
a
second
to
look
at
it
he
saw
nothing
unusual
only
the
long
shelves
with
their
black
bottles
of
dubious
port
and
sherry
the
receptacles
of
glass
in
which
spirits
were
kept
on
tap
the
polished
handles
of
the
the
only
unusual
thing
was
the
closed
door
of
the
room
behind
the
counter
in
which
bastard
s
body
now
lay
he
didn
t
try
to
find
an
explanation
for
the
peculiar
chill
that
this
room
gave
him
midway
between
the
dead
man
s
flesh
and
the
anguished
soul
of
the
man
who
had
killed
him
but
he
felt
it
and
when
he
turned
the
key
in
the
locked
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
street
he
felt
again
behind
him
the
sense
of
something
strange
stealing
back
into
the
bar
he
shivered
and
set
off
for
chapel
green
to
tell
mrs
malpas
all
sparkle
of
light
had
vanished
from
the
snow
the
sky
had
now
grown
colder
than
the
land
and
in
the
north
a
wind
was
rising
he
walked
fast
to
keep
the
heat
in
his
limbs
he
passed
the
last
cottages
of
mainstone
and
came
into
the
length
of
roman
road
which
he
and
george
had
so
often
travelled
at
night
the
wind
set
up
a
faint
and
mournful
singing
in
the
telegraph
wires
the
winter
night
descended
no
human
shape
was
to
be
seen
on
the
long
white
road
but
that
of
abner
and
another
smaller
figure
that
approached
him
rapidly
from
the
west
he
took
it
for
granted
that
this
was
a
little
girl
hurrying
home
to
mainstone
from
the
dissenting
school
at
chapel
green
but
when
they
met
in
the
dusk
and
stared
at
one
another
he
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
wayfarer
was
george
s
mother
all
the
time
since
he
left
the
inn
he
had
been
turning
over
in
his
mind
the
ways
in
which
he
might
best
reveal
his
tragic
news
now
that
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
mrs
malpas
small
intense
and
awful
in
her
sunday
bonnet
he
could
say
nothing
they
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
in
which
abner
was
conscious
of
the
hatred
in
her
black
eyes
evenin
ma
am
he
said
it
s
lucky
i
met
you
george
sent
me
along
with
a
tell
me
tell
me
quick
young
man
she
cried
don
t
keep
it
back
whatever
it
be
bad
news
ma
i
know
it
is
tell
me
they
ve
took
him
in
charge
it
s
she
made
a
shrill
wailing
noise
something
between
a
laugh
and
a
cry
she
gripped
his
arm
tight
he
knew
that
she
would
almost
rather
have
touched
any
one
on
earth
but
if
she
had
not
steadied
herself
she
would
have
fallen
manslaughter
oh
god
my
god
o
lord
have
mercy
on
him
poor
soul
and
on
us
too
to
think
it
should
come
to
that
oh
god
god
she
clutched
him
again
as
though
a
wave
were
sweeping
her
legs
from
under
her
her
bony
fingers
went
into
the
muscle
of
abner
s
arm
now
don
t
take
on
ma
am
he
said
manslaughter
s
a
different
thing
from
murder
thank
your
luck
for
that
don
t
talk
to
me
of
luck
she
cried
luck
s
a
heathen
word
as
a
man
sows
so
shall
he
reap
the
hand
of
the
lord
is
heavy
on
me
and
my
son
he
hath
forsaken
the
way
of
righteousness
drink
and
strange
women
and
all
the
abominations
of
the
ungodly
all
my
prayers
on
him
were
wasted
young
man
for
i
couldn
t
keep
his
feet
in
the
way
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
took
away
and
now
he
stands
before
an
earthly
judge
i
must
go
and
see
she
detached
herself
from
abner
s
arm
but
a
fit
of
trembling
took
her
and
made
her
cling
to
it
again
you
d
best
come
home
along
of
me
ma
am
he
said
they
ll
have
took
him
to
lesswardine
by
this
she
broke
down
into
harsh
sobs
crying
childishly
and
in
between
her
sobbing
he
could
hear
her
babble
the
same
curious
mixture
of
scriptural
and
unscriptural
lamentation
she
talked
so
wildly
that
he
thought
the
old
woman
was
going
off
her
head
when
she
sobbed
the
jet
ornaments
on
her
bonnet
danced
come
home
along
of
me
ma
am
he
repeated
helplessly
she
seemed
not
to
hear
him
george
my
little
george
she
sobbed
abasing
accusing
herself
before
the
harsh
personal
deity
that
she
imagined
wrestling
with
him
in
prayer
and
entreaty
oh
lord
forgive
him
forgive
him
forgive
him
then
quite
suddenly
she
stopped
no
sound
was
heard
but
that
of
her
faint
trembling
abner
thanked
goodness
that
she
had
tired
herself
out
but
he
was
mistaken
without
the
least
warning
her
weak
hands
pushed
him
away
she
stood
before
him
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
faced
him
with
her
ridiculous
bonnet
awry
and
her
fingers
clenched
like
the
claws
of
some
small
fierce
wild
animal
waiting
to
spring
at
a
man
s
throat
her
wrists
worked
with
passion
she
forgot
all
her
scripture
and
cursed
him
in
her
own
words
it
s
you
who
ve
led
him
astray
she
cried
you
you
didn
t
i
know
it
the
very
day
when
you
and
your
mate
came
to
our
house
you
the
scum
of
the
roads
that
s
fine
company
for
a
decent
man
you
can
t
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
i
begged
him
and
begged
him
not
to
have
the
likes
of
you
in
his
house
but
he
laughed
at
me
and
you
ve
dragged
him
down
down
as
low
as
a
man
can
be
dragged
you
with
your
drink
and
your
poaching
and
your
women
don
t
think
i
haven
t
heard
what
happened
the
two
of
you
coming
home
drunk
of
nights
singing
bawdy
songs
in
the
dark
that
wasn
t
enough
for
you
you
must
drag
him
into
your
drunken
fighting
drag
him
down
and
down
into
your
mucky
life
and
then
you
come
and
talk
to
me
of
luck
luck
he
s
been
led
astray
that
s
what
george
has
by
your
company
if
george
s
soul
is
damned
it
s
you
who
will
suffer
for
it
bringin
your
town
ways
into
a
country
place
you
and
his
precious
wife
the
two
of
you
between
you
what
s
in
the
blood
comes
out
in
the
life
her
father
were
a
thief
and
a
swindler
and
a
suicide
and
god
visits
the
sins
of
the
fathers
like
father
like
daughter
that
s
the
sort
of
bedfellow
my
george
has
had
and
this
is
what
she
s
brought
him
to
poor
lamb
but
don
t
you
think
young
man
that
god
don
t
remember
if
you
done
it
to
the
least
of
these
you
done
it
unto
me
don
t
you
think
you
can
push
a
young
man
into
hell
and
not
fall
into
the
fire
after
him
you
and
her
together
you
can
trust
god
for
that
she
exhausted
her
breath
and
stood
panting
come
on
missus
said
abner
heavily
you
ll
be
perished
out
but
when
he
clumsily
approached
her
she
ran
away
down
the
road
toward
mainstone
like
a
mad
woman
this
pathetic
bundle
of
burning
hatred
in
her
sunday
clothes
and
left
him
foolishly
standing
he
went
back
in
the
dark
to
wolfpits
heavily
burdened
with
the
second
part
of
his
task
the
children
were
playing
quietly
on
the
hearthrug
and
mrs
mumble
who
considered
it
only
neighbourly
to
give
mary
the
benefit
of
her
company
in
a
domestic
emergency
was
talking
of
homely
unimportant
things
with
the
idea
of
distracting
her
mind
from
the
more
tragic
affair
that
held
it
when
abner
appeared
she
excused
herself
kissed
the
children
enveloped
mary
in
a
more
significant
embrace
and
left
them
mary
stood
waiting
for
what
he
had
to
say
he
could
not
help
recognising
the
contrast
between
her
impressive
aloofness
her
and
the
hysterics
of
old
mrs
malpas
she
could
not
pretend
that
she
felt
nothing
since
george
s
disaster
however
little
she
might
care
for
him
must
bring
with
it
all
sorts
of
complications
she
was
a
woman
who
had
been
used
in
the
lavish
days
of
her
father
to
a
certain
degree
of
comfort
and
elegance
and
even
if
she
had
known
hard
times
at
wolfpits
during
george
s
freakish
periods
of
idleness
she
had
never
been
faced
with
anything
so
threatening
to
herself
and
her
children
as
a
complete
stoppage
of
wages
and
in
the
last
resort
the
humiliation
of
parish
relief
she
waited
with
her
head
erect
straight
as
a
larch
in
the
perfect
control
of
her
mind
it
s
what
we
thought
it
would
be
missus
he
said
manslaughter
they
brought
it
where
is
he
she
asked
almost
in
a
whisper
they
ve
took
him
in
charge
that
ll
mean
the
at
lesswardine
time
they
ve
got
the
case
ready
for
the
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
does
he
want
me
to
see
him
he
didn
t
say
nought
of
no
she
said
reflectively
he
said
tell
em
that
i
m
all
right
abner
explained
nowt
that
s
his
mother
ah
she
stiffened
a
little
and
abner
scenting
a
new
hostility
continued
this
business
bain
t
all
george
s
fault
it
s
a
bit
of
bad
luck
that
might
have
happened
to
any
one
it
might
just
as
well
a
been
me
as
well
and
better
if
that
bastard
hadn
t
gone
at
me
from
behind
george
d
never
have
touched
if
he
d
been
home
here
she
interrupted
with
a
sudden
energy
it
wouldn
t
have
happened
at
all
it
s
drink
that
s
done
for
george
she
added
he
hadn
t
a
drap
in
him
said
abner
loyally
he
was
as
sober
as
i
am
this
minute
he
hadn
t
set
foot
in
the
place
not
half
an
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
curious
directness
asked
where
had
he
been
then
how
should
i
know
where
he
d
been
i
don
t
meddle
or
mak
in
george
s
she
pressed
him
didn
t
it
come
out
at
the
inquest
where
he
d
been
he
saw
how
things
were
going
and
lied
brazenly
in
george
s
defence
no
he
said
well
that
s
one
comfort
she
said
with
a
sigh
i
ve
borne
enough
shame
from
george
without
that
then
as
her
suspicions
flashed
up
again
but
i
don
t
believe
you
they
don
t
let
things
like
that
i
don
t
know
what
you
m
oh
you
re
all
the
same
you
men
you
think
women
are
simple
enough
to
be
put
off
with
anything
it
s
you
who
are
simple
do
you
think
we
don
t
know
it
i
know
where
george
was
that
night
as
well
as
you
do
i
ve
known
of
his
new
fancy
for
three
months
now
that
woman
and
me
have
met
one
another
on
the
road
and
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
and
passed
the
time
of
day
and
not
another
word
because
we
knew
both
of
us
the
thing
was
best
hidden
and
it
would
humble
the
two
of
us
if
it
came
to
light
but
i
don
t
believe
they
d
let
a
thing
like
that
go
at
a
coroner
s
she
waited
for
his
reply
they
said
he
d
been
at
lesswardine
a
widow
woman
they
said
but
they
didn
t
tell
her
name
that
s
the
nothing
more
i
tell
you
that
s
the
lot
i
was
neyther
piller
nor
bo
ster
i
d
have
told
you
at
the
first
but
i
thought
to
save
your
feelings
she
repeated
there
s
better
ways
of
saving
a
woman
s
feelings
than
keeping
the
truth
from
her
that
was
george
s
way
if
you
guessed
anything
of
what
women
are
like
you
d
know
that
it
s
the
truth
they
want
you
can
forgive
a
man
a
lot
if
he
doesn
t
lie
to
her
tone
changed
suddenly
she
became
dispassionate
practical
once
more
when
will
it
come
on
at
the
police
court
i
don
t
know
i
reckon
they
won
t
keep
him
long
at
i
shall
have
to
go
there
she
said
even
if
he
doesn
t
want
me
it
s
my
place
to
be
there
if
i
don
t
go
there
george
will
think
that
i
ve
thrown
him
over
i
would
have
come
if
he
d
let
me
but
he
begged
me
not
to
he
s
funny
like
a
child
is
her
voice
softened
when
she
spoke
the
last
words
as
though
her
imagination
had
suddenly
carried
her
back
to
the
days
of
george
s
courtship
when
her
father
was
a
hearty
prosperous
man
and
no
troubles
whatever
had
entered
her
life
for
the
moment
she
seemed
to
abner
no
more
than
a
child
herself
at
the
first
moment
he
had
thought
her
insensitive
in
the
next
she
had
put
him
to
shame
by
her
frankness
now
she
was
yielding
pitiful
these
alternations
of
stoicism
passion
and
tenderness
bewildered
him
he
had
not
thought
that
women
were
so
various
in
addition
to
this
she
was
beautiful
he
wondered
what
perverse
strain
in
george
could
ever
have
compelled
him
to
desert
her
after
another
long
silence
she
thanked
him
for
what
he
had
told
her
then
turned
and
left
him
he
heard
her
talking
brightly
to
the
children
as
though
nothing
had
happened
although
darkness
had
fallen
it
was
still
early
abner
s
natural
impulse
would
have
bidden
him
walk
back
to
mainstone
and
find
susie
it
had
been
a
torment
to
see
her
cold
and
remote
seeming
no
more
to
him
than
a
stranger
in
the
hushed
when
he
had
stolen
out
at
the
moment
of
george
s
arrest
she
had
not
looked
at
him
he
had
left
her
staring
straight
in
front
of
her
like
a
pious
churchgoer
he
decided
in
the
end
to
stay
at
wolfpits
for
the
night
was
cold
and
unhomely
and
he
still
carried
in
his
mind
the
sinister
vision
of
the
empty
bar
with
bastard
s
body
lying
in
the
room
behind
it
more
than
this
he
began
to
be
conscious
of
a
definite
duty
toward
mary
whose
attitude
had
ended
by
filling
him
with
admiration
and
loyalty
he
felt
it
in
his
bones
that
she
despised
him
being
undeniably
a
creature
of
finer
clay
than
himself
but
the
moment
in
which
she
had
demanded
his
confidence
remained
with
him
it
was
as
though
the
veil
which
had
always
hung
between
them
had
been
suddenly
rent
admitting
them
to
an
intimacy
as
clear
as
light
in
all
his
life
he
had
known
no
such
experience
even
in
the
most
passionate
moments
of
his
relation
with
susie
she
had
been
no
more
to
him
than
a
strange
woman
for
whose
beauty
he
hungered
without
reason
he
knew
her
body
and
thrilled
to
it
but
of
herself
he
knew
nothing
with
mary
it
was
different
at
first
he
had
felt
vaguely
that
he
must
be
loyal
to
her
for
the
sake
of
his
friend
not
so
much
because
he
loved
george
as
because
their
friendship
had
been
the
immediate
cause
of
their
disaster
it
was
for
herself
that
he
must
now
be
loyal
and
this
seemed
strange
to
him
for
it
was
an
obligation
which
he
had
never
considered
as
possible
between
a
man
and
a
woman
and
nothing
but
that
sudden
moment
of
vision
could
have
revealed
it
to
him
he
devoted
his
evening
to
the
children
their
frolic
in
the
snow
had
excited
them
they
were
full
of
play
and
laughter
mary
moved
about
her
business
silently
watching
the
fireside
group
with
benevolent
eyes
at
seven
o
clock
just
before
their
bedtime
another
constable
came
to
the
door
with
the
summons
the
case
had
been
fixed
for
the
following
o
clock
at
lesswardine
the
man
was
in
a
hurry
to
serve
his
other
summonses
and
would
not
enter
abner
told
mary
the
news
eleven
o
clock
she
repeated
intently
come
thy
ways
morgan
love
time
for
the
children
left
abner
unwillingly
gladys
insisting
that
he
should
carry
her
upstairs
he
did
so
and
mary
followed
with
her
son
in
her
arms
rubbing
his
eyelids
with
his
fists
abner
returned
to
the
fire
eleven
o
clock
less
than
hours
ago
none
of
this
had
happened
he
was
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
with
the
inevitable
regularity
of
the
machine
that
had
drawn
george
malpas
into
its
ponderous
clutches
he
saw
for
the
first
time
the
tremendous
power
of
the
law
and
his
own
helplessness
mrs
mamble
joined
them
for
supper
when
they
had
nearly
finished
another
knock
came
to
the
door
and
abner
went
to
open
it
the
new
visitor
was
old
drew
who
came
in
blinking
at
the
light
please
come
in
mr
drew
said
mary
and
take
a
he
stood
for
a
moment
a
bowed
and
awkward
figure
then
he
placed
on
the
tablecloth
three
brown
eggs
that
he
had
carried
in
his
huge
misshapen
hand
i
bringed
you
two
three
eggs
missus
he
said
they

getting
tarrable
scarce
these
days
and
i
reckon

chilring

of
you
mr
drew
mary
cried

the
old

god
i
had
a
brother
of
my
own
to
lapton
huish
as
was
took
for
the
killing
of
his
wife
though
the
poor
twoad
never

and

exeter
he
were
dear
soul
too
iss
i
know
what
trouble
we
all
know
what
trouble
means
said
mrs
mamble
with
a
sigh
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
but
the
law
be
kinder
these
days
than
it
used
to
be
my
poor
dear
robert
s
grandfather
was
a
labourin
man
a
quiet
christian
man
too
as
never
raised
a
hand
against
any
livin
creature
as
robert
told
me
times
but
that
weren
t
enough
to
save
him
from
hanging
it
was
a
hard
winter
i
can
t
mind
how
many
years
agone
though
robert
he
told
me
and
they
got
him
for
stealing
a
they
says
he
found
in
the
snow
on
clee
hills
as
he
d
a
right
to
with
the
fields
like
stone
and
no
work
and
the
children
crying
for
bread
but
they
hanged
men
for
that
in
worcester
jail
in
them
days
ay
and
when
my
robert
was
a
lad
the
other
boys
d
put
it
up
against
him
as
his
dad
had
kept
sheep
by
moonlight
that
s
what
they
call
hanging
in
chains
like
the
gibbet
so
they
call
it
as
used
to
stand
in
olden
times
near
clows
top
a
quieter
man
never
breathed
nor
a
better
worker
put
a
bit
more
wood
on
the
fire
mr
fellows
do
abner
threw
a
faggot
on
the
fire
and
the
flames
leapt
this
friendly
flicker
aided
perhaps
by
the
hypnotic
drone
of
mrs
mamble
s
voice
as
soothing
as
the
sound
of
running
water
or
the
midnight
rustle
of
poplars
so
encouraged
the
old
labourer
that
he
let
himself
sink
into
a
chair
by
the
corner
of
the
table
the
firelight
glinted
in
his
beard
and
abner
saw
that
his
full
lips
were
red
as
those
of
a
young
man
he
saw
also
mary
s
face
withdrawn
into
the
gloom
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
dreaming
her
mind
altogether
removed
from
the
voices
of
her
comforters
ay
said
drew
i
ve
heard
of
men
that
was
strung
up
for
stealing
sheep
down
exmoor
way
there
s
a
many
sheep
on
the
moors
and
ponies
too
you
should
see
them
when
the
foals
come
along
springtime
and
when
they
m
drove
down
to
bampton
fair
tis
a
fine
sight
sure
nuff
but
that
there
s
nothing
to
the
old
times
my
granf
er
er

far
from

same
as

or
magpies

a
tarrable
old
chap

the
name

that

t
what
it
used
to
be
there

days

thing
that

they
do
call

down
our
no
shame
as
you
say
mr
drew
said
mrs
mamble
solemnly
but
the
shame
s
not
everything
it
s
a
hard
thing
on
a
woman
that
has
little
children
with
her
crying
for
an
empty
belly
when
a
man
s
away
in
jail
and
not
a
penny
in
the
house
but
what
the
parish
gives
her
and
the
questions
they
ask
that
s
where
the
shame
comes
in
and
i
ve
known
many
a
proud
woman
starve
for
a
crust
of
bread
rather
than
answer
them
they
re
that
ah

said
old
drew
with
a
laugh
what
s
questions
and
mrs
malpas
here
ban
t
going
to
do
no
such
thing
a
woman
never
knows
what
friends
she

got
till
she

found
trouble
and
they
that
has
a
roof
to
their
heads
and
a
bit
of
garden
to
till

spare
something
for
their
neighbours

now
that

a
fine
thing
to

he
went
on
with
a
glance
of
admiration
a
fine
thing
to
have
a
clock
to
tell
ee
when
to
be
going
up
over
and
keep
ee
company
tis
hard
to
judge
the
hour
in
winter
when
the
old
sun

hid
he
pulled
his
stiff
limbs
together
painfully
and
left
them
with
more
encouragements

quiet
man
said
mrs
mamble
when
they
heard
him
treading
softly
over
the
snow
but
i
always
reckoned
he
d
be
a
good
she
seemed
loath
to
leave
mary
to
herself
and
even
proposed
that
she
should
sleep
with
her
nominally
for
the
sake
of
warmth
until
the
strain
of
george
s
trial
should
be
over
an
offer
that
mary
found
it
difficult
to
refuse
with
grace
when
she
left
them
she
took
the
younger
woman
to
her
breast
and
kissed
her
tenderly
abner
opened
the
door
for
her
and
when
he
returned
he
saw
that
mary
s
eyes
were
bright
with
tears
he
felt
that
he
himself
must
struggle
to
add
some
words
of
reassurance
but
before
he
could
do
so
she
had
said
and
vanished
next
morning
he
rose
early
he
had
lit
the
fire
and
made
the
kettle
boil
before
she
was
astir
when
she
heard
his
feet
in
the
kitchen
she
hurried
to
come
down
and
thank
him
you
needn
t
have
done
that
she
said
that
s
nowt
he
replied
bluntly
we
ve
got
to
get
on
the
road
after
breakfast
she
deposited
the
children
as
had
been
arranged
with
mrs
mamble
morgan
who
scarcely
ever
left
his
mother
s
side
resented
this
where
are
you
going
mam
he
cried
only
to
lesswardine
with
abner
you
re
not
going
for
good
mam
you
re
coming
back
again
don
t
be
a
silly
boy
morgan
of
course
i
m
coming
when
mam
this
a
new
anxiety
seized
him
what
s
for
dinner
mam
he
said
a
nice
brown
egg
my
love
what
mr
drew
brought
you
said
mrs
mamble
coming
to
the
rescue
you
come
along
now
and
you
shall
have
dear
robert
s
watch
to
play
to
the
last
temptation
morgan
succumbed
this
watch
was
the
principal
curiosity
of
mrs
mamble
s
bedroom
it
hung
there
in
the
smell
of
rotting
wood
a
silver
monster
like
a
toy
suspended
in
a
celluloid
case
above
the
old
woman
s
bed
mrs
mamble
whipped
them
away
and
abner
set
out
with
mary
snow
still
covered
the
ground
but
by
this
time
in
lane
and
road
the
trampled
ways
were
clear
and
the
bordering
drifts
marked
with
the
treading
of
birds
squirrels
and
other
woodland
creatures
abner
was
so
unused
to
walking
with
a
woman
that
he
set
a
pace
that
mary
could
not
equal
breathless
she
begged
him
to
walk
more
slowly
the
exertion
and
the
cold
air
flushed
her
cheeks
and
reddened
her
lips
to
the
hue
of
holly
and
in
the
hedge
her
body
glowed
and
her
hair
was
bright
as
the
fronds
of
bracken
in
the
sun
in
spite
of
their
tragic
mission
her
lips
smiled
no
spiritual
anxiety
could
check
the
exhilaration
of
the
blood
that
this
crisp
winter
morning
gave
her
walking
under
the
open
sky
but
when
they
drew
near
to
lesswardine
the
houses
closed
in
on
them
like
the
walls
of
a
prison
the
fine
snow
was
swept
and
sullied
the
light
faded
from
the
sky
a
special
court
had
been
summoned
to
deal
with
george
s
case
the
squire
sir
george
delahay
was
driving
down
to
take
the
chair
and
before
abner
and
mary
arrived
the
was
nearly
full
of
lesswardine
villagers
who
could
always
spare
a
morning
if
anything
sensational
was
passing
abner
as
one
of
the
principal
witnesses
was
soon
separated
from
his
companion
he
was
herded
together
with
the
others
into
a
small
block
of
chairs
on
the
side
of
the
bench
and
opposite
to
the
dock
from
this
point
he
could
see
the
court
a
mass
of
white
faces
from
which
arose
a
rumour
like
the
buzzing
of
flies
in
the
midst
of
them
he
saw
mary
pale
and
innocent
it
was
in
her
agony
that
these
buzzing
tormentors
would
find
delight
almost
on
a
level
with
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
bench
he
saw
old
mrs
malpas
she
had
come
to
the
court
as
she
would
have
come
to
chapel
in
the
same
dour
determined
spirit
in
the
same
tight
black
dress
they
sat
abreast
of
one
another
these
two
women
to
whom
george
malpas
belonged
and
not
a
glance
passed
between
them
a
new
witness
arrived
a
fair
young
woman
clothed
in
black
and
veiled
who
walked
in
hurriedly
with
lowered
eyes
and
tried
to
conceal
herself
as
it
seemed
behind
the
chairs
of
the
men
the
flies
buzzed
as
loudly
as
when
they
are
driven
from
a
heap
of
filth
abner
guessed
that
this
was
george
s
lesswardine
woman
mrs
malpas
darted
one
eager
glance
in
the
s
direction
but
mary
did
not
raise
her
eyes
at
the
last
moment
mr
hind
entered
with
susie
she
smiled
and
the
sight
of
her
made
abner
s
blood
leap
for
she
was
no
longer
the
impersonal
being
that
she
had
seemed
at
the
inquest
she
met
his
eyes
full
and
smiled
again
mary
also
was
looking
at
him
now
abner
went
hot
under
their
two
glances
why
did
mary
look
at
him
the
other
was
the
woman
that
he
wanted
in
a
sudden
silence
george
was
brought
forward
he
seemed
none
the
worse
for
his
night
in
the
cells
he
walked
straight
to
the
dock
with
a
policeman
on
either
side
of
him
looking
neither
at
his
mother
whose
hands
went
to
her
heart
nor
at
mary
who
did
not
move
his
eyes
found
abner
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
court
and
he
smiled
but
the
smile
suddenly
vanished
and
he
went
pale
for
beyond
abner
he
had
seen
the
face
of
the
woman
from
lesswardine
he
went
pale
with
anger
that
they
should
have
dragged
her
into
this
but
there
was
no
one
on
whom
his
anger
could
fall
his
hands
that
had
quickly
clutched
at
the
edge
of
the
dock
fell
to
his
sides
he
stood
there
with
his
fine
pale
face
and
black
hair
and
on
him
were
centred
the
emotions
of
those
three
women
who
would
not
look
at
each
other
the
court
buzzed
again
going
suddenly
silent
as
badger
s
master
entered
and
took
his
seat
on
the
bench
above
the
head
of
the
clerk
the
proceedings
were
formal
being
no
more
than
another
step
in
george
s
journey
to
salop
the
only
new
witness
was
the
young
woman
whom
the
police
had
unearthed
to
establish
the
sequence
of
george
s
movements
on
the
night
of
bastard
s
death
she
gave
her
evidence
in
a
subdued
voice
and
never
raised
her
eyes
she
said
that
george
had
never
taken
liquor
in
her
house
that
he
had
often
come
to
see
her
that
he
was
her
friend
no
more
when
she
had
left
the
box
george
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
abner
wondered
why
he
should
have
preferred
this
shrinking
creature
to
mary
or
to
susie
hind
the
sitting
ended
in
the
obvious
way
george
being
committed
to
take
his
trial
at
the
county
assizes
nothing
else
could
have
been
expected
at
the
door
of
the
court
abner
rejoined
mary
mrs
malpas
who
had
been
whispering
to
the
local
solicitor
marched
past
them
without
speaking
and
mary
flushed
at
this
deliberate
slight
she
won
t
speak
to
me
she
said
i
think
that
s
too
bad
that
was
lawyer
harley
she
was
talking
don
t
take
no
notice
of
her
said
abner
that
old
woman
s
he
went
on
to
tell
her
that
mick
connor
who
had
gone
to
the
buffalo
out
of
curiosity
the
night
before
had
heard
mrs
malpas
tell
one
of
her
customers
that
if
george
were
sent
to
shrewsbury
she
would
employ
the
best
criminal
advocate
on
the
circuit
even
if
it
cost
her
the
last
penny
she
possessed
he
did
not
tell
her
that
mrs
malpas
had
declared
that
it
was
nothing
but
the
proud
ways
of
mary
that
thief
s
daughter
she
called
had
driven
george
to
his
ruin
he
didn
t
look
at
me
once
said
mary
on
the
way
home
he
d
no
call
to
look
at
nobody
abner
replied
he
looked
at
said
mary
bitterly
he
s
strange
i
don
t
know
what
to
make
of
that
s
natural
enough
he
didn
t
want
to
see
her
dragged
out
in
dragged
out
in
public
she
cried
with
an
unusual
flush
of
spirit
what
about
they
settled
down
to
another
placid
evening
at
wolfpits
the
children
had
enjoyed
their
day
with
mrs
mamble
though
morgan
was
persuaded
with
difficulty
to
go
to
bed
without
the
coveted
under
his
pillow
mrs
mamble
was
just
preparing
to
leave
them
for
the
night
when
a
knock
came
to
the
door
and
without
waiting
for
it
to
be
opened
to
her
mrs
malpas
entered
her
walk
to
wolfpits
over
the
roadway
now
slippery
with
ice
had
exhausted
her
so
that
she
looked
more
like
a
wraith
than
a
woman
even
so
she
did
not
stop
to
recover
her
breath
she
clenched
her
hands
in
the
queer
gesture
that
abner
had
noticed
the
evening
before
and
with
trembling
wrists
began
to
storm
in
mary
s
face
what
have
you
done
with
the
money
she
cried
what
have
you
done
with
it
abner
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
for
she
looked
dangerous
take
your
hands
off
me
she
screamed
the
money
i
want
my
money
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
mary
said
my
money

brazen
madam
she
cried
the
money
out
of
the
box
in
father
s
bedroom
more
than
fifty
pound
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
repeated
mary
bewildered
it
s
gone
gone
don
t
tell
me
you
don
t
know
where
it
s
gone
when
i
know
you
ve

he

t
have
spent
it
all
give
me
what

left
to
pay
the
lawyers
george
would
never
have
gone
and
took
it
without
you
to
put
him
up
to
it
you
with
your
lady
s
ways
and
your
fine
speech
ah
that
s
where
the
bad
blood
comes
out
your
father
was
a
thief
and
you
re
no
better
bad
blood
bad
blood
don
t

dare
mary
cried
don
t
you
dare
speak
of
my
father
she
stood
tall
and
flushed
above
her
give
me
the
money
what
s
left
of
it
mrs
malpas
pleaded
give
it
me
and
i
won
t
say
no
her
violence
had
spent
itself
now
she
was
only
small
pathetic
withered
mary
controlled
herself
she
would
not
answer
i
d
forgive
him
taking
it
i
d
forgive
him
mr
harley
says
they

pound

case

pound

later

she
says
she

t
know
nothing

said
abner
it
must
have
been
george
no
one
else
knew
where
i
kept
it
he
s
hidden
it
up
in
his
room
you
must
look
you
must
look
i
know
nothing
about
it
said
mary
mastering
herself
i
ve
not
seen
a
penny
i
i
can
t
talk
to
you
i
wish
you
would
go
leave
the
woman
alone
missus
said
abner
she
s
enough
to
put
up
with
without
you
you
d
best
go
out
quiet
you
m
not
answerable
come
on
now
the
old
woman
seemed
to
pull
her
strength
together
looking
from
one
to
the
other
they
waited
for
a
new
outburst
but
instead
of
speaking
she
suddenly
threw
up
her
hands
and
burst
into
a
fit
of
choking
sobs
mary
made
a
compassionate
movement
toward
her
but
mrs
malpas
stopped
her
with
a
violent
gesture
then
she
straightened
her
bonnet
and
moved
to
the
door
she
became
her
old
wiry
deliberate
self
her
voice
was
clear
and
her
face
like
stone
if
george
took
it
she
said
emphatically
it
was
the
devil
that
drove
him
and
i
can
t
do
no
more
but
not
one
penny
shall
you
ever
get
out
of
me
mary
condover
you
can
starve
you
and
your
children
together
but
don
t
come
crying
to
dad
and
me
you
and
your
pride
now
you
can
see
what
you
ve
to
be
proud
of
the
daughter
of
a
thief
and
the
wife
of
a
thief
that
s
what
you
are
i
never
want
to
set
eyes
on
you
again
you
and
your
fancy
lodger
she
went
out
leaving
the
door
open
behind
her
mary
stood
looking
after
her
shaken
like
a
tree
in
the
wind
then
she
gave
a
curious
laugh
and
sat
down
at
the
table
abner
could
do
nothing
for
her
but
she
managed
to
contain
herself
until
she
had
risen
and
passed
from
his
sight
upstairs
it
was
fortunate
for
them
all
in
the
suspense
that
now
held
them
that
the
shrewsbury
assizes
had
been
fixed
for
the
middle
of
december
immediately
before
the
christmas
vacation
on
his
committal
by
the
lesswardine
bench
george
had
been
taken
at
once
to
the
county
jail
where
he
lay
awaiting
his
trial
in
the
meantime
the
leisurely
routine
of
work
in
those
wintry
valleys
disturbed
so
abruptly
by
these
violent
events
reasserted
itself
the
snow
melted
to
the
sodden
days
of
thaw
succeeded
a
period
of
mild
and
mistily
golden
weather
that
would
have
seemed
like
spring
had
it
not
been
so
silent
the
work
on
the
pipeline
began
again
like
the
progress
of
some
great
engine
that
had
kept
its
power
hissing
beneath
the
snow
and
daily
gathered
speed
even
the
pound
house
still
suspect
by
the
police
but
happily
safe
until
the
brewster
sessions
regained
its
old
popularity
though
mr
hind
having
been
duly
warned
gave
more
attention
to
his
business
than
ever
before
it
had
been
clear
from
the
first
that
he
had
taken
a
violent
dislike
to
abner
whom
he
regarded
as
the
cause
of
all
his
trouble
on
the
day
of
the
inquest
he
had
shown
this
by
his
silence
but
when
abner
appeared
again
at
the
inn
he
told
him
in
as
many
words
that
his
custom
wasn
t
wanted
susie
a
little
shaken
by
her
father
s
severity
implored
him
not
to
persist
in
coming
to
the
pound
house
and
though
she
appeared
no
less
passionately
devoted
to
abner
the
lovers
meetings
were
fewer
and
their
secrecy
more
precarious
it
was
strange
how
little
difference
george
s
absence
made
to
life
at
wolfpits
within
a
week
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
place
and
its
inhabitants
had
forgotten
him
neither
mary
nor
the
children
ever
mentioned
his
name
and
since
the
day
of
the
proceedings
abner
had
heard
nothing
from
him
but
a
single
scribbled
letter
which
george
contrived
to
send
from
the
by
the
hand
of
the
young
policeman
who
had
drunk
his
beer
in
this
letter
a
new
flicker
of
care
for
his
family
had
shown
itself
he
had
reminded
abner
of
his
promise
to
stay
at
wolfpits
and
look
after
them
i
would
have
sent
you
some
money
he
wrote
but
they
ve
taken
it
off
me
mary
can
ask
mother
if
she
s
in
a
the
reminder
was
quite
unnecessary
abner
had
given
his
word
to
a
pal
and
meant
to
stick
to
it
though
he
foresaw
a
difficult
moment
when
the
plan
should
be
disclosed
to
mary
he
could
not
see
for
the
life
of
him
how
to
open
the
subject
and
so
he
let
things
take
their
course
waiting
for
the
occasion
to
arrive
without
his
interference
it
came
as
he
had
half
expected
at
the
end
of
the
week
when
the
next
payment
for
his
lodging
was
due
instead
of
his
usual
fourteen
shillings
he
gave
mary
the
whole
of
his
wages
wrapped
up
in
the
piece
of
paper
in
which
he
received
them
at
the
works
the
situation
embarrassed
her
as
she
told
him
for
she
had
no
change
i
don
t
want
none
he
said
bluntly
but
i
can
t
take
it
from
you
she
protested
it
isn
t
right
or
wrong
said
he
you
and
the
children
can
t
live
on
less
and
you
ll
find
it
a
tight
pinch
as
it
i
can
t
take
it
she
said
again
they
stood
on
either
side
of
the
table
with
the
packet
of
money
between
them
it
isn
t
only
that
she
added
don
t
suppose
i
think
the
less
of
your
kindness
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
what
i
do
think
but
i
m
afraid
it
isn
t
right
for
you
to
stay
on
here
now
george
is
that
s
why
i
ought
to
stay
he
said
you
don
t
understand
she
replied
men
don
t
think
of
such
things
it
would
be
the
talk
of
the
village
they
d
say
there
was
something
as
long
as
there
bain
t
nothing
wrong
there
s
no
harm
in
talk
talk
never
hurt
there
s
george
s
mother
you
don
t
know
her
remember
what
she
said
that
do
you
think
i
d
ever
take
the
upper
hand
of
you
no
no
it
s
not
me
she
said
quickly
turning
away
from
him
then
there
s
no
call
to
be
soft
over
there
s
george
too
don
t
you
fret
yourself
about
george
he
said
and
showed
her
her
husband
s
letter
that
s
what
george
thinks
about
it
i
reckon
that
s
good
for
a
long
time
she
would
not
take
his
money
the
hard
facts
of
her
case
the
words
of
mrs
malpas
and
the
ugly
necessity
of
applying
for
parish
relief
seemed
to
weigh
less
with
her
than
this
tyrannous
modesty
you
can
take
it
or
leave
it
he
said
but
i
ve
promised
george
and
the
money
will
come
to
you
just
the
same
supposing
i
get
another
lodge
the
money
will
be
less
that
s
all
if
you
bain
t
afeard
of
me
she
protested
no
no
then
i
may
as
well
stay
on
you
can
t
do
without
a
man
in
a
place
like
this
there
s
the
wood
to
chop
and
the
water
to
draw
and
that
i
should
have
to
come
here
just
the
same
we
ve
got
to
live
on
a
poor
wage
and
it
s
all
the
better
if
i
m
i
must
think
it
over
she
said
in
the
end
she
consented
to
his
for
herself
since
otherwise
life
would
have
been
almost
impossible
during
the
three
weeks
that
passed
before
george
s
trial
they
settled
down
into
a
new
and
orderly
condition
living
poorly
it
is
true
but
contentedly
and
aided
by
the
attentions
of
their
neighbours
mrs
mamble
perhaps
at
mary
s
request
often
softened
the
awkwardness
of
the
situation
by
dropping
in
about
and
staying
to
talk
over
the
fire
and
old
drew
was
continually
giving
the
children
presents
of
eggs
from
his
own
from
the
land
on
which
he
worked
and
even
some
of
the
milk
which
according
to
the
custom
in
those
parts
he
received
in
part
payment
of
his
wage
mary
could
not
refuse
these
gifts
so
beautifully
given
she
could
not
even
return
him
adequate
thanks
but
she
tried
to
add
a
little
to
the
comfort
of
the
rooms
in
which
the
old
man
lived
and
offered
to
attend
to
his
clothes
an
attempt
in
which
she
failed
since
drew
always
locked
his
door
when
he
left
it
in
the
dawn
resenting
in
the
manner
of
many
bachelors
the
least
interference
with
his
own
homely
dirt
and
wore
in
winter
every
shred
of
clothing
that
he
possessed
the
sense
of
an
obligation
unfulfilled
would
have
made
them
awkward
if
the
old
man
had
not
accepted
the
help
of
abner
in
his
garden
a
proceeding
that
he
watched
with
suspicion
being
as
fidgety
as
any
old
maid
and
that
of
mary
in
the
feeding
of
his
fowls
within
a
few
weeks
indeed
the
inhabitants
of
wolfpits
had
settled
down
into
a
kind
of
communal
life
that
was
happy
if
only
for
the
fact
that
its
existence
implied
so
much
goodwill
the
subpoenas
for
the
assizes
arrived
and
with
them
a
new
wave
of
rumour
and
excitement
troubled
the
villages
it
was
agreed
that
george
had
no
chance
of
being
acquitted
but
those
who
had
experience
of
the
law
vied
with
those
who
had
none
in
predicting
the
term
of
his
sentence
through
the
medium
of
susie
pound
house
gossip
filtered
back
to
abner
and
in
this
way
he
learned
that
mrs
malpas
had
managed
in
spite
of
her
loss
to
brief
a
barrister
named
rees
who
had
a
great
reputation
for
skill
in
criminal
defences
on
that
circuit
a
week
before
the
trial
abner
received
a
note
from
the
lesser
of
the
two
local
solicitors
who
being
a
liberal
and
a
nonconformist
had
nothing
to
lose
by
an
implied
opposition
to
the
squire
together
with
mick
connor
and
atwell
abner
repeated
his
version
of
the
affair
to
this
man
i
shall
let
mrs
malpas
senior
know
by
wire
when
the
case
is
likely
to
come
on
he
said
and
you
of
course
will
hold
yourselves
in
a
fortnight
later
mrs
malpas
sent
up
a
message
by
a
small
boy
from
chapel
green
to
wolfpits
telling
abner
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
set
out
for
shrewsbury
on
the
following
morning
the
message
made
no
mention
of
mary
but
i
shall
go
all
the
same
she
said
they
left
wolfpits
in
darkness
whispering
their
farewells
to
mrs
mamble
for
fear
of
waking
the
children
whom
mary
dressing
quietly
had
left
asleep
the
nearest
station
to
chapel
green
was
that
of
llandwlas
a
minute
hamlet
hidden
amid
the
springs
of
the
barbel
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
single
line
that
winds
painfully
out
of
wales
between
the
dominant
masses
of
the
forests
of
radnor
and
clun
from
wolfpits
this
made
a
walk
a
dripping
mist
hid
the
land
and
they
saw
no
soul
until
they
reached
the
station
there
on
the
raw
deserted
platform
where
the
porter
had
lit
a
single
oil
lamp
to
show
that
the
day
had
begun
they
waited
walking
up
and
down
to
keep
themselves
warm
they
were
early
and
the
only
other
sign
of
life
was
the
yellow
square
of
the
stationmaster
s
bedroom
in
the
adjoining
cottage
even
if
daylight
had
come
the
density
of
the
mist
would
have
given
them
the
same
sense
of
isolation
little
by
little
the
place
became
alive
first
a
float
drove
up
with
a
couple
of
next
came
a
gnomish
figure
who
carried
a
stick
with
dead
rabbits
slung
from
it
over
his
shoulder
then
a
noisy
party
of
two
whom
abner
recognised
as
his
that
s
connor
and
atwell
come
up
he
said
let
s
keep
at
the
other
end
mary
whispered
moving
away
two
more
traps
arrived
the
first
containing
the
hinds
the
second
badger
alone
and
last
the
small
energetic
figure
of
george
s
mother
all
these
people
whom
a
chance
blow
had
precipitated
into
the
same
grim
business
stood
waiting
for
the
train
singly
or
in
isolated
groups
of
two
a
straining
of
wires
was
heard
and
the
fogged
red
eye
of
the
signal
changed
to
green
the
stationmaster
threw
up
the
shutter
of
the
booking
office
with
a
rattle
abner
found
himself
wedged
in
front
of
the
window
between
badger
and
mr
hind
mrs
malpas
fidgeting
with
her
purse
stood
waiting
in
the
background
as
abner
rejoined
mary
a
sound
of
distant
panting
was
heard
and
a
minute
later
the
front
of
the
engine
loomed
enormous
through
the
fog
they
entered
a
smoker
at
the
end
of
the
train
the
were
rolled
over
the
echoing
platform
into
the
van
and
the
train
moved
off
with
a
clank
of
couplings
and
a
hiss
of
white
steam
down
through
the
valleys
mile
on
mile
they
wound
the
train
rocked
on
the
gradients
until
it
seemed
that
the
carriages
must
touch
the
black
edge
of
the
woods
the
mist
turned
white
and
dazzling
the
sun
had
risen
the
sixteenth
chapter
after
nightfall
on
the
same
evening
that
train
of
coaches
came
blundering
back
along
the
curves
of
the
llandwlas
line
the
snorting
of
its
engine
was
the
only
sound
as
its
yellow
windows
and
funnel
were
the
only
light
in
all
those
miles
of
woodland
and
valley
the
train
ran
late
as
usual
stuttering
up
the
gradients
as
though
the
weight
it
carried
were
too
much
for
the
power
of
its
groaning
pistons
scattered
through
the
various
compartments
of
its
three
short
coaches
sat
all
the
witnesses
of
george
s
condemnation
the
jury
having
no
alternative
had
found
him
guilty
of
manslaughter
and
the
judge
who
saw
in
front
of
him
a
programme
of
cases
more
important
than
this
flicker
of
violence
in
a
remote
agricultural
district
wasted
no
time
on
his
sentence
if
bastard
had
not
been
a
policeman
and
therefore
a
humble
symbol
of
the
code
which
his
lordship
administered
if
the
witness
badger
had
not
been
a
gamekeeper
which
was
much
the
same
thing
george
might
easily
have
escaped
with
a
few
months
imprisonment
or
half
a
year
s
at
most
the
barrister
whom
mrs
malpas
had
employed
for
the
defence
realised
this
the
fact
that
he
was
most
eager
to
establish
seemed
to
be
that
george
was
not
and
had
never
been
a
poacher
and
that
he
was
not
on
bad
terms
with
the
man
he
had
killed
mrs
malpas
sitting
in
the
public
gallery
on
the
bench
in
front
of
mary
listened
eagerly
her
heart
sank
as
she
listened
to
the
evidence
the
words
that
she
had
heard
before
in
the
at
lesswardine
for
she
had
expected
that
the
little
man
in
the
gray
wig
who
had
shaken
hands
with
her
an
hour
before
in
consideration
of
the
thirty
pounds
that
she
had
scraped
together
to
pay
him
would
throw
some
new
and
startling
light
upon
the
case
reducing
badger
to
tears
and
confounding
the
lesswardine
police
she
had
expected
thunders
and
passionate
appeals
to
the
mercy
of
the
jury
instead
of
this
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
with
a
jewish
lisp
and
even
cracked
a
joke
at
which
the
jury
smiled
with
one
of
the
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
the
old
woman
felt
that
she
had
been
betrayed
seeking
ideal
justice
she
had
found
something
trivial
and
cynical
the
whole
business
was
nearly
over
before
she
realised
that
it
had
begun
the
judge
summed
up
lazily
only
pitching
his
voice
when
he
dwelt
upon
the
necessity
of
such
men
as
bastard
to
the
public
safety
and
the
very
existence
of
property
the
jury
retired
for
less
than
two
minutes
the
judge
gave
sentence
of
eighteen
months
hard
labour
and
the
white
face
of
george
who
had
stood
like
a
statue
throughout
the
trial
disappeared
from
the
dock
when
she
looked
again
she
saw
that
another
man
who
looked
like
a
tramp
had
entered
it
people
around
her
began
to
talk
for
this
was
a
case
of
real
murder
and
this
creature
was
to
fight
for
his
life
only
then
did
the
old
woman
realise
that
george
s
case
was
over
she
passed
mary
in
the
door
of
the
gallery
and
hurried
downstairs
where
the
counsel
whom
she
had
briefed
congratulated
her
on
the
issue
of
the
case
while
she
was
engaged
with
him
and
with
harley
the
solicitor
mary
passed
her
and
joined
abner
on
the
steps
of
the
court
mrs
malpas
in
the
middle
of
her
conversation
gave
them
a
queer
sidelong
glance
that
filled
mary
with
uneasiness
i
don
t
think
we
had
better
go
home
together
she
whispered
come
on
and
get
a
spot
of
tea
he
said
i
reckon
you
must
be
clammed
and
there
s
near
an
hour
before
the
train
it
made
her
flurried
and
impatient
to
think
that
abner
had
not
understood
her
i
don
t
want
you
to
be
with
me
she
said
she
s
watching
us
don
t
you
see
let
her
watch
said
abner
looking
round
in
a
way
that
made
mrs
malpas
sure
that
they
had
been
speaking
of
her
come
on
but
she
slipped
away
from
him
in
the
crowd
outside
the
steps
so
quickly
that
he
could
not
very
well
follow
her
with
dignity
at
the
same
moment
connor
and
atwell
appeared
and
solved
his
perplexity
by
dragging
him
off
into
a
mick
gave
the
ball
a
kick
as
he
called
it
with
a
round
of
irish
whisky
none
of
them
had
tasted
any
food
since
they
left
their
homes
before
dawn
and
the
spirit
soon
went
into
abner
s
head
they
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
bar
laughing
uproariously
at
mick
s
ridiculous
stories
and
making
outrageous
plans
for
getting
their
own
back
on
badger
indeed
if
the
clock
in
the
bar
had
not
struck
to
warn
them
of
the
time
they
would
have
missed
their
train
they
had
to
hurry
down
the
steep
hill
to
shrewsbury
station
lights
were
gleaming
in
the
muddy
streets
and
in
the
windows
of
tall
houses
above
them
hung
the
threatening
mass
of
the
castle
that
s
where
poor
old
george
will
get
his
lodging
said
mick
this
time
eighteen
month
said
atwell
solemnly
ah
not
at
all
said
mick
sure
he
ll
be
out
and
about
next
winter
if
he
plays
his
at
the
station
they
found
they
had
still
a
few
minutes
to
spare
and
abner
s
hazy
intention
of
looking
for
mary
was
lost
in
another
rush
to
the
just
before
the
train
started
he
ran
along
the
carriages
to
see
if
he
could
find
her
in
one
carriage
he
saw
mrs
malpas
in
another
three
lesswardine
policemen
in
a
third
mr
hind
was
sitting
with
susie
who
smiled
at
him
mary
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
mick
pulled
him
into
a
smoker
as
the
train
was
starting
god
help
me
said
he
is
it
crazed
you
are
that
you
can
t
leave
the
woman
five
minutes
to
herself
you
ll
be
seeing
all
you
want
of
her
time
her
george
comes
atwell
laughed
stupidly
abner
jumped
up
in
a
rage
and
was
for
throwing
connor
through
the
window
ah
be
quiet
now
mick
persuaded
for
i
don
t
mane
a
word
of
it
abner
settled
down
sulkily
atwell
had
already
forgotten
the
incident
and
was
snoring
in
his
corner
mick
hummed
quietly
the
song
about
macarthy
spitting
through
a
chink
in
the
window
between
the
verses
the
train
jolted
on
into
the
darkness
crossing
the
deep
valley
of
severn
skirting
the
eastern
foothills
of
the
long
mynd
sliding
down
with
braked
engine
into
the
basin
of
teme
at
craven
arms
a
welsh
cattle
dealer
joined
them
a
small
man
who
eyed
them
suspiciously
and
would
not
be
drawn
into
talk
with
mick
connor
the
train
climbed
painfully
the
air
grew
colder
atwell
s
snores
joined
with
the
clanking
of
the
wheels
to
set
a
spell
of
drowsiness
on
abner
s
fuddled
brain
he
fell
asleep
at
llandwlas
mick
woke
him
they
tumbled
out
on
to
the
deserted
platform
mary
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
she
had
slipped
him
again
and
though
he
was
inclined
to
be
angry
at
this
unreasonable
conduct
he
submitted
to
mick
s
suggestion
that
they
should
walk
back
to
chapel
green
together
and
get
another
drink
two
traps
passed
them
on
the
road
flinging
an
uncertain
light
upon
the
frosty
hedges
from
the
first
of
them
susie
called
in
the
second
they
could
see
the
helmets
of
the
police
but
no
trace
either
of
mrs
malpas
or
mary
was
to
be
seen
on
the
road
the
sleep
had
cleared
abner
s
head
they
walked
quickly
through
the
raw
air
and
in
a
little
more
than
an
hour
they
saw
the
poplars
of
chapel
green
what
about
a
drop
at
the
buffalo
said
mick
even
from
a
distance
they
could
see
that
this
forbidding
resort
had
become
unusually
cheerful
it
was
now
the
time
of
evening
at
which
the
labouring
men
who
formed
the
greater
part
of
mrs
malpas
s
customers
finished
their
quarts
and
went
home
to
bed
as
the
three
men
approached
many
voices
were
heard
sounds
as
if
there
s
a
drop
stirrin
said
mick
by
the
houly
an
so
there
will
be
there
s
the
pound
house
after
being
closed
on
them
with
mr
hind
and
susan
away
he
opened
the
door
and
a
mist
of
tobacco
smoke
met
the
colder
air
at
the
same
moment
a
tall
musical
box
shaped
like
a
grandfather
clock
and
worked
by
a
apparatus
struck
up
the
tune
of
champagne
charlie
in
front
of
it
beating
time
with
a
pint
pot
dangerously
full
stood
wigan
joe
the
man
was
drunk
as
were
most
of
the
other
cloggers
who
crowded
the
bar
at
his
right
hand
next
the
fire
sat
old
mr
malpas
following
with
anxious
eyes
the
evolutions
of
the
big
man
s
tankard
the
room
was
so
full
of
smoke
and
occupied
by
the
jingle
of
the
musical
box
that
abner
and
his
friends
entered
without
the
clogger
realising
that
they
were
there
that
s
a
good
rousing
tune
lad
he
cried
leaning
over
mr
malpas
and
beating
out
the
rhythm
with
his
free
hand
on
the
old
man
s
shoulder
eh
it
s
a
grand
night
is
this
makes
you
feel
like
you
re
young
again
let
s
have
another
bloody
penn
orth
mr
malpas
nodded
smiling
feebly
fumbling
in
his
pocket
for
the
coin
he
became
aware
of
abner
mick
and
atwell
by
gum
lads
is
that
you
tell
us
quick
what
s
happened
they
give
him
eighteen
months
said
abner
the
said
joe
under
his
breath
he
took
them
aside
and
explained
that
he
and
his
mates
had
thought
that
old
mr
malpas
would
be
with
george
in
trouble
and
his
missus
away
we
thought
we
d
stay
in
and
brighten
things
up
a
bit
to
take
his
mind
off
it
like
we
ve
had
a
nice
bit
of
harmony
he
said
eighteen
months
well
that
s
a
that
is
at
this
moment
the
musical
box
after
one
or
two
metallic
protests
inharmoniously
stopped
in
the
middle
of
its
chorus
joe
threw
a
penny
to
the
man
who
sat
nearest
to
it
ere
put
in
another
copper
he
said
an
wind
the
blasted
thing
the
clockwork
grated
and
the
tune
began
again
don
t
say
a
word
to
the
old
un
he
said
keep
his
mind
off
it
that
s
the
with
this
end
in
view
he
left
them
and
poked
old
malpas
who
had
now
relapsed
into
a
state
of
nodding
imbecility
in
the
ribs
do
you
see
that
there
gun
dad
he
shouted
malpas
stared
vaguely
gun
he
repeated
don
t
you
go
telling
me
you
don
t
know
what
a
gun
is
he
pointed
to
an
old
muzzle
loader
that
hung
above
the
hearth
oh
ay
gun
said
old
malpas
blandly
wigan
joe
bent
over
him
and
began
to
declaim
in
his
ear
an
endless
and
as
it
seemed
pointless
story
of
how
he
had
once
gone
out
with
a
friend
to
shoot
crows
how
he
had
seen
a
crow
on
a
haystack
on
the
parish
boundary
and
how
his
friend
after
taking
careful
aim
had
missed
it
at
this
point
he
raised
his
voice
still
louder
by
gum
lad
i
says
you
re
the
first
ever
i
knew
that
shot
at
a
haystack
and
missed
a
parish
with
the
last
words
he
gave
the
old
man
a
hearty
slap
on
the
back
and
malpas
collapsed
into
a
feeble
fit
of
laughter
shot
at
a
haystack
and
missed
a
parish
the
clogger
repeated
roaring
at
his
own
joke
and
presenting
it
to
the
company
who
were
now
in
a
condition
to
laugh
at
anything
at
the
same
moment
the
door
opened
and
mrs
malpas
entered
joe
steadied
himself
the
others
were
silent
at
the
sight
of
her
small
tragic
figure
only
the
musical
box
continued
to
jangle
out
its
tune
and
the
old
man
to
be
shaken
with
equally
mechanical
chuckles
she
did
not
speak
but
took
in
the
whole
assembly
with
her
eyes
evening
ma
am
said
the
clogger
we
ve
been
giving
the
old
gentleman
a
bit
of
a
tune
to
liven
him
up
like
and
make
him
forget
his
without
answering
she
stepped
straight
over
to
the
musical
box
and
pulled
a
lever
that
stopped
it
then
she
shook
the
shoulder
of
her
husband
who
had
not
yet
realised
her
coming
what
s
up
with
you
dad
she
cried
are
you
stark
mad
it
s
all
right
mother
he
replied
feebly
right
she
cried
then
she
turned
on
the
others
out
of
this
she
said
out
of
this
every
one
of
you
as
if
there
wasn
t
enough
shame
and
sorrow
in
this
house
without
your
mocking
it
with
your
drink
and
your
music
out
of
it
i
say
and
she
waved
her
arms
as
though
she
were
driving
cattle
now
don
t
take
on
so
ma
am
said
wigan
joe
mildly
it
was
all
meant
for
the
best
can
t
you
let
the
man
forget
his
troubles
it
s
a
poor
heart
that
never
rejoices
don
t
speak
to
me
she
cried
angrily
to
think
that
you
have
the
face
to
come
here
you
that
led
him
astray
with
your
drink
and
your
bawdiness
to
come
and
make
a
mock
of
his
own
father
her
eyes
fell
on
abner
who
had
risen
to
go
to
the
door
and
that
man
she
cried
whipping
herself
up
into
a
white
paroxysm
of
rage
that
man
who
if
all
had
their
rights
would
be
in
the
dock
and
in
the
prison
where
my
son
is
lying
that
s
the
man
he
s
suffering
for
that
s
the
serpent
he
took
into
his
bosom
she
stood
before
abner
spitting
like
a
snake
herself
never
let
me
see
your
face
again
she
cried
never
come
nigh
this
door
it
was
the
devil
that
sent
you
to
bring
trouble
on
a
good
christian
house
again
wigan
joe
protested
the
innocence
of
his
intentions
while
the
old
man
sat
nodding
by
the
fire
as
if
the
storm
had
broken
without
him
knowing
it
don
t
talk
to
me
she
said
with
the
liquor
in
your
breath
go
away
and
leave
us
abner
went
out
the
other
men
were
standing
on
the
pavement
laughing
mick
implored
him
to
go
on
with
them
to
the
pound
house
where
mr
hind
and
susie
had
by
this
time
presumably
arrived
but
he
shook
his
head
and
took
the
road
to
wolfpits
pondering
through
the
darkness
of
night
on
the
curious
turn
which
his
fortune
had
taken
he
had
now
time
to
think
about
mary
and
the
unreasonable
obstinacy
she
had
shown
in
leaving
him
on
the
steps
of
the
court
and
later
avoiding
him
both
at
shrewsbury
and
llandwlas
he
felt
a
little
concerned
that
she
should
have
chosen
to
walk
so
many
miles
through
the
dark
rather
than
submit
to
his
company
after
all
it
would
have
been
only
natural
for
them
to
go
home
together
he
had
always
treated
her
with
respect
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
history
of
their
acquaintance
that
should
have
made
her
shy
of
him
it
were
perhaps
that
one
curious
moment
on
the
night
when
they
had
carried
george
upstairs
between
them
and
put
him
to
bed
then
he
had
told
her
in
george
s
defence
of
his
own
intimacy
with
susie
hind
and
this
revelation
instead
of
putting
her
at
ease
as
it
should
have
done
had
actually
seemed
to
embarrass
her
this
knowledge
however
gave
her
no
reason
for
her
present
behaviour
indeed
if
she
knew
him
to
be
so
thick
with
susie
there
was
surely
less
cause
than
ever
for
her
to
be
shy
with
him
herself
he
gave
women
never
knew
where
you
were
with
them
he
supposed
that
nothing
but
fear
of
mrs
malpas
was
at
the
bottom
of
mary
s
queer
behaviour
i
don
t
want
you
to
be
with
me
she
s
watching
us
she
had
said
when
she
gave
him
the
slip
at
shrewsbury
another
memory
of
mrs
malpas
returned
to
him
the
end
of
her
outburst
at
wolfpits
when
she
had
come
in
search
of
her
money
you
and
your
fancy
lodger
she
had
screamed
abner
laughed
to
himself
it
was
clear
that
mary
hadn
t
much
of
a
fancy
for
him
at
present
all
the
same
he
couldn
t
entirely
dismiss
mrs
malpas
from
his
thoughts
she
had
shown
herself
definitely
hostile
to
him
and
his
last
vision
of
her
clearing
the
bar
of
the
buffalo
a
puny
figure
with
white
cheeks
burning
eyes
and
nodding
plume
of
jet
showed
him
her
fanatical
strength
stronger
for
the
fact
that
she
regarded
herself
in
her
most
violent
moments
as
a
representative
of
the
right
and
the
rest
of
the
world
as
inspired
by
the
devil
yet
he
couldn
t
get
away
from
the
ludicrous
side
of
her
and
found
himself
chuckling
in
the
dark
poor
old
soul
he
thought
she
dain
t
know
what
she
wants
and
that
s
the
truth
but
mrs
malpas
did
know
what
she
wanted
mary
had
gone
to
bed
when
he
reached
wolfpits
but
she
had
left
his
supper
ready
on
the
kitchen
table
he
ate
his
bread
and
cheese
and
drank
his
beer
that
night
exhausted
with
the
strain
of
the
day
he
slept
heavily
so
the
new
life
began
if
george
malpas
lying
in
shrewsbury
jail
returned
in
one
of
the
debauches
of
sentiment
to
which
his
nature
was
subject
to
the
idea
of
his
desolate
wife
and
family
and
dwelt
on
it
with
pity
or
remorse
he
might
well
have
spared
himself
the
luxury
of
these
emotions
there
were
few
changes
at
wolfpits
the
children
knew
that
they
need
no
longer
expect
the
violent
attentions
which
george
gave
them
when
he
felt
like
it
spider
the
bitch
settled
down
to
a
life
untroubled
by
george
s
kicks
and
stones
while
mary
that
strange
and
secret
creature
was
spared
at
least
the
alternations
of
reproaches
and
endearments
which
made
up
the
greater
part
of
her
marriage
george
had
vanished
from
her
life
for
three
months
at
least
no
word
no
sign
from
him
might
reach
her
it
was
true
that
the
family
had
to
live
more
simply
abner
s
wages
which
she
now
took
without
question
every
saturday
night
could
buy
them
nothing
more
than
the
absolute
necessities
of
life
and
even
so
must
be
spent
with
care
but
it
pleased
her
to
think
that
she
was
managing
on
them
and
that
not
one
penny
went
on
frivolous
things
abner
himself
kept
back
no
more
than
a
couple
of
shillings
for
tobacco
every
week
to
drink
was
out
of
the
question
and
it
now
seemed
to
him
fortunate
that
mr
hind
in
a
fit
of
temper
should
have
warned
him
off
the
pound
house
he
now
spent
most
of
his
evenings
at
home
sitting
before
the
fire
with
gladys
on
his
knee
and
making
catapults
or
other
wooden
weapons
for
morgan
with
his
knife
even
in
so
small
a
household
as
theirs
there
was
plenty
of
rough
work
that
a
man
could
do
not
only
in
the
way
of
digging
and
dressing
the
garden
and
hewing
wood
for
the
fires
but
actually
in
patching
up
the
crumbled
fabric
of
wolfpits
which
left
to
the
mercies
of
rain
and
frost
would
have
fallen
about
their
heads
the
sudden
intimacy
with
their
neighbours
into
which
george
s
arrest
had
thrown
them
continued
and
the
more
abner
detached
himself
from
the
life
of
the
cloggers
and
of
his
own
mates
the
more
sufficient
did
this
isolated
communal
life
of
wolfpits
become
it
was
the
most
peaceful
and
natural
that
he
had
ever
lived
and
he
grew
to
love
it
for
its
regularity
and
calm
the
only
force
that
tended
to
drag
him
out
of
this
centripetal
existence
was
susie
whatever
her
father
might
think
of
abner
and
however
little
he
might
come
to
the
pound
house
she
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
a
man
to
whom
she
had
taken
such
a
passionate
fancy
of
all
those
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
in
mainstone
abner
had
pleased
her
best
being
more
completely
her
opposite
than
any
of
the
others
his
fairness
his
strength
and
a
certain
innocence
in
his
composition
had
made
her
choose
him
for
her
own
and
even
though
he
found
the
relation
exacting
and
occasionally
inconvenient
abner
was
still
under
the
spell
of
her
physical
attraction
indeed
there
seemed
to
be
no
fear
of
this
being
exhausted
for
their
meetings
were
necessarily
rarer
and
therefore
more
enthralling
in
the
regularity
of
his
new
life
at
wolfpits
lurked
the
obvious
disadvantage
that
abner
s
visits
to
susie
became
conspicuous
mary
knew
better
than
to
question
him
on
his
as
well
as
the
tact
which
she
had
learned
in
her
experience
of
george
forbade
her
to
do
when
abner
returned
late
at
night
from
these
assignations
she
would
look
at
him
queerly
and
a
silence
and
restraint
out
of
which
she
could
not
school
herself
made
it
evident
that
she
resented
the
mystery
he
wished
indeed
that
she
would
ask
him
where
he
had
been
for
then
he
would
have
been
able
to
put
her
off
with
some
deliberate
lie
which
she
could
believe
or
reject
as
she
pleased
anything
he
felt
was
better
than
this
uncomfortable
chill
this
shy
curiosity
of
gaze
this
silence
it
was
a
condition
of
affairs
that
he
could
not
stand
and
made
him
anxious
beyond
all
considerations
of
prudence
to
blurt
out
his
secret
it
dissolve
the
grudging
air
of
mystery
with
which
she
received
him
one
night
when
he
had
come
home
late
and
could
stand
her
silence
no
longer
he
said
suddenly
where
d
you
reckon
i
ve
been
i
don
t
know
she
said
i
don
t
want
to
he
laughed
and
she
made
a
slight
gesture
of
annoyance
i
never
met
a
woman
yet
who
didn
t
want
to
know
where
a
man
had
been
he
said
she
turned
her
back
on
him
will
you
lock
the
door
and
put
out
the
lamp
she
said
coldly
i
ve
been
to
the
pound
house
he
volunteered
watching
her
all
the
time
i
should
have
thought
you
d
had
enough
of
the
pound
house
she
was
tempted
to
reply
bitterly
to
see
susie
hind
he
continued
yes
so
now
you
know
he
wished
perversely
that
she
would
turn
on
him
and
tell
him
what
she
thought
of
him
it
would
have
cleared
the
air
instead
of
this
she
spoke
calmly
and
almost
scornfully
why
did
you
want
to
tell
me
this
because
a
woman
s
always
itching
to
do
you
think
i
didn
t
know
it
already
then
she
repeated
her
first
words
please
lock
the
door
and
put
the
lamp
out
and
left
him
this
made
things
no
better
he
had
wanted
to
justify
himself
or
at
any
rate
to
brazen
the
matter
out
he
wanted
to
pierce
her
armour
of
reserve
to
see
her
as
she
was
whether
she
were
jealous
or
merely
actively
scornful
didn
t
matter
as
long
as
she
showed
herself
to
be
alive
and
tangible
he
wanted
to
feel
the
shock
of
their
two
wills
their
two
persons
clashing
without
this
irritating
veil
in
which
she
hid
herself
intervening
whether
it
were
love
or
hate
he
wanted
to
feel
some
definite
contact
with
her
something
comparable
with
the
moment
when
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
george
s
woman
at
lesswardine
this
she
denied
him
it
was
unreasonable
that
she
should
behave
in
this
way
to
the
man
on
whose
charity
if
he
put
it
at
the
bluntest
she
was
now
living
it
seemed
as
if
she
had
made
the
maintenance
of
this
spiritual
remoteness
the
condition
of
her
dependence
on
him
he
felt
vaguely
that
she
wasn
t
playing
the
game
and
explained
her
attitude
to
himself
as
the
result
of
her
unnatural
fear
of
old
mrs
malpas
s
tongue
he
was
tempted
at
times
to
throw
in
his
hand
to
launch
out
again
to
leave
chapel
green
and
let
her
go
her
own
way
he
pretended
to
himself
that
his
promise
to
george
an
obligation
that
went
a
good
deal
deeper
than
friendship
restrained
him
but
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
even
if
he
had
not
undertaken
the
care
of
george
s
wife
he
would
never
have
left
wolfpits
he
only
wished
that
her
pride
or
whatever
it
was
would
let
her
be
reasonable
susie
wasn
t
like
that
with
susie
he
knew
exactly
where
he
was
she
had
even
once
or
twice
shown
herself
jealous
of
his
devotion
to
mary
and
tried
to
read
into
it
an
intimacy
which
was
very
far
removed
from
their
real
state
she
had
seen
mary
in
the
and
in
the
gallery
at
the
assizes
had
recognised
her
beauty
and
the
dignity
which
contrasted
so
deeply
with
her
own
abandon
she
would
ask
abner
questions
about
her
implying
that
mary
must
be
jealous
of
his
visits
to
mainstone
in
this
way
half
convincing
abner
that
it
was
unnatural
for
her
not
to
be
jealous
and
aggravating
his
grievance
i
suppose
she
takes
your
money
and
then
treats
you
like
dirt
she
said
scornfully
and
abner
could
not
be
sure
that
she
hadn
t
described
the
situation
exactly
christmas
came
and
passed
a
meagre
christmas
such
as
their
means
imposed
upon
them
the
morning
was
bright
and
mary
took
the
children
to
church
in
the
evening
mrs
mamble
and
old
drew
joined
them
and
in
their
company
the
bearing
of
mary
curiously
lightened
she
became
young
and
gay
almost
childish
there
was
laughter
in
her
eyes
and
her
cheeks
were
flushed
with
firelight
the
old
labourer
had
brought
with
him
a
bottle
of
cowslip
wine
that
he
had
made
in
the
spring
and
they
sat
together
late
into
the
night
telling
stories
of
forgotten
people
and
distant
counties
about
midnight
the
others
left
them
and
though
her
attitude
sensibly
changed
a
little
of
the
glow
was
left
in
mary
s
face
last
christmas
she
said
musingly
we
all
went
down
to
the
buffalo
in
the
and
me
and
the
abner
also
remembered
he
told
her
of
his
own
christmas
at
hackett
s
cottages
how
john
fellows
had
been
in
hospital
with
his
broken
thigh
and
he
had
been
left
alone
with
alice
and
little
john
mary
leaned
forward
and
listened
to
him
in
the
firelight
with
her
soft
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
was
it
her
you
wrote
that
letter
to
she
asked
the
one
you
wanted
to
post
i
thought
i
could
save
you
the
he
laughed
yes
that
was
how
old
was
she
somewhere
about
the
same
as
you
i
and
two
children
no
only
one
how
long
was
he
i
mean
your
father
in
hospital
pretty
nigh
six
and
you
had
to
keep
the
house
going
of
course
i
had
there
wasn
t
nought
coming
in
except
his
club
and
that
bain
t
nothing
to
speak
six
months
she
stared
into
the
fire
and
there
was
a
long
silence
it
s
funny
isn
t
it
she
said
at
last
without
raising
her
eyes
funny
how
things
turn
out
yes
it
s
a
rum
then
she
began
slowly
to
question
him
about
alice
what
was
she
like
fair
or
dark
how
tall
the
kind
of
dress
she
details
that
he
had
to
search
his
memory
to
answer
she
seemed
to
be
working
out
for
herself
the
obvious
parallel
but
never
looked
at
him
why
did
you
leave
them
she
said
at
last
by
this
time
is
was
no
longer
difficult
to
talk
to
her
he
told
her
continuously
the
story
of
his
last
days
at
halesby
she
listened
eagerly
putting
in
from
time
to
time
a
short
question
for
which
he
could
see
no
reason
he
told
her
of
john
fellows
s
bouts
of
drink
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
set
himself
to
work
through
his
compensation
money
of
the
day
of
dulston
wakes
the
boxing
booth
the
brooch
the
moment
when
he
had
come
blundering
down
into
the
kitchen
at
alice
s
cry
for
help
the
the
blow
with
which
he
had
knocked
his
father
out
he
even
told
her
of
the
sovereigns
that
alice
had
slipped
into
his
pocket
when
he
left
her
that
s
what
i
sent
back
to
her
in
that
letter
he
said
was
that
all
it
was
good
of
he
was
silent
and
she
pressed
him
again
why
didn
t
you
go
before
she
said
why
did
you
stay
on
there
till
that
happened
i
dunno
he
said
i
reckon
i
d
got
to
see
it
through
that
football
business
turned
me
you
wanted
to
go
before
yes
i
was
pretty
well
sick
of
it
any
one
would
have
she
looked
at
him
and
her
eyes
were
now
humble
she
spoke
almost
with
diffidence
abner
she
said
if
ever
you
want
to
go
from
here
for
any
reason
no
matter
what
it
is
promise
me
that
you
ll
tell
me
straight
don
t
you
keep
it
hidden
like
that
feeling
that
the
children
and
me
are
a
drag
on
you
if
you
want
to
go
you
go
don
t
you
think
of
what
you
said
to
george
you
don
t
owe
him
anything
you
don
t
owe
me
anything
at
all
if
ever
you
feel
for
one
minute
you
want
to
go
please
tell
me
straight
i
can
look
after
myself
and
i
shall
understand
that
s
what
i
felt
with
george
promise
me
she
leaned
toward
him
with
clasped
beseeching
hands
i
ll
tell
you
right
enough
he
said
awkwardly
don
t
you
fret
yourself
about
she
sighed
and
pushed
her
hair
back
from
her
forehead
now
i
feel
easier
she
said
how
late
it
is
she
wished
him
and
left
him
but
he
did
not
move
till
the
logs
collapsed
in
the
grate
he
was
thinking
drowsily
of
the
other
christmas
in
halesby
of
the
different
way
in
which
alice
had
approached
him
how
she
had
tried
to
draw
him
nearer
to
her
and
how
he
had
resisted
her
he
thought
of
the
clinging
dependence
of
alice
contrasted
with
the
strength
and
independence
of
this
other
woman
poor
alice
she
had
never
answered
his
letter
or
acknowledged
his
postal
order
but
then
she
was
never
one
for
the
suggestion
of
freedom
the
open
way
of
escape
which
mary
in
her
pride
had
shown
him
made
him
feel
for
a
moment
curious
about
that
other
life
that
had
seemed
so
far
away
if
he
wanted
to
do
so
he
reflected
he
could
throw
up
his
job
at
a
week
s
notice
and
take
a
train
that
would
transport
him
in
half
a
day
back
to
north
bromwich
back
to
the
familiar
sky
to
the
chimney
stacks
the
furnaces
and
the
smell
of
pit
mounds
the
odour
of
and
was
in
his
nostrils
he
saw
the
packed
amphitheatre
of
the
albion
ground
and
the
turf
within
it
he
heard
the
rumour
of
a
football
crowd
the
thud
of
the
ball
the
referee
s
whistle
so
utterly
remote
he
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
before
he
turned
the
key
in
its
wards
he
saw
nothing
but
the
high
blackness
of
the
winter
night
not
even
a
single
star
the
dank
air
chilled
him
it
crept
into
the
lighted
room
it
s
a
rum
go
a
bloody
rum
go
he
said
yawning
with
the
new
year
abner
s
work
on
the
became
more
strenuous
for
much
time
had
been
lost
in
the
ten
days
of
snow
that
fell
about
the
time
of
bastard
s
death
and
in
the
violent
floods
that
followed
on
the
thaw
a
mild
january
did
little
to
dry
the
sodden
workings
and
the
task
of
shovelling
earth
was
heavier
to
abner
than
his
old
labours
in
mawne
pit
his
mate
munn
who
lodged
miserably
in
a
leaky
labourer
s
cottage
on
the
at
mainstone
was
taken
ill
with
bronchitis
and
abner
worked
alone
up
to
his
ankles
in
reddish
clay
he
toiled
his
hands
were
rufous
and
his
trousers
caked
with
it
the
burden
of
the
wet
earth
weighed
on
him
it
was
like
a
sullen
enemy
that
made
his
feet
leaden
and
strained
against
the
muscles
of
his
arms
all
the
labourers
felt
it
their
speech
which
had
been
gay
and
became
dogged
and
irritable
nor
were
they
the
only
folk
who
suffered
in
every
farm
of
the
sodden
wolfpits
valley
men
were
making
the
same
struggle
under
the
raw
and
steely
sky
brimming
dykes
that
drained
the
meadows
shone
cold
beside
the
black
hedgerows
the
folly
brook
a
brown
torrent
dammed
with
broken
branches
that
gathered
leaves
and
creamy
foam
filled
the
whole
valley
with
melancholy
roaring
waterfowl
snipe
and
mallard
and
even
herons
moved
upward
to
the
sodden
springs
it
was
a
sad
season
in
which
the
solitary
workers
on
the
farms
seen
at
evening
in
the
fields
looked
as
if
they
were
stuck
fast
in
mires
from
which
they
could
not
escape
so
slowly
they
moved
so
huddled
and
pitiful
they
seemed
even
on
the
drive
at
wolfpits
where
the
gravel
was
reasonably
dry
it
was
painful
to
see
the
bowed
figure
of
old
drew
returning
at
night
his
boots
so
caked
with
mud
that
he
could
scarcely
drag
himself
along
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
man
found
consolation
in
the
sweet
fiery
spirits
that
he
distilled
he
sang
so
loudly
at
night
that
mrs
mamble
would
come
in
and
sit
with
mary
and
abner
rather
than
listen
to
his
high
cracked
voice
toward
the
end
of
january
the
vicar
of
the
parish
awoke
to
the
fact
that
george
malpas
was
in
prison
and
his
wife
presumably
destitute
between
his
vicarage
and
wolfpits
lay
the
vast
bulk
of
castel
ditches
so
that
he
rarely
visited
the
valley
in
winter
george
malpas
too
was
a
member
of
a
dissenting
family
his
mother
being
known
as
a
fanatic
methodist
but
the
condovers
in
so
far
as
they
had
ever
professed
religion
were
church
people
morgan
and
gladys
had
both
been
baptized
in
the
parish
church
and
since
scandal
informed
him
that
old
mrs
malpas
like
the
dissenter
that
she
was
had
abandoned
her
son
s
family
the
vicar
sent
the
parish
relieving
officer
on
a
special
visit
to
wolfpits
to
see
if
mary
were
starving
it
pained
and
astonished
the
vicar
to
learn
that
she
was
doing
nothing
of
the
sort
she
was
not
even
humble
as
a
woman
in
her
degrading
position
should
be
the
relieving
officer
who
had
made
his
long
journey
to
wolfpits
for
nothing
reported
that
she
was
not
in
need
of
relief
and
for
the
most
shameful
of
reasons
there
was
a
lodger
a
young
man
employed
on
the
and
known
to
the
police
as
a
desperate
character
who
appeared
to
be
filling
the
absent
husband
s
place
malpas
s
wife
had
not
even
made
any
decent
attempt
to
conceal
this
state
of
affairs
she
had
confessed
brazenly
that
she
was
living
on
this
young
man
s
earnings
to
help
her
in
any
way
would
merely
be
putting
a
premium
on
immorality
the
vicar
nodded
his
head
gravely
such
cases
were
all
too
frequent
in
rural
districts
and
yet
it
was
a
relief
to
feel
that
his
principles
freed
him
from
any
further
responsibility
he
mentioned
the
matter
with
satisfaction
to
his
wife
at
supper
on
sunday
at
this
meal
his
weekly
labours
being
ended
he
always
felt
that
he
could
speak
more
lightly
of
parish
matters
the
vicar
s
wife
was
shocked
i
always
thought
her
such
a
superior
young
woman
dear
do
have
some
more
beef
she
said
the
idea
of
the
superior
and
desirable
young
woman
whom
she
remembered
as
the
mother
of
those
two
sweet
children
living
in
open
sin
obsessed
her
it
was
a
terrible
and
fascinating
picture
and
since
the
usual
supply
of
gossip
failed
at
the
next
lesswardine
working
party
she
dilated
in
hushed
tones
on
the
latest
enormity
one
feels
a
thing
like
that
in
one
s
own
parish
she
said
speaking
as
usual
as
if
she
and
not
the
vicar
were
the
incumbent
but
i
am
afraid
nothing
can
be
somebody
made
a
suggestion
the
sister
of
the
vicar
of
mr
cyril
name
was
a
curious
shortly
to
be
married
to
a
young
engineer
and
the
vicar
would
consequently
be
in
need
of
a
housekeeper
what
a
providential
escape
it
would
be
if
this
young
woman
could
find
a
home
in
mr
malpas
s
vicarage
if
only
mr
malpas
would
overlook
this
terrible
state
of
affairs
and
take
her
they
added
the
only
difficulty
that
i
see
said
the
vicar
s
wife
is
that
of
the
but
the
matron
at
the
workhouse
is
so
motherly
and
such
a
religious
woman
poor
little
things
it
would
be
a
blessing
in
mr
malpas
readily
consented
his
sister
celia
to
tell
the
truth
had
not
been
very
successful
as
a
housekeeper
her
individuality
had
been
too
to
say
that
position
and
a
woman
who
had
her
reputation
to
regain
would
surely
be
anxious
to
please
the
new
arrangement
was
proposed
to
mary
the
vicar
s
wife
put
the
matter
delicately
for
she
prided
herself
on
her
tact
more
than
ever
she
was
impressed
with
the
young
woman
s
superiority
and
the
sweetness
of
the
children
then
i
shall
tell
mr
malpas
that
you
will
be
glad
to
come
mrs
er
malpas
i
must
talk
it
over
with
mr
fellows
said
mary
mr
fellows
my
oh
yes
i
see
said
the
vicar
s
wife
that
evening
abner
came
in
tired
from
a
day
s
work
in
the
rain
his
clothes
were
soaked
they
steamed
as
he
stood
before
the
fire
and
filled
the
room
with
a
harsh
odour
of
wool
and
sweat
she
told
him
calmly
of
her
visitor
and
of
the
proposal
that
she
had
made
she
did
not
say
a
word
of
her
own
inclinations
what
about
the
kids
he
asked
i
couldn
t
take
them
with
me
they
would
go
to
the
to
hell
with
the
work
us
said
abner
not
likely
what
do
they
take
you
for
mary
smiled
she
told
him
what
they
took
her
for
abner
was
seized
with
rage
they
re
a
dirty
lot
of
swine
that
s
what
they
are
he
said
by
god
i
d
like
to
tell
em
of
it
it
s
natural
she
said
it
looks
like
and
what
the
hell
does
it
matter
what
it
looks
like
so
long
as
there
bain
t
nothing
wrong
old
george
knows
it
s
all
right
and
he
m
the
only
one
as
she
did
not
answer
an
what
s
the
difference
you
being
here
with
me
or
living
alone
with
that
there
parson
he
s
a
clergyman
she
said
a
clergyman
is
he
abner
cried
a
clergyman
i
like
that
it
pleased
her
in
her
heart
to
see
him
so
moved
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
she
said
quietly
if
you
want
to
go
like
you
did
before
when
you
were
at
home
this
is
your
he
stood
scowling
in
front
of
the
fire
he
couldn
t
make
her
out
when
he
left
the
court
at
shrewsbury
he
had
set
himself
to
a
deliberate
line
of
conduct
and
determined
to
go
through
with
it
when
they
had
spoken
of
it
before
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
he
and
mary
were
agreed
on
it
and
that
nothing
could
change
it
until
george
s
return
even
now
he
couldn
t
bring
himself
to
believe
that
she
wanted
to
make
a
change
he
knew
her
quiet
passion
for
the
children
too
well
to
think
that
anything
could
tempt
her
to
abandon
them
to
the
care
of
strangers
also
he
knew
her
pride
he
believed
that
her
pride
and
nothing
else
was
keeping
her
from
telling
him
exactly
what
she
felt
it
was
useless
for
her
to
pretend
to
him
that
she
had
no
feelings
it
struck
him
that
she
was
not
playing
the
game
when
a
man
and
woman
were
placed
in
their
position
anything
but
the
most
complete
confidence
in
each
other
was
unfair
he
would
force
her
to
say
what
she
thought
even
if
it
humbled
her
he
would
force
her
to
speak
it
s
naught
to
do
with
me
he
said
if
you
want
to
go
you
go
and
that
s
all
that
she
was
silent
for
a
long
time
if
you
want
to
go
you
go
he
repeated
at
last
she
spoke
very
quietly
i
don
t
want
to
go
she
said
a
feeling
of
joy
swept
over
him
a
curious
almost
physical
exultation
he
had
brutally
broken
through
the
veil
in
which
she
hid
herself
he
had
seen
herself
at
last
now
with
the
blood
tingling
in
his
fingers
he
would
assert
himself
triumphantly
as
the
man
by
whose
labour
she
lived
she
could
despise
him
no
longer
he
wanted
to
tell
her
so
to
make
himself
strong
before
her
but
when
he
looked
at
her
and
saw
her
humility
he
could
do
nothing
his
words
withered
on
his
lips
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
give
us
a
spot
of
tea
then
he
said
roughly
and
she
turned
from
him
without
another
word
the
seventeenth
chapter
she
stayed
at
wolfpits
the
iron
of
winter
lay
heavy
on
the
land
the
hills
were
leagued
with
winter
to
hem
them
in
and
isolate
them
it
was
as
though
wolfpits
were
besieged
for
many
years
there
had
been
no
such
winter
in
the
powys
march
and
old
men
who
divined
portents
of
weather
from
the
berries
of
holly
and
the
conduct
of
birds
foretold
that
there
was
worse
to
come
by
the
end
of
january
the
cloggers
as
sensitive
to
as
any
feathered
migrants
had
struck
their
tents
in
the
wolfpits
valley
leaving
half
their
harvest
of
alder
ungathered
and
set
off
north
for
lancashire
where
in
a
country
parched
with
fire
and
warmed
with
millions
of
huddled
houses
they
might
finish
the
shaping
of
their
wood
for
market
in
any
case
they
had
stayed
in
the
country
later
than
usual
and
when
old
mrs
malpas
shocked
by
wigan
joe
s
attempts
to
put
life
into
her
husband
bundled
them
out
of
their
lodging
at
the
buffalo
they
had
no
choice
but
to
go
for
the
tenting
that
flapped
miserably
by
the
banks
of
the
folly
brook
was
no
shelter
for
men
in
that
bitter
weather
we
ll
be
back
to
hear
the
cuckoo
lad
said
wigan
joe
you
ll
none
get
rid
of
bad
pennies
like
and
abner
walking
down
the
valley
to
work
heard
no
longer
the
echoing
of
their
axes
nor
the
crack
of
rending
wood
where
the
trim
piles
of
billets
had
stood
covered
in
tarpaulin
he
now
saw
nothing
but
squares
of
withered
grass
and
charred
circles
where
they
had
made
their
fires
among
the
birches
by
the
river
their
departure
made
wolfpits
seem
more
distant
and
desolate
than
ever
little
by
little
the
constriction
of
winter
was
crushing
all
life
out
of
the
valley
only
wolfpits
was
alive
and
it
seemed
a
miracle
that
even
wolfpits
should
live
for
a
few
days
at
the
latter
end
of
february
there
came
a
mockery
of
sunshine
sad
like
the
suns
of
autumn
abner
sang
as
he
walked
down
the
valley
the
labourers
sang
at
their
work
in
a
moment
such
is
the
indomitable
hope
of
living
things
the
birds
broke
their
silence
the
purple
hedges
were
flushed
the
bare
twigs
of
hazel
trembled
as
though
they
would
shake
their
pale
catkins
out
one
could
feel
the
sap
of
life
secretly
stirring
but
on
the
third
day
march
came
in
howling
like
a
lion
with
a
dry
wind
from
the
northwest
sweeping
brown
leaves
along
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
that
bowed
before
it
rattled
dryly
like
dead
bones
once
more
the
floods
arose
and
drowned
the
land
and
there
was
no
more
thought
of
spring
through
all
this
season
the
excavations
under
callow
hill
went
on
and
this
was
fortunate
for
mary
and
her
children
since
abner
s
wages
came
in
steadily
through
many
weeks
when
snow
and
flood
made
it
impossible
for
men
to
work
on
the
farms
sometimes
old
drew
would
be
weatherbound
at
wolfpits
for
two
days
at
a
time
and
this
was
a
misery
to
him
for
he
had
no
life
but
his
work
and
his
employer
knew
better
than
to
pay
him
for
anything
less
than
he
performed
on
these
days
he
would
shut
himself
up
in
his
rooms
leading
the
life
of
a
hibernating
animal
lighting
no
fire
and
cooking
no
food
simply
lying
wrapped
up
in
the
blankets
on
his
bed
with
door
and
windows
closed
against
the
cold
at
night
he
would
drink
himself
warm
with
his
and
keep
mrs
mamble
awake
by
singing
fair
or
foul
the
work
of
the
never
slackened
and
mary
was
kept
busy
scraping
the
caked
mud
from
abner
s
clothes
the
rain
ceased
and
the
floods
fell
there
followed
a
hushed
season
in
which
the
note
of
the
was
heard
sounding
faintly
timorously
the
trees
whispered
together
in
the
night
the
valley
was
silent
and
yet
beneath
the
silence
one
felt
a
secret
battle
of
blind
forces
moment
by
moment
cell
by
cell
the
creatures
of
earth
were
breaking
free
from
the
heavy
lethargy
that
had
sealed
them
even
in
the
dull
members
of
men
the
slow
flame
quickened
the
numb
fibres
stirred
as
yet
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
few
changes
might
be
seen
over
the
fields
flights
of
peewits
wheeled
and
screamed
with
flapping
tumbling
wings
only
the
bloom
of
purple
on
the
hedgerows
flushed
to
a
warmer
brown
only
tassels
of
in
bud
softened
the
stark
outline
of
their
branches
only
on
the
fringe
of
the
woodland
the
green
of
appeared
then
with
a
sudden
fervour
unknown
in
more
temperate
climes
spring
came
the
sloes
were
sprayed
with
light
the
hue
of
hawthorn
twigs
paled
in
the
space
of
a
single
week
the
whole
earth
broke
in
a
green
flame
nor
was
it
only
green
things
that
were
born
white
lambs
appeared
as
by
magic
in
the
fields
seeming
as
little
dependent
on
the
agency
of
men
as
the
white
daisies
at
evening
when
abner
came
home
from
work
they
leapt
into
the
air
and
twisted
their
heads
sideways
in
the
leap
the
valley
was
full
of
tender
bleatings
he
laughed
at
them
striding
homewards
his
mates
laughed
and
whistled
at
their
work
even
the
sad
disfigured
face
of
munn
grew
blandly
childishly
happy
gladys
and
morgan
knew
that
spring
had
they
had
known
of
its
coming
long
before
abner
suspected
it
they
made
great
plans
to
go
out
into
the
fields
with
spider
and
see
the
lambs
at
play
they
cried
when
bedtime
came
for
very
excess
of
life
but
it
ban
t
dark
mam
they
said
coaxing
mary
to
let
them
play
a
little
longer
she
could
not
refuse
them
for
she
herself
loved
to
sit
sewing
in
the
doorway
hearing
their
voices
echoed
from
the
warming
walls
of
the
house
while
the
swallows
darted
to
and
fro
under
the
eaves
above
her
she
would
sit
there
talking
lazily
to
old
drew
who
now
began
to
be
busy
with
his
garden
when
she
inquired
how
his
rheumatism
was
he
would
straighten
his
back
with
a
smile
and
tell
her
that
he
felt
like
a
man
of
thirty
when
rain
came
he
would
stand
on
his
step
gazing
at
the
garden
fondly
as
though
he
expected
to
see
his
seeds
pushing
above
the
soil
during
all
these
days
they
heard
nothing
of
george
the
three
months
of
silence
that
the
law
imposes
on
a
prisoner
in
jail
were
now
over
mick
connor
that
specialist
in
all
the
details
of
a
criminal
s
life
informed
abner
that
when
this
time
was
over
the
convict
was
usually
allowed
the
privilege
of
writing
one
letter
a
month
and
if
his
conduct
were
good
enough
he
might
even
receive
one
visitor
of
his
choice
but
no
letter
came
to
wolfpits
one
day
at
his
work
abner
overheard
a
conversation
between
two
of
his
mates
from
which
he
gathered
that
mrs
malpas
had
made
a
journey
to
shrewsbury
and
seen
her
son
he
s
looking
up
fine
by
all
accounts
said
one
of
them
and
the
old
woman
s
pleased
as
anything
he
hasn
t
sent
for
his
abner
experienced
a
sudden
feeling
of
anger
for
mary
s
sake
he
felt
the
slight
almost
as
much
as
if
it
had
been
pointed
against
himself
but
on
the
way
home
he
decided
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
tell
her
probably
she
imagined
that
a
prisoner
was
shut
off
from
all
communication
with
the
outer
world
for
the
term
of
his
sentence
and
if
this
were
so
it
was
better
that
she
should
remain
in
ignorance
who
would
be
george
s
next
visitor
the
woman
from
lesswardine
a
drowsiness
fell
on
the
valley
a
deep
drowsiness
of
growth
and
heavy
green
cuckoos
began
to
call
at
dawn
even
in
the
heat
of
the
day
they
called
flying
from
hedge
to
hedge
the
monotony
of
their
song
lulled
the
valley
to
sleep
twilights
lengthened
abner
was
now
so
settled
in
his
life
at
wolfpits
that
his
friends
would
come
up
and
see
him
there
sitting
in
the
garden
through
the
evening
talking
to
him
and
playing
with
the
children
munn
who
had
never
yet
shaken
himself
free
from
the
toils
of
his
unhappy
childhood
came
shyly
and
was
in
their
company
particularly
when
mary
joined
them
but
mick
connor
who
had
never
been
shy
in
his
life
and
loved
children
as
most
irishmen
do
made
his
visit
to
wolfpits
almost
a
daily
custom
in
this
happy
languid
season
he
had
no
more
serious
business
in
hand
he
even
viewed
badger
indulgently
badger
might
shoot
as
many
foxes
might
hatch
rear
and
put
down
as
many
young
pheasants
in
the
woods
as
he
more
the
better
for
the
present
mick
was
content
to
take
his
ease
mary
liked
him
she
couldn
t
help
liking
him
for
he
made
her
laugh
and
was
so
kind
to
the
children
morgan
in
particular
looked
forward
to
mick
s
coming
for
his
young
animal
instinct
had
discovered
that
the
poacher
s
pocket
in
the
skirts
of
the
irishman
s
coat
sometimes
contained
bananas
a
fruit
to
which
morgan
would
devote
himself
to
the
degree
of
suffering
mick
could
never
make
gladys
forsake
her
abner
s
knee
for
his
but
morgan
s
stomach
always
got
the
better
of
filial
love
when
his
new
friend
appeared
is
there
aught
in
your
pocket
mis
r
connor
he
would
say
coaxingly
morgan
you
mustn
t
be
rude
mary
would
protest
mayn
t
i
ask
him
mam
mick
would
wink
at
him
and
how
would
i
know
what
s
in
there
come
and
be
looking
for
he
would
take
morgan
up
on
his
knee
and
then
half
awed
by
warnings
that
something
might
bite
him
the
child
would
slip
his
hand
into
the
deep
pocket
and
pull
out
the
fruit
with
a
chuckle
of
delight
mr
connor
spoils
you
and
that
s
the
truth
mary
would
reply
sometimes
the
pocket
was
empty
and
at
such
times
mick
was
put
to
an
elaborate
explanation
of
what
had
happened
embracing
the
origin
of
this
mysterious
fruit
wait
an
i
ll
tell
you
he
said
last
night
when
i
looked
in
my
box
where
the
leprechaun
puts
it
there
was
a
beautiful
lot
of
fruit
there
oranges
and
grapes
and
apples
and
the
rest
more
n
i
could
lift
in
the
both
of
my
not
any
bananas
morgan
asked
anxiously
bananners
ah
don
t
be
talkun
three
beautiful
bunches
of
them
fresh
from
the
tree
with
the
juice
runnun
out
of
the
stalks
of
them
they
was
that
ripe
so
says
i
i
ll
put
them
all
in
my
pocket
i
will
and
go
out
and
ate
one
or
two
of
his
voice
sank
to
an
awed
confidential
level
so
when
i
was
after
leaving
mainstone
and
got
out
on
the
turnpike
i
walked
quick
along
the
cemetery
wall
for
you
never
know
what
you
mightn
t
see
in
a
place
the
likes
of
that
an
then
i
heard
a
sound
of
wheels
behind
me
and
the
hoofs
of
horses
trottun
up
to
the
corner
an
i
thought
who
would
be
driving
after
me
at
that
time
of
night
an
not
a
star
showun
houly
saints
i
thought
what
can
it
be
i
know
what
it
was
said
morgan
grimly
for
he
had
heard
of
this
adventure
before
is
that
a
fact
said
mick
with
impressive
surprise
it
was
the
mam
said
morgan
in
a
whisper
and
so
it
was
replied
mick
slapping
his
thigh
the
on
the
box
of
ut
two
men
in
long
black
coats
with
the
faces
blacked
on
them
and
hair
like
our
ass
when
they
see
me
they
pulls
up
sudden
and
these
black
pair
jumps
off
of
the
box
and
takes
hould
on
me
and
puts
their
hands
in
my
pocket
the
way
my
shirt
stuck
to
my
back
for
fright
and
stole
all
the
fruit
on
me
and
drove
off
without
a
the
sensation
of
this
adventure
was
almost
enough
to
compensate
morgan
for
the
loss
of
his
fruit
it
was
morgan
s
favourite
story
but
gladys
was
abner
s
girl
and
would
rather
sit
on
his
knee
listening
with
wide
eyes
on
abner
s
knee
she
felt
quite
safe
sometimes
abner
mick
and
the
two
children
would
leave
mary
busy
with
her
sewing
and
walk
down
together
to
the
bridge
over
the
folly
brook
or
to
the
meadows
where
thickets
of
hazel
and
shy
companies
of
birches
stood
along
the
stream
mick
always
carried
a
catapult
with
him
ever
since
his
boyhood
he
had
been
a
deadly
shot
with
this
weapon
and
could
knock
the
head
off
of
a
wran
as
he
put
it
at
a
range
of
thirty
yards
he
made
morgan
a
catapult
with
which
the
child
blackened
his
and
carried
in
his
pocket
small
round
pebbles
that
he
picked
from
the
bed
of
the
stream
now
shrunken
to
a
thread
of
water
although
he
could
never
resist
killing
birds
when
he
had
the
chance
mick
loved
every
feather
on
them
and
indeed
he
knew
them
well
their
nestings
their
flight
their
song
and
their
quick
cries
of
alarm
he
showed
morgan
all
the
birds
of
that
mountain
valley
the
tree
pipits
that
sprang
upward
like
a
stone
tossed
into
the
air
and
then
planed
downwards
with
spread
tails
twittering
like
mechanical
toys
the
sandpipers
that
called
plaintively
from
spits
of
sand
the
black
dippers
that
fled
upstream
under
the
arching
alders
the
that
made
in
echoing
stony
combes
a
noise
that
he
imitated
by
tapping
two
pebbles
together
the
redstarts
that
fluttered
their
bright
tails
near
the
walls
in
whose
crevices
they
nested
and
they
would
stand
still
this
little
group
of
four
listening
to
the
warble
of
the
blackcap
safely
hidden
in
impenetrable
thickets
or
lift
their
heads
under
the
high
shade
of
larches
to
hear
the
hissing
note
of
the
coming
home
tired
in
the
twilight
the
children
s
hands
hot
with
the
green
smell
of
that
they
had
gathered
in
the
meadows
while
the
light
faded
the
two
men
would
smoke
their
pipes
on
the
bridge
where
the
big
black
trout
that
inhabited
the
pool
hung
gorged
with
mayfly
and
held
the
stream
with
faintly
quivering
fins
mick
loved
to
watch
them
quietly
telling
in
his
slow
hypnotic
tones
of
the
great
cannibal
trout
of
the
barrow
so
strong
that
they
could
pull
a
child
into
the
water
after
them
when
they
turned
to
go
home
morgan
would
beg
to
shoot
at
the
trout
with
his
catapult
he
never
hit
one
but
when
the
stone
reached
the
water
they
could
see
the
dark
streaks
of
the
fishes
vanishing
under
the
shadows
of
the
bridge
often
mick
would
talk
of
great
days
in
ireland
the
days
of
country
and
fairs
and
round
these
events
also
a
legend
arose
when
morgan
was
shooting
with
his
catapult
the
irishman
would
encourage
him
with
the
patter
of
the
man
who
kept
a
shooting
gallery
reeling
off
long
strings
of
words
that
meant
nothing
to
the
child
and
standing
up
with
bright
eyes
and
flushed
cheeks
as
though
the
hum
of
the
fair
were
still
in
his
ears
now
then
walk
up

your

he
told
them
of
the
a
live
aunt
sally
who
stood
up
in
his
tub
with
tangled
hair
and
fierce
beard
warding
off
the
flights
of
sticks
that
were
hurled
at
his
head
and
of
that
great
mystery
the
live
lion
stuffed
with
straw
morgan
drank
it
all
in
eagerly
why
bain
t
there
no
fairs
in
these
parts
he
said
in
a
weak
moment
his
mother
told
him
that
there
were
fairs
in
shropshire
and
above
all
the
great
fair
of
brampton
bryan
held
every
year
in
june
she
told
him
how
her
father
had
taken
her
there
many
years
ago
when
she
was
a
little
girl
and
how
she
had
eaten
the
cakes
which
are
made
on
purpose
for
this
festival
bron
cakes
they
call
them
she
said
the
fact
that
eating
was
added
to
these
other
delights
inflamed
morgan
s
imagination
will
they
have
bron
cakes
this
time
he
asked
of
course
they
will
they
always
have
bron
can
t
we
go
mam
it
s
a
long
way
away
she
told
him
but
granfer
took
granfer
had
a
horse
and
grandma
malpas
has
a
pony
morgan
persisted
some
day
when
you
re
a
big
boy
you
shall
go
said
mary
the
subject
dropped
from
their
conversation
but
not
from
morgan
s
mind
the
child
knew
better
than
to
pester
his
mother
about
it
but
as
the
time
of
the
fair
grew
nearer
he
talked
to
every
one
else
that
he
met
to
mick
to
abner
to
mrs
mamble
and
even
to
old
drew
the
thought
of
bron
fair
obsessed
him
and
even
found
its
way
into
his
dreams
the
week
before
the
event
he
became
so
persistent
and
showed
so
keen
a
disappointment
at
the
thought
of
missing
it
that
abner
began
to
take
him
seriously
why
shouldn
t
we
take
em
along
he
said
to
mary
when
the
children
were
in
bed
it
s
too
far
away
she
said
much
too
it
s
not
that
far
over
the
hills
some
of
our
chaps
is
going
to
walk
you
can
t
drag
children
up
hill
and
down
well
there
s
the
train
from
she
shook
her
head
you
can
t
get
back
the
same
day
she
said
you
could
put
in
the
night
at
redlake
there
s
a
station
she
said
nothing
it
s
a
shame
to
disappoint
them
he
added
her
interest
in
the
children
s
happiness
was
her
weak
point
and
in
the
end
abner
had
his
way
he
settled
with
the
gunner
that
he
should
leave
work
early
on
the
thursday
afternoon
and
return
on
saturday
morning
he
met
mary
and
the
children
on
the
platform
at
llandwlas
in
the
afternoon
morgan
had
never
travelled
in
a
train
before
and
stood
excitedly
at
the
window
next
to
his
mother
gladys
sat
quietly
by
the
side
of
abner
who
carried
the
brown
paper
parcel
in
which
their
clothes
and
provisions
were
packed
he
was
not
quite
comfortable
for
it
seemed
to
him
even
now
that
mary
had
undertaken
the
expedition
under
protest
this
was
unreasonable
for
he
had
enough
money
to
carry
them
through
and
it
was
no
use
going
on
an
expedition
like
this
unless
she
were
determined
to
enjoy
it
but
mary
was
thinking
of
her
last
journey
from
llandwlas
in
the
morning
train
to
shrewsbury
perhaps
she
was
thinking
also
of
george
a
fit
of
put
a
stop
to
morgan
s
enthusiasms
for
a
time
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
they
reached
the
station
of
redlake
a
small
village
which
stands
on
a
little
river
that
is
a
torrent
in
winter
but
in
summer
no
more
than
a
trickle
of
water
from
there
a
road
hung
with
heavy
trees
runs
straight
to
brampton
bryan
three
or
four
miles
away
the
train
was
crowded
and
as
they
approached
redlake
mary
grew
uneasy
for
she
guessed
that
most
of
the
travellers
were
bound
for
the
same
place
and
with
the
same
purpose
and
began
to
wonder
if
they
could
find
a
lodging
in
so
small
a
village
she
whispered
her
fears
to
abner
and
they
hurried
from
the
station
into
the
sloping
street
the
first
inn
that
they
came
to
was
already
full
you
might
get
a
room
at
the
harley
arms
if
you
re
quick
a
flustered
landlord
told
them
they
went
straight
on
abner
walked
too
quickly
for
them
and
mary
almost
had
to
run
dragging
the
children
behind
her
at
the
harley
arms
a
fat
woman
eyed
them
suspiciously
it
s
the
worst
day
of
the
whole
year
she
said
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
do
it
if
you
d
come
in
by
the
next
train
you
wouldn
t
have
found
a
bed
in
the
whole
of
you
can
t
turn
the
children
out
said
abner
the
little
boy
s
been
sick
in
the
morgan
s
face
was
still
patched
yellow
and
white
at
the
corners
of
the
mouth
the
landlady
against
all
her
intentions
softened
poor
little
soul
she
said
she
tied
another
knot
in
the
string
of
the
blue
striped
apron
that
she
wore
as
though
her
hands
must
be
doing
something
to
contribute
to
the
general
atmosphere
of
haste
and
flurry
poor
little
soul
well
now
what
can
i
do
what
with
the
pies
and
one
thing
and
another
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
to
put
the
man
in
the
front
room
along
with
mr
prowse
at
the
back
but
i
must
say
i
don
t
like
disturbing
mr
prowse
the
number
of
fairs
he
s
been
with
me
comes
regular
he
does
you
can
look
for
him
like
the
swallows
still
he
s
a
nice
man
a
very
nice
man
and
if
i
told
him
all
about
it
i
don
t
think
he
d
stand
in
your
way
come
along
my
dear
the
last
words
were
addressed
to
mary
whose
hand
morgan
was
clutching
convulsively
as
though
he
still
felt
the
train
swinging
under
his
feet
they
all
entered
a
room
on
the
left
of
the
doorway
in
it
were
two
long
tables
spread
with
coarse
linen
cloths
of
a
gleaming
whiteness
and
laden
with
a
series
of
boiled
hams
crisped
with
golden
and
gigantic
pies
whose
crusts
were
of
the
same
rich
hue
loaves
of
white
bread
stood
between
them
and
at
the
head
of
each
table
a
leaning
tower
of
plates
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
barrel
of
cider
had
been
propped
upon
two
even
morgan
s
revolted
stomach
could
not
resist
the
inspiration
of
seeing
so
much
food
in
a
hushed
voice
he
asked
mary
what
was
inside
the
pies
inside
of
them
my
love
cooed
the
landlady
there
s
bunny
rabbits
inside
of
them
and
lovely
pieces
of
bacon
in
a
jelly
that
would
stand
by
itself
you
ll
see
what
s
inside
of
them
soon
she
laughed
happily
and
then
tying
another
knot
in
her
explained
to
mary
that
the
rabbit
pies
of
the
harley
arms
were
an
institution
on
the
eve
of
bron
fair
we
used
to
make
as
many
as
thirty
of
them
she
said
but
the
fair
s
not
what
it
was
in
those
days
still
they
must
have
their
pies
they
d
drop
down
dead
if
they
came
into
the
room
and
never
see
them
there
they
are
waiting
ready
for
them
pies
and
ham
and
bread
and
cider
and
they
helps
themselves
we
re
too
busy
to
look
after
them
they
takes
what
they
want
and
pays
the
same
whether
its
much
or
little
that
s
the
custom
you
by
this
time
the
concentration
of
rich
smells
had
overcome
morgan
s
interest
i
want
to
lie
down
mam
he
said
and
mary
stopped
the
landlady
in
a
flood
of
reminiscence
to
inquire
again
about
their
room
before
disaster
came
well
now
she
said
in
a
more
kindly
mysterious
voice
i
ll
tell
you
what
do
i
ll
put
you
in
mr
prowse
s
room
without
asking
him
that
s
the
best
way
if
you
re
there
you
re
there
and
that
s
the
end
of
it
you
can
put
the
little
girl
on
the
sofa
and
the
little
boy
can
sleep
in
between
the
two
of
you
tis
a
fine
bed
a
family
bed
as
the
saying
abner
saw
mary
go
red
he
came
quickly
to
the
rescue
we
re
not
man
and
wife
missus
he
said
what
you
re
not
a
married
couple
that
s
different
altogether
said
the
landlady
her
tone
hardening
this
young
man
only
came
along
with
me
to
help
me
with
the
children
mary
explained
i
ve
kept
this
place
respectable
all
my
life
and
i
don
t
intend
to
start
anything
different
said
the
landlady
severely
i
think
you
d
better
look
somewhere
mary
half
shocked
half
frightened
would
have
taken
the
children
away
at
once
come
along
abner
she
said
but
abner
would
not
be
beaten
look
here
missus
he
said
to
the
landlady
if
we
wasn
t
respectable
we
could
have
took
you
in
and
you
been
none
the
wiser
i
m
here
looking
after
this
young
woman
there
s
nothing
else
between
us
if
there
was
i
should
have
codded
you
we
was
don
t
abner
said
mary
the
landlady
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
this
strange
couple
morgan
began
to
whimper
and
the
sight
of
the
child
s
tiredness
melted
her
heart
you
d
better
come
on
upstairs
she
said
to
mary
and
then
with
a
defiant
glance
at
abner
but
the
young
man
will
have
to
look
out
for
himself
there
s
no
bed
here
i
can
give
him
my
husband
and
the
boys
ll
have
to
sleep
in
the
loft
as
it
is
i
oughtn
t
to
take
you
in
by
rights
and
that
s
the
never
you
mind
me
said
abner
it
won
t
hurt
me
to
sleep
she
took
mary
and
the
children
upstairs
abner
stayed
on
in
the
long
room
alone
listening
to
the
busy
clatter
of
the
house
the
landlord
his
sons
and
a
couple
of
village
girls
who
had
been
brought
in
to
deal
with
the
rush
of
business
went
running
up
and
down
stairs
and
stone
passages
and
in
and
out
of
the
bar
as
quickly
and
apparently
as
aimlessly
as
the
inhabitants
of
a
disturbed
ants
nest
the
sun
dipped
behind
the
mountains
a
train
arrived
from
the
north
then
another
from
the
south
and
each
time
the
street
was
flooded
with
a
crowd
of
excitable
men
knocking
at
door
after
door
in
search
of
lodging
for
the
night
abner
heard
the
landlord
in
the
bar
refusing
them
one
after
another
with
the
second
train
arrived
the
important
mr
prowse
a
tall
lumbering
man
in
cord
breeches
and
black
leggings
covered
with
the
red
dust
of
the
black
mountain
from
the
slopes
of
which
he
came
he
wore
a
close
red
beard
and
spoke
in
a
high
for
part
of
his
mountain
pasturage
was
in
wales
he
had
already
drunk
too
freely
at
the
craven
arms
station
buffet
to
be
much
worried
by
the
idea
of
a
sleeping
companion
what
is
it
you
re
after
this
fair
mr
prowse
asked
the
landlord
draught
horses
said
the
farmer
they
re
very
scarce
down
our
way
and
a
price
that
would
frighten
then
you
and
me
are
going
to
have
a
field
day
mr
prowse
said
a
fat
asthmatical
cardiff
jew
who
had
just
arrived
in
the
doorway
ah
mr
myers
how
is
it
then
said
the
farmer
mr
may
says
he
s
put
you
and
me
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
there
s
a
young
woman
in
the
a
young
woman
growled
myers
what
s
a
young
woman
doing
here
at
this
time
the
more
of
them
the
better
said
the
farmer
with
a
laugh
no
i
ve
got
over
all
that
said
the
jew
shaking
his
head
now
what
are
you
two
gentlemen
taking
with
me
asked
the
landlord
they
all
settled
down
to
talk
about
horses
abner
was
getting
more
and
more
hungry
and
wondering
when
mary
would
come
downstairs
the
sight
of
that
magnificent
array
of
food
whetted
his
appetite
but
he
did
not
want
to
be
the
first
to
begin
he
drew
himself
a
mug
of
cider
from
the
cask
a
dry
half
bitter
product
of
the
hereford
orchards
he
drank
a
pint
of
it
and
the
alcohol
taken
on
an
empty
stomach
made
him
happy
and
confident
he
no
longer
felt
uneasy
that
mary
was
so
long
away
now
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
his
supper
for
prowse
and
myers
came
in
from
the
bar
and
in
a
few
moments
other
men
arrived
they
all
carved
for
themselves
huge
segments
of
pie
and
rich
slices
of
ham
with
knives
that
were
whetted
thin
with
use
abner
took
his
place
among
them
nobody
spoke
to
him
for
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
stranger
in
the
company
many
of
them
had
not
seen
their
friends
for
a
whole
year
since
their
last
meeting
in
the
same
place
twilight
came
and
the
lamps
were
lit
the
buyers
sat
on
talking
and
drinking
at
the
tables
running
with
one
accord
to
door
or
window
when
the
hoofs
of
some
horse
that
had
been
brought
to
the
fair
for
sale
were
heard
trotting
down
the
road
jenkins
wants
to
sell
that
there
cob
rather
than
take
him
to
bron
said
myers
never
buy
a
horse
you
don
t
see
by
daylight
prowse
replied
shaking
his
clay
pipe
to
mark
the
words
i
don
t
said
myers
with
a
wink
i
heard
a
fellow
from
brum
offer
him
forty
and
he
s
a
fool
if
he
don
t
take
there
s
high
prices
going
this
fair
said
prowse
there
s
a
great
scarcity
down
our
way
jenkins
is
a
chap
as
knows
his
and
so
do
i
said
the
jew
so
do
abner
mildly
exalted
walked
out
into
the
moonlit
street
at
the
cottage
doors
and
down
by
the
bridge
little
groups
of
men
in
breeches
and
leggings
stood
talking
together
with
low
voices
from
time
to
time
the
clatter
of
approaching
hoofs
was
heard
and
the
men
stopped
to
listen
the
village
was
full
of
a
strange
sense
of
expectancy
abner
wandered
over
the
bridge
and
a
little
way
upstream
in
the
hush
of
the
night
he
heard
a
girl
laughing
the
sound
disturbed
him
he
thought
suddenly
of
susie
the
excitement
of
drink
and
a
full
stomach
turned
his
thoughts
in
the
direction
of
physical
desire
he
stopped
and
listened
for
the
girl
s
voice
again
and
wondered
what
man
was
with
her
he
walked
back
irritably
into
the
village
an
old
man
was
putting
out
the
oil
lamps
that
gave
a
feeble
light
to
the
street
what
was
he
abner
doing
without
a
woman
when
the
village
was
full
of
them
he
looked
up
at
the
front
room
of
the
inn
where
mary
and
the
children
were
sleeping
it
filled
him
with
an
unreasoning
annoyance
to
think
of
her
sleeping
calmly
there
she
was
treating
him
ridiculously
without
confidence
why
hadn
t
she
come
down
into
the
room
for
supper
as
soon
as
she
had
put
the
children
to
sleep
just
because
the
landlady
had
shocked
her
by
suggesting
that
they
should
sleep
together
he
supposed
and
by
god
it
might
have
put
some
sense
into
her
if
they
had
done
so
he
laughed
he
hadn
t
thought
of
mary
in
that
light
before
but
in
this
curious
state
to
which
the
liquor
the
moonlight
and
that
light
voice
heard
in
the
darkness
had
excited
him
he
felt
that
he
had
been
a
fool
not
to
make
love
to
mary
if
once
he
had
treated
her
that
way
and
she
had
accepted
him
there
would
be
an
end
of
her
airs
and
graces
george
well
george
s
own
life
didn
t
exact
a
high
degree
of
fidelity
from
his
wife
so
like
a
hungry
animal
abner
prowled
beneath
the
inn
windows
the
panes
of
that
which
belonged
to
mary
s
bedroom
shone
blankly
in
the
moon
through
twigs
of
white
jessamine
in
the
bar
mr
prowse
now
very
drunk
was
declaiming
staccato
judgments
on
the
value
of
basic
slag
abner
would
have
joined
them
and
got
drunk
if
he
had
any
money
to
spend
but
the
small
sum
that
he
had
saved
for
the
occasion
would
do
no
more
than
pay
for
their
lodging
and
their
return
fares
to
llandwlas
the
moonlight
seemed
to
cool
the
air
even
the
smell
of
jessamine
grew
fainter
in
the
cold
it
was
no
good
standing
there
any
longer
and
so
he
found
a
sleeping
place
on
some
straw
in
the
loft
above
the
stable
and
settled
down
as
well
as
he
could
listening
to
the
steady
grinding
of
the
horses
jaws
and
the
snatching
noise
that
they
made
as
they
pulled
out
hay
from
the
racks
above
their
mangers
mary
slept
badly
earlier
in
the
evening
when
morgan
and
gladys
had
fallen
asleep
she
had
caught
the
landlady
on
the
stairs
and
begged
that
her
supper
might
be
brought
to
her
in
her
bedroom
there
she
had
devoured
a
solitary
plate
of
the
famous
but
hearing
below
her
the
sound
of
many
men
s
voices
and
still
dreading
to
be
mistaken
for
abner
s
wife
she
had
not
dared
to
go
downstairs
and
find
him
instead
of
thinking
any
more
about
it
she
decided
to
go
to
bed
creeping
gently
under
the
sheets
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
children
but
she
could
not
sleep
the
bedroom
was
immediately
over
the
room
in
which
supper
was
served
and
she
could
not
hear
so
many
voices
buzzing
beneath
her
without
wanting
to
catch
what
they
were
saying
as
the
evening
wore
on
the
house
grew
noisier
it
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
go
to
bed
and
when
at
last
the
noise
ceased
and
she
had
nearly
fallen
asleep
the
moonlight
beating
in
through
the
window
awoke
morgan
he
said
that
he
was
thirsty
and
after
much
groping
she
gave
him
water
from
the
ewer
on
the
thus
awakened
from
the
sleep
that
followed
his
the
excitement
of
his
strange
surroundings
kept
him
going
for
a
couple
of
hours
of
questions
about
the
fair
why
bain
t
abner
up
here
he
said
at
last
this
was
more
than
she
could
explain
if
you
don
t
keep
quiet
my
son
she
said
i
shall
take
you
right
out
and
give
you
to
abner
for
the
night
then
you
ll
cry
to
come
back
to
your
mother
you
re
a
little
nuisance
that
s
what
you
are
she
tucked
him
away
and
huddled
him
against
her
breast
away
from
the
moonlight
and
so
at
length
he
fell
asleep
next
morning
abner
who
had
slept
well
was
early
astir
but
no
earlier
it
seemed
than
the
rest
of
the
world
in
the
yard
below
him
the
owner
of
the
stabled
horses
was
up
and
grooming
them
he
asked
abner
to
give
him
a
hand
and
offered
him
a
shilling
for
his
trouble
i
reckon
they
m
going
to
make
wonnerful
prices
he
said
an
opaline
sky
covered
with
the
faintest
veil
of
mist
promised
a
hot
morning
the
landlord
of
the
harley
arms
had
not
yet
risen
but
the
girls
were
sweeping
the
passage
and
setting
the
table
for
breakfast
in
the
long
room
and
his
wife
was
watching
them
with
sleepy
eyes
while
she
sipped
a
cup
of
tea
abner
joined
her
paid
the
bill
for
the
night
five
shillings
and
took
some
tea
with
bread
and
butter
to
the
door
of
mary
s
room
he
knocked
and
called
to
her
and
she
answered
in
a
voice
that
seemed
alarmed
by
his
nearness
i
bain
t
going
to
eat
you
the
children
he
said
it
s
going
to
be
a
fine
day
how
long
do
you
want
to
keep
us
waiting
she
assured
him
timidly
that
they
wouldn
t
be
long
and
by
nine
they
had
become
part
of
the
stream
of
traffic
flowing
along
the
road
from
redlake
to
brampton
bryan
raising
clouds
of
hot
dust
under
the
heavy
green
of
the
trees
i
don
t
think
the
sun
will
come
through
after
all
said
mary
regretfully
though
the
sight
of
the
horses
sweating
on
the
road
should
have
told
her
that
this
was
fortunate
they
walked
slowly
along
the
edge
of
the
white
highway
mary
anxiously
pulling
in
the
children
to
her
side
when
swift
traps
or
single
horses
southward
bound
came
past
them
it
seemed
to
her
that
so
great
a
collection
of
strong
spirited
animals
which
snorted
and
sniffed
the
air
excited
by
the
presence
of
strangers
of
their
kind
was
dangerous
what
would
happen
to
morgan
and
gladys
if
some
sudden
noise
or
infectious
fear
threw
them
into
a
stampede
all
the
way
along
the
road
she
was
looking
anxiously
ahead
for
the
next
gateway
or
gap
in
the
hedge
planning
ways
of
escape
the
children
loitered
and
it
was
nearly
noon
when
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
brampton
bryan
the
sky
was
still
white
mist
lay
cold
on
the
hills
but
the
plain
grew
suffocating
at
this
point
where
the
traffic
began
to
feel
the
backward
pressure
of
the
congested
village
matters
were
complicated
by
an
actual
constriction
of
the
road
horses
and
traps
were
crowded
together
in
a
block
and
the
men
who
drove
them
looked
serious
and
impatient
there
was
scarcely
room
along
the
side
of
the
road
for
them
to
pass
come
on
said
abner
what
are
you
waiting
for
can
t
we
wait
here
till
they
move
on
said
mary
gathering
the
children
closer
to
her
if
she
could
have
done
so
without
encountering
other
advancing
dangers
she
would
have
turned
back
she
hated
this
narrow
twisting
neck
of
roadway
they
waited
leaning
up
against
an
iron
fence
breathing
the
hot
smell
of
the
horses
other
people
on
foot
passed
them
in
a
steady
stream
among
these
abner
saw
the
farmer
from
the
black
mountain
and
his
friend
the
lethargic
jew
they
appeared
to
be
talking
together
and
thinking
of
nothing
else
but
their
eyes
were
wide
open
and
when
they
saw
a
likely
animal
they
would
stop
and
ask
the
driver
about
prices
or
stoop
and
run
their
hands
along
the
horse
s
slender
legs
they
did
not
notice
abner
with
mary
and
the
children
in
the
hedge
the
block
of
vehicles
moved
on
a
little
and
was
checked
the
movement
slight
as
it
was
infected
the
animals
with
restlessness
they
snorted
and
champed
their
bits
they
danced
with
springing
fetlocks
and
necks
arched
to
the
tightened
reins
mary
pressed
closer
to
the
iron
railings
she
felt
that
she
was
foolish
to
be
scared
and
yet
it
irritated
her
to
see
the
unconcern
of
abner
what
was
his
strength
compared
with
the
violence
of
horses
again
the
block
moved
on
we
can
t
wait
here
all
day
he
said
but
she
only
shook
her
head
a
strange
cart
pulled
up
opposite
to
them
drawn
by
a
spiritless
pony
and
bearing
a
black
tin
plate
with
the
words
hughes
brecon
painted
on
it
in
a
scrawl
of
white
a
gipsy
drove
it
and
behind
on
the
tilted
sat
a
withered
dirty
woman
and
a
girl
of
fifteen
with
a
beautiful
dark
face
and
long
black
hair
which
the
old
woman
was
carefully
and
necessarily
combing
to
the
tail
of
the
cart
a
cowed
and
mangy
mongrel
of
the
greyhound
breed
was
tied
with
a
strand
of
rope
the
eyes
of
the
girl
were
dark
and
wild
as
those
of
an
animal
and
she
stared
insolently
at
abner
attracted
no
doubt
by
the
contrast
of
his
fair
strength
for
some
strange
reason
mary
felt
that
the
girl
s
glance
hurt
her
she
s
smiling
at
you
don
t
look
at
her
abner
she
whispered
how
dirty
she
is
the
whisper
disturbed
the
old
woman
who
ceased
her
hairdressing
wiped
the
comb
on
her
apron
and
smiled
across
at
mary
she
had
no
teeth
but
a
single
yellow
tusk
in
the
middle
of
her
lower
jaw
she
leaned
over
the
edge
of
the
cart
and
held
out
her
hand
toward
them
shall
the
old
woman
tell
your
fortune
my
pretty
dear
she
whined
you
and
your
lovely
children
and
your
husband
a
fine
upstanding
man
my
dear
if
ever
there
was
one
cross
the
old
woman
s
hand
with
a
bit
of
silver
and
she
ll
tell
you
the
future
as
it
s
written
mary
looked
away
the
gipsy
girl
continued
to
stare
at
abner
ah
don
t
you
want
to
know
the
happiness
that
s
coming
the
old
woman
went
on
with
her
hand
outstretched
i
tell
you
that
s
worth
more
to
you
than
a
piece
of
silver
all
that
lays
before
you
my
pretty
dear
mary
clutched
at
abner
s
arm
don
t
look
at
her
she
s
staring
at
you
i
think
we
d
better
go
on
she
whispered
but
a
cart
had
pulled
in
to
the
side
in
front
of
them
and
they
could
not
move
the
old
woman
continued
to
pester
them
with
her
whinings
when
she
saw
that
no
silver
would
cross
her
palm
she
changed
her
tone
she
leaned
further
out
of
her
cart
speaking
now
of
rather
than
good
gratuitously
prophesying
evil
and
a
near
evil
at
that
abner
bandied
words
with
her
and
laughed
but
mary
felt
her
heart
sinking
within
her
from
more
maledictions
they
were
saved
by
a
sudden
forward
movement
of
the
block
the
cart
started
with
a
jerk
which
pulled
the
mongrel
who
had
been
biting
at
fleas
on
its
belly
to
its
feet
the
girl
gave
abner
a
final
dark
smile
the
old
woman
spat
in
mary
s
direction
come
on
said
abner
now
s
your
chance
but
mary
could
not
move
in
some
way
the
encounter
had
destroyed
her
nerve
let
s
wait
till
it
s
clearer
she
pleaded
a
drove
of
mountain
ponies
that
the
gipsies
had
driven
down
to
the
fair
from
some
heathery
upland
of
montgomery
or
clun
followed
them
they
were
small
shaggy
and
very
wild
they
stamped
and
snorted
then
huddled
together
anxiously
in
a
bunch
sniffing
the
air
with
distended
nostrils
the
sense
of
being
herded
together
between
the
hedge
and
the
iron
railings
made
them
tremble
with
fright
and
mary
was
no
less
frightened
than
they
her
anxiety
spread
to
the
children
and
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
left
redlake
morgan
forgot
his
cakes
he
began
to
whimper
they
re
all
right
said
abner
don
t
you
take
no
notice
of
a
little
black
stallion
the
last
of
the
herd
suddenly
took
fright
he
made
a
dash
for
the
hedge
on
the
opposite
side
but
the
blackthorn
was
too
high
for
him
and
he
stood
quivering
up
the
bank
a
heavy
loutish
man
of
atwell
s
build
who
seemed
a
giant
beside
the
little
animal
climbed
up
and
took
hold
of
it
by
the
ear
it
gave
a
sudden
convulsive
movement
and
in
a
moment
the
man
and
the
horse
were
fighting
together
the
animal
pulled
him
to
the
ground
and
for
a
moment
they
struggled
in
the
dust
then
another
man
sat
on
its
head
and
put
a
snitch
on
its
muzzle
they
jumped
aside
and
the
pony
leapt
to
its
feet
it
stood
trembling
and
screamed
with
pain
the
big
man
panting
and
dusty
held
the
rope
of
which
the
snitch
was
made
a
bitter
fight
followed
the
pony
rushing
wildly
from
side
to
side
with
fierce
terrible
screams
the
man
holding
on
grimly
yet
barely
keeping
his
feet
the
other
gipsies
drove
on
the
rest
of
the
herd
and
those
who
came
behind
ran
forward
to
watch
the
duel
with
cries
of
encouragement
now
to
the
man
now
to
the
beast
it
was
a
horrible
sight
at
which
mary
did
not
dare
to
look
though
abner
enjoyed
it
to
and
fro
the
panting
animal
plunged
it
rolled
on
the
ground
leapt
in
the
air
with
fierce
snortings
and
shrill
cries
its
eyes
were
bright
with
rage
at
last
it
stood
stock
still
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
would
not
move
the
man
who
had
sat
on
its
head
approached
it
with
a
halter
still
it
stood
its
ground
trembling
violently
shaken
with
angry
snorts
foaming
it
seemed
that
the
fight
was
over
and
the
wild
spirit
conquered
but
before
he
could
slip
the
halter
on
its
head
the
animal
had
taken
another
violent
leap
abner
saw
its
body
hurling
through
the
air
and
threw
himself
in
front
of
mary
and
the
children
he
went
over
with
the
stallion
on
the
top
of
him
hearing
mary
s
cry
the
iron
railings
were
bent
back
and
mary
was
holding
gladys
in
her
arms
the
shouts
of
the
crowd
rang
in
abner
s
ears
her
s
dead
they
ve
no
business
to
drive
em
on
a
public
road
savage
they
are
poor
little
thing
these
bloody
gipsies
that
chap
did
his
best
two
men
were
now
holding
the
pony
and
the
big
fellow
was
bending
over
mary
and
the
ghastly
face
of
the
child
abner
pushed
him
aside
she
s
all
right
she
s
all
right
said
mary
gladys
was
crying
in
shrill
frightened
gasps
my
leg
mam
oh
my
leg
she
wailed
try
to
move
your
toes
love
a
woman
said
if
she
can
move
her
toes
the
bone
s
not
a
dozen
others
clustered
round
with
various
advice
while
the
men
stood
staring
stupidly
with
pained
eyes
mary
was
hiding
the
child
s
face
in
her
bosom
morgan
clung
crying
to
her
skirts
her
face
was
terribly
set
but
she
soon
recovered
her
presence
of
mind
abner
you
take
morgan
she
said
we
must
find
a
he
lives
just
round
the
corner
ma
am
a
bustling
woman
cried
the
red
ouse
with
the
trees
in
front
of
it
you
can
see
the
let
me
take
her
she
s
too
heavy
for
you
said
abner
and
mary
surrendered
the
child
picking
up
morgan
in
her
own
arms
a
curious
crowd
followed
them
to
the
doctor
s
house
the
eighteenth
chapter
they
found
the
doctor
just
setting
out
on
his
morning
round
his
wife
a
forbidding
woman
plainly
dressed
and
caught
him
in
the
stableyard
and
brought
him
back
into
the
surgery
it
s
the
first
accident
a
little
girl
she
said
did
you
ever
know
the
fair
without
one
he
followed
her
in
fussily
hoping
that
there
was
nothing
to
keep
him
for
he
had
a
long
list
of
country
visits
to
get
through
before
the
broken
heads
should
begin
to
roll
up
in
the
evening
abner
had
laid
the
child
down
on
a
high
couch
covered
with
american
leather
in
the
road
she
had
screamed
her
breath
away
and
now
she
lay
shivering
and
whimpering
softly
almost
quiet
well
what
is
it
said
the
doctor
brusquely
it
s
her
leg
mary
whispered
i
m
afraid
it
s
a
kick
from
a
horse
said
the
doctor
s
wife
from
the
background
let
s
see
mary
s
fingers
fumbled
with
the
tapes
of
the
child
s
drawers
scissors
said
the
doctor
the
sudden
touch
of
steel
made
gladys
cry
out
loud
and
the
first
cry
of
alarm
was
quickly
changed
to
one
of
pain
she
struggled
with
the
pain
and
by
her
movement
increased
it
the
doctor
leaned
his
left
arm
above
her
body
and
held
her
still
mary
clasping
gladys
s
hands
in
hers
put
down
her
face
to
the
child
s
cheek
her
own
tears
were
mingled
with
those
of
her
child
but
she
made
no
sound
abner
stood
helpless
watching
and
behind
him
also
stood
the
doctor
s
wife
gaunt
flat
immobile
in
a
former
state
she
had
been
a
sister
at
the
north
bromwich
infirmary
the
doctor
was
leaning
over
gladys
and
breathing
heavily
through
his
nostrils
his
hands
lean
brown
and
slightly
stained
with
iodine
were
placed
firmly
yet
tenderly
upon
the
pink
and
white
of
the
child
s
thigh
his
fingers
moved
like
tentacles
searching
soothing
the
spastic
muscles
under
the
skin
gladys
gave
a
sudden
frightened
oh
the
fingers
tightened
like
bands
of
steel
all
the
man
s
mind
was
in
his
fingers
his
eyes
gazed
vaguely
out
of
the
window
to
the
cascades
of
fading
laburnum
blossom
in
his
shrubbery
the
billowy
outline
of
lilac
against
the
white
sky
yes
he
said
at
last
separated
epiphysis
lower
end
of
femur
i
shall
want
a
small
liston
splint
and
plenty
of
strapping
i
expect
she
ll
need
a
whiff
of
chloroform
too
if
you
ll
get
it
i
won
t
then
he
addressed
mary
i
think
it
will
be
better
if
the
small
boy
is
out
of
the
room
they
can
look
after
him
in
the
bribed
by
a
sup
of
cocoa
morgan
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
away
from
his
mother
by
the
doctor
s
wife
who
soon
returned
with
the
splint
the
dressings
and
the
anæsthetic
i
ll
just
get
her
under
if
you
ll
see
that
she
doesn
t
move
if
she
kicks
about
there
may
be
a
lot
more
his
wife
took
his
place
and
he
sprinkled
a
few
drops
of
heavy
liquid
on
to
a
wire
mask
covered
with
lint
a
sweetish
odour
mingled
with
that
of
the
lilac
it
seemed
to
abner
that
the
room
had
suddenly
become
oppressively
hot
now
breathe
deeply
smell
it
in
it
s
ever
so
nice
said
the
doctor
gladys
sniffed
then
choked
and
tried
to
push
away
the
mask
with
her
hands
hold
her
fingers
mother
said
the
doctor
mary
closed
her
eyes
and
took
the
child
s
fingers
in
her
own
that
s
better
that
s
he
sprinkled
more
chloroform
on
the
lint
in
another
minute
he
raised
the
mask
gladys
was
now
breathing
heavily
her
face
was
suffused
and
she
puffed
out
her
lips
with
each
breath
the
doctor
handed
over
the
mask
to
his
wife
give
her
a
drop
now
and
then
he
said
and
plenty
of
air
as
well
she
s
just
nicely
he
pushed
back
an
eyelid
with
his
finger
to
see
that
the
pupillary
reflex
was
active
nicely
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
changed
places
with
his
wife
again
he
placed
his
hands
on
the
child
s
thigh
but
now
the
hands
were
no
longer
gentle
agents
of
perception
but
strong
and
ruthless
weapons
his
brown
fingers
grasped
the
limb
firmly
the
room
swam
before
abner
s
eyes
he
went
down
like
a
stone
mary
gave
a
cry
of
alarm
he
s
all
right
said
the
doctor
with
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
these
big
strong
fellows
are
always
the
most
liable
to
faint
over
a
job
like
this
give
me
a
woman
any
day
when
abner
came
to
his
senses
the
limb
was
set
a
long
splint
with
a
serrated
lower
end
had
been
strapped
to
the
child
s
body
from
armpit
to
heel
her
face
was
still
flushed
but
she
breathed
as
softly
as
though
she
were
lying
in
a
natural
sleep
the
doctor
was
washing
his
hands
and
preparing
to
set
out
again
he
offered
abner
a
medicine
glass
full
of
cold
water
with
a
dash
of
brandy
in
it
what
s
owing
gaffer
abner
asked
the
doctor
looked
him
up
and
down
a
labourer
he
thought
with
a
wife
and
two
kids
a
young
he
hated
asking
those
people
for
money
in
the
middle
of
a
misfortune
but
he
had
to
live
oh
we
ll
say
five
shillings
he
said
but
don
t
forget
to
send
me
the
splint
back
dr
davies
brampton
bryan
that
will
find
me
abner
gave
him
two
that
were
loose
in
his
pocket
thank
you
he
said
you
must
be
careful
how
you
carry
her
the
bone
s
in
a
nice
position
if
you
don
t
disturb
how
long
will
it
take
doctor
mary
asked
five
or
six
weeks
with
luck
for
an
hour
or
more
they
stayed
in
the
surgery
visited
from
time
to
time
by
the
doctor
s
wife
gladys
awoke
as
from
a
gentle
sleep
the
support
of
the
splint
freed
her
from
the
spasm
of
the
torn
muscles
she
rubbed
her
eyes
and
cried
softly
in
her
mother
s
arms
we
d
best
go
straight
to
the
station
said
abner
so
having
torn
the
unwilling
morgan
from
the
material
attentions
of
the
cook
they
set
off
along
the
hot
road
that
they
had
travelled
earlier
in
the
day
they
walked
slowly
for
they
had
at
least
three
hours
to
spare
before
the
afternoon
train
left
redlake
station
they
reached
their
goal
at
three
o
clock
and
laid
the
child
down
flat
on
a
bench
in
the
waiting
room
while
abner
produced
the
sandwiches
which
he
had
cut
earlier
in
the
morning
at
the
inn
morgan
having
fed
and
cried
a
little
because
his
dinner
did
not
include
specimens
of
the
famous
bron
cakes
fell
asleep
upon
his
mother
s
knees
mary
and
abner
talked
together
in
undertones
for
fear
of
waking
the
children
until
the
entered
the
with
a
swagger
and
threw
up
the
shutter
of
the
peering
at
them
with
official
eyes
through
the
wire
grille
i
reckon
i
d
better
get
the
tickets
said
abner
he
went
to
the
window
asking
for
two
third
singles
and
two
halves
to
llandwlas
the
whipped
the
tickets
out
and
stamped
them
as
smartly
as
though
a
queue
of
a
hundred
trippers
was
waiting
for
him
five
and
four
pence
ha
penny
he
said
abner
felt
for
his
purse
he
knew
that
the
doctor
s
fee
had
only
left
him
a
few
coppers
loose
in
his
pocket
a
panic
seized
him
he
could
not
find
it
he
turned
to
mary
you
got
my
purse
no
i
ve
never
seen
there
was
a
quid
in
it
i
must
have
put
it
in
my
waistcoat
wait
a
moment
gaffer
god
my
watch
is
gone
too
don
t
get
moithered
now
she
urged
but
though
he
searched
everywhere
he
could
not
find
it
he
appealed
again
to
mary
but
she
had
no
money
not
a
single
penny
abner
had
nothing
but
a
handful
of
coppers
left
they
must
have
took
both
of
them
picked
my
pocket
he
said
she
advised
him
to
look
again
but
it
was
useless
while
we
was
standing
up
again
those
railings
he
muttered
talking
to
that
gipsy
woman
it
s
gone
right
enough
not
a
bloody
cent
except
this
he
threw
the
coppers
on
the
sill
of
the
booking
window
had
your
pocket
picked
said
the
with
a
laugh
it
s
not
the
first
time
that
s
happened
at
bron
fair
a
bell
clanged
in
the
signal
box
and
a
porter
peered
at
them
through
the
door
with
a
stupid
rustic
face
can
t
you
let
us
have
a
ticket
on
strap
abner
asked
not
likely
said
the
stationmaster
i
ve
heard
that
tale
the
little
girl
s
had
an
accident
broken
her
leg
mary
pleaded
the
shook
his
head
there
s
not
another
train
she
said
have
we
time
to
try
and
get
some
money
in
the
village
the
porter
gave
a
stupid
laugh
train
s
two
minutes
overdue
now
said
the
blandly
glancing
at
the
clock
on
the
wall
but
what
can
we
do
she
cried
the
train
clanked
in
a
number
of
country
people
in
their
sunday
clothes
coming
from
the
villages
under
the
long
mynd
swarmed
on
to
the
platform
they
came
laughing
into
the
all
tickets
shouted
the
porter
at
the
door
abner
was
still
rummaging
in
his
pockets
when
the
train
went
out
they
were
left
quite
alone
what
can
we
do
mary
repeated
in
a
voice
full
of
trouble
we
ve
got
to
walk
that
s
all
said
abner
but
you
can
t
carry
her
all
that
way
it
s
only
eight
or
nine
miles
over
the
hills
we
can
walk
that
easy
before
dark
if
we
take
our
she
shook
her
head
there
s
morgan
she
said
you
ll
have
to
help
morgan
on
a
it
s
too
much
you
can
t
carry
her
all
that
he
laughed
at
her
and
in
the
end
persuaded
her
by
this
time
morgan
awake
and
refreshed
was
again
clamouring
for
food
in
the
at
redlake
they
bought
him
a
packet
of
and
some
biscuits
now
that
s
got
to
last
you
my
son
mary
told
him
and
for
the
present
he
was
satisfied
they
set
out
slowly
on
their
journey
home
for
a
mile
or
more
the
road
ran
along
the
side
of
the
little
river
but
soon
the
valley
fell
away
beneath
them
a
deep
trough
clogged
with
brushwood
and
the
road
degenerated
into
a
stony
track
it
seemed
that
they
had
now
penetrated
a
country
that
was
untouched
by
the
excitements
of
bron
fair
for
whenever
they
came
near
to
a
farm
and
these
grew
fewer
and
fewer
being
hidden
for
the
most
part
in
folds
of
the
hills
and
lost
in
sheltering
trees
they
found
men
moving
slowly
about
the
fields
or
calling
cattle
to
the
byre
for
the
evening
s
milking
soon
the
distances
of
the
landscape
had
faded
from
them
altogether
they
came
to
an
upland
scarred
with
stony
lanes
where
they
could
see
nothing
on
either
side
of
them
but
thistle
pastures
poor
and
unkindly
huge
fields
where
many
sheep
were
feeding
in
the
mist
morgan
enjoyed
himself
running
up
the
banks
to
a
gap
in
the
broken
wall
and
scaring
them
as
he
stood
there
like
a
phantom
himself
waving
his
arms
at
last
when
it
seemed
that
they
could
climb
no
farther
into
the
clouds
the
road
began
to
fall
abner
was
glad
of
this
for
strong
as
he
was
the
weight
of
gladys
made
more
awkward
by
her
long
splint
was
telling
on
him
the
road
gave
him
no
rest
it
went
on
inflexibly
between
its
walls
of
stone
and
when
his
breath
failed
him
there
was
no
clean
air
with
which
he
might
fill
his
lungs
only
this
thin
clammy
whiteness
they
jolted
down
into
a
valley
where
they
found
a
village
of
stone
houses
so
cold
and
mountainous
in
character
that
it
seemed
to
have
been
scoured
with
snow
above
the
door
of
the
abner
spelt
out
the
word
new
church
said
mary
with
a
sinking
heart
but
newchurch
is
miles
and
miles
away
from
us
i
drove
here
once
with
father
are
you
sure
it
s
the
right
road
it
s
right
by
what
i
heard
at
the
pound
house
when
mick
talked
of
walking
over
to
bron
it
s
right
enough
only
the
hills
make
it
seem
a
little
later
she
asked
him
anxiously
what
the
time
was
don
t
you
know
my
watch
is
gone
he
replied
irritably
by
what
it
was
in
newchurch
i
reckon
we
ve
a
good
four
hour
before
dark
and
then
there
s
a
they
crossed
another
ridge
of
hills
up
the
slope
morgan
said
that
he
was
tired
and
asked
his
mother
to
carry
him
she
took
him
up
in
her
arms
without
a
word
and
dragged
along
behind
abner
he
looked
back
at
her
questioning
for
the
slowness
of
her
pace
impeded
him
she
knew
what
he
was
thinking
i
can
t
go
faster
she
said
trying
to
smile
but
at
the
next
brow
she
had
to
stop
to
fetch
her
breath
putting
morgan
down
on
the
bank
beside
her
under
a
bush
of
green
broom
i
want
to
walk
again
now
mam
he
said
cheerfully
are
we
nearly
there
he
had
pestered
her
so
often
with
this
question
that
for
a
moment
her
strained
temper
gave
way
don
t
worry
morgan
she
said
sharply
i
ll
tell
you
when
we
re
abner
laughed
and
she
turned
on
him
with
annoyance
she
thought
he
was
laughing
at
her
irritability
but
found
that
his
eyes
were
kindly
lucky
for
them
they
don
t
know
he
said
shaming
her
with
a
smile
she
tried
to
cover
her
annoyance
by
asking
if
they
were
anywhere
near
the
top
of
the
hills
he
knew
no
more
than
she
did
certainly
by
the
time
that
they
had
rested
and
moved
on
again
the
fog
had
thickened
the
stone
walls
and
the
clumps
of
hawthorn
and
furze
with
which
the
fields
were
scattered
looked
misty
wild
gigantic
time
we
quickened
up
a
bit
he
said
how
can
you
be
sure
it
s
the
right
road
because
there
bain
t
no
other
missus
he
replied
up
you
come
my
pretty
and
he
hoisted
gladys
into
his
arms
again
they
could
no
longer
guess
at
the
time
of
day
mary
supposed
that
it
was
now
getting
on
for
six
o
clock
but
the
sky
that
drooped
upon
them
was
of
a
uniform
milky
whiteness
and
they
could
not
guess
the
level
of
the
sun
the
air
indeed
grew
colder
but
that
was
a
relief
in
itself
after
the
oppression
of
the
valleys
they
walked
on
maybe
for
another
hour
mary
s
arms
ached
with
the
burden
of
morgan
who
told
her
from
time
to
time
that
his
legs
hurt
him
or
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
and
vexed
her
to
the
point
of
anger
with
his
cry
of
are
we
nearly
there
she
herself
was
utterly
fagged
and
hungry
her
anxiety
for
gladys
had
made
it
impossible
for
her
even
to
think
of
food
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
day
now
her
stomach
ached
with
emptiness
and
the
cold
moist
air
that
she
drew
into
her
labouring
lungs
did
nothing
to
quench
the
drought
in
her
throat
morgan
suddenly
began
to
whine
for
a
drink
of
water
the
sweets
had
made
him
thirsty
they
don
t
lay
on
the
water
up
here
my
son
said
abner
cheerfully
but
i
some
morgan
insisted
tea
he
added
as
a
slight
concession
mary
quietened
him
as
well
as
she
could
with
promises
they
had
not
passed
a
farm
or
a
shepherd
s
cabin
for
miles
she
could
see
no
hope
of
any
building
ahead
short
of
the
wolfpits
valley
not
even
as
much
as
would
shelter
them
for
the
night
if
they
lost
their
way
or
if
the
strength
of
the
weakest
failed
they
were
wandering
on
and
on
blindly
as
it
seemed
into
a
desert
of
high
poor
pastures
now
they
no
longer
saw
large
flocks
of
sheep
those
that
they
startled
were
solitary
creatures
that
sprang
up
in
alarm
from
the
wayside
tangles
of
furze
and
brier
horned
mountain
sheep
with
shaggy
fleeces
and
black
faces
she
felt
that
the
light
was
failing
perhaps
the
sun
had
set
surely
it
had
set
for
they
had
walked
endlessly
at
sunset
the
birds
began
their
song
in
the
thickets
about
wolfpits
but
here
there
was
no
shelter
for
birds
only
the
bobbed
their
white
rumps
in
front
of
them
and
the
flew
before
them
in
their
endless
game
of
waiting
and
of
flight
so
tame
that
morgan
ran
to
catch
one
with
his
hands
out
of
the
whiteness
above
them
they
heard
the
lost
bubbling
voices
of
curlews
or
the
harsh
cawing
of
the
carrion
crow
she
dragged
on
behind
and
abner
walked
ahead
never
tiring
she
would
have
died
rather
than
have
complained
as
long
as
he
made
no
complaint
a
stone
cottage
rose
up
out
of
the
mist
now
you
shall
have
your
drink
she
cried
encouragingly
to
morgan
the
sight
brightened
her
for
she
was
parched
dry
herself
but
the
cottage
was
only
a
ruin
with
a
broken
gate
on
either
side
of
it
that
had
made
a
walled
enclosure
for
sheep
not
very
long
ago
sheep
had
been
penned
there
for
torn
fleece
had
stuck
to
the
splinters
of
the
gates
and
the
road
was
strewn
with
dry
dung
abner
went
up
to
the
door
to
see
if
by
any
chance
they
were
mistaken
but
the
place
was
quite
deserted
let
s
sit
down
a
bit
he
said
and
lit
his
pipe
she
sat
down
wearily
beside
him
morgan
smelling
round
the
garden
like
a
puppy
came
back
with
a
bunch
of
wallflowers
and
gave
them
to
her
their
scent
was
a
poor
substitute
for
food
but
she
kissed
his
cold
face
i
want
a
drink
of
water
mam
he
said
again
she
looked
desperately
at
abner
wait
till
we
come
on
a
bottle
of
pop
son
he
said
morgan
stared
at
him
with
big
eyes
real
pop
he
asked
you
wait
and
see
said
abner
cheerfully
gladys
who
had
just
begun
to
cry
quietly
in
his
arms
said
that
she
was
cold
we
ll
keep
you
warm
my
pretty
he
said
gathering
her
to
his
breast
are
we
nearly
there
mam
came
the
voice
of
morgan
yes
yes
she
turned
to
abner
it
can
t
be
much
farther
the
time
we
ve
been
he
did
not
answer
up
she
comes
he
said
kissing
gladys
and
lifting
her
gently
your
stache
is
all
over
water
abner
the
child
whispered
they
passed
through
the
second
gate
but
here
a
new
perplexity
faced
them
they
had
come
to
open
moorland
the
road
that
had
hitherto
been
enclosed
by
stone
walls
was
now
no
more
than
outlined
by
bitten
deep
into
the
peaty
soil
mile
upon
mile
of
misty
heather
rolled
away
before
them
then
the
track
faded
altogether
splitting
into
three
narrow
lanes
between
the
masses
of
ling
abner
stopped
and
this
his
first
hesitation
filled
mary
with
dread
which
way
is
it
she
called
he
could
not
answer
we
must
be
somewhere
near
the
top
he
said
at
last
somewhere
on
the
far
side
of
the
ditches
if
it
wasn
t
for
this
stuff
we
could
see
all
but
you
can
t
see
she
said
you
don
t
know
you
don
t
know
any
more
than
i
do
we
re
don
t
you
go
on
so
quickly
he
said
if
we
keep
to
the
middle
we
can
t
be
far
he
pushed
on
a
little
a
hen
grouse
rose
with
a
frightening
flutter
from
under
his
feet
she
went
whirring
away
low
over
the
heather
with
a
harsh
stuttering
cry
where
s
the
cattypult
morgan
abner
cried
and
then
they
found
water
come
along
here
s
the
he
said
the
child
ran
forward
and
knelt
above
a
tiny
cup
of
peat
fringed
with
yellow
stars
of
butterwort
he
lapped
up
the
precious
stuff
eagerly
like
a
dog
so
greedily
that
he
choked
spluttered
and
soused
his
white
lace
collar
mary
wiped
his
face
for
him
go
on
said
abner
and
she
too
stooped
her
aching
back
and
drank
abner
drank
last
having
laid
gladys
down
in
the
yielding
heather
and
scooped
up
water
for
her
in
his
hands
now
they
were
refreshed
almost
joyful
but
mary
could
not
help
looking
anxiously
at
the
hills
in
front
of
them
for
every
moment
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
heather
grew
blacker
and
the
distance
fainter
in
the
mist
a
crest
that
had
once
seemed
unattainable
fell
behind
them
reaching
it
they
had
expected
to
find
themselves
looking
down
into
the
wolfpits
valley
instead
of
this
they
saw
more
broken
walls
and
the
outlines
of
two
huge
trees
it
puzzled
them
it
seemed
that
they
had
come
to
the
edge
of
a
shallow
basin
scooped
in
the
top
of
the
hills
perhaps
they
might
find
a
farm
the
idea
encouraged
them
they
walked
forward
more
quickly
for
here
the
turf
was
smooth
and
the
heather
no
longer
impeded
them
the
trees
came
up
out
of
the
mist
not
only
two
of
them
but
a
whole
avenue
of
beeches
planted
by
the
hands
of
men
stretching
away
before
them
in
the
line
that
they
had
followed
there
must
be
a
house
said
mary
they
wouldn
t
plant
trees
like
this
for
abner
nodded
in
spite
of
his
air
of
gaiety
he
had
been
anxious
and
was
now
relieved
it
was
a
noble
avenue
of
more
than
a
hundred
trees
they
walked
on
midway
between
the
two
lines
of
them
expecting
at
every
moment
to
see
the
shadow
of
the
house
but
the
avenue
ended
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
and
instead
of
a
house
they
saw
nothing
but
two
gateposts
of
stone
ancient
and
weathered
surmounted
by
immense
round
balls
the
man
who
had
built
them
two
hundred
years
before
had
planned
a
stately
approach
to
his
mansion
it
was
easy
to
imagine
the
gates
of
wrought
iron
that
would
have
swung
there
but
of
the
house
that
he
had
dreamed
there
remained
not
as
much
as
a
ghost
there
must
be
a
house
mary
cried
abner
shook
his
head
nothing
could
now
be
seen
but
the
desolate
line
of
the
beech
avenue
stretching
away
behind
them
a
light
wind
rose
on
their
right
driving
the
mist
in
front
of
it
they
seemed
to
hear
the
endless
volumes
of
it
hurrying
by
but
it
was
only
the
long
sighing
of
a
waste
of
heather
this
sound
made
mary
really
aware
of
the
threatening
silence
that
surrounded
them
even
the
presence
of
abner
standing
there
as
stolid
and
unmoved
as
ever
could
not
steady
her
we
can
t
stay
here
she
said
it
s
an
awful
place
it
s
like
a
churchyard
do
let
us
go
she
left
the
desolate
gateposts
with
a
shiver
she
hurried
taxing
her
strength
to
the
last
to
put
them
behind
her
the
wind
rose
the
mist
was
whirled
along
the
slopes
before
them
in
torn
fleeces
she
crossed
another
ridge
and
then
sank
down
in
the
heather
ready
to
cry
herself
the
buffetings
of
the
wind
were
fit
to
break
her
heart
then
a
miracle
happened
a
gust
of
wind
tore
an
opening
in
the
mist
and
the
vision
of
a
heaped
mountainous
landscape
grew
before
their
eyes
southward
the
indented
bow
of
radnor
forest
rose
the
summit
of
black
mixen
hugely
threatening
westward
in
molten
clouds
the
sun
went
down
over
wales
and
fifty
miles
of
thin
air
and
solid
mountain
were
mingled
in
a
fiery
haze
the
sky
was
a
furnace
in
which
the
mountains
melted
away
but
abner
and
mary
had
no
desire
to
see
these
splendours
their
eyes
were
fixed
peering
into
the
trough
of
the
valley
beneath
them
they
saw
green
woods
blue
in
the
evening
light
the
squares
of
barns
the
rich
mosaic
of
fields
the
gleam
of
a
river
and
their
hearts
fell
for
each
was
certain
that
the
valley
beneath
them
was
not
that
of
the
folly
brook
it
was
far
wilder
and
more
strange
they
looked
at
each
other
do
you
know
where
it
is
he
asked
i
can
t
think
unless
it
s
somewhere
near
better
get
down
while
the
light
lasts
there
s
farms
there
he
said
as
he
spoke
the
sun
dipped
down
white
clouds
swept
across
their
window
only
the
memory
of
what
they
had
seen
told
them
that
they
were
not
utterly
lost
they
descended
the
slope
carefully
for
the
grass
was
slippery
and
the
only
tracks
were
scattered
with
stones
abner
could
not
help
her
she
knew
that
he
was
far
too
busy
saving
gladys
from
unnecessary
jars
she
fell
and
morgan
cried
out
that
she
had
hurt
his
arm
she
pulled
her
strength
together
and
tried
to
carry
him
somehow
she
must
struggle
on
for
the
darkness
was
falling
even
with
their
sudden
vision
in
her
mind
she
could
not
now
feel
certain
that
their
direction
was
right
for
a
time
they
followed
a
skirting
the
mountain
but
it
ended
by
turning
upwards
and
they
knew
that
this
could
not
help
them
downward
it
was
difficult
to
go
for
the
fields
were
small
and
irregular
and
the
hedges
often
impassable
yet
downward
somehow
they
must
go
they
beat
through
a
zone
of
these
entanglements
in
wood
and
stone
night
was
falling
fast
since
the
revealing
moment
of
the
last
summit
they
had
sunk
so
deep
that
they
must
now
surely
be
near
the
bottom
of
the
valley
whatever
valley
it
might
be
but
when
the
barrier
of
irregular
fields
lay
behind
them
they
found
themselves
on
open
sloping
ground
again
abner
stalked
on
ahead
without
pausing
she
at
the
end
of
her
tether
called
out
after
him
to
stop
for
a
moment
but
he
did
not
hear
her
his
shape
went
on
into
the
dusk
and
she
knew
that
if
she
did
not
follow
she
must
be
left
behind
suddenly
the
white
air
was
full
of
the
screaming
of
birds
a
shrill
high
sound
that
took
her
back
into
her
childhood
once
with
her
father
she
had
been
taken
to
swansea
on
a
business
trip
and
had
heard
gulls
calling
on
the
gower
cliffs
she
felt
that
she
must
be
dreaming
even
on
a
night
of
storm
no
gulls
could
be
blown
so
far
inland
as
this
and
yet
she
was
sure
that
her
childish
memory
could
not
have
failed
the
cries
that
she
heard
now
were
the
cries
of
gulls
wheeling
and
screaming
in
the
mist
above
her
head
abner
turned
and
called
her
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
of
it
he
called
i
never
heard
such
a
chronic
row
they
re
gulls
she
shouted
her
voice
was
thin
in
the
mist
that
s
where
they
must
have
come
from
off
of
this
water
he
called
and
she
saw
peering
in
front
of
her
a
ghostly
wood
of
pines
and
before
them
a
lake
of
dark
water
fringed
with
reeds
the
wind
swept
across
it
bending
the
reeds
breaking
the
glassy
surface
into
ripples
and
rolling
milky
mist
before
it
the
wind
came
in
gusts
roaring
through
the
trees
with
a
noise
that
was
like
that
of
the
sea
and
the
gulls
screamed
above
them
unseen
as
they
might
have
screamed
over
cliffs
she
stood
with
her
knees
trembling
at
abner
s
side
and
morgan
clutched
her
hand
she
herself
felt
like
a
child
lonely
frightened
they
stood
so
quietly
together
that
some
of
the
birds
swooped
down
on
to
the
water
as
though
driven
by
the
wind
yes
they
re
gulls
she
said
seagulls
we
re
more
than
fifty
miles
away
from
the
sea
i
don
t
she
laughed
nervously
it
came
to
her
suddenly
that
she
could
go
no
farther
her
legs
could
not
make
a
single
step
the
gulls
came
dropping
down
in
twos
and
threes
and
settled
on
the
lake
they
were
smaller
than
those
that
she
remembered
she
thought
they
dropped
down
just
like
pigeons
when
you
scatter
grain
come
on
said
abner
it
s
near
but
she
could
not
move
the
child
tugged
at
her
skirt
she
felt
the
tugging
in
a
dream
we
can
t
stand
staring
here
all
night
abner
was
saying
she
was
aware
of
him
standing
beside
her
in
the
dusk
holding
gladys
to
his
breast
she
saw
the
child
s
white
hands
clasped
about
his
neck
as
quietly
as
if
she
were
asleep
she
heard
him
but
could
not
stir
then
abner
touched
her
upper
arm
and
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
went
through
her
body
like
fire
along
a
fuse
exploding
some
mine
of
passion
that
had
lain
hidden
beneath
her
long
silence
it
burned
her
like
flame
burned
her
and
rent
her
she
trembled
and
turned
on
him
violently
words
of
abuse
came
tumbling
out
of
her
mouth
she
did
not
know
or
care
what
she
was
saying
she
lashed
him
wildly
desperately
it
was
he
who
was
to
blame
for
all
this
trouble
he
who
had
persuaded
her
to
take
the
children
to
bron
and
allowed
her
to
be
insulted
in
the
inn
at
redlake
he
who
had
entangled
them
in
the
crowd
where
gladys
s
leg
was
broken
and
now
he
d
lost
them
and
brought
them
to
a
place
where
they
might
all
die
of
cold
with
his
damned
foolishness
some
devil
inside
her
brain
drove
her
on
delighting
in
the
vile
things
she
said
raking
up
little
grudges
of
the
past
and
throwing
them
in
his
face
revealing
against
her
will
such
petty
miseries
as
her
jealousy
of
susie
hind
it
s
with
her
you
ought
to
be
she
cried
instead
of
troubling
us
that
s
where
you
ought
to
be
you
d
better
go
on
and
leave
us
gladys
and
morgan
and
me
you
don
t
know
any
more
than
i
do
where
we
are
with
the
night
coming
on
we
can
t
go
a
step
farther
neither
me
nor
morgan
poor
little
thing
oh
go
go
i
wish
to
god
i
d
never
set
eyes
on
you
she
threw
herself
down
exhausted
on
the
wet
grass
he
had
stood
up
to
it
utterly
bewildered
he
couldn
t
protest
for
all
her
ravings
were
so
childish
so
disconnected
so
passionately
illogical
he
simply
let
her
go
on
until
she
had
finished
with
him
then
he
disengaged
gladys
s
arms
from
his
neck
and
laid
her
down
gently
you
re
just
about
done
in
he
said
it
s
again
he
placed
his
hand
on
mary
s
arm
hoping
to
soothe
her
and
to
persuade
she
gave
a
strange
shudder
as
though
his
fingers
had
been
ice
and
burst
into
tears
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
he
comforted
her
clumsily
talking
to
her
as
he
would
have
done
to
a
child
until
she
no
longer
shrank
from
him
being
too
weak
to
care
then
she
took
hold
of
his
coat
and
clung
to
him
still
sobbing
her
heart
away
she
was
broken
quite
broken
the
moment
was
terrible
for
abner
he
felt
his
heart
leap
so
wildly
that
he
knew
she
must
be
conscious
of
its
thudding
the
movement
of
her
body
shaken
with
sobs
against
his
own
filled
him
not
with
pity
but
with
exultation
there
was
no
woman
like
her
in
the
world
he
knew
it
hadn
t
he
known
it
long
enough
if
he
told
himself
the
truth
he
must
admit
that
for
months
he
had
never
wanted
any
other
woman
the
desires
that
had
hungered
him
the
night
before
walking
beneath
her
window
and
in
the
moonlit
lane
returned
to
him
in
waves
of
greater
force
he
laughed
to
think
that
being
so
near
to
her
he
should
ever
have
given
a
thought
to
susie
hind
now
she
was
in
his
arms
his
hands
caressed
her
beauty
how
should
he
touch
her
body
without
passion
and
why
surely
she
could
feel
the
blood
beating
in
his
fingers
even
if
she
told
herself
that
he
was
only
trying
to
comfort
her
no
one
could
see
them
there
no
one
except
the
two
children
crying
softly
together
because
they
heard
their
mother
crying
why
shouldn
t
he
gather
her
in
his
arms
overwhelming
her
with
kisses
he
could
see
nothing
but
her
lips
but
when
he
strained
her
to
him
she
stopped
sobbing
and
pushed
him
away
it
was
now
dark
but
for
the
light
of
the
moon
hidden
above
the
mist
and
he
could
only
see
the
paleness
of
her
face
her
ghost
spoke
to
him
i
ve
lost
my
handkerchief
she
said
simply
he
gave
her
his
own
and
she
thanked
him
i
don
t
know
what
i
ve
been
saying
she
whispered
i
think
i
must
have
been
mad
abner
please
forget
he
would
have
helped
her
to
her
feet
but
her
muscles
would
not
respond
to
the
brain
s
message
she
gave
a
weak
laugh
now
she
did
not
mind
being
weak
she
looked
at
him
helplessly
i
can
t
go
another
step
she
said
i
m
sorry
but
i
can
t
perhaps
if
you
left
us
here
you
might
find
if
there
s
a
house
near
i
ll
look
after
these
poor
lambs
we
can
keep
warm
close
no
doubt
she
spoke
wisely
he
left
them
without
a
word
though
gladys
cried
out
with
alarm
to
see
him
going
his
shoulders
loomed
up
in
the
cloud
and
as
he
skirted
the
lake
the
gulls
rose
screaming
from
its
surface
to
be
lost
in
the
sky
abner
continued
his
course
downhill
relieved
of
the
weight
of
gladys
he
now
felt
himself
master
of
his
limbs
the
hedges
and
the
roughness
of
the
road
troubled
him
no
longer
and
when
he
had
been
walking
no
more
than
ten
minutes
he
saw
in
the
growing
brilliance
of
the
moonlight
a
gate
that
gave
on
to
a
metalled
road
he
strained
his
ears
to
listen
for
any
sound
and
heard
at
length
the
noise
of
a
dog
howling
at
the
hidden
moon
that
meant
a
farm
or
at
least
a
shepherd
s
cottage
a
walk
of
ten
minutes
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
brought
him
within
sight
of
a
mass
of
outbuildings
that
made
a
courtyard
in
front
of
a
house
two
long
windows
on
the
right
of
a
central
doorway
were
lighted
he
saw
the
shadows
of
geraniums
in
pots
against
the
blinds
another
dog
came
at
him
out
of
the
darkness
snarling
and
sniffing
him
from
a
distance
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
heard
a
chair
pushed
back
over
the
stone
floor
come
in
come
in
some
one
cried
the
farm
kitchen
was
bright
with
a
heavy
brass
lamp
in
the
centre
of
the
table
and
a
yellow
shade
that
threw
a
mild
radiance
over
the
many
hams
and
sides
of
bacon
that
were
slung
from
the
smoky
ceiling
the
table
was
laid
for
supper
and
a
woman
was
eating
bread
and
cheese
she
stared
at
abner
with
a
piece
of
cheese
stuck
on
the
end
of
her
knife
looking
neither
astonished
nor
frightened
who
is
it
please
and
what
do
you
want
at
this
time
of
night
she
said
without
moving
i
m
sorry
to
put
you
out
ma
am
he
said
me
and
three
others
a
woman
and
two
children
lost
our
way
coming
over
the
hills
from
the
fair
the
little
girl

had
an
accident
and
we
had
to
carry
her
proper
done
in
they
are
and
i
left
them
about
a
mile
away
over
he
pointed
in
the
direction
of
the
hills
well
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
help
you
said
the
woman
who
went
on
eating
the
master
never
has
no
dealings
with
gipsies
what
s
more
he
s
gone
to
the
fair
himself
in
the
trap
and
ban
t
back
abner
explained
to
her
that
he
was
not
a
gipsy
you
can
t
leave
a
woman
an
two
kids
out
there
at
night
he
where
did

she
asked
up
by
a
pool
there
s
a
lot
of
birds
on
it
seagulls
she
oh

s
the
they

year
but
that

minutes

from
here
that
isn
t
there
must
be
a
man
about
the
place
as
can
give
me
a
hand
with
them
said
abner
irritated
by
her
unconcern
all
gone
home
an
hour
ago
she
said
shaking
her
head
there
s
only
me
and
the
master
and
he
s
not
back
at
that
moment
all
the
dogs
began
to
bark
together
she
got
up
and
opened
the
door
and
the
lights
of
a
gig
turned
the
corner
and
dashed
into
the
yard
another
cob
was
tied
to
the
cart
tail
the
woman
ran
to
meet
the
and
a
big
man
threw
the
reins
over
the
horse
s
flanks
and
got
out
of
the
trap
the
dog
yelped
round
him
friendlily
and
he
cursed
it
get
away
he
said
you
d
best
take
out
he
said
to
the
woman
i
m
properly
starved
i
am
what
do
you
think
of
the
new
cob
pound
i
never
knew
such
prices
there
s
a
chap
here
says
he
s
a
woman
and
two
children
lost
up
by
the
pool
she
said
disregarding
his
question
you
d
better
go
and
have
a
word
with
gipsies
he
said
angrily
but
without
waiting
for
her
reply
he
stalked
stiffly
into
the
room
slapping
his
dank
hands
and
blinking
at
the
light
he
stared
at
abner
hallo
he
said
i
know
you
you
m
george
malpas
s
abner
also
recognised
his
host
it
was
mr
williams
of
pentre
higgin
the
farmer
who
had
chosen
himself
foreman
of
the
jury
at
bastard
s
inquest
well
what
s
all
this
i
hear
about
a
woman
and
two
kids
said
the
fanner
threateningly
is
that
malpas
s
wife
abner
told
him
what
had
happened
what
bewildered
him
most
was
to
realise
that
after
all
they
had
hit
the
upper
part
of
their
own
valley
the
pentre
was
indeed
the
farm
on
which
old
drew
worked
and
less
than
five
miles
from
wolfpits
itself
the
farmer
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
cider
and
stood
smacking
his
lips
while
abner
told
his
story
well
this
is
a
pretty
he
said
i
heard
some
talk
of
an
accident
to
a
little
girl
over
he
went
to
the
door
hi
he
shouted
you
d
better
put
to
again
missus
shove
the
new
cob
in
the
stall
and
give
en
some
hay
mind
he
don
t
bite
he
chuckled
to
himself
being
what
people
in
those
parts
call
then
drank
off
another
glass
of
cider
and
motioned
to
abner
to
follow
him
we
d
best
find
badger
to
give
us
a
hand
he
said
he
tied
the
reins
of
the
harnessed
horse
to
a
post
in
the
yard
and
threw
a
blanket
over
its
back
abner
followed
him
silently
out
of
the
yard
and
up
the
road
they
stopped
in
front
of
a
small
cottage
and
williams
knocked
at
the
door
after
some
delay
badger
in
his
opened
it
emitting
a
queer
odour
of
naphthaline
and
the
dried
skins
of
animals
and
birds
put
your
coat
on
bill
said
the
farmer
malpas
s
wife
and
kids
is
up
by
the
pool
got
lost
in
the
in
a
few
moments
as
it
seemed
they
had
found
the
derelicts
by
this
time
mary
protested
she
was
quite
able
to
walk
abner
again
picked
up
gladys
williams
carried
morgan
and
an
easy
path
brought
them
down
to
the
farm
again
badger
walked
beside
abner
but
never
spoke
a
word
now
i
reckon
i
ve
got
to
drive
you
home
said
williams
sourly
you
d
better
jump
up
the
lights
of
the
house
shone
on
mary
s
pale
face
she
did
not
look
at
abner
but
the
woman
of
the
farm
who
appeared
to
be
williams
s
wife
stared
at
her
with
hostile
eyes
bill
the
farmer
called
as
badger
slouched
away
thank
ee
mr
badger
abner
added
but
badger
only
mumbled
something
that
he
could
not
hear
the
sweating
horse
jogged
easily
down
the
lane
to
wolfpits
the
nineteenth
chapter
all
that
night
abner
heard
gladys
crying
softly
and
mary
moving
about
in
the
room
beneath
him
in
the
small
hours
she
knocked
at
his
door
and
begged
him
to
take
morgan
into
his
bed
gladys
was
so
restless
that
the
child
could
not
get
to
sleep
they
spoke
together
with
the
oak
door
between
them
and
a
moment
later
having
knocked
again
she
thrust
a
small
figure
into
the
room
abner
picked
him
up
and
carried
him
into
bed
the
child
nestled
close
to
him
like
a
small
animal
abner
wrapped
him
up
in
his
arms
protectively
as
though
by
steadying
his
muscles
he
could
compel
him
to
settle
down
to
sleep
morgan
s
fingers
lay
gently
on
his
forearm
soft
and
listless
he
was
so
quiet
that
abner
thought
he
had
fallen
asleep
already
in
this
he
was
mistaken
the
change
of
rooms
and
the
adventure
of
finding
a
new
bedfellow
had
completely
wakened
him
and
when
he
had
lain
dead
still
for
a
little
while
morgan
s
fingers
began
to
stroke
abner
s
arm
then
he
fidgeted
and
spoke
in
a
reverent
whisper
abner
are
you
awake
ay
what
is
it
why
is
your
arm
all
hairy
abner
why
because
i
m
grown
mam
s
isn
t
said
morgan
after
a
thoughtful
pause
and
then
i
like
being
then
don
t
you
go
asking
questions
or
i
ll
put
you
out
again
said
abner
after
this
the
child
was
quiet
he
lay
there
burning
in
abner
s
arms
falling
asleep
his
limbs
relaxed
and
then
suddenly
clutching
at
consciousness
twitched
violently
these
movements
were
like
those
of
a
very
young
animal
feeble
and
frightened
and
abner
feeling
them
gathered
the
child
more
closely
in
his
arms
until
he
moved
no
longer
save
with
the
gentle
breathing
of
a
sweet
sleep
abner
had
never
slept
with
a
child
before
it
gave
him
a
queer
almost
physical
sensation
of
comfort
in
addition
to
the
protective
emotions
which
morgan
s
helplessness
aroused
he
had
never
thought
seriously
what
it
would
be
like
to
have
a
child
of
his
own
and
even
now
he
did
not
explain
his
feelings
in
that
way
he
pictured
himself
for
a
moment
in
the
position
of
father
to
a
child
of
susie
hind
s
and
the
prospect
did
not
move
him
the
only
way
in
which
he
could
explain
this
curious
enthralling
tenderness
was
by
the
fact
that
morgan
was
really
part
of
mary
that
the
child
had
come
to
him
straight
from
the
warmth
of
her
arms
carrying
with
him
an
impalpable
essence
of
herself
he
wondered
vaguely
what
he
would
have
felt
like
if
the
child
had
been
not
only
mary
s
but
his
as
well
and
in
the
midst
of
these
tender
and
dangerous
reflections
he
fell
asleep
himself
next
morning
before
returning
to
work
he
left
a
message
with
the
doctor
at
lesswardine
asking
him
to
call
at
wolfpits
all
through
the
day
he
was
restless
and
unhappy
feeling
that
his
proper
place
was
at
wolfpits
lending
mary
a
hand
supporting
her
anxieties
he
consoled
himself
with
the
knowledge
that
mrs
mamble
was
used
to
domestic
troubles
and
would
probably
be
of
more
use
to
mary
than
himself
even
apart
from
the
fact
that
their
finances
would
not
easily
stand
the
strain
of
the
lost
time
he
only
wondered
all
the
time
what
the
doctor
s
report
would
be
and
whether
their
wild
might
have
added
to
the
child
s
injury
he
did
not
mention
anything
of
what
had
happened
to
his
mates
and
the
day
was
therefore
long
and
anxious
it
was
after
when
the
doctor
reached
wolfpits
escorted
by
mrs
mamble
he
soon
got
to
business
and
took
down
the
injured
limb
complimenting
the
brampton
bryan
surgeon
on
the
way
in
which
he
had
done
his
job
the
dislocated
fragments
he
said
had
been
skilfully
opposed
and
the
leg
now
lay
in
a
good
position
gladys
was
young
a
child
s
tissues
were
full
of
vitality
and
the
splint
which
he
put
on
again
need
not
be
worn
for
more
than
three
weeks
he
stayed
a
little
longer
than
he
need
have
done
for
he
had
finished
his
round
and
mary
malpas
was
an
attractive
woman
he
was
a
man
and
not
above
taking
a
kind
of
guarded
pleasure
in
the
intimacy
with
such
charming
creatures
that
his
profession
gave
him
he
asked
her
how
it
had
all
happened
and
mary
told
him
without
hesitation
of
their
train
journey
two
nights
before
of
their
difficulty
of
finding
rooms
at
redlake
and
of
all
that
had
led
up
to
the
accident
he
listened
gravely
giving
no
sign
of
unusual
interest
when
abner
s
name
was
mentioned
but
when
he
drove
away
again
he
chuckled
to
himself
being
intrigued
by
this
new
little
sidelight
on
the
frailty
of
human
nature
and
taking
an
interest
that
was
not
wholly
professional
in
the
idea
of
this
extraordinarily
desirable
woman
finding
consolation
in
the
arms
of
her
lodger
for
that
was
how
he
interpreted
the
case
when
he
got
home
that
evening
he
told
the
story
to
his
wife
little
incidents
of
this
kind
which
came
so
often
into
his
professional
experience
supplied
him
with
a
vicarious
sexual
stimulus
which
his
marital
relations
had
lacked
for
some
years
mrs
hendrie
listening
pursed
her
lips
and
smiled
the
story
was
not
one
for
general
publication
but
she
knew
that
it
would
be
acceptable
to
the
vicar
s
wife
who
had
already
taken
such
a
kindly
if
profitless
interest
in
this
unfortunate
young
woman
in
this
way
the
scandal
of
the
redlake
adventure
began
to
be
whispered
in
that
most
exclusive
circle
of
which
the
at
the
vicarage
was
the
centre
in
this
quarter
indeed
mary
had
been
already
judged
and
damned
as
a
woman
who
preferred
a
life
of
open
sin
to
the
privilege
of
attending
to
the
blameless
physical
needs
of
the
rev
cyril
malpas
the
new
intelligence
did
no
more
than
supply
a
sorrowful
confirmation
of
what
was
already
suspected
it
s
those
two
sweet
children
i
m
thinking
of
said
the
vicar
s
wife
imagine
the
awful
effects
of
surroundings
of
that
kind
in
later
life
the
vicar
only
shook
his
head
after
all
wolfpits
was
so
very
nearly
in
his
neighbour
s
parish
as
to
make
him
scarcely
responsible
it
came
as
a
great
relief
to
abner
to
find
that
gladys
was
none
the
worse
for
her
journey
in
his
arms
in
the
morning
they
pulled
round
the
long
kitchen
settle
into
the
sun
and
in
the
evening
he
carried
this
out
of
doors
so
that
the
child
might
enjoy
the
mellow
light
with
the
others
she
took
a
few
days
to
get
over
the
original
shock
of
the
accident
but
after
that
she
settled
down
into
a
placid
convalescence
fully
aware
of
her
importance
and
treating
not
only
mary
and
mrs
mamble
but
abner
and
mick
connor
as
her
slaves
morgan
was
vaguely
jealous
of
the
attention
that
they
paid
her
but
slep
with
abner
he
said
and
gladys
an
t
has
her
mam
mary
smiled
at
him
now
that
she
knew
that
gladys
s
injury
was
not
so
severe
as
they
had
imagined
she
could
afford
to
smile
sitting
there
in
the
summer
evening
with
her
friends
about
her
it
was
so
quiet
at
wolfpits
not
even
the
birds
were
singing
she
sat
there
and
heard
the
trout
rising
and
plopping
in
the
pool
beneath
the
bridge
a
hundred
yards
away
and
then
the
murmurous
wings
of
a
moth
hovering
in
a
nebula
of
bronze
swooping
to
plunge
its
curled
trumpet
into
the
cups
of
flowers
then
beetles
droned
above
them
and
bats
with
rapid
wings
she
told
abner
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
take
the
settle
into
the
house
while
he
did
so
she
held
gladys
in
her
lap
and
watched
the
man
s
big
shoulders
as
he
moved
almost
without
effort
under
the
weight
of
the
settle
it
reminded
her
of
another
memory
of
him
that
she
knew
she
would
never
forget
a
picture
of
trailing
mists
and
loneliness
and
a
man
walking
before
her
with
a
child
in
his
arms
in
this
state
of
happiness
and
innocence
neither
of
them
suspected
any
mischief
of
tongues
it
is
true
that
abner
had
found
the
presence
of
badger
at
the
pentre
on
the
night
of
the
fair
a
little
sinister
at
first
but
the
fact
that
they
had
chosen
to
descend
into
the
wolfpits
valley
at
the
level
of
the
pool
and
williams
s
farm
was
the
purest
accident
and
mary
who
only
knew
the
keeper
by
name
and
had
never
seen
him
outside
a
court
of
law
thought
nothing
of
it
while
mr
williams
of
the
pentre
never
entered
into
their
calculations
as
a
source
of
evil
but
williams
in
spite
of
his
ready
kindness
in
driving
them
back
to
wolfpits
with
his
tired
horse
had
chuckled
to
find
in
this
incident
a
chance
of
annoying
his
old
enemy
mrs
malpas
of
the
buffalo
in
all
things
he
was
a
gross
and
childish
man
whose
plan
of
life
embraced
only
two
classes
of
acquaintance
enemies
and
friends
and
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
in
scheming
to
annoy
the
former
and
overwhelm
the
latter
with
the
most
naïve
of
kindnesses
as
for
mrs
malpas
not
even
pity
for
her
in
the
affair
of
george
could
induce
him
to
forget
his
quarrel
over
the
hogshead
of
cider
he
knew
very
well
that
her
weak
spot
was
her
own
claim
to
an
unassailable
chapel
morality
and
having
already
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
scoring
her
off
by
sending
her
only
son
on
his
first
stage
to
shrewsbury
as
a
felon
he
could
not
now
resist
the
satisfaction
of
telling
her
that
her
had
been
away
with
the
lodger
while
george
was
in
salop
jail
next
week
at
ludlow
market
he
entertained
the
farmers
ordinary
with
the
story
and
in
the
evening
having
done
a
good
day
s
business
and
drunk
enough
to
make
him
fear
no
man
he
drove
home
chuckling
to
himself
by
way
of
chapel
green
pulling
up
at
the
buffalo
for
a
final
drink
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
visited
the
inn
since
that
unfortunate
quarrel
the
cloggers
who
had
gone
away
in
the
previous
winter
had
found
lodgings
in
a
village
farther
westward
on
their
return
in
the
spring
and
the
buffalo
had
never
emerged
from
the
silence
in
which
they
had
left
it
mrs
malpas
seemed
surprised
that
any
one
should
call
so
late
at
night
the
bar
was
empty
and
she
had
to
light
the
swinging
oil
lamp
for
him
standing
on
a
chair
williams
himself
found
a
match
and
lit
it
for
her
out
of
sheer
fuddled
kindness
it
struck
her
that
he
was
too
kind
by
half
he
drank
his
whisky
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
taproom
smacking
it
on
his
tongue
you
didn
t
go
to
bron
fair
ma
am
he
said
no
mrs
malpas
replied
nor
have
i
these
many
there
s
pretty
things
to
be
seen
there
said
williams
with
a
grin
she
made
no
reply
and
he
advanced
obliquely
from
another
angle
how
s
your
son
getting
on
but
for
the
shame
that
we
all
bear
mr
williams
he
s
out
of
harm
s
yes
it
s
a
good
christian
prison
i
m
told
said
he
laughing
chaplains
and
all
how
s
his
wife
eh
i
don
t
know
said
mrs
malpas
shortly
and
i
don
t
want
to
smart
looking
young
woman
williams
leered
i
know
nothing
about
her
mr
then
i
ll
tell
you
something
ma
am
she
s
been
off
on
the
spree
childer
an
all
to
bron
fair
slept
the
night
at
the
harley
arms
redlake
with
that
lodger
chap
what
do
you
think
of
that
mrs
malpas
blenched
that
s
your
story
mr
williams
but
there
s
no
need
to
believe
you
thanks
be
but
seeing
s
believing
ma
am
said
williams
heavily
and
i
seen
what
is
it
i
owe
you
now
she
gasped
sixpence
and
took
the
money
williams
gave
her
a
cheery
he
wondered
at
the
way
in
which
she
had
taken
his
scandal
a
proper
hard
old
case
an
no
mistake
he
thought
mrs
malpas
forgetful
of
economy
left
the
light
burning
and
went
straight
in
to
her
husband
in
moments
of
stress
even
though
she
despised
him
and
knew
that
he
hardly
understood
her
she
would
use
him
as
a
dummy
on
which
to
vent
her
feelings
dad
dad
she
cried
that
was
mr
williams
of
the
ay
mother
good
land
good
land
williams
he
has
a
tale
of
our
george
s
wife
she
s
going
on
with
that
fellows
as
lodges
with
them
the
one
that
brought
trouble
on
george
they
was
caught
the
two
on
them
at
the
harley
arms
redlake
you
know
the
old
man
who
was
now
awake
mumbled
something
about
that
being
in
the
nature
of
things
when
a
young
woman
was
left
too
long
to
herself
she
picked
up
the
word
furiously
nature
she
cried
it
s
the
nature
of
a
brute
beast
not
the
nature
of
a
christian
woman
it
s
the
bad
blood
in
her
he
let
her
rave
on
in
the
dark
it
was
late
and
now
unlikely
that
any
one
else
would
call
in
at
the
bar
his
head
nodded
while
she
went
on
fuming
half
to
him
and
half
to
herself
she
persuaded
herself
that
her
morality
had
been
offended
though
it
was
really
the
spiteful
satisfaction
of
williams
rather
than
his
news
that
had
wounded
her
for
she
could
not
think
any
worse
of
abner
and
mary
than
she
did
already
when
the
heat
of
her
irritation
against
the
farmer
subsided
its
place
was
taken
by
another
and
more
subtle
flame
she
realised
that
she
had
found
something
to
explain
her
former
unreasonable
hatred
williams
in
trying
to
shame
her
had
put
a
new
weapon
into
her
hands
one
with
which
she
might
positively
injure
abner
and
mary
together
in
george
s
eyes
it
had
been
the
hardest
part
of
her
dealings
with
him
at
the
time
of
the
trial
to
see
the
way
in
which
his
loyalty
to
mary
however
little
that
might
mean
returned
now
that
her
chance
had
come
george
couldn
t
keep
up
this
sentimental
pretence
of
a
belief
in
mary
s
goodness
any
longer
williams
had
justified
her
at
last
she
helped
the
old
man
up
to
bed
blew
out
his
candle
and
left
him
in
the
dark
then
she
went
downstairs
carried
the
lamp
from
the
bar
into
the
parlour
took
out
a
sheet
of
lined
paper
and
a
penholder
carved
out
of
olive
wood
from
the
garden
of
gethsemane
a
letter
to
george
she
wrote
without
haste
in
the
firm
pointed
characters
that
she
had
learnt
as
a
young
girl
carefully
methodically
with
a
perfect
and
cold
precision
from
first
to
last
not
the
least
quaver
of
indecision
stayed
her
pen
but
when
she
held
the
paper
to
the
light
to
read
what
she
had
written
her
hands
trembled
and
the
words
ran
like
fire
across
her
brain
dear
had
hope
this
finds
you
in
perfect
health
as
it
leaves
your
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
have
sad
news
to
tell

all
too

and
the
young
man

at
the
harley

i
tried
to
tell
you

not

trusted
you
only
laughed

it
is
an
open
scandal
and
hard
for
your
poor
father
to
can
do
nothing
to
mend
it
where
you

remember
the
word
of
hebrews

he

i
have
always
told

is
just
as

a
mysterious
when

take

children

not
think
that

it
is
marvellous
in
our
did
you
not
send

me
last
will
tell
you
we
fond
loving
she
sighed
sealed
the
envelope
and
addressed
it
to
then
she
folded
her
spectacles
blew
out
the
light
and
went
upstairs
in
the
dark
to
the
room
where
her
husband
was
already
snoring
she
crept
into
bed
beside
him
and
soon
fell
asleep
in
the
blessed
consciousness
of
innocence
williams
blabbing
to
old
mrs
malpas
in
the
childish
hope
of
irritating
her
was
not
the
only
person
who
found
an
interest
in
spreading
the
story
badger
pulled
into
the
mist
out
of
the
stink
of
his
preservatives
and
walking
sullenly
up
the
slope
toward
the
pool
had
slowly
realised
that
here
was
an
opportunity
of
discrediting
abner
in
the
eyes
of
susie
hind
once
and
for
all
although
the
lovers
meetings
had
of
late
been
fewer
and
secret
while
susie
reminded
from
time
to
time
of
the
keeper
s
jealousy
had
been
clever
enough
to
laugh
him
off
and
to
make
him
feel
ridiculous
badger
had
not
forgotten
his
suspicions
it
was
true
that
he
never
now
saw
abner
at
the
pound
house
and
never
heard
his
name
mentioned
outside
the
tirades
of
mr
hind
who
was
still
anxious
for
his
licence
but
the
rearing
of
his
young
pheasants
was
now
keeping
badger
busy
and
since
he
had
no
time
to
waste
in
watching
he
could
never
be
quite
sure
that
abner
was
not
profiting
by
his
forced
neglect
sometimes
he
would
threaten
susie
as
he
had
done
before
pretending
that
he
knew
more
than
he
did
but
experience
had
taught
her
how
to
deal
with
this
crude
creature
she
treated
his
violence
as
though
it
amused
her
and
he
always
ended
by
accepting
what
she
said
with
certain
dark
reservations
that
only
troubled
him
beneath
the
threshold
of
consciousness
and
set
him
strangely
wondering
at
night
in
the
middle
of
one
of
these
doubting
moods
williams
had
come
knocking
at
his
door
with
abner
beside
him
asking
for
his
help
in
the
search
for
mary
and
next
day
he
and
his
neighbour
had
talked
together
williams
delighted
as
a
child
in
his
discovery
of
such
frailty
in
old
mrs
malpas
s
badger
cared
nothing
one
way
or
the
other
for
mary
s
chastity
he
had
no
particular
grudge
against
mrs
malpas
or
her
son
but
he
quickly
saw
that
in
williams
s
discovery
he
had
hit
on
a
rare
touchstone
for
susie
s
feelings
toward
abner
he
saw
that
he
must
make
use
of
it
before
the
tale
became
common
talk
so
he
cornered
susie
at
the
first
opportunity
that
he
found
and
told
her
as
bluntly
as
was
his
custom
what
had
happened
he
s
enough
that
chap
fellows
he
said
seeing
that
he
told
mr
williams
right
out
that
he
and
george
malpas
s
wife
had
slept
at
the
harley
arms
over
redlake
way
took
the
two
children
with
em
and
all
that
was
the
rum
part
of
it
while
he
spoke
he
watched
susie
with
his
small
keen
eyes
sharpened
by
the
habit
of
observing
wild
game
waiting
for
her
face
to
betray
to
him
exactly
what
she
felt
toward
abner
but
it
was
not
for
nothing
that
susie
had
learnt
the
art
of
being
all
things
to
all
men
badger
s
eyes
were
a
little
too
eager
and
she
was
quick
to
see
it
why
do
you
want
to
tell
me
this
mr
badger
she
said
slowly
he
s
an
old
friend
of
yours
you
don
t
put
me
off
as
easy
as
that
then
you
might
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
she
said
turning
her
back
on
him
if
you
ve
any
other
dirty
stories
to
tell
i
ll
be
obliged
if
you
ll
keep
them
to
he
flushed
darkly
so
that
she
felt
she
was
overdoing
it
she
came
back
to
him
and
stood
talking
of
other
things
her
hand
on
the
table
within
an
inch
of
his
own
i
hope
you
didn
t
take
any
offence
she
said
softly
only
i
don
t
like
to
hear
my
name
coupled
with
a
chap
of
that
badger
swallowed
his
liquor
with
satisfaction
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
artfully
secured
his
point
he
looked
susie
up
and
down
appraising
her
lazily
satisfied
she
had
gained
a
new
value
in
his
eyes
he
held
her
in
talk
and
she
loitered
by
his
table
standing
on
one
leg
in
taking
away
his
glass
she
even
touched
his
hand
they
were
alone
in
the
bar
he
caught
her
and
kissed
her
protesting
as
a
matter
of
form
she
smiled
in
her
heart
she
hated
him
like
poison
her
mind
was
aflame
with
vague
jealousies
for
any
fool
could
see
that
abner
was
worth
two
of
this
man
that
night
she
heard
the
gang
from
the
discussing
the
accident
at
bron
winking
at
each
other
over
the
way
in
which
the
story
had
come
out
they
laughed
without
condemning
to
them
it
seemed
no
more
than
a
good
joke
when
her
father
s
back
was
turned
the
gunner
began
to
pull
her
leg
about
it
but
she
laughed
back
at
him
giving
him
coarseness
for
coarseness
and
went
on
wiping
her
glasses
humming
to
herself
the
refrain
of
a
pantomime
tune
she
heard
herself
singing
her
voice
sounded
toneless
and
unreal
when
she
went
to
bed
she
could
not
sleep
for
fretting
abner
had
not
been
near
her
for
more
than
a
week
and
she
did
not
dare
to
take
the
risk
of
sending
him
a
message
at
his
work
she
knew
that
she
wanted
him
she
was
not
going
to
lose
him
without
a
fight
next
afternoon
she
was
free
and
knowing
that
abner
would
be
safely
at
work
she
dressed
herself
elaborately
in
her
best
clothes
and
a
pair
of
new
shoes
and
set
off
boldly
for
wolfpits
her
hands
trembled
and
her
frock
was
drenched
with
perspiration
as
she
dressed
where
are
you
off
to
got
up
like
that
her
father
called
after
her
can
t
i
dress
as
i
like
dad
she
said
with
a
toss
of
her
head
there
s
tempest
about
you
ll
get
soaked
to
the
skin
he
shouted
she
felt
as
if
she
were
soaked
to
the
skin
already
the
long
spell
of
rainless
weather
had
reached
its
climax
and
the
delaine
frock
that
she
had
chosen
had
been
cut
for
elegance
rather
than
for
comfort
the
sun
went
in
leaving
a
white
and
heavy
sky
the
leaves
of
elm
and
chestnut
drooped
in
the
heat
as
with
the
weight
of
their
own
dust
her
new
shoes
were
too
small
for
her
and
by
the
time
that
she
had
toiled
up
to
the
bridge
over
the
folly
she
wished
that
she
had
not
come
a
yaffle
mocked
her
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
swallows
were
hawking
low
down
over
the
dust
of
the
road
an
awful
oppressive
silence
weighed
on
the
land
she
hesitated
then
turned
painfully
up
the
wolfpits
avenue
but
when
she
had
almost
decided
to
turn
back
the
thunder
broke
above
her
and
big
drops
spattered
the
dust
the
thought
of
the
new
tulle
in
her
hat
made
her
run
for
shelter
the
trees
of
the
avenue
gave
a
long
sigh
and
the
rain
swished
down
in
torrents
round
the
corner
she
saw
mrs
mamble
running
about
like
a
woman
possessed
after
the
washing
that
she
had
spread
on
the
bushes
to
dry
slip
into
the
porch
miss
she
cried
catching
sight
of
susie
or
you
ll
be
then
she
called
to
mary
who
was
ironing
in
the
kitchen
there
s
a
young
lady
got
caught
in
the
storm
mrs
malpas
please
come
inside
and
wait
till
it
s
over
mary
cried
glancing
through
the
window
susie
entered
take
a
seat
mary
said
and
went
on
with
her
ironing
one
side
of
her
face
was
flushed
with
the
heat
of
the
iron
that
she
had
tested
by
holding
it
to
her
cheek
it
made
her
look
as
if
she
were
angry
or
embarrassed
the
kitchen
was
full
of
the
sweet
scorched
smell
of
linen
susie
sitting
nervously
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
to
which
she
had
been
shown
felt
that
the
falseness
of
her
position
must
be
made
clear
she
was
out
to
fight
and
not
without
courage
my
name
is
hind
susan
hind
she
said
from
the
pound
house
you
mary
stopped
ironing
and
looked
at
her
she
began
to
wish
that
she
had
not
turned
herself
out
so
elegantly
she
felt
that
she
must
look
like
a
yes
i
thought
i
knew
you
mary
said
i
came
over
to
speak
to
susie
hesitated
about
mr
fellows
yes
there
s
a
tale
going
round
she
faltered
she
wished
that
she
were
not
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
that
mary
were
not
taller
than
herself
there
was
something
unfair
and
consciously
superior
in
the
woman
s
plain
white
apron
more
than
this
she
had
the
subtle
inexplicable
advantage
of
being
a
married
woman
with
children
even
if
her
husband
had
deserted
her
mary
put
down
her
iron
on
its
stand
and
looked
her
full
in
the
eyes
now
her
cheeks
were
equally
flushed
susie
wished
that
she
would
speak
even
if
she
were
only
to
repeat
her
provocative
yes
she
took
fright
suddenly
stood
up
and
plunged
it
s
not
fair
she
cried
you
know
it
s
not
fair
you
a
married
woman
that
have
had
your
life
and
a
couple
of
children
but
as
soon
as
your
husband
s
well
out
of
sight
you
must
go
running

she
laughed
that
s
a
fine
word
to
use
for
the
likes
of
you
she
gave
a
gasp
for
breath
then
with
a
flash
of
hopeless
hatred
as
though
she
were
searching
the
room
for
something
that
her
violence
might
appropriately
destroy
she
went
out
blindly
into
the
rain
mary
stood
rigidly
at
her
a
flash
of
lightning
ripped
the
sky
in
front
of
her
window
nearly
blinding
her
and
her
lips
uttered
a
cry
mrs
mamble
ran
in
with
her
skirt
thrown
over
her
head
for
she
was
frightened
of
thunder
my
she
cried
from
under
the
skirt
my
what
a
downpour
she
looked
out
timidly
well
i
never
she
s
gone
yes
said
mary
with
a
helpless
laugh
she
s
gone
gone
why
the
girl
must
be
mad
again
mary
laughed
at
the
wide
astonishment
in
mrs
mamble
s
eyes
another
flash
followed
and
the
old
woman
wrapped
up
her
head
again
waiting
for
the
thunder
it
came
with
a
crash
right
overhead
and
the
house
shook
mary
suddenly
remembered
the
children
who
were
playing
in
the
parlour
do
go
and
see
to
them
mrs
mamble
she
said
there
s
a
she
herself
could
not
move
she
went
on
folding
her
linen
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
find
some
mechanical
task
for
her
hands
to
do
in
a
moment
mrs
mamble
returned
to
say
that
the
children
were
not
in
the
least
frightened
she
kept
dodging
in
and
out
of
the
house
all
afternoon
for
fear
of
the
storm
returning
and
catching
her
unawares
telling
of
the
damage
that
the
rain
might
have
done
to
the
hay
lying
out
in
the
meadows
or
to
the
standing
corn
but
there
s
no
denying
that
it
s
wanted
she
said
inconsequently
by
the
time
that
abner
left
work
that
evening
the
storm
had
rolled
away
rumbling
over
the
treetops
of
bringewood
chase
all
day
he
had
worked
under
the
heavy
sky
breathing
an
air
that
was
dead
and
choked
with
dust
now
the
vault
was
clear
and
brilliant
as
that
of
an
evening
in
spring
the
smell
of
dust
rose
from
the
road
blackbirds
were
singing
and
from
the
pale
steaming
hayfields
waves
of
sweetness
drifted
across
his
path
his
steps
were
light
and
his
heart
happy
mary
received
him
as
usual
and
gave
him
his
tea
he
laughed
with
her
over
the
violence
of
the
storm
and
asked
her
gaily
if
the
doctor
had
been
to
take
the
splint
off
gladys
s
leg
we
must
put
by
a
shillin
or
two
for
that
he
said
for
the
moment
he
was
so
full
of
his
own
content
that
he
had
scarcely
noticed
her
preoccupation
but
when
he
mentioned
money
she
made
a
quick
instinctive
movement
as
though
she
wanted
to
speak
and
to
refuse
it
little
by
little
he
began
to
realise
that
she
was
trying
to
avoid
him
and
sometimes
leaving
his
questions
unanswered
what
s
up
with
you
missus
he
said
nothing
she
replied
nothing
at
all
that
i
know
but
her
denial
did
not
convince
him
all
the
evening
he
tried
to
guess
what
could
have
upset
her
but
she
evaded
him
pretending
that
she
was
her
normal
self
he
knew
better
even
when
she
spoke
to
the
children
or
to
mrs
mamble
who
came
in
to
talk
about
the
havoc
of
the
storm
and
to
give
them
the
news
that
a
sheep
had
been
struck
by
lightning
on
williams
s
farm
mary
was
listless
and
dull
abner
used
her
gently
he
knew
that
women
must
have
their
moods
and
that
a
man
needed
to
be
patient
with
them
if
he
would
be
happy
but
day
after
day
now
passed
without
any
change
in
her
attitude
since
the
discovery
of
his
own
passion
that
he
had
made
by
the
pool
it
had
been
hard
enough
as
it
was
for
him
to
live
with
her
on
ordinary
terms
but
now
even
though
he
humoured
her
she
was
distant
with
him
he
tried
to
make
her
explain
herself
she
only
shook
her
head
it
seemed
indeed
as
if
a
single
day
had
thrown
them
back
into
all
the
awkwardness
of
his
early
life
at
wolfpits
and
that
she
had
suddenly
taken
it
into
her
head
to
upset
the
convention
under
which
they
had
agreed
to
live
most
of
all
she
avoided
him
whenever
he
spoke
of
money
and
when
he
brought
her
his
wages
at
the
end
of
the
week
she
left
them
lying
on
the
table
as
though
touching
them
would
have
burned
her
fingers
if
he
had
not
loved
the
woman
and
her
children
too
he
would
have
broken
away
in
accordance
with
his
nature
as
it
was
he
hung
on
sore
and
bewildered
wondering
what
new
coldness
she
could
inflict
upon
him
another
shock
awaited
her
one
day
when
abner
was
away
at
work
the
postman
bicycled
up
to
wolfpits
and
handed
her
a
letter
this
was
so
rare
an
event
at
wolfpits
that
the
man
waited
as
country
postmen
who
also
act
as
interpreters
often
do
to
hear
its
contents
you
ll
see
by
the
postmark
it
s
come
from
shrewsbury
he
said
yes
so
i
see
she
replied
thrusting
it
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
she
had
already
recognised
george
s
freehand
writing
he
went
away
but
she
kept
the
letter
in
her
pocket
unopened
she
dared
not
open
it
and
when
at
last
she
did
so
the
words
sent
a
chill
over
all
her
body
dear
read
i
may
be
doing
time
i
m
not
yet
dead
that
i
know
say
that
love
is
don
t
you
go
imagining
that
other
people
haven
t
got
loving
she
was
seized
with
a
pain
that
had
scarcely
abated
when
abner
came
home
at
night
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
to
him
she
desired
passionately
to
show
him
the
letter
but
shame
would
not
let
her
do
so
he
in
his
turn
was
sick
of
the
wretchedness
of
their
present
relation
and
when
the
children
had
been
put
to
bed
he
told
her
so
in
words
that
he
had
chosen
for
their
roughness
she
stared
at
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
supper
table
with
grief
and
resentment
in
her
eyes
if
it
s
as
bad
as
that
what
makes
you
stay
here
she
said
slowly
i
like
that
he
replied
you
know
as
well
as
i
she
took
fright
at
this
for
she
wasn
t
sure
of
his
meaning
though
she
knew
in
her
heart
what
she
wanted
him
to
mean
she
was
afraid
that
he
would
guess
at
her
unspoken
admission
don
t
keep
you
here
she
said
he
got
up
and
walked
the
room
a
hurled
itself
against
the
shade
of
the
lamp
with
a
sharp
ringing
sound
and
fell
crippled
on
the
tablecloth
it
s
hurt
she
cried
kill
it
abner
crushed
the
insect
with
his
thumb
and
threw
it
in
the
fireplace
the
coppery
bloom
came
off
on
his
fingers
for
a
moment
she
was
hypnotised
watching
him
then
she
recovered
her
senses
i
don
t
keep
you
there
s
no
need
for
you
to
stay
in
every
night
she
said
no
there
bain
t
i
m
damned
if
there
be
he
replied
he
picked
up
his
cap
and
walked
out
of
the
room
she
nearly
ran
after
him
to
thrust
george
s
letter
into
his
hand
but
she
was
too
late
so
much
the
better
she
thought
she
felt
that
she
had
been
saved
from
some
calamity
he
set
off
walking
furiously
through
the
mellow
evening
trying
to
cool
his
blood
with
violent
exertion
as
instinctively
as
an
animal
eats
grass
by
nightfall
he
had
reached
the
remote
valley
nine
miles
away
in
folds
of
the
forest
of
clun
whither
his
friends
the
cloggers
had
returned
in
the
spring
he
found
their
canvas
pitched
in
a
coomb
under
high
sheepwalks
and
wigan
joe
made
him
as
welcome
as
ever
they
sat
out
in
the
soft
moonless
night
talking
and
drinking
beer
it
was
like
old
times
for
abner
to
hear
joe
reeling
off
stories
one
after
another
in
his
flat
lancashire
dialect
he
lolled
there
listening
till
the
company
grew
drowsy
there
was
no
question
of
his
returning
to
wolfpits
that
night
for
the
sky
drooped
like
a
pall
of
velvet
on
the
earth
and
he
could
never
have
found
his
way
he
turned
in
with
the
others
on
a
pile
of
dried
bracken
waking
at
dawn
to
set
off
again
toward
chapel
green
for
a
few
hours
he
had
shed
his
restlessness
but
when
he
reached
wolfpits
in
the
evening
the
sense
of
restraint
descended
on
him
again
he
felt
that
mary
was
watching
him
wondering
where
he
had
been
her
eyes
were
tragic
and
as
he
thought
reproachful
this
only
irritated
him
he
couldn
t
be
bothered
with
her
moods
when
speaking
to
mrs
mamble
he
happened
to
mention
that
he
had
walked
over
in
the
evening
to
the
sloggers
workings
she
looked
at
him
with
such
a
searching
suspicion
that
he
could
not
contain
himself
what
s
up
with
you
he
said
do
you
think
i
m
codding
you
she
looked
away
without
answering
there
s
no
need
to
believe
me
if
you
don
t
want
to
he
said
and
what
the
hell
did
it
matter
to
her
where
he
went
or
what
he
did
if
he
were
to
leave
her
to
herself
for
a
bit
perhaps
she
d
begin
to
realise
that
he
was
useful
and
that
it
wouldn
t
pay
her
to
treat
him
like
dirt
it
was
time
she
had
a
lesson
he
spent
the
next
evening
with
mick
connor
in
a
pub
at
lesswardine
mixing
his
drinks
standing
treat
recklessly
he
had
to
borrow
six
shillings
from
mick
to
pay
his
score
it
pleased
him
to
think
how
mary
would
stare
at
his
money
next
saturday
when
she
found
it
six
bob
short
she
who
was
too
proud
to
pick
it
up
when
he
gave
it
her
at
the
yellow
turnpike
house
outside
lesswardine
their
paths
diverged
and
this
was
unfortunate
for
it
was
easier
to
walk
arm
in
arm
mick
left
him
but
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
alone
the
vision
of
mary
returned
to
him
mary
as
he
had
seen
her
and
desired
her
sitting
pale
on
the
border
of
the
pool
a
fortnight
ago
in
his
perverse
and
drunken
mind
he
hated
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
been
making
a
fool
of
him
alternately
alluring
and
rejecting
he
walked
along
sweating
violently
in
the
direction
of
mainstone
wishing
to
god
he
d
never
known
the
damned
woman
women
and
yet
a
lusty
man
of
his
age
couldn
t
live
without
women
it
was
against
nature
to
live
without
women
and
a
man
was
a
fool
if
he
did
so
he
went
hot
and
cold
thrilled
with
voluptuous
sensations
he
laughed
at
himself
and
staggered
up
to
a
gate
at
the
side
of
the
road
to
light
his
pipe
he
broke
three
matches
and
then
discovered
that
they
were
damp
and
would
not
strike
he
remembered
indefinitely
that
mick
had
upset
a
pint
of
beer
into
his
pocket
he
cursed
the
matches
and
mick
together
a
light
breeze
moved
above
him
and
as
in
the
distance
he
heard
a
sound
like
that
of
a
gentle
shower
falling
on
leaves
in
june
a
sound
that
meant
something
to
his
memory
he
became
suddenly
aware
that
he
was
standing
at
that
moment
on
the
outskirts
of
mainstone
village
immediately
beneath
a
big
poplar
tree
a
dozen
times
he
had
stood
there
in
the
shadow
waiting
for
the
light
to
go
out
in
the
windows
of
the
pound
house
for
the
steps
of
bastard
to
pass
him
for
the
moment
when
he
might
safely
steal
across
to
susie
s
door
his
pulse
quickened
some
hidden
instinct
must
have
made
him
stop
there
no
light
could
be
seen
but
there
in
the
darkness
was
a
woman
whom
he
could
have
for
the
asking
he
pulled
himself
together
and
a
moment
later
was
standing
by
the
outhouse
door
he
threw
a
clod
at
her
she
had
better
not
try
putting
him
off
if
he
had
to
climb
in
at
her
window
she
must
come
to
him
he
fretted
with
impatience
but
he
had
not
long
to
wait
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
opened
the
back
door
he
heard
the
door
scrape
but
it
was
so
dark
that
he
could
not
see
her
he
put
out
his
hands
groping
in
the
darkness
and
found
her
warm
and
breathing
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
again
she
whispered
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
clothed
her
in
kisses
she
clung
to
him
breathing
softly
while
his
kisses
enveloped
her
his
misery
left
him
vanished
miraculously
in
the
darkness
in
the
black
confusion
of
his
thoughts
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
were
kissing
mary
malpas
the
twentieth
chapter
a
strange
fate
awaited
this
renewal
of
passion
over
the
border
in
wales
where
many
dark
and
violent
things
are
born
a
sultry
flame
had
been
kindled
about
this
time
in
the
heart
of
a
wesleyan
local
preacher
named
evan
hughes
he
was
a
montgomery
peasant
a
carpenter
by
trade
on
whom
brooding
over
the
historical
sanctity
of
his
calling
an
inspiration
had
fallen
he
preached
in
the
chapel
bethesda
in
the
hamlet
llandewi
waterdine
he
spoke
in
the
dialect
of
his
his
words
were
ludicrous
and
pathetic
but
the
fire
that
scorched
his
heart
was
in
them
so
that
men
and
women
rode
over
the
mountains
on
their
ponies
to
hear
him
and
many
professed
themselves
converted
why
or
to
what
they
were
converted
it
would
be
hard
to
say
unless
it
were
that
the
isolation
of
their
lives
laid
them
open
to
long
broodings
on
sin
and
on
salvation
and
that
knowing
as
all
men
know
that
they
were
sinful
they
could
not
be
happy
in
solitude
till
they
were
saved
the
unconverted
said
maliciously
that
evan
hughes
had
been
shocked
into
sanctity
by
proceedings
of
affiliation
and
a
maintenance
order
however
this
may
have
been
his
preaching
was
on
chastity
of
the
body
and
more
particularly
of
the
bodies
of
women
a
doctrine
that
was
acceptable
for
the
most
obvious
reasons
to
married
men
with
wives
younger
than
themselves
and
on
sentimental
grounds
to
young
unmarried
girls
the
flame
spread
quickly
through
these
green
shoots
and
the
dry
withered
twigs
went
up
with
a
crackle
women
of
sixty
years
and
older
stood
up
on
the
chapel
floor
and
prayed
god
to
grant
them
continence
evan
hughes
with
a
singular
lack
of
humour
hailed
them
as
souls
plucked
from
hell
and
greeted
them
as
sisters
thus
having
cleansed
the
kerry
hills
and
the
borders
of
clun
he
set
his
eyes
like
any
spiritual
freebooter
on
the
english
border
cursing
the
fatness
and
laxness
of
the
teme
valley
so
violently
and
with
such
free
quotations
from
the
prophet
jeremiah
that
the
local
circuit
invited
him
to
conduct
a
revival
from
their
pulpits
first
he
came
to
chapel
green
and
naturally
enough
converted
old
mrs
malpas
who
was
always
on
the
side
of
the
angels
she
sat
under
him
with
tears
streaming
from
her
eyes
for
the
sins
of
her
friends
and
afterward
had
the
honour
of
putting
him
up
at
the
buffalo
in
spite
of
his
prejudices
against
the
licensed
trade
on
this
the
first
sunday
of
the
revival
the
chapel
green
methodists
achieved
the
authentic
shiver
and
the
vicar
of
mainstone
who
had
heard
all
about
it
made
a
reconnaissance
of
his
parish
shaking
his
head
and
warning
his
people
against
the
influence
of
unhealthy
fanatics
it
s
a
crime
he
said
putting
such
ideas
into
young
people
s
minds
we
don
t
want
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
country
mainstone
is
a
clean
parish
apart
from
that
unfortunate
young
mrs
malpas
at
wolfpits
there
is
scarcely
an
unsavoury
household
in
in
spite
of
this
official
discouragement
evan
hughes
increased
the
revival
unlike
those
epidemics
of
disease
which
afflict
the
body
spread
steadily
eastward
chapel
green
with
its
sober
bucolic
population
had
made
the
mildest
of
beginnings
at
mainstone
half
the
vicar
s
congregation
thronged
the
chapel
people
walked
over
from
lesswardine
on
the
sunday
evening
in
little
laughing
groups
and
returned
in
silence
with
a
roman
segregation
of
the
sexes
those
who
scoffed
had
such
a
bad
time
of
it
that
they
held
their
tongues
among
the
victims
of
this
collective
exaltation
was
susie
hind
no
doubt
the
violence
of
her
renewed
passion
for
abner
had
thrown
her
into
an
emotional
state
abner
was
now
absorbed
in
it
and
content
to
be
absorbed
seeing
that
in
this
way
he
purchased
forgetfulness
but
susie
had
to
run
the
risk
of
discovery
or
worse
until
her
nerves
were
all
on
edge
at
first
abner
could
not
make
out
what
was
the
matter
with
her
one
sunday
night
she
cried
and
cried
in
his
arms
and
would
not
tell
him
why
for
the
rest
of
the
week
she
brooded
on
the
extremity
of
her
sin
then
with
the
same
queer
directness
that
had
driven
her
to
confront
mary
malpas
some
time
before
she
sought
an
interview
with
the
evangelist
and
laid
her
confession
before
him
he
turned
away
from
her
don
t
tell
me
he
said
i
can
not
hear
these
things
my
ears
are
full
of
them
and
sin
no
and
remember
me
when
you
she
went
home
burning
but
humiliated
and
gave
herself
up
to
an
ecstasy
of
in
prayer
when
the
men
joked
with
her
in
the
bar
at
night
she
would
not
listen
to
them
next
sunday
she
went
again
to
the
chapel
and
wept
she
knew
that
after
dark
that
night
abner
would
come
and
call
her
she
loved
him
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
immortal
soul
was
more
precious
than
mortal
love
and
here
were
two
souls
to
be
saved
she
lay
stiff
in
bed
waiting
for
his
signal
compelling
herself
to
be
cold
a
clod
struck
the
she
clasped
her
hands
in
an
attitude
of
prayer
and
lay
like
a
stone
again
he
signalled
to
her
she
dared
not
lie
there
any
longer
for
fear
he
should
become
impatient
and
waken
her
father
she
slipped
on
some
clothes
and
came
to
the
door
i
can
t
see
you
abner
she
whispered
hurriedly
i
can
t
let
you
in
i
can
t
don
t
ask
he
thought
she
had
taken
leave
of
her
senses
what
the
devil
s
up
with
you
he
said
she
shook
her
head
and
would
have
closed
the
door
on
him
but
he
put
his
foot
in
it
don
t
she
said
oh
don
t
he
had
no
intention
of
being
put
off
like
this
he
tried
to
kiss
her
but
she
kept
him
at
arm
s
length
and
when
he
had
done
his
best
with
persuasions
and
still
could
get
no
sense
from
her
he
became
angry
and
raised
his
voice
now
genuine
fear
was
added
to
her
other
emotions
and
in
order
that
he
should
not
awaken
her
father
she
consented
at
last
to
follow
him
out
into
the
lane
he
was
on
the
point
of
agreeing
when
it
flashed
into
his
mind
that
this
was
only
a
ruse
to
get
him
away
from
the
door
so
that
she
might
lock
it
in
his
face
the
only
explanation
that
suggested
itself
to
him
was
that
she
might
be
expecting
another
lover
no
you
don
t
my
girl
he
said
you
ll
come
along
with
he
waited
for
her
and
in
another
moment
they
had
crossed
the
road
under
the
shadow
of
the
poplar
from
that
point
she
could
see
the
roof
of
the
cottage
where
the
evangelist
was
staying
the
gable
rose
up
high
like
a
symbol
of
the
power
she
was
obeying
not
here
she
whispered
we
might
be
he
helped
her
over
the
gate
taking
her
down
in
his
arms
she
stiffened
beneath
his
touch
a
heavy
dew
had
come
out
on
the
grass
that
washed
her
ankles
as
she
walked
for
she
had
not
pulled
on
her
stockings
owls
were
hunting
in
the
misty
starlight
one
floated
before
them
along
the
on
quiet
wings
he
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
now
what
s
it
all
about
he
said
she
hurried
to
tell
him
before
it
grew
more
difficult
stammering
with
haste
but
when
she
came
to
the
story
of
her
conversion
and
her
interview
with
evan
hughes
she
felt
the
weight
of
his
ridicule
overbearing
her
she
hadn
t
humbled
herself
enough
to
bear
the
indignity
of
being
laughed
at
and
least
of
all
by
abner
she
stopped
suddenly
let
me
go
back
she
said
trying
to
free
herself
let
me
go
back
he
only
held
her
closer
what
s
all
this
havering
he
said
what
s
up
with
you
eh
give
us
a
kiss
she
put
her
hands
up
to
his
mouth
struggling
i
can
t
i
can
t
what
do
you
want
then
she
took
her
plunge
abner
why
don
t
you
marry
me
she
said
marry
you
marry
he
cried
he
laughed
out
loud
at
the
idea
then
it
came
to
him
in
a
flash
that
there
must
be
some
urgent
reason
for
her
request
people
in
his
class
and
in
that
part
of
the
country
rarely
married
unless
they
were
obliged
to
in
accordance
with
the
local
custom
he
had
been
caught
in
the
same
way
as
nine
out
of
ten
of
his
married
mates
it
was
like
his
cursed
luck
he
wouldn
t
believe
it
his
first
feeling
was
one
of
bitter
rage
he
saw
himself
tied
hand
and
foot
helplessly
handed
over
to
the
commonest
of
fates
another
fool
caught
in
the
web
that
women
spun
for
a
free
man
s
undoing
he
saw
in
front
of
him
an
endless
dull
routine
of
life
at
mainstone
he
saw
himself
finished
and
the
idea
of
paternity
gave
no
consolation
to
his
bitterness
then
in
the
same
swift
vision
he
saw
the
little
household
at
wolfpits
that
depended
on
him
for
support
and
among
them
the
wan
devoted
face
of
mary
malpas
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
before
he
said
at
last
how
do
you
know
you
re
like
that
she
flushed
in
the
dark
with
an
involuntary
affectation
of
modesty
how
dare
you
she
cried
how
dare
you
i
m
not
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
then
what
the
hell
is
all
this
talk
of
marrying
about
he
cried
what
d
you
take
me
for
i
m
not
that
soft
he
laughed
out
loud
in
the
suddenness
of
his
relief
it
stung
her
pride
to
think
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
anger
boiled
up
in
her
and
she
forgot
all
her
pietistic
resolves
as
she
freed
herself
in
abuse
in
a
single
second
the
penitent
had
been
turned
into
a
virago
mad
with
jealousy
letting
fly
at
him
a
spate
of
foul
words
that
she
had
learned
in
the
taproom
she
didn
t
stop
to
think
what
she
was
saying
the
words
swept
over
her
mind
in
a
flood
and
made
her
deaf
then
she
saw
abner
shaking
with
laughter
at
her
performance
and
pulled
herself
together
i
ve
finished
with
you
you
great
beast
she
said
a
dirty
chap
that
goes
running
all
over
the
country
after
women
i
m
not
going
to
take
turn
and
turn
about
with
a
married
woman
so
don
t
you
think
it
you
and
that
great
stick
of
a
condover
as
george
malpas
got
sick
and
tired
of
in
three
year
you
and
your
mary
here
drop
that
said
abner
darkly
shut
your
mouth
drop
it
she
cried
you
re
not
going
to
shut
my
mouth
when
the
whole
village
is
disgusted
with
you
and
your
goings
on
and
her
putting
on
a
face
as
innocent
as
a
saint
and
taking
the
children
out
for
walks
poor
little
devils
you
wait
till
george
comes
back
and
then
she
ll
show
you
the
back
door
quick
enough
i
don
t
know
what
you
want
taking
up
with
a
piece
of
muck
like
that
you
re
a
dirty
hypocrite
and
as
for
her
abner
stopped
her
mouth
but
she
fought
and
struggled
next
time
you
d
better
go
farther
off
than
redlake
she
spluttered
you
dirty
rotten
swine
it
was
lucky
for
her
that
she
wrenched
herself
away
from
him
for
abner
s
blood
was
in
his
head
she
went
running
like
a
madwoman
over
the
ghostly
field
if
she
had
stayed
he
could
have
murdered
her
slowly
following
he
came
to
himself
and
wondered
what
the
devil
he
was
doing
in
that
damp
field
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
cursed
all
women
as
he
saw
them
in
her
violent
image
but
when
he
set
his
feet
on
the
high
road
his
anger
had
subsided
and
he
began
to
realise
how
blind
he
had
been
he
knew
that
susie
had
probably
spoken
no
less
than
the
truth
about
the
local
scandals
looking
backward
he
found
that
he
could
explain
the
smiles
and
winks
and
sidelong
glances
of
his
mates
fine
friends
they
were
who
made
sport
of
a
man
and
never
told
him
why
and
it
dawned
on
him
still
stupidly
incredulous
that
this
trouble
and
nothing
else
was
the
cause
of
the
change
in
mary
s
behaviour
the
thing
that
had
snatched
her
so
violently
away
from
him
no
doubt
it
had
come
to
her
ears
through
mrs
mamble
all
women
were
spiteful
by
nature
and
could
not
resist
the
pleasant
temptation
of
giving
pain
to
others
of
their
kind
they
had
let
her
know
in
some
covert
way
what
folk
were
saying
and
she
too
proud
to
confide
in
him
was
protecting
herself
as
best
she
could
he
knew
her
pride
he
wished
to
god
she
were
not
so
proud
and
yet
since
that
was
her
nature
he
must
be
patient
with
her
he
was
not
built
for
patience
walking
home
to
wolfpits
with
the
high
road
beneath
him
and
the
mild
humming
of
telegraph
wires
that
stretched
away
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
above
he
felt
once
more
the
restlessness
with
which
his
spirit
was
so
familiar
the
desire
that
had
come
over
him
in
fierce
gusts
from
time
to
time
ever
since
the
days
of
his
childhood
the
will
to
be
free
to
cut
all
coils
and
launch
out
into
the
life
to
which
he
had
a
right
ever
since
his
boyhood
he
had
been
as
much
a
prisoner
as
george
malpas
and
for
even
less
reason
breaking
free
from
mawne
and
reaching
out
over
these
hills
he
had
merely
passed
from
one
prison
to
another
the
only
periods
of
freedom
he
had
known
had
been
those
days
with
his
father
before
alice
came
to
hackett
s
cottages
and
the
week
of
his
travels
on
the
road
with
mick
connor
always
somehow
or
other
a
woman
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
his
slavery
women
were
the
curse
of
his
existence
it
pleased
him
fiercely
to
think
that
in
his
breach
with
susie
he
had
shorn
through
one
of
these
shackles
he
hated
women
and
yet
in
his
heart
he
could
not
remember
mary
without
tenderness
and
knew
that
however
loudly
he
might
protest
he
was
going
back
along
the
road
to
wolfpits
of
his
own
free
will
and
whatever
it
might
cost
him
must
stay
there
until
george
malpas
returned
that
night
he
was
too
late
to
see
mary
but
next
morning
when
he
arrived
at
the
work
he
tackled
munn
on
the
subject
of
the
redlake
scandal
what
do
they
say
about
me
and
mrs
malpas
joe
he
asked
munn
stammered
nowt
as
i
know
ab
he
said
drop
that
kid
don
t
you
come
that
over
me
he
said
spit
it
out
naught
out
of
the
way
munn
said
at
last
they
say
as
you
and
her
is
pretty
oh
they
do
do
they
said
abner
and
what
do
you
think
about
it
eh
it
s
none
of
my
business
said
munn
doggedly
no
more
it
is
my
son
abner
laughed
get
on
with
it
they
said
you
d
been
caught
out
over
at
then
it
s
that
bleeder
badger
said
abner
wait
till
i
see
the
sod
that
all
i
didn
t
hear
no
more
said
munn
well
kid
said
abner
you
keep
clear
of
the
women
don
t
you
have
naught
to
do
with
them
no
fear
said
munn
with
a
smirk
of
his
abner
had
meant
to
have
the
matter
out
with
mary
but
when
he
thought
it
over
he
saw
that
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
this
he
understood
her
awkwardness
and
knowing
the
delicacy
of
her
temper
left
well
alone
she
on
her
part
would
have
suffered
an
agony
of
shame
in
showing
him
george
s
letter
after
his
final
interview
with
susie
she
noticed
a
change
in
him
and
wondered
what
had
caused
it
he
began
to
spend
his
evenings
again
at
wolfpits
going
out
to
talk
in
the
stables
with
old
drew
picking
baskets
of
fruit
from
the
walled
garden
and
working
more
rarely
in
their
own
tilled
plot
she
was
curious
to
know
what
had
happened
but
kept
her
thoughts
to
herself
and
was
grateful
at
least
for
his
forbearance
she
had
heard
no
more
of
george
and
though
she
had
lived
in
fear
of
seeing
old
mrs
malpas
ever
since
susie
s
visit
had
told
her
that
the
new
scandal
was
abroad
the
weeks
passed
by
and
no
outside
intelligence
penetrated
the
remoteness
of
wolfpits
at
times
when
she
saw
abner
moving
quietly
about
the
heavy
work
of
the
house
she
was
overwhelmed
with
a
sensation
which
she
persuaded
herself
was
gratitude
and
longed
to
burst
through
the
convention
of
silence
or
commonplace
that
bound
them
it
would
have
been
fairer
she
thought
to
open
her
heart
to
him
to
stand
face
to
face
without
a
veil
between
but
she
did
not
know
what
her
own
heart
contained
or
what
the
veil
concealed
and
her
courage
always
failed
her
not
only
would
her
confession
involve
an
abasement
a
sacrifice
of
pride
that
she
could
not
face
but
heaven
only
knew
where
it
might
lead
and
yet
in
spite
of
these
things
they
were
almost
happy
one
wednesday
evening
early
in
august
just
before
the
gang
knocked
off
for
the
day
the
clerk
of
the
works
came
walking
gingerly
among
the
scattered
culverts
to
the
trench
in
which
abner
and
munn
were
working

carried
a
paper
in
his
hand
which
he
consulted

eyes
before
he
addressed
them

mumbled

said
abner
the
clerk
went
blundering
on
to
another
trench
having
ticked
off
two
names
on
his
list
well
joe
said
abner

munn

abner
laughed
you
wait
and
see
the
siren
sounded
and
connor
came
along
the
trench
whistling
jauntily
as
he
always
did
when
he
was
up
against
it
got
the
boot
mick
abner
asked
mick
nodded
it
breaks
the
heart
in
me
to
think
i
m
afther
leavin
all
them
pheasants
he
said
off
on
the
touch
again
that

what

the
only
place
to
live
in
and
i

at
punchestown
if

only
hawking
of
dead
roses
of
jericho
round
the
basements
of
merrion
square
shure
an
you
ll
come
along
wud
me
abner
shook
his
head
god
help
you
you
couldn
t
be
worse
if
you
was
married
said
mick
with
a
leer
abner
laughed
he
knew
mick
connor
too
well
to
take
his
tongue
seriously
that
night
when
he
went
home
he
did
not
tell
mary
what
had
happened
for
it
seemed
to
him
his
news
would
only
disturb
her
needlessly
at
the
same
time
he
knew
that
something
must
be
done
and
after
tea
he
went
down
to
the
bridge
to
wait
for
old
drew
s
return
the
labourer
looked
at
him
and
scratched
his
head
that
s
the
worst
of
they
casual
jobs
he
said
money
yes
but
you
never
get
knowed
and
there
s
nothing
permanent
to
abner
asked
how
he
should
set
about
finding
a
job
in
the
district
and
the
old
man
looked
solemn
i
rackon
you
ll
find
it
easy
enough
for
a
month
or
maybe
six
week
with
the
harvest
coming
they
be
glad
of
any
help
they
can
get
in
they
times
after
that
you
can
whistle
for
anything
ll
do
for
me
said
abner
now
mark
ee
tis
like
this
the
old
man
explained
this
country
when
fust
i
know
d
en
were
a
tarrable
place
for
barley
and
wheat
but
now
like
the
vules
they
be
they
ve
a
given
it
up
and
gone
in
for
this
dairyin
proper
women
s
work
i
call
it
and
women
be
cheap
in
these
parts
as
they
ought
to
be
i
don
t
say
as
there
ban
t
the
apples
as
sufficient
unto
the
day
was
the
evil
thereof
abner
knew
now
that
he
could
not
look
beyond
the
harvest
for
regular
work
but
harvest
labour
being
rare
was
well
paid
and
by
working
overtime
he
might
easily
amass
a
little
store
of
money
more
than
that
he
might
even
prolong
his
employment
if
he
made
good
friends
by
helping
to
pick
the
yellow
apples
from
which
thin
shropshire
cider
is
made
but
on
this
he
knew
well
he
could
not
count
with
any
certainty
as
the
orchards
were
alien
and
few
he
begged
old
drew
not
to
mention
his
quest
to
any
one
at
wolfpits
and
the
old
man
blinked
his
assent
next
sunday
evening
he
said
to
the
friends
who
shared
in
his
dismissal
munn
who
had
scraped
together
a
little
money
was
going
to
ludlow
where
he
would
catch
a
train
for
dulston
mick
connor
being
sick
of
england
as
he
said
was
tramping
north
to
holyhead
abner
walked
with
him
to
the
crest
of
hills
above
clun
if
you
re
ever
in
the
city
of
dublin
mick
said
all
you
ve
got
to
do
is
to
go
into
nagle
s
back
ask
for
the
devil
they
call
kerry
mick
used
to
lodge
with
mother
muldoon
and
the
grocer
s
curate
ll
give
you
a
naggn
for
the
love
on
abner
watched
him
swing
away
down
the
hill
with
his
loping
stride
he
returned
home
late
at
night
mary
contrary
to
her
custom
was
sitting
up
for
him
she
sat
at
the
table
reading
and
he
quickly
tumbled
to
her
reason
for
doing
so
in
the
midst
of
his
farewells
he
had
forgotten
to
give
her
his
week
s
wages
the
night
before
she
would
not
ask
him
for
money
but
she
was
hoping
that
her
unusual
presence
would
make
him
realise
what
he
had
forgotten
seeing
this
he
was
tempted
for
a
moment
to
withhold
it
to
wait
and
see
what
she
would
do
to
force
her
into
a
spiritual
submission
but
then
he
remembered
that
the
shock
which
he
was
being
forced
to
give
her
would
be
quite
enough
here
s
the
brass
he
said
placing
it
on
the
table
in
front
of
her
thank
you
abner
she
said
i
reckon
it
s
got
to
go
a
long
way
this
week
i
ve
kept
none
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
it
s
going
to
be
the
last
far
as
i
can
for
a
second
she
thought
that
the
moment
had
come
that
her
coldness
had
actually
forced
him
into
leaving
her
remorse
mingled
with
cold
fear
for
the
future
overwhelmed
her
but
he
saw
her
bewilderment
and
told
her
simply
what
had
happened
i
ve
got
to
look
out
for
work
he
said
it
may
come
along
any
day
only
the
harvest
s
we
shall
have
to
manage
she
said
calmly
you
can
trust
me
to
do
the
best
i
she
stood
waiting
as
if
she
wanted
to
say
something
more
but
at
the
last
her
courage
failed
her
i
have
a
few
shillings
put
by
she
said
i
always
thought
something
might
well
yo
m
a
marvel
and
no
mistake
he
cried
during
his
first
week
of
idleness
abner
went
out
every
day
visiting
the
farms
of
the
neighbourhood
in
search
of
a
promise
of
harvest
work
it
was
a
lean
year
the
drought
of
the
summer
had
stunted
the
straw
a
couple
of
violent
thunderstorms
had
done
more
harm
than
good
and
the
farmers
were
now
hanging
on
as
long
as
they
dared
gambling
on
the
chance
of
rain
that
was
due
wherever
abner
went
they
shook
their
heads
can
t
say
when
we
ll
be
cutting
they
said
next
week
or
week
after
or
three
weeks
time
it
depends
on
the
weather
and
the
damned
stuff
s
that
poor
it
isn
t
worth
reaping
worse
than
the
hay
and
that
s
saying
something
at
night
when
he
came
home
mary
looked
anxiously
for
his
news
but
he
could
tell
her
nothing
he
made
casts
farther
afield
he
did
not
care
how
far
he
went
if
only
he
could
find
work
but
down
in
the
plains
although
he
could
see
for
himself
that
the
ears
were
fuller
he
was
met
by
the
same
evasive
replies
he
came
to
hate
the
sight
of
these
sour
prosperous
farmers
it
seemed
to
him
that
they
all
had
the
same
callous
faces
as
the
distant
mr
cookson
who
had
killed
his
dog
but
he
knew
better
than
to
let
spider
follow
him
on
these
visits
you
might
try
mr
prosser
of
the
dyke
said
old
drew
one
evening
that
be
a
fine
big
farm
and
they
say
he
do
go
in
for
next
day
abner
visited
the
dyke
it
was
a
farm
that
he
had
missed
in
his
former
expeditions
a
house
buried
in
beechwoods
that
stood
unappropriately
high
and
dry
on
a
lofty
ridge
south
of
the
main
road
between
mainstone
and
lesswardine
it
lay
five
miles
from
wolfpits
as
the
crow
flies
and
nearly
seven
by
road
a
green
drive
bordered
by
hazels
and
sheltered
by
smooth
beeches
in
which
squirrels
were
playing
brought
him
to
the
house
a
melancholy
edifice
built
and
covered
with
plaster
that
had
once
been
painted
white
but
was
now
streaked
with
green
he
knocked
at
the
back
door
but
could
make
nobody
hear
a
dog
flew
out
of
a
kennel
near
the
yard
gate
tugging
at
his
chain
and
inside
the
house
two
others
excited
by
the
sound
came
pattering
along
the
passage
and
scraped
at
the
lower
edge
of
the
door
with
their
paws
abner
gave
it
up
evidently
nobody
was
at
home
he
took
a
drink
of
cold
water
at
the
pump
and
set
off
home
through
the
green
lane
down
it
he
heard
a
sound
of
muffled
hoofs
and
a
of
the
sturdy
kind
that
farmers
use
came
swinging
round
the
corner
the
driver
was
a
woman
of
to
thirty
years
of
age
swarthy
with
a
rich
autumnal
colouring
and
gray
eyes
another
younger
girl
with
her
hair
in
a
pigtail
sat
beside
her
they
passed
abner
at
a
trot
but
twenty
yards
later
the
driver
pulled
up
and
looked
back
have
you
been
up
to
the
dyke
she
called
yes
miss
said
abner
taking
off
his
cap
and
approaching
i
don
t
suppose
you
d
find
any
one
in
she
said
dad
s
gone
to
ludlow
and
the
girl
s
out
what
do
you
want
i
came
to
ask
if
mr
prosser
wants
any
outside
help
for
she
looked
at
him
steadily
their
eyes
met
i
don
t
know
what
s
your
name
fellows
abner
where
do
you
live
you
don
t
belong
to
these
parts
wolfpits
she
examined
him
more
closely
repeating
the
word
with
an
accent
of
surprise
she
put
a
finger
to
her
lip
i
think
dad
will
want
some
one
they
re
beginning
the
barley
on
monday
she
said
slowly
tell
you
what
you
d
better
look
up
here
morning
i
ll
tell
dad
you
re
coming
so
long
she
touched
up
the
horse
and
the
shot
forward
abner
went
on
his
way
encouraged
where
did
you
try
mary
asked
him
she
was
doing
her
utmost
to
appear
interested
in
his
quest
indeed
she
could
not
well
do
less
up
to
the
dyke
prosser
s
mary
blushed
did
you
see
any
one
there
the
place
was
all
shut
up
he
said
but
i
met
a
young
lady
as
i
took
to
be
mr
prosser
s
daughter
in
the
drive
just
after
i
turned
what
age
was
she
summat
about
dark
ah
darkish
there
was
a
young
un
along
with
how
was
she
dressed
now
you
m
asking
things
out
of
reason
abner
laughed
them
s
the
sort
of
things
a
man
don
t
it
must
have
been
marion
she
said
and
later
in
the
evening
she
explained
to
him
that
mr
prosser
s
elder
daughter
was
an
old
schoolfellow
of
hers
and
rather
more
than
a
schoolfellow
for
they
had
once
been
great
friends
mary
s
father
the
unfortunate
condover
had
been
something
of
a
crank
on
the
subject
of
education
and
had
sent
her
to
a
school
in
ludlow
where
she
had
mixed
with
all
sorts
of
people
who
were
in
fact
her
social
superiors
but
that
s
all
ages
ago
she
said
i
expect
that
she
s
forgotten
me
by
now
mr
prosser
lost
his
wife
five
or
six
years
ago
and
marion
s
had
charge
of
the
house
ever
since
then
a
great
big
place
the
dyke
she
s
a
queer
girl
i
ll
give
you
my
word
for
next
day
abner
went
up
early
to
the
farm
in
the
yard
he
found
the
younger
of
the
two
girls
she
was
dressed
in
a
holland
overall
and
a
big
straw
hat
and
was
watching
a
hatch
of
ducklings
that
an
anxious
hen
had
mothered
learning
to
swim
in
an
iron
bath
when
she
saw
abner
she
ran
into
the
house
calling
marion
marion
the
elder
came
to
the
door
abner
scarcely
recognised
her
for
she
had
changed
her
tweeds
and
her
sporting
hat
for
an
overall
like
that
of
her
sister
and
her
dark
hair
was
bound
in
thick
plaits
about
her
head
she
greeted
him
frankly
smiling
and
showing
between
her
parted
lips
a
set
of
beautiful
teeth
i
ve
told
dad
about
you
she
said
he
s
just
gone
over
to
have
a
look
at
the
bull
and
ll
be
back
in
a
minute
have
a
glass
of
cider
abner
thanked
her
she
returned
brightly
with
a
mug
of
cider
and
a
plate
of
scones
hot
from
the
girdle
five
minutes
later
mr
prosser
came
into
the
yard
with
his
ploughman
harris
the
farmer
was
a
tall
fair
man
with
golden
whiskers
and
a
moustache
that
almost
hid
the
weakness
of
his
mouth
h
m
you
re
the
young
man
are
you
he
said
looking
abner
up
and
down
with
more
curiosity
than
he
could
have
been
expected
to
show
for
a
casual
labourer
what
is
it
you
want
eh
abner
repeated
his
request
and
the
farmer
with
a
little
less
than
the
usual
surliness
of
his
kind
said
well
yes
i
dare
say
we
can
do
with
you
so
long
as
you
re
not
afraid
of
work
but
it
s
a
short
job
i
warn
you
the
younger
girl
who
had
been
listening
dreamily
to
their
conversation
turned
and
uttered
a
shrill
cry
dad
dad
she
said
i
m
afraid
i
ve
drowned
one
of
them
she
ran
forward
with
an
inanimate
piece
of
yellow
fluff
in
her
hand
oh
what
a
shame
that
s
like
you
ethel
the
father
grumbled
take
it
in
to
but
by
this
time
the
elder
sister
had
appeared
and
was
holding
the
duckling
to
her
breast
as
though
she
would
have
liked
to
nurse
it
back
to
life
ethel
stood
watching
her
with
tears
in
her
eyes
you
ll
never
make
a
farmer
s
wife
ethel
said
mr
prosser
teasing
her
come
here
give
us
a
kiss
he
held
the
child
s
face
in
his
hands
and
kissed
her
noisily
marion
had
carried
the
duckling
into
the
house
he
turned
to
abner
day
after
he
said
come
up
early
about
five
o
the
chapter
since
the
time
of
her
ludlow
schooldays
and
her
friendship
with
mary
condover
marion
prosser
s
horizon
had
widened
to
an
extent
that
might
easily
have
explained
the
distance
which
now
separated
them
from
ludlow
she
had
been
sent
on
to
finish
her
education
at
a
cheltenham
college
for
her
mother
had
social
ambitions
and
knew
that
the
nearest
way
to
the
homes
of
her
superiors
lay
through
the
schools
that
their
daughters
frequented
she
always
taught
marion
to
speak
of
her
father
as
a
a
description
which
mr
prosser
accepted
under
more
protest
than
he
usually
offered
to
anything
that
his
wife
dictated
for
all
that
he
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
the
dyke
had
belonged
to
his
family
for
six
generations
and
when
he
walked
round
his
fields
on
a
sunday
evening
and
surveyed
their
richness
from
the
crumbled
earthwork
of
offa
s
dyke
which
gave
the
farm
its
name
could
even
be
sentimental
on
the
subject
marion
went
to
cheltenham
when
her
sister
ethel
was
a
baby
two
years
old
she
made
many
friends
for
she
was
good
at
games
and
a
creature
of
unusual
spirit
but
the
principal
feature
of
her
life
was
a
sudden
and
passionate
friendship
for
one
of
her
mistresses
a
languid
young
woman
with
a
phthisical
tendency
who
made
her
read
a
good
deal
of
romantic
literature
of
a
sentimental
kind
miss
randall
s
literary
heroes
were
parsifal
and
galahad
and
her
fetish
personal
purity
the
purity
of
impotence
she
was
not
fond
of
men
she
said
although
she
allowed
herself
the
licence
of
a
spiritual
flirtation
with
an
advanced
young
priest
of
the
church
of
england
to
whom
she
opened
her
soul
in
due
course
marion
s
adoration
of
her
mistress
went
the
way
of
all
such
passions
but
her
taste
for
letters
remained
in
her
eighteenth
year
her
mother
suddenly
died
and
she
returned
to
the
dyke
to
look
after
her
father
and
her
baby
sister
even
in
the
excitement
of
her
new
activities
she
rebelled
feeling
herself
isolated
alien
condemned
to
an
infinity
of
she
became
the
hostess
of
her
father
s
friends
farmers
of
every
age
and
type
who
made
love
to
her
with
varying
degrees
of
rustic
clumsiness
but
seemed
to
mr
prosser
the
most
desirable
of
suitors
usually
they
drove
up
to
the
dyke
on
sunday
evenings
or
after
ludlow
market
some
by
their
liquorish
assumption
of
an
easy
conquest
offended
her
and
caught
the
rough
side
of
her
tongue
but
she
soon
found
that
with
them
her
genteel
shades
of
irony
were
so
much
waste
of
time
since
they
were
not
even
understood
the
young
men
retired
puzzled
and
their
sisters
sympathised
with
them
she
isn
t
natural
they
said
and
you
can
t
go
against
nature
like
that
i
never
could
think
what
you
saw
in
in
this
way
marion
prosser
got
a
reputation
for
shrewishness
and
conceit
the
young
men
of
the
neighbourhood
felt
that
even
the
possession
of
the
dyke
would
be
a
small
compensation
for
that
of
such
a
difficult
wife
they
began
to
treat
her
with
the
instinctive
respect
of
the
terrier
for
the
leaving
her
to
her
books
and
to
her
fancies
with
these
for
some
years
she
was
content
the
walls
of
her
bedroom
at
the
dyke
showed
evidences
of
culture
in
as
many
strata
as
can
be
found
in
the
coloured
ribbon
along
the
edge
of
a
geological
map
of
england
they
ranged
from
the
primary
rossettis
of
her
cheltenham
period
to
reproductions
of
late
impressionist
pictures
among
books
she
groped
her
way
determinedly
in
ludlow
she
found
a
branch
of
one
of
the
london
circulating
libraries
every
week
she
would
drive
there
in
her
pony
trap
and
bring
back
the
books
that
she
had
ordered
to
the
amazement
of
the
stationer
who
kept
the
shop
her
father
laughed
at
her
tastes
among
his
friends
she
gained
the
reputation
of
a
bluestocking
which
was
enough
to
make
any
young
man
think
twice
before
he
spoke
to
her
and
the
years
went
by
they
were
dull
years
and
for
very
boredom
she
tried
to
identify
herself
with
the
work
of
the
farm
she
threw
herself
violently
into
these
new
interests
to
the
amazement
of
her
father
although
he
was
still
more
than
a
little
afraid
of
her
he
could
not
help
respecting
her
capability
during
the
lifetime
of
her
mother
he
had
been
so
infused
with
the
spirit
of
this
active
woman
that
he
had
appeared
to
be
a
man
of
some
determination
her
death
annihilated
him
he
had
relapsed
into
nonentity
caring
nothing
as
it
seemed
for
his
crops
or
his
herds
driving
in
regularly
every
week
to
ludlow
market
like
an
automaton
driving
back
in
the
evening
morose
and
fuddled
with
no
clear
idea
of
what
he
had
been
about
on
these
occasions
he
would
talk
piteously
of
his
motherless
girls
and
his
large
sentimental
eyes
would
fill
with
tears
he
confided
to
his
friends
that
he
himself
was
not
long
for
this
world
though
physically
he
was
as
strong
as
a
horse
marion
s
determination
changed
all
that
subtly
without
his
knowledge
she
pulled
him
together
and
made
a
man
of
him
again
and
never
having
known
the
subjection
with
which
her
mother
had
entered
the
estate
of
marriage
she
did
what
she
liked
with
him
sometimes
wounding
his
pride
with
her
rather
brutal
frankness
yet
even
when
he
was
wounded
he
submitted
to
her
for
she
flattered
him
by
pretending
that
he
was
the
real
head
of
the
household
at
root
he
was
a
lazy
man
and
dared
not
quarrel
with
his
comforts
he
realised
too
that
the
knowledge
of
practical
farming
that
was
as
deeply
rooted
in
him
as
an
instinct
was
more
essential
to
the
success
of
their
partnership
than
marion
s
acute
and
active
mind
he
prospered
and
in
moments
of
exaltation
would
tell
himself
that
she
was
only
a
girl
after
all
and
that
he
was
the
man
who
counted
he
made
a
startling
recovery
of
his
and
talked
no
more
of
death
but
his
greatest
happiness
he
still
found
in
the
society
of
his
younger
daughter
ethel
a
child
whose
nature
was
nearer
to
his
own
some
day
he
decided
ethel
should
marry
a
solid
husband
of
his
choosing
some
big
man
with
many
lowland
acres
and
when
the
grandchildren
began
to
come
along
he
would
pass
a
quiet
old
age
among
them
marion
should
have
the
dyke
even
if
she
were
not
the
elder
she
had
earned
it
it
seemed
unlikely
that
she
would
ever
marry
being
so
hard
to
please
now
at
the
age
of
marion
found
herself
lonely
the
farm
work
had
become
so
intimate
a
part
of
her
life
that
it
served
no
longer
to
distract
her
life
was
slipping
away
from
her
ten
years
had
passed
almost
without
her
knowing
it
in
another
ten
she
would
be
nearly
forty
a
hidden
fear
possessed
her
that
by
separating
herself
from
her
own
class
and
kind
she
had
sacrificed
the
chance
of
living
life
was
the
thing
that
mattered
and
she
had
exchanged
her
heritage
for
a
few
pitiful
shreds
of
culture
the
motherly
cares
that
she
lavished
on
ethel
were
a
poor
substitute
for
veritable
maternity
and
she
knew
it
she
began
to
see
that
by
refusing
all
commerce
with
the
men
of
her
own
class
in
the
hope
of
realising
a
problematical
grand
passion
she
had
sacrificed
all
opportunity
of
passion
whatever
for
some
years
after
leaving
cheltenham
she
had
exchanged
letters
with
a
number
of
her
college
friends
but
little
by
little
this
correspondence
had
grown
more
slender
and
at
length
it
had
ceased
in
her
growing
apprehension
she
made
an
attempt
to
revive
several
of
these
ancient
friendships
the
result
filled
her
with
despair
and
vague
envies
most
of
her
girl
friends
were
married
many
of
them
sent
her
photographs
of
their
husbands
and
children
she
alone
it
seemed
of
all
their
company
was
left
alone
it
was
her
own
fault
she
knew
it
was
her
own
fault
for
her
mirror
told
her
that
she
did
not
show
her
age
and
that
she
was
still
desirable
all
things
seemed
to
conspire
in
fostering
her
unrest
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
great
farm
around
her
were
full
of
insistence
on
the
cycle
of
birth
fruitfulness
and
decay
her
books
helped
her
no
more
her
old
æsthetic
idols
had
long
since
been
broken
and
her
latest
passion
whitman
whom
she
had
discovered
through
the
anthologies
swamped
her
mind
with
an
endless
adoration
of
the
body
s
pride
the
splendour
of
the
flower
no
less
than
that
of
the
fruiting
in
this
distressful
and
desirous
state
two
incidents
moved
her
deeply
the
first
was
the
dismissal
of
one
of
the
farm
girls
who
had
been
seduced
by
a
clogger
and
had
gone
into
the
workhouse
to
have
her
baby
she
was
a
puny
undesirable
creature
with
neither
beauty
nor
health
yet
she
had
found
a
lover
the
second
was
the
scandal
of
mary
malpas
her
old
school
friend
and
the
young
lodger
at
wolfpits
rehearsed
with
many
winks
by
mr
williams
whom
her
father
had
brought
in
for
a
glass
of
whisky
on
a
sunday
evening
a
well
chap
that
fellows
said
williams
to
her
father
it
s
no
great
wonder
she
s
took
a
fancy
to
well
well
tis
the
way
of
the
world
said
mr
prosser
comfortably
fill
mr
williams
s
glass
marion
she
did
so
and
then
furiously
blushing
left
the
room
what
s
up
with
your
maid
williams
asked
i
reckon
i
ve
shocked
her
did
i
say
anything
out
of
the
way
not
you
she
s
a
rum
un
is
marion
mr
prosser
laughed
and
a
few
days
later
she
had
met
abner
returning
from
his
fruitless
visit
to
the
dyke
she
had
looked
at
him
standing
in
the
level
sunshine
and
seen
that
he
was
but
when
she
pulled
up
her
horse
and
emerged
from
the
dream
state
into
which
the
rhythm
of
trotting
hoofs
had
thrown
her
she
had
not
thought
that
this
meeting
would
be
different
from
any
other
with
a
labourer
out
of
work
she
liked
abner
s
face
and
for
this
reason
had
taken
the
trouble
to
ask
him
where
he
lived
then
came
the
word
wolfpits
and
a
sudden
realisation
that
fellows
was
the
name
that
mr
williams
had
mentioned
in
his
scandalous
tale
it
thrilled
her
to
find
herself
face
to
face
with
mary
s
lover
she
lowered
her
eyes
not
daring
to
look
at
him
and
all
the
time
her
soul
was
consumed
with
a
curiosity
to
see
more
of
him
to
find
out
what
he
was
like
she
knew
that
this
curiosity
was
dangerous
that
she
was
deliberately
courting
temptation
but
she
had
had
enough
of
prudence
and
felt
that
she
was
old
enough
to
look
after
herself
and
yet
she
knew
that
she
had
done
a
momentous
thing
when
she
told
him
to
call
next
morning
at
the
dyke
and
feared
that
trouble
indefinite
trouble
might
come
of
it
abner
had
not
been
working
three
days
on
the
farm
when
harris
his
principal
labourer
told
mr
prosser
who
the
new
workman
was
young
mrs
malpas
s
fancy
man
he
called
him
and
mr
prosser
who
set
great
store
on
the
respectability
of
his
farm
felt
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
employing
him
the
matter
had
been
settled
by
marion
no
doubt
if
she
had
known
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
she
would
not
have
taken
him
on
do
you
know
who
this
young
chap
is
marion
he
asked
yes
he
comes
from
do
you
realise
that
he
s
the
chap
williams
was
talking
about
the
one
that
s
living
with
mary
malpas
yes
i
do
mr
williams
himself
said
he
didn
t
blame
i
thought
you
yourself
were
put
out
a
bit
by
his
mentioning
put
out
of
course
i
wasn
t
why
should
i
be
put
out
i
think
it
s
bringing
the
scandal
rather
near
home
having
him
he
s
a
good
workman
isn
t
he
i
don
t
think
there
s
anything
wrong
with
him
that
well
that
s
all
you
want
to
harris
doesn
t
speak
well
of
harris
is
jealous
of
every
one
who
sets
foot
in
the
place
you
d
think
he
owned
and
what
ll
the
vicar
say
he
joked
i
don
t
know
nor
care
but
i
m
sure
we
re
doing
right
to
employ
him
i
don
t
know
what
would
happen
to
poor
mary
with
that
malpas
in
jail
and
this
man
out
of
well
i
suppose
you
know
best
said
mr
prosser
he
had
not
expected
marion
to
take
the
matter
up
so
warmly
and
abner
stayed
he
was
not
long
in
finding
out
who
was
the
real
ruler
of
the
dyke
and
that
mr
prosser
for
all
his
commanding
figure
stood
for
nothing
when
the
men
knocked
off
for
their
dinner
at
midday
and
the
two
girls
came
down
the
field
carrying
baggins
of
bread
and
cheese
and
great
jugs
of
harvest
beer
they
would
wink
at
each
other
and
say
here
comes
the
boss
marion
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
him
more
than
a
word
but
her
eyes
were
conscious
of
him
and
he
always
felt
that
he
was
working
under
her
scrutiny
whenever
they
spoke
together
he
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
was
she
who
had
got
him
his
job
and
that
she
could
take
it
away
from
him
as
easily
when
he
came
back
from
his
work
at
night
mary
would
ask
him
questions
about
her
old
friend
but
he
could
never
satisfy
her
does
she
know
that
you
come
from
here
she
would
say
of
course
she
knows
i
told
her
at
the
but
she
s
never
mentioned
me
never
asked
after
me
we
ve
never
spoke
ten
words
it
s
funny
that
when
you
come
to
think
of
her
and
me
having
slept
in
the
same
bed
she
must
know
about
me
she
s
a
rum
un
miss
marion
there
s
no
getting
away
from
he
and
mary
never
saw
much
of
each
other
in
those
days
for
abner
had
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
in
time
for
his
seven
mile
walk
and
the
harvest
labour
was
severe
severe
and
yet
pleasant
for
the
summer
weather
held
and
no
rain
fell
the
sun
shone
pitilessly
on
the
whitening
stubbles
but
the
of
the
dyke
were
so
lifted
upon
the
back
of
the
hills
that
they
seemed
to
be
part
of
a
high
cloudland
and
free
from
all
heaviness
on
the
lower
levels
the
whir
of
reaping
machines
might
be
heard
but
higher
up
the
fields
were
so
unlevel
following
the
broken
contour
of
the
hills
and
bounded
by
the
sloping
ramparts
of
the
dyke
that
all
the
reaping
must
be
done
with
sickles
and
the
dry
shocks
carried
to
the
head
of
a
rough
road
abner
had
not
the
skill
to
wield
a
sickle
and
so
in
this
part
of
the
labour
he
was
useless
harris
the
labourer
who
acted
as
foreman
when
mr
prosser
was
not
in
the
fields
resented
this
before
marion
s
interest
in
the
farm
began
he
had
been
his
master
s
man
he
had
been
present
at
the
time
when
abner
was
first
employed
by
mr
prosser
and
knowing
that
the
newcomer
was
a
protégé
of
miss
marion
s
was
naturally
jealous
when
the
men
sat
in
the
shade
of
a
hedgerow
for
lunch
he
grumbled
to
his
mates
and
grudged
abner
his
share
of
the
food
the
two
casual
labourers
were
inclined
to
take
harris
s
side
but
old
avery
a
man
of
sixty
who
had
worked
at
the
dyke
all
his
life
stood
up
for
abner
i
don
t
know
what
the
place
is
coming
to
harris
said
we
don
t
want
no
navvies
here
there
s
too
many
about
as
it
is
tis
a
farming
man
s
job
reaping
i
reckon
you
re
one
of
miss
marion
s
fancies
you
d
a
better
look
out
the
men
laughed
and
abner
asked
him
what
the
hell
he
meant
harris
was
a
customer
for
all
his
years
strong
as
a
bull
with
a
low
forehead
hair
and
long
ungainly
arms
that
seemed
to
have
been
bowed
by
the
carrying
of
trusses
of
hay
you
know
what
i
mean
he
said
and
i
ll
tell
you
another
thing
we
don
t
want
no
bleedin
outsiders
here
snatching
the
bread
out
of
our
violence
would
surely
have
followed
but
at
the
most
dangerous
moment
the
farmer
and
his
daughters
arrived
the
reaping
of
the
field
was
almost
finished
a
huge
expanse
of
stubble
lay
gleaming
under
the
sun
and
crackled
with
heat
in
the
midst
of
the
field
a
square
of
barley
stood
unreaped
and
shimmering
and
within
it
cowered
a
secret
multitude
of
hares
and
rabbits
that
the
destruction
of
their
homes
had
driven
inwards
mr
prosser
and
marion
carried
guns
and
ethel
was
playing
with
three
dogs
that
sniffed
and
trembled
with
eagerness
for
this
annual
pastime
of
slaughter
now
harris
let
s
get
a
move
on
said
the
farmer
the
horses
that
had
stood
stamping
and
swishing
their
tails
and
flicking
flies
from
their
ears
in
the
shade
of
an
were
brought
round
with
cries
of
encouragement
and
the
machine
rolled
clanking
over
the
stubble
towards
the
standing
corn
prosser
and
his
daughters
stayed
behind
in
the
hedgerow
the
day
s
work
went
on
and
as
the
square
diminished
narrowing
with
each
turn
of
the
machine
the
dogs
sniffed
along
the
edge
of
that
narrow
sanctuary
until
the
guns
were
ready
give
miss
marion
a
hand
with
her
loading
fellows
prosser
shouted
tell
the
men
to
get
their
sticks
ready
harris
and
we
ll
put
the
dogs
in
on
the
far
abner
and
marion
stood
together
with
the
sun
beating
on
their
backs
the
dogs
ran
barking
into
the
corn
above
them
in
the
eye
of
the
sun
a
kestrel
hovered
three
frightened
rabbits
bolted
from
the
farther
edge
prosser
fired
two
barrels
and
killed
one
another
was
wounded
and
harris
ran
after
it
with
ungainly
strides
and
stick
uplifted
he
brought
down
the
stick
with
a
savage
cry
and
dashed
out
the
animal
s
brains
i
got
him
the
varmint
he
shouted
the
multitude
within
the
square
of
corn
trembled
one
by
one
terror
drove
them
out
into
the
open
marion
fired
twice
and
missed
her
hands
shook
as
she
gave
the
gun
to
abner
to
reload
she
could
not
see
her
pitiful
target
she
saw
nothing
but
the
young
man
at
her
side
with
his
hair
his
red
chest
and
neck
and
the
skin
above
the
roll
of
his
shirt
sleeves
quick
you
m
missing
of
them
he
cried
she
fired
again
and
missed
she
could
hit
nothing
i
don
t
know
what
s
the
matter
with
me
she
said
i
think
i
ve
been
too
long
in
the
sun
you
d
better
take
the
gun
and
she
stood
watching
the
sureness
of
his
aim
as
he
fired
knocking
over
the
pitiful
furry
creatures
one
by
one
she
watched
him
fascinated
conscious
only
of
his
health
and
strength
and
the
perfect
of
his
body
she
saw
it
as
that
of
her
friend
s
lover
and
in
a
yearning
tenderness
she
thought
of
that
hidden
life
away
in
wolfpits
she
could
stand
it
no
longer
give
me
the
gun
she
said
don
t
shoot
any
she
took
the
weapon
from
him
and
went
over
to
join
her
sister
in
the
hedge
where
she
sat
watching
the
scene
of
slaughter
in
a
dream
then
she
got
up
suddenly
telling
ethel
that
the
sun
was
too
much
for
her
and
went
straight
home
to
her
bedroom
all
afternoon
she
lay
on
her
bed
in
the
green
light
of
a
venetian
blind
her
eyes
burned
and
her
head
was
splitting
but
she
knew
that
this
was
not
altogether
because
of
the
sun
later
when
she
had
bathed
her
eyes
in
cold
water
and
done
her
hair
she
pulled
out
an
old
album
in
which
there
was
a
photograph
taken
at
the
ludlow
school
where
mary
malpas
had
been
her
friend
it
was
a
group
ranged
round
the
central
figures
of
the
two
precise
spinsters
who
kept
the
academy
she
and
mary
condover
were
standing
side
by
side
two
solemn
childish
faces
with
eyes
staring
straight
at
the
photographer
now
mary
condover
was
mary
malpas
and
had
this
man
for
a
lover
over
in
the
secrecy
of
wolfpits
they
loved
ethel
came
knocking
at
the
door
with
a
cup
of
tea
the
sound
of
her
knock
made
marion
jump
it
was
not
like
her
to
be
nervous
they
ve
counted
the
rabbits
said
ethel
that
s
two
more
than
last
year
dad
s
ever
so
pleased
is
your
headache
better
yes
i
m
all
right
said
marion
i
ll
be
down
in
a
for
several
days
she
saw
next
to
nothing
of
abner
one
morning
however
her
father
sent
him
up
to
her
with
a
message
she
was
making
pastry
in
the
kitchen
her
hands
and
arms
were
white
with
flour
and
the
heat
of
the
range
had
flushed
her
face
again
she
found
that
in
his
presence
she
lost
her
and
falling
on
an
awkward
silence
she
blurted
out
well
how
does
it
suit
you
well
enough
he
replied
thanks
to
you
oh
don
t
thank
she
said
with
a
laugh
he
was
going
but
she
called
him
back
to
the
kitchen
door
don
t
you
find
the
walk
to
wolfpits
rather
tiring
she
asked
it
s
a
fair
step
he
said
but
i
don
t
take
much
count
of
why
don
t
you
stay
up
here
till
harvest
s
over
she
said
you
could
make
up
some
sort
of
a
bed
in
the
he
thanked
her
but
refused
i
find
a
good
bit
to
do
when
i
get
home
nights
he
said
they
can
t
get
on
in
the
house
without
they
she
said
with
a
laugh
ah
well
it
won
t
be
for
while
they
were
speaking
together
at
the
door
harris
passed
them
with
his
basket
slung
over
his
stooping
shoulders
he
touched
his
cap
to
marion
and
gave
abner
a
wry
smile
as
he
passed
marion
returned
to
the
kitchen
without
another
word
and
abner
on
his
way
back
to
the
field
began
to
puzzle
his
head
as
to
what
she
had
meant
by
her
sudden
change
of
front
when
he
had
excused
himself
from
sleeping
at
the
dyke
the
scorn
that
she
had
put
into
her
repetition
of
the
word
they
made
him
think
that
perhaps
there
was
more
justification
than
he
had
imagined
in
mary
s
feeling
of
resentment
against
marion
prosser
but
if
she
felt
sore
with
mary
for
any
reason
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
practise
on
him
he
wasn
t
going
to
be
lugged
in
to
any
petty
feminine
quarrel
they
might
be
sure
of
that
he
had
quite
enough
to
do
on
his
own
keeping
even
with
that
leering
devil
harris
mr
harris
was
going
to
cop
it
one
of
these
days
and
no
mistake
he
dismissed
marion
prosser
from
his
mind
and
yet
all
through
the
hot
harvest
season
the
two
of
them
were
meeting
and
passing
with
a
sense
of
something
desired
but
unspoken
on
the
part
of
marion
and
whenever
they
met
there
came
into
abner
s
mind
a
grudging
recognition
of
her
physical
presence
he
decided
that
he
did
not
like
this
strong
dark
almost
boyish
creature
who
without
even
speaking
could
so
thrust
herself
upon
his
consciousness
she
was
too
secret
for
him
he
wished
that
she
would
speak
out
what
she
had
to
say
so
that
they
might
know
where
they
were
and
be
finished
with
it
and
since
she
would
not
do
so
he
avoided
her
meanwhile
the
harvest
season
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
later
crops
were
marred
by
the
rain
from
every
corner
of
the
uplands
came
the
same
story
straw
so
weak
as
to
be
worthless
and
wheat
sprouting
in
the
ear
prosser
who
could
well
stand
these
losses
and
many
more
picked
up
an
infection
of
grumbling
at
the
ludlow
market
ordinary
not
only
were
the
standing
crops
ruined
but
the
extra
hands
were
eating
their
heads
off
harris
echoed
his
lamentations
and
abner
together
with
the
two
other
outsiders
who
had
been
engaged
for
the
harvest
would
have
been
paid
off
but
for
the
intervention
of
marion
he
knew
nothing
of
this
through
all
that
dead
wet
season
when
the
baked
steamed
with
rain
and
morning
skies
were
heavy
with
autumnal
mist
he
busied
himself
with
odd
jobs
about
the
farm
it
was
important
for
him
if
he
were
to
find
work
in
the
neighbourhood
when
the
job
at
the
dyke
was
over
that
he
should
learn
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
s
craft
he
learned
to
milk
to
brush
the
horses
and
to
bed
them
down
helped
with
the
lifting
of
the
potatoes
and
dug
them
into
the
immense
buries
shaped
like
the
barrows
of
the
on
castel
ditches
in
which
they
were
stored
for
winter
then
sudden
unheralded
came
a
september
summer
the
mists
disappeared
the
drowned
crops
stood
up
golden
in
a
hot
and
level
sunshine
the
work
of
the
fields
began
again
they
laboured
incessantly
for
the
sunshine
and
drought
were
now
more
precious
than
gold
they
worked
so
hard
from
the
light
of
dawn
until
the
stunted
sheaves
threw
gigantic
shadows
that
there
was
no
room
in
his
mind
for
the
foibles
of
marion
or
the
growing
jealousy
of
harris
prosser
and
his
girls
came
down
into
the
fields
to
aid
them
the
sheaves
ripened
against
time
and
prosser
watched
the
sky
and
tapped
his
glass
all
day
long
he
held
on
as
long
as
he
dared
but
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
drought
the
glass
began
to
fall
and
the
last
sheaves
were
carted
from
the
fields
by
moonlight
at
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
they
knocked
off
exhausted
and
strangely
happy
in
the
consciousness
of
a
work
well
done
but
the
sense
of
happiness
departed
from
abner
as
he
walked
home
through
the
twilight
for
he
knew
that
the
job
at
the
dyke
was
over
and
he
had
nothing
else
before
him
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
supposed
he
would
draw
his
money
and
be
faced
with
a
new
search
for
employment
next
day
in
accordance
with
the
ancient
custom
of
the
dyke
a
harvest
home
was
held
in
the
long
kitchen
of
the
house
all
morning
marion
her
sister
and
agnes
the
maid
were
busy
baking
cakes
and
boiling
hams
for
the
festival
the
wives
and
children
of
the
labourers
were
asked
to
share
in
these
rejoicings
and
more
than
twenty
usually
sat
down
to
the
long
table
at
night
abner
and
the
other
extra
hands
were
expected
to
come
but
mary
malpas
was
not
invited
abner
saw
nothing
strange
or
pointed
in
the
omission
and
indeed
he
had
no
time
to
spare
for
ceremonies
of
this
kind
having
been
bred
in
a
country
where
feudal
customs
had
long
since
died
away
under
the
new
and
harder
influence
of
capitalism
but
to
the
labourers
at
the
dyke
and
particularly
to
older
men
such
as
daniel
avery
the
harvest
home
was
a
feast
as
religious
as
any
ancient
mystery
to
them
it
was
the
crown
of
the
year
and
its
labours
more
vital
and
more
significant
than
any
convention
of
the
calendar
mr
prosser
as
a
member
of
the
older
generation
was
himself
attached
to
the
custom
it
reminded
him
of
his
boyhood
of
the
days
when
his
father
was
master
of
the
dyke
and
his
grandfather
sat
watching
the
dances
from
the
chimney
corner
and
in
this
way
it
comforted
him
with
a
sense
of
continuity
and
flattered
those
vestiges
of
family
pride
which
were
the
deepest
elements
in
his
nature
the
day
always
found
him
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
marion
who
loved
to
see
her
father
made
happy
even
by
the
simplest
things
caught
a
little
of
his
joyful
infection
the
house
was
in
a
stir
the
servants
laughed
and
sang
about
their
work
the
oaken
dresser
was
spread
with
holiday
fare
marion
caught
old
avery
in
the
yard
and
made
him
promise
to
sing
his
s
song
if
i
do
sing
it
i
mun
sing
it
right
through
said
the
old
man
with
a
wink
i
can
t
mind
the
verses
without
i
sing
them
in
she
laughed
for
many
of
his
verses
were
indecent
you
shall
sing
just
what
you
like
dan
she
said
as
well
quarrel
with
the
indecency
of
the
bible
as
that
of
avery
s
songs
mr
prosser
had
told
the
men
to
leave
their
work
at
five
o
clock
instead
of
at
six
in
order
that
they
might
go
home
to
clean
themselves
and
fetch
their
families
only
hayes
the
cowman
who
slept
on
the
premises
was
to
be
left
behind
abner
old
avery
and
harris
set
off
down
the
drive
together
the
others
moved
too
slowly
for
abner
for
he
had
seven
miles
in
front
of
him
all
day
long
harris
had
taken
a
malicious
pleasure
in
letting
abner
know
that
his
time
was
up
and
that
the
dyke
would
soon
be
shut
of
him
there
had
been
one
or
two
ugly
moments
softened
by
the
good
humour
of
old
dan
now
they
walked
alongside
in
silence
abner
setting
the
pace
hey
you
do
go
too
fast
for
old
bones
my
son
said
avery
wants
to
get
home
to
his
missus
said
harris
here
you
d
better
drop
that
said
abner
warningly
but
harris
would
not
be
warned
he
knew
as
well
as
the
others
that
mary
malpas
had
not
been
invited
to
the
dyke
i
reckon
you
m
going
to
leave
her
behind
he
said
i
reckon
you
d
better
mind
your
own
business
i
ve
had
a
damn
sight
too
much
of
your
harris
laughed
stands
to
reason
they
won
t
have
that
kind
of
muck
in
the
company
of
decent
married
women
and
innocent
childer
he
said
abner
did
not
wait
to
answer
him
he
let
out
with
his
right
catching
harris
on
the
temple
and
sent
him
spinning
toward
the
ditch
steady
lad
steady
cried
old
avery
harris
pulled
himself
together
and
made
straight
for
abner
with
his
head
low
down
like
a
bull
he
was
the
older
man
and
in
spite
of
the
iron
strength
of
his
arms
abner
always
had
the
advantage
harris
fought
desperately
with
his
boots
as
well
as
his
fists
they
fought
till
their
faces
were
bloody
and
their
clothes
torn
old
avery
whined
at
them
to
give
over
but
they
took
no
notice
of
him
at
last
abner
drove
harris
into
the
ditch
where
he
lay
spluttering
blood
i
reckon
that
ll
teach
you
to
keep
your
bleedin
mouth
shut
said
abner
savagely
and
left
him
there
with
the
old
man
trembling
and
shedding
weak
tears
above
him
he
washed
in
the
folly
brook
and
had
made
himself
fairly
presentable
by
the
time
he
reached
wolfpits
i
thought
you
were
going
to
the
harvest
home
said
mary
then
you
thought
wrong
said
abner
irritably
give
us
some
neither
harris
nor
his
family
turned
up
at
the
dyke
that
evening
old
dan
who
had
kept
his
own
counsel
was
in
the
middle
of
his
song
when
one
of
the
ploughman
s
children
came
in
with
a
message
to
say
that
her
dad
was
in
a
fever
and
the
bed
wringing
wet
under
him
why
didn
t
your
mother
come
prosser
asked
dad
wouldn
t
let
her
said
the
child
marion
took
her
aside
and
gave
her
a
piece
of
cake
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
prosser
grumbled
here
s
harris
badly
and
now
hayes
tells
me
he
s
got
a
poisoned
finger
i
don
t
know
what
we
ll
do
for
the
milking
there
s
fellows
said
marion
yes
it
s
lucky
we
ve
got
him
why
he
isn
t
here
either
what
the
devil
s
the
matter
with
them
all
marion
said
nothing
she
had
guessed
long
ago
why
abner
was
not
there
she
had
half
suspected
that
he
would
not
come
to
the
dyke
without
mary
but
her
pride
would
not
let
her
ask
her
father
to
invite
the
family
from
wolfpits
in
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
doubted
if
she
would
dare
to
meet
her
old
friend
it
would
be
so
difficult
and
besides
that
she
felt
that
the
intuitions
of
the
other
woman
might
discover
her
own
leaning
toward
abner
it
was
too
dangerous
next
morning
abner
arrived
at
his
usual
hour
during
the
night
dr
hendrie
had
been
summoned
to
the
dyke
and
had
found
that
the
neglected
splinter
in
the
cowman
s
finger
threatened
him
with
and
the
loss
of
his
arm
at
dawn
mr
prosser
had
driven
him
in
to
the
infirmary
at
shrewsbury
marion
received
abner
on
his
arrival
why
didn
t
you
come
up
last
night
she
said
that
sort
of
thing
bain
t
much
in
my
line
he
replied
i
wanted
you
to
come
she
said
he
only
smiled
awkwardly
and
she
wished
that
she
had
been
more
prudent
she
told
him
that
hayes
was
in
hospital
and
that
harris
was
laid
up
with
influenza
it
would
be
a
convenience
to
them
if
he
could
take
over
hayes
s
work
which
was
the
care
and
milking
of
the
cows
and
the
driving
of
morning
and
night
to
llandwlas
station
he
was
astonished
at
this
turn
of
luck
for
he
had
expected
to
be
dismissed
with
his
harvest
earnings
in
his
pocket
for
all
that
he
didn
t
mean
to
take
the
job
on
false
pretences
so
harris
has
caught
the
influenza
has
he
he
said
yes
he
sent
up
his
little
girl
with
a
message
last
well
said
he
it
wasn
t
true
what
harris
got
was
a
damned
good
hammering
from
that
he
won
t
she
thrilled
to
hear
him
in
her
eyes
he
had
become
a
hero
she
knew
already
that
he
could
be
gentle
it
gave
her
a
curious
almost
physical
pleasure
to
realise
him
as
a
fighting
man
for
every
one
in
the
district
was
aware
of
harris
s
iron
strength
tell
me
what
happened
she
said
he
only
got
what
he
asked
for
said
abner
with
his
dirty
talk
about
young
mrs
mary
malpas
she
said
quickly
oh
i
m
sick
of
hearing
her
she
did
not
pass
on
to
her
father
what
abner
had
told
her
he
came
back
from
shrewsbury
that
evening
tired
and
depressed
the
doctors
reckon
that
we
were
only
just
in
time
with
poor
hayes
he
said
it
s
a
near
shave
for
his
left
arm
they
ve
had
to
open
it
right
up
to
the
shoulder
and
he
ll
be
lucky
if
he
s
out
of
hospital
by
christmas
i
don
t
know
what
we
can
do
with
harris
ill
as
there
s
fellows
she
said
yes
there
s
fellows
he
repeated
thinking
of
other
things
he
stared
at
her
vaguely
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
eyes
were
searching
her
and
she
left
him
blushing
abner
s
new
work
kept
him
almost
exclusively
on
the
farm
premises
and
for
this
reason
he
and
marion
often
crossed
each
other
s
paths
they
met
so
often
that
marion
lost
a
little
of
her
shame
in
speaking
with
him
she
handled
him
cleverly
so
that
in
the
end
he
lost
a
good
deal
of
the
awkwardness
that
she
herself
had
created
she
was
frank
and
kind
helping
him
in
many
small
things
he
came
to
take
her
for
granted
and
even
to
like
her
in
a
little
time
he
became
accustomed
to
the
cowman
s
job
and
took
a
pride
in
it
to
all
intents
and
purposes
he
was
his
own
master
for
the
dairy
was
marion
s
province
and
mr
prosser
rarely
interfered
with
its
management
within
a
week
of
his
hammering
harris
returned
apparently
not
much
the
worse
for
it
nobody
but
old
avery
knew
what
had
happened
and
the
ploughman
kept
to
himself
a
story
that
was
hardly
flattering
abner
had
been
prepared
to
treat
him
friendlily
but
he
soon
saw
that
harris
had
no
intention
of
doing
the
same
maintaining
a
surly
silence
that
was
never
to
be
broken
since
their
work
now
lay
in
different
directions
so
autumn
passed
the
first
frosts
of
winter
whitened
the
upland
and
the
first
ploughing
began
abner
kept
to
his
own
work
the
prossers
dairy
was
a
small
one
for
their
pasture
land
was
limited
but
he
found
that
with
the
two
station
deliveries
the
milking
and
the
care
of
the
cows
his
hands
were
pretty
full
he
saw
less
and
less
of
wolfpits
for
it
had
been
arranged
that
he
should
take
his
evening
meal
at
the
farm
on
his
return
from
the
station
and
mary
was
not
altogether
sorry
for
this
since
it
freed
her
from
many
embarrassing
moments
abner
was
now
earning
a
good
wage
and
the
household
was
relatively
prosperous
he
was
even
able
to
replace
the
watch
that
had
been
stolen
at
bran
in
this
peaceful
interlude
the
only
thing
that
really
disquieted
mary
s
mind
was
george
s
letter
she
had
never
yet
dared
to
show
it
to
abner
but
she
had
not
destroyed
it
and
from
time
to
time
a
cruel
fascination
compelled
her
to
take
it
from
the
drawer
where
she
had
hidden
it
and
to
read
it
again
it
seemed
strange
to
her
that
she
had
received
no
other
word
from
him
if
he
could
write
once
he
could
surely
write
again
and
though
she
did
not
dare
to
confide
its
contents
to
mrs
mamble
she
induced
the
old
woman
to
question
the
wife
of
a
policeman
at
lesswardine
whom
she
had
attended
in
a
confinement
as
to
the
conditions
under
which
a
prisoner
in
the
county
jail
might
receive
visitors
or
write
letters
a
prisoner
in
george
s
condition
mrs
mamble
told
her
was
entirely
separated
from
the
outside
world
for
the
first
three
months
of
his
sentence
after
that
if
his
conduct
were
good
he
might
write
and
receive
one
letter
every
month
and
invite
one
visitor
to
see
him
during
the
same
period
this
knowledge
amazed
her
for
george
had
now
been
in
jail
more
than
nine
months
but
had
only
written
her
this
one
disturbing
letter
and
had
never
once
asked
her
to
visit
him
the
fact
filled
her
with
an
inexplicable
pang
of
jealousy
but
what
troubled
her
more
deeply
was
to
know
that
mrs
mamble
was
conscious
of
her
humiliation
the
less
you
think
about
him
the
better
said
the
old
woman
stoutly
he
was
never
no
good
to
you
and
never
will
but
mary
could
not
put
the
matter
out
of
her
mind
once
again
she
commissioned
mrs
mamble
to
make
inquiries
in
chapel
green
and
find
out
if
old
mrs
malpas
had
visited
george
in
prison
the
answer
was
definite
mrs
malpas
had
never
left
the
village
since
the
day
of
the
trial
although
she
had
received
several
letters
from
george
as
the
postman
who
lodged
with
one
of
mrs
mamble
s
friends
could
vouch
then
mary
hardened
her
heart
for
she
guessed
that
george
was
choosing
for
his
only
visitor
the
widow
woman
from
lesswardine
whom
she
had
seen
at
the
trial
george
s
letter
she
burned
with
anger
what
right
had
he
to
dictate
to
her
how
she
should
behave
her
soul
was
full
of
hatred
and
contempt
so
that
she
almost
wished
that
she
had
given
him
real
cause
for
suspicion
in
this
state
she
allowed
her
memory
to
dwell
with
tenderness
on
the
surprising
moment
that
had
come
to
her
and
abner
by
the
pool
she
felt
that
she
had
been
foolish
to
shrink
from
it
and
yet
she
dared
not
let
abner
see
what
she
was
thinking
knowing
for
certain
that
if
she
did
so
something
violent
and
terrible
must
happen
to
them
for
herself
she
had
no
fear
but
the
thought
of
what
the
children
might
suffer
chilled
her
and
she
released
her
surfeit
of
feeling
in
a
more
passionate
devotion
to
these
small
creatures
determining
whatever
might
happen
to
hold
on
for
the
remaining
eight
months
of
george
s
imprisonment
this
artificial
resolution
made
her
harden
herself
more
than
ever
against
abner
one
day
mrs
mamble
brought
her
the
news
that
susan
hind
was
being
married
in
less
than
a
week
to
badger
the
keeper
she
now
saw
so
little
of
abner
that
she
could
not
be
sure
that
his
old
relations
with
susie
had
ceased
but
she
found
herself
snatching
eagerly
at
an
occasion
for
wounding
him
i
hope
you
re
going
to
your
old
friend
s
wedding
abner
she
said
i
don
t
know
nothing
about
one
he
said
i
ve
no
friends
in
these
parts
that
i
know
susie
hind
she
s
marrying
mr
badger
next
she
watched
him
carefully
well
he
s
welcome
said
abner
with
a
laugh
and
then
instead
of
being
relieved
she
found
herself
overwhelmed
by
a
new
suspicion
he
would
not
have
spoken
like
that
unless
he
had
been
entangled
with
some
other
woman
she
wondered
who
it
could
be
and
a
few
days
later
began
to
ply
him
with
deliberate
questions
about
marion
prosser
he
did
not
guess
what
she
was
driving
at
imagined
that
she
was
still
brooding
over
her
old
slight
i
know
naught
about
her
he
said
do
you
like
her
any
better
than
you
did
i
don
t
mind
her
said
abner
at
any
rate
she
don
t
werrit
me
with
questions
about
one
day
in
october
marion
renewed
her
proposal
that
abner
should
sleep
at
the
dyke
she
told
him
that
she
didn
t
like
to
think
of
him
walking
to
and
from
wolfpits
every
day
if
she
had
substituted
mary
malpas
for
wolfpits
she
would
have
been
nearer
to
the
truth
we
can
make
you
quite
comfortable
in
the
little
loft
above
the
she
said
there
s
no
point
in
your
wearing
yourself
he
said
nothing
but
told
mary
of
her
proposal
listening
she
held
her
breath
i
don
t
want
to
keep
you
she
compelled
herself
to
say
you
d
better
no
fear
said
he
you
don
t
catch
me
losing
my
liberty
that
way
a
man
that
sleeps
over
his
work
s
no
better
than
a
she
felt
a
sudden
relief
yes
you
re
quite
right
she
said
i
m
sure
you
re
she
spoke
as
if
it
were
the
matter
of
principle
that
interested
her
next
day
he
refused
marion
s
offer
and
she
left
him
in
a
huff
she
was
miserable
for
she
could
not
overcome
the
attraction
which
he
had
exercised
over
her
from
the
first
yet
was
too
bashful
to
declare
herself
more
openly
she
tried
to
tell
herself
that
abner
was
only
a
labouring
man
and
her
inferior
in
station
but
she
could
not
pretend
that
physically
he
was
not
her
equal
nor
deny
his
influence
she
hoped
that
he
would
notice
the
change
in
her
attitude
see
that
she
was
avoiding
him
and
perhaps
miss
her
but
he
went
on
with
his
work
as
usual
and
did
not
seem
to
care
whether
she
came
near
him
or
sent
him
messages
by
ethel
or
agnes
the
maid
and
so
gradually
with
a
feeling
of
shame
she
was
driven
back
to
his
company
the
days
were
now
drawing
in
rapidly
and
it
was
after
sunset
when
the
cows
came
to
be
milked
it
had
been
marion
s
custom
to
carry
the
scoured
pails
to
the
byre
and
stand
by
abner
s
side
while
he
milked
when
he
drove
the
cows
into
the
shed
he
would
light
a
stable
lantern
and
hang
it
from
a
nail
in
the
wall
before
he
found
his
stool
and
took
the
pail
from
her
hands
these
were
the
moments
when
she
felt
herself
nearest
to
him
standing
in
the
doorway
of
the
shippon
she
would
watch
him
as
he
sat
with
his
fair
head
pressed
to
the
cows
flanks
and
listen
to
the
milk
swishing
into
the
pails
it
was
a
moment
of
most
soothing
silence
neither
of
them
spoke
nor
was
there
any
other
sound
but
that
of
the
cows
snatching
hay
from
the
racks
above
them
with
their
lips
and
filling
the
shed
with
their
sweet
breath
marion
stood
very
still
in
that
quietude
and
thither
like
shadows
came
the
cats
that
lived
in
the
lofts
and
roofs
of
the
granary
shy
creatures
it
was
part
of
abner
s
ritual
to
set
a
tin
basin
of
milk
on
the
floor
for
them
and
round
this
they
would
walk
five
or
six
of
them
with
sidelong
gait
and
tails
uplifted
every
night
at
they
came
but
if
she
stirred
a
muscle
they
were
gone
she
watched
them
quiet
hallucinated
and
when
they
were
gone
she
stayed
on
in
the
silence
while
abner
strained
the
milk
into
her
scalded
buckets
and
passed
from
stall
to
stall
one
evening
she
found
him
troubled
i
don
t
half
like
the
look
of
daisy
here
he
said
daisy
was
a
red
devon
cow
the
only
one
of
her
breed
in
prosser
s
herd
of
herefords
some
weeks
before
she
had
calved
but
the
calf
had
been
feeble
and
had
died
and
though
they
had
given
her
a
stuffed
with
straw
to
lick
she
had
pined
and
the
milk
had
failed
in
quality
now
she
stood
miserably
in
her
stall
with
her
ears
turned
back
and
her
sleek
coat
staring
why
what
s
wrong
with
her
marion
asked
she
was
coughing
a
good
bit
when
i
drove
her
to
have
no
heart
in
her
you
can
see
she
s
breathing
quicker
than
the
others
you
put
your
ear
to
her
and
hearken
it
s
like
a
lot
of
bubbles
going
off
inside
of
he
put
his
arm
over
the
animal
s
neck
and
listened
marion
did
as
he
told
her
they
listened
together
but
she
could
hear
nothing
but
abner
s
own
deep
placid
breath
he
seemed
very
near
to
her
she
could
see
his
serious
eyes
shining
with
of
her
heart
began
to
beat
so
violently
that
she
feared
he
must
hear
it
she
felt
a
choking
sensation
in
her
breast
as
though
her
heart
was
bursting
and
she
must
cry
out
or
weep
it
was
intolerable
do
you
catch
it
he
asked
yes
i
hear
she
said
i
reckon
she
s
worse
than
she
seemed
said
abner
i
think
she
s
got
the
bronchitis
you
d
best
let
the
gaffer
he
s
gone
down
to
craven
arms
for
the
sales
she
replied
he
s
booked
a
bed
at
the
railway
like
our
luck
abner
grumbled
well
we
d
better
give
her
a
drench
of
gruel
and
poultice
her
when
we
ve
finished
the
when
he
came
back
from
the
station
she
was
ready
with
a
draught
of
oatmeal
gruel
then
she
set
herself
to
making
a
poultice
of
linseed
meal
and
brought
it
out
to
him
i
reckon
i
can
t
leave
her
he
told
her
hadn
t
we
better
send
for
harris
she
asked
he
flared
up
at
once
harris
i
don
t
want
that
harris
poking
his
nose
in
my
shippon
very
well
she
said
mildly
she
watched
him
adjust
the
poultice
over
daisy
s
throat
the
animal
was
now
coughing
painfully
and
the
chill
of
the
night
air
seemed
to
strangle
her
breathing
marion
found
it
difficult
to
leave
him
there
s
no
call
for
you
to
go
catching
your
death
of
cold
abner
said
again
she
submitted
but
i
think
we
d
better
take
turns
with
her
she
said
i
ll
go
and
tell
she
left
him
and
though
she
could
not
persuade
him
to
let
her
take
his
place
she
returned
from
time
to
time
to
the
byre
he
scarcely
spoke
to
her
for
the
animal
s
condition
made
him
more
and
more
anxious
at
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
she
came
out
in
her
with
her
dark
hair
braided
down
her
back
for
the
night
the
cow
was
now
a
terrible
sight
she
had
sunk
down
upon
the
floor
of
the
shed
and
was
breathing
in
desperate
quick
gasps
with
her
brown
eyes
piteously
upturned
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
her
said
abner
not
we
shall
have
to
send
for
harris
he
understands
them
she
said
all
right
he
returned
grudgingly
i
ll
send
agnes
down
to
the
village
and
then
i
ll
bring
you
some
don
t
you
worry
about
that
agnes
is
making
it
she
sent
the
maid
running
off
at
once
the
kitchen
fire
was
nearly
out
and
the
kettle
would
not
boil
it
seemed
to
her
an
age
before
she
could
get
it
boiling
then
she
filled
a
jug
with
tea
and
prepared
to
take
it
to
him
at
the
door
a
shadow
startled
her
and
she
gave
a
cry
abner
was
standing
on
the
step
it
s
a
bad
job
he
said
she
s
gone
she
went
off
quite
she
did
not
realise
what
he
was
saying
she
gave
a
nervous
laugh
oh
what
a
start
you
gave
me
she
said
putting
down
the
jug
on
the
table
and
then
suddenly
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
started
sobbing
hysterically
don
t
take
on
like
that
he
said
it
s
no
fault
of
oh
it
s
not
that
she
cried
it
s
not
that
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
trying
to
soothe
her
and
the
next
moment
she
was
clinging
in
his
arms
and
he
was
covering
her
face
and
neck
with
kisses
harris
who
had
run
up
from
his
cottage
as
fast
as
he
could
travel
stood
panting
and
gazing
at
them
in
the
doorway
but
neither
abner
nor
marion
saw
him
and
when
he
had
stared
at
them
for
a
moment
he
moved
quietly
across
the
yard
into
the
byre
the
chapter
when
mr
prosser
returned
from
craven
arms
next
evening
he
was
in
a
bad
temper
at
the
railway
hotel
on
the
night
before
he
had
fallen
in
with
a
number
of
cattle
dealers
from
north
bromwich
and
manchester
he
had
drunk
more
than
he
could
stand
and
had
sat
up
playing
cards
in
the
commercial
room
till
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
losing
the
price
of
a
bullock
in
the
process
marion
who
met
him
at
llandwlas
station
told
him
that
the
devon
cow
had
died
in
the
night
died
said
he
what
do
you
mean
died
she
was
all
right
fellows
says
it
was
bronchitis
it
was
awful
to
see
her
bronchitis
they
don
t
die
that
quick
with
bronchitis
what
the
hell
does
fellows
know
about
it
he
couldn
t
have
done
more
than
he
did
she
replied
he
sat
up
with
her
till
she
i
ve
never
known
such
an
unlucky
year
he
grumbled
hayes
s
wife
says
that
he
won
t
be
out
of
hospital
for
another
month
or
more
fellows
means
well
enough
but
he
s
not
like
an
experienced
he
sat
broodily
in
the
trap
for
a
few
moments
why
didn
t
you
send
for
harris
he
asked
at
length
we
did
but
daisy
died
before
he
could
get
i
shall
advertise
for
a
cowman
he
said
with
a
show
of
determination
that
gave
him
a
better
opinion
of
himself
fellows
did
his
best
it
wasn
t
his
what
do
you
know
about
it
anyway
said
mr
prosser
roughly
reaching
the
dyke
in
the
worst
of
tempers
he
had
not
even
time
to
give
ethel
the
kiss
for
which
she
stood
waiting
he
went
straight
into
the
and
mixed
himself
a
stiff
whisky
and
water
then
feeling
masterful
and
businesslike
he
went
straight
out
into
the
fields
to
look
for
harris
he
found
him
driving
in
his
team
from
the
plough
did
you
see
daisy
last
night
he
asked
yes
i
see
d
her
but
not
afore
she
was
wellnigh
how
did
she
come
to
go
off
sudden
like
that
eh
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
thinks
mr
prosser
i
ll
tell
you
that
cow
she
died
of
violent
neglect
i
ve
had
my
eye
on
her
some
days
then
why
the
devil
didn
t
you
say
so
me
and
fellows
don
t
speak
to
one
another
and
you
was
gone
off
to
the
why
didn
t
you
tell
miss
marion
then
it
s
no
good
talking
to
miss
marion
about
he
her
wouldn
t
hear
a
word
against
fellows
though
he
be
no
more
fit
to
look
after
cows
than
rabbits
and
i
know
for
harris
shook
his
head
knowingly
what
do
you
mean
by
that
why
don
t
you
speak
plain
and
i
will
speak
plain
mr
prosser
though
i
don
t
know
where
your
eyes
have
been
if
you
haven
t
seed
it
for
yourself
miss
marion
s
soft
on
that
fellows
and
he
knows
it
and
takes
advantage
on
prosser
gave
an
uneasy
laugh
you
don
t
get
me
to
believe
that
he
said
you
can
believe
it
or
not
gaffer
said
harris
it
s
all
the
same
to
me
i
m
only
telling
you
of
what
i
knows
and
what
i
ve
seen
with
my
own
eyes
when
daisy
was
dying
that
fellows
was
in
your
own
kitchen
and
the
two
of
them
kissing
one
another
so
took
up
they
never
saw
me
coming
and
that
s
the
truth
as
i
m
standing
here
prosser
could
only
stare
at
him
you
ought
to
have
known
the
name
that
chap
has
with
women
there
s
mr
hind
s
daughter
over
at
the
pound
house
there
s
george
malpas
s
wife
not
counting
those
that
was
never
found
out
he
s
a
proper
young
bull
that
fellows
and
no
mistake
the
farmer
left
him
in
a
fury
he
found
marion
laying
the
in
the
ethel
was
crouched
by
the
fire
reading
a
book
of
you
go
out
into
the
kitchen
ethel
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
i
m
so
comfy
here
dad
said
the
child
sleepily
do
as
you
re
bid
he
shouted
and
ethel
frightened
left
the
room
you
ve
scared
her
said
marion
she
s
not
used
to
being
spoken
to
like
no
said
he
and
it
ld
be
better
for
the
both
of
you
if
you
were
just
you
put
those
things
down
and
tell
me
the
truth
about
what
do
you
mean
father
she
asked
i
ve
told
you
he
did
all
he
could
he
sat
up
with
and
that
s
a
damned
lie
to
start
with
sat
up
with
her
did
he
sat
up
spooning
in
the
kitchen
along
with
you
that
s
more
like
it
she
blushed
then
straightened
herself
and
faced
him
with
her
hands
clasped
before
her
he
was
almost
frightened
of
her
burning
eyes
who
told
you
that
she
said
quietly
never
you
mind
who
told
me
they
that
told
me
saw
it
with
their
own
eyes
saw
you
behaving
like
a
labourer
s
girl
in
a
hedge
that
s
a
fine
thing
to
come
to
you
deny
it
if
you
can
i
m
not
going
to
deny
it
she
said
then
you
ve
no
shame
left
in
you
thank
god
your
poor
mother
hasn
t
lived
to
see
it
i
never
thought
to
hear
a
daughter
of
mine
speak
like
that
he
waited
for
her
to
defend
herself
but
she
stood
as
though
petrified
cold
with
a
furnace
of
emotions
flaming
inside
her
he
took
her
by
the
arm
roughly
and
shook
her
don
t
dad
she
whispered
here
tell
me
how
far
it
s
she
wouldn
t
answer
him
you
d
better
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
how
long
has
it
been
going
on
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
you
eh
better
tell
me
straight
the
implication
affronted
her
modesty
for
though
she
had
fearfully
imagined
physical
passion
and
its
admonitions
had
found
their
way
into
her
dreams
the
least
suggestion
of
crudity
shocked
her
her
father
s
words
made
her
want
to
cover
her
face
for
shame
her
resolution
wavered
in
a
piercing
moment
of
revelation
she
saw
the
scene
in
which
she
was
taking
a
part
the
hard
tasteless
room
with
its
steel
engravings
of
sporting
pictures
and
its
furniture
the
coarse
cutlery
that
she
had
been
putting
on
the
table
the
metallic
ticking
bronze
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
the
worn
hearthrug
and
in
front
of
her
the
angry
flushed
face
of
her
father
the
face
of
a
man
inflamed
by
passion
and
the
prejudices
of
his
class
and
she
saw
herself
a
farmer
s
daughter
in
a
print
overall
discovered
shamed
in
a
gross
affair
with
a
labouring
man
how
many
times
in
the
history
of
the
countryside
had
the
same
scene
been
enacted
how
many
women
of
her
kind
had
been
pestered
with
the
same
urgent
questions
and
still
he
pressed
her
what
s
done
can
t
be
mended
better
tell
me
straight
my
girl
all
her
suppressed
idealism
rose
in
revolt
against
him
against
her
surroundings
against
her
whole
manner
of
life
she
hated
her
father
and
utterly
despised
him
i
won
t
have
you
talking
to
me
like
that
she
said
i
m
not
a
child
and
you
shan
t
treat
me
like
one
i
m
a
woman
i
m
nearly
thirty
do
you
think
a
woman
can
go
on
living
this
miserable
separated
life
and
settle
down
into
an
old
maid
like
aunt
isabel
without
feeling
anything
no
people
like
you
don
t
think
that
a
woman
should
have
any
feelings
you
think
as
long
as
you
re
well
fed
and
get
your
glass
of
whisky
at
night
and
all
your
books
kept
up
to
date
you
think
that
s
enough
life
for
a
woman
you
think
that
it
s
a
privilege
for
her
to
spend
her
days
looking
after
you
do
you
think
a
woman
never
wants
a
man
prosser
gasped
i
think
you
ve
taken
leave
of
your
senses
marion
he
said
i
ve
a
life
to
live
as
well
as
you
she
cried
you
call
yourself
a
farmer
but
you
ve
no
more
idea
of
nature
she
could
say
no
more
but
threw
her
hands
wide
in
a
gesture
of
despair
it
slowly
dawned
on
him
that
she
was
defending
herself
he
saw
himself
shamed
among
his
fellows
there
had
never
been
a
scandal
at
the
dyke
in
his
time
he
said
good
god
good
god
then
helped
himself
to
another
glass
of
whisky
and
took
a
stiff
gulp
well
i
never
thought
it
of
you
was
all
he
could
say
he
poured
out
another
tot
a
sudden
gust
of
anger
swept
over
marion
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
she
picked
up
the
whisky
decanter
and
sent
it
crashing
into
the
fire
the
flames
roared
up
the
chimney
blue
tongues
of
lighted
spirit
ran
out
over
the
hearthrug
marion
my
god
you
re
mad
he
cried
you
ll
set
the
house
afire
what
do
you
think
you
re
doing
he
snatched
a
rug
from
the
sofa
and
went
down
on
his
knees
stifling
the
flame
she
burst
out
into
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
laughter
he
stared
at
her
frightened
what
are
you
laughing
at
he
cried
i
don
t
know
she
said
weakly
i
felt
i
must
break
something
what
an
awful
mess
the
outburst
had
sobered
her
and
more
than
that
the
sight
of
her
father
s
scared
and
innocent
face
it
s
all
right
now
she
said
i
ll
fetch
a
cloth
from
the
he
looked
so
bewildered
that
she
couldn
t
help
laughing
at
him
i
m
damned
if
i
can
make
you
out
he
said
of
course
you
can
t
you
ve
not
the
least
idea
then
it
s
all
right
he
said
solemnly
the
dawning
relief
in
his
face
was
too
much
for
her
she
knelt
down
on
the
carpet
beside
him
and
kissed
his
head
oh
dad
you
re
too
killing
she
said
do
you
think
i
can
t
look
after
myself
well
thank
heaven
for
that
was
all
he
could
say
they
talked
the
matter
out
more
soberly
that
evening
over
the
embers
of
the
fire
when
ethel
had
been
sent
off
to
bed
they
were
as
happy
in
each
other
s
company
and
as
tender
as
lovers
who
have
quarrelled
and
made
it
up
again
the
moment
of
vision
had
faded
for
ever
the
room
in
which
they
sat
had
regained
its
old
familiarity
in
marion
s
eyes
forcing
itself
to
be
accepted
as
her
home
mr
prosser
was
no
longer
a
coarse
man
with
more
than
a
drop
of
whisky
in
him
but
the
father
whom
she
had
always
known
the
sombre
life
of
the
dyke
with
its
slow
rich
comfort
was
the
life
to
which
she
had
been
born
and
she
considered
what
would
be
the
effect
on
that
life
of
her
marrying
abner
fellows
for
if
her
father
s
suspicions
had
been
justified
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
he
would
have
compelled
the
lover
to
make
an
honest
woman
of
her
no
happiness
worth
the
daring
lay
in
that
direction
she
knew
that
she
could
hope
for
nothing
but
a
continual
clashing
of
the
two
men
s
wills
and
herself
a
buffer
between
them
her
father
had
a
long
memory
for
his
hates
there
could
never
be
any
peace
in
the
house
till
he
died
rather
than
submit
to
such
a
humiliation
she
would
cut
herself
free
from
the
dyke
and
share
abner
s
life
love
in
a
cottage
with
a
vengeance
but
did
he
love
her
she
had
no
real
reason
to
believe
it
and
did
she
love
him
she
could
not
say
better
far
better
cling
to
the
certainties
whatever
they
might
be
we
ll
say
no
more
about
it
said
mr
prosser
let
bygones
be
bygones
eh
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
at
the
fire
a
piece
of
the
shattered
decanter
that
had
escaped
her
brush
suddenly
caught
a
gleam
of
light
it
meant
no
more
to
her
now
than
a
flake
of
the
s
flint
of
the
kind
that
she
and
ethel
found
on
their
picnics
at
castel
ditches
of
course
fellows
must
go
said
mr
prosser
i
reckon
i
can
find
another
man
by
the
end
of
the
yes
marion
murmured
at
the
end
of
the
luckily
there
s
no
scarcity
of
labour
said
mr
prosser
happily
marion
s
thoughts
turned
idly
to
wolfpits
she
shut
the
idea
of
wolfpits
out
of
her
mind
it
was
wrong
she
thought
that
mary
malpas
should
ever
have
come
again
into
her
life
it
was
always
wrong
to
uncover
the
past
they
sat
for
a
long
time
in
silence
she
crouched
on
the
floor
at
her
father
s
side
and
his
arm
was
thrown
carelessly
over
her
shoulder
his
head
nodded
and
he
fell
asleep
but
marion
still
stared
into
the
embers
seeing
nothing
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
mr
prosser
woke
with
a
start
and
rubbed
his
eyes
i
think
i
must
have
dropped
off
he
said
why
look
at
the
clock
he
kissed
her
by
the
way
he
said
i
saw
young
fred
maddy
over
at
craven
arms
he
talked
about
riding
over
for
tea
sunday
he
s
doing
pretty
well
is
fred
maddy
since
his
father
he
stood
blinking
at
her
curiously
but
she
made
him
no
reply
will
you
put
out
the
light
in
the
kitchen
dad
and
see
to
the
doors
she
said
next
morning
when
he
had
listened
to
abner
s
own
version
of
daisy
s
death
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
in
contemplation
of
the
carcass
mr
prosser
told
him
without
offering
any
explanation
that
he
would
not
be
wanted
at
the
dyke
after
the
end
of
the
week
abner
took
it
for
granted
that
the
loss
of
the
cow
explained
his
dismissal
it
was
a
piece
of
bad
luck
and
no
more
was
to
be
said
for
it
the
blow
was
a
heavy
one
for
he
had
felt
that
his
position
on
the
farm
was
secure
and
that
the
fortunes
of
wolfpits
were
safe
for
the
winter
he
would
have
to
begin
his
search
for
work
all
over
again
and
this
at
a
time
when
the
demand
for
labour
was
at
its
lowest
what
made
him
particularly
savage
was
the
look
of
triumph
that
he
now
saw
on
harris
s
face
no
doubt
the
ploughman
had
managed
to
put
a
word
in
against
him
with
mr
prosser
well
a
man
who
had
taken
such
a
hammering
as
harris
got
on
the
night
of
the
harvest
home
had
a
right
to
get
his
own
back
particularly
when
fortune
had
given
his
enemy
a
trip
what
puzzled
abner
more
was
the
strangeness
of
marion
s
attitude
he
did
not
attach
any
great
importance
to
her
breakdown
in
the
farm
kitchen
and
the
tender
moment
that
followed
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
might
happen
with
any
woman
but
he
did
find
it
rather
shabby
of
her
to
abandon
him
as
soon
as
he
was
down
on
his
luck
for
he
had
always
felt
that
she
was
his
friend
and
supporter
and
knew
indeed
that
he
had
owed
his
job
to
her
from
the
beginning
still
he
believed
that
it
was
in
keeping
with
even
more
with
feminine
kick
a
man
when
he
was
down
the
school
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
had
left
him
with
few
romantic
illusions
so
instead
of
brooding
over
her
defection
he
went
on
steadily
with
his
work
until
the
day
of
his
departure
on
the
last
evening
they
met
for
one
moment
only
she
came
into
the
byre
at
and
took
up
her
old
station
in
the
doorway
watching
him
as
he
worked
he
looked
round
and
found
her
standing
there
it
was
too
dark
for
him
to
see
her
face
she
handed
him
the
pails
in
silence
and
when
he
had
finished
and
stood
wiping
his
hands
on
his
trousers
she
said
almost
timidly
this
is
the
last
yes
he
said
and
i
m
sorry
to
i
m
sorry
too
she
said
though
she
could
not
be
sure
that
she
was
speaking
the
truth
you
ve
been
a
great
help
to
he
gave
an
uneasy
laugh
if
that
old
daisy
hadn
t
gone
and
catched
cold
he
said
where
are
you
going
she
asked
abruptly
that
s
a
hard
one
to
answer
he
said
i
wish
i
could
help
she
found
it
difficult
to
speak
without
wounding
his
delicacy
if
you
re
in
want
of
money
at
any
time
she
felt
it
was
her
duty
to
give
him
anything
she
possessed
it
was
necessary
for
her
own
that
she
should
not
feel
under
any
obligation
to
him
money
s
no
use
to
me
he
said
falling
back
on
one
of
mick
connor
s
characteristic
phrases
but
if
ever
you
re
in
need
she
persisted
i
know
that
mrs
malpas
and
her
children
are
dependent
on
it
was
the
second
time
that
she
had
ever
mentioned
mary
s
name
she
compelled
herself
to
do
so
now
because
in
this
way
she
could
make
it
quite
clear
that
the
incident
of
the
other
night
was
forgotten
and
that
he
could
not
build
on
it
she
wanted
to
clear
herself
at
any
price
even
as
she
spoke
the
consciousness
of
her
own
motives
filled
her
with
shame
she
held
out
her
hand
you
won
t
forget
that
will
you
she
said
no
miss
marion
you
ve
been
a
good
friend
to
and
he
took
her
hand
in
his
his
unexpected
use
of
the
respectful
prefix
emboldened
her
and
made
her
feel
surer
of
herself
in
a
moment
the
indefiniteness
of
the
situation
had
gone
they
were
back
on
their
old
footing
of
servant
and
mistress
her
heart
gave
a
leap
of
thankfulness
she
felt
that
she
was
saved
the
man
whose
rough
hand
her
fingers
now
touched
for
a
moment
was
no
longer
the
symbol
of
an
ideal
but
simply
a
whom
her
father
had
dismissed
she
withdrew
her
own
hand
hurriedly
i
ll
say
then
she
said
miss
and
thank
ee
said
abner
and
touched
his
cap
the
idea
of
leaving
the
dyke
had
shocked
him
but
when
he
passed
down
the
drive
for
the
last
time
with
prosser
s
money
in
his
pocket
abner
experienced
a
sudden
feeling
of
relief
it
was
probable
that
hard
times
were
ahead
of
him
and
yet
he
had
never
felt
so
free
since
the
day
when
he
left
his
father
s
house
at
halesby
when
he
got
home
he
told
mary
with
an
affectation
of
lightness
that
he
had
got
the
sack
her
first
impulse
was
one
of
fear
for
their
finances
but
almost
as
quickly
she
found
herself
thankful
that
abner
was
no
longer
in
touch
with
marion
prosser
the
world
in
which
she
and
marion
had
been
friends
was
so
far
behind
and
spoke
to
her
so
poignantly
of
a
lost
content
that
she
was
glad
to
be
wholly
freed
from
it
she
could
not
disguise
the
fact
that
she
was
jealous
of
marion
not
only
for
this
but
for
other
reasons
she
put
on
a
bold
and
heartening
front
i
ve
a
nice
bit
of
money
in
hand
she
said
that
shows
how
wise
we
were
to
go
her
show
of
cheerfulness
and
courage
pleased
him
i
thought
it
d
put
you
out
a
bit
he
said
we
ought
to
be
used
to
uncertainty
by
this
time
she
replied
i
m
glad
you
won
t
have
that
long
walk
there
and
back
it
was
enough
to
take
the
strength
out
of
any
it
s
a
rum
thing
he
said
but
i
don
t
mind
it
any
more
than
you
do
leaving
the
you
must
get
a
job
nearer
home
now
she
said
you
re
quite
a
ay
i
ll
have
a
look
round
he
said
when
the
day
came
he
had
not
the
heart
to
set
out
in
quest
of
work
instead
of
doing
so
he
lounged
all
morning
and
after
dinner
took
the
children
out
for
a
long
walk
over
the
stark
wintry
fields
they
were
wildly
excited
to
go
with
him
for
it
was
now
many
months
since
they
had
known
such
a
holiday
mary
watched
them
smiling
as
they
left
wolfpits
she
saw
that
they
were
happy
and
marvelled
at
her
own
happiness
abner
and
the
children
made
their
way
through
the
silent
larchwoods
to
the
top
of
castel
ditches
and
sat
there
gazing
idly
down
upon
the
river
valleys
about
the
time
when
cohorts
of
starlings
wheeled
through
the
sky
above
the
of
the
barbel
where
they
made
their
nightly
roosting
place
the
three
of
them
dropped
down
the
slope
towards
the
waterworks
there
abner
found
a
diminished
gang
still
working
on
the
last
details
of
the
track
the
sidings
the
cranes
and
the
engines
were
gone
and
in
place
of
the
trenches
on
which
abner
had
worked
a
year
before
he
now
saw
trim
walls
culverts
and
bridges
of
stone
a
single
wooden
hut
remained
standing
and
there
he
found
the
gunner
rubbing
his
hands
over
a
bucket
of
coke
he
stared
at
abner
as
though
he
were
a
stranger
well
our
abner
he
cried
when
he
recognised
him
how
goes
it
i
thought
you
d
left
these
parts
long
ago
what
have
you
been
up
to
up
at
the
dyke
abner
told
him
that
s
a
poor
game
said
the
gunner
shaking
his
head
don
t
i
know
it
said
abner
i
ve
just
finished
with
it
can
t
you
give
us
a
job
here
no
my
son
nor
any
one
else
said
the
gunner
we
re
just
clearing
up
like
i
ve
got
ten
men
of
the
old
gang
left
but
in
another
week
we
shall
have
finished
the
lot
don
t
you
imagine
i
m
sorry
for
it
either
i
ve
had
enough
of
mainstone
to
last
me
for
a
well
i
ve
got
to
get
a
job
somehow
said
abner
then
you
won
t
get
it
here
this
place
is
dead
my
son
and
that
s
the
truth
you
d
best
get
back
to
dear
old
brum
or
coventry
that
s
the
place
for
you
everybody
s
going
mad
on
these
here
the
same
as
they
did
on
bicycles
coventry
s
your
ticket
he
gave
the
children
a
apple
apiece
abner
bade
him
and
turned
homewards
did
you
hear
about
our
wedding
at
the
pound
house
the
foreman
shouted
after
him
whisky
you
could
have
swum
in
it
pity
old
mick
wasn
t
it
was
dusk
when
abner
reached
wolfpits
he
began
his
quest
for
a
new
job
hopefully
undeterred
by
the
foreman
s
warning
or
the
still
gloomier
prophecies
of
old
man
drew
he
knew
that
work
was
scarce
at
that
season
but
it
could
not
well
be
scarcer
than
it
had
been
when
he
found
continued
employment
at
the
dyke
abner
felt
that
luck
would
come
to
him
in
much
the
same
unexpected
way
his
first
attempts
seemed
full
of
promise
at
the
time
when
he
had
set
out
canvassing
before
he
had
always
been
received
with
a
kind
of
negative
pessimism
that
he
learned
to
consider
as
the
normal
attitude
toward
life
of
the
border
farmer
now
he
noticed
that
the
and
particularly
the
women
listened
to
his
applications
with
more
interest
remembered
his
name
asked
him
questions
about
himself
and
even
appeared
to
regard
his
person
with
curiosity
he
took
this
as
a
good
sign
but
though
he
was
encouraged
his
hopes
came
no
nearer
to
realisation
one
after
another
the
local
farmers
or
their
wives
heard
his
story
had
a
good
look
at
him
and
turned
him
down
the
reason
for
their
interest
was
not
far
to
seek
in
spite
of
mr
prosser
s
anxiety
to
keep
dark
the
true
cause
of
abner
s
dismissal
and
the
scandal
that
it
implied
harris
the
ploughman
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
of
making
public
his
enemy
s
discomfiture
and
though
nobody
dared
to
whisper
to
the
principal
actors
in
the
comedy
that
they
knew
what
had
happened
the
whole
story
of
marion
prosser
s
infatuation
for
her
father
s
cowman
went
the
rounds
of
the
neighbourhood
at
ludlow
market
it
passed
for
a
good
tale
against
prosser
who
was
envied
for
his
possessions
and
marion
whose
aloofness
had
made
her
unpopular
in
the
most
frequent
version
of
the
story
abner
had
been
caught
out
with
marion
in
the
byre
at
a
time
when
that
astute
young
woman
had
arranged
for
her
father
to
stay
the
night
at
craven
arms
for
his
health
s
sake
marion
it
was
said
had
refused
for
the
most
pressing
of
reasons
to
give
her
cowman
up
but
prosser
s
family
been
so
deeply
wounded
that
he
had
threatened
to
shoot
the
fellow
on
the
spot
and
let
his
daughter
s
name
go
hang
the
men
enjoyed
the
joke
against
prosser
the
women
were
agreed
that
proud
creatures
such
as
marion
usually
found
their
own
level
by
some
such
violent
means
the
principal
question
of
interest
that
remained
was
where
marion
would
go
to
hide
her
shameful
condition
in
every
stratum
of
local
society
from
that
of
lesswardine
court
to
that
of
the
mrs
badger
at
the
pentre
the
incident
was
discussed
but
nobody
in
the
district
heard
it
with
more
triumph
and
satisfaction
than
old
mrs
malpas
of
the
buffalo
by
this
time
the
whole
village
was
so
used
to
her
vilifications
of
mary
that
they
were
scarcely
taken
seriously
for
village
opinion
even
when
it
is
censorious
in
expression
is
as
a
rule
charitable
in
deed
now
that
she
found
herself
armed
with
a
new
enormity
to
reinforce
the
old
she
set
herself
steadily
to
the
task
of
making
it
impossible
for
abner
to
find
work
she
determined
to
drive
him
out
of
the
district
for
in
this
way
she
knew
that
mary
and
her
children
must
undergo
the
suffering
that
they
deserved
and
that
abner
s
devotion
had
spared
them
with
incredible
patience
she
made
it
her
business
to
interview
every
farmer
within
five
miles
of
lesswardine
and
to
beg
him
or
failing
him
his
wife
to
refuse
employment
to
such
a
scandalous
character
the
wesleyan
minister
at
chapel
green
who
regarded
mrs
malpas
as
one
of
the
principal
pillars
of
his
church
helped
her
in
this
and
only
the
laziness
of
the
vicar
of
mainstone
prevented
his
wife
from
making
him
a
party
to
the
same
plan
abner
in
his
ignorance
was
faced
by
a
deliberate
boycott
the
men
who
spoke
him
fairly
when
he
asked
them
for
work
were
prepared
to
see
him
and
the
family
that
he
supported
starve
before
they
gave
it
to
him
for
a
whole
month
this
business
went
on
when
first
abner
began
to
look
for
work
mary
had
greeted
him
every
evening
with
enquiring
eyes
now
she
no
longer
dared
ask
him
what
had
happened
during
the
day
the
monotony
of
unfulfilled
promises
told
on
him
he
began
to
avoid
her
society
and
to
shrink
from
that
of
the
children
trying
to
exhaust
his
strength
with
long
walks
afield
and
cutting
wood
for
mrs
mamble
and
old
drew
as
well
as
for
their
own
household
she
pitied
him
with
all
her
heart
but
dared
not
show
him
pity
lest
it
should
tax
his
courage
too
heavily
money
was
running
short
she
starved
herself
in
order
that
he
and
the
children
might
not
lack
and
thus
found
herself
dragged
into
a
vicious
circle
for
her
sacrifice
lessened
her
own
resistance
and
made
her
temper
uneven
and
liable
to
be
irritated
by
abner
s
moroseness
they
did
not
speak
of
their
troubles
but
neither
of
them
could
see
what
the
end
would
be
wolfpits
in
its
utter
isolation
was
the
last
place
in
the
district
that
rumour
ever
reached
it
was
five
weeks
after
abner
had
left
the
dyke
when
mrs
mamble
heard
the
cause
of
abner
s
dismissal
and
whispered
it
to
mary
in
a
normal
state
she
might
have
borne
it
but
her
exhaustion
made
her
an
easy
prey
to
jealousy
one
evening
abner
found
her
unusually
pale
and
speechless
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
with
her
i
ve
only
just
heard
the
truth
she
said
scarcely
controlling
her
passion
what
about
he
asked
innocently
about
why
you
left
the
dyke
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
i
did
tell
you
you
know
as
well
as
i
you
never
said
a
word
about
marion
not
one
word
who
s
been
putting
that
rubbidge
into
your
head
said
abner
angrily
rubbish
she
repeated
you
can
call
it
that
now
but
if
you
d
left
the
girl
alone
we
shouldn
t
be
where
we
are
now
not
knowing
where
to
look
for
a
shilling
and
the
children
likely
to
want
for
you
ve
got
a
maggot
in
your
head
missus
he
said
why
i
left
the
dyke
s
got
nothing
to
do
with
miss
marion
so
don
t
you
think
oh
i
m
tired
of
you
she
cried
it
s
no
use
your
telling
off
your
lies
to
me
i
m
dead
sick
of
you
and
your
women
you
and
your
susie
hinds
and
marion
prossers
running
after
loose
women
with
your
eyes
shut
and
never
a
thought
for
those
that
keep
themselves
decent
like
me
and
if
there
was
another
caught
your
eye
you
d
be
up
and
away
after
her
the
same
you
re
no
better
than
an
animal
like
the
rest
of
men
they
re
all
the
same
she
stood
up
to
him
trembling
with
rage
at
that
moment
she
was
ugly
and
rising
to
the
violence
of
her
challenge
he
hated
her
he
lost
sight
of
her
weakness
all
he
saw
was
her
impudent
provocation
an
answering
anger
fumed
up
into
his
head
and
carried
him
away
so
that
he
could
easily
have
struck
her
he
came
towards
her
with
his
hand
lifted
don
t
don
t
she
shrieked
in
terror
he
dropped
his
hand
and
walked
straight
out
of
the
room
left
alone
she
was
overborne
with
shame
for
what
she
had
done
and
cried
for
her
lost
dignity
never
in
her
life
had
she
so
abased
herself
but
he
lied
to
me
he
lied
to
me
she
told
herself
if
he
hadn
t
lied
to
me
it
wouldn
t
have
happened
little
by
little
the
turmoil
of
her
thoughts
abated
and
she
began
to
remember
his
goodness
his
patience
all
that
she
owed
to
him
if
he
had
struck
me
she
thought
i
should
have
deserved
she
almost
wished
that
his
hand
had
fallen
for
nothing
less
than
a
blow
could
have
justified
her
violence
and
her
base
ingratitude
the
only
thing
with
which
she
could
comfort
herself
was
a
firm
determination
that
she
would
never
offend
him
again
by
nothing
but
the
most
complete
sacrifice
of
her
feelings
could
she
repay
him
a
thousandth
part
of
what
she
owed
him
after
that
day
she
never
uttered
one
complaint
though
the
tale
of
her
sufferings
increased
beyond
the
bounds
of
endurance
to
their
hardships
she
turned
a
front
of
steel
but
to
abner
himself
she
was
as
tender
as
she
dared
to
be
the
consciousness
of
this
discipline
sustained
her
she
was
a
new
woman
worn
and
anxious
but
invincibly
cheerful
and
abner
himself
took
heart
from
her
courage
winter
fell
upon
them
the
ramparts
of
the
hills
came
nearer
to
them
encircling
the
valley
with
a
beauty
the
colours
of
life
faded
from
the
land
and
every
farm
was
like
a
fortress
of
stone
against
the
assaults
of
rain
and
icy
wind
the
fields
lay
cold
and
dead
the
sap
sank
downward
from
every
frozen
branch
there
was
no
colour
in
all
the
land
but
a
brilliant
mockery
of
red
berries
on
brier
and
holly
and
thorn
there
s
a
tarrable
lot
of
berry
this
year
said
old
drew
i
reckon
we
m
in
for
a
hard
winter
and
so
the
remotest
possibility
of
finding
work
on
the
farms
drifted
away
from
abner
the
few
labourers
who
moved
about
the
fields
the
solitary
teams
at
plough
seemed
glued
to
the
frozen
surface
of
the
land
stirring
sadly
as
in
a
dream
in
spite
of
the
kindness
of
their
neighbours
so
delicately
shown
in
the
gifts
of
roots
and
bundles
of
wood
that
old
drew
carried
home
on
his
bent
shoulders
the
family
at
wolfpits
felt
the
pinch
of
cold
and
want
mary
true
to
her
resolution
uttered
no
word
of
complaint
but
her
face
told
abner
what
she
was
suffering
so
plainly
that
he
could
not
bear
to
look
at
her
one
night
he
left
her
and
spent
the
evening
with
old
drew
in
his
bedroom
drinking
the
labourer
s
poison
till
his
brain
was
fuddled
and
his
limbs
for
the
first
time
were
warm
mary
heard
him
stumbling
up
the
stairs
at
night
but
when
they
met
next
morning
she
did
not
reproach
him
her
little
store
of
money
was
nearly
gone
one
day
racking
her
brains
for
some
new
expedient
to
stave
off
the
inevitable
end
she
remembered
mrs
malpas
s
visit
and
the
story
of
the
fifty
pounds
which
george
had
stolen
from
the
buffalo
on
the
eve
of
his
imprisonment
she
wondered
desperately
if
the
old
woman
was
right
and
he
had
hidden
it
in
some
corner
of
the
house
she
began
to
search
with
the
fierce
enthusiasm
of
a
seeker
after
treasure
she
spent
all
her
energy
in
turning
the
bedroom
and
kitchen
inside
out
she
looked
into
the
chimneys
for
she
had
heard
that
money
was
sometimes
hidden
in
such
places
by
the
end
of
the
day
she
was
utterly
exhausted
but
had
found
nothing
at
any
rate
she
thought
the
place
looks
a
poor
consolation
that
night
it
occurred
to
her
that
if
only
she
could
get
as
far
as
shrewsbury
she
might
pawn
some
of
her
wedding
presents
particularly
a
set
of
plated
which
her
father
lavish
in
the
expenditure
of
other
people
s
money
had
given
her
they
made
a
clumsy
parcel
difficult
to
conceal
and
in
order
to
spend
as
little
as
possible
on
the
railway
fare
she
decided
to
walk
over
the
hills
towards
clun
and
catch
a
train
on
the
branch
railway
she
left
the
children
in
mrs
mamble
s
care
and
slipped
away
without
letting
abner
know
that
she
had
gone
in
shrewsbury
a
sad
discouragement
awaited
her
the
man
in
the
pawnshop
sniffed
at
her
property
this
kind
of
thing
s
gone
out
of
fashion
he
said
if
you
d
brought
it
here
five
year
ago
i
might
have
done
better
for
you
shillings
s
all
it
s
the
sacrifice
hurt
her
but
she
accepted
his
figure
the
fare
home
to
llandwlas
left
her
with
a
guinea
in
hand
and
on
that
money
they
existed
for
more
than
two
weeks
she
only
prayed
that
abner
would
not
notice
the
blank
in
the
cupboard
from
which
she
had
taken
the
silver
but
she
need
not
have
been
frightened
for
abner
had
no
eye
for
things
of
that
kind
one
imprudence
however
nearly
betrayed
her
on
the
way
to
the
station
at
shrewsbury
she
had
seen
a
box
of
oranges
newly
imported
for
christmas
and
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
of
buying
two
for
the
children
next
day
abner
saw
them
on
the
table
oranges
he
said
his
eyes
shocked
by
her
extravagance
she
lied
quickly
yes
mrs
hendrie
met
me
on
the
road
and
gave
me
them
for
morgan
and
afterward
in
the
curiously
sensitive
state
of
her
conscience
this
lie
troubled
her
he
himself
was
so
open
with
her
that
she
felt
it
almost
a
duty
to
tell
him
the
truth
she
brooded
over
the
question
for
several
days
but
in
the
end
it
sank
into
insignificance
before
the
fact
that
they
had
no
money
left
looking
at
her
empty
purse
she
felt
that
she
could
face
the
situation
no
longer
she
dared
not
ask
for
credit
in
any
shop
in
mainstone
for
she
suspected
that
all
the
must
be
aware
of
her
plight
greatly
daring
she
made
an
expedition
to
lesswardine
and
entered
a
grocer
s
with
whom
she
had
not
dealt
since
the
days
before
her
marriage
the
man
had
been
a
friend
of
her
father
s
perhaps
that
would
count
for
something
it
was
saturday
night
and
the
shop
was
buzzing
with
people
the
grocer
flurried
with
work
scarcely
nodded
to
her
and
she
was
nearly
leaving
the
shop
in
fright
when
a
new
assistant
whom
she
did
not
know
asked
her
what
he
could
serve
her
with
fortunately
she
had
dressed
herself
with
care
and
looked
respectable
she
ordered
blindly
lavishly
and
the
smart
young
man
dumped
her
purchases
on
the
counter
with
a
flourish
and
dashed
off
the
bill
with
a
pencil
that
he
carried
behind
his
ear
in
a
hieroglyphic
of
his
own
cash
or
account
madam
he
asked
rapidly
account
she
murmured
certainly
what
was
the
name
mrs
malpas
of
course
said
the
young
man
excusing
himself
pardon
shall
we
send
them
s
sunday
isn
t
it
she
said
i
think
i
d
better
take
them
with
thank
you
madam
very
kind
of
you
said
the
assistant
making
a
large
parcel
which
he
handed
her
over
the
counter
with
an
obsequious
bow
she
picked
up
her
parcel
and
fled
thankful
that
the
grocer
was
too
busy
to
notice
her
she
felt
that
the
eyes
of
all
the
women
were
on
her
and
that
they
knew
her
for
a
thief
also
she
knew
that
she
could
never
attempt
this
adventure
again
so
the
end
came
or
what
they
thought
must
be
the
end
they
sat
together
one
night
in
the
kitchen
at
wolfpits
and
both
of
them
knew
that
they
were
beaten
a
fire
burned
brightly
in
the
this
thickly
wooded
valley
they
need
never
lack
room
seemed
cosy
and
almost
gay
in
the
firelight
showing
no
signs
that
they
had
fallen
from
prosperity
for
though
mary
had
paid
three
more
visits
to
the
pawnbroker
s
and
now
felt
hardened
to
the
adventure
she
had
always
managed
to
conceal
the
deficiencies
in
the
furniture
by
some
new
arrangement
on
her
last
journey
to
shrewsbury
hurrying
to
the
station
under
the
walls
of
the
jail
the
idea
had
struck
her
that
she
might
be
forced
in
the
end
to
pawn
her
wedding
ring
and
she
had
laughed
bitterly
to
herself
much
good
had
it
done
her
the
idea
had
only
struck
her
as
a
whimsical
prospect
she
had
too
much
common
sense
to
allow
herself
to
be
driven
to
this
conventional
expedient
she
knew
that
they
could
not
go
on
indefinitely
stripping
the
house
of
its
furniture
it
would
be
far
better
to
face
the
facts
if
abner
could
not
find
work
and
there
seemed
no
probability
of
his
doing
so
the
best
that
they
could
do
was
to
part
he
must
leave
her
and
she
pocketing
her
pride
must
apply
to
the
relieving
officer
whom
she
had
once
shown
to
the
door
for
money
from
the
parish
she
knew
that
it
must
come
to
this
and
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
tell
abner
she
had
settled
in
her
mind
that
the
proposal
must
come
from
him
and
for
the
present
he
seemed
numbed
worn
incapable
of
thinking
he
sat
opposite
her
in
silence
with
an
empty
pipe
between
his
teeth
staring
at
the
fire
after
a
little
while
she
found
herself
silently
weeping
and
turned
her
face
away
from
him
blowing
her
nose
to
hide
her
tears
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
and
she
cried
come
in
it
was
old
drew
they
were
not
surprised
by
this
time
they
were
used
to
the
labourer
s
visits
often
in
the
evening
he
would
drop
in
with
the
excuse
of
having
a
talk
with
abner
though
most
of
the
talking
fell
to
mary
and
then
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
he
would
produce
from
one
of
the
vast
pockets
in
his
coat
some
article
of
food
that
he
had
picked
up
at
the
farm
they
knew
so
well
this
delicate
subterfuge
at
first
mary
had
been
amused
by
it
and
more
than
a
little
touched
now
she
only
waited
impatiently
to
see
what
the
old
man
had
brought
that
night
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
never
go
but
just
when
they
had
reached
the
point
when
it
seemed
that
the
eggs
or
turnips
must
appear
he
turned
to
abner
and
told
him
that
he
had
some
good
news
for
him
good
news
said
abner
it
s
a
long
time
since
i
ve
heard
anything
of
i
was
talking
about
ee
to
mr
willums
said
drew
and
told
en
that
you
was
in
a
purty
bad
way
well
drew
says
he
if
it
s
as
bad
as
that
i
don
t
say
we
mightn
t
do
something
there
do
be
a
heap
of
stones
scattered
over
the
top
fields
as
us
might
well
be
rid
on
it
do
be
a
boy
s
work
tis
true
but
fellows
might
be
glad
of
mary
flushed
with
pleasure
and
clasped
her
hands
i
d
be
glad
of
anything
said
abner
well
the
old
man
went
on
i
do
reckon
that
there
be
no
more
n
a
fortnight
s
work
there
and
a
poor
niggling
job
that
s
like
to
break
your
back
at
that
but
i
thought
you
d
be
glad
of
it
and
i
told
en
so
so
up
you
comes
along
with
me
at
six
o
clock
morning
for
i
told
en
you
d
come
for
sure
threepence
an
hour
he
ll
pay
ee
that
makes
twelve
shillin
a
week
tis
not
much
but
tis
they
thanked
him
without
reserve
but
he
shook
his
head
at
them
i
don
t
know
as
it
s
me
you
have
to
thank
he
said
tis
your
old
mother
down
to
the
buffalo
as
you
d
ought
to
be
grateful
to
mr
willums
have
took
it
into
his
head
as
giving
abner
work
would
make
her
mazed
he
ve
never
forgive
her
over
that
cider
and
never
will
he
s
a
long
memory
mr
when
he
left
them
mary
was
so
full
of
an
emotional
thankfulness
that
she
could
not
speak
abner
went
to
bed
cheerfully
she
heard
him
whistling
in
his
room
above
her
next
morning
his
work
at
the
pentre
began
as
mr
williams
had
said
it
was
a
boy
s
work
by
rights
and
unfitted
to
a
man
of
abner
s
strength
at
first
sight
it
seemed
like
one
of
those
labours
which
malignant
kings
impose
upon
their
daughters
suitors
in
fairy
tales
the
pentre
was
a
large
farm
of
miserable
land
its
uppermost
cultivated
fields
reached
nearly
to
the
crown
of
the
smooth
hills
at
the
valley
head
ending
abruptly
at
the
foot
of
stony
screes
from
these
unstable
precipices
the
winter
torrents
rolled
down
many
stones
flat
rocky
fragments
that
impeded
the
plough
nor
were
these
all
for
the
soil
was
so
thin
that
every
ploughing
turned
up
thousands
more
and
in
winter
the
fields
were
overspread
with
a
pale
bloom
of
stones
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
uplands
were
always
cold
enwrapped
in
icy
vapours
or
glistening
with
frost
that
glued
each
fragment
to
the
ground
abner
s
task
was
to
clear
these
stubborn
acres
of
their
surface
stones
an
endless
labour
for
no
sooner
had
he
picked
the
surface
over
than
new
stones
appeared
no
convict
labour
could
have
been
more
monotonous
more
thankless
nor
as
it
seemed
more
futile
from
dawn
to
sunset
he
worked
in
loneliness
no
single
human
figure
approached
him
all
day
long
except
that
of
mr
williams
whom
he
would
see
coming
like
a
speck
in
the
lower
distance
urging
his
pony
upwards
when
he
reached
abner
the
farmer
would
stay
scowling
at
him
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
a
surly
man
and
rarely
spoke
except
on
monday
evenings
after
ludlow
market
then
having
satisfied
himself
that
abner
was
not
shirking
he
would
turn
away
and
walk
his
pony
down
the
hill
again
there
was
never
any
fear
that
abner
would
not
work
it
was
only
by
violent
exertion
that
he
could
keep
any
heat
in
his
body
for
his
food
was
poor
and
the
winter
as
old
drew
had
prophesied
severe
he
toiled
there
in
rain
in
sleet
in
snow
and
in
blinding
mist
the
pay
was
so
poor
that
he
knew
he
could
not
afford
to
miss
a
day
picking
up
stones
with
numbed
and
ragged
fingers
when
no
other
labourers
were
afield
every
evening
he
walked
home
dead
tired
scarcely
knowing
if
his
legs
were
his
own
for
the
continual
stooping
took
all
sensation
away
from
them
once
in
the
dusk
he
lost
his
way
for
he
had
tried
to
shorten
his
journey
by
a
he
found
himself
suddenly
on
the
brink
of
the
pool
but
not
a
bird
was
to
be
seen
for
in
winter
they
returned
to
their
homes
on
the
cardigan
coast
his
memory
of
what
had
happened
there
was
as
hazy
as
that
of
a
dream
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
lived
half
a
lifetime
since
that
night
he
stumbled
down
through
the
fog
and
passed
the
door
of
badger
s
cottage
a
light
burned
in
the
window
and
he
thought
he
saw
susie
moving
in
the
parlour
he
laughed
to
himself
and
damned
her
damned
all
women
another
evening
on
his
way
home
a
overtook
him
coming
over
the
hills
from
clun
it
had
passed
him
before
he
saw
that
its
occupants
were
marion
prosser
and
a
young
farmer
named
maddy
whom
abner
only
knew
by
sight
they
bowled
by
him
at
a
good
pace
he
wondered
if
she
had
recognised
him
for
he
had
been
in
their
sight
for
some
time
if
she
had
she
made
no
sign
of
having
seen
him
and
again
he
hardened
his
heart
against
all
women
and
yet
though
he
did
not
know
it
the
sight
of
abner
trudging
homeward
down
the
lane
had
awakened
a
palpitating
interest
in
marion
s
heart
and
inspired
her
with
a
sudden
distaste
for
the
man
who
was
sitting
in
the
trap
beside
her
she
looked
down
on
him
from
the
height
of
the
driver
s
seat
seeing
his
mean
shoulders
the
thin
nape
of
his
neck
and
his
small
foxy
face
in
profile
she
felt
that
she
would
like
to
lash
at
him
with
the
whip
that
she
held
in
her
hand
but
since
she
knew
that
ladylike
young
women
did
not
do
such
things
she
flicked
him
with
the
lash
of
her
tongue
instead
that
was
fellows
our
cowman
fred
she
said
knowing
that
the
name
would
wound
him
he
gave
an
ugly
laugh
i
know
him
he
had
the
face
to
come
and
ask
me
for
work
i
soon
gave
him
the
you
she
cried
scornfully
you
re
not
fit
to
talk
to
him
he
s
twice
the
man
that
you
he
flushed
look
here
marion
who
the
hell
do
you
think
you
re
talking
to
he
said
clutching
her
arm
with
a
show
of
strength
don
t
she
cried
she
wrenched
herself
free
and
slapped
his
face
the
horse
broke
into
a
canter
that
s
not
the
way
to
get
yourself
married
he
said
she
would
not
reply
to
his
insult
and
they
drove
to
the
dyke
in
an
uncomfortable
silence
next
day
she
set
out
deliberately
to
meet
abner
on
the
road
she
called
to
him
but
he
still
smarting
under
the
discomfort
of
mary
s
outburst
would
not
answer
her
she
followed
him
and
took
him
by
the
arm
abner
she
said
will
you
ever
forgive
me
i
don
t
like
to
think
of
the
way
we
i
don
t
bear
you
any
he
said
that
s
all
over
and
done
i
want
you
to
think
of
me
as
a
friend
she
said
abner
if
ever
you
re
in
need
of
money
if
you
want
money
now
i
wish
you
d
take
it
from
he
laughed
i
m
in
work
now
he
said
you
d
best
leave
us
alone
we
don
t
want
your
his
resentment
burst
out
afresh
nor
you
neither
he
added
she
controlled
herself
very
well
that
s
understood
she
said
and
left
him
without
another
word
she
walked
home
violently
in
the
dusk
thinking
of
the
desperate
mess
she
had
made
of
her
life
wondering
if
she
could
ever
bring
herself
to
marry
a
man
with
sloping
shoulders
and
a
squeaky
voice
like
fred
maddy
what
did
it
matter
what
did
anything
matter
mr
williams
had
reckoned
that
the
top
fields
would
provide
abner
with
a
fortnight
s
work
he
had
merely
given
him
the
job
to
satisfy
a
passing
whim
of
inflicting
a
on
mrs
malpas
and
had
told
him
from
the
first
that
he
could
not
continue
to
employ
him
when
the
work
was
done
luckily
for
abner
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
half
the
fields
remained
uncleared
mr
williams
recognised
that
he
had
worked
well
and
decided
to
keep
him
on
for
perhaps
another
ten
days
the
expense
was
trivial
and
the
job
worth
doing
christmas
his
second
christmas
at
wolfpits
intervened
but
by
the
third
of
january
abner
s
work
at
the
pentre
was
nearly
finished
the
chapter
once
again
the
situation
had
to
be
faced
this
time
abner
was
in
no
doubt
as
to
what
must
be
done
those
lonely
days
on
the
cold
upland
had
given
him
time
to
think
he
now
realised
that
as
far
as
finding
work
in
the
lesswardine
district
went
he
was
definitely
beaten
and
that
every
day
that
he
spent
at
wolfpits
must
make
him
more
and
more
a
drag
upon
the
resources
of
the
family
the
obvious
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
turn
his
early
experiences
at
mawne
to
account
to
set
off
southward
for
the
coal
valleys
and
work
as
a
miner
underground
on
the
welsh
coalfield
wages
ran
high
and
he
might
be
sure
of
earning
enough
to
keep
himself
in
comfort
and
to
supply
the
wolfpits
household
with
a
living
that
would
seem
luxurious
after
their
long
privations
in
solitude
this
determination
had
been
easily
made
and
the
feeling
that
something
definite
was
in
view
had
made
him
happier
and
better
pleased
with
himself
but
when
he
left
the
pentre
and
came
to
lay
his
plans
before
mary
his
course
did
not
seem
so
clear
or
so
free
from
complications
during
their
three
months
of
hardship
their
relations
had
undergone
a
curious
change
mary
s
outburst
of
jealous
anger
when
she
learned
the
true
cause
of
his
dismissal
from
the
dyke
had
swept
through
her
like
a
storm
stripping
her
heart
of
its
hidden
grudges
and
reservations
it
passed
leaving
her
weak
bewildered
and
yet
happy
it
was
as
if
this
sudden
tempest
while
almost
destroying
her
had
snapped
the
last
threads
that
bound
her
to
her
old
life
all
the
past
was
broken
it
rolled
away
from
her
in
a
tumult
of
spent
cloud
and
in
the
serene
silence
that
followed
she
came
to
herself
realising
that
she
was
alone
in
the
world
with
abner
and
her
children
it
was
like
the
bewildered
calm
that
comes
after
an
escape
from
death
the
hushed
birth
of
a
new
world
a
strange
unearthly
quiet
in
this
new
state
she
found
herself
most
eager
to
atone
for
the
endless
wordless
contest
that
she
had
waged
against
him
she
knew
that
she
could
never
repay
him
a
hundredth
part
of
what
he
had
given
her
and
suffered
at
her
hands
the
money
was
nothing
what
he
had
sacrificed
for
her
was
his
freedom
a
hard
denial
for
a
man
in
the
prime
of
youth
and
so
thinking
gratefully
of
his
goodness
toward
her
and
of
his
unfathomed
patience
she
began
to
dwell
tenderly
on
other
aspects
of
the
man
his
splendid
supple
strength
his
honest
eyes
the
straightness
and
simplicity
of
his
whole
nature
and
to
compare
them
instinctively
with
what
she
knew
of
her
husband
his
superficial
charm
his
persuasive
manners
and
his
callous
heart
all
those
qualities
that
she
had
been
taught
by
bitterest
experience
to
hate
and
to
mistrust
it
was
in
this
light
that
abner
seemed
to
her
most
wonderful
and
she
had
used
him
like
a
shrew
every
natural
impulse
of
kindness
in
him
she
had
checked
and
thwarted
pride
had
made
her
thankless
prudishness
had
hardened
her
she
was
detestable
and
if
he
hated
her
she
had
only
herself
to
thank
for
it
but
did
he
hate
her
she
hoped
fervently
that
he
did
not
she
could
not
bear
that
he
should
hate
her
it
pained
her
even
to
think
that
she
owed
his
kindness
to
the
fact
that
he
had
given
some
promise
to
george
and
in
the
simplicity
of
his
nature
felt
that
he
must
redeem
it
she
knew
that
he
was
fond
of
the
children
and
could
not
bear
to
see
them
suffer
but
that
was
not
enough
for
her
her
new
being
craved
for
a
personal
devotion
if
that
were
not
forthcoming
she
felt
that
she
would
have
little
left
in
the
world
that
her
life
must
be
finally
bitter
and
useless
and
she
knew
that
she
was
far
too
young
for
any
such
finality
she
hated
the
pride
that
had
brought
her
to
this
and
resolved
to
proclaim
her
new
humility
by
every
means
in
her
power
abner
himself
was
sensible
of
the
change
in
her
attitude
toward
him
during
the
time
of
his
work
at
the
pentre
he
became
aware
of
it
little
by
little
for
she
was
far
too
cautious
to
make
the
change
a
sudden
one
she
was
demolishing
the
barrier
that
she
had
built
so
carefully
between
them
and
he
reluctantly
had
accepted
slowly
almost
imperceptibly
they
were
nearing
once
more
the
point
which
they
had
reached
in
a
moment
of
stress
and
abandonment
on
the
night
of
the
white
mist
six
months
before
the
moment
when
he
had
seen
her
transfigured
or
rather
revealed
as
the
one
woman
in
the
world
whom
he
wanted
body
and
soul
in
all
those
hard
days
not
a
single
chilling
word
passed
her
lips
not
a
single
intolerable
silence
drove
him
away
from
her
her
kindness
made
her
beautiful
but
the
nearness
of
her
beauty
frightened
him
and
he
withdrew
himself
having
once
cruelly
burnt
his
fingers
at
that
flame
he
was
happy
but
could
not
trust
his
happiness
not
because
any
scruples
of
honour
pricked
him
but
because
he
feared
a
new
rebuff
even
though
he
dared
not
believe
in
her
submission
he
could
not
escape
the
influence
of
her
tenderness
the
lean
days
were
the
best
he
had
ever
known
at
wolfpits
even
if
he
had
had
money
to
spend
he
would
not
have
gone
elsewhere
and
every
moment
that
brought
him
nearer
to
the
inevitable
parting
on
which
he
had
decided
made
the
idea
of
it
more
painful
and
more
difficult
it
now
seemed
to
him
monstrously
unreasonable
that
when
such
complete
happiness
was
in
his
grasp
he
should
wilfully
renounce
it
and
yet
what
else
could
he
do
a
sense
of
the
futility
of
her
kindness
made
him
shrink
from
it
she
saw
what
was
happening
knew
that
she
deserved
it
and
in
order
that
she
might
justify
herself
she
now
tried
to
play
on
his
affection
for
the
children
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
interdependence
among
the
four
of
them
to
bind
him
closer
to
her
with
a
web
of
many
strands
each
so
slender
that
he
need
not
be
aware
of
the
process
but
he
felt
the
light
pressure
of
the
net
in
which
he
was
being
entangled
he
struggled
to
free
himself
and
she
saw
the
convulsions
of
his
struggle
and
feared
to
lose
him
the
thrill
of
this
new
conflict
held
her
on
the
saturday
night
before
his
last
week
at
the
pentre
he
kept
back
five
shillings
of
his
earnings
by
working
from
dawn
till
sunset
each
day
he
had
managed
to
put
in
many
hours
of
overtime
so
that
he
was
able
to
give
her
half
a
sovereign
clear
it
seemed
to
him
a
good
opportunity
for
breaking
the
news
of
his
plan
to
her
sooner
or
later
the
word
must
be
spoken
she
held
the
gold
coin
in
her
hand
and
looked
at
him
inquiringly
you
ll
be
two
bob
short
this
week
he
said
but
if
any
one
knows
how
to
manage
you
do
after
that
i
reckon
things
ll
begin
to
look
up
a
she
flushed
with
a
sudden
pleasure
abner
she
cried
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
mr
williams
is
going
to
keep
you
on
not
he
said
abner
there
s
not
more
than
four
or
five
days
left
of
the
stone
picking
and
i
can
tell
you
i
m
not
all
that
sorry
my
back
s
fair
broke
at
it
no
i
m
thinking
of
a
change
i
might
stay
on
round
here
a
year
before
i
find
another
job
worth
calling
one
they
ve
got
a
down
on
you
and
me
these
farming
chaps
them
and
your
old
mother
there
s
only
one
thing
to
be
done
as
i
can
see
and
that
s
what
i
ve
kept
five
bob
back
for
i
don
t
understand
abner
she
said
understanding
only
too
well
of
course
you
don
t
well
i
ll
tell
you
while
i
ve
been
up
on
the
hill
i
ve
had
a
good
few
hours
for
thinking
i
ve
reckoned
it
all
up
square
there
s
about
four
month
as
you
ll
have
to
hang
on
here
afore
old
george
comes
out
and
you
can
t
keep
the
lot
of
us
for
four
odd
month
on
nothing
that
s
clear
enough
bain
t
it
she
assented
so
i
thought
like
this
what
s
the
use
of
a
chap
of
my
sort
that
s
learned
a
trade
and
all
and
can
pick
up
good
money
at
it
going
round
cadging
work
from
a
lot
of
beggars
that
don
t
mean
to
give
it
me
i
ve
had
a
bellyful
of
farmers
promises
i
have
and
i
tell
you
straight
again
she
said
yes
and
so
this
is
how
i
see
it
the
only
thing
left
for
me
when
i
ve
finished
along
with
old
williams
is
to
take
a
turn
down
swansea
swansea
she
cried
that
s
it
i
looked
it
up
sunday
in
the
on
llandwlas
station
and
asked
about
the
fare
you
go
down
through
builth
and
brecon
and
neath
and
five
bob
ll
do
it
there
s
plenty
of
work
going
in
the
western
valleys
they
say
and
good
money
and
all
you
can
pick
up
two
pound
ten
a
week
without
killing
yourself
either
they
say
lodging
s
dear
but
i
reckon
i
can
send
you
a
clear
pound
easy
postal
orders
you
can
change
at
mainstone
and
nobody
know
where
they
come
from
i
ought
to
have
done
it
before
i
know
that
but
now
it
looks
like
as
if
there
s
nothing
while
he
spoke
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
little
room
never
looking
at
her
her
eyes
followed
him
but
her
heart
fell
within
her
he
finished
and
faced
her
she
could
scarcely
answer
him
you
mean
that
you
must
go
away
leave
me
that
s
the
ticket
he
said
i
ought
to
have
done
it
afore
if
i
had
they
d
have
left
you
but
you
can
t
she
said
you
can
t
you
can
t
live
on
nothing
he
said
brutally
she
could
not
listen
to
reason
she
was
beyond
reason
now
no
no
she
cried
abner
you
mustn
t
go
he
set
his
will
against
her
she
stood
and
trembled
before
him
but
he
would
not
face
her
for
fear
that
he
should
be
softened
he
kept
silence
you
can
t
she
cried
again
i
couldn
t
face
it
the
loneliness
i
couldn
t
really
this
place
all
alone
no
abner
you
can
t
it
s
not
for
so
long
he
reassured
her
what
s
four
month
after
that
you
ll
have
george
back
george
she
cried
oh
don
t
speak
of
it
you
re
cruel
her
words
came
as
a
shock
to
him
it
was
now
many
months
since
they
had
spoken
of
george
since
the
evening
of
his
letter
she
had
not
even
mentioned
his
name
to
the
children
nor
encouraged
abner
to
talk
about
him
abner
saw
the
fateful
direction
in
which
the
tide
was
drifting
and
held
steadily
to
his
course
it
s
not
so
long
since
he
said
that
you
told
me
to
go
away
if
i
wanted
to
the
time
they
tried
to
get
you
to
go
and
keep
house
for
the
parson
i
reckon
you
ve
changed
about
a
good
bit
since
of
course
i
ve
changed
she
said
i
was
a
fool
then
i
didn
t
know
what
i
wanted
it
s
different
she
paused
and
then
returned
instinctively
to
her
first
words
you
can
t
you
can
t
you
re
talking
wild
he
said
brusquely
i
ve
thought
it
all
out
it
s
the
only
thing
you
ll
have
the
comfort
you
m
used
to
you
and
the
kids
you
won
t
find
it
all
that
lonely
with
your
stomachs
full
it
s
the
bad
times
we
ve
been
having
that
makes
you
talk
like
still
she
protested
no
no
it
isn
t
i
couldn
t
bear
it
it
s
like
taking
the
life
away
from
he
didn
t
wait
to
think
what
she
meant
he
was
angry
that
she
should
increase
the
difficulty
of
his
parting
it
s
no
good
talking
to
you
he
said
if
you
can
t
see
sense
i
can
t
take
you
along
with
me
can
i
why
not
she
stood
before
him
meek
submissive
he
was
overwhelmed
through
all
those
months
he
had
schooled
himself
so
thoroughly
that
this
sudden
voluntary
surrender
staggered
him
his
heart
melted
within
him
the
blood
beat
in
his
wrists
the
past
shrivelled
away
in
that
moment
s
flame
the
future
was
a
blaze
of
light
and
in
the
present
he
saw
nothing
but
the
woman
of
his
desire
there
had
been
no
one
like
her
in
all
his
lighter
loves
he
had
been
able
to
see
himself
from
without
as
a
creature
fevered
with
appetite
but
now
he
was
lost
he
knew
nothing
in
the
world
but
mary
her
softened
eyes
the
curve
of
her
lips
the
thrill
of
her
yielding
body
he
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
holding
her
so
that
her
breath
came
quickly
on
his
cheek
and
strained
her
toward
him
as
though
by
doing
so
he
might
make
her
a
part
of
himself
even
if
he
killed
her
with
his
strength
in
that
moment
she
was
made
his
clasped
immutably
to
him
in
the
surrounding
darkness
their
lips
were
joined
in
eager
kisses
her
proud
body
gave
itself
to
his
arms
her
eyes
were
closed
her
lips
infinitely
happy
mary
mary
he
whispered
to
her
rejoicing
in
the
sound
of
her
name
but
his
voice
was
strange
distant
thick
with
passion
and
his
clasping
hands
could
not
be
certain
that
they
held
her
they
followed
every
curve
of
her
body
seeking
to
know
if
it
were
really
she
his
tongue
stumbled
on
phrases
that
had
never
come
to
him
before
mary
my
little
one
my
beauty
did
i
use
you
rough
did
i
hurt
you
she
shook
her
head
and
smiled
back
at
him
full
of
content
she
herself
shyly
daring
allowed
her
hands
to
caress
his
head
stroking
his
hair
his
ears
his
neck
and
the
light
contact
of
her
fingers
maddened
him
finding
strange
nerves
that
had
never
felt
before
awakening
new
yearnings
at
last
she
opened
her
eyes
the
lamp
s
flaring
she
said
in
a
curious
toneless
voice
smiling
gently
she
freed
herself
from

and
turned
down

wick

laughed
as
he
kissed
her

yo

or
four
days

finished
up
at
old
williams

a
good
turn
and
don
t
you

besides
that

a
few
days
over
that
and
i
ll
go

and

abner
she
cried
don

now
don
t
you

me
if
ever
i
lose
sight
of
you
now
something
will
happen
i
know
it
as
sure
as
you
m
a
baby
that
s
what
you
are
he
said
teasing
he
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
and
talked
foolishly
to
her
no
she
said
shaking
her
head
i
mean
it
i
m
as
serious
as
i
can
a
damned
sight
too
serious
for
me
he
grumbled
we
must
all
go
together
in
three
days
i
can
be
ready
no
in
that
case
every
one
ll
see
us
you
m
all
the
other
way
i
don
t
care
who
sees
us
now
she
said
passionately
what
does
it
matter
let
it
take
its
chance
it
s
nothing
to
us
i
m
so
sick
of
their
talk
that
it
means
nothing
to
she
became
thoughtful
once
more
abner
she
said
suddenly
tell
me
truly
when
did
you
first
want
me
again
he
teased
her
what
does
that
matter
i
want
to
know
she
protested
and
he
told
her
of
the
night
at
redlake
when
he
had
stood
burning
in
the
moonlight
beneath
the
windows
of
the
inn
i
knew
i
knew
she
said
softly
i
couldn
t
sleep
that
night
the
time
we
ve
lost
us
two
oh
how
i
hate
myself
it
was
nearly
the
same
with
me
just
when
we
d
missed
our
way
and
my
legs
ached
so
that
i
felt
i
couldn
t
walk
another
step
poor
little
morgan
and
the
bottle
of
pop
you
promised
him
and
then
those
strange
crying
up
in
the
dark
do
you
remember
how
i
turned
on
you
and
told
you
i
hated
the
sight
of
you
that
was
when
i
loved
you
then
and
ever
we
ve
been
through
something
one
time
and
another
he
said
she
laughed
softly
it
s
like
a
long
courtship
she
said
george
and
i
only
knew
each
other
six
weeks
before
we
were
it
amazed
her
to
find
that
now
she
could
speak
of
george
without
discomfort
her
mind
ran
swiftly
over
those
early
days
abner
she
said
i
feel
sorry
for
george
now
don
t
you
don
t
speak
of
him
said
abner
seriously
you
re
jealous
don
t
speak
of
him
i
gave
old
george
my
word
i
ve
not
been
a
pal
to
you
re
a
funny
boy
she
said
loving
him
with
her
eyes
i
want
to
forget
old
george
he
said
obstinately
then
i
won
t
speak
of
him
abner
what
time
is
it
she
put
her
hand
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
took
out
his
watch
the
sweet
familiarity
of
the
action
entranced
him
his
eyes
followed
her
fingers
and
the
newly
conscious
turn
of
her
head
as
she
looked
at
it
ten
o
clock
she
said
who
d
have
thought
it
she
rose
and
again
she
abandoned
herself
to
his
arms
then
she
left
him
suddenly
and
went
before
him
never
looking
back
he
followed
with
the
little
lamp
in
his
hand
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
stopped
what
s
the
matter
she
whispered
turning
aren
t
you
coming
there
s
a
step
outside
he
said
some
one
on
the
garden
whoever
can
it
be
at
this
time
take
the
light
to
the
door
and
the
darkness
of
the
staircase
engulfed
her
as
he
opened
the
kitchen
door
and
peered
outside
who
s
that
he
called
is
that
you
abner
a
voice
replied
now
i
thought
i
see
d
a
light
i
guessed
you
d
have
gone
up
over
by
what
do
you
want
mr
drew
you
wait
while
i
do
get
my
breath
back
said
the
old
man
he
had
evidently
been
drinking
and
walked
unsteadily
ah
that
s
better
well
abner
i
ve
a
been
down
to
the
buffalo
for
a
quart
and
i
thought
as
how
i
d
bring

a
bit
of
downright
good
news
i
heared
yes
old
mrs
malpas
she
ve
got
news
from
it
be
by
letter
or
word
of
mouth
i
can
t
say
for
young
george
have
behaved
himself
so
well
into
prison
that
they
m
going
to
knock
off
part
of
his
time
any
day
this
week
he
may
be
coming
home
along
so
they
says
and
i
thought
i
d
better
bring
the
news
quick
to
his
coming
home
said
abner
dazed
yes
tis
not
onusual
they
do
say
if
she
s
abed
you
can
tell
her
in
the
marnin
wish
ee
i
ll
tell
her
thank
ee
for
looking
oh
that
s
nothing
tis
only
natural
mr
he
closed
the
door
the
light
fell
on
mary
standing
pale
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
he
s
coming
back
said
abner
i
heard
when
he
couldn
t
say
certain
in
a
day
or
abner
well
there
it
is
we
re
only
just
in
time
my
she
stood
mute
paralysed
he
wished
she
would
speak
it
s
no
good
your
standing
there
he
said
go
on
up
i
ll
hold
the
she
did
not
move
i
can
t
take
it
in
she
said
he
put
the
lamp
down
on
the
table
again
and
held
out
his
arms
still
she
did
not
move
mary
she
obeyed
came
to
his
arms
shuddering
shaken
with
sobs
and
through
her
tears
he
kissed
her
comforting
mary
don
t
cry
now
don
t
cry
what
did
i
tell
you
she
wailed
abner
i
knew
i
knew
i
told
you
something
would
happen
thank
god
it
came
in
time
we
ve
not
a
minute
to
think
two
or
three
days
abner
we
go
he
did
not
answer
her
for
his
mind
was
deeply
troubled
i
think
i
can
manage
if
you
leave
it
to
me
she
said
he
held
her
closer
what
does
it
matter
if
we
take
nothing
away
only
just
a
few
clothes
for
me
and
the
children
i
can
leave
everything
tidy
just
as
it
was
when
he
she
hesitated
for
she
remembered
the
that
she
had
pawned
in
shrewsbury
he
would
miss
that
then
she
realised
thankfully
that
it
was
her
wedding
present
not
his
nearly
everything
she
said
don
t
you
think
it
s
better
that
we
should
start
with
nothing
in
lodgings
at
first
won
t
it
be
strange
she
laughed
softly
and
not
a
soul
to
know
it
s
beginning
life
all
over
again
oh
abner
my
love
so
she
spoke
confidently
at
times
almost
gaily
and
he
made
believe
that
he
was
listening
to
her
humouring
her
childishness
and
isn
t
it
lucky
she
said
that
mr
drew
s
working
up
at
the
pentre
you
won
t
need
to
go
there
yourself
if
you
get
up
early
you
can
catch
him
before
he
goes
and
send
up
a
message
to
the
farm
it
isn
t
as
if
it
mattered
your
breaking
your
word
to
mr
williams
people
must
make
allowances
mustn
t
they
he
did
not
answer
her
and
she
became
conscious
of
his
brooding
abner
what
s
up
with
you
tell
me
you
re
frightening
me
abner
we
can
t
go
he
said
but
abner
we
must
we
must
two
or
three
days
he
said
he
might
even
be
a
day
early
he
might
come
think
of
it
abner
i
should
if
george
is
coming
home
like
that
we
can
t
abner
are
you
mad
what
s
come
over
you
i
don
t
know
naught
s
come
over
me
it
s
hearing
his
name
sudden
like
that
it
s
like
a
judgment
it
makes
you
judgment
she
scoffed
oh
abner
haven
t
we
thought
enough
haven
t
we
been
thinking
for
six
months
i
m
sick
of
thinking
like
a
warning
just
the
very
second
if
he
d
come
an
hour
later
what
s
the
difference
abner
if
he
d
come
or
in
a
week
s
time
it
would
be
no
different
we
d
made
up
our
minds
abner
we
re
not
children
things
like
that
don
t
count
whether
you
ve
had
me
or
not
i
m
yours
you
know
she
clung
closer
to
him
but
his
mind
would
not
accept
the
sway
of
her
emotion
he
freed
himself
from
her
hands
and
the
movement
swept
her
into
a
passion
abner
she
cried
don
t
do
that
don
t
you
ll
kill
me
kill
me
george
is
my
pal
he
said
stolidly
i
gave
old
george
my
word
we
shook
hands
on
it
george
and
me
abner
he
said
you
m
the
only
pal
i
ve
got
that
i
can
oh
that
s
it
is
it
she
cried
and
her
voice
went
shrill
that
s
it
what
children
men
are
gave
george
your
word
don
t
you
see
that
you
ve
broken
your
word
already
broken
it
long
ago
ever
since
you
thought
of
me
like
that
and
then
you
say
you
love
me
that
isn
t
love
abner
not
my
kind
anyway
he
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
and
she
could
not
speak
now
for
tears
his
own
face
was
anguished
you
d
better
kill
me
and
have
done
with
it
she
sobbed
far
better
oh
why
don
t
you
kill
me
right
out
if
you
re
going
to
leave
me
i
wish
i
were
dead
i
do
abner
if
we
don
t
go
away
i
shall
lose
you
i
know
it
i
know
it
for
my
sake
abner
i
ve
had
so
little
he
fondled
her
as
she
spoke
i
m
not
going
to
leave
go
of
you
he
said
don
t
you
ever
think
that
he
kissed
her
tearful
face
but
i
gave
old
george
my
word
he
continued
obstinately
oh
damn
your
word
she
cried
violently
wrenching
herself
away
from
him
don
t
get
wild
he
protested
listen
to
i
won
t
listen
you
re
talking
wickedly
you
ve
got
to
listen
my
girl
he
took
hold
of
her
and
held
her
with
his
strength
a
chap
may
go
back
on
his
word
every
one
knows
that
but
a
man
that
s
worth
calling
don
t
go
slinking
away
behind
another
chap
s
back
like
a
dog
if
old
george
is
coming
home
he
s
got
to
hear
what
i
say
to
his
face
not
find
the
place
empty
and
say
i
ve
run
away
from
him
me
and
george
has
got
to
have
this
then
take
us
away
first
she
pleaded
and
come
back
to
see
him
you
m
talking
soft
now
i
m
frightened
abner
frightened
you
ve
no
need
to
be
while
i
m
here
i
can
look
after
myself
and
you
too
i
m
going
to
see
old
george
and
tell
him
straight
you
may
like
it
or
lump
it
that
s
my
she
wept
inconsolable
she
would
not
let
him
comfort
her
she
hoped
that
her
tears
would
soften
him
can
t
you
do
just
one
thing
for
me
abner
you
re
cruel
cruel
you
don
t
love
me
that
isn
t
i
ve
got
to
do
it
my
own
you
might
just
as
well
kill
i
ve
never
run
away
from
a
man
if
you
don
t
take
me
away
from
here
now
she
said
desperately
you
ll
never
have
me
at
all
never
i
know
it
abner
it
s
our
last
it
s
been
too
much
for
you
he
said
you
can
t
see
anything
clear
i
m
not
a
chap
that
she
stared
at
him
in
silence
with
sad
resentful
eyes
then
she
lost
control
of
herself
and
began
to
curse
the
clumsiness
of
old
drew
who
had
blundered
in
on
them
with
his
drunken
gossip
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
ll
never
forgive
him
she
cried
never
she
shouted
like
a
drunken
woman
then
she
stopped
and
listened
intently
just
as
an
animal
listens
in
suspicion
morgan
awakened
by
the
sound
of
raised
voices
had
begun
to
cry
it
s
morgan
she
whispered
you
d
better
go
to
him
abner
replied
she
put
her
hands
to
her
face
don
t
she
cried
oh
abner
don
t
you
re
driving
me
go
on
he
said
roughly
i
ll
put
the
light
out
got
the
matches
she
saw
that
he
meant
it
and
blindly
went
slowly
methodically
abner
locked
the
kitchen
door
and
put
out
the
light
a
moment
later
he
himself
went
upstairs
in
the
dark
morgan
was
still
sobbing
mechanically
for
the
sake
of
hearing
his
own
voice
and
as
abner
passed
the
door
he
was
aware
of
a
soft
moaning
which
told
him
that
mary
was
crying
too
his
heart
ached
his
body
yearned
for
her
but
in
his
brain
george
malpas
s
words
by
god
you
re
the
only
pal
i
ve
got
that
i
can
trust
in
a
day
or
two
george
would
be
home
and
then
the
situation
must
be
faced
he
could
not
be
a
man
and
run
away
from
it
he
got
into
bed
lying
there
in
the
dark
listening
to
the
ceaseless
creaking
of
the
boards
and
joists
he
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
his
body
was
on
fire
he
knew
that
he
could
not
possibly
sleep
and
guessed
that
mary
surely
was
awake
he
was
a
damned
soft
fool
and
nothing
more
lying
there
with
eyes
open
staring
at
the
darkness
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
a
soft
step
on
the
stairs
the
latch
of
his
door
started
his
heart
dissolved
within
him
he
leapt
out
of
bed
trembling
tingling
in
every
limb
mary
had
been
wiser
he
knew
it
she
had
come
to
him
for
comfort
she
was
his
in
a
moment
she
would
be
sinking
warm
into
his
arms
his
scruples
vanished
like
a
puff
of
smoke
he
heard
himself
swallow
heard
his
breath
coming
in
short
grunts
he
opened
the
door
to
meet
her
to
take
her
the
stair
was
empty
and
dark
a
rat
scuttled
away
in
the
wainscot
a
dank
wintry
air
possessed
the
house
he
slammed
the
door
to
viciously
next
morning
before
mary
had
stirred
from
her
bed
he
had
set
out
as
usual
for
the
pentre
the
chapter
on
the
same
day
at
noon
george
malpas
paraded
before
the
governor
of
shrewsbury
jail
to
take
his
discharge
the
interview
was
short
almost
friendly
the
prisoner
had
behaved
well
throughout
his
term
the
chaplain
had
reported
on
him
as
a
young
man
of
superior
intelligence
and
for
these
reasons
a
remission
of
a
quarter
of
his
sentence
had
been
recommended
and
sanctioned
from
the
governor
s
office
he
was
marched
across
the
rigid
quadrangle
that
he
knew
and
hated
to
another
room
where
he
signed
a
receipt
for
the
personal
belongings
that
had
been
taken
from
him
in
the
lesswardine
and
now
miraculously
reappeared
a
warder
checked
them
as
each
was
handed
out
one
watch
silver
chain
with
medal
one
packet
of
letters
one
notebook
and
lead
pencil
one
steel
folding
four
shillings
and
twopence
silver
and
copper
one
he
paused
is
that
all
george
malpas
was
seized
with
a
sudden
anxiety
he
tried
to
speak
but
long
familiarity
with
the
ways
of
warders
made
him
frightened
to
use
his
tongue
not
half
said
the
other
with
a
wink
one
leather
wallet
fifty
pounds
in
bank
of
england
god
that
s
something
like
said
the
other
handing
it
to
george
with
a
wink
he
thrust
it
into
the
breast
pocket
of
the
coat
which
had
been
placed
that
morning
in
his
cell
and
the
action
gave
him
an
unfamiliar
thrill
what
a
thing
it
was
to
have
pockets
well
malpas
it
s
then
said
the
warder
who
was
also
a
humorist
look
in
any
time
you
re
passing
george
malpas
did
not
smile
they
showed
him
out
of
a
small
doorway
at
the
side
of
the
arch
under
which
the
prison
vans
came
grinding
in
from
his
cell
he
had
been
able
to
hear
the
sound
of
the
horses
shoes
sliding
on
the
stone
he
saw
a
street
along
which
free
men
were
moving
with
a
rapt
purposive
hurry
sometimes
a
would
turn
and
look
up
idly
at
the
great
doors
and
the
fan
of
spikes
that
surmounted
them
george
had
never
seen
the
gateway
before
he
only
knew
the
jail
as
a
heavy
building
dominating
the
hill
above
the
station
when
they
had
brought
him
handcuffed
from
the
train
humiliated
wondering
if
it
were
worth
while
wrenching
himself
free
and
throwing
his
body
on
the
rails
they
had
driven
him
to
the
prison
in
a
black
van
now
he
stood
undetermined
not
knowing
which
way
to
take
over
the
the
city
of
shrewsbury
sprawled
spires
towers
and
smoke
stacks
blowing
in
a
free
and
windy
sky
not
a
leaf
on
the
trees
and
black
unfriendly
dust
whirling
along
brick
pavements
he
shivered
for
some
reason
his
clothes
hung
loose
and
damp
upon
him
he
must
have
lost
flesh
of
course
he
had
lost
flesh
who
wouldn
t
after
fourteen
months
in
jail
a
cart
came
slowly
past
him
with
a
load
of
horse
manure
a
good
smell
a
country
smell
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
and
the
noise
made
george
malpas
jump
that
was
a
bad
sign
surely
the
sooner
he
got
a
drink
and
steadied
his
nerves
the
better
he
looked
up
and
down
the
road
for
the
sign
of
a
a
hundred
yards
away
a
strip
of
hoarding
with
gilt
letters
topped
the
of
a
red
brick
building
astill
s
celebrated
entire
it
said
brummagem
beer
was
better
than
nothing
he
crossed
the
road
with
long
strides
but
a
driven
fast
down
the
middle
of
the
street
made
him
pause
there
was
a
bicycle
behind
it
and
he
did
not
think
he
could
avoid
both
people
should
not
be
allowed
to
drive
so
furiously
he
reached
the
and
thanked
god
for
his
escape
he
felt
that
in
gaining
the
shelter
of
its
walls
he
was
doing
more
than
sheltering
from
the
bitter
wind
and
the
dust
he
grew
surer
of
himself
cracked
a
joke
with
the
barmaid
and
paid
for
his
beer
the
florin
that
she
tendered
him
in
change
for
a
looked
like
a
foreign
coin
he
examined
it
suspiciously
it
s
all
right
she
said
one
of
these
new
ones
it
s
quite
a
change
to
get
the
prince
of
wales
head
isn
t
it
i
don
t
think
he
looks
half
the
man
of
king
no
he
agreed
no
he
don
he
examined
the
coin
bewildered
then
fearing
that
she
must
read
the
whole
of
his
story
in
his
ignorance
he
pocketed
his
money
and
darted
out
into
the
street
again
it
was
strange
how
a
broken
habit
reasserted
itself
he
put
his
hand
in
his
unfamiliar
waistcoat
pocket
and
pulled
out
his
watch
nine
o
clock
that
was
impossible
he
laughed
realising
that
his
watch
had
run
down
at
its
usual
winding
time
on
the
night
of
his
arrest
i
m
like
a
fool
he
thought
i
don
t
know
what
i
m
doing
i
m
dull
useless
i
want
another
gradually
under
the
influence
of
the
liquor
his
confidence
returned
it
must
be
market
day
in
shrewsbury
he
thought
for
the
streets
were
so
full
of
people
but
reflection
told
him
that
shrewsbury
market
is
not
held
on
a
monday
and
that
the
crowd
that
moved
on
the
pavements
of
the
steep
high
street
was
no
more
than
the
normal
traffic
it
gave
him
a
thrill
of
pleasure
to
realise
that
people
were
not
staring
at
him
he
was
encouraged
to
slacken
his
pace
to
walk
no
longer
as
if
some
one
were
pursuing
him
he
stared
in
several
shop
windows
and
at
last
found
himself
gazing
at
his
own
image
in
a
long
mirror
it
gave
him
a
start
to
find
himself
facing
an
elongated
lath
of
a
man
that
he
did
not
know
until
he
realised
that
the
mirror
was
a
convex
affair
placed
as
an
advertisement
outside
an
to
emphasise
the
contrast
between
a
man
who
had
fed
there
and
one
who
had
not
it
was
not
such
a
bad
idea
he
would
go
in
and
eat
his
first
square
meal
the
place
was
nearly
empty
for
shrewsbury
does
not
dine
till
one
o
clock
they
brought
him
steak
and
kidney
pudding
the
best
that
he
had
ever
tasted
and
a
pint
of
half
and
half
he
began
to
feel
a
man
again
he
called
the
waiter
for
a
second
drink
and
ordered
with
it
a
local
looking
through
it
at
leisure
he
found
that
the
trains
to
llandwlas
had
not
been
altered
though
there
was
now
time
to
get
a
drink
in
the
change
at
craven
arms
if
he
caught
the
afternoon
train
he
would
have
time
to
look
about
shrewsbury
for
another
two
hours
and
see
to
certain
business
matters
that
were
in
the
back
of
his
mind
he
paid
his
bill
gave
the
waiter
a
liberal
tip
and
walked
up
the
hill
past
the
houses
to
the
main
street
he
wondered
if
the
place
was
where
it
used
to
be
yes
it
was
still
there
it
pleased
him
to
think
that
he
hadn
t
lost
his
memory
nothing
would
have
surprised
him
after
all
those
useless
numbing
months
above
the
shop
door
was
the
inscription
emigration
inside
a
long
counter
backed
by
posters
of
shipping
companies
and
a
single
yawning
clerk
who
had
been
left
in
charge
during
the
luncheon
hour
he
asked
george
what
he
could
do
for
him
canada
said
george
i
want
to
know
all
about
the
young
man
produced
a
sheaf
of
circulars
and
began
to
explain
he
found
it
difficult
to
place
the
applicant
his
pale
face
his
hat
jammed
on
his
head
to
hide
the
prison
crop
his
equivocal
hands
are
you
a
mechanic
he
asked
no
the
clerk
stared
at
him
farmer
you
want
to
buy
land

i
don
t
i
want
to
work
on
it
i
have
a

get
two
references

assisted
passage

said
the
clerk
producing
a
form
never
mind
that
i
can
t
wait
for
any
rubbish
of
that
kind
what
s
the
fare
steerage
the
clerk
looked
it
up
liverpool
quebec
that
s
what

he
said
then

right
over
to
calgary
if
you
take
my
advice
i
ll
write
it
all
down
for
he
did
so
in
a
sloped
flourishing
hand
on
the
back
of
one
of
the
circulars
you
ll
get
the
allan
boat
from
liverpool
saturday
week
he
said
george
thanked
him
and
plunged
out
into
the
street
at
the
station
he
bought
a
daily
paper
the
north
bromwich
as
usual
on
monday
it
was
full
of
football
albion
at
the
top
of
the
first
league
notts
forest
second
strange
clubs
from
the
southern
league
had
invaded
that
sanctuary
the
season
was
half
over
and
they
were
shaping
well
he
read
words
that
meant
nothing
to
him
he
could
not
concentrate
for
he
had
drunk
as
much
as
was
good
for
him
the
platform
seemed
to
him
a
noisy
exposed
situation
for
he
could
not
yet
be
at
his
ease
in
a
crowd
he
started
at
the
sound
of
a
familiar
voice
speaking
the
word
lesswardine
a
man
passed
him
in
a
drab
mr
prosser
of
the
dyke
talking
to
young
maddy
they
had
not
recognised
him
he
slipped
into
a
urinal
to
avoid
them
and
waited
there
till
he
heard
the
train
roll
in
then
he
made
a
dash
for
a
carriage
and
hid
himself
behind
his
newspaper
in
the
corner
the
train
was
not
full
and
to
his
great
relief
no
one
entered
his
compartment
they
started
smoothly
and
soon
left
shrewsbury
behind
a
wintry
landscape
unfolded
on
either
side
of
him
the
low
bow
of
the
wrekin
caer
caradoc
a
sheer
crag
on
the
left
the
cloven
bastions
of
the
long
mynd
he
threw
up
the
window
and
drank
in
great
draughts
of
hill
air
he
laughed
to
see
the
green
of
the
fields
and
the
gray
monstrous
hills
but
he
knew
that
he
was
a
stranger
the
country
that
he
rejoiced
to
see
had
rejected
him
if
he
lived
to
be
a
hundred
not
a
single
man
of
his
acquaintance
would
forget
that
he
had
spent
a
year
in
jail
as
soon
as
he
should
have
left
craven
arms
the
hills
would
fold
him
in
draw
him
within
the
confines
of
his
old
life
he
was
free
but
this
could
never
be
a
real
freedom
a
wider
country
a
new
life
canada
he
was
dying
for
a
drink
at
craven
arms
the
satisfaction
of
this
desire
did
not
seem
easy
for
others
were
before
him
in
the
refreshment
room
and
every
moment
his
chance
of
meeting
lesswardine
people
increased
he
took
a
flask
of
brandy
from
the
counter
and
paid
for
it
without
waiting
for
the
change
the
local
train
stood
humbly
in
the
siding
he
chose
a
carriage
already
full
of
radnor
farmers
whom
he
did
not
know
he
drank
down
the
whole
of
his
flask
of
brandy
and
then
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze
lulled
by
the
voices
of
his
companions
the
train
twisted
along
the
valley
in
the
dark
pulling
up
with
a
jolt
at
every
upland
station
at
llandwlas
he
turned
out
in
a
hurry
and
handed
his
ticket
to
a
new
porter
who
stood
at
the
gate
in
the
dusk
swinging
a
lantern
men
were
shouting
driving
bullocks
into
a
pen
a
trap
was
waiting
with
the
lamps
already
lit
he
avoided
their
light
but
guessed
by
the
colour
of
the
horse
and
the
erect
figure
of
the
driver
that
marion
was
waiting
for
mr
prosser
a
year
before
he
might
have
dared
to
ask
for
a
lift
to
chapel
green
god
how
strange
how
hauntingly
strange
the
country
smelt
an
hour
later
he
staggered
into
the
bar
at
the
buffalo
mrs
malpas
a
withered
pathetic
figure
half
the
size
of
the
woman
whom
he
remembered
gave
a
cry
and
ran
to
meet
him
my
son
my
son
he
kissed
her
laughing
heavily
blowing
gusts
of
brandy
into
her
eyes
she
would
not
think
of
the
spirit
in
his
breath
her
hands
caressed
his
face
she
turned
him
to
the
light
to
see
if
he
were
changed
oh
george
you
re
that
thin
they
haven
t
fed
you
he
freed
himself
from
her
how
s
dad
he
asked
the
same
as
ever
poor
old
devil
he
said
she
drew
him
into
the
where

old
man
was
sitting

cried
excitedly

george

said
listlessly

could
not
keep
her
eyes
from

then
give

a
drop
of

while
she
was
filling

tankard
at
the
counter
old

and
another
labourer
from
the
pentre
who

been

a
wink

the
impulse
of
hiding
himself

malpas

she
gave
george
his
beer
and
he
settled
down
to
it

two
labourers

spasmodically

the
bar

said

put
that
on
his
back
he
put
down
his
tankard
with
another
oath
one
of
the
drinkers
in
the
bar
knocked
at
the
counter
keep
still
till
i
m
back
george
i
won
t
be
a
minute
she
said
get

another
pint
then
george
grumbled
she
took
his
tankard
and
having
given
the
labourers
their
change
and
wished
them
she
brought
it
back
to
him
filled
god
would
forgive
her
this
sin
even
if
he
were
drunk
she
wanted
to
keep
him
at
the
buffalo
for
she
dreaded
abner
s
strength
when
she
returned
he
was
still
on
his
feet
talking
indistinctly
to
the
old
man
who
was
shaken
by
a
fit
of
coughing
that
choked
him
she
thumped
his
back
that
s
right
dad
said
george
better
out
than
in
the
joke
appeared
to
please
him
she
drew
him
down
gently
to
his
chair
and
gave
him
the
tankard
sit
down
my
dear
she
said
i

to
talk
to

said
george
obstinately
let
me
get
at
him
that
s
what
i
want
let
me
get
at
the
dirty
pair
of
them
she
bent
over
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
the
money
george
she
said
where
did
you
put
it
she
told
me
you
hadn
t
hid
it
in
the
house
but
i
reckon
she
lied
to
me
or
they
couldn
t
have
lived
all
this
time
with
him
out
of
work
they
must
have
got
at
it
where
did
you
put
it

son
he
stared
at
her
with
affected
stupidity
what
money

pounds

of
my
box
i
guessed
it

over

she
came
to
his
arms
weakly
sobbing
and
clung
to
him

he
said
thickly

she
clung
to
him
he
gave
her
a
push
and
she
went
over
into
the
hearth
with
a
clatter
of
the
old
man
began
to
wail
in
a
voice
help
help
shut
your
damned
mouth
you
said
george
he
blundered
out
into
the
bar
knocking
against
the
end
of
the
counter
and
bringing
down
a
tray
of
glasses
with
a
crash
a
freakish
idea
seized
him
he
took
the
key
from
the
door
and
locked
it
on
the
outside
he
shook
with
laughter
at
the
joke
a
young
moon
sank
slowly
over
the
misty
woodland
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
solemnly
turned
over
the
packet
of
banknotes
in
his
pocket
for
luck
drunk
not
he
he
was
sharp
enough
to
think
of
everything
he
turned
his
uncertain
steps
toward
wolfpits
before
him
with
half
an
hour
in
hand
old
drew
went
pounding
along
the
same
road
as
fast
as
his
rheumatic
knees
would
let
him
he
reached
wolfpits
breathless
and
knocked
violently
at
mary
s
kitchen
door
she
was
upstairs
putting
the
children
to
bed
morgan
was
tucked
in
already
and
gladys
was
having
her
hair
brushed
panic
seized
mary
when
she
heard
the
old
man
s
knock
those
rapid
blows
seemed
to
her
to
herald
catastrophe
she
ran
downstairs
and
came
to
the
door
with
an
ashen
face
hey
missus
drew
panted
be
abner
in
there
with

said
relieved
then
as
a
new
fear
chilled
her
isn
t
he

the
pentre

drew
slowly
regaining
his
breath
and
leaning
on
the
doorpost
i
ve
been
a
driving
they
bullocks
to
llandwlas
she
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
a
little
earlier
than
abner
s
usual
hour
of
return
better
wait
if

want

the
old

impressively

mamble
her

i
must
wait
for
george
she
said
an
inspiration
came
to
her
she
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
scribbled
a
note
to
abner
telling
him
that
george
was
coming
begging
him
for
her
sake
to
keep
out
of
the
way
until
she
had
seen
him
then
she
called
upstairs
gladys
and
the
child
came
down
with
her
hair
plaited
for
the
night
come
here
my
darling
she
said

shoes

the
corner

gladys
thrilled
by
the
prospect
of
adventure
she
shivered

a
lovely
moon

mr
drew
just

at
the
bottom
of
the
drive
till

or

a
little
way
up
the
road

coat
she
helped
the
child
into
her
overcoat
and
kissed
her
gladys
took
the
note
won
t
our
abner
be
surprised
she
said
as
she
went
i
d
best

out

to
the
shops
in
lesswardine
i
d
rather
be
alone
when
he
comes
it
was
good
of
you
to
warn
he
left
her
and
she
waited
her
brain
followed
the
messenger
down
the
avenue
step
by
step
she
realised
that
the
most
awful
moment
of
her
life
was
upon
her
she
wondered
if
she
ought
to
pray
she
could
not
pray
what
right
had
she
a
guilty
woman
to
call
on
divine
help
she
must
fight
for
herself
she
looked
at
the
clock
barely
two
minutes
had
passed
since
she
had
looked
before
surely
abner
could
not
be
long
her
strained
ears
heard
steps
in
the
distance
she
peered
out
into
the
moonlight
two
dim
figures
were
visible
abner
in
his
obstinate
folly
had
seen
her
note
and
refused
her
warning
even
now
there
was
time
to
stop
him
she
dared
not
call
for
it
struck
her
that
george
might
well
be
coming
up
behind
him
she
stood
trembling
with
impatience
waiting
for
him
to
come
within
earshot
the
figures
of
the
man
and
the
child
became
more
distinct
his
gait
was
unsteady
but
too
fast
for
gladys
who
ran
at
his
side
he
carried
her
note
unfolded
the
paper
showed
white
in
the
moonlight
they
came
toward
her
and
she
saw
that
it
was
george
a
cry
came
from
her
lips
he
left
the
child
behind
him
stalked
straight
into
the
kitchen
and
flung
his
hat
on
the
table
he
was
as
pale
as
death
his
cropped
head
shaped
like
a
skull
the
walk
had
partially
sobered
him
go
straight
upstairs
gladys
she
called
it
s
dad
mam
i
give
him
abner
s
go
upstairs
as
i
tell
you
gladys
s
mouth
fell
why
mam
she
faltered
george
pulled
a
chair
toward
him
and
flopped
into
it
you
be
said
he
shouted
the
child
ran
upstairs
frightened
george
sat
on
his
eyes
staring
savagely
at
her
out
of
his
sunken
orbits
well
mary
he
said
at
last
this
is
a
bloody
fine
game
she
could
not
speak
for
her
increasing
terror
she
had
never
felt
so
frightened
of
him
in
her
life
he
looks
like
a
criminal
she
thought
speak
up
he
said
what
ve
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
what
s
the
meaning
of
this
he
held
out
her
note
tell
him
to
keep
away
would
you
you
dirty
bitch
george
she
said
you
mustn
t
believe
all
people
tell
you
you
know
your
mother
s
against
me
hold
your
noise
about
my
mother
she
s
a
good
woman
she
is
and
a
good
wife
the
likes
of
you
s
not
fit
to
go
near
her
i
know
what
s
been
going
on
here
without
her
telling
me
sleeping
with
the
lodger
don
t
you
deny
it
or
i
ll
bash
your
mouth
in
for
you
never
george
never
she
cried
passionately
righteous
i
swear
by
god
as
i
m
standing
here
it
never
came
to
you
can
swear
by
the
devil
for
all
i
care
i
ve
finished
with
you
it
s
him
i
want
his
voice
left
him
he
cleared
his
throat
and
spat
viciously
in
the
fire
mary
pulled
her
senses
together
george
she
said
have
you
ever
known
me
tell
you
a
lie
i
never
knew
a
woman
who
wouldn
t
he
said
with
a
laugh
she
let
his
speech
pass
imagine
the
hard
times
we
ve
had
she
went
on
and
not
so
much
as
a
word
from
you
not
a
penny
in
the
house
the
way
he
s
worked
for
us
and
suffered
for
us
and
all
for
the
sake
of
the
word
he
gave
you
there
s
not
a
man
in
a
million
who
d
have
done
it
and
all
for
nothing
all
for
nothing
he
mocked
tell
that
to
some
one
else
without
him
we
should
have
starved
me
and
the
children
can
t
you
see
that
for
yourself
and
yet
you
believe
the
first
word
that
s
spoken
against
him
and
me
you
ought
to
go
down
on
your
knees
to
him
and
thank
him
for
what
he
s
done
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
you
d
have
found
us
all
in
the
workhouse
george
you
must
believe
me
oh
shut
your
bloody
mouth
he
said
rising
clumsily
george
you
must
she
repeated
she
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
but
he
pushed
her
away
both
of
them
heard
a
step
on
the
path
she
made
a
last
desperate
effort
george
if
you
touch
him
she
cried
if
you
abner
stood
in
the
doorway
his
face
was
solemn
and
heavily
lined
the
sight
of
malpas
did
not
seem
to
disturb
him
hallo
george
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
how
goes
it
don
t
you
talk
to
me
said
george
threateningly
you
wait
till
i
ve
told
you
what
i
think
of
you
you
damned
swine
abner
flushed
steady
george
go
steady
we
ve
got
to
talk
this
over
you
sit
there
s
a
sight
too
much
talk
about
the
both
of
you
george
snarled
when
you
ve
broke
up
a
man
s
home
behind
his
back
and
then
tell
him
to
take
a
seat
in
it
i
m
going
to
give
you
your
lesson
before
you
get
kicked
out
he
made
a
threatening
movement
toward
abner
who
watched
him
closely
spider
came
dancing
into
the
room
she
leapt
up
at
abner
with
little
yelps
of
joy
at
his
return
licking
his
hand
at
this
sight
the
anger
that
smouldered
in
george
s
brain
leapt
into
flame
not
only
the
wife
and
the
kids
he
cried
you
ve
got
round
the
lot
of
them
even
the
bleeding
dog
he
snatched
up
the
poker
and
hit
out
at
spider
abner
took
the
blow
on
his
thigh
here
drop
that
he
cried
but
george
s
senses
had
left
him
he
flew
at
abner
raining
desperate
blows
at
his
head
george
you
ll
kill
him
mary
screamed
abner
had
picked
up
a
chair
and
protected
himself
as
best
he
could
for
a
second
the
two
men
stood
staring
at
one
another
panting
for
breath
then
another
gust
of
anger
swept
over
george
and
he
made
for
abner
again
mary
tried
to
throw
herself
between
them
but
abner
flung
her
aside
the
legs
of
the
chair
were
splintered
under
george
s
blows
he
continued
to
lash
out
and
it
was
as
much
as
abner
could
do
to
defend
himself
he
saw
that
the
man
s
flushed
brain
meant
murder
nothing
less
somehow
he
must
put
an
end
to
this
madness
george
s
hobnails
slithered
on
the
stone
flags
abner
took
his
chance
and
timed
his
blow
george
went
down
with
a
groan
his
poker
sang
like
a
tuning
fork
on
the
floor
abner
abner
what
have
you
done
mary
cried
she
ran
to
george
and
bent
over
him
pulling
up
his
head
abner
with
black
blood
dripping
from
a
bruised
vein
on
his
forehead
stood
back
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
with
his
violent
breathing
he
still
held
his
chair
uplifted
it
was
him
or
me
he
panted
he
s
dead
you
ve
killed
him
not
he
that
sort
don
t
but
he
himself
was
anxious
for
a
moment
and
stooped
over
george
s
body
breathing
heavily
no
he
s
all
right
he
said
just
knocked
out
i
ve
been
like
that
what
can
we
do
she
cried
staring
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
leave
him
alone
he
ll
come
i
sent
you
a
note
by
gladys
she
said
inconsequently
he
met
her
and
took
it
off
her
i
d
told

and
put
your
things
on
i
ll
keep
an
eye
on
him
get
the
children
dressed
and
she
stared
at
him
as
though
she
couldn
t
take
in
what
he
was
saying
she
was
still
holding
one
of
george
s
inanimate
hands
that
she
had
clutched
in
her
first
anxiety
dress
them
abner
what
do
you
mean

time
we
cleared

t
but
i
couldn

arm

the
sooner

abner

of

that

if

my
dear
i

t

tell

come
round
sober
if

at
him
anguished
abner

love

you
understand
they
ll
follow
us
they
re
bound
to
the
police
it

no
good
thinking
of
that
he
said
she
began
crying
softly
there
on
the
floor
above
the
prostrate
body
her
fingers
mechanically
stroked
george
s
hand
the
action
irritated
abner
he
could
not
look
at
her
he
took
a
cloth
from
the
table
and
mopped
the
blood
that
was
running
into
his
eyes
he
propped
himself
up
with
the
table
edge
for
he
was
still
giddy
from
george
s
blow
on
his
temple
a
sudden
vision
came
to
him
of
another
kitchen
another
man
lying
on
the
floor
another
woman
crying
the
room
swam
before
him
he
steadied
himself
and
sank
down
into
a
chair
the
sense
of
time
left
him
he
could
not
be
certain
where
he
was
or
in
what
period
of
his
life
a
shrill
singing
noise
was
in
his
ears
through
it
distantly
he
heard
the
clear
tone
of
a
clock
striking
eight
and
this
recalled
him
to
life
to
the
room
that
he
had
lost
in
a
blur
of
confused
memories
to
the
sound
of
mary
s
sobbing
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
speaking
but
could
only
repeat
the
last
words
that
had
left
an
echo
in
his
memory
it
s
no
good
what
he
heard
her
ask
wasting
time
over
this
if
you
re
coming
you
must
come
now
now
or
she
neither
moved
nor
answered
him
he
felt
sorry
for
her
bent
over
her
pressed
her
to
him
she
turned
her
face
away
i
can
t
abner
not
now
she
whispered
i
can
t
think
i
can
t
feel
oh
why
didn
t
he
kill
me
why
didn
t
he
kill
me
he
would
have
lifted
her
to
her
feet
but
she
lay
a
dead
weight
in
his
arms
all
power
of
volition
had
left
her
she
sank
back
again
limply
shaking
her
head
from
side
to
side
her
hair
had
become
loose
it
hung
down
over
her
shoulder
abner
felt
that
he
must
do
something
to
break
the
paralysing
spell
that
held
them
i
m
going
mary
he
said
i
can
t
stay
let
me
help
you
up
come
along
now
she
shook
her
head
it
s
no
use
there
s
naught
left
for
you
here
that
i
can
see
it
s
only
you
and
the
kids
i
want
to
look
she
could
only
go
on
sobbing
it
s
no
use
it
s
no
use
well
i
m
no
judge
maybe
yo
m
right
he
said
he
turned
from
her
and
went
upstairs
to
collect
a
few
of
his
belongings
on
his
way
down
again
gladys
came
timidly
to
the
door
of
mary
s
room
and
called
his
name
her
piteous
fragility
touched
him
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
where
are
you
going
abner
she
whispered
where
s
mam
he
picked
the
child
up
and
carried
her
to
her
cot
telling
her
that
she
must
be
a
good
girl
and
go
to
sleep
morgan
was
sitting
up
with
his
fingers
in
his
eyes
crying
mechanically
you
look
after
our
morgan
till
mam
comes
he
told
her
he
came
down
into
the
kitchen
mary
he
said
she
did
not
answer
he
went
to
her
and
put
his
arms
round
her
neck
lass
he
said
her
sobbing
increased
but
she
would
not
raise
her
head
he
wanted
to
pick
her
up
in
his
arms
as
he
had
picked
up
gladys
to
carry
her
away
with
him
but
he
knew
it
was
useless
he
kissed
her
again
then
rose
and
went
to
the
door
closing
it
softly
behind
him
the
cold
air
revived
him
he
drew
it
gratefully
into
his
lungs
he
was
conscious
of
a
strange
physical
lightening
as
though
a
material
load
had
slipped
from
his
shoulders
the
chapter
behind
him
wolfpits
lay
brooding
in
the
moonlight
on
its
departed
life
he
did
not
turn
to
look
at
it
and
in
half
an
hour
had
reached
the
main
road
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
going
but
turned
mechanically
toward
the
east
the
quarter
from
which
he
had
first
entered
the
hills
at
present
it
was
not
in
him
to
strike
out
a
way
for
himself
he
could
do
no
more
than
retrace
his
steps
he
walked
fast
impelled
by
an
unconscious
energy
and
all
the
time
one
dominant
thought
possessed
his
brain
curse
women
curse
all
women
curse
the
bloody
lot
of
them
he
passed
through
chapel
green
and
mainstone
dead
villages
both
not
a
light
in
their
windows
as
dead
as
wolfpits
the
poplar
under
which
he
had
trysted
with
susie
hung
above
him
the
moonlight
broke
in
ripples
on
its
lofty
crown
he
saw
nothing
at
all
heard
nothing
but
the
steady
rhythm
of
his
feet
and
the
monotonous
burden
of
words
in
his
brain
the
moon
sank
now
the
road
was
only
faintly
luminous
with
the
reflected
pallor
of
the
sky
he
heard
a
new
noise
behind
him
and
the
lamps
of
a
swept
a
slanting
beam
that
carried
his
shadow
into
the
hedge
the
noise
of
the
engine
became
distinct
a
van
loomed
up
above
the
two
blinding
eyes
of
the
headlights
he
stood
aside
to
let
it
pass
but
as
its
roar
overtook
him
his
own
voice
gave
a
hail
that
was
swept
along
in
the
draught
he
did
not
know
why
he
had
shouted
but
a
second
later
the
car
pulled
up
with
grinding
brakes
striking
sparks
of
fire
from
the
road
he
ran
after
it
what
s
up
the
driver
called
it
was
a
man
whom
abner
had
sometimes
met
at
llandwlas
station
when
he
was
driving
the
milk
from
the
dyke
oh
it
s
you
is
it
he
said
want
a
lift
abner
caught
him
up
and
climbed
into
the
seat
next
his
they
set
off
again
whirling
like
a
tornado
through
the
darkness
they
could
only
speak
to
each
other
by
shouting
for
the
engine
was
old
and
full
of
rattles
and
the
jangled
behind
drop
you
lesswardine
bridge
the
driver
shouted
drop
me
in
hell
if
you
like
abner
replied
what
about
shrewsbury
to
be
going
on
with
that
ll
do
me
the
roar
and
vibration
filled
abner
s
aching
brain
they
turned
northward
at
craven
arms
and
plunged
on
between
the
rising
masses
of
the
mynd
and
caer
caradoc
the
hotels
of
church
stretton
burned
like
a
constellation
in
the
darkness
on
their
left
the
lights
of
shrewsbury
appeared
that
s
good
going
bain
t
it
said
the
driver
with
a
laugh
he
refused
the
drink
that
abner
offered
him
and
set
him
down
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
abner
s
head
was
splitting
he
staggered
into
a
pub
and
drank
three
double
whiskies
straight
off
what
was
there
for
a
man
to
do
but
drink
he
passed
into
the
main
streets
of
the
town
after
the
silence
and
darkness
of
wolfpits
it
seemed
to
him
a
city
of
palaces
sparkling
with
light
he
moved
in
a
dazed
manner
through
the
streets
had
another
drink
and
began
to
feel
better
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
set
out
he
felt
capable
of
a
determination
he
resolved
as
far
as
his
money
would
let
him
to
get
drunk
he
sampled
several
pubs
and
at
last
found
one
to
his
fancy
there
in
a
small
and
crowded
bar
he
settled
himself
in
a
corner
next
the
counter
and
ordered
his
drinks
methodically
nobody
took
much
notice
of
him
for
most
of
the
men
who
had
gathered
there
were
regular
customers
who
came
in
every
night
the
only
person
with
whom
he
had
anything
in
common
was
a
lanky
labourer
with
a
small
head
and
dark
eyes
who
sat
at
a
table
opposite
to
him
drinking
beer
the
evening
wore
on
abner
was
no
longer
conscious
of
such
details
the
only
things
that
detached
themselves
from
the
warm
rosy
confusion
were
certain
points
of
light
the
stopper
of
a
decanter
that
flashed
rays
of
ruby
and
a
brooch
of
brilliants
that
the
barmaid
wore
a
medal
hanging
on
the
of
the
labourer
opposite
to
him
abner
s
fancy
played
with
these
lights
childishly
fascinated
he
heard
not
a
word
of
the
conversation
that
buzzed
around
him
keeping
only
enough
of
his
senses
to
ask
and
pay
for
his
drinks
it
was
nearly
ten
o
clock
when
another
figure
entered
the
bar
a
man
dressed
in
a
military
uniform
with
staring
eyes
and
a
red
face
that
appeared
to
be
transfixed
by
the
skewer
of
a
waxed
moustache
he
carried
a
cane
under
his
arm
his
tunic
fitted
his
back
like
a
glove
and
in
his
cap
he
wore
a
raffish
bunch
of
ribbons
he
shook
hands
with
the
barmaid
swept
the
room
with
a
curious
glance
and
settled
down
with
his
drink
at
the
elbow
of
the
lanky
labourer
he
spoke
so
loudly
and
with
such
an
accent
of
gentility
that
his
voice
could
be
heard
above
the
rumour
of
the
bar
he
slapped
his
neighbour
on
the
back
out
of
work
he
said
there
s
no
need
for
any
one
to
be
out
of
work
in
these
days
i
know
the
kind
of
work
you
chaps
get
and
damn
me
if
i
can
see
how
you
put
up
with
it
now
what
have
you
been
earning
on
the
farm
fifteen
shilling
a
week
i
guessed
as
much
and
ten
hours
work
a
day
that
s
a
fine
life
for
a
man
that
s
a
damned
fine
life
i
know
what
it
is
my
boy
i
ve
had
some
of
it
but
that
was
many
years
ago
i
had
the
sense
to
join
the
army
the
good
old
and
i
ve
lived
the
life
of
a
gentleman
ever
since
that
s
what
you
ought
to
do
take
the
king
s
shilling
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
missing

that

a
fine
place
now
you
should
see
the
women
in
cyprus
hey
women
he
broke
into
an
obscene
laugh
the
last
word
echoed
late
in
abner
s
brain
women
he
heard
himself
mumble
curse
the
lot
of
them
that
s
what
i
the
sergeant
turned
to
him
delighted
to
have
dragged
another
person
into
the
conversation
the
old
hands
nudged
each
other
and
smiled
no
that
s
going
too
far
my
boy
he
said
you
don
t
know
women
till
you
ve
rolled
about
the
world
a
bit
there
s
many
a
chap
that
s
been
disappointed
with
them
in
england
that
s
gone
into
the
army
and
changed
his
mind
now
you
re
another
like
my
friend
here
that
s
cut
out
for
a
gentleman
s
life
there
s
no
saying
that
a
fine
chap
like
you
mightn
t
go
a
lot
farther
than
i
ever
did
athletics
count
a
lot
in
the
army
football
cricket
and
that
upon
my
word
it
s
just
like
a
long
holiday
and
that
s
the
truth
a
chap
like
you
might
be
an
officer
before
he
finished
with
he
crossed
to
abner
took
his
arm
and
whispered
in
his
ear
if
you
went
out
to
egypt
where
the
second
battalion
is
now
i
could
show
you
some
places
in
as
would
soon
change
your
mind
about
women
god
it
s
a
gentleman
s
life
egypt
with
all
the
blacks
to
wait
on
you
as
if
you
was
a
lord
and
whisky
twopence
a
glass
in
the
canteen
women
i
d
learn
you
about
i
ve
learned
all
i
want
about
said
abner
sullenly
but
he
allowed
the
sergeant
to
stand
him
a
drink
and
found
as
the
time
went
on
that
he
was
as
good
a
fellow
as
he
had
ever
met
he
and
the
dark
labouring
man
who
sat
at
their
table
when
abner
s
money
was
finished
the
sergeant
behaved
like
a
friend
to
him
money
what
s
money
he
said
and
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
handful
of
silver
that
fell
in
a
tinkling
cascade
on
the
table
they
sat
and
talked
the
sergeant
kept
the
ball
rolling
patting
abner
on
the
back
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
with
a
friendly
grip
he
passed
through
a
phase
of
exaltation
into
one
of
contented
stupor
in
which
his
only
anxiety
was
where
he
should
find
lodging
for
the
night
don
t
you
worry
about
that
said
the
sergeant
i
ll
see
you
through
my
boy
you
trust
me
there
s
just
time
for
so
in
a
flash
of
brilliant
light
the
evening
passed
a
policeman
put
in
his
head
at
the
door
and
disappeared
abner
found
his
new
friend
helping
him
to
his
feet
he
laughed
weakly
for
he
found
that
he
could
not
stand
steady
does
it
my
boy
steady
does
it
you
holt
on
to
me
and
you
ll
be
all
right
god
you
re
a
tidy
weight
they
passed
laughing
through
an
uncomfortably
narrow
doorway
and
out
into
the
road
street
lamps
danced
before
them
in
an
eddying
line
the
road
had
a
resilient
velvety
feeling
like
no
other
road
that
abner
had
known
they
walked
arm
in
arm
the
three
of
them
abner
felt
himself
impelled
to
stop
suddenly
and
take
the
sergeant
into
his
confidence
look
here
kid
he
said
i
m
boozed
not
a
bit
of
it
said
the
sergeant
with
an
encouraging
slap
on
the
back
here
you
ll
look
after
me
said
abner
anxiously
you
bet
i
will
you
re
a
good
pal
kid
said
abner
straight
you
are
half
an
hour
later
he
threw
himself
with
relief
upon
a
mattress
that
was
built
up
of
three
distinct
slabs
and
pulled
a
gray
blanket
over
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
host
of
lights
that
swam
before
them
he
heard
the
voices
of
men
buzzing
round
him
and
heavy
regular
steps
on
the
stone
flags
all
he
cared
about
now
was
sleep
he
fell
into
a
drugged
slumber
haunted
by
many
dreams
he
dreamed
of
halesby
of
old
mrs
moseley
s
room
and
susan
wade
sitting
demurely
at
the
foot
of
her
aunt
s
bed
alice
put
in
her
head
and
called
him
telling
him
that
his
father
was
dead
and
that
she
could
not
do
without
him
he
got
up
and
followed
her
with
tiger
prancing
at
his
heels
i
can
t
abear
dogs
abner
she
cried
all
his
old
resentment
against
her
rose
up
in
him
and
he
would
have
told
her
what
he
thought
of
her
had
not
mick
connor
appeared
at
that
moment
and
shouted
his
name
come
along
wud
you
said
mick
why
would
you
be
bothering
your
head
about
the
likes
of
her
it
s
time
we
were
looking
for
a
drop
in
nagle
s
they
walked
on
over
twilight
fields
talking
of
old
times
go
aisy
round
the
corner
mick
warned
him
for
the
ould
devil
of
a
policeman
s
got
his
eye
on
us
they
went
round
the
edge
of
the
woodland
on
tiptoe
and
there
sure
enough
stood
bastard
with
a
face
as
white
as
death
and
a
thin
stream
of
blood
trickling
from
his
nose
he
s
dead
said
abner
don
t
look
at
him
our
george
killed
him
don
t
you
believe
it
mick
replied
and
as
he
spoke
bastard
turned
and
stared
at
them
with
blank
eyes
abner
set
off
running
he
knew
that
his
only
chance
was
to
run
as
hard
as
he
could
he
plunged
into
a
close
lane
smelling
of
elder
trees
and
nettles
now
he
knew
where
he
was
this
was
the
dark
and
if
he
kept
on
running
he
would
emerge
in
safety
on
the
above
mawne
colliery
just
below
the
cherry
orchard
even
now
he
could
hear
the
thudding
of
hammers
at
willises
forge
bastard
was
gaining
on
him
pounding
along
behind
him
but
a
man
stood
in
his
path
and
barred
the
way
at
first
he
thought
it
was
his
father
but
a
sudden
revelation
showed
him
that
it
was
george
malpas
george
malpas
deathly
white
under
his
prison
crop
and
armed
with
a
poker
they
closed
and
struggled
it
was
a
desperate
business
for
george
managed
to
keep
on
battering
his
head
with
the
poker
and
mary
in
her
strange
tragic
beauty
clutched
at
his
arm
he
knew
that
he
was
done
for
fell
with
his
hands
locked
about
george
s
throat
bastard
seized
him
from
behind
and
he
woke
in
prison
surely
this
could
be
nothing
else
a
long
stone
room
lit
by
a
single
burning
low
and
blue
he
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
the
whole
room
was
spread
with
mattresses
on
which
were
lying
figures
covered
with
gray
blankets
like
his
own
his
neighbour
a
man
who
snored
heavily
and
clutched
at
his
hair
with
his
hands
gave
a
groan
this
could
not
be
a
dream
through
the
thudding
of
hammers
in
his
head
his
consciousness
painfully
emerged
he
remembered
that
he
had
come
to
shrewsbury
the
night
before
that
he
had
slunk
into
a
pub
and
drunk
heavily
where
was
he
now
in
a
workhouse
a
hospital
a
a
jail
he
could
not
guess
in
any
case
it
hurt
his
head
to
think
he
tried
to
get
his
bearings
he
had
gone
to
bed
in
his
boots
that
was
natural
enough
he
felt
for
his
new
watch
it
was
not
there
he
swore
under
his
breath
not
at
the
unknown
people
who
had
stolen
it
but
at
his
evil
luck
he
supposed
that
they
had
stripped
him
of
his
money
that
it
mattered
he
searched
his
left
hand
trouser
pocket
to
see
if
anything
remained
not
a
penny
he
laughed
to
himself
in
the
other
pocket
to
his
astonishment
his
fingers
lighted
on
a
single
coin
how
the
devil
had
it
got
there
he
fished
it
out
then
propped
himself
on
his
elbow
and
held
it
up
in
the
faint
light
it
was
a
new
shilling
he
stared
at
it
then
spat
on
it
for
luck
so
tired
and
wretched
beyond
words
he
turned
over
on
his
side
wrapped
the
blanket
round
his
head
and
went
to
sleep
