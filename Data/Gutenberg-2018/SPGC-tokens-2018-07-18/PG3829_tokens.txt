love
among
the
chickens
by
wodehouse
dedication
to
townend
dear
bill
i
have
never
been
much
of
a
lad
for
the
to
but
for
whose
sympathy
and
encouragement
this
book
would
never
have
been
written
type
of
dedication
it
sounds
so
but
in
the
case
of
love
among
the
chickens
it
is
unavoidable
it
was
not
so
much
that
you
sympathised
and
encouraged
where
you
really
came
out
strong
was
that
you
gave
me
the
stuff
i
like
people
who
sympathise
with
me
i
am
grateful
to
those
who
encourage
me
but
the
man
to
whom
i
raise
the
wodehouse
hat
owing
to
the
increased
cost
of
living
the
same
old
brown
one
i
had
last
year
it
is
being
complained
of
on
all
sides
but
the
public
must
bear
it
like
men
till
the
straw
hat
season
comes
round
i
say
the
man
to
whom
i
raise
this
venerable
relic
is
the
man
who
gives
me
the
material
sixteen
years
ago
my
william
when
we
were
young
and
spritely
lads
when
you
were
a
tricky
and
i
a
fast
bowler
when
your
head
was
covered
with
hair
and
my
list
of
hobbies
in
who
who
included
boxing
i
received
from
you
one
morning
about
thirty
foolscap
pages
giving
me
the
details
of
your
friend
adventures
on
his
devonshire
chicken
farm
round
these
i
wove
as
funny
a
plot
as
i
could
but
the
book
stands
or
falls
by
the
stuff
you
gave
me
about
ukridge
the
things
that
actually
happened
you
will
notice
that
i
have
practically
the
book
there
was
some
pretty
bad
work
in
it
and
it
had
dated
as
an
instance
of
the
way
in
which
the
march
of
modern
civilisation
has
left
the
edition
behind
i
may
mention
that
on

was
able
to
make
ukridge

a
letter
with
a
postscript
a
gentleman
called
to
see
you
when
you
were
out
last
night
sir
said
medley
my
landlady
removing
the
last
of
the
breakfast
things
yes
i
said
in
my
affable
way
a
gentleman
said
medley
meditatively
with
a
very
powerful
voice
caruso
sir
i
said
did
he
leave
a
name
yes
sir
mr
ukridge
oh
my
sainted
aunt
sir
nothing
nothing
thank
you
sir
said
medley
withdrawing
from
the
presence
ukridge
oh
hang
it
i
had
not
met
him
for
years
and
glad
as
i
am
as
a
general
thing
to
see
the
friends
of
my
youth
when
they
drop
in
for
a
chat
i
doubted
whether
i
was
quite
equal
to
ukridge
at
the
moment
a
stout
fellow
in
both
the
physical
and
moral
sense
of
the
words
he
was
a
trifle
too
jumpy
for
a
man
of
my
cloistered
and
intellectual
life
especially
as
just
now
i
was
trying
to
plan
out
a
new
novel
a
tricky
job
demanding
complete
quiet
and
seclusion
it
had
always
been
my
experience
that
when
ukridge
was
around
things
began
to
happen
swiftly
and
violently
rendering
meditation
impossible
ukridge
was
the
sort
of
man
who
asks
you
out
to
dinner
borrows
the
money
from
you
to
pay
the
bill
and
winds
up
the
evening
by
embroiling
you
in
a
fight
with
a
cabman
i
have
gone
to
covent
garden
balls
with
ukridge
and
found
myself
legging
it
down
henrietta
street
in
the
grey
dawn
pursued
by
infuriated
costermongers
i
wondered
how
he
had
got
my
address
and
on
that
problem
light
was
immediately
cast
by
medley
who
returned
bearing
an
envelope
it
came
by
the
morning
post
sir
but
it
was
left
at
number
twenty
by
mistake
oh
thank
you
thank
you
sir
said
medley
i
recognised
the
handwriting
the
letter
which
bore
a
devonshire
postmark
was
from
an
artist
friend
of
mine
one
lickford
who
was
at
present
on
a
sketching
tour
in
the
west
i
had
seen
him
off
at
waterloo
a
week
before
and
i
remember
that
i
had
walked
away
from
the
station
wishing
that
i
could
summon
up
the
energy
to
pack
and
get
off
to
the
country
somewhere
i
hate
london
in
july
the
letter
was
a
long
one
but
it
was
the
postscript
which
interested
me
most
by
the
way
at
yeovil
i
ran
into
an
old
friend
of
ours
stanley
featherstonehaugh
ukridge
of
all
people
as
large
as
life
quite
six
foot
two
and
tremendously
filled
out
i
thought
he
was
abroad
the
last
i
heard
of
him
was
that
he
had
started
for
buenos
ayres
in
a
cattle
ship
with
a
borrowed
pipe
by
way
of
luggage
it
seems
he
has
been
in
england
for
some
time
i
met
him
in
the
at
yeovil
station
i
was
waiting
for
a
down
train
he
had
changed
on
his
way
to
town
as
i
opened
the
door
i
heard
a
huge
voice
entreating
the
lady
behind
the
bar
to
it
in
a
pewter
and
there
was
in
a
villainous
old
suit
of
grey
flannels
i
swear
it
was
the
one
he
had
on
last
time
i
saw
him
with
tacked
on
to
his
ears
with
wire
as
usual
and
a
couple
of
inches
of
bare
neck
showing
between
the
bottom
of
his
collar
and
the
top
of
his
coat
you
remember
how
he
could
never
get
a
stud
to
do
its
work
he
also
wore
a
mackintosh
though
it
was
a
blazing
day
he
greeted
me
with
effusive
shouts
would
hear
of
my
standing
the
racket
insisted
on
being
host
when
we
had
finished
he
fumbled
in
his
pockets
looked
pained
and
surprised
and
drew
me
aside
here
licky
old
horse
he
said
know
i
never
borrow
money
against
my
principles
but
i
have
a
couple
of
bob
can
you
my
dear
good
fellow
oblige
me
with
a
couple
of
bob
till
next
tuesday
i
tell
you
what
i
do
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
i
let
you
have
this
producing
a
beastly
little
threepenny
bit
with
a
hole
in
it
which
he
had
probably
picked
up
in
the
street
until
i
can
pay
you
back
this
is
of
more
value
to
me
than
i
can
well
express
licky
my
boy
a
very
very
dear
friend
gave
it
to
me
when
we
parted
years
ago
it
a
wrench
still
no
no
you
must
take
it
you
must
take
it
licky
old
man
shake
hands
old
horse
shake
hands
my
boy
he
then
tottered
to
the
bar
deeply
moved
and
paid
up
out
of
the
five
shillings
which
he
had
made
it
as
an
he
asked
after
you
and
said
you
were
one
of
the
noblest
men
on
earth
i
gave
him
your
address
not
being
able
to
get
out
of
it
but
if
i
were
you
i
should
fly
while
there
is
yet
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
advice
was
good
and
should
be
followed
i
needed
a
change
of
air
london
may
have
suited
doctor
johnson
but
in
the
summer
time
it
is
not
for
the
ordinary
man
what
i
wanted
to
enable
me
to
give
the
public
of
my
best
as
the
reviewer
of
a
weekly
paper
dealing
with
my
last
work
had
expressed
a
polite
hope
that
i
would
continue
to
do
was
a
little
haven
in
the
country
somewhere
i
rang
the
bell
sir
said
medley
i
going
away
for
a
bit
i
said
yes
sir
i
do
know
where
i
send
you
the
address
so
that
you
can
forward
letters
yes
sir
and
if
ukridge
calls
again
at
this
point
a
thunderous
knocking
on
the
front
door
interrupted
me
something
seemed
to
tell
me
who
was
at
the
end
of
that
knocker
i
heard
medley
footsteps
pass
along
the
hall
there
was
the
click
of
the
latch
a
volume
of
sound
rushed
up
the
stairs
is

in
where
is
he
show
me
the
old
horse
where
is
the
man
of
wrath
exhibit
the

there
followed
a
violent
crashing
on
the
stairs

the

where
are
you
laddie
garnet
garnet
stanley
featherstonehaugh
ukridge
was
in
my
midst
chapter
ii
and
ukridge
i
have
often
thought
that
who
who
though
a
bulky
and
volume
omits
too
many
of
england
greatest
men
it
is
not
comprehensive
enough
i
am
in
it
nestling
among
the
g

henry
garnet
vicar
of
much
middlefold

but
if
you
search
among
the
u
for
ukridge
stanley
featherstonehaugh
details
of
whose
tempestuous
career
would
make
really
interesting
reading
you
find
no
mention
of
him
it
seems
unfair
though
i
imagine
ukridge
bears
it
with
fortitude
that
man
has
had
a
lifetime
training
in
bearing
things
with
fortitude
he
seemed
in
his
customary
jovial
spirits
now
as
he
dashed
into
the
room
clinging
on
to
the
which
even
wire
rarely
kept
stable
for
two
minutes
together
my
dear
old
man
he
shouted
springing
at
me
and
seizing
my
hand
in
the
grip
like
the
bite
of
a
horse
how
you
old
buck
this
is
good
by
jove
this
is
fine
what
he
dashed
to
the
door
and
looked

looking
just
the
same
as
ever
devilish
handsome
fellow
you
be
glad
you
came
when
you
see
him
beats
the
zoo
hollow
there
appeared
round
the
corner
of
ukridge
a
young
woman
she
paused
in
the
doorway
and
smiled
pleasantly
garny
old
horse
said
ukridge
with
some
pride
this
is
the
pride
of
the
home
companion
of
joys
and
sorrows
and
all
the
rest
of
it
in
fact
in
a
burst
of
confidence
my
wife
i
bowed
awkwardly
the
idea
of
ukridge
married
was
something
too
overpowering
to
be
readily
assimilated
buck
up
old
horse
said
ukridge
encouragingly
he
had
a
painful
habit
of
addressing
all
and
sundry
by
that
title
in
his
days
at
one
period
of
his
vivid
career
he
and
i
had
been
colleagues
on
the
staff
of
a
private
school
he
had
made
use
of
it
interviewing
the
parents
of
new
pupils
and
the
latter
had
gone
away
as
a
rule
with
a
feeling
that
this
must
be
either
the
easy
manner
of
genius
or
due
to
alcohol
and
hoping
for
the
best
he
also
used
it
to
perfect
strangers
in
the
streets
and
on
one
occasion
had
been
heard
to
address
a
bishop
by
that
title
rendering
that
dignitary
as
baboo
jaberjee
would
put
it
with
gratification
surprised
to
find
me
married
what
garny
old
boy
sinking
his
voice
to
a
whisper
almost
inaudible
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
take
my
tip
go
and
jump
off
the
dock
yourself
you
feel
another
man
give
up
this
bachelor
business
a
mug
game
i
look
on
you
bachelors
as
excrescences
on
the
social
system
i
regard
you
old
man
purely
and
simply
as
a
wart
go
and
get
married
laddie
go
and
get
married
by
gad
i
forgotten
to
pay
the
cabby
lend
me
a
couple
of
bob
garny
old
chap
he
was
out
of
the
door
and
on
his
way
downstairs
before
the
echoes
of
his
last
remark
had
ceased
to
shake
the
window
i
was
left
to
entertain
ukridge
so
far
her
share
in
the
conversation
had
been
confined
to
the
pleasant
smile
which
was
apparently
her
chief
form
of
expression
nobody
talked
very
much
when
ukridge
was
present
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
armchair
looking
very
small
and
quiet
i
was
conscious
of
feeling
a
benevolent
pity
for
her
if
i
had
been
a
girl
i
would
have
preferred
to
marry
a
volcano
a
little
of
ukridge
as
his
former
head
master
had
once
said
in
a
moody
reflective
voice
went
a
very
long
way
you
and
stanley
have
known
each
other
a
long
time
have
you
said
the
object
of
my
commiseration
breaking
the
silence
yes
oh
yes
several
years
we
were
masters
at
the
same
school
ukridge
leaned
forward
with
round
shining
eyes
really
oh
how
nice
she
said
ecstatically
not
yet
to
judge
from
her
expression
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
had
she
found
any
disadvantages
attached
to
the
arduous
position
of
being
stanley
ukridge
he
a
wonderfully
versatile
man
i
said
i
believe
he
could
do
anything
he
have
a
jolly
good
try
have
you
ever
kept
fowls
asked
ukridge
with
apparent
irrelevance
i
had
not
she
looked
disappointed
i
was
hoping
you
might
have
had
some
experience
stanley
of
course
can
turn
his
hand
to
anything
but
i
think
experience
is
rather
a
good
thing
do
you
yes
but
i
have
bought
a
shilling
book
called
and
all
about
them
and
this
week
copy
of
about
it
a
paper
you
know
but
it
all
rather
hard
to
understand
you
see
we
but
here
is
stanley
he
will
explain
the
whole
thing
well
garny
old
horse
said
ukridge
the
room
after
another
energetic
passage
of
the
stairs
years
since
i
saw
you
still
buzzing
along
still
so
to
speak
buzzing
i
assented
i
was
reading
your
last
book
the
other
day
yes
i
said
gratified
how
did
you
like
it
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
laddie
i
did
get
beyond
the
third
page
because
the
scurvy
knave
at
the
bookstall
said
he
was
running
a
free
library
and
in
one
way
and
another
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
unpleasantness
still
it
seemed
bright
and
interesting
up
to
page
three
but
let
settle
down
and
talk
business
i
got
a
scheme
for
you
garny
old
man
yessir
the
idea
of
a
thousand
years
now
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
let
me
get
a
word
in
edgeways
he
sat
down
on
the
table
and
dragged
up
a
chair
as
a
then
he
took
off
his
wiped
them
the
wire
behind
his
ears
and
having
hit
a
brown
patch
on
the
knee
of
his
grey
flannel
trousers
several
times
in
the
apparent
hope
of
removing
it
resumed
about
fowls
the
subject
was
beginning
to
interest
me
it
showed
a
curious
tendency
to
creep
into
the
conversation
of
the
ukridge
family
i
want
you
to
give
me
your
undivided
attention
for
a
moment
i
was
saying
to
my
wife
as
we
came
here
the
man
clever
devil
garnet
full
of
ideas
did
i
millie
yes
dear
laddie
said
ukridge
impressively
we
are
going
to
keep
fowls
he
shifted
himself
farther
on
to
the
table
and
upset
the
never
mind
he
said
it
soak
in
it
good
for
the
texture
or
am
i
thinking
of
on
the
carpet
well
never
mind
listen
to
me
when
i
said
that
we
were
going
to
keep
fowls
i
did
mean
in
a
small
piffling
sort
of
way
two
cocks
and
a
couple
of
hens
and
a
for
a
we
are
going
to
do
it
on
a
large
scale
we
are
going
to
run
a
chicken
farm
a
chicken
farm
echoed
ukridge
with
an
affectionate
and
admiring
glance
at
her
husband
ah
i
said
feeling
my
responsibilities
as
chorus
a
chicken
farm
i
thought
it
all
over
laddie
and
it
as
clear
as
mud
no
expenses
large
profits
quick
returns
chickens
eggs
and
the
money
streaming
in
faster
than
you
can
bank
it
winter
and
summer
underclothing
my
bonny
boy
lined
with
crackling
bradbury
it
the
idea
of
a
lifetime
now
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
you
get
your
hen
one
hen
call
it
one
for
the
sake
of
argument
it
makes
my
calculations
clearer
very
well
then
harriet
the
hen
you
get
her
do
you
follow
me
so
far
yes
you
get
a
hen
i
told
you
garnet
was
a
dashed
bright
fellow
said
ukridge
approvingly
to
his
attentive
wife
notice
the
way
he
keeps
right
after
one
ideas
like
a
bloodhound
well
where
was
i
you
just
got
a
hen
exactly
the
hen
pricilla
the
pullet
well
it
lays
an
egg
every
day
of
the
week
you
sell
the
eggs
six
for
half
a
crown
keep
of
hen
costs
nothing
profit
at
least
a
couple
of
bob
on
every
dozen
eggs
what
do
you
think
of
that
i
think
i
like
to
overhaul
the
figures
in
case
of
error
error
shouted
ukridge
pounding
the
table
till
it
groaned
error
not
a
bit
of
it
ca
you
follow
a
simple
calculation
like
that
oh
i
forgot
to
say
that
you
get
and
here
is
the
nub
of
the
thing
you
get
your
first
hen
on
tick
anybody
will
be
glad
to
let
you
have
the
hen
on
tick
well
then
you
let
this
hen
this
first
original
hen
this
you
let
it
set
and
hatch
chickens
now
follow
me
closely
suppose
you
have
a
dozen
hens
very
well
then
when
each
of
the
dozen
has
a
dozen
chickens
you
send
the
old
hens
back
to
the
chappies
you
borrowed
them
from
with
thanks
for
kind
loan
and
there
you
are
starting
business
with
a
hundred
and
free
chickens
to
your
name
and
after
a
bit
when
the
chickens
grow
up
and
begin
to
lay
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
sit
back
in
your
chair
and
endorse
the
big
cheques
is
that
so
millie
yes
dear
we
fixed
it
all
up
do
you
know
combe
regis
in
dorsetshire
on
the
borders
of
devon
bathing
splendid
scenery
just
the
place
for
a
chicken
farm
a
friend
of
millie
girl
she
knew
at
school
has
lent
us
a
topping
old
house
with
large
grounds
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
get
in
the
fowls
i
ordered
the
first
lot
we
shall
find
them
waiting
for
us
when
we
arrive
well
i
said
i
sure
i
wish
you
luck
mind

let
me
know
how
you
get
on
let
you

roared
ukridge
why

dear
old
horse

coming
with
us
am
i
i
said
blankly
certainly
you
are
we
shall
take
no
refusal
will
we
millie
no
dear
of
course
not
no
refusal
of
any
sort
pack
up
and
meet
us
at
waterloo
it
awfully
good
of
you
not
a
bit
of
it
not
a
bit
of
it
this
is
pure
business
i
was
saying
to
millie
as
we
came
along
that
you
were
the
very
man
for
us
a
man
with
your
flow
of
ideas
will
be
invaluable
on
a
chicken
farm
absolutely
invaluable
you
see
proceeded
ukridge
i
one
of
those
practical
fellows
the
type
i
go
straight
ahead
following
my
nose
what
you
want
in
a
business
of
this
sort
is
a
touch
of
the
dreamer
to
help
out
the
practical
mind
we
look
to
you
for
suggestions
laddie
flashes
of
inspiration
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
you
take
your
share
of
the
profits
that
understood
yes
yes
i
must
insist
strict
business
between
friends
now
taking
it
that
at
a
conservative
estimate
the
net
profits
for
the
first
fiscal
year
amount
to
five
thousand
no
better
be
on
the
safe
side
say
four
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
but
we
arrange
all
that
end
of
it
when
we
get
down
there
millie
will
look
after
that
she
the
secretary
of
the
concern
she
been
writing
letters
to
people
asking
for
hens
so
you
see
it
a
thoroughly
organised
business
how
many
did
you
write
last
week
old
girl
ten
dear
ukridge
turned
triumphantly
to
me
you
hear
ten
ten
letters
asking
for
hens
that
the
way
to
succeed
push
and
enterprise
six
of
them
have
answered
stanley
dear
and
the
rest
refused
immaterial
said
ukridge
with
a
grand
gesture
that
does
matter
the
point
is
that
the
letters
were
written
it
shows
we
are
solid
and
practical
well
now
can
you
get
your
things
ready
by
garny
old
horse
strange
how
one
reaches
an
moment
in
one
life
without
recognising
it
if
i
had
refused
that
invitation
i
would
not
have
at
any
rate
i
would
have
missed
a
remarkable
experience
it
is
not
given
to
everyone
to
see
stanley
featherstonehaugh
ukridge
manage
a
chicken
farm
i
was
thinking
of
going
somewhere
where
i
could
get
some
golf
i
said
undecidedly
combe
regis
is
just
the
place
for
you
then
perfect
of
golf
full
of
the
finest
players
ca
throw
a
brick
without
hitting
an
amateur
champion
grand
links
at
the
top
of
the
hill
not
half
a
mile
from
the
farm
bring
your
clubs
you
be
able
to
play
in
the
afternoons
get
through
serious
work
by
lunch
time
you
know
i
said
i
am
absolutely
inexperienced
as
regards
fowls
i
just
know
enough
to
help
myself
to
bread
sauce
when
i
see
one
but
no
more
excellent
you
just
the
man
you
will
bring
to
the
work
a
mind
unclouded
by
theories
you
will
act
solely
by
the
light
of
your
intelligence
and
you
got
lots
of
that
that
novel
of
yours
showed
the
most
extraordinary
intelligence
at
least
as
far
as
that
blighter
at
the
bookstall
would
let
me
read
i
would
have
a
professional
chicken
farmer
about
the
place
if
he
paid
to
come
if
he
applied
to
me
i
should
simply
send
him
away
natural
intelligence
is
what
we
want
then
we
can
rely
on
you
very
well
i
said
slowly
it
very
kind
of
you
to
ask
me
business
laddie
pure
business
very
well
then
we
shall
catch
the
at
waterloo
do
miss
it
look
out
for
me
on
the
platform
if
i
see
you
first
i
shout
chapter
iii
waterloo
station
some
and
a
girl
with
brown
hair
the
austerity
of
waterloo
station
was
lightened
on
the
following
morning
at
ten
minutes
to
eleven
when
i
arrived
to
catch
the
train
to
combe
regis
by
several
gleams
of
sunshine
and
a
great
deal
of
bustle
and
activity
on
the
various
platforms
a
porter
took
my
suitcase
and
and
arranged
an
assignation
on
number
platform
i
bought
my
ticket
and
made
my
way
to
the
bookstall
where
in
the
interests
of
trade
i
inquired
in
a
loud
and
penetrating
voice
if
they
had
got
jeremy
garnet
manoeuvres
of
arthur
being
informed
that
they
had
not
i
clicked
my
tongue
reproachfully
advised
them
to
order
in
a
supply
as
the
demand
was
likely
to
be
large
and
spent
a
couple
of
shillings
on
a
magazine
and
some
weekly
papers
then
with
ten
minutes
to
spare
i
went
off
in
search
of
ukridge
i
found
him
on
platform
six
the
was
already
alongside
and
presently
i
observed
my
porter
cleaving
a
path
towards
me
with
the
and
here
you
are
shouted
ukridge
vigorously
good
for
you
thought
you
were
going
to
miss
it
i
shook
hands
with
the
smiling
ukridge
i
got
a
carriage
and
collared
two
corner
seats
millie
goes
down
in
another
she
does
like
the
smell
of
smoke
when
she
travelling
hope
we
get
the
carriage
to
ourselves
devil
of
a
lot
of
people
here
this
morning
still
the
more
people
there
are
in
the
world
the
more
eggs
we
shall
sell
i
can
see
with
half
an
eye
that
all
these
blighters
are
confirmed
get
in
sonnie
i
just
see
the
missis
into
her
carriage
and
come
back
to
you
i
entered
the
compartment
and
stood
at
the
door
looking
out
in
the
faint
hope
of
thwarting
an
invasion
of
then
i
withdrew
my
head
suddenly
and
sat
down
an
elderly
gentleman
accompanied
by
a
pretty
girl
was
coming
towards
me
it
was
not
this
type
of
fellow
traveller
whom
i
had
hoped
to
keep
out
i
had
noticed
the
girl
at
the
booking
office
she
had
waited
by
the
side
of
the
queue
while
the
elderly
gentleman
struggled
gamely
for
the
tickets
and
i
had
had
plenty
of
opportunity
of
observing
her
appearance
i
had
debated
with
myself
whether
her
hair
should
rightly
be
described
as
brown
or
golden
i
had
finally
decided
on
brown
once
only
had
i
met
her
eyes
and
then
only
for
an
instant
they
might
be
blue
they
might
be
grey
i
could
not
be
certain
life
is
full
of
these
problems
this
seems
to
be
tolerably
empty
my
dear
phyllis
said
the
elderly
gentleman
coming
to
the
door
of
the
compartment
and
looking
in
you
sure
you
do
object
to
a
oh
no
father
not
a
bit
then
i
think
said
the
elderly
gentleman
getting
in
the
inflection
of
his
voice
suggested
the
irishman
it
was
not
a
brogue
there
were
no
strange
words
but
the
general
effect
was
irish
that
good
he
said
settling
himself
and
pulling
out
a
cigar
case
the
bustle
of
the
platform
had
increased
momentarily
until
now
when
from
the
snorting
of
the
engine
it
seemed
likely
that
the
train
might
start
at
any
minute
the
crowd
excitement
was
extreme
shrill
cries
echoed
down
the
platform
lost
sheep
singly
and
in
companies
rushed
to
and
fro
peering
eagerly
into
carriages
in
search
of
seats
piercing
voices
ordered
unknown
tommies
and
ernies
to
keep
by
aunty
now
just
as
ukridge
returned
that
qui
of
the
railway
crowd
the
dreaded
get
in
anywhere
began
to
be
heard
and
the
next
moment
an
avalanche
of
warm
humanity
poured
into
the
carriage
the
newcomers
consisted
of
a
lady
addressed
as
aunty
very
stout
and
clad
in
a
grey
alpaca
dress
a
youth
called
albert
not
it
was
to
appear
a
sunny
child
a
niece
of
some
twenty
years
stolid
and
seemingly
without
interest
in
life
and
one
or
two
other
and
retainers
ukridge
slipped
into
his
corner
adroitly
foiling
albert
who
had
made
a
dive
in
that
direction
albert
regarded
him
fixedly
and
reproachfully
for
a
space
then
sank
into
the
seat
beside
me
and
began
to
chew
something
that
smelt
of
aniseed
aunty
meanwhile
was
distributing
her
substantial
weight
evenly
between
the
feet
of
the
irish
gentleman
and
those
of
his
daughter
as
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
converse
with
a
lady
friend
in
a
straw
hat
and
hair
curlers
accompanied
by
three
dirty
and
frivolous
boys
it
was
she
stated
lucky
that
she
had
caught
the
train
i
could
not
agree
with
her
the
girl
with
the
brown
hair
and
the
eyes
that
were
neither
blue
or
grey
was
bearing
the
infliction
i
noticed
with
angelic
calm
she
even
smiled
this
was
when
the
train
suddenly
moved
off
with
a
jerk
and
aunty
staggering
back
sat
down
on
the
bag
of
food
which
albert
had
placed
on
the
seat
beside
him
clumsy
observed
albert
tersely
you
must
speak
to
aunty
so
wodyer
want
to
sit
on
my
bag
for
then
said
albert
disagreeably
they
argued
the
point
argument
in
no
wise
interfered
with
power
of
mastication
the
odour
of
aniseed
became
more
and
more
painful
ukridge
had
lighted
a
cigar
and
i
understood
why
ukridge
preferred
to
travel
in
another
compartment
for
in
his
hand
he
bore
the
brand
which
none
but
he
might
smoke
i
looked
across
the
carriage
stealthily
to
see
how
the
girl
was
enduring
this
combination
of
evils
and
noticed
that
she
had
begun
to
read
and
as
she
put
the
book
down
to
look
out
of
the
window
i
saw
with
a
thrill
that
trickled
like
warm
water
down
my
spine
that
her
book
was
the
manoeuvres
of
arthur
i
gasped
that
a
girl
should
look
as
pretty
as
that
and
at
the
same
time
have
the
rare
intelligence
to
read
me
well
it
seemed
an
almost
superhuman
combination
of
the
excellencies
and
more
devoutly
than
ever
i
cursed
in
my
heart
these
intrusive
outsiders
who
had
charged
in
at
the
last
moment
and
destroyed
for
ever
my
chance
of
making
this
wonderful
girl
acquaintance
but
for
them
we
might
have
become
intimate
in
the
first
half
hour
as
it
was
what
were
we
ships
that
pass
in
the
night
she
would
get
out
at
some
beastly
wayside
station
and
vanish
from
my
life
without
my
ever
having
even
spoken
to
her
aunty
meanwhile
having
retired
badly
worsted
from
her
encounter
with
albert
who
showed
a
skill
in
logomachy
that
marked
him
out
as
a
future
labour
member
was
consoling
herself
with
meat
sandwiches
the
niece
was
demolishing
sausage
rolls
the
atmosphere
of
the
carriage
was
charged
with
a
blend
of
odours
topping
all
ukridge
cigar
now
in
full
blast
the
train
raced
on
towards
the
sea
it
was
a
warm
day
and
a
torpid
peace
began
to
settle
down
upon
the
carriage
ukridge
had
thrown
away
the
stump
of
his
cigar
and
was
now
leaning
back
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
shut
aunty
still
clutching
a
section
of
a
beef
sandwich
was
breathing
heavily
and
swaying
from
side
to
side
albert
and
the
niece
were
dozing
albert
jaws
working
automatically
even
in
sleep
what
your
book
my
dear
asked
the
irishman
manoeuvres
of
arthur
father
by
jeremy
garnet
i
would
not
have
believed
without
the
evidence
of
my
ears
that
my
name
could
possibly
have
sounded
so
musical
molly
mceachern
gave
it
to
me
when
i
left
the
abbey
she
keeps
a
shelf
of
books
for
her
guests
when
they
are
going
away
books
that
she
considers
rubbish
and
does
want
you
know
i
hated
miss
mceachern
without
further
evidence
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
like
it
said
the
girl
decidedly
the
carriage
swam
before
my
eyes
i
think
it
is
very
clever
what
did
it
matter
after
that
that
the
ass
in
charge
of
the
waterloo
bookstall
had
never
heard
of
the
manoeuvres
of
arthur
and
that
my
publishers
whenever
i
slunk
in
to
ask
how
it
was
selling
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
grave
paternal
pity
and
said
that
it
had
not
really
begun
to
move
anybody
can
write
one
of
those
rotten
popular
novels
which
appeal
to
the
unthinking
public
but
it
takes
a
man
of
intellect
and
refinement
and
taste
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
to
turn
out
something
that
will
be
approved
of
by
a
girl
like
this
i
wonder
who
jeremy
garnet
is
she
said
i
never
heard
of
him
before
i
imagine
him
rather
an
old
young
man
probably
with
an
eyeglass
and
conceited
and
i
should
think
he
did
know
many
girls
at
least
if
he
thinks
pamela
an
ordinary
sort
of
girl
she
a
said
phyllis
emphatically
this
was
a
blow
to
me
i
had
always
looked
on
pamela
as
a
character
and
a
very
attractive
kittenish
little
thing
at
that
that
scene
between
her
and
the
curate
in
the
conservatory
and
when
she
talks
to
arthur
at
the
meet
of
the
blankshires
i
was
sorry
she
did
not
like
pamela
somehow
it
lowered
pamela
in
my
estimation
but
i
like
arthur
said
the
girl
this
was
better
a
good
chap
arthur
a
very
complete
and
thoughtful
study
of
myself
if
she
liked
arthur
why
then
it
followed
but
what
was
the
use
i
should
never
get
a
chance
of
speaking
to
her
we
were
divided
by
a
great
gulf
of
aunties
and
alberts
and
meat
sandwiches
the
train
was
beginning
to
slow
down
signs
of
returning
animation
began
to
be
noticeable
among
the
sleepers
aunty
eyes
opened
stared
vacantly
round
closed
and
reopened
the
niece
woke
and
started
instantly
to
attack
a
sausage
roll
albert
and
ukridge
slumbered
on
a
whistle
from
the
engine
and
the
train
drew
up
at
a
station
looking
out
i
saw
that
it
was
yeovil
there
was
a
general
exodus
aunty
became
instantly
a
thing
of
dash
and
electricity
collected
parcels
shook
albert
replied
to
his
thrusts
with
repartee
and
finally
heading
a
stampede
out
of
the
door
the
irishman
and
his
daughter
also
rose
and
got
out
i
watched
them
leave
stoically
it
would
have
been
too
much
to
expect
that
they
should
be
going
any
further
where
are
we
said
ukridge
sleepily
yeovil
not
far
now
i
tell
you
what
it
is
old
horse
i
could
do
with
a
drink
with
that
remark
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
returned
to
his
slumbers
and
as
he
did
so
my
eye
roving
discontentedly
over
the
carriage
was
caught
by
something
lying
in
the
far
corner
it
was
the
manoeuvres
of
arthur
the
girl
had
left
it
behind
i
suppose
what
follows
shows
the
vanity
that
obsesses
young
authors
it
did
not
even
present
itself
to
me
as
a
tenable
theory
that
the
book
might
have
been
left
behind
on
purpose
as
being
of
no
further
use
to
the
owner
it
only
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
did
not
act
swiftly
the
poor
girl
would
suffer
a
loss
beside
which
the
loss
of
a
purse
or
were
trivial
five
seconds
later
i
was
on
the
platform
excuse
me
i
said
i
think
oh
thank
you
so
much
said
the
girl
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
carriage
and
lit
my
pipe
in
a
glow
of
emotion
they
are
blue
i
said
to
my
immortal
soul
a
wonderful
deep
soft
heavenly
blue
like
the
sea

noonday
chapter
iv
the
arrival
from
axminster
to
combe
regis
the
line
runs
through
country
as
attractive
as
any
that
can
be
found
in
the
island
and
the
train
as
if
in
appreciation
of
this
fact
does
not
hurry
over
the
journey
it
was
late
afternoon
by
the
time
we
reached
our
destination
the
arrangements
for
the
carrying
of
luggage
at
combe
regis
border
on
the
primitive
boxes
are
left
on
the
platform
and
later
when
he
thinks
of
it
a
carrier
looks
in
and
conveys
them
into
the
valley
and
up
the
hill
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
address
written
on
the
labels
the
owner
walks
combe
regis
is
not
a
place
for
the
halt
and
maimed
ukridge
led
us
in
the
direction
of
the
farm
which
lay
across
the
valley
looking
through
woods
to
the
sea
the
place
was
visible
from
the
station
from
which
indeed
standing
as
it
did
on
the
top
of
a
hill
the
view
was
extensive
up
the
slope
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
we
left
the
road
and
made
our
way
across
a
spongy
field
ukridge
explaining
that
this
was
a
short
cut
we
climbed
through
a
hedge
crossed
a
stream
and
another
field
and
after
negotiating
a
difficult
bank
topped
with
barbed
wire
found
ourselves
in
a
garden
ukridge
mopped
his
forehead
and
restored
his
to
their
original
position
from
which
the
passage
of
the
barbed
wire
had
dislodged
them
this
is
the
place
he
said
we
come
in
by
the
back
way
saves
time
tired
millie
a
little
dear
i
should
like
some
tea
same
here
i
agreed
that
be
all
right
said
ukridge
a
most
competent
man
of
the
name
of
beale
and
his
wife
are
in
charge
at
present
i
wrote
to
them
telling
them
that
we
were
coming
they
will
be
ready
for
us
that
the
way
to
do
things
garny
old
horse
quiet
efficiency
perfect
organisation
we
were
at
the
front
door
by
this
time
ukridge
rang
the
bell
the
noise
echoed
through
the
house
but
there
was
no
answering
footsteps
he
rang
again
there
is
no
mistaking
the
note
of
a
bell
in
an
empty
house
it
was
plain
that
the
competent
man
and
his
wife
were
out
now
what
i
said
ukridge
looked
at
her
husband
with
calm
confidence
this
said
ukridge
leaning
against
the
door
and
endeavouring
to
button
his
collar
at
the
back
reminds
me
of
an
afternoon
in
the
argentine
two
other
cheery
sportsmen
and
myself
tried
for
of
an
hour
to
get
into
an
empty
house
where
there
looked
as
if
there
might
be
something
to
drink
and
we
just
got
the
door
open
when
the
owner
turned
up
from
behind
a
tree
with
a
it
was
a
little
difficult
to
explain
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
never
did
what
you
might
call
really
thresh
the
matter
out
thoroughly
in
all
its
aspects
and
you
be
surprised
what
a
devil
of
a
time
it
takes
to
pick
out
of
a
fellow
there
was
a
dog
too
he
broke
off
musing
dreamily
on
the
happy
past
and
at
this
moment
history
partially
repeated
itself
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
came
a
dissatisfied
whine
followed
by
a
short
bark
hullo
said
ukridge
beale
has
a
dog
he
frowned
annoyed
what
right
he
added
in
an
aggrieved
tone
has
a
beastly
mongrel
belonging
to
a
man
i
employ
to
keep
me
out
of
my
own
house
it
a
little
hard
here
am
i
slaving
day
and
night
to
support
beale
and
when
i
try
to
get
into
my
own
house
his
infernal
dog
barks
at
me
upon
my
sam
it
hard
he
brooded
for
a
moment
on
the
injustice
of
things
here
let
me
get
to
the
keyhole
i
reason
with
the
brute
he
put
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
and
roared
goo
dog
through
it
instantly
the
door
shook
as
some
heavy
object
hurled
itself
against
it
the
barking
rang
through
the
house
come
round
to
the
back
said
ukridge
giving
up
the
idea
of
conciliation
we
get
in
through
the
kitchen
window
the
kitchen
window
proved
to
be
insecurely
latched
ukridge
threw
it
open
and
we
climbed
in
the
dog
hearing
the
noise
raced
back
along
the
passage
and
flung
himself
at
the
door
scratching
at
the
panels
ukridge
listened
with
growing
indignation
millie
you
know
how
to
light
a
fire
garnet
and
i
will
be
collecting
cups
and
things
when
that
scoundrel
beale
arrives
i
shall
tear
him
limb
from
limb
deserting
us
like
this
the
man
must
be
a
thorough
fraud
he
told
me
he
was
an
old
soldier
if
that
the
sort
of
discipline
they
used
to
keep
in
his
regiment
thank
god
we
got
a
navy
damn
i
broken
a
plate
how
the
fire
getting
on
millie
i
chop
beale
into
little
bits
what
that
you
got
there
garny
old
horse
tea
good
where
the
bread
there
goes
another
plate
where
beale
too
by
jove
that
woman
wants
killing
as
much
as
her
blackguard
of
a
husband
whoever
heard
of
a
cook
deliberately
leaving
her
post
on
the
day
when
her
master
and
mistress
were
expected
back
the
abandoned
woman
look
here
i
give
that
dog
three
minutes
and
if
it
does
stop
scratching
that
door
by
then
i
take
a
rolling
pin
and
go
out
and
have
a
talk
with
it
it
a
little
hard
my
own
house
and
the
first
thing
i
find
when
i
arrive
is
somebody
else
beastly
dog
scratching
holes
in
the
doors
and
ruining
the
expensive
paint
stop
it
you
brute
the
dog
reply
was
to
continue
his
operations
with
immense
vigour
ukridge
eyes
gleamed
behind
their
glasses
give
me
a
good
large
jug
laddie
he
said
with
ominous
calm
he
took
the
largest
of
the
jugs
from
the
dresser
and
strode
with
it
into
the
scullery
whence
came
a
sound
of
running
water
he
returned
carrying
the
jug
with
both
hands
his
mien
that
of
a
general
who
sees
his
way
to
a
masterstroke
of
strategy
garny
old
horse
he
said
freeze
onto
the
handle
of
the
door
and
when
i
give
the
word
fling
wide
the
gates
then
watch
that
animal
get
the
surprise
of
a
lifetime
i
attached
myself
to
the
handle
as
directed
ukridge
gave
the
word
we
had
a
momentary
vision
of
an
excited
dog
of
the
mongrel
class
framed
in
the
open
doorway
all
eyes
and
teeth
then
the
passage
was
occupied
by
a
spreading
pool
and
indignant
barks
from
the
distance
told
that
the
enemy
was
thinking
the
thing
over
in
some
safe
retreat
settled
hash
said
ukridge
complacently
nothing
like
resource
garny
my
boy
some
men
would
have
gone
on
letting
a
good
door
be
ruined
and
spoiled
the
dog
for
a
of
water
i
said
at
this
moment
ukridge
announced
that
the
kettle
was
boiling
over
a
cup
of
tea
ukridge
became
the
man
of
business
i
wonder
when
those
fowls
are
going
to
arrive
they
should
have
been
here
it
a
little
hard
here
am
i
all
eagerness
and
anxiety
waiting
to
start
an
chicken
farm
and
no
fowls
i
ca
run
a
chicken
farm
without
fowls
if
they
do
come
i
shall
get
after
those
people
with
a
hatchet
there
must
be
no
slackness
they
must
bustle
about
after
tea
i
show
you
the
garden
and
we
choose
a
place
for
a
we
must
buckle
to
serious
work
will
begin
immediately
after
breakfast
suppose
i
said
the
fowls
arrive
before
we
ready
for
them
why
then
they
must
wait
but
you
ca
keep
fowls
cooped
up
indefinitely
in
a
crate
oh
that
be
all
right
there
a
basement
to
this
house
we
let
run
about
there
till
we
ready
for
them
there
always
a
way
of
doing
things
if
you
look
for
it
organisation
my
boy
that
the
watchword
quiet
efficiency
i
hope
you
are
going
to
let
the
hens
hatch
some
of
the
eggs
dear
said
ukridge
i
should
love
to
have
some
little
chickens
of
course
by
all
means
my
idea
said
ukridge
was
this
these
people
will
send
us
fifty
fowls
of
sorts
that
means
call
it
eggs
a
day
let
well
i
hanged
there
that
dog
again
where
the
jug
but
this
time
an
unforeseen
interruption
prevented
the
manoeuvre
being
the
success
it
had
been
before
i
had
turned
the
handle
and
was
about
to
pull
the
door
open
while
ukridge
looking
like
some
modern
and
dilapidated
version
of
the
stood
beside
me
with
his
jug
poised
when
a
voice
spoke
from
the
window
stand
still
said
the
voice
or
i
corpse
you
i
dropped
the
handle
ukridge
dropped
the
jug
ukridge
dropped
her
at
the
window
with
a
gun
in
his
hands
stood
a
short
square
man
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
which
rested
on
the
sill
was
pointing
in
a
straight
line
at
the
third
button
of
my
waistcoat
ukridge
emitted
a
roar
like
that
of
a
hungry
lion
beale
you
scoundrelly
unprincipled
demon
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
with
that
gun
why
were
you
out
what
have
you
been
doing
why
did
you
shout
like
that
look
what
you
made
me
do
he
pointed
to
the
floor
the
very
old
pair
of
tennis
shoes
which
he
wore
were
by
this
time
generously
soaked
with
the
spilled
water
lor
ukridge
sir
is
that
you
said
the
man
calmly
i
thought
you
was
burglars
a
short
bark
from
the
other
side
of
the
kitchen
door
followed
by
a
renewal
of
the
scratching
drew
beale
attention
to
his
faithful
hound
that
bob
he
said
i
do
know
what
you
call
the
brute
said
ukridge
come
in
and
tie
him
up
and
mind
what
you
doing
with
that
gun
after
you
finished
with
the
dog
i
should
like
a
brief
chat
with
you
laddie
if
you
can
spare
the
time
and
have
no
other
engagements
beale
having
carefully
deposited
the
gun
against
the
wall
and
dropped
a
pair
of
very
limp
rabbits
on
the
floor
proceeded
to
climb
in
through
the
window
this
operation
concluded
he
stood
to
one
side
while
the
besieged
garrison
passed
out
by
the
same
route
you
will
find
me
in
the
garden
said
ukridge
coldly
i
one
or
two
little
things
to
say
to
you
beale
grinned
affably
he
seemed
to
be
a
man
of
equable
temperament
the
cool
air
of
the
garden
was
grateful
after
the
warmth
of
the
kitchen
it
was
a
pretty
garden
or
would
have
been
if
it
had
not
been
so
neglected
i
seemed
to
see
myself
sitting
in
a
on
the
lawn
smoking
and
looking
through
the
trees
at
the
harbour
below
it
was
a
spot
i
felt
in
which
it
would
be
an
easy
and
a
pleasant
task
to
shape
the
plot
of
my
novel
i
was
glad
i
had
come
about
now
outside
my
lodgings
in
town
a
particularly
foul
would
be
settling
down
to
work
oh
there
you
are
beale
said
ukridge
as
the
servitor
appeared
now
then
what
have
you
to
say
the
hired
man
looked
thoughtful
for
a
moment
then
said
that
it
was
a
fine
evening
fine
evening
shouted
ukridge
what
on
earth
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
i
want
to
know
why
you
and
beale
were
out
when
we
arrived
the
missus
went
to
axminster
ukridge
sir
she
had
no
right
to
go
to
axminster
it
is
part
of
her
duties
to
go
gadding
about
to
axminster
i
do
pay
her
enormous
sums
to
go
to
axminster
you
knew
i
was
coming
this
evening
no
sir
what
no
sir
beale
said
ukridge
with
studied
calm
the
strong
man
repressing
himself
one
of
us
two
is
a
fool
yes
sir
let
us
sift
this
matter
to
the
bottom
you
got
my
letter
no
sir
my
letter
saying
that
i
should
arrive
you
did
get
it
no
sir
now
look
here
beale
this
is
absurd
i
am
certain
that
that
letter
was
posted
i
remember
placing
it
in
my
pocket
for
that
purpose
it
is
not
there
now
see
these
are
all
the
contents
of
my
well
i
hanged
he
stood
looking
at
the
envelope
which
he
had
produced
from
his
a
soft
smile
played
over
beale
wooden
face
he
coughed
beale
said
ukridge
you
er
there
seems
to
have
been
a
mistake
yes
sir
you
are
not
so
much
to
blame
as
i
thought
no
sir
there
was
a
silence
anyhow
said
ukridge
in
inspired
tones
i
go
and
slay
that
infernal
dog
i
teach
him
to
tear
my
door
to
pieces
where
your
gun
beale
but
better
counsels
prevailed
and
the
proceedings
closed
with
a
cold
but
pleasant
little
dinner
at
which
the
spared
mongrel
came
out
unexpectedly
strong
with
ingenious
and
diverting
tricks
chapter
v
buckling
to
sunshine
streaming
into
my
bedroom
through
the
open
window
woke
me
next
day
as
distant
clocks
were
striking
eight
it
was
a
lovely
morning
cool
and
fresh
the
grass
of
the
lawn
wet
with
dew
sparkled
in
the
sun
a
thrush
who
knew
all
about
early
birds
and
their
perquisites
was
filling
in
the
time
before
the
arrival
of
the
worm
with
a
song
or
two
as
he
sat
in
the
bushes
in
the
ivy
a
colony
of
sparrows
were
opening
the
day
with
brisk
scuffling
on
the
gravel
in
front
of
the
house
lay
the
mongrel
bob
blinking
lazily
the
gleam
of
the
sea
through
the
trees
turned
my
thoughts
to
bathing
i
dressed
quickly
and
went
out
bob
rose
to
meet
me
waving
an
absurdly
long
tail
the
hatchet
was
definitely
buried
now
that
little
matter
of
the
jug
of
water
was
forgotten
a
walk
of
five
minutes
down
the
hill
brought
me
accompanied
by
bob
to
the
sleepy
little
town
i
passed
through
the
narrow
street
and
turned
on
to
the
beach
walking
in
the
direction
of
the
combination
of
pier
and
which
loomed
up
through
the
faint
mist
the
tide
was
high
and
leaving
my
clothes
to
the
care
of
bob
who
treated
them
as
a
handy
bed
i
dived
into
twelve
feet
of
clear
cold
water
as
i
swam
i
compared
it
with
the
morning
tub
of
london
and
felt
that
i
had
done
well
to
come
with
ukridge
to
this
pleasant
spot
not
that
i
could
rely
on
unbroken
calm
during
the
whole
of
my
visit
i
knew
nothing
of
but
i
was
certain
that
ukridge
knew
less
there
would
be
some
strenuous
moments
before
that
farm
became
a
profitable
commercial
speculation
at
the
thought
of
ukridge
toiling
on
a
hot
afternoon
to
manage
an
undisciplined
mob
of
fowls
i
laughed
and
swallowed
a
generous
mouthful
of
salt
water
and
turning
swam
back
to
bob
and
my
clothes
on
my
return
i
found
ukridge
in
his
shirt
sleeves
and
minus
a
collar
assailing
a
large
ham
ukridge
looking
younger
and
more
than
ever
in
brown
holland
smiled
at
me
over
the
hullo
old
horse
bellowed
ukridge
where
have
you
been
bathing
hope
it
made
you
feel
fit
for
work
because
we
got
to
buckle
to
this
morning
the
fowls
have
arrived
garnet
said
ukridge
opening
her
eyes
till
she
looked
like
an
astonished
kitten
a
lot
of
them
they
making
such
a
noise
to
support
her
statement
there
floated
in
through
the
window
a
cackling
which
for
volume
and
variety
beat
anything
i
had
ever
heard
judging
from
the
noise
it
seemed
as
if
england
had
been
drained
of
fowls
and
the
entire
tribe
of
them
dumped
into
the
yard
of
ukridge
farm
there
seems
to
have
been
no
stint
i
said
quite
a
goodish
few
are
there
said
ukridge
complacently
but
that
what
we
want
no
good
starting
on
a
small
scale
the
more
you
have
the
bigger
the
profits
what
sorts
have
you
got
mostly
i
asked
showing
a
professional
interest
oh
all
sorts
my
theory
laddie
is
this
it
does
matter
a
bit
what
kind
we
get
because
they
all
lay
and
if
we
sell
settings
of
eggs
which
we
will
we
merely
say
it
an
unfortunate
accident
if
they
turn
out
mixed
when
hatched
bless
you
people
do
mind
what
breed
a
fowl
is
so
long
as
it
got
two
legs
and
a
beak
these
dealer
chaps
were
so
infernally
particular
dorkings
they
said
right
i
said
on
your
dorkings
perhaps
you
will
require
a
few
minorcas
well
i
said
the
minorcas
they
were
going
on
they
have
gone
on
for
hours
but
i
stopped
here
my
dear
old
college
chum
i
said
kindly
but
firmly
to
the
manager
johnny
decent
old
buck
with
the
manners
of
a
marquess
here
i
said
is
short
and
we
neither
of
us
as
young
as
we
used
to
be
do
let
us
waste
the
golden
hours
playing
guessing
games
i
want
fowls
you
sell
fowls
so
give
me
some
of
all
sorts
mix
up
laddie
i
said
up
and
he
has
by
jove
you
go
into
the
yard
and
look
at
beale
has
turned
them
out
of
their
crates
there
must
be
one
of
every
breed
ever
invented
where
are
you
going
to
put
them
that
spot
we
chose
by
the
paddock
that
the
place
plenty
of
mud
for
them
to
scratch
about
in
and
they
can
go
into
the
field
when
they
feel
like
it
and
pick
up
worms
or
whatever
they
feed
on
we
must
rig
them
up
some
sort
of
shanty
i
suppose
this
morning
we
go
and
tell
to
send
up
some
and
stuff
from
the
town
then
we
shall
want
we
shall
have
to
make
those
of
course
so
we
shall
millie
did
i
tell
you
that
old
garnet
was
the
man
to
think
of
things
i
forgot
the
coops
we
ca
buy
some
i
suppose
on
tick
of
course
cheaper
to
make
them
suppose
we
get
a
lot
of
boxes
sugar
boxes
are
as
good
as
any
it
wo
take
long
to
knock
up
a
few
coops
ukridge
thumped
the
table
with
enthusiasm
upsetting
his
cup
garny
old
horse
you
a
marvel
you
think
of
everything
buckle
to
right
away
and
get
the
whole
place
fixed
up
the
same
as
mother
makes
it
what
an
infernal
noise
those
birds
are
making
i
suppose
they
do
feel
at
home
in
the
yard
wait
till
they
see
the
compact
residential
mansions
we
going
to
put
up
for
them
finished
breakfast
then
let
go
out
come
along
millie
the
beale
discovered
leaning
in
an
attitude
of
thought
on
the
yard
gate
and
observing
the
feathered
mob
below
with
much
interest
was
roused
from
his
reflections
and
despatched
to
the
town
for
the
wire
and
sugar
boxes
ukridge
taking
his
place
at
the
gate
gazed
at
the
fowls
with
the
affectionate
air
of
a
proprietor
well
they
have
certainly
taken
you
at
your
word
i
said
as
far
as
variety
is
concerned
the
man
with
the
manners
of
a
marquess
seemed
to
have
been
at
great
pains
to
send
a
really
representative
selection
of
fowls
there
were
blue
ones
black
ones
white
grey
yellow
brown
big
little
dorkings
minorcas
cochin
chinas
bantams
wyandottes
it
was
an
imposing
spectacle
the
hired
man
returned
towards
the
end
of
the
morning
preceded
by
a
cart
containing
the
necessary
wire
and
boxes
and
ukridge
whose
enthusiasm
brooked
no
delay
started
immediately
the
task
of
fashioning
the
coops
while
i
assisted
by
beale
draped
the
about
the
chosen
spot
next
to
the
paddock
there
were
little
unpleasantnesses
once
a
roar
of
anguish
told
that
ukridge
hammer
had
found
the
wrong
billet
and
on
another
occasion
my
flannel
trousers
suffered
on
the
wire
but
the
work
proceeded
steadily
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
things
were
in
a
sufficiently
advanced
state
to
suggest
to
ukridge
the
advisability
of
a
halt
for
refreshments
that
the
way
to
do
it
he
said
beaming
through
misty
over
a
long
glass
that
is
the
stuff
to
administer
to
at
this
rate
we
shall
have
the
place
in
corking
condition
before
bedtime
quiet
efficiency
that
the
wheeze
what
do
you
think
of
those
for
coops
beale
the
hired
man
examined
them
woodenly
i
seen
worse
sir
he
continued
his
examination
but
not
many
he
added
beale
passion
for
the
truth
had
made
him
unpopular
in
three
regiments
they
are
so
bad
i
said
but
i
glad
i
not
a
fowl
so
you
ought
to
be
said
ukridge
considering
the
way
you
put
up
that
wire
you
have
them
strangling
themselves
in
spite
of
earnest
labour
the
housing
arrangements
of
the
fowls
were
still
in
an
incomplete
state
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
details
of
the
evening
work
are
preserved
in
a
letter
which
i
wrote
that
night
to
my
friend
lickford
have
you
ever
played
a
game
called
pigs
in
clover
we
have
just
finished
a
merry
bout
of
it
with
hens
instead
of
marbles
which
has
lasted
for
an
hour
and
a
half
we
are
all
dead
tired
except
the
hired
man
who
seems
to
be
made
of
he
has
just
gone
for
a
stroll
on
the
beach
wants
some
exercise
i
suppose
personally
i
feel
as
if
i
should
never
move
again
you
have
no
conception
of
the
difficulty
of
rounding
up
fowls
and
getting
them
safely
to
bed
having
no
proper
place
to
put
them
we
were
obliged
to
stow
some
of
them
in
the
cube
and
the
rest
in
the
basement
it
has
only
just
occurred
to
me
that
they
ought
to
have
had
perches
to
roost
on
it
did
strike
me
before
i
sha
mention
it
to
ukridge
or
that
indomitable
man
will
start
making
some
and
drag
me
into
it
too
after
all
a
hen
can
rough
it
for
one
night
and
if
i
did
a
stroke
more
work
i
should
collapse
my
idea
was
to
do
the
thing
on
the
slow
but
sure
principle
that
is
to
say
take
each
bird
singly
and
carry
it
to
bed
it
would
have
taken
some
time
but
there
would
have
been
no
confusion
but
you
can
imagine
that
that
sort
of
thing
would
not
appeal
to
stanley
featherstonehaugh
he
likes
his
manoeuvres
to
be
on
a
large
dashing
napoleonic
scale
he
said
the
yard
gate
and
let
the
blighters
come
out
into
the
open
then
sail
in
and
drive
them
in
mass
formation
through
the
back
door
into
the
basement
it
was
a
great
idea
but
there
was
one
fatal
flaw
in
it
it
did
allow
for
the
hens
scattering
we
opened
the
gate
and
out
they
all
came
like
an
audience
coming
out
of
a
theatre
then
we
closed
in
on
them
to
bring
off
the
big
drive
for
about
thirty
seconds
it
looked
as
if
we
might
do
it
then
bob
the
hired
man
dog
an
animal
who
likes
to
be
in
whatever
going
on
rushed
out
of
the
house
into
the
middle
of
them
barking
there
was
a
perfect
stampede
and
heaven
only
knows
where
some
of
those
fowls
are
now
there
was
one
in
particular
a
large
yellow
bird
which
i
should
imagine
is
nearing
london
by
this
time
the
last
i
saw
of
it
it
was
navigating
at
the
rate
of
knots
in
that
direction
with
bob
after
it
barking
his
hardest
the
fowl
was
showing
a
rare
turn
of
speed
and
gaining
rapidly
presently
bob
came
back
panting
having
evidently
given
the
thing
up
we
in
the
meantime
were
chasing
the
rest
of
the
birds
all
over
the
garden
the
affair
had
now
resolved
itself
into
the
course
of
action
i
had
suggested
originally
except
that
instead
of
collecting
them
quietly
and
at
our
leisure
we
had
to
run
miles
for
each
one
we
captured
after
a
time
we
introduced
some
sort
of
system
into
it
ukridge
stood
at
the
door
we
chased
the
hens
and
brought
them
in
then
as
we
put
each
through
into
the
basement
she
shut
the
door
on
it
we
also
arranged
ukridge
coops
in
a
row
and
when
we
caught
a
fowl
we
put
it
in
the
coop
and
stuck
a
board
in
front
of
it
by
these
strenuous
means
we
gathered
in
about
of
the
lot
the
rest
are
all
over
england
a
few
may
be
still
in
dorsetshire
but
i
should
not
like
to
bet
on
it
so
you
see
things
are
being
managed
on
the
chicken
farm
on
good
sound
ukridge
principles
it
is
only
the
beginning
i
look
with
confidence
for
further
interesting
events
i
believe
if
ukridge
kept
white
mice
he
would
manage
to
get
feverish
excitement
out
of
it
he
is
at
present
lying
on
the
sofa
smoking
one
of
his
infernal
brand
of
cigars
drinking
whisky
and
soda
and
complaining
with
some
bitterness
because
the
whisky
is
as
good
as
some
he
once
tasted
in
belfast
from
the
basement
i
can
hear
faintly
the
murmur
of
innumerable
fowls
chapter
vi
garnet
narrative
has
to
do
with
a
reunion
the
day
was
thursday
the
date
july
the
we
had
been
for
a
whole
week
and
things
were
beginning
to
settle
down
to
a
certain
extent
the
coops
were
finished
they
were
not
masterpieces
and
i
have
seen
chickens
pause
before
them
in
deep
thought
as
who
should
say
now
what
but
they
were
coops
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
we
induced
hens
to
become
tenants
the
hardest
work
had
been
the
fixing
of
the
this
was
the
department
of
the
hired
man
and
myself
ukridge
holding
himself
proudly
aloof
while
beale
and
i
worked
ourselves
to
a
fever
in
the
sun
the
senior
partner
of
the
firm
sat
on
a
in
the
shade
offering
not
unkindly
criticism
and
advice
and
from
time
to
time
abusing
his
creditors
who
were
numerous
for
we
had
hardly
been
in
residence
a
day
before
he
began
to
order
in
a
vast
supply
of
necessary
and
unnecessary
things
all
on
credit
some
he
got
from
the
village
others
from
neighbouring
towns
axminster
he
laid
heavily
under
contribution
he
even
went
as
far
afield
as
dorchester
he
had
a
persuasive
way
with
him
and
the
tradesmen
seemed
to
treat
him
like
a
favourite
son
the
things
began
to
pour
in
from
all
sides
groceries
whisky
a
piano
a
gramophone
pictures
also
cigars
in
great
profusion
he
was
not
one
of
those
men
who
want
but
little
here
below
as
regards
the
financial
side
of
these
transactions
his
method
was
simple
and
masterly
if
a
tradesman
suggested
that
a
small
cheque
on
account
would
not
be
taken
amiss
as
one
or
two
sordid
fellows
did
he
became
pathetic
confound
it
sir
he
would
say
with
tears
in
his
voice
laying
a
hand
on
the
man
shoulders
in
a
wounded
way
it
a
trifle
hard
when
a
gentleman
comes
to
settle
in
your
neighbourhood
that
you
should
dun
him
for
money
before
he
has
got
the
preliminary
expenses
about
the
house
off
his
back
this
sounded
well
and
suggested
the
disbursement
of
huge
sums
for
rent
the
fact
that
the
house
had
been
lent
him
rent
free
was
kept
with
some
care
in
the
background
having
weakened
the
man
with
pathos
he
would
strike
a
sterner
note
a
little
more
of
this
he
would
go
on
and
i
close
my
account
why
damme
in
all
my
experience
i
never
heard
anything
like
it
upon
which
the
man
would
apologise
and
go
away
forgiven
with
a
large
order
for
more
goods
by
these
statesmanlike
methods
he
had
certainly
made
the
place
very
comfortable
i
suppose
we
all
realised
that
the
things
would
have
to
be
paid
for
some
day
but
the
thought
did
not
worry
us
pay
bellowed
ukridge
on
the
only
occasion
when
i
ventured
to
bring
up
the
unpleasant
topic
of
course
we
shall
pay
why
not
i
do
like
to
see
this
spirit
in
you
old
horse
the
money
coming
in
yet
i
admit
but
we
must
give
it
time
soon
we
shall
be
turning
over
hundreds
a
week
hundreds
i
in
touch
with
all
the
big
places
whiteley
harrod
all
the
nibs
here
i
am
i
said
to
them
with
a
large
chicken
farm
with
all
the
modern
improvements
you
want
eggs
old
horses
i
said
i
supply
them
i
will
let
you
have
so
many
hundred
eggs
a
week
i
said
what
will
you
give
for
them
well
admit
their
terms
did
not
come
up
to
my
expectations
altogether
but
we
must
not
sneer
at
small
prices
at
first
when
we
get
a
connection
we
shall
be
able
to
name
our
terms
it
stands
to
reason
laddie
have
you
ever
seen
a
man
woman
or
child
who
was
eating
an
egg
or
just
going
to
eat
an
egg
or
just
coming
away
from
eating
an
egg
i
tell
you
the
good
old
egg
is
the
foundation
of
daily
life
stop
the
first
man
you
meet
in
the
street
and
ask
him
which
he
sooner
lose
his
egg
or
his
wife
and
see
what
he
says
we
on
to
a
good
thing
garny
my
boy
pass
the
whisky
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
the
firms
mentioned
supplied
us
with
a
quantity
of
goods
agreeing
to
receive
phantom
eggs
in
exchange
this
satisfied
ukridge
he
had
a
faith
in
the
laying
power
of
his
hens
which
would
have
flattered
them
if
they
could
have
known
it
it
might
also
have
stimulated
their
efforts
in
that
direction
which
up
to
date
were
feeble
it
was
now
as
i
have
said
thursday
the
of
july
a
glorious
sunny
morning
of
the
kind
which
providence
sends
occasionally
simply
in
order
to
allow
the
honest
smoker
to
take
his
pipe
under
ideal
conditions
these
are
the
pipes
to
which
a
man
looks
back
in
after
years
with
a
feeling
of
wistful
reverence
pipes
smoked
in
perfect
tranquillity
mind
and
body
alike
at
rest
it
is
over
pipes
like
these
that
we
dream
our
dreams
and
fashion
our
masterpieces
my
pipe
was
behaving
like
the
ideal
pipe
and
as
i
strolled
spaciously
about
the
lawn
my
novel
was
growing
nobly
i
had
neglected
my
literary
work
for
the
past
week
owing
to
the
insistent
claims
of
the
fowls
i
am
not
one
of
those
men
whose
minds
work
in
placid
independence
of
the
conditions
of
life
but
i
was
making
up
for
lost
time
now
with
each
blue
cloud
that
left
my
lips
and
hung
in
the
still
air
above
me
striking
scenes
and
freshets
of
sparkling
dialogue
rushed
through
my
brain
another
uninterrupted
half
hour
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
should
have
completed
the
framework
of
a
novel
which
would
have
placed
me
in
that
select
band
of
authors
who
have
no
christian
names
another
half
hour
and
posterity
would
have
known
me
as
garnet
but
it
was
not
to
be
stop
her
catch
her
garny
old
horse
i
had
wandered
into
the
paddock
at
the
moment
i
looked
up
coming
towards
me
at
her
best
pace
was
a
small
hen
i
recognised
her
immediately
it
was
the
disagreeable
bird
which
ukridge
on
the
strength
of
an
alleged
similarity
of
profile
to
his
wife
nearest
relative
had
christened
aunt
elizabeth
a
bolshevist
hen
always
at
the
bottom
of
any
disturbance
in
the
a
bird
which
ate
its
head
off
daily
at
our
expense
and
bit
the
hands
which
fed
it
by
resolutely
declining
to
lay
a
single
egg
behind
this
fowl
ran
bob
doing
as
usual
the
thing
that
he
ought
not
to
have
done
in
the
matter
of
our
hens
was
a
constant
source
of
inconvenience
from
the
first
he
had
seemed
to
regard
the
of
our
stock
purely
in
the
nature
of
a
tribute
to
his
sporting
tastes
he
had
a
fixed
idea
that
he
was
a
hunting
dog
and
that
recognising
this
we
had
very
decently
provided
him
with
the
material
for
the
chase
behind
bob
came
ukridge
but
a
glance
was
enough
to
tell
me
that
he
was
a
negligible
factor
in
the
pursuit
he
was
not
built
for
speed
already
the
pace
had
proved
too
much
for
him
and
he
had
appointed
me
his
deputy
with
full
powers
to
act
after
her
garny
old
horse
valuable
bird
must
be
lost
when
not
in
a
catalepsy
of
literary
composition
i
am
essentially
the
man
of
action
i
laid
aside
my
novel
for
future
reference
and
we
passed
out
of
the
paddock
in
the
following
order
first
aunt
elizabeth
as
fresh
as
paint
going
well
next
bob
panting
and
obviously
doubtful
of
his
powers
of
staying
the
distance
lastly
myself
determined
but
wishing
i
were
five
years
younger
after
the
first
field
bob
like
the
dilettante
and
unstable
dog
he
was
gave
it
up
and
sauntered
off
to
scratch
at
a
with
an
insufferable
air
of
suggesting
that
that
was
what
he
had
come
out
for
all
the
time
i
continued
to
pound
along
doggedly
i
was
grimly
resolute
i
had
caught
aunt
elizabeth
eye
as
she
passed
me
and
the
contempt
in
it
had
cut
me
to
the
quick
this
bird
despised
me
i
am
not
a
violent
or
a
man
but
i
have
my
i
will
not
be
sneered
at
by
hens
all
the
abstract
desire
for
fame
which
had
filled
my
mind
five
minutes
before
was
concentrated
now
on
the
task
of
capturing
this
supercilious
bird
we
had
been
travelling
down
hill
all
this
time
but
at
this
point
we
crossed
a
road
and
the
ground
began
to
rise
i
was
in
that
painful
condition
which
occurs
when
one
has
lost
one
first
wind
and
has
not
yet
got
one
second
i
was
hotter
than
i
had
ever
been
in
my
life
whether
aunt
elizabeth
too
was
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
her
run
or
whether
she
did
it
out
of
the
pure
effrontery
of
her
warped
and
unpleasant
nature
i
do
not
know
but
she
now
slowed
down
to
walk
and
even
began
to
peck
in
a
tentative
manner
at
the
grass
her
behaviour
infuriated
me
i
felt
that
i
was
being
treated
as
a
cipher
i
vowed
that
this
bird
should
realise
yet
even
if
as
seemed
probable
i
burst
in
the
process
that
it
was
no
light
matter
to
be
pursued
by
garnet
author
of
the
manoeuvres
of
arthur
a
man
of
whose
work
so
capable
a
judge
as
the
peebles
had
said
shows
promise
a
judicious
increase
of
pace
brought
me
within
a
yard
or
two
of
my
quarry
but
aunt
elizabeth
apparently
distrait
had
the
situation
well
in
hand
she
darted
from
me
with
an
amused
chuckle
and
moved
off
rapidly
again
up
the
hill
i
followed
but
there
was
that
within
me
that
told
me
i
had
shot
my
bolt
the
sun
blazed
down
concentrating
its
rays
on
my
back
to
the
exclusion
of
the
surrounding
scenery
it
seemed
to
follow
me
about
like
a
limelight
we
had
reached
level
ground
aunt
elizabeth
had
again
slowed
to
a
walk
and
i
was
capable
of
no
better
pace
very
gradually
i
closed
in
there
was
a
high
boxwood
hedge
in
front
of
us
and
just
as
i
came
close
enough
once
more
to
stake
my
all
on
a
single
grab
aunt
elizabeth
with
another
of
her
sardonic
chuckles
dived
in
and
struggled
through
in
the
mysterious
way
in
which
birds
do
get
through
hedges
the
sound
of
her
faint
snigger
came
to
me
as
i
stood
panting
and
roused
me
like
a
bugle
the
next
moment
i
too
had
plunged
into
the
hedge
i
was
in
the
middle
of
it
very
hot
tired
and
dirty
when
from
the
other
side
i
heard
a
sudden
shout
of
mark
over
bird
to
the
right
and
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
emerging
with
a
black
face
and
tottering
knees
on
the
gravel
path
of
a
private
garden
beyond
the
path
was
a
croquet
lawn
and
on
this
lawn
i
perceived
as
through
a
glass
darkly
three
figures
the
mist
cleared
from
my
eyes
and
i
recognised
two
of
them
one
was
the
irishman
who
had
travelled
down
with
us
in
the
train
the
other
was
his
daughter
the
third
member
of
the
party
was
a
man
a
stranger
to
me
by
some
miracle
of
adroitness
he
had
captured
aunt
elizabeth
and
was
holding
her
in
spite
of
her
protests
in
a
workmanlike
manner
behind
the
wings
chapter
vii
the
entente
cordiale
is
sealed
there
are
moments
and
moments
the
present
one
belonged
to
the
more
painful
variety
even
to
my
exhausted
mind
it
was
plain
that
there
was
a
need
here
for
explanations
an
irishman
is
his
castle
and
strangers
can
not
plunge
in
through
hedges
without
inviting
comment
unfortunately
speech
was
beyond
me
i
could
have
emptied
a
laid
down
and
gone
to
sleep
or
melted
ice
with
a
touch
of
the
finger
but
i
could
not
speak
the
conversation
was
opened
by
the
other
man
in
whose
restraining
hand
aunt
elizabeth
now
lay
outwardly
resigned
but
inwardly
as
i
who
knew
her
haughty
spirit
could
guess
boiling
with
baffled
resentment
i
could
see
her
looking
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
trying
to
estimate
the
chances
of
getting
in
one
good
hard
peck
with
her
aquiline
beak
come
right
in
said
the
man
pleasantly
do
knock
i
stood
there
gasping
i
was
only
too
well
aware
that
i
presented
a
quaint
appearance
i
had
removed
my
hat
before
entering
the
hedge
and
my
hair
was
full
of
twigs
and
other
foreign
substances
my
face
was
moist
and
grimy
my
mouth
hung
open
my
legs
felt
as
if
they
had
ceased
to
belong
to
me
i
must
apol
i
began
and
ended
the
sentence
with
gulps
the
elderly
gentleman
looked
at
me
with
what
seemed
to
be
indignant
surprise
his
daughter
appeared
to
my
guilty
conscience
to
be
looking
through
me
aunt
elizabeth
sneered
the
only
friendly
face
was
the
man
he
regarded
me
with
a
kindly
smile
as
if
i
were
some
old
friend
who
had
dropped
in
unexpectedly
take
a
long
breath
he
advised
i
took
several
and
felt
better
i
must
apologise
for
this
intrusion
i
said
successfully
unwarrantable
would
have
rounded
off
the
sentence
neatly
but
i
would
not
risk
it
it
would
have
been
mere
bravado
to
attempt
unnecessary
words
of
five
syllables
i
took
in
more
breath
the
fact
is
i
did
did
know
there
was
a
private
garden
beyond
the
hedge
if
you
will
give
me
my
hen
i
stopped
aunt
elizabeth
was
looking
away
as
if
endeavouring
to
create
an
impression
of
having
nothing
to
do
with
me
i
am
told
by
one
who
knows
that
hens
can
not
raise
their
eyebrows
not
having
any
but
i
am
prepared
to
swear
that
at
this
moment
aunt
elizabeth
raised
hers
i
will
go
further
she
sniffed
here
you
are
said
the
man
though
it
hard
to
say
he
held
out
the
hen
to
me
and
at
this
point
a
hitch
occurred
he
did
his
part
the
letting
go
all
right
it
was
in
my
department
the
taking
hold
that
the
thing
was
bungled
aunt
elizabeth
slipped
from
my
grasp
like
an
eel
stood
for
a
moment
eyeing
me
satirically
with
her
head
on
one
side
then
fled
and
entrenched
herself
in
some
bushes
at
the
end
of
the
lawn
there
are
times
when
the
most
resolute
man
feels
that
he
can
battle
no
longer
with
fate
when
everything
seems
against
him
and
the
only
course
is
a
dignified
retreat
but
there
is
one
thing
essential
to
a
dignified
retreat
you
must
know
the
way
out
it
was
the
lack
of
that
knowledge
that
kept
me
standing
there
looking
more
foolish
than
anyone
has
ever
looked
since
the
world
began
i
could
not
retire
by
way
of
the
hedge
if
i
could
have
leaped
the
hedge
with
a
single
debonair
bound
that
would
have
been
satisfactory
but
the
hedge
was
high
and
i
did
not
feel
capable
at
the
moment
of
achieving
a
debonair
bound
over
a
footstool
the
man
saved
the
situation
he
seemed
to
possess
that
magnetic
power
over
his
fellows
which
marks
the
born
leader
under
his
command
we
became
an
organised
army
the
common
object
the
pursuit
of
the
elusive
aunt
elizabeth
made
us
friends
in
the
first
minute
of
the
proceedings
the
irishman
was
addressing
me
as
me
dear
boy
and
the
man
who
had
introduced
himself
as
chase
a
lieutenant
i
learned
later
in
his
majesty
navy
was
shouting
directions
to
me
by
name
i
have
never
assisted
at
any
ceremony
at
which
formality
was
so
completely
dispensed
with
the
ice
was
not
merely
broken
it
was
shivered
into
a
million
fragments
go
in
and
drive
her
out
garnet
shouted
chase
in
my
direction
if
you
can
look
out
on
the
left
phyllis
even
in
that
disturbing
moment
i
could
not
help
noticing
his
use
of
the
christian
name
it
seemed
to
me
more
than
sinister
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
dashing
young
lieutenants
in
the
senior
service
calling
a
girl
phyllis
whose
eyes
had
haunted
me
since
i
had
first
seen
them
nevertheless
i
crawled
into
the
bushes
and
administered
to
aunt
elizabeth
a
prod
in
the
lower
ribs
if
hens
have
lower
ribs
the
more
i
study
hens
the
more
things
they
seem
able
to
get
along
without
which
abruptly
disturbed
her
calm
detachment
she
shot
out
at
the
spot
where
chase
was
waiting
with
his
coat
off
and
was
promptly
enveloped
in
that
garment
and
captured
the
essence
of
strategy
observed
chase
approvingly
is
surprise
a
neat
piece
of
work
i
thanked
him
he
deprecated
my
thanks
he
had
he
said
only
done
his
duty
as
expected
to
by
england
he
then
introduced
me
to
the
elderly
irishman
who
was
it
seemed
a
professor
at
dublin
university
by
name
derrick
whatever
it
was
that
he
professed
it
was
something
that
did
not
keep
him
for
a
great
deal
of
his
time
at
the
university
he
informed
me
that
he
always
spent
his
summers
at
combe
regis
i
was
surprised
to
see
you
at
combe
regis
i
said
when
you
got
out
at
yeovil
i
thought
i
had
seen
the
last
of
you
i
think
i
am
gifted
beyond
other
men
as
regards
the
unfortunate
turning
of
sentences
i
meant
i
added
i
was
afraid
i
had
ah
of
course
he
said
you
were
in
our
carriage
coming
down
i
was
confident
i
had
seen
you
before
i
never
forget
a
face
it
would
be
a
kindness
said
chase
if
you
would
forget
as
now
exhibited
you
seem
to
have
collected
a
good
deal
of
the
scenery
coming
through
that
hedge
i
was
wondering
i
said
a
wash
if
i
might
of
course
me
boy
of
course
said
the
professor
tom
take
garnet
off
to
your
room
and
then
we
have
lunch
you
stay
to
lunch
mr
garnet
i
thanked
him
commented
on
possible
inconvenience
to
his
arrangements
was
overruled
and
went
off
with
my
friend
the
lieutenant
to
the
house
we
imprisoned
aunt
elizabeth
in
the
stables
to
her
profound
indignation
gave
directions
for
lunch
to
be
served
to
her
and
made
our
way
to
chase
room
so
you
met
the
professor
before
he
said
hospitably
laying
out
a
change
of
raiment
for
me
we
were
fortunately
much
of
a
height
and
build
i
have
never
spoken
to
him
i
said
we
travelled
down
from
london
in
the
same
carriage
he
a
dear
old
boy
if
you
rub
him
the
right
way
but
i
telling
you
this
for
your
good
and
guidance
a
man
wants
a
chart
in
a
strange
sea
he
can
cut
up
rough
and
when
he
does
he
goes
off
like
a
and
the
population
for
miles
round
climbs
trees
i
think
if
i
were
you
i
should
mention
sir
edward
carson
at
lunch
i
promised
that
i
would
try
to
avoid
the
temptation
in
fact
you
better
keep
off
ireland
altogether
it
the
safest
plan
any
other
subject
you
like
chatty
remarks
on
bimetallism
would
meet
with
his
earnest
attention
a
lecture
on
what
to
do
with
the
cold
mutton
would
be
welcomed
but
not
ireland
shall
we
do
down
we
got
to
know
each
other
at
lunch
do
you
hunt
hens
asked
tom
chase
who
was
mixing
the
salad
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
seemed
to
do
everything
a
shade
better
than
anyone
else
for
amusement
or
by
your
doctor
orders
many
doctors
i
believe
insist
on
it
neither
i
said
and
especially
not
for
amusement
the
fact
is
been
lured
down
here
by
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
started
a
chicken
farm
i
was
interrupted
all
three
of
them
burst
out
laughing
tom
chase
allowed
the
vinegar
to
trickle
on
to
the
cloth
missing
the
by
a
clear
two
inches
you
do
mean
to
tell
us
he
said
that
you
really
come
from
the
one
and
only
chicken
farm
why
you
the
man
we
all
been
praying
to
meet
for
days
past
you
the
talk
of
the
town
if
you
can
call
combe
regis
a
town
everybody
is
discussing
you
your
methods
are
new
and
original
are
they
probably
ukridge
knows
nothing
about
fowls
i
know
less
he
considers
it
an
advantage
he
says
our
minds
ought
to
be
unbiassed
ukridge
said
the
professor
that
was
the
name
old
dawlish
the
grocer
said
i
never
forget
a
name
he
is
the
gentleman
who
lectures
on
the
management
of
poultry
you
do
not
i
hastened
to
disclaim
any
such
feat
i
had
never
really
approved
of
these
infernal
talks
on
the
art
of
which
ukridge
had
dropped
into
the
habit
of
delivering
when
anybody
visited
our
farm
i
admit
that
it
was
a
pleasing
spectacle
to
see
my
managing
director
in
a
pink
shirt
without
a
collar
and
very
dirty
flannel
trousers
lecturing
the
intelligent
native
but
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
thing
tended
to
expose
our
ignorance
to
men
who
had
probably
had
to
do
with
fowls
from
their
cradle
up
his
lectures
are
very
popular
said
phyllis
derrick
with
a
little
splutter
of
mirth
he
enjoys
them
i
said
look
here
garnet
said
tom
chase
i
hope
you
wo
consider
all
these
questions
impertinent
but
you
no
notion
of
the
thrilling
interest
we
all
take
at
a
distance
in
your
farm
we
have
been
talking
of
nothing
else
for
a
week
i
have
dreamed
of
it
three
nights
running
is
ukridge
doing
this
as
a
commercial
speculation
or
is
he
an
eccentric
millionaire
he
not
a
millionaire
yet
but
i
believe
he
intends
to
be
one
shortly
with
the
assistance
of
the
fowls
but
you
must
look
on
me
as
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
arrangements
at
the
farm
i
am
merely
a
labourer
the
brainwork
of
the
business
lies
in
ukridge
department
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
came
down
here
principally
in
search
of
golf
golf
said
professor
derrick
with
the
benevolent
approval
of
the
enthusiast
towards
a
brother
i
glad
you
play
golf
we
must
have
a
round
together
as
soon
as
ever
my
professional
duties
will
permit
i
said
gratefully
there
was
croquet
after
lunch
a
game
of
which
i
am
a
poor
performer
phyllis
derrick
and
i
played
the
professor
and
tom
chase
chase
was
a
little
better
than
myself
the
professor
by
dint
of
extreme
earnestness
and
care
managed
to
play
a
fair
game
and
phyllis
was
an
expert
i
was
reading
a
book
she
said
as
we
stood
together
watching
the
professor
shaping
at
his
ball
at
the
other
end
of
the
lawn
by
an
author
of
the
same
surname
as
you
garnet
is
he
a
relation
of
yours
my
name
is
jeremy
miss
derrick
oh
you
wrote
it
she
turned
a
little
pink
then
you
must
have
oh
nothing
i
could
help
it
i
afraid
did
you
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
i
guessed
you
were
going
to
say
that
i
must
have
heard
your
criticisms
in
the
train
you
were
very
lenient
i
thought
i
did
like
your
heroine
no
what
is
a
miss
derrick
pamela
in
your
book
is
a
she
replied
unsatisfactorily
shortly
after
this
the
game
came
somehow
to
an
end
i
do
not
understand
the
intricacies
of
croquet
but
phyllis
did
something
brilliant
and
remarkable
with
the
balls
and
we
adjourned
for
tea
the
sun
was
setting
as
i
left
to
return
to
the
farm
with
aunt
elizabeth
stored
neatly
in
a
basket
in
my
hand
the
air
was
deliciously
cool
and
full
of
that
strange
quiet
which
follows
soothingly
on
the
skirts
of
a
broiling
midsummer
afternoon
far
away
seeming
to
come
from
another
world
a
tinkled
deepening
the
silence
alone
in
a
sky
of
the
palest
blue
there
gleamed
a
small
bright
star
i
addressed
this
star
she
was
certainly
very
nice
to
me
very
nice
indeed
the
star
said
nothing
on
the
other
hand
i
take
it
that
having
had
a
decent
she
would
have
been
equally
polite
to
any
other
man
whom
she
had
happened
to
meet
at
her
father
house
moreover
i
do
feel
altogether
easy
in
my
mind
about
that
naval
chap
i
fear
the
worst
the
star
winked
he
calls
her
phyllis
i
said
charawk
chuckled
aunt
elizabeth
from
her
basket
in
that
beastly
cynical
satirical
way
which
has
made
her
so
disliked
by
all
people
chapter
viii
a
little
dinner
at
edwin
comes
said
ukridge
and
the
derricks
said
ukridge
sawing
at
the
bread
in
his
energetic
way
do
forget
the
derricks
millie
no
dear
beale
is
going
to
give
us
a
very
nice
dinner
we
talked
it
over
yesterday
who
is
edwin
i
asked
we
were
finishing
breakfast
on
the
second
morning
after
my
visit
to
the
derricks
i
had
related
my
adventures
to
the
staff
of
the
farm
on
my
return
laying
stress
on
the
merits
of
our
neighbours
and
their
interest
in
our
doings
and
the
hired
retainer
had
been
sent
off
next
morning
with
a
note
from
ukridge
inviting
them
to
look
over
the
farm
and
stay
to
dinner
edwin
said
ukridge
oh
beast
of
a
cat
oh
stanley
said
ukridge
plaintively
he
not
he
such
a
dear
garnet
a
beautiful
persian
he
has
taken
prizes
he
always
taking
something
that
why
he
did
come
down
with
us
a
great
horrid
of
a
dog
bit
him
garnet
and
poor
edwin
had
to
go
to
a
cats
hospital
and
i
hope
said
ukridge
the
experience
will
do
him
good
sneaked
a
dog
dinner
garnet
under
his
very
nose
if
you
please
naturally
the
dog
lodged
a
protest
i
so
afraid
that
he
will
be
frightened
of
bob
he
will
be
very
timid
and
bob
so
boisterous
is
he
mr
garnet
that
all
right
said
ukridge
bob
wo
hurt
him
unless
he
tries
to
steal
his
dinner
in
that
case
we
will
have
edwin
made
into
a
rug
stanley
does
like
edwin
said
ukridge
sadly
edwin
arrived
early
in
the
afternoon
and
was
shut
into
the
kitchen
he
struck
me
as
a
handsome
cat
but
nervous
the
derricks
followed
two
hours
later
chase
was
not
of
the
party
tom
had
to
go
to
london
explained
the
professor
or
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
come
it
was
a
disappointment
to
the
boy
for
he
wanted
to
see
the
farm
he
must
come
some
other
time
said
ukridge
we
invite
inspection
look
here
he
broke
off
suddenly
we
were
nearing
the
now
ukridge
walking
in
front
with
phyllis
derrick
were
you
ever
at
bristol
never
sir
said
the
professor
because
i
knew
just
such
another
fat
little
buffer
there
a
few
years
ago
gay
old
bird
he
was
he
this
is
the
professor
i
broke
in
with
a
moist
tingling
feeling
across
my
forehead
and
up
my
spine
i
saw
the
professor
stiffen
as
he
walked
while
his
face
deepened
in
colour
ukridge
breezy
way
of
expressing
himself
is
apt
to
electrify
the
stranger
you
will
notice
the
able
way
ha
ha
in
which
the
is
arranged
i
continued
feverishly
took
some
doing
that
by
jove
yes
it
was
hot
work
nice
lot
of
fowls
are
they
rather
a
mixed
lot
of
course
ha
ha
that
the
dealer
fault
though
we
are
getting
quite
a
number
of
eggs
now
hens
would
lay
at
first
could
make
them
i
babbled
on
till
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
i
saw
the
flush
fade
from
the
professor
face
and
his
back
gradually
relax
its
attitude
the
situation
was
saved
for
the
moment
but
there
was
no
knowing
what
further
excesses
ukridge
might
indulge
in
i
managed
to
draw
him
aside
as
we
went
through
the
and
expostulated
for
goodness
sake
be
careful
i
whispered
you
no
notion
how
touchy
he
is
but
said
nothing
he
replied
amazed
hang
it
you
know
nobody
likes
to
be
called
a
fat
little
buffer
to
his
face
what
my
dear
old
man
nobody
minds
a
little
thing
like
that
we
be
stilted
and
formal
it
ever
so
much
more
friendly
to
relax
and
be
chummy
here
we
rejoined
the
others
and
i
was
left
with
a
leaden
foreboding
of
gruesome
things
in
store
i
knew
what
manner
of
man
ukridge
was
when
he
relaxed
and
became
chummy
friendships
of
years
standing
had
failed
to
survive
the
test
for
the
time
being
however
all
went
well
in
his
role
of
lecturer
he
offended
no
one
and
phyllis
and
her
father
behaved
admirably
they
received
his
strangest
theories
without
a
twitch
of
the
mouth
ah
the
professor
would
say
now
is
that
really
so
very
interesting
indeed
only
once
when
ukridge
was
describing
some
more
than
usually
original
device
for
the
furthering
of
the
interests
of
his
fowls
did
a
slight
spasm
disturb
phyllis
look
of
attentive
reverence
and
you
have
really
had
no
previous
experience
in
she
said
none
said
ukridge
beaming
through
his
glasses
not
an
atom
but
i
can
turn
my
hand
to
anything
you
know
things
seem
to
come
naturally
to
me
somehow
i
see
said
phyllis
it
was
while
matters
were
progressing
with
this
beautiful
smoothness
that
i
observed
the
square
form
of
the
hired
retainer
approaching
us
somehow
i
can
not
say
why
i
had
a
feeling
that
he
came
with
bad
news
perhaps
it
was
his
air
of
quiet
satisfaction
which
struck
me
as
ominous
beg
pardon
ukridge
sir
ukridge
was
in
the
middle
of
a
very
eloquent
excursus
on
the
feeding
of
fowls
a
subject
on
which
he
held
views
of
his
own
as
ingenious
as
they
were
novel
the
interruption
annoyed
him
well
beale
he
said
what
is
it
that
there
cat
sir
what
came
oh
beale
cried
ukridge
in
agitation
has
happened
having
something
to
say
to
the
missis
what
has
happened
oh
beale
do
say
that
edwin
has
been
hurt
where
is
he
oh
edwin
having
something
to
say
to
the
missis
if
bob
has
bitten
him
i
hope
he
had
his
nose
scratched
said
ukridge
vindictively
having
something
to
say
to
the
missis
resumed
the
hired
retainer
tranquilly
i
went
into
the
kitchen
ten
minutes
back
the
cat
was
sitting
on
the
mat
beale
narrative
style
closely
resembled
that
of
a
certain
book
i
had
read
in
my
infancy
i
wish
i
could
remember
its
title
it
was
a
book
yes
beale
yes
said
ukridge
oh
do
go
on
puss
i
says
to
him
are
sir
careful
says
the
missis
that
timid
she
says
would
believe
she
says
only
just
settled
down
as
you
may
say
she
says
do
you
fret
i
says
to
her
and
me
understands
each
other
and
me
i
says
old
friends
my
dear
old
pal
corporal
banks
she
grinned
at
that
corporal
banks
being
a
man
we
many
a
laugh
at
in
the
old
days
was
in
a
manner
of
speaking
a
joke
between
us
oh
do
go
on
beale
what
has
happened
to
edwin
the
hired
retainer
proceeded
in
calm
even
tones
we
was
talking
there
when
bob
what
had
followed
me
unknown
trotted
in
when
the
cat
ketched
sight
of
sniffing
about
there
was
such
a
spitting
and
swearing
as
you
never
and
blowed
said
beale
amusedly
blowed
if
the
old
cat
did
give
one
jump
and
move
in
quick
time
up
the
chimney
where
now
remains
paying
no
to
the
missis
attempts
to
get
him
down
again
sensation
as
they
say
in
the
reports
but
he
be
cooked
cried
phyllis
no
he
wo
nor
will
our
dinner
beale
always
lets
the
kitchen
fire
out
during
the
afternoon
and
how
she
going
to
light
it
with
that
there
was
a
pause
while
one
might
count
three
it
was
plain
that
the
speaker
was
struggling
with
that
cat
he
concluded
safely
up
the
chimney
it
a
cold
dinner
we
get
if
that
cat
does
come
down
the
professor
face
fell
i
had
remarked
on
the
occasion
when
i
had
lunched
with
him
his
evident
fondness
for
the
pleasures
of
the
table
cold
impromptu
dinners
were
plainly
not
to
his
taste
we
went
to
the
kitchen
in
a
body
beale
was
standing
in
front
of
the
empty
grate
making
seductive
up
the
chimney
what
all
this
mrs
beale
said
ukridge
he
wo
come
down
sir
not
while
he
thinks
bob
about
and
how
to
cook
dinner
for
five
with
him
up
the
chimney
i
do
see
sir
prod
at
him
with
a
broom
handle
beale
said
ukridge
oh
do
hurt
poor
edwin
said
ukridge
i
tried
that
sir
but
i
ca
reach
him
and
i
only
bin
and
drove
further
up
what
must
be
added
beale
philosophically
must
be
he
may
come
down
of
his
own
accord
in
the
night
then
what
we
must
do
said
ukridge
in
a
jovial
manner
which
to
me
at
least
seemed
out
of
place
is
to
have
a
regular
jolly
what
whack
up
whatever
we
have
in
the
larder
and
eat
that
a
regular
jolly
repeated
the
professor
gloomily
i
could
read
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
remorse
for
having
come
at
all
and
a
faint
hope
that
it
might
not
be
too
late
to
back
out
of
it
that
will
be
splendid
said
phyllis
er
i
think
my
dear
sir
said
her
father
it
would
be
hardly
fair
for
us
to
give
any
further
trouble
to
ukridge
and
yourself
if
you
will
allow
me
therefore
i
will
ukridge
became
gushingly
hospitable
he
refused
to
think
of
allowing
his
guests
to
go
empty
away
he
would
be
able
to
whack
up
something
he
said
there
was
quite
a
good
deal
of
the
ham
left
he
was
sure
he
appealed
to
me
to
endorse
his
view
that
there
was
a
tin
of
sardines
and
part
of
a
cold
fowl
and
plenty
of
bread
and
cheese
and
after
all
he
said
speaking
for
the
whole
company
in
the
generous
comprehensive
way
enthusiasts
have
what
more
do
we
want
in
weather
like
this
a
nice
light
cold
dinner
is
ever
so
much
better
for
us
than
a
lot
of
hot
things
we
strolled
out
again
into
the
garden
but
somehow
things
seemed
to
drag
conversation
was
fitful
except
on
the
part
of
ukridge
who
continued
to
talk
easily
on
all
subjects
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
the
party
was
depressed
and
at
least
one
of
his
guests
rapidly
becoming
irritable
i
watched
the
professor
furtively
as
ukridge
talked
on
and
that
ominous
phrase
of
chase
concerning
guns
kept
coming
into
my
mind
if
ukridge
were
to
tread
on
any
of
his
pet
corns
as
he
might
at
any
minute
there
would
be
an
explosion
the
snatching
of
the
dinner
from
his
very
mouth
as
it
were
and
the
substitution
of
a
and
sardines
menu
had
brought
him
to
the
frame
of
mind
when
men
turn
and
rend
their
nearest
and
dearest
the
sight
of
the
table
when
at
length
we
filed
into
the
dining
room
sent
a
chill
through
me
it
was
a
meal
for
the
very
young
or
the
very
hungry
the
uncompromising
coldness
and
solidity
of
the
viands
was
enough
to
appall
a
man
conscious
that
his
digestion
needed
humouring
a
huge
cheese
faced
us
in
almost
a
swashbuckling
way
i
do
not
know
how
else
to
describe
it
it
wore
a
blatant
rakish
air
and
i
noticed
that
the
professor
shivered
slightly
as
he
saw
it
sardines
looking
more
oily
and
uninviting
than
anything
i
had
ever
seen
appeared
in
their
native
tin
beyond
the
loaf
of
bread
there
was
a
ham
in
its
third
quarter
and
a
chicken
which
had
suffered
heavily
during
a
previous
visit
to
the
table
finally
a
black
bottle
of
whisky
stood
grimly
beside
plate
the
professor
looked
the
sort
of
man
who
drank
claret
of
a
special
year
or
nothing
we
got
through
the
meal
somehow
and
did
our
best
to
delude
ourselves
into
the
idea
that
it
was
all
great
fun
but
it
was
a
shallow
pretence
the
professor
was
very
silent
by
the
time
we
had
finished
ukridge
had
been
terrible
the
professor
had
forced
himself
to
be
genial
he
had
tried
to
talk
he
had
told
stories
and
when
he
began
one
his
stories
would
have
been
the
better
for
a
little
more
briskness
and
condensation
ukridge
almost
invariably
interrupted
him
before
he
had
got
half
way
through
without
a
word
of
apology
and
started
on
some
anecdote
of
his
own
he
furthermore
disagreed
with
nearly
every
opinion
the
professor
expressed
it
is
true
that
he
did
it
all
in
such
a
perfectly
friendly
way
and
was
obviously
so
innocent
of
any
intention
of
giving
offence
that
another
man
or
the
same
man
at
a
better
meal
might
have
overlooked
the
matter
but
the
professor
robbed
of
his
good
dinner
was
at
the
stage
when
he
had
to
attack
somebody
every
moment
i
had
been
expecting
the
storm
to
burst
it
burst
after
dinner
we
were
strolling
in
the
garden
when
some
demon
urged
ukridge
apropos
of
the
professor
mention
of
dublin
to
start
upon
the
irish
question
i
had
been
expecting
it
momentarily
but
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
when
it
actually
arrived
ukridge
probably
knew
less
about
the
irish
question
than
any
male
adult
in
the
kingdom
but
he
had
boomed
forth
some
very
positive
opinions
of
his
own
on
the
subject
before
i
could
get
near
enough
to
him
to
whisper
a
warning
when
i
did
i
suppose
i
must
have
whispered
louder
than
i
had
intended
for
the
professor
heard
me
and
my
words
acted
as
the
match
to
the
powder
he
touchy
about
ireland
is
he
he
thundered
drop
it
is
it
and
why
why
sir
i
one
of
the
best
tempered
men
that
ever
came
from
dublin
let
me
tell
you
and
i
will
not
stay
here
to
be
insulted
by
the
insinuation
that
i
can
not
discuss
ireland
as
calmly
as
any
one
in
this
company
or
out
of
it
touchy
about
ireland
is
it
touchy
but
professor
take
your
hand
off
my
arm
garnet
i
will
not
be
treated
like
a
child
i
am
as
competent
to
discuss
the
affairs
of
ireland
without
heat
as
any
man
let
me
tell
you
father
and
let
me
tell
you
ukridge
that
i
consider
your
opinions
poisonous
poisonous
sir
and
you
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
subject
sir
every
word
you
say
betrays
your
profound
ignorance
i
do
wish
to
see
you
or
to
speak
to
you
again
understand
that
sir
our
acquaintance
began
and
it
will
cease
to
you
sir
come
phyllis
me
dear
ukridge
chapter
ix
dies
irae
why
is
it
i
wonder
that
stories
of
retribution
calling
at
the
wrong
address
strike
us
as
funny
instead
of
pathetic
i
myself
had
been
amused
by
them
many
a
time
in
a
book
which
i
had
read
only
a
few
days
before
our
party
a
annoyed
with
an
omnibus
conductor
had
thrown
a
superannuated
orange
at
him
it
had
found
its
billet
not
on
him
but
on
a
perfectly
inoffensive
spectator
the
missile
said
the
writer
a
young
copper
full
in
the
hyeball
i
had
enjoyed
this
when
i
read
it
but
now
that
fate
had
arranged
a
precisely
similar
situation
with
myself
in
the
role
of
the
young
copper
the
fun
of
the
thing
appealed
to
me
not
at
all
it
was
ukridge
who
was
to
blame
for
the
professor
regrettable
explosion
and
departure
and
he
ought
by
all
laws
of
justice
to
have
suffered
for
it
as
it
was
i
was
the
only
person
materially
affected
it
did
not
matter
to
ukridge
he
did
not
care
twopence
one
way
or
the
other
if
the
professor
were
friendly
he
was
willing
to
talk
to
him
by
the
hour
on
any
subject
pleasant
or
unpleasant
if
on
the
other
hand
he
wished
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
us
it
did
not
worry
him
he
was
content
to
let
him
go
ukridge
was
a
person
but
to
me
it
was
a
serious
matter
more
than
serious
if
i
have
done
my
work
as
historian
with
an
adequate
degree
of
skill
the
reader
should
have
gathered
by
this
time
the
state
of
my
feelings
i
did
not
love
as
others
do
none
ever
did
that
i
heard
tell
of
my
passion
was
a
through
the
town
she
was
of
course
the
belle
of
at
least
it
was
fortunately
not
quite
that
but
it
was
certainly
genuine
and
most
disturbing
and
it
grew
with
the
days
somebody
with
a
taste
for
juggling
with
figures
might
write
a
very
readable
page
or
so
of
statistics
in
connection
with
the
growth
of
love
in
some
cases
it
is
i
believe
slow
in
my
own
i
can
only
say
that
jack
beanstalk
was
a
backward
plant
in
comparison
it
is
true
that
we
had
not
seen
a
great
deal
of
one
another
and
that
when
we
had
met
our
interview
had
been
brief
and
our
conversation
conventional
but
it
is
the
intervals
between
the
meeting
that
do
the
real
damage
absence
i
do
not
claim
the
thought
as
my
own
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
and
now
thanks
to
ukridge
amazing
idiocy
a
barrier
had
been
thrust
between
us
lord
knows
the
business
of
fishing
for
a
girl
heart
is
sufficiently
difficult
and
delicate
without
the
addition
of
needless
obstacles
to
cut
out
the
naval
miscreant
under
equal
conditions
would
have
been
a
task
ample
enough
for
my
modest
needs
it
was
terrible
to
have
to
myself
in
the
good
graces
of
the
professor
before
i
could
so
much
as
begin
to
dream
of
phyllis
ukridge
gave
me
no
balm
well
after
all
he
said
when
i
pointed
out
to
him
quietly
but
plainly
my
opinion
of
his
tactlessness
what
does
it
matter
old
derrick
is
the
only
person
in
the
world
if
he
does
want
to
know
us
laddie
we
just
jolly
well
pull
ourselves
together
and
stagger
along
without
him
it
quite
possible
to
be
happy
without
knowing
old
derrick
millions
of
people
are
going
about
the
world
at
this
moment
singing
like
larks
out
of
pure
who
do
even
know
of
his
existence
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
old
horse
we
have
time
to
waste
making
friends
and
being
the
social
pets
too
much
to
do
on
the
farm
strict
business
is
the
watchword
my
boy
we
must
be
the
keen
tense
men
of
affairs
or
before
we
know
where
we
are
we
shall
find
ourselves
right
in
the
gumbo
i
noticed
garny
old
horse
that
you
have
been
the
whale
for
work
lately
that
you
might
be
you
must
buckle
to
laddie
there
must
be
no
slackness
we
are
at
a
critical
stage
on
our
work
now
depends
the
success
of
the
speculation
look
at
those
damned
cocks
always
fighting
heave
a
stone
at
them
laddie
while
you
up
the
matter
with
you
you
seem
pipped
ca
get
the
novel
off
your
chest
or
what
you
take
my
tip
and
give
your
brain
a
rest
nothing
like
manual
labour
for
clearing
the
brain
all
the
doctors
say
so
those
coops
ought
to
be
painted
or
mind
you
i
think
old
derrick
would
be
all
right
if
one
persevered
and
did
call
him
a
fat
little
buffer
and
contradict
everything
he
said
and
spoil
all
his
stories
by
breaking
in
with
chestnuts
of
your
own
in
the
middle
i
interrupted
with
bitterness
my
dear
old
son
he
did
mind
being
called
a
fat
little
buffer
you
keep
harping
on
that
it
no
discredit
to
a
man
to
be
a
fat
little
buffer
some
of
the
noblest
men
i
have
met
have
been
fat
little
buffers
what
was
the
matter
with
old
derrick
was
a
touch
of
liver
i
said
to
myself
when
i
saw
him
eating
cheese
fellow
going
to
have
a
nasty
shooting
pain
sooner
or
later
i
say
laddie
just
heave
another
rock
or
two
at
those
cocks
will
you
they
slay
each
other
i
had
hoped
fearing
the
while
that
there
was
not
much
chance
of
such
a
thing
happening
that
the
professor
might
get
over
his
feeling
of
injury
during
the
night
and
be
as
friendly
as
ever
next
day
but
he
was
evidently
a
man
who
had
no
objection
whatever
to
letting
the
sun
go
down
upon
his
wrath
for
when
i
met
him
on
the
following
morning
on
the
beach
he
cut
me
in
the
most
uncompromising
manner
phyllis
was
with
him
at
the
time
and
also
another
girl
who
was
i
supposed
from
the
strong
likeness
between
them
her
sister
she
had
the
same
mass
of
soft
brown
hair
but
to
me
she
appeared
almost
commonplace
in
comparison
it
is
never
pleasant
to
be
cut
dead
even
when
you
have
done
something
to
deserve
it
it
is
like
treading
on
nothing
where
one
imagined
a
stair
to
be
in
the
present
instance
the
pang
was
mitigated
to
a
certain
extent
not
largely
by
the
fact
that
phyllis
looked
at
me
she
did
not
move
her
head
and
i
could
not
have
declared
positively
that
she
moved
her
eyes
but
nevertheless
she
certainly
looked
at
me
it
was
something
she
seemed
to
say
that
duty
compelled
her
to
follow
her
father
lead
and
that
the
act
must
not
be
taken
as
evidence
of
any
personal
animus
that
at
least
was
how
i
read
off
the
message
two
days
later
i
met
chase
in
the
village
hullo
so
you
back
i
said
you
discovered
my
secret
he
admitted
will
you
have
a
cigar
or
a
cocoanut
there
was
a
pause
trouble
i
hear
while
i
was
away
he
said
i
nodded
the
man
i
live
with
ukridge
did
what
you
warned
me
against
touched
on
the
irish
question
home
rule
he
mentioned
it
among
other
things
and
the
professor
went
off
like
a
bomb
he
would
so
now
you
have
parted
brass
rags
it
a
pity
i
agreed
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
suppressed
the
desire
to
ask
him
to
use
his
influence
if
any
with
derrick
to
effect
a
reconciliation
i
felt
that
i
must
play
the
game
to
request
one
rival
to
give
one
assistance
in
the
struggle
to
the
end
that
he
may
be
the
more
readily
cut
out
can
hardly
be
considered
cricket
i
ought
not
to
be
speaking
to
you
you
know
said
chase
under
arrest
he
still
i
stopped
for
a
word
very
much
so
i
do
what
i
can
it
very
good
of
you
but
the
time
is
not
yet
ripe
he
may
be
said
at
present
to
be
simmering
down
i
see
thanks
so
long
and
chase
walked
on
with
long
strides
to
the
cob
the
days
passed
slowly
i
saw
nothing
more
of
phyllis
or
her
sister
the
professor
i
met
once
or
twice
on
the
links
i
had
taken
earnestly
to
golf
in
this
time
of
stress
golf
is
the
game
of
disappointed
lovers
on
the
other
hand
it
does
not
follow
that
because
a
man
is
a
failure
as
a
lover
he
will
be
any
good
at
all
on
the
links
my
game
was
distinctly
poor
at
first
but
a
round
or
two
put
me
back
into
my
proper
form
which
is
fair
the
professor
demeanour
at
these
accidental
meetings
on
the
links
was
a
faithful
reproduction
of
his
attitude
on
the
beach
only
by
a
studied
imitation
of
the
absolute
stranger
did
he
show
that
he
had
observed
my
presence
once
or
twice
after
dinner
when
ukridge
was
smoking
one
of
his
special
cigars
while
ukridge
nursed
edwin
now
moving
in
society
once
more
and
in
his
right
mind
i
lit
my
pipe
and
walked
out
across
the
fields
through
the
cool
summer
night
till
i
came
to
the
hedge
that
shut
off
the
derrick
grounds
not
the
hedge
through
which
i
had
made
my
first
entrance
but
another
lower
and
nearer
the
house
standing
there
under
the
shade
of
a
tree
i
could
see
the
lighted
windows
of
the
generally
there
was
music
inside
and
the
windows
being
opened
on
account
of
the
warmth
of
the
night
i
was
able
to
make
myself
a
little
more
miserable
by
hearing
phyllis
sing
it
deepened
the
feeling
of
banishment
i
shall
never
forget
those
furtive
visits
the
intense
stillness
of
the
night
broken
by
an
occasional
rustling
in
the
grass
or
the
hedge
the
smell
of
the
flowers
in
the
garden
beyond
the
distant
drone
of
the
sea
god
makes
sech
nights
all
white
and
still
you
to
look
and
listen
another
day
had
generally
begun
before
i
moved
from
my
and
started
for
home
surprised
to
find
my
limbs
stiff
and
my
clothes
bathed
with
dew
chapter
x
i
enlist
the
services
of
a
minion
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
to
what
extent
the
work
of
authors
is
influenced
by
their
private
affairs
if
life
is
flowing
smoothly
are
the
novels
they
write
in
that
period
of
content
coloured
with
optimism
and
if
things
are
running
crosswise
do
they
work
off
the
resultant
gloom
on
their
faithful
public
if
for
instance
jacobs
had
toothache
would
he
write
like
hugh
walpole
if
maxim
gorky
were
invited
to
lunch
by
trotsky
to
meet
lenin
would
he
sit
down
and
dash
off
a
trifle
in
the
vein
of
stephen
leacock
probably
the
eminent
have
the
power
of
detaching
their
writing
self
from
their
living
self
but
for
my
own
part
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
i
now
found
myself
had
a
disastrous
effect
on
my
novel
that
was
to
be
i
had
designed
it
as
a
light
comedy
effort
here
and
there
a
page
or
two
to
steady
the
reader
and
show
him
what
i
could
do
in
the
way
of
pathos
if
i
cared
to
try
but
in
the
main
a
thing
of
sunshine
and
laughter
but
now
great
slabs
of
gloom
began
to
work
themselves
into
the
scheme
of
it
a
magnificent
despondency
became
its
keynote
it
would
not
do
i
felt
that
i
must
make
a
resolute
effort
to
shake
off
my
depression
more
than
ever
the
need
of
conciliating
the
professor
was
borne
in
upon
me
day
and
night
i
spurred
my
brain
to
think
of
some
suitable
means
of
engineering
a
reconciliation
in
the
meantime
i
worked
hard
among
the
fowls
drove
furiously
on
the
links
and
swam
about
the
harbour
when
the
affairs
of
the
farm
did
not
require
my
attention
things
were
not
going
well
on
our
model
chicken
farm
little
accidents
marred
the
harmony
of
life
in
the
on
one
occasion
a
hen
not
aunt
elizabeth
i
am
sorry
to
say
fell
into
a
pot
of
tar
and
came
out
an
unspeakable
object
ukridge
put
his
spare
pair
of
tennis
shoes
in
the
incubator
to
dry
them
and
permanently
spoiled
the
future
of
eggs
which
happened
to
have
got
there
first
chickens
kept
straying
into
the
wrong
coops
where
they
got
badly
pecked
by
the
residents
edwin
slew
a
couple
of
wyandottes
and
was
only
saved
from
execution
by
the
tears
of
ukridge
in
spite
of
these
occurrences
however
his
buoyant
optimism
never
deserted
ukridge
after
all
he
said
what
one
bird
more
or
less
yes
i
know
i
made
a
fuss
when
that
beast
of
a
cat
lunched
off
those
two
but
that
was
simply
the
principle
of
the
thing
i
not
going
to
pay
large
sums
for
chickens
purely
in
order
that
a
cat
which
i
never
liked
can
lunch
well
still
we
plenty
left
and
the
eggs
are
coming
in
better
now
though
we
still
a
deal
of
leeway
to
make
up
yet
in
that
line
i
got
a
letter
from
whiteley
this
morning
asking
when
my
first
consignment
was
going
to
arrive
you
know
these
people
make
a
mistake
in
hurrying
a
man
it
annoys
him
it
irritates
him
when
we
really
get
going
garny
my
boy
i
shall
drop
whiteley
i
shall
cut
them
out
of
my
list
and
send
my
eggs
to
their
trade
rivals
they
shall
have
a
sharp
lesson
it
a
little
hard
here
am
i
worked
to
death
looking
after
things
down
here
and
these
men
have
the
impertinence
to
bother
me
about
their
wretched
business
come
in
and
have
a
drink
laddie
and
let
talk
it
over
it
was
on
the
morning
after
this
that
i
heard
him
calling
me
in
a
voice
in
which
i
detected
agitation
i
was
strolling
about
the
paddock
as
was
my
habit
after
breakfast
thinking
about
phyllis
and
trying
to
get
my
novel
into
shape
i
had
just
framed
a
more
than
usually
murky
scene
for
use
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
book
when
ukridge
shouted
to
me
from
the
garny
come
here
i
want
you
to
see
the
most
astounding
thing
what
the
matter
i
asked
blast
if
i
know
look
at
those
chickens
they
been
doing
that
for
the
last
i
inspected
the
chickens
there
was
certainly
something
the
matter
with
them
they
were
yawning
broadly
as
if
we
bored
them
they
stood
about
singly
and
in
groups
opening
and
shutting
their
beaks
it
was
an
uncanny
spectacle
what
the
matter
with
them
can
a
chicken
get
a
fit
of
the
blues
i
asked
because
if
so
what
they
got
i
never
saw
a
more
lot
of
birds
oh
do
look
at
that
poor
little
brown
one
by
the
coop
said
ukridge
sympathetically
i
sure
it
not
well
see
it
lying
down
what
be
the
matter
with
it
i
tell
you
what
we
do
said
ukridge
we
ask
beale
he
once
lived
with
an
aunt
who
kept
fowls
he
know
all
about
it
beale
no
answer
beale
a
sturdy
form
in
appeared
through
the
bushes
carrying
a
boot
we
seemed
to
have
interrupted
him
in
the
act
of
cleaning
it
beale
you
know
all
about
fowls
what
the
matter
with
these
chickens
the
hired
retainer
examined
the
blase
birds
with
a
wooden
expression
on
his
face
well
said
ukridge
the
thing
said
the
hired
retainer
is
these
fowls
have
been
and
got
the
roop
i
had
never
heard
of
the
disease
before
but
it
sounded
bad
is
that
what
makes
them
yawn
like
that
said
ukridge
yes
poor
things
yes
and
have
they
all
got
it
yes
what
ought
we
to
do
asked
ukridge
well
my
aunt
sir
when
fowls
the
roop
she
gave
them
snuff
give
them
snuff
she
did
he
repeated
with
relish
every
morning
snuff
said
ukridge
yes
she
give
snuff
till
their
eyes
bubbled
ukridge
uttered
a
faint
squeak
at
this
vivid
piece
of
and
did
it
cure
them
asked
ukridge
no
sir
responded
the
expert
soothingly
oh
go
away
beale
and
clean
your
beastly
boots
said
ukridge
you
no
use
wait
a
minute
who
would
know
about
this
infernal
roop
thing
one
of
those
farmer
chaps
would
i
suppose
beale
go
off
to
the
nearest
farmer
and
give
him
my
compliments
and
ask
him
what
he
does
when
his
fowls
get
the
roop
yes
sir
no
i
go
ukridge
i
said
i
want
some
exercise
i
whistled
to
bob
who
was
investigating
a
in
the
paddock
and
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
village
of
up
lyme
to
consult
farmer
leigh
on
the
matter
he
had
sold
us
some
fowls
shortly
after
our
arrival
so
might
be
expected
to
feel
a
kindly
interest
in
their
ailing
families
the
path
to
up
lyme
lies
across
meadows
at
intervals
it
passes
over
a
stream
by
means
of
a
footbridge
the
stream
curls
through
the
meadows
like
a
snake
and
at
the
first
of
these
bridges
i
met
phyllis
i
came
upon
her
quite
suddenly
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
was
hidden
from
my
view
i
could
hear
somebody
coming
through
the
grass
but
not
till
i
was
on
the
bridge
did
i
see
who
it
was
we
reached
the
bridge
simultaneously
she
was
alone
she
carried
a
all
nice
girls
sketch
a
little
there
was
room
for
one
alone
on
the
footbridge
and
i
drew
back
to
let
her
pass
it
being
the
privilege
of
woman
to
make
the
first
sign
of
recognition
i
said
nothing
i
merely
lifted
my
hat
in
a
fashion
are
you
going
to
cut
me
i
wonder
i
said
to
myself
she
answered
the
unspoken
question
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
answered
garnet
she
said
stopping
at
the
end
of
the
bridge
a
pause
i
could
tell
you
so
before
but
i
am
so
sorry
this
has
happened
oh
thanks
awfully
i
said
realising
as
i
said
it
the
miserable
inadequacy
of
the
english
language
at
a
crisis
when
i
would
have
given
a
month
income
to
have
said
something
neat
epigrammatic
suggestive
yet
withal
courteous
and
respectful
i
could
only
find
a
hackneyed
unenthusiastic
phrase
which
i
should
have
used
in
accepting
an
invitation
from
a
bore
to
lunch
with
him
at
his
club
of
course
you
understand
my
friends
must
be
my
father
friends
yes
i
said
gloomily
i
suppose
so
so
you
must
not
think
me
rude
if
i
i
cut
me
said
i
with
masculine
coarseness
do
seem
to
see
you
said
she
with
feminine
delicacy
when
i
am
with
my
father
you
will
understand
i
shall
understand
you
see
she
smiled
you
are
under
arrest
as
tom
says
tom
i
see
i
said
i
watched
her
out
of
sight
and
went
on
to
interview
leigh
we
had
a
long
and
intensely
uninteresting
conversation
about
the
maladies
to
which
chickens
are
subject
he
was
verbose
and
reminiscent
he
took
me
over
his
farm
pointing
out
as
we
went
dorkings
with
pasts
and
cochin
chinas
which
he
had
cured
of
diseases
generally
fatal
on
as
far
as
i
could
gather
christian
science
principles
i
left
at
last
with
instructions
to
paint
the
throats
of
the
stricken
birds
with
turpentine
a
task
imagination
boggled
at
and
one
which
i
proposed
to
leave
exclusively
to
ukridge
and
the
hired
retainer
and
also
a
slight
headache
a
visit
to
the
cob
would
i
thought
do
me
good
i
had
missed
my
bathe
that
morning
and
was
in
need
of
a
breath
of
it
was
and
there
was
deep
water
on
three
sides
of
the
cob
in
a
small
boat
in
the
offing
professor
derrick
appeared
fishing
i
had
seen
him
engaged
in
this
pursuit
once
or
twice
before
his
only
companion
was
a
gigantic
boatman
by
name
harry
hawk
possibly
a
descendant
of
the
gentleman
of
that
name
who
went
to
widdicombe
fair
with
bill
brewer
and
old
uncle
tom
cobley
and
all
on
a
certain
memorable
occasion
and
assisted
at
the
fatal
accident
to
tom
grey
mare
i
sat
on
the
seat
at
the
end
of
the
cob
and
watched
the
professor
it
was
an
instructive
sight
an
to
those
who
hold
that
optimism
has
died
out
of
the
race
i
had
never
seen
him
catch
a
fish
he
never
looked
to
me
as
if
he
were
at
all
likely
to
catch
a
fish
yet
he
persevered
there
are
few
things
more
restful
than
to
watch
some
one
else
busy
under
a
warm
sun
as
i
sat
there
my
pipe
drawing
nicely
as
the
result
of
certain
explorations
conducted
that
morning
with
a
straw
my
mind
ranged
idly
over
large
subjects
and
small
i
thought
of
love
and
i
mused
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
the
deplorable
speed
at
which
two
ounces
of
tobacco
disappeared
in
the
end
i
always
returned
to
the
professor
sitting
as
i
did
with
my
back
to
the
beach
i
could
see
nothing
but
his
boat
it
had
the
ocean
to
itself
i
began
to
ponder
over
the
professor
i
wondered
dreamily
if
he
were
very
hot
i
tried
to
picture
his
boyhood
i
speculated
on
his
future
and
the
pleasure
he
extracted
from
life
it
was
only
when
i
heard
him
call
out
to
hawk
to
be
careful
when
a
movement
on
the
part
of
that
oarsman
set
the
boat
rocking
that
i
began
to
weave
romances
round
him
in
which
i
myself
figured
but
once
started
i
progressed
rapidly
i
imagined
a
sudden
upset
professor
struggling
in
water
myself
heroically
courage
coming
a
few
rapid
strokes
saved
sequel
a
subdued
professor
dripping
salt
water
and
tears
of
gratitude
urging
me
to
become
his
that
sort
of
thing
happened
in
fiction
it
was
a
shame
that
it
should
not
happen
in
real
life
in
my
hot
youth
i
once
had
seven
stories
in
seven
weekly
penny
papers
in
the
same
month
all
dealing
with
a
situation
of
the
kind
only
the
details
differed
in
not
really
a
coward
vincent
devereux
had
rescued
the
earl
daughter
from
a
fire
whereas
in
hilda
hero
it
was
the
peppery
old
father
whom
tom
slingsby
saved
singularly
enough
from
drowning
in
other
words
i
a
very
mediocre
scribbler
had
effected
seven
times
in
a
single
month
what
the
powers
of
the
universe
could
not
manage
once
even
on
the
smallest
scale
it
was
precisely
three
minutes
to
twelve
i
had
just
consulted
my
watch
that
the
great
idea
surged
into
my
brain
at
four
minutes
to
twelve
i
had
been
grumbling
impotently
at
providence
by
two
minutes
to
twelve
i
had
determined
upon
a
manly
and
independent
course
of
action
briefly
it
was
this
providence
had
failed
to
give
satisfaction
i
would
therefore
cease
any
connection
with
it
and
start
a
rival
business
on
my
own
account
after
all
if
you
want
a
thing
done
well
you
must
do
it
yourself
in
other
words
since
a
dramatic
accident
and
rescue
would
not
happen
of
its
own
accord
i
would
arrange
one
for
myself
hawk
looked
to
me
the
sort
of
man
who
would
do
anything
in
a
friendly
way
for
a
few
shillings
i
had
now
to
fight
it
out
with
conscience
i
quote
the
brief
report
which
subsequently
appeared
in
the
conscience
celestial
garnet
unattached
conscience
came
to
the
scratch
smiling
and
confident
led
off
lightly
with
a
statement
that
it
would
be
bad
for
a
man
of
the
professor
age
to
get
wet
garnet
countered
heavily
alluding
to
the
warmth
of
the
weather
and
the
fact
that
the
professor
habitually
enjoyed
a
bathe
every
day
much
sparring
conscience
not
quite
so
confident
and
apparently
afraid
to
come
to
close
quarters
with
this
man
time
called
with
little
damage
done
conscience
much
freshened
by
the
half
minute
rest
feinted
with
the
charge
of
deceitfulness
and
nearly
got
home
heavily
with
what
would
phyllis
say
if
she
knew
garnet
however
cleverly
with
but
she
wo
know
and
followed
up
the
advantage
with
a
damaging
besides
it
all
for
the
best
the
round
ended
with
a
brisk
rally
on
general
principles
garnet
crowding
in
a
lot
of
work
conscience
down
twice
and
only
saved
by
the
call
of
time
three
and
last
conscience
came
up
very
weak
and
with
garnet
as
strong
as
ever
it
was
plain
that
the
round
would
be
a
brief
one
this
proved
to
be
the
case
early
in
the
second
minute
garnet
with
all
fair
in
love
and
war
conscience
down
and
out
the
winner
left
the
ring
without
a
mark
i
rose
feeling
much
refreshed
that
afternoon
i
interviewed
hawk
in
the
of
the
net
and
mackerel
hawk
i
said
to
him
darkly
over
a
mystic
and
pot
of
ale
i
want
you
next
time
you
take
professor
derrick
out
fishing
here
i
glanced
round
to
make
sure
that
we
were
not
overheard
to
upset
him
his
astonished
face
rose
slowly
from
the
pot
of
ale
like
a
full
moon
what
i
do
that
for
he
gasped
five
shillings
i
hope
said
i
but
i
am
prepared
to
go
to
ten
he
gurgled
i
encored
his
pot
of
ale
he
kept
on
gurgling
i
argued
with
the
man
i
spoke
splendidly
i
was
eloquent
but
at
the
same
time
concise
my
choice
of
words
was
superb
i
crystallised
my
ideas
into
pithy
sentences
which
a
child
could
have
understood
and
at
the
end
of
he
had
grasped
the
salient
points
of
the
scheme
also
he
imagined
that
i
wished
the
professor
upset
by
way
of
a
practical
joke
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
this
was
the
type
of
humour
which
was
to
be
expected
from
a
gentleman
from
london
i
am
afraid
he
must
at
one
period
in
his
career
have
lived
at
one
of
those
at
which
trippers
congregate
he
did
not
seem
to
think
highly
of
the
londoner
i
let
it
rest
at
that
i
could
not
give
my
true
reason
and
this
served
as
well
as
any
at
the
last
moment
he
recollected
that
he
too
would
get
wet
when
the
accident
took
place
and
he
raised
the
price
to
a
sovereign
a
mercenary
man
it
is
painful
to
see
how
rapidly
the
old
simple
spirit
is
dying
out
of
our
rural
districts
twenty
years
ago
a
fisherman
would
have
been
charmed
to
do
a
little
job
like
that
for
a
screw
of
tobacco
chapter
xi
the
brave
preserver
i
could
have
wished
during
the
next
few
days
that
harry
attitude
towards
myself
had
not
been
so
unctuously
confidential
and
mysterious
it
was
unnecessary
in
my
opinion
for
him
to
grin
meaningly
when
he
met
me
in
the
street
his
sly
wink
when
we
passed
each
other
on
the
cob
struck
me
as
in
indifferent
taste
the
thing
had
been
definitely
arranged
ten
shillings
down
and
ten
when
it
was
over
and
there
was
no
need
for
any
cloak
and
effects
i
objected
strongly
to
being
treated
as
the
villain
of
a
melodrama
i
was
merely
an
ordinary
man
forced
by
circumstances
into
doing
the
work
of
providence
hawk
demeanour
seemed
to
say
we
are
two
reckless
scoundrels
but
bless
you
wo
give
away
your
guilty
secret
the
climax
came
one
morning
as
i
was
going
along
the
street
towards
the
beach
i
was
passing
a
dark
doorway
when
out
shimmered
hawk
as
if
he
had
been
a
spectre
instead
of
the
most
substantial
man
within
a
radius
of
ten
miles
he
whispered
now
look
here
hawk
i
said
wrathfully
for
the
start
he
had
given
me
had
made
me
bite
my
tongue
this
has
got
to
stop
i
refuse
to
be
haunted
in
this
way
what
is
it
now
derrick
goes
out
this
morning
zur
thank
goodness
for
that
i
said
get
it
over
this
morning
then
without
fail
i
could
stand
another
day
of
it
i
went
on
to
the
cob
where
i
sat
down
i
was
excited
deeds
of
great
import
must
shortly
be
done
i
felt
a
little
nervous
it
would
never
do
to
bungle
the
thing
suppose
by
some
accident
i
were
to
drown
the
professor
or
suppose
that
after
all
he
contented
himself
with
a
mere
formal
expression
of
thanks
and
refused
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
these
things
did
not
bear
thinking
of
i
got
up
and
began
to
pace
restlessly
to
and
fro
presently
from
the
farther
end
of
the
harbour
there
put
off
boat
bearing
its
precious
cargo
my
mouth
became
dry
with
excitement
very
slowly
hawk
pulled
round
the
end
of
the
cob
coming
to
a
standstill
some
dozen
yards
from
where
i
was
performing
my
beat
it
was
evidently
here
that
the
scene
of
the
gallant
rescue
had
been
fixed
my
eyes
were
glued
upon
hawk
broad
back
only
when
going
in
to
bat
at
cricket
have
i
experienced
a
similar
feeling
of
suspense
the
boat
lay
almost
motionless
on
the
water
i
had
never
seen
the
sea
smoother
little
ripples
plashed
against
the
side
of
the
cob
it
seemed
as
if
this
perfect
calm
might
continue
for
ever
hawk
made
no
movement
then
suddenly
the
whole
scene
changed
to
one
of
vast
activity
i
heard
hawk
utter
a
hoarse
cry
and
saw
him
plunge
violently
in
his
seat
the
professor
turned
half
round
and
i
caught
sight
of
his
indignant
face
pink
with
emotion
then
the
scene
changed
again
with
the
rapidity
of
a
dissolving
view
i
saw
hawk
give
another
plunge
and
the
next
moment
the
boat
was
upside
down
in
the
water
and
i
was
shooting
headforemost
to
the
bottom
oppressed
with
the
indescribably
clammy
sensation
which
comes
when
one
clothes
are
thoroughly
wet
i
rose
to
the
surface
close
to
the
upturned
boat
the
first
sight
i
saw
was
the
spluttering
face
of
hawk
i
ignored
him
and
swam
to
where
the
professor
head
bobbed
on
the
waters
keep
cool
i
said
a
silly
remark
in
the
circumstances
he
was
swimming
energetically
but
unskilfully
he
appeared
to
be
one
of
those
men
who
can
look
after
themselves
in
the
water
only
when
they
are
in
bathing
costume
in
his
shore
clothes
it
would
have
taken
him
a
week
to
struggle
to
land
if
he
had
got
there
at
all
which
was
unlikely
i
know
all
about
saving
people
from
drowning
we
used
to
practise
it
with
a
dummy
in
the
at
school
i
attacked
him
from
the
rear
and
got
a
good
grip
of
him
by
the
shoulders
i
then
swam
on
my
back
in
the
direction
of
land
and
beached
him
with
much
at
the
feet
of
an
admiring
crowd
i
had
thought
of
putting
him
under
once
or
twice
just
to
show
him
he
was
being
rescued
but
decided
against
such
a
course
as
needlessly
realistic
as
it
was
i
fancy
he
had
swallowed
of
two
or
three
hearty
draughts
the
crowd
was
enthusiastic
brave
young
feller
said
somebody
i
blushed
this
was
fame
jumped
in
he
did
sure
enough
an
saved
the
gentleman
be
the
old
soul
drownded
that
girt
fule
i
was
sorry
for
hawk
popular
opinion
was
against
him
what
the
professor
said
of
him
when
he
recovered
his
breath
i
can
not
repeat
not
because
i
do
not
remember
it
but
because
there
is
a
line
and
one
must
draw
it
let
it
be
sufficient
to
say
that
on
the
subject
of
hawk
he
saw
eye
to
eye
with
the
citizen
who
had
described
him
as
a
girt
fule
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
my
fellow
conspirator
did
well
to
keep
out
of
it
all
he
was
now
sitting
in
the
boat
which
he
had
restored
to
its
normal
position
baling
pensively
with
an
old
tin
can
to
satire
from
the
shore
he
paid
no
attention
the
professor
stood
up
and
stretched
out
his
hand
i
grasped
it
garnet
he
said
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
had
been
the
father
of
the
heroine
of
hilda
hero
we
parted
recently
in
anger
let
me
thank
you
for
your
gallant
conduct
and
hope
that
bygones
will
be
bygones
i
came
out
strong
i
continued
to
hold
his
hand
the
crowd
raised
a
sympathetic
cheer
i
said
professor
the
fault
was
mine
show
that
you
have
forgiven
me
by
coming
up
to
the
farm
and
putting
on
something
dry
an
excellent
idea
me
boy
i
a
little
wet
a
little
i
agreed
we
walked
briskly
up
the
hill
to
the
farm
ukridge
met
us
at
the
gate
he
diagnosed
the
situation
rapidly
you
all
wet
he
said
i
admitted
it
professor
derrick
has
had
an
unfortunate
boating
accident
i
explained
and
garnet
heroically
dived
in
in
all
his
clothes
and
saved
me
life
broke
in
the
professor
a
hero
sir
a
you
catching
cold
old
horse
said
ukridge
all
friendliness
and
concern
his
little
differences
with
the
professor
having
vanished
like
thawed
snow
this
never
do
come
upstairs
and
get
into
something
of
garnet
my
own
toggery
would
fit
what
come
along
come
along
i
get
you
some
hot
water
beale
we
want
a
large
can
of
hot
water
at
once
what
yes
immediately
what
very
well
then
as
soon
as
you
can
now
then
garny
my
boy
out
with
the
duds
what
do
you
think
of
this
now
professor
a
sweetly
pretty
thing
in
grey
flannel
here
a
shirt
get
out
of
that
wet
toggery
and
beale
shall
dry
it
do
attempt
to
tell
me
about
it
till
changed
socks
socks
forward
show
socks
here
you
are
coat
try
this
blazer
that
right
that
right
he
bustled
about
till
the
professor
was
clothed
then
marched
him
downstairs
and
gave
him
a
cigar
now
what
all
this
what
happened
the
professor
explained
he
was
severe
in
his
narration
upon
the
unlucky
hawk
i
was
fishing
ukridge
with
me
back
turned
when
i
felt
the
boat
rock
violently
from
one
side
to
the
other
to
such
an
extent
that
i
nearly
lost
me
equilibrium
and
then
the
boat
upset
the
man
a
fool
sir
i
could
not
see
what
had
happened
my
back
being
turned
as
i
say
garnet
must
have
seen
what
happened
old
horse
it
was
very
sudden
i
said
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
man
had
got
an
attack
of
cramp
that
would
account
for
it
he
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
most
sober
and
trustworthy
fellow
never
trust
that
sort
of
man
said
ukridge
they
are
always
the
worst
it
plain
to
me
that
this
man
was
beastly
drunk
and
upset
the
boat
while
trying
to
do
a
dance
a
great
curse
drink
said
the
professor
why
yes
ukridge
i
think
i
will
thank
you
thank
you
that
will
be
enough
not
all
the
soda
if
you
please
ah
this
tastes
pleasanter
than
salt
water
garnet
eh
eh
ha
ha
he
was
in
the
best
of
tempers
and
i
worked
strenuously
to
keep
him
so
my
scheme
had
been
so
successful
that
its
iniquity
did
not
worry
me
i
have
noticed
that
this
is
usually
the
case
in
matters
of
this
kind
it
is
the
bungled
crime
that
brings
remorse
we
must
go
round
the
links
together
one
of
these
days
garnet
said
the
professor
i
have
noticed
you
there
on
several
occasions
playing
a
strong
game
i
have
lately
taken
to
using
a
wooden
putter
it
is
wonderful
what
a
difference
it
makes
golf
is
a
great
bond
of
union
we
wandered
about
the
grounds
discussing
the
game
the
growing
more
firmly
established
every
moment
we
must
certainly
arrange
a
meeting
concluded
the
professor
i
shall
be
interested
to
see
how
we
stand
with
regard
to
one
another
i
have
improved
my
game
considerably
since
i
have
been
down
here
considerably
my
only
feat
worthy
of
mention
since
i
started
the
game
i
said
has
been
to
halve
a
round
with
angus
at
st
andrews
asked
the
professor
impressed
yes
but
it
was
one
of
his
very
off
days
i
fancy
he
must
have
had
gout
or
something
and
i
have
certainly
never
played
so
well
since
still
said
the
professor
yes
we
must
really
arrange
to
meet
with
ukridge
who
was
in
one
of
his
less
tactless
moods
he
became
very
friendly
ukridge
ready
agreement
with
his
strictures
on
the
erring
hawk
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
this
when
a
man
has
a
grievance
he
feels
drawn
to
those
who
will
hear
him
patiently
and
sympathise
ukridge
was
all
sympathy
the
man
is
an
unprincipled
scoundrel
he
said
and
should
be
torn
limb
from
limb
take
my
advice
and
do
go
out
with
him
again
show
him
that
you
are
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
the
spilt
child
dreads
the
water
what
human
life
is
safe
with
such
men
as
hawk
roaming
about
you
are
perfectly
right
sir
the
man
can
have
no
defence
i
shall
not
employ
him
again
i
felt
more
than
a
little
guilty
while
listening
to
this
duet
on
the
subject
of
the
man
whom
i
had
lured
from
the
straight
and
narrow
path
but
the
professor
would
listen
to
no
defence
my
attempts
at
excusing
him
were
ill
received
indeed
the
professor
shewed
such
signs
of
becoming
heated
that
i
abandoned
my
to
his
fate
with
extreme
promptness
after
all
an
addition
to
the
stipulated
reward
one
of
these
days
would
compensate
him
for
any
loss
which
he
might
sustain
from
the
withdrawal
of
the
professor
custom
harry
hawk
was
in
good
enough
case
i
would
see
that
he
did
not
suffer
filled
with
these
philanthropic
feelings
i
turned
once
more
to
talk
with
the
professor
of
niblicks
and
approach
shots
and
holes
done
in
three
without
a
brassy
we
were
a
merry
party
at
lunch
a
lunch
fortunately
in
beale
best
vein
consisting
of
a
roast
chicken
and
sweets
chicken
had
figured
somewhat
frequently
of
late
on
our
daily
bill
of
fare
we
saw
the
professor
off
the
premises
in
his
dried
clothes
and
i
turned
back
to
put
the
fowls
to
bed
in
a
happier
frame
of
mind
than
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
i
whistled
airs
as
i
worked
rum
old
buffer
said
ukridge
meditatively
pouring
himself
out
another
whisky
and
soda
my
goodness
i
should
have
liked
to
have
seen
him
in
the
water
why
do
i
miss
these
good
things
chapter
xii
some
emotions
and
yellow
lupin
the
fame
which
came
to
me
through
that
gallant
rescue
was
a
little
embarrassing
i
was
a
marked
man
did
i
walk
through
the
village
heads
emerged
from
windows
and
eyes
followed
me
out
of
sight
did
i
sit
on
the
beach
groups
formed
behind
me
and
watched
in
silent
admiration
i
was
the
man
of
the
moment
if
we
wanted
an
advertisement
for
the
farm
said
ukridge
on
one
of
these
occasions
we
could
have
had
a
better
one
than
you
garny
my
boy
you
have
brought
us
three
distinct
orders
for
eggs
during
the
last
week
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
we
need
all
the
orders
we
can
get
that
bring
us
in
ready
money
the
farm
is
in
a
critical
condition
the
coffers
are
low
deuced
low
and
i
tell
you
another
thing
getting
precious
tired
of
living
on
nothing
but
chicken
and
eggs
millie
though
she
does
say
so
so
am
i
i
said
and
i
do
feel
like
imitating
your
wife
proud
reserve
i
never
want
to
see
a
chicken
again
as
for
eggs
they
are
far
too
much
for
us
for
the
last
week
monotony
had
been
the
keynote
of
our
commissariat
we
had
had
cold
chicken
and
eggs
for
breakfast
boiled
chicken
and
eggs
for
lunch
and
roast
chicken
and
eggs
for
dinner
meals
became
a
nuisance
and
beale
complained
bitterly
that
we
did
not
give
her
a
chance
she
was
a
cook
who
would
have
graced
an
alderman
house
and
served
up
noble
dinners
for
gourmets
and
here
she
was
in
this
remote
corner
of
the
world
ringing
the
changes
on
boiled
chicken
and
roast
chicken
and
boiled
eggs
and
poached
eggs
whistler
set
to
paint
for
might
have
felt
the
same
restless
discontent
as
for
her
husband
the
hired
retainer
he
took
life
as
tranquilly
as
ever
and
seemed
to
regard
the
whole
thing
as
the
most
exhilarating
farce
he
had
ever
been
in
i
think
he
looked
on
ukridge
as
an
amiable
lunatic
and
was
content
to
rough
it
a
little
in
order
to
enjoy
the
privilege
of
observing
his
movements
he
made
no
complaints
of
the
food
when
a
man
has
supported
life
for
a
number
of
years
on
incessant
army
beef
the
monotony
of
daily
chicken
and
eggs
scarcely
strikes
him
the
fact
is
said
ukridge
these
tradesmen
round
here
seem
to
be
a
sordid
suspicious
lot
they
clamour
for
money
he
mentioned
a
few
examples
vickers
the
butcher
had
been
the
first
to
strike
with
the
remark
that
he
would
like
to
see
the
colour
of
ukridge
money
before
supplying
further
joints
dawlish
the
grocer
had
expressed
almost
exactly
similar
sentiments
two
days
later
and
the
ranks
of
these
passive
resisters
had
been
receiving
fresh
recruits
ever
since
to
a
man
the
tradesmen
of
combe
regis
seemed
as
deficient
in
simple
faith
as
they
were
in
norman
blood
ca
you
pay
some
of
them
a
little
on
account
i
suggested
it
would
set
them
going
again
my
dear
old
man
said
ukridge
impressively
we
need
every
penny
of
ready
money
we
can
raise
for
the
farm
the
place
simply
eats
money
that
infernal
roop
let
us
in
for
i
do
know
what
that
insidious
epidemic
had
indeed
proved
costly
we
had
painted
the
throats
of
the
chickens
with
the
best
turpentine
at
least
ukridge
and
beale
had
but
in
spite
of
their
efforts
dozens
had
died
and
we
had
been
obliged
to
sink
much
more
money
than
was
pleasant
in
restocking
the
run
the
battle
which
took
place
on
the
first
day
after
the
election
of
the
new
members
was
a
sight
to
remember
the
results
of
it
were
still
noticeable
in
the
depressed
aspect
of
certain
of
the
recently
enrolled
no
said
ukridge
summing
up
these
men
must
wait
we
ca
help
their
troubles
why
good
gracious
it
is
as
if
they
been
waiting
for
the
money
long
we
not
been
down
here
much
over
a
month
i
never
heard
of
such
a
scandalous
thing
my
word
i
a
good
mind
to
go
round
and
have
a
straight
talk
with
one
or
two
of
them
i
come
and
settle
down
here
and
stimulate
trade
and
give
them
large
orders
and
they
worry
me
with
bills
when
they
know
i
up
to
my
eyes
in
work
looking
after
the
fowls
one
ca
attend
to
everything
the
business
is
just
now
at
its
most
crucial
point
it
would
be
fatal
to
pay
any
attention
to
anything
else
with
things
as
they
are
these
scoundrels
will
get
paid
all
in
good
time
it
is
a
peculiarity
of
situations
of
this
kind
that
the
ideas
of
debtor
and
creditor
as
to
what
constitutes
a
good
time
never
coincide
i
am
afraid
that
despite
the
urgent
need
for
strict
attention
to
business
i
was
inclined
to
neglect
my
duties
about
this
time
i
had
got
into
the
habit
of
wandering
off
either
to
the
links
where
i
generally
found
the
professor
sometimes
phyllis
or
on
long
walks
by
myself
there
was
one
particular
walk
along
the
cliffs
through
some
of
the
most
beautiful
scenery
i
have
ever
set
eyes
on
which
more
than
any
other
suited
my
mood
i
would
work
my
way
through
the
woods
till
i
came
to
a
small
clearing
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
there
i
would
sit
and
smoke
by
the
hour
if
ever
i
am
stricken
with
smoker
heart
or
staggers
or
tobacco
amblyopia
or
any
other
of
the
cheery
things
which
doctors
predict
for
the
devotee
of
the
weed
i
shall
feel
that
i
sowed
the
seeds
of
it
that
summer
in
that
little
clearing
overlooking
the
sea
a
man
in
love
needs
much
tobacco
a
man
thinking
out
a
novel
needs
much
tobacco
i
was
in
the
grip
of
both
maladies
somehow
i
found
that
my
ideas
flowed
more
readily
in
that
spot
than
in
any
other
i
had
not
been
inside
the
professor
grounds
since
the
occasion
when
i
had
gone
in
through
the
hedge
but
on
the
afternoon
following
my
financial
conversation
with
ukridge
i
made
my
way
thither
after
a
toilet
which
from
its
length
should
have
produced
better
results
than
it
did
not
for
four
whole
days
had
i
caught
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
phyllis
i
had
been
to
the
links
three
times
and
had
met
the
professor
twice
but
on
both
occasions
she
had
been
absent
i
had
not
had
the
courage
to
ask
after
her
i
had
an
absurd
idea
that
my
voice
or
my
manner
would
betray
me
in
some
way
i
felt
that
i
should
have
put
the
question
with
such
an
exaggerated
show
of
indifference
that
all
would
have
been
discovered
the
professor
was
not
at
home
nor
was
chase
nor
was
miss
norah
derrick
the
lady
i
had
met
on
the
beach
with
the
professor
miss
phyllis
said
the
maid
was
in
the
garden
i
went
into
the
garden
she
was
sitting
under
the
cedar
by
the
reading
she
looked
up
as
i
approached
i
said
it
was
a
lovely
afternoon
after
which
there
was
a
lull
in
the
conversation
i
was
filled
with
a
horrid
fear
that
i
was
boring
her
i
had
probably
arrived
at
the
very
moment
when
she
was
most
interested
in
her
book
she
must
i
thought
even
now
be
regarding
me
as
a
nuisance
and
was
probably
rehearsing
bitter
things
to
say
to
the
maid
for
not
having
had
the
sense
to
explain
that
she
was
out
i
er
called
in
the
hope
of
seeing
professor
derrick
i
said
you
would
find
him
on
the
links
she
replied
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
spoke
wistfully
oh
it
it
does
matter
i
said
it
was
anything
important
this
was
true
if
the
professor
had
appeared
then
and
there
i
should
have
found
it
difficult
to
think
of
anything
to
say
to
him
which
would
have
accounted
to
any
extent
for
my
anxiety
to
see
him
how
are
the
chickens
mr
garnet
said
she
the
situation
was
saved
conversationally
i
am
like
a
clockwork
toy
i
have
to
be
set
going
on
the
affairs
of
the
farm
i
could
speak
fluently
i
sketched
for
her
the
progress
we
had
made
since
her
visit
i
was
humorous
concerning
roop
epigrammatic
on
the
subject
of
the
hired
retainer
and
edwin
then
the
cat
did
come
down
from
the
chimney
said
phyllis
we
both
laughed
and
i
can
answer
for
myself
i
felt
the
better
for
it
he
came
down
next
day
i
said
and
made
an
excellent
lunch
of
one
of
our
best
fowls
he
also
killed
another
and
only
just
escaped
death
himself
at
the
hands
of
ukridge
ukridge
does
like
him
does
he
if
he
does
he
dissembles
his
love
edwin
is
ukridge
pet
he
is
the
only
subject
on
which
they
disagree
edwin
is
certainly
in
the
way
on
a
chicken
farm
he
has
got
over
his
fear
of
bob
and
is
now
perfectly
lawless
we
have
to
keep
a
steady
eye
on
him
and
have
you
had
any
success
with
the
incubator
i
love
incubators
i
have
always
wanted
to
have
one
of
my
own
but
we
have
never
kept
fowls
the
incubator
has
not
done
all
that
it
should
have
done
i
said
ukridge
looks
after
it
and
i
fancy
his
methods
are
not
the
right
methods
i
do
know
if
i
have
got
the
figures
absolutely
correct
but
ukridge
reasons
on
these
lines
he
says
you
are
supposed
to
keep
the
temperature
up
to
a
hundred
and
five
degrees
i
think
he
said
a
hundred
and
five
then
the
eggs
are
supposed
to
hatch
out
in
a
week
or
so
he
argues
that
you
may
just
as
well
keep
the
temperature
at
and
wait
a
fortnight
for
your
chickens
i
am
certain
there
a
fallacy
in
the
system
somewhere
because
we
never
seem
to
get
as
far
as
the
chickens
but
ukridge
says
his
theory
is
mathematically
sound
and
he
sticks
to
it
are
you
quite
sure
that
the
way
you
are
doing
it
is
the
best
way
to
manage
a
chicken
farm
i
should
very
much
doubt
it
i
am
a
child
in
these
matters
i
had
only
seen
a
chicken
in
its
wild
state
once
or
twice
before
we
came
down
here
i
had
never
dreamed
of
being
an
active
assistant
on
a
real
farm
the
whole
thing
began
like
george
ade
fable
of
the
author
an
author
myself
was
sitting
at
his
desk
trying
to
turn
out
any
old
thing
that
could
be
converted
into
when
a
friend
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
table
and
told
him
to
go
right
on
and
not
mind
him
did
ukridge
do
that
very
nearly
that
he
called
at
my
rooms
one
beautiful
morning
when
i
was
feeling
desperately
tired
of
london
and
overworked
and
dying
for
a
holiday
and
suggested
that
i
should
come
to
combe
regis
with
him
and
help
him
farm
chickens
i
have
not
regretted
it
it
is
a
lovely
place
is
it
the
loveliest
i
have
ever
seen
how
charming
your
garden
is
shall
we
go
and
look
at
it
you
have
not
seen
the
whole
of
it
as
she
rose
i
saw
her
book
which
she
had
laid
face
downwards
on
the
grass
beside
her
it
was
the
same
copy
of
the
manoeuvres
of
arthur
i
was
thrilled
this
patient
perseverance
must
surely
mean
something
she
saw
me
looking
at
it
did
you
draw
pamela
from
anybody
she
asked
suddenly
i
was
glad
now
that
i
had
not
done
so
the
wretched
pamela
once
my
pride
was
for
some
reason
unpopular
with
the
only
critic
about
whose
opinion
i
cared
and
had
fallen
accordingly
from
her
pedestal
as
we
wandered
down
from
the
garden
paths
she
gave
me
her
opinion
of
the
book
in
the
main
it
was
appreciative
i
shall
always
associate
the
scent
of
yellow
lupin
with
the
higher
criticism
of
course
i
do
know
anything
about
writing
books
she
said
yes
my
tone
implied
or
i
hope
it
did
that
she
was
an
expert
on
books
and
that
if
she
was
not
it
did
matter
but
i
do
think
you
do
your
heroines
well
i
have
just
got
outsider
my
other
novel
bastable
kirby
satirical
all
about
society
of
which
i
know
less
than
i
know
about
slated
by
and
well
received
by
and
and
continued
phyllis
lady
maud
is
exactly
the
same
as
pamela
in
the
of
arthur
i
thought
you
must
have
drawn
both
characters
from
some
one
you
knew
no
i
said
no
purely
imaginary
i
am
so
glad
said
phyllis
and
then
neither
of
us
seemed
to
have
anything
to
say
my
knees
began
to
tremble
i
realised
that
the
moment
had
arrived
when
my
fate
must
be
put
to
the
touch
and
i
feared
that
the
moment
was
premature
we
can
not
arrange
these
things
to
suit
ourselves
i
knew
that
the
time
was
not
yet
ripe
but
the
magic
scent
of
the
yellow
lupin
was
too
much
for
me
miss
derrick
i
said
hoarsely
phyllis
was
looking
with
more
intentness
than
the
attractions
of
the
flower
justified
at
a
rose
she
held
in
her
hand
the
bee
hummed
in
the
lupin
miss
derrick
i
said
and
stopped
again
i
say
you
people
said
a
cheerful
voice
tea
is
ready
hullo
garnet
how
are
you
that
medal
arrived
yet
from
the
humane
society
i
spun
round
tom
chase
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
path
the
only
word
that
could
deal
adequately
with
the
situation
slapped
against
my
front
teeth
i
grinned
a
sickly
grin
well
tom
said
phyllis
and
there
was
i
thought
just
the
faintest
tinkle
of
annoyance
in
her
voice
i
been
bathing
said
chase
propos
des
oh
i
replied
and
i
wish
i
added
that
you
drowned
yourself
but
i
added
it
silently
to
myself
chapter
xiii
tea
and
tennis
met
the
professor
late
boatman
on
the
cob
said
chase
dissecting
a
chocolate
cake
clumsy
man
said
phyllis
i
hope
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
i
shall
never
forgive
him
for
trying
to
drown
papa
my
heart
bled
for
henry
hawk
that
modern
martyr
when
i
met
him
said
tom
chase
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
trying
to
drown
his
sorrow
as
well
i
knew
he
drank
said
phyllis
severely
the
very
first
time
i
saw
him
you
might
have
warned
the
professor
murmured
chase
he
could
have
upset
the
boat
if
he
had
been
sober
you
never
know
he
may
have
done
it
on
purpose
tom
how
absurd
rather
rough
on
the
man
are
you
i
said
merely
a
suggestion
continued
chase
airily
i
been
reading
sensational
novels
lately
and
it
seems
to
me
that
hawk
cut
out
to
be
a
minion
probably
some
secret
foe
of
the
professor
bribed
him
my
heart
stood
still
did
he
know
i
wondered
and
was
this
all
a
roundabout
way
of
telling
me
he
knew
the
professor
may
be
a
member
of
an
anarchist
league
or
something
and
this
is
his
punishment
for
refusing
to
assassinate
some
sportsman
have
another
cup
of
tea
tom
and
stop
talking
nonsense
chase
handed
in
his
cup
what
gave
me
the
idea
that
the
upset
was
done
on
purpose
was
this
i
saw
the
whole
thing
from
the
ware
cliff
the
spill
looked
to
me
just
like
dozens
i
had
seen
at
malta
why
do
they
upset
themselves
on
purpose
at
malta
particularly
inquired
phyllis
listen
carefully
my
dear
and
you
know
more
about
the
ways
of
the
navy
that
guards
your
coasts
than
you
did
before
when
men
are
allowed
on
shore
at
malta
the
owner
has
a
fancy
to
see
them
snugly
on
board
again
at
a
certain
reasonable
hour
after
that
hour
any
maltese
policeman
who
brings
them
aboard
gets
one
sovereign
cash
but
he
has
to
do
all
the
bringing
part
of
it
on
his
own
consequence
is
you
see
boats
rowing
out
to
the
ship
carrying
men
who
have
overstayed
their
leave
and
when
they
get
near
enough
the
gentleman
in
custody
jumps
to
his
feet
upsets
the
boat
and
swims
for
the
gangway
the
policemen
if
they
are
drowned
they
sometimes
are
race
him
and
whichever
gets
there
first
wins
if
it
the
policeman
he
gets
his
sovereign
if
it
the
sailor
he
is
considered
to
have
arrived
not
in
a
state
of
custody
and
gets
off
easier
what
a
judicious
remark
that
was
of
the
governor
of
north
carolina
to
the
governor
of
south
carolina
respecting
the
length
of
time
between
drinks
just
one
more
cup
please
phyllis
but
how
does
all
that
apply
i
asked
hawk
upset
the
professor
just
as
those
maltese
were
upset
a
patent
way
of
doing
it
furthermore
by
judicious
questioning
i
found
that
hawk
was
once
in
the
navy
and
stationed
at
malta
who
going
to
drag
in
sherlock
holmes
you
do
really
think
i
said
feeling
like
a
criminal
in
the
dock
when
the
case
is
going
against
him
i
think
friend
hawk
has
been
the
joys
of
his
vanished
youth
so
to
speak
he
ought
to
be
prosecuted
said
phyllis
blazing
with
indignation
alas
poor
hawk
nobody
safe
with
a
man
of
that
sort
hiring
out
a
boat
oh
miserable
hawk
but
why
on
earth
should
he
play
a
trick
like
that
on
professor
derrick
chase
pure
animal
spirits
probably
or
he
may
as
i
say
be
a
minion
i
was
hot
all
over
i
shall
tell
father
that
said
phyllis
in
her
most
decided
voice
and
see
what
he
says
i
do
wonder
at
the
man
taking
to
drink
after
doing
such
a
thing
i
i
think
you
making
a
mistake
i
said
i
never
make
mistakes
chase
replied
i
am
called
archibald
the
for
i
am
infallible
i
propose
to
keep
a
reflective
eye
upon
the
jovial
hawk
he
helped
himself
to
another
section
of
the
chocolate
cake
have
you
finished
tom
inquired
phyllis
i
sure
garnet
getting
tired
of
sitting
talking
here
she
said
i
shot
out
a
polite
negative
chase
explained
with
his
mouth
full
that
he
had
by
no
means
finished
chocolate
cake
it
appeared
was
the
dream
of
his
life
when
at
sea
he
was
accustomed
to
lie
awake
o
nights
thinking
of
it
you
do
seem
to
realise
he
said
that
i
have
just
come
from
a
cruise
on
a
there
was
such
a
sea
on
as
a
rule
that
cooking
operations
were
entirely
suspended
and
we
lived
on
ham
and
sardines
without
bread
how
horrible
on
the
other
hand
added
chase
philosophically
it
did
matter
much
because
we
were
all
ill
most
of
the
time
do
be
nasty
tom
i
was
merely
defending
myself
i
hope
hawk
will
be
able
to
do
as
well
when
his
turn
comes
my
aim
my
dear
phyllis
is
to
show
you
in
a
series
of
impressionist
pictures
the
sort
of
thing
i
have
to
go
through
when
i
not
here
then
perhaps
you
wo
rend
me
so
savagely
over
a
matter
of
five
minutes
lateness
for
breakfast
five
minutes
it
was
of
an
hour
and
everything
was
simply
frozen
quite
right
too
in
weather
like
this
you
a
slave
to
convention
phyllis
you
think
breakfast
ought
to
be
hot
so
you
always
have
it
hot
on
occasion
i
prefer
mine
cold
mine
is
the
truer
wisdom
you
can
give
the
cook
my
compliments
phyllis
and
tell
her
gently
for
i
do
wish
the
glad
news
to
overwhelm
her
that
i
enjoyed
that
cake
say
that
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
her
again
care
for
a
game
of
tennis
garnet
what
a
pity
norah
is
here
said
phyllis
we
could
have
had
a
four
but
she
is
at
present
wasting
her
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
of
yeovil
you
had
better
sit
down
and
watch
us
phyllis
tennis
in
this
sort
of
weather
is
no
job
for
the
feminine
i
will
explain
the
finer
points
of
my
play
as
we
go
on
look
out
particularly
for
the
tilden
slosh
a
winner
every
time
we
proceeded
to
the
tennis
court
i
played
with
the
sun
in
my
eyes
i
might
if
i
chose
emphasise
that
fact
and
attribute
my
subsequent
rout
to
it
adding
by
way
of
solidifying
the
excuse
that
i
was
playing
in
a
strange
court
with
a
borrowed
racquet
and
that
my
mind
was
preoccupied
firstly
with
hawk
secondly
and
chiefly
with
the
gloomy
thought
that
phyllis
and
my
opponent
seemed
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
each
other
their
manner
at
tea
had
been
almost
that
of
an
engaged
couple
there
was
a
thorough
understanding
between
them
i
will
not
however
take
refuge
behind
excuses
i
admit
without
qualifying
the
statement
that
chase
was
too
good
for
me
i
had
always
been
under
the
impression
that
lieutenants
in
the
royal
navy
were
not
brilliant
at
tennis
i
had
met
them
at
various
houses
but
they
had
never
shone
conspicuously
they
had
played
an
earnest
unobtrusive
game
and
generally
seemed
glad
when
it
was
over
chase
was
not
of
this
sort
his
service
was
bottled
lightning
his
returns
behaved
like
jumping
crackers
he
won
the
first
game
in
precisely
six
strokes
he
served
only
once
did
i
take
the
service
with
the
full
face
of
the
racquet
and
then
i
seemed
to
be
stopping
a
bullet
i
returned
it
into
the
net
the
last
of
the
series
struck
the
wooden
edge
of
my
racquet
and
soared
over
the
back
net
into
the
shrubbery
after
the
manner
of
a
snick
to
long
slip
off
a
fast
bowler
game
said
chase
we
look
for
that
afterwards
i
felt
a
worm
and
no
man
phyllis
i
thought
would
probably
judge
my
entire
character
from
this
exhibition
a
man
she
would
reflect
who
could
be
so
feeble
and
miserable
a
failure
at
tennis
could
not
be
good
for
much
in
any
department
of
life
she
would
compare
me
instinctively
with
my
opponent
and
contrast
his
dash
and
brilliance
with
my
own
inefficiency
somehow
the
massacre
was
beginning
to
have
a
bad
effect
on
my
character
all
my
was
ebbing
a
little
more
of
this
and
i
should
become
crushed
a
mere
human
jelly
it
was
my
turn
to
serve
service
is
my
strong
point
at
tennis
i
am
inaccurate
but
vigorous
and
occasionally
send
in
a
quite
unplayable
shot
one
or
two
of
these
even
at
the
expense
of
a
fault
or
so
and
i
might
be
permitted
to
retain
at
least
a
portion
of
my
i
opened
with
a
couple
of
faults
the
sight
of
phyllis
sitting
calm
and
cool
in
her
chair
under
the
cedar
unnerved
me
i
served
another
fault
and
yet
another
here
i
say
garnet
observed
chase
plaintively
do
put
me
out
of
this
hideous
suspense
i
becoming
a
mere
bundle
of
quivering
ganglions
i
loathe
facetiousness
in
moments
of
stress
i
frowned
austerely
made
no
reply
and
served
another
fault
my
fifth
matters
had
reached
a
crisis
even
if
i
had
to
lob
it
underhand
i
must
send
the
ball
over
the
net
with
the
next
stroke
i
restrained
myself
this
time
eschewing
the
careless
vigour
which
had
marked
my
previous
efforts
the
ball
flew
in
a
slow
semicircle
and
pitched
inside
the
correct
court
at
least
i
told
myself
i
had
not
served
a
fault
what
happened
then
i
can
not
exactly
say
i
saw
my
opponent
spring
forward
like
a
panther
and
whirl
his
racquet
the
next
moment
the
back
net
was
shaking
violently
and
the
ball
was
rolling
swiftly
along
the
ground
on
a
return
journey
to
the
other
court
said
chase
phyllis
yes
that
was
the
tilden
slosh
i
thought
it
must
be
said
phyllis
in
the
third
game
i
managed
to
score
fifteen
by
the
merest
chance
i
returned
one
of
his
serves
and
probably
through
surprise
he
failed
to
send
it
back
again
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
games
i
omitted
to
score
phyllis
had
left
the
cedar
now
and
was
picking
flowers
from
the
beds
behind
the
court
we
began
the
sixth
game
and
now
for
some
reason
i
played
really
well
i
struck
a
little
vein
of
brilliance
i
was
serving
and
this
time
a
proportion
of
my
serves
went
over
the
net
instead
of
trying
to
get
through
the
score
went
from
fifteen
all
to
hope
began
to
surge
through
my
veins
if
i
could
keep
this
up
i
might
win
yet
the
tilden
slosh
diminished
my
lead
by
fifteen
then
i
got
in
a
really
fine
serve
which
beat
him
in
another
slosh
deuce
another
slam
out
it
was
an
awesome
moment
there
is
a
tide
in
the
affairs
of
men
which
taken
by
the
flood
i
served
fault
i
served
again
a
beauty
he
returned
it
like
a
flash
into
the
corner
of
the
court
with
a
supreme
effort
i
got
to
it
we
rallied
i
was
playing
like
a
professor
then
whizz
the
slosh
had
beaten
me
on
the
post
game
said
chase
tossing
his
racquet
into
the
air
and
catching
it
by
the
handle
good
game
that
last
one
i
turned
to
see
what
phyllis
thought
of
it
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
had
shown
her
of
what
stuff
i
was
made
she
had
disappeared
looking
for
miss
derrick
said
chase
jumping
the
net
and
joining
me
in
my
court
she
gone
into
the
house
when
did
she
go
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
game
said
chase
gone
to
dress
for
dinner
i
suppose
he
continued
it
must
be
getting
late
i
think
i
ought
to
be
going
too
if
you
do
mind
the
professor
gets
a
little
restive
if
i
keep
him
waiting
for
his
daily
bread
great
scott
that
watch
ca
be
right
what
do
you
make
of
it
yes
so
do
i
really
think
i
must
run
you
wo
mind
then
see
you
i
hope
i
walked
slowly
out
across
the
fields
that
same
star
in
which
i
had
confided
on
a
former
occasion
was
at
its
post
it
looked
placid
and
cheerful
never
got
beaten
by
six
games
to
love
under
the
very
eyes
of
a
was
never
cut
out
ignominiously
by
infernally
capable
lieutenants
in
his
majesty
navy
no
wonder
it
was
cheerful
chapter
xiv
a
council
of
war
the
fact
is
said
ukridge
if
things
go
on
as
they
are
now
my
lad
we
shall
be
in
the
cart
this
business
wants
bucking
up
we
do
seem
to
be
making
headway
why
it
is
i
do
know
but
we
are
making
headway
of
course
what
we
want
is
time
if
only
these
scoundrels
of
tradesmen
would
leave
us
alone
for
a
spell
we
could
get
things
going
properly
but
we
hampered
and
rattled
and
worried
all
the
time
are
we
millie
yes
dear
you
do
let
me
see
the
financial
side
of
the
thing
enough
i
complained
why
do
you
keep
me
thoroughly
posted
i
did
know
we
were
in
such
a
bad
way
the
fowls
look
fit
enough
and
edwin
has
had
one
for
a
week
edwin
knows
as
well
as
possible
when
he
done
wrong
garnet
said
ukridge
he
was
so
sorry
after
he
had
killed
those
other
two
yes
said
ukridge
i
saw
to
that
as
far
as
i
can
see
i
continued
we
going
strong
chicken
for
breakfast
lunch
and
dinner
is
a
shade
monotonous
perhaps
but
look
at
the
business
we
doing
we
sold
a
whole
heap
of
eggs
last
week
but
not
enough
garny
old
man
we
are
making
our
presence
felt
england
is
ringing
with
our
name
we
sell
a
dozen
eggs
where
we
ought
to
be
selling
them
by
the
hundred
carting
them
off
in
trucks
for
the
london
market
and
congesting
the
traffic
harrod
and
and
the
rest
of
them
are
beginning
to
get
on
their
hind
legs
and
talk
that
what
they
doing
devilish
unpleasant
they
making
themselves
you
see
laddie
there
no
denying
it
we
touch
them
for
the
deuce
of
a
lot
of
things
on
account
and
they
agreed
to
take
it
out
in
eggs
all
they
done
so
far
is
to
take
it
out
in
apologetic
letters
from
millie
now
i
do
suppose
there
a
woman
alive
who
can
write
a
better
apologetic
letter
than
her
nibs
but
if
and
can
face
facts
you
ca
help
seeing
that
the
juiciest
apologetic
letter
is
not
an
egg
i
meant
to
say
look
at
it
from
their
point
of
view
harrod
or
whiteley
comes
into
his
store
in
the
morning
rubbing
his
hands
expectantly
he
says
many
eggs
from
combe
regis
and
instead
of
leading
him
off
to
a
corner
piled
up
with
bursting
crates
they
show
him
a
letter
telling
him
it
all
come
right
in
the
future
i
never
run
a
store
myself
but
i
should
think
that
would
jar
a
chap
anyhow
the
blighters
seem
to
be
getting
tired
of
waiting
the
last
letter
from
harrod
was
quite
pathetic
said
ukridge
sadly
i
had
a
vision
of
an
eggless
london
i
seemed
to
see
homes
rendered
desolate
and
lives
embittered
by
the
slump
and
millionaires
bidding
against
one
another
for
the
few
rare
specimens
which
ukridge
had
actually
managed
to
despatch
to
brompton
and
bayswater
ukridge
having
induced
himself
to
be
for
five
minutes
now
began
to
slip
back
to
his
own
personal
point
of
view
and
became
once
more
the
man
with
a
grievance
his
fleeting
sympathy
with
the
wrongs
of
harrod
and
whiteley
disappeared
what
it
all
amounts
to
he
said
complainingly
is
that
infernally
unreasonable
i
done
everything
possible
to
meet
them
nothing
could
have
been
more
manly
and
straightforward
than
my
attitude
i
told
them
in
my
last
letter
but
three
that
i
proposed
to
let
them
have
the
eggs
on
the
instalment
system
and
they
said
i
was
frivolous
they
said
that
to
send
thirteen
eggs
as
payment
for
goods
supplied
to
the
value
of
pounds
was
mere
trifling
trifling
i
trouble
you
that
the
spirit
in
which
they
meet
my
suggestions
it
was
harrod
who
did
that
i
never
met
harrod
personally
but
i
like
to
just
to
ask
him
if
that
his
idea
of
cementing
amiable
business
relations
he
knows
just
as
well
as
anyone
else
that
without
credit
commerce
has
no
elasticity
it
an
elementary
rule
i
bet
he
have
been
sick
if
chappies
had
refused
to
let
him
have
tick
when
he
was
starting
his
store
do
you
suppose
harrod
when
he
started
in
business
paid
cash
down
on
the
nail
for
everything
not
a
bit
of
it
he
went
about
taking
people
by
the
and
asking
them
to
be
good
chaps
and
wait
till
wednesday
week
trifling
why
those
thirteen
eggs
were
absolutely
all
we
had
over
after
beale
had
taken
what
she
wanted
for
the
kitchen
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
anybody
fault
it
beale
that
woman
literally
eats
eggs
the
habit
is
not
confined
to
her
i
said
well
what
i
mean
to
say
is
she
seems
to
bathe
in
them
she
says
she
needs
so
many
for
puddings
dear
said
ukridge
i
spoke
to
her
about
it
yesterday
and
of
course
we
often
have
omelettes
she
ca
make
omelettes
without
breaking
eggs
i
urged
she
ca
make
them
without
breaking
us
dammit
said
ukridge
one
or
two
more
omelettes
and
we
done
for
no
fortune
on
earth
could
stand
it
we
must
have
any
more
omelettes
millie
we
must
economise
millions
of
people
get
on
all
right
without
omelettes
i
suppose
there
are
families
where
if
you
suddenly
produced
an
omelette
the
whole
strength
of
the
company
would
get
up
and
cheer
led
by
father
cancel
the
omelettes
old
girl
from
now
onward
yes
dear
but
well
i
do
beale
would
like
that
very
much
dear
she
has
been
complaining
a
good
deal
about
chicken
at
every
meal
she
says
that
the
omelettes
are
the
only
things
that
give
her
a
chance
she
says
there
are
always
possibilities
in
an
omelette
in
short
i
said
what
you
propose
to
do
is
deliberately
to
remove
from
this
excellent
lady
life
the
one
remaining
element
of
poetry
you
must
do
it
give
beale
her
omelettes
and
let
hope
for
a
larger
supply
of
eggs
another
thing
said
ukridge
it
is
only
that
there
a
shortage
of
eggs
that
would
matter
so
much
if
only
we
kept
hatching
out
fresh
squads
of
chickens
i
not
saying
the
hens
are
doing
their
best
i
take
off
my
hat
to
the
hens
as
nice
a
lot
as
i
ever
want
to
meet
full
of
vigour
and
earnestness
it
that
damned
incubator
that
letting
us
down
all
the
time
the
rotten
thing
work
do
know
what
the
matter
with
it
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
it
simply
declines
to
incubate
perhaps
it
your
dodge
of
letting
down
the
temperature
you
remember
you
were
telling
me
i
forget
the
details
my
dear
old
boy
he
said
earnestly
there
nothing
wrong
with
my
figures
it
a
mathematical
certainty
what
the
good
of
mathematics
if
not
to
help
you
work
out
that
sort
of
thing
no
there
something
deuced
wrong
with
the
machine
itself
and
i
shall
probably
make
a
complaint
to
the
people
i
got
it
from
where
did
we
get
the
incubator
old
girl
harrod
i
think
dear
yes
it
was
harrod
it
came
down
with
the
first
lot
of
things
then
said
ukridge
banging
the
table
with
his
fist
while
his
glasses
flashed
triumph
we
got
the
lord
has
delivered
harrod
into
our
hand
write
and
answer
that
letter
of
theirs
millie
sit
on
them
yes
dear
tell
that
we
have
sent
them
their
confounded
eggs
long
ago
if
only
their
rotten
incubator
had
worked
with
any
approach
to
decency
he
paused
or
would
you
be
sarcastic
garny
old
horse
no
better
put
it
so
that
they
understand
say
that
i
consider
that
the
manufacturer
of
the
thing
ought
to
be
in
colney
hatch
if
he
is
there
already
and
that
they
are
scoundrels
for
palming
off
a
groggy
machine
of
that
sort
on
me
the
ceremony
of
opening
the
morning
letters
at
harrod
ought
to
be
full
of
interest
and
excitement
i
said
this
dashing
seemed
to
relieve
ukridge
his
pessimism
vanished
he
seldom
looked
on
the
dark
side
of
things
for
long
at
a
time
he
began
now
to
speak
hopefully
of
the
future
he
planned
out
ingenious
improvements
our
fowls
were
to
multiply
so
rapidly
and
consistently
that
within
a
short
space
of
time
dorsetshire
would
be
paved
with
them
our
eggs
were
to
increase
in
size
till
they
broke
records
and
got
notices
in
the
items
of
interest
column
in
the
briefly
each
hen
was
to
become
a
happy
combination
of
rabbit
and
ostrich
there
is
certainly
a
good
time
coming
i
said
may
it
be
soon
meanwhile
what
of
the
local
tradesmen
ukridge
relapsed
once
more
into
gloom
they
are
the
worst
of
the
lot
i
do
mind
the
london
people
so
much
they
only
write
and
a
letter
or
two
hurts
nobody
but
when
it
comes
to
butchers
and
bakers
and
grocers
and
fishmongers
and
fruiterers
and
what
not
coming
up
to
one
house
and
dunning
one
in
one
own
garden
well
it
a
little
hard
what
oh
then
those
fellows
i
found
you
talking
to
yesterday
were
duns
i
thought
they
were
farmers
come
to
hear
your
views
on
the
rearing
of
poultry
which
were
they
little
chap
with
black
whiskers
and
long
thin
man
with
beard
that
was
dawlish
the
grocer
and
curtis
the
fishmonger
the
others
had
gone
before
you
came
it
may
be
wondered
why
before
things
came
to
such
a
crisis
i
had
not
placed
my
balance
at
the
bank
at
the
disposal
of
the
senior
partner
for
use
on
behalf
of
the
farm
the
fact
was
that
my
balance
was
at
the
moment
small
i
have
not
yet
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
gone
into
my
pecuniary
position
but
i
may
state
here
that
it
was
an
inconvenient
one
it
was
big
with
possibilities
but
of
ready
cash
there
was
but
a
meagre
supply
my
parents
had
been
poor
but
i
had
a
wealthy
uncle
uncles
are
notoriously
careless
of
the
comfort
of
their
nephews
mine
was
no
exception
he
had
views
he
was
a
great
believer
in
matrimony
as
having
married
three
wives
not
simultaneously
he
had
every
right
to
be
he
was
also
of
opinion
that
the
less
money
the
young
bachelor
possessed
the
better
the
consequence
was
that
he
announced
his
intention
of
giving
me
a
handsome
allowance
from
the
day
that
i
married
but
not
an
instant
before
till
that
glad
day
i
would
have
to
shift
for
myself
and
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
for
an
uncle
it
was
a
remarkably
sensible
idea
i
am
also
of
the
opinion
that
it
is
greatly
to
my
credit
and
a
proof
of
my
pure
and
unmercenary
nature
that
i
did
not
instantly
put
myself
up
to
be
raffled
for
or
rush
out
into
the
streets
and
propose
marriage
to
the
first
lady
i
met
but
i
was
making
quite
enough
with
my
pen
to
support
myself
and
be
it
never
so
humble
there
is
something
pleasant
in
a
bachelor
existence
or
so
i
had
thought
until
very
recently
i
had
thus
no
great
stake
in
ukridge
chicken
farm
i
had
contributed
a
modest
five
pounds
to
the
preliminary
expenses
and
another
five
after
the
roop
incident
but
further
i
could
not
go
with
safety
when
his
income
is
dependent
on
the
whims
of
editors
and
publishers
the
prudent
man
keeps
something
up
his
sleeve
against
a
sudden
slump
in
his
particular
wares
i
did
not
wish
to
have
to
make
a
hurried
choice
between
matrimony
and
the
workhouse
having
exhausted
the
subject
of
finance
or
rather
when
i
began
to
feel
that
it
was
exhausting
me
i
took
my
clubs
and
strolled
up
the
hill
to
the
links
to
play
off
a
match
with
a
sportsman
from
the
village
i
had
entered
some
days
previously
for
a
competition
for
a
trophy
i
quote
the
printed
notice
presented
by
a
local
supporter
of
the
game
in
which
up
to
the
present
i
was
getting
on
nicely
i
had
survived
two
rounds
and
expected
to
beat
my
present
opponent
which
would
bring
me
into
the
unless
i
had
bad
luck
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
get
into
the
final
and
win
it
as
far
as
i
could
gather
from
watching
the
play
of
my
rivals
the
professor
was
the
best
of
them
and
i
was
convinced
that
i
should
have
no
difficulty
with
him
but
he
had
the
most
extraordinary
luck
at
golf
though
he
never
admitted
it
he
also
exercised
quite
an
uncanny
influence
on
his
opponent
i
have
seen
men
put
completely
off
their
stroke
by
his
good
fortune
i
disposed
of
my
man
without
difficulty
we
parted
a
little
coldly
he
had
decapitated
his
brassy
on
the
occasion
of
his
striking
dorsetshire
instead
of
his
ball
and
he
was
slow
in
recovering
from
the
complex
emotions
which
such
an
episode
induces
in
the
i
met
the
professor
whose
demeanour
was
a
welcome
contrast
to
that
of
my
late
opponent
the
professor
had
just
routed
his
opponent
and
so
won
through
to
the
he
was
warm
but
jubilant
i
congratulated
him
and
left
the
place
phyllis
was
waiting
outside
she
often
went
round
the
course
with
him
good
afternoon
i
said
have
you
been
round
with
the
professor
yes
we
must
have
been
in
front
of
you
father
won
his
match
so
he
was
telling
me
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
it
did
you
win
mr
garnet
yes
pretty
easily
my
opponent
had
bad
luck
all
through
bunkers
seemed
to
have
a
magnetic
attraction
for
him
so
you
and
father
are
both
in
the
i
hope
you
will
play
very
badly
thank
you
i
said
yes
it
does
sound
rude
does
it
but
father
has
set
his
heart
on
winning
this
year
do
you
know
that
he
has
played
in
the
final
round
two
years
running
now
really
both
times
he
was
beaten
by
the
same
man
who
was
that
derrick
plays
a
much
better
game
than
anybody
i
have
seen
on
these
links
it
was
nobody
who
is
here
now
it
was
a
colonel
jervis
he
has
not
come
to
combe
regis
this
year
that
why
father
is
hopeful
logically
i
said
he
ought
to
be
certain
to
win
yes
but
you
see
you
were
not
playing
last
year
mr
garnet
oh
the
professor
can
make
rings
round
me
i
said
what
did
you
go
round
in
we
were
playing
and
only
did
the
first
dozen
holes
but
my
average
round
is
somewhere
in
the
late
eighties
the
best
father
has
ever
done
is
ninety
and
that
was
only
once
so
you
see
garnet
there
going
to
be
another
tragedy
this
year
you
make
me
feel
a
perfect
brute
but
it
more
than
likely
you
must
remember
that
i
shall
fail
miserably
if
i
ever
do
play
your
father
in
the
final
there
are
days
when
i
play
golf
as
badly
as
i
play
tennis
you
hardly
believe
me
she
smiled
reminiscently
tom
is
much
too
good
at
tennis
his
service
is
perfectly
dreadful
it
a
little
terrifying
on
first
acquaintance
but
you
better
at
golf
than
at
tennis
garnet
i
wish
you
were
not
this
is
special
pleading
i
said
it
is
fair
to
appeal
to
my
better
feelings
miss
derrick
i
did
know
golfers
had
any
where
golf
was
concerned
do
you
really
have
your
nearly
always
there
are
days
when
i
slice
with
my
driver
as
if
it
were
a
really
and
when
i
could
putt
to
hit
a
haystack
then
i
hope
it
will
be
on
one
of
those
days
that
you
play
father
i
hope
so
too
i
said
you
hope
so
yes
but
do
you
want
to
win
i
should
prefer
to
please
you
really
how
very
unselfish
of
you
garnet
she
replied
with
a
laugh
i
had
no
idea
that
such
chivalry
existed
i
thought
a
golfer
would
sacrifice
anything
to
win
a
game
most
things
and
trample
on
the
feelings
of
anybody
not
everybody
i
said
at
this
point
the
professor
joined
us
chapter
xv
the
arrival
of
nemesis
some
people
do
not
believe
in
presentiments
they
attribute
that
curious
feeling
that
something
unpleasant
is
going
to
happen
to
such
mundane
causes
as
liver
or
a
chill
or
the
weather
for
my
own
part
i
think
there
is
more
in
the
matter
than
the
casual
observer
might
imagine
i
awoke
three
days
after
my
meeting
with
the
professor
at
the
filled
with
a
dull
foreboding
somehow
i
seemed
to
know
that
that
day
was
going
to
turn
out
badly
for
me
it
may
have
been
liver
or
a
chill
but
it
was
certainly
not
the
weather
the
morning
was
perfect
the
most
glorious
of
a
glorious
summer
there
was
a
haze
over
the
valley
and
out
to
sea
which
suggested
a
warm
noon
when
the
sun
should
have
begun
the
serious
duties
of
the
day
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
trees
and
breakfasting
on
the
lawn
while
edwin
seated
on
one
of
the
watched
them
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
occasionally
when
a
sparrow
hopped
in
his
direction
he
would
make
a
sudden
spring
and
the
bird
would
fly
away
to
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
i
had
never
seen
edwin
catch
a
sparrow
i
believe
they
looked
on
him
as
a
bit
of
a
crank
and
humoured
him
by
coming
within
springing
distance
just
to
keep
him
amused
dashing
young
would
show
off
before
their
particular
and
earn
a
cheap
reputation
for
by
going
within
so
many
years
of
lair
and
then
darting
away
bob
was
in
his
favourite
place
on
the
gravel
i
took
him
with
me
down
to
the
cob
to
watch
me
bathe
what
the
matter
with
me
robert
old
son
i
asked
him
as
i
dried
myself
he
blinked
lazily
but
contributed
no
suggestion
it
no
good
looking
bored
i
went
on
because
i
going
to
talk
about
myself
however
much
it
bores
you
here
am
i
as
fit
as
a
living
in
the
open
air
for
i
do
know
how
long
eating
good
plain
food
bathing
every
morning
mind
you
and
yet
what
the
result
i
feel
beastly
bob
yawned
and
gave
a
little
whine
yes
i
said
i
know
i
in
love
but
that
ca
be
it
because
i
was
in
love
just
as
much
a
week
ago
and
i
felt
all
right
then
but
she
an
angel
bob
eh
is
she
and
did
you
feel
bucked
when
she
patted
you
of
course
you
did
anybody
would
but
how
about
tom
chase
do
you
think
he
a
dangerous
man
he
calls
her
by
her
christian
name
you
know
and
behaves
generally
as
if
she
belonged
to
him
and
then
he
sees
her
every
day
while
i
have
to
trust
to
meeting
her
at
odd
times
and
then
i
generally
feel
such
a
fool
i
ca
think
of
anything
to
talk
about
except
golf
and
the
weather
he
probably
sings
duets
with
her
after
dinner
and
you
know
what
comes
of
duets
after
dinner
here
bob
who
had
been
trying
for
some
time
to
find
a
decent
excuse
for
getting
away
pretended
to
see
something
of
importance
at
the
other
end
of
the
cob
and
trotted
off
to
investigate
it
leaving
me
to
finish
dressing
by
myself
of
course
i
said
to
myself
it
may
be
merely
hunger
i
may
be
all
right
after
breakfast
but
at
present
i
seem
to
be
working
up
for
a
really
fine
fit
of
the
blues
i
feel
bad
i
whistled
to
bob
and
started
for
home
on
the
beach
i
saw
the
professor
some
little
distance
away
and
waved
my
towel
in
a
friendly
manner
he
made
no
reply
of
course
it
was
possible
that
he
had
not
seen
me
but
for
some
reason
his
attitude
struck
me
as
ominous
as
far
as
i
could
see
he
was
looking
straight
at
me
and
he
was
not
a
man
i
could
think
of
no
reason
why
he
should
cut
me
we
had
met
on
the
links
on
the
previous
morning
and
he
had
been
friendliness
itself
he
had
called
me
me
dear
boy
supplied
me
with
a
gin
and
gingerbeer
at
the
clubhouse
and
generally
behaved
as
if
he
had
been
david
and
i
jonathan
yet
in
certain
moods
we
are
inclined
to
make
mountains
out
of
molehills
and
i
went
on
my
way
puzzled
and
uneasy
with
a
distinct
impression
that
i
had
received
the
cut
direct
i
felt
hurt
what
had
i
done
that
providence
should
make
things
so
unpleasant
for
me
it
would
be
a
little
hard
as
ukridge
would
have
said
if
after
all
my
trouble
the
professor
had
discovered
some
fresh
grievance
against
me
perhaps
ukridge
had
been
irritating
him
again
i
wished
he
would
not
identify
me
so
completely
with
ukridge
i
could
not
be
expected
to
control
the
man
then
i
reflected
that
they
could
hardly
have
met
in
the
few
hours
between
my
parting
from
the
professor
at
the
and
my
meeting
with
him
on
the
beach
ukridge
rarely
left
the
farm
when
he
was
not
working
among
the
fowls
he
was
lying
on
his
back
in
the
paddock
resting
his
massive
mind
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
after
all
the
professor
had
not
seen
me
i
an
idiot
bob
i
said
as
we
turned
in
at
the
farm
gate
and
i
let
my
imagination
run
away
with
me
bob
wagged
his
tail
in
approval
of
the
sentiment
breakfast
was
ready
when
i
got
in
there
was
a
cold
chicken
on
the
sideboard
devilled
chicken
on
the
table
a
trio
of
boiled
eggs
and
a
dish
of
scrambled
eggs
as
regarded
quantity
beale
never
failed
us
ukridge
was
sorting
the
letters
morning
garny
he
said
one
for
you
millie
it
from
aunt
elizabeth
said
ukridge
looking
at
the
envelope
i
had
only
heard
casual
mention
of
this
relative
hitherto
but
i
had
built
up
a
mental
picture
of
her
partly
from
remarks
which
ukridge
had
let
fall
but
principally
from
the
fact
that
he
had
named
the
most
malignant
hen
in
our
after
her
a
severe
lady
i
imagined
with
a
cold
eye
wish
she
enclose
a
cheque
said
ukridge
she
could
spare
it
you
no
idea
garny
old
man
how
disgustingly
and
indecently
rich
that
woman
is
she
lives
in
kensington
on
an
income
which
would
do
her
well
in
park
lane
but
as
a
touching
proposition
she
had
proved
almost
negligible
she
steadfastly
refuses
to
part
i
think
she
would
dear
if
she
knew
how
much
we
needed
it
but
i
do
like
to
ask
her
she
so
curious
and
says
such
horrid
things
she
does
agreed
ukridge
gloomily
he
spoke
as
one
who
had
had
experience
two
for
you
garny
all
the
rest
for
me
ten
of
them
and
all
bills
he
spread
the
envelopes
out
on
the
table
and
drew
one
at
a
venture
whiteley
he
said
getting
jumpy
are
in
receipt
of
my
favour
of
the
inst
and
are
at
a
loss
to
understand
it
rummy
about
these
blighters
but
they
never
seem
able
to
understand
a
damn
thing
hard
you
put
things
in
words
of
one
syllable
for
them
and
they
just
goggle
and
wonder
what
it
all
means
they
want
something
on
account
upon
my
sam
i
disappointed
with
whiteley
i
been
thinking
in
rather
a
kindly
spirit
of
them
and
feeling
that
they
were
a
more
intelligent
lot
than
harrod
i
had
half
a
mind
to
give
harrod
the
and
hand
my
whole
trade
over
to
these
fellows
but
not
now
dash
it
whiteley
have
disappointed
me
from
the
way
they
write
you
think
they
thought
i
was
doing
it
for
fun
how
can
i
let
them
have
their
infernal
money
when
there
is
any
here
one
from
dorchester
smith
the
chap
we
got
the
gramophone
from
wants
to
know
when
i
going
to
settle
up
for
sixteen
records
sordid
brute
i
wanted
to
get
on
with
my
own
correspondence
but
ukridge
held
me
with
a
glittering
eye
the
the
dealer
people
you
know
want
me
to
pay
for
the
first
lot
of
hens
considering
that
they
all
died
of
roop
and
that
i
was
going
to
send
them
back
anyhow
after
i
got
them
to
hatch
out
a
few
chickens
i
call
that
cool
i
mean
to
say
business
is
business
that
what
these
fellows
do
seem
to
understand
i
ca
afford
to
pay
enormous
sums
for
birds
which
die
off
quicker
than
i
can
get
them
in
i
shall
never
speak
to
aunt
elizabeth
again
said
ukridge
suddenly
she
had
dropped
the
letter
she
had
been
reading
and
was
staring
indignantly
in
front
of
her
there
were
two
little
red
spots
on
her
cheeks
what
the
matter
old
chap
inquired
ukridge
affectionately
glancing
up
from
his
pile
of
bills
and
forgetting
his
own
troubles
in
an
instant
buck
up
aunt
elizabeth
been
getting
on
your
nerves
again
what
she
been
saying
this
time
ukridge
left
the
room
with
a
sob
ukridge
sprang
at
the
letter
if
that
demon
does
stop
writing
her
infernal
letters
and
upsetting
millie
i
shall
strangle
her
with
my
bare
hands
regardless
of
her
age
and
sex
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
letter
till
he
came
to
the
passage
which
had
caused
the
trouble
well
upon
my
sam
listen
to
this
garny
old
horse
tell
me
nothing
regarding
the
success
of
this
chicken
farm
of
yours
and
i
confess
that
i
find
your
silence
ominous
you
know
my
opinion
of
your
husband
he
is
perfectly
helpless
in
any
matter
requiring
the
exercise
of
a
little
and
business
capability
he
stared
at
me
amazed
i
like
that
my
soul
that
is
really
rich
i
could
have
believed
almost
anything
of
that
blighted
female
but
i
did
think
she
had
a
reasonable
amount
of
intelligence
why
you
know
that
it
just
in
matters
requiring
and
business
capability
that
i
come
out
really
strong
of
course
old
man
i
replied
dutifully
the
woman
a
fool
that
what
she
calls
me
two
lines
further
on
no
wonder
millie
was
upset
why
ca
these
cats
leave
people
alone
oh
woman
woman
i
threw
in
helpfully
always
interfering
rotten
and
backbiting
awful
i
sha
stand
it
i
should
look
here
on
the
next
page
she
calls
me
a
gaby
it
time
you
took
a
strong
line
and
in
the
very
next
sentence
refers
to
me
as
a
perfect
guffin
a
guffin
garny
old
boy
i
considered
the
point
broadly
speaking
i
should
say
one
who
guffs
i
believe
it
actionable
i
should
wonder
ukridge
rushed
to
the
door
millie
he
slammed
the
door
and
i
heard
him
dashing
upstairs
i
turned
to
my
letters
one
was
from
lickford
with
a
cornish
postmark
i
glanced
through
it
and
laid
it
aside
for
a
more
exhaustive
perusal
the
other
was
in
a
strange
handwriting
i
looked
at
the
signature
patrick
derrick
this
was
queer
what
had
the
professor
to
say
to
me
the
next
moment
my
heart
seemed
to
spring
to
my
throat
sir
the
letter
began
a
pleasant
cheery
opening
then
it
got
off
the
mark
so
to
speak
like
lightning
there
was
no
sparring
for
an
opening
no
dignified
parade
of
set
phrases
leading
up
to
the
main
point
it
was
the
letter
of
a
man
who
was
almost
too
furious
to
write
it
gave
me
the
impression
that
if
he
had
not
written
it
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
have
taken
some
very
violent
form
of
exercise
by
way
of
relief
to
his
soul
you
will
be
good
enough
to
look
on
our
acquaintance
as
closed
i
have
no
wish
to
associate
with
persons
of
your
stamp
if
we
should
happen
to
meet
you
will
be
good
enough
to
treat
me
as
a
total
stranger
as
i
shall
treat
you
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
give
you
a
word
of
advice
i
should
recommend
you
in
future
when
you
wish
to
exercise
your
humour
to
do
so
in
some
less
practical
manner
than
by
bribing
boatmen
to
upset
your
crossed
out
thickly
and
substituted
if
you
require
further
enlightenment
in
this
matter
the
enclosed
letter
may
be
of
service
to
you
with
which
he
remained
mine
faithfully
patrick
derrick
the
enclosed
letter
was
from
one
jane
muspratt
it
was
bright
and
interesting
dear
sir
my
harry
hawk
sas
to
me
how
it
was
him
upsetting
the
boat
and
you
not
because
he
is
not
steady
in
a
boat
which
he
is
no
man
more
so
in
combe
regis
but
because
one
of
the
gentlemen
what
keeps
chikkens
up
the
hill
the
little
one
garnick
his
name
is
says
to
him
hawk
i
give
you
a
sovrin
to
upset
derick
in
your
boat
and
my
harry
being
esily
led
was
took
in
and
did
but
he
sory
now
and
wishes
he
had
and
he
sas
he
niver
do
a
prackticle
joke
again
for
anyone
even
for
a
yours
jane
muspratt
oh
woman
woman
at
the
bottom
of
everything
history
is
full
of
tragedies
caused
by
the
lethal
sex
who
lost
mark
antony
the
world
a
woman
who
let
samson
in
so
atrociously
woman
again
why
did
bill
bailey
leave
home
once
more
because
of
a
woman
and
here
was
i
jerry
garnet
harmless
writer
of
minor
novels
going
through
the
same
old
mill
i
cursed
jane
muspratt
what
chance
had
i
with
phyllis
now
could
i
hope
to
win
over
the
professor
again
i
cursed
jane
muspratt
for
the
second
time
my
thoughts
wandered
to
harry
hawk
the
villain
the
scoundrel
what
business
had
he
to
betray
me
well
i
could
settle
with
him
the
man
who
lays
a
hand
upon
a
woman
save
in
the
way
of
kindness
is
justly
disliked
by
society
so
the
woman
muspratt
culpable
as
she
was
was
safe
from
me
but
what
of
the
man
hawk
there
no
such
considerations
swayed
me
i
would
interview
the
man
hawk
i
would
give
him
the
most
hectic
ten
minutes
of
his
career
i
would
say
things
to
him
the
recollection
of
which
would
make
him
start
up
shrieking
in
his
bed
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
i
would
arise
and
be
a
man
and
slay
him
take
him
grossly
full
of
bread
with
all
his
crimes
as
flush
as
may
at
gaming
swearing
or
about
some
act
that
had
no
relish
of
salvation
in
it
the
demon
my
life
ruined
my
future
grey
and
black
my
heart
shattered
and
why
because
of
the
scoundrel
hawk
phyllis
would
meet
me
in
the
village
on
the
cob
on
the
links
and
pass
by
as
if
i
were
the
invisible
man
and
why
because
of
the
reptile
hawk
the
worm
hawk
the
dastard
and
varlet
hawk
i
crammed
my
hat
on
and
hurried
out
of
the
house
towards
the
village
chapter
xvi
a
chance
meeting
i
roamed
the
place
in
search
of
the
varlet
for
the
space
of
and
after
having
drawn
all
his
familiar
haunts
found
him
at
length
leaning
over
the
near
the
church
gazing
thoughtfully
into
the
waters
below
i
confronted
him
well
i
said
you
a
beauty
are
you
he
eyed
me
owlishly
even
at
this
early
hour
i
was
grieved
to
see
he
showed
signs
of
having
looked
on
the
bitter
while
it
was
brown
his
eyes
were
filmy
and
his
manner
aggressively
solemn
beauty
he
echoed
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
say
it
was
plain
that
he
was
engaged
in
pulling
his
faculties
together
by
some
laborious
process
known
only
to
himself
at
present
my
words
conveyed
no
meaning
to
him
he
was
trying
to
identify
me
he
had
seen
me
before
somewhere
he
was
certain
but
he
could
not
say
where
or
who
i
was
i
want
to
know
i
said
what
induced
you
to
be
such
an
abject
idiot
as
to
let
our
arrangement
get
known
i
spoke
quietly
i
was
not
going
to
waste
the
choicer
flowers
of
speech
on
a
man
who
was
incapable
of
understanding
them
later
on
when
he
had
awakened
to
a
sense
of
his
position
i
would
begin
really
to
talk
to
him
he
continued
to
stare
at
me
then
a
sudden
flash
of
intelligence
lit
up
his
features
garnick
he
said
at
last
from
ch
chicken
farm
he
continued
with
the
triumphant
air
of
a
king
counsel
who
has
at
last
got
on
the
track
yes
i
said
up
top
the
hill
he
proceeded
clinchingly
he
stretched
out
a
huge
hand
how
you
he
inquired
with
a
friendly
grin
i
want
to
know
i
said
distinctly
what
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
after
letting
our
affair
with
the
professor
become
public
property
he
paused
awhile
in
thought
dear
sir
he
said
at
last
as
if
he
were
dictating
a
letter
dear
sir
i
owe
you
ex
exp
he
waved
his
hand
as
who
should
say
it
a
stiff
job
but
i
going
to
do
it
explashion
he
said
you
do
said
i
grimly
i
should
like
to
hear
it
dear
sir
listen
me
go
on
then
you
came
me
you
said
hawk
ol
fren
listen
me
you
tip
this
ol
bufflehead
into
watter
you
said
gormed
if
i
do
give
a
poond
note
that
what
you
said
me
is
that
what
you
said
me
i
did
not
deny
it
well
i
said
you
i
said
i
tipped
the
ol
soul
into
watter
and
i
got
the
poond
note
yes
you
took
care
of
that
all
this
is
quite
true
but
it
beside
the
point
we
are
not
disputing
about
what
happened
what
i
want
to
know
for
the
third
time
is
what
made
you
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
why
could
you
keep
quiet
about
it
he
waved
his
hand
dear
sir
he
replied
this
way
listen
me
it
was
a
tragic
story
that
he
unfolded
my
wrath
ebbed
as
i
listened
after
all
the
fellow
was
not
so
greatly
to
blame
i
felt
that
in
his
place
i
should
have
acted
as
he
had
done
it
was
fate
fault
and
fate
alone
it
appeared
that
he
had
not
come
well
out
of
the
matter
of
the
accident
i
had
not
looked
at
it
hitherto
from
his
point
of
view
while
the
rescue
had
left
me
the
popular
hero
it
had
had
quite
the
opposite
result
for
him
he
had
upset
his
boat
and
would
have
drowned
his
passenger
said
public
opinion
if
the
young
hero
from
london
myself
had
not
plunged
in
and
at
the
risk
of
his
life
brought
the
professor
ashore
consequently
he
was
despised
by
all
as
an
inefficient
boatman
he
became
a
the
local
wags
made
laborious
jests
when
he
passed
they
offered
him
fabulous
sums
to
take
their
worst
enemies
out
for
a
row
with
him
they
wanted
to
know
when
he
was
going
to
school
to
learn
his
business
in
fact
they
behaved
as
wags
do
and
always
have
done
at
all
times
all
the
world
over
now
all
this
it
seemed
hawk
would
have
borne
cheerfully
and
patiently
for
my
sake
or
at
any
rate
for
the
sake
of
the
crisp
pound
note
i
had
given
him
but
a
fresh
factor
appeared
in
the
problem
complicating
it
grievously
to
wit
miss
jane
muspratt
she
said
to
me
explained
hawk
with
pathos
she
said
a
girt
fule
an
i
do
marry
noone
as
is
ai
to
be
trusted
in
a
boat
by
hisself
and
what
has
jokes
made
about
him
by
that
tom
leigh
i
punched
tom
leigh
observed
hawk
parenthetically
she
said
me
can
go
away
an
i
do
want
to
see
yeou
again
this
heartless
conduct
on
the
part
of
miss
muspratt
had
had
the
natural
result
of
making
him
confess
in
and
she
had
written
to
the
professor
the
same
night
i
forgave
hawk
i
think
he
was
hardly
sober
enough
to
understand
for
he
betrayed
no
emotion
it
is
fate
hawk
i
said
simply
fate
there
is
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
them
how
we
will
and
it
no
good
grumbling
yiss
said
hawk
after
chewing
this
sentiment
for
a
while
in
silence
so
she
said
me
she
said
like
that
a
girt
fule
that
all
right
i
replied
i
quite
understand
as
i
say
simply
fate
and
i
left
him
as
i
was
going
back
i
met
the
professor
and
phyllis
they
passed
me
without
a
look
i
wandered
on
in
quite
a
fervour
of
i
was
in
one
of
those
moods
when
life
suddenly
seems
to
become
irksome
when
the
future
stretches
black
and
grey
in
front
of
one
i
should
have
liked
to
have
faded
almost
imperceptibly
from
the
world
like
bardell
even
if
as
in
his
case
it
had
involved
being
knocked
on
the
head
with
a
pint
pot
in
a
cellar
in
such
a
mood
it
is
imperative
that
one
should
seek
distraction
the
shining
example
of
harry
hawk
did
not
lure
me
taking
to
drink
would
be
a
nuisance
work
was
what
i
wanted
i
would
toil
like
a
navvy
all
day
among
the
fowls
separating
them
when
they
fought
gathering
in
the
eggs
when
they
laid
chasing
them
across
country
when
they
got
away
and
even
if
necessity
arose
painting
their
throats
with
turpentine
when
they
were
stricken
with
roop
then
after
dinner
when
the
lamps
were
lit
and
ukridge
nursed
edwin
and
sewed
and
ukridge
smoked
cigars
and
incited
the
gramophone
to
murder
mumbling
mose
i
would
steal
away
to
my
bedroom
and
write
and
write
and
and
go
on
writing
till
my
fingers
were
numb
and
my
eyes
refused
to
do
their
duty
and
when
time
had
passed
i
might
come
to
feel
that
it
was
all
for
the
best
a
man
must
go
through
the
fire
before
he
can
write
his
masterpiece
we
learn
in
suffering
what
we
teach
in
song
what
we
lose
on
the
swings
we
make
up
on
the
roundabouts
jerry
garnet
the
man
might
become
a
depressed
hopeless
wreck
with
the
iron
planted
immovably
in
his
soul
but
jeremy
garnet
the
author
should
turn
out
such
a
novel
of
gloom
that
strong
critics
would
weep
and
the
public
jostle
for
copies
till
mudie
doorway
became
a
shambles
thus
might
i
some
day
feel
that
all
this
anguish
was
really
a
blessing
effectively
disguised
but
i
doubted
it
we
were
none
of
us
very
cheerful
now
at
the
farm
even
ukridge
spirit
was
a
little
daunted
by
the
bills
which
poured
in
by
every
post
it
was
as
if
the
tradesmen
of
the
neighbourhood
had
formed
a
league
and
were
working
in
concert
or
it
may
have
been
due
to
little
accounts
came
not
in
single
spies
but
in
battalions
the
popular
demand
for
the
sight
of
the
colour
of
his
money
grew
daily
every
morning
at
breakfast
he
would
give
us
fresh
bulletins
of
the
state
of
mind
of
each
of
our
creditors
and
thrill
us
with
the
announcement
that
were
getting
cross
and
harrod
jumpy
or
that
the
bearings
of
dawlish
the
grocer
were
becoming
overheated
we
lived
in
a
continual
atmosphere
of
worry
chicken
and
nothing
but
chicken
at
meals
and
chicken
and
nothing
but
chicken
between
meals
had
frayed
our
nerves
an
air
of
defeat
hung
over
the
place
we
were
a
beaten
side
and
we
realised
it
we
had
been
playing
an
uphill
game
for
nearly
two
months
and
the
strain
was
beginning
to
tell
ukridge
became
uncannily
silent
ukridge
though
she
did
not
understand
i
fancy
the
details
of
the
matter
was
worried
because
ukridge
was
beale
had
long
since
been
turned
into
a
soured
cynic
by
the
lack
of
chances
vouchsafed
her
for
the
exercise
of
her
art
and
as
for
me
i
have
never
since
spent
so
profoundly
miserably
a
week
i
was
not
even
permitted
the
anodyne
of
work
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
do
on
the
farm
the
chickens
were
quite
happy
and
only
asked
to
be
let
alone
and
allowed
to
have
their
meals
at
regular
intervals
and
every
day
one
or
more
of
their
number
would
vanish
into
the
kitchen
beale
would
serve
up
the
corpse
in
some
cunning
disguise
and
we
would
try
to
delude
ourselves
into
the
idea
that
it
was
something
altogether
different
there
was
one
solitary
gleam
of
variety
in
our
menu
an
editor
sent
me
a
cheque
for
a
set
of
verses
we
cashed
that
cheque
and
trooped
round
the
town
in
a
body
laying
out
the
money
we
bought
a
leg
of
mutton
and
a
tongue
and
sardines
and
chunks
and
potted
meat
and
many
other
noble
things
and
had
a
perfect
banquet
beale
with
the
scenario
of
a
smile
on
her
face
the
first
that
she
had
worn
in
these
days
of
stress
brought
in
the
joint
and
uncovered
it
with
an
air
thank
god
said
ukridge
as
he
began
to
carve
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
heard
him
say
a
grace
and
if
ever
an
occasion
merited
such
a
deviation
from
habit
this
occasion
did
after
that
we
relapsed
into
routine
again
deprived
of
physical
labour
with
the
exception
of
golf
and
bathing
trivial
sports
compared
with
work
in
the
at
its
hardest
i
tried
to
make
up
for
it
by
working
at
my
novel
it
refused
to
materialise
the
only
progress
i
achieved
was
with
my
villain
i
drew
him
from
the
professor
and
made
him
a
blackmailer
he
had
several
other
social
defects
but
that
was
his
profession
that
was
the
thing
he
did
really
well
it
was
on
one
of
the
many
occasions
on
which
i
had
sat
in
my
room
pen
in
hand
through
the
whole
of
a
lovely
afternoon
with
no
better
result
than
a
slight
headache
that
i
bethought
me
of
that
little
paradise
on
the
ware
cliff
hung
over
the
sea
and
backed
by
green
woods
i
had
not
been
there
for
some
time
owing
principally
to
an
entirely
erroneous
idea
that
i
could
do
more
solid
work
sitting
in
a
straight
hard
chair
at
a
table
than
lying
on
soft
turf
with
the
sea
wind
in
my
eyes
but
now
the
desire
to
visit
that
little
clearing
again
drove
me
from
my
room
in
the
below
the
gramophone
was
dealing
brassily
with
mister
blackman
outside
the
sun
was
just
thinking
of
setting
the
ware
cliff
was
the
best
medicine
for
me
what
does
kipling
say
and
soon
you
will
find
that
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
the
djinn
of
the
garden
too
have
lightened
the
hump
cameelious
hump
the
hump
that
is
black
and
blue
his
instructions
include
digging
with
a
hoe
and
a
shovel
also
but
i
could
omit
that
the
sun
and
the
wind
were
what
i
needed
i
took
the
upper
road
in
certain
moods
i
preferred
it
to
the
path
along
the
cliff
i
walked
fast
the
exercise
was
soothing
to
reach
my
favourite
clearing
i
had
to
take
to
the
fields
on
the
left
and
strike
down
hill
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
i
hurried
down
the
narrow
path
i
broke
into
the
clearing
at
a
jog
trot
and
stood
panting
and
at
the
same
moment
looking
cool
and
beautiful
in
her
white
dress
phyllis
entered
in
from
the
other
side
phyllis
without
the
professor
chapter
xvii
of
a
sentimental
nature
she
was
wearing
a
panama
and
she
carried
a
and
good
evening
i
said
good
evening
said
she
it
is
curious
how
different
the
same
words
can
sound
when
spoken
by
different
people
my
good
evening
might
have
been
that
of
a
man
with
a
particularly
guilty
conscience
caught
in
the
act
of
doing
something
more
than
usually
ignoble
she
spoke
like
a
rather
offended
angel
it
a
lovely
evening
i
went
on
pluckily
very
the
sunset
yes
er
she
raised
a
pair
of
blue
eyes
devoid
of
all
expression
save
a
faint
suggestion
of
surprise
and
gazed
through
me
for
a
moment
at
some
object
a
couple
of
thousand
miles
away
and
lowered
them
again
leaving
me
with
a
vague
feeling
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
personal
appearance
very
calmly
she
moved
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
arranged
her
and
sat
down
neither
of
us
spoke
a
word
i
watched
her
while
she
filled
a
little
mug
with
water
from
a
little
bottle
opened
her
selected
a
brush
and
placed
her
in
position
she
began
to
paint
now
by
all
the
laws
of
good
taste
i
should
before
this
have
made
a
dignified
exit
it
was
plain
that
i
was
not
to
be
regarded
as
an
essential
ornament
of
this
portion
of
the
ware
cliff
by
now
if
i
had
been
the
perfect
gentleman
i
ought
to
have
been
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
but
there
is
a
definite
limit
to
what
a
man
can
do
i
remained
the
sinking
sun
flung
a
carpet
of
gold
across
the
sea
phyllis
hair
was
tinged
with
it
little
waves
tumbled
lazily
on
the
beach
below
except
for
the
song
of
a
distant
blackbird
running
through
its
repertoire
before
retiring
for
the
night
everything
was
silent
she
sat
there
dipping
and
painting
and
dipping
again
with
never
a
word
for
me
standing
patiently
and
humbly
behind
her
miss
derrick
i
said
she
half
turned
her
head
yes
why
wo
you
speak
to
me
i
said
i
do
understand
you
why
wo
you
speak
to
me
i
think
you
know
mr
garnet
it
is
because
of
that
boat
accident
accident
episode
i
amended
she
went
on
painting
in
silence
from
where
i
stood
i
could
see
her
profile
her
chin
was
tilted
her
expression
was
determined
is
it
i
said
need
we
discuss
it
not
if
you
do
not
wish
it
i
paused
but
i
added
i
should
have
liked
a
chance
to
defend
myself
what
glorious
sunsets
there
have
been
these
last
few
days
i
believe
we
shall
have
this
sort
of
weather
for
another
month
i
should
not
have
thought
that
possible
the
glass
is
going
up
i
said
i
was
not
talking
about
the
weather
it
was
dull
of
me
to
introduce
such
a
topic
you
said
you
could
defend
yourself
i
said
i
should
like
the
chance
to
do
so
you
have
it
that
very
kind
of
you
thank
you
is
there
any
reason
for
gratitude
every
reason
go
on
garnet
i
can
listen
while
i
paint
but
please
sit
down
i
do
like
being
talked
to
from
a
height
i
sat
down
on
the
grass
in
front
of
her
feeling
as
i
did
so
that
the
change
of
position
in
a
manner
clipped
my
wings
it
is
difficult
to
speak
movingly
while
sitting
on
the
ground
instinctively
i
avoided
eloquence
standing
up
i
might
have
been
pathetic
and
pleading
sitting
down
i
was
compelled
to
be
you
remember
of
course
the
night
you
and
professor
derrick
dined
with
us
when
i
say
dined
i
use
the
word
in
a
loose
sense
for
a
moment
i
thought
she
was
going
to
smile
we
were
both
thinking
of
edwin
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
and
then
her
face
grew
cold
once
more
and
the
chin
resumed
its
angle
of
determination
yes
she
said
you
remember
the
unfortunate
ending
of
the
festivities
well
if
you
recall
that
at
all
clearly
you
will
also
remember
that
the
fault
was
not
mine
but
ukridge
well
it
was
his
behaviour
that
annoyed
professor
derrick
the
position
then
was
this
that
i
was
to
be
cut
off
from
the
pleasantest
friendship
i
had
ever
formed
i
stopped
for
a
moment
she
bent
a
little
lower
over
her
easel
but
remained
simply
through
the
tactlessness
of
a
prize
idiot
i
like
mr
ukridge
i
like
him
too
but
i
ca
pretend
that
he
is
anything
but
an
idiot
at
times
well
i
naturally
wished
to
mend
matters
it
occurred
to
me
that
an
excellent
way
would
be
by
doing
your
father
a
service
it
was
seeing
him
fishing
that
put
the
idea
of
a
into
my
head
i
hoped
for
a
genuine
but
those
things
only
happen
when
one
does
not
want
them
so
i
determined
to
engineer
one
you
did
think
of
the
shock
to
my
father
i
did
it
worried
me
very
much
but
you
upset
him
all
the
same
reluctantly
she
looked
up
and
our
eyes
met
i
could
detect
no
trace
of
forgiveness
in
hers
you
behaved
abominably
she
said
i
played
a
risky
game
and
i
lost
and
i
shall
now
take
the
consequences
with
luck
i
should
have
won
i
did
not
have
luck
and
i
am
not
going
to
grumble
about
it
but
i
am
grateful
to
you
for
letting
me
explain
i
should
not
have
liked
you
to
have
gone
on
thinking
that
i
played
practical
jokes
on
my
friends
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
i
think
it
was
kind
of
you
to
listen
miss
derrick
i
got
up
are
you
going
why
not
please
sit
down
again
but
you
wish
to
be
alone
please
sit
down
there
was
a
flush
on
the
cheek
turned
towards
me
and
the
chin
was
tilted
higher
i
sat
down
to
westward
the
sky
had
changed
to
the
hue
of
a
bruised
cherry
the
sun
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
and
the
sea
looked
cold
and
leaden
the
blackbird
had
long
since
flown
i
am
glad
you
told
me
mr
garnet
she
dipped
her
brush
in
the
water
because
i
do
like
to
think
badly
of
people
she
bent
her
head
over
her
painting
though
i
still
think
you
behaved
very
wrongly
and
i
am
afraid
my
father
will
never
forgive
you
for
what
you
did
her
father
as
if
he
counted
but
you
do
i
said
eagerly
i
think
you
are
less
to
blame
than
i
thought
you
were
at
first
no
more
than
that
you
ca
expect
to
escape
all
consequences
you
did
a
very
stupid
thing
i
was
tempted
the
sky
was
a
dull
grey
now
it
was
growing
dusk
the
grass
on
which
i
sat
was
wet
with
dew
i
stood
up
is
it
getting
a
little
dark
for
painting
i
said
are
you
sure
you
wo
catch
cold
it
very
damp
perhaps
it
is
and
it
is
late
too
she
shut
her
and
emptied
the
little
mug
on
to
the
grass
may
i
carry
your
things
i
said
i
think
she
hesitated
but
only
for
a
moment
i
possessed
myself
of
the
and
we
started
on
our
homeward
journey
we
were
both
silent
the
spell
of
the
quiet
summer
evening
was
on
us
all
the
air
a
solemn
stillness
holds
she
said
softly
i
love
this
cliff
garnet
it
the
most
soothing
place
in
the
world
i
found
it
so
this
evening
she
glanced
at
me
quickly
you
not
looking
well
she
said
are
you
sure
you
are
not
overworking
yourself
no
it
not
that
somehow
we
had
stopped
as
if
by
agreement
and
were
facing
each
other
there
was
a
look
in
her
eyes
i
had
never
seen
there
before
the
twilight
hung
like
a
curtain
between
us
and
the
world
we
were
alone
together
in
a
world
of
our
own
it
is
because
i
had
offended
you
i
said
she
laughed
a
high
unnatural
laugh
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
i
first
saw
you
i
said
doggedly
chapter
xviii
ukridge
gives
me
advice
hours
after
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
we
reached
the
spot
at
which
our
ways
divided
we
stopped
and
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
suddenly
cast
back
into
the
workaday
world
from
some
distant
and
pleasanter
planet
i
think
phyllis
must
have
felt
much
the
same
sensation
for
we
both
became
on
the
instant
intensely
practical
and
businesslike
but
about
your
father
i
said
that
the
difficulty
he
wo
give
us
his
consent
i
afraid
he
would
dream
of
it
you
ca
persuade
him
i
can
in
most
things
but
not
in
this
you
see
even
if
nothing
had
happened
he
would
like
to
lose
me
just
yet
because
of
norah
norah
my
sister
she
going
to
be
married
in
october
i
wonder
if
we
shall
ever
be
as
happy
as
they
will
happy
they
will
be
miserable
compared
with
us
not
that
i
know
who
the
man
is
why
tom
of
course
do
you
mean
to
say
you
really
did
know
tom
tom
chase
of
course
i
gasped
well
i
hanged
i
said
when
i
think
of
the
torments
i
been
through
because
of
that
wretched
man
and
all
for
nothing
i
do
know
what
to
say
do
you
like
tom
very
much
i
always
did
but
i
was
awfully
jealous
of
him
you
were
how
silly
of
you
of
course
i
was
he
was
always
about
with
you
and
called
you
phyllis
and
generally
behaved
as
if
you
and
he
were
the
heroine
and
hero
of
a
musical
comedy
so
what
else
could
i
think
i
heard
you
singing
duets
after
dinner
once
i
drew
the
worst
conclusions
when
was
that
what
were
you
doing
there
it
was
shortly
after
ukridge
had
got
on
your
father
nerves
and
nipped
our
acquaintance
in
the
bud
i
used
to
come
every
night
to
the
hedge
opposite
your
window
and
brood
there
by
the
hour
poor
old
boy
hoping
to
hear
you
sing
and
when
you
did
sing
and
he
joined
in
all
flat
i
used
to
swear
you
probably
find
most
of
the
bark
scorched
off
the
tree
i
leaned
against
poor
old
man
still
it
all
over
now
is
it
and
when
i
was
doing
my
very
best
to
show
off
before
you
at
tennis
you
went
away
just
as
i
got
into
form
i
very
sorry
but
i
could
know
could
i
i
thought
you
always
played
like
that
i
know
i
knew
you
would
it
nearly
turned
my
hair
white
i
did
see
how
a
girl
could
ever
care
for
a
man
who
was
so
bad
at
tennis
one
does
love
a
man
because
he
good
at
tennis
what
a
girl
see
to
love
in
a
man
i
inquired
abruptly
and
paused
on
the
verge
of
a
great
discovery
oh
i
do
know
she
replied
most
unsatisfactorily
and
i
could
draw
no
views
from
her
but
about
father
said
she
what
we
to
do
he
objects
to
me
he
perfectly
furious
with
you
blow
blow
i
said
thou
winter
wind
thou
are
not
so
unkind
he
never
forgive
you
as
man
ingratitude
i
saved
his
life
at
the
risk
of
my
own
why
i
believe
i
got
a
legal
claim
on
him
who
ever
heard
of
a
man
having
his
life
saved
and
not
being
delighted
when
his
preserver
wanted
to
marry
his
daughter
your
father
is
striking
at
the
very
root
of
the
writer
little
earnings
he
must
be
allowed
to
do
it
jerry
i
started
again
i
said
what
say
it
again
do
please
now
very
well
jerry
it
was
the
first
time
you
had
called
me
by
my
christian
name
i
suppose
you
the
remotest
notion
how
splendid
it
sounds
when
you
say
it
there
is
something
poetical
almost
holy
about
it
jerry
please
say
on
do
be
sensible
do
you
see
how
serious
this
is
we
must
think
how
we
can
make
father
consent
all
right
i
said
we
tackle
the
point
i
sorry
to
be
frivolous
but
i
so
happy
i
ca
keep
it
all
in
i
got
you
and
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
try
i
pull
myself
together
now
say
on
once
more
we
ca
marry
without
his
consent
why
not
i
said
not
having
a
marked
respect
for
the
whims
gretna
green
is
out
of
date
but
there
are
registrars
i
hate
the
very
idea
of
a
registrar
she
said
with
decision
besides
well
poor
father
would
never
get
over
it
we
always
been
such
friends
if
i
married
against
his
wishes
he
would
oh
you
know
not
let
me
near
him
again
and
not
write
to
me
and
he
would
hate
it
all
the
time
he
was
doing
it
he
would
be
bored
to
death
without
me
who
would
i
said
because
you
see
norah
has
never
been
quite
the
same
she
has
spent
such
a
lot
of
her
time
on
visits
to
people
that
she
and
father
understand
each
other
so
well
as
he
and
i
do
she
would
try
and
be
nice
to
him
but
she
would
know
him
as
i
do
and
besides
she
will
be
with
him
such
a
little
now
she
going
to
be
married
but
look
here
i
said
this
is
absurd
you
say
your
father
would
never
see
you
again
and
so
on
if
you
married
me
why
it
nonsense
it
is
as
if
i
were
a
sort
of
social
outcast
we
were
the
best
of
friends
till
that
man
hawk
gave
me
away
like
that
i
know
but
he
very
obstinate
about
some
things
you
see
he
thinks
the
whole
thing
has
made
him
look
ridiculous
and
it
will
take
him
a
long
time
to
forgive
you
for
that
i
realised
the
truth
of
this
one
can
pardon
any
injury
to
oneself
unless
it
hurts
one
vanity
moreover
even
in
a
genuine
case
of
rescue
the
rescued
man
must
always
feel
a
little
aggrieved
with
his
rescuer
when
he
thinks
the
matter
over
in
cold
blood
he
must
regard
him
unconsciously
as
the
super
regards
the
indebted
to
him
for
the
means
of
supporting
existence
but
grudging
him
the
limelight
and
the
centre
of
the
stage
and
the
applause
besides
every
one
instinctively
dislikes
being
under
an
obligation
which
they
can
never
wholly
repay
and
when
a
man
discovers
that
he
has
experienced
all
these
mixed
sensations
for
nothing
as
the
professor
had
done
his
wrath
is
likely
to
be
no
slight
thing
taking
everything
into
consideration
i
could
not
but
feel
that
it
would
require
more
than
a
little
persuasion
to
make
the
professor
bestow
his
blessing
with
that
genial
warmth
which
we
like
to
see
in
our
elect
you
do
think
i
said
that
time
the
great
healer
and
so
on
he
wo
feel
kindlier
disposed
towards
me
say
in
a
month
time
of
course
he
said
phyllis
but
she
spoke
doubtfully
he
strikes
me
from
what
i
have
seen
of
him
as
a
man
of
moods
i
might
do
something
one
of
these
days
which
would
completely
alter
his
views
we
will
hope
for
the
best
about
telling
father
need
we
do
you
think
i
said
yes
we
must
i
could
bear
to
think
that
i
was
keeping
it
from
him
i
do
think
i
ever
kept
anything
from
him
in
my
life
nothing
bad
i
mean
you
count
this
among
your
darker
crimes
then
i
was
looking
at
it
from
father
point
of
view
he
will
be
awfully
angry
i
do
know
how
i
shall
begin
telling
him
good
heavens
i
cried
you
surely
do
think
i
going
to
let
you
do
that
keep
safely
out
of
the
way
while
you
tell
him
not
much
coming
back
with
you
now
and
we
break
the
bad
news
together
no
not
he
may
be
tired
and
rather
cross
we
had
better
wait
till
you
might
speak
to
him
in
the
morning
where
shall
i
find
him
he
is
certain
to
go
to
the
beach
before
breakfast
for
a
swim
good
i
be
there
ukridge
i
said
when
i
got
back
i
want
your
advice
it
stirred
him
like
a
trumpet
blast
i
suppose
when
a
man
is
in
the
habit
of
giving
unsolicited
counsel
to
everyone
he
meets
it
is
as
invigorating
as
an
electric
shock
to
him
to
be
asked
for
it
spontaneously
bring
it
out
laddie
he
replied
cordially
i
with
you
here
come
along
into
the
garden
and
state
your
case
this
suited
me
it
is
always
easier
to
talk
intimately
in
the
dark
and
i
did
not
wish
to
be
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
hired
man
or
beale
of
which
there
was
always
a
danger
indoors
we
walked
down
to
the
paddock
ukridge
lit
a
cigar
ukridge
i
said
i
engaged
what
a
huge
hand
whistled
through
the
darkness
and
smote
me
heavily
between
the
by
jove
old
boy
i
wish
you
luck
my
sam
i
do
best
thing
in
the
world
for
you
bachelors
are
mere
excrescences
never
knew
what
happiness
was
till
i
married
when
the
wedding
to
be
that
where
i
want
your
advice
what
you
might
call
a
difficulty
has
arisen
about
the
wedding
it
like
this
i
engaged
to
phyllis
derrick
derrick
derrick
you
ca
have
forgotten
her
good
lord
what
eyes
some
men
have
why
if
i
only
seen
her
once
i
should
have
remembered
her
all
my
life
i
know
now
rather
a
pretty
girl
with
blue
eyes
i
stared
at
him
blankly
it
was
not
much
good
as
he
could
not
see
my
face
but
it
relieved
me
rather
a
pretty
girl
what
a
description
of
course
yes
continued
ukridge
she
came
to
dinner
here
one
night
with
her
father
that
fat
little
buffer
as
you
were
careful
to
call
him
to
his
face
at
the
time
confound
you
it
was
that
that
started
all
the
trouble
trouble
what
trouble
why
her
father
by
jove
i
remember
now
so
worried
lately
old
boy
that
my
gone
groggy
of
course
her
father
fell
into
the
sea
and
you
fished
him
out
why
damme
it
like
the
stories
you
read
it
also
very
like
the
stories
i
used
to
write
but
they
had
one
point
about
them
which
this
story
has
they
invariably
ended
happily
with
the
father
joining
the
hero
and
heroine
hands
and
giving
his
blessing
unfortunately
in
the
present
case
that
seem
likely
to
happen
the
old
man
wo
give
his
consent
i
afraid
not
i
have
asked
him
yet
but
the
chances
are
against
it
but
why
what
the
matter
with
you
you
an
excellent
chap
sound
in
wind
and
limb
and
did
you
once
tell
me
that
if
you
married
you
came
into
a
pretty
sizeable
bit
of
money
yes
i
do
that
part
of
it
is
all
right
ukridge
voice
betrayed
perplexity
i
do
understand
this
thing
old
horse
he
said
i
should
have
thought
the
old
boy
would
have
been
all
over
you
why
damme
i
never
heard
of
anything
like
it
you
saved
his
life
you
fished
him
out
of
the
water
after
chucking
him
in
that
the
trouble
you
chucked
him
in
by
proxy
i
explained
ukridge
i
regret
to
say
laughed
in
a
way
that
must
have
been
heard
miles
away
in
distant
villages
in
devonshire
you
devil
he
bellowed
my
sam
old
horse
to
look
at
you
one
would
never
have
thought
you
have
had
it
in
you
i
ca
help
looking
respectable
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
that
where
i
wanted
your
advice
you
a
man
of
resource
what
would
you
do
in
my
place
ukridge
tapped
me
impressively
on
the
shoulder
laddie
he
said
there
one
thing
that
carry
you
through
any
mess
and
that
is
cheek
my
boy
cheek
gall
nerve
why
take
my
case
i
never
told
you
how
i
came
to
marry
did
i
thought
not
well
it
was
this
way
do
you
a
bit
of
good
perhaps
to
hear
the
story
for
mark
you
blessings
were
going
cheap
in
my
case
either
you
know
millie
aunt
elizabeth
the
female
who
wrote
that
letter
well
when
i
tell
you
that
she
was
millie
nearest
relative
and
that
it
was
her
consent
i
had
to
snaffle
you
see
that
i
was
faced
with
a
bit
of
a
problem
let
have
it
i
said
well
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
millie
was
in
a
carriage
on
the
underground
i
got
a
ticket
by
the
way
the
carriage
was
full
and
i
got
up
and
gave
her
my
seat
and
as
i
hung
suspended
over
her
by
a
strap
damme
i
fell
in
love
with
her
then
and
there
you
no
conception
laddie
how
indescribably
ripping
she
looked
in
a
sort
of
blue
dress
with
a
bit
of
red
in
it
and
a
hat
with
thingummies
well
we
both
got
out
at
south
kensington
by
that
time
i
was
gasping
for
air
and
saw
that
the
thing
wanted
looking
into
never
had
much
time
to
bother
about
women
but
i
realised
that
this
must
not
be
missed
i
was
in
love
old
horse
it
comes
over
you
quite
suddenly
like
a
tidal
wave
i
know
i
know
good
heavens
you
ca
tell
me
anything
about
that
well
i
followed
her
she
went
to
a
house
in
thurloe
square
i
waited
outside
and
thought
it
over
i
had
got
to
get
into
that
shanty
and
make
her
acquaintance
if
they
threw
me
out
on
my
ear
so
i
rang
the
bell
lady
lichenhall
at
home
i
asked
you
spot
the
devilish
cunning
of
the
ruse
what
my
asking
for
a
female
with
a
title
was
to
make
think
i
was
one
of
the
upper
ten
how
were
you
dressed
i
could
not
help
asking
oh
it
was
one
of
my
days
i
been
to
see
a
man
about
tutoring
his
son
and
by
a
merciful
dispensation
of
providence
there
was
a
fellow
living
in
the
same
with
me
who
was
about
my
build
and
had
a
and
he
had
lent
it
to
me
at
least
he
had
exactly
lent
it
to
me
but
i
knew
where
he
kept
it
and
he
was
out
at
the
time
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
my
appearance
quite
the
young
duke
i
assure
you
laddie
down
to
the
last
button
lady
lichenhall
at
home
i
asked
said
the
maid
of
that
name
here
this
is
lady
lakenheath
house
so
you
see
i
had
a
bit
of
luck
at
the
start
because
the
names
were
a
bit
alike
well
i
got
the
maid
to
show
me
in
somehow
and
once
in
you
can
bet
i
talked
for
all
i
was
worth
kept
up
a
flow
of
conversation
about
being
misdirected
and
coming
to
the
wrong
house
went
away
and
called
a
few
days
later
gradually
wormed
my
way
in
called
regularly
spied
on
their
movements
met
at
every
theatre
they
went
to
and
bowed
and
finally
got
away
with
millie
before
her
aunt
knew
what
was
happening
or
who
i
was
or
what
i
was
doing
or
anything
and
what
the
moral
why
go
in
like
a
mighty
rushing
wind
bustle
do
give
a
moment
rest
or
time
to
think
or
anything
why
if
i
given
aunt
elizabeth
time
to
think
where
should
we
have
been
not
at
combe
regis
together
i
bet
you
heard
that
letter
and
know
what
she
thinks
of
me
now
on
reflection
if
i
gone
slow
and
played
a
timid
she
have
thought
that
before
i
married
millie
instead
of
afterwards
i
give
you
my
honest
word
laddie
that
there
was
a
time
towards
the
middle
of
our
acquaintance
after
she
had
stopped
mixing
me
up
with
the
man
who
came
to
wind
the
clocks
when
that
woman
ate
out
of
my
hand
twice
on
two
separate
occasions
she
actually
asked
my
advice
about
feeding
her
toy
pomeranian
well
that
shows
you
bustle
laddie
bustle
ukridge
i
said
you
inspire
me
you
would
inspire
a
caterpillar
i
will
go
to
the
professor
i
was
going
anyhow
but
now
i
shall
go
aggressively
i
will
prise
a
father
blessing
out
of
him
if
i
have
to
do
it
with
a
crowbar
that
the
way
to
talk
old
horse
do
beat
about
the
bush
tell
him
exactly
what
you
want
and
stand
no
nonsense
if
you
do
see
what
you
want
in
the
window
ask
for
it
where
did
you
think
of
tackling
him
phyllis
tells
me
that
he
always
goes
for
a
swim
before
breakfast
i
thought
of
going
down
and
waylaying
him
you
could
do
better
by
jove
said
ukridge
suddenly
i
tell
you
what
i
do
laddie
i
would
do
it
for
everybody
but
i
look
on
you
as
a
favourite
son
i
come
with
you
and
help
break
the
ice
what
do
you
be
under
any
delusion
old
horse
said
ukridge
paternally
you
have
got
an
easy
job
in
front
of
you
and
what
you
need
more
than
anything
else
when
you
really
get
down
to
is
a
wise
kindly
man
of
the
world
at
your
elbow
to
whoop
you
on
when
your
nerve
fails
you
and
generally
stand
in
your
corner
and
see
that
you
get
a
fair
show
but
it
rather
an
intimate
business
never
mind
take
my
tip
and
have
me
at
your
side
i
can
say
things
about
you
that
you
would
be
too
modest
to
say
for
yourself
i
can
plead
your
case
laddie
i
can
point
out
in
detail
all
that
the
old
boy
will
be
missing
if
he
gives
you
the
well
that
settled
then
about
eight
morning
what
i
be
there
my
boy
a
swim
will
do
me
good
chapter
xix
asking
papa
reviewing
the
matter
later
i
could
see
that
i
made
one
or
two
blunders
in
my
conduct
of
the
campaign
to
win
over
professor
derrick
in
the
first
place
i
made
a
bad
choice
of
time
and
place
at
the
moment
this
did
not
strike
me
it
is
a
simple
matter
i
reflected
for
a
man
to
pass
another
by
haughtily
and
without
recognition
when
they
meet
on
dry
land
but
when
the
said
man
being
it
should
be
remembered
an
indifferent
swimmer
is
accosted
in
the
water
and
out
of
his
depth
the
feat
becomes
a
hard
one
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
should
have
a
better
chance
with
the
professor
in
the
water
than
out
of
it
my
second
mistake
and
this
was
brought
home
to
me
almost
immediately
was
in
bringing
ukridge
along
not
that
i
really
brought
him
along
it
was
rather
a
case
of
being
unable
to
shake
him
off
when
he
met
me
on
the
gravel
outside
the
house
at
a
quarter
to
eight
on
the
following
morning
clad
in
a
dingy
mackintosh
which
swinging
open
revealed
a
purple
i
confess
that
my
heart
sank
unfortunately
all
my
efforts
to
dissuade
him
from
accompanying
me
were
attributed
by
him
to
a
pardonable
nervousness
or
as
he
put
it
to
the
needle
buck
up
laddie
he
roared
encouragingly
i
had
anticipated
this
something
seemed
to
tell
me
that
your
nerve
would
go
when
it
came
to
the
point
you
deuced
lucky
old
horse
to
have
a
man
like
me
at
your
side
why
if
you
were
alone
you
would
have
a
word
to
say
for
yourself
you
just
gape
at
the
man
and
yammer
but
i
with
you
laddie
i
with
you
if
your
flow
of
conversation
dries
up
count
on
me
to
keep
the
thing
going
and
so
it
came
about
that
having
reached
the
cob
and
spying
in
the
distance
the
grey
head
of
the
professor
bobbing
about
on
the
face
of
the
waters
we
dived
in
and
swam
rapidly
towards
him
his
face
was
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
when
we
came
up
with
him
he
was
floating
peacefully
on
his
back
and
it
was
plain
that
he
had
not
observed
our
approach
for
when
treading
water
easily
in
his
rear
i
wished
him
good
morning
in
my
most
conciliatory
tone
he
stood
not
upon
the
order
of
his
sinking
but
went
under
like
so
much
i
waited
courteously
until
he
rose
to
the
surface
again
when
i
repeated
my
remark
he
expelled
the
last
remnant
of
water
from
his
mouth
with
a
wrathful
splutter
and
cleared
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hand
i
confess
to
a
slight
feeling
of
apprehension
as
i
met
his
gaze
nor
was
my
uneasiness
diminished
by
the
spectacle
of
ukridge
splashing
tactfully
in
the
background
like
a
large
seal
ukridge
so
far
had
made
no
remarks
he
had
dived
in
very
flat
and
i
imagine
that
his
breath
had
not
yet
returned
to
him
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
intends
to
get
used
to
his
surroundings
before
trusting
himself
to
speech
the
water
is
delightfully
warm
i
said
oh
it
you
said
the
professor
and
i
could
not
cheat
myself
into
the
belief
that
he
spoke
cordially
ukridge
snorted
loudly
in
the
offing
the
professor
turned
sharply
as
if
anxious
to
observe
this
marine
phenomenon
and
the
annoyed
gurgle
which
he
gave
showed
that
he
was
not
approving
of
ukridge
either
i
did
not
approve
of
ukridge
myself
i
wished
he
had
not
come
ukridge
in
the
water
lacks
dignity
i
felt
that
he
prejudiced
my
case
you
are
swimming
splendidly
this
morning
i
went
on
perseveringly
feeling
that
an
ounce
of
flattery
is
worth
a
pound
of
rhetoric
if
i
added
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
i
will
not
he
snapped
i
here
a
small
wave
noticing
that
his
mouth
was
open
stepped
in
i
wish
he
resumed
warmly
as
i
said
in
me
letter
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
i
consider
that
behaved
in
a
manner
that
can
only
be
described
as
abominable
and
i
will
thank
you
to
leave
me
alone
but
allow
me
i
will
not
allow
ye
sir
i
will
allow
ye
nothing
is
it
not
enough
to
make
me
the
the
butt
sir
of
this
town
without
pursuing
me
in
this
way
when
i
wish
to
enjoy
a
quiet
swim
now
laddie
laddie
said
ukridge
placing
a
large
hand
on
his
shoulder
these
are
harsh
words
be
reasonable
think
before
you
speak
you
little
know
go
to
the
devil
said
the
professor
i
wish
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
either
of
you
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
cease
this
persecution
persecution
sir
his
remarks
which
i
have
placed
on
paper
as
if
they
were
continuous
and
uninterrupted
were
punctuated
in
reality
by
a
series
of
gasps
and
puffings
as
he
received
and
rejected
the
successors
of
the
wave
he
had
swallowed
at
the
beginning
of
our
little
chat
the
art
of
conducting
conversation
while
in
the
water
is
not
given
to
every
swimmer
this
he
seemed
to
realise
for
as
if
to
close
the
interview
he
proceeded
to
make
his
way
as
quickly
as
he
could
to
the
shore
unfortunately
his
first
dash
brought
him
squarely
up
against
ukridge
who
not
having
expected
the
collision
clutched
wildly
at
him
and
took
him
below
the
surface
again
they
came
up
a
moment
later
on
the
worst
terms
are
you
trying
to
drown
me
sir
barked
the
professor
my
dear
old
horse
said
ukridge
complainingly
it
a
little
hard
you
might
look
where
you
going
you
grappled
with
me
you
took
me
by
surprise
laddie
rid
yourself
of
the
impression
that
you
playing
but
professor
i
said
joining
the
group
and
treading
water
one
moment
i
was
growing
annoyed
with
the
man
i
could
have
ducked
him
but
for
the
reflection
that
my
prospects
of
obtaining
his
consent
to
my
engagement
would
scarcely
have
been
enhanced
thereby
but
professor
i
said
one
moment
go
away
sir
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
but
he
has
lots
to
say
to
you
said
ukridge
now
the
time
old
horse
he
added
encouragingly
to
me
spill
the
news
without
preamble
i
gave
out
the
text
of
my
address
i
love
your
daughter
phyllis
derrick
she
loves
me
in
fact
we
are
engaged
devilish
well
put
laddie
said
ukridge
approvingly
the
professor
went
under
as
if
he
had
been
seized
with
cramp
it
was
a
little
trying
having
to
argue
with
a
man
of
whom
one
could
not
predict
with
certainty
that
at
any
given
moment
he
would
not
be
under
water
it
tended
to
spoil
the
flow
of
one
eloquence
the
best
of
arguments
is
useless
if
the
listener
suddenly
disappears
in
the
middle
of
it
stick
to
it
old
horse
said
ukridge
i
think
you
going
to
bring
it
off
i
stuck
to
it
derrick
i
said
as
his
head
emerged
you
are
naturally
surprised
you
would
be
said
ukridge
we
do
blame
you
he
added
handsomely
you
you
you
so
far
from
cooling
the
professor
liberal
doses
of
water
seemed
to
make
him
more
heated
you
impudent
scoundrel
my
reply
was
more
gentlemanly
more
courteous
on
a
higher
plane
altogether
i
said
winningly
can
not
we
let
bygones
be
bygones
from
his
remarks
i
gathered
that
we
could
not
i
continued
i
was
under
the
unfortunate
necessity
of
having
to
condense
my
speech
i
was
not
able
to
let
myself
go
as
i
could
have
wished
for
time
was
an
important
consideration
ere
long
swallowing
water
at
his
present
rate
the
professor
must
inevitably
become
waterlogged
i
have
loved
your
daughter
i
said
rapidly
ever
since
i
first
saw
her
and
he
a
capital
chap
interjected
ukridge
one
of
the
best
known
him
for
years
you
like
him
i
learned
last
night
that
she
loved
me
but
she
will
not
marry
me
without
your
consent
stretch
your
arms
out
straight
from
the
shoulders
and
fill
your
lungs
well
and
you
ca
sink
so
i
have
come
this
morning
to
ask
for
your
consent
give
it
advised
ukridge
could
do
better
a
very
sound
fellow
pots
of
money
too
at
least
he
will
have
when
he
marries
i
know
we
have
not
been
on
the
best
of
terms
lately
for
heaven
sake
do
try
to
talk
or
you
sink
the
fault
i
said
generously
was
mine
well
put
said
ukridge
but
when
you
have
heard
my
explanation
i
am
sure
you
will
forgive
me
there
i
told
you
so
he
reappeared
some
few
feet
to
the
left
i
swam
up
and
resumed
when
you
left
us
so
abruptly
after
our
little
come
again
some
night
said
ukridge
cordially
any
time
passing
you
put
me
in
a
very
awkward
position
i
was
desperately
in
love
with
your
daughter
and
as
long
as
you
were
in
the
frame
of
mind
in
which
you
left
i
could
not
hope
to
find
an
opportunity
of
revealing
my
feelings
to
her
revealing
feelings
is
good
said
ukridge
approvingly
neat
you
see
what
a
fix
i
was
in
do
you
keep
your
arms
well
out
i
thought
for
hours
and
hours
to
try
and
find
some
means
of
bringing
about
a
reconciliation
you
would
believe
how
hard
i
thought
got
as
thin
as
a
corkscrew
said
ukridge
at
last
seeing
you
fishing
one
morning
when
i
was
on
the
cob
it
struck
me
all
of
a
sudden
you
know
how
it
is
said
ukridge
all
of
a
sudden
that
the
very
best
way
would
be
to
arrange
a
little
boating
accident
i
was
confident
that
i
could
rescue
you
all
right
here
i
paused
and
he
seized
the
opportunity
to
curse
me
briefly
with
a
wary
eye
on
an
incoming
wavelet
if
it
had
been
for
the
inscrutable
workings
of
providence
which
has
a
mania
for
upsetting
everything
all
would
have
been
well
in
fact
all
was
well
till
you
found
out
always
the
way
said
ukridge
sadly
always
the
way
you
young
blackguard
he
managed
to
slip
past
me
and
made
for
the
shore
look
at
the
thing
from
the
standpoint
of
a
philosopher
old
horse
urged
ukridge
splashing
after
him
the
fact
that
the
rescue
was
arranged
ought
to
matter
i
mean
to
say
you
did
know
it
at
the
time
so
relatively
it
was
not
and
you
were
genuinely
saved
from
a
watery
grave
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
had
not
imagined
ukridge
capable
of
such
an
excursion
into
metaphysics
i
saw
the
truth
of
his
line
of
argument
so
clearly
that
it
seemed
to
me
impossible
for
anyone
else
to
get
confused
over
it
i
had
certainly
pulled
the
professor
out
of
the
water
and
the
fact
that
i
had
first
caused
him
to
be
pushed
in
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
either
a
man
is
a
gallant
rescuer
or
he
is
not
a
gallant
rescuer
there
is
no
middle
course
i
had
saved
his
life
for
he
would
certainly
have
drowned
if
left
to
himself
and
i
was
entitled
to
his
gratitude
that
was
all
there
was
to
be
said
about
it
these
things
both
ukridge
and
i
tried
to
make
plain
as
we
swam
along
but
whether
it
was
that
the
salt
water
he
had
swallowed
had
dulled
the
professor
normally
keen
intelligence
or
that
our
power
of
stating
a
case
was
too
weak
the
fact
remains
that
he
reached
the
beach
an
unconvinced
man
then
may
i
consider
i
said
that
your
objections
are
removed
i
have
your
consent
he
stamped
angrily
and
his
bare
foot
came
down
on
a
small
sharp
pebble
with
a
brief
exclamation
he
seized
his
foot
in
one
hand
and
hopped
up
the
beach
while
hopping
he
delivered
his
ultimatum
probably
the
only
instance
on
record
of
a
father
adopting
this
attitude
in
dismissing
a
suitor
you
may
not
he
cried
you
may
consider
no
such
thing
my
objections
were
never
more
absolute
you
detain
me
in
the
water
sir
till
i
am
blue
sir
blue
with
cold
in
order
to
listen
to
the
most
preposterous
and
impudent
nonsense
i
ever
heard
this
was
unjust
if
he
had
listened
attentively
from
the
first
and
avoided
interruptions
and
had
not
behaved
like
a
submarine
we
should
have
got
through
the
business
in
half
the
time
i
said
so
do
talk
to
me
sir
he
replied
hobbling
off
to
his
i
will
not
listen
to
you
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
i
consider
you
impudent
sir
i
assure
you
it
was
unintentional
isch
he
said
being
the
first
occasion
and
the
last
on
which
i
have
ever
heard
that
remarkable
monosyllable
proceed
from
the
mouth
of
a
man
and
he
vanished
into
his
tent

chapter

scientific
golf
people
are
continually
writing
to
the
papers
or
it
may
be
one
solitary
enthusiast
who
writes
under
a
number
of
pseudonyms
on
the
subject
of
sport
and
the
of
the
same
by
the
modern
young
man
i
recall
one
letter
in
which
efficiency
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
if
the
young
man
played
less
golf
and
did
more
drill
he
would
be
all
the
better
for
it
i
propose
to
report
my
doings
with
the
professor
on
the
links
at
some
length
in
order
to
refute
this
absurd
view
everybody
ought
to
play
golf
and
nobody
can
begin
it
too
soon
there
ought
not
to
be
a
single
infant
in
the
british
isles
who
has
not
foozled
a
drive
to
take
my
case
suppose
i
had
employed
in
drilling
the
hours
i
had
spent
in
learning
to
handle
my
clubs
i
might
have
drilled
before
the
professor
by
the
week
without
softening
his
heart
i
might
have
ported
arms
and
grounded
arms
and
presented
arms
and
generally
behaved
in
the
manner
advocated
by
efficiency
and
what
would
have
been
the
result
indifference
on
his
part
or
and
if
i
overdid
the
thing
irritation
whereas
by
devoting
a
reasonable
portion
of
my
youth
to
learning
the
intricacies
of
golf
i
was
enabled
it
happened
in
this
way
to
me
as
i
stood
with
ukridge
in
the
in
the
morning
following
my
maritime
conversation
with
the
professor
regarding
a
hen
that
had
posed
before
us
obviously
with
a
view
to
inspection
there
appeared
a
man
carrying
an
envelope
ukridge
who
by
this
time
saw
as
calverley
almost
said
under
every
hat
a
dun
and
imagined
that
no
envelope
could
contain
anything
but
a
small
account
softly
and
silently
vanished
away
leaving
me
to
interview
the
enemy
garnet
sir
said
the
foe
i
recognised
him
he
was
professor
derrick
gardener
i
opened
the
envelope
no
father
blessings
were
absent
the
letter
was
in
the
third
person
professor
derrick
begged
to
inform
garnet
that
by
defeating
saul
potter
he
had
qualified
for
the
final
round
of
the
combe
regis
golf
tournament
in
which
he
understood
garnet
was
to
be
his
opponent
if
it
would
be
convenient
for
garnet
to
play
off
the
match
on
the
present
afternoon
professor
derrick
would
be
obliged
if
he
would
be
at
the
club
house
at
two
if
this
hour
and
day
were
unsuitable
would
he
kindly
arrange
others
the
bearer
would
wait
the
bearer
did
wait
he
waited
for
as
i
found
it
impossible
to
shift
him
not
caring
to
use
violence
on
a
man
well
stricken
in
years
without
first
plying
him
with
drink
he
absorbed
more
of
our
diminishing
cask
of
beer
than
we
could
conveniently
spare
and
then
trudged
off
with
a
note
beautifully
written
in
the
third
person
in
which
garnet
after
numerous
compliments
and
thanks
begged
to
inform
professor
derrick
that
he
would
be
at
the
club
house
at
the
hour
mentioned
and
i
added
to
myself
not
in
the
note
i
will
give
him
such
a
licking
that
he
brain
himself
with
a
cleek
for
i
was
not
pleased
with
the
professor
i
was
conscious
of
a
malicious
joy
at
the
prospect
of
snatching
the
prize
from
him
i
knew
he
had
set
his
heart
on
winning
the
tournament
this
year
to
be
two
years
in
succession
stimulates
the
desire
for
first
place
it
would
be
doubly
bitter
to
him
to
be
beaten
by
a
newcomer
after
the
absence
of
his
rival
the
colonel
had
awakened
hope
in
him
and
i
knew
i
could
do
it
even
allowing
for
bad
luck
and
i
am
never
a
very
unlucky
golfer
i
could
rely
almost
with
certainty
on
crushing
the
man
and
i
do
it
i
said
to
bob
who
had
trotted
up
i
often
make
bob
the
recipient
of
my
confidences
he
listens
appreciatively
and
never
interrupts
and
he
never
has
grievances
of
his
own
if
there
is
one
person
i
dislike
it
is
the
man
who
tries
to
air
his
grievances
when
i
wish
to
air
mine
bob
i
said
running
his
tail
through
my
fingers
listen
to
me
my
old
university
chum
for
i
have
matured
a
dark
scheme
do
run
away
you
know
you
do
really
want
to
go
and
look
at
that
chicken
listen
to
me
if
i
am
in
form
this
afternoon
and
i
feel
in
my
bones
that
i
shall
be
i
shall
nurse
the
professor
i
shall
play
with
him
do
you
understand
the
principles
of
match
play
at
golf
robert
you
score
by
holes
not
strokes
there
are
eighteen
holes
all
right
how
was
to
know
that
you
knew
that
without
my
telling
you
well
if
you
understand
so
much
about
the
game
you
will
appreciate
my
dark
scheme
i
shall
toy
with
the
professor
bob
i
shall
let
him
get
ahead
and
then
catch
him
up
i
shall
go
ahead
myself
and
let
him
catch
me
up
i
shall
race
him
neck
and
neck
till
the
very
end
then
when
his
hair
has
turned
white
with
the
strain
and
he
lost
a
couple
of
stone
in
weight
and
his
eyes
are
starting
out
of
his
head
and
he
praying
if
he
ever
does
pray
to
the
gods
of
golf
that
he
may
be
allowed
to
win
i
shall
go
ahead
and
beat
him
by
a
hole
teach
him
robert
he
shall
taste
of
my
despair
and
learn
by
proof
in
some
wild
hour
how
much
the
wretched
dare
and
when
it
all
over
and
he
torn
all
his
hair
out
and
smashed
all
his
clubs
i
shall
go
and
commit
suicide
off
the
cob
because
you
see
if
i
ca
marry
phyllis
i
sha
have
any
use
for
life
bob
wagged
his
tail
cheerfully
i
mean
it
i
said
rolling
him
on
his
back
and
punching
him
on
the
chest
till
his
breathing
became
stertorous
you
do
see
the
sense
of
it
i
know
but
then
you
got
none
of
the
finer
feelings
you
a
jolly
good
dog
robert
but
you
a
rank
materialist
bones
and
cheese
and
potatoes
with
gravy
over
them
make
you
happy
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
in
love
you
better
get
right
side
up
now
or
you
have
apoplexy
it
has
been
my
aim
in
the
course
of
this
narrative
to
extenuate
nothing
nor
set
down
aught
in
malice
like
the
gentleman
who
played
euchre
with
the
heathen
chinee
i
state
but
facts
i
do
not
therefore
slur
over
my
scheme
for
disturbing
the
professor
peace
of
mind
i
am
not
always
good
and
noble
i
am
the
hero
of
this
story
but
i
have
my
off
moments
i
felt
ruthless
towards
the
professor
i
can
not
plead
ignorance
of
the
golfer
point
of
view
as
an
excuse
for
my
plottings
i
knew
that
to
one
whose
soul
is
in
the
game
as
the
professor
was
the
agony
of
being
just
beaten
in
an
important
match
exceeds
in
bitterness
all
other
agonies
i
knew
that
if
i
scraped
through
by
the
smallest
possible
margin
his
appetite
would
be
destroyed
his
sleep
o
nights
broken
he
would
wake
from
fitful
slumber
moaning
that
if
he
had
only
used
his
iron
instead
of
his
mashie
at
the
tenth
all
would
have
been
well
that
if
he
had
putted
more
carefully
on
the
seventh
green
life
would
not
be
drear
and
blank
that
a
more
judicious
manipulation
of
his
brassey
throughout
might
have
given
him
something
to
live
for
all
these
things
i
knew
and
they
did
not
touch
me
i
was
adamant
the
professor
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
club
house
and
greeted
me
with
a
cold
and
stately
inclination
of
the
head
beautiful
day
for
golf
i
observed
in
my
gay
chatty
manner
he
bowed
in
silence
very
well
i
thought
wait
just
wait
miss
derrick
is
well
i
hope
i
added
aloud
that
drew
him
he
started
his
aspect
became
doubly
forbidding
miss
derrick
is
perfectly
well
sir
i
thank
you
and
you
no
bad
effect
i
hope
from
your
dip
yesterday
garnet
i
came
here
for
golf
not
conversation
he
said
we
made
it
so
i
drove
off
from
the
first
tee
it
was
a
splendid
drive
i
should
not
say
so
if
there
were
any
one
else
to
say
so
for
me
modesty
would
forbid
but
as
there
is
no
one
i
must
repeat
the
statement
it
was
one
of
the
best
drives
of
my
experience
the
ball
flashed
through
the
air
took
the
bunker
with
a
dozen
feet
to
spare
and
rolled
on
to
the
green
i
had
felt
all
along
that
i
should
be
in
form
unless
my
opponent
was
equally
above
himself
he
was
a
lost
man
i
could
toy
with
him
the
excellence
of
my
drive
had
not
been
without
its
effect
on
the
professor
i
could
see
that
he
was
not
confident
he
addressed
his
ball
more
strangely
and
at
greater
length
than
any
one
i
had
ever
seen
he
waggled
his
club
over
it
as
if
he
were
going
to
perform
a
conjuring
trick
then
he
struck
and
topped
it
the
ball
rolled
two
yards
he
looked
at
it
in
silence
then
he
looked
at
me
also
in
silence
i
was
gazing
seawards
when
i
looked
round
he
was
getting
to
work
with
a
brassey
this
time
he
hit
the
bunker
and
rolled
back
he
repeated
this
manoeuvre
twice
hard
luck
i
murmured
sympathetically
on
the
third
occasion
thereby
going
as
near
to
being
slain
with
a
niblick
as
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
go
your
true
golfer
is
easily
roused
in
times
of
misfortune
and
there
was
a
red
gleam
in
the
eye
of
the
professor
turned
to
me
i
shall
pick
my
ball
up
he
growled
we
walked
on
in
silence
to
the
second
tee
he
did
the
second
hole
in
four
which
was
good
i
did
it
in
three
which
unfortunately
for
him
was
better
i
won
the
third
hole
i
won
the
fourth
hole
i
won
the
fifth
hole
i
glanced
at
my
opponent
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eyes
the
man
was
suffering
beads
of
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
forehead
his
play
had
become
wilder
and
wilder
at
each
hole
in
arithmetical
progression
if
he
had
been
a
plough
he
could
hardly
have
turned
up
more
soil
the
imagination
recoiled
from
the
thought
of
what
he
could
be
doing
in
another
if
he
deteriorated
at
his
present
speed
a
feeling
of
calm
and
content
stole
over
me
i
was
not
sorry
for
him
all
the
viciousness
of
my
nature
was
uppermost
in
me
once
when
he
missed
the
ball
clean
at
the
fifth
tee
his
eye
met
mine
and
we
stood
staring
at
each
other
for
a
full
without
moving
i
believe
if
i
had
smiled
then
he
would
have
attacked
me
without
hesitation
there
is
a
type
of
golfer
who
really
almost
ceases
to
be
human
under
stress
of
the
wild
agony
of
a
series
of
foozles
the
sixth
hole
involves
the
player
in
a
somewhat
tricky
piece
of
work
owing
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
nasty
ditch
to
be
negotiated
some
fifty
yards
from
the
green
it
is
a
beast
of
a
ditch
which
if
you
are
out
of
luck
just
catches
your
second
shot
all
hope
abandon
ye
who
enter
here
might
be
written
on
a
notice
board
over
it
the
professor
entered
there
the
unhappy
man
sent
his
second
as
nice
and
clean
a
brassey
shot
as
he
had
made
all
day
into
its
very
jaws
and
then
madness
seized
him
a
merciful
local
rule
framed
by
kindly
men
who
have
been
in
that
ditch
themselves
enacts
that
in
such
a
case
the
player
may
take
his
ball
and
throw
it
over
his
shoulder
losing
a
stroke
but
once
so
the
legend
runs
a
scratch
man
who
found
himself
trapped
scorning
to
avail
himself
of
this
rule
at
the
expense
of
its
accompanying
penalty
wrought
so
shrewdly
with
his
niblick
that
he
not
only
got
out
but
actually
laid
his
ball
dead
and
now
optimists
sometimes
imitate
his
gallantry
though
no
one
yet
has
been
able
to
imitate
his
success
the
professor
decided
to
take
a
chance
and
he
failed
miserably
as
i
was
on
the
green
with
my
third
and
unless
i
putted
extremely
poorly
was
morally
certain
to
be
down
in
five
which
is
bogey
for
the
hole
there
was
not
much
practical
use
in
his
continuing
to
struggle
but
he
did
in
a
spirit
of
pure
vindictiveness
as
if
he
were
trying
to
take
it
out
of
the
ball
it
was
a
grisly
sight
to
see
him
head
and
shoulders
above
the
ditch
hewing
at
his
obstinate
colonel
it
was
a
similar
spectacle
that
once
induced
a
lay
spectator
of
a
golf
match
to
observe
that
he
considered
hockey
a
silly
game
said
the
professor
between
his
teeth
then
he
picked
up
his
ball
i
won
the
seventh
hole
i
won
the
eighth
hole
the
ninth
we
halved
for
in
the
black
depths
of
my
soul
i
had
formed
a
plan
of
fiendish
subtlety
i
intended
to
allow
him
to
win
with
extreme
labour
eight
holes
in
succession
then
when
hope
was
once
more
strong
in
him
i
would
win
the
last
and
he
would
go
mad
i
watched
him
carefully
as
we
trudged
on
emotions
chased
one
another
across
his
face
when
he
won
the
tenth
hole
he
merely
refrained
from
oaths
when
he
won
the
eleventh
a
sort
of
sullen
pleasure
showed
in
his
face
it
was
at
the
thirteenth
that
i
detected
the
first
dawning
of
hope
from
then
onward
it
grew
when
with
a
sequence
of
shocking
shots
he
took
the
seventeenth
hole
in
seven
he
was
in
a
parlous
condition
his
run
of
success
had
engendered
within
him
a
desire
for
conversation
he
wanted
as
it
were
to
flap
his
wings
and
crow
i
could
see
dignity
wrestling
with
talkativeness
i
gave
him
the
lead
you
have
got
your
form
now
i
said
talkativeness
had
it
dignity
retired
hurt
speech
came
from
him
in
a
rush
when
he
brought
off
an
excellent
drive
from
the
eighteenth
tee
he
seemed
to
forget
everything
me
dear
boy
he
began
and
stopped
abruptly
in
some
confusion
silence
once
more
brooded
over
us
as
we
played
ourselves
up
the
fairway
and
on
to
the
green
he
was
on
the
green
in
four
i
reached
it
in
three
his
sixth
stroke
took
him
out
i
putted
carefully
to
the
very
mouth
of
the
hole
i
walked
up
to
my
ball
and
paused
i
looked
at
the
professor
he
looked
at
me
go
on
he
said
hoarsely
suddenly
a
wave
of
compassion
flooded
over
me
what
right
had
i
to
torture
the
man
like
this
professor
i
said
go
on
he
repeated
that
looks
a
simple
shot
i
said
eyeing
him
steadily
but
i
might
miss
it
he
started
and
then
you
would
win
the
championship
he
dabbed
at
his
forehead
with
a
wet
ball
of
a
handkerchief
it
would
be
very
pleasant
for
you
after
getting
so
near
it
the
last
two
years
go
on
he
said
for
the
third
time
but
there
was
a
note
of
hesitation
in
his
voice
sudden
joy
i
said
would
almost
certainly
make
me
miss
it
we
looked
at
each
other
he
had
the
golf
fever
in
his
eyes
if
i
said
slowly
lifting
my
putter
you
were
to
give
your
consent
to
my
marriage
with
phyllis
he
looked
from
me
to
the
ball
from
the
ball
to
me
and
back
to
the
ball
it
was
very
very
near
the
hole
why
not
i
said
he
looked
up
and
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
you
young
devil
said
he
smiting
his
thigh
you
young
devil
beaten
me
on
the
contrary
i
said
you
have
beaten
me
i
left
the
professor
at
the
club
house
and
raced
back
to
the
farm
i
wanted
to
pour
my
joys
into
a
sympathetic
ear
ukridge
i
knew
would
offer
that
same
sympathetic
ear
a
good
fellow
ukridge
always
interested
in
what
you
had
to
tell
him
never
bored
ukridge
i
shouted
no
answer
i
flung
open
the
door
nobody
i
went
into
the
it
was
empty
i
drew
the
garden
and
his
bedroom
he
was
not
in
either
he
must
have
gone
for
a
stroll
i
said
i
rang
the
bell
the
hired
retainer
appeared
calm
and
imperturbable
as
ever
sir
oh
where
is
ukridge
beale
ukridge
sir
said
the
hired
retainer
nonchalantly
has
gone
gone
yes
sir
ukridge
and
ukridge
went
away
together
by
the
three
train
chapter
xxi
the
calm
before
the
storm
beale
i
said
are
you
drunk
wish
i
was
sir
said
the
hired
man
then
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
gone
where
have
they
gone
to
do
know
sir
london
i
expect
london
why
do
know
sir
when
did
they
go
oh
you
told
me
that
did
they
say
why
they
were
going
no
sir
did
you
ask
when
you
saw
them
packing
up
and
going
to
the
station
did
you
do
anything
no
sir
why
on
earth
not
i
did
see
them
sir
i
only
found
out
as
they
gone
after
been
and
went
sir
walking
down
by
the
net
and
mackerel
met
one
of
them
coastguards
says
he
you
moving
i
says
to
him
he
says
to
me
seen
your
ukridge
and
his
missus
get
into
the
three
train
for
axminster
i
thought
as
you
was
all
i
says
wondering
and
i
goes
on
when
i
gets
back
i
asks
the
missus
did
she
see
them
packing
their
boxes
and
she
says
no
she
says
they
did
pack
no
boxes
as
she
knowed
of
and
blowed
if
they
had
garnet
sir
what
they
did
pack
no
sir
we
looked
at
one
another
beale
i
said
sir
do
you
know
what
i
think
yes
sir
they
bolted
so
i
says
to
the
missus
sir
it
struck
me
right
off
in
a
manner
of
speaking
this
is
awful
i
said
yes
sir
his
face
betrayed
no
emotion
but
he
was
one
of
those
men
whose
expression
never
varies
it
a
way
they
have
in
the
army
this
wants
thinking
out
beale
i
said
yes
sir
you
better
ask
beale
to
give
me
some
dinner
and
then
think
it
over
yes
sir
i
was
in
an
unpleasant
position
ukridge
by
his
defection
had
left
me
in
charge
of
the
farm
i
could
dissolve
the
concern
i
supposed
if
i
wished
and
return
to
london
but
i
particularly
desired
to
remain
in
combe
regis
to
complete
the
victory
i
had
won
on
the
links
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
continue
as
i
had
begun
i
was
in
the
position
of
a
general
who
has
conquered
a
hostile
country
and
is
obliged
to
soothe
the
feelings
of
the
conquered
people
before
his
labours
can
be
considered
at
an
end
i
had
rushed
the
professor
it
must
now
be
my
aim
to
keep
him
from
regretting
that
he
had
been
rushed
i
must
therefore
stick
to
my
post
with
the
tenacity
of
an
leech
there
would
be
trouble
of
that
i
was
certain
as
soon
as
the
news
got
about
that
ukridge
had
gone
the
deluge
would
begin
his
creditors
would
abandon
their
passive
tactics
and
take
active
steps
there
was
a
chance
that
aggressive
measures
would
be
confined
to
the
enemy
at
our
gates
the
tradesmen
of
combe
regis
but
the
probability
was
that
the
news
would
spread
and
the
injured
merchants
of
dorchester
and
axminster
rush
to
the
scene
of
hostilities
i
summoned
beale
after
dinner
and
held
a
council
of
war
it
was
no
time
for
airy
persiflage
i
said
beale
we
in
the
cart
sir
ukridge
going
away
like
this
has
left
me
in
a
most
unpleasant
position
i
would
like
to
talk
it
over
with
you
i
daresay
you
know
that
we
that
ukridge
owes
a
considerable
amount
of
money
round
about
here
to
tradesmen
yes
sir
well
when
they
find
out
that
he
has
er
shot
the
moon
sir
suggested
the
hired
retainer
helpfully
gone
up
to
town
i
amended
when
they
find
out
that
he
has
gone
up
to
town
they
are
likely
to
come
bothering
us
a
good
deal
yes
sir
i
fancy
that
we
shall
have
them
all
round
here
news
of
this
sort
always
spreads
quickly
the
point
is
then
what
are
we
to
do
he
propounded
no
scheme
but
stood
in
an
easy
attitude
of
attention
waiting
for
me
to
continue
i
continued
let
see
exactly
how
we
stand
i
said
my
point
is
that
i
particularly
wish
to
go
on
living
down
here
for
at
least
another
fortnight
of
course
my
position
is
simple
i
am
ukridge
guest
i
shall
go
on
living
as
i
have
been
doing
up
to
the
present
he
asked
me
down
here
to
help
him
look
after
the
fowls
so
i
shall
go
on
looking
after
them
complications
set
in
when
we
come
to
consider
you
and
beale
i
suppose
you
wo
care
to
stop
on
after
this
the
hired
retainer
scratched
his
chin
and
glanced
out
of
the
window
the
moon
was
up
and
the
garden
looked
cool
and
mysterious
in
the
dim
light
it
a
pretty
place
garnet
sir
he
said
it
is
i
said
but
about
other
considerations
there
the
matter
of
wages
are
yours
in
arrears
yes
sir
a
month
and
beale
the
same
i
suppose
yes
sir
a
month
h
well
it
seems
to
me
beale
you
ca
lose
anything
by
stopping
on
i
ca
be
paid
any
less
than
i
have
bin
sir
he
agreed
exactly
and
as
you
say
it
a
pretty
place
you
might
just
as
well
stop
on
and
help
me
in
the
what
do
you
think
very
well
sir
and
beale
will
do
the
same
yes
sir
that
excellent
you
a
hero
beale
i
sha
forget
you
there
a
cheque
coming
to
me
from
a
magazine
in
another
week
for
a
short
story
when
it
arrives
i
look
into
that
matter
of
back
wages
tell
beale
i
much
obliged
to
her
will
you
yes
sir
having
concluded
that
delicate
business
i
lit
my
pipe
and
strolled
out
into
the
garden
with
bob
i
cursed
ukridge
as
i
walked
it
was
abominable
of
him
to
desert
me
in
this
way
even
if
i
had
not
been
his
friend
it
would
have
been
bad
the
fact
that
we
had
known
each
other
for
years
made
it
doubly
discreditable
he
might
at
least
have
warned
me
and
given
me
the
option
of
leaving
the
sinking
ship
with
him
but
i
reflected
i
ought
not
to
be
surprised
his
whole
career
as
long
as
i
had
known
him
had
been
dotted
with
little
eccentricities
of
a
type
which
an
unfeeling
world
generally
stigmatises
as
shady
they
were
small
things
it
was
true
but
they
ought
to
have
warned
me
we
are
most
of
us
wise
after
the
event
when
the
wind
has
blown
we
can
generally
discover
a
multitude
of
straws
which
should
have
shown
us
which
way
it
was
blowing
once
i
remembered
in
our
schoolmaster
days
when
guineas
though
regular
were
few
he
had
had
occasion
to
increase
his
wardrobe
if
i
recollect
rightly
he
thought
he
had
a
chance
of
a
good
position
in
the
tutoring
line
and
only
needed
good
clothes
to
make
it
his
he
took
four
pounds
of
his
salary
in
advance
he
was
in
the
habit
of
doing
this
he
never
had
any
salary
left
by
the
end
of
term
it
having
vanished
in
advance
loans
beforehand
with
this
he
was
to
buy
two
suits
a
hat
new
boots
and
collars
when
it
came
to
making
the
purchases
he
found
what
he
had
overlooked
previously
in
his
optimistic
way
that
four
pounds
did
not
go
very
far
at
the
time
i
remember
i
thought
his
method
of
grappling
with
the
situation
humorous
he
bought
a
hat
for
and
got
the
suits
and
the
boots
on
the
instalment
system
paying
a
small
sum
in
advance
as
earnest
of
more
to
come
he
then
pawned
one
suit
to
pay
for
the
first
few
instalments
and
finally
departed
to
be
known
no
more
his
address
he
had
given
with
a
false
name
at
an
empty
house
and
when
the
tailor
arrived
with
his
minions
of
the
law
all
he
found
was
an
annoyed
caretaker
and
a
pile
of
letters
written
by
himself
containing
his
bill
in
its
various
stages
of
evolution
or
again
there
was
a
bicycle
and
photograph
shop
near
the
school
he
went
into
this
one
day
and
his
roving
eye
fell
on
a
tandem
bicycle
he
did
not
want
a
tandem
bicycle
but
that
influenced
him
not
at
all
he
ordered
it
provisionally
he
also
ordered
an
enlarging
camera
a
kodak
and
a
magic
lantern
the
order
was
booked
and
the
goods
were
to
be
delivered
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
concerning
them
after
a
week
the
shopman
sent
round
to
ask
if
there
were
any
further
particulars
which
ukridge
would
like
to
learn
before
definitely
ordering
them
ukridge
sent
back
word
that
he
was
considering
the
matter
and
that
in
the
meantime
would
he
be
so
good
as
to
let
him
have
that
little
clockwork
man
in
his
window
which
walked
when
wound
up
having
got
this
and
not
paid
for
it
ukridge
thought
that
he
had
done
handsomely
by
the
bicycle
and
photograph
man
and
that
things
were
square
between
them
the
latter
met
him
a
few
days
afterwards
and
expostulated
plaintively
ukridge
explained
my
good
man
he
said
you
know
i
really
think
we
need
say
no
more
about
the
matter
really
you
come
out
of
it
very
well
now
look
here
which
would
you
rather
be
owed
for
a
clockwork
man
which
is
broken
and
you
can
have
it
back
or
a
tandem
bicycle
an
enlarging
camera
a
kodak
and
a
what
his
reasoning
was
too
subtle
for
the
uneducated
mind
the
man
retired
puzzled
and
unpaid
and
ukridge
kept
the
clockwork
toy
chapter
xxii
the
storm
breaks
rather
to
my
surprise
the
next
morning
passed
off
uneventfully
our
knocker
advertised
no
dun
our
lawn
remained
untrodden
by
boots
by
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
expected
trouble
would
not
occur
that
day
and
i
felt
that
i
might
well
leave
my
post
for
the
afternoon
while
i
went
to
the
professor
to
pay
my
respects
the
professor
was
out
when
i
arrived
phyllis
was
in
and
it
was
not
till
the
evening
that
i
started
for
the
farm
again
as
i
approached
the
sound
of
voices
smote
my
ears
i
stopped
i
could
hear
beale
speaking
then
came
the
rich
notes
of
vickers
the
butcher
then
beale
again
then
dawlish
the
grocer
then
a
chorus
the
storm
had
burst
and
in
my
absence
i
blushed
for
myself
i
was
in
command
and
i
had
deserted
the
fort
in
time
of
need
what
must
the
faithful
hired
man
be
thinking
of
me
probably
he
placed
me
as
he
had
placed
ukridge
in
the
ragged
ranks
of
those
who
have
shot
the
moon
fortunately
having
just
come
from
the
professor
i
was
in
the
costume
which
of
all
my
wardrobe
was
most
calculated
to
impress
to
a
casual
observer
i
should
probably
suggest
wealth
and
respectability
i
stopped
for
a
moment
to
cool
myself
for
as
is
my
habit
when
pleased
with
life
i
had
been
walking
fast
then
opened
the
gate
and
strode
in
trying
to
look
as
opulent
as
possible
it
was
an
animated
scene
that
met
my
eyes
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
stood
the
devoted
beale
a
little
more
flushed
than
i
had
seen
him
hitherto
parleying
with
a
burly
and
excited
young
man
without
a
coat
grouped
round
the
pair
were
some
dozen
men
young
and
old
all
talking
their
hardest
i
could
distinguish
nothing
of
what
they
were
saying
i
noticed
that
beale
left
cheekbone
was
a
little
discoloured
and
there
was
a
hard
dogged
expression
on
his
face
he
too
was
in
his
my
entry
created
no
sensation
nobody
apparently
had
heard
the
latch
click
and
nobody
had
caught
sight
of
me
their
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
young
man
and
beale
i
stood
at
the
gate
and
watched
them
there
seemed
to
have
been
trouble
already
looking
more
closely
i
perceived
sitting
on
the
grass
apart
a
second
young
man
his
face
was
obscured
by
a
dirty
pocket
handkerchief
with
which
he
dabbed
tenderly
at
his
features
every
now
and
then
the
young
man
flung
his
hand
towards
him
with
an
indignant
gesture
talking
hard
the
while
it
did
not
need
a
preternaturally
keen
observer
to
deduce
what
had
happened
beale
must
have
fallen
out
with
the
young
man
who
was
sitting
on
the
grass
and
smitten
him
and
now
his
friend
had
taken
up
the
quarrel
now
this
i
said
to
myself
is
rather
interesting
here
in
this
one
farm
we
have
the
only
three
known
methods
of
dealing
with
duns
beale
is
evidently
an
exponent
of
the
violent
method
ukridge
is
an
apostle
of
evasion
i
shall
try
conciliation
i
wonder
which
of
us
will
be
the
most
successful
meanwhile
not
to
spoil
beale
efforts
by
allowing
him
too
little
scope
for
experiment
i
refrained
from
making
my
presence
known
and
continued
to
stand
by
the
gate
an
interested
spectator
things
were
evidently
moving
now
the
young
man
gestures
became
more
vigorous
the
dogged
look
on
beale
face
deepened
the
comments
of
the
ring
increased
in
point
and
pungency
what
did
you
hit
him
for
then
the
question
was
put
always
the
same
words
and
with
the
same
air
of
quiet
triumph
at
intervals
of
thirty
seconds
by
a
little
man
in
a
suit
with
a
purple
tie
nobody
ever
answered
him
or
appeared
to
listen
to
him
but
he
seemed
each
time
to
think
that
he
had
clinched
the
matter
and
cornered
his
opponent
other
voices
chimed
in
you
hit
him
charlie
go
on
you
hit
him
we
have
the
law
go
on
charlie
flushed
with
the
favour
of
the
charlie
now
proceeded
from
threats
to
action
his
right
fist
swung
round
suddenly
but
beale
was
on
the
alert
he
ducked
sharply
and
the
next
moment
charlie
was
sitting
on
the
ground
beside
his
fallen
friend
a
hush
fell
on
the
ring
and
the
little
man
in
the
purple
tie
was
left
repeating
his
formula
without
support
i
advanced
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
time
had
come
to
be
conciliatory
charlie
was
struggling
to
his
feet
obviously
anxious
for
a
second
round
and
beale
was
getting
into
position
once
more
in
another
five
minutes
conciliation
would
be
out
of
the
question
what
all
this
i
said
i
may
mention
here
that
i
do
not
propose
to
inflict
dialect
upon
the
reader
if
he
had
borne
with
my
narrative
thus
far
i
look
on
him
as
a
friend
and
feel
that
he
deserves
consideration
i
may
not
have
brought
out
the
fact
with
sufficient
emphasis
in
the
foregoing
pages
but
nevertheless
i
protest
that
i
have
a
conscience
not
so
much
as
a
thiccy
shall
he
find
my
advent
caused
a
stir
excited
men
left
beale
and
rallied
round
me
charlie
rising
to
his
feet
found
himself
dethroned
from
his
position
of
man
of
the
moment
and
stood
blinking
at
the
setting
sun
and
opening
and
shutting
his
mouth
there
was
a
buzz
of
conversation
do
all
speak
at
once
please
i
said
i
ca
possibly
follow
what
you
say
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
what
you
want
i
singled
out
a
short
stout
man
in
grey
he
wore
the
largest
whiskers
ever
seen
on
human
face
it
like
this
sir
we
all
of
us
want
to
know
where
we
are
i
can
tell
you
that
i
said
you
on
our
lawn
and
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
you
would
stop
digging
your
heels
into
it
this
was
not
i
suppose
conciliation
in
the
strictest
and
best
sense
of
the
word
but
the
thing
had
to
be
said
it
is
the
duty
of
every
good
citizen
to
do
his
best
to
score
off
men
with
whiskers
you
do
understand
me
sir
he
said
excitedly
when
i
said
we
did
know
where
we
were
it
was
a
manner
of
speaking
we
want
to
know
how
we
stand
on
your
heels
i
replied
gently
as
i
pointed
out
before
i
am
brass
sir
of
axminster
my
account
with
ukridge
is
ten
pounds
eight
shillings
and
fourpence
i
want
to
know
the
whole
strength
of
the
company
now
joined
in
you
know
me
garnet
appleby
in
the
high
voice
lost
in
the
general
roar
and
eightpence
my
account
with
uk
settle
i
represent
bodger
a
diversion
occurred
at
this
point
charlie
who
had
long
been
eyeing
beale
sourly
dashed
at
him
with
swinging
fists
and
was
knocked
down
again
the
whole
trend
of
the
meeting
altered
once
more
conciliation
became
a
drug
violence
was
what
the
public
wanted
beale
had
three
fights
in
rapid
succession
i
was
helpless
instinct
prompted
me
to
join
the
fray
but
prudence
told
me
that
such
a
course
would
be
fatal
at
last
in
a
lull
i
managed
to
catch
the
hired
retainer
by
the
arm
as
he
drew
back
from
the
prostrate
form
of
his
latest
victim
drop
it
beale
i
whispered
hotly
drop
it
we
shall
never
manage
these
people
if
you
knock
them
about
go
indoors
and
stay
there
while
i
talk
to
them
garnet
sir
said
he
the
light
of
battle
dying
out
of
his
eyes
it
it
cruel
i
ai
a
not
to
a
since
i
been
a
man
i
ai
hitting
of

ai
that
there

one
of
he

hittin
at
me
when
i
was
looking

ca
say
as
i
started
it
that
all
right
beale
i
said
soothingly
i
know
it
was
your
fault
and
i
know
it
hard
on
you
to
have
to
stop
but
i
wish
you
would
go
indoors
i
must
talk
to
these
men
and
we
sha
have
a
moment
peace
while
you
here
cut
along
very
well
sir
but
it
may
i
just
one
go
at
that
charlie
mr
garnet
he
asked
wistfully
no

for
you
sir
and
tries
to
wipe
the
face
off
you
they
wo
they
wo
if
they
do
i
shout
for
you
he
went
reluctantly
into
the
house
and
i
turned
again
to
my
audience
if
you
will
kindly
be
quiet
for
a
moment
i
said
i
am
appleby
garnet
in
the
high
street
ukridge
eighteen
pounds
fourteen
shillings
kindly
glance
i
waved
my
hands
wildly
above
my
head
stop
stop
stop
i
shouted
the
babble
continued
but
diminished
gradually
in
volume
through
the
trees
as
i
waited
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
i
wished
i
was
out
on
the
cob
where
beyond
these
voices
there
was
peace
my
head
was
beginning
to
ache
and
i
felt
faint
for
want
of
food
gentlemen
i
cried
as
the
noise
died
away
the
latch
of
the
gate
clicked
i
looked
up
and
saw
a
tall
thin
young
man
in
a
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
enter
the
garden
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
the
costume
in
the
country
he
approached
me
ukridge
sir
he
said
my
name
is
garnet
ukridge
is
away
at
the
moment
i
come
from
whiteley
garnet
our
blenkinsop
having
written
on
several
occasions
to
ukridge
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
his
account
has
been
allowed
to
mount
to
a
considerable
figure
and
having
received
no
satisfactory
reply
desired
me
to
visit
him
i
am
sorry
that
he
is
not
at
home
so
am
i
i
said
with
feeling
do
you
expect
him
to
return
shortly
no
i
said
i
do
not
he
was
looking
curiously
at
the
expectant
band
of
duns
i
forestalled
his
question
those
are
some
of
ukridge
creditors
i
said
i
am
just
about
to
address
them
perhaps
you
will
take
a
seat
the
grass
is
quite
dry
my
remarks
will
embrace
you
as
well
as
them
comprehension
came
into
his
eyes
and
the
natural
man
in
him
peeped
through
the
polish
great
scott
has
he
done
a
bunk
he
cried
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
yes
i
said
he
whistled
i
turned
again
to
the
local
talent
gentlemen
i
shouted
hear
hear
said
some
idiot
gentlemen
i
intend
to
be
quite
frank
with
you
we
must
decide
just
how
matters
stand
between
us
a
voice
where
ukridge
ukridge
left
for
london
suddenly
bitter
laughter
yesterday
afternoon
personally
i
think
he
will
come
back
very
shortly
hoots
of
derision
greeted
this
prophecy
i
resumed
i
fail
to
see
your
object
in
coming
here
i
have
nothing
for
you
i
could
pay
your
bills
if
i
wanted
to
it
began
to
be
borne
upon
me
that
i
was
becoming
unpopular
i
am
here
simply
as
ukridge
guest
i
proceeded
after
all
why
should
i
spare
the
man
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
his
business
affairs
i
refuse
absolutely
to
be
regarded
as
in
any
way
indebted
to
you
i
am
sorry
for
you
you
have
my
sympathy
that
is
all
i
can
give
you
sympathy
and
good
advice
dissatisfaction
i
was
getting
myself
disliked
and
i
had
meant
to
be
so
conciliatory
to
speak
to
these
unfortunates
words
of
cheer
which
should
be
as
olive
oil
poured
into
a
wound
for
i
really
did
sympathise
with
them
i
considered
that
ukridge
had
used
them
disgracefully
but
i
was
irritated
my
head
ached
abominably
then
am
i
to
tell
our
blenkinsop
asked
the
one
that
the
money
is
not
and
will
not
be
forthcoming
when
next
you
smoke
a
quiet
cigar
with
your
blenkinsop
i
replied
courteously
and
find
conversation
flagging
i
rather
think
i
say
something
of
the
sort
we
shall
of
course
instruct
our
solicitors
at
once
to
institute
legal
proceedings
against
your
mr
ukridge
do
call
him
my
ukridge
you
can
do
whatever
you
please
that
is
your
last
word
on
the
subject
i
hope
so
but
i
fear
not
where
our
money
demanded
a
discontented
voice
from
the
crowd
an
idea
struck
me
beale
i
shouted
out
came
the
hired
retainer
at
the
double
i
fancy
he
thought
that
his
help
was
needed
to
save
me
from
my
friends
he
slowed
down
seeing
me
as
yet
unassaulted
sir
he
said
is
there
a
case
of
that
whisky
left
somewhere
beale
i
had
struck
the
right
note
there
was
a
hush
of
pleased
anticipation
among
the
audience
yes
sir
one
then
bring
it
out
here
and
open
it
beale
looked
pained
for
sir
he
ejaculated
yes
hurry
up
he
hesitated
then
without
a
word
went
into
the
house
a
hearty
cheer
went
up
as
he
reappeared
with
the
case
i
proceeded
indoors
in
search
of
glasses
and
water
coming
out
i
realised
my
folly
in
having
left
beale
alone
with
our
visitors
even
for
a
minute
a
brisk
battle
was
raging
between
him
and
a
man
whom
i
did
not
remember
to
have
seen
before
the
young
man
was
looking
on
with
pale
fear
stamped
upon
his
face
but
the
rest
of
the
crowd
were
shouting
advice
and
encouragement
was
being
given
to
beale
how
i
wondered
had
he
pacified
the
mob
i
soon
discovered
as
i
ran
up
as
quickly
as
i
could
hampered
as
i
was
by
the
jugs
and
glasses
beale
knocked
his
man
out
with
the
clean
precision
of
the
experienced
boxer
and
the
crowd
explained
in
chorus
that
it
was
the
from
the
net
and
mackerel
like
everything
else
the
whisky
had
not
been
paid
for
and
the
arriving
just
as
the
case
was
being
opened
had
made
a
gallant
effort
to
save
it
from
being
distributed
free
to
his
by
the
time
he
came
to
the
glasses
were
circulating
merrily
and
on
observing
this
he
accepted
the
situation
philosophically
enough
and
took
his
turn
and
turn
about
with
the
others
everybody
was
now
in
excellent
fettle
the
only
malcontents
were
beale
whose
heart
plainly
bled
at
the
waste
of
good
scotch
whisky
and
the
young
man
who
was
still
pallid
i
was
just
congratulating
myself
as
i
eyed
the
revellers
on
having
achieved
a
masterstroke
of
strategy
when
that
demon
charlie
his
defeat
i
suppose
still
rankling
made
a
suggestion
from
his
point
of
view
a
timely
and
ingenious
suggestion
we
ca
see
the
colour
of
our
money
he
said
pithily
but
we
can
have
our
own
back
that
settled
it
the
battle
was
over
the
most
skilful
general
must
sometime
recognise
defeat
i
recognised
it
then
and
threw
up
my
hand
i
could
do
nothing
further
with
them
i
had
done
my
best
for
the
farm
i
could
do
no
more
i
lit
my
pipe
and
strolled
into
the
paddock
chaos
followed
indoors
and
they
raged
without
check
even
beale
gave
the
thing
up
he
knocked
charlie
into
a
and
then
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
it
was
growing
dusk
from
inside
the
house
came
faint
sounds
of
bibulous
mirth
as
the
sacking
party
emptied
the
rooms
of
their
contents
in
the
a
hen
was
crooning
sleepily
in
its
coop
it
was
a
very
soft
liquid
soothing
sound
presently
out
came
the
invaders
with
their
loot
one
with
a
picture
another
with
a
vase
another
bearing
the
gramophone
upside
down
they
were
singing
in
many
keys
and
times
then
i
heard
somebody
charlie
again
it
seemed
to
me
propose
a
raid
on
the
the
fowls
had
had
their
moments
of
unrest
since
they
had
been
our
property
but
what
they
had
gone
through
with
us
was
peace
compared
with
what
befell
them
then
not
even
on
the
second
evening
of
our
visit
when
we
had
run
unmeasured
miles
in
pursuit
of
them
had
there
been
such
confusion
roused
abruptly
from
their
they
fled
in
all
directions
their
pursuers
roaring
with
laughter
staggered
after
them
they
tumbled
over
one
another
the
summer
evening
was
made
hideous
with
the
noise
of
them
disgraceful
sir
is
it
not
disgraceful
said
a
voice
in
my
ear
the
young
man
from
whiteley
stood
beside
me
he
did
not
look
happy
his
forehead
was
damp
somebody
seemed
to
have
stepped
on
his
hat
and
his
coat
was
smeared
with
mould
i
was
turning
to
answer
him
when
from
the
dusk
in
the
direction
of
the
house
came
a
sudden
roar
a
passionate
appeal
to
the
world
in
general
to
tell
the
speaker
what
all
this
meant
there
was
only
one
man
of
my
acquaintance
with
a
voice
like
that
i
walked
without
hurry
towards
him
good
evening
ukridge
i
said
chapter
xxiii
after
the
storm
a
yell
of
welcome
drowned
the
tumult
of
the
looters
is
that
you
garny
old
horse
what
up
what
the
matter
has
everyone
gone
mad
who
are
those
infernal
scoundrels
in
the
what
are
they
doing
what
been
happening
i
have
been
entertaining
a
little
meeting
of
your
creditors
i
said
and
now
they
are
entertaining
themselves
but
what
did
you
let
them
do
it
for
what
is
one
amongst
so
many
well
my
sam
moaned
ukridge
as
her
sardonic
calm
laid
aside
that
sinister
hen
which
we
called
aunt
elizabeth
flashed
past
us
pursued
by
the
whiskered
criminal
it
a
little
hard
i
ca
go
away
for
a
day
you
certainly
ca
you
right
there
you
ca
go
away
without
a
word
without
a
word
what
do
you
mean
garny
old
boy
pull
yourself
together
you
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
did
get
my
note
what
note
the
one
i
left
on
the
table
there
was
no
note
there
what
i
was
reminded
of
the
scene
that
had
taken
place
on
the
first
day
of
our
visit
feel
in
your
pockets
i
said
why
damme
here
it
is
he
said
in
amazement
of
course
where
did
you
expect
it
would
be
was
it
important
why
it
explained
the
whole
thing
then
i
said
i
wish
you
would
let
me
read
it
a
note
like
that
ought
to
be
worth
reading
it
was
telling
you
to
sit
tight
and
not
worry
about
us
going
away
that
good
about
worrying
you
a
thoughtful
chap
ukridge
because
we
should
be
back
immediately
and
what
sent
you
up
to
town
why
we
went
to
touch
millie
aunt
elizabeth
oh
i
said
a
light
shining
on
the
darkness
of
my
understanding
you
remember
aunt
elizabeth
the
old
girl
who
wrote
that
letter
i
know
she
called
you
a
gaby
and
a
guffin
yes
i
remember
thinking
her
a
shrewd
and
discriminating
old
lady
with
a
great
gift
for
character
delineation
so
you
went
to
touch
her
that
it
we
had
to
have
more
money
so
i
naturally
thought
of
her
aunt
elizabeth
is
what
you
might
call
an
admirer
of
mine
bless
her
for
that
but
she
very
fond
of
millie
and
would
do
anything
if
allowed
to
chuck
about
a
few
before
doing
it
so
we
went
off
together
looked
her
up
at
her
house
stated
our
case
and
collected
the
stuff
millie
and
i
shared
the
work
she
did
the
asking
while
i
inquired
after
the
rheumatism
she
mentioned
the
figure
that
would
clear
us
i
patted
the
dog
little
beast
got
after
me
when
i
was
looking
and
chewed
my
ankle
thank
heaven
in
the
end
millie
got
the
money
and
i
got
the
did
she
call
you
a
gaby
twice
and
a
guffin
three
times
your
aunt
elizabeth
is
beginning
to
fascinate
me
she
seems
just
the
sort
of
woman
i
would
like
well
you
got
the
money
rather
and
i
tell
you
another
thing
old
horse
i
scored
heavily
at
the
end
of
the
visit
she
got
to
the
stage
by
that
time
my
dear
she
said
to
millie
in
haste
repent
at
leisure
millie
stood
up
to
her
like
a
little
brick
afraid
that
proverb
does
apply
to
me
aunt
elizabeth
she
said
i
have
repented
what
do
you
think
of
that
laddie
of
course
she
had
much
leisure
lately
i
agreed
ukridge
jaw
dropped
slightly
but
he
rallied
swiftly
idiot
that
was
what
she
meant
millie
an
angel
of
course
she
is
i
said
cordially
she
a
precious
sight
too
good
for
you
you
old
rotter
you
bear
that
fact
steadily
in
mind
and
make
something
of
you
yet
at
this
point
ukridge
joined
us
she
had
been
exploring
the
house
and
noting
the
damage
done
her
eyes
were
open
to
their
fullest
extent
oh
garnet
you
have
stopped
them
i
felt
a
worm
had
i
done
as
much
as
i
might
have
done
to
stem
the
tide
i
awfully
sorry
ukridge
i
said
humbly
i
really
do
think
i
could
have
done
much
more
we
tried
every
method
beale
had
seven
fights
and
i
made
a
speech
on
the
lawn
but
it
was
all
no
good
directly
they
had
finished
the
whisky
ukridge
cry
was
like
that
of
a
lost
spirit
they
did
get
hold
of
the
whisky
they
did
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
smooth
things
down
a
little
if
i
served
it
out
the
mob
had
begun
to
get
a
trifle
out
of
hand
i
thought
those
horrid
men
were
making
a
lot
of
noise
said
ukridge
ukridge
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
of
all
the
disasters
of
that
stricken
field
i
think
the
one
that
came
home
most
poignantly
to
him
was
the
loss
of
the
whisky
it
seemed
to
strike
him
like
a
blow
is
it
about
time
to
collect
these
men
and
explain
things
i
suggested
i
do
believe
any
of
them
know
you
come
back
they
will
said
ukridge
grimly
coming
out
of
his
trance
they
soon
will
where
beale
beale
the
hired
retainer
came
running
out
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
lumme
ukridge
sir
he
gasped
it
was
the
first
time
beale
had
ever
betrayed
any
real
emotion
in
my
presence
to
him
i
suppose
the
return
of
ukridge
was
as
sensational
and
astonishing
an
event
as
a
from
the
tomb
he
was
not
accustomed
to
find
those
who
had
shot
the
moon
revisiting
their
ancient
haunts
beale
go
round
the
place
and
tell
those
scoundrels
that
i
come
back
and
would
like
a
word
with
them
on
the
lawn
and
if
you
find
any
of
them
stealing
the
fowls
knock
them
down
i
knocked
down
one
or
two
said
beale
with
approval
that
charlie
beale
said
ukridge
much
moved
you
an
excellent
fellow
one
of
the
very
best
i
will
pay
you
your
back
wages
before
i
go
to
bed
these
fellars
sir
said
beale
having
expressed
his
gratification
they
bin
and
scattered
most
of
them
birds
already
sir
they
bin
chasin
of
them
this
back
ukridge
groaned
scoundrels
demons
beale
went
off
millie
old
girl
said
ukridge
adjusting
the
wire
behind
his
ears
and
hoisting
up
his
grey
which
showed
an
inclination
to
sag
you
better
go
indoors
i
propose
to
speak
pretty
chattily
to
these
blighters
and
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
one
or
two
expressions
might
occur
to
me
which
you
would
not
like
it
would
hamper
me
your
being
here
ukridge
went
into
the
house
and
the
vanguard
of
the
audience
began
to
come
on
to
the
lawn
several
of
them
looked
flushed
and
dishevelled
i
have
a
suspicion
that
beale
had
shaken
sobriety
into
them
charlie
i
noticed
had
a
black
eye
they
assembled
on
the
lawn
in
the
moonlight
and
ukridge
with
his
cap
well
over
his
eyes
and
his
mackintosh
hanging
round
him
like
a
roman
toga
surveyed
them
sternly
and
began
his
speech
you
you
you
you
scoundrels
you
blighters
you
worms
you
weeds
i
always
like
to
think
of
stanley
featherstonehaugh
ukridge
as
i
saw
him
at
that
moment
there
have
been
times
during
a
friendship
of
many
years
when
his
conduct
did
not
recommend
itself
to
me
it
has
sometimes
happened
that
i
have
seen
flaws
in
him
but
on
this
occasion
he
was
at
his
best
he
was
eloquent
he
dominated
his
audience
long
before
he
had
finished
i
was
feeling
relieved
that
he
had
thought
of
sending
ukridge
indoors
when
he
did
and
beale
was
hanging
on
his
words
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
i
had
never
seen
there
before
a
look
of
reverence
almost
of
awe
the
look
of
a
disciple
who
listens
to
a
master
he
poured
scorn
upon
his
hearers
and
they
quailed
he
flung
invective
at
them
and
they
wilted
strange
oaths
learned
among
strange
men
on
or
gleaned
on
the
waterfronts
of
buenos
ayres
and
san
francisco
slid
into
the
stream
of
his
speech
it
was
hard
he
said
in
part
it
was
upon
his
sam
a
little
hard
that
a
gentleman
a
gentleman
moreover
who
had
done
so
much
to
stimulate
local
trade
with
large
orders
and
what
not
could
not
run
up
to
london
for
five
minutes
on
business
without
having
his
private
grounds
turned
upside
down
by
a
gang
of
adjectived
san
francisco
substantives
who
behaved
as
if
the
whole
of
the
buenos
ayres
phrased
place
belonged
to
them
he
had
intended
to
do
well
by
them
he
had
meant
to
continue
putting
business
in
their
way
expanding
their
trade
but
would
he
after
what
had
occurred
not
by
a
jugful
as
soon
as
ever
the
sun
had
risen
and
another
day
begun
their
miserable
accounts
should
be
paid
in
full
and
their
connection
with
him
cut
off
afterwards
it
was
probable
that
he
would
institute
legal
proceedings
against
them
in
the
matter
of
trespass
and
wholesale
damage
to
property
and
if
they
did
all
end
their
infernal
days
in
some
dashed
prison
they
might
consider
themselves
uncommonly
lucky
and
if
they
did
make
themselves
scarce
in
considerably
under
two
ticks
he
proposed
to
see
what
could
be
done
with
beale
beale
here
withdrew
with
a
pleased
expression
to
fetch
the
weapon
he
was
sick
of
them
they
were
blighters
creatures
that
it
would
be
fulsome
flattery
to
describe
as
human
beings
he
would
call
them
skunks
only
he
did
not
see
what
the
skunks
had
done
to
be
compared
with
them
and
now
they
might
go
we
were
quiet
at
the
farm
that
night
ukridge
sat
like
marius
among
the
ruins
of
carthage
and
refused
to
speak
eventually
he
took
bob
with
him
and
went
for
a
walk
half
an
hour
later
i
too
wearied
of
the
scene
of
desolation
my
errant
steps
took
me
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
as
i
approached
i
was
aware
of
a
figure
standing
in
the
moonlight
gazing
silently
out
over
the
waters
beside
the
figure
was
a
dog
the
dark
moments
of
optimistic
minds
are
sacred
and
i
would
no
more
have
ventured
to
break
in
on
ukridge
thoughts
at
that
moment
than
if
i
had
been
a
general
in
the
grand
army
i
would
have
opened
conversation
with
napoleon
during
the
retreat
from
moscow
i
was
withdrawing
as
softly
as
i
could
when
my
foot
grated
on
the
shingle
ukridge
turned
hullo
garny
hullo
old
man
i
murmured
in
a
voice
he
came
towards
me
bob
trotting
at
his
heels
and
as
he
came
i
saw
with
astonishment
that
his
mien
was
calm
even
cheerful
i
should
have
known
my
ukridge
better
than
to
be
astonished
you
can
not
keep
a
good
man
down
and
already
stanley
featherstonehaugh
ukridge
was
himself
again
his
eyes
sparkled
buoyantly
behind
their
garny
old
horse
i
been
thinking
laddie
i
got
an
idea
the
idea
of
a
lifetime
the
best
ever
my
sam
i
going
to
start
a
duck
farm
a
duck
farm
a
duck
farm
laddie
and
run
it
without
water
my
theory
is
you
see
that
ducks
get
thin
by
taking
exercise
and
swimming
about
all
over
the
place
so
that
if
you
kept
them
always
on
land
they
get
jolly
fat
in
about
half
the
time
and
no
trouble
and
expense
see
what
not
a
flaw
in
it
old
horse
i
thought
the
whole
thing
out
he
took
my
arm
affectionately
now
listen
we
say
that
the
profits
of
the
first
year
at
a
conservative
estimate
the
end
