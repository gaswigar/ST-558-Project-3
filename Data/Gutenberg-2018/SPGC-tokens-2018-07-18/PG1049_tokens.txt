recollections
of
the
army
life
by
a
new
england
woman
by
martha
summerhayes
to
my
son
harry
summerhayes
who
shared
the
vicissitudes
of
my
life
in
arizona
this
book
is
affectionately
dedicated
preface
i
have
written
this
story
of
my
army
life
at
the
urgent
and
ceaseless
request
of
my
children
for
whenever
i
allude
to
those
early
days
and
tell
to
them
the
tales
they
have
so
often
heard
they
always
say
now
mother
will
you
write
these
stories
for
us
please
mother
do
we
must
never
forget
them
then
after
an
interval
mother
have
you
written
those
stories
of
arizona
yet
until
finally
with
the
aid
of
some
old
letters
written
from
those
very
places
the
letters
having
been
preserved
with
other
papers
of
mine
by
an
uncle
in
new
england
long
since
dead
i
have
been
able
to
give
a
fairly
connected
story
i
have
not
attempted
to
commemorate
my
husband
brave
career
in
the
civil
war
as
i
was
not
married
until
some
years
after
the
close
of
that
war
nor
to
describe
the
many
indian
campaigns
in
which
he
took
part
nor
to
write
about
the
achievements
of
the
old
eighth
infantry
i
leave
all
that
to
the
historian
i
have
given
simply
the
impressions
made
upon
the
mind
of
a
young
new
england
woman
who
left
her
comfortable
home
in
the
early
seventies
to
follow
a
second
lieutenant
into
the
wildest
encampments
of
the
american
army
hoping
the
story
may
possess
some
interest
for
the
younger
women
of
the
army
and
possibly
for
some
of
our
old
friends
both
in
the
army
and
in
civil
life
i
venture
to
send
it
forth
postcript
second
edition
the
appendix
to
this
the
second
edition
of
my
book
will
tell
something
of
the
kind
manner
in
which
the
first
edition
was
received
by
my
friends
and
the
public
at
large
but
as
several
people
had
expressed
a
wish
that
i
should
tell
more
of
my
army
experiences
i
have
gone
carefully
over
the
entire
book
adding
some
detail
and
a
few
incidents
which
had
come
to
my
mind
later
i
have
also
been
able
with
some
difficulty
and
much
patient
effort
to
secure
several
photographs
of
exceptional
interest
which
have
been
added

germany
and
the
army
the
stalwart
men
of
the
prussian
army
the
lancers
the
dragoons
the
hussars
the
clank
of
their
sabres
on
the
pavements
their
brilliant
uniforms
all
made
an
impression
upon
my
romantic
mind
and
i
listened
eagerly
in
the
quiet
evenings
to
tales
of
hanover
under
king
george
to
stories
of
battles
lost
and
the
entry
of
the
prussians
into
the
old
the
flight
of
the
king
and
the
sorrow
and
chagrin
which
prevailed
for
i
was
living
in
the
family
of
general
weste
the
former
of
hanover
who
had
served
fifty
years
in
the
army
and
had
accompanied
king
george
on
his
exit
from
the
city
he
was
a
gallant
veteran
with
the
rank
of
ausser
dienst
a
charming
and
dignified
man
accepting
philosophically
the
fact
that
hanover
had
become
prussian
but
loyal
in
his
heart
to
his
king
and
to
old
hanover
pretending
great
wrath
when
on
the
king
birthday
he
found
yellow
and
white
sand
strewn
before
his
door
but
unable
to
conceal
the
joyful
gleam
in
his
eye
when
he
spoke
of
it
the
general
wife
was
the
daughter
of
a
burgomaster
and
had
been
brought
up
in
a
neighboring
town
she
was
a
dear
kind
soul
the
was
simple
but
stately
and
precise
as
befitted
the
rank
of
this
officer
the
general
was
addressed
by
the
servants
as
excellenz
and
his
wife
as
frau
excellenz
a
charming
unmarried
daughter
lived
at
home
making
with
myself
a
family
of
four
life
was
spent
quietly
and
every
evening
after
our
coffee
served
in
the
in
winter
and
in
the
garden
in
summer
frau
generalin
would
amuse
me
with
descriptions
of
life
in
her
old
home
and
of
how
girls
were
brought
up
in
her
day
how
industry
was
esteemed
by
her
mother
the
greatest
virtue
and
idleness
was
punished
as
the
most
beguiling
sin
she
was
never
allowed
she
said
to
read
even
on
sunday
without
her
in
her
hands
and
she
would
often
sigh
and
say
to
me
in
german
for
dear
frau
generalin
spoke
no
other
tongue
ach
martha
you
american
girls
are
so
differently
brought
up
and
i
would
say
but
frau
generalin
which
way
do
you
think
is
the
better
she
would
then
look
puzzled
shrug
her
shoulders
and
often
say
ach
times
are
different
i
suppose
but
my
ideas
can
never
change
now
the
dear
frau
generalin
did
not
speak
a
word
of
english
and
as
i
had
had
only
a
few
lessons
in
german
before
i
left
america
i
had
the
utmost
difficulty
at
first
in
comprehending
what
she
said
she
spoke
rapidly
and
i
would
listen
with
the
closest
attention
only
to
give
up
in
despair
and
to
say
gute
nacht
evening
after
evening
with
my
head
buzzing
and
my
mind
a
blank
after
a
few
weeks
however
i
began
to
understand
everything
she
said
altho
i
could
not
yet
write
or
read
the
language
and
i
listened
with
the
greatest
interest
to
the
story
of
her
marriage
with
young
lieutenant
weste
of
the
bringing
up
of
her
four
children
and
of
the
old
days
in
hanover
before
the
prussians
took
possession
she
described
to
me
the
brilliant
hanoverian
court
the
endless
festivities
and
balls
the
stately
elegance
of
the
old
city
and
the
cruel
misfortunes
of
the
king
and
how
a
few
days
after
the
flight
the
end
of
all
things
came
to
her
for
she
was
politely
informed
one
evening
by
a
big
prussian
major
that
she
must
seek
other
lodgings
he
needed
her
quarters
at
this
point
she
always
wept
and
i
sympathized
thus
i
came
to
know
military
life
in
germany
and
i
fell
in
love
with
the
army
with
its
brilliancy
and
its
glitter
with
its
struggles
and
its
romance
with
its
sharp
contrasts
its
deprivations
and
its
chivalry
i
came
to
know
as
their
guest
the
best
of
old
military
society
they
were
very
and
precise
and
frau
generalin
often
told
me
that
american
girls
were
too
ausgelassen
in
their
manners
she
often
reproved
me
for
seating
myself
upon
the
sofa
which
was
only
for
old
people
and
also
for
looking
about
too
much
when
walking
on
the
streets
young
girls
must
keep
their
eyes
more
cast
down
looking
up
only
occasionally
i
thought
this
dreadfully
prim
as
i
was
eager
to
see
everything
i
was
expected
to
stop
and
drop
a
little
courtesy
on
meeting
an
older
woman
and
then
to
inquire
after
the
health
of
each
member
of
the
family
it
seemed
to
take
a
lot
of
time
but
all
the
other
girls
did
it
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
hurry
about
anything
ever
in
that
elegant
old
surely
a
contrast
to
our
bustling
american
towns
a
sentiment
seemed
to
underlie
everything
they
did
the
emperor
meant
so
much
to
them
and
they
adored
the
empress
a
personal
feeling
an
affection
such
as
i
had
never
heard
of
in
a
republic
caused
me
to
stop
and
wonder
if
an
empire
were
not
the
best
after
all
and
one
day
when
the
emperor
passing
through
hanover
en
route
drove
down
the
in
an
open
barouche
and
raised
his
hat
as
he
glanced
at
the
sidewalk
where
i
happened
to
be
standing
my
heart
seemed
to
stop
beating
and
i
was
overcome
by
a
most
wonderful
feeling
a
feeling
that
in
a
man
would
have
meant
chivalry
and
loyalty
unto
death
in
this
beautiful
old
city
life
could
not
be
taken
any
other
than
leisurely
theatres
with
early
hours
the
maid
coming
for
me
with
a
lantern
at
nine
the
frequent
the
delightful
afternoon
coffee
at
the
the
visits
to
the
zoological
gardens
where
we
always
took
our
fresh
rolls
along
with
our
in
a
basket
and
then
sat
at
a
little
table
in
the
open
and
were
served
with
coffee
sweet
cream
and
butter
by
a
strapping
hessian
peasant
woman
all
so
simple
yet
so
elegant
so
peaceful
we
heard
the
best
music
at
the
theatre
which
was
managed
with
the
same
precision
and
maintained
by
the
government
with
the
same
generosity
as
in
the
days
of
king
george
no
one
was
allowed
to
enter
after
the
overture
had
begun
and
an
absolute
hush
prevailed
the
orchestra
consisted
of
sixty
or
more
pieces
and
the
audience
was
critical
the
parquet
was
filled
with
officers
in
the
gayest
uniforms
there
were
few
ladies
amongst
them
the
latter
sat
mostly
in
the
boxes
of
which
there
were
several
tiers
and
as
soon
as
the
curtain
fell
between
the
acts
the
officers
would
rise
turn
around
and
level
their
glasses
at
the
boxes
sometimes
they
came
and
visited
in
the
boxes
as
i
had
been
brought
up
in
a
town
half
quaker
half
puritan
the
custom
of
going
to
the
theatre
sunday
evenings
was
rather
a
questionable
one
in
my
mind
but
i
soon
fell
in
with
their
ways
and
found
that
on
sunday
evenings
there
was
always
the
most
brilliant
audience
and
the
best
plays
were
selected
with
this
of
the
wall
of
narrow
prejudice
i
gave
up
others
equally
as
narrow
and
adopted
the
german
customs
with
my
whole
heart
i
studied
the
language
with
unflinching
perseverance
for
this
was
the
opportunity
i
had
dreamed
about
and
longed
for
in
the
barren
winter
evenings
at
nantucket
when
i
sat
poring
over
coleridge
translations
of
schiller
plays
and
bayard
taylor
version
of
goethe
faust
should
i
ever
read
these
intelligently
in
the
original
and
when
my
father
consented
for
me
to
go
over
and
spend
a
year
and
live
in
general
weste
family
there
never
was
a
happier
or
more
grateful
young
woman
appreciative
and
eager
i
did
not
waste
a
moment
and
my
keen
enjoyment
of
the
german
classics
repaid
me
a
hundred
fold
for
all
my
industry
neither
time
nor
misfortune
nor
illness
can
take
from
me
the
memory
of
that
year
of
privileges
such
as
is
given
few
american
girls
to
enjoy
when
they
are
at
an
age
to
fully
appreciate
them
and
so
completely
separated
was
i
from
the
american
and
english
colony
that
i
rarely
heard
my
own
language
spoken
and
thus
i
lived
ate
listened
talked
and
even
dreamed
in
german
there
seemed
to
be
time
enough
to
do
everything
we
wished
and
as
the
war
was
just
over
it
was
the
year
of
and
many
troops
were
in
garrison
at
hanover
the
officers
could
always
join
us
at
the
various
gardens
for
coffee
which
by
the
way
was
not
taken
in
the
but
in
good
generous
with
plenty
of
rich
cream
every
one
drank
at
least
two
cups
the
officers
smoked
the
women
knitted
or
embroidered
and
those
were
among
the
pleasantest
hours
i
spent
in
germany
the
intrusion
of
unwelcome
visitors
was
never
to
be
feared
as
by
common
consent
the
various
classes
in
hanover
kept
by
themselves
thus
enjoying
life
much
better
than
in
a
country
where
everybody
is
striving
after
the
pleasures
and
luxuries
enjoyed
by
those
whom
circumstances
have
placed
above
them
the
gay
uniforms
lent
a
brilliancy
to
every
affair
however
simple
officers
were
not
allowed
to
appear
en
civile
unless
on
leave
of
absence
i
used
to
say
oh
frau
general
how
fascinating
it
all
is
hush
martha
she
would
say
life
in
the
army
is
not
always
so
brilliant
as
it
looks
in
fact
we
often
call
it
over
here
elend
these
bitter
words
made
a
great
impression
upon
my
mind
and
in
after
years
on
the
american
frontier
i
seemed
to
hear
them
over
and
over
again
when
i
bade
to
the
general
and
his
family
i
felt
a
tightening
about
my
throat
and
my
heart
and
i
could
not
speak
life
in
germany
had
become
dear
to
me
and
i
had
not
known
how
dear
until
i
was
leaving
it
forever
chapter
ii
i
joined
the
army
i
was
put
in
charge
of
the
captain
of
the
north
german
lloyd
donau
and
after
a
most
terrific
cyclone
in
in
which
we
nearly
foundered
i
landed
in
hoboken
sixteen
days
from
bremen
my
brother
harry
dunham
met
me
on
the
pier
saying
as
he
took
me
in
his
arms
you
do
not
need
to
tell
me
what
sort
of
a
trip
you
have
had
it
is
enough
to
look
at
the
ship
that
tells
the
story
as
the
vessel
had
been
about
given
up
for
lost
her
arrival
was
somewhat
of
an
agreeable
surprise
to
all
our
friends
and
to
none
more
so
than
my
old
friend
jack
a
second
lieutenant
of
the
united
states
army
who
seemed
so
glad
to
have
me
back
in
america
that
i
concluded
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
join
the
army
myself
a
quiet
wedding
in
the
country
soon
followed
my
decision
and
we
set
out
early
in
april
of
the
year
to
join
his
regiment
which
was
stationed
at
fort
russell
cheyenne
wyoming
territory
i
had
never
been
west
of
new
york
and
cheyenne
seemed
to
me
in
contrast
with
the
finished
civilization
of
europe
which
i
had
so
recently
left
the
wildest
sort
of
a
place
arriving
in
the
morning
and
alighting
from
the
train
two
gallant
officers
in
the
uniform
of
the
united
states
infantry
approached
and
gave
us
welcome
and
to
me
the
bride
a
special
welcome
to
the
regiment
was
given
by
each
of
them
with
outstretched
hands
major
wilhelm
said
the
ambulance
is
right
here
you
must
come
to
our
house
and
stay
until
you
get
your
quarters
such
was
my
introduction
to
the
army
and
to
the
army
ambulance
in
which
i
was
destined
to
travel
so
many
miles
four
lively
mules
and
a
soldier
driver
brought
us
soon
to
the
post
and
wilhelm
welcomed
us
to
her
pleasant
and
quarters
i
had
never
seen
an
army
post
in
america
i
had
always
lived
in
places
which
needed
no
garrison
and
the
army
except
in
germany
was
an
unknown
quantity
to
me
fort
russell
was
a
large
post
and
the
garrison
consisted
of
many
companies
of
cavalry
and
infantry
it
was
all
new
and
strange
to
me
soon
after
luncheon
jack
said
to
major
wilhelm
well
now
i
must
go
and
look
for
quarters
what
the
prospect
you
will
have
to
turn
some
one
out
said
the
major
as
they
left
the
house
together
about
an
hour
afterwards
they
returned
and
jack
said
well
i
have
turned
out
lynch
but
he
added
as
his
wife
and
child
are
away
i
do
not
believe
he
care
very
much
oh
said
i
i
so
sorry
to
have
to
turn
anybody
out
the
major
and
his
wife
smiled
and
the
former
remarked
you
must
not
have
too
much
sympathy
it
the
custom
of
the
service
it
always
done
by
virtue
of
rank
they
hate
you
for
doing
it
but
if
you
do
do
it
they
not
respect
you
after
you
been
turned
out
once
yourself
you
will
not
mind
turning
others
out
the
following
morning
i
drove
over
to
cheyenne
with
wilhelm
and
as
i
passed
lieutenant
lynch
quarters
and
saw
soldiers
removing
lynch
lares
and
penates
in
the
shape
of
a
sewing
machine
and
other
things
i
turned
away
in
pity
that
such
customs
could
exist
in
our
service
to
me
who
had
lived
my
life
in
the
house
in
which
i
was
born
moving
was
a
thing
to
be
dreaded
but
wilhelm
comforted
me
and
assured
me
it
was
not
such
a
serious
matter
after
all
army
women
were
accustomed
to
it
she
said
chapter
iii
army
not
knowing
before
i
left
home
just
what
was
needed
for
in
the
army
and
being
able
to
gather
only
vague
ideas
on
the
subject
from
jack
who
declared
that
his
quarters
were
furnished
admirably
i
had
taken
out
with
me
but
few
articles
in
addition
to
the
silver
and
i
began
to
have
serious
doubts
on
the
subject
of
my
menage
after
inspecting
the
bachelor
furnishings
which
had
seemed
so
ample
to
my
husband
but
there
was
so
much
to
be
seen
in
the
way
of
guard
mount
cavalry
drill
and
various
military
functions
besides
the
drives
to
town
and
the
concerts
of
the
string
orchestra
that
i
had
little
time
to
think
of
the
practical
side
of
life
added
to
this
we
were
enjoying
the
delightful
hospitality
of
the
wilhelms
and
the
major
insisted
upon
making
me
acquainted
with
the
real
army
toddy
several
times
a
day
a
new
beverage
to
me
brought
up
in
a
community
where
and
whiskey
drinking
were
rated
as
belonging
to
only
the
lowest
classes
to
be
sure
my
father
always
drank
two
fingers
of
fine
cognac
before
dinner
but
i
had
always
considered
that
a
sort
of
medicine
for
a
man
advanced
in
years
taken
all
in
all
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
i
saw
not
much
in
those
few
days
besides
bright
buttons
blue
uniforms
and
shining
swords
everything
was
military
and
gay
and
brilliant
and
i
forgot
the
very
existence
of
practical
things
in
listening
to
the
dreamy
strains
of
italian
and
german
music
rendered
by
our
excellent
and
painstaking
orchestra
for
the
eighth
infantry
loved
good
music
and
had
imported
its
musicians
direct
from
italy
this
came
to
an
end
however
after
a
few
days
and
i
was
obliged
to
descend
from
those
heights
to
the
dead
level
of
domestic
economy
my
husband
informed
me
that
the
quarters
were
ready
for
our
occupancy
and
that
we
could
begin
at
once
he
had
engaged
a
soldier
named
adams
for
a
striker
he
did
not
know
whether
adams
was
much
of
a
cook
he
said
but
he
was
the
only
available
man
just
then
as
the
companies
were
up
north
at
the
agency
our
quarters
consisted
of
three
rooms
and
a
kitchen
which
formed
of
a
double
house
i
asked
jack
why
we
could
not
have
a
whole
house
i
did
not
think
i
could
possibly
live
in
three
rooms
and
a
kitchen
why
martha
said
he
did
you
not
know
that
women
are
not
reckoned
in
at
all
at
the
war
department
a
lieutenant
allowance
of
quarters
according
to
the
army
regulations
is
one
room
and
a
kitchen
a
captain
allowance
is
two
rooms
and
a
kitchen
and
so
on
up
until
a
colonel
has
a
fairly
good
house
i
told
him
i
thought
it
an
outrage
that
lieutenants
wives
needed
quite
as
much
as
colonels
wives
he
laughed
and
said
you
see
we
have
already
two
rooms
over
our
proper
allowance
there
are
so
many
married
officers
that
the
government
has
had
to
stretch
a
point
after
indulging
in
some
rather
harsh
comments
upon
a
government
which
could
treat
lieutenants
wives
so
shabbily
i
began
to
investigate
my
surroundings
jack
had
placed
his
furnishings
some
lace
curtains
camp
chairs
and
a
carpet
in
the
and
there
was
a
bedstead
in
the
bedroom
a
pine
table
in
the
and
a
range
in
the
kitchen
completed
the
outfit
a
soldier
had
scrubbed
the
rough
floors
with
a
straw
broom
it
was
absolutely
forlorn
and
my
heart
sank
within
me
but
then
i
thought
of
wilhelm
quarters
and
resolved
to
try
my
best
to
make
ours
look
as
cheerful
and
pretty
as
hers
a
chaplain
was
about
leaving
the
post
and
wished
to
dispose
of
his
things
so
we
bought
a
carpet
of
him
a
few
more
camp
chairs
of
various
designs
and
a
we
were
obliged
to
be
very
economical
as
jack
was
a
second
lieutenant
the
pay
was
small
and
a
little
in
arrears
after
the
wedding
trip
and
long
journey
out
we
bought
white
holland
shades
for
the
windows
and
made
the
three
rooms
fairly
comfortable
and
then
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
kitchen
jack
said
i
should
not
have
to
buy
anything
at
all
the
quartermaster
department
furnished
everything
in
the
line
of
kitchen
utensils
and
as
his
word
was
law
i
went
over
to
the
quartermaster
to
select
the
needed
articles
after
what
i
had
been
told
i
was
surprised
to
find
nothing
smaller
than
a
yard
long
and
deep
enough
to
cook
rations
for
fifty
men
i
rebelled
and
said
i
would
not
use
such
gigantic
things
my
husband
said
now
mattie
be
reasonable
all
the
army
women
keep
house
with
these
utensils
the
regiment
will
move
soon
and
then
what
should
we
do
with
a
lot
of
tin
pans
and
such
stuff
you
know
a
second
lieutenant
is
allowed
only
a
thousand
pounds
of
baggage
when
he
changes
station
this
was
a
hard
lesson
which
i
learned
later
having
been
brought
up
in
an
community
where
women
deferred
to
their
husbands
in
everything
i
yielded
and
the
huge
things
were
sent
over
i
had
told
wilhelm
that
we
were
to
have
luncheon
in
our
own
quarters
so
adams
made
a
fire
large
enough
to
roast
beef
for
a
company
of
soldiers
and
he
and
i
attempted
to
boil
a
few
eggs
in
the
deep
and
to
make
the
water
boil
in
the
huge
but
adams
as
it
turned
out
was
not
a
cook
and
i
must
confess
that
my
own
attention
had
been
more
engrossed
by
the
study
of
german
auxiliary
verbs
during
the
few
previous
years
than
with
the
art
of
cooking
of
course
like
all
new
england
girls
of
that
period
i
knew
how
to
make
quince
jelly
and
floating
islands
but
of
the
actual
practical
side
of
cooking
and
the
management
of
a
range
i
knew
nothing
here
was
a
dilemma
indeed
the
eggs
appeared
to
boil
but
they
did
not
seem
to
be
done
when
we
took
them
off
by
the
of
the
clock
i
declared
the
kettle
was
too
large
adams
said
he
did
not
understand
it
at
all
i
could
have
wept
with
chagrin
our
first
meal
a
deux
i
appealed
to
jack
he
said
why
of
course
martha
you
ought
to
know
that
things
do
not
cook
as
quickly
at
this
altitude
as
they
do
down
at
the
sea
level
we
are
thousands
of
feet
above
the
sea
here
in
wyoming
i
am
not
sure
it
was
thousands
but
it
was
hundreds
at
least
so
that
was
the
trouble
and
i
had
not
thought
of
it
my
head
was
giddy
with
the
glamour
the
uniform
the
the
military
music
the
rarefied
air
the
new
conditions
the
new
interests
of
my
life
heine
songs
goethe
plays
history
and
romance
were
floating
through
my
mind
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
i
and
adams
together
prepared
the
most
atrocious
meals
that
ever
a
new
husband
had
to
eat
i
related
my
difficulties
to
jack
and
told
him
i
thought
we
should
never
be
able
to
manage
with
such
kitchen
utensils
as
were
furnished
by
the
oh
pshaw
you
are
pampered
and
spoiled
with
your
new
england
kitchens
said
he
you
will
have
to
learn
to
do
as
other
army
women
do
cook
in
cans
and
such
things
be
inventive
and
learn
to
do
with
nothing
this
was
my
first
lesson
in
army
after
my
unpractical
teacher
had
gone
out
on
some
official
business
i
ran
over
to
wilhelm
quarters
and
said
will
you
let
me
see
your
kitchen
closet
she
assented
and
i
saw
the
most
beautiful
array
of
shining
and
neat
placed
in
rows
upon
the
shelves
and
hanging
from
hooks
on
the
wall
so
i
said
my
military
husband
does
not
know
anything
about
these
things
and
i
availed
myself
of
the
first
trip
of
the
ambulance
over
to
cheyenne
bought
a
stock
of
and
had
it
charged
and
made
no
mention
of
it
because
i
feared
that
was
to
be
our
bone
of
contention
and
i
put
off
the
evil
day
the
cooking
went
on
better
after
that
but
i
did
not
have
much
assistance
from
adams
i
had
great
trouble
at
first
with
the
titles
and
the
rank
but
i
soon
learned
that
many
of
the
officers
were
addressed
by
the
brevet
title
bestowed
upon
them
for
gallant
service
in
the
civil
war
and
i
began
to
understand
about
the
ways
and
customs
of
the
army
of
uncle
sam
in
contrast
to
the
germans
the
american
lieutenants
were
not
addressed
by
their
title
except
officially
i
learned
to
all
the
lieutenants
who
had
no
brevet
one
morning
i
suggested
to
adams
that
he
should
wash
the
front
windows
after
being
gone
a
half
hour
to
borrow
a
he
entered
the
room
mounted
the
ladder
and
began
i
sat
writing
suddenly
he
faced
around
and
addressing
me
said
madam
do
you
believe
in
spiritualism
good
gracious
adams
no
why
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
this
was
enough
he
proceeded
to
give
a
lecture
on
the
subject
worthy
of
a
man
higher
up
on
the
ladder
of
this
life
i
bade
him
come
to
an
end
as
soon
as
i
dared
for
i
was
not
accustomed
to
soldiers
and
suggested
that
he
was
forgetting
his
work
it
was
early
in
april
and
the
snow
drifted
through
the
crevices
of
the
old
house
in
banks
upon
our
bed
but
that
was
soon
mended
and
things
began
to
go
smoothly
enough
when
jack
was
ordered
to
join
his
company
which
was
up
at
the
spotted
tail
agency
it
was
expected
that
the
sioux
under
this
chief
would
break
out
at
any
minute
they
had
become
disaffected
about
some
treaty
i
did
not
like
to
be
left
alone
with
the
spiritualist
so
jack
asked
one
of
the
laundresses
whose
husband
was
out
with
the
company
to
come
and
stay
and
take
care
of
me
patten
was
an
old
campaigner
she
understood
everything
about
officers
and
their
ways
and
she
made
me
absolutely
comfortable
for
those
two
lonely
months
i
always
felt
grateful
to
her
she
was
a
dear
old
irish
woman
all
the
families
and
a
few
officers
were
left
at
the
post
and
with
the
daily
drive
to
cheyenne
some
small
dances
and
theatricals
my
time
was
pleasantly
occupied
cheyenne
in
those
early
days
was
an
amusing
but
unattractive
frontier
town
it
presented
a
great
contrast
to
the
old
civilization
i
had
so
recently
left
we
often
saw
women
in
cotton
wrappers
slippers
and
walking
in
the
main
streets
cows
pigs
and
saloons
seemed
to
be
a
feature
of
the
place
in
about
six
weeks
the
affairs
of
the
sioux
were
settled
and
the
troops
returned
to
the
post
the
weather
began
to
be
uncomfortably
hot
in
those
low
wooden
houses
i
missed
the
comforts
of
home
and
the
fresh
sea
air
of
the
coast
but
i
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
our
was
very
small
and
its
one
window
looked
out
over
the
boundless
prairie
at
the
back
of
the
post
on
account
of
the
great
heat
we
were
obliged
to
have
this
window
wide
open
at
night
i
heard
the
cries
and
wails
of
various
animals
but
jack
said
that
was
nothing
they
always
heard
them
once
at
midnight
the
wails
seemed
to
be
nearer
and
i
was
terrified
but
he
told
me
was
only
the
cats
and
coyotes
which
prowled
around
the
post
i
asked
him
if
they
ever
came
in
gracious
no
he
said
they
are
too
wild
i
calmed
myself
for
sleep
when
like
lightning
one
of
the
huge
creatures
gave
a
flying
leap
in
at
our
window
across
the
bed
and
through
into
the
jerusalem
cried
the
lieutenant
and
flew
after
her
snatching
his
sword
which
stood
in
the
corner
and
poking
vigorously
under
the
divan
i
rolled
myself
under
the
in
the
most
abject
terror
lest
she
might
come
back
the
same
way
and
true
enough
she
did
with
a
most
piercing
cry
i
never
had
much
rest
after
that
occurrence
as
we
had
no
protection
against
these
the
regiment
however
in
june
was
ordered
to
arizona
that
dreaded
and
then
unknown
land
and
the
uncertain
future
was
before
me
i
saw
the
other
women
packing
china
and
their
various
belongings
i
seemed
to
be
helpless
jack
was
busy
with
things
outside
he
had
three
large
army
chests
which
were
brought
in
and
placed
before
me
now
he
said
all
our
things
must
go
into
those
chests
and
i
supposed
they
must
i
was
pitifully
ignorant
of
the
details
of
moving
and
i
stood
despairingly
gazing
into
the
depths
of
those
boxes
when
the
jolly
and
stout
wife
of
major
von
hermann
passed
my
window
she
glanced
in
comprehended
the
situation
and
entered
saying
you
do
not
understand
how
to
pack
let
me
help
you
give
me
a
cushion
to
kneel
upon
now
bring
everything
that
is
to
be
packed
and
i
can
soon
show
you
how
to
do
it
with
her
kind
assistance
the
chests
were
packed
and
i
found
that
we
had
a
great
deal
of
surplus
stuff
which
had
to
be
put
into
rough
cases
or
rolled
into
packages
and
covered
with
burlap
jack
fumed
when
he
saw
it
and
declared
we
could
not
take
it
all
as
it
exceeded
our
allowance
of
weight
i
declared
we
must
take
it
or
we
could
not
exist
with
some
concessions
on
both
sides
we
were
finally
packed
up
and
left
fort
russell
about
the
middle
of
june
with
the
first
detachment
consisting
of
and
band
for
san
francisco
over
the
union
pacific
railroad
for
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
there
were
no
railroads
in
arizona
and
all
troops
which
were
sent
to
that
distant
territory
either
marched
through
new
mexico
or
were
transported
by
steamer
from
san
francisco
down
the
coast
and
up
the
gulf
of
california
to
fort
yuma
from
which
point
they
marched
up
the
valley
of
the
gila
to
the
southern
posts
or
continued
up
the
colorado
river
by
steamer
to
other
points
of
disembarkation
whence
they
marched
to
the
posts
in
the
interior
or
the
northern
part
of
the
territory
much
to
my
delight
we
were
allowed
to
remain
over
in
san
francisco
and
go
down
with
the
second
detachment
we
made
the
most
of
the
time
which
was
about
a
fortnight
and
on
the
sixth
of
august
we
embarked
with
six
companies
of
soldiers
lieutenant
colonel
wilkins
in
command
on
the
old
steamship
newbern
captain
metzger
for
arizona
chapter
iv
down
the
pacific
coast
now
the
newbern
was
famous
for
being
a
good
roller
and
she
lived
up
to
her
reputation
for
seven
days
i
saw
only
the
inside
of
our
stateroom
at
the
end
of
that
time
we
arrived
off
cape
lucas
the
extreme
southern
point
of
lower
california
and
i
went
on
deck
we
anchored
and
took
cattle
aboard
i
watched
the
natives
tow
them
off
the
cattle
swimming
behind
their
small
boats
and
then
saw
the
poor
beasts
hoisted
up
by
their
horns
to
the
deck
of
our
ship
i
thought
it
most
dreadfully
cruel
but
was
informed
that
it
had
been
done
from
time
immemorial
so
i
ceased
to
talk
about
it
knowing
that
i
could
not
reform
those
aged
countries
and
realizing
faintly
perhaps
for
i
had
never
seen
much
of
the
rough
side
of
life
that
just
as
cruel
things
were
done
to
the
cattle
we
consume
in
the
north
now
that
sinclair
in
his
great
book
the
jungle
has
brought
the
multiplied
horrors
of
the
great
before
our
very
eyes
we
might
witness
the
hoisting
of
the
cattle
over
the
ship
side
without
feeling
such
intense
pity
admitting
that
everything
is
relative
even
cruelty
it
was
now
the
middle
of
august
and
the
weather
had
become
insufferably
hot
but
we
were
out
of
the
long
swell
of
the
pacific
ocean
we
had
rounded
cape
lucas
and
were
steaming
up
the
gulf
of
california
towards
the
mouth
of
the
great
colorado
whose
red
and
turbulent
waters
empty
themselves
into
this
gulf
at
its
head
i
now
had
time
to
become
acquainted
with
the
officers
of
the
regiment
whom
i
had
not
before
met
they
had
come
in
from
other
posts
and
joined
the
command
at
san
francisco
the
daughter
of
the
was
on
board
the
beautiful
and
graceful
caroline
wilkins
the
belle
of
the
regiment
and
major
worth
to
whose
company
my
husband
belonged
i
took
a
special
interest
in
the
latter
as
i
knew
we
must
face
life
together
in
the
wilds
of
arizona
i
had
time
to
learn
something
about
the
regiment
and
its
history
and
that
major
worth
father
whose
monument
i
had
so
often
seen
in
new
york
was
the
first
colonel
of
the
eighth
infantry
when
it
was
organized
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
party
on
board
was
merry
enough
and
even
gay
there
was
captain
ogilby
a
great
genial
scotchman
and
captain
porter
a
graduate
of
dublin
and
so
charmingly
witty
he
seemed
very
devoted
to
miss
wilkins
but
miss
wilkins
was
accustomed
to
the
devotion
of
all
the
officers
of
the
eighth
infantry
in
fact
it
was
said
that
every
young
lieutenant
who
joined
the
regiment
had
proposed
to
her
she
was
most
attractive
and
as
she
had
too
kind
a
heart
to
be
a
coquette
she
was
a
universal
favorite
with
the
women
as
well
as
with
the
men
there
was
ella
bailey
too
miss
wilkins
sister
with
her
young
and
handsome
husband
and
their
young
baby
then
dear
wilkins
who
had
been
so
many
years
in
the
army
that
she
remembered
crossing
the
plains
in
a
real
she
represented
the
best
type
of
the
older
army
woman
and
it
was
so
lovely
to
see
her
with
her
two
daughters
all
in
the
same
regiment
a
mother
of
daughters
was
not
often
met
with
in
the
army
and
wilkins
a
gentleman
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
a
man
of
rather
quiet
tastes
never
happier
than
when
he
had
leisure
for
indulging
his
musical
taste
in
strumming
all
sorts
of
spanish
fandangos
on
the
guitar
or
his
somewhat
marked
talent
with
the
pencil
and
brush
the
heat
of
the
staterooms
compelled
us
all
to
sleep
on
deck
so
our
mattresses
were
brought
up
by
the
soldiers
at
night
and
spread
about
the
situation
however
was
so
novel
and
altogether
ludicrous
and
our
fear
of
rats
which
ran
about
on
deck
so
great
that
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
before
dawn
we
fled
to
our
staterooms
but
by
sunrise
we
were
glad
to
dress
and
escape
from
their
suffocating
heat
and
go
on
deck
again
black
coffee
and
were
sent
up
and
this
sustained
us
until
the
breakfast
which
was
elaborate
but
not
good
there
was
no
milk
of
course
except
the
heavily
sweetened
sort
which
i
could
not
use
it
was
the
condensed
and
canned
milk
the
meats
were
beyond
everything
except
the
poor
tough
fresh
beef
we
had
seen
hoisted
over
the
side
at
cape
lucas
the
butter
poor
at
the
best
began
to
pour
like
oil
black
coffee
and
bread
and
a
baked
sweet
potato
seemed
the
only
things
that
i
could
swallow
the
heat
in
the
gulf
of
california
was
intense
our
trunks
were
brought
up
from
the
vessel
hold
and
we
took
out
summer
clothing
but
how
inadequate
and
inappropriate
it
was
for
that
climate
our
faces
burned
and
blistered
even
the
parting
on
the
head
burned
under
the
awnings
which
were
kept
spread
the
decreased
alarmingly
the
meats
turned
green
and
when
the
steward
went
down
into
the
refrigerator
which
was
somewhere
below
the
to
get
provisions
for
the
day
every
woman
held
a
bottle
of
salts
to
her
nose
and
the
officers
fled
to
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
the
odor
which
ascended
from
that
refrigerator
was
indescribable
it
lingered
and
would
not
go
it
followed
us
to
the
table
and
when
we
tasted
the
food
we
tasted
the
odor
we
bribed
the
steward
for
ice
finally
i
could
not
go
below
at
all
but
had
a
baked
sweet
potato
brought
on
deck
and
lived
several
days
upon
that
diet
on
the
of
august
we
anchored
off
mazatlan
a
picturesque
and
ancient
adobe
town
in
old
mexico
the
approach
to
this
port
was
strikingly
beautiful
great
rocks
cut
by
the
surf
into
arches
and
caverns
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
harbor
we
anchored
two
miles
out
a
customs
and
a
boat
boarded
us
and
many
natives
came
along
side
bringing
fresh
cocoanuts
bananas
and
limes
some
mexicans
bound
for
guaymas
came
on
board
and
a
troupe
of
japanese
jugglers
while
we
were
unloading
cargo
some
officers
and
their
wives
went
on
shore
in
one
of
the
ship
boats
and
found
it
a
most
interesting
place
it
was
garrisoned
by
mexican
troops
uniformed
in
white
cotton
shirts
and
trousers
they
visited
the
old
hotel
the
amphitheatre
where
the
were
held
and
the
old
fort
they
told
also
about
the
and
about
the
refreshing
drinks
they
had
my
thirst
began
to
be
abnormal
we
bought
a
dozen
cocoanuts
and
i
drank
the
milk
from
them
and
made
up
my
mind
to
go
ashore
at
the
next
port
for
after
nine
days
with
only
thick
black
coffee
and
bad
warm
water
to
drink
i
was
longing
for
a
cup
of
good
tea
or
a
glass
of
fresh
sweet
milk
a
day
or
so
more
brought
us
to
guaymas
another
mexican
port
wilkins
said
she
had
heard
something
about
an
old
spaniard
there
who
used
to
cook
meals
for
stray
travellers
this
was
enough
i
was
desperately
hungry
and
thirsty
and
we
decided
to
try
and
find
him
wilkins
spoke
a
little
spanish
and
by
dint
of
inquiries
we
found
the
man
house
a
little
old
forlorn
adobe
casa
we
rapped
vigorously
upon
the
old
door
and
after
some
minutes
a
small
withered
old
man
appeared
wilkins
told
him
what
we
wanted
but
this
ancient
delmonico
declined
to
serve
us
and
said
in
spanish
the
country
was
a
desert
he
had
nothing
in
the
house
he
had
not
cooked
a
meal
in
years
he
could
not
and
finally
he
would
not
and
he
gently
pushed
the
door
to
in
our
faces
but
we
did
not
give
it
up
and
wilkins
continued
to
persuade
i
mustered
what
spanish
i
knew
and
told
him
i
would
pay
him
any
price
for
a
cup
of
coffee
with
fresh
milk
he
finally
yielded
and
told
us
to
return
in
one
hour
so
we
walked
around
the
little
deserted
town
i
could
think
only
of
the
breakfast
we
were
to
have
in
the
old
man
casa
and
it
met
and
exceeded
our
wildest
anticipations
for
just
fancy
we
were
served
with
a
delicious
boullion
then
chicken
perfectly
cooked
accompanied
by
some
dish
flavored
with
chile
verde
creamy
biscuit
fresh
butter
and
golden
coffee
with
milk
there
were
three
or
four
women
and
several
officers
in
the
party
and
we
had
a
merry
breakfast
we
paid
the
old
man
generously
thanked
him
warmly
and
returned
to
the
ship
fortified
to
endure
the
sight
of
all
the
green
ducks
that
came
out
of
the
lower
hold
you
must
remember
that
the
newbern
was
a
small
and
old
propeller
not
fitted
up
for
passengers
and
in
those
days
the
great
refrigerating
plants
were
unheard
of
the
women
who
go
to
the
philippines
on
our
great
transports
of
can
not
realize
and
will
scarcely
believe
what
we
endured
for
lack
of
ice
and
of
good
food
on
that
voyage
down
the
pacific
coast
and
up
the
gulf
of
california
in
the
summer
of
chapter
the
slue
at
last
after
a
voyage
of
thirteen
days
we
came
to
anchor
a
mile
or
so
off
port
isabel
at
the
mouth
of
the
colorado
river
a
narrow
but
deep
slue
runs
up
into
the
desert
land
on
the
east
side
of
the
mouth
and
provides
a
harbor
of
refuge
for
the
which
meet
the
ocean
steamers
at
this
point
hurricanes
are
prevalent
at
this
season
in
the
gulf
of
california
but
we
had
been
fortunate
in
not
meeting
with
any
on
the
voyage
the
wind
now
freshened
however
and
beat
the
waves
into
angry
foam
and
there
we
lay
for
three
days
on
the
newbern
off
port
isabel
before
the
sea
was
calm
enough
for
the
transfer
of
troops
and
baggage
to
the
lighters
this
was
excessively
disagreeable
the
wind
was
like
a
breath
from
a
furnace
it
seemed
as
though
the
days
would
never
end
and
the
wind
never
stop
blowing
jack
official
diary
says
one
soldier
died
finally
on
the
fourth
day
the
wind
abated
and
the
transfer
was
begun
we
boarded
the
river
steamboat
cocopah
towing
a
barge
loaded
with
soldiers
and
steamed
away
for
the
slue
i
must
say
that
we
welcomed
the
change
with
delight
towards
the
end
of
the
afternoon
the
cocopah
put
her
nose
to
the
shore
and
tied
up
it
seemed
strange
not
to
see
pier
sand
docks
nor
even
piles
to
tie
to
anchors
were
taken
ashore
and
the
boat
secured
in
that
manner
there
being
no
trees
of
sufficient
size
to
make
fast
to
the
soldiers
went
into
camp
on
shore
the
heat
down
in
that
low
flat
place
was
intense
another
man
died
that
night
what
was
our
chagrin
the
next
morning
to
learn
that
we
must
go
back
to
the
newbern
to
carry
some
freight
from
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
stay
on
board
and
tow
that
dreary
barge
filled
with
hot
red
ore
out
to
the
ship
unload
and
go
back
up
the
slue
jack
diary
records
heat
awful
pringle
died
he
was
the
third
soldier
to
succumb
it
seemed
to
me
their
fate
was
a
hard
one
to
die
down
in
that
wretched
place
to
be
rolled
in
a
blanket
and
buried
on
those
desert
shores
with
nothing
but
a
heap
of
stones
to
mark
their
graves
the
adjutant
of
the
battalion
read
the
burial
service
and
the
trumpeters
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
graves
and
sounded
taps
which
echoed
sad
and
melancholy
far
over
those
parched
and
arid
lands
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
for
one
of
the
soldiers
was
from
our
own
company
and
had
been
kind
to
me
jack
said
you
must
cry
mattie
it
a
soldier
life
and
when
a
man
enlists
he
must
take
his
chances
yes
but
i
said
somewhere
there
must
be
a
mother
or
sister
or
some
one
who
cares
for
these
poor
men
and
it
all
so
sad
to
think
of
well
i
know
it
is
sad
he
replied
soothingly
but
listen
it
is
all
over
and
the
burial
party
is
returning
i
listened
and
heard
the
gay
strains
of
the
girl
i
left
behind
me
which
the
trumpeters
were
playing
with
all
their
might
you
see
said
jack
it
would
not
do
for
the
soldiers
to
be
sad
when
one
of
them
dies
why
it
would
demoralize
the
whole
command
so
they
play
these
gay
things
to
cheer
them
up
and
i
began
to
feel
that
tears
must
be
out
of
place
at
a
funeral
i
attended
many
a
one
after
that
but
i
had
too
much
imagination
and
in
spite
of
all
my
brave
efforts
visions
of
the
poor
boy
mother
on
some
little
farm
in
missouri
or
kansas
perhaps
or
in
some
new
england
town
or
possibly
in
the
old
country
would
come
before
me
and
my
heart
was
filled
with
sadness
the
post
hospital
seemed
to
me
a
lonesome
place
to
die
in
although
the
surgeon
and
soldier
attendants
were
kind
to
the
sick
men
there
were
no
women
nurses
in
the
army
in
those
days
the
next
day
the
cocopah
started
again
and
towed
a
barge
out
to
the
ship
but
the
hot
wind
sprang
up
and
blew
fiercely
and
we
lay
off
and
on
all
day
until
it
was
calm
enough
to
tow
her
back
to
the
slue
by
that
time
i
had
about
given
up
all
hope
of
getting
any
farther
and
if
the
weather
had
only
been
cooler
i
could
have
endured
with
equanimity
the
idle
life
and
knocking
about
from
the
ship
to
the
slue
and
from
the
slue
to
the
ship
but
the
heat
was
unbearable
we
had
to
unpack
our
trunks
again
and
get
out
shoes
for
the
zinc
which
covered
the
decks
of
these
burned
through
the
thin
slippers
we
had
worn
on
the
ship
that
day
we
had
a
little
diversion
for
we
saw
the
gila
come
down
the
river
and
up
the
slue
and
tie
up
directly
alongside
of
us
she
had
on
board
and
in
barges
four
companies
of
the
infantry
who
were
going
into
the
states
we
exchanged
greetings
and
visits
and
from
the
great
joy
manifested
by
them
all
i
drew
my
conclusions
as
to
what
lay
before
us
in
the
dry
and
desolate
country
we
were
about
to
enter
the
women
clothes
looked
ridiculously
and
i
wondered
if
i
should
look
that
way
when
my
time
came
to
leave
arizona
little
cared
they
those
women
of
the
for
joy
upon
joys
they
saw
the
newbern
out
there
in
the
offing
waiting
to
take
them
back
to
green
hills
and
to
cool
days
and
nights
and
to
those
they
had
left
behind
three
years
before
on
account
of
the
wind
which
blew
again
with
great
violence
the
cocopah
could
not
leave
the
slue
that
day
the
officers
and
soldiers
were
desperate
for
something
to
do
so
they
tried
fishing
and
caught
some
croakers
which
tasted
very
fresh
and
good
after
all
the
curried
and
messes
we
had
been
obliged
to
eat
on
board
ship
we
spent
seven
days
in
and
out
of
that
slue
finally
on
august
the
the
wind
subsided
and
we
started
up
river
towards
sunset
we
arrived
at
a
place
called
old
soldier
camp
there
the
gila
joined
us
and
the
command
was
divided
between
the
two
we
were
assigned
to
the
gila
and
i
settled
myself
down
with
my
belongings
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
up
river
we
resigned
ourselves
to
the
dreadful
heat
and
at
the
end
of
two
more
days
the
river
had
begun
to
narrow
and
we
arrived
at
fort
yuma
which
was
at
that
time
the
post
best
known
to
and
most
talked
about
by
army
officers
of
any
in
arizona
no
one
except
old
campaigners
knew
much
about
any
other
post
in
the
territory
it
was
said
to
be
the
very
hottest
place
that
ever
existed
and
from
the
time
we
left
san
francisco
we
had
heard
the
story
oft
repeated
of
the
poor
soldier
who
died
at
fort
yuma
and
after
awhile
returned
to
beg
for
his
blankets
having
found
the
regions
of
pluto
so
much
cooler
than
the
place
he
had
left
but
the
fort
looked
pleasant
to
us
as
we
approached
it
lay
on
a
high
mesa
to
the
left
of
us
and
there
was
a
little
green
grass
where
the
post
was
built
none
of
the
officers
knew
as
yet
their
destination
and
i
found
myself
wishing
it
might
be
our
good
fortune
to
stay
at
fort
yuma
it
seemed
such
a
friendly
place
lieutenant
haskell
twelfth
infantry
who
was
stationed
there
came
down
to
the
boat
to
greet
us
and
brought
us
our
letters
from
home
he
then
extended
his
gracious
hospitality
to
us
all
arranging
for
us
to
come
to
his
quarters
the
next
day
for
a
meal
and
dividing
the
party
as
best
he
could
accommodate
us
it
fell
to
our
lot
to
go
to
breakfast
with
major
and
wells
and
miss
wilkins
an
ambulance
was
sent
the
next
morning
at
nine
to
bring
us
up
the
steep
and
winding
road
white
with
heat
which
led
to
the
fort
i
can
never
forget
the
taste
of
the
oatmeal
with
fresh
milk
the
eggs
and
butter
and
delicious
tomatoes
which
were
served
to
us
in
his
latticed
after
days
of
heat
and
glare
and
scorching
winds
and
stale
food
fort
yuma
and
haskell
seemed
like
paradise
of
course
it
was
hot
it
was
august
and
we
expected
it
but
the
heat
of
those
places
can
be
much
alleviated
by
the
surroundings
there
were
shower
baths
and
latticed
piazzas
and
large
ollas
hanging
in
the
shade
of
them
containing
cool
water
yuma
was
only
twenty
days
from
san
francisco
and
they
were
able
to
get
many
things
direct
by
steamer
of
course
there
was
no
ice
and
butter
was
kept
only
by
ingenious
devices
of
the
chinese
servants
there
were
but
few
vegetables
but
what
was
to
be
had
at
all
in
that
country
was
to
be
had
at
fort
yuma
we
staid
one
more
day
and
left
two
companies
of
the
regiment
there
when
we
departed
i
felt
somehow
as
though
we
were
saying
to
the
world
and
civilization
and
as
our
boat
clattered
and
tugged
away
up
river
with
its
great
wheel
astern
i
could
not
help
looking
back
longingly
to
old
fort
yuma
chapter
vi
up
the
rio
colorado
and
now
began
our
real
journey
up
the
colorado
river
that
river
unknown
to
me
except
in
my
early
geography
lessons
that
mighty
and
untamed
river
which
is
unknown
except
to
the
explorer
or
the
few
people
who
have
navigated
its
turbulent
waters
back
in
memory
was
the
picture
of
it
on
the
map
here
was
the
reality
then
and
here
we
were
on
the
steamer
gila
captain
mellon
with
the
barge
full
of
soldiers
towing
on
after
us
starting
for
fort
mojave
some
two
hundred
miles
above
the
vague
and
shadowy
foreboding
that
had
fluttered
through
my
mind
before
i
left
fort
russell
had
now
also
become
a
reality
and
crowded
out
every
other
thought
the
river
the
scenery
seemed
after
all
but
an
illusion
and
interested
me
but
in
a
dreamy
sort
of
way
we
had
staterooms
but
could
not
remain
in
them
long
at
a
time
on
account
of
the
intense
heat
i
had
never
felt
such
heat
and
no
one
else
ever
had
or
has
since
the
days
were
interminable
we
wandered
around
the
boat
first
forward
then
aft
to
find
a
cool
spot
we
hung
up
our
canteens
covered
with
flannel
and
dipped
in
water
where
they
would
swing
in
the
shade
thereby
obtaining
water
which
was
a
trifle
cooler
than
the
air
there
was
no
ice
and
consequently
no
fresh
provisions
a
chinaman
served
as
steward
and
cook
and
at
the
ringing
of
a
bell
we
all
went
into
a
small
saloon
back
of
the
pilothouse
where
the
meals
were
served
our
party
at
table
on
the
gila
consisted
of
several
unmarried
officers
and
several
officers
with
their
wives
about
eight
or
nine
in
all
and
we
could
have
had
a
merry
time
enough
but
for
the
awful
heat
which
destroyed
both
our
good
looks
and
our
tempers
the
fare
was
meagre
of
course
fresh
biscuit
without
butter
very
salt
boiled
beef
and
some
canned
vegetables
which
were
poor
enough
in
those
days
pies
made
from
preserved
peaches
or
plums
generally
followed
this
delectable
course
chinamen
as
we
all
know
can
make
pies
under
conditions
that
would
stagger
most
chefs
they
may
have
no
marble
and
the
lard
may
run
like
oil
still
they
can
make
pies
that
taste
good
to
the
hungry
traveller
but
that
was
hot
the
metal
handles
of
the
knives
were
uncomfortably
warm
to
the
touch
and
even
the
wooden
arms
of
the
chairs
felt
as
if
they
were
slowly
igniting
after
a
hasty
meal
and
a
few
remarks
upon
the
salt
beef
and
the
general
misery
of
our
lot
we
would
seek
some
spot
which
might
be
a
trifle
cooler
a
siesta
was
out
of
the
question
as
the
staterooms
were
insufferable
and
so
we
dragged
out
the
weary
days
at
sundown
the
boat
put
her
nose
up
to
the
bank
and
tied
up
for
the
night
the
soldiers
left
the
barges
and
went
into
camp
on
shore
to
cook
their
suppers
and
to
sleep
the
banks
of
the
river
offered
no
very
attractive
spot
upon
which
to
make
a
camp
they
were
low
flat
and
covered
with
underbrush
and
which
grew
thick
to
the
edge
i
always
found
it
interesting
to
watch
the
barge
unload
the
men
at
sundown
at
twilight
some
of
the
soldiers
came
on
board
and
laid
our
mattresses
side
by
side
on
the
after
deck
pajamas
and
loose
gowns
were
soon
en
evidence
but
nothing
mattered
as
they
were
no
electric
lights
to
disturb
us
with
their
glare
rank
also
mattered
not
wilkins
and
his
wife
lay
down
to
rest
with
the
captains
and
lieutenants
and
their
wives
wherever
their
respective
strikers
had
placed
their
mattresses
for
this
was
the
good
old
time
when
the
soldiers
were
allowed
to
wait
upon
officers
under
these
circumstances
much
sleep
was
not
to
be
thought
of
the
sultry
heat
by
the
river
bank
and
the
pungent
smell
of
the
which
lined
the
shores
thickly
contributed
more
to
stimulate
than
to
soothe
the
weary
nerves
but
the
glare
of
the
sun
was
gone
and
after
awhile
a
stillness
settled
down
upon
this
company
of
uncle
servants
and
their
followers
in
the
army
regulations
wives
are
not
rated
except
as
camp
followers
but
even
this
short
respite
from
the
glare
of
the
sun
was
soon
to
end
for
before
the
crack
of
dawn
or
as
it
seemed
to
us
shortly
after
midnight
came
such
a
clatter
with
the
fires
and
the
engine
and
the
sparks
and
what
all
they
did
in
that
wild
and
reckless
land
that
further
rest
was
impossible
and
we
betook
ourselves
with
our
mattresses
to
the
staterooms
for
another
attempt
at
sleep
which
however
meant
only
failure
as
the
sun
rose
incredibly
early
on
that
river
and
we
were
glad
to
take
a
hasty
sponge
from
a
basin
of
rather
thick
looking
and
go
again
out
on
deck
where
we
could
always
get
a
cup
of
black
coffee
from
the
chinaman
and
thus
began
another
day
of
intolerable
glare
and
heat
conversation
lagged
no
topic
seemed
to
have
any
interest
except
the
thermometer
which
hung
in
the
coolest
place
on
the
boat
and
one
day
when
major
worth
looked
at
it
and
pronounced
it
one
hundred
and
in
the
shade
a
grim
despair
seized
upon
me
and
i
wondered
how
much
more
heat
human
beings
could
endure
there
was
nothing
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
the
scenery
on
each
side
of
us
low
river
banks
and
nothing
between
those
and
the
horizon
line
on
our
left
was
lower
california
and
on
our
right
arizona
both
appeared
to
be
deserts
this
term
is
here
used
as
we
used
it
at
ehrenberg
to
designate
the
low
flat
lands
west
of
the
river
without
any
reference
to
lower
california
proper
the
long
peninsula
belonging
to
mexico
as
the
river
narrowed
however
the
trip
began
to
be
enlivened
by
the
constant
danger
of
getting
aground
on
the
shifting
which
are
so
numerous
in
this
mighty
river
jack
mellon
was
then
the
most
famous
pilot
on
the
colorado
and
he
was
very
skilful
in
steering
clear
of
the
skimming
over
them
or
working
his
boat
off
when
once
fast
upon
them
the
men
of
a
mixed
indian
and
mexican
race
stood
ready
with
long
poles
in
the
bow
to
jump
overboard
when
we
struck
a
bar
and
by
dint
of
pushing
and
reversing
the
engine
the
boat
would
swing
off
on
approaching
a
shallow
place
they
would
sound
with
their
poles
and
in
a
tone
drawl
out
the
number
of
feet
sometimes
their
sleepy
drawling
tones
would
suddenly
cease
and
crying
loudly
no
alli
agua
they
would
swing
themselves
over
the
side
of
the
boat
into
the
river
and
begin
their
strange
and
intricate
manipulations
with
the
poles
then
again
they
would
carry
the
anchor
away
off
and
by
means
of
great
spars
and
some
method
too
complicated
for
me
to
describe
captain
mellon
would
fairly
lift
the
boat
over
the
bar
but
our
progress
was
naturally
much
retarded
and
sometimes
we
were
aground
an
hour
sometimes
a
half
day
or
more
captain
mellon
was
always
cheerful
river
steamboating
was
his
life
and
were
his
excitement
on
one
occasion
i
said
oh
captain
do
you
think
we
shall
get
off
this
bar
well
you
ca
tell
he
said
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
one
trip
i
lay
days
on
a
bar
and
then
after
a
short
pause
but
that
do
happen
very
often
we
sometimes
lay
a
week
though
there
is
no
telling
the
bars
change
all
the
time
sometimes
the
low
trees
and
brushwood
on
the
banks
parted
and
a
young
squaw
would
peer
out
at
us
this
was
a
little
diversion
and
picturesque
besides
they
wore
very
short
skirts
made
of
stripped
bark
and
as
they
held
back
the
branches
of
the
low
willows
and
looked
at
us
with
curiosity
they
made
pictures
so
pretty
that
i
have
never
forgotten
them
we
had
no
kodaks
then
but
even
if
we
had
had
them
they
could
not
have
reproduced
the
fine
copper
color
of
those
bare
shoulders
and
arms
the
soft
wood
colors
of
the
short
bark
skirts
the
gleam
of
the
sun
upon
their
hair
and
the
turquoise
color
of
the
wide
which
encircled
their
arms
one
morning
as
i
was
trying
to
finish
out
a
nap
in
my
stateroom
jack
came
excitedly
in
and
said
get
up
martha
we
are
coming
to
ehrenberg
visions
of
castles
on
the
rhine
and
stories
of
the
middle
ages
floated
through
my
mind
as
i
sprang
up
in
pleasurable
anticipation
of
seeing
an
interesting
and
beautiful
place
alas
for
my
ignorance
i
saw
but
a
row
of
low
thatched
hovels
perched
on
the
edge
of
the
ragged
looking
a
road
ran
lengthwise
along
and
opposite
the
hovels
i
saw
a
store
and
some
more
huts
of
adobe
oh
jack
i
cried
and
is
that
ehrenberg
who
on
earth
gave
such
a
name
to
the
wretched
place
oh
some
old
german
prospector
i
suppose
but
never
mind
the
place
is
all
right
enough
come
hurry
up
we
are
going
to
stop
here
and
land
freight
there
is
an
officer
stationed
here
see
those
low
white
walls
that
is
where
he
lives
captain
bernard
of
the
fifth
cavalry
it
quite
a
place
come
out
and
see
it
but
i
did
not
go
ashore
of
all
dreary
settlements
that
one
could
possibly
imagine
that
was
the
worst
an
unfriendly
dirty
and
place
inhabited
by
a
poor
class
of
mexicans
and
it
was
however
an
important
shipping
station
for
freight
which
was
to
be
sent
overland
to
the
interior
and
there
was
always
one
army
officer
stationed
there
captain
bernard
came
on
board
to
see
us
i
did
not
ask
him
how
he
liked
his
station
it
seemed
to
me
too
satirical
like
asking
the
prisoner
of
chillon
for
instance
how
he
liked
his
dungeon
i
looked
over
towards
those
low
white
walls
which
enclosed
the
government
corral
and
the
habitation
of
this
officer
and
thanked
my
stars
that
no
such
dreadful
detail
had
come
to
my
husband
i
did
not
dream
that
in
less
than
a
year
this
exceptionally
hard
fate
was
to
be
my
own
we
left
ehrenberg
with
no
regrets
and
pushed
on
up
river
on
the
third
of
september
the
boilers
foamed
so
that
we
had
to
tie
up
for
nearly
a
day
this
was
caused
by
the
water
being
so
very
muddy
the
rio
colorado
deserves
its
name
for
its
current
sweeps
by
like
a
mass
of
seething
red
liquid
turbulent
and
thick
and
treacherous
it
was
said
on
the
river
that
those
who
sank
beneath
its
surface
were
never
seen
again
and
in
looking
over
into
those
whirlpools
and
swirling
eddies
one
might
well
believe
this
to
be
true
from
there
on
up
the
river
we
passed
through
great
canons
and
the
scenery
was
grand
enough
but
one
can
not
enjoy
scenery
with
the
mercury
ranging
from
to
in
the
shade
the
grandeur
was
quite
lost
upon
us
all
and
we
were
suffocated
by
the
scorching
heat
radiating
from
those
massive
walls
of
rocks
between
which
we
puffed
and
clattered
along
i
must
confess
that
the
history
of
this
great
river
was
quite
unknown
to
me
then
i
had
never
read
of
the
early
attempts
made
to
explore
it
both
from
above
and
from
its
mouth
and
the
wonders
of
the
grand
canon
were
as
yet
unknown
to
the
world
i
did
not
realize
that
as
we
steamed
along
between
those
high
perpendicular
walls
of
rock
we
were
really
seeing
the
lower
end
of
that
great
chasm
which
now
thirty
years
later
has
become
one
of
the
most
famous
resorts
of
this
country
and
in
fact
of
the
world
there
was
some
mention
made
of
major
powell
that
daring
adventurer
who
a
few
years
previously
had
accomplished
the
marvellous
feat
of
going
down
the
colorado
and
through
the
grand
canon
in
a
small
boat
he
being
the
first
man
who
had
at
that
time
ever
accomplished
it
many
men
having
lost
their
lives
in
the
attempt
at
last
on
the
of
september
we
arrived
at
camp
mojave
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
a
low
square
enclosure
on
the
low
level
of
the
flat
land
near
the
river
it
seemed
an
age
since
we
had
left
yuma
and
twice
an
age
since
we
had
left
the
mouth
of
the
river
but
it
was
only
eighteen
days
in
all
and
captain
mellon
remarked
a
quick
trip
and
congratulated
us
on
the
good
luck
we
had
had
in
not
being
detained
on
the
sandbars
great
heavens
i
thought
if
that
is
what
they
call
a
quick
trip
but
i
do
not
know
just
what
i
thought
for
those
eighteen
days
on
the
great
colorado
in
midsummer
had
burned
themselves
into
my
memory
and
i
made
an
inward
vow
that
nothing
would
ever
force
me
into
such
a
situation
again
i
did
not
stop
to
really
think
i
only
felt
and
my
only
feeling
was
a
desire
to
get
cool
and
to
get
out
of
the
territory
in
some
other
way
and
at
some
cooler
season
how
futile
a
wish
and
how
futile
a
vow
dellenbaugh
who
was
with
powell
in
in
his
second
expedition
down
the
river
in
small
boats
has
given
to
the
world
a
most
interesting
account
of
this
wonderful
river
and
the
canons
through
which
it
cuts
its
tempestuous
way
to
the
gulf
of
california
in
two
volumes
entitled
the
romance
of
the
great
colorado
and
a
canon
voyage
we
bade
to
our
gallant
river
captain
and
watched
the
great
as
she
swung
out
into
the
stream
and
heading
up
river
disappeared
around
a
bend
for
even
at
that
time
this
venturesome
pilot
had
pushed
his
boat
farther
up
than
any
other
had
ever
gone
and
we
heard
that
there
were
terrific
rapids
and
falls
and
unknown
mysteries
above
the
superstition
of
centuries
hovered
over
the
great
cut
and
but
few
civilized
beings
had
looked
down
into
its
awful
depths
brave
dashing
handsome
jack
mellon
what
would
i
give
and
what
would
we
all
give
to
see
thee
once
more
thou
wizard
of
the
great
colorado
we
turned
our
faces
towards
the
mojave
desert
and
i
wondered
what
next
the
post
surgeon
kindly
took
care
of
us
for
two
days
and
nights
and
we
slept
upon
the
broad
piazzas
of
his
quarters
we
heard
no
more
the
crackling
and
fizzing
of
the
engines
at
daylight
and
our
eyes
tired
with
gazing
at
the
red
whirlpools
of
the
river
found
relief
in
looking
out
upon
the
flat
expanse
which
surrounded
fort
mojave
and
merged
itself
into
the
desert
beyond

yes
thou
art

joaquin
miller
the
country
had
grown
steadily
more
unfriendly
ever
since
leaving
fort
yuma
and
the
surroundings
of
camp
mojave
were
dreary
enough
but
we
took
time
to
sort
out
our
belongings
and
the
officers
arranged
for
transportation
across
the
territory
some
had
bought
in
san
francisco
comfortable
for
their
families
they
were
old
campaigners
they
knew
a
thing
or
two
about
arizona
we
lieutenants
did
not
know
we
had
never
heard
much
about
this
part
of
our
country
but
a
comfortable
large
carriage
known
as
a
dougherty
wagon
or
in
common
army
parlance
an
ambulance
was
secured
for
me
to
travel
in
this
vehicle
had
a
large
body
with
two
seats
facing
each
other
and
a
seat
outside
for
the
driver
the
inside
of
the
wagon
could
be
closed
if
desired
by
canvas
sides
and
back
which
rolled
up
and
down
and
by
a
curtain
which
dropped
behind
the
driver
seat
so
i
was
enabled
to
have
some
degree
of
privacy
if
i
wished
we
repacked
our
and
bought
from
the
commissary
at
mojave
the
provisions
necessary
for
the
long
journey
to
fort
whipple
which
was
the
destination
of
one
of
the
companies
and
the
headquarters
officers
on
the
morning
of
september
everything
in
the
post
was
astir
with
preparations
for
the
first
march
it
was
now
days
since
we
left
san
francisco
but
the
change
from
boat
to
land
travelling
offered
an
agreeable
diversion
after
the
monotony
of
the
river
i
watched
with
interest
the
loading
of
the
great
into
which
went
the
soldiers
boxes
and
the
camp
equipage
outside
was
lashed
a
good
deal
of
the
lighter
stuff
i
noticed
a
barrel
of
china
which
looked
much
like
our
own
lashed
directly
over
one
wheel
then
there
were
the
massive
blue
army
wagons
which
were
also
heavily
loaded
the
laundresses
with
their
children
and
belongings
were
placed
in
these
at
last
the
command
moved
out
it
was
to
me
a
novel
sight
the
wagons
and
schooners
were
each
drawn
by
teams
of
six
heavy
mules
while
a
team
of
six
lighter
mules
was
put
to
each
ambulance
and
carriage
these
were
quite
different
from
the
draught
animals
i
had
always
seen
in
the
eastern
states
these
government
mules
being
sleek
and
trained
to
trot
as
fast
as
the
average
the
harnesses
were
quite
smart
being
trimmed
off
with
white
ivory
rings
each
mule
was
lize
or
fanny
or
kate
and
the
soldiers
who
handled
the
lines
were
accustomed
to
the
work
for
work
and
arduous
work
it
proved
to
be
as
we
advanced
into
the
then
unknown
territory
of
arizona
the
main
body
of
the
troops
marched
in
advance
then
came
the
ambulances
and
carriages
followed
by
the
and
a
small
when
the
troops
were
halted
once
an
hour
for
rest
the
officers
who
marched
with
the
soldiers
would
come
to
the
ambulances
and
chat
awhile
until
the
bugle
call
for
assembly
sounded
when
they
would
join
their
commands
again
the
men
would
fall
in
the
call
forward
was
sounded
and
the
army
train
moved
on
the
first
day
march
was
over
a
dreary
country
a
hot
wind
blew
and
everything
was
filled
with
dust
i
had
long
ago
discarded
my
hat
as
an
unnecessary
and
troublesome
article
consequently
my
head
wa
snow
a
mass
of
fine
white
dust
which
stuck
fast
of
course
i
was
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
it
and
it
would
not
shake
off
so
although
our
steamboat
troubles
were
over
our
land
troubles
had
begun
we
reached
after
a
few
hours
travel
the
desolate
place
where
we
were
to
camp
in
the
mean
time
it
had
been
arranged
for
major
worth
who
had
no
family
to
share
our
mess
and
we
had
secured
the
services
of
a
soldier
belonging
to
his
company
whose
ability
as
a
camp
cook
was
known
to
both
officers
i
can
not
say
that
life
in
the
army
as
far
as
i
had
gone
presented
any
very
great
attractions
this
our
first
camp
was
on
the
river
a
little
above
hardyville
good
water
was
there
and
that
was
all
i
had
not
yet
learned
to
appreciate
that
there
was
not
a
tree
nor
a
shrub
to
give
shade
the
only
thing
i
could
see
except
sky
and
sand
was
a
ruined
adobe
enclosure
with
no
roof
i
sat
in
the
ambulance
until
our
tent
was
pitched
and
then
jack
came
to
me
followed
by
a
soldier
and
said
mattie
this
is
bowen
our
striker
now
i
want
you
to
tell
him
what
he
shall
cook
for
our
supper
and
do
you
think
it
would
be
nice
if
you
could
show
him
how
to
make
some
of
those
good
new
england
doughnuts
i
think
major
worth
might
like
them
and
after
all
the
awful
stuff
we
have
had
you
know
et
caetera
et
caetera
i
met
the
situation
after
an
inward
struggle
and
said
weakly
where
are
the
eggs
oh
said
he
you
do
need
eggs
you
on
the
frontier
now
you
must
learn
to
do
without
eggs
everything
in
me
rebelled
but
still
i
yielded
you
see
i
had
been
married
only
six
months
the
women
at
home
and
in
germany
also
had
always
shown
great
deference
to
their
husbands
wishes
but
at
that
moment
i
almost
wished
major
worth
and
jack
and
bowen
and
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
rio
colorado
however
i
nerved
myself
for
the
effort
and
when
bowen
had
his
made
he
came
and
called
me
at
the
best
i
never
had
much
confidence
in
my
ability
as
a
cook
but
as
a
camp
cook
ah
me
everything
seemed
to
swim
before
my
eyes
and
i
fancied
that
the
other
women
were
looking
at
me
from
their
tents
bowen
was
very
civil
turned
back
the
cover
of
the
and
propped
it
up
that
was
the
table
then
he
brought
me
a
tin
basin
and
some
flour
some
condensed
milk
some
sugar
and
a
and
then
he
hung
a
with
lard
in
it
over
the
fire
i
stirred
up
a
mixture
in
the
basin
but
the
humiliation
of
failure
was
spared
me
for
just
then
without
warning
came
one
of
those
terrific
sandstorms
which
prevail
on
the
deserts
of
arizona
blowing
us
all
before
it
in
its
fury
and
filling
everything
with
sand
we
all
scurried
to
the
tents
some
of
them
had
blown
down
there
was
not
much
shelter
but
the
storm
was
soon
over
and
we
stood
collecting
our
scattered
senses
i
saw
wilkins
at
the
door
of
her
tent
she
beckoned
to
me
i
went
over
there
and
she
said
now
my
dear
i
am
going
to
give
you
some
advice
you
must
not
take
it
unkindly
i
am
an
old
army
woman
and
i
have
made
many
campaigns
with
the
colonel
you
have
but
just
joined
the
army
you
must
never
try
to
do
any
cooking
at
the
the
soldiers
are
there
for
that
work
and
they
know
lots
more
about
it
than
any
of
us
do
but
jack
i
began
never
mind
jack
said
she
he
does
not
know
as
much
as
i
do
about
it
and
when
you
reach
your
post
she
added
you
can
show
him
what
you
can
do
in
that
line
bowen
cleared
away
the
sandy
remains
of
the
doubtful
dough
and
prepared
for
us
a
very
fair
supper
soldiers
bacon
and
coffee
and
biscuits
baked
in
a
dutch
oven
while
waiting
for
the
sun
to
set
we
took
a
short
stroll
over
to
the
adobe
ruins
inside
the
enclosure
lay
an
enormous
rattlesnake
coiled
it
was
the
first
one
i
had
ever
seen
except
in
a
cage
and
i
was
fascinated
by
the
horror
of
the
round
heap
so
near
the
color
of
the
sand
on
which
it
lay
some
soldiers
came
and
killed
it
but
i
noticed
that
bowen
took
extra
pains
that
night
to
spread
buffalo
robes
under
our
mattresses
and
to
place
around
them
a
hair
lariat
snakes
wo
cross
over
that
he
said
with
a
grin
bowen
was
a
character
originally
from
some
farm
in
vermont
he
had
served
some
years
with
the
eighth
infantry
and
for
a
long
time
in
the
same
company
under
major
worth
and
had
cooked
for
the
bachelors
mess
he
was
very
tall
and
had
a
face
but
he
did
not
have
much
opinion
of
what
is
known
as
etiquette
either
military
or
civil
he
seemed
to
consider
himself
a
sort
of
protector
to
the
officers
of
company
k
and
now
as
well
to
the
woman
who
had
joined
the
company
he
took
us
all
under
his
wing
as
it
were
and
although
he
had
to
be
sharply
reprimanded
sometimes
in
a
kind
of
language
which
he
seemed
to
expect
he
was
allowed
more
latitude
than
most
soldiers
this
was
my
first
night
under
canvas
in
the
army
i
did
not
like
those
desert
places
and
they
grew
to
have
a
horror
for
me
at
four
in
the
morning
the
cook
call
sounded
the
mules
were
fed
and
the
crunching
and
the
braying
were
something
to
awaken
the
heaviest
sleepers
bowen
called
us
i
was
much
upset
by
the
dreadful
dust
which
was
thick
upon
everything
i
touched
we
had
to
hasten
our
toilet
as
they
were
striking
tents
and
breaking
camp
early
in
order
to
reach
before
noon
the
next
place
where
there
was
water
sitting
on
around
the
in
the
open
before
the
break
of
day
we
swallowed
some
black
coffee
and
ate
some
rather
thick
slices
of
bacon
and
dry
bread
the
wilkins
tent
was
near
ours
and
i
said
to
them
rather
peevishly
is
this
dust
something
awful
miss
wilkins
looked
up
with
her
sweet
smile
and
gentle
manner
and
replied
why
yes
summerhayes
it
is
pretty
bad
but
you
must
not
worry
about
such
a
little
thing
as
dust
how
can
i
help
it
i
said
my
hair
my
clothes
everything
full
of
it
and
no
chance
for
a
bath
or
a
change
a
miserable
little
basin
of
water
and
i
suppose
i
was
running
on
with
all
my
grievances
but
she
stopped
me
and
said
again
soon
now
you
will
not
mind
it
at
all
ella
and
i
are
army
girls
you
know
and
we
do
not
mind
anything
there
no
use
in
fretting
about
little
things
miss
wilkins
remarks
made
a
tremendous
impression
upon
my
mind
and
i
began
to
study
her
philosophy
at
break
of
day
the
command
marched
out
their
rifles
on
their
shoulders
swaying
along
ahead
of
us
in
the
sunlight
and
the
heat
which
continued
still
to
be
almost
unendurable
the
dry
white
dust
of
this
desert
country
boiled
and
surged
up
and
around
us
in
suffocating
clouds
i
had
my
own
canteen
hung
up
in
the
ambulance
but
the
water
in
it
got
very
warm
and
i
learned
to
take
but
a
swallow
at
a
time
as
it
could
not
be
refilled
until
we
reached
the
next
spring
and
there
is
always
some
uncertainty
in
arizona
as
to
whether
the
spring
or
basin
has
gone
dry
so
water
was
precious
and
we
could
not
afford
to
waste
a
drop
at
about
noon
we
reached
a
forlorn
mud
hut
known
as
packwood
ranch
but
the
place
had
a
bar
which
was
cheerful
for
some
of
the
poor
men
as
the
two
days
marches
had
been
rather
hard
upon
them
being
so
soft
from
the
long
voyage
i
could
never
begrudge
a
soldier
a
bit
of
cheer
after
the
hard
marches
in
arizona
through
miles
of
dust
and
burning
heat
their
canteens
long
emptied
and
their
lips
parched
and
dry
i
watched
them
often
as
they
marched
along
with
their
their
haversacks
and
their
rifles
and
i
used
to
wonder
that
they
did
not
complain
about
that
time
the
greatest
luxury
in
the
entire
world
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
glass
of
fresh
sweet
milk
and
i
shall
always
remember
packwood
ranch
because
we
had
milk
to
drink
with
our
supper
and
some
delicious
quail
to
eat
ranches
in
that
part
of
arizona
meant
only
low
adobe
dwellings
occupied
by
prospectors
or
men
who
kept
the
relays
of
animals
for
stage
routes
wretched
places
they
were
never
a
tree
or
a
bush
to
give
shade
never
a
sign
of
comfort
or
home
our
tents
were
pitched
near
packwood
out
in
the
broiling
sun
they
were
like
ovens
there
was
no
shade
no
coolness
anywhere
we
would
have
gladly
slept
after
the
day
march
but
instead
we
sat
broiling
in
the
ambulances
and
waited
for
the
long
afternoon
to
wear
away
the
next
day
dragged
along
in
the
same
manner
the
command
marching
bravely
along
through
dust
and
heat
and
thirst
as
kipling
soldier
sings
with
its
best
foot
first
and
the
road
past
an
every
bloomin
exactly
like
the
last
beal
springs
did
not
differ
from
the
other
ranch
except
that
possibly
it
was
even
more
desolate
but
a
german
lived
there
who
must
have
had
some
knowledge
of
cooking
for
i
remember
that
we
bought
a
peach
pie
from
him
and
ate
it
with
a
relish
i
remember
too
that
we
gave
him
a
good
silver
dollar
for
it
the
only
other
incident
of
that
day
march
was
the
suicide
of
major
worth
pet
dog
pete
having
exhausted
his
ability
to
endure
this
beautiful
red
setter
fixed
his
eye
upon
a
distant
range
of
mountains
and
ran
without
turning
or
heeding
any
call
straight
as
the
crow
flies
towards
them
and
death
we
never
saw
him
again
a
ranchman
told
us
he
had
known
of
several
other
instances
where
a
dog
had
given
up
in
this
manner
and
attempted
to
run
for
the
hills
we
had
a
large
greyhound
with
us
but
he
did
not
desert
major
worth
was
much
affected
by
the
loss
of
his
dog
and
did
not
join
us
at
supper
that
night
we
kept
a
nice
fat
quail
for
him
however
and
at
about
nine
when
all
was
still
and
dark
jack
entered
the
major
tent
and
said
come
now
major
my
wife
has
sent
you
this
nice
quail
do
give
up
so
about
pete
you
know
the
major
lay
upon
his
with
his
face
turned
to
the
wall
of
his
tent
he
gave
a
deep
sigh
rolled
himself
over
and
said
well
put
it
on
the
table
and
light
the
candle
i
try
to
eat
it
thank
your
wife
for
me
so
the
lieutenant
made
a
light
and
lo
and
behold
the
plate
was
there
but
the
quail
was
gone
in
the
darkness
our
great
kangaroo
hound
had
stolen
noiselessly
upon
his
master
heels
and
quietly
removed
the
bird
the
two
officers
were
dumbfounded
major
worth
said
d
n
my
luck
and
turned
his
face
again
to
the
wall
of
his
tent
now
major
worth
was
just
the
dearest
and
gentlest
sort
of
a
man
but
he
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
the
old
army
and
everyone
knows
that
times
and
customs
were
different
then
men
drank
more
and
swore
a
good
deal
and
while
i
do
not
wish
my
story
to
seem
profane
yet
i
would
not
describe
army
life
or
the
officers
as
i
knew
them
if
i
did
not
allow
the
latter
to
use
an
occasional
strong
expression
the
incident
however
served
to
cheer
up
the
major
though
he
continued
to
deplore
the
loss
of
his
beautiful
dog
for
the
next
two
days
our
route
lay
over
the
dreariest
and
most
desolate
country
it
was
not
only
dreary
it
was
positively
hostile
in
its
attitude
towards
every
living
thing
except
snakes
centipedes
and
spiders
they
seemed
to
flourish
in
those
surroundings
sometimes
either
major
worth
or
jack
would
come
and
drive
along
a
few
miles
in
the
ambulance
with
me
to
cheer
me
up
and
they
allowed
me
to
abuse
the
country
to
my
heart
content
it
seemed
to
do
me
much
good
the
desert
was
new
to
me
then
i
had
not
read
pierre
loti
wonderful
book
le
desert
and
i
did
not
see
much
to
admire
in
the
desolate
waste
lands
through
which
we
were
travelling
i
did
not
dream
of
the
power
of
the
desert
nor
that
i
should
ever
long
to
see
it
again
but
as
i
write
the
longing
possesses
me
and
the
pictures
then
indelibly
printed
upon
my
mind
long
forgotten
amidst
the
scenes
and
events
of
half
a
lifetime
unfold
themselves
like
a
panorama
before
my
vision
and
call
me
to
come
back
to
look
upon
them
once
more
chapter
viii
learning
how
to
soldier
the
grasses
failed
and
then
a
mass
of
dry
red
cactus
ruled
the
land
the
sun
rose
right
above
and
fell
as
falling
molten
from
the
skies
and
no
winged
thing
was
seen
to
pass
joaquin
miller
we
made
fourteen
miles
the
next
day
and
went
into
camp
at
a
place
called
near
some
old
silver
mines
a
bare
and
lonesome
spot
where
there
was
only
sand
to
be
seen
and
some
black
rocks
from
under
these
rocks
crept
great
tarantulas
not
forgetting
lizards
snakes
and
not
forgetting
the
scorpion
which
ran
along
with
its
tail
turned
up
ready
to
sting
anything
that
came
in
its
way
the
place
furnished
good
water
however
and
that
was
now
the
most
important
thing
the
next
day
march
was
a
long
one
the
guides
said
miles
to
willow
grove
springs
the
command
halted
ten
minutes
every
hour
for
rest
but
the
sun
poured
down
upon
us
and
i
was
glad
to
stay
in
the
ambulance
it
was
at
these
times
that
my
thoughts
turned
back
to
the
east
and
to
the
blue
sea
and
the
green
fields
of
god
country
i
looked
out
at
the
men
who
were
getting
pretty
well
fagged
and
at
the
young
officers
whose
uniforms
were
white
with
dust
and
frau
weste
words
about
glaenzendes
elend
came
to
my
mind
i
fell
to
thinking
was
the
army
life
then
only
glittering
misery
and
had
i
come
to
participate
in
it
some
of
the
old
soldiers
had
given
out
and
had
to
be
put
on
the
army
wagons
i
was
getting
to
look
rather
fagged
and
seedy
and
was
much
annoyed
at
my
appearance
not
being
acquainted
with
the
vicissitudes
of
the
desert
i
had
not
brought
in
my
a
sufficient
number
of
thin
washbodices
the
few
i
had
soon
became
black
beyond
recognition
as
the
dust
boiled
literally
up
and
into
the
ambulance
and
covered
me
from
head
to
foot
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
no
one
was
much
better
off
it
was
about
that
time
that
we
began
to
see
the
outlines
of
a
great
mountain
away
to
the
left
and
north
of
us
it
seemed
to
grow
nearer
and
nearer
and
fascinated
our
gaze
willow
grove
springs
was
reached
at
four
and
the
small
cluster
of
willow
trees
was
most
refreshing
to
our
tired
eyes
the
next
march
was
over
a
rolling
country
we
began
to
see
grass
and
to
feel
that
at
last
we
were
out
of
the
desert
the
wonderful
mountain
still
loomed
up
large
and
clear
on
our
left
i
thought
of
the
old
spanish
explorers
and
wondered
if
they
came
so
far
as
this
when
they
journeyed
through
that
part
of
our
country
three
hundred
years
before
i
wondered
what
beautiful
and
name
they
might
have
given
it
i
wondered
a
good
deal
about
that
bare
and
isolated
mountain
rising
out
of
what
seemed
an
endless
waste
of
sand
i
asked
the
driver
if
he
knew
the
name
of
it
that
is
bill
williams
mountain
he
replied
and
relapsed
into
his
customary
silence
which
was
unbroken
except
by
an
occasional
remark
to
the
wheelers
or
the
leaders
i
thought
of
the
harz
mountains
which
i
had
so
recently
tramped
over
and
the
romantic
names
and
legends
connected
with
them
and
i
sighed
to
think
such
an
imposing
landmark
as
this
should
have
such
a
prosaic
name
i
realized
that
arizona
was
not
a
land
of
romance
and
when
jack
came
to
the
ambulance
i
said
do
you
think
it
a
pity
that
such
monstrous
things
are
allowed
in
america
as
to
call
that
great
fine
mountain
williams
mountain
why
no
he
said
i
suppose
he
discovered
it
and
i
dare
say
he
had
a
hard
enough
time
before
he
got
to
it
we
camped
at
fort
rock
and
lieutenant
bailey
shot
an
antelope
it
was
the
first
game
we
had
seen
our
spirits
revived
a
bit
the
sight
of
green
grass
and
trees
brought
new
life
to
us
anvil
rock
and
old
camp
hualapais
were
our
next
two
stopping
places
we
drove
through
groves
of
oaks
cedars
and
pines
and
the
days
began
hopefully
and
ended
pleasantly
to
be
sure
the
roads
were
very
rough
and
our
bones
ached
after
a
long
day
travelling
but
our
tents
were
now
pitched
under
tall
pine
trees
and
looked
inviting
soldiers
have
a
knack
of
making
a
tent
attractive
madame
the
lieutenant
compliments
and
your
tent
is
ready
i
then
alighted
and
found
my
little
home
awaiting
me
the
tied
open
the
mattresses
laid
the
blankets
turned
back
the
with
upon
it
and
a
couple
of
at
the
door
of
the
tent
surely
it
is
good
to
be
in
the
army
i
then
thought
and
after
a
supper
consisting
of
soldiers
hot
biscuit
antelope
steak
broiled
over
the
coals
and
a
large
cup
of
black
coffee
i
went
to
rest
listening
to
the
soughing
of
the
pines
my
mattress
was
spread
always
upon
the
ground
with
a
buffalo
robe
under
it
and
a
hair
lariat
around
it
to
keep
off
the
snakes
as
it
is
said
they
do
not
like
to
cross
them
i
found
the
ground
more
comfortable
than
the
camp
cots
which
were
used
by
some
of
the
officers
and
most
of
the
women
the
only
indians
we
had
seen
up
to
that
time
were
the
peaceful
tribes
of
the
yumas
cocopahs
and
mojaves
who
lived
along
the
colorado
we
had
not
yet
entered
the
land
of
the
dread
apache
the
nights
were
now
cool
enough
and
i
never
knew
sweeter
rest
than
came
to
me
in
the
midst
of
those
pine
groves
our
road
was
gradually
turning
southward
but
for
some
days
bill
williams
was
the
predominating
feature
of
the
landscape
turn
whichever
way
we
might
still
this
purple
mountain
was
before
us
it
seemed
to
pervade
the
entire
country
and
took
on
such
wonderful
pink
colors
at
sunset
bill
williams
held
me
in
thrall
until
the
hills
and
valleys
in
the
vicinity
of
fort
whipple
shut
him
out
from
my
sight
but
he
seemed
to
have
come
into
my
life
somehow
and
in
spite
of
his
name
i
loved
him
for
the
companionship
he
had
given
me
during
those
long
hot
weary
and
interminable
days
about
the
middle
of
september
we
arrived
at
american
ranch
some
ten
miles
from
fort
whipple
which
was
the
headquarters
station
colonel
wilkins
and
his
family
left
us
and
drove
on
to
their
destination
some
officers
of
the
fifth
cavalry
rode
out
to
greet
us
and
lieutenant
earl
thomas
asked
me
to
come
into
the
post
and
rest
a
day
or
two
at
their
house
as
we
then
had
learned
that
k
company
was
to
march
on
to
camp
apache
in
the
far
eastern
part
of
the
territory
we
were
now
enabled
to
get
some
fresh
clothing
from
our
trunks
which
were
in
the
depths
of
the
and
all
the
officers
wives
were
glad
to
go
into
the
post
where
we
were
most
kindly
entertained
fort
whipple
was
a
very
gay
and
hospitable
post
near
the
town
of
prescott
which
was
the
capital
city
of
arizona
the
country
being
mountainous
and
fertile
the
place
was
very
attractive
and
i
felt
sorry
that
we
were
not
to
remain
there
but
i
soon
learned
that
in
the
army
regrets
were
vain
i
soon
ceased
to
ask
myself
whether
i
was
sorry
or
glad
at
any
change
in
our
stations
on
the
next
day
the
troops
marched
in
and
camped
outside
the
post
the
married
officers
were
able
to
join
their
wives
and
the
three
days
we
spent
there
were
delightful
there
was
a
dance
given
several
informal
dinners
drives
into
the
town
of
prescott
and
festivities
of
various
kinds
general
crook
commanded
the
department
of
arizona
then
he
was
out
on
some
expedition
but
crook
gave
a
pleasant
dinner
for
us
after
dinner
crook
came
and
sat
beside
me
asked
kindly
about
our
long
journey
and
added
i
am
truly
sorry
the
general
is
away
i
should
like
for
him
to
meet
you
you
are
just
the
sort
of
woman
he
likes
a
few
years
afterwards
i
met
the
general
and
remembering
this
remark
i
was
conscious
of
making
a
special
effort
to
please
the
indifferent
courtesy
with
which
he
treated
me
however
led
me
to
think
that
women
are
often
mistaken
judges
of
their
husband
tastes
the
officers
quarters
at
fort
whipple
were
quite
commodious
and
after
seven
weeks
continuous
travelling
the
comforts
which
surrounded
me
at
thomas
home
seemed
like
the
veriest
luxuries
i
was
much
affected
by
the
kindness
shown
me
by
people
i
had
never
met
before
and
i
kept
wondering
if
i
should
ever
have
an
opportunity
to
return
their
courtesies
do
worry
about
that
martha
said
jack
your
turn
will
come
he
proved
a
true
prophet
for
sooner
or
later
i
saw
them
all
again
and
was
able
to
extend
to
them
the
hospitality
of
an
army
home
nevertheless
my
heart
grows
warm
whenever
i
think
of
the
people
who
first
welcomed
me
to
arizona
me
a
stranger
in
the
army
and
in
the
great
southwest
as
well
at
fort
whipple
we
met
also
some
people
we
had
known
at
fort
russell
who
had
gone
down
with
the
first
detachment
among
them
major
and
wilhelm
who
were
to
remain
at
headquarters
we
bade
to
the
colonel
and
his
family
to
the
officers
of
f
who
were
to
stay
behind
and
to
our
kind
friends
of
the
fifth
cavalry
we
now
made
a
fresh
start
with
captain
ogilby
in
command
two
days
took
us
into
camp
verde
which
lies
on
a
mesa
above
the
river
from
which
it
takes
its
name
captain
brayton
of
the
eight
infantry
and
his
wife
who
were
already
settled
at
camp
verde
received
us
and
took
the
best
care
of
us
brayton
gave
me
a
few
more
lessons
in
army
and
i
could
not
have
had
a
better
teacher
i
told
her
about
jack
and
the
tinware
her
bright
eyes
snapped
and
she
said
men
think
they
know
everything
but
the
truth
is
they
do
know
anything
you
go
right
ahead
and
have
all
the
tinware
and
other
things
all
you
can
get
in
fact
and
when
the
time
comes
to
move
send
jack
out
of
the
house
get
a
soldier
to
come
in
and
pack
you
up
and
say
nothing
about
it
but
the
weight
fiddlesticks
they
all
say
that
now
you
just
not
mind
their
talk
but
take
all
you
need
and
it
will
get
carried
along
somehow
still
another
company
left
our
ranks
and
remained
at
camp
verde
the
command
was
now
getting
deplorably
small
i
thought
to
enter
an
indian
country
for
we
were
now
to
start
for
camp
apache
several
routes
were
discussed
but
it
being
quite
early
in
the
autumn
and
the
apache
indians
being
just
then
comparatively
quiet
they
decided
to
march
the
troops
over
crook
trail
which
crossed
the
mogollon
range
and
was
considered
to
be
shorter
than
any
other
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
i
had
never
seen
a
map
of
arizona
and
never
heard
of
crook
trail
maps
never
interested
me
and
i
had
not
read
much
about
life
in
the
territories
at
that
time
the
history
of
our
savage
races
was
a
blank
page
to
me
i
had
been
listening
to
the
stories
of
an
old
civilization
and
my
mind
did
not
adjust
itself
readily
to
the
new
surroundings
chapter
ix
across
the
mogollons
it
was
a
fine
afternoon
in
the
latter
part
of
september
when
our
small
detachment
with
captain
ogilby
in
command
marched
out
of
camp
verde
there
were
two
companies
of
soldiers
numbering
about
a
hundred
men
in
all
five
or
six
officers
bailey
and
myself
and
a
couple
of
laundresses
i
can
not
say
that
we
were
gay
bailey
had
said
to
her
father
and
mother
and
sister
at
fort
whipple
and
although
she
was
an
army
girl
she
did
not
seem
to
bear
the
parting
very
philosophically
her
young
child
nine
months
old
was
with
her
and
her
husband
as
stalwart
and
handsome
an
officer
as
ever
wore
but
we
were
facing
unknown
dangers
in
a
far
country
away
from
mother
father
sister
and
brother
a
country
infested
with
roving
bands
of
the
most
cruel
tribe
ever
known
who
tortured
before
they
killed
we
could
not
even
pretend
to
be
gay
the
travelling
was
very
difficult
and
rough
and
both
men
and
animals
were
worn
out
by
night
but
we
were
now
in
the
mountains
the
air
was
cool
and
pleasant
and
the
nights
so
cold
that
we
were
glad
to
have
a
small
stove
in
our
tents
to
dress
by
in
the
mornings
the
scenery
was
wild
and
grand
in
fact
beyond
all
that
i
had
ever
dreamed
of
more
than
that
it
seemed
so
untrod
so
fresh
somehow
and
i
do
not
suppose
that
even
now
in
the
day
of
railroads
and
tourists
many
people
have
had
the
view
of
the
tonto
basin
which
we
had
one
day
from
the
top
of
the
mogollon
range
i
remember
thinking
as
we
alighted
from
our
ambulances
and
stood
looking
over
into
the
basin
surely
i
have
never
seen
anything
to
compare
with
this
but
oh
would
any
sane
human
being
voluntarily
go
through
with
what
i
have
endured
on
this
journey
in
order
to
look
upon
this
wonderful
scene
the
roads
had
now
become
so
difficult
that
our
could
not
move
as
fast
as
the
lighter
vehicles
or
the
troops
sometimes
at
a
critical
place
in
the
road
where
the
ascent
was
not
only
dangerous
but
doubtful
or
there
was
perhaps
a
sharp
turn
the
ambulances
waited
to
see
the
wagons
safely
over
the
pass
each
wagon
had
its
six
mules
each
ambulance
had
also
its
quota
of
six
at
the
foot
of
one
of
these
steep
places
the
wagons
would
halt
the
teamsters
would
inspect
the
road
and
calculate
the
possibilities
of
reaching
the
top
then
furiously
cracking
their
whips
and
pouring
forth
volley
upon
volley
of
oaths
they
would
start
the
team
each
mule
got
its
share
of
dreadful
curses
i
had
never
heard
or
conceived
of
any
oaths
like
those
they
made
my
blood
fairly
curdle
and
i
am
not
speaking
figuratively
the
shivers
ran
up
and
down
my
back
and
i
half
expected
to
see
those
teamsters
struck
down
by
the
hand
of
the
almighty
for
although
the
anathemas
hurled
at
my
innocent
head
during
the
impressionable
years
of
girlhood
by
the
pale
and
determined
congregational
ministers
with
spectacles
who
held
forth
in
the
of
my
maternal
ancestry
all
honor
to
their
sincerity
had
taken
little
hold
upon
my
mind
still
the
vital
drop
of
the
puritan
was
in
my
blood
and
the
fear
of
a
personal
god
and
his
wrath
still
existed
away
back
in
the
hidden
recesses
of
my
heart
this
swearing
and
lashing
went
on
until
the
swaying
swinging
and
swerving
to
the
edge
of
the
cut
and
back
again
to
the
perpendicular
wall
of
the
mountain
would
finally
reach
the
top
and
pass
on
around
the
bend
then
another
would
do
the
same
each
teamster
had
his
own
particular
variety
of
oaths
each
mule
had
a
feminine
name
and
this
brought
the
swearing
down
to
a
sort
of
personal
basis
i
remonstrated
with
jack
but
he
said
teamsters
always
swore
the
mules
would
even
stir
to
go
up
a
hill
if
they
were
sworn
at
like
that
by
the
time
we
had
crossed
the
great
mogollon
mesa
i
had
become
accustomed
to
those
dreadful
oaths
and
learned
to
admire
the
skill
persistency
and
endurance
shown
by
those
rough
teamsters
i
actually
got
so
far
as
to
believe
what
jack
had
told
me
about
the
swearing
being
necessary
for
i
saw
impossible
feats
performed
by
the
combination
when
near
camp
and
over
the
difficult
places
we
drove
on
ahead
and
waited
for
the
wagons
to
come
in
it
was
sometimes
late
evening
before
tents
could
be
pitched
and
supper
cooked
and
oh
to
see
the
poor
jaded
animals
when
the
wagons
reached
camp
i
could
forget
my
own
discomfort
and
even
hunger
when
i
looked
at
their
sad
faces
one
night
the
teamsters
reported
that
a
team
had
rolled
down
the
steep
side
of
a
mountain
i
did
not
ask
what
became
of
the
poor
faithful
mules
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
in
my
pity
and
real
distress
over
the
fate
of
these
patient
brutes
i
forgot
to
inquire
what
boxes
were
on
the
unfortunate
wagon
we
began
to
have
some
shooting
lieutenant
bailey
shot
a
young
deer
and
some
wild
turkeys
and
we
could
not
complain
any
more
of
the
lack
of
fresh
food
it
did
not
surprise
us
to
learn
that
ours
was
the
first
to
pass
over
crook
trail
for
miles
and
miles
the
road
was
nothing
but
a
clearing
and
we
were
pitched
and
jerked
from
side
to
side
of
the
ambulance
as
we
struck
large
rocks
or
in
some
steep
places
logs
were
chained
to
the
rear
of
the
ambulance
to
keep
it
from
pitching
forward
onto
the
backs
of
the
mules
at
such
places
i
got
out
and
picked
my
way
down
the
rocky
declivity
we
now
began
to
hear
of
the
apache
indians
who
were
always
out
in
either
large
or
small
bands
doing
their
murderous
work
one
day
a
party
of
horseman
tore
past
us
at
a
gallop
some
of
them
raised
their
hats
to
us
as
they
rushed
past
and
our
officers
recognized
general
crook
but
we
could
not
in
the
cloud
of
dust
distinguish
officers
from
scouts
all
wore
the
flannel
shirt
handkerchief
tied
about
the
neck
and
broad
campaign
hat
after
supper
that
evening
the
conversation
turned
upon
indians
in
general
and
apaches
in
particular
we
camped
always
at
a
basin
or
a
tank
or
a
hole
or
a
spring
or
in
some
canon
by
a
creek
always
from
water
to
water
we
marched
our
camp
that
night
was
in
the
midst
of
a
primeval
grove
of
tall
pine
trees
verily
an
untrodden
land
we
had
a
big
and
sat
around
it
until
very
late
there
were
only
five
or
six
officers
and
bailey
and
myself
the
darkness
and
blackness
of
the
place
were
uncanny
we
all
sat
looking
into
the
fire
somebody
said
injuns
would
not
have
such
a
big
fire
as
that
no
you
bet
they
would
was
the
quick
reply
of
one
of
the
officers
then
followed
a
long
pause
we
all
sat
thinking
and
gazing
into
the
fire
which
crackled
and
leaped
into
fitful
blazes
our
figures
must
make
a
mighty
good
outline
against
that
fire
remarked
one
of
officers
nonchalantly
i
dare
say
those
stealthy
sons
of
satan
know
exactly
where
we
are
at
this
minute
he
added
yes
you
bet
your
life
they
do
answered
one
of
the
younger
men
lapsing
into
the
frontiersman
language
from
the
force
of
his
convictions
look
behind
you
at
those
trees
jack
said
major
worth
can
you
see
anything
no
and
if
there
were
an
apache
behind
each
one
of
them
we
should
never
know
it
we
all
turned
and
peered
into
the
black
darkness
which
surrounded
us
another
pause
followed
the
silence
was
weird
only
the
cracking
of
the
fire
was
heard
and
the
mournful
soughing
of
the
wind
in
the
pines
suddenly
a
crash
we
started
to
our
feet
and
faced
around
a
dead
branch
said
some
one
major
worth
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
turning
to
jack
said
in
a
low
tone
d
d
if
i
do
believe
i
getting
nervous
and
saying
good
night
he
walked
towards
his
tent
no
element
of
doubt
pervaded
my
mind
as
to
my
own
state
the
weird
feeling
of
being
up
in
those
remote
mountain
passes
with
but
a
handful
of
soldiers
against
the
wary
apaches
the
mysterious
look
of
those
black
upon
which
flickered
the
uncertain
light
of
the
now
dying
and
from
behind
each
one
of
which
i
imagined
a
red
devil
might
be
at
that
moment
taking
aim
with
his
deadly
arrow
all
inspired
me
with
fear
such
as
i
had
never
before
known
in
the
cyclone
which
had
overtaken
our
good
ship
in
where
we
lay
tossing
about
at
the
mercy
of
the
waves
for
long
hours
i
had
expected
to
yield
my
body
to
the
dark
and
grewsome
depths
of
the
ocean
i
had
almost
felt
the
cold
arms
of
death
about
me
but
compared
to
the
sickening
dread
of
the
cruel
apache
my
fears
then
had
been
as
naught
facing
the
inevitable
at
sea
i
had
closed
my
eyes
and
said
to
life
but
in
this
mysterious
darkness
every
nerve
every
sense
was
keenly
alive
with
terror
several
of
that
small
party
around
the
have
gone
from
amongst
us
but
i
venture
to
say
that
of
the
few
who
are
left
not
one
will
deny
that
he
shared
in
the
vague
apprehension
which
seized
upon
us
midnight
found
us
still
lingering
around
the
dead
ashes
of
the
fire
after
going
to
our
tent
jack
saw
that
i
was
frightened
he
said
worry
martha
an
apache
never
was
known
to
attack
in
the
night
and
after
hearing
many
repetitions
of
this
assertion
upon
which
i
made
him
take
his
oath
i
threw
myself
upon
the
bed
after
our
candle
was
out
i
said
when
do
they
attack
jack
who
with
the
soldiers
indifference
to
danger
was
already
half
asleep
replied
just
before
daylight
usually
but
do
not
worry
i
say
there
are
any
injuns
in
this
neighborhood
why
did
you
meet
general
crook
you
ought
to
have
some
sense
if
there
been
an
injun
around
here
he
would
have
cleaned
him
out
now
go
to
sleep
and
do
be
foolish
but
i
was
taking
my
first
lessons
in
campaigning
and
sleep
was
not
so
easy
just
before
dawn
as
i
had
fallen
into
a
light
slumber
the
flaps
of
the
tent
burst
open
and
began
shaking
violently
to
and
fro
i
sprang
to
my
feet
prepared
for
the
worst
jack
started
up
what
is
it
he
cried
it
must
have
been
the
wind
i
think
but
it
frightened
me
i
murmured
the
lieutenant
fastened
the
together
and
lay
down
to
sleep
again
but
my
heart
beat
fast
and
i
listened
for
every
sound
the
day
gradually
dawned
and
with
it
my
fears
of
the
night
were
allayed
but
ever
after
that
jack
fatal
answer
just
before
daylight
kept
my
eyes
wide
open
for
hours
before
the
dawn
chapter
x
a
perilous
adventure
one
fine
afternoon
after
a
march
of
miles
over
a
rocky
road
and
finding
our
provisions
low
bailey
and
jack
went
out
to
shoot
wild
turkeys
as
they
shouldered
their
guns
and
walked
away
captain
ogilby
called
out
to
them
do
not
go
too
far
from
camp
jack
returned
at
sundown
with
a
pair
of
fine
turkeys
but
bailey
failed
to
come
in
however
as
they
all
knew
him
to
be
an
experienced
woodsman
no
one
showed
much
anxiety
until
darkness
had
settled
over
the
camp
then
they
began
to
signal
by
discharging
their
rifles
the
officers
went
out
in
various
directions
giving
halloos
and
firing
at
intervals
but
there
came
no
sound
of
the
missing
man
the
camp
was
now
thoroughly
alarmed
this
was
too
dangerous
a
place
for
a
man
to
be
wandering
around
in
all
night
and
of
soldiers
were
formed
trees
were
burned
and
the
din
of
rifles
constantly
discharged
added
to
the
excitement
one
party
after
another
came
in
they
had
scoured
the
country
and
not
a
trace
of
bailey
the
young
wife
sat
in
her
tent
soothing
her
little
child
everybody
except
her
gave
up
hope
the
time
dragged
on
our
hearts
grew
heavy
the
sky
was
alight
with
blazing
trees
i
went
into
bailey
tent
she
was
calm
and
altogether
lovely
and
said
charley
ca
get
lost
and
unless
something
has
happened
to
him
he
will
come
in
ella
bailey
was
a
brave
young
army
woman
she
was
an
inspiration
to
the
entire
camp
finally
after
hours
of
the
keenest
anxiety
a
noise
of
gladsome
shouts
rang
through
the
trees
and
in
came
a
party
of
men
with
the
young
officer
on
their
shoulders
his
friend
craig
had
been
untiring
in
the
search
and
at
last
had
heard
a
faint
halloo
in
the
distance
and
one
shot
the
only
cartridge
poor
bailey
had
left
after
going
over
almost
impassable
places
they
finally
found
him
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
in
the
black
darkness
of
the
evening
he
had
walked
directly
over
the
edge
of
the
chasm
and
fallen
to
the
bottom
dislocating
his
ankle
he
was
some
miles
from
camp
and
had
used
up
all
his
ammunition
except
the
one
cartridge
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
walk
or
even
crawl
out
of
the
ravine
but
had
finally
been
overcome
by
exhaustion
and
lay
there
helpless
in
the
wild
vastnesses
of
the
mountains
a
desperate
situation
indeed
some
time
afterwards
he
told
me
how
he
felt
when
he
realized
how
poor
his
chances
were
when
he
saw
he
had
only
one
cartridge
left
and
found
that
he
had
scarce
strength
to
answer
a
halloo
should
he
hear
one
but
soldiers
never
like
to
talk
much
about
such
things
chapter
xi
camp
apache
by
the
fourth
of
october
we
had
crossed
the
range
and
began
to
see
something
which
looked
like
roads
our
animals
were
fagged
to
a
state
of
exhaustion
but
the
travelling
was
now
much
easier
and
there
was
good
grazing
and
after
three
more
long
day
marches
we
arrived
at
camp
apache
we
were
now
at
our
journey
end
after
two
months
continuous
travelling
and
i
felt
reasonably
sure
of
shelter
and
a
fireside
for
the
winter
at
least
i
knew
that
my
husband
promotion
was
expected
but
the
immediate
present
was
filled
with
an
interest
so
absorbing
that
a
consideration
of
the
future
was
out
of
the
question
at
that
time
it
was
the
year
of
the
officers
quarters
at
camp
apache
were
log
cabins
built
near
the
edge
of
the
deep
canon
through
which
the
white
mountain
river
flows
before
its
junction
with
black
river
we
were
welcomed
by
the
officers
of
the
fifth
cavalry
who
were
stationed
there
it
was
altogether
picturesque
and
attractive
in
addition
to
the
row
of
log
cabins
there
were
enormous
stables
and
government
buildings
and
a
cutler
store
we
were
entertained
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
quarters
were
assigned
to
us
the
second
lieutenants
had
rather
a
poor
choice
as
the
quarters
were
scarce
we
were
assigned
a
half
of
a
log
cabin
which
gave
us
one
room
a
small
square
hall
and
a
bare
shed
the
latter
detached
from
the
house
to
be
used
for
a
kitchen
the
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
was
occupied
by
the
post
surgeon
who
was
temporarily
absent
our
things
were
unloaded
and
brought
to
this
cabin
i
missed
the
barrel
of
china
and
learned
that
it
had
been
on
the
unfortunate
wagon
which
rolled
down
the
i
had
not
attained
that
state
of
mind
which
came
to
me
later
in
my
army
life
i
cared
then
a
good
deal
about
my
belongings
and
the
annoyance
caused
by
the
loss
of
our
china
was
quite
considerable
i
knew
there
was
none
to
be
obtained
at
camp
apache
as
most
of
the
merchandise
came
in
by
to
that
isolated
place
mrs
dodge
of
the
infantry
who
was
about
to
leave
the
post
heard
of
my
predicament
and
offered
me
some
china
plates
and
cups
which
she
thought
not
worth
the
trouble
of
packing
so
she
said
and
i
was
glad
to
accept
them
and
thanked
her
almost
with
tears
in
my
eyes
bowen
nailed
down
our
one
carpet
over
the
poor
board
floor
after
having
first
sprinkled
down
a
thick
layer
of
clean
straw
which
he
brought
from
the
quartermaster
stables
two
iron
cots
from
the
hospital
were
brought
over
and
two
filled
with
fresh
sweet
straw
were
laid
upon
them
over
these
were
laid
our
mattresses
springs
were
then
unheard
of
in
that
country
we
untied
our
folding
chairs
built
a
fire
on
the
hearth
captured
an
old
and
a
round
table
from
somewhere
and
that
was
our
a
pine
table
was
found
for
the
small
hall
which
was
to
be
our
and
some
chairs
with
seats
were
brought
from
the
barracks
some
shelves
knocked
up
against
one
wall
to
serve
as
sideboard
now
for
the
kitchen
a
and
various
things
were
sent
over
from
the
and
bowen
the
wonder
of
it
drove
in
nails
and
hung
up
my
fort
russell
and
put
up
shelves
and
stood
my
pans
in
rows
and
polished
the
stove
and
went
out
and
stole
a
table
somewhere
bowen
was
invaluable
in
that
way
polished
the
zinc
under
the
stove
and
lo
and
behold
my
army
kitchen
bowen
was
indeed
a
treasure
he
said
he
would
like
to
cook
for
us
for
ten
dollars
a
month
we
readily
accepted
this
offer
there
were
no
persons
to
be
obtained
in
these
distant
places
who
could
do
the
cooking
in
the
families
of
officers
so
it
was
customary
to
employ
a
soldier
and
the
soldier
often
displayed
remarkable
ability
in
the
way
of
cooking
in
some
cases
in
fact
more
than
in
the
way
of
soldiering
they
liked
the
little
addition
to
their
pay
if
they
were
of
frugal
mind
they
had
also
their
own
quiet
room
to
sleep
in
and
i
often
thought
the
family
life
offering
as
it
did
a
contrast
to
the
bareness
and
desolation
of
the
noisy
barracks
appealed
to
the
domestic
instinct
so
strong
in
some
men
natures
at
all
events
it
was
always
easy
in
those
days
to
get
a
man
from
the
company
and
they
sometimes
remained
for
years
with
an
officer
family
in
some
cases
attending
drills
and
besides
now
came
the
unpacking
of
the
chests
and
trunks
in
our
one
diminutive
room
and
small
hall
was
no
closet
there
were
no
hooks
on
the
bare
walls
no
place
to
hang
things
or
lay
things
and
what
to
do
i
did
not
know
i
was
in
despair
jack
came
in
to
find
me
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
chest
which
was
half
unpacked
the
contents
on
the
floor
i
was
very
mournful
and
he
did
not
see
why
oh
jack
i
nowhere
to
put
things
what
things
said
this
impossible
man
why
all
our
things
said
i
losing
my
temper
ca
you
see
them
put
them
back
in
the
chests
and
get
them
out
as
you
need
them
said
this
son
of
mars
and
buckled
on
his
sword
do
the
best
you
can
martha
i
have
to
go
to
the
barracks
be
back
again
soon
i
looked
around
me
and
tried
to
solve
the
problem
there
was
no
bureau
nothing
not
a
nook
or
corner
where
a
thing
might
be
stowed
i
gazed
at
the
motley
collection
of
silver
bottles
boot
jacks
saddles
old
uniforms
full
dress
military
hats
cut
glass
lamps
and
books
and
i
gave
it
up
in
despair
you
see
i
was
not
an
army
girl
and
i
did
not
know
how
to
manage
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
however
but
to
follow
jack
advice
so
i
threw
the
boots
saddles
and
equipments
under
the
bed
and
laid
the
other
things
back
in
the
chests
closed
the
lids
and
went
out
to
take
a
look
at
the
post
towards
evening
a
soldier
came
for
orders
for
beef
and
i
learned
how
to
manage
that
i
was
told
that
we
bought
our
meats
direct
from
the
contractor
i
had
to
state
how
much
and
what
cuts
i
wished
another
soldier
came
to
bring
us
milk
and
i
asked
jack
who
was
the
milkman
and
he
said
blessed
if
he
knew
i
learned
afterwards
that
the
soldiers
roped
some
of
the
wild
texas
cows
that
were
kept
in
one
of
the
government
corrals
and
tied
them
securely
to
keep
them
from
kicking
then
milked
them
and
the
milk
was
divided
up
among
the
officers
families
according
to
rank
we
received
about
a
pint
every
night
i
declared
it
was
not
enough
but
i
soon
discovered
that
however
much
education
position
and
money
might
count
in
civil
life
rank
seemed
to
be
the
one
and
only
thing
in
the
army
and
jack
had
not
much
of
that
just
then
the
question
of
getting
settled
comfortably
still
worried
me
and
after
a
day
of
two
i
went
over
to
see
what
bailey
had
done
to
my
surprise
i
found
her
out
playing
tennis
her
little
boy
asleep
in
the
which
they
had
brought
all
the
way
from
san
francisco
near
the
court
i
joined
the
group
and
afterwards
asked
her
advice
about
the
matter
she
laughed
kindly
and
said
oh
you
get
used
to
it
and
things
will
settle
themselves
of
course
it
is
troublesome
but
you
can
have
shelves
and
such
things
you
soon
learn
and
still
smiling
she
gave
her
ball
a
neat
i
concluded
that
my
new
england
bringing
up
had
been
too
serious
and
wondered
if
i
had
made
a
dreadful
mistake
in
marrying
into
the
army
or
at
least
in
following
my
husband
to
arizona
i
debated
the
question
with
myself
from
all
sides
and
decided
then
and
there
that
young
army
wives
should
stay
at
home
with
their
mothers
and
fathers
and
not
go
into
such
wild
and
uncouth
places
i
thought
my
decision
irrevocable
before
the
two
small
deep
windows
in
our
room
we
hung
some
turkey
red
cotton
jack
built
in
his
spare
moments
a
couch
for
me
and
gradually
our
small
quarters
assumed
an
appearance
of
comfort
i
turned
my
attention
a
little
to
social
matters
we
dined
at
captain
the
commanding
officer
house
his
wife
was
a
famous
washington
beauty
he
had
more
rank
consequently
more
rooms
than
we
had
and
their
quarters
were
very
comfortable
and
attractive
there
was
much
that
was
new
and
interesting
at
the
post
the
indians
who
lived
on
this
reservation
were
the
white
mountain
apaches
a
fierce
and
cruel
tribe
whose
depredations
and
atrocities
had
been
carried
on
for
years
in
and
around
and
indeed
far
away
from
their
mountain
homes
but
this
tribe
was
now
under
surveillance
of
the
government
and
guarded
by
a
strong
garrison
of
cavalry
and
infantry
at
camp
apache
they
were
divided
into
bands
under
chiefs
pedro
diablo
patone
and
cibiano
they
came
into
the
post
twice
a
week
to
be
counted
and
to
receive
their
rations
of
beef
sugar
beans
and
other
staples
which
uncle
commissary
officer
issued
to
them
in
the
absence
of
other
amusement
the
officers
wives
walked
over
to
witness
this
rather
solemn
ceremony
at
least
the
serious
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
indians
as
they
received
their
rations
gave
an
air
of
solemnity
to
the
proceeding
large
stakes
were
driven
into
the
ground
at
each
stake
sat
or
stood
the
leader
of
a
band
a
sort
of
father
to
his
people
then
the
rest
of
them
stretched
out
in
several
long
lines
young
bucks
and
old
ones
squaws
and
pappooses
the
families
together
about
seventeen
hundred
souls
in
all
i
used
to
walk
up
and
down
between
the
lines
with
the
other
women
and
the
squaws
looked
at
our
clothes
and
chuckled
and
made
some
of
their
inarticulate
remarks
to
each
other
the
bucks
looked
admiringly
at
the
white
women
especially
at
the
cavalry
beauty
montgomery
although
i
thought
that
chief
diablo
cast
a
special
eye
at
our
young
bailey
of
the
infantry
diablo
was
a
handsome
fellow
i
was
especially
impressed
by
his
extraordinary
good
looks
this
tribe
was
quiet
at
that
time
only
a
few
renegades
escaping
into
the
hills
on
their
wild
adventures
but
i
never
felt
any
confidence
in
them
and
was
on
the
whole
rather
afraid
of
them
the
squaws
were
shy
and
seldom
came
near
the
officers
quarters
some
of
the
younger
girls
were
extremely
pretty
they
had
delicate
hands
and
small
feet
encased
in
moccasins
they
wore
short
skirts
made
of
stripped
bark
which
hung
gracefully
about
their
bare
knees
and
supple
limbs
and
usually
a
sort
of
camisa
made
neatly
of
coarse
unbleached
muslin
with
a
band
around
the
neck
and
arms
and
in
cold
weather
a
pretty
blanket
was
wrapped
around
their
shoulders
and
fastened
at
the
breast
in
front
in
summer
the
blanket
was
replaced
by
a
square
of
bright
calico
their
coarse
black
hair
hung
in
long
braids
in
front
over
each
shoulder
and
nearly
all
of
them
wore
an
even
bang
or
fringe
over
the
forehead
of
course
hats
were
unheard
of
the
apaches
both
men
and
women
had
not
then
departed
from
the
customs
of
their
ancestors
and
still
retained
the
extraordinary
beauty
and
picturesqueness
of
their
aboriginal
dress
they
wore
sometimes
a
fine
buckskin
upper
garment
and
if
of
high
standing
in
the
tribe
necklaces
of
elks
teeth
the
young
lieutenants
sometimes
tried
to
make
up
to
the
prettiest
ones
and
offered
them
trinkets
pretty
boxes
of
soap
beads
and
small
mirrors
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
indian
girl
but
the
young
maids
were
coy
enough
it
seemed
to
me
they
cared
more
for
men
of
their
own
race
once
or
twice
i
saw
older
squaws
with
horribly
disfigured
faces
i
supposed
it
was
the
result
of
some
ravaging
disease
but
i
learned
that
it
was
the
custom
of
this
tribe
to
cut
off
the
noses
of
those
women
who
were
unfaithful
to
their
lords
poor
creatures
they
had
my
pity
for
they
were
only
children
of
nature
after
all
living
close
to
the
earth
close
to
the
pulse
of
their
mother
but
this
sort
of
punishment
seemed
to
be
the
expression
of
the
cruel
and
revengeful
nature
of
the
apache
chapter
xii
life
amongst
the
apaches
bowen
proved
to
be
a
fairly
good
cook
and
i
ventured
to
ask
people
to
dinner
in
our
little
hall
a
veritable
box
of
a
place
one
day
feeling
particularly
ambitious
to
have
my
dinner
a
success
i
made
a
bold
attempt
at
oyster
patties
with
the
confidence
of
youth
and
inexperience
i
made
the
pastry
and
it
was
a
success
i
took
a
can
of
baltimore
oysters
and
did
them
up
in
a
fashion
that
astonished
myself
and
when
after
the
soup
each
guest
was
served
with
a
hot
oyster
patty
one
of
the
cavalry
officers
fairly
gasped
oyster
patty
if
i
alive
where
on
earth
bless
my
stars
and
this
at
camp
apache
and
by
holy
jerusalem
they
are
good
too
claimed
captain
reilly
and
turning
to
bowen
he
said
bowen
did
you
make
these
bowen
straightened
himself
up
to
his
six
foot
two
clapped
his
heels
together
and
came
to
attention
looked
straight
to
the
front
and
replied
yes
sir
i
thought
i
heard
captain
reilly
say
in
an
undertone
to
his
neighbor
the
hell
he
did
but
i
was
not
sure
at
that
season
we
got
excellent
wild
turkeys
there
and
good
southdown
mutton
and
one
could
not
complain
of
such
living
but
i
could
never
get
accustomed
to
the
wretched
small
space
of
one
room
and
a
hall
for
the
kitchen
being
detached
could
scarcely
be
counted
in
i
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
a
spacious
house
with
plenty
of
bedrooms
closets
and
an
immense
garret
the
forlorn
makeshifts
for
closets
and
the
absence
of
all
conveniences
annoyed
me
and
added
much
to
the
difficulties
of
my
situation
added
to
this
i
soon
discovered
that
my
husband
had
a
penchant
for
buying
and
collecting
things
which
seemed
utterly
worthless
to
me
and
only
added
to
the
number
of
articles
to
be
handled
and
packed
away
i
begged
him
to
refrain
and
to
remember
that
he
was
married
and
that
we
had
not
the
money
to
spend
in
such
ways
he
really
did
try
to
improve
and
denied
himself
the
taking
of
many
an
alluring
share
in
raffles
for
old
saddles
pistols
guns
and
stuff
which
were
always
being
held
at
the
sutler
store
but
an
auction
of
condemned
hospital
stores
was
too
much
for
him
and
he
came
in
triumphantly
one
day
bringing
a
box
of
antiquated
instruments
in
his
hand
good
gracious
i
cried
what
can
you
ever
do
with
those
forceps
oh
they
are
splendid
he
said
and
they
will
come
in
mighty
handy
some
time
i
saw
that
he
loved
tools
and
instruments
and
i
reflected
why
not
there
are
lots
of
things
i
have
a
passion
for
and
love
just
as
he
loves
those
things
and
i
shall
never
say
any
more
about
it
only
i
added
aloud
do
not
expect
me
to
pack
up
such
trash
when
we
come
to
move
you
will
have
to
look
out
for
it
yourself
so
with
that
spiteful
remark
from
me
the
episode
of
the
forceps
was
ended
for
the
time
at
least
as
the
winter
came
on
the
isolation
of
the
place
had
a
rather
depressing
effect
upon
us
all
the
officers
were
engaged
in
their
various
duties
drill
instruction
and
other
military
occupations
they
found
some
diversion
at
the
store
where
the
ranchmen
assembled
and
told
frontier
stories
and
played
exciting
games
of
poker
jack
duties
as
commissary
officer
kept
him
much
away
from
me
and
i
was
very
lonely
the
mail
was
brought
in
twice
a
week
by
a
soldier
on
horseback
when
he
failed
to
come
in
at
the
usual
time
much
anxiety
was
manifested
and
i
learned
that
only
a
short
time
before
one
of
the
had
been
killed
by
indians
and
the
mail
destroyed
i
did
not
wonder
that
on
everybody
came
out
in
front
of
the
quarters
and
asked
is
the
in
and
nothing
much
was
done
or
thought
of
on
that
day
until
we
saw
him
come
jogging
in
the
tied
behind
his
saddle
our
letters
were
from
two
to
three
weeks
old
the
eastern
mail
came
via
santa
fe
to
the
terminus
of
the
railroad
and
then
by
stage
for
in
the
railroads
did
not
extend
very
far
into
the
southwest
at
a
certain
point
on
the
old
new
mexico
road
our
man
met
the
san
carlos
carrier
and
received
the
mail
for
apache
i
do
not
understand
i
said
how
any
soldier
can
be
found
to
take
such
a
dangerous
detail
why
so
said
jack
they
like
it
i
should
think
that
when
they
got
into
those
canons
and
narrow
defiles
they
would
think
of
the
horrible
fate
of
their
predecessor
said
i
perhaps
they
do
he
answered
but
a
soldier
is
always
glad
to
get
a
detail
that
gives
him
a
change
from
the
routine
of
post
life
i
was
getting
to
learn
about
the
indomitable
pluck
of
our
soldiers
they
did
not
seem
to
be
afraid
of
anything
at
camp
apache
my
opinion
of
the
american
soldier
was
formed
and
it
has
never
changed
in
the
long
march
across
the
territory
they
had
cared
for
my
wants
and
performed
uncomplainingly
for
me
services
usually
rendered
by
women
those
were
before
the
days
of
lineal
promotion
officers
remained
with
their
regiments
for
many
years
a
feeling
of
regimental
prestige
held
officers
and
men
together
i
began
to
share
that
feeling
i
knew
the
names
of
the
men
in
the
company
and
not
one
but
was
ready
to
do
a
service
for
the
lieutenant
wife
k
had
long
been
a
bachelor
company
and
now
a
young
woman
had
joined
it
i
was
a
person
to
be
pampered
and
cared
for
and
they
knew
besides
that
i
was
not
long
in
the
army
during
that
winter
i
received
many
a
wild
turkey
and
other
nice
things
for
the
table
from
the
men
of
the
company
i
learned
to
know
and
to
thoroughly
respect
the
enlisted
man
of
the
american
army
and
now
into
the
varied
kaleidoscope
of
my
army
life
stepped
the
indian
agent
and
of
all
unkempt
unshorn
personages
who
had
ever
stepped
foot
into
our
quarters
this
was
the
worst
heaven
save
us
from
a
government
which
appoints
such
men
as
that
to
watch
over
and
deal
with
indians
cried
i
as
he
left
the
house
is
it
possible
that
his
position
here
demands
social
recognition
i
added
hush
said
the
second
lieutenant
of
k
company
it
the
interior
department
that
appoints
the
indian
agents
and
besides
he
added
it
not
good
taste
on
your
part
martha
to
abuse
the
government
which
gives
us
our
bread
and
butter
well
you
can
say
what
you
like
and
preach
policy
all
you
wish
no
government
on
earth
can
compel
me
to
associate
with
such
men
as
those
with
that
assertion
i
left
the
room
to
prevent
farther
argument
and
i
will
here
add
that
in
my
experience
on
the
frontier
which
extended
over
a
long
period
it
was
never
my
good
fortune
to
meet
with
an
indian
agent
who
impressed
me
as
being
the
right
sort
of
a
man
to
deal
with
those
children
of
nature
for
indians
are
like
children
and
their
intuitions
are
keen
they
know
and
appreciate
honesty
and
fair
dealing
and
they
know
a
gentleman
when
they
meet
one
the
winter
came
on
apace
but
the
weather
was
mild
and
pleasant
one
day
some
officers
came
in
and
said
we
must
go
over
to
the
ravine
that
evening
where
the
indians
were
going
to
have
a
rare
sort
of
a
dance
there
was
no
one
to
say
to
me
do
not
go
and
as
we
welcomed
any
little
excitement
which
would
relieve
the
monotony
of
our
lives
we
cast
aside
all
doubts
of
the
advisability
of
my
going
so
after
dinner
we
joined
the
others
and
sallied
forth
into
the
darkness
of
an
arizona
night
we
crossed
the
large
and
picked
our
way
over
a
rough
and
pathless
country
lighted
only
by
the
stars
above
arriving
at
the
edge
of
the
ravine
what
a
scene
was
before
us
we
looked
down
into
a
natural
amphitheatre
in
which
blazed
great
fires
hordes
of
wild
apaches
darted
about
while
others
sat
on
logs
beating
their
tomtoms
i
was
afraid
and
held
back
but
the
rest
of
the
party
descended
into
the
ravine
and
leaning
on
a
good
strong
arm
i
followed
we
all
sat
down
on
the
great
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
and
soon
the
dancers
came
into
the
arena
they
were
entirely
naked
except
for
the
their
bodies
were
painted
and
from
their
elbows
and
knees
stood
out
bunches
of
feathers
giving
them
the
appearance
of
huge
flying
creatures
jingling
things
were
attached
to
their
necks
and
arms
upon
their
heads
were
large
frames
made
to
resemble
the
branching
horns
of
an
elk
and
as
they
danced
and
bowed
their
heads
the
horns
lent
them
the
appearance
of
some
unknown
animal
and
added
greatly
to
their
height
their
feathers
waved
their
jingles
shook
and
their
painted
bodies
twisted
and
turned
in
the
light
of
the
great
fire
which
roared
and
leaped
on
high
at
one
moment
they
were
birds
at
another
animals
at
the
next
they
were
demons
the
noise
of
the
tomtoms
and
the
harsh
shouts
of
the
indians
grew
wilder
and
wilder
it
was
weird
and
terrifying
then
came
a
pause
the
arena
was
cleared
and
with
much
solemnity
two
creatures
came
out
and
performed
a
sort
of
shadow
dance
brandishing
knives
as
they
glided
through
the
intricate
figures
it
was
a
fascinating
but
unearthly
scene
and
the
setting
completed
the
illusion
fright
deprived
me
of
the
power
of
thought
but
in
a
sort
of
subconscious
way
i
felt
that
orpheus
must
have
witnessed
just
such
mad
revels
when
he
went
down
into
pluto
regions
suddenly
the
shouts
became
war
whoops
the
demons
brandished
their
knives
madly
and
nodded
their
branching
horns
the
tomtoms
were
beaten
with
a
dreadful
din
and
terror
seized
my
heart
what
if
they
be
treacherous
and
had
lured
our
small
party
down
into
this
ravine
for
an
ambush
the
thing
could
well
be
i
thought
i
saw
uneasiness
in
the
faces
of
the
other
women
and
by
mutual
consent
we
got
up
and
slowly
took
our
departure
i
barely
had
strength
to
climb
up
the
steep
side
of
the
hollow
i
was
thankful
to
escape
from
its
horrors
scarce
three
months
after
that
some
of
the
same
band
of
indians
fired
into
the
garrison
and
fled
to
the
mountains
i
remarked
to
jack
that
i
thought
we
were
very
imprudent
to
go
to
see
that
dance
and
he
said
he
supposed
we
were
but
i
had
never
regarded
life
in
such
a
light
way
as
he
seemed
to
women
usually
like
to
talk
over
their
trials
and
their
wonderful
adventures
and
that
is
why
i
am
writing
this
i
suppose
men
simply
will
not
talk
about
such
things
the
cavalry
beauty
seemed
to
look
at
this
frontier
life
philosophically
what
she
really
thought
about
it
i
never
knew
bailey
was
so
much
occupied
by
the
care
of
her
young
child
and
various
amusements
that
she
did
not
apparently
think
much
about
things
that
happened
around
us
at
all
events
she
never
seemed
inclined
to
talk
about
them
there
was
no
one
else
to
talk
to
the
soil
was
strange
and
the
atmosphere
a
foreign
one
to
me
life
did
not
seem
to
be
taken
seriously
out
there
as
it
was
back
in
new
england
where
they
always
loved
to
sit
down
and
talk
things
over
i
was
downright
lonesome
for
my
mother
and
sisters
i
could
not
go
out
very
much
at
that
time
so
i
occupied
myself
a
good
deal
with
one
evening
we
heard
firing
across
the
canon
jack
caught
up
his
sword
buckling
on
his
belt
as
he
went
out
injuns
fighting
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
some
soldier
reported
finding
that
it
did
not
concern
us
jack
said
come
out
into
the
back
yard
martha
and
look
over
the
stockade
and
i
think
you
can
see
across
the
river
so
i
hurried
out
to
the
stockade
but
jack
seeing
that
i
was
not
tall
enough
picked
up
an
empty
box
that
stood
under
the
window
of
the
room
belonging
to
the
doctor
when
thud
fell
something
out
onto
the
ground
and
rolled
away
i
started
involuntarily
it
was
dark
in
the
yard
i
stood
stock
still
what
was
that
i
whispered
nothing
but
an
old
edam
cheese
said
this
soldier
of
mine
i
knew
it
was
not
a
cheese
but
said
no
more
i
stood
up
on
the
box
watched
the
firing
like
a
man
and
went
quietly
back
into
the
quarters
after
retiring
i
said
you
might
just
a
swell
tell
me
now
you
will
have
to
sooner
or
later
what
was
in
the
box
it
had
a
dreadful
sound
as
it
rolled
away
on
the
ground
well
said
he
if
you
must
know
it
was
an
injun
head
that
the
doctor
had
saved
to
take
to
washington
with
him
it
had
a
sort
of
a
malformed
skull
or
or
something
but
he
left
it
behind
i
guess
it
got
a
leetle
to
old
for
him
to
carry
he
laughed
somebody
told
me
there
was
a
head
in
the
yard
but
i
forgot
all
about
it
lucky
thing
you
did
see
it
was
it
i
suppose
you
been
scared
well
i
must
tell
the
fatigue
party
to
take
it
away
now
do
let
me
forget
it
and
this
soldier
of
many
battles
fell
into
the
peaceful
slumber
which
comes
to
those
who
know
not
fear
the
next
day
i
overheard
him
telling
major
worth
what
had
happened
and
adding
that
he
would
roast
that
doctor
if
he
ever
came
back
i
was
seeing
the
rugged
side
of
life
indeed
and
getting
accustomed
to
shocks
now
the
cavalry
beauty
gave
a
dinner
it
was
lovely
but
in
the
midst
of
it
we
perceived
a
sort
of
confusion
of
moccasined
footsteps
outside
the
my
nerves
were
by
this
time
always
on
the
alert
i
glanced
through
the
large
door
opening
out
into
the
hall
and
saw
a
group
of
indian
scouts
they
laid
a
down
by
the
corner
near
the
front
door
the
commanding
officer
left
the
table
hastily
the
portiere
was
drawn
i
had
heard
tales
of
atrocious
cruelties
committed
by
a
band
of
indians
who
had
escaped
from
the
reservation
and
were
ravaging
the
country
around
i
had
heard
how
they
maimed
poor
sheep
and
cut
off
the
legs
of
cattle
at
the
first
joint
leaving
them
to
die
how
they
tortured
women
and
burned
their
husbands
and
children
before
their
eyes
i
had
heard
also
that
the
indian
scouts
were
out
after
them
with
orders
to
bring
them
in
dead
or
alive
the
next
day
i
learned
that
the
ringleader
head
was
in
the
bag
that
i
had
seen
and
that
the
others
had
surrendered
and
returned
the
scouts
were
apaches
in
the
pay
of
the
government
and
i
always
heard
that
as
long
as
they
were
serving
as
scouts
they
showed
themselves
loyal
and
would
hunt
down
their
nearest
relative
major
worth
got
tired
of
the
monotony
of
a
bachelor
life
at
camp
apache
and
decided
to
give
a
dance
in
his
quarters
and
invite
the
chiefs
i
think
the
other
officers
did
not
wholly
approve
of
it
although
they
felt
friendly
enough
towards
them
as
long
as
they
were
not
causing
disturbances
but
to
meet
the
savage
apache
on
a
basis
of
social
equality
in
an
officer
quarters
and
to
dance
in
a
quadrille
with
him
well
the
limit
of
all
things
had
been
reached
however
major
worth
who
was
actually
suffering
from
the
ennui
of
frontier
life
in
winter
and
in
time
of
peace
determined
to
carry
out
his
project
so
he
had
his
quarters
which
were
quite
spacious
cleared
and
decorated
with
evergreen
boughs
from
his
company
he
secured
some
men
who
could
play
the
banjo
and
guitar
and
all
the
officers
and
their
wives
and
the
chiefs
with
their
harems
came
to
this
novel
fete
a
quadrille
was
formed
in
which
the
chiefs
danced
opposite
the
officers
the
squaws
sat
around
as
they
were
too
shy
to
dance
these
chiefs
were
painted
and
wore
only
their
necklaces
and
the
customary
throwing
their
blankets
about
their
shoulders
when
they
had
finished
dancing
i
noticed
again
chief
diablo
great
good
looks
conversation
was
carried
on
principally
by
signs
and
nods
and
through
the
interpreter
a
white
man
named
cooley
besides
the
officers
had
picked
up
many
short
phrases
of
the
harsh
and
gutteral
apache
tongue
diablo
was
charmed
with
the
young
handsome
wife
of
one
of
the
officers
and
asked
her
husband
how
many
ponies
he
would
take
for
her
and
pedro
asked
major
worth
if
all
those
white
squaws
belonged
to
him
the
party
passed
off
pleasantly
enough
and
was
not
especially
subversive
to
discipline
although
i
believe
it
was
not
repeated
afterwards
long
afterwards
when
we
were
stationed
at
david
island
new
york
harbor
and
major
worth
was
no
longer
a
bachelor
but
a
dignified
married
man
and
had
gained
his
star
in
the
spanish
war
we
used
to
meet
occasionally
down
by
the
barge
office
or
taking
a
on
broadway
and
we
would
always
stand
awhile
and
chat
over
the
old
days
at
camp
apache
in
never
mind
how
pressing
our
mutual
engagements
were
we
could
never
forego
the
pleasure
of
talking
over
those
wild
days
and
contrasting
them
with
our
then
present
surroundings
shall
you
ever
forget
my
party
he
said
the
last
time
we
met
chapter
xiii
a
new
recruit
in
january
our
little
boy
arrived
to
share
our
fate
and
to
gladden
our
hearts
as
he
was
the
first
child
born
to
an
officer
family
in
camp
apache
there
was
the
greatest
excitement
all
the
and
cattlemen
for
miles
around
came
into
the
post
the
beneficent
canteen
with
its
soldiers
and
officers
clubrooms
did
not
exist
then
so
they
all
gathered
at
the
sutler
store
to
celebrate
events
with
a
round
of
drinks
they
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
and
congratulate
the
new
father
after
their
fashion
upon
the
advent
of
the
baby
their
great
hearts
went
out
to
him
and
they
vied
with
each
other
in
doing
the
handsome
thing
by
him
in
a
manner
according
to
their
lights
and
their
ideas
of
wishing
well
to
a
man
a
manner
sometimes
alas
disastrous
in
its
results
to
the
man
however
by
this
time
i
was
getting
used
to
all
sides
of
frontier
life
i
had
no
time
to
be
lonely
now
for
i
had
no
nurse
and
the
only
person
who
was
able
to
render
me
service
was
a
laundress
of
the
fifth
cavalry
who
came
for
about
two
hours
each
day
to
give
the
baby
his
bath
and
to
arrange
things
about
the
bed
i
begged
her
to
stay
with
me
but
of
course
i
knew
it
was
impossible
so
here
i
was
inexperienced
and
helpless
alone
in
bed
with
an
infant
a
few
days
old
loring
our
excellent
post
surgeon
was
both
kind
and
skillful
but
he
was
in
poor
health
and
expecting
each
day
to
be
ordered
to
another
station
my
husband
was
obliged
to
be
at
the
commissary
office
all
day
issuing
rations
to
troops
and
scouts
and
attending
to
the
duties
of
his
position
but
realizing
in
a
measure
the
utter
helplessness
of
my
situation
he
sent
a
soldier
up
to
lead
a
wire
cord
through
the
thick
wall
at
the
head
of
my
bed
and
out
through
the
small
yard
into
the
kitchen
to
this
they
attached
a
big
so
by
making
some
considerable
effort
to
reach
up
and
pull
this
wire
i
could
summon
bowen
that
is
if
bowen
happened
to
be
there
but
bowen
seemed
always
to
be
out
at
drill
or
over
at
the
company
quarters
and
frequently
my
bell
brought
no
response
when
he
did
come
however
he
was
just
as
kind
and
just
as
awkward
as
it
was
possible
for
a
great
big
to
be
but
i
grew
weaker
and
weaker
with
trying
to
be
strong
and
one
day
when
jack
came
in
and
found
both
the
baby
and
myself
crying
he
said
what
the
matter
i
said
i
must
have
some
one
to
take
care
of
me
or
we
shall
both
die
he
seemed
to
realize
that
the
situation
was
desperate
and
mounted
men
were
sent
out
immediately
in
all
directions
to
find
a
woman
at
last
a
mexican
girl
was
found
in
a
camp
and
was
brought
to
me
she
was
quite
young
and
very
ignorant
and
stupid
and
spoke
nothing
but
a
sort
of
mexican
lingo
and
did
not
understand
a
word
of
english
but
i
felt
that
my
life
was
saved
and
bowen
fixed
up
a
place
on
the
couch
for
her
to
sleep
and
jack
went
over
to
the
unoccupied
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
cabin
and
took
possession
of
the
absent
doctor
bed
i
begged
jack
to
hunt
up
a
spanish
dictionary
and
fortunately
one
was
found
at
the
sutler
store
which
doubtless
the
sutler
or
his
predecessor
had
brought
into
the
country
years
before
the
girl
did
not
know
anything
i
do
not
think
she
had
ever
been
inside
a
casa
before
she
had
washed
herself
in
mountain
streams
and
did
not
know
what
basins
and
sponges
were
for
so
it
was
of
no
use
to
point
to
the
objects
i
wanted
i
propped
myself
up
in
bed
and
studied
the
dictionary
and
having
some
idea
of
the
pronunciation
of
latin
languages
i
essayed
to
call
for
warm
water
and
various
other
necessary
articles
needed
around
a
sick
bed
sometimes
i
succeeded
in
getting
an
idea
through
her
impervious
brain
but
more
often
she
would
stand
dazed
and
immovable
and
i
would
let
the
dictionary
drop
from
my
tired
hands
and
fall
back
upon
the
pillow
in
a
sweat
of
exhaustion
then
bowen
would
be
called
in
and
with
the
help
of
some
perfunctory
language
and
gestures
on
his
part
this
silent
creature
of
the
mountains
would
seem
to
wake
up
and
try
to
understand
and
so
i
worried
through
those
dreadful
days
and
the
nights
ah
we
had
better
not
describe
them
the
poor
wild
thing
slept
the
sleep
of
death
and
could
not
hear
my
loudest
calls
nor
desperate
shouts
so
jack
attached
a
cord
to
her
pillow
and
i
would
tug
and
tug
at
that
and
pull
the
pillow
from
under
her
head
it
was
of
no
avail
she
slept
peacefully
on
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
i
lay
there
staring
at
her
that
not
even
gabriel
trump
would
ever
arouse
her
in
desperation
i
would
creep
out
of
bed
and
wait
upon
myself
and
then
confess
to
jack
and
the
doctor
next
day
well
we
had
to
let
the
creature
go
for
she
was
of
no
use
and
the
spanish
dictionary
was
laid
aside
i
struggled
along
fighting
against
odds
how
i
ever
got
well
at
all
is
a
wonder
when
i
think
of
all
the
sanitary
precautions
taken
with
young
mothers
and
babies
the
doctor
was
ordered
away
and
another
one
came
i
had
no
advice
or
help
from
any
one
calomel
or
quinine
are
the
only
medicines
i
remember
taking
myself
or
giving
to
my
child
but
to
go
back
a
little
the
seventh
day
after
the
birth
of
the
baby
a
delegation
of
several
squaws
wives
of
chiefs
came
to
pay
me
a
formal
visit
they
brought
me
some
finely
woven
baskets
and
a
beautiful
or
cradle
such
as
they
carry
their
own
babies
in
this
was
made
of
the
lightest
wood
and
covered
with
the
finest
skin
of
fawn
tanned
with
birch
bark
by
their
own
hands
and
embroidered
in
blue
beads
it
was
their
best
work
i
admired
it
and
tried
to
express
to
them
my
thanks
these
squaws
took
my
baby
he
was
lying
beside
me
on
the
bed
then
cooing
and
chuckling
they
looked
about
the
room
until
they
found
a
small
pillow
which
they
laid
into
the
then
put
my
baby
in
drew
the
flaps
together
and
laced
him
into
it
then
stood
it
up
and
laid
it
down
and
laughed
again
in
their
gentle
manner
and
finally
soothed
him
to
sleep
i
was
quite
touched
by
the
friendliness
of
it
all
they
laid
the
cradle
on
the
table
and
departed
jack
went
out
to
bring
major
worth
in
to
see
the
pretty
sight
and
as
the
two
entered
the
room
jack
pointed
to
the
major
worth
forward
and
gazed
into
the
cradle
he
did
not
speak
for
some
time
then
in
his
inimitable
way
and
half
under
his
breath
he
said
slowly
well
i
be
d
d
this
was
all
but
when
he
turned
towards
the
bedside
and
came
and
shook
my
hand
his
eyes
shone
with
a
gentle
and
tender
look
and
so
was
the
new
recruit
introduced
to
the
captain
of
company
and
now
there
must
be
a
for
the
baby
the
sutler
rummaged
his
entire
place
to
find
something
that
might
do
at
last
he
sent
me
a
freshly
scoured
tub
that
looked
as
if
it
might
at
no
very
remote
date
have
contained
salt
mackerel
marked
a
one
so
then
every
morning
at
nine
our
little
was
black
with
the
heads
of
the
curious
squaws
and
bucks
trying
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
fair
bath
a
wonderful
performance
it
appeared
to
them
once
a
week
this
room
which
was
now
a
nursery
combined
with
bedroom
and
was
overhauled
by
the
stalwart
bowen
the
baby
was
put
to
sleep
and
laced
securely
into
the
he
was
then
carried
into
the
kitchen
laid
on
the
dresser
and
i
sat
by
with
a
book
or
watching
him
until
bowen
had
finished
the
room
on
one
of
these
occasions
i
noticed
a
ledger
lying
upon
one
of
the
shelves
i
looked
into
it
and
imagine
my
astonishment
when
i
read
aunt
muffins
sarah
indian
pudding
and
on
another
page
hasty
lemon
tarts
aunt
susan
method
of
cooking
a
leg
of
mutton
and
josie
well
pressed
calf
liver
here
were
my
own
my
very
own
family
recipes
copied
into
bowen
ledger
in
large
illiterate
characters
and
on
the
charles
bowen
receipt
book
i
burst
into
a
good
hearty
laugh
almost
the
first
one
i
had
enjoyed
since
i
arrived
at
camp
apache
the
promotion
to
a
first
lieutenancy
came
at
about
this
time
jack
was
assigned
to
a
company
which
was
stationed
at
camp
macdowell
but
his
departure
for
the
new
post
was
delayed
until
the
spring
should
be
more
advanced
and
i
should
be
able
to
undertake
the
long
rough
trip
with
our
young
child
the
second
week
in
april
my
baby
just
nine
weeks
old
we
began
to
pack
up
i
had
gained
a
little
in
experience
to
be
sure
but
i
had
lost
my
health
and
strength
i
knew
nothing
of
the
care
of
a
young
infant
and
depended
entirely
upon
the
advice
of
the
post
surgeon
who
happened
at
that
time
to
be
a
young
man
much
better
versed
in
the
sawing
off
of
soldiers
legs
than
in
the
treatment
of
young
mothers
and
babies
the
packing
up
was
done
under
difficulties
and
with
much
help
from
our
faithful
bowen
it
was
arranged
for
bailey
who
was
to
spend
the
summer
with
her
parents
at
fort
whipple
to
make
the
trip
at
the
same
time
as
our
road
to
camp
macdowell
took
us
through
fort
whipple
there
were
provided
two
ambulances
with
six
mules
each
two
an
escort
of
six
calvarymen
fully
armed
and
a
guide
lieutenant
bailey
was
to
accompany
his
wife
on
the
trip
i
was
genuinely
sorry
to
part
with
major
worth
but
in
the
excitement
and
fatigue
of
breaking
up
our
home
i
had
little
time
to
think
of
my
feelings
my
young
child
absorbed
all
my
time
alas
for
the
ignorance
of
young
women
thrust
by
circumstances
into
such
a
situation
i
had
miscalculated
my
strength
for
i
had
never
known
illness
in
my
life
and
there
was
no
one
to
tell
me
any
better
i
reckoned
upon
my
superbly
healthy
nature
to
bring
me
through
in
fact
i
did
not
think
much
about
it
i
simply
got
ready
and
went
as
soldiers
do
i
heard
them
say
that
we
were
not
to
cross
the
mogollon
range
but
were
to
go
to
the
north
of
it
ford
the
colorado
chiquito
at
sunset
crossing
and
so
on
to
camp
verde
and
whipple
barracks
by
the
stoneman
lake
road
it
sounded
poetic
and
pretty
colorado
chiquito
sunset
crossing
and
stoneman
lake
road
i
thought
to
myself
they
were
prettier
than
any
of
the
names
i
had
heard
in
arizona
chapter
xiv
a
memorable
journey
how
broken
plunged
the
steep
descent
how
barren
desolate
and
rent
by
earthquake
shock
the
land
lay
dead
like
some
proud
king
in
slain
an
ugly
skeleton
it
gleamed
in
burning
sands
the
fiery
rain
of
fierce
volcanoes
here
had
sown
its
ashes
burnt
and
black
and
seamed
with
and
strewn
with
cinders
yea
so
overthrown
that
wilder
men
than
we
had
said
on
seeing
this
with
gathered
breath
we
come
on
the
confines
of
death
joaquin
miller
six
good
cavalrymen
galloped
along
by
our
side
on
the
morning
of
april
as
with
two
ambulances
two
army
wagons
and
a
mexican
guide
we
drove
out
of
camp
apache
at
a
brisk
trot
the
drivers
were
all
armed
and
spare
rifles
hung
inside
the
ambulances
i
wore
a
small
derringer
with
a
narrow
belt
filled
with
cartridges
an
incongruous
sight
methinks
now
it
must
have
been
a
young
mother
pale
and
thin
a
child
of
scarce
three
months
in
her
arms
and
a
pistol
belt
around
her
waist
i
scarcely
looked
back
at
camp
apache
we
had
a
long
day
march
before
us
and
we
looked
ahead
towards
night
we
made
camp
at
cooley
ranch
and
slept
inside
on
the
floor
cooley
was
interpreter
and
scout
and
although
he
was
a
white
man
he
had
married
a
young
indian
girl
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
chiefs
and
was
known
as
a
squaw
man
there
seemed
to
be
two
indian
girls
at
his
ranch
they
were
both
tidy
and
and
they
prepared
us
a
most
appetizing
supper
the
ranch
had
spaces
for
windows
covered
with
thin
unbleached
muslin
or
manta
as
it
is
always
called
out
there
glass
windows
being
then
too
great
a
luxury
in
that
remote
place
there
were
some
partitions
inside
the
ranch
but
no
doors
and
of
course
no
floors
except
adobe
several
children
nearly
naked
stood
and
gazed
at
us
as
we
prepared
for
rest
this
was
interesting
and
picturesque
from
many
standpoints
perhaps
but
it
did
not
tend
to
make
me
sleepy
i
lay
gazing
into
the
fire
which
was
smouldering
in
the
corner
and
finally
i
said
in
a
whisper
jack
which
girl
do
you
think
is
cooley
wife
i
do
know
answered
this
cross
and
tired
man
and
then
added
both
of
i
guess
now
this
was
too
awful
but
i
knew
he
did
not
intend
for
me
to
ask
any
more
questions
i
had
a
difficult
time
in
those
days
reconciling
what
i
saw
with
what
i
had
been
taught
was
right
and
i
had
to
sort
over
my
ideas
and
prejudices
a
good
many
times
the
two
pretty
squaws
prepared
a
nice
breakfast
for
us
and
we
set
out
quite
refreshed
to
travel
over
the
malapais
as
the
great
in
that
part
of
the
country
are
called
there
was
no
trace
of
a
road
a
few
hours
of
this
grinding
and
crunching
over
crushed
lava
wearied
us
all
and
the
animals
found
it
hard
pulling
although
the
country
was
level
we
crossed
silver
creek
without
difficulty
and
arrived
at
ranch
after
traveling
miles
mostly
malapais
do
not
for
a
moment
think
of
these
ranches
as
farms
some
of
them
were
deserted
sheep
ranches
and
had
only
adobe
walls
standing
in
ruins
but
the
camp
must
have
a
name
and
on
the
old
maps
of
arizona
these
names
are
still
to
be
found
of
course
on
the
new
railroad
maps
they
are
absent
they
were
generally
near
a
spring
or
a
creek
consequently
were
chosen
as
camps
bailey
had
her
boy
howard
with
her
we
began
to
experience
the
utmost
inconvenience
from
the
lack
of
warm
water
and
other
things
so
necessary
to
the
health
and
comfort
of
children
but
we
tried
to
make
light
of
it
all
and
the
two
lieutenants
tried
in
a
way
to
help
us
out
we
declared
we
must
have
some
clean
towels
for
the
next
day
so
we
tried
to
rinse
out
in
the
cold
hard
water
of
the
well
those
which
we
had
with
us
and
as
it
was
now
nightfall
and
there
was
no
fire
inside
this
apparently
deserted
ranch
the
two
lieutenants
stood
and
held
the
wet
towels
before
the
until
they
were
dry
bailey
and
i
too
tired
to
move
sat
and
watched
them
and
had
each
our
own
thoughts
she
was
an
army
girl
and
perhaps
had
seen
such
things
before
but
it
was
a
situation
that
did
not
seem
quite
in
keeping
with
my
ideas
of
the
fitness
of
things
in
general
and
with
the
uniform
in
particular
the
uniform
associated
in
my
mind
with
brilliant
functions
parades
and
weddings
the
uniform
in
fact
that
i
adored
as
i
sat
gazing
at
them
they
both
turned
around
and
realizing
how
almost
ludicrous
they
looked
they
began
to
laugh
whereupon
we
all
four
laughed
and
jack
said
nice
work
for
united
states
officers
hey
bailey
it
might
be
worse
sighed
the
handsome
bailey
thirty
miles
the
next
day
over
a
good
road
brought
us
to
ranch
on
the
site
of
old
camp
supply
this
ranch
was
habitable
in
a
way
and
the
owner
said
we
might
use
the
bedrooms
but
the
about
the
place
were
so
numerous
and
so
troublesome
in
the
night
that
we
could
not
sleep
i
have
mentioned
the
absence
of
windows
in
these
ranches
we
were
now
to
experience
the
great
inconvenience
resulting
therefrom
for
the
low
open
spaces
furnished
great
opportunity
for
the
cats
in
at
one
opening
and
out
at
another
they
flew
first
across
the
bailey
bed
then
over
ours
the
dogs
caught
the
spirit
of
the
chase
and
added
their
noise
to
that
of
the
cats
both
babies
began
to
cry
and
then
up
got
bailey
and
threw
his
heavy
campaign
boots
at
the
cats
with
some
fitting
remarks
a
momentary
silence
reigned
and
we
tried
again
to
sleep
back
came
the
cats
and
then
came
jack
turn
with
boots
and
travelling
satchels
it
was
all
of
no
avail
and
we
resigned
ourselves
cruelly
tired
here
we
were
we
two
women
compelled
to
sit
on
hard
boxes
or
the
edge
of
a
bed
to
quiet
our
poor
babies
all
through
that
night
at
that
old
like
the
wretched
emigrant
differing
only
from
her
inasmuch
as
she
never
having
known
comfort
perhaps
can
not
realize
her
misery
the
two
lieutenants
slipped
on
their
blouses
and
sat
looking
helplessly
at
us
waging
war
on
the
cats
at
intervals
and
so
the
dawn
found
us
our
nerves
at
a
tension
and
our
strength
gone
a
poor
preparation
for
the
trying
day
which
was
to
follow
we
were
able
to
buy
a
couple
of
sheep
there
to
take
with
us
for
supplies
and
some
antelope
meat
we
could
not
indulge
in
foolish
scruples
but
i
tried
not
to
look
when
they
tied
the
live
sheep
and
threw
them
into
one
of
the
wagons
quite
early
in
the
day
we
met
a
man
who
said
he
had
been
fired
upon
by
some
indians
at
sanford
pass
we
thought
perhaps
he
had
been
scared
by
some
stray
shot
and
we
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
his
story
soon
after
however
we
passed
a
sort
of
old
adobe
ruin
out
of
which
crept
two
mexicans
so
badly
frightened
that
their
dark
faces
were
pallid
their
hair
seemed
standing
on
end
and
they
looked
stark
mad
with
fear
they
talked
wildly
to
the
guide
and
gesticulated
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
pass
they
had
been
fired
at
and
their
ponies
taken
by
some
roving
apaches
they
had
been
in
hiding
for
over
a
day
and
were
hungry
and
miserable
we
gave
them
food
and
drink
they
implored
us
by
the
holy
virgin
not
to
go
through
the
pass
what
was
to
be
done
the
officers
took
counsel
the
men
looked
to
their
arms
it
was
decided
to
go
through
jack
examined
his
revolver
and
saw
that
my
pistol
was
loaded
i
was
instructed
minutely
what
to
do
in
case
we
were
attacked
for
miles
we
strained
our
eyes
looking
in
the
direction
whence
these
men
had
come
at
last
in
we
approached
the
pass
a
narrow
defile
winding
down
between
high
hills
from
this
to
the
plain
below
to
say
that
we
feared
an
ambush
would
not
perhaps
convey
a
very
clear
idea
of
how
i
felt
on
entering
the
pass
there
was
not
a
word
spoken
i
obeyed
orders
and
lay
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
ambulance
i
took
my
derringer
out
of
the
holster
and
cocked
it
i
looked
at
my
little
boy
lying
helpless
there
beside
me
and
at
his
delicate
temples
lined
with
thin
blue
veins
and
wondered
if
i
could
follow
out
the
instructions
i
had
received
for
jack
had
said
after
the
decision
was
made
to
go
through
the
pass
now
mattie
i
do
think
for
a
minute
that
there
are
any
injuns
in
that
pass
and
you
must
not
be
afraid
we
have
got
to
go
through
it
any
way
but
he
hesitated
we
may
be
mistaken
there
may
be
a
few
of
them
in
there
and
they
have
a
mighty
good
chance
to
get
in
a
shot
or
two
and
now
listen
if
i
hit
you
know
what
to
do
you
have
your
derringer
and
when
you
see
that
there
is
no
help
for
it
if
they
get
away
with
the
whole
outfit
why
there
only
one
thing
to
be
done
do
let
them
get
the
baby
for
they
will
carry
you
both
off
and
well
you
know
the
squaws
are
much
more
cruel
than
the
bucks
do
let
them
get
either
of
you
alive
now
to
the
driver
go
on
jack
was
a
man
of
few
words
and
seldom
spoke
much
in
times
like
that
so
i
lay
very
quiet
in
the
bottom
of
the
ambulance
i
realized
that
we
were
in
great
danger
my
thoughts
flew
back
to
the
east
and
i
saw
as
in
a
flash
my
father
and
mother
sisters
and
brother
i
think
i
tried
to
say
a
short
prayer
for
them
and
that
they
might
never
know
the
worst
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
my
husband
face
there
he
sat
rifle
in
hand
his
features
motionless
his
eyes
keenly
watching
out
from
one
side
of
the
ambulance
while
a
stalwart
carbine
in
hand
watched
the
other
side
of
the
narrow
defile
the
minutes
seemed
like
hours
the
driver
kept
his
animals
steady
and
we
rattled
along
at
last
as
i
perceived
the
steep
slope
of
the
road
i
looked
out
and
saw
that
the
pass
was
widening
out
and
we
must
be
nearing
the
end
of
it
keep
still
said
jack
without
moving
a
feature
my
heart
seemed
then
to
stop
beating
and
i
dared
not
move
again
until
i
heard
him
say
thank
god
we
out
of
it
get
up
mattie
see
the
river
yonder
cross
that
and
then
we
be
out
of
their
god
d
d
country
this
was
jack
way
of
working
off
his
excitement
and
i
did
not
mind
it
i
knew
he
was
not
afraid
of
apaches
for
himself
but
for
his
wife
and
child
and
if
i
had
been
a
man
i
should
have
said
just
as
much
and
perhaps
more
we
were
now
down
in
a
flat
country
and
low
alkali
plains
lay
between
us
and
the
river
my
nerves
gradually
recovered
from
the
tension
in
which
they
had
been
held
the
driver
stopped
his
team
for
a
moment
the
other
ambulance
drove
up
alongside
of
us
and
ella
bailey
and
i
looked
at
each
other
we
did
not
talk
any
but
i
believe
we
cried
just
a
little
then
bailey
and
jack
thinking
we
were
giving
way
i
suppose
pulled
out
their
big
flasks
and
we
had
to
take
a
cup
of
good
whiskey
weakened
up
with
a
little
water
from
our
canteens
which
had
been
filled
at
ranch
in
the
morning
great
heavens
i
thought
was
it
this
morning
that
we
left
walker
ranch
or
was
it
a
year
ago
so
much
had
i
lived
through
in
a
few
hours
chapter
xv
fording
the
little
colorado
at
a
bend
in
the
road
the
mexican
guide
galloped
up
near
the
ambulance
and
pointing
off
to
the
westward
with
a
graceful
gesture
said
colorado
chiquito
colorado
chiquito
and
sure
enough
there
in
the
afternoon
sun
lay
the
narrow
winding
river
its
surface
as
smooth
as
glass
and
its
banks
as
if
covered
with
snow
we
drove
straight
for
the
ford
known
as
sunset
crossing
the
guide
was
sure
he
knew
the
place
but
the
river
was
high
and
i
could
not
see
how
anybody
could
cross
it
without
a
boat
the
mexican
rode
his
pony
in
once
or
twice
shook
his
head
and
said
in
spanish
there
was
much
quicksand
the
old
ford
had
changed
much
since
he
saw
it
he
galloped
excitedly
to
and
fro
along
the
bank
of
the
river
always
returning
to
the
same
place
and
declaring
it
was
the
ford
there
was
no
other
he
knew
it
well
but
the
wagons
not
having
yet
arrived
it
was
decided
not
to
attempt
crossing
until
morning
when
we
could
get
a
fresh
start
the
sun
was
gradually
sinking
in
the
west
but
the
heat
down
in
that
alkali
even
at
that
early
season
of
the
year
was
most
uncomfortable
i
was
worn
out
with
fright
and
fatigue
my
poor
child
cried
piteously
and
incessantly
nothing
was
of
any
avail
to
soothe
him
after
the
tents
were
pitched
and
the
made
some
warm
water
was
brought
and
i
tried
to
wash
away
some
of
the
dust
from
him
but
the
alkali
water
only
irritated
his
delicate
skin
and
his
head
where
it
had
lain
on
my
arm
was
inflamed
by
the
constant
rubbing
it
began
to
break
out
in
ugly
blisters
i
was
in
despair
we
were
about
as
wretchedly
off
as
two
human
beings
could
be
and
live
it
seemed
to
me
the
disappointment
at
not
getting
across
the
river
combined
with
the
fear
that
the
indians
were
still
in
the
neighborhood
added
to
my
nervousness
and
produced
an
exhaustion
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
meant
collapse
the
mournful
and
demoniacal
cries
of
the
coyotes
filled
the
night
they
seemed
to
come
close
to
the
tent
and
their
number
seemed
to
be
legion
i
lay
with
eyes
wide
open
watching
for
the
day
to
come
and
resolving
each
minute
that
if
i
ever
escaped
alive
from
that
lonely
with
its
burning
alkali
and
its
millions
of
howling
coyotes
i
would
never
never
risk
being
placed
in
such
a
situation
again
at
dawn
everybody
got
up
and
dressed
i
looked
in
my
small
and
it
seemed
to
me
my
hair
had
turned
a
greyish
color
and
while
it
was
not
exactly
white
the
warm
chestnut
tinge
never
came
back
into
it
after
that
day
and
night
of
terror
my
eyes
looked
back
at
me
large
and
hollow
from
the
small
glass
and
i
was
in
that
state
when
it
is
easy
to
imagine
the
look
of
death
in
one
own
face
i
think
sometimes
it
comes
after
we
have
thought
ourselves
near
the
borders
and
i
surely
had
been
close
to
them
the
day
before
if
perchance
any
of
my
readers
have
followed
this
narrative
so
far
and
there
be
among
them
possibly
any
men
young
or
old
i
would
say
to
such
ones
desist
for
what
i
am
going
to
tell
about
in
this
chapter
and
possibly
another
concerns
nobody
but
women
and
my
story
will
now
for
awhile
not
concern
itself
with
the
eighth
foot
nor
the
army
nor
the
war
department
nor
the
interior
department
nor
the
strategic
value
of
sunset
crossing
which
may
now
be
a
railroad
station
for
all
i
know
it
is
simply
a
story
of
my
journey
from
the
far
bank
of
the
little
colorado
to
fort
whipple
and
then
on
by
a
change
of
orders
over
mountains
and
valleys
cactus
plains
and
desert
lands
to
the
banks
of
the
great
colorado
my
attitude
towards
the
places
i
travelled
through
was
naturally
influenced
by
the
fact
that
i
had
a
young
baby
in
my
arms
the
entire
way
and
that
i
was
not
able
to
endure
hardship
at
that
time
for
usually
be
it
remembered
at
that
period
of
a
child
life
both
mother
and
infant
are
not
out
of
the
hands
of
the
doctor
and
trained
nurse
to
say
nothing
of
the
assistance
so
gladly
rendered
by
those
near
and
dear
the
morning
of
the
of
april
dawned
shortly
after
midnight
as
mornings
in
arizona
generally
do
at
that
season
and
after
a
hasty
camp
breakfast
and
a
good
deal
of
reconnoitering
on
the
part
of
the
officers
who
did
not
seem
to
be
exactly
satisfied
about
the
knowledge
of
the
ford
they
told
him
to
push
his
pony
in
and
cross
if
he
could
he
managed
to
pick
his
way
across
and
back
after
a
good
deal
of
floundering
and
we
decided
to
try
the
ford
first
they
hitched
up
ten
mules
to
one
of
the
heavily
loaded
the
teamster
cracked
his
whip
and
in
they
went
but
the
quicksand
frightened
the
leaders
and
they
lost
their
courage
now
when
a
mule
loses
courage
in
the
water
he
puts
his
head
down
and
is
done
for
the
leaders
disappeared
entirely
then
the
next
two
and
finally
the
whole
ten
of
them
were
gone
irrevocably
as
i
thought
but
like
a
flash
the
officers
shouted
cut
away
those
mules
jump
in
there
and
amid
other
expletives
the
men
plunged
in
and
feeling
around
under
the
water
cut
the
poor
animals
loose
and
they
began
to
crawl
out
on
the
other
bank
i
drew
a
long
breath
for
i
thought
the
ten
mules
were
drowned
the
guide
picked
his
way
over
again
to
the
other
side
and
caught
them
up
and
then
i
began
to
wonder
how
on
earth
we
should
ever
get
across
there
lay
the
heavy
army
wagon
deep
mired
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
what
did
i
see
our
army
chests
floating
away
down
the
river
i
cried
out
oh
do
save
our
chests
they
all
right
we
get
them
presently
said
jack
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
me
before
the
soldiers
could
get
them
to
the
bank
which
they
did
with
the
aid
of
stout
ropes
all
our
worldly
goods
were
in
those
chests
and
i
knew
they
were
soaked
wet
and
probably
ruined
but
after
all
what
did
it
matter
in
the
face
of
the
serious
problem
which
confronted
us
in
the
meantime
some
of
the
men
had
floated
the
other
boxes
and
trunks
out
of
the
wagon
back
to
the
shore
and
were
busy
taking
the
huge
vehicle
apart
any
one
who
knows
the
size
of
an
army
wagon
will
realize
that
this
was
hard
work
especially
as
the
wagon
was
mired
and
nearly
submerged
but
the
men
worked
desperately
and
at
last
succeeded
in
getting
every
part
of
it
back
onto
the
dry
land
somebody
stirred
up
the
and
put
the
kettle
on
and
bailey
and
i
mixed
up
a
smoking
strong
hot
toddy
for
those
brave
fellows
who
were
by
this
time
well
exhausted
then
they
set
to
work
to
make
a
boat
by
drawing
a
large
canvas
under
the
body
of
the
wagon
and
fastening
it
securely
for
this
lieutenant
of
mine
had
been
a
and
knew
well
how
to
meet
emergencies
one
or
two
of
the
soldiers
had
now
forded
the
stream
on
horseback
and
taken
over
a
heavy
rope
which
was
made
fast
to
our
improvised
boat
i
was
acquainted
with
all
kinds
of
boats
from
a
catamaran
to
a
ship
but
never
a
craft
like
this
had
i
seen
over
the
sides
we
clambered
however
and
were
ferried
across
the
treacherous
and
glassy
waters
of
the
little
colorado
all
the
baggage
and
the
two
ambulances
were
ferried
over
and
the
other
wagon
was
unloaded
and
drawn
over
by
means
of
ropes
this
proceeding
took
all
day
and
of
course
we
could
get
no
farther
and
were
again
obliged
to
camp
in
that
most
uncomfortable
but
we
felt
safer
on
that
side
i
looked
at
the
smooth
surface
of
the
river
and
its
alkali
shores
and
the
picture
became
indelibly
impressed
upon
my
memory
the
unpleasant
reality
destroyed
any
poetic
associations
which
might
otherwise
have
clung
to
the
name
of
sunset
crossing
in
my
ever
vivid
imagination
after
the
tents
were
pitched
and
the
camp
snugged
up
bailey
produced
some
champagne
and
we
wished
each
other
joy
that
we
had
made
the
dangerous
crossing
and
escaped
the
perils
of
sanford
pass
i
am
afraid
the
champagne
was
not
as
cold
as
might
have
been
desired
but
the
bottle
had
been
wrapped
in
a
wet
blanket
and
cooled
a
little
in
that
way
and
we
drank
it
with
zest
from
a
chapter
xvi
stoneman
lake
the
road
began
now
to
ascend
and
after
twenty
miles
travelling
we
reached
a
place
called
updyke
tanks
it
was
a
nice
place
with
plenty
of
wood
and
grass
the
next
day
we
camped
at
jay
coxe
tanks
it
was
a
hard
day
march
and
i
was
tired
out
when
we
arrived
there
the
ambulance
was
simply
jerked
over
those
miles
of
fearful
rocks
one
could
not
say
driven
or
dragged
over
for
we
were
pitched
from
rock
to
rock
the
entire
distance
stoneman
lake
road
was
famous
as
i
afterwards
heard
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
for
me
that
i
did
not
know
about
it
in
advance
the
mules
picked
their
way
over
these
rocks
there
was
not
a
moment
respite
we
asked
a
soldier
to
help
with
holding
the
baby
for
my
arms
gave
out
entirely
and
were
as
if
paralyzed
the
jolting
threw
us
all
by
turns
against
the
sides
of
the
ambulance
which
was
not
padded
and
we
all
got
some
rather
bad
bruises
we
finally
bethought
ourselves
of
the
pappoose
basket
which
we
had
brought
along
in
the
ambulance
having
at
the
last
moment
no
other
place
to
put
it
so
a
halt
was
called
we
placed
the
tired
baby
in
this
laced
the
sides
snugly
over
him
and
were
thus
enabled
to
carry
him
over
those
dreadful
roads
without
danger
he
did
not
cry
much
but
the
dust
made
him
thirsty
i
could
not
give
him
nourishment
without
stopping
the
entire
train
of
wagons
on
account
of
the
constant
pitching
of
the
ambulance
delay
was
not
advisable
or
expedient
so
my
poor
little
son
had
to
endure
with
the
rest
of
us
the
big
alsatian
cavalryman
held
the
cradle
easily
in
his
strong
arms
and
so
the
long
miles
were
travelled
one
by
one
at
noon
of
this
day
we
made
a
refreshing
halt
built
a
fire
and
took
some
luncheon
we
found
a
shady
grassy
spot
upon
which
the
blankets
were
spread
and
we
stretched
ourselves
out
upon
them
and
rested
but
we
were
still
some
miles
from
water
so
after
a
short
respite
we
were
compelled
to
push
on
we
had
been
getting
steadily
higher
since
leaving
sunset
crossing
and
now
it
began
to
be
cold
and
looked
like
snow
bailey
and
i
found
it
very
trying
to
meet
these
changes
of
temperature
a
good
place
for
the
camp
was
found
at
coxe
tanks
trenches
were
dug
around
the
tents
and
the
earth
banked
up
to
keep
us
warm
the
cool
air
our
great
fatigue
and
the
comparative
absence
of
danger
combined
to
give
us
a
heavenly
night
rest
towards
sunset
of
the
next
day
which
was
may
day
our
cavalcade
reached
stoneman
lake
we
had
had
another
rough
march
and
had
reached
the
limit
of
endurance
or
thought
we
had
when
we
emerged
from
a
mountain
pass
and
drew
rein
upon
the
high
green
mesa
overlooking
stoneman
lake
a
beautiful
blue
sheet
of
water
lying
there
away
below
us
it
was
good
to
our
tired
eyes
which
had
gazed
upon
nothing
but
burnt
rocks
and
alkali
plains
for
so
many
days
our
camp
was
beautiful
beyond
description
and
lay
near
the
edge
of
the
mesa
whence
we
could
look
down
upon
the
lovely
lake
it
was
a
complete
surprise
to
us
as
points
of
scenery
were
not
much
known
or
talked
about
then
in
arizona
ponds
and
lakes
were
unheard
of
they
did
not
seem
to
exist
in
that
drear
land
of
arid
wastes
we
never
heard
of
water
except
that
of
the
colorado
or
the
gila
or
the
tanks
and
basins
and
irrigation
ditches
of
the
settlers
but
here
was
a
real
italian
lake
a
lake
as
blue
as
the
skies
above
us
we
feasted
our
eyes
and
our
very
souls
upon
it
bailey
and
the
guide
shot
some
wild
turkeys
and
as
we
had
already
eaten
all
the
mutton
we
had
along
the
ragout
of
turkey
made
by
the
for
our
supper
tasted
better
to
us
tired
and
hungry
travellers
perhaps
than
a
canvasback
at
delmonico
tastes
to
the
weary
lounger
or
the
financier
in
the
course
of
the
day
we
had
passed
a
sort
of
with
the
rudely
written
inscription
camp
starvation
and
we
had
heard
from
bailey
the
story
of
the
tragic
misfortunes
at
this
very
place
of
the
hitchcock
family
of
arizona
the
road
was
lined
with
dry
bones
and
skulls
of
oxen
white
and
bleached
in
the
sun
lying
on
the
bare
rocks
indeed
at
every
stage
of
the
road
we
had
seen
evidences
of
hard
travel
exhausted
cattle
anxious
teamsters
hunger
and
thirst
despair
starvation
and
death
however
stoneman
lake
remains
a
joy
in
the
memory
and
far
and
away
the
most
beautiful
spot
i
ever
saw
in
arizona
but
unless
the
approaches
to
it
are
made
easier
tourists
will
never
gaze
upon
it
in
the
distance
we
saw
the
divide
over
which
we
must
pass
in
order
to
reach
camp
verde
which
was
to
be
our
first
stopping
place
and
we
looked
joyfully
towards
the
next
day
march
which
we
expected
would
bring
us
there
we
thought
the
worst
was
over
and
before
retiring
to
our
tents
for
the
night
we
walked
over
to
the
edge
of
the
high
mesa
and
in
the
gathering
shadows
of
twilight
looked
down
into
the
depths
of
that
beautiful
lake
knowing
that
probably
we
should
never
see
it
again
and
indeed
in
all
the
years
i
spent
in
arizona
afterward
i
never
even
heard
of
the
lake
again
i
wonder
now
did
it
really
exist
or
was
it
an
illusion
a
dream
or
the
mirage
which
appears
to
the
desert
traveller
to
satisfy
him
and
lure
him
on
to
quiet
his
imagination
and
to
save
his
senses
from
utter
extinction
in
the
morning
the
camp
was
all
astir
for
an
early
move
we
had
no
time
to
look
back
we
were
starting
for
a
long
day
march
across
the
divide
and
into
camp
verde
but
we
soon
found
that
the
road
if
road
it
could
be
called
was
worse
than
any
we
had
encountered
the
ambulance
was
pitched
and
jerked
from
rock
to
rock
and
we
were
thumped
against
the
iron
framework
in
a
most
dangerous
manner
so
we
got
out
and
picked
our
way
over
the
great
sharp
boulders
the
alsatian
soldier
carried
the
baby
who
lay
securely
in
the
pappoose
cradle
one
of
the
cavalry
escort
suggested
my
taking
his
horse
but
i
did
not
feel
strong
enough
to
think
of
mounting
a
horse
so
great
was
my
discouragement
and
so
exhausted
was
my
vitality
oh
if
girls
only
knew
about
these
things
i
thought
for
just
a
little
knowledge
of
the
care
of
an
infant
and
its
needs
its
nourishment
and
its
habits
might
have
saved
both
mother
and
child
from
such
utter
collapse
little
by
little
we
gave
up
hope
of
reaching
verde
that
day
at
four
we
crossed
the
divide
and
clattered
down
a
road
so
near
the
edge
of
a
precipice
that
i
was
frightened
beyond
everything
my
senses
nearly
left
me
down
and
around
this
way
and
that
near
the
edge
then
back
again
swaying
swerving
pitching
the
gravel
clattering
over
the
precipice
the
six
mules
trotting
their
fastest
we
reached
the
bottom
and
the
driver
pulled
up
his
team
beaver
springs
said
he
impressively
loosening
up
the
brakes
as
jack
lifted
me
out
of
the
ambulance
i
said
why
did
you
tell
me
pointing
back
to
the
steep
road
oh
said
he
i
thought
it
was
better
for
you
not
to
know
people
get
scared
about
such
things
when
they
know
about
them
before
hand
but
i
remarked
such
a
pace
then
to
the
driver
smith
how
could
you
drive
down
that
place
at
such
a
rate
and
frighten
me
so
had
to
or
we
over
the
edge
i
had
been
brought
up
in
a
flat
country
down
near
the
sea
and
i
did
not
know
the
dangers
of
mountain
travelling
nor
the
difficulties
attending
the
piloting
of
a
team
down
a
road
like
that
from
this
time
on
however
smith
rose
in
my
estimation
i
seemed
also
to
be
realizing
that
the
southwest
was
a
great
country
and
that
there
was
much
to
learn
about
life
out
there
was
beginning
to
interest
me
camp
verde
lay
sixteen
miles
farther
on
no
one
knew
if
the
road
were
good
or
bad
i
declared
i
could
not
travel
another
mile
even
if
they
all
went
on
and
left
me
to
the
wolves
and
the
darkness
of
beaver
springs
we
looked
to
our
provisions
and
took
account
of
stock
there
was
not
enough
for
the
two
families
we
had
no
flour
and
no
bread
there
was
only
a
small
piece
of
bacon
six
potatoes
some
condensed
milk
and
some
chocolate
the
baileys
decided
to
go
on
for
bailey
was
to
meet
her
sister
at
verde
and
her
parents
at
whipple
we
said
and
their
ambulance
rolled
away
our
tent
was
pitched
and
the
baby
was
laid
on
the
bed
asleep
from
pure
exhaustion
the
dread
darkness
of
night
descended
upon
us
and
the
strange
odors
of
the
arose
mingling
with
the
delicious
smoky
smell
of
the
by
the
light
of
the
blazing
mesquite
wood
we
now
divided
what
provisions
we
had
into
two
portions
one
for
supper
and
one
for
breakfast
a
very
light
meal
we
had
that
evening
and
i
arose
from
the
unsatisfied
and
hungry
jack
and
i
sat
down
by
the
musing
over
the
hard
times
we
were
having
when
suddenly
i
heard
a
terrified
cry
from
my
little
son
we
rushed
to
the
tent
lighted
a
candle
and
oh
horror
upon
horrors
his
head
and
face
were
covered
with
large
black
ants
he
was
wailing
helplessly
and
beating
the
air
with
his
tiny
arms
my
god
cried
jack
we
camped
over
an
i
seized
the
child
and
brushing
off
the
ants
as
i
fled
brought
him
out
to
the
fire
where
by
its
light
i
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
them
all
but
the
horror
of
it
can
any
mother
brought
up
in
god
country
with
kind
nurses
and
loved
ones
to
minister
to
her
child
for
a
moment
imagine
how
i
felt
when
i
saw
those
hideous
black
ants
crawling
over
my
baby
face
after
a
lapse
of
years
i
can
not
recall
that
moment
without
a
shudder
the
soldiers
at
last
found
a
place
which
seemed
to
be
free
from
and
our
tent
was
again
pitched
but
only
to
find
that
the
venomous
things
swarmed
over
us
as
soon
as
we
lay
down
to
rest
and
so
after
the
fashion
of
the
missouri
emigrant
we
climbed
into
the
ambulance
and
lay
down
upon
our
blankets
in
the
bottom
of
it
and
tried
to
believe
we
were
comfortable
my
long
hard
journey
of
the
preceding
autumn
covering
a
period
of
two
months
my
trying
experiences
during
the
winter
at
camp
apache
the
sudden
and
the
packing
the
lack
of
assistance
from
a
nurse
the
terrors
of
the
journey
the
sympathy
for
my
child
who
suffered
from
many
ailments
and
principally
from
lack
of
nourishment
added
to
the
profound
fatigue
i
felt
had
reduced
my
strength
to
a
minimum
i
wonder
that
i
lived
but
something
sustained
me
and
when
we
reached
camp
verde
the
next
day
and
drew
up
before
lieutenant
quarters
and
saw
kind
face
beaming
to
welcome
us
i
felt
that
here
was
relief
at
last
the
tall
alsatian
handed
the
pappoose
cradle
to
gracious
goodness
what
is
this
cried
the
bewildered
woman
surely
it
can
not
be
your
baby
you
have
turned
entirely
indian
have
you
amongst
those
wild
apaches
i
felt
sorry
i
had
not
taken
him
out
of
the
basket
before
we
arrived
i
did
not
realize
the
impression
it
would
make
at
camp
verde
after
all
they
did
not
know
anything
about
our
life
at
apache
or
our
rough
travels
to
get
back
from
there
here
were
windows
women
smart
uniforms
and
in
fact
civilization
compared
with
what
we
had
left
the
women
of
the
post
gathered
around
the
broad
piazza
to
see
the
wonder
but
when
they
saw
the
poor
little
wan
face
the
blue
eyes
which
looked
sadly
out
at
them
from
this
rude
cradle
the
linen
bandages
covering
the
back
of
the
head
they
did
not
laugh
any
more
but
took
him
and
ministered
to
him
as
only
kind
women
can
minister
to
a
sick
baby
there
was
not
much
rest
however
for
we
had
to
sort
and
rearrange
our
things
and
dress
ourselves
properly
oh
the
luxury
of
a
room
and
a
tub
after
that
journey
jack
put
on
his
best
uniform
and
there
was
no
end
of
visiting
in
spite
of
the
heat
which
was
considerable
even
at
that
early
date
in
may
the
day
there
would
have
been
pleasant
enough
but
for
my
wretched
condition
the
next
morning
we
set
out
for
fort
whipple
making
a
long
day
march
and
arriving
late
in
the
evening
the
wife
of
the
quartermaster
a
total
stranger
to
me
received
us
and
before
we
had
time
to
exchange
the
usual
social
platitudes
she
gave
one
look
at
the
baby
and
put
an
end
to
any
such
attempts
you
have
a
sick
child
give
him
to
me
then
i
told
her
some
things
and
she
said
i
wonder
he
is
alive
then
she
took
him
under
her
charge
and
declared
we
should
not
leave
her
house
until
he
was
well
again
she
understood
all
about
nursing
and
day
by
day
under
her
good
care
and
doctor
henry
lippincott
skilful
treatment
i
saw
my
baby
brought
back
to
life
again
can
i
ever
forget
aldrich
blessed
kindness
up
to
then
i
had
taken
no
interest
in
camp
macdowell
where
was
stationed
the
company
into
which
my
husband
was
promoted
i
knew
it
was
somewhere
in
the
southern
part
of
the
territory
and
isolated
the
present
was
enough
i
was
meeting
my
old
fort
russell
friends
and
under
doctor
lippincott
good
care
i
was
getting
back
a
measure
of
strength
camp
macdowell
was
not
yet
a
reality
to
me
we
met
again
colonel
wilkins
and
wilkins
and
carrie
and
wilkins
thanked
me
for
bringing
her
daughter
alive
out
of
those
wilds
poor
girl
was
but
a
few
months
when
we
heard
of
her
death
at
the
birth
of
her
second
child
i
have
always
thought
her
death
was
caused
by
the
long
hard
journey
from
apache
to
whipple
for
nature
never
intended
women
to
go
through
what
we
went
through
on
that
memorable
journey
by
stoneman
lake
there
i
met
again
captain
porter
and
i
asked
him
if
he
had
progressed
any
in
his
courtship
and
he
being
very
much
embarrassed
said
he
did
not
know
but
if
patient
waiting
was
of
any
avail
he
believed
he
might
win
his
bride
after
we
had
been
at
whipple
a
few
days
jack
came
in
and
remarked
casually
to
lieutenant
aldrich
well
i
heard
bernard
has
asked
to
be
relieved
from
ehrenberg
what
i
said
the
lonely
man
down
there
on
the
river
the
prisoner
of
chillon
the
silent
one
well
they
are
going
to
relieve
him
of
course
why
yes
said
jack
falteringly
if
they
can
get
anyone
to
take
his
place
ca
they
order
some
one
i
inquired
of
course
they
can
he
replied
and
then
turning
towards
the
window
he
ventured
the
fact
is
martha
i
been
offered
it
and
am
thinking
it
over
the
real
truth
was
that
he
had
applied
for
it
thinking
it
possessed
great
advantages
over
camp
macdowell
what
do
i
hear
aright
have
your
senses
left
you
are
you
crazy
are
you
going
to
take
me
to
that
awful
place
why
jack
i
should
die
there
now
martha
be
reasonable
listen
to
me
and
if
you
really
decide
against
it
i
throw
up
the
detail
but
do
you
see
we
shall
be
right
on
the
river
the
boat
comes
up
every
fortnight
or
so
you
can
jump
aboard
and
go
up
to
san
francisco
oh
how
alluring
that
sounded
to
my
ears
why
it
no
trouble
to
get
out
of
arizona
from
ehrenberg
then
too
i
shall
be
independent
and
can
do
just
as
i
like
and
when
i
like
et
caetera
et
caetera
oh
you
be
making
the
greatest
mistake
if
you
decide
against
it
as
for
macdowell
it
a
hell
of
a
place
down
there
in
the
south
and
you
never
will
be
able
to
go
back
east
with
the
baby
if
we
once
get
settled
down
there
why
it
a
good
fifteen
days
from
the
river
and
so
he
piled
up
the
arguments
in
favor
of
ehrenberg
saying
finally
you
need
not
stop
a
day
there
if
the
boat
happens
to
be
up
you
can
jump
right
aboard
and
start
at
once
down
river
all
the
discomforts
of
the
voyage
on
the
newbern
and
the
memory
of
those
long
days
spent
on
the
river
steamer
in
august
had
paled
before
my
recent
experiences
i
flew
in
imagination
to
the
deck
of
the
gila
and
to
good
captain
mellon
who
would
take
me
and
my
child
out
of
that
wretched
territory
yes
yes
let
us
go
then
i
cried
for
here
came
in
my
inexperience
i
thought
i
was
choosing
the
lesser
evil
and
i
knew
that
jack
believed
it
to
be
so
and
also
that
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
ehrenberg
for
reasons
known
only
to
the
understanding
of
a
military
man
so
it
was
decided
to
take
the
ehrenberg
detail
chapter
xvii
the
colorado
desert
some
serpents
slid
from
out
the
grass
that
grew
in
tufts
by
shattered
stone
then
hid
below
some
broken
mass
of
ruins
older
than
the
east
that
time
had
eaten
as
a
bone
is
eaten
by
some
savage
beast
great
rattlesnakes
they
lay
all
loathsome
and
slept
coiled
tight
as
pine
knots
in
the
sun
with
flat
heads
through
the
centre
run
then
struck
out
sharp
then
rattling
crept
down
the
dusty
way
joaquin
miller
at
the
end
of
a
week
we
started
forth
for
ehrenberg
our
escort
was
now
sent
back
to
camp
apache
and
the
baileys
remained
at
fort
whipple
so
our
outfit
consisted
of
one
ambulance
and
one
army
wagon
one
or
two
soldiers
went
along
to
help
with
the
teams
and
the
camp
we
travelled
two
days
over
a
country
and
found
quite
comfortable
ranches
where
we
spent
the
nights
the
greatest
luxury
was
fresh
milk
and
we
enjoyed
that
at
these
ranches
in
skull
valley
they
kept
american
cows
and
supplied
whipple
barracks
with
milk
and
butter
we
drank
and
drank
and
drank
again
and
carried
a
jugful
to
our
bedside
the
third
day
brought
us
to
cullen
ranch
at
the
edge
of
the
desert
cullen
was
a
mexican
woman
and
had
a
little
boy
named
daniel
she
cooked
us
a
delicious
supper
of
stewed
chicken
and
fried
eggs
and
good
bread
and
then
she
put
our
boy
to
bed
in
daniel
crib
i
felt
so
grateful
to
her
and
with
a
return
of
physical
comfort
i
began
to
think
that
life
after
all
might
be
worth
the
living
hopefully
and
cheerfully
the
next
morning
we
entered
the
vast
colorado
desert
this
was
verily
the
desert
more
like
the
desert
which
our
imagination
pictures
than
the
one
we
had
crossed
in
september
from
mojave
it
seemed
so
white
so
bare
so
endless
and
so
still
irreclaimable
eternal
like
death
itself
the
stillness
was
appalling
we
saw
great
numbers
of
lizards
darting
about
like
lightning
they
were
nearly
as
white
as
the
sand
itself
and
sat
up
on
their
hind
legs
and
looked
at
us
with
their
pretty
beady
black
eyes
it
seemed
very
far
off
from
everywhere
and
everybody
this
desert
but
i
knew
there
was
a
camp
somewhere
awaiting
us
and
our
mules
trotted
patiently
on
towards
noon
they
began
to
raise
their
heads
and
sniff
the
air
they
knew
that
water
was
near
they
quickened
their
pace
and
we
soon
drew
up
before
a
large
wooden
structure
there
were
no
trees
nor
grass
around
it
a
mexican
worked
the
machinery
with
the
aid
of
a
mule
and
water
was
bought
for
our
twelve
animals
at
so
much
per
head
the
place
was
called
mesquite
wells
the
man
dwelt
alone
in
his
desolation
with
no
living
being
except
his
mule
for
company
how
could
he
endure
it
i
was
not
able
even
faintly
to
comprehend
it
i
had
not
lived
long
enough
he
occupied
a
small
hut
and
there
he
staid
year
in
and
year
out
selling
water
to
the
passing
traveller
and
i
fancy
that
travellers
were
not
so
frequent
at
mesquite
wells
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
the
thought
of
that
hermit
and
his
dreary
surroundings
filled
my
mind
for
a
long
time
after
we
drove
away
and
it
was
only
when
we
halted
and
a
soldier
got
down
to
kill
a
great
rattlesnake
near
the
ambulance
that
my
thoughts
were
diverted
the
man
brought
the
rattles
to
us
and
the
new
toy
served
to
amuse
my
little
son
at
night
we
arrived
at
desert
station
there
was
a
good
ranch
there
kept
by
hunt
and
dudley
englishmen
i
believe
i
did
not
see
them
but
i
wondered
who
they
were
and
why
they
staid
in
such
a
place
they
were
absent
at
the
time
perhaps
they
had
mines
or
something
of
the
sort
to
look
after
one
is
always
imagining
things
about
people
who
live
in
such
extraordinary
places
at
all
events
whatever
hunt
and
dudley
were
doing
down
there
their
ranch
was
clean
and
attractive
which
was
more
than
could
be
said
of
the
place
where
we
stopped
the
next
night
a
place
called
tyson
wells
we
slept
in
our
tent
that
night
for
of
all
places
on
the
earth
a
poorly
kept
ranch
in
arizona
is
the
most
melancholy
and
uninviting
it
reeks
of
everything
unclean
morally
and
physically
owen
wister
has
described
such
a
place
in
his
delightful
story
where
the
young
tenderfoot
dances
for
the
amusement
of
the
old
habitues
one
more
day
travel
across
the
desert
brought
us
to
our
el
dorado
chapter
xviii
ehrenberg
on
the
colorado
under
the
burning
sun
of
arizona
on
may
our
six
good
mules
with
the
long
whip
cracking
about
their
ears
and
the
ambulance
rattling
merrily
along
brought
us
into
the
village
of
ehrenberg
there
was
one
street
so
called
which
ran
along
on
the
river
bank
and
then
a
few
cross
streets
straggling
back
into
the
desert
with
here
and
there
a
low
adobe
casa
the
government
house
stood
not
far
from
the
river
and
as
we
drove
up
to
the
entrance
the
same
blank
white
walls
stared
at
me
it
did
not
look
so
much
like
a
prison
after
all
i
thought
captain
bernard
the
man
whom
i
had
pitied
stood
at
the
doorway
to
greet
us
and
after
we
were
inside
the
house
he
had
some
biscuits
and
wine
brought
and
then
the
change
of
stations
was
talked
of
and
he
said
to
me
now
please
make
yourself
at
home
the
house
is
yours
my
things
are
virtually
packed
up
and
i
leave
in
a
day
or
two
there
is
a
soldier
here
who
can
stay
with
you
he
has
been
able
to
attend
to
my
simple
wants
i
eat
only
twice
a
day
and
here
is
charley
my
indian
who
fetches
the
water
from
the
river
and
does
the
chores
i
dine
generally
at
sundown
a
shadow
fell
across
the
sunlight
in
the
doorway
i
looked
around
and
there
stood
charley
who
had
come
in
with
the
noiseless
step
of
the
moccasined
foot
i
saw
before
me
a
handsome
naked
cocopah
indian
who
wore
a
belt
and
a
he
seemed
to
feel
at
home
and
began
to
help
with
the
bags
and
various
paraphernalia
of
ambulance
travellers
he
looked
to
be
about
years
old
his
face
was
smiling
and
friendly
and
i
knew
i
should
like
him
the
house
was
a
adobe
it
formed
two
sides
of
a
hollow
square
the
other
two
sides
were
a
high
wall
and
the
government
respectively
the
courtyard
was
partly
shaded
by
a
ramada
and
partly
open
to
the
hot
sun
there
was
a
in
one
corner
of
the
inclosed
square
and
in
the
centre
stood
a
rickety
old
pump
which
indicated
some
sort
of
a
well
not
a
green
leaf
or
tree
or
blade
of
grass
in
sight
nothing
but
white
sand
as
far
as
one
could
see
in
all
directions
inside
the
house
there
were
bare
white
walls
ceilings
covered
with
manta
and
sagging
as
they
always
do
small
windows
set
in
deep
embrasures
and
adobe
floors
small
and
inconvenient
rooms
opening
one
into
another
around
two
sides
of
the
square
a
sort
of
low
veranda
protected
by
lattice
screens
made
from
a
species
of
slim
cactus
called
ocotilla
woven
together
and
bound
with
ran
around
a
part
of
the
house
our
dinner
was
enlivened
by
some
good
cocomonga
wine
i
tried
to
ascertain
something
about
the
source
of
provisions
but
evidently
the
soldier
had
done
the
foraging
and
captain
bernard
admitted
that
it
was
difficult
adding
always
that
he
did
not
require
much
it
was
so
warm
et
caetera
et
caetera
the
next
morning
i
took
the
reins
nominally
but
told
the
soldier
to
go
ahead
and
do
just
as
he
had
always
done
i
selected
a
small
room
for
the
baby
bath
the
all
important
function
of
the
day
the
indian
brought
me
a
large
tub
the
same
sort
of
a
half
of
a
vinegar
barrel
we
had
used
at
apache
for
ourselves
set
it
down
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
brought
water
from
a
barrel
which
stood
in
the
corral
a
low
box
was
placed
for
me
to
sit
on
this
was
a
bachelor
establishment
and
there
was
no
place
but
the
floor
to
lay
things
on
but
what
with
the
splashing
and
the
leaking
and
the
dripping
the
floor
turned
to
mud
and
the
white
clothes
and
towels
were
covered
with
it
and
i
myself
was
a
sight
to
behold
the
indian
stood
smiling
at
my
plight
he
spoke
only
a
pigeon
english
but
said
too
wet
i
was
in
despair
things
began
to
look
hopeless
again
to
me
i
thought
surely
these
mexicans
must
know
how
to
manage
with
these
floors
fisher
the
steamboat
agent
came
in
and
i
asked
him
if
he
could
not
find
me
a
nurse
he
said
he
would
try
and
went
out
to
see
what
could
be
done
he
finally
brought
in
a
rather
forlorn
looking
mexican
woman
leading
a
little
child
whose
father
was
not
known
and
she
said
she
would
come
to
us
for
quinze
pesos
a
month
i
consulted
with
fisher
and
he
said
she
was
a
pretty
good
sort
and
that
we
could
not
afford
to
be
too
particular
down
in
that
country
and
so
she
came
and
although
she
was
indolent
and
forever
smoking
cigarettes
she
did
care
for
the
baby
and
fanned
him
when
he
slept
and
proved
a
blessing
to
me
and
now
came
the
unpacking
of
our
boxes
which
had
floated
down
the
colorado
chiquito
the
fine
damask
brought
from
germany
for
my
linen
chest
was
a
mass
of
mildew
and
when
the
books
came
to
light
i
could
have
wept
to
see
the
pretty
editions
of
schiller
goethe
and
lessing
which
i
had
bought
in
hanover
fall
out
of
their
bindings
the
latter
warped
out
of
all
shape
and
some
of
them
unrecognizable
i
did
the
best
i
could
however
not
to
show
too
much
concern
and
gathered
the
pages
carefully
together
to
dry
them
in
the
sun
they
were
my
pride
my
best
beloved
possessions
the
links
that
bound
me
to
the
happy
days
in
old
hanover
i
went
to
fisher
for
everything
a
large
american
and
a
kind
good
man
fisher
could
not
endure
the
life
at
ehrenberg
so
she
lived
in
san
francisco
he
told
me
there
were
several
other
white
men
in
the
place
and
two
large
stores
where
everything
was
kept
that
people
in
such
countries
buy
these
merchants
made
enormous
profits
and
their
families
lived
in
luxury
in
san
francisco
the
rest
of
the
population
consisted
of
a
very
poor
class
of
mexicans
cocopah
yuma
and
mojave
indians
and
the
duties
of
the
army
officer
stationed
here
consisted
principally
in
receiving
and
shipping
the
enormous
quantity
of
government
freight
which
was
landed
by
the
river
steamers
it
was
shipped
by
wagon
trains
across
the
territory
and
at
all
times
the
work
carried
large
responsibilities
with
it
i
soon
realized
that
however
much
the
present
incumbent
might
like
the
situation
it
was
no
fit
place
for
a
woman
the
station
at
ehrenberg
was
what
we
call
in
the
army
detached
service
i
realized
that
we
had
left
the
army
for
the
time
being
that
we
had
cut
loose
from
a
garrison
that
we
were
in
a
place
where
good
food
could
not
be
procured
and
where
there
were
practically
no
servants
to
be
had
that
there
was
not
a
woman
to
speak
to
or
to
go
to
for
advice
or
help
and
worst
of
all
that
there
was
no
doctor
in
the
place
besides
all
this
my
clothes
were
all
ruined
by
lying
wet
for
a
fortnight
in
the
boxes
and
i
had
practically
nothing
to
wear
i
did
not
then
know
what
useless
things
clothes
were
in
ehrenberg
the
situation
appeared
rather
serious
the
weather
had
grown
intensely
hot
and
it
was
decided
that
the
only
thing
for
me
to
do
was
to
go
to
san
francisco
for
the
summer
so
one
day
we
heard
the
whistle
of
the
gila
going
up
and
when
she
came
down
river
i
was
all
ready
to
go
on
board
with
patrocina
and
jesusita
and
my
own
child
who
was
yet
but
five
months
old
i
bade
farewell
to
the
man
on
detached
service
and
we
headed
down
river
we
seemed
to
go
down
very
rapidly
although
the
trip
lasted
several
days
patrocina
took
to
her
bed
with
neuralgia
or
nostalgia
her
little
devil
of
a
child
screamed
the
entire
days
and
nights
through
to
the
utter
discomfiture
of
the
few
other
passengers
a
young
lieutenant
and
his
wife
and
an
army
surgeon
who
had
come
from
one
of
the
posts
in
the
interior
were
among
the
number
and
they
seemed
to
think
that
i
could
help
it
though
they
did
not
say
so
diminutive
of
jesus
a
very
common
name
amongst
the
mexicans
pronounced
finally
the
doctor
said
that
if
i
did
not
throw
jesusita
overboard
he
would
why
did
i
wring
the
neck
of
its
worthless
mexican
of
a
mother
and
so
on
until
i
really
grew
very
nervous
and
unhappy
thinking
what
i
should
do
after
we
got
on
board
the
ocean
steamer
i
a
victim
of
seasickness
with
this
unlucky
woman
and
her
child
on
my
hands
in
addition
to
my
own
no
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
back
to
ehrenberg
but
i
said
nothing
i
did
not
dare
to
let
doctor
clark
know
of
my
decision
for
i
knew
he
would
try
to
dissuade
me
but
when
we
reached
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
they
began
to
transfer
the
passengers
to
the
ocean
steamer
which
lay
in
the
offing
i
quietly
sat
down
upon
my
trunk
and
told
them
i
was
going
back
to
ehrenberg
captain
mellon
grinned
the
others
were
speechless
they
tried
persuasion
but
saw
it
was
useless
and
then
they
said
to
me
and
our
headed
about
and
started
for
up
river
ehrenberg
had
become
truly
my
old
man
of
the
sea
i
could
not
get
rid
of
it
there
i
must
go
and
there
i
must
stay
until
circumstances
and
the
fates
were
more
propitious
for
my
departure
chapter
xix
summer
at
ehrenberg
the
week
we
spent
going
up
the
colorado
in
june
was
not
as
uncomfortable
as
the
time
spent
on
the
river
in
august
of
the
previous
year
everything
is
relative
i
discovered
and
i
was
happy
in
going
back
to
stay
with
the
first
lieutenant
of
c
company
and
share
his
fortunes
awhile
longer
patrocina
recovered
as
soon
as
she
found
we
were
to
return
to
ehrenberg
i
wondered
how
anybody
could
be
so
homesick
for
such
a
place
i
asked
her
if
she
had
ever
seen
a
tree
or
green
grass
for
i
could
talk
with
her
quite
easily
now
she
shook
her
mournful
head
but
do
you
want
to
see
trees
and
grass
and
flowers
another
sad
shake
of
the
head
was
the
only
reply
such
people
such
natures
and
such
lives
were
incomprehensible
to
me
then
i
could
not
look
at
things
except
from
my
own
standpoint
she
took
her
child
upon
her
knee
and
lighted
a
cigarette
i
took
mine
upon
my
knee
and
gazed
at
the
river
banks
they
were
now
old
friends
i
had
gazed
at
them
many
times
before
how
much
i
had
experienced
and
how
much
had
happened
since
i
first
saw
them
could
it
be
that
i
should
ever
come
to
love
them
and
the
pungent
smell
of
the
which
covered
them
to
the
water
edge
the
huge
mosquitoes
swarmed
over
us
in
the
nights
from
those
thick
clumps
of
and
willow
and
the
nets
with
which
captain
mellon
provided
us
did
not
afford
much
protection
the
june
heat
was
bad
enough
though
not
quite
so
stifling
as
the
august
heat
i
was
becoming
accustomed
to
climates
and
had
learned
to
endure
discomfort
the
salt
beef
and
the
chinaman
peach
pies
were
no
longer
offensive
to
me
indeed
i
had
a
good
appetite
for
them
though
they
were
not
exactly
the
sort
of
food
prescribed
by
the
modern
doctor
for
a
young
mother
of
course
milk
eggs
and
all
fresh
food
were
not
to
be
had
on
the
river
boats
ice
was
still
a
thing
unknown
on
the
colorado
when
after
a
week
the
gila
pushed
her
nose
up
to
the
bank
at
ehrenberg
there
stood
the
quartermaster
he
jumped
aboard
and
did
not
seem
in
the
least
surprised
to
see
me
i
knew
you
come
back
said
he
i
laughed
of
course
and
we
both
laughed
i
had
the
courage
to
go
on
i
replied
oh
well
we
can
make
things
comfortable
here
and
get
through
the
summer
some
way
he
said
i
build
some
rooms
on
and
a
kitchen
and
we
can
surely
get
along
it
the
healthiest
place
in
the
world
for
children
they
tell
me
so
after
a
hearty
handshake
with
captain
mellon
who
had
taken
such
good
care
of
me
on
my
week
voyage
up
river
i
being
almost
the
only
passenger
i
put
my
foot
once
more
on
the
shores
of
old
ehrenberg
and
we
wended
our
way
towards
the
blank
white
walls
of
the
government
house
i
was
glad
to
be
back
and
content
to
wait
so
work
was
begun
immediately
on
the
kitchen
my
first
stipulation
was
that
the
new
rooms
were
to
have
wooden
floors
for
although
the
cocopah
charley
kept
the
adobe
floors
in
perfect
condition
by
sprinkling
them
down
and
sweeping
them
out
every
morning
they
were
quite
impossible
especially
where
it
concerned
white
dresses
and
children
and
the
little
sharp
rocks
in
them
seemed
to
be
so
tiring
to
the
feet
life
as
we
americans
live
it
was
difficult
in
ehrenberg
i
often
said
oh
if
we
could
only
live
as
the
mexicans
live
how
easy
it
would
be
for
they
had
their
fire
built
between
some
stones
piled
up
in
their
yard
a
piece
of
sheet
iron
laid
over
the
top
this
was
the
a
pot
of
coffee
was
made
in
the
morning
early
and
the
family
sat
on
the
low
porch
and
drank
it
and
ate
a
biscuit
then
a
kettle
of
frijoles
was
put
over
to
boil
these
were
boiled
slowly
for
some
hours
then
lard
and
salt
were
added
and
they
simmered
down
until
they
were
deliciously
fit
to
eat
and
had
a
thick
red
gravy
brown
bean
then
the
young
matron
or
daughter
of
the
house
would
mix
the
peculiar
paste
of
flour
and
salt
and
water
for
tortillas
a
species
of
unleavened
bread
these
tortillas
were
patted
out
until
they
were
as
large
as
a
dinner
plate
and
very
thin
then
thrown
onto
the
hot
where
they
baked
each
one
of
the
family
then
got
a
tortilla
the
spoonful
of
beans
was
laid
upon
it
and
so
they
managed
without
the
paraphernalia
of
silver
and
china
and
napery
how
i
envied
them
the
simplicity
of
their
lives
besides
the
tortillas
were
delicious
to
eat
and
as
for
the
frijoles
they
were
beyond
anything
i
had
ever
eaten
in
the
shape
of
beans
i
took
lessons
in
the
making
of
tortillas
a
woman
was
paid
to
come
and
teach
me
but
i
never
mastered
the
art
it
is
in
the
blood
of
the
mexican
and
a
girl
begins
at
a
very
early
age
to
make
the
tortilla
it
is
the
most
graceful
thing
to
see
a
pretty
mexican
toss
the
disc
over
her
bare
arm
and
pat
it
out
until
transparent
this
was
their
supper
for
like
nearly
all
people
in
the
tropics
they
ate
only
twice
a
day
their
fare
was
varied
sometimes
by
a
little
carni
seca
pounded
up
and
stewed
with
chile
verde
or
chile
colorado
now
if
you
could
hear
the
soft
exquisite
affectionate
drawl
with
which
the
mexican
woman
says
chile
verde
you
could
perhaps
come
to
realize
what
an
important
part
the
delicious
green
pepper
plays
in
the
cookery
of
these
countries
they
do
not
use
it
in
its
raw
state
but
generally
roast
it
whole
stripping
off
the
thin
skin
and
throwing
away
the
seeds
leaving
only
the
pulp
which
acquires
a
fine
flavor
by
having
been
roasted
or
toasted
over
the
hot
coals
the
women
were
scrupulously
clean
and
modest
and
always
wore
when
in
their
casa
a
and
white
linen
camisa
fitting
neatly
with
bands
around
neck
and
arms
over
this
they
wore
a
calico
skirt
always
white
stockings
and
black
slippers
when
they
ventured
out
the
younger
women
put
on
muslin
gowns
and
carried
parasols
the
older
women
wore
a
linen
towel
thrown
over
their
heads
or
in
cool
weather
the
black
riboso
i
often
cried
oh
if
i
could
only
dress
as
the
mexicans
do
their
necks
and
arms
do
look
so
cool
and
clean
i
have
always
been
sorry
i
did
not
adopt
their
fashion
of
house
apparel
instead
of
that
i
yielded
to
the
prejudices
of
my
conservative
partner
and
sweltered
during
the
day
in
and
white
dresses
kept
up
the
table
in
american
fashion
ate
american
food
in
so
far
as
we
could
get
it
and
all
at
the
expense
of
strength
for
our
soldier
cooks
who
were
loaned
us
by
captain
ernest
from
his
company
at
fort
yuma
were
constantly
being
changed
and
i
was
often
left
with
the
indian
and
the
indolent
patrocina
at
those
times
how
i
wished
i
had
no
silver
no
table
linen
no
china
and
could
revert
to
the
primitive
customs
of
my
neighbors
there
was
no
market
but
occasionally
a
mexican
killed
a
steer
and
we
bought
enough
for
one
meal
but
having
no
ice
and
no
place
away
from
the
terrific
heat
the
meat
was
hung
out
under
the
ramada
with
a
piece
of
netting
over
it
until
the
first
heat
had
passed
out
of
it
and
then
it
was
cooked
the
mexican
after
selling
what
meat
he
could
cut
the
rest
into
thin
strips
and
hung
it
up
on
ropes
to
dry
in
the
sun
it
dried
hard
and
brittle
in
its
natural
state
so
pure
is
the
air
on
that
wonderful
river
bank
they
called
this
carni
seca
and
the
americans
called
it
jerked
beef
patrocina
often
prepared
me
a
dish
of
this
when
i
was
unable
to
taste
the
fresh
meat
she
would
pound
it
fine
with
a
heavy
pestle
and
then
put
it
to
simmer
seasoning
it
with
the
green
or
red
pepper
it
was
most
savory
there
was
no
butter
at
all
during
the
hot
months
but
our
hens
laid
a
few
eggs
and
the
quartermaster
was
allowed
to
keep
a
small
lot
of
commissary
stores
from
which
we
drew
our
supplies
of
flour
ham
and
canned
things
we
were
often
without
milk
for
weeks
at
a
time
for
the
cows
crossed
the
river
to
graze
and
sometimes
could
not
get
back
until
the
river
fell
again
and
they
could
pick
their
way
back
across
the
shifting
sand
bars
the
indian
brought
the
water
every
morning
in
buckets
from
the
river
it
looked
like
melted
chocolate
he
filled
the
barrels
and
when
it
had
settled
clear
the
ollas
were
filled
and
thus
the
drinking
water
was
a
trifle
cooler
than
the
air
one
day
it
seemed
unusually
cool
so
i
said
let
us
see
by
the
thermometer
how
cool
the
water
really
is
we
found
the
temperature
of
the
water
to
be
degrees
but
that
with
the
air
at
in
the
shade
seemed
quite
refreshing
to
drink
i
did
not
see
any
white
people
at
all
except
fisher
abe
frank
the
mail
contractor
and
one
or
two
of
the
younger
merchants
if
i
wanted
anything
i
went
to
fisher
he
always
could
solve
the
difficulty
he
procured
for
me
an
excellent
laundress
who
came
and
brought
the
linen
herself
and
bowing
to
the
floor
said
always
buenos
dias
senorita
dwelling
on
the
latter
word
as
a
gentle
compliment
to
a
younger
woman
and
then
mucho
calor
este
dia
in
her
low
drawling
voice
like
the
others
she
was
spotlessly
clean
modest
and
gentle
i
asked
her
what
on
earth
they
did
about
bathing
for
i
had
found
the
tub
baths
with
the
muddy
water
so
disagreeable
she
told
me
the
women
bathed
in
the
river
at
daybreak
and
asked
me
if
i
would
like
to
go
with
them
i
was
only
too
glad
to
avail
myself
of
her
invitation
and
so
like
pharoah
daughter
of
old
i
went
with
my
gentle
handmaiden
every
morning
to
the
river
bank
and
wading
in
about
in
the
thick
red
waters
we
sat
down
and
let
the
swift
current
flow
by
us
we
dared
not
go
deeper
we
could
feel
the
round
stones
grinding
against
each
other
as
they
were
carried
down
and
we
were
all
afraid
it
was
difficult
to
keep
one
foothold
and
capt
mellon
words
were
ever
ringing
in
my
ears
he
who
disappears
below
the
surface
of
the
colorado
is
never
seen
again
but
we
joined
hands
and
ventured
like
children
and
played
like
children
in
these
red
waters
and
after
all
it
was
much
nicer
than
a
tub
of
muddy
water
indoors
a
clump
of
low
mesquite
trees
at
the
top
of
the
bank
afforded
sufficient
protection
at
that
hour
we
rubbed
dry
slipped
on
a
loose
gown
and
wended
our
way
home
what
a
contrast
to
the
limpid
bracing
salt
waters
of
my
own
beloved
shores
when
i
thought
of
them
i
was
seized
with
a
longing
which
consumed
me
and
made
my
heart
sick
and
i
thought
of
these
poor
people
who
had
never
known
anything
in
their
lives
but
those
desert
places
and
that
muddy
red
water
and
wondered
what
they
would
do
how
they
would
act
if
transported
into
some
beautiful
forest
or
to
the
cool
bright
shores
where
clear
blue
waters
invite
to
a
plunge
whenever
the
came
up
we
were
sure
to
have
guests
for
many
officers
went
into
the
territory
via
ehrenberg
sometimes
the
transportation
was
awaiting
them
at
other
times
they
were
obliged
to
wait
at
ehrenberg
until
it
arrived
they
usually
lived
on
the
boat
as
we
had
no
extra
rooms
but
i
generally
asked
them
to
luncheon
or
supper
for
anything
that
could
be
called
a
dinner
was
out
of
the
question
this
caused
me
some
anxiety
as
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
but
i
remembered
the
hospitality
i
had
received
and
thought
of
what
they
had
been
obliged
to
eat
on
the
voyage
and
i
always
asked
them
to
share
what
we
could
provide
however
simple
it
might
be
at
such
times
we
heard
all
the
news
from
washington
and
the
states
and
all
about
the
fashions
and
they
in
their
turn
asked
me
all
sorts
of
questions
about
ehrenberg
and
how
i
managed
to
endure
the
life
they
were
always
astonished
when
the
cocopah
indian
waited
on
them
at
table
for
he
wore
nothing
but
his
and
although
it
was
an
matter
to
us
it
rather
took
their
breath
away
but
charley
appealed
to
my
aesthetic
sense
in
every
way
tall
and
with
limbs
and
features
fine
smooth
skin
handsome
face
heavy
black
hair
done
up
in
pompadour
fashion
and
plastered
with
colorado
mud
which
was
baked
white
by
the
sun
a
small
feather
at
the
crown
of
his
head
wide
turquoise
bead
bracelets
upon
his
upper
arm
and
a
knife
at
his
waist
this
was
my
charley
my
cocopah
my
man
about
the
place
my
butler
in
fact
for
charley
understood
how
to
open
a
bottle
of
cocomonga
gracefully
and
to
keep
the
glasses
filled
charley
also
wheeled
the
baby
out
along
the
river
banks
for
we
had
had
a
fine
perambulator
sent
down
from
san
francisco
it
was
an
incongruous
sight
to
be
sure
and
one
must
laugh
to
think
of
it
the
ehrenberg
babies
did
not
have
carriages
and
the
village
flocked
to
see
it
there
sat
the
boy
with
but
one
linen
garment
on
no
cap
no
stockings
and
this
wild
man
of
the
desert
his
knife
gleaming
at
his
waist
and
his
floating
out
behind
wheeling
and
pushing
the
carriage
along
the
sandy
roads
but
this
came
to
an
end
for
one
day
fisher
rushed
in
breathless
and
said
well
here
is
your
baby
i
was
just
in
time
for
that
injun
of
yours
left
the
carriage
in
the
middle
of
the
street
to
look
in
at
the
store
window
and
a
herd
of
wild
cattle
came
tearing
down
i
grabbed
the
carriage
to
the
sidewalk
cussed
the
injun
out
and
here
the
child
it
no
use
he
added
you
ca
trust
those
injuns
out
of
sight
the
heat
was
terrific
our
cots
were
placed
in
the
open
part
of
the
corral
as
our
courtyard
was
always
called
it
was
a
place
on
one
side
the
high
adobe
wall
on
another
the
and
on
the
other
two
our
apartments
our
kitchen
and
the
two
other
rooms
were
now
completed
the
kitchen
had
no
windows
only
open
spaces
to
admit
the
air
and
light
and
we
were
often
startled
in
the
night
by
the
noise
of
thieves
in
the
house
rummaging
for
food
at
such
times
our
would
rush
into
the
corral
with
his
rifle
the
lieutenant
would
jump
up
and
seize
his
shotgun
which
always
stood
near
by
and
together
they
would
roam
through
the
house
but
the
thieving
indians
could
jump
out
of
the
windows
as
easily
as
they
jumped
in
and
the
excitement
would
soon
be
over
the
violent
which
prevail
in
those
deserts
sometimes
came
up
in
the
night
without
warning
then
we
rushed
half
suffocated
and
blinded
into
the
house
and
as
soon
as
we
had
closed
the
windows
it
had
passed
on
leaving
a
deep
layer
of
sand
on
everything
in
the
room
and
on
our
perspiring
bodies
then
came
the
work
next
day
for
the
indian
had
to
carry
everything
out
of
doors
and
one
storm
was
so
bad
that
he
had
to
use
a
shovel
to
remove
the
sand
from
the
floors
the
desert
literally
blew
into
the
house
and
now
we
saw
a
singular
phenomenon
in
the
late
afternoon
of
each
day
a
hot
steam
would
collect
over
the
face
of
the
river
then
slowly
rise
and
floating
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
wretched
hamlet
of
ehrenberg
descend
upon
and
envelop
us
thus
we
wilted
and
perspired
and
had
one
part
of
the
vapor
bath
without
its
bracing
concomitant
of
the
cool
shower
in
a
half
hour
it
was
gone
but
always
left
me
prostrate
then
jack
gave
me
milk
punch
if
milk
was
at
hand
or
sherry
and
egg
or
something
to
bring
me
up
to
normal
again
we
got
to
dread
the
steam
so
it
was
the
climax
of
the
long
hot
day
and
was
peculiar
to
that
part
of
the
river
the
paraphernalia
by
the
side
of
our
cots
at
night
consisted
of
a
pitcher
of
cold
tea
a
lantern
matches
a
revolver
and
a
shotgun
enormous
yellow
cats
which
lived
in
and
around
the
darted
to
and
fro
inside
and
outside
the
house
along
the
emitting
loud
cries
and
that
alone
was
enough
to
prevent
sleep
in
the
old
part
of
the
house
some
of
the
partitions
did
not
run
up
to
the
roof
but
were
left
open
for
ventilation
i
suppose
thus
making
a
fine
for
cats
and
rats
which
darted
along
squeaking
meowing
and
clattering
all
the
night
through
an
uncanny
feeling
of
insecurity
was
ever
with
me
what
with
the
accumulated
effect
of
the
day
heat
what
with
the
thieving
indians
the
and
the
cats
our
nights
by
no
means
gave
us
the
refreshment
needed
by
our
systems
by
the
latter
part
of
the
summer
i
was
so
exhausted
by
the
heat
and
the
various
difficulties
of
living
that
i
had
become
a
mere
shadow
of
my
former
self
men
and
children
seem
to
thrive
in
those
climates
but
it
is
death
to
women
as
i
had
often
heard
it
was
in
the
late
summer
that
the
boat
arrived
one
day
bringing
a
large
number
of
staff
officers
and
their
wives
head
clerks
and
general
service
men
for
fort
whipple
they
had
all
been
stationed
in
washington
for
a
number
of
years
having
had
what
is
known
in
the
army
as
details
i
threw
a
linen
towel
over
my
head
and
went
to
the
boat
to
call
on
them
and
remembering
my
voyage
from
san
francisco
the
year
before
prepared
to
sympathize
with
them
but
they
had
met
their
fate
with
resignation
knowing
they
should
find
a
good
climate
and
a
pleasant
post
up
in
the
mountains
and
as
they
had
no
young
children
with
them
they
were
disposed
to
make
merry
over
their
discomforts
we
asked
them
to
come
to
our
quarters
for
supper
and
to
come
early
as
any
place
was
cooler
than
the
boat
lying
down
there
in
the
melting
sun
and
nothing
to
look
upon
but
those
hot
decks
or
the
ragged
river
banks
with
their
uninviting
huts
scattered
along
the
edge
the
surroundings
somehow
did
not
fit
these
people
now
montgomery
at
camp
apache
seemed
to
have
adapted
herself
to
the
rude
setting
of
a
log
cabin
in
the
mountains
but
these
were
staff
people
and
they
had
enjoyed
for
years
the
civilized
side
of
army
life
now
they
were
determined
to
rough
it
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
begin
the
beautiful
wife
of
the
was
mourning
over
some
freckles
which
had
come
to
adorn
her
dazzling
complexion
and
she
had
put
on
a
large
hat
with
a
veil
was
there
ever
anything
so
incongruous
as
a
hat
and
veil
in
ehrenberg
for
a
long
time
i
had
not
seen
a
woman
in
a
hat
the
mexicans
all
wore
a
linen
towel
over
their
heads
but
her
beauty
was
startling
and
after
all
i
thought
a
woman
so
handsome
must
try
to
live
up
to
her
reputation
now
for
some
weeks
jack
had
been
investigating
the
sulphur
well
which
was
beneath
the
old
pump
in
our
corral
he
had
had
a
long
wooden
built
and
i
watched
it
with
a
lazy
interest
and
observed
his
glee
as
he
found
a
longshoreman
or
roustabout
who
could
caulk
it
the
shape
was
exactly
like
a
coffin
but
men
have
no
imaginations
and
when
i
told
him
how
it
made
me
feel
to
look
at
it
he
said
oh
you
are
always
thinking
of
gloomy
things
it
a
fine
tub
and
we
are
mighty
lucky
to
find
that
man
to
caulk
it
i
going
to
set
it
up
in
the
little
square
room
and
lead
the
sulphur
water
into
it
and
it
will
be
splendid
and
just
think
he
added
what
it
will
do
for
rheumatism
now
jack
had
served
in
the
twentieth
massachusetts
volunteers
during
the
civil
war
and
the
swamps
of
the
chickahominy
had
brought
him
into
close
acquaintance
with
that
dread
disease
as
for
myself
rheumatism
was
about
the
only
ailment
i
did
not
have
at
that
time
and
i
suppose
i
did
not
really
sympathize
with
him
but
this
energetic
and
indomitable
man
mended
the
pump
with
fisher
help
and
led
the
water
into
the
house
laid
a
floor
set
up
the
tub
in
the
little
square
room
and
behold
our
sulphur
bath
after
much
persuasion
i
tried
the
bath
the
water
flowed
thick
and
inky
black
into
the
tub
of
course
the
odor
was
beyond
description
and
the
effect
upon
me
was
not
such
that
i
was
ever
willing
to
try
it
again
jack
beamed
how
do
you
like
it
martha
said
he
is
it
fine
why
people
travel
hundreds
of
miles
to
get
a
bath
like
that
i
had
my
own
opinion
but
i
did
not
wish
to
dampen
his
enthusiasm
still
in
order
to
protect
myself
in
the
future
i
had
to
tell
him
i
thought
i
should
ordinarily
prefer
the
river
well
he
said
there
are
those
who
will
be
thankful
to
have
a
bath
in
that
water
i
am
going
to
use
it
every
day
i
remonstrated
how
do
you
know
what
is
in
that
inky
water
and
how
do
you
dare
to
use
it
oh
fisher
says
it
all
right
people
here
used
to
drink
it
years
ago
but
they
have
not
done
so
lately
because
the
pump
was
broken
down
the
washington
people
seemed
glad
to
pay
us
the
visit
jack
eyes
danced
with
true
generosity
and
glee
he
marked
his
victim
and
selecting
the
staff
beauty
and
the
paymaster
wife
he
expatiated
on
the
wonderful
properties
of
his
sulphur
bath
why
yes
the
sooner
the
better
said
martin
i
give
everything
i
have
in
this
world
and
all
my
chances
for
the
next
to
get
a
tub
bath
it
will
be
so
refreshing
just
before
supper
said
maynadier
who
was
more
conservative
so
the
indian
who
had
put
on
his
dark
blue
or
sash
made
from
flannel
revelled
out
and
twisted
into
strands
of
yarn
and
which
showed
the
supple
muscles
of
his
thighs
and
who
had
done
up
an
extra
high
pompadour
in
white
clay
and
burnished
his
knife
which
gleamed
at
his
waist
ushered
these
washington
women
into
a
small
apartment
adjoining
the
and
turned
on
the
inky
stream
into
the
sarcophagus
the
staff
beauty
looked
at
the
black
pool
and
shuddered
do
you
use
it
said
she
occasionally
i
equivocated
does
it
hurt
the
complexion
she
ventured
jack
thinks
it
excellent
for
that
i
replied
and
then
i
left
them
directing
charley
to
wait
and
prepare
the
bath
for
the
second
victim
by
and
by
the
beauty
came
out
where
is
your
mirror
cried
she
for
our
appointments
were
primitive
and
mirrors
did
not
grow
on
bushes
at
ehrenberg
i
fancy
i
look
queer
she
added
and
in
truth
she
did
for
our
water
of
the
styx
did
not
seem
to
affiliate
with
the
chemical
properties
of
the
numerous
cosmetics
used
by
her
more
or
less
all
her
life
but
especially
on
the
voyage
and
her
face
had
taken
on
a
queer
color
with
peculiar
spots
here
and
there
fortunately
my
mirrors
were
neither
large
nor
true
and
she
never
really
saw
how
she
looked
but
when
she
came
back
into
the
she
laughed
and
said
to
jack
what
kind
of
water
did
you
say
that
was
i
never
saw
any
just
like
it
oh
you
have
probably
never
been
much
to
the
sulphur
springs
said
he
with
his
most
superior
and
crushing
manner
perhaps
not
she
replied
but
i
thought
i
knew
something
about
it
why
my
entire
body
turned
such
a
queer
color
oh
it
always
does
that
said
this
optimistic
soldier
man
and
that
shows
it
is
doing
good
the
paymaster
wife
joined
us
later
i
think
she
had
profited
by
the
beauty
experience
for
she
said
but
little
the
quartermaster
was
happy
and
what
if
his
wife
did
not
believe
in
that
uncanny
stream
which
flowed
somewhere
from
out
the
infernal
regions
underlying
that
wretched
hamlet
he
had
succeeded
in
being
a
benefactor
to
two
travellers
at
least
we
had
a
merry
supper
cold
ham
chicken
and
fresh
biscuit
a
plenty
of
good
cocomonga
wine
sweet
milk
which
to
be
sure
turned
to
curds
as
it
stood
on
the
table
some
sort
of
preserves
from
a
tin
and
good
coffee
i
gave
them
the
best
to
be
had
in
the
desert
and
at
all
events
it
was
a
change
from
the
chinaman
salt
beef
and
peach
pies
and
they
saw
fresh
table
linen
and
shining
silver
and
accepted
our
simple
hospitality
in
the
spirit
in
which
we
gave
it
alice
martin
was
much
amused
over
charley
and
charley
could
do
nothing
but
gaze
on
her
lovely
features
why
on
earth
do
you
put
some
clothes
on
him
laughed
she
in
her
delightful
way
i
explained
to
her
that
the
indian
fashion
of
wearing
white
clothes
was
not
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
told
her
that
she
must
cultivate
her
aesthetic
sense
and
in
a
short
time
she
would
be
able
to
admire
these
creatures
of
nature
as
much
as
i
did
but
i
fear
that
a
life
spent
mostly
in
a
large
city
had
cast
fetters
around
her
imagination
and
that
the
life
at
fort
whipple
afterwards
savored
too
much
of
civilization
to
loosen
the
bonds
of
her
soul
i
saw
her
many
times
again
but
she
never
recovered
from
her
amazement
at
charley
lack
of
apparel
and
she
never
forgot
the
sulphur
bath
chapter
xx
my
deliverer
one
day
in
the
early
autumn
as
the
gila
touched
at
ehrenberg
on
her
way
down
river
captain
mellon
called
jack
on
to
the
boat
and
pointing
to
a
young
woman
who
was
about
to
go
ashore
said
now
there
a
girl
i
think
will
do
for
your
wife
she
imagines
she
has
bronchial
troubles
and
some
doctor
has
ordered
her
to
tucson
she
comes
from
up
north
somewhere
her
money
has
given
out
and
she
thinks
i
am
going
to
leave
her
here
of
course
you
know
i
would
not
do
that
i
can
take
her
on
down
to
yuma
but
i
thought
your
wife
might
like
to
have
her
so
told
her
she
could
not
travel
on
this
boat
any
farther
without
she
could
pay
her
fare
speak
to
her
she
looks
to
me
like
a
nice
sort
of
a
girl
in
the
meantime
the
young
woman
had
gone
ashore
and
was
sitting
upon
her
trunk
gazing
hopelessly
about
jack
approached
offered
her
a
home
and
good
wages
and
brought
her
to
me
i
could
have
hugged
her
for
very
joy
but
i
restrained
myself
and
advised
her
to
stay
with
us
for
awhile
saying
the
ehrenberg
climate
was
quite
as
good
as
that
of
tucson
she
remarked
quietly
you
do
not
look
as
if
it
agreed
with
you
very
well
then
i
told
her
of
my
young
child
and
my
hard
journeys
and
she
decided
to
stay
until
she
could
earn
enough
to
reach
tucson
and
so
ellen
became
a
member
of
our
ehrenberg
family
she
was
a
fine
strong
girl
and
a
very
good
cook
and
seemed
to
be
in
perfect
health
she
said
however
that
she
had
had
an
obstinate
cough
which
nothing
would
reach
and
that
was
why
she
came
to
arizona
from
that
time
things
went
more
smoothly
some
yeast
was
procured
from
the
mexican
bakeshop
and
ellen
baked
bread
and
other
things
which
seemed
like
the
greatest
luxuries
to
us
we
sent
the
soldier
back
to
his
company
at
fort
yuma
and
began
to
live
with
a
degree
of
comfort
i
looked
at
ellen
as
my
deliverer
and
regarded
her
coming
as
a
special
providence
the
kind
i
had
heard
about
all
my
life
in
new
england
but
had
never
much
believed
in
after
a
few
weeks
ellen
was
one
evening
seized
with
a
dreadful
toothache
which
grew
so
severe
that
she
declared
she
could
not
endure
it
another
hour
she
must
have
the
tooth
out
was
there
a
dentist
in
the
place
i
looked
at
jack
he
looked
at
me
ellen
groaned
with
pain
why
yes
of
course
there
is
said
this
man
for
emergencies
fisher
takes
out
teeth
he
told
me
so
the
other
day
now
i
did
not
believe
that
fisher
knew
any
more
about
extracting
teeth
than
i
did
myself
but
i
breathed
a
prayer
to
the
recording
angel
and
said
naught
i
go
get
fisher
said
jack
now
fisher
was
the
steamboat
agent
he
stood
six
feet
in
his
stockings
had
a
powerful
physique
and
a
determined
eye
men
in
those
countries
had
to
be
determined
for
if
they
once
lost
their
nerve
heaven
save
them
fisher
had
handsome
black
eyes
when
they
came
in
i
said
can
you
attend
to
this
business
mr
fisher
i
think
so
he
replied
quietly
the
quartermaster
says
he
has
some
forceps
i
gasped
jack
who
had
left
the
room
now
appeared
a
box
of
instruments
in
his
hand
his
eyes
shining
with
joy
and
triumph
fisher
took
the
box
and
scanned
it
i
guess
they
do
said
he
so
we
placed
ellen
in
a
chair
a
stiff
barrack
chair
with
a
seat
and
no
arms
it
was
evening
mattie
you
must
hold
the
candle
said
jack
i
hold
ellen
and
fisher
you
pull
the
tooth
so
i
lighted
the
candle
and
held
it
while
ellen
tried
by
its
flickering
light
to
show
fisher
the
tooth
that
ached
fisher
looked
again
at
the
box
of
instruments
why
said
he
these
are
lower
jaw
rollers
the
kind
used
a
hundred
years
ago
and
her
tooth
is
an
upper
jaw
never
mind
answered
the
lieutenant
the
instruments
are
all
right
fisher
you
can
get
the
tooth
out
that
all
you
want
is
it
the
lieutenant
was
impatient
and
besides
he
did
not
wish
any
slur
cast
upon
his
precious
instruments
so
fisher
took
up
the
forceps
and
clattered
around
amongst
sound
white
teeth
his
hand
shook
great
beads
of
perspiration
gathered
on
his
face
and
i
perceived
a
very
strong
odor
of
cocomonga
wine
he
had
evidently
braced
for
the
occasion
it
was
however
too
late
to
protest
he
fastened
onto
a
molar
and
with
the
lion
strength
which
lay
in
his
gigantic
frame
he
wrenched
it
out
ellen
put
up
her
hand
and
felt
the
place
my
god
you
pulled
the
wrong
tooth
cried
she
and
so
he
had
i
seized
a
jug
of
red
wine
which
stood
near
by
and
poured
out
a
gobletful
which
she
drank
the
blood
came
freely
from
her
mouth
and
i
feared
something
dreadful
had
happened
fisher
declared
she
had
shown
him
the
wrong
tooth
and
was
perfectly
willing
to
try
again
i
could
not
witness
the
second
attempt
so
i
put
the
candle
down
and
fled
the
and
confiding
girl
allowed
the
second
trial
and
between
the
steamboat
agent
the
lieutenant
and
the
red
wine
the
aching
molar
was
finally
extracted
this
was
a
serious
and
painful
occurrence
it
did
not
cause
any
of
us
to
laugh
at
the
time
i
am
sure
that
ellen
at
least
never
saw
the
comical
side
of
it
when
it
was
all
over
i
thanked
fisher
and
jack
beamed
upon
me
with
you
see
mattie
my
case
of
instruments
did
come
in
handy
after
all
encouraged
by
success
he
applied
for
a
pannier
of
medicines
and
the
ehrenberg
citizens
soon
regarded
him
as
a
healer
at
a
certain
hour
in
the
morning
the
sick
ones
came
to
his
office
and
he
dispensed
simple
drugs
to
them
and
was
enabled
to
do
much
good
he
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
intuitive
knowledge
about
medicines
and
performed
some
miraculous
cures
but
acquired
little
or
no
facility
in
the
use
of
the
language
i
was
often
called
in
as
interpreter
and
with
the
help
of
the
sign
language
and
the
little
i
knew
of
spanish
we
managed
to
get
an
idea
of
the
ailments
of
these
poor
people
and
so
our
life
flowed
on
in
that
desolate
spot
by
the
banks
of
the
great
colorado
i
rarely
went
outside
the
enclosure
except
for
my
bath
in
the
river
at
daylight
or
for
some
urgent
matter
the
one
street
along
the
river
was
hot
and
sandy
and
neglected
one
had
not
only
to
wade
through
the
sand
but
to
step
over
the
dried
heads
or
horns
or
bones
of
animals
left
there
to
whiten
where
they
died
or
thrown
out
possibly
when
some
one
killed
a
sheep
or
beef
nothing
decayed
there
but
dried
and
baked
hard
in
that
wonderful
air
and
sun
then
the
groups
of
indians
squaws
and
halfbreeds
loafing
around
the
village
and
the
store
one
never
felt
sure
what
one
was
to
meet
and
although
by
this
time
i
tolerated
about
everything
that
i
had
been
taught
to
think
wicked
or
immoral
still
in
ehrenberg
the
limit
was
reached
in
the
sights
i
saw
on
the
village
streets
too
bold
and
too
rude
to
be
described
in
these
pages
the
few
white
men
there
led
respectable
lives
enough
for
that
country
the
standard
was
not
high
and
when
i
thought
of
the
dreary
years
they
had
already
spent
there
without
their
families
and
the
years
they
must
look
forward
to
remaining
there
i
was
willing
to
reserve
my
judgement
chapter
xxi
winter
in
ehrenberg
we
asked
my
sister
penniman
to
come
out
and
spend
the
winter
with
us
and
to
bring
her
son
who
was
in
most
delicate
health
it
was
said
that
the
climate
of
ehrenberg
would
have
a
magical
effect
upon
all
diseases
of
the
lungs
or
throat
so
to
save
her
boy
my
sister
made
the
long
and
arduous
trip
out
from
new
england
arriving
in
ehrenberg
in
october
what
a
joy
to
see
her
and
to
initiate
her
into
the
ways
of
our
life
in
arizona
everything
was
new
everything
was
a
wonder
to
her
and
to
my
nephew
at
first
he
seemed
to
gain
perceptibly
and
we
had
great
hopes
of
his
recovery
it
was
now
cool
enough
to
sleep
indoors
and
we
began
to
know
what
it
was
to
have
a
good
night
rest
but
no
sooner
had
we
gotten
one
part
of
our
life
comfortably
arranged
before
another
part
seemed
to
fall
out
of
adjustment
accidents
and
climatic
conditions
kept
my
mind
in
a
perpetual
state
of
unrest
our
door
opened
through
two
small
rooms
into
the
kitchen
and
one
day
as
i
sat
at
the
table
waiting
for
jack
to
come
in
to
supper
i
heard
a
strange
sort
of
crashing
noise
looking
towards
the
kitchen
through
the
vista
of
open
doorways
i
saw
ellen
rush
to
the
door
which
led
to
the
courtyard
she
turned
a
livid
white
threw
up
her
hands
and
cried
great
god
the
captain
she
was
transfixed
with
horror
i
flew
to
the
door
and
saw
that
the
pump
had
collapsed
and
gone
down
into
the
deep
sulphur
well
in
a
second
jack
head
and
hands
appeared
at
the
edge
he
seemed
to
be
caught
in
the
debris
of
rotten
timber
before
i
could
get
to
him
he
had
scrambled
half
way
out
do
come
near
this
place
he
cried
it
all
caving
in
and
so
it
seemed
for
as
he
worked
himself
up
and
out
the
entire
structure
feel
in
and
half
the
corral
with
it
as
it
looked
to
me
jack
escaped
what
might
have
been
an
unlucky
bath
in
his
sulphur
well
and
we
all
recovered
our
composure
as
best
we
could
surely
if
life
was
dull
at
ehrenberg
it
could
not
be
called
exactly
monotonous
we
were
not
obliged
to
seek
our
excitement
outside
we
had
plenty
of
it
such
as
it
was
within
our
walls
my
confidence
in
ehrenberg
however
as
a
salubrious
was
being
gradually
and
literally
undermined
i
began
to
be
distrustful
of
the
very
ground
beneath
my
feet
ellen
felt
the
same
way
evidently
although
we
did
not
talk
much
about
it
she
probably
longed
also
for
some
of
her
own
kind
and
when
one
morning
we
went
into
the
for
breakfast
ellen
stood
hat
on
bag
in
hand
at
the
door
dreading
to
meet
my
chagrin
she
said
captain
missis
you
been
very
kind
to
me
i
leaving
on
the
stage
for
tucson
where
i
first
started
for
you
know
and
she
tripped
out
and
climbed
up
into
the
dusty
rickety
vehicle
called
the
stage
i
had
felt
so
safe
about
ellen
as
i
did
not
know
that
any
stage
line
ran
through
the
place
and
now
i
was
in
a
fine
plight
i
took
a
sunshade
and
ran
over
to
fisher
house
fisher
what
shall
i
do
ellen
has
gone
to
tucson
fisher
bethought
himself
and
we
went
out
together
in
the
village
not
a
woman
to
be
found
who
would
come
to
cook
for
us
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
the
quartermaster
was
allowed
a
soldier
to
assist
in
the
government
work
i
asked
him
if
he
understood
cooking
he
said
he
had
never
done
any
but
he
would
try
if
i
would
show
him
how
this
proved
a
hopeless
task
and
i
finally
gave
it
up
jack
dispatched
an
indian
runner
to
fort
yuma
ninety
miles
or
more
down
river
begging
captain
ernest
to
send
us
a
on
the
next
boat
this
was
a
long
time
to
wait
the
inconveniences
were
intolerable
there
were
our
four
selves
patrocina
and
jesusita
the
and
the
indian
to
be
provided
for
patrocina
prepared
carni
seca
with
peppers
a
little
boy
came
around
with
cuajada
a
delicious
sweet
curd
cheese
and
i
tried
my
hand
at
bread
following
out
ellen
instructions
how
often
i
said
to
my
husband
if
we
must
live
in
this
wretched
place
let
give
up
civilization
and
live
as
the
mexicans
do
they
are
the
only
happy
beings
around
here
look
at
them
as
you
pass
along
the
street
at
nearly
any
hour
in
the
day
you
can
see
them
sitting
under
their
ramada
their
backs
propped
against
the
wall
of
their
casa
calmly
smoking
cigarettes
and
gazing
at
nothing
with
a
look
of
ineffable
contentment
upon
their
features
they
surely
have
solved
the
problem
of
life
but
we
seemed
never
to
be
able
to
free
ourselves
from
the
fetters
of
civilization
and
so
i
struggled
on
one
evening
after
dusk
i
went
into
the
kitchen
opened
the
kitchen
closet
door
to
take
out
some
dish
when
clatter
bang
down
fell
the
and
a
shower
of
other
tin
ware
and
before
i
could
fairly
get
my
breath
out
jumped
two
young
squaws
and
without
deigning
to
glance
at
me
they
darted
across
the
kitchen
and
leaped
out
the
window
like
two
frightened
fawn
they
had
on
nothing
but
their
birthday
clothes
and
as
i
was
somewhat
startled
at
the
sight
of
them
i
stood
transfixed
my
eyes
gazing
at
the
open
space
through
which
they
had
flown
charley
the
indian
was
in
the
corral
filling
the
ollas
and
hearing
the
commotion
came
in
and
saw
just
the
disappearing
heels
of
the
two
squaws
i
said
very
sternly
charley
how
came
those
squaws
in
my
closet
he
looked
very
much
ashamed
and
said
oh
me
tell
you
bad
man
go
to
kill
i
hide
well
said
i
do
not
hide
any
more
girls
in
this
casa
you
savez
that
he
bowed
his
head
in
acquiescence
i
afterwards
learned
that
one
of
the
girls
was
his
sister
the
weather
was
now
fairly
comfortable
and
in
the
evenings
we
sat
under
the
ramada
in
front
of
the
house
and
watched
the
beautiful
pink
glow
which
spread
over
the
entire
heavens
and
illuminated
the
distant
mountains
of
lower
california
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
that
wonderful
color
which
spread
itself
over
sky
river
and
desert
for
an
hour
one
could
have
believed
oneself
in
a
magician
realm
at
about
this
time
the
patrocina
found
it
expedient
to
withdraw
into
the
green
valleys
of
lower
california
to
recuperate
for
a
few
months
with
the
impish
jesusita
in
her
arms
she
bade
me
a
mournful
worthless
as
she
was
from
the
standpoint
of
civilized
morals
i
was
attached
to
her
and
felt
sorry
to
part
with
her
then
i
took
a
mexican
woman
from
chihuahua
now
the
chihuahuans
hold
their
heads
high
and
it
was
rather
with
awe
that
i
greeted
the
tall
chihuahuan
lady
who
came
to
be
our
little
son
nurse
her
name
was
angela
angel
of
light
i
thought
how
fortunate
i
am
to
get
her
after
a
few
weeks
fisher
observed
that
the
whole
village
was
eating
ferris
ham
an
unusual
delicacy
in
ehrenberg
and
that
the
had
sold
none
so
he
suggested
that
our
commissary
storehouse
be
looked
to
and
it
was
found
that
a
dozen
hams
or
so
had
been
withdrawn
from
their
canvas
covers
the
covers
stuffed
with
straw
and
hung
back
in
place
verily
the
chihuahuan
was
adding
to
her
in
a
most
unworthy
fashion
and
she
had
to
go
after
that
i
was
left
without
a
nurse
my
little
son
was
now
about
nine
months
old
milk
began
to
be
more
plentiful
at
this
season
and
with
my
advice
and
help
i
decided
to
make
the
one
great
change
in
a
baby
life
to
take
him
from
his
mother
modern
methods
were
unknown
then
and
we
had
neither
of
us
any
experience
in
these
matters
and
there
was
no
doctor
in
the
place
the
result
was
that
both
the
baby
and
myself
were
painfully
and
desperately
ill
and
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
for
aid
when
by
a
lucky
turn
of
fortune
wheel
our
good
dear
doctor
henry
lippincott
came
through
ehrenberg
on
his
way
out
to
the
states
once
more
he
took
care
of
us
and
it
is
to
him
that
i
believe
i
owe
my
life
captain
ernest
sent
us
a
cook
from
yuma
and
soon
some
officers
came
for
the
there
were
thousands
of
ducks
around
the
various
lagoons
in
the
neighborhood
and
the
sport
was
rare
we
had
all
the
ducks
we
could
eat
then
came
an
earthquake
which
tore
and
rent
the
baked
earth
apart
the
ground
shivered
the
windows
rattled
the
birds
fell
close
to
the
ground
and
could
not
fly
the
fell
to
the
floor
the
thick
walls
cracked
and
finally
the
earth
rocked
to
and
fro
like
some
huge
thing
trying
to
get
its
balance
it
was
in
the
afternoon
my
sister
and
i
were
sitting
with
our
in
the
little
harry
was
on
the
floor
occupied
with
some
toys
i
was
paralyzed
with
fear
my
sister
did
not
move
we
sat
gazing
at
each
other
scarce
daring
to
breathe
expecting
every
instant
the
heavy
walls
to
crumble
about
our
heads
the
earth
rocked
and
rocked
and
rocked
again
then
swayed
and
swayed
and
finally
was
still
my
sister
caught
harry
in
her
arms
and
then
jack
and
willie
came
breathlessly
in
did
you
feel
it
said
jack
did
we
feel
it
said
i
scornfully
sarah
was
silent
and
i
looked
so
reproachfully
at
jack
that
he
dropped
his
light
tone
and
said
it
was
pretty
awful
we
were
in
the
goldwaters
store
when
suddenly
it
grew
dark
and
the
lamps
above
our
heads
began
to
rattle
and
swing
and
we
all
rushed
out
into
the
middle
of
the
street
and
stood
rather
dazed
for
we
scarcely
knew
what
had
happened
then
we
hurried
home
but
it
all
over
now
i
do
not
believe
it
said
i
we
shall
have
more
and
in
fact
we
did
have
two
light
shocks
in
the
night
but
no
more
followed
and
the
next
morning
we
recovered
in
a
measure
from
our
fright
and
went
out
to
see
the
great
fissures
in
that
treacherous
crust
of
earth
upon
which
ehrenberg
was
built
i
grew
afraid
after
that
and
the
idea
that
the
earth
would
eventually
open
and
engulf
us
all
took
possession
of
my
mind
my
health
already
weakened
by
shocks
and
severe
strains
gave
way
entirely
i
who
had
gloried
in
the
most
perfect
health
and
had
a
constitution
of
iron
became
an
emaciated
invalid
from
my
window
one
evening
at
sundown
i
saw
a
weird
procession
moving
slowly
along
towards
the
outskirts
of
the
village
it
must
be
a
funeral
thought
i
and
it
flashed
across
my
mind
that
i
had
never
seen
the
a
man
with
a
rude
cross
led
the
procession
then
came
some
mexicans
with
violins
and
guitars
after
the
musicians
came
the
body
of
the
deceased
wrapped
in
a
white
cloth
borne
on
a
bier
by
friends
and
followed
by
the
little
band
of
weeping
women
with
black
ribosos
folded
about
their
heads
they
did
not
use
coffins
at
ehrenberg
because
they
had
none
i
suppose
the
next
day
i
asked
jack
to
walk
to
the
with
me
he
postponed
it
from
day
to
day
but
i
insisted
upon
going
at
last
he
took
me
to
see
it
there
was
no
enclosure
but
the
bare
sloping
sandy
place
was
sprinkled
with
graves
marked
by
heaps
of
stones
and
in
some
instances
by
rude
crosses
of
wood
some
of
which
had
been
wrenched
from
their
upright
position
by
the
fierce
there
was
not
a
blade
of
grass
a
tree
or
a
flower
i
walked
about
among
these
graves
and
close
beside
some
of
them
i
saw
deep
holes
and
whitnened
bones
i
was
quite
ignorant
or
unthinking
and
asked
what
the
holes
were
it
is
where
the
coyotes
and
wolves
come
in
the
nights
said
jack
my
heart
sickened
as
i
thought
of
these
horrors
and
i
wondered
if
ehrenberg
held
anything
in
store
for
me
worse
than
what
i
had
already
seen
we
turned
away
from
this
unhallowed
and
walked
to
our
quarters
i
had
never
known
much
about
nerves
but
i
began
to
see
spectres
in
the
night
and
those
ghastly
graves
with
their
were
ever
before
me
the
place
was
but
a
stone
throw
from
us
and
the
uneasy
spirits
from
these
desecrated
graves
began
to
haunt
me
i
could
not
sit
alone
on
the
porch
at
night
for
they
peered
through
the
lattice
and
mocked
at
me
and
beckoned
some
had
no
heads
some
no
arms
but
they
pointed
or
nodded
towards
the
grewsome
you
be
with
us
soon
you
be
with
us
soon
chapter
xxii
return
to
the
states
i
dream
of
the
east
wind
tonic
of
the
breakers
stormy
roar
and
the
peace
of
the
inner
harbor
with
the
long
low
shimmo
shore
i
long
for
the
tolling
when
the
north
wind
brings
from
afar
the
smooth
green
shining
billows
to
be
churned
into
foam
on
the
bar
oh
for
the
screaming
as
they
swoop
so
bold
and
free
oh
for
the
fragrant
commons
and
the
glorious
open
sea
for
the
restful
great
contentment
for
the
joy
that
is
never
known
till
past
the
jetty
and
brant
point
light
the
islander
comes
to
his
own
mary
starbuck
i
must
send
you
out
i
see
that
you
can
not
stand
it
here
another
month
said
jack
one
day
and
so
he
bundled
us
onto
the
boat
in
the
early
spring
and
took
us
down
the
river
to
meet
the
ocean
steamer
there
was
no
question
about
it
this
time
and
i
well
knew
it
i
left
my
sister
and
her
son
in
ehrenberg
and
i
never
saw
my
nephew
again
a
month
later
his
state
of
health
became
so
alarming
that
my
sister
took
him
to
san
francisco
he
survived
the
long
voyage
but
died
there
a
few
weeks
later
at
the
home
of
my
cousin
at
fort
yuma
we
telegraphed
all
over
the
country
for
a
nurse
but
no
money
would
tempt
those
mexican
women
to
face
an
ocean
voyage
jack
put
me
on
board
the
old
newbern
in
charge
of
the
captain
waited
to
see
our
vessel
under
way
then
waved
from
the
deck
of
the
gila
and
turned
his
face
towards
his
post
and
duty
i
met
the
situation
as
best
i
could
and
as
i
have
already
described
a
voyage
on
this
old
craft
i
shall
not
again
enter
into
details
there
was
no
stewardess
on
board
and
all
arrangements
were
of
the
crudest
description
both
my
child
and
i
were
seasick
all
the
way
and
the
voyage
lasted
sixteen
days
our
misery
was
very
great
the
passengers
were
few
in
number
only
a
couple
of
mexican
miners
who
had
been
prospecting
an
irritable
old
mexican
woman
and
a
german
doctor
who
was
agreeable
but
elusive
the
old
mexican
woman
sat
on
the
deck
all
day
with
her
back
against
the
stateroom
door
she
was
a
picturesque
and
indolent
figure
there
was
no
diversion
no
variety
my
little
boy
required
constant
care
and
watching
the
days
seemed
endless
everbody
bought
great
bunches
of
green
bananas
at
the
ports
in
mexico
where
we
stopped
for
passengers
the
old
woman
was
irritable
and
one
day
when
she
saw
the
agreeable
german
doctor
pulling
bananas
from
the
bunch
which
she
had
hung
in
the
sun
to
ripen
she
got
up
muttering
carramba
and
shaking
her
fist
in
his
face
he
appeased
her
wrath
by
offering
her
in
the
most
fluent
spanish
some
from
his
own
bunch
when
they
should
be
ripe
such
were
my
surroundings
on
the
old
newbern
the
german
doctor
was
interesting
and
i
loved
to
talk
with
him
on
days
when
i
was
not
seasick
and
to
read
the
letters
which
he
had
received
from
his
family
who
were
living
on
their
rittergut
or
landed
estates
in
prussia
he
amused
me
by
tales
of
his
life
at
a
wretched
little
mining
village
somewhere
about
fifty
miles
from
ehrenberg
and
i
was
always
wondering
how
he
came
to
have
lived
there
he
had
the
keenest
sense
of
humor
and
as
i
listened
to
the
tales
of
his
adventures
and
miraculous
escapes
from
death
at
the
hands
of
these
desperate
folk
i
looked
in
his
large
laughing
blue
eyes
and
tried
to
solve
the
mystery
for
that
he
was
of
noble
birth
and
of
ancient
family
there
was
no
doubt
there
were
the
letters
there
was
the
crest
and
here
was
the
offshoot
of
the
family
i
made
up
my
mind
that
he
was
a
and
a
rolling
stone
he
was
elusive
and
beyond
his
adventures
told
me
nothing
of
himself
it
was
some
time
after
my
arrival
in
san
francisco
that
i
learned
more
about
him
now
after
we
rounded
cape
lucas
we
were
caught
in
the
long
heavy
swell
of
the
pacific
ocean
and
it
was
only
at
intervals
that
my
little
boy
and
i
could
leave
our
stateroom
the
doctor
often
held
him
while
i
ran
below
to
get
something
to
eat
and
i
can
never
forget
his
kindness
and
if
as
i
afterward
heard
in
san
francisco
he
really
had
entered
the
gate
of
a
hundred
sorrows
it
would
perhaps
best
explain
his
elusiveness
his
general
condition
and
his
sometimes
dazed
expression
a
gentle
and
kindly
spirit
met
by
chance
known
through
the
propinquity
of
a
sixteen
days
voyage
and
never
forgotten
everything
comes
to
an
end
however
interminable
it
may
seem
and
at
last
the
sharp
and
jagged
outlines
of
the
coast
began
to
grow
softer
and
we
approached
the
golden
gate
the
old
newbern
with
nothing
in
her
but
ballast
rolled
and
lurched
along
through
the
bright
green
waters
of
the
outer
bar
i
stood
leaning
against
the
great
mast
steadying
myself
as
best
i
could
and
the
tears
rolled
down
my
face
for
i
saw
the
friendly
green
hills
and
before
me
lay
the
glorious
bay
of
san
francisco
i
had
left
behind
me
the
deserts
the
black
rocks
the
burning
sun
the
snakes
the
scorpions
the
centipedes
the
indians
and
the
ehrenberg
graveyard
and
so
the
tears
flowed
and
i
did
not
try
to
stop
them
they
were
tears
of
joy
the
custom
officers
wanted
to
confiscate
the
great
bundles
of
mexican
cigarettes
they
found
in
my
trunk
but
no
i
told
them
they
were
for
my
own
use
they
raised
their
eyebrows
gave
me
one
look
and
put
them
back
into
the
trunk
my
beloved
california
relatives
met
us
and
took
care
of
us
for
a
fortnight
and
when
i
entered
a
pullman
car
for
a
nine
days
journey
to
my
old
home
it
seemed
like
the
most
luxurious
comfort
although
i
had
a
child
in
my
arms
and
no
nurse
so
does
everything
in
this
life
go
by
comparison
arriving
in
boston
my
sister
harriet
met
me
at
the
train
and
as
she
took
little
harry
from
my
arms
she
cried
where
did
you
get
that
sunbonnet
now
the
baby
ca
wear
that
in
boston
of
course
we
were
both
thinking
hard
of
all
that
had
happened
to
me
since
we
parted
on
the
morning
after
my
wedding
two
years
before
and
we
were
so
overcome
with
the
joy
of
meeting
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
baby
white
sunbonnet
i
do
not
know
what
kind
of
a
scene
we
might
have
made
that
saved
the
situation
and
after
a
few
days
of
rest
and
necessary
shopping
we
started
for
our
old
home
in
nantucket
such
a
welcome
as
the
baby
and
i
had
from
my
mother
and
father
and
all
old
friends
but
i
saw
sadness
in
their
faces
and
i
heard
it
in
their
voices
for
no
one
thought
i
could
possibly
live
i
felt
however
sure
it
was
not
too
late
i
knew
the
east
wind
tonic
would
not
fail
me
its
own
child
stories
of
our
experiences
and
misfortunes
were
eagerly
listened
to
by
the
family
and
betwixt
sighs
and
laughter
they
declared
they
were
going
to
fill
some
boxes
which
should
contain
everything
necessary
for
comfort
in
those
distant
places
so
one
room
in
our
old
house
was
set
apart
for
this
great
boxes
were
brought
and
day
by
day
various
articles
useful
ornamental
and
comfortable
and
precious
heirlooms
of
silver
and
glass
were
packed
away
in
them
it
was
the
year
of
the
year
of
the
great
centennial
at
philadelphia
everybody
went
but
it
had
no
attractions
for
me
i
was
happy
enough
enjoying
the
air
and
the
comforts
of
an
eastern
home
i
wondered
that
i
had
ever
complained
about
anything
there
or
wished
to
leave
that
blissful
spot
the
poorest
person
in
that
place
by
the
sea
had
more
to
be
thankful
for
in
my
opinion
than
the
richest
people
in
arizona
i
felt
as
if
i
must
cry
it
out
from
the
my
heart
was
thankful
every
minute
of
the
day
and
night
for
every
breath
of
soft
air
that
i
breathed
for
every
bit
of
fresh
fish
that
i
ate
for
fresh
vegetables
and
for
butter
for
gardens
for
trees
for
flowers
for
the
good
firm
earth
beneath
my
feet
i
wrote
the
man
on
detached
service
that
i
should
never
return
to
ehrenberg
after
eight
months
in
which
my
health
was
wholly
restored
i
heard
the
good
news
that
captain
corliss
had
applied
for
his
first
lieutenant
and
i
decided
to
join
him
at
once
at
camp
macdowell
although
i
had
not
wholly
forgotten
that
camp
macdowell
had
been
called
by
very
bad
names
during
our
stay
at
fort
whipple
at
the
time
that
jack
decided
on
the
ehrenberg
detail
i
determined
to
brave
it
in
all
its
unattractiveness
isolation
and
heat
for
i
knew
there
was
a
garrison
and
a
doctor
there
and
a
few
officers
families
i
knew
supplies
were
to
be
obtained
and
the
ordinary
comforts
of
a
post
then
too
in
my
summer
in
the
east
i
had
discovered
that
i
was
really
a
wife
and
i
must
go
back
to
it
all
to
the
army
with
its
glitter
and
its
misery
to
the
post
with
its
discomforts
to
the
soldiers
to
the
drills
to
the
to
the
monotony
to
the
heat
of
southern
arizona
to
the
uniform
and
the
stalwart
captains
and
gay
lieutenants
who
wore
it
i
felt
the
call
and
i
must
go
chapter
xxiii
back
to
arizona
the
last
nails
were
driven
in
the
precious
boxes
and
i
started
overland
in
november
with
my
little
son
now
nearly
two
years
old
overland
in
those
days
meant
nine
days
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
arriving
in
chicago
i
found
it
impossible
to
secure
a
section
on
the
pullman
car
so
was
obliged
to
content
myself
with
a
lower
berth
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
be
disappointed
on
entering
the
section
i
saw
an
enormous
pair
of
queer
cow
hide
shoes
the
very
queerest
shoes
i
had
ever
seen
lying
on
the
floor
with
a
much
used
travelling
bag
i
speculated
a
good
deal
on
the
shoes
but
did
not
see
the
owner
of
them
until
several
hours
later
when
a
short
german
with
sandy
beard
entered
and
saluted
me
politely
you
are
noticing
my
shoes
perhaps
madame
yes
i
said
involuntarily
answering
him
in
german
his
face
shone
with
pleasure
and
he
explained
to
me
that
they
were
made
in
russia
and
he
always
wore
them
when
travelling
what
have
we
i
thought
an
anarchist
but
with
the
inexperience
and
fearlessness
of
youth
i
entered
into
a
most
delightful
conversation
in
german
with
him
i
found
him
rather
an
extraordinarily
well
educated
gentleman
and
he
said
he
lived
in
nevada
but
had
been
over
to
vienna
to
place
his
little
boy
at
a
military
school
as
he
said
there
is
nothing
like
a
uniform
to
give
a
boy
he
said
his
wife
had
died
several
months
before
i
congratulated
myself
that
the
occupant
of
the
upper
berth
was
at
least
a
gentleman
the
next
day
as
we
sat
opposite
each
other
chatting
always
in
german
he
paused
and
fixing
his
eyes
rather
steadily
upon
me
he
remarked
do
you
think
i
put
on
mourning
when
my
wife
died
no
indeed
i
put
on
white
kid
gloves
and
had
a
fiddler
and
danced
at
the
grave
all
this
mourning
that
people
have
is
utter
nonsense
i
was
amazed
at
the
turn
his
conversation
had
taken
and
sat
quite
still
not
knowing
just
what
to
say
or
to
do
after
awhile
he
looked
at
me
steadily
and
said
very
deferentially
madame
the
spirit
of
my
dead
wife
is
looking
at
me
from
out
your
eyes
by
this
time
i
realized
that
the
man
was
a
maniac
and
i
had
always
heard
that
one
must
agree
with
crazy
people
so
i
nodded
and
that
seemed
to
satisfy
him
and
bye
and
bye
after
some
minutes
which
seemed
like
hours
to
me
he
went
off
to
the
smoking
room
the
tension
was
broken
and
i
appealed
to
a
very
nice
looking
woman
who
happened
to
be
going
to
some
place
in
nevada
near
which
this
doctor
lived
and
she
said
when
i
told
her
his
name
why
yes
i
heard
of
him
before
i
left
home
he
lives
in
silver
city
and
at
the
death
of
his
wife
he
went
hopelessly
insane
but
she
added
he
is
harmless
i
believe
this
was
a
nice
fix
to
be
sure
and
i
staid
over
in
her
section
all
day
and
late
that
night
the
doctor
arrived
at
the
junction
where
he
was
to
take
another
train
so
i
slept
in
peace
after
a
considerable
agitation
there
is
nothing
like
experience
to
teach
a
young
woman
how
to
travel
alone
in
san
francisco
i
learned
that
i
could
now
go
as
far
as
los
angeles
by
rail
thence
by
steamer
to
san
diego
and
so
on
by
stage
to
fort
yuma
where
my
husband
was
to
meet
me
with
an
ambulance
and
a
wagon
i
was
enchanted
with
the
idea
of
avoiding
the
long
down
the
pacific
coast
but
sent
my
boxes
down
by
the
steamer
montana
sister
ship
of
the
old
newbern
and
after
a
few
days
rest
in
san
francisco
set
forth
by
rail
for
los
angeles
at
san
pedro
the
port
of
los
angeles
we
embarked
for
san
diego
it
was
a
heavenly
night
i
sat
on
deck
enjoying
the
calm
sea
and
listening
to
the
romantic
story
of
lieutenant
philip
reade
then
stationed
at
san
diego
he
was
telling
the
story
himself
and
i
had
never
read
or
heard
of
anything
so
mysterious
or
so
tragic
then
too
aside
from
the
story
reade
was
a
very
and
chivalrous
young
army
officer
he
was
returning
to
his
station
in
san
diego
and
we
had
this
pleasant
opportunity
to
renew
what
had
been
a
very
slight
acquaintance
the
calm
waters
of
the
pacific
with
their
long
and
gentle
swell
the
pale
light
of
the
full
moon
our
steamer
gliding
so
quietly
along
the
soft
air
of
the
california
coast
the
absence
of
noisy
travellers
these
made
a
fit
setting
for
the
story
of
his
early
love
and
marriage
and
the
tragic
mystery
which
surrounded
the
death
of
his
young
bride
all
the
romance
which
lived
and
will
ever
live
in
me
was
awake
to
the
story
and
the
hours
passed
all
too
quickly
but
a
cry
from
my
little
boy
in
the
deck
stateroom
recalled
me
to
the
realities
of
life
and
i
said
having
spent
one
of
the
most
delightful
evenings
i
ever
remember
reade
wears
now
a
star
on
his
shoulder
and
well
earned
it
is
too
i
wonder
if
he
has
forgotten
how
he
helped
to
bind
up
my
little
finger
which
had
been
broken
in
an
accident
on
the
train
from
san
francisco
to
los
angeles
or
how
he
procured
a
surgeon
for
me
on
our
arrival
there
and
got
a
comfortable
room
for
us
at
the
hotel
or
how
he
took
us
to
drive
with
an
older
lady
for
a
chaperon
or
how
he
kindly
cared
for
us
until
we
were
safely
on
the
boat
that
evening
if
i
had
ever
thought
chivalry
dead
i
learned
then
that
i
had
been
mistaken
san
diego
charmed
me
as
we
steamed
the
next
morning
into
its
shining
bay
but
as
our
boat
was
two
hours
late
and
the
was
waiting
i
had
to
decline
reade
enchanting
offers
to
drive
us
around
the
beautiful
place
to
show
me
the
fine
beaches
and
his
quarters
and
all
other
points
of
interest
in
this
old
town
of
southern
california
arizona
not
san
diego
was
my
destination
so
we
took
a
hasty
breakfast
at
the
hotel
and
boarded
the
stage
which
filled
with
passengers
was
waiting
before
the
door
the
driver
waited
for
no
ceremonies
muttered
something
about
being
late
cracked
his
whip
and
away
we
went
i
tried
to
stow
myself
and
my
little
boy
and
my
belongings
away
comfortably
but
the
road
was
rough
and
the
coach
swayed
and
i
gave
it
up
there
were
passengers
on
top
of
the
coach
and
passengers
inside
the
coach
one
woman
who
was
totally
deaf
and
some
miners
and
blacksmiths
and
a
few
other
men
the
flotsam
and
jetsam
of
the
western
countries
who
come
from
no
one
knoweth
whence
and
who
go
no
one
knoweth
whither
who
have
no
trade
or
profession
and
are
sometimes
even
without
a
name
they
seemed
to
want
to
be
kind
to
me
harry
got
very
and
gave
us
much
trouble
and
they
all
helped
me
to
hold
him
night
came
i
do
not
remember
that
we
made
any
stops
at
all
if
we
did
i
have
forgotten
them
the
night
on
that
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
i
do
not
know
of
any
adjectives
that
i
could
apply
to
it
just
before
dawn
we
stopped
to
change
horses
and
driver
and
as
the
day
began
to
break
we
felt
ourselves
going
down
somewhere
at
a
terrific
speed
the
great
concord
coach
slipped
and
slid
and
swayed
on
its
huge
springs
as
we
rounded
the
curves
the
road
was
narrow
and
appeared
to
be
cut
out
of
solid
rock
which
seemed
to
be
as
smooth
as
soapstone
the
four
horses
were
put
to
their
speed
and
down
and
around
and
away
we
went
i
drew
in
my
breath
as
i
looked
out
and
over
into
the
abyss
on
my
left
death
and
destruction
seemed
to
be
the
end
awaiting
us
all
everybody
was
limp
when
we
reached
the
bottom
that
is
i
was
limp
and
i
suppose
the
others
were
the
knew
i
was
frightened
because
i
sat
still
and
looked
white
and
he
came
and
lifted
me
out
he
lived
in
a
small
cabin
at
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
i
talked
with
him
some
the
fact
is
he
said
we
are
an
hour
late
this
morning
we
always
make
it
a
point
to
before
dawn
so
the
passengers
ca
see
anything
they
are
almost
sure
to
get
stampeded
if
we
come
down
by
daylight
i
mentioned
this
road
afterwards
in
san
francisco
and
learned
that
it
was
a
famous
road
cut
out
of
the
side
of
a
solid
mountain
of
rock
long
talked
of
long
desired
and
finally
built
at
great
expense
by
the
state
and
the
county
together
that
they
always
had
the
same
man
to
drive
over
it
and
that
they
never
did
it
by
daylight
i
did
not
inquire
if
there
had
ever
been
any
accidents
i
seemed
to
have
learned
all
i
wanted
to
know
about
it
after
a
little
rest
and
a
breakfast
at
a
sort
of
roadhouse
a
relay
of
horses
was
taken
and
we
travelled
one
more
day
over
a
flat
country
to
the
end
of
the
jack
was
to
meet
me
already
from
the
stage
i
had
espied
the
post
ambulance
and
two
blue
uniforms
out
jumped
major
ernest
and
jack
i
remember
thinking
how
straight
and
how
well
they
looked
i
had
forgotten
really
how
army
men
did
look
i
had
been
so
long
away
and
now
we
were
to
go
to
fort
yuma
and
stay
with
the
wells
until
my
boxes
which
had
been
sent
around
by
water
on
the
steamer
montana
should
arrive
i
had
only
the
usual
thirty
pounds
allowance
of
luggage
with
me
on
the
stage
and
it
was
made
up
entirely
of
my
boy
clothing
and
an
evening
dress
i
had
worn
on
the
last
night
of
my
stay
in
san
francisco
fort
yuma
was
delightful
at
this
season
december
and
after
four
or
five
days
spent
most
enjoyably
we
crossed
over
one
morning
on
the
old
rope
ferryboat
to
yuma
city
to
inquire
at
the
big
country
store
there
of
news
from
the
gulf
there
was
no
bridge
then
over
the
colorado
the
merchant
called
jack
to
one
side
and
said
something
to
him
in
a
low
tone
i
was
sure
it
concerned
the
steamer
and
i
said
what
it
is
then
they
told
me
that
news
had
just
been
received
from
below
that
the
montana
had
been
burned
to
the
water
edge
in
guaymas
harbor
and
everything
on
board
destroyed
the
passengers
had
been
saved
with
much
difficulty
as
the
disaster
occurred
in
the
night
i
had
lost
all
the
clothes
i
had
in
the
world
and
my
precious
boxes
were
gone
i
scarcely
knew
how
to
meet
the
calamity
jack
said
do
mind
mattie
i
so
thankful
you
and
the
boy
were
not
on
board
the
ship
the
things
are
nothing
no
account
at
all
but
said
i
you
do
not
understand
i
have
no
clothes
except
what
i
have
on
and
a
party
dress
oh
what
shall
i
do
i
cried
the
merchant
was
very
sympathetic
and
kind
and
major
wells
said
go
home
and
tell
fanny
maybe
she
can
suggest
something
i
turned
toward
the
counter
and
bought
some
sewing
materials
realizing
that
outside
of
my
toilet
articles
and
my
party
dress
all
my
personal
belongings
were
swept
away
i
was
in
a
country
where
there
were
no
dressmakers
and
no
shops
i
was
for
the
time
being
a
pauper
as
far
as
clothing
was
concerned
when
i
got
back
to
wells
i
broke
down
entirely
she
put
her
arms
around
me
and
said
i
heard
all
about
it
i
know
just
how
you
must
feel
now
come
in
my
room
and
we
see
what
can
be
done
she
laid
out
enough
clothing
to
last
me
until
i
could
get
some
things
from
the
east
and
gave
me
a
grey
and
white
percale
dress
with
a
basque
and
a
border
and
although
it
was
all
very
much
too
large
for
me
it
sufficed
to
relieve
my
immediate
distress
letters
were
dispatched
to
the
east
in
various
directions
for
every
sort
and
description
of
clothing
but
it
was
at
least
two
months
before
any
of
it
appeared
and
i
felt
like
an
object
of
charity
for
a
long
time
then
too
i
had
anticipated
the
fitting
up
of
our
quarters
with
all
the
pretty
cretonnes
and
other
things
i
had
brought
from
home
and
now
the
contents
of
those
boxes
were
no
more
the
memory
of
the
visit
was
all
that
was
left
to
me
it
was
very
hard
to
bear
preparations
for
our
journey
to
camp
macdowell
were
at
last
completed
the
route
to
our
new
post
lay
along
the
valley
of
the
gila
river
following
it
up
from
its
mouth
where
it
empties
into
the
colorado
eastwards
towards
the
southern
middle
portion
of
arizona
chapter
xxiv
up
the
valley
of
the
gila
the
december
sun
was
shining
brightly
down
as
only
the
arizona
sun
can
shine
at
high
noon
in
winter
when
we
crossed
the
colorado
on
the
primitive
ferryboat
drawn
by
ropes
clambered
up
into
the
great
wagon
or
ambulance
with
its
dusty
white
canvas
covers
all
rolled
up
at
the
sides
said
to
our
kind
hosts
of
fort
yuma
and
started
rattling
along
the
sandy
main
street
of
yuma
city
for
old
camp
macdowell
our
big
blue
army
wagon
which
had
been
provided
for
my
boxes
and
trunks
rumbling
along
behind
us
empty
except
for
the
camp
equipage
but
it
all
seemed
so
good
to
me
i
was
happy
to
see
the
soldiers
again
the
drivers
and
teamsters
and
even
the
sleek
government
mules
the
old
blue
uniforms
made
my
heart
glad
every
sound
was
familiar
even
the
rattling
of
the
harness
with
its
ivory
rings
and
the
harsh
sound
of
the
heavy
brakes
reinforced
with
old
leather
soles
even
the
country
looked
attractive
smiling
under
the
december
sun
i
wondered
if
i
had
really
grown
to
love
the
desert
i
had
read
somewhere
that
people
did
but
i
was
not
paying
much
attention
in
those
days
to
the
analysis
of
my
feelings
i
did
not
stop
to
question
the
subtle
fascination
which
i
felt
steal
over
me
as
we
rolled
along
the
smooth
hard
roads
that
followed
the
windings
of
the
gila
river
i
was
back
again
in
the
army
i
had
cast
my
lot
with
a
soldier
and
where
he
was
was
home
to
me
in
nantucket
no
one
thought
much
about
the
army
the
uniform
of
the
regulars
was
never
seen
there
the
profession
of
arms
was
scarcely
known
or
heard
of
few
people
manifested
any
interest
in
the
life
of
the
far
west
i
had
while
there
felt
out
of
touch
with
my
oldest
friends
only
my
darling
old
uncle
a
brave
old
whaling
captain
had
said
mattie
i
am
much
interested
in
all
you
have
written
us
about
arizona
come
right
down
below
and
show
me
on
the
map
just
where
you
went
gladly
i
followed
him
down
the
stairs
and
he
took
his
pencil
out
and
began
to
trace
after
he
had
crossed
the
mississippi
there
did
not
seem
to
be
anything
but
blank
country
and
i
could
not
find
arizona
and
it
was
written
in
large
letters
across
the
entire
half
of
this
antique
map
unexplored
true
enough
he
laughed
i
must
buy
me
a
new
map
but
he
drew
his
pencil
around
cape
horn
and
up
the
pacific
coast
and
i
described
to
him
the
voyages
i
had
made
on
the
old
newbern
and
his
face
was
aglow
with
memories
yes
he
said
in
we
put
into
san
francisco
harbor
and
sent
our
boats
up
to
san
jose
for
water
and
we
took
goats
from
some
of
those
islands
too
oh
i
know
the
coast
well
enough
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
ocean
then
after
right
whales
but
as
a
rule
people
there
seemed
to
have
little
interest
in
the
army
and
it
had
made
me
feel
as
one
apart
gila
city
was
our
first
camp
not
exactly
a
city
to
be
sure
at
that
time
whatever
it
may
be
now
we
were
greeted
by
the
sight
of
a
few
old
adobe
houses
and
the
usual
saloon
i
had
ceased
however
to
dwell
upon
such
trifles
as
names
even
filibuster
the
name
of
our
next
camp
elicited
no
remark
from
me
the
weather
was
fine
beyond
description
each
day
at
noon
we
got
out
of
the
ambulance
and
sat
down
on
the
warm
white
sand
by
a
little
clump
of
mesquite
and
ate
our
luncheon
coveys
of
quail
flew
up
and
we
shot
them
thereby
insuring
a
good
supper
the
mules
trotted
along
contentedly
on
the
smooth
white
road
which
followed
the
south
bank
of
the
gila
river
myriads
of
lizards
ran
out
and
looked
at
us
hello
here
you
are
again
they
seemed
to
say
the
gila
valley
in
december
was
quite
a
different
thing
from
the
mojave
desert
in
september
and
although
there
was
not
much
to
see
in
that
low
flat
country
yet
we
three
were
joyous
and
happy
good
health
again
was
mine
the
travelling
was
ideal
there
were
no
discomforts
and
i
experienced
no
terrors
in
this
part
of
arizona
each
morning
when
the
tent
was
struck
and
i
sat
on
the
by
the
little
heap
of
ashes
which
was
all
that
remained
of
what
had
been
so
pleasant
a
home
for
an
afternoon
and
a
night
a
little
lonesome
feeling
crept
over
me
at
the
thought
of
leaving
the
place
so
strong
is
the
instinct
and
love
of
home
in
some
people
that
the
little
tendrils
shoot
out
in
a
day
and
weave
themselves
around
a
spot
which
has
given
them
shelter
such
as
those
are
not
born
to
be
nomads
camps
were
made
at
stanwix
oatman
flat
and
gila
bend
there
we
left
the
river
which
makes
a
mighty
loop
at
this
point
and
struck
across
the
plains
to
maricopa
wells
the
last
day
march
took
us
across
the
gila
river
over
the
maricopa
desert
and
brought
us
to
the
salt
river
we
forded
it
at
sundown
rested
our
animals
a
half
hour
or
so
and
drove
through
the
macdowell
canon
in
the
dark
of
the
evening
nine
miles
more
to
the
post
a
day
march
of
miles
a
relay
of
mules
had
been
sent
to
meet
us
at
the
salt
river
but
by
some
oversight
we
had
missed
it
jack
had
told
me
of
the
curious
cholla
cactus
which
is
said
to
nod
at
the
approach
of
human
beings
and
to
deposit
its
barbed
needles
at
their
feet
also
i
had
heard
stories
of
this
deep
dark
canon
and
things
that
had
happened
there
fort
macdowell
was
in
maricopa
county
arizona
on
the
verde
river
seventy
miles
or
so
south
of
camp
verde
the
roving
bands
of
indians
escaping
from
camp
apache
and
the
san
carlos
reservation
which
lay
far
to
the
east
and
southeast
often
found
secure
hiding
places
in
the
fastnesses
of
the
superstition
mountains
and
other
ranges
which
lay
between
old
camp
macdowell
and
these
reservations
hence
a
company
of
cavalry
and
one
of
infantry
were
stationed
at
camp
macdowell
and
the
officers
and
men
of
this
small
command
were
kept
busy
scouting
and
driving
the
renegades
from
out
of
this
part
of
the
country
back
to
their
reservations
it
was
by
no
means
an
idle
post
as
i
found
after
i
got
there
the
life
at
camp
macdowell
meant
hard
work
exposure
and
fatigue
for
this
small
body
of
men
as
we
wound
our
way
through
this
deep
dark
canon
after
crossing
the
salt
river
i
remembered
the
things
i
had
heard
of
ambush
and
murder
our
animals
were
too
tired
to
go
out
of
a
walk
the
night
fell
in
black
shadows
down
between
those
high
mountain
walls
the
chollas
which
are
a
pale
color
in
the
took
on
a
ghastly
hue
they
were
dotted
here
and
there
along
the
road
and
on
the
steep
mountainsides
they
grew
nearly
as
tall
as
a
man
and
on
each
branch
were
great
excrescences
which
looked
like
people
heads
in
the
vague
light
which
fell
upon
them
they
nodded
to
us
and
it
made
me
shudder
they
seemed
to
be
something
human
the
soldiers
were
not
partial
to
macdowell
canon
they
knew
too
much
about
the
place
and
we
all
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
we
emerged
from
this
dark
uncanny
road
and
saw
the
lights
of
the
post
lying
low
long
flat
around
a
square
chapter
xxv
old
camp
macdowell
we
were
expected
evidently
for
as
we
drove
along
the
road
in
front
of
the
officers
quarters
they
all
came
out
to
meet
us
and
we
received
a
great
welcome
captain
corliss
of
c
company
welcomed
us
to
the
post
and
to
his
company
and
said
he
hoped
i
should
like
macdowell
better
than
i
did
ehrenberg
now
ehrenberg
seemed
years
agone
and
i
could
laugh
at
the
mention
of
it
supper
was
awaiting
us
at
captain
corliss
and
kendall
wife
of
lieutenant
kendall
sixth
cavalry
had
in
jack
absence
put
the
finishing
touches
to
our
quarters
so
i
went
at
once
to
a
comfortable
home
and
life
in
the
army
began
again
for
me
how
good
everything
seemed
there
was
doctor
clark
whom
i
had
met
first
at
ehrenberg
and
who
wanted
to
throw
patrocina
and
jesusita
into
the
colorado
i
was
so
glad
to
find
him
there
he
was
such
a
good
doctor
and
we
never
had
a
moment
anxiety
as
long
as
he
staid
at
camp
macdowell
our
confidence
in
him
was
unbounded
it
was
easy
enough
to
obtain
a
man
from
the
company
there
were
then
no
hateful
laws
forbidding
soldiers
to
work
in
officers
families
no
dreaded
inspectors
who
put
the
flat
question
do
you
employ
a
soldier
for
menial
labor
captain
corliss
gave
me
an
old
man
by
the
name
of
smith
and
he
was
glad
to
come
and
stay
with
us
and
do
what
simple
cooking
we
required
one
of
the
laundresses
let
me
have
her
daughter
for
nurserymaid
and
our
small
establishment
at
camp
macdowell
moved
on
smoothly
if
not
with
elegance
the
officers
quarters
were
a
long
low
line
of
adobe
buildings
with
no
space
between
them
the
houses
were
separated
only
by
thick
walls
in
front
the
windows
looked
out
over
the
parade
ground
in
the
rear
they
opened
out
on
a
road
which
ran
along
the
whole
length
and
on
the
other
side
of
which
lay
another
row
of
long
low
buildings
which
were
the
kitchens
each
set
of
quarters
having
its
own
we
occupied
the
quarters
at
the
end
of
the
row
and
a
large
bay
window
looked
out
over
a
rather
desolate
plain
and
across
to
the
large
and
hospital
as
all
my
draperies
and
pretty
cretonnes
had
been
burnt
up
on
the
ship
i
had
nothing
but
bare
white
shades
at
the
windows
and
the
rooms
looked
desolate
enough
but
a
long
divan
was
soon
built
and
some
coarse
yellow
cotton
bought
at
john
smith
the
sutler
store
to
cover
it
my
pretty
rugs
and
mats
were
also
gone
and
there
was
only
the
old
ingrain
carpet
from
fort
russell
the
floors
were
adobe
and
some
men
from
the
company
came
and
laid
down
old
canvas
then
the
carpet
and
drove
in
great
spikes
around
the
edge
to
hold
it
down
the
floors
of
the
bedroom
and
were
covered
with
canvas
in
the
same
manner
our
furnishings
were
very
scanty
and
i
felt
very
mournful
about
the
loss
of
the
boxes
we
could
not
claim
restitution
as
the
steamship
company
had
been
courteous
enough
to
take
the
boxes
down
free
of
charge
john
smith
the
post
trader
the
name
sutler
fell
into
disuse
about
now
kept
a
large
store
but
nothing
that
i
could
use
to
beautify
my
quarters
with
and
our
losses
had
been
so
heavy
that
we
really
could
not
afford
to
send
back
east
for
more
things
my
new
white
dresses
came
and
were
suitable
enough
for
the
winter
climate
of
macdowell
but
i
missed
the
thousand
and
one
accessories
of
a
woman
wardrobe
the
accumulation
of
years
the
comfortable
things
which
money
could
not
buy
especially
at
that
distance
i
had
never
learned
how
to
make
dresses
or
to
fit
garments
and
although
i
knew
how
to
sew
my
accomplishments
ran
more
in
the
line
of
outdoor
sports
but
kendall
whose
experience
in
frontier
life
had
made
her
lent
me
some
patterns
and
i
bought
some
of
john
calico
and
went
to
work
to
make
gowns
suited
to
the
hot
weather
this
was
in
and
every
one
will
remember
that
the
were
not
to
be
had
in
those
days
in
the
excellence
and
profusion
in
which
they
can
be
found
in
all
parts
of
the
country
now
kendall
was
a
tall
fine
woman
much
larger
than
i
but
i
used
her
patterns
without
alterations
and
the
result
was
something
like
a
bag
they
were
freshly
laundried
and
cool
however
and
i
did
not
place
so
much
importance
on
the
lines
of
them
as
the
young
women
of
the
present
time
do
the
poorest
farmer
wife
in
the
wilds
of
arkansas
or
alaska
can
wear
better
fitting
gowns
than
i
wore
then
but
my
riding
habits
of
which
i
had
several
kinds
to
suit
warm
and
cold
countries
had
been
left
in
jack
care
at
ehrenberg
and
as
long
as
these
fitted
well
it
did
not
so
much
matter
about
the
gowns
captain
chaffee
who
commanded
the
company
of
the
sixth
cavalry
stationed
there
was
away
on
leave
but
kendall
his
first
lieutenant
consented
for
me
to
exercise
cochise
captain
indian
pony
and
i
had
a
royal
time
cavalry
officers
usually
hate
riding
that
is
riding
for
pleasure
for
they
are
in
the
saddle
so
much
for
dead
earnest
work
but
a
young
officer
a
second
lieutenant
not
long
out
from
the
academy
liked
to
ride
and
we
had
many
pleasant
riding
parties
dravo
and
i
rode
one
day
to
the
mormon
settlement
seventeen
miles
away
on
some
business
with
the
bishop
and
a
mormon
woman
gave
us
a
lunch
of
fried
salt
pork
potatoes
bread
and
milk
how
good
it
tasted
after
our
long
ride
and
how
we
laughed
about
it
all
and
jollied
after
the
fashion
of
young
people
all
the
way
back
to
the
post
mr
dravo
had
also
lost
all
his
things
on
the
montana
and
we
sympathized
greatly
with
each
other
he
however
had
sent
an
order
home
to
pennsylvania
duplicating
all
the
contents
of
his
boxes
i
told
him
i
could
not
duplicate
mine
if
i
sent
a
thousand
orders
east
when
after
some
months
his
boxes
came
he
brought
me
in
a
package
done
up
in
tissue
paper
and
tied
with
ribbon
mother
sends
you
these
she
wrote
that
i
was
not
to
open
them
i
think
she
felt
sorry
for
you
when
i
wrote
her
you
had
lost
all
your
clothing
i
suppose
he
added
mustering
his
west
point
french
to
the
front
and
handing
me
the
package
it
is
what
you
ladies
call
i
hope
i
blushed
and
i
think
i
did
for
i
was
not
so
very
old
and
i
was
touched
by
this
sweet
remembrance
from
the
dear
mother
back
in
pittsburgh
and
so
many
lovely
things
happened
all
the
time
everybody
was
so
kind
to
me
kendall
and
her
young
sister
kate
taylor
john
smith
and
i
were
the
only
women
that
winter
at
camp
macdowell
afterwards
captain
corliss
brought
a
bride
to
the
post
and
a
new
doctor
took
doctor
clark
place
there
were
interminable
scouts
which
took
both
cavalry
and
infantry
out
of
the
post
we
heard
a
great
deal
about
chasing
injuns
in
the
superstition
mountains
and
once
a
lieutenant
of
infantry
went
out
to
chase
an
escaping
indian
agent
old
smith
my
cook
was
not
very
satisfactory
he
drank
a
good
deal
and
i
got
very
tired
of
the
trouble
he
caused
me
it
was
before
the
days
of
the
canteen
and
soldiers
could
get
all
the
whiskey
they
wanted
at
the
trader
store
and
it
being
generally
the
brand
that
was
known
in
the
army
as
forty
rod
they
got
very
drunk
on
it
sometimes
i
never
had
it
in
my
heart
to
blame
them
much
poor
fellows
for
every
human
beings
wants
and
needs
some
sort
of
recreation
and
jovial
excitement
captain
corliss
said
to
jack
one
day
in
my
presence
i
had
a
fine
batch
of
recruits
come
in
this
morning
that
lovely
said
i
what
kind
of
men
are
they
any
good
cooks
amongst
them
for
i
was
getting
very
tired
of
smith
captain
corliss
smiled
a
grim
smile
what
do
you
think
the
united
states
government
enlists
men
for
said
he
do
you
think
i
want
my
company
to
be
made
up
of
he
was
really
quite
angry
with
me
and
i
concluded
that
i
had
been
too
abrupt
in
my
eagerness
for
another
man
and
that
my
ideas
on
the
subject
were
becoming
warped
i
decided
that
i
must
be
more
diplomatic
in
the
future
in
my
dealings
with
the
captain
of
c
company
the
next
day
when
we
went
to
breakfast
whom
did
we
find
in
the
but
bowen
our
old
bowen
of
the
long
march
across
the
territory
of
camp
apache
and
k
company
he
had
his
white
apron
on
his
hair
rolled
back
in
his
most
fetching
style
and
was
putting
the
coffee
on
the
table
but
bowen
said
i
where
how
on
earth
did
you
how
did
you
know
we
what
does
it
mean
bowen
saluted
the
first
lieutenant
of
c
company
and
said
well
sir
the
fact
is
my
time
was
out
and
i
thought
i
would
quit
i
went
to
san
francisco
and
worked
in
a
miners
restaurant
here
he
hesitated
but
i
did
like
it
and
i
tried
something
else
and
lost
all
my
money
and
i
got
tired
of
the
town
so
i
thought
i
take
on
again
and
as
i
knowed
ye
were
in
c
company
now
i
thought
i
come
to
macdowell
and
i
came
over
here
this
morning
and
told
old
smith
he
better
quit
this
was
my
job
and
here
i
am
and
i
hope
ye
all
well
and
the
little
boy
here
was
loyalty
indeed
and
here
was
bowen
the
immortal
back
again
and
now
things
ran
smoothly
once
more
roasts
of
beef
and
haunches
of
venison
ducks
and
other
good
things
we
had
through
the
winter
it
was
cool
enough
to
wear
white
cotton
dresses
but
nothing
heavier
it
never
rained
and
the
climate
was
superb
although
it
was
always
hot
in
the
sun
we
had
heard
that
it
was
very
hot
here
in
fact
people
called
macdowell
by
very
bad
names
as
the
spring
came
on
we
began
to
realize
that
the
epithets
applied
to
it
might
be
quite
appropriate
in
front
of
our
quarters
was
a
ramada
supported
by
rude
poles
of
the
cottonwood
tree
then
came
the
sidewalk
and
the
acequia
ditch
then
a
row
of
young
cottonwood
trees
then
the
parade
ground
through
the
acequia
ran
the
clear
water
that
supplied
the
post
and
under
the
shade
of
the
ramadas
hung
the
large
ollas
from
which
we
dipped
the
drinking
water
for
as
yet
of
course
ice
was
not
even
dreamed
of
in
the
far
plains
of
macdowell
the
heat
became
intense
as
the
summer
approached
to
sleep
inside
the
house
was
impossible
and
we
soon
followed
the
example
of
the
cavalry
who
had
their
beds
out
on
the
parade
ground
sort
of
rude
awning
made
of
brush
and
supported
by
cottonwood
poles
two
iron
cots
therefore
were
brought
from
the
hospital
and
placed
side
by
side
in
front
of
our
quarters
beyond
the
acequia
and
the
cottonwood
trees
in
fact
out
in
the
open
space
of
the
parade
ground
upon
these
were
laid
some
mattresses
and
sheets
and
after
taps
had
sounded
and
lights
were
out
we
retired
to
rest
near
the
cots
stood
harry
crib
we
had
not
thought
about
the
ants
however
and
they
swarmed
over
our
beds
driving
us
into
the
house
the
next
morning
bowen
placed
a
tin
can
of
water
under
each
point
of
contact
and
as
each
cot
had
eight
legs
and
the
crib
had
four
twenty
cans
were
necessary
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
remove
the
labels
and
the
pictures
of
red
tomatoes
glared
at
us
in
the
hot
sun
through
the
day
they
did
not
look
poetic
but
our
old
enemies
the
ants
were
outwitted
there
was
another
species
of
tiny
insect
however
which
seemed
to
drop
from
the
little
trees
which
grew
at
the
edge
of
the
acequia
and
myriads
of
them
descended
and
crawled
all
over
us
so
we
had
to
have
our
beds
moved
still
farther
out
on
to
the
open
space
of
the
parade
ground
and
now
we
were
fortified
against
all
the
venomous
creeping
things
and
we
looked
forward
to
blissful
nights
of
rest
we
did
not
look
along
the
line
when
we
retired
to
our
cots
but
if
we
had
we
should
have
seen
shadowy
figures
laden
with
pillows
flying
from
the
houses
to
the
cots
or
vice
versa
it
was
certainly
a
novel
experience
with
but
a
sheet
for
a
covering
there
we
lay
looking
up
at
the
starry
heavens
i
watched
the
great
bear
go
around
and
other
constellations
and
seemed
to
come
into
close
touch
with
nature
and
the
mysterious
night
but
the
melancholy
solemnity
of
my
communings
was
much
affected
by
the
howling
of
the
coyotes
which
seemed
sometimes
to
be
so
near
that
i
jumped
to
the
side
of
the
crib
to
see
if
my
little
boy
was
being
carried
off
the
good
sweet
slumber
which
i
craved
never
came
to
me
in
those
weird
arizona
nights
under
the
stars
at
about
midnight
a
sort
of
dewy
coolness
would
come
down
from
the
sky
and
we
could
then
sleep
a
little
but
the
sun
rose
incredibly
early
in
that
southern
country
and
by
the
crack
of
dawn
sheeted
figures
were
to
be
seen
darting
back
into
the
quarters
to
try
for
another
nap
the
nap
rarely
came
to
any
of
us
for
the
heat
of
the
houses
never
passed
off
day
or
night
at
that
season
after
an
early
breakfast
the
long
day
began
again
the
question
of
what
to
eat
came
to
be
a
serious
one
we
experimented
with
all
sorts
of
tinned
foods
and
tried
to
produce
some
variety
from
them
but
it
was
all
rather
tiresome
we
almost
dreaded
the
visits
of
the
paymaster
and
the
inspector
at
that
season
as
we
never
had
anything
in
the
house
to
give
them
one
hot
night
at
about
ten
we
heard
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
an
ambulance
drew
up
at
our
door
out
jumped
colonel
biddle
inspector
general
from
fort
whipple
what
shall
i
give
him
to
eat
poor
hungry
man
i
thought
i
looked
in
the
safe
which
hung
outside
the
kitchen
and
discovered
half
a
the
gallant
colonel
declared
that
if
there
was
one
thing
above
all
others
that
he
liked
it
was
cold
lieutenant
thomas
of
the
fifth
cavalry
echoed
his
sentiments
and
with
a
bottle
of
cocomonga
which
was
always
kept
cooling
somewhere
they
had
a
merry
supper
these
visits
broke
the
monotony
of
our
life
at
camp
macdowell
we
heard
of
the
gay
doings
up
at
fort
whipple
and
of
the
lovely
climate
there
thomas
said
he
could
not
understand
why
we
wore
such
bags
of
dresses
i
told
him
spitefully
that
if
the
women
of
fort
whipple
would
come
down
to
macdowell
to
spend
the
summer
they
would
soon
be
able
to
explain
it
to
him
i
began
to
feel
embarrassed
at
the
fit
of
my
after
a
few
days
spent
with
us
however
the
mercury
ranging
from
to
degrees
in
the
shade
he
ceased
to
comment
upon
our
dresses
or
our
customs
i
had
a
glass
jar
of
butter
sent
over
from
the
commissary
and
asked
colonel
biddle
if
he
thought
it
right
that
such
butter
as
that
should
be
bought
by
the
purchasing
officer
in
san
francisco
it
had
melted
and
separated
into
layers
of
dead
white
deep
orange
and
colors
thus
i
too
as
well
as
general
miles
had
my
turn
at
trying
to
reform
the
commissary
department
of
uncle
sam
army
hammocks
were
swung
under
the
ramadas
and
after
luncheon
everybody
tried
a
siesta
then
near
sundown
an
ambulance
came
and
took
us
over
to
the
verde
river
about
a
mile
away
where
we
bathed
in
water
almost
as
thick
as
that
of
the
great
colorado
we
taught
kendall
to
swim
but
kendall
being
an
inland
man
did
not
take
to
the
water
now
the
verde
river
was
not
a
very
good
substitute
for
the
sea
and
the
thick
water
filled
our
ears
and
mouths
but
it
gave
us
a
little
half
hour
in
the
day
when
we
could
experience
a
feeling
of
being
cool
and
we
found
it
worth
while
to
take
the
trouble
thick
clumps
of
mesquite
trees
furnished
us
with
we
were
all
young
and
youth
requires
so
little
with
which
to
make
merry
after
the
meagre
evening
dinner
the
kendalls
and
ourselves
sat
together
under
the
ramada
until
taps
listening
generally
to
the
droll
anecdotes
told
by
kendall
who
had
an
inexhaustible
fund
then
another
night
under
the
stars
and
so
passed
the
time
away
we
lived
ate
slept
by
the
bugle
calls
reveille
means
sunrise
when
a
lieutenant
must
hasten
to
put
himself
into
uniform
sword
and
belt
and
go
out
to
receive
the
report
of
the
company
or
companies
of
soldiers
who
stand
drawn
up
in
line
on
the
parade
ground
at
about
nine
in
the
morning
comes
the
a
function
always
which
everybody
goes
out
to
see
then
the
various
drill
calls
and
recalls
and
and
the
beautiful
for
the
cavalry
when
the
horses
are
groomed
and
watered
the
thrilling
and
the
startling
assembly
or
when
every
soldier
jumps
for
his
rifle
and
every
officer
buckles
on
his
sword
and
a
woman
heart
stands
still
then
at
night
tattoo
when
the
company
officers
go
out
to
receive
the
report
of
all
present
and
accounted
for
and
shortly
after
that
the
mournful
taps
a
signal
for
the
barrack
lights
to
be
put
out
the
bugle
call
of
taps
is
mournful
also
through
association
as
it
is
always
blown
over
the
grave
of
a
soldier
or
an
officer
after
the
coffin
has
been
lowered
into
the
earth
the
who
blow
the
calls
seem
to
love
the
call
of
taps
strangely
enough
and
i
remember
well
that
there
at
camp
macdowell
we
all
used
to
go
out
and
listen
when
taps
went
as
the
soldier
who
blew
it
seemed
to
put
a
whole
world
of
sorrow
into
it
turning
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
and
letting
its
clear
tones
tremble
through
the
air
away
off
across
the
maricopa
desert
and
then
toward
the
east
our
home
so
faraway
we
never
spoke
we
just
listened
and
who
can
tell
the
thoughts
that
each
one
had
in
his
mind
church
nor
ministers
nor
priests
had
we
there
in
those
distant
lands
but
can
we
say
that
our
lives
were
wholly
without
religion
the
sunday
inspection
of
men
and
barracks
which
was
performed
with
much
precision
and
formality
and
often
in
full
dress
uniform
gave
us
something
by
which
we
could
mark
the
weeks
as
they
slipped
along
there
was
no
religious
service
of
any
kind
as
uncle
sam
did
not
seem
to
think
that
the
souls
of
us
people
in
the
outposts
needed
looking
after
it
would
have
afforded
much
comfort
to
the
roman
catholics
had
there
been
a
priest
stationed
there
the
only
sermon
i
ever
heard
in
old
camp
macdowell
was
delivered
by
a
mormon
bishop
and
was
of
a
rather
preposterous
nature
neither
instructive
nor
edifying
but
the
good
catholics
read
their
at
home
and
the
rest
of
us
almost
forgot
that
such
organizations
as
churches
existed
another
bright
winter
found
us
still
gazing
at
the
four
peaks
of
the
macdowell
mountains
the
only
landmark
on
the
horizon
i
was
glad
in
those
days
that
i
had
not
staid
back
east
for
the
life
of
an
officer
without
his
family
in
those
drear
places
is
indeed
a
blank
and
empty
one
four
years
i
have
sat
here
and
looked
at
the
four
peaks
said
captain
corliss
one
day
and
i
getting
almighty
tired
of
it
chapter
xxvi
a
sudden
order
in
june
jack
was
ordered
to
report
to
the
commanding
officer
at
fort
lowell
near
the
ancient
city
of
tucson
to
act
as
quartermaster
and
commissary
at
that
post
this
was
a
sudden
and
totally
unexpected
order
it
was
indeed
hard
and
it
seemed
to
me
cruel
for
our
regiment
had
been
four
years
in
the
territory
and
we
were
reasonably
sure
of
being
ordered
out
before
long
tucson
lay
far
to
the
south
of
us
and
was
even
hotter
than
this
place
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
we
packed
up
i
with
a
heavy
heart
jack
with
his
customary
stoicism
with
the
grief
which
comes
only
at
that
time
in
one
life
and
which
sees
no
end
and
no
limit
i
parted
from
my
friends
at
camp
macdowell
two
years
together
in
the
most
intimate
companionship
cut
off
from
the
outside
world
and
away
from
all
early
ties
had
united
us
with
indissoluble
bonds
and
now
we
were
to
part
forever
as
i
thought
we
all
wept
i
embraced
them
all
and
jack
lifted
me
into
the
ambulance
kendall
gave
a
last
kiss
to
our
little
boy
donahue
our
loosened
up
his
brakes
cracked
his
long
whip
and
away
we
went
down
over
the
flat
through
the
dark
macdowell
canon
with
the
chollas
nodding
to
us
as
we
passed
across
the
salt
river
and
on
across
an
open
desert
to
florence
forty
miles
or
so
to
the
southeast
of
us
at
florence
we
sent
our
military
transportation
back
and
staid
over
a
day
at
a
tavern
to
rest
we
met
there
a
very
agreeable
and
cultivated
gentleman
charles
poston
who
was
en
route
to
his
home
somewhere
in
the
mountains
nearby
we
took
the
tucson
stage
at
sundown
and
travelled
all
night
i
heard
afterwards
more
about
poston
he
had
attained
some
reputation
in
the
literary
world
by
writing
about
the
of
asia
he
had
been
a
great
traveller
in
his
early
life
but
now
had
built
himself
some
sort
of
a
house
in
one
of
the
desolate
mountains
which
rose
out
of
these
vast
plains
of
arizona
hoisted
his
on
the
top
there
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
days
people
out
there
said
he
was
a
i
do
not
know
but
when
i
am
tired
of
life
and
people
i
thought
this
will
not
be
the
place
i
shall
choose
arriving
at
tucson
after
a
hot
and
tiresome
night
in
the
stage
we
went
to
an
old
hostelry
tucson
looked
attractive
ancient
civilization
is
always
interesting
to
me
leaving
me
at
the
tavern
my
husband
drove
out
to
fort
lowell
to
see
about
quarters
and
things
in
general
in
a
few
hours
he
returned
with
the
overwhelming
news
that
he
found
a
dispatch
awaiting
him
at
that
post
ordering
him
to
return
immediately
to
his
company
at
camp
macdowell
as
the
eighth
infantry
was
ordered
to
the
department
of
california
ordered
out
at
last
i
felt
like
jumping
up
onto
the
table
climbing
onto
the
roof
dancing
and
singing
and
shouting
for
joy
tired
as
we
were
and
i
thought
i
had
reached
the
limit
we
were
not
too
tired
to
take
the
first
stage
back
for
florence
which
left
that
evening
those
two
nights
on
the
tucson
stage
are
a
blank
in
my
memory
i
got
through
them
somehow
in
the
morning
as
we
approached
the
town
of
florence
the
great
blue
army
wagon
containing
our
household
goods
hove
in
sight
its
white
canvas
cover
stretched
over
hoops
its
six
sturdy
mules
coming
along
at
a
good
trot
and
sergeant
stone
cracking
his
long
whip
to
keep
up
a
proper
pace
in
the
eyes
of
the
tucson
jack
called
him
to
halt
and
down
went
the
sergeant
big
brakes
both
teams
came
to
a
and
we
told
the
sergeant
the
news
bewilderment
surprise
joy
followed
each
other
on
the
old
countenance
he
turned
his
heavy
team
about
and
promised
to
reach
camp
macdowell
as
soon
as
the
animals
could
make
it
at
florence
we
left
the
stage
and
went
to
the
little
tavern
once
more
the
stage
route
did
not
lie
in
our
direction
so
we
must
hire
a
private
conveyance
to
bring
us
to
camp
macdowell
jack
found
a
man
who
had
a
good
pair
of
ponies
and
an
open
buckboard
towards
night
we
set
forth
to
cross
the
plain
which
lies
between
florence
and
the
salt
river
due
northwest
by
the
map
when
i
saw
the
driver
i
did
not
care
much
for
his
appearance
he
did
not
inspire
me
with
confidence
but
the
ponies
looked
strong
and
we
had
forty
or
fifty
miles
before
us
after
we
got
fairly
into
the
desert
which
was
a
trackless
waste
i
became
possessed
by
a
feeling
that
the
man
did
not
know
the
way
he
talked
a
good
deal
about
the
north
star
and
the
fork
in
the
road
and
that
we
must
be
sure
not
to
miss
it
it
was
a
still
hot
starlit
night
jack
and
the
driver
sat
on
the
front
seat
they
had
taken
the
back
seat
out
and
my
little
boy
and
i
sat
in
the
bottom
of
the
wagon
with
the
hard
cushions
to
lean
against
through
the
night
i
suppose
we
were
drowsy
with
sleep
at
all
events
the
talk
about
the
fork
of
the
road
and
the
north
star
faded
away
into
dreams
i
awoke
with
a
chilly
feeling
and
a
sudden
jolt
over
a
rock
i
do
not
recollect
any
rocks
on
this
road
jack
when
we
came
over
it
in
the
ambulance
said
i
neither
do
i
he
replied
i
looked
for
the
north
star
i
had
looked
for
it
often
when
in
open
boats
it
was
away
off
on
our
left
the
road
seemed
to
be
ascending
and
rocky
i
had
never
seen
this
piece
of
road
before
that
i
was
sure
of
we
are
going
to
the
eastward
said
i
and
we
should
be
going
northwest
my
dear
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
the
man
knows
the
road
he
is
taking
a
short
cut
i
suppose
said
the
lieutenant
there
was
something
not
at
all
reassuring
in
his
tones
however
the
driver
did
not
turn
his
head
nor
speak
i
looked
at
the
north
star
which
was
getting
farther
and
farther
on
our
left
and
i
felt
the
gloomy
conviction
that
we
were
lost
on
the
desert
finally
at
daylight
after
going
higher
and
higher
we
drew
up
in
an
old
deserted
the
driver
jerked
his
ponies
up
and
with
a
sullen
gesture
said
we
must
have
missed
the
fork
of
the
road
this
is
picket
post
great
heavens
i
cried
how
far
out
of
the
way
are
we
about
fifteen
miles
he
drawled
you
see
we
shall
have
to
go
back
to
the
place
where
the
road
forks
and
make
a
new
start
i
nearly
collapsed
with
discouragement
i
looked
around
at
the
ruined
walls
and
crumbling
pillars
of
stone
so
weird
and
so
grey
in
the
dawning
light
it
might
have
been
a
worshipping
place
of
the
druids
my
little
son
shivered
with
the
light
chill
which
comes
at
daybreak
in
those
tropical
countries
we
were
hungry
and
tired
and
miserable
my
bones
ached
and
i
felt
like
crying
we
gave
the
poor
ponies
time
to
breathe
and
took
a
bite
of
cold
food
ourselves
ah
that
blighted
and
desolate
place
called
picket
post
forsaken
by
god
and
man
it
might
have
been
the
entrance
to
hades
would
the
ponies
hold
out
they
looked
jaded
to
be
sure
but
we
had
stopped
long
enough
to
breathe
them
and
away
they
trotted
again
down
the
mountain
this
time
instead
of
up
it
was
broad
day
when
we
reached
the
fork
of
the
road
which
we
had
not
been
able
to
see
in
the
night
there
was
no
mistaking
it
now
we
had
travelled
already
about
forty
miles
thirty
more
lay
before
us
but
there
were
no
hills
it
was
all
flat
country
and
the
owner
of
these
brave
little
ponies
said
we
could
make
it
as
we
neared
the
macdowell
canon
we
met
captain
corliss
marching
out
with
his
company
truly
they
had
lost
no
time
in
starting
for
california
and
he
told
his
first
lieutenant
he
would
make
slow
marches
that
we
might
overtake
him
before
he
reached
yuma
we
were
obliged
to
wait
at
camp
macdowell
for
sergeant
stone
to
arrive
with
our
wagonful
of
household
goods
and
then
after
a
mighty
weeding
out
and
repacking
we
set
forth
once
more
with
a
good
team
of
mules
and
a
good
driver
to
join
the
command
we
bade
the
sixth
cavalry
people
once
more
but
i
was
so
nearly
dead
by
this
time
with
the
heat
and
the
fatigue
of
all
this
hard
travelling
and
packing
up
that
the
keener
edge
of
my
emotions
was
dulled
eight
days
and
nights
spent
in
travelling
hither
and
thither
over
those
hot
plains
in
southern
arizona
and
all
for
what
because
somebody
in
ordering
somebody
to
change
his
station
had
forgotten
that
somebody
regiment
was
about
to
be
ordered
out
of
the
country
it
had
been
in
for
four
years
also
because
my
husband
was
a
soldier
who
obeyed
orders
without
questioning
them
if
he
had
been
a
political
many
of
our
misfortunes
might
have
been
averted
but
then
while
i
half
envied
the
wives
of
the
i
took
a
sort
of
pride
in
the
blind
obedience
shown
by
my
own
particular
soldier
to
the
orders
he
received
after
that
week
experience
i
held
another
colloquy
with
myself
and
decided
that
wives
should
not
follow
their
husbands
in
the
army
and
that
if
i
ever
got
back
east
again
i
would
stay
i
simply
could
not
go
on
enduring
these
unmitigated
and
unreasonable
hardships
the
florence
man
staid
over
at
the
post
a
day
or
so
to
rest
his
ponies
i
bade
him
and
told
him
to
take
care
of
those
brave
little
beasts
which
had
travelled
seventy
miles
without
rest
to
bring
us
to
our
destination
he
nodded
pleasantly
and
drove
away
a
queer
customer
i
observed
to
jack
yes
answered
he
they
told
me
in
florence
that
he
was
a
and
desperado
but
there
did
not
seem
to
be
anyone
else
and
my
orders
were
peremptory
so
i
took
him
i
knew
the
ponies
could
pull
us
through
by
the
looks
of
them
and
road
agents
are
all
right
with
army
officers
they
know
they
would
get
anything
if
they
held
up
how
much
did
he
charge
you
for
the
trip
i
asked
sixteen
dollars
was
the
reply
and
so
ended
the
episode
except
that
i
looked
back
to
picket
post
with
a
sort
of
horror
i
thought
no
more
about
it
chapter
xxvii
the
eighth
foot
leaves
arizona
and
now
after
the
eight
days
of
most
distressing
heat
and
the
fatigue
of
all
sorts
and
varieties
of
travelling
the
nights
spent
in
a
or
at
a
desert
inn
or
in
the
road
agent
buckboard
holding
always
my
little
son
close
to
my
side
came
six
days
more
of
journeying
down
the
valley
of
the
gila
we
took
supper
in
phoenix
at
a
place
known
as
devine
i
was
hearing
a
good
deal
about
phoenix
for
even
then
its
gardens
its
orchards
and
its
climate
were
becoming
famous
but
the
season
of
the
year
was
unpropitious
to
form
a
favorable
opinion
of
that
thriving
place
even
if
my
opinions
of
arizona
with
its
soil
and
insufferable
heat
had
not
been
formed
already
we
crossed
the
gila
somewhere
below
there
and
stopped
at
our
old
camping
places
but
the
entire
valley
was
seething
hot
and
the
remembrance
of
the
december
journey
seemed
but
an
aggravating
dream
we
joined
captain
corliss
and
the
company
at
antelope
station
and
in
two
more
days
were
at
yuma
city
by
this
time
the
southern
pacific
railroad
had
been
built
as
far
as
yuma
and
a
bridge
thrown
across
the
colorado
at
this
point
it
seemed
an
incongruity
and
how
burning
hot
the
cars
looked
standing
there
in
the
arizona
sun
after
four
years
in
that
territory
and
remembering
the
days
weeks
and
even
months
spent
in
travelling
on
the
river
or
marching
through
the
deserts
i
could
not
make
the
pullman
cars
seem
a
reality
we
brushed
the
dust
of
the
gila
valley
from
our
clothes
i
unearthed
a
hat
from
somewhere
and
some
wraps
which
had
not
seen
the
light
for
nearly
two
years
and
prepared
to
board
the
train
i
cried
out
in
my
mind
the
prayer
of
the
woman
in
one
of
ehrenberg
stories
to
which
i
used
to
listen
with
unmitigated
delight
when
i
lived
there
the
story
was
this
blank
used
to
live
here
in
ehrenberg
she
hated
the
place
just
as
you
do
but
she
was
obliged
to
stay
finally
after
a
period
of
two
years
she
and
her
sister
who
had
lived
with
her
were
able
to
get
away
i
crossed
over
the
river
with
them
to
lower
california
on
the
old
rope
which
they
used
to
have
near
ehrenberg
and
as
soon
as
the
boat
touched
the
bank
they
jumped
ashore
and
down
they
both
went
upon
their
knees
clasped
their
hands
raised
their
eyes
to
heaven
and
blank
said
thank
thee
oh
lord
thou
hast
at
last
delivered
us
from
the
wilderness
and
brought
us
back
to
god
country
receive
my
thanks
oh
lord
and
then
fisher
used
to
add
and
the
tears
rolled
down
their
faces
and
i
knew
they
felt
every
word
they
spoke
and
i
guess
you
feel
about
the
same
way
when
you
get
out
of
arizona
even
if
you
do
quite
drop
on
your
knees
he
said
the
soldiers
did
not
look
half
so
picturesque
climbing
into
the
cars
as
they
did
when
loading
onto
a
barge
and
when
the
train
went
across
the
bridge
and
we
looked
down
upon
the
swirling
red
waters
of
the
great
colorado
from
the
windows
of
a
luxurious
pullman
i
sighed
and
with
the
strange
contradictoriness
of
the
human
mind
i
felt
sorry
that
the
old
days
had
come
to
an
end
for
somehow
the
hardships
and
deprivations
which
we
have
endured
lose
their
bitterness
when
they
have
become
only
a
memory
chapter
xxviii
california
and
nevada
a
portion
of
our
regiment
was
ordered
to
oregon
to
join
general
howard
who
was
conducting
the
bannock
campaign
so
i
remained
that
summer
in
san
francisco
to
await
my
husband
return
i
could
not
break
away
from
my
arizona
habits
i
wore
only
white
dresses
partly
because
i
had
no
others
which
were
in
fashion
partly
because
i
had
become
imbued
with
a
profound
indifference
to
dress
they
think
you
a
mexican
said
my
new
england
aunt
who
regarded
all
foreigners
with
contempt
let
them
think
said
i
i
almost
wish
i
were
for
after
all
they
are
the
only
people
who
understand
the
philosophy
of
living
look
at
the
tired
faces
of
the
women
in
your
streets
i
added
one
never
sees
that
sort
of
expression
down
below
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
not
to
be
caught
by
the
whirlpool
of
advanced
civilization
again
added
to
the
white
dresses
i
smoked
cigarettes
and
slept
all
the
afternoons
i
was
in
the
bondage
of
tropical
customs
and
i
had
lapsed
back
into
a
state
of
what
my
aunt
called
let
me
enjoy
this
heavenly
cool
climate
and
do
not
worry
me
i
begged
i
shuddered
when
i
heard
people
complain
of
the
cold
winds
of
the
san
francisco
summer
how
do
they
dare
tempt
fate
thought
i
and
i
wished
them
all
in
ehrenberg
or
macdowell
for
one
summer
i
think
they
might
then
know
something
about
climate
and
would
have
something
to
complain
about
how
i
revelled
in
the
flowers
and
all
the
luxuries
of
that
delightful
city
the
headquarters
of
the
eighth
was
located
at
benicia
and
general
kautz
our
colonel
invited
me
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
wife
a
pleasant
up
the
sacramento
river
brought
us
to
benicia
kautz
a
handsome
and
accomplished
austrian
presided
over
her
lovely
army
home
in
a
manner
to
captivate
my
fancy
and
the
luxury
of
their
surroundings
almost
made
me
speechless
the
other
side
of
army
life
thought
i
a
visit
to
angel
island
one
of
the
harbor
defences
strengthened
this
impression
four
years
of
life
in
the
southern
posts
of
arizona
had
almost
made
me
believe
that
army
life
was
indeed
but
glittering
misery
as
the
germans
had
called
it
in
the
autumn
the
troops
returned
from
oregon
and
c
company
was
ordered
to
camp
macdermit
a
lonely
spot
up
in
the
northern
part
of
nevada
nevada
being
included
in
the
department
of
california
i
was
sure
by
that
time
that
bad
luck
was
pursuing
us
i
did
not
know
so
much
about
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
army
then
as
i
do
now
at
my
aunt
suggestion
i
secured
a
chinaman
of
good
caste
for
a
servant
and
by
deceiving
him
also
my
aunt
advice
with
the
idea
that
we
were
going
only
as
far
as
sacramento
succeeded
in
making
him
willing
to
accompany
us
we
started
east
and
left
the
railroad
at
a
station
called
winnemucca
macdermit
lay
ninety
miles
to
the
north
but
at
winnemucca
the
chinaman
balked
you
say
same
saclamento
lis
place
heap
too
far
me
no
likee
i
talked
to
him
and
being
a
good
sort
he
saw
that
i
meant
well
and
the
soldiers
bundled
him
on
top
of
the
army
wagon
gave
him
a
lot
of
guying
and
a
revolver
to
keep
off
indians
and
so
we
secured
hoo
chack
captain
corliss
had
been
obliged
to
go
on
ahead
with
his
wife
who
was
in
the
most
delicate
health
the
post
ambulance
had
met
them
at
this
place
jack
was
to
march
over
the
ninety
miles
with
the
company
i
watched
them
starting
out
the
men
glad
of
the
release
from
the
railroad
train
their
guns
on
their
shoulders
stepping
off
in
military
style
and
in
good
form
the
wagons
followed
the
big
blue
army
wagons
and
hoo
chack
looking
rather
glum
sitting
on
top
of
a
pile
of
baggage
i
took
the
silver
city
stage
and
except
for
my
little
boy
i
was
the
only
passenger
for
the
most
of
the
way
we
did
the
ninety
miles
without
resting
over
except
for
relays
of
horses
i
climbed
up
on
the
box
and
talked
with
the
driver
i
liked
these
they
were
nervy
fearless
men
and
kind
too
and
had
a
great
dash
and
go
about
them
they
often
had
a
quiet
and
gentle
bearing
but
by
that
time
i
knew
pretty
well
what
sort
of
stuff
they
were
made
of
and
i
liked
to
have
them
talk
to
me
and
i
liked
to
look
out
upon
the
world
through
their
eyes
and
judge
of
things
from
their
standpoint
it
was
an
easy
journey
and
we
passed
a
comfortable
night
in
the
stage
camp
macdermit
was
a
colorless
forbidding
sort
of
a
place
only
one
company
was
stationed
there
and
my
husband
was
nearly
always
scouting
in
the
mountains
north
of
us
the
weather
was
severe
and
the
winter
there
was
joyless
and
lonesome
the
extreme
cold
and
the
loneliness
affected
my
spirits
and
i
suffered
from
depression
i
had
no
woman
to
talk
to
for
corliss
who
was
the
only
other
officer
wife
at
the
post
was
confined
to
the
house
by
the
most
delicate
health
and
her
mind
was
wholly
absorbed
by
the
care
of
her
young
infant
there
were
no
nurses
to
be
had
in
that
desolate
corner
of
the
earth
one
day
a
dreadful
looking
man
appeared
at
the
door
a
person
such
as
one
never
sees
except
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
and
i
wondered
what
business
brought
him
he
wore
a
long
black
greasy
frock
coat
a
tall
hat
and
had
the
face
of
a
sneak
he
wanted
the
he
said
but
i
suggested
i
never
heard
of
collecting
taxes
in
a
government
post
soldiers
and
officers
do
not
pay
taxes
that
may
be
he
replied
but
your
chinaman
is
not
a
soldier
and
i
am
going
to
have
his
tax
before
i
leave
this
house
so
ho
i
thought
a
threat
and
the
soldier
blood
rose
in
me
i
was
alone
jack
was
miles
away
up
north
hoo
chack
appeared
in
the
hall
he
had
evidently
heard
the
man
last
remark
now
i
said
this
chinaman
is
in
my
employ
and
he
shall
not
pay
any
tax
until
i
find
out
if
he
be
exempt
or
not
the
man
approached
the
chinaman
hoo
chack
grew
a
shade
paler
i
fancied
he
had
a
knife
under
his
white
shirt
in
fact
he
felt
around
for
it
i
said
hoo
chack
go
away
i
will
talk
to
this
man
i
opened
the
front
door
come
with
me
to
the
we
will
ask
the
commanding
officer
about
this
matter
my
heart
was
really
in
my
mouth
but
i
returned
the
man
steady
and
dogged
gaze
and
he
followed
me
to
captain
corliss
quarters
i
explained
the
matter
to
the
captain
and
left
the
man
to
his
mercy
why
did
you
call
the
sergeant
of
the
guard
and
have
the
man
slapped
into
the
said
jack
when
i
told
him
about
it
afterwards
the
man
had
no
business
around
here
he
was
trying
to
browbeat
you
into
giving
him
a
dollar
i
suppose
the
country
above
us
was
full
of
desperadoes
from
boise
and
silver
city
and
i
was
afraid
to
be
left
alone
so
much
at
night
so
i
begged
captain
corliss
to
let
me
have
a
soldier
to
sleep
in
my
quarters
he
sent
me
old
needham
so
i
installed
old
needham
in
my
guest
chamber
with
his
loaded
rifle
now
old
needham
was
but
a
wisp
of
a
man
long
years
of
service
had
broken
down
his
health
he
was
all
wizened
up
and
feeble
but
he
was
a
soldier
i
felt
safe
and
could
sleep
once
more
just
the
sight
of
needham
and
his
old
blue
uniform
coming
at
night
after
taps
was
a
comfort
to
me
anxiety
filled
my
soul
for
jack
was
scouting
in
the
stein
mountains
all
winter
in
the
snow
after
indians
who
were
avowedly
hostile
and
had
threatened
to
kill
on
sight
he
often
went
out
with
a
small
and
some
indian
scouts
five
or
six
soldiers
and
i
thought
it
quite
wrong
for
him
to
be
sent
into
the
mountains
with
so
small
a
number
camp
macdermit
was
as
i
have
already
mentioned
a
post
we
all
know
what
that
may
mean
on
the
frontier
our
second
lieutenant
was
absent
and
all
the
hard
work
of
winter
scouting
fell
upon
jack
keeping
him
away
for
weeks
at
a
time
the
piute
indians
were
supposed
to
be
peaceful
and
their
old
chief
winnemucca
once
the
warlike
and
dreaded
foe
of
the
white
man
was
now
quiet
enough
and
too
old
to
fight
he
lived
with
his
family
at
an
indian
village
near
the
post
he
came
to
see
me
occasionally
his
dress
was
a
curious
mixture
of
civilization
and
savagery
he
wore
the
chapeau
and
of
a
general
of
the
american
army
with
a
large
epaulette
on
one
shoulder
he
was
very
proud
of
the
coat
because
general
crook
had
given
it
to
him
his
shirt
leggings
and
moccasins
were
of
buckskin
and
the
long
braids
of
his
hair
tied
with
strips
of
red
flannel
gave
the
last
touch
to
this
incongruous
costume
but
i
must
say
that
his
demeanor
was
gentle
and
dignified
and
after
recovering
from
the
superficial
impressions
which
his
startling
costume
had
at
first
made
upon
my
mind
i
could
well
believe
that
he
had
once
been
the
as
he
was
now
the
political
head
of
his
tribe
winnemucca
did
not
disdain
to
accept
some
little
from
me
and
would
sit
down
on
our
veranda
and
munch
them
he
always
showed
me
the
pasteboard
medal
which
hung
around
his
neck
and
which
bore
general
howard
signature
and
he
always
said
general
howard
tell
me
me
good
injun
me
go
up
up
up
pointing
dramatically
towards
heaven
on
one
occasion
feeling
desperate
for
amusement
i
said
to
him
general
howard
very
good
man
but
he
make
a
mistake
where
you
go
is
not
up
up
up
but
pointing
solemnly
to
the
earth
below
us
down
down
down
he
looked
incredulous
but
i
assured
him
it
was
a
nice
place
down
there
some
of
the
scattered
bands
of
the
tribe
however
were
restless
and
unsubdued
and
gave
us
much
trouble
and
it
was
these
bands
that
necessitated
the
scouts
my
little
son
harry
four
years
old
was
my
constant
and
only
companion
during
that
long
cold
and
anxious
winter
my
mother
sent
me
an
appealing
invitation
to
come
home
for
a
year
i
accepted
gladly
and
one
afternoon
in
may
jack
put
us
aboard
the
silver
city
stage
which
passed
daily
through
the
post
our
excellent
chinese
servant
promised
to
stay
with
the
captain
and
take
care
of
him
and
as
i
said
hoo
chack
i
noticed
an
expression
of
real
regret
on
his
usually
stolid
features
occupied
with
my
thoughts
on
entering
the
stage
i
did
not
notice
the
passengers
or
the
man
sitting
next
me
on
the
back
seat
darkness
soon
closed
around
us
and
i
suppose
we
fell
asleep
between
naps
i
heard
a
queer
clanking
sound
but
supposed
it
was
the
chains
of
the
harness
or
the
gear
the
next
morning
as
we
got
out
at
a
relay
station
for
breakfast
i
saw
the
handcuffs
on
the
man
next
to
whom
i
had
sat
all
the
night
long
the
sheriff
was
on
the
box
outside
he
very
obligingly
changed
seats
with
me
for
the
rest
of
the
way
and
evening
found
us
on
the
overland
train
speeding
on
our
journey
east
camp
macdermit
with
its
dreary
associations
and
surroundings
faded
gradually
from
my
mind
like
a
dream
the
year
of
brought
us
several
changes
my
little
daughter
was
born
in
at
our
old
home
in
nantucket
as
i
lay
watching
the
curtains
move
gently
to
and
fro
in
the
soft
and
saw
my
mother
and
sister
moving
about
the
room
and
a
good
old
nurse
rocking
my
baby
in
her
arms
i
could
but
think
of
those
other
days
at
camp
apache
when
i
lay
through
the
long
hours
with
my
baby
by
my
side
watching
listening
for
some
one
to
come
in
there
was
no
one
no
woman
to
come
except
the
poor
laundress
of
the
cavalry
who
did
come
once
a
day
to
care
for
the
baby
ah
what
a
contrast
and
i
had
to
shut
my
eyes
for
fear
i
should
cry
at
the
mere
thought
of
those
other
days
jack
took
a
year
leave
of
absence
and
joined
me
in
the
autumn
at
nantucket
and
the
winter
was
spent
in
new
york
enjoying
the
theatres
and
various
amusements
we
had
so
long
been
deprived
of
here
we
met
again
captain
porter
and
carrie
wilkins
who
was
now
porter
they
were
stationed
at
david
island
one
of
the
harbor
posts
and
we
went
over
to
see
them
yes
he
said
as
jacob
waited
seven
years
for
rachel
so
i
waited
for
carrie
the
following
summer
brought
us
the
good
news
that
captain
company
was
ordered
to
angel
island
in
the
bay
of
san
francisco
thank
goodness
said
jack
c
company
has
got
some
good
luck
at
last
joyfully
we
started
back
on
the
overland
trip
to
california
which
took
about
nine
days
at
that
time
now
travelling
with
a
baby
and
a
boy
was
quite
troublesome
and
we
were
very
glad
when
the
train
had
crossed
the
bleak
sierras
and
swept
down
into
the
lovely
valley
of
the
sacramento
arriving
in
san
francisco
we
went
to
the
old
occidental
hotel
and
as
we
were
going
in
to
dinner
a
card
was
handed
to
us
hoo
chack
was
the
name
on
the
card
that
chinaman
i
cried
to
jack
how
do
you
suppose
he
knew
we
were
here
we
soon
made
arrangements
for
him
to
accompany
us
to
angel
island
and
in
a
few
days
this
heathen
chinee
had
unpacked
all
our
boxes
and
made
our
quarters
very
comfortable
he
was
rather
a
man
and
as
true
and
loyal
as
a
christian
he
never
broke
his
word
and
he
staid
with
us
as
long
as
we
remained
in
california
and
now
we
began
to
live
to
truly
live
for
we
felt
that
the
years
spent
at
those
desert
posts
under
the
scorching
suns
of
arizona
had
cheated
us
out
of
all
but
a
bare
existence
upon
earth
the
flowers
ran
riot
in
our
garden
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
fresh
fish
and
all
the
luxuries
of
that
marvellous
climate
were
brought
to
our
door
a
comfortable
government
steamboat
plied
between
san
francisco
and
its
harbor
posts
and
the
distance
was
not
great
only
three
quarters
of
an
hour
so
we
had
a
taste
of
the
social
life
of
that
fascinating
city
and
could
enjoy
the
theatres
also
on
the
island
we
had
music
and
dancing
as
it
was
the
headquarters
of
the
regiment
kautz
so
brilliant
and
gay
held
grand
court
here
receptions
military
functions
lawn
tennis
bright
uniforms
were
the
order
of
the
day
and
that
incomparable
climate
how
i
revelled
in
it
when
the
fog
rolled
in
from
the
golden
gate
and
enveloped
the
great
city
of
saint
francis
in
its
cold
vapors
the
island
of
the
angels
lay
warm
and
bright
in
the
sunshine
the
old
spaniards
named
it
well
and
the
old
nantucket
whalers
who
sailed
around
cape
horn
on
their
way
to
the
away
back
in
the
eighteen
twenties
used
to
put
in
near
there
for
water
and
were
well
familiar
with
its
bright
shores
before
it
was
touched
by
handiwork
was
there
ever
such
an
emerald
green
as
adorned
those
hills
which
sloped
down
to
the
bay
could
anything
equal
the
fields
of
golden
escholzchia
which
lay
there
in
the
sunshine
or
the
blue
masses
of
which
opened
in
the
mornings
and
held
up
their
pretty
cups
to
catch
the
dew
was
this
a
real
paradise
it
surely
seemed
so
to
us
and
as
if
nature
had
not
done
enough
the
fates
stepped
in
and
sent
all
the
agreeable
young
officers
of
the
regiment
there
to
help
us
enjoy
the
heavenly
spot
there
was
terrett
the
handsome
and
aristocratic
young
baltimorean
one
of
the
finest
men
i
ever
saw
in
uniform
and
richardson
the
stalwart
texan
and
many
others
with
whom
we
danced
and
played
tennis
and
altogether
there
was
so
much
to
do
and
to
enjoy
that
time
rushed
by
and
we
knew
only
that
we
were
happy
and
enchanted
with
life
did
any
uniform
ever
equal
that
of
the
infantry
in
those
days
the
dark
blue
heavily
braided
blouse
the
white
stripe
on
the
light
blue
trousers
the
jaunty
cap
and
then
the
straight
backs
and
the
slim
lines
of
those
youthful
figures
it
seems
to
me
any
woman
who
was
not
an
egyptian
mummy
would
feel
her
heart
thrill
and
her
blood
tingle
at
the
sight
of
them
indians
and
deserts
and
ehrenberg
did
not
exist
for
me
any
more
my
girlhood
seemed
to
have
returned
and
i
enjoyed
everything
with
the
keenest
zest
my
old
friend
charley
bailey
who
had
married
for
his
second
wife
a
most
accomplished
young
san
francisco
girl
lived
next
door
to
us
general
and
kautz
entertained
so
hospitably
and
were
so
beloved
by
all
together
kautz
and
i
read
the
german
classics
and
went
to
the
german
theatre
and
by
and
by
a
very
celebrated
player
friedrich
haase
from
the
royal
theatre
of
berlin
came
to
san
francisco
we
never
missed
a
performance
and
when
his
tour
was
over
kautz
gave
a
lawn
party
at
angel
island
for
him
and
a
few
of
the
members
of
his
company
it
was
charming
i
well
remember
how
the
sun
shone
that
day
and
as
we
strolled
up
from
the
boat
with
them
frau
haase
stopped
looked
at
the
blue
sky
the
lovely
clouds
the
green
slopes
of
the
island
and
said
mein
gott
frau
summerhayes
was
ist
das
fur
ein
paradies
warum
haben
sie
uns
nicht
gesagt
sie
wohnten
im
paradies
so
with
music
and
german
speech
and
strolls
to
the
north
and
to
the
south
batteries
that
wonderful
and
never
day
with
the
great
friedrich
haase
came
to
an
end
the
months
flew
by
and
the
second
winter
found
us
still
there
we
heard
rumors
of
indian
troubles
in
arizona
and
at
last
the
orders
came
the
officers
packed
away
their
evening
clothes
in
camphor
and
had
their
campaign
clothes
put
out
to
air
and
got
their
in
order
and
the
post
was
alive
with
preparations
for
the
field
all
the
families
were
to
stay
behind
the
most
famous
indian
renegade
was
to
be
hunted
down
and
serious
fighting
was
looked
for
at
last
all
was
ready
and
the
day
was
fixed
for
the
departure
of
the
troops
the
winter
rains
had
set
in
and
the
skies
were
grey
as
the
command
marched
down
to
the
boat
the
officers
and
soldiers
were
in
their
campaign
clothes
the
latter
had
their
and
haversacks
slung
over
their
shoulders
and
their
tin
cups
which
hung
from
the
haversacks
rattled
and
jingled
as
they
marched
down
in
even
columns
of
four
over
the
wet
and
grassy
slopes
of
the
parade
ground
where
so
short
a
time
before
all
had
been
glitter
and
sunshine
i
realized
then
perhaps
for
the
first
time
what
the
uniform
really
stood
for
that
every
man
who
wore
it
was
going
out
to
fight
that
they
held
their
lives
as
nothing
the
glitter
was
all
gone
nothing
but
sad
reality
remained
the
officers
wives
and
the
soldiers
wives
followed
the
troops
to
the
dock
the
soldiers
marched
single
file
over
the
of
the
boat
the
officers
said
the
shrill
whistle
of
the
general
mcpherson
sounded
and
they
were
off
we
leaned
back
against
the
and
soldiers
and
officers
wives
alike
all
wept
together
and
now
a
season
of
gloom
came
upon
us
the
skies
were
dull
and
murky
and
the
rain
poured
down
our
old
friend
bailey
who
was
left
behind
on
account
of
illness
grew
worse
and
finally
his
case
was
pronounced
hopeless
his
death
added
to
the
deep
gloom
and
sadness
which
enveloped
us
all
a
few
of
the
soldiers
who
had
staid
on
the
island
to
take
care
of
the
post
carried
poor
bailey
to
the
boat
his
casket
wrapped
in
the
flag
and
followed
by
a
little
procession
of
women
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
sad
the
campaign
lengthened
out
into
months
but
the
california
winters
are
never
very
long
and
before
the
troops
came
back
the
hills
looked
their
brightest
green
again
the
campaign
had
ended
with
no
very
serious
losses
to
our
troops
and
all
was
joyous
again
until
another
order
took
us
from
the
to
the
interior
once
more
chapter
xxix
changing
station
it
was
the
custom
to
change
the
stations
of
the
different
companies
of
a
regiment
about
every
two
years
so
the
autumn
of
found
us
on
the
way
to
fort
halleck
a
post
in
nevada
but
differing
vastly
from
the
desolate
macdermit
station
fort
halleck
was
only
thirteen
miles
south
of
the
overland
railroad
and
lay
near
a
spur
of
the
humboldt
range
there
were
miles
of
between
the
railroad
and
the
post
but
the
mountains
which
rose
abruptly
five
thousand
feet
on
the
far
side
made
a
magnificent
background
for
the
officers
quarters
which
lay
nestled
at
the
bottom
of
the
oh
what
a
lovely
post
i
cried
as
we
drove
in
major
sanford
of
the
first
cavalry
with
captain
carr
and
lieutenant
oscar
brown
received
us
dear
me
i
thought
if
the
first
cavalry
is
made
up
of
such
gallant
men
as
these
the
old
eighth
infantry
will
have
to
look
out
for
its
laurels
sanford
and
carr
gave
us
a
great
welcome
and
vied
with
each
other
in
providing
for
our
comfort
and
we
were
soon
established
it
was
so
good
to
see
the
gay
yellow
of
the
cavalry
again
now
i
rode
to
my
heart
content
and
it
was
good
to
be
alive
to
see
the
cavalry
drill
and
to
ride
through
the
canons
gorgeous
in
their
flaming
autumn
tints
then
again
to
gallop
through
the
jumping
where
we
could
not
turn
starting
up
rabbits
by
the
score
that
little
old
post
now
long
since
abandoned
marked
a
pleasant
epoch
in
our
life
from
the
ranches
scattered
around
we
could
procure
butter
and
squabs
and
young
vegetables
and
the
soldiers
cultivated
great
garden
patches
and
our
small
dinners
and
breakfasts
live
in
delightful
memory
at
the
end
of
two
years
spent
so
pleasantly
with
the
people
of
the
first
cavalry
our
company
was
again
ordered
to
angel
island
but
a
second
very
active
campaign
in
arizona
and
mexico
against
geronimo
took
our
soldiers
away
from
us
and
we
passed
through
a
period
of
considerable
anxiety
june
of
saw
the
entire
regiment
ordered
to
take
station
in
arizona
once
more
we
travelled
to
tucson
in
a
pullman
car
it
was
hot
and
uninteresting
i
had
been
at
tucson
nine
years
before
for
a
few
hours
but
the
place
seemed
unfamiliar
i
looked
for
the
old
tavern
i
saw
only
the
railroad
restaurant
we
went
in
to
take
breakfast
before
driving
out
to
the
post
of
fort
lowell
seven
miles
away
everything
seemed
changed
iced
cantaloupe
was
served
by
a
alert
waiter
then
quail
on
toast
ice
in
arizona
it
was
like
a
dream
and
i
remarked
to
jack
this
is
the
same
arizona
we
knew
in
and
then
i
do
believe
i
like
it
as
well
either
all
this
luxury
does
seem
to
belong
to
the
place
after
a
drive
behind
some
smart
mules
over
a
flat
stretch
of
seven
miles
we
arrived
at
fort
lowell
a
rather
attractive
post
with
a
long
line
of
officers
quarters
before
which
ran
a
level
road
shaded
by
beautiful
great
trees
we
were
assigned
a
half
of
one
of
these
sets
of
quarters
and
as
our
half
had
no
conveniences
for
it
was
arranged
that
we
should
join
a
mess
with
general
and
kautz
and
their
family
we
soon
got
settled
down
to
our
life
there
and
we
had
various
recreations
among
them
driving
over
to
tucson
and
riding
on
horseback
are
those
which
i
remember
best
we
made
a
few
acquaintances
in
tucson
and
they
sometimes
drove
out
in
the
evenings
or
more
frequently
rode
out
on
horseback
then
we
would
gather
together
on
the
kautz
piazza
and
everybody
sang
to
the
accompaniment
of
guitar
it
was
very
hot
of
course
we
had
all
expected
that
but
the
luxuries
obtainable
through
the
coming
of
the
railroad
such
as
ice
and
various
summer
drinks
and
lemons
and
butter
helped
out
to
make
the
summer
there
more
comfortable
we
slept
on
the
piazzas
which
ran
around
the
houses
on
a
level
with
the
ground
at
that
time
the
fad
for
sleeping
out
of
doors
at
least
amongst
civilized
people
did
not
exist
and
our
arrangements
were
entirely
primitive
our
quarters
were
surrounded
by
a
small
yard
and
a
fence
the
latter
was
dilapidated
and
the
gate
swung
on
one
hinge
we
were
seven
miles
from
anywhere
and
surrounded
by
a
desolate
country
i
did
not
experience
the
feeling
of
terror
that
i
had
had
at
camp
apache
for
instance
nor
the
grewsome
fear
of
the
ehrenberg
nor
the
appalling
fright
i
had
known
in
crossing
the
mogollon
range
or
in
driving
through
pass
but
still
there
was
a
haunting
feeling
of
insecurity
which
hung
around
me
especially
at
night
i
was
awfully
afraid
of
snakes
and
no
sooner
had
we
lain
ourselves
down
on
our
cots
to
sleep
than
i
would
hear
a
rustling
among
the
dry
leaves
that
had
blown
in
under
our
beds
then
all
would
be
still
again
then
a
crackling
and
a
rustling
in
a
flash
i
would
be
sitting
up
in
bed
jack
do
you
hear
that
of
course
i
did
not
dare
to
move
or
jump
out
of
bed
so
i
would
sit
rigid
scared
jack
what
is
it
nonsense
mattie
go
to
sleep
the
toads
jumping
about
in
the
leaves
but
my
sleep
was
fitful
and
disturbed
and
i
never
knew
what
a
good
night
rest
was
one
night
i
was
awakened
by
a
tremendous
snort
right
over
my
face
i
opened
my
eyes
and
looked
into
the
wild
eyes
of
a
big
black
bull
i
think
i
must
have
screamed
for
the
bull
ran
clattering
off
the
piazza
and
out
through
the
gate
by
this
time
jack
was
up
and
harry
and
katherine
who
slept
on
the
front
piazza
came
running
out
and
i
said
well
this
is
the
limit
of
all
things
and
if
that
gate
is
mended
i
will
know
the
reason
why
now
i
heard
a
vague
rumor
that
there
was
a
creature
of
this
sort
in
or
near
the
post
and
that
he
had
a
habit
of
wandering
around
at
night
but
as
i
had
never
seen
him
it
had
made
no
great
impression
on
my
mind
jack
had
a
great
laugh
at
me
but
i
did
not
think
then
nor
do
i
now
that
it
was
anything
to
be
laughed
at
we
had
heard
much
of
the
old
mission
of
san
xavier
del
bac
away
the
other
side
of
tucson
kautz
decided
to
go
over
there
and
go
into
camp
and
paint
a
picture
of
san
xavier
it
was
about
sixteen
miles
from
fort
lowell
so
all
the
camp
paraphernalia
was
gotten
ready
and
several
of
the
officers
joined
the
party
and
we
all
went
over
to
san
xavier
and
camped
for
a
few
days
under
the
shadow
of
those
beautiful
old
walls
this
mission
is
almost
unknown
to
the
american
traveler
exquisite
in
color
form
and
architecture
it
stands
there
a
silent
reminder
of
the
past
the
curious
carvings
and
paintings
inside
the
church
and
the
precious
old
vestments
which
were
shown
us
by
an
ancient
custodian
filled
my
mind
with
wonder
the
building
is
partly
in
ruins
and
the
little
squirrels
were
running
about
the
galleries
but
the
great
dome
is
intact
and
many
of
the
wonderful
figures
which
ornament
it
of
course
we
know
the
spanish
built
it
about
the
middle
or
last
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
that
they
tried
to
christianize
the
tribes
of
indians
who
lived
around
in
the
vicinity
but
there
is
no
sign
of
priest
or
communicant
now
nothing
but
a
desolate
plain
around
it
for
miles
no
one
can
possibly
understand
how
the
building
of
this
large
and
beautiful
mission
was
accomplished
and
i
believe
history
furnishes
very
little
information
in
its
archives
was
found
quite
recently
the
charter
given
by
ferdinand
and
isabella
to
establish
the
pueblo
of
tucson
about
the
beginning
of
the
century
after
a
few
delightful
days
we
broke
camp
and
returned
to
fort
lowell
and
now
the
summer
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
we
were
anticipating
the
delights
of
the
winter
climate
at
tucson
when
without
a
note
of
warning
came
the
orders
for
fort
niobrara
we
looked
appalled
in
each
other
faces
the
evening
the
telegram
came
for
we
did
not
even
know
where
fort
niobrara
was
we
all
rushed
into
major
wilhelm
quarters
for
he
always
knew
everything
we
kautz
and
several
of
the
other
ladies
of
the
post
and
myself
were
in
a
state
of
tremendous
excitement
we
pounded
on
major
wilhelm
door
and
we
heard
a
faint
voice
from
his
bedroom
for
it
was
after
ten
then
we
waited
a
few
moments
and
he
said
come
in
we
opened
the
door
but
there
being
no
light
in
his
quarters
we
could
not
see
him
a
voice
said
what
in
the
name
of
but
we
did
not
wait
for
him
to
finish
we
all
shouted
where
is
fort
niobrara
the
devil
he
said
are
we
ordered
there
yes
yes
we
cried
where
is
it
why
girls
he
said
relapsing
into
his
customary
moderate
tones
it
a
hell
of
a
freezing
cold
place
away
up
north
in
nebraska
we
turned
our
backs
and
went
over
to
our
quarters
to
have
a
consultation
and
we
all
retired
with
sad
hearts
now
just
think
of
it
to
come
to
fort
lowell
in
july
only
to
move
in
november
what
could
it
mean
it
was
hard
to
leave
the
sunny
south
to
spend
the
winter
in
those
congealed
regions
in
the
north
we
were
but
just
settled
and
now
came
another
our
establishment
now
with
two
children
several
servants
two
saddle
horses
and
additional
household
furnishings
was
not
so
simple
as
in
the
beginning
of
our
army
life
when
three
chests
and
a
box
or
two
contained
our
worldly
goods
each
move
we
made
was
more
difficult
than
the
last
our
allowance
of
baggage
did
not
begin
to
cover
what
we
had
to
take
along
and
this
added
greatly
to
the
expense
of
moving
the
enormous
waste
attending
a
move
and
the
heavy
outlay
incurred
in
travelling
and
getting
settled
anew
kept
us
always
poor
these
considerations
increased
our
chagrin
over
this
unexpected
change
of
station
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
however
orders
are
relentless
even
if
they
seem
senseless
which
this
one
did
to
the
women
at
least
of
the
eighth
infantry
chapter
xxx
fort
niobrara
the
journey
itself
however
was
not
to
be
dreaded
although
it
was
so
undesired
it
was
entirely
by
rail
across
new
mexico
and
kansas
to
joseph
then
up
the
missouri
river
and
then
across
the
state
to
the
westward
finally
after
four
or
five
days
we
reached
the
small
frontier
town
of
valentine
in
the
very
northwest
corner
of
the
bleak
and
desolate
state
of
nebraska
the
post
of
niobrara
was
four
miles
away
on
the
niobrara
swift
water
river
some
officers
of
the
ninth
cavalry
met
us
at
the
station
with
the
post
ambulances
there
were
six
companies
of
our
regiment
with
headquarters
and
band
it
was
november
and
the
drive
across
the
rolling
gave
us
a
fair
glimpse
of
the
country
around
we
crossed
the
old
bridge
over
the
niobrara
river
and
entered
the
post
the
snow
lay
already
on
the
brown
and
barren
hills
and
the
place
struck
a
chill
to
my
heart
the
ninth
cavalry
took
care
of
all
the
officers
families
until
we
could
get
established
lieutenant
bingham
a
handsome
and
young
bachelor
took
us
with
our
two
children
to
his
quarters
and
made
us
delightfully
at
home
his
quarters
were
luxuriously
furnished
and
he
was
altogether
adorable
this
to
be
sure
helped
to
soften
my
first
harsh
impressions
of
the
place
quarters
were
not
very
plentiful
and
we
were
compelled
to
take
a
house
occupied
by
a
young
officer
of
the
ninth
what
base
ingratitude
it
seemed
after
the
kindness
we
had
accepted
from
his
regiment
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
we
secured
a
colored
cook
who
proved
a
very
treasure
and
on
inquiring
how
she
came
to
be
in
those
wilds
i
learned
that
she
had
accompanied
a
young
heiress
who
eloped
with
a
cavalry
lieutenant
from
her
home
in
new
york
some
years
before
what
a
contrast
was
here
and
what
a
cruel
contrast
with
blood
thinned
down
by
the
enervating
summer
at
tucson
here
we
were
thrust
into
the
polar
regions
ice
and
snow
and
blizzards
blizzards
and
snow
and
ice
the
mercury
disappeared
at
the
bottom
of
the
thermometer
and
we
had
nothing
to
mark
any
degrees
lower
than
below
zero
human
calculations
had
evidently
stopped
there
enormous
box
stoves
were
in
every
room
and
in
the
halls
the
sort
that
we
used
to
see
in
and
in
new
england
into
these
the
soldiers
stuffed
great
logs
of
mountain
mahogany
and
the
fires
were
kept
roaring
day
and
night
a
board
walk
ran
in
front
of
the
officers
quarters
and
desperate
for
fresh
air
and
exercise
some
of
the
ladies
would
bundle
up
and
go
to
walk
but
frozen
chins
ears
and
elbows
soon
made
this
undesirable
and
we
gave
up
trying
the
fresh
air
unless
the
mercury
rose
to
below
when
a
few
of
us
would
take
our
daily
promenade
we
could
not
complain
of
our
fare
however
for
our
larder
hung
full
of
all
sorts
of
delicate
and
delicious
things
brought
in
by
the
grangers
and
which
we
were
glad
to
buy
young
pigs
venison
and
ducks
all
hanging
to
be
used
when
desired
to
frappe
a
bottle
of
wine
we
stood
it
on
the
porch
in
a
few
minutes
it
would
pour
crystals
was
easy
but
keeping
warm
was
difficult
it
was
about
this
time
that
the
law
was
passed
abolishing
the
store
and
forbidding
the
selling
of
whiskey
to
soldiers
on
a
government
reservation
the
pleasant
canteen
or
post
exchange
the
soldiers
was
established
where
the
men
could
go
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
their
lives
with
the
abolition
of
whiskey
the
tone
of
the
post
improved
greatly
the
men
were
contented
with
a
glass
of
beer
or
light
wine
the
canteen
was
well
managed
so
the
profits
went
back
into
the
company
messes
in
the
shape
of
luxuries
heretofore
unknown
billiards
and
were
established
and
from
that
time
on
the
canteen
came
to
be
regarded
in
the
army
as
a
most
excellent
institution
the
men
gained
in
the
canteen
provided
them
with
a
place
where
they
could
go
and
take
a
bite
of
lunch
read
chat
smoke
or
play
games
with
their
own
chosen
friends
and
escape
the
lonesomeness
of
the
barracks
but
alas
this
condition
of
things
was
not
destined
to
endure
for
the
women
of
the
various
temperance
societies
in
their
mistaken
zeal
and
woeful
ignorance
of
the
soldiers
life
succeeded
in
influencing
legislation
to
such
an
extent
that
the
canteen
in
its
turn
was
abolished
with
what
dire
results
we
of
the
army
all
know
those
estimable
women
of
the
thought
to
do
good
to
the
army
no
doubt
but
through
their
pitiful
ignorance
of
the
soldiers
needs
they
have
done
him
an
incalculable
harm
let
them
stay
by
their
lectures
and
their
clubs
i
say
and
their
other
amusements
let
them
exercise
their
good
influences
nearer
home
with
a
class
of
people
whose
conditions
are
understood
by
them
where
they
can
no
doubt
do
worlds
of
good
they
can
not
know
the
drear
monotony
of
the
barracks
life
on
the
frontier
in
times
of
peace
i
have
lived
close
by
it
and
i
know
it
well
a
ceaseless
round
of
drill
and
work
and
lessons
and
work
and
lessons
and
drill
no
recreation
no
excitement
no
change
far
away
from
family
and
all
home
companionship
a
man
longs
for
some
pleasant
place
to
go
after
the
day
work
is
done
perhaps
these
women
think
if
in
their
blind
enthusiasm
they
think
at
all
that
a
young
soldier
or
an
old
soldier
needs
no
recreation
at
all
events
they
have
taken
from
him
the
only
one
he
had
the
good
old
canteen
and
given
him
nothing
in
return
now
fort
niobrara
was
a
large
post
there
were
ten
companies
cavalry
and
infantry
general
august
kautz
the
colonel
of
the
eighth
infantry
in
command
and
here
amidst
the
of
nebraska
we
first
began
to
really
know
our
colonel
a
man
of
strong
convictions
and
abiding
honesty
a
soldier
who
knew
his
profession
thoroughly
having
not
only
achieved
distinction
in
the
civil
war
but
having
served
when
little
more
than
a
boy
in
the
mexican
war
of
genial
in
his
manners
brave
and
kind
he
was
beloved
by
all
the
three
kautz
children
frankie
austin
and
navarra
were
the
inseparable
companions
of
our
own
children
there
was
a
small
school
for
the
children
of
the
post
and
a
soldier
by
the
name
of
delany
was
schoolmaster
he
tried
hard
to
make
our
children
learn
but
they
did
not
wish
to
study
and
spent
all
their
spare
time
in
planning
tricks
to
be
played
upon
poor
delany
it
was
a
difficult
situation
for
the
soldier
finally
the
two
oldest
kautz
children
were
sent
east
to
and
we
also
began
to
realize
that
something
must
be
done
our
surroundings
during
the
early
winter
it
is
true
had
been
dreary
enough
but
as
the
weather
softened
a
bit
and
the
spring
approached
the
post
began
to
wake
up
in
the
meantime
cupid
had
not
been
idle
it
was
observed
that
bingham
our
gracious
host
of
the
ninth
cavalry
had
fallen
in
love
with
antoinette
the
pretty
and
attractive
daughter
of
captain
lynch
of
our
own
regiment
and
the
post
began
to
be
on
the
qui
vive
to
see
how
the
affair
would
end
for
nobody
expects
to
see
the
course
of
true
love
run
smooth
in
their
case
however
the
fates
were
kind
and
in
due
time
the
happy
engagement
was
announced
we
had
an
excellent
amusement
hall
with
a
fine
floor
for
dancing
the
chapel
was
at
one
end
and
a
fairly
good
stage
was
at
the
other
being
nearer
civilization
now
in
the
state
of
nebraska
uncle
sam
provided
us
with
a
chaplain
and
a
weekly
service
was
held
by
the
anglican
clergyman
a
tall
man
a
scholar
and
as
we
say
a
gentleman
he
wore
the
uniform
of
the
army
chaplain
and
as
far
as
looks
went
could
hold
his
own
with
any
of
the
younger
officers
and
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
the
church
people
to
have
this
weekly
service
during
the
rest
of
the
time
the
chapel
was
concealed
by
heavy
curtains
and
the
seats
turned
around
facing
the
stage
we
had
a
good
string
orchestra
of
twenty
or
more
pieces
and
as
there
were
a
number
of
active
young
bachelors
at
the
post
a
series
of
weekly
dances
was
inaugurated
never
did
i
enjoy
dancing
more
than
at
this
time
then
kautz
who
was
a
thorough
music
lover
and
had
a
cultivated
taste
as
well
as
a
trained
and
exquisite
voice
gave
several
musicales
for
which
much
preparation
was
made
and
which
were
most
delightful
these
were
given
at
the
quarters
of
general
kautz
a
long
low
rambling
house
arranged
with
that
artistic
taste
for
which
kautz
was
distinguished
then
came
theatricals
all
managed
by
kautz
whose
talents
were
versatile
we
charged
admission
for
we
needed
some
more
scenery
and
the
neighboring
frontier
town
of
valentine
came
riding
and
driving
over
the
prairie
and
across
the
old
bridge
of
the
niobrara
river
to
see
our
plays
we
had
a
stage
our
methods
were
primitive
as
there
was
no
gas
or
electricity
there
in
those
days
but
the
results
were
good
and
the
histrionic
ability
shown
by
some
of
our
young
men
and
women
seemed
marvellous
to
us
i
remember
especially
bob
emmet
acting
which
moved
me
to
tears
in
a
most
pathetic
love
scene
i
thought
what
has
the
stage
lost
in
this
gifted
man
but
he
is
of
a
family
whose
talents
are
well
known
and
his
personality
no
doubt
added
much
to
his
natural
ability
as
an
actor
neither
the
army
nor
the
stage
can
now
claim
this
brilliant
cavalry
officer
as
he
was
induced
by
urgent
family
reasons
shortly
after
the
period
of
which
i
am
writing
to
resign
his
commission
and
retire
to
private
life
at
the
very
height
of
his
ambitious
career
and
now
the
summer
came
on
apace
a
was
made
and
added
greatly
to
our
amusement
we
were
in
the
saddle
every
day
and
the
country
around
proved
very
attractive
at
this
season
both
for
riding
and
driving
but
all
this
gayety
did
not
content
me
for
the
serious
question
of
education
for
our
children
now
presented
itself
the
question
which
sooner
or
later
presents
itself
to
the
minds
of
all
the
parents
of
army
children
it
is
settled
differently
by
different
people
it
had
taken
a
year
for
us
to
decide
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
take
the
children
east
and
then
decide
on
schools
afterwards
so
our
plans
were
completed
and
the
day
of
departure
fixed
upon
jack
was
to
remain
at
the
post
about
an
hour
before
i
was
to
leave
i
saw
the
members
of
the
string
orchestra
filing
across
the
parade
ground
coming
directly
towards
our
quarters
my
heart
began
to
beat
faster
as
i
realized
that
kautz
had
planned
a
serenade
for
me
i
felt
it
was
a
great
break
in
my
army
life
but
i
did
not
know
i
was
leaving
the
old
regiment
forever
the
regiment
with
which
i
had
been
associated
for
so
many
years
and
as
i
listened
to
the
beautiful
strains
of
the
music
i
loved
so
well
my
eyes
were
wet
with
tears
and
after
all
the
goodbye
were
said
to
the
officers
and
their
wives
my
friends
who
had
shared
all
our
joys
and
our
sorrows
in
so
many
places
and
under
so
many
conditions
i
ran
out
to
the
stable
and
pressed
my
cheek
against
the
soft
warm
noses
of
our
two
saddle
horses
i
felt
that
life
was
over
for
me
and
nothing
but
work
and
care
remained
i
say
i
felt
all
this
it
must
have
been
premonition
for
i
had
no
idea
that
i
was
leaving
the
line
of
the
army
forever
the
ambulance
was
at
the
door
to
take
us
to
valentine
where
i
bade
jack
good
bye
and
took
the
train
for
the
east
his
last
promise
was
to
visit
us
once
a
year
or
whenever
he
could
get
a
leave
of
absence
my
husband
had
now
worn
the
single
bar
on
his
for
eleven
years
or
more
before
that
the
straps
of
the
second
lieutenant
had
adorned
his
broad
shoulders
for
a
period
quite
as
long
years
a
lieutenant
in
the
regular
army
after
fighting
in
a
volunteer
regiment
of
his
own
state
through
the
four
years
of
the
civil
war
the
gallant
and
meritorious
service
for
which
he
had
received
brevets
seemed
indeed
to
have
been
forgotten
he
had
grown
grey
in
indian
campaigns
and
it
looked
as
if
the
frontier
might
always
be
the
home
of
the
senior
lieutenant
of
the
old
eighth
promotion
in
that
regiment
had
been
at
a
standstill
for
years
being
in
washington
for
a
short
time
towards
enjoying
the
social
side
of
military
life
at
the
capital
an
opportunity
came
to
me
to
meet
president
cleveland
and
although
his
administration
was
nearing
its
close
and
the
stress
of
official
cares
was
very
great
he
seemed
to
have
leisure
and
interest
to
ask
me
about
my
life
on
the
frontier
and
as
the
conversation
became
quite
personal
the
impulse
seized
me
to
tell
him
just
how
i
felt
about
the
education
of
our
children
and
then
to
tell
him
what
i
thought
and
what
others
thought
about
the
unjust
way
in
which
the
promotions
and
retirements
in
our
regiment
had
been
managed
he
listened
with
the
greatest
interest
and
seemed
pleased
with
my
frankness
he
asked
me
what
the
soldiers
and
officers
out
there
thought
of
so
and
so
they
hate
him
i
said
whereupon
he
laughed
outright
and
i
knew
i
had
committed
an
indiscretion
but
life
on
the
frontier
does
not
teach
one
diplomacy
of
speech
and
by
that
time
i
was
nerved
up
to
say
just
what
i
felt
regardless
of
results
well
he
said
smiling
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
interfere
much
with
those
military
matters
then
pointing
with
his
left
hand
and
thumb
towards
the
war
department
they
fix
them
all
up
over
there
in
the
adjutant
general
office
he
added
then
he
asked
me
many
more
questions
if
i
had
always
stayed
out
there
with
my
husband
and
why
i
did
not
live
in
the
east
as
so
many
army
women
did
and
all
the
time
i
could
hear
the
dull
thud
of
the
carpenters
hammers
for
they
were
building
even
then
the
board
seats
for
the
public
who
would
witness
the
inaugural
ceremonies
of
his
successor
and
with
each
stroke
of
the
hammer
his
face
seemed
to
grow
more
sad
i
felt
the
greatness
of
the
man
his
desire
to
be
just
and
good
his
marvellous
personal
power
his
ability
to
understand
and
to
sympathize
and
when
i
parted
from
him
he
said
again
laughingly
well
i
shall
not
forget
your
husband
regiment
and
if
anything
turns
up
for
those
fine
men
you
have
told
me
about
they
will
hear
from
me
and
i
knew
they
were
the
words
of
a
man
who
meant
what
he
said
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
he
had
asked
who
are
these
men
do
they
ever
come
to
washington
i
rarely
have
these
things
explained
to
me
and
i
have
little
time
to
interfere
with
the
decisions
of
the
adjutant
general
office
i
replied
no
president
they
are
not
the
men
you
see
around
washington
our
regiment
stays
on
the
frontier
and
these
men
are
the
ones
who
do
the
fighting
and
you
people
here
in
washington
are
apt
to
forget
all
about
them
what
have
they
ever
done
were
they
in
the
civil
war
he
asked
their
records
stand
in
black
and
white
in
the
war
department
i
replied
if
you
have
the
interest
to
learn
more
about
them
women
opinions
are
influenced
by
their
feelings
he
said
mine
are
based
upon
what
i
know
and
i
am
prepared
to
stand
by
my
convictions
i
replied
soon
after
this
interview
i
returned
to
new
york
and
i
did
not
give
the
matter
very
much
further
thought
but
my
impression
of
the
greatness
of
cleveland
and
of
his
powerful
personality
has
remained
with
me
to
this
day
a
vacancy
occurred
about
this
time
in
the
quartermaster
department
and
the
appointment
was
eagerly
sought
for
by
many
lieutenants
of
the
army
president
cleveland
saw
fit
to
give
the
appointment
to
lieutenant
summerhayes
making
him
a
captain
and
quartermaster
and
then
another
vacancy
occurring
shortly
after
he
appointed
lieutenant
john
mcewen
hyde
to
be
also
a
captain
and
quartermaster
lieutenant
hyde
stood
next
in
rank
to
my
husband
and
had
grown
grey
in
the
old
eighth
infantry
so
the
regiment
came
in
for
its
honor
at
last
and
general
kautz
when
the
news
of
the
second
appointment
reached
him
exclaimed
well
well
does
the
president
think
my
regiment
a
nursery
for
the
staff
the
eighth
foot
and
the
ninth
horse
at
niobrara
gave
the
new
captain
and
quartermaster
a
rousing
farewell
for
now
my
husband
was
leaving
his
old
regiment
forever
and
while
he
appreciated
fully
the
honor
of
his
new
staff
position
he
felt
a
sadness
at
breaking
off
the
associations
of
so
many
years
a
sadness
which
can
scarcely
be
understood
by
the
young
officers
of
the
present
day
who
are
promoted
from
one
regiment
to
another
and
rarely
remain
long
enough
with
one
organization
to
know
even
the
men
of
their
own
company
there
were
many
champagne
suppers
dinners
and
given
for
him
to
make
the
something
to
be
remembered
and
at
the
end
of
a
week
festivities
he
departed
by
a
night
train
from
valentine
thus
eluding
the
hospitality
of
those
generous
but
wild
frontiersmen
who
were
waiting
to
give
him
what
they
call
out
there
a
for
valentine
was
like
all
frontier
towns
a
row
of
stores
and
saloons
the
men
who
kept
them
were
generous
if
somewhat
rough
one
of
the
officers
of
the
post
having
occasion
to
go
to
the
railroad
station
one
day
at
valentine
saw
the
body
of
a
man
hanging
to
a
telegraph
pole
a
short
distance
up
the
track
he
said
to
the
station
man
what
does
that
mean
nodding
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
telegraph
pole
why
it
means
just
this
said
the
station
man
the
people
who
hung
that
man
last
night
had
the
nerve
to
put
him
right
in
front
of
this
place
by
g
what
would
the
passengers
think
of
this
town
sir
as
they
went
by
why
the
reputation
of
valentine
would
be
ruined
yes
sir
we
cut
him
down
and
moved
him
up
a
pole
or
two
he
was
a
hard
case
though
he
added
chapter
xxxi
santa
fe
i
made
haste
to
present
captain
summerhayes
with
the
of
his
new
rank
when
he
joined
me
in
new
york
the
orders
for
santa
fe
reached
us
in
at
nantucket
i
knew
about
as
much
of
santa
fe
as
the
average
american
knows
and
that
was
nothing
but
i
did
know
that
the
staff
appointment
solved
the
problem
of
education
for
us
for
staff
officers
are
usually
stationed
in
cities
and
i
knew
that
our
frontier
life
was
over
i
welcomed
the
change
for
our
children
were
getting
older
and
we
were
ourselves
approaching
the
age
when
comfort
means
more
to
one
than
it
heretofore
has
jack
obeyed
his
sudden
orders
and
i
followed
him
as
soon
as
possible
arriving
at
santa
fe
in
the
mellow
sunlight
of
an
october
day
we
were
met
by
my
husband
and
an
officer
of
the
tenth
infantry
and
as
we
drove
into
the
town
its
appearance
of
placid
content
its
ancient
buildings
its
great
trees
its
clear
air
its
friendly
inhabitants
gave
me
a
delightful
feeling
of
home
a
mysterious
charm
seemed
to
possess
me
it
was
the
spell
which
that
old
town
loves
to
throw
over
the
strangers
who
venture
off
the
beaten
track
to
come
within
her
walls
lying
only
eighteen
miles
away
over
a
small
branch
road
from
llamy
a
station
on
the
atchison
and
topeka
railroad
few
people
take
the
trouble
to
stop
over
to
visit
it
dead
old
town
says
the
commercial
traveller
nothing
doing
there
and
it
is
true
but
no
spot
that
i
have
visited
in
this
country
has
thrown
around
me
the
spell
of
enchantment
which
held
me
fast
in
that
sleepy
and
historic
town
the
governor
palace
the
old
plaza
the
ancient
churches
the
antiquated
customs
the
sisters
hospital
the
old
convent
of
our
lady
of
loretto
the
soft
music
of
the
spanish
tongue
i
loved
them
all
there
were
no
factories
no
noise
was
ever
heard
the
sun
shone
peacefully
on
through
winter
and
summer
alike
there
was
no
cold
no
heat
but
a
delightful
climate
why
the
place
was
not
crowded
with
health
seekers
was
a
puzzle
to
me
i
had
thought
that
the
bay
of
san
francisco
offered
the
most
agreeable
climate
in
america
but
in
the
territory
of
new
mexico
santa
fe
was
the
perfection
of
all
climates
combined
the
old
city
lies
in
the
broad
valley
of
the
santa
fe
creek
but
the
valley
of
the
santa
fe
creek
lies
seven
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
level
i
should
never
have
known
that
we
were
living
at
a
great
altitude
if
i
had
not
been
told
for
the
equable
climate
made
us
forget
to
inquire
about
height
or
depth
or
distance
i
listened
to
old
father
de
fourri
preach
his
short
sermons
in
english
to
the
few
americans
who
sat
on
one
side
of
the
aisle
in
the
church
of
our
lady
of
guadaloupe
then
turning
with
an
easy
gesture
towards
his
mexican
congregation
who
sat
or
knelt
near
the
sanctuary
and
saying
hermanos
mios
he
gave
the
same
discourse
in
good
spanish
i
felt
comfortable
in
the
thought
that
i
was
improving
my
spanish
as
well
as
profiting
by
father
de
fourri
sound
logic
this
good
priest
had
grown
old
at
santa
fe
in
the
service
of
his
church
the
mexican
women
with
their
black
ribosos
wound
around
their
heads
and
concealing
their
faces
knelt
during
the
entire
mass
and
made
many
long
responses
in
latin
after
years
spent
in
a
heathenish
manner
as
regards
all
church
observations
this
devout
and
unique
service
following
the
customs
of
ancient
spain
was
interesting
to
me
in
the
extreme
sometimes
on
a
sunday
afternoon
i
attended
vespers
in
the
chapel
of
the
sisters
hospital
as
it
was
called
a
fine
sanitarium
managed
entirely
by
the
roman
catholic
sisters
of
charity
sister
victoria
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
management
was
not
only
a
very
beautiful
woman
but
she
had
an
agreeable
voice
and
always
led
in
the
singing
it
seemed
like
heaven
i
wrote
to
my
friends
in
the
east
to
come
to
the
sisters
hospital
if
they
wanted
health
peace
and
happiness
for
it
was
surely
to
be
found
there
i
visited
the
convent
of
our
lady
of
loretto
i
stood
before
a
high
wall
in
an
embrasure
of
which
there
was
a
low
wooden
gate
i
pulled
on
a
small
knotted
string
which
hung
out
of
a
little
hole
and
a
queer
old
bell
rang
then
one
of
the
nuns
came
and
let
me
in
across
a
beautiful
garden
to
the
convent
school
i
placed
my
little
daughter
as
a
day
pupil
there
as
she
was
now
eleven
years
old
the
nuns
spoke
very
little
english
and
the
children
none
at
all
the
entire
city
was
ancient
spanish
catholic
steeped
in
a
religious
atmosphere
and
in
what
the
average
american
protestant
would
call
the
superstitions
of
the
dark
ages
there
were
endless
fiestas
and
processions
and
religious
services
i
saw
them
all
and
became
much
interested
in
reading
the
history
of
the
catholic
missions
established
so
early
out
through
what
was
then
a
wild
and
unexplored
country
after
that
i
listened
with
renewed
interest
to
old
father
de
fouri
who
had
tended
and
led
his
flock
of
simple
people
so
long
and
so
lovingly
there
was
a
large
painting
of
our
lady
of
guadaloupe
over
the
altar
these
people
firmly
believed
that
she
had
appeared
to
them
on
the
earth
and
so
strong
was
the
influence
around
me
that
i
began
almost
to
believe
it
too
i
never
missed
the
sunday
morning
mass
and
i
fell
in
easily
with
the
religious
observances
i
read
and
studied
about
the
old
explorers
and
i
seemed
to
live
in
the
time
of
cortez
and
his
brave
band
i
became
acquainted
with
adolf
bandelier
who
had
lived
for
years
in
that
country
engaged
in
research
for
the
american
archaeological
society
i
visited
the
indian
pueblos
those
marvellous
structures
of
adobe
where
live
entire
tribes
and
saw
natives
who
have
not
changed
their
manner
of
speech
or
dress
since
the
days
when
the
spaniards
first
penetrated
to
their
curious
dwellings
three
hundred
or
more
years
ago
i
climbed
the
rickety
ladders
by
which
one
enters
these
strange
dwellings
and
bought
the
great
bowls
which
these
indians
shape
in
some
manner
without
the
assistance
of
a
wheel
and
then
bake
in
their
mud
ovens
the
pueblo
of
tesuque
is
only
nine
miles
from
santa
fe
and
a
pleasant
drive
at
that
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
the
road
was
not
lined
with
tourists
but
no
they
pass
all
these
wonders
by
in
their
disinclination
to
go
off
the
beaten
track
visiting
the
pueblos
gets
to
be
a
craze
governor
and
mrs
prince
knew
them
all
the
pueblo
of
taos
of
santa
clara
san
juan
and
others
and
the
governor
collection
of
great
stone
idols
was
a
marvel
indeed
he
kept
them
laid
out
on
shelves
which
resembled
the
bunks
on
a
great
vessel
and
in
an
apartment
especially
reserved
for
them
in
his
residence
at
santa
fe
and
it
was
always
with
considerable
awe
that
i
entered
that
apartment
the
governor
occupied
at
that
time
a
low
rambling
adobe
house
on
palace
avenue
and
this
with
its
thick
walls
and
low
made
a
fit
setting
for
the
treasures
they
had
gathered
later
on
the
governor
family
occupied
the
palace
as
it
is
always
called
of
the
old
spanish
viceroy
a
most
ancient
picturesque
yet
dignified
building
facing
the
plaza
the
various
apartments
in
this
old
palace
were
used
for
government
offices
when
we
were
stationed
there
in
and
in
one
of
these
rooms
general
lew
wallace
a
few
years
before
had
written
his
famous
book
ben
hur
on
the
walls
were
hanging
old
portraits
painted
by
the
spaniards
in
the
sixteenth
century
they
were
done
on
rawhide
and
whether
these
interesting
and
historic
pictures
have
been
preserved
by
our
government
i
do
not
know
the
distinguished
anglican
clergyman
living
there
taught
a
small
class
of
boys
and
the
academy
an
excellent
school
established
by
the
presbyterian
board
of
missions
afforded
good
advantages
for
the
young
girls
of
the
garrison
and
as
we
had
found
that
the
convent
of
loretto
was
not
just
adapted
to
the
education
of
an
american
child
we
withdrew
katharine
from
that
school
and
placed
her
at
the
presbyterian
academy
to
be
sure
the
young
woman
teacher
gave
a
rousing
lecture
on
total
abstinence
once
a
week
going
even
so
far
as
to
say
that
to
partake
of
apple
sauce
which
had
begun
to
ferment
was
yielding
to
the
temptations
of
satan
the
young
woman
arguments
made
a
disastrous
impression
upon
our
children
minds
so
much
so
that
the
rich
german
jews
whose
daughters
attended
the
school
complained
greatly
for
as
they
told
us
these
girls
would
hasten
to
snatch
the
decanters
from
the
sideboard
at
the
approach
of
visitors
and
hide
them
and
they
began
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
their
elders
now
these
men
were
among
the
leading
citizens
of
the
town
they
were
and
wealthy
they
could
not
stand
these
extreme
doctrines
so
opposed
to
their
life
and
their
traditions
we
informed
miss
one
day
that
she
could
excuse
our
children
from
the
total
abstinence
lecture
or
we
should
be
compelled
to
withdraw
them
from
the
school
she
said
she
could
not
compel
them
to
listen
but
preach
she
must
she
remained
obedient
to
her
orders
from
the
board
and
we
could
but
respect
her
for
that
our
young
daughters
were
however
excused
from
the
lecture
but
our
time
was
not
entirely
given
up
to
the
study
of
ancient
pottery
for
the
social
life
there
was
delightful
the
garrison
was
in
the
centre
of
the
town
the
houses
were
comfortable
and
the
streets
shaded
by
old
trees
the
tenth
infantry
had
its
headquarters
and
two
companies
there
every
afternoon
the
military
band
played
in
the
plaza
where
everybody
went
and
sat
on
benches
in
the
shade
of
the
old
trees
or
if
cool
in
the
delightful
sunshine
the
pretty
and
senoritas
cast
shy
glances
at
the
young
officers
of
the
tenth
but
alas
the
handsome
and
attractive
lieutenants
van
vliet
and
seyburn
and
the
more
sedate
lieutenant
plummer
could
not
return
these
bewitching
glances
as
they
were
all
settled
in
life
the
two
former
officers
had
married
in
detroit
and
both
van
vliet
and
seyburn
did
honor
to
the
beautiful
city
of
michigan
for
they
were
most
agreeable
and
clever
women
and
presided
over
their
army
homes
with
distinguished
grace
and
hospitality
the
americans
who
lived
there
were
all
professional
people
mostly
lawyers
and
a
few
bankers
i
could
not
understand
why
so
many
eastern
lawyers
lived
there
i
afterwards
learned
that
the
old
spanish
land
grants
had
given
rise
to
illimitable
and
litigation
every
morning
we
rode
across
country
there
were
no
fences
but
the
wide
irrigation
ditches
gave
us
a
plenty
of
excitement
and
the
riding
was
glorious
i
had
no
occasion
yet
to
realize
that
we
had
left
the
line
of
the
army
a
camping
trip
to
the
of
the
pecos
where
we
caught
speckled
trout
in
great
abundance
in
the
foaming
riffles
and
shallow
pools
of
this
rushing
mountain
stream
remaining
in
camp
a
week
under
the
spreading
boughs
of
the
mighty
pines
added
to
the
variety
and
delights
of
our
life
there
with
such
an
existence
as
this
good
health
and
diversion
the
time
passed
rapidly
by
it
was
against
the
law
now
for
soldiers
to
marry
the
old
days
of
laundresses
had
passed
away
but
the
trombone
player
of
the
tenth
infantry
band
a
young
boston
boy
had
married
a
wife
and
now
a
baby
had
come
to
them
they
could
get
no
quarters
so
we
took
the
family
in
and
as
the
wife
was
an
excellent
cook
we
were
able
to
give
many
small
dinners
the
walls
of
the
house
being
three
feet
thick
we
were
never
troubled
by
the
trombone
practice
or
the
infant
cries
and
many
a
delightful
evening
we
had
around
the
board
with
father
de
fourri
rev
meany
the
anglican
clergyman
the
officers
and
ladies
of
the
tenth
governor
and
mrs
prince
and
the
brilliant
lawyer
folk
of
santa
fe
such
an
ideal
life
can
not
last
long
this
existence
of
ours
does
not
seem
to
be
contrived
on
those
lines
at
the
end
of
a
year
orders
came
for
texas
and
perhaps
it
was
well
that
orders
came
or
we
might
be
in
santa
fe
wrapt
in
a
dream
of
past
ages
for
the
city
of
the
holy
faith
had
bound
us
with
invisible
chains
with
our
departure
from
santa
fe
all
picturesqueness
came
to
an
end
in
our
army
life
ever
after
that
we
had
really
good
houses
to
live
in
which
had
all
modern
arrangements
we
had
beautiful
lawns
and
gardens
the
same
sort
of
domestic
service
that
civilians
have
and
lived
almost
the
same
life
chapter
xxxii
texas
whenever
i
think
of
san
antonio
and
fort
sam
houston
the
perfume
of
the
wood
violet
which
blossomed
in
along
the
borders
of
our
lawn
and
the
delicate
odor
of
the
cape
jessamine
seem
to
be
wafted
about
me
fort
sam
houston
is
the
headquarters
of
the
department
of
texas
and
all
the
staff
officers
live
there
in
comfortable
stone
houses
with
broad
lawns
shaded
by
chinaberry
trees
then
at
the
top
of
the
hill
is
a
great
quadrangle
with
a
clock
tower
and
all
the
department
offices
on
the
other
side
of
this
quadrangle
is
the
post
where
the
line
officers
live
general
stanley
commanded
the
department
a
fine
dignified
and
able
man
with
a
great
record
as
an
indian
fighter
jack
knew
him
well
as
he
had
been
with
him
in
the
first
preliminary
survey
for
the
northern
pacific
railroad
when
he
drove
old
sitting
bull
back
to
the
powder
river
he
was
now
about
to
reach
the
age
of
retirement
and
as
the
day
approached
that
day
when
a
man
has
reached
the
limit
of
his
usefulness
in
the
opinion
of
an
government
that
day
which
sounds
the
knell
of
active
service
that
day
so
dreaded
and
yet
so
longed
for
that
day
when
an
army
officer
is
years
old
and
uncle
sam
lays
him
upon
the
shelf
as
that
day
approached
the
city
of
san
antonio
in
fact
the
entire
state
of
texas
poured
forth
to
bid
him
godspeed
for
if
ever
an
army
man
was
beloved
it
was
general
stanley
by
the
state
of
texas
now
on
the
other
side
of
the
great
quadrangle
lay
the
post
where
were
the
soldiers
barracks
and
quarters
of
the
line
officers
this
was
commanded
by
colonel
coppinger
a
gallant
officer
who
had
fought
in
many
wars
in
many
countries
he
had
his
famous
regiment
the
infantry
and
many
were
the
pleasant
dances
and
theatricals
we
had
with
the
music
furnished
by
their
band
for
as
it
was
a
time
of
peace
the
troops
were
all
in
garrison
major
burbank
was
there
also
with
his
light
battery
of
the
artillery
my
husband
being
a
captain
and
quartermaster
served
directly
under
general
george
weeks
who
was
chief
quartermaster
of
the
department
and
i
can
never
forget
his
kindness
to
us
both
he
was
one
of
the
best
men
i
ever
knew
in
the
army
or
out
of
it
and
came
to
be
one
of
my
dearest
friends
he
possessed
the
sturdy
qualities
of
his
puritan
ancestry
united
with
the
charming
manners
of
an
aristocrat
we
belonged
of
course
now
with
the
staff
and
something
an
intangible
something
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
the
life
the
officers
were
all
older
and
the
staff
uniforms
were
more
sombre
i
missed
the
white
stripe
of
the
infantry
and
the
yellow
of
the
cavalry
the
all
had
gold
eagles
or
leaves
on
them
instead
of
the
captains
or
lieutenants
bars
many
of
the
staff
officers
wore
civilians
clothes
which
distressed
me
much
and
i
used
to
tell
them
that
if
i
were
secretary
of
war
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
go
about
in
black
alpaca
coats
and
trousers
what
would
you
have
us
do
said
general
weeks
wear
white
duck
and
brass
buttons
i
replied
said
the
and
erect
chief
quartermaster
you
would
have
us
be
as
vain
as
we
were
when
we
were
lieutenants
you
can
afford
to
be
i
answered
for
even
with
his
threescore
years
he
had
retained
the
lines
of
youth
and
was
in
my
opinion
the
finest
looking
man
in
the
staff
of
the
army
but
all
my
reproaches
and
all
my
diplomacy
were
of
no
avail
in
reforming
the
staff
evidently
comfort
and
not
looks
was
their
motto
one
day
i
accidentally
caught
a
side
view
of
myself
in
a
long
mirror
long
mirrors
had
not
been
very
plentiful
on
the
frontier
and
was
appalled
by
the
fact
that
my
own
lines
corresponded
but
too
well
alas
with
those
of
the
staff
ah
me
were
the
days
then
of
lieutenants
forever
past
and
gone
the
days
of
suppleness
and
youth
the
careless
gay
days
when
there
was
no
thought
for
the
future
no
anxiety
about
education
when
the
day
began
with
a
wild
dash
across
country
and
ended
with
a
dinner
and
dance
they
over
then
for
us
all
major
burbank
battery
of
light
artillery
came
over
and
enlivened
the
quiet
of
our
post
occasionally
with
their
brilliant
red
color
at
those
times
we
all
went
out
and
stood
in
the
music
pavilion
to
watch
the
drill
and
when
his
horses
and
guns
and
caissons
thundered
down
the
hill
and
swept
by
us
at
a
terrific
gallop
our
hearts
stood
still
even
the
dignified
staff
permitted
themselves
a
thrill
and
as
for
us
women
our
excitement
knew
no
bounds
the
brilliant
red
of
the
artillery
brought
color
to
the
rather
grey
aspect
of
the
quiet
headquarters
post
and
the
magnificent
drill
supplied
the
martial
element
so
dear
to
a
woman
heart
in
san
antonio
the
new
has
almost
obliterated
the
old
and
little
remains
except
its
pretty
green
river
its
picturesque
bridges
and
the
historic
alamo
to
mark
it
from
other
cities
in
the
southwest
in
the
late
afternoon
everybody
drove
to
the
plaza
where
all
the
country
people
were
selling
their
and
poultry
in
the
open
square
this
was
charming
and
we
all
bought
live
fowl
and
drove
home
again
one
heard
cackling
and
gobbling
from
the
smart
traps
and
victorias
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
survival
of
an
old
custom
the
whole
town
took
a
drive
after
that
and
supped
at
eight
the
san
antonio
people
believe
there
is
no
climate
to
equal
theirs
and
talk
much
about
the
cool
breezes
from
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
is
some
miles
away
but
i
found
seven
months
of
the
twelve
too
hot
for
comfort
and
i
could
never
detect
much
coolness
in
the
summer
breezes
after
i
settled
down
to
the
sedateness
which
is
supposed
to
belong
to
the
staff
i
began
to
enjoy
life
very
much
there
is
compensation
for
every
loss
and
i
found
with
the
new
friends
many
of
whom
had
lived
their
lives
and
had
known
sorrow
and
joy
a
true
companionship
which
enriched
my
life
and
filled
the
days
with
gladness
my
son
had
completed
the
high
school
course
in
san
antonio
under
an
able
german
master
and
had
been
sent
east
to
prepare
for
the
stevens
institute
of
technology
and
in
the
following
spring
i
took
my
daughter
katharine
and
fled
from
the
dreaded
heat
of
a
texas
summer
never
can
i
forget
the
child
grief
on
parting
from
her
texas
pony
she
extorted
a
solemn
promise
from
her
father
who
was
obliged
to
stay
in
texas
that
he
would
never
part
with
him
my
brother
then
unmarried
and
my
sister
harriet
were
living
together
in
new
rochelle
and
to
them
we
went
harry
vacation
enabled
him
to
be
with
us
and
we
had
a
delightful
summer
it
was
good
to
be
on
the
shores
of
long
island
sound
in
the
autumn
not
knowing
what
next
was
in
store
for
us
i
placed
my
dear
little
katharine
at
the
convent
of
the
sacred
heart
at
kenwood
on
the
hudson
that
she
might
be
able
to
complete
her
education
in
one
place
and
in
the
care
of
those
lovely
gentle
and
refined
ladies
of
that
order
shortly
after
that
captain
jack
was
ordered
to
david
island
new
york
harbor
now
called
fort
slocum
where
we
spent
four
happy
and
uninterrupted
years
in
the
most
constant
intercourse
with
my
dear
brother
and
sister
old
friends
were
coming
and
going
all
the
time
and
it
seemed
so
good
to
us
to
be
living
in
a
place
where
this
was
possible
captain
summerhayes
was
constructing
officer
and
had
a
busy
life
with
all
the
various
sorts
of
building
to
be
done
there
david
island
was
then
an
artillery
post
and
there
were
several
batteries
stationed
there
afterwards
it
became
a
recruiting
station
the
garrison
was
often
entirely
changed
at
one
time
general
henry
cook
was
in
command
he
and
his
charming
southern
wife
added
so
much
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
post
then
came
our
old
friends
the
van
vliets
of
santa
fe
days
and
and
valery
havard
who
are
so
well
known
in
the
army
and
then
colonel
carl
woodruff
and
woodruff
whom
we
all
liked
so
much
and
dear
doctor
julian
cabell
and
others
who
completed
a
delightful
garrison
and
we
had
a
series
of
informal
dances
and
invited
the
distinguished
members
of
the
artist
colony
from
new
rochelle
and
it
was
at
one
of
these
dances
that
i
first
met
frederic
remington
i
had
long
admired
his
work
and
had
been
most
anxious
to
meet
him
as
a
rule
frederic
did
not
attend
any
social
functions
but
he
loved
the
army
and
as
remington
was
fond
of
social
life
they
were
both
present
at
our
first
little
invitation
dance
about
the
middle
of
the
evening
i
noticed
remington
sitting
alone
and
i
crossed
the
hall
and
sat
down
beside
him
i
then
told
him
how
much
i
had
loved
his
work
and
how
it
appealed
to
all
army
folks
and
how
glad
i
was
to
know
him
and
i
suppose
i
said
many
other
things
such
as
literary
men
and
painters
and
players
often
have
to
hear
from
enthusiastic
women
like
myself
however
frederic
seemed
pleased
and
made
some
modest
little
speech
and
then
fell
into
an
abstracted
silence
gazing
on
the
great
flag
which
was
stretched
across
the
hall
at
one
end
and
from
behind
which
some
few
soldiers
who
were
going
to
assist
in
serving
the
supper
were
passing
in
and
out
i
fell
in
with
his
mood
immediately
as
he
was
a
person
with
whom
formality
was
impossible
and
said
what
are
you
looking
at
mr
remington
he
replied
turning
upon
me
his
round
boyish
face
and
his
blue
eyes
gladdening
i
was
just
thinking
i
wished
i
was
behind
in
there
where
those
blue
jackets
are
you
know
behind
that
flag
with
the
soldiers
those
are
the
men
i
like
to
study
you
know
i
do
like
all
this
fuss
and
feathers
of
society
then
blushing
at
his
lack
of
gallantry
he
added
it
all
right
of
course
pretty
women
and
all
that
and
i
suppose
you
think
dreadful
and
do
you
want
me
to
dance
with
you
that
the
proper
thing
here
is
it
whereupon
he
seized
me
in
his
great
arms
and
whirled
me
around
at
a
pace
i
never
dreamed
of
and
once
around
he
said
enough
of
this
thing
is
it
let
sit
down
i
believe
i
going
to
like
you
though
i
not
much
for
women
i
said
you
must
come
over
here
often
and
he
replied
you
got
a
lot
of
jolly
good
fellows
over
here
and
i
will
do
it
afterwards
the
remingtons
and
ourselves
became
the
closest
friends
remington
maiden
name
was
eva
caton
and
after
the
first
few
meetings
she
became
little
eva
to
me
and
if
ever
there
was
an
embodiment
of
that
gentle
lovely
name
and
what
it
implies
it
is
this
woman
the
wife
of
the
great
artist
who
has
stood
by
him
through
all
the
reverses
of
his
early
life
and
been
in
every
sense
his
guiding
star
and
now
began
visits
to
the
studio
a
great
room
he
had
built
on
to
his
house
at
new
rochelle
it
had
an
enormous
fire
place
where
great
logs
were
burned
and
the
walls
were
hung
with
the
most
rare
and
wonderful
indian
curios
there
he
did
all
the
painting
which
has
made
him
famous
in
the
last
twenty
years
and
all
the
modelling
which
has
already
become
so
well
known
and
would
have
eventually
made
him
a
name
as
a
great
sculptor
he
always
worked
steadily
until
three
and
then
there
was
a
walk
or
game
of
tennis
or
a
ride
after
dinner
delightful
evenings
in
the
studio
frederic
was
a
student
and
a
deep
thinker
he
liked
to
solve
all
questions
for
himself
and
did
not
accept
readily
other
men
theories
he
thought
much
on
religious
subjects
and
the
future
life
and
liked
to
compare
the
christian
religion
with
the
religions
of
eastern
countries
weighing
them
one
against
the
other
with
fairness
and
clear
logic
and
so
we
sat
many
evenings
into
the
night
frederic
and
jack
stretched
in
their
big
leather
chairs
puffing
away
at
their
pipes
eva
with
her
needlework
and
myself
a
rapt
listener
wondering
at
this
man
of
genius
who
could
work
with
his
creative
brush
all
day
long
and
talk
with
the
eloquence
of
a
learned
doctor
of
divinity
half
the
night
during
the
time
we
were
stationed
at
davids
island
remington
and
jack
made
a
trip
to
the
southwest
where
they
shot
the
peccary
wild
hog
in
texas
and
afterwards
blue
quail
and
other
game
in
mexico
artist
and
soldier
they
got
on
famously
together
notwithstanding
the
difference
in
their
ages
and
now
he
was
going
to
try
his
hand
at
a
novel
a
real
romance
we
talked
a
good
deal
about
the
little
indian
boy
and
i
got
to
love
white
weasel
long
before
he
appeared
in
print
as
john
ermine
the
book
came
out
after
we
had
left
new
rochelle
but
i
received
a
copy
from
him
and
wrote
him
my
opinion
of
it
which
was
one
of
unstinted
praise
but
it
did
not
surprise
me
to
learn
that
he
did
not
consider
it
a
success
from
a
financial
point
of
view
you
see
he
said
a
year
afterwards
that
sort
of
thing
does
not
interest
the
public
what
they
want
here
he
began
to
mimic
some
funny
old
east
side
person
and
both
hands
gesticulating
is
a
back
yard
and
a
cabbage
patch
and
a
cook
stove
and
babies
clothes
drying
beside
it
you
see
mattie
he
said
they
do
want
to
know
anything
about
the
indian
or
the
or
what
he
thinks
or
believes
and
then
he
went
off
into
one
of
his
irresistible
tirades
combining
ridicule
and
abuse
of
the
reading
public
in
language
such
as
only
frederic
remington
could
use
before
women
and
still
retain
his
dignity
well
frederic
i
said
i
will
try
to
recollect
that
when
i
write
my
experiences
of
army
life
in
writing
him
my
opinion
of
his
book
the
year
before
i
had
said
in
fact
i
am
in
love
with
john
ermine
the
following
christmas
he
sent
me
the
accompanying
card
now
the
book
was
dramatized
and
produced
with
hackett
as
john
ermine
at
the
globe
theatre
in
september
of
the
hottest
weather
ever
on
record
in
boston
at
that
season
of
course
seats
were
reserved
for
us
we
were
living
at
nantucket
that
year
and
we
set
sail
at
noon
to
see
the
great
production
we
snatched
a
bite
of
supper
at
a
hotel
in
boston
and
hurried
to
the
theatre
but
being
late
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
our
seats
the
curtain
was
up
and
there
sat
hackett
not
with
long
yellow
hair
which
was
the
salient
point
in
the
scout
but
rather
looking
more
like
a
parlor
indian
than
a
real
live
such
as
all
we
army
people
knew
i
thought
this
will
never
do
the
house
was
full
hackett
did
the
part
well
and
the
audience
murmured
on
going
out
a
very
artistic
success
but
the
play
was
too
mystical
too
sad
it
would
have
suited
the
new
theatre
patrons
better
i
wrote
him
from
nantucket
and
criticized
one
or
two
minor
points
such
as
the
riding
habits
of
the
women
which
were
slouchy
and
unbecoming
and
made
the
army
people
look
like
poor
emigrants
and
i
received
this
letter
in
reply
webster
avenue
new
rochelle
y
my
dear
much
obliged
for
your
talk
it
is
just
what
we
want
proper
impressions
i
fought
for
that
long
hair
but
the
management
said
the
audience
has
got
to
have
some
hackett
why
i
could
not
see
but
he
is
a
matinee
idol
and
that
long
with
the
box
office
we
dress
katherine
up
better
the
long
rehearsals
at
night
nearly
killed
me
i
was
completely
done
up
and
came
home
on
train
monday
in
that
terrific
heat
and
now
i
am
in
the
hands
of
a
doctor
imagine
me
a
week
without
sleep
hope
that
fight
took
jack
back
to
his
youth
for
the
stage
i
do
think
it
was
bad
we
get
grey
shirts
on
their
men
later
the
old
lady
arrives
she
has
been
in
gloversville
i
think
the
play
will
go
but
we
may
have
to
save
ermine
the
public
is
a
funny
old
cat
and
wo
stand
for
the
mustard
well
glad
you
had
a
good
time
and
of
course
you
ca
charge
me
up
with
the
heat
yours
frederick
remington
made
a
trip
to
the
yellowstone
park
and
this
is
what
he
wrote
to
jack
his
letters
were
never
dated
my
dear
summerhayes
say
if
you
could
get
a
few
puffs
of
this
cold
air
out
here
you
would
think
you
were
full
of
champagne
water
i
feel
like
a
d
kid
i
thought
i
should
never
be
young
again
but
here
i
am
only
years
old
my
whiskers
are
falling
out
capt
brown
of
the

says
if
you

am
painting
and
doing
some
good
work
made
a
govt

yesterday
in
the
course
of
time
he
bought
an
island
in
the
lawrence
and
they

several
summers
there
on
the
occasion
of
my
husband
accepting
a
detail
in
active
service
in
washington
at
the
soldiers

letter
ingleneuk
chippewa
bay
y
my

there
you

and
i
d
glad
you
are
so
nicely

it
the
least
they

for
you
and
you
ought
to
be
able
to
enjoy
it
for
ten
years
before
they
find
any
spavins
on
you
if
you
will
behave
yourself
but
i
guess
you
will
drift
into
that
army
and
navy
club
and
round
up
with
a
lot
of
those
old
alkalied
whom
neither
indians
nor
whiskey
could
kill
and
gout
will
take
you
over
his
route
to
arlington
i
on
the
water
wagon
and
i
feel
like
a
young
mule
i
am
never

try
the
walking
if
i
lose
my
whip

and
throw
my
eye
over
you
to
see
how
you
go
we
made
a
trip
down
to
new
foundland
but
saw
nothing
worth
while
i
guess
i
am
getting
to
be
an
old
swat
i
ca
see
anything
that
did
happen
twenty
years
ago
y
frederick
at
the
close
of
the
year
just
gone
this
great
soul
passed
from
the
earth
leaving
a
blank
in
our
lives
that
nothing
can
ever
fill
passed
into
the
great
beyond
whose
mysteries
were
always
troubling
his
mind
suddenly
and
swiftly
the
call
came
the
hand
was
stilled
and
the
restless
spirit
took
its
flight
chapter
xxxiii
david
island
at
davids
island
the
four
happiest
years
of
my
army
life
glided
swiftly
away
there
was
a
small
steam
tug
which
made
regular
and
frequent
trips
over
to
new
rochelle
and
we
enjoyed
our
intercourse
with
the
artists
and
players
who
lived
there
zogbaum
whose
well
known
pictures
of
sailors
and
warships
and
soldiers
had
reached
us
even
in
the
far
west
and
whose
charming
family
added
so
much
to
our
pleasure
julian
hawthorne
with
his
daughter
hildegarde
now
so
well
known
as
a
literary
critic
henry
loomis
nelson
whose
fair
daughter
margaret
came
to
our
little
dances
and
promptly
fell
in
love
with
a
young
slim
straight
artillery
officer
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
followed
by
a
short
courtship
and
a
beautiful
little
country
wedding
at
miss
home
on
the
old
pelham
road
where
hildegarde
hawthorne
was
bridesmaid
in
a
white
dress
and
scarlet
flowers
the
artillery
colors
and
many
famous
literary
people
from
everywhere
were
present
augustus
thomas
the
brilliant
playwright
whose
home
was
near
the
remingtons
on
lathers
hill
and
whose
wife
so
young
so
beautiful
and
so
accomplished
made
that
home
attractive
and
charming
francis
wilson
known
to
the
world
at
large
first
as
a
singer
in
comic
opera
and
now
as
an
actor
and
author
also
lived
in
new
rochelle
and
we
came
to
have
the
honor
of
being
numbered
amongst
his
friends
a
devoted
husband
and
kind
father
a
man
of
letters
and
a
book
lover
such
is
the
man
as
we
knew
him
in
his
home
and
with
his
family
and
now
came
the
delicious
warm
summer
days
we
persuaded
the
quartermaster
to
prop
up
the
little
row
of
old
bathing
houses
which
had
toppled
over
with
the
heavy
winter
gales
there
were
several
bathing
enthusiasts
amongst
us
we
had
a
pretty
fair
little
stretch
of
beach
which
was
set
apart
for
the
officers
families
and
now
what
bathing
parties
we
had
kemble
the
illustrator
joined
our
ranks
and
on
a
warm
summer
morning
the
little
old
tug
hamilton
was
gay
with
the
artists
and
their
families
the
players
and
writers
of
plays
and
soon
you
could
see
the
little
garrison
hastening
to
the
beach
and
the
swimmers
running
down
the
long
pier
down
the
and
off
head
first
into
the
clear
waters
of
the
sound
what
a
company
was
that
the
younger
and
the
older
ones
all
together
children
and
their
fathers
and
mothers
all
happy
all
well
all
so
gay
and
we
of
the
frontier
so
enamored
of
civilization
and
what
it
brought
us
there
were
no
intruders
and
ah
those
were
happy
days
uncle
sam
seemed
to
be
making
up
to
us
for
what
we
had
lost
during
all
those
long
years
in
the
wild
places
then
augustus
thomas
wrote
the
play
of
arizona
and
we
went
to
new
york
to
see
it
put
on
and
we
sat
in
thomas
box
and
saw
our
frontier
life
brought
before
us
with
startling
reality
and
so
one
season
followed
another
each
bringing
its
pleasures
and
then
came
another
lovely
wedding
for
my
brother
harry
gave
up
his
bachelor
estate
and
married
one
of
the
nicest
and
handsomest
girls
in
westchester
county
and
their
home
in
new
rochelle
was
most
attractive
my
son
was
at
the
stevens
institute
and
both
he
and
katharine
were
able
to
spend
their
vacations
at
david
island
and
altogether
our
life
there
was
near
to
perfection
we
were
doomed
to
have
one
more
tour
in
the
west
however
and
this
time
it
was
the
middle
west
for
in
the
autumn
of
jack
was
ordered
to
jefferson
barracks
missouri
on
construction
work
jefferson
barracks
is
an
old
and
historic
post
on
the
mississippi
river
some
ten
miles
south
of
louis
i
could
not
seem
to
take
any
interest
in
the
post
or
in
the
life
there
i
could
not
form
new
ties
so
quickly
after
our
life
on
the
coast
and
i
did
not
like
the
mississippi
valley
and
louis
was
too
far
from
the
post
and
the
trolley
ride
over
there
too
disagreeable
for
words
after
seven
months
of
just
existing
on
my
part
at
jefferson
barracks
jack
received
an
order
for
fort
myer
the
end
the
aim
the
dream
of
all
army
people
fort
myer
is
about
three
miles
from
washington
we
lost
no
time
in
getting
there
and
were
soon
settled
in
our
pleasant
quarters
there
was
some
building
to
be
done
but
the
duty
was
comparatively
light
and
we
entered
with
considerable
zest
into
the
social
life
of
the
capital
we
expected
to
remain
there
for
two
years
at
the
end
of
which
time
captain
summerhayes
would
be
retired
and
washington
would
be
our
permanent
home
but
alas
our
anticipation
was
never
to
be
realized
for
as
we
all
know
in
may
of
the
spanish
war
broke
out
and
my
husband
was
ordered
to
new
york
city
to
take
charge
of
the
army
transport
service
under
colonel
kimball
no
delay
was
permitted
to
him
so
i
was
left
behind
to
pack
up
the
household
goods
and
to
dispose
of
our
horses
and
carriages
as
best
i
could
the
battle
of
manila
bay
had
changed
the
current
of
our
lives
and
we
were
once
more
adrift
the
young
cavalry
officers
came
in
to
say
to
captain
jack
every
one
was
busy
packing
up
his
belongings
for
an
indefinite
period
and
preparing
for
the
field
we
all
felt
the
undercurrent
of
sadness
and
uncertainty
but
a
good
health
and
happy
return
was
drunk
all
around
and
jack
departed
at
midnight
for
his
new
station
and
new
duties
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
we
were
awakened
by
the
tramp
tramp
of
the
cavalry
marching
out
of
the
post
en
route
for
cuba
we
peered
out
of
the
windows
and
watched
the
troops
we
loved
so
well
until
every
man
and
horse
had
vanished
from
our
sight
fort
myer
was
deserted
and
our
hearts
were
sad
my
sister
harriet
who
was
visiting
us
at
that
time
returned
from
her
morning
walk
and
as
she
stepped
upon
the
porch
she
said
well
of
all
lonesome
places
i
ever
saw
this
is
the
worst
yet
i
am
going
to
pack
my
trunk
and
leave
i
came
to
visit
an
army
post
but
not
an
old
home
or
an
orphan
asylum
that
is
about
all
this
place
is
now
i
simply
can
not
stay
whereupon
she
proceeded
immediately
to
carry
out
her
resolution
and
i
was
left
behind
with
my
young
daughter
to
finish
and
close
up
our
life
at
fort
myer
to
describe
the
year
which
followed
that
strenuous
year
in
new
york
is
beyond
my
power
that
summer
gave
jack
his
promotion
to
a
major
but
the
anxiety
and
the
terrible
strain
of
official
work
broke
down
his
health
entirely
and
in
the
following
winter
the
doctors
sent
him
to
florida
to
recuperate
after
six
weeks
in
augustine
we
returned
to
new
york
the
stress
of
the
war
was
over
the
major
was
ordered
to
governor
island
as
chief
quartermaster
department
of
the
east
and
in
the
following
year
he
was
retired
by
operation
of
the
law
at
the
age
limit
i
was
glad
to
rest
from
the
incessant
changing
of
stations
the
life
had
become
irksome
to
me
in
its
perpetual
unrest
i
was
glad
to
find
a
place
to
lay
my
head
and
to
feel
that
we
were
not
under
orders
to
find
and
to
keep
a
under
which
we
could
abide
forever
in
by
an
act
of
congress
the
veterans
of
the
civil
war
who
had
served
continuously
for
thirty
years
or
more
were
given
an
extra
grade
so
now
my
hero
wears
with
complacency
the
silver
leaf
of
the
and
is
enjoying
the
quiet
life
of
a
civilian
but
that
fatal
spirit
of
unrest
from
which
i
thought
to
escape
and
which
ruled
my
life
for
so
many
years
sometimes
asserts
its
power
and
at
those
times
my
thoughts
turn
back
to
the
days
when
we
were
all
lieutenants
together
marching
across
the
deserts
and
mountains
of
arizona
back
to
my
friends
of
the
eighth
infantry
that
historic
regiment
whose
officers
and
men
fought
before
the
walls
of
chapultepec
and
mexico
back
to
my
friends
of
the
sixth
cavalry
to
the
days
at
camp
macdowell
where
we
slept
under
the
stars
and
watched
the
sun
rise
from
behind
the
four
peaks
of
the
macdowell
mountains
where
we
rode
the
big
cavalry
horses
over
the
sands
of
the
maricopa
desert
swung
in
our
hammocks
under
the
ramadas
swam
in
the

waters
of

they

abandoned

the

still
stand
wrapped
in
their
black
shadows
by
night
and
their
purple
colors
by
day
waiting
for
the
passing

and
the
coming

who
shall
dig
his

the

as
well
as
the
eighth

has
seen
many
vicissitudes
since
those
days
some
of
our
gallant
captains

lieutenants
have
won
their
stars
others
have
been
slain

dear

in

caused

death

he

obeyed
the
last
call
the
gay
young
officers
of

island

hold
dignified
commands
in
the
philippines
cuba
and
alaska
my
early
experiences
were
unusually
rough
none
of
us
seek
such
experiences
but
possibly
they
bring
with
them
a
sort
of
recompense
in
that
simple
comforts
afterwards
seem
by
contrast
to
be
the
greatest
luxuries
i
am
glad
to
have
known
the
army
the
soldiers
the
line
and
the
staff
it
is
good
to
think
of
honor
and
chivalry
obedience
to
duty
and
the
pride
of
arms
to
have
lived
amongst
men
whose
motives
were
unselfish
and
whose
aims
were
high
amongst
men
who
served
an
ideal
who
stood
ready
at
the
call
of
their
country
to
give
their
lives
for
a
government
which
is
to
them
the
best
in
the
world
sometimes
i
hear
the
still
voices
of
the
desert
they
seem
to
be
calling
me
through
the
echoes
of
the
past
i
hear
in
fancy
the
wheels
of
the
ambulance
crunching
the
small
broken
stones
of
the
malapais
or
grating
swiftly
over
the
gravel
of
the
smooth
white
roads
of
the
i
hear
the
rattle
of
the
ivory
rings
on
the
harness
of
the
team
i
see
the
soldiers
marching
on
ahead
i
see
my
white
tent
so
inviting
after
a
long
day
journey
but
how
vain
these
fancies
railroad
and
automobile
have
annihilated
distance
the
army
life
of
those
years
is
past
and
gone
and
arizona
as
we
knew
it
has
vanished
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
end
appendix
nantucket
island
june
when
a
few
years
ago
i
determined
to
write
my
recollections
of
life
in
the
army
i
was
wholly
unfamiliar
with
the
methods
of
publishers
and
the
firm
to
whom
i
applied
to
bring
out
my
book
did
not
urge
upon
me
the
advisability
of
having
it
electrotyped
firstly
because
as
they
said
afterwards
i
myself
had
such
a
very
modest
opinion
of
my
book
and
secondly
because
they
thought
a
book
of
so
decidedly
personal
a
character
would
not
reach
a
sale
of
more
than
a
few
hundred
copies
at
the
farthest
the
matter
of
electrotyping
was
not
even
discussed
between
us
the
entire
edition
of
one
thousand
copies
was
exhausted
in
about
a
year
without
having
been
carried
on
the
lists
of
any
bookseller
or
advertised
in
any
way
except
through
some
circulars
sent
by
myself
to
personal
friends
and
through
several
excellent
reviews
in
prominent
newspapers
as
the
demand
for
the
book
continued
i
have
thought
it
advisable
to
it
adding
a
good
deal
that
has
come
into
my
mind
since
its
publication
it
was
after
the
colonel
retirement
that
we
came
to
spend
the
summers
at
nantucket
and
i
began
to
enjoy
the
leisure
that
never
comes
into
the
life
of
an
army
woman
during
the
active
service
of
her
husband
we
were
no
longer
expecting
sudden
orders
and
i
was
able
to
think
quietly
over
the
events
of
the
past
my
old
letters
which
had
been
returned
to
me
really
gave
me
the
inspiration
to
write
the
book
and
as
i
read
them
over
the
people
and
the
events
therein
described
were
recalled
vividly
to
my
mind
events
which
i
had
forgotten
people
whom
i
had
forgotten
events
and
people
all
crowded
out
of
my
memory
for
many
years
by
the
pressure
of
family
cares
and
the
succession
of
changes
in
our
stations
by
anxiety
during
indian
campaigns
and
the
constant
readjustment
of
my
mind
to
new
scenes
and
new
friends
and
so
in
the
delicious
quiet
of
the
autumn
days
at
nantucket
when
the
summer
winds
had
ceased
to
blow
and
the
frogs
had
ceased
their
pipings
in
the
salt
meadows
and
the
sea
was
wondering
whether
it
should
keep
its
summer
blue
or
change
into
its
winter
grey
i
sat
down
at
my
desk
and
began
to
write
my
story
looking
out
over
the
quiet
ocean
in
those
wonderful
november
days
when
a
peaceful
calm
brooded
over
all
things
i
gathered
up
all
the
threads
of
my
various
experiences
and
wove
them
together
but
the
people
and
the
lands
i
wrote
about
did
not
really
exist
for
me
they
were
dream
people
and
dream
lands
i
wrote
of
them
as
they
had
appeared
to
me
in
those
early
years
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
did
not
once
stop
to
think
if
the
people
and
the
lands
still
existed
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
had
lived
in
the
day
that
began
with
reveille
and
ended
with
taps
now
on
this
enchanted
island
there
was
no
reveille
to
awaken
us
in
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
the
only
sound
we
could
hear
was
the
ruck
of
the
waves
on
the
far
outer
shores
and
the
sad
tolling
of
the
bell
buoy
when
the
heaving
swell
of
the
ocean
came
rolling
over
the
bar
and
so
i
wrote
and
the
story
grew
into
a
book
which
was
published
and
sent
out
to
friends
and
family
as
time
passed
on
i
began
to
receive
orders
for
the
book
from
army
officers
and
then
one
day
i
received
orders
from
people
in
arizona
and
i
awoke
to
the
fact
that
arizona
was
no
longer
the
land
of
my
memories
i
began
to
receive
booklets
telling
me
of
projected
railroads
also
pictures
of
wonderful
buildings
all
showing
progress
and
prosperity
and
then
came
letters
from
some
presidents
of
railroads
whose
lines
ran
through
arizona
and
from
bankers
and
politicians
and
business
men
of
tucson
phoenix
and
yuma
city
photographs
showing
shady
roads
and
streets
where
once
all
was
a
glare
and
a
sandy
waste
letters
from
mining
men
who
knew
every
foot
of
the
roads
we
had
marched
over
pictures
of
the
great
laguna
dam
on
the
colorado
and
of
the
quarters
of
the
government
reclamation
service
corps
at
yuma
these
letters
and
pictures
told
me
of
the
wonderful
contrast
presented
by
my
story
to
the
arizona
of
today
and
although
i
had
not
spared
that
country
in
my
desire
to
place
before
my
children
and
friends
a
vivid
picture
of
my
life
out
there
all
these
men
seemed
willing
to
forgive
me
and
even
declared
that
my
story
might
do
as
much
to
advance
their
interests
and
the
prosperity
of
arizona
as
anything
which
had
been
written
with
only
that
object
in
view
my
soul
was
calmed
by
these
assurances
and
i
ceased
to
be
distressed
by
thinking
over
the
descriptions
i
had
given
of
the
unpleasant
conditions
existing
in
that
country
in
the
seventies
in
the
meantime
the
san
francisco
chronicle
had
published
a
good
review
of
my
book
and
reproduced
the
photograph
of
captain
jack
mellon
the
noted
pilot
of
the
colorado
river
adding
that
he
was
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
picturesque
characters
who
had
ever
lived
on
the
pacific
coast
and
that
he
had
died
some
years
ago
and
so
he
was
really
dead
and
perhaps
the
others
too
were
all
gone
from
the
earth
i
thought
when
one
day
i
received
a
communication
from
an
entire
stranger
who
informed
me
that
the
writer
of
the
review
in
the
san
francisco
newspaper
had
been
mistaken
in
the
matter
of
captain
mellon
death
that
he
had
seen
him
recently
and
that
he
lived
at
san
diego
so
i
wrote
to
him
and
made
haste
to
forward
him
a
copy
of
my
book
which
reached
him
at
yuma
on
the
colorado
and
this
is
what
he
wrote
yuma
my
dear
summerhayes
your
good
book
and
letter
came
yesterday
for
which
accept
my
thanks
my
home
is
not
in
san
diego
but
in
coronado
across
the
bay
from
san
diego
that
is
the
reason
i
did
not
get
your
letter
sooner
in
one
hour
after
i
received
your
book
i
had
orders
for
nine
of
them
all
these
books
go
to
the
official
force
of
the
reclamation
service
here
who
are
damming
the
colorado
for
the
government
irrigation
project
they
are
not
damming
it
as
we
formerly
did
but
with
good
solid
masonry
the
dam
is
feet
long
and
feet
wide
and
feet
above
high
water
in
high
water
it
will
flow
over
the
top
of
the
dam
but
in
low
water
the
ditches
or
canals
will
take
all
the
water
out
of
the
river
the
approximate
cost
is
three
million
there
will
be
a
tunnel
under
the
river
at
yuma
just
below
the
bridge
to
bring
the
water
into
arizona
which
is
thickly
settled
to
the
mexican
line
i
have
done
nothing
on
the
river
since
the
of
last
august
at
which
date
they
closed
the
river
to
navigation
and
the
only
reason
i
am
now
in
yumais
trying
to
get
something
from
government
for
my
boats
made
useless
by
the
dam
i
expect
to
get
a
little
but
not
a
tenth
of
what
they
cost
me
your
book
could
not
have
a
better
title
it
is
vanished
arizona
sure
enough
vanished
the
good
and
warm
hearts
that
were
here
when
you
were
the
people
here
now
are
cold
blooded
as
a
snake
and
are
all
trying
to
get
the
best
of
the
other
fellow
there
are
but
two
alive
that
were
on
the
river
when
you
were
on
it
polhemus
and
myself
are
all
that
are
left
but
i
have
many
friends
on
this
coast
the
nurse
patrocina
died
in
los
angeles
last
summer
and
the
crying
kid
jesusita
she
had
on
the
boat
when
you
went
from
ehrenberg
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
grew
up
to
be
the
finest
looking
girl
in
these
parts
she
was
the
star
witness
in
a
murder
trial
in
los
angeles
last
winter
and
her
picture
was
in
all
of
the
papers
i
am
sending
you
a
picture
of
the
steamer
mojave
which
was
not
on
the
river
when
you
were
here
i
made
trips
with
her
up
to
the
virgin
river
which
is
miles
above
fort
mojave
or
miles
higher
than
any
other
man
has
gone
with
a
boat
she
was
feet
longer
than
the
gila
or
any
other
boat
ever
on
the
river
excuse
this
blowing
but
it
the
truth
in
i
was
on
a
trip
down
the
gulf
of
california
in
a
small
sail
boat
and
one
of
my
companions
was
john
stanton
in
angel
bay
a
man
whom
we
were
giving
a
passage
to
murdered
my
partner
and
ran
off
with
the
boat
and
left
charley
ticen
john
stanton
and
myself
on
the
beach
we
were
seventeen
days
tramping
to
a
village
with
nothing
to
eat
but
cactus
but
i
think
i
have
told
you
the
story
before
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
stanton
alive
he
belonged
to
new
bedford
his
father
had
been
master
of
a
when
we
reached
guaymas
stanton
found
a
friend
the
mate
of
a
steamer
the
mate
also
belonged
to
new
bedford
when
we
parted
stanton
told
me
he
was
going
home
and
was
going
to
stay
there
and
as
he
was
two
years
younger
than
me
he
may
still
be
in
new
bedford
and
as
you
are
on
the
ground
maybe
you
can
help
me
to
find
out
all
the
people
that
i
know
praise
your
descriptive
power
and
now
my
dear
summerhayes
i
suppose
you
will
have
a
hard
time
wading
through
my
scrawl
but
i
know
you
will
be
generous
and
remember
that
i
went
to
sea
when
a
little
over
nine
years
of
age
and
had
my
pen
been
half
as
often
in
my
hand
as
a
marlin
spike
i
would
now
be
able
to
write
a
much
clearer
hand
i
have
a
little
bungalow
on
coronado
beach
across
the
bay
from
san
diego
and
if
you
ever
come
there
you
or
your
husband
you
are
welcome
while
i
have
a
bean
you
can
have
half
i
would
like
to
see
you
and
talk
over
old
times
yuma
is
quite
a
place
now
no
more
adobes
built
it
is
brick
and
concrete
cement
sidewalks
and
flower
gardens
with
electric
light
and
a
good
water
system
my
home
is
within
five
minutes
walk
of
the
pacific
ocean
i
was
born
at
digby
nova
scotia
and
the
first
music
i
ever
heard
was
the
surf
of
the
bay
of
fundy
and
when
i
close
my
eyes
forever
i
hope
the
surf
of
the
pacific
will
be
the
last
sound
that
will
greet
my
ears
i
read
vanished
arizona
last
night
until
after
midnight
and
thought
what
we
both
had
gone
through
since
you
first
came
up
the
colorado
with
me
my
acquaintance
with
the
army
was
always
pleasant
and
like
tom
moore
i
often
say
let
fate
do
her
worst
there
are
relics
of
joy
bright
dreams
of
the
past
which
she
can
not
destroy
which
come
in
the
of
sorrow
and
care
and
bring
back
the
features
that
joy
used
to
wear
long
long
be
my
heart
with
such
memories
filled
i
suppose
the
colonel
goes
down
to
the
ship
chandler
and
gams
with
the
old
whaling
captains
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
a
wealthy
family
of
in
new
bedford
by
the
name
of
robinson
i
saw
one
of
their
ships
in
bombay
india
that
was
in
her
name
was
the
mary
robinson
and
altho
there
were
over
a
hundred
ships
on
the
bay
she
was
the
handsomest
there
well
good
friend
i
am
afraid
i
will
tire
you
out
so
i
will
belay
this
and
with
best
wishes
for
you
and
yours
i
am
yours
truly
j
mellon
fisher
is
long
since
called
to
his
long
home
i
had
fancied
when
vanished
arizona
was
published
that
it
might
possibly
appeal
to
the
sympathies
of
women
and
that
men
would
lay
it
aside
as
a
a
woman
book
but
i
have
received
more
really
sympathetic
letters
from
men
than
i
have
from
women
all
telling
me
in
different
words
that
the
human
side
of
the
story
had
appealed
to
them
and
i
suppose
this
comes
from
the
fact
that
originally
i
wrote
it
for
my
children
and
felt
perfect
freedom
to
put
my
whole
self
into
it
and
now
that
the
book
is
entirely
out
of
my
hands
i
am
glad
that
i
wrote
it
as
i
did
for
if
i
had
stopped
to
think
that
my
dream
people
might
be
real
people
and
that
the
real
people
would
read
it
i
might
never
have
had
the
courage
to
write
it
at
all
the
many
letters
i
have
received
of
which
there
have
been
several
hundred
i
am
sure
have
been
so
interesting
that
i
reproduce
a
few
more
of
them
here
fort
benjamin
harrison
indianapolis
indiana
january
my
dear
summerhayes
i
have
just
read
the
book
it
is
a
good
book
a
true
book
one
of
the
best
kind
of
books
after
taking
it
up
i
did
not
lay
it
down
till
it
was
finished
till
with
you
i
had
again
gone
over
the
malapais
deserts
of
arizona
and
recalled
my
own
meetings
with
you
at
niobrara
and
at
old
fort
marcy
or
santa

a

major
van
vliet

dear
madam
i
am
sending
you
herewith
my
check
for
two
copies
of
vanished
arizona
this
summer
our
mutual
friend
colonel
beaumont
late
s
cav
ordered
two
copies
for
me
and
i
have
given
them
both
away
to
friends
whom
i
wanted
to
have
read
your
delightful
and
charming
book
i
am
now
ordering
one
of
these
for
another
friend
and
wish
to
keep
one
in
my
record
library
as
a
memorable
story
of
the
bravery
and
courage
of
the
noble
band
of
army
men
and
women
who
helped
to
blaze
the
pathway
of
the
nation
progress
in
its
course
of
empire
westward
no
personal
record
written
which
i
have
read
tells
so
splendidly
of
what
the
good
women
of
our
army
endured
in
the
trials
that
beset
the
army
in
the
life
on
the
plains
in
the
days
succeeding
the
civil
war
and
all
this
at
a
time
when
the
nation
and
its
people
were
caring
but
little
for
you
all
and
the
struggles
you
were
making
i
will
be
pleased
indeed
if
you
will
kindly
inscribe
your
name
in
one
of
the
books
you
will
send
me
sincerely
yours

my
dear
summerhayes
were
i
to
say
that
i
enjoyed
vanished
arizona
i
should
very
inadequately
express
my
feelings
about
it
because
there
is
so
much
to
arouse
emotions
deeper
than
what
we
call
enjoyment
it
stirs
the
sympathies
and
excites
our
admiration
for
your
courage
and
your
fortitude
in
a
word
the
story
honest
and
unaffected
yet
vivid
has
in
it
that
touch
of
nature
which
makes
kin
of
us
all
how
actual
knowledge
and
experience
broadens
our
minds
your
appreciation
of
and
charity
for
the
weaknesses
of
those
living
a
lonely
life
of
deprivation
on
the
frontier
impressed
me
very
much
i
wish
too
that
what
you
say
about
the
canteen
could
be
published
in
every
newspaper
in
america
very
sincerely
yours

dear
sir
captain
william
baird
cavalry
retired
now
at
annapolis
sent
me
summerhay
book
to
read
and
i
have
read
it
with
delight
for
i
was
in
k
when
summerhays
took
on
in
the
myself
and
my
brother
michael
served
in
k
company
from
david
island
to
camp
apache
doubtless
you
have
forgotten
me
but
i
am
sure
that
you
remember
the
tall
fifer
of
k
michael
gurnett
he
was
killed
at
camp
mohave
in
while
in
company
g
of
the
infantry
i
was
five
years
in
k
but
my
brother
in
k
and
afterward
joined
the
first
he
served
in
the
and
oh
that
little
book
we
all
in
it
even
poor
charley
bowen
summerhays
should
have
written
a
longer
story
she
soldiered
long
enough
with
the
in
the
bloody
to
be
able
to
write
a
book
five
times
as
big
for
what
she
done
god
bless
her
she
is
entitled
to
the
irishman
benediction
may
every
hair
in
her
head
be
a
candle
to
light
her
soul
to
glory
we
poor
old
regulars
have
little
said
about
us
in
print
and
wish
to
god
that
vanished
arizona
was
in
the
hands
of
every
old
veteran
of
the
marching
if
i
had
the
means
i
would
send
a
copy
to
our
bernard
moran
and
the
other
old
comrades
at
the
soldiers
home
but
alas
evil
times
have
fallen
upon
us
and
i
not
writing
a
jeremiad
i
took
the
book
from
the
post
office
and
when
i
saw
the
crossed
guns
and
the
there
was
a
lump
in
my
throat
and
i
went
into
the
barber
shop
and
read
it
through
before
i
left
a
friend
of
mine
was
in
the
shop
and
when
i
came
to
pringle
death
he
said
gurnett
that
must
be
a
sad
book
you
reading
why
man
you
crying
i
believe
i
was
but
they
were
tears
of
joy
and
oh
lord
to
think
of
bowen
having
a
full
page
in
history
but
after
all
maybe
he
deserved
it
and
that
picture
of
my
company
commander
worth
long
long
have
i
gazed
on
it
i
was
only
sixteen
and
a
half
years
old
when
i
joined
his
company
at
david
island
folliot
whitney
was
lieutenant
and
cyrus
earnest
what
a
fine
man
whitney
was
a
finer
man
nor
truer
gentleman
ever
wore
a
shoulder
strap
if
he
had
been
company
commander
i
have
and
stayed
with
him
i
was
always
afraid
of
worth
though
he
was
always
good
to
my
brother
and
myself
i
deeply
regretted
lieut
whitney
death
in
cuba
and
i
watched
major
worth
career
in
the
last
war
it
nearly
broke
my
heart
that
i
could
not
go
oh
the
rattle
of
the
war
drum
and
the
bugle
calls
and
the
marching
troops
it
set
me
crazy
and
me
not
able
to
take
a
hand
in
the
scrap

calls
him
