i
vicky
van
victoria
van
allen
was
the
name
she
signed
to
her
letters
and
to
her
cheques
but
vicky
van
as
her
friends
called
her
was
signed
all
over
her
captivating
personality
from
the
top
of
her
dainty
tossing
head
to
the
tips
of
her
dainty
dancing
feet
i
liked
her
from
the
first
and
if
her
small
and
earlies
were
said
to
be
so
called
because
they
were
timed
by
the
small
and
early
numerals
on
the
clock
dial
and
if
her
little
bridge
games
kept
in
active
circulation
a
goodly
share
of
our
country
legal
tender
those
things
are
not
crimes
i
lived
in
one
of
the
polite
sections
of
new
york
city
up
among
the
east
sixties
and
at
the
insistence
of
my
sister
and
aunt
who
lived
with
me
our
home
was
near
enough
the
great
boulevard
to
be
designated
by
that
enviable
phrase
just
off
fifth
avenue
we
were
on
the
north
side
of
the
street
and
nearer
to
the
avenue
on
the
south
side
was
the
home
of
vicky
van
before
i
knew
the
girl
i
saw
her
a
few
times
at
long
intervals
on
the
steps
of
her
house
or
entering
her
little
car
and
i
noted
her
charm
and
her
evident
zest
of
life
later
when
a
club
friend
offered
to
take
me
there
to
call
i
accepted
gladly
and
as
i
have
said
i
liked
her
from
the
first
and
yet
i
never
said
much
about
her
to
my
sister
i
am
in
a
way
responsible
for
winnie
and
too
she
too
young
to
go
where
they
play
bridge
for
money
little
faddly
prize
bags
or
novelties
are
her
stakes
also
aunt
lucy
who
helps
me
look
after
win
would
quite
understand
the
atmosphere
at
vicky
not
exactly
bohemian
and
yet
i
suppose
it
did
represent
one
compartment
of
that
of
a
term
but
i
going
to
tell
you
right
now
about
a
party
i
went
to
there
and
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
vicky
van
was
like
how
late
you
going
out
said
winnie
as
i
slithered
into
my
topcoat
it
after
eleven
little
girls
must
make
comments
on
big
brothers
i
smiled
back
at
her
win
was
nineteen
and
i
had
attained
the
mature
age
of
we
were
orphans
and
spinster
aunt
lucy
did
her
best
to
be
a
parent
to
us
and
we
got
on
smoothly
enough
for
none
of
us
had
the
temperament
that
rouses
friction
in
the
home
across
the
street
aunt
lucy
guessed
raising
her
aristocratic
eyebrows
a
hair
breadth
yes
i
returned
the
least
bit
irritated
at
the
implication
of
that
hairbreadth
raise
steele
will
be
over
there
and
i
want
to
see
him
this
time
the
said
eyebrows
went
up
frankly
in
amusement
and
the
kind
blue
eyes
beamed
as
she
said
all
right
chet
run
along
though
i
was
chester
calhoun
the
junior
partner
of
the
law
firm
of
bradbury
and
calhoun
and
held
myself
in
due
and
consequent
respect
i
did
mind
aunt
lucy
calling
me
chet
or
even
as
she
sometimes
did
chetty
a
man
puts
up
with
those
things
from
the
women
of
his
household
as
to
winnie
she
called
me
anything
that
came
handy
from
lord
chesterton
to
i
patted
aunt
lucy
on
her
soft
old
shoulder
and
winnie
on
her
hard
young
head
and
was
off
true
i
did
expect
to
see
steele
at
vicky
van
he
was
the
club
chap
who
had
introduced
me
there
but
as
aunt
lucy
had
so
cleverly
suspected
he
was
not
my
sole
reason
for
going
a
bigger
reason
was
that
i
always
had
a
good
time
there
the
sort
of
a
good
time
i
liked
i
crossed
the
street
diagonally
in
defiance
of
much
good
advice
i
have
heard
and
read
against
such
a
proceeding
but
at
eleven
at
night
the
traffic
in
those
upper
side
streets
is
not
sufficient
to
endanger
life
or
limb
and
i
reached
vicky
van
house
in
safety
it
was
a
very
small
house
and
it
was
the
one
nearest
to
the
fifth
avenue
corner
though
the
long
side
of
the
first
house
on
that
block
of
the
avenue
lay
between
the
windows
on
each
floor
were
brilliantly
lighted
and
i
mounted
the
long
flight
of
stone
steps
sure
of
a
merry
welcome
and
a
jolly
time
i
was
admitted
by
a
maid
whom
i
already
knew
well
enough
to
say
evening
julie
as
i
passed
her
and
in
another
moment
i
was
in
the
long
narrow
and
was
a
part
of
the
gay
group
there
angel
child
exclaimed
vicky
van
herself
dancing
toward
me
did
he
come
to
see
his
little
ole
friend
and
laying
her
two
hands
in
mine
for
an
instant
she
considered
me
sufficiently
welcomed
and
danced
off
again
she
was
a
will
o
the
wisp
always
tantalizing
a
man
with
a
hope
of
special
attention
and
then
flying
away
to
another
guest
only
to
treat
him
in
the
same
way
i
looked
after
her
a
slim
graceful
thing
vibrant
with
the
joy
of
living
smiling
in
sheer
gayety
of
heart
and
pretty
as
a
picture
her
black
hair
was
arranged
in
the
newest
style
that
covered
her
ears
with
soft
loops
and
exposed
the
shape
of
her
trim
little
head
it
was
banded
with
a
jeweled
fillet
or
whatever
they
call
those
oriental
things
they
wear
and
her
big
eyes
with
their
long
dark
lashes
her
pink
cheeks
and
curved
scarlet
lips
seemed
to
say
the
world
owes
me
a
living
and
i
going
to
collect
not
as
a
matter
of
financial
obligation
be
it
understood
vicky
van
had
money
enough
and
though
nothing
about
her
home
was
ostentatious
or
over
ornate
it
was
quietly
and
in
the
best
of
taste
luxurious
but
i
was
describing
vicky
herself
her
gown
the
skirt
part
of
it
was
a
sort
of
mazy
thin
stuff
rather
short
and
rather
full
that
swirled
as
she
moved
and
fluttered
when
she
danced
the
bodice
part
was
of
heavily
material
and
a
kind
of
overskirt
arrangement
was
a
lot
of
long
gold
fringe
made
of
beads
instead
of
a
yoke
there
were
shoulder
straps
of
these
same
beads
and
the
sleeves
were
there
and
yet
that
costume
was
all
right
why
it
was
a
rig
i
be
glad
to
see
winnie
in
when
she
gets
older
and
if
i
made
it
sound
rather
er
gay
and
festive
it
my
bungling
way
of
describing
it
and
also
because
vicky
personality
would
add
gayety
and
festivity
to
any
raiment
her
little
feet
wore
goldy
slippers
and
a
lot
of
ribbons
over
her
ankles
and
on
the
top
of
each
slipper
was
a
gilt
butterfly
that
fluttered
yet
with
all
this
bewildering
effect
of
frivolity
the
first
term
make
use
of
in
describing
vick
character
would
be
i
believe
there
a
flower
called
that
me
or
some
such
name
well
that
vicky
van
she
laugh
and
jest
with
you
and
then
if
you
said
anything
by
way
of
a
personal
compliment
or
flirtatious
foolery
she
was
off
and
away
from
your
side
like
a
in
a
summer
breeze
she
was
a
witch
a
madcap
but
she
had
her
own
way
in
everything
and
her
friends
did
her
will
without
question
her
setting
too
just
suited
her
her
living
room
was
one
of
those
very
narrow
very
deep
rooms
so
often
seen
in
the
new
york
side
streets
it
was
done
up
in
french
gray
and
rose
as
was
the
dictum
of
the
moment
on
the
walls
were
few
pictures
but
just
the
right
ones
gray
enameled
furniture
and
deep
with
cushions
provided
and
soft
lights
gave
a
mild
glow
of
illumination
flowers
were
everywhere
great
bowls
of
roses
jars
of
pink
carnations
and
occasionally
a
vase
of
pink
orchids
were
on
mantel
low
bookcases
or
piano
and
sometimes
the
odor
of
a
cigarette
or
a
burning
pastille
of
oriental
fragrance
added
to
the
bohemian
effect
which
is
oftener
than
not
discernible
by
the
sense
of
smell
vicky
herself
detested
perfumes
or
odors
of
any
kind
save
fresh
flowers
all
about
indeed
she
detested
bohemianism
when
it
meant
unconventional
dress
or
manners
or
jests
or
songs
her
house
was
dainty
correct
and
artistic
and
yet
i
knew
its
atmosphere
would
not
please
my
aunt
lucy
or
be
just
the
right
place
for
winnie
many
of
the
guests
i
knew
cassie
weldon
was
a
concert
singer
and
ariadne
gale
an
artist
of
some
prominence
both
socially
and
in
her
art
circle
jim
ferris
and
bailey
mason
were
actors
of
a
good
sort
and
bert
garrison
a
member
of
one
of
my
best
clubs
was
a
fast
rising
architect
steele
had
come
yet
two
tables
of
bridge
were
playing
in
the
back
part
of
the
room
and
in
the
rest
of
the
rather
limited
space
several
couples
were
dancing
may
we
open
the
doors
to
the
dining
room
vicky
called
out
one
of
the
card
players
the
calorics
of
this
room
must
be
about
ninety
in
the
shade
open
them
a
little
way
returned
miss
van
allen
but
not
wide
for
there
a
surprise
supper
and
i
do
want
you
to
see
it
yet
they
set
the
double
doors
a
few
inches
ajar
and
went
on
with
their
game
the
dining
room
as
i
knew
was
a
wide
room
that
ran
all
across
the
house
behind
both
and
hall
it
was
beautifully
decorated
in
pale
green
and
silver
and
often
vicky
van
would
have
a
surprise
supper
at
which
the
favors
or
entertainers
would
be
well
worth
waiting
for
having
greeted
many
whom
i
knew
i
looked
about
for
further
speech
with
my
hostess
she
upstairs
in
the
music
room
said
cassie
weldon
seeing
and
interpreting
my
questing
glance
thank
you
lady
for
those
kind
words
i
called
back
over
my
shoulder
and
went
upstairs
the
front
room
on
the
second
floor
was
dubbed
the
music
room
vicky
said
because
there
was
a
banjo
in
it
sometimes
the
guests
brought
more
banjos
and
a
concert
of
glees
and
college
songs
would
ensue
but
more
often
as
it
was
a
little
haven
of
rest
and
peace
from
the
laughter
and
jest
below
stairs
it
was
an
exquisite
white
and
gold
room
and
here
too
as
i
entered
pale
pink
shades
dimmed
the
lights
to
a
soft
radiance
that
seemed
like
a
breaking
dawn
vicky
sat
enthroned
on
a
white
divan
her
feet
crossed
on
a
white
satin
in
front
of
her
sat
three
or
four
of
her
guests
all
laughing
and
chatting
but
he
vowed
he
was
going
to
get
here
somehow
reeves
was
saying
what
his
name
asked
vicky
though
in
a
voice
of
little
interest
somers
returned
reeves
never
heard
of
him
did
you
mr
calhoun
and
vicky
van
looked
up
at
me
as
i
entered
no
miss
van
allen
who
is
he
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
only
as
reeves
says
he
is
coming
here
tonight
i
like
to
know
something
about
him
coming
here
a
man
you
do
know
i
drew
up
a
chair
to
join
the
group
how
can
he
steele
is
going
to
bring
him
said
reeves
he
says
norman
steele
says
that
somers
is
a
chap
and
no
end
of
fun
says
he
a
millionaire
what
a
millionaire
more
or
less
to
me
laughed
vicky
i
choose
my
friends
for
their
lovely
character
not
for
their
wealth
yes
you
selected
all
of
us
for
that
dear
agreed
reeves
but
this
somers
gentleman
may
be
amiable
too
reeves
was
a
solid
sensible
sort
of
person
who
acted
as
ballast
for
the
volatile
vicky
and
sometimes
reprimanded
her
in
a
mild
way
i
love
the
child
she
had
said
to
me
once
and
she
is
a
little
brick
but
once
in
a
while
i
have
to
tell
her
a
few
things
for
the
good
of
the
community
she
takes
it
all
like
an
angel
well
i
do
care
vicky
went
on
norman
steele
has
no
right
to
bring
anybody
here
whom
he
has
asked
me
about
if
i
do
like
him
i
shall
ask
some
of
you
nice
amiable
men
to
get
me
a
long
plank
and
we
put
it
out
of
a
window
and
make
him
walk
it
shall
we
we
all
agreed
to
do
this
or
to
tar
and
feather
and
ride
on
a
rail
any
gentleman
who
might
in
any
way
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
fall
one
iota
short
of
vicky
van
requirements
and
now
said
vicky
if
you
all
please
go
downstairs
except
reeves
and
garrison
and
my
own
sweet
self
i
be
orfly
obliged
to
you
the
sweeping
gesture
with
which
she
sought
to
dismiss
us
was
a
wave
of
her
white
arms
and
a
smile
of
her
red
lips
and
i
for
one
found
it
impossible
to
obey
i
started
with
the
rest
and
then
after
the
gay
crowd
were
part
way
down
stairs
i
turned
back
please
may
i
join
your
little
class
if
i
be
very
good
i
begged
i
do
want
bert
garrison
to
be
left
alone
at
the
mercy
of
two
such
sirens
miss
van
allen
hesitated
her
forefinger
rested
a
moment
on
her
curved
lip
yes
she
said
nodding
her
head
yes
stay
calhoun
you
may
be
a
help
are
you
any
good
at
getting
theatre
boxes
after
they
all
sold
that
my
profession
i
returned
i
learned
it
from
a
correspondence
school
where
the
theatre
lead
me
to
it
it
the
metropolis
theatre
she
replied
and
i
want
to
have
a
party
there
night
and
i
want
two
boxes
and
this
awful
dreadful
bad
garrison
says
they
all
sold
and
i
ca
get
any
what
can
you
do
about
it
oh
i
fix
it
i
go
to
the
people
who
bought
the
boxes
you
want
and
i
do
know
what
i
say
to
them
exactly
but
i
fix
up
such
a
yarn
that
they
beg
me
to
take
the
boxes
off
their
hands
oh
will
you
really
and
the
dazzling
smile
she
gave
me
would
have
repaid
a
much
greater
herculean
task
than
i
had
undertaken
and
of
course
i
had
meant
it
but
when
she
thought
i
did
i
could
go
back
on
my
word
i
do
my
best
miss
van
allen
i
said
seriously
and
if
i
possibly
turn
the
trick
i
well
i
buy
the
metropolitan
opera
house
and
put
on
a
show
of
my
own
no
she
laughed
you
need
do
that
but
if
you
try
and
fail
why
we
just
have
a
little
party
here
a
sort
of
consolation
party
and
oh
let
have
some
private
theatricals
would
that
be
fun
more
fun
than
the
original
program
i
asked
quickly
hoping
to
be
let
off
my
promise
no
sir
she
cried
decidedly
not
i
want
especially
to
have
that
theatre
party
and
supper
afterward
at
the
britz
now
you
do
all
you
can
wo
you
i
promised
to
do
all
i
could
and
i
had
a
partial
hope
i
could
get
what
she
wanted
by
hook
or
crook
and
then
as
she
heard
a
specially
favorite
being
dashed
off
on
the
piano
downstairs
she
sprang
from
her
seat
and
kicking
the
satin
cushion
aside
asked
me
to
dance
in
a
moment
we
were
whirling
around
the
music
room
to
the
zipping
music
and
reeve
and
garrison
followed
in
our
steps
vicky
danced
with
a
natural
born
talent
that
is
quite
unlike
anything
acquired
by
lessons
i
had
no
need
to
guide
her
she
divined
my
lead
and
swayed
in
any
direction
even
as
i
was
about
to
indicate
it
i
had
never
danced
with
anyone
who
danced
so
well
and
i
was
profuse
in
my
thanks
and
praise
i
love
it
she
said
simply
as
she
patted
the
gold
fringes
of
her
gown
into
place
i
adore
dancing
and
you
are
one
of
the
best
partners
i
have

and

into
a
bridge
game
we
just
about
have
time
before
supper
pirouetting
before
me
she
led
the
way
and
we
went
down
the
long
steep
stairs
a
shout
greeted
her
appearance
in
the
doorway
oh
vicky
we
have
missed

over
here
and
listen
to
latest
old
joke

to

very
newest
flirts

him
a
tryout
vicky
van
settled
herself
into
her
seat
with
the
happy
little
sigh
of
the
bridge
lover
who
sits
down
with
three
good
players
and
in
another
moment
she
was
breathlessly
looking
over
her
hand
without
she
said
triumphantly
and
knowing
she
say
no
word
more
to
me
for
the
present
i
walked
away
with
cassie
weldon
and
cassie
was
good
fun
she
took
me
to
the
piano
and
with
the
soft
pedal
down
she
showed
me
a
new
little
tone
picture
she
had
made
up
which
was
both
picturesque
and
funny
you
better
go
into
vaudeville
i
exclaimed
as
she
finished
your
talent
is
wasted
on
the
concert
platform
that
what
vicky
tells
me
she
returned
sometimes
i
believe
i
will
try
it
just
for
fun
you
find
it
such
fun
you
stay
in
for
earnest
i
assured
her
for
she
had
shown
a
bit
of
inventive
genius
that
i
felt
sure
would
make
good
in
a
little
musical
turn
chapter
ii
somers
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
steele
came
and
with
him
was
a
man
i
had
never
seen
before
and
whom
i
assumed
to
be
the
somers
i
had
heard
about
and
it
was
as
steele
entered
he
cast
his
eye
around
for
vicky
and
saw
her
at
the
bridge
table
down
at
the
end
of
the
room
her
back
was
toward
us
and
she
was
so
absorbed
in
the
game
she
did
not
look
round
if
indeed
she
heard
the
noise
of
their
arrival
the
two
men
stopped
near
the
group
i
was
with
and
steele
introduced
somers
a
little
curiously
i
looked
at
him
and
saw
a
large
looking
man
wearing
an
expansive
smile
and
expensive
apparel
clothes
the
very
best
procurable
jewelry
just
inside
the
limits
of
good
taste
he
bore
himself
like
a
gentleman
yet
there
was
an
unmistakable
air
of
ostentatious
wealth
that
repelled
me
a
second
look
made
me
think
somers
had
dined
either
late
or
twice
but
his
greetings
were
courteous
and
genial
and
his
manner
sociable
if
a
little
patronizing
he
seemed
a
stranger
to
all
present
and
his
eye
roved
about
for
the
charming
hostess
steele
had
told
him
of
we
reach
miss
van
allen
presently
steele
laughed
in
answer
to
the
glance
if
indeed
we
dare
interrupt
her
game
let
make
progress
slowly
no
hurry
returned
somers
affably
beaming
on
cassie
weldon
and
meeting
ariadne
gale
receptive
smile
i
anchored
here
for
the
moment
miss
weldon
ah
yes
i
heard
you
sing
voice
like
a
lark
like
a
lark
clearly
somers
was
not
much
of
a
purveyor
of
small
talk
i
sized
him
up
for
a
lumbering
oldster
who
wanted
to
be
playful
but
did
quite
know
how
he
had
rather
an
austere
face
yet
there
was
a
gleam
in
his
eye
that
belied
the
austerity
his
cheeks
were
fat
and
red
his
nose
prominent
and
he
was
clean
shaven
save
for
a
thick
white
mustache
that
drooped
slightly
on
either
side
of
a
mouth
his
hair
was
white
his
eyes
dark
and
and
he
could
easily
be
called
a
handsome
man
he
was
surely
fifty
and
perhaps
more
had
it
not
been
for
a
certain
effusiveness
in
his
speech
i
could
have
liked
him
but
he
seemed
to
me
to
lack
sincerity
however
i
am
not
one
to
judge
harshly
or
hastily
and
i
met
him
half
way
and
even
helped
him
in
his
efforts
at
gay
affability
you
never
been
here
before
i
asked
good
old
steele
to
bring
you
no
never
before
and
he
glanced
around
appreciatively
but
i
shall
i
hope
come
often
charming
little
nest
charming
ladies
a
bow
included
those
nearest
yes
indeed
babbled
ariadne
fair
women
and
brave
men
brave
yes
agreed
somers
to
dare
the
glances
of
such
bright
eyes
i
must
protect
my
heart
he
clasped
his
fat
hands
pretty
near
where
his
heart
was
situated
and
grinned
with
delight
as
ariadne
also
protected
her
heart
ah
he
cried
two
hearts
in
danger
i
feel
sure
we
shall
be
friends
if
only
because
misery
loves
company
is
it
really
misery
with
you
and
ariadne
sympathy
was
so
evidently
profound
that
cassie
weldon
and
i
walked
away
i
give
ariad
her
innings
said
the
vivacious
miss
weldon
and
i
make
up
to
the
somers
kid
later
where
vicky
pick
him
up
she
does
know
him
at
all
norman
steele
brought
him
unbeknownst
no
why
vick
does
allow
that
sort
of
thing
so
i
told
any
way
steele
did
it
well
vicky
such
a
darling
maybe
she
wo
mind
for
once
she
wo
if
she
likes
the
little
stranger
he
at
any
rate
so
ariadne
from
her
smile
i
think
she
well
means
to
sell
him
her
latest
in
the
adirondacks
or
with
a
handbag
now
do
be
mean
but
cassie
laughed
and
i
do
blame
her
if
she
does
poor
ad
paints
above
the
heads
of
the
public
so
if
this
is
a
publican
she
better
make
sales
while
the
sun
shines
what
her
work
like
you
can
see
more
of
it
in
this
house
than
anywhere
else
vicky
is
so
fond
of
ariadne
and
so
sorry
her
pictures
do
sell
better
that
she
buys
a
lot
herself
does
miss
gale
know
miss
van
allen
does
it
out
of
do
say
charity
no
they
really
good
stuff
and
vicky
buys
for
christmas
gifts
and
bridge
prizes
does
she
ever
play
for
prizes
i
thought
she
liked
a
bit
of
a
stake
now
yes
at
evening
parties
but
often
we
have
a
dove
game
of
an
afternoon
with
prizes
and
pink
tea
vicky
van
is
a
gay
doll
you
know
she
sometimes
she
positively
domestic
i
wish
she
had
a
nice
husband
and
some
little
kiddies
why
has
she
give
it
up
she
never
seen
any
man
she
loved
i
perhaps
she
love
this
somers
person
heaven
forbid
nothing
less
than
a
crown
prince
would
suit
vicky
van
look
she
turning
to
meet
him
wo
he
be
bowled
over
i
turned
and
though
there
were
several
people
between
us
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
somers
face
as
he
was
presented
to
miss
van
allen
he
was
bowled
over
his
eyes
beamed
with
admiration
and
he
bowed
low
as
he
raised
to
his
lips
the
dainty
bejeweled
hand
vicky
apparently
did
not
welcome
this
greeting
and
she
drew
away
her
hand
saying
not
allowed
naughty
man
express
proper
compunction
or
you
ca
sit
next
me
at
supper
forgive
me
begged
somers
i
sorry
i
never
do
it
again
until
after
i
sit
next
you
at
supper
more
brains
than
i
thought
i
said
to
cassie
who
nodded
and
then
vicky
van
rose
from
her
chair
take
my
place
for
a
moment
somers
she
said
standing
before
him
i
she
dropped
her
eyes
adorably
i
must
see
about
the
arrangement
of
seats
at
the
supper
table
with
a
merry
laugh
she
ran
from
the
room
and
through
the
long
hall
to
the
somers
dropped
into
her
vacant
chair
and
continued
the
bridge
game
with
the
air
of
one
who
knows
how
to
play
in
less
than
five
minutes
vicky
was
back
no
keep
the
hand
she
said
as
he
rose
i
played
long
enough
and
supper
will
be
ready
shortly
finish
the
rubber
i
insist
somers
returned
and
as
he
determinedly
stood
behind
the
chair
vicky
perforce
sat
down
he
continued
to
stand
behind
her
chair
watching
her
play
vicky
was
too
sure
of
her
game
to
be
rattled
at
his
close
scrutiny
but
it
seemed
to
me
her
shoulders
shrugged
a
little
impatiently
as
he
criticized
or
commended
her
plays
she
had
thrown
a
light
scarf
of
gauze
or
tulle
around
when
she
was
out
of
the
room
and
being
the
same
color
as
her
gown
it
made
her
seem
more
than
ever
like
an
houri
she
smiled
up
into
somers
face
and
then
coyly
her
long
lashes
fell
on
her
pink
cheeks
evidently
she
had
concluded
to
bewitch
the
newcomer
and
she
was
making
good
i
drew
nearer
principally
because
i
liked
to
look
at
her
she
was
a
live
wire
she
looked
roguish
and
she
made
most
brilliant
plays
tossing
down
her
cards
with
gay
little
gestures
and
doing
trick
shuffles
with
her
twinkling
fingers
you
could
have
had
that
last
trick
if
you
played
for
it
somers
said
as
the
rubber
finished
i
know
it
vicky
conceded
i
saw
just
too
late
that
i
was
getting
the
lead
into
the
wrong
hand
well
do
ever
do
that
again
he
said
lightly
never
again
as
he
said
the
last
word
he
laid
his
finger
tips
on
her
shoulder
it
was
the
veriest
touch
the
shoulder
was
swathed
in
the
transparent
tulle
but
still
it
roused
vicky
she
glanced
up
at
him
and
i
looked
at
him
too
but
somers
was
not
in
flirtatious
mood
he
said
i
beg
your
pardon
in
most
correct
fashion
had
he
then
touched
her
inadvertently
it
did
seem
so
but
his
speech
assured
it
vicky
jumped
up
from
the
table
and
ignoring
somers
ran
out
to
the
hall
saying
something
about
looking
after
the
surprise
for
the
supper
to
my
surprise
somers
followed
her
not
hastily
but
rather
deliberately
and
quelling
an
absurd
impulse
to
go
too
i
turned
to
norman
steele
who
stood
near
who
this
somers
i
asked
him
rather
abruptly
is
he
all
right
you
bet
said
steele
smiling
he
a
in
what
respects
every
and
all
you
known
him
long
yes
i
tell
you
cal
he
all
right
forget
it
what
the
surprise
for
supper
do
you
know
of
course
not
it
would
be
a
surprise
if
we
all
knew
of
it
well
vicky
surprises
are
always
great
fun
why
the
grouch
old
man
ca
you
chirrup
oh
i
all
right
and
i
felt
annoyed
that
he
read
in
my
face
that
i
was
put
out
but
i
did
like
the
looks
of
somers
and
i
could
say
so
to
the
man
who
had
brought
him
there
oh
please
oh
shouted
a
hoarse
strange
voice
and
one
scarcely
to
be
heard
above
the
hum
of
gay
voices
and
peals
of
gay
laughter
oh
please
i
looked
across
the
room
and
in
the
wide
hall
doorway
stood
a
man
who
was
quite
evidently
a
waiter
he
was
and
and
he
fairly
hung
on
to
a
portiere
for
support
as
he
repeated
his
agonized
plea
what
is
it
said
reeves
as
everybody
else
stared
at
the
man
what
do
you
want
she
stepped
toward
him
and
we
all
turned
to
look
not
you
no
madame
some
man
please
some
doctor
is
there
one
here
some
of
the
servants
ill
asked
reeves
kindly
doctor
remson
will
you
come
the
woman
paused
only
until
doctor
remson
joined
her
and
the
two
went
into
the
hall
the
waiter
following
slowly
in
a
moment
i
heard
a
shriek
a
wild
scream
partly
curiosity
and
partly
a
foreboding
of
harm
to
vicky
van
made
me
rush
forward
reeves
had
screamed
and
i
ran
the
length
of
the
hall
to
the
dining
room
there
i
saw
somers
on
the
floor
and
remson
bending
over
him
he
killed
he
stabbed
cried
reeves
clutching
at
my
arm
as
i
reached
her
oh
what
shall
we
do
she
stood
just
in
the
doorway
which
was
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
as
in
most
city
houses
the
room
was
but
dimly
lighted
the
table
candles
not
yet
burning
keep
the
people
back
i
shouted
as
those
in
the
pressed
out
into
the
hall
steele
keep
those
girls
back
there
was
an
awful
commotion
the
men
urged
the
women
back
but
curiosity
and
horror
made
them
surge
forward
in
irresistible
force
shut
the
door
whispered
remson
this
man
is
dead
it
an
awful
situation
shut
that
door
somehow
i
managed
to
get
the
door
closed
between
the
and
hall
on
the
inside
were
remson
reeves
who
would
budge
and
myself
outside
in
the
hall
was
a
crowd
of
hysterical
women
and
frightened
men
are
you
sure
i
asked
in
a
low
voice
going
nearer
to
the
doctor
and
looking
at
somers
eyes
sure
he
was
stabbed
straight
to
the
heart
with
see
a
small
sharp
knife
her
hands
over
her
eyes
but
peering
through
her
fingers
reeves
drew
near
not
really
she
moaned
oh
not
really
dead
ca
we
do
anything
for
him
no
said
remson
rising
to
his
feet
from
his
kneeling
position
he
dead
i
tell
you
who
did
it
that
waiter
i
began
and
then
stopped
looking
in
from
a
door
opposite
the
hall
door
probably
one
that
led
to
a
butler
pantry
or
kitchen
were
half
a
dozen
waiters
come
in
here
said
remson
not
all
of
you
which
is
chief
i
am
sir
and
a
head
waiter
came
into
the
room
what
has
happened

man

been
killed
said
the
doctor
shortly
who
are

the
chief
we
caterer
men
from
fraschini
luigi
we

the
italian

truthful
though
scared

you
been
in
and
out
of
the
all
evening
yes

the
table

such
but

miss
van

broke
in
i
i

luigi
hesitated
and
doctor
remson
interrupted
we

questions
calhoun

must
call
the
police
the
police
cried
reeves
oh
no
no

said
the
doctor
firmly
and
no
one
must
enter
or

this
room
until
an
officer
arrives

there
in
that
pantry

declared
the
lady

an
officer
of
the
law
i
stay
in
the
house
but
not
in
this
room
she
stalked
out
into
the
hall
and
doctor
remson
went
at
once
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
headquarters
the
guests
in
the
living
room
hearing
this
flew
into
a
panic
of
course
it
was
no
longer
possible
nor
as
i
could
see
desirable
to
keep
them
in
ignorance
of
what
had
happened
after
calling
the
police
doctor
remson
returned
to
his
post
just
inside
the
door
he
answered
questions
patiently
at
first
but
after
being
nearly
driven
crazy
by
the
frantic
women
he
said
sharply
you
may
all
do
just
as
you
like
i
no
authority
here
except
that
the
ethics
of
my
profession
dictate
that
does
not
extend
to
jurisdiction
over
the
guests
present
but
i
advise
you
as
a
matter
of
common
decency
to
stay
here
until
this
affair
is
investigated
but
they
did
many
of
them
hastily
gathered
up
their
wraps
and
went
out
of
the
house
as
quickly
as
possible
cassie
weldon
came
to
me
in
her
distress
i
must
go
calhoun
she
said
do
you
think
i
may
why
it
would
interfere
greatly
with
my
work
to
have
it
known
that
i
was
mixed
up
in
a
you
not
mixed
up
in
it
miss
weldon
i
began
to
speak
a
little
sternly
but
the
look
in
her
eyes
aroused
my
sympathy
well
go
on
i
said
i
suppose
you
will
testify
if
called
on
everybody
knows
where
to
find
you
yes
she
said
slowly
but
i
hope
i
wo
be
called
on
why
it
might
spoil
my
whole
career
she
slipped
out
of
the
door
in
the
wake
of
some
other
departing
guests
after
all
i
thought
it
could
matter
much
few
if
any
of
them
were
implicated
and
they
could
all
be
found
at
their
homes
and
yet
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
we
ought
all
to
stay
i
shall
remain
and
face
the
music
i
heard
reeves
saying
where
vicky
do
you
suppose
she
knows
about
this
i
going
up
in
the
music
room
to
see
if
she
there
you
know
with
all
the
excitement
down
here
those
upstairs
may
know
nothing
of
it
i
shall
remain
too
said
ariadne
gale
why
should
anyone
kill
somers
did
the
caterer
people
do
it
what
an
awful
thing
will
it
be
in
the
papers
it
said
garrison
who
was
standing
near
reporters
may
be
here
any
minute
must
be
here
as
soon
as
the
police
come
where
is
miss
van
allen
i
do
know
and
ariadne
began
to
cry
stop
that
said
reeves
gruffly
but
not
unkindly
stay
if
you
want
to
ariadne
but
behave
like
a
sensible
woman
not
a
silly
schoolgirl
this
is
an
awful
tragedy
of
some
sort
what
do
you
mean
of
some
sort
asked
miss
gale
i
mean
we
do
know
what
revelations
are
yet
to
come
where
norman
steele
where
the
man
who
brought
this
somers
here
sure
enough
where
was
steele
i
had
forgotten
all
about
him
and
it
was
he
who
had
introduced
somers
to
the
van
allen
house
and
no
one
else
present
so
far
as
i
knew
was
previously
acquainted
with
the
man
now
lying
dead
the
other
side
of
that
closed
door
i
looked
over
the
people
who
had
stayed
only
a
handful
perhaps
half
a
dozen
and
then
i
wondered
if
i
better
go
home
myself
not
for
my
own
sake
in
any
way
indeed
i
preferred
to
remain
but
i
thought
of
aunt
lucy
and
win
ought
i
to
bring
on
them
any
shadow
of
trouble
or
opprobrium
that
might
result
from
my
presence
in
that
house
at
that
time
would
it
not
be
better
to
go
while
i
could
do
so
for
once
the
police
took
charge
i
knew
i
should
be
called
on
to
testify
in
public
and
even
as
i
debated
with
myself
the
police
arrived
chapter
iii
the
waiter
story
doctor
remson
police
call
had
been
imperative
and
inspector
mason
came
in
with
two
men
what
this
what
wrong
here
the
big
burly
inspector
said
as
he
faced
the
few
of
us
who
had
remained
come
in
here
inspector
said
the
doctor
from
the
door
and
from
that
moment
the
whole
aspect
of
the
house
seemed
to
change
no
longer
a
gay
little
bijou
residence
it
became
a
court
of
justice
one
of
the
men
was
stationed
at
the
street
door
and
one
at
the
area
door
below
headquarters
was
notified
of
details
the
coroner
was
summoned
and
we
were
all
for
the
moment
under
detention
where
is
miss
van
allen
where
is
the
lady
of
the
house
asked
mason
where
are
the
servants
who
is
in
charge
here
was
ever
a
string
of
questions
so
impossible
of
answers
doctor
remson
told
the
main
facts
but
he
was
reticent
i
too
hesitated
to
say
much
for
the
case
was
strange
indeed
reeves
looked
gravely
concerned
but
said
nothing
ariadne
gale
began
to
babble
that
girl
did
know
how
to
be
quiet
i
guess
miss
van
allen
is
upstairs
she
volunteered
she
was
in
the
but
she
is
here
now
so
she
must
be
upstairs
shall
i
go
and
see
no
thundered
the
inspector
stay
where
you
are
search
the
house
breen
i
cover
the
street
door
the
man
he
called
breen
went
upstairs
on
the
jump
and
mason
continued
tell
the
story
one
of
you
who
is
this
man
who
killed
him
as
he
talked
the
inspector
was
examining
somers
body
making
rapid
notes
in
a
little
book
keeping
his
eye
on
the
door
and
darting
quick
glances
at
each
of
us
as
he
tried
to
grasp
the
situation
i
looked
at
bert
garrison
who
was
perhaps
the
most
favored
of
miss
van
allen
friends
but
he
shook
his
head
so
i
threw
myself
into
the
breach
inspector
i
said
that
man
name
is
somers
further
than
that
i
know
nothing
he
is
a
stranger
to
all
of
us
and
he
came
to
this
house
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
how
he
happen
to
come
friend
of
miss
van
allen
he
met
her
for
the
first
time
he
came
here
with
i
paused
it
was
so
hard
to
know
what
to
do
steele
had
gone
home
ought
i
to
implicate
him
go
on
came
here
with
whom
the
truth
now
i
usually
speak
the
truth
i
returned
shortly
he
came
with
norman
steele
where
is
mr
steele
he
has
gone
there
were
a
great
many
people
here
and
naturally
some
of
them
went
away
when
this
tragedy
was
discovered
humph
then
of
course
the
guilty
party
escaped
but
we
are
getting
nowhere
does
nobody
know
anything
of
this
man
but
his
name
nobody
did
but
ariadne
piped
up
he
was
a
delightful
man
he
told
me
he
was
a
great
patron
of
art
and
often
bought
pictures
paying
little
heed
to
her
the
inspector
was
endeavoring
to
learn
from
the
dead
man
property
something
more
about
him
no
letters
or
papers
he
said
disappointedly
as
he
turned
out
the
pockets
not
unusual
in
evening
togs
but
not
even
a
card
or
anything
personal
looks
queer
look
in
his
watch
said
ariadne
bridling
with
importance
giving
her
a
keen
glance
the
inspector
followed
her
suggestion
in
the
back
of
the
case
was
a
picture
of
a
coquettish
face
undoubtedly
that
of
an
actress
it
was
not
carefully
fastened
in
but
roughly
cut
out
and
pressed
in
with
ragged
edges
temporary
grunted
the
inspector
and
recently
stuck
in
some
chicken
he
took
out
to
supper
he
a
club
man
you
say
yes
steele
said
so
and
also
vouched
for
his
worth
and
character
i
resented
the
inspector
attitude
though
i
knew
nothing
of
somers
and
did
altogether
like
him
yet
i
saw
no
reason
to
think
ill
of
the
dead
until
circumstances
warranted
it
further
search
brought
a
thick
roll
of
money
some
loose
silver
a
with
seven
or
eight
keys
eyeglasses
in
a
silver
case
handkerchiefs
a
gold
pencil
a
knife
and
such
trifles
as
any
man
might
have
in
his
pockets
but
no
directly
identifying
piece
of
property
was
embroidered
in
tiny
white
letters
on
the
handkerchiefs
and
a
monogram
was
on
his
seal
ring
his
jewelry
which
was
costly
the
inspector
did
not
touch
there
were
magnificent
pearl
studs
a
watch
fob
set
with
a
black
opal
and
pearl
cufflinks
examination
of
his
hat
showed
the
pierced
letters
but
nothing
gave
clue
to
his
christian
name
somers
said
the
inspector
musingly
what
club
does
he
belong
to
i
do
know
i
replied
steele
belongs
to
several
but
somers
does
not
belong
to
any
that
i
do
at
least
i
never
seen
him
at
any
call
in
the
servants
let
find
out
something
about
this
household
as
no
one
else
moved
to
do
it
i
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
pantry
and
summoned
the
head
waiter
of
the
caterer
where
are
the
house
servants
i
asked
him
there
are
any
sir
he
replied
looking
shudderingly
at
the
grisly
form
on
the
floor
no
servants
in
a
house
of
this
type
what
do
you
mean
that
true
said
reeves
breaking
her
silence
at
last
miss
van
allen
has
a
very
capable
woman
who
is
housekeeper
and
maid
in
one
but
when
guests
are
here
the
suppers
are
served
from
the
caterer
then
call
the
housekeeper
and
where
is
miss
van
allen
herself
she
not
in
the
house
said
the
policeman
breen
returning
from
his
search
not
in
the
house
cried
reeves
where
is
she
i
been
all
over
every
room
every
floor
she
is
in
the
house
there
nobody
upstairs
at
all
no
housekeeper
or
maid
demanded
mason
then
they
got
away
here
waiter
tell
me
all
you
know
of
this
thing
the
italian
luigi
came
forward
shaking
with
terror
and
wringing
his
fingers
nervously
i
d
do
know
anything
about
it
he
began
but
mason
interrupted
you
do
you
know
all
about
it
did
you
kill
this
man
no
dio
mio
no
a
thousand
no
then
unless
you
wish
to
be
suspected
of
it
tell
all
you
know
a
commotion
at
the
door
heralded
the
coroner
arrival
also
a
detective
and
a
couple
of
plain
clothes
men
clearly
here
was
a
mysterious
case
the
coroner
at
once
took
matters
in
his
own
hands
inspector
mason
told
him
all
that
had
been
learned
so
far
and
though
coroner
fenn
seemed
to
think
matters
had
been
pretty
well
bungled
he
made
no
comment
and
proceeded
with
the
inquiries
sure
there
nobody
upstairs
he
asked
breen
positive
i
looked
in
every
nook
and
cranny
i
raked
the
whole
house
but
the
basement
and
kitchen
part
go
down
there
then
and
then
go
back
and
search
upstairs
again
somebody
may
be
hiding
who
here
knows
miss
van
allen
the
most
intimately
perhaps
i
do
said
reeves
or
miss
gale
we
are
both
her
warm
friends
i
also
her
friend
volunteered
bert
garrison
and
i
can
guarantee
that
if
miss
van
allen
has
fled
from
this
house
it
was
out
of
sheer
fright
she
never
saw
this
man
until
he
was
a
stranger
to
us
all
where
the
housekeeper
went
on
fenn
i
think
she
must
be
somewhere
about
said
reeves
perhaps
in
the
kitchen
julie
is
an
all
round
capable
woman
when
there
are
no
guests
she
prepares
miss
van
allen
meals
herself
when
company
is
present
the
caterer
always
is
employed
and
there
are
no
other
servants
not
permanent
ones
replied
reeves
i
believe
the
laundress
and
chore
boy
come
by
the
day
also
cleaning
women
and
such
but
i
know
that
miss
van
allen
has
no
resident
servant
besides
the
maid
julie
this
woman
must
be
found
snapped
the
coroner
but
we
must
first
of
all
identify
the
body
mason
call
up
the
principal
clubs
on
the
telephone
and
locate
somers
also
find
norman
steele
now
luigi
let
have
your
story
the
trembling
waiter
stammered
incoherently
and
said
little
of
moment
look
here
said
fenn
bluntly
is
that
your
knife
sticking
in
him
i
mean
is
it
one
belonging
to
fraschini
service
do
touch
it
but
look
at
it
you
can
tell
luigi
leaned
over
the
dead
man
yes
it
is
one
of
our
boning
knives
he
said
we
always
bring
our
own
hardware
well
then
if
you
want
to
clear
yourself
and
your
men
of
doubt
tell
all
you
know
i
know
this
and
luigi
braced
himself
to
the
ordeal
i
was
waiting
in
the
pantry
for
miss
van
allen
to
send
me
word
to
serve
supper
and
i
peeped
in
the
now
and
then
to
see
if
it
was
time
i
heard
presently
miss
van
allen
voice
also
a
man
voice
i
want
to
intrude
so
waited
for
a
summons
after
a
moment
or
two
i
heard
a
little
scream
and
heard
somebody
or
something
fall
i
had
no
thought
of
anything
wrong
but
thought
the
guests
were
unusually
er
riotous
are
miss
van
allen
guests
inclined
to
be
riotous
no
sir
oh
no
asseverated
the
man
while
reeves
and
ariadne
looked
indignant
and
for
that
reason
i
felt
a
little
curious
so
i
pushed
the
door
ajar
and
peeped
in
what
did
you
see
i
saw
luigi
paused
so
long
that
i
feared
he
was
going
to
collapse
but
the
coroner
eyed
him
sternly
and
he
went
on
i
saw
miss
van
allen
standing
looking
down
at
this
this
gentleman
on
the
floor
and
making
as
if
to
pull
out
the
knife
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
and
i
watched
her
she
did
pull
the
knife
but
she
straightened
up
looked
around
glanced
down
at
her
gown
which
which
was
stained
with
blood
and
then
she
ran
out
into
the
hall
where
did
she
go
i
do
know
i
could
see
as
the
door
was
but
on
a
crack
then
i
thought
i
ought
to
go
into
the
and
i
did
i
looked
at
the
gentleman
and
i
did
know
what
to
do
so
i
went
into
the
hall
to
the
parlor
door
and
called
for
help
for
a
doctor
or
somebody
and
then
they
all
came
out
here
that
all
i
know
luigi
nerve
gave
way
and
he
sank
into
a
chair
with
a
sob
fenn
looked
at
him
and
considerately
left
him
alone
for
the
time
can
this
be
true
he
said
turning
to
us
can
you
suspect
miss
van
allen
of
this
crime
no
cried
bert
garrison
and
the
women
at
once
and
no
said
i
i
am
positive
miss
van
allen
did
not
know
somers
and
could
not
have
killed
an
utter
stranger
on
no
provocation
whatever
you
do
not
know
what
provocation
she
may
have
had
suggested
fenn
now
look
here
coroner
said
reeves
very
decidedly
i
wo
have
miss
van
allen
spoken
of
in
any
such
way
i
assume
you
mean
that
this
man
though
a
stranger
might
have
said
or
done
something
to
annoy
or
offend
miss
van
allen
well
if
he
had
done
so
victoria
van
allen
never
would
have
killed
him
she
is
the
gentlest
most
gay
and
girl
and
though
she
never
tolerates
any
rudeness
or
familiarity
the
idea
of
her
killing
a
man
is
too
absurd
you
might
as
well
suspect
a
dove
or
a
butterfly
of
crime
that
right
coroner
said
garrison
that
waiter
story
is
an
hallucination
of
some
sort
if
it
is
a
deliberate
falsification
miss
van
allen
is
a
dainty
happy
creature
and
to
connect
her
with
anything
like
this
absurd
that
to
be
found
out
garrison
why
did
miss
van
allen
run
away
i
do
admit
that
she
did
run
away
in
the
sense
of
flight
if
she
were
frightened
at
this
thing
if
she
saw
it
she
may
have
run
out
of
the
door
in
hysterics
or
in
a
panic
of
terror
but
she
the
perpetrator
never
never
echoed
reeves
the
poor
child
if
she
did
come
out
here
and
saw
this
awful
sight
why
i
think
it
would
unhinge
her
mind
who
is
miss
van
allen
asked
fenn
what
is
her
occupation
she
has
an
occupation
said
reeves
she
is
a
young
lady
of
independent
fortune
as
to
her
people
or
immediate
relatives
i
know
nothing
at
all
i
known
her
a
year
or
so
and
as
she
never
referred
to
such
matters
i
never
inquired
but
she
a
thorough
little
gentlewoman
and
i
defend
her
against
any
slander
to
my
utmost
powers
and
so
will
i
said
miss
gale
i
sure
of
her
fineness
of
character
and
lovely
nature
but
these
opinions
ladies
do
help
our
inquiries
interrupted
fenn
what
can
you
men
tell
us
what
i
want
first
is
to
identify
this
body
or
rather
to
learn

an
inquest
until
these
points
are
cleared

the
inspector
returning
from
his
long
telephone
quest
i
called
up
four
clubs
norman
steele

of
them
but
this
man
does
seem
to
belong
to
any

there
are
somerses
and
even
somerses
but
they
all
have
middle
names
and
too
their
description
does
fit
this
somers
then
steele
misrepresented
him
did
you
get
steele
mason

he
was
at
any
of
the
clubs
i
found
his
residence
a
bachelor
apartment

but
he
is
there
either
find
steele
find
miss
van
allen
find
the
maid

her
name
julia
julie
she
was
always
called
said
reeves
if
miss
van
allen
went
away
i
no
doubt
julie
went
with
her
she
is
a
most
devoted
caretaker
of
her
mistress
an
oldish
woman
no
perhaps
between
and
forty
what
she
look
like
describe
her
ariadne
you
an
artist
julie
said
miss
gale
is
a
good
sort
she
she
has
brown
hair
and
rather
hazel
eyes
she
wears
glasses
and
she
stoops
a
little
in
her
walk
she
has
perfect
training
and
correct
manners
and
she
is
a
model
servant
but
she
gives
the
impression
of
watching
over
miss
van
allen
whatever
else
she
may
be
engaged
in
at
the
same
time
wears
black
no
usually
gray
gowns
or
sometimes
white
inconspicuous
aprons
and
no
cap
she
not
quite
a
menial
but
yet
not
entirely
a
housekeeper
english
english
speaking
if
that
what
you
mean
but
i
think
she
an
american
do
you
mrs
reeves
american
yes
of
course
chapter
iv
somers
real
name
detective
lowney
who
had
come
with
the
coroner
had
said
little
but
had
listened
to
all
occasionally
he
would
dart
from
the
room
and
return
a
few
moments
later
scribbling
in
his
notebook
he
was
an
alert
little
man
with
beady
black
eyes
and
a
stubby
black
mustache
i
want
a
few
words
with
that
caterer
man
he
said
suddenly
and
then
they
better
clear
away
this
supper
business
and
go
home
we
all
turned
to
look
at
the
table
it
stood
in
the
end
of
the
that
was
back
of
the
the
sideboard
was
at
the
opposite
end
back
of
the
hall
and
it
was
directly
in
front
of
the
sideboard
that
somers
body
lay
lowney
turned
on
more
light
and
a
thrill
went
through
us
at
the
incongruity
of
that
gay
table
and
the
tragedy
so
near
it
as
always
at
vicky
van
parties
the
appointments
were
dainty
and
elaborate
flowers
decorated
the
table
lace
silver
and
glass
were
of
finest
quality
and
in
the
centre
was
the
contrivance
known
as
a
jack
horner
pie
that
was
to
be
the
surprise
said
reeves
i
knew
about
it
the
pie
is
full
of
lovely
trinkets
and
little
jokes
on
the
guests
i
thought
those
things
were
for
children
parties
observed
fenn
looking
with
interest
at
the
gorgeous
confection
they
really
for
birthdays
said
reeves
and
is
vicky
birthday
that
was
part
of
her
surprise
she
did
want
it
known
lest
the
guests
should
bring
gifts
she
like
a
child
vicky
is
just
as
happy
over
a
birthday
party
as
a
little
girl
would
be
what
does
miss
van
allen
look
like
asked
the
detective
she
pretty
replied
reeves
awfully
pretty
but
not
a
raving
beauty
black
hair
and
bright
fresh
coloring
how
was
she
dressed
giddy
clothes
in
an
evening
gown
returned
reeves
who
resented
the
detective
manner
a
beautiful
french
gown
of
tulle
and
gold
trimmings
and
all
that
jewels
yes
i
said
as
reeves
disdained
to
answer
full
evening
costume
and
a
necklace
and
earrings
of
amber
set
in
gold
well
what
i
getting
at
is
said
lowney
a
woman
dressed
like
that
could
go
very
far
in
the
streets
without
being
noticed
surely
be
able
to
trace
miss
van
allen
where
would
she
be
likely
to
go
i
do
know
said
reeves
she
would
go
to
my
home
i
live
down
in
washington
square
nor
to
mine
chirped
ariadne
it
over
on
the
west
side
i
do
believe
she
left
the
house
declared
the
coroner
tell
us
again
luigi
asked
lowney
just
where
did
the
lady
seem
to
go
when
you
saw
her
leave
this
room
i
ca
say
sir
i
was
looking
through
a
small
opening
as
i
pushed
the
door
ajar
and
i
was
so
amazed
at
what
i
saw
that
i
was
sort
of
paralyzed
and
did
dare
open
the
door
further
go
back
to
the
pantry
commanded
fenn
and
look
in
just
as
you
did
the
waiter
retreated
to
the
post
he
had
held
and
setting
the
door
a
few
inches
ajar
proved
that
he
could
see
body
by
the
sideboard
but
could
not
command
a
view
of
the
hall
now
i
represent
miss
van
allen
and
lowney
stood
over
the
body
of
somers
is
this
the
place
a
little
farther
to
the
right
sir
and
luigi
earnestness
and
good
faith
were
unmistakable
yes
sir
just
there
now
i
walk
out
into
the
hall
is
this
the
way
she
went
yes
sir
the
same
lowney
went
from
the
to
the
hall
and
it
was
clear
that
his
further
progress
could
not
be
seen
by
the
peeping
waiter
you
see
fenn
the
detective
went
on
from
here
in
the
back
of
this
long
hall
miss
van
allen
could
have
left
the
house
by
two
ways
she
could
have
gone
out
at
the
front
door
passing
the
parlor
or
she
could
have
gone
down
these
basement
stairs
which
are
just
under
the
stairs
to
the
second
story
then
she
could
have
gone
out
by
the
front
area
door
which
would
give
her
access
to
the
street
she
could
have
caught
up
a
cloak
as
she
went
or
said
fenn
musingly
she
could
have
run
upstairs
the
staircase
is
so
far
back
in
the
hall
that
the
guests
in
the
parlor
would
not
have
seen
her
this
is
a
very
deep
house
you
see
it
was
true
the
stairs
began
so
far
back
in
the
long
hall
that
vicky
could
easily
have
slipped
upstairs
after
leaving
the
without
being
seen
by
any
of
us
in
the
unless
we
were
in
its
doorway
looking
out
was
anybody
so
many
guests
had
left
that
this
point
could
not
be
revealed
i
did
see
her
declared
reeves
and
i
do
believe
she
was
in
the
at
all
i
do
care
what
that
waiter
says
oh
yes
madame
reiterated
luigi
it
was
miss
van
allen
i
know
her
well
often
she
comes
to
fraschini
and
always
i
take
her
orders
she
came
even
this
afternoon
to
make
sure
the
great
cake
the
jack
horner
was
all
right
and
she
approved
it
ah
she
clapped
her
hands
at
sight
of
it
we
all
do
our
best
for
miss
van
allen
she
is
a
lovely
lady
miss
van
allen
is
one
of
your
regular
customers
one
of
our
best
very
often
we
serve
her
and
always
she
orders
our
finest
wares
you
provide
everything
everything
candles
flowers
decorations
all
and
she
pays
her
bills
most
promptly
by
cheque
yes
sir
and
there
are
no
servants
here
but
the
maid
julie
i
have
often
seen
others
but
i
fancy
they
do
not
live
in
the
house
madame
julie
superintends
and
directs
us
always
miss
van
allen
leaves
much
to
her
she
is
most
capable
when
did
you
see
this
woman
this
julie
last
a
short
time
before
before
that
happened
luigi
looked
toward
the
body
she
was
in
and
out
of
the
pantries
all
the
evening
she
admitted
the
guests
she
acted
as
ladies
maid
and
she
arranged
the
favors
in
the
pie
it
was
i
should
say
ten
minutes
or
so
since
she
was
last
in
the
pantry
when
i
peeped
in
at
the
door
where
was
julie
then
i
do
know
i
did
not
see
her
perhaps
upstairs
or
maybe
in
the
front
of
the
hall
waiting
to
bring
me
word
to
serve
supper
tell
me
something
distinctive
about
this
maid
appearance
was
she
yes
a
woman
but
nothing
especial
about
her
she
had
many
gold
fillings
in
her
teeth
that
something
and
lowney
noted
it
with
satisfaction
go
on
but
luigi
seemed
to
know
nothing
else
that
differentiated
julie
from
her
sisters
in
service
and
lowney
changed
his
questions
how
could
miss
van
allen
get
that
knife
of
yours
he
asked
i
do
know
sir
it
was
i
suppose
in
the
pantry
with
our
other
knives
what
is
its
use
it
is
a
boning
knife
but
doubtless
one
of
our
men
used
it
in
cutting
celery
for
salad
or
some
such
purpose
ask
them
inquiry
showed
that
a
man
named
palma
had
used
the
knife
for
making
a
salad
and
had
left
it
in
the
butler
pantry
an
hour
or
so
before
the
crime
was
committed
any
one
could
have
taken
the
knife
without
its
being
missed
as
the
salad
had
been
completed
and
put
aside
in
that
case
miss
van
allen
must
have
secured
the
knife
some
little
time
before
it
was
used
as
luigi
was
in
the
pantry
just
previously
observed
fenn
that
shows
premeditation
it
was
done
with
a
weapon
picked
up
at
the
moment
then
it
could
have
been
done
by
miss
van
allen
exclaimed
reeves
triumphantly
for
vicky
had
no
reason
to
premeditate
killing
a
man
she
had
never
seen
before
vicky
did
do
it
wailed
ariadne
i
know
she
did
she
must
be
found
said
lowney
but
she
will
be
found
if
innocent
she
will
return
herself
if
guilty
we
must
find
her
and
we
will
a
householder
can
not
drop
out
of
existence
unnoticed
by
any
one
does
she
own
this
house
i
think
so
said
reeves
i
not
positive
but
it
my
impression
that
she
does
vicky
van
never
boasts
or
talks
of
her
money
or
of
herself
but
i
know
she
gives
a
good
deal
in
charity
and
is
always
ready
to
subscribe
to
philanthropic
causes
i
tell
you
she
is
not
the
criminal
and
i
do
believe
she
ever
left
this
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
evening
dress
that
child
is
scared
to
death
and
is
hiding
in
the
attic
or
somewhere
suppose
reeves
said
the
coroner
you
go
with
lowney
and
look
over
the
house
again
search
the
bedrooms
and
i
will
and
reeves
seemed
to
welcome
an
opportunity
to
help
she
was
a
woman
and
a
staunch
friend
of
vicky
van
i
was
glad
she
was
on
hand
to
stand
up
for
the
girl
for
i
confess
things
looked
to
me
pretty
dubious
come
along
too
calhoun
said
reeves
there
no
telling
what
we
may
find
perhaps
there
further
tragedy
i
knew
what
was
in
her
mind
that
if
vicky
had
done
the
thing
she
might
have
in
an
agony
of
remorse
taken
her
own
life
thrilled
with
this
new
fear
i
followed
lowney
and
reeves
we
went
downstairs
first
we
examined
all
the
basement
rooms
and
the
small
city
back
yard
there
was
no
sign
of
vicky
van
or
of
julie
and
next
we
came
back
to
the
first
floor
hunted
that
and
then
on
upstairs
the
music
room
was
soon
searched
and
i
fell
back
as
the
others
went
into
vicky
bedroom
come
on
calhoun
said
lowney
we
must
make
a
thorough
job
of
it
this
time
the
bedroom
was
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
fairy
dream
furniture
of
white
enameled
wicker
with
pink
satin
cushions
everywhere
the
most
exquisite
appointments
of
silver
crystal
and
embroidered
fabrics
and
a
bed
fit
for
a
princess
it
seemed
profanation
for
the
little
detective
to
poke
and
pry
around
in
wardrobes
and
cupboards
though
i
knew
it
must
be
done
he
was
not
only
looking
for
vicky
but
noting
anything
that
might
bear
on
her
disappearance
but
there
was
no
clue
everything
was
in
order
and
all
just
as
a
refined
woman
would
have
her
belongings
the
bedroom
was
over
the
and
back
of
this
over
the
pantry
extension
was
vicky
van
this
was
a
bijou
boudoir
and
chiffonier
and
were
all
in
keeping
with
the
personality
of
their
owner
the
walls
were
panelled
in
pale
rose
color
and
a
few
fine
pictures
were
in
absolute
harmony
a
long
mirror
was
in
a
florentine
gilt
frame
and
a
by
a
reading
table
bespoke
hours
of
ease
ruthlessly
lowney
pried
into
everything
ran
his
arm
among
the
gowns
hanging
in
the
wardrobe
and
looked
into
the
carved
chests
again
no
clue
the
perfect
order
everywhere
showed
perhaps
preparation
for
guests
but
nothing
indicated
flight
or
hiding
the
boxes
held
some
bits
of
jewelry
but
nothing
of
really
great
value
an
escritoire
was
full
of
letters
and
papers
and
this
lowney
locked
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
if
it
all
right
he
said
there
no
harm
done
and
if
the
lady
does
show
up
we
must
examine
the
stuff
on
we
went
to
the
third
floor
of
the
house
the
rooms
here
were
unused
save
one
that
was
evidently
julie
the
furnishings
though
simple
were
attractive
and
showed
a
thoughtful
mistress
and
an
appreciative
maid
everything
was
in
order
several
uniforms
of
black
and
of
gray
were
in
the
cupboard
and
several
white
aprons
and
one
white
dress
there
were
books
and
a
and
such
things
as
betokened
the
life
of
a
sedate
busy
woman
we
left
no
room
no
cupboard
unopened
no
hall
or
loft
unsearched
we
looked
in
under
and
behind
every
piece
of
furniture
and
came
at
last
to
the
unescapable
conclusion
that
wherever
vicky
van
might
be
she
was
not
in
her
own
house
downstairs
we
went
and
found
coroner
fenn
and
inspector
mason
in
the
hall
they
had
let
doctor
remson
go
home
also
garrison
and
miss
gale
the
waiters
too
had
been
sent
off
you
people
can
go
if
you
like
fenn
said
to
reeves
and
myself
i
take
your
addresses
and
you
can
expect
to
be
called
on
as
witnesses
if
we
ever
get
anything
to
witness
i
never
saw
such
a
case
no
criminal
to
arrest
and
nobody
knows
the
victim
he
must
be
from
out
of
town
we
nail
steele
and
begin
to
get
somewhere
also
we
look
up
miss
van
allen
credits
and
business
acquaintances
a
woman
ca
have
lived
two
years
in
a
house
like
this
and
not
have
somebody
know
her
antecedents
and
relatives
i
suppose
steele
brought
his
friend
here
and
then
when
this
thing
happened
he
was
scared
and
lit
out
maybe
steele
did
the
killing
suggested
lowney
no
disagreed
fenn
i
believe
that
dago
waiter
yarn
i
him
a
lot
before
i
let
him
go
and
i
sure
telling
what
he
saw
i
see
fraschini
head
man
or
i
suppose
it
now
hello
who
that
another
policeman
came
in
at
the
street
door
what
up
he
said
looking
about
in
amazement

what
doing

was

officer

the
beat
where

a
kitchen
knife

the
coroner
and
ferrall
went
toward
the
dining
room
and
on
an
irresistible
impulse
of
curiosity

ferrall
as
he
caught

of

but
look
here
are
you
sure
this
is
randolph
schuyler
sure
of
course
i
sure
his
house
is
on
my
beat
i
see
him
often
goin
in
or
comin
out
well
then
we
got
a
big
case
on
our
hands
mason
the
inspector
could
scarcely
believe
ferrall
statement
but
realized
that
the
policeman
must
know
whew
he
said
trying
to
think
of
a
dozen
things
at
once
then
steele
knew
him
and
introduced
him
as
somers
on
purpose
no
wonder
the
clubs
did
know
of
somers
on
his
handkerchiefs
and
all
that
he
used
a
false
name
he
did
want
it
known
that
randolph
schuyler
came
to
see
miss
van
allen
oh
here
a
mess
where
that
girl
why
did
she
kill
him
she
did
reeves
began
to
cry
she
did
know
it
schuyler
she
does
schuyler
i
sure
she
does
because
we
were
making
lists
for
bazar
patrons
and
she
said
she
would
ask
only
people
she
knew
and
we
tried
to
find
somebody
who
knew
randolph
schuyler
to
ask
him
but
we
did
know
anybody
who
was
acquainted
with
him
at
all
oh
it
ca
be
the
rich
schuyler
why
would
he
come
here
we
must
get
hold
of
steele
as
soon
as
possible
said
fenn
excitedly
breen
call
up
his
home
address
again
and
if
he
there
go
there
and
stick
till
he
comes
now
for
some
one
to
identify
this
body
call
up
the
schuyler
house
no
better
go
around
there
where
is
it
ferrall
go
straight
out
to
the
avenue
and
turn
down
it
only
part
of
a
block
down
who
going
you
go
lowney
said
fenn
mason
will
you
go
yes
of
course
come
on
lowney
the
coroner
gave
reeves
and
myself
permission
to
go
home
and
i
was
glad
to
go
but
reeves
declared
her
intention
of
staying
the
night
what
was
left
of
it
in
miss
van
allen
house
it
too
late
for
me
to
go
down
alone
she
said
in
her
sensible
way
and
too
i
rather
be
here
in
case
in
case
miss
van
allen
comes
home
i
her
friend
and
i
know
she
like
me
to
stay
chapter
v
the
schuyler
household
as
for
me
i
began
to
collect
my
senses
after
the
shock
of
learning
the
true
identity
of
the
dead
man
though
i
had
never
met
him
randolph
schuyler
was
a
client
and
friend
of
my
partner
charles
bradbury
and
i
suddenly
felt
a
sort
of
personal
responsibility
of
action
for
one
thing
i
disliked
the
idea
of
schuyler
wife
and
family
receiving
the
first
tidings
of
the
tragedy
from
the
police
it
seemed
to
me
a
friend
ought
to
break
the
news
if
possible
i
said
as
much
to
coroner
fenn
and
he
agreed
that
so
he
said
it
be
an
awful
errand
in
the
middle
of
the
night
too
if
you
acquainted
suppose
you
go
there
with
the
boys
mr
calhoun
i
not
personally
acquainted
but
schuyler
is
my
client
though
there
been
little
business
of
his
with
our
firm
of
late
but
as
a
matter
of
humanity
i
go
if
you
say
so
and
be
of
any
help
i
can
go
by
all
means
probably
they
be
glad
of
your
advice
and
assistance
in
many
ways
i
dreaded
the
errand
yet
i
thought
if
the
police
had
had
to
go
and
tell
winnie
and
aunt
lucy
any
such
awful
news
how
glad
they
be
to
have
somebody
present
of
their
own
world
even
of
their
own
neighborhood
so
i
went
as
we
had
been
told
the
schuyler
house
was
only
a
few
doors
below
the
avenue
corner
even
as
mason
rang
the
bell
i
was
thinking
how
strange
that
a
man
should
go
to
a
house
where
he
desired
to
conceal
his
own
name
when
it
was
so
near
his
own
dwelling
and
yet
i
knew
too
that
the
houses
on
fifth
avenue
are
as
far
removed
from
houses
just
off
the
avenue
as
if
they
were
in
a
different
town
mason
ring
was
answered
by
a
man
of
imperturbable
countenance
what
wanted
he
said
gazing
calmly
at
the
policemen
where
is
mr
schuyler
asked
the
inspector
in
a
way
he
out
said
the
man
respectfully
enough
but
of
no
mind
to
be
loquacious
where
i
do
know
he
went
to
his
club
after
dinner
and
has
not
yet
returned
are
you
his
valet
yes
i
wait
up
for
him
he
comes
in
with
his
key
i
no
idea
when
he
will
return
is
his
wife
at
home
yes
schuyler
is
at
home
clearly
this
man
was
answering
questions
only
because
he
recognized
the
authority
that
asked
them
but
he
volunteered
no
information
who
else
is
in
the
family
children
no
schuyler
has
no
children
his
two
sisters
are
here
and
schuyler
that
is
all
they
are
all
in
bed
yes
sir
has
anything
happened
to
mr
schuyler
yes
there
has
schuyler
is
dead
dead
the
imperturbable
calm
gave
way
and
the
valet
became
nervously
excited
what
do
you
mean
where
is
he
shall
i
go
to
him
we
will
come
in
said
lowney
for
until
now
we
had
stood
outside
then
we
will
tell
you
are
any
of
the
other
servants
about
no
sir
they
are
all
in
bed
then
what
is
your
name
cooper
sir
then
cooper
call
the
butler
or
whoever
is
in
general
charge
and
summon
mrs
schuyler
i
call
jepson
he
the
butler
sir
and
i
call
maid
tibbetts
if
she
in
and
the
maid
hester
who
waits
on
the
misses
schuyler
shall
i
yes
get
things
started
get
jepson
as
soon
as
you
can
this
is
an
awful
affair
said
mason
as
cooper
went
off
we
were
in
the
hall
a
great
apartment
more
like
a
room
save
that
a
broad
staircase
curved
up
at
one
side
the
furnishings
were
magnificent
but
in
a
taste
heavily
ornate
and
a
little
there
were
carved
and
upholstered
benches
but
none
of
us
cared
to
sit
the
tension
was
too
great
keep
your
eyes
open
lowney
he
went
on
there
lots
to
be
picked
up
from
servants
before
they
really
on
their
guard
get
all
you
can
about
schuyler
evening
habits
from
the
man
cooper
but
go
easy
with
the
ladies
it
hard
enough
for
them
at
best
the
valet
reappeared
with
jepson
this
butler
was
of
the
accepted
type
portly
and
important
but
the
staggering
news
cooper
had
evidently
told
him
had
made
him
a
man
among
men
what
this
he
said
gravely
the
master
dead
apoplexy
no
jepson
schuyler
was
killed
by
some
one
we
do
know
who
did
it
killed
murdered
my
god
the
butler
spoke
in
a
strong
low
voice
with
no
hint
of
dramatic
effect
how
will
schuyler
bear
it
how
shall
we
tell
her
jepson
mason
showed
a
consultant
air
for
the
butler
was
so
evidently
a
man
of
judgment
and
sense
we
must
waken
her
maid
and
let
her
rouse
schuyler
then
the
other
ladies
schuyler
sisters
we
must
them
yes
jepson
do
all
those
things
as
quickly
as
you
can
but
the
wait
seemed
interminable
at
last
the
butler
came
back
and
asked
us
up
to
the
library
the
front
room
on
the
floor
above
here
a
footman
was
lighting
a
fire
on
the
hearth
for
the
house
had
the
chill
of
the
small
hours
first
came
the
two
sisters
these
ladies
though
not
elderly
were
and
perhaps
a
few
years
older
than
their
brother
they
were
austere
and
prim
of
aristocratic
features
and
patrician
air
but
they
were
almost
hysterical
in
their
excitement
a
distressed
maid
hovered
behind
them
with
sal
volatile
the
ladies
were
fully
attired
but
caps
on
their
heads
and
woolly
wraps
flung
round
them
bore
witness
to
hasty
dressing
what
is
it
cried
miss
rhoda
the
younger
of
the
two
what
has
happened
to
randolph
i
introduced
myself
to
them
i
told
them
as
gently
as
i
could
the
bare
facts
deeming
it
wise
to
make
no
prevarication
so
raptly
did
they
listen
and
so
earnestly
did
i
try
to
omit
horrible
details
and
yet
tell
the
truth
that
i
did
not
hear
schuyler
enter
the
room
but
she
did
come
in
and
heard
also
the
story
as
i
told
it
can
it
not
be
i
heard
a
soft
voice
behind
me
say
can
it
not
yet
be
there
is
some
mistake
who
says
that
man
is
my
husband
i
turned
to
see
the
white
face
and
clenched
hands
of
randolph
schuyler
widow
she
was
holding
herself
together
and
trying
to
get
a
gleam
of
hope
from
uncertainty
if
i
had
felt
pity
and
sorrow
for
her
before
i
saw
her
it
was
doubly
poignant
now
ruth
schuyler
was
one
of
those
gentle
appealing
women
helplessly
feminine
in
emergency
her
frightened
eyes
looked
out
of
a
small
pale
face
and
her
bloodless
lips
quivered
as
she
caught
them
between
her
teeth
in
an
effort
to
preserve
her
i
am
chester
calhoun
i
said
and
she
bowed
in
acknowledgment
i
am
junior
partner
in
the
firm
of
bradbury
and
calhoun
bradbury
is
one
of
your
husband
lawyers
and
also
a
friend
so
as
circumstances
brought
it
about
i
came
here
with
inspector
mason
to
tell
you
to
tell
you
schuyler
sank
into
a
seat
still
with
that
air
of
determination
to
be
calm
she
gripped
the
chair
arms
and
said
i
heard
you
tell
miss
schuyler
that
randolph
has
been
killed
i
ask
you
may
it
not
be
some
one
else
why
should
he
be
at
a
house
where
people
called
him
by
a
name
not
his
own
she
had
heard
then
all
i
had
told
the
older
ladies
for
schuyler
was
not
old
she
must
be
i
thought
at
once
years
younger
than
her
husband
perhaps
a
second
wife
i
was
glad
she
had
heard
for
it
saved
repeating
the
awful
narrative
he
has
not
been
identified
schuyler
i
said
except
by
the
policeman
of
this
precinct
who
declares
he
knows
him
well
i
was
glad
to
give
her
this
tiny
loophole
of
possibility
of
mistaken
identity
and
she
eagerly
grasped
at
it
you
must
make
sure
she
said
looking
at
inspector
mason
i
afraid
there
no
room
for
doubt
but
i
about
to
send
the
man
the
valet
over
to
see
him
do
you
wish
any
one
else
to
go
from
the
house
schuyler
shuddered
do
ask
me
to
go
she
said
piteously
for
i
ca
think
it
is
really
schuyler
and
if
it
should
be
oh
no
you
need
go
none
of
the
family
i
should
say
mason
looked
at
the
elder
ladies
no
no
cried
miss
sarah
we
could
think
of
it
but
let
jepson
go
he
is
a
most
reliable
man
yes
said
schuyler
send
cooper
and
jepson
both
oh
go
quickly
i
can
not
bear
this
suspense
she
turned
to
me
as
the
two
men
who
had
been
hovering
in
the
doorway
came
in
to
take
orders
i
thank
you
calhoun
it
was
truly
kind
of
you
to
come
tibbetts
get
me
a
wrap
please
this
was
schuyler
own
maid
who
went
on
the
errand
at
once
more
servants
had
gathered
one
or
two
footmen
a
silly
french
or
waitress
and
from
downstairs
i
heard
the
hushed
voices
of
others
tibbetts
returned
and
laid
a
fleecy
white
shawl
about
her
shoulders
schuyler
wore
a
house
dress
of
dull
blue
her
hair
of
an
hue
was
coiled
on
top
of
her
head
and
to
my
surprise
when
i
noticed
it
she
wore
a
string
of
large
pearls
round
her
throat
and
on
her
hands
were
two
rings
each
set
with
an
enormous
pearl
i
must
have
been
awkward
enough
to
glance
at
the
pearls
for
schuyler
remarked
i
dressed
so
hastily
i
kept
on
my
pearls
i
wear
them
at
night
sometimes
to
preserve
their
luster
then
she
apparently
forgot
them
for
without
she
turned
to
the
detective
and
began
asking
questions
nervously
she
inquired
concerning
minutest
details
and
i
surmised
that
side
by
side
with
her
grief
at
the
tragedy
was
a
very
human
and
feminine
dismay
at
the
thought
of
her
husband
stabbed
to
death
in
another
woman
house
who
is
miss
van
allen
she
asked
over
and
over
again
unsatisfied
with
the
scant
information
lowney
could
give
and
she
lives
near
here
just
down
the
side
street
who
she
i
do
think
she
is
anyone
you
ever
heard
of
i
said
to
her
she
is
a
pleasant
young
woman
and
so
far
as
i
know
all
that
is
correct
and
proper
then
why
would
she
have
randolph
schuyler
visiting
her
flashed
the
retort
is
that
correct
and
proper
it
may
be
so
i
said
for
i
felt
a
sort
of
loyalty
to
vicky
van
you
see
she
was
not
acquainted
with
schuyler
until
this
evening
why
did
he
go
there
then
steele
brought
him
norman
steele
i
do
know
any
mr
steele
i
began
to
think
that
randolph
schuyler
had
possessed
many
acquaintances
of
whom
his
wife
knew
nothing
and
i
concluded
to
see
bradbury
before
i
revealed
any
more
of
schuyler
affairs
and
then
lowney
began
adroitly
to
put
questions
instead
of
answering
them
he
inquired
concerning
schuyler
habits
and
pursuits
his
recreations
and
his
social
life
all
three
of
the
women
gave
responses
to
these
queries
and
i
learned
many
things
first
that
randolph
schuyler
was
one
manner
of
man
at
home
and
another
abroad
the
household
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
was
one
of
most
conservative
customs
and
rigidly
straightbacked
in
its
conventions
schuyler
was
not
a
second
wife
she
had
been
married
about
seven
years
and
had
lived
the
last
five
of
them
in
the
house
we
were
now
in
she
was
much
younger
than
her
husband
and
he
had
i
could
see
kept
her
from
all
knowledge
of
or
participation
in
his
bohemian
tastes
they
were
the
sort
of
people
who
have
a
box
at
the
opera
and
are
patrons
of
the
best
and
most
exclusive
functions
of
the
highest
society
schuyler
after
the
first
shock
recovered
her
poise
and
though
now
and
then
a
tremor
shook
her
slight
frame
she
bore
herself
with
dignity
and
calm
the
two
maiden
ladies
also
grew
quieter
but
we
all
nervously
awaited
the
return
of
the
butler
at
last
he
came
it
the
master
madame
he
said
simply
to
his
mistress
as
he
entered
the
room
he
is
dead
the
deferential
gravity
of
his
tone
impressed
me
anew
with
the
worth
and
i
felt
that
the
stricken
wife
had
a
tower
of
strength
in
the
faithful
servitor
i
left
cooper
there
madame
he
went
on
they
they
will
not
bring
schuyler
home
tonight
in
the
morning
perhaps
and
now
madame
will
you
not
go
to
rest
i
will
be
at
the
service
of
these
gentlemen
it
seemed
cruel
to
torture
them
further
that
night
and
the
three
ladies
were
dismissed
by
lowney
and
attended
by
their
maids
they
left
us
now
jepson
lowney
began
tell
us
all
you
know
about
schuyler
doings
i
daresay
you
know
as
much
as
the
valet
does
was
schuyler
as
a
man
of
the
world
different
from
his
life
in
this
house
jepson
looked
perturbed
that
not
for
me
to
say
sir
oh
yes
it
is
my
man
the
law
asks
you
and
it
is
for
you
to
tell
all
you
know
well
then
and
the
butler
weighed
his
words
my
master
was
always
most
strict
of
habit
in
his
home
the
ladies
are
very
reserved
and
abide
by
rules
and
standards
that
are
if
i
may
say
so
out
of
date
but
though
schuyler
was
by
no
means
a
gay
man
or
a
member
of
any
fast
set
yet
i
have
reason
to
think
sir
that
at
times
he
might
go
to
places
where
he
would
not
take
schuyler
and
where
he
would
not
wish
schuyler
to
know
he
had
been
himself
that
enough
said
lowney
i
got
his
number
now
jepson
had
your
master
any
enemies
that
you
know
of
not
that
i
know
of
but
i
know
nothing
of
schuyler
affairs
i
see
him
go
out
of
an
evening
and
i
may
notice
that
he
comes
in
very
late
but
as
to
his
friends
or
enemies
i
know
nothing
at
all
i
am
not
one
to
pry
sir
and
my
master
has
always
trusted
me
i
have
endeavored
not
to
betray
that
trust
this
might
have
sounded
pharisaical
in
a
man
of
less
sincerity
of
speech
but
jepson
clear
straightforward
eyes
forbade
any
doubt
of
his
honesty
and
truth
again
i
was
glad
that
schuyler
had
this
staunch
helper
at
her
side
for
i
foresaw
troublous
times
in
store
for
her
and
you
never
heard
of
this
miss
van
allen
never
was
in
her
house
before
never
sir
i
know
nothing
of
the
houses
on
the
side
blocks
i
winced
at
this
of
course
i
know
the
people
who
come
to
this
house
but
there
is
among
them
no
miss
van
allen
rather
not
i
thought
to
myself
and
then
i
sighed
at
the
memory
of
vicky
van
had
she
killed
this
millionaire
and
if
so
why
i
was
sure
vicky
had
never
met
randolph
schuyler
before
that
evening
i
had
seen
their
meeting
and
it
was
too
surely
the
glance
of
stranger
to
stranger
that
had
passed
between
them
to
make
a
previous
acquaintance
possible
vicky
had
been
charming
to
him
as
she
always
was
to
every
one
but
she
showed
no
special
interest
and
if
she
did
really
kill
him
it
was
some
unguessable
motive
that
prompted
the
deed
i
thought
it
over
schuyler
at
the
club
dined
and
wined
had
perhaps
heard
norman
steele
extol
the
charms
of
vicky
van
interested
he
had
asked
to
be
taken
to
vicky
house
but
as
it
was
so
near
his
own
a
sense
of
precaution
led
him
to
adopt
another
name
then
the
inexplicable
sequel
and
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
vicky
herself
though
of
course
the
girl
would
return
as
reeves
had
said
doubtless
she
had
witnessed
the
crime
and
scared
out
of
her
wits
had
run
away
her
return
would
clear
up
the
matter
then
the
waiter
story
well
there
was
much
to
be
done
and
as
i
suddenly
bethought
me
it
was
time
i
myself
went
home
as
i
passed
vicky
van
house
on
my
way
home
i
saw
lights
pretty
much
all
over
it
and
was
strongly
tempted
to
go
in
but
common
sense
told
me
i
needed
rest
and
not
only
did
i
have
many
matters
to
attend
to
on
the
morrow
but
i
had
to
tell
the
story
to
aunt
lucy
and
winnie
that
of
itself
would
require
some
thought
and
tactful
management
for
i
was
not
willing
to
have
them
condemn
vicky
van
entirely
and
yet
i
could
think
of
no
argument
to
put
forth
for
the
innocence
time
alone
must
tell
chapter
vi
vicky
ways
get
up
this
minute
there
a
reporter
downstairs
a
reporter
my
sleepy
eyes
opened
to
find
winnie
pounding
my
shoulder
as
it
humped
beneath
the
blanket
hey
what
i
grunted
trying
to
collect
my
perceptions
a
if
winnie
had
said
a
bengal
tiger
she
could
have
looked
more
terrified
great
scott
win
i
remember
clear
out
i
be
down
in
a
minute
i
dressed
in
record
time
and
went
downstairs
in
three
leaps
in
the
library
i
found
aunt
lucy
wearing
an
expression
that
she
might
have
shown
if
the
garbage
man
had
asked
her
to
a
dance
but
winnie
was
eagerly
drinking
in
the
story
poured
forth
by
the
said
reporter
who
was
quite
evidently
enjoying
his
audience
oh
chet
this
is
bemis
of
he
telling
us
all
about
the
you
know
what
happened
winnie
was
too
timid
to
say
the
word
and
i
was
sorry
she
had
to
hear
the
awful
tale
from
any
one
but
myself
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
and
i
joined
the
group
and
did
all
i
could
to
bring
aunt
lucy
eyebrows
and
nose
down
to
their
accustomed
levels
but
it
an
awful
story
make
the
best
of
it
and
the
truth
had
to
be
told
it
is
appalling
conceded
aunt
lucy
at
length
but
the
most
regrettable
circumstance
to
my
mind
is
your
connection
with
it
all
chester
now
auntie
have
a
little
heart
for
poor
schuyler
and
those
old
lady
sisters
also
for
the
man
himself
oh
i
have
chet
i
not
inhuman
but
those
things
are
in
the
papers
every
day
and
while
one
feels
a
general
sympathy
it
ca
be
personal
if
one
does
know
the
people
but
for
you
to
be
mixed
up
in
such
matters
i
was
mixed
up
in
it
aunt
lucy
except
as
i
chose
to
mix
myself
and
i
no
doubt
i
should
have
gotten
into
it
anyway
bradbury
will
have
a
lot
to
do
with
it
i
sure
i
no
better
than
he
to
mix
in
in
a
business
way
yes
but
you
were
there
socially
where
a
murder
was
committed
aunt
lucy
could
have
shown
no
more
horror
of
it
all
if
i
had
been
the
convicted
criminal
and
i
glad
i
was
i
cried
losing
patience
a
little
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
to
the
schuyler
people
or
to
miss
van
allen
i
shall
be
willing
to
do
all
i
can
but
miss
van
allen
is
the
the
murderer
and
aunt
lucy
whispered
the
word
do
say
that
i
cried
sharply
you
do
know
it
at
all
and
there
no
reason
to
condemn
the
girl
i
paused
bemis
was
taking
in
my
every
word
with
a
canny
understanding
of
what
i
said
and
also
of
what
i
did
say
where
do
your
suspicions
tend
mr
calhoun
he
said
smoothly
frankly
bemis
i
do
know
i
am
an
acquaintance
of
miss
van
allen
and
i
can
not
reconcile
the
idea
of
crime
with
her
happy
gentle
nature
nor
can
i
see
any
reason
to
suspect
the
waiter
who
first
told
of
the
matter
but
might
not
some
person
some
enemy
of
schuyler
have
been
secreted
in
the
house
a
plausible
theory
agreed
bemis
even
an
obvious
one
but
almost
no
chance
of
it
i
seen
the
caterer
people
and
they
were
in
charge
of
the
basement
rooms
and
the
all
the
evening
unless
it
were
one
of
the
guests
at
the
party
i
think
no
intruder
could
have
gotten
in
well
i
returned
uneasily
for
i
wished
he
would
go
it
is
up
to
us
to
invent
theories
or
to
defend
them
i
will
answer
your
necessary
questions
but
pardon
me
if
i
remind
you
that
i
am
a
busy
man
and
i
have
yet
had
my
breakfast
bemis
took
the
hint
and
after
a
string
of
definite
and
pertinent
questions
he
left
winnie
tried
to
detain
him
but
my
curt
courtesy
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
linger
oh
chessy
cried
my
sister
as
soon
as
bemis
had
gone
it
awful
i
know
but
it
exciting
hush
winnie
reproved
aunt
lucy
a
girl
of
your
age
should
know
nothing
of
these
things
and
i
want
you
to
put
it
out
of
your
mind
you
can
be
of
no
help
and
i
do
not
want
your
nerves
disturbed
by
the
harrowing
details
that
all
right
aunt
lucy
i
put
in
but
this
is
going
to
be
a
celebrated
case
and
winnie
ca
be
kept
in
ignorance
of
its
developments
now
be
a
good
sort
auntie
accept
the
inevitable
try
to
realize
that
i
must
do
what
seems
to
me
my
duty
and
if
that
brings
us
more
or
less
into
the
limelight
of
publicity
it
is
a
pity
but
it
ca
be
helped
i
agree
to
all
that
chester
dear
but
you
are
so
mixed
in
it
socially
why
did
you
ever
get
into
that
set
it
is
a
bad
set
aunt
lu
it
is
a
fast
set
by
any
means
you
would
see
winnie
or
me
there
no
but
a
decent
man
goes
to
places
where
he
would
take
his
women
people
now
let
up
auntie
trust
your
nevvy
and
just
do
all
you
can
to
help
by
doing
nothing
i
help
you
i
do
exactly
as
you
tell
me
if
only
let
me
know
about
it
and
not
treat
me
like
a
baby
said
winnie
who
was
wheedlesomely
assisting
my
breakfast
arrangements
she
sugared
and
creamed
my
cereal
and
as
i
dispatched
it
she
buttered
toast
and
poured
coffee
and
deftly
sliced
off
the
top
of
a
egg
i
managed
to
eat
some
of
these
viands
between
answers
to
their
volley
of
questions
and
at
last
i
made
ready
to
go
down
town
and
remember
i
said
as
i
departed
if
a
lot
of
gossippy
old
hens
come
around
here
or
your
chicken
friends
winnie
do
tell
them
a
thing
let
get
it
from
the
papers
or
apply
to
information
or
any
old
way
but
do
you
two
give
out
a
line
of
talk
see
i
kissed
them
both
and
started
off
of
course
i
went
over
to
vicky
van
first
i
had
been
on
the
proverbial
pins
and
needles
to
get
there
ever
since
i
woke
to
consciousness
by
reason
of
the
sisterly
pounding
that
brought
me
from
the
land
of
dreams
the
house
had
an
inhabited
look
and
when
i
went
in
i
was
greeted
by
the
odor
of
boiling
coffee
come
right
down
here
called
reeves
from
the
basement
i
went
down
passing
the
closed
door
with
a
shudder
two
or
three
policemen
were
about
in
charge
of
things
generally
but
none
whom
i
knew
they
had
been
relieved
for
the
present
you
still
here
i
said
a
little
inanely
yes
returned
reeves
who
looked
tired
and
wan
i
stayed
you
know
but
i
could
sleep
any
i
lay
down
on
the
couch
but
i
only
dozed
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
i
kept
hearing
strange
sounds
or
imagining
i
did
and
the
police
were
back
and
forth
till
nearly
daylight
downstairs
they
were
i
did
bother
them
but
they
knew
i
was
in
the
house
if
if
vicky
should
come
home
her
face
was
wistful
and
her
eyes
very
sad
i
looked
my
sympathy
you
liked
her
i
know
she
went
on
but
everybody
has
turned
against
her
since
they
found
the
man
was
randolph
schuyler
all
sympathy
is
for
him
and
his
widow
they
all
condemn
vicky
you
can
scarcely
blame
them
i
began
but
she
interrupted
i
do
blame
them
they
no
right
to
accuse
that
girl
unheard
the
waiter
oh
yes
i
know
the
waiter
well
do
let
quarrel
about
it
i
ca
stay
here
much
longer
though
i
made
coffee
and
got
myself
some
breakfast
but
honest
calhoun
it
pretty
nearly
choked
me
to
eat
sandwiches
that
had
been
made
for
last
night
surprise
supper
i
should
think
it
would
did
any
rolls
come
or
milk
you
know
i
did
see
any
well
i
go
home
this
morning
but
i
shall
telephone
up
here
every
little
while
the
police
will
stay
here
i
suppose
yes
for
a
day
or
two
do
you
think
vicky
will
come
back
i
do
know
she
have
to
sooner
or
later
i
tried
to
make
myself
sleep
in
her
room
last
night
but
i
just
could
so
i
stayed
in
the
music
room
i
thought
i
suppose
it
was
foolish
but
i
thought
maybe
she
might
telephone
she
hardly
do
that
i
do
know
it
impossible
to
say
she
might
do
oh
the
whole
thing
is
impossible
think
of
it
calhoun
where
could
that
girl
have
gone
alone
at
midnight
in
that
gorgeous
gown
no
hat
or
wrap
how
do
you
know
that
i
do
not
positively
but
if
she
had
put
on
wraps
and
gone
out
by
either
door
she
would
surely
have
been
seen
by
some
one
in
the
house
i
just
sure
she
did
go
out
by
the
front
street
door
for
we
in
the
must
have
noticed
her
and
she
could
have
gone
out
by
the
area
door
for
there
were
waiters
all
about
down
here
we
were
sitting
in
the
front
basement
room
a
pleasant
enough
place
evidently
a
servants
sitting
room
before
reeves
on
the
table
were
the
remnants
of
her
scarce
tasted
breakfast
as
she
had
said
the
tiny
sandwiches
and
rich
salad
which
she
had
procured
from
the
unused
stores
of
the
caterer
provision
did
seem
too
closely
connected
with
the
tragedy
to
be
appetizing
the
kitchen
is
back
of
this
i
asked
yes
and
dumb
waiters
to
the
i
confess
i
looked
about
a
bit
i
not
a
prying
woman
but
i
felt
i
was
justified
you
certainly
are
reeves
i
said
warmly
for
she
was
thoroughly
and
a
staunch
friend
of
vicky
van
have
you
learned
anything
illuminating
no
but
things
are
queer
queer
how
well
you
would
understand
a
man
could
but
it
this
way
lots
of
potted
meats
and
jars
of
jam
and
cans
of
tea
and
coffee
and
cocoa
in
the
pantry
but
no
fresh
meat
or
green
vegetables
about
no
butter
in
the
icebox
and
no
eggs
or
bacon
well
what
does
that
imply
i
no
housekeeper
i
admit
it
looks
to
me
as
if
vicky
was
leaving
this
morning
i
mean
as
if
she
had
expected
to
go
away
and
so
had
no
stuff
on
hand
to
spoil
perhaps
this
is
her
market
day
no
it
queer
that
what
it
is
you
know
sometimes
vicky
does
go
away
for
days
at
a
time
has
she
a
right
to
of
course
she
has
i
thinking
it
out
where
does
she
go
and
wherever
it
is
that
where
she
is
now
reeves
triumphant
air
seemed
to
settle
the
question
but
all
that
is
queer
my
dear
lady
i
said
we
all
know
vicky
van
gads
about
a
lot
i
telephoned
her
myself
twice
and
she
here
once
julie
answered
and
once
there
was
no
response
of
any
sort
yes
i
suppose
that
the
case
she
was
going
away
on
a
visit
maybe
and
so
had
little
food
on
hand
to
be
disposed
of
a
good
housekeeper
would
look
after
that
of
course
it
would
be
doing
but
julie
that
housekeeper
is
a
treasure
she
could
run
a
hotel
if
she
wanted
to
then
perhaps
i
mused
aloud
vicky
ran
away
and
went
to
the
place
wherever
it
is
that
she
expected
to
visit
oh
i
do
know
this
is
all
merely
conjecture
and
too
how
could
she
in
that
dress
no
she
has
gone
to
some
friend
in
town
she
must
have
done
so
a
hotel
would
take
her
in
why
reeves
voice
broke
you
know
that
waiter
said
there
there
was
blood
on
gown
do
you
believe
that
if
we
believe
him
at
all
why
should
we
believe
the
whole
tale
i
do
know
vicky
van
you
understand
except
as
a
casual
friend
i
mean
i
know
nothing
of
her
family
her
past
or
her
personality
except
as
i
seen
her
in
a
friendly
way
i
like
her
thoroughly
but
i
ca
honestly
say
that
i
know
her
who
does
nobody
all
her
friends
say
the
same
thing
she
is
lovely
and
dear
but
never
confidential
or
communicative
regarding
herself
wherever
she
went
julie
must
be
with
her
i
suggested
i
do
know
i
dare
say
that
is
so
but
how
on
earth
could
women
get
out
of
this
house
without
its
being
known
and
yet
they
did
whether
alone
or
together
they
both
got
away
last
night
you
do
think
they
still
concealed
in
the
house
oh
no
of
course
not
after
the
search
we
made
i
ca
help
thinking
they
turn
up
julie
anyway
why
miss
van
allen
must
come
back
or
send
back
for
her
valuables
i
saw
jewelry
and
money
in
the
yes
but
of
course
they
safe
enough
they
all
in
care
of
the
police
we
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
policeman
and
a
woman
who
had
come
to
work
she
says
the
policeman
addressed
reeves
that
she
was
expected
here
to
clean
now
we
ca
let
her
disturb
things
much
but
she
better
wash
up
a
little
and
throw
away
some
of
the
supper
stuff
that
wo
keep
everybody
seemed
to
look
to
reeves
as
a
sort
of
proxy
housekeeper
and
i
wondered
what
they
would
have
done
without
her
though
i
suppose
they
would
have
managed
yes
indeed
was
her
glad
response
let
her
tidy
up
these
breakfast
things
i
used
and
there
some
cups
and
plates
in
the
kitchen
for
i
gave
those
poor
policemen
some
food
three
this
morning
and
she
can
throw
out
the
melted
ice
cream
it
no
good
to
anybody
and
it
surely
is
evidence
i
determined
to
ask
the
some
questions
but
the
police
forestalled
me
ferrall
came
down
and
joined
us
and
spoke
to
her
at
once
good
morning
flaherty

flaherty
never

your
personal
feelings
in
a
hurry
ferrall
was
busy
making
notes
of
the
information
he
was
getting
and
i
could
well
understand
that
any
on
home
life
was
of
importance
so
i
tarried
to
listen
how
long
have
you
worked
for
miss
van
allen
a
matther
av
a
year
or
more
you
clean
the
rooms
upstairs
sometimes
all
over
the
house
manny
the
time
i
shwept
an
vacuumed
miss
van
allen
own
bedroom
an
boodore
an
likewise
the
music
room
parlure
an
all
yis
sor
i
here
frekint
what
other
servants
does
miss
van
allen
employ
nobody
that
lives
in
miss
julie
but
there
the
laundry
woman
as
comes
though
more
often
the
wash
goes
out
thin
there
a
chore
boy
as
runs
arrants
an
sometimes
a
sewin

it
good

chipper
an
merry
an
glad
to
see
her
friends
an
thin
all
of
a
suddint
up
an
off
agin
i
knew
that
was
vicky
van
habit
all
that
the
woman
said
corroborated
my
idea
of
the
little
butterfly
frivolous
life
so
why
should
she
keep
permanent
servants
if
she
was
at
home
only
half
the
time
i
knew
the
troubles
aunt
lucy
had
with
her
menials
and
i
approved
of
vicky
wisdom
and
that
explains
the
empty
icebox
reeves
was
saying
nodding
her
head
in
satisfaction
vicky
meant
to
go
off
after
the
house
was
put
in
order
and
she
did
want
a
lot
of
food
left
to
spoil
yis
mum
agreed
flaherty
shall
i
wash
thim
dishes
now
mum
and
she
was
allowed
to
set
to
work
chapter
vii
ruth
schuyler
there
were
many
calls
on
vicky
van
telephone
that
morning
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
bell
rang
almost
continually
the
police
people
answered
it
and
one
time
i
was
surprised
to
learn
that
the
call
was
for
me
i
took
up
the
receiver
and
heard
bradbury
voice
i
called
up
your
home
he
said
and
your
sister
told
me
to
try
this
number
now
look
here
calhoun
i
wish
you
go
to
see
schuyler
i
talked
with
her
over
the
telephone
and
she
asked
me
to
come
up
there
but
i
got
the
crittendon
case
on
this
morning
and
i
get
away
very
well
so
you
go
and
see
what
you
can
do
for
her
she
told
me
you
were
there
last
night
and
she
willing
to
have
you
in
my
place
i
agreed
feeling
rather
flattered
that
the
rich
man
widow
should
so
readily
accept
me
as
bradbury
substitute
i
sorry
you
going
there
said
reeves
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
as
i
took
leave
of
her
of
course
the
schuylers
will
pump
you
about
vicky
and
try
to
make
you
say
that
she
killed
that
man
i
must
tell
schuyler
the
truth
i
said
yes
but
ca
you
give
vicky
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
there
is
a
doubt
why
should
she
kill
a
man
she
never
had
seen
before
perhaps
he
was
a
stranger
to
her
after
all
why
i
heard
her
say
before
he
came
that
she
did
know
him
you
heard
her
say
she
did
know
somers
i
corrected
been
thinking
this
thing
over
suppose
vicky
did
know
schuyler
and
when
steele
proposed
bringing
a
somers
no
you
all
wrong
she
exclaimed
i
saw
them
when
they
met
and
i
sure
they
had
never
laid
eyes
on
each
other
before
there
was
not
the
least
sign
of
recognition
besides
that
is
like
vicky
to
have
a
millionaire
and
a
married
man
for
her
friend
that
girl
is
all
right
calhoun
and
i
do
want
you
to
let
schuyler
think
she
is
perhaps
schuyler
knows
something
about
her
i
doubt
it
anyway
you
stand
up
for
vicky
as
far
as
you
can
do
so
honestly
wo
you
i
can
surely
promise
that
i
replied
as
i
started
on
my
errand
approaching
the
fifth
avenue
residence
i
looked
at
the
house
which
i
had
been
unable
to
see
clearly
the
night
before
it
was
large
and
handsome
but
not
one
of
the
most
modern
mansions
four
stories
it
was
and
as
i
glanced
up
i
noticed
that
all
the
window
shades
were
down
the
floral
emblem
of
death
hung
at
one
side
of
the
wide
entrance
and
as
i
approached
the
door
silently
swung
open
a
footman
was
in
charge
and
i
was
ushered
at
once
to
the
library
where
i
had
been
some
hours
earlier
it
was
not
a
cheerful
room
the
appointments
were
heavy
and
somber
though
evidently
the
woods
and
fabrics
were
of
great
value
a
shaded
electrolier
gave
a
dim
light
for
the
drawn
blinds
precluded
daylight
a
soft
step
and
schuyler
came
into
the
room
black
garb
was
not
becoming
to
her
the
night
before
in
her
blue
she
had
looked
almost
pretty
but
now
in
a
black
gown
without
even
a
bit
of
relieving
white
at
her
throat
she
was
plain
and
very
pathetic
her
face
was
pale
and
drawn
and
her
eyes
showed
dark
shadows
as
of
utter
weariness
she
greeted
me
simply
and
glided
to
a
nearby
chair
it
is
kind
of
you
to
come
calhoun
and
the
fine
quality
of
her
voice
and
inflection
betokened
new
england
ancestry
or
training
as
you
were
here
last
night
you
seem
more
like
a
friend
than
a
mere
business
acquaintance
i
am
very
glad
schuyler
and
i
spoke
sincerely
that
you
look
on
me
like
that
please
tell
me
anything
you
wish
to
and
command
me
in
any
way
i
can
serve
you
the
speech
sounded
a
little
stilted
i
knew
but
there
was
something
about
ruth
schuyler
that
called
for
dignified
address
she
had
the
air
of
bewildered
helplessness
that
always
appeals
to
a
man
but
she
had
too
a
look
of
determination
as
to
one
who
would
do
the
right
thing
at
any
cost
of
personal
unpleasantness
it
is
all
so
dreadful
she
began
and
an
insuppressible
sob
threatened
her
speech
but
she
controlled
it
and
went
on
there
is
so
much
to
be
gone
through
with
and
i
am
so
ignorant
of
of
law
and
you
know
of
police
doings
i
understand
i
returned
and
anything
that
you
can
be
spared
rest
assured
you
shall
be
but
there
is
much
ahead
of
you
that
will
be
hard
for
you
very
hard
and
perhaps
i
can
help
you
get
ready
for
it
will
there
be
an
inquest
and
all
that
she
whispered
the
word
half
fearfully
yes
there
must
be
though
not
for
several
days
probably
you
know
they
ca
find
miss
van
allen
no
where
can
she
be
i
do
suppose
they
will
ever
find
her
why
should
she
kill
my
husband
have
you
any
theory
calhoun
how
well
did
you
know
this
this
person
only
fairly
well
by
which
i
mean
i
have
met
her
some
half
a
dozen
times
always
in
her
own
house
not
always
i
attended
studio
parties
where
she
was
present
oh
bohemian
affairs
not
exactly
miss
van
allen
is
a
delightful
girl
bright
and
of
merry
spirits
but
in
no
way
fast
or
of
questionable
habits
that
what
they
tell
me
but
pardon
me
if
i
can
not
believe
a
really
nice
correct
young
woman
would
have
a
married
man
visiting
her
but
remember
schuyler
miss
van
allen
did
not
invite
schuyler
to
her
house
as
near
as
we
can
make
out
steele
brought
him
without
miss
van
allen
permission
and
under
an
assumed
name
a
blush
of
shame
stained
her
face
i
realize
she
said
how
that
reflects
against
my
husband
must
all
this
be
made
public
mr
calhoun
i
fear
it
must
the
law
is
inexorable
in
its
demands
for
justice
but
if
they
ca
find
miss
van
allen
how
can
they
indict
her
or
whatever
the
term
is
why
ca
the
whole
affair
be
hushed
up
personally
i
would
far
rather
never
find
the
girl
never
have
her
punished
than
to
drag
the
schuyler
name
through
the
horrors
of
a
murder
trial
i
quite
understand
your
position
but
it
will
not
be
possible
to
evade
the
legal
proceedings
of
course
if
miss
van
allen
is
never
found
the
affair
must
remain
a
mystery
but
she
will
be
found
a
lady
like
that
ca
drop
out
of
existence
no
of
course
not
why
her
bills
must
be
paid
her
household
effects
looked
after
is
she
in
a
house
or
an
apartment
a
house
i
understand
she
owns
it
then
she
must
communicate
with
her
business
people
lawyer
bank
or
creditors
ca
you
trace
her
that
way
we
hope
to
as
you
say
she
must
surely
return
to
attend
to
such
matters
and
her
servants
what
do
they
say
i
described
the
unusual
menage
that
vicky
van
supported
and
schuyler
was
interested
how
strange
she
said
she
sounds
to
me
like
an
adventuress
no
she
is
that
she
has
money
enough
where
does
she
get
it
i
do
know
i
sure
but
she
is
a
quiet
little
person
and
not
at
all
of
the
adventuress
type
it
does
matter
and
schuyler
sighed
i
do
care
anything
about
her
personality
she
must
be
bad
or
she
would
have
killed
my
husband
i
not
defending
him
but
men
do
go
to
the
houses
of
complete
strangers
and
get
murdered
by
them
and
i
hope
she
will
never
be
found
for
it
might
bring
out
a
story
of
scandal
or
shame
that
will
always
cling
to
schuyler
memory
but
of
course
she
will
come
back
and
she
will
plead
innocence
and
lay
all
blame
on
schuyler
ca
we
buy
her
off
i
would
pay
a
large
sum
to
keep
her
story
from
the
world
i
sorry
schuyler
but
that
ca
be
done
i
thought
you
would
help
me
i
so
disappointed
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
her
voice
trembled
i
wished
bradbury
had
had
this
job
instead
of
myself
for
i
am
where
feminine
appeal
is
concerned
and
i
did
know
quite
what
to
say
but
just
then
the
two
schuyler
sisters
came
into
the
library
and
i
rose
to
greet
them
oh
cried
miss
rhoda
it
all
too
awful
we
ca
believe
it
i
wish
i
had
that
girl
here
you
must
find
her
calhoun
you
must
yes
chimed
in
miss
sarah
she
must
be
brought
to
judgment
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
life
for
a
life
that
the
scripture
law
do
talk
so
sarah
pleaded
ruth
schuyler
it
wo
bring
randolph
back
to
punish
his
murderer
and
think
of
the
awful
publicity
i
do
care
for
that
murder
has
been
done
and
murder
must
be
avenged
i
ashamed
of
you
ruth
if
you
let
any
idea
of
personal
distaste
stand
in
the
way
of
righteous
law
and
order
i
too
agreed
rhoda
spare
no
effort
or
expense
calhoun
to
find
that
wicked
girl
and
have
her
arrested
i
daresay
you
are
right
and
schuyler
acquiescence
showed
her
to
be
more
or
less
under
the
iron
hand
of
the
family
opinion
of
course
if
you
feel
that
way
i
shall
raise
no
obstacle
to
the
progress
whatever
you
advise
rhoda
i
agree
to
certainly
you
do
you
are
young
ruth
and
you
are
not
a
schuyler
why
the
very
name
demands
the
strongest
powers
of
the
law
i
only
fear
that
the
most
desperate
efforts
may
not
succeed
what
is
your
opinion
calhoun
can
they
find
that
woman
the
scorn
of
the
last
two
words
as
uttered
by
rhoda
schuyler
sharp
tongue
is
not
to
be
reproduced
in
print
i
think
most
probably
yes
miss
schuyler
i
think
she
must
return
sooner
or
later
do
wait
for
that
exclaimed
sarah
send
people
to
search
for
her
scour
the
country
do
let
her
get
away
beyond
retrieval
offer
a
reward
if
necessary
but
get
her
a
reward
repeated
rhoda
yes
that
it
put
it
in
the
paper
at
once
a
large
reward
for
any
information
of
miss
van
allen
stay
i
urged
do
decide
on
such
measures
too
hastily
might
you
not
defeat
your
own
purpose
miss
van
allen
doubtless
will
see
the
papers
wherever
she
may
be
if
she
learns
of
the
reward
she
will
hide
herself
more
securely
than
ever
i
think
so
too
said
ruth
in
her
gentle
voice
i
am
sure
rhoda
we
ought
to
do
anything
like
that
just
yet
oh
how
hard
it
is
to
know
what
to
do
yes
we
always
deferred
everything
to
randolph
how
can
we
get
along
without
him
we
must
and
schuyler
set
her
pale
lips
together
in
an
evident
determination
to
be
brave
and
strong
now
calhoun
what
is
there
to
be
discussed
in
a
business
way
i
mean
regarding
business
with
you
or
mr
bradbury
nothing
at
present
i
returned
feeling
sure
the
poor
woman
had
quite
enough
on
her
mind
the
will
can
be
examined
at
your
convenience
and
any
questions
of
securities
or
money
can
rest
over
for
a
time
do
you
wish
any
ready
cash
or
shall
we
look
after
any
money
matters
thank
you
no
such
things
are
systematically
arranged
in
the
household
jepson
attends
to
bills
and
tradesmen
my
greatest
wish
is
for
a
secretary
or
some
person
to
write
notes
and
look
after
the
flood
of
letters
and
telegrams
that
has
already
begun
i
felt
surprised
for
i
had
assumed
that
the
rich
man
wife
had
a
social
secretary
of
her
own
i
no
one
she
said
in
response
to
my
glance
schuyler
did
wish
me
to
have
a
secretary
and
indeed
i
did
need
one
but
now
of
course
it
is
necessary
now
not
at
all
interrupted
miss
rhoda
i
am
surprised
at
you
ruth
you
know
how
randolph
objected
to
such
things
and
now
as
soon
as
he
is
gone
you
begin
to
hush
rhoda
said
ruth
with
gentle
dignity
it
was
not
necessary
before
but
it
is
now
you
no
idea
what
a
task
it
will
be
all
our
friends
and
many
of
randolph
acquaintances
will
call
or
send
messages
and
they
must
be
acknowledged
and
pray
what
else
have
you
to
do
but
acknowledge
them

and
i
will
attend
to
our
own
a
great
many
doubtless
but
not
too
much
of
a
task
for
us
when
it
is
in
memory
of
our
dear
brother
very
well
and
ruth
spoke
calmly
we
will
wait
for
a
day
or
two
calhoun
and
then
if
as
i
believe
the
matter
requires
further
consideration
we
will
discuss
it
again
clever
woman
i
thought
to
myself
she
is
altogether
chummy
with
those
old
maid
sisters
and
yet
she
knows
better
than
to
have
any
open
disagreement
i
bet
she
gets
her
secretary
when
she
gets
ready
for
one
i
be
on
the
lookout
for
the
right
girl
for
her
when
will
they
bring
my
husband
home
she
continued
without
waiting
for
comment
on
her
decision
about
the
secretary
some
time
i
returned
looking
commiseratingly
at
the
harassed
white
face
probably
this
afternoon
can
i
take
any
message
regarding
the
funeral
arrangements
not
yet
and
ruth
schuyler
shuddered
those
details
are
so
terrible
terrible
yes
said
miss
sarah
but
they
must
be
looked
after
we
will
see
the
undertaker
men
ruth
i
think
rhoda
and
i
will
know
better
what
is
fit
and
proper
for
randolph
burial
ceremonies
than
you
possibly
can
i
began
to
realize
that
the
sisters
had
a
family
pride
which
did
not
include
their
brother
wife
in
their
councils
apparently
she
was
or
they
deemed
her
of
lesser
birth
or
social
standing
personally
however
i
greatly
preferred
the
gentle
kindliness
of
the
widow
to
the
aristocratic
hauteur
of
the
sisters
ruth
schuyler
made
no
objection
to
the
proposition
and
seemed
relieved
that
her
advice
would
not
be
required
who
is
in
the
house
where
schuyler
was
where
he
died
she
asked
hesitatingly
only
the
police
i
answered
unless
miss
van
allen
has
returned
were
were
there
many
people
there
last
night
clearly
she
wanted
to
know
more
details
of
the
occasion
but
like
to
show
curiosity
yes
i
informed
her
quite
a
number
it
was
miss
van
birthday
and
so
a
sort
of
little
celebration
her
birthday
how
old
was
she
i
no
idea
i
should
guess
about
or
is
she
is
what
does
she
look
like
the
eternal
feminine
wanted
to
ask
is
she
pretty
but
ruth
schuyler
dignity
scarcely
permitted
the
question
i
noticed
too
that
the
sisters
listened
attentively
for
my
reply
yes
i
said
truthfully
she
is
pretty
she
is
small
with
very
black
hair
and
large
dark
gray
eyes
she
is
exceedingly
chic
and
as
to
costumes
and
is
of
vivacious
and
charming
manner
humph
sniffed
miss
rhoda
an
actress
not
at
all
victoria
van
allen
is
a
lady
if
there
ever
was
one
you
are
a
staunch
friend
calhoun
and
schuyler
looked
her
surprise
i
speak
only
as
i
feel
i
ca
say
surely
that
miss
van
allen
did
not
commit
this
crime
for
i
know
there
is
evidence
against
her
but
i
ca
reconcile
the
deed
with
her
character
as
i
know
it
and
i
for
one
shall
wait
further
developments
before
i
condemn
her
but
of
course
schuyler
my
personal
feelings
in
the
matter
have
no
weight
in
law
and
i
stand
ready
to
obey
whatever
orders
you
may
give
in
connection
with
a
search
for
the
missing
girl
i
do
know
exactly
what
i
do
want
done
yet
calhoun
and
ruth
schuyler
glanced
deferringly
toward
the
sisters
no
we
do
for
once
sarah
agreed
with
ruth
after
the
funeral
we
can
set
our
minds
to
the
finding
of
the
criminal
of
course
the
police
will
do
all
they
can
meantime
to
trace
her
of
course
and
such
a
plan
is
best
she
may
return
to
a
house
guarded
by
police
asked
ruth
possibly
if
she
is
innocent
why
not
innocent
exclaimed
miss
rhoda
with
utmost
scorn
some
of
her
friends
think
her
so
i
observed
reeves
a
lady
who
was
at
the
party
stayed
in
the
house
all
night
and
is
i
think
there
still
why
did
she
do
that
asked
schuyler
looking
puzzled
she
hoped
miss
van
allen
would
return
and
she
waited
there
to
look
after
her
that
was
kind
who
is
this
lady
she
lives
down
on
washington
square
i
only
know
her
slightly
but
she
is
a
and
a
most
capable
and
sensible
one
she
refuses
to
believe
that
vicky
van
what
do
you
call
her
her
friends
call
her
vicky
van
it
it
sort
of
suits
her
from
what
you
say
i
judge
she
is
not
the
terror
i
thought
her
at
first
but
all
the
same
she
murdered
my
husband
and
i
can
not
look
on
her
as
you
seem
to
nor
can
i
blame
you
your
feelings
toward
her
are
entirely
just
mrs
schuyler
chapter
viii
the
it
a
queer
case
said
bradbury
to
me
when
i
reached
the
office
that
afternoon
of
course
i
know
randolph
schuyler
was
no
saint
but
i
never
supposed
he
was
deep
enough
in
any
affair
to
have
a
woman
kill
him
and
so
near
his
own
home
too
he
might
have
had
the
decency
to
choose
his
lady
acquaintances
in
more
remote
sections
of
the
city
that
is
the
queerest
part
to
me
i
returned
what
i
understand
is
why
that
girl
stabbed
him
she
did
know
him
now
now
calhoun
she
must
have
known
him
she
did
know
any
somers
we
say
but
she
must
have
known
schuyler
a
murder
has
to
have
a
motive
she
had
provided
herself
with
that
knife
beforehand
you
see
and
she
got
him
out
to
the
purposely
i
ca
think
it
i
said
and
i
sighed
i
know
vicky
van
fairly
well
and
she
would
you
ca
say
what
a
woman
would
or
would
do
but
it
not
our
business
to
look
after
the
criminal
part
of
it
we
got
all
we
can
handle
attending
to
the
estate
and
here
another
thing
i
wish
you
do
all
that
necessary
up
at
the
house
i
always
got
along
all
right
with
randolph
schuyler
but
i
ca
stand
those
sisters
of
his
his
wife
i
have
never
met
but
those
old
schuyler
women
get
on
my
nerves
so
you
look
after
them
you
more
of
a
ladies
man
than
i
am
so
you
go
there
and
talk
pretty
when
they
want
legal
advice
i
willing
i
agreed
i
do
care
such
a
lot
for
the
sisters
myself
but
schuyler
is
a
young
thing
ignorant
of
her
own
rights
and
those
old
maids
boss
her
like
fury
i
going
to
see
that
she
has
her
own
way
in
some
few
things
at
least
she
inherits
half
the
fortune
you
know
yes
and
the
sisters
a
quarter
each
that
is
after
some
minor
bequests
and
charitable
donations
are
settled
schuyler
was
a
good
sort
as
men
go
then
men
go
pretty
badly
he
was
a
brute
to
his
wife
i
been
told
he
ruled
her
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
what
he
did
bother
her
about
the
old
sisters
did
that
neither
here
nor
there
do
you
try
to
be
a
peacemaker
in
that
family
i
know
those
two
old
ladies
and
they
resent
anything
in
the
way
of
criticism
of
their
treatment
of
their
and
if
schuyler
did
treat
his
wife
handsomely
she
rid
of
him
now
at
any
rate
you
a
thing
bradbury
i
informed
him
and
i
am
going
to
do
all
i
can
for
that
young
widow
she
have
a
lot
of
unpleasant
publicity
at
best
and
if
i
can
shield
her
from
part
of
it
so
much
the
better
all
right
calhoun
do
what
you
like
but
do
get
in
on
the
detective
work
i
know
your
weakness
for
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
know
if
you
begin
you
never
let
up
bradbury
was
right
i
have
a
fondness
for
detective
work
not
the
police
part
of
it
but
the
inquiry
into
mystery
the
deduction
from
clues
and
the
sifting
of
evidence
i
had
no
mind
to
miss
the
inquest
and
i
had
a
burning
curiosity
to
know
what
had
become
of
vicky
van
this
was
not
only
curiosity
either
i
had
a
high
respect
and
a
genuine
liking
for
that
little
lady
and
as
reeves
had
put
it
i
was
only
too
willing
to
give
her
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
though
i
could
feel
any
real
doubt
that
she
had
killed
schuyler
as
bradbury
said
she
did
know
a
somers
but
she
may
have
known
the
millionaire
schuyler
i
had
never
seen
anything
of
a
seamy
side
to
vicky
character
but
then
i
did
know
her
so
very
well
and
the
man
was
dead
and
who
else
have
killed
him
i
went
around
to
the
caterer
on
my
way
uptown
that
afternoon
and
asked
him
as
to
the
reliability
of
luigi
and
the
probable
truth
of
his
story
that
man
fraschini
told
me
is
as
honest
as
the
day
i
had
him
longer
than
any
of
my
other
waiters
and
he
has
never
said
or
done
anything
to
make
me
doubt
his
accuracy
i
believe
calhoun
that
luigi
saw
exactly
what
he
said
he
saw
might
he
not
have
been
mistaken
in
the
identity
of
the
woman
not
likely
i
call
him
and
you
can
question
him
this
was
what
i
wanted
to
question
the
waiter
alone
and
i
welcomed
the
opportunity
i
know
it
was
miss
van
allen
was
the
quiet
response
of
the
italian
to
my
inquiry
i
can
not
be
mistaken
i
had
seen
her
many
times
during
the
evening
i
therefore
recognized
the
gown
she
wore
of
light
yellow
gauzy
stuff
and
an
of
long
gold
bead
fringes
i
saw
her
stand
above
the
fallen
body
looking
down
at
it
with
a
horrified
face
i
saw
stains
of
blood
on
her
gown
where
i
interrupted
what
part
of
her
gown
luigi
thought
a
moment
on
the
lower
flounces
as
if
her
skirts
had
brushed
against
the
the
victim
when
she
stooped
over
him
did
she
herself
observe
these
stains
yes
she
looked
at
them
and
looked
frightened
and
then
she
ran
to
the
hall
and
you
saw
no
other
person
near
none
and
heard
nobody
i
heard
only
the
voices
from
the
parlor
there
was
much
noise
of
laughter
and
talk
there
no
amount
of
questioning
could
change
or
add
to
luigi
story
it
was
quite
evident
that
he
was
telling
just
what
he
saw
and
had
no
interest
in
coloring
it
to
make
it
appear
different
in
any
way
he
admired
miss
van
allen
he
said
she
was
a
pleasant
lady
and
not
hard
to
please
if
her
orders
were
faithfully
carried
out
he
expressed
no
personal
interest
in
the
question
of
her
guilt
or
innocence
he
simply
told
what
he
had
seen
i
did
altogether
like
his
stolid
indifference
it
seemed
impossible
there
should
be
so
little
humanity
in
a
but
i
knew
he
was
a
good
and
conscientious
waiter
and
i
concluded
he
was
nothing
more
i
went
home
and
of
course
was
met
by
aunt
lucy
and
winnie
with
a
perfect
storm
of
questions
after
dinner
i
begged
let
me
get
a
little
rest
and
food
and
then
i
tell
you
all
i
know
but
after
a
few
spoonfuls
of
soup
winnie
declared
i
was
too
nervous
to
eat
and
i
might
as
well
talk
well
i
will
i
said
but
look
here
you
two
to
begin
with
i
want
you
to
understand
that
i
involved
in
this
matter
in
a
business
way
and
i
also
interested
in
a
personal
way
and
i
do
want
any
silly
talk
about
it
being
unfortunate
or
regrettable
that
i
should
be
it
a
business
case
aunt
lucy
as
far
as
the
settlement
of
schuyler
estate
is
concerned
and
it
a
personal
affair
that
acquainted
with
miss
van
allen
and
i
propose
to
make
more
or
less
effort
to
find
some
trace
of
that
girl
and
to
see
if
there
is
any
possible
chance
that
she
may
not
be
the
guilty
one
after
all
good
for
you
lord
chesterton
cried
winnie
i
always
knew
you
were
the
soul
of
chivalry
and
now
you
proving
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
find
out
things
i
mean
i
do
know
yet
win
but
if
you
want
to
help
me
you
can
do
a
lot
indeed
she
wo
declared
aunt
lucy
if
you
have
to
do
these
things
as
a
matter
of
business
i
ca
object
but
i
wo
have
winnie
dragged
into
it
no
dragging
aunt
lu
and
nothing
very
desperate
for
winnie
to
do
but
i
be
jolly
glad
if
both
of
you
would
just
glance
out
of
the
window
occasionally
and
see
if
you
see
anything
going
on
at
the
van
allen
house
that
all
oh
i
do
that
winnie
cried
nobody
can
see
me
i
keep
behind
our
curtains
and
i
can
see
that
house
perfectly
well
i
do
mean
all
the
time
child
but
i
do
feel
sure
that
vicky
van
will
come
back
there
and
if
you
glance
out
now
and
then
you
might
see
her
go
in
or
out
but
it
dark
said
aunt
lucy
who
was
becoming
interested
in
spite
of
her
scruples
i
do
mean
or
any
night
but
in
the
daytime
she
likely
to
come
if
at
all
in
broad
daylight
i
think
are
the
police
keeping
guard
on
the
house
inquired
my
aunt
only
the
regular
patrolman
he
passes
it
every
few
hours
joggles
the
doorknob
and
goes
on
if
vicky
is
as
clever
as
i
think
she
is
she
time
that
policeman
and
sneak
into
the
house
between
his
rounds
it
only
a
chance
you
know
but
you
might
see
her
and
then
i
told
them
all
i
knew
myself
of
the
whole
affair
and
seeing
that
i
was
deeply
into
the
turmoil
of
it
all
and
had
grave
responsibilities
aunt
lucy
withdrew
all
objections
and
sympathized
with
me
also
she
was
impressed
with
my
important
business
connections
with
the
schuyler
family
and
was
frankly
curious
about
that
aristocratic
household
i
was
asked
over
and
over
again
as
to
their
mode
of
living
the
furniture
and
appointments
of
the
house
and
the
attitudes
of
the
widow
and
the
sisters
toward
each
other
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before
i
remembered
some
important
papers
bradbury
had
given
me
to
hand
to
schuyler
and
as
soon
as
i
thought
of
them
i
telephoned
to
know
if
i
might
then
bring
them
over
yes
came
back
ruth
schuyler
soft
voice
i
wish
you
would
i
want
to
consult
you
about
some
other
things
also
the
interview
was
less
trying
than
that
of
the
morning
had
been
several
matters
of
inheritance
insurance
and
such
things
were
discussed
and
schuyler
was
more
composed
and
calm
she
looked
better
too
though
this
was
doubtless
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
she
wore
a
white
house
dress
which
was
far
more
becoming
than
black
to
her
colorless
face
and
light
hair
i
do
know
she
said
at
length
whether
what
i
want
to
say
should
be
said
to
you
or
to
the
detective
tell
me
first
i
said
and
i
may
be
able
to
advise
you
in
any
case
it
will
be
confidential
you
are
kind
she
said
and
her
grateful
eyes
smiled
appreciatively
it
this
i
rather
not
have
that
that
miss
van
allen
traced
if
it
can
be
prevented
in
any
way
i
have
a
special
reason
for
this
which
i
think
i
will
tell
you
it
is
that
on
thinking
it
over
i
have
become
convinced
that
my
husband
must
have
known
the
young
woman
and
the
acquaintance
was
not
to
his
credit
for
some
reason
i
think
she
must
have
forbidden
him
the
house
and
that
is
why
he
went
there
under
an
assumed
name
lowney
succeeded
in
getting
steele
on
the
long
distance
telephone
why
where
is
steele
in
chicago
lowney
says
that
he
had
to
go
there
on
the
midnight
train
and
that
is
why
he
left
the
lady
house
miss
van
house
so
suddenly
really
well
i
am
surprised
but
go
on
what
else
did
steele
say
he
said
that
schuyler
was
with
him
at
the
club
and
that
he
steele
said
he
was
going
to
miss
van
allen
party
and
schuyler
begged
him
to
take
him
along
and
introduce
him
as
somers
it
seems
he
had
asked
steele
before
to
do
this
but
this
time
he
was
more
insistent
so
steele
did
it
of
course
calhoun
i
asked
lowney
minutely
about
all
this
because
i
want
to
know
just
what
circumstances
led
up
to
my
husband
going
to
that
house
of
course
schuyler
you
have
every
right
to
know
and
did
steele
say
that
was
schuyler
first
visit
there
or
merely
his
first
visit
as
mr
somers
steele
thought
schuyler
had
never
been
to
the
house
before
at
all
but
may
he
not
have
been
mistaken
may
not
schuyler
have
known
the
lady
previously
oh
it
is
such
a
moil
but
in
any
case
calhoun
it
seems
to
me
that
further
probing
and
searching
will
only
pile
up
opprobrium
on
the
name
of
schuyler
and
i
ca
stand
it
i
am
so
unused
to
notoriety
or
publicity
i
ca
face
all
the
unpleasantness
that
must
follow
do
help
me
to
avoid
it
wo
you
i
certainly
will
if
i
can
but
i
fear
you
ask
the
impossible
schuyler
the
law
will
not
be
stopped
in
its
course
by
personal
inclinations
no
i
suppose
not
what
is
it
tibbetts
the
last
question
was
addressed
to
her
maid
who
appeared
at
the
doorway
the
woman
looked
at
her
mistress
with
a
mingled
air
of
deference
and
commiseration
the
telephone
she
said
i
said
you
were
busily
engaged
but
it
is
some
young
woman
who
begs
to
speak
to
you
a
moment
schuyler
excused
herself
and
left
the
room
and
tibbetts
smoothing
down
her
trim
white
apron
followed
another
secretary
my
hostess
said
as
she
returned
i
do
know
how
a
report
that
i
wanted
one
travelled
so
quickly
but
i
had
three
offered
since
noon
do
the
schuyler
ladies
still
object
no
at
least
they
are
willing
but
i
do
want
any
except
a
capable
one
not
so
much
experienced
as
and
intelligent
you
may
as
well
know
calhoun
since
you
are
to
look
after
my
affairs
that
my
late
husband
was
of
strictly
plain
habits
he
was
almost
frugal
in
his
ideas
of
how
little
womankind
should
be
indulged
in
any
luxuries
or
unnecessary
comforts
this
did
not
incommode
his
sisters
for
they
were
of
the
same
mind
but
i
desired
certain
things
which
he
saw
fit
to
deny
me
i
make
no
complaint
i
bear
his
memory
no
ill
will
but
i
feel
that
now
i
may
have
some
of
these
things
i
am
my
own
mistress
and
while
i
have
no
wish
to
cast
any
reflection
on
schuyler
management
of
his
own
house
yet
it
is
now
my
house
and
i
must
have
the
privilege
of
ordering
it
as
i
choose
it
had
come
already
then
ruth
schuyler
and
her
puritanical
had
met
the
issue
and
ruth
had
stood
up
for
her
rights
i
felt
that
i
knew
the
woman
well
enough
to
know
she
would
not
have
taken
this
stand
so
soon
after
her
husband
death
except
that
some
discussion
or
disagreement
had
made
it
necessary
for
her
to
assert
herself
i
bowed
in
acquiescence
and
said
i
am
sure
schuyler
there
can
be
no
objection
to
your
doing
exactly
as
you
please
this
house
is
entirely
your
own
half
schuyler
fortune
is
yours
and
you
are
responsible
to
nobody
for
your
actions
if
not
intrusive
i
will
offer
to
look
you
up
a
suitable
secretary
i
have
a
young
woman
in
mind
whom
i
think
you
would
like
i
am
not
easy
to
please
she
said
smiling
a
little
i
have
a
very
definite
idea
of
what
i
want
who
is
your
friend
not
a
friend
exactly
an
acquaintance
of
my
sister
who
is
eligible
for
the
post
if
she
suits
you
shall
i
send
her
round
to
see
you
yes
please
your
mention
of
her
is
enough
recommendation
i
want
calhoun
to
do
more
or
less
charitable
work
this
winter
that
was
another
of
schuyler
whims
to
attend
to
all
charities
himself
and
to
object
to
my
giving
anything
personally
as
i
shall
be
quiet
and
unoccupied
this
winter
i
plan
to
do
some
systematic
work
in
a
benevolent
way
i
know
this
sounds
strange
to
you
that
i
should
be
planning
these
things
so
soon
but
the
truth
is
i
do
plan
them
purposely
because
i
do
want
to
think
about
the
present
horror
i
need
something
to
keep
my
mind
from
thinking
of
the
awful
tragedy
or
i
shall
go
mad
it
seemed
to
me
not
wrong
to
think
about
some
work
that
should
benefit
others
and
to
do
this
will
give
me
an
outlet
for
my
energies
and
be
helpful
to
the
poor
and
suffering
ruth
schuyler
looked
almost
beautiful
as
her
face
glowed
with
enthusiasm
on
her
subject
i
realized
how
the
nervous
highstrung
woman
must
be
torn
with
agony
at
the
revelations
of
her
defects
and
the
uncertainty
of
his
honor
and
morality
and
all
in
addition
to
the
terrible
experiences
she
was
undergoing
and
must
yet
encounter
i
went
home
filled
with
a
desire
to
help
her
in
every
way
i
could
and
though
i
went
to
my
room
at
once
i
could
not
think
of
sleep
i
felt
like
planning
ways
to
put
the
police
off
the
track
or
finding
some
method
of
making
them
cease
their
hunt
for
vicky
van
i
went
down
to
the
library
and
sat
down
for
a
smoke
and
a
revery
and
i
sat
there
until
very
late
after
two
in
fact
without
getting
any
nearer
a
plan
than
i
was
at
the
start
it
was
nearly
three
when
i
concluded
that
i
could
sleep
at
last
i
stood
by
the
front
window
a
moment
looking
over
at
vicky
van
house
across
the
street
and
a
few
doors
from
our
own
as
i
looked
at
the
darkened
dwelling
i
saw
the
front
door
slowly
open
there
was
no
one
outside
it
was
being
opened
from
inside
as
i
knew
the
body
of
schuyler
had
been
taken
away
and
the
house
had
been
deserted
by
all
who
had
been
there
and
that
it
was
in
custody
of
the
police
i
looked
curiously
to
see
what
would
happen
next
out
of
the
door
came
a
slight
small
figure
it
was
i
felt
positive
vicky
van
herself
i
could
mistake
that
sleek
black
head
she
wore
no
hat
or
those
short
full
skirts
that
she
always
wore
she
looked
about
cautiously
and
then
with
swift
motions
she
unlocked
the
that
was
beside
her
front
door
took
out
several
letters
relocked
the
box
and
slipped
back
into
the
house
again
without
stopping
to
think
i
opened
my
front
door
and
flew
across
the
street
mounting
her
steps
i
rang
the
doorbell
hard
there
was
no
response
and
i
kept
on
ringing
a
veritable
bombardment
then
the
door
opened
a
very
little
bit
i
could
see
it
was
on
a
and
vicky
voice
said
please
go
away
no
i
wo
i
said
let
me
come
in
i
ca
let
you
come
in
go
away
and
then
the
door
closed
in
my
very
face
and
though
i
pleaded
vicky
let
me
in
there
was
no
response
chapter
ix
the
social
secretary
i
stood
staring
at
the
closed
door
what
did
it
mean
why
was
vicky
in
there
and
why
would
she
let
me
come
in
then
as
i
collected
my
wits
i
laughed
at
myself
i
knew
why
she
was
there
to
get
her
mail
doubtless
there
were
important
letters
that
she
must
have
and
she
had
dared
discovery
to
come
at
dead
of
night
to
get
them
the
patrolman
was
not
in
sight
she
had
looked
out
for
this
of
course
it
was
the
merest
chance
that
i
had
seen
her
otherwise
she
would
have
escaped
all
observation
at
three
in
the
morning
there
are
almost
no
people
abroad
in
the
quieter
streets
of
the
city
and
vicky
had
timed
her
visit
well
of
course
she
had
her
own
keys
and
i
felt
sure
she
had
stealthily
entered
at
the
basement
door
and
waited
her
time
to
secure
the
letters
from
the
i
looked
at
the
an
unusual
appendage
to
a
private
residence
but
vicky
was
away
from
home
so
much
it
was
doubtless
necessary
i
tried
to
look
in
at
a
window
but
all
shades
were
down
and
there
were
no
lights
inside
i
wanted
to
ring
the
doorbell
again
but
a
sense
of
delicacy
forbade
me
i
was
not
a
detective
and
if
i
persisted
i
might
attract
the
attention
of
a
or
of
the
returning
policeman
and
so
get
vicky
into
all
sorts
of
trouble
i
tracking
the
girl
down
if
she
was
a
criminal
let
the
police
find
her
i
had
no
desire
to
aid
their
efforts
but
i
did
want
to
see
vicky
van
i
wanted
to
offer
her
my
help
not
in
escaping
justice
exactly
but
i
wondered
if
i
might
do
some
little
errands
or
favors
that
would
show
my
friendliness
i
went
slowly
toward
home
when
i
had
an
inspiration
hastening
into
my
own
house
i
flew
to
the
telephone
and
called
vicky
number
which
i
knew
well
i
waited
some
time
for
a
response
but
at
last
i
heard
vicky
voice
say
who
is
it
please
an
impulse
of
protection
for
her
not
for
myself
led
me
to
withhold
my
name
nor
did
i
speak
hers
i
said
this
is
the
man
who
just
left
your
house
i
called
up
to
offer
help
if
i
can
render
you
any
that
good
of
you
she
returned
in
a
heartfelt
way
i
appreciate
such
kindness
but
you
can
do
nothing
nothing
thank
you
at
least
talk
to
me
a
few
minutes
i
so
anxious
about
you
you
are
not
implicated
in
the
in
the
matter
are
you
do
ask
me
she
murmured
in
such
a
serious
voice
that
my
heart
sank
what
i
did
or
did
do
must
always
remain
a
mystery
i
can
not
tell
you
anything
do
ask
and
if
you
would
help
me
try
your
best
to
have
inquiries
stopped
can
you
do
this
i
fear
not
but
ca
i
see
you
somewhere
and
we
can
talk
plainly
do
you
want
to
indeed
i
do
then
you
do
believe
in
me
do
you
hold
me
blameless
i
hesitated
at
this
i
could
lie
to
her
nor
could
i
rid
my
mind
of
the
conviction
of
her
guilt
i
said
i
will
if
you
assure
me
that
is
the
truth
i
i
ca
do
that
wait
a
minute
did
you
know
the
expected
guest
was
coming
under
an
assumed
name
i
did
not
did
you
know
any
somers
no
did
you
know
the
real
man
i
had
met
him
once
at
a
dance
did
you
like
him
i
neither
liked
nor
disliked
he
was
an
object
of
utter
indifference
to
me
then
why
did
you
hush
you
can
never
know
i
ca
tell
you
then
do
please
believe
i
want
to
befriend
you
the
agony
and
fear
in
vicky
voice
thrilled
me
and
i
desired
only
to
shield
and
protect
her
she
was
so
young
and
alone
it
is
good
to
have
a
friendly
voice
speak
to
me
but
you
can
only
forget
me
no
let
me
do
something
definite
some
errand
of
trust
some
matter
of
confidence
do
you
mean
it
will
you
gladly
what
is
it
then
if
you
will
collect
my
mail
from
the
box
at
the
door
after
a
few
days
say
three
days
and
put
it
aside
for
me
you
saw
me
get
it
i
suppose
and
it
is
a
dangerous
thing
for
me
to
do
where
are
you
i
mean
where
are
you
staying
do
ask
i
am
safe
i
see
the
newspapers
and
i
know
i
am
to
be
hunted
down
so
i
must
hide
i
can
not
face
the
inquiries
i
fear
arrest
and
and
punishment
her
tones
betrayed
guilty
fear
and
i
shuddered
at
the
confirmation
of
my
suspicions
but
i
would
do
what
i
could
for
her
how
shall
i
get
your
letters
i
asked
and
i
honestly
tried
not
to
disclose
my
sudden
knowledge
of
her
guilt
but
her
quick
ears
caught
my
changed
inflection
you
believe
me
guilty
she
said
and
she
stifled
a
sob
yet
still
you
will
help
me
god
bless
you
listen
then
for
i
must
stop
this
talking
it
is
too
desperately
dangerous
i
will
leave
the
key
of
the
mail
box
no
i
will
send
it
to
you
by
mail
that
will
be
the
safest
then
will
you
get
the
letters
and
put
them
where
shall
i
say
i
mail
them
to
you
no
that
would
never
do
you
can
get
into
this
house
ca
you
the
police
will
let
you
in
at
any
time
yes
i
can
probably
manage
that
then
bring
them
with
you
all
of
the
three
days
mail
at
once
you
understand
and
put
them
in
that
great
chinese
jar
in
the
music
room
the
one
with
the
gold
dragon
on
the
cover
no
one
will
look
there
for
them
i
will
manage
to
come
and
get
them
very
soon
please
do
spy
on
me
will
you
chester
the
use
of
my
first
name
was
i
knew
inadvertent
and
unconscious
it
thrilled
me
there
was
a
marvellous
fascination
always
about
vicky
van
and
now
at
the
end
of
this
my
mysterious
night
telephone
conversation
i
felt
its
thrill
and
i
agreed
to
her
plea
no
dear
i
said
and
not
till
afterward
did
i
realize
the
term
i
had
used
i
will
not
spy
but
promise
me
that
you
will
call
on
me
for
any
help
you
may
need
and
tell
me
are
you
alone
or
is
julie
with
you
julie
is
with
me
she
returned
she
helps
protect
me
and
with
your
friendship
too
i
am
blessed
indeed
but
this
is
i
shall
leave
new
york
in
a
few
days
never
to
return
i
must
have
that
mail
or
i
would
go
at
once
if
you
will
help
me
get
that
you
will
do
all
there
is
left
for
any
one
to
do
for
me
in
the
world
her
tone
frightened
me
vicky
i
cried
forgetting
all
caution
do
my
dear
do
but
i
could
not
put
in
words
the
fear
that
had
suddenly
come
to
me
and
even
as
i
stammered
for
speech
the
click
came
that
told
me
she
had
hung
up
the
receiver
i
cursed
myself
for
my
stupidity
in
speaking
her
name
such
a
blunder
why
it
might
have
been
overheard
by
anybody
on
the
line
no
wonder
she
left
me
doubtless
i
had
driven
her
from
her
house
i
flew
to
the
window
then
i
remembered
i
had
promised
not
to
spy
and
i
turned
quickly
away
if
she
were
about
to
disappear
silently
and
stealthily
from
that
house
i
must
not
know
it
i
went
to
my
room
but
not
to
sleep
clearly
i
was
not
to
know
untroubled
slumber
again
very
soon
i
sat
up
and
thought
it
all
over
how
strange
that
i
should
have
spied
on
her
just
at
the
moment
she
was
secretly
getting
her
letters
but
i
realized
i
had
looked
at
the
house
so
often
it
would
be
stranger
still
if
i
had
missed
her
and
she
was
to
send
me
her
box
key
and
i
was
to
secrete
her
letters
for
her
important
indeed
those
letters
must
be
that
she
should
go
to
such
lengths
to
get
them
well
i
had
constituted
myself
her
knight
errant
in
that
particular
and
i
would
fulfil
the
trust
beneath
the
thrilling
excitement
of
the
night
occurrence
i
felt
a
dull
sad
foreboding
all
vicky
had
said
or
done
pointed
to
guilt
had
she
been
innocent
she
would
have
told
me
so
by
word
or
by
implication
she
would
have
given
me
a
tacit
assurance
of
her
guiltlessness
or
would
have
cried
out
at
the
injustice
of
suspicion
but
none
of
these
things
entered
into
her
talk
or
even
into
her
voice
or
intonations
she
had
sounded
sad
hopeless
despairing
and
her
last
words
made
me
fear
she
contemplated
taking
her
own
life
poor
little
vicky
van
vicky
what
was
the
mystery
back
of
it
all
what
could
it
be
well
at
least
i
would
scrupulously
perform
the
task
she
had
set
me
and
i
would
do
it
well
i
knew
i
could
manage
to
get
into
the
house
by
making
up
some
story
for
the
police
but
i
must
wait
for
the
promised
key
with
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
the
mailed
parcel
containing
the
key
might
give
me
a
clue
to
vicky
whereabouts
i
at
last
went
to
sleep
next
morning
at
breakfast
i
said
nothing
of
my
night
experiences
i
told
winnie
however
that
she
need
watch
the
van
allen
house
as
i
had
heard
that
vicky
had
left
it
permanently
however
could
you
hear
that
exclaimed
my
wideawake
sister
have
you
had
a
wireless
from
the
fugitive
something
of
the
sort
i
said
smilingly
and
now
listen
here
win
how
do
you
think
that
friend
of
yours
miss
crowell
would
like
to
be
a
social
secretary
for
mrs
schuyler
she
love
it
cried
winnie
does
schuyler
want
one
yes
and
she
wants
her
mighty
quick
from
what
you
said
of
the
crowell
girl
i
should
think
she
be
just
the
one
can
you
get
her
on
the
telephone
yes
but
not
so
early
as
this
i
call
her
about
ten
all
right
you
fix
it
up
i
expect
schuyler
will
pay
proper
salary
to
the
right
secretary
of
course
miss
crowell
is
experienced
oh
yes
assured
win
and
i
sure
she
love
to
go
why
any
secretary
would
be
glad
to
go
there
not
just
now
i
should
think
observed
aunt
lucy
the
amount
of
work
there
must
be
something
fearful
it
will
be
heavy
for
a
time
i
agreed
but
it
is
only
for
schuyler
personal
correspondence
and
business
i
mean
the
other
two
ladies
would
not
expect
to
use
her
services
all
right
said
winnie
i
fix
it
up
with
edith
crowell
and
if
she
ca
go
i
ask
her
to
recommend
somebody
shall
i
send
her
there
yes
as
soon
as
she
will
go
and
let
me
know
telephone
the
office
about
noon
yep
winnie
promised
and
i
went
away
my
head
in
a
whirl
with
the
various
and
sundry
matters
i
had
to
attend
to
i
do
think
i
thought
of
the
secretary
matter
again
until
at
noon
winnie
telephoned
me
that
it
was
all
right
i
thanked
her
and
promptly
forgot
the
episode
and
so
it
was
that
when
i
reached
home
that
night
i
had
one
of
the
surprises
of
my
life
winnie
came
to
dinner
smiling
and
rather
what
up
infant
i
asked
have
you
accepted
a
proposal
from
a
nice
college
lad
huh
and
win
head
tossed
i
guess
you
open
your
eyes
when
i
tell
you
what
i
have
accepted
tell
it
out
angel
child
relieve
your
own
impatience
well
if
you
please
i
have
accepted
the
post
of
social
secretary
to
randolph
schuyler
winifred
elizabeth
calhoun
you
have
i
thought
i
arouse
some
slight
interest
she
said
and
she
calmly
went
on
with
her
dinner
i
looked
at
aunt
lucy
who
sat
with
a
resigned
expression
toying
with
her
unused
what
does
she
mean
i
asked
she
has
done
just
what
she
says
replied
aunt
lucy
but
only
for
a
few
days
miss
crowell
let
me
tell
interrupted
winnie
it
my
party
you
see
chet
edith
crowell
is
wild
to
have
the
place
and
is
going
to
take
it
but
she
ca
go
until
the
first
of
next
week
and
she
does
want
to
lose
the
chance
so
i
went
over
and
told
schuyler
about
it
and
then
as
she
was
simply
swamped
with
letters
and
telegrams
and
telephones
and
callers
and
goodness
knows
what
all
i
offered
to
help
her
out
till
edith
can
get
there
and
she
was
so
grateful
oh
i
think
she
is
a
darling
i
never
saw
anyone
i
liked
and
admired
so
much
at
first
sight
she
is
charming
i
conceded
but
what
a
crazy
scheme
win
how
did
you
persuade
aunt
lucy
to
agree
i
managed
her
and
winnie
bobbed
her
wise
young
head
cannily
it
came
to
me
in
a
moment
though
not
exactly
a
tuft
hunter
aunt
lucy
was
deeply
impressed
by
real
grandeur
and
elegance
and
it
came
to
me
at
once
that
winnie
tales
of
the
great
house
and
the
aristocratic
people
had
a
strong
influence
on
our
aunt
views
and
had
brought
about
her
permission
for
win
to
go
there
for
a
few
days
and
it
was
no
harm
it
was
as
if
winnie
were
a
regular
secretary
but
just
to
hold
the
place
for
miss
crowell
was
simply
a
kindly
deed
and
so
after
dinner
i
settled
myself
in
our
cosy
library
for
a
comfortable
smoke
and
bade
winnie
tell
me
every
single
thing
that
had
happened
through
the
day
oh
it
was
thrilling
winnie
exclaimed
part
of
the
time
i
was
at
the
desk
in
the
library
and
part
of
the
time
upstairs
in
schuyler
very
own
room
she
was
so
kind
to
me
but
she
is
nearly
distracted
and
i
do
wonder
the
undertakers
men
were
in
and
out
and
those
two
old
maids
his
sisters
you
know
were
everlastingly
appearing
and
disappearing
and
they
do
like
schuyler
an
awful
lot
nor
she
them
oh
they
polite
and
all
that
but
you
can
see
they
of
totally
different
types
i
like
schuyler
heaps
better
but
still
there
something
about
the
old
girls
that
the
real
thing
they
schuylers
and
also
they
and
farther
back
i
believe
they
cabots
or
something
and
schuyler
what
is
she
i
asked
as
win
paused
for
breath
i
do
know
nothing
particular
i
guess
oh
yes
i
learned
her
name
was
ellison
before
she
was
married
but
the
sisters
do
consult
her
about
family
matters
at
all
they
do
about
clothes
though
and
she
knows
a
lot
why
chess
she
having
the
loveliest
things
made
if
they
mourning
and
the
sisters
they
ask
her
about
everything
they
order
to
wear
i
mean
and
just
think
schuyler
never
wears
any
jewels
but
pearls
it
a
whim
you
know
or
it
was
her
husband
whim
or
something
but
anyway
she
has
oceans
of
pearls
and
no
other
gems
at
all
did
she
tell
you
so
yes
but
it
came
in
the
conversation
you
know
she
is
no
boaster
no
she
the
modestest
gentlest
sweetest
little
lady
i
ever
saw
i
just
love
her
well
i
answered
a
lot
of
letters
for
her
and
she
liked
the
way
i
did
it
and
she
liked
me
i
guess
for
she
said
she
only
hoped
miss
crowell
would
suit
her
as
well
she
knows
you
my
sister
of
course
but
that
is
why
she
likes
me
old
bunch
of
conceit
though
i
must
admit
she
likes
you
chet
she
said
you
were
not
only
kind
but
you
have
a
fair
amount
of
intelligence
no
she
did
use
those
words
exactly
but
i
gathered
that
was
what
she
meant
the
funeral
is
to
be
tomorrow
evening
you
know
i
had
to
write
and
telephone
quite
a
good
deal
about
that
though
the
sisters
tended
to
it
mostly
was
there
much
said
about
about
the
actual
case
winnie
you
mean
about
the
murder
win
clear
eyes
did
blink
at
the
word
no
not
much
in
my
hearing
but
schuyler
was
in
the
room
all
the
time
and
i
know
lowney
is
he
the
detective
was
there
once
and
i
think
twice
did
you
see
anyone
else
only
some
of
the
servants
schuyler
own
maid
her
name
is
tibbetts
is
the
sort
you
read
about
in
english
novels
a
nice
motherly
woman
with
gray
hair
and
a
black
silk
apron
i
liked
her
but
the
maid
who
looks
after
the
old
sisters
i
did
like
so
well
never
mind
the
maids
tell
me
more
about
schuyler
does
she
think
vicky
van
killed
schuyler
since
you
in
this
thing
so
deep
win
there
no
use
mincing
matters
i
should
say
not
yes
of
course
she
thinks
the
vicky
person
did
the
killing
how
could
she
think
anything
else
and
the
two
sisters
are
madly
revengeful
as
soon
as
the
funeral
is
over
they
going
to
work
to
find
that
girl
and
bring
her
to
justice
they
say
the
inquest
will
help
a
lot
when
will
that
be
chess
can
i
go
to
it
no
of
course
not
winnie
this
from
aunt
lucy
it
one
thing
for
you
to
help
schuyler
out
in
an
emergency
but
you
not
to
get
mixed
up
in
a
murder
trial
an
inquest
is
a
trial
auntie
and
win
looked
like
a
wise
owl
as
she
aired
her
new
and
suddenly
acquired
knowledge
ca
i
go
chess
we
see
infant
perhaps
if
schuyler
needs
your
services
she
may
want
you
there
with
her
oh
in
that
case
began
aunt
lucy
but
winnie
was
off
again
on
one
of
her
enthusiastic
descriptions
of
the
grand
ways
of
the
schuyler
household
and
aunt
lucy
was
quite
willing
to
listen
as
for
me
i
wanted
the
benefit
of
every
possible
sidelight
on
the
whole
business
and
i
too
took
in
all
winnie
detailed
narrations
chapter
x
the
inquest
the
inquest
was
in
progress
in
the
coroner
courtroom
inquiry
was
being
made
in
an
endeavor
to
discover
who
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
randolph
schuyler
the
funeral
of
the
millionaire
had
taken
place
and
the
will
had
been
read
and
now
the
public
awaited
news
of
the
action
of
the
police
in
placing
the
crime
and
producing
the
criminal
the
case
had
become
a
celebrated
one
not
only
because
of
the
prominence
of
the
victim
but
because
of
the
mystery
surrounding
the
young
woman
suspected
of
the
deed
of
murder
many
voluntary
witnesses
had
come
forward
with
additional
information
regarding
victoria
van
allen
but
none
of
these
knew
anything
more
of
her
relatives
or
progenitors
than
i
did
myself
some
of
these
were
asked
to
testify
at
the
inquest
but
more
were
not
so
called
on
as
their
testimony
was
in
no
way
material
or
vital
i
did
not
propose
to
attend
all
the
sessions
myself
but
i
wanted
to
hear
the
opening
queries
and
learn
just
how
the
case
was
to
be
managed
doctor
remson
told
of
his
examination
of
schuyler
body
and
testified
that
death
was
practically
instantaneous
as
a
result
of
a
single
stab
of
the
short
sharp
knife
the
knife
was
produced
and
identified
it
had
been
carefully
taken
care
of
and
had
been
photographed
to
preserve
the
faint
fingermarks
which
were
on
its
handle
and
which
might
or
might
not
be
the
prints
of
the
fingers
the
caterer
fraschini
told
of
his
orders
for
the
party
supper
and
of
the
sending
of
his
best
and
most
faithful
waiters
to
attend
to
the
feast
luigi
the
head
waiter
again
went
over
his
story
i
had
heard
this
twice
before
but
i
listened
with
deep
interest
and
i
realized
that
granting
the
truth
of
his
recital
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
of
vicky
van
guilt
i
had
of
course
told
of
seeing
her
take
her
mail
from
the
box
that
night
nor
of
her
talking
to
me
over
the
telephone
should
absolute
law
and
justice
call
for
that
information
i
might
give
it
up
but
at
present
i
was
awaiting
developments
vicky
had
sent
me
her
mailbox
key
and
i
had
received
it
duly
by
mail
it
was
not
sent
by
parcel
post
nor
was
it
registered
these
would
have
called
for
the
sender
address
but
sent
by
ordinary
letter
post
the
flat
little
key
came
duly
and
promptly
i
had
not
used
it
yet
the
time
was
not
ripe
until
that
same
night
and
i
intended
to
say
nothing
of
it
until
i
had
fulfilled
my
promise
if
indeed
i
ever
told
of
it
but
luigi
story
as
i
heard
it
again
made
me
shiver
with
apprehension
surely
since
he
saw
vicky
right
there
at
the
moment
bending
over
the
victim
blood
stains
on
her
gown
there
could
be
no
loophole
of
innocence
had
the
murderer
been
some
one
else
and
had
vicky
known
it
she
must
have
made
an
outcry
must
have
accused
the
guilty
party
there
was
no
one
whom
vicky
loved
well
enough
to
wish
to
shield
and
too
the
guests
were
all
in
the
big
there
was
no
one
unaccounted
for
if
luigi
himself
or
any
of
the
men
had
by
chance
done
the
deed
vicky
would
have
run
away
there
was
no
sense
in
that
so
i
could
see
no
possible
theory
but
that
of
vicky
actual
guilt
why
she
did
it
was
another
story
she
may
have
known
schuyler
before
might
have
known
him
a
long
time
might
have
had
her
own
reasons
for
wishing
him
dead
but
all
that
was
outside
the
issue
of
her
criminality
there
was
no
eyewitness
of
the
stabbing
itself
but
luigi
presence
on
the
scene
an
instant
later
left
no
room
for
question
as
to
the
hand
that
had
held
the
knife
the
jury
seemed
to
think
this
gravely
the
men
listened
to
what
the
italian
told
and
their
faces
showed
what
they
believed
then
came
the
guests
of
the
party
one
after
another
they
told
the
same
story
all
knew
vicky
fairly
well
as
a
pleasant
acquaintance
all
liked
her
as
a
good
friend
all
enjoyed
her
as
a
delightful
hostess
and
many
told
individual
instances
of
vicky
kind
heart
and
helping
hand
not
infrequently
had
she
lent
assistance
both
financial
and
in
other
ways
to
these
friends
of
hers
never
they
all
said
had
they
known
her
to
do
a
mean
or
deceitful
act
or
to
say
an
unkind
or
malicious
word
the
men
spoke
of
her
as
a
gay
butterfly
girl
who
was
a
coquette
but
who
stopped
short
of
a
real
flirtation
the
women
gave
her
such
commendation
as
is
rarely
given
them
to
their
own
sex
and
declared
that
miss
van
allen
was
a
simple
kindly
generous
nature
without
a
trace
of
the
disposition
which
causes
a
woman
to
be
dubbed
a
norman
steele
was
present
he
explained
his
sudden
departure
from
the
party
by
the
fact
that
he
had
to
catch
an
owl
train
for
chicago
he
said
further
that
randolph
schuyler
had
asked
him
to
take
him
around
to
vicky
van
as
he
wanted
to
meet
her
but
he
had
asked
steele
especially
to
introduce
him
as
somers
he
had
given
no
reason
for
this
and
steele
had
thought
little
of
it
randolph
schuyler
was
a
man
whom
his
friends
obeyed
often
without
question
i
understood
this
steele
was
no
more
of
a
toady
to
the
millionaire
than
most
men
would
be
but
a
request
of
randolph
schuyler
was
not
to
be
thoughtlessly
refused
so
steele
acquiesced
he
was
reticent
in
further
dilating
on
schuyler
character
said
he
often
called
on
ladies
who
could
not
be
called
exclusive
but
denied
knowledge
of
definite
cases
or
names
on
the
whole
steele
evidence
did
get
us
anywhere
we
already
knew
that
schuyler
had
gone
to
vicky
van
under
an
assumed
name
the
reason
for
this
had
little
if
anything
to
do
with
what
had
followed
a
connection
of
some
sort
between
vicky
and
schuyler
must
be
traced
in
order
to
arrive
at
her
possible
motive
a
woman
does
not
stab
to
kill
a
chance
guest
whom
she
has
never
met
before
bert
garrison
came
next
his
talk
ran
mostly
to
eulogies
of
vicky
the
poor
fellow
was
dead
in
love
with
her
and
had
been
for
many
moons
but
though
vicky
favored
him
more
than
some
others
yet
she
gave
him
no
definite
encouragement
as
he
himself
ruefully
admitted
but
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
show
that
a
girl
of
victoria
van
high
character
and
fine
qualities
would
be
incapable
of
a
base
deed
the
coroner
smiled
a
little
at
garrison
vehemence
and
let
him
run
on
for
a
time
in
praise
of
the
absent
vicky
at
last
he
said
and
why
then
garrison
in
your
opinion
has
miss
van
allen
disappeared
the
disappearance
is
not
of
her
own
volition
declared
garrison
she
has
been
taken
away
by
somebody
and
held
against
her
will
in
order
to
make
her
appear
guilty
this
was
a
new
theory
i
might
have
given
it
serious
consideration
had
i
not
had
speech
with
the
girl
herself
it
could
be
that
vicky
was
held
captive
since
she
was
at
her
own
house
two
nights
after
the
crime
but
i
could
see
that
the
jury
and
even
the
coroner
and
detectives
were
interested
in
this
idea
by
whom
could
she
possibly
or
theoretically
he
thus
held
the
coroner
asked
i
do
know
but
assuming
some
intruder
effected
an
entrance
and
stabbed
schuyler
if
surprised
during
or
after
the
act
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
miss
van
allen
in
the
dining
room
he
might
in
some
way
have
gotten
her
out
of
the
house
and
still
be
keeping
her
in
a
it
was
perhaps
a
possibility
but
i
did
see
how
any
intruder
could
do
all
that
without
being
seen
by
the
waiters
unless
perchance
the
waiters
had
been
bribed
to
silence
and
that
in
the
face
of
earnest
and
convincing
testimony
i
could
not
believe
it
was
a
fantastic
theory
evolved
in
the
brain
of
garrison
for
the
purpose
of
diverting
suspicion
from
vicky
van
however
it
seemed
to
impress
the
coroner
and
he
made
notes
as
he
dismissed
the
witness
cassie
weldon
added
one
bit
of
new
information
she
said
though
with
evident
reluctance
that
she
had
caught
a
mere
glimpse
of
somebody
running
upstairs
just
before
the
waiter
had
come
to
call
for
help
cassie
had
not
wanted
to
testify
at
all
as
she
had
intimated
to
me
it
was
detrimental
to
her
work
as
a
concert
singer
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
affair
but
since
she
had
to
give
her
testimony
she
apparently
felt
it
her
duty
to
tell
the
whole
truth
how
could
you
see
the
stairs
from
the
asked
the
interested
coroner
i
was
near
the
door
and
though
i
was
not
looking
out
into
the
hall
i
had
a
vague
fleeting
impression
of
somebody
running
upstairs
i
paid
no
attention
to
it
of
course
but
i
am
sure
somebody
did
a
man
or
a
woman
a
woman
that
is
i
was
conscious
of
a
flutter
of
skirts
but
i
am
not
sure
it
was
miss
van
allen
i
did
see
her
clearly
enough
even
to
notice
the
color
of
her
gown
it
was
merely
a
glimpse
of
some
one
flying
round
the
newel
post
and
up
the
stairs
it
might
have
been
a
stranger
you
mean
if
there
were
some
intruder
it
may
have
been
a
woman
and
not
a
man
i
do
know
i
tell
you
i
can
only
say
i
know
somebody
ran
upstairs
further
than
that
i
no
idea
concerning
it
it
must
have
been
miss
van
allen
said
the
coroner
decidedly
had
it
been
any
other
woman
and
had
she
stabbed
schuyler
miss
van
allen
would
not
have
disappeared
now
if
this
woman
who
ran
upstairs
was
miss
van
allen
she
effected
an
escape
from
the
upper
stories
is
there
a
skylight
exit
no
one
seemed
to
know
as
no
one
had
thought
of
vicky
van
leaving
her
house
by
such
means
but
to
me
the
idea
was
ridiculous
a
girl
in
elaborate
evening
gown
clambering
out
of
a
skylight
to
where
not
to
a
neighbor
for
vicky
van
knew
none
of
the
nearby
residents
i
had
heard
her
say
so
myself
and
had
she
descended
into
a
strange
household
and
begged
for
shelter
it
would
have
become
known
before
this
well
anyway
the
detective
lowney
immediately
sent
an
order
to
have
the
skylight
matter
looked
into
and
the
proceedings
went
on
ariadne
gale
was
closely
questioned
as
to
how
she
knew
of
the
picture
in
the
back
of
randolph
schuyler
watch
but
she
declared
that
he
had
shown
it
to
her
during
their
conversation
that
evening
i
never
saw
the
man
before
said
ariadne
who
unlike
cassie
weldon
rather
enjoyed
the
publicity
of
the
occasion
i
chanced
to
be
about
the
first
girl
he
was
introduced
to
when
he
came
into
the
house
and
we
had
a
chat
and
when
i
chaffed
him
a
bit
on
his
dignity
and
presence
he
refuted
it
by
showing
me
the
picture
in
his
watch
he
said
it
was
a
little
chorus
girl
he
had
taken
out
to
supper
the
night
before
i
could
see
the
picture
had
been
merely
tucked
in
temporarily
it
was
neatly
pasted
in
as
a
picture
usually
is
and
then
i
chaffed
him
on
his
fickleness
our
conversation
was
the
merest
foolery
and
a
moment
after
he
went
over
to
be
presented
to
miss
van
allen
you
think
they
had
never
met
before
i
sure
they
had
not
they
looked
at
each
other
with
the
conventional
politeness
of
strangers
i
know
miss
van
allen
well
and
she
is
not
one
to
dissemble
or
pretend
i
am
sure
she
had
never
laid
eyes
on
that
man
before
she
simply
have
killed
him
ariadne
further
evidence
amounted
to
nothing
nor
did
that
of
several
other
of
the
party
guests
who
were
called
on
except
reeves
she
knew
more
of
vicky
home
life
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
but
even
she
knew
nothing
of
the
girl
origin
she
had
first
met
her
at
one
of
miss
gale
studio
parties
and
had
taken
a
fancy
to
her
at
once
where
did
first
meet
her
miss
gale
the
coroner
interrupted
to
ask
she
came
to
my
studio
to
look
at
my
pictures
was
the
reply
she
admired
them
and
bought
one
she
was
so
pleasant
and
so
interested
in
my
work
that
she
came
two
or
three
times
and
then
i
invited
her
to
one
of
my
little
studio
affairs
she
quickly
made
friends
and
she
invited
us
to
her
house
i
went
there
first
about
two
years
ago
so
did
i
reeves
resumed
and
since
then
i
have
been
there
frequently
and
every
time
i
saw
the
girl
i
liked
her
better
but
she
was
always
a
bit
of
a
mystery
i
confess
i
tried
at
times
to
learn
something
of
her
previous
life
but
she
adroitly
evaded
my
questions
and
cleverly
changed
the
subject
i
think
however
from
chance
hints
she
let
drop
that
her
home
was
somewhere
in
the
middle
west
an
indefinite
term
observed
coroner
fenn
it
all
i
know
where
did
miss
van
allen
go
on
her
frequent
absences
from
her
home
that
i
do
know
either
often
she
be
away
a
week
and
on
her
return
would
tell
of
a
gay
house
party
down
on
long
island
or
a
trip
up
westchester
way
but
i
do
remember
any
definite
place
she
visited
i
do
piped
up
ariadne
she
often
goes
to
greenwich
connecticut
and
to
bronxville
i
heard
her
tell
of
these
trips
she
has
a
wide
circle
of
acquaintances
and
of
course
she
a
favorite
with
all
who
know
her
i
have
a
piece
of
evidence
resumed
reeves
which
i
daresay
i
ought
to
exhibit
it
is
a
letter
from
miss
van
allen
which
i
received
only
this
morning
this
caused
a
sensation
a
letter
from
vicky
van
just
received
i
found
myself
trembling
in
my
shoes
and
i
asked
myself
why
was
i
afraid
the
girl
would
be
caught
did
i
want
to
shield
a
felon
and
i
had
to
admit
to
myself
that
i
did
i
was
in
love
with
vicky
van
but
i
had
a
tremendous
interest
in
her
and
i
did
want
that
little
lone
helpless
person
haled
before
a
court
of
justice
vicky
did
seem
terribly
alone
hosts
of
friends
she
had
but
no
one
who
was
in
any
way
responsible
for
her
or
in
a
position
to
help
her
well
if
she
ever
returned
voluntarily
or
perforce
she
would
find
a
friend
and
champion
in
one
chester
calhoun
of
that
i
was
certain
reeves
handed
her
letter
over
to
the
coroner
and
he
read
it
out
it
ran
my
dear
reeves
you
have
always
been
such
a
good
friend
to
me
that
i
writing
you
just
a
line
you
are
everything
that
is
good
and
kind
and
now
going
to
ask
you
as
a
final
favor
to
forget
vicky
van
at
once
and
forever
i
am
going
away
and
i
shall
never
return
do
think
of
me
any
more
hardly
than
you
must
but
if
you
can
keep
any
loving
little
memory
of
the
hours
we
spent
together
i
want
you
to
do
so
and
as
a
remembrance
i
want
you
to
have
my
little
electric
coupe
it
is
in
rennard
garage
and
i
have
written
him
to
turn
it
over
to
you
i
shall
miss
our
happy
times
together
but
i
can
never
come
back
do
not
worry
about
me
i
am
safe
and
i
am
your
affectionate
vicky
van
you
are
sure
this
is
from
miss
van
allen
asked
fenn
oh
yes
replied
reeves
there
no
mistaking
that
writing
nor
was
there
i
knew
vicky
penmanship
and
it
was
most
peculiar
never
have
i
seen
such
a
hand
angular
slightly
backhanded
and
full
of
character
it
would
be
difficult
to
imitate
it
and
too
no
one
would
have
any
reason
to
forge
that
letter
to
reeves
she
had
verified
vicky
statement
and
found
that
a
letter
to
the
garage
owner
had
instructed
him
to
give
up
the
car
to
reeves
and
he
had
already
done
so
that
very
morning
the
letters
had
both
been
mailed
in
new
york
the
night
before
the
postmark
showing
that
they
were
mailed
in
the
district
that
included
vicky
residence
was
she
then
even
now
in
hiding
near
her
home
or
had
she
sent
the
letters
to
be
mailed
by
some
one
else
by
julie
perhaps
who
i
felt
sure
was
with
her
mistress
wherever
that
might
be
my
leaping
thoughts
took
in
all
this
and
by
degrees
the
slower
going
coroner
put
it
in
words
lowney
the
detective
bristled
with
interest
a
clue
he
had
he
thought
but
what
a
clue
two
letters
posted
in
the
city
what
did
they
show
of
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
girl
lowney
scrutinized
the
one
to
reeves
ordinary
paper
such
as
might
be
bought
in
any
stationery
or
department
store
no
monogram
or
initial
on
it
nor
was
there
any
maker
name
under
the
flap
but
a
dozen
people
present
testified
to
vicky
handwriting
and
the
coroner
eagerly
took
possession
of
the
letter
sherlock
holmes
i
thought
to
myself
would
read
that
letter
look
at
it
through
his
good
old
lens
smell
it
and
then
walk
out
and
return
in
a
half
hour
with
vicky
van
in
tow
but
for
my
part
i
could
see
nothing
illuminating
in
that
plain
paper
and
envelope
and
the
letter
in
the
penmanship
all
i
gathered
was
that
wherever
vicky
was
she
was
not
only
safe
but
comfortable
the
tenor
of
the
note
breathed
leisure
and
composure
clearly
she
was
not
breathlessly
hurrying
from
one
place
to
another
or
vigilantly
eluding
pursuit
she
was
at
ease
with
opportunity
to
indulge
in
thoughtful
kindness
to
a
friend
and
to
write
at
length
about
herself
at
length
yes
but
with
no
hint
of
her
nor
any
clue
to
it
poor
little
vicky
she
seemed
so
alone
and
yet
how
did
i
know
she
may
have
gone
to
friends
or
somehow
i
hated
to
think
that
she
had
any
man
who
was
her
legal
or
even
willing
protector
yet
she
said
she
was
safe
and
her
letter
showed
no
fear
of
the
future
and
then
again
i
was
stabbed
by
the
thought
that
perhaps
there
was
no
earthly
future
for
vicky
van
i
did
want
her
to
kill
herself
i
did
want
her
to
be
found
and
arrested
what
did
i
want
i
was
sure
in
my
own
mind
save
that
i
wanted
her
safety
above
all
else
i
suppose
i
believed
her
guilty
i
could
believe
nothing
else
but
even
so
i
did
want
her
brought
to
bay
i
gave
my
own
testimony
which
was
all
true
and
all
frank
except
that
i
said
nothing
of
my
nocturnal
visit
to
vicky
house
or
of
our
telephone
conversation
if
my
conscience
smote
me
i
combated
it
with
my
chivalry
which
would
not
allow
me
to
betray
a
woman
into
the
hands
of
the
law
the
later
witnesses
who
were
mostly
the
working
people
whom
vicky
employed
by
the
day
told
nothing
of
her
or
of
her
home
life
they
all
spoke
of
her
as
a
kind
lady
to
work
for
though
as
a
rule
they
had
not
seen
her
but
had
been
engaged
directed
and
paid
by
the
maid
julie
it
seemed
to
be
tacitly
assumed
that
wherever
vicky
was
julie
was
with
her
i
had
had
this
information
from
vicky
herself
but
others
took
it
for
granted
in
the
absence
of
any
reason
to
think
the
contrary
the
whole
day
session
to
my
mind
achieved
little
of
useful
information
reeves
letter
proved
conclusively
that
vicky
was
aware
of
the
search
being
made
for
her
and
showed
her
determination
not
to
be
found
it
was
saturday
and
when
the
inquest
was
adjourned
until
monday
morning
i
could
help
feeling
that
it
might
as
well
have
been
permanently
adjourned
for
all
the
further
conclusions
it
would
lead
to
i
went
home
at
last
thrilling
with
the
thought
that
that
night
i
was
to
get
vicky
mail
from
her
box
and
hide
it
where
she
had
directed
i
secretly
hoped
she
might
be
in
the
house
herself
waiting
for
it
but
scarcely
dared
believe
this
would
be
the
case
chapter
xi
a
note
from
vicky
nor
was
it
i
had
secured
a
to
the
house
from
the
police
who
were
willing
enough
for
me
to
search
for
possible
clues
as
i
had
told
them
i
would
do
at
their
wits
end
to
locate
vicky
van
they
welcomed
my
help
and
felt
that
as
a
friend
of
hers
i
might
learn
more
than
a
disinterested
policeman
could
so
well
after
midnight
watching
my
chance
when
the
patrolman
had
just
passed
on
his
regular
round
i
went
across
the
street
easily
i
opened
the
mailbox
and
extracted
a
quantity
of
letters
quietly
then
i
opened
the
house
door
and
went
in
i
had
provided
myself
with
a
pocket
flashlight
as
i
did
want
to
illuminate
the
house
and
i
went
at
once
to
the
music
room
to
perform
my
errand
how
strange
it
seemed
the
lovely
room
with
dainty
white
and
gold
furnishings
reminded
me
so
forcibly
of
the
bewitching
girl
who
owned
it
all
a
thousand
questions
rose
in
my
mind
what
would
become
of
that
bijou
residence
the
and
pictures
the
rugs
and
furniture
while
not
magnificent
were
of
the
best
and
many
of
them
costly
the
great
chinese
vase
into
which
i
was
to
drop
the
letters
was
a
gem
of
its
kind
though
not
anything
a
connoisseur
would
covet
i
raised
the
lid
and
let
the
letters
fall
in
replacing
the
lid
i
still
lingered
my
errand
was
done
but
i
felt
an
impulse
to
stay
everything
spoke
to
me
of
vicky
van
where
was
she
now
making
sure
that
the
opaque
blinds
were
drawn
i
dared
to
turn
on
one
tiny
electric
lamp
the
faint
light
made
the
shadowed
room
lovelier
than
ever
could
a
girl
of
such
cultivated
tastes
and
such
refinement
of
character
be
a
a
i
could
say
murderer
even
to
myself
then
my
common
sense
flared
up
and
told
me
that
crime
is
no
respecter
of
persons
that
women
who
had
slain
human
beings
were
not
necessarily
of
this
or
that
walk
of
life
granted
a
woman
had
a
motive
to
kill
a
man
that
motive
lay
in
the
impulses
of
her
feminine
nature
and
revenge
jealousy
fear
love
or
hate
whatever
the
motive
it
was
of
deep
and
and
might
find
its
root
in
equal
likeliness
in
the
breast
of
queen
or
beggarmaid
i
could
not
say
vicky
was
incapable
of
crime
indeed
her
gay
volatile
manner
might
hide
a
deeply
perturbed
spirit
she
was
an
enigma
and
i
i
must
solve
the
riddle
i
felt
i
should
never
rest
until
i
knew
the
truth
and
if
vicky
were
a
martyr
to
circumstances
or
a
victim
to
fate
i
must
know
all
about
it
alone
there
in
the
midnight
hours
i
resolved
to
devote
my
time
all
i
could
spare
my
energies
all
i
could
command
and
my
life
so
far
as
i
might
to
the
discovery
of
the
truth
and
i
might
or
might
not
reveal
my
findings
as
seemed
to
me
best
leaving
the
music
room
i
went
back
through
the
long
hall
and
passed
the
door
of
vicky
bedroom
reverently
i
looked
inside
the
very
walls
seemed
crying
for
her
to
come
back
would
she
ever
so
do
i
wandered
on
through
the
bedroom
and
even
looked
in
the
dressing
room
i
felt
no
compunction
it
was
not
from
idle
curiosity
rather
i
walked
as
one
at
a
shrine
the
exquisitely
feminine
boudoir
was
a
mute
witness
to
a
love
of
beauty
and
art
i
used
only
my
flashlight
but
on
an
impulse
i
turned
on
one
light
by
the
side
of
the
long
mirror
i
looked
in
it
as
vicky
must
often
have
done
when
dressing
for
her
parties
as
indeed
she
must
have
done
when
dressing
that
last
fatal
night
and
seeing
my
own
grim
reflection
i
gravely
nodded
my
head
at
myself
and
whispered
we
find
the
truth
old
man
you
see
if
we
do
in
the
ornate
florentine
frame
with
its
branching
arabesques
was
a
strand
of
the
gold
beads
that
had
adorned
vicky
gown
that
night
i
visualized
her
whirling
her
skirts
about
before
the
mirror
with
that
quick
lithe
grace
of
hers
and
catching
the
fluttering
fringe
in
the
gilt
protuberance
perhaps
she
exclaimed
in
petulance
but
more
likely
i
thought
she
laughed
at
the
trivial
accident
that
was
vicky
van
as
i
knew
her
to
laugh
at
a
mischance
and
smile
at
an
accident
i
lifted
the
strand
of
little
beads
from
the
entangling
frame
and
put
it
away
in
my
pocketbook
as
a
dear
and
intimate
souvenir
of
the
girl
i
had
known
then
with
a
final
glance
that
was
a
sort
of
farewell
i
glimpsed
the
pretty
cosy
nest
and
went
downstairs
here
i
paused
again
cassie
weldon
had
said
she
could
see
the
staircase
from
the
door
of
the
i
tried
it
she
was
right
a
person
standing
just
inside
the
door
could
catch
sight
of
a
person
on
the
stairs
and
as
cassie
said
she
was
not
looking
that
way
but
was
partly
conscious
of
some
one
running
up
the
stairs
it
might
well
be
she
would
naturally
give
the
incident
no
thought
at
the
moment
it
was
strange
she
had
even
remembered
it
and
it
may
have
been
vicky
then
she
might
have
descended
by
the
rear
staircase
there
probably
was
one
i
did
know
and
anyway
what
mattered
it
how
she
had
left
the
house
she
had
left
it
and
had
not
returned
i
remembered
the
allusion
to
the
skylight
in
a
jiffy
i
had
run
upstairs
clear
to
the
highest
story
there
was
a
skylight
or
scuttle
rather
and
it
was
bolted
on
the
inside
that
settled
that
vicky
van
had
not
climbed
out
that
way
and
i
for
one
never
supposed
she
had
strangely
reluctant
to
leave
the
house
i
went
downstairs
again
looked
into
the
and
passed
on
to
the
i
contemplated
the
sideboard
in
front
of
which
randolph
schuyler
had
met
his
death
many
pieces
of
silver
and
glass
stood
upon
it
and
all
was
in
order
as
if
it
had
been
carefully
looked
after
for
the
party
occasion
without
consciously
noting
details
i
chanced
to
observe
that
a
small
carving
fork
was
lacking
its
knife
i
had
no
knowledge
of
vicky
van
table
appurtenances
but
the
way
the
fork
lay
looked
to
me
as
if
the
knife
had
lain
across
it
and
had
been
removed
i
had
no
concern
over
it
for
i
knew
the
knife
that
had
stabbed
schuyler
was
now
in
possession
of
the
police
and
this
one
had
doubtless
been
used
in
preparation
of
the
supper
if
indeed
there
was
a
knife
belonging
to
the
fork
it
was
a
matter
of
no
moment
but
somehow
it
stuck
in
my
mind
if
vicky
or
rather
if
julie
had
straightened
up
things
on
the
sideboard
in
the
process
of
tidying
up
for
the
party
would
she
not
have
laid
the
fork
a
different
way
unless
there
had
been
a
matching
knife
to
lay
across
it
i
suppose
the
whole
question
came
into
my
mind
because
at
home
we
had
a
beefsteak
carving
set
that
always
lay
crossed
on
the
sideboard
a
man
gets
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
such
household
details
and
they
photographed
on
his
memory
well
anyway
i
looked
for
that
knife
i
even
went
to
the
pantry
and
looked
but
i
did
see
it
the
pantry
had
been
hastily
evacuated
by
the
caterer
men
and
though
tidied
it
was
not
in
spick
and
span
condition
you
see
having
lived
so
long
with
two
such
homey
bodies
as
aunt
lucy
and
win
i
was
not
utterly
unversed
in
domestic
matters
the
pantry
was
well
equipped
with
modern
utensils
and
implements
and
all
its
appointments
spoke
of
the
taste
and
efficiency
of
its
mistress
poor
vicky
i
sighed
to
myself
poor
dear
little
vicky
van
and
then
i
went
softly
out
of
the
front
door
and
down
the
steps
i
went
slowly
and
looked
back
several
times
in
a
vague
hope
that
vicky
might
emerge
from
some
nearby
shadow
and
go
into
the
house
for
her
letters
but
i
saw
no
sign
of
such
a
happening
and
went
on
home
my
heart
full
of
a
gloomy
foreboding
that
i
would
never
see
her
again
going
to
work
on
sunday
winnie
i
asked
as
next
morning
my
sister
appeared
garbed
for
the
street
not
regularly
to
work
but
schuyler
wants
me
to
look
after
some
matters
of
confidence
oho
how
important
we
are
i
chaffed
her
when
does
the
crowell
lady
come
into
her
own
not
for
another
week
she
is
quite
ready
to
come
and
schuyler
is
willing
to
keep
me
on
a
while
longer
i
do
blame
her
and
i
looked
at
my
pretty
sister
with
approval
i
say
old
girl
i
stroll
over
with
you
come
along
though
i
not
sure
schuyler
will
see
you
she
usually
sends
me
to
receive
callers
well
little
miss
i
could
even
live
through
that
and
perhaps
i
get
a
with
the
fair
that
surely
if
you
wish
they
ready
and
eager
to
see
visitors
i
believe
they
love
to
go
over
the
details
of
the
whole
affair
with
anyone
who
will
listen
oh
come
now
win
not
as
bad
as
that
they
do
think
it
bad
they
bound
to
track
down
the
van
allen
girl
and
they
hold
the
opinion
that
everybody
they
get
hold
of
may
be
an
important
witness
they
go
over
the
reports
from
the
inquest
all
the
time
and
can
hardly
wait
till
tomorrow
to
see
what
will
come
out
next
me
for
them
i
responded
i
like
a
good
chat
on
the
subject
we
went
over
to
the
fifth
avenue
house
and
were
admitted
by
the
solemn
and
butler
i
was
shown
to
the
library
while
winnie
was
directed
to
go
to
schuyler
room
but
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
all
together
in
the
library
widow
sisters
and
all
for
lowney
had
made
a
discovery
and
he
proposed
to
tell
the
family
of
it
win
and
i
were
allowed
to
be
present
and
the
detective
showed
his
new
find
it
seems
he
had
been
searching
the
papers
and
letters
of
the
late
schuyler
this
had
been
not
only
permitted
by
the
wife
but
had
been
urged
by
the
sisters
who
hoped
it
might
result
in
some
further
light
on
the
mysterious
miss
van
allen
and
it
did
in
the
desk
in
a
secret
compartment
which
was
not
so
secret
but
that
the
detective
could
open
it
were
a
number
of
letters
from
feminine
pens
and
a
number
of
receipted
bills
for
jeweled
trinkets
presumably
sent
to
these
or
other
ladies
for
they
were
not
of
a
sort
affected
by
ruth
schuyler
or
the
two
sisters
a
blue
enameled
watch
bracelet
and
a
rhinestone
tiara
were
representative
purchases
entered
on
these
bills
but
the
pile
of
letters
sank
into
insignificance
when
we
learned
the
fact
that
there
was
a
letter
from
vicky
van
among
them
regardless
of
schuyler
feelings
lowney
read
the
letter
aloud
this
was
it
my
dear
schuyler
i
enjoyed
your
supper
party
and
it
was
good
of
you
to
give
me
inside
information
about
the
stocks
but
i
must
beg
of
you
to
cease
your
further
attentions
to
me
as
i
can
not
number
on
my
list
of
calling
acquaintances
the
husband
of
another
woman
i
am
perhaps
rather
prudish
in
my
view
of
life
but
this
is
one
of
my
inviolable
rules
very
truly
yours
victoria
van
allen
i
knew
that
before
vicky
van
living
alone
and
unchaperoned
save
for
the
ubiquitous
julie
flouted
convention
in
many
ways
but
it
was
as
she
said
her
inviolable
rule
to
receive
no
married
man
without
his
wife
at
her
parties
nor
was
there
often
occasion
for
her
to
use
this
stipulation
the
young
people
whom
i
had
met
at
her
house
had
always
been
maids
and
bachelors
and
now
and
then
a
young
married
couple
who
playfully
enacted
a
chaperon
part
reeves
a
widow
was
probably
the
oldest
of
the
crowd
but
she
was
well
under
forty
it
was
quite
true
no
married
man
and
indeed
no
man
of
the
type
or
age
of
randolph
schuyler
had
ever
to
my
knowledge
enjoyed
the
friendship
of
vicky
van
but
not
for
a
minute
did
i
think
that
she
would
go
so
far
as
to
kill
him
for
daring
to
enter
her
house
that
was
unthinkable
and
yet
it
seemed
so
to
lowney
and
apparently
to
the
sisters
of
the
dead
man
she
declared
that
the
letter
proved
that
randolph
had
intruded
on
her
acquaintance
and
she
had
objected
from
coyness
or
coquetry
and
that
when
he
persisted
she
was
so
enraged
that
she
flew
into
a
passion
and
wilfully
ended
his
life
i
ca
think
that
said
ruth
schuyler
wearily
it
seems
more
to
me
as
if
that
letter
exculpates
the
girl
she
was
quite
evidently
not
in
love
with
my
husband
and
she
honestly
tried
to
make
him
understand
her
scruples
so
i
ca
think
she
killed
him
i
did
think
so
at
first
of
course
but
on
thinking
things
over
and
in
the
light
of
this
letter
i
begin
to
believe
her
innocent
what
date
does
the
letter
bear
there
no
date
said
lowney
looking
at
the
paper
it
was
not
in
an
envelope
then
how
did
it
reach
my
husband
oh
of
course
it
came
in
an
envelope
i
suppose
but
i
found
none
with
it
so
we
ca
tell
where
it
was
sent
here
or
to
one
of
his
clubs
or
to
his
office
address
not
here
i
sure
said
schuyler
probably
to
his
club
you
are
quite
welcome
to
the
letter
lowney
make
what
use
you
think
best
of
it
if
it
serves
to
establish
miss
van
allen
innocence
i
shall
be
rather
glad
but
if
it
seems
to
throw
further
suspicion
on
her
then
justice
must
be
done
of
course
it
throws
suspicion
on
that
woman
declared
miss
rhoda
schuyler
with
a
vindictive
glance
at
the
letter
in
lowney
hand
the
hussy
to
write
to
randolph
at
all
but
i
interposed
unable
to
stand
this
unjust
speech
schuyler
must
have
made
advances
to
her
first
she
lured
him
on
i
heard
you
say
yourself
calhoun
that
this
van
allen
person
is
a
siren
a
now
now
miss
rhoda
i
began
but
the
other
sister
chimed
in
of
course
she
is
of
course
the
wrong
was
mostly
hers
and
she
killed
randolph
i
know
it
why
the
waiter
man
saw
her
go
ahead
lowney
hunt
her
down
and
bring
her
to
account
i
never
shall
sleep
peacefully
until
my
brother
death
is
avenged
i
can
not
understand
ruth
how
you
can
be
so
indifferent
a
flush
rose
to
ruth
schuyler
cheek
and
enlightened
anew
to
her
husband
character
by
that
letter
i
began
to
feel
a
different
sort
of
sympathy
for
the
widow
randolph
schuyler
had
been
unfaithful
he
had
been
domineering
and
tyrannical
and
i
knew
he
had
not
allowed
his
wife
to
have
the
comforts
and
luxuries
she
desired
although
he
was
enormously
wealthy
a
social
secretary
for
instance
most
women
of
ruth
schuyler
rank
in
society
had
that
necessary
assistant
yet
during
schuyler
life
his
wife
was
forbidden
the
favor
winnie
had
told
me
this
and
had
told
me
much
more
that
proved
how
unjust
and
unkind
randolph
schuyler
had
been
the
sisters
too
shared
his
views
and
as
a
consequence
the
household
was
run
on
lines
that
ill
accord
with
the
ways
of
schuyler
had
in
no
way
complained
win
told
me
but
it
was
easily
seen
how
matters
stood
it
fell
to
winnie
lot
to
order
many
things
from
the
shops
stationery
mourning
apparel
and
house
needs
these
my
sister
said
were
ordered
with
the
most
perfect
taste
but
with
a
lavishness
which
was
indubitably
unusual
to
ruth
schuyler
the
sisters
exclaimed
at
the
extravagance
but
ruth
though
listening
politely
serenely
went
her
own
way
and
carried
out
her
own
plans
in
the
matter
of
fresh
flowers
she
was
like
a
child
win
said
and
she
enjoyed
the
blossoms
she
ordered
as
if
she
had
hungered
for
them
for
years
winnie
was
growing
deeply
attached
to
her
employer
if
that
word
is
applicable
and
ruth
schuyler
was
fond
of
win
but
i
am
digressing
schuyler
replied
to
her
speech
by
saying
gently
i
am
not
indifferent
sarah
but
it
seems
to
me
we
have
no
real
evidence
against
the
girl
and
no
real
evidence
when
she
was
caught
or
nearly
caught
if
that
stupid
waiter
had
had
sense
enough
to
jump
and
grab
her
we
would
have
had
no
search
to
make
at
all
it
may
be
so
sarah
you
may
be
right
but
until
you
do
find
her
do
condemn
her
utterly
from
what
calhoun
has
told
me
of
her
and
from
the
tone
of
that
letter
she
wrote
to
randolph
i
ca
make
it
seem
possible
that
she
killed
a
man
she
knew
so
slightly
and
yet
it
may
be
she
did
well
remarked
lowney
the
note
proves
that
she
had
seen
schuyler
before
anyway
then
when
he
came
to
her
house
as
somers
she
was
naturally
annoyed
as
she
had
asked
him
not
to
do
so
and
all
that
is
against
the
girl
i
say
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
what
the
coroner
jury
will
think
of
it
they
see
it
in
its
true
light
declared
rhoda
schuyler
of
course
she
was
angry
when
he
came
to
her
house
after
being
forbidden
unless
the
sly
thing
wrote
the
note
just
to
lure
him
on
but
in
any
case
she
was
alone
with
him
she
used
the
knife
on
him
and
she
ran
away
what
more
evidence
do
you
need
now
to
find
her
that
a
task
i
shall
never
give
up
or
neglect
until
i
accomplished
it
and
you
are
right
rhoda
said
ruth
if
the
girl
is
guilty
i
hope
she
will
be
found
for
i
sure
the
truth
could
then
be
learned
whether
she
is
guilty
or
not
will
you
come
now
schuyler
said
tibbetts
from
the
doorway
the
flowers
have
arrived
ruth
beckoning
to
winnie
rose
and
the
two
left
the
room
perfectly
idiotic
said
sarah
the
way
she
orders
flowers
fresh
ones
every
day
but
has
she
a
right
to
spend
her
own
money
as
she
likes
i
defended
a
legal
right
perhaps
was
the
retort
but
not
a
moral
right
to
disregard
her
husband
wishes
so
utterly
chapter
xii
more
notes
next
morning
at
breakfast
there
was
but
one
topic
of
conversation
indeed
little
else
had
been
talked
of
for
days
but
the
schuyler
case
and
all
its
side
issues
winnie
held
forth
at
length
on
the
martyrdom
ruth
schuyler
had
suffered
because
of
the
cruelty
of
her
late
husband
he
was
really
ugly
you
know
explained
win
and
i
do
say
she
glad
he
dead
but
he
thwarted
her
in
every
little
way
that
she
wanted
to
enjoy
herself
they
had
a
box
at
the
opera
and
a
big
country
house
and
all
that
but
he
would
let
her
go
to
matinees
or
have
a
motor
of
her
own
or
buy
anything
until
he
had
passed
judgment
on
it
she
even
had
to
submit
her
costume
designs
to
him
and
if
he
approved
the
dressmaker
made
them
up
and
he
would
let
her
have
fashionable
clothes
they
had
to
be
plain
and
of
rich
heavy
materials
such
as
the
sisters
wear
schuyler
was
under
the
thumb
of
those
two
old
maids
and
rhoda
especially
put
him
up
to
all
sorts
of
schemes
to
bother
ruth
do
you
call
her
ruth
i
asked
in
surprise
yes
she
told
me
i
might
she
lovely
to
me
and
i
so
glad
to
do
all
i
can
for
her
honest
chet
she
lived
an
awful
life
with
that
man
i
like
to
see
her
said
aunt
lucy
all
you
said
about
her
winnie
makes
me
a
bit
curious
so
you
shall
auntie
some
time
she
a
real
friend
of
mine
now
and
even
after
edith
crowell
goes
there
as
secretary
she
says
i
must
often
go
to
see
her
as
her
friend
she
charming
i
declared
every
time
i
see
her
i
more
impressed
with
her
gentle
dignity
and
i
do
know
how
she
can
be
so
decent
to
those
two
old
women
nor
i
agreed
win
as
aunt
lucy
asked
is
she
pretty
is
she
winnie
i
said
well
she
is
and
she
is
she
so
colorless
you
know
her
hair
is
that
flat
ashy
blonde
and
she
so
pale
always
then
her
eyes
and
lashes
are
so
light
and
well
ineffective
but
her
expression
is
so
sweet
and
when
once
in
a
while
she
laughs
outright
she
very
attractive
and
she
such
a
thoroughbred
she
never
errs
in
taste
or
judgment
she
knows
just
what
to
reply
to
all
the
queer
letters
of
condolence
that
come
to
her
and
just
how
to
talk
to
the
people
who
call
and
that
another
thing
she
has
any
friends
of
her
own
age
she
knows
only
the
people
who
belong
to
the
most
exclusive
set
and
they
nearly
all
the
age
of
the
old
sisters
but
schuyler
is
lovely
to
them
and
in
her
soft
pretty
black
gowns
she
looks
a
whole
lot
better
than
she
ever
did
in
the
ones
she
wore
while
he
was
alive
i
seen
them
in
her
wardrobe
and
i
seen
her
try
on
some
that
she
was
going
to
give
away
and
they
sights
elegant
you
know
but
not
the
thing
for
her
now
that
she
can
select
her
own
she
has
beauties
she
certainly
must
be
glad
then
to
be
freed
from
such
a
tyrant
said
aunt
lucy
now
do
you
think
that
insisted
winnie
earnestly
she
may
feel
so
down
in
her
deepest
heart
but
she
wo
admit
it
even
to
herself
and
of
course
no
matter
how
much
she
did
love
him
she
would
want
him
taken
off
way
no
she
perfectly
all
right
and
she
mourns
that
man
just
as
sincerely
as
any
woman
could
mourn
a
man
who
did
understand
her
i
looked
at
win
in
amazement
little
sister
was
growing
up
it
seemed
well
the
experience
would
do
her
no
harm
ruth
schuyler
influence
could
work
only
for
good
and
a
taste
of
real
life
would
give
a
wider
outlook
than
win
could
get
at
home
i
went
down
to
the
coroner
courtroom
the
inquest
was
proceeding
in
its
usual
discursive
way
and
i
sat
down
to
listen
for
a
while
the
coroner
was
hearing
reports
from
detectives
who
had
interviewed
the
market
men
and
shopkeepers
where
vicky
van
had
bought
wares
it
was
just
what
might
be
expected
from
any
householder
record
vicky
had
always
paid
her
bills
promptly
usually
by
check
on
a
bank
sometimes
if
the
bills
were
small
they
were
paid
in
cash
in
such
case
miss
van
allen
herself
or
the
maid
brought
the
money
if
checks
they
were
sent
by
mail
the
garage
man
reported
a
similar
state
of
affairs
his
monthly
bills
were
promptly
paid
and
miss
van
allen
had
found
no
fault
with
his
service
she
was
away
from
home
frequently
but
when
at
home
she
used
her
motor
car
often
and
was
kind
to
the
chauffeur
who
drove
her
this
chauffeur
told
of
taking
her
to
the
shops
to
the
theatre
to
friends
houses
and
to
picture
galleries
but
had
never
been
directed
to
any
place
where
a
lady
might
not
go
the
bank
people
said
that
miss
van
allen
had
had
an
account
with
them
for
years
but
as
their
depositors
were
entitled
to
confidential
dealings
they
would
say
little
more
they
stated
however
that
miss
van
allen
was
a
most
desirable
patron
and
never
overdrew
her
account
or
made
trouble
of
any
sort
there
was
nothing
to
be
gleaned
from
this
kind
of
testimony
we
all
knew
that
vicky
was
a
good
citizen
and
all
this
was
merely
corroboration
what
was
wanted
was
some
hint
of
her
present
whereabouts
lowney
had
tried
to
get
at
this
by
the
use
of
an
address
book
he
had
found
in
vicky
van
desk
he
had
telephoned
or
called
on
many
of
the
people
whose
addresses
were
in
the
book
but
all
said
over
and
over
what
we
already
knew
personally
i
felt
sure
that
vicky
was
staying
with
some
friend
not
far
from
her
own
house
it
could
well
be
that
somebody
cared
enough
for
the
girl
to
hide
her
from
the
authorities
this
however
argued
her
guilty
for
otherwise
a
true
friend
would
persuade
her
that
the
wiser
course
would
be
to
disclose
herself
to
the
public
however
nothing
transpired
to
bear
out
my
opinion
and
as
the
list
of
witnesses
dwindled
no
progress
was
made
toward
a
solution
of
the
mystery
and
so
when
at
last
an
open
verdict
was
returned
with
no
mention
of
vicky
name
i
was
decidedly
relieved
but
i
did
see
how
it
could
have
been
otherwise
i
dropped
in
at
the
schuyler
house
on
my
way
home
i
was
beginning
to
feel
on
a
very
friendly
footing
there
and
partly
owing
to
graphic
powers
of
narration
i
took
an
increasing
interest
in
ruth
schuyler
as
win
had
said
she
looked
charming
although
pathetic
in
her
black
robes
she
permitted
herself
a
touch
of
white
at
the
throat
and
a
white
flower
was
tucked
in
her
bodice
a
contrast
indeed
to
the
severe
garb
of
the
spinster
sisters
who
looked
like
allegorical
figures
of
hopeless
gloom
but
their
manner
was
more
of
militant
revenge
and
having
heard
the
verdict
of
the
coroner
jury
they
were
ready
to
take
up
the
case
themselves
come
in
calhoun
they
called
out
as
i
entered
the
library
you
just
the
man
we
want
to
see
now
that
the
coroner
has
finished
his
task
we
will
take
the
matter
up
lowney
i
suppose
will
continue
the
search
for
miss
van
allen
but
we
fear
he
will
not
be
successful
so
we
have
determined
to
send
for
the
great
detective
fleming
stone
stone
i
cried
why
he
wo
work
with
the
police
then
he
can
work
without
them
declared
rhoda
with
asperity
heard
wonderful
stories
of
that
man
success
and
we
going
to
engage
him
at
once
he
very
expensive
i
began
no
matter
we
going
to
find
our
brother
murderer
if
it
takes
every
penny
of
our
fortune
what
do
you
think
of
this
plan
mrs
schuyler
i
asked
i
not
been
consulted
she
said
with
a
slight
smile
since
randolph
sisters
choose
to
adopt
it
i
have
no
reason
to
object
i
know
nothing
of
stone
but
if
he
is
really
a
great
detective
he
will
not
condemn
that
girl
unheard
and
if
she
is
proved
guilty
of
course
the
claims
of
justice
must
be
met
do
you
know
him
mr
calhoun
not
personally
i
often
heard
of
him
and
he
a
wonder
if
you
want
to
find
miss
van
allen
you
ca
do
better
than
to
get
him
on
the
trail
if
he
ca
find
her
nobody
can
that
what
i
say
put
in
sarah
and
if
he
does
find
her
at
least
we
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
we
done
all
we
could
we
thought
of
offering
a
reward
for
information
of
miss
van
allen
added
rhoda
but
if
we
going
to
get
stone
would
it
be
better
to
consult
him
about
that
i
think
it
would
i
judged
just
then
winnie
came
into
the
room
she
had
been
writing
notes
and
she
held
a
lot
of
unopened
letters
in
her
hand
oh
ruth
she
cried
what
do
you
think
here
the
mail
jepson
just
gave
it
to
me
and
there
a
letter
for
you
from
miss
van
allen
what
cried
everybody
at
once
yes
declared
winnie
i
know
the
hand
it
the
same
as
was
on
that
letter
to
schuyler
it
such
a
queer
hand
you
ca
forget
it
she
handed
all
the
letters
to
ruth
the
one
she
referred
to
on
top
schuyler
turned
pale
as
she
looked
at
the
envelope
i
glanced
at
it
too
and
without
doubt
it
was
vicky
van
writing
it
had
been
mailed
in
new
york
that
same
morning
and
delivered
just
now
about
five
you
open
it
calhoun
said
ruth
as
if
she
shrank
from
the
task
i
took
it
gravely
for
it
seemed
to
me
to
portend
trouble
for
little
vicky
was
she
giving
herself
up
or
what
win
handed
me
a
and
i
slit
the
envelope
as
they
breathlessly
awaited
my
words
i
read
to
randolph
schuyler
dear
madam
it
is
useless
to
look
for
me
i
am
leaving
new
york
forever
the
mystery
of
schuyler
death
will
never
be
solved
the
truth
never
learned
i
alone
know
the
secret
and
it
will
die
with
me
you
may
employ
detectives
from
now
till
doomsday
but
you
will
discover
nothing
so
give
up
the
search
for
you
will
never
find
victoria
van
allen
there
was
a
pause
as
i
finished
reading
myself
i
was
thrilled
by
a
certain
phrase
in
the
letter
vicky
said
the
secret
will
die
with
me
again
i
felt
that
she
was
intending
to
bring
about
her
own
death
and
that
speedily
would
we
know
it
if
she
did
i
was
thinking
deeply
when
miss
rhoda
spoke
i
believe
that
girl
means
to
kill
herself
and
i
should
think
she
would
why
do
you
think
that
and
ruth
looked
up
with
a
startled
face
it
sounds
so
and
it
would
be
the
natural
outcome
of
her
remorse
at
her
dreadful
deed
i
think
she
must
be
guilty
said
winnie
her
dear
little
countenance
drawn
with
grief
as
she
studied
the
letter
for
herself
none
of
us
said
much
more
we
all
were
stunned
in
a
way
by
this
unexpected
development
and
had
to
readjust
our
theories
well
miss
rhoda
said
decidedly
i
shall
consult
stone
anyway
i
written
him
and
though
i
not
mailed
the
letter
yet
i
shall
send
it
off
then
when
he
comes
to
talk
it
over
we
can
see
what
he
says
and
abide
by
his
judgment
that
a
good
idea
rhoda
and
ruth
schuyler
nodded
assentingly
i
too
want
justice
and
if
fleming
stone
thinks
he
can
find
miss
van
allen
let
him
do
so
it
was
six
then
and
win
and
i
went
home
leaving
the
schuyler
ladies
to
their
own
discussions
ruth
schuyler
hand
lingered
a
moment
in
mine
as
i
bade
her
adieu
and
she
said
wistfully
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
just
what
you
think
we
had
better
do
i
am
so
unaccustomed
to
judging
for
myself
in
any
important
matter
i
think
it
is
wise
to
get
stone
i
returned
in
any
case
it
can
do
no
harm
you
know
no
i
suppose
not
and
she
gave
me
one
of
her
rare
smiles
of
appreciation
i
am
glad
you
are
looking
after
us
instead
of
bradbury
she
said
further
and
i
sincerely
responded
that
i
was
glad
too
another
surprise
awaited
me
at
home
on
the
hall
table
lay
my
own
mail
and
as
i
picked
it
up
and
ran
the
letters
over
there
was
one
from
vicky
van
i
hastily
concealed
it
from
winnie
sharp
eyes
for
i
had
no
notion
what
it
might
divulge
and
hurried
with
it
up
to
my
own
room
impatiently
i
tore
it
open
and
raced
through
its
contents
dear
calhoun
thank
you
deeply
for
attending
to
my
errand
owing
to
your
kindness
i
received
the
letters
i
wanted
now
will
you
do
me
one
last
favor
come
again
to
the
house
tonight
and
take
a
small
parcel
which
you
will
find
in
the
chinese
jar
in
the
music
room
keep
this
for
me
and
if
i
do
not
ask
you
for
it
within
a
year
destroy
it
unopened
i
wish
i
could
be
more
frank
with
you
you
have
proved
yourself
such
a
staunch
friend
but
i
can
not
control
circumstances
and
so
i
must
bear
my
fate
i
do
not
know
what
schuyler
will
think
of
it
but
i
have
written
her
a
letter
when
you
see
her
try
to
make
her
realize
it
is
useless
to
hunt
for
me
since
i
can
keep
hidden
for
this
length
of
time
my
retreat
is
not
likely
to
be
discovered
and
now
my
kindest
of
friends
vicky
van
i
stood
staring
at
the
letter
i
read
it
through
a
dozen
times
of
course
i
would
do
her
bidding
but
my
heart
rebelled
at
the
finality
of
the
lines
i
knew
i
would
never
hear
from
vicky
van
again
as
she
said
since
we
had
traced
her
yet
we
never
could
i
wondered
where
she
could
possibly
be
and
julie
too
somebody
was
shielding
them
both
they
could
be
disguised
or
anything
of
that
sort
for
they
had
left
the
house
at
dead
of
night
without
luggage
or
and
i
had
thought
of
this
before
without
money
how
could
they
have
found
shelter
save
in
some
friend
house
of
course
vicky
could
have
snatched
up
a
purse
as
she
ran
perhaps
that
was
what
she
flew
upstairs
for
and
then
maybe
she
went
down
the
back
stairs
but
no
the
waiters
must
have
seen
her
that
way
and
luigi
was
in
the
front
hall
a
moment
after
vicky
disappeared
aside
from
my
personal
interest
i
hated
to
think
i
should
never
know
just
how
she
did
get
away
for
now
i
had
no
hope
that
fleming
stone
or
anyone
else
could
ever
find
the
girl
she
was
too
canny
to
be
taken
after
her
successful
concealment
so
far
i
went
downstairs
after
a
time
but
i
said
nothing
of
my
letter
to
aunt
lucy
or
win
they
were
eagerly
discussing
the
latest
news
and
aunt
lucy
was
saying
yes
i
heard
of
stone
and
they
do
say
he
a
marvel
i
hope
he
find
the
girl
if
only
to
learn
the
mystery
of
her
disappearance
oh
he
find
her
assured
winnie
i
heard
a
lot
about
him
over
there
and
he
a
wizard
but
i
think
he
have
a
long
chase
meantime
what
becomes
of
the
house
queried
aunt
lucy
what
does
chet
can
anyone
go
in
it
who
likes
no
i
returned
a
little
shortly
for
i
foresaw
aunt
lucy
had
that
absurd
feminine
desire
to
pry
into
another
person
home
it
in
charge
of
the
police
and
they
wo
let
anyone
in
without
some
very
good
reason
could
you
get
in
i
suppose
i
might
i
admitted
unwillingly
if
i
had
any
business
there
oh
do
get
up
some
business
chet
begged
winnie
and
get
the
keys
and
let
auntie
and
me
go
with
you
oh
do
i
love
to
see
that
things
winnie
you
positively
lowbred
to
show
such
curiosity
i
exclaimed
angrily
the
more
so
that
i
had
the
house
key
in
my
pocket
at
that
moment
but
i
was
glad
i
had
not
told
them
of
vicky
letter
to
me
i
waited
until
well
past
midnight
and
then
after
seeing
the
post
patrol
pass
vicky
door
i
softly
went
out
of
my
own
house
and
across
the
street
i
walked
calmly
up
the
steps
of
vicky
home
and
sadly
put
the
latchkey
in
the
door
for
the
last
time
i
felt
as
if
i
were
performing
funeral
rites
and
i
entered
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
softly
as
one
does
in
the
house
of
death
i
went
up
the
stairs
in
the
gloom
it
was
not
black
darkness
for
a
partly
raised
blind
gave
me
a
glimmer
of
light
from
the
street
into
the
music
room
i
went
and
by
my
pocket
flashlight
i
took
the
lid
from
the
chinese
jar
but
there
was
no
parcel
inside
amazed
i
threw
the
light
down
into
the
big
vase
but
it
was
utterly
empty
there
was
no
use
looking
elsewhere
for
the
parcel
i
knew
vicky
well
enough
to
know
that
she
would
do
exactly
as
she
had
said
or
since
she
had
i
was
sure
that
she
would
not
have
left
that
parcel
in
any
other
i
put
the
flashlight
back
in
my
pocket
and
started
downstairs
slowly
i
descended
for
i
still
felt
a
little
uncertain
what
to
do
should
i
wait
for
a
short
time
or
go
back
home
and
return
again
later
i
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
concluded
to
go
home
and
then
think
out
my
next
step
as
i
passed
the
door
i
heard
a
low
voice
whisper
my
name
i
turned
sharply
in
the
doorway
i
could
dimly
discern
a
cloaked
figure
hush
she
said
softly
and
beckoned
to
me
it
was
vicky
van
chapter
xiii
fleming
stone
vicky
had
said
hush
but
it
was
an
unnecessary
precaution
for
i
was
too
stunned
to
articulate
i
peered
at
her
in
the
darkness
and
then
unable
to
control
my
desire
for
certainty
i
flashed
my
little
pocket
light
on
her
for
an
instant
do
she
whispered
putting
her
hands
up
before
her
face
but
i
had
seen
it
was
really
vicky
van
her
smooth
black
hair
looped
over
her
ears
her
scarlet
mouth
and
soft
pink
cheeks
flushed
with
excitement
of
the
moment
and
her
long
dark
lashes
which
suddenly
fell
beneath
the
blinding
flare
of
the
light
all
were
those
of
the
runaway
girl
do
talk
she
said
hastily
let
me
do
the
talking
i
want
you
to
help
me
will
you
of
course
i
will
and
all
sense
of
law
and
justice
fled
before
the
wave
of
pity
and
solicitude
for
the
trembling
suppliant
who
thus
appealed
to
me
her
voice
was
indistinct
and
a
little
hoarse
as
if
she
was
laboring
under
great
mental
and
nerve
strain
and
she
was
so
alone
so
unprotected
that
i
could
help
promising
any
assistance
in
my
power
there
was
any
parcel
in
the
big
vase
i
said
in
a
low
voice
as
she
seemed
to
hesitate
about
going
on
with
her
explanation
no
here
it
is
and
she
handed
me
a
little
box
just
put
it
away
safely
for
the
present
and
now
this
is
what
i
want
to
ask
of
you
do
let
them
engage
that
stone
to
hunt
me
down
will
you
why
how
can
i
help
it
oh
ca
you
and
she
sounded
so
disappointed
i
hoped
you
could
persuade
schuyler
not
to
have
him
but
schuyler
does
want
him
either
i
exclaimed
it
those
two
sisters
who
insist
on
getting
him
and
i
never
could
turn
their
wills
try
as
i
might
why
does
schuyler
want
him
oh
i
not
sure
that
she
really
objects
to
the
plan
but
i
mean
she
did
seem
as
anxious
as
the
other
two
you
see
little
girl
the
widow
of
randolph
schuyler
is
so
bitter
against
you
as
the
two
sisters
are
that
good
of
her
and
vicky
voice
was
wistful
but
you
know
i
must
remain
in
hiding
i
thought
you
were
going
to
leave
new
york
i
am
and
at
once
but
if
that
stone
gets
on
my
trail
he
find
me
as
sure
as
fate
and
so
i
risked
this
interview
to
try
to
persuade
you
to
use
your
influence
against
his
coming
and
i
do
that
i
returned
heartily
but
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
i
doubt
my
power
to
dissuade
the
schuyler
sisters
from
their
determination
and
too
how
did
you
know
they
thought
of
getting
him
oh
i
see
all
the
papers
you
know
and
in
one
of
them
a
reporter
gave
a
personal
interview
with
the
schuyler
people
and
they
hinted
at
getting
that
man
vicky
sighed
wearily
as
if
her
last
hope
was
gone
i
was
full
of
questions
i
wanted
to
ask
her
but
it
seemed
intrusive
and
unkind
to
quiz
her
and
yet
one
thing
i
felt
i
must
say
i
must
ask
her
what
she
knew
of
the
actual
crime
tell
me
i
blurted
out
who
did
kill
randolph
schuyler
again
i
felt
her
tremble
and
her
voice
quivered
as
she
whispered
back
it
must
have
been
some
enemy
of
his
who
got
in
at
the
window
or
something
like
that
my
heart
fell
this
was
the
sort
of
thing
she
would
say
if
she
were
herself
the
guilty
one
i
had
hoped
for
a
more
sincere
even
if
despairing
answer
but
i
must
send
you
away
she
breathed
in
my
ear
we
were
standing
just
inside
the
room
and
vicky
held
her
hand
on
a
for
support
there
was
the
faintest
light
from
the
street
enough
for
us
to
distinguish
one
another
forms
but
no
more
vicky
wore
a
street
gown
of
some
sort
and
a
long
cloak
on
her
head
was
a
small
hat
and
a
black
net
veil
this
was
tied
so
tightly
that
it
interfered
a
little
with
her
speech
i
thought
though
when
i
had
looked
at
her
face
by
my
flashlight
the
veil
had
not
been
of
sufficient
thickness
to
conceal
her
features
at
all
i
often
wondered
why
women
wear
those
uncomfortable
things
she
kept
pulling
it
away
from
her
lips
as
she
talked
i
want
my
address
book
she
went
on
hurriedly
i
looked
all
over
for
it
and
it
gone
did
the
detective
take
it
i
think
he
did
i
replied
remembering
lowney
search
ca
you
get
it
back
for
me
look
here
child
what
do
you
think
i
am
a
magician
no
but
i
thought
you
could
manage
somehow
to
get
it
her
voice
showed
the
adorable
petulance
that
distinguished
vicky
van
and
then
you
could
send
it
to
me
where
i
cried
eagerly
where
shall
i
address
you
i
ca
tell
you
that
but
you
can
bring
it
here
and
leave
it
in
the
chinese
jar
and
i
will
get
it
how
do
you
come
in
and
go
out
of
this
house
without
being
seen
i
demanded
by
the
area
door
perhaps
so
and
she
spoke
lightly
and
perhaps
by
a
window
and
maybe
by
means
of
an
aeroplane
and
down
through
the
skylight
not
that
i
said
the
skylight
is
fastened
on
the
inside
and
has
been
ever
since
ever
since
that
night
well
then
i
do
come
that
way
but
if
you
get
that
book
and
put
it
in
the
big
vase
i
come
and
get
it
when
will
it
be
there
you
crazy
to
think
i
can
get
it
i
returned
slowly
but
if
i
can
i
will
give
me
a
few
days
a
week
if
you
like
shall
we
say
a
week
from
next
monday
yes
if
i
can
get
it
at
all
i
can
have
it
by
then
how
shall
i
let
you
know
you
need
let
me
know
for
i
know
now
you
will
get
it
steal
it
from
lowney
if
you
ca
get
it
otherwise
but
if
fleming
stone
is
on
your
trail
will
you
come
for
the
book
i
must
she
spoke
gravely
i
must
have
the
book
it
means
everything
to
me
i
have
it
then
you
shall
if
i
can
manage
it
it
is
your
book
it
has
proved
of
no
value
as
evidence
you
may
as
well
have
it
yes
i
may
as
well
have
it
and
now
calhoun
will
you
go
please
or
do
you
intend
to
turn
me
over
to
the
police
vicky
i
cried
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
of
course
i
go
if
you
bid
me
but
let
me
wait
a
minute
you
know
you
wrote
to
ruth
schuyler
ruth
is
that
one
of
the
old
sisters
no
ruth
is
the
widow
oh
yes
i
wrote
to
her
i
did
know
her
first
name
i
wrote
because
i
thought
it
was
she
who
is
making
the
desperate
search
for
me
and
i
hoped
i
could
influence
her
to
stop
it
that
all
i
have
no
interest
in
randolph
schuyler
widow
except
as
she
affects
my
future
but
can
you
do
anything
by
working
in
the
other
direction
i
mean
can
you
dissuade
fleming
stone
from
coming
by
asking
him
not
to
you
can
bribe
him
perhaps
i
have
money
oh
i
doubt
if
i
could
do
anything
like
that
but
i
try
i
try
every
way
i
can
and
if
i
succeed
how
shall
i
let
you
know
oh
i
know
if
he
takes
up
the
matter
it
will
probably
get
into
the
papers
and
if
i
see
nothing
of
it
i
conclude
you
succeeded
but
i
i
want
to
see
you
again
vicky
oh
no
you
do
why
you
do
know
this
minute
but
what
i
stabbed
that
man
and
you
did
vicky
tell
me
you
did
i
ca
tell
you
that
i
ca
tell
you
anything
i
am
the
most
miserable
girl
on
god
earth
and
i
heard
tears
in
vicky
voice
and
a
sob
choked
her
utterance
now
go
she
said
after
a
moment
i
ca
stand
any
more
please
go
and
do
what
you
can
for
me
without
getting
yourself
into
trouble
go
and
do
look
back
to
see
how
i
make
my
exit
will
you
indeed
i
wo
do
that
your
confidences
are
safe
with
me
vicky
and
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
help
you
in
any
way
i
can
then
go
now
she
said
and
a
gentle
pressure
of
her
hand
on
my
arm
urged
me
toward
the
door
i
went
without
another
word
and
neither
while
in
the
street
nor
after
gaining
my
own
house
did
i
look
back
for
another
glimpse
of
vicky
van
and
yet
try
as
i
would
maneuver
as
i
might
i
could
prevent
the
arrival
of
fleming
stone
the
schuyler
sisters
were
determined
to
have
the
great
detective
and
though
schuyler
was
so
anxious
yet
she
raised
not
the
slightest
objection
and
after
some
persuasion
stone
agreed
to
take
the
case
i
was
present
at
his
first
call
to
discuss
details
and
was
immensely
interested
in
my
first
sight
of
the
man
tall
and
of
a
gravely
courteous
manner
he
impressed
me
as
the
most
magnetically
attractive
man
i
had
ever
seen
his
hair
and
dark
eyes
gave
him
a
dignity
that
i
had
never
before
associated
with
my
notions
of
a
detective
the
schuyler
sisters
were
frankly
delighted
with
him
i
know
you
run
down
the
murderer
of
my
brother
miss
rhoda
exulted
while
miss
sarah
began
to
babble
volubly
of
what
she
called
clues
and
evidence
fleming
stone
listened
politely
now
and
then
asking
a
direct
question
and
sometimes
turning
to
ruth
schuyler
for
further
information
as
i
watched
him
closely
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
really
paid
little
attention
to
what
the
women
said
he
was
more
engaged
in
scanning
their
faces
and
noting
their
attitudes
perhaps
i
imagined
it
but
i
thought
he
was
sizing
up
their
characters
and
their
sympathies
and
intended
looking
up
his
clues
and
evidence
by
himself
the
first
thing
to
do
he
declared
at
last
is
to
find
miss
van
allen
this
was
what
i
had
feared
and
remembering
my
promise
to
vicky
i
said
i
think
that
will
be
impossible
stone
she
wrote
she
was
leaving
new
york
forever
but
a
householder
like
that
ca
go
away
forever
stone
said
she
must
look
after
her
goods
and
chattels
and
she
must
pay
her
rent
no
she
owns
the
house
must
pay
the
taxes
then
must
sell
it
or
rent
it
or
do
something
with
it
it
would
seem
so
i
agreed
and
yet
if
one
is
wanted
for
murder
one
would
sacrifice
household
goods
and
the
house
itself
in
order
to
escape
being
caught
true
and
stone
nodded
his
head
but
still
i
fancy
she
would
return
for
something
few
women
could
leave
their
home
like
that
and
not
have
some
valuables
or
some
secret
papers
or
something
for
which
they
must
return
i
venture
to
say
miss
van
allen
has
already
been
back
to
her
house
more
than
once
on
secret
errands
was
the
man
a
clairvoyant
how
could
he
know
that
vicky
had
done
this
very
thing
but
i
realized
at
once
that
he
knew
it
not
from
cognizance
of
facts
but
from
his
prescience
of
what
would
necessarily
follow
in
such
a
case
she
has
her
keys
of
course
he
asked
the
police
have
charge
of
the
keys
i
said
a
little
lamely
i
know
stone
said
impatiently
but
there
are
doubtless
more
keys
than
the
ones
they
have
i
should
say
that
miss
van
allen
took
at
least
the
key
of
one
door
with
her
however
hurried
her
flight
it
may
be
so
i
conceded
but
granting
she
has
been
back
and
forth
on
the
errands
you
suggest
it
is
not
likely
she
will
keep
it
up
no
it
is
not
and
especially
if
she
learns
i
am
on
the
case
how
could
she
know
that
ruth
schuyler
asked
i
sure
miss
van
allen
is
a
most
clever
and
ingenious
young
woman
stone
replied
and
i
feel
sure
she
knows
all
that
is
going
on
she
gets
information
from
the
papers
and
too
she
has
that
dependable
maid
julie
that
woman
probably
disguised
can
do
much
in
the
way
of
getting
information
as
to
how
matters
are
progressing
you
see
followed
the
case
all
the
way
along
and
the
peculiarities
and
unique
conditions
of
it
are
what
induced
me
to
take
it
up
shall
we
offer
a
reward
stone
for
the
discovery
of
the
hiding
place
of
miss
van
allen
asked
rhoda
eagerly
i
want
to
use
every
possible
means
of
finding
her
not
yet
miss
schuyler
let
us
try
other
plans
first
but
i
must
enjoin
utter
secrecy
about
my
connection
with
the
matter
not
the
fact
that
i
am
at
work
on
it
but
the
developments
or
details
of
my
work
it
is
a
most
unusual
a
most
peculiar
case
and
i
must
work
unimpeded
by
outside
advice
or
interference
i
may
say
i
never
known
of
a
case
which
presented
such
extraordinary
features
and
features
which
will
either
greatly
simplify
or
greatly
impede
my
progress
just
what
do
you
mean
by
that
last
remark
mr
stone
asked
ruth
schuyler
who
had
been
listening
intently
i
mean
that
the
absolutely
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
young
woman
will
either
be
of
easy
and
simple
solution
or
else
it
will
prove
an
insoluble
mystery
there
will
be
no
work
about
it
if
i
ca
learn
the
truth
in
a
short
time
i
fear
i
never
can
how
strange
said
i
do
you
often
feel
thus
about
the
beginning
of
a
case
very
rarely
almost
never
and
never
have
i
felt
it
so
strongly
as
in
this
instance
to
trace
that
girl
is
not
a
matter
of
long
and
patient
search
it
rather
a
question
of
a
bit
of
luck
or
a
slight
slip
on
her
part
or
well
of
some
coincidence
or
chance
discovery
that
will
clear
things
at
one
flash
then
you
depending
on
luck
exclaimed
rhoda
in
a
disappointed
tone
oh
not
that
and
stone
smiled
at
least
i
not
depending
entirely
on
that
if
luck
comes
my
way
so
much
the
better
and
now
please
let
me
see
the
notes
miss
van
allen
has
written
none
was
available
however
except
the
one
to
ruth
schuyler
for
the
one
to
randolph
schuyler
was
in
lowney
possession
and
the
one
i
had
had
from
vicky
and
which
was
even
then
in
my
pocket
i
had
no
intention
of
showing
it
was
not
necessary
however
for
fleming
stone
said
one
was
enough
to
gather
all
that
he
could
learn
from
her
chirography
he
studied
it
attentively
but
only
for
a
moment
then
he
said
a
characteristic
penmanship
but
to
me
it
only
shows
forcefulness
ingenuity
and
good
nature
however
i
not
an
expert
i
only
get
a
general
impression
and
the
traits
i
mentioned
are
undoubtedly
to
be
found
in
the
lady
nature
are
they
not
and
he
turned
to
me
as
to
one
who
knew
they
are
i
replied
so
far
as
i
know
miss
van
allen
but
my
acquaintance
with
her
is
limited
and
i
can
only
agree
superficially
stone
eyed
me
closely
and
i
began
to
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
under
his
gaze
clearly
i
have
to
tell
the
truth
or
incur
his
suspicion
nor
did
i
wish
to
prevaricate
i
felt
friendly
toward
poor
little
vicky
and
yet
i
had
no
mind
to
run
counter
to
the
interest
of
ruth
schuyler
the
two
sisters
i
did
worry
about
and
indeed
they
could
look
out
for
themselves
but
ruth
schuyler
was
in
a
position
to
demand
justice
and
if
that
justice
accused
vicky
van
i
must
be
honest
and
fair
to
both
in
my
testimony
fleming
stone
proceeded
to
question
the
women
more
definitely
and
concisely
now
and
by
virtue
of
his
marvellous
efficiency
he
so
shaped
his
inquiries
that
he
learned
details
with
accuracy
and
rapidity
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
to
ask
the
questions
that
he
put
but
as
he
went
on
i
saw
their
pertinence
and
value
with
ruth
permission
he
called
several
of
the
servants
and
asked
them
a
few
things
nothing
of
moment
transpired
to
my
mind
but
stone
was
interested
in
a
full
account
of
where
each
servant
was
and
what
he
was
doing
on
the
night
of
the
murder
each
gave
a
straightforward
and
satisfactory
account
and
i
realized
that
stone
was
only
getting
a
sense
of
the
household
atmosphere
and
its
relations
to
schuyler
himself
tibbetts
the
maid
of
ruth
schuyler
told
of
the
shock
to
her
mistress
when
the
news
was
brought
schuyler
had
retired
said
tibbetts
at
about
ten
schuyler
was
out
and
was
not
expected
home
until
late
i
attended
her
and
after
she
was
in
bed
i
went
to
bed
myself
i
told
you
do
not
live
here
commented
stone
though
in
a
disinterested
way
and
at
the
same
time
making
notes
of
some
other
matters
in
his
notebook
i
have
a
room
around
on
third
avenue
replied
tibbetts
i
like
a
little
home
of
my
own
and
when
schuyler
permits
me
i
go
there
to
sleep
and
sometimes
i
go
in
the
daylight
hours
but
on
that
night
i
happened
to
be
staying
here
tibbetts
is
rather
a
privileged
character
interposed
ruth
she
has
been
with
me
for
many
years
and
as
she
likes
a
little
place
of
her
own
i
adopted
the
plan
of
which
she
has
told
you
but
that
night
you
were
here
said
stone
to
the
maid
yes
sir
i
slept
in
schuyler
dressing
room
as
i
always
do
when
i
here
then
when
jepson
told
me
the
the
awful
news
i
awoke
schuyler
and
told
her
yes
said
stone
i
read
all
about
that
in
the
inquest
report
chapter
xiv
walls
have
tongues
now
said
fleming
stone
after
he
had
learned
all
he
desired
from
the
schuyler
household
now
if
you
please
i
would
like
to
go
over
the
van
allen
house
you
have
the
keys
mr
calhoun
i
have
a
latchkey
to
the
street
door
i
replied
the
rooms
are
not
locked
i
do
know
why
exactly
but
i
hated
to
have
him
go
through
vicky
van
house
of
course
it
must
have
been
because
she
had
begged
me
not
to
let
stone
get
into
the
case
at
all
but
i
had
been
able
to
prevent
that
the
two
schuyler
sisters
being
determined
to
have
him
and
i
had
no
desire
to
impede
justice
or
stand
in
the
way
of
law
and
order
but
somehow
or
other
i
felt
the
invasion
of
vicky
home
would
bring
about
trouble
for
the
girl
and
my
mind
was
filled
with
vague
foreboding
we
will
go
with
you
announced
miss
rhoda
i
wanted
to
see
that
house
from
the
first
you
go
ruth
oh
no
and
ruth
schuyler
shrank
at
the
idea
i
no
wish
to
see
the
place
where
my
husband
was
killed
how
could
you
think
of
it
if
i
could
do
any
good
by
going
no
schuyler
said
fleming
stone
you
could
do
no
good
and
i
quite
understand
why
you
would
rather
not
go
the
misses
schuyler
and
calhoun
will
accompany
me
and
we
will
start
at
once
ca
i
go
asked
winnie
who
had
come
in
recently
i
just
crazy
to
see
that
house
you
do
mind
my
going
do
you
ruth
no
indeed
child
i
perfectly
willing
stone
raised
no
objection
so
winnie
went
with
us
it
was
nearly
five
full
daylight
though
the
dusk
was
just
beginning
to
fall
we
went
round
to
vicky
van
and
i
opened
the
door
for
the
party
to
enter
the
house
had
begun
to
show
disuse
there
was
dust
on
the
shining
surfaces
of
the
furniture
and
on
the
polished
floors
the
clocks
had
all
stopped
and
the
musty
chill
of
a
closed
house
was
in
the
atmosphere
ugh
cried
winnie
what
a
creepy
feeling
and
this
house
is
too
pretty
to
be
so
neglected
why
it
a
darling
house
look
at
that
heavenly
color
scheme
winnie
had
darted
into
the
with
its
rose
and
gray
appointments
and
we
all
followed
her
do
touch
anything
miss
calhoun
cautioned
stone
and
win
contented
herself
with
gazing
about
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
the
schuyler
sisters
sniffed
and
though
they
said
little
they
conveyed
the
idea
that
to
their
minds
the
bijou
residence
savored
of
reprehensible
frivolity
fleming
stone
lived
up
to
his
reputation
as
a
detective
and
scrutinized
everything
with
quick
comprehensive
glances
we
went
through
the
long
and
into
the
whose
pale
green
and
silver
again
enchanted
winnie
the
walls
are
exquisite
stone
agreed
looking
closely
at
the
panels
of
silk
brocade
framed
with
a
silver
tracery
if
walls
have
ears
they
must
burn
at
your
praise
i
said
in
an
effort
to
speak
lightly
for
stone
face
had
an
ominous
look
as
if
he
were
learning
grave
truths
walls
not
only
have
ears
they
have
tongues
he
returned
these
walls
have
already
told
me
much
of
miss
van
allen
character
oh
how
cried
winnie
do
tell
us
how
you
deduce
and
all
that
i
looked
hastily
at
stone
thinking
he
might
be
annoyed
by
volatile
speech
but
he
said
kindly
to
the
trained
eye
miss
calhoun
much
is
apparent
that
escapes
the
casual
observer
but
you
can
understand
that
the
taste
displayed
in
the
wall
decoration
shows
a
refined
and
cultured
nature
a
woman
of
the
adventuress
type
would
prefer
more
garish
display
of
course
i
am
generalizing
but
there
is
much
to
bear
me
out
then
i
see
by
certain
tiny
marks
and
cracks
that
these
walls
have
lately
been
done
over
and
that
they
were
also
redecorated
another
time
not
long
before
this
proves
that
miss
van
allen
has
money
enough
to
gratify
her
whims
and
she
chooses
to
spend
it
in
satisfying
her
aesthetic
preferences
further
the
walls
have
been
carefully
cared
for
showing
an
interested
and
capable
housekeeperly
instinct
and
traits
of
extreme
orderliness
and
tidiness
cleverness
even
for
here
you
see
is
a
place
where
a
bit
of
the
plaster
has
been
defaced
by
a
knock
or
scratch
and
it
has
been
delicately
painted
over
with
a
little
pale
green
paint
which
matches
exactly
it
is
not
the
work
of
a
professional
decorator
so
reason
tells
me
that
probably
miss
van
allen
herself
remedied
the
defect
good
gracious
exclaimed
winnie
i
can
see
all
that
myself
now
you
tell
me
but
i
never
should
have
thought
of
it
tell
me
more
then
the
pictures
which
are
so
well
chosen
and
placed
that
they
seem
part
of
the
walls
are
as
you
notice
all
figure
pieces
there
are
no
landscapes
this
of
course
means
that
miss
van
allen
is
not
distinctly
a
nature
lover
but
prefers
humanity
and
society
this
argues
for
the
joy
of
living
and
the
appreciation
of
mental
pleasures
and
occupations
no
devotee
of
nature
would
have
failed
to
have
pictures
of
flowers
or
harmonizing
landscapes
on
these
walls
so
you
see
to
be
edified
by
the
tongues
of
walls
you
must
not
only
listen
to
them
but
understand
their
language
and
then
stone
began
taking
in
the
rest
of
the
contents
the
table
hastily
cleared
by
the
caterer
men
was
empty
of
the
china
and
glass
which
they
had
supplied
but
still
retained
the
candlesticks
and
epergnes
that
were
vicky
van
own
these
were
of
plated
silver
not
sterling
which
fact
stone
noted
the
linen
however
was
of
the
finest
and
most
elaborate
sort
an
unholy
waste
of
money
declared
rhoda
schuyler
looking
at
the
marvellous
monogram
of
embroidered
on
the
napkins
but
i
gazed
sadly
at
the
table
only
partially
dismantled
which
had
been
so
gaily
decked
for
vicky
birthday
supper
scanning
the
sideboard
stone
remarked
the
absence
of
the
small
carving
knife
i
told
him
i
too
had
observed
that
and
that
i
had
made
search
for
it
did
you
ask
the
caterer
people
if
they
took
it
by
mistake
said
the
detective
no
i
admitted
ashamed
that
i
had
thought
of
it
and
i
promised
to
do
so
as
stone
stood
silently
contemplating
the
place
where
randolph
schuyler
had
met
his
death
i
stepped
out
into
the
hall
i
had
no
conscious
reason
for
doing
so
but
i
did
and
chancing
to
glance
toward
the
stairs
i
with
difficulty
repressed
an
exclamation
for
up
the
staircase
i
saw
vicky
van
i
was
sure
it
was
no
hallucination
i
positively
saw
her
she
was
leaning
over
the
banister
listening
to
what
stone
was
saying
suddenly
even
as
i
looked
she
ran
upstairs
and
disappeared
was
she
safe
could
she
escape
perhaps
by
a
back
staircase
or
could
she
manage
to
elude
us
and
slip
away
somehow
then
i
was
was
i
conniving
at
the
escape
of
a
guilty
person
did
i
want
to
do
this
i
did
know
something
told
me
i
must
tell
stone
of
her
presence
and
yet
something
else
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
so
i
turned
back
to
the
and
miss
sarah
was
saying
the
spot
then
that
where
randolph
was
killed
by
that
awful
woman
stone
you
get
her
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
life
for
a
life
she
must
pay
the
penalty
of
her
guilt
winnie
was
listening
and
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
like
ruth
schuyler
from
whom
she
doubtless
took
a
cue
win
was
so
ready
to
condemn
vicky
van
unheard
as
the
two
sisters
were
she
looked
steadily
at
fleming
stone
as
if
expecting
him
to
produce
vicky
then
and
there
and
i
quivered
with
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
if
he
knew
that
even
at
that
moment
vicky
was
under
the
same
roof
with
ourselves
but
stone
completed
his
survey
of
the
and
as
a
matter
of
course
started
next
up
the
stairs
i
pushed
ahead
a
little
in
my
eagerness
to
precede
him
but
a
vague
desire
to
protect
vicky
urged
me
on
i
stood
in
the
upper
hall
as
the
rest
came
up
and
i
imagined
that
stone
gave
me
a
curious
glance
as
he
noted
my
evident
embarrassment
but
winnie
dashed
into
the
music
room
and
the
schuyler
sisters
quickly
followed
trust
a
woman
to
feel
and
show
curiosity
about
her
neighbor
home
again
stone
examined
the
walls
but
the
immaculate
white
and
gold
sides
of
the
music
room
said
nothing
intelligible
to
me
and
if
they
spoke
to
him
he
did
not
divulge
the
message
the
women
exclaimed
at
the
beautiful
room
and
as
stone
examination
here
was
short
we
all
filed
back
to
vicky
bedroom
i
heard
no
sound
of
her
and
i
breathed
more
freely
as
we
did
not
find
her
in
bedroom
or
in
the
boudoir
beyond
she
had
then
succeeded
in
getting
away
and
trusted
to
me
not
to
betray
her
presence
there
the
boudoir
or
all
pink
satin
and
white
enameled
wicker
called
forth
new
exclamations
from
winnie
and
even
rhoda
schuyler
expressed
a
grudging
admiration
it
beautiful
she
conceded
i
wish
ruth
had
come
after
all
she
loves
this
sort
of
furniture
do
you
remember
sarah
she
wanted
randolph
to
do
up
her
in
wicker
yes
but
he
did
like
it
he
said
it
was
and
the
circassian
walnut
of
ruth
room
is
much
handsomer
of
course
it
is
ruth
has
a
charming
suite
oh
do
look
at
the
dresses
fleming
stone
had
flung
open
a
wardrobe
door
and
the
costumes
disclosed
though
not
numerous
were
of
beautiful
coloring
and
design
winnie
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
fingered
them
lovingly
and
called
my
attention
to
certain
wonderful
confections
what
did
she
wear
the
night
of
the
crime
stone
asked
and
i
told
him
having
win
for
a
sister
i
am
fairly
good
at
describing
clothes
and
i
drew
a
vivid
word
picture
of
vicky
gold
fringed
gown
heavenly
exclaimed
winnie
although
she
had
had
me
describe
the
gown
to
her
on
the
average
of
twice
a
day
for
a
week
i
wish
i
could
see
it
some
day
chet
i
going
to
have
one
like
it
fringe
said
stone
curiously
do
women
wear
fringe
nowadays
oh
yes
i
responded
but
it
was
a
long
fringe
of
gilt
beads
that
really
formed
an
overdress
to
the
tulle
skirt
stay
i
a
piece
of
it
and
i
took
out
my
pocketbook
see
here
it
is
i
found
it
caught
in
those
gilded
leaves
at
the
lower
corner
of
the
mirror
frame
that
long
they
all
looked
at
the
mirror
which
hung
flat
against
the
wall
its
foliated
florentine
frame
full
of
irregular
protuberances
of
course
said
winnie
nodding
her
head
i
know
just
how
she
stood
in
front
of
it
whirling
around
to
see
her
gown
from
all
sides
like
this
win
whirled
herself
around
before
the
glass
and
succeeded
in
catching
a
bit
of
her
own
full
skirt
on
the
frame
you
little
goose
i
cried
as
the
fabric
tore
we
do
need
a
demonstration
at
the
expense
of
your
frock
fleming
stone
was
studying
the
strand
of
gold
fringe
it
was
composed
of
tiny
beads
of
varying
shapes
and
had
already
begun
to
ravel
into
shreds
i
keep
this
he
said
and
i
lost
my
little
souvenir
of
vicky
van
but
of
course
if
he
considered
it
evidence
i
had
to
give
it
up
and
the
fact
of
doing
so
partly
salved
my
conscience
of
its
guilty
feeling
at
concealing
the
fact
of
vicky
presence
in
her
own
house
just
then
and
too
i
said
to
myself
stone
is
out
to
find
her
surely
a
detective
of
his
calibre
can
accomplish
that
without
help
of
an
humble
layman
so
i
kept
my
own
counsel
and
further
search
of
the
next
story
and
later
of
the
basement
rooms
gave
no
hint
of
presence
or
departure
indeed
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
had
really
seen
her
could
she
have
been
so
clearly
in
my
mind
that
i
visualized
her
in
a
moment
of
clairvoyance
my
reason
rebelled
at
this
for
i
knew
i
saw
her
as
well
as
i
knew
i
was
alive
she
had
on
the
same
little
hat
in
which
i
had
last
seen
her
she
had
on
no
cloak
and
her
street
dress
was
of
a
dark
cloth
i
could
be
sure
how
she
got
away
for
the
basement
door
we
found
bolted
on
the
inside
but
she
must
have
warily
evaded
and
eluded
us
and
slipped
here
and
there
as
we
pursued
our
course
through
the
house
and
then
have
gone
out
by
the
front
door
when
we
were
say
on
the
upper
floors
returning
to
vicky
boudoir
where
her
little
was
fleming
stone
began
to
run
over
the
letters
and
papers
therein
it
was
locked
but
he
picked
the
flimsy
fastening
and
calmly
took
up
the
task
with
his
usual
efficient
manner
i
stayed
with
him
and
the
three
women
wandered
back
over
the
house
again
he
ran
through
letters
with
glancing
quickness
flipped
over
sheafs
of
bills
and
examined
pens
ink
and
paper
there
so
much
that
characteristic
about
a
desk
he
said
as
he
observed
the
penwiper
stamps
and
especially
the
pencils
indeed
i
feel
now
that
i
know
miss
van
allen
as
well
if
not
better
than
you
do
yourself
mr
calhoun
in
that
case
then
you
ca
believe
her
guilty
i
flashed
back
for
the
very
atmosphere
of
the
dear
little
room
made
me
more
than
ever
vicky
friend
but
you
see
and
he
spoke
a
bit
sadly
what
i
know
of
her
is
the
real
woman
i
ca
be
deceived
by
her
wiles
and
coquetries
i
see
only
the
actual
traces
of
her
actual
self
i
knew
what
he
meant
and
there
was
some
truth
in
it
for
vicky
was
a
mystery
and
i
was
not
by
any
means
sure
that
she
did
hoodwink
us
when
she
chose
to
much
as
i
liked
and
admired
the
girl
i
was
forced
to
believe
she
was
not
altogether
disingenuous
and
she
was
clever
enough
to
hoodwink
anybody
but
if
stone
deductions
were
to
be
depended
on
they
were
doubtless
true
evidence
is
she
guilty
i
sighed
i
ca
say
that
yet
but
i
found
nothing
that
absolutely
precludes
her
guilt
on
the
contrary
i
found
things
which
if
she
is
guilty
will
go
far
toward
proving
it
this
sounded
a
bit
enigmatical
but
stone
was
so
serious
that
i
grasped
his
general
meaning
and
let
it
go
at
that
i
mean
he
said
divining
my
thoughts
that
things
may
or
may
not
be
evidence
according
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
suspect
if
you
find
a
little
boy
in
the
pantry
beside
an
empty
jampot
you
suspect
him
of
stealing
jam
now
if
lots
of
other
circumstances
prove
that
child
did
take
the
jam
the
empty
pot
is
evidence
but
if
circumstances
develop
that
convince
you
the
child
did
not
have
any
jam
whatever
that
day
then
the
jampot
is
no
evidence
at
all
and
you
have
found
empty
jampots
i
asked
i
have
but
so
far
i
not
sure
that
they
are
condemnatory
evidence
though
in
justice
to
my
own
work
i
must
add
that
they
have
every
appearance
of
being
so
you
already
like
vicky
van
then
i
said
quickly
moved
to
do
so
by
a
certain
note
of
regret
in
his
voice
no
man
could
help
liking
a
woman
who
possesses
her
traits
she
has
delightful
taste
and
tastes
she
is
most
charitable
her
accounts
show
sums
wisely
expended
on
worthy
charities
and
letters
from
friends
prove
her
a
truly
loyal
and
lovable
character
such
a
girl
kill
a
man
i
broke
out
do
say
that
there
is
no
one
incapable
of
crime
but
such
a
nature
would
require
very
strong
provocation
and
desperate
conditions
these
granted
it
is
by
no
means
impossible
now
i
am
through
for
but
if
you
please
i
will
keep
the
key
of
the
house
as
the
case
is
now
in
my
hands
you
will
not
object
no
i
said
a
little
reluctantly
for
suppose
vicky
should
give
me
another
commission
or
ask
me
to
perform
another
errand
in
the
house
you
have
a
transparent
face
calhoun
and
fleming
stone
smiled
quizzically
why
do
you
want
to
keep
the
key
my
aunt
is
most
desirous
of
seeing
this
house
i
deliberately
prevaricated
and
i
thought
but
i
did
deceive
the
astute
detective
no
that
is
it
he
said
quietly
i
not
sure
but
i
think
you
are
in
touch
with
miss
van
allen
and
if
i
am
i
flared
up
very
well
he
returned
it
is
as
you
imply
none
of
my
business
but
i
want
to
know
your
attitude
and
if
it
is
antagonistic
to
my
work
i
am
sorry
but
i
will
conduct
my
course
accordingly
stone
i
confessed
i
am
not
antagonistic
but
i
do
know
a
little
about
miss
van
allen
movements
that
i
have
told
i
can
not
see
that
it
would
assist
you
in
any
way
to
know
it
that
enough
and
fleming
stone
spoke
heartily
your
assurance
of
that
is
sufficient
now
are
we
working
together
i
hesitated
then
i
suddenly
thought
of
ruth
schuyler
i
owed
her
a
business
fealty
and
somehow
i
liked
to
feel
that
i
also
owed
her
a
personal
allegiance
and
both
these
demanded
my
efforts
to
avenge
the
death
of
her
husband
irrespective
of
where
the
blow
might
fall
so
i
said
honestly
we
are
stone
i
will
help
you
if
i
can
and
if
at
any
time
i
think
my
withheld
information
will
help
you
i
will
make
it
known
is
that
satisfactory
entirely
so
and
the
handshake
that
stone
gave
me
was
like
a
signed
and
sealed
bond
to
which
i
tacitly
but
none
the
less
truthfully
subscribed
chapter
xv
fibsy
next
morning
as
i
started
for
my
office
i
found
myself
combating
a
strong
impulse
to
call
in
at
ruth
schuyler
i
had
no
errand
there
and
i
knew
that
if
she
required
my
services
she
would
summon
me
it
was
no
longer
incumbent
on
me
to
try
to
unravel
the
murder
mystery
fleming
stone
had
that
matter
in
charge
and
his
needed
no
assistance
from
me
and
yet
i
wanted
to
stop
at
the
fifth
avenue
house
if
only
for
a
moment
to
reassure
myself
of
ruth
though
above
me
in
social
rank
the
little
widow
seemed
to
me
a
lonely
and
pathetic
woman
and
i
knew
she
had
begun
to
depend
on
me
for
advice
and
sympathy
of
course
she
could
turn
to
fleming
stone
but
in
a
way
he
was
adviser
of
the
schuyler
sisters
and
i
knew
ruth
hesitated
to
intrude
on
his
time
i
was
still
uncertain
whether
to
call
or
not
and
as
i
walked
along
the
few
feet
between
my
own
house
and
the
avenue
i
crossed
the
street
as
i
reached
vicky
van
house
and
naturally
looked
at
it
as
i
passed
and
after
i
had
passed
the
flight
of
brownstone
steps
and
was
going
along
by
the
iron
fence
i
turned
to
look
at
the
area
door
this
was
my
performance
every
morning
and
always
without
thought
of
seeing
anything
of
importance
but
this
time
the
area
door
stood
open
and
looking
out
was
a
boy
a
chap
with
a
freckled
face
and
bright
wise
eyes
i
turned
quickly
and
went
in
at
the
area
gate
who
are
you
i
demanded
and
what
are
you
doing
here
i
fibsy
he
said
as
if
that
settled
it
fibsy
who
i
asked
but
i
dropped
my
indignant
tone
for
the
lad
seemed
to
be
composedly
sure
of
his
rights
there
aw
jest
fibsy
that
me
name
because
if
you
want
to
know
because
i
a
natural
born
liar
and
i
fib
for
a
living
he
was
impudent
without
being
offensive
his
wide
smile
was
and
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
a
friendly
one
i
got
yer
number
he
said
after
a
comprehensive
survey
of
my
person
you
calhoun
ai
you
i
sure
am
i
agreed
meeting
his
taste
for
the
vernacular
and
now
for
your
real
name
terence
mcguire
he
smiled
and
with
a
quick
gesture
he
snatched
off
his
cap
in
if
you
like
i
stone
man
what
i
cried
in
amazement
yep
that
what
i
well
i
like
to
call
myself
his
caddy
i
follow
him
round
and
hold
his
clues
for
him
till
he
wants
one
then
i
hand
it
out
see
not
entirely
but
i
gather
you
in
stone
employ
you
bet
i
am
and
i
on
me
job
hours
a
day
and
what
is
your
job
just
now
well
since
eight
i
been
holdin
up
this
door
waitin
for
yer
honor
to
pass
by
an
i
got
you
did
i
yes
i
here
i
stepped
inside
and
the
boy
closed
the
door
we
went
into
the
front
basement
room
where
there
was
a
lighted
gas
stove
i
camp
here
o
the
heats
there
no
use
gettin
up
the
steam
fer
the
few
casual
callers
that
drops
in
at
present
now
calhoun
i
do
want
to
be
stuffy
nor
nuthin
but
stone
said
i
might
ask
you
some
few
things
if
i
liked
an
you
can
answer
or
not
as
you
like
this
ai
no
orficial
investigation
but
i
you
as
intrusted
as
anybody
in
findin
this
here
victoria
van
allen
i
interested
in
finding
the
murderer
of
schuyler
i
replied
an
maybe
they
ai
one
an
the
same
that
so
he
spoke
thoughtfully
and
scanned
my
face
with
a
quizzical
glance
but
of
course
stone
find
out
now
calhoun
if
you
do
mind
will
you
give
me
a
line
on
that
maid
person
that
julia
julie
she
is
called
all
right
julie
goes
is
she
a
young
thing
no
just
this
side
of
probably
or
so
good
looker
why
about
average
brown
hair
brownish
eyes
really
i
never
noticed
her
closely
enough
to
think
about
her
appearance
she
is
sure
a
good
servant
and
devoted
to
miss
van
allen
but
do
you
know
anything
special
anything
that
would
pick
her
out
from
a
lot
of
other
good
servants
in
appearance
you
mean
yes
i
ca
think
of
anything
let
me
see
she
wears
glasses
what
sort
i
do
know
just
ordinary
glasses
i
guess
spectacles
or
i
not
sure
spectacles
i
think
and
she
has
a
great
many
teeth
front
ones
yes
that
is
they
very
noticeable
when
she
speaks
to
you
well
that
sumpum
is
she
quick
and
or
poky
i
smiled
at
the
boy
eagerness
she
rather
alert
i
said
but
of
course
quiet
and
respectful
i
never
looked
at
her
with
any
personal
interest
so
i
can
only
give
you
my
general
impressions
you
see
it
this
way
and
the
boy
looked
very
serious
wherever
miss
van
allen
is
that
julie
there
too
and
when
miss
van
allen
wants
errands
done
of
course
she
sends
julie
and
of
course
said
julie
is
disguised
i
dope
out
all
this
has
to
be
so
for
miss
van
allen
has
mailed
letters
and
oh
well
of
course
she
could
mail
letters
in
lots
of
ways
but
sumpum
tells
me
that
she
depends
on
miss
julie
as
an
errand
girl
so
i
want
to
find
out
the
look
of
the
julie
person
and
see
if
i
ca
track
her
down
and
so
get
at
miss
van
allen
vicky
van
i
believe
her
friends
call
her
they
do
said
i
looking
sternly
at
the
boy
and
i
say
right
here
that
i
one
of
her
friends
and
i
wo
stand
for
any
impertinence
or
any
remarks
of
any
sort
about
that
lady
if
she
is
suspected
of
this
crime
let
the
law
take
its
course
but
until
there
is
some
direct
evidence
do
you
dare
to
connect
her
name
with
it
i
only
obeying
stone
orders
and
take
it
from
me
calhoun
i
ai
so
fresh
as
to
make
remarks
about
a
lady
i
a
prevaricator
of
the
truth
but
only
when
it
abserlutely
necessary
and
on
the
other
hand
i
a
born
protector
of
women
why
i
be
only
too
tickled
to
find
a
gentleman
suspect
or
at
least
to
clear
miss
van
allen
from
all
why
do
you
feel
such
a
kindly
interest
in
the
lady
this
house
for
one
reason
you
see
i
been
all
over
it
at
stone
orders
and
i
what
a
nice
lady
she
is
i
do
have
to
see
her
to
understand
her
tastes
and
her
why
jest
the
books
on
her
centre
tables
and
the
records
for
her
phonograph
spell
her
out
for
me
in
words
of
one
syllable
and
though
hunting
for
her
it
is
with
a
solid
hunch
that
she
the
not
by
no
means
but
find
her
i
gotto
because
stone
says
for
me
to
i
looked
at
the
boy
more
curiously
he
was
a
strange
admixture
of
street
boy
and
sleuth
his
quick
darting
eyes
were
never
still
but
warily
alert
to
catch
the
meaning
of
any
sound
or
motion
on
my
part
i
felt
as
if
he
read
me
through
and
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
have
him
tell
me
he
knew
of
my
recent
communications
with
vicky
but
i
only
said
you
are
then
stone
man
i
put
it
that
way
yes
but
really
i
his
apprentice
and
learning
his
trade
i
study
his
methods
and
i
add
some
gumption
of
my
own
and
if
i
can
help
him
i
glad
and
happy
and
anyway
learning
and
this
talk
about
your
lying
is
that
straight
goods
if
it
is
how
can
you
believe
what
i
tell
you
he
asked
whimsically
but
i
used
to
be
a
fierce
liar
then
gettin
in
with
stone
made
me
see
it
wrong
to
lie
usuerly
that
is
so
i
do
now
leastways
not
much
only
when
it
jest
the
only
thing
to
do
to
save
game
how
does
stone
know
when
you
telling
the
truth
then
good
land
i
do
lie
to
him
i
would
and
if
i
did
it
be
any
use
he
see
through
me
scat
but
honest
i
would
you
see
he
my
idol
yes
sir
my
idol
that
what
that
man
is
well
calhoun
as
you
told
me
all
you
can
pry
loose
from
your
stock
of
infermation
you
an
me
may
as
well
make
our
adooses
how
do
you
know
i
have
revealed
all
i
know
of
the
case
oh
i
read
from
your
mobile
counternance
that
you
keepin
sumpum
back
but
it
do
matter
stone
nail
it
when
he
gets
good
ready
what
i
wanted
from
you
was
mostly
the
speakin
likeness
of
the
julie
dame
an
i
guess
i
got
it
oh
say
one
other
thing
who
among
miss
van
allen
friends
is
an
artist
miss
gale
is
one
miss
ariadne
gale
thank
you
sir
and
will
you
gim
me
her
address
i
did
so
and
then
i
went
away
thinking
fleming
stone
a
queer
sort
of
detective
to
have
for
assistant
such
an
illiterate
uncultured
boy
as
fibsy
the
name
was
enough
to
condemn
him
but
as
i
thought
the
little
chap
over
i
realized
that
his
talk
had
been
and
to
the
point
besides
showing
sagacity
and
perspicacity
it
was
growing
late
but
after
this
interview
i
felt
i
must
see
ruth
for
a
few
minutes
so
called
at
the
schuyler
house
she
greeted
me
cordially
and
seemed
glad
to
see
me
winnie
was
still
acting
as
secretary
for
her
but
the
rush
of
notes
of
condolence
was
over
and
as
ruth
was
not
of
course
giving
or
accepting
social
invitations
there
was
not
so
much
work
for
win
as
at
first
but
the
two
had
become
fast
friends
and
winnie
told
me
how
they
sat
together
chatting
often
for
pleasant
half
hours
at
a
time
i
told
ruth
about
the
strange
boy
at
vicky
van
house
yes
she
said
i
heard
about
him
stone
picked
him
up
somewhere
and
he
uses
him
as
a
sort
of
outside
scout
he
has
all
confidence
in
him
though
i
believe
the
little
chap
rejoices
in
the
name
of
fibber
fibsy
i
corrected
he
is
certainly
a
bright
youth
and
he
plans
to
hunt
down
miss
van
allen
by
means
of
her
maid
julie
are
they
together
we
only
suppose
so
it
seems
probable
that
miss
van
allen
would
want
the
help
if
not
the
protection
of
her
servant
julie
is
a
most
capable
woman
and
devoted
to
her
mistress
i
heard
so
i
have
a
kind
thoughtful
woman
too
and
i
should
miss
her
terribly
were
i
without
her
oh
but
your
tibbetts
is
a
servant
and
nothing
more
this
julie
was
a
real
friend
to
miss
van
allen
and
looked
after
her
in
every
way
housekeeper
maid
nurse
and
general
bodyguard
yes
miss
van
allen
must
have
needed
such
a
person
since
as
i
am
told
she
lived
alone
my
are
quite
in
love
with
the
van
allen
house
both
they
and
winnie
have
been
singing
its
praises
this
morning
it
seems
your
vicky
van
is
a
lady
of
most
refined
tastes
she
certainly
is
i
ca
help
thinking
if
you
and
she
had
known
each
other
in
favorable
circumstances
you
would
have
been
friends
it
may
be
i
have
never
felt
sure
that
she
is
the
guilty
one
but
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
not
wanting
her
to
be
found
i
do
want
that
she
should
be
schuyler
sisters
have
shown
me
that
to
hesitate
at
or
neglect
any
means
of
hunting
her
out
would
be
wrong
and
so
i
am
glad
we
have
stone
and
i
hope
he
will
succeed
in
his
search
what
changed
your
mind
especially
i
realized
that
it
would
be
disloyalty
to
my
husband
memory
to
let
his
possible
slayer
go
free
the
girl
must
be
found
and
then
if
she
can
be
freed
of
suspicion
very
well
but
the
case
must
be
investigated
fully
i
dare
say
you
are
right
schuyler
was
a
man
of
importance
and
influence
and
aside
from
that
every
deed
of
blood
calls
for
revenge
i
honor
you
for
deciding
as
you
have
it
is
justice
that
moves
me
more
than
my
personal
inclination
ruth
went
on
i
will
not
deny
calhoun
that
in
some
ways
my
husband
death
has
freed
me
from
certain
restrictions
that
hampered
and
galled
me
i
should
mention
this
to
you
but
i
know
the
sisters
have
told
you
that
i
have
in
many
ways
gone
counter
to
schuyler
wishes
since
i
have
been
my
own
mistress
it
is
true
he
and
i
disagreed
greatly
on
matters
of
the
household
and
matters
of
my
personal
comfort
and
convenience
now
that
i
can
do
so
i
am
arranging
my
life
differently
it
is
natural
that
i
should
do
this
but
the
schuyler
ladies
think
that
i
have
begun
indecently
soon
i
say
this
not
by
way
of
apology
but
because
i
want
you
to
understand
ruth
looked
very
sweet
and
wistful
as
she
seemed
to
make
a
bid
for
my
sympathy
i
was
impressed
anew
by
the
soft
pallor
of
her
face
and
the
sweet
purity
of
her
gray
eyes
i
contrasted
her
with
vicky
van
one
the
embodiment
of
life
and
gayety
the
other
a
gentle
dovelike
personality
which
however
hinted
sometimes
at
hidden
fires
i
believed
that
ruth
schuyler
had
been
so
repressed
so
dominated
by
her
brute
of
a
husband
that
her
nature
had
never
expanded
to
its
own
possibilities
and
like
a
blinding
flash
of
lightning
the
knowledge
came
to
me
that
i
loved
her
it
was
no
uncertain
conviction
the
fact
sprang
to
my
brain
and
my
heart
swelled
with
the
bliss
of
it
i
scarcely
dared
look
at
her
i
could
tell
her
yet
i
had
no
reason
to
think
she
cared
for
me
other
than
as
the
merest
acquaintance
yet
then
and
there
i
vowed
to
myself
that
she
should
care
i
thought
of
vicky
van
poor
little
vicky
she
had
interested
me
did
interest
me
but
in
only
a
friendly
way
indeed
my
interest
in
her
was
prompted
by
sympathy
for
her
luckless
position
and
the
trust
she
had
reposed
in
me
i
would
hold
her
trust
sacred
i
would
never
play
false
to
vicky
van
but
henceforth
and
forever
my
heart
and
soul
belonged
to
my
liege
lady
my
ruth
what
is
the
matter
mr
calhoun
i
heard
her
saying
and
i
looked
up
to
see
her
smiling
almost
gayly
at
me
your
thoughts
seem
to
be
a
thousand
miles
away
oh
not
so
far
as
that
i
protested
somehow
i
felt
buoyantly
happy
i
had
no
wish
to
tell
her
of
my
love
at
present
i
was
quite
content
to
worship
her
in
secret
and
i
exulted
in
a
sort
of
clairvoyant
knowledge
that
i
should
yet
win
her
i
smiled
into
her
dear
eyes
as
i
continued
they
were
really
round
the
corner
in
vicky
van
house
to
my
delight
she
pouted
a
little
let
talk
of
something
else
she
said
i
no
doubt
miss
van
allen
is
charming
and
her
home
a
perfect
gem
but
i
own
up
i
not
anxious
to
discuss
her
all
the
time
and
with
every
one
you
shall
be
exempt
from
it
with
me
i
promised
henceforth
her
name
is
taboo
between
us
and
you
shall
choose
our
subjects
yourself
then
let
talk
about
me
now
you
know
calhoun
i
never
see
bradbury
so
you
must
be
my
legal
adviser
in
all
my
quandaries
first
and
this
is
a
serious
matter
i
do
want
to
continue
to
live
with
the
schuyler
ladies
we
are
diametrically
opposed
on
all
matters
of
opinion
and
disagree
on
many
matters
of
fact
ruth
smiled
and
i
marveled
afresh
at
the
way
her
face
lighted
up
when
she
indulged
in
that
little
smile
of
hers
nor
she
went
on
do
they
want
to
live
with
me
so
it
ought
to
be
an
easy
matter
to
please
us
all
as
to
the
house
and
furnishings
they
are
all
mine
but
if
the
sisters
prefer
to
live
here
and
let
me
go
elsewhere
i
am
willing
to
give
them
the
house
and
its
contents
i
know
you
do
care
for
this
type
of
residence
i
said
indeed
miss
schuyler
said
yesterday
as
we
looked
over
vicky
van
house
that
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
you
liked
oh
i
ca
think
i
would
like
her
house
i
supposed
it
was
a
plain
little
affair
harmonious
and
pretty
winnie
says
but
she
did
give
me
the
impression
it
was
elaborate
no
it
is
and
it
would
be
as
grand
as
your
home
ought
to
be
but
mention
of
the
girl
is
not
allowed
i
believe
she
smiled
again
and
resumed
well
i
want
you
to
sound
the
schuyler
sisters
and
find
out
their
wishes
when
i
speak
to
them
they
only
say
for
me
to
wait
until
after
the
mystery
is
solved
and
all
this
horrid
publicity
and
notoriety
at
an
end
but
i
want
to
go
away
from
them
now
i
want
stone
to
do
his
work
and
i
hope
he
will
find
that
girl
and
all
that
but
i
ca
stand
it
to
live
in
this
atmosphere
of
detectives
and
reporters
and
policemen
any
longer
than
i
must
would
it
do
for
me
to
go
to
some
quiet
hotel
for
a
while
i
could
take
tibbetts
and
just
be
quietly
by
myself
while
the
schuylers
continue
to
live
in
this
house
i
thought
it
over
i
understood
perfectly
how
she
hated
to
be
questioned
continually
as
to
her
life
with
her
late
husband
for
i
was
beginning
to
realize
that
that
life
had
been
a
continuous
tragedy
nothing
much
definite
but
many
sidelights
and
stray
hints
had
shown
me
how
he
had
treated
her
and
how
patiently
she
had
borne
it
and
now
he
was
gone
and
i
for
one
did
blame
her
that
she
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
scenes
of
her
slavery
to
him
for
it
had
been
that
he
had
enforced
his
ideas
and
opinions
upon
her
until
she
had
been
allowed
to
do
nothing
and
to
have
nothing
as
she
wished
and
now
she
desired
only
peace
and
quietness
somewhere
anywhere
away
from
the
two
who
represented
randolph
schuyler
tyranny
and
carping
criticism
without
his
right
to
obtrude
them
on
her
i
will
speak
to
them
i
said
and
i
sure
we
can
arrange
some
mode
of
life
for
you
which
will
give
you
rest
and
freedom
of
judgment
oh
if
you
only
can
she
murmured
as
she
held
out
a
friendly
hand
chapter
xvi
a
futile
chase
it
was
sunday
afternoon
and
we
were
in
conclave
in
the
schuyler
library
fleming
stone
was
summing
up
his
results
of
the
past
few
days
and
though
it
was
evident
he
had
done
all
that
mortal
man
could
do
yet
he
had
no
hint
or
clue
as
to
where
vicky
van
might
be
and
he
held
that
nothing
else
was
of
consequence
compared
to
this
knowledge
she
must
be
found
and
whether
that
could
be
done
quickly
by
search
or
by
chance
or
whether
it
would
take
a
long
time
of
waiting
he
could
not
say
he
felt
sure
that
she
must
disclose
herself
sooner
or
later
but
if
not
and
if
their
search
continued
unavailing
then
he
held
out
no
hope
for
success
it
a
unique
case
he
said
in
my
experience
all
depends
on
finding
that
woman
if
she
is
innocent
herself
she
knows
who
did
it
and
if
she
is
the
guilty
one
she
is
clever
enough
to
remain
hidden
it
may
be
she
is
miles
away
out
of
the
country
perhaps
she
has
had
ample
time
to
make
arrangements
to
go
abroad
or
to
any
distant
place
her
guilt
seems
to
me
probable
because
she
has
literally
abandoned
her
house
and
her
belongings
an
innocent
woman
would
scarcely
leave
all
those
modern
and
valuable
furnishings
unless
for
some
very
strong
reason
but
as
to
finding
her
a
needle
in
a
haystack
presents
an
easy
problem
by
contrast
doubtless
she
is
hiding
in
the
house
of
some
friend
suggested
ruth
thoughtfully
it
seems
to
me
she
must
have
been
taken
in
and
cared
for
by
some
one
who
loved
her
that
night
she
disappeared
i
think
so
too
agreed
stone
but
i
been
to
see
all
her
friends
that
i
can
find
out
about
i
called
on
a
score
of
them
finding
their
addresses
in
her
address
book
that
lowney
gave
me
of
course
they
may
have
been
deceiving
me
but
i
feel
safe
in
asserting
that
she
is
not
under
the
protection
of
any
one
i
interviewed
she
returned
to
her
house
last
monday
night
the
police
believe
for
the
purpose
of
getting
her
mail
this
shows
a
daring
almost
unbelievable
that
mail
must
have
been
of
desperate
importance
to
her
she
has
not
been
to
the
house
since
they
feel
sure
and
since
i
have
been
on
the
case
she
could
not
have
entered
for
i
have
kept
it
under
strict
surveillance
i
think
she
will
never
return
to
it
presumably
she
got
the
letters
she
was
so
anxious
for
her
mail
that
has
arrived
the
last
few
days
i
have
not
opened
but
the
envelopes
show
mostly
tradesmen
cards
or
are
indubitably
social
correspondence
there
seem
to
be
no
letters
from
lawyers
or
financial
firms
however
if
nothing
develops
i
shall
open
the
letters
this
case
being
unprecedented
necessitates
unusual
proceedings
i
disappointed
in
you
stone
said
rhoda
schuyler
testily
i
did
suppose
you
were
superhuman
but
i
did
think
with
your
reputation
and
all
you
would
be
able
to
find
that
woman
i
heard
say
that
nobody
could
absolutely
vanish
in
new
york
city
and
not
be
traced
you
do
regret
my
failure
a
bit
more
than
i
do
miss
schuyler
but
i
feel
no
shame
or
embarrassment
over
it
nor
am
i
ready
to
admit
myself
beaten
i
have
a
theory
or
rather
a
conviction
that
there
is
one
and
only
one
explanation
of
this
strange
affair
i
am
not
quite
ready
to
expound
this
but
in
a
day
or
two
i
shall
find
if
it
is
the
true
solution
and
if
so
i
shall
soon
find
miss
van
allen
i
knew
you
would
and
sarah
schuyler
nodded
her
head
in
satisfaction
i
told
rhoda
to
give
you
more
time
and
you
would
not
disappoint
us
all
right
stone
use
all
the
time
you
need
but
no
schuyler
must
remain
unavenged
i
want
to
see
that
woman
killed
yes
killed
for
her
murder
of
my
brother
sarah
schuyler
looked
like
a
figure
of
justice
herself
as
with
flashing
eyes
she
declared
her
wrath
and
it
was
her
right
her
brother
blood
called
out
for
vengeance
but
the
more
ruth
shuddered
and
shrank
from
this
stern
arraignment
oh
sarah
she
murmured
not
killed
do
condemn
a
woman
to
that
why
not
ruth
if
a
woman
can
kill
a
woman
should
be
killed
but
she
wo
be
she
added
bitterly
no
jury
ever
convicts
a
woman
no
matter
how
clearly
her
guilt
is
proven
just
then
fibsy
appeared
he
was
a
strange
little
figure
and
showed
a
shy
awkwardness
at
the
grandeur
of
his
surroundings
he
bobbed
a
funny
little
curtsy
to
ruth
whom
he
already
adored
and
with
an
embarrassed
nod
included
the
rest
of
us
in
a
general
greeting
then
to
fleming
stone
he
said
in
an
eager
triumphant
tone
i
got
got
what
asked
ruth
smiling
at
him
got
pictures
of
miss
van
allen
and
julie
too
what
cried
ruth
interested
at
once
let
me
see
them
fibsy
glanced
at
her
and
then
at
stone
and
handed
a
parcel
to
the
latter
he
my
boss
the
boy
said
as
if
by
way
of
apology
for
slighting
her
request
fleming
stone
opened
the
parcel
and
showed
two
sketches
miss
gale
made
them
he
explained
i
sent
fibsy
over
there
to
induce
her
to
give
us
at
least
a
hint
of
miss
van
allen
personal
appearance
the
boy
could
wheedle
it
from
her
when
i
could
see
he
handed
the
pictures
to
miss
rhoda
for
he
too
respected
authority
but
we
all
gathered
round
to
look
they
were
the
merest
sketches
a
wash
of
but
they
showed
merit
as
the
only
one
present
who
knew
vicky
van
i
was
asked
of
the
truth
of
their
portraiture
fairly
good
i
said
yes
more
than
that
this
of
vicky
shows
the
coloring
of
her
face
and
hair
and
the
general
effect
of
her
costume
more
than
her
actual
physiognomy
but
it
is
certainly
a
close
enough
likeness
to
make
her
recognizable
if
you
find
her
and
this
was
true
ariadne
had
caught
the
sidelong
glance
of
vicky
van
eyes
and
the
curve
of
her
scarlet
lips
the
coloring
was
perfect
just
vicky
vivid
tints
and
the
dark
hair
looped
over
her
ears
was
as
she
always
wore
it
ariadne
had
drawn
her
in
the
gown
she
had
worn
that
fatal
evening
and
the
women
eagerly
scrutinized
the
gorgeous
costume
no
wonder
those
long
strands
of
fringe
caught
in
that
scraggly
mirror
frame
exclaimed
winnie
who
never
missed
a
point
right
said
stone
if
she
whirled
around
as
you
did
miss
calhoun
it
a
wonder
she
did
spoil
her
whole
gown
the
pose
and
the
figure
were
not
exactly
vicky
ariadne
was
much
on
catching
a
likeness
or
a
physical
effect
but
the
color
and
atmosphere
were
fine
and
i
told
this
to
stone
who
agreed
that
it
was
a
decided
help
in
the
search
julie
portrait
was
the
same
not
a
real
likeness
of
the
woman
but
an
impressionist
transcript
of
her
salient
points
the
gray
gown
and
white
apron
the
glasses
the
parted
lips
showing
slightly
protruding
teeth
the
plainly
parted
brown
hair
all
were
the
real
julie
and
yet
except
for
these
accessories
i
not
sure
i
could
have
recognized
the
subject
of
the
sketch
however
as
i
told
stone
it
certainly
was
a
helpful
indication
of
the
sort
of
woman
he
was
to
look
for
and
even
in
disguise
the
physical
characteristics
must
show
the
detective
was
positive
that
wherever
vicky
van
and
julie
were
or
whatever
they
were
doing
they
were
in
all
probability
disguised
and
thoroughly
so
or
they
must
have
been
discovered
ere
this
to
my
amusement
fibsy
and
ruth
were
holding
a
conversation
the
woman
had
doubtless
felt
sorry
for
the
boy
shyness
and
had
drawn
him
into
chat
to
put
him
at
his
ease
she
had
succeeded
too
for
he
was
animated
and
had
lost
his
under
the
charm
of
her
smile
and
i
bet
your
birthday
comes
in
the
spring
he
was
saying
as
i
caught
the
tenor
of
their
talk
it
does
said
ruth
looking
surprised
how
did
you
guess
you
just
like
a
little
spring
flower
a
white
crocus
or
a
bit
of
arbutus
and
then
noting
my
attention
the
boy
was
covered
with
confusion
and
blushed
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
he
rose
from
where
he
sat
and
shuffled
awkwardly
around
the
great
room
devoting
exaggerated
attention
to
some
books
in
the
glassed
cases
and
twirling
his
fingers
in
acute
embarrassment
you
scared
him
away
chided
ruth
under
her
breath
as
our
glances
met
he
and
i
were
getting
positively
chummy
why
was
he
talking
of
your
birthday
i
asked
i
do
know
i
sure
he
said
i
was
born
in
the
spring
because
like
a
flower
really
that
child
will
grow
up
a
poet
if
he
look
out
you
are
like
a
flower
i
murmured
back
and
i
glad
your
birthday
is
in
spring
i
mean
to
celebrate
it
and
then
i
thought
of
poor
vicky
van
birthday
so
tragically
ended
and
i
quickly
changed
the
subject
armed
with
the
pictures
fleming
stone
and
his
young
assistant
spent
the
next
day
on
a
still
hunt
and
in
the
evening
stone
came
over
to
see
me
a
little
quiet
confab
he
said
as
we
secluded
ourselves
in
my
and
closed
the
door
i
been
to
a
score
of
places
and
invariably
they
recognize
miss
van
allen
and
her
maid
but
all
say
they
not
seen
her
since
the
tragedy
i
went
to
shops
offices
the
bank
and
places
where
she
would
be
likely
to
need
to
go
also
her
friends
houses
but
nothing
doing
the
shops
have
heard
from
her
in
the
way
of
paid
bills
checks
and
such
matters
but
i
learned
absolutely
nothing
that
throws
any
light
on
her
whereabouts
now
calhoun
the
very
thoroughness
of
her
disappearance
the
very
inviolable
secrecy
of
her
proves
to
me
that
she
hiding
now
stone
i
said
smiling
you
talk
like
a
real
detective
cryptic
utterances
of
that
sort
are
impressive
to
the
layman
you
know
pshaw
and
he
looked
annoyed
if
you
knew
anything
about
detective
work
you
know
that
the
most
seemingly
impossible
conditions
are
often
the
easiest
to
explain
well
then
explain
i
be
glad
to
hear
i
will
and
in
return
calhoun
i
going
to
ask
you
if
you
do
think
that
all
things
considered
you
ought
to
tell
me
what
you
are
keeping
back
you
wo
mind
will
you
if
i
say
that
i
have
deduced
from
evidence
he
smiled
that
your
interests
are
largely
coincident
with
those
of
mrs
schuyler
you
on
i
said
shortly
but
not
annoyed
at
his
perspicacity
well
then
i
assure
you
that
schuyler
is
most
desirous
of
locating
miss
van
allen
she
is
not
so
revengeful
or
vituperative
as
the
sisters
of
her
husband
but
she
feels
it
is
due
to
her
memory
to
find
his
slayer
if
possible
now
suppose
you
tell
me
what
you
know
and
i
promise
to
keep
it
an
inviolate
confidence
except
so
far
as
it
actually
helps
the
progress
of
the
wheels
of
justice
i
do
want
to
do
what
is
best
for
schuyler
interests
i
said
after
i
had
thought
a
moment
but
i
must
confess
i
have
a
certain
sympathy
and
pity
for
victoria
van
allen
i
can
not
believe
her
guilty
then
tell
me
frankly
the
truth
if
you
are
right
and
she
is
not
the
murderer
the
truth
ca
harm
her
and
if
she
is
the
guilty
person
you
are
compounding
a
felony
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
to
withhold
your
information
stone
spoke
a
little
sternly
and
i
realized
he
was
right
if
vicky
were
untraceably
hidden
all
i
could
tell
would
hurt
her
and
too
i
could
see
that
it
would
anyway
moreover
as
stone
said
i
was
making
myself
amenable
to
the
law
by
a
refusal
to
tell
all
i
knew
and
since
i
was
so
aware
of
my
own
devotion
to
ruth
schuyler
i
felt
i
had
no
right
to
do
anything
that
she
would
disapprove
and
i
knew
that
a
touch
of
feminine
pique
in
her
disposition
would
resent
any
consideration
of
vicky
over
her
own
claims
therefore
i
told
fleming
stone
all
i
knew
of
victoria
van
allen
both
before
during
and
after
the
occasion
of
her
birthday
party
he
listened
with
his
deep
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
most
extraordinary
he
said
at
last
after
i
had
finished
i
never
heard
of
such
daring
to
enter
her
own
house
when
it
was
watched
by
the
police
only
the
post
patrol
then
i
reminded
him
she
could
easily
manage
between
his
rounds
yes
yes
i
know
but
you
put
the
whole
thing
in
different
focus
tell
me
more
there
was
no
more
to
tell
but
i
went
over
my
story
again
amplifying
and
remembering
further
details
until
we
had
spent
the
whole
evening
he
egged
me
on
by
questions
and
his
burning
eager
eyes
seemed
to
drink
in
my
words
as
if
they
were
so
much
priceless
wisdom
and
i
told
him
too
that
i
had
promised
to
put
vicky
address
book
in
the
chinese
jar
for
her
that
very
evening
we
do
it
he
exclaimed
promptly
she
meant
to
meet
you
there
i
sure
but
i
also
sure
she
changed
her
mind
about
that
when
she
learned
of
my
advent
however
we
keep
your
promise
acting
at
his
instructions
i
went
with
him
over
to
vicky
van
it
was
about
midnight
and
as
he
had
the
address
book
with
him
he
kept
possession
of
it
we
went
in
the
house
and
in
the
dark
felt
our
way
up
to
the
music
room
stone
put
the
book
in
the
jar
and
motioned
for
me
to
hide
behind
a
sofa
he
himself
took
up
his
vigil
behind
a
of
heavy
brocade
he
had
planned
all
this
before
we
left
my
house
and
no
word
was
spoken
as
we
took
our
places
his
hope
was
that
vicky
would
come
into
the
house
late
and
go
straight
for
her
book
and
quickly
out
again
he
had
directed
me
to
wait
until
she
had
really
abstracted
the
book
from
the
jar
and
then
as
she
was
leaving
the
room
spring
after
her
and
stop
her
i
obeyed
orders
implicitly
and
as
stone
had
warned
me
we
had
a
bit
of
a
wait
i
grew
cramped
and
tired
and
at
last
i
gave
up
all
hope
of
vicky
appearance
and
then
she
came
silently
absolutely
without
sound
she
glided
in
from
the
hall
my
eyes
now
accustomed
to
the
of
the
room
could
discern
her
figure
as
it
approached
the
great
vase
softly
she
raised
the
cover
she
abstracted
the
book
and
with
noiseless
touch
was
replacing
the
cover
when
she
threw
back
her
head
as
if
she
sensed
our
presence
i
had
made
no
move
nor
had
i
heard
a
breath
of
sound
from
stone
but
vicky
knew
some
one
was
present
i
knew
that
by
her
startled
movement
she
gave
a
stifled
scream
and
pushing
the
great
jar
off
on
the
floor
where
it
crashed
to
pieces
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
down
stairs
after
her
calhoun
fly
shouted
stone
and
as
he
flung
back
the
heavy
curtains
the
street
lights
illuminated
the
scene
but
as
we
avoided
the
broken
fragments
we
bumped
together
and
lost
a
few
seconds
in
our
recovery
from
the
impact
this
gave
vicky
a
start
and
we
heard
the
street
door
slam
as
we
raced
down
the
stairs
here
too
we
lost
a
second
or
two
for
i
stepped
back
to
give
stone
space
just
as
he
did
the
same
for
me
and
when
we
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
leaped
through
the
hall
wrenched
open
the
door
and
dashed
down
the
steps
to
the
pavement
we
saw
the
flying
figure
of
vicky
van
round
the
fifth
avenue
corner
and
turn
south
after
her
we
ran
as
fast
as
mortal
man
can
run
i
verily
believe
and
when
we
reached
the
avenue
there
was
no
one
in
sight
stone
stood
looking
down
the
street
the
avenue
was
lighted
as
usual
and
we
could
see
a
block
and
more
in
both
directions
but
no
sign
of
vicky
nor
was
there
a
pedestrian
abroad
or
a
motor
the
avenue
was
absolutely
uninhabited
as
far
as
our
eyes
could
reach
where
she
go
i
panted
into
some
house
or
maybe
hiding
in
an
area
we
must
search
them
all
but
very
warily
she
a
witch
a
but
all
the
same
the
earth
did
open
and
swallow
her
we
searched
every
area
way
on
the
block
one
of
us
would
go
in
and
explore
while
the
other
stood
guard
the
third
house
was
the
schuyler
residence
but
stone
also
searched
thoroughly
in
its
basement
entrance
all
dark
and
locked
up
he
reported
as
he
came
out
from
there
and
of
course
she
would
seek
sanctuary
there
but
i
wondered
if
she
is
concealed
in
one
of
these
nearby
houses
as
she
has
such
ready
access
to
her
own
home
but
it
was
impossible
every
basement
entrance
was
locked
and
bolted
for
the
night
and
all
the
windows
were
dark
she
given
us
the
slip
said
stone
in
deep
chagrin
but
perhaps
she
crossed
the
street
maybe
she
did
run
down
this
side
very
far
let
go
over
we
crossed
and
looked
over
the
stone
wall
of
the
park
surely
vicky
van
had
not
had
time
to
scramble
over
that
wall
before
we
reached
the
corner
it
had
been
not
more
than
a
few
seconds
after
we
saw
her
flying
form
turn
down
the
avenue
and
she
could
have
crossed
the
street
and
scaled
the
wall
in
that
time
where
was
she
what
had
become
of
her
ring
up
the
houses
and
inquire
i
suggested
you
justified
in
doing
that
no
use
he
responded
if
she
was
expected
they
wo
give
her
away
and
if
she
is
there
they
be
pretty
angry
at
our
intrusion
admit
calhoun
i
never
been
so
mystified
in
my
life
nor
i
i
emphatically
agreed
chapter
xvii
the
gown
after
that
night
fleming
stone
became
more
desperately
in
earnest
in
his
search
for
vicky
it
seemed
as
if
the
sight
of
her
the
realization
that
she
was
a
real
woman
and
not
a
myth
had
whetted
his
eagerness
to
discover
her
hiding
place
and
bring
her
to
book
he
established
himself
in
her
house
and
both
he
and
fibsy
practically
lived
there
going
out
for
their
meals
or
picnicking
in
the
basement
room
this
room
became
his
headquarters
and
a
plain
clothes
man
was
on
duty
whenever
stone
and
fibsy
were
both
absent
though
i
do
think
she
ever
come
back
again
stone
declared
gloomily
she
was
desperately
anxious
for
that
address
book
and
so
she
got
it
through
my
stupidity
i
might
have
known
she
make
a
dash
for
the
street
door
i
should
have
had
that
exit
guarded
but
seen
her
and
i
get
her
yet
at
any
rate
she
has
left
the
country
or
had
last
night
whatever
she
may
do
it
was
the
day
after
vicky
had
given
us
the
slip
it
was
midafternoon
and
i
had
gone
to
see
stone
on
my
return
from
my
office
i
was
sadly
neglecting
my
own
business
nowadays
but
bradbury
looked
after
it
and
he
sanctioned
my
devotion
to
the
schuyler
cause
randolph
schuyler
was
an
important
citizen
he
said
and
his
murderer
must
be
apprehended
if
possible
do
all
you
can
calhoun
for
humanity
sake
and
the
law
take
all
the
time
you
want
to
i
see
to
your
important
business
so
though
i
went
downtown
every
morning
i
came
back
at
noon
or
soon
after
and
plunged
afresh
into
the
work
of
finding
vicky
van
there
was
little
i
could
do
but
stone
consulted
and
questioned
me
continually
as
to
vicky
habits
or
pursuits
and
i
told
him
frankly
all
i
knew
also
i
managed
to
make
business
matters
loom
up
so
importantly
as
to
necessitate
frequent
calls
on
ruth
schuyler
and
i
spent
most
of
my
afternoon
hours
in
the
fifth
avenue
house
and
ruth
was
most
kind
to
me
i
could
say
she
showed
affection
or
even
especial
interest
but
she
turned
to
me
as
a
confidant
and
we
had
many
long
pleasant
conversations
when
the
subject
of
the
mystery
was
not
touched
upon
though
she
never
said
a
word
against
randolph
schuyler
i
help
learning
that
aside
from
the
horror
of
it
his
death
was
to
her
a
blessed
relief
he
had
not
been
a
good
man
nor
had
he
been
a
good
husband
on
the
contrary
he
had
blighted
ruth
whole
life
by
thwarting
her
every
innocent
desire
for
gayety
or
pleasure
for
instance
she
spoke
of
her
great
enjoyment
of
light
opera
or
farce
comedy
but
as
schuyler
did
care
for
such
entertainment
he
had
never
allowed
her
to
go
he
had
a
box
at
the
grand
opera
and
ruth
loved
to
go
but
she
liked
lighter
music
also
this
was
not
told
complainingly
but
transpired
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
at
which
fibsy
chanced
to
be
present
gee
he
said
looking
at
ruth
commiseratingly
ai
you
never
heard
jitney
girl
or
prince
of
peoria
ruth
shook
her
head
smiling
at
the
boy
amazement
there
was
a
subtle
sympathy
between
these
two
that
surprised
me
for
ruth
schuyler
was
fastidious
in
her
choice
of
friends
but
he
amused
her
and
he
was
never
really
impertinent
merely
naive
and
unconventional
well
on
the
day
i
speak
of
stone
and
i
sat
in
the
basement
room
awaiting
fibsy
return
he
was
out
after
certain
information
and
we
hoped
much
from
it
i
got
ta
bunch
o
dope
he
announced
as
he
suddenly
appeared
before
us
dunno
it
pan
out
much
but
listen
i
spill
a
earful
i
had
learned
that
fibsy
or
terence
as
we
ought
to
call
him
was
trying
to
discard
his
street
slang
and
was
succeeding
fairly
well
save
in
moments
of
great
excitement
or
importance
and
so
i
hoped
from
his
slangy
beginning
that
he
had
found
some
fresh
data
i
chased
up
that
chore
boy
first
he
related
an
he
did
know
anything
at
all
said
miss
van
allen
a
lovely
lady
but
he
never
saw
her
the
julie
dame
did
all
the
orderin
an
payin
he
was
concerned
good
pay
but
irregular
work
she
be
here
a
day
or
two
an
then
like
not
go
for
a
week
well
we
knew
that
before
then
next
i
tracked
to
his
lair
the
furnace
man
same
story
here
an
gone
as
the
song
says
he
ai
only
a
stoker
he
really
an
odd
job
man
ashes
sidewalks
such
well
he
did
help
none
any
i
mean
but
and
the
shock
of
red
hair
seemed
to
bristle
with
triumph
i
loined
one
thing
that
julie
has
been
to
the
sewing
woman
and
the
laundress
lady
and
shut
up
yes
sir
that
what
she
done
tell
it
all
said
stone
briefly
well
i
struck
the
seamstress
first
she
would
tell
a
thing
and
i
said
calmly
know
julie
paid
you
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
but
if
you
do
tell
the
law
make
you
that
scared
her
and
she
owned
up
that
julie
was
to
see
her
a
week
ago
and
give
her
fifty
dollars
not
to
tell
anything
at
all
whatsomever
about
miss
van
allen
some
girl
that
vicky
van
julie
went
there
herself
i
cried
yep
the
real
julie
gold
teeth
and
all
but
i
quizzed
the
needle
pusher
good
and
plenty
and
she
do
know
much
of
evidential
value
it
was
always
funny
when
fibsy
interlarded
his
talk
with
legal
phrases
but
he
was
unconscious
of
any
incongruity
and
went
on
you
see
as
i
dope
it
out
she
accustomed
to
sit
in
miss
van
allen
boodore
an
might
have
overheard
some
gossip
or
sumpum
like
that
an
miss
van
allen
was
afraid
she
scatter
it
so
she
sent
julie
to
shut
her
up
i
do
believe
the
woman
knows
where
miss
van
is
now
i
must
see
her
said
stone
yes
sir
she
wo
get
away
she
a
regular
citizen
respectable
at
that
well
then
the
laundress
to
her
also
julie
had
likewise
went
an
to
her
also
julie
had
passed
the
spondulicks
now
i
do
understand
that
so
well
for
laundresses
do
overhear
the
ladies
talkin
but
anyway
julie
told
her
if
she
would
answer
a
question
to
anybody
she
give
her
half
a
century
too
and
did
doubtless
the
laundress
knew
something
miss
van
allen
wants
kept
secret
doubtless
sir
said
fibsy
gravely
but
i
do
believe
mused
stone
that
it
would
help
us
any
to
learn
all
those
women
know
if
miss
van
allen
thought
they
could
help
us
find
her
she
would
give
them
more
than
that
for
silence
or
get
them
out
of
the
city
altogether
where
is
miss
van
allen
mr
stone
fibsy
asked
the
question
casually
as
one
expectant
of
an
answer
she
in
the
city
fibs
living
as
somebody
else
yep
that
so
over
on
the
west
side
say
among
the
artist
studio
gang
maybe
so
but
she
has
full
freedom
of
action
and
goes
about
as
she
likes
julie
also
they
come
here
whenever
they
choose
though
i
think
they
come
while
we
here
it
a
queer
state
of
things
calhoun
what
do
you
make
of
it
i
do
believe
vicky
is
disguised
her
personality
is
too
pronounced
and
so
is
julie
i
think
some
friend
is
caring
for
them
not
ariadne
gale
of
that
i
sure
but
it
may
be
reeves
she
is
very
fond
of
vicky
and
is
clever
enough
to
hide
the
girl
all
this
time
the
police
have
searched
her
house
i
know
but
reeves
and
vicky
could
connive
a
plan
that
would
hoodwink
the
police
i
pretty
certain
i
look
into
that
and
stone
made
a
note
of
it
about
that
carving
knife
fibsy
did
the
caterers
take
it
away
by
mistake
no
sir
i
that
an
they
did
that
knife
is
an
important
thing
to
my
mind
the
detective
went
on
yes
sir
eagerly
agreed
fibsy
it
may
yet
cut
the
gorgian
knot
why
stone
the
sewing
lady
knew
that
knife
she
was
here
to
lunching
a
few
days
before
the
moider
an
she
says
she
always
sat
at
the
table
in
the
dining
room
to
eat
after
miss
van
allen
got
through
an
she
says
that
knife
was
there
they
had
steak
an
she
used
it
herself
i
described
the
fork
puffeckly
an
she
reckernized
it
at
onct
you
a
bright
boy
i
exclaimed
in
involuntary
tribute
to
this
clever
bit
of
work
i
with
stone
said
fibsy
with
a
quiet
twinkle
it
was
clever
agreed
stone
i
sure
myself
that
the
absence
of
that
small
carving
knife
means
something
but
i
ca
fit
it
in
yet
we
went
up
to
the
to
look
again
at
the
carving
fork
still
in
its
place
on
the
sideboard
i
was
always
thrilled
at
a
return
to
this
room
always
reminded
of
the
awful
tableau
i
had
seen
there
the
long
slender
fork
lay
in
its
place
though
it
had
been
repeatedly
examined
and
puzzled
over
it
had
been
carefully
replaced
but
i
ca
see
i
offered
why
a
should
figure
in
the
matter
at
all
when
the
crime
was
committed
with
the
little
that
why
the
missing
ought
to
be
a
clue
said
stone
because
its
connection
with
the
case
is
inexplicable
now
where
is
that
knife
fibsy
where
is
it
fleming
stone
frequent
appeals
to
the
boy
were
often
in
a
tone
and
yet
rather
often
terence
returned
an
opinion
or
a
bit
of
conjecture
that
turned
stone
cogitations
in
a
fresh
direction
you
see
sir
he
said
this
time
that
knife
is
in
this
house
gotter
be
that
lady
left
the
house
in
a
mighty
hurry
but
all
the
same
she
did
go
out
a
brandishin
of
a
nor
did
she
take
it
along
an
drop
it
in
the
street
or
an
ash
can
for
it
been
found
so
she
siccreted
it
summer
an
it
still
in
the
house
unless
yes
unless
she
has
taken
it
away
since
you
know
stone
the
van
allen
has
been
in
this
house
more
times
than
you
think
for
yes
sir
she
has
how
do
you
know
lots
o
ways
frinst
on
i
noticed
a
clean
squarish
place
in
the
dust
on
a
table
in
the
lady
bedroom
an
it
where
a
book
was
that
book
disappeared
durin
friday
night
i
do
remember
seein
the
book
i
did
notice
it
to
know
what
book
it
was
but
the
clean
place
in
the
dust
could
get
there
no
other
way
well
all
is
it
shows
miss
vick
comes
an
goes
pretty
much
as
she
likes
or
did
till
me
camped
out
here
then
you
think
she
left
the
knife
here
that
night
and
has
since
returned
and
taken
it
away
i
donno
fibsy
scowled
in
his
effort
to
deduce
the
truth
look
he
darted
from
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
stone
rose
to
follow
that
boy
is
uncanny
at
times
he
said
seriously
i
only
too
glad
to
follow
his
intuitions
and
not
seldom
he
all
right
we
went
upstairs
and
then
on
up
to
the
next
floor
fibsy
was
in
vicky
van
dressing
room
staring
about
him
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
his
hands
in
his
pockets
wheeling
round
on
one
heel
they
say
she
ran
upstairs
she
flew
the
coop
he
murmured
not
looking
at
us
that
miss
weldon
said
that
well
if
she
did
she
natchelly
came
up
here
for
a
cloak
an
bonnet
i
never
believe
that
young
person
went
out
into
the
cold
woild
in
her
glad
rags
an
no
coverin
well
then
say
she
lef
that
knife
here
locked
up
good
an
plenty
where
i
say
would
she
siccrete
it
he
glared
round
the
room
as
if
trying
to
wrest
the
secret
from
its
inanimate
contents
stone
says
that
walls
have
tongues
i
believe
it
an
i
know
these
walls
are
jest
yellin
the
truth
at
me
an
yet
i
so
i
ca
make
out
their
lingo
well
let
make
a
stab
at
it
stone
i
lay
you
that
knife
is
in
some
drawer
or
cubbid
in
this
here
very
room
maybe
fibsy
said
stone
cheerfully
where
shall
we
look
first
all
over
and
fibsy
darted
to
a
wardrobe
and
began
feeling
among
the
gowns
and
wraps
hanging
there
with
a
touch
as
light
as
a
he
slid
his
fingers
through
the
folds
of
silk
and
tulle
and
turned
back
with
a
disappointed
air
frisked
the
whole
pack
nothin
doin
he
grumbled
but
do
give
up
the
ship
we
did
having
something
definite
to
do
we
did
it
thoroughly
and
two
men
and
a
boy
fingered
every
one
of
vicky
van
available
belongings
in
an
amazingly
short
space
of
time
now
for
this
chest
said
fibsy
indicating
a
large
low
box
on
rollers
that
he
pulled
out
from
under
the
couch
it
was
locked
but
stone
picked
it
open
and
threw
back
the
cover
at
the
bottom
of
it
beneath
several
other
gowns
we
found
the
costume
vicky
had
worn
the
night
of
the
murder
my
good
land
ejaculated
fibsy
the
rig
ai
it
classy
stone
lifted
out
the
dress
heavy
with
its
weight
of
gold
beads
and
held
it
up
to
view
on
the
flounces
were
stains
of
blood
and
from
the
wrinkled
folds
fell
with
a
clatter
to
the
floor
the
missing
i
stooped
to
pick
up
the
knife
me
calhoun
cried
fibsy
grasping
my
hand
do
touch
it
finger
prints
you
know
right
boy
and
stone
nodded
approvingly
pick
it
up
fibsy
yessir
and
taking
from
his
pocket
a
pair
of
peculiar
shaped
tongs
terence
carefully
lifted
the
knife
and
laid
it
on
the
dressing
table
probly
all
smudged
anyway
he
muttered
squinting
closely
at
the
knife
but
there
sure
some
marks
on
it
gee
stone
sumpum
doin
his
eyes
shone
and
his
skinny
little
fingers
trembled
with
excitement
of
the
chase
stone
studied
the
dress
the
blood
stains
on
the
flounces
though
dried
and
brown
were
unmistakable
wonderful
woman
he
exclaimed
now
we
got
this
dress
and
what
of
it
she
put
it
here
not
caring
whether
we
got
it
or
not
gone
for
good
she
never
be
taken
this
proves
it
to
my
mind
and
the
knife
i
asked
thrilling
with
interest
there
you
are
again
if
miss
van
allen
put
that
there
for
us
to
discover
the
marks
on
it
are
of
no
use
perhaps
some
she
had
put
there
purposely
you
see
i
inclined
to
grant
her
any
degree
of
cleverness
from
what
i
know
of
her
ability
so
far
she
is
a
witch
she
can
hoodwink
anybody
except
stone
esquire
amended
fibsy
you
pussieve
calhoun
the
detective
is
already
onto
her
coives
stone
looked
up
to
smile
at
the
boy
speech
but
he
returned
his
gaze
to
the
gown
of
course
he
said
it
is
improbable
that
she
took
this
off
before
she
left
the
house
that
night
i
opine
she
threw
a
big
cloak
round
her
and
rushed
out
to
the
house
of
some
friend
likely
she
found
a
taxicab
or
even
commandeered
some
waiting
private
car
for
her
flight
you
know
we
are
dealing
with
no
ordinary
criminal
now
if
i
am
right
she
brought
this
gown
back
here
on
some
of
her
subsequent
trips
as
to
the
knife
i
do
know
i
see
no
explanation
as
yet
since
she
stabbed
her
victim
with
another
knife
why
in
the
world
hide
this
one
up
here
what
say
fibsy
past
me
maybe
she
was
usin
both
knives
an
the
other
one
turned
the
trick
an
when
she
got
up
here
she
seen
she
had
this
one
still
in
her
grip
an
she
slung
it
in
this
here
chest
to
hide
it
i
ai
sure
that
the
answer
but
it
do
i
say
stone
i
got
an
awful
funny
thing
to
ask
you
it
wo
be
the
first
funny
thing
you
asked
me
terence
what
is
it
well
it
pretty
near
eatin
time
an
aw
pshaw
i
jest
ca
dare
to
say
it
go
ahead
old
chap
i
ca
do
more
than
annihilate
you
well
i
wan
na
go
to
the
schuylerses
to
dinner
to
dinner
yes
sir
an
not
to
the
kitchen
eats
neither
i
wanta
set
up
to
their
gran
table
with
their
butlerses
an
feetmen
an
be
a
nonnerd
guest
kin
i
stone
say
kinni
fleming
stone
looked
at
the
eager
flushed
face
he
knew
and
i
did
too
that
there
was
something
back
of
this
request
but
it
could
be
anything
of
vital
importance
to
our
mystery
oh
i
understand
said
stone
suddenly
you
taken
a
desperate
fancy
to
schuyler
and
you
want
to
further
the
acquaintance
but
it
is
often
done
that
way
my
boy
aw
now
do
kid
me
stone
either
lem
me
go
or
shut
down
on
it
one
o
the
six
but
it
most
nessary
i
do
assure
you
maybe
she
wo
have
you
why
should
those
grand
ladies
allow
a
boy
of
your
age
at
their
because
you
ask
sir
fibsy
tone
was
full
of
a
quiet
dignity
very
well
i
ask
them
and
stone
went
away
to
the
telephone
fibsy
stood
looking
raptly
at
the
gold
gown
and
now
and
then
his
eyes
turned
toward
the
knife
on
the
the
table
was
covered
with
silver
toilet
implements
and
save
for
its
unfitting
suggestion
the
knife
was
unnoticeable
among
the
other
trinkets
it
all
right
said
stone
returning
schuyler
sends
a
cordial
invitation
for
all
three
of
us
to
dine
with
her
much
obliged
i
be
there
said
fibsy
unsmilingly
chapter
xviii
fibsy
dines
out
that
dinner
at
ruth
schuyler
was
memorable
and
yet
it
was
in
no
way
markedly
unusual
the
service
was
perfect
as
might
be
expected
in
that
household
and
the
guests
were
well
behaved
fibsy
thanks
to
fleming
stone
thoughtful
kindness
was
arrayed
in
the
proper
dinner
garb
of
a
schoolboy
and
his
immaculate
linen
and
correct
jacket
seemed
to
invest
him
in
a
mantle
of
politeness
that
sat
well
on
his
youthful
buoyancy
and
enthusiasm
i
glanced
round
the
table
it
was
a
strange
combination
of
people
fleming
stone
was
the
sort
of
man
who
is
at
ease
anywhere
and
i
too
am
adaptable
by
nature
but
the
schuyler
sisters
were
very
evidently
annoyed
at
the
idea
of
receiving
as
an
equal
the
youth
whom
they
regarded
as
a
mere
street
arab
fibsy
had
become
a
firm
friend
of
ruth
but
he
could
seem
to
like
the
other
ladies
and
he
with
difficulty
refrained
from
showing
this
the
misses
schuyler
were
impressive
in
their
heavy
and
elaborate
mourning
and
to
my
mind
ruth
looked
far
more
appropriately
dressed
she
wore
a
black
and
white
striped
chiffon
with
touches
of
black
silk
and
the
effect
with
her
pale
face
and
fair
hair
was
lovely
a
breastknot
of
valley
lilies
added
to
the
loveliness
and
i
allowed
my
eyes
to
feast
on
her
fairness
i
had
thought
ruth
was
not
what
could
be
called
a
pretty
woman
certainly
she
was
not
beautiful
but
that
night
her
charm
appealed
to
me
more
strongly
than
ever
and
i
concluded
that
her
air
of
delicacy
and
infinite
fineness
were
more
to
be
desired
than
mere
beauty
fibsy
too
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
though
discreetly
and
when
he
thought
he
was
not
observed
fleming
stone
devoted
himself
to
the
sisters
probably
i
concluded
because
he
was
in
their
employ
and
so
owed
them
his
attention
ruth
wore
her
beautiful
pearls
and
referred
to
the
fact
saying
that
schuyler
had
liked
always
to
see
them
on
her
and
she
felt
privileged
to
continue
to
use
them
even
in
her
mourning
period
you
like
only
poils
pearls
do
you
mrs
schuyler
fibsy
slip
of
pronunciation
was
due
to
his
slight
embarrassment
at
his
novel
surroundings
but
he
valiantly
corrected
himself
and
ignored
it
i
like
other
gems
ruth
replied
but
schuyler
preferred
pearls
and
gave
me
such
beauties
that
i
have
grown
very
fond
of
them
i
remember
ruth
said
sarah
reminiscently
how
you
used
to
beg
randolph
for
sapphires
and
diamonds
instead
you
even
wanted
stones
turquoises
and
topaz
oh
i
remember
but
randolph
taught
you
that
pearls
were
the
best
taste
for
a
young
matron
and
you
grudgingly
acquiesced
oh
not
grudgingly
sarah
and
ruth
flushed
at
the
reprimand
in
her
sister
voice
yes
grudgingly
even
unwillingly
in
fact
all
randolph
decisions
you
fought
until
he
made
you
surrender
you
know
how
you
wanted
gowns
until
he
made
you
see
that
grays
and
mauves
were
better
taste
never
mind
my
peccadilloes
said
ruth
lightly
let
talk
of
something
less
personal
let
talk
about
the
weather
suggested
fibsy
who
was
not
conducting
himself
on
the
seen
and
not
heard
plan
the
park
is
fine
now
all
full
o
red
an
gold
autumn
leaves
have
you
noticed
it
mrs
schuyler
not
especially
and
ruth
smiled
at
him
in
appreciation
of
his
conversational
help
i
must
walk
over
there
yes
an
why
do
you
go
for
a
long
motor
ride
up
westchester
way
the
scenery
great
how
do
you
know
have
you
been
there
not
just
lately
but
i
was
last
fall
do
you
remember
the
big
trees
just
at
the
turn
of
the
road
by
but
ruth
was
not
listening
to
the
child
stone
had
said
something
that
claimed
her
attention
however
fibsy
was
unabashed
with
no
trace
of
forwardness
but
with
due
belief
in
his
security
of
position
as
a
guest
he
continued
to
chatter
to
ruth
and
rarely
addressed
any
one
else
he
has
something
up
his
sleeve
i
thought
for
i
was
beginning
to
have
great
faith
in
the
lad
cleverness
he
sat
at
ruth
left
hand
stone
being
in
the
seat
of
the
honor
guest
and
as
that
left
me
between
the
two
sisters
i
was
doomed
to
participate
in
their
chatter
but
i
was
opposite
my
hostess
and
could
enjoy
looking
at
her
in
the
intervals
of
conversation
suddenly
i
chanced
to
look
up
and
i
saw
fibsy
comical
little
face
drawn
with
grimaces
as
he
sang
a
snatch
of
a
popular
song
my
heart
goes
when
i
see
my
pearlie
girlie
with
her
now
what
is
that
next
line
with
her
with
her
curls
supplemented
ruth
her
own
face
breaking
into
laughter
as
caught
by
the
infection
of
fibsy
waggish
gayety
she
rounded
out
the
phrase
yes
that
it
said
fibsy
eagerly
and
her
teeth
like
little
shining
pearls
oh
she
my
queen
of
all
the
girls
my
little
pearlie
girlie
ruth
and
fibsy
finished
the
silly
little
song
in
concert
and
stone
clapped
his
hands
in
applause
rhoda
sniffed
and
sarah
acidly
remarked
how
can
you
ruth
i
wish
you
be
a
little
more
dignified
quickly
the
light
went
out
of
ruth
eyes
she
looked
reproved
and
though
she
did
resent
it
a
patient
sadness
came
into
her
eyes
and
i
resolved
that
i
would
do
all
i
could
to
get
it
arranged
that
she
should
live
apart
from
the
two
carping
criticizing
sisters
after
dinner
we
had
coffee
in
the
library
again
fleming
stone
took
it
upon
himself
to
entertain
the
misses
schuyler
and
i
drifted
toward
ruth
she
sat
down
on
a
sofa
and
motioned
fibsy
to
sit
beside
her
i
drew
a
chair
up
to
them
and
thanked
a
kind
fate
that
let
us
all
leave
the
table
at
once
dispensing
with
a
more
formal
tarrying
of
the
men
after
the
coffee
there
were
liqueurs
i
glanced
at
fibsy
to
see
if
he
accepted
a
tiny
glass
from
the
butler
tray
he
did
and
moreover
he
examined
the
contents
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
oo
de
vee
de
dantzic
he
remarked
holding
up
his
glass
and
gazing
at
the
gold
flecks
in
it
we
all
smiled
at
him
your
favorite
cordial
terence
asked
stone
affably
yessir
do
you
love
it
mrs
schuyler
yes
she
said
and
then
why
no
i
do
love
it
child
but
one
gets
accustomed
to
something
of
the
sort
but
do
you
like
it
better
than
cream
de
mint
or
benediction
he
persisted
ruth
laughed
outright
how
do
you
know
those
names
you
funny
boy
she
said
read
on
the
big
signboards
he
returned
they
have
the
biggest
billboards
in
new
york
for
one
of
these
lickures
i
forget
which
one
these
are
what
i
like
said
ruth
smiling
as
the
footman
passed
a
small
bowl
of
sugared
and
crisp
green
candied
mint
leaves
take
some
terence
they
better
for
you
than
liqueurs
help
yourself
they
are
good
and
fibsy
obeyed
her
they
taste
like
goin
into
a
florist
shop
so
they
do
agreed
ruth
herself
taking
a
goodly
portion
rubbish
said
rhoda
i
think
these
things
are
silly
randolph
would
never
allow
them
now
rhoda
there
no
harm
in
a
few
candies
protested
ruth
and
then
she
changed
the
subject
quickly
for
she
evaded
a
passage
at
arms
with
the
sisters
whenever
possible
the
talk
however
soon
drifted
to
the
never
forgotten
subject
of
the
murder
the
sisters
mulled
over
all
they
had
heard
or
learned
during
the
day
and
begged
stone
to
propound
theories
or
make
deductions
therefrom
stone
obeyed
as
that
was
what
he
was
employed
for
i
think
miss
van
allen
is
masquerading
as
somebody
else
he
affirmed
i
believe
she
is
in
some
house
not
very
far
from
this
neighborhood
under
the
care
of
some
friend
and
accompanied
and
looked
after
by
her
maid
julie
i
believe
she
is
in
touch
with
all
that
goes
on
not
only
from
the
newspapers
but
by
means
of
some
spy
system
or
secret
investigation
but
the
net
is
drawing
round
her
i
can
not
say
just
how
but
i
feel
sure
that
we
shall
yet
get
her
it
was
a
grievous
mischance
that
i
let
her
escape
last
night
but
i
shall
have
another
chance
at
her
i
sure
and
then
you
arrest
her
said
rhoda
with
a
snap
of
her
thin
lips
i
dare
say
lowney
tells
me
the
finger
prints
on
the
little
knife
with
which
schuyler
was
killed
are
clear
and
unmistakable
but
we
have
not
yet
found
out
whose
they
are
and
can
you
said
ruth
anxiously
if
we
find
miss
van
allen
said
stone
we
can
at
least
see
if
they
are
her
pooh
said
fibsy
contemptuously
why
youse
tell
me
before
that
you
had
the
claw
prints
i
kin
get
miss
van
allen
all
right
all
right
how
said
i
for
fibsy
had
lapsed
into
the
careless
speech
that
meant
business
over
to
her
house
why
they
all
over
i
only
gotto
photygraph
some
brushes
an
things
on
her
dressin
table
to
get
all
the
prints
you
want
that
true
agreed
stone
but
it
wo
give
us
what
we
want
nobody
doubts
that
miss
van
allen
held
the
knife
that
stabbed
schuyler
and
to
prove
it
would
be
a
certain
satisfaction
but
what
we
want
is
the
woman
herself
it
was
then
that
i
noticed
ruth
maid
tibbetts
hovering
in
the
hall
outside
the
library
door
you
may
go
home
tibbetts
ruth
said
to
her
kindly
these
gentlemen
will
stay
late
and
i
look
after
them
myself
tibbetts
went
away
and
ruth
said
explanatorily
my
maid
is
a
treasure
i
like
to
have
her
live
here
but
she
is
devoted
to
her
own
little
roof
tree
and
i
let
her
off
whenever
possible
i
knew
tibbets
had
a
home
over
on
second
or
third
avenue
and
i
thought
it
kind
of
ruth
to
indulge
her
in
this
but
after
a
change
of
domicile
herself
perhaps
ruth
would
arrange
differently
for
her
maid
and
too
as
winnie
had
often
told
me
of
ruth
cleverness
and
efficiency
in
looking
after
herself
and
her
belongings
i
well
knew
she
could
get
along
without
a
maid
whenever
necessary
did
you
ever
trace
that
picture
in
schuyler
watch
ruth
asked
a
few
moments
later
yes
i
said
it
was
just
as
we
supposed
a
little
vaudeville
actress
whom
schuyler
had
taken
out
to
supper
gave
it
to
him
and
he
stuck
it
in
his
watch
case
temporarily
her
name
is
dotty
fay
and
she
seemed
to
know
little
about
schuyler
and
cared
less
merely
the
toy
of
an
evening
she
was
to
him
and
merely
a
chance
that
the
picture
was
in
his
watch
the
night
of
his
visit
to
vicky
van
we
had
come
to
discuss
the
personal
matters
of
randolph
schuyler
thus
freely
for
we
were
all
at
one
in
our
search
for
the
truth
and
there
were
no
secrets
or
evasions
among
us
ruth
sighed
but
i
knew
her
dear
face
so
well
now
that
i
realized
it
was
not
from
personal
sorrow
but
a
general
regret
that
a
man
of
schuyler
ability
and
power
should
have
been
such
a
weakling
morally
i
knew
she
had
never
loved
her
husband
but
she
had
been
a
faithful
and
dutiful
wife
and
no
word
or
hint
of
blame
had
ever
escaped
her
lips
regarding
him
she
had
been
a
martyr
but
i
learned
this
from
her
the
sisters
though
unconsciously
told
me
much
of
the
deprivation
and
narrowness
of
ruth
life
schuyler
had
ruled
her
with
a
rod
of
iron
and
she
had
never
rebelled
though
at
times
her
patience
was
nearly
worn
out
later
in
the
evening
fibsy
asked
for
some
phonograph
music
expressing
his
great
delight
in
hearing
a
really
fine
instrument
and
good
records
i
doubt
if
you
care
for
our
selections
ruth
remarked
as
she
looked
over
the
cabinet
of
records
they
almost
all
classical
or
songs
i
like
the
classical
kind
fibsy
said
endeavoring
to
be
agreeable
please
play
the
gayest
you
have
though
but
there
were
few
gay
ones
in
the
collection
wagner
operas
and
beethoven
solemn
marches
gave
forth
their
noble
numbers
and
fibsy
sat
politely
listening
no
ragtime
i
he
said
after
a
particularly
depressing
fugue
resounded
its
last
echoes
no
and
ruth
glanced
at
him
schuyler
did
care
for
rag
time
on
the
phonograph
she
added
perhaps
remembering
dotty
fay
we
stayed
late
several
times
stone
proposed
our
departure
but
ruth
urged
us
to
remain
longer
or
began
some
subject
of
interest
that
held
us
in
spite
of
ourselves
i
had
never
seen
her
so
entertaining
indeed
i
had
never
before
seen
her
in
what
might
be
called
a
society
setting
she
was
a
charming
hostess
and
the
occasion
seemed
to
please
her
for
there
was
a
pink
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
an
added
brightness
to
her
gray
eyes
that
convinced
me
anew
of
the
joy
she
could
take
in
simple
pleasures
she
singled
out
fibsy
for
her
especial
attentions
and
the
boy
accepted
the
honor
with
a
gentle
grace
that
astounded
me
when
talking
to
her
he
lost
entirely
his
slang
and
uncouth
diction
and
behaved
as
to
the
manner
born
he
was
chameleonic
i
could
see
and
he
unconsciously
took
color
from
his
surroundings
and
sometimes
i
caught
him
gazing
at
ruth
with
a
strange
expression
that
mingled
amazement
and
sadness
and
i
could
understand
it
at
all
again
i
would
find
ruth
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
a
beseeching
glance
that
might
mean
anything
or
nothing
as
a
whole
the
atmosphere
seemed
surcharged
with
a
nameless
excitement
almost
a
terror
as
if
something
dire
were
impending
once
or
twice
i
saw
stone
and
terence
exchange
startled
glances
but
they
rarely
looked
at
each
other
there
was
something
brewing
of
that
i
was
sure
but
whatever
it
was
it
did
not
affect
the
schuyler
sisters
they
were
eager
to
talk
anxious
to
hear
but
they
felt
nothing
of
the
undercurrent
of
mysterious
meaning
that
affected
the
rest
of
us
i
was
glad
when
the
time
came
to
go
it
was
very
late
nearly
midnight
and
i
marveled
to
see
that
ruth
showed
no
sign
of
weariness
the
sisters
had
been
frankly
yawning
for
some
time
but
ruth
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
and
her
pale
cheeks
showed
a
tiny
red
spot
on
either
side
she
shook
hands
nervously
and
her
voice
trembled
as
she
said
fleming
stone
and
the
boy
were
moved
i
could
see
that
but
they
made
their
adieux
without
reference
to
future
meeting
or
further
work
on
the
mystery
we
went
away
and
as
we
turned
the
corner
i
started
to
cross
the
street
to
go
to
my
home
come
into
the
van
allen
house
a
few
minutes
calhoun
said
stone
gravely
i
something
to
tell
you
we
went
in
at
vicky
van
stone
manner
was
ominous
he
and
fibsy
both
were
silent
and
we
went
in
at
the
street
door
into
the
hall
and
then
to
the
stone
and
i
sat
down
and
fibsy
darted
out
to
the
back
to
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
flashing
on
lights
as
he
went
in
silence
stone
lighted
a
cigar
and
offered
me
one
which
i
took
feeling
a
strange
notion
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
about
to
come
in
another
moment
fibsy
came
slowly
down
stairs
walked
into
the
where
we
were
gave
one
look
at
stone
and
then
threw
himself
on
a
divan
buried
his
face
in
the
cushions
and
burst
into
tears
his
thin
little
frame
shook
with
sobs
great
deep
sobs
that
made
my
own
heart
stand
still
with
fear
what
could
it
all
mean
what
ailed
the
boy
tell
me
stone
i
begged
what
is
it
what
has
upset
him
so
he
has
found
vicky
van
said
fleming
stone
and
it
has
broken
his
heart
what
do
you
mean
do
keep
me
in
this
suspense
where
is
vicky
upstairs
no
said
stone
not
now
explain
please
i
said
beginning
to
get
angry
i
will
said
stone
no
cried
fibsy
no
stone
let
me
a
minute
i
tell
oh
i
knew
it
all
day
i
could
believe
it
i
believe
it
why
calhoun
vicky
van
is
is
why
schuyler
is
vicky
van
chapter
xix
proofs
and
more
proofs
you
are
absolutely
crazy
i
said
laughing
though
the
laugh
choked
in
my
throat
as
i
looked
at
stone
you
see
fibsy
you
gone
dotty
over
this
thing
and
you
running
round
in
circles
i
know
both
schuyler
and
miss
van
allen
and
they
nothing
in
common
there
could
be
two
people
more
dissimilar
that
just
it
that
how
i
know
wailed
the
boy
that
how
i
first
caught
on
you
see
oh
tell
him
mr
stone
the
boy
is
right
said
stone
slowly
and
the
he
ca
be
right
it
impossible
i
fairly
shouted
as
thoughts
came
flashing
into
my
mind
dreadful
thoughts
appalling
thoughts
ruth
schuyler
and
vicky
van
one
person
why
then
ruth
killed
no
a
thousand
times
no
it
could
be
true
the
boy
was
insane
and
stone
was
too
i
show
them
their
own
foolishness
stop
a
minute
stone
i
said
trying
to
speak
calmly
you
and
the
boy
never
knew
vicky
van
you
never
saw
her
except
as
she
ran
along
the
street
for
a
few
steps
at
midnight
and
terence
did
see
her
then
it
too
absurd
this
theory
of
yours
but
it
startled
me
when
you
sprung
it
now
fibsy
stop
your
sobbing
and
tell
me
what
makes
you
think
this
foolish
thing
and
i
relieve
your
mind
of
any
such
ideas
i
do
blame
you
calhoun
and
fibsy
mopped
his
eyes
with
his
wet
handkerchief
he
was
a
strange
little
figure
in
his
new
clothes
but
with
his
red
hair
tumbled
and
his
eyes
big
and
swollen
with
weeping
i
know
you
ca
believe
it
but
you
listen
a
bit
while
i
tell
stone
some
things
then
you
see
yes
terence
said
stone
go
ahead
what
about
the
prints
they
prove
up
and
fibsy
woe
increased
afresh
they
ai
no
shadder
of
doubt
the
very
reason
i
know
they
the
same
is
they
so
unlike
yes
i
explain
wait
a
minute
again
a
crying
spell
overwhelmed
him
and
we
waited
now
he
said
regaining
now
i
spilled
all
my
tears
i
out
with
it
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
was
the
abserlute
unlikeness
of
those
two
ladies
i
mean
in
their
tastes
an
ways
why
fer
instance
an
i
guess
it
was
jest
about
the
very
first
thing
i
noticed
was
the
magazines
in
here
on
miss
van
allen
table
as
you
can
see
yourself
is
jest
look
at
vogue
vanity
fair
life
cosmopolitan
an
lots
of
story
magazines
in
at
schuylers
house
is
atlantic
monthly
harper
century
the
forum
the
north
american
review
and
a
lot
of
other
highbrow
reading
it
ai
that
the
magazines
in
here
are
gayer
an
lighter
in
there
heavier
an
wiser
but
there
is
a
single
duplicate
now
miss
vicky
van
likes
good
readin
you
can
see
from
her
books
an
all
so
why
do
she
take
harper
an
century
she
has
in
her
other
home
but
wait
child
i
cried
getting
bewildered
you
do
mean
vicky
van
lives
sometimes
in
this
house
and
sometimes
in
the
schuyler
house
as
its
mistress
that
jest
what
i
do
mean
i
know
it
sounds
like
i
was
batty
but
let
me
tell
more
well
it
seemed
queer
that
there
should
be
any
one
magazine
took
in
both
houses
but
of
course
that
was
no
real
proof
i
only
noticed
it
an
it
set
me
a
thinkin
then
i
sized
up
their
situations
schuyler
dignified
an
quiet
in
her
ways
simple
in
her
dress
wears
only
poils
no
other
sparklers
whatever
vicky
van
gay
of
action
likes
giddy
rags
and
adores
gorgeous
jewelry
even
if
it
ai
the
most
realest
kind
now
wait
interrup
me
lem
me
talk
it
out
it
killin
me
an
i
gotter
get
it
over
with
well
all
schuyler
things
furnicher
i
mean
is
big
an
heavy
an
massive
an
terrible
expensive
yes
i
know
her
husband
made
her
have
it
that
way
but
never
mind
that
vicky
van
furnicher
is
all
gay
an
light
an
pretty
an
dainty
and
so
forth
and
the
day
the
old
was
in
here
they
said
ruth
would
admire
to
have
things
like
these
how
she
begged
randolph
to
do
up
her
boodore
in
wicker
an
pink
silk
that
what
they
said
oh
well
i
got
a
bug
then
that
the
two
ladies
i
talkin
about
was
just
the
very
oppositest
i
ever
did
see
then
another
thing
was
the
records
the
phonygraft
in
here
is
full
of
light
opery
and
poplar
music
like
that
not
a
smell
o
fugues
and
classic
stuff
an
in
at
schuyler
as
we
seen
there
no
gay
songs
no
comic
operas
no
ragtime
but
terence
i
broke
in
that
all
proves
nothing
the
schuylers
do
care
for
ragtime
and
vicky
van
does
you
must
distort
those
plain
facts
to
fit
your
absurd
theory
yes
he
said
his
eyes
burning
as
they
glared
into
mine
an
schuyler
he
would
never
let
his
wife
go
to
the
light
operas
or
vodyville
an
she
had
any
records
so
how
i
ask
you
comes
it
that
she
so
familiar
with
the
song
about
pearlie
girlie
that
she
joined
in
the
singin
of
it
with
me
at
the
dinner
table
that
what
clinched
it
schuyler
she
knew
that
song
well
as
i
did
and
she
picked
it
up
where
i
left
off
and
hummed
it
straight
to
the
end
words
music
how
she
know
it
i
say
why
she
might
have
picked
that
up
anywhere
she
goes
to
see
friends
i
no
doubt
who
are
not
so
as
the
schuylers
and
they
play
light
tunes
for
her
not
likely
i
run
down
her
friends
and
they
all
old
fogies
like
the
sister
dames
or
like
old
man
schuyler
himself
the
old
ladies
are
nearly
sixty
and
schuyler
was
fifty
odd
and
all
their
friends
are
along
about
those
ages
and
schuyler
she
ai
got
any
friends
of
her
own
age
at
all
but
as
vicky
van
she
has
friends
of
her
own
age
yes
an
her
own
tastes
an
her
own
ways
of
life
livin
an
she
got
the
record
of
pearlie
girlie
it
true
calhoun
said
fleming
stone
i
know
it
all
incredible
but
it
true
i
could
believe
it
myself
when
fibsy
hinted
it
to
me
for
it
his
find
to
him
belongs
all
the
credit
credit
i
groaned
credit
for
fastening
this
lie
this
base
lie
oh
you
are
well
named
fibsy
on
the
best
and
loveliest
woman
that
ever
lived
for
it
is
a
lie
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
a
distorted
notion
of
a
crazy
brain
a
hold
on
calhoun
remonstrated
stone
and
i
dare
say
i
was
acting
like
a
madman
listen
to
the
rest
of
this
more
quietly
or
take
your
hat
and
go
home
stone
spoke
firmly
but
not
angrily
and
i
sat
still
then
here
some
more
things
fibsy
continued
i
gone
over
this
house
with
a
eye
that
sees
stone
lens
an
it
magnerfy
neither
i
spotted
a
lot
of
stuff
in
the
pantry
and
storeroom
it
all
stuff
that
keeps
you
know
little
jugs
an
pots
of
fine
eatin
imported
table
delicacies
that
what
they
call
well
an
among
was
lickures
an
things
like
that
and
boxes
of
candied
rose
leaves
an
salted
nuts
oh
all
them
things
an
why
i
wanted
to
go
to
dinner
at
schuyler
an
see
if
she
liked
to
eat
those
things
an
she
did
she
had
the
rose
leaves
an
she
had
the
kind
o
lickure
that
down
in
the
pantry
cupboard
in
this
house
an
she
said
it
was
her
an
the
old
girls
said
she
never
used
to
have
those
things
when
her
husband
was
runnin
the
house
oh
dear
ca
you
see
it
all
yes
i
see
it
said
stone
but
i
still
shook
my
head
doggedly
and
angrily
i
do
see
it
i
declared
there
nothing
to
all
this
but
a
pipe
dream
why
should
two
women
like
de
vie
de
as
a
liqueur
it
very
fashionable
a
sort
of
fad
just
now
it
ai
only
this
thing
or
that
thing
calhoun
said
fibsy
earnestly
it
the
pilin
up
of
all
an
i
ai
through
yet
here
another
point
miss
van
allen
she
ai
got
any
pitchers
of
nature
views
no
landscapes
nor
woodsy
dells
in
this
whole
house
she
jest
likes
pitchers
of
people
pretty
girls
an
old
cavalier
gentlemen
an
nymps
an
kiddy
babies
but
all
human
you
know
now
schuyler
do
care
anythin
special
for
nature
neither
i
piped
up
about
the
beauty
scenery
out
westchester
way
an
over
in
the
park
an
it
left
her
cold
an
onintrusted
but
she
has
portfolios
of
world
masterpieces
or
whatever
you
call
over
to
that
house
an
they
all
figger
pieces
and
her
writing
desk
prompted
stone
yessir
that
checked
up
too
you
know
calhoun
they
nothin
more
than
a
writin
desk
well
miss
van
allen
has
a
certain
make
of
pen
an
a
certain
number
and
kind
of
pencils
an
schuyler
she
uses
the
same
identical
styles
numbers
and
notepaper
i
suppose
i
flung
back
sarcastically
no
sir
but
that
helps
prove
the
note
paper
in
the
two
houses
is
teetumteetotally
different
that
was
planned
to
be
different
schuyler
is
a
pale
gray
plain
paper
miss
van
allen
is
light
pink
to
match
her
boodore
i
an
it
has
that
sort
of
indented
frame
round
it
that
extry
fashionable
an
a
wiggly
gold
monogram
oh
quite
a
big
one
i
well
remembered
vicky
stationery
and
the
boy
described
it
exactly
proves
nothing
i
said
contemptuously
but
i
listened
further
all
right
fibsy
said
wearily
pushing
back
his
shock
of
red
hair
well
then
how
this
on
schuyler
desk
the
pen
wiper
is
a
fancy
little
contraption
but
it
mean
it
never
had
a
pen
wiped
on
it
miss
van
allen
desk
has
got
any
pen
wiper
on
each
desk
is
a
pencil
sharpener
of
the
same
sort
on
each
desk
is
a
little
pincushion
with
the
same
size
of
tiny
pins
like
she
was
in
the
habit
of
pinnin
bills
together
or
sumpum
like
that
on
each
desk
the
blotter
is
in
the
same
place
and
is
used
the
same
way
there
a
lot
of
pussonality
the
way
folks
use
a
blotter
some
uses
both
sides
some
only
one
side
some
has
their
blotters
all
torn
an
sorta
nibbled
round
the
edges
an
some
has
neat
and
trim
well
the
blotters
on
these
two
desks
is
jest
alike
but
fibsy
i
cried
in
triumph
i
seen
the
handwriting
of
these
two
ladies
over
and
over
again
and
they
not
a
bit
alike
i
know
it
and
fibsy
nodded
but
calhoun
did
you
know
that
miss
van
allen
always
writes
with
her
left
hand
no
and
i
do
believe
she
does
yessir
i
went
to
the
bank
an
they
said
so
an
i
asked
the
woman
an
she
said
so
an
i
asked
the
caterer
people
an
they
said
so
and
the
inkstand
is
on
the
side
of
miss
van
desk
all
right
then
she
is
but
that
proves
nothing
no
sir
miss
van
allen
ai
you
know
she
yourself
you
noticed
it
if
she
had
been
but
she
writes
if
she
did
she
write
like
mrs
schuyler
oh
rubbish
i
began
but
fleming
stone
interrupted
wait
calhoun
do
fly
to
pieces
all
terence
is
saying
is
quite
true
i
vouch
for
it
listen
further
they
ai
no
use
goin
further
said
fibsy
despondently
calhoun
knows
i
right
only
he
ca
bring
himself
to
believe
it
an
i
do
blame
him
why
even
now
he
sizin
up
the
case
everything
he
thinks
of
proves
it
an
nothin
disproves
it
but
anyway
the
prints
prove
it
all
prints
i
said
half
dazedly
yessir
i
photographed
a
lot
o
finger
prints
in
both
houses
an
the
headquarters
people
fixed
up
for
me
magnerfied
you
know
printed
on
little
cards
an
as
you
can
see
they
all
the
same
i
glanced
at
the
sheaf
of
cards
the
boy
had
and
fleming
stone
took
them
to
scrutinize
i
got
those
prints
from
all
sorts
of
places
fibsy
went
on
off
of
the
glass
bottles
and
things
in
the
bathrooms
and
off
of
the
hair
brushes
and
such
things
an
off
of
the
envelopes
of
letters
an
off
the
chairbacks
an
any
polished
wood
surfaces
an
i
got
lots
of
in
both
houses
an
the
police
people
picked
out
the
best
an
cleanest
an
fixed
up
an
there
you
are
they
seemed
to
think
this
settled
the
matter
but
i
would
not
be
convinced
of
course
i
been
told
dozens
of
times
that
no
two
people
in
the
world
have
finger
prints
alike
but
that
did
mean
a
thing
to
me
it
might
be
i
told
them
that
vicky
van
and
ruth
schuyler
were
friends
that
ruth
had
withheld
this
fact
and
that
no
said
stone
not
friends
but
identical
the
same
woman
and
listen
to
this
schuyler
heard
us
say
this
evening
that
fibsy
could
photograph
the
brushes
and
such
things
over
here
to
get
miss
van
allen
finger
prints
and
what
does
she
do
she
sends
tibbetts
over
to
scrub
and
wipe
off
those
same
brushes
also
the
mirrors
chairbacks
and
all
such
possible
evidence
a
hopeless
task
for
the
woman
could
eradicate
all
the
prints
in
the
house
and
also
it
was
too
late
for
fibsy
had
already
done
his
camera
work
how
do
you
know
she
did
all
that
and
i
glowered
at
the
detective
because
fibsy
just
told
me
he
found
evidences
of
this
cleaning
up
and
too
because
schuyler
purposely
kept
us
over
there
longer
than
we
intended
to
stay
you
know
how
when
we
proposed
to
say
she
urged
us
to
stay
longer
that
was
to
give
her
maid
more
time
for
the
work
now
calhoun
go
on
with
your
objections
to
our
conclusions
it
helps
our
theory
to
answer
your
refutations
her
letters
i
mumbled
scarce
able
to
formulate
my
teeming
thoughts
vicky
van
sent
a
letter
to
ruth
schuyler
of
course
she
did
wrote
it
herself
with
her
left
hand
and
mailed
it
to
her
other
personality
in
order
to
make
the
police
give
up
the
search
and
too
the
letter
from
miss
van
allen
found
in
randolph
schuyler
desk
after
his
death
was
written
and
placed
there
by
schuyler
for
us
to
find
impossible
i
cried
i
wo
allow
these
libels
you
be
saying
next
that
ruth
schuyler
killed
her
husband
she
did
asserted
fleming
stone
gravely
she
did
kill
him
in
her
character
as
vicky
van
do
you
see
it
all
schuyler
came
here
as
somers
never
dreaming
that
vicky
van
was
his
own
wife
in
disguise
or
he
may
have
suspected
it
and
may
have
come
to
verify
his
suspicion
any
way
when
she
saw
and
recognized
him
whether
he
knew
her
or
not
she
lured
him
out
to
the
dining
room
and
stabbed
him
with
the
caterer
knife
never
i
said
i
was
not
ranting
now
i
was
stunned
by
the
revelations
that
were
coming
so
thick
and
fast
i
could
believe
and
yet
i
could
doubt
of
one
thing
i
was
certain
i
would
defend
ruth
schuyler
to
the
end
of
time
i
would
defend
her
against
vicky
van
why
if
ruth
was
vicky
van
where
was
this
moil
to
end
i
could
think
coherently
but
i
suddenly
realized
that
what
they
told
me
was
true
i
realized
that
all
along
there
were
things
about
ruth
that
had
reminded
me
of
vicky
i
had
never
put
this
into
words
never
had
really
sensed
it
but
i
saw
now
looking
back
that
they
had
much
in
common
appearance
ah
i
had
yet
thought
of
that
why
i
exclaimed
the
two
are
not
in
the
least
alike
physically
miss
van
allen
wore
a
black
wig
said
stone
a
most
cleverly
constructed
one
and
she
rouged
her
cheeks
penciled
her
eyelashes
and
reddened
her
lips
to
produce
the
high
coloring
that
marked
her
from
mrs
schuyler
i
thought
this
over
dully
yes
they
were
the
same
height
and
weight
they
had
the
same
slight
figure
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
to
compare
their
physical
effects
i
was
a
bit
and
i
had
never
taken
enough
real
personal
interest
in
vicky
to
learn
to
love
her
features
as
i
had
ruth
you
see
fleming
stone
was
saying
though
i
scarce
listened
you
are
the
only
person
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
who
knows
both
miss
van
allen
and
schuyler
no
one
else
has
testified
who
knows
them
both
so
much
depends
on
you
you
get
nothing
from
me
i
fairly
shouted
they
not
the
same
woman
at
all
you
all
wrong
you
and
your
lying
boy
there
your
vehemence
stultifies
your
own
words
said
stone
quietly
it
proves
your
own
realization
of
the
truth
and
your
anger
and
fury
at
that
realization
i
do
blame
you
i
know
your
regard
for
schuyler
i
know
you
have
always
been
a
friend
of
miss
van
allen
it
is
not
strange
that
one
woman
attracts
you
since
the
other
did
but
you
got
to
face
this
thing
so
be
a
man
and
look
at
it
squarely
i
help
you
all
i
can
but
i
assure
you
there
nothing
to
be
gained
by
denial
of
the
truth
but
man
i
said
trying
to
be
calm
the
whole
thing
is
impossible
how
could
randolph
schuyler
a
society
lady
live
a
double
life
and
enact
miss
van
allen
a
gay
butterfly
girl
how
could
she
get
from
one
house
to
the
other
unobserved
why
would
her
servants
know
of
it
even
if
her
family
did
how
could
she
hoodwink
her
husband
her
and
her
friends
why
did
people
see
her
leaving
one
house
and
entering
the
other
why
was
she
missed
from
one
house
when
she
was
in
the
other
all
answerable
questions
said
stone
you
know
miss
van
allen
went
away
frequently
on
long
trips
and
was
in
and
out
of
her
home
all
the
time
here
and
gone
as
every
one
testifies
who
knew
her
this
was
true
enough
vicky
was
never
at
home
more
than
a
few
days
at
a
time
and
then
absent
for
a
week
or
so
where
in
the
fifth
avenue
house
as
ruth
schuyler
incredible
preposterous
but
as
i
began
to
believe
at
last
true
how
i
repeated
how
could
she
manage
walls
have
tongues
said
stone
these
walls
and
this
house
tell
me
all
the
story
that
is
they
tell
me
this
wonderful
woman
did
accomplish
this
seemingly
impossible
thing
they
tell
me
how
she
accomplished
it
but
they
do
not
tell
me
why
there
no
question
about
the
why
i
returned
if
ruth
schuyler
did
live
two
lives
it
easily
understood
why
because
that
brute
of
a
man
allowed
her
no
gayety
no
pleasure
no
fun
of
any
sort
compatible
with
her
youth
and
tastes
he
let
her
do
nothing
have
nothing
save
in
the
old
humdrum
ways
that
appealed
to
his
notion
of
propriety
but
he
himself
was
no
puritan
he
ran
his
own
gait
and
unknown
to
his
wife
and
sisters
he
was
a
roue
and
a
rounder
whatever
ruth
schuyler
may
have
done
she
was
amply
justified
even
in
killing
him
she
did
kill
him
look
here
stone
even
if
all
you
said
is
true
you
have
convicted
her
of
murder
yet
and
you
sha
protect
that
woman
from
the
breath
of
scandal
or
slander
and
what
it
is
when
you
accuse
her
of
killing
that
man
she
never
did
it
that
remains
to
be
seen
and
fleming
stone
deep
gray
eyes
showed
a
sad
apprehension
but
nothing
can
be
done
can
there
terence
no
stone
not
no
by
no
means
not
it
would
do
the
boy
earnestness
seemed
to
me
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
simple
statement
but
i
could
stand
no
more
and
i
went
home
to
spend
the
night
in
a
dazed
wonder
a
furious
disbelief
and
finally
an
enforced
conviction
that
vicky
van
and
ruth
schuyler
were
one
and
the
same
chapter
xx
the
truth
from
ruth
next
morning
i
was
conscious
of
but
one
desire
to
get
to
ruth
and
tell
her
of
my
love
and
faith
in
her
and
assure
her
of
my
protection
and
assistance
whatever
happened
whatever
happened
the
thought
struck
me
like
a
knell
what
could
happen
but
her
arrest
and
trial
but
as
i
went
out
of
my
own
door
i
left
the
house
early
for
i
could
face
aunt
lucy
and
winnie
i
suddenly
decided
it
would
be
better
to
see
stone
first
and
learn
if
anything
had
transpired
since
i
left
him
i
rang
the
bell
at
vicky
van
house
with
a
terrible
feeling
of
impending
disaster
that
might
be
worse
than
any
yet
known
fibsy
let
me
in
i
wanted
to
hate
that
boy
and
yet
his
very
evident
adoration
of
ruth
schuyler
made
me
love
him
i
knew
all
that
he
had
discovered
had
been
as
iron
entering
his
soul
but
his
duty
led
him
on
and
he
dared
not
pause
or
falter
we
may
as
well
tell
him
he
said
to
stone
and
the
detective
nodded
but
come
downstairs
with
us
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
first
stone
said
you
need
it
as
you
say
you
had
no
breakfast
fibsy
makes
coffee
and
i
can
tell
you
calhoun
you
a
hard
day
before
you
have
you
learned
anything
further
i
managed
to
stammer
out
as
we
went
down
to
the
basement
room
that
they
used
as
a
now
yes
as
i
told
you
walls
have
tongues
and
the
walls
have
given
up
the
secret
of
how
schuyler
managed
her
existence
but
he
would
not
tell
me
the
secret
until
i
had
been
fortified
with
two
cups
of
steaming
mocha
which
fully
justified
his
praise
of
fibsy
culinary
prowess
fibsy
himself
said
nothing
beyond
a
brief
good
morning
and
the
lad
eyes
were
red
and
his
voice
shook
as
he
spoke
i
knew
stone
said
as
we
finished
breakfast
that
there
must
be
some
means
some
secret
means
of
communication
between
the
two
houses
the
schuyler
house
and
this
you
see
the
schuyler
house
fronting
on
fifth
avenue
three
doors
from
the
corner
runs
back
a
hundred
feet
and
abuts
on
the
rear
rooms
of
this
house
which
runs
back
from
the
side
street
in
a
word
the
two
houses
form
a
right
angle
and
the
back
wall
of
the
schuyler
house
is
directly
against
the
side
wall
of
the
rear
rooms
of
this
house
therefore
i
felt
sure
there
must
be
an
entrance
from
one
house
to
the
other
not
perceivable
to
an
observer
and
of
course
it
must
be
in
schuyler
own
rooms
it
be
in
their
or
halls
a
few
questions
made
me
realize
that
miss
van
allen
boudoir
was
separated
from
schuyler
bath
room
by
only
the
partition
wall
of
the
houses
and
i
said
that
wall
must
speak
to
me
and
it
did
we
were
now
on
our
way
upstairs
stone
ready
at
last
to
let
me
into
the
secret
he
had
discovered
we
went
to
vicky
boudoir
and
he
continued
you
know
you
found
the
strand
of
gilt
beads
caught
in
this
mirror
frame
we
all
assumed
miss
van
allen
had
flirted
it
there
as
she
dressed
for
her
party
but
i
reasoned
that
it
might
have
caught
there
as
she
escaped
to
the
schuyler
house
the
night
of
the
murder
yes
she
did
escape
this
way
look
stone
touched
a
hidden
spring
and
the
mirror
in
the
florentine
frame
slid
silently
aside
into
the
wall
leaving
an
aperture
that
without
doubt
led
into
the
next
house
the
frame
remained
stationary
but
the
mirror
slid
away
as
a
sliding
door
works
and
so
smoothly
that
there
was
absolutely
no
sound
or
jar
i
saw
what
was
like
a
small
closet
about
two
feet
deep
and
perhaps
three
feet
wide
at
the
back
of
it
that
is
against
the
walls
of
the
adjoining
room
in
the
other
house
we
could
see
the
shape
of
a
similar
door
and
the
secret
was
out
there
was
no
need
to
open
that
other
door
to
know
that
it
led
to
ruth
schuyler
rooms
there
was
yet
more
telltale
evidence
in
the
little
cupboard
between
the
houses
was
a
small
safe
this
stone
had
opened
and
in
it
was
the
black
wig
of
vicky
van
and
also
a
brown
wig
which
i
recognized
at
once
as
plainly
parted
front
hair
you
see
tibbetts
is
julie
said
fibsy
in
such
a
and
despairing
voice
that
i
felt
the
tears
rush
to
my
own
eyes
vicky
wig
the
loops
of
sleek
black
hair
the
soft
loose
knot
behind
the
delicate
part
all
just
as
it
crowned
her
little
head
ruth
head
oh
i
could
stand
it
it
was
too
fearful
this
other
door
stone
said
opens
into
schuyler
bathroom
that
i
know
you
see
she
had
to
have
this
entrance
from
some
room
absolutely
her
own
her
bathroom
was
safe
from
interruption
and
when
she
chose
she
slipped
through
from
one
house
to
the
other
and
back
at
will
no
i
ca
understand
it
i
insisted
shaking
my
head
if
she
came
in
here
as
ruth
schuyler
why
was
she
seen
because
before
she
was
seen
she
had
made
herself
over
into
victoria
van
allen
she
had
donned
wig
and
safe
from
interruption
here
in
her
boudoir
this
she
removed
before
returning
to
the
schuyler
house
in
her
role
of
mrs
schuyler
it
is
too
unbelievable
no
it
is
diabolically
clever
but
quite
understandable
julie
and
tibbetts
are
the
same
this
confidential
woman
looked
after
her
mistress
safety
on
both
sides
she
remained
when
vicky
van
disappeared
she
looked
after
everything
took
care
of
details
attended
to
tradesmen
and
all
such
matters
and
when
ready
followed
schuyler
into
the
other
house
or
went
from
here
to
her
rooms
a
few
blocks
away
and
later
came
from
them
when
there
were
to
be
parties
julie
left
the
schuyler
house
early
came
here
and
made
preparations
and
then
as
late
as
ten
or
eleven
maybe
schuyler
came
in
from
her
home
when
her
own
household
thought
her
abed
and
asleep
she
could
go
back
in
the
early
morning
hours
with
no
one
the
wiser
or
if
she
chose
and
she
did
when
her
husband
was
out
of
town
she
could
pretend
she
had
gone
away
for
a
visit
and
stay
here
for
days
at
a
time
i
began
to
see
truly
the
wall
tongue
had
spoken
if
this
awful
theory
of
stone
were
true
it
could
only
be
managed
in
this
way
i
remembered
how
long
and
how
often
vicky
van
was
absent
from
her
home
i
remembered
that
sometimes
she
was
late
in
arriving
at
her
own
parties
although
she
always
came
down
from
upstairs
in
her
party
regalia
how
did
you
come
to
suspect
tibbetts
i
asked
suddenly
her
teeth
said
fibsy
i
saw
that
tibbetts
had
false
teeth
anyway
an
i
says
why
ca
julie
gold
teeth
be
false
too
and
they
are
they
in
the
safe
what
marvelous
precautions
they
had
taken
to
think
of
having
a
set
of
teeth
for
the
maid
julie
that
should
appear
so
different
from
those
of
tibbetts
surely
this
thing
was
the
result
of
long
and
careful
planning
her
glasses
too
went
on
fibsy
you
see
they
made
her
different
from
tibbetts
in
appearance
that
was
all
the
disguise
tibbs
had
the
gold
teeth
the
big
rimmed
specs
and
the
brown
scratch
wig
you
know
but
it
was
enough
nobody
notices
a
servant
closely
and
these
things
altered
her
looks
sufficient
miss
van
allen
now
she
had
a
wig
an
a
lot
of
colorin
matter
an
her
giddy
clothes
nothin
left
to
reckernize
but
her
eyes
an
they
were
so
darkened
by
the
long
dark
lashes
and
brows
that
she
fixed
up
that
it
made
her
eyes
seem
darker
i
got
all
this
from
the
pitchers
the
artist
lady
made
you
see
she
caught
the
color
likeness
but
not
the
actual
features
so
i
sized
up
the
resemblance
of
the
real
women
oh
stone
what
are
we
going
to
do
our
duty
terence
then
i
put
forth
my
plea
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
go
and
see
ruth
first
that
i
might
prepare
her
for
the
disclosures
they
would
make
the
discoveries
they
would
announce
but
stone
denied
me
he
said
they
would
do
or
say
nothing
that
would
unnecessarily
hurt
her
feelings
but
they
must
accompany
me
indeed
he
implied
that
it
might
be
as
well
for
me
not
to
go
but
i
insisted
on
going
and
we
three
went
on
our
terrible
errand
ruth
received
us
in
the
library
she
saw
at
once
that
her
secret
was
known
and
she
took
it
calmly
you
know
she
said
quietly
to
stone
i
am
sorry
i
hoped
to
hide
my
secret
and
let
victoria
van
allen
forever
remain
a
mystery
but
it
can
not
be
i
admit
all
wait
ruth
i
cried
out
admit
nothing
until
you
are
accused
i
am
accused
she
responded
with
a
sad
smile
i
heard
you
talking
in
the
passage
between
the
rooms
in
my
bathroom
i
could
hear
you
distinctly
there
is
there
a
mirror
door
also
it
looks
like
an
ordinary
mirror
and
has
a
wide
flat
nickel
frame
matching
the
other
fittings
yes
i
had
the
sliding
doors
built
for
the
purposes
which
you
have
surmised
shall
i
tell
you
my
story
yes
and
let
us
hear
it
too
came
from
the
doorway
and
the
two
sisters
appeared
agog
with
excitement
and
curiosity
come
in
said
ruth
quietly
sit
down
please
i
want
you
to
hear
it
most
of
it
you
know
sarah
and
rhoda
but
i
will
tell
it
briefly
to
stone
for
i
want
not
leniency
but
justice
i
seated
myself
at
ruth
side
and
though
i
said
no
word
i
knew
that
she
understood
that
my
heart
and
life
were
at
her
disposal
and
that
whatever
she
might
be
about
to
tell
would
not
shake
my
love
and
devotion
it
is
not
necessary
to
use
words
when
a
life
crisis
occurs
i
was
an
orphan
ruth
said
brought
up
by
a
stern
and
puritanical
old
aunt
in
new
england
i
had
no
joy
or
pleasures
in
my
childhood
or
girlhood
days
i
ran
away
from
home
to
become
an
actress
tibbetts
my
old
nurse
who
lived
in
the
same
village
followed
me
to
keep
an
eye
on
me
and
protect
me
in
need
i
was
a
chorus
girl
for
just
one
week
when
randolph
schuyler
discovered
me
and
offered
to
marry
me
if
i
would
renounce
the
stage
and
also
gay
life
of
any
sort
and
become
a
dignified
matron
i
willingly
accepted
i
was
only
seventeen
and
knew
nothing
of
the
world
or
its
ways
as
soon
as
we
were
married
he
forbade
me
any
sort
of
amusement
or
pleasure
other
than
those
practised
by
his
elderly
sisters
i
submitted
and
lived
a
life
of
slavery
to
his
whims
and
his
cruelty
for
five
years
he
had
agreed
to
let
me
have
tibbetts
for
my
maid
as
he
deemed
her
a
staid
old
woman
who
would
not
encourage
me
in
wayward
desires
nor
did
she
but
she
realized
my
thraldom
my
lonely
unhappy
life
and
knew
that
i
was
pining
away
for
want
of
the
simple
innocent
pleasures
that
my
youth
and
nature
craved
i
used
to
beg
and
plead
for
permission
to
have
a
few
young
friends
or
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
a
few
parties
or
plays
but
schuyler
kept
me
as
secluded
as
any
woman
in
a
harem
he
gave
me
no
liberty
no
freedom
in
the
slightest
degree
i
had
been
married
about
four
years
when
i
rebelled
and
began
to
think
up
a
scheme
of
a
dual
existence
i
had
ample
time
in
the
long
lonely
hours
to
perfect
my
plans
and
i
had
them
arranged
to
the
minutest
detail
long
before
i
put
them
in
operation
why
i
practised
writing
with
my
left
hand
and
acquired
a
different
speaking
voice
for
a
year
before
i
needed
such
subterfuges
had
i
been
able
to
persuade
my
husband
to
give
me
even
a
little
pleasure
or
happiness
i
would
willingly
have
given
up
my
wild
scheme
but
he
would
so
once
when
he
was
away
on
a
long
trip
i
had
the
passage
between
the
two
houses
made
i
had
previously
bought
the
other
house
under
the
name
of
van
allen
for
i
had
money
of
my
own
left
me
by
an
uncle
that
schuyler
knew
nothing
about
of
course
this
money
came
to
me
after
i
was
married
or
i
never
should
have
wed
randolph
schuyler
tibbetts
cousin
an
expert
carpenter
did
the
work
and
as
he
afterward
went
to
england
to
live
i
had
no
fear
of
discovery
that
way
indeed
there
was
little
fear
of
discovery
in
any
way
i
was
expected
to
spend
much
of
my
time
in
my
own
rooms
and
my
bedroom
dressing
room
and
bath
form
a
little
suite
by
themselves
and
can
be
locked
off
from
the
rest
of
the
house
so
when
i
retired
to
my
rooms
for
the
night
i
could
go
through
into
the
other
house
and
become
vicky
van
at
my
pleasure
i
ca
believe
such
baseness
declared
rhoda
schuyler
such
ingratitude
to
a
husband
who
was
so
good
to
you
he
was
good
to
me
said
ruth
quietly
nor
was
i
ungrateful
randolph
schuyler
spoiled
my
life
he
denied
me
everything
i
asked
for
every
innocent
pleasure
and
amusement
so
i
found
them
for
myself
i
did
nothing
wrong
as
victoria
van
allen
i
had
friends
and
pleasures
that
suited
my
age
and
my
love
of
life
but
there
never
was
anything
wrong
or
guilty
in
my
house
until
you
killed
your
husband
interrupted
sarah
until
the
night
of
randolph
schuyler
appearance
at
vicky
house
ruth
went
on
i
had
been
told
of
a
somers
who
wanted
to
know
me
but
i
had
no
idea
it
was
my
husband
masquerading
under
a
false
name
he
came
there
with
steele
of
course
i
recognized
him
but
he
did
not
know
me
at
once
i
sat
playing
bridge
and
wondering
how
i
could
best
make
my
escape
i
saw
that
he
did
know
me
and
then
suddenly
as
i
sat
holding
my
cards
and
he
stood
beside
me
he
noticed
a
tiny
scar
on
my
shoulder
he
made
that
scar
himself
one
night
when
he
hit
me
with
a
hot
curling
iron
what
i
cried
unable
to
repress
an
exclamation
of
horror
yes
i
was
curling
my
hair
with
the
tongs
and
he
became
angry
at
me
for
some
trivial
reason
as
he
often
did
and
he
snatched
up
the
iron
and
hit
my
shoulder
it
made
a
deep
burn
and
he
was
very
sorry
whenever
he
saw
it
afterward
he
said
again
meaning
he
would
never
strike
me
again
then
when
he
noticed
the
scar
that
night
although
i
had
put
on
a
light
scarf
to
cover
it
he
said
again
in
that
peculiar
intonation
and
i
knew
then
that
he
knew
victoria
van
allen
was
his
own
wife
i
ran
out
to
the
and
he
followed
me
and
you
stabbed
him
cried
rhoda
stabbed
your
husband
murderess
i
do
deny
it
said
ruth
slowly
the
jury
must
decide
that
i
must
be
tried
i
suppose
do
ruth
i
cried
in
agony
do
talk
like
that
you
shall
not
be
tried
you
did
kill
schuyler
if
you
did
it
was
in
was
it
did
he
try
to
kill
you
yes
he
did
he
snatched
the
little
carver
from
the
sideboard
and
attacked
me
and
i
and
i
do
say
it
ruth
keep
still
i
ordered
beside
myself
with
my
whirling
thoughts
the
little
and
you
defended
yourself
with
the
caterer
knife
began
stone
but
fibsy
wailed
no
no
it
was
schuyler
i
got
the
prints
from
the
caterer
knife
and
they
ai
schuyler
at
all
she
did
kill
him
no
she
did
and
tibbetts
appeared
in
the
library
doorway
i
did
it
myself
that
right
and
fibsy
eyes
gleamed
satisfaction
she
did
her
fingermarks
on
the
knife
that
stabbed
old
schuyler
they
plain
as
print
nobody
thought
of
matching
up
those
marks
with
mitt
but
i
bet
she
did
it
to
save
schuyler
life
i
did
and
tibbetts
came
into
the
room
and
stood
facing
us
tell
your
story
said
stone
abruptly
as
he
looked
at
the
woman
here
it
is
and
tibbetts
looked
fondly
at
ruth
as
the
piteous
glance
met
hers
i
loved
and
watched
over
schuyler
all
her
life
i
protected
her
from
her
husband
brutality
and
helped
her
to
bear
his
cruelty
and
unkindness
when
she
conceived
the
plan
of
the
double
life
i
helped
her
all
i
could
and
i
got
my
cousin
to
do
the
work
on
the
houses
that
made
it
all
possible
then
i
was
julie
and
i
devoted
my
life
and
energies
to
keeping
the
secret
and
allowing
my
mistress
to
have
some
pleasure
out
of
her
life
and
she
did
tibbets
looked
affectionately
even
proudly
at
ruth
the
hours
she
spent
in
that
house
as
victoria
van
allen
were
full
of
simple
joys
and
happy
occupation
she
had
the
books
and
pictures
and
furniture
that
she
craved
she
had
things
to
eat
and
things
to
wear
that
she
wanted
she
went
to
parties
and
she
had
parties
she
went
to
the
theatre
and
to
the
shops
and
wherever
she
chose
without
let
or
hindrance
it
did
my
heart
good
to
see
her
enjoy
herself
in
those
innocent
ways
then
schuyler
came
i
knew
the
man
i
knew
that
he
came
because
he
had
heard
of
the
charm
and
beauty
of
vicky
van
he
had
no
idea
he
would
find
her
his
own
wife
when
he
did
discover
it
i
knew
he
would
kill
her
oh
i
knew
randolph
schuyler
i
knew
nothing
short
of
murder
would
satisfy
the
rage
that
possessed
him
at
the
discovery
i
prepared
for
it
i
got
the
little
from
the
pantry
and
as
schuyler
lifted
the
carver
and
aimed
it
at
ruth
breast
i
drove
the
little
knife
into
his
vile
wicked
murderer
heart
and
glad
i
did
it
i
glory
in
it
i
saved
ruth
life
and
i
rid
the
world
of
a
scoundrel
and
a
villain
who
had
no
right
to
live
and
breathe
on
god
earth
now
you
may
take
me
and
do
with
me
as
you
will
i
give
myself
up
it
was
the
truth
on
the
appeared
plain
as
print
the
finger
marks
of
randolph
schuyler
proved
a
hundred
times
by
prints
photographed
from
his
own
letters
toilet
articles
and
personal
belongings
in
his
own
rooms
in
his
mad
fury
at
the
discovery
of
ruth
masquerading
as
vicky
van
and
in
his
sudden
realization
of
all
that
it
meant
he
clutched
the
first
weapon
he
saw
the
little
carver
to
end
her
life
and
gratify
his
madness
for
revenge
just
in
time
the
watching
tibbets
had
intervened
stabbed
schuyler
and
then
ran
upstairs
to
escape
through
the
hidden
doors
to
the
other
house
ruth
stunned
at
the
sight
of
the
blow
driven
by
tibbetts
and
dazed
by
her
own
narrow
escape
from
a
fearful
death
picked
up
the
carver
that
dropped
from
schuyler
lifeless
hand
and
ran
upstairs
too
she
had
she
explained
afterward
a
hazy
idea
that
she
was
picking
up
the
knife
that
tibbetts
had
used
so
bewildered
was
she
at
the
swift
turn
of
events
and
as
she
stooped
over
schuyler
in
her
frenzy
the
waiter
had
seen
her
and
assumed
she
was
the
murderer
this
too
explained
the
blood
on
the
flounces
of
her
gown
it
had
brushed
the
fallen
figure
of
her
husband
and
became
stained
at
the
touch
the
two
women
had
of
course
slipped
through
the
connecting
mirror
doors
into
the
schuyler
house
and
long
before
the
alarm
was
brought
there
they
were
rehabilitated
and
ready
to
receive
the
news
then
ruth
quandary
was
a
serious
one
innocent
herself
she
could
not
tell
of
her
double
life
without
making
the
whole
affair
public
and
incriminating
tibbetts
whom
she
loved
almost
as
a
mother
and
who
had
saved
ruth
life
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
an
instant
delay
and
schuyler
knife
would
have
been
driven
into
ruth
heart
so
for
tibbetts
sake
ruth
perforce
kept
the
secret
of
vicky
van
i
was
not
ashamed
of
it
she
told
us
frankly
there
was
nothing
really
wrong
in
my
living
two
lives
my
husband
denied
me
the
pleasure
and
joy
that
life
owed
me
so
i
found
it
for
myself
i
never
had
a
friend
or
committed
a
deed
or
said
a
word
as
victoria
van
allen
that
all
the
world
might
hear
or
know
of
and
i
should
have
owned
up
to
the
whole
scheme
at
once
except
that
it
would
bring
out
the
knowledge
of
tibbetts
act
i
wished
not
to
go
back
to
the
other
house
at
all
and
should
not
have
done
so
for
myself
but
i
had
reasons
connected
with
other
people
a
friend
whom
i
love
had
asked
the
privilege
of
having
certain
letters
sent
her
in
my
care
that
is
in
care
of
miss
van
allen
and
i
had
to
go
in
once
or
twice
to
rescue
those
and
so
prevent
a
scandal
that
would
ensue
upon
their
discovery
for
her
sake
i
risked
going
back
there
at
night
also
i
wanted
my
address
book
for
it
has
in
it
many
addresses
of
people
who
are
my
charity
beneficiaries
schuyler
never
allowed
me
to
contribute
to
any
charitable
cause
and
i
have
enjoyed
giving
help
to
some
who
need
and
deserve
it
these
addresses
i
had
to
have
and
i
have
them
stone
was
right
the
walls
had
tongues
he
first
noticed
a
little
defect
in
the
green
paint
in
the
living
room
which
i
had
retouched
winnie
told
me
of
this
and
i
realized
how
clever
stone
is
so
i
threw
away
the
paint
i
had
used
which
was
in
here
and
i
carefully
thought
out
what
else
was
incriminating
and
removed
all
i
could
from
the
other
house
fibsy
noticed
when
i
took
a
book
from
a
table
but
that
book
i
wanted
because
she
blushed
because
calhoun
had
given
it
to
me
and
i
was
sure
i
could
get
it
any
other
way
but
the
walls
told
all
and
at
the
last
i
knew
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
when
stone
or
terence
would
discover
the
doors
i
suppose
the
strand
of
beads
that
caught
as
i
escaped
that
night
gave
a
hint
but
they
would
have
found
them
anyway
they
are
wonderful
doors
in
their
working
i
mean
no
complicated
mechanism
but
merely
so
well
made
and
adjusted
that
a
touch
opens
or
closes
them
and
absolutely
silently
no
one
in
this
house
ever
dreamed
the
bathroom
mirror
was
anything
but
a
mirror
and
in
the
other
house
the
elaborate
florentine
frame
precluded
all
idea
of
a
secret
contrivance
the
two
feet
of
thickness
of
the
house
walls
made
a
tiny
cupboard
where
i
had
that
small
safe
installed
that
we
might
put
our
wigs
and
such
definitely
incriminating
bits
of
evidence
in
hiding
also
vicky
jewelry
but
i
always
changed
my
costumes
from
one
character
to
the
other
in
vicky
van
and
so
ran
little
or
no
chance
of
discovery
in
a
futile
endeavor
to
distract
attention
from
victoria
van
allen
i
wrote
a
note
to
ruth
schuyler
and
also
wrote
the
one
found
in
schuyler
desk
i
did
these
things
in
hopes
that
the
detectives
would
cease
to
watch
for
the
return
of
miss
van
allen
but
it
turned
out
differently
i
assumed
of
course
if
search
could
be
diverted
from
that
house
into
other
channels
there
would
be
a
possibility
of
tibbetts
never
being
suspected
i
am
sorry
she
has
confessed
i
do
not
want
her
to
be
tried
she
saved
my
life
and
i
would
do
anything
to
keep
her
from
harm
but
tibbetts
was
tried
and
was
acquitted
a
just
jury
knowing
all
of
the
facts
declared
it
was
a
case
of
justifiable
homicide
and
the
verdict
was
not
guilty
the
schuyler
sisters
were
finally
convinced
that
ruth
life
had
been
endangered
by
their
brother
rage
and
though
they
condemned
tibbetts
in
their
hearts
they
said
little
in
the
face
of
public
opinion
as
for
me
i
could
wait
until
a
conventional
time
had
elapsed
before
telling
my
darling
of
my
love
for
her
own
sweet
self
and
as
i
now
realized
for
vicky
van
also
i
spent
hours
listening
to
the
details
of
her
double
life
of
the
narrow
escapes
from
discovery
and
the
frequent
occasions
of
danger
to
her
scheme
but
tibbetts
watchful
eyes
and
ruth
own
cleverness
had
made
the
plan
feasible
for
two
years
and
it
was
only
because
ruth
had
found
her
dear
heart
was
inclining
too
greatly
toward
me
that
she
had
begun
to
think
it
her
duty
to
give
up
her
double
life
she
had
recently
decided
to
do
so
for
she
was
not
willing
to
let
our
mutual
interest
ripen
into
love
while
she
was
the
wife
of
another
man
and
so
if
it
had
all
happened
just
as
it
did
i
should
never
have
won
my
darling
for
she
was
about
to
give
up
the
van
allen
house
and
i
never
should
have
had
occasion
to
meet
randolph
schuyler
it
is
all
past
history
now
and
ruth
and
i
are
striving
to
forget
even
the
memories
of
it
we
live
in
another
city
and
tibbetts
is
our
faithful
and
beloved
housekeeper
and
often
ruth
says
to
me
i
know
you
love
me
chet
but
sometimes
i
ca
help
feeling
a
little
jealous
of
the
girl
you
cared
for
that
what
her
name
oh
yes
vicky
van
vicky
van
was
all
right
i
stoutly
maintain
i
never
knew
a
more
charming
sweeter
prettier
dearer
little
girl
than
vicky
but
she
was
awfully
made
up
yes
that
where
you
score
an
advantage
the
only
thing
about
vicky
i
disapproved
of
was
her
paint
and
powder
thank
heaven
my
wife
has
a
complexion
that
all
her
own
and
i
kissed
the
soft
pale
cheek
of
my
own
ruth
