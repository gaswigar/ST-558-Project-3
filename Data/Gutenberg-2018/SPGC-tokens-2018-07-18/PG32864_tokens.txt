broken
helpless
she
had
to
trust
an
alien
doctor
to
give
her
back
her
body
and
mind
a
doctor
who
had
never
seen
a
human
before
she
awoke
and
did
even
wonder
where
she
was
first
there
were
feelings
a
feeling
of
existence
a
sense
of
still
being
alive
when
she
should
be
dead
an
awareness
of
pain
that
made
her
body
its
playground
after
that
there
came
a
thought
it
was
a
simple
thought
and
her
mind
blurted
it
out
before
she
could
stop
it
god
now
i
wo
even
be
plain
any
more
i
be
the
thought
sent
a
wave
of
panic
coursing
through
her
but
she
was
too
tired
to
experience
any
emotion
for
long
and
she
soon
drowsed
off
later
the
second
time
she
awoke
she
wondered
where
she
was
there
was
no
way
of
telling
around
her
all
was
black
and
quiet
the
blackness
was
solid
the
quiet
absolute
she
was
aware
of
pain
again
not
sharp
pain
this
time
but
dull
spread
throughout
her
body
her
legs
ached
so
did
her
arms
she
tried
to
lift
them
and
found
to
her
surprise
that
they
did
not
respond
she
tried
to
flex
her
fingers
and
failed
she
was
paralyzed
she
could
not
move
a
muscle
of
her
body
the
silence
was
so
complete
that
it
was
frightening
not
a
whisper
of
sound
reached
her
she
had
been
on
a
spaceship
but
none
of
a
noises
came
to
her
now
not
the
creak
of
an
expanding
joint
nor
the
occasional
slap
of
metal
on
metal
not
the
sound
of
fred
voice
nor
even
the
slow
rhythm
of
her
own
breathing
it
took
her
a
full
minute
to
figure
out
why
and
when
she
had
done
so
she
did
not
believe
it
but
the
thought
persisted
and
soon
she
knew
that
it
was
true
the
silence
was
complete
because
she
was
deaf
another
thought
the
blackness
was
so
deep
because
she
was
blind
and
still
another
this
time
a
questioning
one
why
if
she
could
feel
pain
in
her
arms
and
legs
could
she
not
move
them
what
strange
form
of
paralysis
was
this
she
fought
against
the
answer
but
slowly
inescapably
it
formed
in
her
mind
she
was
not
paralyzed
at
all
she
could
not
move
her
arms
and
legs
because
she
had
none
the
pains
she
felt
were
phantom
pains
conveyed
by
the
nerve
endings
without
an
external
stimulus
when
this
thought
penetrated
she
fainted
her
mind
sought
in
unconsciousness
to
get
as
close
to
death
as
it
could
when
she
awoke
it
was
against
her
will
she
sought
desperately
to
close
her
mind
against
thought
and
feeling
just
as
her
eyes
and
ears
were
already
closed
illustration
but
thoughts
crept
in
despite
her
why
was
she
alive
why
had
she
died
in
the
crash
fred
must
certainly
have
been
killed
the
asteroid
had
come
into
view
suddenly
there
had
been
no
chance
of
avoiding
it
it
had
been
a
miracle
that
she
herself
had
escaped
if
escape
it
could
be
called
a
mere
sightless
armless
and
legless
torso
with
no
means
of
communication
with
the
outside
world
she
was
more
dead
than
alive
and
she
could
not
believe
that
the
miracle
had
been
repeated
with
fred
it
was
better
that
way
fred
would
have
to
look
at
her
and
shudder
and
he
would
have
to
worry
about
himself
either
he
had
always
been
a
handsome
man
and
it
would
have
killed
him
a
second
time
to
find
himself
maimed
and
horrible
she
must
find
a
way
to
join
him
to
kill
herself
it
would
be
difficult
no
doubt
without
arms
or
legs
without
any
way
of
knowing
her
surroundings
but
sooner
or
later
she
would
think
of
a
way
she
had
heard
somewhere
of
people
strangling
themselves
by
swallowing
their
own
tongues
and
the
thought
cheered
her
she
could
at
least
try
that
right
now
she
could
no
she
could
she
had
realized
it
before
but
she
had
no
tongue
she
did
black
out
at
this
sudden
awareness
of
a
new
horror
although
she
desperately
wanted
to
she
thought
can
make
an
effort
of
will
i
can
force
myself
to
die
die
you
fool
you
helpless
lump
of
flesh
die
and
end
your
torture
die
die
die
but
she
did
and
after
a
while
a
new
thought
came
to
her
she
and
fred
had
been
the
only
ones
on
their
ship
there
had
been
no
other
ship
near
them
who
had
kept
her
from
dying
who
had
taken
her
crushed
body
and
stopped
the
flow
of
blood
and
tended
her
wounds
and
kept
her
alive
and
for
what
purpose
the
silence
gave
no
answer
nor
did
her
own
mind
after
an
age
she
slept
again
when
she
awoke
a
voice
said
do
you
feel
better
i
she
shouted
to
herself
a
strange
voice
a
most
unusual
accent
i
could
possibly
have
imagined
it
i
not
deaf
maybe
i
not
blind
either
maybe
i
just
had
a
i
know
that
you
can
not
answer
but
do
not
fear
you
will
soon
be
able
to
speak
again
who
was
it
not
a
man
voice
nor
a
woman
it
was
curiously
hoarse
and
yet
clear
enough
uninflected
and
yet
pleasant
a
doctor
where
could
a
doctor
have
come
from
your
husband
is
also
alive
fortunately
we
reached
both
of
you
at
about
the
time
death
had
just
begun
fortunately
she
felt
a
flash
of
rage
should
have
let
us
die
it
would
be
bad
enough
to
be
alive
by
myself
a
helpless
cripple
dependent
upon
others
but
to
know
that
fred
is
alive
too
is
worse
to
know
that
he
has
a
picture
of
me
like
this
ugly
and
horrifying
is
more
than
i
can
stand
with
any
other
man
it
would
be
bad
enough
but
with
fred
unendurable
give
me
back
the
ability
to
talk
and
the
first
thing
ask
of
you
is
to
kill
me
i
do
want
to
it
may
reassure
you
to
know
that
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
recovering
the
use
of
the
limbs
proper
to
you
and
the
organs
of
sensation
it
will
take
time
but
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
final
outcome
what
nonsense
she
asked
herself
was
this
doctors
had
done
wonders
in
the
creation
and
fitting
of
artificial
arms
and
legs
but
he
seemed
to
be
promising
her
the
use
of
limbs
and
he
had
said
organs
of
sensation
that
did
sound
as
if
he
meant
that
she
see
and
hear
electronically
it
meant
nonsense
he
was
making
a
promise
he
could
keep
he
was
just
saying
that
to
make
her
feel
better
the
way
doctors
did
he
was
saying
it
to
give
her
courage
keep
her
morale
up
make
her
feel
that
it
was
worth
fighting
but
it
worth
fighting
she
had
no
courage
to
keep
up
she
wanted
only
to
die
perhaps
you
have
already
realized
that
i
am
not
what
you
would
call
human
however
i
suggest
that
you
do
not
worry
too
much
about
that
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
reconstructing
you
properly
according
to
your
own
standards
then
the
voice
ceased
and
she
was
left
alone
it
was
just
as
well
she
thought
he
had
said
too
much
and
she
could
answer
nor
ask
questions
of
her
own
and
she
had
so
many
he
was
human
then
what
was
he
and
how
did
he
come
to
speak
a
human
language
and
what
did
he
mean
to
do
with
her
after
he
had
reconstructed
her
and
what
would
she
look
like
after
she
was
reconstructed
there
were
races
she
knew
that
had
no
sense
of
beauty
or
if
they
had
one
it
was
like
a
human
sense
of
beauty
would
he
consider
her
properly
reconstructed
if
he
gave
her
the
right
number
of
arms
and
legs
and
artificial
organs
of
sight
that
acted
like
eyes
and
made
her
look
like
some
creature
out
of
hell
would
he
be
proud
of
his
handiwork
as
human
doctors
had
been
known
to
be
when
their
patients
ended
up
alive
and
helpless
their
bodies
scarred
their
organs
functioning
feebly
and
imperfectly
would
he
turn
her
into
something
that
fred
would
look
at
with
abhorrence
and
disgust
fred
had
always
been
a
little
too
sensitive
to
beauty
in
women
he
had
been
able
to
pick
and
choose
at
his
will
and
until
he
had
met
her
he
had
always
chosen
on
the
basis
of
looks
alone
she
had
never
understood
why
he
had
married
her
perhaps
the
fact
that
she
was
the
one
woman
he
knew
who
beautiful
had
made
her
stand
out
perhaps
too
she
told
herself
there
was
a
touch
of
cruelty
in
his
choice
he
might
have
wanted
someone
who
was
too
sure
of
herself
someone
he
could
count
on
under
all
circumstances
she
remembered
how
people
had
used
to
stare
at
them
the
handsome
man
and
the
plain
woman
and
then
whisper
among
themselves
wondering
openly
how
he
had
ever
come
to
marry
her
fred
had
liked
that
she
was
sure
he
had
liked
that
he
had
obviously
a
plain
wife
now
he
would
have
an
ugly
one
would
he
want
she
slept
on
her
questions
and
waked
and
slept
repeatedly
and
then
one
day
she
heard
the
voice
again
and
to
her
surprise
she
found
that
she
could
answer
back
slowly
uncertainly
at
times
painfully
but
she
could
speak
once
more
we
have
been
working
on
you
said
the
voice
you
are
coming
along
nicely
am
i
am
i
she
found
difficulty
asking
how
do
i
look
incomplete
i
must
be
horrible
a
slight
pause
no
not
horrible
at
all
not
to
me
merely
incomplete
my
husband
would
think
so
i
do
not
know
what
your
husband
would
think
perhaps
he
is
not
used
to
seeing
incomplete
persons
he
might
even
be
horrified
at
the
sight
of
himself
i
i
had
thought
of
that
but
he
we
both
be
all
right
as
a
medical
problem
you
offer
no
insuperable
difficulty
none
at
all
why
why
do
you
give
me
eyes
if
you
can
are
you
afraid
afraid
that
i
might
see
you
and
find
you
terrifying
again
a
pause
there
was
amusement
in
the
reply
i
do
not
think
so
no
that
is
not
the
reason
then
it
because
as
you
said
about
fred
i
might
find
myself
horrifying
that
is
part
of
the
reason
not
the
major
part
however
you
see
i
am
in
a
way
experimenting
do
not
be
alarmed
please
i
shall
not
turn
you
into
a
monster
i
have
too
much
knowledge
of
biology
for
that
but
i
am
not
too
familiar
with
human
beings
what
i
know
i
have
learned
mostly
from
your
books
and
i
have
found
that
in
certain
respects
there
are
inaccuracies
contained
in
them
i
must
go
slowly
until
i
can
check
what
they
say
i
might
mend
certain
organs
and
then
discover
that
they
do
not
have
the
proper
size
or
shape
or
that
they
produce
slightly
altered
hormones
i
do
not
want
to
make
such
mistakes
and
if
i
do
make
them
i
wish
to
correct
them
before
they
can
do
harm
there
no
danger
none
i
assure
you
internally
and
externally
you
will
be
as
before
internally
and
externally
will
i
will
i
be
able
to
have
children
yes
we
ourselves
do
not
have
your
distinctions
of
sex
but
we
are
familiar
with
them
in
many
other
races
we
know
how
important
you
consider
them
i
am
taking
care
to
see
that
the
proper
glandular
balance
is
maintained
in
both
yourself
and
your
husband
thank
you
doctor
but
i
still
do
understand
why
do
you
give
me
eyes
right
away
i
do
not
wish
to
give
you
eyes
that
see
imperfectly
and
then
be
forced
to
take
them
away
nor
do
i
want
you
to
watch
imperfect
arms
and
legs
developing
it
would
be
an
unnecessary
ordeal
when
i
am
sure
that
everything
is
as
it
should
be
then
i
shall
start
your
eyes
and
my
husband
he
will
be
reconstructed
in
the
same
way
he
will
be
brought
in
to
talk
to
you
soon
and
you
do
want
either
of
us
to
see
the
other
in
in
imperfect
condition
it
would
be
inadvisable
i
can
assure
you
now
that
when
i
have
completed
your
treatment
you
will
almost
exactly
be
as
you
were
in
the
beginning
when
that
time
comes
you
will
be
able
to
use
your
eyes
she
was
silent
a
moment
he
said
your
husband
had
other
questions
i
am
waiting
to
hear
you
ask
them
too
i
sorry
doctor
i
was
listening
what
did
you
say
he
repeated
his
remarks
and
she
said
i
do
have
other
questions
but
no
i
wo
ask
them
yet
what
did
my
husband
want
to
know
about
me
and
my
race
how
we
happened
to
find
you
in
time
to
save
you
we
saved
you
what
we
intend
to
do
with
you
after
you
are
reconstructed
yes
i
wondered
about
those
things
too
i
can
give
you
only
a
partial
answer
i
hope
you
do
not
find
it
too
unsatisfactory
my
race
as
you
may
have
gathered
is
somewhat
more
advanced
than
yours
we
have
had
a
head
start
he
added
politely
if
you
can
grow
new
arms
and
legs
and
eyes
she
said
you
must
be
thousands
of
years
ahead
of
us
we
can
do
many
other
things
of
which
there
is
no
need
to
talk
all
i
need
say
now
is
that
i
am
a
physician
attached
to
a
scouting
expedition
we
have
had
previous
contact
with
human
beings
and
have
taken
pains
to
avoid
coming
to
their
attention
we
do
not
want
to
alarm
or
confuse
them
but
all
the
same
you
rescued
us
it
was
an
emergency
we
are
not
human
but
we
have
you
might
say
humanitarian
feelings
we
do
not
like
to
see
creatures
die
even
inferior
creatures
not
that
you
are
of
course
he
added
delicately
our
ship
happened
to
be
only
a
few
thousand
miles
away
when
it
happened
we
saw
and
acted
with
great
speed
once
you
are
whole
again
we
shall
place
you
where
you
will
be
found
by
your
own
kind
and
proceed
on
our
way
by
that
time
our
expedition
will
have
been
completed
when
we
are
whole
again
doctor
will
i
be
exactly
the
same
as
before
in
some
ways
perhaps
even
better
i
can
assure
you
that
all
your
organs
will
function
perfectly
i
do
mean
that
i
mean
will
i
look
the
same
she
felt
that
there
was
astonishment
in
the
pause
look
the
same
does
that
matter
yes
oh
yes
it
matters
it
matters
more
than
anything
else
he
must
have
been
regarding
her
as
if
she
were
crazy
suddenly
she
was
glad
that
she
had
no
eyes
to
see
his
bewilderment
and
his
contempt
which
she
was
sure
must
be
there
too
he
said
slowly
i
did
realize
but
of
course
we
do
know
how
you
did
look
how
can
we
make
you
look
the
same
i
do
know
but
you
must
you
must
her
voice
rose
and
she
felt
the
pain
in
her
throat
as
the
new
muscles
constricted
you
are
getting
hysterical
he
said
stop
thinking
about
this
but
i
ca
stop
thinking
about
it
it
the
only
thing
i
think
of
i
do
want
to
look
any
different
from
the
way
i
did
before
he
said
nothing
and
suddenly
she
felt
tired
a
moment
before
she
had
been
so
excited
so
upset
and
now
merely
tired
and
sleepy
she
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
and
forget
it
all
must
have
given
me
a
she
thought
injection
i
did
feel
the
prick
of
the
needle
but
maybe
they
do
use
needles
anyway
i
glad
he
did
because
now
i
wo
have
to
think
i
wo
be
able
to
think
she
slept
when
she
awoke
again
she
heard
a
new
voice
a
voice
she
could
place
it
said
hello
margaret
where
are
you
who
fred
margaret
your
voice
is
different
so
is
yours
at
first
i
could
think
who
was
speaking
to
me
it
strange
it
took
us
so
long
to
realize
that
our
voices
would
be
different
she
said
shakily
we
more
accustomed
to
thinking
of
how
we
look
he
was
silent
his
mind
had
been
on
the
same
thing
your
new
voice
is
bad
fred
she
said
after
a
moment
i
like
it
it
a
little
deeper
a
little
more
resonant
it
will
go
well
with
your
personality
the
doctor
has
done
a
good
job
i
trying
to
think
whether
i
like
yours
i
do
know
i
suppose
the
kind
of
guy
who
likes
best
what
he
used
to
i
know
that
why
i
did
want
him
to
change
my
looks
again
silence
she
said
fred
i
still
here
have
you
talked
to
him
about
it
he
talked
to
me
he
told
me
about
your
being
worried
do
you
think
it
matters
yes
i
suppose
it
does
he
told
me
he
could
do
a
good
technical
job
leave
us
with
regular
features
and
unblemished
skins
that
is
what
i
want
she
said
fiercely
i
do
want
the
kind
of
regular
features
that
come
out
of
physiology
books
i
want
my
own
features
i
do
care
so
much
about
the
voice
but
i
want
my
own
face
back
that
a
lot
to
ask
for
has
he
done
enough
for
us
no
nothing
counts
unless
i
have
that
do
do
you
think
that
i
being
silly
well
i
do
want
to
be
beautiful
because
i
know
you
do
want
me
to
be
he
sounded
amazed
whoever
told
you
that
do
you
think
that
after
living
with
you
for
two
years
i
do
know
if
you
had
wanted
a
beautiful
wife
you
have
married
one
instead
you
chose
me
you
wanted
to
be
the
one
of
the
family
vain
fred
do
try
to
deny
it
because
it
would
be
no
use
vain
not
that
i
mind
it
but
you
are
are
you
feeling
all
right
margaret
you
sound
overwrought
i
not
i
being
very
logical
if
i
were
either
ugly
or
beautiful
you
hate
me
if
i
were
ugly
people
would
pity
you
and
you
be
able
to
stand
that
and
if
i
were
beautiful
they
might
forget
about
you
i
just
plain
enough
for
them
to
wonder
why
you
ever
married
anyone
so
ordinary
i
just
the
kind
of
person
to
supply
background
for
you
after
a
moment
he
said
slowly
i
never
knew
you
had
ideas
like
that
about
me
they
silly
ideas
i
married
you
because
i
loved
you
maybe
you
did
but
did
you
love
me
he
said
patiently
let
not
go
into
that
the
fact
is
margaret
that
you
talking
nonsense
i
do
give
a
damn
whether
you
ugly
or
beautiful
well
no
that
is
strictly
true
i
do
care
but
looks
are
the
most
important
thing
they
have
very
little
to
do
with
the
way
i
feel
about
you
i
love
you
for
the
kind
of
person
you
are
everything
else
is
secondary
please
fred
do
lie
to
me
i
want
to
be
the
same
as
before
because
i
know
that
the
way
you
want
me
is
there
some
way
to
let
the
doctor
know
what
sort
of
appearance
we
made
you
have
had
a
good
eye
maybe
you
could
describe
us
be
reasonable
margaret
you
ought
to
know
that
you
ca
tell
anything
from
a
description
his
voice
was
almost
pleading
let
leave
well
enough
alone
i
do
care
if
your
features
do
come
out
of
the
pictures
in
a
physiology
textbook
fred
she
said
excitedly
that
it
pictures
remember
that
stereo
shot
we
had
taken
just
before
we
left
mars
it
must
be
somewhere
on
the
ship
but
the
ship
was
crushed
darling
it
a
total
wreck
not
completely
if
they
could
take
out
alive
there
must
have
been
some
unhurt
portions
left
maybe
the
stereo
is
still
there
margaret
you
asking
the
impossible
we
do
know
where
the
ship
is
this
group
the
doctor
is
with
is
on
a
scouting
expedition
the
wreck
of
our
ship
may
have
been
left
far
behind
they
not
going
to
retrace
their
tracks
just
to
find
it
but
it
the
only
way
the
only
way
there
nothing
else
she
broke
down
if
she
had
possessed
eyes
she
would
have
wept
but
as
it
was
she
could
weep
only
internally
they
must
have
taken
him
away
for
there
was
no
answer
to
her
tearless
sobbing
and
after
a
time
she
felt
suddenly
that
there
was
nothing
to
cry
about
she
felt
in
fact
gay
and
cheerful
and
the
thought
struck
her
doctor
given
me
another
drug
he
does
want
me
to
cry
very
well
i
wo
i
think
of
things
to
make
me
happy
i
bubble
over
with
good
spirits
instead
she
fell
into
a
dreamless
sleep
when
she
awoke
again
she
thought
of
the
conversation
with
fred
and
the
feeling
of
desperation
returned
have
to
tell
the
doctor
all
about
she
thought
have
to
see
what
he
can
do
i
know
it
asking
an
awful
lot
but
without
it
all
the
rest
he
has
done
for
me
count
better
to
be
dead
than
be
different
from
what
i
but
it
was
necessary
to
tell
the
doctor
fred
had
spoken
to
him
first
fred
admits
it
important
too
he
wo
be
able
to
deny
any
longer
that
i
judged
him
the
doctor
said
what
you
are
asking
is
impossible
impossible
you
wo
even
try
my
dear
patient
the
wrecked
ship
is
hundreds
of
millions
of
miles
behind
us
the
expedition
has
its
appointed
task
it
can
not
retrace
its
steps
it
can
not
waste
time
searching
the
emptiness
of
space
for
a
stereo
which
may
not
even
exist
any
longer
yes
you
right
i
sorry
i
asked
doctor
he
read
either
her
mind
or
the
hopelessness
in
her
voice
he
said
do
not
make
any
rash
plans
you
can
not
carry
them
out
you
know
i
find
a
way
sooner
or
later
i
find
a
way
to
do
something
to
myself
you
are
being
very
foolish
i
can
not
cease
to
marvel
at
how
foolish
you
are
are
many
human
beings
like
you
psychologically
i
do
know
doctor
i
do
care
i
know
only
what
important
to
me
but
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
the
merest
trifle
the
difference
in
appearance
between
one
human
being
and
another
of
the
same
sex
so
far
as
we
can
see
is
insignificant
you
must
learn
to
regard
it
in
its
true
light
you
think
it
insignificant
because
you
do
know
anything
about
men
and
women
to
fred
and
me
it
the
difference
between
life
and
death
he
said
in
exasperation
you
are
a
race
of
children
but
sometimes
even
a
child
must
be
humored
i
shall
see
what
i
can
do
but
what
could
he
do
she
asked
herself
the
ship
was
a
derelict
in
space
and
in
it
floating
between
the
stars
was
the
stereo
he
make
an
attempt
to
find
would
he
try
to
get
a
description
from
fred
even
the
best
human
artist
could
produce
much
of
a
likeness
from
a
mere
verbal
description
what
could
someone
like
the
doctor
do
someone
to
whom
all
men
looked
alike
and
all
women
as
she
lay
there
thinking
and
wondering
she
had
only
the
vaguest
idea
of
the
passage
of
time
but
slowly
as
what
must
have
been
day
followed
day
she
became
aware
of
strange
tingling
sensations
all
over
her
body
the
pains
she
had
felt
at
first
had
slowly
diminished
and
then
vanished
altogether
what
she
felt
now
was
not
pain
at
all
it
was
even
mildly
pleasant
as
if
some
one
were
gently
massaging
her
body
stretching
her
muscles
tugging
at
her
suddenly
she
realized
what
it
was
new
limbs
were
growing
her
internal
organs
must
have
developed
properly
and
now
the
doctor
had
gone
ahead
with
the
rest
of
his
treatment
with
the
realization
tears
began
to
roll
down
her
cheeks
she
thought
tears
i
can
feel
them
i
getting
arms
and
legs
and
i
can
shed
tears
but
i
still
have
no
maybe
they
growing
in
from
time
to
time
i
seem
to
see
flashes
of
light
maybe
he
making
them
develop
slowly
and
he
put
the
tear
ducts
in
order
first
i
have
to
tell
him
that
my
eyes
must
be
blue
maybe
i
never
was
beautiful
but
i
always
had
pretty
eyes
i
want
any
different
color
they
would
go
with
my
the
next
time
the
doctor
spoke
to
her
she
told
him
you
may
have
your
way
he
said
as
if
humoring
a
child
and
doctor
about
finding
the
ship
again
out
of
the
question
as
i
told
you
however
it
will
not
be
necessary
he
paused
as
if
savoring
what
he
had
to
tell
her
i
checked
with
our
records
department
as
might
have
been
expected
they
searched
your
shattered
ship
thoroughly
in
the
hope
of
finding
information
that
might
contribute
to
our
understanding
of
your
race
they
have
the
stereos
about
a
dozen
of
them
a
stereos
but
i
thought
in
your
excitement
you
may
have
forgotten
that
there
were
more
than
one
all
of
them
seem
to
be
of
yourself
and
your
husband
however
they
were
obviously
taken
under
a
wide
variety
of
conditions
and
with
a
wide
variety
of
equipment
for
there
are
certain
minor
differences
between
them
which
even
i
with
my
vision
can
detect
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
which
one
you
prefer
us
to
use
as
a
model
she
said
slowly
i
had
better
talk
about
that
with
my
husband
can
you
have
him
brought
in
here
doctor
of
course
she
lay
there
thinking
a
dozen
stereos
and
there
was
still
only
one
that
she
remembered
only
a
single
one
they
had
posed
for
others
during
the
honeymoon
and
shortly
after
but
those
had
been
left
at
home
on
mars
before
they
started
on
their
trip
fred
new
voice
said
how
are
you
feeling
dear
strange
i
seem
to
have
new
limbs
growing
in
so
do
i
guess
we
be
our
old
selves
pretty
soon
will
we
she
could
imagine
his
forehead
wrinkling
at
the
intonation
of
her
voice
what
do
you
mean
margaret
has
the
doctor
told
you
they
have
the
stereos
they
found
on
our
ship
now
they
can
model
our
new
faces
after
our
old
that
what
you
wanted
is
it
but
what
do
want
fred
i
remember
only
a
single
one
and
the
doctor
says
they
found
a
dozen
and
he
says
that
my
face
differs
from
shot
to
shot
fred
was
silent
are
they
as
beautiful
as
all
that
fred
you
do
understand
margaret
i
understand
only
too
well
i
just
want
to
know
were
they
taken
before
we
were
married
or
after
before
of
course
i
have
gone
out
with
another
girl
since
our
wedding
thank
you
dear
her
own
new
voice
had
venom
in
it
and
she
caught
herself
must
talk
like
she
thought
know
fred
i
know
his
weakness
i
knew
them
before
i
married
him
i
have
to
accept
them
and
help
him
not
rant
at
him
for
he
said
they
were
just
girls
i
knew
casually
but
nothing
much
otherwise
not
in
a
class
with
you
do
apologize
this
time
her
voice
was
calm
even
amused
you
could
help
attracting
them
why
did
you
tell
me
that
you
kept
their
pictures
i
thought
you
be
jealous
perhaps
i
would
have
been
but
i
have
got
over
it
anyway
fred
is
there
any
one
of
them
you
liked
particularly
he
became
wary
she
thought
his
voice
was
expressionless
as
he
said
no
why
oh
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
want
the
doctor
to
make
me
look
like
her
do
be
silly
margaret
i
do
want
you
to
look
like
anybody
but
yourself
i
do
want
to
see
their
empty
faces
ever
again
but
i
thought
tell
the
doctor
to
keep
the
other
stereos
let
him
put
them
in
one
of
his
museums
with
other
dead
things
they
do
mean
anything
to
me
any
more
they
have
meant
anything
for
a
long
time
the
only
reason
i
did
throw
them
away
is
because
i
forgot
they
were
there
and
think
of
it
all
right
fred
i
tell
him
to
use
our
picture
as
a
model
the
ac
studio
shot
the
make
sure
he
uses
the
right
one
i
see
that
there
no
mistake
when
i
think
i
might
have
to
look
at
one
of
mugs
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
get
a
cold
sweat
do
take
any
chances
margaret
your
face
i
want
to
see
and
no
one
else
yes
dear
be
she
thought
i
wear
well
a
background
always
wears
well
time
ca
hurt
it
much
because
there
nothing
there
to
one
thing
i
overlooked
though
how
old
will
we
look
the
doctor
is
rather
insensitive
about
human
faces
and
he
might
age
us
a
bit
he
must
do
that
it
be
all
right
if
he
wants
to
make
us
a
little
younger
but
not
older
i
have
to
warn
she
warned
him
and
again
he
seemed
rather
amused
at
her
all
right
he
said
you
will
appear
slightly
younger
not
too
much
so
however
for
from
my
reading
i
judge
it
best
for
a
human
face
to
show
not
too
great
a
discrepancy
from
the
physiological
age
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
it
was
settled
now
all
settled
everything
would
be
as
before
perhaps
just
a
little
better
she
and
fred
could
go
back
to
their
married
life
with
the
knowledge
that
they
would
be
as
happy
as
ever
nothing
exuberant
of
course
but
as
happy
as
their
own
peculiar
natures
permitted
as
happy
as
a
plain
and
worried
wife
and
a
handsome
husband
could
ever
be
now
that
this
had
been
decided
the
days
passed
slowly
her
arms
and
legs
grew
and
her
eyes
too
she
could
feel
the
beginnings
of
fingers
and
toes
and
on
the
sensitive
optic
nerve
the
flashes
of
light
came
with
greater
and
greater
frequency
there
were
slight
pains
from
time
to
time
but
they
were
pains
she
welcomed
they
were
the
pains
of
growth
of
return
to
normalcy
and
then
came
the
day
when
the
doctor
said
you
have
recovered
in
another
day
as
you
measure
time
i
shall
remove
your
bandages
tears
welled
up
in
her
new
eyes
doctor
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
no
thanks
are
needed
i
have
only
done
my
work
what
will
you
do
with
us
now
there
is
an
old
freighter
of
your
people
which
we
have
found
abandoned
and
adrift
we
have
repaired
it
and
stocked
it
with
food
taken
from
your
own
ship
you
will
awaken
inside
the
freighter
and
be
able
to
reach
your
own
people
but
wo
i
ca
i
even
get
the
chance
to
see
you
that
would
be
inadvisable
we
have
some
perhaps
peculiar
ideas
about
keeping
our
nature
secret
that
is
why
we
shall
take
care
that
you
carry
away
nothing
that
we
ourselves
have
made
if
i
could
only
well
even
shake
hands
do
i
have
no
hands
no
hands
but
how
could
you
how
can
you
do
such
complicated
things
i
may
not
answer
i
am
sorry
to
leave
you
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
but
i
have
no
choice
now
please
no
more
questions
about
me
do
you
wish
to
talk
to
your
husband
for
a
time
before
you
sleep
again
must
i
sleep
i
feel
so
excited
i
want
to
get
out
of
bed
tear
off
my
bandages
and
see
what
i
look
like
i
take
it
that
you
are
not
anxious
to
speak
to
your
husband
yet
i
want
to
see
myself
first
you
will
have
to
wait
during
your
last
sleep
your
new
muscles
will
be
exercised
their
tones
and
strength
built
up
you
will
receive
a
final
medical
examination
it
is
most
important
she
started
to
protest
once
more
but
he
stopped
her
try
to
be
calm
i
can
control
your
feelings
with
drugs
but
it
is
better
that
you
control
yourself
you
will
be
able
to
give
vent
to
your
excitement
later
and
now
i
must
leave
you
you
will
not
hear
from
me
after
this
never
again
never
again
goodbye
for
a
moment
she
felt
something
cool
and
dry
and
rough
laid
very
lightly
against
her
forehead
she
tried
to
reach
for
him
but
could
only
twitch
her
new
hands
on
her
new
wrists
she
said
with
a
sob
goodbye
doctor
when
she
spoke
again
there
was
no
answer
she
slept
this
time
the
awakening
was
different
before
she
opened
her
eyes
she
heard
the
creaking
of
the
freighter
and
a
slight
hum
that
might
have
come
from
the
firing
of
the
jets
as
she
tried
to
sit
up
her
eyes
flashed
open
and
she
saw
that
she
was
lying
in
a
bunk
strapped
down
to
keep
from
being
thrown
out
unsteadily
she
began
to
loosen
the
straps
when
they
were
half
off
she
stopped
to
stare
at
her
hands
they
were
strong
hands
and
supple
with
a
healthily
tanned
skin
she
flexed
them
and
unflexed
them
several
times
beautiful
hands
the
doctor
had
done
well
by
her
she
finished
undoing
the
straps
and
got
to
her
feet
there
was
none
of
the
dizziness
she
had
expected
none
of
the
weakness
that
would
have
been
normal
after
so
long
a
stay
in
bed
she
felt
fine
she
examined
herself
staring
at
her
legs
body
staring
as
she
might
have
done
at
a
stranger
legs
and
body
she
took
a
few
steps
forward
and
then
back
yes
he
had
done
well
by
her
it
was
a
graceful
body
and
it
felt
fine
better
than
new
but
her
face
she
whirled
around
to
locate
a
mirror
and
heard
a
voice
margaret
fred
was
getting
out
of
another
bunk
their
eyes
sought
each
faces
and
for
a
long
moment
they
stared
in
silence
fred
said
in
a
choked
voice
there
must
be
a
mirror
in
the
cabin
i
got
to
see
myself
illustration
at
the
mirror
their
eyes
shifted
from
one
face
to
the
other
and
back
again
and
the
silence
this
time
was
longer
more
painful
a
wonderful
artist
the
doctor
for
a
creature
a
person
who
was
insensitive
to
the
differences
in
human
faces
he
could
follow
a
pattern
perfectly
feature
by
feature
they
were
as
before
size
and
shape
of
forehead
dip
of
hairline
width
of
cheeks
and
height
of
cheekbones
shape
and
color
of
eyes
contour
of
nose
and
lips
and
chin
nothing
in
the
two
faces
had
been
changed
nothing
at
all
nothing
that
is
but
the
overall
effect
nothing
but
the
fact
that
where
before
she
had
been
plain
now
she
was
beautiful
should
have
realized
the
she
thought
you
see
two
sisters
or
mother
and
daughter
with
the
same
features
the
faces
as
alike
as
if
they
had
been
cast
from
the
same
mold
and
yet
one
is
ugly
and
the
other
beautiful
many
artists
can
copy
features
but
few
can
copy
with
perfect
exactness
either
beauty
or
ugliness
the
doctor
slipped
up
a
little
despite
my
warning
he
done
too
well
by
not
well
enough
by
fred
fred
is
handsome
any
more
not
ugly
really
his
face
is
stronger
and
more
interesting
than
it
was
but
now
i
the
one
of
the
family
and
he
wo
be
able
to
take
it
this
is
the
end
for
fred
was
grinning
at
her
he
said
wow
what
a
wife
i
got
just
look
at
you
do
you
mind
if
i
drool
a
bit
she
said
uncertainly
fred
dear
i
sorry
for
what
for
his
giving
you
more
than
you
bargained
for
and
me
less
it
all
in
the
family
you
do
have
to
pretend
fred
i
know
how
you
feel
you
do
know
a
thing
i
him
to
make
you
beautiful
i
sure
he
could
but
i
asked
him
anyway
and
he
said
he
try
you
him
oh
no
oh
yes
he
said
are
you
sorry
i
hoped
he
do
better
for
me
but
well
did
you
marry
me
for
my
looks
you
know
better
fred
i
did
marry
you
for
yours
either
i
told
you
that
before
but
you
would
believe
me
maybe
now
you
will
her
voice
choked
perhaps
perhaps
looks
are
so
important
after
all
perhaps
i
been
all
wrong
about
everything
i
used
to
think
was
essential
you
have
agreed
fred
but
you
always
had
a
sense
of
inferiority
about
your
appearance
from
now
on
you
have
no
reason
for
that
and
maybe
now
we
both
be
able
to
grow
up
a
little
she
nodded
it
gave
her
a
strange
feeling
to
have
him
put
around
her
a
pair
of
arms
she
had
never
before
known
to
have
him
kiss
her
with
lips
she
had
never
before
touched
that
does
she
thought
important
thing
is
that
whatever
shape
we
take
us
important
thing
is
that
now
we
do
have
to
worry
about
ourselves
and
for
that
we
have
to
him
fred
she
said
suddenly
her
face
against
his
chest
do
you
think
a
girl
can
be
in
love
with
two
two
people
at
the
same
time
and
one
of
them
one
of
them
not
a
man
not
even
human
he
nodded
but
did
say
anything
and
after
a
moment
she
thought
she
knew
why
man
can
love
that
way
she
thought
one
of
them
not
a
woman
wonder
if
he
she
it
knew
i
wonder
if
it
