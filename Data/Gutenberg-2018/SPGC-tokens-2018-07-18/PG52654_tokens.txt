the
autobiography
of
goethe
truth
and
poetry
from
my
own
life
translated
from
the
german
john
oxenford
london
george
bell
and
sons
advertisement
before
the
following
translation
was
commenced
the
first
ten
books
had
already
appeared
in
america
it
was
the
intention
of
the
publisher
to
reprint
these
without
alteration
but
on
comparing
them
with
the
original
it
was
perceived
that
the
american
version
was
not
sufficiently
faithful
and
therefore
the
present
was
undertaken
the
translator
however
is
bound
to
acknowledge
that
he
found
many
successful
renderings
in
the
work
of
his
predecessor
and
these
he
has
engrafted
without
hesitation
the
title
truth
and
poetry
is
adopted
in
common
with
the
american
translation
as
the
nearest
rendering
of
und
the
prose
and
poetry
of
my
life
would
perhaps
convey
to
the
english
reader
the
exact
meaning
of
the
author
although
not
literally
his
words
author
preface
as
a
preface
to
the
present
work
which
perhaps
more
than
another
requires
one
i
adduce
the
letter
of
a
friend
by
which
so
serious
an
undertaking
was
occasioned
we
have
now
my
dear
friend
collected
the
twelve
parts
of
your
poetical
works
and
on
reading
them
through
find
much
that
is
known
much
that
is
unknown
while
much
that
had
been
forgotten
is
revived
by
this
collection
these
twelve
volumes
standing
before
us
in
uniform
appearance
we
can
not
refrain
from
regarding
as
a
whole
and
one
would
like
to
sketch
therefrom
some
image
of
the
author
and
his
talents
but
it
can
not
be
denied
considering
the
vigour
with
which
he
began
his
literary
career
and
the
length
of
time
which
has
since
elapsed
that
a
dozen
small
volumes
must
appear
incommensurate
nor
can
one
forget
that
with
respect
to
the
detached
pieces
they
have
mostly
been
called
forth
by
special
occasions
and
reflect
particular
external
objects
as
well
as
distinct
grades
of
inward
culture
while
it
is
equally
clear
that
temporary
moral
and
æsthetic
maxims
and
convictions
prevail
in
them
as
a
whole
however
these
productions
remain
without
connexion
nay
it
is
often
difficult
to
believe
that
they
emanate
from
one
and
the
same
writer
your
friends
in
the
meantime
have
not
relinquished
the
inquiry
and
try
as
they
become
more
closely
acquainted
with
your
mode
of
life
and
thought
to
guess
many
a
riddle
to
solve
many
a
problem
indeed
with
the
assistance
of
an
old
liking
and
a
connexion
of
many
years
standing
they
find
a
charm
even
in
the
difficulties
which
present
themselves
yet
a
little
assistance
here
and
there
would
not
be
unacceptable
and
you
can
not
well
refuse
this
to
our
friendly
entreaties
the
first
thing
then
we
require
is
that
your
poetical
works
arranged
in
the
late
edition
according
to
some
internal
relations
may
be
presented
by
you
in
chronological
order
and
that
the
states
of
life
and
feeling
which
afforded
the
examples
that
influenced
you
and
the
theoretical
principles
by
which
you
were
governed
may
be
imparted
in
some
kind
of
connexion
bestow
this
labour
for
the
gratification
of
a
limited
circle
and
perhaps
it
may
give
rise
to
something
that
will
be
entertaining
and
useful
to
an
extensive
one
the
author
to
the
most
advanced
period
of
his
life
should
not
relinquish
the
advantage
of
communicating
even
at
a
distance
with
those
whom
affection
binds
to
him
and
if
it
is
not
granted
to
everyone
to
step
forth
anew
at
a
certain
age
with
surprising
and
powerful
productions
yet
just
at
that
period
of
life
when
knowledge
is
most
perfect
and
consciousness
most
distinct
it
must
be
a
very
agreeable
and
task
to
treat
former
creations
as
new
matter
and
work
them
up
into
a
kind
of
last
part
which
may
serve
once
more
for
the
edification
of
those
who
have
been
previously
edified
with
and
by
the
artist
this
desire
so
kindly
expressed
immediately
awakened
within
me
an
inclination
to
comply
with
it
for
if
in
the
early
years
of
life
our
passions
lead
us
to
follow
our
own
course
and
in
order
not
to
swerve
from
it
we
impatiently
repel
the
demands
of
others
so
in
bur
later
days
it
becomes
highly
advantageous
to
us
should
any
sympathy
excite
and
determine
us
cordially
to
new
activity
i
therefore
instantly
undertook
the
preparatory
labour
of
separating
the
poems
of
my
twelve
volumes
both
great
and
small
and
of
arranging
them
according
to
years
i
strove
to
recall
the
times
and
circumstances
under
which
each
had
been
produced
but
the
task
soon
grew
more
difficult
as
full
explanatory
notes
and
illustrations
were
necessary
to
fill
up
the
chasms
between
those
which
had
already
been
given
to
the
world
for
in
the
first
place
all
on
which
i
had
originally
exercised
myself
were
wanting
many
that
had
been
begun
and
not
finished
were
also
wanting
and
of
many
that
were
finished
even
the
external
form
had
completely
disappeared
haring
since
been
entirely
reworked
and
cast
into
a
different
shape
besides
i
had
also
to
call
to
mind
how
i
had
laboured
in
the
sciences
and
other
arts
and
what
in
such
apparently
foreign
departments
both
individually
and
in
conjunction
with
friends
i
had
practised
in
silence
or
had
laid
before
the
public
all
this
i
wished
to
introduce
by
degrees
for
the
satisfaction
of
my
but
my
efforts
and
reflections
always
led
me
further
on
since
while
i
was
anxious
to
comply
with
that
very
considerate
request
and
laboured
to
set
forth
in
succession
my
internal
emotions
external
influences
and
the
steps
which
theoretically
and
practically
i
had
trod
i
was
carried
out
of
my
narrow
private
sphere
into
the
wide
world
the
images
of
a
hundred
important
men
who
either
directly
or
indirectly
had
influenced
me
presented
themselves
to
my
view
and
even
the
prodigious
movements
of
the
great
political
world
which
had
operated
most
extensively
upon
me
as
well
as
upon
the
whole
mass
of
my
contemporaries
had
to
be
particularly
considered
for
this
seems
to
be
the
main
object
of
biography
to
exhibit
the
man
in
relation
to
the
features
of
his
time
and
to
show
to
what
extent
they
have
opposed
or
favoured
his
progress
what
view
of
mankind
and
the
world
he
has
formed
from
them
and
how
far
he
himself
if
an
artist
poet
or
author
may
externally
reflect
them
but
for
this
is
required
what
is
scarcely
attainable
namely
that
the
individual
should
know
himself
and
his
age
himself
so
far
as
he
has
remained
the
same
under
all
circumstances
his
age
as
that
which
carries
along
with
it
determines
and
fashions
both
the
willing
and
the
unwilling
so
that
one
may
venture
to
pronounce
that
any
person
born
ten
years
earlier
or
later
would
have
been
quite
a
different
being
both
as
regards
his
own
culture
and
his
influence
on
others
in
this
manner
from
such
reflections
and
endeavours
from
such
recollections
and
considerations
arose
the
present
delineation
and
from
this
point
of
view
as
to
its
origin
will
it
be
the
best
enjoyed
and
used
and
most
impartially
estimated
for
anything
further
it
may
be
needful
to
say
particularly

respect

the

therefore
to

not

until
this
hour
was
passed
these
good
aspects
which
the
astrologers
managed
subsequently
to
reckon
very
auspicious
for
me
may
have
been
the
causes
of
my
preservation
for
through
the
unskilfulness
of
the
midwife
i
came
into
the
world
as
dead
and
only
alter
various
efforts
was
i
enabled
to
see
the
light
this
event
which
had
put
our
household
into
sore
straits
turned
to
the
advantage
of
my
inasmuch
as
my
grandfather
the
john
wolfgang
textor
took
occasion
from
it
to
have
an
established
and
to
introduce
or
revive
the
tuition
of
midwives
which
may
have
done
some
good
to
those
who
were
born
after
me
when
we
desire
to
recall
what
befel
us
in
the
earliest
period
of
youth
it
often
happens
that
we
confound
what
we
have
heard
from
others
with
that
which
we
really
possess
from
our
own
direct
experience
without
therefore
instituting
a
very
close
investigation
into
the
point
which
after
all
could
lead
to
nothing
i
am
conscious
that
we
lived
in
an
old
house
which
in
fact
consisted
of
two
adjoining
houses
that
had
been
opened
into
each
other
a
spiral
led
to
rooms
on
different
levels
and
the
unevenness
of
the
stories
was
remedied
by
steps
for
us
children
a
younger
sister
and
myself
the
favourite
resort
was
a
spacious
floor
below
near
the
door
of
which
was
a
large
wooden
lattice
that
allowed
us
direct
communication
with
the
street
and
open
air
a
of
this
sort
with
which
many
houses
were
provided
was
called
a
frame
the
women
sat
in
it
to
sew
and
knit
the
cook
picked
her
salad
there
female
neighbours
chatted
with
each
other
and
the
streets
consequently
in
the
fine
season
wore
a
southern
aspect
one
felt
at
ease
while
in
communication
with
the
public
we
children
too
by
means
of
these
frames
were
brought
into
contact
with
our
neighbours
of
whom
three
brothers
von
ochsenstein
the
surviving
sons
of
the
deceased
schultheiss
living
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
won
my
love
and
occupied
and
diverted
themselves
with
me
in
many
ways
our
family
liked
to
tell
of
all
sorts
of
waggeries
to
which
i
was
enticed
by
these
otherwise
grave
and
solitary
men
let
one
of
these
pranks
suffice
for
all
a
crockery
fair
had
just
been
held
from
which
not
only
our
kitchen
had
been
supplied
for
a
while
with
articles
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
a
great
deal
of
small
gear
of
the
same
ware
had
been
purchased
as
playthings
for
us
children
one
fine
afternoon
when
every
thing
was
quiet
in
the
house
i
whiled
away
the
time
with
my
pots
and
dishes
in
the
frame
and
finding
that
nothing
more
was
to
be
got
out
of
them
hurled
one
of
them
into
the
street
the
von
ochsensteins
who
saw
me
so
delighted
at
the
fine
smash
it
made
that
i
clapped
my
hands
for
joy
cried
out
another
i
was
not
long
in
flinging
out
a
pot
and
as
they
made
no
end
to
their
calls
for
more
by
degrees
the
whole
collection
platters
pipkins
mugs
and
all
were
dashed
upon
the
pavement
my
neighbours
continued
to
express
their
approbation
and
i
was
highly
delighted
to
give
them
pleasure
but
my
stock
was
exhausted
and
still
they
shouted
more
i
ran
therefore
straight
to
the
kitchen
and
brought
the
earthenware
which
produced
a
still
livelier
spectacle
in
breaking
and
thus
i
kept
running
backwards
and
forwards
fetching
one
plate
after
another
as
i
could
reach
it
from
where
they
stood
in
rows
on
the
shelf
but
as
that
did
not
satisfy
my
audience
i
devoted
all
the
ware
that
i
could
drag
out
to
similar
destruction
it
was
not
till
afterwards
that
any
one
appeared
to
hinder
and
save
the
mischief
was
done
and
in
place
of
so
much
broken
crockery
there
was
at
least
a
ludicrous
story
in
which
the
roguish
authors
took
special
delight
to
the
end
of
their
days
my
father
mother
in
whose
house
we
properly
dwelt
lived
in
a
large
directly
on
the
ground
floor
and
we
were
accustomed
to
carry
on
our
sports
even
up
to
her
chair
and
when
she
was
ill
up
to
her
bedside
i
remember
her
as
it
were
a
spirit
a
handsome
thin
woman
always
neatly
dressed
in
white
mild
gentle
and
kind
she
has
ever
remained
in
my
memory
the
the
street
in
which
our
house
was
situated
passed
by
the
name
of
the
but
as
neither
stags
nor
ditches
were
to
be
seen
we
wished
to
have
the
expression
explained
they
told
us
that
our
house
stood
on
a
spot
that
was
once
outside
the
city
and
that
where
the
street
now
ran
had
formerly
been
a
ditch
in
which
a
number
of
stags
were
kept
these
stags
were
preserved
and
fed
here
because
the
senate
every
year
according
to
an
ancient
custom
feasted
publicly
on
a
stag
which
was
therefore
always
at
hand
in
the
ditch
for
such
a
festival
in
case
princes
or
knights
interfered
with
the
city
right
of
chase
outside
or
the
walls
were
encompassed
or
besieged
by
an
enemy
this
pleased
us
much
and
we
wished
that
such
a
lair
for
tame
animals
could
have
been
seen
in
our
times
the
back
of
the
house
from
the
second
story
particularly
commanded
a
very
pleasant
prospect
over
an
almost
immeasurable
extent
of
neighbouring
gardens
stretching
to
the
very
walls
of
the
city
but
alas
in
transforming
what
were
once
public
grounds
into
private
gardens
our
house
and
some
others
lying
towards
the
corner
of
the
street
had
been
much
stinted
since
the
houses
towards
the
had
appropriated
spacious
and
large
gardens
to
themselves
while
a
tolerably
high
wall
shut
us
out
from
these
adjacent
paradises
on
the
second
floor
was
a
room
which
was
called
the
because
they
had
there
endeavoured
to
supply
the
want
of
a
garden
by
means
of
a
few
plants
placed
before
the
window
as
i
grew
older
it
was
there
that
i
made
my
favourite
not
melancholy
but
somewhat
sentimental
retreat
over
these
gardens
beyond
the
city
walls
and
ramparts
might
be
seen
a
beautiful
and
fertile
plain
the
same
which
stretches
towards
höchst
in
the
summer
season
i
commonly
earned
my
lessons
there
and
watched
the
but
could
never
look
my
fill
at
the
setting
sun
which
went
down
directly
opposite
my
windows
and
when
at
the
same
time
i
saw
the
neighbours
wandering
through
their
gardens
taking
care
of
their
flowers
the
children
playing
parties
of
friends
enjoying
themselves
and
could
hear
the
bowls
rolling
and
the
nine
pins
dropping
it
early
excited
within
me
a
feeling
of
solitude
and
a
sense
of
vague
longing
resulting
from
it
which
conspiring
with
the
seriousness
and
awe
implanted
in
me
by
nature
exerted
its
influence
at
an
early
age
and
showed
itself
more
distinctly
in
after
years
the
old
many
cornered
and
gloomy
arrangement
of
the
house
was
moreover
adapted
to
awaken
dread
and
terror
in
childish
minds
unfortunately
too
the
principle
of
discipline
that
young
persons
should
be
early
deprived
of
all
fear
for
the
awful
and
invisible
and
accustomed
to
the
terrible
still
prevailed
we
children
therefore
were
compelled
to
sleep
alone
and
when
we
found
this
impossible
and
softly
slipped
from
our
beds
to
seek
the
society
of
the
servants
and
maids
our
father
with
his
turned
inside
out
which
disguised
him
sufficiently
for
the
purpose
placed
himself
in
the
way
and
frightened
us
back
to
our
the
evil
effect
of
this
any
one
may
imagine
how
is
he
who
is
encompassed
with
a
double
terror
to
be
emancipated
from
fear
my
mother
always
cheerful
and
gay
and
willing
to
render
others
so
discovered
a
much
better
pedagogical
expedient
she
managed
to
gain
her
end
by
rewards
it
was
the
season
for
peaches
the
plentiful
enjoyment
of
which
she
promised
us
every
morning
if
we
overcame
our
fears
during
the
night
in
this
way
she
succeeded
and
both
parties
were
satisfied
in
the
interior
of
the
house
my
eyes
were
chiefly
attracted
by
a
series
of
roman
views
with
which
my
father
had
ornamented
an
they
were
engravings
by
some
of
the
accomplished
predecessors
of
piranesi
who
well
understood
perspective
and
architecture
and
whose
touches
were
clear
and
excellent
there
i
saw
every
day
the
del
the
the
piazza
of
and
peter
church
within
and
without
the
castle
of
and
many
other
places
these
images
impressed
themselves
deeply
upon
me
and
my
otherwise
very
laconic
father
was
often
so
kind
as
to
furnish
descriptions
of
the
objects
his
partiality
for
the
italian
language
and
for
every
thing
pertaining
to
italy
was
very
decided
a
small
collection
of
marbles
and
natural
curiosities
which
he
had
brought
with
him
thence
he
often
showed
to
us
and
he
devoted
a
great
part
of
his
time
to
a
description
of
his
travels
written
in
italian
the
copying
and
correction
of
which
he
slowly
and
accurately
completed
in
several
parcels
with
his
own
hand
a
lively
old
teacher
of
italian
called
giovinazzi
was
of
service
to
him
in
this
work
the
old
man
moreover
did
not
sing
badly
and
my
mother
every
day
must
needs
accompany
him
and
herself
upon
the
clavichord
and
thus
i
speedily
learned
the
bosco
so
as
to
know
it
by
heart
before
i
understood
it
my
father
was
altogether
of
a
didactic
turn
and
in
his
retirement
from
business
liked
to
communicate
to
others
what
he
knew
or
was
able
to
do
thus
dining
the
first
years
of
their
marriage
he
had
kept
my
mother
busily
engaged
in
writing
playing
the
clavichord
and
singing
by
which
means
she
had
been
laid
under
the
necessity
of
acquiring
some
knowledge
and
a
slight
readiness
in
the
italian
tongue
the
generally
we
passed
all
our
leisure
hours
with
my
grandmother
in
whose
spacious
apartment
we
found
plenty
of
room
for
our
sports
she
contrived
to
engage
us
with
various
trifles
and
to
regale
us
with
all
sorts
of
nice
morsels
but
one
christmas
evening
she
crowned
all
her
kind
deeds
by
having
a
exhibited
before
us
and
thus
unfolding
a
new
world
in
the
old
house
this
unexpected
drama
attracted
our
young
minds
with
great
force
upon
the
boy
particularly
it
made
a
very
strong
impression
which
continued
to
vibrate
with
a
great
and
lasting
effect
the
little
stage
with
its
speechless
personages
which
at
the
outset
had
only
been
exhibited
to
us
but
was
afterwards
given
over
for
our
own
use
and
dramatic
vivification
was
prized
more
highly
by
us
children
as
it
was
the
last
bequest
of
our
good
grandmother
whom
encroaching
disease
first
withdrew
from
our
sight
and
death
next
tore
away
from
our
hearts
for
ever
her
departure
was
of
still
more
importance
to
our
family
as
it
drew
after
it
a
complete
change
in
our
condition
as
long
as
my
grandmother
lived
my
father
had
refrained
from
any
attempt
to
change
or
renovate
the
house
even
in
the
slightest
particular
though
it
was
known
that
he
had
pretty
large
plans
of
building
which
were
now
immediately
begun
in
frankfort
as
in
many
other
old
towns
when
anybody
put
up
a
wooden
structure
he
ventured
for
the
sake
of
space
to
make
not
only
the
first
but
each
successive
story
project
over
the
lower
one
by
which
means
narrow
streets
especially
were
rendered
somewhat
dark
and
confined
at
last
a
law
was
passed
that
every
one
putting
up
a
new
house
from
the
ground
should
confine
his
projections
to
the
first
upper
story
and
carry
the
others
up
perpendicularly
my
father
that
he
might
not
lose
the
projecting
space
in
the
second
story
caring
little
for
outward
architectural
appearance
and
anxious
only
for
the
good
and
convenient
arrangement
of
the
interior
resorted
to
the
expedient
which
others
had
employed
before
him
of
propping
the
upper
part
of
the
house
until
one
part
after
another
had
been
removed
from
the
bottom
upwards
and
a
new
house
as
it
were
inserted
in
its
place
thus
while
comparatively
none
of
the
old
structure
remained
the
new
one
merely
passed
for
a
repair
now
as
the
tearing
down
and
building
up
was
done
gradually
my
father
determined
hot
to
quit
the
house
that
he
might
better
direct
and
give
his
orders
as
he
possessed
a
good
knowledge
of
the
technicalities
of
building
at
the
same
time
he
would
not
suffer
his
family
to
leave
him
this
new
epoch
was
very
surprising
and
strange
for
the
children
to
see
the
rooms
in
which
they
had
so
often
been
confined
and
pestered
with
wearisome
tasks
and
studies
the
passages
they
had
played
in
the
walls
which
had
always
been
kept
so
carefully
clean
all
falling
before
the
mason
hatchet
and
the
carpenter
axe
and
that
from
the
bottom
upwards
to
float
as
it
were
in
the
air
propped
up
by
beams
being
at
the
same
time
constantly
confined
to
a
certain
lesson
or
definite
task
all
this
produced
a
commotion
in
our
young
heads
that
was
not
easily
settled
but
the
young
people
felt
the
inconvenience
less
because
they
had
somewhat
more
space
for
play
than
before
and
had
many
opportunities
of
swinging
on
beams
and
playing
at
with
the
boards
at
first
my
father
obstinately
persisted
in
carrying
out
his
plan
but
when
at
last
even
the
roof
was
partly
removed
and
the
rain
reached
our
beds
in
spite
of
the
carpets
that
had
been
taken
up
converted
into
tarpaulin
and
stretched
over
as
a
defence
he
determined
though
reluctantly
that
the
children
should
be
entrusted
for
a
time
to
some
kind
friends
who
had
already
offered
their
services
and
sent
to
a
public
school
this
transition
was
rather
unpleasant
for
when
the
children
who
had
all
along
been
kept
at
home
in
a
secluded
pure
refined
yet
strict
manner
were
thrown
among
a
rude
mass
of
young
creatures
they
were
compelled
unexpectedly
to
suffer
everything
from
the
vulgar
bad
and
even
base
since
they
lacked
both
weapons
and
skill
to
protect
themselves
the
walk
round
frankfort
it
was
properly
about
this
period
that
i
first
became
acquainted
with
my
native
city
which
i
strolled
over
with
more
and
more
freedom
in
every
direction
sometimes
alone
and
sometimes
in
the
company
of
lively
companions
to
convey
to
others
in
any
degree
the
impression
made
upon
me
by
these
grave
and
revered
spots
i
must
here
introduce
a
description
of
my
as
in
its
different
parts
it
was
gradually
unfolded
to
me
i
loved
more
than
anything
else
to
promenade
on
the
great
bridge
over
the
maine
its
length
its
firmness
and
its
fine
appearance
rendered
it
a
notable
structure
and
it
was
besides
almost
the
only
memorial
left
from
ancient
times
of
the
precautions
due
from
the
civil
government
to
its
citizens
the
beautiful
stream
above
and
below
bridge
attracted
my
eye
and
when
the
gilt
weathercock
on
the
glittered
in
the
sunshine
i
always
had
a
pleasant
feeling
generally
i
extended
my
walk
through
sachsenhausen
and
for
a
was
ferried
comfortably
across
the
river
i
was
now
again
on
this
side
of
the
stream
stole
along
to
the
wine
market
and
admired
the
mechanism
of
the
cranes
when
goods
were
unloaded
but
it
was
particularly
entertaining
to
watch
the
arrival
of
the
from
which
so
many
and
such
extraordinary
figures
were
seen
to
disembark
on
entering
the
city
the
saalhof
which
at
least
stood
on
the
spot
where
the
castle
of
emperor
charlemagne
and
his
successors
was
reported
to
have
been
was
greeted
every
time
with
profound
reverence
one
liked
to
lose
oneself
in
the
old
trading
town
particularly
on
among
the
crowd
collected
about
the
church
of
bartholomew
from
the
earliest
times
throngs
of
buyers
and
sellers
had
gathered
there
and
the
place
being
thus
occupied
it
was
not
easy
in
later
days
to
bring
about
a
more
roomy
and
cheerful
arrangement
the
booths
of
the
were
very
important
places
for
us
children
and
we
carried
many
a
to
them
in
order
to
purchase
sheets
of
coloured
paper
stamped
with
gold
animals
but
seldom
however
could
one
make
one
way
through
the
narrow
crowded
and
dirty
i
call
to
mind
also
that
i
always
flew
past
the
adjoining
narrow
and
disgusting
as
they
were
in
perfect
horror
on
the
other
hand
the
roman
hill
römerberg
was
a
most
delightful
place
for
walking
the
way
to
the
along
by
the
new
shops
was
always
cheering
and
pleasant
yet
we
regretted
that
a
street
did
not
lead
into
the
zeil
by
the
church
of
our
lady
and
that
we
always
had
to
go
a
way
by
the
or
the
catherine
gate
but
what
chiefly
attracted
the
child
attention
were
the
many
little
towns
within
the
town
the
fortresses
within
the
fortress
the
walled
monastic
enclosures
and
several
other
precincts
remaining
from
earlier
times
and
more
or
less
like
castles
as
the
nuremberg
court
the
compostella
the
braunfels
the
ancestral
house
of
the
family
of
stallburg
and
several
strongholds
in
later
days
transformed
into
dwellings
and
warehouses
no
architecture
of
an
elevating
kind
was
then
to
be
seen
in
frankfort
and
every
thing
pointed
to
a
period
long
past
and
unquiet
both
for
town
and
district
gates
and
towers
which
defined
the
bounds
of
the
old
city
then
further
on
again
gates
towers
walls
bridges
ramparts
moats
with
which
the
new
city
was
encompassed
all
showed
but
too
plainly
that
a
necessity
for
guarding
the
common
weal
in
disastrous
times
had
induced
these
arrangements
that
all
the
squares
and
streets
even
the
newest
broadest
and
best
laid
out
owed
their
origin
to
chance
and
caprice
and
not
to
any
regulating
mind
a
certain
liking
for
the
antique
was
thus
implanted
in
the
boy
and
was
specially
nourished
and
promoted
by
old
chronicles
and
as
for
instance
those
of
grave
relating
to
the
siege
of
frankfort
at
the
same
time
a
different
taste
was
developed
in
him
for
observing
the
conditions
of
mankind
in
their
manifold
variety
and
naturalness
without
regard
to
their
importance
or
beauty
it
was
therefore
one
of
our
favourite
walks
which
we
endeavoured
to
take
now
and
then
in
the
course
of
a
year
to
follow
the
circuit
of
the
path
inside
the
city
walls
gardens
courts
and
back
buildings
extend
to
the
and
we
saw
many
thousand
people
amid
their
little
domestic
and
secluded
circumstances
from
the
ornamental
and
show
gardens
of
the
rich
to
the
orchards
of
the
citizen
anxious
about
his
necessities
from
thence
to
the
factories
and
similar
establishments
even
to
the
for
a
little
world
lay
within
the
limits
of
the
city
we
passed
a
varied
strange
spectacle
which
changed
at
every
step
and
with
the
enjoyment
of
which
our
childish
curiosity
was
never
satisfied
in
fact
the
celebrated
when
he
lifted
the
roofs
of
madrid
at
night
scarcely
did
more
for
his
friend
than
was
here
done
for
us
in
the
bright
sunshine
and
open
air
the
keys
that
were
to
be
made
use
of
in
this
journey
to
gain
us
a
passage
through
many
a
tower
stair
and
postern
were
in
the
hands
of
the
authorities
whose
subordinates
we
never
failed
to
coax
into
the
but
a
more
important
and
in
one
sense
more
fruitful
place
for
us
was
the
named
from
the
romans
in
its
lower
halls
we
liked
but
too
well
to
lose
ourselves
we
obtained
an
entrance
too
into
the
large
and
very
simple
of
the
council
the
walls
as
well
as
the
arched
ceiling
were
white
though
wainscotted
to
a
certain
height
and
the
whole
was
without
a
trace
of
painting
or
any
kind
of
carved
work
only
high
up
on
the
middle
wall
might
be
read
this
brief
inscription
one
man
word
is
no
man
word
justice
needs
that
both
be
heard
after
the
most
ancient
fashion
benches
were
ranged
around
the
wainscotting
and
raised
one
step
above
the
floor
for
the
accommodation
of
the
members
of
the
assembly
this
readily
suggested
to
us
why
the
order
of
rank
in
our
senate
was
distributed
by
benches
to
the
left
of
the
door
on
the
opposite
corner
sat
the
in
the
corner
itself
the
who
alone
had
a
small
table
before
him
those
of
the
second
bench
sat
in
the
space
to
his
left
as
far
as
the
wall
to
where
the
windows
were
while
along
the
windows
ran
the
third
bench
occupied
by
the
craftsmen
in
the
midst
of
the
hall
stood
a
table
for
the
registrar
once
within
the
we
even
mingled
with
the
crowd
at
the
audiences
of
the
burgomasters
but
whatever
related
to
the
election
and
coronation
of
the
emperors
possessed
a
greater
charm
we
managed
to
gain
the
favour
of
the
keepers
so
as
to
be
allowed
to
mount
the
new
gay
imperial
staircase
which
was
painted
in
fresco
and
on
other
occasions
closed
with
a
grating
the
with
its
purple
hangings
and
gold
borders
filled
us
with
awe
the
representations
of
animals
on
which
little
children
or
genii
clothed
in
the
imperial
ornaments
and
laden
with
the
insignia
of
the
empire
made
a
curious
figure
were
observed
by
us
with
great
attention
and
we
even
hoped
that
we
might
live
to
see
some
time
or
other
a
coronation
with
our
own
eyes
they
had
great
difficulty
to
get
us
out
of
the
great
imperial
hall
when
we
had
been
once
fortunate
enough
to
steal
in
and
we
reckoned
him
our
truest
friend
who
while
we
looked
at
the
of
all
the
emperors
painted
around
at
a
certain
height
would
tell
us
something
of
their
deeds
we
listened
to
many
a
legend
of
charlemagne
but
that
which
was
historically
interesting
for
us
began
with
rudolph
of
hapsburg
who
by
his
courage
put
an
end
to
such
violent
commotions
charles
the
fourth
also
attracted
our
notice
we
had
already
heard
of
the
golden
bull
and
of
the
statutes
for
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
we
knew
too
that
he
had
not
made
the
frankforters
suffer
for
their
adhesion
to
his
noble
rival
emperor
günther
of
schwarzburg
we
heard
maximilian
praised
both
as
a
friend
to
mankind
and
to
the
townsmen
his
subjects
and
were
also
told
that
it
had
been
prophesied
of
him
he
would
be
the
last
emperor
of
a
german
house
which
unhappily
came
to
pass
as
after
his
death
the
choice
wavered
only
between
the
king
of
spain
charles
and
the
king
of
france
francis
i
with
some
anxiety
it
was
added
that
a
similar
prophecy
or
rather
intimation
was
once
more
in
circulation
for
it
was
obvious
that
there
was
room
left
for
the
portrait
of
only
one
more
emperor
a
circumstance
which
though
seemingly
accidental
filled
the
patriotic
with
concern
having
once
entered
upon
this
circuit
we
did
not
fail
to
repair
to
the
cathedral
and
there
visit
the
grave
of
that
brave
günther
so
much
prized
both
by
friend
and
foe
the
famous
stone
which
formerly
covered
it
is
set
up
in
the
choir
the
door
close
by
leading
into
the
conclave
remained
long
shut
against
us
until
we
at
last
managed
through
the
higher
authorities
to
gain
access
to
this
celebrated
place
but
we
should
have
done
better
had
we
continued
as
before
to
picture
it
merely
in
our
imagination
for
we
found
this
room
which
is
so
remarkable
in
german
history
where
the
most
powerful
princes
were
accustomed
to
meet
for
an
act
so
momentous
in
no
respect
worthily
adorned
and
even
disfigured
with
beams
poles
scaffolding
and
similar
lumber
which
people
had
wanted
to
put
out
of
the
way
the
imagination
for
that
very
reason
was
the
more
excited
and
the
heart
elevated
when
we
soon
after
received
permission
to
be
present
in
the
at
the
exhibition
of
the
golden
bull
to
some
distinguished
strangers
imperial
coronations
the
boy
then
heard
with
much
curiosity
what
his
own
family
as
well
as
other
older
relations
and
acquaintances
liked
to
tell
and
repeat
the
histories
of
the
two
last
coronations
which
had
followed
close
upon
each
other
for
there
was
no
frankforter
of
a
certain
age
who
would
not
have
regarded
these
two
events
and
their
attendant
circumstances
as
the
crowning
glory
of
his
whole
life
splendid
as
had
been
the
coronation
of
charles
seventh
during
which
particularly
the
french
ambassador
had
given
magnificent
feasts
at
great
cost
and
with
distinguished
taste
the
results
were
all
the
more
afflicting
to
the
good
emperor
who
could
not
preserve
his
capital
munich
and
was
compelled
in
some
degree
to
implore
the
hospitality
of
his
imperial
towns
if
the
coronation
of
francis
first
was
not
so
strikingly
splendid
as
the
former
one
it
was
dignified
by
the
presence
of
the
empress
maria
theresa
whose
beauty
appears
to
have
created
as
much
impression
on
the
men
as
the
earnest
and
noble
form
and
the
blue
eyes
of
charles
seventh
on
the
women
at
any
rate
the
sexes
rivalled
each
other
in
giving
to
the
attentive
boy
a
highly
favourable
opinion
of
both
these
personages
all
these
descriptions
and
narratives
were
given
in
a
serene
and
quiet
state
of
mind
for
the
peace
of
had
for
the
moment
put
an
end
to
all
feuds
and
they
spoke
at
their
ease
of
past
contests
as
well
as
of
their
former
festivities
the
battle
of
dettingen
for
instance
and
other
remarkable
events
of
years
and
all
that
was
important
or
dangerous
seemed
as
generally
happens
when
a
peace
has
been
concluded
to
have
occurred
only
to
afford
entertainment
to
prosperous
and
unconcerned
people
half
a
year
had
scarcely
passed
away
in
this
narrow
patriotism
before
the
fairs
began
which
always
produced
an
incredible
ferment
in
the
heads
of
all
children
the
erection
in
so
short
a
time
of
so
many
booths
creating
a
new
town
within
the
old
one
the
roll
and
crush
the
unloading
and
unpacking
of
wares
excited
from
the
very
first
dawn
of
consciousness
an
insatiable
active
curiosity
and
a
boundless
desire
for
childish
property
which
the
boy
with
increasing
years
endeavoured
to
gratify
in
one
way
or
another
as
far
as
his
little
purse
permitted
at
the
same
time
he
obtained
a
notion
of
what
the
world
produces
what
it
wants
and
what
the
inhabitants
of
its
different
parts
exchange
with
each
other
these
great
epochs
which
came
round
regularly
in
spring
and
autumn
were
announced
by
curious
solemnities
which
seemed
the
more
dignified
because
they
vividly
brought
before
us
the
old
time
and
what
had
come
down
from
it
to
ourselves
on
the
whole
population
were
on
their
legs
thronging
to
the
to
the
bridge
and
beyond
all
the
windows
were
occupied
though
nothing
unusual
took
place
on
that
day
the
crowd
seeming
to
be
there
only
for
the
sake
of
jostling
each
other
and
the
spectators
merely
to
look
at
one
another
for
the
real
occasion
of
their
coming
did
not
begin
till
nightfall
and
was
then
rather
taken
upon
trust
than
seen
with
the
eyes
the
affair
was
thus
in
those
old
unquiet
times
when
every
one
did
wrong
according
to
his
pleasure
or
helped
the
right
as
his
liking
led
him
traders
on
their
way
to
the
fairs
were
so
wilfully
beset
and
harassed
by
waylayers
both
of
noble
and
ignoble
birth
that
princes
and
other
persons
of
power
caused
their
people
to
be
accompanied
to
frankfort
by
an
armed
escort
now
the
burghers
of
the
imperial
city
would
yield
no
rights
pertaining
to
themselves
or
their
district
they
went
out
to
meet
the
advancing
party
and
thus
contests
often
arose
as
to
how
far
the
escort
should
advance
or
whether
it
had
a
right
to
enter
the
city
at
all
but
as
this
took
place
not
only
in
regard
to
matters
of
trade
and
fairs
but
also
when
high
personages
came
in
times
of
peace
or
war
and
especially
on
the
days
of
election
and
as
the
affair
often
came
to
blows
when
a
train
which
was
not
to
be
endured
in
the
city
strove
to
make
its
way
in
along
with
its
lord
many
negotiations
had
from
time
to
time
been
resorted
to
and
many
temporary
arrangements
concluded
though
always
with
reservations
of
rights
on
both
sides
the
hope
had
not
been
relinquished
of
composing
once
for
all
a
quarrel
that
had
already
lasted
for
centuries
inasmuch
as
the
whole
institution
on
account
of
which
it
had
been
so
long
and
often
so
hotly
contested
might
be
looked
upon
as
nearly
useless
or
at
least
as
superfluous
meanwhile
on
those
days
the
city
cavalry
in
several
divisions
each
having
a
commander
in
front
rode
forth
from
different
gates
and
found
on
a
certain
spot
some
troopers
or
hussars
of
the
persons
entitled
to
an
escort
who
with
their
leaders
were
well
received
and
entertained
they
stayed
till
towards
evening
and
then
rode
back
to
the
city
scarcely
visible
to
the
expectant
crowd
many
a
city
knight
not
being
in
a
condition
to
manage
his
horse
or
keep
himself
in
the
saddle
the
most
important
bands
returned
by
the
where
the
pressure
was
consequently
the
strongest
last
of
all
just
as
night
fell
the
nuremberg
arrived
escorted
in
the
same
way
and
always
containing
as
the
people
fancied
in
pursuance
of
custom
an
old
woman
its
arrival
therefore
was
a
signal
for
all
the
urchins
to
break
out
into
an
shout
though
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
distinguish
any
one
of
the
passengers
within
the
throng
that
pressed
after
the
coach
through
the
was
quite
incredible
and
perfectly
bewildering
to
the
senses
the
houses
nearest
the
bridge
were
those
therefore
most
in
demand
among
spectators
the
piper
court
another
more
singular
ceremony
by
which
the
people
were
excited
in
broad
daylight
was
the
it
commemorated
those
early
times
when
important
larger
endeavoured
if
not
to
abolish
tolls
altogether
at
least
to
bring
about
a
reduction
of
them
as
they
increased
in
proportion
with
trade
and
industry
they
were
allowed
this
privilege
by
the
emperor
who
needed
their
aid
when
it
was
in
his
power
to
grant
it
but
commonly
only
for
one
year
so
that
it
had
to
be
annually
renewed
this
was
effected
by
means
of
symbolical
gifts
which
were
presented
before
the
opening
of
bartholomew
fair
to
the
imperial
magistrate
who
might
have
sometimes
been
the
chief
and
for
the
sake
of
a
more
imposing
show
the
gifts
were
offered
when
he
was
sitting
in
full
court
with
the
but
when
the
chief
magistrate
afterwards
came
to
be
no
longer
appointed
by
the
emperor
and
was
elected
by
the
city
itself
he
still
retained
these
privileges
and
thus
both
the
immunities
of
the
cities
from
toll
and
the
ceremonies
by
which
the
representatives
from
worms
nuremberg
and
old
bamberg
once
acknowledged
the
ancient
favour
had
come
down
to
our
times
the
day
before
an
open
court
was
proclaimed
in
an
enclosed
space
in
the
great
imperial
hail
the
schöffen
took
their
elevated
seats
a
step
higher
sat
the
in
the
midst
of
them
while
below
on
the
right
hand
were
the
procurators
of
both
parties
invested
with
plenipotentiary
powers
the
begins
to
read
aloud
the
weighty
judgments
reserved
for
this
day
the
lawyers
demand
copies
appeal
or
do
whatever
else
seems
necessary
all
at
once
a
singular
sort
of
music
announces
if
we
may
so
speak
the
advent
of
former
centuries
it
proceeds
from
three
pipers
one
of
whom
plays
an
old
another
a
and
the
third
a
or
oboe
they
wear
blue
mantles
trimmed
with
gold
having
the
notes
made
fast
to
their
sleeves
and
their
heads
covered
having
thus
left
their
inn
at
ten
followed
by
the
deputies
and
their
attendants
and
stared
at
by
all
natives
and
strangers
they
enter
the
hall
the
law
proceedings
are
stayed
the
pipers
and
their
train
halt
before
the
railing
the
deputy
steps
in
and
stations
himself
in
front
of
the
the
emblematic
presents
which
were
required
to
be
precisely
the
same
as
in
the
old
precedents
consisted
commonly
of
the
staple
wares
of
the
city
offering
them
pepper
passed
as
it
were
for
everything
else
and
even
on
this
occasion
the
deputy
brought
a
handsomely
turned
wooden
goblet
filled
with
pepper
upon
it
lay
a
pair
of
gloves
curiously
slashed
stitched
and
tasseled
with
silk
a
token
of
a
favour
granted
and
received
such
as
the
emperor
himself
made
use
of
in
certain
cases
along
with
this
was
a
white
staff
which
in
former
times
was
not
easily
dispensable
in
judicial
proceedings
some
small
pieces
of
silver
money
were
added
and
the
city
of
worms
brought
an
old
felt
hat
which
was
always
redeemed
again
so
that
the
same
one
had
been
a
witness
of
these
ceremonies
for
many
years
after
the
deputy
had
made
his
address
handed
over
his
present
and
received
from
the
assurance
of
continued
favour
he
quitted
the
enclosed
circle
the
pipers
blew
the
train
departed
as
it
had
come
the
court
pursued
its
business
until
the
second
and
at
last
the
third
deputy
had
been
introduced
for
each
came
some
time
after
the
other
partly
that
the
pleasure
of
the
public
might
thus
be
prolonged
and
partly
because
they
were
always
the
same
antiquated
whom
nuremberg
for
itself
and
its
had
undertaken
to
maintain
and
produce
annually
at
the
appointed
place
summer
amusements
we
children
were
particularly
interested
in
this
festival
because
we
were
not
a
little
flattered
to
see
our
grandfather
in
a
place
of
so
much
honour
and
because
commonly
on
the
day
we
used
to
visit
him
quite
modestly
in
order
that
we
might
when
my
grandmother
had
emptied
the
pepper
into
her
spice
box
lay
hold
of
a
cup
or
small
rod
a
pair
of
gloves
or
an
old
these
symbolical
ceremonies
restoring
antiquity
as
if
by
magic
could
not
be
explained
to
us
without
leading
us
back
into
past
times
and
informing
us
of
the
manners
customs
and
feelings
of
those
early
ancestors
who
were
so
strangely
made
present
to
us
by
pipers
and
deputies
seemingly
risen
from
the
dead
and
by
tangible
gifts
which
might
be
possessed
by
ourselves
these
venerable
solemnities
were
followed
in
the
fine
season
by
many
festivals
delightful
for
us
children
which
took
place
in
the
open
air
outside
of
the
city
on
the
right
shore
of
the
maine
going
down
about
half
an
hour
walk
from
the
gate
there
rises
a
neatly
enclosed
and
surrounded
by
aged
lindens
not
far
from
it
stands
the
formerly
a
hospital
erected
for
the
sake
of
the
waters
on
the
commons
around
the
herds
of
cattle
from
the
neighbourhood
were
collected
on
a
certain
day
of
the
year
and
the
herdsmen
together
with
their
sweethearts
celebrated
a
rural
festival
with
dancing
and
singing
with
all
sorts
of
pleasure
and
clownishness
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
lay
a
similar
but
larger
common
likewise
graced
with
a
spring
and
still
finer
lindens
thither
at
whitsuntide
the
flocks
of
sheep
were
driven
and
at
the
same
time
the
poor
pale
orphan
children
were
allowed
to
come
out
of
their
walls
into
the
open
air
for
the
thought
had
not
yet
occurred
that
these
destitute
creatures
who
must
some
time
or
other
help
themselves
through
the
world
ought
soon
to
be
brought
in
contact
with
it
that
instead
of
being
kept
in
dreary
confinement
they
should
rather
be
accustomed
to
serve
and
to
endure
and
that
there
was
every
reason
to
strengthen
them
physically
and
morally
from
their
infancy
the
nurses
and
maids
always
ready
to
hike
a
walk
never
failed
to
carry
or
conduct
us
to
such
places
even
in
our
first
years
so
that
these
rural
festivals
belong
to
the
earliest
impressions
that
i
can
recall
meanwhile
our
house
had
been
finished
and
that
too
in
tolerably
short
time
because
everything
had
been
judiciously
planned
and
prepared
and
the
needful
money
provided
we
now
found
ourselves
all
together
again
and
felt
comfortable
for
when
a
plan
is
once
carried
out
we
forget
he
various
inconveniences
of
the
means
that
were
necessary
to
its
accomplishment
the
building
for
a
private
residence
was
roomy
enough
light
and
cheerful
throughout
with
broad
staircases
agreeable
parlours
and
a
prospect
of
the
gardens
that
could
be
enjoyed
easily
from
several
of
the
windows
the
internal
completion
and
what
pertained
to
mere
ornament
and
finish
was
gradually
accomplished
and
served
at
the
same
time
for
occupation
and
amusement
the
first
thing
brought
into
order
was
my
father
collection
of
books
the
best
of
which
in
calf
and
binding
were
to
ornament
the
walls
of
his
office
and
study
he
possessed
the
beautiful
dutch
editions
of
the
latin
classics
which
for
the
sake
of
outward
uniformity
he
had
endeavoured
to
procure
all
in
quarto
and
also
many
other
works
relating
to
roman
antiquities
and
the
more
elegant
jurisprudence
the
most
eminent
italian
poets
were
not
wanting
and
for
tasso
he
showed
a
great
predilection
there
were
also
the
best
and
most
recent
travels
and
he
took
great
delight
in
correcting
and
completing
keyssler
and
nemeiz
from
them
nor
had
he
omitted
to
surround
himself
with
all
needful
assistants
to
learning
such
as
dictionaries
of
various
languages
and
encyclopedias
of
science
and
art
which
with
much
else
adapted
to
profit
and
amusement
might
be
consulted
at
will
the
other
half
of
this
collection
in
neat
parchment
bindings
with
very
beautifully
written
titles
was
placed
in
a
separate
attic
the
acquisition
of
new
books
as
well
as
their
binding
and
arrangement
he
pursued
with
great
composure
and
love
of
order
and
he
was
much
influenced
in
his
opinion
by
the
critical
notices
that
ascribed
particular
merit
to
any
work
his
collection
of
juridical
treatises
was
annually
increased
by
some
volumes
next
the
pictures
which
in
the
old
house
had
hung
about
promiscuously
were
now
collected
and
symmetrically
hung
on
the
walls
of
a
cheerful
room
near
the
study
all
in
black
frames
set
off
with
gilt
mouldings
my
father
had
a
principle
which
he
often
and
strongly
expressed
that
one
ought
to
employ
the
living
masters
and
to
spend
less
upon
the
departed
in
the
estimation
of
whom
prejudice
greatly
concurred
he
had
the
notion
that
it
was
precisely
the
same
with
pictures
as
with
rhenish
wines
which
though
age
may
impart
to
them
a
higher
value
can
be
produced
in
any
coming
year
of
just
as
excellent
quality
as
in
years
past
after
the
lapse
of
some
time
the
new
wine
also
becomes
old
quite
as
valuable
and
perhaps
more
delicious
this
opinion
he
chiefly
confirmed
by
the
observation
that
many
old
pictures
seemed
to
derive
their
chief
value
for
lovers
of
art
from
the
fact
that
they
had
become
darker
and
browner
and
that
the
harmony
of
tone
in
such
pictures
was
often
vaunted
my
father
on
the
other
hand
protested
that
he
had
no
fear
that
the
new
pictures
would
not
also
turn
black
in
time
though
whether
they
were
likely
to
gain
anything
by
this
he
was
not
so
positive
frankfurt
artists
in
pursuance
of
these
principles
he
employed
for
many
years
the
whole
of
the
frankfort
artists
the
painter
hirt
who
excelled
in
animating
oak
and
beech
woods
and
other
rural
scenes
with
cattle
trautmann
who
had
adopted
rembrandt
as
his
model
and
had
attained
great
perfection
in
inclosed
lights
and
reflections
as
well
as
in
effective
conflagrations
so
that
he
was
once
ordered
to
paint
a
to
a
rembrandt
schütz
who
diligently
elaborated
landscapes
of
the
rhine
country
in
the
manner
of
sachtlebens
and
junker
who
executed
with
great
purity
flower
and
fruit
pieces
still
life
and
figures
quietly
employed
after
the
models
of
the
dutch
but
now
by
the
new
arrangement
by
more
convenient
room
and
still
more
by
the
acquaintance
of
a
skilful
artist
our
love
of
art
was
again
quickened
and
animated
this
artist
was
seekatz
a
pupil
of
brinkmann
at
darmstadt
whose
talent
and
character
will
be
more
minutely
unfolded

the
sequel

this
way
the
remaining
rooms
were
finished
according
to
their
several
purposes
cleanliness
and
order
prevailed
throughout
above
all
the
large
panes
of
contributed
towards
a
perfect
lightness
which
had
been
wanting
in
the
old
house
for
many
causes
but
chiefly
on
account
of
the
panes
which
were
for
the
most
part
round
my
father
was
cheerful
on
account
of
the
success
of
his
undertaking
and
if
his
good
humour
had
not
been
often
interrupted
because
the
diligence
and
exactness
of
the
mechanics
did
not
come
up
to
his
wishes
a
happier
life
than
ours
could
not
have
been
conceived
since
much
good
partly
arose
in
the
family
itself
and
partly
flowed
from
without
but
an
extraordinary
event
deeply
disturbed
the
boy
peace
of
mind
for
the
first
time
on
the
of
november
the
earthquake
at
lisbon
took
place
and
spread
a
prodigious
alarm
over
the
world
long
accustomed
to
peace
and
quiet
a
great
and
magnificent
capital
which
was
at
the
same
time
a
trading
and
mercantile
city
is
smitten
without
warning
by
a
most
fearful
calamity
the
earth
trembles
and
totters
the
sea
roars
up
ships
dash
together
houses
fall
in
and
over
them
churches
and
towers
the
royal
palace
is
in
part
swallowed
by
the
waters
the
bursting
land
seems
to
vomit

since
smoke
and
fire
are
seen
everywhere
amid
the
ruins
sixty
thousand
persons
a
moment
before
in
case
and
comfort
fall
together
and
he
is
to
be
deemed
most
fortunate
who
is
no
longer
capable
of
a

or

about
the
disaster
the

rage
on

and
every
outrage

thus
on

asserts
her
boundless
capriciousness
earthquake
at
lisbon
intimations
of
this
event
had
spread
over
wide
regions
more
quickly
than
the
authentic
reports
slight
shocks
had
been
felt
in
many
places
in
many
springs
particularly
those
of
a
mineral
nature
an
unusual
receding
of
the
waters
had
been
remarked
and
so
much
the
greater
was
the
effect
of
the
accounts
themselves
which
were
rapidly
circulated
at
first
in
general
terms
but
finally
with
dreadful
particulars
hereupon
the
religious
were
neither
wanting
in
reflections
nor
the
philosophic
in
grounds
for
consolation
nor
the
clergy
in
warnings
so
complicated
an
event
arrested
the
attention
of
the
world
for
a
long
time
and
as
additional
and
more
detailed
accounts
of
the
extensive
effects
of
this
explosion
came
from
every
quarter
the
minds
already
aroused
by
the
misfortunes
of
strangers
began
to
be
more
and
more
anxious
about
themselves
and
their
friends
perhaps
the
demon
of
terror
had
never
so
speedily
and
powerfully
diffused
his
terrors
over
the
earth
the
boy
who
was
compelled
to
put
up
with
frequent
repetitions
of
the
whole
matter
was
not
a
little
staggered
god
the
creator
and
preserver
of
heaven
and
earth
whom
the
explanation
of
the
first
article
of
the
creed
declared
so
wise
and
benignant
having
given
both
the
just
and
the
unjust
a
prey
to
the
same
destruction
had
not
manifested
himself
by
any
means
in
a
fatherly
character
in
vain
the
young
mind
strove
to
resist
these
impressions
it
was
the
more
impossible
as
the
wise
and
could
not
themselves
agree
as
to
the
light
in
which
such
a
phenomenon
should
be
regarded
the
next
summer
gave
a
closer
opportunity
of
knowing
directly
that
angry
god
of
whom
the
old
testament
records
so
much
a
sudden
accompanied
by
thunder
and
lightning
violently
broke
the
new
panes
at
the
back
of
our
house
which
looked
towards
the
west
damaged
the
new
furniture
destroyed
some
valuable
books
and
other
things
of
worth
and
was
the
more
terrible
to
the
children
as
the
whole
household
quite
beside
themselves
dragged
them
into
a
dark
passage
where
on
their
knees
with
frightful
groans
and
cries
they
thought
to
conciliate
the
wrathful
deity
meanwhile
my
father
who
was
alone
forced
open
and
unhinged
the
by
which
we
saved
much
glass
but
made
a
broader
inlet
for
the
rain
that
followed
the
hail
so
that
after
we
were
finally
quieted
we
found
ourselves
in
the
rooms
and
on
the
stairs
completely
surrounded
by
floods
and
streams
of
water
these
events
startling
as
they
were
on
the
whole
did
not
greatly
interrupt
the
course
of
instruction
which
my
father
himself
had
undertaken
to
give
us
children
he
had
passed
his
youth
in
the
cobourg
gymnasium
which
stood
as
one
of
the
first
among
german
educational
institutions
he
had
there
laid
a
good
foundation
in
languages
and
other
matters
reckoned
part
of
a
learned
education
had
subsequently
applied
himself
to
jurisprudence
at
leipzig
and
had
at
last
taken
his
degree
at
giessen
his
dissertation
de
aditione
which
had
been
earnestly
and
carefully
written
is
yet
cited
by
jurists
with
approval
it
is
a
pious
wish
of
all
fathers
to
see
what
they
have
themselves
failed
to
attain
realized
in
their
sons
as
if
in
this
way
they
could
live
their
lives
over
again
and
at
last
make
a
proper
use
of
their
early
experience
conscious
of
his
acquirements
with
the
certainty
of
faithful
perseverance
and
distrusting
the
teachers
of
the
day
my
father
undertook
to
instruct
his
own
children
allowing
them
to
take
particular
lesson
from
particular
masters
only
so
far
as
seemed
absolutely
necessary
a
pedagogical
was
already
beginning
to
show
itself
everywhere
the
pedantry
and
heaviness
of
the
masters
appointed
in
the
public
schools
had
probably
given
rise
to
this
evil
something
better
was
sought
for
but
it
was
forgotten
how
defective
all
instruction
must
be
which
is
not
given
by
persons
who
are
teachers
by
profession
my
father
had
prospered
in
his
own
career
tolerably
according
to
his
wishes
i
was
to
follow
the
same
course
only
more
easily
and
much
farther
he
prized
my
natural
endowments
the
more
because
he
was
himself
wanting
in
them
for
he
had
acquired
everything
only
by
means
of
unspeakable
diligence
pertinacity
and
repetition
he
often
assured
me
early
and
late
both
in
jest
and
earnest
that
with
my
talents
he
would
have
deported
himself
very
differently
and
would
not
have
turned
them
to
such
small
account
juvenile
studies
by
means
of
a
ready
apprehension
practice
and
a
good
memory
i
very
soon
outgrew
the
instructions
which
my
father
and
the
other
teachers
were
able
to
give
without
being
thoroughly
grounded
in
anything
grammar
displeased
me
because
i
regarded
it
as
a
mere
arbitrary
law
the
rules
seemed
ridiculous
inasmuch
as
they
were
invalidated
by
so
many
exceptions
which
had
all
to
be
learned
by
themselves
and
if
the
first
latin
work
had
not
been
in
rhyme
i
should
have
got
on
but
badly
in
that
but
as
it
was
i
hummed
and
sang
it
to
myself
readily
enough
in
the
same
way
we
had
a
geography
in
in
which
the
most
wretched
doggerel
best
served
to
fix
the
recollection
of
that
which
was
to
be
retained
has
many
a
fen
which
makes
it
hateful
to
all
men
the
forms
and
inflections
of
language
i
caught
with
ease
and
i
also
quickly
unravelled
what
lay
in
the
conception
of
a
thing
in
rhetoric
composition
and
such
matters
no
one
excelled
me
although
i
was
often
put
back
for
faults
of
grammar
yet
these
were
the
attempts
that
gave
my
father
particular
pleasure
and
for
which
he
rewarded
me
with
many
presents
of
money
considerable
for
such
a
lad
my
father
taught
my
sister
italian
in
the
same
room
in
which
i
had
to
commit
cellarius
to
memory
as
i
was
soon
ready
with
my
task
and
was
yet
obliged
to
sit
quiet
i
listened
with
my
book
before
me
and
very
readily
caught
the
italian
which
struck
me
as
an
agreeable
softening
of
latin
other
precocities
with
respect
to
memory
and
the
power
to
combine
i
possessed
in
common
with
those
children
who
thus
acquire
an
early
reputation
for
that
reason
my
father
could
scarcely
wait
for
me
to
go
to
college
he
very
soon
declared
that
i
must
study
jurisprudence
in
leipzig
for
which
he
retained
a
strong
predilection
and
i
was
afterwards
to
visit
some
other
university
and
take
my
degree
as
for
this
second
one
he
was
indifferent
which
i
might
choose
except
that
he
had
for
some
reason
or
other
a
disinclination
to
göttingen
to
my
disappointment
since
it
was
precisely
there
that
i
had
placed
such
confidence
and
high
hopes
he
told
me
further
that
i
was
to
go
to
wetzlar
and
ratisbon
as
well
as
to
vienna
and
thence
towards
italy
although
he
repeatedly
mentioned
that
paris
should
first
be
seen
because
after
coming
out
of
italy
nothing
else
could
be
pleasing
these
tales
of
my
future
youthful
travels
often
as
they
were
repeated
i
listened
to
eagerly
the
more
since
they
always
led
to
accounts
of
italy
and
at
last
to
a
description
of
naples
his
otherwise
serious
and
dry
manner
seemed
on
these
occasions
to
relax
and
quicken
and
thus
a
passionate
wish
awoke
in
us
children
to
participate
in
the
paradise
he
described
private
lessons
which
now
gradually
multiplied
were
shared
with
the
children
of
the
neighbours
this
learning
in
common
did
not
advance
me
the
teachers
followed
their
routine
and
the
rudeness
sometimes
the
of
my
companions
interrupted
the
brief
hours
of
study
with
tumult
vexation
and
disturbance
chrestomathies
by
which
learn
learning
is
made
pleasant
and
varied

not
yet

us
cornelius
nepos
so
dry
to
young
people
the
new
testament
which
was
much
too
easy
and
which
by
preaching
and
religious
instructions
had
been
rendered
even
cellarius
and
pasor
could
impart
no
kind
of
interest
on
the
other
hand
a
certain
rage
for
rhyme
and
versification
a
consequence
of
reading
the
prevalent
german
poets
took
complete
possession
of
us
me
it
had
seized
much
earlier
as
i
had
found
it
agreeable
to
pass
from
the
rhetorical
to
the
poetical
treatment
of
subjects
we
boys
held
a
sunday
assembly
where
each
of
us
was
to
produce
original
verses
and
here
i
was
struck
by
something
strange
which
long
caused
me
uneasiness
my
poems
whatever
they
might
be
always
seemed
to
me
the
best
but
i
soon
remarked
that
my
competitors
who
brought
forth
very
lame
affairs
were
in
the
same
condition
and
thought
no
less
of
themselves
nay
what
appeared
yet
more
suspicious
a
good
lad
though
in
such
matters
altogether
unskilful
whom
i
liked
in
other
respects
but
who
had
his
rhymes
made
by
his
tutor
not
only
regarded
these
as
the
best
but
was
thoroughly
persuaded
they
were
his
own
as
he
always
maintained
in
our
confidential
intercourse
now
as
this
illusion
and
error
was
obvious
to
me
the
question
one
day
forced
itself
upon
me
whether
i
myself
might
not
be
in
the
same
state
whether
those
poems
were
not
really
better
than
mine
and
whether
i
might
not
justly
appear
to
those
boys
as
mad
as
they
to
me
this
disturbed
me
much
and
long
for
it
was
altogether
impossible
for
me
to
find
any
external
criterion
of
the
truth
i
even
ceased
from
producing
until
at
length
i
was
quieted
by
my
own
light
temperament
and
the
feeling
of
my
own
powers
and
lastly
by
a
trial
of
skill
started
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
by
our
teachers
and
parents
who
had
noted
our
sport
in
which
i
came
off
well
and
won
general
praise
no
libraries
for
children
had
at
that
time
been
established
the
old
had
themselves
still
childish
notions
and
found
it
convenient
to
impart
their
own
education
to
their
successors
except
the
of
amos
comenius
no
book
of
the
sort
fell
into
our
hands
but
the
large
folio
bible
with
copperplates
by
merian
was
diligently
gone
over
leaf
by
leaf
gottfried
chronicles
with
plates
by
the
same
master
taught
us
the
most
notable
events
of
universal
history
the
added
thereto
all
sorts
of
fables
mythologies
and
wonders
and
as
i
soon
became
familiar
with
ovid
metamorphoses
the
first
books
of
which
in
particular
i
studied
carefully
my
young
brain
was
rapidly
furnished
with
a
mass
of
images
and
events
of
significant
and
wonderful
shapes
and
occurrences
and
i
never
felt
time
hang
upon
my
hands
as
i
always
occupied
myself
in
working
over
repeating
and
reproducing
these
acquisitions
popular
works
a
more
salutary
moral
effect
than
that
of
these
rude
and
hazardous
antiquities
was
produced
by
fénelon
with
which
i
first
became
acquainted
in
neukirch
translation
and
which
imperfectly
as
it
was
executed
had
a
sweet
and
beneficent
influence
on
my
mind
that
was
added
in
due
time
follows
in
the
nature
of
things
and
it
may
be
imagined
that
the
of
was
not
wanting
lord
anson
round
the
combined
the
dignity
of
truth
with
the
rich
fancies
of
fable
and
while
our
thoughts
accompanied
this
excellent
seaman
we
were
conducted
over
all
the
world
and
endeavoured
to
follow
him
with
our
fingers
on
the
globe
but
a
still
richer
harvest
was
to
spring
up
before
me
when
i
lighted
on
a
mass
of
writings
which
in
their
present
state
it
is
true
can
not
be
called
excellent
but
the
contents
of
which
in
a
harmless
way
bring
near
to
us
many
a
meritorious
action
of
former
times
the
publication
or
rather
the
manufacture
of
those
books
which
have
at
a
later
day
become
so
well
known
and
celebrated
under
the
name
popular
works
or
books
was
carried
on
in
frankfort
the
enormous
sales
they
met
with
led
to
their
being
almost
illegibly
printed
from
stereotypes
on
horrible
we
children
were
so
fortunate
as
to
find
these
precious
remains
of
the
middle
ages
every
day
on
a
little
table
at
the
door
of
a
dealer
in
cheap
books
and
to
obtain
them
at
the
cost
of
a
couple
of
the
eulenspiegel
the
four
sons
of
haimon
the
emperor
octavian
the
fair
melusina
the
beautiful
magelone
fortunatus
with
the
whole
race
down
to
the
wandering
jew
were
all
at
our
service
as
often
as
we
preferred
the
relish
of
these
works
to
the
taste
of
sweet
things
the
greatest
benefit
of
this
was
that
when
we
had
read
through
or
damaged
such
a
sheet
it
could
soon
be
reprocured
and
swallowed
a
second
time
as
a
family
in
summer
is
vexatiously
disturbed
by
a
sudden
storm
which
transforms
a
pleasant
state
of
things
into
the
very
reverse
so
the
diseases
of
childhood
fall
unexpectedly
on
the
most
beautiful
season
of
early
life
and
thus
it
happened
with
me
i
had
just
purchased
fortunatus
with
his
purse
and
when
i
was
attacked
by
a
restlessness
and
fever
which
announced
the
inoculation
was
still
with
us
considered
very
problematical
and
although
it
had
already
been
intelligibly
and
urgently
recommended
by
popular
writers
the
german
physicians
hesitated
to
perform
an
operation
that
seemed
to
forestall
nature
speculative
englishmen
therefore
had
come
to
the
continent
and
inoculated
for
a
considerable
fee
the
children
of
such
persons
as
were
opulent
and
free
from
prejudices
still
the
majority
were
exposed
to
the
old
disease
the
infection
raged
through
families
killed
and
disfigured
many
children
and
few
parents
dared
to
avail
themselves
of
a
method
the
probable
efficacy
of
which
had
been
abundantly
confirmed
by
the
result
the
evil
now
invaded
our
house
and
attacked
me
with
unusual
severity
my
whole
body
was
sown
over
with
spots
and
my
race
covered
and
for
several
days
i
lay
blind
and
in
great
pain
they
tried
the
only
possible
alleviation
and
promised
me
heaps
of
gold
if
i
would
keep
quiet
and
not
increase
the
mischief
by
rubbing
and
scratching
i
controlled
myself
while
according
to
the
prevailing
prejudice
they
kept
me
as
warm
as
possible
and
thus
only
rendered
my
suffering
more
acute
at
last
after
a
woful
time
there
fell
as
it
were
a
mask
from
my
face
the
blotches
had
left
no
visible
mark
upon
the
skin
but
the
features
were
plainly
altered
i
myself
was
satisfied
merely
with
seeing
the
light
of
day
again
and
gradually
putting
off
my
spotted
skin
but
others
were
pitiless
enough
to
remind
me
often
of
my
previous
condition
especially
a
very
lively
aunt
who
had
formerly
regarded
me
with
idolatry
but
in
after
years
could
seldom
look
at
me
without
exclaiming
the
deuce
cousin
what
a
fright
he
grown
then
she
would
tell
me
circumstantially
how
i
had
once
been
her
delight
and
what
attention
she
had
excited
when
she
carried
me
about
and
thus
i
early
learned
that
people
very
often
subject
us
to
a
severe
atonement
for
the
pleasure
which
we
have
afforded
them
diseases
of
childhood
i
neither
escaped
measles
nor
nor
any
other
of
the
tormenting
demons
of
childhood
and
i
was
assured
each
time
that
it
was
a
great
piece
of
good
luck
that
this
malady
was
now
past
for
ever
but
alas
another
again
threatened
in
the
and
advanced
all
these
things
increased
my
propensity
to
reflection
and
as
i
had
already
practised
myself
in
fortitude
in
order
to
remove
the
torture
of
impatience
the
virtues
which
i
had
heard
praised
in
the
stoics
appeared
to
me
highly
worthy
of
imitation
and
the
more
so
as
something
similar
was
commended
by
the
christian
doctrine
of
patience
while
on
the
subject
of
these
family
diseases
i
will
mention
a
brother
about
three
years
younger
than
myself
who
was
likewise
attacked
by
that
infection
and
suffered
not
a
little
from
it
he
was
of
a
tender
nature
quiet
and
capricious
and
we
were
never
on
the
most
friendly
terms
besides
he
scarcely
survived
the
years
of
childhood
among
several
other
children
born
afterwards
who
like
him
did
not
live
long
i
only
remember
a
very
pretty
and
agreeable
girl
who
also
soon
passed
away
so
that
after
the
lapse
of
some
years
my
sister
and
i
remained
alone
and
were
therefore
the
more
deeply
and
affectionately
attached
to
each
other
these
maladies
and
other
unpleasant
interruptions
were
in
their
consequences
doubly
grievous
for
my
father
who
seemed
to
have
laid
down
for
himself
a
certain
calendar
of
education
and
instruction
was
resolved
immediately
to
repair
every
delay
and
imposed
double
lessons
upon
the
young
convalescent
these
were
not
hard
for
me
to
accomplish
but
were
so
far
troublesome
that
they
hindered
and
to
a
certain
extent
repressed
my
inward
development
which
had
taken
a
decided
direction
from
these
didactic
and
pedagogic
oppressions
we
commonly
fled
to
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
their
house
stood
in
the
street
and
appeared
to
have
been
formerly
a
fortress
for
on
approaching
it
nothing
was
seen
but
a
large
gate
with
battlements
which
were
joined
on
either
side
to
the
two
neighbouring
houses
on
entering
through
a
narrow
passage
we
reached
at
last
a
tolerably
broad
court
surrounded
by
irregular
buildings
which
were
now
all
united
into
one
dwelling
we
usually
hastened
at
once
into
the
garden
which
extended
to
a
considerable
length
and
breadth
behind
the
buildings
and
was
very
well
kept
the
walks
were
mostly
skirted
by
vine
trellises
one
part
of
the
space
was
used
for
vegetables
and
another
devoted
to
flowers
which
from
spring
till
autumn
adorned
in
rich
succession
the
borders
as
well
as
the
beds
the
long
wall
erected
towards
the
south
was
used
for
some
espalier
the
forbidden
fruit
of
which
ripened
temptingly
before
us
through
the
summer
yet
we
rather
avoided
this
side
because
we
here
could
not
satisfy
our
dainty
appetites
and
we
turned
to
the
side
opposite
where
an
interminable
row
of
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
furnished
our
voracity
with
a
succession
of
harvests
till
autumn
not
less
important
to
us
was
an
old
high
both
on
account
of
its
fruits
and
because
we
were
told
that
the
fed
upon
its
leaves
in
this
peaceful
region
my
grandfather
was
found
every
evening
tending
with
genial
care
and
with
his
own
hand
the
finer
growths
of
fruits
and
flowers
while
a
gardener
managed
the
drudgery
he
was
never
vexed
by
the
various
toils
which
were
necessary
to
preserve
and
increase
a
fine
show
of
pinks
the
branches
of
the
were
carefully
tied
to
the
espaliers
with
his
own
hands
in
a
in
order
to
bring
about
a
full
and
easy
growth
of
the
fruit
the
sorting
of
the
bulbs
of
tulips
hyacinths
and
plants
of
a
similar
nature
as
well
as
the
care
of
their
preservation
he
entrusted
to
none
and
i
still
with
pleasure
recall
to
my
mind
how
diligently
he
occupied
himself
in
inoculating
the
different
varieties
of
roses
that
he
might
protect
himself
from
the
thorns
he
put
on
a
pair
of
those
ancient
leather
gloves
of
which
three
pair
were
given
him
annually
at
the
piper
court
so
that
there
was
no
dearth
of
the
article
he
wore
also
a
loose
and
a
folded
black
velvet
cap
upon
his
head
so
that
he
might
have
passed
for
an
intermediate
person
between
alcinoüs
and
laërtes
goethe
maternal
grandfather
all
this
work
in
the
garden
he
pursued
as
regularly
and
with
as
much
precision
as
his
official
business
for
before
he
came
down
he
always
arranged
the
list
of
causes
for
the
next
day
and
read
the
legal
papers
in
the
morning
he
proceeded
to
the
council
house
dined
after
his
return
then
nodded
in
his
easy
chair
and
so
went
through
the
same
routine
every
day
he
conversed
little
never
exhibited
any
vehemence
and
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
seen
him
angry
all
that
surrounded
him
was
in
the
fashion
of
the
olden
time
i
never
perceived
any
alteration
in
his
wainscotted
room
his
library
contained
besides
law
works
only
the
earliest
books
of
travels
sea
voyages
and
discoveries
of
countries
altogether
i
can
call
to
mind
no
situation
more
adapted
than
his
to
awaken
the
feeling
of
uninterrupted
peace
and
eternal
duration
but
the
reverence
which
we
entertained
for
this
venerable
old
man
was
raised
to
the
highest
degree
by
a
conviction
that
he
possessed
the
gift
of
prophecy
especially
in
matters
that
pertained
to
himself
and
his
destiny
it
is
true
he
revealed
himself
to
no
one
distinctly
and
minutely
except
to
my
grandmother
yet
we
were
all
aware
that
he
was
informed
of
what
was
going
to
happen
by
significant
dreams
he
assured
his
wife
for
instance
at
a
time
when
he
was
still
junior
councillor
that
on
the
first
vacancy
he
would
obtain
the
place
left
open
on
the
bench
of
the
and
soon
afterwards
when
one
of
those
officers
actually
died
of
apoplexy
my
grandfather
gave
orders
that
his
house
should
be
quietly
got
ready
prepared
on
the
day
of
electing
and
balloting
to
receive
his
guests
and
congratulators
sure
enough
the
decisive
gold
ball
was
drawn
in
his
favour
the
simple
dream
by
which
he
had
learned
this
he
confided
to
his
wife
as
follows
he
had
seen
himself
in
the
ordinary
full
assembly
of
councilmen
where
all
went
on
just
as
usual
suddenly
the
late
rose
from
his
seat
descended
the
steps
pressed
him
in
the
most
complimentary
manner
to
take
the
vacant
place
and
then
departed
by
the
door
something
like
this
occurred
on
the
death
of
the
they
make
no
delay
in
supplying
this
place
as
they
always
have
to
fear
that
the
emperor
will
at
some
time
resume
his
ancient
right
of
nominating
the
officer
on
this
occasion
the
messenger
of
the
court
came
at
midnight
to
summon
an
extraordinary
session
for
the
next
morning
and
as
the
light
in
his
lantern
was
about
to
expire
he
asked
for
a
candle
end
to
help
him
on
his
way
give
him
a
whole
one
said
my
grandfather
to
the
ladies
he
takes
the
trouble
all
on
my
account
this
expression
anticipated
the
result
he
was
made
and
what
rendered
the
circumstance
particularly
remarkable
was
that
although
his
representative
was
the
third
and
last
to
draw
at
the
ballot
the
two
silver
balls
first
came
out
leaving
the
golden
ball
at
the
bottom
of
the
bag
for
him
perfectly
prosaic
simple
and
without
a
trace
of
the
fantastic
or
miraculous
were
the
other
dreams
of
which
we
were
informed
moreover
i
remember
that
once
as
a
boy
i
was
turning
over
his
books
and
memoranda
and
found
among
some
other
remarks
which
related
to
gardening
such
sentences
as
these
came
to
me
and
said
the
name
and
revelation
being
written
in
cipher
or
this
night
i
saw
all
the
rest
being
again
in
cipher
except
the
conjunctions
and
similar
words
from
which
nothing
could
be
learned
it
is
worthy
of
note
also
that
persons
who
showed
no
signs
of
prophetic
insight
at
other
times
acquired
for
the
moment
while
in
his
presence
and
that
by
means
of
some
sensible
evidence
presentiments
of
diseases
or
deaths
which
were
then
occurring
in
distant
places
but
no
such
gift
has
been
transmitted
to
any
of
his
children
or
grandchildren
who
for
the
most
part
have
been
hearty
people
enjoying
life
and
never
going
beyond
the
actual
while
on
this
subject
i
remember
with
gratitude
many
kindnesses
i
received
from
them
in
my
youth
thus
for
example
we
were
employed
and
entertained
in
many
ways
when
we
visited
the
second
daughter
married
to
the
druggist
melbert
whose
house
and
shop
stood
near
the
market
in
the
midst
of
the
liveliest
and
most
crowded
part
of
the
town
there
we
could
look
down
from
the
windows
pleasantly
enough
upon
the
in
which
we
feared
to
lose
ourselves
and
though
at
first
of
all
the
goods
in
the
shop
nothing
had
much
interest
for
us
but
the
liquorice
and
the
little
brown
stamped
cakes
made
from
it
we
became
in
time
better
acquainted
with
the
multitude
of
articles
bought
and
sold
in
that
business
this
aunt
was
the
most
vivacious
of
all
the
family
when
my
mother
in
her
early
years
took
pleasure
in
being
neatly
dressed
working
at
some
domestic
occupation
or
reading
a
book
the
other
on
the
contrary
ran
about
the
neighbourhood
to
pick
up
neglected
children
take
care
of
them
comb
them
and
carry
them
round
as
indeed
she
did
me
for
a
good
while
at
a
time
of
public
festivities
such
as
coronations
it
was
impossible
to
keep
her
at
home
when
a
little
child
she
had
already
scrambled
for
the
money
scattered
on
such
occasions
and
it
was
related
of
her
that
once
when
she
had
got
a
good
many
together
and
was
looking
at
them
with
great
delight
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
it
was
struck
by
somebody
and
all
her
booty
vanished
at
a
blow
there
was
another
incident
of
which
she
was
very
proud
once
while
standing
on
a
post
as
the
emperor
charles
vii
was
passing
at
a
moment
when
all
the
people
were
silent
she
shouted
a
vigorous
vivat
into
the
coach
which
made
him
take
off
his
hat
to
her
and
thank
her
quite
graciously
for
her
bold
salutation
everything
in
her
house
was
stirring
lively
and
cheerful
and
we
children
owed
her
many
a
gay
hour
religious
instruction
in
a
quieter
situation
which
was
however
suited
to
her
character
was
a
second
aunt
married
to
the
pastor
stark
incumbent
of
catharine
church
he
lived
much
alone
in
accordance
with
his
temperament
and
vocation
and
possessed
a
fine
library
here
i
first
became
acquainted
with
homer
in
a
prose
translation
which
may
be
found
in
the
seventh
part
of
herr
von
loen
new
collection
of
the
most
remarkable
travels
under
the
title
description
of
the
conquest
of
the
kingdom
of
ornamented
with
in
the
theatrical
french
taste
these
pictures
perverted
my
imagination
to
such
a
degree
that
for
a
long
time
i
could
conceive
the
homeric
heroes
only
under
such
forms
the
incidents
themselves
gave
me
unspeakable
delight
though
i
found
great
fault
with
the
work
for
affording
us
no
account
of
the
capture
of
troy
and
breaking
off
so
abruptly
math
the
death
of
hector
my
uncle
to
whom
i
mentioned
this
defect
referred
me
to
virgil
who
perfectly
satisfied
my
demands
it
will
be
taken
for
granted
that
we
children
had
among
our
other
lessons
a
continued
and
progressive
instruction
in
religion
but
the
imparted
to
us
was
properly
speaking
nothing
but
a
kind
of
dry
morality
ingenious
exposition
was
not
thought
of
and
the
doctrine
appealed
neither
to
the
understanding
nor
to
the
heart
for
that
reason
there
were
various
secessions
from
the
established
church
separatists
pietists
herrnhuter
moravians
and
others
differently
named
and
characterized
sprang
up
all
of
whom
were
animated
by
the
same
purpose
of
approaching
the
deity
especially
through
christ
more
closely
than
seemed
to
them
possible
under
the
forms
of
the
established
religion
the
boy
heard
these
opinions
and
sentiments
constantly
spoken
of
for
the
clergy
as
well
as
the
laity
divided
themselves
into
and
the
minority
were
composed
of
those
who
dissented
more
or
less
broadly
but
their
modes
of
thinking
attracted
by
originality
heartiness
perseverance
and
independence
all
sorts
of
stories
were
told
of
their
virtues
and
of
the
way
in
which
they
were
manifested
the
reply
of
a
pious
was
especially
noted
who
when
one
of
his
craft
attempted
to
shame
him
by
asking
who
is
really
your
confessor
answered
with
great
cheerfulness
and
confidence
in
the
goodness
of
his
cause
i
have
a
famous
one
no
less
than
the
confessor
of
king
david
things
of
this
sort
naturally
made
an
impression
on
the
boy
and
led
him
into
similar
states
of
mind
in
fact
he
came
to
the
thought
that
he
might
immediately
approach
the
great
god
of
nature
the
creator
and
preserver
of
heaven
and
earth
whose
earlier
manifestations
of
wrath
had
been
long
forgotten
in
the
beauty
of
the
world
and
the
manifold
blessings
in
which
we
participate
while
upon
it
the
way
he
took
to
accomplish
this
was
very
curious
the
boy
had
chiefly
kept
to
the
first
article
of
belief
the
god
who
stands
in
immediate
connexion
with
nature
and
owns
and
loves
it
as
his
work
seemed
to
him
the
proper
god
who
might
be
brought
into
closer
relationship
with
man
as
with
everything
else
and
who
would
take
care
of
him
as
of
the
motion
of
the
stars
the
days
and
seasons
the
animals
and
plants
there
were
texts
of
the
gospels
which
explicitly
stated
this
the
boy
could
ascribe
no
form
to
this
being
he
therefore
sought
him
in
his
works
and
would
in
the
good
old
testament
fashion
build
him
an
altar
natural
productions
were
set
forth
as
images
of
the
world
over
which
a
flame
was
to
bum
signifying
the
aspirations
of
man
heart
towards
his
maker
he
brought
out
of
the
collection
of
natural
objects
which
he
possessed
and
which
had
been
increased
as
chance
directed
the
best
ores
and
other
specimens
the
but
the
next
difficulty
was
as
to
how
they
should
be
arranged
and
raised
into
a
pile
his
father
possessed
a
beautiful
ornamented
with
gilt
flowers
in
the
form
of
a
pyramid
with
different
elevations
which
had
been
found
convenient
for
quartets
but
lately
was
not
much
in
use
the
boy
laid
hands
on
this
and
built
up
his
representatives
of
nature
one
above
the
other
in
steps
so
that
it
all
looked
quite
pretty
and
at
the
same
time
sufficiently
significant
on
an
early
sunrise
his
first
worship
of
god
was
to
be
celebrated
but
the
young
priest
had
not
yet
settled
how
to
produce
a
flame
which
should
at
the
same
time
emit
an
agreeable
odour
at
last
it
occurred
to
him
to
combine
the
two
as
he
possessed
a
few
fumigating
pastils
which
diffused
a
pleasant
fragrance
with
a
glimmer
if
not
with
a
flame
nay
this
soft
burning
and
exhalation
seemed
a
better
representation
of
what
passes
in
the
heart
than
an
open
flame
the
sun
had
already
risen
for
a
long
time
but
the
neigbouring
houses
concealed
the
east
at
last
it
glittered
above
the
roofs
a
was
at
once
taken
up
and
applied
to
the
pastils
which
were
fixed
on
the
summit
in
a
fine
porcelain
saucer
everything
succeeded
according
to
the
wish
and
the
devotion
was
perfect
the
altar
remained
as
a
peculiar
ornament
of
the
room
which
had
been
assigned
him
in
the
new
house
every
one
regarded
it
only
as
a
collection
of
natural
curiosities
the
boy
knew
better
but
concealed
his
knowledge
he
longed
for
a
repetition
of
the
solemnity
but
unfortunately
just
as
the
most
opportune
sun
arose
the
porcelain
cup
was
not
at
hand
he
placed
the
pastils
immediately
on
the
upper
surface
of
the
stand
they
were
kindled
and
so
great
was
the
devotion
of
the
priest
that
he
did
not
observe
until
it
was
too
late
the
mischief
his
sacrifice
was
doing
the
pastils
had
burned
mercilessly
into
the
red
lacker
and
beautiful
gold
flowers
and
as
if
some
evil
spirit
had
disappeared
had
left
their
black
ineffaceable
footprints
by
this
the
young
priest
was
thrown
into
the
most
extreme
perplexity
the
mischief
could
be
covered
up
it
was
true
with
the
larger
pieces
of
his
but
the
spirit
for
new
offerings
was
gone
and
the
accident
might
almost
be
considered
a
hint
and
warning
of
the
danger
there
always
is
in
wishing
to
approach
the
deity
in
such
a
way
a
chief
judge
or
magistrate
of
the
town
an
old
silver
coin
second
book
all
that
has
been
hitherto
recorded
indicates
that
happy
and
easy
condition
in
which
nations
exist
during
a
long
peace
but
nowhere
probably
is
such
a
beautiful
time
enjoyed
in
greater
comfort
than
in
cities
living
under
their
own
laws
and
large
enough
to
include
a
considerable
number
of
citizens
and
so
situated
as
to
enrich
them
by
trade
and
commerce
strangers
find
it
to
their
advantage
to
come
and
go
and
are
under
a
necessity
of
bringing
profit
in
order
to
acquire
profit
even
if
such
cities
rule
but
a
small
territory
they
are
the
better
qualified
to
advance
their
internal
prosperity
as
their
external
relations
expose
them
to
no
costly
undertakings
or
alliances
thus
the
frankforters
passed
a
series
of
prosperous
years
during
my
childhood
but
scarcely
on
the
of
august
had
i
completed
my
seventh
year
than
that
war
broke
out
which
was
also
to
exert
great
influence
upon
the
next
seven
years
of
my
life
frederick
the
second
king
of
prussia
had
fallen
upon
saxony
with
sixty
thousand
men
and
instead
of
announcing
his
invasion
by
a
declaration
of
war
he
followed
it
up
with
a
manifesto
composed
by
himself
as
it
was
said
which
explained
the
causes
that
had
moved
and
justified
him
in
so
monstrous
a
step
the
world
which
saw
itself
appealed
to
not
merely
as
spectator
but
as
judge
immediately
split
into
two
parties
and
our
family
was
an
image
of
the
great
whole
my
grandfather
who
as
of
frankfort
had
carried
the
coronation
canopy
over
francis
the
first
and
had
received
from
the
empress
a
heavy
gold
chain
with
her
likeness
took
the
austrian
side
along
with
some
of
his
and
daughters
my
father
having
been
nominated
to
the
imperial
council
by
charles
the
seventh
and
sympathising
sincerely
in
the
fate
of
that
unhappy
monarch
leaned
towards
prussia
with
the
other
and
smaller
half
of
the
family
our
meetings
which
had
been
held
on
sundays
for
many
years
uninterruptedly
were
very
soon
disturbed
the
misunderstandings
so
common
among
relatives
by
marriage
now
first
found
a
form
in
which
they
could
be
expressed
contention
discord
silence
and
separation
ensued
my
grandfather
otherwise
a
serene
quiet
and
easy
man
became
impatient
the
women
vainly
endeavoured
to
smother
the
flames
and
after
some
unpleasant
scenes
my
father
was
the
first
to
quit
the
society
at
home
now
we
rejoiced
undisturbed
in
the
prussian
victories
which
were
commonly
announced
with
great
glee
by
our
vivacious
aunt
every
other
interest
was
forced
to
give
way
to
this
and
we
passed
the
rest
of
the
year
in
perpetual
agitation
the
occupation
of
dresden
the
moderation
of
the
king
at
the
outset
his
slow
but
secure
advances
the
victory
at
lowositz
the
capture
of
the
saxons
were
so
many
triumphs
for
our
party
everything
that
could
be
alleged
for
the
advantage
of
our
opponents
was
denied
or
depreciated
and
as
the
members
of
the
family
on
the
other
side
did
the
same
they
could
not
meet
in
the
streets
without
disputes
arising
as
in
and
family
disputes
thus
i
also
was
then
a
prussian
in
my
views
or
to
speak
more
correctly
a
fritzian
since
what
cared
we
for
prussia
it
was
the
personal
character
of
the
great
king
that
worked
upon
all
hearts
i
rejoiced
with
my
father
in
our
conquests
readily
copied
the
songs
of
triumph
and
almost
more
willingly
the
lampoons
directed
against
the
other
party
poor
as
the
rhymes
might
be
as
the
eldest
grandson
and
godchild
i
had
dined
every
sunday
since
my
infancy
with
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
and
the
hours
so
spent
had
been
the
most
delightful
of
the
whole
week
but
now
i
relished
no
morsel
that
i
tasted
because
i
was
compelled
to
hear
the
most
horrible
slanders
of
my
hero
here
blew
another
wind
here
sounded
another
tone
than
at
home
my
liking
and
even
my
respect
for
my
grandfather
and
grandmother
fell
off
i
could
mention
nothing
of
this
to
my
parents
but
avoided
the
matter
both
on
account
of
my
own
feelings
and
because
i
had
been
warned
by
my
mother
in
this
way
i
was
thrown
back
upon
myself
and
as
in
my
sixth
year
after
the
earthquake
at
lisbon
the
goodness
of
god
had
become
to
me
in
some
measure
suspicious
so
i
began
now
on
account
of
frederick
the
second
to
doubt
the
justice
of
the
public
my
heart
was
naturally
inclined
to
reverence
and
it
required
a
great
shock
to
stagger
my
faith
in
anything
that
was
venerable
but
alas
they
had
commended
good
manners
and
a
becoming
deportment
to
us
not
for
their
own
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
the
people
what
will
people
say
was
always
the
cry
and
i
thought
that
the
people
must
be
right
good
people
and
would
know
how
to
judge
of
anything
and
everything
but
my
experience
went
just
to
the
contrary
the
greatest
and
most
signal
services
were
defamed
and
attacked
the
noblest
deeds
if
not
denied
were
at
least
misrepresented
and
diminished
and
this
base
injustice
was
done
to
the
only
man
who
was
manifestly
elevated
above
all
his
contemporaries
and
who
daily
proved
what
he
was
able
to
do
and
that
not
by
the
populace
but
by
distinguished
men
as
i
took
my
grandfather
and
uncles
to
be
that
parties
existed
and
that
he
himself
belonged
to
a
party
had
never
entered
into
the
conceptions
of
the
boy
he
therefore
believed
himself
all
the
more
right
and
dared
hold
his
own
opinion
for
the
better
one
since
he
and
those
of
like
mind
appreciated
the
beauty
and
other
good
qualities
of
maria
theresa
and
even
did
not
grudge
the
emperor
francis
his
love
of
jewelry
and
money
that
count
daun
was
often
called
an
old
dozer
they
thought
justifiable
but
now
i
consider
the
matter
more
closely
i
trace
here
the
germ
of
that
disregard
and
even
disdain
of
the
public
which
clung
to
me
for
a
whole
period
of
my
life
and
only
in
later
days
was
brought
within
bounds
by
insight
and
cultivation
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
perception
of
the
injustice
of
parties
had
even
then
a
very
unpleasant
nay
an
injurious
effect
upon
the
boy
as
it
accustomed
him
to
separate
himself
from
beloved
and
persons
the
quick
succession
of
battles
and
events
left
the
parties
neither
quiet
nor
rest
we
ever
found
a
malicious
delight
in
reviving
and
those
imaginary
evils
and
capricious
disputes
and
thus
we
continued
to
tease
each
other
until
the
occupation
of
frankfort
by
the
french
some
years
afterwards
brought
real
inconvenience
into
our
homes
amusements
although
to
most
of
us
the
important
events
occurring
in
distant
parts
served
only
for
topics
of
ardent
controversy
there
were
others
who
perceived
the
seriousness
of
the
times
and
feared
that
the
sympathy
of
france
might
open
a
scene
of
war
in
our
own
vicinity
they
kept
us
children
at
home
more
than
before
and
strove
in
many
ways
to
occupy
and
amuse
us
with
this
view
the
bequeathed
by
our
grandmother
was
again
brought
forth
and
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
the
spectators
sat
in
my
gable
room
while
the
persons
managing
and
performing
as
well
as
the
theatre
itself
as
far
as
the
proscenium
found
a
place
in
the
room
adjoining
we
were
allowed
as
a
special
favour
to
invite
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
children
as
spectators
and
thus
at
the
outset
i
gained
many
friends
but
the
restlessness
inherent
in
children
did
not
suffer
them
to
remain
long
a
patient
audience
they
interrupted
the
play
and
we
were
compelled
to
seek
a
younger
public
which
could
at
any
rate
be
kept
in
order
by
the
nurses
and
maids
the
original
drama
to
which
the
puppets
had
been
specially
adapted
we
had
learnt
by
heart
and
in
the
beginning
this
was
exclusively
performed
soon
growing
weary
of
it
however
we
changed
the
dresses
and
decorations
and
attempted
various
other
pieces
which
were
indeed
on
too
grand
a
scale
for
so
narrow
a
stage
although
this
presumption
spoiled
and
finally
quite
destroyed
what
we
performed
such
childish
pleasures
and
employments
nevertheless
exercised
and
advanced
in
many
ways
my
power
of
invention
and
representation
my
fancy
and
a
certain
technical
skill
to
a
degree
which
in
any
other
way
could
not
perhaps
have
been
secured
in
so
short
a
time
in
so
confined
a
space
and
at
so
little
expense
i
had
early
learned
to
use
compasses
and
ruler
because
all
the
instructions
they
gave
me
in
geometry
were
forthwith
put
into
practice
and
i
occupied
myself
greatly
with
i
did
not
stop
at
geometrical
figures
little
boxes
and
such
things
but
invented
pretty
adorned
with
pilasters
steps
and
flat
roofs
however
but
little
of
this
was
completed
far
more
persevering
was
i
on
the
other
hand
in
arranging
with
the
help
of
our
domestic
a
tailor
by
trade
an
armoury
for
the
service
of
our
plays
and
tragedies
which
we
ourselves
performed
with
delight
when
we
had
outgrown
the
puppets
my
playfellows
too
prepared
for
themselves
such
armouries
which
they
regarded
as
quite
as
fine
and
good
as
mine
but
i
had
made
provision
not
for
the
wants
of
one
person
only
and
could
furnish
several
of
the
little
band
with
every
requisite
and
thus
made
myself
more
and
more
indispensable
to
our
little
circle
that
such
games
tended
to
factions
quarrels
and
blows
and
commonly
came
to
a
sad
end
in
tumult
and
vexation
may
easily
be
supposed
in
such
cases
certain
of
my
companions
generally
took
part
with
me
while
others
sided
against
me
though
many
changes
of
party
occurred
one
single
boy
whom
i
pylades
urged
by
the
others
once
only
left
my
party
but
could
scarcely
for
a
moment
maintain
his
hostile
position
we
were
reconciled
amid
many
tears
and
for
a
long
time
afterwards
kept
faithfully
together
to
him
as
well
as
other
i
could
render
myself
very
agreeable
by
telling
tales
which
they
most
delighted
to
near
when
i
was
the
hero
of
my
own
story
it
greatly
rejoiced
them
to
know
that
such
wonderful
things
could
befall
one
of
their
own
playfellows
nor
was
it
any
harm
that
they
did
not
understand
how
i
could
find
time
and
space
for
such
adventures
as
they
must
have
been
pretty
well
aware
of
all
my
comings
and
goings
and
how
i
was
occupied
the
entire
day
not
the
less
necessary
was
it
for
me
to
select
the
localities
of
these
occurrences
if
not
in
another
world
at
least
in
another
spot
and
yet
all
was
told
as
having
taken
place
only
or
yesterday
they
rather
therefore
deceived
themselves
than
were
imposed
upon
by
me
if
i
had
not
gradually
learned
in
accordance
with
the
instincts
of
my
nature
to
work
up
these
visions
and
conceits
into
artistic
forms
such
beginnings
could
not
have
gone
on
without
producing
evil
consequences
for
myself
in
the
end
considering
this
impulse
more
closely
we
may
see
in
it
that
presumption
with
which
the
poet
authoritatively
utters
the
greatest
improbabilities
and
requires
every
one
to
recognise
as
real
whatever
may
in
any
way
seem
to
him
the
inventor
as
true
but
what
is
here
told
only
in
general
terms
and
by
way
of
reflection
will
perhaps
become
more
apparent
and
interesting
by
means
of
an
example
i
subjoin
therefore
one
of
these
tales
which
as
i
often
had
to
repeat
it
to
my
comrades
still
hovers
entire
in
my
imagination
and
memory
the
new
paris
a
boy
legend
on
the
night
before
whit
sunday
not
long
since
i
dreamed
that
i
stood
before
a
mirror
engaged
with
the
new
summer
clothes
which
my
dear
parents
had
given
me
for
the
holiday
the
dress
consisted
as
you
know
of
shoes
of
polished
leather
with
large
silver
buckles
fine
cotton
stockings
black
nether
garments
of
serge
and
a
coat
of
green
baracan
with
gold
buttons
the
waistcoat
of
gold
cloth
was
cut
out
of
my
father
bridal
waistcoat
my
hair
had
been
frizzled
and
powdered
and
my
curls
stuck
out
from
my
head
like
little
wings
but
i
could
not
finish
dressing
myself
because
i
kept
confusing
the
different
articles
the
first
always
falling
off
as
soon
as
i
was
about
to
put
on
the
next
in
this
dilemma
a
young
and
handsome
man
came
to
me
and
greeted
me
in
the
friendliest
manner
o
you
are
welcome
said
i
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
here
do
you
know
me
then
replied
he
smiling
why
not
was
my
no
less
smiling
answer
you
are
mercury
i
have
often
enough
seen
you
represented
in
pictures
i
am
indeed
replied
he
and
am
sent
to
you
by
the
gods
on
an
important
errand
do
you
see
these
three
apples
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
showed
me
three
apples
which
it
could
hardly
hold
and
which
were
as
wonderfully
beautiful
as
they
were
large
the
one
of
a
red
the
other
of
a
yellow
the
third
of
a
green
colour
one
could
not
help
thinking
they
were
precious
stones
made
into
the
form
of
fruit
i
would
have
snatched
them
but
he
drew
back
and
said
you
must
know
in
the
first
place
that
they
are
not
for
you
you
must
give
them
to
the
three
handsomest
youths
of
the
city
who
then
each
according
to
his
lot
will
find
wives
to
the
utmost
of
their
wishes
take
them
and
success
to
you
said
he
as
he
departed
leaving
the
apples
in
my
open
hands
they
appeared
to
me
to
have
become
still
larger
i
held
them
up
at
once
against
the
light
and
found
them
quite
transparent
but
soon
they
expanded
upwards
and
became
three
beautiful
little
ladies
about
as
large
as
dolls
whose
clothes
were
of
the
colours
of
the
apples
they
glided
gently
up
my
fingers
and
when
i
was
about
to
catch
at
them
to
make
sure
of
one
at
least
they
had
already
soared
high
and
far
and
i
had
to
put
up
with
the
disappointment
i
stood
there
alt
amazed
and
petrified
holding
up
my
hands
and
staring
at
my
fingers
as
if
there
were
still
something
on
them
to
see
suddenly
i
beheld
upon
the
very
tips
a
most
lovely
girl
dancing
smaller
than
those
but
pretty
and
lively
and
as
she
did
not
fly
away
like
the
others
but
remained
dancing
now
on
one
now
on
another
i
regarded
her
for
a
long
while
with
admiration
and
as
she
pleased
me
so
much
i
thought
in
the
end
i
could
catch
her
and
made
as
i
fancied
a
very
adroit
grasp
but
at
the
moment
i
felt
such
a
blow
on
my
head
that
i
fell
down
stunned
and
did
not
awake
from
my
stupor
till
it
was
time
to
dress
myself
and
go
to
church
during
the
service
i
often
recalled
those
images
to
mind
and
also
when
i
was
eating
dinner
at
my
table
in
the
afternoon
i
wished
to
visit
some
friends
partly
to
show
myself
in
my
now
dress
with
my
hat
under
my
arm
and
my
sword
by
my
side
and
partly
to
return
their
visits
i
found
no
one
at
home
and
as
i
heard
that
they
were
gone
to
the
gardens
i
resolved
to
follow
them
and
pass
the
evening
pleasantly
my
way
led
towards
the
entrenchments
and
i
came
to
the
spot
which
is
rightly
called
the
bad
wall
for
it
is
never
quite
safe
from
ghosts
there
i
walked
slowly
and
thought
of
my
three
goddesses
but
especially
of
the
little
nymph
and
often
held
up
my
fingers
in
hopes
she
might
be
kind
enough
to
balance
herself
there
again
with
such
thoughts
i
was
proceeding
when
i
saw
in
the
wall
on
my
left
hand
a
little
gate
which
i
did
not
remember
to
have
ever
noticed
before
it
looked
low
but
its
pointed
arch
would
have
allowed
the
tallest
man
to
enter
arch
and
wall
were
chiselled
out
in
the
handsomest
way
both
by
mason
and
sculptor
but
it
was
the
door
itself
which
first
properly
attracted
my
attention
the
old
brown
wood
though
slightly
ornamented
was
crossed
with
broad
bands
of
brass
wrought
both
in
relief
and
intaglio
the
foliage
on
these
with
the
most
natural
birds
sitting
in
it
i
could
not
sufficiently
admire
but
what
seemed
most
remarkable
no
keyhole
could
be
seen
no
latch
no
knocker
and
from
this
i
conjectured
that
the
door
could
be
opened
only
from
within
i
was
not
in
error
for
when
i
went
nearer
in
order
to
touch
the
ornaments
it
opened
inwards
and
there
appeared
a
man
whose
dress
was
somewhat
long
wide
and
singular
a
venerable
beard
enveloped
his
chin
so
that
i
was
inclined
to
think
him
a
jew
but
he
as
if
he
had
divined
my
thoughts
made
the
sign
of
the
holy
cross
by
which
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
was
a
good
catholic
christian
young
gentleman
how
came
you
here
and
what
are
you
doing
he
said
to
me
with
a
friendly
voice
and
manner
i
am
admiring
i
replied
the
workmanship
of
this
door
for
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
it
except
in
some
small
pieces
in
the
collections
of
amateurs
i
am
glad
he
answered
that
you
like
such
works
the
door
is
much
more
beautiful
inside
come
in
if
you
like
my
heart
in
some
degree
failed
me
the
mysterious
dress
of
the
porter
the
seclusion
and
a
something
i
know
not
what
that
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
oppressed
me
i
paused
therefore
under
the
pretext
of
examining
the
outside
still
longer
and
at
the
same
time
i
cast
stolen
glances
into
the
garden
for
a
garden
it
was
which
had
opened
before
me
just
inside
the
door
i
saw
a
space
old
linden
trees
standing
at
regular
distances
from
each
other
entirely
covered
it
with
their
thickly
interwoven
branches
so
that
the
most
numerous
parties
during
the
hottest
of
the
day
might
have
refreshed
themselves
in
the
shade
already
i
had
stepped
upon
the
threshold
and
the
old
man
contrived
gradually
to
allure
me
on
properly
speaking
i
did
not
resist
for
i
had
always
heard
that
a
prince
or
sultan
in
such
a
case
must
never
ask
whether
there
be
danger
at
hand
i
had
my
sword
by
my
side
too
and
could
i
not
soon
have
finished
with
the
old
man
in
case
of
hostile
demonstrations
i
therefore
entered
perfectly
reassured
the
keeper
closed
the
door
which
bolted
so
softly
that
i
scarcely
heard
it
he
now
showed
me
the
workmanship
on
the
inside
which
in
truth
was
still
more
artistic
than
the
outside
explained
it
to
me
and
at
the
same
time
manifested
particular
being
thus
entirely
at
my
ease
i
let
myself
be
guided
in
the
shaded
space
by
the
wall
that
formed
a
circle
where
i
found
much
to
admire
niches
tastefully
adorned
with
shells
corals
and
pieces
of
ore
poured
a
profusion
of
water
from
the
mouths
of
tritons
into
marble
basins
between
them
were
aviaries
and
other
in
which
squirrels
frisked
about
ran
hither
and
thither
with
as
many
other
pretty
little
creatures
as
one
could
wish
to
see
the
birds
called
and
sang
to
us
as
we
advanced
the
starlings
particularly
chattered
the
silliest
stuff
one
always
cried
paris
paris
and
the
other
narcissus
narcissus
as
plainly
as
a
schoolboy
can
say
them
the
old
man
seemed
to
continue
looking
at
me
earnestly
while
the
birds
called
out
thus
but
i
feigned
not
to
notice
it
and
had
in
truth
no
time
to
attend
to
him
for
i
could
easily
perceive
that
we
went
round
and
round
and
that
this
shaded
space
was
in
fact
a
great
circle
which
inclosed
another
much
more
important
indeed
we
had
actually
reached
the
small
door
again
and
it
seemed
as
though
the
old
man
would
let
me
out
but
my
eyes
remained
directed
towards
a
golden
railing
which
seemed
to
hedge
round
the
middle
of
this
wonderful
garden
and
which
i
had
found
means
enough
of
observing
in
our
walk
although
the
old
man
managed
to
keep
me
always
close
to
the
wall
and
therefore
pretty
far
from
the
centre
and
now
just
as
he
was
going
to
the
door
i
said
to
him
with
a
bow
you
have
been
so
extremely
kind
to
me
that
i
would
fain
venture
to
make
one
more
request
before
i
part
from
you
might
i
not
look
more
closely
at
that
golden
railing
which
appears
to
inclose
in
a
very
wide
circle
the
interior
of
the
garden
very
willingly
replied
he
but
in
that
case
you
must
submit
to
some
conditions
in
what
do
they
consist
i
asked
hastily
you
must
leave
here
your
hat
and
sword
and
must
not
let
go
my
hand
while
i
accompany
you
most
willingly
i
replied
and
laid
my
hat
and
sword
on
the
nearest
stone
bench
immediately
he
grasped
my
left
hand
with
his
right
held
it
fast
and
led
me
with
some
force
straight
forwards
when
we
reached
the
railing
my
wonder
changed
into
amazement
on
a
high
socle
of
marble
stood
innumerable
spears
and
partisans
ranged
beneath
each
other
joined
by
their
strangely
ornamented
points
and
forming
a
complete
circle
i
looked
through
the
intervals
and
saw
just
behind
a
gently
flowing
piece
of
water
bounded
on
both
sides
by
marble
and
displaying
in
its
clear
depths
a
multitude
of
gold
and
silver
fish
which
moved
about
now
slowly
and
now
swiftly
now
alone
and
now
in
shoals
i
would
also
fain
have
looked
beyond
the
canal
to
see
what
there
was
in
the
heart
of
the
garden
but
i
found
to
my
great
sorrow
that
the
other
side
of
the
water
was
bordered
by
a
similar
railing
and
with
so
much
art
that
to
each
interval
on
this
side
exactly
fitted
a
spear
or
partisan
on
the
other
these
and
the
other
ornaments
rendered
it
impossible
for
one
to
see
through
stand
as
one
would
besides
the
old
man
who
still
held
me
fast
prevented
me
from
moving
freely
my
curiosity
meanwhile
after
all
that
i
had
seen
increased
more
and
more
and
i
took
heart
to
ask
the
old
man
whether
one
could
not
pass
over
why
not
returned
he
but
on
new
conditions
when
i
asked
him
what
these
were
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
i
must
put
on
other
clothes
i
was
satisfied
to
do
so
he
led
me
back
towards
the
wall
into
a
small
neat
room
on
the
sides
of
which
hung
many
kinds
of
garments
all
of
which
seemed
to
approach
the
oriental
costume
i
soon
changed
my
dress
he
confined
my
powdered
hair
under
a
many
coloured
net
after
having
to
my
horror
violently
dusted
it
out
now
standing
before
a
great
mirror
i
found
myself
quite
handsome
in
my
disguise
and
pleased
myself
better
than
in
my
formal
sunday
clothes
i
made
gestures
and
leaped
as
i
had
seen
the
dancers
do
at
the
in
the
midst
of
this
i
looked
in
the
glass
and
saw
by
chance
the
image
of
a
niche
which
was
behind
me
on
its
white
ground
hung
three
green
cords
each
of
them
twisted
up
in
a
way
which
from
the
distance
i
could
not
clearly
discern
i
therefore
turned
round
rather
hastily
and
asked
the
old
man
about
the
niche
as
well
as
the
cords
he
very
courteously
took
a
cord
down
and
showed
it
to
me
it
was
a
band
of
green
silk
of
moderate
thickness
the
ends
of
which
joined
by
green
leather
with
two
holes
in
it
gave
it
the
appearance
of
an
instrument
for
no
very
desirable
purpose
the
thing
struck
me
as
suspicious
and
i
asked
the
old
man
the
meaning
he
answered
me
very
quietly
and
kindly
this
is
for
those
who
abuse
the
confidence
which
is
here
readily
shown
them
he
hung
the
cord
again
in
its
place
and
immediately
desired
me
to
follow
him
for
this
time
he
did
not
hold
me
and
so
i
walked
freely
beside
him
my
chief
curiosity
now
was
to
discover
where
the
gate
and
bridge
for
passing
through
the
railing
and
over
the
canal
might
be
since
as
yet
i
had
not
been
able
to
find
anything
of
the
kind
i
therefore
watched
the
golden
fence
very
narrowly
as
we
hastened
towards
it
but
in
a
moment
my
sight
failed
lances
spears
halberds
and
partisans
began
unexpectedly
to
rattle
and
quiver
and
this
strange
movement
ended
in
all
the
points
sinking
towards
each
other
just
as
if
two
ancient
hosts
armed
with
pikes
were
about
to
charge
the
confusion
to
the
eyes
the
clatter
to
the
ears
was
hardly
to
be
borne
but
infinitely
surprising
was
the
sight
when
falling
perfectly
level
they
covered
the
circle
of
the
canal
and
formed
the
most
glorious
bridge
that
one
can
imagine
for
now
a
most
variegated
garden
parterre
met
my
sight
it
was
laid
out
in
curvilinear
beds
which
looked
at
together
formed
a
labyrinth
of
ornaments
all
with
green
borders
of
a
low
woolly
plant
which
i
had
never
seen
before
all
with
flowers
each
division
of
different
colours
which
being
likewise
low
and
close
to
the
ground
allowed
the
plan
to
be
easily
traced
this
delicious
sight
which
i
enjoyed
in
the
full
sunshine
quite
rivetted
my
eyes
but
i
hardly
knew
where
i
was
to
set
my
foot
for
the
serpentine
paths
were
most
delicately
laid
with
blue
sand
which
seemed
to
form
upon
the
earth
a
darker
sky
or
a
sky
seen
in
the
water
and
so
i
walked
for
a
while
beside
my
conductor
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
until
at
last
i
perceived
that
in
the
middle
of
this
round
of
beds
and
flowers
there
was
a
great
circle
of
cypresses
or
trees
through
which
one
could
not
see
because
the
lowest
branches
seemed
to
spring
out
of
the
ground
my
guide
without
taking
me
directly
the
shortest
way
led
me
nevertheless
immediately
towards
that
centre
and
how
was
i
astonished
when
on
entering
the
circle
of
high
trees
i
saw
before
me
the
peristyle
of
a
magnificent
which
seemed
to
have
similar
prospects
and
entrances
on
the
other
sides
the
heavenly
music
which
streamed
from
the
building
transported
me
still
more
than
this
model
of
architecture
i
fancied
that
i
heard
now
a
lute
now
a
harp
now
a
guitar
and
now
something
tinkling
which
did
not
belong
to
any
of
these
instruments
the
door
which
we
approached
opened
soon
after
a
light
touch
by
the
old
man
but
how
was
i
amazed
when
the
porteress
who
came
out
perfectly
resembled
the
delicate
girl
who
had
danced
upon
my
fingers
in
the
dream
she
greeted
me
as
if
we
were
already
acquainted
and
invited
me
to
walk
in
the
old
man
remained
behind
and
i
went
with
her
through
a
short
passage
arched
and
finely
ornamented
to
the
middle
hall
the
splendid
ceiling
of
which
attracted
my
gaze
on
my
entrance
and
filled
me
with
astonishment
yet
my
eye
could
not
linger
long
on
this
being
allured
down
by
a
more
charming
spectacle
on
a
carpet
directly
under
the
middle
of
the
cupola
sat
three
women
in
a
triangle
clad
in
three
different
colours
one
red
the
other
yellow
the
third
green
the
seats
were
gilt
and
the
carpet
was
a
perfect
in
their
arras
lay
the
three
instruments
which
i
had
been
able
to
distinguish
from
the
outside
for
being
disturbed
by
my
arrival
they
had
stopped
their
playing
welcome
said
the
middle
one
who
sat
with
her
face
to
the
door
in
a
red
dress
and
with
the
harp
sit
down
by
alert
and
listen
if
you
are
a
lover
of
music
now
first
i
remarked
that
there
was
a
rather
long
bench
placed
obliquely
before
them
on
which
lay
a
mandoline
the
pretty
girl
took
it
up
sat
down
and
drew
me
to
her
side
now
also
i
looked
at
the
second
lady
on
my
right
she
wore
the
yellow
dress
and
had
the
guitar
in
her
hand
and
if
the
was
dignified
in
form
grand
in
features
and
majestic
in
her
deportment
one
might
remark
in
the
an
easy
grace
and
cheerfulness
she
was
a
slender
blonde
while
the
other
was
adorned
by
dark
brown
hair
the
variety
and
accordance
of
their
music
could
not
prevent
me
from
remarking
the
third
beauty
in
the
green
dress
whose
was
for
me
at
once
touching
and
striking
she
was
the
one
who
seemed
to
notice
me
the
most
and
to
direct
her
music
to
me
only
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
about
her
for
she
appeared
to
me
now
tender
now
whimsical
now
frank
now
according
as
she
changed
her
mien
and
mode
of
playing
sometimes
she
seemed
to
wish
to
move
me
sometimes
to
teaze
me
but
do
what
she
would
she
got
little
out
of
me
for
my
little
neighbour
by
whom
i
sat
elbow
to
elbow
had
gained
me
entirely
to
herself
and
while
i
clearly
saw
in
those
three
ladies
the
sylphides
of
my
dream
and
recognised
the
colours
of
the
apples
i
conceived
that
i
had
no
cause
to
detain
them
the
pretty
little
maiden
i
would
rather
have
captured
if
i
had
not
but
too
feelingly
remembered
the
blow
which
she
had
given
me
in
my
dream
hitherto
she
had
remained
quite
quiet
with
her
mandoline
but
when
her
mistresses
had
ceased
they
commanded
her
to
perform
some
pleasant
little
piece
scarcely
had
she
jingled
off
some
dancing
tune
in
a
most
exciting
manner
than
she
sprang
up
i
did
the
same
she
played
and
danced
i
was
hurried
on
to
accompany
her
steps
and
we
executed
a
kind
of
little
ballet
with
which
the
ladies
seemed
satisfied
for
as
soon
as
we
had
done
they
commanded
the
little
girl
to
refresh
me
with
something
nice
till
supper
should
come
in
i
had
indeed
forgotten
that
there
was
anything
in
the
world
beyond
this
paradise
alert
led
me
back
immediately
into
the
passage
by
which
i
had
entered
on
one
side
of
it
she
had
two
rooms
in
that
in
which
she
lived
she
set
before
me
oranges
figs
peaches
and
grapes
and
i
enjoyed
with
great
gusto
both
the
fruits
of
foreign
lands
and
those
of
our
own
not
yet
in
season
confectionary
there
was
in
profusion
she
filled
too
a
goblet
of
polished
crystal
with
foaming
wine
but
i
had
no
need
to
drink
as
i
had
refreshed
myself
with
the
fruits
now
we
will
play
said
she
and
led
me
into
the
other
room
here
all
looked
like
a
christmas
fair
but
such
costly
and
exquisite
things
were
never
seen
in
a
christmas
booth
there
were
all
kinds
of
dolls
dolls
clothes
and
dolls
furniture
kitchens
parlours
and
shops
and
single
toys
innumerable
she
led
me
round
to
all
the
glass
cases
in
which
these
ingenious
works
were
preserved
but
she
soon
closed
again
the
first
cases
and
said
that
is
nothing
for
you
i
know
well
enough
here
she
said
we
could
find
building
materials
walls
and
towers
houses
palaces
churches
to
put
together
a
great
city
but
this
does
not
entertain
me
we
will
take
something
else
which
will
be
pleasant
alike
to
both
of
us
then
she
brought
out
some
boxes
in
which
i
saw
an
army
of
little
soldiers
piled
one
upon
the
other
of
which
i
must
needs
confess
that
i
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
she
did
not
leave
me
time
to
examine
them
closely
in
detail
but
took
one
box
under
her
arm
while
i
seized
the
we
will
go
she
said
upon
the
golden
bridge
there
one
plays
best
with
soldiers
the
lances
give
at
once
the
direction
in
which
the
armies
are
to
be
opposed
to
each
other
we
had
now
reached
the
golden
trembling
floor
and
below
me
i
could
hear
the
waters
gurgle
and
the
fishes
splash
while
i
knelt
down
to
range
my
columns
all
as
i
now
saw
were
cavalry
she
boasted
that
she
had
the
queen
of
the
amazons
as
leader
of
her
female
host
i
on
the
contrary
found
achilles
and
a
very
stately
grecian
cavalry
the
armies
stood
facing
each
other
and
nothing
could
have
been
seen
more
beautiful
they
were
not
flat
leaden
horsemen
like
ours
but
man
and
horse
were
round
and
solid
and
most
finely
wrought
nor
could
one
conceive
how
they
kept
their
balance
for
they
stood
of
themselves
without
a
support
for
their
feet
both
of
us
had
inspected
our
hosts
with
much
when
she
announced
the
onset
we
had
found
ordnance
in
our
chests
little
boxes
full
of
agate
balls
with
these
we
were
to
fight
against
each
other
from
a
certain
distance
while
however
it
was
an
express
condition
that
we
should
not
throw
with
more
force
than
was
necessary
to
upset
the
figures
as
none
of
them
were
to
be
injured
now
the
cannonade
began
on
both
sides
and
at
first
it
succeeded
to
the
satisfaction
of
us
both
but
when
my
adversary
observed
that
i
aimed
better
than
she
and
might
in
the
end
win
the
victory
which
depended
on
the
majority
of
pieces
remaining
upright
she
came
nearer
and
her
girlish
way
of
throwing
had
then
the
desired
result
she
prostrated
a
multitude
of
my
best
troops
and
the
more
i
protested
the
more
eagerly
did
she
throw
this
at
last
vexed
me
and
i
declared
that
i
would
do
the
same
in
fact
i
not
only
went
nearer
but
in
my
rage
threw
with
much
more
violence
so
that
it
was
not
long
before
a
pair
of
her
little
centauresses
flew
in
pieces
in
her
eagerness
she
did
not
instantly
notice
it
but
i
stood
petrified
when
the
broken
figures
joined
together
again
of
themselves
amazon
and
horse
became
again
one
whole
and
also
perfectly
close
set
up
a
gallop
from
the
golden
bridge
under
the
and
running
swiftly
backwards
and
forwards
were
lost
in
their
career
i
know
not
how
in
the
direction
of
the
wall
my
fair
opponent
had
hardly
perceived
this
when
she
broke
out
into
loud
weeping
and
lamentation
and
exclaimed
that
i
had
caused
her
an
irreparable
loss
which
was
far
greater
than
could
be
expressed
but
i
by
this
time
provoked
was
glad
to
annoy
her
and
blindly
flung
a
couple
of
the
remaining
agate
balls
with
force
into
the
midst
of
her
army
unhappily
i
hit
the
queen
who
had
hitherto
during
our
regular
game
been
excepted
she
flew
in
pieces
and
her
nearest
officers
were
also
shivered
but
they
swiftly
set
themselves
up
again
and
started
off
like
the
others
galloping
very
merrily
about
under
the
and
disappearing
against
the
wall
my
opponent
scolded
and
abused
me
but
being
now
in
full
play
i
stooped
to
pick
up
some
agate
balls
which
rolled
about
upon
the
golden
lances
it
was
my
fierce
desire
to
destroy
her
whole
army
she
on
the
other
hand
not
idle
sprang
at
me
and
gave
me
a
box
on
the
ear
which
made
my
head
ring
again
having
always
heard
that
a
hearty
kiss
was
the
proper
response
to
a
box
of
the
ear
i
took
her
by
the
ears
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
but
she
gave
such
a
piercing
cry
as
frightened
even
me
i
let
her
go
and
it
was
fortunate
that
i
did
so
for
in
a
moment
i
knew
not
what
was
happening
to
me
the
ground
beneath
me
began
to
quake
and
rattle
i
soon
remarked
that
the
railings
again
set
themselves
in
motion
but
i
had
no
time
to
consider
nor
could
i
get
a
footing
so
as
to
fly
i
feared
every
instant
to
be
pierced
for
the
partisans
and
lances
which
had
lifted
themselves
up
were
already
slitting
my
clothes
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
i
know
not
how
it
was
hearing
and
sight
failed
me
and
i
recovered
from
my
swoon
and
terror
at
the
foot
of
a
against
which
the
pikes
in
springing
up
had
thrown
me
as
i
awoke
my
anger
awakened
also
and
violently
increased
when
i
heard
from
the
other
side
the
gibes
and
laughter
of
my
opponent
who
had
probably
reached
the
earth
somewhat
more
softly
than
thereupon
i
sprang
up
and
as
i
saw
the
little
host
with
its
leader
achilles
scattered
around
me
having
been
driven
over
with
me
by
the
rising
of
the
rails
i
seized
the
hero
first
and
threw
him
against
a
tree
his
resuscitation
and
flight
now
pleased
me
doubly
a
malicious
pleasure
combining
with
the
prettiest
sight
in
the
world
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
sending
all
the
other
greeks
after
him
when
suddenly
hissing
waters
spurted
at
me
on
all
sides
from
stones
and
walls
from
ground
and
branches
and
wherever
i
turned
dashed
against
me
crossways
my
light
garment
was
in
a
short
time
wet
through
it
was
already
rent
and
i
did
not
hesitate
to
tear
it
entirely
off
my
body
i
cast
away
my
slippers
and
one
covering
after
another
nay
at
last
i
found
it
very
agreeable
to
let
such
a
play
over
me
in
the
warm
day
now
being
quite
naked
i
walked
gravely
along
between
these
welcome
waters
where
i
thought
to
enjoy
myself
for
some
time
my
anger
cooled
and
i
wished
for
nothing
more
than
a
reconciliation
with
my
little
adversary
but
in
a
twinkling
the
water
stopped
and
i
stood
drenched
upon
the
saturated
ground
the
presence
of
the
old
man
who
appeared
before
me
unexpectedly
was
by
no
means
welcome
i
could
have
wished
if
not
to
hide
at
least
to
clothe
myself
the
shame
the
shivering
the
effort
to
cover
myself
in
some
degree
made
me
cut
a
most
piteous
figure
the
old
man
employed
the
moment
in
venting
the
severest
reproaches
against
me
what
hinders
me
he
exclaimed
from
taking
one
of
the
green
cords
and
fitting
it
if
not
to
your
neck
to
your
back
this
threat
i
took
in
very
ill
part
refrain
i
cried
from
such
words
even
from
such
thoughts
for
otherwise
you
and
your
mistresses
will
be
lost
who
then
are
you
he
asked
in
defiance
who
dare
speak
thus
a
favourite
of
the
gods
i
said
on
whom
it
depends
whether
those
ladies
shall
find
worthy
husbands
and
pass
a
happy
life
or
be
left
to
pine
and
wither
in
their
magic
cell
the
old
man
stepped
some
paces
back
who
has
revealed
that
to
you
he
inquired
with
astonishment
and
concern
three
apples
i
said
three
jewels
and
what
reward
do
you
require
he
exclaimed
before
all
things
the
little
creature
i
replied
who
has
brought
me
into
this
accursed
state
the
old
man
cast
himself
down
before
me
without
shrinking
from
the
wet
and
miry
soil
then
he
arose
without
being
wetted
took
me
kindly
by
the
hand
led
me
into
the
hall
clad
me
again
quickly
and
i
was
soon
once
more
decked
out
and
frizzled
in
my
sunday
fashion
as
before
the
porter
did
not
speak
another
word
but
before
he
let
me
pass
the
entrance
he
stopped
me
and
showed
me
some
objects
on
the
wall
over
the
way
while
at
the
same
time
he
pointed
backwards
to
the
door
i
understood
him
he
wished
to
imprint
the
objects
on
my
mind
that
i
might
the
more
certainly
find
the
door
which
had
unexpectedly
closed
behind
me
i
now
took
good
notice
of
what
was
opposite
to
me
above
a
high
wall
rose
the
boughs
of
extremely
old
and
partly
covered
the
cornice
at
the
top
the
branches
reached
down
to
a
stone
tablet
the
ornamented
border
of
which
i
could
perfectly
recognise
though
i
could
not
read
the
inscription
it
rested
on
the
of
a
niche
in
which
a
fountain
poured
water
from
cup
to
cup
into
a
great
basin
that
formed
as
it
were
a
little
pond
and
disappeared
in
the
earth
fountain
inscription
all
stood
directly
one
above
another
i
would
paint
it
as
i
saw
it
now
it
may
well
be
conceived
how
i
passed
this
evening
and
many
following
days
and
how
often
i
repeated
to
myself
this
story
which
even
i
could
hardly
believe
as
soon
as
it
was
in
any
degree
possible
i
went
again
to
the
bad
wall
at
least
to
refresh
my
remembrance
of
these
signs
and
to
look
at
the
precious
door
but
to
my
great
amazement
i
found
ad
changed
indeed
overtopped
the
wall
but
they
did
not
stand
immediately
in
contact
a
tablet
also
was
inserted
in
the
wall
but
far
to
the
right
of
the
trees
without
ornament
and
with
a
legible
inscription
a
niche
with
a
fountain
was
found
far
to
the
left
but
with
no
resemblance
whatever
to
that
which
i
had
seen
so
that
i
almost
believed
that
the
second
adventure
was
like
the
first
a
dream
for
of
the
door
there
is
not
the
slightest
trace
the
only
thing
that
consoles
me
is
the
observation
that
these
three
objects
seem
always
to
change
their
places
for
in
repeated
visits
to
the
spot
i
think
i
have
noticed
that
the
have
moved
somewhat
nearer
together
and
that
the
tablet
and
the
fountain
seem
likewise
to
approach
each
other
probably
when
all
is
brought
together
again
the
door
too
will
once
more
be
visible
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
take
up
the
thread
of
the
adventure
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
what
further
happens
or
whether
it
will
be
expressly
forbidden
me
i
can
not
say
this
tale
of
the
truth
of
which
my
playfellows
vehemently
strove
to
convince
themselves
received
great
applause
each
of
them
visited
alone
the
place
described
without
confiding
it
to
me
or
the
others
and
discovered
the
the
tablet
and
the
spring
though
always
at
a
distance
from
each
other
as
they
at
last
confessed
to
me
afterwards
because
it
is
not
easy
to
conceal
a
secret
at
that
early
age
but
here
the
contest
first
arose
one
asserted
that
the
objects
did
not
stir
from
the
spot
and
always
maintained
the
same
distance
a
second
averred
that
they
did
move
and
that
too
away
from
each
other
a
third
agreed
with
the
latter
as
to
the
first
point
of
their
moving
though
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
tablet
and
fountain
rather
drew
near
together
while
a
fourth
had
something
still
more
wonderful
to
announce
which
was
that
the
were
in
the
middle
but
that
the
tablet
and
the
fountain
were
on
sides
opposite
to
those
which
i
had
stated
with
respect
to
the
traces
of
the
little
door
they
also
varied
and
thus
they
furnished
me
an
early
instance
of
the
contradictory
news
men
can
hold
and
maintain
in
regard
to
matters
quite
simple
and
easily
cleared
up
as
i
obstinately
refused
the
continuation
of
my
tale
a
repetition
of
the
first
part
was
often
desired
i
was
on
my
guard
however
not
to
change
the
circumstances
much
and
by
the
uniformity
of
the
narrative
i
converted
the
fable
into
truth
in
the
minds
of
my
hearers
yet
i
was
averse
to
falsehood
and
dissimulation
and
altogether
by
no
means
frivolous
rather
on
the
contrary
the
inward
earnestness
with
which
i
had
early
begun
to
consider
myself
and
the
world
was
seen
even
in
my
exterior
and
i
was
frequently
called
to
account
often
in
a
friendly
way
and
often
in
raillery
for
a
certain
dignity
which
i
had
assumed
for
although
good
and
chosen
friends
were
certainly
not
wanting
to
me
we
were
always
a
minority
against
those
who
found
pleasure
in
assailing
us
with
wanton
rudeness
and
who
indeed
often
awoke
us
in
no
gentle
fashion
from
that
legendary
and
dreaming
in
which
we
i
by
inventing
and
my
companions
by
sympathising
were
too
readily
absorbed
thus
we
learned
once
more
that
instead
of
sinking
into
effeminacy
and
fantastic
delights
there
was
reason
rather
for
hardening
ourselves
in
order
either
to
bear
or
to
counteract
inevitable
evils
juvenile
stoicism
among
the
stoical
exercises
which
i
cultivated
as
earnestly
as
it
was
possible
for
a
lad
was
even
the
endurance
of
bodily
pain
our
teachers
often
treated
us
very
unkindly
and
unskilfully
with
blows
and
cuffs
against
which
we
hardened
ourselves
all
the
more
as
obstinacy
was
forbidden
under
the
severest
penalties
a
great
many
of
the
sports
of
youth
moreover
depend
on
a
rivalry
in
such
endurances
as
for
instance
when
they
strike
each
other
alternately
with
two
fingers
or
the
whole
fist
till
the
limbs
are
numbed
or
when
they
bear
the
penalty
of
blows
incurred
in
certain
games
with
more
or
less
firmness
when
in
wrestling
or
scuffling
they
do
not
let
themselves
be
perplexed
by
the
pinches
of
a
opponent
or
finally
when
they
suppress
the
pain
inflicted
for
the
sake
of
teasing
and
even
treat
with
indifference
the
nips
and
ticklings
with
which
young
persons
are
so
active
towards
each
other
thus
we
gain
a
great
advantage
of
which
others
can
not
speedily
deprive
us
but
as
i
made
a
sort
of
boast
of
this
impassiveness
the
importunity
of
the
others
was
increased
and
since
rude
barbarity
knows
no
limits
it
managed
to
force
me
beyond
my
bounds
let
one
case
suffice
for
several
it
happened
once
that
the
teacher
did
not
come
for
the
usual
hour
of
instruction
as
long
as
we
children
were
all
together
we
entertained
ourselves
quite
agreeably
but
when
my
adherents
after
waiting
long
enough
went
away
and
i
remained
alone
with
three
of
my
enemies
these
took
it
into
their
heads
to
torment
me
to
shame
me
and
to
drive
me
away
having
left
me
an
instant
in
the
room
they
came
back
with
switches
which
they
had
made
by
quickly
cutting
up
a
broom
i
noted
their
design
and
as
i
supposed
the
end
of
the
hour
near
i
at
once
resolved
not
to
resist
them
till
the
clock
struck
they
began
therefore
without
remorse
to
lash
my
legs
and
calves
in
the
cruellest
fashion
i
did
not
stir
but
soon
felt
that
i
had
miscalculated
and
that
such
pain
greatly
lengthened
the
minutes
my
wrath
grew
with
my
endurance
and
at
the
first
stroke
of
the
hour
i
grasped
the
one
who
least
expected
it
by
the
hair
behind
hurled
him
to
the
earth
in
an
instant
pressing
my
knee
upon
his
back
the
second
a
younger
and
weaker
ore
who
attacked
me
from
behind
i
drew
by
the
head
under
my
arm
and
almost
throttled
him
with
the
pressure
the
last
and
not
the
weakest
still
remained
and
my
left
hand
only
was
left
for
my
defence
but
i
seized
him
by
the
clothes
and
with
a
dexterous
twist
on
my
part
and
an
over
precipitate
one
on
his
i
brought
him
down
and
struck
his
face
on
the
ground
they
were
not
wanting
in
bites
pinches
and
kicks
but
i
had
nothing
but
revenge
in
my
limbs
as
well
as
in
my
heart
with
the
advantage
which
i
had
acquired
i
repeatedly
knocked
their
heads
together
at
last
they
raised
a
dreadful
shout
of
murder
and
were
were
soon
surrounded
by
all
the
inmates
of
the
house
the
switches
scattered
around
and
my
legs
which
i
had
bared
of
the
stockings
soon
bore
witness
for
me
they
put
off
the
punishment
and
let
me
leave
the
house
but
i
declared
that
in
future
on
the
slightest
offence
i
would
scratch
out
the
eyes
tear
off
the
ears
of
any
one
of
them
if
not
throttle
him
this
event
though
as
usually
happens
in
childish
affairs
it
was
soon
forgotten
and
even
laughed
over
was
yet
the
cause
that
these
instructions
in
common
became
fewer
and
at
last
entirely
ceased
i
was
thus
again
as
formerly
kept
more
at
home
where
i
found
my
sister
cornelia
who
was
only
one
year
younger
than
myself
a
companion
always
growing
more
agreeable
still
i
will
not
leave
this
topic
without
narrating
some
more
stories
of
the
many
vexations
caused
me
by
my
playfellows
for
this
is
the
instructive
part
of
such
moral
communications
that
a
man
may
learn
how
it
has
gone
with
others
and
what
he
also
has
to
expect
from
life
and
that
whatever
comes
to
pass
he
may
consider
that
it
happens
to
him
as
a
man
and
not
as
one
specially
fortunate
or
unfortunate
if
such
knowledge
is
of
little
use
for
avoiding
evils
it
is
very
serviceable
so
far
as
it
qualifies
us
to
understand
our
condition
and
bear
or
even
to
overcome
it
another
general
remark
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
which
is
that
as
the
children
of
the
cultivated
classes
grow
up
a
great
contradiction
appears
i
refer
to
the
fact
that
they
are
urged
and
trained
by
parents
and
teachers
to
deport
themselves
moderately
intelligently
and
even
wisely
to
give
pain
to
no
one
from
petulance
or
arrogance
and
to
suppress
all
the
evil
impulses
which
may
be
developed
in
them
but
yet
on
the
other
hand
while
the
young
creatures
are
engaged
in
this
discipline
they
have
to
suffer
from
others
that
which
in
them
is
reprimanded
and
punished
in
this
way
the
poor
things
are
brought
into
a
sad
strait
between
the
natural
and
civilised
states
and
after
restraining
themselves
for
a
while
break
out
according
to
their
characters
into
cunning
or
violence
rudeness
of
juvenile
companions
force
is
rather
to
be
put
down
by
force
but
a
child
inclined
to
love
and
sympathy
has
little
to
oppose
to
scorn
and
though
i
managed
pretty
well
to
keep
off
the
active
assaults
of
my
companions
i
was
by
no
means
equal
to
them
in
sarcasm
and
abuse
because
he
who
merely
defends
himself
in
such
cases
is
always
a
loser
attacks
of
this
sort
consequently
when
they
went
so
far
as
to
excite
anger
were
repelled
with
physical
force
or
at
least
excited
strange
reflections
in
me
which
could
not
be
without
results
among
other
advantages
which
my
grudged
me
was
the
pleasure
i
took
in
the
relations
that
accrued
to
the
family
from
my
grandfather
position
of
schultheiss
since
as
he
was
the
first
of
his
class
this
had
no
small
effect
on
those
belonging
to
him
once
when
after
the
holding
of
the
i
appeared
to
pride
myself
on
having
seen
my
grandfather
in
the
midst
of
the
council
one
step
higher
than
the
rest
enthroned
as
it
were
under
the
portrait
of
the
emperor
one
of
the
boys
said
to
me
in
derision
that
like
the
peacock
contemplating
his
feet
i
should
cast
my
eyes
back
to
my
paternal
grandfather
who
had
been
keeper
of
the
and
would
never
have
aspired
to
thrones
and
coronets
i
replied
that
i
was
in
no
wise
ashamed
of
that
as
it
was
the
glory
and
honour
of
our
native
city
that
all
its
citizens
might
consider
each
other
equal
and
every
one
derive
profit
and
honour
from
his
exertions
in
his
own
way
i
was
sorry
only
that
the
good
man
had
been
so
long
dead
for
i
had
often
yearned
to
know
him
in
person
had
many
times
gazed
upon
his
likeness
nay
had
visited
his
tomb
and
had
at
least
derived
pleasure
from
the
inscription
on
the
simple
monument
of
that
past
existence
to
which
i
was
indebted
for
my
own
another
who
was
the
most
malicious
of
all
took
the
first
aside
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
while
they
still
looked
at
me
scornfully
my
gall
already
began
to
rise
and
i
challenged
them
to
speak
out
what
is
more
then
if
you
will
have
it
continued
the
first
this
one
thinks
you
might
go
looking
about
a
long
time
before
you
could
find
your
grandfather
i
now
threatened
them
more
vehemently
if
they
did
not
more
clearly
explain
themselves
thereupon
they
brought
forward
an
old
story
which
they
pretended
to
have
overheard
from
their
parents
that
my
father
was
the
son
of
some
eminent
man
while
that
good
citizen
had
shown
himself
willing
to
take
outwardly
the
paternal
office
they
had
the
impudence
to
produce
all
sorts
of
arguments
as
for
example
that
our
property
came
exclusively
from
our
grandmother
that
the
other
collateral
relations
who
lived
in
friedburg
and
other
places
were
all
alike
destitute
of
property
and
other
reasons
of
the
sort
which
could
merely
derive
their
weight
from
malice
i
listened
to
them
more
composedly
than
they
expected
for
they
stood
ready
to
fly
the
very
moment
that
i
should
make
a
gesture
as
if
i
would
seize
their
hair
but
i
replied
quite
calmly
and
in
substance
that
even
this
was
no
great
injury
to
me
life
was
such
a
boon
that
one
might
be
quite
indifferent
as
to
whom
one
had
to
thank
for
it
since
at
least
it
must
be
derived
from
god
before
whom
we
all
were
equals
as
they
could
make
nothing
of
it
they
let
the
matter
drop
for
this
time
we
went
on
playing
together
as
before
which
among
children
is
an
approved
mode
of
reconciliation
goethe
reputed
grandfather
still
those
spiteful
words
inoculated
me
with
a
sort
of
moral
disease
which
crept
on
in
secret
it
would
not
have
displeased
me
at
all
to
have
been
the
grandson
of
any
person
of
consideration
even
if
it
had
not
been
in
the
most
lawful
way
my
acuteness
followed
up
the
scent
my
imagination
was
excited
and
my
sagacity
put
in
requisition
i
began
to
investigate
the
allegation
and
invented
or
found
for
it
new
grounds
of
probability
i
had
heard
little
said
of
my
grandfather
except
that
his
likeness
together
with
my
grandmother
had
hung
in
a
parlour
of
the
old
house
both
of
which
after
the
building
of
the
new
one
had
been
kept
in
an
upper
chamber
my
grandmother
must
have
been
a
very
handsome
woman
and
of
the
same
age
as
her
husband
i
remembered
also
to
have
seen
in
her
room
the
miniature
of
a
handsome
gentleman
in
uniform
with
star
and
order
which
after
her
death
and
during
the
confusion
of
had
disappeared
with
many
other
small
pieces
of
furniture
these
and
many
other
things
i
put
together
in
my
childish
head
and
exercised
that
modern
poetical
talent
which
contrives
to
obtain
the
sympathies
of
the
whole
cultivated
world
by
a
marvellous
combination
of
the
important
events
of
human
life
but
as
i
did
not
venture
to
trust
such
an
affair
to
any
one
or
even
to
ask
the
most
remote
questions
concerning
it
i
was
not
wanting
in
a
secret
diligence
in
order
to
get
if
possible
somewhat
nearer
to
the
matter
i
had
heard
it
explicitly
maintained
that
sons
often
bore
a
decided
resemblance
to
their
fathers
or
grandfathers
many
of
our
friends
especially
councillor
schneider
a
friend
of
the
family
were
connected
by
business
with
all
the
princes
and
noblemen
of
the
neighbourhood
of
whom
including
both
the
ruling
and
the
younger
branches
not
a
few
had
estates
on
the
rhine
and
maine
and
in
the
intermediate
country
and
who
at
times
honoured
their
faithful
agents
with
their
portraits
these
which
i
had
often
seen
on
the
walls
from
my
infancy
i
now
regarded
with
redoubled
attention
seeking
whether
i
could
not
detect
some
resemblance
to
my
father
or
even
to
myself
which
too
often
happened
to
lead
me
to
any
degree
of
certainty
for
now
it
was
the
eyes
of
this
now
the
nose
of
that
which
seemed
to
indicate
some
relationship
thus
these
marks
led
me
delusively
backwards
and
forwards
and
though
in
the
end
i
was
compelled
to
regard
the
reproach
as
a
completely
empty
tale
the
impression
remained
and
i
could
not
from
time
to
time
refrain
from
privately
calling
up
and
testing
all
the
noblemen
whose
images
had
remained
very
clear
in
my
fancy
so
true
is
it
that
whatever
inwardly
confirms
man
in
his
self
conceit
or
flatters
his
secret
vanity
is
so
highly
desirable
to
him
that
he
does
not
ask
further
whether
in
other
respects
it
may
turn
to
his
honour
or
his
disgrace
but
instead
of
mingling
here
serious
and
even
reproachful
reflections
i
rather
turn
my
look
away
from
those
beautiful
times
for
who
is
able
to
speak
worthily
of
the
fulness
of
childhood
we
can
not
behold
the
little
creatures
which
flit
about
before
us
otherwise
delight
nay
with
admiration
for
they
generally
promise
more
than
they
perform
and
it
seems
that
nature
among
the
other
roguish
tricks
that
she
plays
us
here
also
especially
designs
to
make
sport
of
us
the
first
organs
she
bestows
upon
children
coming
into
the
world
are
adapted
to
the
nearest
immediate
condition
of
the
creature
which
unassuming
and
artless
makes
use
of
them
in
the
readiest
way
for
its
present
purposes
the
child
considered
in
and
for
itself
with
its
equals
and
in
relations
suited
to
its
powers
seems
so
intelligent
and
rational
and
at
the
same
time
so
easy
cheerful
and
clever
that
one
can
hardly
wish
it
further
cultivation
if
children
grew
up
according
to
early
indications
we
should
have
nothing
but
geniuses
but
growth
is
not
merely
development
the
various
organic
systems
which
constitute
one
man
spring
one
from
another
follow
each
other
change
into
each
other
supplant
each
other
and
even
consume
each
other
so
that
after
a
time
scarcely
a
trace
is
to
be
found
of
many
aptitudes
and
manifestations
of
ability
even
when
the
talents
of
the
man
have
on
the
whole
a
decided
direction
it
will
be
hard
for
the
greatest
and
most
experienced
connoisseur
to
declare
them
beforehand
with
confidence
although
afterwards
it
is
easy
to
remark
what
has
pointed
to
a
future
by
no
means
therefore
is
it
my
design
wholly
to
comprise
the
stories
of
my
childhood
in
these
first
books
but
i
will
rather
afterwards
resume
and
continue
many
a
thread
which
ran
through
the
early
years
unnoticed
here
however
i
must
remark
what
an
increasing
influence
the
incidents
of
the
war
gradually
exercised
upon
our
sentiments
and
mode
of
life
the
peaceful
citizen
stands
in
a
wonderful
relation
to
the
great
events
of
the
world
they
already
excite
and
disquiet
him
from
a
distance
and
even
if
they
do
not
touch
him
he
can
scarcely
refrain
from
an
opinion
and
a
sympathy
soon
he
takes
a
side
as
his
character
or
external
circumstances
may
determine
but
when
such
grand
fatalities
such
important
changes
draw
nearer
to
him
then
with
many
outward
inconveniences
remains
that
inward
discomfort
which
doubles
and
sharpens
the
evil
and
destroys
the
good
which
is
still
possible
then
he
has
really
to
suffer
from
friends
and
foes
often
more
from
those
than
from
these
and
he
knows
not
how
to
secure
and
preserve
either
his
interests
or
his
inclinations
feelings
of
the
frankforters
in
the
year
which
still
passed
in
perfectly
civic
tranquillity
kept
us
nevertheless
in
great
uneasiness
of
mind
perhaps
no
other
was
more
fruitful
of
events
than
this
conquests
achievements
misfortunes
restorations
followed
one
upon
another
swallowed
up
and
seemed
to
destroy
each
other
yet
the
image
of
frederick
his
name
and
glory
soon
hovered
again
above
all
the
enthusiasm
of
his
worshippers
grew
always
stronger
and
more
animated
the
hatred
of
his
enemies
more
bitter
and
the
diversity
of
opinion
which
separated
even
families
contributed
not
a
little
to
isolate
citizens
already
sundered
in
many
ways
and
on
other
grounds
for
in
a
city
like
frankfort
where
three
religions
divide
the
inhabitants
into
three
unequal
masses
where
only
a
few
men
even
of
the
ruling
faith
can
attain
to
political
power
there
must
be
many
wealthy
and
educated
persons
who
are
thrown
back
upon
themselves
and
by
means
of
studies
and
tastes
form
for
themselves
an
individual
and
secluded
existence
it
will
be
necessary
for
us
to
speak
of
such
men
now
and
hereafter
if
we
are
to
bring
before
us
the
peculiarities
of
a
frankfort
citizen
of
that
time
my
father
immediately
after
his
return
from
his
travels
had
in
his
own
way
formed
the
design
that
to
prepare
himself
for
the
service
of
the
city
he
would
undertake
one
of
the
subordinate
offices
and
discharge
its
duties
without
emolument
if
it
were
conferred
upon
him
without
balloting
in
the
consciousness
of
his
good
intentions
and
according
to
his
way
of
thinking
and
the
conception
which
he
had
of
himself
he
believed
that
he
deserved
such
a
distinction
which
indeed
was
not
conformable
to
law
or
precedent
consequently
when
his
suit
was
rejected
he
fell
into
and
disgust
vowed
that
he
would
never
accept
of
any
place
and
in
order
to
render
it
impossible
procured
the
title
of
imperial
councillor
which
the
schultheiss
and
elder
bear
as
a
special
honour
he
had
thus
made
himself
an
equal
of
the
highest
and
could
not
begin
again
at
the
bottom
the
same
impulse
induced
him
also
to
woo
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
schultheiss
so
that
he
was
excluded
from
the
council
on
this
side
also
he
was
now
of
that
number
of
recluses
who
never
form
themselves
into
a
society
they
are
as
much
isolated
in
respect
to
each
other
as
they
are
in
regard
to
the
whole
and
the
more
so
as
in
this
seclusion
the
character
becomes
more
and
more
uncouth
my
father
in
his
travels
and
in
the
world
which
he
had
seen
might
have
formed
some
conception
of
a
more
elegant
and
liberal
mode
of
life
than
was
perhaps
common
among
his
in
this
respect
however
he
was
not
entirely
without
predecessors
and
associates
the
name
of
uffenbach
is
well
known
at
that
time
there
was
a
schöff
von
uffenbach
who
was
generally
respected
he
had
been
in
italy
had
applied
himself
particularly
to
music
sang
an
agreeable
tenor
and
having
brought
home
a
fine
collection
of
pieces
concerts
and
oratorios
were
performed
at
his
house
now
as
he
sang
in
these
himself
and
held
musicians
in
great
favour
it
was
not
thought
altogether
suitable
to
his
dignity
and
his
invited
guests
as
well
as
the
other
people
of
the
country
allowed
themselves
many
a
jocose
remark
on
the
matter
i
remember
too
a
baron
von
hakel
a
rich
nobleman
who
being
married
but
childless
occupied
a
charming
house
in
the
fitted
up
with
all
the
appurtenances
of
a
dignified
position
in
life
he
also
possessed
good
pictures
engravings
antiques
and
much
else
which
generally
accumulates
with
collectors
and
lovers
of
art
from
time
to
time
he
asked
the
more
noted
personages
to
dinner
and
was
beneficent
in
a
careful
way
of
his
own
since
he
clothed
the
poor
in
his
own
house
but
kept
back
their
old
rags
and
gave
them
a
weekly
charity
on
condition
that
they
should
present
themselves
every
time
clean
and
neat
in
the
clothes
bestowed
on
them
i
can
recall
him
but
indistinctly
as
a
genial
man
but
more
clearly
his
auction
which
i
attended
from
beginning
to
end
and
partly
by
command
of
my
father
partly
from
my
own
impulse
purchased
many
things
that
are
still
to
be
found
in
my
collections
at
an
earlier
date
than
this
so
early
that
i
scarcely
set
eyes
upon
him

michael
von
loen
gained
considerable
repute
in
the
literary
world
as
well
as
at
frankfort
not
a
native
of
frankfort
he
settled
there
and
married
a
sister
of
my
grandmother
textor
whose
was
lindheim
familiar
with
the
court
and
political
world
and
rejoicing
in
a
renewed
title
of
nobility
he
had
acquired
reputation
by
daring
to
take
part
in
the
various
excitements
which
arose
in
church
and
state
he
wrote
the
of
a
didactic
romance
the
subject
of
which
is
made
apparent
by
the
second
title
or
the
honest
man
at
court
this
work
was
well
received
because
it
insisted
on
morality
even
in
courts
where
prudence
only
is
generally
at
home
and
thus
his
labour
brought
him
applause
and
respect
a
second
work
for
that
very
reason
would
be
accompanied
by
more
danger
he
wrote
only
true
a
book
designed
to
advance
tolerance
especially
between
lutherans
and
calvinists
but
here
he
got
in
a
controversy
with
the
theologians
one
benner
of
giessen
in
particular
wrote
against
him
von
loen
rejoined
the
contest
grew
violent
and
personal
and
the
unpleasantness
which
arose
from
it
caused
him
to
accept
the
office
of
president
at
lingen
which
frederick
ii
offered
him
supposing
that
he
was
an
enlightened
unprejudiced
man
and
not
averse
to
the
new
views
that
more
extensively
obtained
in
france
his
former
countrymen
whom
he
left
in
some
displeasure
averred
that
he
was
not
contented
there
nay
could
not
be
so
as
a
place
like
lingen
was
not
to
be
compared
with
frankfort
my
father
also
doubted
whether
the
president
would
be
happy
and
asserted
that
the
good
uncle
would
have
done
better
not
to
connect
himself
with
the
king
as
it
was
generally
hazardous
to
get
too
near
him
extraordinary
sovereign
as
he
undoubtedly
was
for
it
had
been
seen
how
disgracefully
the
famous
voltaire
had
been
arrested
in
frankfort
at
the
requisition
of
the
prussian
resident
freitag
though
he
had
formerly
stood
so
high
in
favour
and
had
been
regarded
as
the
king
teacher
in
french
poetry
there
was
no
want
on
such
occasions
of
reflections
and
examples
to
warn
one
against
courts
and
princes
service
of
which
a
native
frankforter
could
scarcely
form
a
conception
dr
orth
an
excellent
man
orth
i
will
only
mention
by
name
because
here
i
have
not
so
much
to
erect
a
monument
to
the
deserving
citizens
of
frankfort
but
rather
refer
to
them
so
far
forth
as
their
renown
or
personal
character
had
some
influence
upon
me
in
my
earliest
years
orth
was
a
wealthy
man
and
was
also
of
that
number
who
never
took
part
in
the
government
although
perfectly
qualified
to
do
so
by
his
knowledge
and
penetration
the
antiquities
of
germany
and
more
especially
of
frankfort
have
been
much
indebted
to
him
he
published
remarks
on
the
of
a
work
in
which
the
statutes
of
the
state
are
collected
the
historical
portions
of
this
book
i
diligently
read
in
my
youth
von
ochsenstein
the
eldest
of
the
three
brothers
whom
i
have
mentioned
above
as
our
neighbours
had
not
been
remarkable
during
his
lifetime
in
consequence
of
his
recluse
habits
but
became
the
more
remarkable
after
his
death
by
leaving
behind
him
a
direction
that
common
should
carry
him
to
the
grave
early
in
the
morning
in
perfect
silence
and
without
an
attendant
or
follower
this
was
done
and
the
affair
excited
great
attention
in
the
city
where
they
were
accustomed
to
the
most
pompous
funerals
all
who
discharged
the
customary
offices
on
such
occasions
rose
against
the
innovation
but
the
stout
patrician
found
imitators
in
all
classes
and
though
such
ceremonies
were
derisively
called
they
came
into
fashion
to
the
advantage
of
many
of
the
more
families
while
funeral
parades
were
less
and
less
in
vogue
i
bring
forward
this
circumstance
because
it
presents
one
of
the
earlier
symptoms
of
that
tendency
to
humility
and
equality
which
in
the
second
half
of
the
last
century
was
manifested
in
so
many
ways
from
above
downwards
and
broke
out
in
such
effects
nor
was
there
any
lack
of
antiquarian
amateurs
there
were
cabinets
of
pictures
collections
of
engravings
while
the
curiosities
of
our
own
country
especially
were
zealously
sought
and
hoarded
the
older
decrees
and
mandates
of
the
imperial
city
of
which
no
collection
had
been
prepared
were
carefully
searched
for
in
print
and
manuscript
arranged
in
the
order
of
time
and
preserved
with
reverence
as
a
treasure
of
native
laws
and
customs
the
portraits
of
frankforters
which
existed
in
great
number
were
also
brought
together
and
formed
a
special
department
of
the
cabinets
such
men
my
father
appears
generally
to
have
taken
as
his
models
he
was
wanting
in
none
of
the
qualities
that
pertain
to
an
upright
and
respectable
citizen
thus
after
he
had
built
his
house
he
put
his
property
of
every
sort
into
order
an
excellent
collection
of
maps
by
schenck
and
other
geographers
at
that
time
eminent
the
aforesaid
decrees
and
mandates
the
portraits
a
chest
of
ancient
weapons
a
case
of
remarkable
venetian
glasses
cups
and
goblets
natural
curiosities
works
in
ivory
bronzes
and
a
hundred
other
things
were
separated
and
displayed
and
i
did
not
fail
whenever
an
auction
occurred
to
get
some
commission
for
the
increase
of
his
possessions
the
senkenbergs
i
must
still
speak
of
one
important
family
of
which
i
had
heard
strange
things
since
my
earliest
years
and
of
some
of
whose
members
i
myself
lived
to
see
a
great
deal
that
was
wonderful
i
mean
the
senkenbergs
the
father
of
whom
i
have
little
to
say
was
an
opulent
man
he
had
three
sons
who
even
in
their
youth
uniformly
distinguished
themselves
as
oddities
such
things
are
not
well
received
in
a
limited
city
where
no
one
is
suffered
to
render
himself
conspicuous
either
for
good
or
evil
nicknames
and
odd
stories
long
kept
in
memory
are
generally
the
fruit
of
such
singularity
the
father
lived
at
the
corner
of
hasengasse
which
took
its
name
from
a
sign
on
the
house
that
represented
one
hare
at
least
if
not
three
hares
they
consequently
called
these
three
brothers
only
the
three
hares
which
they
could
not
shake
off
for
a
long
while
but
as
great
endowments
often
announce
themselves
in
youth
in
the
form
of
singularity
and
awkwardness
so
was
it
also
in
this
case
the
eldest
of
the
brothers
was
the
imperial
councillor
von
senkenberg
afterwards
so
celebrated
the
second
was
admitted
into
the
magistracy
and
displayed
eminent
abilities
which
however
he
subsequently
abused
in
a
pettifogging
and
even
infamous
way
if
not
to
the
injury
of
his
native
city
certainly
to
that
of
his
colleagues
the
third
brother
a
physician
and
man
of
great
integrity
but
who
practised
little
and
that
only
in
high
families
preserved
even
in
his
old
age
a
somewhat
whimsical
exterior
he
was
always
very
neatly
dressed
and
was
never
seen
in
the
street
otherwise
than
in
shoes
and
stockings
with
a
curled
wig
and
his
hat
under
his
arm
he
walked
on
rapidly
but
with
a
singular
sort
of
stagger
so
that
he
was
sometimes
on
one
and
sometimes
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
and
formed
a
complete
zigzag
as
he
went
the
wags
said
that
he
made
this
irregular
step
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
departed
souls
who
might
follow
him
in
a
straight
line
and
that
he
imitated
those
who
are
afraid
of
a
crocodile
but
all
these
jests
and
many
merry
sayings
were
transformed
at
last
into
respect
for
him
when
he
devoted
his
handsome
in
with
court
garden
and
all
other
appurtenances
to
a
medical
establishment
where
in
addition
to
a
hospital
designed
exclusively
for
the
citizens
of
frankfort
a
botanic
garden
an
anatomical
theatre
a
chemical
laboratory
a
considerable
library
and
a
house
for
the
director
were
instituted
in
a
way
of
which
no
university
need
have
been
ashamed
another
eminent
man
whose
efficiency
in
the
neighbourhood
and
whose
writings
rather
than
his
presence
had
a
very
important
influence
upon
me
was
charles
frederick
von
moser
who
was
perpetually
referred
to
in
our
district
for
his
activity
in
business
he
also
had
a
character
essentially
moral
which
as
the
vices
of
human
nature
frequently
gave
him
trouble
inclined
him
to
the
pious
thus
what
von
loen
had
tried
to
do
in
respect
to
court
life
he
would
have
done
for
introducing
into
it
a
more
conscientious
mode
of
proceeding
the
great
number
of
small
german
courts
gave
rise
to
a
multitude
of
princes
and
servants
the
former
of
whom
desired
unconditional
obedience
while
the
latter
for
the
most
part
would
work
or
serve
only
according
to
their
own
convictions
thus
arose
an
endless
conflict
and
rapid
changes
and
explosions
because
the
effects
of
an
unrestricted
course
of
proceeding
become
much
sooner
noticeable
and
injurious
on
a
small
scale
than
on
a
large
one
many
families
were
in
debt
and
imperial
commissions
of
debts
were
appointed
others
found
themselves
sooner
or
later
on
the
same
road
while
the
officers
either
reaped
an
unconscionable
profit
or
conscientiously
made
themselves
disagreeable
and
odious
moser
wished
to
act
as
a
statesman
and
man
of
business
and
here
his
hereditary
talent
cultivated
to
a
profession
gave
him
a
decided
advantage
but
he
at
the
same
time
wished
to
act
as
a
man
and
a
citizen
and
surrender
little
as
possible
of
his
moral
dignity
his
and
his
in
the
lions
his
paint
throughout
his
own
condition
in
which
he
felt
himself
not
indeed
tortured
but
always
cramped
they
all
indicate
impatience
in
a
condition
to
the
bearings
of
which
one
can
not
reconcile
oneself
yet
from
which
one
can
not
get
free
with
this
mode
of
thinking
and
feeling
he
was
indeed
often
compelled
to
seek
other
employments
which
on
account
of
his
great
cleverness
were
never
wanting
i
remember
him
as
a
pleasing
active
and
at
the
same
time
gentle
man
klopstock
messiah
the
name
of
klopstock
had
already
produced
a
great
effect
upon
us
even
at
a
distance
in
the
outset
people
wondered
how
so
excellent
a
man
could
be
so
strangely
named
but
they
soon
got
accustomed
to
this
and
thought
no
more
of
the
meaning
of
the
syllables
in
my
father
library
i
had
hitherto
found
only
the
earlier
poets
especially
those
who
in
his
day
had
gradually
appeared
and
acquired
fame
all
these
had
written
in
rhyme
and
my
father
held
rhyme
as
indispensable
in
poetical
works
canitz
hagedorn
drollinger
gellert
creuz
haller
stood
in
a
row
in
handsome
calf
bindings
to
these
were
added
neukirch
koppen
and
other
translations
i
had
from
my
childhood
diligently
read
through
the
whole
of
these
works
and
committed
portions
to
memory
whence
i
was
often
called
upon
to
amuse
the
company
a
vexatious
era
on
the
other
hand
opened
upon
my
father
when
through
klopstock
verses
which
seemed
to
him
no
verses
became
an
object
of
public
admiration
he
had
taken
good
care
not
to
buy
this
book
but
the
friend
of
the
family
councillor
schneider
smuggled
it
in
and
slipped
it
into
the
hands
of
my
mother
and
her
children
on
this
man
of
business
who
read
but
little
the
as
soon
as
it
appeared
made
a
powerful
impression
those
pious
feelings
so
naturally
expressed
and
yet
so
beautifully
elevated
that
agreeable
language
even
if
considered
merely
as
harmonious
prose
had
so
won
the
otherwise
dry
man
of
business
that
he
regarded
the
first
ten
cantos
of
which
alone
we
are
properly
speaking
as
the
finest
book
of
devotion
and
once
every
year
in
passion
week
when
he
managed
to
escape
from
business
read
it
quietly
through
by
himself
and
thus
refreshed
himself
for
the
entire
year
in
the
beginning
he
thought
to
communicate
his
emotions
to
his
old
friend
but
he
was
much
shocked
when
forced
to
perceive
an
incurable
dislike
cherished
against
a
book
of
such
valuable
substance
merely
because
of
what
appeared
to
him
an
indifferent
external
form
it
may
readily
be
supposed
that
their
conversation
often
reverted
to
this
topic
but
both
parties
diverged
more
and
more
widely
from
each
other
there
were
violent
scenes
and
the
compliant
man
was
at
last
pleased
to
be
silent
on
his
favourite
work
that
he
might
not
lose
at
the
same
time
a
friend
of
his
youth
and
a
good
sunday
meal
it
is
the
most
natural
wish
of
every
man
to
make
proselytes
and
how
much
did
our
friend
find
himself
rewarded
in
secret
when
he
discovered
in
the
rest
of
the
family
hearts
so
openly
disposed
for
his
saint
the
copy
which
he
used
only
one
week
during
the
year
was
devoted
to
us
all
the
remaining
time
my
mother
kept
it
secret
and
we
children
took
possession
of
it
when
we
could
that
in
leisure
hours
hidden
in
some
nook
we
might
learn
the
most
striking
passages
by
heart
and
particularly
might
impress
the
most
tender
as
well
as
the
most
violent
parts
on
our
memory
as
quickly
as
possible
porcia
dream
we
recited
in
a
sort
of
rivalry
and
divided
between
us
the
mid
dialogue
of
despair
between
satan
and
adramelech
who
have
been
cast
into
the
red
sea
the
first
part
as
the
strongest
had
been
assigned
to
me
and
the
second
as
a
little
more
pathetic
was
undertaken
by
my
sister
the
alternate
and
horrible
but
curses
flowed
only
thus
from
our
mouths
and
we
seized
every
opportunity
to
accost
each
other
with
these
infernal
phrases
one
saturday
evening
in
winter
my
father
always
had
himself
shaved
over
night
that
on
sunday
morning
he
might
dress
himself
for
church
at
his
ease
we
sat
on
a
footstool
behind
the
stove
and
muttered
our
customary
imprecations
in
a
tolerably
low
voice
while
the
barber
was
putting
on
the
lather
but
now
adramelech
had
to
lay
his
iron
hands
on
satan
my
sister
seized
me
with
violence
and
recited
softly
enough
but
with
increasing
passion
give
me
thine
aid
i
intreat
thee
will
worship
thee
if
thou
requirest
thee
thou
monster
abandoned
yes
thee
of
all
criminals
blackest
aid
me
i
suffer
the
tortures
of
death
which
is
vengeful
eternal
once
in
the
times
gone
by
with
a
hot
fierce
hate
i
could
hate
thee
now
i
can
hate
thee
no
more
this
is
the
sharpest
of
tortures
klopstock

thus
far
all
went
on
tolerably
but
loudly
with
a
dreadful
voice
she
cried
the
following
words
how

crushed
the
good
surgeon
was
startled
and
emptied
the
into
my
father
bosom
there
was
a
great
uproar
and
a
severe
investigation
wis
held
especially
with
respect
to
the
mischief
which
might
have
been
done
if
the
shaving
had
been
actually
going
forward
in
order
to
relieve
ourselves
of
all
suspicious
of
wantonness
in
the
affair
we
confessed
our
satanic
characters
and
the
misfortune
occasioned
by
the
hexameters
was
so
apparent
that
they
were
again
condemned
and
banished
thin
children
and
common
people
are
accustomed
to
transform
the
great
and
sublime
into
a
sport
and
even
a
jest
and
how
indeed
could
they
otherwise
abide
and
tolerate
it
a
pun
upon
the
name
of
the
is
written
in
hexameter
third
book
at
that
time
the
general
interchange
of
personal
good
wishes
made
the
city
very
lively
on
new
year
day
those
who
otherwise
did
not
easily
leave
home
donned
their
best
clothes
that
for
a
moment
they
might
be
friendly
and
courteous
to
their
friends
and
patrons
the
festivities
at
my
grandfather
house
on
this
day
were
pleasures
particularly
desired
by
us
children
at
early
dawn
the
grandchildren
had
already
assembled
there
to
hear
the
drums
oboes
clarionets
trumpets
and
cornets
played
upon
by
the
military
the
city
musicians
and
whoever
else
might
furnish
his
tones
the
new
year
gifts
sealed
and
superscribed
were
divided
by
us
children
among
the
humbler
congratulators
and
as
the
day
advanced
the
number
of
those
of
higher
rank
increased
the
relations
and
intimate
friends
appeared
first
then
the
subordinate
officials
even
the
gentlemen
of
the
council
did
not
fail
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
and
a
select
number
were
entertained
in
the
evening
in
rooms
which
were
else
scarcely
opened
throughout
the
year
the
tarts
biscuits
marchpane
and
sweet
wine
had
the
greatest
charm
for
the
children
and
besides
the
and
the
two
burgomasters
annually
received
from
some
institutions
some
article
of
silver
which
was
then
bestowed
upon
the
grandchildren
and
godchildren
in
regular
gradation
in
fine
this
small
festival
was
not
wanting
in
any
of
those
things
which
usually
glorify
the
greatest
occupation
of
frankfort
by
the
french
the
new
year
day
of
approached
as
desirable
and
pleasant
to
us
children
as
any
preceding
one
but
full
of
import
and
foreboding
to
older
persons
to
the
passage
of
the
french
troops
people
certainly
had
become
accustomed
and
they
happened
often
but
they
had
been
most
frequent
in
the
last
days
of
the
past
year
according
to
the
old
usage
of
an
imperial
town
the
warder
of
the
chief
tower
sounded
his
trumpet
whenever
troops
approached
and
on
this
new
year
day
he
would
not
leave
off
which
was
a
sign
that
large
bodies
were
in
motion
on
several
sides
they
actually
marched
through
the
city
in
greater
masses
on
this
day
and
the
people
ran
to
see
them
pass
by
we
had
generally
been
used
to
see
them
go
through
in
small
parties
but
these
gradually
swelled
and
there
was
neither
power
nor
inclination
to
stop
them
in
short
on
the
of
january
after
a
column
had
come
through
sachsenhausen
over
the
bridge
through
the
fahrgasse
as
far
as
the
police
guard
house
it
halted
overpowered
the
small
company
which
escorted
it
took
possession
of
the
guard
house
marched
down
the
zeil
and
after
a
slight
resistance
the
main
guard
were
also
obliged
to
yield
in
a
moment
the
peaceful
streets
were
turned
into
a
scene
of
war
the
troops
remained
and
bivouacked
there
until
lodgings
were
provided
for
them
by
regular
billetting
this
unexpected
and
for
many
years
burden
weighed
heavily
upon
the
comfortable
citizens
and
to
none
could
it
be
more
cumbersome
than
to
my
father
who
was
obliged
to
take
foreign
military
inhabitants
into
his
scarcely
finished
house
to
open
for
them
his
reception
rooms
which
were
generally
closed
and
to
abandon
to
the
caprices
of
strangers
all
that
he
had
been
used
to
arrange
and
keep
so
carefully
siding
as
he
did
with
the
prussians
he
was
now
to
find
himself
besieged
in
his
own
chambers
by
the
french
it
was
according
to
his
way
of
thinking
the
greatest
misfortune
that
could
happen
to
him
had
it
however
been
possible
for
him
to
have
taken
the
matter
more
easily
he
might
have
saved
himself
and
us
many
sad
hours
since
he
spoke
french
well
and
could
deport
himself
with
dignity
and
grace
in
the
daily
intercourse
of
life
for
it
was
the
king
lieutenant
who
was
quartered
on
us
and
he
although
a
military
person
had
only
to
settle
civil
occurrences
disputes
between
soldiers
and
citizens
and
questions
of
debt
and
quarrels
this
was
the
count
thorane
a
native
of
grasse
in
provence
not
far
from
antibes
a
tall
thin
stem
figure
with
a
face
much
disfigured
by
the
small
pox
black
fiery
eyes
and
a
dignified
reserved
demeanour
his
first
entrance
was
at
once
favourable
for
the
inmates
of
the
house
they
spoke
of
the
different
apartments
some
of
which
were
to
be
given
up
and
others
retained
by
the
family
and
when
the
count
heard
a
mentioned
he
immediately
requested
permission
although
it
was
already
night
at
least
to
give
a
hasty
look
at
the
pictures
by
candlelight
he
took
extreme
pleasure
in
these
things
behaved
in
the
most
obliging
manner
to
my
father
who
accompanied
him
and
when
he
heard
that
the
greater
part
of
the
artists
were
still
living
and
resided
in
frankfort
and
its
neighbourhood
he
assured
us
that
he
desired
nothing
more
than
to
know
them
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
employ
them
but
even
this
sympathy
in
respect
to
art
could
not
change
my
feelings
nor
bend
his
character
he
permitted
what
he
could
not
prevent
but
kept
at
a
distance
in
inactivity
and
the
uncommon
state
of
things
around
him
was
intolerable
to
him
even
in
the
veriest
trifle
count
thorane
count
thorane
behaved
himself
meanwhile
in
an
exemplary
manner
he
would
not
even
have
his
maps
nailed
on
the
walls
that
he
might
not
injure
the
new
hangings
his
people
were
skilful
quiet
and
orderly
but
in
truth
as
during
the
whole
day
and
a
part
of
the
night
there
was
no
quiet
with
him
one
complainant
quickly
following
another
arrested
persons
being
brought
in
and
led
out
and
all
officers
and
adjutants
being
admitted
to
his
presence
as
moreover
the
count
kept
an
open
table
every
day
it
made
in
the
house
arranged
only
for
a
family
and
with
but
one
open
staircase
running
from
top
to
bottom
a
movement
and
a
buzzing
like
that
in
a
beehive
although
everything
was
managed
with
moderation
gravity
and
severity
as
mediator
between
the
irritable
master
of
the
house
who
became
daily
more
of
a
hypochondriac
and
his
but
stem
and
precise
military
guest
there
was
a
pleasant
interpreter
a
handsome
corpulent
lively
man
who
was
a
citizen
of
frankfort
spoke
french
well
knew
how
to
adapt
himself
to
everything
and
only
made
a
jest
of
many
little
annoyances
through
him
my
mother
had
sent
a
representation
to
the
count
of
the
situation
in
which
she
was
placed
owing
to
her
husband
state
of
mind
he
had
explained
the
matter
so
skilfully
had
laid
before
him
the
new
and
scarcely
furnished
house
the
natural
reserve
of
the
owner
his
occupation
in
the
education
of
his
family
and
all
that
could
be
said
to
the
same
effect
that
the
count
who
in
his
capacity
took
the
greatest
pride
in
the
utmost
justice
integrity
and
honourable
conduct
resolved
here
also
to
behave
in
an
exemplary
manner
to
those
upon
whom
he
was
quartered
and
indeed
never
swerved
from
this
resolution
under
varying
circumstances
during
the
several
years
he
stayed
with
us
my
mother
possessed
some
knowledge
of
italian
a
language
not
altogether
unknown
to
any
of
the
family
she
therefore
resolved
to
learn
french
immediately
for
which
purpose
the
interpreter
for
whose
child
she
had
stood
godmother
during
these
stormy
times
and
who
now
therefore
as
a
gossip
felt
a
redoubled
interest
in
our
house
devoted
every
spare
moment
to
his
child
godmother
for
he
lived
directly
opposite
and
above
all
he
taught
her
those
phrases
which
she
would
be
obliged
to
use
in
her
personal
intercourse
with
the
count
this
succeeded
admirably
the
count
was
flattered
by
the
pains
taken
by
the
mistress
of
the
house
at
her
years
and
as
he
had
a
cheerful
witty
vein
in
his
character
and
he
liked
to
exhibit
a
certain
dry
gallantry
a
most
friendly
relation
arose
between
them
and
the
allied
godmother
and
father
could
obtain
whatever
they
wanted
from
him
as
i
said
before
if
it
had
been
possible
to
cheer
up
my
father
this
altered
state
of
things
would
have
caused
little
inconvenience
the
count
practised
the
severest
disinterestedness
he
even
declined
receiving
gifts
which
pertained
to
his
situation
the
most
trifling
thing
which
could
have
borne
the
appearance
of
bribery
he
rejected
angrily
and
even
punished
his
people
were
most
strictly
forbidden
to
put
the
proprietor
of
the
house
to
the
least
expense
we
children
on
the
contrary
were
bountifully
supplied
from
the
dessert
to
give
an
idea
of
the
simplicity
of
those
times
i
must
take
this
opportunity
to
mention
that
my
mother
grieved
us
excessively
one
day
by
throwing
away
the
ices
which
had
been
sent
us
from
the
table
because
she
would
not
believe
it
possible
for
the
stomach
to
bear
real
ice
however
it
might
be
sweetened
besides
these
dainties
which
we
gradually
learned
to
enjoy
and
to
digest
with
perfect
ease
it
was
very
agreeable
for
us
children
to
be
in
some
measure
released
from
fixed
hours
of
study
and
strict
discipline
my
father
increased
he
could
not
resign
himself
to
the
unavoidable
how
he
tormented
himself
my
mother
the
interpreter
the
councillors
and
all
his
friends
only
to
rid
him
of
the
count
in
vain
they
represented
to
him
that
under
existing
circumstances
the
presence
of
such
a
man
in
the
house
was
an
actual
benefit
and
that
the
removal
of
the
count
would
be
followed
by
a
constant
succession
of
officers
or
of
privates
none
of
these
arguments
had
any
effect
to
him
the
present
seemed
so
intolerable
that
his
indignation
prevented
his
conceiving
anything
worse
that
could
follow
in
this
way
his
activity
which
he
had
been
used
chiefly
to
employ
upon
us
was
crippled
the
lessons
he
gave
us
were
no
longer
required
with
the
former
exactness
and
we
tried
to
gratify
our
curiosity
for
military
and
other
public
proceedings
as
much
as
possible
not
only
at
home
but
also
in
the
streets
which
was
the
more
easily
done
as
the
front
door
open
day
and
night
was
guarded
by
sentries
who
paid
no
attention
to
the
running
to
and
fro
of
restless
children
the
many
affairs
which
were
settled
before
the
tribunal
of
the
royal
lieutenant
had
quite
a
peculiar
charm
from
his
making
it
a
point
to
accompany
his
decisions
with
some
witty
ingenious
or
lively
turn
what
he
decreed
was
strictly
just
his
manner
of
expressing
it
whimsical
and
piquant
he
seemed
to
have
taken
the
duke
of
ossuna
as
his
model
scarcely
a
day
passed
in
which
the
interpreter
did
not
tell
some
anecdote
or
other
of
this
kind
to
amuse
us
and
my
mother
this
lively
man
had
made
a
little
collection
of
such
selomonian
decisions
but
i
only
remember
the
general
impression
and
can
not
recall
to
my
mind
any
particular
case
by
degrees
we
became
better
acquainted
with
the
strange
character
of
the
count
this
man
clearly
understood
his
own
peculiarities
and
as
there
were
times
in
which
he
was
seized
with
a
sort
of
dejection
hypochondria
or
by
whatever
name
we
may
call
the
evil
demon
he
withdrew
into
his
room
at
such
hours
which
were
often
lengthened
into
days
saw
no
one
but
his
valet
and
in
urgent
cases
could
not
even
be
prevailed
upon
to
receive
any
one
but
as
soon
as
the
evil
spirit
had
left
him
he
appeared
as
before
active
mild
and
cheerful
it
might
be
inferred
from
the
talk
of
his
valet
saint
jean
a
small
thin
man
of
lively
that
in
his
earlier
years
he
had
caused
a
great
misfortune
when
overcome
by
this
temper
and
that
therefore
in
so
important
a
position
as
his
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
he
had
earnestly
resolved
to
avoid
similar
aberrations
the
frankfort
painters
during
the
very
first
days
of
the
count
residence
with
us
all
the
frankfort
artists
as
hirt
schütz
trautmann
nothnagel
and
junker
were
called
to
him
they
showed
their
finished
pictures
and
the
count
bought
what
were
for
sale
my
pretty
light
room
in
the
of
the
attic
was
given
up
to
him
and
immediately
turned
into
a
cabinet
and
studio
for
he
designed
to
keep
all
the
artists
at
work
for
a
long
time
especially
seekatz
of
darmstadt
whose
pencil
particularly
in
simple
and
natural
representations
highly
pleased
him
he
therefore
caused
to
be
sent
from
grasse
where
his
elder
brother
possessed
a
handsome
house
the
dimensions
of
all
the
rooms
and
cabinets
then
considered
with
the
artists
the
divisions
of
the
walls
and
fixed
accordingly
upon
the
size
of
the
large
which
were
not
to
be
set
in
frames
but
to
be
fastened
upon
the
walls
like
pieces
of
tapestry
and
now
the
work
went
on
zealously
seekatz
undertook
country
scenes
and
succeeded
extremely
well
in
his
old
people
and
children
which
were
copied
directly
from
nature
his
young
men
did
not
answer
so
well
they
were
almost
all
too
thin
and
his
women
failed
from
the
opposite
cause
for
as
he
had
a
little
fat
good
but
wife
who
would
let
him
have
no
model
but
herself
he
could
produce
nothing
agreeable
he
was
also
obliged
to
exceed
the
usual
size
of
his
figures
his
trees
had
truth
but
the
foliage
was
over
minute
he
was
a
pupil
of
brinkmann
whose
pencil
in
easel
pictures
is
not
contemptible
schütz
the
landscape
painter
had
perhaps
the
best
of
the
matter
he
was
thoroughly
master
of
the
rhine
country
and
of
the
sunny
tone
which
animates
it
in
the
fine
season
nor
was
he
entirely
unaccustomed
to
work
on
a
larger
scale
and
then
he
showed
no
want
of
execution
or
keeping
his
paintings
were
of
a
cheerful
cast
trautmann
some
out
of
the
new
testament
and
alongside
of
them
set
fire
to
villages
and
mills
one
cabinet
was
entirely
allotted
to
him
as
i
found
from
the
designs
of
the
rooms
hirt
painted
some
good
oak
and
beech
forests
his
cattle
were
praiseworthy
junker
accustomed
to
the
imitation
of
the
most
elaborate
dutch
was
least
able
to
manage
this
but
he
condescended
to
ornament
many
compartments
with
flowers
and
fruits
for
a
handsome
price
as
i
had
known
all
these
men
from
my
earliest
youth
and
had
often
visited
them
in
their
studios
and
as
the
count
also
liked
to
have
me
with
him
i
was
present
at
the
suggestions
consultations
and
orders
as
well
as
at
the
deliveries
of
the
pictures
and
ventured
to
speak
my
opinion
freely
when
sketches
and
designs
were
handed
in
i
bad
already
gained
among
amateurs
particularly
at
auctions
which
i
attended
diligently
the
reputation
of
being
able
to
tell
at
once
what
any
historical
picture
represented
whether
taken
from
biblical
or
profane
history
or
from
mythology
and
even
if
i
did
not
always
hit
upon
the
meaning
of
allegorical
pictures
there
was
seldom
any
one
present
who
understood
it
better
than
i
often
had
i
persuaded
the
artists
to
represent
this
or
that
subject
and
i
now
joyfully
made
use
of
these
advantages
i
still
remember
writing
a
circumstantial
essay
in
which
i
described
twelve
pictures
which
were
to
exhibit
the
history
of
joseph
some
of
them
were
executed
after
these
achievements
which
were
certainly
laudable
in
a
boy
i
will
mention
a
little
disgrace
which
happened
to
me
within
this
circle
of
artists
i
was
well
acquainted
with
all
the
pictures
which
had
been
from
time
to
time
brought
into
that
room
my
youthful
curiosity
left
nothing
unseen
or
unexplored
i
once
found
a
little
black
box
behind
the
stove
i
did
not
fail
to
investigate
what
might
be
concealed
in
it
and
drew
back
the
bolt
without
long
deliberation
the
picture
contained
was
certainly
of
a
kind
not
usually
exposed
to
view
and
although
i
tried
to
bolt
it
again
immediately
i
was
not
quick
enough
the
count
entered
and
caught
me
who
allowed
you
to
open
that
box
he
asked
with
all
his
air
of
a
royal
lieutenant
i
had
not
much
to
say
for
myself
and
he
immediately
pronounced
my
sentence
in
a
very
stern
manner
for
eight
days
said
he
you
shall
not
enter
this
room
i
made
a
bow
and
walked
out
even
this
order
i
obeyed
most
punctually
so
that
the
good
seekatz
who
was
then
at
work
in
the
room
was
very
much
annoyed
for
he
liked
to
have
mo
about
him
and
out
of
a
little
spite
i
carried
my
obedience
so
far
that
i
left
seekatz
coffee
which
i
generally
brought
him
upon
the
threshold
he
was
then
obliged
to
leave
his
work
and
fetch
it
which
he
took
so
ill
that
he
almost
conceived
a
dislike
to
me
french
theatre
it
now
seems
necessary
to
state
more
circumstantially
and
to
make
intelligible
how
under
these
circumstances
i
made
my
way
with
more
or
less
ease
through
the
french
language
which
however
i
had
never
learned
here
too
my
natural
gift
was
of
service
to
me
enabling
me
easily
to
catch
the
sound
of
a
language
its
movement
accent
tone
and
all
other
outward
peculiarities
i
knew
many
words
from
the
latin
italian
suggested
still
more
and
by
listening
to
servants
and
soldiers
sentries
and
visitors
i
soon
picked
up
so
much
that
if
i
could
not
join
in
conversation
i
could
at
any
rate
manage
single
questions
and
answers
all
this
however
was
little
compared
to
the
profit
i
derived
from
the
theatre
my
grandfather
had
given
me
a
free
ticket
which
i
used
daily
in
spite
of
my
father
reluctance
by
dint
of
my
mother
support
there
i
sat
in
the
pit
before
a
foreign
stage
and
watched
the
more
narrowly
the
movement
and
the
expression
both
of
gesture
and
speech
as
i
understood
little
or
nothing
of
what
was
said
and
therefore
could
only
derive
entertainment
from
the
action
and
the
tone
of
voice
i
understood
least
of
comedy
because
it
was
spoken
rapidly
and
related
to
the
affairs
of
common
life
of
the
phrases
of
which
i
knew
nothing
tragedy
was
not
so
often
played
and
the
measured
step
the
rhythm
of
the
alexandrines
the
generality
of
the
expression
made
it
more
intelligible
to
me
in
every
way
it
was
not
long
before
i
took
up
racine
which
i
found
in
my
father
library
and
declaimed
the
pieces
to
myself
in
the
theatrical
style
and
manner
as
the
organ
of
my
ear
and
the
organ
of
speech
so
nearly
akin
to
that
had
caught
it
and
this
with
considerable
animation
although
i
could
not
perceive
the
connexion
of
a
whole
speech
i
even
learned
entire
passages
by
rote
like
a
trained
which
was
easier
to
me
from
having
previously
committed
to
memory
passages
from
the
bible
which
are
generally
unintelligible
to
a
child
and
accustomed
myself
to
reciting
them
in
the
tone
of
the
protestant
preachers
the
versified
french
comedy
was
then
much
in
vogue
the
pieces
of
destouches
marivaux
and
la
chaise
were
often
produced
and
i
still
remember
distinctly
many
characteristic
figures
of
those
of
molière
i
recollect
less
what
made
the
greatest
impression
upon
me
was
the
of
lemière
which
as
a
new
piece
was
brought
out
with
care
and
often
repeated
the
du
village
rose
et
colas
annette
made
each
a
very
pleasant
impression
upon
me
i
can
even
now
recall
the
youths
and
maidens
decorated
with
ribands
and
their
gestures
it
was
not
long
before
the
wish
arose
in
me
to
see
the
interior
of
the
theatre
for
which
many
opportunities
were
offered
me
for
as
i
had
not
always
patience
to
hear
out
the
whole
pieces
and
often
carried
on
all
sorts
of
games
with
other
children
of
my
age
in
the
corridors
and
in
the
milder
season
even
before
the
door
a
handsome
lively
boy
joined
us
who
belonged
to
the
theatre
and
whom
i
had
seen
in
many
little
parts
though
only
casually
he
came
to
a
better
understanding
with
me
than
with
the
rest
as
i
could
turn
my
french
to
account
with
him
and
he
the
more
attached
himself
to
me
because
there
was
no
boy
of
his
age
or
his
nation
at
the
theatre
or
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
we
also
went
together
at
other
times
as
well
as
during
the
play
and
even
while
the
representations
went
on
he
seldom
left
me
in
peace
he
was
a
most
delightful
little
braggart
chattered
away
charmingly
and
incessantly
and
could
tell
so
much
of
his
adventures
quarrels
and
other
strange
incidents
that
he
amused
me
wonderfully
and
i
learned
from
him
in
four
weeks
more
of
the
language
and
of
the
power
of
expressing
myself
in
it
than
can
be
imagined
so
that
no
one
knew
how
i
had
attained
the
foreign
tongue
all
at
once
as
if
by
inspiration
in
the
very
earliest
days
of
our
acquaintance
he
took
me
with
him
upon
the
stage
and
led
me
especially
to
the
where
the
actors
and
actresses
remained
during
the
intervals
of
the
performance
and
dressed
and
undressed
the
place
was
neither
convenient
nor
agreeable
for
they
had
squeezed
the
theatre
into
a
so
that
there
were
no
separate
chambers
for
the
actors
behind
the
stage
a
tolerably
large
room
adjoining
which
had
formerly
served
for
was
now
mostly
used
by
both
sexes
in
common
who
appeared
to
feel
as
little
ashamed
before
each
other
as
before
us
children
if
there
was
not
always
the
strictest
propriety
in
putting
on
or
changing
the
articles
of
dress
i
had
never
seen
anything
of
the
kind
before
and
yet
from
habit
after
repeated
visits
i
soon
found
it
quite
natural
derones
and
his
sister
it
was
not
long
before
a
very
peculiar
interest
of
my
own
arose
young
derones
for
so
i
will
call
the
boy
whose
acquaintance
i
still
kept
up
was
with
the
exception
of
his
boasting
a
youth
of
good
manners
and
very
courteous
demeanour
he
made
me
acquainted
with
his
sister
a
girl
who
was
a
few
years
older
than
we
were
and
a
very
pleasant
girl
of
regular
form
brown
complexion
black
hair
and
eyes
her
whole
deportment
had
about
it
something
quiet
even
sad
i
tried
to
make
myself
agreeable
to
her
in
every
way
but
i
could
not
attract
her
notice
young
girls
think
themselves
far
advanced
beyond
younger
boys
and
while
aspiring
to
young
men
they
assume
the
manner
of
an
aunt
towards
the
boy
whose
first
inclination
is
turned
towards
with
a
younger
brother
of
his
i
had
no
acquaintance
often
when
their
mother
had
gone
to
rehearsals
or
was
out
visiting
we
met
at
her
house
to
play
and
amuse
ourselves
i
never
went
there
without
presenting
the
fair
one
with
a
flower
a
fruit
or
something
else
which
she
always
received
very
courteously
and
thanked
me
for
most
politely
but
i
never
saw
her
sad
look
brighten
and
found
no
trace
of
her
having
given
me
a
further
thought
at
last
i
fancied
i
had
discovered
her
secret
the
boy
showed
me
a
of
a
handsome
man
behind
his
mother
bed
which
was
hung
with
elegant
silk
curtains
remarking
at
the
same
time
with
a
sly
look
that
this
was
not
papa
but
just
the
same
as
papa
and
as
he
glorified
this
man
and
told
me
many
things
in
his
circumstantial
and
ostentatious
manner
i
thought
i
had
discovered
that
the
daughter
might
belong
to
the
father
but
the
other
two
children
to
the
intimate
friend
i
thus
explained
to
myself
her
melancholy
look
and
loved
her
for
it
all
the
more
my
liking
for
this
girl
assisted
me
in
bearing
the
extravagances
of
her
brother
who
was
not
always
within
bounds
i
had
often
to
endure
prolix
accounts
of
his
exploits
how
he
had
already
often
fought
without
wishing
to
injure
the
other
all
for
the
mere
sake
of
honour
he
had
always
contrived
to
disarm
his
adversary
and
had
then
forgiven
him
nay
he
was
such
a
good
fencer
that
he
was
once
very
much
perplexed
by
striking
the
sword
of
his
opponent
up
into
a
high
tree
so
that
it
was
not
easy
to
be
got
again
what
much
facilitated
my
visits
to
the
theatre
was
that
my
free
ticket
coming
from
the
hands
of
the
gave
me
access
to
any
of
the
seats
and
therefore
also
to
those
in
the
proscenium
this
was
very
deep
after
the
french
style
and
was
bordered
on
both
sides
with
seats
which
surrounded
by
a
low
rail
ascended
in
several
rows
one
behind
another
so
that
the
first
seats
were
but
a
little
elevated
above
the
stage
the
whole
was
considered
a
place
of
special
honour
and
was
generally
used
only
by
officers
although
the
nearness
of
the
actors
destroyed
i
will
not
say
all
illusion
but
in
a
measure
all
enjoyment
i
have
thus
experienced
and
seen
with
my
own
eyes
the
usage
or
abuse
of
which
voltaire
so
much
complains
if
when
the
house
was
very
full
at
such
time
as
troops
were
passing
through
the
town
officers
of
distinction
strove
for
this
place
of
honour
which
was
generally
occupied
already
some
rows
of
benches
and
chairs
were
placed
in
the
proscenium
on
the
stage
itself
and
nothing
remained
for
the
heroes
and
heroines
but
to
reveal
their
secrets
in
the
very
limited
space
between
the
uniforms
and
orders
i
have
even
seen
the
performed
under
such
circumstances
the
curtain
did
not
fall
between
the
acts
and
i
must
yet
mention
a
strange
custom
which
i
thought
quite
extraordinary
as
its
inconsistency
with
art
was
to
me
as
a
good
german
boy
quite
unendurable
the
theatre
was
considered
the
greatest
sanctuary
and
any
disturbance
occurring
there
would
have
been
instantly
resented
as
the
highest
crime
against
the
majesty
of
the
public
therefore
in
all
comedies
two
grenadiers
stood
with
their
arms
grounded
in
full
view
at
the
two
sides
of
the
back
scene
and
were
witnesses
of
all
that
occurred
in
the
bosom
of
the
family
since
as
i
said
before
the
curtain
did
not
fall
between
the
acts
two
others
while
music
struck
up
relieved
guard
by
coming
from
the
wings
directly
in
front
of
the
first
who
retired
in
the
same
measured
manner
now
if
such
a
practice
was
well
fitted
to
destroy
all
that
in
the
theatre
is
called
illusion
this
is
the
more
striking
because
it
was
done
at
a
time
when
according
to
diderot
principles
and
examples
the
most
was
required
upon
the
stage
and
a
perfect
deception
was
proposed
as
the
proper
aim
of
theatrical
art
tragedy
however
was
absolved
from
any
such
regulations
and
the
heroes
of
antiquity
had
the
right
of
guarding
themselves
nevertheless
the
same
grenadiers
stood
near
enough
behind
the
i
will
also
mention
that
i
saw
diderot
father
of
a
family
and
the
philosophers
of
palissot
and
still
perfectly
remember
the
figure
of
the
philosopher
in
the
latter
piece
going
upon
all
fours
and
biting
into
a
raw
head
of
lettuce
duel
with
derones
all
this
theatrical
variety
could
not
however
keep
us
children
always
in
the
theatre
in
fine
weather
we
played
in
front
of
it
and
in
the
neighbourhood
and
committed
all
manner
of
absurdities
which
especially
on
sundays
and
festivals
by
no
means
corresponded
to
our
personal
appearance
for
i
and
my
comrades
then
appeared
dressed
as
i
described
myself
in
the
tale
with
the
hat
under
the
arm
and
a
little
sword
the
hilt
of
which
was
ornamented
with
a
large
silk
knot
one
day
when
we
had
long
gone
in
this
way
and
derones
had
joined
us
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
assert
to
me
that
i
had
insulted
him
and
must
give
him
satisfaction
i
could
not
in
truth
conceive
what
was
the
cause
of
this
but
i
accepted
his
challenge
and
was
going
to
draw
my
sword
however
he
assured
me
that
in
such
cases
it
was
customary
to
go
to
secluded
spots
in
order
to
be
able
to
settle
the
matter
more
conveniently
we
therefore
went
behind
some
barns
and
placed
ourselves
in
the
proper
position
the
duel
took
place
in
a
somewhat
theatrical
style
the
blades
clashed
and
the
thrusts
followed
close
upon
each
other
but
in
the
heat
of
the
combat
he
remained
with
the
point
of
his
sword
lodged
in
the
knot
of
my
hilt
this
was
pierced
through
and
he
assured
me
that
he
had
received
the
most
complete
satisfaction
then
embraced
me
also
theatrically
and
we
went
to
the
next
to
refresh
ourselves
with
a
glass
of
after
our
mental
agitation
and
to
knit
more
closely
the
old
bond
of
friendship
on
this
occasion
i
will
relate
another
adventure
which
also
happened
to
me
at
the
theatre
although
at
a
later
time
i
was
sitting
very
quietly
in
the
pit
with
one
of
my
playmates
and
we
looked
with
pleasure
at
a
which
was
executed
with
much
skill
and
grace
by
a
pretty
boy
about
our
own
age
the
son
of
a
french
who
was
passing
through
the
city
after
the
fashion
of
dancers
he
was
dressed
in
a
close
vest
of
red
silk
which
ending
in
a
short
like
a
runner
apron
floated
above
the
knee
we
had
given
our
meed
of
applause
to
this
young
artist
with
the
whole
public
when
i
know
not
how
it
occurred
to
me
to
make
a
moral
reflection
i
said
to
my
companion
how
handsomely
this
boy
was
dressed
and
how
well
he
looked
who
knows
in
how
tattered
a
jacket
he
may
sleep
all
had
already
risen
but
the
crowd
prevented
our
moving
a
woman
who
had
sat
by
me
and
who
was
now
standing
close
beside
me
chanced
to
be
the
mother
of
the
young
artist
and
felt
much
offended
by
my
reflection
unfortunately
she
knew
german
enough
to
understand
me
and
spoke
it
just
as
much
as
was
necessary
to
scold
she
abused
me
violently
who
was
i
she
would
like
to
know
that
had
a
right
to
doubt
the
family
and
respectability
of
this
young
man
at
all
events
she
would
be
bound
he
was
as
good
as
i
and
his
talents
might
probably
procure
him
a
fortune
of
which
i
could
not
even
venture
to
dream
this
moral
lecture
she
read
me
in
the
crowd
and
made
those
about
me
wonder
what
rudeness
i
had
committed
as
i
could
neither
excuse
myself
nor
escape
from
her
i
was
really
embarrassed
and
when
she
paused
for
a
moment
said
without
thinking
well
why
do
you
make
such
a
noise
about
it
red
dead
these
words
seemed
to
strike
the
woman
dumb
she
stared
at
me
and
moved
away
from
me
as
soon
as
it
was
in
any
degree
possible
i
thought
no
more
of
my
words
only
some
time
afterwards
they
occurred
to
me
when
the
boy
instead
of
continuing
to
perform
became
ill
and
that
very
dangerously
whether
he
died
or
not
i
can
not
say
such
intimations
by
an
unseasonably
or
even
improperly
spoken
word
were
held
in
repute
even
by
the
ancients
and
it
is
very
remarkable
that
the
forms
of
belief
and
of
superstition
have
always
remained
the
same
among
all
people
and
in
all
times
from
the
first
day
of
the
occupation
of
our
city
there
was
no
lack
of
constant
diversion
especially
for
children
and
young
people
plays
and
balls
parades
and
marches
through
the
town
attracted
our
attention
in
all
directions
the
last
particularly
were
always
increasing
and
the
soldiers
life
seemed
to
us
very
merry
and
agreeable
marshal
de
broglio
the
residence
of
the
king
lieutenant
at
our
house
procured
us
the
advantage
of
seeing
by
degrees
all
the
distinguished
persons
in
the
french
army
and
especially
of
beholding
close
at
hand
the
leaders
whose
names
had
already
been
made
known
to
us
by
reputation
thus
we
looked
from
stairs
and
as
if
from
galleries
very
conveniently
upon
the
generals
who
passed
by
before
all
i
remember
the
prince
soubise
as
a
handsome
courteous
gentleman
but
most
distinctly
the
marechal
de
broglio
who
was
a
younger
man
not
tall
but
lively
active
and
abounding
in
keen
glances
he
often
came
to
the
king
lieutenant
and
it
was
soon
remarked
that
the
conversation
was
on
weighty
matters
we
had
scarcely
become
accustomed
to
having
strangers
quartered
upon
us
in
the
first
three
months
when
a
rumour
was
obscurely
circulated
that
the
allies
were
on
the
march
and
that
duke
ferdinand
of
brunswick
was
coming
to
drive
the
french
from
the
maine
of
these
who
could
not
boast
of
any
especial
success
in
war
no
high
opinion
was
held
and
after
the
battle
of
rossbach
it
was
thought
they
might
be
dispersed
the
greatest
confidence
was
placed
in
duke
ferdinand
and
all
those
favourable
to
prussia
awaited
with
eagerness
their
delivery
from
the
yoke
hitherto
borne
my
father
was
in
somewhat
better
spirits
my
mother
was
apprehensive
she
was
wise
enough
to
see
that
a
small
present
evil
might
easily
be
exchanged
for
a
great
affliction
since
it
was
but
too
plain
that
the
french
would
not
advance
to
meet
the
duke
but
would
wait
an
attack
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
city
a
defeat
of
the
french
a
flight
a
defence
of
the
city
if
it
were
only
to
cover
their
rear
and
hold
the
bridge
a
bombardment
a
sack
all
these
presented
themselves
to
the
excited
imagination
and
gave
anxiety
to
both
parties
my
mother
who
could
bear
everything
but
suspense
imparted
her
fears
to
the
count
through
the
interpreter
she
received
the
answer
usual
in
such
cases
she
might
be
quite
easy
for
there
was
nothing
to
fear
and
should
keep
quiet
and
mention
the
matter
to
no
one
many
troops
passed
through
the
city
we
learned
that
they
halted
at
bergen
the
coming
and
going
the
riding
and
running
constantly
increased
and
our
house
was
in
an
uproar
day
and
night
at
this
time
i
often
saw
marshal
de
broglio
always
cheerful
always
the
same
in
look
and
manner
and
i
was
afterwards
pleased
to
find
a
man
whose
form
had
made
such
a
good
and
lasting
impression
upon
me
so
honourably
mentioned
in
history
thus
after
an
unquiet
the
of
arrived
a
profound
stillness
announced
the
approaching
storm
we
children
were
forbidden
to
quit
the
house
my
father
had
no
quiet
and
went
out
the
battle
began
i
ascended
to
the
garret
where
indeed
i
was
prevented
seeing
the
country
round
but
could
very
well
hear
the
thunder
of
cannon
and
the
general
discharge
of
musketry
after
some
hours
we
saw
the
first
symptoms
of
the
battle
in
a
line
of
wagons
in
which
the
wounded
with
various
sad
mutilations
and
gestures
were
slowly
drawn
by
us
to
be
taken
to
the
convent
of
mary
now
transformed
into
a
hospital
the
compassion
of
the
citizens
was
instantly
moved
beer
wine
bread
and
money
were
distributed
to
those
who
were
yet
able
to
take
them
but
when
some
time
after
wounded
and
captive
germans
were
seen
in
the
train
the
pity
knew
no
limits
and
it
seemed
as
if
everybody
would
strip
himself
of
every
moveable
that
he
possessed
to
assist
his
suffering
countrymen
the
prisoners
however
were
an
evidence
of
a
battle
unfavourable
to
the
allies
my
father
whose
party
feelings
made
him
quite
certain
that
these
would
come
off
victorious
had
the
violent
temerity
to
go
forth
to
meet
the
expected
victors
without
thinking
that
the
beaten
party
must
pass
over
him
in
their
flight
he
first
repaired
to
his
garden
before
the
friedberg
gate
where
he
found
everything
lonely
and
quiet
then
he
ventured
to
the
bernheim
heath
where
he
soon
descried
various
stragglers
of
the
army
who
were
scattered
and
amused
themselves
by
shooting
at
the
so
that
the
rebounding
lead
whizzed
round
the
head
of
the
inquisitive
wanderer
he
therefore
considered
it
more
prudent
to
go
back
and
learned
on
enquiry
what
the
report
of
the
firing
might
have
before
informed
him
that
all
stood
well
for
the
french
and
that
there
was
no
thought
of
retreating
reaching
home
in
an
the
sight
of
his
wounded
and
captured
countrymen
brought
him
altogether
out
of
his
usual
he
also
caused
various
donations
to
be
given
to
the
passers
by
but
only
the
germans
were
to
have
them
which
was
not
always
possible
as
fate
had
packed
together
both
friend
and
foe
my
mother
and
we
children
who
had
already
relied
on
the
count
word
and
had
therefore
passed
a
tolerably
quiet
day
were
highly
rejoiced
and
my
mother
doubly
consoled
the
next
day
when
having
consulted
the
oracle
of
her
by
the
prick
of
a
needle
she
received
a
very
comfortable
answer
both
for
present
and
future
we
wished
our
father
similar
faith
and
feelings
we
flattered
him
as
much
as
we
could
we
entreated
him
to
take
some
food
from
which
he
had
abstained
all
day
but
he
repulsed
our
caresses
and
every
enjoyment
and
betook
himself
to
his
chamber
our
joy
however
was
not
interrupted
the
affair
was
decided
the
king
lieutenant
who
against
his
habit
had
been
on
horseback
at
last
returned
home
where
his
presence
was
more
necessary
than
ever
we
sprang
to
meet
him
kissed
his
hands
and
testified
our
delight
this
seemed
much
to
please
him
well
said
he
more
kindly
than
usual
i
am
glad
also
for
your
sakes
my
dear
children
he
immediately
ordered
that
sweetmeats
sweet
wine
and
the
best
of
everything
should
be
given
us
and
went
to
his
room
already
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
the
urgent
the
demanding
and
the
suppliant
quarrel
with
count
thorane
we
had
now
a
fine
collation
pitied
our
poor
father
who
would
not
partake
of
it
and
pressed
our
mother
to
call
him
in
but
she
more
prudent
than
we
well
knew
how
distasteful
such
gifts
would
be
to
him
in
the
meantime
she
had
prepared
some
supper
and
would
readily
have
sent
a
portion
up
to
his
room
but
he
never
tolerated
such
an
irregularity
even
in
the
most
extreme
cases
and
after
the
sweet
things
were
removed
we
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
come
down
into
the
ordinary
at
last
he
allowed
himself
to
be
persuaded
unwillingly
and
we
had
no
notion
of
the
mischief
which
we
were
preparing
for
him
and
ourselves
the
staircase
ran
through
the
whole
house
along
all
the
my
father
in
coming
down
had
to
go
directly
past
the
count
apartment
this
was
so
full
of
people
that
the
count
to
get
through
much
at
once
resolved
to
come
out
and
this
happened
unfortunately
at
the
moment
when
my
father
descended
the
count
met
him
cheerfully
greeted
him
and
remarked
you
will
congratulate
yourselves
and
us
that
this
dangerous
affair
is
so
happily
terminated
by
no
means
replied
my
father
in
a
rage
would
that
it
had
driven
you
to
the
devil
even
if
i
had
gone
with
you
the
count
restrained
himself
for
a
moment
and
then
broke
out
with
wrath
you
shall
pay
for
this
cried
he
you
shall
find
that
you
have
not
thus
insulted
the
good
cause
and
myself
for
nothing
my
father
meanwhile
came
down
very
calmly
seated
himself
near
us
seemed
more
cheerful
than
before
and
began
to
eat
we
were
glad
of
this
unconscious
of
the
dangerous
method
in
which
he
had
rolled
the
stone
from
his
heart
soon
afterwards
my
mother
was
called
out
and
we
had
great
pleasure
in
chattering
to
our
father
about
the
sweet
things
the
count
had
given
us
our
mother
did
not
return
at
last
the
interpreter
came
in
at
a
hint
from
him
we
were
sent
to
bed
it
was
already
late
and
we
willingly
obeyed
after
a
night
quietly
slept
through
we
heard
of
the
violent
commotion
which
had
shaken
the
house
the
previous
evening
the
king
lieutenant
had
instantly
ordered
my
father
to
be
led
to
the
the
subalterns
well
knew
that
he
was
never
to
be
contradicted
yet
they
had
often
earned
thanks
by
delaying
the
execution
of
his
orders
the
interpreter
whose
presence
of
mind
never
forsook
him
contrived
to
excite
this
disposition
in
them
very
strongly
the
tumult
moreover
was
so
great
that
a
delay
brought
with
it
its
own
concealment
and
excuse
he
had
called
out
my
mother
and
put
the
adjutant
as
it
were
into
her
hands
that
by
prayers
and
representations
she
might
gain
a
brief
postponement
of
the
matter
he
himself
hurried
up
to
the
count
who
with
great
had
immediately
retired
into
the
inner
room
and
would
rather
allow
the
most
urgent
affair
to
stand
still
than
wreak
on
an
innocent
person
the
once
excited
in
him
and
give
a
decision
derogatory
to
his
dignity
the
address
of
the
interpreter
to
the
count
the
train
of
the
whole
conversation
were
often
enough
repeated
to
us
by
the
fat
interpreter
who
prided
himself
not
a
little
on
the
fortunate
result
so
that
i
can
still
describe
it
from
recollection
the
gossip
and
count
thorane
the
interpreter
had
ventured
to
open
the
cabinet
and
enter
an
act
which
was
severely
prohibited
what
do
you
want
shouted
the
count
angrily
out
with
you
no
one
but
jean
has
a
right
to
enter
here
well
suppose
i
am
jean
for
a
moment
answered
the
interpreter
it
would
need
a
powerful
imagination
for
that
two
of
him
would
not
make
one
such
as
you
retire
count
you
have
received
a
great
gift
from
heaven
and
to
that
i
appeal
you
think
to
flatter
me
do
not
fancy
you
will
succeed
you
have
the
great
gift
count
even
in
moments
of
passion
in
moments
of
rage
of
listening
to
the
opinions
of
others
well
well
the
question
now
is
just
about
opinions
to
which
i
have
listened
too
long
i
know
but
too
well
that
we
are
not
liked
here
and
that
these
citizens
look
askance
at
us
not
all
very
many
what
these
towns
will
be
imperial
towns
will
they
they
saw
their
emperor
elected
and
crowned
and
when
being
unjustly
attacked
he
is
in
danger
of
losing
his
dominions
and
surrendering
to
an
usurper
when
he
fortunately
finds
faithful
allies
who
pour
out
their
blood
and
treasure
in
his
behalf
they
will
not
put
up
with
the
slight
burden
that
falls
to
their
share
towards
humbling
the
enemy
but
you
have
long
known
these
sentiments
and
have
endured
them
like
a
wise
man
they
are
besides
held
only
by
a
minority
a
few
dazzled
by
the
splendid
qualities
of
the
enemy
whom
you
yourself
prize
as
an
extraordinary
man
a
few
only
as
you
are
aware
yes
indeed
i
have
known
and
suffered
it
too
long
otherwise
this
man
would
not
have
presumed
to
utter
such
insults
to
my
face
and
at
the
most
critical
moment
let
them
be
as
many
as
they
please
they
shall
be
punished
in
the
person
of
this
their
audacious
representative
and
perceive
what
they
have
to
expect
only
delay
count
in
certain
things
one
can
not
act
too
promptly
only
a
little
delay
count
neighbour
you
think
to
mislead
me
into
a
false
step
you
shall
not
succeed
i
would
neither
lead
you
into
a
false
step
nor
restrain
you
from
one
your
resolution
is
just
it
becomes
the
frenchman
and
the
lieutenant
but
consider
that
you
are
also
count
thorane
he
has
no
right
to
interfere
here
but
the
gallant
man
has
a
right
to
be
heard
what
would
he
say
then
king
lieutenant
he
would
begin
you
have
so
long
had
patience
with
so
many
gloomy
untoward
bungling
men
if
they
were
not
really
too
bad
this
man
has
certainly
been
too
bad
but
control
yourself
king
lieutenant
and
every
one
will
praise
and
extol
you
on
that
account
you
know
i
can
often
endure
your
jests
but
do
not
abuse
my
these
men
are
they
then
completely
blinded
suppose
we
had
lost
the
battle
what
would
have
been
their
fate
at
this
moment
we
fight
up
to
the
gates
we
shut
up
the
city
we
halt
we
defend
ourselves
to
cover
our
retreat
over
the
bridge
think
you
the
enemy
would
have
stood
with
his
hands
before
him
he
throws
grenades
and
what
he
has
at
hand
and
they
catch
where
they
can
this
what
would
he
have
hero
in
these
rooms
a
bomb
might
now
have
burst
and
another
have
followed
it
in
these
rooms
the
cursed
of
which
i
have
spared
incommoding
myself
by
not
nailing
up
my
maps
they
ought
to
have
spent
the
whole
day
on
their
knees
how
many
would
have
done
that
they
ought
to
have
prayed
for
a
blessing
on
us
and
to
have
gone
out
to
meet
the
generals
and
officers
with
tokens
of
honour
and
joy
and
the
wearied
soldiers
with
refreshments
instead
of
this
the
poison
of
destroys
the
fairest
and
happiest
moments
of
my
life
won
by
so
many
cares
and
efforts
it
is
but
you
will
only
increase
it
by
the
punishment
of
this
man
those
who
think
with
him
will
proclaim
you
a
tyrant
and
a
barbarian
they
will
consider
him
a
martyr
who
has
suffered
for
the
good
cause
and
even
those
of
the
other
opinion
who
are
now
his
opponents
will
see
in
him
only
their
will
pity
him
and
while
they
confess
your
justice
will
yet
feel
that
you
have
proceeded
too
severely
i
have
listened
to
you
too
much
already
now
away
with
you
hear
only
this
remember
this
is
the
most
thing
that
could
befall
this
man
this
family
you
have
had
no
reason
to
be
edified
by
the
of
the
master
of
the
house
but
the
mistress
has
anticipated
all
your
wishes
and
the
children
have
regarded
you
as
their
undo
with
this
single
blow
you
will
for
ever
destroy
the
peace
and
happiness
of
this
dwelling
indeed
i
may
say
that
a
bomb
falling
into
the
house
would
not
have
occasioned
greater
desolation
i
have
so
often
admired
your
count
give
me
this
time
opportunity
to
adore
you
a
warrior
is
worthy
of
honour
who
considers
himself
a
guest
in
the
house
of
an
enemy
but
here
there
is
no
enemy
only
a
mistaking
man
control
yourself
and
you
will
acquire
an
everlasting
fame
that
would
be
odd
replied
the
count
with
a
smile
merely
natural
continued
the
interpreter
i
have
not
sent
the
wife
and
children
to
your
feet
because
i
know
you
detest
such
scenes
but
i
will
depict
to
you
this
wife
and
these
children
how
they
will
thank
you
i
will
depict
them
to
you
conversing
all
their
lives
of
the
battle
of
bergen
and
of
your
magnanimity
on
this
day
relating
it
to
their
children
and
children
children
and
inspiring
even
strangers
with
their
own
interest
for
you
an
act
of
this
kind
can
never
perish
but
you
do
not
hit
my
weak
side
yet
interpreter
about
posthumous
fame
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
thinking
that
is
for
others
not
for
me
but
to
do
right
at
the
moment
not
to
neglect
my
duty
not
to
prejudice
my
honour
that
is
my
care
we
have
already
had
too
many
words
now
go
and
receive
the
thanks
of
the
thankless
whom
i
spare
thorane
magnanimity
the
interpreter
surprised
and
moved
by
this
unexpectedly
favourable
issue
could
not
restrain
his
tears
and
would
have
kissed
the
hands
the
count
motioned
him
off
and
said
severely
and
seriously
you
know
i
can
not
bear
such
things
and
with
these
words
he
went
into
the
to
attend
to
his
pressing
affairs
and
hear
the
claims
of
so
many
expectant
persons
so
the
matter
was
disposed
of
and
the
next
morning
we
celebrated
with
the
remnants
of
the
sweetmeats
the
passing
over
of
an
evil
through
the
threatenings
of
which
we
had
happily
slept
whether
the
interpreter
really
spoke
so
wisely
or
merely
so
painted
the
scene
to
himself
as
one
is
apt
to
do
after
a
good
and
fortunate
action
i
will
not
decide
at
least
he
never
varied
it
in
repeating
it
indeed
this
day
seemed
to
him
both
the
most
anxious
and
the
most
glorious
in
his
life
one
little
incident
will
show
how
the
count
in
general
rejected
all
false
parade
never
assumed
a
title
which
did
not
belong
to
him
and
how
witty
he
was
in
his
more
cheerful
moods
a
man
of
the
higher
class
who
was
one
of
the
abstruse
solitary
frankforters
thought
he
must
complain
of
the
quartering
of
the
soldiers
upon
him
he
came
in
person
and
the
interpreter
proffered
him
his
services
but
the
other
supposed
that
he
did
not
need
them
he
came
before
the
count
with
a
most
becoming
bow
and
said
your
excellency
the
count
returned
the
bow
as
the
excellency
struck
by
this
mark
of
honour
and
not
supposing
but
that
the
title
was
too
humble
he
stooped
lower
and
said
monseigneur
sir
said
the
count
very
seriously
we
will
not
go
further
or
else
we
may
easily
bring
it
to
majesty
the
ether
gentleman
was
extremely
confused
and
had
not
a
word
to
utter
the
interpreter
standing
at
some
distance
and
apprised
of
the
whole
affair
was
wicked
enough
not
to
move
but
the
count
with
much
cheerfulness
continued
well
now
for
instance
sir
what
is
your
name
spangenberg
replied
the
other
and
mine
said
the
count
is
thorane
spangenberg
what
is
your
business
with
thorane
now
then
let
us
sit
down
the
affair
shall
at
once
be
settled
and
thus
the
affair
was
indeed
settled
at
once
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
person
i
have
here
named
spangenberg
and
the
same
evening
in
our
family
circle
the
story
was
not
only
told
by
the
waggish
interpreter
but
was
given
with
all
the
circumstances
and
gestures
after
these
confusions
disquietudes
and
grievances
the
former
security
and
thoughtlessness
soon
returned
in
which
the
young
particularly
live
from
day
to
day
if
it
be
in
any
degree
possible
my
passion
for
the
french
theatre
grew
with
every
performance
i
did
not
miss
an
evening
though
on
every
occasion
when
after
the
play
i
sat
down
with
the
family
to
supper
often
putting
the
remains
i
had
to
endure
the
constant
reproaches
of
my
father
that
theatres
were
useless
and
would
lead
to
nothing
in
these
cases
i
adduced
all
and
every
argument
which
is
at
hand
for
the
apologists
of
the
stage
when
they
fall
into
a
difficulty
like
mine
vice
in
prosperity
and
virtue
in
misfortune
are
in
the
end
set
right
by
poetical
justice
those
beautiful
examples
of
misdeeds
punished
sarah
and
the
of
were
very
energetically
cited
on
my
part
but
on
the
other
hand
i
often
came
off
worst
when
the
de
and
others
of
the
sort
were
in
the
bill
and
i
was
forced
to
bear
reproaches
for
the
delight
felt
by
the
public
in
the
deceits
of
intriguing
servants
and
the
successful
follies
of
prodigal
young
men
neither
party
was
convinced
but
my
father
was
very
soon
reconciled
to
the
theatre
when
he
saw
that
i
advanced
with
incredible
rapidity
in
the
french
language
juvenile
attempt
at
the
drama
men
are
so
constituted
that
everybody
would
rather
undertake
himself
what
he
sees
done
by
others
whether
he
has
aptitude
for
it
or
not
i
had
soon
exhausted
the
whole
range
of
the
french
stage
several
pieces
i
had
already
witnessed
for
the
third
and
fourth
times
all
had
passed
before
my
eyes
and
mind
from
the
stateliest
tragedy
to
the
most
frivolous
and
as
when
a
child
i
had
presumed
to
imitate
terence
i
did
not
fail
now
as
a
boy
on
a
much
more
inciting
occasion
to
copy
the
french
forms
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
want
of
ability
there
were
then
performed
some
pieces
in
the
taste
of
piron
they
partook
somewhat
of
the
nature
of
parody
and
were
much
liked
these
representations
particularly
attracted
me
the
little
gold
wings
of
a
lively
mercury
the
thunderbolt
of
a
disguised
jupiter
an
amorous
danaë
or
by
whatever
name
a
fair
one
visited
by
the
gods
might
be
called
if
indeed
it
were
not
a
shepherdess
or
huntress
to
whom
they
descended
and
as
elements
of
this
kind
from
or
the
of
pomey
were
humming
in
swarms
about
my
head
i
had
soon
put
together
in
my
imagination
a
little
piece
of
the
kind
of
which
i
can
only
say
that
the
scene
was
rural
and
that
there
was
no
lack
in
it
of
king
daughters
princes
or
gods
mercury
especially
made
so
vivid
an
impression
on
my
senses
that
i
could
almost
be
sworn
that
i
had
seen
him
with
my
own
eyes
i
presented
my
friend
derones
with
a
very
neat
copy
made
by
myself
which
he
accepted
with
quite
a
special
grace
and
with
a
truly
patronizing
air
glanced
hastily
over
the
manuscript
pointed
out
a
few
grammatical
blunders
found
some
speeches
too
long
and
at
last
promised
to
examine
and
judge
the
work
more
attentively
when
he
had
the
requisite
leisure
to
my
modest
question
whether
the
piece
could
by
any
chance
be
performed
he
assured
me
that
it
was
not
altogether
impossible
in
the
theatre
he
said
a
great
deal
went
by
favour
and
he
would
support
me
with
all
his
heart
only
the
affair
must
be
kept
private
for
he
had
himself
once
on
a
time
surprised
the
directors
with
a
piece
of
his
own
and
it
would
certainly
have
been
acted
if
it
had
not
been
too
soon
detected
that
he
was
the
author
i
promised
him
all
possible
silence
and
already
saw
in
my
mind
eye
the
name
of
my
piece
posted
up
in
large
letters
on
the
comers
of
the
streets
and
squares
as
my
friend
generally
was
the
opportunity
of
playing
the
master
was
but
too
desirable
he
read
the
piece
through
with
attention
and
while
he
sat
down
with
me
to
make
some
trivial
alterations
turned
the
whole
thing
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
completely
so
that
not
one
stone
remained
on
another
he
struck
out
added
took
away
one
character
substituted
another
in
short
went
on
with
the
maddest
wantonness
in
the
world
so
that
my
hair
stood
on
end
my
previous
persuasion
that
he
must
understand
the
matter
allowed
him
to
have
his
way
for
he
had
often
laid
before
me
so
much
about
the
three
unities
of
aristotle
the
regularity
of
the
french
drama
the
probability
the
harmony
of
the
verse
and
all
that
belongs
to
these
that
i
was
forced
to
regard
him
not
merely
as
informed
but
thoroughly
grounded
he
abused
the
english
and
scorned
the
germans
in
short
he
laid
before
me
the
whole
dramaturgic
litany
which
i
have
so
often
in
my
life
been
compelled
to
hear
like
the
boy
in
the
fable
i
carried
my
mangled
offspring
home
and
strove
in
vain
to
bring
it
to
life
as
however
i
would
not
quite
abandon
it
i
caused
a
fair
copy
of
my
first
manuscript
after
a
few
alterations
to
be
made
by
our
clerk
which
i
presented
to
my
father
and
thus
gained
so
much
that
for
a
long
time
he
let
me
eat
my
supper
in
quiet
after
the
play
was
over
dramatic
theories
this
unsuccessful
attempt
had
made
me
reflective
and
i
resolved
now
to
learn
at
the
very
sources
these
theories
these
laws
to
which
every
one
appealed
but
which
had
become
suspicious
to
me
chiefly
through
the
impoliteness
of
my
arrogant
master
this
was
not
indeed
difficult
but
laborious
i
immediately
read
corneille
on
the
three
and
learned
from
that
how
people
would
have
it
but
why
they
desired
it
so
was
by
no
means
clear
to
me
and
what
was
worst
of
all
i
fell
at
once
into
still
greater
confusion
when
i
made
myself
acquainted
with
the
disputes
on
the
and
read
the
prefaces
in
which
corneille
and
racine
are
obliged
to
defend
themselves
against
the
critics
and
public
here
at
least
i
plainly
saw
that
no
man
knew
what
he
wanted
that
a
piece
like
which
had
produced
the
noblest
effect
was
to
be
condemned
at
the
command
of
an
cardinal
that
racine
the
idol
of
the
french
living
in
my
day
who
had
now
also
become
my
idol
for
i
had
got
intimately
acquainted
with
him
when
schöff
von
olenschlager
made
us
children
act
in
which
the
part
of
nero
fell
to
me
that
racine
i
say
even
in
his
own
day
was
not
able
to
get
on
with
the
amateurs
nor
critics
through
all
this
i
became
more
perplexed
than
ever
and
after
having
pestered
myself
a
long
time
with
this
talking
backwards
and
forwards
and
theoretical
quackery
of
the
previous
century
threw
them
to
the
dogs
and
was
the
more
resolute
in
casting
all
the
rubbish
away
the
more
i
thought
i
observed
that
the
authors
themselves
who
had
produced
excellent
things
when
they
began
to
speak
about
them
when
they
set
forth
the
grounds
of
their
treatment
when
they
desired
to
defend
justify
or
excuse
themselves
were
not
always
able
to
hit
the
proper
mark
i
hastened
back
again
therefore
to
the
living
present
attended
the
theatre
far
more
zealously
read
more
scrupulously
and
connectedly
so
that
i
had
perseverance
enough
this
time
to
work
through
the
whole
of
racine
and
molière
and
a
great
part
of
corneille
the
king
lieutenant
still
lived
at
our
house
he
in
no
respect
had
changed
his
deportment
especially
towards
us
but
it
was
observable
and
the
interpreter
made
it
still
more
evident
to
us
that
he
no
longer
discharged
his
duties
with
the
same
cheerfulness
and
zeal
as
at
the
outset
though
always
with
the
same
rectitude
and
fidelity
his
character
and
habits
which
showed
the
spaniard
rather
than
the
frenchman
his
caprices
which
were
not
without
their
influence
on
his
business
his
unbending
will
under
all
circumstances
his
susceptibility
as
to
everything
that
concerned
his
person
or
reputation
all
this
together
might
perhaps
sometimes
bring
him
into
conflict
with
his
superiors
add
to
this
that
he
had
been
wounded
in
a
duel
which
had
arisen
in
the
theatre
and
it
was
deemed
wrong
that
the
king
lieutenant
himself
chief
of
police
should
have
committed
a
punishable
offence
as
i
have
said
all
this
may
have
contributed
to
make
him
live
more
retired
and
here
and
there
perhaps
to
act
with
less
energy
meanwhile
a
considerable
part
of
the
pictures
he
had
ordered
had
been
delivered
count
thorane
passed
his
leisure
hours
in
examining
them
while
in
the
aforesaid
he
had
them
nailed
up
canvas
after
canvas
large
and
small
side
by
side
and
because
there
was
want
of
space
even
one
over
another
and
then
taken
down
and
rolled
up
the
works
were
constantly
inspected
anew
the
parts
that
were
considered
the
most
successful
were
repeatedly
enjoyed
but
there
was
no
want
of
wishes
that
this
or
that
had
been
differently
done
hence
arose
a
new
and
very
singular
operation
as
one
painter
best
executed
figures
another
and
distances
a
third
trees
a
fourth
flowers
it
struck
the
count
that
these
talents
might
perhaps
be
combined
in
the
paintings
and
that
in
this
way
perfect
works
might
be
produced
a
beginning
was
made
at
once
by
having
for
instance
some
beautiful
cattle
painted
into
a
finished
landscape
but
because
there
was
not
always
adequate
room
for
all
and
a
few
sheep
more
or
less
was
no
great
matter
to
the
the
largest
landscape
proved
in
the
end
too
narrow
now
also
the
painter
of
figures
had
to
introduce
the
shepherd
and
some
travellers
these
deprived
each
other
of
air
as
we
may
say
and
we
marvelled
that
they
were
not
all
stifled
even
in
the
most
open
country
no
one
could
anticipate
what
was
to
come
of
the
matter
and
when
it
was
finished
it
gave
no
satisfaction
the
painters
were
annoyed
they
had
gained
something
by
their
first
orders
but
lost
by
these
though
the
count
paid
for
them
also
very
liberally
and
as
the
parts
worked
into
each
other
in
one
picture
by
several
hands
produced
no
good
effect
after
all
the
trouble
every
one
at
last
fancied
that
his
own
work
had
been
spoiled
and
destroyed
by
that
of
the
others
hence
the
artists
were
within
a
of
falling
out
and
becoming
irreconcilably
hostile
to
each
other
these
alterations
or
rather
additions
were
made
in
the
studio
where
i
remained
quite
alone
with
the
artists
and
it
amused
me
to
hunt
out
from
the
studies
particularly
of
animals
this
or
that
individual
or
group
and
to
propose
it
for
the
foreground
or
the
distance
in
which
respect
they
many
times
either
from
conviction
or
kindness
complied
with
my
wishes
the
painter
seekatz
the
partners
in
this
affair
were
therefore
greatly
discouraged
especially
seekatz
a
very
hypochondriacal
retired
man
who
indeed
by
his
incomparable
humour
was
the
best
of
companions
among
friends
but
who
when
he
worked
desired
to
work
alone
abstracted
and
perfectly
free
this
man
after
solving
difficult
problems
and
finishing
them
with
the
greatest
diligence
and
the
warmest
love
of
which
he
was
always
capable
was
forced
to
travel
repeatedly
from
darmstadt
to
frankfort
either
to
change
something
in
his
own
pictures
or
to
touch
up
those
of
others
or
even
to
allow
under
his
superintendence
a
third
person
to
convert
his
pictures
into
a
variegated
mess
his
peevishness
augmented
his
resistance
became
more
decided
and
a
great
deal
of
effort
was
necessary
on
our
part
to
guide
this
gossip
for
he
was
one
also
according
to
the
count
wishes
i
still
remember
that
when
the
boxes
were
standing
ready
to
pack
up
all
the
pictures
in
the
order
in
which
the
upholsterer
at
their
place
of
destination
might
fix
them
up
at
once
a
small
but
indispensable
bit
of
afterwork
was
demanded
but
seekatz
could
not
be
moved
to
come
over
he
had
by
way
of
conclusion
done
the
best
he
could
having
represented
in
paintings
to
be
placed
over
the
doors
the
four
elements
as
children
and
boys
after
life
and
having
expended
the
greatest
care
not
only
on
the
figures
but
on
the
accessories
these
were
delivered
and
paid
for
and
he
thought
he
was
quit
of
the
business
for
ever
but
now
he
was
to
come
over
again
that
he
might
enlarge
by
a
few
touches
of
his
pencil
some
figures
the
size
of
which
was
too
small
another
he
thought
could
do
it
just
as
well
he
had
already
set
about
some
new
work
in
short
he
would
not
come
the
time
for
sending
off
the
pictures
was
at
hand
they
must
also
have
opportunity
to
dry
every
delay
was
precarious
and
the
count
in
despair
was
about
to
have
him
fetched
in
military
fashion
we
all
wished
to
see
the
pictures
finally
gone
and
found
at
last
no
expedient
than
for
the
gossip
interpreter
to
seat
himself
in
a
wagon
and
fetch
over
the
refractory
subject
with
his
wife
and
child
he
was
kindly
received
by
the
count
well
treated
and
at
last
dismissed
with
liberal
payment
after
the
pictures
had
been
sent
away
there
was
great
peace
in
the
house
the
in
the
attic
was
cleaned
and
given
up
to
me
and
my
father
when
he
saw
the
boxes
go
could
not
refrain
from
wishing
to
send
off
the
count
after
them
for
much
as
the
tastes
of
the
count
coincided
with
his
own
much
as
he
must
have
rejoiced
to
see
his
principle
of
patronizing
living
artists
so
generously
followed
out
by
a
man
richer
than
himself
much
as
it
may
have
flattered
him
that
his
collection
had
been
the
occasion
of
bringing
so
considerable
a
profit
to
a
number
of
brave
artists
in
a
pressing
time
he
nevertheless
felt
such
a
repugnance
to
the
foreigner
who
had
intruded
into
his
house
that
he
could
not
think
well
of
any
of
his
doings
one
ought
to
employ
painters
but
not
degrade
them
to
one
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
what
they
have
done
according
to
their
conviction
and
ability
even
if
it
does
not
thoroughly
please
one
and
not
be
perpetually
carping
at
it
in
short
in
spite
of
all
the
own
generous
endeavours
there
could
once
for
all
be
no
mutual
understanding
my
father
only
visited
that
room
when
the
count
was
at
table
and
i
can
recall
but
one
instance
when
seekatz
having
excelled
himself
and
the
wish
to
see
these
pictures
having
brought
the
whole
house
together
my
father
and
the
count
met
and
manifested
a
common
pleasure
in
these
works
of
art
which
they
could
not
take
in
each
other
departure
of
thorane
scarcely
therefore
had
the
house
been
cleared
of
the
chests
and
boxes
than
the
plan
for
removing
the
count
which
had
formerly
been
begun
but
was
afterwards
interrupted
was
resumed
the
endeavour
was
made
to
gain
justice
by
representations
equity
by
entreaties
favour
by
influence
and
the
were
prevailed
upon
to
decide
thus
the
count
was
to
change
his
lodgings
and
our
house
in
consideration
of
the
burden
borne
day
and
night
for
several
years
uninterruptedly
was
to
be
exempt
for
the
future
from
billetting
but
to
furnish
a
plausible
pretext
for
this
we
were
to
take
in
lodgers
on
the
first
floor
which
the
count
had
occupied
and
thus
render
a
new
quartering
as
it
were
impossible
the
count
who
after
the
separation
from
his
dear
pictures
felt
no
further
peculiar
interest
in
the
house
and
hoped
moreover
to
be
soon
recalled
and
placed
elsewhere
was
pleased
to
move
without
opposition
to
another
good
residence
and
left
us
in
peace
and
soon
afterwards
he
quitted
the
city
and
received
different
appointments
in
gradation
but
it
was
rumoured
not
to
his
own
satisfaction
meantime
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
pictures
which
he
had
preserved
with
so
much
care
felicitously
arranged
in
his
brother
chateau
he
wrote
sometimes
sent
dimensions
and
had
different
pieces
executed
by
the
artists
so
often
named
at
last
we
heard
nothing
further
about
him
except
after
several
years
we
were
assured
that
he
had
died
as
governor
of
one
of
the
french
colonies
in
the
west
indies
the
obsolete
word
gossip
has
been
revived
as
an
equivalent
for
the
german
but
it
should
be
observed
that
this
word
not
only
signifies
godfather
but
that
the
person
whose
child
has
another
person
for
godfather
or
godmother
is
that
person
or
feminine
a

much
inconvenience
as
the
quartering
of
the
french
had
occasioned
us
we
had
become
so
accustomed
to
it
that
we
could
not
fail
to
miss
it
nor
could
we
children
fail
to
feel
as
if
the
house
were
deserted
moreover
it
was
not
decreed
that
we
should
again
attain
perfect
family
unity
new
lodgers
were
already
agreed
upon
and
after
some
sweeping
and
scouring
planing
and
rubbing
with
painting
and
varnishing
the
house
was
completely
restored
again
the
moritz
with
his
family
very
worthy
friends
of
my
parents
moved
in
he
was
not
a
native
of
frankfort
but
an
able
jurist
and
man
of
business
and
managed
the
legal
affairs
of
many
small
princes
counts
and
lords
i
never
saw
him
otherwise
than
cheerful
and
pleasant
and
diligent
with
his
law
papers
his
wife
and
children
gentle
quiet
and
benevolent
did
not
indeed
increase
the
sociableness
of
our
house
for
they
kept
to
themselves
but
a
stillness
a
peace
returned
which
we
had
not
enjoyed
for
a
long
time
i
now
again
occupied
my
attic
room
in
which
the
ghosts
of
the
many
pictures
sometimes
hovered
before
me
while
i
strove
to
frighten
them
away
by
labour
and
study
the
counsellor
of
legation
moritz
a
brother
of
the
chancellor
came
from
this
time
often
to
our
house
he
was
even
more
a
man
of
the
world
had
a
handsome
figure
while
his
manners
were
easy
and
agreeable
he
also
managed
the
affairs
of
different
persons
of
rank
and
on
occasions
of
meetings
of
creditors
and
imperial
commissions
frequently
came
into
contact
with
my
father
they
had
a
nigh
opinion
of
each
other
and
commonly
stood
on
the
side
of
the
creditors
though
they
were
generally
obliged
to
perceive
much
to
their
vexation
that
a
majority
of
the
agents
on
such
occasions
are
usually
gained
over
to
the
side
of
the
debtors
the
counsellor
of
legation
readily
communicated
his
knowledge
was
a
friend
to
mathematics
and
as
these
did
not
occur
in
his
present
course
of
life
he
made
himself
a
pleasure
by
helping
me
on
in
this
branch
of
study
i
was
thus
enabled
to
finish
my
architectural
sketches
more
accurately
than
heretofore
and
to
profit
more
by
the
instruction
of
a
who
now
also
occupied
us
an
hour
every
day
lessons
in
drawing
this
good
old
man
was
indeed
only
half
an
artist
we
were
obliged
to
draw
and
combine
strokes
from
which
eyes
and
noses
lips
and
ears
nay
at
last
whole
faces
and
heads
were
to
arise
but
of
natural
or
artistic
forms
there
was
no
thought
we
were
tormented
a
long
while
with
this
pro
of
the
human
figure
and
when
the
passions
of
le
brun
were
given
us
to
copy
it
was
supposed
at
last
that
we
had
made
great
progress
but
ever
these
caricatures
did
not
improve
us
then
we
went
off
to
landscapes
foliage
and
all
the
things
which
in
ordinary
instruction
are
practised
without
consistency
or
method
finally
we
dropped
into
close
imitation
and
neatness
of
strokes
without
troubling
ourselves
about
the
merit
or
taste
of
the
original
in
these
attempts
our
father
led
the
way
in
an
exemplary
manner
he
had
never
drawn
but
he
was
unwilling
to
remain
behind
now
that
his
children
pursued
this
art
and
would
give
even
in
his
old
age
an
example
how
they
should
proceed
in
their
youth
several
heads
therefore
of
piazetta
from
his
sheets
in
small
octavo
he
copied
with
an
english
upon
the
finest
dutch
paper
in
these
he
not
only
observed
the
greatest
clearness
of
outline
but
most
accurately
imitated
the
hatching
of
the
with
a
light
hand
only
too
slightly
as
in
his
desire
to
avoid
hardness
he
brought
no
keeping
into
his
sketches
yet
they
were
always
soft
and
accurate
his
unrelaxing
and
untiring
assiduity
went
so
far
that
he
drew
the
whole
considerable
collection
number
by
number
while
we
children
jumped
from
one
head
to
another
and
chose
only
those
that
pleased
us
about
this
time
the
project
long
under
consideration
for
giving
us
lessons
in
music
was
earned
into
effect
and
the
last
impulse
to
it
certainly
deserves
mention
it
was
settled
that
we
should
learn
the
harpsichord
but
there
was
always
a
dispute
about
the
choice
of
a
master
at
last
i
went
once
accidentally
into
the
room
of
one
of
my
companions
who
was
just
taking
his
lesson
on
the
harpsichord
and
found
the
teacher
a
most
charming
man
for
each
finger
of
the
right
and
left
hand
he
had
a
nickname
by
which
he
indicated
in
the
merriest
way
when
it
was
to
be
used
the
black
and
white
keys
were
likewise
symbolically
designated
and
even
the
tones
appeared
under
figurative
names
such
a
motley
company
worked
most
pleasantly
together
fingering
and
time
seemed
to
become
perfectly
easy
and
obvious
and
while
the
scholar
was
put
into
the
best
humour
everything
else
succeeded
beautifully
the
eccentric
scarcely
had
i
reached
home
than
i
importuned
my
parents
to
set
about
the
matter
in
good
earnest
at
last
and
give
us
this
incomparable
man
for
our
master
on
the
harpsichord
they
hesitated
and
made
inquiries
they
indeed
heard
nothing
bad
of
the
teacher
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
particularly
good
meanwhile
i
had
informed
my
sister
of
all
the
droll
names
we
could
hardly
wait
for
the
lesson
and
succeeded
in
having
the
man
engaged
the
reading
of
the
notes
began
first
but
as
no
jokes
occurred
here
we
comforted
ourselves
with
the
hope
that
when
we
went
to
the
harpsichord
and
the
fingers
were
needed
the
jocular
method
would
commence
but
neither
keys
nor
fingering
seemed
to
afford
opportunity
for
any
comparisons
dry
as
the
notes
were
with
their
strokes
on
and
between
the
five
lines
the
black
and
white
keys
were
no
less
so
and
not
a
syllable
was
heard
either
of
thumbling
or
goldfinger
while
the
countenance
of
the
man
remained
as
imperturbable
during
his
dry
teaching
as
it
had
been
before
during
his
dry
jests
my
sister
reproached
me
most
bitterly
for
having
deceived
her
and
actually
believed
that
it
was
all
an
invention
of
mine
but
i
was
myself
confounded
and
learned
little
though
the
man
at
once
went
regularly
enough
to
work
for
i
kept
always
expecting
that
the
former
jokes
would
make
their
appearance
and
so
consoled
my
sister
from
one
day
to
another
they
did
not
reappear
however
and
i
should
never
have
been
able
to
explain
the
riddle
if
another
accident
had
not
solved
it
for
me
one
of
my
companions
came
in
during
a
lesson
and
at
once
all
the
pipes
of
the
humorous
were
opened
the
thumblings
and
pointerlings
the
pickers
and
stealers
as
he
used
to
call
the
fingers
the
falings
and
galings
meaning
f
and
g
the
fielings
and
gielings
meaning
f
and
g
sharp
became
once
more
extant
and
made
the
most
wonderful
mannikins
my
young
friend
could
not
leave
off
laughing
and
was
rejoiced
that
one
could
learn
in
such
a
merry
manner
he
vowed
that
he
would
give
his
parents
no
peace
until
they
had
given
him
such
an
excellent
man
for
a
teacher
and
thus
the
way
to
two
arts
was
early
enough
opened
to
me
according
to
the
principles
of
a
modern
theory
of
education
merely
by
good
luck
and
without
any
conviction
that
i
should
be
furthered
therein
by
a
native
talent
my
father
maintained
that
everybody
ought
to
learn
drawing
for
which
reason
he
especially
venerated
the
emperor
maximilian
by
whom
this
had
been
expressly
commanded
he
therefore
held
me
to
it
more
steadily
than
to
music
which
on
the
other
hand
he
especially
recommended
to
my
sister
and
even
out
of
the
hours
for
lessons
kept
her
fast
during
a
good
part
of
the
day
at
her
harpsichord
but
the
more
i
was
in
this
way
made
to
press
on
the
more
i
wished
to
press
forward
of
myself
and
my
hours
of
leisure
were
employed
in
all
sorts
of
curious
occupations
from
my
earliest
years
i
felt
a
love
for
the
investigation
of
natural
things
it
is
often
regarded
as
an
instinct
of
cruelty
that
children
like
at
last
to
break
tear
and
devour
objects
with
which
for
a
long
time
they
have
played
and
which
they
have
handled
in
various
manners
yet
even
in
this
way
is
manifested
the
curiosity
the
desire
of
learning
how
such
things
hang
together
how
they
look
within
i
remember
that
as
a
child
i
pulled
flowers
to
pieces
to
see
how
the
leaves
were
inserted
into
the
calyx
or
even
plucked
birds
to
observe
how
the
feathers
were
inserted
into
the
wings
children
are
not
to
be
blamed
for
this
when
even
our
naturalists
believe
they
get
their
knowledge
oftener
by
separation
and
division
than
by
union
and
combination
more
by
killing
than
by
making
alive
an
armed
loadstone
very
neatly
sewed
up
in
scarlet
cloth
was
one
day
destined
to
experience
the
effects
of
this
spirit
of
inquiry
for
the
secret
force
of
attraction
which
it
exercised
not
only
on
the
little
iron
bar
attached
to
it
but
which
was
of
such
a
kind
that
it
could
gain
strength
and
could
daily
bear
a
heavier
weight
this
mysterious
virtue
had
so
excited
my
admiration
that
for
a
long
time
i
was
pleased
with
merely
staring
at
its
operation
but
at
last
i
thought
i
might
arrive
at
some
nearer
revelation
by
tearing
away
the
external
covering
this
was
done
but
i
became
no
wiser
in
consequence
as
the
naked
iron
taught
me
nothing
further
this
also
i
took
off
and
i
held
in
my
hand
the
mere
stone
with
which
i
never
grew
weary
of
making
experiments
of
various
kinds
on
filings
and
needles
experiments
from
which
my
youthful
mind
drew
no
further
advantage
beyond
that
of
a
varied
experience
i
could
not
manage
to
reconstruct
the
whole
arrangement
the
parts
were
scattered
and
i
lost
the
wondrous
phenomenon
at
the
same
time
with
the
apparatus
nor
was
i
more
fortunate
in
putting
together
an
electrical
machine
a
friend
of
the
family
whose
youth
had
fallen
in
the
time
when
electricity
occupied
all
minds
often
told
us
how
as
a
child
he
had
desired
to
possess
such
a
machine
had
got
together
the
principal
requisites
and
by
the
aid
of
an
old
and
some
medicine
bottles
had
produced
tolerable
results
as
he
readily
and
frequently
repeated
the
story
and
imparted
to
us
some
general
information
on
electricity
we
children
found
the
thing
very
plausible
and
long
tormented
ourselves
with
an
old
and
some
medicine
bottles
without
producing
even
the
smallest
result
we
nevertheless
adhered
to
our
belief
and
were
much
delighted
when
at
the
time
of
the
fair
among
other
rarities
magical
and
legerdemain
tricks
an
electrical
machine
performed
its
marvels
which
like
those
of
magnetism
were
at
that
time
already
very
numerous
the
want
of
confidence
in
the
public
method
of
instruction
was
daily
increasing
people
looked
about
for
private
tutors
and
because
single
families
could
not
afford
the
expense
several
of
them
united
to
attain
their
object
yet
the
children
seldom
agreed
the
young
man
had
not
sufficient
authority
and
after
frequently
repeated
vexations
there
were
only
angry
partings
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
other
arrangements
were
thought
of
which
should
be
more
permanent
as
well
as
more
advantageous
pfeil
the
thought
of
establishing
had
arisen
from
the
necessity
which
every
one
felt
for
having
the
french
language
taught
and
communicated
orally
my
father
had
brought
up
a
young
person
who
had
been
his
footman
valet
secretary
and
in
short
successively
all
in
all
this
man
whose
name
was
pfeil
spoke
french
well
after
he
had
married
and
his
patrons
had
to
think
of
a
situation
for
him
they
hit
upon
the
plan
of
making
him
establish
a
which
extended
gradually
into
a
small
academy
in
which
everything
necessary
and
at
last
even
greek
and
latin
were
taught
the
extensive
connexions
of
frankfort
caused
young
french
and
english
men
to
be
brought
to
this
establishment
that
they
might
learn
german
and
be
otherwise
cultivated
pfeil
who
was
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
and
of
the
most
wonderful
energy
and
activity
superintended
the
whole
very
laudably
and
as
he
could
never
be
employed
enough
and
was
obliged
to
keep
for
his
scholars
he
set
about
music
on
the
occasion
and
practised
the
harpsichord
with
such
zeal
that
without
having
previously
touched
a
note
he
very
soon
played
with
perfect
readiness
and
spirit
he
seemed
to
have
adopted
my
maxim
that
nothing
can
more
cheer
and
excite
young
people
than
when
at
mature
years
one
declares
one
self
again
a
learner
and
at
an
age
when
new
accomplishments
are
acquired
with
difficulty
one
endeavours
nevertheless
by
zeal
and
perseverance
to
excel
the
younger
who
are
more
favoured
by
nature
by
this
love
of
pfeil
was
led
to
the
instruments
themselves
and
while
he
hoped
to
obtain
the
best
came
into
connexion
with
frederici
of
gera
whose
instruments
were
celebrated
far
and
wide
he
took
a
number
of
them
on
sale
and
had
now
the
joy
of
seeing
not
only
one
piano
but
many
set
up
in
his
residence
and
of
practising
and
being
heard
upon
them
the
vivacity
of
this
man
brought
a
great
rage
for
music
into
our
house
my
father
remained
on
lasting
good
terms
with
him
up
to
certain
points
of
dispute
a
large
piano
of
frederici
was
purchased
also
for
us
which
i
adhering
to
my
harpsichord
hardly
touched
but
which
so
much
increased
the
troubles
of
my
sister
as
to
do
proper
honour
to
the
new
instrument
she
had
to
spend
some
time
longer
every
day
in
practice
while
my
father
as
overseer
and
pfeil
as
a
model
and
encouraging
friend
alternately
took
their
positions
at
her
side
a
singular
taste
of
my
father
caused
much
inconvenience
to
us
children
this
was
the
cultivation
of
silk
of
the
advantages
of
which
when
it
should
be
more
widely
extended
he
had
a
high
opinion
some
acquaintances
at
hanau
where
the
breeding
of
the
worms
was
carried
on
with
great
care
gave
him
the
immediate
impulse
at
the
proper
season
the
eggs
were
sent
to
him
from
that
place
and
as
soon
as
the
showed
sufficient
leaves
they
had
to
be
stripped
and
the
scarcely
visible
creatures
were
most
diligently
tended
tables
and
stands
with
boards
were
set
up
in
a
garret
chamber
to
afford
them
more
room
and
sustenance
for
they
grew
rapidly
and
after
their
last
change
of
skin
were
so
voracious
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
get
leaves
enough
to
feed
them
nay
they
had
to
be
fed
day
and
night
as
everything
depends
upon
there
being
no
deficiency
of
nourishment
when
the
great
and
wondrous
change
is
about
to
take
place
in
them
if
the
weather
was
favourable
this
business
might
indeed
be
regarded
as
a
pleasant
amusement
but
if
the
cold
set
in
so
that
the
suffered
it
was
exceedingly
troublesome
still
more
unpleasant
was
it
when
rain
fell
during
the
last
epoch
for
these
creatures
can
not
at
all
endure
moisture
and
the
wet
leaves
had
to
be
carefully
wiped
and
dried
which
could
not
always
be
done
quite
perfectly
and
for
this
or
perhaps
some
other
reason
also
various
diseases
came
among
the
flock
by
which
the
poor
things
were
swept
off
in
thousands
the
corruption
which
ensued
produced
a
smell
really
pestilential
and
because
the
dead
and
diseased
had
to
be
taken
away
and
separated
from
the
healthy
the
business
was
indeed
extremely
wearisome
and
repulsive
and
caused
many
an
unhappy
hour
to
us
children
after
we
had
one
year
passed
the
finest
weeks
of
the
spring
and
summer
in
tending
the
we
were
obliged
to
assist
our
father
in
another
business
which
though
simpler
was
no
less
troublesome
the
roman
views
which
bound
by
black
rods
at
the
top
and
bottom
had
hung
for
many
years
on
the
walls
of
the
old
house
had
become
very
yellow
through
the
light
dust
and
smoke
and
not
a
little
unsightly
through
the
flies
if
such
uncleanliness
was
not
to
be
tolerated
in
the
new
house
yet
on
the
other
hand
these
pictures
had
gained
in
value
to
my
father
in
consequence
of
his
longer
absence
from
the
places
represented
for
in
the
outset
such
copies
only
serve
to
refresh
and
vivify
the
impressions
shortly
before
received
they
seem
trifling
in
comparison
and
at
the
best
only
a
melancholy
substitute
but
as
the
remembrance
of
the
original
forms
fades
more
and
more
the
copies
imperceptibly
assume
their
place
they
become
as
dear
to
us
as
those
once
were
and
what
we
at
first
contemned
now
gains
esteem
and
affection
thus
it
is
with
all
copies
and
particularly
with
portraits
no
one
is
easily
satisfied
with
the
counterfeit
of
an
object
still
present
but
how
we
value
every
of
one
who
is
absent
or
departed
in
short
with
this
feeling
of
his
former
extravagance
my
father
wished
that
these
engravings
might
be
restored
as
much
as
possible
it
was
well
known
that
this
could
be
done
by
bleaching
and
the
operation
always
critical
with
large
plates
was
undertaken
under
rather
unfavourable
circumstances
for
the
large
boards
on
which
the
smoked
engravings
were
moistened
and
exposed
to
the
sun
stood
in
the
gutters
before
the
garret
windows
leaning
against
the
roof
and
were
therefore
liable
to
many
accidents
the
chief
point
was
that
the
paper
should
never
thoroughly
dry
but
must
be
kept
constantly
moist
this
was
the
duty
of
my
sister
and
myself
and
the
idleness
which
would
have
been
otherwise
so
desirable
was
excessively
annoying
on
account
of
the
tedium
and
impatience
and
the
watchfulness
which
allowed
of
no
distraction
the
end
however
was
attained
and
the
bookbinder
who
fixed
each
sheet
upon
thick
paper
did
his
best
to
match
and
repair
the
margins
which
had
been
here
and
there
torn
by
our
inadvertence
all
the
sheets
together
were
bound
in
a
volume
and
for
this
time
preserved
lessons
in
english
that
we
children
might
not
be
wanting
in
every
variety
of
life
and
learning
a
teacher
of
the
english
language
must
announce
himself
just
at
this
time
who
pledged
himself
to
teach
english
to
anybody
not
entirely
raw
in
languages
within
four
weeks
and
to
advance
him
to
such
a
degree
that
with
some
diligence
he
could
help
himself
further
his
price
was
moderate
and
he
was
indifferent
as
to
the
number
of
scholars
at
one
lesson
my
father
instantly
determined
to
make
the
attempt
and
took
lessons
in
connexion
with
my
sister
and
myself
from
this
expeditious
master
the
hours
were
faithfully
kept
there
was
no
want
of
repeating
our
lessons
other
exercises
were
neglected
rather
than
this
during
the
four
weeks
and
the
teacher
parted
from
us
and
we
from
him
with
satisfaction
as
he
remained
longer
in
the
town
and
found
many
employers
he
came
from
time
to
time
to
look
after
us
and
to
help
us
grateful
that
we
had
been
among
the
first
who
placed
confidence
in
him
and
proud
to
be
able
to
cite
us
as
examples
to
the
others
my
father
in
consequence
of
this
entertained
a
new
anxiety
that
english
might
neatly
stand
in
the
series
of
my
other
studies
in
languages
now
i
will
confess
that
it
became
more
and
more
burdensome
for
me
to
take
my
occasions
for
study
now
from
this
grammar
or
collection
of
examples
now
from
that
now
from
one
author
now
from
another
and
thus
to
divert
my
interest
in
a
subject
every
hour
it
occurred
to
me
therefore
that
i
might
despatch
all
at
once
and
i
invented
a
romance
of
six
or
seven
brothers
and
sisters
who
separated
from
each
other
and
scattered
over
the
world
should
communicate
with
each
other
alternately
as
to
their
conditions
and
feelings
the
eldest
brother
gives
an
account
in
good
german
of
all
the
manifold
objects
and
incidents
of
his
journey
the
sister
in
a
ladylike
style
with
short
sentences
and
nothing
but
stops
much
as
was
afterwards
written
answers
now
him
now
the
other
brothers
partly
about
domestic
matters
and
partly
about
affairs
of
the
heart
one
brother
studies
theology
and
writes
a
very
formal
latin
to
which
he
often
adds
a
greek
postscript
to
another
brother
holding
the
place
of
mercantile
clerk
at
hamburgh
the
english
correspondence
naturally
falls
while
a
still
younger
one
at
marseilles
has
the
french
for
the
italian
was
found
a
musician
on
his
first
trip
into
the
world
while
the
youngest
of
all
a
sort
of
pert
nestling
had
applied
himself
to
the
other
languages
having
been
cut
off
from
him
and
by
means
of
his
frightful
cyphers
brought
the
rest
of
them
into
despair
and
my
parents
into
a
hearty
laugh
at
the
good
notion
i
sought
for
matter
to
fill
up
this
singular
form
by
studying
the
geography
of
the
countries
in
which
my
creations
resided
and
by
inventing
for
those
dry
localities
all
sorts
of
human
incidents
which
had
some
affinity
with
the
characters
and
employments
of
my
heroes
thus
my
became
much
more
voluminous
my
father
was
better
satisfied
and
i
was
much
sooner
made
aware
of
the
acquirements
and
the
sort
of
readiness
in
which
i
was
wanting
now
as
such
things
once
begun
have
no
end
and
no
limits
so
it
happened
in
the
present
case
for
while
i
strove
to
attain
the
odd
and
to
write
it
as
well
as
i
could
read
it
i
soon
discovered
that
i
ought
to
know
hebrew
from
which
alone
the
modern
corrupted
dialect
could
be
derived
and
handled
with
any
certainty
i
consequently
explained
the
necessity
of
my
learning
hebrew
to
my
father
and
earnestly
besought
his
consent
for
i
had
a
still
higher
object
everywhere
i
heard
it
said
that
to
understand
the
old
as
well
as
the
new
testament
the
original
languages
were
requisite
the
latter
i
could
read
quite
easily
because
that
there
might
be
no
want
of
exercise
even
on
sundays
the
epistles
and
gospels
had
after
church
to
be
recited
translated
and
in
some
measure
explained
i
now
designed
doing
the
same
thing
with
the
old
testament
the
peculiarities
of
which
had
always
especially
interested
me
rector
albrecht
my
father
who
did
not
like
to
do
anything
by
halves
determined
to
request
the
rector
of
our
gymnasium
one
albrecht
to
give
me
private
lessons
weekly
until
i
should
have
acquired
what
was
most
essential
in
so
simple
a
language
for
he
hoped
that
if
it
would
not
be
despatched
as
soon
as
english
was
learned
it
could
at
least
be
managed
in
double
the
time
rector
albrecht
was
one
of
the
most
original
figures
in
the
world
short
broad
but
not
fat
without
being
deformed
in
short
an
æsop
in
gown
and
wig
his
more
than
face
was
completely
twisted
into
a
sarcastic
smile
while
his
eyes
always
remained
large
and
though
red
were
always
brilliant
and
intelligent
he
lived
in
the
old
cloister
of
the
barefoot
friars
the
seat
of
the
gymnasium
even
as
a
child
i
had
often
visited
him
in
company
with
my
parents
and
had
with
a
kind
of
trembling
delight
glided
through
the
long
dark
passages
the
chapels
transformed
into
the
place
broken
up
and
full
of
stairs
and
corners
without
annoying
me
he
questioned
me
familiarly
whenever
we
met
and
praised
and
encouraged
me
one
day
on
the
changing
of
the
pupil
places
after
a
public
examination
he
saw
me
standing
as
a
mere
spectator
not
far
from
his
chair
while
he
distributed
the
silver
virtutis
et
i
was
probably
gazing
very
eagerly
upon
the
little
bag
out
of
which
he
drew
the
medals
he
nodded
to
me
descended
a
step
and
handed
me
one
of
the
silver
pieces
my
joy
was
great
although
others
thought
that
this
gift
bestowed
upon
a
boy
not
belonging
to
the
school
was
out
of
all
order
but
for
this
the
good
old
man
cared
but
little
having
always
played
the
eccentric
and
that
in
a
striking
manner
he
had
a
very
good
reputation
as
a
schoolmaster
and
understood
his
business
although
age
no
more
allowed
him
to
practise
it
thoroughly
but
almost
more
than
by
his
own
infirmities
was
he
hindered
by
greater
circumstances
and
as
i
already
knew
he
was
satisfied
neither
with
the
consistory
the
inspectors
the
clergy
nor
the
teachers
to
his
natural
temperament
which
inclined
to
satire
and
the
watching
for
faults
and
defects
he
allowed
free
play
both
in
his
programs
and
his
public
speeches
and
as
lucian
was
almost
the
only
writer
whom
he
read
and
esteemed
he
spiced
all
that
he
said
and
wrote
with
biting
ingredients
fortunately
for
those
with
whom
he
was
dissatisfied
he
never
went
directly
to
work
but
only
jeered
at
the
defects
which
he
wanted
to
reprove
with
hints
allusions
classic
passages
and
scripture
texts
his
delivery
moreover
he
always
read
his
discourses
was
unpleasant
unintelligible
and
above
all
was
often
interrupted
by
a
cough
but
more
frequently
by
a
hollow
laugh
with
which
he
was
wont
to
announce
and
accompany
the
biting
passages
this
singular
man
i
found
to
be
mild
and
obliging
when
i
began
to
take
lessons
from
him
i
now
went
to
him
daily
at
six
in
the
evening
and
always
experienced
a
secret
pleasure
when
the
outer
door
closed
behind
me
and
i
had
to
thread
the
long
dark
we
sat
in
his
library
at
a
table
covered
with
a
lucian
never
quitting
his
side
hebrew
studies
in
spite
of
all
my
willingness
i
did
not
get
at
the
matter
without
difficulty
for
my
teacher
could
not
suppress
certain
sarcastic
remarks
as
to
the
real
truth
about
hebrew
i
concealed
from
him
my
designs
upon
and
spoke
of
a
better
understanding
of
the
original
text
he
smiled
at
this
and
said
i
should
be
satisfied
if
i
only
learned
to
read
this
vexed
me
in
secret
and
i
concentrated
all
my
attention
when
we
came
to
the
letters
i
found
an
alphabet
something
like
the
greek
of
which
the
forms
were
easy
and
the
names
for
the
most
part
not
strange
to
me
all
this
i
had
soon
comprehended
and
retained
and
supposed
we
should
now
go
to
reading
that
this
was
done
from
right
to
left
i
was
well
aware
but
now
all
at
once
appeared
a
new
army
of
little
characters
and
signs
of
points
and
strokes
of
all
sorts
which
were
in
fact
to
represent
vowels
at
this
i
wondered
the
more
as
there
were
manifestly
vowels
in
the
larger
alphabet
and
the
others
only
appeared
to
be
hidden
under
strange
appellations
it
was
also
taught
that
the
jewish
nation
so
long
as
it
flourished
actually
were
satisfied
with
the
first
signs
and
knew
no
other
way
to
write
and
read
most
willingly
then
would
i
have
gone
on
along
this
ancient
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
easier
path
but
my
worthy
declared
rather
sternly
that
we
must
go
by
the
grammar
as
it
had
been
approved
and
composed
reading
without
these
points
and
strokes
he
said
was
a
very
hard
undertaking
and
could
be
accomplished
only
by
the
learned
and
those
who
were
well
practised
i
must
therefore
make
up
my
mind
to
learn
these
little
characters
but
the
matter
became
to
me
more
and
more
confused
now
it
seemed
some
of
the
first
and
larger
primitive
letters
had
no
value
in
their
places
in
order
that
their
little
kindred
might
not
stand
there
in
vain
now
they
indicated
a
gentle
breathing
now
a
guttural
more
or
less
rough
and
now
served
as
mere
equivalents
but
finally
when
one
fancied
that
one
had
well
noted
everything
some
of
these
personages
both
great
and
small
were
rendered
inoperative
so
that
the
eyes
always
had
very
much
and
the
lips
very
little
to
do
as
that
of
which
i
already
knew
the
contents
had
now
to
be
stuttered
in
a
strange
gibberish
in
which
a
certain
snuffle
and
gargle
were
not
a
little
commended
as
something
unattainable
i
in
a
certain
degree
deviated
from
the
matter
and
diverted
myself
in
a
childish
way
with
the
singular
names
of
these
accumulated
signs
there
were
emperors
kings
and
dukes
which
as
accents
governing
here
and
there
gave
me
not
a
little
entertainment
but
even
these
shallow
jests
soon
lost
their
charm
nevertheless
i
was
indemnified
inasmuch
as
by
reading
translating
repeating
and
committing
to
memory
the
substance
of
the
book
came
out
more
vividly
and
it
was
this
properly
about
which
i
desired
to
be
enlightened
even
before
this
time
the
contradiction
between
tradition
and
the
actual
and
possible
had
appeared
to
me
very
striking
and
i
had
often
put
my
private
tutors
to
a
with
the
sun
which
stood
still
on
gibeon
and
the
moon
in
the
vale
of
ajalon
to
say
nothing
of
other
improbabilities
and
incongruities
everything
of
this
kind
was
now
awakened
while
in
order
to
master
the
hebrew
i
occupied
myself
exclusively
with
the
old
testament
and
studied
it
though
no
longer
in
luther
translation
but
in
the
literal
version
of
sebastian
schmid
printed
under
the
text
which
my
father
had
procured
for
me
here
unfortunately
our
lessons
began
to
be
defective
so
far
as
practice
in
the
language
was
concerned
reading
interpreting
grammar
transcribing
and
the
repetition
of
words
seldom
lasted
a
full
half
hour
for
i
immediately
began
to
aim
at
the
sense
of
the
matter
and
though
we
were
still
engaged
in
the
first
book
of
moses
to
utter
several
things
suggested
to
me
by
the
later
books
at
first
the
good
old
man
tried
to
restrain
me
from
such
digressions
but
at
last
they
seemed
to
entertain
him
also
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
suppress
his
characteristic
cough
and
chuckle
and
although
he
carefully
avoided
giving
me
any
information
that
might
have
compromised
himself
my
importunity
was
not
relaxed
nay
as
i
cared
more
to
set
forth
my
doubts
than
to
learn
their
solution
i
grew
constantly
more
vivacious
and
bold
seeming
justified
by
his
deportment
yet
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
him
except
that
ever
and
anon
he
would
exclaim
with
his
peculiar
shaking
laugh
ah
mad
fellow
ah
mad
boy
still
my
childish
vivacity
which
scrutinized
the
bible
on
all
sides
may
have
seemed
to
him
tolerably
serious
and
worthy
of
some
assistance
he
therefore
referred
me
after
a
time
to
the
large
english
biblical
work
which
stood
in
his
library
and
in
which
the
interpretation
of
difficult
and
doubtful
passages
was
attempted
in
an
intelligent
and
judicious
manner
by
the
great
labours
of
german
divines
the
translation
had
obtained
advantages
over
the
original
the
different
opinions
were
cited
and
at
last
a
kind
of
reconciliation
was
attempted
so
that
the
dignity
of
the
book
the
ground
of
religion
and
the
human
understanding
might
in
some
degree
now
is
often
as
towards
the
end
of
the
lesson
i
came
out
with
my
usual
questions
and
doubts
so
often
did
be
point
to
the
repository
i
took
the
volume
he
let
me
read
turned
over
his
lucian
and
when
i
made
any
remarks
on
the
book
his
ordinary
laugh
was
the
only
answer
to
my
sagacity
in
the
long
summer
days
he
let
me
sit
as
long
as
i
could
read
many
times
alone
after
a
time
he
suffered
me
to
take
one
volume
after
another
home
with
me
the
old
testament
a
man
may
turn
whither
he
pleases
and
undertake
anything
whatsoever
but
he
will
always
return
to
the
path
which
nature
has
once
prescribed
for
him
thus
it
happened
also
with
me
in
the
present
case
my
trouble
about
the
language
about
the
contents
of
the
sacred
scriptures
themselves
ended
at
last
in
producing
in
my
imagination
a
livelier
picture
of
that
beautiful
and
famous
land
its
environs
and
its
vicinities
as
well
as
of
the
people
and
events
by
which
that
little
spot
of
earth
was
made
glorious
for
thousands
of
years
this
small
space
was
to
see
the
origin
and
growth
of
the
human
race
thence
we
were
to
derive
our
first
and
only
accounts
of
primitive
history
and
such
a
locality
was
to
lie
before
our
imagination
no
less
simple
and
comprehensible
than
varied
and
adapted
to
the
most
wonderful
migrations
and
settlements
here
between
four
designated
rivers
a
small
delightful
spot
was
separated
from
the
whole
habitable
earth
for
youthful
man
here
he
was
to
unfold
his
first
capacities
and
here
at
the
same
time
was
the
lot
to
befall
him
which
was
appointed
for
all
his
posterity
namely
that
of
losing
peace
by
striving
after
knowledge
paradise
was
trifled
away
men
increased
and
grew
worse
and
the
elohim
not
yet
accustomed
to
the
wickedness
of
the
new
race
became
impatient
and
utterly
destroyed
it
only
a
few
were
saved
from
the
universal
deluge
and
scarcely
had
this
dreadful
flood
ceased
than
the
well
known
ancestral
soil
lay
once
more
before
the
grateful
eyes
of
the
preserved
two
rivers
out
of
four
the
euphrates
and
tigris
still
flowed
in
their
beds
the
name
of
the
first
remained
the
other
seemed
to
be
pointed
out
by
its
course
minuter
traces
of
paradise
were
not
to
be
looked
for
after
so
great
a
revolution
the
renewed
race
of
man
went
forth
from
hence
a
second
time
it
found
occasion
to
sustain
and
employ
itself
in
all
sorts
of
ways
but
chiefly
to
gather
around
it
large
herds
of
tame
animals
and
to
wander
with
them
in
every
direction
this
mode
of
life
as
well
as
the
increase
of
the
families
soon
compelled
the
people
to
disperse
they
could
not
at
once
resolve
to
let
their
relatives
and
friends
go
for
ever
they
hit
upon
the
thought
of
building
a
lofty
tower
which
should
show
them
the
way
back
from
the
far
distance
but
this
attempt
like
their
first
endeavour
miscarried
they
could
not
be
at
the
same
time
happy
and
wise
numerous
and
united
the
elohim
confounded
their
minds
the
building
remained
unfinished
the
men
were
dispersed
the
world
was
peopled
but
sundered
but
our
regards
our
interests
are
still
fastened
to
these
regions
at
last
the
founder
of
a
race
again
goes
forth
from
hence
and
is
so
fortunate
as
to
stamp
a
distinct
character
upon
his
descendants
and
by
that
means
to
unite
them
for
all
time
to
come
into
a
great
nation
inseparable
through
all
changes
of
place
or
destiny
the
old
testament
from
the
euphrates
abraham
not
without
divine
guidance
wanders
towards
the
west
the
desert
opposes
no
invincible
barrier
to
his
march
he
attains
the
jordan
passes
over
its
waters
and
spreads
himself
over
the
fair
southern
regions
of
palestine
this
land
was
already
occupied
and
tolerably
inhabited
mountains
not
extremely
high
but
rocky
and
barren
were
severed
by
many
watered
vales
favourable
to
cultivation
towns
villages
and
solitary
settlements
lay
scattered
over
the
plain
and
on
the
slopes
of
the
great
valley
the
waters
of
which
are
collected
in
jordan
thus
inhabited
thus
tilled
was
the
land
but
the
world
was
still
large
enough
and
the
men
were
not
so
circumspect
necessitous
and
active
as
to
usurp
at
once
the
whole
adjacent
country
between
their
possessions
were
extended
large
spaces
in
which
grazing
herds
could
freely
move
in
every
direction
in
one
of
these
spaces
abraham
resides
his
brother
lot
is
near
him
but
they
can
not
long
remain
in
such
places
the
very
condition
of
a
land
the
population
of
which
is
now
increasing
now
decreasing
and
the
productions
of
which
are
never
kept
in
equilibrium
with
the
wants
produces
unexpectedly
a
famine
and
the
stranger
suffers
alike
with
the
native
whose
own
support
he
has
rendered
difficult
by
his
accidental
presence
the
two
chaldean
brothers
move
onward
to
egypt
and
thus
is
traced
out
for
us
the
theatre
on
which
for
some
thousands
of
years
the
most
important
events
of
the
world
were
to
be
enacted
from
the
tigris
to
the
euphrates
from
the
euphrates
to
the
nile
we
see
the
earth
peopled
and
this
space
also
is
traversed
by
a
man
who
has
already
become
worthy
to
us
moving
to
and
fro
with
his
goods
and
cattle
and
in
a
short
time
abundantly
increasing
them
the
brothers
return
but
taught
by
the
distress
they
have
endured
they
determine
to
part
both
indeed
tarry
in
southern
canaan
but
while
abraham
remains
at
hebron
near
the
wood
of
mamre
lot
departs
for
the
valley
of
siddim
which
if
our
imagination
is
bold
enough
to
give
jordan
a
subterranean
outlet
so
that
in
place
of
the
present
dead
sea
we
should
have
dry
ground
can
and
must
appear
like
a
second
paradise
a
conjecture
all
the
more
probable
because
the
residents
about
there
notorious
for
effeminacy
and
wickedness
lead
us
to
infer
that
they
led
an
easy
and
luxurious
life
lot
lives
among
them
but
apart
but
hebron
and
the
wood
of
mamre
appear
to
us
as
the
important
place
where
the
lord
speaks
with
abraham
and
promises
him
all
the
land
as
far
as
his
eye
can
reach
in
four
directions
from
these
quiet
districts
from
these
shepherd
tribes
who
can
associate
with
celestials
entertain
them
as
guests
and
hold
many
conversations
with
them
we
are
compelled
to
turn
our
glance
once
more
towards
the
east
and
to
think
of
the
condition
of
the
surrounding
world
which
on
the
whole
perhaps
may
have
been
like
that
of
canaan
families
hold
together
they
unite
and
the
mode
of
life
of
the
tribes
is
determined
by
the
locality
which
they
have
appropriated
or
appropriate
on
the
mountains
which
send
down
their
waters
to
the
tigris
we
find
warlike
populations
who
even
thus
early
foreshadow
those
and
and
in
a
campaign
prodigious
for
those
times
give
us
a
prelude
of
future
achievements
chedor
laomer
king
of
elam
has
already
a
mighty
influence
over
his
allies
he
reigns
a
long
while
for
twelve
years
before
abraham
arrival
in
canaan
he
had
made
all
the
people
tributary
to
him
as
far
as
the
jordan
they
revolted
at
last
and
the
allies
equipped
for
war
we
find
them
unawares
upon
a
route
by
which
probably
abraham
also
reached
canaan
the
people
on
the
left
and
lower
side
of
the
jordan
were
subdued
chedor
laomer
directs
his
march
southwards
towards
the
people
of
the
desert
then
wending
north
he
smites
the
amalekites
and
when
he
has
also
overcome
the
amorites
he
reaches
canaan
falls
upon
the
kings
of
the
valley
of
siddim
smites
and
scatters
them
and
marches
with
great
spoil
up
the
jordan
in
order
to
extend
his
conquests
as
far
as
lebanon
among
the
captives
despoiled
and
dragged
along
with
their
property
is
lot
who
shares
the
fate
of
the
country
in
which
he
lives
a
guest
abraham
learns
this
and
here
at
once
we
behold
the
patriarch
a
warrior
and
hero
he
gathers
together
his
servants
divides
them
into
troops
attacks
and
falls
upon
the
luggage
of
booty
confuses
the
victors
who
could
not
suspect
another
enemy
in
the
rear
and
brings
back
his
brother
and
his
goods
with
a
great
deal
more
belonging
to
the
conquered
kings
abraham
by
means
of
this
brief
contest
acquires
as
it
were
the
whole
land
to
the
inhabitants
he
appears
as
a
protector
saviour
and
by
his
disinterestedness
a
king
gratefully
the
kings
of
the
valley
receive
him
melchisedek
the
king
and
priest
with
blessings
now
the
prophecies
of
an
endless
posterity
are
renewed
nay
they
take
a
wider
and
wider
scope
from
the
waters
of
the
euphrates
to
the
river
of
egypt
all
the
lands
are
promised
him
but
yet
there
seems
a
difficulty
with
respect
to
his
next
heirs
he
is
eighty
years
of
age
and
has
no
son
sarai
less
trusting
in
the
heavenly
powers
than
he
becomes
impatient
she
desires
after
the
oriental
fashion
to
have
a
descendant
by
means
of
her
maid
but
scarcely
is
hagar
given
up
to
the
master
of
the
house
scarcely
is
there
hope
of
a
son
than
dissensions
arise
the
wife
treats
her
own
dependent
ill
enough
and
hagar
flies
to
seek
a
happier
position
among
other
tribes
she
returns
not
without
a
higher
intimation
and
ishmael
is
born
abraham
is
now
years
old
and
the
promises
of
a
numerous
posterity
are
constantly
repeated
so
that
in
the
end
the
pair
regard
them
as
ridiculous
and
yet
sarai
becomes
at
last
pregnant
and
brings
forth
a
son
to
whom
the
name
of
isaac
is
given
natural
and
revealed
religion
history
for
the
most
part
rests
upon
the
legitimate
propagation
of
the
human
race
the
most
important
events
of
the
world
require
to
be
traced
to
the
secrets
of
families
and
thus
the
marriages
of
the
patriarchs
give
occasion
for
peculiar
considerations
it
is
as
if
the
divinity
who
loves
to
guide
the
destiny
of
mankind
wished
to
prefigure
here
connubial
events
of
every
kind
abraham
so
long
united
by
childless
marriage
to
a
beautiful
woman
whom
many
coveted
finds
himself
by
his
hundredth
year
the
husband
of
two
women
the
father
of
two
sons
and
at
this
moment
his
domestic
peace
is
broken
two
women
and
two
sons
by
different
mothers
can
not
possibly
agree
the
party
less
favoured
by
law
usage
and
opinion
must
yield
abraham
must
sacrifice
his
attachment
to
hagar
and
ishmael
both
are
dismissed
and
hagar
is
compelled
now
against
her
will
to
go
upon
a
road
which
she
once
took
in
voluntary
flight
at
first
it
seems
to
the
destruction
of
herself
and
child
but
the
angel
of
the
lord
who
had
before
sent
her
back
now
rescues
her
again
that
ishmael
also
may
become
a
great
people
and
that
the
most
improbable
of
all
promises
may
be
fulfilled
beyond
its
limits
two
parents
in
advanced
years
and
one
son
of
their
old
age
here
at
last
one
might
expect
domestic
quiet
and
earthly
happiness
by
no
means
heaven
is
yet
preparing
the
heaviest
trial
for
the
patriarch
but
of
this
we
can
not
speak
without
premising
several
considerations
if
a
natural
universal
religion
was
to
arise
and
a
special
revealed
one
to
be
developed
from
it
the
countries
in
which
our
imagination
has
hitherto
lingered
the
mode
of
life
the
race
of
men
were
the
fittest
for
the
purpose
at
least
we
do
not
find
in
the
whole
world
anything
equally
favourable
and
encouraging
even
to
natural
religion
if
we
assume
that
it
arose
earlier
in
the
human
mind
there
pertains
much
of
delicacy
of
sentiment
for
it
rests
upon
the
conviction
of
an
universal
providence
which
conducts
the
order
of
the
world
as
a
whole
a
particular
religion
revealed
by
heaven
to
this
or
that
people
carries
with
it
the
belief
in
a
special
providence
which
the
divine
being
vouchsafes
to
certain
favoured
men
families
races
and
people
this
faith
seems
to
develope
itself
with
difficulty
from
man
inward
nature
it
requires
tradition
usage
and
the
warrant
of
a
primitive
time
beautiful
is
it
therefore
that
the
israelitish
tradition
represents
the
very
first
men
who
confide
in
this
particular
providence
as
heroes
of
faith
following
all
the
commands
of
that
high
being
on
whom
they
acknowledge
themselves
dependent
just
as
blindly
as
undisturbed
by
doubts
they
are
unwearied
in
awaiting
the
later
fulfilments
of
his
promises
as
a
particular
revealed
religion
rests
upon
the
idea
that
one
man
can
be
more
favoured
by
heaven
than
another
so
it
also
arises
from
the
separation
of
classes
the
first
men
appeared
closely
allied
but
their
employments
soon
divided
them
the
hunter
was
the
freest
of
all
from
him
was
developed
the
warrior
and
the
ruler
those
who
tilled
the
field
bound
themselves
to
the
soil
erected
dwellings
and
barns
to
preserve
what
they
had
gained
and
could
estimate
themselves
pretty
highly
because
their
condition
promised
durability
and
security
the
herdsman
in
his
position
seemed
to
have
acquired
the
most
unbounded
condition
and
unlimited
property
the
increase
of
herds
proceeded
without
end
and
the
space
which
was
to
support
them
widened
itself
on
all
sides
these
three
classes
seemed
from
the
very
first
to
have
regarded
each
other
with
dislike
and
contempt
and
as
the
herdsman
was
an
abomination
to
the
townsman
so
did
he
in
turn
separate
from
the
other
the
hunters
vanish
from
our
sight
among
the
hills
and
only
as
conquerors
the
patriarchs
belonged
to
the
shepherd
class
their
manner
of
life
upon
the
ocean
of
deserts
and
pastures
gave
breadth
and
freedom
to
their
minds
the
vault
of
heaven
under
which
they
dwelt
with
all
its
nightly
stars
elevated
their
feelings
and
they
more
than
the
active
skilful
huntsman
or
the
secure
careful
householding
husbandman
had
need
of
the
immovable
faith
that
a
god
walked
beside
them
visited
them
cared
for
them
guided
and
saved
them
we
are
compelled
to
make
another
reflection
in
passing
to
the
rest
of
the
history
humane
beautiful
and
cheering
as
the
religion
of
the
patriarchs
appears
yet
traits
of
savageness
and
cruelty
run
through
it
out
of
which
man
may
emerge
or
into
which
he
may
again
be
sunk
that
hatred
should
seek
to
appease
itself
by
the
blood
by
the
death
of
the
conquered
enemy
is
natural
that
men
concluded
a
peace
upon
the
among
the
ranks
of
the
slain
may
easily
be
conceived
that
they
should
in
like
manner
think
to
give
validity
to
a
contract
by
slain
animals
follows
from
the
preceding
the
notion
also
that
slain
creatures
could
attract
propitiate
and
gain
over
the
gods
whom
they
always
looked
upon
as
partisans
either
opponents
or
allies
is
likewise
not
at
all
surprising
but
if
we
confine
our
attention
to
the
sacrifices
and
consider
the
way
in
which
they
were
offered
in
that
primitive
time
we
find
a
singular
and
to
our
notions
altogether
repugnant
custom
probably
derived
from
the
usages
of
war
that
the
sacrificed
animals
of
every
kind
and
whatever
number
was
devoted
had
to
be
hewn
in
two
halves
and
laid
out
on
two
sides
so
that
in
the
space
between
them
were
those
who
wished
to
make
a
covenant
with
the
deity
another
dreadful
feature
wonderfully
and
portentously
pervades
that
fair
world
namely
that
everything
consecrated
or
vowed
must
die
this
also
was
probably
an
usage
of
war
transferred
to
peace
the
inhabitants
of
a
city
which
forcibly
defends
itself
are
threatened
with
such
a
vow
it
is
taken
by
storm
or
otherwise
nothing
is
left
alive
men
never
and
often
women
children
and
even
cattle
share
a
similar
fate
such
sacrifices
are
rashly
and
superstitiously
and
with
more
or
less
distinctness
promised
to
the
gods
and
those
whom
the
votary
would
willingly
spare
even
his
nearest
of
kin
his
own
children
may
thus
bleed
the
expiatory
victims
of
such
a
delusion
the
old
testament
in
the
mild
and
truly
patriarchal
character
of
abraham
such
a
savage
kind
of
worship
could
not
arise
but
the
godhead
which
often
to
tempt
us
seems
to
put
forth
those
qualities
which
man
is
inclined
to
assign
to
it
imposes
a
monstrous
task
upon
him
he
must
offer
up
his
son
as
a
pledge
of
the
new
covenant
and
if
he
follows
the
usage
must
not
only
kill
and
burn
him
but
cut
him
in
two
and
await
between
the
smoking
entrails
a
new
promise
from
the
benignant
deity
abraham
blindly
and
without
lingering
prepares
to
execute
the
command
to
heaven
the
will
is
sufficient
abraham
trials
are
now
at
an
end
for
they
could
not
be
carried
further
but
sarai
dies
and
this
gives
abraham
an
opportunity
for
taking
typical
possession
of
the
land
of
canaan
he
requires
a
grave
and
this
is
the
first
time
he
looks
out
for
a
possession
in
this
earth
he
had
before
this
probably
sought
out
a
cave
by
the
grove
of
mamre
this
he
purchases
with
the
adjacent
field
and
the
legal
form
which
he
observes
on
the
occasion
shows
how
important
this
possession
is
to
him
indeed
it
was
more
so
perhaps
than
he
himself
supposed
for
there
he
his
sons
and
his
grandsons
were
to
rest
and
by
this
means
the
proximate
title
to
the
whole
land
as
well
as
the
everlasting
desire
of
his
posterity
to
gather
themselves
there
was
most
properly
grounded
from
this
time
forth
the
manifold
incidents
of
the
family
life
become
varied
abraham
still
keeps
strictly
apart
from
the
inhabitants
and
though
ishmael
the
son
of
an
egyptian
woman
has
married
a
daughter
of
that
land
isaac
is
obliged
to
wed
a
kinswoman
of
equal
birth
with
himself
abraham
despatches
his
servant
to
mesopotamia
to
the
relatives
whom
he
had
left
behind
there
the
prudent
eleazer
arrives
unknown
and
in
order
to
take
home
the
right
bride
tries
the
readiness
to
serve
of
the
girls
at
the
well
he
asks
to
drink
himself
and
rebecca
unasked
waters
his
camels
also
he
gives
her
presents
he
demands
her
in
marriage
and
his
suit
is
not
rejected
he
conducts
her
to
the
home
of
his
lord
and
she
is
wedded
to
isaac
in
this
case
too
issue
has
to
be
long
expected
rebecca
is
not
blessed
until
after
some
years
of
probation
and
the
same
discord
which
in
abraham
double
marriage
arose
through
two
mothers

proceeds
from

opposite

and
indifferent

to
the
birthright
which
fate
has
given
him
jacob
never

that
his

forced
him
back

every
opportunity
of
gaining
the
desirable
privilege

buys

jacob
flees
to
seek
his
fortune
in
the
land
of
his
forefathers
now
for
the
first
time
in
so
noble
a
family
appears
a
member
who
has
no
scruple
in
attaining
by
prudence
and
cunning
the
advantages
which
nature
and
circumstances
have
denied
him
it
has
often
enough
been
remarked
and
expressed
that
the
sacred
scriptures
by
no
means
intend
to
set
up
any
of
the
patriarchs
and
other
men
as
models
of
virtue
they
too
are
persons
of
the
most
different
characters
with
many
defects
and
failings
but
there
is
one
leading
trait
in
which
none
of
these
men
after
god
own
heart
can
be
wanting
that
is
an
immovable
faith
that
god
has
special
care
of
them
and
their
families
the
old
testament
general
natural
religion
properly
speaking
requires
no
faith
for
the
persuasion
that
a
great
producing
regulating
and
conducting
being
conceals
himself
as
it
were
behind
nature
to
make
himself
comprehensible
to
us
such
a
conviction
forces
itself
upon
every
one
nay
if
we
for
a
moment
let
drop
this
thread
which
conducts
us
through
life
it
may
be
immediately
and
everywhere
resumed
but
it
is
different
with
a
special
religion
which
announces
to
us
that
this
great
being
distinctly
and
interests
himself
for
one
individual
one
family
one
people
one
country
this
religion
is
founded
on
faith
which
must
be
immovable
if
it
would
not
be
instantly
destroyed
every
doubt
of
such
a
religion
is
fatal
to
it
one
may
return
to
conviction
but
not
to
faith
hence
the
endless
probation
the
delay
in
the
fulfilment
of
so
often
repeated
promises
by
which
the
capacity
for
faith
in
those
ancestors
is
set
in
the
clearest
light
it
is
in
this
faith
also
that
jacob
begins
his
expedition
and
if
by
his
craft
and
deceit
he
has
not
gained
our
affections
he
wins
them
by
his
lasting
and
inviolable
love
for
rachel
whom
he
himself
woos
on
the
instant
as
eleazar
had
courted
rebecca
for
his
father
in
him
the
promise
of
a
countless
people
was
first
to
be
fully
unfolded
he
was
to
see
many
sons
around
him
but
through
them
and
their
mothers
was
to
endure
manifold
sorrows
of
heart
seven
years
he
serves
for
his
beloved
without
impatience
and
without
wavering
his
crafty
like
himself
and
disposed
like
him
to
consider
legitimate
this
means
to
an
end
deceives
him
and
so
repays
him
for
what
he
has
done
to
his
brother
jacob
finds
in
his
arms
a
wife
whom
he
does
not
love
laban
indeed
endeavours
to
appease
him
by
giving
him
his
beloved
also
after
a
short
time
and
this
but
on
the
condition
of
seven
years
of
further
service
vexation
arises
out
of
vexation
the
wife
he
does
not
love
is
fruitful
the
beloved
one
bears
no
children
the
latter
like
sarai
desires
to
become
a
mother
through
her
handmaiden
the
former
grudges
her
even
this
advantage
she
also
presents
her
husband
with
a
maid
but
the
good
patriarch
is
now
the
most
troubled
man
in
the
world
he
has
four
women
children
by
three
and
none
from
her
he
loves
finally
she
also
is
favoured
and
joseph
tomes
into
the
world
the
late
fruit
of
the
most
passionate
attachment
jacob
fourteen
years
of
service
are
over
but
laban
is
unwilling
to
part
with
him
his
chief
and
most
trusty
servant
they
enter
into
a
new
compact
and
portion
the
flocks
between
them
laban
retains
the
white
ones
as
most
numerous
jacob
has
to
put
up
with
the
spotted
ones
as
the
mere
refuse
but
he
is
able
here
too
to
secure
his
own
advantage
and
as
by
a
paltry
mess
he
had
procured
the
birthright
and
by
a
disguise
his
father
blessing
he
manages
by
art
and
sympathy
to
appropriate
to
himself
the
best
and
largest
part
of
the
herds
and
on
this
side
also
he
becomes
the
truly
worthy
progenitor
of
the
people
of
israel
and
a
model
for
his
descendants
laban
and
his
household
remark
the
result
if
not
the
stratagem
vexation
ensues
jacob
flees
with
his
family
and
goods
and
partly
by
fortune
partly
by
cunning
escapes
the
pursuit
of
laban
rachel
is
now
about
to
present
him
another
son
but
dies
in
the
travail
benjamin
the
child
of
sorrow
survives
her
but
the
aged
father
is
to
experience
a
still
greater
sorrow
from
the
apparent
loss
of
his
son
joseph
perhaps
some
one
may
ask
why
i
have
so
circumstantially
narrated
histories
so
universally
known
and
so
often
repeated
and
explained
let
the
inquirer
be
satisfied
with
the
answer
that
i
could
in
no
other
way
exhibit
how
with
my
distracted
life
and
desultory
education
i
concentrated
my
mind
and
feelings
in
quiet
action
on
one
point
that
i
was
able
in
no
other
way
to
depict
the
peace
that
prevailed
about
me
even
when
all
without
was
so
wild
and
strange
if
an
ever
busy
imagination
of
which
that
tale
may
bear
witness
led
me
hither
and
thither
if
the
medley
of
fable
and
history
mythology
and
religion
threatened
to
bewilder
me
i
readily
fled
to
those
oriental
regions
plunged
into
the
first
books
of
moses
and
there
amid
the
scattered
found
myself
at
once
in
the
greatest
solitude
and
the
greatest
society
history
of
joseph
these
family
scenes
before
they
were
to
lose
themselves
in
a
history
of
the
jewish
nation
show
us
now
in
conclusion
a
form
by
which
the
hopes
and
fancies
of
the
young
in
particular
are
agreeably
excited
joseph
the
child
of
the
most
passionate
wedded
love
he
seems
to
us
tranquil
and
clear
and
predicts
to
himself
the
advantages
which
are
to
elevate
him
above
his
family
cast
into
misfortune
by
his
brothers
he
remains
steadfast
and
upright
in
slavery
resists
the
most
dangerous
temptations
rescues
himself
by
prophecy
and
is
elevated
according
to
his
deserts
to
high
honours
he
shows
himself
first
serviceable
and
useful
to
a
great
kingdom
then
to
his
own
kindred
he
is
like
his
ancestor
abraham
in
repose
and
greatness
his
grandfather
isaac
in
silence
and
devotedness
the
talent
for
traffic
inherited
from
his
father
he
exercises
on
a
large
scale
it
is
no
longer
flocks
which
are
gained
for
himself
from
a
but
people
with
all
their
possessions
which
he
knows
how
to
purchase
for
a
king
extremely
graceful
is
this
natural
story
only
it
appears
too
short
and
one
feels
called
upon
to
paint
it
in
detail
such
a
of
biblical
characters
and
events
given
only
in
outline
was
no
longer
strange
to
the
germans
the
personages
of
both
the
old
and
new
testaments
had
received
through
klopstock
a
tender
and
affectionate
nature
highly
pleasing
to
the
boy
as
well
as
to
many
of
his
contemporaries
of
bodmer
efforts
in
this
line
little
or
nothing
came
to
him
but
in
the
lion
by
moser
made
a
great
impression
on
the
young
heart
in
that
work
a
man
of
business
and
courtier
arrives
at
high
honours
through
manifold
tribulations
and
the
piety
for
which
they
threatened
to
destroy
him
became
early
and
late
his
sword
and
buckler
it
had
long
seemed
to
me
desirable
to
work
out
the
history
of
joseph
but
i
could
not
get
on
with
the
form
particularly
as
i
was
conversant
with
no
kind
of
versification
which
would
have
been
adapted
to
such
a
work
but
now
i
found
a
treatment
of
it
in
prose
very
suitable
and
i
applied
all
my
strength
to
its
execution
i
now
endeavoured
to
discriminate
and
paint
the
characters
and
by
the
interpolation
of
incidents
and
episodes
to
make
the
old
simple
history
a
new
and
independent
work
i
did
not
consider
what
indeed
youth
can
not
consider
that
was
necessary
to
such
a
design
and
that
this
could
only
arise
by
the
perceptions
of
experience
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
represented
to
myself
all
the
incidents
down
to
the
minutest
details
and
narrated
them
accurately
to
myself
in
their
succession
what
greatly
lightened
this
labour
was
a
circumstance
which
threatened
to
render
this
work
and
my
authorship
in
general
exceedingly
voluminous
a
young
man
of
various
capacities
but
who
had
become
imbecile
from
over
exertion
and
conceit
resided
as
a
ward
in
my
father
house
lived
quietly
with
the
family
and
if
allowed
to
go
on
in
his
usual
way
was
contented
and
agreeable
he
had
with
great
care
written
out
notes
of
his
academical
course
and
had
acquired
a
rapid
legible
hand
he
liked
to
employ
himself
in
writing
better
than
in
anything
else
and
was
pleased
when
something
was
given
him
to
copy
but
still
more
when
he
was
dictated
to
because
he
then
felt
carried
back
to
his
happy
academical
years
to
my
father
who
was
not
expeditious
in
writing
and
whose
german
letters
were
small
and
tremulous
nothing
could
be
more
desirable
and
he
was
consequently
accustomed
in
the
conduct
of
his
own
and
other
business
to
dictate
for
some
hours
a
day
to
this
young
man
i
found
it
no
less
convenient
during
the
intervals
to
see
all
that
passed
through
my
head
fixed
upon
paper
by
the
hand
of
another
and
my
natural
gift
of
feeling
and
imitation
grew
with
the
facility
of
catching
up
and
preserving
as
yet
i
had
not
undertaken
any
work
so
large
as
that
biblical
the
times
were
tolerably
quiet
and
nothing
recalled
my
imagination
from
palestine
and
egypt
thus
my
manuscripts
swelled
more
and
more
every
day
as
the
poem
which
i
recited
to
myself
as
it
were
in
the
air
stretched
along
the
paper
and
only
a
few
pages
from
time
to
time
needed
to
be
rewritten
when
the
work
was
done
for
to
my
own
astonishment
it
really
came
to
an
end
i
reflected
that
from
former
year
many
poems
were
extant
which
did
not
even
now
appear
to
me
utterly
despicable
and
which
if
written
together
in
the
same
size
with
joseph
would
make
a
very
neat
quarto
to
which
the
title
miscellaneous
poems
might
be
given
i
was
pleased
with
this
as
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
quietly
imitating
and
celebrated
authors
i
had
composed
a
good
number
of
anacreontic
poems
which
on
account
of
the
convenience
of
the
metre
and
the
easiness
of
the
subject
flowed
forth
readily
enough
but
these
i
could
not
well
take
as
they
were
not
in
rhyme
and
my
desire
before
all
things
was
to
show
my
father
something
that
would
please
him
so
much
the
more
therefore
did
the
spiritual
odes
seem
suitable
which
i
had
very
zealously
attempted
in
imitation
of
the
of
elias
schlegel
one
of
these
written
to
celebrate
the
descent
of
christ
into
hell
received
much
applause
from
my
parents
and
friends
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
please
myself
for
some
years
afterwards
the
texts
of
the
sunday
which
were
always
to
be
had
printed
i
studied
with
diligence
they
were
indeed
very
weak
and
i
could
well
believe
that
my
verses
of
which
i
had
composed
many
in
the
prescribed
manner
were
equally
worthy
of
being
set
to
music
and
performed
for
the
edification
of
the
congregation
these
and
many
like
them
i
had
for
more
than
a
year
before
copied
with
my
own
hand
because
through
this
private
exercise
i
was
released
from
the
copies
of
the
now
all
were
corrected
and
put
in
order
and
no
great
persuasion
was
needed
to
have
them
neatly
copied
by
the
young
man
who
was
so
fond
of
writing
i
hastened
with
them
to
the
bookbinder
and
when
very
soon
after
i
handed
the
volume
to
my
father
he
encouraged
me
with
peculiar
satisfaction
to
furnish
a
similar
quarto
every
year
which
he
did
with
the
greater
conviction
as
i
had
produced
the
whole
in
my
spare
moments
alone
plitt
sermons
another
circumstance
increased
my
tendency
to
these
theological
or
rather
biblical
studies
the
senior
of
the
ministry
john
philip
fresenius
a
mild
man
of
handsome
agreeable
appearance
who
was
respected
by
his
congregation
and
the
whole
city
as
an
exemplary
pastor
and
good
preacher
but
who
because
he
stood
forth
against
the
herrnhuters
was
not
in
the
best
odour
with
the
peculiarly
pious
while
on
the
other
hand
he
had
made
himself
famous
and
almost
sacred
with
the
multitude
by
the
conversion
of
a
general
who
had
been
mortally
wounded
this
man
died
and
his
successor
plitt
a
tall
handsome
dignified
man
who
brought
from
his
he
had
been
a
professor
in
marburg
the
gift
of
teaching
rather
than
of
edifying
immediately
announced
a
sort
of
religious
course
to
which
his
sermons
were
to
be
devoted
in
a
certain
methodical
connexion
i
had
already
as
i
was
compelled
to
go
to
church
remarked
the
distribution
of
the
subject
and
could
now
and
then
show
myself
off
by
a
pretty
complete
recitation
of
a
sermon
but
now
as
much
was
said
in
the
congregation
both
for
and
against
the
new
senior
and
many
placed
no
great
confidence
in
his
announced
didactic
sermons
i
undertook
to
write
them
out
more
carefully
and
i
succeeded
the
better
from
having
made
smaller
attempts
in
a
seat
very
convenient
for
hearing
but
concealed
from
sight
i
was
extremely
attentive
and
on
the
alert
the
moment
he
said
amen
i
hastened
from
the
church
and
consumed
a
couple
of
hours
in
rapidly
dictating
what
i
had
fixed
in
my
memory
and
on
paper
so
that
i
could
hand
in
the
written
sermon
before
dinner
my
father
was
very
proud
of
this
success
and
the
good
friend
of
the
family
who
had
just
come
in
to
dinner
also
shared
in
the
joy
indeed
this
friend
was
very
to
me
because
i
had
so
made
his
my
own
that
in
my
repeated
visits
to
him
to
get
impressions
of
seals
for
my
collection
of
i
could
recite
long
passages
from
it
till
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
the
next
sunday
i
prosecuted
the
work
with
equal
zeal
and
as
the
mechanical
part
of
it
mainly
interested
me
i
did
not
reflect
upon
what
i
wrote
and
preserved
during
the
first
quarter
these
efforts
may
have
continued
pretty
much
the
same
but
as
i
fancied
at
last
in
my
that
i
found
no
particular
enlightenment
as
to
the
bible
nor
clearer
insight
into
dogmas
the
small
vanity
which
was
thus
gratified
seemed
to
me
too
dearly
purchased
for
me
to
pursue
the
matter
with
the
same
zeal
the
sermons
once
so
grew
more
and
more
meagre
and
before
long
i
should
have
relinquished
this
labour
altogether
if
my
father
who
was
a
fast
friend
to
completeness
had
not
by
words
and
promises
induced
me
to
persevere
till
the
last
sunday
in
trinity
though
at
the
conclusion
scarcely
more
than
the
text
the
statement
and
the
divisions
were
scribbled
on
little
pieces
of
paper
my
father
was
particularly
pertinacious
on
this
point
of
completeness
what
was
once
undertaken
must
be
finished
even
if
the
inconvenience
tedium
vexation
nay
uselessness
of
the
thing
begun
were
plainly
manifested
in
the
meantime
it
seemed
as
if
he
regarded
completeness
as
the
only
end
and
perseverance
as
the
only
virtue
if
in
our
family
circle
in
the
long
winter
evenings
we
had
begun
to
read
a
book
aloud
we
were
compelled
to
finish
though
we
were
all
in
despair
about
it
and
my
father
himself
was
the
first
to
yawn
i
still
remember
such
a
winter
when
we
had
thus
to
work
our
way
through
bower
of
the
it
was
a
terrible
time
as
little
or
nothing
that
occurs
in
ecclesiastical
affairs
can
interest
children
and
young
people
still
with
all
my
inattention
and
repugnance
so
much
of
that
reading
remained
in
my
mind
that
i
was
able
in
after
times
to
take
up
many
threads
of
the
narrative
lessons
in
fencing
amid
all
these
heterogeneous
occupations
and
labours
which
followed
each
other
so
rapidly
that
one
could
hardly
reflect
whether
they
were
permissible
and
useful
my
father
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
main
object
he
endeavoured
to
direct
my
memory
and
my
talent
for
apprehending
and
combining
to
objects
of
jurisprudence
and
therefore
gave
me
a
small
book
by
hopp
in
the
shape
of
a
catechism
and
worked
up
according
to
the
form
and
substance
of
the
institutions
i
soon
learned
questions
and
answers
by
heart
and
could
represent
the
catechist
as
well
as
the
catechumen
and
as
in
religious
instruction
at
that
time
one
of
the
chief
exercises
was
to
find
passages
in
the
bible
as
readily
as
possible
so
here
a
similar
acquaintance
with
the
was
found
necessary
in
which
also
i
soon
became
completely
versed
my
father
wished
me
to
go
on
and
the
little
struve
was
taken
in
hand
but
here
affairs
did
not
proceed
so
rapidly
the
form
of
the
work
was
not
so
favourable
for
beginners
that
they
could
help
themselves
on
nor
was
my
father
method
of
illustration
so
liberal
as
greatly
to
interest
me
not
only
by
the
warlike
state
in
which
we
lived
for
some
years
but
also
by
civil
life
itself
and
the
perusal
of
history
and
romances
was
it
made
clear
to
me
that
there
were
many
cases
in
which
the
laws
are
silent
and
give
no
help
to
the
individual
who
must
then
see
how
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
by
himself
we
had
now
reached
the
period
when
according
to
the
old
routine
we
were
besides
other
things
to
learn
to
fence
and
ride
that
we
might
guard
our
skins
upon
occasion
and
have
no
pedantic
appearance
on
horseback
as
to
the
first
the
practice
was
very
agreeable
to
us
for
we
had
already
long
ago
contrived
to
make
out
of
with
neatly
woven
of
willow
to
protect
the
hands
now
we
might
get
real
steel
blades
and
the
clash
we
made
with
them
was
very
merry
there
were
two
in
the
city
an
old
earnest
german
who
went
to
work
in
a
severe
and
solid
style
and
a
frenchman
who
sought
to
gain
his
advantage
by
advancing
and
retreating
and
by
light
fugitive
thrusts
which
he
always
accompanied
by
cries
opinions
varied
as
to
whose
manner
was
the
best
the
little
company
with
which
i
was
to
take
lessons
sided
with
the
frenchman
and
we
speedily
accustomed
ourselves
to
move
backwards
and
forwards
make
passes
and
recover
always
breaking
out
into
the
usual
exclamations
but
several
of
our
acquaintance
bad
gone
to
the
german
teacher
and
practised
precisely
the
opposite
these
distinct
modes
of
treating
so
important
an
exercise
the
conviction
of
each
that
his
master
was
the
best
really
caused
a
dissension
among
the
young
people
who
were
of
about
the
same
age
and
the
occasioned
serious
battles
for
there
was
almost
as
much
fighting
with
words
as
with
swords
and
to
decide
the
matter
in
the
end
a
trial
of
skill
between
the
two
teachers
was
arranged
the
consequences
of
which
i
need
not
circumstantially
describe
the
german
stood
in
his
position
like
a
wall
watched
his
opportunity
and
contrived
to
disarm
his
opponent
over
and
over
again
with
his
cut
and
thrust
the
latter
maintained
that
this
mattered
not
and
proceeded
to
exhaust
the
other
wind
by
his
agility
he
fetched
the
german
several
lunges
too
which
however
if
they
had
been
in
earnest
would
have
sent
himself
into
the
next
world
on
the
whole
nothing
was
decided
or
improved
except
that
some
went
over
to
our
countryman
of
whom
i
was
one
but
i
had
already
acquired
too
much
from
the
first
master
and
hence
a
considerable
time
elapsed
before
the
new
one
could
break
me
of
it
who
was
altogether
less
satisfied
with
us
renegades
than
with
his
original
pupils
as
to
riding
it
fared
still
worse
with
me
it
happened
that
they
sent
me
to
the
course
in
the
autumn
so
that
i
commenced
in
the
cool
and
damp
season
the
pedantic
treatment
of
this
noble
art
was
highly
repugnant
to
me
from
first
to
last
the
whole
talk
was
about
sitting
the
horse
and
yet
no
one
could
say
in
what
a
proper
sitting
consisted
though
all
depended
on
that
for
they
went
to
and
fro
on
the
stirrups
moreover
the
instruction
seemed
contrived
only
for
cheating
and
degrading
the
scholars
if
one
forgot
to
hook
or
loosen
the
or
let
his
switch
fall
down
or
even
his
hat
every
delay
every
misfortune
had
to
be
atoned
for
by
money
and
one
was
even
laughed
at
besides
this
put
me
in
the
worst
of
humours
particularly
when
i
found
the
place
of
exercise
itself
quite
intolerable
the
great
nasty
space
either
wet
or
dusty
the
cold
the
mouldy
smell
all
together
was
in
the
highest
degree
repugnant
to
me
and
since
the
always
gave
the
others
the
best
and
me
the
worst
horses
to
ride
perhaps
because
they
bribed
him
by
breakfasts
and
other
gifts
or
even
by
their
own
cleverness
since
he
kept
me
waiting
and
as
it
seemed
slighted
me
i
spent
the
most
disagreeable
hours
in
an
employment
that
ought
to
have
been
the
most
pleasant
in
the
world
nay
the
impression
of
that
time
and
of
these
circumstances
has
remained
with
me
so
vividly
that
although
i
afterwards
became
a
passionate
and
daring
rider
and
for
days
and
weeks
together
scarcely
got
off
my
horse
i
carefully
shunned
covered
and
at
least
passed
only
a
few
moments
in
them
the
case
often
happens
that
when
the
elements
of
an
exclusive
art
are
taught
us
this
is
done
in
a
painful
and
revolting
manner
the
conviction
that
this
is
both
wearisome
and
injurious
has
given
rise
in
later
times
to
the
educational
maxim
that
the
young
must
be
taught
everything
in
an
easy
cheerful
and
agreeable
way
from
which
however
other
evils
and
disadvantages
have
proceeded
with
the
approach
of
spring
times
became
again
more
quiet
with
us
and
if
in
earlier
days
i
had
endeavoured
to
obtain
a
sight
of
the
city
its
ecclesiastical
civil
public
and
private
structures
and
especially
found
great
delight
in
the
still
prevailing
antiquities
i
afterwards
endeavoured
by
means
of
lersner
and
other
frankfortian
books
and
pamphlets
belonging
to
my
father
to
revive
the
persons
of
past
times
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
well
attained
by
great
attention
to
the
peculiarities
of
times
and
manners
and
of
distinguished
individuals
the
rebel
fettmilch
among
the
ancient
remains
that
which
from
my
childhood
had
been
remarkable
to
me
was
the
skull
of
a
state
criminal
fastened
up
on
the
tower
of
the
bridge
who
out
of
three
or
four
as
the
naked
iron
spikes
showed
had
since
been
preserved
in
spite
of
the
encroachments
of
time
and
weather
whenever
one
returned
from
sachsenhausen
to
frankfort
one
had
this
tower
before
one
and
the
skull
was
directly
in
view
as
a
boy
i
liked
to
hear
related
the
history
of
these
rebels
fettmilch
and
his
confederates
how
they
had
become
dissatisfied
with
the
government
of
the
city
had
risen
up
against
it
plotted
a
mutiny
plundered
the
jews
quarter
and
excited
a
fearful
riot
but
were
at
last
captured
and
condemned
to
death
by
a
deputy
of
the
emperor
afterwards
i
felt
anxious
to
know
the
most
minute
circumstance
and
to
hear
what
sort
of
people
they
were
when
from
an
old
contemporary
book
ornamented
with
woodcuts
i
learned
that
while
these
men
had
indeed
been
condemned
to
death
many
councillors
had
at
the
same
time
been
deposed
because
various
kinds
of
disorder
and
very
much
that
was
unwarrantable
was
then
going
on
when
i
heard
the
nearer
particulars
now
all
took
place
i
pitied
the
unfortunate
persons
who
might
be
regarded
as
sacrifices
made
for
a
future
better
constitution
for
from
that
time
was
dated
the
regulation
which
allows
the
noble
old
house
of
limpurg
the
sprung
from
a
club
besides
lawyers
tradespeople
and
artisans
to
take
a
part
in
a
government
which
completed
by
a
system
of
ballot
complicated
in
the
venetian
fashion
and
restricted
by
the
civil
colleges
was
called
to
do
right
without
acquiring
any
special
privilege
to
do
wrong
among
the
things
which
excited
the
misgivings
of
the
boy
and
even
of
the
youth
was
especially
the
state
of
the
jewish
quarter
of
the
city
properly
called
the
as
it
consisted
of
little
more
than
a
single
street
which
in
early
times
may
have
been
hemmed
in
between
the
walls
and
trenches
of
the
town
as
in
a
prison
the
closeness
the
filth
the
crowd
the
accent
of
an
unpleasant
language
altogether
made
a
most
disagreeable
impression
even
if
one
only
looked
in
as
one
passed
the
gate
it
was
long
before
i
ventured
in
alone
and
i
did
not
return
there
readily
when
i
had
once
escaped
the
importunities
of
so
many
men
unwearied
in
demanding
and
offering
to
traffic
at
the
same
time
the
old
legends
of
the
cruelty
of
the
jews
towards
christian
children
which
we
had
seen
hideously
illustrated
in
gottfried
hovered
gloomily
before
my
young
mind
and
although
they
were
thought
better
of
in
modern
times
the
large
caricature
still
to
be
seen
to
their
disgrace
on
an
arched
wall
under
the
bridge
tower
bore
extraordinary
witness
against
them
for
it
had
been
made
not
through
private
but
by
public
order
however
they
still
remained
nevertheless
the
chosen
people
of
god
and
passed
no
matter
how
it
came
about
as
a
memorial
of
the
most
ancient
times
besides
they
also
were
men
active
and
obliging
and
even
to
the
tenacity
with
which
they
clung
to
their
peculiar
customs
one
could
not
refuse
one
respect
the
girls
moreover
were
pretty
and
were
far
from
displeased
when
a
christian
lad
meeting
them
on
the
sabbath
in
the
fischerfeld
showed
himself
kindly
and
attentive
i
was
consequently
extremely
curious
to
become
acquainted
with
their
ceremonies
i
did
not
desist
until
i
had
frequently
visited
their
school
had
assisted
at
a
circumcision
and
a
wedding
and
had
formed
a
notion
of
the
feast
of
the
tabernacles
everywhere
i
was
well
received
pleasantly
entertained
and
invited
to
come
again
for
they
were
persons
of
influence
by
whom
i
had
been
either
introduced
or
recommended
public
burning
of
a
book
thus
as
a
young
resident
in
a
large
city
i
was
thrown
about
from
one
object
to
another
and
horrible
scenes
were
not
wanting
in
the
midst
of
the
municipal
quiet
and
security
sometimes
a
more
or
less
remote
fire
aroused
us
from
our
domestic
peace
sometimes
the
discovery
of
a
great
crime
with
its
investigation
and
punishment
set
the
whole
city
in
an
uproar
for
many
weeks
we
were
forced
to
be
witnesses
of
different
executions
and
it
is
worth
remembering
that
i
was
also
once
present
at
the
burning
of
a
book
the
publication
was
a
french
comic
romance
which
indeed
spared
the
state
but
not
religion
and
manners
there
was
really
something
dreadful
in
seeing
punishment
inflicted
on
a
lifeless
thing
the
packages
burst
asunder
in
the
fire
and
were
raked
apart
by
an
to
be
brought
in
closer
contact
with
the
flames
it
was
not
long
before
the
kindled
sheets
were
wafted
about
in
the
air
and
the
crowd
caught
at
them
with
eagerness
nor
could
we
rest
until
we
had
hunted
up
a
copy
while
not
a
few
managed
likewise
to
procure
the
forbidden
pleasure
nay
if
it
had
been
done
to
give
the
author
publicity
he
could
not
himself
have
made
a
more
effectual
provision
but
there
were
also
more
peaceable
inducements
which
took
me
about
in
every
part
of
the
city
my
father
had
early
accustomed
me
to
manage
for
him
his
little
affairs
of
business
he
charged
me
particularly
to
stir
up
the
labourers
whom
he
set
to
work
as
they
commonly
kept
him
waiting
longer
than
was
proper
because
he
wished
everything
done
accurately
and
was
used
in
the
end
to
lower
the
price
for
a
prompt
payment
in
this
way
i
gained
access
to
all
the
workshops
and
as
it
was
natural
to
me
to
enter
into
the
condition
of
others
to
feel
every
species
of
human
existence
and
sympathize
in
it
with
pleasure
these
commissions
were
to
me
the
occasion
of
many
most
delightful
hours
and
i
learned
to
know
every
one
method
of
proceeding
and
what
joy
and
sorrow
what
advantages
and
hardships
were
incident
to
the
indispensable
conditions
of
this
or
that
mode
of
life
i
was
thus
brought
nearer
to
that
active
class
which
connects
the
lower
and
upper
classes
for
if
on
the
one
side
stand
those
who
are
employed
in
the
simple
and
rude
products
and
on
the
other
those
who
desire
to
enjoy
something
that
has
been
already
worked
up
the
manufacturer
with
his
skill
and
hand
is
the
mediator
through
whom
the
other
two
receive
something
from
each
other
each
is
enabled
to
gratify
his
wishes
in
his
own
way
the
household
economy
of
many
crafts
which
took
its
form
and
colour
from
the
occupation
was
likewise
an
object
of
my
quiet
attention
and
thus
was
developed
and
strengthened
in
me
the
feeling
of
the
equality
if
not
of
all
men
yet
of
all
human
conditions
the
mere
fact
of
existence
seeming
to
me
the
main
point
and
all
the
rest
indifferent
and
accidental
as
my
father
did
not
readily
allow
himself
an
expense
which
would
be
at
once
consumed
in
a
momentary
enjoyment
as
i
can
scarcely
call
to
mind
that
we
ever
took
a
walk
together
and
spent
anything
in
a
place
of
amusement
he
was
on
the
other
hand
not
niggardly
in
procuring
such
things
as
had
a
good
external
appearance
in
addition
to
inward
value
no
one
could
desire
peace
more
than
he
although
he
had
not
felt
the
smallest
inconvenience
during
the
last
days
of
the
war
with
this
feeling
he
had
promised
my
mother
a
gold
snuffbox
set
with
diamonds
which
she
was
to
receive
as
soon
as
peace
should
be
publicly
declared
in
the
expectation
of
the
happy
event
they
had
laboured
now
for
some
years
on
this
present
the
box
which
was
tolerably
large
had
been
executed
in
hanau
for
my
father
was
on
good
terms
with
the
there
as
well
as
with
the
heads
of
the
silk
establishments
many
designs
were
made
for
it
the
cover
was
adorned
by
a
basket
of
flowers
over
which
hovered
a
dove
with
the
a
vacant
space
was
left
for
the
jewels
which
were
to
be
set
partly
in
the
dove
and
partly
on
the
spot
where
the
box
is
usually
opened
the
jeweller
to
whom
the
execution
and
the
requisite
stones
were
entrusted
was
named
lautensak
and
was
a
brisk
skilful
man
who
like
many
artists
seldom
did
what
was
necessary
but
usually
works
of
caprice
which
gave
him
pleasure
the
jewels
were
very
soon
set
in
the
shape
in
which
they
were
to
be
put
upon
the
box
on
some
black
wax
and
looked
very
well
but
they
would
not
come
off
to
be
transferred
to
the
gold
in
the
outset
my
father
let
the
matter
rest
but
as
the
hope
of
peace
became
livelier
and
finally
when
the
stipulations
particularly
the
elevation
of
the
archduke
joseph
to
the
roman
throne
seemed
more
precisely
known
he
grew
more
and
more
impatient
and
i
had
to
go
several
times
a
week
nay
at
last
almost
daily
to
visit
the
tardy
artist
by
means
of
my
unremitted
teazing
and
exhortation
the
work
went
on
though
slowly
enough
for
as
it
was
of
that
kind
which
can
be
taken
in
hand
or
laid
aside
at
will
there
was
always
something
by
which
it
was
thrust
out
of
the
way
and
put
aside
lautensak
bouquet
the
chief
cause
of
this
conduct
however
was
a
task
which
the
artist
had
undertaken
on
his
own
account
everybody
knew
that
the
emperor
francis
cherished
a
strong
liking
for
jewels
and
especially
for
coloured
stones
lautensak
had
expended
a
considerable
sum
and
as
it
afterwards
turned
out
larger
than
his
means
on
such
gems
out
of
which
he
had
begun
to
shape
a
nosegay
in
which
every
stone
was
to
be
tastefully
disposed
according
to
its
shape
and
colour
and
the
whole
form
a
work
of
art
worthy
to
stand
in
the
of
an
emperor
he
had
in
his
desultory
way
laboured
for
many
years
upon
it
and
now
hastened
because
after
the
peace
the
arrival
of
the
emperor
for
the
coronation
of
his
son
was
expected
in
frankfort
to
complete
it
and
finally
to
put
it
together
my
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
such
things
he
used
very
dexterously
in
order
to
distract
me
as
a
bearer
of
threats
and
to
lead
me
away
from
my
intention
he
strove
to
impart
a
knowledge
of
these
stones
to
me
and
made
me
attentive
to
their
properties
and
value
so
in
the
end
i
knew
his
whole
bouquet
by
heart
and
quite
as
well
as
he
could
have
demonstrated
its
virtues
to
a
customer
it
is
even
now
before
me
and
i
have
since
seen
more
costly
but
not
more
graceful
specimens
of
show
and
magnificence
in
this
sort
he
possessed
moreover
a
pretty
collection
of
engravings
and
other
works
of
art
with
which
he
liked
to
amuse
himself
and
i
passed
many
hours
with
him
not
without
profit
finally
when
the
congress
of
hubertsburg
was
finally
fixed
he
did
for
my
sake
more
than
was
due
and
the
dove
and
flowers
actually
reached
my
mother
hands
on
the
festival
in
celebration
of
the
peace
i
then
received
also
many
similar
commissions
to
urge
on
painters
with
respect
to
pictures
which
had
been
ordered
my
father
had
confirmed
himself
in
the
notion
and
few
men
were
free
from
it
that
a
picture
painted
on
wood
was
greatly
to
be
preferred
to
one
that
was
merely
put
on
canvas
it
was
therefore
his
great
care
to
possess
good
oak
boards
of
every
shape
because
he
well
knew
that
just
on
this
important
point
the
more
careless
artists
trusted
to
the
joiners
the
oldest
planks
were
hunted
up
the
joiners
were
obliged
to
go
accurately
to
work
with
gluing
painting
and
arranging
and
they
were
then
kept
for
years
in
an
upper
room
where
they
could
be
sufficiently
dried
a
precious
board
of
this
kind
was
intrusted
to
the
painter
junker
who
was
to
represent
on
it
an
ornamental
with
the
most
important
flowers
drawn
after
nature
in
his
artistic
and
elegant
manner
it
was
just
about
the
and
i
did
not
fail
to
take
him
several
times
a
week
the
most
beautiful
flowers
that
fell
in
my
way
which
he
immediately
put
in
and
by
degrees
composed
the
whole
out
of
these
elements
with
the
utmost
care
and
fidelity
on
one
occasion
i
had
caught
a
mouse
which
i
took
to
him
and
which
he
desired
to
copy
as
a
very
pretty
animal
nay
really
represented
it
as
accurately
as
possible
gnawing
an
ear
of
corn
at
the
foot
of
the
many
such
inoffensive
natural
objects
such
as
butterflies
and
chafers
were
brought
in
and
represented
so
that
finally
as
far
as
imitation
and
execution
were
concerned
a
highly
valuable
picture
was
put
together
hence
i
was
not
a
little
astonished
when
the
good
man
formally
declared
one
day
when
the
work
was
just
about
to
be
delivered
that
the
picture
no
longer
pleased
him
since
while
it
had
turned
out
quite
well
in
its
details
it
was
not
well
composed
as
a
whole
because
it
had
been
produced
in
this
gradual
manner
and
he
had
perpetrated
a
blunder
in
the
outset
in
not
at
least
devising
a
general
plan
for
light
and
shade
as
well
as
for
colour
according
to
which
the
single
flowers
might
have
been
arranged
he
examined
with
me
the
minutest
parts
of
the
picture
which
had
arisen
before
my
eyes
during
a
half
year
and
had
in
many
respects
pleased
me
and
managed
to
convince
me
perfectly
much
to
my
regret
even
the
copy
of
the
mouse
he
regarded
as
a
mistake
for
many
persons
he
said
have
a
sort
of
horror
of
such
animals
and
they
should
not
be
introduced
where
the
object
is
to
excite
pleasure
as
it
commonly
happens
with
those
who
are
cured
of
a
prejudice
and
imagine
themselves
much
more
knowing
than
they
were
before
i
now
had
a
real
contempt
for
this
work
of
art
and
agreed
perfectly
with
the
artist
when
he
caused
to
be
prepared
another
tablet
of
the
same
size
on
which
according
to
his
taste
he
painted
a
better
formed
vessel
and
a
more
artistically
arranged
nosegay
and
also
managed
to
select
and
distribute
the
little
living
accessories
in
an
ornamental
and
agreeable
way
this
tablet
also
he
painted
with
the
greatest
care
though
altogether
after
the
former
copied
one
or
from
memory
which
through
a
very
long
and
assiduous
practice
came
to
his
aid
both
paintings
were
now
ready
and
we
were
thoroughly
delighted
with
the
last
which
was
certainly
the
more
artistic
and
striking
of
the
two
my
father
was
surprised
with
two
pictures
instead
of
one
and
to
him
the
choice
was
left
he
approved
of
our
opinion
and
of
the
reasons
for
it
and
especially
of
our
and
activity
but
after
considering
both
pictures
some
days
decided
in
favour
of
the
first
without
saying
much
about
the
motives
of
his
choice
the
artist
in
an
took
back
his
second
picture
and
could
not
refrain
from
the
remark
that
the
good
oaken
tablet
on
which
the
first
was
painted
had
certainly
its
effect
on
my
father
decision
factory
now
i
am
again
speaking
of
painting
i
am
reminded
of
a
large
establishment
where
i
passed
much
time
because
both
it
and
its
managers
especially
attracted
me
it
was
the
great
factory
which
the
painter
nothnagel
had
erected
an
expert
artist
but
one
who
by
his
mode
of
thought
inclined
more
to
manufacture
than
to
art
in
a
very
large
space
of
courts
and
gardens
all
sorts
of
were
made
from
the
coarsest
that
are
spread
with
a
trowel
and
used
for
and
similar
purposes
and
the
carpets
impressed
with
figures
to
the
finer
and
the
finest
on
which
sometimes
chinese
and
grotesque
sometimes
natural
flowers
sometimes
figures
sometimes
landscapes
were
represented
by
the
pencils
of
accomplished
workmen
this
multiplicity
to
which
there
was
no
end
amused
me
vastly
the
occupation
of
so
many
men
from
the
commonest
labour
to
that
in
which
a
certain
artistic
worth
could
not
be
denied
was
to
me
extremely
attractive
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
this
multitude
of
younger
and
older
men
working
in
several
rooms
one
behind
the
other
and
occasionally
lent
a
hand
myself
the
sale
of
these
commodities
was
extraordinarily
brisk
whoever
at
that
time
was
building
or
furnishing
a
house
wished
to
provide
for
his
lifetime
and
this
carpeting
was
certainly
quite
indestructible
nothnagel
had
enough
to
do
in
managing
the
whole
and
sat
in
his
office
surrounded
by
factors
and
clerks
the
remainder
of
his
time
he
employed
in
his
collection
of
works
of
art
consisting
chiefly
of
engravings
in
which
as
well
as
in
the
pictures
he
possessed
he
traded
occasionally
at
the
same
time
he
had
acquired
a
taste
for
etching
he
etched
a
variety
of
plates
and
prosecuted
this
branch
of
art
even
into
his
latest
years
as
his
dwelling
lay
near
the
eschenheim
gate
my
way
when
i
had
visited
him
led
me
out
of
the
city
to
some
pieces
of
ground
which
my
father
owned
beyond
the
gates
one
was
a
large
orchard
the
soil
of
which
was
used
as
a
meadow
and
in
which
my
father
carefully
attended
the
transplanting
of
trees
and
whatever
else
pertained
to
their
preservation
though
the
ground
itself
was
leased
still
more
occupation
was
furnished
by
a
very
vineyard
beyond
the
friedberg
gate
where
between
the
rows
of
vines
rows
of
asparagus
were
planted
and
tended
with
great
care
scarcely
a
day
passed
in
the
fine
season
in
which
my
father
did
not
go
there
and
as
on
these
occasions
we
might
generally
accompany
him
we
were
provided
with
joy
and
delight
from
the
earliest
productions
of
spring
to
the
last
of
autumn
we
also
learned
to
occupy
ourselves
with
gardening
matters
which
as
they
were
repeated
every
year
became
in
the
end
perfectly
known
and
familiar
to
us
but
after
the
manifold
fruits
of
summer
and
autumn
the
vintage
at
last
was
the
most
lively
and
the
most
desirable
nay
there
is
no
question
that
as
wine
gives
a
freer
character
to
the
very
places
and
districts
where
it
is
grown
and
drunk
so
also
do
these
while
they
close
summer
and
at
the
same
time
open
the
winter
diffuse
an
incredible
cheerfulness
joy
and
jubilation
pervade
a
whole
district
in
the
daytime
huzzas
and
shoutings
are
heard
from
every
end
and
corner
and
at
night
rockets
and
now
here
now
there
announce
that
the
people
everywhere
awake
and
lively
would
willingly
make
this
festival
last
as
long
as
possible
the
subsequent
labour
at
the
and
during
the
fermentation
in
the
cellar
gave
us
also
a
cheerful
employment
at
home
and
thus
we
ordinarily
reached
winter
without
being
properly
aware
of
it
these
rural
possessions
delighted
us
so
much
the
more
in
the
spring
of
as
the
of
february
in
that
year
was
celebrated
as
a
festival
day
on
account
of
the
conclusion
of
the
hubertsberg
peace
under
the
happy
results
of
which
the
greater
part
of
my
life
was
to
flow
away
but
before
i
go
further
i
think
i
am
bound
to
mention
some
men
who
exerted
an
important
influence
on
my
youth
frankfort

he
could
well
have
personated
the
most
important
french
prelate
after
his
academical
course
he
had
employed
himself
in
political
and
state
affairs
and
directed
even
his
travels
to
that
end
he
greatly
esteemed
me
and
often
conversed
with
me
on
matters
which
chiefly
interested
him
i
was
with
him
when
he
wrote
his
of
the
golden
when
he
managed
to
explain
to
me
very
clearly
the
worth
and
dignity
of
that
document
my
imagination
was
led
back
by
it
to
those
wild
and
unquiet
times
so
that
i
could
not
forbear
representing
what
he
related
historically
as
if
it
were
present
by
pictures
of
characters
and
circumstances
and
often
by
mimicry
in
this
he
took
great
delight
and
by
his
applause
excited
me
to
repetition
i
had
from
childhood
the
singular
habit
of
always
learning
by
heart
the
beginnings
of
books
and
the
divisions
of
a
work

of
the
five
books

and
then

now
did
the

provoked

unexpectedly

at

such
words
published

when
they
wished
to
soften
his
peevish
humour
and
persuade
him
to
any
diversion
he
now
really
rode
out
with
us
many
times
and
again
contemplated
the
country
on
which
he
had
not
cast
an
eye
for
so
many
years
he
called
to
mind
the
old
landowners
and
told
stones
of
their
characters
and
actions
in
which
he
showed
himself
always
severe
but
often
cheerful
and
witty
we
now
tried
also
to
bring
him
again
among
other
men
which
however
nearly
turned
out
badly
about
the
same
age
if
indeed
not
older
was
one
herr
von
malapert
a
rich
man
who
possessed
a
very
handsome
house
by
the
and
derived
a
good
income
from
he
also
lived
quite
secluded
but
in
summer
he
was
a
great
deal
in
his
garden
near
the
bockenheim
gate
where
he
watched
and
tended
a
very
fine
plot
of
pinks
von
reineck
was
likewise
an
amateur
of
pinks
the
season
of
flowering
had
come
and
suggestions
were
made
as
to
whether
these
two
could
not
visit
each
other
we
introduced
the
matter
and
persisted
in
it
till
at
last
von
reineck
resolved
to
go
out
with
us
one
sunday
afternoon
the
greeting
of
the
two
old
gentlemen
was
very
laconic
indeed
almost
pantomimic
and
they
walked
up
and
down
by
the
long
pink
frames
with
true
diplomatic
strides
the
display
was
really
extraordinarily
beautiful
and
the
particular
forms
and
colours
of
the
different
flowers
the
advantages
of
one
over
the
other
and
their
rarity
gave
at
last
occasion
to
a
sort
of
conversation
which
appeared
to
get
quite
friendly
at
which
we
others
rejoiced
the
more
because
we
saw
the
most
precious
old
rhine
wine
in
cut
decanters
fine
fruits
and
other
good
things
spread
upon
a
table
in
a
neighbouring
bower
but
these
alas
we
were
not
to
enjoy
for
von
reineck
unfortunately
saw
a
very
fine
pink
with
its
head
somewhat
hanging
down
he
therefore
took
the
stalk
near
the
calyx
very
cautiously
between
his
fore
and
middle
fingers
and
lifted
the
flower
so
that
he
could
well
inspect
it
but
even
this
gentle
handling
vexed
the
owner
von
malapert
courteously
indeed
but
stiffly
enough
and
somewhat
reminded
him
of
the
non
von
reineck
had
already
let
go
the
flower
but
at
once
took
fire
at
the
words
and
said
in
his
usual
dry
serious
manner
that
it
was
quite
consistent
with
an
amateur
to
touch
and
examine
them
in
such
a
manner
whereupon
he
repeated
the
act
and
took
the
flower
again
between
his
fingers
the
friends
of
both
parties
for
von
malapert
also
had
one
present
were
now
in
the
greatest
perplexity
they
set
one
hare
to
catch
another
that
was
our
proverbial
expression
when
a
conversation
was
to
be
interrupted
and
turned
to
another
subject
but
it
would
not
do
the
old
gentleman
had
become
quite
silent
and
we
feared
every
moment
that
von
reineck
would
repeat
the
act
when
it
would
be
all
over
with
us
the
two
friends
kept
their
principals
apart
by
occupying
them
now
here
now
there
and
at
last
we
found
it
most
expedient
to
make
preparation
for
departure
thus
alas
we
were
forced
to
turn
our
backs
on
the
inviting
yet
unenjoyed
frankfort
characters
hofrath
huisgen
hofrath
huisgen
not
born
in
frankfort
of
the
reformed
religion
and
therefore
incapable
of
public
office
including
the
profession
of
advocate
which
however
because
much
confidence
was
placed
in
him
as
an
excellent
jurist
he
managed
to
exercise
quietly
both
in
the
frankfort
and
the
imperial
courts
under
assumed
signatures
was
already
sixty
years
old
when
i
took
writing
lessons
with
his
son
and
so
came
into
his
house
his
figure
was
tall
without
being
thin
and
broad
without
corpulency
you
could
not
look
for
the
first
time
on
his
face
which
was
not
only
disfigured
by
smallpox
but
deprived
of
an
eye
without
apprehension
he
always
wore
on
his
bald
head
a
perfectly
white
cap
tied
at
the
top
with
a
ribbon
his
of
calamanco
or
damask
were
always
very
clean
he
dwelt
in
a
very
cheerful
suite
of
rooms
on
the
by
the
and
the
neatness
of
everything
about
him
corresponded
with
this
cheerfulness
the
perfect
arrangement
of
his
papers
books
and
maps
produced
a
favourable
impression
his
son
heinrich
sebastian
afterwards
known
by
various
writings
on
art
gave
little
promise
in
his
youth
but
dull
not
rude
but
blunt
and
without
any
special
liking
for
instruction
he
rather
sought
to
avoid
the
presence
of
his
father
as
he
could
get
all
he
wanted
from
his
mother
i
on
the
other
hand
grew
more
and
more
intimate
with
the
old
man
the
more
i
knew
of
him
as
he
attended
only
to
important
cases
he
had
time
enough
to
occupy
and
amuse
himself
in
another
manner
i
had
not
long
frequented
his
house
and
heard
his
doctrines
than
i
could
well
perceive
that
he
stood
in
opposition
to
god
and
the
world
one
of
his
favourite
books
was
de
vanitate
which
he
especially
commended
to
me
and
so
set
my
young
brains
in
a
considerable
whirl
for
a
long
time
in
the
happiness
of
youth
i
was
inclined
to
a
sort
of
optimism
and
had
again
pretty
well
reconciled
myself
with
god
or
the
gods
for
the
experience
of
a
series
of
years
had
taught
me
that
there
was
much
to
counterbalance
evil
that
one
can
well
recover
from
misfortune
and
that
one
may
be
saved
from
dangers
and
need
not
always
break
one
neck
i
looked
with
tolerance
too
on
what
men
did
and
pursued
and
found
many
things
worthy
of
praise
which
my
old
gentleman
could
not
by
any
means
abide
indeed
once
when
he
had
sketched
the
world
to
me
rather
from
the
distorted
side
i
observed
from
his
appearance
that
he
meant
to
close
the
game
with
an
important
he
shut
tight
his
blind
left
eye
as
he
was
wont
to
do
in
such
cases
looked
sharp
out
of
the
other
and
said
in
a
nasal
voice
even
in
god
i
discover
defects
my
timonic
mentor
was
also
a
mathematician
but
his
practical
turn
drove
him
to
mechanics
though
he
did
not
work
himself
a
clock
wonderful
indeed
in
those
days
which
indicated
not
only
the
days
and
hours
but
the
motions
of
the
sun
and
moon
he
caused
to
be
made
according
to
his
own
plan
on
sunday
about
ten
in
the
morning
he
always
wound
it
up
himself
which
he
could
do
the
more
regularly
as
he
never
went
to
church
i
never
saw
company
nor
guests
at
his
house
and
only
twice
in
ten
years
do
i
remember
to
have
seen
him
dressed
and
walking
out
of
doors
my
various
conversations
with
these
men
were
not
insignificant
and
each
of
them
influenced
me
in
his
own
way
from
every
one
i
had
as
much
attention
as
his
own
children
if
not
more
and
each
strove
to
increase
his
delight
in
me
as
in
a
beloved
son
while
he
aspired
to
mould
me
into
his
moral
counterpart
olenschlager
would
have
made
me
a
courtier
von
reineck
a
diplomatic
man
of
business
both
the
latter
particularly
sought
to
disgust
me
with
poetry
and
authorship
huisgen
wished
me
to
be
a
timon
after
his
fashion
but
at
the
same
time
an
able
a
necessary
profession
as
he
thought
with
which
one
could
in
a
regular
manner
defend
oneself
and
friends
against
the
rabble
of
mankind
succour
the
oppressed
and
above
all
pay
off
a
rogue
though
the
last
is
neither
especially
practicable
nor
advisable
but
if
i
liked
to
be
at
the
side
of
these
men
to
profit
by
their
counsels
and
directions
younger
persons
only
a
little
older
than
myself
roused
me
to
immediate
emulation
i
name
here
before
all
others
the
brothers
schlosser
and
griesbach
but
as
i
came
subsequently
into
a
more
intimate
connexion
with
these
which
lasted
for
many
years
uninterruptedly
i
will
only
say
for
the
present
that
they
were
then
praised
as
being
distinguished
in
languages
and
other
studies
which
opened
the
academical
course
and
held
up
as
models
and
that
everybody
cherished
the
certain
expectation
that
they
would
once
do
something
uncommon
in
church
and
state
with
respect
to
myself
i
also
had
it
in
my
mind
to
produce
something
extraordinary
but
in
what
it
was
to
consist
was
not
clear
but
as
we
are
apt
to
think
rather
upon
the
reward
which
may
be
received
than
upon
the
merit
which
is
to
be
acquired
so
i
do
not
deny
that
if
i
thought
of
a
desirable
piece
of
good
fortune
it
appeared
to
me
most
fascinating
in
the
shape
of
that
laurel
garland
which
is
woven
to
adorn
the
poet
the
names
of
the
sharp
notes
in
german
terminate
in
is
and
hence
f
and
g
sharp
are
called
fis
and
gis
these
are
the
technical
names
for
classes
of
accents
in
the
hebrew
it
should
be
observed
that
in
this
biblical
narrative
when
we
have
used
the
expressions
deity
godhead
or
divinity
goethe
generally
has

or

not
that
is
to
say
he
was
a
calvinist
as

from

its

and

and

in
a
way
peculiar
to
himself
nature
education
circumstances
and
habit
kept
me
apart
from
all
that
was
rude
and
though
i
often
came
into
contact
with
the
lower
classes
of
people
particularly
mechanics
no
close
connexion
grew
out
of
it
i
had
indeed
boldness
enough
to
undertake
something
uncommon
and
perhaps
dangerous
and
many
times
felt
disposed
to
do
so
but
i
was
without
the
handle
by
which
to
grasp
and
hold
it
meanwhile
i
was
quite
unexpectedly
involved
in
an
affair
which
brought
me
near
to
a
great
hazard
and
at
least
for
a
long
time
into
perplexity
and
distress
the
good
terms
on
which
i
before
stood
with
the
boy
whom
i
have
already
named
pylades
was
maintained
up
to
the
time
of
my
youth
we
indeed
saw
each
other
less
often
because
our
parents
did
not
stand
on
the
best
footing
with
each
other
but
when
we
did
meet
the
old
raptures
of
friendship
broke
out
immediately
once
we
met
in
the
alleys
which
offer
a
very
agreeable
walk
between
the
outer
and
inner
gate
of
saint
gallus
we
had
scarcely
returned
greetings
than
he
said
to
me
i
hold
to
the
same
opinion
as
ever
about
your
verses
those
which
you
recently
communicated
to
me
i
read
aloud
to
some
pleasant
companions
and
not
one
of
them
will
believe
that
you
have
made
them
let
it
pass
i
answered
we
will
make
them
and
enjoy
them
and
the
others
may
think
and
say
of
them
what
they
please
there
comes
the
unbeliever
now
added
my
friend
we
will
not
speak
of
it
i
replied
what
is
the
use
of
it
one
can
not
convert
them
by
no
means
said
my
friend
i
can
not
let
the
affair
pass
off
in
this
way
after
a
short
and
indifferent
conversation
my
young
comrade
who
was
but
too
well
disposed
towards
me
could
not
suffer
the
matter
to
drop
without
saying
to
the
other
with
some
resentment
here
is
my
friend
who
made
those
pretty
verses
for
which
you
will
not
give
him
credit
he
will
certainly
not
be
offended
at
that
answered
the
other
for
we
do
him
an
honour
when
we
suppose
that
more
learning
is
required
to
make
such
verses
than
one
of
his
years
can
possess
i
replied
with
something
indifferent
but
my
friend
continued
it
will
not
cost
much
labour
to
convince
you
give
him
any
theme
and
he
will
make
you
a
poem
on
the
spot
i
assented
we
were
agreed
and
the
other
asked
me
whether
i
would
venture
to
compose
a
pretty
in
rhyme
which
a
modest
young
woman
might
be
supposed
to
write
to
a
young
man
to
declare
her
inclination
nothing
is
easier
than
that
i
answered
if
i
only
had
writing
materials
he
pulled
out
his
pocket
almanac
in
which
there
were
a
great
many
blank
leaves
and
i
sat
down
upon
a
bench
to
write
they
walked
about
in
the
meanwhile
but
always
kept
me
in
sight
i
immediately
brought
the
required
situation
before
my
mind
and
thought
how
agreeable
it
must
be
if
some
pretty
girl
were
really
attached
to
me
and
would
reveal
her
sentiments
to
me
either
in
prose
or
verse
i
therefore
began
my
declaration
with
delight
and
in
a
little
while
executed
it
in
a
flowing
measure
between
doggerel
and
madrigal
with
the
greatest
possible
and
in
such
a
way
that
the
sceptic
was
overcome
with
admiration
and
my
friend
with
delight
the
request
of
the
former
to
possess
the
poem
i
could
the
less
refuse
as
it
in
his
almanac
and
i
willingly
saw
the
documentary
evidence
of
my
capabilities
in
his
hands
he
many
assurances
of
admiration
and
respect
and
wished
for
nothing
more
than
that
we
should
often
meet
so
we
settled
soon
to
go
together
into
the
country
our
party
actually
took
place
and
was
joined
by
several
more
young
people
of
the
same
rank
they
were
men
of
the
middle
or
if
you
please
of
the
lower
class
who
were
not
wanting
in
brains
and
who
moreover
as
they
had
gone
through
school
were
possessed
of
various
knowledge
and
a
certain
degree
of
culture
in
a
large
rich
city
there
are
many
modes
of
gaining
a
livelihood
these
got
on
by
copying
for
the
lawyers
and
by
advancing
the
children
of
the
lower
order
more
than
is
usual
in
common
schools
with
children
who
were
about
to
be
confirmed
they
went
through
the
religious
courses
then
again
they
assisted
factors
and
merchants
in
some
way
and
were
thus
enabled
to
enjoy
themselves
frugally
in
the
evenings
and
particularly
on
sundays
and
festivals
first
acquaintance
with
gretchen
on
the
way
there
while
they
highly
extolled
my
they
confessed
to
me
that
they
had
made
a
very
merry
use
of
it
that
it
had
been
copied
in
a
feigned
hand
and
with
a
few
pertinent
allusions
had
been
sent
to
a
conceited
young
man
who
was
now
firmly
persuaded
that
a
lady
to
whom
he
had
paid
distant
court
was
excessively
enamoured
of
him
and
sought
an
opportunity
for
closer
acquaintance
they
at
the
same
time
told
me
in
confidence
that
he
desired
nothing
more
now
than
to
be
able
to
answer
her
in
verse
but
that
neither
he
nor
they
were
skilful
enough
so
that
they
earnestly
solicited
me
to
compose
the
reply
mystifications
are
and
will
continue
to
be
an
amusement
for
idle
people
whether
more
or
less
ingenious
a
venial
wickedness
a
malice
is
an
enjoyment
for
those
who
have
neither
resources
in
themselves
nor
a
wholesome
external
activity
no
age
is
quite
exempt
from
such
pruriences
we
had
often
tricked
each
other
in
our
childish
years
many
sports
turn
upon
mystification
and
trick
the
present
jest
did
not
seem
to
me
to
go
further
i
gave
my
consent
they
imparted
to
me
many
particulars
which
the
letter
ought
to
contain
and
we
brought
it
home
already
finished
a
little
while
afterwards
i
was
urgently
invited
through
my
friend
to
take
part
in
one
of
the
evening
feasts
of
that
society
the
lover
he
said
was
willing
to
bear
the
expense
on
this
occasion
and
desired
expressly
to
thank
the
friend
who
had
shown
himself
so
excellent
a
poetical
secretary
we
came
together
late
enough
the
meal
was
most
frugal
the
wine
drinkable
while
as
for
the
conversation
it
turned
almost
entirely
on
jokes
upon
the
young
man
who
was
present
and
certainly
not
very
bright
and
who
after
repeated
readings
of
the
letter
almost
believed
that
he
had
written
it
himself
my
natural
would
not
allow
me
to
take
much
pleasure
in
such
a
malicious
deception
and
the
repetition
of
the
same
subject
soon
disgusted
me
i
should
certainly
have
passed
a
tedious
evening
if
an
unexpected
apparition
had
not
revived
me
on
our
arrival
the
table
had
already
been
neatly
and
orderly
covered
and
sufficient
wine
had
been
put
on
we
sat
down
and
remained
alone
without
requiring
further
service
as
there
was
however
a
want
of
wine
at
last
one
of
them
called
for
the
maid
but
instead
of
the
maid
there
came
in
a
girl
of
uncommon
and
when
one
saw
her
with
all
around
her
of
incredible
beauty
what
do
you
desire
she
asked
after
having
cordially
wished
us
a
good
evening
the
maid
is
ill
in
bed
can
i
serve
you
the
wine
is
out
said
one
if
you
would
fetch
us
a
few
bottles
it
would
be
very
kind
do
it
gretchen
said
another
it
is
but
a
cat
leap
from
here
why
not
she
answered
and
taking
a
few
empty
bottles
from
the
table
she
hastened
out
her
form
as
seen
from
behind
was
almost
more
elegant
the
little
cap
sat
so
neatly
upon
her
little
head
which
a
slender
throat
united
very
gracefully
to
her
neck
and
shoulders
everything
about
her
seemed
choice
and
one
could
survey
her
whole
form
the
more
at
ease
as
one
attention
was
no
more
exclusively
attracted
and
fettered
by
the
quiet
honest
eyes
and
lovely
mouth
i
reproved
my
comrades
for
sending
the
girl
out
alone
at
night
but
they
only
laughed
at
me
and
i
was
soon
consoled
by
her
return
as
the
publican
lived
only
just
across
the
way
sit
down
with
us
in
return
said
one
she
did
so
but
alas
she
did
not
come
near
me
she
drank
a
glass
to
our
health
and
speedily
departed
advising
us
not
to
stay
very
long
together
and
not
to
be
so
noisy
as
her
mother
was
just
going
to
bed
it
was
not
however
her
own
mother
but
the
mother
of
our
hosts
the
form
of
that
girl
followed
me
from
that
moment
on
every
path
it
was
the
first
durable
impression
which
a
female
being
had
made
upon
me
and
as
i
could
find
no
pretext
to
see
her
at
home
and
would
not
seek
one
i
went
to
church
for
love
of
her
and
had
soon
traced
out
where
she
sat
thus
during
the
long
protestant
service
i
gazed
my
fill
at
her
when
the
congregation
left
the
church
i
did
not
venture
to
accost
her
much
less
to
accompany
her
and
was
perfectly
delighted
if
she
seemed
to
have
remarked
me
and
to
have
returned
my
greeting
with
a
nod
yet
i
was
not
long
denied
the
happiness
of
approaching
her
they
had
persuaded
the
lover
whose
poetical
secretary
i
had
been
that
the
letter
written
in
his
name
had
been
actually
despatched
to
the
lady
and
had
strained
to
the
utmost
his
expectations
that
an
answer
must
soon
come
this
also
i
was
to
write
and
the
waggish
company
entreated
me
earnestly
through
pylades
to
exert
all
my
wit
and
employ
all
my
art
in
order
that
this
piece
might
be
quite
elegant
and
perfect
gretchen
advice
in
the
hope
of
again
seeing
my
fair
one
i
went
immediately
to
work
and
thought
of
everything
that
would
be
in
the
highest
degree
pleasing
if
gretchen
were
writing
it
to
me
i
imagined
i
had
written
out
everything
so
completely
from
her
form
her
nature
her
manner
and
her
mind
that
i
could
not
refrain
from
wishing
that
it
were
so
in
reality
and
lost
myself
in
rapture
at
the
mere
thought
that
something
similar
could
be
sent
from
her
to
me
thus
i
mystified
myself
while
i
intended
to
impose
upon
another
and
much
joy
and
much
trouble
was
yet
to
arise
out
of
the
affair
when
i
was
once
more
summoned
i
had
finished
promised
to
come
and
did
not
fail
at
the
appointed
hour
there
was
only
one
of
the
young
people
at
home
gretchen
sat
at
the
window
spinning
the
mother
was
going
to
and
fro
the
young
man
desired
that
i
should
read
it
over
to
him
i
did
so
and
read
not
without
emotion
as
i
glanced
over
the
paper
at
the
beautiful
girl
and
when
i
fancied
that
i
remarked
a
certain
uneasiness
in
her
deportment
and
a
gentle
flush
on
her
cheeks
i
uttered
better
and
with
more
animation
that
which
i
wished
to
hear
from
herself
the
cousin
who
had
often
interrupted
me
with
commendations
at
last
entreated
me
to
make
some
amendments
these
affected
some
passages
which
indeed
were
rather
suited
to
the
condition
of
gretchen
than
to
that
of
the
lady
who
was
of
a
good
family
wealthy
and
known
and
respected
in
the
city
after
the
young
man
had
designated
the
desired
changes
and
had
brought
me
an
inkstand
but
had
taken
leave
for
a
short
time
on
account
of
some
business
i
remained
sitting
on
the
bench
against
the
wall
behind
the
large
table
and
essayed
the
alterations
that
were
to
be
made
on
the
large
slate
which
almost
covered
the
whole
table
with
a
pencil
that
always
lay
in
the
window
because
upon
this
slate
reckonings
were
often
made
and
various
memoranda
noted
down
and
those
coming
in
or
going
out
even
communicated
with
each
other
i
had
for
written
different
things
and
rubbed
them
out
again
when
i
exclaimed
impatiently
it
will
not
do
so
much
the
better
said
the
dear
girl
in
a
grave
tone
i
wished
that
it
might
not
do
you
should
not
meddle
in
such
matters
she
arose
from
the
distaff
and
stepping
towards
the
table
gave
me
a
severe
lecture
with
a
great
deal
of
good
sense
and
kindliness
the
thing
seems
an
innocent
jest
it
is
a
jest
but
it
is
not
innocent
i
have
already
lived
to
see
several
cases
in
which
our
young
people
for
the
sake
of
such
mere
mischief
have
brought
themselves
into
great
difficulty
but
what
shall
i
do
i
asked
the
letter
is
written
and
they
rely
upon
me
to
alter
it
trust
me
she
replied
and
do
not
alter
it
nay
take
it
back
put
it
in
your
pocket
go
away
and
try
to
make
the
matter
straight
through
your
friend
i
will
also
put
in
a
word
for
look
you
though
i
am
a
poor
girl
and
dependent
upon
these
relations
who
indeed
do
nothing
bad
though
they
often
for
the
sake
of
sport
or
profit
undertake
a
good
deal
that
is
rash
i
have
resisted
them
and
would
not
copy
the
first
letter
as
they
requested
they
transcribed
it
in
a
feigned
hand
and
if
it
is
not
otherwise
so
may
they
also
do
with
this
and
you
a
young
man
of
good
family
rich
independent
why
will
you
allow
yourself
to
be
used
as
a
tool
in
a
business
which
can
certainly
bring
no
good
to
you
and
may
possibly
bring
much
that
is
unpleasant
i
was
glad
to
hear
her
speaking
thus
continuously
for
generally
she
introduced
but
few
words
into
conversation
my
liking
for
her
grew
incredibly
i
was
not
master
of
myself
and
replied
i
am
not
so
independent
as
you
suppose
and
of
what
use
is
wealth
to
me
when
the
most
precious
thing
i
can
desire
is
wanting
she
had
drawn
my
sketch
of
the
poetic
epistle
towards
her
and
read
it
half
aloud
in
a
sweet
and
graceful
manner
that
is
very
pretty
said
she
stopping
at
a
sort
of
point
but
it
is
a
pity
that
it
is
not
destined
for
a
real
purpose
that
were
indeed
very
desirable
i
cried
and
oh
how
happy
must
he
be
who
receives
from
a
girl
he
infinitely
loves
such
an
assurance
of
her
affection
there
is
much
required
for
that
she
answered
and
yet
many
things
are
possible
for
example
i
continued
if
any
one
who
knew
prized
honoured
and
adored
you
laid
such
a
paper
before
you
what
would
you
do
i
pushed
the
paper
nearer
to
her
which
she
had
previously
pushed
back
to
me
she
smiled
reflected
for
a
moment
took
the
pen
and
subscribed
her
name
i
was
beside
myself
with
rapture
sprang
up
and
would
have
embraced
her
no
kissing
said
she
that
is
so
vulgar
but
let
us
love
if
we
can
i
had
taken
up
the
paper
and
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
no
one
shall
ever
get
it
said
i
the
affair
is
closed
you
have
saved
me
now
complete
the
salvation
she
exclaimed
and
hurry
off
before
the
others
arrive
and
you
fall
into
trouble
and
embarrassment
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
from
her
but
she
asked
me
in
so
kindly
a
manner
while
she
took
my
right
hand
in
both
of
hers
and
lovingly
pressed
it
the
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
i
thought
hers
looked
moist
i
pressed
my
face
upon
her
hands
and
hastened
away
never
in
my
life
had
i
found
myself
in
such
perplexity
juvenile
love
the
first
propensities
to
love
in
an
uncorrupted
youth
take
altogether
a
spiritual
direction
nature
seems
to
desire
that
one
sex
may
by
the
senses
perceive
goodness
and
beauty
in
the
other
and
thus
to
me
by
the
sight
of
this
girl
by
my
strong
inclination
for
her
a
new
world
of
the
beautiful
and
the
excellent
had
arisen
i
read
my
poetical
epistle
a
hundred
times
through
gazed
upon
the
signature
kissed
it
pressed
it
to
my
heart
and
rejoiced
in
this
amiable
confession
but
the
more
my
transports
increased
the
more
did
it
pain
me
not
to
be
able
to
visit
her
immediately
and
to
see
and
converse
with
her
again
for
i
dreaded
the
reproofs
and
importunities
of
her
cousins
the
good
pylades
who
might
have
arranged
the
affair
i
could
not
contrive
to
meet
the
next
sunday
therefore
i
set
out
for
niederrad
where
these
associates
generally
used
to
go
and
actually
found
them
there
i
was
however
greatly
surprised
when
instead
of
behaving
in
a
cross
distant
manner
they
came
up
to
me
with
joyful
countenances
the
youngest
particularly
was
very
friendly
took
me
by
the
hand
and
said
you
have
lately
played
us
a
sorry
trick
and
we
were
very
angry
with
you
but
your
absconding
and
taking
away
the
poetical
epistle
has
suggested
a
good
thought
to
us
which
otherwise
might
never
have
occurred
by
way
of
atonement
you
may
treat
us
and
you
shall
learn
at
the
same
time
the
notion
we
have
which
will
certainly
give
you
pleasure
this
address
put
me
in
no
little
perplexity
for
i
had
about
me
only
money
enough
to
regale
myself
and
a
friend
but
to
treat
a
whole
company
and
especially
one
which
did
not
always
stop
at
the
right
time
i
was
by
no
means
prepared
nay
the
proposal
astonished
me
the
more
as
they
had
always
insisted
in
the
most
honourable
manner
that
each
one
should
pay
only
his
own
share
they
smiled
at
my
distress
and
the
youngest
proceeded
let
us
first
take
a
seat
in
the
bower
and
then
you
shall
learn
more
we
sat
down
and
he
said
when
you
had
taken
the
with
you
we
talked
the
whole
affair
over
again
and
came
to
a
conclusion
that
we
had
gratuitously
misused
your
talent
to
the
vexation
of
others
and
our
own
danger
for
the
sake
of
a
mere
paltry
love
of
mischief
when
we
could
have
employed
it
to
the
advantage
of
all
of
us
see
i
have
here
an
order
for
a
as
well
as
for
a
dirge
the
second
must
be
ready
immediately
the
other
can
wait
a
week
now
if
you
make
these
which
is
easy
for
you
you
will
treat
us
twice
and
we
shall
long
remain
your
debtors
this
proposition
pleased
me
in
every
respect
for
i
had
already
in
my
childhood
looked
with
a
certain
envy
on
the
occasional
poems
of
which
then
several
circulated
every
week
and
at
respectable
marriages
especially
came
to
light
by
the
dozen
because
i
thought
i
could
make
such
things
as
well
nay
better
than
others
now
an
opportunity
was
offered
me
to
show
myself
and
especially
to
see
myself
in
print
i
did
not
appear
disinclined
they
acquainted
me
with
the
personal
particulars
and
the
position
of
the
family
i
went
somewhat
aside
made
my
plan
and
produced
some
stanzas
however
when
i
returned
to
the
company
and
the
wine
was
not
spared
the
poem
began
to
halt
and
i
could
not
deliver
it
that
evening
there
is
still
time
till
evening
they
said
and
we
will
confess
to
you
that
the
fee
which
we
receive
for
the
dirge
is
enough
to
get
us
another
pleasant
evening
come
to
us
for
it
is
but
fair
that
gretchen
too
should
sup
with
us
as
it
was
she
properly
who
gave
us
the
notion
my
joy
was
unspeakable
on
my
way
home
i
had
only
the
remaining
stanzas
in
my
head
wrote
down
the
whole
before
i
went
to
sleep
and
the
next
morning
made
a
very
neat
fair
copy
the
day
seemed
infinitely
long
to
me
and
scarcely
was
it
dusk
than
i
found
myself
again
in
the
narrow
little
dwelling
beside
the
dearest
of
girls
gretchen
and
her
friends
the
young
persons
with
whom
in
this
way
i
formed
a
closer
and
closer
connexion
were
not
properly
low
but
ordinary
sort
of
people
their
activity
was
commendable
and
i
listened
to
them
with
pleasure
when
they
spoke
of
the
manifold
ways
and
means
by
which
one
could
gain
a
living
above
all
they
loved
to
tell
of
people
now
very
rich
who
had
begun
with
nothing
others
to
whom
they
referred
had
as
poor
clerks
rendered
themselves
indispensable
to
their
employers
and
had
finally
risen
to
be
their
while
others
had
so
enlarged
and
improved
a
little
trade
in
matches
and
the
like
that
they
were
now
prosperous
merchants
and
tradesmen
but
above
all
to
young
men
who
were
active
on
their
feet
the
trade
of
agent
and
factor
and
the
undertaking
of
all
sorts
of
commissions
and
charges
for
helpless
rich
men
was
they
said
a
most
profitable
means
of
gaining
a
livelihood
we
all
heard
this
eagerly
and
each
one
fancied
himself
somebody
when
he
imagined
at
the
moment
that
there
was
enough
in
him
not
only
to
get
on
in
the
world
but
to
acquire
an
extraordinary
fortune
but
no
one
seemed
to
carry
on
this
conversation
more
earnestly
than
pylades
who
at
last
confessed
that
he
had
an
extraordinary
passion
for
a
girl
and
was
actually
engaged
to
her
the
circumstances
of
his
parents
would
not
allow
him
to
go
to
universities
but
he
had
endeavoured
to
acquire
a
fine
handwriting
a
knowledge
of
accounts
and
the
modern
languages
and
would
now
do
his
best
in
hopes
of
attaining
that
domestic
felicity
the
cousins
praised
him
for
this
although
they
did
not
approve
of
a
premature
engagement
to
a
girl
and
they
added
that
while
forced
to
acknowledge
him
to
be
a
fine
good
fellow
they
did
not
consider
him
active
or
enterprising
enough
to
do
anything
extraordinary
while
he
in
vindication
of
himself
circumstantially
set
forth
what
he
thought
himself
fit
for
and
how
he
was
going
to
begin
the
others
were
also
incited
and
each
one
began
to
tell
what
he
was
now
able
to
do
doing
or
carrying
on
what
he
had
already
accomplished
and
what
he
saw
immediately
before
him
the
turn
at
last
came
to
me
i
was
to
set
forth
my
course
of
life
and
prospects
and
while
i
was
considering
pylades
said
i
make
this
one
proviso
if
we
all
would
stand
on
a
level
that
he
does
not
bring
into
the
account
the
external
advantages
of
his
position
he
should
rather
tell
us
a
tale
how
he
would
proceed
if
at
this
moment
he
were
thrown
entirely
upon
his
own
resources
as
we
are
gretchen
who
till
this
moment
had
kept
on
spinning
rose
and
seated
herself
as
usual
at
the
end
of
the
table
we
had
already
emptied
some
bottles
and
i
began
to
relate
the
hypothetical
history
of
my
life
in
the
best
humour
first
of
all
then
i
commend
myself
to
you
said
i
that
you
may
continue
the
custom
you
have
begun
to
bestow
on
me
if
you
gradually
procure
me
the
profit
of
all
the
occasional
poems
and
we
do
not
consume
them
in
mere
feasting
i
shall
soon
come
to
something
but
then
you
must
not
take
it
ill
if
i
dabble
also
in
your
handicraft
upon
this
i
told
them
what
i
had
observed
in
their
occupations
and
for
which
i
held
myself
fit
at
any
rate
each
one
had
previously
rated
his
in
money
and
i
asked
them
to
assist
me
also
in
completing
my
establishment
gretchen
had
listened
to
all
hitherto
very
attentively
and
that
in
a
position
which
well
suited
her
whether
she
chose
to
hear
or
to
speak
with
both
hands
she
clasped
her
folded
arms
and
rested
them
on
the
edge
of
the
table
thus
she
could
sit
a
long
while
without
moving
anything
but
her
head
which
was
never
done
without
occasion
or
meaning
she
had
several
times
put
in
a
word
and
helped
us
on
over
this
and
that
when
we
halted
in
our
projects
and
then
was
again
still
and
quiet
as
usual
i
kept
her
in
my
eye
and
it
may
readily
be
supposed
that
i
had
not
devised
and
uttered
my
plan
without
reference
to
her
my
passion
for
her
gave
to
what
i
said
such
an
air
of
truth
and
probability
that
for
a
moment
i
deceived
myself
imagined
myself
as
lonely
and
helpless
as
my
story
supposed
and
felt
extremely
happy
in
the
prospect
of
possessing
her
pylades
had
closed
his
confession
with
marriage
and
the
question
arose
among
the
rest
of
us
whether
our
plans
went
as
far
as
that
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
on
that
score
said
i
for
properly
a
wife
is
necessary
to
every
one
of
us
in
order
to
preserve
at
home
and
enable
us
to
enjoy
as
a
whole
what
we
rake
together
abroad
in
such
an
odd
way
i
then
made
a
sketch
of
a
wife
such
as
i
wished
and
it
must
have
turned
out
strangely
if
she
had
not
been
a
perfect
counterpart
of
gretchen
the
dirge
was
consumed
the
epithalamium
now
stood
beneficially
at
hand
i
overcame
all
fear
and
care
and
contrived
as
i
had
many
acquaintances
to
conceal
my
actual
evening
entertainments
from
my
family
to
see
and
to
be
near
the
dear
girl
was
soon
an
indispensable
condition
of
my
being
the
friends
had
grown
just
as
accustomed
to
me
and
we
were
almost
daily
together
as
if
it
could
not
be
otherwise
pylades
had
in
the
meantime
introduced
his
fair
one
into
the
house
and
this
pair
passed
many
an
evening
with
us
they
as
bride
and
bridegroom
though
still
very
much
in
the
bud
did
not
conceal
their
tenderness
gretchen
deportment
towards
me
was
only
suited
to
keep
me
at
a
distance
she
gave
her
hand
to
no
one
not
even
to
me
she
allowed
no
touch
yet
she
many
times
seated
herself
near
me
particularly
when
i
wrote
or
read
aloud
and
then
laying
her
arm
familiarly
upon
my
shoulder
she
looked
over
the
book
or
paper
if
however
i
ventured
on
a
similar
freedom
towards
her
she
withdrew
and
would
not
soon
return
this
position
she
often
repeated
and
indeed
all
her
attitudes
and
motions
were
very
uniform
but
always
equally
fitting
beautiful
and
charming
but
such
a
familiarity
i
never
saw
her
practise
towards
anybody
else
the
höchst
one
of
the
most
innocent
and
at
the
same
time
amusing
parties
of
pleasure
in
which
i
engaged
with
different
companies
of
young
people
was
this
that
we
seated
ourselves
in
the
höchst
observed
the
strange
passengers
packed
away
in
it
and
bantered
and
teased
now
this
one
now
that
as
pleasure
or
caprice
prompted
at
höchst
we
got
out
at
the
same
time
as
the
from
mentz
arrived
at
a
hotel
there
was
a
table
where
the
better
sort
of
travellers
coming
and
going
ate
with
each
other
and
then
proceeded
each
on
his
way
as
both
ships
returned
every
time
after
dining
we
sailed
up
to
frankfort
having
with
a
very
large
company
made
the
cheapest
that
was
possible
once
i
had
undertaken
this
journey
with
gretchen
cousins
when
a
young
man
joined
us
at
table
in
höchst
who
might
be
a
little
older
than
we
were
they
knew
him
and
he
got
himself
introduced
to
me
he
had
something
very
pleasing
in
his
manner
though
he
was
not
otherwise
distinguished
coming
from
mentz
he
now
went
back
with
us
to
frankfort
and
conversed
with
me
of
everything
that
related
to
the
internal
arrangements
of
the
city
and
the
public
offices
and
places
on
which
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
well
informed
when
we
separated
he
bade
me
farewell
and
added
that
he
wished
i
might
think
well
of
him
as
he
hoped
on
occasion
to
avail
himself
of
my
recommendation
i
did
not
know
what
he
meant
by
this
but
the
cousins
enlightened
me
some
days
after
they
spoke
well
of
him
and
asked
me
to
intercede
with
my
grandfather
as
a
moderate
appointment
was
just
now
vacant
which
this
friend
would
like
to
obtain
i
at
first
excused
myself
because
i
had
never
meddled
in
such
affairs
but
they
went
on
urging
me
until
i
resolved
to
do
it
i
had
already
many
times
remarked
that
in
these
grants
of
offices
which
unfortunately
were
often
regarded
as
matters
of
favour
the
mediation
of
my
grandmother
or
an
aunt
had
not
been
without
effect
i
was
now
so
advanced
as
to
arrogate
some
influence
to
myself
for
that
reason
to
gratify
my
friends
who
declared
themselves
under
every
sort
of
obligation
for
such
a
kindness
i
overcame
the
timidity
of
a
grandchild
and
undertook
to
deliver
a
written
application
that
was
handed
in
to
me
one
sunday
after
dinner
as
my
grandfather
was
busy
in
his
garden
all
the
more
because
autumn
was
approaching
and
i
tried
to
assist
him
on
every
side
i
came
forward
with
my
request
and
the
petition
after
some
hesitation
he
looked
at
it
and
asked
me
whether
i
knew
the
young
man
i
told
him
in
general
terms
what
was
to
be
said
and
he
let
the
matter
rest
there
if
he
has
merit
and
moreover
good
testimonials
i
will
favour
him
for
your
sake
and
his
own
he
said
no
more
and
for
a
long
while
i
heard
nothing
of
the
matter
gretchen
new
situation
for
some
time
i
had
observed
that
gretchen
span
no
more
but
on
the
other
hand
was
employed
in
sewing
and
that
too
on
very
fine
work
which
surprised
me
the
more
as
the
days
were
already
shortening
and
winter
was
coming
on
i
thought
no
farther
about
it
only
it
troubled
me
that
several
times
i
had
not
found
her
at
home
in
the
morning
as
formerly
and
could
not
learn
without
importunity
whither
she
had
gone
yet
i
was
destined
one
day
to
be
surprised
in
a
very
odd
manner
my
sister
who
was
getting
herself
ready
for
a
ball
asked
me
to
fetch
her
some
italian
flowers
at
a
fashionable
milliner
they
were
made
in
convents
and
were
small
and
pretty
myrtles
especially
and
the
like
came
out
quite
beautifully
and
naturally
i
granted
her
the
favour
and
went
to
the
shop
where
i
had
already
often
been
with
her
hardly
had
i
entered
and
greeted
the
proprietress
than
i
saw
sitting
in
the
window
a
lady
who
in
a
lace
cap
looked
very
young
and
pretty
and
in
a
silk
mantilla
seemed
very
well
shaped
i
could
easily
recognize
that
she
was
an
assistant
for
she
was
occupied
in
fastening
a
ribbon
and
feathers
upon
a
hat
the
milliner
showed
me
the
long
box
with
single
flowers
of
various
sorts
i
looked
them
over
and
as
i
made
my
choice
glanced
again
towards
the
lady
in
the
window
butious
if
not
unpleasant
consequences
for
some
time
already
count
lindto
gretchen
nay
was
forced
to
be
convinced
at
last
that
it
was
gretchen
herself
no
doubt
remained
when
she
winked
with
her
eyes
and
gave
me
a
sign
that
i
must
not
betray
our
acquaintance
i
now
with
my
choosing
and
rejecting
drove
the
milliner
into
despair
more
than
even
a
lady
could
have
done
i
had
in
fact
no
choice
for
i
was
excessively
confused
and
at
the
same
time
liked
to
linger
because
it
kept
me
near
the
girl
whose
disguise
annoyed
me
though
in
that
disguise
she
appeared
to
me
more
enchanting
than
ever
finally
the
milliner
seemed
to
lose
all
patience
and
with
her
own
hands
selected
for
me
a
whole
bandbox
full
of
flowers
which
i
was
to
place
before
my
sister
and
let
her
choose
for
herself
thus
i
was
as
it
were
driven
out
of
the
shop
while
she
sent
the
box
first
by
one
of
her
girls
scarcely
had
i
reached
home
than
my
father
caused
me
to
be
called
and
communicated
to
me
that
it
was
now
quite
certain
that
the
archduke
joseph
would
be
elected
and
crowned
king
of
rome
an
event
so
highly
important
was
not
to
be
expected
without
preparation
nor
allowed
to
pass
with
mere
gaping
and
staring
he
wished
therefore
he
said
to
go
through
with
me
the
election
and
of
the
two
last
coronations
as
well
as
through
the
last
capitulations
of
election
in
order
to
remark
what
new
conditions
might
be
added
in
the
present
instance
the
diaries
were
opened
and
we
occupied
ourselves
with
them
the
whole
day
till
far
into
the
night
while
the
pretty
girl
sometimes
in
her
old
sometimes
in
her
new
costume
ever
hovered
before
me
backwards
and
forwards
among
the
most
august
objects
of
the
holy
roman
empire
this
evening
it
was
impossible
to
see
her
and
i
lay
awake
through
a
very
restless
night
the
study
of
yesterday
was
the
next
day
zealously
resumed
and
it
was
not
till
towards
evening
that
i
found
it
possible
to
visit
my
fair
one
whom
i
met
again
in
her
usual
she
smiled
when
she
saw
me
but
i
did
not
venture
to
mention
anything
before
the
others
when
the
whole
company
sat
quietly
together
again
she
began
and
said
it
is
unfair
that
you
do
not
confide
to
our
friend
what
we
have
lately
resolved
upon
she
then
continued
to
relate
that
after
our
late
conversation
in
which
the
discussion
was
how
any
one
could
get
on
in
the
world
something
was
also
said
of
the
way
in
which
a
woman
could
enhance
the
value
of
her
talent
and
labour
and
advantageously
employ
her
time
the
cousins
had
consequently
proposed
that
she
should
make
an
experiment
at
a
milliner
who
was
just
then
in
want
of
an
assistant
they
had
she
said
arranged
with
the
woman
she
went
there
so
many
hours
and
was
well
paid
only
when
there
she
was
obliged
for
sake
to
conform
to
a
certain
dress
which
however
she
left
behind
her
every
time
as
it
did
not
at
all
suit
her
other
modes
of
life
and
employment
i
was
indeed
set
at
rest
by
this
declaration
but
it
did
not
quite
please
me
to
know
that
the
pretty
girl
was
in
a
public
shop
and
at
a
place
where
the
fashionable
world
found
a
convenient
resort
but
i
betrayed
nothing
and
strove
to
work
off
my
jealous
care
in
silence
for
this
the
younger
cousin
did
not
allow
me
a
long
time
as
he
once
more
came
forward
with
a
proposal
for
an
occasional
poem
told
me
all
the
personalities
and
at
once
desired
me
to
prepare
myself
for
the
invention
and
disposition
of
the
work
he
had
already
spoken
with
me
several
times
concerning
the
proper
treatment
of
such
a
theme
and
as
i
was
voluble
in
these
cases
he
readily
asked
me
to
explain
to
him
circumstantially
what
is
rhetorical
in
these
things
to
give
him
a
notion
of
the
matter
and
to
make
use
of
my
own
and
others
labours
in
this
kind
for
examples
the
young
man
had
some
brains
though
he
was
without
a
trace
of
a
poetical
vein
and
now
he
went
so
much
into
particulars
and
wished
to
have
such
an
account
of
everything
that
i
gave
utterance
to
the
remark
it
seems
as
if
you
wanted
to
encroach
upon
my
trade
and
steal
away
my
customers
i
will
not
deny
it
said
he
smiling
as
i
shall
do
you
no
harm
by
it
this
will
only
continue
to
the
time
when
you
go
to
the
university
and
till
then
you
must
allow
me
still
to
profit
something
by
your
society
most
cordially
i
replied
and
i
encouraged
him
to
draw
out
a
plan
to
choose
a
metre
according
to
the
character
of
his
subject
and
to
do
whatever
else
might
seem
necessary
he
went
to
work
in
earnest
but
did
not
succeed
i
was
in
the
end
compelled
to
so
much
of
it
that
i
could
more
easily
and
better
have
written
it
all
from
the
beginning
myself
yet
this
teaching
and
learning
this
mutual
labour
afforded
us
good
entertainment
gretchen
took
part
in
it
and
had
many
a
pretty
notion
so
that
we
were
all
pleased
we
may
indeed
say
happy
during
the
day
she
worked
at
the
milliner
in
the
evenings
we
generally
met
together
and
our
contentment
was
not
even
disturbed
when
at
last
the
commissions
for
occasional
poems
began
to
leave
off
still
we
felt
hurt
once
when
one
of
them
came
back
under
protest
because
it
did
not
suit
the
party
who
ordered
it
we
consoled
ourselves
however
as
we
considered
it
our
very
best
work
and
could
therefore
declare
the
other
a
bad
judge
the
cousin
who
was
determined
to
learn
something
at
any
rate
resorted
to
the
expedient
of
inventing
problems
in
the
solution
of
which
we
always
found
amusement
enough
but
as
they
brought
in
nothing
our
little
banquets
had
to
be
much
more
frugally
managed
preparations
for
the
election
that
great
political
object
the
election
and
coronation
of
a
king
of
rome
was
pursued
with
more
and
more
earnestness
the
assembling
of
the
electoral
college
originally
appointed
to
take
place
at
augsburg
in
the
october
of
was
now
transferred
to
frankfort
and
both
at
the
end
of
this
year
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
next
preparations
went
forward
which
should
usher
in
this
important
business
the
beginning
was
made
by
a
parade
never
yet
seen
by
us
one
of
our
chancery
officials
on
horseback
escorted
by
four
trumpeters
likewise
mounted
and
surrounded
by
a
guard
of
infantry
read
in
a
loud
clear
voice
at
all
the
corners
of
the
city
a
prolix
edict
which
announced
the
forthcoming
proceedings
and
exhorted
the
citizens
to
a
becoming
deportment
suitable
to
the
circumstances
the
council
was
occupied
with
weighty
considerations
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
imperial
despatched
by
the
hereditary
grand
marshal
made
his
appearance
in
order
to
arrange
and
designate
the
residences
of
the
ambassadors
and
their
suites
according
to
the
old
custom
our
house
lay
in
the
palatine
district
and
we
had
to
provide
for
a
new
but
agreeable
billetting
the
middle
story
which
count
thorane
had
formerly
occupied
was
given
up
to
a
cavalier
of
the
palatinate
and
as
baron
von
königsthal
the
nuremberg
occupied
the
upper
floor
we
were
still
more
crowded
than
in
the
time
of
the
french
this
served
me
as
a
new
excuse
to
be
out
of
doors
and
to
pass
the
greater
part
of
the
day
in
the
streets
that
i
might
see
all
that
was
open
to
public
view
after
the
preliminary
alteration
and
arrangement
of
the
rooms
in
the
had
seemed
to
us
worth
seeing
after
the
arrival
of
the
ambassadors
one
after
another
and
their
first
solemn
ascent
in
a
body
on
the
of
february
had
taken
place
we
admired
the
coming
in
of
the
imperial
commissioners
and
their
ascent
also
to
the
which
was
made
with
great
pomp
the
dignified
person
of
the
prince
of
lichtenstein
made
a
good
impression
yet
connoisseurs
maintained
that
the
showy
liveries
had
already
been
used
on
another
occasion
and
that
this
election
and
coronation
would
hardly
equal
in
brilliancy
that
of
charles
the
seventh
we
younger
folks
were
content
with
what
was
before
our
eyes
all
seemed
to
us
very
fine
and
much
of
it
perfectly
astonishing
the
electoral
congress
was
fixed
at
last
for
the
of
march
new
formalities
again
set
the
city
in
motion
and
the
alternate
visits
of
ceremony
on
the
part
of
the
ambassadors
kept
us
always
on
our
legs
we
were
compelled
too
to
watch
closely
as
we
were
not
only
to
gape
about
but
to
note
everything
well
in
order
to
give
a
proper
report
at
home
and
even
to
make
out
many
little
memoirs
on
which
my
father
and
herr
von
königsthal
had
deliberated
partly
for
our
exercise
and
partly
for
their
own
information
and
certainly
this
was
of
peculiar
advantage
to
me
as
i
was
enabled
very
tolerably
to
keep
a
living
election
and
as
far
as
regarded
externals
baron
von
plotho
the
person
who
first
of
all
made
a
durable
impression
upon
me
was
the
chief
ambassador
from
the
electorate
of
mentz
baron
von
erthal
afterwards
elector
without
having
anything
striking
in
his
figure
he
was
always
highly
pleasing
to
me
in
his
black
gown
trimmed
with
lace
the
second
ambassador
baron
von
groschlag
was
a
man
of
the
world
easy
in
his
exterior
but
conducting
himself
with
great
decorum
he
everywhere
produced
a
very
agreeable
impression
prince
esterhazy
the
bohemian
envoy
was
not
tall
though
lively
and
at
the
same
time
eminently
decorous
without
pride
or
coldness
i
had
a
special
liking
for
him
because
he
reminded
me
of
marshal
de
broglio
yet
the
form
and
dignity
of
these
excellent
persons
vanished
in
a
certain
degree
before
the
prejudice
that
was
entertained
in
favour
of
baron
von
plotho
the
brandenburg
ambassador
this
man
who
was
distinguished
by
a
certain
parsimony
both
in
his
own
clothes
and
in
his
liveries
and
equipages
had
been
greatly
renowned
from
the
time
of
the
seven
years
war
as
a
diplomatic
hero
at
ratisbon
when
the
notary
april
thought
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
to
serve
him
with
the
declaration
of
outlawry
which
had
been
issued
against
his
king
he
had
with
the
laconic
exclamation
what
you
serve
thrown
him
or
caused
him
to
be
thrown
down
stairs
we
believed
the
first
because
it
pleased
us
best
and
we
could
readily
believe
it
of
the
little
compact
man
with
his
black
fiery
eyes
glancing
here
and
there
all
eyes
were
directed
towards
him
particularly
when
he
alighted
there
arose
every
time
a
sort
of
joyous
whispering
and
but
little
was
wanting
to
a
regular
explosion
or
a
shout
of
so
high
did
the
king
and
all
who
were
devoted
to
him
body
and
soul
stand
in
favour
with
the
crowd
among
whom
besides
the
frankforters
were
germans
from
all
parts
on
the
one
hand
these
things
gave
me
much
pleasure
as
all
that
took
place
no
matter
of
what
nature
it
might
be
concealed
a
certain
meaning
indicated
some
internal
relation
and
such
symbolic
ceremonies
again
for
a
moment
represented
as
living
the
old
empire
of
germany
almost
choked
to
death
by
so
many
parchments
papers
and
books
but
on
the
other
hand
i
could
not
suppress
a
secret
displeasure
when
i
was
forced
at
home
on
my
father
account
to
transcribe
the
internal
transactions
and
at
the
same
time
to
remark
that
here
several
powers
which
balanced
each
other
stood
in
opposition
and
only
so
far
agreed
as
they
designed
to
limit
the
new
ruler
even
more
than
the
old
one
that
every
one
valued
his
influence
only
so
far
as
he
hoped
to
retain
or
enlarge
his
privileges
and
better
to
secure
his
independence
nay
on
this
occasion
they
were
more
attentive
than
usual
because
they
began
to
fear
joseph
the
second
his
vehemence
and
probable
plans
with
my
grandfather
and
other
members
of
the
council
whose
families
i
used
to
visit
this
was
no
pleasant
time
they
had
so
much
to
do
with
meeting
distinguished
guests
complimenting
and
the
delivery
of
presents
no
less
had
the
magistrate
both
in
general
and
in
particular
to
defend
himself
to
resist
and
to
protest
as
every
one
on
such
occasions
desires
to
extort
something
from
him
or
burden
him
with
something
und
few
of
those
to
whom
he
appeals
support
him
or
lend
him
their
aid
in
short
all
that
i
had
read
in
of
similar
incidents
on
similar
occasions
with
admiration
of
the
patience
and
perseverance
of
those
good
old
councilmen
came
once
more
vividly
before
my
eyes
many
vexations
arise
also
from
this
that
the
city
is
gradually
overrun
with
people
both
useful
and
needless
in
vain
are
the
courts
reminded
on
the
part
of
the
city
of
prescriptions
of
the
golden
bull
now
indeed
obsolete
not
only
the
deputies
with
their
attendants
but
many
persons
of
rank
and
others
who
come
from
curiosity
or
for
private
objects
stand
under
protection
and
the
question
as
to
who
is
to
be
billetted
out
and
who
is
to
hire
his
own
lodging
is
not
always
decided
at
once
the
tumult
constantly
increases
and
even
those
who
have
nothing
to
give
or
to
answer
for
begin
to
feel
uncomfortable
even
we
young
people
who
could
quietly
contemplate
it
all
ever
found
something
which
did
not
quite
satisfy
our
eyes
or
our
imagination
the
spanish
mantles
the
huge
feathered
hats
of
the
ambassadors
and
other
objects
here
and
there
had
indeed
a
truly
antique
look
but
there
was
a
great
deal
on
the
other
hand
so
or
entirely
modern
that
the
affair
assumed
throughout
a
motley
unsatisfactory
often
tasteless
appearance
we
were
very
happy
to
learn
therefore
that
great
preparations
were
made
on
account
of
the
journey
to
frankfort
of
the
emperor
and
future
king
that
the
proceedings
of
the
college
of
electors
which
were
based
on
the
last
electoral
capitulation
were
now
going
forward
rapidly
and
that
the
day
of
election
had
been
appointed
for
the
of
march
now
there
was
a
thought
of
fetching
the
insignia
of
the
empire
from
nuremberg
and
and
next
we
expected
the
entrance
of
the
elector
of
mentz
while
the
disputes
with
his
ambassadors
about
the
quartering
ever
continued
meanwhile
i
pursued
my
clerical
labours
at
home
very
actively
and
perceived
many
little
suggestions
which
came
in
from
all
sides
and
were
to
be
regarded
in
the
new
capitulation
every
rank
desired
to
see
its
privileges
guaranteed
and
its
importance
increased
in
this
document
very
many
such
observations
and
desires
were
however
put
aside
much
remained
as
it
was
though
the
suggestors
received
the
most
positive
assurances
that
the
neglect
should
in
no
wise
ensue
to
their
prejudice
in
the
meanwhile
the
office
of
imperial
marshal
was
forced
to
undertake
many
dangerous
affairs
the
crowd
of
strangers
increased
and
it
became
more
and
more
difficult
to
find
lodgings
for
them
nor
was
there
unanimity
as
to
the
limits
of
the
different
precincts
of
the
electors
the
magistracy
wished
to
keep
from
the
citizens
the
burdens
which
they
were
not
bound
to
bear
and
thus
day
and
night
there
were
hourly
grievances
redresses
contests
and
misunderstandings
the
entrance
of
the
elector
of
mentz
happened
on
the
of
may
then
began
the
cannonading
with
which
for
a
long
time
we
were
often
to
be
deafened
this
solemnity
was
important
in
the
series
of
ceremonies
for
all
the
men
whom
we
had
hitherto
seen
high
as
they
were
in
rank
were
still
only
subordinates
but
here
appeared
a
sovereign
an
independent
prince
the
first
after
the
emperor
preceded
and
accompanied
by
a
large
retinue
worthy
of
himself
of
the
pomp
which
marked
his
entrance
i
should
have
much
to
tell
if
i
did
not
purpose
returning
to
it
hereafter
and
on
an
occasion
which
no
one
could
easily
guess
lavater
what
i
refer
to
is
this
the
same
day
lavater
on
his
return
home
from
berlin
came
through
frankfort
and
saw
the
solemnity
now
though
such
worldly
formalities
could
not
have
the
least
value
for
him
this
procession
with
its
display
and
all
its
accessaries
might
have
been
distinctly
impressed
on
his
very
lively
imagination
for
many
years
afterwards
when
this
eminent
but
singular
man
showed
me
a
poetical
paraphrase
of
i
believe
the
revelation
of
john
i
discovered
the
entrance
of
copied
step
by
step
figure
by
figure
circumstance
by
circumstance
from
the
entrance
of
the
elector
of
mentz
into
frankfort
in
such
a
manner
too
that
even
the
tassels
on
the
heads
of
the
horses
were
not
wanting
more
can
be
said
on
this
point
when
i
reach
the
epoch
of
that
strange
kind
of
poetry
by
which
it
was
supposed
that
the
myths
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
were
brought
nearer
to
our
view
and
feelings
when
they
were
completely
travestied
into
the
modern
style
and
clothed
with
the
vestments
of
present
life
whether
gentle
or
simple
how
this
mode
of
treatment
gradually
obtained
favour
will
be
likewise
discussed
hereafter
yet
i
may
here
simply
remark
that
it
could
not
well
be
carried
further
than
it
was
by
lavater
and
his
emulators
one
of
these
having
described
the
three
holy
kings
riding
into
bethlehem
in
such
modern
form
that
the
princes
and
gentlemen
whom
lavater
used
to
visit
were
not
to
be
mistaken
as
the
persons
we
will
then
for
the
present
allow
the
elector
emeric
joseph
to
enter
the
compostello
incognito
so
to
speak
and
turn
to
gretchen
whom
just
as
the
crowd
was
dispersing
i
spied
in
the
crowd
accompanied
by
pylades
and
his
mistress
the
three
now
seeming
to
be
inseparable
we
had
scarcely
come
up
to
each
other
and
exchanged
greetings
than
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
pass
the
evening
together
and
i
kept
the
appointment
punctually
the
usual
company
had
assembled
and
each
one
had
something
to
relate
to
say
or
to
remark
how
one
had
been
most
struck
by
this
thing
and
another
by
that
your
speeches
said
gretchen
at
last
perplex
me
even
more
than
the
events
of
the
time
themselves
what
i
have
seen
i
can
not
make
out
and
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
a
great
deal
of
it
means
i
replied
that
it
was
easy
for
me
to
render
her
this
service
she
had
only
to
say
what
particularly
interested
her
this
she
did
and
as
i
was
about
to
explain
some
points
it
was
found
that
it
would
be
better
to
proceed
in
order
i
not
unskilfully
compared
these
solemnities
and
functions
to
a
play
in
which
the
curtain
was
let
down
at
will
while
the
actors
played
on
and
was
then
raised
again
so
that
the
spectators
could
once
more
to
some
extent
take
part
in
the
action
as
now
i
was
very
loquacious
when
i
was
allowed
my
own
way
i
related
the
whole
from
the
beginning
down
to
the
time
present
in
the
best
order
and
to
make
the
subject
of
my
discourse
more
apparent
did
not
fail
to
use
the
pencil
and
the
large
slate
being
only
slightly
interrupted
by
some
questions
and
obstinate
assertions
of
the
others
i
brought
my
discourse
to
a
close
to
the
general
satisfaction
while
gretchen
by
her
unbroken
attention
had
highly
encouraged
me
at
last
she
thanked
me
and
envied
as
she
said
all
who
were
informed
of
the
affairs
of
this
world
and
knew
how
this
and
that
came
about
and
what
it
signified
she
wished
she
were
a
boy
and
managed
to
acknowledge
with
much
kindness
that
she
was
indebted
to
me
for
a
great
deal
of
instruction
if
i
were
a
boy
said
she
we
would
learn
something
good
together
at
the
university
the
conversation
continued
in
this
strain
she
definitively
resolved
to
take
instruction
in
french
of
the
absolute
necessity
of
which
she
had
become
well
aware
in
the
shop
i
asked
her
why
she
no
longer
went
there
for
dining
the
latter
times
not
being
able
to
go
out
much
in
the
evening
i
had
often
passed
the
shop
during
the
day
for
her
sake
merely
to
see
her
for
a
moment
she
explained
that
she
had
not
liked
to
expose
herself
there
in
these
unsettled
times
as
soon
as
the
city
returned
to
its
former
condition
she
intended
to
go
there
again
approach
of
the
election
then
the
discourse
was
on
the
impending
day
of
election
i
contrived
to
tell
at
length
what
was
going
to
happen
and
how
and
to
support
my
demonstrations
in
detail
by
drawings
on
the
tablet
for
i
had
the
place
of
conclave
with
its
altars
thrones
seats
and
chairs
perfectly
before
my
mind
we
separated
at
the
proper
time
and
in
a
peculiarly
comfortable
frame
of
mind
for
with
a
young
couple
who
are
in
any
degree
harmoniously
formed
by
nature
nothing
can
conduce
to
a
more
beautiful
union
than
when
the
maiden
is
anxious
to
learn
and
the
youth
inclined
to
teach
there
arises
from
it
a
and
agreeable
relation
she
sees
in
him
the
creator
of
her
spiritual
existence
and
he
sees
in
her
a
creature
that
ascribes
her
perfection
not
to
nature
not
to
chance
nor
to
any
inclination
but
to
a
mutual
will
and
this
reciprocation
is
so
sweet
that
we
can
not
wonder
if
from
the
days
of
the
old
and
the
new
abelard
the
most
violent
passions
and
as
much
happiness
as
unhappiness
have
arisen
from
such
an
intercourse
of
two
beings
with
the
next
day
began
great
commotion
in
the
city
on
account
of
the
visits
paid
and
returned
which
now
took
place
with
the
greatest
ceremony
but
what
particularly
interested
me
as
a
citizen
of
frankfort
and
gave
rise
to
a
great
many
reflections
was
the
taking
of
the
oath
of
security
by
the
council
the
military
and
the
body
of
citizens
not
through
representatives
but
personally
and
in
mass
first
in
the
great
hall
of
the
römer
by
the
magistracy
and
then
in
the
great
square
the
römerberg
by
all
the
citizens
according
to
their
respective
ranks
gradations
or
quarterings
and
lastly
by
the
rest
of
the
military
here
one
could
survey
at
a
single
glance
the
entire
commonwealth
assembled
for
the
honourable
purpose
of
swearing
security
to
the
head
and
members
of
the
empire
and
unbroken
peace
during
the
great
work
now
impending
the
electors
of
treves
and
of
cologne
had
now
also
arrived
in
person
on
the
evening
before
the
day
of
election
all
strangers
are
sent
out
of
the
city
the
gates
are
closed
the
jews
are
confined
to
their
quarter
and
the
citizen
of
frankfort
prides
himself
not
a
little
that
he
alone
may
be
a
witness
of
so
great
a
solemnity
all
that
had
hitherto
taken
place
was
tolerably
modern
the
highest
and
high
personages
moved
about
only
in
coaches
but
now
we
were
going
to
see
them
in
the
primitive
manner
on
horseback
the
concourse
and
rush
were
extraordinary
i
managed
to
squeeze
myself
into
the
römer
which
i
knew
as
familiarly
as
a
mouse
does
the
private
till
i
reached
the
main
entrance
before
which
the
electors
and
ambassadors
who
had
first
arrived
in
their
and
had
assembled
above
were
now
to
mount
their
horses
the
stately
steeds
were
richly
laced
housings
and
ornamented
in
every
way
the
elector
emeric
joseph
a
man
looked
well
on
horseback
of
the
other
two
i
remember
less
excepting
that
the
red
princes
mantles
trimmed
with
ermine
which
we
had
been
accustomed
to
see
only
in
pictures
before
seemed
to
us
very
romantic
in
the
open
air
the
ambassadors
of
the
absent
temporal
electors
with
their
spanish
dresses
of
gold
brocade
embroidered
over
with
gold
and
trimmed
with
gold
lace
likewise
did
our
eyes
good
and
the
large
feathers
particularly
that
waved
most
splendidly
from
the
hats
which
were
cocked
in
the
antique
style
but
what
did
not
please
me
were
the
short
modern
breeches
the
white
silk
stockings
and
the
fashionable
shoes
we
should
have
liked
gilded
as
much
as
they
pleased
sandals
or
something
of
the
kind
that
we
might
have
seen
a
more
consistent
costume
in
deportment
the
ambassador
von
plotho
again
distinguished
himself
from
all
the
rest
he
appeared
lively
and
cheerful
and
seemed
to
have
no
great
respect
for
the
whole
ceremony
for
when
his
an
elderly
gentleman
could
not
leap
immediately
on
his
horse
and
he
was
therefore
forced
to
wait
some
time
in
the
grand
entrance
he
did
not
refrain
from
laughing
till
his
own
horse
was
brought
forward
upon
which
he
swung
himself
very
dexterously
and
was
again
admired
by
us
as
a
most
worthy
representative
of
frederick
the
second
now
the
curtain
was
for
us
once
more
let
down
i
had
indeed
tried
to
force
my
way
into
the
church
but
that
place
was
more
inconvenient
than
agreeable
the
voters
had
withdrawn
into
the
where
prolix
ceremonies
usurped
the
place
of
a
deliberate
consideration
as
to
the
election
after
long
delay
pressure
and
bustle
the
people
at
last
heard
the
name
of
joseph
the
second
who
was
proclaimed
king
of
rome
approach
of
the
emperor
and
king
the
thronging
of
strangers
into
the
city
became
greater
and
greater
everybody
went
about
in
his
holiday
clothes
so
that
at
last
none
but
dresses
entirely
of
gold
were
found
worthy
of
note
the
emperor
and
king
had
already
arrived
at
a
castle
of
the
counts
of
schönborn
and
were
there
in
the
customary
manner
greeted
and
welcomed
but
the
city
celebrated
this
important
epoch
by
spiritual
festivals
of
all
the
religions
by
high
masses
and
sermons
and
on
the
temporal
side
by
incessant
firing
of
cannon
as
an
accompaniment
to
the
if
all
these
public
solemnities
from
the
beginning
up
to
this
point
had
been
regarded
as
a
deliberate
work
of
art
not
much
to
find
fault
with
would
have
been
found
all
was
well
prepared
the
public
scenes
opened
gradually
and
went
on
increasing
in
importance
the
men
grew
in
number
the
personages
in
dignity
their
appurtenances
as
well
as
themselves
in
splendour
and
thus
it
advanced
with
every
day
till
at
last
even
a
and
firm
eye
became
bewildered
the
entrance
of
the
elector
of
mentz
which
we
have
refused
to
describe
more
completely
was
magnificent
and
imposing
enough
to
suggest
to
the
imagination
of
an
eminent
man
the
advent
of
a
great
prophesied
even
we
were
not
a
little
dazzled
by
it
but
now
our
expectation
was
stretched
to
the
utmost
as
it
was
said
that
the
emperor
and
the
future
king
were
approaching
the
city
at
a
little
distance
from
sachsenhausen
a
tent
had
been
erected
in
which
the
entire
magistracy
remained
to
show
the
appropriate
honour
and
to
proffer
the
keys
of
the
city
to
the
chief
of
the
empire
further
out
on
a
fair
spacious
plain
stood
another
a
state
pavilion
whither
the
whole
body
of
electoral
princes
and
ambassadors
repaired
while
their
retinues
extended
along
the
whole
way
that
gradually
as
their
turns
came
they
might
again
move
towards
the
city
and
enter
properly
into
the
procession
by
this
time
the
emperor
reached
the
tent
entered
it
and
the
princes
and
ambassadors
after
a
most
respectful
reception
withdrew
to
facilitate
the
passage
of
the
chief
ruler
the
imperial
carriage
we
others
who
remained
in
the
city
to
admire
this
pomp
within
the
walls
and
streets
still
more
than
could
have
been
done
in
the
open
fields
were
very
well
entertained
for
a
while
by
the
barricade
set
up
by
the
citizens
in
the
lanes
by
the
throng
of
people
and
by
the
various
jests
and
improprieties
which
arose
till
the
ringing
of
bells
and
the
thunder
of
cannon
announced
to
us
the
immediate
approach
of
majesty
what
must
have
been
particularly
grateful
to
a
frankforter
was
that
on
this
occasion
in
the
presence
of
so
many
sovereigns
and
their
representatives
the
imperial
city
of
frankfort
also
appeared
as
a
little
sovereign
for
her
equerry
opened
the
procession
chargers
with
armorial
trappings
upon
which
the
white
eagle
on
a
red
field
looked
very
fine
followed
him
then
came
attendants
and
officials
drummers
and
trumpeters
and
deputies
of
the
council
accompanied
by
the
clerks
of
the
council
in
the
city
livery
on
foot
immediately
behind
these
were
the
three
companies
cf
citizen
cavalry
very
well
mounted
the
same
that
we
had
seen
from
our
youth
at
the
reception
of
the
escort
and
on
other
public
occasions
we
rejoiced
in
our
participation
of
the
honour
and
in
our
part
of
a
sovereignty
which
now
appeared
in
its
full
brilliancy
the
different
trains
of
the
hereditary
imperial
marshal
and
of
the
envoys
deputed
by
the
six
temporal
electors
marched
after
these
step
by
step
none
of
them
consisted
of
less
than
twenty
attendants
and
two
some
even
of
a
greater
number
the
retinue
of
the
spiritual
electors
was
ever
on
the
increase
their
servants
and
domestic
officers
seemed
innumerable
the
elector
of
cologne
and
the
elector
of
treves
had
above
twenty
and
the
elector
of
mentz
quite
as
many
alone
the
servants
both
on
horseback
and
on
foot
were
clothed
most
splendidly
throughout
the
lords
in
the
equipages
spiritual
and
temporal
had
not
omitted
to
appear
richly
and
venerably
dressed
and
adorned
with
all
the
badges
of
their
orders
the
train
of
his
imperial
majesty
now
as
was
fit
surpassed
all
the
rest
the
the
led
horses
the
equipages
the
shabracks
and
caparisons
attracted
every
eye
and
the
sixteen
of
the
imperial
chamberlains
privy
councillors
high
chamberlain
high
stewards
and
high
equerry
closed
with
great
pomp
this
division
of
the
procession
which
in
spite
of
its
magnificence
and
extent
was
still
only
to
be
the
but
now
the
line
concentrated
itself
more
and
more
while
the
dignity
and
parade
kept
on
increasing
for
in
the
midst
of
a
chosen
escort
of
their
own
domestic
attendants
the
most
of
them
on
foot
and
a
few
on
horseback
appeared
the
electoral
ambassadors
as
well
as
the
electors
in
person
in
ascending
order
each
one
in
a
magnificent
immediately
behind
the
elector
of
mentz
ten
imperial
footmen
one
and
forty
lackeys
and
eight
heyducks
announced
their
majesties
the
most
magnificent
furnished
even
at
the
back
part
with
an
entire
window
of
ornamented
with
paintings
lacker
carved
work
and
gilding
covered
with
red
embroidered
velvet
on
the
top
and
inside
allowed
us
very
conveniently
to
behold
the
emperor
and
king
the
heads
in
all
their
glory
the
procession
was
led
a
long
circuitous
route
partly
from
necessity
that
it
might
be
able
to
unfold
itself
and
partly
to
render
it
visible
to
the
great
multitude
of
people
it
had
passed
through
sachsenhausen
over
the
bridge
up
the
fahrgasse
then
down
the
zeile
and
turned
towards
the
inner
city
through
the
katharinenpforte
formerly
a
gate
and
since
the
enlargement
of
the
city
an
open
thoroughfare
here
it
had
been
fortunately
considered
that
for
a
series
of
years
the
external
grandeur
of
the
world
had
gone
on
expanding
both
in
height
and
breadth
measure
had
been
taken
and
it
was
found
that
the
present
imperial
could
not
without
striking
its
carved
work
and
other
outward
decorations
get
through
this
gateway
through
which
so
many
princes
and
emperors
had
gone
backwards
and
forwards
the
matter
was
debated
and
to
avoid
an
inconvenient
circuit
it
was
resolved
to
take
up
the
pavements
and
to
contrive
a
gentle
descent
and
ascent
with
the
same
new
they
had
also
removed
all
the
projecting
eaves
from
the
shops
and
booths
in
the
street
that
neither
crown
nor
eagle
nor
the
genii
should
receive
any
shock
or
injury
eagerly
as
directed
our
eyes
to
the
high
personages
when
this
precious
vessel
with
such
precious
contents
approached
us
we
could
not
avoid
turning
our
looks
upon
the
noble
horses
their
harness
and
its
embroidery
but
the
strange
coachmen
and
outriders
both
sitting
on
the
horses
particularly
struck
us
they
looked
as
if
they
had
come
from
some
other
nation
or
even
worn
another
world
with
their
long
black
and
yellow
velvet
coats
and
their
caps
with
large
plumes
of
feathers
after
the
imperial
court
fashion
now
the
crowd
became
so
dense
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
much
more
the
swiss
guard
on
both
sides
of
the
carriage
the
hereditary
marshal
holding
the
saxon
sword
upwards
in
his
right
hand
the
as
leaders
of
the
imperial
guard
riding
behind
the
carriage
the
imperial
pages
in
a
body
and
finally
the
imperial
itself
in
black
velvet
frocks
with
all
the
seams
edged
with
gold
under
which
were
red
coats
and
camisoles
likewise
richly
decked
with
gold
one
scarcely
recovered
oneself
from
sheer
seeing
pointing
and
showing
so
that
the
scarcely
less
splendidly
clad
of
the
electors
were
barely
looked
at
and
we
should
perhaps
have
withdrawn
from
the
windows
if
we
had
not
wished
to
take
a
view
of
our
own
magistracy
who
closed
the
procession
in
their
fifteen
coaches
and
particularly
the
clerk
of
the
council
with
the
city
keys
on
red
velvet
cushions
that
our
company
of
city
grenadiers
should
cover
the
rear
seemed
to
us
honourable
enough
and
we
felt
doubly
and
highly
edified
as
germans
and
as
frankfurters
by
this
great
day
maria
theresa
we
had
taken
our
place
in
a
house
which
the
procession
had
to
pass
again
when
it
returned
from
the
cathedral
of
religious
services
of
music
of
rites
and
solemnities
of
addresses
and
answers
of
propositions
and
readings
aloud
there
was
so
much
in
church
choir
and
conclave
before
it
came
to
the
swearing
of
the
electoral
capitulation
that
we
had
time
enough
to
partake
of
an
excellent
collation
and
to
empty
many
bottles
to
the
health
of
our
old
and
young
ruler
the
conversation
in
the
meanwhile
as
is
usual
on
such
occasions
reverted
to
the
time
past
and
there
were
not
wanting
aged
persons
who
preferred
that
to
the
present
at
least
with
respect
to
a
certain
human
interest
and
impassioned
sympathy
which
then
prevailed
at
the
coronation
of
francis
the
first
all
had
not
been
so
settled
as
now
peace
had
not
yet
been
concluded
france
and
the
electors
of
brandenburg
and
the
palatinate
were
opposed
to
the
election
the
troops
of
the
future
emperor
were
stationed
at
heidelberg
where
he
had
his
and
the
insignia
of
the
empire
coming
from
aix
were
almost
carried
off
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
palatinate
meanwhile
negotiations
went
on
and
on
neither
side
was
the
affair
conducted
in
the
strictest
manner
maria
theresa
though
then
pregnant
comes
in
person
to
see
the
coronation
of
her
husband
which
is
at
last
carried
into
effect
she
arrived
at
aschaffenburg
and
went
on
board
a
yacht
in
order
to
repair
to
frankfort
francis
from
heidelberg
thinks
to
meet
his
wife
but
comes
too
late
she
has
already
departed
unknown
he
throws
himself
into
a
little
boat
hastens
after
her
reaches
her
ship
and
the
loving
pair
is
delighted
at
this
surprising
meeting
the
story
spreads
immediately
and
all
the
world
sympathizes
with
this
tender
pair
so
richly
blessed
with
their
children
who
have
been
so
inseparable
since
their
union
that
once
on
a
journey
from
vienna
to
florence
they
are
forced
to
keep
quarantine
together
on
the
venetian
border
maria
theresa
is
welcomed
in
the
city
with
rejoicings
she
enters
the
inn
while
the
great
tent
for
the
reception
of
her
husband
is
erected
on
the
bornheim
heath
there
of
the
spiritual
electors
is
found
only
mentz
and
of
the
ambassadors
of
the
temporal
electors
only
saxony
bohemia
and
hanover
the
entrance
begins
and
what
it
may
lack
of
completeness
and
splendour
is
richly
compensated
by
the
presence
of
a
beautiful
lady
she
stands
upon
the
balcony
of
the
house
and
greets
her
husband
with
cries
of
and
clapping
of
hands
the
people
joined
excited
to
the
highest
enthusiasm
as
the
great
are
after
all
men
the
citizen
thinks
them
his
equals
when
he
wishes
to
love
them
and
that
he
can
best
do
when
he
can
picture
them
to
himself
as
loving
husbands
tender
parents
devoted
brothers
and
true
friends
at
that
time
all
happiness
had
been
wished
and
prophesied
and
it
was
seen
fulfilled
in
the
son
to
whom
everybody
was
well
inclined
on
account
of
his
handsome
youthful
form
and
upon
whom
the
world
set
the
greatest
hopes
on
account
of
the
great
qualities
that
he
showed
we
had
become
quite
absorbed
in
the
past
and
future
when
some
friends
who
came
in
recalled
us
to
the
present
they
were
of
those
who
know
the
value
of
novelty
and
therefore
hasten
to
announce
it
first
they
were
even
able
to
tell
of
a
fine
humane
trait
in
those
exalted
personages
whom
we
had
seen
go
by
with
the
greatest
pomp
it
had
been
concerted
that
on
the
way
between
heusenstamm
and
the
great
tent
the
emperor
and
king
should
find
the
landgrave
of
darmstadt
in
the
forest
this
old
prince
now
approaching
the
grave
wished
to
see
once
more
the
master
to
whom
he
had
been
devoted
in
former
times
both
might
remember
the
day
when
the
landgrave
brought
over
to
heidelberg
the
decree
of
the
electors
choosing
francis
as
emperor
and
replied
to
the
valuable
presents
he
received
with
protestations
of
unalterable
devotion
these
eminent
persons
stood
in
a
grove
of
firs
and
the
landgrave
weak
with
old
age
supported
himself
against
a
pine
to
continue
the
conversation
which
was
not
without
emotion
on
both
sides
the
place
was
afterwards
marked
in
an
innocent
way
and
we
young
people
sometimes
wandered
to
it
thus
several
hours
had
passed
in
remembrance
of
the
old
and
consideration
of
the
new
when
the
procession
though
curtailed
and
more
compact
again
passed
before
our
eyes
and
we
were
enabled
to
observe
and
mark
the
detail
more
closely
and
imprint
it
on
our
minds
for
the
future
from
that
moment
the
city
was
in
uninterrupted
motion
for
until
each
and
every
one
whom
it
behoved
and
of
whom
it
was
required
had
paid
their
respects
to
the
highest
dignities
and
exhibited
themselves
one
by
one
there
was
no
end
to
the
marching
to
and
fro
and
the
court
of
each
one
of
the
high
persons
present
could
be
very
conveniently
repeated
in
detail
now
too
the
insignia
of
the
empire
arrived
but
that
no
ancient
usage
might
be
omitted
even
in
this
respect
they
had
to
remain
half
a
day
till
late
at
night
in
the
open
field
on
recount
of
a
dispute
about
territory
and
escort
between
the
elector
of
mentz
and
the
city
the
latter
yielded
the
people
of
mentz
escorted
the
insignia
as
far
as
the
barricade
and
so
the
affair
terminated
for
this
time
at
evening
with
gretchen
in
these
days
i
did
not
come
to
myself
at
home
i
had
to
write
and
copy
everything
had
to
be
seen
and
so
ended
the
month
of
march
the
second
half
of
which
had
been
so
rich
in
festivals
for
us
i
had
promised
gretchen
a
faithful
and
complete
account
of
what
had
lately
happened
and
of
what
was
to
be
expected
on
the
this
great
day
approached
i
thought
more
how
i
should
tell
it
to
her
than
of
what
properly
was
to
be
told
all
that
came
under
my
eyes
and
my
pen
i
merely
worked
up
rapidly
for
this
sole
and
immediate
use
at
last
i
reached
her
residence
somewhat
late
one
evening
and
was
not
a
little
proud
to
think
how
my
discourse
on
this
occasion
would
be
much
more
successful
than
the
first
unprepared
one
but
a
momentary
incitement
often
brings
us
and
others
through
us
more
joy
than
the
most
deliberate
purpose
can
afford
i
found
indeed
pretty
nearly
the
same
company
but
there
were
some
unknown
persons
among
them
they
sat
down
to
play
all
except
gretchen
and
her
younger
cousin
who
remained
with
me
at
the
slate
the
dear
girl
expressed
most
gracefully
her
delight
that
she
though
a
stranger
had
passed
for
a
citizen
on
the
and
had
taken
part
in
that
unique
spectacle
she
thanked
me
most
warmly
for
having
managed
to
take
care
of
her
and
for
having
been
so
attentive
as
to
procure
her
through
pylades
all
sorts
of
admissions
by
means
of
billets
directions
friends
and
intercessions
she
liked
to
hear
about
the
jewels
of
the
empire
i
promised
her
that
we
should
if
possible
see
these
together
she
made
some
jesting
remarks
when
she
learned
that
the
garments
and
crown
had
been
tried
on
the
young
king
i
knew
where
she
would
gaze
at
the
solemnities
of
the
and
directed
her
attention
to
everything
that
was
impending
and
particularly
to
what
might
be
minutely
inspected
from
her
place
of
view
thus
we
forgot
to
think
about
time
it
was
already
past
midnight
and
i
found
that
i
unfortunately
had
not
the
with
me
i
could
not
enter
the
house
without
making
the
greatest
disturbance
i
communicated
my
embarrassment
to
her
after
all
said
she
it
will
be
best
for
the
company
to
remain
together
the
cousins
and
the
strangers
had
already
had
this
in
mind
because
it
was
not
known
where
they
would
be
lodged
for
the
night
the
matter
was
soon
decided
gretchen
went
to
make
some
coffee
after
bringing
in
and
lighting
a
large
brass
lamp
furnished
with
oil
and
wick
because
the
candles
threatened
to
burn
out
the
coffee
served
to
enliven
us
for
several
hours
but
the
game
gradually
slackened
conversation
failed
the
mother
slept
in
the
great
chair
the
strangers
weary
from
travelling
nodded
here
and
there
and
pylades
and
his
fair
one
sat
in
a
corner
she
had
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
had
gone
to
sleep
and
he
did
not
keep
long
awake
the
younger
cousin
sitting
opposite
to
us
by
the
slate
had
crossed
his
arms
before
him
and
slept
with
his
face
resting
upon
them
i
sat
in
the
behind
the
table
and
gretchen
by
me
we
talked
in
a
low
voice
but
at
last
sleep
overcame
her
also
she
leaned
her
head
on
my
shoulder
and
sank
at
once
into
a
slumber
thus
i
now
sat
the
only
one
awake
in
a
most
singular
position
in
which
the
kind
brother
of
death
soon
put
me
also
to
rest
i
went
to
sleep
and
when
i
awoke
it
was
already
bright
day
gretchen
was
standing
before
the
mirror
arranging
her
little
cap
she
was
more
lovely
than
ever
and
when
i
departed
cordially
pressed
my
hands
i
crept
home
by
a
roundabout
way
for
on
the
side
towards
the
little
my
father
had
opened
a
sort
of
little
in
the
wall
not
without
the
opposition
of
his
neighbour
this
side
we
avoided
when
we
wanted
not
to
be
observed
by
him
in
coming
home
my
mother
whose
mediation
always
came
in
well
for
us
had
endeavoured
to
palliate
my
absence
in
the
morning
at
breakfast
by
the
supposition
that
i
had
gone
out
early
and
i
experienced
no
disagreeable
effects
from
this
innocent
night
taken
as
a
whole
this
infinitely
various
world
which
surrounded
me
produced
upon
me
but
a
very
simple
impression
i
had
no
interest
but
to
mark
closely
the
outside
of
the
objects
no
business
but
that
with
which
i
had
been
charged
by
my
father
and
herr
von
königsthal
by
which
indeed
i
perceived
the
inner
course
of
things
i
had
no
liking
but
for
gretchen
and
no
other
view
than
to
see
and
apprehend
all
properly
that
i
might
be
able
to
repeat
it
with
her
and
explain
it
to
her
often
when
a
train
was
going
by
i
described
it
half
aloud
to
myself
to
assure
myself
of
all
the
particulars
and
to
be
praised
by
my
fair
one
for
this
attention
and
accuracy
the
applause
and
acknowledgments
of
the
others
i
regarded
as
a
mere
appendix
i
was
indeed
presented
to
many
exalted
and
distinguished
persons
but
partly
no
one
had
time
to
trouble
himself
about
others
and
partly
older
people
do
not
know
at
once
how
they
should
converse
with
a
young
man
and
try
him
i
on
my
side
was
likewise
not
particularly
skilful
in
adapting
myself
to
people
generally
i
acquired
their
favour
but
not
their
approbation
whatever
occupied
me
was
completely
present
to
me
but
i
did
not
ask
whether
it
might
be
also
suitable
t
others
i
was
mostly
too
lively
or
too
quiet
and
appeared
either
importunate
or
sullen
just
as
persons
attracted
or
repelled
me
and
thus
i
was
considered
to
be
indeed
full
of
promise
but
at
the
same
time
was
declared
eccentric
the
the
dawned
at
last
on
the
of
april
the
weather
was
favourable
and
everybody
was
in
motion
i
with
several
of
my
relations
and
friends
had
been
provided
with
a
good
place
in
one
of
the
upper
stories
of
the
römer
itself
where
we
might
completely
survey
the
whole
we
betook
ourselves
to
the
spot
very
early
in
the
morning
and
from
above
as
in
a
view
contemplated
the
arrangements
which
we
had
inspected
more
closely
the
day
before
there
was
the
fountain
with
two
large
tubs
on
the
left
and
right
into
which
the
on
the
post
was
to
pour
from
its
two
beaks
white
wine
on
this
side
and
red
wine
on
that
there
gathered
into
a
heap
lay
the
oats
here
stood
the
large
wooden
hut
in
which
we
had
several
days
since
seen
the
whole
fat
ox
roasted
and
basted
on
a
huge
spit
before
a
charcoal
fire
all
the
avenues
leading
out
from
the
römer
and
from
other
streets
back
to
the
römer
were
secured
on
both
sides
by
barriers
and
guards
the
great
square
was
gradually
filled
and
the
waving
and
pressure
grew
every
moment
stronger
and
more
in
motion
as
the
multitude
always
if
possible
endeavoured
to
reach
the
spot
where
some
new
scene
arose
and
something
particular
was
announced
all
this
time
there
reigned
a
tolerable
stillness
and
when
the
were
sounded
all
the
people
seemed
struck
with
terror
and
amazement
what
first
attracted
the
attention
of
all
who
could
overlook
the
square
from
above
was
the
train
in
which
the
lords
of
aix
and
nuremberg
brought
the
to
the
cathedral
these
as
palladia
had
been
assigned
the
first
place
in
the
carnage
and
the
deputies
sat
before
them
on
the
back
seat
with
becoming
reverence
now
the
three
electors
betake
themselves
to
the
cathedral
after
the
presentation
of
the
insignia
to
the
elector
of
mentz
the
crown
and
sword
are
immediately
carried
to
the
imperial
quarters
the
further
arrangements
and
manifold
ceremonies
occupied
in
the
interim
the
chief
persons
as
well
as
the
spectators
in
the
church
as
we
other
persons
could
well
imagine
in
the
meanwhile
before
our
eyes
the
ambassadors
ascended
to
the
römer
from
which
the
canopy
is
carried
by
the
into
the
imperial
quarters
the
hereditary
marshal
count
von
pappenheim
instantly
mounts
his
horse
he
was
a
very
handsome
slender
gentleman
whom
the
spanish
costume
the
rich
doublet
the
gold
mantle
the
high
feathered
hat
and
the
loose
flying
hair
became
very
well
he
puts
himself
in
motion
and
amid
the
sound
of
all
the
bells
the
ambassadors
follow
him
on
horseback
to
the
quarters
of
the
emperor
in
still
greater
magnificence
than
on
the
day
of
election
one
would
have
liked
to
be
there
too
as
indeed
on
this
day
it
would
have
been
altogether
desirable
to
multiply
however
we
told
each
other
what
was
going
on
there
now
the
emperor
is
putting
on
his
domestic
robes
we
said
a
new
dress
made
after
the
old
carolingian
pattern
the
hereditary
officers
receive
the
insignia
and
with
them
get
on
horseback
the
emperor
in
his
robes
the
roman
king
in
the
spanish
habit
immediately
mount
their
steeds
and
while
this
is
done
the
endless
procession
which
precedes
them
has
already
announced
them
the
eye
was
already
wearied
by
the
multitude
of
attendants
and
magistrates
and
by
the
nobility
who
in
stately
fashion
were
moving
along
but
when
the
electoral
envoys
the
hereditary
officers
and
at
last
under
the
canopy
borne
by
twelve
and
senators
the
emperor
in
romantic
costume
and
to
the
left
a
little
behind
him
in
the
spanish
dress
his
son
slowly
floated
along
on
horses
the
eye
was
no
more
sufficient
for
the
sight
one
would
have
liked
to
detain
the
scene
but
for
a
moment
by
a
magic
charm
but
the
glory
passed
on
without
stopping
and
the
space
that
was
scarcely
quitted
was
immediately
filled
again
by
the
crowd
which
poured
in
like
billows
but
now
a
new
pressure
took
place
for
another
approach
from
the
market
to
the
römer
gate
had
to
be
opened
and
a
road
of
planks
to
be
bridged
over
it
on
which
the
train
returning
from
the
cathedral
was
to
walk
what
passed
within
the
cathedral
the
endless
ceremonies
which
precede
and
accompany
the
anointing
the
crowning
the
dubbing
of
knighthood
all
this
we
were
glad
to
hear
told
afterwards
by
those
who
had
sacrificed
much
else
to
be
present
in
the
church
the
rest
of
us
in
the
interim
partook
of
a
frugal
repast
for
in
this
festal
day
we
had
to
be
contented
with
cold
meat
but
on
the
other
hand
the
best
and
oldest
wine
had
beer
brought
out
of
all
the
so
that
in
this
respect
at
least
we
celebrated
the
ancient
festival
in
ancient
style
in
the
square
the
sight
most
worth
seeing
was
now
the
bridge
which
had
been
finished
and
covered
with
orange
and
white
cloth
and
we
who
had
stared
at
the
emperor
first
in
his
carriage
and
then
on
horseback
were
now
to
admire
him
walking
on
foot
singularly
enough
the
last
pleased
us
the
most
for
we
thought
that
in
this
way
he
exhibited
himself
both
in
the
most
natural
and
in
the
most
dignified
manner
older
persons
who
were
present
at
the
coronation
of
francis
the
first
related
that
maria
theresa
beautiful
beyond
measure
had
looked
on
this
solemnity
from
a
balcony
window
of
the
frauenstein
house
close
to
the
römer
as
her
consort
returned
from
the
cathedral
in
his
strange
costume
and
seemed
to
her
so
to
speak
like
a
ghost
of
charlemagne
he
had
as
if
in
jest
raised
both
his
hands
and
shown
her
the
imperial
globe
the
sceptre
and
the
curious
gloves
at
which
she
had
broken
out
into
immoderate
laughter
which
served
for
the
great
delight
and
edification
of
the
crowd
which
was
thus
honoured
with
a
sight
of
the
good
and
natural
matrimonial
understanding
between
the
most
exalted
couple
of
christendom
but
when
the
empress
to
greet
her
consort
waved
her
handkerchief
and
even
shouted
a
loud
to
him
the
enthusiasm
and
exultation
of
the
people
was
raised
to
the
highest
so
that
there
was
no
end
to
the
cheers
of
joy
the
coronation
procession
now
the
sound
of
bells
and
the
van
of
the
long
train
which
gently
made
its
way
over
the
bridge
announced
that
all
was
done
the
attention
was
greater
than
ever
and
the
procession
more
distinct
than
before
particularly
for
us
since
it
now
came
directly
up
to
us
we
saw
it
as
well
as
the
whole
of
the
square
which
was
thronged
with
people
almost
as
if
on
a
only
at
the
end
the
magnificence
was
too
much
crowded
for
the
envoys
the
hereditary
officers
the
emperor
and
king
under
the
canopy
the
three
spiritual
electors
who
immediately
followed
the
schöffen
and
senators
dressed
in
black
the
gold
embroidered
canopy
all
seemed
only
one
mass
which
moved
by
a
single
will
splendidly
harmonious
and
thus
stepping
from
the
temple
amid
the
sound
of
the
bells
beamed
towards
us
as
something
holy
a
ceremony
possesses
an
infinite
charm
we
behold
earthly
majesty
before
our
eyes
surrounded
by
all
the
symbols
of
its
power
but
while
it
bends
before
that
of
heaven
it
brings
to
our
minds
the
communion
of
both
for
even
the
individual
can
only
prove
his
relationship
with
the
deity
by
subjecting
himself
and
adoring
the
rejoicings
which
resounded
from
the
now
spread
likewise
over
the
great
square
and
a
boisterous
burst
forth
from
thousands
upon
thousands
of
throats
and
doubtless
from
as
many
hearts
for
this
grand
festival
was
to
be
the
pledge
of
a
lasting
peace
which
indeed
for
many
a
long
year
actually
blessed
germany
several
days
before
it
had
been
made
known
by
public
proclamation
that
neither
the
bridge
nor
the
eagle
over
the
fountain
were
to
be
exposed
to
the
people
and
were
therefore
not
as
at
other
times
to
be
touched
this
was
done
to
prevent
the
mischief
inevitable
with
such
a
rush
of
persons
but
in
order
to
sacrifice
in
some
degree
to
the
genius
of
the
mob
persons
expressly
appointed
went
behind
the
procession
loosened
the
cloth
from
the
bridge
wound
it
up
like
a
flag
and
threw
it
into
the
air
this
gave
rise
to
no
disaster
but
to
a
laughable
mishap
for
the
cloth
unrolled
itself
in
the
air
and
as
it
fell
covered
a
larger
or
smaller
number
of
persons
those
now
who
took
hold
of
the
ends
and
drew
them
towards
themselves
pulled
all
those
in
the
middle
to
the
ground
enveloped
them
and
teased
them
till
they
tore
or
cut
themselves
through
and
everybody
in
his
own
way
had
borne
off
a
corner
of
the
stuff
made
sacred
by
the
footsteps
of
majesty
i
did
not
long
contemplate
this
rude
sport
but
hastened
from
my
high
position
through
all
sorts
of
little
steps
and
passages
down
to
the
great
römer
stairs
where
the
distinguished
and
majestic
mass
which
had
been
stared
at
from
the
distance
was
to
ascend
in
its
undulating
course
the
crowd
was
not
great
because
the
entrances
to
the
were
well
garrisoned
and
i
fortunately
reached
at
once
the
iron
balustrades
above
now
the
chief
personages
ascended
past
me
while
their
followers
remained
behind
in
the
lower
arched
passages
and
i
could
observe
them
on
the
thrice
broken
stairs
from
all
sides
and
at
last
quite
close
coronation
ceremonies
finally
both
their
majesties
came
up
father
and
son
were
altogether
dressed
like
menæchmi
the
emperor
domestic
robes
of
silk
richly
adorned
with
pearls
and
stones
as
well
as
his
crown
sceptre
and
imperial
orb
struck
the
eye
with
good
effect
for
all
in
them
was
new
and
the
imitation
of
the
antique
was
tasteful
he
moved
too
quite
easily
in
his
attire
and
his
dignified
face
indicated
at
once
the
emperor
and
the
father
the
young
king
on
the
contrary
in
his
monstrous
articles
of
dress
with
the
of
charlemagne
dragged
himself
along
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
disguise
so
that
he
himself
looking
at
his
father
from
time
to
time
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
the
crown
which
it
had
been
necessary
to
line
a
great
deal
stood
out
from
his
head
like
an
overhanging
roof
the
dalmatica
the
stole
well
as
they
had
been
fitted
and
taken
in
by
sewing
presented
by
no
means
an
advantageous
appearance
the
sceptre
and
imperial
orb
excited
some
admiration
but
one
would
for
the
sake
of
a
more
princely
effect
rather
have
seen
a
strong
form
suited
to
the
dress
invested
and
adorned
with
it
scarcely
were
the
gates
of
the
great
hall
closed
behind
these
figures
than
i
hurried
to
my
former
place
which
being
already
occupied
by
others
i
only
regained
with
some
trouble
it
was
precisely
at
the
right
time
that
i
again
took
possession
of
my
window
for
the
most
remarkable
part
of
all
that
was
to
be
seen
in
public
was
just
about
to
take
place
all
the
people
had
turned
towards
the
römer
and
a
reiterated
shout
of
gave
us
to
understand
that
the
emperor
and
king
in
their
vestments
were
showing
themselves
to
the
populace
from
the
balcony
of
the
great
hall
but
they
were
not
alone
to
serve
as
a
spectacle
since
another
strange
spectacle
occurred
before
their
eyes
first
of
all
the
handsome
slender
hereditary
marshal
flung
himself
upon
his
steed
he
had
laid
aside
his
sword
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
vessel
and
a
tin
spatula
in
his
left
he
rode
within
the
barriers
to
the
great
heap
of
oats
sprang
in
filled
the
vessel
to
overflow
smoothed
it
off
and
carried
it
back
again
with
great
dignity
the
imperial
stable
was
now
provided
for
the
hereditary
chamberlain
then
rode
likewise
to
the
spot
and
brought
back
a
basin
with
ewer
and
towel
but
more
entertaining
for
the
spectators
was
the
hereditary
carver
who
came
to
fetch
a
piece
of
the
roasted
ox
he
also
rode
with
a
silver
dish
through
the
barriers
to
the
large
wooden
kitchen
and
came
forth
again
with
his
portion
covered
that
he
might
go
back
to
the
römer
now
it
was
the
turn
of
the
hereditary
cupbearer
who
rode
to
the
fountain
and
fetched
wine
thus
now
was
the
imperial
table
furnished
and
every
eye
waited
upon
the
hereditary
treasurer
who
was
to
throw
about
the
money
he
too
mounted
a
fine
steed
to
the
sides
of
whose
saddle
instead
of
holsters
a
couple
of
splendid
bags
embroidered
with
the
arms
of
the
palatinate
were
suspended
scarcely
had
he
put
himself
in
motion
than
he
plunged
his
hands
into
these
pockets
and
generously
scattered
right
and
left
gold
and
silver
coins
which
on
every
occasion
glittered
merrily
in
the
air
like
metallic
rain
a
thousand
hands
waved
instantly
in
the
air
to
catch
the
gifts
but
hardly
had
the
coins
fallen
than
the
crowd
tumbled
over
each
other
on
the
ground
and
struggled
violently
for
the
pieces
which
might
have
reached
the
earth
as
this
agitation
was
constantly
repeated
on
both
sides
as
the
giver
rode
forwards
it
afforded
the
spectators
a
very
diverting
sight
it
was
most
lively
at
the
close
when
he
threw
out
the
bags
themselves
and
everybody
tried
to
catch
this
highest
prize
their
majesties
had
retired
from
the
balcony
and
another
offering
was
to
be
made
to
the
mob
who
on
such
occasions
would
rather
steal
the
gifts
than
receive
them
tranquilly
and
gratefully
the
custom
prevailed
in
more
rude
and
uncouth
times
of
giving
up
to
the
people
on
the
spot
the
oats
as
soon
as
the
hereditary
marshal
had
taken
away
his
share
the
fountain
and
the
kitchen
after
the
and
the
carver
had
performed
their
offices
but
this
time
to
guard
against
all
mischief
order
and
moderation
were
preserved
as
far
as
possible
but
the
old
malicious
jokes
that
when
one
filled
a
sack
with
oats
another
cut
a
hole
in
it
with
sallies
of
the
kind
were
revived
about
the
roasted
ox
a
serious
battle
on
this
occasion
as
usual
was
waged
this
could
only
be
contested
two
guilds
the
butchers
and
the
had
according
to
ancient
custom
again
stationed
themselves
so
that
the
monstrous
roast
must
fall
to
one
of
the
two
the
butchers
believed
that
they
had
the
best
right
to
an
ox
which
they
provided
entire
for
the
kitchen
the
on
the
other
hand
laid
claim
because
the
kitchen
was
built
near
the
abode
of
their
guild
and
because
they
had
gained
the
victory
the
last
time
the
horns
of
the
captured
steer
still
projecting
from
the
latticed
of
their
guild
and
as
a
sign
of
victory
both
these
companies
had
very
strong
and
able
members
but
which
of
them
conquered
this
time
i
no
longer
remember
the
ox
and
the
wooden
kitchen
but
as
a
festival
of
this
kind
must
always
close
with
something
dangerous
and
frightful
it
was
really
a
terrible
moment
when
the
wooden
kitchen
itself
was
made
a
prize
the
roof
of
it
swarmed
instantly
with
men
no
one
knowing
how
they
got
there
the
boards
were
torn
loose
and
pitched
down
so
that
one
could
not
help
supposing
particularly
at
a
distance
that
each
would
kill
a
few
of
those
pressing
to
the
spot
in
a
trice
the
hut
was
unroofed
and
single
individuals
hung
to
the
beams
and
rafters
in
order
to
pull
them
also
out
of
their
joinings
nay
many
floated
above
upon
the
posts
which
had
been
already
sawn
off
below
and
the
whole
skeleton
moving
backwards
and
forwards
threatened
to
fall
in
sensitive
persons
turned
their
eyes
away
and
everybody
expected
a
great
calamity
but
we
did
not
hear
of
any
mischief
and
the
whole
affair
though
impetuous
and
violent
had
passed
off
happily
everybody
knew
now
that
the
emperor
and
king
would
return
from
the
cabinet
whither
they
had
retired
from
the
balcony
and
feast
in
the
great
hall
of
the
römer
we
had
been
able
to
admire
the
arrangements
made
for
it
the
day
before
and
my
most
anxious
wish
was
if
possible
to
look
in
i
repaired
therefore
by
the
usual
path
to
the
great
staircase
which
stands
directly
opposite
the
door
of
the
hall
here
i
gazed
at
the
distinguished
personages
who
this
day
acted
as
the
servants
of
the
head
of
the
empire
counts
all
splendidly
dressed
passed
me
carrying
the
dishes
from
the
kitchen
so
that
the
contrast
between
their
dignity
and
their
occupation
might
well
be
bewildering
to
a
boy
the
crowd
was
not
great
but
considering
the
little
space
sufficiently
perceptible
the
was
guarded
while
those
who
were
authorised
went
frequently
in
and
out
i
saw
one
of
the
palatine
domestic
officials
whom
i
asked
whether
he
could
not
take
me
in
with
him
he
did
not
deliberate
long
but
gave
me
one
of
the
silver
vessels
he
just
then
bore
which
he
could
do
so
much
the
more
as
i
was
neatly
clad
and
thus
i
reached
the
sanctuary
the
palatine
buffet
stood
to
the
left
directly
by
the
door
and
with
some
steps
i
placed
myself
on
the
elevation
of
it
behind
the
barriers
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
immediately
by
the
windows
raised
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
and
under
canopies
sat
the
emperor
and
king
in
their
robes
but
the
crown
and
sceptre
lay
at
some
distance
behind
them
on
gold
cushions
the
three
spiritual
electors
their
buffets
behind
them
had
taken
their
places
on
single
elevations
the
elector
of
mentz
opposite
their
majesties
the
elector
of
treves
at
the
right
and
the
elector
of
cologne
at
the
left
this
upper
part
of
the
hall
was
imposing
and
cheerful
to
behold
and
excited
the
remark
that
the
spiritual
power
likes
to
keep
as
long
as
possible
with
the
ruler
on
the
contrary
the
buffets
and
tables
of
all
the
temporal
electors
which
were
indeed
magnificently
ornamented
but
without
occupants
made
one
think
of
the
misunderstanding
which
had
gradually
arisen
for
centuries
between
them
and
the
head
of
the
empire
their
ambassadors
had
already
withdrawn
to
eat
in
a
and
if
the
greater
part
of
the
hall
assumed
a
sort
of
spectral
appearance
by
so
many
invisible
guests
being
so
magnificently
attended
a
large
unfurnished
table
in
the
middle
was
still
more
sad
to
look
upon
for
there
also
many
covers
stood
empty
because
all
those
who
had
certainly
a
right
to
sit
there
had
for
appearance
sake
kept
away
that
on
the
greatest
day
of
honour
they
might
not
renounce
any
of
their
honour
if
indeed
they
were
then
to
be
found
in
the
city
neither
my
years
nor
the
mass
of
present
objects
allowed
me
to
make
many
reflections
i
strove
to
see
all
as
much
as
possible
and
when
the
dessert
was
brought
in
and
the
ambassadors
to
pay
their
court
i
sought
the
open
air
and
contrived
to
refresh
myself
with
good
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
after
a
day
and
to
prepare
for
the
illumination
in
the
evening
the
illuminations
this
brilliant
night
i
purposed
celebrating
in
a
right
hearty
way
for
i
had
agreed
with
gretchen
and
pylades
and
his
mistress
that
we
should
meet
somewhere
at
nightfall
the
city
was
already
resplendent
at
every
end
and
corner
when
i
met
my
beloved
i
offered
gretchen
my
arm
we
went
from
one
quarter
to
another
and
found
ourselves
very
happy
in
each
other
society
the
cousins
at
first
were
also
of
out
party
but
were
afterwards
lost
in
the
multitude
of
people
before
the
houses
of
some
of
the
ambassadors
where
magnificent
illuminations
were
exhibited
those
of
the
were
distinguished
it
was
as
clear
as
day
lest
i
should
be
recognised
i
had
disguised
myself
to
a
certain
extent
and
gretchen
did
not
find
it
amiss
we
admired
the
various
brilliant
representations
and
the
structures
of
flame
by
which
each
ambassador
strove
to
outshine
the
others
but
prince
esterhazy
arrangements
surpassed
all
the
rest
our
little
company
were
in
raptures
both
with
the
invention
and
the
execution
and
we
were
just
about
to
enjoy
this
in
detail
when
the
cousins
again
met
us
and
spoke
to
us
of
the
glorious
illumination
with
which
the
brandenburg
ambassador
had
adorned
his
quarters
we
were
not
displeased
at
taking
the
long
way
from
the
rossmarkt
to
the
saalhof
but
found
that
we
had
been
villanously
hoaxed
the
saalhof
is
towards
the
maine
a
regular
and
handsome
structure
but
the
part
in
the
direction
of
the
city
is
exceedingly
old
irregular
and
unsightly
small
windows
agreeing
neither
in
form
nor
size
neither
in
a
line
nor
placed
at
equal
distances
gates
and
doors
arranged
without
symmetry
a
mostly
turned
into
shops
it
forms
a
confused
outside
which
is
never
observed
by
any
one
now
here
this
accidental
irregular
unconnected
architecture
had
been
followed
and
every
window
every
door
every
opening
was
surrounded
by
lamps
as
indeed
can
be
done
with
a
house
but
here
the
most
wretched
and
of
all
façades
was
thus
quite
incredibly
placed
in
the
clearest
light
did
one
amuse
oneself
with
this
as
with
the
jests
of
the
pagliasso
though
not
without
scruple
since
everybody
must
recognise
something
intentional
in
it
just
as
people
had
before
glossed
over
the
previous
external
deportment
of
von
plotho
so
much
prized
in
other
respects
and
when
once
inclined
towards
him
had
admired
him
as
a
wag
who
like
his
king
would
place
himself
above
all
ceremonies
one
nevertheless
gladly
returned
to
the
fairy
kingdom
of
esterhazy
this
eminent
envoy
to
honour
the
day
had
quite
passed
over
his
own
unfavourably
situated
quarters
and
in
their
stead
bad
caused
the
great
esplanade
of
in
the
to
be
decorated
in
the
front
with
a
portal
illuminated
with
colours
and
at
the
back
with
a
still
more
magnificent
prospect
the
entire
enclosure
was
marked
by
lamps
between
the
trees
stood
pyramids
and
spheres
of
light
upon
transparent
pedestals
from
one
tree
to
another
were
stretched
glittering
garlands
on
which
floated
suspended
lights
in
several
places
bread
and
sausages
were
distributed
among
the
people
and
there
was
no
want
of
wine
here
now
four
abreast
we
walked
very
comfortably
up
and
down
and
i
by
gretchen
side
fancied
that
i
really
wandered
in
those
happy
elysian
fields
where
they
pluck
from
the
trees
crystal
cups
that
immediately
fill
themselves
with
the
wine
desired
and
shake
down
fruits
that
change
into
every
dish
at
will
at
last
we
also
felt
such
a
necessity
and
conducted
by
pylades
we
found
a
neat
when
we
encountered
no
more
guests
since
everybody
was
going
about
the
streets
we
were
all
the
better
pleased
and
passed
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
most
happily
and
cheerfully
in
the
feeling
of
friendship
love
and
attachment
when
i
had
accompanied
gretchen
as
far
as
her
door
she
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
it
was
the
first
and
last
time
that
she
granted
me
this
favour
for
alas
i
was
not
to
see
her
again
the
next
morning
while
i
was
yet
in
bed
my
mother
entered
in
trouble
and
anxiety
it
was
easy
to
see
when
she
was
at
all
distressed
get
up
she
said
and
prepare
yourself
for
something
unpleasant
it
has
come
out
that
you
frequent
very
bad
company
and
have
involved
yourself
in
very
dangerous
and
bad
affairs
your
father
is
beside
himself
and
we
have
only
been
able
to
get
thus
much
from
him
that
he
will
investigate
the
affair
by
means
of
a
third
party
remain
in
your
chamber
and
await
what
may
happen
councillor
schneider
will
come
to
you
he
has
the
commission
both
from
your
father
and
from
the
authorities
for
the
matter
is
already
prosecuted
and
may
take
a
very
bad
turn
goethe
in
trouble
i
saw
that
they
took
the
affair
for
much
worse
than
it
was
yet
i
felt
myself
not
a
little
disquieted
even
if
only
the
actual
state
of
things
should
be
detected
my
old
friend
finally
entered
with
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
said
i
am
heartily
sorry
to
come
to
you
on
such
an
affair
i
could
not
have
supposed
that
you
could
go
astray
so
far
but
what
will
not
wicked
companions
and
bad
example
do
thus
can
a
young
inexperienced
man
be
led
step
by
step
into
crime
i
am
conscious
of
no
crime
i
replied
and
as
little
of
having
frequented
bad
company
the
question
now
is
not
one
of
defence
said
he
interrupting
me
but
of
investigation
and
on
your
part
of
an
upright
confession
what
do
you
want
to
know
retorted
i
he
seated
himself
drew
out
a
paper
and
began
to
question
me
have
you
not
recommended
to
your
grandfather
as
a
candidate
for
the
place
i
answered
yes
where
did
you
become
acquainted
with
him
in
my
walks
in
what
company
i
started
for
i
would
not
willingly
betray
my
friends
silence
will
not
do
now
he
continued
for
all
is
sufficiently
known
what
is
known
then
said
i
that
this
man
has
been
introduced
to
you
by
others
like
him
in
fact
by
here
he
named
three
persons
whom
i
had
never
seen
nor
known
which
i
immediately
explained
to
the
questioner
you
pretend
he
resumed
not
to
know
these
men
and
have
yet
had
frequent
meetings
with
them
not
in
the
least
i
replied
for
as
i
have
said
except
the
first
i
do
not
know
one
of
them
and
even
him
i
have
never
seen
in
a
house
have
you
not
often
been
in
street
never
i
replied
this
was
not
entirely
conformable
to
the
truth
i
had
once
accompanied
pylades
to
his
sweetheart
who
lived
in
that
street
but
we
had
entered
by
the
and
remained
in
the
i
therefore
supposed
that
i
might
permit
myself
the
subterfuge
that
i
had
not
been
in
the
street
itself
the
good
man
put
more
questions
all
of
which
i
could
answer
with
a
denial
for
of
all
that
he
wished
to
learn
i
knew
nothing
at
last
he
seemed
to
become
vexed
and
said
you
repay
my
confidence
and
very
badly
i
come
to
save
you
you
can
not
deny
that
you
have
composed
letters
for
these
people
themselves
or
for
their
accomplices
have
furnished
them
writings
and
have
thus
been
accessory
to
their
evil
acts
for
the
question
is
of
nothing
less
than
of
forged
papers
false
wills
counterfeit
bonds
and
things
of
the
sort
i
come
not
only
as
a
friend
of
the
family
i
come
in
the
name
and
by
order
of
the
magistrates
who
in
consideration
of
your
connexions
and
youth
would
spare
you
and
some
other
young
persons
who
like
you
have
been
lured
into
the
net
it
was
strange
to
me
that
among
the
persons
he
named
none
of
those
with
whom
i
had
been
intimate
were
found
the
circumstances
touched
without
agreeing
and
i
could
still
hope
to
save
my
young
friends
but
the
good
man
grew
more
and
more
urgent
i
could
not
deny
that
i
had
come
home
late
many
nights
that
i
had
contrived
to
have
a
made
that
i
had
been
seen
at
public
places
more
than
once
with
persons
of
low
rank
and
suspicious
looks
that
some
girls
were
mixed
up
in
the
affair
in
short
everything
seemed
to
be
discovered
but
the
names
this
gave
me
courage
to
persist
steadfastly
in
my
silence
do
not
said
my
excellent
friend
let
me
go
away
from
you
the
affair
allows
of
no
delay
immediately
after
me
another
will
come
who
will
not
grant
you
so
much
scope
do
not
make
the
matter
which
is
bad
enough
worse
by
your
obstinacy
i
represented
very
vividly
to
myself
the
good
cousins
and
particularly
gretchen
i
saw
them
arrested
tried
punished
disgraced
and
then
it
went
through
my
soul
like
a
flash
of
lightning
that
the
cousins
though
they
always
observed
integrity
towards
me
might
have
engaged
in
such
bad
affairs
at
least
the
oldest
who
never
quite
pleased
me
who
came
home
later
and
later
and
had
little
to
tell
of
a
cheerful
sort
still
i
kept
back
my
confession
personally
said
i
i
am
conscious
of
nothing
evil
and
can
rest
satisfied
on
that
side
but
it
is
not
impossible
that
those
with
whom
i
have
associated
may
have
been
guilty
of
some
daring
or
illegal
act
they
may
be
sought
found
convicted
punished
i
have
hitherto
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
and
will
not
do
any
wrong
to
those
who
have
behaved
well
and
kindly
to
me
he
did
not
let
me
finish
but
exclaimed
with
some
agitation
yes
they
will
be
found
out
these
villains
met
in
three
houses
he
named
the
streets
he
pointed
out
the
houses
and
unfortunately
among
them
was
the
one
to
which
i
used
to
go
the
first
nest
is
already
broken
up
and
at
this
moment
so
are
the
two
others
in
a
few
hours
the
whole
will
be
clear
avoid
by
a
flunk
confession
a
judicial
inquiry
a
confrontation
and
all
other
disagreeable
matters
the
house
was
known
and
marked
now
i
deemed
silence
useless
nay
considering
the
innocence
of
our
meetings
i
could
hope
to
be
still
more
useful
to
them
than
to
myself
sit
down
i
exclaimed
fetching
him
back
from
the
door
i
will
tell
all
and
at
once
lighten
your
heart
and
mine
only
one
thing
i
ask
henceforth
let
there
be
no
doubt
of
my
veracity
goethe
distress
i
soon
told
my
friend
the
whole
progress
of
the
affair
and
was
at
first
calm
and
collected
but
the
more
i
brought
to
mind
and
pictured
to
myself
the
persons
objects
and
events
so
many
innocent
pleasures
and
charming
enjoyments
and
was
forced
to
depose
as
before
a
criminal
court
the
more
did
the
most
painful
feeling
increase
so
that
at
last
i
burst
forth
in
tears
and
gave
myself
up
to
unrestrained
passion
the
family
friend
who
hoped
that
now
the
real
secret
was
coming
to
light
for
he
regarded
my
distress
as
a
symptom
that
i
was
on
the
point
of
confessing
with
repugnance
something
monstrous
sought
to
pacify
me
as
with
him
the
discovery
was
the
matter
in
this
he
only
partly
succeeded
but
so
far
however
that
i
could
eke
out
my
story
to
the
end
though
satisfied
of
the
innocence
of
the
proceedings
he
was
still
doubtful
to
some
extent
and
put
further
questions
to
me
which
excited
me
afresh
and
transported
me
with
pain
and
rage
i
asserted
finally
that
i
had
nothing
more
to
say
and
well
knew
that
i
need
fear
nothing
for
i
was
innocent
of
a
good
family
and
well
reputed
but
that
they
might
be
just
as
guiltless
without
having
it
recognised
or
being
otherwise
favoured
i
declared
at
the
same
time
that
if
they
were
not
spared
like
myself
that
if
their
follies
were
not
regarded
with
indulgence
and
their
faults
pardoned
that
if
anything
in
the
least
harsh
or
unjust
happened
to
them
i
would
do
myself
a
mischief
and
no
one
should
prevent
me
in
this
too
my
friend
tried
to
pacify
me
but
i
did
not
trust
him
and
was
when
he
quitted
me
at
last
in
a
most
terrible
state
i
now
reproached
myself
for
having
told
the
affair
and
brought
all
the
positions
to
light
i
foresaw
that
our
childish
actions
our
youthful
inclinations
and
confidences
might
be
quite
differently
interpreted
and
that
i
might
perhaps
involve
the
excellent
pylades
in
the
matter
and
render
him
very
unhappy
all
these
images
pressed
vividly
one
after
the
other
before
my
soul
sharpened
and
spurred
my
distress
so
that
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
sorrow
i
cast
myself
at
full
length
upon
the
floor
and
moistened
it
with
my
tears
i
know
not
how
long
i
might
have
lain
when
my
sister
entered
was
frightened
at
my
gestures
and
did
all
that
she
could
to
raise
me
up
she
told
me
that
a
person
connected
with
the
magistracy
had
waited
below
with
my
father
for
the
return
of
the
family
friend
and
that
after
they
had
been
closeted
together
for
some
time
both
the
gentlemen
had
departed
had
talked
to
each
other
with
apparent
satisfaction
and
had
even
laughed
she
believed
that
she
had
heard
the
words
it
is
all
right
the
of
no
consequence
indeed
i
broke
out
the
affair
is
of
no
consequence
for
me
for
us
for
i
have
committed
no
crime
and
if
i
had
they
would
contrive
to
help
me
through
but
the
others
the
others
i
cried
who
will
stand
by
them
my
sister
tried
to
comfort
me
by
circumstantially
arguing
that
if
those
of
higher
rank
were
to
be
saved
a
veil
must
also
be
cast
over
the
faults
of
the
more
lowly
all
this
was
of
no
avail
she
had
scarcely
left
than
i
again
abandoned
myself
to
my
grief
and
ever
recalled
alternately
the
images
both
of
my
affection
and
passion
and
of
the
present
and
possible
misfortune
i
repeated
to
myself
tale
after
tale
saw
only
unhappiness
following
unhappiness
and
did
not
fail
in
particular
to
make
gretchen
and
myself
truly
wretched
the
family
friend
had
ordered
me
to
remain
in
my
room
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
one
but
the
family
this
was
just
what
i
wanted
for
i
found
myself
best
alone
my
mother
and
sister
visited
me
from
time
to
time
and
did
not
fail
to
assist
me
vigorously
with
all
sorts
of
good
consolation
nay
even
on
the
second
day
they
came
in
the
name
of
my
father
who
was
now
better
informed
to
offer
me
a
perfect
amnesty
which
indeed
i
gratefully
accepted
but
the
proposal
that
i
should
go
out
with
him
and
look
at
the
insignia
of
the
empire
which
were
now
exposed
to
the
curious
i
stubbornly
rejected
and
i
asserted
that
i
wanted
to
know
nothing
either
of
the
world
or
of
the
roman
empire
till
i
was
informed
how
that
distressing
affair
which
for
me
could
have
no
further
consequences
had
turned
out
for
my
poor
acquaintance
they
had
nothing
to
say
on
this
head
and
left
me
alone
yet
the
next
day
some
further
attempts
were
made
to
get
me
out
of
the
house
and
excite
in
me
a
sympathy
for
the
public
ceremonies
in
vain
neither
the
great
nor
what
happened
on
the
occasion
of
so
many
elevations
of
rank
nor
the
public
table
of
the
emperor
and
king
in
short
nothing
could
move
me
the
elector
of
the
palatinate
might
come
and
wait
on
both
their
majesties
these
might
visit
the
electors
the
last
electoral
sitting
might
be
attended
for
the
despatch
of
business
in
arrear
and
the
renewal
of
the
electoral
union
nothing
could
call
me
forth
from
my
passionate
solitude
i
let
the
bells
ring
for
the
rejoicings
the
emperor
repair
to
the
capuchin
church
the
electors
and
emperor
depart
without
on
that
account
moving
one
step
from
my
chamber
the
final
cannonading
immoderate
as
it
might
be
did
not
arouse
me
and
as
the
smoke
of
the
powder
dispersed
and
the
sound
died
away
so
had
all
this
glory
vanished
from
my
soul
goethe
illness
i
now
experienced
no
satisfaction
but
in
chewing
the
cud
of
my
misery
and
in
a
thousandfold
imaginary
multiplication
of
it
my
whole
inventive
faculty
my
poetry
and
rhetoric
had
cast
themselves
on
this
diseased
spot
and
threatened
precisely
by
means
of
this
vitality
to
involve
body
and
soul
into
an
incurable
disorder
in
this
melancholy
condition
nothing
more
seemed
to
me
worth
a
desire
nothing
worth
a
wish
an
infinite
yearning
indeed
seized
me
at
times
to
know
how
it
had
gone
with
my
poor
friends
and
my
beloved
what
had
been
the
result
of
a
stricter
scrutiny
how
far
they
were
implicated
in
those
crimes
or
had
been
found
guiltless
this
also
i
circumstantially
painted
to
myself
in
the
most
various
ways
and
did
not
fail
to
hold
them
as
innocent
and
truly
unfortunate
sometimes
i
longed
to
see
myself
freed
from
this
uncertainty
and
wrote
vehemently
threatening
letters
to
the
family
friend
insisting
that
he
should
not
withhold
from
me
the
further
progress
of
the
affair
sometimes
i
tore
them
up
again
from
the
fear
of
learning
my
unhappiness
quite
distinctly
and
of
losing
the
principal
consolation
with
which
hitherto
i
had
alternately
tormented
and
supported
myself
thus
i
passed
both
day
and
night
in
great
disquiet
in
raving
and
lassitude
so
that
i
felt
happy
at
last
when
a
bodily
illness
seized
me
with
considerable
violence
when
they
had
to
call
in
the
help
of
a
physician
and
think
of
every
way
to
quiet
me
they
supposed
that
they
could
do
it
generally
by
the
sacred
assurance
that
all
who
were
more
or
less
involved
in
the
guilt
had
been
treated
with
the
greatest
forbearance
that
my
nearest
friends
being
as
good
as
innocent
had
been
dismissed
with
a
slight
reprimand
and
that
gretchen
had
retired
from
the
city
and
had
returned
to
her
own
home
they
lingered
the
most
over
this
last
point
and
i
did
not
take
it
in
the
best
part
for
i
could
discover
in
it
not
a
voluntary
departure
but
only
a
shameful
banishment
my
bodily
and
mental
condition
was
not
improved
by
this
my
distress
now
first
really
began
and
i
had
time
enough
to
torment
myself
by
picturing
the
strangest
romance
of
sad
events
and
an
inevitably
tragical
catastrophe
the
diminutive
of
that
is
to
say
a
poem
written
for
a
certain
occasion
as
a
wedding

german

sixth
book
thus
was
i
driven
alternately
to
assist
and
to
retard
my
recovery
and
a
certain
secret
chagrin
was
now
added
to
my
other
sensations
for
i
plainly
perceived
that
i
was
watched
that
they
were
loth
to
hand
me
any
sealed
paper
without
taking
notice
what
effect
it
produced
whether
i
kept
it
secret
whether
i
laid
it
down
open
and
the
like
i
therefore
conjectured
that
pylades
or
one
of
the
cousins
or
even
gretchen
herself
might
have
attempted
to
write
to
me
either
to
give
or
to
obtain
information
in
addition
to
my
sorrow
i
was
now
for
the
first
time
thoroughly
cross
and
had
again
fresh
opportunities
to
exercise
my
conjectures
and
to
mislead
myself
into
the
strangest
combinations
it
was
not
long
before
they
gave
me
a
special
overseer
fortunately
it
was
a
man
whom
i
loved
and
valued
he
had
held
the
place
of
tutor
in
the
family
of
one
of
our
friends
and
his
former
pupil
had
gone
alone
to
the
university
he
often
visited
me
in
my
sad
condition
and
they
at
last
found
nothing
more
natural
than
to
give
him
a
chamber
next
to
mine
as
he
was
then
to
employ
me
pacify
me
and
as
i
marked
keep
his
eye
upon
me
still
as
i
esteemed
him
from
my
heart
and
had
already
confided
many
things
to
him
though
not
my
affection
for
gretchen
i
determined
so
much
the
more
to
be
perfectly
candid
and
straightforward
with
him
as
it
was
intolerable
to
me
to
live
in
daily
intercourse
with
any
one
and
at
the
same
time
to
stand
on
an
uncertain
constrained
footing
with
him
it
was
not
long
then
before
i
spoke
to
him
about
the
affair
refreshed
myself
by
the
relation
and
repetition
of
the
minutest
circumstances
of
my
past
happiness
and
thus
gained
so
much
that
he
like
a
sensible
man
saw
it
would
be
better
to
make
me
acquainted
with
the
issue
of
the
story
and
that
too
in
its
details
and
particulars
so
that
i
might
be
clear
as
to
the
whole
and
that
with
earnestness
and
zeal
i
might
be
persuaded
of
the
necessity
of
composing
myself
throwing
the
past
behind
me
and
beginning
a
new
life
first
he
confided
to
me
who
the
other
young
people
of
quality
were
who
had
allowed
themselves
to
be
seduced
at
the
outset
into
daring
hoaxes
then
into
sportive
breaches
of
police
afterwards
into
frolicsome
impositions
on
others
and
other
such
dangerous
matters
thus
actually
had
arisen
a
little
conspiracy
which
unprincipled
men
had
joined
who
by
forging
papers
and
counterfeiting
signatures
had
perpetrated
many
criminal
acts
and
had
still
more
criminal
matters
in
preparation
the
cousins
after
whom
i
at
last
impatiently
inquired
had
been
found
to
be
quite
innocent
only
very
generally
acquainted
with
those
others
and
not
at
all
implicated
with
them
my
client
by
recommending
whom
to
my
grandfather
i
had
in
fact
put
people
on
the
scent
was
one
of
the
worst
and
bad
sued
for
that
office
chiefly
that
he
might
undertake
or
conceal
certain
villanies
after
all
this
i
could
at
last
contain
myself
no
longer
and
asked
what
had
become
of
gretchen
for
whom
i
once
for
all
confessed
the
strongest
attachment
my
friend
shook
his
head
and
smiled
make
yourself
easy
replied
he
this
girl
has
passed
her
examination
very
well
and
has
borne
off
honourable
testimony
to
that
effect
they
could
discover
nothing
in
her
but
what
was
good
and
amiable
the
examiners
themselves
were
to
her
and
could
not
refuse
her
desire
of
removing
from
the
city
even
what
she
has
confessed
in
respect
to
you
too
my
friend
does
her
honour
i
have
read
her
deposition
in
the
secret
reports
myself
and
seen
her
signature
the
signature
exclaimed
i
which
makes
me
so
happy
and
so
miserable
what
has
she
confessed
then
what
has
she
subscribed
my
friend
delayed
answering
but
the
cheerfulness
of
his
face
showed
me
that
he
concealed
nothing
dangerous
if
you
must
know
then
replied
he
at
last
when
she
was
interrogated
concerning
you
and
her
intercourse
with
you
she
said
quite
frankly
can
not
deny
that
i
have
seen
him
often
and
with
pleasure
but
i
have
always
treated
him
as
a
child
and
my
affection
for
him
was
truly
that
of
a
sister
in
many
cases
i
have
given
him
good
advice
and
instead
of
instigating
him
to
any
equivocal
action
i
have
hindered
him
from
taking
part
in
wanton
tricks
which
might
have
brought
him
into
trouble
change
of
feeling
towards
gretchen
my
friend
still
went
on
making
gretchen
speak
like
a
governess
but
i
bad
already
for
some
time
ceased
to
listen
to
him
for
i
was
terribly
affronted
that
she
had
set
me
down
in
the
reports
as
a
child
and
believed
myself
at
once
cured
of
all
passion
for
her
i
even
hastily
assured
my
friend
that
all
was
now
over
i
also
spoke
no
more
of
her
named
her
no
more
but
i
could
not
leave
off
the
bad
habit
of
thinking
about
her
and
of
recalling
her
form
her
air
her
demeanour
though
now
in
fact
all
appeared
to
me
in
quite
another
light
i
felt
it
intolerable
that
a
girl
at
the
most
only
a
couple
of
years
older
than
me
should
regard
me
as
a
child
while
i
conceived
i
passed
with
her
for
a
very
sensible
and
clever
youth
her
cold
and
repelling
manner
which
had
before
so
charmed
me
now
seemed
to
me
quite
repugnant
the
familiarities
which
she
had
allowed
herself
to
take
with
me
but
had
not
permitted
me
to
return
were
altogether
odious
yet
all
would
have
been
well
enough
for
me
if
by
subscribing
that
poetical
in
which
she
had
confessed
a
formal
attachment
to
me
she
had
not
given
me
a
right
to
regard
her
as
a
sly
and
selfish
coquette
her
masquerading
it
at
the
milliner
too
no
longer
seemed
to
me
so
innocent
and
i
turned
these
annoying
reflections
over
and
over
within
myself
until
i
had
entirely
stripped
her
of
all
her
amiable
qualities
my
judgment
was
convinced
and
i
thought
i
must
cast
her
away
but
her
image
her
image
gave
me
the
lie
as
often
as
it
again
hovered
before
me
which
indeed
happened
often
enough
nevertheless
this
arrow
with
its
barbed
hooks
was
torn
out
of
my
heart
and
the
question
then
was
how
the
inward
sanative
power
of
youth
could
be
brought
to
one
aid
i
really
put
on
the
man
and
the
first
thing
instantly
laid
aside
was
the
weeping
and
raving
which
i
now
regarded
as
childish
in
the
highest
degree
a
great
stride
for
the
better
for
i
had
often
half
the
night
through
given
myself
up
to
this
grief
with
the
greatest
violence
so
that
at
last
from
my
tears
and
sobbing
i
came
to
such
a
point
that
i
could
scarce
swallow
any
more
the
pleasure
of
eating
and
drinking
became
painful
to
me
and
my
breast
which
was
so
nearly
concerned
seemed
to
suffer
the
vexation
which
i
had
constantly
felt
since
the
discovery
made
me
banish
every
weakness
i
found
it
frightful
that
i
had
sacrificed
sleep
repose
and
health
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
who
was
pleased
to
consider
me
a
babe
and
to
imagine
herself
with
respect
to
me
something
very
much
like
a
nurse
these
depressing
reflections
as
i
was
soon
convinced
were
only
to
be
banished
by
activity
but
of
what
was
i
to
take
hold
i
had
indeed
much
to
make
up
for
in
many
things
and
to
prepare
myself
in
more
than
one
sense
for
the
university
which
i
was
now
to
attend
but
i
relished
and
accomplished
nothing
much
appeared
to
me
familiar
and
trivial
for
grounding
myself
in
several
respects
i
found
neither
strength
within
nor
opportunity
without
and
i
therefore
suffered
myself
to
be
moved
by
the
taste
of
my
good
to
a
study
which
was
altogether
new
and
strange
to
me
and
which
for
a
long
time
offered
me
a
wide
field
of
information
and
thought
my
friend
began
namely
to
make
me
acquainted
with
the
secrets
of
philosophy
he
had
studied
in
jena
under
daries
and
possessing
a
mind
had
acutely
seized
the
relations
of
that
doctrine
which
he
now
sought
to
impart
to
me
but
unfortunately
these
things
would
not
hang
together
in
such
a
fashion
in
my
brain
i
put
questions
which
he
promised
to
answer
afterwards
i
made
demands
which
he
promised
to
satisfy
in
future
but
our
most
important
difference
was
this
that
i
maintained
a
separate
philosophy
was
not
necessary
as
the
whole
of
it
was
already
contained
in
religion
and
poetry
this
he
would
by
no
means
allow
but
rather
tried
to
prove
to
me
that
these
must
first
be
founded
on
philosophy
which
i
stubbornly
denied
and
at
every
step
in
the
progress
of
our
discussions
found
arguments
for
my
opinion
for
as
in
poetry
a
certain
faith
in
the
impossible
and
as
in
religion
a
like
faith
in
the
inscrutable
must
have
a
place
the
philosophers
appeared
to
me
to
be
in
a
very
false
position
who
would
demonstrate
and
explain
both
of
them
from
their
own
field
of
vision
besides
it
was
very
quickly
proved
from
the
history
of
philosophy
that
one
always
sought
a
ground
different
from
that
of
the
other
and
that
the
sceptic
in
the
end
pronounced
everything
groundless
and
useless
history
of
philosophy
however
this
very
history
of
philosophy
which
my
friend
was
compelled
to
go
over
with
me
because
i
could
learn
nothing
from
dogmatical
discourse
amused
me
very
much
but
only
on
this
account
that
one
doctrine
or
opinion
seemed
to
me
as
good
as
another
so
far
at
least
as
i
was
capable
of
penetrating
into
it
with
the
most
ancient
men
and
schools
i
was
best
pleased
because
poetry
religion
and
philosophy
were
completely
combined
into
one
and
i
only
maintained
that
first
opinion
of
mine
with
the
more
animation
when
the
book
of
job
and
the
song
and
proverbs
of
solomon
as
well
as
the
lays
of
orpheus
and
hesiod
seemed
to
bear
valid
witness
in
its
favour
my
friend
had
taken
the
smaller
work
of
brucker
as
the
foundation
of
his
discourse
and
the
further
we
went
on
the
less
i
could
make
of
it
i
could
not
clearly
see
what
the
first
greek
philosophers
would
have
socrates
i
esteemed
as
an
excellent
wise
man
who
in
his
life
and
death
might
well
be
compared
with
christ
his
disciples
on
the
other
hand
seemed
to
me
to
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
apostles
who
disagreed
immediately
after
their
master
death
when
each
manifestly
recognised
only
a
limited
view
as
the
right
one
neither
the
keenness
of
aristotle
nor
the
fulness
of
plato
produced
the
least
fruit
in
me
for
the
stoics
on
the
contrary
i
had
already
conceived
some
affection
and
even
procured
epictetus
whom
i
studied
with
much
interest
my
friend
unwillingly
let
me
have
my
way
in
this
from
which
he
could
not
draw
me
for
in
spite
of
his
varied
studies
he
did
not
know
how
to
bring
the
leading
question
into
a
narrow
compass
he
need
only
have
said
to
me
that
in
life
action
is
everything
and
that
joy
and
sorrow
come
of
themselves
however
youth
should
be
allowed
its
own
course
it
does
not
stick
to
false
maxims
very
long
life
soon
tears
or
charms
it
away
again
the
season
had
become
fine
we
often
went
together
into
the
open
air
and
visited
the
places
of
amusement
which
surrounded
the
city
in
great
numbers
but
it
was
precisely
here
that
matters
went
worse
with
me
for
i
still
saw
the
ghosts
of
the
cousins
everywhere
and
feared
now
here
now
there
to
see
one
of
them
step
forward
even
the
most
indifferent
glances
of
men
annoyed
me
i
had
lost
that
unconscious
happiness
of
wandering
about
unknown
and
unblamed
and
of
thinking
of
no
observer
even
in
the
greatest
crowds
now
hypochondriacal
fancies
began
to
torment
me
as
if
i
attracted
the
attention
of
the
people
as
if
their
eyes
were
turned
on
my
demeanour
to
fix
it
on
their
memories
to
scan
and
to
find
fault
i
therefore
drew
my
friend
into
the
woods
and
while
i
shunned
the
monotonous
firs
i
sought
those
fine
leafy
groves
which
do
not
indeed
spread
far
in
the
district
but
are
yet
of
sufficient
compass
for
a
poor
wounded
heart
to
hide
itself
in
the
remotest
depth
of
the
forest
i
sought
out
a
solemn
spot
where
the
oldest
oaks
and
beeches
formed
a
large
noble
shaded
space
the
ground
was
somewhat
sloping
and
made
the
worth
of
the
old
trunks
only
the
more
perceptible
round
this
open
circle
closed
the
densest
thickets
from
which
the
mossy
rocks
mightily
and
venerably
peered
forth
and
made
a
rapid
fall
for
a
copious
brook
scarcely
had
i
compelled
my
friend
hither
who
would
rather
have
been
in
the
open
country
by
the
stream
among
men
than
he
playfully
assured
me
that
i
showed
myself
a
true
german
he
related
to
me
circumstantially
out
of
tacitus
how
our
ancestors
found
pleasure
in
the
feelings
which
nature
so
provides
for
us
in
such
solitudes
with
her
inartificial
architecture
he
had
not
been
long
discoursing
of
this
when
i
exclaimed
oh
why
did
not
this
precious
spot
lie
in
a
deeper
wilderness
why
may
we
not
train
a
hedge
around
it
to
hallow
and
separate
from
the
world
both
it
and
ourselves
surely
there
is
no
more
beautiful
adoration
of
the
deity
than
that
which
needs
no
image
but
which
springs
up
in
our
bosom
merely
from
the
intercourse
with
nature
what
i
then
felt
is
still
present
to
me
what
i
said
i
know
not
how
to
recall
thus
much
however
is
certain
that
the
undetermined
feelings
of
youth
and
of
uncultivated
nations
are
alone
adapted
to
the
sublime
which
if
it
is
to
be
excited
in
us
through
external
objects
formless
or
moulded
into
incomprehensible
forms
must
surround
us
with
a
greatness
to
which
we
are
not
equal
all
men
more
or
less
feel
such
a
disposition
of
the
soul
and
seek
to
satisfy
this
noble
necessity
in
various
ways
but
as
the
sublime
is
easily
produced
by
twilight
and
night
when
objects
are
blended
it
is
on
the
other
hand
scared
away
by
the
day
which
separates
and
sunders
everything
and
so
must
it
also
be
destroyed
by
every
increase
of
cultivation
if
it
be
not
fortunate
enough
to
take
refuge
with
the
beautiful
and
unite
itself
closely
with
it
by
which
both
become
equally
undying
and
indestructible
the
brief
moments
of
such
enjoyments
were
still
more
shortened
by
my
meditative
friend
but
when
i
turned
back
into
the
world
it
was
altogether
in
vain
that
i
sought
among
the
bright
and
barren
objects
around
again
to
arouse
such
feelings
within
me
nay
i
could
scarce
retain
even
the
remembrance
of
them
my
heart
however
was
too
far
spoiled
to
be
able
to
compose
itself
it
had
loved
and
the
object
was
snatched
away
from
it
it
had
lived
and
life
to
it
was
embittered
a
friend
who
makes
it
too
perceptible
that
he
designs
to
form
you
excites
no
feeling
of
comfort
while
a
woman
who
is
forming
you
while
she
seems
to
spoil
you
is
adored
as
a
heavenly
being
but
that
form
in
which
the
idea
of
beauty
manifested
itself
to
me
had
vanished
far
away
it
often
visited
me
under
the
shade
of
my
oak
trees
but
i
could
not
hold
it
fast
and
i
felt
a
powerful
impulse
to
seek
something
similar
in
the
distance
drawing
from
nature
i
had
imperceptibly
accustomed
nay
compelled
my
friend
and
overseer
to
leave
me
alone
for
even
in
my
sacred
grove
those
undefined
gigantic
feelings
were
not
sufficient
for
me
the
eye
was
above
all
others
the
organ
by
which
i
seized
the
world
i
had
from
childhood
lived
among
painters
and
had
accustomed
myself
to
look
at
objects
as
they
did
with
reference
to
art
now
i
was
left
to
myself
and
to
solitude
this
gift
half
natural
half
acquired
made
its
appearance
wherever
i
looked
i
saw
a
picture
and
whatever
struck
me
whatever
gave
me
delight
i
washed
to
fix
and
began
in
the
most
awkward
manner
to
draw
after
nature
in
this
i
lacked
nothing
less
than
everything
yet
though
without
any
technical
means
i
obstinately
persisted
in
trying
to
imitate
the
most
magnificent
things
that
offered
themselves
to
my
sight
thus
to
be
sure
i
acquired
a
great
attention
to
objects
but
i
only
seized
them
as
a
whole
so
far
as
they
produced
an
effect
and
little
as
nature
had
meant
me
for
a
descriptive
poet
just
as
little
would
she
grant
me
the
capacity
of
a
draughtsman
for
details
since
however
this
was
the
only
way
left
me
of
expressing
myself
i
stuck
to
it
with
so
much
stubbornness
nay
even
with
melancholy
that
i
always
continued
my
labours
the
more
zealously
the
less
i
saw
they
produced
but
i
will
not
deny
that
there
was
a
certain
mixture
of
roguery
for
i
had
remarked
that
if
i
chose
for
an
irksome
study
a
old
trunk
to
the
hugely
curved
roots
of
which
clung
fern
combined
with
twinkling
maidenhair
my
friend
who
knew
from
experience
that
i
should
not
be
disengaged
in
less
than
an
hour
commonly
resolved
to
seek
with
his
books
some
other
pleasant
little
spot
now
nothing
disturbed
me
in
prosecuting
my
taste
which
was
so
much
the
more
active
since
my
paper
was
endeared
to
me
by
the
circumstance
that
i
had
accustomed
myself
to
see
in
it
not
so
much
what
stood
upon
it
as
what
i
had
been
thinking
of
at
any
time
and
hour
when
i
drew
thus
plants
and
flowers
of
the
commonest
kind
may
form
a
charming
diary
for
us
because
nothing
that
calls
back
the
remembrance
of
a
happy
moment
can
be
insignificant
and
even
now
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
destroy
as
worthless
many
things
of
the
kind
that
have
remained
to
me
from
different
epochs
because
they
transport
me
immediately
to
those
times
which
i
remember
with
melancholy
indeed
but
not
unwillingly
but
if
such
drawings
may
have
had
anything
of
interest
in
themselves
they
were
indebted
for
this
advantage
to
the
sympathy
and
attention
of
my
father
he
informed
by
my
overseer
that
i
had
become
gradually
reconciled
to
my
condition
and
in
particular
had
applied
myself
passionately
to
drawing
from
nature
was
very
well
satisfied
partly
because
he
himself
set
a
high
value
on
drawing
and
painting
partly
because
gossip
seekatz
had
once
said
to
him
that
it
was
a
pity
i
was
not
destined
for
a
painter
but
here
again
the
peculiarities
of
the
father
and
son
came
into
conflict
for
it
was
almost
impossible
for
me
to
make
use
of
a
good
white
perfectly
clean
sheet
of
paper
grey
old
leaves
even
if
scribbled
over
on
one
side
already
charmed
me
most
just
as
if
my
awkwardness
had
feared
the
touchstone
of
a
white
ground
nor
were
any
of
my
drawings
quite
finished
and
how
should
i
have
executed
a
whole
which
indeed
i
saw
with
my
eyes
but
did
not
comprehend
and
how
an
individual
object
which
i
had
neither
skill
nor
patience
to
follow
out
the
pedagogism
of
my
father
on
this
point
too
was
really
to
be
admired
he
kindly
asked
for
my
attempts
and
drew
lines
round
every
imperfect
sketch
he
wished
by
this
means
to
compel
me
to
completeness
and
fulness
of
detail
the
irregular
leaves
he
cut
straight
and
thus
made
the
beginning
of
a
collection
in
which
he
wished
at
some
future
time
to
rejoice
at
the
progress
of
his
son
it
was
therefore
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
him
when
my
wild
restless
disposition
sent
me
roving
about
the
country
he
rather
seemed
pleased
when
i
brought
back
a
parcel
of
drawings
on
which
he
could
exercise
his
patience
and
in
some
measure
strengthen
his
hopes
they
no
longer
said
that
i
might
relapse
into
my
former
attachments
and
connexions
they
left
me
by
degrees
perfect
liberty
by
accidental
inducements
and
in
accidental
society
i
undertook
many
journeys
to
the
which
from
my
childhood
had
stood
so
distant
and
solemn
before
me
thus
we
visited
homburg
kroneburg
ascended
the
feldberg
from
which
the
prospect
invited
us
still
further
and
further
into
the
distance
königstein
too
was
not
left
unvisited
wiesbaden
schwalbach
with
its
environs
occupied
us
many
days
we
reached
the
rhine
which
from
the
heights
we
had
seen
winding
along
far
off
mentz
astonished
us
but
could
not
chain
a
youthful
mind
which
was
running
into
the
open
country
we
were
delighted
with
the
situation
of
biberich
and
contented
and
happy
we
resumed
our
journey
home
this
whole
tour
from
which
my
father
had
promised
himself
many
a
drawing
might
have
been
almost
without
fruit
for
what
taste
what
talent
what
experience
does
it
not
require
to
seize
an
extensive
landscape
as
a
picture
i
was
again
imperceptibly
drawn
into
a
narrow
compass
from
which
i
derived
some
profit
for
i
met
no
ruined
castle
no
piece
of
wall
which
pointed
to
antiquity
that
i
did
not
think
an
object
worthy
of
my
pencil
and
imitate
as
well
as
i
could
even
the
stone
of
drusus
on
the
ramparts
of
mentz
i
copied
at
some
risk
and
with
inconveniences
which
every
one
must
experience
who
wishes
to
carry
home
with
him
some
pictorial
reminiscences
of
his
travels
unfortunately
i
had
again
taken
with
me
nothing
but
the
most
miserable
common
paper
and
had
clumsily
crowded
several
objects
into
one
sheet
but
my
paternal
teacher
was
not
perplexed
at
this
he
cut
the
sheets
apart
had
the
parts
which
belonged
to
each
other
put
together
by
the
bookbinder
surrounded
the
single
leaves
with
lines
and
thus
actually
compelled
me
to
draw
the
outline
of
different
mountains
up
to
the
margin
and
to
fill
up
the
foreground
with
some
weeds
and
stones
if
his
faithful
endeavours
could
not
increase
my
talent
nevertheless
this
mark
of
his
love
of
order
had
upon
me
a
secret
influence
which
afterwards
manifested
itself
vigorously
in
more
ways
than
one
goethe
sister
from
such
rambling
excursions
undertaken
partly
for
pleasure
partly
for
art
and
which
could
be
performed
in
a
short
time
and
often
repeated
i
was
again
drawn
home
and
that
by
a
magnet
which
always
acted
upon
me
strongly
this
was
my
sister
she
only
a
year
younger
than
i
had
lived
my
whole
conscious
period
of
life
with
me
and
was
thus
bound
to
me
by
the
closest
ties
to
these
natural
causes
was
added
a
forcible
motive
which
proceeded
from
our
domestic
position
a
father
certainly
affectionate
and
but
grave
who
because
he
cherished
within
a
very
tender
heart
externally
with
incredible
consistency
maintained
a
brazen
sternness
that
he
might
attain
the
end
of
giving
his
children
the
best
education
and
of
building
up
regulating
and
preserving
his
house
a
mother
on
the
other
hand
as
yet
almost
a
child
who
first
grew
up
to
consciousness
with
and
in
her
two
eldest
children
these
three
as
they
looked
at
the
world
with
healthy
eyes
capable
of
life
and
desiring
present
enjoyment
this
contradiction
floating
in
the
family
increased
with
years
my
father
followed
out
his
views
unshaken
and
uninterrupted
the
mother
and
children
could
not
give
up
their
feelings
their
claims
their
wishes
under
these
circumstances
it
was
natural
that
brother
and
sister
should
attach
themselves
close
to
each
other
and
adhere
to
their
mother
that
they
might
singly
snatch
the
pleasures
forbidden
as
a
whole
but
since
the
hours
of
solitude
and
toil
were
very
long
compared
to
the
moments
of
recreation
and
enjoyment
especially
for
my
sister
who
could
never
leave
the
house
for
so
long
a
time
as
i
could
the
necessity
she
felt
for
entertaining
herself
with
me
was
still
sharpened
by
the
sense
of
longing
with
which
she
accompanied
me
to
a
distance
and
as
in
our
first
years
playing
and
learning
growth
and
education
had
been
quite
common
to
both
of
us
so
that
we
might
well
have
been
taken
for
twins
so
did
this
community
this
confidence
remain
during
the
development
of
our
physical
and
moral
powers
that
interest
of
youth
that
amazement
at
the
awakening
of
sensual
impulses
which
clothe
themselves
in
mental
forms
of
mental
necessities
which
clothe
themselves
in
sensual
images
all
the
reflections
upon
these
which
obscure
rather
than
enlighten
us
as
the
fog
covers
over
and
does
not
illumine
the
vale
from
which
it
is
about
to
rise
the
many
errors
and
aberrations
springing
therefrom
all
these
the
brother
and
sister
shared
and
endured
hand
in
hand
and
were
the
less
enlightened
as
to
their
strange
condition
as
the
nearer
they
wished
to
approach
each
other
to
clear
up
their
minds
the
more
forcibly
did
the
sacred
awe
of
their
close
relationship
keep
them
apart
reluctantly
do
i
mention
in
general
terms
what
i
undertook
to
set
forth
years
ago
without
being
able
to
accomplish
it
as
i
lost
this
beloved
incomprehensible
being
but
too
soon
i
felt
inducement
enough
to
make
her
worth
present
to
me
and
thus
arose
in
me
the
conception
of
a
poetic
whole
in
which
it
might
be
possible
to
exhibit
her
individuality
but
for
this
no
other
form
could
be
devised
than
that
of
the
richardsonian
novels
only
by
the
minutest
detail
by
endless
particularities
which
bear
vividly
all
the
character
of
the
whole
and
as
they
spring
up
from
a
wonderful
depth
give
some
feeling
of
that
depth
only
in
such
a
manner
would
it
have
been
in
some
degree
possible
to
give
a
representation
of
this
remarkable
personality
for
the
spring
can
be
apprehended
only
while
it
is
flowing
but
from
this
beautiful
and
pious
design
as
from
so
many
others
the
tumult
of
the
world
drew
me
back
and
nothing
now
remains
for
me
but
to
call
up
for
a
moment
that
blessed
spirit
as
if
by
the
aid
of
a
magic
mirror
goethe
sister
she
was
tall
well
and
delicately
formed
and
had
something
naturally
dignified
in
her
demeanour
which
melted
away
into
a
pleasing
mildness
the
lineaments
of
her
face
neither
striking
nor
beautiful
indicated
a
character
which
was
not
and
could
not
be
at
union
with
itself
her
eyes
were
not
the
finest
i
have
ever
seen
but
the
deepest
behind
which
you
expected
the
most
and
when
they
expressed
any
affection
any
love
their
brilliancy
was
unequalled
and
yet
properly
speaking
this
expression
was
not
tender
like
that
which
comes
from
the
heart
and
at
the
same
time
carries
with
it
something
of
longing
and
desire
this
expression
came
from
the
soul
it
was
full
and
rich
it
seemed
as
if
it
would
only
give
without
needing
to
receive
but
what
in
a
manner
quite
peculiar
disfigured
her
face
so
that
she
would
often
appear
positively
ugly
was
the
fashion
of
those
times
which
not
only
bared
the
forehead
but
either
accidentally
or
on
purpose
did
everything
apparently
or
really
to
enlarge
it
now
as
she
had
the
most
feminine
most
neatly
arched
forehead
and
moreover
a
pair
of
strong
black
eyebrows
and
prominent
eyes
these
circumstances
occasioned
a
contrast
which
if
it
did
not
repel
every
stranger
at
the
first
glance
at
least
did
not
attract
him
she
early
felt
it
and
this
feeling
became
constantly
the
more
painful
to
her
the
further
she
advanced
into
the
years
when
both
sexes
find
an
innocent
pleasure
in
being
mutually
agreeable
to
nobody
can
his
own
form
be
repugnant
the
ugliest
as
well
as
the
most
beautiful
has
a
right
to
enjoy
his
own
presence
and
as
favour
beautifies
and
every
one
regards
himself
in
the
with
favour
it
may
be
asserted
that
every
one
must
see
himself
with
complacency
even
if
he
would
struggle
against
the
feeling
yet
my
sister
had
such
a
decided
foundation
of
good
sense
that
she
could
not
possibly
be
blind
and
silly
in
this
respect
on
the
contrary
she
perhaps
knew
more
clearly
than
she
ought
that
she
stood
far
behind
her
female
playfellows
in
external
beauty
without
feeling
consoled
by
the
fact
that
she
infinitely
surpassed
them
in
internal
advantages
if
a
lady
can
be
recompensed
for
the
want
of
beauty
then
was
she
richly
so
by
the
unbounded
confidence
the
regard
and
love
which
all
her
female
friends
bore
to
her
whether
they
were
older
or
younger
all
cherished
the
same
sentiments
a
very
pleasant
society
had
collected
around
her
young
men
were
not
wanting
who
knew
how
to
insinuate
themselves
nearly
every
girl
found
an
admirer
she
alone
had
remained
without
a
partner
indeed
if
her
exterior
was
in
some
measure
repulsive
the
mind
that
gleamed
through
it
was
also
rather
repelling
than
attractive
for
the
presence
of
any
excellence
throws
others
back
upon
themselves
she
felt
this
sensibly
she
did
not
conceal
it
from
me
and
her
love
was
directed
to
me
with
so
much
the
greater
force
the
ease
was
singular
enough
as
confidants
to
whom
one
reveals
a
actually
by
genuine
sympathy
become
lovers
also
nay
grow
into
rivals
and
at
last
perchance
transfer
the
passion
to
themselves
so
it
was
with
us
two
for
when
my
connexion
with
gretchen
was
torn
asunder
my
sister
consoled
me
the
more
earnestly
because
she
secretly
felt
the
satisfaction
of
having
gotten
rid
of
a
rival
and
i
too
could
not
but
feel
a
quiet
pleasure
when
she
did
me
the
justice
to
assure
me
that
i
was
the
only
one
who
truly
loved
understood
and
esteemed
her
if
now
from
time
to
time
my
grief
for
the
loss
of
gretchen
revived
and
i
suddenly
began
to
weep
to
lament
and
to
act
in
a
disorderly
manner
my
despair
for
my
lost
one
awakened
in
her
likewise
a
similar
despairing
impatience
as
to
the
the
failures
and
miscarriages
of
such
youthful
attachments
that
we
both
thought
ourselves
infinitely
unhappy
and
the
more
so
as
in
this
singular
case
the
confidants
could
not
change
themselves
into
lovers
the
sister
lover
fortunately
however
the
capricious
god
of
love
who
needlessly
does
so
much
mischief
here
for
once
interfered
beneficially
to
extricate
us
out
of
all
perplexity
i
had
much
intercourse
with
a
young
englishman
who
was
educated
in
pfeil
he
could
give
a
good
account
of
his
own
language
i
practised
it
with
him
and
thus
learned
much
concerning
his
country
and
people
he
went
in
and
out
of
our
house
long
enough
without
my
remarking
in
him
a
liking
for
my
sister
yet
he
may
have
been
nourishing
it
in
secret
even
to
passion
for
at
last
it
declared
itself
unexpectedly
and
at
once
she
knew
him
she
esteemed
him
and
he
deserved
it
she
had
often
made
the
third
at
our
english
conversations
we
had
both
tried
to
catch
from
his
mouth
the
irregularities
of
the
english
pronunciation
and
thereby
accustomed
ourselves
not
only
to
the
peculiarities
of
its
accent
and
sound
but
even
to
what
was
most
peculiar
in
the
personal
qualities
of
our
teacher
so
that
at
last
it
sounded
strangely
enough
when
we
all
seemed
to
speak
as
if
out
of
one
mouth
the
pains
he
took
to
learn
as
much
german
from
us
in
the
like
manner
were
to
no
purpose
and
i
think
i
have
remarked
that
even
this
little
also
both
in
speaking
and
writing
was
carried
on
in
the
english
language
both
the
young
persons
were
very
well
suited
to
each
other
he
was
tall
and
as
she
was
only
still
more
slender
his
face
small
and
compact
might
really
have
been
pretty
had
it
not
been
too
much
disfigured
by
the
his
manner
was
calm
precise
one
might
often
have
called
it
dry
and
cold
but
his
heart
was
full
of
kindness
and
love
his
soul
full
of
generosity
and
his
attachments
as
lasting
as
they
were
decided
and
controlled
now
this
serious
pair
who
had
but
lately
formed
an
attachment
were
quite
peculiarly
distinguished
among
the
others
who
being
already
better
acquainted
with
each
other
of
more
frivolous
character
and
careless
as
to
the
future
roved
about
with
levity
in
these
connexions
which
commonly
pass
away
as
the
mere
fruitless
prelude
to
subsequent
and
more
serious
ties
and
very
seldom
produce
a
lasting
effect
upon
life
the
fine
weather
and
the
beautiful
country
did
not
remain
unenjoyed
by
so
lively
a
company
water
excursions
were
frequently
arranged
because
these
are
the
most
sociable
of
all
parties
of
pleasure
yet
whether
we
were
moving
on
water
or
on
land
the
individual
attracting
powers
immediately
showed
themselves
each
couple
kept
together
and
for
some
men
who
were
not
engaged
of
whom
i
was
one
there
remained
either
no
conversation
with
the
ladies
at
all
or
only
such
as
no
one
would
have
chosen
for
a
day
of
pleasure
a
friend
who
found
himself
in
this
situation
and
who
might
have
been
in
want
of
a
partner
chiefly
for
this
reason
that
with
the
best
humour
he
lacked
tenderness
and
with
much
intelligence
that
delicate
attention
without
which
connexions
of
this
kind
are
not
to
be
thought
of
this
man
after
often
humorously
and
wittily
lamenting
his
condition
promised
at
the
next
meeting
to
make
a
proposal
which
would
benefit
himself
and
the
whole
company
nor
did
he
fail
to
perform
his
promise
for
when
after
a
brilliant
trip
by
water
and
a
very
pleasant
walk
reclining
on
the
grass
between
shady
knolls
or
sitting
on
mossy
rocks
and
roots
of
trees
we
had
cheerfully
and
happily
consumed
a
rural
meal
and
our
friend
saw
us
all
cheerful
and
in
good
spirits
he
with
a
waggish
dignity
commanded
us
to
sit
close
round
him
in
a
semicircle
before
which
he
stepped
and
began
to
make
an
emphatic
peroration
as
follows
most
worthy
friends
of
both
sexes
paired
and
unpaired
it
was
already
evident
from
this
address
how
necessary
it
was
that
a
preacher
of
repentance
should
arise
and
sharpen
the
conscience
of
the
company
one
part
of
my
noble
friends
is
paired
and
they
may
find
themselves
quite
happy
another
unpaired
and
these
find
themselves
in
the
highest
degree
miserable
as
i
can
assure
you
from
my
own
experience
and
although
the
loving
couples
are
here
in
the
majority
yet
i
would
have
them
consider
whether
it
is
not
a
social
duty
to
take
thought
for
the
whole
why
do
so
many
of
us
unite
together
but
to
take
a
mutual
interest
in
each
other
and
how
can
that
be
done
when
so
many
little
secessions
are
to
be
seen
in
our
circle
far
be
it
from
me
to
insinuate
any
thing
against
such
sweet
connexions
or
even
to
wish
to
disturb
them
but
is
a
time
for
all
things
an
excellent
great
saying
of
which
indeed
nobody
thinks
when
his
own
amusement
is
sufficiently
provided
for
he
then
went
on
with
constantly
increasing
liveliness
and
gaiety
to
compare
the
social
virtues
with
the
tender
sentiments
the
latter
said
he
can
never
fail
us
we
always
carry
them
about
with
us
and
every
one
becomes
a
master
in
them
without
practice
but
we
must
go
in
quest
of
the
former
we
must
take
some
trouble
about
them
and
though
we
progress
in
them
as
much
as
we
will
we
have
never
done
learning
them
now
he
went
into
particulars
many
felt
themselves
hit
off
and
they
could
not
help
casting
glances
at
each
other
yet
our
friend
had
this
privilege
that
nothing
he
did
was
taken
ill
and
so
he
could
proceed
without
interruption
humorous
oration
it
is
not
enough
to
discover
deficiencies
indeed
it
is
unjust
to
do
so
if
at
the
same
time
one
can
not
contrive
to
give
the
means
for
bettering
the
state
of
affairs
i
will
not
therefore
my
friends
something
like
a
preacher
in
exhort
you
in
general
terms
to
repentance
and
amendment
i
rather
wish
all
amiable
couples
the
longest
and
most
enduring
happiness
and
to
contribute
to
it
myself
in
the
surest
manner
i
propose
to
sever
and
abolish
these
most
charming
little
segregations
during
our
social
hours
i
have
he
continued
already
provided
for
the
execution
of
my
project
if
it
should
meet
your
approbation
here
is
a
bag
in
which
are
the
names
of
the
gentlemen
now
draw
my
fair
ones
and
be
pleased
to
favour
as
your
servant
for
a
week
him
whom
fate
shall
send
you
this
is
binding
only
within
our
circle
as
soon
as
that
is
broken
up
these
connexions
are
also
abolished
and
the
heart
may
decide
who
shall
attend
you
home
a
large
part
of
the
company
had
been
delighted
with
this
address
and
the
manner
in
which
he
delivered
it
and
seemed
to
approve
of
the
notion
yet
some
couples
looked
at
each
other
as
if
they
thought
that
it
would
not
answer
their
purpose
he
therefore
cried
with
humorous
vehemence
truly
it
surprises
me
that
some
one
does
not
spring
up
and
though
others
hesitate
extol
my
plan
explain
its
advantages
and
spare
me
the
pain
of
being
my
own
encomiast
i
am
the
oldest
among
you
may
god
forgive
me
for
that
already
have
i
a
bald
pate
which
is
owing
to
my
great
meditation
here
he
took
off
his
hat
but
i
would
expose
it
to
view
with
joy
and
honour
if
my
lucubrations
which
dry
up
my
skin
and
rob
me
of
my
finest
adornment
could
only
be
in
some
measure
beneficial
to
myself
and
others
we
are
young
my
friends
that
is
good
we
shall
grow
older
that
is
bad
we
take
little
offence
at
each
other
that
is
right
and
in
accordance
with
the
season
but
soon
my
friends
the
days
will
come
when
we
shall
have
much
to
be
displeased
at
in
ourselves
then
let
every
one
see
that
he
makes
all
right
with
himself
but
at
the
same
time
others
will
take
things
ill
of
us
and
on
what
account
we
shall
not
understand
for
this
we
must
prepare
ourselves
this
shall
now
be
done
he
had
delivered
the
whole
speech
but
especially
the
last
part
with
the
tone
and
gesture
of
a
capuchin
for
as
he
was
a
catholic
he
might
have
had
abundant
opportunity
to
study
the
oratory
of
these
fathers
he
now
appeared
out
of
breath
wiped
his
youthful
bald
head
which
really
gave
him
the
look
of
a
priest
and
by
these
drolleries
put
the
company
in
such
good
humour
that
every
one
was
eager
to
hear
him
longer
but
instead
of
proceeding
he
drew
open
the
bag
and
turned
to
the
nearest
lady
now
for
a
trial
of
it
exclaimed
he
the
work
will
do
credit
to
the
master
if
in
a
week
time
we
do
not
like
it
we
will
give
it
up
and
stick
to
the
old
plan
half
willingly
half
on
compulsion
the
ladies
drew
their
tickets
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
various
passions
were
in
play
during
this
little
affair
fortunately
it
happened
that
the
were
separated
while
the
more
serious
remained
together
and
so
too
my
sister
kept
her
englishman
which
on
both
sides
they
took
very
kindly
of
the
god
of
love
and
luck
the
new
were
immediately
united
by
the
their
healths
were
drank
and
to
all
the
more
joy
was
wished
as
its
duration
was
to
be
but
short
this
was
certainly
the
merriest
moment
that
our
company
had
enjoyed
for
a
long
time
the
young
men
to
whose
share
no
lady
had
fallen
held
for
this
week
the
office
of
providing
for
the
mind
the
soul
and
the
body
as
our
orator
expressed
himself
but
especially
he
hinted
for
the
soul
since
both
the
others
already
knew
how
to
help
themselves
these
masters
of
ceremonies
who
wished
at
once
to
do
themselves
credit
brought
into
play
some
very
pretty
new
games
prepared
at
some
distance
a
supper
which
we
had
not
reckoned
on
and
illuminated
the
yacht
on
our
return
at
night
although
there
was
no
necessity
for
it
in
the
bright
moonlight
but
they
excused
themselves
by
saying
that
it
was
quite
conformable
to
the
new
social
regulation
to
outshine
the
tender
glances
of
the
heavenly
moon
by
earthly
candles
the
moment
we
touched
the
shore
our
solon
cried
missa
est
each
one
now
handed
out
of
the
vessel
the
lady
who
had
fallen
to
him
by
lot
and
then
surrendered
her
to
her
proper
partner
on
receiving
his
own
in
exchange
at
our
next
meeting
this
weekly
regulation
was
established
for
the
summer
and
the
lots
were
drawn
once
more
there
was
no
question
but
that
this
pleasantry
gave
a
new
and
unexpected
turn
to
the
company
and
every
one
was
stimulated
to
display
whatever
of
wit
and
grace
was
in
him
and
to
pay
court
to
his
temporary
fair
one
in
the
most
obliging
manner
since
he
might
depend
on
having
a
sufficient
store
of
complaisance
for
one
week
at
least
second
oration
we
had
scarcely
settled
ourselves
than
instead
of
thanking
our
orator
we
reproached
him
for
having
kept
to
himself
the
best
part
of
his
speech
the
conclusion
he
thereupon
protested
that
the
best
part
of
a
speech
was
persuasion
and
that
he
who
did
not
aim
at
persuasion
should
make
no
speech
for
as
to
conviction
that
was
a
ticklish
business
as
however
they
gave
him
no
peace
he
began
a
capuchinade
on
the
spot
more
comical
than
ever
perhaps
for
the
very
reason
that
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
speak
on
the
most
serious
subjects
for
with
texts
out
of
the
bible
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
business
with
similes
which
did
not
fit
with
allusions
which
illustrated
nothing
he
carried
out
the
proposition
that
whosoever
does
not
know
how
to
conceal
his
passions
inclinations
wishes
purposes
and
plans
will
come
to
no
good
in
the
world
but
will
be
disturbed
and
made
a
butt
in
every
end
and
corner
and
that
especially
if
one
would
be
happy
in
love
one
must
take
pains
to
keep
it
a
most
profound
secret
this
thought
ran
through
the
whole
without
properly
speaking
a
single
word
of
it
being
said
if
you
would
form
a
conception
of
this
singular
man
let
it
be
considered
that
being
born
with
a
good
foundation
he
had
cultivated
his
talents
and
especially
his
acuteness
in
jesuit
schools
and
had
amassed
an
extensive
knowledge
of
the
world
and
of
men
but
only
on
the
bad
side
he
was
some
years
old
and
would
gladly
have
made
me
a
proselyte
to
his
contempt
for
mankind
but
this
would
not
take
with
me
as
i
always
had
a
great
desire
to
be
good
myself
and
to
find
good
in
others
meanwhile
i
was
by
him
made
attentive
to
many
things
to
complete
the
of
every
merry
company
an
actor
is
necessary
who
feels
pleasure
when
the
others
to
enliven
many
an
indifferent
moment
point
the
arrows
of
their
wit
at
him
if
he
is
not
merely
a
stuffed
saracen
like
those
on
whom
the
knights
used
to
practise
their
lances
in
mock
battles
but
understands
himself
how
to
skirmish
to
rally
and
to
challenge
how
to
wound
lightly
and
recover
himself
again
and
while
he
seems
to
expose
himself
to
give
others
a
thrust
home
nothing
more
agreeable
can
be
found
such
a
man
we
possessed
in
our
friend
horn
whose
name
to
begin
with
gave
occasion
for
all
sorts
of
jokes
and
who
on
account
of
his
small
figure
was
called
nothing
but
hörnchen
little
horn
he
was
in
fact
the
smallest
in
the
company
of
a
stout
but
pleasing
form
a
a
mouth
somewhat
pouting
little
sparkling
eyes
made
up
a
swarthy
countenance
which
always
seemed
to
invite
laughter
his
little
compact
skull
was
thickly
covered
with
curly
black
hair
his
beard
was
prematurely
blue
and
he
would
have
liked
to
let
it
grow
that
as
a
comic
mask
he
might
always
keep
the
company
laughing
for
the
rest
he
was
neat
and
nimble
but
insisted
that
he
had
bandy
legs
which
everybody
granted
since
he
was
bent
on
having
it
so
but
about
which
many
a
joke
arose
for
since
he
was
in
request
as
a
very
good
dancer
he
reckoned
it
among
the
peculiarities
of
the
fair
sex
that
they
always
liked
to
see
bandy
legs
on
the
floor
his
cheerfulness
was
indestructible
and
his
presence
at
every
meeting
indispensable
we
two
kept
more
together
because
he
was
to
follow
me
to
the
university
and
he
well
deserves
that
i
should
mention
him
with
all
honour
as
he
adhered
to
me
for
many
years
with
infinite
love
faithfulness
and
patience
by
my
ease
in
rhyming
and
in
winning
from
common
objects
a
poetical
side
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
seduced
into
similar
labours
our
little
social
excursions
parties
of
pleasure
and
the
contingencies
that
occurred
in
them
we
decked
out
poetically
and
thus
by
the
description
of
an
event
a
new
event
always
arose
but
as
such
social
jests
commonly
degenerate
into
personal
ridicule
and
my
friend
horn
with
his
burlesque
representations
did
not
always
keep
within
proper
bounds
many
a
misunderstanding
arose
which
however
could
soon
be
softened
down
and
effaced
thus
also
he
tried
his
skill
in
a
species
of
poetry
which
was
then
very
much
the
order
of
the
day
the
comic
heroical
poem
pope
of
the
had
called
forth
many
imitations
zachariä
cultivated
this
branch
of
poetry
on
german
soil
and
it
pleased
every
one
because
the
ordinary
subject
of
it
was
some
awkward
fellow
of
whom
the
genii
made
game
while
they
favoured
the
better
one
it
is
not
wonderful
but
yet
it
excites
wonder
when
in
contemplating
a
literature
especially
the
german
one
observes
how
a
whole
nation
can
not
get
free
from
a
subject
which
has
been
once
given
and
happily
treated
in
a
certain
form
but
will
have
it
repeated
in
every
manner
until
at
last
the
original
itself
is
covered
up
and
stifled
by
the
heaps
of
imitations
comic
heroical
poetry
the
heroic
poem
of
my
friend
was
a
voucher
for
this
remark
at
a
great
sledging
party
an
awkward
man
has
assigned
to
him
a
lady
who
does
not
like
him
comically
enough
there
befalls
him
one
after
another
every
accident
that
can
happen
on
such
an
occasion
until
at
last
as
he
is
entreating
for
the
right
a
kiss
he
falls
from
the
back
seat
for
just
then
as
was
natural
the
fates
tripped
him
up
the
fair
one
seizes
the
reins
and
drives
home
alone
where
a
favoured
friend
receives
her
and
triumphs
over
his
presumptuous
rival
as
to
the
rest
it
was
very
prettily
contrived
that
the
four
different
kinds
of
spirits
should
worry
him
in
turn
till
at
the
end
the
gnomes
hoist
him
completely
out
of
the
saddle
the
poem
written
in
alexandrines
and
founded
on
a
true
story
highly
delighted
our
little
public
and
we
were
convinced
that
it
could
well
be
compared
with
the
of
löwen
or
the
of
zachariä
while
now
our
social
pleasures
required
but
an
evening
and
the
preparations
for
them
only
a
few
hours
i
had
enough
time
to
read
and
as
i
thought
to
study
to
please
my
father
i
diligently
repeated
the
smaller
work
of
hopp
and
could
stand
an
examination
in
it
forwards
and
backwards
by
which
means
i
made
myself
complete
master
of
the
chief
contents
of
the
institutes
but
a
restless
eagerness
for
knowledge
urged
me
further
i
lit
upon
the
history
of
ancient
literature
and
from
that
fell
into
an
encyclopedism
in
which
i
read
through
and
morhov
and
thus
gained
a
general
notion
of
how
many
strange
things
might
have
happened
in
learning
and
life
by
this
persevering
and
rapid
industry
continued
day
and
night
i
more
confused
than
instructed
myself
but
i
lost
myself
in
a
still
greater
labyrinth
when
i
found
bayle
in
my
father
library
and
plunged
deep
into
him
but
a
leading
conviction
which
was
continually
revived
within
me
was
that
of
the
importance
of
the
ancient
tongues
since
from
amidst
this
literary
thus
much
continually
forced
itself
upon
me
that
in
them
were
preserved
all
the
models
of
oratory
and
at
the
same
time
everything
else
of
worth
that
the
world
has
ever
possessed
hebrew
together
with
biblical
studies
had
retired
into
the
background
and
greek
likewise
since
my
acquaintance
with
it
did
not
extend
beyond
the
new
testament
i
therefore
the
more
zealously
kept
to
latin
the
in
which
lie
nearer
to
us
and
which
besides
its
splendid
original
productions
offers
us
the
other
wealth
of
all
ages
in
translations
and
the
works
of
the
greatest
scholars
i
consequently
read
much
in
this
language
with
great
ease
and
was
bold
enough
to
believe
i
understood
the
authors
because
i
missed
nothing
of
the
literal
sense
indeed
i
was
very
indignant
when
i
heard
that
grotius
had
insolently
declared
he
did
not
read
terence
as
boys
do
happy
of
youth
nay
of
men
in
general
that
they
can
at
every
moment
of
their
existence
fancy
themselves
finished
and
inquire
after
neither
the
true
nor
the
false
after
neither
the
high
nor
the
deep
but
merely
after
that
which
is
suited
to
them
i
had
thus
learned
latin
like
german
french
and
english
merely
by
practice
without
rules
and
without
conception
whoever
knows
the
condition
of
school
instruction
then
will
not
think
it
strange
that
i
skipped
grammar
as
well
as
rhetoric
all
seemed
to
me
to
come
together
naturally
i
retained
the
words
their
forms
and
inflexions
in
my
ear
and
mind
and
used
the
language
with
case
in
writing
and
in
chattering
disgust
at
frankfort
michaelmas
the
time
when
i
was
to
go
to
the
university
was
approaching
and
my
mind
was
excited
quite
as
much
about
my
life
as
about
my
learning
i
grew
more
and
more
clearly
conscious
of
an
aversion
to
my
native
city
by
gretchen
removal
the
heart
had
been
broken
out
of
the
boyish
and
youthful
plant
it
needed
time
to
bud
forth
again
from
its
sides
and
surmount
the
first
injury
by
a
new
growth
my
ramblings
through
the
streets
had
ceased
i
now
like
others
only
went
such
ways
as
were
necessary
i
never
went
again
into
gretchen
quarter
of
the
city
not
even
into
its
vicinity
and
as
my
old
walls
and
towers
became
gradually
disagreeable
to
me
so
also
was
i
displeased
at
the
constitution
of
the
city
all
that
hitherto
seemed
so
worthy
of
honour
now
appeared
to
me
in
distorted
shapes
as
grandson
of
the
schultheiss
the
secret
defects
of
such
a
republic
had
not
remained
unknown
to
me
the
less
so
as
children
feel
quite
a
peculiar
surprise
and
are
excited
to
busy
researches
as
soon
as
something
which
they
have
hitherto
implicitly
revered
becomes
in
any
degree
suspicious
to
them
the
fruitless
indignation
of
upright
men
in
opposition
to
those
who
are
to
be
gained
and
even
bribed
by
factions
had
become
but
too
plain
to
me
i
hated
every
injustice
beyond
measure
for
children
are
all
moral
rigorists
my
father
who
was
concerned
in
the
affairs
of
the
city
only
as
a
private
citizen
expressed
himself
with
very
lively
indignation
about
much
that
had
failed
and
did
i
not
see
him
after
so
many
studies
endeavours
pains
travels
and
so
much
varied
cultivation
between
his
four
walls
leading
a
solitary
life
such
as
i
could
never
desire
for
myself
all
this
put
together
lay
as
a
horrible
load
on
my
mind
from
which
i
could
only
free
myself
by
trying
to
contrive
a
plan
of
life
altogether
different
from
that
which
had
been
marked
out
for
me
in
thought
i
threw
away
my
legal
studies
and
devoted
myself
solely
to
the
languages
to
antiquities
to
history
and
to
all
that
flows
from
them
indeed
at
all
times
the
poetic
imitation
of
what
i
had
perceived
in
myself
in
others
and
in
nature
afforded
me
the
greatest
pleasure
i
did
it
with
facility
because
it
came
by
instinct
and
no
criticism
had
led
me
astray
and
if
i
did
not
feel
full
confidence
in
my
productions
i
could
certainly
regard
them
as
defective
but
not
such
as
to
be
utterly
rejected
was
this
or
that
censured
in
them
i
still
retained
in
private
my
conviction
that
i
could
not
but
gradually
improve
and
that
some
time
i
might
be
honourably
named
along
with
hagedorn
gellert
and
other
such
men
but
such
a
distinction
alone
seemed
to
me
too
empty
and
inadequate
i
wished
to
devote
myself
professionally
and
with
zeal
to
those
aforesaid
fundamental
studies
and
while
i
thought
to
advance
myself
more
rapidly
in
my
own
works
by
a
more
thorough
insight
into
antiquity
to
qualify
myself
for
a
university
professorship
which
seemed
to
me
the
most
desirable
thing
for
a
young
man
who
intended
to
cultivate
himself
and
to
contribute
to
the
cultivation
of
others
with
these
intentions
i
always
had
my
eye
upon
göttingen
my
whole
confidence
rested
upon
men
like
heyne
michaelis
and
so
many
others
my
most
ardent
wish
was
to
sit
at
their
feet
and
attend
to
their
instructions
but
my
father
remained
inflexible
howsoever
some
family
friends
who
were
of
my
opinion
tried
to
influence
him
he
persisted
that
i
must
go
to
leipzig
i
was
now
resolved
contrary
to
his
views
and
wishes
to
choose
a
line
of
studies
and
of
life
for
myself
by
way
of
the
obstinacy
of
my
father
who
without
knowing
it
opposed
himself
to
my
plans
strengthened
me
in
my
impiety
so
that
i
made
no
scruple
to
listen
to
him
by
the
hour
while
he
described
and
repeated
to
me
the
course
of
study
and
of
life
which
i
should
pursue
at
the
universities
and
in
the
world
since
all
hopes
of
göttingen
were
cut
off
i
now
turned
my
eyes
towards
leipzig
there
ernesti
appeared
to
me
as
a
brilliant
light
morus
too
already
awakened
much
i
planned
for
myself
in
secret
an
or
rather
i
built
a
castle
in
the
air
on
a
tolerably
solid
foundation
and
it
seemed
to
me
quite
romantically
honourable
to
mark
out
my
own
path
of
life
which
appeared
the
less
visionary
as
griesbach
had
already
made
great
progress
in
a
similar
way
and
was
commended
for
it
by
every
one
the
secret
joy
of
a
prisoner
when
he
has
unbound
the
fetters
and
rapidly
filed
through
the
bars
of
his
can
not
be
greater
than
was
mine
as
i
saw
day
after
day
disappear
and
october
draw
nigh
the
inclement
season
and
the
bad
roads
of
which
everybody
had
something
to
tell
did
not
frighten
me
the
thought
of
making
good
my
footing
in
a
strange
place
and
in
winter
did
not
make
me
sad
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
only
saw
my
present
situation
was
gloomy
and
represented
to
myself
the
other
unknown
world
as
light
and
cheerful
thus
i
formed
my
dreams
to
which
i
gave
myself
up
exclusively
and
promised
myself
nothing
but
happiness
and
content
in
the
distance
closely
as
i
kept
these
projects
a
secret
from
every
one
else
i
could
not
hide
them
from
my
sister
who
after
being
very
much
alarmed
about
them
at
first
was
finally
consoled
when
i
promised
to
send
after
her
so
that
she
could
enjoy
with
me
the
brilliant
station
i
was
to
obtain
and
share
my
comfort
with
me
michaelmas
so
longingly
expected
came
at
last
when
i
set
out
with
delight
in
company
with
the
bookseller
fleischer
and
his
wife
whose
maiden
name
was
triller
and
who
was
going
to
visit
her
father
in
wittemberg
and
i
left
behind
me
the
worthy
city
in
which
i
had
been
born
and
bred
with
indifference
as
if
i
wished
never
to
set
foot
in
it
again
thus
at
certain
epochs
children
part
from
parents
servants
from
masters
from
their
patrons
and
whether
it
succeed
or
not
such
an
attempt
to
stand
on
one
own
feet
to
make
one
self
independent
to
live
for
one
self
is
always
in
accordance
with
the
will
of
nature
departure
for
leipzig
we
had
driven
out
through
the
allerheiligen
gate
and
had
soon
left
hanau
behind
us
after
which
we
reached
scenes
which
aroused
my
attention
by
their
novelty
if
at
this
season
of
the
year
they
offered
little
that
was
pleasing
a
continual
rain
had
completely
spoiled
the
roads
which
generally
speaking
were
not
then
in
such
good
order
as
we
find
them
now
and
our
journey
was
thus
neither
pleasant
nor
happy
yet
i
was
indebted
to
this
damp
weather
for
the
sight
of
a
natural
phenomenon
which
must
be
exceedingly
rare
for
i
have
seen
nothing
like
it
since
nor
have
i
heard
of
its
being
observed
by
others
at
night
namely
we
were
driving
up
a
rising
ground
between
hanau
and
gelhausen
and
although
it
was
dark
we
preferred
walking
to
exposing
ourselves
to
the
danger
and
difficulty
of
that
part
of
the
road
all
at
once
in
a
ravine
on
the
side
of
the
way
i
saw
a
sort
of
amphitheatre
wonderfully
illuminated
in
a
space
there
were
innumerable
little
lights
gleaming
ranged
over
one
another
and
they
shone
so
brilliantly
that
the
eye
was
dazzled
but
what
stiff
more
confused
the
sight
was
that
they
did
not
keep
still
but
jumped
about
here
and
there
as
well
downwards
from
above
as
and
in
every
direction
the
most
of
them
however
remained
stationary
and
beamed
on
it
was
only
with
the
greatest
reluctance
that
i
suffered
myself
to
be
called
away
from
this
spectacle
which
i
could
have
wished
to
examine
more
closely
on
interrogating
the
postillion
he
indeed
knew
nothing
about
such
a
phenomenon
but
said
that
there
was
in
the
neighbourhood
an
old
the
excavation
of
which
was
filled
with
water
now
whether
this
was
a
pandemonium
of
or
a
company
of
shining
creatures
i
will
not
decide
the
roads
through
thuringia
were
yet
worse
and
unfortunately
at
our
coach
stuck
fast
in
the
vicinity
of
auerstädt
we
were
far
removed
from
all
mankind
and
did
everything
possible
to
work
ourselves
out
i
failed
not
to
exert
myself
zealously
and
might
thereby
have
overstrained
the
ligaments
of
my
chest
for
soon
afterwards
i
felt
a
pain
which
went
off
and
returned
and
did
not
leave
me
entirely
until
after
many
years
yet
on
that
same
night
as
if
it
had
been
destined
for
alternate
good
and
bad
luck
i
was
forced
after
an
unexpectedly
fortunate
incident
to
experience
a
teazing
vexation
we
met
in
auerstädt
a
genteel
married
couple
who
had
also
just
arrived
having
been
delayed
by
a
similar
accident
a
pleasing
dignified
man
in
his
best
years
with
a
very
handsome
wife
they
politely
persuaded
us
to
sup
in
their
company
and
i
felt
very
happy
when
the
excellent
lady
addressed
a
friendly
word
to
me
but
when
i
was
sent
out
to
accelerate
the
soup
which
had
been
ordered
not
having
been
accustomed
to
the
loss
of
rest
and
the
fatigues
of
travelling
such
an
unconquerable
drowsiness
overtook
me
that
actually
i
fell
asleep
while
walking
returned
into
the
room
with
my
hat
on
my
head
and
without
remarking
that
the
others
were
saying
grace
placed
myself
with
quiet
unconsciousness
behind
the
chair
and
never
dreamed
that
by
my
conduct
i
had
come
to
disturb
their
devotions
in
a
very
droll
way
madame
fleischer
who
lacked
neither
spirit
nor
wit
nor
tongue
entreated
the
strangers
before
they
had
seated
themselves
not
to
be
surprised
at
anything
they
might
see
here
for
that
their
young
had
in
his
nature
much
of
the
peculiarity
of
the
quakers
who
believe
that
they
can
not
honour
god
and
the
king
better
than
with
covered
heads
the
handsome
lady
who
could
not
restrain
her
laughter
looked
prettier
than
ever
in
consequence
and
i
would
have
given
everything
in
the
world
not
to
have
been
the
cause
of
a
merriment
which
was
so
beautifully
becoming
in
her
countenance
i
had
however
scarcely
laid
aside
my
hat
than
these
persons
in
accordance
with
their
polished
manners
immediately
dropped
the
joke
and
with
the
best
wine
from
their
completely
extinguished
sleep
chagrin
and
the
memory
of
all
past
troubles
leipzig
i
arrived
in
leipzig
just
at
the
time
of
the
fair
from
which
i
derived
particular
pleasure
for
here
i
saw
before
me
the
continuation
of
a
state
of
things
belonging
to
my
native
city
familiar
wares
and
traders
only
in
other
places
and
in
a
different
order
i
rambled
about
the
market
and
the
booths
with
much
interest
but
my
attention
was
particularly
attracted
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
eastern
countries
in
their
strange
dresses
the
poles
and
russians
and
above
all
the
greeks
for
the
sake
of
whose
handsome
forms
and
dignified
costume
i
often
went
to
the
spot
but
this
animating
bustle
was
soon
over
and
now
the
city
itself
appeared
before
me
with
its
handsome
high
and
uniform
houses
it
made
a
very
good
impression
upon
me
and
it
can
not
be
denied
that
in
general
but
especially
in
the
silent
moments
of
sundays
and
holidays
it
has
something
imposing
and
when
in
the
moonlight
the
streets
were
half
in
shadow
they
often
invited
me
to
nocturnal
promenades
in
the
meantime
as
compared
with
that
to
which
i
had
hitherto
been
accustomed
this
new
state
of
affairs
was
by
no
means
satisfactory
leipzig
calls
up
before
the
spectator
no
antique
time
it
is
a
new
recently
elapsed
epoch
testifying
commercial
activity
comfort
and
wealth
which
announces
itself
to
us
in
these
monuments
yet
quite
to
my
taste
were
the
buildings
which
fronting
two
streets
and
embracing
a
within
their
large
built
round
with
lofty
walls
are
like
large
castles
nay
even
in
one
of
these
strange
places
i
quartered
myself
namely
in
the
bombshell
tavern
between
the
old
and
the
new
newmarket
a
couple
of
pleasant
rooms
looking
out
upon
a
which
on
account
of
the
thoroughfare
was
not
without
animation
were
occupied
by
the
bookseller
fleischer
during
the
fair
and
by
me
taken
for
the
rest
of
the
time
at
a
moderate
price
as
a
i
found
a
theological
student
who
was
deeply
learned
in
his
professional
studies
a
sound
thinker
but
poor
and
suffering
much
from
his
eyes
which
caused
him
great
anxiety
for
the
future
he
had
brought
this
affliction
upon
himself
by
his
inordinate
reading
till
the
latest
dusk
of
the
evening
and
even
by
moonlight
to
save
a
little
oil
our
old
hostess
showed
herself
benevolent
to
him
always
friendly
to
me
and
careful
for
us
both
gellert
i
now
my
letters
of
introduction
to
hofrath
böhme
who
once
a
pupil
of
maskow
and
now
his
successor
was
professor
of
history
and
public
law
a
little
lively
man
received
me
kindly
enough
and
introduced
me
to
his
wife
both
of
them
as
well
as
the
other
persons
whom
i
waited
on
gave
me
the
pleasantest
hopes
as
to
my
future
residence
but
at
first
i
let
no
one
know
of
the
design
i
entertained
although
i
could
scarcely
wait
for
the
favourable
moment
when
i
should
declare
myself
free
from
jurisprudence
and
devoted
to
the
study
of
the
classics
i
cautiously
waited
till
the
fleischers
had
returned
that
my
purpose
might
not
be
too
prematurely
betrayed
to
my
family
but
i
then
went
without
delay
to
hofrath
böhme
to
whom
before
all
i
thought
i
must
confide
the
matter
and
with
much
and
boldness
of
speech
disclosed
my
views
to
him
however
i
found
by
no
means
a
good
reception
of
my
proposition
as
professor
of
history
and
public
law
he
had
a
declared
hatred
for
everything
that
savoured
of
the
unfortunately
he
did
not
stand
on
the
best
footing
with
those
who
cultivated
them
and
gellert
in
particular
in
whom
i
had
awkwardly
enough
expressed
much
confidence
he
could
not
even
endure
to
send
a
faithful
student
to
those
men
therefore
while
he
deprived
himself
of
one
and
especially
under
such
circumstances
seemed
to
him
altogether
out
of
the
question
he
therefore
gave
me
a
severe
lecture
on
the
spot
in
which
he
protested
that
he
could
not
permit
such
a
step
without
the
permission
of
my
parents
even
if
he
approved
of
it
himself
which
was
not
the
case
in
this
instance
he
then
passionately
inveighed
against
philology
and
the
study
of
languages
but
still
more
against
poetical
exercises
which
i
had
indeed
allowed
to
peep
out
in
the
he
finally
concluded
that
if
i
wished
to
enter
more
closely
into
the
study
of
the
ancients
it
could
be
done
much
better
by
the
way
of
jurisprudence
he
brought
to
my
recollection
many
elegant
jurists
such
as
eberhard
otto
and
heineccius
promised
me
mountains
of
gold
from
roman
antiquities
and
the
history
of
law
and
showed
me
clear
as
the
sun
that
i
should
here
be
taking
no
roundabout
way
even
if
afterwards
on
more
mature
deliberation
and
with
the
consent
of
my
parents
i
should
determine
to
follow
out
my
own
plan
he
begged
me
in
a
friendly
manner
to
think
the
matter
over
once
more
and
to
open
my
mind
to
him
soon
as
it
would
be
necessary
to
come
to
a
determination
at
once
on
account
of
the
impending
commencement
of
the
lectures
it
was
however
very
polite
of
him
not
to
press
me
on
the
spot
his
arguments
and
the
weight
with
which
he
advanced
them
had
already
convinced
my
pliant
youth
and
i
now
first
saw
the
difficulties
and
doubtfulness
of
a
matter
which
i
had
privately
pictured
to
myself
as
so
feasible
frau
hofrath
böhme
invited
me
to
see
her
shortly
afterwards
i
found
her
alone
she
was
no
longer
young
and
had
very
delicate
health
was
gentle
and
tender
to
an
infinite
degree
and
formed
a
decided
contrast
to
her
husband
whose
was
even
clustering
she
spoke
of
the
conversation
her
husband
had
lately
had
with
me
and
once
more
placed
the
subject
before
me
in
all
its
bearings
in
so
cordial
a
manner
so
affectionately
and
sensibly
that
i
could
not
help
yielding
the
few
reservations
on
which
i
insisted
were
also
agreed
upon
by
the
other
side
thereupon
her
husband
regulated
my
hours
for
i
was
to
hear
lectures
on
philosophy
the
history
of
law
the
institutes
and
some
other
matters
i
was
content
with
this
but
i
carried
my
point
so
as
to
attend
gellert
history
of
literature
with
stockhausen
for
a
and
his
besides
the
reverence
and
love
with
which
gellert
was
regarded
by
all
young
people
was
extraordinary
i
had
already
visited
him
and
had
been
kindly
received
by
him
not
of
tall
stature
elegant
without
being
lean
soft
and
rather
pensive
eyes
a
very
fine
forehead
a
nose
aquiline
but
not
too
much
so
a
delicate
mouth
a
face
of
an
agreeable
oval
all
made
his
presence
pleasing
and
desirable
it
cost
some
trouble
to
reach
him
his
two
appeared
like
priests
who
guard
a
sanctuary
the
access
to
which
is
not
permitted
to
everybody
nor
at
every
time
and
such
a
precaution
was
very
necessary
for
he
would
have
sacrificed
his
whole
time
had
he
been
willing
to
receive
and
satisfy
all
those
who
wished
to
become
intimate
with
him
at
first
i
attended
my
lectures
assiduously
and
faithfully
but
the
philosophy
would
not
enlighten
me
at
all
in
the
logic
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
i
had
so
to
tear
asunder
isolate
and
as
it
were
destroy
those
operations
of
the
mind
which
i
had
performed
with
the
greatest
ease
from
my
youth
upwards
and
this
in
order
to
see
into
the
right
use
of
them
of
the
thing
itself
of
the
world
and
of
god
i
thought
i
knew
about
as
much
as
the
professor
himself
and
in
more
places
than
one
the
affair
seemed
to
me
to
come
into
a
tremendous
strait
yet
all
went
on
in
tolerable
order
till
towards
shrovetide
when
in
the
neighbourhood
of
professor
winkler
house
on
the
the
most
delicious
fritters
came
hot
out
of
the
pan
just
at
the
hour
of
lecture
and
these
delayed
us
so
long
that
our
became
disordered
and
the
conclusion
of
them
towards
spring
melted
away
together
with
the
snow
and
was
lost
it
was
soon
quite
as
bad
with
the
law
lectures
for
i
already
knew
just
as
much
as
the
professor
thought
good
to
communicate
to
us
my
stubborn
industry
in
writing
down
the
lectures
at
first
was
paralyzed
by
degrees
for
i
found
it
excessively
tedious
to
pen
down
once
more
that
which
partly
by
question
partly
by
answer
i
had
repeated
with
my
father
often
enough
to
retain
it
for
ever
in
my
memory
the
harm
which
is
done
when
young
people
at
school
are
advanced
too
far
in
many
things
was
afterwards
manifested
still
more
when
time
and
attention
were
diverted
from
exercises
in
the
languages
and
a
foundation
in
what
are
properly
speaking
preparatory
studies
in
order
to
be
applied
to
what
are
called
realities
which
dissipate
more
than
they
cultivate
if
they
are
not
methodically
and
thoroughly
taught
i
here
mention
by
the
way
another
evil
by
which
students
are
much
embarrassed
professors
as
well
as
other
men
in
office
can
not
all
be
of
the
same
age
but
when
the
younger
ones
teach
in
fact
only
that
they
may
learn
and
moreover
it
they
have
talent
anticipate
their
age
they
acquire
their
own
cultivation
altogether
at
the
cost
of
their
hearers
since
these
are
not
instructed
in
what
they
really
need
but
in
that
which
the
professor
finds
it
necessary
to
elaborate
for
himself
among
the
oldest
professors
on
the
contrary
many
are
for
a
long
time
stationary
they
deliver
on
the
whole
only
fixed
views
and
in
the
details
much
that
time
has
already
condemned
as
useless
and
false
between
the
two
arises
a
sad
conflict
in
which
young
minds
are
dragged
hither
and
thither
and
which
can
scarcely
be
set
right
by
the
professors
who
though
sufficiently
instructed
and
cultivated
always
feel
within
themselves
an
active
endeavour
after
knowledge
and
reflection
now
as
in
this
way
i
learned
to
know
much
more
than
i
could
digest
whereby
a
constantly
increasing
uncomfortableness
was
forced
upon
me
so
also
from
life
i
experienced
many
disagreeable
trifles
as
indeed
one
must
always
pay
one
footing
when
one
changes
one
place
and
comes
into
a
new
position
the
first
thing
that
the
ladies
blamed
in
me
related
to
my
dress
for
i
had
come
from
home
to
the
university
rather
oddly
equipped
domestic
tailoring
my
father
who
detested
nothing
so
much
as
when
something
happened
in
vain
when
any
one
did
not
know
how
to
make
use
of
his
time
or
found
no
opportunity
for
turning
it
to
account
carried
his
economy
of
time
and
abilities
so
far
that
nothing
gave
him
greater
pleasure
than
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
he
had
therefore
never
engaged
a
servant
who
could
not
be
useful
to
the
house
in
something
else
now
as
he
had
always
written
everything
with
his
own
hand
and
had
latterly
the
convenience
of
dictating
to
the
young
inmate
of
the
house
he
found
it
most
advantageous
to
have
tailors
for
his
domestics
who
were
obliged
to
make
good
use
of
their
time
as
they
not
only
had
to
make
their
own
liveries
but
the
clothes
for
my
father
and
the
children
besides
doing
all
the
mending
my
father
himself
took
pains
to
have
the
best
cloths
and
stuffs
by
getting
fine
wares
of
the
foreign
merchants
at
the
fair
and
laying
them
up
in
store
i
still
remember
well
that
he
always
visited
the
herrn
von
löwenicht
of
and
from
my
earliest
youth
made
me
acquainted
with
these
and
other
eminent
merchants
care
was
also
taken
for
the
fitness
of
the
stuff
and
there
was
a
plentiful
stock
of
different
kinds
of
cloth
serge
and
götting
stuff
besides
the
requisite
lining
so
that
as
far
as
the
materials
were
concerned
we
might
well
venture
to
be
seen
but
the
form
spoiled
almost
everything
for
if
one
of
our
was
anything
of
a
clever
hand
at
sewing
and
making
up
a
coat
which
had
been
cut
out
for
him
in
masterly
fashion
he
was
now
obliged
also
to
cut
out
the
dress
for
himself
which
did
not
always
succeed
to
perfection
in
addition
to
this
my
father
kept
whatever
belonged
to
his
clothing
in
very
good
and
neat
order
and
preserved
more
than
used
it
for
many
years
thus
he
had
a
predilection
for
certain
old
cuts
and
trimmings
by
which
our
dress
sometimes
acquired
a
strange
appearance
in
this
same
way
had
the
wardrobe
which
i
took
with
me
to
the
university
been
furnished
it
was
very
complete
and
handsome
and
there
was
even
a
laced
suit
amongst
the
rest
already
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
attire
i
thought
myself
sufficiently
well
dressed
but
it
was
not
long
before
my
female
friends
first
by
gentle
raillery
then
by
sensible
remonstrances
convinced
me
that
i
looked
as
if
i
had
dropped
down
out
of
another
world
much
as
i
felt
vexed
at
this
i
did
not
at
first
see
how
i
could
help
myself
but
when
herr
von
masuren
the
favourite
poetical
country
squire
once
entered
the
theatre
in
a
similar
costume
and
was
heartily
laughed
at
more
by
reason
of
his
external
than
his
internal
absurdity
i
took
courage
and
ventured
at
once
to
exchange
my
whole
wardrobe
for
a
one
suited
to
the
place
by
which
however
it
shrunk
considerably
after
this
trial
was
surmounted
a
new
one
was
to
make
its
appearance
which
proved
to
be
far
more
unpleasant
because
it
concerned
a
matter
which
one
does
not
so
easily
put
off
and
exchange
i
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
dialect
and
although
my
father
always
laboured
after
a
certain
purity
of
language
and
from
our
youth
upwards
had
made
us
children
attentive
to
what
may
be
really
called
the
defects
of
that
idiom
and
so
prepared
us
for
a
better
maimer
of
speaking
i
retained
nevertheless
many
peculiarities
which
because
they
pleased
me
by
their
i
was
fond
of
making
conspicuous
and
thus
every
time
i
used
them
incurred
a
severe
reprimand
from
my
new
the
and
perhaps
chiefly
he
who
lives
by
the
rhine
and
maine
for
great
rivers
like
the
always
have
something
animating
about
them
expresses
himself
much
in
similes
and
allusions
and
makes
use
of
proverbial
sayings
with
a
native
aptness
in
both
cases
he
is
often
blunt
but
when
one
sees
the
drift
of
the
expression
it
is
always
appropriate
only
something
to
be
sure
may
often
slip
in
which
proves
offensive
to
a
more
delicate
ear
provincial
dialect
every
province
loves
its
own
dialect
for
it
is
properly
speaking
the
element
in
which
the
soul
draws
its
breath
but
every
one
knows
with
what
obstinacy
the
misnian
dialect
has
contrived
to
domineer
over
the
rest
and
even
for
a
long
time
to
exclude
them
we
have
suffered
for
many
years
under
this
pedantic
tyranny
and
only
by
reiterated
struggles
have
all
the
provinces
again
established
themselves
in
their
ancient
rights
what
a
lively
young
man
had
to
endure
from
this
continual
tutoring
may
be
easily
inferred
by
any
one
who
reflects
that
modes
of
thought
imagination
feeling
native
character
must
be
sacrificed
with
the
pronunciation
which
one
at
last
consents
to
alter
and
this
intolerable
demand
was
made
by
men
and
women
of
education
whose
convictions
i
could
not
adopt
whose
injustice
i
believed
i
felt
though
i
was
unable
to
make
it
plain
to
myself
allusions
to
the
pithy
biblical
texts
were
to
be
forbidden
me
as
well
as
the
use
of
the
expressions
from
the
chronicles
i
had
to
forget
that
i
had
read
the
von
and
eschew
the
use
of
proverbs
which
nevertheless
instead
of
much
just
hit
the
nail
upon
the
head
all
this
which
i
had
appropriated
to
myself
with
youthful
ardour
i
was
now
to
do
without
i
felt
myself
paralyzed
to
the
core
and
scarcely
knew
any
more
how
i
had
to
express
myself
on
the
commonest
things
i
was
told
besides
that
one
should
speak
as
one
writes
and
write
as
one
speaks
while
to
me
speaking
and
writing
seemed
once
for
all
two
different
things
each
of
which
might
well
maintain
its
own
rights
and
even
in
the
misnian
dialect
had
i
to
hear
many
things
which
would
have
made
no
great
figure
on
paper
every
one
who
perceives
in
this
the
influence
which
men
and
women
of
education
the
learned
and
other
persons
who
take
pleasure
in
refined
society
so
decidedly
exercise
over
a
young
student
would
be
immediately
convinced
that
we
were
in
leipzig
even
if
it
had
not
been
mentioned
each
one
of
the
german
universities
has
a
particular
character
for
as
no
universal
cultivation
can
pervade
our
fatherland
every
place
adheres
to
its
own
fashion
and
carries
out
even
to
the
last
its
own
characteristic
peculiarities
exactly
the
same
thing
holds
good
of
the
universities
in
jena
and
halle
roughness
had
been
carried
to
the
highest
pitch
bodily
strength
skill
in
fighting
the
wildest
was
there
the
order
of
the
day
and
such
a
state
of
affairs
can
only
be
maintained
and
propagated
by
the
most
universal
riot
the
relations
of
the
students
to
the
inhabitants
of
those
cities
various
as
they
might
be
nevertheless
agreed
in
this
that
the
wild
stranger
had
no
regard
for
the
citizen
and
looked
upon
himself
as
a
peculiar
being
privileged
to
all
sorts
of
freedom
and
insolence
in
leipzig
on
the
contrary
a
student
could
scarcely
be
anything
else
than
polite
as
soon
as
he
wished
to
stand
on
any
footing
at
all
with
the
rich
and
punctilious
inhabitants
all
politeness
indeed
when
it
does
not
present
itself
as
the
flowering
of
a
great
and
comprehensive
mode
of
life
must
appear
restrained
stationary
and
from
some
points
of
view
perhaps
absurd
and
so
those
wild
huntsmen
from
the
saale
thought
they
had
a
great
superiority
over
the
tame
shepherds
on
the
pleisse
will
always
be
a
valuable
document
from
which
the
manner
of
life
and
thought
at
that
time
rises
visibly
forth
as
in
general
his
poems
must
be
welcome
to
every
one
who
wishes
to
form
for
himself
a
conception
of
the
then
prevailing
state
of
social
life
and
manners
which
was
indeed
feeble
but
amiable
on
account
of
its
innocence
and
childlike
simplicity
all
manners
which
result
from
the
given
relations
of
a
common
existence
are
indestructible
and
in
my
time
many
things
still
reminded
us
of
zachariä
epic
poem
only
one
of
our
thought
himself
rich
and
independent
enough
to
snap
his
fingers
at
public
opinion
he
drank
acquaintance
with
all
the
whom
he
allowed
to
sit
inside
the
coach
as
if
they
were
gentlemen
while
he
drove
them
on
the
box
thought
it
a
great
joke
to
upset
them
now
and
then
and
contrived
to
satisfy
them
for
their
smashed
vehicles
as
well
as
for
their
occasional
bruises
but
otherwise
he
did
no
harm
to
any
one
seeming
only
to
make
a
mock
of
the
public
once
on
a
most
beautiful
he
and
a
comrade
of
his
seized
upon
the
donkeys
of
the
miller
in
and
in
their
shoes
and
stockings
they
rode
around
the
city
with
the
greatest
solemnity
stared
at
by
all
the
promenaders
with
whom
the
glacis
was
swarming
when
some
sensible
persons
remonstrated
with
him
on
the
subject
he
assured
them
quite
unembarrassed
that
he
only
wanted
to
see
how
the
lord
christ
might
have
looked
in
a
like
case
yet
he
found
no
imitators
and
few
companions
at
leipzig
for
the
student
of
any
wealth
and
standing
had
every
reason
to
show
himself
attentive
to
the
mercantile
class
and
to
be
the
more
solicitous
about
the
proper
external
forms
as
the
colony
exhibited
a
model
of
french
manners
the
professors
opulent
both
from
their
private
property
and
from
their
liberal
salaries
were
not
dependent
upon
their
scholars
and
many
subjects
of
the
state
educated
at
the
government
schools
or
other
gymnasia
and
hoping
for
preferment
did
not
venture
to
throw
off
the
traditional
customs
the
neighbourhood
of
dresden
the
attention
paid
to
us
from
thence
and
the
true
piety
of
the
superintendent
of
the
course
of
study
could
not
be
without
a
moral
nay
a
religious
influence
at
first
this
kind
of
life
was
not
repugnant
to
me
my
letters
of
introduction
had
given
me
the
into
good
families
whose
circle
of
relatives
also
received
me
well
but
as
i
was
soon
forced
to
feel
that
the
company
had
much
to
find
fault
with
in
me
and
that
after
dressing
myself
in
their
fashion
i
must
now
talk
according
to
their
tongue
also
and
as
moreover
i
could
plainly
see
that
i
was
on
the
other
hand
but
little
benefited
by
the
instruction
and
mental
improvement
i
had
promised
myself
from
my
academical
residence
i
began
to
be
lazy
and
to
neglect
the
social
duties
of
visiting
and
other
attentions
and
indeed
i
should
have
sooner
withdrawn
from
all
such
connexions
had
not
fear
and
esteem
bound
me
fast
to
hofrath
böhme
and
confidence
and
affection
to
his
wife
the
husband
unfortunately
had
not
the
happy
gift
of
dealing
with
young
people
of
winning
their
confidence
and
of
guiding
them
for
the
moment
as
occasion
might
require
when
i
visited
him
i
never
got
any
good
by
it
his
wife
on
the
contrary
showed
a
genuine
interest
in
me
her
ill
health
kept
her
constantly
at
home
she
invited
me
to
spend
many
an
evening
with
her
and
knew
how
to
direct
and
improve
me
in
many
little
external
particulars
for
my
manners
were
good
indeed
but
i
was
not
yet
master
of
what
is
properly
termed
only
one
female
friend
spent
the
evenings
with
her
but
she
was
more
dictatorial
and
pedantic
for
which
reason
she
displeased
me
excessively
and
out
of
spite
to
her
i
often
resumed
those
unmannerly
habits
from
which
the
other
had
already
weaned
me
nevertheless
she
always
had
patience
enough
with
me
taught
me
piquet
ombre
and
similar
games
the
knowledge
and
practice
of
which
is
held
indispensable
in
society
but
it
was
in
the
matter
of
taste
that
madame
böhme
had
the
greatest
influence
upon
me
in
a
negative
way
truly
yet
one
in
which
she
agreed
perfectly
with
the
critics
the
gottsched
waters
had
inundated
the
german
world
with
a
true
deluge
which
threatened
to
rise
up
even
over
the
highest
mountains
it
takes
a
long
time
for
such
a
flood
to
subside
again
for
the
mire
to
dry
away
and
as
in
any
epoch
there
are
numberless
aping
poets
so
the
imitation
of
the
flat
and
watery
produced
a
chaos
of
which
now
scarcely
a
notion
remains
to
find
out
that
trash
was
trash
was
hence
the
greatest
sport
yea
the
triumph
of
the
critics
of
those
days
whoever
had
only
a
little
common
sense
was
superficially
acquainted
with
the
ancients
and
was
somewhat
more
familiar
with
the
moderns
thought
himself
provided
with
a
standard
scale
which
he
could
everywhere
apply
madame
böhme
was
an
educated
woman
who
opposed
the
trivial
weak
and
commonplace
she
was
besides
the
wife
of
a
man
who
lived
on
bad
terms
with
poetry
in
general
and
would
not
even
allow
that
of
which
she
perhaps
might
have
somewhat
approved
she
listened
indeed
for
some
time
with
patience
when
i
ventured
to
recite
to
her
the
verse
or
prose
of
famous
poets
who
already
stood
in
good
repute
for
then
as
always
i
knew
by
heart
everything
that
chanced
in
any
degree
to
please
me
but
her
complaisance
was
not
of
long
duration
the
first
whom
she
outrageously
abused
were
the
poets
of
the
weisse
school
who
were
just
then
often
quoted
with
great
applause
and
had
delighted
me
very
particularly
if
i
looked
more
closely
into
the
matter
i
could
not
say
she
was
wrong
i
had
sometimes
even
ventured
to
repeat
to
her
though
anonymously
some
of
my
own
poems
but
these
fared
no
better
than
the
rest
of
the
set
and
thus
in
a
short
time
the
beautiful
variegated
meadows
at
the
foot
of
the
german
parnassus
where
i
was
fond
of
luxuriating
were
mercilessly
mowed
down
and
i
was
even
compelled
to
toss
about
the
drying
hay
myself
and
to
ridicule
that
as
lifeless
which
a
short
time
before
had
given
me
such
lively
joy
german
poetry
without
knowing
it
professor
morus
came
to
strengthen
her
instructions
he
was
an
uncommonly
gentle
and
friendly
man
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
at
the
table
of
hofrath
ludwig
and
who
received
me
very
pleasantly
when
i
begged
the
privilege
of
visiting
him
now
while
making
inquiries
of
him
concerning
antiquity
i
did
not
conceal
from
him
what
delighted
me
among
the
modems
when
he
spoke
about
such
things
with
more
calmness
but
what
was
still
worse
with
more
profundity
than
madame
böhme
and
he
thus
opened
my
eyes
at
first
to
my
greatest
chagrin
but
afterwards
to
my
surprise
and
at
last
to
my
edification
besides
this
there
came
the
with
which
gellert
in
his
course
was
wont
to
warn
us
against
poetry
he
wished
only
for
prose
essays
and
always
criticised
these
first
verses
he
treated
as
a
sorry
addition
and
what
was
the
worst
of
all
even
my
prose
found
little
favour
in
his
eyes
for
after
my
old
fashion
i
used
always
to
lay
as
the
foundation
a
little
romance
which
i
loved
to
work
out
in
the
epistolary
form
the
subjects
were
impassioned
the
style
went
beyond
ordinary
prose
and
the
contents
probably
did
not
display
any
very
deep
knowledge
of
mankind
in
the
author
and
so
i
stood
in
very
little
favour
with
our
professor
although
he
carefully
looked
over
my
labours
as
well
as
those
of
the
others
corrected
them
with
red
ink
and
here
and
there
added
a
moral
remark
many
leaves
of
this
kind
which
i
kept
for
a
long
time
with
satisfaction
have
unfortunately
in
the
course
of
years
at
last
disappeared
from
among
my
papers
if
elderly
persons
wish
to
play
the
pedagogue
properly
they
should
neither
prohibit
nor
render
disagreeable
to
a
young
man
anything
which
gives
him
pleasure
of
whatever
kind
it
may
be
unless
at
the
same
time
they
have
something
else
to
put
in
its
place
or
can
contrive
a
substitute
everybody
protested
against
my
tastes
and
inclinations
and
on
the
other
hand
what
they
commended
to
me
lay
either
so
far
from
me
that
i
could
not
perceive
its
excellencies
or
stood
so
near
me
that
i
thought
it
not
a
whit
better
than
what
they
inveighed
against
i
thus
became
thoroughly
perplexed
on
the
subject
and
promised
myself
the
best
results
from
a
lecture
of
ernesti
on
de
i
learned
something
indeed
from
this
lecture
but
was
not
enlightened
on
the
subject
which
particularly
concerned
me
i
required
a
standard
of
opinion
and
thought
i
perceived
that
nobody
possessed
it
for
no
one
agreed
with
another
even
when
they
brought
forward
examples
and
where
were
we
to
get
a
settled
judgment
when
they
managed
to
reckon
up
against
a
man
like
wieland
so
many
faults
in
his
amiable
writings
which
so
completely
captivated
us
younger
folks
amid
this
manifold
distraction
this
dismemberment
of
my
existence
and
my
studies
it
happened
that
i
took
my
dinners
at
hofrath
ludwig
he
was
a
medical
man
a
botanist
and
his
company
with
the
exception
of
morus
consisted
of
physicians
just
commencing
or
near
the
completion
of
their
studies
now
during
these
hours
i
heard
no
other
conversation
than
about
medicine
or
natural
history
and
my
imagination
was
drawn
over
into
quite
a
new
field
i
heard
the
names
of
haller
linnæus
buffon
mentioned
with
great
respect
and
even
if
disputes
often
arose
about
mistakes
into
which
it
was
said
they
had
fallen
all
agreed
in
the
end
to
honour
the
acknowledged
abundance
of
their
merits
the
subjects
were
entertaining
and
important
and
enchained
my
attention
by
degrees
i
became
familiar
with
many
names
and
a
copious
terminology
which
i
caught
up
the
more
willingly
as
i
was
afraid
to
write
down
a
rhyme
however
spontaneously
it
presented
itself
or
to
read
a
poem
for
i
was
fearful
that
it
might
please
me
at
the
time
and
that
perhaps
immediately
afterwards
like
so
much
else
i
should
be
forced
to
pronounce
it
bad
destruction
of
juvenile
poems
this
uncertainty
of
taste
and
judgment
disquieted
me
more
and
more
every
day
so
that
at
last
i
fell
into
despair
i
had
brought
with
me
those
of
my
youthful
labours
which
i
thought
the
best
partly
because
i
hoped
to
get
some
credit
by
them
partly
that
i
might
be
able
to
test
my
progress
with
greater
certainty
but
i
found
myself
in
the
miserable
situation
in
which
one
is
placed
when
a
complete
change
of
mind
is
required
a
renunciation
of
all
that
one
has
hitherto
loved
and
found
good
however
after
some
time
and
many
struggles
i
conceived
so
great
a
contempt
for
my
labours
begun
and
ended
that
one
day
i
burnt
up
poetry
and
prose
plans
sketches
and
projects
all
together
on
the
kitchen
hearth
and
threw
our
good
old
landlady
into
no
small
fright
and
anxiety
by
the
smoke
which
filled
the
whole
house
this
word
which
signifies
something
like
our
bully
is
specially
used
to
designate
a
fighting
literally
to
strike
two
flies
with
one
flapper
the
river
on
which
halle
is
the
river
that
flows
by
leipzig
was
so
called
because
a
large
and
influential
portion
of
its
citizens
were
sprung
from
a
colony
of
huguenots
who
settled
there
after
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
american
that
is
to
say
the
influence
of
gottsched
on
german
literature
of
which
more
is
said
in
the
next
seventh
book
about
the
condition
of
german
literature
at
that
time
so
much
has
been
written
and
that
so
sufficiently
that
every
one
who
takes
any
interest
in
it
can
be
completely
informed
the
judgments
of
it
are
now
pretty
well
agreed
and
what
at
present
i
intend
to
say
and
disconnectedly
concerning
it
relates
not
so
much
to
how
it
was
constituted
in
itself
as
to
how
it
stood
towards
me
i
will
therefore
first
speak
of
those
things
by
which
the
public
is
particularly
excited
of
those
two
hereditary
foes
of
all
comfortable
life
and
of
all
cheerful
living
poetry
i
mean
satire
and
criticism
in
quiet
times
every
one
will
live
after
his
own
fashion
the
citizen
will
carry
on
his
trade
or
his
business
and
enjoy
the
fruits
of
it
afterwards
thus
will
the
author
too
willingly
compose
something
publish
his
labours
and
since
he
thinks
he
has
done
something
good
and
useful
hope
for
praise
if
not
reward
in
this
tranquillity
the
citizen
is
disturbed
by
the
satirist
the
author
by
the
critic
and
peaceful
society
is
thus
put
into
a
disagreeable
agitation
the
literary
epoch
in
which
i
was
born
was
developed
out
of
the
preceding
one
by
opposition
germany
so
long
inundated
by
foreign
people
interpenetrated
by
other
nations
directed
to
foreign
languages
in
learned
and
diplomatic
transactions
could
not
possibly
cultivate
her
own
together
with
so
many
new
ideas
innumerable
strange
words
were
obtruded
necessarily
and
unnecessarily
upon
her
and
even
for
objects
already
known
people
were
induced
to
make
use
of
foreign
expressions
and
turns
of
language
the
german
having
run
wild
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
in
an
unhappy
tumultuary
state
went
to
school
to
the
french
to
learn
manners
and
to
the
romans
in
order
to
express
himself
properly
but
this
was
to
be
done
in
the
when
the
literal
application
of
those
idioms
and
their
made
both
the
social
and
business
style
ridiculous
besides
this
they
adopted
without
moderation
the
similes
of
the
southern
languages
and
employed
them
most
extravagantly
just
so
they
transferred
the
stately
deportment
of
the
citizens
of
rome
to
the
learned
german
officers
and
were
at
home
nowhere
least
of
all
with
themselves
but
as
in
this
epoch
works
of
genius
had
already
appeared
the
german
sense
of
freedom
and
joy
also
began
to
stir
itself
this
accompanied
by
a
genuine
earnestness
insisted
that
men
should
write
purely
and
naturally
without
the
intermixture
of
foreign
words
and
as
common
intelligible
sense
dictated
by
these
praiseworthy
endeavours
however
the
doors
and
gates
were
thrown
open
to
an
extended
national
insipidity
nay
the
dike
was
dug
through
by
which
the
great
deluge
was
shortly
to
rush
in
meanwhile
a
stiff
pedantry
long
stood
its
ground
in
all
the
four
faculties
until
at
last
much
later
it
fled
for
refuge
from
one
of
them
into
another
men
of
parts
children
of
nature
looking
freely
about
them
had
therefore
two
objects
on
which
they
could
exercise
themselves
against
which
they
could
labour
and
as
the
matter
was
of
no
great
importance
give
a
vent
to
their
petulance
these
were
a
language
disfigured
by
foreign
words
forms
and
turns
of
speech
on
the
one
hand
and
the
worthlessness
of
such
writings
as
had
been
careful
to
keep
themselves
free
from
those
faults
on
the
other
though
it
occurred
to
nobody
that
while
they
were
battling
against
one
evil
the
other
was
called
on
for
assistance
liskow
liskow
a
daring
young
man
first
ventured
to
attack
by
name
a
shallow
silly
writer
whose
awkward
demeanour
soon
gave
him
an
opportunity
to
proceed
still
more
severely
he
then
went
further
and
constantly
aimed
his
scorn
at
particular
persons
and
objects
whom
he
despised
and
sought
to
render
despicable
nay
even
persecuted
them
with
passionate
hatred
but
his
career
was
short
for
he
soon
died
and
was
gradually
forgotten
as
a
restless
irregular
youth
the
talent
and
character
shown
in
what
he
did
although
he
had
accomplished
little
may
have
seemed
valuable
to
his
countrymen
for
the
germans
have
always
shown
a
peculiar
pious
kindliness
to
talents
of
good
promise
when
prematurely
cut
off
suffice
it
to
say
that
liskow
was
very
early
praised
and
recommended
to
us
as
an
excellent
satirist
who
could
have
attained
a
rank
even
above
the
rabener
here
indeed
we
saw
ourselves
no
better
off
than
before
for
we
could
discover
nothing
in
his
writings
except
that
he
had
found
the
silly
silly
which
seemed
to
us
quite
a
matter
of
course
rabener
well
educated
grown
up
under
good
scholastic
instruction
of
a
cheerful
and
by
no
means
passionate
or
malicious
disposition
took
up
general
satire
his
censure
of
the
vices
and
follies
springs
from
the
clear
views
of
a
quiet
common
sense
and
from
a
fixed
moral
conception
of
what
the
world
ought
to
be
his
denunciation
of
faults
and
failings
is
harmless
and
cheerful
and
in
order
to
excuse
even
the
slight
boldness
of
his
writings
it
is
supposed
that
the
improving
of
fools
by
ridicule
is
no
fruitless
undertaking
rabener
personal
character
will
not
easily
appear
again
as
an
able
punctual
man
of
business
he
does
his
duty
and
thus
gains
the
good
opinion
of
his
and
the
confidence
of
his
superiors
along
with
which
he
gives
himself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
a
pleasant
contempt
for
all
that
immediately
surrounds
him
pedantic
vain
youngsters
every
sort
of
narrowness
and
conceit
he
banters
rather
than
satirizes
and
even
his
banter
expresses
no
contempt
just
in
the
same
way
does
he
jest
about
his
own
condition
his
misfortune
his
life
and
his
death
there
is
little
of
the
æsthetic
in
the
manner
in
which
this
writer
treats
his
subjects
in
external
forms
he
is
indeed
varied
enough
but
throughout
he
makes
too
much
use
of
direct
irony
namely
in
praising
the
blameworthy
and
blaming
the
praiseworthy
whereas
this
figure
of
speech
should
be
used
but
extremely
seldom
for
in
the
long
run
it
becomes
annoying
to
men
perplexes
the
weak
while
indeed
it
pleases
the
great
middle
class
who
without
any
special
expense
of
mind
can
fancy
themselves
more
knowing
than
others
but
all
that
he
brings
before
us
and
however
he
does
it
alike
bears
witness
to
his
rectitude
cheerfulness
and
equanimity
so
that
we
always
feel
prepossessed
in
his
favour
the
unbounded
applause
of
his
own
times
was
a
consequence
of
such
moral
excellencies
rabener
that
people
looked
for
originals
to
his
general
descriptions
and
found
them
was
natural
that
individuals
complained
of
him
followed
from
the
above
his
apologies
that
his
satire
is
not
personal
prove
the
spite
which
has
been
provoked
some
of
his
letters
crown
him
at
once
as
a
man
and
an
author
the
confidential
epistle
in
which
he
describes
the
siege
of
dresden
and
how
he
loses
his
house
his
effects
his
writings
and
his
wigs
without
having
his
equanimity
in
the
least
shaken
or
his
cheerfulness
clouded
is
highly
valuable
although
his
contemporaries
and
could
not
forgive
him
his
happy
turn
of
mind
the
letter
where
he
speaks
of
the
decay
of
his
strength
and
of
his
approaching
death
is
in
the
highest
degree
worthy
of
respect
and
rabener
deserves
to
be
honoured
as
a
saint
by
all
cheerful
intelligent
men
who
cheerfully
resign
themselves
to
earthly
events
i
tear
myself
away
from
him
reluctantly
yet
i
would
make
this
remark
his
satire
refers
throughout
to
the
he
lets
us
see
here
and
there
that
he
is
also
well
acquainted
with
the
higher
ranks
but
does
not
hold
it
advisable
to
come
in
contact
with
them
it
may
be
said
that
he
has
had
no
successor
that
no
one
has
been
found
who
could
consider
himself
equal
or
even
similar
to
him
now
for
criticism
and
first
of
all
for
the
theoretic
attempts
it
is
not
going
too
far
when
we
say
that
the
ideal
had
at
that
time
escaped
out
of
the
world
into
religion
it
scarcely
even
made
its
appearance
in
moral
philosophy
of
a
highest
principle
of
art
no
one
had
a
notion
they
put
gottsched
art
of
into
our
hands
it
was
useful
and
instructive
enough
for
it
gave
us
a
historical
information
of
all
the
kinds
of
poetry
as
well
as
of
rhythm
and
its
different
movements
the
poetic
genius
was
presupposed
but
besides
that
the
poet
was
to
have
acquirements
and
even
learning
he
should
possess
taste
and
everything
else
of
that
kind
they
directed
us
at
last
to
of
we
gazed
at
single
golden
maxims
of
this
invaluable
work
but
did
not
know
in
the
least
what
to
do
with
it
as
a
whole
or
how
we
should
use
it
the
swiss
stepped
forth
as
gottsched
antagonists
they
must
take
it
into
their
heads
to
do
something
different
to
accomplish
something
better
accordingly
we
heard
that
they
were
in
fact
superior
breitinger
art
of
was
taken
in
hand
here
we
reached
a
wider
field
but
properly
speaking
only
a
greater
labyrinth
which
was
so
much
the
more
tiresome
as
an
able
man
in
whom
we
had
confidence
was
driving
us
about
in
it
let
a
brief
review
justify
these
words
for
poetry
in
itself
they
had
been
able
to
find
no
fundamental
axiom
it
was
too
spiritual
and
too
volatile
painting
an
art
which
one
could
hold
fast
with
one
eyes
and
follow
step
by
step
with
the
external
senses
seemed
more
favourable
for
such
an
end
the
english
and
french
had
already
theorized
about
plastic
art
and
by
a
comparison
drawn
from
this
it
was
thought
that
poetry
might
be
grounded
the
former
placed
images
before
the
eyes
the
latter
before
the
fancy
poetical
images
therefore
were
the
first
thing
which
was
taken
into
consideration
people
began
with
comparisons
descriptions
followed
and
only
that
was
expressed
which
had
always
been
apparent
to
the
external
senses
images
then
but
where
should
these
images
be
got
except
from
nature
the
painter
professedly
imitated
nature
why
not
the
poet
also
but
nature
as
she
lies
before
us
can
not
be
imitated
she
contains
so
much
that
is
insignificant
and
worthless
that
one
must
make
a
selection
but
what
determines
the
choice
one
must
select
that
which
is
important
but
what
is
important
to
answer
this
question
the
swiss
may
have
taken
a
long
time
to
consider
for
they
came
to
a
notion
which
is
indeed
singular
but
clever
and
even
comical
inasmuch
as
they
say
the
new
is
always
the
most
important
and
after
they
have
considered
this
for
a
while
they
discover
that
the
marvellous
is
always
newer
than
everything
else
they
had
now
pretty
well
collected
their
poetical
requisitions
but
they
had
still
to
consider
that
the
marvellous
might
also
be
empty
and
without
relation
to
man
but
this
relation
demanded
as
necessary
must
be
a
moral
one
from
which
the
improvement
of
mankind
should
manifestly
follow
and
thus
a
poem
had
reached
its
utmost
aim
when
with
everything
else
accomplished
it
was
useful
besides
they
now
wished
to
test
the
different
kinds
of
poetry
according
to
all
these
requisites
those
which
imitated
nature
besides
being
marvellous
and
at
the
same
time
of
a
moral
aim
and
use
were
to
rank
as
the
first
and
highest
and
after
much
deliberation
this
great
preeminence
was
at
last
ascribed
with
the
highest
degree
of
conviction
to
æsop
fables
strange
as
such
a
deduction
may
now
appear
it
had
the
most
decided
influence
on
the
best
minds
that
gellert
and
subsequently
lichtwer
devoted
themselves
to
this
department
that
even
lessing
attempted
to
labour
in
it
that
so
many
others
turned
their
talents
towards
it
speaks
for
the
confidence
which
this
species
of
poetry
had
gained
theory
and
practice
always
act
upon
each
other
one
can
see
from
their
works
what
is
the
men
opinion
and
from
their
opinions
predict
what
they
will
do
bodmer
breitinger
guenther
yet
we
must
not
dismiss
our
swiss
theory
without
doing
it
justice
bodmer
with
all
the
pains
he
took
remained
theoretically
and
practically
a
child
all
his
life
breitinger
was
an
able
learned
sagacious
man
whom
when
he
looked
rightly
about
him
the
essentials
of
a
poem
did
not
all
escape
nay
it
can
be
shown
that
he
may
have
dimly
felt
the
deficiencies
of
his
system
remarkable
for
instance
is
his
query
whether
a
certain
descriptive
poem
by
könig
on
the
of
augustus
the
is
properly
a
poem
and
the
answer
to
it
displays
good
sense
but
it
may
serve
for
his
complete
justification
that
he
starting
from
a
false
point
on
a
circle
almost
run
out
already
still
struck
upon
the
main
principle
and
at
the
end
of
his
book
finds
himself
compelled
to
recommend
as
additions
so
to
speak
the
representation
of
manners
character
passions
in
short
the
whole
inner
man
to
which
indeed
poetry
belongs
it
may
well
be
imagined
into
what
perplexity
young
minds
felt
themselves
thrown
by
such
dislocated
maxims
laws
and
shivered
up
dogmas
we
adhered
to
examples
and
there
too
were
no
better
off
foreigners
as
well
as
the
ancients
stood
too
far
from
us
and
from
the
best
native
poets
always
peeped
out
a
decided
individuality
to
the
good
points
of
which
we
could
not
lay
claim
and
into
the
faults
of
which
we
could
not
but
be
afraid
of
falling
for
him
who
felt
anything
productive
in
himself
it
was
a
desperate
condition
when
one
considers
closely
what
was
wanting
in
the
german
poetry
it
was
a
material
and
that
too
a
national
one
there
was
never
a
lack
of
talent
here
we
make
mention
only
of
guenther
who
may
be
called
a
poet
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
a
decided
talent
endowed
with
sensuousness
imagination
memory
the
gifts
of
conception
and
representation
productive
in
the
highest
degree
ready
at
rhythm
ingenious
witty
and
of
varied
information
besides
he
possessed
in
short
all
the
requisites
for
creating
by
means
of
poetry
a
second
life
within
life
even
within
common
real
life
we
admire
the
great
facility
with
which
in
his
occasional
poems
he
elevates
all
circumstances
by
the
feelings
and
embellishes
them
with
suitable
sentiments
images
and
historical
and
fabulous
traditions
their
roughness
and
wildness
belong
to
his
time
his
mode
of
life
and
especially
to
his
character
or
if
one
would
have
it
so
his
want
of
fixed
character
he
did
not
know
how
to
curb
himself
and
so
his
life
like
his
poetry
melted
away
from
him
by
his
vacillating
conduct
günther
had
trifled
away
the
good
fortune
of
being
appointed
at
the
court
of
augustus
the
second
where
in
addition
to
every
other
species
of
ostentation
they
were
also
looking
about
for
a
who
could
give
elevation
and
grace
to
their
festivities
and
immortalize
a
transitory
pomp
von
koenig
was
more
mannerly
and
more
fortunate
he
filled
this
post
with
dignity
and
applause
in
all
sovereign
states
the
material
for
poetry
comes
downwards
from
above
and
the
at
lustlager
bei
was
perhaps
the
first
worthy
object
provincial
if
not
national
which
presented
itself
to
a
poet
two
kings
saluting
one
another
in
the
presence
of
a
great
host
their
whole
courts
and
military
state
around
them
troops
a
of
all
kinds
this
is
business
enough
for
the
outward
sense
and
overflowing
material
for
delineating
and
descriptive
poetry
this
subject
had
indeed
the
internal
defect
that
it
was
only
pomp
and
show
from
which
no
real
action
could
result
none
except
the
very
first
distinguished
themselves
and
even
if
they
had
done
so
the
poet
could
not
render
any
one
conspicuous
lest
he
should
offend
the
others
he
had
to
consult
the
and
state
and
the
delineation
of
the
persons
therefore
went
off
pretty
drily
nay
even
his
contemporaries
very
strongly
reproached
him
with
having
described
the
horses
better
than
the
men
but
should
not
this
redound
to
his
credit
that
he
showed
his
art
just
where
an
object
for
it
presented
itself
the
main
difficulty
too
seems
soon
to
have
manifested
itself
to
him
since
the
poem
never
advanced
beyond
the
first
canto
schlosser
amidst
such
studies
and
reflections
an
unexpected
event
surprised
me
and
frustrated
my
laudable
design
of
becoming
acquainted
with
our
new
literature
from
the
beginning
my
countryman
john
george
schlosser
after
spending
his
academical
years
with
industry
and
exertion
had
repaired
to
in
the
customary
profession
of
an
advocate
but
his
mind
aspiring
and
seeking
after
the
universal
could
not
reconcile
itself
to
this
situation
for
many
reasons
he
accepted
without
hesitation
an
office
as
private
secretary
to
the
duke
ludwig
of
wurtemberg
who
resided
in
treptow
for
the
prince
was
named
among
those
great
men
who
in
a
noble
and
independent
manner
purposed
to
enlighten
themselves
their
families
and
the
world
and
to
unite
for
higher
aims
it
was
this
prince
ludwig
who
to
ask
advice
about
the
education
of
his
children
had
written
to
rousseau
whose
answer
began
with
the
phrase
le
malheur
né
not
only
in
the
affairs
of
the
prince
but
also
in
the
education
of
his
children
schlosser
was
now
willingly
to
assist
in
word
and
deed
if
not
to
superintend
them
this
noble
young
man
who
harboured
the
best
will
and
laboured
after
a
perfect
purity
of
morals
would
have
easily
kept
men
from
him
by
a
certain
dry
austerity
if
his
fine
and
rare
literary
cultivation
his
knowledge
of
languages
and
his
facility
at
expressing
himself
by
writing
both
in
verse
and
prose
had
not
attracted
every
one
and
made
living
with
him
more
agreeable
it
had
been
announced
to
me
that
he
would
pass
through
leipzig
and
i
expected
him
with
longing
he
came
and
put
up
at
a
little
inn
or
that
stood
in
the
marsh
and
the
host
of
which
was
named
schönkopf
this
man
had
a
frankfort
woman
for
his
wife
and
although
he
entertained
few
persons
during
the
rest
of
the
year
and
could
lodge
no
guests
in
his
little
house
yet
at
he
was
visited
by
many
frankforters
who
used
to
eat
and
in
case
of
need
even
take
quarters
there
also
thither
i
hastened
to
seek
after
schlosser
when
he
had
sent
to
inform
me
of
his
arrival
i
scarcely
remembered
having
seen
him
before
and
found
a
young
man
with
a
round
compressed
face
without
the
features
losing
their
sharpness
on
that
account
the
form
of
his
rounded
forehead
between
black
eyebrows
and
locks
indicated
earnestness
sternness
and
perhaps
obstinacy
he
was
in
a
certain
measure
the
opposite
of
myself
and
this
very
thing
doubtless
laid
the
foundation
of
our
lasting
friendship
i
had
the
greatest
respect
for
his
talents
the
more
so
as
i
very
well
saw
that
in
the
certainty
with
which
he
acted
and
produced
he
was
completely
my
superior
the
respect
and
the
confidence
which
i
showed
him
confirmed
his
affection
and
increased
the
indulgence
he
was
compelled
to
have
for
my
lively
impetuous
and
disposition
in
such
contrast
with
his
own
he
studied
the
english
writers
diligently
pope
if
not
his
model
was
his
aim
and
in
opposition
to
that
on
he
had
written
a
poem
in
like
form
and
measure
which
was
to
give
the
christian
religion
the
triumph
over
the
deism
of
the
other
work
from
the
great
store
of
papers
which
he
carried
with
him
he
showed
me
poetical
and
prose
compositions
in
all
languages
which
as
they
challenged
me
to
imitation
once
more
gave
me
infinite
disquietude
yet
i
contrived
to
help
myself
immediately
by
activity
i
wrote
german
french
english
and
italian
poems
addressed
to
him
the
of
which
i
took
from
our
conversations
which
were
always
important
and
instructive
schlosser
did
not
wish
to
leave
leipzig
without
having
seen
face
to
face
the
men
who
had
a
name
i
willingly
took
him
to
those
i
knew
with
those
whom
i
had
not
yet
visited
i
in
this
way
became
honourably
acquainted
since
he
was
received
with
distinction
as
a
man
of
education
of
already
established
character
and
well
knew
how
to
pay
for
the
outlay
of
conversation
i
can
not
pass
over
our
visit
to
gottsched
as
it
exemplifies
the
character
and
manners
of
that
man
he
lived
very
respectably
in
the
first
story
of
the
golden
bear
where
the
elder
breitkopf
on
account
of
the
great
advantage
which
writings
translations
and
other
aids
had
brought
to
the
trade
had
promised
him
a
lodging
for
life
we
were
announced
the
servant
led
us
into
a
large
chamber
saying
his
master
would
come
immediately
now
whether
we
misunderstood
a
gesture
which
he
made
i
can
not
say
it
is
enough
we
thought
he
directed
us
into
an
adjoining
room
we
entered
and
to
a
singular
scene
for
on
the
instant
gottsched
that
tall
broad
gigantic
man
came
in
at
the
opposite
door
in
a
of
green
damask
lined
with
red
taffeta
but
his
monstrous
head
was
bald
and
uncovered
this
however
was
to
be
immediately
provided
for
the
servant
sprang
in
at
a
with
a
great
wig
in
his
hand
the
curls
came
down
to
the
elbows
and
handed
the
to
his
master
with
gestures
of
terror
gottsched
without
manifesting
the
least
vexation
raised
the
wig
from
the
servant
arm
with
his
left
hand
and
while
he
very
dexterously
swung
it
up
on
his
head
gave
the
poor
fellow
such
a
box
on
the
ear
with
his
right
paw
that
the
latter
as
often
happens
in
a
comedy
went
spinning
out
at
the
door
whereupon
the
respectable
old
grandfather
invited
us
quite
gravely
to
be
seated
and
kept
up
a
pretty
long
discourse
with
good
grace
at
leipzig
as
long
as
schlosser
remained
in
leipzig
i
dined
daily
with
him
and
became
acquainted
with
a
very
pleasant
set
of
boarders
some
livonians
and
the
son
of
hermann
chief
in
dresden
afterwards
burgermaster
in
leipzig
and
their
tutor
hofrath
pfeil
author
of
the
von
a
continuation
of
gellert
zachariæ
a
brother
of
the
poet
and
krebel
editor
of
geographical
and
genealogical
manuals
all
these
were
polite
cheerful
and
friendly
men
zachariä
was
the
most
quiet
pfeil
an
elegant
man
who
had
something
almost
diplomatic
about
him
yet
without
affectation
and
with
great
krebel
a
genuine
falstaff
tall
corpulent
fair
with
prominent
merry
eyes
as
bright
as
the
sky
always
happy
and
in
good
spirits
these
persons
all
treated
me
in
the
most
handsome
manner
partly
on
schlosser
account
partly
too
on
account
of
my
own
frank
and
obliging
disposition
and
it
needed
no
great
persuasion
to
make
me
partake
of
their
table
in
future
in
fact
i
remained
with
them
after
schlosser
departure
deserted
table
and
found
myself
so
much
the
better
off
in
this
society
which
was
limited
to
a
certain
number
as
i
was
very
well
pleased
with
the
daughter
of
the
family
a
very
neat
pretty
girl
and
had
opportunities
to
exchange
friendly
glances
with
her
a
comfort
which
i
had
neither
sought
nor
found
by
accident
since
the
mischance
with
gretchen
i
spent
the
with
my
friends
cheerfully
and
profitably
krebel
indeed
loved
me
and
continued
to
teaze
me
and
stimulate
me
in
moderation
pfeil
on
the
contrary
showed
his
earnest
affection
for
me
by
trying
to
guide
and
settle
my
judgment
upon
many
points
during
this
intercourse
i
perceived
through
conversation
through
examples
and
through
my
own
reflections
that
the
first
step
in
delivering
ourselves
from
the
empty
epoch
could
be
taken
only
by
definiteness
precision
and
brevity
in
the
style
which
had
hitherto
prevailed
one
could
not
distinguish
the
commonplace
from
what
was
better
since
all
were
brought
down
to
a
level
with
each
other
authors
had
already
tried
to
escape
from
this
widespread
disease
with
more
or
less
success
haller
and
ramler
were
inclined
to
compression
by
nature
lessing
and
wieland
were
led
to
it
by
reflection
the
former
became
by
degrees
quite
epigrammatical
in
his
poems
terse
in
laconic
in
it
was
not
till
afterwards
that
he
returned
to
that
serene
which
becomes
him
so
well
in
wieland
who
had
been
occasionally
prolix
in
and
the
becomes
condensed
and
precise
to
a
wonderful
degree
as
well
as
exceedingly
graceful
in
and
klopstock
in
the
first
cantos
of
the
is
not
without
diffuseness
in
his
and
other
minor
poems
he
appears
compressed
as
also
in
his
tragedies
by
his
emulation
of
the
ancients
especially
tacitus
he
sees
himself
constantly
forced
into
narrower
limits
by
which
he
at
last
becomes
obscure
and
unpalatable
gerstenberg
a
fine
but
eccentric
talent
also
distinguishes
himself
his
merit
is
appreciated
but
on
the
whole
he
gives
little
pleasure
gleim
diffuse
and
easy
by
nature
is
scarcely
once
concise
in
his
ramler
is
properly
more
a
critic
than
a
poet
he
begins
to
collect
what
the
germans
have
accomplished
in
lyric
poetry
he
now
finds
that
scarcely
one
poem
fully
satisfies
him
he
must
leave
out
arrange
and
alter
that
the
things
may
have
some
shape
or
other
by
this
means
he
makes
himself
almost
as
many
enemies
as
there
are
poets
and
amateurs
since
every
one
properly
speaking
recognizes
himself
only
in
his
defects
and
the
public
interests
itself
sooner
for
a
faulty
individuality
than
for
that
which
is
produced
or
amended
according
to
a
universal
law
of
taste
rhythm
lay
yet
in
the
cradle
and
no
one
knew
of
a
method
to
shorten
its
childhood
poetical
prose
came
into
the
ascendant
gessner
and
klopstock
excited
many
imitators
others
again
still
demanded
an
intelligible
metre
and
translated
this
prose
into
rhythm
but
even
these
gave
nobody
satisfaction
for
they
were
obliged
to
omit
and
add
and
the
prose
original
always
passed
for
the
better
of
the
two
but
the
more
with
all
this
conciseness
is
aimed
at
the
more
does
a
judgment
become
possible
since
that
which
is
important
being
more
closely
compressed
allows
a
certain
comparison
at
last
it
happened
also
at
the
same
time
that
many
kinds
of
truly
poetical
forms
arose
for
as
they
tried
to
represent
only
what
was
necessary
in
the
objects
they
wished
to
imitate
they
were
forced
to
do
justice
to
every
one
of
these
and
in
this
manner
though
no
one
did
it
consciously
the
modes
of
representation
multiplied
themselves
among
which
indeed
were
some
which
were
really
caricatures
while
many
an
attempt
proved
unsuccessful
wieland
without
question
wieland
possessed
the
finest
natural
gifts
of
all
he
had
early
cultivated
himself
thoroughly
in
those
ideal
regions
where
youth
so
readily
lingers
but
when
by
what
is
called
experience
by
the
events
of
the
world
and
women
these
were
rendered
distasteful
to
him
he
threw
himself
on
the
side
of
the
actual
and
pleased
himself
and
others
with
the
contest
of
the
two
worlds
where
in
light
skirmishing
between
jest
and
earnest
his
talent
displayed
itself
most
beautifully
how
many
of
his
brilliant
productions
fall
into
the
time
of
my
academic
years
had
the
most
effect
upon
me
and
i
can
yet
remember
the
place
and
the
very
spot
where
i
got
sight
of
the
first
which
oeser
gave
me
here
it
was
that
i
believed
i
saw
antiquity
again
living
and
fresh
everything
that
is
plastic
in
wieland
genius
here
showed
itself
in
its
highest
perfection
and
when
that
condemned
to
an
unhappy
insipidity
finally
reconciles
himself
to
his
mistress
and
to
the
world
one
can
well
with
him
live
through
the
misanthropical
epoch
for
the
rest
we
willingly
conceded
to
these
works
a
cheerful
aversion
from
those
exalted
sentiments
which
by
reason
of
their
easy
misapplication
to
life
are
often
open
to
the
suspicion
of
dreaminess
we
pardoned
the
author
for
prosecuting
with
ridicule
what
we
held
as
true
and
reverend
the
more
readily
as
he
thereby
gave
us
to
understand
that
it
caused
him
continual
trouble
how
miserably
criticism
then
received
such
labours
may
be
seen
from
the
first
volumes
of
the
german
of
the
there
is
honourable
mention
but
there
is
no
trace
of
any
insight
into
the
character
of
the
kind
of
poetry
the
reviewer
like
every
one
at
that
time
had
formed
his
taste
on
examples
he
never
takes
it
into
consideration
that
in
a
judgment
of
such
parodistical
works
one
must
first
of
all
have
before
one
eyes
the
original
noble
beautiful
object
in
order
to
see
whether
the
parodist
has
really
gotten
from
it
a
weak
and
comical
side
whether
he
has
borrowed
anything
from
it
or
under
the
appearance
of
such
an
imitation
has
perhaps
given
us
an
excellent
invention
of
his
own
of
all
this
there
is
not
a
notion
but
the
poems
are
praised
and
blamed
by
passages
the
reviewer
as
he
himself
confesses
has
marked
so
much
that
pleased
him
that
he
can
not
quote
it
all
in
print
when
they
even
meet
the
highly
meritorious
translation
of
shakspeare
with
the
exclamation
by
rights
a
man
like
shakspeare
should
not
have
been
translated
at
all
it
will
be
understood
without
further
remark
how
infinitely
the
german
was
behindhand
in
matters
of
taste
and
that
young
people
animated
by
true
feeling
had
to
look
about
them
for
other
guiding
stars
the
material
which
in
this
manner
more
or
less
determined
the
form
the
germans
sought
everywhere
they
had
handled
few
national
subjects
or
none
at
all
schlegel
only
showed
the
way
the
idyllic
tendency
extended
itself
without
end
the
want
of
distinctive
character
with
gessner
with
all
his
great
gracefulness
and
childlike
heartiness
made
every
one
think
that
he
could
do
something
of
the
same
kind
just
in
the
same
manner
out
of
the
more
generally
human
some
snatch
those
poems
which
should
have
portrayed
a
foreign
nationality
as
for
instance
the
jewish
pastoral
poems
those
on
the
patriarchs
altogether
and
whatever
else
related
to
the
old
testament
bodmer
was
a
perfect
symbol
of
the
watery
deluge
that
swelled
high
around
the
german
parnassus
and
which
abated
but
slowly
the
of
anacreon
likewise
allowed
innumerable
mediocre
geniuses
to
reel
about
at
large
the
precision
of
horace
compelled
the
germans
though
but
slowly
to
conform
to
him
comic
heroic
poems
mostly
after
the
model
of
pope
of
the
did
not
serve
to
bring
in
a
better
time
yet
i
must
here
mention
a
delusion
which
operated
as
seriously
as
it
must
be
ridiculous
when
one
examines
it
more
closely
the
germans
had
now
sufficient
historical
knowledge
of
all
the
kinds
of
poetry
in
which
the
different
nations
had
distinguished
themselves
this
work
which
properly
speaking
totally
destroys
the
inner
conception
of
poetry
had
been
already
pretty
completely
hammered
together
by
gottsched
in
his
art
of
and
it
had
been
shown
at
the
same
time
that
german
poets
too
had
already
known
how
to
fill
up
all
the
rubrics
with
excellent
works
and
thus
it
ever
went
on
each
year
the
collection
was
more
considerable
but
every
year
one
work
pushed
another
out
of
the
place
in
which
it
had
hitherto
shone
we
now
possessed
if
not
homers
yet
virgils
and
miltons
if
not
a
pindar
yet
a
horace
of
theocrituses
there
was
no
lack
and
thus
they
weighed
themselves
by
comparisons
from
without
whilst
the
mass
of
poetical
works
always
increased
so
that
at
last
there
could
be
a
comparison
from
within
popular
philosophy
now
though
matters
of
taste
stood
on
a
very
uncertain
footing
there
could
be
no
dispute
but
that
within
the
protestant
part
of
germany
and
of
switzerland
what
is
generally
called
began
to
bestir
itself
briskly
at
that
epoch
the
scholastic
philosophy
which
always
has
the
merit
of
propounding
according
to
received
axioms
in
a
favourite
order
and
under
fixed
rubrics
everything
about
which
man
can
at
all
inquire
had
by
the
frequent
darkness
and
apparent
uselessness
of
its
by
its
unseasonable
application
of
a
method
in
itself
respectable
and
by
its
too
great
extension
over
so
many
subjects
made
itself
foreign
to
the
mass
unpalatable
and
at
last
superfluous
many
a
one
became
convinced
that
nature
had
endowed
him
with
as
great
a
portion
of
good
and
straightforward
sense
as
perchance
he
required
to
form
such
a
clear
notion
of
objects
that
he
could
manage
them
and
turn
them
to
his
own
profit
and
that
of
others
without
laboriously
troubling
himself
about
the
most
universal
problems
and
inquiring
how
the
most
remote
things
which
do
not
particularly
affect
us
may
hang
together
men
made
the
trial
opened
their
eyes
looked
straight
before
them
observant
industrious
active
and
believed
that
when
one
judges
and
acts
correctly
in
own
circle
one
may
well
presume
to
speak
of
other
things
also
which
lie
at
a
greater
distance
in
accordance
with
such
a
notion
every
one
was
now
entitled
not
only
to
philosophize
but
also
by
degrees
to
consider
himself
a
philosopher
philosophy
therefore
was
more
or
less
sound
and
practised
common
sense
which
ventured
lo
enter
upon
the
universal
and
to
decide
upon
inner
and
outer
experiences
a
acuteness
and
an
especial
moderation
while
the
middle
path
and
fairness
to
all
opinions
was
held
to
be
right
procured
respect
and
confidence
for
writings
and
oral
statements
of
the
sort
and
thus
at
last
philosophers
were
found
in
all
the
faculties
nay
in
all
classes
and
trades
in
this
way
the
theologians
could
not
help
inclining
to
what
is
called
natural
religion
and
when
the
discussion
was
how
far
the
light
of
nature
may
suffice
to
advance
us
in
the
knowledge
of
god
and
the
improving
and
ennobling
of
ourselves
they
commonly
ventured
to
decide
in
its
favour
without
much
scruple
according
to
the
same
principle
of
moderation
they
then
granted
equal
rights
to
all
positive
religions
by
which
they
all
became
alike
indifferent
and
uncertain
for
the
rest
they
let
everything
stand
and
since
the
bible
is
so
full
of
matter
that
more
than
any
other
book
it
offers
material
for
reflection
and
opportunity
for
meditation
on
human
affairs
it
could
still
as
before
be
always
laid
as
the
foundation
of
all
sermons
and
other
religious
treatises
but
over
this
work
as
well
as
over
the
whole
body
of
profane
writers
was
impending
a
singular
fate
which
in
the
lapse
of
time
was
not
to
be
averted
hitherto
it
had
been
received
as
a
matter
of
implicit
faith
that
this
book
of
books
was
composed
in
one
spirit
that
it
was
even
inspired
and
as
it
were
dictated
by
the
divine
spirit
yet
already
for
a
long
time
the
discrepancies
of
the
different
parts
of
it
had
been
now
cavilled
at
now
apologized
for
by
believers
and
unbelievers
english
french
and
germans
had
attacked
the
bible
with
more
or
less
violence
acuteness
audacity
and
wantonness
and
just
as
often
had
it
been
taken
under
the
protection
of
earnest
men
of
each
nation
as
for
myself
i
loved
and
valued
it
for
almost
to
it
alone
did
i
owe
my
moral
culture
and
the
events
the
doctrines
the
symbols
the
similes
had
all
impressed
themselves
deeply
upon
me
and
had
influenced
me
in
one
way
or
another
these
unjust
scoffing
and
perverting
attacks
therefore
disgusted
me
but
people
had
already
gone
so
far
as
very
willingly
to
admit
partly
as
a
main
ground
for
the
defence
of
many
passages
that
god
had
accommodated
himself
to
the
modes
of
thought
and
power
of
comprehension
in
men
that
even
those
moved
by
the
spirit
had
not
on
that
account
been
able
to
renounce
their
character
their
individuality
and
that
amos
a
did
not
wield
the
language
of
isaiah
who
is
said
to
have
been
a
prince
state
of
theology
out
of
such
views
and
convictions
especially
with
a
constantly
increasing
knowledge
of
languages
was
very
naturally
developed
that
kind
of
study
by
which
it
was
attempted
to
examine
more
accurately
the
oriental
localities
nationalities
natural
products
and
phenomena
and
in
this
manner
to
make
present
to
that
ancient
time
michaelis
employed
the
whole
strength
of
his
talents
and
his
knowledge
on
this
side
descriptions
of
travels
became
a
powerful
help
in
explaining
the
holy
scriptures
and
later
travellers
furnished
with
numerous
questions
were
made
by
the
answers
to
them
to
bear
witness
for
the
prophets
and
apostles
but
whilst
they
were
on
all
sides
busied
to
bring
the
holy
scriptures
to
a
natural
intuition
and
to
render
peculiar
modes
of
thought
and
representation
in
them
more
universally
comprehensible
that
by
this
aspect
many
an
objection
might
be
removed
many
offensive
things
effaced
and
many
a
shallow
scoffing
be
made
ineffective
there
appeared
in
some
men
just
the
opposite
disposition
since
these
chose
the
darkest
most
mysterious
writings
as
the
subject
of
their
meditations
and
wished
if
not
to
elucidate
them
yet
to
confirm
them
through
internal
evidence
by
means
of
conjectures
calculations
and
other
ingenious
and
strange
combinations
and
so
far
as
they
contained
prophecies
to
prove
them
by
the
results
and
thus
to
justify
a
faith
in
what
was
next
to
be
expected
the
venerable
bengel
had
procured
a
decided
reception
for
his
labours
on
the
revelations
of
john
from
the
fact
that
he
was
known
as
an
intelligent
upright
blameless
man
deep
minds
are
compelled
to
live
in
the
past
as
well
as
in
the
future
the
ordinary
movements
of
the
world
can
be
of
no
importance
to
them
if
they
do
not
in
the
course
of
ages
up
to
the
present
revere
prophecies
which
have
been
revealed
and
in
the
immediate
as
well
as
in
the
most
remote
futurity
predictions
still
veiled
hence
arises
a
connexion
that
is
wanting
in
history
which
seems
to
give
us
only
an
accidental
wavering
backwards
and
forwards
in
a
necessarily
limited
circle
doctor
was
one
of
those
whom
the
prophetic
part
of
scripture
suited
more
than
any
other
since
it
brings
into
action
the
two
most
opposite
qualities
of
human
nature
the
affections
and
the
acuteness
of
the
intellect
many
young
men
had
devoted
themselves
to
this
doctrine
and
already
formed
a
respectable
body
which
attracted
the
more
attention
as
ernesti
with
his
friends
threatened
not
to
illuminate
but
completely
to
disperse
the
obscurity
in
which
these
delighted
hence
arose
controversies
hatred
persecution
and
much
that
was
unpleasant
i
attached
myself
to
the
lucid
party
and
sought
to
appropriate
to
myself
their
principles
and
advantages
although
i
ventured
to
forebode
that
by
this
extremely
praiseworthy
intelligent
method
of
interpretation
the
poetic
contents
of
the
writings
must
at
last
be
lost
along
with
the
prophetical
but
those
who
devoted
themselves
to
german
literature
and
the
were
more
nearly
concerned
with
the
efforts
of
such
men
who
as
jerusalem
zollikofer
and
spalding
tried
by
means
of
a
good
and
pure
style
in
their
sermons
and
treatises
to
gain
even
among
persons
of
a
certain
degree
of
sense
and
taste
applause
and
attachment
for
religion
and
for
the
moral
philosophy
which
is
so
closely
related
to
it
a
pleasing
manner
of
writing
began
to
be
everywhere
necessary
and
since
such
a
manner
must
above
all
be
comprehensible
so
did
writers
arise
on
many
sides
who
undertook
to
write
about
their
studies
and
their
professions
clearly
perspicuously
and
impressively
and
as
well
for
the
adepts
as
for
the
multitude
after
the
example
of
tissot
a
foreigner
the
physicians
also
now
began
to
labour
zealously
for
the
general
cultivation
haller
unzer
zimmerman
had
a
very
great
influence
and
whatever
may
be
said
against
them
in
detail
especially
the
last
they
produced
a
very
great
effect
in
their
time
and
mention
should
be
made
of
this
in
history
but
particularly
in
biography
for
a
man
remains
of
consequence
not
so
far
as
he
leaves
something
behind
him
but
so
far
as
he
acts
and
enjoys
and
rouses
others
to
action
and
enjoyment
the
jurists
accustomed
from
their
youth
upwards
to
an
abstruse
style
which
in
all
legal
papers
from
the
petty
court
of
the
immediate
knight
up
to
the
imperial
diet
at
ratisbon
was
still
maintained
in
all
its
quaintness
could
not
easily
elevate
themselves
to
a
certain
freedom
the
less
so
as
the
subjects
of
which
they
had
to
treat
were
most
intimately
connected
with
the
external
form
and
consequently
also
with
the
style
yet
the
younger
von
moser
had
already
shown
himself
an
independent
and
original
writer
and
putter
by
the
clearness
of
his
delivery
had
also
brought
clearness
into
his
subject
and
the
style
in
which
he
was
to
treat
it
all
that
proceeded
from
his
school
was
distinguished
by
this
and
even
the
philosophers
in
order
to
be
popular
now
found
themselves
compelled
to
write
clearly
and
intelligibly
mendelsohn
and
garve
appeared
and
excited
universal
interest
and
admiration
with
the
cultivation
of
the
german
language
and
style
in
every
department
the
capacity
for
forming
a
judgment
also
increased
and
we
admire
the
reviews
then
published
of
works
upon
religious
and
moral
as
well
as
medical
subjects
while
on
the
contrary
we
remark
that
the
judgments
of
poems
and
of
whatever
else
may
relate
to
the
will
be
found
if
not
pitiful
at
least
very
feeble
this
holds
good
of
the
and
of
the
german
as
well
as
of
the
of
the
belles
notable
instances
of
which
could
easily
be
produced
the
no
matter
in
how
motley
a
manner
all
this
might
be
confused
still
for
every
one
who
contemplated
producing
anything
from
himself
who
would
not
merely
take
the
words
and
phrases
out
of
the
mouths
of
his
predecessors
there
was
nothing
further
left
but
early
and
late
to
look
about
him
for
some
which
he
might
determine
to
use
here
too
we
were
much
led
astray
people
were
constantly
repeating
a
saying
of
kleist
which
we
had
to
hear
often
enough
he
had
sportively
ingeniously
and
truly
replied
to
those
who
took
him
to
task
on
account
of
his
frequent
lonely
walks
that
he
was
not
idle
at
such
times
he
was
going
to
the
image
hunt
this
simile
was
very
suitable
for
a
nobleman
and
soldier
who
by
it
placed
himself
in
contrast
with
the
men
of
his
rank
who
did
not
neglect
going
out
with
their
guns
on
their
shoulders
and
as
often
as
an
opportunity
presented
itself
hence
we
find
in
kleist
poems
many
such
individual
images
happily
seized
although
not
always
happily
elaborated
which
in
a
kindly
manner
remind
us
of
nature
but
now
they
also
recommended
us
quite
seriously
to
go
out
on
the
which
did
not
at
last
leave
us
wholly
without
fruit
although
garden
the
the
rosenthal
golis
raschwitz
and
konnewitz
would
be
the
oddest
ground
to
beat
up
poetical
game
in
and
yet
i
was
often
induced
by
that
motive
to
contrive
that
my
walk
should
be
solitary
and
because
many
objects
neither
beautiful
nor
sublime
met
the
eye
of
the
beholder
and
in
the
truly
splendid
rosenthal
the
gnats
in
the
best
season
of
the
year
allowed
no
tender
thoughts
to
arise
so
did
i
by
unwearied
persevering
endeavour
become
extremely
attentive
to
the
small
life
of
nature
i
would
use
this
word
after
the
analogy
of
still
life
and
since
the
pretty
events
which
one
perceives
within
this
circle
represent
but
little
in
themselves
so
i
accustomed
myself
to
see
in
them
a
significance
which
inclined
now
towards
the
symbolical
now
towards
the
allegorical
side
accordingly
as
intuition
feeling
or
reflection
had
the
preponderance
i
will
relate
one
incident
in
place
of
many
i
was
after
the
fashion
of
humanity
in
love
with
my
name
and
as
young
uneducated
people
commonly
do
i
wrote
it
down
everywhere
once
i
had
carved
it
very
handsomely
and
accurately
on
the
smooth
bark
of
a
of
moderate
age
the
following
autumn
when
my
affection
for
annette
was
in
its
fullest
bloom
i
took
the
trouble
to
cut
hers
above
it
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
in
the
meantime
like
a
capricious
lover
i
had
wantonly
sought
many
opportunities
to
teaze
her
and
cause
her
vexation
in
the
spring
i
chanced
to
visit
the
spot
and
the
sap
which
was
rising
strongly
in
the
trees
had
welled
out
through
the
incisions
which
formed
her
name
and
which
were
not
yet
crusted
over
and
moistened
with
innocent
vegetable
tears
the
already
hardened
traces
of
my
own
thus
to
see
her
here
weeping
over
me
me
who
had
so
often
called
up
her
tears
by
my
filled
me
with
confusion
at
the
remembrance
of
my
injustice
and
of
her
love
even
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
i
hastened
to
implore
pardon
of
her
doubly
and
trebly
and
i
turned
this
incident
into
an
idyl
which
i
never
could
read
to
myself
without
affection
or
to
others
without
emotion
while
i
now
like
a
shepherd
on
the
pleisse
was
absorbed
childishly
enough
in
such
tender
subjects
and
always
chose
only
such
as
i
could
easily
recall
into
my
bosom
provision
from
a
greater
and
more
important
side
had
long
been
made
for
german
poets
the
first
true
and
really
vital
material
of
the
higher
order
came
into
german
poetry
through
frederick
the
great
and
the
deeds
of
the
seven
years
war
all
national
poetry
must
be
shallow
or
become
shallow
which
does
not
rest
on
that
which
is
most
universally
human
upon
the
events
of
nations
and
their
shepherds
when
both
stand
for
one
man
kings
are
to
be
represented
in
war
and
danger
where
by
that
very
means
they
appear
as
the
first
because
they
determine
and
share
the
fate
of
the
very
least
and
thus
become
much
more
interesting
than
the
gods
themselves
who
when
they
have
once
determined
the
fates
withdraw
from
all
participation
in
them
in
this
view
of
the
subject
every
nation
if
it
would
be
worth
anything
at
all
must
possess
an
epopee
to
which
the
precise
form
of
the
epic
poem
is
not
necessary
the
started
by
gleim
maintain
so
high
a
rank
among
german
poems
because
they
arose
with
and
in
the
achievements
which
are
their
subject
and
because
moreover
their
felicitous
form
just
as
if
a
had
produced
them
in
the
loftiest
moments
makes
us
feel
the
most
complete
effectiveness
ramler
sings
the
deeds
of
his
king
in
a
different
and
most
noble
manner
all
his
poems
are
full
of
matter
and
occupy
us
with
great
objects
and
thus
already
maintain
an
indestructible
value
for
the
internal
matter
of
the
subject
worked
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
art
it
will
not
indeed
be
denied
that
genius
that
thoroughly
cultivated
artistical
talent
can
make
everything
out
of
everything
by
its
method
of
treatment
and
can
subdue
the
most
refractory
material
but
when
closely
examined
the
result
is
rather
a
trick
of
art
than
a
work
of
art
which
should
rest
upon
a
worthy
object
that
the
treatment
of
it
by
skill
pains
and
industry
may
present
to
us
the
dignity
of
the
only
the
more
happily
and
splendidly
the
prussians
and
with
them
protestant
germany
acquired
thus
for
their
literature
a
treasure
which
the
opposite
party
lacked
and
the
want
of
which
they
have
been
able
to
supply
by
no
subsequent
endeavours
upon
the
great
idea
which
the
prussian
writers
could
well
entertain
of
their
king
they
first
established
themselves
and
the
more
zealously
as
he
in
whose
name
they
did
it
all
wished
once
for
all
to
know
nothing
about
them
already
before
this
through
the
french
colony
afterwards
through
the
king
predilection
for
the
literature
of
that
nation
and
for
their
financial
institutions
had
a
mass
of
french
civilization
come
into
prussia
which
was
highly
advantageous
to
the
germans
since
by
it
they
were
challenged
to
contradiction
and
resistance
thus
the
very
aversion
of
frederick
from
german
was
a
fortunate
thing
for
the
formation
of
its
literary
character
they
did
everything
to
attract
the
king
attention
not
indeed
to
be
honoured
but
only
noticed
by
him
yet
they
did
it
in
german
fashion
from
an
internal
conviction
they
did
what
they
held
to
be
right
and
desired
and
wished
that
the
king
should
recognize
and
prize
this
german
uprightness
that
did
not
and
could
not
happen
for
how
can
it
be
required
of
a
king
who
wishes
to
live
and
enjoy
himself
intellectually
that
he
shall
lose
his
years
in
order
to
see
what
he
thinks
barbarous
developed
and
rendered
palatable
too
late
in
matters
of
trade
and
manufacture
he
might
indeed
force
upon
himself
but
especially
upon
his
people
very
moderate
substitutes
instead
of
excellent
foreign
wares
but
here
everything
comes
to
perfection
more
rapidly
and
it
needs
not
a
man
to
bring
such
things
to
maturity
but
i
must
here
first
of
all
make
honourable
mention
of
one
work
the
most
genuine
production
of
the
seven
years
war
and
of
perfect
north
german
nationality
it
is
the
first
theatrical
production
caught
from
the
important
events
of
life
one
of
specific
temporary
value
and
one
which
therefore
produced
an
incalculable
effect
von
lessing
who
in
opposition
to
klopstock
and
gleim
was
fond
of
casting
off
his
personal
dignity
because
he
was
confident
that
he
could
at
any
moment
seize
it
and
take
it
up
again
delighted
in
a
dissipated
life
in
taverns
and
the
world
as
he
always
needed
a
strong
counterpoise
to
his
powerfully
labouring
interior
and
for
this
reason
also
he
had
joined
the
suite
of
general
tauentzien
one
easily
discovers
how
the
piece
was
generated
betwixt
war
and
peace
hatred
and
affection
it
was
this
production
which
happily
opened
the
view
into
a
higher
more
significant
world
from
the
literary
and
citizen
world
in
which
poetic
art
had
hitherto
moved
the
intense
hatred
in
which
the
prussians
and
saxons
stood
towards
each
other
during
this
war
could
not
be
removed
by
its
termination
the
saxon
now
first
felt
with
true
bitterness
the
wounds
which
the
upstart
prussian
had
inflicted
upon
him
political
peace
could
not
immediately
a
peace
between
their
dispositions
but
this
was
to
be
brought
about
symbolically
by
the
drama
the
grace
and
amiability
of
the
saxon
ladies
conquer
the
worth
the
dignity
and
the
stubbornness
of
the
prussians
and
in
the
principal
as
well
as
in
the
subordinate
characters
a
happy
union
of
bizarre
and
contradictory
elements
is
artistically
represented
if
i
have
put
my
reader
in
some
perplexity
by
these
cursory
and
desultory
remarks
on
german
literature
i
have
succeeded
in
giving
them
a
conception
of
that
chaotic
condition
in
which
my
poor
brain
found
itself
when
in
the
conflict
of
two
epochs
so
important
for
the
literary
fatherland
so
much
that
was
new
crowded
in
upon
me
before
i
could
come
to
terms
with
the
old
so
much
that
was
old
yet
made
me
feel
its
right
over
me
when
i
believed
i
had
already
cause
to
venture
on
renouncing
it
altogether
i
will
at
present
try
to
impart
as
well
as
possible
the
way
i
entered
on
to
extricate
myself
from
this
difficulty
if
only
step
by
step
goethe
peculiar
tendency
the
period
of
prolixity
into
which
my
youth
had
fallen
i
had
laboured
through
with
genuine
industry
in
company
with
so
many
worthy
men
the
numerous
quarto
volumes
of
manuscript
which
i
left
behind
with
my
father
might
serve
for
sufficient
witnesses
of
this
and
what
a
mass
of
essays
rough
draughts
and
designs
had
more
from
despondency
than
conviction
gone
up
in
smoke
now
through
conversation
through
instruction
in
general
through
so
many
conflicting
opinions
but
especially
through
my
hofrath
pfeil
i
learned
to
value
more
and
more
the
importance
of
the
and
the
conciseness
of
the
treatment
without
however
being
able
to
make
it
clear
to
myself
where
the
former
was
to
be
sought
or
how
the
latter
was
to
be
attained
for
what
with
the
great
narrowness
of
my
situation
what
with
the
indifference
of
my
companions
the
reserve
of
the
professors
the
exclusiveness
of
the
educated
inhabitants
and
what
with
the
perfect
insignificance
of
the
natural
objects
i
was
compelled
to
seek
for
everything
within
myself
if
i
now
desired
a
true
basis
in
feeling
or
reflection
for
my
poems
i
was
forced
to
grasp
into
my
own
bosom
if
i
required
for
my
poetic
representation
an
immediate
intuition
of
an
object
or
an
event
i
could
not
step
outside
the
circle
which
was
fitted
to
teach
me
and
inspire
me
with
an
interest
in
this
view
i
wrote
at
first
certain
little
poems
in
the
form
of
songs
or
in
a
freer
measure
they
are
founded
on
reflection
treat
of
the
past
and
for
the
most
part
take
an
epigrammatic
turn
and
thus
began
that
tendency
from
which
i
could
not
deviate
my
whole
life
through
namely
the
tendency
to
turn
into
an
image
into
a
poem
everything
that
delighted
or
troubled
me
or
otherwise
occupied
me
and
to
come
to
some
certain
understanding
with
myself
upon
it
that
i
might
both
rectify
my
conceptions
of
external
things
and
set
my
mind
at
rest
about
them
the
faculty
of
doing
this
was
necessary
to
no
one
more
than
to
me
for
my
natural
disposition
whirled
me
constantly
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
all
therefore
that
has
been
confessed
by
me
consists
of
fragments
of
a
great
confession
and
this
little
book
is
an
attempt
which
i
have
ventured
on
to
render
it
complete
my
early
affection
for
gretchen
i
had
now
transferred
to
one
annette
of
whom
i
can
say
nothing
more
than
that
she
was
young
handsome
sprightly
loving
and
so
agreeable
that
she
well
deserved
to
be
set
up
for
a
time
in
the
shrine
of
the
heart
as
a
little
saint
that
she
might
receive
all
that
reverence
which
it
often
causes
more
pleasure
to
bestow
than
to
receive
i
saw
her
daily
without
hindrance
she
helped
to
prepare
the
meals
which
i
enjoyed
she
brought
in
the
evening
at
least
the
wine
which
i
drank
and
indeed
our
select
club
of
boarders
was
a
warranty
that
the
little
house
which
was
visited
by
few
guests
except
during
the
fair
well
merited
its
good
reputation
opportunity
and
inclination
were
found
for
various
kinds
of
amusement
but
as
she
neither
could
nor
dared
go
much
out
of
the
house
the
pastime
was
somewhat
limited
we
sang
the
songs
of
zachariä
played
the
of
krüger
in
which
a
knotted
handkerchief
had
to
take
the
place
of
the
nightingale
and
so
for
a
while
it
went
on
quite
tolerably
but
since
such
connexions
the
more
innocent
they
are
afford
the
less
variety
in
the
long
run
so
was
i
seized
with
that
wicked
distemper
which
seduces
us
to
derive
amusement
from
the
torment
of
a
beloved
one
and
to
domineer
over
a
girl
devotedness
with
wanton
and
tyrannical
caprice
my
at
the
failure
of
my
poetical
attempts
at
the
apparent
impossibility
of
coming
to
a
clear
understanding
about
them
and
at
everything
else
that
might
pinch
me
here
and
there
i
thought
i
might
vent
on
her
because
she
truly
loved
me
with
all
her
heart
and
did
whatever
she
could
to
please
me
by
unfounded
and
absurd
fits
of
jealousy
i
destroyed
our
most
delightful
days
both
for
myself
and
her
she
endured
it
for
a
time
with
incredible
patience
which
i
was
cruel
enough
to
try
to
the
uttermost
but
to
my
shame
and
despair
i
was
at
last
forced
to
remark
that
her
heart
was
alienated
from
me
and
that
i
might
now
have
good
ground
for
the
madness
in
which
i
had
indulged
without
necessity
and
without
cause
there
were
also
terrible
scenes
between
us
in
which
i
gained
nothing
and
i
then
first
felt
that
i
had
truly
loved
her
and
could
not
bear
to
lose
her
my
passion
grew
and
assumed
all
the
forms
of
which
it
is
capable
under
such
circumstances
nay
at
last
i
even
took
up
the
which
the
girl
had
hitherto
played
i
sought
everything
possible
in
order
to
be
agreeable
to
her
even
to
procure
her
pleasure
by
means
of
others
for
i
could
not
renounce
the
hope
of
winning
her
again
but
it
was
too
late
i
had
lost
her
really
and
the
frenzy
with
which
i
revenged
my
fault
upon
myself
by
assaulting
in
various
frantic
ways
my
physical
nature
in
order
to
inflict
some
hurt
on
my
moral
nature
contributed
very
much
to
the
bodily
maladies
under
which
i
lost
some
of
the
best
years
of
my
life
indeed
i
should
perchance
have
been
completely
ruined
by
this
loss
had
not
my
poetic
talent
here
shown
itself
particularly
helpful
with
its
healing
power
die
laune
des
verliebten
already
at
many
intervals
before
i
had
clearly
enough
perceived
my
i
really
pitied
the
poor
child
when
i
saw
her
so
thoroughly
wounded
by
me
without
necessity
i
pictured
to
myself
so
often
and
so
circumstantially
her
condition
and
my
own
and
as
a
contrast
the
contented
state
of
another
couple
in
our
company
that
at
last
i
could
not
forbear
treating
this
situation
dramatically
as
a
painful
and
instructive
penance
hence
arose
the
oldest
of
my
extant
dramatic
labours
the
little
piece
entitled
laune
des
lover
in
the
simple
nature
of
which
one
may
at
the
same
time
perceive
the
impetus
of
a
boiling
passion
but
before
this
a
deep
significant
impulsive
world
had
already
interested
me
through
my
adventure
with
gretchen
and
its
consequences
i
had
early
looked
into
the
strange
labyrinths
by
which
civil
society
is
undermined
religion
morals
law
rank
connexions
custom
all
rule
only
the
surface
of
city
existence
the
streets
bordered
by
splendid
houses
are
kept
neat
and
every
one
behaves
himself
there
properly
enough
but
indoors
it
often
seems
only
so
much
the
more
disordered
and
a
smooth
exterior
like
a
thin
coat
of
mortar
plasters
over
many
a
rotten
wall
that
tumbles
together
overnight
and
produces
an
effect
the
more
frightful
as
it
comes
into
the
midst
of
a
condition
of
repose
how
many
families
far
and
near
had
i
not
already
seen
either
overwhelmed
in
ruin
or
kept
miserably
hanging
on
the
brink
of
it
by
means
of
bankruptcies
divorces
seduced
daughters
murders
poisonings
and
young
as
i
was
i
had
often
in
such
cases
lent
a
hand
for
help
and
preservation
for
as
my
frankness
awakened
confidence
as
my
secresy
was
proved
as
my
activity
feared
no
sacrifice
and
loved
best
to
exert
itself
in
the
most
dangerous
affairs
i
had
often
enough
found
opportunity
to
mediate
to
hush
up
to
divert
the
with
every
other
assistance
of
the
kind
in
the
course
of
which
as
well
in
my
own
person
as
through
others
i
could
not
fail
to
come
to
the
knowledge
of
many
afflicting
and
humiliating
facts
to
relieve
myself
i
designed
several
plays
and
wrote
the
arguments
of
most
of
them
but
since
the
intrigues
were
always
obliged
to
be
painful
and
almost
all
these
pieces
threatened
a
tragical
conclusion
i
let
them
drop
one
after
another
is
the
only
one
that
was
finished
the
cheerful
and
burlesque
tone
of
which
upon
the
gloomy
appears
as
if
accompanied
by
somewhat
of
apprehension
so
that
on
the
whole
it
is
painful
in
representation
although
it
pleases
in
detached
passages
the
illegal
deeds
harshly
expressed
wound
the
æsthetic
and
moral
feeling
and
the
piece
could
therefore
find
no
favour
on
the
german
stage
although
the
imitations
of
it
which
steered
clear
of
those
rocks
were
received
with
applause
both
the
pieces
were
however
written
from
a
more
elevated
point
of
view
without
my
having
been
aware
of
it
they
direct
us
to
a
considerate
forbearance
in
casting
moral
imputations
and
in
somewhat
harsh
and
coarse
touches
sportively
express
that
most
christian
maxim
him
who
is
without
sin
among
you
cast
the
first
youthful
pranks
through
this
earnestness
which
cast
a
gloom
over
my
first
pieces
i
committed
the
fault
of
neglecting
very
favourable
materials
which
lay
quite
decidedly
in
my
natural
disposition
in
the
midst
of
these
serious
and
for
a
young
man
fearful
experiences
was
developed
in
me
a
reckless
humour
which
feels
itself
superior
to
the
moment
and
not
only
fears
no
danger
but
rather
wantonly
courts
it
the
ground
of
this
lay
in
the
exuberance
of
spirits
in
which
the
vigorous
time
of
life
so
much
delights
and
which
if
it
manifests
itself
in
a
frolicsome
way
causes
much
pleasure
both
at
the
moment
and
in
remembrance
these
things
are
so
usual
that
in
the
vocabulary
of
our
young
university
friends
they
are
called
and
on
account
of
the
close
similarity
of
signification
to
say
means
just
the
same
as
to
play
pranks
such
humorous
acts
of
daring
brought
on
the
theatre
with
wit
and
sense
are
of
the
greatest
effect
they
are
distinguished
from
intrigue
inasmuch
as
they
are
momentary
and
that
their
aim
whenever
they
are
to
have
one
must
not
be
remote
beaumarchais
has
seized
their
full
value
and
the
effects
of
his
spring
from
this
if
now
such
roguish
and
pranks
are
practised
with
personal
risk
for
noble
ends
the
situations
which
arise
from
them
are
æsthetically
and
morally
considered
of
the
greatest
value
for
the
theatre
as
for
instance
the
opera
of
the
treats
perhaps
the
happiest
subject
which
we
have
ever
yet
seen
upon
the
stage
to
enliven
the
endless
tedium
of
daily
life
i
played
off
numberless
tricks
of
the
sort
partly
without
any
aim
at
all
partly
in
the
service
of
my
friends
whom
i
liked
to
please
for
myself
i
could
not
say
that
i
had
once
acted
in
this
designedly
nor
did
i
ever
happen
to
consider
a
feat
of
the
kind
as
a
subject
for
art
had
i
however
seized
upon
and
elaborated
such
materials
which
were
so
close
at
hand
my
earliest
labours
would
have
been
more
cheerful
and
available
some
incidents
of
this
kind
occur
indeed
later
but
isolated
and
without
design
for
since
the
heart
always
lies
nearer
to
us
than
the
head
and
gives
us
trouble
when
the
latter
knows
well
how
to
help
itself
so
the
affairs
of
the
heart
had
always
appeared
to
me
as
the
most
important
i
was
never
weary
of
reflecting
upon
the
transient
nature
of
attachments
the
mutability
of
human
character
moral
sensuality
and
all
the
heights
and
depths
the
combination
of
which
in
our
nature
may
be
considered
as
the
riddle
of
human
life
here
too
i
sought
to
get
rid
of
that
which
troubled
me
in
a
song
an
epigram
in
some
kind
of
rhyme
which
since
they
referred
to
the
most
private
feelings
and
the
most
peculiar
circumstances
could
scarcely
interest
any
one
but
myself
in
the
meanwhile
my
external
position
had
very
much
changed
after
the
lapse
of
a
short
time
madame
böhme
after
a
long
and
melancholy
illness
had
at
last
died
she
had
latterly
ceased
to
admit
me
to
her
presence
her
husband
could
not
be
particularly
satisfied
with
me
i
seemed
to
him
not
sufficiently
industrious
and
too
frivolous
he
especially
took
it
very
ill
of
me
when
it
was
told
him
that
at
the
lectures
on
german
public
law
instead
of
taking
proper
notes
i
had
been
drawing
on
the
margin
of
my
the
personages
presented
to
our
notice
in
them
such
as
the
president
of
the
chamber
the
moderators
and
assessors
in
strange
wigs
and
by
this
drollery
had
disturbed
my
attentive
neighbours
and
set
them
laughing
after
the
loss
of
his
wife
he
lived
still
more
retired
than
before
and
at
last
i
shunned
him
in
order
to
avoid
his
reproaches
but
it
was
peculiarly
unfortunate
that
gellert
would
not
use
the
power
which
he
might
have
exercised
over
us
indeed
he
had
not
time
to
play
the
and
to
inquire
after
the
character
and
faults
of
everybody
he
therefore
took
the
matter
very
much
in
the
lump
and
thought
to
curb
us
by
means
of
the
church
forms
for
this
reason
commonly
when
he
once
admitted
us
to
his
presence
he
used
to
lower
his
little
head
and
in
his
weeping
winning
voice
to
ask
us
whether
we
went
regularly
to
church
who
was
our
confessor
and
whether
we
took
the
holy
communion
if
now
we
came
off
badly
at
this
examination
we
were
dismissed
with
lamentations
we
were
more
vexed
than
edified
yet
could
not
help
loving
the
man
heartily
sacraments
of
the
church
on
this
occasion
i
can
not
forbear
recalling
somewhat
of
my
earlier
youth
in
order
to
make
it
obvious
that
the
great
affairs
of
the
ecclesiastical
religion
must
be
carried
on
with
order
and
coherence
if
they
are
to
prove
as
fruitful
as
is
expected
the
protestant
service
has
too
little
fulness
and
consistency
to
be
able
to
hold
the
congregation
together
hence
it
easily
happens
that
members
secede
from
it
and
either
form
little
congregations
of
their
own
or
without
ecclesiastical
connexion
quietly
carry
on
their
side
by
side
thus
for
a
considerable
time
complaints
were
made
that
the
were
diminishing
from
year
to
year
and
just
in
the
same
ratio
the
persons
who
partook
of
the
lord
supper
with
respect
to
both
but
especially
the
latter
the
cause
lies
close
at
hand
but
who
dares
to
speak
it
out
we
will
make
the
attempt
in
moral
and
religious
as
well
as
in
physical
and
civil
matters
man
does
not
like
to
do
anything
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
needs
a
sequence
from
which
results
habit
what
he
is
to
love
and
to
perform
he
can
not
represent
to
himself
as
single
or
isolated
and
if
he
is
to
repeat
anything
willingly
it
must
not
have
become
strange
to
him
if
the
protestant
worship
lacks
fulness
in
general
so
let
it
be
investigated
in
detail
and
it
will
be
found
that
the
protestant
has
too
few
sacraments
nay
indeed
he
has
only
one
in
which
he
is
himself
an
actor
the
lord
supper
for
baptism
he
sees
only
when
it
is
performed
on
others
and
is
not
greatly
edified
by
it
the
sacraments
are
the
highest
part
of
religion
the
symbols
to
our
senses
of
an
extraordinary
divine
favour
and
grace
in
the
lord
supper
earthly
lips
are
to
receive
a
divine
being
embodied
and
partake
of
an
heavenly
under
the
form
of
an
earthly
nourishment
this
sense
is
just
the
same
in
all
christian
churches
whether
the
sacrament
is
taken
with
more
or
less
submission
to
the
mystery
with
more
or
less
accommodation
as
to
that
which
is
intelligible
it
always
remains
a
great
holy
thing
which
in
reality
takes
the
place
of
the
possible
or
the
impossible
the
place
of
that
which
man
can
neither
attain
nor
do
without
but
such
a
sacrament
should
not
stand
alone
no
christian
can
partake
of
it
with
the
true
joy
for
which
it
is
given
if
the
symbolical
or
sacramental
sense
is
not
fostered
within
him
he
must
be
accustomed
to
regard
the
inner
religion
of
the
heart
and
that
of
the
external
church
as
perfectly
one
as
the
great
universal
sacrament
which
again
divides
itself
into
so
many
others
and
communicates
to
these
parts
its
holiness
indestructibleness
and
eternity
here
a
youthful
pair
give
their
hands
to
one
another
not
for
a
passing
salutation
or
for
the
dance
the
priest
pronounces
his
blessing
upon
them
and
the
bond
is
indissoluble
it
is
not
long
before
this
wedded
pair
bring
a
likeness
to
the
threshold
of
the
altar
it
is
purified
with
holy
water
and
so
incorporated
into
the
church
that
it
can
not
forfeit
this
benefit
but
through
the
most
monstrous
apostacy
the
child
in
the
course
of
life
practises
himself
in
earthly
things
of
his
own
accord
in
heavenly
things
he
must
be
instructed
does
it
prove
on
examination
that
this
has
been
fully
done
he
is
now
received
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
as
an
actual
citizen
as
a
true
and
voluntary
professor
not
without
outward
tokens
of
the
weightiness
of
this
act
now
is
he
first
decidedly
a
christian
now
for
the
first
time
he
knows
his
advantages
and
also
his
duties
but
in
the
meanwhile
much
that
is
strange
has
happened
to
him
as
a
man
through
instruction
and
affliction
he
has
come
to
know
how
critical
appears
the
state
of
his
inner
self
and
there
will
constantly
be
a
question
of
doctrines
and
of
transgressions
but
punishment
shall
no
longer
take
place
for
here
in
the
infinite
confusion
in
which
he
must
entangle
himself
amid
the
conflict
of
natural
and
religious
claims
an
admirable
expedient
is
given
him
in
confiding
his
deeds
and
misdeeds
his
infirmities
and
doubts
to
a
worthy
man
appointed
expressly
for
that
purpose
who
knows
how
to
calm
to
warn
to
strengthen
him
to
chasten
him
likewise
by
symbolical
punishments
and
at
last
by
a
complete
washing
away
of
his
guilt
to
render
him
happy
and
to
give
him
back
pure
and
cleansed
the
tablet
of
his
manhood
thus
prepared
and
purely
calmed
to
rest
by
several
sacramental
acts
which
on
closer
examination
branch
forth
again
into
minuter
sacramental
traits
he
kneels
down
to
receive
the
host
and
that
the
mystery
of
this
high
act
may
be
still
enhanced
he
sees
the
chalice
only
in
the
distance
it
is
no
common
eating
and
drinking
that
satisfies
it
is
a
heavenly
feast
which
makes
him
thirst
after
heavenly
drink
yet
let
not
the
youth
believe
that
this
is
all
he
has
to
do
let
not
even
the
man
believe
it
in
earthly
relations
we
are
at
last
accustomed
to
depend
on
ourselves
and
even
there
knowledge
understanding
and
character
will
not
always
suffice
in
heavenly
things
on
the
contrary
we
have
never
finished
learning
the
higher
feeling
within
us
which
often
finds
itself
not
even
truly
at
home
is
besides
oppressed
by
so
much
from
without
that
our
own
power
hardly
administers
all
that
is
necessary
for
counsel
consolation
and
help
but
to
this
end
that
remedy
is
instituted
for
our
whole
life
and
an
intelligent
pious
man
is
continually
waiting
to
show
the
right
way
to
the
wanderers
and
to
relieve
the
distressed
catholic
sacraments
and
what
has
been
so
well
tried
through
the
whole
life
is
now
to
show
forth
all
its
healing
power
with
tenfold
activity
at
the
gate
of
death
according
to
a
trustful
custom
inculcated
from
youth
upwards
the
dying
man
receives
with
fervour
those
symbolical
significant
assurances
and
there
where
every
earthly
warranty
fails
he
is
assured
by
a
heavenly
one
of
a
blessed
existence
for
all
eternity
he
feels
himself
perfectly
convinced
that
neither
a
hostile
element
nor
a
malignant
spirit
can
hinder
him
from
clothing
himself
with
a
glorified
body
so
that
in
immediate
relation
with
the
godhead
he
may
partake
of
the
boundless
happiness
which
flows
forth
from
him
then
in
conclusion
that
the
whole
may
be
made
holy
the
feet
also
are
anointed
and
blessed
they
are
to
feel
even
in
the
event
of
possible
recovery
a
repugnance
to
touching
this
earthly
hard
impenetrable
soil
a
wonderful
nimbleness
is
to
be
imparted
to
them
by
which
they
spurn
from
under
them
the
clod
of
earth
which
hitherto
attracted
them
and
so
through
a
brilliant
circle
of
equally
holy
acts
the
beauty
of
which
we
have
only
briefly
hinted
at
the
cradle
and
the
grave
however
far
asunder
they
may
chance
to
be
are
bound
in
one
continuous
circle
but
all
these
spiritual
wonders
spring
not
like
other
fruits
from
the
natural
soil
where
they
can
neither
be
sown
nor
planted
nor
cherished
we
must
supplicate
for
them
from
another
region
a
thing
which
can
not
be
done
by
all
persons
nor
at
all
times
here
we
meet
the
highest
of
these
symbols
derived
from
pious
tradition
we
are
told
that
one
man
can
be
more
favoured
blessed
and
sanctified
from
above
than
another
but
that
this
may
not
appear
as
a
natural
gift
this
great
boon
bound
up
with
a
heavy
duty
must
be
communicated
to
others
by
one
authorized
person
to
another
and
the
greatest
good
that
a
man
can
attain
without
his
having
to
obtain
it
by
his
own
wrestling
or
grasping
must
be
preserved
and
perpetuated
on
earth
by
spiritual
heirship
in
the
very
ordination
of
the
priest
is
comprehended
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
effectual
solemnizing
of
those
holy
acts
by
which
the
multitude
receive
grace
without
any
other
activity
being
needful
on
their
part
than
that
of
faith
and
implicit
confidence
and
thus
the
priest
steps
forth
in
the
line
of
his
predecessors
and
successors
in
the
circle
of
those
anointed
with
him
representing
the
highest
source
of
blessings
so
much
the
more
gloriously
as
it
is
not
he
the
priest
whom
we
reverence
but
his
office
it
is
not
his
nod
to
which
we
bow
the
knee
but
the
blessing
which
he
imparts
and
which
seems
the
more
holy
and
to
come
the
more
immediately
from
heaven
because
the
earthly
instrument
can
not
at
all
weaken
or
invalidate
it
by
its
own
sinful
nay
wicked
nature
how
is
this
truly
spiritual
connexion
shattered
to
pieces
in
protestantism
by
part
of
the
symbols
being
declared
apocryphal
and
only
a
few
canonical
and
how
by
their
indifference
to
one
of
these
will
they
prepare
us
for
the
high
dignity
of
the
others
in
my
time
i
had
been
confided
to
the
religious
instruction
of
a
good
old
infirm
clergyman
who
had
been
confessor
of
the
family
for
many
years
the
a
of
it
and
the
of
i
had
at
my
fingers
ends
i
lacked
not
one
of
the
strongly
proving
biblical
texts
but
from
all
this
i
reaped
no
fruit
for
as
they
assured
me
that
the
honest
old
man
arranged
his
chief
examination
according
to
an
old
set
form
i
lost
all
pleasure
and
inclination
for
the
business
spent
the
last
week
in
all
sorts
of
diversions
laid
in
my
hat
the
loose
leaves
borrowed
from
an
older
friend
who
had
gotten
them
from
the
clergyman
and
unfeelingly
and
senselessly
read
aloud
all
that
i
should
have
known
how
to
utter
with
feeling
and
conviction
religious
apprehensions
but
i
found
my
and
my
aspirations
in
this
important
matter
still
more
paralyzed
by
a
dry
spiritless
routine
when
i
was
now
to
approach
the
confessional
i
was
indeed
conscious
to
myself
of
many
failings
but
of
no
great
faults
and
that
very
consciousness
diminished
them
since
it
directed
me
to
the
moral
strength
which
lay
within
me
and
which
with
resolution
and
perseverance
was
at
last
to
become
master
over
the
old
adam
we
were
taught
that
we
were
much
better
than
the
catholics
for
this
very
reason
that
we
were
not
obliged
to
acknowledge
anything
in
particular
in
the
confessional
nay
that
this
would
not
be
at
all
proper
even
if
we
wished
to
do
it
this
last
did
not
seem
right
to
me
for
i
had
the
strangest
religious
doubts
which
i
would
readily
have
had
cleared
up
on
such
an
occasion
now
as
this
was
not
to
be
done
i
composed
a
confession
for
myself
which
while
it
well
expressed
my
state
of
mind
was
to
confess
to
an
intelligent
man
in
general
terms
that
which
i
was
forbidden
to
tell
him
in
detail
but
when
i
entered
the
old
choir
of
the
barefoot
friars
when
i
approached
the
strange
latticed
closets
in
which
the
reverend
gentlemen
used
to
be
found
for
that
purpose
when
the
sexton
opened
the
door
for
me
when
i
now
saw
myself
shut
up
in
the
narrow
place
face
to
face
with
my
spiritual
grandsire
and
he
bade
me
welcome
with
his
weak
nasal
voice
all
the
light
of
my
mind
and
heart
was
extinguished
at
once
the
would
not
cross
my
lips
i
opened
in
my
embarrassment
the
book
which
i
had
in
hand
and
read
from
it
the
first
short
form
i
saw
which
was
so
general
that
anybody
might
have
spoken
it
with
quite
a
safe
conscience
i
received
absolution
and
withdrew
neither
warm
nor
cold
went
the
next
day
with
my
parents
to
the
table
of
the
lord
and
for
a
few
days
behaved
myself
as
was
becoming
after
so
holy
an
act
in
the
sequel
however
there
came
over
me
that
evil
which
from
the
fact
of
our
religion
being
complicated
by
various
dogmas
and
founded
on
texts
of
scripture
which
admit
of
several
interpretations
attacks
scrupulous
men
in
such
a
manner
that
it
brings
on
a
hypochondriacal
condition
and
raises
this
to
its
highest
point
to
fixed
ideas
i
have
known
several
men
who
though
their
manner
of
thinking
and
living
was
perfectly
rational
could
not
free
themselves
from
thinking
about
the
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
and
from
the
fear
that
they
had
committed
it
a
similar
trouble
threatened
me
on
the
subject
of
the
communion
for
the
text
that
one
who
unworthily
partakes
of
the
sacrament
and
drinketh
damnation
to
had
very
early
already
made
a
monstrous
impression
upon
me
every
fearful
thing
that
i
had
read
in
the
histories
of
the
middle
ages
of
the
judgments
of
god
of
those
most
strange
ordeals
by
iron
flaming
fire
swelling
water
and
even
what
the
bible
tells
us
of
the
draught
which
agrees
well
with
the
innocent
but
puffs
up
and
bursts
the
guilty
all
this
pictured
itself
to
my
imagination
and
formed
itself
into
the
most
frightful
combinations
since
false
vows
hypocrisy
perjury
blasphemy
all
seemed
to
weigh
down
the
unworthy
person
at
this
most
holy
act
which
was
so
much
the
more
horrible
as
no
one
could
dare
to
pronounce
himself
worthy
and
the
forgiveness
of
sins
by
which
everything
was
to
be
at
last
done
away
was
found
limited
by
so
many
conditions
that
one
could
not
with
certainty
dare
appropriate
it
to
oneself
this
gloomy
scruple
troubled
me
to
such
a
degree
and
the
expedient
which
they
would
represent
to
me
as
sufficient
seemed
so
bald
and
feeble
that
it
gave
the
bugbear
only
a
more
fearful
aspect
and
as
soon
as
i
had
reached
leipzig
i
tried
to
free
myself
altogether
from
my
connexion
with
the
church
how
oppressive
then
must
have
been
to
me
the
exhortations
of
gellert
whom
considering
the
generally
laconic
style
with
which
he
was
obliged
to
repel
our
obtrusiveness
i
was
unwilling
to
trouble
with
such
singular
questions
and
the
less
so
as
in
my
more
cheerful
hours
i
was
myself
ashamed
of
them
and
at
last
left
completely
behind
me
this
strange
anguish
of
conscience
together
with
church
and
altar
decline
of
gellert
authority
gellert
in
accordance
with
his
pious
feelings
had
composed
for
himself
a
course
of
ethics
which
from
time
to
time
he
publicly
read
and
thus
in
an
honourable
manner
acquitted
himself
of
his
duty
to
the
public
gellert
writings
had
already
for
a
long
time
been
the
foundation
of
german
moral
culture
and
every
one
anxiously
wished
to
see
that
work
printed
but
as
this
was
not
to
be
done
till
after
the
good
man
death
people
thought
themselves
very
fortunate
to
hear
him
deliver
it
himself
in
his
lifetime
the
philosophical
auditorium
was
at
such
times
crowded
and
the
beautiful
soul
the
pure
will
and
the
interest
of
the
noble
man
in
our
welfare
his
exhortations
warnings
and
entreaties
uttered
in
a
somewhat
hollow
and
sorrowful
tone
made
indeed
an
impression
for
the
moment
but
this
did
not
last
long
the
less
so
as
there
were
many
scoffers
who
contrived
to
make
us
suspicious
of
this
tender
and
as
they
thought
enervating
manner
i
remember
a
frenchman
travelling
through
the
town
who
inquired
after
the
maxims
and
opinions
of
the
man
who
attracted
such
an
immense
concourse
when
we
had
given
him
the
necessary
information
he
shook
his
head
and
said
smiling
le
faire
il
nous
forme
des
and
thus
also
did
good
society
which
can
not
easily
endure
anything
estimable
in
its
neighbourhood
know
how
to
spoil
on
occasion
the
moral
influence
which
gellert
might
have
had
upon
us
now
it
was
taken
ill
of
him
that
he
instructed
the
danes
of
distinction
and
wealth
who
were
particularly
recommended
to
him
better
than
the
other
students
and
had
a
marked
solicitude
for
them
now
he
was
charged
with
selfishness
and
nepotism
for
causing
a
table
to
be
established
for
these
young
men
at
his
brother
house
this
brother
a
tall
blunt
unceremonious
and
somewhat
rude
man
had
it
was
said
been
a
and
notwithstanding
the
too
great
lenity
of
his
brother
the
noble
boarders
were
often
treated
harshly
and
roughly
hence
the
people
thought
they
must
again
take
the
part
of
these
young
folks
and
pulled
about
the
good
reputation
of
the
excellent
gellert
to
such
a
degree
that
in
order
not
to
be
mistaken
about
him
we
became
indifferent
towards
him
and
visited
him
no
more
yet
we
always
saluted
him
in
our
best
manner
when
he
came
riding
along
on
his
tame
grey
horse
this
horse
the
elector
had
sent
him
to
oblige
him
to
take
an
exercise
so
necessary
for
his
health
a
distinction
which
was
not
easily
forgiven
him
and
thus
by
degrees
the
epoch
approached
when
all
authority
was
to
vanish
from
before
me
and
i
was
to
become
suspicious
nay
to
despair
even
of
the
greatest
and
best
individuals
whom
i
had
known
or
imagined
frederick
the
second
still
stood
at
the
head
of
all
the
distinguished
men
of
the
century
in
my
thoughts
and
it
must
therefore
have
appeared
very
surprising
to
me
that
i
could
praise
him
as
little
before
the
inhabitants
of
leipzig
as
formerly
in
my
grandfather
house
they
had
felt
the
hand
of
war
heavily
it
is
true
and
therefore
they
were
not
to
blame
for
not
thinking
the
best
of
him
who
had
begun
and
continued
it
they
therefore
were
willing
to
let
him
pass
as
a
distinguished
but
by
no
means
as
a
great
man
there
was
no
art
they
said
in
performing
something
with
great
means
and
if
one
spares
neither
lands
nor
money
nor
blood
one
may
well
accomplish
one
purpose
at
last
frederick
had
shown
himself
great
in
none
of
his
plans
and
in
nothing
that
he
had
properly
speaking
undertaken
so
long
as
it
depended
on
himself
he
had
only
gone
on
making
blunders
and
what
was
extraordinary
in
him
had
only
come
to
light
when
he
was
compelled
to
make
these
blunders
good
again
it
was
purely
from
this
that
he
had
obtained
his
great
reputation
since
every
man
wishes
for
himself
that
same
talent
of
making
good
in
a
clever
way
the
blunders
which
he
frequently
commits
if
one
goes
through
the
seven
years
war
step
by
step
it
will
be
found
that
the
king
quite
uselessly
sacrificed
his
fine
army
and
that
it
was
his
own
fault
that
this
ruinous
feud
had
been
protracted
to
so
great
a
length
a
truly
great
man
and
general
would
have
got
the
better
of
his
enemies
much
sooner
in
support
of
these
opinions
they
could
cite
infinite
details
which
i
did
not
know
how
to
deny
and
i
felt
the
unbounded
reverence
which
i
had
devoted
to
this
remarkable
prince
from
my
youth
upwards
gradually
cooling
away
behrisch
as
the
inhabitants
of
leipzig
had
now
destroyed
for
me
the
pleasant
feeling
of
revering
a
great
man
so
did
a
new
friend
whom
i
gained
at
the
time
very
much
diminish
the
respect
which
i
entertained
for
my
present
this
friend
was
one
of
the
strangest
fellows
in
the
world
he
was
named
behrisch
and
was
tutor
to
the
young
count
lindenau
even
his
exterior
was
singular
enough
lean
and
far
advanced
in
the
thirties
a
very
large
nose
and
altogether
marked
features
he
wore
from
morning
till
night
a
scratch
which
might
well
have
been
called
a
peruke
but
dressed
himself
very
neatly
and
never
went
out
but
with
his
sword
by
his
side
and
his
hat
under
his
arm
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
have
quite
a
peculiar
gift
of
killing
time
or
rather
who
know
how
to
make
something
out
of
nothing
in
order
to
pass
time
away
everything
that
he
did
must
be
done
with
slowness
and
a
certain
deportment
which
might
have
been
called
affected
if
behrisch
had
not
even
by
nature
had
something
affected
in
his
manner
he
resembled
an
old
frenchman
and
also
spoke
and
wrote
french
very
well
and
easily
his
greatest
delight
was
to
busy
himself
seriously
about
drolleries
and
to
follow
up
without
end
any
silly
notion
thus
he
was
constantly
dressed
in
grey
and
as
the
different
parts
of
his
attire
were
of
different
stuffs
and
also
of
different
shades
he
could
reflect
for
whole
days
as
to
how
he
should
procure
one
grey
more
for
his
body
and
was
happy
when
he
had
succeeded
in
this
and
could
put
to
shame
us
who
had
doubted
it
or
had
pronounced
it
impossible
he
then
gave
us
long
severe
lectures
about
our
lack
of
inventive
power
and
our
want
of
faith
in
his
talents
for
the
rest
he
had
studied
well
was
particularly
versed
in
the
modern
languages
and
their
literature
and
wrote
an
excellent
hand
he
was
very
well
disposed
to
me
and
i
having
been
always
accustomed
and
inclined
to
the
society
of
older
persons
soon
attached
myself
to
him
my
intercourse
too
served
him
for
a
special
amusement
since
he
took
pleasure
in
taming
my
restlessness
and
impatience
with
which
on
the
other
hand
i
gave
him
enough
to
do
in
the
art
of
poetry
he
had
what
is
called
taste
a
certain
general
opinion
about
the
good
and
bad
the
mediocre
and
tolerable
but
his
judgment
was
rather
censorious
and
he
destroyed
even
the
little
faith
in
contemporary
writers
which
i
cherished
within
me
by
unfeeling
remarks
which
he
knew
how
to
advance
with
wit
and
humour
about
the
writings
and
poems
of
this
man
and
that
he
received
my
own
affairs
with
indulgence
and
let
me
have
my
way
but
only
on
the
condition
that
i
should
have
nothing
printed
he
promised
me
on
the
other
hand
that
he
himself
would
copy
those
pieces
which
he
thought
good
and
would
present
me
with
them
in
a
handsome
volume
this
undertaking
now
afforded
an
opportunity
for
the
greatest
possible
waste
of
time
for
before
he
could
find
the
right
paper
before
he
could
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
size
before
he
had
settled
the
breadth
of
the
margin
and
the
form
of
handwriting
before
the
were
provided
and
cut
into
pens
and
indian
ink
was
rubbed
whole
weeks
passed
without
the
least
bit
having
been
done
with
just
as
much
ado
he
always
set
about
his
writing
and
really
by
degrees
put
together
a
most
charming
manuscript
the
title
of
the
poems
was
in
german
text
the
verses
themselves
in
a
perpendicular
saxon
hand
and
at
the
end
of
every
poem
was
an
analogous
vignette
which
he
had
either
selected
somewhere
or
other
or
had
invented
himself
and
in
which
he
contrived
to
imitate
very
neatly
the
hatching
of
the
and
which
are
used
for
such
purposes
to
show
me
these
things
as
he
went
on
to
celebrate
beforehand
in
a
manner
my
good
fortune
in
seeing
myself
immortalized
in
such
exquisite
handwriting
and
that
in
a
style
which
no
could
attain
gave
another
occasion
for
passing
the
most
agreeable
hours
in
the
meantime
his
intercourse
was
always
secretly
instructive
by
reason
of
his
liberal
acquirements
and
as
he
knew
how
to
subdue
my
restless
impetuous
disposition
was
also
quite
wholesome
for
me
in
a
moral
sense
he
had
too
quite
a
peculiar
abhorrence
of
roughness
and
his
jests
were
always
quaint
without
ever
falling
into
the
coarse
or
the
trivial
he
indulged
himself
in
a
distorted
aversion
from
his
countrymen
and
described
with
ludicrous
touches
even
what
they
were
able
to
undertake
he
was
particularly
inexhaustible
in
a
comical
representation
of
individual
persons
as
he
found
something
to
find
fault
with
in
the
exterior
of
every
one
thus
when
we
lay
together
at
the
window
he
could
occupy
himself
for
hours
criticising
the
and
when
he
had
censured
them
long
enough
in
showing
exactly
and
circumstantially
how
they
ought
to
have
dressed
themselves
ought
to
have
walked
and
ought
to
have
behaved
to
look
like
orderly
people
such
attempts
for
the
most
part
ended
in
something
improper
and
absurd
so
that
we
did
not
so
much
laugh
at
how
the
man
looked
but
at
how
perchance
he
might
have
looked
had
he
been
mad
enough
to
caricature
himself
in
all
such
matters
behrisch
went
quite
unmercifully
to
work
without
being
in
the
slightest
degree
malicious
on
the
other
hand
we
knew
how
to
teaze
him
on
our
side
by
assuring
him
that
to
judge
from
his
exterior
he
must
be
taken
if
not
for
a
french
at
least
for
the
academical
teacher
of
the
language
this
reproval
was
usually
the
signal
for
dissertations
an
hour
long
in
which
he
used
to
set
forth
the
difference
wide
as
the
heavens
which
there
was
between
him
and
an
old
frenchman
at
the
same
time
he
commonly
imputed
to
us
all
sorts
of
awkward
attempts
that
we
might
possibly
have
made
for
the
alteration
and
modification
of
his
wardrobe
the
direction
of
my
poetizing
which
i
only
carried
on
the
more
zealously
as
the
transcript
went
on
becoming
more
beautiful
and
more
careful
now
inclined
altogether
to
the
natural
and
the
true
and
if
the
subjects
could
not
always
be
important
i
nevertheless
always
endeavoured
to
express
them
clearly
and
pointedly
the
more
so
as
my
friend
often
gave
me
to
understand
what
a
great
thing
it
was
to
write
down
a
verse
on
dutch
paper
with
the
and
indian
ink
what
time
talent
and
exertion
it
required
which
ought
not
to
be
squandered
on
anything
empty
and
superfluous
at
the
same
time
he
commonly
used
to
open
a
finished
parcel
and
circumstantially
to
explain
what
ought
not
to
stand
in
this
or
that
place
or
congratulate
us
that
it
actually
did
not
stand
there
he
then
spoke
with
great
contempt
of
the
art
of
printing
mimicked
the
compositor
ridiculed
his
gestures
and
his
hurried
picking
out
of
letters
here
and
there
and
derived
from
this
manœuvre
all
the
calamities
of
literature
on
the
other
hand
he
extolled
the
grace
and
the
noble
posture
of
a
writer
and
immediately
sat
down
himself
to
exhibit
it
to
us
while
he
rated
us
at
the
same
time
for
not
demeaning
ourselves
at
the
precisely
after
his
example
and
model
he
now
returned
to
the
contrast
with
the
compositor
turned
a
begun
letter
upside
down
and
showed
how
unseemly
it
would
be
to
write
anything
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
or
from
the
right
to
the
left
with
other
things
of
like
kind
with
which
whole
volumes
might
have
been
filled
with
such
harmless
fooleries
we
lavished
away
our
precious
time
while
it
could
have
occurred
to
none
of
us
that
anything
would
chance
to
proceed
out
of
our
circle
which
would
awaken
a
general
sensation
and
bring
us
into
not
the
best
repute
professor
clodius
gellert
may
have
taken
little
pleasure
in
his
and
if
perhaps
he
took
pleasure
in
giving
some
directions
as
to
prose
and
poetical
style
he
did
it
most
privately
only
to
a
few
among
whom
we
could
not
number
ourselves
professor
clodius
thought
to
fill
the
gap
which
thus
arose
in
the
public
instruction
he
had
gained
some
renown
in
literature
criticism
and
poetry
and
as
a
young
lively
obliging
man
found
many
friends
both
in
the
university
and
in
the
city
gellert
himself
referred
us
to
the
lectures
now
commenced
by
him
and
as
far
as
the
principal
matter
was
concerned
we
remarked
little
difference
he
too
only
criticised
details
corrected
likewise
with
red
ink
and
one
found
oneself
in
company
with
mere
blunders
without
a
prospect
as
to
where
the
right
was
to
be
sought
i
had
brought
to
him
some
of
my
little
labours
which
he
did
not
treat
harshly
but
just
at
this
time
they
wrote
to
me
from
home
that
i
must
without
fail
furnish
a
poem
for
my
uncle
wedding
i
felt
myself
far
from
that
light
and
frivolous
period
in
which
a
similar
thing
would
have
given
me
pleasure
and
since
i
could
get
nothing
out
of
the
actual
circumstance
itself
i
determined
to
trick
out
my
work
in
the
best
manner
with
extraneous
ornament
i
therefore
convened
all
olympus
to
consult
about
the
marriage
of
a
frankfort
lawyer
and
seriously
enough
to
be
sure
as
well
became
the
festival
of
such
an
honourable
man
venus
and
themis
had
quarrelled
for
his
sake
but
a
roguish
prank
which
amor
played
the
latter
gained
the
suit
for
the
former
and
the
gods
decided
in
favour
of
the
marriage
my
work
by
no
means
displeased
me
i
received
from
home
a
handsome
letter
in
its
praise
took
the
trouble
to
have
another
fair
copy
and
hoped
to
extort
some
applause
from
my
professor
also
but
here
i
had
missed
my
aim
he
took
the
matter
severely
and
as
he
did
not
notice
the
tone
of
parody
which
nevertheless
lay
in
the
notion
he
declared
the
great
expenditure
of
divine
means
for
such
an
insignificant
human
end
in
the
highest
degree
reprehensible
inveighed
against
the
use
and
abuse
of
such
mythological
figures
as
a
false
habit
originating
in
pedantic
times
found
the
expression
now
too
high
now
too
low
and
in
divers
particulars
had
indeed
not
spared
the
red
ink
though
he
asserted
that
he
had
yet
done
too
little
such
pieces
were
read
out
and
criticised
anonymously
it
is
true
but
we
used
to
watch
each
other
and
it
remained
no
secret
that
this
unfortunate
assembly
of
the
gods
was
my
work
yet
since
his
critique
when
i
took
his
point
of
view
seemed
to
be
perfectly
just
and
those
divinities
more
nearly
inspected
were
in
fact
only
hollow
i
cursed
all
olympus
flung
the
whole
mythic
pantheon
away
and
from
that
time
amor
and
luna
have
been
the
only
divinities
which
at
all
appear
in
my
little
poems
ridicule
of
clodius
among
the
persons
whom
behrisch
had
chosen
as
the
butts
of
his
wit
clodius
stood
just
at
the
head
nor
was
it
hard
to
find
a
comical
side
in
him
as
a
little
rather
stout
figure
he
was
violent
in
his
motions
somewhat
impetuous
in
his
utterances
and
restless
in
his
demeanour
in
all
this
he
differed
from
his
who
nevertheless
willingly
put
up
with
him
on
account
of
his
good
qualities
and
the
fine
promise
which
he
gave
he
was
usually
commissioned
with
the
poems
which
had
become
necessary
on
festal
occasions
in
the
he
followed
the
manner
used
by
ramler
whom
however
it
alone
suited
but
clodius
as
an
imitator
had
especially
marked
the
foreign
words
by
means
of
which
the
poems
of
ramler
come
forth
with
a
majestic
pomp
which
because
it
is
conformable
to
the
greatness
of
his
subject
and
the
rest
of
his
poetic
treatment
produces
a
very
good
effect
on
the
ear
feelings
and
imagination
in
clodius
on
the
contrary
these
expressions
had
a
heterogeneous
air
since
his
poetry
was
in
other
respects
not
calculated
to
elevate
the
mind
in
any
manner
now
we
had
often
been
obliged
to
see
such
poems
printed
and
highly
lauded
in
our
presence
and
we
found
it
highly
offensive
that
he
who
had
sequestered
the
heathen
gods
from
us
now
wished
to
hammer
together
another
ladder
to
parnassus
out
of
greek
and
roman
these
expressions
stamped
themselves
firmly
on
our
memory
and
in
a
merry
hour
when
we
were
eating
some
most
excellent
cakes
in
the
it
all
at
once
struck
me
to
put
together
these
words
of
might
and
power
in
a
poem
on
the
hendel
no
sooner
thought
than
done
and
let
it
stand
here
too
as
it
was
written
on
the
wall
of
the
house
with
a
o
hendel

this
poem
stood
a
long
time
among
many
others
which
disfigured
the
walls
of
that
room
without
being
noticed
and
we
who
had
sufficiently
amused
ourselves
with
it
forgot
it
altogether
amongst
other
things
a
long
time
afterwards
clodius
came
out
with
his
whose
wisdom
magnanimity
and
virtue
we
found
infinitely
ridiculous
much
as
the
first
representation
of
the
piece
was
applauded
that
evening
when
we
met
together
in
the
i
made
a
prologue
in
doggerel
verse
in
which
harlequin
steps
out
with
two
great
sacks
places
them
on
each
side
of
the
and
after
various
preliminary
jokes
tells
the
spectators
in
confidence
that
in
the
two
sacks
moral
dust
is
to
be
found
which
the
actors
will
very
frequently
throw
into
their
eyes
one
to
wit
was
filled
with
good
deeds
that
cost
nothing
and
the
other
with
splendidly
expressed
opinions
that
had
no
meaning
behind
them
he
reluctantly
withdrew
and
sometimes
came
back
earnestly
exhorted
the
spectators
to
attend
to
his
warning
and
shut
their
eyes
reminded
them
that
he
had
always
been
their
friend
and
meant
well
with
them
with
many
more
things
of
the
kind
this
prologue
was
acted
in
the
room
on
the
spot
by
friend
horn
but
the
jest
remained
quite
among
ourselves
not
even
a
copy
had
been
taken
and
the
paper
was
soon
lost
however
horn
who
had
performed
the
harlequin
very
prettily
took
it
into
his
head
to
enlarge
my
poem
to
hendel
by
several
verses
and
then
to
make
it
refer
to
he
read
it
aloud
to
us
and
we
could
not
take
any
pleasure
in
it
for
we
did
not
find
the
additions
even
ingenious
while
the
first
poem
being
written
for
quite
a
different
purpose
seemed
to
us
disfigured
our
friend
out
of
humour
at
our
indifference
or
rather
censure
may
have
shown
it
to
others
who
found
it
new
and
amusing
copies
were
now
made
of
it
to
which
the
reputation
of
clodius
gave
at
once
a
rapid
publicity
universal
disapproval
was
the
consequence
and
the
originators
it
was
soon
found
out
that
the
poem
had
proceeded
from
our
clique
were
severely
censured
for
nothing
of
the
sort
had
been
seen
since
cronegk
and
attacks
upon
gottsched
we
had
besides
already
secluded
ourselves
and
now
found
ourselves
quite
in
the
case
of
the
owl
with
respect
to
the
other
birds
in
dresden
too
they
did
not
like
the
affair
and
it
had
for
us
serious
if
not
unpleasant
consequences
for
some
time
already
count
lindenau
had
not
been
quite
satisfied
with
his
son
tutor
for
although
the
young
man
was
by
no
means
neglected
and
behrisch
kept
himself
either
in
the
chamber
of
the
young
count
or
at
least
close
to
it
when
the
instructors
gave
their
daily
lessons
regularly
frequented
the
lectures
with
him
never
went
out
in
the
without
him
and
accompanied
him
in
all
his
walks
yet
the
rest
of
us
were
always
to
be
found
in
apel
house
and
joined
them
whenever
they
went
on
a
pleasure
ramble
this
already
excited
some
attention
behrisch
too
accustomed
himself
to
our
society
and
at
last
towards
nine
in
the
evenings
generally
transferred
his
pupil
into
the
hands
of
the
de
and
went
in
quest
of
us
to
the
whither
however
he
never
used
to
come
but
in
shoes
and
stockings
with
his
sword
by
his
side
and
commonly
his
hat
under
his
arm
the
jokes
and
fooleries
which
he
generally
started
went
on
thus
for
instance
one
of
our
friends
had
a
habit
of
going
away
precisely
at
ten
because
he
had
a
connexion
with
a
pretty
girl
with
whom
he
could
converse
only
at
that
hour
we
did
not
like
to
lose
him
and
one
evening
when
we
sat
very
happily
together
behrisch
secretly
determined
that
he
would
not
let
him
off
this
time
at
the
stroke
of
ten
the
other
arose
and
took
leave
behrisch
called
after
him
and
begged
him
to
wait
a
moment
as
he
was
just
going
with
him
he
now
began
in
the
most
amusing
manner
first
to
look
after
his
sword
which
stood
just
before
his
eyes
and
in
buckling
it
on
behaved
awkwardly
so
that
he
could
never
accomplish
it
he
did
this
too
so
naturally
that
no
one
took
offence
at
it
but
when
to
vary
the
theme
he
at
last
went
further
so
that
the
sword
came
now
on
the
right
side
now
between
his
legs
an
universal
laughter
arose
in
which
the
man
in
a
hurry
who
was
likewise
a
merry
fellow
chimed
in
and
let
behrisch
have
his
own
way
till
the
happy
hour
was
past
when
for
the
first
time
there
followed
general
pleasure
and
agreeable
conversation
till
deep
into
the
night
eccentricities
of
behrisch
unfortunately
behrisch
and
we
through
him
had
a
certain
other
propensity
for
some
girls
who
were
better
than
their
reputation
by
which
our
own
reputation
could
not
be
improved
we
had
often
been
seen
in
their
garden
and
we
directed
our
walks
thither
even
when
the
young
count
was
with
us
all
this
may
have
been
treasured
up
and
at
last
communicated
to
his
father
enough
he
sought
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
to
get
rid
of
the
tutor
to
whom
the
event
proved
fortunate
his
good
exterior
his
knowledge
and
talents
his
integrity
which
no
one
could
call
in
question
had
won
him
the
affection
and
esteem
of
distinguished
persons
on
whose
recommendation
he
was
appointed
tutor
to
the
hereditary
prince
of
dessau
and
at
the
court
of
a
prince
excellent
in
every
respect
found
a
solid
happiness
the
loss
of
a
friend
like
behrisch
was
of
the
greatest
consequence
to
me
he
spoiled
while
he
cultivated
me
and
his
presence
was
necessary
if
the
pains
he
had
thought
good
to
spend
upon
me
were
in
any
degree
to
bring
forth
fruit
for
society
he
knew
how
to
engage
me
in
all
kinds
of
pretty
and
agreeable
things
in
whatever
was
just
appropriate
and
to
bring
out
my
social
talents
but
as
i
had
gained
no
in
such
things
so
when
i
was
alone
again
i
immediately
relapsed
into
my
confused
and
crabbed
disposition
which
always
increased
the
more
discontented
i
was
with
those
about
me
since
i
fancied
that
they
were
not
contented
with
me
with
the
most
arbitrary
caprice
i
took
offence
at
what
i
might
have
reckoned
as
an
advantage
to
me
thus
alienated
many
with
whom
i
had
hitherto
stood
on
a
tolerable
footing
and
on
account
of
the
many
disagreeable
consequences
which
i
had
drawn
on
myself
and
others
whether
by
doing
or
leaving
undone
by
doing
too
much
or
too
little
was
obliged
to
hear
the
remark
from
my
that
i
lacked
experience
the
same
thing
was
told
me
by
every
person
of
sound
sense
who
saw
my
productions
especially
when
these
referred
to
the
external
world
i
observed
this
as
well
as
i
could
but
found
in
it
little
that
was
edifying
and
was
still
forced
to
add
enough
of
my
own
to
make
it
only
tolerable
i
had
often
pressed
my
friend
behrisch
too
that
he
would
make
plain
to
me
what
experience
might
be
but
because
he
was
full
of
nonsense
he
put
me
off
with
fair
words
from
one
day
to
another
and
at
last
after
great
preparations
disclosed
to
me
that
true
experience
was
properly
when
one
experiences
how
an
experienced
man
must
experience
in
experiencing
his
experience
now
when
we
scolded
him
outrageously
and
called
him
to
account
for
this
he
assured
us
that
a
great
mystery
lay
hidden
behind
these
words
which
we
could
not
comprehend
until
we
had
experienced
and
so
on
without
end
for
it
cost
him
nothing
to
talk
on
in
that
way
by
the
quarter
of
an
hour
since
the
experience
would
always
become
more
experienced
and
at
last
come
to
true
experience
when
we
were
falling
into
despair
at
such
fooleries
he
protested
that
he
had
learned
this
way
of
making
himself
intelligible
and
impressive
from
the
latest
and
greatest
authors
who
had
made
us
observe
how
one
can
rest
a
restful
rest
and
how
silence
in
being
silent
can
constantly
become
more
silent
what
is
experience
by
chance
an
officer
who
came
among
us
on
furlough
was
praised
in
good
company
as
a
remarkable
and
experienced
man
who
had
fought
through
the
seven
years
war
and
had
gained
universal
confidence
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
approach
him
and
we
often
went
walking
with
each
other
the
idea
of
experience
had
almost
become
fixed
in
my
brain
and
the
craving
to
make
it
clear
to
me
passionate
as
i
was
i
disclosed
to
him
the
uneasiness
in
which
i
found
myself
he
smiled
and
was
kind
enough
to
tell
me
as
an
answer
to
my
question
something
of
his
own
life
and
generally
of
the
world
immediately
about
us
from
which
indeed
little
better
was
to
be
gathered
than
that
experience
convinces
us
that
our
best
thoughts
wishes
and
designs
are
unattainable
and
that
he
who
fosters
such
vagaries
and
advances
them
with
eagerness
is
especially
held
to
be
an
inexperienced
man
what
is
experience
yet
as
he
was
a
gallant
good
fellow
he
assured
me
that
he
had
himself
not
quite
given
up
these
vagaries
and
felt
himself
tolerably
well
off
with
the
little
faith
love
and
hope
which
remained
he
then
felt
obliged
to
tell
me
a
great
deal
about
war
about
the
sort
of
life
in
the
field
about
skirmishes
and
battles
especially
so
far
as
he
had
taken
part
in
them
when
these
vast
events
by
being
considered
in
relation
to
a
single
individual
gained
a
very
marvellous
aspect
i
then
led
him
on
to
an
open
narration
of
the
late
situation
of
the
court
which
seemed
to
me
quite
like
a
tale
i
heard
of
the
bodily
strength
of
augustus
the
second
of
his
many
children
and
his
vast
expenses
then
of
his
successor
love
of
art
and
of
making
collections
of
count
brühl
and
his
boundless
love
of
magnificence
which
in
detail
appeared
almost
absurd
of
his
numerous
banquets
and
gorgeous
amusements
which
were
all
cut
off
by
frederick
invasion
of
saxony
the
royal
castles
now
lay
in
ruins
brühl
splendours
were
annihilated
and
of
the
whole
a
glorious
land
much
injured
alone
remained
when
he
saw
me
astonished
at
that
mad
enjoyment
of
fortune
and
then
grieved
by
the
calamity
that
followed
and
informed
me
that
one
expects
from
an
experienced
man
exactly
this
that
he
shall
be
astonished
at
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
nor
take
too
lively
an
interest
in
them
i
felt
a
great
desire
still
to
remain
awhile
in
the
same
inexperience
as
hitherto
in
which
desire
he
strengthened
me
and
very
urgently
entreated
me
for
the
present
at
least
always
to
cling
to
agreeable
experiences
and
to
try
to
avoid
those
that
were
disagreeable
as
much
as
possible
if
they
should
intrude
themselves
upon
me
but
once
when
the
discussion
was
again
about
experience
in
general
and
i
related
to
him
those
ludicrous
phrases
of
my
friend
behrisch
he
shook
his
head
smiling
and
said
there
one
sees
how
it
is
with
words
which
are
only
once
uttered
these
sound
so
comical
nay
so
silly
that
it
would
seem
almost
impossible
to
put
a
rational
meaning
into
them
and
yet
perhaps
the
attempt
might
be
made
and
when
i
pressed
him
he
replied
in
his
intelligent
cheerful
manner
if
you
will
allow
me
while
commenting
on
and
completing
your
friend
to
go
on
after
his
fashion
think
he
meant
to
say
that
experience
is
nothing
else
than
that
one
experiences
what
one
does
not
wish
to
experience
which
is
what
it
amounts
to
for
the
most
part
at
least
in
this
world
die
laune
des
verliebten
translated
as
lover
see
footnote
in
a
dramatic
sense
properly
means
a
statement
of
the
events
which
take
place
before
the
action
of
the
play
the
real
meaning
of
the
passage
is
that
the
idiom
possen
reissen
used
also
with
the
university
word
suite
so
that
one
can
say
suiten
the
the
word
is
also
used
in
university
language
to
denote
a
professor
audience
the
humour
of
the
above
consists
not
in
the
thoughts
but
in
the
particular
words
employed
these
have
no
remarkable
effect
in
english
as
to
us
the
words
of
latin
origin
are
often
as
familiar
as
those
which
have
teutonic
roots
and
these
form
the
chief
peculiarity
of
the
style
we
have
therefore
given
the
poem
in
the
original
language
with
the
peculiar
words
as
indicated
by
goethe
in
italics
and
subjoin
a
literal
translation
it
will
be
observed
that
we
have
said
that
the
peculiarity
consists
not
in
the
use
of
the
foreign
words
for
there
are
two
or
three
instances
of
unquestionably
german
words
which
are
italicised

is
the
of
the
of
the
eighth
book
oeser
another
man
although
infinitely
different
from
behrisch
in
every
respect
might
yet
be
compared
with
him
in
a
certain
sense
i
mean
oeser
who
was
also
one
of
those
men
who
dream
away
their
lives
in
a
comfortable
state
of
being
busy
his
friends
themselves
secretly
acknowledged
that
with
very
fine
natural
powers
he
had
not
spent
his
younger
years
in
sufficient
activity
for
which
reason
he
never
went
so
far
as
to
practise
his
art
with
perfect
technicality
yet
a
certain
diligence
appeared
to
be
reserved
for
his
old
age
and
during
the
many
years
which
i
knew
him
he
never
lacked
invention
or
laboriousness
from
the
very
first
moment
he
had
much
attracted
me
even
his
residence
strange
and
portentous
was
highly
charming
to
me
in
the
old
castle
pleissenburg
at
the
corner
one
ascended
a
repaired
cheerful
winding
staircase
the
saloons
of
the
academy
of
design
of
which
he
was
director
were
found
to
the
left
and
were
light
and
roomy
but
he
himself
could
only
be
reached
through
a
narrow
dark
passage
at
the
end
of
which
one
first
sought
the
entrance
into
his
apartments
having
just
passed
between
the
whole
suite
of
them
and
an
extensive
granary
the
first
apartment
was
adorned
with
pictures
from
the
later
italian
school
by
masters
whose
grace
he
used
highly
to
commend
as
i
with
some
noblemen
had
taken
private
lessons
of
him
we
were
permitted
to
draw
here
and
we
often
penetrated
into
his
adjoining
private
cabinet
which
contained
at
the
same
time
his
few
books
collections
of
art
and
natural
curiosities
and
whatever
else
might
have
most
interested
him
everything
was
arranged
with
taste
simply
and
in
such
a
manner
that
the
little
space
held
a
great
deal
the
furniture
presses
and
portfolios
were
elegant
without
affectation
or
superfluity
thus
also
the
first
thing
which
he
recommended
to
us
and
to
which
he
always
recurred
was
simplicity
in
everything
that
art
and
manual
labour
united
are
called
upon
to
produce
as
a
sworn
foe
of
the
style
and
of
the
whole
taste
for
quaintness
he
showed
us
in
and
drawings
old
patterns
of
the
sort
contrasted
with
better
decorations
and
simpler
forms
of
furniture
as
well
as
with
other
appurtenances
of
a
room
and
because
everything
about
him
corresponded
with
these
maxims
his
words
and
instructions
made
a
good
and
lasting
impression
on
us
besides
this
he
had
an
opportunity
to
let
us
see
his
opinions
in
practice
since
he
stood
in
good
consideration
both
with
private
and
with
official
persons
and
was
asked
for
advice
when
there
were
new
buildings
and
alterations
he
seemed
in
general
to
be
more
fond
of
preparing
anything
on
occasion
for
a
certain
end
and
use
than
of
undertaking
and
completing
things
which
exist
for
themselves
and
require
a
greater
perfection
he
was
therefore
always
ready
and
at
hand
when
the
publishers
needed
larger
and
smaller
for
any
work
thus
the
vignettes
to
winckelmann
first
writings
were
etched
by
him
but
he
often
made
only
very
sketchy
drawings
to
which
geyser
knew
very
well
how
to
adapt
himself
his
figures
had
throughout
something
general
not
to
say
ideal
his
women
were
pleasing
and
agreeable
his
children
enough
only
he
could
not
succeed
with
the
men
who
in
his
spirited
but
always
cloudy
and
at
the
same
time
foreshortening
manner
had
for
the
most
part
the
look
of
since
he
designed
his
composition
less
with
regard
to
form
than
to
light
shade
and
masses
the
general
effect
was
good
as
indeed
all
that
he
did
and
produced
was
attended
by
a
peculiar
grace
as
he
at
the
same
time
neither
could
nor
would
control
a
propensity
to
the
significant
and
the
allegorical
to
that
which
excites
a
secondary
thought
so
his
works
always
furnished
something
to
reflect
upon
and
were
complete
through
a
conception
even
where
they
could
not
be
so
from
art
and
execution
this
bias
which
is
always
dangerous
frequently
led
him
to
the
very
bounds
of
good
taste
if
not
beyond
them
he
often
sought
to
attain
his
views
by
the
oddest
notions
and
by
whimsical
jests
nay
his
best
works
always
have
a
touch
of
humour
if
the
public
were
not
always
satisfied
with
such
things
he
revenged
himself
by
a
new
and
even
stranger
drollery
thus
he
afterwards
exhibited
in
the
of
the
great
an
ideal
female
figure
in
his
own
style
who
was
raising
a
pair
of
snuffers
to
a
taper
and
he
was
extraordinarily
delighted
when
he
was
able
to
cause
a
dispute
on
the
question
whether
this
singular
muse
meant
to
snuff
the
light
or
to
extinguish
it
when
he
roguishly
allowed
all
sorts
of
bantering
to
peep
forth
but
the
building
of
the
new
theatre
in
my
time
made
the
greatest
noise
in
which
his
curtain
when
it
was
still
quite
new
had
certainly
an
uncommonly
charming
effect
oeser
had
taken
the
muses
out
of
the
clouds
upon
which
they
usually
hover
on
such
occasions
and
set
them
upon
the
earth
the
statues
of
sophocles
and
aristophanes
around
whom
all
the
modern
dramatic
writers
were
assembled
adorned
a
vestibule
to
the
temple
of
fame
here
too
the
goddesses
of
the
arts
were
likewise
present
and
all
was
dignified
and
beautiful
but
now
comes
the
oddity
through
the
open
centre
was
seen
the
portal
of
the
distant
temple
and
a
man
in
a
light
jerkin
was
passing
between
the
two
groups
and
without
troubling
himself
about
them
directly
up
to
the
temple
he
was
seen
from
behind
and
was
not
particularly
distinguished
now
this
man
was
to
represent
shakspeare
who
without
predecessors
or
followers
without
concerning
himself
about
models
went
to
meet
immortality
in
his
own
way
this
work
was
executed
on
the
great
floor
over
the
new
theatre
we
often
assembled
round
him
there
and
in
that
place
i
read
aloud
to
him
the
of
influence
of
oeser
as
to
myself
i
by
no
means
advanced
in
the
practice
of
the
art
his
instructions
worked
upon
our
mind
and
our
taste
but
his
own
drawing
was
too
undefined
to
guide
me
who
had
only
glimmered
along
by
the
objects
of
art
and
of
nature
to
a
severe
and
decided
practice
of
the
faces
and
bodies
he
gave
us
rather
the
aspect
than
the
forms
rather
the
postures
than
the
proportions
he
gave
us
the
conceptions
of
the
figures
and
desired
that
we
should
impress
them
vividly
upon
our
minds
that
might
have
been
beautifully
and
properly
done
if
he
had
not
had
mere
beginners
before
him
if
on
this
account
a
talent
for
instruction
may
be
well
denied
him
it
must
on
the
other
hand
be
acknowledged
that
he
was
very
discreet
and
politic
and
that
a
happy
adroitness
of
mind
qualified
him
very
peculiarly
for
a
teacher
in
a
higher
sense
the
deficiencies
under
which
each
one
laboured
he
clearly
saw
but
he
disdained
to
reprove
them
directly
and
rather
hinted
his
praise
and
censure
indirectly
and
very
laconically
one
was
now
compelled
to
think
over
the
matter
and
soon
came
to
a
far
deeper
insight
thus
for
instance
i
had
very
carefully
executed
after
a
pattern
a
nosegay
on
blue
paper
with
white
and
black
crayon
and
partly
with
the
stump
partly
by
hatching
it
up
had
tried
to
give
effect
to
the
little
picture
after
i
had
been
long
labouring
in
this
way
he
once
came
behind
me
and
said
more
paper
upon
which
he
immediately
withdrew
my
neighbour
and
i
puzzled
our
heads
as
to
what
this
could
mean
for
my
bouquet
on
a
large
had
plenty
of
space
around
it
after
we
had
reflected
a
long
while
we
thought
at
last
that
we
had
hit
his
meaning
when
we
remarked
that
by
working
together
the
black
and
the
white
i
had
quite
covered
up
the
blue
ground
had
destroyed
the
middle
tint
and
in
fact
with
great
industry
had
produced
a
disagreeable
drawing
as
to
the
rest
he
did
not
fail
to
instruct
us
in
perspective
and
in
light
and
shade
sufficiently
indeed
but
always
so
that
we
had
to
exert
and
torment
ourselves
to
find
the
application
of
the
principles
communicated
probably
his
view
with
regard
to
us
who
did
not
intend
to
become
artists
was
only
to
form
the
judgment
and
taste
and
to
make
us
acquainted
with
the
requisites
of
a
work
of
art
without
precisely
requiring
that
we
should
produce
one
since
moreover
patient
industry
was
not
my
talent
for
nothing
gave
me
pleasure
except
what
came
to
me
at
once
so
by
degrees
i
became
discouraged
if
not
lazy
and
as
knowledge
is
more
comfortable
than
doing
i
was
quite
content
to
follow
wherever
he
chose
after
his
own
fashion
to
lead
us
at
this
time
the
of
the
by
was
translated
into
german
i
obtained
it
quite
fresh
and
studied
it
assiduously
enough
this
seemed
to
please
oeser
and
he
procured
us
an
opportunity
of
seeing
many
a
portfolio
out
of
the
great
leipzig
collections
and
thus
introduced
us
to
the
history
of
the
art
but
even
these
exercises
produced
in
me
an
effect
different
from
that
which
he
probably
had
in
mind
the
manifold
subjects
which
i
saw
treated
by
artists
awakened
the
poetic
talent
in
me
and
as
one
easily
makes
an
engraving
for
a
poem
so
did
i
now
make
poems
to
the
engravings
and
drawings
by
contriving
to
present
to
myself
the
personages
introduced
in
them
in
their
previous
and
subsequent
condition
and
sometimes
to
compose
a
little
song
which
might
have
suited
them
and
thus
accustomed
myself
to
consider
the
arts
in
connexion
with
each
other
even
the
mistakes
which
i
made
so
that
my
poems
were
often
descriptive
were
useful
to
me
in
the
sequel
when
i
came
to
more
reflection
by
making
me
attentive
to
the
differences
between
the
arts
of
the
little
things
many
were
in
the
collection
which
behrisch
had
arranged
but
there
is
nothing
left
of
them
now
the
atmosphere
of
art
and
taste
in
which
oeser
lived
and
into
which
one
was
drawn
provided
one
visited
him
frequently
was
the
more
and
more
worthy
and
delightful
because
he
was
fond
of
remembering
departed
or
absent
persons
with
whom
he
had
been
or
still
continued
to
be
on
good
terms
for
if
he
had
once
given
any
one
his
esteem
he
remained
unalterable
in
his
conduct
towards
him
and
always
showed
himself
equally
friendly
after
we
had
heard
caylus
extolled
among
the
french
he
made
us
also
acquainted
with
germans
of
activity
in
this
department
thus
we
learned
that
professor
christ
as
an
amateur
a
collector
a
connoisseur
a
had
done
good
service
for
art
and
had
applied
his
learning
to
its
true
improvement
on
the
contrary
could
not
be
honourably
mentioned
partly
because
he
devoted
himself
too
assiduously
to
the
beginnings
of
german
art
which
oeser
little
valued
partly
because
he
had
once
treated
winckelmann
shabbily
which
could
never
be
forgiven
him
our
attention
however
was
strongly
drawn
to
the
labours
of
lippert
since
our
instructor
knew
how
to
set
forth
his
merits
sufficiently
for
he
said
although
single
statues
and
larger
groups
of
sculpture
remain
the
foundation
and
the
summit
of
all
knowledge
of
art
yet
either
as
originals
or
as
casts
they
are
seldom
to
be
seen
on
the
contrary
by
lippert
a
little
world
of
gems
is
made
known
in
which
the
more
comprehensible
merit
of
the
ancients
their
happy
invention
judicious
composition
tasteful
treatment
are
made
more
striking
and
intelligible
while
from
the
great
number
of
them
comparison
is
much
more
possible
while
now
we
were
busying
ourselves
with
these
as
much
as
was
allowed
winckelmann
lofty
life
of
art
in
italy
was
pointed
out
and
we
took
his
first
writings
in
hand
with
devotion
for
oeser
had
a
passionate
reverence
for
him
which
he
was
able
easily
to
instil
into
us
the
problematical
part
of
those
little
treatises
which
are
besides
confused
even
from
their
irony
and
from
their
referring
to
opinions
and
events
altogether
peculiar
we
were
indeed
unable
to
decipher
but
as
oeser
had
great
influence
over
us
and
incessantly
gave
them
out
to
us
as
the
gospel
of
the
beautiful
and
still
more
of
the
tasteful
and
the
pleasing
we
found
out
the
general
sense
and
fancied
that
with
such
interpretations
we
should
go
on
the
more
securely
as
we
regarded
it
no
small
happiness
to
draw
from
the
same
fountain
from
which
winckelmann
had
allayed
his
earliest
thirst
feeling
for
art
in
leipzig
no
greater
good
fortune
can
befall
a
city
than
when
several
educated
men
in
what
is
good
and
right
live
together
in
it
leipzig
had
this
advantage
and
enjoyed
it
the
more
peacefully
as
so
many
differences
of
judgment
had
not
yet
manifested
themselves
huber
a
print
collector
and
a
connoisseur
had
furthermore
the
gratefully
acknowledged
merit
of
having
determined
to
make
the
worth
of
german
literature
known
to
the
french
kreuchauf
an
amateur
with
a
practised
eye
who
as
the
friend
of
the
whole
society
of
art
might
regard
all
collections
as
his
own
winkler
who
much
loved
to
share
with
others
the
intelligent
delight
which
he
cherished
for
his
treasures
many
more
who
were
added
to
the
list
all
lived
and
laboured
with
one
feeling
and
often
as
i
was
permitted
to
be
present
when
they
examined
works
of
art
i
do
not
remember
that
a
dispute
ever
arose
the
school
from
which
the
artist
had
proceeded
the
time
in
which
he
lived
the
peculiar
talent
which
nature
had
bestowed
on
him
and
the
degree
of
excellence
to
which
he
had
brought
it
in
his
performances
were
always
fairly
considered
there
was
no
prejudice
for
spiritual
or
terrestrial
subjects
for
landscape
or
for
city
views
for
animate
or
inanimate
the
question
was
always
about
the
accordance
with
art
now
although
from
their
situation
mode
of
thought
abilities
and
opportunities
these
amateurs
and
collectors
inclined
more
to
the
dutch
school
yet
while
the
eye
was
practised
on
the
endless
merits
of
the
artist
a
look
of
reverential
longing
was
always
turned
towards
the
and
so
the
university
where
i
neglected
the
ends
both
of
my
family
and
myself
was
to
ground
me
in
that
in
which
i
afterwards
found
the
greatest
satisfaction
of
my
life
the
impression
of
those
localities
too
in
which
i
received
such
important
incitements
has
always
remained
to
me
most
dear
and
precious
the
old
pleissenburg
the
rooms
of
the
academy
but
above
all
the
abode
of
oeser
and
no
less
the
collections
of
winkler
and
richter
i
have
always
vividly
present
before
me
but
a
young
man
who
while
older
persons
are
conversing
with
each
other
on
subjects
already
familiar
to
them
is
instructed
only
incidentally
and
for
whom
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
business
that
of
rightly
arranging
all
yet
remains
must
find
himself
in
a
very
painful
situation
i
therefore
as
well
as
others
looked
about
with
longing
for
some
new
light
which
was
indeed
to
come
to
us
from
a
man
to
whom
we
owed
so
much
already
lessing
laocoön
the
mind
can
be
highly
delighted
in
two
ways
by
perception
and
conception
but
the
former
demands
a
worthy
object
which
is
not
always
at
hand
and
a
proportionate
culture
which
one
does
not
immediately
attain
conception
on
the
other
hand
requires
only
susceptibility
it
brings
its
with
it
and
is
itself
the
instrument
of
culture
hence
that
beam
of
light
was
most
welcome
to
us
which
that
most
excellent
thinker
brought
down
to
us
through
dark
clouds
one
must
be
a
young
man
to
render
present
to
oneself
the
effect
which
lessing
produced
upon
us
by
transporting
us
out
of
the
region
of
scanty
perceptions
into
the
open
fields
of
thought
the
so
long
misunderstood
pictura
was
at
once
laid
aside
the
difference
between
plastic
and
speaking
art
was
made
clear
the
summits
of
the
two
now
appeared
sundered
however
near
their
bases
might
border
on
each
other
the
plastic
artist
was
to
keep
himself
within
the
bounds
of
the
beautiful
if
the
artist
of
language
who
can
not
dispense
with
the
significant
in
any
kind
is
permitted
to
ramble
abroad
beyond
them
the
former
labours
for
the
outer
sense
which
is
satisfied
only
by
the
beautiful
the
latter
for
the
imagination
which
may
even
reconcile
itself
to
the
ugly
all
the
consequences
of
this
splendid
thought
were
illumined
to
us
as
by
a
lightning
flash
all
the
criticism
which
had
hitherto
guided
and
judged
was
thrown
away
like
a
coat
we
considered
ourselves
freed
from
all
evil
and
fancied
we
might
venture
to
look
down
with
some
compassion
upon
the
otherwise
so
splendid
sixteenth
century
when
in
german
sculptures
and
poems
they
knew
how
to
represent
life
only
under
the
form
of
a
fool
hung
with
bells
death
under
the
misformed
shape
of
a
rattling
skeleton
and
the
necessary
and
accidental
evils
of
the
world
under
the
image
of
the
caricatured
devil
we
were
the
most
enchanted
with
the
beauty
of
that
thought
that
the
ancients
had
recognised
death
as
the
brother
of
sleep
and
had
represented
them
similar
even
to
confusion
as
becomes
menæchmi
here
we
could
first
do
high
honour
to
the
triumph
of
the
beautiful
and
banish
the
ugly
of
every
kind
into
the
low
sphere
of
the
ridiculous
in
the
kingdom
of
art
since
it
could
not
be
utterly
driven
out
of
the
world
the
splendour
of
such
leading
and
fundamental
conceptions
appears
only
to
the
mind
upon
which
they
exercise
their
infinite
activity
appears
only
to
the
age
in
which
after
being
longed
for
they
come
forth
at
the
right
moment
then
do
those
at
whose
disposal
such
nourishment
is
placed
fondly
occupy
whole
periods
of
their
lives
with
it
and
rejoice
in
a
superabundant
growth
while
men
are
not
wanting
meanwhile
who
resist
such
an
effect
on
the
spot
nor
others
who
afterwards
haggle
and
cavil
at
its
high
meaning
but
as
conception
and
perception
mutually
require
each
other
i
could
not
long
work
up
these
new
thoughts
without
an
infinite
desire
arising
within
me
to
see
important
works
of
art
once
and
away
in
great
number
i
therefore
determined
to
visit
dresden
without
delay
i
was
not
in
want
of
the
necessary
cash
but
there
were
other
difficulties
to
overcome
which
i
needlessly
increased
still
further
through
my
whimsical
disposition
for
i
kept
my
purpose
a
secret
from
every
one
because
i
wished
to
contemplate
the
treasures
of
art
there
quite
after
my
own
way
and
as
i
thought
to
allow
no
one
to
perplex
me
besides
this
so
simple
a
matter
became
more
complicated
by
still
another
eccentricity
we
have
weaknesses
both
by
birth
and
by
education
and
it
may
be
questioned
which
of
the
two
gives
us
the
most
trouble
willingly
as
i
made
myself
familiar
with
all
sorts
of
conditions
and
many
as
had
been
my
inducements
to
do
so
an
excessive
aversion
from
all
inns
had
nevertheless
been
instilled
into
me
by
my
father
this
feeling
had
rooted
itself
firmly
in
him
on
his
travels
through
italy
france
and
germany
although
he
seldom
spoke
in
images
and
only
called
them
to
his
aid
when
he
was
very
cheerful
yet
he
used
often
to
repeat
that
he
always
fancied
he
saw
a
great
cobweb
spun
across
the
gate
of
an
inn
so
ingeniously
that
the
insects
could
indeed
fly
in
but
that
even
the
privileged
wasps
could
not
fly
out
again
unplucked
it
seemed
to
him
something
horrible
that
one
should
be
obliged
to
pay
immoderately
for
renouncing
one
habits
and
all
that
was
dear
to
one
in
life
and
living
after
the
manner
of
publicans
and
waiters
he
praised
the
hospitality
of
the
olden
time
and
reluctantly
as
he
otherwise
endured
even
anything
unusual
in
the
house
he
yet
practised
hospitality
especially
towards
artists
and
virtuosi
thus
gossip
seekatz
always
had
his
quarters
with
us
and
abel
the
last
musician
who
handled
the
di
with
success
and
applause
was
well
received
and
entertained
with
such
youthful
impressions
which
nothing
had
as
yet
rubbed
off
how
could
i
have
resolved
to
set
foot
in
an
inn
in
a
strange
city
nothing
would
have
been
easier
than
to
find
quarters
with
good
friends
hofrath
krebel
assessor
hermann
and
others
had
often
spoken
to
me
about
it
already
but
even
to
these
my
trip
was
to
remain
a
secret
and
i
hit
upon
a
most
singular
notion
my
neighbour
the
industrious
theologian
whose
eyes
unfortunately
constantly
grew
weaker
and
weaker
had
a
relation
in
dresden
a
shoemaker
with
whom
from
time
to
time
he
corresponded
for
a
long
while
already
this
man
had
been
highly
remarkable
to
me
on
account
of
his
expressions
and
the
arrival
of
one
of
his
letters
was
always
celebrated
by
us
as
a
holiday
the
mode
in
which
he
replied
to
the
complaints
of
his
cousin
who
feared
blindness
was
quite
peculiar
for
he
did
not
trouble
himself
about
grounds
of
consolation
which
are
always
hard
to
find
but
the
cheerful
way
in
which
he
looked
upon
his
own
narrow
poor
toilsome
life
the
merriment
which
he
drew
even
from
evils
and
inconveniences
the
indestructible
conviction
that
life
is
in
itself
and
on
its
own
account
a
blessing
communicated
itself
to
him
who
read
the
letter
and
for
the
moment
at
least
transposed
him
into
a
like
mood
enthusiastic
as
i
was
i
had
often
sent
my
compliments
to
this
man
extolled
his
happy
natural
gift
and
expressed
the
wish
to
become
acquainted
with
him
all
this
being
premised
nothing
seemed
to
me
more
natural
than
to
seek
him
out
to
converse
with
him
nay
to
lodge
with
him
and
to
learn
to
know
him
intimately
my
good
candidate
after
some
opposition
gave
me
a
letter
written
with
difficulty
to
carry
with
me
and
full
of
longing
i
went
to
dresden
in
the
yellow
coach
with
my
matriculation
in
my
pocket
the
dresden
shoemaker
i
looked
for
my
shoemaker
and
soon
found
him
in
the
suburb
he
received
me
in
a
friendly
manner
sitting
upon
his
stool
and
said
smiling
after
he
had
read
the
letter
i
see
from
this
young
sir
that
you
are
a
whimsical
christian
how
so
master
replied
i
no
offence
meant
by
he
continued
one
calls
every
one
so
who
is
not
consistent
with
himself
and
i
call
you
a
whimsical
christian
because
you
acknowledge
yourself
a
follower
of
our
lord
in
one
thing
but
not
in
another
on
my
requesting
him
to
enlighten
me
he
said
further
it
seems
that
your
view
is
to
announce
glad
tidings
to
the
poor
and
lowly
that
is
good
and
this
imitation
of
the
lord
is
praiseworthy
but
you
should
reflect
besides
that
he
rather
sat
down
to
table
with
prosperous
rich
folks
where
there
was
good
fare
and
that
he
himself
did
not
despise
the
sweet
scent
of
the
ointment
of
which
you
will
find
the
opposite
in
my
house
this
pleasant
beginning
put
me
at
once
in
and
we
rallied
each
other
for
some
time
his
wife
stood
doubting
how
she
should
board
and
lodge
such
a
guest
on
this
point
too
he
had
notions
which
referred
not
only
to
the
bible
but
also
to
and
when
we
were
agreed
that
i
was
to
stay
i
gave
my
purse
such
as
it
was
into
the
charge
of
my
hostess
and
requested
her
to
furnish
herself
from
it
if
anything
should
be
necessary
when
he
would
have
declined
it
and
somewhat
waggishly
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
was
not
so
burnt
out
as
he
might
appear
i
disarmed
him
by
saying
even
if
it
were
only
to
change
water
into
wine
such
a
domestic
resource
would
not
be
out
of
place
since
there
are
no
more
miracles
the
hostess
seemed
to
find
my
conduct
less
and
less
strange
we
had
soon
accommodated
ourselves
to
each
other
and
spent
a
very
merry
evening
he
remained
always
the
same
because
all
flowed
from
one
source
his
peculiarity
was
an
apt
which
rested
upon
a
cheerful
disposition
and
took
delight
in
uniform
habitual
activity
that
he
should
labour
incessantly
was
his
first
and
most
necessary
care
that
he
regarded
everything
else
as
secondary
this
kept
up
his
comfortable
state
of
mind
and
i
must
reckon
him
before
many
others
in
the
class
of
those
who
are
called
practical
unconscious
philosophers
the
hour
when
the
gallery
was
to
open
after
being
expected
with
impatience
appeared
i
entered
into
this
sanctuary
and
my
astonishment
surpassed
every
conception
which
i
had
formed
this
saloon
returning
into
itself
in
which
splendour
and
neatness
reigned
together
with
the
deepest
stillness
the
dazzling
frames
all
nearer
to
the
time
in
which
they
had
been
gilded
the
floor
polished
with
the
spaces
more
trodden
by
spectators
than
used
by
copyists
imparted
a
feeling
of
solemnity
unique
of
its
kind
which
so
much
the
more
resembled
the
sensation
with
which
one
treads
a
church
as
the
adornments
of
so
many
a
temple
the
objects
of
so
much
adoration
seemed
here
again
set
up
only
for
the
sacred
purposes
of
art
i
readily
put
up
with
the
cursory
description
of
my
conductor
only
i
requested
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
outer
gallery
here
to
my
comfort
i
found
myself
really
at
home
i
had
already
seen
the
works
of
several
artists
others
i
knew
from
engravings
others
by
name
i
did
not
conceal
this
and
i
thus
inspired
my
conductor
with
some
confidence
nay
the
rapture
which
i
expressed
at
pieces
where
the
pencil
had
gained
the
victory
over
nature
delighted
him
for
such
were
the
things
which
principally
attracted
me
where
the
comparison
with
known
nature
must
necessarily
enhance
the
value
of
art
when
i
again
entered
my
shoemaker
house
to
dinner
i
scarcely
believed
my
eyes
for
i
fancied
i
saw
before
me
a
picture
by
ostade
so
perfect
that
one
could
only
hang
it
up
in
the
gallery
the
position
of
the
objects
the
light
the
shadow
the
brownish
tint
of
the
whole
the
magical
harmony
everything
that
one
admires
in
those
pictures
i
here
saw
in
reality
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
perceived
in
so
high
a
degree
the
faculty
which
i
afterwards
exercised
with
more
consciousness
namely
that
of
seeing
nature
with
the
eyes
of
this
or
that
artist
to
whose
works
i
had
devoted
a
particular
attention
this
faculty
has
afforded
me
much
enjoyment
but
has
also
increased
the
desire
zealously
to
abandon
myself
from
time
to
time
to
the
exercise
of
a
talent
which
nature
seemed
to
have
denied
me
counsellor
riedel
i
visited
the
gallery
at
all
permitted
hours
and
continued
to
express
too
loudly
my
ecstasy
at
many
precious
works
i
thus
frustrated
my
laudable
purpose
of
remaining
unknown
and
unnoticed
and
whereas
only
one
of
the
had
hitherto
had
intercourse
with
me
the
counsellor
riedel
now
also
took
notice
of
me
and
made
me
attentive
to
many
things
which
seemed
chiefly
to
lie
within
my
sphere
i
found
this
excellent
man
just
as
active
and
obliging
then
as
when
i
afterwards
saw
him
during
many
years
and
as
he
shows
himself
to
this
day
his
image
has
for
me
interwoven
itself
so
closely
with
those
treasures
of
art
that
i
can
never
regard
the
two
apart
the
remembrance
of
him
has
even
accompanied
me
to
italy
where
in
many
large
and
rich
collections
his
presence
would
have
been
very
desirable
since
even
with
strangers
and
unknown
persons
one
can
not
gaze
on
such
works
silently
and
without
mutual
sympathy
nay
since
the
first
sight
of
them
is
rather
adapted
in
the
highest
degree
to
open
hearts
towards
each
other
i
fell
there
into
conversation
with
a
young
man
who
seemed
to
be
residing
at
dresden
and
to
belong
to
some
embassy
he
invited
me
to
come
in
the
evening
to
an
inn
where
a
lively
company
met
and
where
by
each
one
paying
a
moderate
reckoning
one
could
pass
some
very
pleasant
hours
i
repaired
thither
but
did
not
find
the
company
and
the
waiter
somewhat
surprised
me
when
he
delivered
the
compliments
of
the
gentleman
who
made
the
appointment
with
me
by
which
the
latter
sent
an
excuse
for
coming
somewhat
later
with
the
addition
that
i
must
not
take
offence
at
anything
that
might
occur
also
that
i
should
have
nothing
to
pay
beyond
my
own
score
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
these
words
my
father
cobwebs
came
into
my
head
and
i
composed
myself
to
await
whatever
might
befall
the
company
assembled
my
acquaintance
introduced
me
and
i
could
not
be
attentive
long
without
discovering
that
they
were
aiming
at
the
mystification
of
a
young
man
who
showed
himself
a
novice
by
an
obstreperous
assuming
deportment
i
therefore
kept
very
much
on
my
guard
so
that
they
might
not
find
delight
in
selecting
me
as
his
fellow
at
table
this
intention
became
more
apparent
to
everybody
except
to
himself
they
drank
deeper
and
deeper
and
when
a
in
honour
of
sweethearts
was
started
every
one
solemnly
swore
that
there
should
never
be
another
out
of
those
glasses
they
flung
them
behind
them
and
this
was
the
signal
for
far
greater
follies
at
last
i
withdrew
very
quietly
and
the
waiter
while
demanding
quite
a
moderate
reckoning
requested
me
to
come
again
as
they
did
not
go
on
so
wildly
every
evening
i
was
far
from
my
lodgings
and
it
was
near
midnight
when
i
reached
them
i
found
the
doors
unlocked
everybody
was
in
bed
and
one
lamp
illuminated
the
narrow
domestic
household
where
my
eye
more
and
more
practised
immediately
perceived
the
finest
picture
by
schalken
from
which
i
could
not
tear
myself
away
so
that
it
banished
from
me
all
sleep
the
few
days
of
my
residence
in
dresden
were
solely
devoted
to
the
the
antiquities
still
stood
in
the
pavilion
of
the
great
garden
but
i
declined
seeing
them
as
well
as
all
the
other
precious
things
which
dresden
contained
being
but
too
full
of
the
conviction
that
even
in
and
about
the
collection
of
paintings
much
must
yet
remain
hidden
from
me
thus
i
took
the
excellence
of
the
italian
masters
more
on
trust
and
in
faith
than
by
pretending
to
any
insight
into
them
what
i
could
not
look
upon
as
nature
put
in
the
place
of
nature
and
compare
with
a
known
object
was
without
effect
upon
me
it
is
the
material
impression
which
makes
the
beginning
even
to
every
more
elevated
amateurship
with
my
shoemaker
i
lived
on
very
good
terms
he
was
witty
and
varied
enough
and
we
often
outvied
each
other
in
merry
conceits
nevertheless
a
man
who
thinks
himself
happy
and
desires
others
to
do
the
same
makes
us
discontented
indeed
the
repetition
of
such
sentiments
produces
weariness
i
found
myself
well
occupied
entertained
excited
but
by
no
means
happy
and
the
shoes
from
his
last
would
not
fit
me
we
parted
however
as
the
best
friends
and
even
my
hostess
on
my
departure
was
not
dissatisfied
with
me
shortly
before
my
departure
something
else
very
pleasant
was
to
happen
by
the
mediation
of
that
young
man
who
wished
to
restore
himself
to
some
credit
with
me
i
was
introduced
to
the
director
von
hagedorn
who
with
great
kindness
showed
me
his
collection
and
was
highly
delighted
with
the
enthusiasm
of
the
young
lover
of
art
he
himself
as
becomes
a
connoisseur
was
quite
peculiarly
in
love
with
the
pictures
which
he
possessed
and
therefore
seldom
found
in
others
an
interest
such
as
he
wished
it
gave
him
particular
satisfaction
that
i
was
beyond
measure
pleased
with
a
picture
by
schwanefeld
and
that
i
was
not
tired
of
praising
and
extolling
it
in
every
single
part
for
landscapes
which
again
reminded
me
of
the
beautiful
clear
sky
under
which
i
had
grown
up
the
vegetable
luxuriance
of
those
spots
and
of
whatever
other
favours
a
warmer
climate
offers
to
man
were
just
the
things
that
most
affected
me
in
the
imitation
while
they
awakened
in
me
a
longing
remembrance
state
of
dresden
these
precious
experiences
preparing
both
mind
and
sense
for
true
art
were
nevertheless
interrupted
and
damped
by
one
of
the
most
melancholy
sights
by
the
destroyed
and
desolate
condition
of
so
many
of
the
streets
of
dresden
through
which
i
took
my
way
the
mohrenstrasse
in
ruins
and
the
church
of
the
cross
with
its
shattered
tower
impressed
themselves
deeply
upon
me
and
still
stand
like
a
gloomy
spot
in
my
imagination
from
the
cupola
of
the
lady
church
i
saw
these
pitiable
ruins
scattered
about
amid
the
beautiful
order
of
the
city
here
the
clerk
commended
to
me
the
art
of
the
architect
who
had
already
fitted
up
church
and
cupola
for
so
undesirable
an
event
and
had
built
them
the
good
sacristan
then
pointed
out
to
me
the
ruins
sides
and
said
doubtfully
and
laconically
enemy
hath
done
this
now
then
at
last
though
unwillingly
i
returned
back
to
leipzig
and
found
my
friends
who
were
not
used
to
such
digressions
in
me
in
great
astonishment
busied
with
all
sorts
of
conjectures
as
to
what
might
be
the
import
of
my
mysterious
journey
when
upon
this
i
told
them
my
story
quite
in
order
they
declared
it
was
only
a
tale
and
sagaciously
tried
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
the
riddle
which
i
had
been
waggish
enough
to
conceal
under
my
but
could
they
have
looked
into
my
heart
they
would
have
discovered
no
waggery
there
for
the
truth
of
that
old
proverb
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
had
struck
me
with
all
its
force
and
the
more
i
struggled
to
arrange
and
appropriate
to
myself
what
i
had
seen
the
less
i
succeeded
i
had
at
last
to
content
myself
with
a
silent
ordinary
life
carried
me
away
again
and
i
at
last
felt
myself
quite
comfortable
when
a
friendly
intercourse
improvement
in
branches
of
knowledge
which
were
suitable
for
me
and
a
certain
practice
of
the
hand
engaged
me
in
a
manner
less
important
but
more
in
accordance
with
my
strength
very
pleasant
and
wholesome
for
me
was
the
connexion
which
i
formed
with
the
breitkopf
family
bernhard
christoph
breitkopf
the
proper
founder
of
the
family
who
had
come
to
leipzig
as
a
poor
journeyman
printer
was
yet
living
and
occupied
the
golden
bear
a
respectable
house
in
the
new
newmarket
with
gottsched
as
an
inmate
the
son
johann
gottlob
immanuel
had
already
been
long
married
and
was
the
father
of
many
children
they
thought
they
could
not
spend
a
part
of
their
considerable
wealth
better
than
in
putting
up
opposite
the
first
house
a
large
new
one
the
silver
bear
which
they
built
higher
and
more
extensive
than
the
original
house
itself
just
at
the
time
of
the
building
i
became
acquainted
with
the
family
the
eldest
son
might
have
been
some
years
older
than
i
was
a
young
man
devoted
to
music
and
practised
to
play
skilfully
on
both
the
piano
and
the
violin
the
second
a
true
good
soul
likewise
musical
enlivened
the
concerts
which
were
often
got
up
no
less
than
his
elder
brother
they
were
both
kindly
disposed
towards
me
as
well
as
their
parents
and
sisters
i
lent
them
a
during
the
building
up
and
the
finishing
the
furnishing
and
the
moving
in
and
thus
formed
a
conception
of
much
that
belongs
to
such
an
affair
i
also
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
oeser
instructions
put
in
practice
in
the
new
house
which
i
had
thus
seen
erected
i
was
often
a
visitor
we
had
many
pursuits
in
common
and
the
eldest
son
set
some
of
my
songs
to
music
which
when
printed
bore
his
name
but
not
mine
and
have
been
little
known
i
have
selected
the
best
and
inserted
them
among
my
other
little
poems
the
father
had
invented
or
perfected
musical
type
he
permitted
me
the
use
of
a
fine
library
which
related
principally
to
the
origin
and
progress
of
printing
and
thus
i
gained
some
knowledge
in
that
department
i
found
there
moreover
good
which
exhibited
antiquity
and
advanced
on
this
side
also
my
studies
which
were
still
further
promoted
by
the
circumstance
that
a
considerable
collection
of
casts
had
fallen
into
disorder
in
moving
i
set
them
right
again
as
well
as
i
could
and
in
doing
so
was
compelled
to
search
lippert
and
other
authorities
a
physician
doctor
reichel
likewise
an
inmate
of
the
house
i
consulted
from
time
to
time
when
i
felt
if
not
sick
yet
unwell
and
thus
we
led
together
a
quiet
pleasant
life
taste
for
etching
i
was
now
to
enter
into
another
sort
of
connexion
in
this
house
for
the
engraver
stock
had
moved
into
the
attic
he
was
a
native
of
nuremberg
a
very
industrious
man
and
in
his
labours
precise
and
methodical
he
also
like
geyser
engraved
after
designs
larger
and
smaller
plates
which
came
more
and
more
into
vogue
for
novels
and
poems
he
etched
very
neatly
so
that
his
work
came
out
of
the
aquafortis
almost
finished
and
but
little
remained
to
be
done
with
the
graver
which
he
handled
very
well
he
made
an
exact
calculation
how
long
a
plate
would
occupy
him
and
nothing
could
call
him
off
from
his
work
if
he
had
not
completed
the
daily
task
he
had
set
himself
thus
he
sat
at
a
broad
by
the
in
a
very
neat
and
orderly
chamber
where
his
wife
and
two
daughters
afforded
him
a
domestic
society
of
these
last
one
is
happily
married
and
the
other
is
an
excellent
artist
they
have
continued
my
friends
all
my
life
long
i
now
divided
my
time
between
the
upper
and
lower
stories
and
attached
myself
much
to
the
man
who
together
with
his
persevering
industry
possessed
an
excellent
humour
and
was
itself
the
technical
neatness
of
this
branch
of
art
charmed
me
and
i
associated
myself
with
him
to
execute
something
of
the
kind
my
predilection
was
again
directed
towards
landscape
which
while
it
amused
me
in
my
solitary
walks
seemed
in
itself
more
attainable
and
more
comprehensible
for
works
of
art
than
the
human
figure
which
discouraged
me
under
his
directions
therefore
i
etched
after
thiele
and
others
various
landscapes
which
although
executed
by
an
unpractised
hand
produced
some
effect
and
were
well
received
the
grounding
varnishing
of
the
plates
the
putting
in
the
high
lights
the
etching
and
at
last
the
biting
with
aquafortis
gave
me
variety
of
occupation
and
i
soon
got
so
far
that
i
could
assist
my
master
in
many
things
i
did
not
lack
the
attention
necessary
for
the
biting
and
i
seldom
failed
in
anything
but
i
had
not
care
enough
in
guarding
against
the
deleterious
vapours
which
are
generated
on
such
occasions
and
these
may
have
contributed
to
the
maladies
which
afterwards
troubled
me
for
a
long
time
amidst
such
labours
that
everything
might
be
tried
i
often
made
also
i
prepared
various
little
after
french
patterns
and
many
of
them
were
found
fit
for
use
let
me
here
make
mention
of
some
other
men
who
resided
in
leipzig
or
tarried
there
for
a
short
time
weisse
the
collector
of
the
district
in
his
best
years
cheerful
friendly
and
obliging
was
loved
and
esteemed
by
us
we
would
not
indeed
allow
his
theatrical
pieces
to
be
models
throughout
but
we
suffered
ourselves
to
be
carried
away
by
them
and
his
operas
set
to
music
by
hiller
in
an
easy
style
gave
us
much
pleasure
schiebler
of
hamburgh
pursued
the
same
track
and
his
and
was
likewise
favoured
by
us
eschenburg
a
handsome
young
man
but
little
older
than
we
were
distinguished
himself
advantageously
among
the
students
zachariæ
was
pleased
to
spend
some
weeks
with
us
and
being
introduced
by
his
brother
dined
every
day
with
us
at
the
same
table
we
rightly
deemed
it
an
honour
to
gratify
our
guest
in
return
by
a
few
extra
dishes
a
richer
dessert
and
choicer
wine
for
as
a
tall
comfortable
man
he
did
not
conceal
his
love
of
good
eating
lessing
came
at
a
time
when
we
had
i
know
not
what
in
our
heads
it
was
our
good
pleasure
to
go
nowhere
on
his
account
nay
even
to
avoid
the
places
to
which
he
came
probably
because
we
thought
ourselves
too
good
to
stand
at
a
distance
and
could
make
no
pretension
to
obtain
a
closer
intimacy
with
him
this
momentary
absurdity
which
however
is
nothing
rare
in
presuming
and
freakish
youth
proved
indeed
its
own
punishment
in
the
sequel
for
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
that
eminent
man
who
was
most
highly
esteemed
by
me
notwithstanding
all
our
efforts
relative
to
art
and
antiquity
we
each
of
us
always
had
winckelmann
before
our
eves
whose
ability
was
acknowledged
in
his
fatherland
with
enthusiasm
we
read
his
writings
diligently
and
tried
to
make
ourselves
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
under
which
he
had
written
the
first
of
them
we
found
in
them
many
views
which
seemed
to
have
originated
with
oeser
even
jests
and
whims
after
his
fashion
and
we
did
not
rest
until
we
had
formed
some
general
conception
of
the
occasion
on
which
these
remarkable
and
sometimes
so
enigmatical
writings
had
arisen
though
we
were
not
very
accurate
for
youth
likes
better
to
be
excited
than
instructed
and
it
was
not
the
last
time
that
i
was
to
be
indebted
to
sibylline
leaves
for
an
important
step
in
cultivation
death
of
winckelmann
it
was
then
a
fine
period
in
literature
when
eminent
men
were
yet
treated
with
respect
although
the
disputes
of
klotz
and
controversies
already
indicated
that
this
epoch
would
soon
close
winckelmann
enjoyed
an
universal
unassailed
reverence
and
it
is
known
how
sensitive
he
was
with
regard
to
anything
public
which
did
not
seem
commensurate
with
his
deeply
felt
dignity
all
the
periodical
publications
joined
in
his
praise
the
better
class
of
tourists
came
back
from
him
instructed
and
enraptured
and
the
new
views
which
he
gave
extended
themselves
over
science
and
life
the
prince
of
dessau
had
raised
himself
up
to
a
similar
degree
of
respect
young
well
and
nobly
minded
he
had
on
his
travels
and
at
other
times
shown
himself
truly
desirable
winckelmann
was
in
the
highest
degree
delighted
with
him
and
whenever
he
mentioned
him
loaded
him
with
the
handsomest
epithets
the
laying
out
of
a
park
then
unique
the
taste
for
architecture
which
von
erdmannsdorf
supported
by
his
activity
everything
spoke
in
favour
of
a
prince
who
while
he
was
a
shining
example
for
the
rest
gave
promise
of
a
golden
age
for
his
servants
and
subjects
we
young
people
now
learned
with
rejoicings
that
winckelmann
would
return
back
from
italy
visit
his
princely
friend
call
on
oeser
by
the
way
and
so
come
within
our
sphere
of
vision
we
made
no
pretensions
to
speaking
with
him
but
we
hoped
to
see
him
and
as
at
that
time
of
life
one
willingly
changes
every
occasion
into
a
party
of
pleasure
we
had
already
agreed
upon
a
journey
to
dessau
where
in
a
beautiful
spot
made
glorious
by
art
in
a
land
well
governed
and
at
the
same
time
externally
adorned
we
thought
to
lie
in
wait
now
here
now
there
in
order
to
see
with
our
own
eyes
these
men
so
highly
exalted
above
us
walking
about
oeser
himself
was
quite
elated
if
he
only
thought
of
it
and
the
news
of
winckelmann
death
fell
down
into
the
midst
of
us
like
a
thunderbolt
from
a
clear
sky
i
still
remember
the
place
where
i
first
heard
it
it
was
in
the
court
of
the
pleissenburg
not
far
from
the
little
gate
through
which
one
used
to
go
up
to
oeser
residence
one
of
my
met
me
and
told
me
that
oeser
was
not
to
be
seen
with
the
reason
why
this
monstrous
event
produced
a
monstrous
effect
there
was
an
universal
mourning
and
lamentation
and
winckelmann
untimely
death
sharpened
the
attention
paid
to
the
value
of
his
life
perhaps
indeed
the
effect
of
his
activity
if
he
had
continued
it
to
a
more
advanced
age
would
probably
not
have
been
so
great
as
it
now
necessarily
became
when
like
many
other
extraordinary
men
he
was
distinguished
by
fate
through
a
strange
and
calamitous
end
now
while
i
was
infinitely
lamenting
the
death
of
winckelmann
i
did
not
think
that
i
should
soon
find
myself
in
the
case
of
being
apprehensive
about
my
own
life
since
during
all
these
events
my
bodily
condition
had
not
taken
the
most
favourable
turn
i
had
already
brought
with
me
from
home
a
certain
touch
of
hypochondria
which
in
this
new
sedentary
and
lounging
life
was
rather
strengthened
than
diminished
the
pain
in
the
breast
which
i
had
felt
from
time
to
time
ever
since
the
accident
at
auerstädt
and
which
after
a
fall
from
horseback
had
perceptibly
increased
made
me
dejected
by
an
unfortunate
diet
i
destroyed
my
powers
of
digestion
the
heavy
merseburg
beer
clouded
my
brain
the
coffee
which
gave
me
a
peculiarly
melancholy
tone
especially
when
taken
with
milk
after
dinner
paralysed
my
bowels
and
seemed
completely
to
suspend
their
functions
so
that
i
experienced
great
uneasiness
on
this
account
yet
without
being
able
to
embrace
a
resolution
for
a
more
rational
mode
of
life
my
natural
disposition
supported
by
the
sufficient
strength
of
youth
fluctuated
between
the
extremes
of
unrestrained
gaiety
and
melancholy
discomfort
besides
this
the
epoch
of
the
cold
water
bath
which
was
unconditionally
recommended
had
then
begun
one
was
to
sleep
on
a
hard
bed
only
slightly
covered
by
which
all
the
usual
perspiration
was
suppressed
these
and
other
follies
in
consequence
of
some
misunderstood
suggestions
of
rousseau
would
it
was
promised
bring
us
nearer
to
nature
and
deliver
us
from
the
corruption
of
morals
now
all
the
above
without
discrimination
applied
with
injudicious
alternation
were
felt
by
many
most
injuriously
and
i
irritated
my
happy
organization
to
such
a
degree
that
the
particular
systems
contained
within
it
necessarily
broke
out
at
last
into
a
conspiracy
and
revolution
in
order
to
save
the
whole
one
night
i
awoke
with
a
violent
hæmorrhage
and
had
just
strength
and
presence
of
mind
enough
to
waken
my
next
room
neighbour
reichel
was
called
in
who
assisted
me
in
the
most
friendly
manner
and
thus
for
many
days
i
wavered
betwixt
life
and
death
and
even
the
joy
of
a
subsequent
improvement
was
embittered
by
the
circumstance
that
during
that
eruption
a
tumour
had
formed
on
the
left
side
of
the
neck
which
after
the
danger
was
past
they
now
first
found
time
to
notice
recovery
is
however
always
pleasing
and
delightful
even
though
it
takes
place
slowly
and
painfully
and
since
nature
had
helped
herself
with
me
i
appeared
now
to
have
become
another
man
for
i
had
gained
a
greater
cheerfulness
of
mind
than
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
and
i
was
rejoiced
to
feel
my
inner
self
at
liberty
although
externally
a
wearisome
affliction
threatened
me
but
what
particularly
set
me
up
at
this
time
was
to
see
how
many
eminent
men
had
undeservedly
given
me
their
affection
undeservedly
i
say
for
there
was
not
one
among
them
to
whom
i
had
not
been
troublesome
through
contradictory
humours
not
one
whom
i
had
not
more
than
once
wounded
by
morbid
absurdity
nay
whom
i
had
not
stubbornly
avoided
for
a
long
time
from
a
feeling
of
my
own
injustice
all
this
was
forgotten
they
treated
me
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
and
sought
partly
in
my
chamber
partly
as
soon
as
i
could
leave
it
to
amuse
and
divert
me
they
drove
out
with
me
entertained
me
at
their
and
i
seemed
soon
to
recover
dr
hermann
among
these
friends
i
name
first
of
all
doctor
hermann
then
senator
afterwards
burgomaster
of
leipzig
he
was
among
those
boarders
with
whom
i
had
become
acquainted
through
schlosser
the
one
with
whom
an
always
equable
and
enduring
connexion
was
maintained
one
might
well
reckon
him
the
most
industrious
of
his
academical
he
attended
his
lectures
with
the
greatest
regularity
and
his
private
industry
remained
always
the
same
step
by
step
without
the
slightest
deviation
i
saw
him
attain
his
doctor
degree
and
then
raise
himself
to
the
assessorship
without
anything
of
all
this
appearing
arduous
to
him
or
his
having
in
the
least
hurried
or
been
too
late
with
anything
the
gentleness
of
his
character
attracted
me
his
instructive
conversation
held
me
fast
indeed
i
really
believe
that
i
took
delight
in
his
methodical
industry
especially
for
this
reason
because
i
thought
by
acknowledgments
and
high
esteem
to
appropriate
to
myself
at
least
a
part
of
a
merit
of
which
i
could
by
no
means
boast
he
was
just
as
regular
in
the
exercise
of
his
talents
and
the
enjoyment
of
his
pleasures
as
in
his
business
he
played
the
harpsichord
with
great
skill
drew
from
nature
with
feeling
and
stimulated
me
to
do
the
same
when
in
his
manner
on
grey
paper
and
with
black
and
white
chalk
i
used
to
copy
many
a
on
the
pleisse
and
many
a
lovely
nook
of
those
still
waters
and
at
the
same
time
longingly
to
indulge
in
my
fancies
he
knew
how
to
meet
my
sometimes
comical
disposition
with
merry
jests
and
i
remember
many
pleasant
hours
which
we
spent
together
when
he
invited
me
with
mock
solemnity
to
a
supper
where
with
some
dignity
by
the
light
of
waxen
candles
we
ate
what
they
call
a
which
had
run
into
his
kitchen
as
a
perquisite
of
his
place
and
with
many
jokes
in
the
manner
of
behrisch
were
pleased
to
season
the
meat
and
heighten
the
spirit
of
the
wine
that
this
excellent
man
who
is
still
constantly
labouring
in
his
respectable
office
rendered
me
the
most
faithful
assistance
during
a
disease
of
which
there
was
indeed
a
foreboding
but
which
had
not
been
foreseen
in
its
full
extent
that
he
bestowed
every
leisure
hour
upon
me
and
by
remembrances
of
former
happy
times
contrived
to
brighten
the
gloomy
moment
i
still
acknowledge
with
the
sincerest
thanks
and
rejoice
that
after
so
long
a
time
i
can
give
them
publicly
besides
this
worthy
friend
groening
of
bremen
particularly
interested
himself
in
me
i
had
made
his
acquaintance
only
a
short
time
before
and
first
discovered
his
good
feeling
towards
me
during
my
misfortune
i
felt
the
value
of
this
favour
the
more
warmly
as
no
one
is
apt
to
seek
a
closer
connexion
with
invalids
he
spared
nothing
to
give
me
pleasure
to
draw
me
away
from
musing
on
my
situation
to
hold
up
to
my
view
and
promise
me
recovery
and
a
wholesome
activity
in
the
nearest
future
how
often
have
i
been
delighted
in
the
progress
of
life
to
hear
how
this
excellent
man
has
in
the
weightiest
affairs
shown
himself
useful
and
indeed
a
blessing
to
his
native
city
here
too
it
was
that
friend
horn
uninterruptedly
brought
into
action
his
love
and
attention
the
whole
breitkopf
household
the
stock
family
and
many
others
treated
me
like
a
near
relative
and
thus
through
the
of
so
many
friendly
persons
the
feeling
of
my
situation
was
soothed
in
the
tenderest
manner
langer
i
must
here
however
make
particular
mention
of
a
man
with
whom
i
first
became
acquainted
at
this
time
and
whose
instructive
conversation
so
far
blinded
me
to
the
miserable
state
in
which
i
was
that
i
actually
forgot
it
this
was
langer
afterwards
librarian
at
wolfenbüttel
eminently
learned
and
instructed
he
was
delighted
at
my
voracious
hunger
after
knowledge
which
with
the
irritability
of
sickness
now
broke
out
into
a
perfect
fever
he
tried
to
calm
me
by
perspicuous
summaries
and
i
have
been
very
much
indebted
to
his
acquaintance
short
as
it
was
since
he
understood
how
to
guide
me
in
various
ways
and
made
me
attentive
whither
i
had
to
direct
myself
at
the
present
moment
i
found
myself
the
more
obliged
to
this
important
man
as
my
intercourse
exposed
him
to
some
danger
for
when
after
behrisch
he
got
the
situation
of
tutor
to
the
young
count
lindenau
the
father
made
it
an
express
condition
with
the
new
mentor
that
he
should
have
no
intercourse
with
me
curious
to
become
acquainted
with
such
a
dangerous
subject
he
frequently
found
means
of
meeting
me
indirectly
i
soon
gained
his
affection
and
he
more
prudent
than
behrisch
called
for
me
by
night
we
went
walking
together
conversed
on
interesting
things
and
at
last
i
accompanied
him
to
the
very
door
of
his
mistress
for
even
this
externally
severe
earnest
scientific
man
had
not
kept
free
from
the
toils
of
a
very
amiable
lady
german
literature
and
with
it
my
own
poetical
undertakings
had
already
for
some
time
become
strange
to
me
and
as
is
usually
the
result
in
such
an
circular
course
i
turned
back
towards
the
beloved
ancients
who
still
constantly
like
distant
blue
mountains
distinct
in
their
outlines
and
masses
but
indiscernible
in
their
parts
and
internal
relations
bounded
the
horizon
of
my
intellectual
wishes
i
made
an
exchange
with
langer
in
which
i
at
last
played
the
part
of
glaucus
and
diomedes
i
gave
up
to
him
whole
baskets
of
german
poets
and
critics
and
received
in
return
a
number
of
greek
authors
the
reading
of
whom
was
to
give
me
recreation
even
during
the
most
tedious
convalescence
the
confidence
which
new
friends
repose
in
each
other
usually
developes
itself
by
degrees
common
occupation
and
tastes
are
the
first
things
in
which
a
mutual
harmony
shows
itself
then
the
mutual
communication
generally
extends
over
past
and
present
passions
especially
over
love
affairs
but
it
is
a
lower
depth
which
opens
itself
if
the
connexion
is
to
be
perfected
the
religious
sentiments
the
affairs
of
the
heart
which
relate
to
the
imperishable
are
the
things
which
both
establish
the
foundation
and
adorn
the
summit
of
a
friendship
the
christian
religion
was
wavering
between
its
own
historically
positive
base
and
a
pure
deism
which
grounded
on
morality
was
in
its
turn
to
lay
the
foundation
of
ethics
the
diversity
of
characters
and
modes
of
thought
here
showed
itself
in
infinite
gradations
especially
when
a
leading
difference
was
brought
into
play
by
the
question
arising
as
to
how
great
a
share
the
reason
and
how
great
a
share
the
feelings
could
and
should
bear
a
part
in
such
convictions
the
most
lively
and
ingenious
men
showed
themselves
in
this
instance
like
butterflies
who
quite
regardless
of
their
caterpillar
state
throw
away
the
chrysalis
veil
in
which
they
have
grown
up
to
their
organic
perfection
others
more
honestly
and
modestly
minded
might
be
compared
to
the
flowers
which
although
they
unfold
themselves
to
the
most
beautiful
bloom
yet
do
not
tear
themselves
from
the
root
from
the
mother
stalk
nay
rather
through
this
family
connexion
first
bring
the
desired
fruit
to
maturity
of
this
latter
class
was
langer
for
although
a
learned
man
and
eminently
versed
in
books
he
would
yet
give
the
bible
a
peculiar
over
the
other
writings
which
have
come
down
to
us
and
regard
it
as
a
document
from
which
alone
we
could
prove
our
moral
and
spiritual
pedigree
he
belonged
to
those
who
can
not
conceive
an
immediate
connexion
with
the
great
god
of
the
universe
a
mediation
therefore
was
necessary
for
him
an
analogy
to
which
he
thought
he
could
find
everywhere
in
earthly
and
heavenly
things
his
discourse
which
was
pleasing
and
consistent
easily
found
a
hearing
with
a
young
man
who
separated
from
worldly
things
by
an
annoying
illness
found
it
highly
desirable
to
turn
the
activity
of
his
mind
towards
the
heavenly
grounded
as
i
was
in
the
bible
all
that
was
wanted
was
merely
the
faith
to
explain
as
divine
that
which
i
had
hitherto
esteemed
in
human
a
belief
the
easier
for
me
since
i
had
made
my
first
acquaintance
with
that
book
as
a
divine
one
to
a
sufferer
to
one
who
felt
himself
delicate
nay
weak
the
gospel
was
therefore
welcome
and
even
though
langer
with
all
his
faith
was
at
the
same
time
a
very
sensible
man
and
firmly
maintained
that
one
should
not
let
the
feelings
prevail
should
not
let
oneself
be
led
astray
into
mysticism
i
could
not
have
managed
to
occupy
myself
with
the
new
testament
without
feeling
and
enthusiasm
in
such
conversations
we
spent
much
time
and
he
grew
so
fond
of
me
as
an
honest
and
proselyte
that
he
did
not
scruple
to
sacrifice
to
me
many
of
the
hours
destined
for
his
fair
one
and
even
to
run
the
risk
of
being
betrayed
and
looked
upon
unfavourably
by
his
patron
like
behrisch
i
returned
his
affection
in
the
most
grateful
manner
and
if
what
he
did
for
me
would
have
been
of
value
at
any
time
i
could
not
but
regard
it
in
my
present
condition
as
worthy
of
the
highest
honour
riot
at
leipzig
but
as
when
the
concert
of
our
souls
is
most
spiritually
attuned
the
rude
shrieking
tones
of
the
world
usually
break
in
most
violently
and
boisterously
and
the
contrast
which
has
gone
on
exercising
a
secret
control
affects
us
so
much
the
more
sensibly
when
it
comes
forward
all
at
once
thus
was
i
not
to
be
dismissed
from
the
peripatetic
school
of
my
langer
without
having
first
witnessed
an
event
strange
at
least
for
leipzig
namely
a
tumult
which
the
students
excited
and
that
on
the
following
pretence
some
young
people
had
quarrelled
with
the
city
soldiers
and
the
affair
had
not
gone
off
without
violence
many
of
the
students
combined
together
to
revenge
the
injuries
inflicted
the
soldiers
resisted
stubbornly
and
the
advantage
was
not
on
the
side
of
the
very
discontented
academical
citizens
it
was
now
said
that
respectable
persons
had
commended
and
rewarded
the
conquerors
for
their
valiant
resistance
and
by
this
the
youthful
feeling
of
honour
and
revenge
was
mightily
excited
it
was
publicly
said
that
on
the
next
evening
windows
would
be
broken
in
and
some
friends
who
brought
me
word
that
this
was
actually
taking
place
were
obliged
to
carry
me
there
for
youth
and
the
multitude
are
always
attracted
by
danger
and
tumult
there
really
began
a
strange
spectacle
the
otherwise
open
street
was
lined
on
one
side
with
men
who
quite
quiet
without
noise
or
movement
were
waiting
to
see
what
would
happen
about
a
dozen
young
fellows
were
walking
singly
up
and
down
the
empty
with
the
greatest
apparent
composure
but
as
soon
as
they
came
opposite
the
marked
house
they
threw
stones
at
the
windows
as
they
passed
by
and
this
repeatedly
as
they
returned
backwards
and
forwards
as
long
as
the
panes
would
rattle
just
as
quietly
as
this
was
done
all
at
last
dispersed
and
the
affair
had
no
further
consequences
with
such
a
ringing
echo
of
university
exploits
i
left
leipzig
in
the
september
of
in
a
comfortable
hired
coach
and
in
the
company
of
some
respectable
persons
of
my
acquaintance
in
the
neighbourhood
of
auerstädt
i
thought
of
that
previous
accident
but
i
could
not
forebode
that
which
many
years
afterwards
would
threaten
me
from
thence
with
still
greater
danger
just
as
little
as
in
gotha
where
we
had
the
castle
shown
to
us
i
could
think
in
the
great
hall
adorned
with
stucco
figures
that
so
much
favour
and
affection
would
befall
me
on
that
very
spot
the
nearer
i
approached
my
native
city
the
more
i
recalled
to
myself
doubtingly
the
circumstances
prospects
and
hopes
with
which
i
had
left
home
and
it
was
a
very
disheartening
feeling
that
i
now
returned
as
it
were
like
one
shipwrecked
yet
since
i
had
not
very
much
with
which
to
reproach
myself
i
contrived
to
compose
myself
tolerably
well
however
the
welcome
was
not
without
emotion
the
great
vivacity
of
my
nature
excited
and
heightened
by
sickness
caused
an
impassioned
scene
i
might
have
looked
worse
than
i
myself
knew
since
for
a
long
time
i
had
not
consulted
a
and
who
does
not
become
used
to
himself
enough
they
silently
resolved
to
communicate
many
things
to
me
only
by
degrees
and
before
all
things
to
let
me
have
some
repose
both
bodily
and
mental
state
of
goethe
family
my
sister
immediately
associated
herself
with
me
and
as
previously
from
her
letters
so
i
could
now
more
in
detail
and
accurately
understand
the
circumstances
and
situation
of
the
family
my
father
had
after
my
departure
concentrated
all
his
didactic
taste
upon
my
sister
and
in
a
house
completely
shut
up
rendered
secure
by
peace
and
even
cleared
of
lodgers
he
had
cut
off
from
her
almost
every
means
of
looking
about
and
recreating
herself
abroad
she
had
by
turns
to
pursue
and
work
at
french
italian
and
english
besides
which
he
compelled
her
to
practise
a
great
part
of
the
day
on
the
harpsichord
her
writing
also
could
not
be
neglected
and
i
had
already
remarked
that
he
had
directed
her
correspondence
with
me
and
had
let
his
doctrines
come
to
me
through
her
pen
my
sister
was
and
still
continued
to
be
an
undefinable
being
the
most
singular
mixture
of
strength
and
weakness
of
stubbornness
and
pliability
which
qualities
operated
now
united
now
isolated
by
will
and
inclination
thus
she
had
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
me
fearful
turned
the
hardness
of
her
character
against
her
father
whom
she
did
not
forgive
for
having
hindered
or
embittered
to
her
so
many
innocent
joys
for
these
three
years
and
of
his
good
and
excellent
qualities
she
would
not
acknowledge
even
one
she
did
all
that
he
commanded
and
arranged
but
in
the
most
unamiable
manner
in
the
world
she
did
it
in
the
established
routine
but
nothing
more
and
nothing
less
from
love
or
a
desire
to
please
she
accommodated
herself
to
nothing
so
that
this
was
one
of
the
first
things
about
which
my
mother
complained
in
a
private
conversation
with
me
but
since
love
was
as
essential
to
my
sister
as
to
any
human
being
she
turned
her
affection
wholly
on
me
her
care
in
nursing
and
entertaining
me
absorbed
all
her
time
her
female
companions
who
were
swayed
by
her
without
her
intending
it
had
likewise
to
contrive
all
sorts
of
things
to
be
pleasing
and
consolatory
to
me
she
was
inventive
in
cheering
me
up
and
even
developed
some
germs
of
comical
humour
which
i
had
never
known
in
her
and
which
became
her
very
well
there
soon
arose
between
us
a
by
which
we
could
converse
before
all
people
without
their
understanding
us
and
she
often
used
this
gibberish
with
great
pertness
in
the
presence
of
our
parents
my
father
was
personally
in
tolerable
comfort
he
was
in
good
health
spent
a
great
part
of
the
day
in
the
instruction
of
my
sister
wrote
at
the
description
of
his
travels
and
was
longer
in
tuning
his
lute
than
in
playing
on
it
he
concealed
at
the
same
time
as
well
as
he
could
his
vexation
at
finding
instead
of
a
stout
active
son
who
ought
now
to
take
his
degree
and
run
through
the
prescribed
course
of
life
an
invalid
who
seemed
to
suffer
still
more
in
soul
than
in
body
he
did
not
conceal
his
wish
that
they
would
be
expeditious
with
my
cure
but
one
was
forced
to
be
specially
on
one
guard
in
his
presence
against
hypochondriacal
expressions
because
he
could
then
become
passionate
and
bitter

very
lively
and
cheerful
spent
under
these
circumstances
very
tedious
days
her
little
housekeeping
was
soon
provided
for
the
mind
of
the
good
lady
internally
never
unoccupied
wished
to
find
an
interest
in
something
and
that
which
was
nearest
at
hand
was
religion
which
she
embraced
the
more
fondly
as
her
most
eminent
female
friends
were
cultivated
and
hearty
worshippers
of
god
at
the
head
of
these
stood
fräulein
von
klettenberg
she
is
the
same
person
from
whose
conversations
and
letters
arose
the
confessions
of
a
beautiful
soul
which
are
found
inserted
in
wilhelm
meister
she
was
slenderly
formed
of
the
middle
size
a
hearty
natural
demeanour
had
been
made
still
more
pleasing
by
the
manners
of
the
world
and
the
court
her
very
neat
attire
reminded
of
the
dress
of
the
hernhutt
ladies
her
serenity
and
peace
of
mind
never
left
her
she
looked
upon
her
sickness
as
a
necessary
element
of
her
transient
earthly
existence
she
suffered
with
the
greatest
patience
and
in
painless
intervals
was
lively
and
talkative
her
favourite
nay
indeed
perhaps
her
only
conversation
was
on
the
moral
experiences
which
a
man
who
observes
himself
can
form
in
himself
to
which
was
added
the
religious
views
which
in
a
very
graceful
manner
nay
with
genius
came
under
her
consideration
as
natural
and
supernatural
it
scarcely
needs
more
to
recall
back
to
the
friends
of
such
representations
that
complete
delineation
composed
from
the
very
depths
of
her
soul
owing
to
the
very
peculiar
course
which
she
had
taken
from
her
youth
upwards
the
distinguished
rank
in
which
she
had
been
born
and
educated
and
the
liveliness
and
originality
of
her
mind
she
did
not
agree
very
well
with
the
other
ladies
who
had
set
out
on
the
same
road
to
salvation
frau
griesbach
the
chief
of
them
seemed
too
severe
too
dry
too
learned
she
knew
thought
comprehended
more
than
the
others
who
contented
themselves
with
the
development
of
their
feelings
and
she
was
therefore
burdensome
to
them
because
every
one
neither
could
nor
would
carry
with
her
so
great
an
apparatus
on
the
road
to
bliss
but
for
this
reason
the
most
of
them
were
indeed
somewhat
monotonous
since
they
confined
themselves
to
a
certain
terminology
which
might
well
have
been
compared
to
that
of
the
later
sentimentalists
fräulein
von
klettenberg
led
her
way
between
both
extremes
and
seemed
with
some
to
see
her
own
reflection
in
the
image
of
count
zinzendorf
whose
opinions
and
actions
bore
witness
to
a
higher
birth
and
more
distinguished
rank
now
she
found
in
me
what
she
needed
a
lively
young
creature
striving
after
an
unknown
happiness
who
although
he
could
not
think
himself
an
extraordinary
sinner
yet
found
himself
in
no
comfortable
condition
and
was
perfectly
healthy
neither
in
body
nor
soul
she
was
delighted
with
what
nature
had
given
me
as
well
as
with
much
which
i
had
gained
for
myself
and
if
she
conceded
to
me
many
advantages
this
was
by
no
means
humiliating
to
her
for
in
the
first
place
she
never
thought
of
emulating
one
of
the
male
sex
and
secondly
she
believed
that
in
regard
to
religious
culture
she
was
very
much
in
advance
of
me
my
disquiet
my
impatience
my
striving
my
seeking
investigating
musing
and
wavering
she
interpreted
in
her
own
way
and
did
not
conceal
from
me
her
conviction
but
assured
me
in
plain
terms
that
all
this
proceeded
from
my
having
no
reconciled
god
now
i
had
believed
from
my
youth
upwards
that
i
stood
on
very
good
terms
with
my
god
nay
i
even
fancied
to
myself
according
to
various
experiences
that
he
might
even
be
in
arrears
to
me
and
i
was
daring
enough
to
think
that
i
had
something
to
forgive
him
this
presumption
was
grounded
on
my
infinite
to
which
as
it
seemed
to
me
he
should
have
given
better
assistance
it
may
be
imagined
how
often
i
and
my
female
friend
fell
into
disputes
on
this
subject
which
however
always
terminated
in
the
friendliest
way
and
often
like
my
conversations
with
the
old
rector
with
the
remark
that
i
was
a
foolish
fellow
for
whom
many
allowances
must
be
made
i
was
much
troubled
with
the
tumour
in
my
neck
as
the
physician
and
surgeon
wished
first
to
disperse
this
excrescence
afterwards
as
they
said
to
draw
it
to
a
head
and
at
last
thought
good
to
open
it
so
for
a
long
time
i
had
to
sutler
more
from
inconvenience
than
pain
although
towards
the
end
of
the
cure
the
continual
touching
with
lunar
caustic
and
other
corrosive
substances
could
not
but
give
me
very
disagreeable
prospects
for
every
fresh
day
the
physician
and
surgeon
both
belonged
to
the
pious
separatists
although
both
were
of
highly
different
natural
characters
the
surgeon
a
slender
man
of
easy
and
skilful
hand
was
unfortunately
somewhat
hectic
but
endured
his
condition
with
truly
christian
patience
and
did
not
suffer
his
disease
to
perplex
him
in
his
profession
the
physician
was
an
inexplicable
and
moreover
abstruse
man
who
had
gained
himself
quite
a
peculiar
confidence
in
the
pious
circle
active
and
attentive
he
was
consoling
to
the
sick
but
more
than
by
all
this
he
extended
his
practice
by
the
gift
of
showing
in
the
background
some
mysterious
medicines
prepared
by
himself
of
which
no
one
could
speak
since
with
us
the
physicians
were
strictly
prohibited
from
making
up
their
own
prescriptions
with
certain
powders
which
may
have
been
some
kind
of
digestive
he
was
not
so
reserved
but
that
powerful
salt
which
could
only
be
applied
in
the
greatest
danger
was
only
mentioned
among
believers
although
no
one
had
yet
seen
it
or
traced
its
effects
to
excite
and
strengthen
our
faith
in
the
possibility
of
such
an
universal
remedy
the
physician
wherever
he
found
any
susceptibility
had
recommended
certain
books
to
his
patients
and
given
them
to
understand
that
by
one
own
study
of
them
one
could
well
attain
this
treasure
for
oneself
which
was
the
more
necessary
as
the
mode
of
its
preparation
both
for
physical
and
especially
for
moral
reasons
could
not
be
well
communicated
nay
that
in
order
to
comprehend
produce
and
use
this
great
work
one
must
know
the
secrets
of
nature
in
connexion
since
it
was
not
a
particular
but
an
universal
remedy
and
could
indeed
be
produced
under
different
forms
and
shapes
my
friend
had
listened
to
these
enticing
words
the
health
of
the
body
was
too
nearly
allied
to
the
health
of
the
soul
and
could
a
greater
benefit
a
greater
mercy
be
shown
towards
others
than
by
appropriating
to
oneself
a
remedy
by
which
so
many
sufferings
could
be
assuaged
so
many
a
danger
averted
she
had
already
secretly
studied
welling
for
which
however
as
the
author
himself
immediately
darkens
and
removes
the
light
he
imparts
she
was
looking
about
for
a
friend
who
in
this
alternation
of
glare
and
gloom
might
bear
her
company
it
needed
small
incitement
to
inoculate
me
also
with
this
disease
i
procured
the
work
which
like
all
writings
of
this
kind
could
trace
its
pedigree
in
a
direct
line
up
to
the
school
my
chief
labour
in
this
book
was
most
accurately
to
notice
the
dark
hints
by
which
the
author
refers
from
one
passage
to
another
and
thus
promises
to
reveal
what
he
conceals
and
to
mark
down
on
the
margin
the
number
of
the
page
where
such
passages
as
should
explain
each
other
were
to
be
found
but
even
thus
the
book
still
remained
dark
and
unintelligible
enough
except
that
one
at
last
studied
oneself
into
a
certain
terminology
and
by
using
it
according
to
one
own
fancy
believed
that
one
was
at
any
rate
saying
if
not
understanding
something
the
work
makes
very
honourable
mention
of
its
predecessors
and
we
were
incited
to
investigate
those
original
sources
themselves
we
turned
to
the
works
of
theophrastus
paracelsus
and
basilius
valentinus
as
well
as
to
those
of
helmont
starkey
and
others
whose
doctrines
and
directions
resting
more
or
less
on
nature
and
imagination
we
endeavoured
to
see
into
and
follow
out
i
was
particularly
pleased
with
the
catena
in
which
nature
though
perhaps
in
fantastical
fashion
is
represented
in
a
beautiful
combination
and
thus
sometimes
by
ourselves
sometimes
together
we
employed
much
time
on
these
singularities
and
spent
the
evenings
of
a
long
winter
during
which
i
was
compelled
to
keep
my
chamber
very
agreeably
since
we
three
my
mother
being
included
were
more
delighted
with
these
secrets
than
we
could
have
been
at
their
elucidation
alchemical
turn
in
the
meantime
a
very
severe
trial
was
preparing
for
me
for
a
disturbed
and
one
might
even
say
for
certain
moments
destroyed
digestion
excited
such
symptoms
that
in
great
tribulation
i
thought
i
should
lose
my
life
and
none
of
the
remedies
applied
would
produce
any
further
effect
in
this
last
extremity
my
distressed
mother
constrained
the
embarrassed
physician
with
the
greatest
vehemence
to
come
out
with
his
universal
medicine
after
a
long
refusal
he
hastened
home
at
the
dead
of
night
and
returned
with
a
little
glass
of
crystallized
dry
salt
which
was
dissolved
in
water
and
swallowed
by
the
patient
it
had
a
decidedly
alkaline
taste
the
salt
was
scarcely
taken
than
my
situation
appeared
relieved
and
from
that
moment
the
disease
took
a
turn
which
by
degrees
led
to
my
recovery
i
can
not
say
how
far
this
strengthened
and
enhanced
our
faith
in
our
physician
and
our
industry
to
make
ourselves
partakers
of
such
a
treasure
my
friend
who
without
parents
or
brothers
and
sisters
lived
in
a
large
house
had
already
before
this
begun
to
purchase
herself
a
little
alembics
and
retorts
of
moderate
size
and
in
accordance
with
the
hints
of
welling
and
the
significant
signs
of
our
physician
and
master
operated
principally
on
iron
in
which
the
most
healing
powers
were
said
to
be
concealed
if
one
only
knew
how
to
open
it
and
as
the
volatile
salt
which
must
be
produced
made
a
great
figure
in
all
the
writings
with
which
we
were
acquainted
so
for
these
operations
alkalies
also
were
required
which
while
they
flowed
away
into
the
air
were
to
unite
with
these
things
and
at
last
produce
a
mysterious
and
excellent
neutral
salt
scarcely
was
i
in
some
measure
recovered
and
favoured
by
the
change
in
the
season
able
once
more
to
occupy
my
old
than
i
also
began
to
provide
myself
with
a
little
apparatus
a
small
with
a
was
prepared
and
i
very
soon
learned
to
change
the
glass
alembics
with
a
piece
of
burning
into
vessels
in
which
the
different
mixtures
were
to
be
evaporated
now
were
the
strange
ingredients
of
the
macrocosm
and
microcosm
handled
in
an
odd
mysterious
manner
and
before
all
i
attempted
to
produce
neutral
salts
in
an
way
but
what
busied
me
most
for
a
long
time
was
the
which
is
made
by
melting
down
pure
with
a
proper
proportion
of
alkali
whence
results
a
transparent
glass
which
melts
away
on
exposure
to
the
air
and
exhibits
a
beautiful
clear
fluidity
whoever
has
once
prepared
this
himself
and
seen
it
with
his
own
eyes
will
not
blame
those
who
believe
in
a
maiden
earth
and
in
the
possibility
of
producing
further
effects
upon
it
by
means
of
it
i
had
acquired
a
peculiar
dexterity
in
preparing
this
the
fine
white
flints
which
are
found
in
the
maine
furnished
a
perfect
material
for
it
and
i
was
not
wanting
in
the
other
requisites
nor
in
diligence
but
i
became
weary
at
last
because
i
could
not
but
remark
that
the
flinty
substance
was
by
no
means
so
closely
combined
with
the
salt
as
i
had
philosophically
imagined
for
it
very
easily
separated
itself
again
and
this
most
beautiful
mineral
fluidity
which
to
my
greatest
astonishment
had
sometimes
appeared
in
the
form
of
an
animal
jelly
always
deposited
a
powder
which
i
was
forced
to
pronounce
the
finest
flint
dust
but
which
gave
not
the
least
sign
of
anything
productive
in
its
nature
from
which
one
could
have
hoped
to
see
this
maiden
earth
pass
into
the
maternal
state
strange
and
unconnected
as
these
operations
were
i
yet
learned
many
things
from
them
i
paid
strict
attention
to
all
the
crystallizations
that
might
occur
and
became
acquainted
with
the
external
forms
of
many
natural
things
and
inasmuch
as
i
well
knew
that
in
modern
times
chemical
subjects
were
treated
more
methodically
i
wished
to
get
a
general
conception
of
them
although
as
a
i
had
very
little
respect
for
the
apothecaries
and
all
those
who
operated
with
common
fire
however
the
chemical
of
boerhaave
attracted
me
powerfully
and
led
me
on
to
read
several
of
his
writings
in
which
since
moreover
my
tedious
illness
had
inclined
me
towards
medical
subjects
i
found
an
inducement
to
study
also
the
of
this
excellent
man
which
i
was
glad
to
stamp
upon
my
mind
and
in
my
memory
character
of
the
letters
from
leipzig
another
employment
somewhat
more
human
and
by
far
more
useful
for
my
cultivation
at
the
moment
was
reading
through
the
letters
which
i
had
written
home
from
leipzig
nothing
reveals
more
with
respect
to
ourselves
than
when
we
again
see
before
us
that
which
has
proceeded
from
us
years
before
so
that
we
can
now
consider
ourselves
as
an
object
of
contemplation
only
in
truth
i
was
then
too
young
and
the
epoch
which
was
represented
by
those
papers
was
still
too
near
as
in
our
younger
years
we
do
not
in
general
easily
cast
off
a
certain
conceit
this
especially
shows
itself
in
despising
what
we
have
been
but
a
little
time
before
for
while
indeed
we
perceive
as
we
advance
from
step
to
step
that
those
things
which
we
regard
as
good
and
excellent
in
ourselves
and
others
do
not
stand
their
ground
we
think
we
can
best
extricate
ourselves
from
this
dilemma
by
ourselves
throwing
away
what
we
can
not
preserve
so
it
was
with
me
also
for
as
in
leipzig
i
had
gradually
learned
to
set
little
value
on
my
childish
labours
so
now
my
academical
course
seemed
to
me
likewise
of
small
account
and
i
did
not
understand
that
for
this
very
reason
it
must
be
of
great
value
to
me
as
it
elevated
me
to
a
higher
degree
of
observation
and
insight
my
father
had
carefully
collected
and
sewed
together
my
letters
to
him
as
well
as
those
to
my
sister
nay
he
had
even
corrected
them
with
attention
and
improved
the
mistakes
both
in
writing
and
in
grammar
what
first
struck
me
in
these
letters
was
their
exterior
i
was
shocked
at
an
incredible
carelessness
in
the
handwriting
which
extended
from
october
to
the
middle
of
the
following
january
but
in
the
middle
of
march
there
appeared
all
at
once
a
quite
compressed
orderly
hand
such
as
i
used
formerly
to
employ
in
writing
for
a
prize
my
astonishment
at
this
resolved
itself
into
gratitude
towards
the
good
gellert
who
as
i
now
well
remembered
whenever
we
handed
in
our
essays
to
him
represented
to
us
in
his
hearty
tone
of
voice
that
it
was
our
sacred
duty
to
practise
our
hand
as
much
nay
more
than
our
style
he
repeated
this
as
often
as
any
scrawled
careless
writing
came
into
his
sight
on
which
occasion
he
often
said
that
he
would
much
like
to
make
a
good
hand
of
his
pupils
the
principal
end
in
his
instructions
the
more
so
as
he
had
often
remarked
that
a
good
hand
led
the
way
to
a
good
style
i
could
further
notice
that
the
french
and
english
passages
in
my
letters
although
not
free
from
blunders
were
nevertheless
written
with
facility
and
freedom
these
languages
i
had
likewise
continued
to
practise
in
my
correspondence
with
george
schlosser
who
was
still
at
treptow
and
i
had
remained
in
constant
communication
with
him
by
which
i
was
instructed
in
many
secular
affairs
for
things
did
not
always
turn
out
with
him
quite
as
he
had
hoped
and
acquired
an
ever
increasing
confidence
in
his
earnest
noble
way
of
thinking
another
consideration
which
could
not
escape
me
in
reading
through
these
letters
was
that
my
good
hither
with
the
best
intentions
had
done
me
a
special
mischief
and
had
led
me
into
that
odd
way
of
life
into
which
i
had
fallen
at
last
he
had
namely
repeatedly
warned
me
against
but
frau
hofrath
böhme
as
long
as
she
lived
contrived
to
persuade
me
after
her
own
fashion
by
declaring
that
my
father
warnings
were
only
against
the
abuse
now
as
i
likewise
saw
the
advantages
of
it
in
society
i
easily
suffered
myself
to
be
led
by
her
i
had
indeed
the
sense
of
play
but
not
the
spirit
of
play
i
learned
all
games
easily
and
rapidly
but
i
could
never
keep
up
the
proper
attention
for
a
whole
evening
therefore
when
i
began
very
well
i
invariably
failed
at
the
end
and
made
myself
and
others
lose
through
which
i
went
off
always
out
of
humour
either
to
the
or
out
of
the
company
scarcely
was
madame
böhme
dead
who
moreover
had
no
longer
kept
me
in
practice
during
her
tedious
illness
than
my
father
doctrine
gained
force
i
at
first
excused
myself
from
the
and
as
they
now
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
with
me
i
became
even
more
of
a
burden
to
myself
than
to
others
and
declined
the
imitations
which
then
became
more
rare
and
at
last
ceased
altogether
play
which
is
much
to
be
recommended
to
young
people
especially
to
those
who
have
a
practical
sense
and
wish
to
look
about
in
the
world
for
themselves
could
never
indeed
become
a
passion
with
me
for
i
never
got
further
though
i
might
play
as
long
as
i
would
had
any
one
given
me
a
general
view
of
the
subject
and
made
me
observe
how
here
certain
signs
and
more
or
less
of
chance
form
a
kind
of
material
on
which
judgment
and
activity
can
exercise
themselves
had
any
one
made
me
see
several
games
at
once
i
might
sooner
have
become
reconciled
with
all
this
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
i
had
come
to
the
conviction
from
the
above
considerations
that
one
should
not
avoid
social
games
but
should
rather
strive
after
a
certain
dexterity
in
them
time
is
infinitely
long
and
each
day
is
a
vessel
into
which
a
great
deal
may
be
poured
if
one
will
actually
fill
it
up
taste
for
drawing
revived
thus
variously
was
i
occupied
in
my
solitude
the
more
so
as
the
departed
spirits
of
the
different
tastes
to
which
i
had
from
time
to
time
devoted
myself
had
an
opportunity
to
reappear
i
thus
went
again
to
drawing
and
as
i
always
wished
to
labour
directly
from
nature
or
rather
from
reality
i
made
a
picture
of
my
chamber
with
its
furniture
and
the
persons
who
were
in
it
and
when
this
no
more
amused
me
i
represented
all
sorts
of
which
were
told
at
the
time
and
in
which
interest
was
taken
all
this
was
not
without
character
and
a
certain
taste
but
unfortunately
the
figures
lacked
proportion
and
the
proper
vigour
besides
which
the
execution
was
extremely
misty
sly
father
who
continued
to
take
pleasure
in
these
things
wished
to
have
them
more
distinct
everything
must
be
finished
and
properly
completed
he
therefore
had
them
mounted
and
surrounded
with
ruled
lines
nay
the
painter
morgenstern
his
domestic
artist
the
same
who
afterwards
made
himself
known
and
indeed
famous
by
his
had
to
insert
the
perspective
lines
of
the
rooms
and
chambers
which
then
indeed
stood
in
pretty
harsh
contrast
with
those
figures
in
this
manner
he
thought
constantly
to
compel
me
to
greater
accuracy
and
to
please
him
i
drew
various
objects
of
still
life
in
which
since
the
originals
stood
as
patterns
before
me
i
could
work
with
more
distinctness
and
precision
at
last
i
took
it
into
my
head
to
etch
once
more
i
had
composed
a
tolerably
interesting
landscape
and
felt
myself
very
happy
when
i
could
look
out
for
the
old
receipts
given
me
by
stock
and
could
at
my
work
call
to
mind
those
pleasant
times
i
soon
bit
the
plate
and
had
a
proof
taken
unluckily
the
composition
was
without
light
and
shade
and
i
now
tormented
myself
to
bring
in
both
but
as
it
was
not
quite
to
me
what
was
really
the
essential
point
i
could
not
finish
up
to
this
time
i
had
been
quite
well
after
my
own
fashion
but
now
a
disease
attacked
me
which
had
never
troubled
me
before
my
throat
namely
had
become
completely
sore
and
particularly
what
is
called
the
very
much
inflamed
i
could
only
swallow
with
great
pain
and
the
physicians
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
they
tormented
me
with
gargles
and
but
could
not
free
me
from
my
misery
at
last
it
struck
me
that
i
had
not
been
careful
enough
in
the
biting
of
my
plates
and
that
by
often
and
passionately
repeating
it
i
had
contracted
this
disease
and
had
always
revived
and
increased
it
to
the
physicians
this
cause
was
plausible
and
very
soon
certain
on
my
leaving
my
etching
and
biting
and
that
so
much
the
more
readily
as
the
attempt
had
by
no
means
turned
out
well
and
i
had
more
reason
to
conceal
than
to
exhibit
my
labours
for
which
i
consoled
myself
the
more
easily
as
i
very
soon
saw
myself
free
from
the
troublesome
disease
upon
this
i
could
not
refrain
from
the
reflection
that
my
similar
occupations
at
leipzig
might
have
greatly
contributed
to
those
diseases
from
which
i
had
suffered
so
much
it
is
indeed
a
tedious
and
withal
a
melancholy
business
to
take
too
much
care
of
ourselves
and
of
what
injures
and
benefits
us
but
there
is
no
question
but
that
with
the
wonderful
idiosyncrasy
of
human
nature
on
the
one
side
and
the
infinite
variety
in
the
mode
of
life
and
pleasure
on
the
other
it
is
a
wonder
that
the
human
race
has
not
worn
itself
out
long
ago
human
nature
appears
to
possess
a
peculiar
kind
of
toughness
and
since
it
subdues
everything
which
approaches
it
or
which
it
takes
into
itself
and
if
it
can
not
assimilate
at
least
makes
it
indifferent
in
case
of
any
great
excess
indeed
it
must
yield
to
the
elements
in
spite
of
all
resistance
as
the
many
endemic
diseases
and
the
effects
of
brandy
convince
us
could
we
without
being
morbidly
anxious
keep
watch
over
ourselves
as
to
what
operates
favourably
or
unfavourably
upon
us
in
our
complicated
civil
and
social
life
and
would
we
leave
off
what
is
actually
pleasant
to
us
as
an
enjoyment
for
the
sake
of
the
evil
consequences
we
should
thus
know
how
to
remove
with
ease
many
an
inconvenience
which
with
a
constitution
otherwise
sound
often
troubles
us
more
than
even
a
disease
unfortunately
it
is
in
dietetics
as
in
morals
we
can
not
see
into
a
fault
till
we
have
got
rid
of
it
by
which
nothing
is
gained
for
the
next
fault
is
not
like
the
preceding
one
and
therefore
can
not
be
recognised
under
the
same
form
survey
of
works
written
at
leipzig
in
reading
through
those
letters
which
had
been
written
from
leipzig
to
my
sister
this
remark
among
others
could
not
escape
me
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
my
academical
course
i
had
esteemed
myself
very
clever
and
wise
since
as
soon
as
i
had
learned
anything
i
put
myself
in
the
place
of
the
professor
and
so
became
didactic
on
the
spot
i
was
amused
to
see
how
i
had
immediately
applied
to
my
sister
whatever
gellert
had
imparted
or
advised
in
his
lectures
without
seeing
that
both
in
life
and
in
books
a
thing
may
be
proper
for
a
young
man
without
being
suitable
for
a
young
lady
and
we
both
together
made
merry
over
these
mimicries
the
poems
also
which
i
had
composed
in
leipzig
were
already
too
poor
for
me
and
they
seemed
to
me
cold
dry
and
in
respect
to
that
which
was
meant
to
express
the
state
of
the
human
heart
or
mind
too
superficial
this
induced
me
now
that
i
was
to
leave
my
father
house
once
more
and
go
to
a
second
university
again
to
decree
a
great
high
against
my
labours
several
commenced
plays
some
of
which
had
reached
the
third
or
the
fourth
act
while
others
had
only
the
plot
fully
made
out
together
with
many
other
poems
letters
and
papers
were
given
over
to
the
fire
and
scarcely
anything
was
spared
except
the
manuscript
by
behrisch
laune
des
and
which
last
i
constantly
went
on
improving
with
peculiar
affection
and
as
the
piece
was
already
complete
i
again
worked
over
the
plot
to
make
it
more
bustling
and
intelligible
lessing
in
the
first
two
acts
of
his
had
set
up
an
unattainable
model
of
the
way
in
which
a
drama
should
be
developed
and
nothing
was
to
me
of
greater
concern
than
to
enter
thoroughly
into
his
mind
and
his
views
the
recital
of
whatever
moved
excited
and
occupied
me
at
this
time
is
already
circumstantial
enough
but
i
must
nevertheless
again
recur
to
that
interest
with
which
things
had
inspired
me
of
which
i
once
for
all
so
far
as
might
be
possible
undertook
to
form
some
notion
i
experienced
a
great
influence
from
an
important
work
that
fell
into
my
hands
it
was
arnold
of
the
church
and
of
this
man
is
not
merely
a
reflective
historian
but
at
the
same
time
pious
and
feeling
his
sentiments
chimed
in
very
well
with
mine
and
what
particularly
delighted
me
in
his
work
was
that
i
received
a
more
favourable
notion
of
many
heretics
who
had
been
hitherto
represented
to
me
as
mad
or
impious
the
spirit
of
contradiction
and
the
love
of
paradoxes
stick
fast
in
us
all
i
diligently
studied
the
different
opinions
and
as
i
had
often
enough
heard
it
said
that
every
man
has
his
own
religion
at
last
so
nothing
seemed
more
natural
to
me
than
that
i
should
form
mine
too
and
this
i
did
with
much
satisfaction
the
lay
at
the
foundation
the
hermetical
the
mystical
the
cabalistic
also
contributed
their
share
and
thus
i
built
for
myself
a
world
that
looked
strange
enough
concoction
of
a
system
of
theology
i
could
well
represent
to
myself
a
godhead
which
has
gone
on
producing
itself
from
all
eternity
but
as
production
can
not
be
conceived
without
multiplicity
so
it
must
of
necessity
have
immediately
appeared
to
itself
as
a
second
which
we
recognise
under
the
name
of
the
son
now
these
two
must
continue
the
act
of
producing
and
again
appear
to
themselves
in
a
third
which
was
just
as
substantial
living
and
eternal
as
the
whole
with
these
however
the
circle
of
the
godhead
was
complete
and
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
them
to
produce
another
perfectly
equal
to
them
but
since
however
the
work
of
production
always
proceeded
they
created
a
fourth
which
already
fostered
in
himself
a
contradiction
inasmuch
as
it
was
like
them
unlimited
and
yet
at
the
same
time
was
to
be
contained
in
them
and
bounded
by
them
now
this
was
lucifer
to
whom
the
whole
power
of
creation
was
committed
from
this
time
and
from
whom
all
other
beings
were
to
proceed
he
immediately
displayed
his
infinite
activity
by
creating
the
whole
body
of
angels
all
again
after
his
own
likeness
unlimited
but
contained
in
him
and
bounded
by
him
surrounded
by
such
a
glory
he
forgot
his
higher
origin
and
believed
that
he
could
find
himself
in
himself
and
from
this
first
ingratitude
sprang
all
that
does
not
seem
to
us
in
accordance
with
the
will
and
purposes
of
the
godhead
now
the
more
he
concentrated
himself
within
himself
the
more
painful
must
it
have
become
to
him
as
well
as
to
all
the
spirits
whose
sweet
uprising
to
their
origin
he
had
embittered
and
so
that
happened
which
is
intimated
to
us
under
the
form
of
the
fall
of
the
angels
one
part
of
them
concentrated
itself
with
lucifer
the
other
turned
itself
again
to
its
origin
from
this
concentration
of
the
whole
creation
for
it
had
proceeded
out
of
lucifer
and
was
forced
to
follow
him
sprang
all
that
we
perceive
under
the
form
of
matter
which
we
figure
to
ourselves
as
heavy
solid
and
dark
but
which
since
it
is
descended
if
not
even
immediately
yet
by
filiation
from
the
divine
being
is
just
as
unlimited
powerful
and
eternal
as
its
sire
and
grandsire
since
now
the
whole
mischief
if
we
may
call
it
so
merely
arose
through
the
direction
of
lucifer
the
better
half
was
indeed
wanting
to
this
creation
for
it
possessed
all
that
is
gained
by
concentration
while
it
lacked
all
that
can
be
effected
by
expansion
alone
and
so
the
whole
creation
could
have
destroyed
itself
by
everlasting
concentration
could
have
annihilated
itself
with
its
father
lucifer
and
have
lost
all
its
claims
to
an
equal
eternity
with
the
godhead
this
condition
the
elohim
contemplated
for
a
time
and
they
had
their
choice
to
wait
for
those
æons
in
which
the
field
would
again
have
become
clear
and
space
would
be
left
them
for
a
new
creation
or
if
they
would
to
seize
upon
that
which
existed
already
and
supply
the
want
according
to
their
own
eternity
now
they
chose
the
latter
and
by
their
mere
will
supplied
in
an
instant
the
whole
want
which
the
consequence
of
lucifer
undertaking
drew
after
it
they
gave
to
the
eternal
being
the
faculty
of
expanding
itself
of
moving
itself
towards
them
the
peculiar
pulse
of
life
was
again
restored
and
lucifer
himself
could
not
avoid
its
effects
this
is
the
epoch
when
that
appeared
which
we
know
as
light
and
when
that
began
which
we
are
accustomed
to
designate
by
the
word
creation
greatly
now
as
this
multiplied
itself
by
progressive
degrees
through
the
continually
working
vital
power
of
the
elohim
still
a
being
was
wanting
who
might
be
able
to
restore
the
original
connexion
with
the
godhead
and
thus
man
was
produced
who
in
all
things
was
to
be
similar
yea
equal
to
the
godhead
but
thereby
in
effect
found
himself
once
more
in
the
situation
of
lucifer
that
of
being
at
once
unlimited
and
bounded
and
since
this
contradiction
was
to
manifest
itself
in
him
through
all
the
categories
of
existence
and
a
perfect
consciousness
as
well
as
a
decided
will
was
to
accompany
his
various
conditions
it
was
to
be
foreseen
that
he
must
be
at
the
same
time
the
most
perfect
and
the
most
imperfect
the
most
happy
and
the
most
unhappy
creature
it
was
not
long
before
he
too
completely
played
the
part
of
lucifer
true
ingratitude
is
the
separation
from
the
benefactor
and
thus
that
fall
was
manifest
for
the
second
time
although
the
whole
creation
is
nothing
and
was
nothing
but
a
falling
from
and
returning
to
the
original
one
easily
sees
how
the
redemption
is
not
only
decreed
from
eternity
but
is
considered
as
eternally
necessary
nay
that
it
must
ever
renew
itself
through
the
whole
time
of
generation
and
existence
in
this
view
of
the
subject
nothing
is
more
natural
than
for
the
divinity
himself
to
take
the
form
of
man
which
had
already
prepared
itself
as
a
veil
and
to
share
his
fate
for
a
short
time
in
order
by
this
assimilation
to
enhance
his
joys
and
alleviate
his
sorrows
the
history
of
all
religions
and
philosophies
teaches
us
that
this
great
truth
indispensable
for
man
has
been
handed
down
by
different
nations
in
different
times
in
various
ways
and
even
in
strange
fables
and
images
in
accordance
with
their
limited
knowledge
enough
if
it
only
be
acknowledged
that
we
find
ourselves
in
a
condition
which
even
if
it
seems
to
drag
us
down
and
oppress
us
yet
gives
us
opportunity
nay
even
makes
it
our
duty
to
raise
ourselves
up
and
to
fulfil
the
purposes
of
the
godhead
in
this
manner
that
while
we
are
compelled
on
the
one
hand
to
concentrate
ourselves
zu
we
on
the
other
hand
do
not
omit
to
expand

similar

and
similar
views
manifested

in

directions
they
made
upon
us
lively
youths
a
very
great
impression
which
had
the
more
decided
effect
as
it
was
strengthened
besides
by
wieland
example
for
the
works
of
his
second

period
clearly
showed
that
he
had
formed
himself
according
to
such
maxims
and
what
more

its
abstruse
questions
was
set
aside
the
classic
languages
the
acquisition
of
which
is
accompanied
by
so
much
drudgery
one
saw
thrust
into
the
background
the
compendiums
about
the
sufficiency
of
which
handel
had
already
whispered
a
doubtful
word
into
the
ear
came
more
and
more
into
suspicion
we
were
directed
to
the
contemplation
of
an
active
life
which
we
were
so
fond
of
leading
and
to
the
knowledge
of
the
passions
which
we
partly
felt
partly
anticipated
in
our
own
bosoms
and
which
if
though
they
had
been
rebuked
formerly
now
appeared
to
us
as
something
important
and
dignified
because
they
were
to
be
the
chief
object
of
our
studies
and
the
knowledge
of
them
was
extolled
as
the
most
excellent
means
of
cultivating
our
mental
powers
besides
this
such
a
mode
of
thought
was
quite
in
accordance
with
my
own
conviction
nay
with
my
poetical
mode
of
treatment
i
therefore
without
opposition
after
i
had
thwarted
so
many
good
designs
and
seen
so
many
fair
hopes
vanish
reconciled
myself
to
my
father
intention
of
sending
me
to
strasburg
where
i
was
promised
a
cheerful
gay
life
while
i
should
prosecute
my
studies
and
at
last
take
my
degree
in
spring
i
felt
my
health
but
still
more
my
youthful
spirits
again
restored
and
once
more
longed
to
be
out
of
my
father
house
though
with
reasons
far
different
from
those
on
the
first
time
the
pretty
chambers
and
spots
where
i
had
suffered
so
much
had
become
disagreeable
to
me
and
with
my
father
himself
there
could
be
no
pleasant
relation
i
could
not
quite
pardon
him
for
having
manifested
more
impatience
than
was
reasonable
at
the
relapse
of
my
disease
and
at
my
tedious
recovery
nay
for
having
instead
of
comforting
me
by
forbearance
frequently
expressed
himself
in
a
cruel
manner
about
that
which
lay
in
no
man
hand
as
if
it
depended
only
on
the
will
and
he
too
was
in
various
ways
hurt
and
offended
by
me
for
young
people
bring
back
from
the
university
general
ideas
which
indeed
is
quite
right
and
good
but
because
they
fancy
themselves
very
wise
in
this
they
apply
them
as
a
standard
to
the
objects
that
occur
which
must
then
for
the
most
part
lose
by
the
comparison
thus
i
had
gained
a
general
notion
of
architecture
and
of
the
arrangement
and
decoration
of
houses
and
imprudently
in
conversation
had
applied
this
to
our
own
house
my
father
had
designed
the
whole
arrangement
of
it
and
carried
through
the
building
with
great
perseverance
and
considering
that
it
was
to
be
exclusively
a
residence
for
himself
and
his
family
nothing
could
be
objected
to
it
in
this
taste
also
very
many
of
the
houses
in
frankfort
were
built
an
open
staircase
ran
up
through
the
house
and
touched
upon
large
which
might
very
well
have
been
chambers
themselves
as
indeed
we
always
passed
the
tine
season
in
them
but
this
pleasant
cheerful
existence
for
a
single
family
this
communication
from
above
to
below
became
the
greatest
inconvenience
as
soon
as
several
parties
occupied
the
house
as
we
had
but
too
well
experienced
on
the
occasion
of
the
french
quartering
for
that
painful
scene
with
the
king
lieutenant
would
not
have
happened
nay
my
father
would
even
have
felt
all
those
disagreeable
matters
less
if
after
the
leipzig
fashion
our
staircase
had
run
close
along
the
side
of
the
house
and
a
separate
door
had
been
given
to
each
story
this
style
of
building
i
once
praised
highly
for
its
advantages
and
showed
my
father
the
possibility
of
altering
his
staircase
also
whereupon
he
fell
into
an
incredible
passion
which
was
the
more
violent
as
a
short
time
before
i
had
found
fault
with
some
scrolled
frames
and
rejected
certain
chinese
hangings
a
scene
ensued
which
indeed
was
again
hushed
up
and
smothered
but
it
hastened
my
journey
to
the
beautiful
alsace
which
i
accomplished
in
the
comfortable
diligence
without
delay
and
in
a
short
time
i
alighted
at
the
ghost
tavern
and
hastened
at
once
to
satisfy
my
most
earnest
desire
and
to
approach
the
minster
which
had
long
since
been
pointed
out
to
me
by
and
had
been
before
my
eyes
for
a
great
distance
when
i
first
perceived
this
colossus
through
the
narrow
lanes
and
then
stood
too
near
before
it
in
the
truly
confined
little
square
it
made
upon
me
an
impression
quite
of
its
own
kind
which
i
being
unable
to
analyse
it
on
the
spot
carried
with
me
only
indistinctly
for
this
time
as
i
hastily
ascended
the
building
so
as
not
to
neglect
the
beautiful
moment
of
a
high
and
cheerful
sun
which
was
to
disclose
to
me
at
once
the
broad
rich
land
arrival
at
strasburg
and
now
from
the
platform
i
saw
before
me
the
beautiful
region
in
which
i
should
for
a
long
time
live
and
reside
the
handsome
city
the
meadows
around
it
thickly
set
and
interwoven
with
magnificent
trees
that
striking
richness
of
vegetation
which
follows
in
the
windings
of
the
rhine
marks
its
banks
islands
and
aits
nor
is
the
level
ground
stretching
down
from
the
south
and
watered
by
the
iller
less
adorned
with
varied
green
even
westward
towards
the
mountains
there
are
many
low
grounds
which
afford
quite
as
charming
a
view
of
wood
and
just
as
the
northern
and
more
hilly
part
is
intersected
by
innumerable
little
brooks
which
promote
a
rapid
vegetation
everywhere
if
one
imagines
between
these
luxuriant
outstretched
meads
between
these
joyously
scattered
groves
all
land
adapted
for
tillage
excellently
prepared
verdant
and
ripening
and
the
best
and
richest
spots
marked
by
hamlets
and
and
this
great
and
immeasurable
plain
prepared
for
roan
like
a
new
paradise
bounded
far
and
near
by
mountains
partly
cultivated
partly
overgrown
with
woods
one
will
then
conceive
the
rapture
with
which
i
blessed
my
fate
that
it
had
destined
me
for
some
time
so
beautiful
a
such
a
fresh
glance
into
a
new
land
in
which
we
are
to
abide
for
a
time
has
still
the
peculiarity
both
pleasant
and
foreboding
that
the
whole
lies
before
us
like
an
unwritten
tablet
as
yet
no
sorrows
and
joys
which
relate
to
ourselves
are
recorded
upon
it
this
cheerful
varied
animated
plain
is
still
mute
for
us
the
eye
is
only
fixed
on
the
objects
so
far
as
they
are
intrinsically
important
and
neither
affection
nor
passion
have
especially
to
render
prominent
this
or
that
spot
but
a
presentiment
of
the
future
already
disquiets
the
young
heart
and
an
unsatisfied
craving
secretly
demands
that
which
is
to
come
and
may
come
and
which
at
all
events
whether
for
good
or
ill
will
imperceptibly
assume
the
character
of
the
spot
in
which
we
find
ourselves
descended
from
the
height
i
still
tarried
awhile
before
the
face
of
the
venerable
pile
but
what
i
could
not
quite
clearly
make
out
either
the
first
or
the
following
time
was
that
i
regarded
this
miracle
as
a
monster
which
must
have
terrified
me
if
it
had
not
at
the
same
time
appeared
to
me
comprehensible
by
its
regularity
and
even
pleasing
in
its
finish
yet
i
by
no
means
busied
myself
with
meditating
on
this
contradiction
but
suffered
a
monument
so
astonishing
quietly
to
work
upon
me
by
its
presence
meyer
i
took
small
but
and
pleasant
lodgings
on
the
summer
side
of
the
a
fine
long
street
where
the
everlasting
motion
came
to
the
assistance
of
every
unoccupied
moment
i
then
delivered
my
letters
of
introduction
and
found
among
my
patrons
a
merchant
who
with
his
family
was
devoted
to
those
pious
opinions
sufficiently
known
to
me
although
as
far
as
regarded
external
worship
he
had
not
separated
from
the
church
he
was
a
man
of
intelligence
withal
and
by
no
means
hypocritical
in
his
actions
the
company
of
boarders
which
was
recommended
to
me
and
indeed
i
to
it
was
very
agreeable
and
entertaining
a
couple
of
old
maids
had
long
kept
up
this
with
regularity
and
good
success
there
might
have
been
about
ten
persons
older
and
younger
of
these
latter
one
named
meyer
a
native
of
lindau
is
most
vividly
present
to
me
from
his
form
and
face
he
might
have
been
considered
one
of
the
handsomest
of
men
if
at
the
same
time
he
had
not
had
something
of
the
sloven
in
his
whole
appearance
in
like
manner
his
splendid
natural
talents
were
deformed
by
an
incredible
levity
and
his
excellent
temper
by
an
unbounded
dissoluteness
he
had
an
open
joyous
face
more
round
than
oval
the
organs
of
the
senses
the
eyes
nose
mouth
and
ears
could
be
called
rich
they
showed
a
decided
fulness
without
being
too
large
the
mouth
was
particularly
charming
from
the
curling
lips
and
his
whole
physiognomy
had
the
peculiar
expression
of
a
rake
from
the
circumstance
that
his
eyebrows
met
across
his
nose
which
in
a
handsome
face
always
produces
a
pleasant
expression
of
sensuality
by
his
jovialness
sincerity
and
he
made
himself
beloved
by
all
his
memory
was
incredible
attention
at
the
lectures
cost
him
nothing
he
retained
all
that
he
heard
and
was
intellectual
enough
to
take
some
interest
in
everything
and
this
the
more
easily
as
he
was
studying
medicine
all
impressions
remained
lively
with
him
and
his
waggery
in
repeating
the
lectures
and
mimicking
the
professors
often
went
so
far
that
when
he
had
heard
three
different
lectures
in
one
morning
he
would
at
the
interchange
the
professors
with
each
other
paragraphwise
and
often
even
more
abruptly
which
lecture
frequently
entertained
us
but
often
too
became
troublesome
the
rest
were
more
or
less
polite
steady
serious
people
a
pensioned
knight
of
the
order
of
louis
was
one
of
these
but
the
majority
were
students
all
really
good
and
only
they
were
not
allowed
to
go
beyond
their
usual
allowance
of
wine
that
this
should
not
be
easily
done
was
the
care
of
our
president
one
doctor
salzmann
already
in
the
sixties
and
unmarried
he
had
attended
this
for
many
years
and
maintained
its
good
order
and
respectability
he
possessed
a
handsome
property
kept
himself
close
and
neat
in
his
exterior
even
belonging
to
those
who
always
go
in
shoes
and
stockings
and
with
their
hat
under
their
arm
to
put
on
the
hat
was
with
him
an
extraordinary
action
he
commonly
carried
an
umbrella
wisely
reflecting
that
the
finest
often
bring
thunderstorms
and
passing
showers
over
the
country
with
this
man
i
talked
over
my
design
of
continuing
to
study
jurisprudence
at
strasburg
so
as
to
be
able
to
take
my
degree
as
soon
as
possible
since
he
was
exactly
informed
of
everything
i
asked
him
about
the
lectures
i
should
have
to
hear
and
what
he
generally
thought
of
the
matter
to
this
he
replied
that
it
was
not
in
strasburg
as
in
the
german
universities
where
they
try
to
educate
jurists
in
the
large
and
learned
sense
of
the
term
here
in
conformity
with
the
relation
towards
france
all
was
really
directed
to
the
practical
and
managed
in
accordance
with
the
opinions
of
the
french
who
readily
stop
at
what
is
given
they
tried
to
impart
to
every
one
certain
general
principles
and
preliminary
knowledge
they
compressed
as
much
as
possible
and
communicated
only
what
was
most
necessary
hereupon
he
made
me
acquainted
with
a
man
in
whom
as
a
great
confidence
was
entertained
which
he
very
soon
managed
to
gain
from
me
also
by
way
of
introduction
i
began
to
speak
with
him
on
subjects
of
jurisprudence
and
he
wondered
not
a
little
at
my
swaggering
for
during
my
residence
at
leipzig
i
had
gained
more
of
an
insight
into
the
requisites
for
the
law
than
i
have
hitherto
taken
occasion
to
state
in
my
narrative
though
all
i
had
acquired
could
only
be
reckoned
as
a
general
encyclopedical
survey
and
not
as
proper
definite
knowledge
university
life
even
if
in
the
course
of
it
we
may
not
have
to
boast
of
our
own
proper
industry
nevertheless
affords
endless
advantages
in
every
kind
of
cultivation
because
we
are
always
surrounded
by
men
who
either
possess
or
are
seeking
science
so
that
even
if
unconsciously
we
are
constantly
drawing
some
nourishment
from
such
an
atmosphere
taste
for
medical
studies
my
repetent
after
he
had
had
patience
with
my
rambling
discourse
for
some
time
gave
me
at
last
to
understand
that
i
must
first
of
all
keep
my
immediate
object
in
view
which
was
to
be
examined
to
take
my
degree
and
then
perchance
to
commence
practice
in
order
to
stand
the
first
said
he
the
subject
is
by
no
means
investigated
at
large
it
is
inquired
how
and
when
a
law
arose
and
what
gave
the
internal
or
external
occasion
for
it
there
is
no
inquiry
as
to
how
it
has
been
altered
by
time
and
custom
or
how
far
it
has
perhaps
been
perverted
by
false
interpretation
or
the
perverted
usage
of
the
courts
it
is
in
such
investigations
that
learned
men
quite
peculiarly
spend
their
lives
but
we
inquire
after
that
which
exists
at
present
this
we
stamp
firmly
on
our
memory
that
it
may
always
be
ready
when
we
wish
to
employ
it
for
the
use
and
defence
of
our
clients
thus
we
qualify
our
young
people
for
their
future
life
and
the
rest
follows
in
proportion
to
their
talents
and
activity
hereupon
he
handed
me
his
pamphlets
which
were
written
in
question
and
answer
and
in
which
i
could
have
stood
a
pretty
good
examination
at
once
for
hopp
smaller
was
yet
perfectly
in
my
memory
the
rest
i
supplied
with
some
diligence
and
against
my
will
qualified
myself
in
the
easiest
manner
as
a
candidate
but
since
in
this
way
all
my
own
activity
in
the
study
was
cut
off
for
i
had
no
sense
for
anything
positive
but
wished
to
have
everything
explained
historically
if
not
intelligibly
i
found
for
my
powers
a
wider
field
which
i
employed
in
the
most
singular
manner
by
devoting
myself
to
a
matter
of
interest
which
was
accidently
presented
to
me
from
without
most
of
my
were
medical
students
these
as
is
well
known
are
the
only
students
who
zealously
converse
about
their
science
and
profession
even
out
of
the
hours
of
study
this
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
case
the
objects
of
their
endeavours
are
the
most
obvious
to
the
senses
and
at
the
same
time
the
highest
the
most
simple
and
the
most
complicated
medicine
employs
the
whole
man
for
it
occupies
itself
with
the
whole
man
all
that
the
young
man
learns
refers
directly
to
an
important
dangerous
indeed
but
yet
in
many
respects
lucrative
practice
he
therefore
devotes
himself
passionately
to
whatever
is
to
be
known
and
to
be
done
partly
because
it
is
interesting
in
itself
partly
because
it
opens
to
him
the
joyous
prospect
of
independence
and
wealth
at
table
then
i
heard
nothing
but
medical
conversations
just
as
formerly
in
the
of
hofrath
ludwig
in
our
walks
and
in
our
likewise
not
much
else
was
talked
about
for
my
like
good
fellows
had
also
become
my
companions
at
other
times
and
they
were
always
joined
on
all
sides
by
persons
of
like
minds
and
like
studies
the
medical
faculty
in
general
shone
above
the
others
with
respect
both
to
the
celebrity
of
the
professors
and
the
number
of
the
students
and
i
was
the
more
easily
borne
along
by
the
stream
as
i
had
just
so
much
knowledge
of
all
these
things
that
my
desire
for
science
could
soon
be
increased
and
inflamed
at
the
commencement
of
the
second
therefore
i
attended
a
course
on
chemistry
by
spielmann
another
on
anatomy
by
lobstein
and
proposed
to
be
right
industrious
because
by
my
singular
preliminary
or
rather
extra
knowledge
i
had
already
gained
some
respect
and
confidence
in
our
society
preparations
for
reception
of
marie
antoinette
yet
this
dissipation
and
dismemberment
of
my
studies
was
not
enough
they
were
to
be
once
more
seriously
disturbed
for
a
remarkable
political
event
set
everything
in
motion
and
procured
us
a
tolerable
succession
of
holidays
marie
antoinette
archduchess
of
austria
and
queen
of
france
was
to
pass
through
strasburg
on
her
road
to
paris
the
solemnities
by
which
the
people
are
made
to
take
notice
that
there
is
greatness
in
the
world
were
busily
and
abundantly
prepared
and
especially
remarkable
to
me
was
the
building
which
stood
on
an
island
in
the
rhine
between
the
two
bridges
erected
for
her
reception
and
for
surrendering
her
into
the
hands
of
her
husband
ambassadors
it
was
but
slightly
elevated
above
the
ground
had
in
the
centre
a
grand
saloon
on
each
side
smaller
ones
then
followed
other
chambers
which
extended
somewhat
backwards
enough
had
it
been
more
durably
built
it
might
have
answered
very
well
as
a
for
persons
of
rank
but
that
which
particularly
interested
me
and
for
which
i
did
not
grudge
many
a
a
little
silver
coin
then
current
in
order
to
procure
a
repeated
entrance
from
the
porter
was
the
embroidered
tapestry
with
which
they
had
lined
the
whole
interior
here
for
the
first
time
i
saw
a
specimen
of
those
tapestries
worked
after
raffaelle
cartoons
and
this
sight
was
for
me
of
very
decided
influence
as
i
became
acquainted
with
the
true
and
the
perfect
on
a
large
scale
though
only
in
copies
i
went
and
came
and
came
and
went
and
could
not
satiate
myself
with
looking
nay
a
vain
endeavour
troubled
me
because
i
would
willingly
have
comprehended
what
interested
me
in
so
extraordinary
a
manner
i
found
these
highly
delightful
and
refreshing
but
the
chief
saloon
so
much
the
more
shocking
this
had
been
hung
with
many
larger
more
brilliant
and
richer
hangings
which
were
surrounded
with
crowded
ornaments
worked
after
pictures
by
the
modern
french
now
i
might
perhaps
have
reconciled
myself
to
this
style
also
as
my
feelings
like
my
judgment
did
not
readily
reject
anything
entirely
but
the
subject
was
excessively
revolting
to
me
these
pictures
contained
the
history
of
jason
medea
and
creusa
and
therefore
an
example
of
the
most
unhappy
marriage
to
the
left
of
the
throne
was
seen
the
bride
struggling
with
the
most
horrible
death
surrounded
by
persons
full
of
sympathizing
woe
to
the
right
was
the
father
horrified
at
the
murdered
babes
before
his
feet
whilst
the
fury
in
her
drove
along
into
the
air
and
that
the
horrible
and
atrocious
should
not
lack
something
absurd
the
white
tail
of
that
magic
bull
flourished
out
on
the
from
behind
the
red
velvet
of
the
back
of
the
throne
while
the
beast
himself
and
the
jason
who
was
fighting
with
him
were
completely
covered
by
the
sumptuous
drapery
here
all
the
maxims
which
i
had
made
my
own
in
oeser
school
were
stirring
within
my
bosom
it
was
without
proper
selection
and
judgment
to
begin
with
that
christ
and
the
apostles
were
brought
into
the
of
a
nuptial
building
and
doubtless
the
size
of
the
chambers
had
guided
the
royal
this
however
i
willingly
forgave
because
it
had
turned
out
so
much
to
my
advantage
but
a
blunder
like
that
in
the
grand
saloon
put
me
altogether
out
of
my
and
with
animation
and
vehemence
i
called
on
my
comrades
to
witness
such
a
crime
against
taste
and
feeling
what
cried
i
without
regarding
the
bystanders
is
it
permitted
so
thoughtlessly
to
place
before
the
eyes
of
a
young
queen
at
her
first
setting
foot
in
her
dominions
the
representation
of
the
most
horrible
marriage
that
perhaps
was
ever
consummated
is
there
then
among
the
french
architects
decorators
upholsterers
not
a
single
man
who
understands
that
pictures
represent
something
that
pictures
work
upon
the
mind
and
feelings
that
they
make
impressions
that
they
excite
forebodings
it
is
just
the
same
as
if
they
had
sent
the
most
ghastly
spectre
to
meet
this
beauteous
and
lady
at
the
very
frontiers
i
know
not
what
i
said
besides
enough
my
comrades
tried
to
quiet
me
and
to
remove
me
out
of
the
house
that
there
might
be
no
offence
they
then
assured
me
that
it
was
not
everybody
concern
to
look
for
significance
in
pictures
that
to
themselves
at
least
nothing
of
the
sort
would
have
occurred
while
the
whole
population
of
strasburg
and
the
vicinity
which
was
to
throng
thither
would
no
more
take
such
crotchets
into
their
heads
than
the
queen
herself
and
her
court
i
yet
remember
well
the
beauteous
and
lofty
mien
as
cheerful
as
it
was
imposing
of
this
youthful
lady
perfectly
visible
to
us
all
in
her
glass
carriage
she
seemed
to
be
jesting
with
her
female
attendants
in
familiar
conversation
about
the
throng
that
poured
forth
to
meet
her
train
in
the
evening
we
roamed
through
the
streets
to
look
at
the
various
illuminated
buildings
but
especially
the
glowing
spire
of
the
minster
with
which
both
near
and
in
the
distance
we
could
not
sufficiently
feast
our
eyes
the
queen
pursued
her
way
the
country
people
dispersed
and
the
city
was
soon
quiet
as
ever
before
the
queen
arrival
the
very
rational
regulation
had
been
made
that
no
deformed
persons
no
cripples
nor
disgusting
invalids
should
show
themselves
on
her
route
people
joked
about
this
and
i
made
a
little
french
poem
in
which
i
compared
the
advent
of
christ
who
seemed
to
wander
upon
the
world
particularly
on
account
of
the
sick
and
the
lame
with
the
arrival
of
the
queen
who
scared
these
unfortunates
away
my
friends
let
it
pass
a
frenchman
on
the
contrary
who
lived
with
us
criticised
the
language
and
metre
very
unmercifully
although
as
it
seemed
with
too
much
foundation
and
i
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
made
a
french
poem
afterwards
dreadful
accident
at
paris
scarcely
had
the
news
of
the
queen
happy
arrival
rung
from
the
capital
than
it
was
followed
by
the
horrible
intelligence
that
owing
to
an
oversight
of
the
police
during
the
festal
fireworks
an
infinite
number
of
persons
with
horses
and
carriages
had
been
destroyed
in
a
street
obstructed
by
building
materials
and
that
the
city
in
the
midst
of
the
nuptial
solemnities
had
been
plunged
into
mourning
and
sorrow
they
attempted
to
conceal
the
extent
of
the
misfortune
both
from
the
young
royal
pair
and
from
the
world
by
burying
the
dead
in
secret
so
that
many
families
were
convinced
only
by
the
ceaseless
absence
of
their
members
that
they
too
had
been
swept
off
by
this
awful
event
that
on
this
occasion
those
ghastly
figures
in
the
grand
saloon
again
came
vividly
before
my
mind
i
need
scarcely
mention
for
every
one
knows
how
powerful
certain
moral
impressions
are
when
they
embody
themselves
as
it
were
in
those
of
the
senses
this
occurrence
was
however
destined
moreover
to
place
my
friends
in
anxiety
and
trouble
by
means
of
a
prank
in
which
i
indulged
among
us
young
people
who
had
been
at
leipzig
there
had
been
maintained
ever
afterwards
a
certain
itch
for
imposing
on
and
in
some
way
mystifying
one
another
with
this
wanton
love
of
mischief
i
wrote
to
a
friend
in
frankfort
he
was
the
one
who
had
amplified
my
poem
on
the
hendel
applied
it
to
and
caused
its
general
circulation
a
letter
dated
from
versailles
in
which
i
informed
him
of
my
happy
arrival
there
my
participation
in
the
solemnities
and
other
things
of
the
kind
but
at
the
same
time
enjoined
the
strictest
secrecy
i
must
here
remark
that
from
the
time
of
that
trick
which
had
caused
us
so
much
annoyance
our
little
leipzig
society
had
accustomed
itself
to
persecute
him
from
time
to
time
with
mystifications
and
this
especially
as
he
was
the
drollest
man
in
the
world
and
was
never
more
amiable
than
when
he
was
discovering
the
cheat
into
which
he
had
deliberately
been
led
shortly
after
i
had
written
this
letter
i
went
on
a
little
journey
and
remained
absent
about
a
fortnight
meanwhile
the
news
of
that
disaster
had
reached
frankfort
my
friend
believed
me
in
paris
and
his
affection
led
him
to
apprehend
that
i
might
have
been
involved
in
the
calamity
he
inquired
of
my
parents
and
other
persons
to
whom
i
was
accustomed
to
write
whether
any
letters
had
arrived
and
as
it
was
just
at
the
time
when
my
journey
kept
me
from
sending
any
they
were
altogether
wanting
he
went
about
in
the
greatest
uneasiness
and
at
last
told
the
matter
in
confidence
to
our
nearest
friends
who
were
now
in
equal
anxiety
fortunately
this
conjecture
did
not
reach
my
parents
until
a
letter
had
arrived
announcing
my
return
to
strasburg
my
young
friends
were
satisfied
to
learn
that
i
was
alive
but
remained
firmly
convinced
that
i
had
been
at
paris
in
the
interim
the
affectionate
intelligence
of
the
solicitude
they
had
felt
on
my
account
affected
me
so
much
that
i
vowed
to
leave
off
such
tricks
for
ever
but
unfortunately
i
have
often
since
allowed
myself
to
be
guilty
of
something
similar
real
life
frequently
loses
its
brilliancy
to
such
a
degree
that
one
is
many
a
time
forced
to
polish
it
up
again
with
the
varnish
of
fiction
this
mighty
stream
of
courtly
magnificence
had
now
flowed
by
and
had
left
in
me
no
other
longing
than
after
those
tapestries
of
raffaelle
which
i
would
willingly
have
gazed
at
revered
nay
adored
every
day
and
every
hour
fortunately
my
passionate
endeavours
succeeded
in
interesting
several
persons
of
consequence
in
them
so
that
they
were
taken
down
and
packed
up
as
late
as
possible
we
now
gave
ourselves
up
again
to
our
quiet
easy
routine
of
the
university
and
society
and
in
the
latter
the
actuary
salzmann
president
of
our
table
continued
to
be
the
general
pedagogue
his
intelligence
complaisance
and
dignity
which
he
always
contrived
to
maintain
amid
all
the
jests
and
often
even
in
the
little
extravagances
which
he
allowed
us
made
him
beloved
and
respected
by
the
whole
company
and
i
could
mention
but
few
instances
where
he
showed
his
serious
displeasure
or
interposed
with
authority
in
little
quarrels
and
disputes
yet
among
them
all
i
was
the
one
who
most
attached
myself
to
him
and
he
was
not
less
inclined
to
converse
with
me
as
he
found
me
more
variously
accomplished
than
the
others
and
not
so
in
judgment
i
also
followed
his
directions
in
external
matters
so
that
he
could
without
hesitation
publicly
acknowledge
me
as
his
companion
and
comrade
for
although
he
only
filled
an
office
which
seems
to
be
of
little
influence
he
administered
it
in
a
manner
which
redounded
to
his
highest
honour
he
was
actuary
to
the
court
of
wards
and
there
indeed
like
the
perpetual
secretary
of
an
university
he
had
properly
speaking
the
management
of
affairs
in
his
own
hands
now
as
he
had
conducted
this
business
with
the
greatest
exactness
for
many
years
there
was
no
family
from
the
first
to
the
last
which
did
not
owe
him
its
gratitude
as
indeed
scarcely
any
one
in
the
whole
administration
of
government
can
earn
more
blessings
or
more
curses
than
one
who
takes
charge
of
the
orphans
or
on
the
contrary
squanders
or
suffers
to
be
squandered
their
property
and
goods
strasburg
manners
the
strasburgers
are
passionate
walkers
and
they
have
a
good
right
to
be
so
let
one
turn
one
steps
as
one
will
one
finds
partly
natural
partly
adorned
by
art
in
ancient
and
modern
times
all
of
them
visited
and
enjoyed
by
a
cheerful
merry
little
people
but
what
made
the
sight
of
a
great
number
of
pedestrians
still
more
agreeable
here
than
in
other
places
was
the
various
costume
of
the
fair
sex
the
middle
class
of
city
girls
yet
retained
the
hair
twisted
up
and
secured
by
a
large
pin
as
well
as
a
certain
close
style
of
dress
in
which
anything
like
a
train
would
have
been
unbecoming
and
the
pleasant
part
of
it
was
that
this
costume
did
not
differ
violently
according
to
the
rank
of
the
wearer
for
there
were
still
some
families
of
opulence
and
distinction
who
would
not
permit
their
daughters
to
deviate
from
this
costume
the
rest
followed
the
french
fashion
and
this
party
made
some
proselytes
every
year
salzmann
had
many
acquaintances
and
an
entrance
everywhere
a
very
pleasant
circumstance
for
his
companion
especially
in
summer
for
good
company
and
refreshment
were
found
in
all
the
public
gardens
far
and
near
and
more
than
one
invitation
for
this
or
that
pleasant
day
was
received
on
one
such
occasion
i
found
an
opportunity
to
recommend
myself
very
rapidly
to
a
family
which
i
was
visiting
for
only
the
second
time
we
were
invited
and
arrived
at
the
appointed
hour
the
company
was
not
large
some
played
and
some
walked
as
usual
afterwards
when
they
were
to
go
to
supper
i
saw
our
hostess
and
her
sister
speaking
to
each
other
with
animation
and
as
if
in
a
peculiar
embarrassment
i
accosted
them
and
said
i
have
indeed
no
right
ladies
to
force
myself
into
your
secrets
but
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
good
council
or
even
to
serve
you
upon
this
they
disclosed
to
me
their
painful
dilemma
namely
that
they
had
invited
twelve
persons
to
table
and
that
just
at
that
moment
a
relation
had
returned
from
a
journey
who
now
as
the
thirteenth
would
be
a
fatal
if
not
for
himself
yet
certainly
for
some
of
the
guests
the
case
is
very
easily
mended
replied
i
permit
me
to
take
my
leave
and
stipulate
for
indemnification
as
they
were
persons
of
consequence
and
they
would
by
no
means
allow
this
but
sent
about
in
the
neighbourhood
to
find
a
fourteenth
i
suffered
them
to
do
so
yet
when
i
saw
the
servant
coming
in
at
the
without
having
effected
his
errand
i
stole
away
and
spent
my
evening
pleasantly
under
the
old
of
the
wanzenau
that
this
was
richly
repaid
me
was
a
very
natural
consequence
a
certain
kind
of
general
society
is
not
to
be
thought
of
without
salzmann
renewed
the
good
instructions
of
madame
böhme
and
i
was
the
more
docile
as
i
had
really
seen
that
by
this
little
sacrifice
if
it
be
one
one
may
procure
oneself
much
pleasure
and
even
a
greater
freedom
in
society
than
one
would
otherwise
enjoy
the
old
piquet
which
had
gone
to
sleep
was
again
looked
out
i
learned
whist
i
made
myself
according
to
the
directions
of
my
mentor
a
which
was
to
remain
untouched
under
all
circumstances
and
i
now
found
opportunity
to
spend
most
of
my
evenings
with
my
friend
in
the
best
circles
where
for
the
most
part
they
wished
me
well
and
pardoned
many
a
little
irregularity
to
which
nevertheless
my
friend
though
kindly
enough
used
to
call
my
attention
but
that
i
might
experience
symbolically
how
much
one
even
in
externals
has
to
adapt
oneself
to
society
and
direct
oneself
according
to
it
i
was
compelled
to
something
which
seemed
to
me
the
most
disagreeable
thing
in
the
world
i
had
really
very
fine
hair
but
my
strasburg
at
once
assured
me
that
it
was
cut
much
too
short
behind
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
a
of
it
in
which
i
could
show
myself
since
nothing
but
a
few
short
curls
in
front
were
decreed
lawful
and
all
the
rest
from
the
crown
must
be
tied
up
in
a
queue
or
a
nothing
was
left
but
to
put
up
with
false
hair
till
the
natural
growth
was
again
restored
according
to
the
demands
of
the
time
he
promised
me
that
nobody
should
ever
remark
this
innocent
cheat
against
which
i
objected
at
first
very
earnestly
if
i
could
resolve
upon
it
immediately
he
kept
his
word
and
i
was
always
looked
upon
as
the
young
man
who
had
the
best
and
the
head
of
hair
but
as
i
was
obliged
to
remain
thus
propped
up
and
powdered
from
early
in
the
morning
and
at
the
same
time
to
take
care
not
to
betray
my
false
ornament
by
heating
myself
or
by
violent
motions
this
restraint
in
fact
contributed
much
to
my
behaving
for
a
time
more
quietly
and
politely
and
accustomed
me
to
going
with
my
hat
under
my
arm
and
consequently
in
shoes
and
stockings
also
however
i
did
not
venture
to
neglect
wearing
understockings
of
fine
leather
as
a
defence
against
the
rhine
gnats
which
on
the
fine
summer
evenings
generally
spread
themselves
over
the
meadows
and
gardens
if
now
under
these
circumstances
a
violent
bodily
motion
was
denied
me
our
social
conversations
certainly
became
more
and
more
animated
and
impassioned
indeed
they
were
the
most
interesting
in
which
i
had
hitherto
ever
borne
part
with
my
way
of
feeling
and
thinking
it
cost
me
nothing
to
let
every
one
pass
for
what
he
was
nay
for
that
which
he
wished
to
pass
for
and
thus
the
frankness
of
a
fresh
youthful
heart
which
manifested
itself
almost
for
the
first
time
in
its
full
bloom
made
me
many
friends
and
adherents
our
company
of
boarders
increased
to
about
twenty
persons
and
as
salzmann
kept
up
his
accustomed
order
everything
continued
in
its
old
routine
nay
the
conversation
was
almost
more
decorous
as
every
one
had
to
be
on
his
guard
before
several
among
the
new
comers
was
a
man
who
particularly
interested
me
his
name
was
jung
the
same
who
afterwards
became
known
under
the
name
of
stilling
in
spite
of
an
antiquated
dress
his
form
had
something
delicate
about
it
with
a
certain
sturdiness
a
did
not
disfigure
his
significant
and
pleasing
countenance
his
voice
was
mild
without
being
soft
and
weak
it
became
even
melodious
and
powerful
as
soon
as
his
ardour
was
roused
which
was
very
easily
done
on
learning
to
know
him
better
one
found
in
him
a
sound
which
rested
on
feeling
and
therefore
took
its
tone
from
the
affections
and
passions
and
from
this
very
feeling
sprang
an
enthusiasm
for
the
good
the
true
and
the
just
in
the
greatest
possible
purity
for
the
course
of
this
man
life
had
been
very
simple
and
yet
crowded
with
events
and
with
manifold
activity
the
element
of
his
energy
was
an
indestructible
faith
in
god
and
in
an
assistance
flowing
immediately
from
him
which
evidently
manifested
itself
in
an
uninterrupted
providence
and
in
an
unfailing
deliverance
out
of
all
troubles
and
from
every
evil
jung
had
made
many
such
experiences
in
his
life
and
they
had
often
been
repeated
of
late
in
strasburg
so
that
with
the
greatest
cheerfulness
he
led
a
life
frugal
indeed
but
free
from
care
and
devoted
himself
most
earnestly
to
his
studies
although
he
could
not
reckon
upon
any
certain
subsistence
from
one
quarter
to
another
in
his
youth
when
on
a
fair
way
to
become
a
charcoal
burner
he
took
up
the
trade
of
a
tailor
and
after
he
had
instructed
himself
at
the
same
time
in
higher
matters
his
mind
drove
him
to
the
occupation
of
schoolmaster
this
attempt
failed
and
he
returned
to
his
trade
from
which
however
since
every
one
felt
for
him
confidence
and
affection
he
was
repeatedly
called
away
again
to
take
a
place
as
private
tutor
but
for
his
most
internal
and
peculiar
training
he
had
to
thank
that
class
of
men
who
sought
out
their
salvation
on
their
own
responsibility
and
who
while
they
strove
to
edify
themselves
by
reading
the
scriptures
and
good
books
and
by
mutual
exhortation
and
confession
thereby
attained
a
degree
of
cultivation
which
must
excite
surprise
for
while
the
interest
which
always
accompanied
them
and
which
maintained
them
in
fellowship
rested
on
the
simplest
foundation
of
morality
and
the
deviations
which
could
take
place
with
men
of
such
limited
circumstances
were
of
little
importance
and
hence
their
consciences
for
the
most
part
remained
clear
and
their
minds
commonly
cheerful
so
there
arose
no
artificial
but
a
truly
natural
culture
which
yet
had
this
advantage
over
others
that
it
was
suitable
to
all
ages
and
ranks
and
was
generally
social
by
its
nature
for
this
reason
too
these
persons
were
in
their
own
circle
truly
eloquent
and
capable
of
expressing
themselves
appropriately
and
pleasingly
on
all
the
tenderest
and
best
concerns
of
the
heart
now
the
good
jung
was
in
this
very
case
among
a
few
persons
who
if
not
exactly
with
himself
did
not
declare
themselves
averse
from
his
mode
of
thought
he
was
found
not
only
talkative
but
eloquent
in
particular
he
related
the
history
of
his
life
in
the
most
delightful
manner
and
knew
how
to
make
all
the
circumstances
plainly
and
vividly
present
to
his
listeners
i
persuaded
him
to
write
them
down
and
he
promised
he
would
do
so
but
because
in
his
way
of
expressing
himself
he
was
like
a
somnambulist
whom
one
dare
not
call
lest
should
fall
from
his
elevation
or
like
a
gentle
stream
to
which
one
dare
oppose
nothing
lest
it
should
foam
so
was
often
constrained
to
feel
uncomfortable
in
a
more
numerous
company
his
faith
tolerated
no
doubt
and
his
conviction
no
jest
and
if
in
friendly
communication
he
was
inexhaustible
everything
came
to
a
standstill
with
him
when
he
suffered
contradiction
i
usually
helped
him
through
on
such
occasions
for
which
he
repaid
me
with
honest
affection
since
his
mode
of
thought
was
nothing
strange
to
me
but
on
the
contrary
i
had
already
become
accurately
acquainted
with
it
in
my
very
best
friends
of
both
sexes
and
since
moreover
it
generally
interested
me
with
its
naturalness
and
he
found
himself
on
the
very
best
terms
with
me
the
bent
of
his
intellect
was
pleasing
to
me
and
his
faith
in
miracles
which
was
so
useful
to
him
i
left
unmolested
salzmann
likewise
behaved
towards
him
with
forbearance
i
say
with
forbearance
for
salzmann
in
conformity
with
his
character
his
natural
disposition
his
age
and
circumstances
could
not
but
stand
and
continue
on
the
side
of
the
rational
or
rather
the
christians
whose
religion
properly
rested
on
the
rectitude
of
their
characters
and
a
manly
independence
and
who
therefore
did
not
like
to
meddle
or
have
anything
to
do
with
feelings
which
might
easily
have
led
them
into
gloom
or
with
mysticism
which
might
easily
have
led
them
into
the
dark
this
class
too
was
respectable
and
numerous
all
men
of
honour
and
capacity
understood
each
other
and
were
of
the
like
persuasion
as
well
as
of
the
same
mode
of
life
lerse
lerse
likewise
our
also
belonged
to
this
number
a
perfectly
upright
young
man
and
with
limited
gifts
of
fortune
frugal
and
exact
his
manner
of
life
and
housekeeping
was
the
closest
i
ever
knew
among
students
he
dressed
himself
the
neatest
of
us
all
and
yet
always
appeared
in
the
same
clothes
but
he
managed
his
wardrobe
with
the
greatest
care
kept
everything
about
him
clean
and
required
all
things
in
ordinary
life
to
go
according
to
his
example
he
never
happened
to
lean
anywhere
or
to
prop
his
elbow
on
the
table
he
never
forgot
to
mark
his
and
it
always
went
ill
with
the
maid
when
the
chairs
were
not
found
perfectly
clean
with
all
this
he
had
nothing
stiff
in
his
exterior
he
spoke
cordially
with
precise
and
dry
liveliness
in
which
a
light
ironical
joke
was
very
becoming
in
figure
he
was
slender
and
of
fair
height
his
face
was
and
homely
his
little
blue
eyes
cheerful
and
penetrating
as
he
had
cause
to
tutor
us
in
so
many
respects
we
let
him
be
our
besides
for
he
drew
a
very
fine
rapier
and
it
seemed
to
give
him
sport
to
play
off
upon
us
on
this
occasion
all
the
pedantry
of
this
profession
moreover
we
really
profited
by
him
and
had
to
thank
him
for
many
sociable
hours
which
he
induced
us
to
spend
in
good
exercise
and
practice
by
all
these
peculiarities
lerse
completely
qualified
himself
for
the
office
of
arbitrator
and
umpire
in
all
the
small
and
great
quarrels
which
happened
though
but
rarely
in
our
circle
and
which
salzmann
could
not
hush
up
in
his
fatherly
way
without
the
external
forms
which
do
so
much
mischief
in
universities
we
represented
a
society
bound
together
by
circumstances
and
which
others
might
occasionally
touch
but
into
which
they
could
not
intrude
now
in
his
judgment
of
internal
piques
lerse
always
showed
the
greatest
impartiality
and
when
the
affair
could
no
longer
be
settled
by
words
and
explanations
he
knew
how
to
conduct
the
desired
satisfaction
in
an
honourable
way
to
a
harmless
issue
in
this
no
man
was
more
clever
than
he
indeed
he
often
used
to
say
that
since
heaven
had
destined
him
for
a
hero
neither
in
war
nor
in
love
he
would
be
content
both
in
romances
and
fighting
with
the
part
of
second
since
he
remained
the
same
throughout
and
might
be
regarded
as
a
true
model
of
a
good
and
steady
disposition
the
conception
of
him
stamped
itself
as
deeply
as
amiably
upon
me
and
when
i
wrote
von
i
felt
myself
induced
to
set
up
a
memorial
of
our
friendship
and
to
give
the
gallant
fellow
who
knew
how
to
subordinate
himself
in
so
dignified
a
manner
the
name
of
franz
lerse
subjugation
of
natural
antipathies
while
now
by
his
constant
humorous
dryness
he
continued
always
to
remind
us
of
what
one
owed
to
oneself
and
to
others
and
how
one
ought
to
behave
in
order
to
live
at
peace
with
men
as
long
as
possible
and
thus
gain
a
certain
position
towards
them
i
had
to
fight
both
inwardly
and
outwardly
with
quite
different
circumstances
and
adversaries
being
at
strife
with
myself
with
the
objects
around
me
and
even
with
the
elements
i
found
myself
in
a
state
of
health
which
furthered
me
sufficiently
in
all
that
i
would
and
should
undertake
only
there
was
a
certain
irritability
left
behind
which
did
not
always
let
me
be
in
equilibrium
a
loud
sound
was
disagreeable
to
me
diseased
objects
awakened
in
me
loathing
and
horror
but
i
was
especially
troubled
by
a
giddiness
which
came
over
me
every
time
that
i
looked
down
from
a
height
all
these
infirmities
i
tried
to
remedy
and
indeed
as
i
wished
to
lose
no
time
in
a
somewhat
violent
way
in
the
evening
when
they
beat
the
tattoo
i
went
near
the
multitude
of
drums
the
powerful
rolling
and
beating
of
which
might
have
made
heart
burst
in
one
bosom
all
alone
i
ascended
the
highest
pinnacle
of
the
minster
spire
and
sat
in
what
is
called
the
neck
under
the
nob
or
crown
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
i
would
venture
to
step
out
again
into
the
open
air
where
standing
upon
a
platform
scarce
an
ell
square
without
any
particular
holding
one
sees
the
boundless
prospect
before
while
the
nearest
objects
and
ornaments
conceal
the
church
and
everything
upon
and
above
which
one
stands
it
is
exactly
as
if
one
saw
oneself
carried
up
into
the
air
in
a
balloon
such
troublesome
and
painful
sensations
i
repeated
until
the
impression
became
quite
indifferent
to
me
and
i
have
since
then
derived
great
advantage
from
this
training
in
mountain
travels
and
geological
studies
and
on
great
buildings
where
i
have
vied
with
the
carpenters
in
running
over
the
bare
beams
and
the
cornices
of
the
edifice
and
even
in
rome
where
one
must
run
similar
risks
to
obtain
a
nearer
view
of
important
works
of
art
anatomy
also
was
of
double
value
to
me
as
it
taught
me
to
tolerate
the
most
repulsive
sights
while
i
satisfied
my
thirst
for
knowledge
and
thus
i
attended
also
the
clinical
course
of
the
elder
doctor
ehrmann
as
well
as
the
lectures
of
his
son
on
obstetrics
with
the
double
view
of
becoming
acquainted
with
all
conditions
and
of
freeing
myself
from
all
apprehension
as
to
repulsive
things
and
i
have
actually
succeeded
so
far
that
nothing
of
this
kind
could
ever
put
me
out
of
my
but
i
sought
to
steel
myself
not
only
against
these
impressions
on
the
senses
but
also
against
the
infections
of
the
imagination
the
awful
and
shuddering
impressions
of
the
darkness
in
churchyards
solitary
places
churches
and
chapels
by
night
and
whatever
may
be
connected
with
them
i
contrived
to
render
likewise
indifferent
and
in
this
also
i
went
so
far
that
day
and
night
and
every
locality
were
quite
the
same
to
me
so
that
even
when
in
later
times
a
desire
came
over
me
once
more
to
feel
in
such
scenes
the
pleasing
shudder
of
youth
i
could
scarcely
force
this
in
any
degree
by
the
strangest
and
most
fearful
images
which
i
called
up
in
my
efforts
to
free
myself
from
the
pressure
of
the
and
powerful
which
continued
to
rule
within
me
and
seemed
to
me
sometimes
as
strength
sometimes
as
weakness
i
was
thoroughly
assisted
by
that
open
social
stirring
manner
of
life
which
attracted
me
more
and
more
to
which
i
accustomed
myself
and
which
i
at
last
learned
to
enjoy
with
perfect
freedom
it
is
not
difficult
to
remark
in
the
world
that
man
feels
himself
most
freely
and
most
perfectly
rid
of
his
own
failings
when
he
represents
to
himself
the
faults
of
others
and
expatiates
upon
them
with
complacent
censoriousness
it
is
a
tolerably
pleasant
sensation
even
to
set
ourselves
above
our
equals
by
disapprobation
and
misrepresentation
for
which
reason
good
society
whether
it
consists
of
few
or
many
is
most
delighted
with
it
but
nothing
equals
the
comfortable
when
we
erect
ourselves
into
judges
of
our
superiors
and
of
those
who
are
set
over
us
of
princes
and
statesmen
when
we
find
public
institutions
unfit
and
injudicious
only
consider
the
possible
and
actual
obstacles
and
recognise
neither
the
greatness
of
the
invention
nor
the
which
is
to
be
expected
from
time
and
circumstances
in
every
undertaking
whoever
remembers
the
condition
of
the
french
kingdom
and
is
accurately
and
circumstantially
acquainted
with
it
from
later
writings
will
easily
figure
to
himself
how
at
that
time
in
the
alsatian
people
used
to
talk
about
the
king
and
his
ministers
about
the
court
and
these
were
new
subjects
for
my
love
of
instructing
myself
and
very
welcome
ones
to
my
pertness
and
youthful
conceit
i
observed
everything
accurately
noted
it
down
industriously
and
i
now
see
from
the
little
that
is
left
that
such
accounts
although
only
put
together
on
the
moment
out
of
fables
and
uncertain
general
rumours
always
have
a
certain
value
in
because
they
serve
to
confront
and
compare
the
secret
made
known
at
last
with
what
was
then
already
discovered
and
public
and
the
judgments
of
contemporaries
true
or
false
with
the
convictions
of
posterity
striking
and
daily
before
the
eyes
of
us
was
the
project
for
beautifying
the
city
the
execution
of
which
according
to
draughts
and
plans
began
in
the
strangest
fashion
to
pass
from
sketches
and
plans
into
reality
intendant
gayot
had
undertaken
to
the
angular
and
uneven
lanes
of
strasburg
and
to
lay
the
foundations
of
a
respectable
handsome
city
regulated
by
line
and
level
upon
this
blondel
a
parisian
architect
drew
a
plan
by
which
an
hundred
and
forty
householders
gained
in
room
eighty
lost
and
the
rest
remained
in
their
former
condition
this
plan
accepted
but
not
to
be
put
into
execution
at
once
now
should
in
course
of
time
have
been
approaching
completion
and
meanwhile
the
city
oddly
enough
wavered
between
form
and
formlessness
if
for
instance
a
crooked
side
of
a
street
was
to
be
straightened
the
first
man
who
felt
disposed
to
build
moved
forward
to
the
appointed
line
perhaps
too
his
next
neighbour
but
perhaps
also
the
third
or
fourth
resident
from
him
by
which
projections
the
most
awkward
recesses
were
left
front
before
the
houses
in
the
background
they
would
not
use
force
yet
without
compulsion
they
would
never
have
got
on
on
which
account
no
man
when
his
house
was
once
condemned
ventured
to
improve
or
replace
anything
that
related
to
the
street
all
these
strange
accidental
inconveniences
gave
to
us
rambling
idlers
the
most
welcome
opportunity
of
practising
our
ridicule
of
making
proposals
in
the
manner
of
behrisch
for
accelerating
the
completion
and
of
constantly
doubting
the
possibility
of
it
although
many
a
handsome
building
should
have
brought
us
to
other
thoughts
how
far
that
project
was
advanced
by
the
length
of
time
i
can
not
say
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
another
subject
on
which
the
protestant
strasburgers
liked
to
converse
was
the
expulsion
of
the
jesuits
these
fathers
as
soon
as
the
city
had
fallen
to
the
share
of
the
french
had
made
their
appearance
and
sought
a
but
they
soon
extended
themselves
and
built
a
magnificent
college
which
bordered
so
closely
on
the
minster
that
the
back
of
the
church
covered
a
third
part
of
its
front
it
was
to
be
a
complete
quadrangle
and
have
a
garden
in
the
middle
three
sides
of
it
were
finished
it
is
of
stone
and
solid
like
all
the
buildings
of
these
fathers
that
the
protestants
were
pushed
hard
if
not
oppressed
by
them
lay
in
the
plan
of
the
society
which
made
it
a
duty
to
restore
the
old
religion
in
its
whole
compass
their
fall
therefore
awakened
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
the
opposite
party
and
people
saw
not
without
pleasure
how
they
sold
their
wines
carried
away
their
books
and
the
building
was
assigned
to
another
perhaps
less
active
order
how
glad
are
men
when
they
get
rid
of
an
opponent
or
only
of
a
guardian
and
the
herd
does
not
reflect
that
where
there
is
no
dog
it
is
exposed
to
wolves
now
since
every
city
must
have
its
tragedy
at
which
children
and
children
children
shudder
so
in
strasburg
frequent
mention
was
made
of
the
unfortunate
prætor
klingling
who
after
he
had
mounted
the
highest
step
of
earthly
felicity
ruled
city
and
country
with
almost
absolute
power
and
enjoyed
all
that
wealth
rank
and
influence
could
afford
had
at
last
lost
the
favour
of
the
court
and
was
dragged
up
to
answer
for
all
in
which
he
had
been
indulged
hitherto
nay
was
even
thrown
into
prison
where
more
than
seventy
years
old
he
died
an
ambiguous
death
the
knight
of
st
louis
this
and
other
tales
that
knight
of
louis
our
knew
how
to
tell
with
passion
and
animation
for
which
reason
i
was
fond
of
accompanying
him
in
his
walks
unlike
the
others
who
avoided
such
invitations
and
left
me
alone
with
him
as
with
new
acquaintances
i
generally
suffered
myself
to
go
on
for
a
long
time
without
thinking
much
about
them
or
the
effect
which
they
were
exercising
upon
me
so
i
only
remarked
gradually
that
his
stories
and
opinions
rather
unsettled
and
confused
than
instructed
and
enlightened
me
i
never
knew
what
to
make
of
him
although
the
riddle
might
easily
have
been
solved
he
belonged
to
the
many
to
whom
life
offers
no
results
and
who
therefore
from
first
to
last
exert
themselves
on
individual
objects
unfortunately
he
had
with
this
a
decided
desire
nay
even
passion
for
meditating
without
having
any
capacity
for
thinking
and
in
such
men
a
particular
notion
easily
fixes
itself
fast
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
mental
disease
to
such
a
fixed
view
he
always
came
back
again
and
was
thus
in
the
excessively
tiresome
he
used
bitterly
to
complain
of
the
decline
of
his
memory
especially
with
regard
to
the
latest
events
and
maintained
by
a
logic
of
his
own
that
all
virtue
springs
from
a
good
memory
and
all
vice
on
the
contrary
from
forgetfulness
this
doctrine
he
contrived
to
carry
out
with
much
acuteness
as
indeed
everything
can
be
maintained
when
one
permits
oneself
to
use
words
altogether
vaguely
and
to
employ
and
apply
them
in
a
sense
now
wider
now
narrower
now
closer
now
more
remote
at
first
it
was
amusing
to
hear
him
nay
his
persuasiveness
even
astonished
us
we
fancied
we
were
standing
before
a
rhetorical
sophist
who
for
jest
and
practice
knew
how
to
give
a
fair
appearance
to
the
strangest
things
unfortunately
this
first
impression
blunted
itself
but
too
soon
for
at
the
end
of
every
discourse
manage
the
thing
as
i
would
the
man
came
back
again
to
the
same
theme
he
was
not
to
be
held
fast
to
older
events
although
they
interested
him
he
had
them
present
to
his
mind
with
their
minutest
circumstances
indeed
he
was
often
by
a
small
circumstance
snatched
out
of
the
middle
of
a
wild
historical
narrative
and
thrust
into
his
detestable
favourite
thought
one
of
our
afternoon
walks
was
particularly
unfortunate
in
this
respect
the
account
of
it
may
stand
here
instead
of
similar
cases
which
might
weary
if
not
vex
the
reader
on
the
way
through
the
city
we
were
met
by
an
old
female
mendicant
who
by
her
beggings
and
importunities
disturbed
him
in
his
story
pack
yourself
off
old
witch
said
he
and
walked
by
she
shouted
after
him
the
retort
only
somewhat
changed
since
she
saw
well
that
the
unfriendly
man
was
old
himself
if
you
did
not
wish
to
be
old
you
should
have
had
yourself
hanged
in
your
youth
he
turned
round
violently
and
i
feared
a
scene
hanged
cried
he
have
myself
hanged
no
that
could
not
have
been
i
was
too
honest
a
fellow
for
that
but
hang
myself
hang
up
my
own
self
that
is
true
that
i
should
have
done
i
should
have
turned
a
charge
of
powder
against
myself
that
i
might
not
live
to
see
that
i
am
not
even
worth
that
any
more
the
woman
stood
as
if
petrified
but
he
continued
you
have
said
a
great
truth
and
as
they
have
neither
drowned
nor
burned
you
yet
you
shall
be
paid
for
your
proverb
he
handed
her
a
a
coin
not
usually
given
to
a
beggar
we
had
crossed
over
the
first
and
were
going
to
the
inn
where
we
meant
to
stop
and
i
was
trying
to
lead
him
back
to
our
previous
conversation
when
unexpectedly
a
very
pretty
girl
met
us
on
the
pleasant
remained
standing
before
us
bowed
prettily
and
cried
eh
eh
captain
where
are
you
going
and
whatever
else
is
usually
said
on
such
an
occasion
mademoiselle
replied
he
somewhat
embarrassed
i
know
not
how
said
she
with
graceful
astonishment
do
you
forget
your
friends
so
soon
the
word
forget
fretted
him
he
shook
his
head
and
replied
peevishly
enough
truly
mademoiselle
i
did
not
know
she
now
retorted
with
some
humour
yet
very
temperately
take
care
captain
i
may
mistake
you
another
time
and
so
she
hurried
past
taking
huge
strides
without
looking
round
at
once
my
struck
his
forehead
with
both
his
fists
o
what
an
ass
i
am
exclaimed
he
what
an
old
ass
i
am
now
you
see
whether
i
am
right
or
not
and
then
in
a
very
violent
manner
he
went
on
with
his
usual
sayings
and
opinions
in
which
this
case
still
more
confirmed
him
i
can
not
and
would
not
repeat
what
a
philippic
discourse
he
held
against
himself
at
last
he
turned
to
me
and
said
i
call
you
to
witness
you
remember
that
woman
at
the
corner
who
is
neither
young
nor
pretty
i
salute
her
every
time
we
pass
and
often
exchange
a
couple
of
friendly
words
with
her
and
yet
it
is
thirty
years
ago
since
she
was
gracious
to
me
but
now
i
swear
it
is
not
four
weeks
since
this
young
lady
showed
herself
more
complaisant
to
me
than
was
reasonable
and
yet
i
will
not
recognise
her
but
insult
her
in
return
for
her
favours
do
i
not
always
say
that
ingratitude
is
the
greatest
of
vices
and
no
man
would
be
ungrateful
if
he
were
not
forgetful
we
went
into
the
inn
and
nothing
but
the
tippling
swarming
crowd
in
the
stopped
the
invectives
which
he
rattled
off
against
himself
and
his
contemporaries
he
was
silent
and
i
hoped
pacified
when
we
stepped
into
an
upper
chamber
where
we
found
a
young
man
pacing
up
and
down
alone
whom
the
captain
saluted
by
name
i
was
pleased
to
become
acquainted
with
him
for
the
old
fellow
had
said
much
good
of
him
to
me
and
had
told
me
that
this
young
man
being
employed
in
the
had
often
disinterestedly
done
him
very
good
service
when
the
pensions
were
stopped
i
was
glad
that
the
conversation
took
a
general
turn
and
while
we
were
carrying
it
on
we
drank
a
bottle
of
wine
but
here
unluckily
another
infirmity
which
my
knight
had
in
common
with
obstinate
men
developed
itself
for
as
on
the
whole
he
could
not
get
rid
of
that
fixed
notion
so
did
he
stick
fast
to
a
disagreeable
impression
of
the
moment
and
suffer
his
feelings
to
run
on
without
moderation
his
last
vexation
about
himself
had
not
yet
died
away
and
now
was
added
something
new
although
of
quite
a
different
kind
he
had
not
long
cast
his
eyes
here
and
there
before
he
noticed
on
the
table
a
double
portion
of
coffee
and
two
cups
and
might
besides
being
a
man
of
gallantry
have
traced
some
other
indication
that
the
young
man
had
not
been
so
solitary
all
the
time
and
scarcely
had
the
conjecture
arisen
in
his
mind
and
ripened
into
a
probability
that
the
pretty
girl
had
been
paying
a
visit
here
than
the
most
outrageous
jealousy
added
itself
to
that
first
vexation
so
as
completely
to
perplex
him
the
knight
of
st
louis
now
before
i
could
suspect
anything
for
i
had
hitherto
been
conversing
quite
harmlessly
with
the
young
man
the
captain
in
an
unpleasant
tone
which
i
well
knew
began
to
be
satirical
about
the
pair
of
cups
and
about
this
and
that
the
young
man
surprised
tried
to
turn
it
off
pleasantly
and
sensibly
as
is
the
custom
among
men
of
but
the
old
fellow
continued
to
be
unmercifully
rude
so
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
the
other
to
do
but
to
seize
his
hat
and
cane
and
at
his
departure
to
leave
behind
him
a
pretty
unequivocal
challenge
the
fury
of
the
captain
now
burst
out
the
more
vehemently
as
he
had
in
the
interim
drunk
another
bottle
of
wine
almost
by
himself
he
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
and
cried
more
than
once
i
strike
him
dead
it
was
not
however
meant
quite
so
badly
as
it
sounded
for
he
often
used
this
phrase
when
any
one
opposed
or
otherwise
displeased
him
just
as
unexpectedly
the
business
grew
worse
on
our
return
for
i
had
the
want
of
foresight
to
represent
to
him
his
ingratitude
towards
the
young
man
and
to
remind
him
how
strongly
he
had
praised
to
me
the
ready
obligingness
of
this
official
person
no
such
rage
of
a
man
against
himself
i
never
saw
again
it
was
the
most
passionate
conclusion
to
that
beginning
to
which
the
pretty
girl
had
given
occasion
here
i
saw
sorrow
and
repentance
carried
into
caricature
and
as
all
passion
supplies
the
place
of
genius
to
a
point
really
he
then
went
over
all
the
incidents
of
our
afternoon
ramble
again
employed
them
rhetorically
for
his
own
brought
up
the
old
witch
at
last
before
him
once
more
and
perplexed
himself
to
such
a
degree
that
i
could
not
help
he
would
throw
himself
into
the
rhine
could
i
have
been
sure
of
fishing
him
out
again
quickly
like
mentor
his
telemachus
he
might
have
made
the
leap
and
i
should
have
brought
him
home
cooled
down
for
this
occasion
i
immediately
confided
the
affair
to
lerse
and
we
went
the
next
morning
to
the
young
man
whom
my
friend
in
his
dry
way
set
laughing
we
agreed
to
bring
about
an
accidental
meeting
where
a
reconciliation
should
take
place
of
itself
the
drollest
thing
about
it
was
that
this
time
the
captain
too
had
slept
off
his
rudeness
and
found
himself
ready
to
apologize
to
the
young
man
to
whom
petty
quarrels
were
of
some
consequence
all
was
arranged
in
one
morning
and
as
the
affair
had
not
been
kept
quite
secret
i
did
not
escape
the
jokes
of
my
friends
who
might
have
foretold
me
from
their
own
experience
how
troublesome
the
friendship
of
the
captain
could
become
upon
occasion
but
now
while
i
am
thinking
what
should
be
imparted
next
there
comes
again
into
my
thoughts
by
a
strange
play
of
memory
that
reverend
to
which
in
those
days
i
devoted
particular
attention
and
which
in
general
constantly
presents
itself
to
the
eye
both
in
the
city
and
in
the
country
the
more
i
considered
the
the
more
was
that
first
impression
strengthened
and
developed
that
here
the
sublime
has
entered
into
alliance
with
the
pleasing
if
the
vast
when
it
appears
as
a
mass
before
us
is
not
to
terrify
if
it
is
not
to
confuse
when
we
seek
to
investigate
its
details
it
must
enter
into
an
unnatural
apparently
impossible
connexion
it
must
associate
to
itself
the
pleasing
but
now
since
it
will
be
impossible
for
us
to
speak
of
the
impression
of
the
minster
except
by
considering
both
these
incompatible
qualities
as
united
so
do
we
already
see
from
this
in
what
high
value
we
must
hold
this
ancient
monument
and
we
begin
in
earnest
to
describe
how
such
contradictory
elements
could
peaceably
interpenetrate
and
unite
themselves
strasburg
minster
first
of
all
without
thinking
of
the
towers
we
devote
our
considerations
to
the
alone
which
powerfully
strikes
the
eye
as
an
upright
oblong
parallelogram
if
we
approach
it
at
twilight
in
the
moonshine
on
a
starlight
night
when
the
parts
appear
more
or
less
indistinct
and
at
last
disappear
we
see
only
a
colossal
wall
the
height
of
which
bears
an
advantageous
proportion
to
the
breadth
if
we
gaze
on
it
by
day
and
by
the
power
of
the
mind
abstract
from
the
details
we
recognise
the
front
of
a
building
which
not
only
incloses
the
space
within
but
also
covers
much
in
its
vicinity
the
openings
of
this
monstrous
surface
point
to
internal
necessities
and
according
to
these
we
can
at
once
divide
it
into
nine
compartments
the
great
middle
door
which
opens
into
the
nave
of
the
church
first
meets
the
eye
on
both
sides
of
it
lie
two
smaller
ones
belonging
to
the
over
the
chief
door
our
glance
falls
upon
the
window
which
is
to
spread
an
light
within
the
church
and
its
vaulted
arches
at
its
sides
appear
two
large
perpendicular
oblong
openings
which
form
a
striking
contrast
with
the
middle
one
and
indicate
that
they
belong
to
the
base
of
the
rising
towers
in
the
third
story
are
three
openings
in
a
row
which
are
designed
for
belfries
and
other
church
necessities
above
them
one
sees
the
whole
horizontally
closed
by
the
balustrade
of
the
gallery
instead
of
a
cornice
these
nine
spaces
described
are
supported
enclosed
and
separated
into
three
great
perpendicular
divisions
by
four
pillars
rising
up
from
the
ground
now
as
one
can
not
deny
to
the
whole
mass
a
fine
proportion
of
height
to
breadth
so
also
in
the
details
it
maintains
a
somewhat
uniform
lightness
by
means
of
these
pillars
and
the
narrow
compartments
between
them
but
if
we
keep
to
our
abstraction
and
imagine
to
ourselves
this
immense
wall
without
ornaments
with
firm
buttresses
with
the
necessary
openings
in
it
but
only
so
far
as
necessity
requires
them
we
even
then
must
allow
that
these
chief
divisions
are
in
good
proportion
thus
the
whole
will
appear
solemn
and
noble
indeed
but
always
heavily
unpleasant
and
being
without
ornament
unartistical
for
a
work
of
art
the
whole
of
which
is
conceived
in
great
simple
harmonious
parts
makes
indeed
a
noble
and
dignified
impression
but
the
peculiar
enjoyment
which
the
pleasing
produces
can
only
find
place
in
the
consonance
of
all
developed
details
and
it
is
precisely
here
that
the
building
which
we
are
examining
satisfies
us
in
the
highest
degree
for
we
see
all
the
ornaments
fully
suited
to
every
part
which
they
adorn
they
are
subordinate
to
it
they
seem
to
have
grown
out
of
it
such
a
manifoldness
always
gives
great
pleasure
since
it
flows
of
its
own
accord
from
the
suitable
and
therefore
at
the
same
time
awakens
the
feeling
of
unity
it
is
only
in
such
cases
that
the
execution
is
prized
as
the
summit
of
art
by
such
means
now
was
a
solid
piece
of
masonry
an
impenetrable
wall
which
had
moreover
to
announce
itself
as
the
base
of
two
towers
made
to
appear
to
the
eye
as
if
resting
on
itself
consisting
in
itself
but
at
the
same
time
light
and
adorned
and
though
pierced
through
in
a
thousand
places
to
give
the
idea
of
indestructible
firmness
this
riddle
is
solved
in
the
happiest
manner
the
openings
in
the
wall
its
solid
parts
the
pillars
everything
has
its
peculiar
character
which
proceeds
from
its
particular
destination
this
communicates
itself
by
degrees
to
the
subdivisions
hence
everything
is
adorned
in
proportionate
taste
the
great
as
well
as
the
small
is
in
the
right
place
and
can
be
easily
comprehended
and
thus
the
pleasing
presents
itself
in
the
vast
i
would
refer
only
to
the
doors
sinking
in
perspective
into
the
thickness
of
the
wall
and
adorned
without
end
in
their
columns
and
pointed
arches
to
the
window
with
its
rose
springing
out
of
the
round
form
to
the
outline
of
its
as
well
as
to
the
slender
reedlike
pillars
of
the
perpendicular
compartments
let
one
represent
to
himself
the
pillars
retreating
step
by
step
accompanied
by
little
slender
pointed
structures
likewise
striving
upwards
and
furnished
with
canopies
to
shelter
the
images
of
the
saints
and
how
at
last
every
rib
every
boss
seems
like
a
and
row
of
leaves
or
some
other
natural
object
transformed
into
stone
one
may
compare
if
not
the
building
itself
yet
representations
of
the
whole
and
of
its
parts
for
the
purpose
of
reviewing
and
giving
life
to
what
i
have
said
it
may
seem
exaggerated
to
many
for
i
myself
though
transported
into
love
for
this
work
at
first
sight
required
a
long
time
to
make
myself
intimately
acquainted
with
its
value
having
grown
up
among
those
who
found
fault
with
gothic
architecture
i
cherished
my
aversion
from
the
abundantly
overloaded
complicated
ornaments
which
by
their
capriciousness
made
a
religious
gloomy
character
highly
adverse
i
strengthened
myself
in
this
repugnance
since
i
had
only
met
with
spiritless
works
of
this
kind
in
which
one
could
perceive
neither
good
proportions
nor
a
pure
consistency
but
here
i
thought
i
saw
a
new
revelation
of
it
since
what
was
objectionable
by
no
means
appeared
but
the
contrary
opinion
rather
forced
itself
upon
my
mind
strasburg
minster
but
the
longer
i
looked
and
considered
i
all
the
while
thought
i
discovered
yet
greater
merits
beyond
that
which
i
have
already
mentioned
the
right
proportion
of
the
larger
divisions
the
ornamental
as
judicious
as
rich
even
to
the
minutest
were
found
out
but
now
i
recognised
the
connexion
of
these
manifold
ornaments
amongst
each
other
the
transition
from
one
leading
part
to
another
the
enclosing
of
details
homogeneous
indeed
but
yet
greatly
varying
in
form
from
the
saint
to
the
monster
from
the
leaf
to
the
dental
the
more
i
investigated
the
more
i
was
astonished
the
more
i
amused
and
wearied
myself
with
measuring
and
drawing
so
much
the
more
did
my
attachment
increase
so
that
i
spent
much
time
partly
in
studying
what
actually
existed
partly
in
restoring
in
my
mind
and
on
paper
what
was
wanting
and
unfinished
especially
in
the
towers
since
now
i
found
that
this
building
had
been
based
on
old
german
ground
and
grown
thus
far
in
genuine
german
times
and
that
the
name
of
the
master
on
his
modest
gravestone
was
likewise
of
native
sound
and
origin
i
ventured
being
incited
by
the
worth
of
this
work
of
art
to
change
the
hitherto
decried
appellation
of
gothic
architecture
and
to
claim
it
for
our
nation
as
german
architecture
nor
did
i
fail
to
bring
my
patriotic
views
to
light
first
orally
and
afterwards
in
a
little
treatise
dedicated
to
the
memory
of
ervinus
a
steinbach
if
my
biographical
narrative
should
come
down
to
the
epoch
when
the
said
sheet
appeared
in
print
which
herder
afterwards
inserted
in
his
pamphlet
deutscher
art
und
german
manner
and
much
more
will
be
said
on
this
weighty
subject
but
before
i
turn
myself
away
from
it
this
time
i
will
take
the
opportunity
to
vindicate
the
motto
prefixed
to
the
present
volume
with
those
who
may
have
entertained
some
doubt
about
it
i
know
indeed
very
well
that
in
opposition
to
this
honest
hopeful
old
german
saying
whatever
one
wishes
in
youth
one
has
abundance
in
old
age
many
would
quote
contrary
experience
and
many
trifling
comments
might
be
made
but
much
also
is
to
be
said
in
its
favour
and
i
will
explain
my
own
thoughts
on
the
matter
our
wishes
are
presentiments
of
the
capabilities
which
lie
within
us
and
harbingers
of
that
which
we
shall
be
in
a
condition
to
perform
whatever
we
are
able
and
would
like
to
do
presents
itself
to
our
imagination
as
without
us
and
in
the
future
we
feel
a
longing
after
that
which
we
already
possess
in
secret
thus
a
passionate
anticipating
grasp
changes
the
truly
possible
into
a
dreamed
reality
now
if
such
a
bias
lies
decidedly
in
our
nature
then
with
every
step
of
our
development
will
a
part
of
the
first
wish
be
fulfilled
under
favourable
circumstances
in
the
direct
way
under
unfavourable
in
the
circuitous
way
from
which
we
always
come
back
again
to
the
other
thus
we
see
men
by
perseverance
attain
to
earthly
wealth
they
surround
themselves
with
riches
splendour
and
external
honour
others
strive
yet
more
certainly
after
intellectual
advantages
acquire
for
themselves
a
clear
survey
of
things
a
peacefulness
of
mind
and
a
certainty
for
the
present
and
the
future
but
now
there
is
a
third
direction
which
is
compounded
of
both
and
the
issue
of
which
must
be
the
most
surely
successful
when
namely
the
youth
of
a
man
falls
into
a
pregnant
time
when
production
overweighs
destruction
and
a
presentiment
is
early
awakened
within
him
as
to
what
such
an
epoch
demands
and
promises
he
will
then
being
forced
by
outward
inducements
into
an
active
interest
take
hold
now
here
now
there
and
the
wish
to
be
active
on
many
sides
will
be
lively
within
him
but
so
many
accidental
hindrances
are
associated
with
human
limitation
that
here
a
thing
once
begun
remains
unfinished
there
that
which
is
already
grasped
falls
out
of
the
hand
and
one
wish
after
another
is
dissipated
but
had
these
wishes
sprung
out
of
a
pure
heart
and
in
conformity
with
the
necessities
of
the
times
one
might
composedly
let
them
lie
and
fall
right
and
left
and
be
assured
that
these
must
not
only
be
found
out
and
picked
up
again
but
that
also
many
kindred
things
which
one
has
never
touched
and
never
even
thought
of
will
come
to
light
if
now
during
our
own
lifetime
we
see
that
performed
by
others
to
which
we
ourselves
felt
an
earlier
call
but
had
been
obliged
to
give
it
up
with
much
besides
then
the
beautiful
feeling
enters
the
mind
that
only
mankind
together
is
the
true
man
and
that
the
individual
can
only
be
joyous
and
happy
when
he
has
the
courage
to
feel
himself
in
the
whole
study
of
german
architecture
this
contemplation
is
here
in
the
right
place
for
when
i
reflect
on
the
affection
which
drew
me
to
these
antique
edifices
when
i
reckon
up
the
time
which
i
devoted
to
the
strasburg
minster
alone
the
attention
with
which
i
afterwards
examined
the
cathedral
at
cologne
and
that
at
freyburg
and
more
and
more
felt
the
value
of
these
buildings
i
could
even
blame
myself
for
having
afterwards
lost
sight
of
them
altogether
nay
for
having
left
them
completely
in
the
background
being
attracted
by
a
more
developed
art
but
when
i
now
in
the
latest
times
see
attention
again
turned
to
those
objects
when
i
see
affection
and
even
passion
for
them
appearing
and
flourishing
when
i
see
able
young
persons
seized
with
this
passion
recklessly
devoting
powers
time
care
and
property
to
these
memorials
of
a
past
world
then
am
i
reminded
with
pleasure
that
what
i
formerly
would
and
wished
had
a
value
with
satisfaction
i
see
that
they
not
only
know
how
to
prize
what
was
done
by
our
forefathers
but
that
from
existing
unfinished
beginnings
they
try
to
represent
in
pictures
at
least
the
original
design
so
as
thus
to
make
us
acquainted
with
the
thought
which
is
ever
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
undertakings
and
that
they
strive
with
considerate
zeal
to
clear
up
and
vivify
what
seems
to
be
a
confused
past
here
i
especially
applaud
the
gallant
sulpiz
boisserée
who
is
indefatigably
employed
in
a
magnificent
series
of
to
exhibit
the
cathedral
of
cologne
as
the
model
of
those
vast
conceptions
the
spirit
of
which
like
that
of
babel
strove
up
to
heaven
and
which
were
so
out
of
proportion
to
earthly
means
that
they
were
necessarily
stopped
fast
in
their
execution
if
we
have
been
hitherto
astonished
that
such
buildings
proceeded
only
so
far
we
shall
learn
with
the
greatest
wonder
what
was
really
designed
to
be
done
may
the
undertakings
of
this
kind
be
duly
patronized
by
all
who
have
power
wealth
and
influence
that
the
great
and
gigantic
views
of
our
forefathers
may
be
presented
to
our
contemplation
and
that
we
may
be
able
to
form
a
conception
of
what
they
dared
to
desire
the
insight
resulting
from
this
will
not
remain
fruitless
and
the
judgment
will
for
once
at
least
be
in
a
condition
to
exercise
itself
on
these
works
with
justice
nay
this
will
be
done
most
thoroughly
if
our
active
young
friend
besides
the
monograph
devoted
to
the
cathedral
of
cologne
follows
out
in
detail
the
history
of
our
mediæval
architecture
when
whatever
is
to
be
known
about
the
practical
exercise
of
this
art
is
further
brought
to
light
when
the
art
is
represented
in
all
its
fundamental
features
by
a
comparison
with
the
and
the
oriental
egyptian
little
can
remain
to
be
done
in
this
department
and
i
when
the
results
of
such
patriotic
labours
lie
before
the
world
as
they
are
now
known
in
friendly
private
communications
shall
be
able
with
true
content
to
repeat
that
motto
in
its
best
sense
whatever
one
wishes
in
youth
in
old
age
one
has
abundance
but
if
in
operations
like
these
which
belong
to
centuries
one
can
trust
oneself
to
time
and
wait
for
opportunity
there
are
on
the
contrary
other
things
which
in
youth
must
be
enjoyed
at
once
fresh
like
ripe
fruits
let
me
be
permitted
with
this
sudden
turn
to
mention
dancing
of
which
the
ear
is
reminded
as
the
eye
is
of
the
minster
every
day
and
every
hour
in
strasburg
and
all
alsace
from
early
youth
my
father
himself
had
given
my
sister
and
me
instruction
in
dancing
a
task
which
must
have
comported
strangely
enough
with
so
stern
a
man
but
he
did
not
suffer
his
composure
to
be
put
out
by
it
he
drilled
us
in
the
positions
and
steps
in
a
manner
the
most
precise
and
when
he
had
brought
us
far
enough
to
dance
a
minuet
he
played
for
us
something
easily
intelligible
in
time
on
a
and
we
moved
to
it
as
well
as
we
could
on
the
french
theatre
likewise
i
had
seen
from
my
youth
upwards
if
not
ballets
yet
and
de
and
had
noticed
in
them
various
strange
motions
of
the
feet
and
all
sorts
of
springs
when
now
we
had
enough
of
the
minuet
i
begged
my
father
for
other
dancing
music
of
which
our
in
their
jigs
and
murkies
offered
us
a
rich
supply
and
i
immediately
found
out
of
myself
the
steps
and
other
motions
for
them
the
time
being
quite
suitable
to
my
limbs
and
as
it
were
born
with
them
this
pleased
my
father
to
a
certain
degree
indeed
he
often
by
way
of
joke
for
himself
and
us
let
the
monkies
dance
in
this
way
after
my
misfortune
with
gretchen
and
during
the
whole
of
my
residence
in
leipzig
i
did
not
make
my
appearance
again
on
the
floor
on
the
contrary
i
still
remember
that
when
at
a
ball
they
forced
me
into
a
minuet
both
measure
and
motion
seemed
to
have
abandoned
my
limbs
and
i
could
no
more
remember
either
the
steps
or
the
figures
so
that
i
should
have
been
put
to
disgrace
and
shame
if
the
greater
part
of
the
spectators
had
not
maintained
that
my
awkward
behaviour
was
pure
obstinacy
assumed
with
the
view
of
depriving
the
ladies
of
all
desire
to
invite
me
and
draw
me
into
their
circle
against
my
will
the
daughters
during
my
residence
in
frankfort
i
was
quite
cut
off
from
such
pleasures
but
in
strasburg
with
other
enjoyments
of
life
there
soon
arose
in
my
limbs
the
faculty
of
keeping
time
on
sundays
and
one
sauntered
by
no
without
finding
there
a
joyous
crowd
assembled
for
the
dance
and
for
the
most
part
revolving
in
the
circle
moreover
there
were
private
balls
in
the
and
people
were
already
talking
of
the
brilliant
masquerades
of
the
coming
winter
here
indeed
i
should
have
been
out
of
my
place
and
useless
to
the
company
when
a
friend
who
waltzed
very
well
advised
me
to
practise
myself
first
in
parties
of
a
lower
rank
so
that
afterwards
i
might
be
worth
something
in
the
highest
he
took
me
to
a
who
was
well
known
for
his
skill
this
man
promised
me
that
when
i
had
in
some
degree
repeated
the
first
elements
and
made
myself
master
of
them
he
would
then
lead
me
further
he
was
one
of
the
dry
ready
french
characters
and
received
me
in
a
friendly
manner
i
paid
him
a
month
in
advance
and
received
twelve
tickets
for
which
he
agreed
to
give
me
certain
instruction
the
man
was
strict
and
precise
but
not
pedantic
and
as
i
already
had
some
previous
practice
i
soon
gave
him
satisfaction
and
received
his
commendation
one
circumstance
however
greatly
facilitated
the
instruction
of
this
teacher
he
had
two
daughters
both
pretty
and
both
yet
under
twenty
having
been
instructed
in
this
art
from
their
youth
upwards
they
showed
themselves
very
skilful
and
might
have
been
able
as
partners
soon
to
help
even
the
most
clumsy
scholars
into
some
cultivation
they
were
both
very
polite
spoke
nothing
but
french
and
i
on
my
part
did
my
best
that
i
might
not
appear
awkward
or
ridiculous
before
them
i
had
the
good
fortune
that
they
likewise
praised
me
and
were
always
willing
to
dance
a
minuet
to
their
father
little
violin
and
what
indeed
was
more
difficult
for
them
to
initiate
me
by
degrees
into
waltzing
and
whirling
their
father
did
not
seem
to
have
many
customers
and
they
led
a
lonely
life
for
this
reason
they
often
asked
me
to
remain
with
them
after
my
hour
and
to
chat
away
the
time
a
little
which
i
the
more
willingly
did
as
the
younger
one
pleased
me
well
and
generally
they
both
altogether
behaved
very
becomingly
i
often
read
aloud
something
from
a
novel
and
they
did
the
same
the
elder
who
was
as
handsome
perhaps
even
handsomer
than
the
second
but
who
did
not
correspond
with
my
taste
so
well
as
the
latter
always
conducted
herself
towards
me
more
obligingly
and
more
kindly
in
every
respect
she
was
always
at
hand
during
the
hour
and
often
protracted
it
hence
i
sometimes
thought
myself
bound
to
offer
back
a
couple
of
tickets
to
her
father
which
however
he
did
not
accept
the
younger
one
on
the
contrary
although
she
did
nothing
unfriendly
towards
me
was
yet
rather
reserved
and
waited
till
she
was
called
by
her
father
before
she
relieved
the
elder
the
the
cause
of
this
became
manifest
to
me
one
evening
for
when
after
the
dance
was
done
i
was
about
to
go
into
the
with
the
elder
she
held
me
back
and
said
let
us
remain
here
a
little
longer
for
i
will
confess
to
you
that
my
sister
has
with
her
a
woman
who
tells
fortunes
from
cards
and
who
is
to
reveal
to
her
how
matters
stand
with
an
absent
lover
on
whom
her
whole
heart
hangs
and
upon
whom
she
has
placed
all
her
hope
mine
is
free
she
continued
and
i
must
accustom
myself
to
see
it
despised
i
thereupon
said
sundry
pretty
things
to
her
replying
that
she
could
at
once
convince
herself
on
that
point
by
consulting
the
wise
woman
likewise
that
i
would
do
so
myself
for
i
had
long
wished
to
learn
something
of
the
kind
but
lacked
faith
she
blamed
me
for
this
and
assured
me
that
nothing
in
the
world
was
surer
than
the
responses
of
this
oracle
only
it
must
be
consulted
not
out
of
sport
and
mischief
but
solely
in
real
affairs
however
i
at
last
compelled
her
to
go
with
me
into
that
room
as
soon
as
she
had
ascertained
that
the
consultation
was
over
we
found
her
sister
in
a
very
cheerful
humour
and
even
towards
me
she
was
kinder
than
usual
sportive
and
almost
witty
for
since
she
seemed
to
be
secure
of
an
absent
friend
she
may
have
thought
it
no
treachery
to
be
a
little
gracious
with
a
present
friend
of
her
sister
which
she
thought
me
to
be
the
old
woman
was
now
flattered
and
good
payment
was
promised
her
if
she
would
tell
the
truth
to
the
elder
sister
and
to
me
with
the
usual
preparations
and
ceremonies
she
began
her
business
in
order
to
tell
the
fair
one
fortune
first
she
carefully
considered
the
situation
of
the
cards
but
seemed
to
hesitate
and
would
not
speak
out
what
she
had
to
say
i
see
now
said
the
younger
who
was
already
better
acquainted
with
the
interpretation
of
such
a
magic
tablet
you
hesitate
and
do
not
wish
to
disclose
anything
disagreeable
to
my
sister
but
that
is
a
cursed
card
the
elder
one
turned
pale
but
composed
herself
and
said
only
speak
out
it
will
not
cost
head
the
old
woman
after
a
deep
sigh
showed
her
that
she
was
in
love
that
she
was
not
beloved
that
another
person
stood
in
the
way
and
other
things
of
like
import
we
saw
the
good
girl
embarrassment
the
old
woman
thought
somewhat
to
improve
the
affair
by
giving
hopes
of
letters
and
money
letters
said
the
lovely
child
i
do
not
expect
and
money
i
do
not
desire
if
it
is
true
as
you
say
that
i
love
i
deserve
a
heart
that
loves
me
in
return
let
us
see
if
it
will
not
be
better
replied
the
old
woman
as
she
shuffled
the
cards
and
laid
them
out
a
second
time
but
before
the
eyes
of
all
of
us
it
had
only
become
still
worse
the
fair
one
stood
not
only
more
lonely
but
surrounded
with
many
sorrows
her
lover
had
moved
somewhat
farther
and
the
intervening
figures
nearer
the
old
woman
wished
to
try
it
the
third
time
in
hopes
of
a
better
prospect
but
the
beautiful
girl
could
restrain
herself
no
longer
she
broke
out
into
uncontrollable
weeping
her
lovely
bosom
heaved
violently
she
turned
round
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
i
knew
not
what
i
should
do
inclination
kept
me
with
the
one
present
compassion
drove
me
to
the
other
my
situation
was
painful
enough
comfort
lucinda
said
the
younger
go
after
her
i
hesitated
how
could
i
comfort
her
without
at
least
assuring
her
of
some
sort
of
affection
and
could
i
do
that
at
such
a
moment
in
a
cool
moderate
manner
let
us
go
together
said
i
to
emilia
i
know
not
whether
my
presence
will
do
her
good
replied
she
yet
we
went
but
found
the
door
bolted
lucinda
made
no
answer
we
might
knock
shout
entreat
as
we
would
we
must
let
her
have
her
own
way
said
emilia
she
will
not
have
it
otherwise
now
and
indeed
when
i
called
to
my
mind
her
manner
from
our
very
first
acquaintance
she
always
had
something
violent
and
unequal
about
her
and
chiefly
showed
her
affection
for
me
by
not
behaving
to
me
with
rudeness
what
should
i
do
i
paid
the
old
woman
richly
for
the
mischief
she
had
caused
and
was
about
to
go
when
emilia
said
i
stipulate
that
the
cards
shall
now
be
cut
for
you
too
the
old
woman
was
ready
do
not
let
me
be
present
cried
i
and
hastened
down
stairs
scene
with
the
two
sisters
the
next
day
i
had
not
courage
to
go
there
the
third
day
early
in
the
morning
emilia
sent
me
word
by
a
boy
who
had
already
brought
me
many
a
message
from
the
sisters
and
had
carried
back
flowers
and
fruits
to
them
in
return
that
i
should
not
fail
that
day
i
came
at
the
usual
hour
and
found
the
father
alone
who
in
many
respects
improved
my
paces
and
steps
my
goings
and
comings
my
bearing
and
behaviour
and
moreover
seemed
to
be
satisfied
with
me
the
younger
daughter
came
in
towards
the
end
of
the
hour
and
danced
with
me
a
very
graceful
minuet
in
which
her
movements
were
extraordinarily
pleasing
and
her
father
declared
that
he
had
rarely
seen
a
prettier
and
more
nimble
pair
upon
his
floor
after
the
lesson
i
went
as
usual
into
the
the
father
left
us
alone
i
missed
lucinda
she
is
in
bed
said
emilia
and
i
am
glad
of
it
do
not
be
concerned
about
it
her
mental
illness
is
first
alleviated
when
she
fancies
herself
bodily
sick
she
does
not
like
to
die
and
therefore
she
then
does
what
we
wish
we
have
certain
family
medicines
which
she
takes
and
reposes
and
thus
by
degrees
the
swelling
waves
subside
she
is
indeed
too
good
and
amiable
in
such
an
imaginary
sickness
and
as
she
is
in
reality
very
well
and
is
only
attacked
by
passion
she
imagines
various
kinds
of
romantic
deaths
with
which
she
frightens
herself
in
a
pleasant
manner
like
children
when
we
tell
them
thus
yesterday
evening
she
announced
to
me
with
great
vehemence
that
this
time
she
should
certainly
die
and
that
only
when
she
was
really
near
death
they
should
bring
again
before
her
the
ungrateful
false
friend
who
had
at
first
acted
so
handsomely
to
her
and
now
treated
her
so
ill
she
would
reproach
him
bitterly
and
then
give
up
the
ghost
i
know
not
that
i
am
guilty
exclaimed
i
of
having
expressed
any
sort
of
affection
for
her
i
know
somebody
who
can
best
bear
me
witness
in
this
respect
emilia
smiled
and
rejoined
i
understand
you
and
if
we
are
not
discreet
and
determined
we
shall
all
find
ourselves
in
a
bad
plight
together
what
will
you
say
if
i
entreat
you
not
to
continue
your
lessons
you
have
i
believe
four
tickets
yet
of
the
last
month
and
my
father
has
already
declared
that
he
finds
it
inexcusable
to
take
your
money
any
longer
unless
you
wish
to
devote
yourself
to
the
art
of
dancing
in
a
more
serious
manner
what
is
required
by
a
young
man
of
the
world
you
possess
already
and
do
you
emilia
give
me
this
advice
to
avoid
your
house
replied
i
yes
i
do
said
she
but
not
of
myself
only
listen
when
you
hastened
away
the
day
before
yesterday
i
had
the
cards
cut
for
you
and
the
same
response
was
repeated
thrice
and
each
time
more
emphatically
you
were
surrounded
by
everything
good
and
pleasing
by
friends
and
great
lords
and
there
was
no
lack
of
money
the
ladies
kept
themselves
at
some
distance
my
poor
sister
in
particular
stood
always
the
farthest
off
one
other
advanced
constantly
nearer
to
you
but
never
came
up
to
your
side
for
a
third
person
of
the
male
sex
always
came
between
i
will
confess
to
you
that
i
thought
that
i
myself
was
meant
by
the
second
lady
and
after
this
confession
you
will
best
comprehend
my
counsel
to
an
absent
friend
i
have
promised
my
heart
and
my
hand
and
until
now
i
loved
him
above
all
yet
it
might
be
possible
for
your
presence
to
become
more
important
to
me
than
hitherto
and
what
kind
of
a
situation
would
you
have
between
two
sisters
one
of
whom
you
had
made
unhappy
by
your
affection
and
the
other
by
your
coldness
and
all
this
ado
about
nothing
and
only
for
a
short
time
for
if
we
had
not
known
already
who
you
are
and
what
are
your
expectations
the
cards
would
have
placed
it
before
my
eyes
in
the
clearest
manner
fare
you
well
said
she
and
gave
me
her
hand
i
hesitated
now
said
she
leading
me
towards
the
door
that
it
may
really
be
the
last
time
that
we
shall
speak
to
each
other
take
what
i
would
otherwise
have
denied
you
she
fell
upon
my
neck
and
kissed
me
most
tenderly
i
embraced
her
and
pressed
her
to
my
bosom
at
this
moment
the
flew
open
and
her
sister
in
a
light
but
becoming
sprang
out
and
cried
you
shall
not
be
the
only
one
to
take
leave
of
him
emilia
let
me
go
and
lucinda
seized
me
clasped
herself
fast
to
my
heart
pressed
her
black
locks
upon
my
cheeks
and
remained
in
this
position
for
some
time
and
thus
i
found
myself
in
the
dilemma
between
two
sisters
which
emilia
had
prophesied
to
me
a
moment
before
lucinda
let
me
loose
and
looked
earnestly
into
my
face
i
would
have
taken
her
hand
and
said
something
friendly
to
her
but
she
turned
herself
away
walked
with
violent
steps
up
and
down
the
room
for
some
time
and
then
threw
herself
into
a
corner
of
the
sofa
emilia
went
to
her
but
was
immediately
repulsed
and
here
began
a
scene
which
is
yet
painful
to
me
in
the
recollection
and
which
although
really
it
had
nothing
theatrical
about
it
but
was
quite
suitable
to
a
lively
young
frenchwoman
could
only
be
properly
repeated
in
the
theatre
by
a
good
and
feeling
actress
lucinda
curse
lucinda
overwhelmed
her
sister
with
a
thousand
reproaches
this
is
not
the
first
heart
she
cried
that
was
inclining
itself
to
me
and
that
you
have
turned
away
was
it
not
just
so
with
him
who
is
absent
and
who
at
last
betrothed
himself
to
you
under
my
very
eyes
i
was
compelled
to
look
on
i
endured
it
but
i
know
how
many
thousand
tears
it
has
cost
me
this
one
too
you
have
now
taken
away
from
me
without
letting
the
other
go
and
how
many
do
you
not
manage
to
keep
at
once
i
am
frank
and
and
every
one
thinks
he
knows
me
soon
and
may
neglect
me
you
are
secret
and
quiet
and
people
think
wonders
of
what
may
be
concealed
behind
you
yet
there
is
nothing
behind
but
a
cold
selfish
heart
that
can
sacrifice
everything
to
itself
this
nobody
learns
so
easily
because
it
lies
deeply
hidden
in
your
breast
and
just
as
little
do
they
know
of
my
warm
true
heart
which
i
carry
about
with
me
as
open
as
my
face
emilia
was
silent
and
had
sat
down
by
her
sister
who
became
constantly
more
and
more
excited
in
her
discourse
and
let
certain
private
matters
slip
out
which
it
was
not
exactly
proper
for
me
to
know
emilia
on
the
other
hand
who
was
trying
to
pacify
her
sister
made
me
a
sign
from
behind
that
i
should
withdraw
but
as
jealousy
and
suspicion
see
with
a
thousand
eyes
lucinda
seemed
to
have
noticed
this
also
she
sprang
up
and
advanced
to
me
but
not
with
vehemence
she
stood
before
me
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
something
then
she
said
i
know
that
i
have
lost
you
i
make
no
further
pretensions
to
you
but
neither
shall
you
have
him
sister
with
these
words
she
grasped
me
very
singularly
by
the
head
thrusting
both
her
hands
into
my
locks
pressing
my
face
to
hers
and
kissed
me
repeatedly
on
the
mouth
now
cried
she
fear
my
curse
woe
upon
woe
for
ever
and
ever
to
her
who
kisses
these
lips
for
the
first
time
after
me
dare
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
i
know
heaven
hears
me
this
time
and
you
sir
hasten
now
hasten
away
as
fast
as
you
can
i
flew
down
the
stairs
with
the
firm
determination
never
to
outer
the
house
again

class
of

they
as

in

therefore
it
was
a

of

a
poor

consciousness

and
faculties
was
forced
to
crawl
along
painfully
through
life

from

squander

not
attain
a
conception
of
their
high
value
and
a
poet
if
he
did
not
strike
altogether
into
path
appeared
in
the
world
in
the
most
melancholy
state
of
subserviency
as
a
jester
and
parasite
so
that
both
on
the
theatre
and
on
the
stage
of
life
he
represented
a
character
which
any
one
and
every
one
could
abuse
at
pleasure
if
on
the
contrary
the
muse
associated
herself
with
men
of
respectability
these
received
thereby
a
lustre
which
was
reflected
back
to
the
donor
noblemen
well
versed
in
life
like
hagedorn
dignified
citizens
like
brockes
distinguished
men
of
science
like
haller
appeared
among
the
first
in
the
nation
to
be
equal
with
the
most
eminent
and
the
most
prized
those
persons
too
were
specially
honoured
who
together
with
this
pleasing
talent
distinguished
themselves
as
active
faithful
men
of
business
in
this
way
uz
rabener
and
weisse
enjoyed
a
respect
of
quite
a
peculiar
kind
people
had
here
to
value
when
combined
those
most
heterogeneous
qualities
which
are
seldom
found
united
klopstock
but
now
the
time
was
to
come
when
poetic
genius
should
become
aware
of
itself
should
create
for
itself
its
own
relations
and
understand
how
to
lay
the
foundation
of
an
independent
dignity
everything
necessary
to
found
such
an
epoch
was
combined
in
klopstock
considered
both
from
the
sensual
and
moral
side
he
was
a
pure
young
man
seriously
and
thoroughly
educated
he
places
from
his
youth
upwards
a
great
value
upon
himself
and
upon
whatever
he
does
and
while
considerately
measuring
out
beforehand
the
steps
of
his
life
turns
with
a
presentiment
of
the
whole
strength
of
his
internal
nature
towards
the
loftiest
and
most
grateful
theme
the
a
name
which
betokens
infinite
attributes
was
to
be
glorified
afresh
by
him
the
redeemer
was
to
be
the
hero
whom
the
poet
thought
to
accompany
through
earthly
lowliness
and
sorrows
to
the
highest
heavenly
triumphs
everything
godlike
angelic
and
human
that
lay
in
the
young
soul
was
here
called
into
requisition
brought
up
by
the
bible
and
nourished
by
its
strength
he
now
lives
with
patriarchs
prophets
and
forerunners
as
if
they
were
present
yet
all
these
are
only
evoked
from
ages
to
draw
a
bright
halo
round
the
one
whose
humiliation
they
behold
with
astonishment
and
in
whose
exaltation
they
are
gloriously
to
bear
a
part
for
at
last
after
gloomy
and
horrible
hours
the
everlasting
judge
will
uncloud
his
face
again
acknowledge
his
son
and
who
on
the
other
hand
will
again
lead
to
him
alienated
men
nay
even
a
fallen
spirit
the
living
heavens
shout
with
a
thousand
angel
voices
round
the
throne
and
a
radiance
of
love
gushes
out
over
the
universe
which
shortly
before
had
fastened
its
looks
upon
a
fearful
place
of
sacrifice
the
heavenly
peace
which
klopstock
felt
in
the
conception
and
execution
of
this
poem
communicates
itself
even
now
to
every
one
who
reads
the
first
ten
cantos
without
allowing
certain
requisitions
to
be
brought
forward
which
an
advancing
cultivation
does
not
willingly
abandon
the
dignity
of
the
subject
elevated
in
the
poet
the
feeling
of
his
own
personality
that
he
himself
would
enter
hereafter
into
those
choirs
that
the
would
distinguish
him
nay
give
him
face
to
face
the
reward
for
his
labours
which
even
here
every
feeling
pious
heart
had
fondly
paid
in
many
a
pure
tear
these
were
such
innocent
childlike
thoughts
and
hopes
as
only
a
mind
can
conceive
and
cherish
thus
klopstock
gained
the
perfect
right
to
regard
himself
as
a
consecrated
person
and
thus
in
his
actions
he
studied
the
most
scrupulous
purity
even
in
his
old
age
it
troubled
him
exceedingly
that
he
had
given
his
earliest
love
to
a
lady
who
by
marrying
another
left
him
in
uncertainty
whether
she
had
really
loved
him
or
been
worthy
of
him
the
sentiments
which
bound
him
to
meta
their
hearty
tranquil
affection
their
short
sacred
married
life
the
aversion
of
the
surviving
husband
from
a
second
union
all
is
of
that
kind
which
may
well
be
remembered
hereafter
in
the
circle
of
the
blessed
this
honourable
conduct
towards
himself
was
still
further
enhanced
by
his
being
favourably
received
for
a
long
time
in
denmark
in
the
house
of
a
great
and
humanly
speaking
excellent
statesman
here
in
a
higher
circle
which
was
exclusive
indeed
but
at
the
same
time
devoted
to
external
manners
and
attention
towards
the
world
his
tendency
became
still
more
decided
a
composed
demeanour
a
measured
speech
and
a
laconism
even
when
he
spoke
openly
and
decidedly
gave
him
through
his
whole
life
a
certain
diplomatic
ministerial
consequence
which
seemed
to
be
at
variance
with
his
tender
natural
feelings
although
both
sprang
from
one
source
of
all
this
his
first
works
give
a
clear
transcript
and
type
and
they
thus
could
not
but
gain
an
incredible
influence
that
however
he
personally
assisted
others
who
were
struggling
in
life
and
poetry
has
scarcely
been
mentioned
as
one
of
his
most
decided
characteristics
klopstock
and
gleim
but
just
such
a
furtherance
of
young
people
in
literary
action
and
pursuit
a
hopeful
pleasure
in
bringing
forward
men
not
favoured
by
fortune
and
making
the
way
easy
to
them
has
rendered
illustrious
one
german
who
in
respect
to
the
dignity
which
he
gave
himself
may
be
named
as
the
second
but
in
regard
to
his
living
influence
as
the
first
it
will
escape
no
one
that
gleim
is
here
meant
in
possession
of
an
obscure
indeed
but
lucrative
office
residing
in
a
pleasantly
situated
spot
not
too
large
and
enlivened
by
military
civic
and
literary
activity
whence
proceeded
the
revenues
of
a
great
and
wealthy
institution
not
without
a
part
of
them
remaining
behind
for
the
advantage
of
the
place
he
felt
within
himself
also
a
lively
productive
impulse
which
however
with
all
its
strength
was
not
quite
enough
for
him
and
therefore
he
gave
himself
up
to
another
perhaps
stronger
impulse
namely
that
of
making
others
produce
something
both
these
activities
were
intertwined
incessantly
during
his
whole
long
life
he
could
as
easily
have
lived
without
taking
breath
as
without
writing
poetry
and
making
presents
and
by
helping
needy
talents
of
all
kinds
through
earlier
or
later
embarrassments
contributing
to
the
honour
of
literature
he
gained
so
many
friends
debtors
and
dependents
that
they
willingly
allowed
his
diffuse
verses
to
pass
since
they
could
give
him
nothing
in
return
for
his
rich
benefits
but
endurance
of
his
poetry
now
the
high
idea
which
these
two
men
might
well
form
of
their
own
worth
and
by
which
others
were
induced
also
to
think
themselves
somebody
has
produced
very
great
and
beautiful
results
both
in
public
and
private
but
this
consciousness
honourable
as
it
is
called
a
peculiar
evil
down
for
themselves
for
those
around
them
and
for
their
time
if
judging
from
their
intellectual
effects
both
these
men
may
without
hesitation
be
called
great
with
respect
to
the
world
they
remained
but
small
and
considered
in
comparison
with
a
more
stirring
life
their
external
position
was
nought
the
day
is
long
and
so
is
the
night
one
can
not
be
always
writing
poetry
or
doing
or
giving
their
time
could
not
be
filled
up
like
that
of
people
of
the
world
and
men
of
rank
and
wealth
they
therefore
set
too
high
a
value
on
their
particular
limited
situations
attached
an
importance
to
their
daily
affairs
which
they
should
only
have
allowed
themselves
amongst
each
other
and
took
more
than
reasonable
delight
in
their
own
jokes
which
though
they
made
the
moment
agreeable
could
be
of
no
consequence
in
the
end
they
received
praise
and
honour
from
others
as
they
deserved
they
gave
it
back
with
measure
indeed
but
always
too
profusely
and
because
they
felt
that
their
friendship
was
worth
much
they
were
pleased
to
express
it
repeatedly
and
in
this
spared
neither
paper
nor
ink
thus
arose
those
correspondences
at
the
deficiency
of
which
in
solid
contents
the
modern
world
wonders
nor
can
it
be
blamed
when
it
hardly
sees
the
possibility
of
eminent
men
delighting
themselves
in
such
an
interchange
of
nothing
or
when
it
expresses
the
wish
that
such
leaves
might
have
remained
unprinted
but
we
may
suffer
these
few
volumes
always
to
stand
along
with
so
many
others
upon
our
bookshelves
if
we
have
learned
from
them
the
fact
that
even
the
most
eminent
man
lives
only
by
the
day
and
enjoys
but
a
sorry
entertainment
when
he
throws
himself
too
much
back
upon
himself
and
neglects
to
grasp
into
the
fulness
of
the
external
world
where
alone
he
can
find
nourishment
for
his
growth
and
at
the
same
time
a
standard
for
its
measurement
the
activity
of
these
men
was
in
its
finest
bloom
when
we
young
folks
began
also
to
bestir
ourselves
in
our
own
circle
and
with
my
younger
friends
if
not
with
older
persons
too
i
was
pretty
much
in
the
way
of
falling
into
this
sort
of
mutual
flattery
forbearance
raising
and
supporting
in
my
immediate
sphere
whatever
i
produced
could
always
be
reckoned
good
ladies
friends
and
patrons
will
not
consider
bad
that
which
is
undertaken
and
written
out
of
affection
for
them
from
such
obligations
at
last
arises
the
expression
of
an
empty
satisfaction
with
each
other
in
the
phrases
of
which
a
character
is
easily
lost
if
it
is
not
from
time
to
time
steeled
to
higher
excellence
and
thus
i
had
the
happiness
to
say
that
by
means
of
an
unexpected
acquaintance
all
the
love
of
the
vanity
pride
and
haughtiness
that
might
have
been
resting
or
working
within
me
were
exposed
to
a
very
severe
trial
which
was
unique
in
its
kind
by
no
means
in
accordance
with
the
time
and
therefore
so
much
the
more
searching
and
more
sorely
felt
herder
for
the
most
important
event
one
that
was
to
have
the
weightiest
consequences
for
me
was
my
acquaintance
with
herder
and
the
nearer
connexion
with
him
which
sprung
from
it
he
accompanied
the
travels
of
the
prince
of
who
was
in
a
melancholy
state
of
mind
and
had
come
with
him
to
strasburg
our
society
as
soon
as
it
knew
of
his
arrival
was
seized
with
a
great
longing
to
approach
him
and
this
good
fortune
happened
to
me
first
quite
unexpectedly
and
by
chance
i
had
gone
to
the
ghost
tavern
to
inquire
after
some
distinguished
stranger
or
other
just
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
i
found
a
man
who
was
on
the
point
of
ascending
and
whom
i
might
have
taken
for
a
clergyman
his
powdered
hair
was
put
up
in
a
queue
his
black
clothes
likewise
distinguished
him
but
still
more
a
long
black
silk
mantle
the
skirts
of
which
he
had
gathered
up
and
stuck
into
his
pocket
this
somewhat
striking
but
yet
on
the
whole
polite
and
pleasing
figure
of
which
i
had
already
been
told
left
me
not
the
least
doubt
that
he
was
the
celebrated
newcomer
and
my
address
was
to
convince
him
at
once
that
i
knew
him
he
asked
my
name
which
could
be
of
no
consequence
to
him
but
my
frankness
seemed
to
please
him
since
he
returned
it
with
great
friendliness
and
as
we
mounted
the
stairs
showed
himself
ready
immediately
for
animated
communication
i
have
forgotten
whom
we
visited
then
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
at
parting
i
begged
permission
to
wait
on
him
at
his
own
residence
which
he
granted
me
kindly
enough
i
did
not
neglect
to
avail
myself
repeatedly
of
this
favour
and
was
more
and
more
attracted
by
him
he
had
somewhat
of
softness
in
his
manner
which
was
very
suitable
and
becoming
without
being
exactly
easy
a
round
face
an
imposing
forehead
a
somewhat
puggish
nose
a
mouth
somewhat
prominent
but
highly
characteristic
pleasing
and
amiable
a
pair
of
eyes
under
black
which
did
not
fail
of
their
effect
although
one
of
them
used
to
be
red
and
inflamed
by
various
questions
he
tried
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
me
and
my
situation
and
his
power
of
attraction
operated
on
me
with
growing
strength
i
was
generally
speaking
of
a
very
confiding
disposition
and
with
him
especially
i
had
no
secrets
it
was
not
long
however
before
the
repelling
pulse
of
his
nature
began
to
appear
and
placed
me
in
no
small
uneasiness
i
related
to
him
many
things
of
my
youthful
occupations
and
taste
and
among
others
of
a
collection
of
seals
which
i
had
principally
gotten
together
through
the
assistance
of
our
family
friend
who
had
an
extensive
correspondence
i
had
arranged
them
according
to
the
and
by
this
means
had
become
well
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
the
potentates
the
greater
and
lesser
mightinesses
and
powers
even
down
to
the
nobility
under
them
these
heraldic
insignia
had
often
and
in
particular
at
the
ceremonies
of
the
coronation
been
of
use
to
my
memory
i
spoke
of
these
things
with
some
complacency
but
he
was
of
another
opinion
and
not
only
stripped
the
subject
of
all
interest
but
also
contrived
to
make
it
ridiculous
and
nearly
disgusting
from
this
his
spirit
of
contradiction
i
had
much
to
endure
for
he
had
resolved
partly
because
he
wished
to
separate
from
the
prince
partly
on
account
of
a
complaint
in
his
eye
to
remain
in
strasburg
this
complaint
is
one
of
the
most
inconvenient
and
unpleasant
and
the
more
troublesome
since
it
can
be
cured
only
by
a
painful
highly
irritating
and
uncertain
operation
the
is
closed
below
so
that
the
moisture
contained
in
it
can
not
flow
off
to
the
nose
and
so
much
the
less
as
the
adjacent
bone
is
deficient
in
the
aperture
by
which
this
secretion
should
naturally
take
place
the
bottom
of
the
must
therefore
be
cut
open
and
the
bone
bored
through
when
a
is
drawn
through
the
lachrymal
point
then
down
through
the
opened
bag
and
the
new
canal
thus
put
into
connexion
with
it
and
this
hair
is
moved
backwards
and
forwards
every
day
in
order
to
restore
the
communication
between
the
two
parts
all
which
can
not
be
done
or
attained
if
an
incision
is
not
first
made
externally
in
that
place
herder
was
now
separated
from
the
prince
was
moved
into
lodgings
of
his
own
and
resolved
to
have
himself
operated
upon
by
lobstein
here
those
exercises
by
which
i
had
sought
to
blunt
my
sensibility
did
me
good
service
i
was
able
to
be
present
at
the
operation
and
to
be
serviceable
and
helpful
in
many
ways
to
so
worthy
a
man
i
found
here
every
reason
to
admire
his
great
firmness
and
endurance
for
neither
during
the
numerous
surgical
operations
nor
at
the
painful
dressings
did
he
show
himself
in
any
degree
irritable
and
of
all
of
us
he
seemed
to
be
the
one
who
suffered
least
but
in
the
intervals
indeed
we
had
to
endure
the
changes
of
his
temper
in
many
ways
i
say
for
besides
myself
a
pleasant
russian
named
peglow
was
mostly
with
him
this
man
had
been
an
early
acquaintance
of
herder
in
riga
and
though
no
longer
a
youth
was
trying
to
perfect
himself
in
surgery
under
lobstein
guidance
herder
could
be
charmingly
prepossessing
and
brilliant
but
he
could
just
as
easily
turn
an
side
foremost
all
men
indeed
have
this
attraction
and
repulsion
according
to
their
nature
some
more
some
less
some
in
longer
some
in
shorter
pulsations
few
can
really
control
their
peculiarities
in
this
respect
many
in
appearance
as
for
herder
the
preponderance
of
his
contradictory
bitter
biting
humour
was
certainly
derived
from
his
disease
and
the
sufferings
arising
from
it
this
case
often
occurs
in
life
one
does
not
sufficiently
take
into
consideration
the
moral
effect
of
sickly
conditions
and
one
therefore
judges
many
characters
very
unjustly
because
it
is
assumed
that
all
men
are
healthy
and
required
of
them
that
they
shall
conduct
themselves
accordingly
herder
during
the
whole
time
of
this
cure
i
visited
herder
morning
and
evening
i
even
remained
whole
days
with
him
and
in
a
short
time
accustomed
myself
so
much
the
more
to
his
chiding
and
as
i
daily
learned
to
appreciate
his
beautiful
and
great
qualities
his
extensive
knowledge
and
his
profound
views
the
influence
of
this
blusterer
was
great
and
important
he
was
five
years
older
than
myself
which
in
younger
days
makes
a
great
difference
to
begin
with
and
as
i
acknowledged
him
for
what
he
was
and
tried
to
value
that
which
he
had
already
produced
he
necessarily
gained
a
great
superiority
over
me
but
the
situation
was
not
comfortable
for
older
persons
with
whom
i
had
associated
hitherto
had
sought
to
form
me
with
indulgence
perhaps
had
even
spoiled
me
by
their
lenity
but
from
herder
behave
as
one
might
one
could
never
expect
approval
as
now
on
the
one
side
my
great
affection
and
reverence
for
him
and
on
the
other
the
discontent
which
he
excited
in
me
were
continually
at
strife
with
each
other
there
arose
within
me
an
inward
struggle
the
first
of
its
kind
which
i
had
experienced
in
my
life
since
his
conversations
were
at
all
times
important
whether
he
asked
answered
or
communicated
his
opinions
in
any
other
manner
he
could
not
but
advance
me
daily
nay
hourly
to
new
views
at
leipzig
i
had
accustomed
myself
to
a
narrow
and
circumscribed
existence
and
my
general
knowledge
of
german
literature
could
not
be
extended
by
my
situation
in
frankfort
nay
those
occupations
had
led
me
into
obscure
regions
and
what
had
been
passing
for
some
years
back
in
the
wide
literary
world
had
for
the
most
part
remained
unknown
to
me
now
i
was
at
once
made
acquainted
by
herder
with
all
the
new
aspiration
and
all
the
tendencies
which
it
seemed
to
be
taking
he
had
already
made
himself
sufficiently
known
and
by
his
his
and
other
works
had
immediately
placed
himself
by
the
side
of
the
most
eminent
men
who
had
for
a
long
time
drawn
towards
them
the
eyes
of
their
country
what
an
agitation
there
must
have
been
in
such
a
mind
what
a
fermentation
there
must
have
been
in
such
a
nature
can
neither
be
conceived
nor
described
but
great
was
certainly
the
concealed
effort
as
will
be
easily
admitted
when
one
reflects
for
how
many
years
afterwards
and
how
much
he
has
done
and
produced
we
had
not
lived
together
long
in
this
manner
when
he
confided
to
me
that
he
meant
to
be
a
competitor
for
the
prize
which
was
offered
at
berlin
for
the
best
treatise
on
the
origin
of
language
his
work
was
already
nearly
completed
and
as
he
wrote
a
very
neat
hand
he
could
soon
communicate
to
me
in
parts
a
legible
manuscript
i
had
never
reflected
on
such
subjects
for
i
was
yet
too
deeply
involved
in
the
midst
of
things
to
have
thought
about
their
beginning
and
end
the
question
too
seemed
to
me
in
some
measure
an
idle
one
for
if
god
had
created
man
as
man
language
was
just
as
innate
in
him
as
walking
erect
he
must
have
just
as
well
perceived
that
he
could
sing
with
his
throat
and
modify
the
tones
in
various
ways
with
tongue
palate
and
lips
as
he
must
have
remarked
that
he
could
walk
and
take
hold
of
things
if
man
was
of
divine
origin
so
was
also
language
itself
and
if
man
considered
in
the
circle
of
nature
was
a
natural
being
language
was
likewise
natural
these
two
things
like
soul
and
body
i
could
never
separate
süssmilch
with
a
realism
crude
yet
somewhat
fantastically
devised
had
declared
himself
for
the
divine
origin
that
is
that
god
had
played
the
schoolmaster
to
the
first
men
treatise
went
to
show
that
man
as
man
could
and
must
have
attained
to
language
by
his
own
powers
i
read
the
treatise
with
much
pleasure
and
it
was
of
special
aid
in
strengthening
my
mind
only
i
did
not
stand
high
enough
either
in
knowledge
or
thought
to
form
a
solid
judgment
upon
it
i
therefore
gave
the
author
my
applause
adding
only
a
few
remarks
which
flowed
from
my
way
of
viewing
the
subject
but
one
was
received
just
like
the
other
there
was
scolding
and
blaming
whether
one
agreed
with
him
conditionally
or
unconditionally
the
fat
surgeon
had
less
patience
than
i
he
humorously
declined
the
communication
of
this
and
affirmed
that
he
was
not
prepared
to
meditate
on
such
abstract
topics
he
urged
us
in
preference
to
a
game
of
ombre
which
we
commonly
played
together
in
the
evening
herder
sarcasms
during
so
troublesome
and
painful
a
cure
herder
lost
nothing
of
his
vivacity
but
it
became
less
and
less
amiable
he
could
not
write
a
note
to
ask
for
anything
that
would
not
be
spiced
with
some
scoff
or
other
once
for
instance
he
wrote
to
me
thus
if
those
letters
of
brutus
thou
hast
in
thy
cicero
letters
thou
whom
consolers
of
schools
deck
out
in
magnificent
bindings
soothe
from
their
well
plan
shelves
yet
more
by
the
outside
than
inside
thou
who
from
gods
art
descended
or
goths
or
from
origin
filthy
goethe
send
them
to
me
it
was
not
polite
indeed
that
he
should
allow
himself
this
jest
on
my
name
for
a
man
name
is
not
like
a
mantle
which
merely
hangs
about
him
and
which
perchance
may
be
safely
twitched
and
pulled
but
is
a
perfectly
fitting
garment
which
has
grown
over
and
over
him
like
his
very
skin
at
which
one
can
not
scratch
and
scrape
without
wounding
the
man
himself
the
first
reproach
on
the
contrary
was
better
founded
i
had
brought
with
me
to
strasburg
the
authors
i
had
obtained
by
exchange
from
langer
with
various
fine
editions
from
my
father
collection
besides
and
had
set
them
up
on
a
neat
with
the
best
intentions
of
using
them
but
how
should
my
time
which
i
split
up
into
an
hundred
different
activities
suffice
for
that
herder
who
was
most
attentive
to
books
since
he
had
need
of
them
every
moment
perceived
my
fine
collection
at
his
first
visit
but
soon
saw
too
that
i
made
no
use
of
them
he
therefore
as
the
greatest
enemy
to
all
false
appearances
and
ostentation
was
accustomed
on
occasion
to
rally
me
upon
the
subject
another
sarcastic
poem
occurs
to
me
which
he
sent
me
one
evening
when
i
had
been
telling
him
a
great
deal
about
the
dresden
gallery
i
had
indeed
not
penetrated
into
the
higher
meaning
of
the
italian
school
but
dominico
feti
an
excellent
artist
although
a
humorist
and
therefore
not
of
the
first
rank
had
interested
me
much
scripture
subjects
had
to
be
painted
he
confined
himself
to
the
new
testament
parables
and
was
fond
of
representing
them
with
much
originality
taste
and
he
brought
them
altogether
into
life
and
the
spirited
and
details
of
his
compositions
recommended
by
a
free
pencil
had
made
a
vivid
impression
upon
me
at
this
my
childish
enthusiasm
for
art
herder
sneered
in
the
following
fashion
from
sympathy
the
master
i
like
best
of
all
dominico
feti
they
call
a
parable
from
scripture
he
is
able
neatly
to
turn
into
a
crazy
fable
from
sympathy
thou
crazy
parable
i
could
mention
many
jokes
of
the
kind
more
or
less
clear
or
abstruse
cheerful
or
bitter
they
did
not
vex
me
but
made
me
feel
uncomfortable
yet
since
i
knew
how
to
value
highly
everything
that
contributed
to
my
own
cultivation
and
as
i
had
often
given
up
former
opinions
and
inclinations
i
soon
accommodated
myself
and
only
sought
as
far
as
it
was
possible
for
me
from
my
point
of
view
to
distinguish
just
blame
from
unjust
invectives
and
thus
no
day
passed
over
that
had
not
been
in
the
most
fruitful
manner
instructive
to
me
i
was
made
acquainted
by
him
with
poetry
from
quite
a
different
side
in
another
light
than
heretofore
and
one
too
which
suited
me
well
the
poetic
art
of
the
hebrews
which
he
treated
ingeniously
after
his
predecessor
lowth
popular
poetry
the
traditions
of
which
in
alsace
he
urged
us
to
search
after
and
the
oldest
records
existing
as
poetry
all
bore
witness
that
poetry
in
general
was
a
gift
to
the
world
and
to
nations
and
not
the
private
inheritance
of
a
few
refined
cultivated
men
i
swallowed
all
this
and
the
more
eager
i
was
in
receiving
the
more
liberal
was
he
in
giving
so
that
we
spent
the
most
interesting
hours
together
the
other
natural
studies
which
i
had
begun
i
endeavoured
to
continue
and
as
one
always
has
time
enough
if
one
will
apply
it
well
so
amongst
them
all
i
succeeded
in
doing
twice
or
thrice
as
much
as
usual
as
to
the
fulness
of
those
few
weeks
during
which
we
lived
together
i
can
well
say
that
all
which
herder
has
gradually
produced
since
was
then
announced
in
the
germ
and
that
i
thereby
fell
into
the
fortunate
condition
that
i
could
completely
attach
to
something
higher
and
expand
all
that
i
had
hitherto
thought
learned
and
made
my
own
had
herder
been
methodical
i
should
have
found
the
most
precious
guide
for
giving
a
durable
tendency
to
my
cultivation
but
he
was
more
inclined
to
examine
and
stimulate
than
to
lead
and
conduct
thus
he
at
first
made
me
acquainted
with
hamann
writings
upon
which
he
set
a
very
great
value
but
instead
of
instructing
me
as
to
these
and
making
the
bias
and
drift
of
his
extraordinary
mind
intelligible
to
me
it
generally
only
served
him
for
amusement
when
i
behaved
strangely
enough
in
trying
to
get
at
the
meaning
of
such
sibylline
leaves
however
i
could
well
feel
that
something
in
hamann
writings
appealed
to
me
and
to
this
i
gave
myself
up
without
knowing
whence
it
came
or
whither
it
was
leading
me
herder
departure
after
the
cure
had
lasted
longer
than
was
reasonable
lobstein
had
begun
to
hesitate
and
to
repeat
himself
in
his
treatment
so
that
the
affair
would
not
come
to
an
end
and
peglow
too
had
confided
to
me
in
private
that
a
favourable
issue
was
hardly
to
be
expected
the
whole
position
became
gloomy
herder
became
impatient
and
out
of
temper
he
could
not
succeed
in
continuing
his
activity
as
heretofore
and
was
obliged
to
restrain
himself
the
more
as
they
began
to
lay
the
blame
of
the
surgical
failure
upon
his
too
great
mental
exertion
and
his
uninterrupted
animated
nay
merry
intercourse
with
us
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
after
so
much
trouble
and
suffering
the
artificial
would
not
form
itself
and
the
communication
intended
would
not
take
place
it
was
necessary
to
let
the
wound
heal
over
in
order
that
the
disease
should
not
become
worse
if
now
during
the
operation
one
could
but
admire
herder
firmness
under
such
pains
his
melancholy
and
even
fierce
resignation
to
the
idea
that
he
must
bear
such
a
blot
about
him
all
his
life
had
about
it
something
truly
sublime
by
which
he
gained
for
ever
the
reverence
of
those
who
saw
and
loved
him
this
disease
which
disfigured
so
expressive
a
countenance
must
have
been
so
much
the
more
afflicting
to
him
as
he
had
become
acquainted
with
an
excellent
lady
in
darmstadt
and
had
gained
her
affections
it
may
have
been
for
this
cause
principally
that
he
submitted
to
the
cure
in
order
on
his
return
to
appear
more
free
more
cheerful
and
more
handsome
in
the
eyes
of
his
and
to
unite
himself
more
certainly
and
indissolubly
with
her
however
he
hastened
away
from
strasburg
as
soon
as
possible
and
since
his
stay
had
hitherto
been
as
expensive
as
it
was
unpleasant
i
borrowed
a
sum
of
money
for
him
which
he
promised
to
refund
by
an
appointed
day
the
time
passed
without
the
arrival
of
the
money
my
creditor
indeed
did
not
dun
me
but
i
was
for
several
weeks
in
embarrassment
at
last
the
letter
and
the
money
came
and
even
here
he
did
not
act
unlike
himself
for
instead
of
thanks
or
an
apology
his
letter
contained
nothing
but
satirical
things
in
doggerel
verse
which
would
have
puzzled
if
not
alienated
another
but
it
did
not
move
me
at
all
for
i
had
conceived
so
great
and
powerful
an
idea
of
his
worth
that
it
absorbed
everything
of
an
opposite
nature
which
could
have
injured
it
one
should
never
speak
publicly
at
least
of
one
own
faults
or
those
of
others
if
one
does
not
hope
to
effect
some
useful
purpose
by
it
on
this
account
i
will
here
insert
certain
remarks
which
force
themselves
upon
me
gratitude
and
ingratitude
belong
to
those
events
which
appear
every
moment
in
the
moral
world
and
about
which
men
can
never
agree
among
themselves
i
usually
distinguish
between
ingratitude
and
aversion
from
gratitude
the
first
is
innate
with
men
nay
created
with
them
for
it
arises
from
a
happy
volatile
forgetfulness
of
the
repulsive
as
well
as
of
the
delightful
by
which
alone
the
continuation
of
life
is
possible
man
needs
such
an
infinite
quantity
of
previous
and
concurrent
assistances
for
a
tolerable
existence
that
if
he
would
always
pay
to
the
sun
and
the
earth
to
god
and
nature
to
ancestors
and
parents
to
friends
and
companions
the
thanks
due
to
them
he
would
have
neither
time
nor
feeling
left
to
receive
and
enjoy
new
benefits
but
if
the
natural
man
suffers
this
volatility
to
get
the
control
in
and
over
him
a
cold
indifference
gains
more
and
more
the
ascendancy
and
one
at
last
regards
benefactor
as
a
stranger
to
whose
injury
perhaps
anything
may
be
undertaken
provided
it
be
advantageous
to
ourselves
this
alone
can
properly
be
called
ingratitude
which
results
from
the
rudeness
into
which
the
uncultivated
nature
must
necessarily
lose
itself
at
last
aversion
from
gratitude
however
the
rewarding
of
a
benefit
by
and
sullen
conduct
is
very
rare
and
occurs
only
in
eminent
men
such
as
with
great
natural
gifts
and
a
presentiment
of
them
being
born
in
a
lower
rank
of
society
or
in
a
helpless
condition
must
from
their
youth
upwards
force
themselves
along
step
by
step
and
receive
at
every
point
aids
and
supports
which
are
often
embittered
and
repulsive
to
them
through
the
coarseness
of
their
benefactors
since
that
which
they
receive
is
earthly
while
that
which
on
the
other
hand
they
give
is
of
a
higher
kind
so
that
what
is
strictly
speaking
a
compensation
is
out
of
the
question
lessing
with
the
fine
knowledge
of
earthly
things
which
fell
to
his
share
in
the
best
years
of
his
life
has
in
one
place
bluntly
but
cheerfully
expressed
himself
herder
on
the
contrary
constantly
embittered
his
finest
days
both
for
himself
and
others
because
he
knew
not
how
to
moderate
by
strength
of
mind
in
later
years
that
which
had
necessarily
seized
him
in
youth
artificial
gratitude
one
may
well
make
this
demand
of
oneself
for
to
a
man
capability
of
cultivation
comes
with
friendly
aid
the
light
of
nature
which
is
always
active
in
enlightening
him
about
his
condition
and
generally
in
many
moral
points
of
culture
one
should
not
construe
the
failings
too
severely
nor
look
about
after
the
most
serious
and
remote
means
of
correcting
them
for
certain
faults
may
be
easily
and
even
playfully
removed
thus
for
instance
by
mere
habit
we
can
excite
gratitude
in
ourselves
keep
it
alive
and
even
make
it
necessary
to
us
in
a
biographical
attempt
it
is
proper
to
speak
of
oneself
i
am
by
nature
as
little
grateful
as
any
man
and
on
forgetting
the
benefit
received
the
violent
feeling
of
a
momentary
disagreement
could
very
easily
beguile
me
into
ingratitude
to
obviate
this
i
accustomed
myself
in
the
first
place
with
everything
that
i
possessed
to
call
to
mind
with
pleasure
how
i
came
by
it
from
whom
i
received
it
whether
it
was
by
way
of
present
exchange
or
purchase
or
in
any
other
manner
i
have
accustomed
myself
in
showing
my
collections
to
mention
the
persons
by
whose
means
i
obtained
each
article
nay
even
to
do
justice
to
the
occasion
to
the
accident
to
the
remotest
cause
and
coincidence
by
which
things
which
are
dear
and
of
value
to
me
have
become
mine
that
which
surrounds
us
thus
receives
a
life
we
see
in
it
a
spiritual
combination
full
of
love
reminding
us
of
its
origin
and
by
thus
making
past
circumstances
present
to
us
our
momentary
existence
is
elevated
and
enriched
the
originators
of
the
gifts
rise
repeatedly
before
the
imagination
we
connect
with
their
image
a
pleasing
remembrance
ingratitude
becomes
impossible
and
a
return
on
occasion
becomes
easy
and
desirable
at
the
same
time
we
are
led
to
the
consideration
of
that
which
is
not
a
possession
palpable
to
the
senses
and
we
love
to
recapitulate
to
whom
our
higher
endowments
are
to
be
ascribed
and
whence
they
take
their
date
before
i
turn
my
attention
from
that
connexion
with
herder
which
was
so
important
and
so
rich
in
consequences
for
me
i
find
yet
something
more
to
adduce
nothing
was
more
natural
than
that
i
should
by
degrees
become
more
and
more
reserved
towards
herder
in
communicating
those
things
which
had
hitherto
contributed
to
my
culture
but
especially
such
as
still
seriously
occupied
my
attention
at
the
moment
he
had
destroyed
my
enjoyment
of
so
much
that
i
had
loved
before
and
had
especially
blamed
me
in
the
strongest
manner
for
the
pleasure
i
took
in
i
might
defend
my
favourite
as
i
would
i
might
say
that
for
a
youthful
fancy
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
than
to
linger
in
those
cheerful
and
glorious
regions
with
gods
and
and
to
be
a
witness
of
their
deeds
and
passions
i
might
circumstantially
quote
that
previously
mentioned
opinion
of
a
man
and
corroborate
it
by
my
own
experience
all
this
according
to
herder
went
for
nothing
there
was
no
immediate
truth
properly
so
called
to
be
found
in
these
poems
here
was
neither
greece
nor
italy
neither
a
primitive
world
nor
a
cultivated
one
everything
was
rather
an
imitation
of
what
had
already
existed
and
a
mannerised
representation
such
as
could
be
expected
only
from
an
man
and
if
at
last
i
would
maintain
that
whatever
an
eminent
individual
produces
is
also
nature
and
that
always
in
all
nations
ancient
and
modern
the
poet
alone
has
been
the
maker
this
was
not
allowed
to
pass
and
i
had
to
endure
much
on
this
account
nay
i
was
almost
disgusted
with
my
ovid
by
it
for
there
is
no
affection
no
habit
so
strong
that
it
can
hold
out
in
the
long
run
against
the
animadversions
of
eminent
men
in
whom
one
places
confidence
something
always
cleaves
to
us
and
if
one
can
not
love
unconditionally
love
is
already
in
a
critical
condition
i
most
carefully
concealed
from
him
my
interest
in
certain
subjects
which
had
rooted
themselves
within
me
and
were
by
little
and
little
moulding
themselves
into
poetic
form
these
were
von
and
the
biography
of
the
former
had
seized
my
inmost
heart
the
figure
of
a
rude
in
a
wild
anarchical
time
awakened
my
deepest
sympathy
the
significant
fable
of
the
latter
resounded
and
vibrated
within
me
i
had
also
wandered
about
in
all
sorts
of
science
and
had
early
enough
been
led
to
see
its
vanity
i
had
moreover
tried
all
sorts
of
ways
in
real
life
and
had
always
returned
more
unsatisfied
and
troubled
now
these
things
as
well
as
many
others
i
carried
about
with
me
and
delighted
myself
with
them
during
my
solitary
hours
but
without
writing
anything
down
but
most
of
all
i
concealed
from
herder
my
chemistry
and
everything
relating
to
it
although
at
the
same
time
i
was
still
very
fond
of
secretly
busying
myself
in
working
it
out
more
consistently
than
it
had
been
communicated
to
me
of
my
poetical
labours
i
believe
i
laid
before
him
but
i
do
not
recollect
that
on
this
account
i
received
either
correction
or
encouragement
on
his
part
yet
with
all
this
he
remained
what
he
was
whatever
proceeded
from
him
had
an
important
if
not
a
cheering
effect
and
even
his
handwriting
exercised
a
magic
power
over
me
i
do
not
remember
having
ever
torn
up
or
thrown
away
one
of
his
letters
or
even
a
mere
envelope
from
his
hand
yet
with
my
various
changes
of
place
and
time
not
one
document
of
those
strange
foreboding
and
happy
days
is
left
herder
influence
on
jung
that
herder
power
of
attraction
operated
upon
others
as
well
as
upon
me
i
should
scarcely
mention
had
i
not
to
remark
that
it
extended
itself
particularly
to
jung
commonly
called
stilling
the
true
honest
striving
of
this
man
could
not
but
deeply
interest
everybody
who
had
any
feeling
and
his
susceptibility
must
have
charmed
into
candour
every
one
who
was
in
a
condition
to
impart
anything
even
herder
behaved
towards
him
with
more
forbearance
than
towards
the
rest
of
us
for
his
always
seemed
to
stand
in
relation
with
the
action
exerted
upon
him
jung
narrowness
was
accompanied
by
so
much
his
urgency
with
so
much
softness
and
earnestness
that
a
man
of
intelligence
could
certainly
not
be
severe
against
him
and
a
benevolent
man
could
not
scoff
at
him
or
turn
him
into
ridicule
jung
was
also
exhilarated
to
such
a
degree
by
herder
that
he
felt
himself
strengthened
and
advanced
in
all
he
did
even
his
affection
for
me
seemed
to
lose
ground
in
the
same
ratio
yet
we
always
remained
good
companions
made
allowances
for
each
other
from
first
to
last
and
mutually
rendered
the
most
friendly
services
let
us
now
however
withdraw
ourselves
from
the
sick
chamber
of
friendship
and
from
the
general
considerations
which
refer
rather
to
disorder
than
to
health
of
mind
let
us
betake
ourselves
into
the
open
air
to
the
lofty
and
broad
gallery
of
the
minster
as
if
the
time
were
still
present
when
we
young
fellows
often
appointed
an
evening
meeting
to
greet
the
departing
sun
with
brimming
goblets
here
all
conversation
was
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
the
country
here
sharpness
of
was
put
to
the
proof
and
every
one
strove
to
perceive
nay
plainly
to
distinguish
the
most
distant
objects
good
telescopes
were
employed
to
assist
us
and
one
friend
after
another
exactly
pointed
out
the
spot
which
had
become
the
most
dear
and
precious
to
him
and
i
also
did
not
lack
such
a
little
spot
which
although
it
did
not
come
out
with
importance
in
the
landscape
nevertheless
more
than
all
the
rest
attracted
me
with
an
amiable
magic
on
these
occasions
the
imagination
was
excited
by
relating
our
adventures
and
several
little
jaunts
were
concerted
nay
often
undertaken
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
of
which
i
will
circumstantially
relate
only
one
instead
of
a
number
since
in
many
respects
it
was
of
consequence
to
me
with
two
worthy
friends
and
engelbach
and
weyland
both
natives
of
lower
alsace
i
repaired
on
horseback
to
zabern
where
in
the
fine
weather
the
friendly
little
place
smiled
pleasantly
upon
us
the
sight
of
the
bishop
castle
awakened
our
admiration
the
extent
height
and
splendour
of
a
new
set
of
stables
bore
witness
to
the
other
comforts
of
the
owner
the
gorgeousness
of
the
staircase
surprised
us
the
chambers
and
saloons
we
trode
with
reverence
only
the
person
of
the
cardinal
a
little
wreck
of
a
man
whom
we
saw
at
table
made
a
contrast
the
view
of
the
garden
is
splendid
and
a
canal
three
quarters
of
a
league
long
which
leads
straight
up
to
the
middle
of
the
castle
gives
a
high
idea
of
the
taste
and
resources
of
the
former
possessors
we
rambled
up
and
down
there
and
enjoyed
many
parts
of
this
beautifully
situated
whole
which
lies
on
the
outskirts
of
the
magnificent
plain
of
alsace
at
the
foot
of
the
vosges
after
we
had
enjoyed
ourselves
at
this
clerical
outpost
of
a
royal
power
and
had
made
ourselves
comfortable
in
its
region
we
arrived
early
next
morning
at
a
public
work
which
most
nobly
opens
the
entrance
into
a
mighty
kingdom
illumined
by
the
beams
of
the
rising
sun
the
famous
a
work
of
incredible
labour
rose
before
us
a
road
built
over
the
most
fearful
crags
and
wide
enough
for
three
wagons
abreast
leads
up
hill
so
gently
that
the
ascent
is
scarcely
perceptible
the
hardness
and
smoothness
of
the
way
the
elevations
on
both
sides
for
the
the
stone
channels
to
lead
off
the
all
are
executed
as
neatly
as
artistically
and
durably
so
that
they
afford
a
satisfactory
view
thus
one
gradually
arrives
at
pfalzburg
a
modern
fortification
it
lies
upon
a
moderate
hill
the
works
are
elegantly
built
on
blackish
rocks
and
of
the
same
kind
of
stone
and
the
joinings
being
pointed
out
with
white
mortar
show
exactly
the
size
of
the
square
stones
and
give
a
striking
proof
of
neat
workmanship
we
found
the
place
itself
as
is
proper
for
a
fortress
regular
built
of
stone
and
the
church
in
good
taste
when
we
wandered
through
the
streets
it
was
nine
on
sunday
morning
we
heard
music
they
were
already
waltzing
in
the
tavern
to
their
hearts
content
and
as
the
inhabitants
did
not
suffer
themselves
to
be
disturbed
in
their
pleasures
by
the
great
scarcity
nay
by
the
threatened
famine
so
also
our
youthful
cheerfulness
was
not
at
all
troubled
when
the
baker
on
the
road
refused
us
some
bread
and
directed
us
to
the
tavern
where
perhaps
we
might
procure
provisions
at
the
usual
place
we
now
very
willingly
rode
down
the
again
to
gaze
at
this
architectural
wonder
a
second
time
and
to
enjoy
once
more
the
refreshing
prospect
over
alsace
we
soon
reached
buchsweiler
where
friend
weyland
had
prepared
for
us
a
good
reception
to
a
fresh
youthful
mind
the
condition
of
a
small
town
is
well
suited
family
connexions
are
closer
and
more
perceptible
domestic
life
which
with
moderate
activity
moves
hither
and
thither
between
light
official
duties
town
business
agriculture
and
gardening
invites
us
to
a
friendly
participation
sociableness
is
necessary
and
the
stranger
finds
himself
very
pleasantly
situated
in
the
limited
circles
if
the
disputes
of
the
inhabitants
which
in
such
places
are
more
palpable
do
not
everywhere
come
in
contact
with
him
this
little
town
was
the
chief
place
of
the
county
of
belonging
to
the
landgrave
of
darmstadt
under
french
sovereignty
a
regency
and
board
of
officers
established
here
made
the
place
an
important
of
a
very
beautiful
and
desirable
principality
we
easily
forgot
the
unequal
streets
and
the
irregular
architecture
of
the
place
when
we
went
out
to
look
at
the
old
castle
and
the
gardens
which
are
excellently
laid
out
on
a
hill
numerous
little
a
preserve
for
tame
and
wild
pheasants
and
the
relics
of
many
similar
arrangements
showed
how
pleasant
this
little
residence
must
formerly
have
been
yet
all
these
views
were
surpassed
by
the
prospect
which
met
the
eye
when
from
the
neighbouring
baschberg
one
looked
over
the
perfectly
paradisiacal
region
this
height
wholly
heaped
together
out
of
different
kinds
of
shells
attracted
my
attention
for
the
first
time
to
such
documents
of
antiquity
i
had
never
before
seen
them
together
in
so
great
a
mass
yet
the
curious
eye
soon
turned
itself
exclusively
to
the
landscape
you
stand
on
the
last
landward
towards
the
north
lies
a
fruitful
plain
interspersed
with
little
forests
and
bounded
by
a
stem
low
of
mountains
that
stretches
itself
westward
towards
zaber
where
the
episcopal
palace
and
the
abbey
of
john
lying
a
league
beyond
it
may
be
plainly
recognised
thence
the
eye
follows
the
more
and
more
vanishing
chain
of
the
vosges
towards
the
south
if
you
turn
to
the
you
see
the
castle
of
lichtenberg
upon
a
rock
and
towards
the
the
eye
has
the
boundless
plain
of
alsace
to
scrutinize
which
afar
off
withdraws
itself
from
the
sight
in
the
more
and
more
misty
landscape
until
at
last
the
suabian
mountains
melt
away
like
shadows
into
the
horizon
already
in
my
limited
wanderings
through
the
world
i
had
remarked
how
important
it
is
in
travelling
to
inquire
after
the
course
of
the
waters
and
even
to
ask
with
respect
to
the
smallest
brook
whither
in
reality
it
runs
one
thus
acquires
a
general
survey
of
every
in
which
one
happens
to
be
a
conception
of
the
heights
and
depths
which
bear
relation
to
each
other
and
by
these
leading
things
which
assist
the
contemplation
as
well
as
the
memory
extricates
oneself
in
the
surest
manner
from
the
geological
and
political
labyrinth
with
these
observations
i
took
a
solemn
farewell
of
my
beloved
alsace
as
the
next
morning
we
meant
to
turn
our
steps
towards
lorraine
the
evening
passed
away
in
familiar
conversation
in
which
we
tried
to
cheer
ourselves
up
under
a
joyless
present
by
remembrances
of
a
better
past
here
as
in
the
whole
of
this
small
country
the
name
of
the
last
count
reinhard
von
hanau
was
blessed
above
all
others
his
great
understanding
and
aptitude
had
appeared
in
all
his
actions
and
many
a
beautiful
memorial
of
his
existence
yet
remained
such
men
have
the
advantage
of
being
double
benefactors
once
to
the
present
which
they
make
happy
and
then
to
the
future
the
feeling
of
which
and
courage
they
nourish
and
sustain
saarbrück
now
as
we
turned
ourselves
into
the
mountains
passed
by
lützelstein
an
old
mountain
tower
in
a
very
hilly
country
and
descended
into
the
region
of
the
saar
and
the
moselle
the
heavens
began
to
lower
as
if
they
would
render
yet
more
sensible
to
us
the
condition
of
the
more
rugged
western
country
the
valley
of
the
saar
where
we
first
found
bockenheim
a
small
place
and
saw
opposite
to
it
neusaarwerden
which
is
with
a
is
bordered
on
both
sides
by
mountains
which
might
be
called
melancholy
if
at
their
foot
an
endless
succession
of
meadows
and
fields
called
the
huhnau
did
not
extend
as
far
as
saaralbe
and
beyond
it
further
than
the
eye
can
reach
great
buildings
belonging
to
the
former
stables
of
the
duke
of
lorraine
here
attract
the
eye
they
are
at
present
used
as
a
dairy
for
which
purpose
indeed
they
are
very
well
situated
we
passed
through
saargemünd
to
saarbrück
and
this
little
residence
was
a
bright
point
in
a
land
so
rocky
and
woody
the
town
small
and
hilly
but
well
adorned
by
the
last
prince
makes
at
once
a
pleasing
impression
as
the
houses
are
all
painted
a
greyish
white
and
the
different
elevation
of
them
affords
a
variegated
view
in
the
middle
of
a
beautiful
square
surrounded
with
handsome
buildings
stands
the
lutheran
church
on
a
small
scale
but
in
proportion
with
the
whole
the
front
of
the
castle
lies
on
the
same
level
with
the
town
the
back
on
the
contrary
on
the
declivity
of
a
steep
rock
this
has
not
only
been
worked
out
to
afford
easy
access
to
the
valley
but
an
oblong
has
also
been
obtained
below
by
turning
off
the
stream
on
one
side
and
cutting
away
the
rock
on
the
other
after
which
this
whole
space
was
lastly
filled
up
with
earth
and
planted
the
time
of
this
undertaking
fell
in
the
epoch
when
they
used
to
consult
the
architects
about
laying
out
gardens
just
as
at
present
they
call
in
the
aid
of
the
eye
the
whole
arrangement
of
the
castle
the
costly
and
the
agreeable
the
rich
and
the
ornamental
betokened
a
owner
such
as
the
deceased
prince
had
been
the
present
sovereign
was
not
at
home
president
von
günderode
received
us
in
the
most
obliging
manner
and
entertained
us
for
three
days
better
than
we
had
a
right
to
expect
i
made
use
of
the
various
acquaintance
which
we
formed
to
instruct
myself
in
many
respects
the
life
of
the
former
prince
rich
in
pleasure
gave
material
enough
for
conversation
as
well
as
the
various
expedients
which
he
hit
upon
to
make
use
of
the
advantages
supplied
by
the
nature
of
his
land
here
i
was
now
properly
initiated
into
the
interest
for
mountain
countries
and
the
love
for
those
economical
and
technical
investigations
which
have
busied
me
a
great
part
of
my
life
was
first
awakened
within
me
we
heard
of
the
rich
at
dutweil
of
the
iron
and
alum
works
and
even
of
a
burning
mountain
and
we
prepared
ourselves
to
see
these
wonders
close
we
now
rode
through
woody
mountains
which
must
seem
wild
and
dreary
to
him
who
comes
out
of
a
magnificent
fertile
land
and
which
can
attract
us
only
by
the
internal
contents
of
its
bosom
we
were
made
acquainted
with
one
simple
and
one
complicated
piece
of
machinery
within
a
short
distance
of
each
other
namely
a
and
a
factory
if
one
is
pleased
at
the
first
because
it
supplies
the
place
of
common
hands
one
can
not
sufficiently
admire
the
other
for
it
works
in
a
higher
organic
sense
from
which
understanding
and
consciousness
are
scarcely
to
be
separated
in
the
we
made
accurate
inquiries
after
the
production
and
purifying
of
this
so
necessary
material
and
when
we
saw
great
heaps
of
a
white
greasy
loose
earthy
matter
and
asked
the
use
of
it
the
labourers
answered
smiling
that
it
was
the
scum
thrown
up
in
boiling
the
alum
and
that
herr
stauf
had
it
collected
as
he
hoped
perchance
to
turn
it
to
some
profit
is
herr
stauf
alive
yet
exclaimed
my
companion
in
surprise
they
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
assured
us
that
according
to
the
plan
of
our
journey
we
should
not
pass
far
from
his
lonely
dwelling
coal
and
our
road
now
led
up
along
the
channels
by
which
the
is
conducted
down
and
the
principal
horizontal
works
which
they
call
the
and
from
which
the
famous
dutweil
coals
are
procured
these
when
they
are
dry
have
the
blue
colour
of
darkly
tarnished
steel
and
the
most
beautiful
succession
of
rainbow
tints
plays
over
the
surface
with
every
movement
the
deep
abysses
of
the
however
attracted
us
so
much
the
less
as
their
contents
lay
richly
poured
out
around
us
we
now
reached
the
open
mine
in
which
the
roasted
are
steeped
in
lye
and
soon
after
a
strange
occurrence
surprised
us
although
we
had
been
prepared
we
entered
into
a
chasm
and
found
ourselves
in
the
region
of
the
burning
mountain
a
strong
smell
of
sulphur
surrounded
us
one
side
of
the
cavity
was
almost
covered
with
reddish
stone
burnt
white
thick
fumes
arose
from
the
crevices
and
we
felt
the
heat
of
the
ground
through
our
strong
an
event
so
accidental
for
it
is
not
known
how
this
place
became
ignited
affords
a
great
advantage
for
the
manufacture
of
alum
since
the
of
which
the
surface
of
the
mountain
consists
lie
there
perfectly
roasted
and
may
be
steeped
in
a
short
time
and
very
well
the
whole
chasm
had
arisen
by
the
calcined
scales
being
gradually
removed
and
used
up
we
clambered
up
out
of
this
depth
and
were
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
a
pleasant
encircled
the
spot
which
followed
up
to
the
chasm
and
extended
itself
on
both
sides
of
it
many
trees
stood
already
dried
up
some
were
withering
near
others
which
as
yet
quite
fresh
felt
no
forebodings
of
that
fierce
heat
which
was
approaching
and
threatening
their
roots
also
upon
this
space
different
openings
were
steaming
others
had
already
done
smoking
and
this
fire
had
thus
smouldered
for
ten
years
already
through
old
pits
and
horizontal
shafts
with
which
the
mountain
is
undermined
it
may
too
have
penetrated
to
the
clefts
through
new
for
some
hundred
paces
further
into
the
wood
they
had
contemplated
following
up
manifest
indications
of
an
abundance
of
coal
but
they
had
not
excavated
far
before
a
strong
smoke
burst
out
against
the
labourers
and
dispersed
them
the
opening
was
filled
up
again
yet
we
found
the
place
still
smoking
as
we
went
on
our
way
past
it
to
the
residence
of
our
chemist
this
lies
amid
mountains
and
woods
the
vallies
there
take
very
various
and
pleasing
windings
the
soil
round
about
is
black
and
of
the
coal
kind
and
strata
of
it
frequently
come
in
sight
a
coal
philosopher
per
as
they
said
formerly
could
scarcely
have
settled
himself
more
suitably
we
came
before
a
small
house
not
inconvenient
for
a
dwelling
and
found
herr
stauf
who
immediately
recognised
my
friend
and
received
him
with
lamentations
about
the
new
government
indeed
we
could
see
from
what
he
said
that
the
as
well
as
many
other
establishments
on
account
of
external
and
perhaps
internal
circumstances
also
did
not
pay
their
expenses
with
much
else
of
the
sort
he
belonged
to
the
chemists
of
that
time
who
with
a
hearty
feeling
for
all
that
could
be
done
with
the
products
of
nature
took
delight
in
abstruse
investigations
of
trifles
and
secondary
matters
and
with
their
insufficient
knowledge
were
not
dexterous
enough
to
do
that
from
which
properly
economical
and
mercantile
profit
is
to
be
derived
thus
the
use
which
he
promised
himself
from
that
scum
lay
very
far
in
the
distance
thus
he
had
nothing
to
show
but
a
cake
of
with
which
the
burning
mountain
had
supplied
him
and
glad
to
communicate
his
complaints
to
a
human
ear
the
lean
decrepit
little
man
with
a
shoe
on
one
foot
and
a
slipper
on
the
other
and
with
stockings
hanging
down
and
repeatedly
pulled
up
in
vain
dragged
himself
up
the
mountain
to
where
the
stands
which
he
himself
had
erected
and
now
with
great
grief
sees
falling
to
ruins
here
was
found
a
connected
row
of
furnaces
where
coal
was
to
be
cleansed
of
sulphur
and
made
fit
for
use
in
but
at
the
same
time
they
wished
also
to
turn
the
oil
and
resin
to
account
nay
they
would
not
even
lose
the
soot
and
thus
all
failed
together
on
account
of
the
many
ends
in
view
during
the
of
the
former
prince
the
business
had
been
carried
on
in
the
spirit
of
an
amateur
and
in
hope
now
they
asked
for
the
immediate
use
which
was
not
to
be
shown
after
we
left
our
adept
to
his
solitude
we
hastened
for
it
was
now
late
to
the
in
friedrichsthal
where
we
became
acquainted
on
our
way
with
one
of
the
most
important
and
most
wonderful
operations
of
human
ingenuity
nevertheless
some
pleasant
adventures
and
a
surprising
firework
at
net
far
from
neukirch
interested
us
young
fellows
almost
more
than
these
important
experiences
for
as
a
few
nights
before
on
the
banks
of
the
saar
shining
clouds
of
hovered
around
us
betwixt
rock
and
thicket
so
now
the
forges
played
their
sprightly
firework
towards
us
we
passed
in
the
depth
of
night
the
situated
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
and
were
delighted
with
the
strange
of
these
dens
of
plank
which
are
but
dimly
lighted
by
a
little
opening
in
the
glowing
furnace
the
noise
of
the
water
and
of
the
bellows
driven
by
it
the
fearful
whizzing
and
shrieking
of
the
blast
of
air
which
raging
into
the
smelted
ore
stuns
the
ears
and
confuses
the
senses
drove
us
away
at
last
to
turn
into
neukirch
which
is
built
up
against
the
mountain
but
notwithstanding
all
the
variety
and
fatigue
of
the
day
i
could
find
no
rest
here
i
left
my
friend
to
a
happy
sleep
and
sought
the
which
lay
still
further
up
it
looks
out
far
over
mountain
and
wood
the
outlines
of
which
were
only
to
be
recognised
against
the
clear
but
the
sides
and
depths
of
which
were
impenetrable
to
my
sight
this
building
stood
as
empty
as
it
was
lonely
no
castellan
no
huntsman
was
to
be
found
i
sat
before
the
great
glass
doors
upon
the
steps
which
run
around
the
whole
terrace
here
surrounded
by
mountains
over
a
dark
soil
which
seemed
yet
darker
in
contrast
with
the
clear
horizon
of
a
summer
night
with
the
glowing
starry
vault
above
me
i
sat
for
a
long
time
by
myself
on
the
deserted
spot
and
thought
i
never
had
felt
such
a
solitude
how
sweetly
then
was
i
surprised
by
the
distant
sound
of
a
couple
of
french
horns
which
at
once
like
the
fragrance
of
balsam
enlivened
the
peaceful
atmosphere
then
there
awakened
within
me
the
image
of
a
lovely
being
which
had
retired
into
the
background
before
the
motley
objects
of
these
travelling
days
but
which
now
unveiled
and
more
and
drove
me
from
the
spot
back
to
my
quarters
where
i
made
preparations
to
set
off
with
the
earliest
the
return
was
not
used
like
the
journey
out
thus
we
hurried
through
which
as
a
beautiful
and
notable
residence
might
well
have
deserved
our
attention
we
cast
a
glance
upon
the
great
simple
castle
on
the
extensive
esplanades
regularly
planted
with
and
very
well
adapted
for
the
training
of
and
on
the
large
stables
and
the
citizens
houses
which
the
prince
had
built
to
be
raffled
for
all
this
as
well
as
the
costume
and
manners
of
the
inhabitants
especially
of
the
matrons
and
maids
had
reference
to
a
distant
connexion
and
made
plainly
visible
the
relation
with
paris
from
which
for
a
long
time
nothing
transrhenane
had
been
able
to
withdraw
itself
we
visited
also
the
ducal
situated
before
the
city
which
are
extensive
and
furnished
with
large
tuns
we
went
on
further
and
at
last
found
the
country
like
that
in
the
neighbourhood
of
saarbrück
between
wild
and
savage
mountains
are
a
few
villages
one
here
gets
rid
of
the
habit
of
looking
about
for
corn
we
mounted
up
by
the
side
of
the
hornbach
to
bitsch
which
lies
on
the
important
spot
where
the
waters
divide
and
fall
a
part
into
the
saar
a
part
into
the
rhine
these
last
were
soon
to
attract
us
towards
them
yet
we
could
not
refuse
our
attention
to
the
little
city
of
bitsch
which
very
picturesquely
winds
around
the
mountain
nor
to
the
fortress
which
lies
above
this
is
partly
built
on
rocks
and
partly
hewn
out
of
them
the
subterraneous
chambers
are
particularly
worthy
of
remark
here
is
not
only
space
sufficient
for
the
abode
of
a
number
of
men
and
cattle
but
one
even
lights
upon
large
vaults
for
the
drilling
of
troops
a
mill
a
chapel
and
whatever
else
could
be
required
provided
the
surface
were
in
a
state
of
disturbance
we
now
followed
the
brooks
through
bärenthal
the
thick
forests
on
both
the
heights
remain
unused
by
the
hand
of
man
here
trunks
of
trees
lie
rotting
on
each
other
by
thousands
and
young
scions
sprout
up
without
number
from
their
progenitors
here
in
conversation
with
some
companions
on
foot
the
name
von
dieterich
again
struck
our
ears
which
we
had
often
heard
honourably
mentioned
already
in
these
woody
regions
the
activity
and
cleverness
of
this
man
his
wealth
and
the
use
and
applications
of
it
all
seemed
in
proportion
he
could
with
justice
take
delight
in
the
acquisitions
which
he
increased
and
enjoy
the
profits
he
secured
the
more
i
saw
of
the
world
the
more
pleasure
i
took
not
only
in
the
universally
famous
names
but
in
those
also
especially
which
were
mentioned
in
particular
regions
with
reverence
and
love
and
thus
i
easily
learned
here
by
a
few
questions
that
von
dieterich
earlier
than
others
had
known
how
to
make
successful
use
of
the
mountain
treasures
iron
coal
and
wood
and
had
worked
his
way
to
an
opulence
niederbrunn
where
we
now
arrived
was
a
new
proof
of
this
he
had
purchased
this
little
place
from
the
count
of
leiningen
and
other
to
erect
important
in
the
place
here
in
these
baths
already
founded
by
the
romans
floated
around
me
the
spirit
of
antiquity
venerable
relics
of
which
in
fragments
of
and
inscriptions
capitals
and
shafts
shone
out
strangely
towards
me
from
amidst
household
lumber
and
furniture
sesenheim
as
we
were
ascending
the
adjacent
wasenburg
also
i
paid
my
respects
to
a
inscription
which
discharged
a
thankful
vow
to
mercury
and
is
situated
upon
the
great
mass
of
rock
which
forms
the
base
of
the
hill
on
one
side
the
fortress
itself
lies
on
the
last
mountain
looking
from
bitsch
towards
germany
it
is
the
ruin
of
a
german
castle
built
upon
roman
remains
from
the
tower
the
whole
of
alsace
was
once
more
surveyed
and
the
conspicuous
pointed
out
the
situation
of
strasburg
first
of
all
however
the
great
forest
of
hagenau
extended
itself
and
the
towers
of
this
town
peered
plainly
from
behind
i
was
attracted
thither
we
rode
through
reichshof
where
von
dieterich
built
an
imposing
castle
and
after
we
had
contemplated
from
the
hills
near
niedermoder
the
pleasing
course
of
the
little
river
moder
by
the
forest
of
hagenau
i
left
my
friend
on
a
ridiculous
visitation
which
at
dutweil
might
have
been
a
somewhat
more
serious
business
and
i
then
rode
through
hagenau
on
the
direct
road
already
indicated
by
my
affection
to
my
beloved
sesenheim
for
all
these
views
into
a
wild
mountain
region
and
then
again
into
a
cheerful
fruitful
joyous
land
could
not
rivet
my
eye
which
was
directed
to
an
amiable
attractive
object
this
time
also
the
hither
way
seemed
to
me
more
charming
than
its
opposite
as
it
brought
me
again
into
the
neighbourhood
of
a
lady
to
whom
i
was
heartily
devoted
and
who
deserved
as
much
respect
as
love
but
before
i
lead
my
friends
to
her
rural
abode
let
me
be
permitted
to
mention
a
circumstance
which
contributed
very
much
to
enliven
and
enhance
my
affection
and
the
satisfaction
which
it
afforded
me
the
vicar
of
wakefield
how
far
i
must
have
been
behindhand
in
modern
literature
may
be
gathered
from
the
mode
of
life
which
i
led
at
frankfort
and
from
the
studies
to
which
i
had
devoted
myself
nor
could
my
residence
in
strasburg
have
furthered
me
in
this
respect
now
herder
came
and
together
with
his
great
knowledge
brought
many
other
aids
and
the
later
publications
besides
among
these
he
announced
to
us
the
of
as
an
excellent
work
with
the
german
translation
of
which
he
would
make
us
acquainted
by
reading
it
aloud
to
us
himself
his
method
of
reading
was
quite
peculiar
whoever
has
heard
him
preach
will
be
able
to
form
a
notion
of
it
he
delivered
everything
this
romance
included
in
a
serious
and
simple
style
perfectly
removed
from
all
dramatically
imitative
representation
he
even
avoided
that
variety
which
is
not
only
permitted
but
even
required
in
an
epical
delivery
a
slight
change
of
tone
when
different
persons
speak
by
which
what
every
one
says
is
brought
into
relief
and
the
actor
is
distinguished
from
the
narrator
without
being
monotonous
herder
let
everything
go
on
in
the
same
tone
just
as
if
nothing
was
present
before
him
but
all
was
merely
historical
as
if
the
shadows
of
this
poetic
creation
did
not
act
livingly
before
him
but
only
glided
gently
by
yet
this
manner
of
delivery
from
his
mouth
had
an
infinite
charm
for
as
he
felt
all
most
deeply
and
knew
how
to
estimate
the
variety
of
such
a
work
so
the
whole
merit
of
a
production
appeared
purely
and
the
more
clearly
as
one
was
not
disturbed
by
details
sharply
spoken
out
nor
interrupted
in
the
feeling
which
the
whole
was
meant
to
produce
a
protestant
country
clergyman
is
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
subject
for
a
modern
idyl
he
appears
like
melchizedek
as
priest
and
king
in
one
person
to
the
most
innocent
situation
which
can
be
imagined
on
earth
to
that
of
a
husbandman
he
is
for
the
most
part
united
by
similarity
of
occupation
as
well
as
by
equality
in
family
relationships
he
is
a
father
a
master
of
a
family
an
agriculturist
and
thus
perfectly
a
member
of
the
community
on
this
pure
beautiful
earthly
foundation
rests
his
higher
calling
to
him
is
it
given
to
guide
men
through
life
to
take
of
their
spiritual
education
to
bless
them
at
all
the
leading
epochs
of
their
existence
to
instruct
to
strengthen
to
console
them
and
if
consolation
is
not
sufficient
for
the
present
to
call
up
and
guarantee
the
hope
of
a
happier
future
imagine
such
a
man
with
pure
human
sentiments
strong
enough
not
to
deviate
from
them
under
any
circumstances
and
by
this
already
elevated
above
the
multitude
of
whom
one
can
not
expect
purity
and
firmness
give
him
the
learning
necessary
for
his
office
as
well
as
a
cheerful
equable
activity
which
is
even
passionate
as
it
neglects
no
moment
to
do
good
and
you
will
have
him
well
endowed
but
at
the
same
time
add
the
necessary
limitation
so
that
he
must
not
only
pause
in
a
small
circle
but
may
also
perchance
pass
over
to
a
smaller
grant
him
placability
resolution
and
everything
else
praiseworthy
that
springs
from
a
decided
character
and
over
all
this
a
cheerful
spirit
of
compliance
and
a
smiling
toleration
of
his
own
failings
and
those
of
others
then
you
will
have
put
together
pretty
well
the
image
of
our
excellent
wakefield
the
vicar
of
wakefield
the
delineation
of
this
character
on
his
course
of
life
through
joys
and
sorrows
the
interest
of
the
story
by
the
combination
of
the
entirely
natural
with
the
strange
and
the
singular
make
this
novel
one
of
the
best
which
has
ever
been
written
besides
this
it
has
the
great
advantage
that
it
is
quite
moral
nay
in
a
pure
sense
christian
represents
the
reward
of
a
good
will
and
perseverance
in
the
right
strengthens
an
unconditional
confidence
in
god
and
attests
the
final
triumph
of
good
over
evil
and
all
this
without
a
trace
of
cant
or
pedantry
the
author
was
preserved
from
both
of
these
by
an
elevation
of
mind
that
shows
itself
throughout
in
the
form
of
irony
by
which
this
little
work
must
appear
to
us
as
wise
as
it
is
amiable
the
author
goldsmith
has
without
question
great
insight
into
the
moral
world
into
its
strength
and
its
infirmities
but
at
the
same
time
he
can
thankfully
acknowledge
that
he
is
an
englishman
and
reckon
highly
the
advantages
which
his
country
and
his
nation
afford
him
the
family
with
the
delineation
of
which
he
occupies
himself
stands
upon
one
of
the
last
steps
of
citizen
comfort
and
yet
comes
in
contact
with
the
highest
its
narrow
circle
which
becomes
still
more
contracted
touches
upon
the
great
world
through
the
natural
and
civil
course
of
things
this
little
skiff
floats
on
the
agitated
waves
of
english
life
and
in
weal
or
woe
it
has
to
expect
injury
or
help
from
the
vast
fleet
which
sails
around
it
i
may
suppose
that
my
readers
know
this
work
and
have
it
in
memory
whoever
hears
it
named
for
the
first
time
here
as
well
as
he
who
is
induced
to
read
it
again
will
thank
me
for
the
former
i
would
merely
make
the
cursory
remark
that
the
vicar
wife
is
of
that
good
busy
sort
who
allows
herself
and
her
own
to
want
for
nothing
but
who
is
also
somewhat
vain
of
herself
and
her
own
there
are
two
daughters
olivia
handsome
and
more
devoted
to
the
external
and
sophia
charming
and
more
given
to
the
internal
nor
will
i
omit
to
mention
an
industrious
son
moses
who
is
somewhat
blunt
and
emulous
of
his
father
if
herder
could
be
accused
of
any
fault
in
his
reading
aloud
it
was
impatience
he
did
not
wait
until
the
hearer
had
heard
and
comprehended
a
certain
part
of
the
progress
so
as
to
be
able
to
feel
and
think
correctly
about
it
hurrying
on
he
would
see
their
effect
at
once
and
yet
he
was
displeased
even
with
this
when
it
manifested
itself
he
blamed
the
excess
of
feeling
which
overflowed
from
me
more
and
more
at
every
step
i
felt
like
a
man
like
a
young
man
everything
was
living
true
and
present
before
me
he
considering
only
the
intrinsic
contents
and
form
saw
clearly
indeed
that
i
was
overpowered
by
the
and
this
he
would
not
allow
then
peglow
reflections
which
were
not
of
the
most
refined
were
still
worse
received
but
he
was
especially
angry
at
our
want
of
keenness
in
not
seeing
beforehand
the
contrasts
of
which
the
author
often
makes
use
and
in
suffering
ourselves
to
be
moved
and
carried
away
by
them
without
remarking
the
artifice
he
would
not
pardon
us
for
not
seeing
at
once
or
at
least
suspecting
at
the
very
beginning
where
burchell
is
on
the
point
of
discovering
himself
by
passing
over
in
his
narration
from
the
third
to
the
first
person
that
he
himself
is
the
lord
of
whom
he
is
speaking
and
when
finally
we
rejoiced
like
children
at
the
discovery
and
the
transformation
of
the
poor
needy
wanderer
into
a
rich
powerful
lord
he
immediately
recalled
the
passage
which
according
to
the
author
plan
we
had
overlooked
and
read
us
a
powerful
lecture
on
our
stupidity
it
wall
be
seen
from
this
that
he
regarded
the
work
merely
as
a
production
of
art
and
required
the
same
of
us
who
were
yet
wandering
in
that
state
where
it
is
very
allowable
to
let
works
of
art
affect
us
like
productions
of
nature
i
did
not
suffer
myself
to
be
at
all
perplexed
by
herder
invectives
for
young
people
have
the
happiness
or
unhappiness
that
when
once
anything
has
produced
an
effect
on
them
this
effect
must
be
wrought
out
within
themselves
from
which
much
good
as
well
as
much
mischief
arises
the
above
work
had
left
with
me
a
great
impression
for
which
i
could
not
account
but
properly
speaking
i
felt
myself
in
harmony
with
that
ironical
tone
of
mind
which
elevates
itself
above
every
object
above
fortune
and
misfortune
good
and
evil
death
and
life
and
thus
attains
to
the
possession
of
a
truly
poetical
world
i
could
not
indeed
become
conscious
of
this
until
later
it
was
enough
that
it
gave
me
much
to
do
at
the
moment
but
i
could
by
no
means
have
expected
to
be
so
soon
transposed
from
this
fictitious
world
into
a
similar
real
one
pleasures
of
travelling
incognito
my
weyland
who
enlivened
his
quiet
laborious
life
by
visiting
from
time
to
time
his
friends
and
relations
in
the
country
for
he
was
a
native
of
alsace
did
me
many
services
on
my
little
excursions
by
introducing
me
to
different
localities
and
families
sometimes
in
person
sometimes
by
recommendations
he
had
often
spoken
to
me
about
a
country
clergyman
who
lived
near
drusenheim
six
leagues
from
strasburg
in
possession
of
a
good
benefice
with
an
intelligent
wife
and
a
pair
of
amiable
daughters
the
hospitality
and
agreeableness
of
this
family
were
always
highly
extolled
it
scarcely
needed
so
much
to
draw
thither
a
young
knight
who
had
already
accustomed
himself
to
spend
all
his
leisure
days
and
hours
on
horseback
and
in
the
open
air
we
decided
therefore
upon
this
trip
and
my
friend
had
to
promise
that
on
introducing
me
he
would
say
neither
good
nor
ill
of
me
but
would
treat
me
with
general
indifference
and
would
allow
me
to
make
my
appearance
clad
if
not
meanly
yet
somewhat
poorly
and
negligently
he
consented
to
this
and
promised
himself
some
sport
from
it
it
is
a
pardonable
whim
in
men
of
consequence
to
place
their
exterior
advantages
in
concealment
now
and
then
so
as
to
allow
their
own
internal
human
nature
to
operate
with
the
greater
purity
for
this
reason
the
incognito
of
princes
and
the
adventures
resulting
therefrom
are
always
highly
pleasing
these
appear
disguised
divinities
who
can
reckon
at
double
its
value
all
the
good
offices
shown
to
them
as
individuals
and
are
in
such
a
position
that
they
can
either
make
light
of
the
disagreeable
or
avoid
it
that
jupiter
should
be
well
pleased
in
his
incognito
with
philemon
and
baucis
and
henry
the
fourth
with
his
peasants
after
a
hunting
party
is
quite
conformable
to
nature
and
we
like
it
well
but
that
a
young
man
without
importance
or
name
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
derive
some
pleasure
from
an
incognito
might
be
construed
by
many
as
an
unpardonable
piece
of
arrogance
yet
since
the
question
here
is
not
of
such
views
and
actions
so
far
as
they
are
praiseworthy
or
blameable
but
so
far
as
they
can
manifest
themselves
and
actually
occur
we
will
on
this
occasion
for
the
sake
of
our
own
amusement
pardon
the
youngster
his
and
the
more
so
as
i
must
here
allege
that
from
youth
upwards
a
love
for
disguising
myself
had
been
excited
in
me
even
by
my
stem
father
this
time
too
partly
by
some
clothes
of
my
own
partly
by
some
borrowed
garments
and
by
the
manner
of
combing
my
hair
i
had
if
not
disfigured
myself
yet
at
least
decked
myself
out
so
oddly
that
my
friend
could
not
help
laughing
on
the
way
especially
as
i
knew
how
to
imitate
perfectly
the
bearing
and
gestures
of
such
figures
when
they
sit
on
horseback
and
which
are
called
latin
riders
the
fine
road
the
most
splendid
weather
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
rhine
put
us
in
the
best
humour
at
drusenheim
we
stopped
a
moment
he
to
make
himself
spruce
and
i
to
rehearse
my
part
out
of
which
i
was
afraid
i
should
now
and
then
fall
the
country
here
has
the
characteristics
of
all
the
open
level
alsace
we
rode
on
a
pleasant
over
the
meadows
soon
reached
sesenheim
left
our
horses
at
the
tavern
and
walked
leisurely
towards
the
parsonage
do
not
be
put
out
said
weyland
showing
me
the
house
from
a
distance
because
it
looks
like
an
old
miserable
it
is
so
much
the
younger
inside
we
stepped
into
the
the
whole
pleased
me
well
for
it
had
exactly
that
which
is
called
picturesque
and
which
had
so
magically
interested
me
in
dutch
art
the
effect
which
time
produces
on
all
human
work
was
strongly
perceptible
house
barn
and
stable
were
just
at
that
point
of
dilapidation
where
indecisive
and
doubtful
between
preserving
and
rebuilding
one
often
neglects
the
one
without
being
able
to
accomplish
the
other
the
pastor
family
as
in
the
village
so
in
the
all
was
quiet
and
deserted
we
found
the
father
a
little
man
wrapped
up
within
himself
but
friendly
notwithstanding
quite
alone
for
the
family
were
in
the
fields
he
bade
us
welcome
and
offered
us
some
refreshment
which
we
declined
my
friend
hurried
away
to
look
after
the
ladies
and
i
remained
alone
with
our
host
you
are
perhaps
surprised
said
he
to
find
me
so
miserably
quartered
in
a
wealthy
village
and
with
a
lucrative
benefice
but
he
continued
this
proceeds
from
irresolution
long
since
it
has
been
promised
me
by
the
parish
and
even
by
those
in
higher
places
that
the
house
shall
be
rebuilt
many
plans
have
been
already
drawn
examined
and
altered
none
of
them
altogether
rejected
and
none
carried
into
execution
this
has
lasted
so
many
years
that
i
scarcely
know
how
to
command
my
impatience
i
made
him
an
answer
such
as
i
thought
likely
to
cherish
his
hopes
and
to
encourage
him
to
pursue
the
affair
more
vigorously
upon
this
he
proceeded
to
describe
familiarly
the
personages
on
whom
such
matters
depended
and
although
he
was
no
great
delineator
of
character
i
could
nevertheless
easily
comprehend
how
the
whole
business
must
have
been
delayed
the
confidential
tone
of
the
man
was
something
peculiar
he
talked
to
me
as
if
he
had
known
me
for
ten
years
while
there
was
nothing
in
his
look
from
which
i
could
have
suspected
that
he
was
directing
any
attention
to
me
at
last
my
friend
came
in
with
the
mother
she
seemed
to
look
at
me
with
quite
different
eyes
her
countenance
was
regular
and
the
expression
of
it
intelligent
she
must
have
been
beautiful
in
her
youth
her
figure
was
tall
and
spare
but
not
more
so
than
became
her
years
and
when
seen
from
behind
she
had
yet
quite
a
youthful
and
pleasing
appearance
the
elder
daughter
then
came
bouncing
in
briskly
she
inquired
after
frederica
just
as
both
the
others
had
also
done
the
father
assured
them
that
he
had
not
seen
her
since
all
three
had
gone
out
together
the
daughter
again
went
out
at
the
door
to
look
for
her
sister
the
mother
brought
us
some
refreshment
and
weyland
with
the
old
couple
continued
the
conversation
which
referred
to
nothing
but
known
persons
and
circumstances
as
indeed
it
is
usually
the
case
when
acquaintances
meet
after
some
length
of
time
that
they
make
inquiries
and
mutually
give
each
other
information
about
the
members
of
a
large
circle
i
listened
and
now
learned
how
much
i
had
to
promise
myself
from
this
circle
the
elder
daughter
again
came
hastily
back
into
the
room
uneasy
at
not
having
found
her
sister
they
were
anxious
about
her
and
blamed
her
for
this
or
that
bad
habit
only
the
father
said
very
composedly
let
her
alone
she
has
already
come
back
at
this
instant
she
really
entered
the
door
and
then
truly
a
most
charming
star
arose
in
this
rural
heaven
both
daughters
still
wore
nothing
but
german
as
they
used
to
call
it
and
this
almost
obsolete
national
costume
became
frederica
particularly
well
a
short
white
full
skirt
with
a
furbelow
not
so
long
but
that
the
neatest
little
feet
were
visible
up
to
the
ankle
a
tight
white
bodice
and
a
black
taffeta
apron
thus
she
stood
on
the
boundary
between
country
girl
and
city
girl
slender
and
light
she
tripped
along
as
if
she
had
nothing
to
carry
and
her
neck
seemed
almost
too
delicate
for
the
large
fair
braids
on
her
elegant
little
head
from
cheerful
blue
eyes
she
looked
very
plainly
round
and
her
pretty
nose
peered
as
freely
into
the
air
as
if
there
could
be
no
care
in
the
world
her
straw
hat
hung
on
her
arm
and
thus
at
the
first
glance
i
had
the
delight
of
seeing
her
and
acknowledging
her
at
once
in
all
her
grace
and
loveliness
i
now
began
to
act
my
character
with
moderation
half
ashamed
to
play
a
joke
on
such
good
people
whom
i
had
time
enough
to
observe
for
the
girls
continued
the
previous
conversation
and
that
with
passion
and
some
display
of
temper
all
the
neighbours
and
connexions
were
again
brought
forward
and
there
seemed
to
my
imagination
such
a
swarm
of
uncles
and
aunts
relations
cousins
comers
goers
gossips
and
guests
that
i
thought
myself
lodged
in
the
liveliest
world
possible
all
the
members
of
the
family
had
spoken
some
words
with
me
the
mother
looked
at
me
every
time
she
came
in
or
went
out
but
frederica
first
entered
into
conversation
with
me
and
as
i
took
up
and
glanced
through
some
music
that
was
lying
around
she
asked
me
if
i
played
also
when
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
she
requested
me
to
perform
something
but
the
father
would
not
allow
this
for
he
maintained
that
it
was
proper
to
serve
the
guest
first
with
some
piece
of
music
or
a
song
she
played
several
things
with
some
readiness
in
the
style
which
one
usually
hears
in
the
country
and
on
a
harpsichord
too
that
the
schoolmaster
should
have
tuned
long
since
if
he
had
only
had
time
she
was
now
to
sing
a
song
also
a
certain
affair
but
she
did
not
succeed
in
it
she
rose
up
and
said
smiling
or
rather
with
that
touch
of
serene
joy
which
ever
reposed
on
her
countenance
if
i
sing
badly
i
can
not
lay
the
blame
on
the
harpsichord
or
the
schoolmaster
but
let
us
go
out
of
doors
then
you
shall
hear
my
alsatian
and
swiss
songs
they
sound
much
better
comparison
with
the
vicar
of
wakefield
during
supper
a
notion
which
had
already
struck
me
occupied
me
to
such
a
degree
that
i
became
meditative
and
silent
although
the
liveliness
of
the
elder
sister
and
the
gracefulness
of
the
younger
shook
me
often
enough
out
of
my
contemplations
my
astonishment
at
finding
myself
so
actually
in
the
wakefield
family
was
beyond
all
expression
the
father
indeed
could
not
be
compared
with
that
excellent
man
but
where
will
you
find
his
like
on
the
other
hand
all
the
dignity
which
is
peculiar
to
that
husband
here
appeared
in
the
wife
one
could
not
see
her
without
at
the
same
time
reverencing
and
fearing
her
in
her
were
remarked
the
fruits
of
a
good
education
her
demeanour
was
quiet
easy
cheerful
and
inviting
if
the
elder
daughter
had
not
the
celebrated
beauty
of
olivia
yet
she
was
lively
and
rather
impetuous
she
everywhere
showed
herself
active
and
lent
a
helping
hand
to
her
mother
in
all
things
to
put
frederica
in
the
place
of
primrose
sophia
was
not
difficult
for
little
is
said
of
the
latter
it
is
only
taken
for
granted
that
she
is
amiable
and
this
girl
was
amiable
indeed
now
as
the
same
occupation
and
the
same
situation
wherever
they
may
occur
produce
similar
if
not
the
same
effects
so
here
too
many
things
were
talked
about
many
things
happened
which
had
already
taken
place
in
the
wakefield
family
but
when
at
last
a
younger
son
long
announced
and
impatiently
expected
by
the
father
at
last
sprang
into
the
room
and
boldly
sat
himself
down
by
us
taking
but
little
notice
of
the
guests
i
could
scarcely
help
exclaiming
moses
are
you
here
too
the
conversation
at
table
extended
my
insight
into
this
country
and
family
circle
since
the
discourse
was
about
various
droll
incidents
which
had
happened
now
here
now
there
frederica
who
sat
by
me
thence
took
occasion
to
describe
to
me
different
localities
which
it
was
worth
while
to
visit
as
one
little
story
always
calls
forth
another
i
was
able
to
mingle
so
much
the
better
in
the
conversation
and
to
relate
similar
incidents
and
as
besides
this
a
good
country
wine
was
by
no
means
spared
i
stood
in
danger
of
slipping
out
of
my
character
for
which
reason
my
more
prudent
friend
took
advantage
of
the
beautiful
moonlight
and
proposed
a
walk
which
was
approved
at
once
he
gave
his
arm
to
the
elder
i
to
the
younger
and
thus
we
went
through
the
wide
field
paying
more
attention
to
the
heavens
above
us
than
to
the
earth
which
lost
itself
in
extension
around
us
there
was
however
nothing
of
moonshine
in
frederica
discourse
by
the
clearness
with
which
she
spoke
she
turned
night
into
day
and
there
was
nothing
in
it
which
would
have
indicated
or
excited
any
feeling
except
that
her
expressions
related
more
than
hitherto
to
me
since
she
represented
to
me
her
own
situation
as
well
as
the
neighbourhood
and
her
acquaintances
just
as
far
as
i
should
be
acquainted
with
them
for
she
hoped
she
added
i
would
make
no
exception
and
would
visit
them
again
as
all
strangers
had
willingly
done
who
had
once
stopped
with
them
it
was
very
pleasant
to
me
to
listen
silently
to
the
description
which
she
gave
of
the
little
world
in
which
she
moved
and
of
the
persons
whom
she
particularly
valued
she
thereby
imparted
to
me
a
clear
and
at
the
same
time
such
an
amiable
idea
of
her
situation
that
it
had
a
very
strange
effect
on
me
for
i
felt
at
once
a
deep
regret
that
i
had
not
lived
with
her
sooner
and
at
the
same
time
a
truly
painful
envious
feeling
towards
all
who
had
hitherto
had
the
good
fortune
to
surround
her
i
at
once
watched
closely
as
if
i
had
a
right
to
do
so
all
her
descriptions
of
men
whether
they
appeared
under
the
names
of
neighbours
cousins
or
gossips
and
my
conjectures
inclined
now
this
way
now
that
but
how
could
i
have
discovered
anything
in
my
complete
ignorance
of
all
the
circumstances
she
at
last
became
more
and
more
talkative
and
i
more
and
more
silent
it
was
so
pleasant
to
listen
to
her
and
as
i
heard
only
her
voice
while
the
form
of
her
countenance
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
world
floated
dimly
in
the
twilight
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
i
could
see
into
her
heart
which
i
could
not
but
find
very
pure
since
it
unbosomed
itself
to
me
in
such
unembarrassed
loquacity
comparison
with
the
vicar
of
wakefield
when
my
companion
retired
with
me
into
the
which
was
prepared
for
us
he
at
once
with
broke
out
into
pleasant
jesting
and
took
great
credit
to
himself
for
having
surprised
me
so
much
with
the
similarity
to
the
primrose
family
i
chimed
in
with
him
by
showing
myself
thankful
truly
cried
he
the
story
is
quite
complete
this
family
may
very
well
be
compared
to
that
and
the
gentleman
in
disguise
here
may
assume
the
honour
of
passing
for
burchell
moreover
since
scoundrels
are
not
so
necessary
in
common
life
as
in
novels
i
will
for
this
time
undertake
the
of
the
nephew
and
behave
myself
better
than
he
did
however
i
immediately
changed
this
conversation
pleasant
as
it
might
be
to
me
and
asked
him
before
all
things
on
his
conscience
if
he
had
not
really
betrayed
me
he
answered
me
no
and
i
could
believe
him
they
had
rather
inquired
said
he
after
the
merry
who
boarded
at
the
same
house
with
him
in
strasburg
and
of
whom
they
had
been
told
all
sorts
of
preposterous
stuff
i
now
went
to
other
questions
had
she
ever
been
in
love
was
she
now
in
love
was
she
engaged
he
replied
to
all
in
the
negative
in
truth
replied
i
such
a
cheerfulness
by
nature
is
inconceivable
to
me
had
she
loved
and
lost
and
again
recovered
herself
or
had
she
been
betrothed
in
both
these
cases
i
could
account
for
it
thus
we
chatted
together
far
into
the
night
and
i
was
awake
again
at
the
dawn
my
desire
to
see
her
once
more
seemed
unconquerable
but
while
i
dressed
myself
i
was
horrified
at
the
accursed
wardrobe
i
had
so
wantonly
selected
the
further
i
advanced
in
putting
on
my
clothes
the
meaner
i
seemed
in
my
own
eyes
for
everything
had
been
calculated
for
just
this
effect
my
hair
i
might
perchance
have
set
to
rights
but
when
at
last
i
forced
myself
into
the
borrowed
grey
coat
and
the
short
sleeves
gave
me
the
most
absurd
appearance
i
fell
the
more
decidedly
into
despair
as
i
could
see
myself
only
piecemeal
in
a
little
since
one
part
always
looked
more
ridiculous
than
the
other
during
this
toilette
my
friend
awoke
and
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
good
conscience
and
in
the
feeling
of
pleasurable
hope
for
the
day
looked
out
at
me
from
the
quilted
silk
coverlet
i
had
for
a
long
time
already
envied
him
his
fine
clothes
as
they
hung
over
the
chair
and
had
he
been
of
my
size
i
would
have
carried
them
off
before
his
eyes
changed
my
dress
outside
and
hurrying
into
the
garden
left
my
cursed
husk
for
him
he
would
have
had
enough
to
put
himself
into
my
clothes
and
the
tale
would
have
found
a
merry
ending
early
in
the
morning
but
that
was
not
now
to
be
thought
of
no
more
was
any
other
feasible
accommodation
to
appear
again
before
frederica
in
the
figure
in
which
my
friend
could
give
me
out
as
a
laborious
and
accomplished
but
poor
student
of
theology
before
frederica
who
the
evening
before
had
spoken
so
friendly
to
my
disguised
self
that
was
altogether
impossible
there
i
stood
vexed
and
thoughtful
and
summoned
all
my
power
of
invention
but
it
deserted
me
but
now
when
he
comfortably
stretched
out
after
fixing
his
eyes
upon
me
for
a
while
all
at
once
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
and
exclaimed
no
it
is
true
you
do
look
most
cursedly
i
replied
impetuously
and
i
know
what
i
will
do
good
bye
and
make
my
excuses
are
you
mad
cried
he
out
of
bed
and
trying
to
detain
me
but
i
was
already
out
of
the
door
down
the
stairs
out
of
the
house
and
yard
off
to
the
tavern
in
an
instant
my
horse
was
saddled
and
i
hurried
away
in
mad
vexation
galloping
towards
drusenheim
then
through
that
place
and
still
further
on
as
i
now
thought
myself
in
safety
i
rode
more
slowly
and
now
first
felt
how
infinitely
against
my
will
i
was
going
away
but
i
resigned
myself
to
my
fate
made
present
to
my
mind
the
promenade
of
yesterday
evening
with
the
greatest
calmness
and
cherished
the
secret
hope
of
seeing
her
soon
again
but
this
quiet
feeling
soon
changed
itself
again
into
impatience
and
i
now
determined
to
ride
rapidly
into
the
city
change
my
dress
take
a
good
fresh
horse
since
then
as
my
passion
made
me
believe
i
could
at
all
events
return
before
dinner
or
as
was
more
probable
to
the
dessert
or
towards
evening
and
beg
my
forgiveness
the
exchange
of
clothes
i
was
just
about
to
put
spurs
to
my
horse
to
execute
this
plan
when
another
and
as
seemed
to
me
a
very
happy
thought
passed
through
my
mind
in
the
tavern
at
drusenheim
the
day
before
i
had
noticed
a
son
of
the
landlord
very
nicely
dressed
who
early
this
morning
being
busied
about
his
rural
arrangements
had
saluted
me
from
his
he
was
of
my
figure
and
had
for
the
moment
reminded
me
of
myself
no
sooner
thought
than
done
my
horse
was
hardly
turned
round
when
i
found
myself
in
drusenheim
i
brought
him
into
the
stable
and
in
a
few
words
made
the
fellow
my
proposal
namely
that
he
should
lend
me
his
clothes
as
i
had
something
merry
on
foot
at
sesenheim
i
had
no
need
to
talk
long
he
agreed
to
the
proposition
with
joy
and
praised
me
for
wishing
to
make
some
sport
for
the
they
were
he
said
such
capital
people
especially
mamselle
riekchen
and
the
parents
too
liked
to
see
everything
go
on
merrily
and
pleasantly
he
considered
me
attentively
and
as
from
my
appearance
he
might
have
taken
me
for
a
poor
starveling
he
said
if
you
wish
to
insinuate
yourself
this
is
the
right
way
in
the
meanwhile
we
had
already
proceeded
far
in
our
toilette
and
properly
speaking
he
should
not
have
trusted
me
with
his
holiday
clothes
on
the
strength
of
mine
but
he
was
and
moreover
had
my
horse
in
his
stable
i
soon
stood
there
smart
enough
gave
myself
a
consequential
air
and
my
friend
seemed
to
regard
his
counterpart
with
complacency
topp
mr
brother
said
he
giving
me
his
hand
which
i
grasped
heartily
come
too
near
my
girl
she
might
make
a
mistake
my
hair
which
had
now
its
full
growth
again
i
could
part
at
top
much
like
his
and
as
i
looked
at
him
repeatedly
i
found
it
comical
moderately
to
imitate
his
thicker
eyebrows
with
a
burnt
cork
and
bring
mine
nearer
together
in
the
middle
so
that
with
my
enigmatical
intentions
i
might
make
myself
an
external
riddle
likewise
now
have
you
not
said
i
as
he
handed
me
his
hat
something
or
other
to
be
done
at
the
parsonage
that
i
might
announce
myself
there
in
a
natural
manner
good
replied
he
but
then
you
must
wait
two
hours
yet
there
is
a
woman
confined
at
our
house
i
will
offer
to
take
the
cake
to
the
parson
wife
and
you
may
carry
it
over
pride
must
pay
its
penalty
and
so
must
a
joke
i
resolved
to
wait
but
these
two
hours
were
infinitely
long
and
i
was
dying
of
impatience
when
the
third
hour
passed
before
the
cake
came
out
of
the
oven
at
last
i
got
it
quite
hot
and
hastened
away
with
my
credentials
in
the
most
beautiful
sunshine
accompanied
for
a
distance
by
my
counterpart
who
promised
to
come
after
me
in
the
evening
and
bring
me
my
clothes
this
however
i
briskly
declined
and
stipulated
that
i
should
deliver
up
to
him
his
own
goethe
disguise
i
had
not
skipped
far
with
my
present
which
i
carried
in
a
neat
napkin
when
in
the
distance
i
saw
my
friend
coming
towards
me
with
the
two
ladies
my
heart
was
uneasy
which
was
certainly
unsuitable
under
this
jacket
i
stood
still
took
breath
and
tried
to
consider
how
i
should
begin
and
now
i
first
remarked
that
the
nature
of
the
ground
was
very
much
in
my
favour
for
they
were
walking
on
the
other
side
of
the
brook
which
together
with
the
strips
of
meadow
through
which
it
ran
kept
the
two
footpaths
pretty
far
apart
when
they
were
just
opposite
to
me
frederica
who
had
already
perceived
me
long
before
cried
george
what
are
you
bringing
there
i
was
clever
enough
to
cover
my
face
with
my
hat
which
i
took
off
while
i
held
up
the
loaded
napkin
high
in
the
air
a
christening
cake
cried
she
at
that
how
is
your
sister
well
said
i
for
i
tried
to
talk
in
a
strange
dialect
if
not
exactly
in
the
alsatian
carry
it
to
the
house
said
the
elder
and
if
you
do
not
find
my
mother
give
it
to
the
maid
but
wait
for
us
we
shall
soon
be
do
you
hear
i
hastened
along
my
path
in
the
joyous
feeling
of
the
best
hope
that
as
the
beginning
was
so
lucky
all
would
go
off
well
and
i
had
soon
reached
the
parsonage
i
found
nobody
either
in
the
house
or
in
the
kitchen
i
did
not
wish
to
disturb
the
old
gentleman
whom
i
might
suppose
busy
in
the
study
i
therefore
sat
down
on
the
bench
before
the
door
with
the
cake
beside
me
and
pressed
my
hat
upon
my
face
i
can
not
easily
recall
a
pleasanter
sensation
to
sit
again
on
this
threshold
over
which
a
short
time
before
i
had
blundered
out
in
despair
to
have
seen
her
already
again
to
have
already
heard
again
her
dear
voice
so
soon
after
my
chagrin
had
pictured
to
me
a
long
separation
every
moment
to
be
expecting
herself
and
a
discovery
at
which
my
heart
throbbed
and
yet
in
this
ambiguous
case
a
discovery
without
shame
for
at
the
very
beginning
it
was
a
merrier
prank
than
any
of
those
they
had
laughed
at
so
much
yesterday
love
and
necessity
are
the
best
masters
they
both
acted
together
here
and
their
pupil
was
not
unworthy
of
them
frederica
repose
but
the
maid
came
stepping
out
of
the
barn
now
did
the
cakes
turn
out
well
cried
she
to
me
how
is
your
sister
all
right
said
i
and
pointed
to
the
cake
without
looking
up
she
took
up
the
napkin
and
muttered
now
what
the
matter
with
you
again
has
barbchen
been
looking
again
at
somebody
else
do
let
us
suffer
for
that
you
will
make
a
happy
couple
if
you
carry
on
so
as
she
spoke
pretty
loud
the
pastor
came
to
the
window
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
she
showed
him
to
me
i
stood
up
and
turned
myself
towards
him
but
still
kept
the
hat
over
my
face
when
he
had
spoken
somewhat
friendly
to
me
and
had
asked
me
to
remain
i
went
towards
the
garden
and
was
just
going
in
when
the
pastor
wife
who
was
entering
the
courtyard
gate
called
to
me
as
the
sun
shone
right
in
my
face
i
one
more
availed
myself
of
the
advantage
which
my
hat
afforded
me
and
greeted
her
by
scraping
a
leg
but
she
went
into
the
house
after
she
had
bidden
me
not
to
go
away
without
eating
something
i
now
walked
up
and
down
in
the
garden
everything
had
hitherto
had
the
best
success
yet
i
breathed
hard
when
i
reflected
that
the
young
people
now
would
soon
return
but
the
mother
unexpectedly
stepped
up
to
me
and
was
just
going
to
ask
me
a
question
when
she
looked
me
in
the
face
so
that
i
could
not
conceal
myself
any
longer
and
the
words
stuck
in
her
throat
i
am
looking
for
george
said
she
after
a
pause
and
whom
do
i
find
is
it
you
young
sir
how
many
forms
have
you
then
in
earnest
only
one
replied
i
in
sport
as
many
as
you
like
which
sport
i
will
not
spoil
smiled
she
go
out
behind
the
garden
into
the
meadow
until
it
strikes
twelve
then
come
back
and
i
shall
already
have
contrived
the
joke
i
did
so
but
when
i
was
beyond
the
hedges
of
the
village
gardens
and
was
going
along
the
meadows
towards
me
some
country
people
came
by
the
footpath
and
put
me
in
some
embarrassment
i
therefore
turned
aside
into
a
little
wood
which
crowned
an
elevation
quite
near
in
order
to
conceal
myself
there
till
the
appointed
time
yet
how
strangely
did
i
feel
when
i
entered
it
for
there
appeared
before
me
a
neat
place
with
benches
from
every
one
of
which
was
a
pretty
view
of
the
country
here
was
the
village
and
the
steeple
here
drusenheim
and
behind
it
the
woody
islands
of
the
rhine
in
the
opposite
direction
was
the
vosgian
mountain
range
and
at
last
the
minster
of
strasburg
these
different
pictures
were
set
in
bushy
frames
so
that
one
could
see
nothing
more
joyous
and
pleasing
i
sat
down
upon
one
of
the
benches
and
noticed
on
the
largest
tree
an
oblong
little
board
with
the
inscription
repose
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
have
come
to
disturb
this
repose
for
a
budding
passion
has
this
beauty
about
it
that
as
it
is
unconscious
of
its
origin
neither
can
it
have
any
thought
of
an
end
nor
while
it
feels
itself
glad
and
cheerful
have
any
presentiment
that
it
may
also
create
mischief
i
had
scarcely
had
time
to
look
about
me
and
was
losing
myself
in
sweet
reveries
when
i
heard
somebody
coming
it
was
frederica
herself
george
what
are
you
doing
here
she
cried
from
a
distance
not
george
cried
i
running
towards
her
but
one
who
craves
forgiveness
of
you
a
thousand
rimes
she
looked
at
me
with
astonishment
but
soon
collected
herself
and
said
after
fetching
her
breath
more
deeply
you
abominable
man
how
you
frighten
me
the
first
disguise
has
led
me
into
the
second
exclaimed
i
the
former
would
have
been
unpardonable
if
i
had
only
known
in
any
degree
to
whom
i
was
going
but
this
one
you
will
certainly
forgive
for
it
is
the
shape
of
persons
whom
you
treat
so
kindly
her
pale
cheeks
had
coloured
up
with
the
most
beautiful
you
shall
not
be
worse
off
than
george
at
any
rate
but
let
us
sit
down
i
confess
the
fright
has
gone
into
my
limbs
i
sat
down
beside
her
exceedingly
agitated
we
know
everything
already
up
to
this
morning
from
your
friend
said
she
now
do
you
tell
me
the
rest
i
did
not
let
her
say
that
twice
but
described
to
her
my
horror
at
my
yesterday
figure
and
my
rushing
out
of
the
house
so
comically
that
she
laughed
heartily
and
graciously
then
i
went
on
to
what
followed
with
all
modesty
indeed
yet
passionately
enough
so
that
it
might
have
passed
for
a
declaration
of
love
in
historical
form
at
last
i
solemnized
my
pleasure
at
finding
her
again
by
a
kiss
upon
her
hand
which
she
suffered
to
remain
in
mine
if
she
had
taken
upon
herself
the
expense
of
the
conversation
during
yesterday
evening
moonlight
walk
i
now
on
my
part
richly
repaid
the
debt
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
again
and
being
able
to
say
to
her
everything
that
i
had
yesterday
kept
back
was
so
great
that
in
my
eloquence
i
did
not
remark
how
meditative
and
silent
she
was
once
more
she
deeply
fetched
her
breath
and
over
and
over
again
i
begged
her
forgiveness
for
the
fright
which
i
had
caused
her
how
long
we
may
have
sat
i
know
not
but
at
once
we
heard
some
one
call
it
was
the
voice
of
her
sister
that
will
be
a
pretty
story
said
the
dear
girl
restored
to
her
perfect
cheerfulness
she
is
coming
hither
on
my
side
she
added
bending
so
as
half
to
conceal
me
turn
yourself
away
so
that
you
may
not
be
recognised
at
once
the
sister
entered
the
place
but
not
alone
weyland
was
with
her
and
both
when
they
saw
us
stood
still
as
if
petrified
if
we
should
all
at
once
see
a
flame
burst
out
violently
from
a
quiet
roof
or
should
meet
a
monster
whose
deformity
was
at
the
same
time
revolting
and
fearful
we
should
not
be
struck
with
such
a
fierce
horror
as
that
which
seizes
us
when
unexpectedly
we
see
with
our
own
eyes
what
we
have
believed
morally
impossible
what
is
this
cried
the
elder
with
the
rapidity
of
one
who
is
frightened
what
is
this
you
with
george
how
am
i
to
understand
this
dear
sister
replied
frederica
very
doubtfully
the
poor
fellow
he
is
begging
something
of
me
he
has
something
to
beg
of
you
too
but
you
must
forgive
him
beforehand
i
do
not
understand
i
do
not
comprehend
said
her
sister
shaking
her
head
and
looking
at
weyland
who
in
his
quiet
way
stood
by
in
perfect
tranquillity
and
contemplated
the
scene
without
any
kind
of
expression
frederica
arose
and
drew
me
after
her
no
hesitating
cried
she
pardon
begged
and
granted
now
do
said
i
stepping
pretty
near
the
elder
i
have
need
of
pardon
she
drew
back
gave
a
loud
shriek
and
was
covered
with
blushes
she
then
threw
herself
down
on
the
grass
laughed
immoderately
and
seemed
as
if
she
would
never
have
done
weyland
smiled
as
if
pleased
and
cried
you
are
a
rare
youth
then
he
shook
my
hand
in
his
he
was
not
usually
liberal
with
his
caresses
but
his
shake
of
the
hand
had
something
hearty
and
enlivening
about
it
yet
he
was
sparing
of
this
also
after
somewhat
recovering
and
collecting
ourselves
we
set
out
on
our
return
to
the
village
on
the
way
i
learned
how
this
singular
meeting
had
been
occasioned
frederica
had
at
last
parted
from
the
promenaders
to
rest
herself
in
her
little
nook
for
a
moment
before
dinner
and
when
the
other
two
came
back
to
the
house
the
mother
had
sent
them
to
call
frederica
with
as
great
haste
as
possible
because
dinner
was
ready
the
elder
sister
manifested
the
most
extravagant
delight
and
when
she
learned
that
the
mother
had
already
discovered
the
secret
she
exclaimed
now
we
have
still
to
deceive
my
father
my
brother
the
and
the
maid
when
we
were
at
the
frederica
insisted
upon
going
first
into
the
house
with
my
friend
the
maid
was
busy
in
the
and
olivia
so
let
the
elder
sister
be
named
here
called
out
to
her
stop
i
have
something
to
tell
you
she
left
me
standing
by
the
hedge
and
went
to
the
maid
i
saw
that
they
were
speaking
very
earnestly
olivia
represented
to
her
that
george
had
quarrelled
with
barbara
and
seemed
desirous
of
marrying
her
the
lass
was
not
displeased
at
this
i
was
now
called
and
was
to
confirm
what
had
been
said
the
pretty
stout
girl
cast
down
her
eyes
and
remained
so
until
i
stood
quite
near
before
her
but
when
all
at
once
she
perceived
the
strange
face
she
too
gave
a
loud
scream
and
ran
away
olivia
bade
me
run
after
her
and
hold
her
fast
so
that
she
should
not
get
into
the
house
and
make
a
noise
while
she
herself
wished
to
go
and
see
how
it
was
with
her
father
on
the
way
olivia
met
the
who
was
in
love
with
the
maid
i
had
in
the
mean
time
hurried
after
the
maid
and
held
her
fast
only
think
what
good
luck
cried
olivia
it
all
over
with
barbara
and
george
marries
liese
that
i
have
thought
for
a
long
while
said
the
good
fellow
and
remained
standing
in
an
goethe
disguise
i
had
given
the
maid
to
understand
that
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
deceive
the
father
we
went
up
to
the
lad
who
turned
away
and
tried
to
withdraw
but
liese
brought
him
back
and
he
too
when
he
was
undeceived
made
the
most
extraordinary
gestures
we
went
together
to
the
house
the
table
was
covered
and
the
father
was
already
in
the
room
olivia
who
kept
me
behind
her
stepped
to
the
threshold
and
said
father
have
you
any
objection
to
george
dining
with
us
today
but
you
must
let
him
keep
his
hat
on
with
all
my
heart
said
the
old
man
but
why
such
an
unusual
thing
has
he
hurt
himself
she
led
me
forward
as
i
stood
with
my
hat
on
no
said
she
leading
me
into
the
room
but
he
has
a
under
it
and
the
birds
might
fly
out
and
make
a
terrible
fuss
for
there
are
nothing
but
wild
ones
the
father
was
pleased
with
the
joke
without
precisely
knowing
what
it
meant
at
this
instant
she
took
off
my
hat
made
a
scrape
and
required
me
to
do
the
same
the
old
man
looked
at
me
and
recognised
me
but
was
not
put
out
of
his
priestly
aye
aye
mr
candidate
exclaimed
he
raising
a
threatening
finger
at
me
you
have
changed
saddles
very
quickly
and
in
the
night
i
have
lost
an
assistant
who
yesterday
promised
me
so
faithfully
that
he
would
often
mount
my
pulpit
on
he
then
laughed
heartily
bade
me
welcome
and
we
sat
down
to
table
moses
came
in
much
later
for
as
the
youngest
spoiled
child
he
had
accustomed
himself
not
to
hear
the
besides
he
took
very
little
notice
of
the
company
scarcely
even
when
he
contradicted
them
in
order
to
be
more
sure
of
him
they
had
placed
me
not
between
the
sisters
but
at
the
end
of
the
table
where
george
often
used
to
sit
as
he
came
in
at
the
door
behind
me
he
slapped
me
smartly
on
the
shoulder
and
said
good
dinner
to
you
george
many
thanks
squire
replied
i
the
strange
voice
and
the
strange
face
startled
him
what
say
you
cried
olivia
does
he
not
look
very
like
his
brother
yes
from
behind
replied
moses
who
managed
to
recover
his
composure
immediately
like
all
folks
he
did
not
look
at
me
again
and
merely
busied
himself
with
zealously
devouring
the
dishes
to
make
up
for
lost
time
then
too
he
thought
proper
to
rise
on
occasion
and
find
something
to
do
in
the
yard
and
the
garden
at
the
dessert
the
real
george
came
in
and
made
the
whole
scene
still
more
lively
they
began
to
banter
him
for
his
jealousy
and
would
not
praise
him
for
getting
rid
of
a
rival
in
me
but
he
was
modest
and
clever
enough
and
in
a
manner
mixed
up
himself
his
sweetheart
his
counterpart
and
the
with
each
other
to
such
a
degree
that
at
last
nobody
could
tell
about
whom
he
was
talking
and
they
were
but
too
glad
to
let
him
consume
in
peace
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
bit
of
his
own
cake
the
new
melusina
at
table
there
was
some
talk
about
going
to
walk
which
however
did
not
suit
me
very
well
in
my
peasant
clothes
but
the
ladies
early
on
that
day
already
when
they
learned
who
had
run
away
in
such
a
desperate
hurry
had
remembered
that
a
fine
of
a
cousin
of
theirs
in
which
when
there
he
used
to
go
sporting
was
hanging
in
the
i
however
declined
it
externally
with
all
sorts
of
jokes
but
internally
with
a
feeling
of
vanity
not
wishing
as
the
cousin
to
disturb
the
good
impression
i
had
made
as
the
peasant
the
father
had
gone
to
take
his
the
mother
as
always
was
busy
about
her
housewifery
but
my
friend
proposed
that
i
should
tell
them
some
story
to
which
i
immediately
agreed
we
went
into
a
spacious
arbour
and
i
gave
them
a
tale
which
i
have
since
written
out
under
the
title
of
new
it
bears
about
the
same
relation
to
new
as
the
youth
bears
to
the
boy
and
i
would
insert
it
here
were
i
not
afraid
of
injuring
by
odd
plays
of
fancy
the
rural
reality
and
simplicity
which
here
agreeably
surround
us
enough
i
succeeded
in
gaining
the
reward
of
the
inventors
and
narrators
of
such
productions
namely
in
awakening
curiosity
in
fixing
the
attention
in
provoking
overhasty
solutions
of
impenetrable
riddles
in
deceiving
expectations
in
confusing
by
the
more
wonderful
which
came
into
the
place
of
the
wonderful
in
arousing
sympathy
and
fear
in
causing
anxiety
in
moving
and
at
last
by
the
change
of
what
was
apparently
earnest
into
an
ingenious
and
cheerful
jest
in
satisfying
the
mind
and
in
leaving
the
imagination
materials
for
new
images
and
the
understanding
materials
for
further
reflection
should
any
one
hereafter
read
this
tale
in
print
and
doubt
whether
it
could
have
produced
such
an
effect
let
him
remember
that
properly
speaking
man
is
only
called
upon
to
act
in
the
present
writing
is
an
abuse
of
language
reading
silently
to
oneself
is
a
pitiful
substitute
for
speech
man
effects
all
he
can
upon
man
by
his
personality
youth
is
most
powerful
upon
youth
and
hence
also
arise
the
purest
influences
it
is
these
which
enliven
the
world
and
allow
it
neither
morally
nor
physically
to
perish
i
had
inherited
from
my
father
a
certain
didactic
loquacity
from
my
mother
the
faculty
of
representing
clearly
and
forcibly
everything
that
the
imagination
can
produce
or
grasp
of
giving
a
freshness
to
known
stories
of
inventing
and
relating
others
nay
of
inventing
in
the
course
of
narration
by
my
paternal
endowment
i
was
for
the
most
part
annoying
to
the
company
for
who
likes
to
listen
to
the
opinions
and
sentiments
of
another
especially
a
youth
whose
judgment
from
defective
experience
always
seems
insufficient
my
mother
on
the
contrary
had
thoroughly
qualified
me
for
social
conversation
the
emptiest
tale
has
in
itself
a
high
charm
for
the
imagination
and
the
smallest
quantity
of
solid
matter
is
thankfully
received
by
the
understanding
by
such
recitals
which
cost
me
nothing
i
made
myself
beloved
by
children
excited
and
delighted
youth
and
drew
upon
myself
the
attention
of
older
persons
but
in
society
such
as
it
commonly
is
i
was
soon
obliged
to
stop
these
exercises
and
i
have
thereby
lost
but
too
much
of
the
enjoyment
of
life
and
of
free
mental
advancement
nevertheless
both
these
parental
gifts
accompanied
me
throughout
my
whole
life
united
with
a
third
namely
the
necessity
of
expressing
myself
figuratively
and
by
comparisons
in
consideration
of
these
peculiarities
which
the
acute
and
ingenious
doctor
gall
discovered
in
me
according
to
his
theory
he
assured
me
that
i
was
properly
speaking
born
for
a
popular
orator
at
this
disclosure
i
was
not
a
little
alarmed
for
if
it
had
been
here
well
founded
everything
that
i
undertook
would
have
proved
a
failure
from
the
fact
that
with
my
nation
there
was
nothing
to
harangue
about
the
german
word
is
koth
and
the
whole
object
of
the
line
is
to
introduce
a
play
on
the
words
göthe
götter
gothen
and
koth
that
is
towards
germany
is
by
abbreviation
for
the
exclamation
used
on
striking
a
bargain
it
is
we
believe
employed
by
some
trades
in
f
the
general
custom
of
the
country
villages
in
protestant
germany
on
such
interesting

eleventh
book
after
i
had
in
that
bower
of
sesenheim
finished
my
tale
in
which
the
ordinary
and
the
impossible
were
so
agreeably
alternated
i
perceived
that
my
hearers
who
had
already
shown
peculiar
sympathy
were
now
enchanted
in
the
highest
degree
by
my
singular
narrative
they
pressed
me
urgently
to
write
down
the
tale
that
they
might
often
repeat
it
by
reading
it
among
themselves
and
to
others
i
promised
this
the
more
willingly
as
i
thus
hoped
to
gain
a
pretext
for
repeating
my
visit
and
for
an
opportunity
of
forming
a
closer
connexion
the
party
separated
for
a
moment
and
all
were
inclined
to
feel
that
after
a
day
spent
in
so
lively
a
manner
the
evening
might
fall
rather
flat
from
this
anxiety
i
was
freed
by
my
friend
who
asked
permission
to
take
leave
at
once
in
the
name
of
us
both
because
as
an
industrious
academical
citizen
regular
in
his
studies
he
wished
to
pass
the
night
at
drusenheim
and
to
be
early
in
the
morning
at
strasburg
we
both
reached
our
in
silence
i
because
i
felt
a
grapple
on
my
heart
which
drew
me
back
he
because
he
had
something
else
on
his
mind
which
he
told
me
as
soon
as
we
had
arrived
it
is
strange
he
began
that
you
should
just
hit
upon
this
tale
did
not
you
remark
that
it
made
quite
a
peculiar
impression
nay
answered
i
how
could
i
help
observing
that
the
elder
one
laughed
more
than
was
consistent
at
certain
passages
that
the
younger
one
shook
her
head
that
all
of
you
looked
significantly
at
each
other
and
that
you
yourself
were
nearly
put
out
of
countenance
i
do
not
deny
that
i
almost
felt
embarrassed
myself
for
it
struck
me
that
it
was
perhaps
improper
to
tell
the
dear
girls
a
parcel
of
stuff
of
which
they
had
better
been
ignorant
and
to
give
them
such
a
bad
opinion
of
the
male
sex
as
they
must
naturally
have
formed
from
the
character
of
the
hero
you
have
not
hit
it
at
all
said
he
and
indeed
how
should
you
these
dear
girls
are
not
so
unacquainted
with
such
matters
as
you
imagine
for
the
great
society
around
them
gives
occasion
for
many
reflections
and
there
happens
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
exactly
such
a
married
pair
as
you
describe
allowing
a
little
for
fancy
and
exaggeration
the
husband
just
as
tall
sturdy
and
heavy
the
wife
so
pretty
and
dainty
that
he
could
easily
hold
her
in
his
hand
their
mutual
position
in
other
respects
their
history
altogether
so
exactly
accords
with
your
tale
that
the
girls
seriously
asked
me
whether
you
knew
the
persons
and
described
them
in
jest
i
assured
them
that
you
did
not
and
you
will
do
well
to
let
the
tale
remain
unwritten
with
the
assistance
of
delays
and
pretexts
we
may
soon
find
an
excuse
i
was
much
astonished
for
i
had
thought
of
no
couple
on
this
or
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
nay
i
could
not
have
stated
how
i
came
by
the
notion
in
thought
i
liked
to
sport
with
such
pleasantries
without
any
particular
reference
and
i
believed
if
i
narrated
them
it
would
be
the
same
with
others
when
i
returned
to
my
occupations
in
the
city
i
felt
them
more
than
usually
wearisome
for
a
man
born
to
activity
forms
plans
too
extensive
for
his
capacity
and
overburdens
himself
with
labour
this
goes
on
very
well
till
some
physical
or
moral
impediment
comes
in
the
way
and
clearly
shows
the
disproportion
of
the
powers
to
the
undertaking
return
to
strasburg
i
pursued
jurisprudence
with
as
much
diligence
as
was
required
to
take
my
degree
with
some
credit
medicine
charmed
me
because
it
showed
nature
if
it
did
not
unfold
it
on
every
side
and
to
this
i
was
attached
by
intercourse
and
habit
to
society
i
was
obliged
to
devote
some
time
and
attention
for
in
many
families
i
had
fallen
in
for
much
both
of
love
and
honour
all
this
might
have
been
carried
on
had
not
that
which
herder
had
inculcated
pressed
upon
me
with
an
infinite
weight
he
had
torn
down
the
curtain
which
concealed
from
me
the
poverty
of
german
literature
he
had
ruthlessly
destroyed
so
many
of
my
prejudices
in
the
sky
of
my
fatherland
there
were
few
stars
of
importance
left
when
he
had
treated
all
the
rest
as
so
many
transient
nay
my
own
hopes
and
fancies
respecting
myself
he
had
so
spoiled
that
i
began
to
doubt
my
own
capabilities
at
the
same
time
however
he
dragged
me
on
to
the
noble
broad
way
which
he
himself
was
inclined
to
tread
drew
my
attention
to
his
favourite
authors
at
the
head
of
whom
stood
swift
and
hamann
and
shook
me
up
with
more
force
than
he
had
bound
me
down
to
this
manifold
confusion
was
now
added
an
incipient
passion
which
while
it
threatened
to
absorb
me
might
indeed
draw
me
from
other
relations
but
could
scarcely
elevate
me
above
them
then
came
besides
a
corporeal
malady
which
made
me
feel
after
dinner
as
if
my
throat
was
closed
up
and
of
which
i
did
not
easily
get
rid
till
afterwards
when
i
abstained
from
a
certain
red
wine
which
i
generally
and
very
willingly
drank
in
the
this
intolerable
inconvenience
had
quitted
me
at
sesenheim
so
that
i
felt
double
pleasure
in
being
there
but
when
i
came
back
to
my
it
returned
to
my
great
annoyance
all
this
made
me
thoughful
and
morose
and
my
outward
appearance
probably
corresponded
with
my
inward
feelings
being
in
a
worse
humour
than
ever
because
the
malady
was
violent
after
dinner
i
attended
the
clinical
lecture
the
great
care
and
cheerfulness
with
which
our
respected
instructor
led
us
from
bed
to
bed
the
minute
observation
of
important
symptoms
the
judgment
of
the
cause
of
complaint
in
general
the
fine
hippocratic
mode
of
proceeding
by
which
without
theory
and
out
of
an
individual
experience
the
forms
of
knowledge
revealed
themselves
the
addresses
with
which
he
usually
crowned
his
lectures
all
this
attracted
me
towards
him
and
made
a
strange
department
into
which
i
only
looked
as
through
a
crevice
so
much
the
more
agreeable
and
fascinating
my
disgust
at
the
invalids
gradually
decreased
as
i
learned
to
change
their
various
states
into
distinct
conceptions
by
which
recovery
and
the
restoration
of
the
human
form
and
nature
appeared
possible
he
probably
had
his
eye
particularly
upon
me
as
a
singular
young
man
and
pardoned
the
strange
anomaly
which
took
me
to
his
lectures
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
conclude
his
lecture
as
usual
with
a
doctrine
which
might
have
reference
to
an
illness
that
had
been
observed
but
said
cheerfully
gentlemen
there
are
some
holidays
before
us
make
use
of
them
to
enliven
your
spirits
studies
must
not
only
be
pursued
with
seriousness
and
diligence
but
also
with
cheerfulness
and
freedom
of
mind
give
movement
to
your
bodies
and
traverse
the
beautiful
country
on
horse
and
foot
he
who
is
at
home
will
take
delight
in
that
to
which
he
has
been
accustomed
while
for
the
stranger
there
will
be
new
impressions
and
pleasant
reminiscences
in
future
there
were
only
two
of
us
to
whom
this
admonition
could
be
directed
may
the
recipe
have
been
as
obvious
to
the
other
as
it
was
to
me
i
thought
i
heard
a
voice
from
heaven
and
made
all
the
haste
i
could
to
order
a
horse
and
dress
myself
out
neatly
i
sent
for
weyland
but
he
was
not
to
be
found
this
did
not
delay
my
resolution
but
the
preparations
unfortunately
went
on
slowly
and
i
could
not
depart
so
soon
as
i
had
hoped
fast
as
i
rode
i
was
overtaken
by
the
night
the
way
was
not
to
be
mistaken
and
the
moon
shed
her
light
on
my
impassioned
project
the
night
was
windy
and
awful
and
i
dashed
on
that
i
might
not
have
to
wait
till
morning
before
i
could
see
her
return
to
sesenheim
it
was
already
late
when
i
put
up
my
horse
at
sesenheim
the
landlord
in
answer
to
my
question
whether
there
was
still
light
in
the
parsonage
assured
me
that
the
ladies
had
only
just
gone
home
he
thought
he
had
heard
they
were
still
expecting
a
stranger
this
did
not
please
me
as
i
wished
to
have
been
the
only
one
i
hastened
that
late
as
i
was
i
might
at
least
appear
the
first
i
found
the
two
sisters
sitting
at
the
door
they
did
not
seem
much
astonished
but
i
was
when
frederica
whispered
into
olivia
ear
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
did
i
not
say
so
here
he
is
they
conducted
me
into
a
room
where
i
found
a
little
collation
set
out
the
mother
greeted
me
as
an
old
acquaintance
and
the
elder
sister
when
she
saw
me
in
the
light
broke
out
into
loud
laughter
for
she
had
little
command
over
herself
after
this
first
and
somewhat
odd
reception
the
conversation
became
at
once
free
and
cheerful
and
a
circumstance
which
had
remained
concealed
from
me
this
evening
i
learned
on
the
following
day
frederica
had
predicted
that
i
should
come
and
who
does
not
feel
some
satisfaction
at
the
fulfilment
of
a
foreboding
even
if
it
be
a
mournful
one
all
presentiments
when
confirmed
by
the
event
give
man
a
higher
opinion
of
himself
whether
it
be
that
he
thinks
himself
in
possession
of
so
fine
a
susceptibility
as
to
feel
a
relation
in
the
distance
or
acute
enough
to
perceive
necessary
but
still
uncertain
associations
even
olivia
laugh
remained
no
secret
she
confessed
that
it
seemed
very
comical
to
see
me
dressed
and
decked
out
on
this
occasion
frederica
on
the
other
hand
found
it
advantageous
not
to
explain
such
a
phenomenon
as
vanity
but
rather
to
discover
in
it
a
wish
to
please
her
early
in
the
morning
frederica
asked
me
to
take
a
walk
her
mother
and
sister
were
occupied
in
preparing
everything
for
the
reception
of
several
guests
by
the
side
of
this
beloved
girl
i
enjoyed
the
noble
sunday
morning
in
the
country
as
the
inestimable
hebel
has
depicted
it
she
described
to
me
the
party
which
was
expected
and
asked
me
to
remain
by
her
that
all
the
pleasure
might
if
possible
be
common
to
us
both
and
be
enjoyed
in
a
certain
order
generally
she
said
people
amuse
themselves
alone
sport
and
play
is
very
lightly
tasted
so
that
at
last
nothing
is
left
but
cards
for
one
part
and
the
excitement
of
dancing
for
the
other
we
therefore
sketched
our
plan
as
to
what
should
be
done
after
dinner
taught
each
other
some
new
social
games
and
were
united
and
happy
when
the
bell
summoned
us
to
church
where
by
her
side
i
found
a
somewhat
dry
sermon
of
her
father
not
too
long
the
presence
of
the
beloved
one
always
shortens
time
but
this
hour
passed
amid
peculiar
reflections
i
repeated
to
myself
the
good
qualities
which
she
had
just
unfolded
so
freely
before
me
her
circumspect
cheerfulness
her
combined
with
her
hilarity
with
foresight
qualities
which
seem
incompatible
but
which
nevertheless
were
found
together
in
her
and
gave
a
pleasing
character
to
her
outward
appearance
but
now
i
had
to
make
more
serious
reflections
upon
myself
which
were
somewhat
prejudicial
to
a
free
state
of
cheerfulness
effect
of
lucinda
curse
since
that
impassioned
girl
had
cursed
and
sanctified
my
lips
for
every
consecration
involves
both
i
had
superstitiously
enough
taken
care
not
to
kiss
any
girl
because
i
feared
that
i
might
injure
her
in
some
spiritual
manner
i
therefore
subdued
every
desire
by
which
a
youth
feels
impelled
to
win
from
a
charming
girl
this
favour
which
says
much
or
little
but
even
in
the
most
decorous
company
a
heavy
trial
awaited
me
those
little
games
as
they
are
called
which
are
more
or
less
ingenious
and
by
which
a
joyous
young
circle
is
collected
and
combined
depend
in
a
great
measure
upon
forfeits
in
the
calling
in
of
which
kisses
have
no
small
value
i
had
resolved
once
for
all
not
to
kiss
and
as
every
want
or
impediment
stimulates
us
to
an
activity
to
which
we
should
otherwise
not
feel
inclined
i
exerted
all
the
talent
and
humour
i
possessed
to
help
myself
through
and
thus
to
win
rather
than
lose
before
the
company
and
for
the
company
when
a
verse
was
desired
for
the
redemption
of
a
forfeit
the
demand
was
usually
directed
to
me
now
i
was
always
prepared
and
on
such
occasions
contrived
to
bring
out
something
in
praise
of
the
hostess
or
of
some
lady
who
had
conducted
herself
most
agreeably
towards
me
if
it
happened
that
a
kiss
was
imposed
upon
me
at
all
events
i
endeavoured
to
escape
by
some
turn
which
was
considered
satisfactory
and
as
i
had
time
to
reflect
on
the
matter
beforehand
i
was
never
in
want
of
various
elegant
excuses
although
those
made
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
were
always
most
successful
when
we
reached
home
the
guests
who
had
arrived
from
several
quarters
were
buzzing
merrily
one
with
another
until
frederica
collected
them
together
and
invited
and
conducted
them
to
a
walk
to
that
charming
spot
there
they
found
an
abundant
collation
and
wished
to
fill
up
with
social
games
the
period
before
dinner
here
by
agreement
with
frederica
though
she
did
not
know
my
secret
i
contrived
to
get
up
and
go
through
games
without
forfeits
and
redemptions
of
forfeits
without
kissing
my
skill
and
readiness
were
so
much
the
more
necessary
as
the
company
which
was
otherwise
quite
strange
to
me
seemed
to
have
suspected
some
connexion
between
me
and
the
dear
girl
and
roguishly
took
the
greatest
pains
to
force
upon
me
that
which
i
secretly
endeavoured
to
avoid
for
in
such
circles
if
people
perceive
a
growing
inclination
between
two
young
persons
they
try
to
make
them
confused
or
to
bring
them
closer
together
just
as
afterwards
when
once
a
passion
has
been
declared
they
take
trouble
on
purpose
to
part
them
again
thus
to
the
man
of
society
it
is
totally
indifferent
whether
he
confers
a
benefit
or
an
injury
provided
only
he
is
amused
this
morning
i
could
observe
with
more
attention
the
whole
character
of
frederica
so
that
for
the
whole
time
she
always
remained
to
me
the
same
the
friendly
greetings
of
the
peasants
which
were
especially
addressed
to
her
gave
me
to
understand
that
she
was
beneficent
to
them
and
created
in
them
an
agreeable
feeling
the
elder
sister
remained
at
home
with
her
mother
nothing
that
demanded
bodily
exertion
was
required
of
frederica
but
she
was
spared
they
said
on
account
of
her
chest
there
are
women
who
especially
please
us
in
a
room
others
who
look
better
in
the
open
air
frederica
belonged
to
the
latter
her
whole
nature
her
form
never
appeared
more
charming
than
when
she
moved
along
an
elevated
footpath
the
grace
of
her
deportment
seemed
to
vie
with
the
flowery
earth
and
the
indestructible
cheerfulness
of
her
countenance
with
the
blue
sky
this
refreshing
atmosphere
which
surrounded
her
she
carried
home
and
it
might
soon
be
perceived
that
she
understood
how
to
reconcile
difficulties
and
to
obliterate
with
ease
the
impression
made
by
little
unpleasant
contingencies
the
purest
joy
which
we
can
feel
with
respect
to
a
beloved
person
is
to
find
that
she
pleases
others
frederica
conduct
in
society
was
beneficent
to
all
in
walks
she
floated
about
an
animating
spirit
and
knew
how
to
supply
the
gaps
which
might
arise
here
and
there
the
lightness
of
her
movements
we
have
already
commended
and
she
was
most
graceful
when
she
ran
as
the
deer
seems
just
to
fulfil
its
destination
when
it
lightly
flies
over
the
sprouting
so
did
her
peculiar
nature
seem
most
plainly
to
express
itself
when
she
ran
with
light
steps
over
mead
and
furrow
to
fetch
something
which
had
been
forgotten
to
seek
something
which
had
been
lost
to
summon
a
distant
couple
or
to
order
something
necessary
on
these
occasions
she
was
never
out
of
breath
and
always
kept
her
equilibrium
hence
the
great
anxiety
of
her
parents
with
respect
to
her
chest
must
to
many
have
appeared
excessive
the
father
who
often
accompanied
us
through
meadows
and
fields
was
not
always
provided
with
a
suitable
companion
on
this
account
i
joined
him
and
he
did
not
fail
to
touch
once
more
upon
his
favourite
theme
and
circumstantially
to
tell
me
about
the
proposed
building
of
the
parsonage
he
particularly
regretted
that
he
could
not
again
get
the
carefully
finished
sketches
so
as
to
meditate
upon
them
and
to
consider
this
or
that
improvement
i
observed
that
the
loss
might
be
easily
supplied
and
offered
to
prepare
a
upon
which
after
all
everything
chiefly
depended
with
this
he
was
highly
pleased
and
settled
that
we
should
have
the
assistance
of
the
schoolmaster
to
stir
up
whom
he
at
once
hurried
off
that
the
yard
and
might
be
ready
early
on
the
morrow
when
he
had
gone
frederica
said
you
are
right
to
humour
my
dear
father
on
his
weak
side
and
not
like
others
who
get
weary
of
this
subject
to
avoid
him
or
to
break
it
off
i
must
indeed
confess
to
you
that
the
rest
of
us
do
not
desire
this
building
it
would
be
too
expensive
for
the
congregation
and
for
us
also
a
new
house
new
furniture
our
guests
would
not
feel
more
comfortable
with
us
now
they
are
once
accustomed
to
the
old
building
here
we
can
treat
them
liberally
there
we
should
find
ourselves
straightened
in
a
wider
sphere
thus
the
matter
stands
but
do
not
you
fail
to
be
agreeable
i
thank
you
for
it
from
my
heart
another
lady
who
joined
us
asked
about
some
novels
whether
frederica
had
read
them
she
answered
in
the
negative
for
she
had
read
but
little
altogether
she
had
grown
up
in
a
cheerful
decorous
enjoyment
of
life
and
was
cultivated
accordingly
i
had
the
of
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
but
did
not
venture
to
propose
it
the
similarity
of
the
situations
being
too
striking
and
too
important
i
am
very
fond
of
reading
novels
she
said
one
finds
in
them
such
nice
people
whom
one
would
like
to
resemble
plan
for
the
new
parsonage
the
measurement
of
the
house
took
place
the
following
day
it
was
a
somewhat
slow
proceeding
as
i
was
as
little
accustomed
to
such
arts
as
the
schoolmaster
at
last
a
tolerable
project
came
to
my
aid
the
good
father
told
me
his
views
and
was
not
displeased
when
i
asked
permission
to
prepare
the
plan
more
conveniently
in
the
town
frederica
dismissed
me
with
joy
she
was
convinced
of
my
affection
and
i
of
hers
and
the
six
leagues
no
longer
appeared
a
distance
it
was
so
easy
to
travel
to
drusenheim
in
the
diligence
and
by
this
vehicle
as
well
as
by
messengers
ordinary
and
extraordinary
to
keep
up
a
connexion
george
being
entrusted
with
the
despatches
when
i
had
arrived
in
the
town
i
occupied
myself
in
the
earliest
hours
for
there
was
no
notion
of
a
long
sleep
with
the
plan
which
i
drew
as
neatly
as
possible
in
the
meanwhile
i
had
sent
frederica
some
books
accompanied
by
a
few
kind
words
i
received
an
answer
at
once
and
was
charmed
with
her
light
pretty
hearty
hand
contents
and
style
were
natural
good
amiable
as
if
they
came
from
within
and
thus
the
pleasing
impression
she
had
made
upon
me
was
ever
kept
up
and
renewed
i
but
too
readily
recalled
to
myself
the
endowments
of
her
beautiful
nature
and
nurtured
the
hope
that
i
should
see
her
soon
and
for
a
longer
time
there
was
now
no
more
any
need
of
an
address
from
our
good
instructor
he
had
by
those
words
spoken
at
the
right
time
so
completely
cured
me
that
i
had
no
particular
inclination
to
see
him
and
his
patients
again
the
correspondence
with
frederica
became
more
animated
she
invited
me
to
a
festival
to
which
also
some
friends
from
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
would
come
i
was
to
make
arrangements
for
a
longer
time
this
i
did
by
packing
a
stout
portmanteau
upon
the
diligence
and
in
a
few
hours
i
was
in
her
presence
i
found
a
large
merry
party
took
the
father
aside
and
handed
him
the
plan
at
which
he
testified
great
delight
i
talked
over
with
him
what
i
had
thought
while
completing
it
he
was
quite
beside
himself
with
joy
and
especially
praised
the
neatness
of
the
drawing
this
i
had
practised
from
my
youth
upwards
and
had
on
this
occasion
taken
especial
pains
with
the
finest
paper
but
this
pleasure
was
very
soon
marred
for
our
good
host
when
against
my
counsel
and
in
the
joy
of
his
heart
he
laid
the
sketch
before
the
company
far
from
uttering
the
desired
sympathy
some
thought
nothing
at
all
of
this
precious
work
others
who
thought
they
knew
something
of
the
matter
made
it
still
worse
blaming
the
sketch
as
not
artistical
and
when
the
old
man
looked
off
for
a
moment
handled
the
clean
sheets
as
if
they
were
only
so
many
rough
draughts
while
one
with
the
hard
strokes
of
a
marked
his
plans
of
improvement
on
the
fine
paper
in
such
a
manner
that
a
restoration
of
the
primitive
purity
was
not
to
be
thought
of
i
was
scarcely
able
to
console
the
extremely
irritated
man
whose
pleasures
had
been
so
outrageously
destroyed
much
as
i
assured
him
that
i
myself
looked
upon
them
only
as
sketches
which
we
would
talk
over
and
on
which
we
would
construct
new
drawings
in
spite
of
all
this
he
went
off
in
a
very
and
frederica
thanked
me
for
my
attention
to
her
father
as
well
as
for
my
patience
during
the
unmannerly
conduct
of
the
other
guests
festival
at
the
parsonage
but
i
could
feel
no
pain
nor
in
her
presence
the
party
consisted
of
young
and
tolerably
noisy
friends
whom
nevertheless
an
old
gentleman
tried
to
outdo
proposing
even
odder
stuff
than
they
practised
already
at
breakfast
the
wine
had
not
been
spared
at
a
very
there
was
no
want
of
any
enjoyment
and
the
feast
was
relished
the
more
by
everybody
after
the
violent
bodily
exercise
during
the
somewhat
warm
weather
and
if
the
official
gentleman
went
a
little
too
far
in
the
good
things
the
young
people
were
not
left
much
behind
him
i
was
happy
beyond
all
bounds
at
the
side
of
frederica
talkative
merry
ingenious
forward
and
yet
kept
in
moderation
by
feeling
esteem
and
attachment
she
in
a
similar
position
was
open
cheerful
sympathizing
and
communicative
we
all
appeared
to
live
for
the
company
and
yet
lived
only
for
each
other
after
the
meal
they
sought
the
shade
social
games
were
begun
and
the
turn
came
to
forfeits
on
redeeming
the
forfeits
everything
of
every
kind
was
carried
to
excess
the
gestures
which
were
commanded
the
acts
which
were
to
be
done
the
problems
which
were
to
be
solved
all
showed
a
mad
joy
which
knew
no
limits
i
myself
heightened
these
wild
jokes
by
many
a
comical
prank
and
frederica
shone
by
many
a
droll
thought
she
appeared
to
me
more
charming
than
ever
all
hypochondriacal
superstitious
fancies
had
vanished
and
when
the
opportunity
offered
of
heartily
kissing
one
whom
i
loved
so
tenderly
i
did
not
miss
it
still
less
did
i
deny
myself
a
repetition
of
this
pleasure
the
hope
of
the
party
for
music
was
at
last
satisfied
it
was
heard
and
all
hastened
to
the
dance
waltzing
and
turning
were
beginning
middle
and
end
all
had
given
up
to
this
national
dance
even
i
did
honour
enough
to
my
private
and
frederica
who
danced
as
she
walked
sprang
and
ran
was
delighted
to
find
in
me
a
very
expert
partner
we
generally
kept
together
but
were
soon
obliged
to
leave
off
and
she
was
advised
on
all
sides
not
to
go
on
any
further
in
this
wild
manner
we
consoled
ourselves
by
a
solitary
walk
hand
in
hand
and
when
we
had
reached
that
quiet
spot
by
the
warmest
embrace
and
the
most
faithful
assurance
that
we
loved
each
other
heartily
older
persons
who
had
risen
with
us
from
the
game
took
us
with
them
at
supper
people
did
not
return
to
their
sober
senses
dancing
went
on
far
into
the
night
and
there
was
as
little
want
of
healths
and
other
incitements
to
drinking
as
at
noon
i
had
scarcely
for
a
few
hours
slept
very
profoundly
when
i
was
awakened
by
a
heat
and
tumult
in
my
blood
it
is
at
such
times
and
in
such
situations
that
care
and
repentance
usually
attack
man
who
is
stretched
out
defenceless
my
imagination
at
once
presented
to
me
the
liveliest
forms
i
saw
lucinda
how
after
the
most
ardent
kiss
she
passionately
receded
from
me
and
with
glowing
cheek
and
sparkling
eyes
uttered
that
curse
by
which
she
intended
to
menace
her
sister
only
but
by
which
she
also
unconsciously
menaced
innocent
persons
who
were
unknown
to
her
i
saw
frederica
standing
opposite
to
her
paralysed
at
the
sight
pale
and
feeling
the
consequences
of
the
curse
of
which
she
knew
nothing
i
found
myself
between
them
as
little
able
to
ward
off
the
spiritual
effects
of
the
adventure
as
to
avoid
the
kiss
the
delicate
health
of
frederica
seemed
to
hasten
the
threatened
calamity
and
now
her
love
to
mo
wore
a
most
unhappy
aspect
and
i
wished
myself
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
but
something
still
more
painful
to
me
which
lay
in
the
background
i
will
not
conceal
a
certain
conceit
kept
that
superstition
alive
in
me
my
lips
whether
consecrated
or
cursed
appeared
to
me
more
important
than
usual
and
with
no
little
complacency
was
i
aware
of
my
conduct
in
renouncing
many
an
innocent
pleasure
partly
to
preserve
my
magical
advantage
partly
to
avoid
injuring
a
harmless
being
by
giving
it
up
but
now
all
was
lost
and
irrevocable
i
had
returned
into
a
mere
common
position
and
i
thought
that
i
had
harmed
irretrievably
injured
the
dearest
of
beings
thus
far
from
my
being
freed
from
the
curse
it
was
flung
back
from
my
lips
into
my
own
heart
all
this
together
raged
in
my
blood
already
excited
by
love
and
passion
wine
and
dancing
confused
my
thoughts
and
tortured
my
feelings
so
that
especially
as
contrasted
with
the
joys
of
the
day
before
i
felt
myself
in
a
state
of
despair
which
seemed
unbounded
fortunately
daylight
peered
in
upon
me
through
a
chink
in
the
shutter
and
the
sun
stepping
forth
and
vanquishing
all
the
powers
of
night
set
me
again
upon
my
feet
i
was
soon
in
the
open
air
and
refreshed
if
not
restored
correspondence
with
frederica
superstition
like
many
other
fancies
very
easily
loses
in
power
when
instead
of
flattering
our
vanity
it
stands
in
its
way
and
would
fain
produce
an
evil
hour
to
this
delicate
being
we
then
see
well
enough
that
we
can
get
rid
of
it
when
we
choose
we
renounce
it
the
more
easily
as
all
of
which
we
deprive
ourselves
turns
to
our
own
advantage
the
sight
of
frederica
the
feeling
of
her
love
the
cheerfulness
of
everything
around
me
all
reproved
me
that
in
the
midst
of
the
happiest
days
i
could
harbour
such
dismal
in
my
bosom
the
confiding
conduct
of
the
dear
girl
which
became
more
and
more
intimate
made
me
thoroughly
rejoiced
and
i
felt
truly
happy
when
at
parting
she
openly
gave
a
kiss
to
me
as
well
as
the
other
friends
and
relations
in
the
city
many
occupations
and
dissipations
awaited
me
from
the
midst
of
which
i
collected
myself
for
the
sake
of
my
beloved
by
means
of
a
correspondence
which
we
regularly
established
even
in
her
letters
she
always
remained
the
same
whether
she
related
anything
new
or
alluded
to
occurrences
lightly
described
or
cursorily
reflected
it
was
always
as
if
even
with
her
pen
she
appeared
going
coming
running
bounding
with
a
step
as
light
as
it
was
sure
i
also
liked
very
much
to
write
to
her
for
the
act
of
rendering
present
her
good
qualities
increased
my
affection
even
during
absence
so
that
this
intercourse
was
little
inferior
to
a
personal
one
nay
afterwards
became
pleasanter
and
dearer
to
me
for
that
superstition
had
been
forced
to
give
way
altogether
it
was
indeed
based
upon
the
impressions
of
earlier
years
but
the
spirit
of
the
day
the
liveliness
of
youth
the
intercourse
with
cold
sensible
men
all
was
unfavourable
to
it
so
that
it
would
not
have
been
easy
to
find
among
all
who
surrounded
me
a
single
person
to
whom
a
confession
of
my
whims
would
not
have
been
perfectly
ridiculous
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
the
fancy
while
it
fled
left
behind
it
a
real
contemplation
of
that
state
in
which
young
people
are
placed
whose
early
affections
can
promise
themselves
no
lasting
result
so
little
was
i
assisted
in
getting
free
from
error
that
understanding
and
reflection
used
me
still
worse
in
this
instance
my
passion
increased
the
more
i
learned
to
know
the
virtue
of
the
excellent
girl
and
the
time
approached
when
i
was
to
lose
perhaps
for
ever
so
much
that
was
dear
and
good
we
had
quietly
and
pleasantly
passed
a
long
time
together
when
friend
weyland
had
the
waggery
to
bring
with
him
to
sesenheim
the
of
and
when
they
were
talking
of
reading
aloud
to
hand
it
over
to
me
unexpectedly
as
if
nothing
further
was
to
be
said
i
managed
to
collect
myself
and
read
with
as
much
cheerfulness
and
freedom
as
i
could
even
the
faces
of
my
hearers
at
once
brightened
and
it
did
not
seem
unpleasant
to
them
to
be
again
forced
to
a
comparison
if
they
had
found
comical
counterparts
to
raymond
and
melusina
they
here
saw
themselves
in
a
glass
which
by
no
means
gave
a
distorted
likeness
they
did
not
openly
confess
but
they
did
not
deny
that
they
were
moving
among
persons
akin
both
by
mind
and
feeling
all
men
of
a
good
disposition
feel
with
increasing
cultivation
that
they
have
a
double
part
to
play
in
the
world
a
real
one
and
an
ideal
one
and
in
this
feeling
is
the
ground
of
everything
noble
to
be
sought
the
real
part
which
has
been
assigned
to
us
we
experience
but
too
plainly
with
respect
to
the
second
we
seldom
come
to
a
clear
understanding
about
it
man
may
seek
his
higher
destination
on
earth
or
in
heaven
in
the
present
or
in
the
future
he
yet
remains
on
this
account
exposed
to
an
eternal
wavering
to
an
influence
from
without
which
ever
disturbs
him
until
he
once
for
all
makes
a
resolution
to
declare
that
that
is
right
which
is
suitable
to
himself
among
the
most
venial
attempts
to
acquire
something
higher
to
place
oneself
on
an
equality
with
something
higher
may
be
classed
the
youthful
impulse
to
compare
oneself
with
the
characters
in
novels
this
is
highly
innocent
and
whatever
may
be
urged
against
it
the
very
reverse
of
mischievous
it
amuses
at
times
when
we
should
necessarily
die
of
or
grasp
at
the
recreation
of
passion
how
often
is
repeated
the
litany
about
the
mischief
of
novels
and
yet
what
misfortune
is
it
if
a
pretty
girl
or
a
handsome
young
man
put
themselves
in
the
place
of
a
person
who
fares
better
or
worse
than
themselves
is
the
citizen
life
worth
so
much
or
do
the
necessities
of
the
day
so
completely
absorb
the
man
that
he
must
refuse
every
beautiful
demand
which
is
made
upon
him
results
of
the
christian
names
which
have
intruded
into
the
german
church
in
the
place
of
the
sacred
names
not
unfrequently
to
the
annoyance
of
the
officiating
clergyman
are
without
doubt
to
be
regarded
as
small
ramifications
of
the
pictures
this
very
impulse
to
honour
one
child
by
a
name
even
if
the
name
has
nothing
further
behind
it
is
praiseworthy
and
this
connexion
of
an
imaginary
world
with
the
real
one
diffuses
an
agreeable
lustre
over
the
whole
life
of
the
person
a
beautiful
child
whom
with
satisfaction
we
call
bertha
we
should
think
we
offended
if
we
were
to
call
it
urselblandine
with
a
cultivated
man
not
to
say
a
lover
such
a
name
would
certainly
falter
on
the
lips
the
cold
world
which
judges
only
from
one
side
is
not
to
be
blamed
if
it
sets
down
as
ridiculous
and
objectionable
all
that
comes
forward
as
imaginary
but
the
thinking
connoisseur
of
mankind
must
know
how
to
estimate
it
according
to
its
worth
for
the
position
of
the
loving
couple
on
the
fair
this
comparison
to
which
a
wag
had
compelled
them
produced
the
most
agreeable
results
we
do
not
think
of
ourselves
when
we
look
in
a
mirror
but
we
feel
ourselves
and
allow
ourselves
to
pass
thus
is
it
also
with
those
moral
imitations
in
which
we
recognise
our
manners
and
inclinations
our
habits
and
peculiarities
as
in
a
and
strive
to
grasp
it
and
embrace
it
with
brotherly
affection
the
habit
of
being
together
became
more
and
more
confirmed
and
nothing
else
was
known
but
that
i
belonged
to
this
circle
the
affair
was
allowed
to
take
its
course
without
the
question
being
directly
asked
as
to
what
was
to
be
the
result
and
what
parents
are
there
who
do
not
find
themselves
compelled
to
let
daughters
and
sons
continue
for
a
while
in
such
a
wavering
condition
until
accidentally
something
is
confirmed
for
life
better
than
it
could
have
been
produced
by
a
long
arranged
plan
it
was
thought
that
perfect
confidence
could
be
placed
both
in
frederica
sentiments
and
in
my
rectitude
of
which
on
account
of
my
forbearance
even
from
innocent
caresses
a
favourable
opinion
had
been
entertained
we
were
left
unobserved
as
was
generally
the
custom
there
and
then
and
it
depended
on
ourselves
to
go
over
the
country
with
a
larger
or
smaller
party
and
to
visit
the
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
on
both
sides
of
the
rhine
in
hagenau
philippsburg
the
ortenau
i
found
dispersed
those
persons
whom
i
had
seen
united
at
sesenheim
every
one
by
himself
a
friendly
hospitable
host
throwing
open
kitchen
and
cellar
just
as
willingly
as
gardens
and
vineyards
nay
the
whole
spot
the
islands
on
the
rhine
were
often
a
goal
for
our
there
without
pity
we
put
the
cool
inhabitants
of
the
clear
rhine
into
the
kettle
on
the
spit
into
the
boiling
fat
and
would
here
perhaps
more
than
was
reasonable
have
settled
ourselves
in
the
snug
fishermen
huts
if
the
abominable
had
not
after
some
hours
driven
us
away
at
this
intolerable
interruption
of
one
of
our
most
charming
parties
of
pleasure
when
everything
else
was
prosperous
when
the
affection
of
the
lovers
seemed
to
increase
with
the
good
success
of
the
enterprise
and
we
had
nevertheless
come
home
too
soon
unsuitably
and
inopportunely
i
actually
in
the
presence
of
the
good
reverend
father
broke
out
into
blasphemous
expressions
and
assured
him
that
these
gnats
alone
were
sufficient
to
remove
from
me
the
thought
that
a
good
and
wise
deity
had
created
the
world
the
pious
old
gentleman
by
way
of
reply
solemnly
called
me
to
order
and
explained
to
me
that
these
gnats
and
other
vermin
had
not
arisen
until
after
the
fall
of
our
first
parents
or
that
if
there
were
any
of
them
in
paradise
they
had
only
pleasantly
hummed
there
and
had
not
stung
i
certainly
felt
myself
calmed
at
once
for
an
angry
man
may
easily
be
appeased
if
we
can
succeed
in
making
him
smile
but
i
nevertheless
asserted
that
there
was
no
need
of
the
angel
with
the
burning
sword
to
drive
the
guilty
pair
out
of
the
garden
my
host
i
said
must
rather
allow
me
to
think
that
this
was
effected
by
means
of
great
gnats
on
the
tigris
and
the
euphrates
and
thus
i
again
made
him
laugh
for
the
old
man
understood
a
joke
or
at
any
rate
let
one
pass
the
pastor
chair
however
the
enjoyment
of
the
and
season
in
this
noble
country
was
more
serious
and
more
elevating
to
the
heart
one
had
only
to
resign
oneself
to
the
present
to
enjoy
the
clearness
of
the
pure
sky
the
brilliancy
of
the
rich
earth
the
mild
evenings
the
warm
nights
by
the
side
of
a
beloved
one
or
in
her
vicinity
for
months
together
we
were
favoured
with
pure
ethereal
mornings
when
the
sky
displayed
itself
in
all
its
magnificence
having
watered
the
earth
with
superfluous
dew
and
that
this
spectacle
might
not
become
too
simple
clouds
after
clouds
piled
themselves
over
the
distant
mountains
now
in
this
spot
now
in
that
they
stood
for
days
nay
for
weeks
without
obscuring
the
pure
sky
and
even
the
transient
storms
refreshed
the
country
and
gave
lustre
to
the
green
which
again
glistened
in
the
sunshine
before
it
could
become
dry
the
double
rainbow
the
borders
of
a
dark
grey
and
nearly
black
streak
in
the
sky
were
nobler
more
highly
coloured
more
decided
but
also
more
transient
than
i
had
ever
observed
in
the
midst
of
these
objects
the
desire
of
poetising
which
i
had
not
felt
for
a
long
time
again
came
forward
for
frederica
i
composed
many
songs
to
melodies
they
would
have
made
a
pretty
little
book
a
few
of
them
still
remain
and
will
easily
be
found
among
my
others
since
on
account
of
my
strange
studies
and
other
circumstances
i
was
often
compelled
to
return
to
the
town
there
arose
for
our
affection
a
new
life
which
preserved
us
from
all
that
unpleasantness
which
usually
attaches
itself
as
an
annoying
consequence
to
such
little
though
far
from
me
she
yet
laboured
for
me
and
thought
of
some
new
amusement
against
i
should
return
though
far
from
her
i
employed
myself
for
her
that
by
some
new
gift
or
new
notion
i
myself
might
be
again
new
to
her
painted
ribbons
had
then
just
come
into
fashion
i
painted
at
once
for
her
a
few
pieces
and
sent
them
on
with
a
little
poem
as
on
this
occasion
i
was
forced
to
stop
away
longer
than
i
had
anticipated
that
i
might
fulfil
and
even
go
beyond
my
promise
to
the
father
of
a
new
and
elaborated
plan
i
persuaded
a
young
adept
in
architecture
to
work
instead
of
myself
he
took
as
much
pleasure
in
the
task
as
he
had
kindness
for
me
and
was
still
further
animated
by
the
hope
of
a
good
reception
in
so
agreeable
a
family
he
finished
the
sketch
and
section
of
the
house
and
garden
were
not
forgotten
and
a
detailed
but
very
moderate
estimate
was
added
to
show
the
possibility
of
carrying
out
an
extensive
project
these
testimonials
of
our
friendly
endeavours
obtained
for
us
the
kindest
reception
and
since
the
good
father
saw
that
we
had
the
best
will
to
serve
him
he
came
forward
with
one
wish
more
it
was
the
wish
to
see
his
pretty
but
chair
adorned
with
flowers
and
other
ornaments
we
showed
ourselves
accommodating
colours
pencils
and
other
requisites
were
fetched
from
the
tradesmen
and
apothecaries
of
the
nearest
towns
but
that
we
might
not
be
wanting
in
a
mistake
we
did
not
remark
until
all
had
been
most
industriously
and
variously
painted
that
we
had
taken
a
false
varnish
which
would
not
dry
neither
sunshine
nor
draught
neither
fair
nor
wet
weather
were
of
any
avail
in
the
meanwhile
we
were
obliged
to
make
use
of
an
old
and
nothing
was
left
us
but
to
rub
out
the
ornaments
with
more
assiduity
than
we
had
painted
them
the
unpleasantness
of
this
work
was
still
increased
when
the
girls
intreated
us
for
sake
to
proceed
slowly
and
cautiously
for
the
sake
of
sparing
the
ground
which
however
after
this
operation
was
not
again
to
be
restored
to
its
former
brilliancy
by
such
little
disagreeable
contigencies
which
happened
at
intervals
we
were
however
just
as
little
interrupted
in
our
cheerful
life
as
primrose
and
his
amiable
family
for
many
an
unexpected
pleasure
befell
both
ourselves
and
our
friends
and
neighbours
weddings
and
christenings
the
erection
of
a
building
an
inheritance
a
prize
in
the
lottery
were
reciprocally
announced
and
enjoyed
we
shared
all
joy
together
like
a
common
property
and
wished
to
heighten
it
by
mind
and
love
it
was
not
the
first
nor
the
last
time
that
i
found
myself
in
families
and
social
circles
at
the
very
moment
of
their
highest
bloom
and
if
i
may
flatter
myself
that
i
contributed
something
towards
the
lustre
of
such
epochs
i
must
on
the
other
hand
be
reproached
with
the
fact
that
on
this
very
account
such
times
passed
the
more
quickly
and
vanished
the
sooner
the
visit
to
strasburg
but
now
our
love
was
to
undergo
a
singular
trial
i
will
call
it
a
trial
although
this
is
not
the
right
word
the
country
family
with
which
i
was
intimate
was
related
to
some
families
in
the
city
of
good
note
and
respectability
and
comfortably
off
as
to
circumstances
the
young
were
often
at
sesenheim
the
older
persons
the
mothers
and
aunts
being
less
moveable
heard
so
much
of
the
life
there
of
the
increasing
charms
of
the
daughters
and
even
of
my
influence
that
they
first
wished
to
become
acquainted
with
me
and
after
i
had
often
visited
them
and
had
been
well
received
by
them
desired
also
to
see
us
once
altogether
especially
as
they
thought
they
owed
the
sesenheim
folks
a
friendly
reception
in
return
there
was
much
discussion
on
all
sides
the
mother
could
scarcely
leave
her
household
affairs
olivia
had
a
horror
of
the
town
for
which
she
was
not
fitted
and
frederica
had
no
inclination
for
it
and
thus
the
affair
was
put
off
until
it
was
at
last
brought
to
a
decision
by
the
fact
that
it
happened
to
be
impossible
for
me
to
come
into
the
country
for
it
was
better
to
see
each
other
in
the
city
and
under
some
restraint
than
not
to
see
each
other
at
all
and
thus
i
now
found
my
fair
friends
whom
i
had
been
only
accustomed
to
see
in
a
rural
scene
and
whose
image
had
only
appeared
to
me
hitherto
before
a
background
of
waving
boughs
flowing
brooks
nodding
and
a
horizon
open
for
miles
i
now
saw
them
i
say
for
the
first
time
in
which
were
indeed
spacious
but
yet
narrow
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
carpets
glasses
clocks
and
porcelain
figures
the
relation
to
that
which
one
loves
is
so
decided
that
the
surrounding
objects
have
little
to
do
with
it
but
nevertheless
the
heart
desires
that
these
shall
be
the
suitable
natural
and
usual
objects
with
my
lively
feeling
for
everything
present
i
could
not
at
once
adapt
myself
to
the
contradiction
of
the
moment
the
respectable
and
calmly
noble
demeanour
of
the
mother
was
perfectly
adapted
to
the
circle
she
was
not
different
from
the
other
ladies
olivia
on
the
other
hand
showed
herself
as
impatient
as
a
fish
out
of
water
as
she
had
formerly
called
to
me
in
the
gardens
or
beckoned
me
aside
in
the
fields
if
she
had
anything
particular
to
say
to
me
she
also
did
the
same
here
when
she
drew
me
into
the
recess
of
a
window
this
she
did
awkwardly
and
with
embarrassment
because
she
felt
that
it
was
not
becoming
and
did
it
notwithstanding
she
had
the
most
unimportant
things
in
the
world
to
say
to
me
nothing
but
what
i
knew
already
for
instance
that
she
wished
herself
by
the
rhine
over
the
rhine
or
even
in
turkey
frederica
on
the
contrary
was
highly
remarkable
in
this
situation
properly
speaking
she
also
did
not
suit
it
but
it
bore
witness
to
her
character
that
instead
of
finding
herself
adapted
to
this
condition
she
unconsciously
moulded
the
condition
according
to
herself
she
acted
here
as
she
had
acted
with
the
society
in
the
country
she
knew
how
to
animate
every
moment
without
creating
any
disturbance
she
put
all
in
motion
and
exactly
by
this
pacified
society
which
really
is
only
disturbed
by
she
thus
completely
fulfilled
the
desire
of
her
town
aunts
who
wished
for
once
on
their
sofas
to
be
witnesses
of
those
rural
games
and
amusements
if
this
was
done
to
satisfaction
so
also
were
the
wardrobe
the
ornaments
and
whatever
besides
distinguished
the
town
nieces
who
were
dressed
in
the
french
fashion
considered
and
admired
without
envy
with
me
also
frederica
had
no
difficulty
since
she
treated
me
the
same
as
ever
she
seemed
to
give
me
no
other
preference
but
that
of
communicating
her
desires
and
wishes
to
me
rather
than
to
another
and
thus
recognising
me
as
her
servant
to
this
service
she
confidently
laid
claim
on
one
of
the
following
days
when
she
privately
told
me
that
the
ladies
wished
to
hear
me
read
the
daughters
of
the
house
had
spoken
much
on
this
subject
for
at
sesenheim
i
had
read
what
and
when
i
was
desired
i
was
ready
at
once
but
craved
quiet
and
attention
for
several
hours
this
was
conceded
and
one
evening
i
read
through
the
whole
of
without
interruption
entering
into
the
sense
of
the
piece
as
well
as
i
was
able
and
expressing
myself
with
liveliness
and
passion
as
is
possible
in
youth
i
earned
great
applause
frederica
drew
her
breath
deeply
from
time
to
time
and
a
transient
red
had
passed
over
her
cheeks
these
two
symptoms
of
a
tender
heart
internally
moved
while
cheerfulness
and
calmness
were
externally
apparent
were
not
unknown
to
me
and
were
indeed
the
only
reward
which
i
had
striven
to
obtain
she
joyfully
collected
the
thanks
of
the
party
for
having
caused
me
to
read
and
in
her
graceful
manner
did
not
deny
herself
the
little
pride
at
having
shone
in
me
and
through
me
this
town
visit
was
not
to
have
lasted
long
but
the
departure
was
delayed
frederica
did
her
part
for
the
social
amusement
and
i
was
not
wanting
but
the
abundant
sources
which
yield
so
much
in
the
country
now
dried
up
in
their
turn
and
the
situation
was
the
more
painful
as
the
elder
sister
gradually
lost
all
the
two
sisters
were
the
only
persons
in
the
society
who
dressed
themselves
in
the
german
fashion
frederica
had
never
thought
of
herself
in
any
other
way
and
believed
herself
so
right
everywhere
that
she
made
no
comparisons
with
any
one
else
but
olivia
found
it
quite
insupportable
to
move
about
in
a
society
of
genteel
appearance
attired
so
like
a
in
the
country
she
scarcely
remarked
the
town
costume
of
others
and
did
not
desire
it
but
in
the
town
she
could
not
endure
the
country
style
all
this
together
with
the
different
lot
of
town
ladies
and
the
thousand
trifles
of
a
series
of
circumstances
totally
opposed
to
her
own
notions
so
worked
for
some
days
in
her
impassioned
bosom
that
i
was
forced
to
apply
all
my
flattering
attention
to
appease
her
according
to
the
wish
of
frederica
i
feared
an
impassioned
scene
i
looked
forward
to
the
moment
when
she
would
throw
herself
at
my
feet
and
implore
me
by
all
that
was
sacred
to
rescue
her
from
this
situation
she
was
good
to
a
heavenly
degree
if
she
could
conduct
herself
in
her
own
way
but
such
a
restraint
at
once
made
her
uncomfortable
and
could
at
last
drive
her
even
to
despair
i
now
sought
to
hasten
that
which
was
desired
by
the
mother
and
olivia
and
not
repugnant
to
frederica
i
did
not
refrain
from
praising
her
as
a
contrast
to
her
sister
i
told
her
what
pleasure
it
gave
me
to
find
her
unaltered
and
even
under
the
present
circumstances
just
as
free
as
the
bird
among
the
branches
she
was
courteous
enough
to
reply
that
i
was
there
and
that
she
wished
to
go
neither
in
nor
out
when
i
was
with
her
at
last
i
saw
them
take
their
departure
and
it
seemed
as
though
a
stone
fell
from
my
heart
for
my
own
feelings
had
shared
the
condition
of
frederica
and
olivia
i
was
not
passionately
tormented
like
the
latter
but
i
felt
by
no
means
as
comfortable
as
the
former
the
disputation
since
i
had
properly
gone
to
strasburg
to
take
my
degree
it
may
be
rightly
reckoned
among
the
irregularities
of
my
life
that
i
treated
this
material
business
as
a
mere
collateral
affair
all
anxiety
as
to
my
examination
i
had
put
aside
in
a
very
easy
fashion
but
i
had
now
to
think
of
the
for
on
my
departure
from
frankfort
i
had
promised
my
father
and
resolved
within
myself
to
write
one
it
is
the
fault
of
those
who
can
do
many
things
nay
much
that
they
trust
everything
to
themselves
and
youth
must
indeed
be
in
this
position
if
anything
is
to
be
made
of
it
a
survey
of
the
science
of
jurisprudence
and
all
its
framework
i
had
pretty
well
acquired
single
subjects
of
law
sufficiently
interested
me
and
as
i
had
the
good
leyser
for
my
model
i
thought
i
should
get
tolerably
through
with
my
own
little
great
movements
were
showing
themselves
in
jurisprudence
judgments
were
to
be
more
according
to
equity
all
rights
by
usage
were
daily
seen
to
be
compromised
and
in
the
criminal
department
especially
a
great
change
was
impending
as
for
myself
i
felt
well
enough
that
i
lacked
an
infinite
deal
to
fill
up
the
legal
commonplace
which
i
had
proposed
the
proper
knowledge
was
wanting
and
no
inner
tendency
urged
me
to
such
subjects
neither
was
there
any
impulse
from
without
nay
quite
another
faculty
had
completely
earned
me
away
in
general
if
i
was
to
take
any
interest
in
a
thing
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
gain
something
from
it
to
perceive
in
it
something
that
appeared
fertile
to
me
and
gave
me
prospects
thus
i
had
once
more
noted
down
some
materials
had
afterwards
made
collections
had
taken
my
books
of
extracts
in
hand
had
considered
the
point
which
i
wished
to
maintain
the
scheme
according
to
which
i
wished
to
arrange
the
single
elements
but
i
was
sharp
enough
soon
to
perceive
that
i
could
not
get
on
and
that
to
treat
a
special
matter
a
special
and
long
pursuing
industry
was
requisite
nay
that
such
a
special
task
can
not
be
successfully
accomplished
unless
upon
the
whole
one
is
at
any
rate
an
old
hand
if
not
a
master
the
friends
to
whom
i
communicated
my
embarrassment
deemed
me
ridiculous
because
one
can
dispute
upon
as
well
nay
even
better
than
upon
a
treatise
and
in
strasburg
this
was
not
uncommon
i
allowed
myself
to
be
very
well
inclined
to
such
an
expedient
but
my
father
to
whom
i
wrote
on
the
subject
desired
a
regular
work
which
as
he
thought
i
could
very
well
prepare
if
i
only
chose
so
to
do
and
allowed
myself
proper
time
i
was
now
compelled
to
throw
myself
upon
some
general
topic
and
to
choose
something
which
i
should
have
at
my
fingers
ends
ecclesiastical
history
was
almost
better
known
to
me
than
the
history
of
the
world
and
that
conflict
in
which
the
church
the
publicly
recognised
worship
of
god
finds
itself
and
always
will
find
itself
in
two
different
directions
had
always
highly
interested
me
for
now
it
lies
in
an
eternal
conflict
with
the
state
over
which
it
will
exalt
itself
now
with
the
individuals
all
of
whom
it
will
gather
to
itself
the
state
on
its
side
will
not
yield
the
superior
authority
to
the
church
and
the
individuals
oppose
its
restraints
the
state
desires
everything
for
public
universal
ends
the
individual
for
ends
belonging
to
the
home
heart
and
feelings
from
my
childhood
upwards
i
had
been
a
witness
of
such
movements
when
the
clergy
now
offended
their
authorities
now
their
congregations
i
had
therefore
established
it
as
a
principle
in
my
young
mind
that
the
state
the
legislator
had
the
right
to
determine
a
worship
according
to
which
the
clergy
should
teach
and
conduct
themselves
and
the
laity
on
the
other
hand
should
direct
themselves
publicly
and
externally
while
there
should
be
no
question
about
any
thoughts
feelings
or
notions
thus
i
believed
that
i
had
at
once
got
rid
of
all
collisions
i
therefore
chose
for
my
the
first
half
of
this
theme
namely
that
the
legislator
was
not
only
authorised
but
bound
to
establish
a
certain
worship
from
which
neither
the
clergy
nor
the
laity
might
free
themselves
i
carried
out
this
theme
partly
historically
partly
argumentatively
showing
that
all
public
religions
had
been
introduced
by
leaders
of
armies
kings
and
powerful
men
that
this
had
even
been
the
case
with
christianity
the
example
of
protestantism
lay
quite
close
at
hand
i
went
to
work
at
this
task
with
so
much
the
more
boldness
as
i
really
only
wrote
it
to
satisfy
my
father
and
desired
and
hoped
nothing
more
ardently
than
that
it
might
not
pass
the
censorship
i
had
imbibed
from
behrisch
an
unconquerable
dislike
to
see
anything
of
mine
in
print
and
my
intercourse
with
herder
had
discovered
to
mo
but
too
plainly
my
own
insufficiency
nay
a
certain
mistrust
in
myself
had
through
this
means
been
perfectly
matured
as
i
drew
this
work
almost
entirely
out
of
myself
and
wrote
and
spoke
latin
with
fluency
the
time
which
i
expended
on
the
treatise
passed
very
agreeably
the
matter
had
at
least
some
foundation
the
style
naturally
speaking
was
not
bad
the
whole
was
pretty
well
rounded
off
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
it
i
went
through
it
with
a
good
latin
scholar
who
although
he
could
not
on
the
whole
improve
my
style
yet
easily
removed
all
striking
defects
so
that
something
was
produced
that
was
fit
to
be
shown
a
fair
copy
was
at
once
sent
to
my
father
who
disapproved
of
one
thing
namely
that
none
of
the
subjects
previously
taken
in
hand
had
been
worked
out
but
nevertheless
as
a
thorough
protestant
he
was
well
pleased
with
the
boldness
of
the
plan
my
singularities
were
tolerated
my
exertions
were
praised
and
he
promised
himself
an
important
effect
from
the
publication
of
the
work
the
disputation
i
now
handed
over
my
papers
to
the
faculty
who
fortunately
behaved
in
a
manner
as
prudent
as
it
was
polite
the
dean
a
lively
clever
man
began
with
many
laudations
of
my
work
then
went
on
to
what
was
doubtful
which
he
contrived
gradually
to
change
into
something
dangerous
and
concluded
by
saying
that
it
might
not
be
advisable
to
publish
this
work
as
an
academical
dissertation
the
had
shown
himself
to
the
faculty
as
a
thinking
young
man
of
whom
they
might
hope
the
best
they
would
willingly
not
to
delay
the
affair
allow
me
to
dispute
on
i
could
afterwards
publish
my
treatise
either
in
its
present
condition
or
more
elaborated
in
latin
or
in
another
language
this
would
everywhere
be
easy
to
me
as
a
private
man
and
a
protestant
and
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
an
applause
more
pure
and
more
general
i
scarcely
concealed
from
the
good
man
what
a
stone
his
discourse
rolled
from
my
heart
at
every
new
argument
which
he
advanced
that
he
might
not
trouble
me
nor
make
me
angry
by
his
refusal
my
mind
grew
more
and
more
easy
and
so
did
his
own
at
last
when
quite
unexpectedly
i
offered
no
resistance
to
his
reasons
but
on
the
contrary
found
them
extremely
obvious
and
promised
to
conduct
myself
according
to
his
counsel
and
guidance
i
therefore
sat
down
again
with
my
were
chosen
and
printed
and
the
disputation
with
the
opposition
of
my
went
off
with
great
merriment
and
even
with
facility
for
my
old
habit
of
turning
over
the
was
very
serviceable
to
me
and
i
could
pass
for
a
well
instructed
man
a
good
feast
according
to
custom
concluded
the
solemnity
my
father
however
was
very
dissatisfied
that
the
little
work
had
not
been
regularly
printed
as
a
because
he
had
hoped
that
i
should
gain
honour
by
it
on
my
entrance
into
frankfort
he
therefore
wished
to
publish
it
specially
but
i
represented
to
him
that
the
subject
which
was
only
sketched
could
be
more
completely
carried
out
at
some
future
time
he
put
up
the
manuscript
carefully
for
this
purpose
and
many
years
afterwards
i
saw
it
among
his
papers
schöpflin
i
took
my
degree
on
the
august
and
on
the
following
day
schöpflin
died
in
the
year
of
his
age
even
without
closer
contact
he
had
had
an
important
influence
upon
me
for
eminent
contemporaries
may
be
compared
to
the
greater
stars
towards
which
so
long
as
they
merely
stand
above
the
horizon
our
eye
is
turned
and
feels
strengthened
and
cultivated
if
it
is
only
allowed
to
take
such
perfections
into
itself
bountiful
nature
had
given
schöpflin
an
advantageous
exterior
a
slender
form
kindly
eyes
a
ready
mouth
and
a
thoroughly
agreeable
presence
neither
had
she
been
sparing
in
gifts
of
mind
to
her
favourite
and
his
good
fortune
was
the
result
of
innate
and
merits
without
any
troublesome
exertion
he
was
one
of
those
happy
men
who
are
inclined
to
unite
the
past
and
the
present
and
understand
how
to
connect
historical
knowledge
with
the
interests
of
life
born
in
the
baden
territory
educated
at
basle
and
strasburg
he
quite
properly
belonged
to
the
paradisiacal
valley
of
the
rhine
as
an
extensive
and
fatherland
his
mind
being
directed
to
historical
and
antiquarian
objects
he
readily
seized
upon
them
with
a
felicitous
power
of
representation
and
retained
them
by
the
most
convenient
memory
desirous
as
he
was
both
of
learning
and
of
teaching
he
pursued
a
course
of
study
and
of
life
which
equally
advanced
he
soon
emerges
and
rises
above
the
rest
without
any
kind
of
interruption
diffuses
himself
with
ease
through
the
literary
and
for
historical
knowledge
passes
everywhere
and
affability
attaches
itself
everywhere
he
travels
through
germany
holland
france
italy
he
comes
in
contact
with
all
the
learned
men
of
his
time
he
amuses
princes
and
it
is
only
when
by
his
lively
loquacity
the
hours
of
the
table
or
of
audience
are
lengthened
that
he
is
tedious
to
the
people
at
court
on
the
other
hand
he
acquires
the
confidence
of
the
statesmen
works
out
for
them
the
most
profound
legal
questions
and
thus
finds
everywhere
a
field
for
his
talent
in
many
places
they
attempt
to
retain
him
but
he
remains
faithful
to
strasburg
and
the
french
court
his
immoveable
german
honesty
is
recognised
even
there
he
is
even
protected
against
the
powerful
prætor
klingling
who
is
secretly
his
enemy
sociable
and
talkative
by
nature
he
extends
his
intercourse
with
the
world
as
well
as
his
knowledge
and
occupations
and
we
should
hardly
be
able
to
understand
whence
he
got
all
his
time
did
we
not
know
that
a
dislike
to
women
accompanied
him
through
his
whole
life
and
that
thus
he
gained
many
days
and
hours
which
are
happily
thrown
away
by
those
who
are
towards
the
ladies
for
the
rest
he
belongs
as
an
author
to
the
ordinary
sort
of
character
and
as
an
orator
to
the
multitude
his
programme
his
speeches
and
addresses
are
devoted
to
the
particular
day
to
the
approaching
solemnity
nay
his
great
work
belongs
to
life
as
he
recalls
the
past
freshens
up
faded
forms
reanimates
the
hewn
and
the
formed
stone
and
brings
obliterated
broken
inscriptions
for
a
second
time
before
the
eyes
and
mind
of
his
reader
in
such
a
manner
his
activity
fills
all
alsatia
and
the
neighbouring
country
in
baden
and
the
palatinate
he
preserves
to
an
extreme
old
age
an
uninterrupted
influence
at
mannheim
he
founds
the
academy
of
sciences
and
remains
president
of
it
till
his
death
i
never
approached
this
eminent
man
excepting
on
one
night
when
we
gave
him
a
our
more
filled
with
smoke
than
lighted
the
of
the
old
which
was
by
when
the
noise
of
the
music
had
ended
he
came
forward
and
stepped
into
the
midst
of
us
and
here
also
was
in
his
right
place
the
slender
cheerful
old
man
stood
with
his
light
free
manners
venerably
before
us
and
held
us
worthy
the
honour
of
a
address
which
he
delivered
to
us
in
an
amiable
paternal
manner
without
a
trace
of
restraint
or
pedantry
so
that
we
really
thought
ourselves
something
for
the
moment
for
indeed
he
treated
us
like
the
kings
and
princes
whom
he
had
been
so
often
called
upon
to
address
in
public
we
testified
our
satisfaction
aloud
trumpets
and
drums
repeatedly
sounded
and
the
dear
hopeful
academical
then
found
its
way
home
with
hearty
satisfaction
koch
and
oberlin
his
scholars
and
companions
in
study
koch
and
oberlin
were
men
in
close
connexion
with
me
my
taste
for
antiquarian
remains
was
passionate
they
often
let
me
into
the
museum
which
contained
in
many
ways
the
vouchers
to
his
great
work
on
alsace
even
this
work
i
had
not
known
intimately
until
after
that
journey
when
i
had
found
antiquities
on
the
spot
and
now
being
perfectly
advanced
i
could
on
longer
or
shorter
expeditions
render
present
to
myself
the
valley
of
the
rhine
as
a
roman
possession
and
finish
colouring
many
a
dream
of
times
past
scarcely
had
i
made
some
progress
in
this
than
oberlin
directed
me
to
the
monuments
of
the
middle
ages
and
made
me
acquainted
with
the
ruins
and
remains
the
seals
and
documents
which
those
times
have
left
behind
them
nay
sought
to
inspire
me
with
an
inclination
for
what
we
called
the
and
heroic
poets
to
this
good
man
as
well
as
to
herr
koch
i
have
been
greatly
indebted
and
if
things
had
gone
according
to
their
wish
i
should
have
had
to
thank
them
for
the
happiness
of
my
life
the
matter
stood
thus
schöpflin
who
for
his
whole
lifetime
had
moved
in
the
higher
sphere
of
political
law
and
well
knew
the
great
influence
which
such
and
kindred
studies
are
likely
to
procure
for
a
sound
head
in
courts
and
cabinets
felt
an
insuperable
nay
unjust
aversion
from
the
situation
of
a
civilian
and
had
inspired
his
scholars
the
like
sentiments
the
two
men
friends
of
salzmann
had
taken
notice
of
me
in
a
most
friendly
manner
my
impassioned
grasping
at
external
objects
the
manner
in
which
i
continued
to
bring
forward
their
advantages
and
to
communicate
to
them
a
particular
interest
they
prized
higher
than
i
did
myself
my
slight
and
i
may
say
my
scanty
occupation
with
the
civil
law
had
not
remained
unobserved
by
them
they
were
well
enough
acquainted
with
me
to
know
how
easily
i
was
to
be
influenced
i
had
made
no
secret
of
my
liking
for
an
academical
life
and
they
therefore
thought
to
gain
me
over
to
history
political
law
and
rhetoric
at
first
for
a
time
but
after
wards
more
decidedly
strasbourg
itself
offered
advantages
enough
the
prospect
of
the
german
chancery
at
versailles
the
precedent
of
schöpflin
whose
merits
indeed
seemed
to
me
unattainable
were
to
incite
to
emulation
if
not
to
imitation
and
perhaps
a
similar
talent
was
thus
to
be
cultivated
which
might
be
both
profitable
to
him
who
could
boast
of
it
and
useful
to
others
who
might
choose
to
employ
it
on
their
own
account
these
my
patrons
and
salzmann
with
them
set
a
great
value
on
my
memory
and
my
capacity
for
apprehending
the
sense
of
languages
and
chiefly
by
these
sought
to
further
their
views
and
plans
i
now
intend
to
describe
at
length
how
all
this
came
to
nothing
and
how
it
happened
that
i
again
passed
over
from
the
french
to
the
german
side
let
me
be
allowed
as
hitherto
some
general
reflections
by
way
of
transition
there
are
few
biographies
which
can
represent
a
pure
quiet
steady
progress
of
the
individual
our
life
as
well
as
all
in
which
we
are
contained
is
in
an
incomprehensible
manner
composed
of
freedom
and
necessity
our
will
is
a
prediction
of
what
we
shall
do
under
all
circumstances
but
these
circumstances
lay
hold
on
us
in
their
own
fashion
the
lies
in
us
the
seldom
depends
on
us
after
the
we
dare
not
ask
and
on
this
account
we
are
rightly
referred
to
the
the
french
tongue
i
had
liked
from
my
youth
upwards
i
had
learned
to
know
the
language
through
a
bustling
life
and
a
bustling
life
through
the
language
it
had
become
my
own
like
a
second
without
grammar
and
instruction
by
mere
intercourse
and
practice
i
now
wished
to
use
it
with
still
greater
fluency
and
gave
strasburg
the
preference
as
a
second
university
residence
to
other
high
schools
but
alas
it
was
just
there
that
i
had
to
experience
the
very
reverse
of
my
hopes
and
to
be
turned
rather
from
than
to
this
language
and
these
manners
the
french
who
generally
aim
at
good
behaviour
are
indulgent
towards
foreigners
who
begin
to
speak
their
language
they
will
not
laugh
any
one
out
of
countenance
at
a
fault
or
blame
him
in
direct
terms
however
since
they
can
not
endure
sins
committed
against
their
language
they
have
a
manner
of
repeating
and
as
it
were
courteously
confirming
what
has
been
said
with
another
turn
at
the
same
time
making
use
of
the
expression
which
should
properly
have
been
employed
thus
leading
the
intelligent
and
the
attentive
to
what
is
right
and
proper
difficulty
with
the
french
language
now
although
if
one
is
in
earnest
if
one
has
enough
to
profess
oneself
a
pupil
one
gains
a
great
deal
and
is
much
advanced
by
this
plan
one
nevertheless
always
feels
in
some
degree
humiliated
and
since
one
talks
for
the
sake
of
the
also
often
too
much
interrupted
or
even
distracted
so
that
one
impatiently
lets
the
conversation
drop
this
happened
with
me
more
than
with
others
as
i
always
thought
that
i
had
to
say
something
interesting
and
on
the
other
hand
to
hear
something
important
and
did
not
wish
to
be
always
brought
back
merely
to
the
expression
a
case
which
often
occurred
with
me
as
my
french
was
just
as
motley
as
that
of
any
other
foreigner
i
had
observed
the
accent
and
idiom
of
footmen
valets
guards
young
and
old
actors
theatrical
lovers
peasants
and
heroes
and
this
babylonish
idiom
was
rendered
still
more
confused
by
another
odd
ingredient
as
i
liked
to
hear
the
french
reformed
clergy
and
visited
their
churches
the
more
willingly
as
a
sunday
walk
to
bockenheim
was
on
this
account
not
only
permitted
but
ordered
but
even
this
was
not
enough
for
as
in
my
youthful
years
i
had
always
been
chiefly
directed
to
the
german
of
the
century
i
soon
included
the
french
also
of
that
noble
epoch
among
the
objects
of
my
inclination
montaigne
amyot
rabelais
marot
were
my
friends
and
excited
in
me
sympathy
and
delight
now
all
these
different
elements
moved
in
my
discourse
chaotically
one
with
another
so
that
for
the
hearer
the
meaning
was
lost
in
the
oddity
of
the
expression
nay
an
educated
frenchman
could
no
more
courteously
correct
me
but
had
to
censure
me
and
tutor
me
in
plain
terms
it
therefore
happened
with
me
here
once
more
as
it
had
happened
in
leipzig
only
that
on
this
occasion
i
could
not
appeal
to
the
right
of
my
native
place
to
speak
idiomatically
as
well
as
other
provinces
but
being
on
a
foreign
ground
and
soil
was
forced
to
adapt
myself
to
traditional
laws
perhaps
we
might
even
have
resigned
ourselves
to
this
if
an
evil
genius
had
not
whispered
into
our
ears
that
all
endeavours
by
a
foreigner
to
speak
french
would
remain
unsuccessful
for
a
practised
ear
can
perfectly
well
detect
a
german
italian
or
englishman
under
a
french
mask
one
is
tolerated
but
never
received
into
the
bosom
of
the
only
church
of
language
only
a
few
exceptions
were
granted
they
named
to
us
a
herr
von
grimm
but
even
schöpflin
it
seemed
did
not
reach
the
summit
they
allowed
that
he
had
early
seen
the
necessity
of
expressing
himself
in
french
to
perfection
they
approved
of
his
inclination
to
converse
with
every
one
and
especially
to
entertain
the
great
and
persons
of
rank
they
praised
him
that
living
in
the
place
where
he
was
he
had
made
the
language
of
the
country
his
own
and
had
endeavoured
as
much
as
possible
to
render
himself
a
frenchman
of
society
and
orator
but
what
does
he
gain
by
the
denial
of
his
and
his
endeavours
after
a
foreign
one
he
can
not
make
it
right
with
anybody
in
society
they
are
pleased
to
deem
him
vain
as
if
any
one
would
or
could
converse
with
others
without
some
feeling
for
self
and
then
the
refined
connoisseurs
of
the
world
and
of
language
assert
that
there
is
in
him
more
of
dissertation
and
dialogue
than
of
conversation
properly
so
called
the
former
was
generally
recognised
as
the
original
and
fundamental
sin
of
the
germans
the
latter
as
the
cardinal
virtue
of
the
french
as
a
public
orator
he
fares
no
better
if
he
prints
a
address
to
the
king
or
the
princes
the
jesuits
who
are
to
him
as
a
protestant
lay
wait
for
him
and
show
that
his
terms
of
expression
are
instead
of
consoling
ourselves
with
this
and
bearing
as
green
wood
that
which
had
been
laid
upon
the
dry
we
were
annoyed
at
such
pedantic
injustice
we
fall
into
despair
and
by
this
striking
example
are
the
more
convinced
that
it
is
a
vain
endeavour
to
try
to
satisfy
the
french
by
the
matter
itself
as
they
are
too
closely
bound
to
the
external
conditions
under
which
everything
is
to
appear
we
therefore
embrace
the
opposite
resolution
of
getting
rid
of
the
french
language
altogether
and
of
directing
ourselves
more
than
ever
with
might
and
earnestness
to
our
own
and
for
this
we
found
opportunity
and
sympathy
in
actual
life
alsace
had
not
been
connected
with
france
so
long
that
an
affectionate
adherence
to
the
old
constitution
manners
language
and
costume
did
not
still
exist
with
old
and
young
if
the
conquered
party
loses
half
his
existence
by
compulsion
he
looks
upon
it
as
disgraceful
voluntarily
to
part
with
the
other
half
he
therefore
holds
fast
to
all
that
can
recall
to
him
the
good
old
time
and
foster
in
him
the
hope
that
a
better
epoch
will
return
very
many
inhabitants
of
strasburg
formed
little
circles
separate
indeed
but
nevertheless
united
in
spirit
which
were
always
increased
and
recruited
by
the
numerous
subjects
of
german
princes
who
held
considerable
lands
under
french
sovereignty
since
fathers
and
sons
either
for
the
sake
of
study
or
business
resided
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
at
strasburg
at
our
table
nothing
but
german
was
spoken
salzmann
expressed
himself
in
french
with
much
fluency
and
elegance
but
with
respect
to
his
endeavours
and
acts
was
a
perfect
german
lerse
might
have
been
set
up
as
a
pattern
of
a
german
youth
meyer
of
lindau
liked
to
get
on
with
good
german
too
well
to
shine
in
good
french
and
if
among
the
rest
many
were
inclined
to
the
gallic
speech
and
manners
they
yet
while
they
were
with
us
allowed
the
general
tone
to
prevail
with
them
dislike
to
the
french
from
the
language
we
turned
to
political
affairs
we
had
not
indeed
much
to
say
in
praise
of
our
own
imperial
constitution
we
granted
that
it
consisted
of
mere
legal
contradictions
but
exalted
ourselves
so
much
the
more
above
the
present
french
constitution
which
lost
itself
in
mere
lawless
abuses
while
the
government
only
showed
its
energy
in
the
wrong
place
and
was
forced
to
admit
that
a
complete
change
in
affairs
was
already
publicly
prophesied
with
black
forebodings
if
on
the
other
hand
we
looked
towards
the
north
we
were
shone
upon
by
frederic
the
who
seemed
to
turn
about
himself
germany
europe
nay
the
whole
world
his
preponderance
in
everything
was
most
strongly
manifested
when
the
prussian
exercise
and
even
the
prussian
stick
was
introduced
into
the
french
army
as
for
the
rest
we
forgave
him
his
predilection
for
a
foreign
language
since
we
felt
satisfaction
that
his
french
poets
philosophers
and
continued
to
annoy
him
and
often
declared
that
he
was
to
be
considered
and
treated
only
as
an
intruder
but
what
more
than
all
forcibly
alienated
us
from
the
french
was
the
unpolite
opinion
repeatedly
maintained
that
the
germans
in
general
as
well
as
the
king
who
was
striving
after
french
cultivation
were
deficient
in
taste
with
respect
to
this
kind
of
talk
which
followed
every
judgment
like
a
burden
we
endeavoured
to
solace
ourselves
with
contempt
but
we
could
so
much
the
less
come
to
a
clear
understanding
about
it
as
we
were
assured
that
menage
had
already
said
that
the
french
writers
possessed
everything
but
taste
and
had
also
learned
from
the
then
living
paris
that
all
the
authors
were
wanting
in
taste
and
that
voltaire
himself
could
not
escape
this
severest
of
reproaches
having
been
before
and
often
directed
to
nature
we
would
allow
of
nothing
but
truth
and
uprightness
of
feeling
and
the
quick
blunt
expression
of
it
friendship
love
and
brotherhood
are
they
not
was
the
watchword
and
cry
of
battle
by
which
the
members
of
our
little
academical
horde
used
to
know
and
enliven
each
other
this
maxim
lay
at
the
foundation
of
all
our
social
banquets
on
the
occasions
of
which
we
did
not
fail
to
pay
many
an
evening
visit
to
cousin
michel
in
his
if
in
what
has
hitherto
been
described
only
external
contingent
causes
and
personal
peculiarities
are
found
the
french
literature
had
in
itself
certain
qualities
which
were
rather
repulsive
than
attractive
to
an
aspiring
youth
it
was
advanced
in
years
and
genteel
and
by
neither
of
these
qualities
can
youth
which
looks
about
for
enjoyment
of
life
and
for
freedom
be
delighted
since
the
sixteenth
century
the
course
of
french
literature
had
never
been
seen
to
be
completely
interrupted
nay
the
internal
and
religious
disturbances
as
well
as
the
external
wars
had
accelerated
its
progress
but
as
we
heard
generally
maintained
it
was
a
hundred
years
ago
that
it
had
existed
in
its
full
bloom
through
favourable
circumstances
they
said
an
abundant
harvest
had
at
once
ripened
and
had
been
happily
gathered
in
so
that
the
great
talents
of
the
eighteenth
century
had
to
be
moderately
contented
with
mere
gleanings
in
the
meanwhile
however
much
had
become
antiquated
first
of
all
comedy
which
had
to
be
freshened
up
to
adapt
itself
less
perfectly
indeed
but
still
with
new
interest
to
actual
life
and
manners
of
the
tragedies
many
had
vanished
from
the
stage
and
voltaire
did
not
let
slip
the
important
opportunity
which
offered
of
editing
works
that
he
might
show
how
defective
his
predecessor
had
been
whom
according
to
the
general
voice
he
had
not
equalled
voltaire
and
even
this
very
voltaire
the
wonder
of
his
time
had
grown
old
like
the
literature
which
for
nearly
a
century
he
had
animated
and
governed
by
his
side
still
existed
and
vegetated
many
in
a
more
or
less
active
and
happy
old
age
who
one
by
one
disappeared
the
influence
of
society
upon
authors
increased
more
and
more
for
the
best
society
consisting
of
persons
of
birth
rank
and
property
chose
for
one
of
their
chief
recreations
literature
which
thus
became
quite
social
and
genteel
persons
of
rank
and
mutually
cultivated
and
necessarily
perverted
each
other
for
the
genteel
has
always
something
excluding
in
its
nature
and
excluding
also
was
the
french
criticism
being
negative
detracting
and
the
higher
class
made
use
of
such
judgments
against
the
authors
the
authors
with
somewhat
less
decorum
proceeded
in
the
same
manner
against
each
other
nay
against
their
patrons
if
the
public
was
not
to
be
awed
they
endeavoured
to
take
it
by
surprise
or
gain
it
by
humility
and
thus
apart
from
the
movements
which
shook
church
and
state
to
their
inmost
core
there
arose
such
a
literary
ferment
that
voltaire
himself
stood
in
need
of
his
full
activity
and
his
whole
preponderance
to
keep
himself
above
the
torrent
of
general
disesteem
already
he
was
openly
called
an
old
capricious
child
his
endeavours
carried
on
indefatigably
were
regarded
as
the
vain
efforts
of
a
decrepid
age
certain
principles
on
which
he
had
stood
during
his
whole
life
and
to
the
spread
of
which
he
had
devoted
his
days
were
no
more
held
in
esteem
and
honour
nay
his
deity
by
acknowledging
whom
he
continued
to
declare
himself
free
from
atheism
was
not
conceded
him
and
thus
he
himself
the
grandsire
and
patriarch
was
forced
like
his
youngest
competitor
to
watch
the
present
moment
to
catch
at
new
power
to
do
his
friends
too
much
good
and
his
enemies
too
much
harm
and
under
the
appearance
of
a
passionate
striving
for
the
love
of
truth
to
act
deceitfully
and
falsely
was
it
worth
the
trouble
to
have
led
such
a
great
active
life
if
it
was
to
end
in
greater
dependence
than
it
had
begun
how
insupportable
such
a
position
was
did
not
escape
his
high
mind
his
delicate
sensibility
he
often
relieved
himself
by
leaps
and
thrusts
gave
the
reins
to
his
humour
and
carried
a
few
of
his
too
far
at
which
friends
and
enemies
for
the
most
part
showed
themselves
indignant
for
every
one
thought
he
could
play
the
superior
to
him
though
no
one
could
equal
him
a
public
which
only
hears
the
judgment
of
old
men
becomes
too
soon
and
nothing
is
more
unsatisfactory
than
a
mature
judgment
adopted
by
an
immature
mind
to
us
youths
before
whom
with
our
german
love
of
truth
and
nature
honesty
towards
both
ourselves
and
others
hovered
as
the
best
guide
both
in
life
and
learning
the
factious
dishonesty
of
voltaire
and
the
perversion
of
so
many
worthy
subjects
became
more
and
more
annoying
and
we
daily
strengthened
ourselves
in
our
aversion
from
him
he
could
never
have
done
with
degrading
religion
and
the
sacred
books
for
the
sake
of
injuring
priestcraft
as
they
called
it
and
had
thus
produced
in
me
many
an
unpleasant
sensation
but
when
i
now
learned
that
to
weaken
the
tradition
of
a
deluge
he
had
denied
all
petrified
shells
and
only
admitted
them
as
he
entirely
lost
my
confidence
for
my
own
eyes
had
on
the
baschberg
plainly
enough
shown
me
that
i
stood
on
the
bottom
of
an
old
sea
among
the
of
its
original
inhabitants
these
mountains
had
certainly
been
once
covered
with
waves
whether
before
or
during
the
deluge
did
not
concern
me
it
was
enough
that
the
valley
of
the
rhine
had
been
a
monstrous
lake
a
bay
extending
beyond
the
reach
of
the
eyesight
out
of
this
i
was
not
to
be
talked
i
thought
much
more
of
advancing
in
the
knowledge
of
lands
and
mountains
let
what
would
be
the
result
french
literature
then
had
grown
old
and
genteel
in
itself
and
through
voltaire
let
us
devote
some
further
consideration
to
this
remarkable
man
from
his
youth
upwards
voltaire
wishes
and
endeavours
had
been
directed
to
an
active
and
social
life
to
politics
to
gain
on
a
large
scale
to
a
connexion
with
the
heads
of
the
earth
and
a
profitable
use
of
this
connexion
that
he
himself
might
be
one
of
the
heads
of
the
earth
also
no
one
has
easily
made
himself
so
dependent
for
the
sake
of
being
independent
he
even
succeeded
in
subjugating
minds
the
nation
became
his
own
in
vain
did
his
opponents
unfold
their
moderate
talents
and
their
monstrous
hate
nothing
succeeded
in
injuring
him
the
court
he
could
never
reconcile
to
himself
but
by
way
of
compensation
foreign
kings
were
his
tributaries
katharine
and
frederic
the
great
gustavus
of
sweden
christian
of
denmark
peniotowsky
of
poland
henry
of
prussia
charles
of
brunswick
acknowledged
themselves
his
vassals
even
popes
thought
they
must
coax
him
by
some
acts
of
indulgence
that
joseph
the
second
had
kept
aloof
from
him
did
not
at
all
redound
to
the
honour
of
this
prince
for
it
would
have
done
no
harm
to
him
and
his
undertakings
if
with
such
a
fine
intellect
and
with
such
noble
views
he
had
been
somewhat
more
practically
clever
and
a
better
appreciator
of
the
mind
what
i
have
here
stated
in
a
compressed
form
and
in
some
connexion
sounded
at
that
time
as
a
cry
of
the
moment
as
a
perpetual
discord
unconnected
and
uninstructive
in
our
ears
nothing
was
heard
but
the
praise
of
those
who
had
gone
before
something
good
and
new
was
required
but
the
newest
was
never
liked
scarcely
had
a
patriot
exhibited
on
the
long
inanimate
stage
subjects
scarcely
had
the
of
gained
enthusiastic
applause
than
the
piece
together
with
all
its
national
comrades
was
considered
empty
and
in
every
sense
objectionable
the
delineations
of
manners
by
destouches
which
had
so
often
delighted
me
when
a
boy
were
called
weak
the
name
of
this
honest
man
had
passed
away
and
how
many
authors
could
i
not
point
out
for
the
sake
of
whom
i
had
to
endure
the
reproach
that
i
judged
like
a
provincial
if
i
showed
any
sympathy
for
such
men
and
their
works
in
opposition
to
any
one
who
was
carried
along
by
the
newest
literary
torrent
thus
to
our
other
german
comrades
we
became
more
and
more
annoying
according
to
our
view
according
to
the
peculiarity
of
our
own
nature
we
had
to
retain
the
impressions
of
objects
to
consume
them
but
slowly
and
if
it
was
to
be
so
to
let
them
go
as
late
as
possible
we
were
convinced
that
by
faithful
observation
by
continued
occupation
something
might
be
gained
from
all
things
and
that
by
persevering
zeal
we
must
at
last
arrive
at
a
point
where
the
ground
of
the
judgment
may
be
expressed
at
the
same
time
with
the
judgment
itself
neither
did
we
fail
to
perceive
that
the
great
and
noble
french
world
offered
us
many
an
advantage
and
much
profit
for
rousseau
had
really
touched
our
sympathies
but
if
we
considered
his
life
and
his
fate
he
was
nevertheless
compelled
to
find
the
great
reward
for
all
he
did
in
this
that
he
could
live
unacknowledged
and
forgotten
at
paris
the
encyclopedists
if
we
heard
the
encyclopedists
mentioned
or
opened
a
volume
of
their
monstrous
work
we
felt
as
if
we
were
going
between
the
innumerable
moving
spools
and
looms
in
a
great
factory
where
what
with
the
mere
creaking
and
rattling
what
with
all
the
mechanism
embarrassing
both
eyes
and
senses
what
with
the
mere
incomprehensibility
of
an
arrangement
the
parts
of
which
work
into
each
other
in
the
most
manifold
way
what
with
the
contemplation
of
all
that
is
necessary
to
prepare
a
piece
of
cloth
we
feel
disgusted
with
the
very
coat
which
we
wear
upon
our
backs
diderot
was
sufficiently
akin
to
us
as
indeed
in
everything
for
which
the
french
blame
him
he
is
a
true
german
but
even
his
point
of
view
was
too
high
his
circle
of
vision
was
too
extended
for
us
to
range
ourselves
with
him
and
place
ourselves
at
his
side
nevertheless
his
children
of
nature
whom
he
continued
to
bring
forward
and
dignify
with
great
rhetorical
art
pleased
us
very
much
his
brave
poachers
and
smugglers
enchanted
us
and
this
rabble
afterwards
throve
but
too
well
upon
the
german
parnassus
it
was
he
also
who
like
rousseau
diffused
a
disgust
of
social
life
a
quiet
introduction
to
those
monstrous
changes
of
the
world
in
which
everything
permanent
appeared
to
sink
however
we
ought
now
to
put
aside
these
considerations
and
to
remark
what
influence
these
two
men
have
had
upon
art
even
here
they
pointed
even
from
here
they
urged
us
towards
nature
the
highest
problem
of
any
art
is
to
produce
by
appearance
the
illusion
of
a
higher
reality
but
it
is
a
false
endeavour
to
realize
the
appearance
until
at
last
only
something
commonly
real
remains
as
an
ideal
locality
the
stage
by
the
application
of
the
laws
of
perspective
to
ranged
one
behind
the
other
had
attained
the
greatest
advantage
and
this
very
gain
they
now
wished
wantonly
to
abandon
by
shutting
up
the
sides
of
the
theatre
and
forming
real
with
such
an
arrangement
of
the
stage
the
piece
itself
the
actors
mode
of
playing
in
a
word
everything
was
to
coincide
and
thus
an
entirely
new
theatre
was
to
arise
the
french
actors
had
in
comedy
attained
the
summit
of
the
true
in
art
their
residence
at
paris
their
observations
of
the
externals
of
the
court
the
connexion
of
the
actors
and
actresses
with
the
highest
classes
by
means
of
love
affairs
all
contributed
to
transplant
to
the
stage
the
greatest
realness
and
seemliness
of
social
life
and
on
this
point
the
friends
of
nature
found
but
little
to
blame
however
they
thought
they
made
a
great
advance
if
they
chose
for
their
pieces
earnest
and
tragical
subjects
in
which
the
should
not
be
wanting
used
prose
for
the
higher
mode
of
expression
and
thus
banished
unnatural
verse
together
with
unnatural
declamation
and
gesticulation
it
is
extremely
remarkable
and
has
not
been
generally
noticed
that
at
this
time
even
the
old
severe
rhythmical
artistical
tragedy
was
threatened
with
a
revolution
which
could
only
be
averted
by
great
talents
and
the
power
of
tradition
in
opposition
to
the
actor
le
kain
who
played
his
heroes
with
especial
theatrical
decorum
with
deliberation
elevation
and
force
and
kept
himself
aloof
from
the
natural
and
ordinary
came
forward
a
man
named
aufresne
who
declared
war
against
everything
unnatural
and
in
his
tragic
acting
sought
to
express
the
highest
truth
this
mode
might
not
have
accorded
with
that
of
the
other
parisian
actors
he
stood
alone
while
they
kept
together
and
adhering
to
his
views
obstinately
enough
he
chose
to
leave
paris
rather
than
alter
them
and
came
through
strasburg
there
we
saw
him
play
the
part
of
augustus
in
that
of
mithridates
and
others
of
the
sort
with
the
truest
and
most
natural
dignity
he
appeared
as
a
tall
handsome
man
more
slender
than
strong
not
properly
speaking
with
an
imposing
but
nevertheless
with
a
noble
pleasing
demeanour
his
acting
was
and
quiet
without
being
cold
and
forcible
enough
where
force
was
required
he
was
a
very
actor
and
one
of
the
few
who
know
how
to
turn
the
artificial
completely
into
nature
and
nature
completely
into
the
artificial
it
is
really
those
few
whose
misunderstood
good
qualities
always
originate
the
doctrine
of
false
naturalness
rousseau
pygmalion
and
thus
will
i
also
make
mention
of
a
work
which
is
indeed
small
but
which
made
an
epoch
in
a
remarkable
manner
i
mean
a
great
deal
could
be
said
upon
it
for
this
strange
production
floats
between
nature
and
art
with
the
full
endeavour
of
resolving
the
latter
into
the
former
we
see
an
artist
who
has
produced
what
is
most
perfect
and
yet
does
not
find
any
satisfaction
in
having
according
to
art
represented
his
idea
externally
to
himself
and
given
to
it
a
higher
life
no
it
must
also
be
drawn
down
to
him
into
the
earthly
life
he
will
destroy
the
highest
thing
that
mind
and
deed
have
produced
by
the
commonest
act
of
sensuality
all
this
and
much
else
right
and
foolish
true
and
operating
upon
us
as
it
did
still
more
perplexed
our
notions
we
were
driven
astray
through
many
and
roundabout
ways
and
thus
on
many
sides
was
prepared
that
german
literary
revolution
of
which
we
were
witnesses
and
to
which
consciously
or
unconsciously
willingly
or
unwillingly
we
unceasingly
contributed
we
had
neither
impulse
nor
tendency
to
be
illumined
and
advanced
in
a
philosophical
manner
on
religious
subjects
we
thought
we
had
sufficiently
enlightened
ourselves
and
therefore
the
violent
contest
of
the
french
philosophers
with
the
priesthood
was
tolerably
indifferent
to
us
prohibited
books
condemned
to
the
flames
which
then
made
a
great
noise
produced
no
effect
upon
us
i
mention
as
an
instance
to
serve
for
all
the
de
la
which
we
took
in
hand
out
of
curiosity
we
did
not
understand
how
such
a
book
could
be
dangerous
it
appeared
to
us
so
dark
so
cimmerian
so
deathlike
that
we
found
it
a
trouble
to
endure
its
presence
and
shuddered
at
it
as
at
a
spectre
the
author
fancies
he
gives
his
book
a
peculiar
recommendation
when
he
declares
in
his
preface
that
as
a
decrepit
old
man
just
sinking
into
the
grave
he
wishes
to
announce
the
truth
to
his
contemporaries
and
to
posterity
we
laughed
him
out
for
we
thought
we
had
observed
that
by
old
people
nothing
in
the
world
that
is
loveable
and
good
is
in
fact
appreciated
old
churches
have
dark
windows
to
know
how
cherries
and
berries
taste
we
must
ask
children
and
sparrows
these
were
our
gibes
and
maxims
and
thus
that
book
as
the
very
quintessence
of
senility
appeared
to
us
as
unsavoury
nay
absurd
all
was
to
be
of
necessity
so
said
the
book
and
therefore
there
was
no
god
but
could
there
not
be
a
god
by
necessity
too
asked
we
we
indeed
confessed
at
the
same
time
that
we
could
not
withdraw
ourselves
from
the
necessities
of
day
and
night
the
seasons
the
influence
of
climate
physical
and
animal
condition
but
nevertheless
we
felt
within
us
something
that
appeared
like
perfect
freedom
of
will
and
again
something
which
sought
to
counterbalance
this
freedom
the
hope
of
becoming
more
and
more
rational
of
making
ourselves
more
and
more
independent
of
external
things
nay
of
ourselves
we
could
not
give
up
the
word
freedom
sounds
so
beautiful
that
we
can
not
do
without
it
even
though
it
designates
an
error
système
de
la
nature
none
of
us
had
read
the
book
through
for
we
found
ourselves
deceived
in
the
expectations
with
which
we
had
opened
it
a
system
of
nature
was
announced
and
therefore
we
hoped
to
learn
really
something
of
nature
our
idol
physics
and
chemistry
descriptions
of
heaven
and
earth
natural
history
and
anatomy
with
much
else
had
now
for
years
and
up
to
the
last
day
constantly
directed
us
to
the
great
adorned
world
and
we
would
willingly
have
heard
both
particulars
and
generals
about
suns
and
stars
planets
and
moons
mountains
valleys
rivers
and
seas
with
all
that
live
and
move
in
them
that
in
the
course
of
this
much
must
occur
which
would
appear
to
the
common
man
as
injurious
to
the
clergy
as
dangerous
and
to
the
state
as
inadmissible
we
had
no
doubt
and
we
hoped
that
the
little
book
had
not
unworthily
stood
the
fiery
ordeal
but
how
hollow
and
empty
did
we
feel
in
this
melancholy
atheistical
in
which
earth
vanished
with
all
its
images
heaven
with
all
its
stars
there
was
to
be
a
matter
in
motion
from
all
eternity
and
by
this
motion
right
and
left
and
in
every
direction
without
anything
further
it
was
to
produce
the
infinite
phenomena
of
existence
even
all
this
we
should
have
allowed
to
pass
if
the
author
out
of
his
moved
matter
had
really
built
up
the
world
before
our
eyes
but
he
seemed
to
know
as
little
about
nature
as
we
did
for
having
set
up
some
general
ideas
he
quits
them
at
once
for
the
sake
of
changing
that
which
appears
as
higher
than
nature
or
as
a
higher
nature
within
nature
into
material
heavy
nature
which
is
moved
indeed
but
without
direction
or
form
and
thus
he
fancies
he
has
gained
a
great
deal
if
after
all
this
book
did
us
any
mischief
it
was
this
that
we
took
a
hearty
dislike
to
all
philosophy
and
especially
metaphysics
and
remained
in
that
dislike
while
on
the
other
hand
we
threw
ourselves
into
living
knowledge
experience
action
and
poetising
with
all
the
more
liveliness
and
passion
thus
on
the
very
borders
of
france
we
had
at
once
got
rid
and
clear
of
everything
french
about
us
the
french
way
of
life
we
found
too
defined
and
genteel
their
poetry
cold
their
criticism
annihilating
their
philosophy
abstruse
and
yet
insufficient
so
that
we
were
on
the
point
of
resigning
ourselves
to
rude
nature
at
least
by
way
of
experiment
if
another
influence
had
not
for
a
long
time
prepared
us
for
higher
and
freer
views
of
the
world
and
intellectual
enjoyments
as
true
as
they
were
poetical
and
swayed
us
first
moderately
and
secretly
but
afterwards
with
more
and
more
openness
and
force
i
need
scarcely
say
that
shakspeare
is
intended
and
having
once
said
this
no
more
need
be
added
shakspeare
has
been
acknowledged
by
the
germans
more
by
them
than
by
other
nations
perhaps
even
more
than
by
his
own
we
have
richly
bestowed
on
him
all
that
justice
fairness
and
forbearance
which
we
refuse
to
ourselves
eminent
men
have
occupied
themselves
in
showing
his
talents
in
the
most
favourable
light
and
i
have
always
readily
subscribed
to
what
has
been
said
to
his
honour
in
his
favour
or
even
by
way
of
excuse
for
him
the
influence
of
this
extraordinary
mind
upon
me
has
been
already
shown
an
attempt
has
been
made
with
respect
to
his
works
which
has
received
approbation
and
therefore
this
general
statement
may
suffice
for
the
present
until
i
am
in
a
position
to
communicate
to
such
friends
as
like
to
hear
me
a
gleaning
of
reflections
on
his
great
deserts
such
as
i
was
tempted
to
insert
in
this
very
place
at
present
i
will
only
show
more
clearly
the
manner
in
which
i
became
acquainted
with
him
it
happened
pretty
soon
at
leipzig
through
dodd
of
whatever
may
be
said
against
such
collections
which
give
authors
in
a
fragmentary
form
they
nevertheless
produce
many
good
effects
we
are
not
always
so
collected
and
so
ready
that
we
can
take
in
a
whole
work
according
to
its
merits
do
we
not
in
a
book
mark
passages
which
have
an
immediate
reference
to
ourselves
young
people
especially
who
are
wanting
in
a
thorough
cultivation
are
laudably
excited
by
brilliant
passages
and
thus
i
myself
remember
as
one
of
the
most
beautiful
epochs
of
my
life
that
which
is
characterised
by
the
work
those
noble
peculiarities
those
great
sayings
those
happy
descriptions
those
humorous
traits
all
struck
me
singly
and
powerfully
wieland
translation
now
made
its
appearance
it
was
devoured
communicated
and
recommended
to
friends
and
acquaintances
we
germans
had
the
advantage
that
many
important
works
of
foreign
nations
were
first
brought
over
to
us
in
an
easy
and
cheerful
fashion
shakspeare
translated
in
prose
first
by
wieland
afterwards
by
eschenburg
was
able
as
a
kind
of
reading
universally
intelligible
and
suitable
to
any
reader
to
diffuse
itself
speedily
and
to
produce
a
great
effect
i
revere
the
rhythm
as
well
as
the
rhyme
by
which
poetry
first
becomes
poetry
but
that
which
is
really
deeply
and
fundamentally
effective
that
which
is
really
permanent
and
furthering
is
that
which
remains
of
the
poet
when
it
is
translated
into
prose
then
remains
the
pure
perfect
substance
of
which
when
absent
a
dazzling
exterior
often
contrives
to
make
a
false
show
and
which
when
present
such
an
exterior
contrives
to
conceal
i
therefore
consider
prose
translations
more
advantageous
than
poetical
for
the
beginning
of
youthful
culture
for
it
may
be
remarked
that
boys
to
whom
everything
must
serve
as
a
jest
delight
themselves
with
the
sound
of
words
and
the
fall
of
syllables
and
by
a
sort
of
parodistical
wantonness
destroy
the
deep
contents
of
the
noblest
work
hence
i
would
have
it
considered
whether
a
prose
translation
of
homer
should
not
be
next
undertaken
though
this
indeed
must
be
worthy
of
the
degree
at
which
german
literature
stands
at
present
i
leave
this
and
what
has
been
already
said
to
the
consideration
of
our
worthy
pedagogues
to
whom
an
extensive
experience
on
this
matter
is
most
at
command
i
will
only
in
favour
of
my
proposition
mention
luther
translation
of
the
bible
for
the
circumstance
that
this
excellent
man
handed
down
a
work
composed
in
the
most
different
styles
and
gave
us
its
poetical
historical
commanding
didactic
tone
in
our
as
if
all
were
cast
in
one
mould
has
done
more
to
advance
religion
than
if
he
had
attempted
to
imitate
in
detail
the
peculiarities
of
the
original
in
vain
has
been
the
subsequent
endeavour
to
make
job
the
psalms
and
the
other
lyrical
books
capable
of
affording
enjoyment
in
their
poetical
form
for
the
multitude
upon
whom
the
effect
is
to
be
produced
a
plain
translation
always
remains
the
best
those
critical
translations
which
vie
with
the
original
really
only
seem
to
amuse
the
learned
among
themselves
influence
of
shakspeare
and
thus
in
our
strasburg
society
did
shakspeare
translated
and
in
the
original
by
fragments
and
as
a
whole
by
passages
and
by
extracts
influence
us
in
such
a
manner
that
as
there
are
men
so
did
we
gradually
make
ourselves
firm
in
shakspeare
imitated
in
our
conversations
those
virtues
and
defects
of
his
time
with
which
he
had
made
us
so
well
acquainted
took
the
greatest
delight
in
his
quibbles
and
by
translating
them
nay
with
original
recklessness
sought
to
emulate
him
to
this
the
fact
that
i
had
seized
upon
him
above
all
with
great
enthusiasm
did
not
a
little
contribute
a
happy
confession
that
something
higher
waved
over
me
was
infectious
for
my
friends
who
all
resigned
themselves
to
this
mode
of
thought
we
did
not
deny
the
possibility
of
knowing
such
merits
more
closely
of
comprehending
them
of
judging
them
with
penetration
but
this
we
reserved
for
later
epochs
at
present
we
only
wished
to
sympathize
gladly
and
to
imitate
with
spirit
and
while
we
had
so
much
enjoyment
we
did
not
wish
to
inquire
and
haggle
about
the
man
who
afforded
it
but
unconditionally
to
revere
him
lenz
if
any
one
would
learn
immediately
what
was
thought
talked
about
and
discussed
in
this
lively
society
let
him
read
herder
essay
on
shakspeare
in
the
part
of
his
works
upon
the
german
manner
and
art

and
also

the

which
a
translation
of
labour
was
added

penetrates
into
the
deepest
interior
of
shakspeare
nature
and
exhibits
it
nobly
lenz
conducts
himself
more
like
an
iconoclast
against
the
traditions
of
the
theatre
and
will
have
everything
everywhere
treated
in
shakspeare
manner
since
i
have
had
occasion
to
mention
this
clever
and
eccentric
man
here
it
is
the
place
to
say
something
about
him
by
way
of
experiment
i
did
not
become
acquainted
with
him
till
towards
the
end
of
my
residence
at
strasburg
we
saw
each
other
seldom
his
company
was
not
mine
but
we
sought
an
opportunity
of
meeting
and
willingly
communicated
with
each
other
because
as
contemporary
youths
we
harboured
similar
views
he
had
a
small
but
neat
figure
a
charming
little
head
to
the
elegant
form
of
which
his
delicate
but
somewhat
flat
features
perfectly
corresponded
blue
eyes
blond
hair
in
short
a
person
such
as
i
have
from
time
to
time
met
among
northern
youths
a
soft
and
as
it
were
cautious
step
a
pleasant
but
not
quite
flowing
speech
and
a
conduct
which
fluctuating
between
reserve
and
shyness
well
became
a
young
man
small
poems
especially
his
own
he
read
very
well
aloud
for
his
turn
of
mind
i
only
know
the
english
word
whimsical
which
as
the
dictionary
shows
comprises
very
many
singularities
under
one
notion
no
one
perhaps
was
more
capable
than
he
to
feel
and
imitate
the
extravagances
and
excrescences
of
shakspeare
genius
to
this
the
translation
above
mentioned
bears
witness
he
treated
his
author
with
great
freedom
was
not
in
the
least
close
and
faithful
but
he
knew
how
to
put
on
the
armour
or
rather
the
motley
jacket
of
his
predecessor
so
very
well
to
adapt
himself
with
such
humour
to
his
gestures
that
he
was
certain
to
obtain
applause
from
those
who
were
interested
in
such
matters
the
absurdities
of
the
clowns
especially
constituted
our
whole
happiness
and
we
praised
lenz
as
a
favoured
man
when
he
succeeded
in
rendering
as
follows
the
epitaph
on
the

shot

the

tendency
towards
the
absurd
which
displays
itself
free
and
unfettered
in
youth
but
afterwards
recedes
more
into
the
background
without
being
on
that
account
utterly
lost
was
in
full
bloom
among
us
and
we
sought
even
by
original
jests
to
celebrate
our
great
master
we
were
very
proud
when
we
could
lay
before
the
company
something
of
the
kind
which
was
in
any
degree
approved
as
for
instance
the
following
on
a
who
had
been
hurt
on
a
wild
horse
a
rider
in
this
house
you
find

master
too
is

master
of

wis
full
well
he
bears
the
name
but
if
the
ride
the
master
is
on
him
and
his
be
shame
about
such
things
serious
discussions
were
held
as
to
whether
they
were
worthy
of
the
clown
or
not
whether
they
flowed
from
the
genuine
pure
fool
spring
and
whether
sense
and
understanding
had
at
all
mingled
in
an
unfitting
and
inadmissible
manner
altogether
our
singular
views
were
diffused
with
the
greater
ardour
and
more
persons
were
in
a
position
to
sympathize
with
them
as
lessing
in
whom
great
confidence

placed

properly
speaking
given
the
first
signal
in
his
in
a
society
so
attuned
and
excited
i
managed
to
take
many
a
pleasant
excursion
into
upper
alsace
whence
however
on
this
very
account
i
brought
back
no
particular
instruction
the
number
of
little
verses
which
flowed
from
us
on
that
occasion
and
which
might
serve
to
adorn
a
lively
description
of
a
journey

lost
in
the
of
molsheim
abbey
we
admired
the
painted
windows
in
the
fertile
spot
between
colmar
and
schlettstadt
resounded
some
comic
hymns
to
ceres
the
consumption
of
so
many
fruits
being
circumstantially
set
forth
and
extolled
and
the
important
question
as
to
the
free
or
restricted
trade
in
them
being
very
merrily
taken
up
at
ensisheim
we
saw
the
monstrous
aerolite
hanging
up
in
the
church
and
in
accordance
with
the
scepticism
of
the
time
ridiculed
the
credulity
of
man
never
suspecting
that
such
beings
if
they
were
not
to
fall
into
our
were
at
any
rate
to
be
preserved
in
our
cabinets
the
ottilienberg
of
a
pilgrimage
to
the
ottilienberg
accomplished
with
an
hundred
nay
a
thousand
of
the
faithful
i
still
love
to
think
here
where
the
of
a
roman
castle
still
remained
a
count
beautiful
daughter
of
a
pious
disposition
was
said
to
have
dwelt
among
ruins
and
stony
crevices
near
the
chapel
where
the
wanderers
edify
themselves
her
well
is
shown
and
much
that
is
beautiful
is
narrated
the
image
which
i
formed
of
her
and
her
name
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
i
carried
both
about
with
me
for
a
long
time
until
at
last
i
endowed
with
them
one
of
my
later
but
not
less
beloved
daughters
who
was
so
favourably
received
by
pure
and
pious
hearts
on
this
eminence
also
is
repeated
to
the
eye
the
majestic
alsace
always
the
same
and
always
new
just
as
in
an
amphitheatre
let
one
take
one
place
where
one
will
one
surveys
the
whole
people
but
sees
one
neighbours
the
plainest
so
it
is
here
with
bushes
rocks
hills
woods
fields
meadows
and
districts
near
and
in
the
distance
they
wished
to
show
us
even
basle
in
the
horizon
that
we
saw
it
i
will
not
swear
but
the
remote
blue
of
the
swiss
mountains
even
here
exercised
its
rights
over
us
by
summoning
us
to
itself
and
since
we
could
not
follow
the
impulse
by
leaving
a
painful
feeling
to
such
distractions
and
cheerful
recreations
i
abandoned
myself
the
more
readily
and
even
with
a
degree
of
intoxication
because
my
passionate
connexion
with
frederica
now
began
to
trouble
me
such
a
youthful
affection
cherished
at
random
may
be
compared
to
a
thrown
at
night
which
rises
with
a
soft
brilliant
track
mingles
with
the
stars
nay
for
a
moment
seems
to
pause
among
them
then
in
descending
describes
the
same
path
in
the
reverse
direction
and
at
last
brings
destruction
to
the
place
where
it
has
terminated
its
course
frederica
always
remained
equal
to
herself
she
seemed
not
to
think
nor
to
wish
to
think
that
the
connexion
would
so
soon
terminate
olivia
on
the
contrary
who
indeed
also
missed
me
with
regret
but
nevertheless
did
not
lose
so
much
as
the
other
had
more
foresight
or
was
more
open
she
often
spoke
to
me
about
my
probable
departure
and
sought
to
console
herself
both
on
her
own
and
her
sister
account
a
girl
who
renounces
a
man
to
whom
she
has
not
denied
her
affections
is
far
from
being
in
that
painful
situation
in
which
a
youth
finds
himself
who
has
gone
so
far
in
his
declarations
to
a
lady
he
always
plays
a
pitiful
part
since
a
certain
survey
of
his
situation
is
expected
of
him
as
a
growing
man
and
a
decided
levity
does
not
suit
him
the
reasons
of
a
girl
who
draws
back
always
seem
sufficient
those
of
a
man
never
but
how
should
a
flattering
passion
allow
us
to
foresee
whither
it
may
lead
us
for
even
when
we
have
quite
sensibly
renounced
it
we
can
not
get
rid
of
it
we
take
pleasure
in
the
charming
habit
even
if
this
is
to
be
in
an
altered
manner
thus
it
was
with
me
although
the
presence
of
frederica
pained
me
i
knew
of
nothing
more
pleasant
than
to
think
of
her
while
absent
and
to
converse
with
her
i
went
to
see
her
less
frequently
but
our
correspondence
became
so
much
the
more
animated
she
knew
how
to
bring
before
me
her
situation
with
cheerfulness
her
feelings
with
grace
and
i
called
her
merits
to
mind
with
fervour
and
with
passion
absence
made
me
free
and
my
whole
affection
first
truly
bloomed
by
this
communication
in
the
distance
at
such
moments
i
could
quite
blind
myself
as
to
the
future
and
was
sufficiently
distracted
by
the
progress
of
time
and
of
pressing
business
i
had
hitherto
made
it
possible
to
do
the
most
various
things
by
always
taking
a
lively
interest
in
what
was
present
and
belonged
to
the
immediate
moment
but
towards
the
end
all
became
too
much
crowded
together
as
is
always
the
case
when
one
is
to
free
oneself
from
a
place
one
more
event
which
happened
in
an
interval
took
from
me
the
last
days
i
found
myself
in
a
respectable
society
at
a
whence
there
was
a
noble
view
of
the
front
of
the
minster
and
the
tower
which
rises
over
it
it
is
a
pity
said
some
one
that
the
whole
was
not
finished
and
that
we
have
only
one
tower
it
is
just
as
unpleasant
to
me
answered
i
to
see
this
one
tower
not
quite
completed
for
the
four
volutes
leave
off
much
too
bluntly
there
should
have
been
upon
them
four
light
spires
with
a
higher
one
in
the
middle
where
the
clumsy
cross
is
standing
when
i
had
expressed
this
strong
opinion
with
my
accustomed
animation
a
little
lively
man
addressed
me
and
asked
who
told
you
so
the
tower
itself
i
replied
i
have
observed
it
so
long
and
so
attentively
and
have
shown
it
so
much
affection
that
it
at
last
resolved
to
make
me
this
open
confession
it
has
not
misinformed
you
answered
he
i
am
the
best
judge
of
that
for
i
am
the
person
officially
placed
over
the
public
edifices
we
still
have
among
our
archives
the
original
sketches
which
say
the
same
thing
and
which
i
can
show
to
you
on
account
of
my
speedy
departure
i
pressed
him
to
show
me
this
kindness
as
speedily
as
possible
he
let
me
see
the
precious
rolls
i
soon
with
the
help
of
oiled
paper
drew
the
spires
which
were
wanting
in
the
building
as
executed
and
regretted
that
i
had
not
been
sooner
informed
of
this
treasure
but
this
was
always
to
be
the
case
with
me
that
by
looking
at
things
and
considering
them
i
should
first
attain
a
conception
which
perhaps
would
not
have
been
so
striking
and
so
fruitful
if
it
had
been
given
ready
made
strasburg
minster
amid
all
this
pressure
and
confusion
i
could
not
fail
to
see
frederica
once
more
those
were
painful
days
the
memory
of
which
has
not
remained
with
me
when
i
reached
her
my
hand
from
my
horse
the
tears
stood
in
her
eyes
and
i
felt
very
uneasy
i
now
rode
along
the
footpath
towards
drusenheim
and
here
one
of
the
most
singular
forebodings
took
possession
of
me
i
saw
not
with
the
eyes
of
the
body
but
with
those
of
the
mind
my
own
figure
coming
towards
me
on
horseback
and
on
the
same
road
attired
in
a
dress
which
i
had
never
worn
it
was
with
somewhat
of
gold
as
soon
as
i
shook
myself
out
of
this
dream
the
figure
had
entirely
disappeared
it
is
strange
however
that
eight
years
afterwards
i
found
myself
on
the
very
road
to
pay
one
more
visit
to
frederica
in
the
dress
of
which
i
had
dreamed
and
which
i
wore
not
from
choice
but
by
accident
however
it
may
be
with
matters
of
this
kind
generally
this
strange
illusion
in
some
measure
calmed
me
at
the
moment
of
parting
the
pain
of
quitting
for
ever
the
noble
alsace
with
all
that
i
had
gained
in
it
was
softened
and
having
at
last
escaped
the
excitement
of
a
farewell
i
found
myself
on
a
peaceful
and
quiet
journey
pretty
well
recovered
arrived
at
mannheim
i
hastened
with
great
eagerness
to
see
the
hall
of
antiquities
of
which
a
great
boast
was
made
even
at
leipzig
on
the
occasion
of
winckelmann
and
lessing
writings
i
had
heard
much
said
of
those
important
works
of
art
but
so
much
the
less
had
i
seen
them
for
except
laocoön
the
father
and
the
faun
with
the
crotola
there
were
no
casts
in
the
academy
and
whatever
oeser
chose
to
say
to
us
on
the
subject
of
those
works
was
enigmatical
enough
how
can
a
conception
of
the
end
of
art
be
given
to
beginners
director
verschaffel
reception
was
kind
i
was
conducted
to
the
saloon
by
one
of
his
associates
who
after
he
had
opened
it
for
me
left
me
to
my
own
inclinations
and
reflections
here
i
now
stood
open
to
the
most
wonderful
impressions
in
a
spacious
and
with
its
extraordinary
height
almost
cubical
saloon
in
a
space
well
lighted
from
above
by
the
windows
under
the
cornice
with
the
noblest
statues
of
antiquity
not
only
ranged
along
the
walls
but
also
set
up
one
with
another
over
the
whole
area
a
forest
of
statues
through
which
one
was
forced
to
wind
a
great
ideal
popular
assembly
through
which
one
was
forced
to
press
all
these
noble
figures
could
by
opening
and
closing
the
curtains
be
placed
in
the
most
advantageous
light
and
besides
this
they
were
moveable
on
their
pedestals
and
could
be
turned
about
at
pleasure
after
i
had
for
a
time
sustained
the
first
impression
of
this
irresistible
mass
i
turned
to
those
figures
which
attracted
me
the
most
and
who
can
deny
that
the
apollo
belvidere
with
his
colossal
stature
his
slender
build
his
free
movement
his
conquering
glance
carried
off
the
victory
over
our
feelings
in
preference
to
all
the
others
i
then
turned
to
laocoön
whom
i
here
saw
for
the
first
time
in
connexion
with
his
sons
i
brought
to
mind
as
well
as
possible
the
discussions
and
contests
which
had
been
held
concerning
him
and
tried
to
get
a
point
of
view
of
my
own
but
i
was
now
drawn
this
way
now
that
the
dying
gladiator
long
held
me
fast
but
the
group
of
castor
and
pollux
that
precious
though
problematical
relic
i
had
especially
to
thank
for
my
happiest
moments
i
did
not
know
how
impossible
it
was
at
once
to
account
to
oneself
for
a
sight
affording
enjoyment
i
forced
myself
to
reflect
and
little
as
i
succeeded
in
attaining
any
sort
of
clearness
i
felt
that
every
individual
figure
from
this
great
assembled
mass
was
comprehensible
that
every
object
was
natural
and
significant
in
itself
antiquities
at
mannheim
nevertheless
my
chief
attention
was
directed
to
laocoön
and
i
decided
for
myself
the
famous
question
why
he
did
not
shriek
by
declaring
to
myself
that
he
could
not
shriek
all
the
actions
and
movements
of
the
three
figures
proceeded
according
to
my
view
from
the
first
conception
of
the
group
the
whole
position
as
forcible
as
artistical
the
chief
body
was
composed
with
reference
to
two
impulses
the
struggle
against
the
snakes
and
the
flight
from
the
momentary
bite
to
soften
this
pain
the
abdomen
must
be
drawn
in
and
shrieking
rendered
impossible
thus
i
also
decided
that
the
younger
son
was
not
bitten
and
in
other
respects
sought
to
elicit
the
artistical
merits
of
this
group
i
wrote
a
letter
on
the
subject
to
oeser
who
however
did
not
show
any
special
esteem
for
my
interpretation
but
only
replied
to
my
good
will
with
general
terms
of
encouragement
i
was
however
fortunate
enough
to
retain
that
thought
and
to
allow
it
to
repose
in
me
for
several
years
until
it
was
at
last
annexed
to
the
whole
body
of
my
experiences
and
convictions
in
which
sense
i
afterwards
gave
it
in
editing
my
after
a
zealous
contemplation
of
so
many
sublime
plastic
works
i
was
not
to
want
a
foretaste
of
antique
architecture
i
found
the
cast
of
a
capital
of
the
rotunda
and
do
not
deny
that
at
the
sight
of
those
as
huge
as
they
were
elegant
my
faith
in
the
northern
architecture
began
somewhat
to
waver
this
early
sight
although
so
great
and
so
effective
throughout
my
whole
life
was
nevertheless
attended
with
but
small
results
in
the
time
immediately
following
how
willingly
would
i
have
begun
a
book
instead
of
ending
one
with
describing
it
for
no
sooner
was
the
door
of
the
noble
saloon
closed
behind
me
than
i
wished
to
recover
myself
again
nay
i
rather
sought
to
remove
those
forms
as
cumbersome
from
my
memory
and
it
was
only
by
a
long
circuitous
route
that
i
was
brought
back
into
this
sphere
however
the
quiet
fruitfulness
is
quite
inestimable
of
those
impressions
which
are
received
with
enjoyment
and
without
dissecting
judgment
youth
is
capable
of
this
highest
happiness
if
it
will
not
be
critical
but
allows
the
excellent
and
the
good
to
act
upon
it
without
investigation
and
division

the
wanderer
had
now
at
last
reached
home
more
healthy
and
cheerful
than
on
the
first
occasion
but
still
in
his
whole
being
there
appeared
something
which
did
not
fully
indicate
mental
health
at
the
very
first
i
put
my
mother
into
the
position
that
between
my
father
sincere
spirit
of
order
and
my
own
various
eccentricities
she
was
forced
to
occupy
herself
with
bringing
passing
events
into
a
certain
medium
at
mayence
a
boy
had
so
well
pleased
me
that
as
the
fair
was
close
at
hand
i
invited
him
to
frankfort
and
promised
to
give
him
lodging
and
to
encourage
him
in
this
occurrence
appeared
once
more
that
peculiarity
which
has
cost
me
so
much
in
my
lifetime
namely
that
i
liked
to
see
younger
people
gather
round
me
and
attach
themselves
to
me
by
which
indeed
i
am
at
last
encumbered
with
their
fate
one
unpleasant
experience
after
another
could
not
reclaim
me
from
this
innate
impulse
which
even
at
present
and
in
spite
of
the
clearest
conviction
threatens
from
time
to
time
to
lead
me
astray
my
mother
clearer
than
myself
plainly
foresaw
how
strange
it
would
appear
to
my
father
if
a
musical
went
from
such
a
respectable
house
to
taverns
and
to
earn
his
bread
hence
she
provided
him
with
board
and
lodging
in
the
neighbourhood
i
recommended
him
to
my
friends
and
thus
the
lad
did
not
fare
badly
after
several
years
i
saw
him
again
when
he
had
grown
taller
and
more
clumsy
without
having
advanced
much
in
his
art
the
good
lady
well
contented
with
this
first
attempt
at
squaring
and
hushing
up
did
not
think
that
this
art
would
immediately
become
completely
necessary
to
her
my
father
leading
a
contented
life
amid
his
old
tastes
and
occupations
was
comfortable
like
one
who
in
spite
of
all
hindrances
and
delays
carries
out
his
plans
i
had
now
gained
my
degree
and
the
first
step
to
the
further
graduating
course
of
was
taken
my
had
obtained
his
applause
a
further
examination
of
it
and
many
a
preparation
for
a
future
edition
gave
him
occupation
during
my
residence
in
alsace
i
had
written
many
little
poems
essays
notes
on
travel
and
several
loose
sheets
he
found
amusement
in
bringing
these
under
heads
in
arranging
them
and
in
devising
their
completion
and
was
delighted
with
the
expectation
that
my
hitherto
insuperable
dislike
to
see
any
of
these
things
printed
would
soon
cease
my
sister
had
collected
around
her
a
circle
of
intelligent
and
amiable
women
without
being
domineering
she
domineered
over
all
as
her
good
understanding
could
overlook
much
and
her
could
often
accommodate
matters
moreover
she
was
in
the
position
of
playing
the
confidant
rather
than
the
rival
of
my
older
friends
and
companions
i
found
in
horn
the
unalterably
true
friend
and
cheerful
associate
i
also
became
intimate
with
riese
who
did
not
fail
to
practise
and
try
my
acuteness
by
opposing
with
a
persevering
contradiction
doubt
and
negation
to
a
dogmatic
enthusiasm
into
which
i
too
readily
fell
others
by
degrees
entered
into
this
circle
whom
i
shall
afterwards
mention
but
among
the
persons
who
rendered
my
new
residence
in
my
native
city
pleasant
and
profitable
the
brothers
schlosser
certainly
stood
at
the
head
the
elder
heronymus
a
profound
and
elegant
jurist
enjoyed
universal
confidence
as
counsellor
his
favourite
abode
was
amongst
his
books
and
papers
in
rooms
where
the
greatest
order
prevailed
there
i
have
never
found
him
otherwise
than
cheerful
and
sympathising
in
a
larger
society
also
he
showed
himself
agreeable
and
entertaining
for
his
mind
by
extensive
reading
was
adorned
with
all
the
beauty
of
antiquity
he
did
not
on
occasion
disdain
to
increase
the
social
pleasures
by
agreeable
latin
poems
and
i
still
possess
several
sportive
distiches
which
he
wrote
under
some
portraits
drawn
by
me
of
strange
and
generally
known
frankfort
caricatures
often
i
consulted
with
him
as
to
the
course
of
life
and
business
i
was
now
commencing
and
if
an
hundredfold
inclinations
and
passions
had
not
torn
me
from
this
path
he
would
have
been
my
surest
guide
nearer
to
me
in
point
of
age
was
his
brother
george
who
had
again
returned
from
treptow
from
the
service
of
the
duke
eugene
of
würtemberg
while
he
had
advanced
in
knowledge
of
the
world
and
in
practical
talent
he
had
not
remained
behindhand
in
a
survey
of
german
and
foreign
literature
he
liked
as
before
to
write
in
all
languages
but
did
not
further
excite
me
in
this
respect
as
i
devoted
myself
exclusively
to
german
and
only
cultivated
other
languages
so
far
as
to
enable
me
in
some
measure
to
read
the
best
authors
in
the
original
his
honesty
showed
itself
the
same
as
ever
nay
his
acquaintance
with
the
world
may
have
occasioned
him
to
adhere
with
more
severity
and
even
obstinacy
to
his
views
merk
through
these
two
friends
i
very
soon
became
acquainted
with
merck
to
whom
i
had
not
been
unfavourably
announced
by
herder
from
strasburg
this
strange
man
who
had
the
greatest
influence
on
my
life
was
a
native
of
darmstadt
of
his
early
education
i
can
say
but
little
after
finishing
his
studies
he
conducted
a
young
man
to
switzerland
where
he
remained
for
some
time
and
came
back
married
when
i
made
his
acquaintance
he
was
military
paymaster
at
darmstadt
born
with
mind
and
understanding
he
had
acquired
much
elegant
knowledge
especially
in
modern
literature
and
had
paid
attention
to
all
times
and
places
in
the
history
of
the
world
and
of
man
he
had
the
talent
of
judging
with
certainty
and
acuteness
he
was
prized
as
a
thorough
decisive
man
of
business
and
a
ready
accountant
with
ease
he
gained
an
entrance
everywhere
as
a
very
pleasant
companion
for
those
to
whom
he
had
not
rendered
himself
formidable
by
sarcasms
his
figure
was
long
and
lean
a
sharp
prominent
nose
was
remarkable
light
blue
perhaps
grey
eyes
gave
something
to
his
glance
which
wandered
attentively
here
and
there
lavater
has
preserved
his
profile
for
us
in
his
character
there
was
a
wonderful
contradiction
by
nature
a
good
noble
upright
man
he
had
embittered
himself
against
the
world
and
allowed
this
morbid
whim
to
sway
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
felt
an
irresistible
inclination
to
be
wilfully
a
rogue
or
even
a
villain
sensible
quiet
kind
at
one
moment
it
might
strike
him
in
the
next
as
a
snail
puts
out
his
horns
to
do
something
which
might
hurt
wound
or
even
injure
another
yet
as
one
readily
associates
with
something
dangerous
when
one
believes
oneself
safe
from
it
i
felt
so
much
the
greater
inclination
to
live
with
him
and
to
enjoy
his
good
qualities
since
a
confident
feeling
allowed
me
to
suspect
that
he
would
not
turn
his
bad
side
towards
me
while
now
by
this
morally
restless
mind
by
this
necessity
of
treating
men
in
a
malignant
and
spiteful
way
he
on
one
side
destroyed
social
life
another
disquiet
which
also
he
very
carefully
fostered
within
himself
opposed
his
internal
comfort
namely
he
felt
a
certain
impulse
to
production
in
which
he
indulged
the
more
readily
as
he
expressed
himself
easily
and
happily
in
prose
and
verse
and
might
well
venture
to
play
a
part
among
the
of
the
time
i
myself
still
possess
poetical
epistles
full
of
uncommon
boldness
force
and
gall
which
are
highly
remarkable
from
their
original
views
of
persons
and
things
but
are
at
the
same
time
written
with
such
wounding
power
that
i
could
not
publish
them
even
at
present
but
must
either
destroy
them
or
preserve
them
for
posterity
as
striking
documents
of
the
secret
discord
in
our
literature
however
the
fact
that
in
all
his
labours
he
went
to
work
negatively
and
destructively
was
unpleasant
to
himself
and
he
often
declared
that
he
envied
me
that
innocent
love
of
setting
forth
a
subject
which
arose
from
the
pleasure
i
took
both
in
the
original
and
the
imitation
for
the
rest
his
literary
would
have
been
rather
useful
than
injurious
to
him
if
he
had
not
felt
an
irresistible
impulse
to
enter
also
into
the
technical
and
mercantile
department
for
when
he
once
began
to
curse
his
faculties
and
was
beside
himself
that
he
could
not
with
sufficient
genius
satisfy
his
claims
to
a
practical
talent
he
gave
up
now
plastic
art
now
poetry
and
thought
of
mercantile
and
manufacturing
undertakings
which
were
to
bring
in
money
while
they
afforded
him
amusement
in
darmstadt
there
was
besides
a
society
of
very
cultivated
men
privy
councillor
von
hess
minister
of
the
landgrave
professor
petersen
rector
wenk
and
others
were
the
naturalized
persons
whose
worth
attracted
by
turns
many
neighbours
from
other
parts
and
many
travellers
through
the
city
the
wife
of
the
privy
councillor
and
her
sister
demoiselle
flachsland
were
ladies
of
uncommon
merit
and
talents
the
latter
who
was
betrothed
to
herder
being
doubly
interesting
from
her
own
qualities
and
her
attachment
to
so
excellent
a
man
how
much
i
was
animated
and
advanced
by
this
circle
is
not
to
be
expressed
they
readily
heard
me
read
aloud
my
completed
or
begun
works
they
encouraged
me
when
i
openly
and
circumstantially
told
what
i
was
then
planning
and
blamed
me
when
on
every
new
occasion
i
laid
aside
what
i
had
already
commenced
had
already
advanced
von
was
gradually
building
itself
up
in
my
mind
the
study
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
occupied
me
and
the
minster
had
left
in
me
a
very
serious
impression
which
could
well
stand
as
a
background
to
such
poetical
inventions
paper
on
german
architecture
what
i
had
thought
and
imagined
with
respect
to
that
style
of
architecture
i
wrote
in
a
connected
form
the
first
point
on
which
i
insisted
was
that
it
should
be
called
german
and
not
gothic
that
it
should
be
considered
not
foreign
but
native
the
second
point
was
that
it
could
not
be
compared
with
the
architecture
of
the
greeks
and
romans
because
it
sprang
from
quite
another
principle
if
these
living
under
a
more
favourable
sky
allowed
their
roof
to
rest
upon
columns
a
wall
broken
through
arose
of
its
own
accord
we
however
who
must
always
protect
ourselves
against
the
weather
and
everywhere
surround
ourselves
with
walls
have
to
revere
the
genius
who
discovered
the
means
of
endowing
massive
walls
with
variety
of
apparently
breaking
them
through
and
of
thus
occupying
the
eye
in
a
worthy
and
pleasing
manner
on
the
broad
surface
the
same
principle
applied
to
the
steeples
which
are
not
like
cupolas
to
form
a
heaven
within
but
to
strive
towards
heaven
without
and
to
announce
to
the
countries
far
around
the
existence
of
the
sanctuary
which
lies
at
their
base
the
interior
of
these
venerable
piles
i
only
ventured
to
touch
by
poetical
contemplation
and
a
pious
tone
if
i
had
been
pleased
to
write
down
these
views
the
value
of
which
i
will
not
deny
clearly
and
distinctly
in
an
intelligible
style
the
paper
on
german
architecture
i
m
ervini
a
steinback
would
then
when
i
published
it
have
produced
more
effect
and
would
sooner
have
drawn
the
attention
of
the
native
friends
of
art
but
misled
by
the
example
of
herder
and
hamann
i
obscured
these
very
simple
thoughts
and
observations
by
a
dusty
cloud
of
words
and
phrases
and
both
for
myself
and
others
darkened
the
light
which
had
arisen
within
me
however
the
paper
was
well
received
and
reprinted
in
herder
work
on
german
manner
and
art
if
now
partly
from
inclination
partly
with
poetical
and
other
views
i
very
readily
occupied
myself
with
the
antiquities
of
my
country
and
sought
to
render
them
present
to
my
mind
i
was
from
time
to
time
distracted
from
this
subject
by
biblical
studies
and
religious
sympathies
since
luther
life
and
deeds
which
shine
forth
so
magnificently
in
the
sixteenth
century
always
necessarily
brought
me
back
to
the
holy
scriptures
and
to
the
observation
of
religious
feelings
and
opinions
to
look
upon
the
bible
as
a
work
of
compilation
which
had
gradually
arisen
and
had
been
elaborated
at
different
times
was
flattering
to
my
little
since
this
view
was
then
by
no
means
predominant
much
less
was
it
received
in
the
circle
in
which
i
lived
with
respect
to
the
chief
sense
i
adhered
to
luther
expression
in
matters
of
detail
i
went
to
schmidt
literal
translation
and
sought
to
use
my
little
hebrew
as
well
as
possible
that
there
are
contradictions
in
the
bible
no
one
will
now
deny
these
they
sought
to
reconcile
by
laying
down
the
plainest
passage
as
a
foundation
and
endeavouring
to
assimilate
to
that
those
that
were
contradictory
and
less
clear
i
on
the
contrary
wished
to
find
out
by
examination
what
passage
best
expressed
the
sense
of
the
matter
to
this
i
adhered
and
rejected
the
rest
as
interpolated
for
a
fundamental
opinion
had
already
confirmed
itself
in
me
without
my
being
able
to
say
whether
it
had
been
imparted
to
me
or
had
been
excited
in
me
or
had
arisen
from
my
own
reflection
it
was
this
that
in
anything
which
is
handed
down
to
us
especially
in
writing
the
real
point
is
the
ground
the
interior
the
sense
the
tendency
of
the
work
that
here
lies
the
original
the
divine
the
effective
the
intact
the
indestructible
and
that
no
time
no
external
operation
or
condition
can
in
any
degree
affect
this
internal
primeval
nature
at
least
no
more
than
the
sickness
of
the
body
affects
a
soul
thus
according
to
my
view
the
language
the
dialect
the
peculiarity
the
style
and
finally
the
writing
were
to
be
regarded
as
the
body
of
every
work
of
mind
this
body
although
nearly
enough
akin
to
the
internal
was
yet
exposed
to
deterioration
and
corruption
as
indeed
altogether
no
tradition
can
be
given
quite
pure
according
to
its
nature
nor
indeed
if
one
were
given
pure
could
it
be
perfectly
intelligible
at
every
following
period
the
former
on
account
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
organs
through
which
the
tradition
is
made
the
latter
on
account
of
the
difference
of
time
and
place
but
specially
the
diversify
of
human
capacities
and
modes
of
thought
for
which
reason
the
interpreters
themselves
never
agree
hence
it
is
everybody
duty
to
seek
out
for
what
is
internal
and
peculiar
in
a
book
which
particularly
interests
us
and
at
the
same
time
above
all
things
to
weigh
in
what
relation
it
stands
to
our
own
inner
nature
and
how
far
by
that
vitality
our
own
is
excited
and
rendered
fruitful
on
the
other
hand
everything
external
that
is
ineffective
with
respect
to
ourselves
or
is
subject
to
a
doubt
is
to
be
consigned
over
to
criticism
which
even
if
it
should
be
able
to
dislocate
and
dismember
the
whole
would
never
succeed
in
depriving
us
of
the
only
ground
to
which
we
hold
fast
nor
even
in
perplexing
us
for
a
moment
with
respect
to
our
once
formed
confidence
study
of
the
bible
this
conviction
sprung
from
faith
and
sight
which
in
all
cases
that
we
recognise
as
the
most
important
is
applicable
and
strengthening
lies
at
the
foundation
of
the
moral
as
well
as
the
literary
edifice
of
my
life
and
is
to
be
regarded
as
a
and
richly
productive
capital
although
in
particular
cases
we
may
be
seduced
into
making
an
erroneous
application
by
this
notion
the
bible
first
became
really
accessible
to
me
i
had
as
is
the
case
in
the
religious
instruction
of
protestants
run
through
it
several
times
nay
had
made
myself
acquainted
with
it
by
way
of
leaps
from
beginning
to
end
and
back
again
the
blunt
naturalness
of
the
old
testament
and
the
tender
of
the
new
had
attracted
me
in
particular
instances
as
a
whole
indeed
it
never
properly
appealed
to
me
but
now
the
diverse
characters
of
the
different
books
no
more
perplexed
me
i
knew
how
to
represent
to
myself
their
significance
faithfully
and
in
proper
order
and
had
too
much
feeling
for
the
book
to
be
ever
able
to
do
without
it
by
this
very
side
of
feeling
i
was
protected
against
all
scoffing
because
i
saw
its
dishonesty
at
once
i
not
only
detested
it
but
could
even
fall
in
a
rage
about
it
and
i
still
perfectly
remember
that
in
my
childishly
fanatical
zeal
i
should
have
completely
throttled
voltaire
on
account
of
his
if
i
could
only
have
got
at
him
on
the
other
hand
every
kind
of
honest
investigation
pleased
me
greatly
the
revelations
as
to
the
locality
and
costume
of
the
east
which
diffused
more
and
more
light
i
received
with
joy
and
continued
to
exercise
all
my
acuteness
on
such
valuable
traditions
it
is
known
that
at
an
earlier
period
i
sought
to
initiate
myself
into
the
situation
of
the
world
as
described
to
us
by
the
first
book
of
moses
as
i
now
thought
to
proceed
stepwise
and
in
proper
order
i
seized
after
a
long
interruption
on
the
second
book
but
what
a
difference
just
as
the
fulness
of
childhood
had
vanished
from
my
life
so
did
i
find
the
second
book
separated
from
the
first
by
a
monstrous
chasm
the
utter
forgetfulness
of
a
bygone
time
is
already
expressed
in
the
few
important
words
now
there
arose
a
new
king
over
egypt
which
knew
not
joseph
but
the
people
also
innumerable
as
the
stars
of
heaven
had
almost
forgotten
the
ancestor
to
whom
under
the
starry
heaven
jehovah
had
made
the
very
promise
which
was
now
fulfilled
i
worked
through
the
five
books
with
unspeakable
trouble
and
insufficient
means
and
powers
and
in
doing
this
fell
upon
the
strangest
notions
i
thought
i
had
discovered
that
it
was
not
our
ten
commandments
which
stood
upon
the
tables
that
the
israelites
did
not
wander
through
the
desert
for
forty
years
but
only
for
a
short
time
and
thus
i
fancied
that
i
could
give
entirely
new
revelations
as
to
the
character
of
moses
even
the
new
testament
was
not
safe
from
my
inquiries
with
my
passion
for
dissection
i
did
not
spare
it
but
with
love
and
affection
i
chimed
in
with
that
wholesome
word
the
evangelists
may
contradict
each
other
provided
only
the
gospel
does
not
contradict
itself
in
this
region
also
i
thought
i
should
make
all
sorts
of
discoveries
that
gift
of
tongues
imparted
at
pentecost
with
lustre
and
clearness
i
interpreted
for
myself
in
a
somewhat
abstruse
manner
not
adapted
to
procure
many
adherents
into
one
of
the
chief
lutheran
doctrines
which
has
been
still
more
sharpened
by
the
hernhuters
namely
that
of
regarding
the
sinful
principle
as
predominant
in
man
i
endeavoured
to
accommodate
myself
but
without
remarkable
success
nevertheless
i
had
made
the
terminology
of
this
doctrine
tolerably
my
own
and
made
use
of
it
in
a
letter
which
in
the
character
of
country
pastor
i
was
pleased
to
send
to
a
new
brother
in
office
however
the
chief
theme
in
the
paper
was
that
watchword
of
the
time
called
toleration
which
prevailed
among
the
better
order
of
brains
and
minds
such
things
which
were
produced
by
degrees
i
had
printed
at
my
own
cost
in
the
following
year
to
try
myself
with
the
public
made
presents
of
them
or
sent
them
to
eichenberg
shop
in
order
to
get
rid
of
them
as
fast
as
possible
without
deriving
any
profit
myself
here
and
there
a
review
mentions
them
now
favourably
now
unfavourably
but
they
soon
passed
away
my
father
kept
them
carefully
in
his
archives
otherwise
i
should
not
have
possessed
a
copy
of
them
i
shall
add
these
as
well
as
some
things
of
the
kind
which
i
have
found
to
the
new
edition
of
my
works
hamann
since
i
had
really
been
seduced
into
the
sybilline
style
of
such
papers
as
well
as
into
the
publication
of
them
by
hamann
this
seems
to
me
a
proper
place
to
make
mention
of
this
worthy
and
influential
man
who
was
then
as
great
a
mystery
to
us
as
he
has
always
remained
to
his
native
country
his
was
more
especially
liked
by
those
persons
who
could
not
adapt
themselves
to
the
dazzling
spirit
of
the
time
it
was
suspected
that
he
was
a
profound
man
who
accurately
acquainted
with
the
public
world
and
with
literature
allowed
of
something
mysterious
and
unfathomable
and
expressed
himself
on
this
subject
in
a
manner
quite
his
own
by
those
who
then
ruled
the
literature
of
the
day
he
was
indeed
considered
an
abstruse
mystic
but
an
aspiring
youth
suffered
themselves
to
be
attracted
by
him
even
the
as
they
were
called
half
in
jest
half
in
earnest
those
pious
souls
who
without
professing
themselves
members
of
any
society
formed
an
invisible
church
turned
their
attention
to
him
while
to
my
friend
fräulein
von
klettenberg
and
no
less
to
her
friend
moser
the
magus
from
the
north
was
a
welcome
apparition
people
put
themselves
the
more
in
connexion
with
him
when
they
had
learned
that
he
was
tormented
by
narrow
domestic
circumstances
but
nevertheless
understood
how
to
maintain
this
beautiful
and
lofty
mode
of
thought
with
the
great
influence
of
president
von
moser
it
would
have
been
easy
to
provide
a
tolerable
and
convenient
existence
for
such
a
frugal
man
the
matter
was
set
on
foot
nay
so
good
an
understanding
and
mutual
approval
was
attained
that
hamann
undertook
the
long
journey
from
königsberg
to
darmstadt
but
as
the
president
happened
to
be
absent
that
odd
man
no
one
knows
on
what
account
returned
at
once
though
a
friendly
correspondence
was
kept
up
i
still
possess
two
letters
from
the
königsberger
to
his
patron
which
bear
testimony
to
the
wondrous
greatness
and
sincerity
of
their
author
but
so
good
an
understanding
was
not
to
last
long
these
pious
men
had
thought
the
other
one
pious
in
their
own
fashion
they
had
treated
him
with
reverence
as
the
magus
of
the
north
and
thought
that
he
would
continue
to
exhibit
himself
with
a
reverend
demeanour
but
already
in
the
an
of
he
had
given
some
offence
and
when
he
now
published
the
of
a
on
the
of
which
was
to
be
seen
not
only
the
of
a
horned
pan
but
also
on
one
of
the
first
pages
a
large
cock
cut
in
wood
and
setting
time
to
some
young
cockerels
who
stood
before
him
with
notes
in
their
claws
made
an
exceedingly
ridiculous
appearance
by
which
certain
of
which
the
author
did
not
approve
was
to
be
made
a
there
arose
among
and
sensitive
people
a
dissatisfaction
which
was
exhibited
to
the
author
who
not
being
edified
by
it
shunned
a
closer
connexion
our
attention
to
this
man
was
however
always
kept
alive
by
herder
who
remaining
in
correspondence
with
us
and
his
betrothed
communicated
to
us
at
once
all
that
proceeded
from
that
extraordinary
man
to
these
belonged
his
critiques
and
notices
inserted
in
the
all
of
which
bore
a
very
singular
character
i
possess
an
almost
complete
collection
of
his
works
and
a
very
important
essay
on
herder
prize
paper
concerning
the
origin
of
language
in
which
in
the
most
peculiar
manner
he
throws
flashes
of
light
upon
this
specimen
of
herder
i
do
not
give
up
the
hope
of
superintending
myself
or
at
least
furthering
an
edition
of
hamann
works
and
then
when
these
documents
are
again
before
the
public
it
will
be
time
to
speak
more
closely
of
the
author
his
nature
and
character
in
the
meanwhile
however
i
will
here
adduce
something
concerning
him
especially
as
eminent
men
are
still
living
who
felt
a
great
regard
for
him
and
whose
assent
or
correction
will
be
very
welcome
to
me
the
principle
to
which
all
hamann
expressions
may
be
referred
is
this
all
that
man
undertakes
to
perform
whether
by
deed
by
word
or
otherwise
must
proceed
from
all
his
powers
united
everything
isolated
is
worthless
a
noble
maxim
but
hard
to
follow
to
life
and
art
it
may
indeed
be
applied
but
in
every
communication
by
words
that
is
not
exactly
poetic
there
is
on
the
contrary
a
grand
difficulty
for
a
word
must
sever
itself
isolate
itself
to
say
or
signify
anything
man
while
he
speaks
must
for
the
moment
become
there
is
no
communication
no
instruction
without
severing
now
since
hamann
once
for
all
opposed
this
separation
and
because
he
felt
imagined
and
thought
in
unity
chose
to
speak
in
unity
likewise
and
to
require
the
same
of
others
he
came
into
opposition
with
his
own
style
and
with
all
that
others
produced
to
produce
the
impossible
he
therefore
grasps
at
every
element
the
deepest
and
most
mystical
contemplations
in
which
nature
and
mind
meet
each
flashes
of
the
understanding
which
beam
forth
from
such
a
contact
significant
images
which
float
in
these
regions
forcible
aphorisms
from
sacred
and
profane
writers
with
whatever
else
of
a
humorous
kind
could
be
added
all
this
forms
the
wondrous
aggregate
of
his
style
and
his
communications
if
now
one
can
not
associate
oneself
with
him
in
his
depths
can
not
wander
with
him
on
his
heights
can
not
master
the
forms
which
float
before
him
can
not
from
an
infinitely
extended
literature
exactly
find
out
the
sense
of
a
passage
which
is
only
hinted
at
we
find
that
the
more
we
study
him
the
more
dim
and
dark
it
becomes
and
this
darkness
always
increases
with
years
because
his
allusions
were
directed
to
certain
definite
peculiarities
which
prevailed
for
the
moment
in
life
and
in
literature
in
my
collection
there
are
some
of
his
printed
sheets
where
he
has
cited
with
his
own
hand
in
the
margin
the
passages
to
which
his
hints
refer
if
one
opens
them
there
is
again
a
sort
of
equivocal
double
light
which
appears
to
us
highly
agreeable
only
one
must
completely
renounce
what
is
ordinarily
called
understanding
such
leaves
merit
to
be
called
sybilline
for
this
reason
that
one
can
not
consider
them
in
and
for
themselves
but
must
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
seek
refuge
with
their
oracles
every
time
that
one
opens
them
one
fancies
one
has
found
something
new
because
the
sense
which
abides
in
every
passage
touches
and
excites
us
in
a
curious
manner
personally
i
never
saw
him
nor
did
i
hold
any
immediate
communication
with
him
by
means
of
letters
it
seems
to
me
that
he
was
extremely
clear
in
the
relations
of
life
and
friendship
and
that
he
had
a
correct
feeling
for
the
positions
of
persons
among
each
other
and
with
reference
to
himself
all
the
letters
which
i
saw
by
him
were
excellent
and
much
plainer
than
his
works
because
here
the
reference
to
time
circumstances
and
personal
affairs
was
more
clearly
prominent
i
thought
however
that
i
could
discern
this
much
generally
that
he
feeling
the
superiority
of
his
mental
gifts
in
the
most
manner
always
considered
himself
somewhat
wiser
and
more
shrewd
than
his
correspondents
whom
he
treated
rather
ironically
than
heartily
if
this
held
good
only
of
single
cases
it
applied
to
the
majority
as
far
as
my
own
observation
went
and
was
the
cause
that
i
never
felt
a
desire
to
approach
him
on
the
other
hand
a
kindly
literary
communication
between
herder
and
us
was
maintained
with
great
vivacity
though
it
was
a
pity
that
he
could
not
keep
himself
quiet
but
herder
never
left
off
his
teazing
and
scolding
and
much
was
not
required
to
irritate
merck
who
also
contrived
to
excite
me
to
impatience
because
now
herder
among
all
authors
and
men
seems
to
respect
swift
the
most
he
was
among
us
called
the
dean
and
this
gave
further
occasion
to
all
sorts
of
perplexities
and
annoyances
nevertheless
we
were
highly
pleased
when
we
learned
that
he
was
to
have
an
appointment
at
bückeburg
which
would
bring
him
double
honour
for
his
new
patron
had
the
highest
fame
as
a
and
brave
though
eccentric
man
thomas
abt
had
been
known
and
celebrated
in
this
service
his
country
still
mourned
his
death
and
was
pleased
with
the
monument
which
his
patron
had
erected
for
him
now
herder
in
the
place
of
the
untimely
deceased
was
to
fulfil
all
those
hopes
which
his
predecessor
had
so
worthily
excited
the
epoch
in
which
this
happened
gave
a
double
brilliancy
and
value
to
such
an
appointment
for
several
german
princes
already
followed
the
example
of
the
count
of
lippe
inasmuch
as
they
took
into
their
service
not
merely
learned
men
and
men
of
business
properly
so
called
but
also
persons
of
mind
and
promise
thus
it
was
said
klopstock
had
been
invited
by
the
margrave
charles
of
baden
not
for
real
business
but
that
by
his
presence
he
might
impart
a
grace
and
be
useful
to
the
higher
society
as
now
the
regard
felt
for
this
excellent
prince
who
paid
attention
to
all
that
was
useful
and
beautiful
increased
in
consequence
so
also
was
the
veneration
for
klopstock
not
a
little
heightened
everything
that
emanated
from
him
was
held
dear
and
valuable
and
we
carefully
wrote
down
his
odes
and
elegies
as
we
could
get
them
we
were
therefore
highly
delighted
when
the
great
caroline
of
made
a
collection
of
them
and
we
obtained
possession
of
one
of
the
few
copies
which
enabled
us
to
complete
our
own
manuscript
collection
hence
those
first
readings
have
long
been
most
in
favour
with
us
nay
we
have
often
refreshed
and
delighted
ourselves
with
poems
which
the
author
afterwards
rejected
so
true
it
is
that
the
life
which
presses
forth
out
of
a
fine
soul
works
with
the
greater
freedom
the
less
it
appears
to
be
drawn
by
criticism
into
the
department
of
art
klopstock
by
his
character
and
conduct
had
managed
to
attain
regard
and
dignity
both
for
himself
and
for
other
men
of
talent
now
they
were
also
if
possible
to
be
indebted
to
him
for
the
security
and
improvement
of
their
domestic
condition
for
the
in
the
previous
period
had
more
to
do
with
important
scientific
books
belonging
to
the
different
faculties
with
for
which
a
moderate
remuneration
was
paid
but
the
production
of
poetical
works
was
looked
upon
as
something
sacred
and
in
this
case
the
acceptance
or
increase
of
any
remuneration
would
have
been
regarded
almost
as
simony
authors
and
publishers
stood
in
the
strangest
reciprocal
position
both
appeared
accordingly
as
it
was
taken
as
patrons
and
clients
the
authors
who
irrespectively
of
their
talent
were
generally
respected
and
levered
by
the
public
as
highly
moral
men
had
a
mental
rank
and
felt
themselves
rewarded
by
the
success
of
their
labours
the
publishers
were
well
satisfied
with
the
second
place
and
enjoyed
a
considerable
profit
but
now
opulence
again
set
the
rich
bookseller
above
the
poor
poet
and
thus
everything
stood
in
the
most
beautiful
equilibrium
magnanimity
and
gratitude
were
not
unfrequent
on
either
side
breitkopf
and
gottsched
lived
all
their
lives
as
inmates
of
the
same
house
stinginess
and
meanness
especially
that
of
piracy
were
not
yet
in
vogue
commotion
in
the
nevertheless
a
general
commotion
had
arisen
among
the
german
authors
they
compared
their
own
very
moderate
if
not
poor
condition
with
the
wealth
of
the
eminent
booksellers
they
considered
how
great
was
the
fame
of
a
gellert
of
a
rabener
and
in
what
narrow
domestic
circumstances
an
universally
esteemed
german
poet
must
struggle
on
if
he
did
not
render
life
easy
by
some
other
calling
even
the
mediocre
and
lesser
minds
felt
a
strong
desire
to
see
their
situation
improved
to
make
themselves
free
of
the
publishers
now
klopstock
came
forward
and
offered
his
republic
of
letters
for
subscription
although
the
latter
cantos
of
the
partly
on
account
of
their
subject
partly
on
account
of
the
treatment
could
not
produce
the
same
effect
as
the
earlier
ones
which
themselves
pure
and
innocent
came
into
a
pure
and
innocent
time
the
same
respect
was
always
maintained
for
the
poet
who
by
the
publication
of
his
odes
had
drawn
to
himself
the
hearts
minds
and
feelings
of
many
persons
many
men
among
whom
were
several
of
great
influence
offered
to
secure
payment
beforehand
this
was
fixed
at
a
the
object
being
it
was
said
not
so
much
to
pay
for
the
book
as
on
this
occasion
to
reward
the
author
for
his
services
to
his
country
now
every
one
pressed
forward
even
youths
and
young
girls
who
had
not
much
to
expend
opened
their
men
and
women
the
higher
and
the
middle
classes
contributed
to
this
holy
offering
and
perhaps
a
thousand
subscribers
all
paying
in
advance
were
collected
expectation
was
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
and
confidence
was
as
great
as
possible
after
this
the
work
on
its
appearance
was
compelled
to
experience
the
strangest
result
in
the
world
it
was
indeed
of
important
value
but
by
no
means
universally
interesting
klopstock
thoughts
on
poetry
and
literature
were
set
forth
in
the
form
of
an
old
german
druidical
republic
his
maxims
on
the
true
and
false
were
expressed
in
pithy
laconic
aphorisms
in
which
however
much
that
was
instructive
was
sacrificed
to
the
singularity
of
form
for
authors
and
the
book
was
and
is
invaluable
but
it
was
only
in
this
circle
that
it
could
be
useful
and
effective
he
who
had
thought
himself
followed
the
thinker
he
who
knew
how
to
seek
and
prize
what
was
genuine
found
himself
instructed
by
the
profound
honest
man
but
the
amateur
the
general
reader
was
not
enlightened
to
him
the
book
remained
sealed
and
yet
it
had
been
placed
in
all
hands
and
while
every
one
expected
a
perfectly
serviceable
work
most
of
them
obtained
one
from
which
they
could
not
get
the
smallest
taste
the
astonishment
was
general
but
the
esteem
for
the
man
was
so
great
that
no
grumbling
scarcely
a
murmur
arose
the
young
and
beautiful
part
of
the
world
got
over
their
loss
and
now
freely
gave
away
the
copies
they
had
so
dearly
purchased
i
received
several
from
kind
female
friends
but
none
of
them
have
remained
with
me
this
undertaking
which
was
successful
to
the
author
but
a
failure
to
the
public
had
the
ill
consequence
that
there
was
now
no
further
thought
about
subscriptions
and
prepayments
nevertheless
the
wish
had
been
too
generally
diffused
for
the
attempt
not
to
be
renewed
the
dessau
now
offered
to
do
this
on
a
large
scale
learned
men
and
publishers
were
here
by
a
close
compact
to
enjoy
both
in
a
certain
proportion
the
advantage
the
necessity
so
long
painfully
felt
again
awakened
a
great
confidence
but
this
could
not
last
long
and
after
a
brief
endeavour
the
parties
separated
with
a
loss
on
both
sides
combination
of
young
poets
however
a
speedy
communication
among
the
friends
of
literature
was
already
introduced
the
united
all
the
young
poets
with
each
other
the
journals
united
the
poet
with
other
authors
my
own
pleasure
in
production
was
boundless
to
what
i
had
produced
i
remained
indifferent
only
when
in
social
circles
i
made
it
present
to
myself
and
others
my
affection
for
it
was
renewed
moreover
many
persons
took
an
interest
in
both
my
larger
and
smaller
works
because
i
urgently
pressed
every
one
who
felt
in
any
degree
inclined
and
adapted
to
production
to
produce
something
independently
after
his
own
fashion
and
was
in
turn
challenged
by
all
to
new
poetising
and
writing
these
mutual
impulses
which
were
carried
even
to
an
extreme
gave
every
one
a
happy
influence
in
his
own
fashion
and
from
this
whirling
and
working
this
living
and
this
taking
and
giving
which
was
carried
on
by
so
many
youths
from
their
own
free
hearts
without
any
theoretical
according
to
the
innate
character
of
each
and
without
any
special
design
arose
that
famed
extolled
and
decried
epoch
in
literature
when
a
mass
of
young
genial
men
with
all
that
audacity
and
assumption
which
is
peculiar
to
their
own
period
of
youth
produced
by
the
application
of
their
powers
much
that
was
good
and
by
the
abuse
of
these
much
and
mischief
and
it
is
indeed
the
action
and
reaction
which
proceeded
from
this
source
that
form
the
chief
theme
of
this
volume
in
what
can
young
people
take
the
highest
interest
how
are
they
to
excite
interest
among
those
of
their
own
age
if
they
are
not
animated
by
love
and
if
affairs
of
the
heart
of
whatever
kind
they
may
be
are
not
living
within
them
i
had
in
secret
to
complain
of
a
love
i
had
lost
this
made
me
mild
and
tolerant
and
more
agreeable
to
society
than
in
those
brilliant
times
when
nothing
reminded
me
of
a
want
or
a
fault
and
i
went
storming
along
completely
without
restraint
frederica
answer
to
a
written
adieu
rent
my
heart
it
was
the
same
hand
the
same
tone
of
thought
the
same
feeling
which
had
formed
itself
for
me
and
by
me
i
now
for
the
first
time
felt
the
loss
which
she
suffered
and
saw
no
means
to
supply
it
or
even
to
alleviate
it
she
was
completely
present
to
me
i
always
felt
that
she
was
wanting
to
me
and
what
was
worst
of
all
i
could
not
forgive
myself
for
my
own
misfortune
gretchen
had
been
taken
away
from
me
annette
had
left
me
now
for
the
first
time
i
was
guilty
i
had
wounded
the
most
beautiful
heart
to
its
very
depths
and
the
period
of
a
gloomy
repentance
with
the
absence
of
a
refreshing
love
to
which
i
had
grown
accustomed
was
most
agonising
nay
insupportable
but
man
will
live
and
hence
i
took
an
honest
interest
in
others
i
sought
to
disentangle
their
embarrassments
and
to
unite
what
was
about
to
part
that
they
might
not
have
the
same
lot
as
myself
they
were
hence
accustomed
to
call
me
the
confidant
and
on
account
of
wandering
about
the
district
the
wanderer
in
producing
that
calm
for
my
mind
which
i
felt
under
the
open
sky
in
the
valleys
on
the
heights
in
the
fields
and
in
the
woods
the
situation
of
frankfort
was
serviceable
as
it
lay
in
the
middle
between
darmstadt
and
hamburg
two
pleasant
places
which
are
on
good
terms
with
each
other
through
the
relationship
of
both
courts
i
accustomed
myself
to
live
on
the
road
and
like
a
messenger
to
wander
about
between
the
mountains
and
the
flat
country
often
i
went
alone
or
in
company
through
my
native
city
as
if
it
did
not
at
all
concern
me
dined
at
one
of
the
great
inns
in
the
and
after
dinner
went
further
on
my
way
more
than
ever
was
i
directed
to
the
open
world
and
to
free
nature
on
my
way
i
sang
to
myself
strange
hymns
and
dithyrambics
of
which
one
entitled
the
wanderer
still
remains
this
i
sang
aloud
in
an
impassioned
manner
when
i
found
myself
in
a
terrific
storm
which
i
was
obliged
to
meet
my
heart
was
untouched
and
unoccupied
i
conscientiously
avoided
all
closer
connexion
with
ladies
and
thus
it
remained
concealed
from
me
that
inattentive
and
unconscious
as
i
was
an
amiable
spirit
was
secretly
hovering
round
me
it
was
not
until
many
years
afterwards
nay
until
after
her
death
that
i
learned
of
her
secret
heavenly
love
in
a
manner
that
necessarily
overwhelmed
me
but
i
was
innocent
and
could
purely
and
honestly
pity
an
innocent
being
nay
i
could
do
this
the
more
as
the
discovery
occurred
at
an
epoch
when
completely
without
passion
i
had
the
happiness
of
living
for
myself
and
my
own
intellectual
inclinations
at
the
time
when
i
was
pained
by
my
grief
at
frederica
situation
i
again
after
my
old
fashion
sought
aid
from
poetry
i
again
continued
the
poetical
confession
which
i
had
commenced
that
by
this
penance
i
might
be
worthy
of
an
internal
absolution
the
two
marias
in
von
and
and
the
two
bad
characters
who
play
the
part
of
their
lovers
may
have
been
the
results
of
such
penitent
reflections
skating
but
as
in
youth
one
soon
overcomes
mental
wounds
and
diseases
because
a
healthy
system
of
organic
life
can
rise
up
for
a
sick
one
and
allow
it
time
to
grow
healthy
again
corporeal
exercises
on
many
a
favourable
opportunity
came
forward
with
very
advantageous
effect
and
i
was
excited
in
many
ways
to
man
myself
afresh
and
to
seek
new
pleasures
of
life
and
enjoyments
riding
gradually
took
the
place
of
those
sauntering
melancholy
toilsome
and
at
the
same
time
tedious
and
aimless
rambles
on
foot
one
reached
one
end
more
quickly
merrily
and
commodiously
the
young
people
again
introduced
fencing
but
in
particular
on
the
of
winter
a
new
world
was
revealed
to
us
since
i
at
once
determined
to
skate
an
exercise
which
i
had
never
attempted
and
in
a
short
time
by
practice
reflection
and
perseverance
brought
it
as
far
as
was
necessary
to
enjoy
with
others
a
gay
animated
course
on
the
ice
without
wishing
to
distinguish
myself
for
this
new
joyous
activity
we
were
also
indebted
to
klopstock
to
his
enthusiasm
for
this
happy
species
of
motion
which
private
accounts
confirmed
while
his
odes
gave
an
undeniable
evidence
of
it
i
still
exactly
remember
that
on
a
cheerful
frosty
morning
i
sprang
out
of
bed
and
uttered
aloud
these
passages
already
glad
with
feeling
of
health
far
down
along
the
shore
i
have
the
covering
crystal
does
the
winter
advancing
day
softly
illumine
the
lake
the
night
has
cast
the
glittering
frost
like
stars
upon
it
my
hesitating
and
wavering
resolution
was
fixed
at
once
and
i
flew
straight
to
the
place
where
so
old
a
beginner
might
with
some
degree
of
propriety
make
his
first
trial
and
indeed
this
manifestation
of
our
strength
well
deserved
to
be
commended
by
klopstock
for
it
is
an
exercise
which
brings
us
into
contact
with
the
freshest
childhood
summons
the
youth
to
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
suppleness
and
is
fitted
to
keep
off
a
stagnant
old
age
we
were
immoderately
addicted
to
this
pleasure
to
pass
thus
a
splendid
sunday
on
the
ice
did
not
satisfy
us
we
continued
our
movement
late
into
the
night
for
as
other
exertions
fatigue
the
body
so
does
this
give
it
a
constantly
new
power
the
full
moon
rising
from
the
clouds
over
the
wide
nocturnal
meadows
which
were
frozen
into
fields
of
ice
the
which
rustled
towards
us
on
our
course
the
solemn
thunder
of
the
ice
which
sank
as
the
water
decreased
the
strange
echo
of
our
own
movements
rendered
the
scenes
of
ossian
just
present
to
our
minds
now
this
friend
now
that
uttered
an
ode
of
klopstock
in
a
declamatory
recitative
and
if
we
found
ourselves
together
at
dawn
the
unfeigned
praise
of
the
author
of
our
joys
broke
forth
and
should
he
not
be
immortal
who
found
for
us
health
and
joys
which
the
horse
though
bold
in
his
course
never
gave
and
which
even
the
ball
is
without
such
gratitude
is
earned
by
a
man
who
knows
how
to
honour
and
worthily
to
extend
an
earthly
act
by
spiritual
incitement
and
thus
as
children
of
talent
whose
mental
gifts
have
at
an
early
period
been
cultivated
to
an
extraordinary
degree
return
if
they
can
to
the
simplest
sports
of
youth
did
we
too
often
forget
our
calling
to
more
serious
things
nevertheless
this
very
motion
so
often
carried
on
in
solitude
this
agreeable
soaring
in
undetermined
space
again
excited
many
of
my
internal
wants
which
had
for
a
time
lain
dormant
and
i
have
been
indebted
to
such
hours
for
a
more
speedy
elaboration
of
older
plans
the
darker
ages
of
german
history
had
always
occupied
my
desire
for
knowledge
and
my
imagination
the
thought
of
dramatizing
von
with
all
the
circumstances
of
his
time
was
one
which
i
much
liked
and
valued
i
industriously
read
the
chief
authors
to
datt
work
pace
i
devoted
all
my
attention
i
had
sedulously
studied
it
through
and
rendered
those
singular
details
as
visible
to
me
as
possible
these
endeavours
which
were
directed
to
moral
and
poetical
ends
i
could
also
use
in
another
direction
and
i
was
now
to
visit
wetzlar
i
had
sufficient
historical
preparation
for
the
imperial
chamber
had
arisen
in
consequence
of
the
public
tranquillity
and
its
history
could
serve
as
an
important
clue
through
the
confused
events
of
germany
indeed
the
constitution
of
the
courts
and
armies
gives
the
most
accurate
insight
into
the
constitution
of
every
empire
even
the
finances
the
influence
of
which
are
considered
so
important
come
much
less
under
consideration
for
if
the
whole
is
deficient
it
is
only
necessary
to
take
from
the
individual
what
he
has
laboriously
scraped
together
and
thus
the
state
is
always
sufficiently
rich
what
occurred
to
me
at
wetzlar
is
of
no
great
importance
but
it
may
inspire
a
greater
interest
if
the
reader
will
not
disdain
a
cursory
history
of
the
imperial
chamber
in
order
to
render
present
to
his
mind
the
unfavourable
moment
at
which
i
arrived
there
history
of
the
imperial
chamber
the
lords
of
the
earth
are
such
principally
because
they
can
assemble
around
them
in
war
the
bravest
and
most
resolute
and
in
peace
the
wisest
and
most
just
even
to
the
state
of
a
german
emperor
belonged
a
court
of
this
kind
which
always
accompanied
him
in
his
expeditions
through
the
empire
but
neither
this
precaution
nor
the
suabian
law
which
prevailed
in
the
south
of
germany
nor
the
saxon
law
which
prevailed
in
the
north
neither
the
judges
appointed
to
maintain
them
nor
the
decisions
of
the
peers
of
the
contending
parties
neither
the
umpires
recognised
by
agreement
nor
friendly
compacts
instituted
by
the
clergy
nothing
in
short
could
quiet
that
excited
chivalric
spirit
of
feuds
which
had
been
roused
fostered
and
made
a
custom
among
the
germans
by
internal
discord
by
foreign
campaigns
by
the
crusades
especially
and
even
by
judicial
usages
to
the
emperor
as
well
as
to
the
powerful
estates
these
squabbles
were
extremely
annoying
while
through
them
the
less
powerful
became
troublesome
to
each
other
and
if
they
combined
to
the
great
also
all
outward
strength
was
paralysed
while
internal
order
was
destroyed
and
besides
this
a
great
part
of
the
country
was
still
encumbered
with
the
of
the
horrors
of
which
a
notion
may
be
formed
if
we
think
that
it
degenerated
into
a
secret
police
which
at
last
even
fell
into
the
hands
of
private
persons
many
attempts
to
steer
against
these
evils
had
been
made
in
vain
until
at
last
the
estates
urgently
proposed
a
court
formed
from
among
themselves
this
proposal
as
it
might
have
been
nevertheless
indicated
an
extension
of
the
privileges
of
the
estates
and
a
limitation
of
the
imperial
power
under
frederic
iii
the
matter
is
delayed
his
son
maximilian
being
pressed
from
without
complies
he
appoints
the
chief
judge
the
estates
send
the
assistants
there
were
to
be
of
them
but
at
first
twelve
are
thought
sufficient
an
universal
fault
of
which
men
are
guilty
in
their
was
the
first
and
perpetual
fundamental
defect
of
the
imperial
chamber
insufficient
means
were
applied
to
a
great
end
the
number
of
the
assessors
was
too
small
how
was
the
difficult
and
extensive
problem
to
be
solved
by
them
but
who
could
urge
an
efficient
arrangement
the
emperor
could
not
favour
an
institution
which
seemed
to
work
more
against
him
than
for
him
far
more
reason
had
he
to
complete
the
formation
of
his
own
court
his
own
council
if
on
the
other
hand
we
regard
the
interest
of
the
estates
all
that
they
could
properly
have
to
do
with
was
the
stoppage
of
bloodshed
whether
the
wound
was
healed
did
not
so
much
concern
them
and
now
there
was
to
be
besides
a
new
expense
it
may
not
have
been
quite
plainly
seen
that
by
this
institution
every
prince
increased
his
retinue
for
a
decided
end
indeed
but
who
readily
gives
money
for
what
is
necessary
every
one
would
be
satisfied
if
he
could
have
what
is
useful
for
god
sake
at
first
the
assistants
were
to
live
on
fees
then
followed
a
moderate
grant
from
the
estates
both
were
scanty
but
to
meet
the
great
and
striking
exigency
willing
clever
and
industrious
men
were
found
and
the
court
was
established
whether
it
was
perceived
that
the
question
here
was
concerning
only
the
alleviation
and
not
the
cure
of
the
evil
or
whether
as
in
similar
cases
the
flattering
hope
was
entertained
that
much
was
to
be
done
with
little
is
not
to
be
decided
it
is
enough
that
the
court
served
rather
as
a
pretext
to
punish
the
originators
of
mischief
than
completely
to
prevent
wrong
but
it
has
scarcely
met
than
a
power
grows
out
of
itself
it
feels
the
eminence
on
which
it
is
placed
it
recognises
its
own
great
political
importance
it
now
endeavours
by
a
striking
activity
to
acquire
for
itself
a
more
decided
respect
they
briskly
got
through
what
can
and
must
be
rapidly
dispatched
what
can
be
decided
at
the
moment
or
what
can
otherwise
be
easily
judged
and
thus
throughout
the
empire
they
appear
effective
and
dignified
on
the
other
hand
matters
of
weightier
import
the
properly
so
called
remained
behindhand
and
this
was
no
misfortune
the
only
concern
of
the
state
is
that
possession
shall
be
certain
and
secure
whether
it
is
also
legal
is
of
less
consequence
hence
from
the
monstrous
and
number
of
delayed
suits
no
mischief
arose
to
the
empire
against
people
who
employed
force
provision
was
already
made
and
with
such
matters
could
be
settled
but
those
on
the
other
hand
who
legally
disputed
about
possession
lived
enjoyed
or
starved
as
they
could
they
died
were
ruined
or
made
it
up
but
all
this
was
the
good
or
evil
of
individual
families
the
empire
was
gradually
tranquillised
for
the
imperial
chamber
was
endowed
with
a
legal
against
the
disobedient
had
it
been
able
to
hurl
the
bolt
of
excommunication
this
would
have
been
more
effective
but
now
what
with
the
sometimes
increased
sometimes
diminished
number
of
assessors
what
with
the
many
interruptions
what
with
the
removal
of
the
court
from
one
place
to
another
these
arrears
these
records
necessarily
increased
to
an
infinite
extent
now
in
the
distress
of
war
a
part
of
the
archives
was
sent
for
safety
from
spire
to
aschaffenburg
a
part
to
worms
the
third
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
french
who
thought
they
had
gained
the
but
would
afterwards
have
been
glad
to
get
rid
of
such
a
chaos
of
paper
if
any
one
would
but
have
furnished
the
carriages
during
the
negotiations
for
the
peace
of
westphalia
the
chosen
men
who
were
assembled
plainly
saw
what
sort
of
a
lever
was
required
to
move
from
its
place
a
load
like
that
of
sisyphus
fifty
assessors
were
now
to
be
appointed
but
the
number
was
never
made
up
the
half
of
it
was
again
made
to
suffice
because
the
expense
appeared
too
great
but
if
the
parties
interested
had
all
seen
their
advantage
in
the
matter
the
whole
might
well
have
been
afforded
to
pay
assessors
about
one
hundred
thousand
florins
were
required
and
how
easily
could
double
that
amount
have
been
raised
in
germany
the
proposition
to
endow
the
imperial
chamber
with
confiscated
church
property
could
not
pass
for
how
could
the
two
religious
parties
agree
to
such
a
sacrifice
the
catholics
were
not
willing
to
lose
any
more
and
the
protestants
wished
to
employ
what
they
had
gained
each
for
his
own
private
ends
the
division
of
the
empire
into
two
religious
parties
had
here
in
several
respects
the
worst
influence
the
interest
which
the
estates
took
in
this
their
court
diminished
more
and
more
the
more
powerful
wished
to
free
themselves
from
the
confederation
licenses
exempting
their
possessor
from
being
prosecuted
before
any
higher
tribunal
were
sought
with
more
and
more
eagerness
the
greater
kept
back
with
their
payments
while
the
lesser
who
moreover
believed
themselves
wronged
in
the
estimates
delayed
as
long
as
they
could
how
difficult
was
it
therefore
to
raise
the
supplies
necessary
for
payment
hence
arose
a
new
occupation
a
new
loss
of
time
for
the
chamber
previously
the
annual
visitations
had
taken
care
of
this
matter
princes
in
person
or
their
councillors
went
only
for
months
or
weeks
to
the
place
of
the
court
examined
the
state
of
the
treasury
investigated
the
arrears
and
undertook
to
get
them
in
at
the
same
time
if
anything
was
about
to
create
an
impediment
in
the
course
of
law
or
the
court
or
any
abuse
to
creep
in
they
were
authorised
to
provide
a
remedy
the
faults
of
the
institution
they
were
to
discover
and
remove
but
it
was
not
till
afterwards
that
the
investigation
and
punishment
of
the
personal
crimes
of
its
members
became
a
part
of
their
duty
but
because
parties
engaged
in
litigation
always
like
to
extend
their
hopes
a
moment
longer
and
on
this
account
always
seek
and
appeal
to
higher
authorities
so
did
these
visitators
become
a
court
of
revision
from
which
at
first
in
determined
manifest
cases
persons
hoped
to
find
restitution
but
at
last
in
all
cases
delay
and
perpetuation
of
the
controversy
to
which
the
appeal
to
the
imperial
diet
and
the
endeavour
of
the
two
religious
parties
if
not
to
outweigh
each
other
at
any
rate
to
preserve
an
equilibrium
contributed
their
part
but
if
one
considers
what
this
court
might
have
been
without
such
obstacles
without
such
disturbing
and
destructive
conditions
one
can
not
imagine
it
remarkable
and
important
enough
had
it
been
supplied
at
the
beginning
with
a
sufficient
number
of
persons
had
a
sufficient
support
been
secured
to
them
the
monstrous
influence
which
this
body
might
have
attained
considering
the
aptness
of
the
germans
would
have
been
immeasurable
the
honourable
title
of
amphictyons
which
was
only
bestowed
on
them
oratorically
they
would
actually
have
deserved
nay
they
might
have
elevated
themselves
into
an
intermediate
power
while
revered
by
the
head
and
the
members
but
far
removed
from
such
great
effects
the
court
excepting
for
a
short
time
under
charles
and
before
the
thirty
years
war
dragged
itself
miserably
along
one
often
can
not
understand
how
men
could
be
found
for
such
a
thankless
and
melancholy
employment
but
what
a
man
does
every
day
he
puts
up
with
if
he
has
any
talent
for
it
even
if
he
does
not
exactly
see
that
anything
will
come
of
it
the
german
especially
is
of
this
persevering
turn
of
mind
and
thus
for
three
hundred
years
the
worthiest
men
have
employed
themselves
on
these
labours
and
objects
a
characteristic
gallery
of
such
figures
would
even
now
excite
interest
and
inspire
courage
for
it
is
just
in
such
anarchical
times
that
the
able
man
takes
the
strongest
position
and
he
who
desires
what
is
good
finds
himself
right
in
his
place
thus
for
instance
the
of
fürstenberg
was
still
held
in
blessed
memory
and
with
the
death
of
this
excellent
man
begins
the
epoch
of
many
pernicious
abuses
but
all
these
defects
whether
later
or
earlier
arose
from
one
only
original
source
the
small
number
of
persons
it
was
decreed
that
the
assistants
were
to
act
in
a
fixed
order
and
according
to
a
determined
arrangement
every
one
could
know
when
the
turn
would
come
to
him
and
which
of
the
cases
belonging
to
him
it
would
affect
he
could
work
up
to
this
point
he
could
prepare
himself
but
now
the
innumerable
arrears
had
heaped
themselves
up
and
they
were
forced
to
resolve
to
select
the
more
important
cases
and
to
deal
with
them
out
of
order
but
with
a
pressure
of
important
affairs
the
decision
as
to
which
matter
has
the
more
weight
is
difficult
and
selection
leaves
room
for
favour
now
another
critical
case
occurred
the
tormented
both
himself
and
the
court
with
a
difficult
involved
affair
and
at
last
no
one
was
found
willing
to
take
up
the
judgment
the
parties
had
come
to
an
agreement
had
separated
had
died
had
changed
their
minds
hence
they
resolved
to
take
in
hand
only
the
cases
of
which
they
were
reminded
they
wished
to
be
convinced
of
the
continued
obstinacy
of
the
parties
and
hence
was
given
an
introduction
to
the
greatest
defects
for
he
who
commends
his
affairs
must
commend
them
to
somebody
and
to
whom
can
one
commend
them
better
than
to
him
who
has
them
already
in
his
hands
to
keep
this
one
regularly
secret
was
impossible
for
how
could
he
remain
concealed
with
so
many
subordinates
all
acquainted
with
the
matter
if
acceleration
is
requested
favour
may
well
be
requested
likewise
for
the
very
fact
that
people
urge
their
cause
shows
that
they
consider
it
just
this
will
perhaps
not
be
done
in
a
direct
manner
certainly
it
will
be
first
done
through
subordinates
these
must
be
gained
over
and
thus
an
introduction
is
given
to
all
sorts
of
intrigues
and
briberies
the
emperor
joseph
following
his
own
impulse
and
in
imitation
of
frederic
first
directed
his
attention
to
arms
and
the
administration
of
justice
he
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
imperial
chamber
traditional
wrongs
introduced
abuses
had
not
remained
unknown
to
him
even
here
something
was
to
be
stirred
up
shaken
and
done
without
inquiring
whether
it
was
his
imperial
right
without
foreseeing
the
possibility
of
a
happy
result
he
proposed
a
revival
of
the
visitation
and
hastened
its
opening
for
one
hundred
and
sixty
years
no
regular
visitation
had
taken
place
a
monstrous
chaos
of
papers
lay
swelled
up
and
increased
every
year
since
the
seventeen
assessors
were
not
even
able
to
despatch
the
current
business
twenty
thousand
processes
were
heaped
up
sixty
could
be
settled
every
year
and
double
that
number
was
brought
forward
besides
it
was
not
a
small
number
of
revisions
that
awaited
the
visitators
they
were
estimated
at
fifty
thousand
many
other
abuses
in
addition
to
this
hindered
the
course
of
justice
but
the
most
critical
matter
of
all
was
the
personal
delinquency
of
some
assessors
which
appeared
in
the
background
the
visitation
at
wetzlar
when
i
was
about
to
go
to
wetzlar
the
visitation
had
been
already
for
some
years
in
operation
the
parties
accused
had
been
suspended
from
office
the
investigation
had
been
carried
a
long
way
and
because
the
masters
and
commissioners
of
german
political
law
could
not
let
pass
this
opportunity
of
exhibiting
their
sagacity
and
devoting
it
to
the
common
weal
several
profound
works
appeared
from
which
every
one
who
possessed
only
some
preparatory
knowledge
could
derive
solid
instruction
when
on
this
occasion
they
went
back
into
the
constitution
of
the
empire
and
the
books
written
upon
it
it
was
striking
to
me
how
the
monstrous
condition
of
this
thoroughly
diseased
body
which
was
kept
alive
by
a
miracle
alone
was
the
very
thing
that
most
suited
the
learned
for
the
venerable
german
industry
which
was
more
directed
to
the
collection
and
development
of
details
than
to
results
found
here
an
inexhaustible
impulse
to
new
employment
and
whether
the
empire
was
opposed
to
the
emperor
the
lesser
to
the
greater
estates
or
the
catholics
to
the
protestants
there
was
necessarily
always
according
to
the
diversity
of
interest
a
diversity
of
opinion
and
always
an
occasion
for
new
contests
and
controversies
since
i
had
rendered
all
these
older
and
newer
circumstances
as
present
to
my
mind
as
possible
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
promise
myself
much
pleasure
from
my
abode
at
wetzlar
the
prospect
of
finding
in
a
city
which
was
indeed
well
situated
but
small
and
a
double
world
first
the
domestic
old
traditional
world
then
a
foreign
new
one
authorized
to
scrutinize
the
other
with
severity
a
judging
and
a
judged
tribunal
many
an
inhabitant
in
fear
and
anxiety
lest
he
might
also
be
drawn
into
the
impending
investigation
persons
of
consideration
long
held
in
respect
convicted
of
the
most
scandalous
misdeeds
and
marked
out
for
disgraceful
punishment
all
this
together
made
the
most
dismal
picture
and
could
not
lure
me
to
go
deeper
into
a
business
which
involved
in
itself
seemed
so
much
perplexed
by
wrong
that
excepting
the
german
civil
and
public
law
i
should
find
nothing
remarkable
in
the
scientific
way
that
i
should
be
without
all
poetical
communication
i
thought
i
could
foresee
when
after
some
delay
the
desire
of
altering
my
situation
more
than
impulse
to
knowledge
led
me
to
this
spot
but
how
surprised
i
was
when
instead
of
a
crabbed
society
a
third
academical
life
sprang
towards
me
at
a
large
i
found
a
number
of
young
lively
people
nearly
all
subordinates
to
the
commission
they
gave
me
a
friendly
reception
and
the
very
first
day
it
remained
no
secret
to
me
that
they
had
cheered
their
by
a
romantic
fiction
with
much
wit
and
cheerfulness
they
represented
a
table
of
knights
at
the
top
sat
the
by
his
side
the
chancellor
then
the
most
important
officers
of
the
state
now
followed
the
knights
according
to
their
seniority
strangers
on
the
other
hand
who
visited
were
forced
to
be
content
with
the
lowest
places
and
to
these
the
conversation
was
almost
unintelligible
because
the
language
of
the
society
in
addition
to
the
chivalric
expressions
was
enriched
with
many
allusions
to
every
one
a
name
with
an
epithet
was
assigned
me
they
called
götz
von
berlichingen
the
honest
the
former
i
earned
by
the
attention
to
the
gallant
german
patriarch
the
latter
by
my
upright
affection
and
devotion
for
the
eminent
men
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
to
the
count
von
kielmannsegg
i
was
much
indebted
during
this
residence
he
was
the
most
serious
of
all
highly
clever
and
to
be
relied
on
there
was
von
goué
a
man
hard
to
be
deciphered
and
described
a
blunt
kind
quietly
reserved
hanoverian
figure
he
was
not
wanting
in
talent
of
various
kinds
it
was
conjectured
concerning
him
that
he
was
a
natural
son
he
loved
besides
a
certain
mysterious
deportment
and
concealed
his
most
peculiar
wishes
and
plans
under
various
eccentricities
as
indeed
he
was
properly
speaking
the
very
soul
of
the
odd
confederation
of
knights
without
having
striven
to
attain
the
post
of
on
the
contrary
when
just
at
this
time
the
head
of
the
knighthood
departed
he
caused
another
to
be
elected
and
through
him
exercised
his
influence
thus
he
managed
so
to
direct
several
little
trifles
that
they
appeared
of
importance
and
could
be
carried
out
in
mythical
forms
but
with
all
this
no
serious
purpose
could
be
remarked
in
him
he
was
only
concerned
to
get
rid
of
the
tedium
which
he
and
his
colleagues
during
their
protracted
occupation
necessarily
felt
and
to
fill
up
the
empty
space
if
only
with
cobwebs
for
the
rest
this
mythical
caricature
was
carried
on
with
great
external
seriousness
and
no
one
found
it
ridiculous
if
a
certain
mill
was
treated
as
a
castle
and
the
miller
as
lord
of
the
fortress
if
the
four
sons
of
haimon
was
declared
a
canonical
book
and
on
the
occasion
of
ceremonies
extracts
from
it
were
read
with
veneration
the
dubbing
of
knights
took
place
with
traditional
symbols
borrowed
from
several
orders
of
knighthood
a
chief
motive
for
jest
was
the
fact
that
what
was
manifest
was
treated
as
a
secret
the
affair
was
carried
on
publicly
and
yet
nothing
was
to
be
said
about
it
the
list
of
the
whole
body
of
knights
was
printed
with
as
much
importance
as
a
calendar
of
the
imperial
diet
and
if
families
ventured
to
scoff
at
this
and
to
declare
the
whole
matter
absurd
and
ridiculous
they
were
punished
by
an
intrigue
being
carried
on
until
a
solemn
husband
or
near
relation
was
induced
to
join
the
company
and
to
be
dubbed
a
knight
for
then
there
was
a
splendid
burst
of
malicious
joy
at
the
annoyance
of
the
connexions
whimsical
societies
at
wetzlar
into
this
chivalric
state
of
existence
another
strange
order
had
insinuated
itself
which
was
to
be
philosophical
and
mystical
and
had
no
name
of
its
own
the
first
degree
was
called
the
transition
the
second
the
transition
transition
the
third
the
transition
to
the
transition
and
the
fourth
the
transition
to
the
transition
transition
to
interpret
the
high
sense
of
this
series
of
degrees
was
now
the
duty
of
the
initiated
and
this
was
done
according
to
the
standard
of
a
little
printed
book
in
which
these
strange
words
were
explained
or
rather
amplified
in
a
manner
still
more
strange
occupation
with
these
things
was
the
most
desirable
pastime
the
folly
of
behrisch
and
the
perversity
of
lenz
seemed
here
to
have
united
themselves
i
only
repeat
that
not
a
trace
of
purpose
was
to
be
found
behind
these
veils
although
i
very
readily
took
part
in
such
fooleries
had
first
brought
into
order
the
extracts
from
the
four
sons
of
haimon
made
proposals
how
they
should
be
read
on
feasts
and
solemn
occasions
and
even
understood
how
to
deliver
them
myself
with
great
emphasis
i
had
nevertheless
grown
weary
of
such
things
before
and
therefore
as
i
missed
my
frankfort
and
darmstadt
circles
i
was
highly
pleased
to
have
found
gotter
who
attached
himself
to
me
with
honest
affection
and
to
whom
i
showed
in
return
a
hearty
his
turn
of
mind
was
delicate
clear
and
cheerful
his
talents
were
practised
and
well
regulated
he
aimed
at
french
elegance
and
was
pleased
with
that
part
of
english
literature
which
is
occupied
with
moral
and
agreeable
subjects
we
passed
together
many
pleasant
hours
in
which
we
communicated
to
each
other
our
knowledge
plans
and
inclinations
he
excited
me
to
many
little
works
especially
as
being
in
connexion
with
the
people
of
göttingen
he
desired
some
of
my
poems
for
i
thus
came
into
contact
with
those
who
young
and
hill
of
talent
held
themselves
together
and
afterwards
effected
so
much
and
in
such
various
ways
the
two
counts
stolberg
bürger
voss
hölty
and
others
were
assembled
in
faith
and
spirit
around
klopstock
whose
influence
extended
in
every
direction
in
such
a
poetical
circle
which
more
and
more
extended
itself
was
developed
at
the
same
time
with
such
manifold
poetical
merits
another
turn
of
mind
to
which
i
can
give
no
exactly
proper
name
it
might
be
called
the
need
of
independence
which
always
arises
in
time
of
peace
and
exactly
when
properly
speaking
one
is
not
dependent
in
war
we
bear
the
rude
force
as
well
as
we
can
we
feel
ourselves
physically
and
economically
but
not
morally
wounded
the
constraint
shames
no
one
and
it
is
no
disgraceful
service
to
serve
the
time
we
accustom
ourselves
to
suffer
from
foes
and
friends
we
have
wishes
but
no
particular
views
in
peace
on
the
contrary
love
of
freedom
becomes
more
and
more
prominent
and
the
more
free
one
is
the
more
free
one
wishes
to
be
we
will
not
tolerate
anything
over
us
we
will
not
be
restrained
no
one
shall
be
restrained
and
this
tender
nay
morbid
feeling
appears
in
noble
souls
under
the
form
of
justice
this
spirit
and
feeling
then
showed
itself
everywhere
and
just
because
few
were
oppressed
it
was
wished
to
free
even
these
from
temporary
oppression
and
thus
arose
a
certain
moral
feud
a
mixture
of
individuals
with
the
government
which
with
laudable
beginnings
led
to
inevitably
unfortunate
results
difficulty
of
german
patriotism
voltaire
by
the
protection
which
he
had
bestowed
on
the
family
of
calas
had
excited
great
attention
and
made
himself
respected
in
germany
the
attempt
of
lavater
against
the
sheriff
of
the
province
had
been
almost
more
striking
and
important
the
æsthetical
feeling
united
with
youthful
courage
strove
forward
and
as
shortly
before
persons
had
studied
to
obtain
offices
they
now
began
to
act
as
overlookers
of
those
in
office
and
the
time
was
near
when
the
dramatist
and
novelist
loved
best
to
seek
their
villains
among
ministers
and
official
persons
hence
arose
a
world
half
real
half
imaginary
of
action
and
reaction
in
which
we
afterwards
lived
to
see
the
most
violent
imputations
and
instigations
which
the
writers
of
periodical
publications
and
journals
with
a
sort
of
passion
allowed
themselves
under
the
garb
of
justice
and
went
to
work
the
more
irresistibly
as
they
made
the
public
believe
that
it
was
itself
the
true
tribunal
a
foolish
notion
as
no
public
has
an
executive
power
and
in
dismembered
germany
public
opinion
neither
benefited
nor
injured
any
one
among
us
young
people
there
was
indeed
nothing
to
be
traced
which
could
have
been
culpable
but
a
certain
similar
notion
composed
of
poetry
morality
and
a
noble
striving
and
which
was
harmless
but
yet
fruitless
had
taken
possession
of
us
by
his
and
the
dedication
of
it
to
joseph
the
second
klopstock
had
produced
a
wonderful
excitement
the
germans
who
freed
themselves
from
roman
oppression
were
nobly
and
powerfully
represented
and
this
picture
was
well
suited
to
awaken
the
of
a
nation
but
because
in
peace
patriotism
really
consists
only
in
this
that
every
one
sweeps
his
own
door
minds
his
own
business
and
learns
his
own
lesson
that
it
may
go
well
with
his
house
so
did
the
feeling
for
fatherland
excited
by
klopstock
find
no
object
on
which
it
could
exercise
itself
frederic
had
saved
the
honour
of
one
part
of
the
germans
against
an
united
world
and
every
member
of
the
nation
by
applause
and
reverence
of
this
great
prince
was
allowed
to
share
in
his
victory
but
what
was
to
come
of
this
excited
warlike
spirit
of
defiance
what
direction
should
it
take
and
what
effect
produce
at
first
it
was
merely
a
poetical
form
and
the
songs
ridiculous
were
accumulated
through
this
impulse
this
incitement
there
were
no
external
enemies
to
fight
so
people
made
tyrants
for
themselves
and
for
this
purpose
princes
and
their
servants
were
obliged
to
bestow
their
figures
first
only
in
general
outline
but
gradually
with
particulars
here
it
was
that
poetry
attached
itself
with
vehemence
to
that
interference
with
the
administration
of
justice
which
is
blamed
above
and
it
is
remarkable
to
see
poems
of
that
time
written
in
a
spirit
by
which
everything
of
a
higher
order
whether
monarchical
or
aristocratic
is
abolished
for
my
own
part
i
continued
to
make
poetry
the
expression
of
my
own
whims
and
feelings
little
poems
like
the
wanderer
belong
to
this
time
they
were
inserted
in
the
but
from
whatever
of
the
mania
had
worked
itself
into
me
i
shortly
endeavoured
to
free
myself
in
von
since
i
described
how
in
disordered
times
this
brave
man
resolves
to
take
the
place
of
the
law
and
the
executive
power
but
is
in
despair
when
to
the
supreme
authority
which
he
recognises
and
reveres
he
appears
in
an
equivocal
light
and
even
rebellious
by
klopstock
odes
it
was
not
so
much
the
northern
mythology
as
the
nomenclature
of
the
divinities
that
had
been
introduced
into
german
poetry
and
although
i
gladly
made
use
of
everything
else
that
was
offered
me
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
use
this
for
the
following
causes
i
had
long
become
acquainted
with
the
fables
of
the
edda
from
the
preface
to
mallet
and
had
at
once
made
myself
master
of
them
they
belonged
to
those
tales
which
when
asked
by
a
company
i
most
willingly
related
herder
put
resenius
into
my
hands
and
made
me
better
acquainted
with
the
heroic
but
all
these
things
worthy
as
i
held
them
i
could
not
bring
within
the
circle
of
my
own
poetic
faculty
nobly
as
they
excited
my
imagination
they
nevertheless
entirely
withdrew
themselves
from
the
sensuous
perception
while
the
mythology
of
the
greeks
changed
by
the
greatest
artists
in
the
world
into
visible
easily
imagined
forms
still
existed
before
our
own
eyes
in
abundance
gods
in
general
i
did
not
allow
often
to
appear
because
at
all
events
they
had
their
abode
out
of
the
nature
which
i
understood
how
to
imitate
what
now
could
have
induced
to
substitute
woden
for
jupiter
and
thor
for
mars
and
instead
of
the
southern
accurately
described
figures
to
introduce
forms
of
mist
nay
mere
verbal
sounds
into
my
poems
on
the
one
side
they
were
related
to
the
equally
formless
heroes
of
ossian
only
they
were
ruder
and
more
gigantic
on
the
other
i
brought
them
into
contact
with
the
cheerful
tale
for
the
humoristic
vein
which
runs
through
the
whole
northern
mythus
was
to
me
highly
pleasing
and
remarkable
it
appeared
to
me
the
only
one
which
jests
with
itself
throughout
wondrous
giants
magicians
and
monsters
opposed
to
an
odd
dynasty
of
gods
and
only
occupied
in
leading
astray
and
deriding
the
highest
persons
during
their
government
while
they
threaten
them
besides
with
disgraceful
and
inevitable
destruction
i
felt
a
similar
if
not
an
equal
interest
for
the
indian
fables
which
i
at
first
learned
to
know
from
dapper
and
likewise
added
with
great
pleasure
to
my
store
of
tales
in
subsequent
repetitions
i
succeeded
especially
with
the
altar
of
ram
and
notwithstanding
the
great
number
of
persons
in
this
tale
the
ape
hannemann
remained
the
favorite
of
my
public
but
even
these
unformed
and
monsters
could
not
satisfy
me
in
a
true
poetic
sense
they
lay
too
far
from
the
truth
towards
which
my
mind
unceasingly
strove
taste
for
homer
but
against
all
these
goblins
so
repulsive
to
art
my
sense
for
the
beautiful
was
to
be
protected
by
the
noblest
power
always
fortunate
is
that
epoch
in
a
literature
when
the
great
works
of
the
past
again
rise
up
as
if
thawed
and
come
into
notice
because
they
then
produce
a
perfectly
fresh
effect
even
the
homeric
light
rose
again
quite
new
to
us
and
indeed
quite
in
the
spirit
of
the
time
which
highly
favoured
such
an
appearance
for
the
constant
reference
to
nature
had
at
last
the
effect
that
we
learned
to
regard
even
the
works
of
the
ancients
from
this
side
what
several
travellers
had
done
for
explanation
of
the
holy
scriptures
others
had
done
for
homer
by
guys
the
matter
was
introduced
wood
gave
it
an
impulse
a
göttingen
review
of
the
original
work
which
was
at
first
very
rare
made
us
acquainted
with
the
design
and
taught
us
how
far
it
had
been
carried
out
we
now
no
longer
saw
in
those
poems
a
strained
and
inflated
heroism
but
the
reflected
truth
of
a
primeval
present
and
sought
to
bring
this
as
closely
to
us
as
possible
at
the
same
time
we
could
not
give
our
assent
when
it
was
maintained
that
in
order
rightly
to
understand
the
homeric
natures
one
must
make
oneself
acquainted
with
the
wild
races
and
their
manners
as
described
by
the
travellers
in
new
worlds
for
it
can
not
be
denied
that
both
europeans
and
asiatics
are
represented
in
the
homeric
poems
as
at
a
higher
grade
of
culture
perhaps
higher
than
the
time
of
the
trojan
war
could
have
enjoyed
but
that
maxim
was
nevertheless
in
harmony
with
the
prevailing
confession
of
nature
and
so
far
we
let
it
pass
with
all
these
occupations
which
were
related
to
the
knowledge
of
mankind
in
the
higher
sense
as
well
as
most
nearly
and
dearly
to
poetry
i
was
nevertheless
forced
every
day
to
experience
that
i
was
residing
in
wetzlar
the
conversation
on
the
situation
of
the
business
of
the
visitation
and
its
obstacles
the
discovery
of
new
offences
was
heard
every
hour
here
was
the
holy
roman
empire
once
more
assembled
not
for
mere
outward
forms
but
for
an
occupation
which
penetrated
to
the
very
depths
but
even
here
that
on
the
occurred
to
me
where
the
bidden
guests
remained
without
because
they
were
too
proud
here
indeed
they
had
come
but
even
worse
symptoms
were
to
be
seen
the
want
of
coherence
in
the
whole
the
mutual
opposition
of
the
parts
were
continually
apparent
and
it
remained
no
secret
that
princes
had
confidentially
communicated
to
each
other
this
notion
that
they
must
see
whether
on
this
occasion
something
could
not
be
gained
from
the
supreme
authority
what
a
bad
impression
the
petty
detail
of
all
the
anecdotes
of
neglects
and
delays
of
injustices
and
corruptions
must
make
upon
a
young
man
who
desired
what
was
good
and
with
this
view
cultivated
his
mind
every
honest
person
will
feel
under
such
circumstances
where
was
a
reverence
for
the
law
and
the
judge
to
arise
even
if
the
greatest
confidence
had
been
placed
in
the
effects
of
the
visitation
if
it
could
have
been
believed
that
it
would
fully
accomplish
its
high
purpose
there
was
still
no
remedy
to
be
found
here
for
a
joyous
youth
the
formalities
of
the
proceeding
all
tended
towards
delay
if
any
one
desired
to
do
anything
and
to
be
of
any
importance
he
was
obliged
to
serve
the
party
in
the
wrong
always
the
accused
and
to
be
skilled
in
the
of
twisting
and
evading
æsthetic
speculations
since
amid
this
distraction
i
could
not
succeed
in
any
æsthetic
labours
i
again
and
again
lost
myself
in
æsthetic
speculations
as
indeed
all
theorising
indicates
a
defect
or
stagnation
of
productive
power
before
with
merk
now
with
gotter
i
endeavoured
to
find
out
the
maxims
according
to
which
one
might
go
to
work
in
production
but
neither
with
me
nor
with
them
would
it
succeed
merk
was
a
sceptic
and
eclectic
gotter
adhered
to
such
examples
as
pleased
him
the
most
the
sulzer
theory
was
published
more
for
the
amateur
than
the
artist
in
this
sphere
moral
effects
are
required
above
all
things
and
here
at
once
arises
a
dissension
between
the
class
that
produces
and
that
which
uses
for
a
good
work
of
art
can
and
will
indeed
have
moral
consequences
but
to
require
moral
ends
of
the
artist
is
to
destroy
his
profession
what
the
ancients
had
said
on
these
important
subjects
i
had
read
industriously
for
some
years
by
skips
at
least
if
not
in
regular
order
aristotle
cicero
quintilian
longinus
none
were
unconsidered
but
this
did
not
help
me
in
the
least
for
all
these
men
presupposed
an
experience
which
i
lacked
they
led
me
into
a
world
infinitely
rich
in
works
of
art
they
unfolded
the
merits
of
excellent
poets
and
orators
of
most
of
whom
the
names
alone
are
left
us
and
convinced
me
but
too
well
that
a
great
abundance
of
objects
must
lie
before
us
ere
we
can
think
upon
them
that
one
must
first
accomplish
something
oneself
nay
fail
in
something
to
learn
to
know
one
own
capacities
and
those
of
others
my
acquaintance
with
so
much
that
was
good
in
those
old
times
was
only
according
to
school
and
book
and
by
no
means
vital
since
even
with
the
most
celebrated
orators
it
was
striking
that
they
had
altogether
formed
themselves
in
life
and
that
one
could
never
speak
of
the
peculiarities
of
their
character
as
artists
without
at
the
same
time
mentioning
the
personal
peculiarities
of
their
disposition
with
the
poets
this
seemed
less
to
be
the
case
and
thus
the
result
of
all
my
thoughts
and
endeavours
was
the
old
resolution
to
investigate
inner
and
outer
nature
and
to
allow
her
to
rule
herself
in
loving
imitation
for
these
operations
which
rested
in
me
neither
day
nor
night
lay
before
me
two
great
nay
monstrous
materials
the
wealth
of
which
i
had
only
to
prize
in
order
to
produce
something
of
importance
there
was
the
older
epoch
into
which
falls
the
life
of
götz
von
berlichingen
and
the
modern
one
the
unhappy
bloom
of
which
is
depicted
in
of
the
historical
preparation
to
that
first
work
i
have
already
spoken
the
ethical
occasions
of
the
second
shall
now
be
introduced
the
resolution
to
preserve
my
internal
nature
according
to
its
peculiarities
and
to
let
external
nature
influence
me
according
to
its
qualities
impelled
me
to
the
strange
element
in
which
is
designed
and
written
i
sought
to
free
myself
internally
from
all
that
was
foreign
to
me
to
regard
the
external
with
love
and
to
allow
all
beings
from
man
downwards
as
low
as
they
were
comprehensible
to
act
upon
me
each
after
its
own
kind
thus
arose
a
wonderful
affinity
with
the
single
objects
of
nature
and
a
hearty
concord
a
harmony
with
the
whole
so
that
every
change
whether
of
place
and
region
or
of
the
times
of
the
day
and
year
or
whatever
else
could
happen
affected
me
in
the
deepest
manner
the
glance
of
the
painter
associated
itself
to
that
of
the
poet
the
beautiful
rural
landscape
animated
by
the
pleasant
river
increased
my
love
of
solitude
and
favoured
my
silent
observations
as
they
extended
on
all
sides
but
since
i
had
left
the
family
circle
in
sesenheim
and
again
my
family
circle
at
frankfort
and
darmstadt
a
vacuum
had
remained
in
my
bosom
which
i
was
not
able
to
fill
up
i
therefore
found
myself
in
a
situation
where
the
inclinations
if
they
appear
in
any
degree
veiled
gradually
steal
upon
us
and
can
render
abortive
all
our
good
resolutions
and
now
when
the
author
has
attained
this
step
of
his
undertaking
he
for
the
first
time
feels
in
his
labour
since
from
henceforward
this
book
first
becomes
what
it
properly
ought
to
be
it
has
not
been
announced
as
an
independent
work
it
is
much
more
designed
to
fill
up
the
gaps
of
an
author
life
to
complete
much
that
is
fragmentary
and
to
preserve
the
memory
of
lost
and
forgotten
ventures
but
what
is
already
done
neither
should
nor
can
be
repeated
and
the
poet
would
now
vainly
call
upon
those
darkened
powers
of
the
soul
vainly
ask
of
them
to
render
present
again
those
charming
circumstances
which
rendered
the
period
in
lahnthal
so
agreeable
to
him
fortunately
the
genius
had
already
provided
for
that
and
had
impelled
him
in
the
vigorous
period
of
youth
to
hold
fast
describe
and
with
sufficient
boldness
and
at
the
favourable
hour
publicly
to
exhibit
that
which
had
immediately
gone
by
that
the
little
book
is
here
meant
requires
no
further
indication
but
something
is
to
be
gradually
revealed
both
of
the
persons
introduced
in
it
and
the
views
which
it
exhibits
origin
of
werther
among
the
young
men
who
attached
to
the
embassy
had
to
prepare
themselves
for
their
future
career
of
office
was
one
whom
we
were
accustomed
to
call
only
the
bridegroom
he
distinguished
himself
by
a
calm
agreeable
deportment
clearness
of
views
definiteness
both
in
speaking
and
in
acting
his
cheerful
activity
his
persevering
industry
so
much
recommended
him
to
his
superiors
that
an
appointment
at
an
early
period
was
promised
him
being
justified
by
this
he
ventured
to
betroth
himself
to
a
lady
who
fully
corresponded
to
his
tone
of
mind
and
his
wishes
after
the
death
of
her
mother
she
had
shown
herself
extremely
active
as
the
head
of
a
numerous
young
family
and
had
alone
sustained
her
father
in
his
widowhood
so
that
a
future
husband
might
hope
the
same
for
himself
and
his
posterity
and
expect
a
decided
domestic
felicity
every
one
confessed
without
having
these
selfish
ends
immediately
in
view
that
she
was
a
desirable
lady
she
belonged
to
those
who
if
they
do
not
inspire
ardent
passion
are
nevertheless
formed
to
create
a
general
feeling
of
pleasure
a
figure
lightly
built
and
neatly
formed
a
pure
healthy
temperament
with
a
glad
activity
of
life
resulting
from
it
an
unembarrassed
management
of
the
necessities
of
the
day
all
these
were
given
her
together
i
always
felt
happy
in
the
contemplation
of
such
qualities
and
i
readily
associated
myself
to
those
who
possessed
them
and
if
i
did
not
always
find
opportunity
to
render
them
real
service
i
rather
shared
with
them
than
with
others
the
enjoyment
of
those
innocent
pleasures
which
youth
can
always
find
at
hand
and
seize
without
any
great
cost
or
effort
moreover
since
it
is
now
settled
that
ladies
decorate
themselves
only
for
each
other
and
are
unwearied
among
each
other
to
heighten
the
effect
of
their
adornments
those
were
always
the
most
agreeable
to
me
who
with
simple
purity
give
their
friend
their
bridegroom
the
silent
assurance
that
all
is
really
done
for
him
alone
and
that
a
whole
life
could
be
so
carried
on
without
much
circumstance
and
outlay
such
persons
are
not
too
much
occupied
with
themselves
they
have
time
to
consider
the
external
world
and
patience
enough
to
direct
themselves
according
to
it
and
to
adapt
themselves
to
it
they
become
shrewd
and
sensible
without
exertion
and
require
but
few
books
for
their
cultivation
such
was
the
bride
the
bridegroom
with
his
thoroughly
upright
and
confiding
turn
of
mind
soon
made
many
whom
he
esteemed
acquainted
with
her
and
as
he
had
to
pass
the
greatest
part
of
his
day
in
a
zealous
attention
to
business
was
pleased
when
his
betrothed
after
the
domestic
toils
were
ended
amused
herself
otherwise
and
took
social
recreation
in
walks
and
rural
parties
with
friends
of
both
sexes
lottie
for
so
we
shall
call
her
was
unpretending
in
two
senses
first
by
her
nature
which
was
rather
directed
to
a
general
kindly
feeling
than
to
particular
inclinations
and
then
she
had
set
her
mind
upon
a
man
who
being
worthy
of
her
declared
himself
ready
to
attach
his
fate
to
hers
for
life
the
most
cheerful
atmosphere
seemed
to
surround
her
nay
if
it
be
a
pleasing
sight
to
see
parents
bestow
an
uninterrupted
care
upon
their
children
there
is
something
still
more
beautiful
when
brothers
and
sisters
do
the
same
for
each
other
in
the
former
case
we
think
we
can
perceive
more
of
natural
impulse
and
social
tradition
in
the
latter
more
of
choice
and
of
a
free
exercise
of
feeling
the
new
comer
perfectly
free
from
all
ties
and
careless
in
the
presence
of
a
girl
who
already
engaged
to
another
could
not
interpret
the
most
obliging
services
as
acts
of
courtship
and
could
take
the
more
pleasure
in
them
accordingly
quietly
went
his
way
but
was
soon
so
drawn
in
and
rivetted
that
he
no
longer
knew
himself
indolent
and
dreamy
because
nothing
present
satisfied
him
he
found
what
he
had
lacked
in
a
female
friend
who
while
she
lived
for
the
whole
year
seemed
only
to
live
for
the
moment
she
liked
him
much
as
her
companion
he
soon
could
not
bear
her
absence
as
she
formed
for
him
the
connecting
link
with
the
world
and
during
extensive
household
occupations
they
were
inseparable
companions
in
the
fields
and
in
the
meadows
in
the
and
in
the
garden
if
business
permitted
the
bridegroom
was
also
of
the
party
they
had
all
three
accustomed
themselves
to
each
other
without
intention
and
did
not
know
how
they
had
become
so
mutually
indispensable
during
the
splendid
summer
they
lived
through
a
real
german
idyl
to
which
the
fertile
land
gave
the
form
and
a
pure
affection
the
poetry
wandering
through
ripe
they
took
delight
in
the
dewy
morning
the
song
of
the
lark
the
cry
of
the
quail
were
pleasant
tones
sultry
hours
followed
monstrous
storms
came
on
they
grew
more
and
more
attached
to
each
other
and
by
this
continuous
love
many
a
little
domestic
annoyance
was
easily
extinguished
and
thus
one
ordinary
day
followed
another
and
all
seemed
to
be
holidays
the
whole
calendar
should
have
been
printed
red
he
will
understand
me
who
recollects
what
was
predicted
by
the
happily
unhappy
friend
of
the
new
heloise
and
sitting
at
the
feet
of
his
beloved
he
will
break
hemp
and
he
will
wish
to
break
hemp
and
the
day
after
nay
for
his
whole
life
young
jerusalem
i
can
say
but
little
though
just
as
much
as
may
be
necessary
respecting
a
young
man
whose
name
was
afterwards
but
too
often
mentioned
this
was
jerusalem
the
son
of
the
freely
and
tenderly
thinking
theologian
he
also
had
an
appointment
with
an
embassy
his
form
was
pleasing
of
a
middle
height
and
well
built
his
face
was
rather
round
than
long
his
features
were
soft
and
calm
and
he
had
the
other
appurtenances
of
a
handsome
blond
youth
with
blue
eyes
rather
attractive
than
speaking
his
dress
was
that
introduced
in
lower
germany
in
imitation
of
the
english
a
blue
frock
waistcoat
and
breeches
of
yellow
leather
and
boots
with
brown
tops
the
author
never
visited
him
nor
saw
him
at
his
own
residence
but
often
met
him
among
his
friends
the
expressions
of
this
young
man
were
moderate
but
kindly
he
took
interest
in
productions
of
the
most
different
kinds
and
especially
loved
those
designs
and
sketches
in
which
the
the
tranquil
character
of
solitary
spots
is
caught
on
such
occasions
he
showed
gesner
etchings
and
encouraged
the
amateurs
to
study
them
in
all
that
mummery
and
knighthood
he
took
no
part
but
lived
for
himself
and
his
own
sentiments
it
was
said
he
had
a
decided
passion
for
the
wife
of
one
of
as
friends
in
public
they
were
never
seen
together
in
general
very
little
could
be
said
of
him
except
that
he
occupied
himself
with
english
literature
as
the
son
of
an
opulent
man
he
had
no
occasion
either
painfully
to
devote
himself
to
business
or
to
make
pressing
applications
for
an
early
appointment
those
etchings
by
gesner
increased
the
pleasure
and
interest
in
rural
objects
and
a
little
poem
which
we
passionately
received
into
our
circle
allowed
us
from
henceforward
to
think
of
nothing
else
goldsmith
necessarily
delighted
every
one
at
that
grade
of
cultivation
in
that
sphere
of
thought
not
as
living
and
active
but
as
a
departed
vanished
existence
was
described
all
that
one
so
readily
looked
upon
that
one
loved
prized
sought
passionately
in
the
present
to
take
part
in
it
with
the
cheerfulness
of
youth
highdays
and
holidays
in
the
country
church
consecrations
and
fairs
the
solemn
assemblage
of
the
elders
under
the
village
supplanted
in
its
turn
by
the
lively
delight
of
youth
in
dancing
while
the
more
educated
classes
show
their
sympathy
how
seemly
did
these
pleasures
appear
moderated
as
they
were
by
an
excellent
country
pastor
who
understood
how
to
smooth
down
and
remove
all
that
went
too
far
that
gave
occasion
to
quarrel
and
dispute
here
again
we
found
an
honest
wakefield
in
his
circle
yet
no
longer
in
his
living
bodily
form
but
as
a
shadow
recalled
by
the
soft
mournful
tones
of
the
elegiac
poet
the
very
thought
of
this
picture
is
one
of
the
happiest
possible
when
once
the
design
is
formed
to
evoke
once
more
an
innocent
past
with
a
graceful
melancholy
and
in
this
kindly
endeavour
how
well
has
the
englishman
succeeded
in
every
sense
of
the
word
i
shared
the
enthusiasm
for
this
charming
poem
with
gotter
who
was
more
felicitous
than
myself
with
the
translation
undertaken
by
us
both
for
i
had
too
painfully
tried
to
imitate
in
our
language
the
delicate
significance
of
the
original
and
thus
had
well
agreed
with
single
passages
but
not
with
the
whole
if
now
as
they
say
the
greatest
happiness
rests
on
a
sense
of
longing
and
if
the
genuine
longing
can
only
be
directed
to
something
unattainable
everything
had
fallen
together
to
render
the
youth
whom
we
now
accompany
on
his
wanderings
the
happiest
of
mortals
an
affection
for
one
betrothed
to
another
the
effort
to
acquire
the
masterpieces
of
foreign
literature
for
our
own
the
endeavour
to
imitate
natural
objects
not
only
with
words
but
also
with
style
and
pencil
without
any
proper
technical
knowledge
each
of
these
particulars
would
singly
have
sufficed
to
me
melt
the
heart
and
oppress
the
bosom
but
that
the
sweetly
suffering
youth
might
be
torn
out
of
this
state
and
that
new
circumstances
might
be
prepared
for
new
disquiet
the
following
events
occurred
höpfner
höpfner
professor
of
law
was
at
giessen
he
was
acknowledged
and
highly
esteemed
by
merck
and
schlosser
as
clever
in
his
office
and
as
a
thinking
and
excellent
man
i
had
long
ago
desired
his
acquaintance
and
now
when
these
two
friends
thought
to
pay
him
a
visit
to
negotiate
about
some
literary
matters
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
likewise
go
to
giessen
on
this
opportunity
because
however
as
generally
happens
with
the
wilfulness
of
glad
and
peaceful
times
we
could
not
easily
do
anything
in
the
direct
way
but
like
genuine
children
sought
to
get
a
jest
even
out
of
what
was
necessary
i
was
now
as
an
unknown
person
to
appear
in
a
strange
form
and
once
more
satisfy
my
desire
to
appear
disguised
one
cheerful
morning
before
sunrise
i
went
from
wetzlar
along
the
lahne
up
the
charming
valley
such
ramblings
again
constituted
my
greatest
felicity
i
invented
connected
elaborated
and
was
quietly
happy
and
cheerful
with
myself
i
set
right
what
the
world
had
clumsily
and
confusedly
forced
upon
me
arrived
at
the
end
of
my
journey
i
looked
out
for
höpfner
residence
and
knocked
at
his
study
when
he
had
cried
out
come
in
i
modestly
appeared
before
him
as
a
student
who
was
going
home
from
the
universities
and
wished
on
his
way
to
become
acquainted
with
the
most
worthy
men
for
his
questions
as
to
my
more
intimate
circumstances
i
was
prepared
i
made
up
a
plausible
prosaic
tale
with
which
he
seemed
satisfied
and
as
i
gave
myself
out
for
a
jurist
i
did
not
come
off
badly
for
i
well
knew
his
merits
in
this
department
and
also
that
he
was
occupied
with
natural
law
conversation
however
sometimes
came
to
a
stand
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
looking
for
a
or
for
me
to
take
my
leave
nevertheless
i
managed
to
delay
my
departure
as
i
expected
with
certainty
the
arrival
of
schlosser
whose
punctuality
was
well
known
to
me
he
came
in
reality
and
after
a
side
glance
took
little
notice
of
me
höpfner
however
drew
me
into
conversation
and
showed
himself
throughout
as
a
humane
and
kindly
man
i
at
last
took
my
leave
and
hastened
to
the
inn
where
i
exchanged
a
few
hurried
words
with
merck
and
awaited
further
proceedings
the
friends
had
resolved
to
ask
höpfner
to
dinner
and
also
that
christian
heinrich
schmidt
who
had
played
a
part
though
a
very
subordinate
one
in
german
literature
for
him
the
affair
was
really
designed
and
he
was
to
be
punished
in
a
mirthful
manner
when
the
guests
had
assembled
in
the
i
asked
through
the
waiter
whether
the
gentlemen
would
allow
me
to
dine
with
them
schlosser
whom
a
certain
earnestness
well
became
opposed
this
proposition
because
they
did
not
wish
their
conversation
interrupted
by
a
third
party
but
on
the
pressing
demand
of
the
waiter
and
the
advocacy
of
höpfner
who
assured
the
other
that
i
was
a
very
tolerable
person
i
was
admitted
and
at
the
commencement
of
the
meal
behaved
as
if
modest
and
abashed
schlosser
and
merck
put
no
restraint
upon
themselves
and
went
on
about
many
subjects
as
freely
as
if
no
stranger
were
present
i
now
showed
myself
somewhat
bolder
and
did
not
allow
myself
to
be
disturbed
when
schlosser
threw
out
at
me
much
that
was
in
earnest
and
merck
something
sarcastic
but
i
directed
against
schmidt
all
my
darts
which
fell
sharply
and
surely
on
the
uncovered
places
which
i
well
knew
i
had
been
moderate
over
my
pint
of
but
the
gentlemen
ordered
better
wine
to
be
brought
and
did
not
fail
to
give
me
some
after
many
affairs
of
the
day
had
been
talked
over
conversation
went
into
general
matters
and
the
question
was
discussed
which
will
be
repeated
as
long
as
there
are
authors
in
the
world
the
question
namely
whether
literature
was
rising
or
declining
progressing
or
retrograding
this
question
about
which
old
and
young
those
commencing
and
those
retiring
seldom
agree
was
discussed
with
cheerfulness
though
without
any
exact
design
of
coming
decidedly
to
terms
about
it
at
last
i
took
up
the
discourse
and
said
the
different
literatures
as
it
seems
to
me
have
seasons
which
alternating
with
each
other
as
in
nature
bring
forth
certain
phenomena
and
assert
themselves
in
due
order
hence
i
do
not
believe
that
any
epoch
of
a
literature
can
be
praised
or
blamed
on
the
whole
especially
it
displeases
me
when
certain
talents
which
are
brought
out
by
their
time
are
raised
and
vaunted
so
highly
while
others
are
censured
and
depreciated
the
throat
of
the
nightingale
is
excited
by
the
spring
but
at
the
same
time
also
that
of
the
cuckoo
the
butterflies
which
are
so
agreeable
to
the
eye
and
the
gnats
which
are
so
painful
to
the
feelings
are
called
into
being
by
the
same
heat
of
the
sun
if
this
were
duly
considered
we
should
not
hear
the
same
complaints
renewed
every
ten
years
and
the
vain
trouble
which
is
taken
to
root
out
this
or
that
offensive
thing
would
not
so
often
be
wasted
the
party
looked
at
me
wondering
whence
i
had
got
so
much
wisdom
and
tolerance
i
however
continued
quite
calmly
to
compare
literary
phenomena
with
natural
productions
and
i
know
not
how
came
to
the
of
which
i
contrived
to
set
forth
all
sorts
of
strange
things
i
said
that
there
were
creatures
to
whom
a
sort
of
body
nay
a
certain
figure
could
not
be
denied
but
that
since
they
had
no
bones
one
never
knew
how
to
set
about
rightly
with
them
and
they
were
nothing
better
than
living
slime
nevertheless
the
sea
must
have
such
inhabitants
since
i
carried
the
simile
beyond
its
due
limits
to
designate
schmidt
who
was
present
and
that
class
of
characterless
i
was
reminded
that
a
simile
carried
too
far
at
last
becomes
nothing
well
then
i
will
return
to
the
earth
i
replied
and
speak
of
the
ivy
as
these
creatures
have
no
bones
so
this
has
no
trunk
but
wherever
it
attaches
itself
it
likes
to
play
the
chief
part
it
belongs
to
old
walls
in
which
there
is
nothing
more
to
destroy
but
from
new
buildings
it
is
properly
removed
it
sucks
up
the
goodness
of
the
trees
and
is
most
insupportable
to
me
when
it
clambers
up
a
post
and
assures
me
that
this
is
a
living
trunk
because
it
has
covered
it
with
leaves
joke
upon
h
schmidt
notwithstanding
i
was
again
reproached
with
the
obscurity
and
inapplicability
of
my
similes
i
became
more
and
more
warm
against
all
parasitical
creatures
and
as
far
as
my
knowledge
of
nature
then
extended
managed
the
affair
pretty
well
i
at
last
sang
a
to
all
independent
men
a
to
those
who
forced
themselves
upon
them
seized
höpfner
hand
after
dinner
shook
it
violently
declared
him
to
be
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
finally
embraced
both
him
and
the
others
right
heartily
my
excellent
new
friend
thought
he
was
really
dreaming
until
schlosser
and
merk
at
last
solved
the
riddle
and
the
discovered
joke
diffused
a
general
hilarity
which
was
shared
by
schmidt
himself
who
was
appeased
by
an
acknowledgment
of
his
real
merits
and
the
interest
we
took
in
his
tastes
this
ingenious
introduction
could
not
do
otherwise
than
animate
and
favour
the
literary
congress
which
was
indeed
chiefly
kept
in
view
merck
active
now
in
æsthetics
now
in
literature
now
in
commerce
had
stimulated
the
schlosser
whose
knowledge
extended
to
so
many
branches
to
edit
the
frankfort
for
that
year
they
had
associated
to
themselves
höpfner
and
other
in
giessen
a
meritorious
schoolman
rector
wenk
in
darmstadt
and
many
other
good
men
every
one
of
them
possessed
enough
historical
and
theoretical
knowledge
in
his
department
and
the
feeling
of
the
times
allowed
these
men
to
work
in
one
spirit
the
human
and
cosmopolitan
is
encouraged
really
good
men
justly
celebrated
are
protected
against
obtrusion
of
every
kind
their
defence
is
undertaken
against
enemies
and
especially
against
scholars
who
use
what
has
been
taught
them
to
the
detriment
of
their
instructors
nearly
the
most
interesting
articles
are
the
critiques
on
other
periodical
publications
the
the
where
the
cleverness
in
so
many
departments
the
judgment
as
well
the
fairness
of
the
papers
is
rightly
admired
as
for
myself
they
saw
well
enough
that
i
was
deficient
in
everything
that
belongs
to
a
critic
properly
so
called
my
historical
knowledge
was
unconnected
the
histories
of
the
world
science
and
literature
had
only
attracted
me
by
epochs
the
objects
themselves
only
partially
and
in
masses
my
capacity
of
giving
life
to
things
and
rendering
them
present
to
me
out
of
their
real
connexion
put
me
in
the
position
that
i
could
be
perfectly
at
home
in
a
certain
century
or
in
a
department
of
science
without
being
in
any
degree
instructed
as
to
what
preceded
or
what
followed
thus
a
certain
sense
had
been
awakened
in
me
by
which
i
could
give
account
of
things
rather
as
they
should
be
than
as
they
were
without
any
proper
philosophical
connection
but
by
way
of
leaps
to
this
was
added
a
very
easy
power
of
apprehension
and
a
friendly
reception
of
the
opinions
of
others
if
they
did
not
stand
in
direct
opposition
to
my
own
convictions
frankfort

that
literary
union
was
also
favoured
by
an
animated
correspondence
and
by
frequent
personal
communication
which
was
possible
from
the
vicinity
of
the
places
he
who
had
first
read
a
book
was
to
give
an
account
of
it
often
another
reviewer
of
the
same
book
was
found
the
affair
was
talked
over
connected
with
kindred
subjects
and
if
at
last
a
certain
result
had
been
obtained
one
of
them
took
the
office
of
editing
thus
many
reviews
are
as
clever
as
they
are
spirited
as
pleasant
as
they
are
satisfactory
i
often
had
the
task
of
introducing
the
matter
my
friends
also
permitted
me
to
jest
in
their
works
and
to
appear
independently
with
objects
to
which
i
felt
myself
equal
and
in
which
i
especially
took
interest
in
vain
should
i
endeavour
either
by
description
or
reflection
to
recall
the
proper
spirit
and
sense
of
those
days
if
the
two
years
of
the
periodical
did
not
furnish
me
with
the
most
decisive
documents
extracts
from
passages
in
which
i
again
recognise
myself
may
appear
in
future
in
their
proper
place
together
with
similar
essays
during
this
lively
interchange
of
knowledge
opinions
and
convictions
i
very
soon
became
better
acquainted
with
höpfner
and
became
very
fond
of
him
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
i
spoke
with
him
about
subjects
connected
with
his
department
which
was
to
be
my
department
also
and
found
a
very
naturally
connected
explanation
and
instruction
i
was
not
then
as
yet
plainly
conscious
that
i
could
learn
something
from
books
and
conversation
but
not
from
continuous
professional
lectures
a
book
allowed
me
to
pause
at
a
passage
and
even
to
look
back
which
is
impossible
with
oral
delivery
and
a
teacher
often
at
the
beginning
of
the
lecture
some
thought
in
which
i
indulged
laid
hold
of
me
and
thus
i
lost
what
followed
and
altogether
got
out
of
the
connexion
thus
it
had
happened
to
me
with
respect
to
the
lectures
on
jurisprudence
and
on
this
account
i
could
take
many
opportunities
of
talking
with
höpfner
who
entered
very
readily
into
my
doubts
and
scruples
and
filled
up
many
gaps
so
that
the
wish
arose
in
me
to
remain
with
him
at
giessen
and
derive
instruction
from
him
without
removing
myself
too
far
from
wetzlar
inclinations
against
this
wish
of
mine
my
two
friends
had
laboured
first
unconsciously
but
afterwards
consciously
for
both
were
in
a
hurry
not
only
to
leave
the
place
themselves
but
had
also
an
interest
to
remove
me
from
the
spot
schlosser
disclosed
to
me
that
he
had
formed
first
a
friendly
then
a
closer
connexion
with
my
sister
and
that
he
was
looking
about
for
an
early
appointment
that
he
might
be
united
to
her
this
explanation
surprised
me
to
some
degree
although
i
ought
to
have
found
it
out
long
ago
in
my
sister
letters
but
we
easily
pass
over
that
which
may
hurt
the
good
opinion
which
we
entertain
of
ourselves
and
i
now
remarked
for
the
first
time
that
i
was
really
jealous
about
my
sister
a
feeling
which
i
concealed
from
myself
the
less
as
since
my
return
from
strasburg
our
connexion
had
been
much
more
intimate
how
much
time
had
we
not
expended
in
communicating
each
little
affair
of
the
heart
and
other
matters
which
had
occurred
in
the
interval
in
the
field
of
imagination
too
had
there
not
been
revealed
to
me
a
new
world
into
which
i
sought
to
conduct
her
also
my
own
little
productions
and
a
was
gradually
to
be
made
known
to
her
thus
i
made
for
her
translations
of
those
passages
of
homer
in
which
she
could
take
the
greatest
interest
clarke
literal
translation
i
read
into
german
as
well
as
i
could
my
version
generally
found
its
way
into
metrical
turns
and
terminations
and
the
liveliness
with
which
i
had
apprehended
the
images
the
force
with
which
i
expressed
them
removed
all
the
obstacles
of
a
cramped
order
of
words
what
i
gave
with
mind
she
followed
with
mind
also
we
passed
many
hours
of
the
day
in
this
fashion
while
if
her
company
met
the
wolf
fenris
and
the
ape
hannemann
were
unanimously
called
for
and
how
often
have
i
not
been
obliged
to
repeat
circumstantially
how
thor
and
his
comrades
were
deluded
by
the
magical
giants
hence
from
these
fictions
such
a
pleasant
impression
has
remained
with
me
that
they
belong
to
the
most
valuable
things
which
my
imagination
can
recall
into
the
connexion
with
the
darmstadt
people
i
had
drawn
my
sister
also
and
now
my
wanderings
and
occasional
absence
necessarily
bound
us
closer
together
as
i
discoursed
with
her
by
letter
respecting
every
thing
that
occurred
to
me
communicated
to
her
every
little
poem
if
even
only
a
note
of
admiration
and
let
her
first
see
all
the
letters
which
i
received
and
all
the
answers
which
i
wrote
all
these
lively
impulses
had
been
stopped
since
my
departure
from
frankfort
my
residence
at
wetzlar
was
not
fertile
enough
such
a
correspondence
and
moreover
my
attachment
to
charlotte
may
have
infringed
upon
my
attentions
to
my
sister
enough
she
felt
herself
alone
perhaps
neglected
and
therefore
the
more
readily
gave
a
hearing
to
the
honest
wooing
of
an
honourable
man
who
serious
and
reserved
estimable
and
worthy
of
confidence
had
passionately
bestowed
on
her
his
affections
with
which
he
was
otherwise
very
niggardly
i
was
now
forced
to
resign
myself
and
grant
my
friend
his
happiness
though
i
did
not
fail
in
secret
to
say
confidently
to
myself
that
if
the
brother
had
not
been
absent
it
would
not
have
gone
so
well
with
the
friend
my
friend
and
probable
was
now
very
anxious
that
i
should
return
home
because
by
my
mediation
a
freer
intercourse
was
possible
of
which
the
feelings
of
this
man
so
unexpectedly
attacked
by
a
tender
passion
seemed
to
stand
extremely
in
need
therefore
on
his
speedy
departure
he
elicited
from
me
the
promise
that
i
would
immediately
follow
him
merck
hatred
of
students
of
merck
whose
time
was
free
i
hoped
that
he
would
delay
his
sojourn
in
giessen
that
i
might
be
able
to
pass
some
hours
of
the
day
with
my
good
höpfner
while
my
friend
employed
his
time
on
the
frankfort
but
he
was
not
to
be
moved
and
as
my
was
driven
from
the
university
by
love
he
was
driven
by
hate
for
as
there
are
innate
antipathies
just
as
certain
men
can
not
endure
cats
while
this
or
that
is
repugnant
to
the
soul
of
others
so
was
merk
a
deadly
enemy
to
all
the
academical
citizens
the
students
who
indeed
at
that
time
at
giessen
took
delight
in
the
greatest
rudeness
for
me
they
were
well
enough
i
could
have
used
them
as
masks
for
one
of
my
carnival
plays
but
with
him
the
sight
of
them
by
day
and
their
noise
by
night
destroyed
every
sort
of
good
humour
he
had
spent
the
best
days
of
his
youth
in
french
switzerland
and
had
afterwards
enjoyed
the
pleasant
intercourse
of
people
of
the
court
world
and
business
and
of
cultivated
several
military
persons
in
whom
a
desire
for
mental
culture
had
been
awakened
sought
his
society
and
thus
he
had
passed
his
life
in
a
very
cultivated
circle
that
the
rudeness
of
the
students
vexed
him
was
therefore
not
to
be
wondered
at
but
his
aversion
from
them
was
really
more
passionate
than
became
a
sound
man
although
he
often
made
me
laugh
by
his
witty
descriptions
of
their
monstrous
appearance
and
behaviour
höpfner
imitations
and
my
persuasions
were
of
no
avail
i
was
obliged
to
depart
with
him
as
soon
as
possible
for
wetzlar
i
could
scarcely
wait
any
time
till
i
had
introduced
him
to
charlotte
but
his
presence
in
this
circle
did
me
no
good
for
as
mephistopheles
let
him
go
when
he
will
hardly
brings
a
blessing
with
him
so
did
he
by
his
indifference
towards
that
beloved
person
cause
me
no
joy
even
if
he
did
not
make
me
waver
this
i
might
have
foreseen
if
i
had
recollected
that
it
was
exactly
those
slender
delicate
persons
who
diffuse
a
lively
cheerfulness
around
them
without
making
further
pretensions
who
did
not
remarkably
please
him
he
very
quickly
preferred
the
of
one
of
her
friends
and
since
he
lacked
time
to
form
a
close
connexion
he
bitterly
blamed
me
for
not
exerting
myself
to
gain
this
magnificent
figure
especially
as
she
was
free
and
without
any
tie
he
thought
that
i
did
not
understand
my
own
advantage
and
that
he
here
very
unwillingly
perceived
my
especial
taste
for
wasting
my
time
if
it
is
dangerous
to
make
a
friend
acquainted
with
the
perfections
of
one
beloved
because
he
also
may
find
her
charming
and
desirable
no
less
is
the
reverse
danger
that
he
may
perplex
us
by
his
dissent
this
indeed
was
not
the
case
here
for
i
had
too
deeply
impressed
upon
myself
the
picture
of
her
amiability
for
it
to
be
so
easily
obliterated
but
his
presence
and
his
persuasions
nevertheless
hastened
my
resolution
to
leave
the
place
he
represented
to
me
a
journey
on
the
rhine
which
he
was
going
to
take
with
his
wife
and
son
in
the
most
glowing
colours
and
excited
in
me
the
desire
to
see
at
last
with
my
eyes
those
objects
of
which
i
had
often
heard
with
envy
now
when
he
had
departed
i
separated
myself
from
charlotte
with
a
purer
conscience
indeed
than
from
frederica
but
still
not
without
pain
this
connexion
also
had
by
habit
and
indulgence
grown
more
passionate
than
was
right
on
my
side
while
on
the
other
hand
she
and
her
bridegroom
kept
themselves
with
cheerfulness
in
a
measure
which
could
not
be
more
beautiful
and
amiable
and
the
security
which
resulted
just
from
this
caused
me
to
forget
every
danger
i
could
not
however
conceal
from
myself
that
this
adventure
must
come
to
a
speedy
end
for
the
union
of
the
young
man
with
the
amiable
girl
depended
on
a
promotion
which
was
immediately
to
be
expected
and
as
man
if
he
is
in
any
degree
resolute
even
dares
to
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
so
did
i
embrace
the
determination
voluntarily
to
depart
before
i
was
driven
away
by
anything
insupportable
annual
publications
devoted
to
poetry
the
fight
of
hermann
the
arminius
of
tacitus
against
the
persons
betrothed
are
in
german
called

and

a
stammbuch
is

of

and

it
was
agreed
with
merck
that
in
the
fine
season
we
should
meet
at
coblentz
at
frau
von
laroche
i
sent
to
frankfort
my
baggage
and
whatever
i
might
want
on
my
way
down
the
lahn
by
an
opportunity
which
offered
and
now
wandered
down
that
beautiful
river
so
lovely
in
its
windings
so
various
in
its
shores
free
as
to
my
resolution
but
oppressed
as
to
my
feelings
in
a
condition
when
the
presence
of
nature
is
so
beneficial
to
us
my
eye
accustomed
to
discern
those
beauties
of
a
landscape
that
suited
the
painter
and
were
above
him
rioted
in
the
contemplation
of
near
and
distant
objects
of
bushy
rocks
of
sunny
heights
of
damp
valleys
of
enthroned
castles
and
of
the
blue
range
of
mountains
inviting
us
from
the
distance
i
wandered
on
the
right
bank
of
the
river
which
at
some
depth
and
distance
below
me
and
partly
concealed
by
a
rich
bush
of
willows
glided
along
in
the
sunlight
then
again
arose
in
me
the
old
wish
worthily
to
imitate
such
objects
by
chance
i
had
a
handsome
in
my
left
hand
and
at
the
moment
from
the
depth
of
my
soul
arose
as
it
were
an
absolute
command
according
to
which
without
delay
i
was
to
fling
this
knife
into
the
river
if
i
saw
it
fall
my
wish
to
become
an
artist
would
be
fulfilled
but
if
the
sinking
of
the
knife
was
concealed
by
the
overhanging
bush
of
willows
i
was
to
abandon
the
wish
and
the
endeavour
this
whim
had
no
sooner
arisen
in
me
than
it
was
executed
for
without
regarding
the
usefulness
of
the
knife
which
comprised
many
instruments
in
itself
i
cast
it
with
the
left
hand
as
i
held
it
violently
towards
the
river
but
here
i
had
to
experience
that
deceptive
ambiguity
of
oracles
of
which
in
antiquity
such
bitter
complaints
were
made
the
sinking
of
the
knife
into
the
water
was
concealed
from
me
by
the
extreme
twigs
of
the
willows
but
the
water
which
rose
from
the
fall
sprang
up
like
a
strong
fountain
and
was
perfectly
visible
i
did
not
interpret
this
phenomenon
in
my
favour
and
the
doubt
which
it
excited
in
me
was
afterwards
the
cause
that
i
pursued
these
exercises
more
interruptedly
and
more
negligently
and
gave
occasion
for
the
import
of
the
oracle
to
fulfil
itself
for
the
moment
at
least
the
external
world
was
spoiled
for
me
i
abandoned
myself
to
my
imaginations
and
feelings
and
left
the
castles
and
districts
of
weilburg
limburg
diez
and
nassau
one
by
one
behind
me
generally
walking
alone
but
often
for
a
short
time
associating
myself
with
another
the
family
von
laroche
after
thus
pleasantly
wandering
for
some
days
i
arrived
at
ems
where
i
several
times
enjoyed
the
soft
bath
and
then
went
down
the
river
in
a
boat
then
the
old
rhine
opened
itself
upon
me
the
beautiful
situation
of
oberlahnstein
delighted
me
but
noble
and
majestic
above
all
appeared
to
me
the
castle
ehrenbreitstein
which
stood
perfectly
armed
in
its
power
and
strength
in
most
lovely
contrast
lay
at
its
feet
the
little
place
called
thal
where
i
could
easily
find
my
way
to
the
residence
of
privy
councillor
von
laroche
announced
by
merck
i
was
very
kindly
received
by
this
noble
family
and
soon
considered
as
a
member
of
it
my
literary
and
sentimental
tendencies
bound
me
to
the
mother
a
cheerful
feeling
for
the
world
bound
me
to
the
father
and
my
youth
bound
me
to
the
daughters
the
house
quite
at
the
end
of
the
valley
and
little
elevated
above
the
river
had
a
free
prospect
down
the
stream
the
rooms
were
high
and
spacious
and
the
walls
like
a
gallery
were
hung
with
pictures
placed
close
together
every
window
on
every
side
formed
a
frame
to
a
natural
picture
which
came
out
by
the
light
of
a
mild
sun
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
such
cheerful
mornings
and
such
splendid
evenings
i
was
not
long
the
only
guest
in
the
house
as
a
member
of
the
congress
which
was
held
here
partly
with
an
artistic
view
partly
as
a
matter
of
feeling
leuchselring
who
came
up
from
düsseldorf
was
likewise
appointed
this
man
possessing
a
fine
knowledge
of
modern
literature
had
on
different
travels
but
especially
during
a
residence
in
switzerland
made
many
acquaintances
and
as
he
was
pleasant
and
insinuating
had
gained
much
favour
he
carried
with
him
several
boxes
which
contained
the
confidential
correspondence
with
many
friends
for
there
was
altogether
such
a
general
openness
among
people
that
one
could
not
speak
or
write
to
a
single
individual
without
considering
it
directed
to
many
one
explored
one
own
heart
and
that
of
others
and
with
the
indifference
of
the
government
towards
such
a
communication
the
great
rapidity
of
the
taxisch
post
the
security
of
the
seal
and
the
reasonableness
of
the
postage
this
moral
and
literary
intercourse
soon
spread
itself
around
such
correspondences
especially
with
important
persons
were
carefully
collected
and
extracts
from
them
were
often
read
at
friendly
meetings
thus
as
political
discourses
had
little
interest
one
became
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
extent
of
the
moral
world
leuchselring
boxes
contained
many
treasures
in
this
sense
the
letters
of
one
julie
bondeli
were
very
much
esteemed
she
was
famed
as
a
lady
of
sense
and
merit
and
a
friend
of
rousseau
whoever
had
stood
in
any
relation
to
this
extraordinary
man
took
part
in
the
glory
which
emanated
from
him
and
in
his
name
a
silent
community
had
been
disseminated
far
and
wide
i
liked
to
be
present
at
these
readings
as
i
was
thus
transported
into
an
unknown
world
and
learned
to
know
the
real
truth
of
many
an
event
that
had
just
passed
all
indeed
was
not
valuable
and
herr
von
laroche
a
cheerful
man
of
the
world
and
of
business
who
although
a
catholic
had
already
in
his
writings
made
free
with
the
monks
and
priesthood
thought
that
he
here
saw
a
fraternity
where
many
a
worthless
individual
supported
himself
by
a
connexion
with
persons
of
importance
by
which
in
the
end
he
but
not
they
were
admired
generally
this
excellent
man
withdrew
from
the
company
when
the
boxes
were
opened
even
if
he
did
listen
to
some
letters
now
and
then
a
waggish
remark
was
to
be
expected
among
other
things
he
once
said
that
by
this
correspondence
he
was
still
more
convinced
of
what
he
had
always
believed
namely
that
ladies
might
spare
their
as
they
need
only
fasten
their
letters
with
pins
and
might
be
assured
that
they
would
reach
their
address
unopened
in
the
same
way
he
was
accustomed
to
jest
with
everything
that
lay
out
of
the
sphere
of
life
and
activity
and
in
this
followed
the
disposition
of
his
lord
and
master
count
stadion
minister
to
the
elector
of
mayence
who
certainly
was
not
fitted
to
counterbalance
the
worldliness
and
coldness
of
the
boy
by
a
reverence
for
everything
like
mysterious
foreboding
herr
von
laroche
and
his
preceptor
an
anecdote
respecting
the
great
practical
sense
of
the
count
may
here
find
a
place
when
he
took
a
liking
to
the
orphan
laroche
and
chose
him
for
a
pupil
he
at
once
required
from
the
boy
the
services
of
a
secretary
he
gave
him
letters
to
answer
despatches
to
prepare
which
he
was
then
obliged
to
copy
fair
oftener
to
write
in
cipher
to
seal
and
to
direct
this
lasted
for
many
years
when
the
boy
had
grown
up
into
a
youth
and
really
did
that
which
he
had
hitherto
only
supposed
he
was
doing
the
count
took
him
to
a
large
in
which
all
his
letters
and
packets
lay
unbroken
having
been
preserved
as
exercises
of
the
former
time
another
exercise
which
the
count
required
of
his
pupil
will
not
find
such
universal
applause
laroche
had
been
obliged
to
practise
himself
in
imitating
as
accurately
as
possible
the
handwriting
of
his
lord
and
master
that
he
might
thus
relieve
him
from
the
trouble
of
writing
himself
not
only
in
business
but
also
in
love
affairs
the
young
man
had
to
take
the
place
of
his
preceptor
the
count
was
passionately
attached
to
a
lady
of
rank
and
talent
if
he
stopped
in
her
society
till
late
at
night
his
secretary
was
in
the
meanwhile
sitting
at
home
and
hammering
out
the
most
ardent
the
count
chose
one
of
these
and
sent
it
that
very
night
to
his
beloved
who
was
thus
necessarily
convinced
of
the
inextinguishable
fire
of
her
passionate
adorer
such
early
experiences
were
scarcely
fitted
to
give
the
youth
the
most
exalted
notion
of
written
communications
about
love
an
irreconcilable
hatred
of
the
priesthood
had
established
itself
in
this
man
who
served
two
spiritual
electors
and
had
probably
sprung
from
the
contemplation
of
the
rude
tasteless
foolery
which
the
monks
in
germany
were
accustomed
to
carry
on
in
many
parts
and
thus
hindered
and
destroyed
every
sort
of
cultivation
his
letters
on
monasticism
caused
great
attention
they
were
received
with
great
applause
by
all
protestants
and
many
catholics
if
herr
von
laroche
opposed
everything
that
can
be
called
sensibility
and
even
decidedly
avoided
the
very
appearance
of
it
he
nevertheless
did
not
conceal
a
tender
paternal
affection
for
his
eldest
daughter
who
indeed
was
nothing
else
but
amiable
she
was
rather
short
than
tall
of
stature
and
delicately
built
her
figure
was
free
and
graceful
her
eyes
very
black
while
nothing
could
be
conceived
purer
and
more
blooming
than
her
complexion
she
also
loved
her
father
and
inclined
to
his
sentiments
being
an
active
man
of
business
most
of
his
time
was
consumed
in
works
belonging
to
his
calling
and
as
the
guests
who
stopped
at
his
house
were
really
attracted
by
his
wife
and
not
by
him
society
afforded
him
but
little
pleasure
at
table
he
was
cheerful
and
entertaining
and
at
least
endeavoured
to
keep
his
board
free
from
the
spice
of
sensibility
whoever
knows
the
views
and
mode
of
thought
of
frau
von
laroche
and
by
a
long
life
and
many
writings
she
has
become
honourably
known
to
every
german
may
perhaps
suspect
that
a
domestic
incongruity
must
have
arisen
here
nothing
of
the
kind
she
was
the
most
wonderful
woman
and
i
know
no
other
to
compare
to
her
slenderly
and
delicately
built
rather
tall
than
short
she
had
even
to
her
more
advanced
years
managed
to
preserve
a
certain
elegance
both
of
form
and
of
conduct
which
pleasantly
fluctuated
between
the
conduct
of
a
noble
lady
and
that
of
one
of
the
citizen
class
her
dress
had
been
the
same
for
several
years
a
neat
little
cap
with
wings
very
well
became
her
small
head
and
delicate
face
and
her
brown
or
grey
clothing
gave
repose
and
dignity
to
her
presence
she
spoke
well
and
always
knew
how
to
give
importance
to
what
she
said
by
an
expression
of
feeling
her
conduct
was
perfectly
the
same
towards
every
body
but
with
all
this
the
greatest
peculiarity
of
her
character
is
not
yet
expressed
it
is
difficult
to
designate
it
she
seemed
to
take
interest
in
everything
but
really
nothing
acted
upon
her
she
was
gentle
towards
every
one
and
could
endure
everything
without
suffering
the
jests
of
her
husband
the
tenderness
of
her
friends
the
sweetness
of
her
children
to
all
this
she
replied
in
the
same
manner
and
thus
she
always
remained
herself
without
being
affected
in
the
world
by
good
and
evil
or
in
literature
by
excellence
and
weakness
to
this
disposition
she
owes
that
independence
which
she
maintains
even
to
an
advanced
age
through
many
sad
nay
sorrowful
events
but
not
to
be
unjust
i
must
state
that
her
sons
then
children
of
dazzling
beauty
often
elicited
from
her
an
expression
different
from
that
which
served
her
for
daily
use
merk
influence
thus
i
lived
for
a
time
in
a
wonderfully
pleasant
society
until
merck
came
with
his
family
here
arose
at
once
new
affinities
for
while
the
two
ladies
approached
each
other
merck
had
come
into
closer
contact
with
herr
von
laroche
as
a
connoisseur
of
the
world
and
of
business
as
a
and
travelled
man
the
boy
associated
himself
with
the
boys
and
the
daughters
of
whom
the
eldest
soon
particularly
attracted
me
fell
to
my
share
it
is
a
very
pleasant
sensation
when
a
new
passion
begins
to
stir
in
us
before
the
old
one
is
quite
extinct
thus
when
the
sun
is
setting
one
often
likes
to
see
the
moon
rise
on
the
opposite
side
and
one
takes
delight
in
the
double
lustre
of
the
two
heavenly
luminaries
there
was
now
no
lack
of
rich
entertainment
either
in
or
out
of
the
house
we
wandered
about
the
spot
and
ascended
ehrenbreitstein
on
this
side
of
the
river
and
the
on
the
other
the
city
the
the
ferry
which
took
us
over
the
rhine
all
gave
us
the
most
varied
delight
the
new
castle
was
not
yet
built
we
were
taken
to
the
place
where
it
was
to
stand
and
allowed
to
see
the
preparatory
sketches
nevertheless
amid
those
cheerful
circumstances
was
internally
developed
that
element
of
unsociableness
which
both
in
cultivated
and
uncultivated
circles
ordinarily
shows
its
malign
effects
merck
at
once
cold
and
restless
had
not
long
listened
to
that
correspondence
before
he
uttered
aloud
many
waggish
notions
concerning
the
things
which
were
the
subjects
of
discourse
as
well
as
the
persons
and
their
circumstances
while
he
revealed
to
me
in
secret
the
oddest
things
which
really
were
concealed
under
them
political
secrets
were
never
touched
on
nor
indeed
anything
that
could
have
had
a
definite
connexion
he
only
made
me
attentive
to
persons
who
without
remarkable
talents
contrive
by
a
certain
tact
to
obtain
personal
influence
and
by
an
acquaintance
with
many
try
to
make
something
out
of
themselves
and
from
this
time
forwards
i
had
opportunity
to
observe
several
men
of
the
sort
since
such
persons
usually
change
their
place
and
as
travellers
come
now
here
now
there
they
have
the
advantage
of
novelty
which
should
neither
be
envied
nor
spoiled
for
this
is
a
mere
customary
matter
which
every
traveller
has
often
experienced
to
his
benefit
and
every
resident
to
his
detriment
be
that
as
it
may
it
is
enough
that
from
that
time
forward
we
cherished
an
uneasy
nay
envious
attention
to
people
of
the
sort
who
went
about
on
their
own
account
cast
anchor
in
every
city
and
sought
to
gain
an
influence
at
least
in
some
families
i
have
represented
a
tender
and
soft
specimen
of
these
in
pater
brey
another
of
more
aptness
and
bluntness
in
a
carnival
play
to
be
hereafter
published
which
bears
the
title
or
the
deified
this
i
have
done
if
not
with
fairness
at
least
with
good
humour
however
the
strange
elements
of
our
little
society
still
worked
quite
tolerably
one
upon
another
we
were
partly
united
by
our
own
manner
and
style
of
breeding
and
partly
restrained
by
the
peculiar
conduct
of
our
hostess
who
being
but
lightly
touched
by
that
which
passed
around
her
always
resigned
herself
to
certain
ideal
notions
and
while
she
understood
how
to
utter
them
in
a
friendly
and
benevolent
way
contrived
to
soften
everything
sharp
that
might
arise
in
the
company
and
to
smooth
down
all
that
was
uneven
merck
had
sounded
a
retreat
just
at
the
right
time
so
that
the
party
separated
on
the
best
of
terms
i
went
with
him
and
his
in
a
yacht
which
was
returning
up
the
rhine
towards
mayence
and
although
this
vessel
went
very
slowly
of
itself
we
nevertheless
besought
the
captain
not
to
hurry
himself
thus
we
enjoyed
at
leisure
the
infinitely
various
objects
which
in
the
most
splendid
weather
seem
to
increase
in
beauty
every
hour
and
both
in
greatness
and
agreeableness
ever
to
change
anew
and
i
only
wish
that
while
i
utter
the
names
rheinfels
and
goar
bacharach
bingen
ellfeld
and
biberich
every
one
of
my
readers
may
be
able
to
recall
these
spots
to
memory
we
had
sketched
industriously
and
had
thus
at
least
gained
a
deeper
impression
of
the
thousandfold
changes
of
those
splendid
shores
at
the
same
time
by
being
so
much
longer
together
by
a
familiar
communication
on
so
many
sorts
of
things
our
connexion
became
so
much
the
more
intimate
that
merck
gained
a
great
influence
over
me
and
i
as
a
good
companion
became
indispensable
to
him
for
a
comfortable
existence
my
eye
sharpened
by
nature
again
turned
to
the
contemplation
of
art
for
which
the
beautiful
frankfort
collections
afforded
me
the
best
opportunity
both
in
paintings
and
engravings
and
i
have
been
much
indebted
to
the
kindness
of
mm
ettling
and
ehrenreich
but
especially
to
the
excellent
nothnagel
to
see
nature
in
art
became
with
me
a
passion
which
in
its
highest
moments
must
have
appeared
to
others
passionate
amateurs
as
they
might
be
almost
like
madness
and
how
could
such
an
inclination
be
better
fostered
than
by
a
constant
observation
of
the
excellent
works
of
the
netherlanders
that
i
might
make
myself
practically
acquainted
with
these
things
nothnagel
gave
me
a
little
room
where
i
found
every
thing
that
was
requisite
for
oil
painting
and
painted
after
nature
some
simple
subjects
of
still
life
one
of
which
a
inlaid
with
silver
so
astonished
my
master
who
had
last
visited
me
an
hour
before
that
he
maintained
one
of
his
subordinate
artists
must
have
been
with
me
during
the
time
reviving
taste
for
art
had
i
patiently
gone
on
practising
myself
on
such
objects
catching
their
light
and
the
peculiarities
of
their
surface
i
might
have
formed
a
sort
of
practical
skill
and
made
a
way
for
something
higher
i
was
however
prevented
by
the
fault
of
all
dilettantes
that
of
beginning
with
what
is
most
difficult
and
ever
wishing
to
perform
the
impossible
and
i
soon
involved
myself
in
greater
undertakings
in
which
i
stuck
fast
both
because
they
were
beyond
my
technical
capabilities
and
because
i
could
not
always
maintain
pure
and
operative
that
loving
attention
and
patient
industry
by
which
even
the
beginner
accomplishes
something
at
the
same
time
i
was
once
more
carried
into
a
higher
sphere
by
finding
an
opportunity
of
purchasing
some
fine
plaster
casts
of
antique
heads
the
italians
who
visit
the
fairs
often
brought
with
them
good
specimens
of
the
kind
and
sold
them
cheap
after
they
had
taken
moulds
of
them
in
this
manner
i
set
up
for
myself
a
little
museum
as
i
gradually
brought
together
the
heads
of
the
laocoön
his
sons
and
niobe
daughters
i
also
bought
miniature
copies
of
the
most
important
works
of
antiquity
from
the
estate
of
a
deceased
friend
of
art
and
thus
sought
once
more
to
revive
as
much
as
possible
the
great
impression
which
i
had
received
at
mannheim
while
i
now
sought
to
cultivate
foster
and
maintain
all
the
talent
taste
or
other
inclination
that
might
live
in
me
i
applied
a
good
part
of
the
day
according
to
my
father
wish
in
the
duties
of
an
advocate
for
the
practice
of
which
i
chanced
to
find
the
best
opportunity
after
the
death
of
my
grandfather
my
uncle
textor
had
come
into
the
council
and
consigned
to
me
the
little
offices
to
which
i
was
equal
while
the
brothers
schlosser
did
the
same
i
made
myself
acquainted
with
the
documents
my
father
also
read
them
with
much
pleasure
as
by
means
of
his
son
he
again
saw
himself
in
an
activity
of
which
he
had
been
long
deprived
we
talked
the
matters
over
and
with
great
facility
i
then
made
the
necessary
statements
we
had
at
hand
an
excellent
copyist
on
whom
one
could
rely
for
all
legal
formalities
and
this
occupation
was
the
more
agreeable
to
me
as
it
brought
me
closer
to
my
father
who
being
perfectly
satisfied
with
my
conduct
in
this
respect
readily
looked
with
an
eye
of
indulgence
on
all
my
other
pursuits
in
the
ardent
expectation
that
i
should
now
soon
gather
in
a
harvest
of
fame
as
an
author
because
now
in
every
epoch
all
things
are
connected
together
since
the
ruling
views
and
opinions
are
ramified
in
the
most
various
manner
so
in
the
science
of
law
those
maxims
were
gradually
pursued
according
to
which
religion
and
morals
were
treated
among
the
attorneys
as
the
younger
people
and
then
among
the
judges
as
the
elder
a
spirit
of
humanity
was
diffused
and
all
vied
with
each
other
in
being
as
humane
as
possible
even
in
legal
affairs
prisons
were
improved
crimes
excused
punishments
lightened
legitimations
rendered
easy
separations
and
unequal
marriages
encouraged
and
one
of
our
eminent
lawyers
gained
for
himself
the
highest
fame
when
he
contrived
by
hard
fighting
to
gain
for
the
son
of
an
executioner
an
entrance
into
the
college
of
surgeons
in
vain
did
guilds
and
corporations
oppose
one
dam
after
another
was
broken
through
the
toleration
of
the
religious
parties
towards
each
other
was
not
merely
taught
but
practised
and
the
civil
constitution
was
threatened
with
a
still
greater
influence
when
the
effort
was
made
to
recommend
to
that
age
with
understanding
acuteness
and
power
toleration
toward
the
jews
those
new
subjects
for
legal
treatment
which
lay
without
the
law
and
tradition
and
only
laid
claim
to
a
fair
examination
to
a
kindly
sympathy
required
at
the
same
time
a
more
natural
and
animated
style
here
for
us
the
youngest
was
opened
a
cheerful
field
in
which
we
bustled
about
with
delight
and
i
still
recollect
that
an
imperial
councillor
agent
in
a
case
of
the
sort
sent
me
a
very
polite
letter
of
commendation
the
french
served
us
for
patterns
and
for
stimulants
we
were
thus
on
the
way
to
become
better
orators
than
jurists
a
fact
to
which
george
schlosser
once
called
my
attention
blaming
me
while
doing
so
i
told
him
that
i
had
read
to
my
clients
a
controversial
paper
written
with
much
energy
in
their
favour
at
which
they
had
shown
the
greatest
satisfaction
upon
this
he
replied
to
me
in
this
case
you
have
shown
yourself
more
an
author
than
an
advocate
we
must
never
ask
how
such
a
writing
may
please
the
client
but
how
it
may
please
the
judge
state
of
the
german
stage
as
the
occupations
to
which
one
devotes
one
day
are
never
so
serious
and
pressing
that
one
can
not
find
time
enough
in
the
evening
to
go
to
the
play
thus
was
it
also
with
me
who
in
the
want
of
a
really
good
stage
did
not
cease
thinking
of
the
german
theatre
in
order
to
discover
how
one
might
cooperate
upon
it
with
any
degree
of
activity
its
condition
in
the
second
half
of
the
last
century
is
sufficiently
known
and
every
one
who
wishes
to
be
instructed
about
it
finds
assistance
at
hand
everywhere
on
this
account
i
only
intend
to
insert
here
a
few
general
remarks
the
success
of
the
stage
rested
more
upon
the
personality
of
the
actors
than
upon
the
value
of
the
pieces
this
was
especially
the
case
with
pieces
half
or
wholly
extemporized
when
everything
depended
on
the
humour
and
talent
of
the
comic
actors
the
matter
of
such
pieces
must
be
taken
out
of
the
commonest
life
in
conformity
with
the
people
before
whom
they
are
acted
from
this
immediate
application
arises
the
greatest
applause
which
these
plays
have
always
gained
they
were
always
at
home
in
south
germany
where
they
are
retained
to
the
present
day
and
the
change
of
persons
alone
renders
it
necessary
to
give
from
time
to
time
some
change
to
the
character
of
the
comic
masks
however
the
german
theatre
in
conformity
with
the
serious
character
of
the
nation
soon
took
a
turn
towards
the
moral
which
was
still
more
accelerated
by
an
external
cause
for
the
question
arose
among
strict
christians
whether
the
theatre
belonged
to
those
sinful
things
which
are
to
be
shunned
at
all
events
or
to
those
indifferent
things
which
can
be
good
to
the
good
and
bad
to
the
bad
some
zealots
denied
the
latter
and
held
fast
the
opinion
that
no
clergyman
should
ever
enter
the
theatre
now
the
opposite
opinion
could
not
be
maintained
with
energy
unless
the
theatre
was
declared
to
be
not
only
harmless
but
even
useful
to
be
useful
it
must
be
moral
and
in
this
direction
it
developed
itself
in
north
germany
the
more
as
by
a
sort
of
the
comic
character
was
banished
and
although
intelligent
persons
took
his
part
was
forced
to
retire
having
already
gone
from
the
coarseness
of
the
german
into
the
neatness
and
delicacy
of
the
italian
and
french
harlequins
even
scapin
and
crispin
gradually
vanished
the
latter

saw
played
for
the
last
time
by
koch

his
old
age

already
made
the
attentive

more
delicate
morality

severe
and

consequences
of

analysed
in
a
frightful
manner
in
lessing
sara
treated
the
same
theme
whilst
the
of
exhibited
a
misguided
youth
in
the
most
terrible
situation
the
french
dramas
had
the
same
end
but
proceeded
more
moderately
and
contrived
to
please
by
some
accommodation
at
the
end
diderot

knowing

and
other
works
of
the
sort

that
honest
feeling
of
citizen
and

which
began
more
and
more
to
prevail
with
us
the
the
from
parental
and
all
of
their
kin
went
the
same
way
the

other
pieces
by
gehler

father
of

by
gemming

brought
agreeably
to
view
the
worth
of
the
middle
and
even
of
the
lower
class
and
delighted
the
great
public
eckhof
by
his
noble
personality
which
gave
to
the
actor
profession
a
dignity
in
which
it
had
hitherto
been
deficient
elevated
to
an
uncommon
degree
the
leading
characters
in
such
pieces
since
as
an
honest
man
the
expression
of
honesty
succeeded
with
him
to
perfection
while
now
the
german
theatre
was
completely
inclining
to
effeminacy
schröder
arose
as
an
author
and
actor
and
prompted
by
the
connexion
between
hamburg
and
england
adapted
some
english
comedies
the
material
of
these
he
could
only
use
in
the
most
general
way
since
the
originals
are
for
the
most
part
formless
and
if
they
begin
well
and
according
to
a
certain
plan
they
wander
from
the
mark
at
last
the
sole
concern
of
their
authors
seems
to
be
the
introduction
of
the
oddest
scenes
and
whoever
is
accustomed
to
a
sustained
work
of
art
at
last
unwillingly
finds
himself
driven
into
the
boundless
besides
this
a
wild
immoral
vulgarly
dissolute
tone
so
decidedly
pervades
the
whole
to
an
intolerable
degree
that
it
must
have
been
difficult
to
deprive
the
plan
and
the
characters
of
all
their
bad
manners
they
are
a
coarse
and
at
the
same
time
dangerous
food
which
can
only
be
enjoyed
and
digested
by
a
large
and
populace
at
a
certain
time
schröder
did
more
for
these
things
than
is
usually
known
he
thoroughly
altered
them
assimilated
them
to
the
german
mind
and
softened
them
as
much
as
possible
but
still
a
bitter
kernel
always
remains
in
them
because
the
joke
often
depends
on
the
of
persons
whether
they
deserve
it
or
not
in
these
performances
which
were
also
widely
spread
upon
our
stage
lay
a
secret
counterpoise
to
that
too
delicate
morality
and
the
action
of
both
kinds
of
drama
against
each
other
fortunately
prevented
the
monotony
into
which
people
would
otherwise
have
fallen
schroeder
adaptation

the

to

no
one
but
as
no
man
however
well
he
thinks
is
secure
that
something
may
not
be
put
upon
him
against
his
inclination
and
as
moreover
comedy
in
general
if
it
is
to
please
always
presupposes
or
awakens
something
of
malice
in
the
spectator
so
by
a
natural
path
did
people
come
to
a
conduct
which
hitherto
had
been
deemed
unnatural
this
consisted
in
lowering
the
higher
classes
and
more
or
less
attacking
them
satire
whether
in
prose
or
verse
had
always
avoided

from

direction
and
remained
in
a
lower
circle
zachariä
occupies
himself
much
with
country
noblemen
comically
sets
forth
their
tastes
and
peculiarities
but
this
is
done
without
contempt
thümmel
an
ingenious
little
composition
as
pleasant
as
it
is
bold
gained
great
applause
perhaps
because
the
author
himself
a
nobleman
and
courtier
treated
his
own
class
unsparingly
but
the
boldest
step
was
taken
by
lessing
in
his
where
the
passions
and
intrigues
of
the
higher
classes
are
delineated
in
a
bitter
and
cutting
manner
all
these
things
perfectly
corresponded
to
the
excited
spirit
of
the
time
and
men
of
less
mind
and
talent
thought
they
might
do
the
same
or
even
more
as
indeed

reinhardt
was
the
at
this
unpleasant
board
to
the
comfort
and
edification
of
all
the
guests
from
this
time
forward
the
theatrical
villains
were
always
chosen
from
the
higher
ranks
and
a
person
must
be
a
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
or
at
least
a
private
secretary
to
be
worthy
of
such
a
distinction
but
for
the
most
godless
examples
the
highest
offices
and
places
in
the
court
and
civil
list
were
chosen
in
which
high
society
even
the
justiciaries
found
their
place
as
villains
of
the
first
water
but
as
i
must
fear
already
that
i
have
been
carried
beyond
the
time
which
is
now
the
subject
in
hand
i
return
back
to
myself
to
mention
the
impulse
which
i
felt
to
occupy
myself
in
my
leisure
hours
with
the
theatrical
plans
which
i
had
once
devised
by
my
lasting
interest
in
shakspeare
works
i
had
so
expanded
my
mind
that
the
narrow
compass
of
the
stage
and
the
short
time
allotted
to
a
representation
seemed
to
me
by
no
means
sufficient
to
bring
forward
something
important
the
life
of
the
gallant
götz
von
berlichingen
written
by
himself
impelled
me
into
the
historic
mode
of
treatment
and
my
imagination
so
much
extended
itself
that
my
dramatic
form
also
went
beyond
all
theatrical
bounds
and
sought
more
and
more
to
approach
the
living
events
i
had
as
i
proceeded
talked
circumstantially
on
this
subject
with
my
sister
who
was
interested
heart
and
soul
in
such
things
and
renewed
this
conversation
so
often
without
going
to
any
work
that
she
at
last
growing
impatient
and
at
the
same
time
wishing
me
well
urgently
entreated
me
not
to
be
always
casting
my
words
into
the
air
but
once
for
all
to
set
down
upon
paper
that
which
must
have
been
so
present
to
my
mind
determined
by
this
impulse
i
began
one
morning
to
write
without
having
made
any
previous
sketch
or
plan
i
wrote
the
first
scenes
and
in
the
evening
they
were
read
aloud
to
cornelia
she
gave
them
much
applause
but
only
conditionally
since
she
doubted
that
i
should
go
on
so
nay
she
even
expressed
a
decided
unbelief
in
my
perseverance
this
only
incited
me
the
more
i
wrote
on
the
next
day
and
also
the
third
hope
increased
with
the
daily
communications
and
from
step
to
step
everything
gained
more
life
while
the
matter
moreover
had
become
thoroughly
my
own
thus
i
kept
without
interruption
to
my
work
which
i
pursued
straight
on
looking
neither
backwards
nor
forwards
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
and
in
about
six
weeks
i
had
the
pleasure
to
see
the
manuscript
stitched
i
communicated
it
to
merck
who
spoke
sensibly
and
kindly
about
it
i
sent
it
to
herder
who
on
the
contrary
expressed
himself
unkindly
and
severely
and
did
not
fail
in
some
lampoons
written
for
the
occasion
to
give
me
nicknames
on
account
of
it
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
be
perplexed
by
this
but
took
a
clear
view
of
my
object
the
die
was
now
cast
and
the
only
question
was
how
to
play
the
game
best
i
plainly
saw
that
even
here
no
one
would
advise
me
and
as
after
some
time
i
could
regard
my
work
as
if
it
had
proceeded
from
another
hand
i
indeed
perceived
that
in
my
attempt
to
renounce
unity
of
time
and
place
i
had
also
infringed
upon
that
higher
unity
which
is
so
much
the
more
required
since
without
plan
or
sketch
i
had
merely
abandoned
myself
to
my
imagination
and
to
an
internal
impulse
i
had
not
deviated
much
at
the
beginning
and
the
first
acts
could
fairly
pass
for
what
they
were
intended
to
be
in
the
following
acts
however
and
especially
towards
the
end
i
was
unconsciously
carried
along
by
a
wonderful
passion
while
trying
to
describe
adelheid
as
amiable
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
myself
my
pen
was
involuntarily
devoted
to
her
alone
the
interest
in
her
fate
gained
the
preponderance
and
as
apart
from
this
consideration
götz
towards
the
end
is
without
activity
and
afterwards
only
returns
to
an
unlucky
participation
in
the
nothing
was
more
natural
than
that
a
charming
woman
should
supplant
him
in
the
mind
of
the
author
who
casting
off
the
fetters
of
art
thought
to
try
himself
in
a
new
field
this
defect
or
rather
this
culpable
superfluity
i
soon
perceived
since
the
nature
of
my
poetry
always
impelled
me
to
unity
i
now
instead
of
the
biography
of
götz
and
german
antiquities
kept
my
own
work
in
mind
and
sought
to
give
it
more
and
more
historical
and
national
substance
and
to
cancel
that
which
was
fabulous
or
merely
proceeded
from
passion
in
this
i
indeed
sacrificed
much
as
the
inclination
of
the
man
had
to
yield
to
the
conviction
of
the
artist
thus
for
instance
i
had
pleased
myself
highly
by
malting
adelheid
enter
into
a
terrific
nocturnal
and
perform
wonders
by
her
beautiful
presence
a
nearer
examination
banished
her
and
the
between
franz
and
his
noble
gracious
lady
which
was
very
circumstantially
carried
on
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
acts
was
much
condensed
and
could
only
be
suffered
to
appear
in
its
chief
points
goetz
von
berlichingen
therefore
without
altering
anything
in
the
first
manuscript
which
i
still
actually
possess
in
its
original
shape
i
determined
to
rewrite
the
whole
and
did
this
with
such
activity
that
in
a
few
weeks
an
entirely
piece
lay
before
me
i
went
to
work
upon
this
all
the
quicker
the
less
my
intention
was
ever
to
have
the
second
poem
printed
as
i
looked
upon
this
likewise
as
a
mere
preparatory
exercise
which
in
future
i
should
again
lay
at
the
foundation
of
a
new
treatment
to
be
accomplished
with
greater
industry
and
deliberation
when
i
began
to
lay
before
merck
many
proposals
as
to
the
way
in
which
i
should
set
about
this
task
he
laughed
at
me
and
asked
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
perpetual
writing
and
rewriting
the
thing
he
said
by
this
means
becomes
only
different
and
seldom
better
one
must
see
what
effect
one
thing
produces
and
then
again
try
something
new
be
in
time
at
the
hedge
if
you
would
dry
your
linen
he
exclaimed
in
the
words
of
the
proverb
hesitation
and
delay
only
make
uncertain
men
on
the
other
hand
i
replied
to
him
that
it
would
be
unpleasant
to
me
to
offer
to
a
bookseller
a
work
on
which
i
had
bestowed
so
much
affection
and
perhaps
to
receive
a
refusal
as
an
answer
for
how
would
they
judge
of
a
young
nameless
and
also
audacious
author
as
my
dread
of
the
press
gradually
vanished
i
had
wished
to
see
printed
my
comedy
upon
which
i
set
some
value
but
i
found
no
publisher
inclined
in
my
favour
here
the
technically
mercantile
taste
of
my
friend
was
at
once
excited
by
means
of
the
gazette
he
had
already
formed
a
connexion
with
learned
men
and
booksellers
and
therefore
he
thought
that
we
ought
to
publish
at
our
own
expense
this
singular
and
certainly
striking
work
and
that
we
should
derive
a
larger
profit
from
it
like
many
others
he
used
often
to
reckon
up
for
the
booksellers
their
profit
which
with
many
works
was
certainly
great
especially
if
one
left
out
of
the
account
how
much
was
lost
by
other
writings
and
commercial
affairs
enough
it
was
settled
that
i
should
procure
the
paper
and
that
he
should
take
care
of
the
printing
thus
we
went
heartily
to
work
and
i
was
not
displeased
gradually
to
see
my
wild
dramatic
sketch
in
clean
it
looked
really
neater
than
i
myself
expected
we
completed
the
work
and
it
was
sent
off
in
many
parcels
before
long
a
great
commotion
arose
everywhere
the
attention
which
it
created
became
universal
but
because
with
our
limited
means
the
copies
could
not
be
sent
quick
enough
to
all
parts
a
pirated
edition
suddenly
made
its
appearance
as
moreover
there
could
be
no
immediate
return
especially
in
ready
money
for
the
copies
sent
out
so
was
i
as
a
young
man
in
a
family
whose
treasury
could
not
be
in
an
abundant
condition
at
the
very
time
when
much
attention
nay
much
applause
was
bestowed
upon
me
extremely
perplexed
as
to
how
i
should
pay
for
the
paper
by
means
of
which
i
had
made
the
world
acquainted
with
my
talent
on
the
other
hand
merck
who
knew
better
how
to
help
himself
entertained
the
best
hopes
that
all
would
soon
come
right
again
but
i
never
perceived
that
to
be
the
case
goetz
von
berlichingen
through
the
little
pamphlets
which
i
had
published
anonymously
i
had
at
my
own
expense
learned
to
know
the
critics
and
the
public
and
i
was
thus
pretty
well
prepared
for
praise
and
blame
especially
as
for
many
years
i
had
constantly
folio
wed
up
the
subject
and
had
observed
how
those
authors
were
treated
to
whom
i
had
devoted
particular
attention
here
even
in
my
uncertainty
i
could
plainly
remark
how
much
that
was
groundless
and
arbitrary
was
recklessly
uttered
now
the
same
thing
befel
me
and
if
i
had
not
had
some
basis
of
my
own
how
much
would
the
contradictions
of
cultivated
men
have
perplexed
me
thus
for
instance
there
was
in
the
a
diffuse
criticism
composed
by
some
man
of
limited
mind
where
he
found
fault
i
could
not
agree
with
him
still
less
when
he
stated
how
the
affair
could
have
been
done
otherwise
it
was
therefore
highly
gratifying
to
me
when
immediately
afterwards
i
found
a
pleasant
explanation
by
wieland
who
in
general
opposed
the
critic
and
took
my
part
against
him
however
the
former
review
was
printed
likewise
i
saw
an
example
of
the
dull
state
of
mind
among
and
cultivated
men
how
then
would
it
look
with
the
great
public
the
pleasure
of
talking
over
such
things
with
merck
and
thus
gaining
light
upon
them
was
of
short
duration
for
the
intelligent
landgravine
of
took
him
with
her
train
on
her
journey
to
petersburg
the
detailed
letters
which
he
wrote
to
me
gave
me
a
farther
insight
into
the
world
which
i
could
the
more
make
my
own
as
the
descriptions
were
made
by
a
and
friendly
hand
but
nevertheless
i
remained
very
solitary
for
a
long
time
and
was
deprived
just
at
this
important
epoch
of
his
enlightening
sympathy
of
which
i
then
stood
in
so
much
need
just
as
one
embraces
the
determination
to
become
a
soldier
and
go
to
the
wars
and
courageously
resolves
to
bear
danger
and
difficulties
as
well
as
to
endure
wounds
and
pains
and
even
death
but
at
the
same
time
never
calls
to
mind
the
particular
cases
in
which
those
generally
anticipated
evils
may
surprise
us
in
an
extremely
unpleasant
manner
so
it
is
with
every
one
who
ventures
into
the
world
especially
an
author
and
so
it
was
with
me
as
the
great
part
of
mankind
is
more
excited
by
a
subject
than
by
the
treatment
of
it
so
it
was
to
the
subject
that
the
sympathy
of
young
men
for
my
pieces
was
generally
owing
they
thought
they
could
see
in
them
a
banner
under
the
guidance
of
which
all
that
is
wild
and
unpolished
in
youth
might
find
a
vent
and
those
of
the
very
best
brains
who
had
previously
harboured
a
similar
crotchet
were
thus
carried
away
i
still
possess
a
letter
i
know
not
to
whom
from
the
excellent
and
in
many
respects
unique
bürger
which
may
serve
as
an
important
voucher
of
the
effect
and
excitement
which
was
then
produced
by
that
phenomenon
on
the
other
side
some
men
blamed
me
for
painting
the
in
too
favourable
colours
and
even
attributed
to
me
the
intention
of
bringing
those
disorderly
times
back
again
others
took
me
for
a
profoundly
learned
man
and
wished
me
to
publish
a
new
edition
with
notes
of
the
original
narrative
of
the
good
götz
a
task
to
which
i
felt
by
no
means
adapted
although
i
allowed
my
name
to
be
put
on
the
title
to
the
new
impression
because
i
had
understood
how
to
gather
the
flowers
of
a
great
existence
they
took
me
for
a
careful
gardener
however
this
learning
and
profound
knowledge
of
mine
were
much
doubted
by
others
a
respectable
man
of
business
quite
unexpectedly
pays
me
a
visit
i
find
myself
highly
honoured
by
this
especially
as
he
opens
his
discourse
with
the
praise
of
my
von
and
my
good
insight
into
german
history
but
i
am
nevertheless
astonished
when
i
remark
that
he
has
really
come
for
the
sole
purpose
of
informing
me
that
götz
von
berlichingen
was
no
to
franz
von
sichingen
and
that
therefore
by
this
poetical
matrimonial
alliance
i
have
committed
a
great
historical
error
i
sought
to
excuse
myself
by
the
fact
that
götz
himself
calls
him
so
but
was
met
by
the
reply
that
this
is
a
form
of
expression
which
only
denotes
a
nearer
and
more
friendly
connexion
just
as
in
modern
times
we
call
postilions
without
being
bound
to
them
by
any
family
tie
i
thanked
him
as
well
as
i
could
for
this
information
and
only
regretted
that
the
evil
was
now
not
to
be
remedied
this
was
regretted
by
him
also
while
he
exhorted
me
in
the
kindest
manner
to
a
further
study
of
the
german
history
and
constitution
and
offered
me
his
library
of
which
i
afterwards
made
a
good
use
goetz
von
berlichingen
a
droll
event
of
the
sort
which
occurred
to
me
was
the
visit
of
a
bookseller
who
with
cheerful
openness
requested
a
dozen
of
such
pieces
and
promised
to
pay
well
for
them
that
we
made
ourselves
very
merry
about
this
may
be
imagined
and
yet
in
fact
he
was
not
so
very
far
wrong
for
i
was
already
greatly
occupied
in
moving
backwards
and
forwards
from
this
in
german
history
and
in
working
up
the
chief
events
in
a
similar
spirit
a
laudable
design
which
like
many
others
was
frustrated
by
the
rushing
flight
of
time
that
play
however
had
not
solely
occupied
the
author
but
while
it
was
devised
written
rewritten
printed
and
circulated
other
images
and
plans
were
moving
in
his
mind
those
which
could
be
treated
dramatically
had
the
advantage
of
being
oftenest
thought
over
and
brought
near
to
execution
but
at
the
same
time
was
developed
a
transition
to
another
form
which
is
not
usually
classed
with
those
of
the
drama
but
yet
has
a
great
affinity
with
them
this
transition
was
chiefly
brought
about
by
a
peculiarity
of
the
author
which
fashioned
soliloquy
into
dialogue
accustomed
to
pass
his
time
most
pleasantly
in
society
he
changed
even
solitary
thought
into
social
converse
and
this
in
the
following
manner
he
had
the
habit
when
he
was
alone
of
calling
before
his
mind
any
person
of
his
acquaintance
this
person
he
entreated
to
sit
down
walked
up
and
down
by
him
remained
standing
before
him
and
discoursed
with
him
on
the
subject
he
had
in
his
mind
to
this
the
person
answered
as
occasion
required
or
by
the
ordinary
gestures
signified
his
assent
or
dissent
in
which
every
man
has
something
peculiar
to
himself
the
speaker
then
continued
to
carry
out
further
that
which
seemed
to
please
the
guest
or
to
condition
and
define
more
closely
that
of
which
he
disapproved
and
finally
was
polite
enough
to
give
up
his
notion
the
oddest
part
of
the
affair
was
that
he
never
selected
persons
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
but
those
whom
he
saw
but
seldom
nay
several
who
lived
at
a
distance
in
the
world
and
with
whom
he
had
had
a
transient
connexion
they
were
however
chiefly
persons
who
more
of
a
receptive
than
communicative
nature
are
ready
with
a
pure
feeling
to
take
interest
in
the
things
which
fall
within
their
sphere
though
he
often
summoned
contradicting
spirits
to
these
dialectic
exercises
persons
of
both
sexes
of
every
age
and
rank
accommodated
themselves
to
these
discussions
and
showed
themselves
obliging
and
agreeable
since
he
only
conversed
on
subjects
which
were
clear
to
them
and
which
they
liked
nevertheless
it
would
have
appeared
extremely
strange
to
many
of
them
could
they
have
learned
how
often
they
were
summoned
to
these
ideal
conversations
since
many
of
them
would
scarcely
have
come
to
a
real
one
how
nearly
such
a
mental
dialogue
is
akin
to
a
written
correspondence
is
clear
enough
only
in
the
latter
one
sees
returned
the
confidence
one
has
bestowed
while
in
the
former
one
creates
for
oneself
a
confidence
which
is
new
and
unreturned
when
therefore
he
had
to
describe
that
disgust
which
men
without
being
driven
by
necessity
feel
for
life
the
author
necessarily
hit
at
once
upon
the
plan
of
giving
his
sentiments
in
letters
for
all
gloominess
is
a
birth
a
pupil
of
solitude
whoever
resigns
himself
to
it
flies
all
opposition
and
what
is
more
opposed
to
him
than
a
cheerful
society
the
enjoyment
in
life
felt
by
others
is
to
him
a
painful
reproach
and
thus
by
that
which
should
charm
him
out
of
himself
he
is
directed
back
to
his
inmost
soul
if
he
at
all
expresses
himself
on
this
matter
it
will
be
by
letters
for
no
one
feels
immediately
opposed
to
a
written
effusion
whether
it
be
joyful
or
gloomy
while
an
answer
containing
opposite
reasons
gives
the
lonely
one
an
opportunity
to
confirm
himself
in
his
whims
an
occasion
to
grow
still
more
obdurate
the
letters
of
werther
which
are
written
in
this
spirit
have
so
various
a
charm
precisely
because
their
different
contents
were
first
talked
over
with
several
individuals
in
such
ideal
dialogues
while
it
was
afterwards
in
the
composition
itself
that
they
appeared
to
be
directed
to
one
friend
and
sympathizer
to
say
more
on
the
treatment
of
a
little
book
which
has
formed
the
subject
of
so
much
discussion
would
be
hardly
advisable
but
with
respect
to
the
contents
something
may
yet
be
added
weariness
of
life
that
disgust
at
life
has
its
physical
and
its
moral
causes
the
former
we
will
leave
to
the
investigation
of
the
physician
the
latter
to
that
of
the
moralist
and
in
a
matter
so
often
elaborated
only
consider
the
chief
point
where
the
phenomenon
most
plainly
expresses
itself
all
comfort
in
life
is
based
upon
a
regular
recurrence
of
external
things
the
change
of
day
and
night
of
the
seasons
of
flowers
and
fruits
and
whatever
else
meets
us
from
epoch
to
epoch
so
that
we
can
and
should
enjoy
it
these
are
the
proper
springs
of
earthly
life
the
more
open
we
are
to
these
enjoyments
the
happier
do
we
feel
ourselves
out
if
the
changes
in
these
phenomena
roll
up
and
down
before
us
without
our
taking
interest
in
them
if
we
are
insensible
to
such
beautiful
offers
then
comes
on
the
greatest
evil
the
heaviest
disease
we
regard
life
as
a
disgusting
burden
it
is
said
of
an
englishman
that
he
hanged
himself
that
he
might
no
longer
dress
and
undress
himself
every
day
i
knew
a
worthy
gardener
the
superintendent
of
the
laying
out
of
a
large
park
who
once
cried
out
with
vexation
shall
i
always
see
these
clouds
moving
from
east
to
west
the
story
is
told
of
one
of
our
most
excellent
men
that
he
saw
with
vexation
the
returning
green
of
spring
and
wished
that
by
way
of
change
it
might
once
appear
red
these
are
properly
the
symptoms
of
a
weariness
of
life
which
does
not
unfrequently
result
in
suicide
and
which
in
thinking
men
absorbed
in
themselves
was
more
frequent
than
can
be
imagined
nothing
occasions
this
weariness
more
than
the
return
of
love
the
first
love
it
is
rightly
said
is
the
only
one
for
in
the
second
and
by
the
second
the
highest
sense
of
love
is
already
lost
the
conception
of
the
eternal
and
infinite
which
elevates
and
supports
it
is
destroyed
and
it
appears
transient
like
everything
else
that
recurs
the
separation
of
the
sensual
from
the
moral
which
in
the
complicated
cultivated
world
sunders
the
feelings
of
love
and
desire
produces
here
also
an
exaggeration
which
can
lead
to
no
good
moreover
a
young
man
soon
perceives
in
others
if
not
in
himself
that
moral
epochs
change
as
well
as
the
seasons
of
the
year
the
graciousness
of
the
great
the
favour
of
the
strong
the
encouragement
of
the
active
the
attachment
of
the
multitude
the
love
of
individuals
all
this
changes
up
and
down
and
we
can
no
more
hold
it
fast
than
the
sun
moon
and
stars
and
yet
these
things
are
not
mere
natural
events
they
escape
us
either
by
our
own
or
by
another
fault
but
change
they
do
and
we
are
never
sure
of
them
but
that
which
most
pains
a
sensitive
youth
is
the
unceasing
return
of
our
faults
for
how
late
do
we
learn
to
see
that
while
we
cultivate
our
virtues
we
rear
our
faults
at
the
same
time
the
former
depend
upon
the
latter
as
upon
their
root
and
the
latter
send
forth
secret
ramifications
as
strong
and
as
various
as
those
which
the
former
send
forth
in
open
light
because
now
we
generally
practise
our
virtues
with
will
and
consciousness
but
are
unconsciously
surprised
by
our
faults
the
former
seldom
procure
us
any
pleasure
while
the
latter
constantly
bring
trouble
and
pain
here
lies
the
most
difficult
point
in
that
which
makes
it
almost
impossible
if
we
conceive
in
addition
to
all
this
a
young
boiling
blood
an
imagination
easily
to
be
paralyzed
by
single
objects
and
moreover
the
uncertain
movements
of
the
day
we
shall
not
find
unnatural
an
impatient
striving
to
free
oneself
from
such
a
strait
however
such
gloomy
contemplations
which
lead
him
who
has
resigned
himself
to
them
into
the
infinite
could
not
have
developed
themselves
so
decidedly
in
the
minds
of
the
german
youths
had
not
an
outward
occasion
excited
and
furthered
them
in
this
dismal
business
this
was
caused
by
english
literature
especially
the
poetical
part
the
great
beauties
of
which
are
accompanied
by
an
earnest
melancholy
which
it
communicates
to
every
one
who
occupies
himself
with
it
the
intellectual
briton
from
his
youth
upwards
sees
himself
surrounded
by
a
significant
world
which
stimulates
all
his
powers
he
perceives
sooner
or
later
that
he
must
collect
all
his
understanding
to
come
to
terms
with
it
how
many
of
their
poets
have
in
their
youth
led
a
loose
and
riotous
life
and
soon
found
themselves
justified
in
complaining
of
the
vanity
of
earthly
things
how
many
of
them
have
tried
their
fortune
in
worldly
occupations
have
taken
parts
principal
or
subordinate
in
parliament
at
court
in
the
ministry
in
situations
with
the
embassy
shown
their
active
in
the
internal
troubles
and
changes
of
state
and
government
and
if
not
in
themselves
at
any
rate
in
their
friends
and
patrons
more
frequently
made
sad
than
pleasant
experiences
how
many
have
been
banished
imprisoned
or
injured
with
respect
to
property
effect
of
english
poetry
even
the
circumstance
of
being
the
spectator
of
such
great
events
calls
man
to
seriousness
and
whither
can
seriousness
lead
farther
than
to
a
contemplation
of
the
transient
nature
and
worthlessness
of
all
earthly
things
the
german
also
is
serious
and
thus
english
poetry
was
extremely
suitable
to
him
and
because
it
proceeded
from
a
higher
state
of
things
even
imposing
one
finds
in
it
throughout
a
great
apt
understanding
well
practised
in
the
world
a
deep
tender
heart
an
excellent
will
an
impassioned
action
the
very
noblest
qualities
which
can
be
praised
in
an
intellectual
and
cultivated
man
but
all
this
put
together
still
makes
no
poet
true
poetry
announces
itself
thus
that
as
a
worldly
gospel
it
can
by
internal
cheerfulness
and
external
comfort
free
us
from
the
earthly
burdens
which
press
upon
us
like
an
it
lifts
us
together
with
the
ballast
which
is
attached
to
us
into
higher
regions
and
lets
the
confused
labyrinths
of
the
earth
lie
developed
before
us
as
in
a
view
the
most
lively
as
well
as
the
most
serious
works
have
the
same
aim
of
moderating
both
pleasure
and
pain
by
a
felicitous
intellectual
form
let
us
only
in
this
spirit
consider
the
majority
of
the
english
poems
chiefly
morally
didactic
and
on
the
average
they
will
only
show
us
a
gloomy
weariness
of
life
not
only
young
where
this
theme
is
worked
out
but
even
the
other
contemplative
poems
stray
before
one
is
aware
of
it
into
this
dismal
region
where
the
understanding
is
presented
with
a
problem
which
it
can
not
solve
since
even
religion
much
as
it
can
always
construct
for
itself
leaves
it
in
the
lurch
whole
volumes
might
be
compiled
which
could
serve
as
a
commentary
to
this
frightful
text
then
old
age
and
experience
hand
in
hand
lead
him
to
death
and
make
him
understand
after
a
search
so
painful
and
so
long
that
all
his
life
he
has
been
in
the
wrong
what
further
makes
the
english
poets
accomplished
misanthropes
and
diffuses
over
their
writings
the
unpleasant
feeling
of
repugnance
against
everything
is
the
fact
that
the
whole
of
them
on
account
of
the
various
divisions
of
their
commonwealth
must
devote
themselves
for
the
best
part
if
not
for
the
whole
of
their
lives
to
one
party
or
another
because
now
a
writer
of
the
sort
can
not
praise
and
extol
those
of
the
party
to
which
he
belongs
nor
the
cause
to
which
he
adheres
since
if
he
did
he
would
only
excite
envy
and
hostility
he
exercises
his
talent
in
speaking
as
badly
as
possible
of
those
on
the
opposite
side
and
in
sharpening
nay
poisoning
the
satirical
weapons
as
much
as
he
can
when
this
is
done
by
both
parties
the
world
which
lies
between
is
destroyed
and
wholly
annihilated
so
that
in
a
great
mass
of
sensibly
active
people
one
can
discover
to
use
the
mildest
terms
nothing
but
folly
and
madness
even
their
tender
poems
are
occupied
with
mournful
subjects
here
a
deserted
girl
is
dying
there
a
faithful
lover
is
drowned
or
is
devoured
by
a
shark
before
by
his
hurried
swimming
he
reaches
his
beloved
and
if
a
poet
like
gray
lies
down
in
a
churchyard
and
again
begins
those
melodies
he
too
may
gather
round
him
a
number
of
friends
to
melancholy
milton
must
scare
away
gloom
in
vehement
verses
before
he
can
attain
a
very
moderate
pleasure
and
even
the
cheerful
goldsmith
loses
himself
in
elegiac
feelings
when
his
as
charmingly
as
sadly
exhibits
to
us
a
lost
paradise
which
his
seeks
over
the
whole
earth
i
do
not
doubt
that
lively
works
cheerful
poems
can
be
brought
forward
and
opposed
to
what
i
have
said
but
the
greatest
number
and
the
best
of
them
certainly
belong
to
the
older
epoch
and
the
newer
works
which
may
be
set
down
in
the
class
are
likewise
of
a
satirical
tendency
are
bitter
and
treat
women
especially
with
contempt
enough
those
serious
poems
undermining
human
nature
which
in
general
terms
have
been
mentioned
above
were
the
favourites
which
we
sought
out
before
all
others
one
seeking
according
to
his
disposition
the
lighter
elegiac
melancholy
another
the
heavy
oppressive
despair
which
gives
up
everything
strangely
enough
our
father
and
instructor
shakspeare
who
so
well
knew
how
to
diffuse
a
pure
cheerfulness
strengthened
our
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
hamlet
and
his
soliloquies
were
spectres
which
haunted
all
the
young
minds
the
chief
passages
every
one
knew
by
heart
and
loved
to
recite
and
every
body
fancied
he
had
a
right
to
be
just
as
melancholy
as
the
prince
of
denmark
though
he
had
seen
no
ghost
and
had
no
royal
father
to
avenge
but
that
to
all
this
melancholy
a
perfectly
suitable
locality
might
not
be
wanting
ossian
had
charmed
us
even
to
the
where
on
a
gray
boundless
heath
wandering
among
prominent
we
saw
the
grass
around
us
moved
by
an
awful
wind
and
a
heavily
clouded
sky
above
us
it
was
not
till
moonlight
that
the
caledonian
night
became
day
departed
heroes
faded
maidens
floated
around
us
until
at
last
we
really
thought
we
saw
the
spirit
of
loda
in
his
fearful
form
in
such
an
element
with
such
surrounding
influences
with
tastes
and
studies
of
this
kind
tortured
by
unsatisfied
passions
by
no
means
excited
from
without
to
important
actions
with
the
sole
prospect
that
we
must
adhere
to
a
dull
spiritless
citizen
life
we
became
in
gloomy
wantonness
attached
to
the
thought
that
we
could
at
all
events
quit
life
at
pleasure
if
it
no
longer
suited
us
and
thus
miserably
enough
helped
ourselves
through
the
disgusts
and
weariness
of
the
days
this
feeling
was
so
general
that
produced
its
great
effect
precisely
because
it
struck
a
chord
everywhere
and
openly
and
intelligibly
exhibited
the
internal
nature
of
a
morbid
youthful
delusion
how
accurately
the
english
were
acquainted
with
this
sort
of
wretchedness
is
shown
by
the
few
significant
lines
written
before
the
appearance
of
to
griefs
congenial
prone
more
wounds
than
nature
gave
he
knew
while
misery
form
his
fancy
drew
in
dark
ideal
hues
and
horrors
not
its
own
suicide
suicide
is
an
event
of
human
nature
which
whatever
may
be
said
and
done
with
respect
to
it
demands
the
sympathy
of
every
man
and
in
every
epoch
must
be
discussed
anew
montesquieu
grants
his
heroes
and
great
men
the
right
of
killing
themselves
as
they
think
fit
since
he
says
that
it
must
be
free
to
every
one
to
close
the
fifth
act
of
his
tragedy
as
he
pleases
but
here
the
discourse
is
not
of
those
persons
who
have
led
an
active
and
important
life
who
have
sacrificed
their
days
for
a
great
empire
or
for
the
cause
of
freedom
and
whom
one
can
not
blame
if
they
think
to
follow
in
another
world
the
idea
which
inspires
them
as
soon
as
it
has
vanished
from
the
earth
we
have
here
to
do
with
those
whose
life
is
embittered
by
a
want
of
action
in
the
midst
of
the
most
peaceful
circumstances
in
the
world
through
exaggerated
demands
upon
themselves
since
i
myself
was
in
this
predicament
and
best
knew
the
pain
i
suffered
in
it
and
the
exertion
it
cost
me
to
free
myself
i
will
not
conceal
the
reflections
which
i
made
with
much
deliberation
on
the
various
kinds
of
death
which
one
might
choose
there
is
something
so
unnatural
in
a
man
tearing
himself
away
from
himself
not
only
injuring
but
destroying
himself
that
he
mostly
seizes
upon
mechanical
means
to
carry
his
design
into
execution
when
ajax
falls
upon
his
sword
it
is
the
weight
of
his
body
which
does
him
the
last
service
when
the
warrior
binds
his
not
to
let
him
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
it
is
still
an
external
force
which
he
secures
only
a
moral
instead
of
a
physical
one
women
seek
in
water
a
cooling
for
their
despair
and
the
extremely
mechanical
means
of
ensure
a
rapid
act
with
the
very
least
exertion
hanging
one
does
not
like
to
mention
because
it
is
an
ignoble
death
in
england
one
may
first
find
it
because
there
from
youth
upwards
one
sees
so
many
hanged
without
the
punishment
being
precisely
dishonourable
by
poison
by
opening
the
veins
the
only
intention
is
to
depart
slowly
from
life
and
that
most
refined
rapid
and
painless
death
by
an
adder
was
worthy
of
a
queen
who
had
passed
her
life
in
pleasure
and
brilliancy
but
all
these
are
external
aids
enemies
with
which
man
forms
an
alliance
against
himself
when
now
i
considered
all
these
means
and
looked
about
further
in
history
i
found
among
all
those
who
killed
themselves
no
one
who
did
this
deed
with
such
greatness
and
freedom
of
mind
as
the
emperor
otho
he
having
the
worst
of
it
as
a
general
but
being
by
no
means
reduced
to
extremities
resolves
to
quit
the
world
for
the
benefit
of
the
empire
which
in
some
measure
already
belongs
to
him
and
for
the
sake
of
sparing
so
many
thousands
he
has
a
cheerful
supper
with
his
friends
and
the
next
morning
it
is
found
that
he
has
plunged
a
sharp
dagger
into
his
heart
this
deed
alone
seemed
to
me
worthy
of
imitation
and
i
was
convinced
that
whoever
could
not
act
in
this
like
otho
had
no
right
to
go
voluntarily
out
of
the
world
by
these
convictions
i
freed
myself
not
so
much
from
the
danger
as
from
the
whim
of
suicide
which
in
those
splendid
times
of
peace
and
with
an
indolent
youth
had
managed
to
creep
in
among
a
considerable
collection
of
weapons
i
possessed
a
handsome
well
polished
dagger
this
i
laid
every
night
by
my
bed
and
before
i
extinguished
the
candle
i
tried
whether
i
could
succeed
in
plunging
the
sharp
point
a
couple
of
inches
deep
into
my
heart
since
i
never
could
succeed
in
this
i
at
last
laughed
myself
out
of
the
notion
threw
off
all
hypochondriacal
fancies
and
resolved
to
live
but
to
be
able
to
do
this
with
cheerfulness
i
was
obliged
to
solve
a
poetical
problem
by
which
all
that
i
had
felt
thought
and
fancied
upon
this
important
point
should
be
reduced
to
words
for
this
purpose
i
collected
the
elements
which
had
been
at
work
in
me
for
a
few
years
i
rendered
present
to
my
mind
the
cases
which
had
most
afflicted
and
tormented
me
but
nothing
would
come
to
a
definite
form
i
lacked
an
event
a
fable
in
which
they
could
be
overlooked
jerusalem
death
all
at
once
i
heard
the
news
of
jerusalem
death
and
immediately
after
the
general
report
the
most
accurate
and
circumstantial
description
of
the
occurrence
and
at
this
moment
the
plan
of
was
formed
and
the
whole
shot
together
from
all
sides
and
became
a
solid
mass
just
as
water
in
a
vessel
which
stands
upon
the
point
of
freezing
is
concerted
into
hard
ice
by
the
most
gentle
shake
to
hold
fast
this
singular
prize
to
render
present
to
myself
and
to
carry
out
in
all
its
parts
a
work
of
such
important
and
various
contents
was
the
more
material
to
me
as
i
had
again
fallen
into
a
painful
situation
which
left
me
even
less
hope
than
those
which
had
preceded
it
and
foreboded
only
sadness
if
not
vexation
it
is
always
a
misfortune
to
step
into
new
relations
to
which
one
has
not
been
inured
we
are
often
against
our
will
lured
into
a
false
sympathy
the
incompleteness
of
such
positions
troubles
us
and
yet
we
see
no
means
either
of
completing
them
or
of
removing
them
frau
von
laroche
had
married
her
eldest
daughter
at
frankfort
and
often
came
to
visit
her
but
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
position
which
she
herself
had
chosen
instead
of
feeling
comfortable
or
endeavouring
to
make
any
alteration
she
indulged
in
lamentations
so
that
one
was
really
forced
to
think
that
her
daughter
was
unhappy
although
as
she
wanted
nothing
and
her
husband
denied
her
nothing
one
could
not
well
see
in
what
her
unhappiness
properly
consisted
in
the
meanwhile
i
was
well
received
in
the
house
and
came
into
contact
with
the
whole
circle
which
consisted
of
persons
who
had
partly
contributed
to
the
marriage
partly
wished
for
it
a
happy
result
the
dean
of
leonhard
dumeitz
conceived
a
confidence
nay
a
friendship
for
me
he
was
the
first
catholic
clergyman
with
whom
i
had
come
into
close
contact
and
who
because
he
was
a
man
gave
me
beautiful
and
sufficient
explanations
of
the
faith
usages
and
external
and
internal
relations
of
the
oldest
church
the
figure
of
a
though
not
young
lady
named
servières
i
still
accurately
remember
i
likewise
came
into
contact
with
the
and
other
families
forming
a
connexion
with
the
sons
which
long
continued
in
the
most
friendly
manner
and
all
at
once
found
myself
domesticated
in
a
strange
circle
in
the
occupations
pleasures
and
even
religious
exercises
of
winch
i
was
induced
nay
compelled
to
take
part
my
former
relation
to
the
young
wife
which
was
properly
speaking
only
that
of
a
brother
to
a
sister
was
continued
after
marriage
my
age
was
suitable
to
her
own
i
was
the
only
one
in
the
whole
circle
in
whom
she
heard
an
echo
of
those
intellectual
tones
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
from
her
youth
we
lived
on
together
in
a
childish
confidence
and
although
there
was
nothing
impassioned
in
our
intercourse
it
was
tormenting
enough
because
she
also
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
her
new
circumstances
and
although
blessed
with
the
goods
of
fortune
had
to
act
as
the
mother
of
several
being
moreover
transplanted
from
the
cheerful
vale
of
ehrenbreitstein
and
a
joyous
state
of
youth
into
a
mercantile
house
amid
so
many
new
family
connexions
was
i
hemmed
in
without
any
real
participation
or
if
they
were
satisfied
with
each
other
all
seemed
to
go
on
as
a
matter
of
course
but
most
of
the
parties
concerned
turned
to
me
in
cases
of
vexation
which
by
my
lively
sympathy
i
generally
rendered
worse
rather
than
better
in
a
short
time
this
situation
became
quite
insupportable
to
me
all
the
disgust
at
life
which
usually
springs
from
such
seemed
to
burden
me
with
double
and
weight
and
a
new
strong
resolution
was
necessary
to
free
myself
from
it
jerusalem
death
which
was
occasioned
by
his
unhappy
attachment
to
the
wife
of
his
friend
shook
me
out
of
the
dream
and
because
i
not
only
visibly
contemplated
that
which
had
occurred
to
him
and
me
but
something
similar
which
befel
me
at
the
moment
also
stirred
me
to
passionate
emotion
i
could
not
do
otherwise
than
breathe
into
that
production
which
i
had
just
undertaken
all
that
warmth
which
leaves
no
distinction
between
the
poetical
and
the
actual
i
had
completely
isolated
myself
nay
prohibited
the
visits
of
my
friends
and
internally
also
i
put
everything
aside
that
did
not
immediately
belong
to
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
i
embraced
everything
that
had
any
relation
to
my
design
and
repeated
to
myself
my
nearest
life
of
the
contents
of
which
i
had
as
yet
made
no
practical
use
under
such
circumstances
after
such
long
and
so
many
preparations
in
secret
i
wrote
in
four
weeks
without
any
scheme
of
the
whole
or
treatment
of
any
part
being
previously
put
on
paper
werther
the
manuscript
which
was
now
finished
lay
before
me
as
a
rough
draught
with
few
corrections
and
alterations
it
was
stitched
at
once
for
the
binding
is
to
a
written
work
of
about
the
same
use
as
the
frame
is
to
a
picture
one
can
much
better
see
whether
there
is
really
anything
in
it
since
i
had
written
thus
much
almost
unconsciously
like
a
somnambulist
i
was
myself
astonished
now
i
went
through
it
that
i
might
alter
and
improve
it
in
some
respects
but
in
the
expectation
that
after
some
time
when
i
had
seen
it
at
a
certain
distance
much
would
occur
to
me
that
would
turn
to
the
advantage
of
the
work
i
gave
it
to
my
younger
friends
to
read
upon
whom
it
produced
an
effect
so
much
the
greater
as
contrary
to
my
usual
custom
i
had
told
no
one
of
it
nor
discovered
my
design
beforehand
yet
here
again
it
was
the
which
really
produced
the
effect
and
in
this
respect
they
were
in
a
frame
of
mind
precisely
the
reverse
of
my
own
for
by
this
composition
more
than
by
any
other
i
had
freed
myself
from
that
stormy
element
upon
which
through
my
own
fault
and
that
of
others
through
a
mode
of
life
both
accidental
and
chosen
through
design
and
thoughtless
precipitation
through
obstinacy
and
pliability
i
had
been
driven
about
in
the
most
violent
manner
i
felt
as
if
after
a
general
confession
once
more
happy
and
free
and
justified
in
beginning
a
new
life
the
old
nostrum
had
been
of
excellent
service
to
me
on
this
occasion
but
while
i
felt
myself
eased
and
enlightened
by
having
turned
reality
into
poetry
my
friends
were
led
astray
by
my
work
for
they
thought
that
poetry
ought
to
be
turned
into
reality
that
such
a
moral
was
to
be
imitated
and
that
at
any
rate
one
ought
to
shoot
oneself
what
had
first
happened
here
among
a
few
afterwards
took
place
among
the
larger
public
and
this
little
book
which
had
been
so
beneficial
to
me
was
decried
as
extremely
injurious
but
all
the
evils
and
misfortunes
which
it
may
have
produced
were
nearly
prevented
by
an
accident
since
even
after
its
production
it
ran
the
risk
of
being
destroyed
the
matter
stood
thus
merck
had
lately
returned
from
petersburg
i
had
spoken
to
him
but
little
because
he
was
always
occupied
and
only
told
him
in
the
most
general
terms
of
that
which
lay
next
my
heart
he
once
called
upon
me
and
as
he
did
not
seem
very
talkative
i
asked
him
to
listen
to
me
he
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
and
i
began
to
read
the
tale
letter
by
letter
after
i
had
gone
on
thus
for
a
while
without
gaining
from
him
any
sign
of
admiration
i
adopted
a
more
pathetic
strain
but
what
were
my
feelings
when
at
a
pause
which
i
made
he
struck
me
down
in
the
most
frightful
manner
with
good
that
very
pretty
and
withdrew
without
adding
anything
more
i
was
quite
beside
myself
for
as
i
took
great
pleasure
in
my
works
but
at
first
passed
no
judgment
on
them
i
here
firmly
believed
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
subject
tone
and
style
all
of
which
were
doubtful
and
had
produced
something
quite
inadmissible
had
a
fire
been
at
hand
i
should
at
once
have
thrown
in
the
work
but
i
again
plucked
up
courage
and
passed
many
painful
days
until
he
at
last
assured
me
in
confidence
that
at
that
moment
he
had
been
in
the
most
frightful
situation
in
which
a
man
can
be
placed
on
this
account
he
said
he
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
and
did
not
even
know
what
the
manuscript
was
about
in
the
meanwhile
the
matter
had
been
set
right
as
far
as
was
possible
and
merck
in
the
times
of
his
energy
was
just
the
man
to
accommodate
himself
to
anything
monstrous
his
humour
returned
only
it
had
grown
still
more
bitter
than
before
he
blamed
my
design
of
rewriting
with
the
same
expressions
which
he
had
used
on
a
former
occasion
and
desired
to
see
it
printed
just
as
it
was
a
fair
copy
was
made
which
did
not
remain
long
in
my
hands
for
on
the
very
day
on
which
my
sister
was
married
to
george
schlosser
a
letter
from
weygand
of
leipzig
chanced
to
arrive
in
which
he
asked
me
for
a
manuscript
such
a
coincidence
i
looked
upon
as
a
favourable
omen
i
sent
off
and
was
very
well
satisfied
when
the
remuneration
i
received
for
it
was
not
entirely
swallowed
up
by
the
debts
which
i
had
been
forced
to
contract
on
account
of
von
effect
of
werther
the
effect
of
this
little
book
was
great
nay
immense
and
chiefly
because
it
exactly
hit
the
temper
of
the
times
for
as
it
requires
but
a
little
match
to
blow
up
an
immense
mine
so
the
explosion
which
followed
my
publication
was
mighty
from
the
circumstance
that
the
youthful
world
had
already
undermined
itself
and
the
shock
was
great
because
all
extravagant
demands
unsatisfied
passions
and
imaginary
wrongs
were
suddenly
brought
to
an
eruption
it
can
not
be
expected
of
the
public
that
it
should
receive
an
intellectual
work
intellectually
in
fact
it
was
only
the
subject
the
material
part
that
was
considered
as
i
had
already
found
to
be
the
case
among
my
own
friends
while
at
the
same
time
arose
that
old
prejudice
associated
with
the
dignity
of
a
printed
book
that
it
ought
to
have
a
moral
aim
but
a
true
picture
of
life
has
none
it
neither
approves
nor
censures
but
developes
sentiments
and
actions
in
their
consequences
and
thereby
enlightens
and
instructs
of
the
reviews
i
took
little
notice
i
had
completely
washed
my
hands
of
the
matter
and
the
good
folks
might
now
try
what
they
could
make
of
it
yet
my
friends
did
not
fail
to
collect
these
things
and
as
they
were
already
initiated
into
my
views
to
make
merry
with
them
the
of
young
with
which
nicolai
came
forth
gave
us
occasion
for
many
a
jest
this
otherwise
excellent
meritorious
and
man
had
already
begun
to
depreciate
and
oppose
everything
that
did
not
accord
with
his
own
way
of
thinking
which
as
he
was
of
a
very
narrow
mind
he
held
to
be
the
only
correct
way
against
me
too
he
must
needs
try
his
strength
and
his
pamphlet
was
soon
in
our
hands
the
very
delicate
vignette
by
chodowiecki
gave
me
much
delight
as
at
that
time
i
admired
this
artist
extravagantly
the
jumbling
medley
itself
was
cut
out
of
that
rough
household
stuff
which
the
human
understanding
in
its
homely
limits
takes
especial
pains
to
make
sufficiently
coarse
without
perceiving
that
there
was
nothing
here
to
qualify
that
werther
youthful
bloom
from
the
very
first
appears
gnawed
by
the
deadly
worm
nicolai
allows
my
treatment
to
pass
current
up
to
the
two
hundred
and
fourteenth
page
and
then
when
the
desolate
mortal
is
preparing
for
the
fatal
step
the
acute
psychological
physician
contrives
to
palm
upon
his
patient
a
pistol
loaded
with
chickens
blood
from
which
a
filthy
spectacle
but
happily
no
mischief
arises
charlotte
becomes
the
wife
of
werther
and
the
whole
affair
ends
to
the
satisfaction
of
everybody
so
much
i
can
recall
to
memory
for
the
book
never
came
before
my
eyes
again
i
had
cut
out
the
vignette
and
placed
it
among
my
most
favourite
engravings
i
then
by
way
of
quiet
innocent
revenge
composed
a
little
burlesque
poem
nicolai
at
the
grave
of
werther
which
however
can
not
be
communicated
on
this
occasion
too
the
pleasure
of
giving
everything
a
dramatic
shape
was
again
predominant
i
wrote
a
prose
dialogue
between
charlotte
and
werther
which
was
tolerably
comical
werther
bitterly
complains
that
his
deliverance
by
chickens
blood
has
turned
out
so
badly
his
life
is
saved
it
is
true
but
he
has
shot
his
eyes
out
he
is
now
in
despair
at
being
her
husband
without
being
able
to
see
her
for
the
complete
view
of
her
person
would
to
him
be
much
dearer
than
all
those
pretty
details
of
which
he
could
assure
himself
by
the
touch
charlotte
as
may
be
imagined
has
no
great
catch
in
a
blind
husband
and
thus
occasion
is
given
to
abuse
nicolai
pretty
roundly
for
interfering
unasked
in
other
people
affairs
the
whole
was
written
in
a
spirit
and
painted
with
prophetic
forebodings
that
unhappy
conceited
humour
of
nicolai
which
led
him
to
meddle
with
things
beyond
his
compass
which
gave
great
annoyance
both
to
himself
and
others
and
by
which
eventually
in
spite
of
his
undoubted
merits
he
entirely
destroyed
his
literary
reputation
the
original
of
this
was
never
copied
and
has
been
lost
sight
of
for
years
i
had
a
special
predilection
for
the
little
production
the
pure
ardent
attachment
of
the
two
young
persons
was
rather
heightened
than
diminished
by
the
situation
into
which
they
were
thus
transposed
the
greatest
tenderness
prevailed
throughout
and
even
my
adversary
was
not
treated
illnaturedly
but
only
humourously
i
did
not
however
let
the
book
itself
speak
quite
so
politely
in
imitation
of
an
old
rhyme
it
expressed
itself
thus
by
that
conceited
man
by
i
dangerous
declar
the
heavy
man
who
can
not
swim
is
by
the
water
scar
that
berlin
pack
lot
their
ban
i
do
not
heed
and
those
who
understand
me
not
should
better
learn
to
read
effect
of
werther
being
prepared
for
all
that
might
be
alleged
against
i
found
those
attacks
numerous
as
they
were
by
no
means
annoying
but
i
had
no
anticipation
of
the
intolerable
torment
provided
for
me
by
sympathizers
and
these
instead
of
saying
anything
civil
to
me
about
my
book
just
as
it
was
wished
to
know
one
and
all
what
was
really
true
in
it
at
which
i
grew
very
angry
and
often
expressed
myself
with
great
discourtesy
to
answer
this
question
i
should
have
been
obliged
to
pull
to
pieces
and
destroy
the
form
of
a
work
on
which
i
had
so
long
pondered
with
the
view
of
giving
a
poetical
unity
to
its
many
elements
and
in
this
operation
if
the
essential
parts
were
not
destroyed
they
would
at
least
have
been
scattered
and
dispersed
however
upon
a
closer
consideration
of
the
matter
i
could
not
take
the
public
inquisitiveness
in
ill
part
jerusalem
fate
had
excited
great
attention
an
educated
amiable
blameless
young
man
the
son
of
one
of
the
first
theologians
and
authors
healthy
and
opulent
had
at
once
without
any
known
cause
destroyed
himself
every
one
asked
how
this
was
possible
and
when
they
heard
of
an
unfortunate
love
affair
the
whole
youth
were
excited
and
as
soon
as
it
transpired
that
some
little
annoyances
had
occurred
to
him
in
the
higher
circles
the
middle
classes
also
became
excited
indeed
every
one
was
anxious
to
learn
further
particulars
now
appeared
an
exact
delineation
as
it
was
thought
of
the
life
and
character
of
that
young
man
the
locality
and
person
tallied
and
the
narrative
was
so
very
natural
that
they
considered
themselves
fully
informed
and
satisfied
but
on
the
other
hand
on
closer
examination
there
was
so
much
that
did
not
fit
that
there
arose
for
those
who
sought
the
truth
an
unmanageable
business
because
a
critical
investigation
must
necessarily
produce
a
hundred
doubts
the
real
groundwork
of
the
affair
was
however
not
to
be
fathomed
for
all
that
i
had
interwoven
of
my
own
life
and
suffering
could
not
be
deciphered
because
as
an
unobserved
young
man
i
had
secretly
though
not
silently
pursued
my
course
while
engaged
in
my
work
i
was
fully
aware
how
highly
that
artist
was
favoured
who
had
an
opportunity
of
composing
a
venus
from
the
study
of
a
variety
of
beauties
accordingly
i
took
leave
to
model
my
charlotte
according
to
the
shape
and
qualities
of
several
pretty
girls
although
the
chief
characteristics
were
taken
from
the
one
i
loved
best
the
inquisitive
public
could
therefore
discover
similarities
in
various
ladies
and
even
to
the
ladies
themselves
it
was
not
quite
indifferent
to
be
taken
for
the
right
one
but
these
several
charlottes
caused
me
infinite
trouble
because
every
one
who
only
looked
at
me
seemed
determined
to
know
where
the
proper
one
really
resided
i
endeavoured
to
save
myself
like
nathan
with
the
three
rings
by
an
expedient
which
though
it
might
suit
higher
beings
would
not
satisfy
either
the
believing
or
the
reading
public
i
hoped
after
a
time
to
be
freed
from
such
tormenting
inquiries
but
they
pursued
me
through
my
whole
life
i
sought
on
my
travels
to
escape
them
by
assuming
an
but
even
this
remedy
was
to
my
disappointment
unavailing
and
thus
the
author
of
the
little
work
had
he
even
done
anything
wrong
and
mischievous
was
sufficiently
i
may
say
disproportionately
punished
by
such
unavoidable
importunities
subjected
to
this
kind
of
infliction
i
was
taught
but
too
unequivocally
that
authors
and
their
public
are
separated
by
an
immense
gulf
of
which
happily
neither
of
them
have
any
conception
the
uselessness
therefore
of
all
prefaces
i
had
long
ago
seen
for
the
more
pains
a
writer
takes
to
render
his
views
clear
the
more
occasion
he
gives
for
embarrassment
besides
an
author
may
preface
as
elaborately
as
he
will
the
public
will
always
go
on
making
precisely
those
demands
which
he
has
endeavoured
to
avoid
with
a
kindred
peculiarity
of
readers
which
particularly
with
those
who
print
their
judgments
seems
remarkably
comical
i
was
likewise
soon
acquainted
they
live
for
instance
in
the
delusion
that
an
author
in
producing
anything
becomes
their
debtor
and
he
always
falls
short
of
what
they
wished
and
expected
of
him
although
before
they
had
seen
our
work
they
had
not
the
least
notion
that
anything
of
the
kind
existed
or
was
even
possible
independent
of
all
this
it
was
now
the
greatest
fortune
or
misfortune
that
every
one
wished
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
this
strange
young
author
who
had
stepped
forward
so
unexpectedly
and
so
boldly
they
desired
to
see
him
to
speak
to
him
and
even
at
a
distance
to
hear
something
from
him
thus
he
had
to
undergo
a
very
considerable
crowd
sometimes
pleasant
sometimes
disagreeable
but
always
distracting
for
enough
works
already
begun
lay
before
him
nay
and
would
have
given
him
abundance
of
work
for
some
years
if
he
could
have
kept
to
them
with
his
old
fervour
but
he
was
drawn
forth
from
the
quiet
the
twilight
the
obscurity
which
alone
can
favour
pure
creation
into
the
noise
of
daylight
where
one
is
lost
in
others
where
one
is
led
astray
alike
by
sympathy
and
by
coldness
by
praise
and
by
blame
because
outward
contact
never
accords
with
the
epoch
of
our
inner
culture
and
therefore
as
it
can
not
further
us
must
necessarily
injure
us
dramatic
tendency
yet
more
than
by
all
the
distractions
of
the
day
the
author
was
kept
from
the
elaboration
and
completion
of
greater
works
by
the
taste
then
prevalent
in
this
society
for
everything
of
importance
which
occurred
in
actual
life
what
that
technical
expression
for
such
it
was
in
our
inventive
society
really
meant
shall
here
be
explained
excited
by
intellectual
meetings
on
days
of
hilarity
we
were
accustomed
in
short
extemporary
performances
to
communicate
in
fragments
all
the
materials
we
had
collected
towards
the
formation
of
larger
compositions
one
single
simple
incident
a
pleasantly
or
even
silly
word
a
blunder
a
paradox
a
clever
remark
personal
singularities
or
habits
nay
a
peculiar
expression
and
whatever
else
would
occur
in
a
gay
and
bustling
life
took
the
form
of
a
dialogue
a
catechism
a
passing
scene
or
a
drama
often
in
prose
but
oftener
in
verse
by
this
practice
carried
on
with
genial
passion
the
really
poetic
mode
of
thought
was
established
we
allowed
objects
events
persons
to
stand
for
themselves
in
all
their
bearings
our
only
endeavour
being
to
comprehend
them
clearly
and
exhibit
them
vividly
every
expression
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
was
to
pass
in
living
forms
before
the
eyes
of
the
spectator
these
productions
might
be
called
animated
epigrams
which
though
without
edges
or
points
were
richly
furnished
with
marked
and
striking
features
the
is
an
epigram
of
this
kind
or
rather
a
collection
of
such
epigrams
all
the
characters
there
introduced
are
meant
for
actual
living
members
of
that
society
or
for
persons
at
least
connected
and
in
some
degree
known
to
it
but
the
meaning
of
the
riddle
remained
concealed
to
the
greater
part
all
laughed
and
few
knew
that
their
own
marked
peculiarities
served
as
the
jest
the
prologue
to
newest
may
be
looked
upon
as
a
document
of
another
kind
the
smallest
pieces
are
among
the
miscellaneous
poems
a
great
many
have
been
destroyed
or
lost
and
some
that
still
exist
do
not
admit
of
being
published
those
which
appeared
in
print
only
increased
the
excitement
of
the
public
and
curiosity
about
the
author
those
which
were
handed
about
in
manuscript
entertained
the
immediate
circle
which
was
continually
increasing
doctor
bahrdt
then
at
giessen
paid
me
a
visit
apparently
courteous
and
confiding
he
laughed
over
the
prologue
and
wished
to
be
placed
on
a
friendly
footing
but
we
young
people
still
continued
to
omit
no
opportunity
at
social
festivals
of
sporting
in
a
malicious
vein
at
the
peculiarities
which
we
had
remarked
in
others
and
successfully
exhibited
if
now
it
was
by
no
means
displeasing
to
the
young
author
to
be
stared
at
as
a
literary
meteor
he
nevertheless
sought
with
glad
modesty
to
testify
his
esteem
for
the
most
deserving
men
of
his
country
among
whom
before
all
others
the
admirable
justus
möser
claims
especial
mention
the
little
essays
on
political
subjects
by
this
incomparable
man
had
been
printed
some
years
before
in
the
and
made
known
to
me
through
herder
who
overlooked
nothing
of
worth
that
appeared
in
his
time
especially
if
in
print
moser
daughter
frau
von
voigt
was
occupied
in
collecting
these
scattered
papers
we
had
scarcely
patience
to
wait
for
their
publication
and
i
placed
myself
in
communication
with
her
to
assure
her
with
sincere
interest
that
the
essays
which
both
in
matter
and
form
had
been
addressed
only
to
a
limited
circle
would
be
useful
and
beneficial
everywhere
she
and
her
father
received
these
assurances
from
a
stranger
not
altogether
unknown
in
the
kindest
manner
since
an
anxiety
which
they
had
felt
was
thus
preliminarily
removed
what
is
in
the
highest
degree
remarkable
and
commendable
in
these
little
essays
all
of
which
being
composed
in
one
spirit
form
together
a
perfect
whole
is
the
very
intimate
knowledge
they
display
of
the
whole
civil
state
of
man
we
see
a
system
resting
upon
the
past
and
still
in
vigorous
existence
on
the
one
hand
there
is
a
firm
adherence
to
tradition
on
the
other
movement
and
change
which
can
not
be
prevented
here
alarm
is
felt
at
a
useful
novelty
there
pleasure
in
what
is
new
although
it
be
useless
or
even
injurious
with
what
freedom
from
prejudice
the
author
explains
the
relative
position
of
different
ranks
and
the
connexion
in
which
cities
towns
and
villages
mutually
stand
we
learn
their
prerogatives
together
with
the
legal
grounds
of
them
we
are
told
where
the
main
capital
of
the
state
is
invested
and
what
interest
it
yields
we
see
property
and
its
advantages
on
the
one
hand
on
the
other
taxes
and
disadvantages
of
various
kinds
and
then
the
numerous
branches
of
industry
and
in
all
this
past
and
present
times
are
contrasted
osnaburg
as
a
member
of
the
hanseatic
league
we
are
told
had
in
the
earlier
periods
an
extensive
and
active
commerce
according
to
the
circumstances
of
those
times
it
had
a
remarkable
and
fine
situation
it
could
receive
the
produce
of
the
country
and
was
not
too
far
removed
from
the
sea
to
transport
it
in
its
own
ships
but
now
in
later
times
it
lies
deep
in
the
interior
and
is
gradually
removed
and
shut
out
from
the
sea
trade
how
this
has
occurred
is
explained
in
all
its
bearings
the
conflict
between
england
and
the
coasts
and
of
the
havens
with
the
interior
is
mentioned
here
are
set
forth
the
great
advantages
of
those
who
live
on
the
and
deliberate
plans
are
proposed
for
enabling
the
inhabitants
of
the
interior
to
obtain
similar
advantages
we
then
learn
a
great
deal
about
trades
and
handicrafts
and
how
these
have
been
outstripped
by
manufactures
and
undermined
by
decline
is
pointed
out
as
the
result
of
various
causes
and
this
result
in
its
turn
as
the
cause
of
a
further
decline
in
an
endless
circle
which
it
is
difficult
to
unravel
yet
it
is
so
clearly
set
forth
by
the
vigilant
citizen
that
one
fancies
one
can
see
the
way
to
escape
from
it
the
author
throughout
displays
the
clearest
insight
into
the
most
minute
circumstances
his
proposals
his
counsel
nothing
is
drawn
from
the
air
and
yet
they
are
often
impracticable
on
which
account
he
calls
his
collection
patriotic
fancies
although
everything
in
it
is
based
on
the
actual
and
the
possible
justus
moeser
but
as
everything
in
public
life
is
influenced
by
domestic
condition
this
especially
engages
his
attention
as
objects
both
of
his
serious
and
sportive
reflections
we
find
the
changes
in
manners
and
customs
dress
diet
domestic
life
and
education
it
would
be
necessary
to
indicate
everything
which
exists
in
the
civil
and
social
world
to
exhaust
the
list
of
subjects
which
he
discusses
and
his
treatment
of
them
is
admirable

thorough
man

business
discourses
with
the
people
in
weekly
papers
respecting
whatever
a
wise
and
beneficent
government
undertakes
or
carries
out
that
he
may
bring
it
to
their
comprehension
in
its
true
light
this
is
by
no
means
done
in
a
learned
manner
but
in
those
varied
forms
which
may
be
called
poetic
and
which
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
must
certainly
be
considered
rhetorical
he
is
always
elevated
above
his
subject
and
understands
how
to
give
a
cheerful
view
of
the
most
serious
subjects
now
behind
this
or
that
mask
now
speaking
in
his
own
person
always
complete
and
exhausting
his
subject
at
the
same
time
always
in
good
humour
more
or
less
ironical
thoroughly
to
the
purpose
honest
sometimes
rough
and
vehement
and
all
this
so
well
regulated
that
the
spirit
understanding
facility
skill
taste
and
character
of
the
author
can
not
but
be
admired
in
the
choice
of
subjects
of
general
utility
deep
insight
enlarged
views
happy
treatment
profound
yet
cheerful
humour
i
know
no
one
to
whom
i
can
compare
him
but
franklin
such
a
man
had
an
imposing
effect
upon
us
and
greatly
influenced
a
youthful
generation
which
demanded
something
sound
and
stood
ready
to
appreciate
it
we
thought
we
could
adapt
ourselves
to
the
form
of
his
exposition
but
who
could
hope
to
make
himself
master
of
so
rich
an
entertainment
and
to
handle
the
most
unmanageable
subjects
with
so
much
ease
but
this
is
our
purest
and
sweetest
illusion
one
which
we
can
not
resign
however
much
pain
it
may
cause
us
through
life
that
we
would
where
possible
appropriate
to
ourselves

book
with
the
movement
which
was
spreading
among
the
public
now
arose
another
of
greater
importance
perhaps
to
the
author
as
it
took
place
in
his
immediate
circle
his
early
friends
who
had
read
in
manuscript
those
poetical
compositions
which
were
now
creating
so
much
sensation
and
therefore
regarded
them
almost
as
their
own
gloried
in
a
success
which
they
had
boldly
enough
predicted
this
number
was
augmented
by
new
adherents
especially
by
such
as
felt
conscious
of
a
creative
power
in
themselves
or
were
desirous
of
calling
one
forth
and
cultivating
it

lenz
was
the
most
active
and
he
deported
himself
strangely
enough
i
have
already
sketched
the
outward
appearance
of
this
remarkable
mortal
and
have
touched
affectionately
on
his
talent
for
humor
i
will
now
speak
of
his
character
in
its
results
rather
than
descriptively
because
it
would
be
impossible
to
follow
him
through
the
mazy
course
of
his
life
and
to
transfer
to
these
pages
a
full
exhibition
of
his
peculiarities
generally
known
is
that
which
in
the
lack
of
all
outward
grievances
had
now
become
fashionable
and
which
disturbed
the
very
best
minds
that
which
gives
but
a
transient
pain
to
ordinary
men
who
never
themselves
meditate
on
that
which
they
seek
to
banish
from
their
minds
was
by
the
better
order
acutely
observed
regarded
and
recorded
in
books
letters
and
diaries
but
now
men
united
the
strictest
moral
requisitions
on
themselves
and
others
with
an
excessive
negligence
in
action
and
vague
notions
arising
from
this
misled
them
into
the
strangest
habits
and
practices
but
this
painful
work
of
was
justified
by
the
rising
empirical
psychology
which
while
it
was
not
exactly
willing
to
pronounce
everything
that
produces
inward
disquiet
to
be
wicked
and
objectionable
still
could
not
give
it
an
unconditional
approval
and
thus
was
originated
an
eternal
and
inappeasable
contest
in
carrying
on
and
sustaining
this
conflict
lenz
surpassed
all
the
other
idlers
and
dabblers
who
were
occupied
in
mining
into
their
own
souls
and
thus
he
suffered
from
the
universal
tendency
of
the
times
which
was
said
to
have
been
let
loose
by
werther
but
a
personal
peculiarity
distinguished
him
from
all
the
rest
while
they
were
undeniably
frank
and
honest
creatures
he
had
a
decided
inclination
to
intrigue
and
indeed
to
intrigue
for
its
own
sake
without
having
in
view
any
special
object
any
reasonable
attainable
personal
object
on
the
contrary
it
was
always
his
custom
to
propose
to
himself
something
whimsical
which
served
for
that
very
reason
to
keep
him
constantly
occupied
in
this
way
all
his
life
long
he
was
an
imposter
in
his
imagination
his
love
as
well
as
his
hate
was
imaginary
he
dealt
with
his
thoughts
and
feelings
in
a
wilful
manner
so
as
always
to
have
something
to
do
he
endeavoured
to
give
reality
to
his
sympathies
and
antipathies
by
the
most
perverse
means
and
always
himself
destroyed
his
own
work
thus
he
never
benefited
any
one
whom
he
loved
and
never
injured
any
one
whom
he
hated
in
general
he
seemed
to
sin
only
to
punish
himself
and
to
intrigue
for
no
purpose
but
to
graft
a
new
fable
upon
an
old
one
his
talent
in
which
tenderness
facility
and
subtlety
rivalled
each
other
proceeded
from
a
real
depth
from
an
inexhaustible
creative
power
but
was
thoroughly
morbid
with
all
its
beauty
such
qualities
are
precisely
the
most
difficult
to
judge
it
is
impossible
to
overlook
great
features
in
his
works
a
lovely
tenderness
steals
along
through
pieces
of
caricature
so
odd
and
so
silly
that
they
can
hardly
be
pardoned
even
in
a
humor
so
thorough
and
unassuming
and
such
a
genuine
comic
talent
his
days
were
made
up
of
mere
nothings
to
which
his
nimble
fancy
could
ever
give
a
meaning
and
he
was
the
better
able
to
squander
hours
away
since
with
a
happy
memory
the
time
which
he
did
employ
in
reading
was
always
fruitful
and
enriched
his
original
mode
of
thought
with
various
materials
lenz
he
had
been
sent
to
strasburg
with
some
livonian
gentlemen
and
a
more
unfortunate
choice
of
a
mentor
could
not
have
been
made
the
elder
baron
went
back
for
a
time
to
his
native
country
and
left
behind
him
a
lady
to
whom
he
was
tenderly
attached
in
order
to
keep
at
a
distance
the
second
brother
who
was
paying
court
to
the
same
lady
as
well
as
other
lovers
and
to
preserve
the
precious
heart
for
his
absent
friend
lenz
determined
either
to
feign
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
the
beauty
or
if
you
please
actually
to
do
so
he
carried
through
this
plan
with
the
most
obstinate
adherence
to
the
ideal
he
had
formed
of
her
without
being
aware
that
he
as
well
as
the
others
only
served
her
for
jest
and
pastime
so
much
the
better
for
him
for
him
too
it
was
nothing
but
a
game
which
could
only
be
kept
up
by
her
meeting
him
in
the
same
spirit
now
attracting
him
now
repelling
him
now
encouraging
him
and
now
slighting
him
we
may
be
sure
that
if
he
had
become
aware
of
the
way
the
affair
sometimes
went
on
he
would
with
great
delight
have
congratulated
himself
on
the
discovery
as
for
the
rest
he
like
his
pupils
lived
mostly
with
officers
of
the
garrison
and
thus
the
strange
notions
he
afterwards
brought
out
in
his
comedy
the
soldiers
probably
originated
at
any
rate
this
early
acquaintance
with
military
men
had
on
him
the
peculiar
effect
that
he
forthwith
fancied
himself
a
great
judge
of
military
matters
and
yet
from
time
to
time
he
really
studied
the
subject
in
detail
with
such
effect
that
some
years
afterward
he
prepared
a
long
memorial
to
the
french
minister
of
war
from
which
he
promised
himself
the
best
results
the
faults
of
the
department
were
tolerably
well
pointed
out
but
on
the
other
hand
the
remedies
were
ridiculous
and
impracticable
however
he
cherished
a
conviction
that
he
should
by
this
means
gain
great
influence
at
court
and
was
anything
but
grateful
to
those
of
his
friends
who
partly
by
reasoning
and
partly
by
active
opposition
compelled
him
to
suppress
and
afterwards
to
bum
this
fantastic
work
after
it
had
been
put
under
cover
with
a
letter
and
formally
addressed
first
of
all
by
word
of
mouth
and
afterwards
by
letter
he
had
confided
to
me
all
the
mazes
of
his
tortuous
movements
with
regard
to
the
lady
above
mentioned
the
poetry
which
he
could
infuse
into
the
commonest
incidents
often
astonished
me
so
that
i
urged
him
to
employ
his
talents
in
turning
the
essence
of
this
adventure
to
account
and
to
make
a
little
romance
out
of
it
but
that
was
not
in
his
line
he
could
only
succeed
when
he
poured
himself
out
for
ever
upon
details
and
span
an
endless
thread
without
any
purpose
perhaps
it
will
be
possible
at
a
future
time
to
deduce
from
these
premises
some
account
of
his
life
up
to
tho
time
that
he
became
a
lunatic
at
present
i
confine
myself
to
what
is
immediately
connected
with
the
subject
in
hand
hardly
had
götz
von
berlichingen
appeared
when
lenz
sent
me
a
prolix
essay
written
on
small
draught
paper
such
as
he
commonly
used
without
leaving
the
least
margin
either
at
the
top
the
bottom
or
the
sides
it
was
entitled
unsere
on
our
marriage
and
were
it
still
in
existence
might
enlighten
us
much
more
now
than
it
then
did
me
when
i
was
as
yet
in
the
dark
as
to
him
and
his
character
the
leading
purpose
of
this
long
manuscript
was
to
compare
my
talent
with
his
own
now
he
seemed
to
make
himself
inferior
to
me
now
to
represent
himself
as
my
equal
but
it
was
all
done
with
such
humorous
and
neat
turns
of
expression
that
i
gladly
received
the
view
he
intended
to
convey
and
all
the
more
so
as
i
did
in
fact
rate
very
high
the
gifts
he
possessed
and
was
always
urging
him
to
concentrate
himself
out
of
his
aimless
rambling
and
to
use
his
natural
capacities
with
some
artistical
control
i
replied
in
the
most
friendly
way
to
this
confidential
communication
and
as
he
had
encouraged
the
greatest
intimacy
between
us
as
the
whimsical
title
indicates
from
that
time
forward
i
made
known
to
him
everything
i
had
either
finished
or
designed
in
return
he
successively
sent
me
his
manuscripts
private
tutor
neue
the
new
menoza
the
soldiers
the
imitations
of
plautus
and
the
translation
from
the
english
which
i
have
before
spoken
of
as
forming
the
supplement
to
his
remarks
on
the
theatre
while
reading
the
latter
i
was
somewhat
struck
to
find
him
in
a
laconic
preface
speaking
in
such
a
way
as
to
convey
the
idea
that
this
essay
which
contained
a
vehement
attack
upon
the
regular
theatre
had
many
years
before
been
read
to
a
society
of
the
friends
of
literature
at
a
time
in
short
when
götz
was
not
yet
written
that
there
should
have
been
among
lenz
acquaintances
at
strasburg
a
literary
circle
of
which
i
was
ignorant
seemed
somewhat
problematical
however
i
let
it
pass
and
soon
procured
publishers
for
this
and
his
other
writings
without
having
the
least
suspicion
that
he
had
selected
me
as
the
chief
object
of
his
fanciful
hatred
and
as
the
mark
of
an
odd
and
whimsical
persecution
in
passing
i
will
for
the
sake
of
the
sequel
just
mention
a
good
fellow
who
though
of
no
extraordinary
gifts
was
yet
one
of
our
number
he
was
called
wagner
and
was
first
a
member
of
our
strasburg
society
and
then
of
that
at
frankfort
a
man
not
without
spirit
talent
and
education
he
appeared
to
be
a
striving
sort
of
person
and
was
therefore
welcome
he
too
attached
himself
to
me
and
as
i
made
no
secret
of
my
plans
i
shewed
to
him
as
well
as
others
my
sketch
of
the
faust
especially
the
catastrophe
of
gretchen
he
caught
up
the
idea
and
used
it
for
a
tragedy
the
infanticide
it
was
the
first
time
that
any
one
had
stolen
from
me
any
of
my
plans
it
vexed
me
though
i
bore
him
no
ill
will
on
that
account
since
then
i
have
often
enough
suffered
such
robberies
and
anticipations
of
my
thoughts
and
with
my
dilatoriness
and
habit
of
gossipping
about
the
many
things
that
i
was
ever
planning
and
imagining
i
had
no
right
to
complain
klinger
if
on
account
of
the
great
effect
which
contrasts
produce
orators
and
poets
gladly
make
use
of
them
even
at
the
expense
of
seeking
them
out
and
bringing
them
from
a
distance
it
must
be
the
more
agreeable
to
the
present
writer
that
such
a
decided
contrast
presents
itself
in
his
speaking
of
klinger
after
lenz
they
were
contemporaries
and
in
youth
labored
together
but
lenz
as
a
transient
meteor
passed
but
for
a
moment
over
the
horizon
of
german
literature
and
suddenly
vanished
without
leaving
any
trace
behind
klinger
on
the
other
hand
has
maintained
his
position
up
to
the
present
time
as
an
author
of
influence
and
an
active
man
of
business
of
him
i
will
now
speak
as
far
as
it
is
necessary
without
following
any
farther
a
comparison
which
suggests
itself
for
it
has
not
been
in
secret
that
he
has
accomplished
so
much
and
exercised
so
great
an
influence
but
both
his
works
and
his
influence
are
still
remembered
far
and
near
and
are
highly
esteemed
and
appreciated
klinger
exterior
for
i
always
like
best
to
begin
with
this
was
very
prepossessing
nature
had
given
him
a
tall
slender
form
and
regular
features
he
was
careful
of
his
appearance
always
dressed
neatly
and
might
justly
have
passed
for
the
smartest
member
of
our
little
society
his
manners
were
neither
forward
nor
repulsive
and
when
not
agitated
by
an
inward
storm
mild
and
gentle
in
girls
we
love
what
they
are
but
in
young
men
what
they
promise
to
be
and
thus
i
was
klinger
friend
as
soon
as
i
made
his
acquaintance
he
recommended
himself
by
a
pure
good
nature
and
an
unmistakeable
decision
of
character
won
him
confidence
from
youth
upward
everything
had
tended
to
incline
him
to
seriousness
together
with
a
beautiful
and
excellent
sister
he
had
to
provide
for
a
mother
who
in
her
widowhood
had
need
of
such
children
for
her
support
he
had
made
himself
everything
that
he
was
so
that
no
one
could
find
fault
with
a
trait
of
proud
independence
which
was
apparent
in
his
bearing
strong
natural
talents
such
as
are
common
to
all
men
a
facile
power
of
apprehension
an
excellent
memory
and
great
fluency
of
speech
he
possessed
in
a
high
degree
but
he
appeared
to
regard
all
these
as
of
less
value
than
the
firmness
and
perseverance
which
were
likewise
innate
with
him
and
which
circumstances
had
abundantly
strengthened
to
a
young
man
of
such
a
character
the
works
of
rousseau
were
especially
attractive
was
his
chief
and
its
sentiments
as
they
had
an
universal
influence
over
the
cultivated
world
were
peculiarly
fruitful
with
him
and
influenced
him
more
than
others
for
he
too
was
a
child
of
nature
he
too
had
worked
his
way
upwards
what
others
had
been
compelled
to
cast
away
he
had
never
possessed
relations
of
society
from
which
they
would
have
to
emancipate
themselves
had
never
fettered
him
thus
might
he
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
purest
disciples
of
that
gospel
of
nature
and
in
view
of
his
own
persevering
efforts
and
his
conduct
as
a
man
and
son
he
might
well
exclaim
all
is
good
as
it
comes
from
the
hands
of
nature
but
the
conclusion
all
is
corrupted
in
the
hands
of
man
was
also
forced
upon
him
by
adverse
experience
it
was
not
with
himself
that
he
had
to
struggle
but
beyond
and
out
of
himself
with
the
conventional
world
from
whose
fetters
the
citizen
of
geneva
designed
to
set
us
free
and
as
from
the
circumstances
of
his
youth
the
struggle
he
had
to
undergo
had
often
been
difficult
and
painful
he
had
been
driven
back
upon
himself
too
violently
to
attain
a
thoroughly
serene
and
joyous
development
on
the
contrary
as
he
had
had
to
force
his
way
against
an
opposing
world
a
trait
of
bitterness
had
crept
into
his
character
which
he
afterwards
in
some
degree
fed
and
cherished
but
for
the
most
part
strove
against
and
conquered
klinger
his
works
as
far
as
i
am
able
to
recall
them
bespeak
a
strong
understanding
an
upright
mind
an
active
imagination
a
ready
perception
of
the
varieties
of
human
nature
and
a
characteristic
imitation
of
generic
differences
his
girls
and
boys
are
open
and
amiable
his
youths
ardent
his
men
plain
and
intelligent
the
personages
whom
he
paints
in
an
unfavorable
light
are
not
overdrawn
he
is
not
wanting
in
cheerfulness
and
good
humour
in
wit
and
happy
notions
allegories
and
symbols
are
at
his
command
he
can
entertain
and
please
us
and
the
enjoyment
would
be
still
purer
if
he
did
not
here
and
there
mar
both
for
himself
and
us
his
gay
pointed
jesting
by
a
touch
of
bitterness
yet
this
it
is
which
makes
him
what
he
is
the
modes
of
living
and
of
writing
become
as
varied
as
they
are
from
the
fact
that
every
one
wavers
theoretically
between
knowledge
and
error
and
practically
between
creation
and
destruction
klinger
should
be
classed
with
those
who
have
formed
themselves
for
the
world
out
of
themselves
out
of
their
own
souls
and
understandings
because
this
takes
place
in
and
among
a
greater
mass
and
because
among
themselves
they
use
with
power
and
effect
an
intelligible
language
flowing
out
of
universal
nature
and
popular
peculiarities
such
men
always
cherish
a
warm
hostility
to
all
forms
of
the
schools
especially
if
these
forms
separated
from
their
living
origin
have
degenerated
into
phrases
and
have
thus
lost
altogether
their
first
fresh
significance
such
men
almost
invariably
declare
war
against
new
opinions
views
and
systems
as
well
as
against
new
events
and
rising
men
of
importance
who
announce
or
produce
great
changes
they
are
however
not
so
much
to
blame
on
this
account
their
opposition
is
not
unnatural
when
they
see
all
that
which
they
are
indebted
to
for
their
own
existence
and
culture
menaced
with
ruin
and
in
great
danger
in
an
energetic
character
this
adherence
to
its
own
views
becomes
the
more
worthy
of
respect
when
it
has
been
maintained
throughout
a
life
in
the
world
and
in
business
and
when
a
mode
of
dealing
with
current
events
which
to
many
might
seem
rough
and
arbitrary
being
employed
at
the
right
time
has
led
surely
to
the
desired
end
this
was
the
case
with
klinger
without
pliability
which
was
never
the
virtue
of
the
born
citizen
of
the
empire
he
had
nevertheless
risen
steadily
and
honorably
to
posts
of
great
importance
had
managed
to
maintain
his
position
and
as
he
advanced
in
the
approbation
and
favor
of
his
highest
patrons
never
forgot
his
old
friends
or
the
path
he
had
left
behind
indeed
through
all
degrees
of
absence
and
separation
he
laboured
pertinaciously
to
preserve
the
most
complete
constancy
of
remembrance
and
it
certainly
deserves
to
be
remarked
that
in
his
coat
of
arms
though
adorned
by
the
badges
of
several
orders
he
like
another
willigis
did
not
disdain
to
perpetuate
the
tokens
of
his
early
life
lavater
it
was
not
long
before
i
formed
a
connection
with
lavater
passages
of
my
letter
of
a
pastor
to
his
colleagues
had
greatly
struck
him
for
much
of
it
agreed
perfectly
with
his
own
views
with
his
activity
our
correspondence
soon
became
lively
at
the
time
it
commenced
he
was
making
preparations
for
his
larger
work
on
physiognomy
the
introduction
to
which
had
already
been
laid
before
the
public
he
called
on
all
the
world
to
send
him
drawings
and
outlines
and
especially
representations
of
christ
and
although
i
could
do
as
good
as
nothing
in
this
way
he
nevertheless
insisted
on
my
sending
him
a
sketch
of
the
saviour
such
as
i
imagined
him
to
look
such
demands
for
the
impossible
gave
occasion
for
jests
of
many
kinds
for
i
had
no
other
way
of
defending
myself
against
his
peculiarities
but
by
bringing
forward
my
own
the
number
of
those
who
had
no
faith
in
physiognomy
or
at
least
regarded
it
as
uncertain
and
deceptive
was
very
great
and
several
who
had
a
liking
for
lavater
felt
a
desire
to
try
him
and
if
possible
to
play
him
a
trick
he
had
ordered
of
a
painter
in
frankfort
who
was
not
without
talent
the
profiles
of
several
well
known
persons
lavater
agent
ventured
upon
the
jest
of
sending
bahrdt
portrait
as
mine
which
soon
brought
back
a
merry
but
thundering
epistle
full
of
all
kinds
of
expletives
and
asseverations
that
this
was
not
my
picture
together
with
everything
that
on
such
an
occasion
lavater
would
naturally
have
to
say
in
confirmation
of
the
doctrine
of
physiognomy
my
true
likeness
which
was
sent
afterwards
he
allowed
to
pass
more
readily
but
even
here
the
opposition
into
which
he
fell
both
with
painters
and
with
individuals
showed
itself
at
once
the
former
could
never
work
for
him
faithfully
and
sufficiently
the
latter
whatever
excellences
they
might
have
came
always
too
far
short
of
the
idea
which
he
entertained
of
humanity
and
of
men
to
prevent
his
being
somewhat
repelled
by
the
special
characteristics
which
constitute
the
personality
of
the
individual
the
conception
of
humanity
which
had
been
formed
in
himself
and
in
his
own
humanity
was
so
completely
akin
to
the
living
image
of
christ
which
he
cherished
within
him
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
understand
how
a
man
could
live
and
breathe
without
at
the
same
time
being
a
christian
my
own
relation
to
the
christian
religion
lay
merely
in
my
sense
and
feeling
and
i
had
not
the
slightest
notion
of
that
physical
affinity
to
which
lavater
inclined
i
was
therefore
vexed
by
the
importunity
with
which
a
man
so
full
of
mind
and
heart
attacked
me
as
well
as
mendelssohn
and
others
maintaining
that
every
one
must
either
become
a
christian
with
him
a
christian
of
his
sort
or
else
that
one
must
bring
him
over
to
one
own
way
of
thinking
and
convince
him
of
precisely
that
in
which
one
had
found
peace
this
demand
so
directly
opposed
to
that
liberal
spirit
of
the
world
to
which
i
was
more
and
more
tending
did
not
have
the
best
effect
upon
me
all
unsuccessful
attempts
at
conversion
leave
him
who
has
been
selected
for
a
proselyte
stubborn
and
obdurate
and
this
was
especially
the
case
with
me
when
lavater
at
last
came
out
with
the
hard
dilemma
either
christian
or
atheist
upon
this
i
declared
that
if
he
would
not
leave
me
my
own
christianity
as
i
had
hitherto
cherished
it
i
could
readily
decide
for
atheism
particularly
as
i
saw
that
nobody
knew
precisely
what
either
meant
this
correspondence
vehement
as
it
was
did
not
disturb
the
good
terms
we
were
on
lavater
had
an
incredible
patience
pertinacity
and
endurance
he
was
confident
in
his
theory
and
with
his
determined
plan
to
propagate
his
convictions
in
the
world
he
was
willing
by
waiting
and
mildness
to
effect
what
he
could
not
accomplish
by
force
in
short
he
belonged
to
the
few
fortunate
men
whose
outward
vocation
perfectly
harmonizes
with
the
inner
one
and
whose
earliest
culture
coinciding
in
all
points
with
their
subsequent
pursuits
gives
a
natural
development
to
their
faculties
born
with
the
most
delicate
moral
susceptibilities
he
had
chosen
for
himself
the
clerical
profession
he
received
the
necessary
instruction
and
displayed
various
talents
but
without
inclining
to
that
degree
of
culture
which
is
called
learned
he
also
though
born
so
long
before
had
like
ourselves
been
caught
by
the
spirit
of
freedom
and
nature
which
belonged
to
the
time
and
which
whispered
flatteringly
in
every
ear
you
have
materials
and
solid
power
enough
within
yourself
without
much
outward
aid
all
depends
upon
your
developing
them
properly
the
obligation
of
a
clergyman
to
work
upon
men
morally
in
the
ordinary
sense
and
religiously
in
the
higher
sense
fully
coincided
with
his
mental
tendencies
his
marked
impulse
even
as
a
youth
was
to
impart
to
others
and
to
excite
in
them
his
own
just
and
pious
sentiments
and
his
favorite
occupation
was
the
observation
of
himself
and
of
his
the
former
was
facilitated
if
not
forced
upon
him
by
an
internal
sensitiveness
the
latter
by
a
keen
glance
which
could
quickly
read
the
outward
expression
still
he
was
not
born
for
contemplation
properly
speaking
the
gift
of
conveying
his
ideas
to
others
was
not
his
he
felt
himself
rather
with
all
his
powers
impelled
to
activity
to
action
and
i
have
never
known
any
one
who
was
more
unceasingly
active
than
lavater
but
because
our
inward
moral
nature
is
incorporated
in
outward
conditions
whether
we
belong
to
a
family
a
class
a
guild
a
city
or
a
state
he
was
obliged
in
his
desire
to
influence
others
to
come
into
contact
with
all
these
external
things
and
to
set
them
in
motion
hence
arose
many
a
collision
many
an
entanglement
especially
as
the
commonwealth
of
which
he
was
by
birth
a
member
enjoyed
under
the
most
precise
and
limits
an
admirable
hereditary
freedom
the
republican
from
his
boyhood
is
accustomed
himself
to
think
and
to
converse
on
public
affairs
in
the
first
bloom
of
his
life
the
youth
sees
the
period
approaching
when
as
a
member
of
a
free
corporation
he
will
have
a
vote
to
give
or
to
withhold
if
he
wishes
to
form
a
just
and
independent
judgment
he
must
before
all
things
convince
himself
of
the
worth
of
his
fellow
citizens
he
must
learn
to
know
them
he
must
inquire
into
their
sentiments
and
their
capacities
and
thus
in
aiming
to
read
others
he
becomes
intimate
with
his
own
bosom
lavater
under
such
circumstances
lavater
was
early
trained
and
this
business
of
life
seems
to
have
occupied
him
more
than
the
study
of
languages
and
the
analytic
criticism
which
is
not
only
allied
to
that
study
but
is
its
foundation
as
well
as
its
aim
in
later
years
when
his
attainments
and
his
views
had
reached
a
boundless
comprehensiveness
he
frequently
said
both
in
jest
and
in
seriousness
that
he
was
not
a
learned
man
it
is
precisely
to
this
want
of
deep
and
solid
learning
that
we
must
ascribe
the
fact
that
he
adhered
to
the
letter
of
the
bible
and
even
to
the
translation
and
found
in
it
nourishment
and
assistance
enough
for
all
that
he
sought
and
designed
very
soon
however
this
circle
of
action
in
a
corporation
or
guild
with
its
slow
movement
became
too
narrow
for
the
quick
nature
of
its
occupant
for
a
youth
to
be
upright
is
not
difficult
and
a
pure
conscience
revolts
at
the
wrong
of
which
it
is
still
innocent
the
oppressions
of
a
bailiff
lay
plain
before
the
eyes
of
the
citizens
but
it
was
by
no
means
easy
to
bring
them
to
justice
lavater
having
associated
a
friend
with
himself
anonymously
threatened
the
guilty
bailiff
the
matter
became
notorious
and
an
investigation
was
rendered
necessary
the
criminal
was
punished
but
the
prompters
of
this
act
of
justice
were
blamed
if
not
abused
in
a
well
ordered
state
even
the
right
must
not
be
brought
about
in
a
wrong
way
on
a
tour
which
lavater
now
made
through
germany
he
came
into
contact
with
educated
and
men
but
that
served
only
to
confirm
his
previous
thoughts
and
convictions
and
on
his
return
home
he
worked
from
his
own
resources
with
greater
freedom
than
ever
a
noble
and
good
man
he
was
conscious
within
himself
of
a
lofty
conception
of
humanity
and
whatever
in
experience
contradicts
such
a
conception
all
the
undeniable
defects
which
remove
every
one
from
perfection
he
reconciled
by
his
idea
of
the
divinity
which
in
the
midst
of
ages
came
down
into
human
nature
in
order
completely
to
restore
its
earlier
image
so
much
by
way
of
preface
on
the
tendencies
of
this
eminent
man
and
now
before
all
things
for
a
bright
picture
of
our
meeting
and
personal
intercourse
our
correspondence
had
not
long
been
carried
on
when
he
announced
to
me
and
to
others
that
in
a
voyage
up
the
rhine
which
he
was
about
to
undertake
he
would
soon
visit
frankfort
immediately
there
arose
a
great
excitement
in
our
world
all
were
curious
to
see
so
remarkable
a
person
many
hoped
to
profit
by
him
in
the
way
of
moral
and
religious
culture
the
sceptics
prepared
to
distinguish
themselves
by
grave
objections
the
conceited
felt
sure
of
entangling
and
confounding
him
by
arguments
in
which
they
had
strengthened
themselves
in
short
there
was
everything
there
was
all
the
favor
and
disfavor
which
awaits
a
distinguished
man
who
intends
to
meddle
with
this
motley
world
our
first
meeting
was
hearty
we
embraced
each
other
in
the
most
friendly
way
and
i
found
him
just
like
what
i
had
seen
in
many
portraits
of
him
i
saw
living
and
active
before
me
an
individual
quite
unique
and
distinguished
in
a
way
that
no
one
had
seen
before
or
will
see
again
lavater
on
the
contrary
at
the
first
moment
betrayed
by
some
peculiar
exclamations
that
i
was
not
what
he
had
expected
hereupon
i
assured
him
with
the
realism
which
had
been
born
in
me
and
which
i
had
cultivated
that
as
it
had
pleased
god
and
nature
to
make
me
in
that
fashion
we
must
rest
content
with
it
the
most
important
of
the
points
on
which
in
our
letters
we
had
been
far
from
agreeing
became
at
once
subjects
of
conversation
but
we
had
not
time
to
discuss
them
thoroughly
and
something
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
never
before
experienced
the
rest
of
us
whenever
we
wish
to
speak
of
affairs
of
the
soul
and
of
the
heart
were
wont
to
withdraw
from
the
crowd
and
even
from
all
society
because
in
the
many
modes
of
thinking
and
the
different
degrees
of
culture
among
men
it
is
difficult
to
be
on
an
understanding
even
with
a
few
but
lavater
was
of
a
wholly
different
turn
he
liked
to
extend
his
influence
as
far
as
possible
and
was
not
at
ease
except
in
a
crowd
for
the
instruction
and
entertainment
of
which
he
possessed
an
especial
talent
based
on
his
great
skill
in
physiognomy
he
had
a
wonderful
facility
of
discriminating
persons
and
minds
by
which
he
quickly
understood
the
mental
state
of
all
around
him
whenever
therefore
this
judgment
of
men
was
met
by
a
sincere
confession
a
inquiry
he
was
able
from
the
abundance
of
his
internal
and
external
experience
to
satisfy
every
one
with
an
appropriate
answer
the
deep
tenderness
of
his
look
the
marked
sweetness
of
his
lips
and
even
the
honest
swiss
dialect
which
was
heard
through
his
high
german
with
many
other
things
that
distinguished
him
immediately
placed
all
whom
he
addressed
quite
at
their
ease
even
the
slight
stoop
in
his
carriage
together
with
his
rather
hollow
chest
contributed
not
a
little
to
balance
in
the
eyes
of
the
remainder
of
the
company
the
weight
of
his
commanding
presence
towards
presumption
and
arrogance
he
knew
how
to
demean
himself
with
calmness
and
address
for
while
seeming
to
yield
he
would
suddenly
bring
forward
like
a
some
grand
view
of
which
his
opponent
would
never
have
thought
and
at
the
same
time
he
would
so
agreeably
moderate
the
light
which
flowed
from
it
that
such
men
felt
themselves
instructed
and
convinced
so
long
at
least
as
they
were
in
his
presence
perhaps
with
many
the
impression
continued
to
operate
long
afterwards
for
even
conceited
men
are
also
kindly
it
is
only
necessary
by
gentle
influences
to
soften
the
hard
shell
which
encloses
the
fruitful
kernel
what
caused
him
the
greatest
pain
was
the
presence
of
persons
whose
outward
ugliness
must
irrevocably
stamp
them
decided
enemies
of
his
theory
as
to
the
significance
of
forms
they
commonly
employed
a
considerable
amount
of
common
sense
and
other
gifts
and
talents
in
vehement
hostility
and
paltry
doubts
to
weaken
a
doctrine
which
appeared
offensive
to
their
for
it
was
not
easy
to
find
any
one
so
magnanimous
as
socrates
who
interpreted
his
exterior
in
favour
of
an
acquired
morality
to
lavater
the
hardness
the
obduracy
of
such
antagonists
was
horrible
and
his
opposition
was
not
free
from
passion
just
as
the
smelting
fire
must
attack
the
resisting
ore
as
something
troublesome
and
hostile
in
such
a
case
a
confidential
conversation
such
as
might
appeal
to
our
own
cases
and
experience
was
not
to
be
thought
of
however
i
was
much
instructed
by
observing
the
manner
in
which
he
treated
men
instructed
i
say
not
improved
by
it
for
my
position
was
wholly
different
from
his
he
that
works
morally
loses
none
of
his
efforts
for
there
comes
from
them
much
more
fruit
than
the
parable
of
the
sower
too
modestly
represents
but
he
whose
labours
are
artistic
fails
utterly
in
every
work
that
is
not
recognised
as
a
work
of
art
from
this
it
may
be
judged
how
impatient
my
dear
sympathizing
readers
were
accustomed
to
make
me
and
for
what
reasons
i
had
such
a
great
dislike
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
them
i
now
felt
but
too
vividly
the
difference
between
the
effectiveness
of
my
labors
and
those
of
lavater
his
prevailed
while
he
was
present
mine
when
i
was
absent
every
one
who
at
a
distance
was
dissatisfied
with
him
became
his
friend
when
they
met
and
every
one
who
judging
by
my
work
considered
me
amiable
found
himself
greatly
deceived
when
he
came
in
contract
with
a
man
of
coldness
and
reserve
merck
who
had
just
come
over
from
darmstadt
played
the
part
of
mephistopheles
especially
ridiculing
the
importunities
of
the
women
as
some
of
these
were
closely
examining
the
apartments
which
had
been
set
apart
for
the
prophet
and
above
all
his
the
wag
said
that
the
pious
souls
wished
to
see
where
they
had
laid
the
lord
nevertheless
he
as
well
as
the
others
was
forced
to
let
himself
be
exorcised
lips
who
accompanied
lavater
drew
his
profile
as
completely
and
successfully
as
he
did
those
of
other
men
both
important
and
unimportant
who
were
to
be
heaped
together
in
the
great
work
on
physiognomy
for
myself
lavater
society
was
highly
influential
and
instructive
for
his
pressing
incitements
to
action
set
my
calm
artistic
contemplative
nature
into
motion
not
indeed
to
any
advantage
at
the
moment
because
the
circumstances
did
but
increase
the
distraction
which
had
already
laid
hold
of
me
still
so
many
things
were
talked
about
between
us
as
to
give
rise
to
the
most
earnest
desire
on
my
part
to
prolong
the
discussion
accordingly
i
determined
to
accompany
him
if
he
went
to
ems
so
that
shut
up
in
the
carriage
and
separated
from
the
world
we
might
freely
go
over
those
subjects
which
lay
nearest
to
both
our
hearts
meanwhile
the
conversations
between
lavater
and
fraülein
yon
klettenberg
were
to
me
exceedingly
interesting
and
profitable
here
two
decided
christians
stood
in
contrast
to
each
other
and
it
was
quite
plain
how
the
same
belief
may
take
a
different
shape
according
to
the
sentiments
of
different
persons
in
those
tolerant
times
it
was
often
enough
repeated
that
every
man
had
his
own
religion
and
his
own
mode
of
worship
although
i
did
not
maintain
this
exactly
i
could
in
the
present
case
perceive
that
men
and
women
need
a
different
saviour
fraülein
von
klettenberg
looked
towards
hers
as
to
a
lover
to
whom
one
yields
oneself
without
reserve
concentrating
all
joy
and
hope
on
him
alone
and
without
doubt
or
hesitation
confiding
to
him
the
destiny
of
life
lavater
on
the
other
hand
treated
his
as
a
friend
to
be
imitated
lovingly
and
without
envy
whose
merits
he
recognised
and
valued
highly
and
whom
for
that
very
reason
he
strove
to
copy
and
even
to
equal
what
a
difference
between
these
two
tendencies
which
in
general
exhibit
the
spiritual
necessities
of
the
two
sexes
hence
we
may
perhaps
explain
the
fact
that
men
of
more
delicate
feeling
have
so
often
turned
to
the
mother
of
god
as
a
paragon
of
female
beauty
and
virtue
and
like
sannazaro
have
dedicated
to
her
their
lives
and
talents
occasionally
condescending
to
play
with
the
divine
infant
how
my
two
friends
stood
to
each
other
and
how
they
felt
towards
each
other
i
gathered
not
only
from
conversations
at
which
i
was
present
but
also
from
revelations
which
both
made
to
me
in
private
i
could
not
agree
entirely
with
either
for
my
christ
had
also
taken
a
form
of
his
own
in
accordance
with
my
views
because
they
would
not
allow
mine
to
pass
at
all
i
teased
them
with
all
sorts
of
paradoxes
and
exaggerations
and
when
they
got
impatient
left
them
with
a
jest
faith
and
knowledge
the
contest
between
knowledge
and
faith
was
not
yet
the
order
of
the
day
but
the
two
words
and
the
ideas
connected
with
them
occasionally
came
forward
and
the
true
haters
of
the
world
maintained
that
one
was
as
little
to
be
relied
on
as
the
other
accordingly
i
took
pleasure
in
declaring
in
favour
of
both
though
without
being
able
to
gain
the
assent
of
my
friends
in
faith
i
said
everything
depends
on
the
fact
of
believing
what
is
believed
is
perfectly
indifferent
faith
is
a
profound
sense
of
security
for
the
present
and
future
and
this
assurance
springs
from
confidence
in
an
immense
and
inscrutable
being
the
firmness
of
this
confidence
is
the
one
grand
point
but
what
we
think
of
this
being
depends
on
our
other
faculties
or
even
on
circumstances
and
is
wholly
indifferent
faith
is
a
holy
vessel
into
which
every
one
stands
ready
to
pour
his
feelings
his
understanding
his
imagination
as
perfectly
as
he
can
with
knowledge
it
is
directly
the
opposite
there
the
point
is
not
whether
we
know
but
what
we
know
how
much
we
know
and
how
well
we
know
it
hence
it
comes
that
men
may
dispute
about
knowledge
because
it
can
be
corrected
widened
and
contracted
knowledge
begins
with
the
particular
is
endless
and
formless
can
never
be
all
comprehended
or
at
least
but
dreamily
and
thus
remains
exactly
the
opposite
of
faith
half
truths
of
this
kind
and
the
errors
which
arise
from
them
may
when
poetically
exhibited
be
exciting
and
entertaining
but
in
life
they
disturb
and
confuse
conversation
for
that
reason
i
was
glad
to
leave
lavater
alone
with
all
those
who
wished
to
be
edified
by
him
and
through
him
a
deprivation
for
which
i
found
myself
fully
compensated
by
the
journey
we
made
together
to
ems
beautiful
summer
weather
attended
us
and
lavater
was
gay
and
most
amiable
for
though
of
a
religious
and
moral
turn
he
was
by
no
means
and
was
not
unmoved
when
by
the
events
of
life
those
around
him
were
excited
to
cheerfulness
and
gaiety
he
was
sympathizing
spirited
witty
and
liked
the
same
qualities
in
others
provided
that
they
were
kept
within
the
bounds
which
his
delicate
sense
of
propriety
prescribed
if
any
one
ventured
further
he
used
to
clap
him
on
the
shoulder
and
by
a
hearty
guet
would
call
the
rash
man
back
to
good
manners
this
journey
afforded
me
instruction
and
inspiration
of
many
kinds
which
however
contributed
to
a
knowledge
of
his
character
rather
than
to
the
government
and
culture
of
my
own
at
ems
i
saw
him
once
again
surrounded
by
society
of
every
sort
and
i
went
back
to
frankfort
because
my
little
affairs
were
in
such
a
state
that
i
could
scarcely
absent
myself
from
them
at
all
basedow
but
i
was
not
destined
to
be
restored
so
speedily
to
repose
basedow
now
came
in
to
attract
me
and
touch
me
on
another
side
a
more
decided
contrast
could
not
be
found
than
that
between
these
two
men
a
single
glance
at
basedow
showed
the
difference
lavater
features
displayed
themselves
with
openness
to
the
observer
but
those
of
basedow
were
crowded
together
and
as
it
were
drawn
inward
lavater
eye
beneath
a
very
wide
eyelid
was
clear
and
expressive
of
piety
basedow
was
deep
in
his
head
small
black
sharp
gleaming
from
under
bristly
brows
while
on
the
contrary
lavater
frontal
bone
was
edged
with
two
arches
of
the
softest
brown
hair
basedow
strong
rough
voice
quick
sharp
expressions
a
kind
of
sarcastic
laugh
a
rapid
change
of
subjects
in
conversation
with
other
peculiarities
were
all
the
opposite
of
the
qualities
and
manners
by
which
lavater
had
spoiled
us
basedow
was
also
much
sought
after
in
frankfort
and
his
great
talents
were
admired
but
he
was
not
the
man
either
to
edify
souls
or
to
lead
them
his
sole
office
was
to
give
a
better
cultivation
to
the
wide
field
he
had
marked
out
for
himself
so
that
humanity
might
afterwards
take
up
its
dwelling
in
it
with
greater
ease
and
accordance
with
nature
but
to
this
end
he
hastened
even
too
directly
i
could
not
altogether
acquiesce
in
his
plans
or
even
get
a
clear
understanding
of
his
views
i
was
of
course
pleased
with
his
desire
of
making
all
instruction
living
and
natural
his
wish
too
that
the
ancient
languages
should
be
practised
on
present
objects
appeared
to
me
laudable
and
i
gladly
acknowledged
all
that
in
his
project
tended
to
the
promotion
of
activity
and
a
fresher
view
of
the
world
but
i
was
displeased
that
the
illustrations
of
his
elementary
work
were
even
more
distracting
than
its
subjects
whereas
in
the
actual
world
possible
things
alone
stand
together
and
for
that
reason
in
spite
of
all
variety
and
apparent
confusion
the
world
has
still
a
regularity
in
all
its
parts
basedow
elementary
work
on
the
contrary
sunders
it
completely
inasmuch
as
things
which
in
the
world
never
are
combined
are
here
put
together
on
account
of
the
association
of
ideas
and
consequently
the
book
is
without
even
those
palpable
methodical
advantages
which
we
must
acknowledge
in
the
similar
work
of
amos
comenius
but
the
conduct
of
basedow
was
much
more
strange
and
difficult
to
comprehend
than
his
doctrine
the
purpose
of
his
journey
was
by
personal
influence
to
interest
the
public
in
his
philanthropic
enterprise
and
indeed
to
open
not
only
hearts
but
purses
he
had
the
power
of
speaking
grandly
and
convincingly
of
his
scheme
and
every
one
willingly
conceded
what
he
asserted
but
in
a
most
inexplicable
way
he
pained
the
feelings
of
the
very
men
whose
assistance
he
wished
to
gain
nay
he
outraged
them
unnecessarily
through
his
inability
to
keep
back
his
opinions
and
fancies
on
religious
subjects
in
this
respect
too
basedow
appeared
the
very
opposite
of
lavater
while
the
latter
received
the
bible
literally
and
with
its
whole
contents
as
being
word
for
word
in
force
and
applicable
even
at
the
present
day
the
former
had
the
most
unquiet
itching
to
renovate
everything
and
to
remodel
both
the
doctrines
and
the
ceremonies
of
the
church
in
conformity
with
some
odd
notions
of
his
own
most
imprudently
he
showed
no
mercy
to
those
conceptions
which
come
not
immediately
from
the
bible
but
from
its
interpretation
all
those
expressions
technical
philosophical
terms
or
sensible
figures
with
which
councils
and
fathers
of
the
church
had
sought
to
explain
the
inexpressible
or
to
confute
heretics
in
a
harsh
and
unwarrantable
way
and
before
all
alike
he
declared
himself
the
sworn
enemy
of
the
trinity
and
would
never
desist
from
arguing
against
this
universally
admitted
mystery
i
too
had
to
suffer
a
good
deal
from
this
kind
of
entertainment
in
private
conversation
and
was
compelled
again
and
again
to
listen
to
his
tirades
about
the
and
as
well
as
the
to
meet
them
all
i
had
recourse
to
the
weapons
of
paradox
and
soaring
even
above
the
flight
of
his
opinions
ventured
to
oppose
his
rash
assertions
with
something
rasher
of
my
own
this
gave
a
new
excitement
to
my
mind
and
as
basedow
was
much
more
extensively
read
and
had
more
skill
in
the
fencing
tricks
of
disputation
than
a
follower
of
nature
like
myself
i
had
always
to
exert
myself
the
more
the
more
important
were
the
points
which
were
discussed
between
us
such
a
splendid
opportunity
to
exercise
if
not
to
enlighten
my
mind
i
could
not
allow
to
pass
away
in
a
hurry
i
prevailed
on
my
father
and
friends
to
manage
my
most
pressing
affairs
and
now
set
off
again
from
frankfort
in
the
company
of
basedow
but
what
a
difference
did
i
feel
when
i
recalled
the
gentle
spirit
which
breathed
from
lavater
pure
himself
he
created
around
him
a
pure
circle
at
his
side
one
became
like
a
maiden
for
fear
of
presenting
before
him
anything
repulsive
basedow
on
the
contrary
being
altogether
absorbed
in
himself
could
not
pay
any
attention
to
his
external
appearance
his
ceaseless
smoking
of
wretched
tobacco
was
of
itself
extremely
disagreeable
especially
as
his
pipe
was
no
sooner
out
than
he
brought
forth
a
dirtily
prepared
kind
of
tinder
which
took
fire
quickly
but
had
a
most
horrid
stench
and
every
time
poisoned
the
air
insufferably
with
the
first
whiff
i
called
this
preparation
the
basedovian
smellfungus
and
declared
that
it
ought
to
be
introduced
into
natural
history
under
this
name
this
greatly
amused
him
and
to
my
disgust
he
minutely
explained
the
hated
preparation
taking
a
malicious
pleasure
in
my
aversion
from
it
it
was
one
of
the
deeply
rooted
disagreeable
peculiarities
of
this
admirably
gifted
man
that
he
was
fond
of
teasing
and
would
sting
the
most
dispassionate
persons
he
could
never
see
any
one
quiet
but
he
provoked
him
with
mocking
irony
in
a
hoarse
voice
or
put
him
to
confusion
by
an
unexpected
question
and
laughed
bitterly
when
he
had
gained
his
end
yet
he
was
pleased
when
the
object
of
his
jests
was
quick
enough
to
collect
himself
and
gave
him
a
retort
basedow
how
much
greater
was
now
my
longing
for
lavater
he
too
seemed
to
be
rejoiced
when
he
saw
me
again
and
confided
to
me
much
that
he
had
learned
especially
in
reference
to
the
various
characters
of
his
among
whom
he
had
already
succeeded
in
making
many
friends
and
disciples
for
my
part
i
found
here
several
old
acquaintances
and
in
those
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
many
years
i
began
to
notice
what
in
youth
long
remains
concealed
from
us
namely
that
men
grow
old
and
women
change
the
company
became
more
numerous
every
day
there
was
no
end
to
the
dancing
and
as
in
the
two
principal
people
came
into
pretty
close
contact
the
familiarity
led
to
many
a
practical
joke
once
i
disguised
myself
as
a
village
clergyman
while
an
intimate
friend
took
the
character
of
his
wife
by
our
excessive
and
troublesome
politeness
we
were
tolerably
amusing
to
the
elegant
society
and
so
put
every
one
into
good
humor
of
serenades
at
evening
midnight
and
morning
there
was
no
lack
and
we
juniors
enjoyed
but
little
sleep
to
make
up
for
these
dissipations
i
always
passed
a
part
of
the
night
with
basedow
he
never
went
to
bed
but
dictated
without
cessation
occasionally
he
cast
himself
on
the
couch
and
slumbered
while
his
amanuensis
sat
quietly
pen
in
hand
ready
to
continue
his
work
when
the
half
awakened
author
should
once
again
give
free
course
to
his
thoughts
all
this
took
place
in
a
close
confined
chamber
filled
with
the
fumes
of
tobacco
and
the
odious
tinder
as
often
as
i
was
disengaged
from
a
dance
i
hastened
up
to
basedow
who
was
ready
at
once
to
speak
and
dispute
on
any
question
and
when
after
a
time
i
hurried
again
to
the
before
i
had
closed
the
door
behind
me
he
would
resume
the
thread
of
his
essay
as
composedly
as
if
he
hat
been
engaged
with
nothing
else
we
also
made
together
many
excursions
into
the
neighborhood
visiting
the
châteaux
especially
those
of
noble
ladies
who
were
everywhere
more
inclined
than
the
men
to
receive
anything
that
made
a
pretence
to
intellect
and
talent
at
nassau
at
the
house
of
frau
von
stein
a
most
estimable
lady
who
enjoyed
universal
respect
we
found
a
large
company
frau
von
laroche
was
likewise
present
and
there
was
no
lack
of
young
ladies
and
children
here
lavater
was
doomed
to
be
put
to
many
a
physiognomical
temptation
which
consisted
mainly
in
our
seeking
to
palm
upon
him
the
accidents
of
cultivation
as
original
forms
but
his
eye
was
too
sure
to
be
deceived
i
too
was
called
on
as
much
as
ever
to
maintain
the
truth
of
the
sorrows
of
werther
and
to
name
the
residence
of
charlotte
a
desire
which
i
declined
to
gratify
not
in
the
politest
manner
on
the
other
hand
i
collected
the
children
around
me
in
order
to
tell
them
very
wonderful
stories
all
about
well
known
things
in
which
i
had
the
great
advantage
that
no
member
of
my
circle
of
hearers
could
ask
me
with
any
importunity
what
part
was
truth
and
what
fiction
basedow
and
lavater
basedow
affirmed
that
the
only
thing
necessary
was
a
better
education
of
youth
and
to
promote
this
end
he
called
upon
the
higher
and
wealthy
classes
for
considerable
contributions
but
hardly
had
his
reasoning
and
his
impassioned
eloquence
excited
not
to
say
won
to
his
purpose
the
sympathy
of
his
auditors
when
the
evil
spirit
came
upon
him
so
that
without
the
least
sense
of
where
he
was
he
broke
forth
into
the
strangest
discourses
which
in
his
own
opinion
were
highly
religious
but
according
to
the
convictions
of
those
around
him
highly
blasphemous
all
sought
a
remedy
for
this
evil
lavater
by
gentle
seriousness
i
by
jests
leading
off
from
the
subject
and
the
ladies
by
amusing
walks
but
harmony
could
not
be
restored
a
christian
conversation
such
as
had
been
expected
from
the
presence
of
lavater
a
discourse
on
education
such
as
had
been
anticipated
from
basedow
and
a
sentimental
one
for
which
it
was
thought
i
should
be
ready
all
were
at
once
disturbed
and
destroyed
on
our
return
home
lavater
reproached
him
but
i
punished
him
in
a
humorous
way
the
weather
was
warm
and
the
had
perhaps
contributed
to
the
dryness
of
palate
he
was
dying
for
a
glass
of
beer
and
seeing
a
tavern
at
a
distance
on
the
road
he
eagerly
ordered
the
coachman
to
stop
there
but
just
as
he
was
driving
up
to
the
door
i
called
out
to
him
loudly
and
imperiously
go
on
basedow
taken
by
surprise
could
hardly
get
the
contrary
command
out
of
his
husky
voice
i
urged
the
coachman
more
vehemently
and
he
obeyed
me
basedow
cursed
me
and
was
ready
to
fall
on
me
with
his
fists
but
i
replied
to
him
with
the
greatest
composure
father
be
quiet
you
ought
to
thank
me
luckily
you
did
see
the
it
was
two
triangles
put
together
across
each
other
now
you
commonly
get
mad
about
one
triangle
and
if
you
had
set
eyes
on
two
we
should
have
had
to
get
you
a
strait
jacket
this
joke
threw
him
into
a
fit
of
immoderate
laughter
in
the
intervals
of
which
he
scolded
and
cursed
me
while
lavater
exercised
his
patience
on
both
the
young
fool
and
the
old
one
when
in
the
middle
of
july
lavater
was
preparing
to
depart
basedow
thought
it
advantageous
to
join
him
while
i
had
become
so
accustomed
to
this
rare
society
that
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
give
it
up
we
had
a
delightful
journey
down
the
lahn
it
was
refreshing
alike
to
heart
and
senses
at
the
sight
of
an
old
ruined
castle
i
wrote
the
song
auf
dem
alten
thurme
high
on
the
ancient
turret
stands
in
lips
album
and
as
it
was
well
received
i
wrote
after
my
evil
habit
all
kinds
of
doggrel
rhymes
and
comicalities
on
the
succeeding
pages
in
order
to
destroy
the
impression
i
rejoiced
to
see
the
magnificent
rhine
once
more
and
was
delighted
with
the
astonishment
of
those
who
had
never
before
enjoyed
this
splendid
spectacle
we
landed
at
coblentz
wherever
we
went
the
crowd
was
very
great
and
each
of
the
three
excited
interest
and
curiosity
basedow
and
i
seemed
to
strive
which
could
behave
most
outrageously
lavater
conducted
himself
rationally
and
with
judgment
only
he
could
not
conceal
his
favorite
opinions
and
thus
with
the
best
designs
he
appeared
very
odd
to
all
men
of
mediocrity
i
have
preserved
the
memory
of
a
strange
dinner
at
a
hotel
in
coblentz
in
some
doggrel
rhymes
which
will
perhaps
stand
with
all
their
kindred
in
my
new
edition
i
sat
between
lavater
and
basedow
the
first
was
instructing
a
country
parson
on
the
mysteries
of
the
revelation
of
john
and
the
other
was
in
vain
endeavouring
to
prove
to
an
obstinate
dancing
master
that
baptism
was
an
obsolete
usage
not
calculated
for
our
times
as
we
were
going
on
to
cologne
i
wrote
in
an
album
as
though
to
emmaus
on
their
ride
storming
they
might
be
seen
the
prophets
sat
on
either
side
the
sat
between
the
brothers
jacobi
luckily
this
had
also
a
side
which
was
turned
towards
the
heavenly
and
which
was
now
to
be
moved
in
a
way
wholly
peculiar
while
in
ems
i
had
rejoiced
to
hear
that
in
cologne
we
should
find
the
brothers
jacobi
who
with
other
eminent
men
had
set
out
to
meet
and
show
attention
to
our
two
remarkable
travellers
on
my
part
i
hoped
for
forgiveness
from
them
for
sundry
little
improprieties
which
had
originated
in
the
great
love
of
mischief
that
herder
keen
humor
had
excited
in
us
the
letters
and
poems
in
which
gleim
and
george
jacobi
publicly
rejoiced
in
each
other
had
given
us
opportunity
for
all
sorts
of
sport
and
we
had
not
reflected
that
there
is
just
as
much
in
giving
pain
to
others
when
they
are
comfortable
as
in
showing
an
excess
of
kindness
to
oneself
or
to
one
friends
by
this
means
a
certain
dissension
had
arisen
between
the
upper
and
lower
rhine
of
so
slight
importance
however
that
mediation
was
easy
for
this
the
ladies
were
particularly
adapted
sophia
laroche
had
already
given
us
the
best
idea
of
the
noble
brothers
mademoiselle
fahlmer
who
had
come
to
frankfort
from
düsseldorf
and
who
was
intimate
with
their
circle
by
the
great
tenderness
of
her
sympathies
and
the
uncommon
cultivation
of
her
mind
furnished
an
evidence
of
the
worth
of
the
society
in
which
she
had
grown
up
she
gradually
put
us
to
shame
by
her
patience
with
our
harsh
upper
saxon
manner
and
taught
us
forbearance
by
letting
us
feel
that
we
ourselves
stood
in
need
of
it
the
of
the
younger
sister
of
the
jacobis
the
gaiety
of
the
wife
of
fritz
jacobi
turned
our
minds
and
eyes
more
and
more
to
these
regions
the
latter
was
qualified
to
captivate
me
entirely
possessed
of
a
correct
feeling
without
a
trace
of
sentimentality
and
with
a
lively
way
of
speaking
she
was
a
fine
netherlands
woman
who
without
any
expression
of
sensuality
by
her
robust
nature
called
to
mind
the
women
of
rubens
both
these
ladies
in
longer
and
shorter
visits
at
frankfort
had
formed
the
closest
alliance
with
my
sister
and
had
expanded
and
enlivened
the
severe
stiff
and
somewhat
loveless
nature
of
cornelia
thus
düsseldorf
and
pempelfort
had
interested
our
minds
and
hearts
even
in
frankfort
accordingly
our
first
meeting
in
cologne
was
at
once
frank
and
confidential
for
the
good
opinion
of
the
ladies
had
not
been
without
its
influence
at
home
i
was
not
now
treated
as
hitherto
on
the
journey
as
the
mere
misty
tail
of
the
two
great
comets
all
around
paid
me
particular
attention
and
showed
me
abundant
kindness
which
they
also
seemed
inclined
to
receive
from
me
in
return
i
was
weary
of
my
previous
follies
and
impertinences
behind
which
in
truth
i
only
hid
my
impatience
to
find
during
the
journey
so
little
care
taken
to
satisfy
my
heart
and
soul
hence
what
was
within
me
burst
out
like
a
torrent
and
this
is
perhaps
the
reason
why
i
recollect
so
little
of
individual
events
the
thoughts
we
have
had
the
pictures
we
have
seen
can
be
again
called
up
before
the
mind
and
the
imagination
but
the
heart
is
not
so
complaisant
it
will
not
repeat
its
agreeable
emotions
and
least
of
all
are
we
able
to
recall
moments
of
enthusiasm
they
come
upon
us
unprepared
and
we
yield
to
them
unconsciously
for
this
reason
others
who
observe
us
at
such
moments
have
a
better
and
clearer
insight
into
what
passes
within
us
than
we
ourselves
religious
conversations
i
had
hitherto
gently
declined
to
plain
questions
i
had
not
unfrequently
replied
with
harshness
because
they
seemed
to
me
too
narrow
in
comparison
with
what
i
sought
when
any
one
wished
to
force
upon
me
his
sentiments
and
opinions
of
my
compositions
but
especially
when
i
was
afflicted
with
the
demands
of
common
sense
and
people
told
me
decidedly
what
i
ought
to
have
done
or
left
undone
i
got
out
of
all
patience
and
the
conversation
broke
off
or
crumbled
to
pieces
so
that
no
one
went
away
with
a
particularly
good
opinion
of
me
it
would
have
been
much
more
natural
to
make
myself
gentle
and
friendly
but
my
feelings
would
not
be
schooled
they
needed
to
be
expanded
by
free
good
will
and
to
be
moved
to
a
surrender
by
sincere
sympathy
one
feeling
which
prevailed
greatly
with
me
and
could
never
find
an
expression
odd
enough
for
itself
was
a
sense
of
the
past
and
present
together
in
one
a
phenomenon
which
brought
something
spectral
into
the
present
it
is
expressed
in
many
of
my
smaller
and
larger
works
and
always
has
a
beneficial
influence
in
a
poem
though
whenever
it
began
to
mix
itself
up
with
actual
life
it
must
have
appeared
to
every
one
strange
inexplicable
perhaps
gloomy
cologne
was
the
place
where
antiquity
had
such
an
incalculable
effect
upon
me
the
ruins
of
the
cathedral
for
an
unfinished
work
is
like
one
destroyed
called
up
the
emotions
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
at
strasburg
artistic
considerations
were
out
of
the
question
too
much
and
too
little
was
given
me
and
there
was
no
one
who
could
help
me
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
what
was
performed
and
what
was
proposed
of
the
fact
and
the
plan
of
what
was
built
and
what
was
only
designed
as
our
industrious
persevering
friends
nowadays
are
ready
to
do
in
company
with
others
i
did
indeed
admire
its
wonderful
chapels
and
columns
but
when
alone
i
always
gloomily
lost
myself
in
this
thus
checked
in
its
creation
while
far
from
complete
here
too
was
a
great
idea
never
realized
it
would
seem
indeed
as
if
the
architecture
were
there
only
to
convince
us
that
by
many
men
in
a
series
of
years
nothing
can
be
accomplished
and
that
in
art
and
in
deeds
only
that
is
achieved
which
like
minerva
springs
and
armed
from
the
head
of
its
inventor
at
these
moments
which
oppressed
more
than
they
cheered
my
heart
i
little
thought
that
the
tenderest
and
fairest
emotion
was
in
store
for
me
near
at
hand
i
was
persuaded
to
visit
jabach
dwelling
and
here
all
that
i
had
been
wont
to
form
for
myself
in
my
mind
came
actually
and
sensibly
before
my
eyes
this
family
had
probably
long
ago
become
extinct
but
on
the
ground
floor
which
opened
upon
a
garden
we
found
everything
unchanged
a
pavement
of
brownish
red
tiles
of
a
rhomboidal
form
regularly
laid
carved
chairs
with
embroidered
seats
and
high
backs
metal
chandeliers
curiously
inlaid
on
heavy
feet
an
immense
with
its
appropriate
utensils
everything
in
harmony
with
those
early
times
and
in
the
whole
room
nothing
new
nothing
belonging
to
the
present
but
ourselves
but
what
more
than
all
heightened
and
completed
the
emotions
thus
strangely
excited
was
a
large
family
picture
over
the
there
sat
the
former
wealthy
inhabitant
of
this
abode
surrounded
by
his
wife
and
children
there
were
they
in
all
the
freshness
of
life
and
as
if
of
yesterday
or
rather
of
and
yet
all
of
them
had
passed
away
these
young
children
had
grown
old
and
but
for
this
clever
likeness
not
a
trace
of
them
would
have
remained
how
i
acted
how
i
demeaned
myself
when
overcome
by
these
impressions
i
can
not
say
the
lowest
depths
of
my
human
affections
and
poetic
sensibilities
were
laid
bare
in
the
boundless
stirring
of
my
heart
all
that
was
good
and
loving
in
my
soul
seemed
to
open
and
break
forth
in
that
moment
without
further
probation
or
debate
i
gained
for
life
the
affection
and
confidence
of
those
eminent
men
as
a
result
of
this
union
of
soul
and
intellect
in
which
all
that
was
living
in
each
came
forth
upon
his
lips
i
offered
to
recite
my
newest
and
most
favorite
ballads
könig
von
the
king
of
thule
and
war
ein
bube
frech
there
was
a
rascal
bold
enough
had
a
good
effect
and
i
brought
them
forth
with
more
feeling
as
my
poems
were
still
bound
to
my
heart
and
as
they
seldom
passed
my
lips
for
in
the
presence
of
persons
who
i
feared
could
not
sympathize
with
my
tender
sensibility
i
felt
restrained
and
frequently
in
the
midst
of
a
recitation
i
have
become
confused
and
could
not
get
right
again
how
often
for
that
reason
have
i
been
accused
of
wilfulness
and
of
a
strange
whimsical
disposition
although
poetic
composition
just
then
mainly
occupied
me
and
exactly
suited
my
temperament
i
was
still
no
stranger
to
reflection
on
all
kinds
of
subjects
and
jacobi
tendency
to
the
unfathomable
which
was
so
original
and
so
much
in
accordance
with
his
nature
was
most
welcome
and
agreeable
to
me
here
no
controversy
arose
neither
a
christian
one
as
with
lavater
nor
a
didactic
one
as
with
basedow
the
thoughts
which
jacobi
imparted
to
me
flowed
immediately
from
his
heart
how
profoundly
was
i
moved
when
in
unlimited
confidence
he
revealed
to
me
even
the
most
hidden
longings
of
his
soul
from
so
amazing
a
combination
of
mental
wants
passion
and
ideas
i
could
only
gather
presentiments
of
what
might
perhaps
afterwards
grow
more
clear
to
me
happily
i
had
already
prepared
if
not
fully
cultivated
myself
on
this
side
having
in
some
degree
appropriated
the
thoughts
and
mind
of
an
extraordinary
man
and
though
my
study
of
him
had
been
incomplete
and
hasty
i
was
yet
already
conscious
of
important
influences
derived
from
this
source
this
mind
which
had
worked
upon
me
thus
decisively
and
which
was
destined
to
affect
so
deeply
my
whole
mode
of
thinking
was
spinoza
after
looking
through
the
world
in
vain
to
find
a
means
of
development
for
my
strange
nature
i
at
last
fell
upon
the
ethics
of
this
philosopher
of
what
i
read
out
of
the
work
and
of
what
i
read
into
it
i
can
give
no
account
enough
that
i
found
in
it
a
sedative
for
my
passions
and
that
a
free
wide
view
over
the
sensible
and
moral
world
seemed
to
open
before
me
but
what
especially
riveted
me
to
him
was
the
utter
disinterestedness
which
shone
forth
in
his
every
sentence
that
wonderful
sentiment
he
who
truly
loves
god
must
not
desire
god
to
love
him
in
return
together
with
all
the
preliminary
propositions
on
which
it
rests
and
all
the
consequences
that
follow
from
it
filled
my
whole
mind
to
be
disinterested
in
everything
but
the
most
of
all
in
love
and
friendship
was
my
highest
desire
my
maxim
my
practice
so
that
that
subsequent
hasty
saying
of
mine
if
i
love
thee
what
is
that
to
thee
was
spoken
right
out
of
my
heart
moreover
it
must
not
be
forgotten
here
that
the
closest
unions
are
those
of
opposites
the
calmness
of
spinoza
was
in
striking
contrast
with
my
activity
his
mathematical
method
was
the
direct
opposite
of
my
poetic
humour
and
my
way
of
writing
and
that
very
precision
which
was
thought
to
moral
subjects
made
me
his
enthusiastic
disciple
his
most
decided
worshipper
mind
and
heart
understanding
and
sense
sought
each
other
with
an
eager
affinity
binding
together
the
most
different
natures
fritz
jacobi
at
this
time
however
all
within
was
fermenting
and
seething
in
the
first
action
and
reaction
fritz
jacobi
the
first
whom
i
suffered
to
look
into
the
chaos
and
whose
nature
was
also
toiling
in
its
own
extreme
depths
heartily
received
my
confidence
responded
to
it
and
endeavored
to
lead
me
to
his
own
opinions
he
too
felt
an
unspeakable
mental
want
he
too
did
not
wish
to
have
it
appeased
by
outward
aid
but
aimed
at
development
and
illumination
from
within
i
could
not
comprehend
what
he
communicated
to
me
of
the
state
of
his
mind
so
much
the
less
indeed
because
i
could
form
no
idea
as
to
my
own
still
as
he
was
far
in
advance
of
me
in
philosophical
thought
and
even
in
the
study
of
spinoza
he
endeavored
to
guide
and
enlighten
my
obscure
efforts
such
a
purely
intellectual
relationship
was
new
to
me
and
excited
a
passionate
longing
for
farther
communion
at
night
after
we
had
parted
and
retired
to
our
chambers
i
often
sought
him
again
with
the
moonlight
trembling
over
the
broad
rhine
we
stood
at
the
window
and
revelled
in
that
full
interchange
of
ideas
which
in
such
splendid
moments
of
confidence
swells
forth
so
abundantly
still
of
the
unspeakable
joy
of
those
moments
i
can
now
give
no
account
much
more
distinct
to
my
mind
is
an
excursion
to
the
of
bensberg
which
lying
on
the
right
shore
of
the
rhine
commanded
the
most
splendid
prospect
what
delighted
me
beyond
measure
was
the
decorations
of
the
walls
by
weenix
they
represented
a
large
open
hall
surrounded
by
columns
at
the
foot
of
these
as
if
forming
the
plinth
lay
all
the
animals
that
the
chase
can
furnish
skilfully
arranged
and
over
these
again
the
eye
ranged
over
a
wide
landscape
the
wonderful
artist
had
expended
his
whole
skill
in
giving
life
to
these
lifeless
creatures
in
the
delineation
of
their
widely
varying
coats
the
bristles
hair
or
feathers
with
the
antlers
and
claws
he
had
equalled
nature
while
in
the
effect
produced
he
had
excelled
her
when
we
had
admired
these
works
of
art
sufficiently
as
a
whole
we
were
led
to
reflect
on
the
handling
by
which
such
pictures
combining
so
much
spirit
and
mechanical
skill
were
produced
we
could
not
understand
how
they
could
be
created
by
the
hands
of
man
or
by
any
of
his
instruments
the
pencil
was
not
sufficient
peculiar
preparations
must
be
supposed
to
make
such
variety
possible
whether
we
came
close
to
them
or
withdrew
to
a
distance
our
astonishment
was
equal
the
cause
was
as
wonderful
as
the
effect
our
further
journey
up
the
rhine
was
happy
and
fortunate
the
widening
of
the
river
invites
the
mind
to
expand
itself
likewise
and
to
look
into
the
distance
we
arrived
at
düsseldorf
and
from
thence
came
to
pempelfort
a
most
delightful
and
beautiful
where
a
spacious
mansion
opening
upon
extensive
and
gardens
collected
together
a
thoughtful
and
refined
circle
the
members
of
the
family
were
numerous
and
strangers
who
found
abundant
enjoyment
in
so
rich
and
agreeable
a
neighbourhood
were
never
wanting
in
the
düsseldorf
gallery
my
predilection
for
the
flemish
school
found
plentiful
nourishment
there
were
whole
halls
filled
with
these
vigorous
sturdy
pictures
brilliant
with
a
fulness
of
nature
and
if
my
judgment
was
not
enlarged
my
store
of
knowledge
was
enriched
and
my
love
for
art
confirmed
the
beautiful
composure
contentment
and
firmness
which
marked
the
leading
character
of
this
family
circle
quickly
manifested
themselves
to
the
observant
eye
of
the
thoughtful
guest
who
could
not
fail
to
perceive
that
a
wide
sphere
of
influences
had
here
its
centre
the
activity
and
opulence
of
the
neighboring
cities
and
villages
contributed
not
a
little
to
enhance
this
feeling
of
inward
satisfaction
we
visited
elberfeld
and
were
delighted
with
the
busy
aspect
of
so
many
flourishing
manufactories
here
we
fell
in
again
with
our
friend
jung
commonly
known
as
stilling
who
had
gone
even
to
coblentz
to
meet
us
and
who
always
had
his
faith
in
god
and
his
truth
towards
men
as
his
most
precious
attendants
here
we
saw
him
in
his
own
circle
and
took
pleasure
in
the
confidence
reposed
in
him
by
his
fellow
citizens
who
though
occupied
with
earthly
gain
did
not
leave
the
heavenly
treasures
out
of
view
the
sight
of
this
industrious
region
was
satisfactory
because
its
prosperity
was
the
result
of
order
and
neatness
in
the
contemplation
of
these
things
we
passed
happy
days
when
i
returned
to
my
friend
jacobi
i
enjoyed
the
rapturous
feeling
springing
from
a
union
of
the
innermost
soul
we
were
both
inspired
by
the
liveliest
hope
of
an
influence
in
common
and
i
urgently
pressed
him
to
make
an
exhibition
in
some
striking
form
or
other
of
all
that
was
acting
and
moving
within
him
this
was
the
means
by
which
i
had
escaped
from
many
perplexities
and
i
hoped
that
it
would
relieve
him
also
he
did
not
object
but
undertook
the
task
with
zeal
and
how
much
that
is
good
and
beautiful
and
consolatory
has
he
accomplished
and
so
at
last
we
parted
with
the
happy
feeling
of
eternal
union
and
wholly
without
a
presentiment
that
our
labors
would
assume
the
opposite
directions
which
in
the
course
of
life
they
so
markedly
took
whatever
else
occurred
to
me
on
the
return
down
the
rhine
has
altogether
vanished
from
my
memory
partly
because
the
second
impressions
of
natural
objects
are
wont
in
my
mind
to
be
mingled
with
the
first
and
partly
because
with
my
thoughts
turned
inwardly
i
was
endeavouring
to
arrange
the
varied
experience
i
on
myself
had
gained
and
to
work
up
what
had
affected
me
of
one
important
result
as
it
impelled
me
to
creative
efforts
which
kept
me
occupied
for
a
long
time
i
will
now
speak
intended
drama
of
mahomet
with
my
lawless
disposition
with
a
life
and
action
so
aimless
and
purposeless
the
observation
could
not
long
escape
me
that
lavater
and
basedow
employed
intellectual
and
even
spiritual
means
for
earthly
ends
it
soon
struck
me
who
spent
my
talents
and
my
days
on
no
object
whatever
that
these
two
men
while
endeavoring
to
preach
their
doctrines
to
teach
and
to
convince
had
each
in
his
own
way
certain
views
in
the
background
the
advancement
of
which
was
to
them
of
great
consequence
lavater
went
to
work
gently
and
prudently
basedow
vehemently
rudely
and
even
awkwardly
but
both
were
so
convinced
of
the
excellence
of
their
favorite
schemes
and
undertakings
and
their
mode
of
prosecuting
them
that
so
far
all
were
compelled
to
look
upon
them
as
men
of
sincerity
and
to
love
and
to
honor
them
as
such
in
praise
of
lavater
especially
it
could
be
said
that
he
actually
had
higher
objects
and
if
he
acted
according
to
the
wisdom
of
this
world
it
was
in
the
belief
that
the
end
would
hallow
the
means
as
i
observed
them
both
nay
indeed
frankly
told
them
my
opinions
and
heard
theirs
in
return
the
thought
arose
in
me
that
every
man
is
called
upon
to
diffuse
whatever
there
is
of
divine
within
him
in
attempting
this
however
he
comes
in
contact
with
the
rough
world
and
in
order
to
act
upon
it
he
must
put
himself
on
the
same
level
thus
in
a
great
measure
he
compromises
his
high
advantages
and
finally
forfeits
them
altogether
the
heavenly
the
eternal
is
buried
in
a
body
of
earthly
designs
and
hurried
with
it
to
the
fate
of
the
transient
from
this
point
of
view
i
now
regarded
the
career
of
these
two
men
and
they
seemed
to
me
worthy
both
of
honor
and
of
compassion
for
i
thought
i
could
foresee
that
each
would
be
compelled
to
sacrifice
the
higher
to
the
lower
as
i
pursued
this
reflection
to
the
farthest
extremity
and
looked
beyond
the
limits
of
my
narrow
experience
for
similar
cases
in
history
the
plan
occurred
to
me
of
taking
the
life
of
mahomet
whom
i
had
never
been
able
to
think
an
impostor
for
a
dramatic
exhibition
of
those
courses
which
in
actual
life
i
was
strongly
convinced
invariably
lead
to
ruin
much
more
than
to
good
i
had
shortly
before
read
with
great
interest
and
studied
the
life
of
the
eastern
prophet
and
was
therefore
tolerably
prepared
when
the
thought
occurred
to
me
the
sketch
approached
on
the
whole
to
the
regular
form
to
which
i
was
again
inclining
although
i
still
used
in
moderation
the
liberty
gained
for
the
stage
and
arranged
time
and
place
according
to
my
own
pleasure
the
piece
began
with
mahomet
alone
under
the
open
sky
singing
a
hymn
in
it
he
adores
first
of
all
the
innumerable
stars
as
so
many
gods
but
as
the
friendly
star
gad
our
jupiter
rises
he
offers
to
him
as
the
king
of
the
stars
exclusive
adoration
not
long
after
the
moon
ascends
the
horizon
and
wins
the
eye
and
heart
of
the
worshipper
who
presently
refreshed
and
strengthened
by
the
dawning
sun
is
called
upon
for
new
praises
but
these
changing
phenomena
however
delightful
are
still
unsatisfactory
and
the
mind
feels
that
it
must
rise
yet
above
itself
it
mounts
therefore
to
god
the
only
eternal
infinite
to
whom
all
these
splendid
yet
limited
creatures
owe
their
existence
i
composed
this
hymn
with
great
delight
it
is
now
lost
but
might
easily
be
restored
for
the
purpose
of
a
cantata
and
would
commend
itself
to
the
musical
composer
by
the
variety
of
its
expression
it
would
however
be
necessary
to
imagine
it
sung
according
to
the
original
plan
by
the
conductor
of
a
caravan
with
his
family
and
tribe
and
thus
the
alternation
of
the
voices
and
the
strength
of
the
chorus
would
be
provided
for
intended
drama
of
mahomet
after
mahomet
has
thus
converted
himself
he
imparts
these
feelings
and
sentiments
to
his
friends
his
wife
and
ali
become
his
disciples
without
reserve
in
the
second
act
he
zealously
attempts
supported
by
the
still
more
ardent
ali
to
propagate
this
faith
in
the
tribe
assent
and
opposition
fallow
the
variety
of
character
the
contest
begins
the
strife
becomes
violent
and
mahomet
is
compelled
to
flee
in
the
third
act
he
defeats
his
enemies
and
making
his
religion
the
public
one
purifies
the
kaaba
from
idols
but
as
all
this
can
not
be
done
by
power
he
is
obliged
to
resort
to
cunning
what
in
his
character
is
earthly
increases
and
extends
itself
the
divine
retires
and
is
obscured
in
the
fourth
act
mahomet
pursues
his
conquests
his
doctrine
becomes
a
pretence
rather
than
an
end
all
conceivable
means
must
be
employed
and
barbarities
become
abundant
a
woman
whose
husband
has
been
put
to
death
by
mahomet
order
poisons
him
in
the
fifth
act
he
feels
that
he
is
poisoned
his
great
calmness
the
return
to
himself
and
to
a
higher
sense
make
him
worthy
of
admiration
he
purify
his
doctrine
establishes
his
kingdom
and
dies
such
was
the
sketch
of
a
work
which
long
occupied
my
mind
for
usually
i
was
obliged
to
have
the
materials
in
my
head
before
i
commenced
the
execution
i
meant
to
represent
the
power
which
genius
exercises
over
men
by
character
and
intellect
and
what
are
its
gains
and
losses
in
the
process
several
of
the
songs
to
be
introduced
in
the
drama
were
composed
beforehand
all
that
remains
of
them
however
is
what
stands
among
my
poems
under
the
title
mahomet
song
according
to
the
plan
this
was
to
be
sung
by
ali
in
honor
of
his
master
at
the
highest
point
of
his
success
just
before
the
changed
aspect
of
affairs
resulting
from
the
poison
i
recollect
also
the
outlines
of
several
scenes
but
the
explanation
of
them
here
would
lead
me
too
far
that
is
to
say
a
native
of
one
of
the
imperial
cities
the
title
of
the
poem
is
der
untreue
knabe
the
faithless
boy
and
in
the
first
line
of
it
as
published
in
göthe
collected
works
knabe
will
be
found
instead
of
bube
trans
fifteenth
book
from
these
manifold
dissipations
which
however
generally
gave
occasion
for
serious
and
even
religious
reflections
i
always
returned
to
my
noble
friend
fraülein
von
klettenberg
whose
presence
calmed
at
least
for
a
moment
my
stormy
and
undirected
impulses
and
passions
and
to
whom
next
to
my
sister
i
liked
best
to
communicate
designs
like
that
i
have
just
spoken
of
i
might
indeed
have
perceived
that
her
health
was
constantly
failing
but
i
concealed
it
from
myself
and
this
i
was
the
better
able
to
do
as
her
cheerfulness
increased
with
her
illness
she
used
to
sit
neatly
dressed
in
her
chair
at
the
window
and
kindly
listened
to
the
narratives
of
my
little
expeditions
as
well
as
to
what
i
read
aloud
to
her
often
too
i
made
sketches
in
order
to
make
her
understand
the
better
the
description
of
the
places
i
had
seen
one
evening
i
had
been
recalling
to
my
mind
many
different
images
when
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
she
and
all
around
her
appeared
before
me
as
if
transfigured
and
i
could
not
refrain
from
making
a
drawing
of
her
and
of
the
surrounding
objects
in
the
chamber
as
well
as
my
poor
skill
permitted
in
the
hands
of
a
skilful
artist
like
kersting
it
would
have
made
a
beautiful
picture
i
sent
it
to
a
fair
friend
at
a
distance
and
added
a
song
as
commentary
and
supplement
in
this
magic
glass
reflected
see
a
vision
mild
and
bless
by
the
wing
of
god
protected
see
our
friend
while
suffering
rest
mark
how
her
endeavours
bore
her
from
life
waves
to
realms
above
see
thine
image
stand
before
her
and
the
god
who
died
from
love
feel
what
i
amid
the
floating
of
that
heavenly
ether
knew
when
the
first
impression
noting
hastily
this
sketch
i
drew
though
in
these
stanzas
as
had
often
happened
before
i
expressed
myself
as
a
stranger
and
foreigner
in
short
as
a
heathen
she
did
not
take
offence
at
it
on
the
contrary
she
assured
me
that
in
so
doing
i
pleased
her
much
more
than
when
i
attempted
to
employ
the
christian
terminology
which
somehow
i
could
never
apply
correctly
indeed
it
had
become
a
standing
custom
with
me
whenever
i
read
to
her
missionary
intelligence
which
she
was
always
fond
of
listening
to
to
take
the
part
of
the
pagans
against
the
missionaries
and
to
praise
their
old
condition
as
preferable
to
their
new
one
still
she
was
ever
gentle
and
friendly
and
seemed
not
to
have
the
least
fear
about
me
or
my
salvation
the
moravians
my
gradual
alienation
from
her
creed
arose
from
the
fact
that
i
had
laid
hold
of
it
at
first
with
too
great
zeal
with
passionate
love
ever
since
i
became
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
moravians
my
inclination
to
this
society
which
had
united
under
the
victorious
banners
of
christ
had
constantly
increased
it
is
exactly
in
the
moment
of
its
earliest
formation
that
a
positive
religion
possesses
its
greatest
attraction
on
that
account
it
is
delightful
to
go
back
to
the
time
of
the
apostles
where
all
stands
forth
as
fresh
and
immediately
spiritual
and
thus
it
was
that
the
moravian
doctrine
acquired
something
of
a
magical
charm
by
appearing
to
continue
or
rather
to
perpetuate
the
condition
of
those
first
times
it
connected
its
origin
with
them
when
it
seemed
to
perish
it
still
wound
its
way
through
the
world
although
by
unnoticed
tendrils
at
last
one
little
germ
took
root
beneath
the
protection
of
a
pious
and
eminent
man
and
so
from
an
unnoticed
and
apparently
accidental
beginning
expanded
once
more
over
the
wide
world
in
this
society
the
most
important
point
was
the
inseparable
combination
of
the
religious
and
civil
constitution
by
which
the
teacher
was
at
the
same
time
the
ruler
and
the
father
the
judge
what
was
still
more
distinctive
of
their
fraternity
was
that
the
religious
head
to
whom
unlimited
faith
was
yielded
in
spiritual
things
was
also
intrusted
with
the
guidance
of
temporal
affairs
and
his
counsels
whether
for
the
government
of
the
whole
body
or
for
the
guidance
of
individuals
if
confirmed
by
the
issue
of
the
lot
were
implicitly
followed
its
peace
and
harmony
to
which
at
least
outward
appearances
testified
was
most
alluring
while
on
the
other
hand
the
missionary
vocation
seemed
to
call
forth
and
to
give
employment
to
all
man
active
powers
the
excellent
persons
whose
acquaintance
i
made
at
marienborn
which
i
had
visited
in
the
company
of
councillor
moritz
the
agent
of
count
von
isenburg
had
gained
my
unqualified
esteem
and
it
only
depended
on
themselves
to
make
me
their
own
i
studied
their
history
and
their
doctrine
and
the
origin
and
growth
of
their
society
so
as
to
be
able
to
give
an
account
of
it
and
to
talk
about
it
to
all
who
might
feel
interested
in
it
nevertheless
the
conviction
was
soon
forced
upon
me
that
with
the
brethren
i
did
not
pass
for
a
christian
any
more
than
i
did
with
fraülein
von
klettenberg
at
first
this
disturbed
me
but
afterwards
my
inclination
to
them
became
somewhat
cooler
however
i
could
not
for
a
long
time
discover
the
precise
ground
of
difference
although
it
was
obvious
enough
until
at
last
it
was
forced
upon
me
more
by
accident
than
by
reflection
what
separated
me
from
this
brotherhood
as
well
as
from
other
good
christian
souls
was
the
very
point
on
which
the
church
has
more
than
once
fallen
into
dissension
on
the
one
hand
it
was
maintained
that
by
the
fall
human
nature
had
been
so
corrupted
to
its
innermost
core
that
not
the
least
good
could
be
found
in
it
and
that
therefore
man
must
renounce
all
trust
in
his
own
powers
and
look
to
grace
and
its
operations
for
everything
the
other
party
while
it
admitted
the
hereditary
imperfections
of
man
nevertheless
ascribed
to
nature
a
certain
germ
of
good
within
which
animated
by
divine
grace
was
capable
of
growing
up
to
a
joyous
tree
of
spiritual
happiness
by
this
latter
conviction
i
was
unconsciously
penetrated
to
my
inmost
soul
even
while
with
tongue
and
pen
i
maintained
the
opposite
side
but
i
had
hitherto
gone
on
with
such
ideas
that
i
had
never
once
clearly
stated
the
dilemma
to
myself
from
this
dream
i
was
unexpectedly
roused
one
day
when
in
a
religious
conversation
having
distinctly
advanced
opinions
to
my
mind
most
innocent
i
had
in
return
to
undergo
a
severe
lecture
the
very
thought
of
such
a
thing
it
was
maintained
was
genuine
pelagianism
a
pernicious
doctrine
which
was
again
appearing
to
the
great
injury
of
modern
times
i
was
astonished
and
even
terrified
i
went
back
to
church
history
studied
the
doctrine
and
fate
of
pelagius
more
closely
and
now
saw
clearly
how
these
two
irreconcilable
opinions
had
fluctuated
in
favour
through
whole
centuries
and
had
been
embraced
and
acknowledged
by
different
men
according
as
they
were
of
a
more
active
or
of
a
more
passive
nature
the
course
of
past
years
had
constantly
led
me
more
and
more
to
the
exercise
of
my
own
powers
a
restless
activity
was
at
work
within
me
with
the
best
desire
for
moral
development
the
world
without
demanded
that
this
activity
should
be
regulated
and
employed
for
the
advantage
of
others
and
this
great
demand
i
felt
called
upon
in
my
own
case
to
meet
on
all
sides
i
had
been
directed
to
nature
and
she
had
appeared
to
me
in
her
whole
magnificence
i
had
been
acquainted
with
many
good
and
true
men
who
were
toiling
to
do
their
duty
and
for
the
sake
of
duty
to
renounce
them
nay
to
renounce
myself
seemed
impossible
the
gulf
which
separated
me
from
the
doctrine
of
man
total
depravity
now
became
plain
to
me
nothing
therefore
remained
to
me
but
to
part
from
this
society
and
as
my
love
of
the
holy
scriptures
as
well
as
of
the
founder
of
christianity
and
its
early
professors
could
not
be
taken
from
me
i
formed
a
christianity
for
my
private
use
and
sought
to
establish
and
build
it
up
by
an
attentive
study
of
history
and
a
careful
observation
of
those
who
were
favourable
to
my
opinion
the
wandering
jew
as
everything
which
i
once
warmly
embraced
immediately
put
on
a
poetic
form
i
now
took
up
the
strange
idea
of
treating
epically
the
history
of
the
wandering
jew
which
popular
books
had
long
since
impressed
upon
my
mind
my
design
was
to
bring
out
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
such
prominent
points
of
the
history
of
religion
and
the
church
as
i
should
find
convenient
i
will
now
explain
the
way
in
which
i
treated
this
fable
and
what
meaning
i
gave
to
it
in
jerusalem
according
to
the
legend
there
was
a
shoemaker
of
the
name
of
ahasuerus
for
this
character
my
dresden
shoemaker
was
to
supply
the
main
features
i
had
furnished
him
with
the
spirit
and
humor
of
a
craftsman
of
the
school
of
hans
sachs
and
ennobled
him
by
an
inclination
to
christ
accordingly
as
in
his
open
workshop
he
liked
to
talk
with
the
jested
with
them
and
after
the
socratic
fashion
touched
up
every
one
in
his
own
way
the
neighbors
and
others
of
the
people
took
pleasure
in
lingering
at
his
booth
even
pharisees
and
sadducees
spoke
to
him
and
the
saviour
himself
and
his
disciples
would
often
stop
at
his
door
the
shoemaker
whose
thoughts
were
directed
solely
towards
the
world
i
painted
as
feeling
nevertheless
a
special
affection
for
our
lord
which
for
the
most
part
evinced
itself
by
a
desire
to
bring
this
lofty
being
whose
mind
he
did
not
comprehend
over
to
his
own
way
of
thinking
and
acting
accordingly
in
a
modest
manner
he
recommends
christ
to
abandon
his
contemplative
life
and
to
leave
off
going
about
the
country
with
such
idlers
and
drawing
the
people
away
from
their
labor
into
the
wilderness
a
multitude
he
said
was
always
ready
for
excitement
and
nothing
good
could
come
of
it
on
the
other
hand
the
lord
endeavoured
by
parables
to
instruct
him
in
his
higher
views
and
aims
but
these
were
all
thrown
away
on
his
mere
intellect
thus
as
christ
becomes
more
and
more
an
important
character
and
finally
a
public
person
the
friendly
workman
pronounces
his
opinion
still
more
sharply
and
vehemently
maintaining
that
nothing
but
disorder
and
tumult
could
follow
from
such
proceedings
and
that
christ
would
be
at
last
compelled
to
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
party
though
that
could
not
possibly
be
his
design
finally
when
things
had
taken
the
course
which
history
narrates
and
christ
had
been
seized
and
condemned
ahasuerus
gives
full
vent
to
his
indignation
when
judas
who
undesignedly
had
betrayed
his
lord
in
his
despair
enters
the
workshop
and
with
lamentations
relates
how
his
plans
had
been
crossed
he
had
been
he
said
as
well
as
the
shrewdest
of
the
other
disciples
firmly
convinced
that
christ
would
declare
himself
regent
and
head
of
the
nation
his
purpose
was
only
by
this
violence
to
compel
the
lord
whose
hesitation
had
hitherto
been
invincible
to
hasten
the
declaration
accordingly
he
had
incited
the
priesthood
to
an
act
which
previously
they
had
not
courage
to
do
the
disciples
on
their
side
were
not
without
arms
and
probably
all
would
have
turned
out
well
if
the
lord
had
not
given
himself
up
and
left
them
in
the
most
forlorn
state
ahasuerus
whom
this
narrative
in
no
ways
tends
to
propitiate
only
exasperates
the
agony
of
the
poor
who
rushes
out
and
goes
and
hangs
himself
the
wandering
jew
as
jesus
is
led
past
the
workshop
of
the
shoemaker
on
his
way
to
execution
the
scene
of
the
legend
occurs
the
sufferer
faints
under
the
burden
of
the
cross
and
simon
of
cyrene
is
compelled
to
carry
it
upon
this
ahasuerus
comes
forward
and
sustains
the
part
of
those
harsh
people
who
when
they
see
a
man
involved
in
misfortune
through
his
own
fault
feel
no
pity
but
struck
by
an
untimely
sense
of
justice
make
the
matter
worse
by
their
reproaches
as
he
comes
out
he
repeats
all
his
former
warnings
changing
them
into
vehement
accusations
which
his
attachment
to
the
sufferer
seems
to
justify
the
saviour
does
not
answer
but
at
the
instant
the
loving
veronica
covers
his
face
with
the
napkin
on
which
as
she
removes
it
and
raises
it
aloft
ahasuerus
sees
depicted
the
features
of
the
lord
not
indeed
as
those
of
the
sufferer
of
the
moment
but
as
of
one
transfigured
and
radiant
with
celestial
life
amazed
by
this
phenomenon
he
turns
away
his
eyes
and
hears
the
words
over
the
earth
shalt
thou
wander
till
thou
shalt
once
more
see
me
in
this
form
overwhelmed
at
the
sentence
it
is
not
till
after
some
time
that
the
artisan
comes
to
himself
he
then
finds
that
every
one
has
gone
to
the
place
of
execution
and
that
the
streets
of
jerusalem
are
empty
disquiet
and
curiosity
drive
him
forth
and
he
begins
his
wandering
i
shall
perhaps
speak
elsewhere
of
all
this
and
of
the
incident
by
which
the
poem
was
ended
indeed
but
not
finished
the
beginning
some
detached
passages
and
the
conclusion
were
written
but
i
never
completed
the
work
i
lacked
time
for
the
studies
necessary
to
give
it
the
finish
and
bearing
that
i
wished
the
few
sheets
which
i
did
write
were
the
more
willingly
left
to
repose
in
obscurity
as
a
new
and
necessary
epoch
was
now
formed
in
my
mental
character
by
the
publication
of
werther
the
common
fate
of
man
which
all
of
us
have
to
bear
must
fall
most
heavily
on
those
whose
intellectual
powers
expand
very
early
for
a
time
we
may
grow
up
under
the
protection
of
parents
and
relatives
we
may
lean
for
a
while
upon
our
brothers
and
sisters
and
friends
be
supported
by
acquaintances
and
made
happy
by
those
we
love
but
in
the
end
man
is
always
driven
back
upon
himself
and
it
seems
as
if
the
divinity
had
taken
a
position
towards
men
so
as
not
always
to
respond
to
their
reverence
trust
and
love
at
least
not
in
the
precise
moment
of
need
early
enough
and
by
many
a
hard
lesson
had
i
learned
that
at
the
most
urgent
crises
the
call
to
us
is
physician
heal
thyself
and
how
frequently
had
i
been
compelled
to
sigh
out
in
pain
i
tread
the
alone
so
now
while
i
was
looking
about
for
the
means
of
establishing
my
independence
i
felt
that
the
surest
basis
on
which
to
build
was
my
own
creative
talents
for
many
years
i
had
never
known
it
to
fail
me
for
a
moment
what
waking
i
had
seen
by
day
often
shaped
itself
into
regular
dreams
at
night
and
when
i
opened
my
eyes
there
appeared
to
me
either
a
wonderful
new
whole
or
a
part
of
one
already
commenced
usually
my
time
for
wilting
was
early
in
the
morning
but
still
in
the
evening
or
even
late
at
night
when
wine
and
social
intercourse
had
raised
my
spirits
i
was
ready
for
any
topic
that
might
be
suggested
only
let
a
subject
of
some
character
be
offered
and
i
was
at
once
prepared
and
ready
while
then
i
reflected
upon
this
natural
gift
and
found
that
it
belonged
to
me
as
my
own
and
could
neither
be
favoured
nor
hindered
by
any
external
matters
i
easily
in
thought
built
my
whole
existence
upon
it
this
conception
soon
assumed
a
distinct
form
the
old
mythological
image
of
prometheus
occurred
to
me
who
separated
from
the
gods
peopled
a
world
from
his
own
workshop
i
clearly
felt
that
a
creation
of
importance
could
be
produced
only
when
its
author
isolated
himself
my
productions
which
had
met
with
so
much
applause
were
children
of
solitude
and
since
i
had
stood
in
a
wider
relation
to
the
world
i
had
not
been
wanting
in
the
power
or
the
pleasure
of
invention
but
the
execution
halted
because
i
had
neither
in
prose
nor
in
verse
a
style
properly
my
own
and
consequently
with
every
new
work
had
always
to
begin
at
the
beginning
and
try
experiments
as
in
this
i
had
to
decline
and
even
to
exclude
the
aid
of
men
so
after
the
fashion
of
prometheus
i
separated
myself
from
the
gods
also
and
the
more
naturally
as
with
my
character
and
mode
of
thinking
one
tendency
always
swallowed
up
and
repelled
all
others
prometheus
the
fable
of
prometheus
became
living
in
me
the
old
titan
web
i
cut
up
according
to
my
own
measurements
and
without
further
reflection
began
to
write
a
piece
in
which
was
painted
the
difficulty
prometheus
was
placed
in
with
respect
to
jupiter
and
the
later
gods
in
consequence
of
his
making
men
with
his
own
hand
giving
them
life
by
the
aid
of
minerva
and
founding
a
third
dynasty
and
in
fact
the
reigning
gods
had
good
cause
to
feel
aggrieved
since
they
might
now
appear
in
the
light
of
wrongful
intruders
between
the
titans
and
men
to
this
singular
composition
belongs
as
a
monologue
that
poem
which
has
become
remarkable
in
german
literature
by
having
called
forth
a
declaration
from
lessing
against
jacobi
on
certain
weighty
matters
of
thought
and
feeling
it
thus
served
as
the
match
to
an
explosion
which
revealed
and
brought
into
discussion
the
most
secret
relations
of
men
of
worth
relations
of
which
they
perhaps
were
not
themselves
conscious
and
which
were
slumbering
in
a
society
otherwise
most
enlightened
the
schism
was
so
violent
that
with
the
concurrence
of
further
incidents
it
caused
us
the
loss
of
one
of
our
most
valuable
men
namely
mendelssohn
although
philosophical
and
even
religions
considerations
may
be
and
before
now
have
been
attached
to
this
subject
still
it
belongs
peculiarly
to
poetry
the
titans
are
the
foil
of
polytheism
as
the
devil
may
be
considered
the
foil
of
monotheism
though
like
the
only
god
to
whom
he
stands
in
contrast
he
is
not
a
poetic
figure
the
satan
of
milton
though
boldly
enough
drawn
still
remains
in
the
disadvantageous
light
of
a
subordinate
existence
attempting
to
destroy
the
splendid
creation
of
a
higher
being
prometheus
on
the
contrary
has
this
advantage
that
even
in
spite
of
superior
beings
he
is
able
to
act
and
to
create
it
is
also
a
beautiful
thought
and
well
suited
to
poetry
to
represent
men
as
created
not
by
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
world
but
by
an
intermediate
agent
who
however
as
a
descendant
of
the
most
ancient
dynasty
is
of
worth
and
importance
enough
for
such
an
office
thus
and
indeed
under
every
aspect
the
grecian
mythology
is
an
inexhaustible
mine
of
divine
and
human
symbols
nevertheless
the
titanic
gigantic
character
afforded
no
suitable
material
for
my
poetic
art
it
better
suited
me
to
represent
that
peaceful
plastic
and
always
patient
opposition
which
recognising
the
superior
power
still
presumes
to
claim
equality
and
yet
the
bolder
members
of
the
race
tantalus
ixion
sisyphus
were
also
my
saints
admitted
to
the
society
of
the
gods
they
would
not
deport
themselves
submissively
enough
but
by
their
haughty
bearing
as
guests
provoked
the
anger
of
their
host
and
patron
and
drew
upon
themselves
a
sorrowful
banishment
i
pitied
them
their
condition
had
already
been
set
forth
by
the
ancients
as
truly
tragic
and
when
i
introduced
them
in
the
background
of
my
i
was
indebted
to
them
for
a
part
of
the
effect
which
that
piece
had
the
good
fortune
to
produce
at
this
period
i
usually
combined
the
art
of
design
with
poetical
composition
i
drew
the
portraits
of
my
friends
in
profile
on
grey
paper
in
white
and
black
chalk
whenever
i
dictated
or
listened
to
reading
i
sketched
the
positions
of
the
writer
and
reader
with
the
surrounding
objects
the
resemblance
could
not
be
denied
and
the
drawings
were
well
received
dilettanti
always
have
this
advantage
because
they
give
their
labor
for
nothing
but
feeling
the
insufficiency
of
this
copying
i
betook
myself
once
more
to
language
and
rhythm
which
were
much
more
at
my
command
how
briskly
how
joyously
and
eagerly
i
went
to
work
with
them
will
appear
from
the
many
poems
which
enthusiastically
proclaiming
the
art
of
nature
and
the
nature
of
art
infused
at
the
moment
of
their
production
new
spirit
into
me
as
well
as
into
my
friends
at
this
epoch
and
in
the
midst
of
these
occupations
i
was
sitting
one
evening
with
a
struggling
light
in
my
chamber
to
which
at
least
the
air
of
an
artist
studio
was
thus
imparted
while
the
walls
stuck
over
and
covered
with
works
gave
the
impression
of
great
industry
when
there
entered
a
slender
man
whom
at
first
in
the
twilight
i
took
for
fritz
jacobi
but
soon
discovering
my
mistake
greeted
as
a
stranger
in
his
free
and
agreeable
bearing
a
certain
military
air
was
perceptible
he
announced
himself
by
the
name
of
von
knebel
and
from
a
brief
introduction
i
gathered
that
he
was
in
the
prussian
service
and
that
during
a
long
residence
at
berlin
and
potsdam
he
had
actively
cultivated
an
acquaintance
with
the
literary
men
of
those
places
and
with
german
literature
in
general
he
had
attached
himself
particularly
to
ramler
and
had
adopted
his
mode
of
reciting
poems
he
was
also
familiar
with
all
that
götz
had
written
who
at
that
time
had
not
as
yet
made
a
name
among
the
germans
through
his
exertions
the
isle
of
maidens
of
this
poet
had
been
printed
at
potsdam
and
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
king
who
was
said
to
have
expressed
a
favorable
opinion
of
it
state
of
weimar
we
had
scarcely
talked
over
these
subjects
of
general
interest
in
german
literature
before
i
learned
much
to
my
satisfaction
that
he
was
at
present
stationed
in
weimar
and
was
appointed
the
companion
of
prince
constantin
of
matters
there
i
had
already
heard
much
that
was
favorable
for
several
strangers
who
had
come
from
weimar
assured
us
that
the
duchess
amalia
had
gathered
round
her
the
best
men
to
assist
in
the
education
of
the
princes
her
sons
that
the
academy
of
jena
through
its
admirable
teachers
had
also
contributed
its
part
to
this
excellent
purpose
and
that
the
arts
were
not
only
protected
by
this
princess
but
were
practised
by
her
with
great
diligence
and
zeal
we
also
heard
that
wieland
was
in
especial
favor
the
too
which
united
the
labors
of
so
many
scholars
in
other
places
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
fame
of
the
city
in
which
it
was
published
there
also
was
one
of
the
best
theatres
in
germany
which
was
made
famous
by
its
actors
as
well
as
by
the
authors
who
wrote
for
it
these
noble
institutions
and
plans
seemed
however
to
have
received
a
sudden
check
and
to
be
threatened
with
a
long
interruption
in
consequence
of
the
terrible
conflagration
of
the
castle
which
took
place
in
the
may
of
that
year
but
the
confidence
in
the
hereditary
prince
was
so
great
that
every
one
was
convinced
not
only
that
the
damage
would
be
repaired
but
that
in
spite
of
it
every
other
hope
would
be
fully
accomplished
as
i
inquired
after
these
persons
and
things
as
if
i
were
an
old
acquaintance
and
expressed
a
wish
to
become
more
intimately
acquainted
with
them
my
visitor
replied
in
the
most
friendly
manner
possible
that
nothing
was
easier
since
the
hereditary
prince
with
his
brother
the
prince
constantin
had
just
arrived
in
frankfort
and
desired
to
see
and
know
me
i
at
once
expressed
the
greatest
willingness
to
wait
upon
them
and
my
new
friend
told
me
that
i
must
not
delay
as
their
stay
would
not
be
long
in
order
to
equip
myself
for
the
visit
i
took
von
knebel
to
my
father
and
mother
who
were
surprised
at
his
arrival
and
the
message
he
bore
and
conversed
with
him
with
great
satisfaction
i
then
proceeded
with
him
to
the
young
princes
who
received
me
in
a
very
easy
and
friendly
manner
count
görtz
also
the
tutor
of
the
hereditary
prince
appeared
not
displeased
to
see
me
though
there
was
no
lack
of
literary
subjects
for
our
conversation
accident
furnished
the
best
possible
introduction
to
it
and
rendered
it
at
once
important
and
profitable
möser
patriotic
fantasies
that
is
to
say
the
first
part
of
them
were
lying
on
the
table
fresh
from
the
binder
with
the
leaves
uncut
as
i
was
familiar
with
them
while
the
rest
were
scarcely
acquainted
with
them
i
had
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
give
a
complete
account
of
the
work
and
had
here
a
favorable
opportunity
for
speaking
with
a
young
prince
who
was
sincerely
desirous
and
also
firmly
determined
to
make
use
of
his
station
to
do
all
the
good
in
his
power
möser
book
both
in
its
contents
and
its
tone
could
not
but
be
highly
interesting
to
every
german
while
by
other
writers
division
anarchy
and
impotence
had
been
brought
as
a
reproach
against
the
german
empire
according
to
möser
this
very
number
of
small
states
was
highly
desirable
as
affording
room
for
the
special
cultivation
of
each
according
to
its
necessities
which
must
vary
with
the
site
and
peculiarities
of
such
widely
different
provinces
in
the
same
way
i
remarked
that
möser
starting
with
the
city
and
bishopric
of
osnaburg
and
thence
going
over
the
circle
of
westphalia
set
forth
its
relation
to
the
whole
empire
and
just
as
he
in
the
further
examination
of
the
subject
uniting
the
past
with
the
present
deduced
the
latter
from
the
former
and
thus
clearly
shewed
what
alterations
were
desirable
or
not
so
might
every
ruler
by
proceeding
in
the
same
way
obtain
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
constitution
of
the
state
he
governs
its
connexion
with
its
neighbors
and
with
the
whole
empire
and
thus
enable
himself
to
judge
both
the
present
and
the
future
in
the
course
of
our
conversation
many
remarks
were
made
with
regard
to
the
difference
between
the
states
of
upper
and
lower
saxony
not
only
their
natural
productions
it
was
observed
but
also
their
manners
laws
and
customs
had
differed
from
the
earliest
times
and
according
to
the
form
of
religion
and
government
had
variously
modified
themselves
we
endeavoured
to
obtain
a
clear
view
of
the
differences
between
the
two
regions
and
in
this
attempt
it
soon
appeared
how
useful
it
would
be
to
have
a
good
model
which
if
regarded
not
in
its
individual
peculiarities
but
in
the
general
method
on
which
it
had
been
based
might
be
applied
to
the
most
widely
differing
cases
and
thereby
might
be
highly
serviceable
in
helping
us
to
form
a
correct
judgment
this
conversation
which
was
kept
up
when
we
were
set
down
at
table
made
a
better
impression
in
my
favor
than
i
perhaps
deserved
for
instead
of
making
such
works
as
belonged
to
my
own
sphere
of
literature
the
subjects
of
discussion
instead
of
demanding
an
undivided
attention
for
the
drama
and
for
romance
i
appeared
while
discussing
book
to
prefer
those
writers
whose
talents
proceeding
from
active
life
returned
to
it
with
immediate
benefit
whereas
works
properly
poetical
as
soaring
above
mere
social
and
material
interests
could
only
be
indirectly
and
accidentally
profitable
these
discussions
went
on
like
the
stories
of
the
arabian
nights
one
important
matter
came
up
after
another
many
themes
were
only
touched
upon
without
our
being
able
to
follow
them
out
and
accordingly
as
the
stay
of
the
young
princes
in
frankfort
was
necessarily
short
they
made
me
promise
to
follow
them
to
mayence
and
spend
a
few
days
with
them
there
i
gave
this
promise
gladly
enough
and
hastened
home
to
impart
the
agreeable
intelligence
to
my
parents
prospects
of
a
my
father
however
could
not
by
any
means
be
brought
to
approve
of
it
in
accordance
with
his
sentiments
as
a
citizen
of
the
empire
he
had
always
kept
aloof
from
the
great
and
although
constantly
coming
in
contact
with
the
of
the
neighboring
princes
he
had
nevertheless
avoided
all
personal
relations
with
them
in
fact
courts
were
among
the
things
about
which
he
was
accustomed
to
joke
he
was
not
indeed
displeased
if
any
one
opposed
his
opinions
on
this
head
only
he
was
not
satisfied
unless
his
opponent
maintained
his
side
with
wit
and
spirit
if
we
allowed
his
a
jove
procul
a
to
pass
but
added
that
with
lightning
the
question
was
not
so
much
whence
it
came
as
whither
it
went
he
would
bring
up
the
old
proverb
with
great
lords
it
is
not
good
to
eat
cherries
when
to
this
we
replied
that
it
was
yet
worse
to
eat
with
dainty
people
out
of
one
basket
he
would
not
deny
the
truth
of
this
only
he
was
sure
to
have
another
proverb
ready
at
hand
which
was
to
put
us
to
confusion
for
since
proverbs
and
rhyming
apophthegms
proceed
from
the
people
who
while
they
are
forced
to
obey
like
at
least
to
speak
their
vengeance
just
as
their
superiors
on
the
other
hand
indemnify
themselves
by
deeds
and
since
the
poetry
of
the
sixteenth
century
is
almost
wholly
of
a
nervous
didactic
character
there
is
in
our
language
no
lack
of
jests
and
serious
adages
directed
from
below
upwards
we
juniors
however
now
began
to
aim
from
above
downwards
fancying
ourselves
something
great
as
we
took
up
the
cause
of
the
great
of
these
sayings
and
i
will
here
insert
a
few
a
long
at

there

prospects
of
a
as
i
was
lately
looking
up
these
rhymes
in
some
old
memorandum
books
i
fell
in
with
many
such
in
which
we
had
amplified
pithy
old
german
saws
in
order
to
set
them
off
against
other
proverbs
which
are
equally
verified
by
experience
a
selection
from
them
may
perhaps
hereafter
as
an
epilogue
to
the
puppenspiele
puppet
shows
suggest
some
pleasant
reflections
but
all
these
rejoinders
could
not
move
my
father
from
his
opinions
he
was
in
the
habit
of
saving
his
most
stringent
argument
for
the
close
of
the
discussion
this
consisted
of
a
minute
description
of
voltaire
adventure
with
frederick
the
second
he
told
us
how
the
unbounded
favor
familiarity
mutual
obligations
were
at
once
revoked
and
forgotten
how
he
had
lived
to
see
the
comedy
out
in
the
arrest
of
that
extraordinary
poet
and
writer
by
the
frankfort
civic
guard
on
the
complaint
of
the
resident
freytag
and
the
warrant
of
the
burgomaster
fichard
and
his
confinement
for
some
time
in
the
tavern
of
the
rose
on
the
zeil
to
this
we
might
have
answered
in
many
ways
among
others
that
voltaire
was
not
free
from
blame
himself
but
from
filial
respect
we
always
yielded
the
point
on
the
present
occasion
when
these
things
and
others
like
them
were
alluded
to
i
hardly
knew
how
to
demean
myself
for
he
warned
me
explicitly
maintaining
that
the
invitation
was
given
only
to
entice
me
into
a
trap
in
order
to
take
vengeance
on
me
for
my
mischievous
treatment
of
the
favored
wieland
fully
as
i
was
convinced
of
the
contrary
yet
as
i
saw
but
too
plainly
that
a
preconceived
opinion
excited
by
hypochondriac
fancies
afflicted
my
worthy
father
i
was
unwilling
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
his
convictions
still
i
could
not
find
any
excuse
for
failing
to
keep
my
promise
without
appearing
ungrateful
and
uncourteous
unfortunately
our
friend
fraülein
von
klettenberg
to
whose
advice
we
usually
resorted
in
such
cases
was
confined
to
her
bed
in
her
and
my
mother
i
had
two
incomparable
companions
i
called
them
word
and
deed
for
when
the
former
cast
her
serene
or
rather
blissful
glance
over
earthly
things
what
was
confusion
to
us
children
of
earth
at
once
grew
plain
before
her
and
she
could
almost
always
point
out
the
right
way
because
she
looked
upon
the
labyrinth
from
above
and
was
not
herself
entangled
in
it
when
a
decision
was
once
made
the
readiness
and
energy
of
my
mother
could
be
relied
on
while
the
former
had
sight
for
her
aid
the
latter
had
faith
and
as
she
maintained
her
serenity
in
all
cases
she
was
never
without
the
means
of
accomplishing
what
was
proposed
or
desired
accordingly
she
was
now
despatched
to
our
sick
friend
to
obtain
her
opinion
and
when
this
turned
out
in
my
favour
she
was
entreated
to
gain
the
consent
of
my
father
who
yielded
against
his
belief
and
will
gods
heroes
and
wieland
it
was
in
a
very
cold
season
of
the
year
that
i
arrived
at
the
appointed
hour
in
mayence
my
reception
by
the
young
princes
and
by
their
attendants
was
no
less
friendly
than
the
invitation
the
conversation
in
frankfort
was
recalled
and
resumed
at
the
point
where
it
had
been
broken
off
when
it
touched
upon
the
recent
german
literature
and
its
audacities
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
my
famous
piece
helden
und
gods
heroes
and
wieland
should
come
up
at
which
i
remarked
with
satisfaction
that
the
thing
was
regarded
with
good
humor
being
called
on
to
give
the
real
history
of
this
which
had
excited
so
great
attention
i
could
not
avoid
confessing
first
of
all
that
as
true
fellows
of
the
upper
rhine
we
had
no
bounds
either
to
our
liking
or
disliking
with
us
reverence
for
shakspeare
was
carried
to
adoration
but
wieland
with
his
decided
peculiarity
of
destroying
the
interest
both
of
himself
and
of
his
readers
had
in
the
notes
to
his
translation
found
much
fault
with
the
great
author
and
that
in
such
a
way
as
to
vex
us
exceedingly
and
to
diminish
in
our
eyes
the
value
of
the
work
we
saw
that
wieland
whom
we
had
so
highly
revered
as
a
poet
and
who
as
a
translator
had
rendered
such
great
service
was
as
a
critic
capricious
and
unjust
besides
this
he
had
deliberately
spoken
against
our
idols
the
greeks
and
this
sharpened
our
hostility
yet
more
it
is
well
known
that
the
greek
gods
and
heroes
are
eminent
not
for
moral
but
for
glorified
physical
qualities
for
which
reason
they
afford
such
splendid
subjects
to
artists
now
wieland
in
his
had
presented
heroes
and
after
the
modern
fashion
against
this
we
had
nothing
to
say
as
every
one
is
at
liberty
to
mould
poetic
traditions
to
his
own
ends
and
way
of
thinking
but
in
the
letters
on
this
opera
which
he
inserted
in
the
he
appeared
to
us
unduly
to
exalt
this
mode
of
treating
them
in
short
to
show
too
much
of
the
partisan
and
to
commit
an
unpardonable
sin
against
the
good
ancients
and
their
higher
style
by
his
absolute
unwillingness
to
recognise
the
strong
healthy
nature
which
is
the
basis
of
their
productions
i
told
them
we
had
hardly
discussed
these
grievances
with
some
vehemence
in
our
little
society
when
my
ordinary
rage
for
dramatizing
everything
came
upon
me
one
sunday
afternoon
and
so
at
one
sitting
over
a
bottle
of
good
burgundy
i
wrote
off
the
whole
piece
just
as
it
stands
it
was
no
sooner
read
to
those
of
my
colleagues
as
were
present
and
received
by
them
with
exclamations
of
delight
than
i
sent
the
manuscript
to
lenz
at
strasburg
who
appeared
enraptured
with
it
and
maintained
that
it
must
be
printed
without
delay
after
some
correspondence
i
at
last
consented
and
he
put
it
hastily
to
press
at
strasburg
some
time
afterwards
i
learned
that
this
was
one
of
the
first
steps
which
lenz
took
in
his
design
to
injure
me
and
to
bring
me
into
disgrace
with
the
public
but
at
that
time
i
neither
knew
nor
surmised
anything
of
the
kind
in
this
way
i
narrated
to
my
new
patrons
with
perfect
candour
the
innocent
origin
of
the
piece
as
well
as
i
knew
it
myself
in
order
to
convince
them
that
it
contained
no
personality
nor
any
ulterior
motive
i
also
took
care
to
let
them
understand
with
what
gaiety
and
recklessness
we
were
accustomed
to
banter
and
ridicule
each
other
among
ourselves
with
this
i
saw
that
they
were
quite
content
they
almost
admired
the
great
fear
we
had
lest
any
one
of
ourselves
should
go
to
sleep
upon
his
laurels
they
compared
such
a
society
to
those
buccaneers
who
in
every
moment
of
repose
are
afraid
of
becoming
effeminate
and
whose
leaders
when
there
are
no
enemies
in
sight
and
there
is
no
one
to
plunder
will
let
off
a
pistol
under
the
in
order
that
even
in
peace
there
may
be
no
want
of
wounds
and
horrors
after
considerable
discussion
pro
and
con
upon
this
subject
i
was
at
last
induced
to
write
wieland
a
friendly
letter
i
gladly
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
as
in
the
he
had
spoken
most
liberally
of
this
piece
of
youthful
folly
and
as
in
literary
feuds
was
almost
always
his
custom
had
ended
the
affair
in
the
most
skilful
manner
prometheus
deucalion
and
his
reviewers
the
few
days
of
my
stay
at
mayence
passed
off
very
pleasantly
for
when
my
new
patrons
were
abroad
on
visits
and
banquets
i
remained
with
their
attendants
drew
the
portraits
of
several
or
went
skating
for
which
the
frozen
ditches
of
the
fortification
afforded
excellent
opportunity
i
returned
home
full
of
the
kindness
i
had
met
with
and
as
i
entered
the
house
was
on
the
point
of
emptying
my
heart
by
a
minute
account
of
it
but
i
saw
only
troubled
faces
and
the
conviction
was
soon
forced
upon
me
that
our
friend
fraülein
von
klettenberg
was
no
more
at
this
i
was
greatly
concerned
because
in
my
present
situation
i
needed
her
more
than
ever
they
told
me
for
my
consolation
that
a
pious
death
had
crowned
her
happy
life
and
that
the
cheerfulness
of
her
faith
had
remained
undisturbed
to
the
end
but
there
was
also
another
obstacle
in
the
way
of
a
free
communication
on
the
subject
of
my
visit
my
father
instead
of
rejoicing
at
the
fortunate
issue
of
this
little
adventure
persisted
in
his
opinion
and
maintained
on
the
other
hand
that
it
was
nothing
but
dissimulation
and
that
perhaps
there
was
a
danger
of
their
carrying
out
in
the
end
something
still
worse
against
me
i
was
thus
driven
to
my
younger
friends
with
my
narrative
and
to
them
i
could
not
tell
it
circumstantially
enough
but
their
attachment
and
good
will
led
to
a
result
which
to
me
was
most
unpleasant
shortly
afterwards
appeared
a
pamphlet
called
prometheus
deucalion
and
his
reviewers
also
in
a
dramatic
form
in
this
the
comical
notion
was
carried
out
of
putting
little
figures
before
the
dialogue
instead
of
proper
names
and
representing
by
all
sorts
of
satirical
images
those
critics
who
had
expressed
an
opinion
upon
my
works
or
on
works
akin
to
them
in
one
place
the
altona
courier
without
his
head
was
blowing
his
horn
here
a
bear
was
growling
and
there
a
goose
was
cackling
the
too
was
not
forgotten
and
many
wild
and
tame
animals
were
represented
in
the
of
the
sculptor
endeavoring
to
put
him
out
while
he
without
taking
particular
notice
of
them
kept
zealously
at
his
work
and
did
not
refrain
from
expressing
his
opinion
about
the
matter
in
general
the
appearance
of
this
surprised
me
much
and
was
as
unexpected
as
it
was
disagreeable
its
style
and
tone
evidently
showed
that
it
was
by
one
of
our
society
and
indeed
i
feared
it
might
be
attributed
to
me
but
what
was
most
annoying
was
the
circumstance
that
prometheus
brought
out
some
allusions
to
my
stay
at
mayence
and
to
what
was
said
there
which
nobody
but
myself
could
have
known
to
me
this
was
a
proof
that
the
author
was
one
of
those
who
formed
my
most
intimate
circle
of
friends
where
he
must
have
heard
me
relate
these
events
in
detail
accordingly
we
all
looked
at
each
other
and
each
suspected
the
rest
but
the
unknown
writer
managed
very
well
to
keep
his
own
secret
i
uttered
vehement
reproaches
against
him
because
it
was
exceedingly
vexatious
to
me
after
so
gracious
a
reception
and
so
important
a
conversation
and
after
the
confiding
letter
i
had
written
to
wieland
to
see
here
an
occasion
for
fresh
distrust
and
disagreement
however
my
uncertainty
on
this
point
was
not
of
long
duration
as
i
walked
up
and
down
my
room
reading
the
book
aloud
i
heard
clearly
in
the
fancies
and
the
turns
of
expression
the
voice
of
wagner
and
it
was
he
when
i
had
rushed
down
stairs
to
impart
my
discovery
to
my
mother
she
confessed
to
me
that
she
already
knew
it
annoyed
at
the
ill
results
of
what
had
seemed
to
him
a
good
and
praiseworthy
plan
the
author
had
discovered
himself
to
her
and
besought
her
intercession
with
me
not
to
fulfil
in
his
person
my
threat
of
holding
no
further
intercourse
with
the
writer
who
had
so
abused
my
confidence
the
fact
that
i
had
found
him
out
myself
was
very
much
in
his
favour
and
the
satisfaction
always
attending
a
discovery
of
one
own
inclined
me
to
be
merciful
the
fault
which
had
given
occasion
for
such
a
proof
of
my
sagacity
was
forgiven
nevertheless
it
was
not
easy
to
convince
the
public
that
wagner
was
the
author
and
that
i
had
had
no
hand
in
the
game
no
one
believed
that
he
possessed
such
versatility
of
talent
and
no
one
reflected
that
it
was
very
easy
for
him
though
possessing
no
remarkable
talents
of
his
own
to
notice
seize
upon
and
bring
out
in
his
own
way
all
that
for
some
time
had
passed
either
in
jest
and
earnest
in
an
intellectual
society
and
thus
on
this
occasion
as
on
many
others
afterwards
i
had
to
suffer
not
only
for
my
own
follies
but
also
for
the
indiscretion
and
precipitancy
of
my
friends
as
the
remembrance
of
them
is
here
suggested
by
many
circumstances
i
will
speak
of
some
distinguished
men
who
at
different
times
on
their
passage
through
frankfort
either
lodged
at
our
house
or
partook
of
our
friendly
hospitality
once
more
klopstock
stands
justly
at
the
head
i
had
already
exchanged
several
letters
with
him
when
he
announced
to
me
that
he
was
invited
to
go
to
carlsruhe
and
to
reside
there
that
he
would
be
in
friedberg
by
a
specified
day
and
wished
that
i
would
come
there
and
fetch
him
i
did
not
fail
to
be
there
at
the
hour
he
however
had
been
accidently
detained
upon
the
road
and
after
i
had
waited
in
vain
for
some
days
i
went
home
where
he
did
not
arrive
till
after
some
time
and
then
excused
his
delay
and
received
very
kindly
my
readiness
to
come
to
meet
him
his
person
was
small
but
his
manners
without
being
stiff
were
serious
and
precise
his
conversation
was
measured
and
agreeable
on
the
whole
there
was
something
of
the
diplomatist
in
his
bearing
such
a
man
undertakes
the
difficult
task
of
supporting
at
the
same
time
his
own
dignity
and
that
of
a
superior
to
whom
he
is
responsible
of
advancing
his
own
interest
together
with
the
much
more
important
interest
of
a
prince
or
even
of
a
whole
state
and
of
making
himself
beyond
all
things
pleasing
to
other
men
while
in
this
critical
position
in
this
way
klopstock
appeared
to
bear
himself
as
a
man
of
worth
and
as
the
representative
of
other
things
of
religion
of
morality
and
freedom
he
had
also
assumed
another
peculiarity
of
men
of
the
world
namely
not
readily
to
speak
on
subjects
upon
which
he
was
particularly
expected
and
desired
to
discourse
he
was
seldom
heard
to
mention
poetic
and
literary
subjects
but
as
he
found
in
me
and
my
friends
a
set
of
passionate
skaters
he
discoursed
to
us
at
length
on
this
noble
art
on
which
he
had
thought
much
having
considered
what
in
it
was
to
be
sought
and
what
avoided
still
before
we
could
receive
the
instruction
he
proffered
we
had
to
submit
to
be
put
right
as
to
the
word
itself
in
which
we
blundered
we
spoke
in
good
of
which
he
would
not
allow
to
pass
at
all
for
the
word
he
said
does
not
come
from
sledge
as
if
one
went
on
little
runners
but
from
to
stride
because
like
the
homeric
gods
the
skater
strides
away
on
these
winged
shoes
over
the
sea
frozen
into
a
plain
next
we
came
to
the
instrument
itself
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
high
grooved
skates
but
recommended
the
low
broad
friseland
steel
skates
as
the
most
serviceable
for
speed
he
was
no
friend
to
the
tricks
of
art
which
are
usually
performed
in
this
exercise
i
procured
according
to
his
advice
a
pair
of
smooth
skates
with
long
toes
and
used
them
for
several
years
though
with
some
discomfort
he
understood
too
the
science
of
horsemanship
and
and
liked
to
talk
about
it
thus
as
if
by
design
he
avoided
all
conversation
upon
his
own
profession
that
he
might
speak
with
greater
freedom
about
arts
quite
foreign
to
it
which
he
pursued
only
as
a
pastime
i
might
say
much
more
of
these
and
other
peculiarities
of
this
extraordinary
man
if
those
who
lived
longer
with
him
had
not
already
informed
us
fully
about
them
one
observation
however
i
will
not
suppress
which
is
that
men
whom
nature
after
endowing
them
with
uncommon
advantages
has
placed
in
a
narrow
circle
of
action
or
at
least
in
one
disproportioned
to
their
powers
generally
fall
into
eccentricities
and
as
they
have
no
opportunity
of
making
direct
use
of
their
gifts
seek
to
employ
them
in
an
extraordinary
or
whimsical
manner
zimmermann
zimmermann
was
also
for
a
time
our
guest
he
was
tall
and
powerfully
built
of
a
vehement
nature
open
to
every
impulse
yet
he
had
his
outward
bearing
and
manners
perfectly
under
control
so
that
in
society
he
appeared
as
a
skilful
physician
and
polished
man
of
the
world
it
was
only
in
his
writings
and
amongst
his
most
confidential
friends
that
he
gave
free
course
to
his
untamed
inward
character
his
conversation
was
varied
and
highly
instructive
and
for
one
who
could
pardon
his
keen
sensitiveness
to
whatever
grated
on
his
own
personal
feelings
and
merits
no
more
desirable
companion
could
be
found
for
myself
as
what
is
called
vanity
never
disturbed
me
and
i
in
return
often
presumed
to
be
vain
also
that
is
did
not
hesitate
to
enlarge
upon
whatever
in
myself
pleased
me
i
got
on
with
him
capitally
we
mutually
tolerated
and
scolded
each
other
and
as
he
showed
himself
thoroughly
open
and
communicative
i
learned
from
him
a
great
deal
in
a
short
time
to
judge
such
a
man
with
the
indulgence
of
gratitude
nay
on
principle
i
can
not
say
that
he
was
vain
we
germans
misuse
the
word
vain
citel
but
too
often
in
a
strict
sense
it
carries
with
it
the
idea
of
emptiness
and
we
properly
designate
by
it
only
the
man
who
can
not
conceal
his
joy
at
his
nothing
his
contentment
with
a
hollow
phantom
with
zimmermann
it
was
exactly
the
reverse
he
had
great
deserts
and
no
inward
satisfaction
the
man
who
can
not
enjoy
his
own
natural
gifts
in
silence
and
find
his
reward
in
the
exercise
of
them
but
must
wait
and
hope
for
their
recognition
and
appreciation
by
others
will
generally
find
himself
but
badly
off
because
it
is
but
too
well
known
a
fact
that
men
are
very
niggard
of
their
applause
that
they
rather
love
to
mingle
alloy
with
praise
and
where
it
can
in
any
degree
be
done
to
turn
it
into
blame
whoever
comes
before
the
public
without
being
prepared
for
this
will
meet
with
nothing
but
vexation
since
even
if
he
does
not
overestimate
his
own
production
it
still
has
for
him
an
unlimited
value
while
the
reception
it
meets
with
in
the
world
is
in
every
case
qualified
besides
a
certain
susceptibility
is
necessary
for
praise
and
applause
as
for
every
other
pleasure
let
this
be
applied
to
zimmermann
and
it
will
be
acknowledged
in
his
case
too
that
no
one
can
obtain
what
he
does
not
bring
with
him
zimmermann
if
this
apology
can
not
be
allowed
still
less
shall
we
be
able
to
justify
another
fault
of
this
remarkable
man
because
it
disturbed
and
even
destroyed
the
happiness
of
others
i
mean
his
conduct
towards
his
children
a
daughter
who
travelled
with
him
stayed
with
us
while
he
visited
the
neighbouring
scenes
she
might
be
about
sixteen
years
old
slender
and
well
formed
but
without
attractiveness
her
regular
features
would
have
been
agreeable
if
there
had
appeared
in
them
a
trace
of
animation
but
she
was
always
as
quiet
as
a
statue
she
spoke
seldom
and
in
the
presence
of
her
father
never
but
she
had
scarcely
spent
a
few
days
alone
with
my
mother
receiving
the
cheerful
and
affectionate
attentions
of
this
sympathizing
woman
than
she
threw
herself
at
her
feet
with
an
opened
heart
and
with
a
thousand
tears
begged
to
be
allowed
to
remain
with
her
with
the
most
passionate
language
she
declared
that
she
would
remain
in
the
house
as
a
servant
as
a
slave
all
her
life
rather
than
go
back
with
her
father
of
whose
severity
and
tyranny
no
one
could
form
an
idea
her
brother
had
gone
mad
under
his
treatment
she
had
hitherto
borne
it
though
with
difficulty
because
she
had
believed
that
it
was
the
same
or
not
much
better
in
every
family
but
now
that
she
had
experienced
such
a
loving
mild
and
considerate
treatment
her
situation
at
home
had
become
to
her
a
perfect
hell
my
mother
was
greatly
moved
as
she
related
to
me
this
passionate
effusion
and
indeed
she
went
so
far
in
her
sympathy
as
to
give
me
pretty
clearly
to
understand
that
she
would
be
content
to
keep
the
girl
in
the
house
if
i
would
make
up
my
mind
to
marry
her
if
she
were
an
orphan
i
replied
i
might
think
and
talk
it
over
but
god
keep
me
from
a
who
is
such
a
father
my
mother
took
great
pains
with
the
poor
girl
but
this
made
her
only
the
more
unhappy
at
last
an
expedient
was
found
by
putting
her
to
a
her
life
i
should
observe
in
passing
was
not
a
very
long
one
i
should
hardly
mention
this
culpable
peculiarity
of
a
man
of
such
great
deserts
if
it
had
not
already
become
a
matter
of
public
notoriety
and
especially
had
not
the
unfortunate
hypochondria
with
which
in
his
last
hours
he
tortured
himself
and
others
been
commonly
talked
of
for
that
severity
towards
his
children
was
nothing
less
than
hypochondria
a
partial
insanity
a
continuous
moral
murder
which
after
making
his
children
its
victims
was
at
last
directed
against
himself
we
must
also
remember
that
though
apparently
in
such
good
health
he
was
a
great
sufferer
even
in
his
best
years
that
an
incurable
disease
troubled
the
skilful
physician
who
had
relieved
and
still
gave
ease
to
so
many
of
the
afflicted
yes
this
distinguished
man
with
all
his
outward
reputation
fame
honour
rank
and
wealth
led
the
saddest
life
and
whoever
will
take
the
pains
to
learn
more
about
it
from
existing
publications
will
not
condemn
but
pity
him
if
it
is
now
expected
that
i
shall
give
a
more
precise
account
of
the
effect
which
this
distinguished
man
had
upon
me
i
must
once
more
recall
the
general
features
of
that
period
the
epoch
in
which
we
were
living
might
be
called
an
epoch
of
high
requisitions
for
every
one
demanded
of
himself
and
of
others
what
no
mortal
had
hitherto
accomplished
on
chosen
spirits
who
could
think
and
feel
a
light
had
arisen
which
enabled
them
to
see
that
an
immediate
original
understanding
of
nature
and
a
course
of
action
based
upon
it
was
both
the
best
thing
a
man
could
desire
and
also
not
difficult
to
attain
experience
thus
once
more
became
the
universal
watchword
and
every
one
opened
his
eyes
as
wide
as
he
could
physicians
especially
had
a
most
pressing
call
to
labour
to
this
end
and
the
best
opportunity
for
finding
it
upon
them
a
star
shone
out
of
antiquity
which
could
serve
as
an
example
of
all
that
was
to
be
desired
the
writings
which
had
come
down
to
us
under
the
name
of
hippocrates
furnished
a
model
of
the
way
in
which
a
man
should
both
observe
the
world
and
relate
what
he
had
seen
without
mixing
up
himself
with
it
but
no
one
considered
that
we
can
not
see
like
the
greeks
and
that
we
shall
never
become
such
poets
sculptors
and
physicians
as
they
were
even
granted
that
we
could
learn
from
them
still
the
results
of
experience
already
gone
through
were
almost
beyond
number
and
besides
were
not
always
of
the
clearest
kind
moreover
had
too
often
been
made
to
accord
with
preconceived
opinions
all
these
were
to
be
mastered
discriminated
and
sifted
this
also
was
an
immense
demand
then
again
it
was
required
that
each
observer
in
his
personal
sphere
and
labours
should
acquaint
himself
with
the
true
healthy
nature
as
if
she
were
now
for
the
first
time
noticed
and
attended
and
thus
only
what
was
genuine
and
real
was
to
be
learned
but
as
in
general
learning
can
never
exist
without
the
accompaniment
of
a
universal
smattering
and
a
universal
pedantry
nor
the
practice
of
any
profession
without
empiricism
and
charlatanry
so
there
sprung
up
a
violent
conflict
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
guard
use
from
abuse
and
place
the
kernel
high
above
the
shell
in
estimation
in
the
execution
of
this
design
it
was
perceived
that
the
shortest
way
of
getting
out
of
the
affair
was
to
call
in
the
aid
of
genius
whose
magic
gifts
could
settle
the
strife
and
accomplish
what
was
required
meanwhile
however
the
understanding
meddled
with
the
matter
all
it
alleged
must
be
reduced
to
clear
notions
and
exhibited
in
a
logical
form
that
every
prejudice
might
be
put
aside
and
all
superstition
destroyed
and
since
the
achievements
of
some
extraordinary
men
such
as
boerhaave
and
haller
were
actually
incredible
people
thought
themselves
justified
in
demanding
even
still
more
from
their
pupils
and
successors
it
was
maintained
that
the
path
was
opened
forgetting
that
in
earthly
things
a
path
can
very
rarely
be
spoken
of
for
as
the
water
that
is
dislodged
by
a
ship
instantly
flows
in
again
behind
it
so
by
the
law
of
its
nature
when
eminent
spirits
have
once
driven
error
aside
and
made
a
place
for
themselves
it
very
quickly
closes
upon
them
again
zimmermann
but
of
this
the
ardent
zimmermann
could
form
no
idea
whatever
he
would
not
admit
that
absurdity
did
in
fact
fill
up
the
world
impatient
even
to
madness
he
rushed
to
attack
everything
that
he
saw
and
believed
to
be
wrong
it
was
all
the
same
to
him
whether
he
was
fighting
with
a
nurse
or
with
paracelsus
with
a
quack
or
a
chemist
his
blows
fell
alike
heavily
in
either
case
and
when
he
had
worked
himself
out
of
breath
he
was
greatly
astonished
to
see
the
heads
of
this
hydra
which
he
thought
he
had
trodden
under
foot
springing
up
all
fresh
again
and
showing
him
their
teeth
from
innumerable
jaws
every
one
who
reads
his
writings
especially
his
clever
work
on
experience
will
perceive
more
distinctly
than
i
can
express
them
the
subjects
of
discussion
between
this
excellent
man
and
myself
his
influence
over
me
was
the
more
powerful
as
he
was
twenty
years
my
senior
having
a
high
reputation
as
a
physician
he
was
chiefly
employed
among
the
upper
classes
and
the
corruption
of
the
times
caused
by
effeminacy
and
excess
was
a
constant
theme
of
conversation
with
him
thus
his
medical
discourses
like
those
of
the
philosophers
and
my
poetical
friends
drove
me
again
back
to
nature
in
his
vehement
passion
for
improvement
i
could
not
fully
participate
on
the
contrary
after
we
separated
i
instantly
drew
back
into
my
own
proper
calling
and
endeavoured
to
employ
the
gifts
nature
had
bestowed
upon
me
with
moderate
exertion
and
by
opposition
to
what
i
disapproved
of
to
gain
a
standing
for
myself
in
perfect
indifference
how
far
my
influence
might
reach
or
whither
it
might
lead
me
von
salis
who
was
setting
up
the
large
boarding
school
at
marsehlins
visited
us
also
at
that
time
he
was
an
earnest
and
intelligent
man
and
must
have
quietly
made
many
humorous
observations
on
the
irregular
though
genial
mode
of
life
in
our
little
society
the
same
was
probably
the
case
with
sulzer
who
came
in
contact
with
us
on
his
journey
to
the
south
of
france
at
least
a
passage
in
his
travels
where
he
speaks
of
me
seems
to
favor
this
opinion
these
visits
which
were
as
agreeable
as
they
were
profitable
were
however
diversified
by
others
which
we
would
rather
have
been
spared
needy
and
shameless
adventurers
fixed
themselves
on
the
confiding
youth
supporting
their
urgent
demands
by
real
as
well
as
fictitious
relationships
and
misfortunes
they
borrowed
my
money
and
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
borrow
in
turn
so
that
i
in
consequence
fell
into
the
most
unpleasant
position
with
opulent
and
friends
if
i
wished
that
all
these
unfortunate
folks
were
food
for
the
crows
my
father
found
himself
in
the
situation
of
the
in
who
was
willing
enough
to
see
his
house
washed
clean
but
is
frightened
when
the
flood
rushes
in
without
ceasing
over
threshold
and
stairs
by
an
excessive
kindness
the
quiet
and
moderate
plan
of
life
which
my
father
had
designed
for
me
was
step
by
step
interrupted
and
put
off
and
from
day
to
day
changed
contrary
to
all
expectation
all
idea
of
a
long
visit
to
ratisborn
and
vienna
was
as
good
as
given
up
but
still
i
was
to
pass
through
those
cities
on
my
way
to
italy
so
as
at
least
to
gain
a
general
notion
of
them
on
the
other
hand
some
of
my
friends
who
did
not
approve
of
taking
so
long
a
circuit
in
order
to
get
into
active
life
recommended
that
i
should
take
advantage
of
a
moment
which
seemed
in
every
way
favorable
and
think
on
a
permanent
establishment
in
my
native
city
although
the
council
were
closed
against
me
first
by
my
grandfather
and
then
by
my
uncle
there
were
yet
many
civil
offices
to
which
i
could
lay
claim
where
i
could
remain
for
a
time
and
await
the
future
there
were
agencies
of
several
kinds
which
offered
employment
enough
and
the
place
of
a
was
highly
respectable
i
suffered
myself
to
be
persuaded
and
believed
also
that
i
might
adapt
myself
to
this
plan
without
having
tried
whether
i
was
suited
for
such
a
mode
of
life
and
business
as
requires
that
amid
dissipation
we
should
most
of
all
act
for
a
certain
end
to
these
plans
and
designs
there
was
now
added
a
tender
sentiment
which
seemed
to
draw
me
towards
a
domestic
life
and
to
accelerate
my
determination
plans
for
settling
in
life
the
society
of
young
men
and
women
already
mentioned
which
was
kept
together
by
if
it
did
not
owe
its
origin
to
my
sister
still
survived
after
her
marriage
and
departure
because
the
members
had
grown
accustomed
to
each
other
and
could
not
spend
one
evening
in
the
week
better
than
in
this
friendly
circle
the
eccentric
orator
also
whose
acquaintance
we
made
in
the
sixth
book
had
after
many
adventures
returned
to
us
more
clever
and
more
perverse
than
ever
and
once
again
played
the
legislator
of
the
little
state
as
a
sequel
to
our
former
diversions
he
had
devised
something
of
the
same
kind
he
enacted
that
every
week
lots
should
be
drawn
not
as
before
to
decide
what
pairs
should
be
lovers
but
married
couples
how
lovers
should
conduct
themselves
towards
each
other
he
said
we
knew
well
enough
but
of
the
proper
deportment
of
husbands
and
wives
in
society
we
were
totally
ignorant
and
this
with
our
increasing
years
we
ought
to
learn
before
all
things
he
laid
down
general
rules
which
of
course
set
forth
that
we
must
act
as
if
we
did
not
belong
to
each
other
that
we
must
not
sit
or
speak
often
together
much
less
indulge
in
anything
like
caresses
and
at
the
same
time
we
were
not
only
to
avoid
everything
which
would
occasion
mutual
suspicion
and
discord
but
on
the
contrary
he
was
to
win
the
greatest
praises
who
with
his
free
and
open
manners
should
yet
most
endear
to
himself
his
wife
the
lots
were
at
once
drawn
some
odd
matches
that
they
decided
were
laughed
at
and
joked
about
and
the
universal
was
begun
in
good
humour
and
renewed
every
week
now
it
fell
out
strangely
enough
that
from
the
first
the
same
lady
fell
twice
to
me
she
was
a
very
good
creature
just
such
a
woman
as
one
would
like
to
think
of
as
a
wife
her
figure
was
beautiful
and
her
face
pleasing
while
in
her
manners
there
prevailed
a
repose
which
testified
to
the
health
of
her
mind
and
body
every
day
and
hour
she
was
perfectly
the
same
her
domestic
industry
was
in
high
repute
though
she
was
not
talkative
a
just
understanding
and
natural
talents
could
be
recognised
in
her
language
to
meet
the
advances
of
such
a
person
with
friendliness
and
esteem
was
natural
on
a
general
principle
i
was
already
accustomed
to
do
it
and
now
i
acted
from
a
sort
of
traditional
kindness
as
a
social
duty
but
when
the
lot
brought
us
together
for
the
third
time
our
jocose
declared
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
heaven
had
spoken
and
we
could
not
again
be
separated
we
submitted
to
his
sentence
and
both
of
us
adapted
ourselves
so
well
to
our
public
conjugal
duties
that
we
might
really
have
served
as
a
model
since
all
the
pairs
who
were
severally
united
for
the
evening
were
obliged
by
the
general
rules
to
address
each
other
for
the
few
hours
with
thou
we
had
after
a
series
of
weeks
grown
so
accustomed
to
this
confidential
pronoun
that
even
in
the
intervals
whenever
we
accidentally
came
together
the
would
kindly
come
out
habit
is
a
strange
thing
by
degrees
both
of
us
found
that
nothing
was
more
natural
than
this
relation
i
liked
her
more
and
more
while
her
manner
of
treating
me
gave
evidence
of
a
beautiful
calm
confidence
so
that
on
many
an
occasion
if
a
priest
had
been
present
we
might
have
been
united
on
the
spot
without
much
hesitation
the
clavigo
as
at
each
of
our
social
gatherings
something
new
was
required
to
be
read
aloud
i
brought
with
me
one
evening
a
perfect
novelty
the
memoir
of
beaumarchais
against
clavigo
in
the
original
it
gained
great
applause
the
thoughts
to
which
it
gave
occasion
were
freely
expressed
and
after
much
had
been
spoken
on
both
sides
my
partner
said
if
i
were
thy
liege
lady
and
not
thy
wife
i
would
entreat
thee
to
change
this
memoir
into
a
play
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
suited
for
it
that
thou
mayst
see
my
love
i
replied
that
liege
lady
and
wife
can
be
united
in
one
person
i
promise
that
at
the
end
of
a
week
the
of
this
work
in
the
form
of
a
piece
for
the
theatre
shall
be
read
aloud
as
has
just
been
done
with
these
pages
they
wondered
at
so
bold
a
promise
but
i
did
not
delay
to
set
about
accomplishing
it
what
in
such
cases
is
called
invention
was
with
me
instantaneous
as
i
was
escorting
home
my
titulary
wife
i
was
silent
she
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
am
thinking
out
the
play
i
answered
and
have
got
already
into
the
middle
of
it
i
wished
to
show
thee
that
i
would
gladly
do
anything
to
please
thee
she
pressed
my
hand
and
as
i
in
return
snatched
a
kiss
she
said
thou
must
forget
thy
character
to
be
loving
people
think
is
not
proper
for
married
folks
let
them
think
i
rejoined
we
will
have
it
our
own
way
before
i
got
home
and
indeed
i
look
a
very
circuitous
route
the
piece
was
pretty
far
advanced
lest
this
should
seem
boastful
i
will
confess
that
previously
on
the
first
and
second
reading
the
subject
had
appeared
to
me
dramatic
and
even
theatrical
but
without
such
a
stimulus
this
piece
like
so
many
others
would
have
remained
among
the
number
of
the
merely
possible
creations
my
mode
of
treating
it
is
well
enough
known
weary
of
villains
who
from
revenge
hate
or
mean
purposes
attack
a
noble
nature
and
ruin
it
i
wished
in
carlos
to
show
the
working
of
clear
good
sense
associated
with
true
friendship
against
passion
inclination
and
outward
necessity
in
order
for
once
to
compose
a
tragedy
in
this
way
availing
myself
of
the
example
of
our
patriarch
shakspeare
i
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
translate
word
for
word
the
chief
scene
and
all
that
was
properly
dramatic
in
the
original
finally
for
the
conclusion
i
borrowed
the
end
of
an
english
ballad
and
so
i
was
ready
before
the
friday
came
the
good
effect
which
i
attained
in
the
reading
will
easily
be
believed
my
liege
spouse
took
not
a
little
pleasure
in
it
and
it
seemed
as
if
by
this
production
as
an
intellectual
offspring
our
union
was
drawn
closer
and
dearer
mephistopheles
merck
here
did
me
for
the
first
time
a
great
injury
when
i
communicated
the
piece
to
him
he
answered
you
must
write
hereafter
no
more
such
trifles
others
can
do
such
things
in
this
he
was
wrong
we
should
not
in
all
things
transcend
the
notions
which
men
have
already
formed
it
is
good
that
much
should
be
in
accordance
with
the
common
way
of
thinking
had
i
at
that
time
written
a
dozen
such
pieces
which
with
a
little
stimulus
would
have
been
easy
enough
three
or
four
of
them
would
perhaps
have
retained
a
place
on
the
stage
every
theatrical
manager
who
knows
the
value
of
a
repertoire
can
say
what
an
advantage
that
would
have
been
by
these
and
other
intellectual
diversions
our
whimsical
game
of
marriage
became
a
family
story
if
not
the
talk
of
the
town
which
did
not
sound
disagreeably
in
the
ears
of
the
mothers
of
our
fair
ones
my
mother
also
was
not
at
all
opposed
to
such
an
event
she
had
before
looked
with
favor
on
the
lady
with
whom
i
had
fallen
into
so
strange
a
relation
and
did
not
doubt
that
she
would
make
as
good
a
as
a
wife
the
aimless
bustle
in
which
i
had
for
some
time
lived
was
not
to
her
mind
and
in
fact
she
had
to
bear
the
worst
of
it
it
was
her
part
to
provide
abundant
entertainment
for
the
stream
of
guests
without
any
compensation
for
furnishing
quarters
to
this
literary
army
other
than
the
honor
they
did
her
son
by
feasting
upon
him
besides
it
was
clear
to
her
that
so
many
young
persons
all
of
them
without
property
united
not
only
for
scientific
and
poetic
purposes
but
also
for
that
of
passing
the
time
in
the
gayest
manner
would
soon
become
a
burthen
and
injury
to
themselves
and
most
certainly
to
me
whose
thoughtless
generosity
and
passion
for
becoming
security
for
others
she
too
well
knew
accordingly
she
looked
on
the
italian
journey
which
my
father
once
more
brought
forward
as
the
best
means
of
cutting
short
all
these
connexions
at
once
but
in
order
that
no
new
danger
might
spring
up
in
the
wide
world
she
intended
first
of
all
to
bind
fast
the
union
which
had
already
been
suggested
so
as
to
make
a
return
into
my
native
country
more
desirable
and
my
final
determination
more
decided
whether
i
only
attribute
this
scheme
to
her
or
whether
she
had
actually
formed
it
with
her
departed
friend
i
am
not
quite
sure
enough
that
her
actions
seemed
to
be
based
on
a
plan
i
had
very
often
to
hear
from
her
a
regret
that
since
marriage
our
family
circle
was
altogether
too
small
it
was
felt
that
i
had
lost
a
sister
my
mother
an
assistant
and
my
father
a
pupil
nor
was
this
all
that
was
said
it
happened
as
if
by
accident
that
my
parents
met
the
lady
on
a
walk
invited
her
into
the
garden
and
conversed
with
her
for
a
long
time
thereupon
there
was
some
pleasantry
at
and
the
remark
was
made
with
a
certain
satisfaction
that
she
had
pleased
my
father
as
she
possessed
all
the
chief
qualities
which
he
as
a
connoisseur
of
women
required
preparations
for
my
wedding
one
thing
after
another
was
now
arranged
in
our
first
story
as
if
guests
were
expected
the
linen
was
reviewed
and
some
hitherto
neglected
furniture
was
thought
of
one
day
i
surprised
my
mother
in
a
garret
examining
the
old
cradles
among
which
an
immense
one
of
walnut
inlaid
with
ivory
and
ebony
in
which
i
had
formerly
been
rocked
was
especially
prominent
she
did
not
seem
altogether
pleased
when
i
said
to
her
that
such
were
quite
out
of
fashion
and
that
now
people
put
babies
with
free
limbs
into
a
neat
little
basket
and
carried
them
about
for
show
by
a
strap
over
the
shoulder
like
other
small
wares
enough
such
prognostics
of
a
renewal
of
domestic
activity
became
frequent
and
as
i
was
in
every
way
submissive
the
thought
of
a
state
which
would
last
through
life
spread
a
peace
over
our
house
and
its
inhabitants
such
as
had
not
been
enjoyed
for
a
long
time
there
are
two
words
used
for
skate
one
of
them
means
the
other
means
göthe
and
his
friends
make
use
of
the
former
klopstock
contends
for
the
latter
the
allusion
is
to
göthe
own
poem
der
zauberlehrling
members
of
the
same
family
address
each
other
with
the
second
person
singular
du
instead
of
the
more
formal
third
person
plural
sie
in
the
same
way
the
french
employ
tu
instead
of
vous
the
following
note
is
prefixed
by
the
author
to
the
last
portion
of
this
work
preface
in
treating
a
life
story
progressing
in
many
different
ways
like
this
which
we
have
ventured
to
undertake
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
be
intelligible
and
readable
that
some
parts
of
it
connected
in
time
should
be
separated
whilst
others
which
can
only
be
understood
by
a
connected
treatment
must
be
brought
together
and
the
whole
be
so
arranged
in
sections
that
the
reader
inspecting
it
intelligently
may
form
an
opinion
on
it
and
appropriate
a
good
deal
for
his
own
use
we
open
the
present
volume
with
this
reflexion
that
it
may
help
to
justify
our
mode
of
proceeding
and
we
add
the
request
that
our
readers
will
note
that
the
narrative
here
continued
does
not
exactly
fit
on
to
the
end
of
the
preceding
book
though
the
intention
is
to
gather
up
again
the
main
threads
one
by
one
and
to
bring
on
the
personages
as
well
as
the
thoughts
and
actions
in
a
virtually
complete
sequence

sixteenth
book
what
people
commonly
say
of
misfortunes
that
they
never
come
alone
may
with
almost
as
much
truth
be
said
also
of
good
fortune
and
indeed
of
other
circumstances
which
often
cluster
around
us
in
a
harmonious
way
whether
it
he
by
a
kind
of
fatality
or
whether
it
be
that
man
has
the
power
of
attracting
to
himself
all
mutually
related
things
at
any
rate
my
present
experience
shewed
me
everything
conspiring
to
produce
an
outward
and
an
inward
peace
the
former
came
to
me
while
i
resolved
patiently
to
await
the
result
of
what
others
were
meditating
and
designing
for
me
the
latter
however
i
had
to
attain
for
myself
by
renewing
former
studies
i
had
not
thought
of
spinoza
for
a
long
time
and
now
i
was
driven
to
him
by
an
attack
upon
him
in
our
library
i
found
a
little
book
the
author
of
which
railed
violently
against
that
original
thinker
and
to
go
the
more
effectually
to
work
had
inserted
for
a
frontispiece
a
picture
of
spinoza
himself
with
the
inscription
reprobationis
in
vultu
bearing
on
his
face
the
stamp
of
reprobation
this
there
was
no
gainsaying
indeed
so
long
as
one
looked
at
the
picture
for
the
engraving
was
wretchedly
bad
a
perfect
caricature
so
that
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
those
adversaries
who
when
they
conceive
a
dislike
to
any
one
first
of
all
misrepresent
him
and
then
assail
the
monster
of
their
own
creation
this
little
book
however
made
no
impression
upon
me
since
generally
i
did
not
like
controversial
works
but
preferred
always
to
learn
from
the
author
himself
how
he
did
think
than
to
hear
from
another
how
he
ought
to
have
thought
still
curiosity
led
me
to
the
article
spinoza
in
bayle
dictionary
a
work
as
valuable
for
its
learning
and
acuteness
as
it
is
ridiculous
and
pernicious
by
its
gossiping
and
scandal
spinoza
his
principles
the
article
spinoza
excited
in
me
displeasure
and
mistrust
in
the
first
place
the
philosopher
is
represented
as
an
atheist
and
his
opinions
as
most
abominable
but
immediately
afterwards
it
is
confessed
that
he
was
a
calmly
reflecting
man
devoted
to
his
studies
a
good
citizen
a
sympathizing
neighbour
and
a
peaceable
individual
the
writer
seemed
to
me
to
have
quite
forgotten
the
words
of
the
gospel
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
for
how
could
a
life
pleasing
in
the
sight
of
god
and
man
spring
from
corrupt
principles
i
well
remembered
what
peace
of
mind
and
clearness
of
ideas
came
over
me
when
i
first
turned
over
the
posthumous
works
of
that
remarkable
man
the
effect
itself
was
still
quite
distinct
to
my
mind
though
i
could
not
recall
the
particulars
i
therefore
speedily
had
recourse
again
to
the
work
to
which
i
had
owed
so
much
and
again
the
same
calm
air
breathed
over
me
i
gave
myself
up
to
this
reading
and
believed
while
i
looked
into
myself
that
i
had
never
before
so
clearly
seen
through
the
world
as
on
this
subject
there
always
has
been
and
still
is
even
in
these
later
times
so
much
controversy
i
would
not
wish
to
be
misunderstood
and
therefore
i
make
here
a
few
remarks
upon
these
so
much
feared
yea
abhorred
views
our
physical
as
well
as
our
social
life
manners
customs
worldly
wisdom
philosophy
religion
and
many
an
accidental
event
all
call
upon
us
deny
much
that
is
most
inwardly
peculiar
to
us
we
are
not
allowed
to
develope
much
that
we
need
from
without
for
the
completion
of
our
character
is
withheld
while
on
the
other
hand
so
much
is
forced
upon
us
which
is
as
alien
to
us
as
it
is
burdensome
we
are
robbed
of
all
that
we
have
laboriously
acquired
for
ourselves
or
friendly
circumstances
have
bestowed
upon
us
and
before
we
can
see
clearly
what
we
are
we
find
ourselves
compelled
to
part
with
our
personality
piece
by
piece
till
at
last
it
is
gone
altogether
indeed
the
case
is
so
universal
that
it
seems
a
law
of
society
to
despise
a
man
who
shows
himself
surly
on
that
account
on
the
contrary
the
bitterer
the
cup
we
have
to
drink
the
more
pleasant
face
must
one
make
in
order
that
composed
lookers
on
may
not
be
offended
by
the
least
grimace
to
solve
this
painful
problem
however
nature
has
endowed
man
with
ample
power
activity
and
endurance
but
especially
is
he
aided
therein
by
his
volatility
a
boon
to
man
which
nothing
can
take
away
by
its
means
he
is
able
to
renounce
the
cherished
object
of
the
moment
if
only
the
next
presents
him
something
new
to
reach
at
and
thus
he
goes
on
unconsciously
remodelling
his
whole
life
we
are
continually
putting
one
passion
in
the
place
of
another
employments
inclinations
tastes
hobbies
we
try
them
all
only
to
exclaim
at
last
all
is
vanity
no
one
is
shocked
by
this
false
and
murmuring
speech
nay
every
one
thinks
while
he
says
it
that
he
is
uttering
a
wise
and
indisputable
maxim
a
few
men
there
are
and
only
a
few
who
anticipate
this
insupportable
feeling
and
avoid
all
calls
to
such
partial
resignation
by
one
grand
act
of
total
such
men
convince
themselves
of
the
eternal
the
necessary
and
of
immutable
law
and
seek
to
form
to
themselves
ideas
which
are
incorruptible
nay
which
observation
of
the
perishable
does
not
shake
but
rather
confirms
but
since
in
this
there
is
something
superhuman
such
persons
are
commonly
esteemed
without
a
god
and
without
a
world
people
hardly
know
what
sort
of
horns
and
claws
to
give
them
my
confidence
in
spinoza
rested
on
the
serene
effect
he
wrought
in
me
and
it
only
increased
when
i
found
my
worthy
mystics
were
accused
of
spinozism
and
learned
that
even
leibnitz
himself
could
not
escape
the
charge
nay
that
boerhaave
being
suspected
of
similar
sentiments
had
to
abandon
theology
for
medicine
but
let
no
one
think
that
i
would
have
subscribed
to
his
writings
and
assented
to
them
et
for
that
no
one
really
understands
another
that
no
one
attaches
the
same
idea
to
the
same
word
which
another
does
that
a
dialogue
a
book
excites
in
different
persons
different
trains
of
thought
this
i
had
long
seen
all
too
plainly
and
the
reader
will
trust
the
assertion
of
the
author
of
faust
and
werther
that
deeply
experienced
in
such
misunderstandings
he
was
never
so
presumptuous
as
to
think
that
he
understood
perfectly
a
man
who
as
the
scholar
of
descartes
raised
himself
through
mathematical
and
rabbinical
studies
to
the
highest
reach
of
thought
and
whose
name
even
at
this
day
seems
to
mark
the
limit
of
all
speculative
efforts
how
much
i
appropriated
from
spinoza
would
be
seen
distinctly
enough
if
the
visit
of
the
wandering
jew
to
spinoza
which
i
had
devised
as
a
worthy
ingredient
for
that
poem
existed
in
writing
but
it
pleased
me
so
much
in
the
conception
and
i
found
so
much
delight
in
meditating
on
it
in
silence
that
i
never
could
bring
myself
to
the
point
of
writing
it
out
thus
the
notion
which
would
have
been
well
enough
as
a
passing
joke
expanded
itself
until
it
lost
its
charm
and
i
banished
it
from
my
mind
as
something
troublesome
the
chief
points
however
of
what
i
owed
to
my
study
of
spinoza
so
far
as
they
have
remained
indelibly
impressed
on
my
mind
and
have
exercised
a
great
influence
on
the
subsequent
course
of
my
life
i
will
now
unfold
as
briefly
and
succinctly
as
possible
influence
of
spinoza
nature
works
after
such
eternal
necessary
dime
laws
that
the
deity
himself
could
alter
nothing
in
them
in
this
belief
all
men
are
unconsciously
agreed
think
only
how
a
natural
phenomenon
which
should
intimate
any
degree
of
understanding
reason
or
even
of
caprice
would
instantly
astonish
and
terrify
us
if
anything
like
reason
shows
itself
in
brutes
it
is
long
before
we
can
recover
from
our
amazement
for
although
they
stand
so
near
to
us
they
nevertheless
seem
to
be
divided
from
us
by
an
infinite
gulf
and
to
belong
altogether
to
the
kingdom
of
necessity
it
is
therefore
impossible
to
take
it
ill
if
some
thinkers
have
pronounced
the
infinitely
ingenious
but
strictly
limited
organisation
of
those
creatures
to
be
thoroughly
mechanical
if
we
turn
to
plants
our
position
is
still
more
strikingly
confirmed
how
unaccountable
is
the
feeling
which
seizes
an
observer
upon
seeing
the
as
soon
as
it
is
touched
fold
together
in
pairs
its
downy
leaves
and
finally
clap
down
its
little
stalk
as
if
upon
a
joint
still
higher
rises
that
feeling
to
which
i
will
give
no
name
at
the
sight
of
the
which
without
any
apparent
outward
occasion
moves
up
and
down
its
little
leaves
and
seems
to
play
with
itself
as
with
our
thoughts
let
us
imagine
a
suddenly
endowed
with
a
similar
capacity
so
that
of
itself
it
could
by
turns
let
down
and
lift
up
again
its
huge
leafy
canopy
who
would
not
upon
seeing
it
the
first
time
start
back
in
terror
so
rooted
within
us
is
the
idea
of
our
own
superiority
that
we
absolutely
refuse
to
concede
to
the
outward
world
any
part
or
portion
in
it
nay
if
we
could
we
would
too
often
withhold
such
advantages
from
our
fellows
on
the
other
hand
a
similar
horror
seizes
upon
us
when
we
see
a
man
unreasonably
opposing
universally
recognised
moral
laws
or
unwisely
acting
against
the
interest
of
himself
and
others
to
get
rid
of
the
repugnance
which
we
feel
on
such
occasions
we
convert
it
at
once
into
censure
or
detestation
and
we
seek
either
in
reality
or
in
thought
to
get
free
from
such
a
man
this
contrariety
between
reason
and
necessity
which
spinoza
threw
out
in
so
strong
a
light
i
strangely
enough
applied
to
my
own
being
and
what
has
been
said
is
properly
speaking
only
for
the
purpose
of
rendering
intelligible
what
follows
i
had
come
to
look
upon
my
indwelling
poetic
talent
altogether
as
nature
the
more
so
as
i
had
always
been
impelled
to
regard
outward
nature
as
its
proper
object
the
exercise
of
this
poetic
gift
could
indeed
be
excited
and
determined
by
circumstances
but
its
most
joyful
its
richest
action
was
even
involuntary
through
field
and
forest
roaming
my
little
songs
still
humming
so
went
it
all
day
long
in
my
nightly
vigils
the
same
thing
happened
i
therefore
often
wished
like
one
of
my
predecessors
to
get
me
a
leathern
jerkin
made
and
to
accustom
myself
to
write
in
the
dark
so
as
to
be
able
to
fix
down
at
once
all
such
unpremeditated
effusions
so
frequently
had
it
happened
that
after
composing
a
little
piece
in
my
head
i
could
not
recall
it
that
i
would
now
hurry
to
the
desk
and
at
one
standing
write
off
the
poem
from
beginning
to
end
and
as
i
could
not
spare
time
to
adjust
my
paper
however
obliquely
it
might
lie
the
lines
often
crossed
it
diagonally
in
such
a
mood
i
liked
best
to
get
hold
of
a
lead
pencil
because
i
could
write
most
readily
with
it
whereas
the
scratching
and
spluttering
of
the
pen
would
sometimes
wake
me
from
my
somnambular
poetizing
confuse
me
and
stifle
a
little
conception
in
its
birth
for
the
poems
thus
created
i
had
a
particular
reverence
for
i
felt
towards
them
somewhat
as
the
hen
does
towards
her
chickens
which
she
sees
hatched
and
chirping
about
her
my
old
whim
of
making
known
these
things
only
by
means
of
private
readings
now
returned
to
me
to
exchange
them
for
money
seemed
to
me
detestable
himburg
the
piratical
bookseller
and
this
suggests
to
me
to
mention
in
the
present
place
a
little
incident
which
however
did
not
take
place
till
some
time
after
when
the
demand
for
my
works
had
increased
and
a
collected
edition
of
them
was
much
called
for
these
feelings
held
me
back
from
preparing
it
myself
himburg
however
took
advantage
of
my
hesitation
and
i
unexpectedly
received
one
day
several
copies
of
my
collected
works
in
print
with
cool
audacity
this
unauthorized
publisher
even
boasted
of
having
done
me
a
public
service
and
offered
to
send
me
if
i
wished
some
berlin
porcelain
by
way
of
compensation
his
offer
served
to
remind
me
of
the
law
which
compelled
the
jews
of
berlin
when
they
married
to
purchase
a
certain
quantity
of
porcelain
in
order
to
keep
up
the
sale
of
the
royal
manufacture
the
contempt
which
was
shewn
for
the
shameless
pirate
led
me
to
suppress
the
indignation
which
i
could
not
but
feel
at
such
a
robbery
i
gave
him
no
reply
and
while
he
was
making
himself
very
comfortable
with
my
property
i
revenged
myself
in
silence
with
the
following
verses
records
of
the
years
once
dream
away
long
fallen
hairs
and
that
shew
decay
faded
ribbons
veils
so
lightly
wove
the
mournful
pledges
of
a
vanished
love
things
that
to
the
flames
should
long
have
gone
saucy
sosias
snatches
every
one
just
as
though
he
were
the
heir
to
claim
lawfully
the
poets
works
and
fame
and
to
make
the
owner
full
amends
paltry
tea
and
he
sends
take
your
china
back
your
gingerbread
for
all
himburgs
living
i
am
dead
this
very
nature
however
which
thus
spontaneously
brought
forth
so
many
longer
and
smaller
works
was
subject
to
long
pauses
and
for
considerable
periods
i
was
unable
even
when
i
most
wished
it
to
produce
anything
and
consequently
often
suffered
from
ennui
the
perception
of
such
contrasts
within
me
gave
rise
to
the
thought
whether
on
the
other
hand
it
would
not
be
my
wisest
course
to
employ
for
my
own
and
others
profit
and
advantage
the
human
rational
and
intellectual
part
of
my
being
and
as
i
already
had
done
and
as
i
now
felt
myself
more
and
more
called
upon
to
do
devote
the
intervals
when
nature
ceased
to
influence
me
to
worldly
occupations
and
thus
to
leave
no
one
of
my
faculties
unused
this
course
which
seemed
to
be
dictated
by
those
general
ideas
before
described
was
so
much
in
harmony
with
my
character
and
my
position
in
life
that
i
resolved
to
adopt
it
and
by
this
means
to
check
the
wavering
and
hesitation
to
which
i
had
hitherto
been
subject
very
pleasant
was
it
to
me
to
reflect
that
thus
for
actual
service
to
my
fellow
men
i
might
demand
a
substantial
reward
while
on
the
other
hand
i
might
go
on
disinterestedly
spending
that
lovely
gift
of
nature
as
a
sacred
thing
by
this
consideration
i
guarded
against
the
bitterness
of
feeling
which
might
have
arisen
when
circumstances
should
force
upon
the
remark
that
precisely
this
talent
so
courted
and
admired
in
germany
was
treated
as
altogether
beyond
the
pale
of
the
law
and
of
justice
for
not
only
were
piracies
considered
perfectly
allowable
and
even
comical
in
berlin
but
the
estimable
margrave
of
baden
so
praised
for
his
administrative
virtues
and
the
emperor
joseph
who
had
justified
so
many
hopes
lent
their
sanction
one
to
his
macklot
and
the
other
to
his
honorable
noble
and
it
was
declared
that
the
rights
as
well
as
the
property
of
genius
should
be
left
at
the
absolute
mercy
of
the
trade
one
day
when
we
were
complaining
of
this
to
a
visitor
from
baden
he
told
us
the
following
story
her
ladyship
the
margravine
being
a
very
active
lady
had
established
a
but
the
paper
was
so
bad
that
it
was
impossible
to
dispose
of
it
thereupon
bookseller
macklot
proposed
if
he
were
permitted
to
print
the
german
poets
and
prose
writers
he
would
use
this
paper
and
thus
enhance
its
value
the
proposition
was
adopted
with
avidity
of
course
we
pronounced
this
malicious
piece
of
scandal
to
be
a
mere
fabrication
but
found
our
pleasure
in
it
notwithstanding
the
name
of
macklot
became
a
at
the
time
and
was
applied
by
us
to
all
mean
transactions
and
a
versatile
youth
often
reduced
to
borrowing
himself
while
others
meanness
was
making
itself
rich
upon
his
talents
felt
himself
sufficiently
compensated
by
a
couple
of
good
jokes
children
and
youths
wander
on
in
a
sort
of
happy
intoxication
which
betrays
itself
especially
in
the
fact
that
the
good
innocent
creatures
are
scarcely
able
to
notice
and
still
less
to
understand
the
ever
changing
state
of
things
around
them
they
regard
the
world
as
raw
material
which
they
must
shape
as
a
treasure
which
they
must
take
possession
of
everything
they
seem
to
think
belongs
to
them
everything
must
be
subservient
to
their
will
indeed
on
this
account
the
greater
part
lose
themselves
in
a
wild
uncontrollable
temper
with
the
better
part
however
this
tendency
unfolds
itself
into
a
moral
enthusiasm
which
occasionally
moves
of
its
own
accord
after
some
actual
or
seeming
good
but
still
oftener
suffers
itself
to
be
prompted
led
and
even
misled
such
was
the
case
with
the
youth
of
whom
we
are
at
present
speaking
and
if
he
appeared
rather
strange
to
mankind
still
he
seemed
welcome
to
many
at
the
very
first
meeting
you
found
in
him
a
freedom
from
reserve
a
cheerful
in
conversation
and
in
action
the
unpremeditated
suggestions
of
the
moment
of
the
latter
trait
a
story
or
two
a
scene
at
a
fire
in
the
jews
street
a
violent
conflagration
had
broken
out
my
universal
benevolence
which
prompted
me
to
lend
my
active
aid
to
all
led
me
to
the
spot
full
dressed
as
i
was
a
passage
had
been
broken
through
from
all
saints
street
and
thither
i
repaired
i
found
a
great
number
of
men
busied
with
carrying
water
rushing
forward
with
full
buckets
and
back
again
with
empty
ones
i
soon
saw
that
by
forming
a
lane
for
passing
up
and
down
the
buckets
the
help
we
rendered
might
be
doubled
i
seized
two
full
buckets
and
remained
standing
and
called
others
to
me
those
who
came
on
were
relieved
of
their
load
while
those
returning
arranged
themselves
in
a
row
on
the
other
side
the
arrangement
was
applauded
my
address
and
personal
sympathy
found
favor
and
the
lane
unbroken
from
its
commencement
to
its
burning
goal
was
soon
completed
scarcely
however
had
the
cheerfulness
which
this
inspired
called
forth
a
joyous
i
might
even
say
a
merry
humor
in
this
living
machine
all
of
whose
party
worked
well
together
when
wantonness
began
to
appear
and
was
soon
succeeded
by
a
love
of
mischief
the
wretched
fugitives
dragging
off
their
miserable
substance
upon
their
backs
if
they
once
got
within
the
lane
must
pass
on
without
stopping
and
if
they
ventured
to
halt
for
a
moment
rest
were
immediately
assailed
saucy
boys
would
sprinkle
them
with
the
water
and
even
add
insult
to
misery
however
by
means
of
gentle
words
and
eloquent
reproofs
prompted
perhaps
by
a
regard
to
my
best
clothes
which
were
in
danger
i
managed
to
put
a
stop
to
their
rudeness
some
of
my
friends
had
from
curiosity
approached
to
gaze
on
the
calamity
and
seemed
astonished
to
see
their
companion
in
thin
shoes
and
silk
stockings
for
that
was
then
the
in
this
wet
business
but
few
of
them
could
i
persuade
to
join
us
the
others
laughed
and
shook
their
heads
we
stood
our
ground
however
a
long
while
for
if
any
were
tired
and
went
away
there
were
plenty
ready
to
take
their
places
many
too
came
merely
for
the
sake
of
the
spectacle
and
so
my
innocent
daring
became
universally
known
and
the
strange
disregard
of
etiquette
became
the
of
the
day
this
readiness
to
do
any
action
that
a
whim
might
prompt
which
proceeded
from
a
happy
which
men
are
apt
to
blame
as
vanity
made
our
friend
to
be
talked
of
for
other
oddities
a
very
inclement
winter
had
completely
covered
the
main
with
ice
and
converted
it
into
a
solid
floor
the
liveliest
intercourse
both
for
business
and
pleasure
was
kept
up
on
the
ice
boundless
and
wide
smooth
frozen
plains
swarmed
with
a
moving
multitude
i
never
failed
to
be
there
early
in
the
morning
and
once
being
lightly
clad
felt
myself
nearly
frozen
through
by
the
time
that
my
mother
arrived
who
usually
came
at
a
later
hour
to
visit
the
scene
she
sat
in
the
carriage
in
her
and
cloak
which
held
together
on
her
breast
by
a
strong
golden
cord
and
tassel
looked
quite
fine
give
me
your
furs
dear
mother
i
cried
out
on
the
instant
without
a
moment
thought
i
am
terribly
frozen
she
too
did
not
stop
to
think
and
so
in
a
moment
i
was
wrapped
in
her
cloak
beaching
below
my
knees
with
its
and
gold
trimmings
it
contrasted
not
badly
with
the
brown
fur
cap
i
wore
thus
clad
i
carelessly
went
on
skating
up
and
down
the
crowd
was
so
great
that
no
especial
notice
was
taken
of
my
strange
appearance
still
it
was
not
unobserved
for
often
afterwards
it
was
brought
up
in
jest
or
in
earnest
among
my
other
eccentricities
leaving
these
recollections
of
happy
and
spontaneous
action
we
will
now
resume
the
sober
thread
of
our
narrative
a
witty
frenchman
has
said
if
a
clever
man
has
once
attracted
the
attention
of
the
public
by
any
meritorious
work
every
one
does
his
best
to
prevent
his
ever
doing
a
similar
thing
again
it
is
even
so
something
good
and
spirited
is
produced
in
the
quiet
seclusion
of
youth
applause
is
won
but
independence
is
lost
the
concentrated
talent
is
pulled
about
and
distracted
because
people
think
that
they
may
pluck
off
and
appropriate
to
themselves
a
portion
of
the
personality
it
was
owing
to
this
that
i
received
a
great
many
invitations
or
rather
not
exactly
invitations
a
mend
an
acquaintance
would
propose
with
even
more
than
urgency
to
introduce
me
here
or
there
the
stranger
now
described
as
a
bear
on
account
of
his
frequent
surly
refusals
and
then
again
like
voltaire
huron
or
cumberland
west
indian
as
a
child
of
nature
in
spite
of
many
talents
excited
curiosity
and
in
various
families
negotiations
were
set
on
foot
to
see
him
introduction
to
lili
among
others
a
friend
one
evening
entreated
me
to
go
with
him
to
a
little
concert
to
be
given
in
the
house
of
an
eminent
merchant
of
the
reformed
persuasion
it
was
already
late
but
as
i
loved
to
do
everything
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
went
with
him
decently
dressed
as
usual
we
entered
a
chamber
on
the
ground
floor
the
ordinary
but
spacious
of
the
family
the
company
was
numerous
a
piano
stood
in
the
middle
at
which
the
only
daughter
of
the
house
sat
down
immediately
and
played
with
considerable
facility
and
grace
i
stood
at
the
lower
end
of
the
piano
that
i
might
be
near
enough
to
observe
her
form
and
bearing
there
was
something
childlike
in
her
manner
the
movements
she
was
obliged
to
make
in
playing
were
unconstrained
and
easy
after
the
sonata
was
finished
she
stepped
towards
the
end
of
the
piano
to
meet
me
we
merely
saluted
however
without
further
conversation
for
a
quartet
had
already
commenced
at
the
close
of
it
i
moved
somewhat
nearer
and
uttered
some
civil
compliment
telling
her
what
pleasure
it
gave
me
that
my
first
acquaintance
with
her
should
have
also
made
me
acquainted
with
her
talent
she
managed
to
make
a
very
clever
reply
and
kept
her
position
as
i
did
mine
i
saw
that
she
observed
me
closely
and
that
i
was
really
standing
for
a
show
but
i
took
it
all
in
good
part
since
i
had
something
graceful
to
look
at
in
my
turn
meanwhile
we
gazed
on
one
another
and
i
will
not
deny
that
i
was
sensible
of
feeling
an
attractive
power
of
the
gentlest
kind
the
moving
about
of
the
company
and
her
performances
prevented
any
further
approach
that
evening
but
i
must
confess
that
i
was
anything
but
displeased
when
on
taking
leave
the
mother
gave
me
to
understand
that
they
hoped
soon
to
see
me
again
while
the
daughter
seemed
to
join
in
the
request
with
some
friendliness
of
manner
i
did
not
fail
at
suitable
intervals
to
repeat
my
visit
since
on
such
occasions
i
was
sure
of
a
cheerful
and
intellectual
conversation
which
seemed
to
prophesy
no
tie
of
passion
in
the
meantime
the
hospitality
of
our
house
once
laid
open
caused
many
an
inconvenience
to
my
good
parents
and
myself
at
any
rate
it
had
not
proved
in
any
way
beneficial
to
my
steadfast
desire
to
notice
the
higher
to
study
it
to
further
it
and
if
possible
to
imitate
it
men
i
saw
so
far
as
they
were
good
were
pious
and
so
far
as
they
were
active
were
unwise
and
oftentimes
unapt
the
former
could
not
help
me
and
the
latter
only
confused
me
one
remarkable
case
i
have
carefully
written
down
jung
or
stilling
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
jung
afterwards
called
stilling
from
the
lower
rhine
announced
to
us
that
he
was
coming
to
frankfort
being
invited
as
an
oculist
to
treat
an
important
case
the
news
was
welcome
to
my
parents
and
myself
and
we
offered
him
quarters
herr
von
lersner
a
worthy
man
advanced
in
years
universally
esteemed
for
his
success
in
the
education
and
training
of
princely
children
and
for
his
intelligent
manners
at
court
and
on
his
travels
had
been
long
afflicted
with
total
blindness
his
strong
hope
of
obtaining
some
relief
of
his
affliction
was
not
entirely
extinct
now
for
several
years
past
jung
with
much
courage
and
modest
boldness
had
in
the
lower
rhine
successfully
couched
for
the
cataract
and
thus
had
gained
a
reputation
the
candor
of
his
soul
his
truth
fulness
of
character
and
genuine
piety
gained
him
universal
confidence
this
extended
up
the
river
through
the
medium
of
various
parties
connected
by
business
herr
von
lersner
and
his
friends
upon
the
advice
of
an
intelligent
physician
resolved
to
send
for
the
successful
oculist
although
a
frankfort
merchant
in
whose
case
the
cure
had
failed
earnestly
endeavored
to
dissuade
them
but
what
was
a
single
failure
against
so
many
successful
cases
so
jung
came
enticed
by
the
hope
of
a
handsome
remuneration
which
heretofore
he
had
been
accustomed
to
renounce
he
came
to
increase
his
imputation
full
of
confidence
and
in
high
spirits
and
we
congratulated
ourselves
on
the
prospect
of
such
an
excellent
and
lively
at
last
after
a
preparatory
course
of
medicine
the
cataract
upon
both
eyes
was
couched
expectation
was
at
its
height
it
was
said
that
the
patient
saw
the
moment
after
the
operation
until
the
bandage
again
shut
out
the
light
but
it
was
remarked
that
jung
was
not
cheerful
and
that
something
weighed
on
his
spirits
indeed
on
further
inquiry
he
confessed
to
me
that
he
was
uneasy
as
to
the
result
of
the
operation
commonly
for
i
had
witnessed
several
operations
of
the
kind
in
strasburg
nothing
in
the
world
seemed
easier
than
such
cases
and
stilling
himself
had
operated
successfully
a
hundred
times
after
piercing
the
insensible
cornea
which
gave
no
pain
the
dull
lens
would
at
the
slightest
pressure
spring
forward
of
itself
the
patient
immediately
discerned
objects
and
only
had
to
wait
with
bandaged
eyes
until
the
completed
cure
should
allow
him
to
use
the
precious
organ
at
his
own
will
and
convenience
how
many
a
poor
man
for
whom
jung
had
procured
this
happiness
had
invoked
god
blessing
and
reward
upon
his
benefactor
which
was
now
to
be
realized
by
means
of
this
wealthy
patient
jung
confessed
to
me
that
this
time
the
operation
had
not
gone
off
so
easily
and
so
successfully
the
lens
had
not
sprung
forward
he
had
been
obliged
to
draw
it
out
and
indeed
as
it
had
grown
to
the
socket
to
loosen
it
and
this
he
was
not
able
to
do
without
violence
he
now
reproached
himself
for
having
operated
also
on
the
other
eye
but
lersner
and
his
friends
had
firmly
resolved
to
have
both
couched
at
the
same
time
and
when
the
emergency
occurred
they
did
not
immediately
recover
presence
of
mind
enough
to
think
what
was
best
suffice
it
to
say
the
second
lens
also
did
not
spontaneously
spring
forward
but
had
to
be
loosened
and
drawn
out
with
difficulty
how
much
pain
our
benevolent
pious
friend
felt
in
this
case
it
is
impossible
to
describe
or
to
unfold
some
general
observations
on
his
state
of
mind
will
not
be
out
of
place
here
to
labor
for
his
own
moral
culture
is
the
simplest
and
most
practicable
thing
which
man
can
propose
to
himself
the
impulse
is
inborn
in
him
while
in
social
life
both
reason
and
love
prompt
or
rather
force
him
to
do
so
stilling
could
only
live
in
a
moral
religious
atmosphere
of
love
without
sympathy
without
hearty
response
he
could
not
exist
he
demanded
mutual
attachment
where
he
was
not
known
he
was
silent
where
he
was
only
known
not
loved
he
was
sad
accordingly
he
got
on
best
with
those
persons
who
can
set
themselves
down
for
life
in
their
assigned
vocation
and
go
to
work
to
perfect
themselves
in
their
narrow
but
peaceful
sphere
such
persons
succeed
pretty
well
in
stifling
vanity
in
renouncing
the
pursuit
of
outward
power
in
acquiring
a
circumspect
way
of
speaking
and
in
preserving
a
uniformly
friendly
manner
towards
companions
and
neighbors
frequently
we
may
observe
in
this
class
traces
of
a
certain
form
of
mental
character
modified
by
individual
varieties
such
persons
accidentally
excited
attach
great
weight
to
the
course
of
their
experience
they
consider
everything
a
supernatural
determination
in
the
conviction
that
god
interferes
immediately
with
the
course
of
the
world
with
all
this
there
is
associated
a
certain
disposition
to
abide
in
his
present
state
and
yet
at
the
same
time
to
allow
themselves
to
be
pushed
or
led
on
which
results
from
a
certain
indecision
to
act
of
themselves
the
latter
is
increased
by
the
miscarriage
of
the
wisest
plans
as
well
as
by
the
accidental
success
brought
about
by
the
unforeseen
concurrence
of
favorable
occurrences
now
since
a
vigilant
manly
character
is
much
checked
by
this
way
of
life
it
is
well
worthy
of
reflection
and
inquiry
how
men
are
most
liable
to
fall
into
such
a
state
the
things
sympathetic
persons
of
this
kind
love
most
to
talk
of
are
the
awakenings
and
conversions
to
which
we
will
not
deny
a
certain
psychological
value
they
are
properly
what
we
call
in
scientific
and
poetic
matters
an
the
perception
of
a
great
maxim
which
is
always
a
operation
of
the
mind
we
arrive
at
it
by
pure
intuition
that
is
by
reflection
neither
by
learning
or
tradition
in
the
cases
before
us
it
is
the
perception
of
the
moral
power
which
anchors
in
faith
and
thus
feels
itself
in
proud
security
in
the
midst
of
the
waves
such
an
gives
the
discoverer
the
greatest
joy
because
in
an
original
manner
it
points
to
the
infinite
it
requires
no
length
of
time
to
work
conviction
it
leaps
forth
whole
and
complete
in
a
moment
hence
the
quaint
old
french
rhyme
en
peu
dieu
labeure
outward
occasions
often
work
violently
in
bringing
about
such
conversions
and
then
people
think
they
see
in
them
signs
and
wonders
stilling
love
and
confidence
bound
me
most
heartily
to
stilling
i
had
moreover
exercised
a
good
and
happy
influence
on
his
life
and
it
was
quite
in
accordance
with
his
disposition
to
treasure
up
in
a
tender
grateful
heart
the
remembrance
of
all
that
had
ever
been
done
for
him
but
in
my
existing
frame
of
mind
and
pursuits
his
society
neither
benefited
nor
cheered
me
i
was
glad
to
let
every
one
interpret
as
he
pleased
and
work
out
the
riddle
of
his
days
but
this
way
of
ascribing
to
ail
immediate
divine
influence
all
the
good
that
after
a
rational
manner
occurs
to
us
in
our
chanceful
life
seemed
to
me
too
presumptuous
and
the
habit
of
regarding
the
painful
consequences
of
the
hasty
acts
and
omissions
of
our
own
thoughtlessness
or
conceit
as
a
dime
chastisement
did
not
at
all
suit
me
i
could
therefore
only
listen
to
my
good
friend
but
could
not
give
him
any
very
encouraging
reply
still
i
readily
suffered
him
like
so
many
others
to
go
his
own
way
and
defended
him
since
then
as
well
as
before
when
others
of
too
worldly
a
mind
did
not
hesitate
to
wound
his
gentle
nature
thus
i
never
allowed
a
roguish
remark
to
come
to
his
ears
made
by
a
waggish
man
who
once
very
earnestly
exclaimed
no
indeed
if
i
were
as
intimate
with
god
as
jung
is
i
would
never
pray
to
the
most
high
for
gold
but
for
wisdom
and
good
counsel
that
i
might
not
make
so
many
blunders
which
cost
money
and
draw
after
them
wretched
years
of
debt
in
truth
it
was
no
time
for
such
jests
between
hope
and
fear
several
more
days
passed
away
with
him
the
latter
grew
the
former
waned
and
at
last
vanished
altogether
the
eyes
of
the
good
patient
man
had
become
inflamed
and
there
remained
no
doubt
that
the
operation
had
failed
the
state
of
mind
to
which
our
friend
was
reduced
hereby
is
not
to
be
described
he
was
struggling
against
the
deepest
and
worst
kind
of
despair
for
what
was
there
now
that
he
had
not
lost
in
the
first
place
the
warm
thanks
of
one
restored
to
sight
the
noblest
reward
which
a
physician
can
enjoy
then
the
confidence
of
others
similarly
needing
help
then
his
worldly
credit
while
the
interruption
of
his
peculiar
practice
would
reduce
his
family
to
a
helpless
state
in
short
we
played
the
mournful
drama
of
job
through
from
beginning
to
end
since
the
faithful
jung
took
himself
the
part
of
the
reproving
friends
he
chose
to
regard
this
calamity
as
the
punishment
of
his
former
faults
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
taking
his
accidental
discovery
of
an
as
a
divine
call
to
that
business
he
had
acted
wickedly
and
profanely
he
reproached
himself
for
not
having
thoroughly
studied
this
highly
important
department
instead
of
lightly
trusting
his
cures
to
good
fortune
what
his
enemies
had
said
of
him
recurred
again
to
his
mind
he
began
to
doubt
whether
perhaps
it
was
not
all
true
and
it
pained
him
the
more
deeply
when
he
found
that
in
the
course
of
his
life
he
had
been
guilty
of
that
levity
which
is
so
dangerous
to
pious
men
and
also
of
presumption
and
vanity
in
such
moments
he
lost
himself
and
in
whatever
light
we
might
endeavour
to
set
the
matter
we
at
last
elicited
from
him
only
the
rational
and
necessary
conclusion
that
the
ways
of
god
are
unsearchable
my
unceasing
efforts
to
be
cheerful
would
have
been
more
checked
by
jung
visit
if
i
had
not
according
to
my
usual
habit
subjected
his
state
of
mind
to
an
earnest
friendly
examination
and
explained
it
after
my
own
fashion
it
vexed
me
not
a
little
to
see
my
good
mother
so
poorly
rewarded
for
her
domestic
care
and
though
she
did
not
herself
perceive
it
with
her
usual
equanimity
and
ever
bustling
activity
i
was
most
pained
for
my
father
on
my
account
he
with
a
good
grace
had
enlarged
what
hitherto
had
been
a
strictly
close
and
private
circle
and
at
table
especially
where
the
presence
of
strangers
attracted
familiar
friends
and
even
passing
visitors
he
liked
to
indulge
in
a
merry
even
paradoxical
conversation
in
which
i
put
him
in
good
humor
and
drew
from
him
many
an
approving
smile
by
all
sorts
of
dialectic
pugilism
for
i
had
an
ungodly
way
of
disputing
everything
which
however
i
pertinaciously
kept
up
in
every
case
so
long
only
as
he
who
maintained
the
right
was
not
yet
made
perfectly
ridiculous
during
the
last
few
weeks
however
this
procedure
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
many
very
happy
and
most
cheering
incidents
occasioned
by
some
successful
secondary
cures
on
the
part
of
our
friend
who
had
been
made
so
miserable
by
the
failure
of
his
principal
attempt
did
not
affect
him
much
less
did
they
give
his
gloomy
mood
another
turn
stilling
jew
patient
one
incident
in
particular
was
most
amusing
among
jung
patients
there
was
a
blind
old
jewish
beggar
who
had
come
from
isenburg
to
frankfort
where
in
the
extremity
of
wretchedness
he
scarcely
found
a
shelter
scarcely
the
meanest
food
and
attendance
nevertheless
his
tough
oriental
nature
helped
him
through
and
he
was
in
raptures
to
find
himself
healed
perfectly
and
without
the
least
suffering
when
asked
if
the
operation
pained
him
he
said
in
his
hyperbolical
manner
if
i
had
a
million
eyes
i
would
let
them
all
be
operated
upon
one
after
the
other
for
half
a
on
his
departure
he
acted
quite
as
eccentrically
in
the
or
main
thoroughfare
he
thanked
god
and
in
good
old
testament
style
praised
the
lord
and
the
wondrous
man
whom
he
had
sent
shouting
this
he
walked
slowly
on
through
the
long
busy
street
towards
the
bridge
buyers
and
sellers
ran
out
of
the
shops
surprised
by
this
singular
exhibition
of
pious
enthusiasm
passionately
venting
itself
before
all
the
world
and
he
excited
their
sympathy
to
such
a
degree
that
without
asking
anything
he
was
amply
furnished
with
gifts
for
his
travelling
expenses
this
lively
incident
however
could
hardly
be
mentioned
in
our
circle
for
though
the
poor
wretch
with
all
his
domestic
misery
in
his
sandy
home
beyond
the
main
could
still
be
counted
extremely
happy
the
man
of
wealth
and
dignity
on
this
side
of
the
river
for
whom
we
were
most
interested
had
missed
the
priceless
relief
so
confidently
expected
it
was
sickening
therefore
to
our
good
jung
to
receive
the
thousand
guilders
which
being
stipulated
in
any
case
were
honorably
paid
by
the
sufferer
this
ready
money
was
destined
to
liquidate
on
his
return
a
portion
of
the
debts
which
added
their
burden
to
other
sad
and
unhappy
circumstances
and
so
he
went
off
inconsolable
for
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
his
meeting
with
his
wife
the
changed
manner
of
her
parents
who
as
sureties
for
so
many
debts
of
this
too
confiding
man
might
however
consider
they
had
made
a
great
mistake
in
the
choice
of
a
partner
for
their
daughter
in
this
and
that
house
from
this
and
that
window
he
could
already
see
the
scornful
and
contemptuous
looks
of
those
who
even
when
he
was
prospering
had
wished
him
no
good
while
the
thought
of
a
practice
interrupted
by
his
absence
and
likely
to
be
materially
damaged
by
his
failure
troubled
him
extremely
and
so
we
took
our
leave
of
him
not
without
all
hope
on
our
parts
for
his
strong
nature
sustained
by
faith
in
supernatural
aid
could
not
but
inspire
his
friends
with
a
quiet
and
moderate
confidence
a

with
the
head
of
the

worth
good
seventeenth
book
in
resuming
the
history
of
my
relation
to
i
have
to
mention
the
many
very
pleasant
hours
i
spent
in
her
society
partly
in
the
presence
of
her
mother
partly
alone
with
her
on
the
strength
of
my
writings
people
gave
me
credit
for
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
as
it
was
then
called
and
in
this
view
our
conversations
were
morally
interesting
in
every
way
but
how
could
we
talk
of
such
inward
matters
without
coming
to
mutual
disclosures
it
was
not
long
before
in
a
quiet
hour
lili
told
me
the
history
of
her
youth
she
had
grown
up
in
the
enjoyment
of
all
the
advantages
of
society
and
worldly
comforts
she
described
to
me
her
brothers
her
relations
and
all
her
nearest
connexions
only
her
mother
was
kept
in
a
respectful
obscurity
little
weaknesses
too
were
thought
of
and
among
them
she
could
not
deny
that
she
had
often
remarked
in
herself
a
certain
gift
of
attracting
others
with
which
at
the
same
time
was
united
a
certain
peculiarity
of
letting
them
go
again
by
prattling
on
we
thus
came
at
last
to
the
important
point
that
she
had
exercised
this
gift
upon
me
too
but
had
been
punished
for
it
since
she
had
been
attracted
by
me
also
these
confessions
flowed
forth
from
so
pure
and
childlike
a
nature
that
by
them
she
made
me
entirely
her
own
we
were
now
necessary
to
each
other
we
had
grown
into
the
habit
of
seeing
each
other
but
how
many
a
day
how
many
an
evening
till
far
into
the
night
should
i
have
had
to
deny
myself
her
company
if
i
had
not
reconciled
myself
to
seeing
her
in
her
own
circles
this
was
a
source
of
manifold
pain
to
me
my
relation
to
her
was
that
of
a
character
to
a
character
i
looked
upon
her
as
to
a
beautiful
amiable
highly
accomplished
daughter
it
was
like
my
earlier
attachments
but
was
of
a
still
higher
kind
of
outward
circumstances
however
of
the
interchange
of
social
relations
i
had
never
thought
an
irresistible
longing
reigned
in
me
i
could
not
be
without
her
nor
she
without
me
but
from
the
circle
which
surrounded
her
and
through
the
interference
of
its
individual
members
how
many
days
were
spoiled
how
many
hours
wasted
the
history
of
pleasure
parties
which
ended
in
displeasure
a
retarding
brother
whom
i
was
to
accompany
who
would
however
always
be
stopping
to
do
some
business
or
other
which
perhaps
somewhat
maliciously
he
was
in
no
hurry
to
finish
and
would
thereby
spoil
the
whole
plan
for
a
meeting
and
ever
so
much
more
of
accident
and
disappointment
of
impatience
and
privation
all
these
little
troubles
which
circumstantially
set
forth
in
a
romance
would
certainly
find
sympathizing
readers
i
must
here
omit
however
to
bring
this
merely
contemplative
account
nearer
to
a
living
experience
to
a
youthful
sympathy
i
may
insert
some
songs
which
are
indeed
well
known
but
are
perhaps
especially
impressive
in
this
place
heart
my
heart
o
what
hath
changed
thee
what
doth
weigh
on
thee
so
sore
what
hath
from
myself
estranged
thee
that
i
scarcely
know
thee
more
gone
is
all
which
once
seemed
dearest
gone

care
which
once
was

how

that

so

thee
with
resistless
charm
if
i
swear
no
more
to
see
her
if
i
man
myself
and
flee
her
soon
i
find
my
efforts
vain
forc
to
seek
her
once
again
she
with
magic
thread
has
bound
me
that
defies
my
strength
or
skill
she
has
drawn
a
circle
round
me
holds
me
fast
against

i
must
live
as
she

ah
how

the
change
to

when
wilt
thou
set
mo
free
with

power
why
dost
thou
press
me
into
scenes
so
bright
had
i
not
good
youth
so
much
to
bless
me
in
the
lonely
night
in
my
little
chamber
close
i
found
me
in
the
moon
cold
beams
and
their
quivering
light
fell
softly
round
me
while
i
lay
in
dreams
and
by
hours
of
pure
unmingled
pleasure
all
my
dreams
were
blest
while
i
felt
her
image
as
a
treasure
deep
within
my
breast
is
it
i
she
at
the
table
places
so
many
lights
yes
to
meet
intolerable
faces
she
her
slave
invites
ah
the
spring

fields
no
longer
cheer
me
flowers
no
sweetness

where
thou
art

and

whoever
reads
these
songs
attentively
to
himself
or
better
still
sings
them
with
feeling
will
certainly
feel
a
breath
of
the
fulness
of
those
happy
hours
stealing
over
him
but
we
will
not
take
leave
of
that
greater
and
more
brilliant
society
without
adding
some
further
remarks
especially
to
explain
the
close
of
the
second
poem
lili
soirées
she
whom
i
was
only
accustomed
to
see
in
a
simple
dress
which
was
seldom
changed
now
stood
before
me
on
such
occasions
in
all
the
splendor
of
elegant
fashion
and
still
she
was
the
same
her
usual
grace
and
kindliness
of
manner
remained
only
i
should
say
her
gift
of
attracting
shone
more
conspicuous
perhaps
because
brought
into
contact
with
several
persons
she
seemed
called
upon
to
express
herself
with
more
animation
and
to
exhibit
herself
on
more
sides
as
various
characters
approached
her
at
any
rate
i
could
not
deny
on
the
one
hand
that
these
strangers
were
annoying
to
me
while
on
the
other
i
would
not
for
a
great
deal
have
deprived
myself
of
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
her
talents
for
society
and
of
seeing
that
she
was
made
for
a
wider
and
more
general
sphere
though
covered
with
ornaments
it
was
still
the
same
bosom
that
had
opened
to
me
its
inmost
secrets
and
into
which
i
could
look
as
clearly
as
into
my
own
they
were
still
the
same
lips
that
had
so
lately
described
to
me
the
state
of
things
amidst
which
she
had
grown
up
and
had
spent
her
early
years
every
look
that
we
interchanged
every
accompanying
smile
bespoke
a
noble
feeling
of
mutual
intelligence
and
i
was
myself
astonished
here
in
the
crowd
at
the
secret
innocent
understanding
which
existed
between
us
in
the
most
human
the
most
natural
way
but
with
returning
spring
the
pleasant
freedom
of
the
country
was
to
knit
still
closer
these
relations
offenbach
on
the
main
showed
even
then
the
considerable
beginnings
of
a
city
which
promised
to
form
itself
in
time

and
for
the
times
splendid

already
erected

a
lively
young

of
amiable
qualities
lived
opposite
contiguous
gardens
and
terraces
reaching
down
to

and
affording
a
free
egress
in
every
direction
into
the
lovely
surrounding

in

humor
the

could
not
find
a
more
desirable
spot
for
indulging
his
feelings
bürger
leonore
i
lived
at
the
house
of
john
andré
and
since
i
am
here
forced
to
mention
this
man
who
afterwards
made
himself
well
enough
known
i
must
indulge
in
a
short
digression
in
order
to
give
some
idea
of
the
state
of
the
opera
at
that
time
in
frankfort
marchand
was
director
of
the
theatre
and
exerted
himself
in
his
own
person
to
do
all
that
was
possible
in
his
best
years
he
had
been
a
fine
large
man
the
easy
and
gentle
qualities
appeared
to
predominate
in
his
character
his
presence
on
the
stage
therefore
was
agreeable
enough
he
had
perhaps
as
much
voice
as
was
required
for
the
execution
of
any
of
the
musical
works
of
that
day
accordingly
he
endeavoured
to
adapt
to
our
stage
the
large
and
smaller
french
operas
the
part
of
the
father
in
gretry
opera
of
beauty
and
the
beast
particularly
suited
him
and
his
acting
was
quite
expressive
in
the
scene
of
the
vision
which
was
contrived
at
the
back
of
the
stage
this
opera
successful
in
its
way
approached
however
the
lofty
style
and
was
calculated
to
excite
the
tenderest
feelings
on
the
other
hand
a
demon
of
realism
had
got
possession
of
the
operas
founded
upon
different
crafts
and
classes
were
brought
out
huntsmen
the
and
i
know
not
what
else
were
produced
andré
chose
the
he
had
written
the
words
himself
and
upon
that
part
of
the
text
which
belonged
to
him
had
lavished
his
whole
musical
talent
i
was
lodging
with
him
and
will
only
say
so
much
as
occasion
demands
of
this
ever
ready
poet
and
composer
he
was
a
man
of
an
innate
lively
talent
and
was
settled
at
offenbach
where
he
properly
carried
on
a
mechanical
business
and
manufacture
he
floated
between
the
or
precentor
and
the
dilettante
in
the
hope
of
meriting
the
former
title
he
toiled
very
earnestly
to
gain
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
science
of
music
in
the
latter
character
he
was
inclined
to
repeat
his
own
compositions
without
end
among
the
persons
who
at
this
time
were
most
active
in
filling
and
enlivening
our
circle
the
pastor
ewald
must
be
first
named
in
society
an
intellectual
agreeable
companion
he
still
carried
on
in
private
quietly
and
diligently
the
studies
of
his
profession
and
in
fact
afterwards
honourably
distinguished
himself
in
the
province
of
theology
ewald
in
short
was
an
indispensable
member
of
our
circle
being
quick
alike
of
comprehension
and
reply
lili
completely
fettered
our
good
andré
to
our
society
what
with
instructing
conducting
and
executing
there
were
few
hours
of
the
day
or
night
in
which
he
was
not
either
in
the
family
circle
or
at
our
social
parties
bürger
leonore
then
but
just
published
and
received
with
enthusiasm
by
the
germans
had
been
set
to
music
by
by
him
this
piece
he
was
always
forward
to
execute
however
often
it
might
be
encored
i
too
who
was
in
the
habit
of
repeating
pieces
of
poetry
with
animation
was
always
ready
to
recite
it
our
friends
at
this
time
did
not
get
weary
of
the
constant
repetition
of
the
same
thing
when
the
company
had
their
choice
which
of
us
they
would
rather
hear
the
decision
was
often
in
my
favour
all
this
however
it
might
be
served
to
prolong
the
intercourse
of
the
lovers
they
knew
no
bounds
and
between
them
both
they
easily
managed
to
keep
the
good
john
andré
continually
in
motion
that
by
repetitions
he
might
make
his
music
last
till
midnight
the
two
lovers
thus
secured
for
themselves
a
precious
and
indispensable
opportunity
if
we
walked
out
early
in
the
morning
we
found
ourselves
in
the
freshest
air
but
not
precisely
in
the
country
imposing
buildings
which
at
that
time
would
have
done
honor
to
a
city
gardens
spreading
before
us
and
easily
overlooked
with
their
smooth
flower
and
ornamental
beds
a
clear
prospect
commanding
the
opposite
banks
of
the
river
over
whose
surface
even
at
an
early
hour
might
be
seen
floating
a
busy
line
of
rafts
or
nimble
and
boats
these
together
formed
a
gently
gliding
living
world
in
harmony
with
tender
feelings
even
the
lonely
rippling
of
the
waves
and
rustling
of
the
reeds
in
a
softly
flowing
stream
was
highly
refreshing
and
never
failed
to
throw
a
decidedly
tranquillising
spell
over
those
who
approached
the
spot
a
clear
sky
of
the
finest
season
of
the
year
overarched
the
whole
and
most
pleasant
was
it
to
renew
morning
after
morning
her
dear
society
in
the
midst
of
such
scenes
should
such
a
mode
of
life
seem
too
irregular
too
trivial
to
the
earnest
reader
let
him
consider
that
between
what
is
here
brought
closely
together
for
the
sake
of
a
convenient
order
there
intervened
whole
days
and
weeks
of
renunciation
other
engagements
and
occupations
and
indeed
an
insupportable
tedium
men
and
women
were
busily
engaged
in
their
spheres
of
duty
i
too
out
of
regard
for
the
present
and
the
future
delayed
not
to
attend
to
all
my
obligations
and
i
found
time
enough
to
finish
that
to
which
my
talent
and
my
passion
irresistibly
impelled
me
the
earliest
hours
of
the
morning
i
devoted
to
poetry
the
middle
of
the
day
was
assigned
to
worldly
business
which
was
handled
in
a
manner
quite
peculiar
my
father
a
thorough
and
indeed
finished
jurist
managed
himself
such
business
as
arose
from
the
care
of
his
own
property
and
a
connexion
with
highly
valued
friends
for
although
his
character
as
imperial
councillor
did
not
allow
him
to
practise
he
was
at
hand
as
legal
adviser
to
many
a
friend
while
the
papers
he
had
prepared
were
signed
by
a
regular
advocate
who
received
a
consideration
for
every
such
signature
this
activity
of
his
had
now
become
more
lively
since
my
return
and
i
could
easily
remark
that
he
prized
my
talent
higher
than
my
practice
and
on
that
account
did
what
he
could
to
leave
me
time
for
my
poetical
studies
and
productions
sound
and
thoroughly
apt
but
slow
of
conception
and
execution
he
studied
the
papers
as
private
and
when
we
came
together
he
would
state
the
case
and
left
me
to
work
it
out
in
which
i
shewed
so
much
readiness
that
he
felt
a
father
purest
joy
and
once
could
not
refrain
from
declaring
that
if
i
were
not
of
his
own
blood
he
should
envy
me
my
worldly
affairs
to
lighten
our
work
we
had
engaged
a
scribe
whose
character
and
individuality
well
worked
out
would
have
helped
to
adorn
a
romance
after
his
which
had
been
profitably
spent
and
in
which
he
had
become
fully
master
of
latin
and
acquired
some
other
useful
branches
of
knowledge
a
dissipated
academic
life
had
brought
trouble
on
the
remainder
of
his
days
he
dragged
on
a
wretched
existence
for
a
time
in
sickness
and
in
poverty
till
at
last
he
contrived
to
improve
his
circumstances
by
the
aid
of
a
fine
and
a
readiness
at
accounts
employed
by
some
advocates
he
gradually
acquired
an
accurate
knowledge
of
the
formalities
of
legal
business
and
by
his
faithfulness
and
punctuality
made
every
one
he
served
his
patron
he
had
been
frequently
employed
by
our
family
and
was
always
at
hand
in
matters
of
law
and
account
he
also
was
an
useful
assistant
in
our
continually
increasing
business
which
consisted
not
only
of
law
matters
but
also
of
various
sorts
of
commissions
orders
and
transit
agencies
in
the
he
knew
all
the
passages
and
windings
in
his
way
he
was
in
tolerable
favor
at
both
burgomasters
audiences
and
since
from
his
first
entrance
into
office
and
even
during
the
times
of
his
equivocal
behaviour
he
had
been
well
acquainted
with
many
of
the
new
senators
some
of
whom
had
quickly
risen
to
the
dignity
of
he
had
acquired
a
certain
confidence
which
might
be
called
a
sort
of
influence
all
this
he
knew
how
to
turn
to
the
advantage
of
his
patrons
and
since
the
state
of
his
health
forced
him
to
limit
his
application
to
writing
he
was
always
found
ready
to
execute
every
commission
or
order
with
care
his
presence
was
not
disagreeable
he
was
slender
in
person
and
of
regular
features
his
manner
was
unobtrusive
though
a
certain
expression
betrayed
his
conviction
that
he
knew
all
what
was
necessary
to
be
done
moreover
he
was
cheerful
and
dexterous
in
clearing
away
difficulties
he
must
have
been
full
forty
and
to
say
the
same
thing
over
again
i
regret
that
i
have
never
introduced
him
as
the
mainspring
in
the
machinery
of
some
novel
hoping
that
my
more
serious
readers
are
now
somewhat
satisfied
by
what
i
have
just
related
i
will
venture
to
turn
again
to
that
bright
point
of
time
when
love
and
friendship
shone
in
their
fairest
light
it
was
in
the
nature
of
such
social
circles
that
all
should
be
carefully
celebrated
with
every
variety
of
rejoicing
it
was
in
honor
of
the
of
the
pastor
ewald
that
the
following
song
was
written
when
met
in
glad
communion
when
warm
by
love
and
wine
to
sing
this
song
in
union
our
voices
we
combine
through
god
who
first
united
together
we
remain
the
flame
which
once
he
lighted
he
now
revives
again
since
this
song
has
been
preserved
until
this
day
and
there
is
scarcely
a
merry
party
at
which
it
is
not
joyfully
revived
we
commend
it
also
to
all
that
shall
come
after
us
and
to
all
who
sing
it
or
recite
it
we
wish
the
same
delight
and
inward
satisfaction
which
we
then
had
when
we
had
no
thought
of
any
wider
world
but
felt
ourselves
a
world
to
ourselves
in
that
narrow
circle
it
will
of
course
be
expected
that
lili
which
on
the
june
returned
for
the
seventeenth
time
was
to
be
celebrated
with
peculiar
honours
she
had
promised
to
come
to
offenbach
at
noon
and
i
must
observe
that
our
friends
with
a
happy
unanimity
had
laid
aside
all
customary
compliments
at
this
festival
and
had
prepared
for
her
reception
and
entertainment
nothing
but
such
heartfelt
tokens
as
were
worthy
of
her
plot
of
she
comes
not
busied
with
such
pleasant
duties
i
saw
the
sun
go
down
announcing
a
bright
day
to
follow
and
promising
its
glad
beaming
presence
at
our
feast
when
lili
brother
george
who
knew
not
how
to
dissemble
came
somewhat
rudely
into
the
chamber
and
without
sparing
our
feelings
gave
us
to
understand
that
intended
festival
was
put
off
he
himself
could
not
tell
how
or
why
but
his
sister
had
bid
him
say
that
it
would
be
wholly
impossible
for
her
to
come
to
offenbach
at
noon
that
day
and
take
part
in
the
intended
festival
she
had
no
hope
of
arriving
before
evening
she
knew
and
felt
most
sensibly
how
vexatious
and
disagreeable
it
must
be
to
me
and
all
her
friends
but
she
begged
me
very
earnestly
to
invent
some
expedient
which
might
soften
and
perhaps
do
away
the
unpleasant
effects
of
this
news
which
she
left
it
to
me
to
announce
if
i
could
she
would
give
me
her
warmest
thanks
i
was
silent
for
a
moment
but
i
quickly
recovered
myself
and
as
if
by
heavenly
inspiration
saw
what
was
to
be
done
make
haste
george
i
cried
tell
her
to
make
herself
easy
and
do
her
best
to
come
towards
evening
i
promise
that
this
very
disappointment
shall
be
turned
into
a
cause
of
rejoicing
the
boy
was
curious
and
wanted
to
know
how
i
refused
to
gratify
his
curiosity
notwithstanding
that
he
called
to
his
aid
all
the
arts
and
all
the
influence
which
a
brother
of
our
beloved
can
presume
to
exercise
no
sooner
had
he
gone
than
i
walked
up
and
down
in
my
chamber
with
a
singular
and
with
the
glad
free
feeling
that
here
was
a
brilliant
opportunity
of
proving
myself
her
devoted
servant
i
stitched
together
several
sheets
of
paper
with
beautiful
silk
as
suited
alone
such
an
occasional
poem
and
hastened
to
write
down
the
title
she
comes
not
a
mournful
family
piece
which
by
the
sore
visitation
of
divine
providence
will
be
represented
in
the
most
natural
manner
on
the
of
june
at
the
action
lasts
from
morning
until
evening
i
have
not
by
me
either
the
original
or
a
copy
of
this
i
have
often
inquired
after
one
but
have
never
been
able
to
get
a
trace
of
it
i
must
therefore
compose
it
anew
a
thing
which
in
the
general
way
is
not
difficult
the
scene
is
at
house
and
garden
in
offenbach
the
action
opens
with
the
domestics
of
whom
each
one
plays
his
special
part
and
evident
preparations
for
a
festival
are
being
made
the
children
drawn
to
the
life
run
in
and
out
among
them
the
master
appears
and
the
mistress
actively
discharging
her
appropriate
functions
then
in
the
midst
of
the
hurry
and
bustle
of
active
preparation
comes
in
neighbour
hans
andré
the
indefatigable
composer
he
seats
himself
at
the
piano
and
calls
them
all
together
to
hear
him
try
his
new
song
which
he
has
just
finished
for
the
festival
he
gathers
round
him
the
whole
house
but
all
soon
disperse
again
to
attend
to
pressing
duties
one
is
called
away
by
another
this
person
wants
the
help
of
that
at
last
the
arrival
of
the
gardener
draws
attention
to
the
preparations
in
the
grounds
and
on
the
water
wreaths
banners
with
ornamental
inscriptions
in
short
nothing
is
forgotten
while
they
are
all
assembled
around
the
most
attractive
objects
in
steps
a
messenger
who
as
a
sort
of
humorous
was
also
entitled
to
play
his
part
and
who
although
he
has
had
plenty
of
could
still
pretty
shrewdly
guess
what
was
the
state
of
the
case
he
sets
a
high
value
on
his
packet
demands
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
wheaten
roll
and
after
some
roguish
hesitation
hands
over
his
despatches
the
master
of
the
house
lets
his
arms
drop
the
papers
fall
to
the
floor
he
calls
out
let
me
go
to
the
table
let
me
go
to
the
bureau
that
i
may
the
spirited
intercourse
of
vivacious
persons
is
chiefly
distinguished
by
a
certain
symbolical
style
of
speech
and
gesture
a
sort
of
conventional
idiom
arises
which
while
it
makes
the
initiated
very
happy
is
unobserved
by
the
stranger
or
if
observed
is
disagreeable
plot
of
she
comes
not
among
lili
most
pleasing
particularities
was
the
one
which
is
here
expressed
by
the
word
brushing
and
which
manifested
itself
whenever
anything
disagreeable
was
said
or
told
especially
when
she
sat
at
table
or
was
near
any
flat
surface
it
had
its
origin
in
a
most
fascinating
but
odd
expedient
which
she
once
had
recourse
to
when
a
stranger
sitting
near
her
at
table
uttered
something
unseemly
without
altering
her
mild
countenance
she
brushed
with
her
right
hand
most
prettily
across
the
and
deliberately
pushed
off
on
to
the
floor
everything
she
reached
with
this
gentle
motion
i
know
not
what
did
not
fall
knives
forks
bread
and
also
something
belonging
to
her
neighbour
every
one
was
startled
the
servants
ran
up
and
no
one
knew
what
it
all
meant
except
the
observing
ones
who
were
delighted
that
she
had
rebuked
and
checked
an
impropriety
in
so
pretty
a
manner
here
now
was
a
symbol
found
to
express
the
repulsion
of
anything
disagreeable
which
still
is
frequently
made
use
of
in
clever
hearty
estimable
and
not
thoroughly
polished
society
we
all
adopted
the
motion
of
the
right
hand
as
a
sign
of
reprobation
the
actual
brushing
away
of
objects
was
a
thing
which
afterwards
she
herself
indulged
in
only
moderately
and
with
good
taste
when
therefore
the
poet
gives
to
the
master
of
the
house
as
a
piece
of
dumb
shew
this
desire
for
brushing
a
habit
which
had
become
with
us
a
second
nature
the
meaning
and
effect
of
the
action
and
its
tendency
are
at
once
apparent
for
while
he
threatens
to
sweep
everything
from
all
flat
surfaces
everybody
tries
to
hinder
him
and
to
pacify
him
till
finally
he
throws
himself
exhausted
on
a
seat
what
has
happened
all
exclaim
is
she
sick
is
any
one
dead
read
read
cries
there
it
lies
on
the
ground
the
despatch
is
picked
up
they
read
it
and
exclaim
comes
not
the
great
terror
had
prepared
them
for
a
greater
but
she
was
had
happened
to
her
no
one
of
the
family
was
hurt
hope
pointed
still
to
the
evening
andré
who
in
the
meanwhile
had
kept
on
with
his
music
came
running
up
at
last
consoling
and
seeking
consolation
pastor
ewald
and
his
wife
likewise
came
in
quite
characteristically
disappointed
and
yet
reasonable
sorry
for
the
disappointment
and
yet
quietly
accepting
all
for
the
best
everything
now
is
at
sixes
and
sevens
until
the
calm
and
exemplary
uncle
bernard
finally
approaches
expecting
a
good
breakfast
and
a
comfortable
dinner
and
he
is
the
only
one
who
sees
the
matter
from
the
right
point
of
view
he
by
reasonable
speeches
sets
all
to
rights
just
as
in
the
greek
tragedy
a
god
manages
with
a
few
words
to
clear
up
the
perplexities
of
the
greatest
heroes
dashed
off
currente
calamo
it
was
yet
late
at
night
before
i
had
finished
it
and
given
it
to
a
messenger
with
instructions
to
deliver
it
the
next
morning
in
offenbach
precisely
at
ten
next
day
when
i
awoke
it
was
one
of
the
brightest
mornings
possible
and
i
set
off
just
in
time
to
arrive
at
offenbach
as
i
purposed
precisely
at
noon
i
was
received
with
the
strangest
charivari
of
salutations
the
interrupted
feast
was
scarcely
mentioned
they
scolded
and
rated
me
because
i
had
taken
them
off
so
well
the
domestics
were
contented
with
being
introduced
on
the
same
stage
with
their
superiors
only
the
children
those
most
decided
and
indomitable
realists
obstinately
insisted
that
they
had
not
talked
so
and
so
that
everything
in
fact
went
quite
differently
from
the
way
in
which
it
there
stood
written
i
appeased
them
by
some
foretastes
of
the
and
they
loved
me
as
much
as
ever
a
cheerful
with
some
though
not
all
of
our
intended
festivities
put
us
in
the
mood
of
receiving
lili
with
less
splendor
but
perhaps
the
more
affectionately
she
came
and
was
welcomed
by
cheerful
nay
merry
faces
surprised
to
find
that
her
staying
away
had
not
marred
all
our
cheerfulness
they
told
her
everything
they
laid
the
whole
thing
before
her
and
she
in
her
dear
sweet
way
thanked
me
as
only
she
could
thank
it
required
no
remarkable
acuteness
to
perceive
that
her
absence
from
the
festival
in
her
honor
was
not
accidental
but
had
been
caused
by
gossiping
about
the
intimacy
between
us
however
this
had
not
the
slightest
influence
either
on
our
sentiments
or
our
behavior
intimacy
with
lili
at
this
season
of
the
year
there
never
failed
to
be
a
varied
throng
of
visitors
from
the
city
frequently
i
did
not
join
the
company
until
late
in
the
evening
when
i
found
her
apparently
sympathizing
and
since
i
commonly
appeared
only
for
a
few
hours
i
was
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
be
useful
to
her
in
any
way
by
attending
to
or
undertaking
some
commission
whether
trifling
or
not
in
her
behalf
and
indeed
this
service
is
the
most
delightful
which
a
man
can
enter
upon
as
the
old
romances
of
chivalry
contrive
how
to
intimate
in
their
obscure
but
powerful
manner
that
she
ruled
over
me
was
not
to
be
concealed
and
this
pride
she
might
well
allow
herself
for
in
this
contest
the
victor
and
the
vanquished
both
triumph
and
enjoy
an
equal
glory
this
my
repeated
though
often
brief
was
always
so
much
the
more
effective
john
andré
had
always
store
of
music
i
contributed
new
pieces
either
by
others
or
myself
so
that
poetical
and
musical
blossoms
showered
down
upon
us
it
was
altogether
a
brilliant
time
a
certain
excitement
reigned
in
the
company
and
there
were
no
insipid
moments
without
further
question
it
seemed
to
be
communicated
to
all
the
rest
for
where
inclination
and
passion
come
out
in
their
own
bold
nature
they
encourage
timid
souls
who
can
not
comprehend
why
they
should
suppress
their
equally
valid
rights
hence
relations
which
hitherto
were
more
or
less
concealed
were
now
seen
to
intertwine
themselves
without
reserve
while
others
which
did
not
confess
themselves
so
openly
still
glided
on
agreeably
in
the
shade
if
because
of
my
multifarious
avocations
i
could
not
pass
whole
days
out
of
doors
with
her
yet
the
clear
evenings
gave
us
opportunity
for
prolonged
meetings
in
the
open
air
loving
souls
will
be
pleased
to
read
the
following
event
ours
was
a
condition
of
which
it
stands
written
i
sleep
but
my
heart
wakes
the
bright
and
the
dark
hours
were
alike
the
light
of
the
day
could
not
outshine
the
light
of
love
and
the
night
was
made
as
the
brightest
day
by
the
radiance
of
passion
one
clear
starlight
evening
we
had
been
walking
about
in
the
open
country
till
it
was
quite
late
and
after
i
had
seen
her
and
her
friends
home
to
their
several
doors
and
finally
had
taken
leave
of
her
i
felt
so
little
inclined
to
sleep
that
i
did
not
hesitate
to
set
off
on
another
ramble
i
took
the
highroad
to
frankfort
giving
myself
up
to
my
thoughts
and
hopes
here
i
seated
myself
on
a
bench
in
the
purest
stillness
of
night
under
the
gleaming
starry
heavens
that
i
might
belong
only
to
myself
and
her
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
sound
quite
near
me
which
i
could
not
explain
it
was
not
a
rattling
nor
a
rustling
noise
and
on
closer
observation
i
discovered
that
it
was
under
the
ground
and
caused
by
the
working
of
some
little
animal
it
might
be
a
or
a
weasel
or
whatever
creature
labors
in
that
way
at
such
hours
having
set
off
again
towards
the
city
and
got
near
to
the
röderberg
i
recognised
by
their
gleam
the
steps
which
lead
up
to
the
vineyards
i
ascended
them
sat
down
and
fell
asleep
when
i
awoke
the
twilight
had
already
dawned
and
i
found
myself
opposite
the
high
wall
which
in
earlier
times
had
been
erected
to
defend
the
heights
on
this
side
saxenhausen
lay
before
me
light
mists
marked
out
the
course
of
the
river
it
was
cool
and
to
me
most
welcome
there
i
waited
till
the
sun
rising
gradually
behind
me
lighted
up
the
opposite
landscape
it
was
the
spot
where
i
was
again
to
see
my
beloved
and
i
returned
slowly
back
to
the
paradise
which
surrounded
her
yet
sleeping
on
account
of
my
increasing
circle
of
business
which
from
love
to
her
i
was
anxious
to
extend
and
to
establish
my
visits
to
offenbach
became
more
rare
and
hence
arose
a
somewhat
painful
predicament
so
that
it
might
well
be
remarked
that
for
the
sake
of
the
future
one
postpones
and
loses
the
present
as
my
prospects
were
now
gradually
improving
i
took
them
to
be
more
promising
than
they
really
were
and
i
thought
the
more
about
coming
to
a
speedy
explanation
since
go
public
an
intimacy
could
not
go
on
much
longer
without
misconstruction
and
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
we
did
not
expressly
say
it
to
one
another
but
the
feeling
of
being
mutually
pleased
in
every
way
the
full
conviction
that
a
separation
was
impossible
the
confidence
reposed
in
one
another
all
this
produced
such
a
seriousness
that
i
who
had
firmly
resolved
never
again
to
get
involved
in
any
troublesome
connexion
of
the
kind
and
who
found
myself
nevertheless
entangled
in
this
without
the
certainty
of
a
favorable
result
was
actually
beset
with
a
heaviness
of
mind
to
get
rid
of
which
i
plunged
more
and
more
in
indifferent
worldly
affairs
from
which
apart
from
my
beloved
i
had
no
care
to
derive
either
profit
or
pleasure
a
betrothal
in
this
strange
situation
the
like
of
which
many
no
doubt
have
with
pain
experienced
there
came
to
our
aid
a
female
friend
of
the
family
who
saw
through
characters
and
situations
very
clearly
she
was
called
mademoiselle
delf
she
presided
with
her
elder
sister
over
a
little
business
in
heidelberg
and
on
several
occasions
had
received
many
favors
from
the
greater
frankfort
she
had
known
and
loved
lili
from
her
youth
she
was
quite
a
peculiar
person
of
an
earnest
masculine
look
and
with
an
even
firm
hasty
step
she
had
had
peculiar
reason
to
adapt
herself
to
the
world
and
hence
she
understood
it
in
a
certain
sense
at
least
she
could
not
be
called
intriguing
she
was
accustomed
to
consider
distant
contingencies
and
to
carry
out
her
plans
in
silence
but
then
she
had
the
gift
of
seeing
an
opportunity
and
if
she
found
people
wavering
betwixt
doubt
and
resolution
at
the
moment
when
everything
depended
upon
decision
she
skilfully
contrived
to
infuse
into
their
minds
such
a
force
of
character
that
she
seldom
failed
to
accomplish
her
purpose
properly
speaking
she
had
no
selfish
ends
to
have
done
anything
to
have
completed
anything
especially
to
have
brought
about
a
marriage
was
reward
enough
for
her
she
had
long
since
seen
through
our
position
and
in
repeated
visits
had
carefully
observed
the
state
of
affairs
so
that
she
had
finally
convinced
herself
that
the
attachment
must
be
favored
that
our
plans
honestly
but
not
very
skilfully
taken
in
hand
and
prosecuted
must
be
promoted
and
that
this
little
romance
be
brought
to
a
close
as
speedily
as
possible
for
many
years
she
had
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
lili
mother
introduced
by
me
to
my
parents
she
had
managed
to
make
herself
agreeable
to
them
for
her
rough
sort
of
manner
is
seldom
offensive
in
an
imperial
city
and
backed
by
cleverness
and
tact
is
even
welcome
she
knew
very
well
our
wishes
and
our
hopes
her
love
of
meddling
made
her
see
in
all
this
a
call
upon
her
good
offices
in
short
she
had
a
conversation
with
our
parents
how
she
commenced
it
how
she
put
aside
the
difficulties
which
must
have
stood
in
her
way
i
know
not
but
she
came
to
us
one
evening
and
brought
the
consent
take
each
other
by
the
hand
cried
she
in
her
pathetic
yet
commanding
manner
i
stood
opposite
to
lili
and
offered
her
my
hand
she
not
indeed
hesitatingly
but
still
slowly
placed
hers
in
it
after
a
long
and
deep
breath
we
fell
with
lively
emotion
into
each
other
arms
it
was
a
strange
degree
of
the
overruling
providence
that
in
the
course
of
my
singular
history
i
should
also
have
experienced
the
feelings
of
one
who
is
betrothed
i
may
venture
to
assert
that
for
a
truly
moral
man
it
is
the
pleasantest
of
all
recollections
it
is
delightful
to
recall
those
feelings
which
are
with
difficulty
expressed
and
are
hardly
explained
for
him
the
state
of
things
is
all
at
once
changed
the
sharpest
oppositions
are
removed
the
most
inveterate
differences
are
adjusted
prompting
nature
ever
warning
reason
the
tyrannizing
impulses
and
the
sober
law
which
before
kept
up
a
perpetual
strife
within
us
all
are
now
reconciled
in
friendly
unity
and
at
the
festival
so
universally
celebrated
with
solemn
rites
that
which
was
forbidden
is
commanded
and
that
which
was
penal
is
raised
to
an
inviolable
duty
the
reader
will
learn
with
moral
approval
that
from
this
time
forward
a
certain
change
took
place
in
me
if
my
beloved
had
hitherto
been
looked
upon
as
beautiful
graceful
and
attractive
now
she
appeared
to
me
a
being
of
superior
worth
and
excellence
she
was
as
it
were
a
double
person
her
grace
and
loveliness
belonged
to
me
that
i
felt
as
formerly
but
the
dignity
of
her
character
her
her
confidence
in
all
persons
remained
her
own
i
beheld
it
i
looked
through
it
i
was
delighted
with
it
as
with
a
capital
of
which
i
should
enjoy
the
interest
as
long
as
i
lived
there
is
depth
and
significance
in
the
old
remark
on
the
summit
of
fortune
one
abides
not
long
the
consent
of
the
parties
on
both
sides
so
gained
in
such
a
peculiar
manner
by
demoiselle
delf
was
now
ratified
silently
and
without
further
formality
but
as
soon
as
we
believe
the
matter
to
be
all
settled
as
soon
as
the
ideal
as
we
may
well
call
it
of
a
betrothal
is
over
and
it
begins
to
pass
into
the
actual
and
to
enter
soberly
into
facts
then
too
often
comes
a
crisis
the
outward
world
is
utterly
unmerciful
and
it
has
reason
for
it
must
maintain
its
authority
at
all
costs
the
confidence
of
passion
is
very
great
and
we
see
it
too
often
wrecked
upon
the
rocks
of
opposing
realities
a
young
married
couple
who
enter
upon
life
unprovided
with
sufficient
means
can
promise
themselves
no
especially
in
these
latter
times
the
world
immediately
presses
upon
them
with
incompatible
demands
which
if
not
satisfied
make
the
young
couple
appear
ridiculous
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
means
which
for
the
attainment
of
my
end
i
had
anxiously
scraped
together
i
could
not
before
be
aware
because
they
had
held
out
up
to
a
certain
point
but
now
the
end
was
drawing
nearer
i
saw
that
matters
were
not
quite
what
they
ought
to
be
the
fallacy
which
passion
finds
so
convenient
was
now
exposed
in
all
its
inconsistency
my
house
my
domestic
circumstances
had
to
be
considered
in
all
their
details
with
some
soberness
the
consciousness
that
his
house
would
one
day
contain
a
lay
indeed
at
the
bottom
of
my
father
design
but
then
what
sort
of
a
lady
did
he
contemplate
the
realities
of
life
at
the
end
of
our
third
part
the
reader
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
gentle
dear
intelligent
beautiful
and
talented
maiden
so
always
like
herself
so
affectionate
and
yet
so
free
from
passion
she
was
a
fitting
to
the
arch
already
built
and
curved
but
here
upon
calm
unbiassed
consideration
it
could
not
be
denied
that
in
order
to
establish
the
newly
acquired
treasure
in
such
a
function
a
new
arch
would
have
to
be
built
however
this
had
not
yet
become
clear
to
me
and
still
less
was
it
so
to
her
mind
but
now
when
i
tried
to
fancy
myself
bringing
her
to
my
home
she
did
not
seem
somehow
to
suit
it
exactly
it
appeared
to
me
something
like
what
i
had
myself
experienced
when
i
first
joined
her
social
circle
in
order
to
give
no
offence
to
the
fashionable
people
i
met
there
i
found
it
necessary
to
make
a
great
change
in
my
style
of
dress
but
this
could
not
be
so
easily
done
with
the
domestic
arrangement
of
a
stately
burgher
house
which
rebuilt
in
the
olden
style
had
with
its
antique
ornaments
given
an
character
to
the
habits
of
its
inmates
moreover
even
after
our
parents
consent
had
been
gained
it
had
not
been
possible
to
establish
friendly
relations
or
intercourse
between
our
respective
families
different
religious
opinions
produced
different
manners
and
if
the
amiable
girl
had
wished
to
continue
in
any
way
her
former
mode
of
life
it
would
have
found
neither
opportunity
nor
place
in
our
house
if
i
had
never
thought
of
all
this
until
now
it
was
because
i
had
been
quieted
by
the
opening
of
fine
prospects
from
without
and
the
hope
of
getting
some
valuable
appointment
an
active
spirit
gets
a
footing
everywhere
capacities
talents
create
confidence
every
one
thinks
that
a
change
of
management
is
all
that
is
needed
the
earnestness
of
youth
finds
favour
genius
is
trusted
for
everything
though
its
power
is
only
of
a
certain
kind
the
intellectual
and
literary
domain
of
germany
was
at
that
time
regarded
as
but
newly
broken
ground
among
the
there
were
prudent
men
who
desired
skilful
cultivators
and
prudent
managers
for
the
fields
about
to
be
turned
up
even
the
respectable
and
well
established
lodge
with
the
most
distinguished
members
of
which
i
had
become
acquainted
through
my
intimacy
with
lili
contrived
in
a
suitable
manner
to
get
me
introduced
to
them
but
i
from
a
feeling
of
independence
which
afterwards
appeared
to
me
madness
declined
all
closer
connection
with
them
not
perceiving
that
these
men
though
already
bound
together
in
a
higher
sense
would
yet
do
much
to
further
my
own
ends
so
nearly
related
to
theirs
i
return
to
more
personal
matters
in
such
cities
as
frankfort
men
often
hold
several
situations
together
such
as
residentships
and
agencies
the
number
of
which
may
by
diligence
be
indefinitely
increased
something
of
this
sort
now
occurred
to
me
and
at
first
sight
it
seemed
both
advantageous
and
honorable
it
was
assumed
that
i
should
suit
the
place
and
it
would
under
the
conditions
certainly
have
succeeded
if
it
could
have
commanded
the
of
the
chancery
triad
already
described
we
thus
suppress
our
doubts
we
dwell
only
on
what
is
favorable
by
powerful
activity
we
overcome
all
wavering
whence
there
results
a
something
untrue
in
our
position
without
the
force
of
passion
being
in
the
least
subdued
in
times
of
peace
there
is
no
more
interesting
reading
for
the
multitude
than
the
public
papers
which
furnish
early
information
of
the
latest
doings
in
the
world
the
quiet
opulent
citizen
exercises
thus
in
an
innocent
way
a
party
spirit
which
in
our
finite
nature
we
neither
can
nor
should
get
rid
of
every
comfortable
person
thus
gets
up
a
factitious
interest
like
that
which
is
often
felt
in
a
bet
experiences
an
unreal
gain
or
loss
and
as
in
the
theatre
feels
a
very
lively
though
imaginary
sympathy
in
the
good
or
evil
fortune
of
others
this
sympathy
seems
often
arbitrary
but
it
rests
on
moral
grounds
for
now
we
give
to
praiseworthy
designs
the
applause
they
deserve
and
now
again
carried
away
by
brilliant
successes
we
turn
to
those
whose
plans
we
should
otherwise
have
blamed
for
all
this
there
was
abundant
material
in
those
times
frederick
the
second
resting
on
his
victories
seemed
to
hold
in
his
hand
the
fate
of
europe
and
the
world
catherine

to
able

highly
gifted

extending
the
dominion
of

as
this
was
done
at
the
expense
of
the
turks
whom
we
are
in
the
habit
of
richly
repaying
for
the
contempt
with
which
they
look
down
upon
us
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
no
sacrifice
of
human
life
when
these
infidels
were
slain
by
thousands
the
burning
of
the
fleet
in
the
harbor
of
tschesme
caused
a
universal
jubilee
throughout
the
civilized
world
and
every
one
shared
the
exultation
of
a
victory
when
in
order
to
preserve
a
faithful
picture
of
that
great
event
a
ship
of
war
was
actually
blown
up
on
the
roads

not
long
after
this
a
young
northern
king
to
establish
his
own

seized
the
reins
of
government
out
of
the
hands
of
an
oligarchy
the
aristocrats
whom
he
overthrew
were
not
lamented
for
aristocracy
finds
no
favor
with
the
public
since
it
is
in
its
nature
to
work
in
silence
and
it
is
the
more
secure
the
less
talk
it
creates
about
itself
and
in
this
case
the
people
thought
all
the
better
of
the
young
king
since
in
order
to
balance
the
enmity
of
the
higher
ranks
he
was
obliged
to
favor
the
lower
and
to
conciliate
their
good
will
american
revolution
the
lively
interest
of
the
world
was
still
more
excited
when
a
whole
people
prepared
to
effect
their
independence
already
had
it
witnessed
a
welcome
spectacle
of
the
same
effort
on
a
small
scale
corsica
had
long
been
the
point
to
to
which
all
eyes
were
directed

despairing
of
ever
being
able
to
carry
out
his
patriotic
designs
he
passed
through
germany
to
england
attracted
and
won
all
hearts
he
was
a
fine
man
slender
fair
full
of
grace
and
friendliness
i
saw
him
in
the
house
of
bethmann
where
he
stopped
a
short
time
and
received
with
cheerful
cordiality
the
curious
visitors
who
thronged
to
see
him
but
now
similar
events
were
to
be
repeated
in
a
remote
quarter
of
the
globe
we
wished
the
americans
all
success
and
the
names
of
franklin
and
washington
began
to
shine
and
sparkle
in
the
firmament
of
politics
and
war
much
had
been
accomplished
to
improve
the
condition
of
humanity
and
now
when
in
france
a
new
and
benevolent
sovereign
evinced
the
best
intentions
of
devoting
himself
to
the
removal
of
so
many
abuses
and
to
the
noblest
ends
of
introducing
a
regular
and
efficient
system
of
political
economy
of
dispensing
with
all
arbitrary
power
and
of
ruling
alone
by
law
and
justice
the
brightest
hopes
spread
over
the
world
and
confident
youth
promised
itself
and
to
all
mankind
a
bright
and
noble
future
in
all
these
events
however
i
only
took
part
so
far
as
they
interested
society
in
general
i
myself
and
my
immediate
circle
did
not
meddle
with
the
news
of
the
day
our
affair
was
to
study
men
men
in
general
we
allowed
to
have
their
way
the
quiet
position
of
the
german
fatherland
to
which
also
my
native
city
had
now
conformed
for
upwards
of
a
hundred
years
had
been
fully
preserved
in
spite
of
many
wars
and
convulsions
a
highly
varied
gradation
of
ranks
which
instead
of
holding
the
several
classes
apart
seemed
to
bind
them
the
more
closely
together
had
promoted
the
interest
of
all
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
from
the
emperor
to
the
jew
if
the
sovereign
princes
stood
in
a
subordinate
relation
to
the
emperor
still
their
electoral
rights
and
immunities
thereby
acquired
and
maintained
were
a
full
compensation
moreover
the
highest
nobility
belonged
exclusively
to
the
agnates
of
the
royal
houses
so
that
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
distinguished
privileges
they
could
look
upon
themselves
as
equal
with
the
highest
and
even
superior
to
them
in
some
sense
since
as
spiritual
electors
they
might
take
precedence
of
all
others
and
as
branches
of
the
sacred
hierarchy
hold
an
honorable
and
uncontested
rank
if
now
we
think
of
the
extraordinary
privileges
which
these
ancient
houses
enjoyed
not
only
in
their
old
patrimonial
estates
but
also
in
the
ecclesiastical
endowments
the
knightly
orders
the
official
administration
of
the
empire
and
the
old
brotherhoods
and
alliances
for
mutual
defence
and
protection
we
can
vainly
conceive
that
this
great
body
of
influential
men
feeling
themselves
at
once
subordinated
to
and
with
the
highest
and
occupying
their
days
with
a
regular
round
of
employments
might
well
be
contented
with
their
situation
and
would
without
further
anxiety
seek
only
to
secure
and
transmit
to
their
successors
the
same
comforts
and
prerogatives
nor
was
this
class
deficient
in
intellectual
culture
already
for
more
than
a
century
the
decided
proofs
of
high
training
in
military
and
political
science
had
been
discernible
in
our
noble
soldiers
and
diplomatists
but
at
the
same
time
there
were
many
minds
who
through
literary
and
philosophical
studies
had
arrived
at
views
not
over
favorable
to
the
existing
state
of
things
state
of
germany
in
germany
scarcely
any
one
had
as
yet
learned
to
look
with
envy
on
that
monstrous
privileged
class
or
to
grudge
its
fortunate
advantages
the
middle
class
had
devoted
themselves
undisturbed
to
commerce
and
the
sciences
and
by
these
pursuits
as
well
as
by
the
practice
of
the
mechanic
arts
so
closely
related
to
them
had
raised
themselves
to
a
position
of
importance
which
fully
balanced
its
political
inferiority
the
free
or
cities
favoured
this
activity
while
individuals
felt
a
certain
quiet
satisfaction
in
it
the
man
who
increased
his
wealth
or
enhanced
his
intellectual
influence
especially
in
matters
of
law
or
state
could
always
be
sure
of
enjoying
both
respect
and
authority
in
the
supreme
courts
of
the
empire
and
indeed
in
all
others
a
learned
bench
stood
parallel
with
the
noble
the
uncontrolled
oversight
of
the
one
managed
to
keep
in
harmony
with
the
deepest
insight
of
the
other
and
experience
could
never
detect
a
trace
of
rivalry
between
them
the
noble
felt
secure
in
his
exclusive
and
privileges
and
the
burgher
felt
it
beneath
his
dignity
to
strive
for
a
semblance
of
them
by
a
little
prefix
to
his
name
the
merchant
the
manufacturer
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
pace
with
those
of
other
nations
in
progress
and
improvement
leaving
out
of
the
account
the
usual
temporary
fluctuations
we
may
certainly
say
that
it
was
on
the
whole
a
time
of
pure
advance
such
as
had
not
appeared
before
and
such
as
on
account
of
another
and
greater
progress
both
of
mind
and
things
could
not
long
continue
my
position
with
regard
to
the
higher
classes
at
this
time
was
very
favorable
in
to
be
sure
the
disagreeable
circumstances
which
arise
just
at
the
boundary
between
two
distinct
positions
were
descanted
upon
with
some
impatience
but
this
was
overlooked
in
consideration
of
the
generally
passionate
character
of
the
book
since
every
one
felt
that
it
had
no
reference
to
any
immediate
effect
but
von
had
set
me
quite
right
with
the
upper
classes
whatever
improprieties
might
be
charged
upon
my
earlier
literary
productions
in
this
work
i
had
with
considerable
learning
and
cleverness
depicted
the
old
german
constitution
with
its
inviolable
emperor
at
the
head
with
its
many
degrees
of
nobility
and
a
knight
who
in
a
time
of
general
lawlessness
had
determined
as
a
private
man
to
act
uprightly
if
not
lawfully
and
thus
fell
into
a
very
sorry
predicament
this
complicated
story
however
was
not
snatched
from
the
air
but
founded
on
fact
it
was
cheerfully
lively
and
consequently
here
and
there
a
little
modern
but
it
was
nevertheless
on
the
whole
in
the
same
spirit
as
the
brave
and
capable
man
had
with
some
degree
of
skill
set
it
forth
in
his
own
narrative
the
family
still
flourished
its
relation
to
the
frankish
knighthood
had
remained
in
all
its
integrity
although
that
relation
like
many
others
at
that
time
might
have
grown
somewhat
faint
and
nominal
now
all
at
once
the
little
stream
of
jaxt
and
the
castle
of
jaxthausen
acquired
a
poetical
importance
they
as
well
as
the
at
heilbronn
were
visited
by
travellers
it
was
known
that
i
had
the
mind
to
write
of
other
points
of
that
historical
period
and
many
a
family
which
could
readily
deduce
its
origin
from
that
time
hoped
to
see
its
ancestors
brought
to
the
light
in
the
same
way
a
strange
satisfaction
is
generally
felt
when
a
writer
felicitously
recalls
a
nation
history
to
its
recollection
men
rejoice
in
the
virtues
of
their
ancestors
and
smile
at
the
failings
which
they
believe
they
themselves
have
long
since
got
rid
of
such
a
delineation
never
fails
to
meet
with
sympathy
and
applause
and
in
this
respect
i
enjoyed
an
envied
influence
yet
it
may
be
worth
while
to
remark
that
among
the
numerous
advances
and
in
the
multitude
of
young
persons
who
attached
themselves
to
me
there
was
found
no
nobleman
on
the
other
hand
many
who
had
already
arrived
at
the
age
of
thirty
sought
me
and
visited
me
and
of
these
the
willing
and
striving
were
pervaded
by
a
joyful
hope
of
earnestly
developing
themselves
in
a
national
and
even
more
universally
humane
sense
ulrich
von
hutten
at
this
time
a
general
curiosity
about
the
epoch
between
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
century
had
commenced
and
was
very
lively
the
works
of
ulrich
von
hutten
had
fallen
into
my
hands
and
i
was
not
a
little
struck
to
see
something
so
similar
to
what
had
taken
place
in
his
time
again
manifesting
itself
in
our
later
days
the
following
letter
of
ulrich
von
hutten
to
billibald
pyrkheymer
may
therefore
suitably
find
place
here
what
fortune
gives
us
it
generally
takes
away
again
and
not
only
that
everything
else
which
accrues
to
man
from
without
is
we
see
liable
to
accident
and
change
and
yet
notwithstanding
i
am
now
striving
for
honor
which
i
should
wish
to
obtain
if
possible
without
envy
but
still
at
any
cost
for
a
fiery
thirst
for
glory
possesses
me
so
that
i
wish
to
be
ennobled
as
highly
as
possible
i
should
make
but
a
poor
figure
in
my
own
eyes
dear
billibald
if
born
in
the
rank
in
the
family
i
am
and
of
such
ancestors
i
could
be
content
to
hold
myself
to
be
noble
though
i
never
ennobled
myself
by
my
own
exertions
so
great
a
work
have
i
in
my
mind
my
thoughts
are
higher
it
is
not
that
i
would
see
myself
promoted
to
a
more
distinguished
and
more
brilliant
rank
but
i
would
fain
seek
a
fountain
elsewhere
out
of
which
i
might
draw
a
peculiar
nobility
of
my
own
and
not
be
counted
among
the
factitious
nobility
contented
with
what
i
have
received
from
my
ancestors
on
the
contrary
i
would
add
to
those
advantages
something
of
my
own
which
may
from
me
pass
over
to
my
posterity
therefore
in
my
studies
and
my
efforts
i
proceed
in
opposition
to
the
opinion
of
those
who
consider
that
what
actually
exists
is
enough
for
to
me
nothing
of
that
sort
is
enough
according
to
what
i
have
already
confessed
to
you
of
my
ambition
in
this
respect
and
i
here
avow
that
i
do
not
envy
those
who
starting
from
the
lowest
stations
have
climbed
higher
than
myself
for
on
this
point
i
by
no
means
agree
with
those
of
my
own
rank
who
are
wont
to
sneer
at
persons
who
of
a
lower
origin
have
by
their
own
talents
raised
themselves
to
eminence
for
those
with
perfect
right
are
to
be
preferred
to
us
who
have
seized
for
themselves
and
taken
possession
of
the
material
of
glory
which
we
ourselves
neglected
they
may
be
the
sons
of
fullers
or
of
tanners
but
they
have
contrived
to
attain
their
ends
by
struggling
with
greater
difficulties
than
we
ever
had
against
us
the
ignorant
man
who
envies
him
who
by
his
knowledge
has
distinguished
himself
is
not
only
to
be
called
a
fool
but
is
to
be
reckoned
among
the
miserable
indeed
among
the
most
miserable
and
with
this
disease
are
our
nobles
especially
affected
that
they
look
with
an
evil
eye
upon
such
accomplishments
for
what
in
god
name
is
it
to
envy
one
who
possesses
that
which
we
have
despised
why
have
we
not
applied
ourselves
to
the
law
why
have
we
not
ourselves
this
excellent
learning
the
best
arts
and
now
fullers
shoemakers
and
wheelwrights
go
before
us
why
have
we
forsaken
our
post
why
left
the
most
liberal
studies
to
hired
servants
and
shamefully
for
us
to
the
very
lowest
of
the
people
most
justly
has
that
inheritance
of
nobility
which
we
have
thrown
away
been
taken
possession
of
by
every
clever
and
diligent
plebeian
who
makes
it
profitable
by
its
own
industry
wretched
beings
that
we
are
who
neglect
that
which
suffices
to
raise
the
very
humblest
above
us
let
us
cease
to
envy
and
strive
also
to
obtain
what
others
to
our
deep
disgrace
have
claimed
for
themselves
every
longing
for
glory
is
honorable
all
striving
for
the
excellent
is
praiseworthy
to
every
rank
may
its
own
honor
remain
may
its
own
ornaments
be
secured
to
it
those
statues
of
my
ancestors
i
do
not
despise
any
more
than
the
richly
endowed
pedigree
but
whatever
their
worth
may
be
it
is
not
ours
unless
by
our
own
merits
we
make
it
ours
nor
can
it
endure
if
the
nobility
do
not
adopt
the
habits
which
become
them
in
vain
will
yonder
fat
and
corpulent
head
of
a
noble
house
point
to
the
images
of
his
ancestors
whilst
he
himself
inactive
resembles
a
clod
rather
than
those
whose
virtues
throw
a
halo
upon
his
name
from
bygone
days
so
much
have
i
wished
most
fully
and
most
frankly
to
confide
to
you
respecting
my
ambition
and
my
nature
although
perhaps
not
exactly
in
the
same
train
of
ideas
yet
the
same
excellent
and
strong
sentiments
had
i
to
hear
from
my
more
distinguished
friends
and
acquaintances
of
which
the
results
appeared
in
an
honest
activity
it
had
become
a
creed
that
every
one
must
earn
for
himself
a
personal
nobility
and
if
any
rivalry
appeared
in
those
fine
days
it
was
from
above
downwards
we
others
on
the
contrary
had
what
we
wished
the
free
and
approved
exercise
of
the
talents
lent
to
us
by
nature
as
far
as
could
consist
with
all
our
civil
relations
frankfort
and
its
constitution
for
my
native
city
had
in
this
a
very
peculiar
position
and
one
which
has
not
been
enough
considered
while
of
the
free
imperial
cities
the
northern
could
boast
of
an
extended
commerce
but
the
southern
declining
in
commercial
importance
cultivated
the
arts
and
manufactures
with
more
success
frankfort
on
the
main
exhibited
a
somewhat
mixed
character
combining
the
results
of
trade
wealth
and
capital
with
the
passion
for
learning
and
its
collection
of
works
of
art
the
lutheran
confession
controlled
its
government
the
ancient
lordship
of
the
now
bearing
the
name
of
the
house
of
limburg
the
house
of
frauenstein
originally
only
a
club
but
during
the
troubles
occasioned
by
the
lower
classes
faithful
to
the
side
of
intelligence
the
jurist
and
others
well
to
do
and
well
disposed
none
was
excluded
from
the
magistracy
even
those
mechanics
who
had
upheld
the
cause
of
order
at
a
critical
time
were
eligible
to
the
council
though
they
were
only
stationary
in
their
place
the
other
constitutional
counterpoises
formal
institutions
and
whatever
else
belongs
to
such
a
constitution
afforded
employment
to
the
activity
of
many
persons
while
trade
and
manufacture
in
so
favorable
a
situation
found
no
obstacle
to
their
growth
and
prosperity
the
higher
nobility
kept
to
itself
unenvied
and
almost
unnoticed
a
second
class
pressing
close
upon
it
was
forced
to
be
more
active
and
resting
upon
old
wealthy
family
foundations
sought
to
distinguish
itself
by
political
and
legal
learning
the
members
of
the
reformed
persuasion
calvinists
composed
like
the
refugees
in
other
places
a
distinguished
class
and
when
they
rode
out
in
fine
equipages
on
sundays
to
their
service
in
bockenheim
seemed
almost
to
celebrate
a
sort
of
triumph
over
the
citizen
party
who
had
the
privilege
of
going
to
church
on
foot
in
good
weather
and
in
bad
the
roman
catholics
were
scarcely
noticed
but
they
also
were
aware
of
the
advantages
which
the
other
two
confessions
had
appropriated
to
themselves
the

which
in
germany
those
who
are
ennobled

their

eighteenth
book
returning
to
literary
matters
i
must
bring
forward
a
circumstance
which
had
great
influence
on
the
german
poetry
of
this
period
and
which
is
especially
worthy
of
remark
because
this
very
influence
has
lasted
through
the
history
of
our
poetic
art
to
the
present
day
and
will
not
be
lost
even
in
the
future
from
the
earlier
times
the
germans
were
accustomed
to
rhyme
it
had
this
advantage
in
its
favour
that
one
could
proceed
in
a
very
naïve
manner
scarcely
doing
more
than
count
the
syllables
if
with
the
progress
of
improvement
attention
began
more
or
less
instinctively
to
be
paid
also
to
the
sense
and
signification
of
the
syllables
this
was
highly
praiseworthy
and
a
merit
which
many
poets
contrived
to
make
their
own
the
rhyme
was
made
to
mark
the
close
of
the
poetical
proposition
the
smaller
divisions
were
indicated
by
shorter
lines
and
a
naturally
refined
ear
began
to
make
provision
for
variety
and
grace
but
now
all
at
once
rhyme
was
rejected
before
it
was
considered
that
the
value
of
the
syllables
had
net
as
yet
been
decided
indeed
that
it
was
a
difficult
thing
to
decide
klopstock
took
the
lead
how
earnestly
he
toiled
and
what
he
has
accomplished
is
well
known
every
one
felt
the
uncertainty
of
the
matter
many
did
not
like
to
run
a
risk
and
stimulated
by
this
natural
tendency
they
snatched
at
a
poetic
prose
gessner
extremely
charming
idylls
opened
an
endless
path
klopstock
wrote
the
dialogue
of
in
prose
as
well
as
tod
death
of
through
the
domestic
tragedies
as
well
as
the
more
classic
dramas
a
style
more
lofty
and
more
impassioned
gained
possession
of
the
theatre
while
on
the
other
hand
the
iambic
verse
of
five
feet
which
the
example
of
the
english
had
spread
among
us
was
reducing
poesy
to
prose
but
in
general
the
demand
for
rhythm
and
for
rhyme
could
not
be
silenced
ramler
though
proceeding
on
vague
principles
as
he
was
always
severe
with
respect
to
his
own
productions
could
not
help
exercising
the
same
severity
upon
those
of
others
he
transformed
prose
into
verse
altered
and
improved
the
works
of
others
by
which
means
he
earned
little
thanks
and
only
confused
the
matter
still
more
those
succeeded
best
who
still
conformed
to
the
old
custom
of
rhyme
with
a
certain
observance
of
syllabic
quantity
and
who
guided
by
a
natural
taste
observed
laws
though
unexpressed
and
undetermined
as
for
example
wieland
who
although
inimitable
for
a
long
time
served
as
a
model
to
more
moderate
talents
but
still
in
any
case
the
practice
remained
uncertain
and
there
was
no
one
even
among
the
best
who
might
not
for
the
moment
have
gone
astray
hence
the
misfortune
that
this
epoch
of
our
poetic
history
so
peculiarly
rich
in
genius
produced
little
which
in
its
kind
could
be
pronounced
correct
for
here
also
the
time
was
stirring
advancing
active
and
calling
for
improvement
but
not
reflective
and
satisfying
its
own
requirements
in
order
however
to
find
a
firm
soil
on
which
poetic
genius
might
find
a
footing
to
discover
an
element
in
which
they
could
breathe
freely
they
had
gone
back
some
centuries
where
earnest
talents
were
brilliantly
prominent
amid
a
chaotic
state
of
things
and
thus
they
made
friends
with
the
poetic
art
of
those
times
the
minnesingers
lay
too
far
from
us
it
would
have
been
necessary
first
to
study
the
language
and
that
was
not
our
object
we
wanted
to
five
and
not
to
learn
hans
sachs
hans
sachs
the
really
masterly
poet
was
one
whom
we
could
more
readily
sympathise
with
a
man
of
true
talent
not
indeed
like
the
minnesinging
knights
and
courtiers
but
a
plain
citizen
such
as
we
also
boasted
ourselves
to
be
a
didactic
realism
suited
us
and
on
many
occasions
we
made
use
of
the
easy
rhythm
of
the
readily
occurring
rhyme
his
manner
seemed
so
suitable
to
mere
poems
of
the
day
and
to
such
occasional
pieces
as
we
were
called
upon
to
write
at
every
hour
if
important
works
which
required
the
attention
and
labor
of
a
year
or
a
whole
life
were
built
more
or
less
upon
such
hazardous
grounds
on
trivial
occasions
it
may
be
imagined
how
wantonly
all
other
ephemeral
productions
took
their
rise
and
shape
for
example
the
poetical
epistles
parables
and
invectives
of
all
forms
with
which
we
went
on
making
war
within
ourselves
and
seeks
squabbling
abroad
of
this
kind
besides
what
has
already
been
printed
something
though
very
little
survives
it
may
be
laid
up
somewhere
brief
allusions
will
suffice
to
reveal
to
thinking
men
their
origin
and
purposes
persons
of
more
than
ordinary
penetration
to
whose
sight
these
may
hereafter
be
brought
will
be
ready
to
observe
that
an
honest
purpose
lay
at
the
bottom
of
all
such
eccentricities
an
upright
will
revolts
against
presumption
nature
against
conventionalities
talent
against
forms
genius
with
itself
energy
against
indecision
undeveloped
capacity
against
developed
mediocrity
so
that
the
whole
proceeding
may
be
regarded
as
a
skirmish
which
follows
a
declaration
of
war
and
gives
promise
of
a
violent
contest
for
strictly
considered
the
contest
is
not
yet
fought
out
in
these
fifty
years
it
is
still
going
on
only
in
a
higher
region
the
hanswurst
hochzeit
i
had
in
imitation
of
an
old
german
puppet
play
invented
a
wild
extravaganza
which
was
to
bear
the
title
of
pudding
the
scheme
was
as
follows
hanswurst
a
rich
young
farmer
and
an
orphan
has
just
come
of
age
and
wishes
to
marry
a
rich
maiden
named
ursel
blandine
his
guardian
kilian
brustflech
and
her
mother
ursel
are
highly
pleased
with
the
purpose
their
plans
their
dearest
wishes
are
at
last
fulfilled
and
gratified
there
is
not
the
slightest
obstacle
and
properly
the
whole
interest
turns
only
upon
this
that
the
young
people
ardour
for
their
union
is
delayed
by
the
necessary
arrangements
and
formalities
of
the
occasion
as
prologue
enters
the
inviter
to
the
wedding
festivities
who
proclaims
the
banns
after
the
traditional
fashion
and
ends
with
the
rhymes
the
wedding
feast
is
at
the
house
of
mine
host
of
the
golden
louse
to
obviate
the
charge
of
violating
the
unity
of
place
the
aforesaid
tavern
with
its
glittering
insignia
was
placed
in
the
background
of
the
theatre
but
so
that
all
its
four
sides
could
be
presented
to
view
by
being
turned
upon
a
peg
and
as
it
was
moved
round
the
front
scenes
of
the
stage
had
to
undergo
corresponding
changes
in
the
first
act
the
front
of
the
house
facing
the
street
was
turned
to
the
audience
with
its
golden
sign
magnified
as
it
were
by
the
solar
microscope
in
the
second
act
the
side
towards
the
garden
the
third
was
towards
a
little
wood
the
fourth
towards
a
neighboring
lake
which
gave
rise
to
a
prediction
that
in
aftertimes
the
decorator
would
have
little
difficulty
in
carrying
a
wave
over
the
whole
stage
up
to
the
prompter
box
but
all
this
does
not
as
yet
reveal
the
peculiar
interest
of
the
piece
the
principal
joke
which
was
carried
out
even
to
an
absurd
length
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
whole
consisted
of
mere
traditional
german
nicknames
which
at
once
brought
out
the
characters
of
the
individuals
and
determined
their
relations
to
one
another
as
we
would
fain
hope
that
the
present
book
will
be
read
aloud
in
good
society
and
even
in
decent
family
circles
we
can
not
venture
after
the
custom
of
every
to
name
our
persons
here
in
order
nor
to
cite
the
passages
in
which
they
most
clearly
and
prominently
showed
themselves
in
their
true
colours
although
in
the
simplest
way
possible
lively
roguish
broad
allusions
and
witty
jokes
could
not
but
arise
we
add
one
leaf
as
a
specimen
leaving
our
editors
the
liberty
of
deciding
upon
its
admissibility
cousin
schuft
through
his
relationship
to
the
family
was
entitled
to
an
invitation
to
the
feast
no
one
had
anything
to
say
against
it
for
though
he
was
a
thoroughly
fellow
yet
there
he
was
and
since
he
was
there
they
could
not
with
propriety
leave
him
out
on
such
a
too
they
were
not
to
remember
that
they
had
occasionally
been
dissatisfied
with
him
with
master
schurke
it
was
a
still
more
serious
case
he
had
indeed
been
useful
to
the
family
when
it
was
to
his
own
profit
on
the
other
hand
again
he
had
injured
it
perhaps
in
this
case
also
with
an
eye
to
his
own
interests
perhaps
too
because
he
found
an
opportunity
those
who
were
any
ways
prudent
voted
for
his
admission
the
few
who
would
have
excluded
him
were
but
there
was
a
third
person
about
whom
it
was
still
more
difficult
to
decide
an
orderly
man
in
society
no
less
than
others
obliging
agreeable
useful
in
many
ways
he
had
the
single
failing
that
he
could
not
bear
his
name
to
be
mentioned
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
it
was
instantaneously
transported
into
a
heroic
fury
like
that
which
the
northmen
call
attempted
to
kill
all
right
and
left
and
in
his
frenzy
hurt
others
and
received
hurt
himself
indeed
the
second
act
of
the
piece
was
brought
through
him
to
a
very
perplexed
termination
here
was
an
opportunity
which
could
not
allow
to
pass
for
chastising
the
piratical
publisher
macklot
he
is
introduced
going
about
hawking
his
macklot
wares
and
when
he
hears
of
the
preparation
for
the
wedding
he
can
not
resist
the
impulse
to
go
spunging
for
a
dinner
and
to
stuff
his
ravening
maw
at
other
people
expense
he
announces
himself
kilian
brustflech
inquires
into
his
claims
but
is
obliged
to
refuse
him
since
it
was
an
understanding
that
all
the
guests
should
be
well
known
public
characters
to
which
recommendation
the
applicant
can
make
no
claim
macklot
does
his
best
to
show
that
he
is
as
renowned
as
any
of
them
but
when
kilian
brustflech
as
a
strict
master
of
ceremonies
shows
himself
immoveable
the
nameless
person
who
has
recovered
from
his
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
espouses
the
cause
of
his
near
relative
the
so
urgently
that
the
latter
is
finally
admitted
among
the
guests
the
stolbergs
about
this
time
the
counts
stolberg
arrived
at
frankfort
they
were
on
a
journey
to
switzerland
and
wished
to
make
us
a
visit
the
earliest
productions
of
my
dawning
talent
which
appeared
in
the
göttingen
had
led
to
my
forming
a
friendly
relation
with
them
and
with
all
those
other
young
men
whose
characters
and
labors
are
now
well
known
at
that
time
rather
strange
ideas
were
entertained
of
friendship
and
love
they
applied
themselves
to
nothing
more
properly
speaking
than
a
certain
vivacity
of
youth
which
led
to
a
mutual
association
and
to
an
interchange
of
minds
full
indeed
of
talent
but
nevertheless
uncultivated
such
a
mutual
relation
which
looked
indeed
like
confidence
was
mistaken
for
love
for
genuine
inclination
i
deceived
myself
in
this
as
well
as
others
and
have
in
more
than
one
way
suffered
from
it
many
years
there
is
still
in
existence
a
letter
of
bürger
belonging
to
that
time
from
which
it
may
be
seen
that
among
these
companions
there
was
no
question
about
the
moral
æsthetic
every
one
felt
himself
excited
and
thought
that
he
might
act
and
poetize
accordingly
the
brothers
arrived
bringing
count
haugwitz
with
them
they
were
received
by
me
with
open
heart
with
kindly
propriety
they
lodged
at
the
hotel
but
were
generally
with
us
at
dinner
the
first
joyous
meeting
proved
highly
gratifying
but
troublesome
eccentricities
soon
manifested
themselves
a
singular
position
arose
for
my
mother
in
her
ready
frank
way
she
could
carry
herself
back
to
the
middle
age
at
once
and
take
the
part
of
aja
with
some
lombard
or
byzantine
princess
they
called
her
nothing
else
but
frau
aja
and
she
was
pleased
with
the
joke
entering
the
more
heartily
into
the
fantasies
of
youth
as
she
believed
she
saw
her
own
portrait
in
the
lady
of
götz
von
berlichingen
but
this
could
not
last
long
we
had
dined
together
but
a
few
times
when
once
after
enjoying
glass
after
glass
our
poetic
hatred
for
tyrants
showed
itself
and
we
avowed
a
thirst
for
the
blood
of
such
villains
my
father
smiled
and
shook
his
head
my
mother
had
scarcely
heard
of
a
tyrant
in
her
life
however
she
recollected
having
seen
the
copperplate
engraving
of
such
a
monster
in
gottfried
chronicle
king
cambyses
whom
he
describes
as
having
shot
with
an
arrow
the
little
son
of
an
enemy
through
the
heart
and
boasting
of
his
deed
to
the
father
face
this
still
stood
in
her
memory
to
give
a
cheerful
turn
to
the
conversation
which
continually
grew
more
violent
she
betook
herself
to
her
cellar
where
her
oldest
wines
lay
carefully
preserved
in
large
casks
there
she
had
in
store
no
less
treasure
than
the
vintages
of
and
all
under
her
own
especial
watch
and
ward
which
were
seldom
broached
except
on
solemn
festive
occasions
as
she
set
before
us
the
wine
in
the
polished
decanter
she
exclaimed
here
is
the
true
tyrant
blood
glut
yourselves
with
this
but
let
all
murderous
thoughts
go
out
of
my
house
yes
tyrants
blood
indeed
i
cried
there
is
no
greater
tyrant
than
the
one
whose
heart
blood
is
here
set
before
you
regale
yourselves
with
it
but
use
moderation
for
beware
lest
he
subdue
you
by
his
spirit
and
agreeable
taste
the
vine
is
the
universal
tyrant
who
ought
to
be
rooted
up
let
us
therefore
choose
and
reverence
as
our
patron
saint
the
holy
lycurgus
the
thracian
he
set
about
the
pious
work
in
earnest
and
though
at
last
blinded
and
corrupted
by
the
infatuating
demon
bacchus
he
yet
deserves
to
stand
high
in
the
army
of
martyrs
above
this
is
the
very
vilest
tyrant
at
once
an
oppressor
a
flatterer
and
a
hypocrite
the
first
draughts
of
his
blood
are
sweetly
relishing
but
one
drop
incessantly
entices
another
after
it
they
succeed
each
other
like
a
necklace
of
pearls
which
one
fears
to
pull
apart
if
any
should
suspect
me
here
of
substituting
as
the
best
historians
have
done
a
fictitious
speech
for
the
actual
address
i
can
only
express
my
regret
that
no
writer
had
taken
down
this
peroration
at
once
and
handed
it
down
to
us
the
thoughts
would
be
found
the
same
but
the
flow
of
the
language
perhaps
more
graceful
and
attractive
above
all
however
in
the
present
sketch
as
a
whole
there
is
a
want
of
that
diffuse
eloquence
and
fulness
of
youth
which
feels
itself
and
knows
not
whither
its
strength
and
faculty
will
carry
it
the
stolbergs
in
a
city
like
frankfort
one
is
placed
in
a
strange
position
strangers
continually
crossing
each
other
point
to
every
region
of
the
globe
and
awaken
a
passion
for
travelling
on
many
an
occasion
before
now
i
had
shown
an
inclination
to
be
moving
and
now
at
the
very
moment
when
the
great
point
was
to
make
an
experiment
whether
i
could
renounce
lili
when
a
certain
painful
disquiet
unfitted
me
for
all
regular
business
the
proposition
of
the
stolbergs
that
i
should
accompany
them
to
switzerland
was
welcome
stimulated
moreover
by
the
exhortations
of
my
father
who
looked
with
pleasure
on
the
idea
of
my
travelling
in
that
direction
and
who
advised
me
not
to
omit
to
pass
over
into
italy
if
a
suitable
occasion
should
offer
itself
i
at
once
decided
to
go
and
soon
had
everything
packed
for
the
journey
with
some
intimation
but
without
i
separated
myself
from
lili
she
had
so
grown
into
my
heart
that
i
did
not
believe
it
possible
to
part
myself
from
her
in
a
few
hours
i
found
myself
with
my
merry
in
darmstadt
even
at
court
we
should
not
always
act
with
perfect
propriety
here
count
haugwitz
took
the
lead
he
was
the
youngest
of
us
all
well
formed
of
a
delicate
but
noble
appearance
with
soft
friendly
features
of
an
equable
disposition
sympathizing
enough
but
with
so
much
moderation
that
contrasted
with
us
he
appeared
quite
impassible
consequently
he
had
to
put
up
with
all
sorts
of
jibes
and
nicknames
from
them
this
was
all
very
well
so
long
as
they
believed
that
they
might
act
like
children
of
nature
but
as
soon
as
occasion
called
for
propriety
and
when
one
was
again
obliged
not
unwillingly
to
put
on
the
reserve
of
a
count
then
he
knew
how
to
introduce
and
to
smoothe
over
everything
so
that
we
always
came
off
with
tolerable
credit
if
not
with
i
spent
my
time
meanwhile
with
merck
who
in
his
mephistophelist
manner
looked
upon
my
intended
journey
with
an
evil
eye
and
described
my
companions
who
had
also
paid
him
a
visit
with
a
discrimination
that
listened
not
to
any
suggestions
of
mercy
in
his
way
he
knew
me
thoroughly
the
naïve
and
indomitable
good
nature
of
my
character
was
painful
to
him
the
everlasting
purpose
to
take
things
as
they
are
the
live
and
let
live
was
his
detestation
it
is
a
foolish
trick
he
said
your
going
with
these
burschen
and
then
he
would
describe
them
aptly
but
not
altogether
justly
throughout
there
was
a
want
of
good
feeling
and
here
i
could
believe
that
i
could
see
further
than
he
did
although
i
did
not
in
fact
do
this
but
only
knew
how
to
appreciate
those
ideas
of
their
character
which
lay
beyond
the
circle
of
his
vision
you
will
not
stay
long
with
them
was
the
close
of
all
his
remarks
on
this
occasion
i
remember
a
remarkable
saying
of
his
which
he
repeated
to
me
at
a
later
time
which
i
had
often
repeated
to
myself
and
frequently
found
confirmed
in
life
thy
striving
said
he
thy
unswerving
effort
is
to
give
a
poetic
form
to
the
real
others
seek
to
give
reality
to
the
poetic
to
the
imaginative
and
of
that
nothing
will
ever
come
but
stupid
stuff
whoever
apprehends
the
immense
difference
between
these
two
modes
of
action
whoever
insists
and
acts
upon
this
conviction
has
reached
the
solution
of
a
thousand
other
things
unhappily
before
our
party
left
darmstadt
an
incident
happened
which
tended
to
verify
beyond
dispute
the
opinion
of
merck
among
the
extravaganzas
which
grew
out
of
the
notion
that
we
should
try
to
transport
ourselves
into
a
state
of
nature
was
that
of
bathing
in
public
waters
in
the
open
air
and
our
friends
after
violating
every
other
law
of
propriety
could
not
forego
this
additional
unseemliness
darmstadt
situated
on
a
sandy
plain
without
running
water
had
it
appeared
a
pond
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
i
only
heard
on
this
occasion
my
friends
who
were
hot
by
nature
and
moreover
kept
continually
heating
themselves
sought
refreshment
in
this
pond
the
sight
of
naked
youths
in
the
clear
sunshine
might
well
seem
something
strange
in
this
region
at
all
events
scandal
arose
merck
sharpened
his
conclusions
and
i
do
not
deny
that
i
was
glad
to
hasten
our
departure
on
the
way
to
mannheim
in
spite
of
all
good
and
noble
feelings
which
we
entertained
in
common
a
certain
difference
in
sentiment
and
conduct
already
exhibited
itself
leopold
stolberg
told
us
with
much
of
feeling
and
passion
that
he
had
been
forced
to
renounce
a
sincere
attachment
to
a
beautiful
english
lady
and
on
that
account
had
undertaken
so
long
a
journey
when
he
received
in
return
the
sympathising
confession
that
we
too
were
not
strangers
to
such
experiences
then
he
gave
vent
without
respect
to
the
feelings
of
youth
declaring
that
nothing
in
the
world
could
be
compared
with
his
passion
his
sufferings
or
with
the
beauty
and
amiability
of
his
beloved
if
by
moderate
observations
we
tried
as
is
proper
among
good
companions
to
bring
him
duly
to
qualify
his
assertion
it
only
made
matters
worse
and
count
haugwitz
as
well
as
i
were
inclined
at
last
to
let
the
matter
drop
when
we
had
reached
mannheim
we
occupied
pleasant
chambers
in
a
respectable
hotel
and
after
our
first
dinner
there
during
the
dessert
at
which
the
wine
was
not
spared
leopold
challenged
us
to
drink
to
the
health
of
his
fair
one
which
was
done
noisily
enough
after
the
glasses
were
drained
he
cried
out
but
now
out
of
goblets
thus
consecrated
no
more
drinking
must
be
permitted
a
second
health
would
be
a
profanation
therefore
let
us
annihilate
these
vessels
and
with
these
words
he
dashed
the
against
the
wall
behind
him
the
rest
of
us
followed
his
example
and
i
imagined
at
the
moment
that
merck
pulled
me
by
the
collar
but
youth
still
retains
this
trait
of
childhood
that
it
harbors
no
malice
against
good
companions
that
its
unsophisticated
good
nature
may
be
brushed
somewhat
roughly
indeed
to
be
sure
but
can
not
be
permanently
injured
klopstock
the
glasses
thus
proclaimed
angelical
had
considerably
swelled
our
reckoning
comforting
ourselves
however
and
determined
to
be
merry
we
hastened
for
carlsruhe
there
to
enter
a
new
circle
with
all
the
confidence
of
youth
and
its
freedom
from
care
there
we
found
klopstock
who
still
maintained
with
dignity
his
ancient
authority
over
disciples
who
held
him
in
reverence
i
also
gladly
did
homage
to
him
so
that
when
bidden
to
his
court
with
the
others
i
probably
conducted
myself
tolerably
well
for
a
novice
one
felt
too
in
a
certain
manner
called
upon
to
be
natural
and
sensible
at
the
same
time
the
reigning
margrave
highly
honored
among
the
german
sovereigns
as
one
of
their
princely
seniors
but
more
especially
on
account
of
the
excellent
aims
of
his
government
was
glad
to
converse
about
matters
of
political
economy
the
margravine
active
and
well
versed
in
the
arts
and
various
useful
branches
of
knowledge
was
also
pleased
by
some
graceful
speeches
to
manifest
a
certain
sympathy
for
us
for
which
we
were
duly
grateful
though
when
at
home
we
could
not
refrain
from
venting
some
severe
remarks
upon
her
miserable
and
the
favor
she
showed
to
the
piratical
bookseller
macklot
the
circumstance
however
of
importance
for
me
was
that
the
young
duke
of
had
arrived
here
to
enter
into
a
formal
matrimonial
engagement
with
his
noble
bride
the
princess
louisa
of
president
von
moser
had
already
arrived
on
the
same
business
in
order
to
settle
this
important
contract
with
the
count
görtz
and
fully
to
ratify
it
my
conversations
with
both
the
high
personages
were
most
friendly
and
at
the
farewell
audience
they
both
made
me
repeated
assurances
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
them
to
see
me
at
weimar
some
private
conversations
with
klopstock
won
me
by
the
friendliness
they
showed
and
led
me
to
use
openness
and
candour
with
him
i
communicated
to
him
the
latest
scenes
of
faust
which
he
seemed
to
approve
of
indeed
as
i
afterwards
learned
he
had
spoken
of
them
to
others
with
marked
commendation
a
thing
not
usual
with
him
and
expressed
a
wish
to
see
the
conclusion
of
the
piece
my
sister
our
former
rudeness
though
sometimes
as
we
called
it
our
demeanour
was
kept
in
something
like
a
chaste
restraint
in
carlsruhe
which
is
decent
and
almost
holy
ground
i
parted
from
my
companions
as
i
had
resolved
to
take
a
wide
round
and
go
to
emmendingen
where
my
was
high
bailiff
i
looked
upon
this
visit
to
my
sister
as
a
real
trial
i
knew
that
she
had
not
a
happy
existence
while
there
was
no
cause
to
find
fault
with
her
with
her
husband
or
with
circumstances
she
was
of
a
peculiar
nature
of
which
it
is
difficult
to
speak
we
will
endeavour
however
to
set
down
here
whatever
admits
of
being
described
a
fine
form
was
in
her
favor
but
not
so
her
features
which
although
expressing
clearly
enough
goodness
intelligence
and
sensibility
were
nevertheless
wanting
in
regularity
and
grace
add
to
this
that
a
high
and
strongly
arched
forehead
exposed
still
more
by
the
abominable
fashion
of
dressing
the
hair
back
on
the
head
contributed
to
leave
a
certain
unpleasant
impression
although
it
bore
the
best
testimony
to
her
moral
and
intellectual
qualities
i
can
fancy
that
if
after
the
modern
fashion
she
had
surrounded
the
upper
part
of
her
face
with
curls
and
clothed
her
temples
and
cheeks
with
ringlets
she
would
have
found
herself
more
agreeable
before
the
mirror
without
fear
of
displeasing
others
as
well
as
herself
then
there
was
the
grave
fault
that
her
skin
was
seldom
clean
an
evil
which
from
her
youth
up
by
some
demoniacal
fatality
was
most
sure
to
show
itself
on
all
festal
occasions
and
at
concerts
balls
and
other
parties
in
spite
of
these
drawbacks
she
gradually
made
her
way
however
as
her
better
and
nobler
qualities
showed
themselves
more
distinctly
a
firm
character
not
easily
controlled
a
soul
that
sympathised
and
needed
sympathy
a
highly
cultivated
mind
fine
acquirements
and
talents
some
knowledge
of
languages
and
a
ready
pen
all
these
she
possessed
so
that
if
she
had
been
more
richly
favored
with
outward
charms
she
would
have
been
among
the
women
most
sought
after
in
her
day
besides
all
this
there
is
one
strange
thing
to
be
mentioned
there
was
not
the
slightest
touch
of
sensual
passion
in
her
nature
she
had
grown
up
with
me
and
had
no
other
wish
than
to
continue
and
pass
her
life
in
this
fraternal
union
since
my
return
from
the
university
we
had
been
inseparable
with
the
most
unreserved
confidence
we
shared
all
our
thoughts
feelings
and
humors
and
even
the
most
incidental
and
passing
impressions
of
every
accidental
circumstance
when
i
went
to
wetzlar
the
loneliness
of
the
house
without
me
seemed
insupportable
my
friend
schlosser
neither
unknown
nor
repugnant
to
the
good
girl
stepped
into
my
place
in
him
unfortunately
the
brotherly
affection
changed
into
a
decided
and
to
judge
from
his
strictly
conscientious
character
probably
a
first
passion
here
there
was
found
what
people
call
as
good
a
match
as
could
be
wished
and
my
sister
after
having
stedfastly
rejected
several
good
offers
but
from
insignificant
men
whom
she
always
had
an
aversion
to
allowed
herself
to
be
i
may
well
say
talked
into
accepting
him
i
must
frankly
confess
that
i
have
frequently
indulged
in
fancies
about
my
sister
destiny
i
did
not
like
to
think
of
her
as
the
mistress
of
a
family
but
rather
as
an
abbess
as
the
lady
superior
of
some
noble
community
she
possessed
every
requisite
for
such
a
high
position
while
she
was
wanting
in
all
that
the
world
deems
indispensable
in
its
members
over
feminine
souls
she
always
exercised
an
irresistible
influence
young
minds
were
gently
attracted
towards
her
and
she
ruled
them
by
the
spirit
of
her
inward
superiority
as
she
had
in
common
with
me
an
universal
tolerance
for
the
good
the
human
with
all
its
eccentricities
provided
they
did
not
amount
to
perversity
there
was
mo
need
for
seeking
to
conceal
from
her
any
idiosyncrasy
which
might
mark
any
remarkable
natural
talents
or
for
its
owner
feeling
any
constraint
in
her
presence
hence
our
parties
as
we
have
seen
before
were
always
varied
free
ingenuous
and
sometimes
perhaps
bordering
on
boldness
my
habit
of
forming
intimacies
with
young
ladies
of
a
respectful
and
obliging
nature
without
allowing
any
closer
engagement
or
relations
to
grow
out
of
them
was
mainly
owing
to
my
influence
over
me
and
now
the
sagacious
reader
who
is
capable
of
reading
into
these
lines
what
does
not
stand
written
in
them
but
is
nevertheless
implied
will
be
able
to
form
some
conception
of
the
serious
feelings
with
which
i
then
set
foot
in
emmendingen
but
at
my
departure
after
a
short
visit
a
heavier
load
lay
on
my
heart
for
my
sister
had
earnestly
recommended
not
to
say
enjoined
me
to
break
off
my
connection
with
lili
she
herself
had
suffered
much
from
engagement
schlosser
with
his
spirit
of
rectitude
did
not
betroth
himself
to
her
until
he
was
sure
of
his
appointment
under
the
grand
duke
of
baden
indeed
if
one
would
take
it
so
until
he
was
actually
appointed
the
answer
to
his
application
however
was
delayed
in
an
incredible
manner
if
i
may
express
my
conjecture
on
the
matter
the
brave
schlosser
able
man
of
business
as
he
was
was
nevertheless
on
account
of
his
downright
integrity
desirable
neither
to
the
prince
as
a
servant
immediately
in
contact
with
himself
nor
to
the
minister
who
still
less
liked
to
have
so
honest
a
coadjutor
near
to
him
his
expected
and
earnestly
desired
appointment
at
carlsruhe
was
never
filled
up
but
the
delay
was
explained
to
me
when
the
place
of
upper
bailiff
in
emmendingen
became
vacant
and
he
was
instantly
selected
for
it
thus
an
office
of
much
dignity
and
profit
was
now
intrusted
to
him
for
which
he
had
shown
himself
fully
competent
it
seemed
entirely
suited
to
his
taste
his
mode
of
action
to
stand
here
alone
to
act
according
to
his
own
conviction
and
to
be
held
responsible
for
everything
whether
for
praise
or
blame
as
no
objections
could
be
raised
to
his
accepting
this
place
my
sister
had
to
follow
him
not
indeed
to
a
as
she
had
hoped
but
to
a
place
which
must
have
seemed
to
her
a
solitude
a
desert
to
a
dwelling
spacious
to
be
sure
with
an
official
dignity
and
stately
but
destitute
of
all
chance
of
society
some
young
ladies
with
whom
she
had
cultivated
an
early
friendship
followed
her
there
and
as
the
gerock
family
was
blessed
with
many
daughters
these
contrived
to
stay
with
her
in
turn
so
that
in
the
midst
of
such
privation
she
always
enjoyed
the
presence
of
at
least
one
friend
these
circumstances
these
experiences
made
her
feel
justified
in
recommending
to
me
most
earnestly
a
separation
from
lili
she
thought
it
hard
to
take
such
a
young
lady
of
whom
she
had
formed
the
highest
opinion
out
of
the
midst
of
a
lively
if
not
splendid
circle
and
to
shut
her
up
in
our
old
house
which
although
very
passable
in
its
way
was
not
suited
for
the
reception
of
distinguished
society
sticking
her
as
it
were
between
a
but
unsociable
precise
and
formal
father
and
a
mother
extremely
active
in
her
domestic
matters
who
after
the
household
business
of
the
day
was
over
would
not
like
to
be
disturbed
over
some
notable
bit
of
work
by
a
friendly
conversation
with
forward
and
refined
young
girls
on
the
other
hand
she
in
a
lively
manner
set
lili
position
before
me
for
partly
in
my
letters
partly
in
a
confidential
but
impassioned
conversation
i
had
told
her
everything
to
a
hair
unfortunately
her
conception
was
only
a
circumstantial
and
completion
of
what
a
gossiping
friend
in
whom
by
degrees
all
confidence
ceased
to
be
placed
had
contrived
by
mentioning
a
few
characteristic
traits
to
insinuate
into
her
mind
i
could
promise
her
nothing
although
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
she
had
convinced
me
i
went
on
with
that
enigmatic
feeling
in
my
heart
with
which
passion
always
nourishes
itself
for
the
child
cupid
clings
obstinately
to
the
garment
of
hope
even
when
she
is
preparing
with
long
steps
to
flee
away
schaffhausen
zurich
lavater
the
only
thing
between
this
place
and
zurich
which
i
now
clearly
remember
is
the
falls
of
the
rhine
at
schaffhausen
a
mighty
cascade
here
gives
the
indication
of
the
mountainous
region
which
we
designed
to
enter
where
each
step
becoming
steeper
and
more
difficult
we
should
have
laboriously
to
clamber
up
the
heights
the
view
of
the
lake
of
zurich
which
we
enjoyed
from
the
gate
of
the
is
still
before
me
i
say
from
the
gate
of
the
tavern
for
without
stopping
to
enter
it
i
hastened
to
lavater
he
gave
me
a
cheerful
and
hearty
reception
and
was
i
must
confess
extremely
gracious
confiding
considerate
kind
and
elevating
was
his
bearing
indeed
it
would
be
impossible
to
expect
anything
else
of
him
his
wife
with
somewhat
singular
but
serene
tenderly
pious
expression
of
countenance
fully
harmonized
like
everything
else
about
him
with
his
way
of
thinking
and
living
our
first
and
perhaps
only
theme
of
conversation
was
his
system
of
physiognomy
the
first
part
of
this
remarkable
work
was
if
i
mistake
not
already
printed
or
at
least
near
its
completion
it
might
be
said
to
be
at
once
stamped
with
genius
and
yet
empirical
methodical
but
still
in
its
instances
incomplete
and
partial
i
was
strangly
connected
with
it
lavater
wanted
all
the
world
for
and
sympathizers
during
his
travels
up
the
rhine
he
had
portraits
taken
of
a
great
many
distinguished
men
in
order
to
excite
their
personal
interest
in
a
work
in
which
they
were
to
appear
he
proceeded
in
the
same
way
with
artists
he
called
upon
every
one
to
send
him
drawings
for
illustrations
the
latter
came
and
many
were
not
exactly
suited
for
his
purpose
so
too
he
had
copperplates
engraved
in
all
parts
which
seldom
tinned
out
characteristic
copies
much
labor
had
been
bestowed
on
his
part
with
money
and
exertions
of
all
kinds
an
important
work
was
now
ready
and
full
honor
was
done
to
physiognomy
but
when
in
a
great
volume
illustrated
by
examples
physiognomy
founded
on
doctrine
was
to
set
up
its
claims
to
the
dignity
of
science
it
was
found
that
not
a
single
picture
said
what
it
ought
to
say
all
the
plates
had
to
be
censured
or
to
be
taken
with
exceptions
none
to
be
praised
but
only
tolerated
many
indeed
were
quite
altered
by
the
explanations
for
me
who
in
all
my
studies
sought
a
firm
footing
before
i
went
further
i
had
now
to
perform
one
of
the
most
painful
tasks
which
industry
could
be
set
to
let
the
reader
judge
the
manuscript
with
impressions
of
the
plates
inserted
was
sent
to
me
at
frankfort
i
was
authorized
to
strike
out
whatever
displeased
me
to
change
and
put
in
what
i
liked
however
i
made
a
very
moderate
use
of
this
liberty
in
one
instance
he
had
introduced
a
long
and
violent
piece
of
controversy
against
an
unjust
orator
which
i
left
out
and
substituted
a
cheerful
poem
about
nature
for
this
he
scolded
me
but
afterwards
when
he
had
cooled
down
approved
of
what
i
had
done
whoever
turns
over
the
four
volumes
of
physiognomy
and
what
he
will
not
repent
of
reads
them
may
conceive
the
interest
there
was
in
our
interviews
during
which
as
most
of
the
plates
contained
in
it
were
already
drawn
and
part
of
them
had
been
engraved
we
examined
and
decided
on
those
fit
to
be
inserted
in
the
work
and
considered
the
ingenious
means
by
which
those
which
did
not
exactly
tally
with
its
principles
might
be
made
instructive
and
suitable
whenever
at
present
i
look
through
the
work
of
lavater
a
strange
comic
merry
feeling
comes
over
me
it
seems
as
if
i
saw
before
me
the
shadows
of
men
formerly
known
to
me
over
whom
i
once
fretted
and
in
whom
i
find
little
satisfaction
now
the
possibility
however
of
retaining
in
some
sort
much
that
otherwise
would
have
been
unsuitable
was
owing
to
the
fine
and
decided
talent
of
the
sketcher
and
engraver
lips
he
was
in
fact
born
for
the
free
prosaic
representation
of
the
actual
which
was
precisely
the
thing
wanted
in
this
case
he
worked
under
a
singularly
exacting
physiognomist
and
therefore
was
obliged
to
look
sharp
to
approximate
to
the
demands
of
his
master
the
clever
felt
the
whole
responsibility
of
working
for
a
clerical
gentleman
from
a
city
so
highly
privileged
and
gave
his
best
care
to
the
business
living
in
a
separate
house
from
my
companions
i
became
every
day
more
of
a
stranger
to
them
without
the
least
unpleasant
feeling
having
arisen
our
rural
excursions
were
no
longer
made
together
although
in
the
city
we
still
kept
up
some
intercourse
with
all
the
arrogance
of
young
counts
they
had
honored
lavater
with
a
visit
and
appeared
to
the
skilful
physiognomist
somewhat
different
from
what
they
did
to
the
rest
of
the
world
he
spoke
to
me
about
them
and
i
remember
quite
well
that
speaking
of
leopold
stolberg
he
exclaimed
i
know
not
what
you
all
mean
he
is
a
noble
excellent
youth
and
full
of
talent
but
you
have
described
him
to
me
as
a
hero
as
a
hercules
and
i
have
never
in
my
life
seen
a
softer
and
more
sensitive
young
man
nor
if
need
be
one
more
easily
influenced
i
am
still
far
from
having
formed
a
clear
physiognomical
judgment
of
him
but
as
for
you
and
all
the
rest
you
are
in
a
fog
altogether
since
lavater
journey
on
the
lower
rhine
the
public
interest
in
him
and
his
physiognomical
studies
had
greatly
increased
visitors
of
all
sorts
crowded
upon
him
so
that
he
felt
in
some
sort
embarrassed
at
being
looked
upon
as
the
first
of
spiritual
and
intellectual
men
and
the
chief
point
of
attraction
for
strangers
hence
to
avoid
envy
and
all
unpleasant
feelings
he
managed
to
remind
and
warn
his
visitors
that
they
must
treat
other
distinguished
men
with
friendship
and
respect
visit
to
bodmer
in
this
especial
regard
was
had
to
the
aged
bodmer
and
accordingly
we
were
compelled
to
visit
him
and
pay
our
youthful
respects
to
him
he
lived
on
a
hill
above
the
large
or
old
town
which
lay
on
the
right
bank
where
the
lake
contracts
its
waters
into
the
limmat
we
crossed
the
old
town
and
by
a
path
that
became
steeper
and
steeper
at
last
ascended
the
height
behind
the
walls
where
between
the
fortifications
and
the
old
wall
a
pleasant
suburb
had
sprang
up
partly
in
continuous
and
partly
in
detached
houses
with
a
half
country
look
the
house
where
bodmer
had
passed
his
whole
life
stood
in
the
midst
of
an
open
and
cheerful
neighbourhood
which
the
day
being
beautiful
and
clear
we
often
paused
on
our
road
to
survey
with
the
greatest
pleasure
we
were
conducted
up
a
flight
of
steps
into
a
wainscoted
chamber
where
a
brisk
old
man
of
middle
stature
came
to
meet
us
he
received
us
with
his
usual
greeting
to
young
visitors
telling
us
that
we
must
consider
it
an
act
of
courtesy
on
his
part
to
have
delayed
so
long
his
departure
from
this
world
in
order
that
he
might
receive
us
kindly
form
our
acquaintance
refresh
himself
with
our
talents
and
wish
us
joy
in
our
future
career
we
on
the
other
hand
congratulated
him
that
as
a
poet
belonging
to
the
patriarchal
world
he
had
yet
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
most
highly
cultivated
city
possessed
during
his
whole
life
a
truly
idyllic
dwelling
and
in
the
high
free
air
had
enjoyed
for
so
many
long
years
such
a
wide
and
beautiful
prospect
to
feed
his
eyes
with
unfading
delight
it
seemed
anything
but
displeasing
to
the
old
man
when
we
asked
permission
to
take
a
view
from
his
window
of
the
neighbouring
scenery
and
truly
the
prospect
in
the
cheerful
sunshine
and
in
the
best
season
of
the
year
appeared
quite
incomparable
the
prospect
commanded
much
of
the
slope
from
the
great
town
down
to
the
water
edge
as
well
as
the
smaller
town
across
the
limmat
and
the
whole
of
the
fertile
towards
the
west
behind
us
on
the
left
was
a
part
of
the
lake
of
zurich
with
its
bright
rippled
surface
and
its
shores
endlessly
varying
with
alternating
hill
and
valley
and
height
after
height
in
greater
variety
than
the
eye
could
take
in
which
dazzled
by
this
splendour
delighted
to
rest
on
the
blue
range
of
the
loftier
mountains
in
the
distance
whose
snowy
summits
man
has
been
so
far
intimate
with
as
to
give
names
to
the
rapture
of
us
young
men
at
sight
of
the
marvellous
beauty
which
for
so
many
years
had
daily
been
before
him
appeared
to
please
the
old
poet
he
became
so
to
speak
ironically
sympathizing
and
we
parted
the
best
of
friends
but
rot
before
a
yearning
for
those
blue
mountain
heights
had
taken
possession
of
our
souls
now
i
am
on
the
point
of
leaving
our
worthy
patriarch
i
remark
for
the
first
time
that
i
have
as
yet
said
nothing
of
his
form
and
countenance
of
his
movements
and
his
carriage
and
bearing
in
general
i
do
not
think
it
quite
right
for
travellers
to
describe
every
distinguished
man
whom
they
visit
as
if
they
wanted
to
furnish
materials
for
advertising
a
runaway
no
one
sufficiently
considers
that
he
has
only
looked
at
the
great
man
during
the
moment
of
introduction
and
then
only
in
his
own
way
and
that
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
the
host
may
or
not
be
what
he
seemed
proud
or
meek
silent
and
talkative
cheerful
or
morose
in
this
particular
case
however
i
may
excuse
myself
from
the
attempt
by
saying
that
no
verbal
description
of
bodmer
venerable
person
would
convey
an
adequate
impression
fortunately
there
exists
a
picture
of
him
by
graff
of
bause
which
perfectly
represents
the
man
as
he
appeared
to
us
and
indeed
exactly
preserves
his
peculiar
penetrating
and
reflective
look
passavant
lavater
a
great
not
indeed
unexpected
but
still
highly
coveted
gratification
awaited
me
in
zurich
where
i
met
my
young
friend
passavant
of
a
respectable
family
of
the
reformed
persuasion
and
born
in
my
native
city
he
lived
in
switzerland
at
the
of
the
doctrine
which
he
was
afterwards
to
proclaim
as
a
preacher
with
a
frame
not
large
but
active
his
face
and
his
whole
manner
promised
a
quick
and
agreeable
resoluteness
of
character
his
hair
and
beard
were
black
his
eyes
lively
on
the
whole
you
saw
in
him
a
man
of
some
sensitiveness
but
of
moderate
energy
scarcely
had
we
embraced
one
another
and
exchanged
the
first
greeting
when
he
immediately
proposed
to
me
to
visit
the
smaller
cantons
having
himself
already
walked
through
them
with
great
delight
he
wished
with
the
sight
of
them
to
awaken
my
rapture
and
enthusiasm
while
i
was
talking
over
with
lavater
the
most
interesting
and
important
points
of
our
common
business
until
we
had
nearly
exhausted
them
my
lively
had
already
sallied
forth
in
various
directions
and
in
their
own
fashion
had
examined
the
country
passavant
receiving
and
welcoming
me
with
hearty
friendship
believed
that
he
had
gained
thereby
a
right
to
the
exclusive
possession
of
my
society
and
therefore
in
the
absence
of
my
companions
contrived
to
entice
me
to
the
mountains
the
more
easily
since
i
was
decidedly
inclined
to
accomplish
the
long
desired
ramble
in
quiet
and
at
liberty
to
follow
my
own
whims
without
further
deliberation
therefore
we
stepped
into
a
boat
and
sailed
up
the
glorious
lake
on
a
fine
clear
morning
a
poem
inserted
here
may
give
the
reader
some
intimation
of
those
happy
moments
new
draughts
of
strength
and
youthful
blood
from
this
free
world
i
press
here
nature
is
so
mild
so
good
who
clasps
me
to
her
breast
the
billows
rock
our
little
boat
the
oars
in
measure
beat
the
hills
while
clouds
around
them
float
approach
our
barque
to
meet
eye
mine
eye
why
thou
mourning
golden
dreams
are
ye
returning
though
gold
thou
dream
farewell
here
too
life
and
love
can
dwell
countless
stars
are
blinking
in
the
waters
here
on
the
mountains
drinking
clouds
of
mist
appear
round
the
cool
bay
flying
morning
breezes

ripen
fruits
are
lying
mirror
in
the
lake
we
landed
in
richterswyl
where
we
had
an
introduction
from
lavater
to
doctor
hotze
as
a
physician
and
a
highly
intelligent
and
benevolent
man
he
enjoyed
great
esteem
in
his
immediate
neighbourhood
and
in
the
whole
country
and
we
can
do
no
better
honor
to
his
memory
than
by
referring
to
a
passage
in
lavater
physiognomy
which
describes
him
after
a
very
hospitable
entertainment
which
he
relieved
with
a
highly
agreeable
and
instructive
conversation
describing
to
us
the
next
in
our
journey
we
ascended
the
mountains
which
lay
before
us
when
we
were
about
to
descend
again
into
the
vale
of
schindellegi
we
turned
round
to
take
in
once
more
the
charming
prospect
over
the
lake
of
zurich
of
my
feelings
at
that
moment
some
idea
may
be
gathered
from
the
following
lines
which
just
as
i
wrote
them
down
are
still
preserved
in
a
little
memorandum
book
dearest
lili
if
i
did
not
love
thee
i
should
revel
in
a
scene
like
this
yet
sweet
lili
if
i
did
not
love
thee
what
were
any
bliss
this
little
impromptu
seems
to
me
more
expressive
in
its
present
context
than
as
it
stands
by
itself
in
the
printed
collection
of
my
poems
mary
hermitage
the
rough
roads
which
led
to
mary
hermitage
did
not
wear
out
our
good
spirits
a
number
of
pilgrims
whom
we
had
remarked
below
upon
the
lake
now
overtook
us
and
asked
the
aid
of
our
prayers
in
behalf
of
their
pious
object
we
saluted
them
and
let
them
pass
and
as
they
moved
regularly
with
their
hymns
and
prayers
they
lent
a
characteristic
graceful
animation
to
the
dreary
heights
we
saw
livingly
marked
out
the
serpentine
path
which
we
too
had
to
travel
and
seemed
to
be
joyously
following
the
customs
of
the
romish
church
are
altogether
significant
and
imposing
to
the
protestant
inasmuch
as
he
only
recognises
the
inmost
principle
by
which
they
were
first
called
forth
the
human
element
by
which
they
are
propagated
from
race
to
race
thus
penetrating
at
once
to
the
kernel
without
troubling
himself
just
at
the
moment
with
the
shell
the
rind
or
even
with
the
tree
itself
its
twigs
leaves
bark
and
roots
we
now
saw
rising
a
dreary
treeless
vale
the
splendid
church
the
cloister
of
broad
and
stately
compass
in
the
midst
of
a
neat
place
of
sojourn
for
a
large
and
varied
assembly
of
guests
the
little
church
within
the
church
the
former
hermitage
of
the
saint
incrusted
with
marble
and
transformed
as
far
as
possible
into
a
regular
chapel
was
something
new
to
me
something
that
i
had
not
seen
this
little
vessel
surrounded
and
built
over
with
pillars
and
vaults
it
could
not
but
excite
sober
thoughts
to
reflect
how
a
single
spark
of
goodness
and
of
the
fear
of
god
had
here
kindled
a
bright
and
burning
flame
so
that
troops
of
believers
never
ceased
to
make
painful
pilgrimages
in
order
to
light
their
little
tapers
at
this
holy
fire
however
the
fact
is
to
be
explained
it
plainly
points
at
least
to
an
unbounded
craving
in
man
for
equal
light
for
equal
warmth
with
that
which
this
old
hermit
cherished
and
enjoyed
in
the
deepest
feeling
and
the
most
secure
conviction
we
were
shewn
into
the
treasure
chamber
which
was
rich
and
imposing
enough
and
offered
to
the
astonished
eye
busts
of
the
size
of
life
not
to
say
colossal
of
the
saints
and
founders
of
different
orders
a
very
different
sort
of
feeling
was
awakened
at
the
sight
of
a
closet
opening
upon
this
it
was
filled
with
antique
valuables
here
dedicated
and
honored
my
attention
was
fixed
by
various
golden
crowns
of
remarkable
workmanship
out
of
which
i
contemplated
one
exclusively
it
was
a
pointed
crown
in
the
style
of
former
days
such
as
one
may
have
seen
in
pictures
on
the
heads
of
ancient
queens
but
of
a
most
tasteful
design
and
of
highly
elaborate
execution
the
colored
stones
with
which
it
was
studded
were
distributed
over
it
or
set
opposite
to
each
other
with
great
effect
and
judgment
it
was
in
short
a
work
of
that
kind
which
one
would
pronounce
perfect
at
the
first
glance
without
waiting
to
bring
out
this
impression
by
an
appeal
to
the
laws
of
art
in
such
cases
where
the
art
is
not
recognised
but
felt
heart
and
soul
are
turned
towards
the
object
one
would
like
to
possess
the
jewel
that
one
might
impart
pleasure
to
others
with
such
a
gift
i
begged
permission
to
handle
the
little
crown
and
as
i
held
it
up
respectfully
in
my
hand
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
i
should
like
to
press
it
upon
the
bright
glittering
locks
of
lili
lead
her
before
the
mirror
and
witness
her
own
joy
in
it
and
the
happiness
which
she
spread
around
her
i
have
often
thought
since
that
this
scene
if
realized
by
a
skilful
painter
would
be
highly
touching
and
full
of
meaning
it
were
worth
one
while
to
be
the
young
king
to
receive
a
bride
and
a
new
kingdom
in
this
way
in
order
to
show
us
all
the
treasures
of
the
cloister
they
led
us
into
a
cabinet
of
natural
and
artificial
curiosities
i
had
then
but
little
idea
of
the
value
of
such
things
at
that
time
geognosy
which
is
so
commendable
in
itself
but
which
fritters
away
the
impression
produced
by
the
earth
beautiful
surface
on
the
mind
eye
had
not
begun
to
entice
me
still
less
had
a
fantastic
geology
entangled
me
in
its
labyrinths
nevertheless
the
monk
who
acted
as
our
guide
compelled
me
to
bestow
some
attention
on
a
fossil
much
prized
as
he
said
by
connoisseurs
a
small
wild
boar
head
well
preserved
in
a
lump
of
blue
fuller
clay
which
black
as
it
was
has
dwelt
in
my
imagination
ever
since
they
had
found
it
in
the
country
of
rapperswyl
a
district
which
ever
since
the
memory
of
man
was
so
full
of
morasses
that
it
could
well
receive
and
keep
such
mummies
for
posterity
far
different
attractions
was
presented
to
me
by
a
copperplate
engraving
of
martin
schön
which
was
kept
under
a
glass
frame
and
represented
the
assumption
of
the
virgin
true
only
a
perfect
specimen
could
give
an
idea
of
the
art
of
such
a
master
but
then
we
are
so
affected
by
it
as
with
the
perfect
in
every
branch
of
art
that
we
can
not
get
rid
of
the
wish
to
possess
something
in
some
way
like
it
to
be
able
constantly
to
repeat
the
sight
of
it
however
long
a
time
may
intervene
why
should
i
not
anticipate
and
confess
here
that
afterwards
i
could
not
rest
until
i
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
excellent
copy
of
this
plate
the
on
the
of
july
for
here
i
find
a
date
first
set
down
we
entered
upon
a
toilsome
journey
wild
stony
heights
were
to
be
surmounted
and
that
too
in
a
perfect
solitude
and
wilderness
at
a
quarter
before
eight
in
the
evening
we
stood
before
the
two
mountain
peaks
which
jut
out
boldly
side
by
side
into
the
sky
for
the
first
time
we
found
snow
upon
our
path
where
on
the
lagged
rocks
it
had
been
hanging
since
the
winter
a
primeval
forest
with
its
solemn
awe
filled
the
immense
valleys
into
which
we
were
about
to
descend
refreshed
after
a
short
rest
we
sprang
with
bold
and
light
step
from
cliff
to
cliff
from
ledge
to
ledge
down
the
precipitous
and
arrived
by
ten
at
schwyz
we
had
become
at
once
weary
yet
cheerful
exhausted
yet
excited
we
eagerly
quenched
our
violent
thirst
and
felt
ourselves
still
more
inspired
imagine
the
young
man
who
but
two
years
before
had
written
and
his
still
younger
friend
who
still
earlier
had
read
that
remarkable
work
in
manuscript
and
had
been
strangely
excited
by
it
had
transported
in
some
respect
without
their
knowing
it
or
wishing
it
into
a
state
of
nature
end
there
in
the
consciousness
of
rich
powers
vividly
recalling
past
passions
clinging
to
those
of
the
present
shaping
fruitless
plans
rioting
through
the
realm
of
fancy
and
you
will
be
able
to
form
some
conception
of
our
situation
then
which
i
should
not
know
how
to
describe
if
it
did
not
stand
written
in
my
journal
laughing
and
shouting
lasted
until
midnight
on
the
morning
of
the
we
saw
the
from
our
windows
around
these
vast
and
irregular
natural
pyramids
clouds
rose
upon
clouds
at
one
in
the
afternoon
we
left
schwyz
on
our
way
to
the
rigi
at
two
we
were
on
the
lawerzer
lake
the
sun
shining
brilliantly
on
it
and
on
us
all
the
while
for
sheer
delight
we
saw
nothing
two
stout
maidens
guided
the
boat
that
looked
pretty
and
we
made
no
objection
we
arrived
upon
the
island
on
which
they
say
once
lived
the
former
lord
of
the
castle
be
this
as
it
may
the
hut
of
the
anchorite
has
now
planted
itself
amidst
the
ruins
we
climbed
the
rigi
at
seven
we
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
mother
of
god
covered
in
snow
then
passed
the
chapel
and
the
nunnery
and
rested
at
the
hotel
of
the
ox
on
the
sunday
morning
early
we
took
a
sketch
of
the
chapel
from
the
ox
at
twelve
we
went
to
kaltenbad
or
the
fountain
of
the
three
sisters
by
a
quarter
after
two
we
had
reached
the
summit
we
found
ourselves
in
the
clouds
this
time
doubly
disagreeable
to
us
since
they
both
hindered
the
prospect
and
drenched
us
with
mist
but
when
here
and
there
they
opened
and
showed
us
framed
as
it
were
by
their
outline
a
clear
majestic
world
with
the
changing
scenes
of
a
diorama
we
no
longer
lamented
these
accidents
for
it
was
a
sight
we
had
never
seen
before
and
should
never
behold
again
and
we
lingered
long
in
this
somewhat
inconvenient
position
to
catch
through
the
chinks
and
crevices
of
the
masses
of
cloud
some
little
point
of
sunny
earth
some
little
strip
of
shore
or
pretty
nook
of
the
lake
by
eight
in
the
evening
we
were
back
again
at
the
door
of
the
inn
and
refreshed
ourselves
with
baked
fish
and
eggs
and
plenty
of
wine
as
the
twilight
and
the
night
gradually
came
on
our
ears
were
filled
with
mysteriously
harmonizing
sounds
the
twinkling
of
the
chapel
bells
the
splashing
of
the
fountain
the
rustling
of
changeful
breezes
with
the
horns
of
the
foresters
in
the
distance
these
were
blest
soothing
tranquillising
moments
william
tell
at
six
on
the
morning
of
the
first
ascending
then
going
down
by
the
waldstätter
lake
we
came
to
fitznau
from
thence
by
water
to
gersau
at
noon
we
were
in
the
hotel
on
the
lake
about
two
we
were
opposite
to
grütli
where
the
three
tells
conspired
then
upon
the
flat
rock
where
the
hero
sprang
from
his
boat
and
where
the
legend
of
his
life
and
deeds
is
recorded
and
immortalized
by
a
painting
at
three
we
were
at
flüelen
where
he
embarked
and
at
four
in
altorf
where
he
shot
the
apple
aided
by
this
poetic
thread
one
winds
conveniently
through
the
labyrinth
of
these
rocky
walls
which
descending
perpendicularly
to
the
water
stand
silently
before
us
they
the
immovable
stand
there
as
quietly
as
the
of
a
theatre
success
or
failure
joy
or
sorrow
merely
pertain
to
the
persons
who
for
the
day
successively
strut
upon
the
stage
such
reflections
however
were
wholly
out
of
the
circle
of
the
vision
of
the
youths
who
then
looked
upon
them
what
had
recently
passed
had
been
dismissed
from
their
thoughts
and
the
future
lay
before
them
as
strangely
inscrutable
as
the
mountain
region
which
they
were
laboriously
penetrating
on
the
we
breakfasted
at
amstäg
where
they
cooked
us
a
savoury
dinner
of
baked
fish
here
now
on
this
mountain
ledge
where
the
reuss
which
was
at
all
times
wild
enough
was
rushing
from
rugged
clefts
and
dashing
the
cool
over
the
rocky
channels
i
could
not
help
enjoying
the
opportunity
and
refreshing
myself
in
the
foaming
waves
at
three
we
proceeded
onwards
a
row
of
went
before
us
we
marched
with
them
over
a
broad
mass
of
snow
and
did
not
learn
till
afterwards
that
it
was
hollow
underneath
the
snows
of
winter
that
had
deposited
themselves
here
in
a
mountain
gorge
which
at
other
seasons
it
was
necessary
to
skirt
circuitously
now
furnished
us
with
a
shorter
and
more
direct
road
but
the
waters
which
forced
their
way
beneath
had
gradually
undermined
the
snowy
mass
and
the
mild
summer
had
melted
more
and
more
of
the
lower
side
of
the
vault
so
that
now
like
a
broad
arched
bridge
it
formed
a
natural
connection
between
the
opposite
sides
we
convinced
ourselves
of
this
strange
freak
of
nature
by
venturing
more
than
half
way
down
into
the
broader
part
of
the
gorge
as
we
kept
ascending
we
left
pine
forests
in
the
chasm
through
which
the
reuss
from
time
to
time
appeared
foaming
and
dashing
over
rocky
precipices
at
seven
we
arrived
at
wasen
where
to
render
palatable
the
red
heavy
sour
lombardy
wine
we
were
forced
to
have
recourse
to
water
and
to
supply
by
a
great
deal
of
sugar
the
ingredient
which
nature
had
refused
to
elaborate
in
the
grape
the
landlord
showed
us
some
beautiful
crystals
but
i
had
at
that
time
so
little
interest
in
the
study
of
nature
and
such
specimens
that
i
did
not
care
to
burden
myself
with
these
mountain
products
however
cheaply
they
might
be
bought
on
the
at
six
we
were
still
ascending
the
rocks
grew
more
and
more
stupendous
and
awful
the
path
to
the
devil
stone
from
which
we
were
to
gain
a
view
of
the
bridge
was
still
more
difficult
my
companion
being
disposed
for
a
rest
proposed
me
to
sketch
the
most
important
views
my
outlines
were
perhaps
tolerably
successful
but
nothing
seemed
to
stand
out
nothing
to
retire
into
the
distance
for
such
objects
i
had
no
language
we
toiled
on
further
the
horrors
of
the
wilderness
seemed
continually
to
deepen
planes
became
hills
and
hollows
chasms
and
so
my
guide
conducted
me
to
the
cave
of
ursern
through
which
i
walked
in
somewhat
of
an
ill
humor
what
we
had
seen
thus
far
was
at
any
rate
sublime
this
darkness
took
everything
away
but
the
roguish
guide
anticipated
the
joyful
astonishment
which
would
overwhelm
me
on
my
egress
there
the
moderately
foaming
stream
wound
mildly
through
a
level
vale
surrounded
by
mountains
but
wide
enough
to
invite
habitation
above
the
clean
little
village
of
ursern
and
its
church
which
stood
opposite
to
us
on
a
level
plot
rose
a
which
was
held
sacred
because
it
protected
the
inhabitants
at
its
foot
from
the
rolling
of
the
avalanches
here
we
enjoyed
the
sight
of
vegetation
the
meadows
of
the
valley
just
beginning
to
look
green
were
adorned
along
the
river
side
with
short
willows
the
tranquillity
was
great
upon
the
level
paths
we
felt
our
powers
revive
again
and
my
was
not
a
little
proud
of
the
surprise
which
he
had
so
skilfully
contrived
the
meadows
produce
the
celebrated
ursern
cheese
and
the
youthful
travellers
high
in
spirits
pronounced
very
tolerable
wine
not
to
be
surpassed
in
order
to
heighten
their
enjoyment
and
to
give
a
more
fantastic
impulse
to
their
projects
on
the
at
three
we
left
our
quarters
that
from
the
smooth
ursern
valley
we
might
enter
upon
the
stony
valley
of
liviner
here
too
we
at
once
missed
all
vegetation
nothing
was
to
be
seen
or
heard
but
naked
or
mossy
rocks
covered
with
snow
fitful
gusts
blowing
the
clouds
backwards
and
forwards
the
rustling
of
waterfalls
the
tinkling
of
in
the
depth
of
solitude
where
we
saw
none
coming
and
none
departing
it
did
not
cost
the
imagination
much
to
see
dragons
nests
in
the
clefts
but
nevertheless
we
felt
inspired
and
elevated
by
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
picturesque
waterfalls
sublimely
various
in
all
its
rocky
steps
which
being
at
this
time
of
the
year
enriched
by
melted
snows
and
now
half
hidden
by
the
clouds
now
half
revealed
chained
us
for
some
time
to
the
spot
the
hospice
finally
we
came
to
little
as
i
might
call
them
since
they
were
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
from
the
atmospheric
streaks
before
long
a
building
loomed
towards
us
out
of
the
vapour
it
was
the
hospice
and
we
felt
great
satisfaction
at
the
thoughts
of
sheltering
ourselves
under
its
hospitable
roof

book
announced
by
the
low
barking
of
a
little
dog
which
ran
out
to
meet
us
we
were
cordially
received
at
the
door
by
an
elderly
but
active
female
she
apologised
for
the
absence
of
the
pater
who
had
gone
to
milan
but
was
expected
home
that
evening
and
immediately
without
any
more
words
set
to
work
to
provide
for
our
comfort
and
wants
we
were
shown
into
a
warm
and
spacious
room
where
bread
cheese
and
some
passable
wine
were
set
before
us
with
the
promise
of
a
more
substantial
meal
for
our
supper
the
surprise
of
the
day
was
now
talked
over
and
my
friend
was
not
a
little
proud
that
all
had
gone
off
so
well
and
that
we
had
passed
a
day
the
impressions
of
which
neither
poetry
nor
prose
could
ever
reproduce
at
length
with
the
twilight
which
did
not
here
come
on
till
late
the
venerable
father
entered
the
room
greeted
his
guests
with
dignity
but
in
a
friendly
and
cordial
manner
and
in
a
few
words
ordered
the
cook
to
pay
all
possible
attention
to
our
wishes
when
we
expressed
the
wonder
we
could
not
repress
that
he
could
like
to
pass
his
life
up
here
in
the
midst
of
such
a
perfect
wilderness
out
of
the
reach
of
all
society
he
assured
us
that
society
was
never
wanting
as
our
own
welcome
visit
might
testify
a
lively
trade
he
told
us
was
kept
up
between
italy
and
germany
this
continual
traffic
brought
him
into
relation
with
the
first
mercantile
houses
he
often
went
down
to
milan
and
also
to
lucerne
though
not
so
frequently
from
which
place
however
the
houses
which
had
charge
of
the
posting
on
the
main
route
frequently
sent
young
people
to
him
who
here
at
the
point
of
passage
between
the
two
countries
required
to
be
made
acquainted
with
all
the
circumstances
and
events
connected
with
such
affairs
amid
such
varied
conversation
the
evening
passed
away
and
we
slept
a
quiet
night
on
somewhat
short
fastened
to
the
wall
and
more
like
shelves
than
bedsteads
distant
view
of
italy
rising
early
i
soon
found
myself
under
the
open
sky
but
in
a
narrow
space
surrounded
by
tall
i
sat
down
upon
the
which
led
to
italy
and
attempted
after
the
manner
of
dilettanti
to
draw
what
could
not
be
drawn
still
less
make
a
picture
namely
the
nearest
whose
sides
with
their
white
furrows
and
black
ridges
were
gradually
made
visible
by
the
melting
of
the
snow
nevertheless
that
fruitless
effort
has
impressed
the
image
indelibly
on
my
memory
my
companion
stepped
briskly
up
to
me
and
began
what
say
you
of
the
story
of
our
spiritual
host
last
evening
have
not
you
as
well
as
myself
felt
a
desire
to
descend
from
this
dragon
height
into
those
charming
regions
below
a
ramble
through
these
gorges
must
be
glorious
and
not
very
toilsome
and
when
it
ends
with
bellinzona
what
a
pleasure
that
must
be
the
words
of
the
good
father
have
again
brought
a
living
image
before
my
soul
of
the
isles
of
the
lago
maggiore
we
have
heard
and
seen
so
much
of
them
since
keyssler
travels
that
i
can
not
resist
the
temptation
is
it
not
so
with
you
too
he
resumed
you
are
sitting
on
exactly
the
right
spot
i
stood
there
once
but
had
not
the
courage
to
jump
down
you
can
go
on
without
ceremony
wait
for
me
at
airolo
i
will
follow
with
the
courier
when
i
have
taken
leave
of
the
good
father
and
settled
everything
such
an
enterprise
i
replied
so
suddenly
undertaken
does
not
suit
me
what
the
use
of
deliberating
so
much
cried
he
we
have
money
enough
to
get
to
milan
where
we
shall
find
credit
through
our
fair
i
know
more
than
one
mercantile
friend
there
he
grew
still
more
urgent
go
said
i
and
make
all
ready
for
the
departure
then
we
will
decide
in
such
moments
it
seems
to
me
as
if
a
man
feels
no
resolution
in
himself
but
is
rather
governed
and
determined
by
earlier
impressions
lombardy
and
italy
lay
before
me
altogether
foreign
land
while
germany
as
a
dear
home
full
of
friendly
domestic
scenes
and
where
let
me
confess
it
was
that
which
had
so
long
entirely
enchained
me
and
on
which
my
existence
was
centred
remained
even
now
the
most
indispensable
element
beyond
the
limits
of
which
i
felt
afraid
to
step
a
little
golden
heart
which
in
my
happiest
hours
i
had
received
from
her
still
hung
about
my
neck
suspended
by
the
same
ribbon
to
which
she
had
tied
it
snatching
it
from
my
bosom
i
loaded
it
with
kisses
this
incident
gave
rise
to
a
poem
which
i
here
insert
round
my
neck
suspended
as
a
token
of
those
joys
that
swiftly
pass
away
art
thou
here
that
thou
lengthen
love
short
day
still
binding
when
the
bond
of
souls
is
broken
lili
from
thee
i
fly
yet
i
am
doom
to
feel
thy
fetters
still
though
to
strange
vales
and
mountains
i
depart
yes
lili
heart
must
yet
remain
attached
to
fond
heart
thus
the
bird
snapping
his
string
in
twain
seeks
his
wood
his
own
still
a
mark
of
bondage
bearing
of
that
string
a
fragment
wearing
the
old
the
bird
he
can
not
be
again
when
once
a
master
he
has
known
seeing
my
mend
with
the
guide
who
carried
our
knapsack
come
storming
up
the
heights
i
rose
hastily
and
removed
from
the
precipice
where
i
had
been
watching
his
return
lest
he
should
drag
me
down
into
the
abyss
with
him
i
also
saluted
the
pious
father
and
turned
without
saying
a
word
to
the
path
by
which
we
had
come
my
friend
followed
me
somewhat
hesitating
and
in
spite
of
his
love
and
attachment
to
me
kept
for
a
long
time
at
a
distance
behind
till
at
last
a
glorious
waterfall
brought
us
again
together
for
the
rest
of
our
journey
and
what
had
been
once
decided
was
from
henceforth
looked
upon
as
the
wisest
and
the
best
of
our
descent
i
will
only
remark
that
we
now
found
the
over
which
we
had
securely
travelled
with
a
train
a
few
days
before
all
fallen
in
and
that
now
as
we
had
to
make
a
circuit
round
the
opened
thicket
we
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
admiration
by
the
colossal
fragments
of
that
piece
of
natural
architecture
my
friend
could
not
quite
get
over
his
disappointment
at
not
returning
into
italy
very
likely
he
had
thought
of
the
plan
some
time
before
and
with
amiable
cunning
had
hoped
to
surprise
me
on
the
spot
on
this
account
our
return
did
not
proceed
so
merrily
as
our
advance
but
i
was
occupied
all
the
more
constantly
on
my
silent
route
with
trying
to
fix
at
least
in
its
more
comprehensible
and
characteristic
details
that
sense
of
the
sublime
and
vast
which
as
time
advances
usually
grows
contracted
in
our
minds
küssnacht
tell
not
without
many
both
new
and
renewed
emotions
and
reflections
did
we
pass
over
the
remarkable
heights
about
the
vierwaldstätter
lake
on
our
way
to
küssnacht
where
having
landed
and
pursued
our
ramble
we
had
to
greet
tell
chapel
which
lay
on
our
route
and
to
reflect
upon
that
assassination
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
is
so
heroical
patriotic
and
glorious
so
too
we
sailed
over
the
zuger
lake
which
we
had
seen
in
the
distance
as
we
looked
down
from
rigi
in
zug
i
only
remember
some
painted
glass
inserted
into
the
casement
of
a
chamber
of
the
inn
not
large
to
be
sure
but
excellent
in
its
way
our
route
then
led
over
the
albis
into
the
sihl
valley
where
by
visiting
a
young
hanoverian
von
lindau
who
delighted
to
live
there
in
solitude
we
sought
to
mitigate
the
vexation
which
he
had
felt
some
time
before
in
zurich
at
our
declining
the
offer
of
his
company
not
in
the
most
friendly
or
polite
manner
the
jealous
friendship
of
the
worthy
passavant
was
really
the
reason
of
my
rejecting
the
truly
dear
but
inconvenient
presence
of
another
but
before
we
descend
again
from
these
glorious
heights
to
the
lake
and
to
the
pleasantly
situated
city
i
must
make
one
more
remark
upon
my
attempts
to
carry
away
some
idea
of
the
country
by
drawing
and
sketching
a
habit
from
youth
upward
of
viewing
a
landscape
as
a
picture
led
me
whenever
i
observed
any
picturesque
spot
in
the
natural
scenery
to
try
and
fix
it
and
so
to
preserve
a
sure
memorial
of
such
moments
but
having
hitherto
only
exercised
myself
on
confined
scenes
i
soon
felt
the
incompetency
of
my
art
for
such
a
world
the
haste
i
was
in
at
once
compelled
me
to
have
recourse
to
a
singular
expedient
scarcely
had
i
noticed
an
interesting
object
and
with
light
and
very
sketchy
strokes
drawn
the
outlines
on
the
paper
than
i
noted
down
in
words
the
particular
objects
which
i
had
no
time
to
catch
and
fill
up
with
the
pencil
and
by
this
means
made
the
scenes
so
thoroughly
present
to
my
mind
that
every
locality
whenever
i
afterwards
wanted
it
for
a
poem
or
a
story
floated
at
once
before
me
and
was
entirely
at
my
command
on
returning
to
zurich
i
found
the
stolbergs
were
gone
their
stay
in
this
city
had
been
cut
short
in
a
singular
manner
it
must
be
confessed
that
travellers
upon
removing
to
a
distance
from
the
restraints
of
home
are
only
too
apt
to
think
they
are
stepping
not
only
into
an
unknown
but
into
a
perfectly
free
world
a
delusion
which
it
was
the
more
easy
to
indulge
in
at
this
time
as
there
was
not
as
yet
any
passports
to
be
examined
by
the
police
or
any
tolls
and
suchlike
checks
and
hindrances
on
the
liberty
of
travellers
to
remind
men
that
abroad
they
are
subject
to
still
worse
and
more
painful
restraints
than
at
home
if
the
reader
will
only
bear
in
mind
this
decided
tendency
to
realize
the
freedom
of
nature
he
will
be
able
to
pardon
the
young
spirits
who
regarded
switzerland
as
the
very
place
in
which
to
idyllize
the
fresh
independence
of
youth
the
tender
poems
of
gessner
as
well
as
his
charming
sketches
seemed
decidedly
to
justify
this
expectation
in
fact
bathing
in
wide
waters
seems
to
be
one
of
the
best
qualifications
for
expressing
such
poetic
talents
upon
our
journey
thus
far
such
natural
exercises
had
not
seemed
exactly
suitable
to
modern
customs
and
we
had
in
some
degree
abstained
from
them
but
in
switzerland
the
sight
of
the
cool
stream
flowing
running
rushing
then
gathering
on
the
plain
and
gradually
spreading
out
to
a
lake
presented
a
temptation
that
was
not
to
be
resisted
i
can
not
deny
that
i
joined
my
companions
in
bathing
in
the
clear
lake
but
we
chose
a
spot
far
enough
as
we
supposed
from
all
human
eyes
but
naked
bodies
shine
a
good
way
and
whoever
chanced
to
see
us
doubtless
took
offence
anecdote
of
the
stolbergs
the
good
innocent
youths
who
thought
it
nowise
shocking
to
see
themselves
half
naked
like
poetic
shepherds
or
entirely
naked
like
heathen
deities
were
admonished
by
their
friends
to
leave
off
all
such
practices
they
were
given
to
understand
that
they
were
living
not
in
primeval
nature
but
in
a
land
where
it
was
esteemed
good
and
salutary
to
adhere
to
the
old
institutions
and
customs
which
had
been
handed
down
from
the
middle
ages
they
were
not
disinclined
to
acknowledge
the
propriety
of
all
this
especially
as
the
appeal
was
made
to
the
middle
ages
which
to
them
seemed
venerable
as
a
second
nature
accordingly
they
left
the
more
public
lake
shores
but
when
in
their
walks
through
the
mountains
they
fell
in
with
the
clear
rustling
refreshing
streams
it
seemed
to
them
impossible
in
the
middle
of
july
to
abstain
from
the
refreshing
exercise
thus
on
their
wide
sweeping
walks
they
came
also
to
the
shady
vale
where
the
sihl
streaming
behind
the
albis
shoots
down
to
empty
itself
into
the
limmat
below
zurich
far
from
every
habitation
and
even
from
all
trodden
they
thought
there
could
be
no
objection
here
to
their
throwing
off
their
clothes
and
boldly
meeting
the
foaming
waves
this
was
not
indeed
done
without
a
shriek
without
a
wild
shout
of
joy
excited
partly
by
the
chill
and
partly
by
the
satisfaction
by
which
they
thought
to
consecrate
these
gloomy
wooded
rocks
into
an
idyllic
scene
but
whether
persons
previously
had
crept
after
them
or
whether
this
poetic
tumult
called
forth
adversaries
even
in
the
solitude
can
not
be
determined
suffice
it
to
say
stone
after
stone
was
thrown
at
them
from
the
motionless
bushes
above
whether
by
one
or
more
whether
accidentally
or
purposely
they
could
not
tell
however
they
thought
it
wisest
to
renounce
the
quickening
element
and
look
after
their
clothes
no
one
got
hit
they
sustained
no
injury
but
the
moral
one
of
surprise
and
chagrin
and
full
of
young
life
as
they
were
they
easily
shook
off
the
recollection
of
this
awkward
affair
but
the
most
disagreeable
consequences
fell
upon
lavater
who
was
blamed
for
having
given
so
friendly
a
welcome
to
such
saucy
youths
as
even
to
have
arranged
walks
with
them
and
otherwise
to
shew
attention
to
persons
whose
wild
unbridled
unchristian
and
even
heathenish
habits
had
caused
so
much
scandal
to
a
moral
and
neighbourhood
our
clever
friend
however
who
well
knew
how
to
smooth
over
such
unpleasant
occurrences
contrived
to
hush
up
this
one
also
and
after
the
departure
of
these
meteoric
travellers
we
found
on
our
return
peace
and
quiet
restored
in
the
fragment
of
werther
travels
which
has
lately
been
reprinted
in
the
sixteenth
volume
of
my
works
i
have
attempted
to
describe
this
contrast
of
the
commendable
order
and
legal
restraint
of
switzerland
with
that
life
of
nature
which
youth
in
its
delusions
so
loudly
demands
but
as
people
generally
are
apt
to
take
all
that
the
poet
advances
without
reserve
for
his
decided
opinions
or
even
didactic
censure
so
the
swiss
were
very
much
offended
at
the
comparison
and
i
therefore
dropped
the
intended
continuation
which
was
to
have
represented
more
or
less
in
detail
werther
progress
up
to
the
epoch
of
his
sorrows
and
which
therefore
would
certainly
have
been
interesting
to
those
who
wish
to
study
mankind
arrived
at
zurich
i
devoted
my
time
almost
exclusively
to
lavater
whose
hospitality
i
again
made
use
of
the
physiognomy
with
all
its
portraits
and
monstrous
caricatures
weighed
heavily
and
with
an
load
on
the
shoulders
of
the
worthy
man
we
arranged
all
as
well
as
we
could
under
the
circumstances
and
i
promised
him
on
my
return
home
to
continue
my
assistance
i
was
led
to
give
this
promise
by
a
certain
youthful
unlimited
confidence
in
my
own
quickness
of
comprehension
and
still
more
by
a
feeling
of
my
readiness
of
adaptation
to
any
subject
for
in
truth
the
way
in
which
lavater
dissected
physiognomies
was
not
at
all
in
my
vein
the
impression
which
at
our
first
meeting
he
had
made
upon
me
determined
in
some
degree
my
relation
to
him
although
a
general
wish
to
oblige
which
was
always
strong
joined
to
the
of
youth
had
a
great
share
in
all
my
actions
by
causing
me
to
see
things
in
a
certain
twilight
atmosphere
lavater
mind
was
altogether
an
imposing
one
in
his
society
it
was
impossible
to
resist
his
decided
influence
and
i
had
no
choice
but
to
submit
to
it
at
once
and
set
to
work
observing
foreheads
and
noses
eyes
and
mouths
in
detail
and
weighing
their
relations
and
proportions
my
fellow
observer
did
this
from
necessity
as
he
had
to
give
a
perfect
account
of
what
he
himself
had
discerned
so
clearly
but
to
me
it
always
seemed
like
a
trick
a
piece
of
espionage
to
attempt
to
analyse
a
man
into
his
elements
before
his
face
and
so
to
get
upon
the
track
of
his
hidden
moral
peculiarities
i
had
more
pleasure
in
listening
to
his
conversation
in
which
he
unveiled
himself
at
will
and
yet
i
must
confess
i
always
felt
a
degree
of
constraint
in
lavater
presence
for
while
by
his
art
of
physiognomy
he
possessed
himself
of
our
peculiarities
he
also
made
himself
by
conversation
master
of
our
thoughts
which
with
a
little
sagacity
he
would
easily
guess
from
our
variety
of
phrases
he
who
feels
a
pregnant
synthesis
in
himself
has
peculiarly
a
right
to
analyse
since
by
the
outward
particulars
he
tests
and
legitimizes
his
inward
whole
how
lavater
managed
in
such
cases
a
single
example
will
suffice
to
show
lavater
his
character
and
works
on
sundays
after
the
sermon
it
was
his
duty
as
an
ecclesiastic
to
hold
the
velvet
before
each
one
who
went
out
and
to
bless
as
he
received
the
pious
gift
now
on
a
certain
sunday
he
proposed
to
himself
without
looking
at
the
several
persons
as
they
dropped
in
their
offerings
to
observe
only
their
hands
and
by
them
silently
to
judge
of
the
forms
of
their
owner
not
only
the
shape
of
the
finger
but
its
peculiar
action
in
dropping
the
gift
was
attentively
noted
by
him
and
he
had
much
to
communicate
to
me
on
the
conclusions
he
had
formed
how
instructive
and
exciting
must
such
conversations
have
been
to
one
who
also
was
seeking
to
qualify
himself
for
a
painter
of
men
often
in
my
after
life
had
i
occasion
to
think
of
lavater
who
was
one
of
the
best
and
worthiest
men
that
i
ever
formed
so
intimate
a
relation
with
these
notices
of
him
that
i
have
introduced
in
this
work
were
accordingly
written
at
various
times
following
our
divergent
tendencies
we
gradually
became
strangers
to
each
other
and
yet
i
never
could
bring
myself
to
part
with
the
favorable
idea
which
his
worth
had
left
upon
my
mind
in
thought
i
often
brought
him
before
me
and
thus
arose
these
leaves
which
as
they
were
written
without
reference
to
and
independently
of
each
other
may
contain
some
repetitions
but
it
is
hoped
no
contradictions
by
his
cast
of
mind
lavater
was
a
decided
realist
and
knew
of
nothing
ideal
except
in
a
moral
form
by
keeping
this
remark
steadily
in
mind
you
will
most
readily
understand
this
rare
and
singular
man
his
of
look
merely
for
a
continuance
of
the
present
state
of
existence
under
easier
conditions
than
those
which
we
have
now
to
endure
his
rests
on
the
conviction
that
the
sensible
corresponds
throughout
with
the
spiritual
and
is
not
only
an
evidence
of
it
but
indeed
its
representative
the
ideals
of
art
found
little
favor
with
him
because
with
his
sharp
look
he
saw
too
clearly
the
impossibility
of
such
conceptions
ever
being
embodied
in
a
living
organization
and
he
therefore
banished
them
into
the
realm
of
fable
and
even
of
monstrosity
his
incessant
demand
for
a
realization
of
the
ideal
gained
him
the
reputation
of
a
visionary
although
he
maintained
and
felt
convinced
that
no
man
insisted
more
strongly
on
the
actual
than
he
did
accordingly
he
never
could
detect
the
error
in
his
mode
of
thinking
and
acting
seldom
has
there
been
a
man
who
strove
more
passionately
than
he
did
for
public
recognition
and
thus
he
was
particularly
fitted
for
a
teacher
but
if
all
his
labors
tended
to
the
intellectual
and
moral
improvement
of
others
this
was
by
no
means
their
ultimate
aim
to
realize
the
character
of
christ
was
what
he
had
most
at
heart
hence
that
almost
insane
zeal
of
his
to
have
pictures
of
christ
drawn
copied
moulded
one
after
another
none
of
which
however
as
to
be
expected
ever
satisfied
him
his
writings
are
hard
to
understand
even
now
for
it
is
far
from
easy
to
penetrate
into
his
precise
meaning
no
one
ever
wrote
so
much
of
the
times
and
for
the
times
as
lavater
his
writings
are
veritable
journals
which
in
an
especial
manner
require
to
be
explained
by
the
history
of
the
day
they
moreover
are
written
in
the
language
of
a
coterie
which
one
must
first
acquaint
oneself
with
before
we
can
hold
communion
with
them
otherwise
many
things
will
appear
stupid
and
absurd
even
to
the
most
intelligent
reader
indeed
objections
enough
of
the
kind
have
been
made
against
this
author
both
in
his
lifetime
and
since
thus
for
example
with
our
rage
for
dramatizing
and
representing
under
this
form
all
that
struck
us
and
caring
for
no
other
we
once
so
warmed
his
brain
with
a
dramatic
ardour
that
in
his
he
labored
very
hard
to
show
that
there
is
no
more
dramatic
work
than
the
bible
and
especially
that
the
history
of
christ
passion
must
be
regarded
as
the
drama
of
all
dramas
in
this
chapter
and
indeed
throughout
the
work
lavater
appears
greatly
to
resemble
father
abraham
of
santa
clara
for
into
this
manner
every
richly
gifted
mind
necessarily
falls
who
wishes
to
work
upon
his
contemporaries
he
must
acquaint
himself
with
existing
tendencies
and
passions
with
the
speech
and
terminology
of
the
day
and
adapt
them
to
his
ends
in
order
to
approach
the
mass
whom
he
seeks
to
influence
lavater
his
character
and
works
since
lavater
took
christ
literally
as
described
by
the
scriptures
and
by
most
commentators
he
let
this
representation
serve
so
far
for
the
supplement
of
his
own
being
that
he
ideally
incorporated
the
into
his
own
individual
humanity
until
he
finally
was
able
to
imagine
himself
melted
into
one
and
united
with
him
and
indeed
to
have
become
the
same
person
this
decidedly
literal
faith
had
also
worked
in
him
a
perfect
conviction
that
miracles
can
be
wrought
as
well
as
heretofore
accordingly
since
in
some
important
and
trying
emergencies
of
his
earlier
days
he
had
by
means
of
earnest
and
indeed
violent
prayer
succeeded
in
procuring
an
instantaneous
and
favorable
turn
of
the
impending
calamity
no
mere
cold
objections
of
the
reasoning
intellect
would
make
him
for
a
moment
waver
in
this
faith
penetrated
moreover
by
the
idea
of
the
greatness
and
excellence
of
humanity
as
restored
by
christ
and
through
him
destined
to
a
blissful
immortality
but
at
the
same
time
fully
sensible
of
the
manifold
requisitions
of
heart
and
mind
and
of
his
insatiable
yearnings
after
knowledge
and
moreover
feeling
in
himself
that
desire
of
expanding
himself
into
the
infinite
to
which
the
starry
heavens
seem
so
sensibly
to
invite
us
he
wrote
under
these
feelings
iris
of
which
must
have
appeared
a
very
strange
book
indeed
to
the
greater
part
of
his
contemporaries
all
this
striving
however
all
wishes
all
undertakings
were
overborne
by
the
genius
for
physiognomy
which
nature
had
bestowed
upon
him
for
as
the
touchstone
by
its
blackness
and
peculiar
roughness
of
surface
is
eminently
fitted
to
distinguish
between
the
metals
which
are
applied
to
it
so
that
pure
idea
of
humanity
which
lavater
carried
within
himself
and
that
sharp
yet
delicate
gift
of
observation
which
at
first
he
exercised
from
natural
impulse
occasionally
only
and
accidentally
but
afterwards
with
deliberate
reflection
and
regularly
qualified
him
in
the
highest
degree
to
note
the
peculiarities
of
individual
men
and
to
understand
distinguish
and
express
them
every
talent
which
rests
on
a
decided
natural
gift
seems
from
our
inability
to
subordinate
either
it
or
its
operations
to
any
idea
to
have
something
of
magic
about
it
and
in
truth
lavater
insight
into
the
characters
of
individuals
surpassed
all
conception
one
was
utterly
amazed
at
his
remarks
when
in
confidence
we
were
talking
of
this
or
that
person
nay
it
was
frightful
to
live
near
a
man
who
clearly
discerned
the
nicest
limits
by
which
nature
had
been
pleased
to
modify
and
distinguish
our
various
personalities
every
one
is
apt
to
believe
that
what
he
possesses
himself
may
be
communicated
to
others
and
so
lavater
was
not
content
to
make
use
of
this
great
gift
for
himself
alone
but
insisted
that
it
might
be
found
and
called
forth
in
others
nay
that
it
might
even
be
imparted
to
the
great
mass
the
many
dull
and
malicious
misinterpretations
the
stupid
jests
in
abundance
and
detracting
railleries
this
striking
doctrine
gave
rise
to
may
still
be
remembered
by
some
men
however
it
must
be
owned
that
the
worthy
man
himself
was
not
altogether
without
blame
in
the
matter
for
though
a
high
moral
sense
preserved
the
unity
of
his
inner
being
yet
with
his
manifold
labors
he
was
unable
to
attain
to
outward
unity
since
he
did
not
possess
the
slightest
capacity
for
philosophical
method
nor
for
artistic
talent
he
was
neither
thinker
nor
poet
indeed
not
even
an
orator
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
utterly
unable
to
take
a
comprehensive
and
methodical
view
he
nevertheless
formed
an
unerring
judgment
of
individual
cases
and
these
he
noted
down
boldly
side
by
side
his
great
work
on
physiognomy
is
a
striking
proof
and
illustration
of
this
in
himself
the
idea
of
the
moral
or
of
the
sensual
man
might
form
a
whole
but
out
of
himself
he
could
not
represent
this
idea
except
practically
by
individual
cases
in
the
same
way
as
he
himself
had
apprehended
them
in
life
that
very
work
sadly
shows
us
how
in
the
commonest
matter
of
experience
so
a
man
may
go
groping
about
him
for
after
spending
an
immense
sum
and
employing
every
artist
and
botcher
living
he
procured
at
last
drawings
and
engravings
which
were
so
far
without
character
that
he
is
obliged
in
his
work
to
say
after
each
one
that
it
is
more
or
less
a
failure
unmeaning
and
worthless
true
by
this
means
he
sharpened
his
own
judgment
and
the
judgment
of
others
but
it
also
proves
that
his
mental
bias
led
him
rather
to
heap
up
cases
of
experience
than
to
draw
from
them
any
clear
and
sober
principle
for
this
reason
he
never
could
come
to
results
though
i
often
pressed
him
for
them
what
in
later
life
he
confided
as
such
to
his
friends
were
none
to
me
for
they
consisted
of
nothing
more
than
a
collection
of
certain
lines
and
features
nay
warts
and
freckles
with
which
he
had
seen
certain
moral
and
frequently
immoral
peculiarities
associated
there
were
certainly
some
remarks
among
them
that
surprised
and
riveted
your
attention
but
they
formed
no
series
one
thing
followed
another
accidentally
there
was
no
gradual
advance
towards
any
general
deductions
and
no
reference
to
any
principles
previously
established
and
indeed
there
was
just
as
little
of
literary
method
or
artistic
feeling
to
be
found
in
his
other
writings
which
invariably
contained
passionate
and
earnest
expositions
of
his
thoughts
and
objects
and
supplied
by
the
most
affecting
and
appropriate
instances
what
they
could
not
accomplish
by
the
general
conception
abuse
of
the
term
genius
the
following
reflections
as
they
refer
to
those
circumstances
may
be
aptly
introduced
here
no
one
willingly
concedes
superiority
to
another
so
long
as
he
can
in
any
way
deny
it
natural
gifts
of
every
kind
can
the
least
be
denied
and
yet
by
the
common
mode
of
speaking
in
those
times
genius
was
ascribed
to
the
poet
alone
but
another
world
seemed
all
at
once
to
rise
up
genius
was
looked
for
in
the
physician
in
the
general
in
the
statesman
and
before
long
in
all
men
who
thought
to
make
themselves
eminent
either
in
theory
or
practice
zimmerman
especially
had
advanced
these
claims
lavater
by
his
views
of
physiognomy
was
compelled
to
assume
a
more
general
distribution
of
mental
gifts
by
nature
the
word
genius
became
a
universal
symbol
and
because
men
heard
it
uttered
so
often
they
thought
that
what
was
meant
by
it
was
habitually
at
hand
but
then
since
every
one
felt
himself
justified
in
demanding
genius
of
others
he
finally
believed
that
he
also
must
possess
it
himself
the
time
was
yet
far
distant
when
it
could
be
affirmed
that
genius
is
that
power
of
man
which
by
its
deeds
and
actions
gives
laws
and
rules
at
this
time
it
was
thought
to
manifest
itself
only
by
overstepping
existing
laws
breaking
established
rules
and
declaring
itself
above
all
restraint
it
was
therefore
an
easy
thing
to
be
a
genius
and
nothing
was
more
natural
than
that
extravagance
both
of
word
and
deed
should
provoke
all
orderly
men
to
oppose
themselves
to
such
a
monster
when
anybody
rushed
into
the
world
on
foot
without
exactly
knowing
why
or
whither
it
was
called
a
pass
of
genius
and
when
any
one
undertook
an
aimless
and
useless
absurdity
it
was
a
stroke
of
genius
young
men
of
vivacious
and
true
talents
too
often
lost
themselves
in
the
limitless
and
then
older
men
of
understanding
wanting
perhaps
in
talent
and
in
soul
found
a
most
malicious
gratification
in
exposing
to
the
public
gaze
their
manifold
and
ludicrous
miscarriages
for
my
part
in
the
development
and
the
expression
of
my
own
ideas
i
perhaps
experienced
far
more
hindrance
and
checks
from
the
false
and
interference
of
the
than
by
the
opposition
of
those
whose
turn
of
mind
was
directly
contrary
to
my
own
with
a
strange
rapidity
words
epithets
and
phrases
which
have
once
been
cleverly
employed
to
disparage
the
highest
intellectual
gifts
spread
by
a
sort
of
mechanical
repetition
among
the
multitude
and
in
a
short
time
they
are
to
be
heard
everywhere
even
in
common
life
and
in
the
mouths
of
the
most
uneducated
indeed
before
long
they
even
creep
into
dictionaries
in
this
way
the
word
genius
had
suffered
so
much
from
misrepresentation
that
it
was
almost
desired
to
banish
it
entirely
from
the
german
language
and
so
the
germans
with
whom
the
common
voice
is
more
apt
to
prevail
than
with
other
nations
would
perhaps
have
sacrificed
the
fairest
flower
of
speech
the
word
which
though
apparently
foreign
really
belongs
to
every
people
had
not
the
sense
for
what
is
highest
and
best
in
man
been
happily
restored
and
solidly
established
by
a
profounder
philosophy
in
the
preceding
pages
mention
has
been
frequently
made
of
the
youthful
times
of
two
men
whose
memory
will
never
hide
from
the
history
of
german
literature
and
morals
at
this
period
however
we
came
to
know
them
as
it
were
only
by
the
errors
into
which
they
were
misled
by
a
false
maxim
which
prevailed
among
their
youthful
contemporaries
nothing
therefore
can
be
more
proper
than
with
due
appreciation
and
respect
to
paint
their
natural
form
their
peculiar
individuality
just
as
it
appeared
at
that
time
and
as
their
immediate
presence
exhibited
itself
to
the
penetrating
eye
of
lavater
consequently
since
the
heavy
and
expensive
volumes
of
the
great
work
on
physiognomy
are
probably
accessible
to
a
few
only
of
our
readers
i
have
no
scruple
in
inserting
here
the
remarkable
passages
of
that
work
which
refer

through
the
whole
face
that
what
were
otherwise
a
lively
dissolves
itself
into
a
noble
modesty
and
most
artlessly
and
unconstrainedly
the
natural
pride
and
vanity
of
youth
melt
with
the
loveliness
of
twilight
into
the
easy
majesty
of
the
whole
man
the
whitish
hair
the
length
and
awkwardness
of
form
the
softness
and
lightness
of
step
the
hesitating
gait
the
flatness
of
the
breast
the
fair
unfurrowed
brow
and
various
other
features
spread
over
the
whole
man
a
certain
feminine
air
by
which
the
inward
quickness
of
action
is
moderated
and
every
intentional
offence
and
every
meanness
made
for
ever
impossible
to
the
heart
but
at
the
same
time
clearly
evincing
that
the
spirited
and
fiery
poet
with
all
his
unaffected
thirst
for
freedom
and
for
emancipation
is
neither
destined
to
be
a
man
of
business
thoroughly
persistent
who
steadily
and
resolutely
carries
out
his
plans
or
to
become
immortal
in
the
bloody
strife
and
now
in
conclusion
i
remark
for
the
first
time
that
i
have
as
yet
said
nothing
of
the
most
striking
trait
the
noble
simplicity
free
from
all
affectation
nothing
of
his
childlike
openness
of
heart
nothing
of
the
entire
unconsciousness
of
his
outward
nobility
nothing
of
the
inexpressible
with
which
he
accepts
and
bears
reproaches
or
warnings
nay
even
accusations
and
wrongful
charges
but
who
can
find
an
end
who
will
undertake
to
tell
all
that
he
sees
or
feels
in
a
good
man
in
whom
there
is
so
much
pure
humanity
description
of
the
elder
stolberg
what
i
have
said
of
the
younger
brother
how
much
of
it
may
be
said
also
of
the
elder
the
principal
thing
i
have
to
remark
is
the
following
this
figure
and
this
character
are
more
compact
and
less
diffuse
than
the
former
there
all
was
longer
or
flatter
here
all
is
shorter
broader
more
arched
and
rounded
there
all
was
vague
here
everything
is
more
precise
and
sharply
defined
so
the
brow
so
the
nose
so
the
breast
more
compressed
more
active
less
diffuse
more
of
concentrated
life
and
power
for
the
rest
the
same
amiableness
and
not
that
striking
openness
rather
more
of
reserve
but
in
principle
or
rather
in
deed
the
same
honorable
tone
the
same
invincible
abhorrence
of
injustice
and
baseness
the
same
irreconcilable
hatred
of
all
that
is
called
cunning
and
trickery
the
same
unyielding
opposition
to
tyranny
and
despotism
the
same
pure
incorruptible
sensibility
to
all
that
is
noble
and
great
and
good
the
same
need
of
friendship
and
of
freedom
the
same
sensitiveness
and
noble
thirst
for
glory
the
same
catholicity
of
heart
for
all
good
wise
sincere
and
energetic
men
renowned
or
unrenowned
known
or
misunderstood
and
the
same
inconsiderateness
no
not
exactly
the
same
the
face
is
sharper
more
contracted
firmer
has
more
inward
capacity
for
business
and
practical
counsels
more
of
enterprising
spirit
which
is
shown
especially
by
the
strongly
prominent
and
fully
rounded
bones
of
the
not
the
rich
pure
lofty
poet
feeling
not
the
ease
and
rapidity
of
the
productive
power
which
marks
the
other
but
yet
he
is
and
that
in
profounder
depths
vivacious
upright
ardent
not
the
airy
genius
of
light
floating
away
in
the
morning
red
of
heaven
and
fashioning
huge
shapes
therein
but
more
of
inward
power
though
perhaps
less
of
expression
more
powerful
and
terrible
less
of
elegance
and
finish
though
his
pencil
nevertheless
wants
neither
coloring
nor
enchantment
more
wit
and
riotous
humor
droll
satire
brow
nose
look
all
so
downward
so
decidedly
what
it
should
be
for
original
and
wit
which
does
not
gather
from
without
but
brings
forth
from
within
above
all
in
this
character
every
trait
more
prominent
more
angular
more
aggressive
more
storming
no
passive
dullness
no
relaxation
except
in
the
sunken
eyes
where
as
well
as
in
the
brow
and
nose
pleasure
evidently
sits
in
all
besides
and
even
in
this
very
brow
this
concentration
of
all
in
this
look
indeed
there
is
an
unmistakable
expression
of
natural
unacquired
greatness
strength
impetuosity
of
manliness
constancy
simplicity
precision
after
having
in
darmstadt
conceded
to
merck
the
justice
of
his
opinions
and
allowed
him
to
triumph
in
his
having
predicted
my
speedy
separation
from
these
gay
companions
i
found
myself
again
in
frankfort
well
received
by
every
one
including
my
father
although
the
latter
could
not
conceal
his
disappointment
that
i
had
not
descended
by
the
pass
to
airolo
and
announced
to
him
from
milan
my
arrival
in
italy
all
this
was
expressed
by
his
silence
rather
than
his
words
but
above
all
he
did
not
show
the
slightest
sympathy
with
those
wild
rocks
those
lakes
of
mist
and
dragons
nests
at
last
however
by
an
incidental
remark
by
no
means
intended
for
a
reproach
he
gave
me
to
understand
how
little
all
such
sights
were
worth
he
who
has
not
seen
naples
he
observed
has
lived
to
no
end
my
meeting
again
with
lili
on
my
return
i
did
not
i
could
not
avoid
seeing
lili
the
position
we
maintained
towards
each
other
was
tender
and
considerate
i
was
informed
that
they
had
fully
convinced
her
in
my
absence
that
she
must
break
off
her
intimacy
with
me
and
that
this
was
the
more
necessary
and
indeed
more
practicable
since
by
my
journey
and
voluntary
absence
i
had
given
a
sufficiently
clear
intimation
of
my
own
intentions
nevertheless
the
same
localities
in
town
and
country
the
same
friends
confidentially
acquainted
with
all
the
past
could
scarcely
be
seen
without
emotion
by
either
of
us
still
and
for
ever
lovers
although
drawn
apart
in
a
mysterious
way
it
was
an
accursed
state
which
in
a
certain
sense
resembled
hades
or
the
meeting
of
the
happy
with
the
unhappy
dead
there
were
moments
when
departed
days
seemed
to
revive
but
instantly
vanished
again
like
ghosts
some
kind
people
had
told
me
in
confidence
that
lili
when
all
the
obstacles
to
our
union
were
laid
before
her
had
declared
that
for
my
love
she
was
ready
to
renounce
all
present
ties
and
advantages
and
to
go
with
me
to
america
america
was
then
perhaps
still
more
than
now
the
eldorado
of
all
who
found
themselves
crossed
in
the
wishes
of
the
moment
but
the
very
thing
which
should
have
animated
my
hopes
only
depressed
them
the
more
my
handsome
paternal
house
only
a
few
hundred
steps
from
hers
offered
certainly
a
more
tolerable
and
more
attractive
habitation
than
an
uncertain
and
remote
locality
beyond
the
ocean
still
i
do
not
deny
that
in
her
presence
all
hopes
all
wishes
sprang
to
life
again
and
irresolution
was
stirring
within
me
true
the
injunctions
of
my
sister
were
very
peremptory
and
precise
not
only
had
she
with
all
the
shrewd
penetration
of
which
she
was
mistress
explained
the
situation
of
things
to
me
but
she
had
also
with
painfully
cogent
letters
harped
upon
the
same
text
still
more
powerfully
it
were
very
well
said
she
if
you
could
not
help
it
then
you
would
have
to
put
up
with
it
such
things
one
must
but
not
some
months
passed
away
in
this
most
miserable
of
all
conditions
every
circumstance
had
conspired
against
the
union
in
her
alone
i
felt
i
knew
lay
the
power
which
could
have
overcome
every
difficulty
both
the
lovers
conscious
of
their
position
avoided
all
solitary
interviews
but
in
company
they
could
not
help
meeting
in
the
usual
formal
way
it
was
now
that
the
strongest
trial
was
to
be
gone
through
as
every
noble
and
feeling
soul
will
acknowledge
when
i
have
explained
myself
more
fully
it
is
generally
allowed
that
in
a
new
acquaintance
in
the
formation
of
a
new
attachment
the
lover
gladly
draws
a
veil
over
the
past
growing
affection
troubles
itself
about
no
antecedents
and
as
it
springs
up
like
genius
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
it
knows
nothing
either
of
past
or
future
it
is
true
my
closer
intimacy
with
lili
had
begun
by
her
telling
me
the
story
of
her
early
youth
how
from
a
child
up
she
had
excited
in
many
both
a
liking
and
devotion
to
herself
especially
in
strangers
visiting
her
father
gay
and
lively
house
and
how
she
had
found
her
pleasure
in
all
this
though
it
had
been
attended
with
no
further
consequences
and
had
lead
to
no
permanent
tie
lili
old
lovers
true
lovers
consider
all
that
they
have
felt
before
only
as
preparation
for
their
present
bliss
only
as
the
foundation
on
which
the
structure
of
their
future
life
is
to
be
reared
past
attachments
seem
like
spectres
of
the
night
which
glide
away
before
the
break
of
day
but
what
occurred
the
fair
came
on
and
with
it
appeared
the
whole
swarm
of
those
spectres
in
their
reality
all
the
mercantile
friends
of
the
eminent
house
came
one
by
one
and
it
was
soon
manifest
that
not
a
man
among
them
was
willing
or
able
wholly
to
give
up
a
certain
claim
to
the
lovely
daughter
the
younger
ones
without
being
obtrusive
still
seemed
to
claim
the
rights
of
familiar
friends
the
with
a
certain
obliging
dignity
like
those
who
seek
to
make
themselves
beloved
and
who
in
all
probability
might
come
forward
with
higher
claims
there
were
fine
men
among
them
with
the
additional
recommendation
of
a
substantial
fortune
the
older
gentlemen
with
their
ways
and
manners
were
altogether
intolerable
they
could
not
bridle
their
hands
and
in
the
midst
of
their
disagreeable
twaddle
would
demand
a
kiss
for
which
the
cheek
was
not
refused
it
was
so
natural
to
her
gracefully
to
satisfy
every
one
the
conversation
too
excited
many
a
painful
remembrance
allusion
was
constantly
made
to
pleasure
parties
by
water
and
by
land
to
perils
of
all
kinds
with
their
happy
escapes
to
balls
and
evening
promenades
to
the
amusement
afforded
by
ridiculous
wooers
and
to
whatever
could
excite
an
uncomfortable
jealousy
in
the
heart
of
an
inconsolable
lover
who
had
as
it
were
for
a
long
time
drawn
to
himself
the
sum
of
so
many
years
but
amid
all
this
crowd
and
gaiety
she
did
not
push
aside
her
friend
and
when
she
turned
to
him
she
contrived
in
a
few
words
to
express
all
the
tenderness
which
seemed
allowable
to
their
present
position
but
let
us
turn
from
this
torture
of
which
the
memory
even
is
almost
intolerable
to
poesy
which
afforded
at
least
an
intellectual
and
heartfelt
alleviation
of
my
sufferings
belongs
somewhere
to
this
period
i
do
not
adduce
the
poem
here
because
it
does
not
reveal
the
softer
sentiment
but
seeks
only
with
genial
earnestness
to
exaggerate
the
disagreeable
and
by
comical
and
provoking
images
to
change
renunciation
into
despair
the
expresses
rather
the
sweeter
side
of
that
misery
and
on
that
account
is
here
inserted
sweetest
roses
ye
are
drooping
by
my
love
ye
were
not
worn
bloom
for
one
who
past
all
hoping
feels
his
soul
by
sorrow
torn
oh
the
days
still
live
in
thought
love
when
to
thee
my
angel
bound
i
my
garden
early
sought
love
and
for
thee
the
young
buds
found
all
the
flowers
and
fruits
i
bore
thee
and
i
cast
them
at
thy
feet
as
i
proudly
stood
before
thee
then
my
heart
with
hope
would
beat
sweetest
roses
ye
are
drooping
by
my
love
ye
were
not
worn

for
one
who
past
all
hoping
feels
his
soul
by
sorrow
torn
the
opera
of
and
was
suggested
by
the
pretty
little
romaunt
or
ballad
introduced
by
goldsmith
in
his
of
which
had
given
us
so
much
pleasure
in
our
happiest
days
when
we
never
dreamed
that
a
similar
fate
awaited
us
i
have
already
introduced
some
of
the
poetical
productions
of
this
epoch
and
i
only
wish
they
had
all
been
preserved
a
never
failing
excitement
in
the
happy
season
of
love
heightened
by
the
beginning
of
care
gave
birth
to
songs
which
throughout
expressed
no
overstrained
emotion
but
always
the
sincere
feeling
of
the
moment
from
social
songs
for
festivals
down
to
the
most
trifling
of
all
was
living
and
real
and
what
a
refined
company
had
sympathized
in
first
glad
then
sorrowful
till
finally
there
was
no
height
of
bliss
no
depth
of
woe
to
which
a
strain
was
not
devoted
all
these
internal
feelings
and
outward
doings
so
far
as
they
were
likely
to
vex
and
pain
my
father
were
by
my
mother
bustling
prudence
skilfully
kept
from
him
although
his
hope
of
seeing
me
lead
into
his
house
that
first
one
who
had
so
fully
realised
his
ideas
of
a
had
died
away
still
this
as
he
used
to
call
her
in
his
confidential
conversations
with
ms
wife
would
never
suit
him
nevertheless
he
let
matters
take
their
course
and
diligently
occupied
himself
with
his
little
chancery
the
young
juristic
friend
as
well
as
the
dexterous
amanuensis
gained
continually
more
and
more
of
influence
under
his
firm
as
the
absentee
was
now
no
longer
missed
there
they
let
me
take
my
own
way
and
sought
to
establish
themselves
firmly
upon
a
ground
on
which
i
was
not
destined
to
thrive
fortunately
my
own
tendencies
corresponded
with
the
sentiments
and
wishes
of
my
father
he
had
so
great
an
idea
of
my
poetic
talents
and
felt
so
personal
a
pleasure
in
the
applause
which
my
earliest
efforts
had
obtained
that
he
often
talked
to
me
on
the
subject
of
new
and
further
attempts
on
the
other
hand
i
did
not
venture
to
communicate
to
him
any
of
these
social
effusions
and
poems
of
passion
plan
of
egmont
as
in
von
i
had
in
my
own
way
mirrored
forth
the
image
of
an
important
epoch
of
the
world
i
now
again
carefully
looked
round
for
another
crisis
in
political
history
of
similar
interest
accordingly
the
revolt
of
the
netherlands
attracted
my
attention
in
götz
i
had
depicted
a
man
of
parts
and
energy
sinking
under
the
delusion
that
in
times
of
anarchy
ability
and
honesty
of
purpose
must
have
their
weight
and
influence
the
design
of
egmont
was
to
shew
that
the
most
firmly
established
institutions
can
not
maintain
themselves
against
a
powerful
and
shrewdly
calculating
despotism
i
had
talked
so
earnestly
with
my
father
about
what
the
piece
ought
to
be
and
what
i
wanted
to
do
that
it
inspired
him
with
an
invincible
desire
to
see
the
plan
which
i
had
already
worked
out
in
my
head
fairly
set
down
on
paper
in
order
to
its
being
printed
and
admired
in
earlier
times
while
i
still
hoped
to
gain
lili
hand
i
had
applied
myself
with
the
utmost
diligence
to
the
study
and
practice
of
legal
business
but
now
i
sought
to
fill
the
fearful
gulf
which
separated
me
from
her
with
occupations
of
more
intellect
and
soul
i
therefore
set
to
work
in
earnest
with
the
composition
of
egmont
unlike
the
first
von
however
it
was
not
written
in
succession
and
in
order
but
immediately
after
the
first
introduction
i
went
at
once
to
the
main
scenes
without
troubling
myself
about
the
various
connecting
links
i
made
rapid
progress
because
my
father
knowing
my
fitful
way
of
working
spurred
me
on
literally
and
without
exaggeration
day
and
night
and
seemed
to
believe
that
the
plan
so
easily
conceived
might
as
easily
be
executed
twentieth
book
and
so
i
got
on
rapidly
with
my
and
while
i
found
in
this
some
alleviation
of
my
wounded
passion
the
society
of
a
clever
artist
also
helped
me
through
many
wearisome
hours
and
thus
as
had
often
before
been
the
case
a
vague
desire
of
practical
improvement
brought
me
a
secret
peace
of
mind
at
a
time
when
it
could
scarcely
be
hoped
for
george
melchior
kraus
who
had
been
born
at
frankfort
but
educated
in
paris
having
just
returned
from
a
short
tour
to
the
north
of
germany
paid
me
a
visit
and
i
immediately
felt
an
impulse
and
a
need
to
attach
myself
to
him
he
was
a
cheerful
merry
fellow
whose
light
joyous
disposition
had
found
its
right
sphere
in
paris
at
that
time
paris
promised
a
pleasant
welcome
for
germans
philip
hackert
was
residing
there
in
credit
and
opulence
the

rejoiced
to

pleasant
excursions
in

to
take
original

from

were
constantly
undertaken
in

much
of

of

fluttering
in
the
style
and
spirit
of
the
time
were
always
highly
respectable
were
favorably
inclined
to
the
new
school
and
even
took
an
active
part
in

excursions
though
only
for
the
sake
of
amusement
and
experiment
greuze

quietly
by

of
representing

domestic

with
his
own

an
honored
and
easy
pencil
all
these
several
styles
our
townsman
kraus
was
able
to
take
up
and
blend
with
his
own
particular
talent
he
formed
himself
in
school
after
school
and
was
skilful
in
his
delineations
of
family
and
friendly
gatherings
equally
happy
was
he
in
his
landscape
sketches
which
cordially
commended
themselves
to
the
eye
by
their
clear
outlines
massive
shadows
and
agreeable
coloring
the
inward
sense
was
satisfied
by
a
certain
naïve
truth
while
the
admirer
of
artistic
skill
was
especially
pleased
with
the
tact
by
which
he
arranged
and
grouped
into
a
picture
what
he
had
copied
singly
from
nature
he
was
a
most
agreeable
companion
a
cheerful
equanimity
never
failed
him
obliging
without
obsequiousness
reserved
without
pride
he
was
everywhere
at
home
everywhere
beloved
the
most
active
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
manageable
of
all
mortals
with
such
talents
and
of
such
a
disposition
he
soon
won
the
favor
of
the
higher
circles
but
he
was
especially
well
received
at
the
castle
of
the
baron
von
stein
at
nassau
on
the
lahn
whose
accomplished
and
lovely
daughter
he
assisted
in
her
artistic
studies
and
in
many
ways
enlivened
the
whole
circle
upon
the
marriage
of
this
excellent
lady
to
the
count
von
werther
the
newly
wedded
couple
took
the
artist
with
them
to
thuringia
where
the
count
possessed
a
large
estate
and
thus
he
got
to
weimar
his
acquaintance
was
immediately
sought
his
talents
were
appreciated
and
a
wish
expressed
that
he
would
fix
his
permanent
abode
there
obliging
as
he
was
to
everybody
upon
his
return
at
this
time
to
frankfort
he
stimulated
my
love
of
art
which
had
been
contented
with
merely
collecting
and
to
making
practical
essays
the
neighbourhood
of
the
artist
is
indispensable
to
the
dilettante
for
the
latter
sees
all
that
is
wanting
in
himself
supplied
by
the
former
the
wishes
of
the
amateur
are
fulfilled
in
the
artist
by
a
certain
natural
talent
assisted
by
practice
i
succeeded
pretty
well
in
an
outline
and
i
could
give
the
shape
of
all
that
i
saw
before
me
in
nature
but
i
wanted
the
peculiar
plastic
power
the
skilful
industry
which
lends
a
body
to
the
outline
by
light
and
shade
my
copies
were
rather
remote
suggestions
of
the
real
form
and
my
figures
like
those
light
airy
beings
in
dante
purgatory
which
casting
no
shadow
themselves
fled
affrighted
at
the
shadows
of
actual
bodies
lavater
fishing
for
physiognomical
treasures
for
so
we
may
well
designate
the
importunate
urgency
with
which
he
called
upon
all
men
not
only
to
observe
physiognomies
but
also
practically
to
make
be
it
artistic
or
most
bungling
attempts
at
copying
faces
led
me
into
the
habit
of
taking
the
portraits
of
all
my
friends
on
grey
paper
with
black
and
white
chalk
the
likeness
was
not
to
be
mistaken
but
it
required
the
hand
of
my
artistic
friend
to
make
them
stand
out
from
the
dark
background
kraus
the
artist
in
turning
over
and
looking
through
the
rich
portfolio
of
drawings
which
the
good
kraus
had
taken
during
his
travels
we
had
most
pleasant
talk
together
when
he
came
to
the
sketches
of
scenes
and
persons
in
and
about
weimar
on
such
paintings
i
too
was
glad
to
dwell
and
you
may
imagine
that
it
must
have
been
flattering
to
the
young
man
to
see
in
so
many
pictures
only
the
text
which
was
to
lead
to
a
circumstantially
repeated
exclamation
they
would
be
glad
to
see
there
with
much
grace
he
would
imitate
the
different
persons
whose
portraits
he
had
taken
and
impersonate
the
greetings
and
invitations
he
had
received
one
very
successful
represented
the
musical
director
wolf
at
the
piano
with
his
wife
behind
him
preparing
to
sing
and
this
gave
the
artist
opportunity
to
assure
me
in
earnest
terms
of
the
warm
welcome
this
worthy
pair
would
give
me
among
his
sketches
were
several
of
the
wood
and
mountain
scenery
around
bürgel
here
an
honest
forester
more
perhaps
to
please
his
pretty
daughters
than
himself
had
by
means
of
bridges
railings
and
mossy
paths
opened
pleasant
and
sociable
walks
through
the
rough
masses
of
rocks
thickets
and
plantations
in
one
of
these
beautiful
promenades
he
had
painted
the
fair
damsels
in
white
dresses
and
not
without
their
attendant
cavaliers
in
one
of
these
you
immediately
recognized
bertuch
whose
serious
designs
upon
the
oldest
daughter
were
openly
avowed
and
kraus
was
not
offended
if
you
ventured
to
refer
a
second
youth
to
himself
and
guessed
his
growing
attachment
to
the
sister
bertuch
as
the
pupil
of
wieland
had
so
distinguished
himself
in
science
and
in
business
that
already
appointed
private
secretary
of
the
duke
he
had
the
best
possible
prospects
before
him
from
him
we
passed
to
wieland
and
talked
at
length
of
his
rectitude
and
cheerfulness
and
kindly
disposition
his
fine
literary
and
poetical
designs
were
dwelt
upon
and
allusions
were
made
to
the
influence
of
the
throughout
germany
many
other
names
of
literary
political
or
social
distinction
were
also
mentioned
and
among
them
musæus
kirms
berendis
and
ludecus
of
women
the
wife
of
wolf
and
a
widow
kotzebue
with
a
lovely
daughter
and
a
bright
boy
were
among
many
others
characterized
and
extolled
everything
seemed
to
point
to
a
fresh
and
active
life
of
literature
and
art
and
so
by
degrees
were
exhibited
all
the
various
elements
upon
which
the
young
duke
was
on
his
return
to
work
his
mother
and
guardian
had
prepared
this
state
of
things
while
as
regarded
the
introduction
of
more
important
measures
all
that
in
accordance
with
the
duty
of
such
provisional
governments
was
left
to
the
judgment
and
decision
of
the
future
sovereign
the
sad
ruin
caused
by
the
burning
of
the
palace
was
already
looked
upon
as
furnishing
occasion
for
new
improvements
the
mines
at
ilmenau
which
had
stopped
working
but
which
it
was
asserted
might
again
be
made
profitable
by
going
to
the
great
expense
of
repairing
the
deep
shaft
the
university
at
jena
which
was
somewhat
behind
the
spirit
of
the
age
and
was
consequently
threatened
with
the
loss
of
some
of
its
most
able
teachers
and
many
other
matters
roused
a
noble
common
interest
already
were
looks
cast
around
for
persons
who
in
the
upward
struggle
of
germany
might
be
qualified
to
further
such
various
designs
for
good
and
the
prospect
seemed
as
fresh
as
the
vivacity
and
energy
of
youth
could
desire
and
if
it
seemed
sad
to
bring
a
young
princess
not
to
a
home
of
a
suitable
princely
dignity
but
to
a
very
ordinary
dwelling
built
for
quite
a
different
object
still
such
beautifully
situated
and
well
contrived
as
ettenburg
belvedere
and
other
delightful
gave
enjoyment
for
the
present
and
also
a
hope
that
the
life
of
nature
thus
rendered
necessary
might
lead
to
profitable
and
agreeable
occupations
in
the
course
of
this
biography
we
have
circumstantially
exhibited
the
child
the
boy
the
youth
seeking
by
different
ways
to
approach
to
the
suprasensible
first
looking
with
strong
inclination
to
a
religion
of
nature
then
clinging
with
love
to
a
positive
one
and
finally
concentrating
himself
in
the
trial
of
his
own
powers
and
joyfully
giving
himself
up
to
the
general
faith
whilst
he
wandered
to
and
fro
space
which
lay
intermediate
between
the
sensible
and
suprasensible
regions
seeking
and
looking
about
him
much
came
in
his
way
which
did
not
appear
to
belong
to
either
and
he
seemed
to
see
more
and
more
distinctly
that
it
is
better
to
avoid
all
thought
of
the
immense
and
incomprehensible
he
thought
he
could
detect
in
nature
both
animate
and
inanimate
with
soul
or
without
soul
something
which
manifests
itself
only
in
contradictions
and
which
therefore
could
not
be
comprehended
under
any
idea
still
less
under
one
word
it
was
not
godlike
for
it
seemed
unreasonable
not
human
for
it
had
no
understanding
nor
devilish
for
it
was
beneficent
nor
angelic
for
it
often
betrayed
a
malicious
pleasure
it
resembled
chance
for
it
evolved
no
consequences
it
was
like
providence
for
it
hinted
at
connexion
all
that
limits
us
it
seemed
to
penetrate
it
seemed
to
sport
at
will
with
the
necessary
elements
of
our
existence
it
contracted
time
and
expanded
space
in
the
impossible
alone
did
it
appear
to
find
pleasure
while
it
rejected
the
possible
with
contempt
the
daemonic
egmont
to
this
principle
which
seemed
to
come
in
between
all
other
principles
to
separate
them
and
yet
to
link
them
together
i
gave
the
name
of
daemonic
after
the
example
of
the
ancients
and
of
those
who
at
any
rate
had
perceptions
of
the
same
kind
i
sought
to
screen
myself
from
this
fearful
principle
by
taking
refuge
according
to
my
usual
habits
in
an
imaginary
creation
among
the
parts
of
history
which
i
had
particularly
studied
with
some
care
were
the
events
which
have
made
the
united
netherlands
so
famous
i
had
diligently
examined
the
original
sources
and
had
endeavoured
as
far
as
possible
to
get
my
facts
at
first
hand
and
to
bring
the
whole
period
vividly
before
my
mind
eye
the
situations
it
presented
appeared
to
me
to
be
in
the
highest
degree
dramatic
while
for
a
principal
figure
around
whom
the
others
might
be
grouped
with
the
happiest
effect
there
was
count
egmont
whose
greatness
as
a
man
and
a
hero
was
most
captivating
but
for
my
purpose
it
was
necessary
to
convert
him
into
a
character
marked
by
such
peculiarities
as
would
grace
a
youth
better
than
a
man
in
years
and
an
unmarried
man
better
than
the
father
of
a
family
and
one
independent
rather
than
one
who
however
freely
disposed
nevertheless
restrained
by
the
various
relations
of
life
having
thus
in
my
conception
of
egmont
character
made
him
youthful
and
set
him
free
from
all
domestic
restraints
i
ascribed
to
him
unlimited
enjoyment
of
life
and
its
pleasures
boundless
a
gift
of
drawing
all
men
to
himself
and
consequently
also
of
winning
the
favor
of
the
people
and
which
while
it
inspired
a
princess
with
a
silent
and
a
young
child
of
nature
with
an
avowed
passion
won
for
him
the
sympathy
of
a
shrewd
statesman
and
even
the
loving
admiration
of
the
son
of
his
great
adversary
the
daemonic
influence
in
life
the
personal
courage
which
distinguishes
the
hero
is
the
foundation
upon
which
his
whole
character
rests
the
ground
and
soil
from
which
it
sprung
he
knows
no
danger
and
willingly
is
blind
to
the
greatest
when
it
is
close
at
hand
surrounded
by
enemies
we
may
at
any
rate
cut
our
way
through
them
the
meshes
of
state
policy
are
harder
to
break
through
the
daemonic
element
which
is
in
play
on
both
sides
and
in
conflict
with
which
the
lovely
falls
while
the
hated
triumphs
and
above
all
the
prospect
that
out
of
this
conflict
will
spring
a
third
element
which
will
answer
to
the
wishes
of
all
men
this
perhaps
is
what
has
gained
for
the
piece
not
indeed
immediately
on
its
first
appearance
but
later
and
at
the
right
time
the
favor
which
it
now
enjoys
here
therefore
for
the
sake
of
many
beloved
readers
i
will
anticipate
myself
and
as
i
know
not
whether
i
shall
soon
have
another
opportunity
will
express
a
conviction
which
however
i
did
not
form
till
a
considerable
period
subsequent
to
that
of
which
i
am
now
writing
although
this
daemonic
element
can
manifest
itself
in
all
corporeal
and
incorporeal
things
and
even
expresses
itself
most
distinctly
in
animals
yet
with
man
especially
does
it
stand
in
a
most
wonderful
connexion
forming
in
him
a
power
which
if
it
be
not
opposed
to
the
moral
order
of
the
world
nevertheless
does
often
so
cross
it
that
one
may
be
regarded
as
the
warp
and
the
other
as
the
woof
for
the
phenomena
which
it
gives
rise
to
there
are
innumerable
names
for
all
philosophies
and
religions
have
sought
in
prose
and
poetry
to
solve
this
enigma
and
to
read
once
for
all
the
riddle
which
nevertheless
remains
still
unriddled
by
them
but
the
most
fearful
manifestation
of
the
daemonical
is
when
it
is
seen
predominating
in
some
individual
character
during
my
life
i
have
observed
several
instances
of
this
either
more
closely
or
remotely
such
persons
are
not
always
the
most
eminent
men
either
morally
or
intellectually
and
it
is
seldom
that
they
recommend
themselves
to
our
affections
by
goodness
of
heart
a
tremendous
energy
seems
to
be
seated
in
them
and
they
exercise
a
wonderful
power
over
all
creatures
and
even
over
the
elements
and
indeed
who
shall
say
how
much
farther
such
influence
may
extend
all
the
moral
powers
combined
are
of
no
avail
against
them
in
vain
does
the
more
enlightened
portion
of
mankind
attempt
to
throw
suspicion
upon
them
as
deceived
if
not
deceivers
the
mass
is
still
drawn
on
by
them
seldom
if
ever
do
the
great
men
of
an
age
find
their
equals
among
their
contemporaries
and
they
are
to
be
overcome
by
nothing
but
by
the
universe
itself
and
it
is
from
observation
of
this
fact
that
the
strange
but
most
striking
proverb
must
have
risen
contra
deum
nisi
deus
from
these
lofty
reflections
i
return
to
the
littleness
of
my
own
life
for
which
strange
events
clothed
at
least
with
a
daemonical
appearance
were
in
store
from
the
summit
of
mont
gotthard
i
had
turned
my
back
upon
italy
and
returned
home
because
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
go
to
a
distance
from
lili
an
affection
which
is
grounded
on
the
hope
of
possessing
for
life
one
dearly
beloved
in
an
intimate
and
cordial
union
does
not
die
away
all
at
once
on
the
contrary
it
is
nourished
by
a
consideration
of
the
reasonable
desires
and
honest
hopes
we
are
conscious
of
cherishing
it
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
thing
that
in
such
cases
the
maiden
should
be
consoled
before
the
youth
to
these
beautiful
children
as
descendants
of
pandora
is
granted
the
enviable
gift
to
charm
attract
and
more
through
nature
and
of
half
purpose
than
through
design
or
of
malice
to
gather
admirers
around
them
and
thus
like
the
apprentice
they
are
often
in
danger
of
being
frightened
by
the
crowd
of
their
adorers
and
then
at
last
a
choice
must
be
made
from
among
them
all
one
must
be
exclusively
preferred
one
must
lead
home
the
bride
and
how
often
does
accident
determine
the
choice
and
sway
the
mind
of
her
who
has
to
make
the
selection
i
had
renounced
lili
from
conviction
but
love
made
me
suspect
my
own
reason
lili
had
taken
leave
of
me
with
the
same
feelings
and
i
had
set
out
on
a
beautiful
tour
in
order
to
distract
my
mind
but
it
had
produced
the
opposite
effect
as
long
as
i
was
absent
i
believed
in
the
separation
but
did
not
believe
in
the
renunciation
recollections
hopes
and
wishes
all
had
free
play
now
i
came
back
and
as
the
of
those
whose
happy
love
is
unopposed
is
a
heaven
so
the
meeting
again
of
two
lovers
who
are
kept
apart
by
cold
calculations
of
reason
is
an
intolerable
purgatory
a
forecourt
of
hell
when
i
again
entered
the
circle
in
which
lili
still
moved
all
the
dissonances
which
tended
to
oppose
our
union
seemed
to
have
gained
double
force
when
i
stood
once
more
before
her
the
conviction
that
she
was
lost
to
me
fell
heavy
upon
my
heart
accordingly
i
resolved
at
once
on
flight
and
under
this
impression
there
was
nothing
which
i
desired
more
than
that
the
young
ducal
pair
of
weimar
should
come
from
carlsruhe
to
frankfort
in
order
that
complying
with
old
and
new
imitations
i
might
follow
them
to
weimar
their
highnesses
had
always
maintained
towards
me
a
gracious
and
confidential
manner
for
which
i
on
my
part
returned
the
warmest
thanks
my
attachment
to
the
duke
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
him
my
respect
for
the
princess
whom
by
reputation
i
had
so
long
known
a
desire
to
render
personally
some
friendly
service
to
wieland
whose
conduct
had
been
so
liberal
and
to
atone
upon
the
spot
for
my
improprieties
were
motives
enough
to
induce
and
even
to
force
the
assent
of
a
youth
who
now
had
no
attachment
to
detain
him
moreover
from
lili
i
must
fly
whether
to
the
south
where
my
father
enthusiasm
was
daily
depicting
to
me
a
most
glorious
heaven
of
art
and
nature
or
to
the
north
whither
so
distinguished
a
circle
of
eminent
men
invited
me
the
young
princely
pair
now
reached
frankfort
on
their
way
home
the
duke
of
meiningen
suite
was
there
at
the
same
time
and
by
him
as
well
as
by
the
privy
counsellor
von
dürkheim
who
accompanied
the
young
prince
i
was
received
in
the
most
friendly
manner
possible
but
now
to
keep
up
the
fashion
of
my
youth
a
strange
incident
was
not
wanting
a
little
misunderstanding
arose
to
throw
me
into
an
incredible
but
rather
laughable
perplexity
a
little
perplexity
their
highnesses
of
weimar
and
meiningen
were
living
in
the
same
hotel
i
received
one
day
an
invitation
to
dinner
my
mind
was
so
preoccupied
with
the
court
of
weimar
that
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
more
particularly
to
inform
myself
especially
as
i
had
not
the
presumption
to
imagine
that
any
notice
would
be
taken
of
me
by
the
duke
of
meiningen
accordingly
i
go
full
dressed
to
the
roman
emperors
and
making
my
way
to
the
apartments
of
the
weimar
family
find
them
empty
being
informed
that
the
duke
and
his
suite
are
with
his
highness
of
meiningen
i
betake
myself
thither
and
am
kindly
received
supposing
that
this
is
only
a
morning
visit
or
that
perhaps
the
two
dukes
are
to
dine
together
i
await
the
issue
suddenly
however
the
weimar
suite
sets
itself
in
motion
and
i
of
course
follow
but
instead
of
returning
to
their
own
apartments
they
go
straight
down
stairs
and
into
their
chariots
and
i
am
left
alone
in
the
street
now
instead
of
inquiring
into
the
matter
and
adroitly
and
prudently
seeking
some
solution
of
it
i
with
my
usual
precipitancy
went
straight
home
where
i
found
my
parents
at
supper
my
father
shook
his
head
while
my
mother
made
every
possible
excuse
for
me
in
the
evening
she
told
me
in
confidence
that
after
i
had
left
the
table
my
father
had
said
that
he
wondered
very
much
how
i
generally
acute
enough
could
not
see
that
in
that
quarter
they
only
wished
to
make
a
fool
of
me
and
to
laugh
at
me
but
this
did
not
move
me
for
meanwhile
i
had
met
with
herr
von
dürkheim
who
in
his
mild
way
brought
me
to
book
with
sundry
graceful
and
humorous
reproaches
i
was
now
awakened
from
my
dream
and
had
an
opportunity
to
express
my
most
sincere
thanks
for
the
favor
intended
me
contrary
to
my
hope
and
expectation
and
to
ask
forgiveness
for
my
blunder
after
i
had
on
good
grounds
determined
to
accept
their
friendly
offers
the
following
arrangement
was
made
a
gentleman
of
the
duke
suite
who
had
stayed
behind
in
carlsruhe
to
wait
for
a
landau
which
was
building
in
strasburg
was
to
be
by
a
certain
day
in
frankfort
and
i
was
to
hold
myself
in
readiness
to
set
off
directly
with
him
for
weimar
the
hearty
and
gracious
farewell
with
which
the
young
sovereigns
took
their
leave
of
me
the
friendly
behaviour
of
the
courtiers
made
me
look
forward
most
anxiously
to
this
journey
for
which
the
road
seemed
so
pleasantly
to
smoothe
itself
but
here
too
accidents
came
in
to
complicate
so
simple
an
arrangement
which
through
my
passionate
impatience
became
still
more
confused
and
was
almost
quite
frustrated
having
announced
the
day
of
my
departure
i
had
taken
leave
of
everybody
and
after
packing
up
in
haste
my
chattels
not
forgetting
my
unprinted
manuscripts
i
waited
anxiously
for
the
hour
which
was
to
bring
the
aforesaid
friend
in
the
new
landau
and
to
carry
me
into
a
new
country
and
into
new
circumstances
the
hour
passed
and
the
day
also
and
i
since
to
avoid
a
second
and
the
being
overrun
with
visits
i
had
given
out
that
i
was
to
depart
early
in
the
morning
i
was
obliged
to
keep
close
to
the
house
and
to
my
own
room
and
had
thus
placed
myself
in
a
peculiar
situation
but
since
solitude
and
a
narrow
space
were
always
favorable
to
me
and
i
was
now
compelled
to
find
some
employment
for
these
hours
i
set
to
work
on
my
egmont
and
brought
it
almost
to
a
close
i
read
over
what
i
wrote
to
my
father
who
had
acquired
a
peculiar
interest
in
this
piece
and
wished
nothing
more
than
to
see
it
finished
and
in
print
since
he
hoped
that
it
would
add
to
his
son
reputation
he
needed
something
of
this
sort
to
keep
him
quiet
and
to
make
him
contented
for
he
was
inclined
to
make
very
grave
comments
on
the
of
the
carriage
he
maintained
that
the
whole
affair
was
a
mere
fiction
would
not
believe
in
any
new
landau
and
pronounced
the
gentleman
who
stayed
behind
to
be
a
phantom
of
the
air
it
was
however
only
indirectly
that
he
gave
me
to
understand
all
this
but
he
only
tormented
himself
and
my
mother
the
more
openly
insisting
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
mere
piece
of
court
pleasantry
which
they
had
practised
upon
me
in
consequence
of
my
former
escapades
and
in
order
to
sicken
and
to
shame
me
had
put
upon
me
a
disgraceful
mockery
instead
of
the
expected
honor
as
to
myself
i
held
fast
to
my
first
faith
and
congratulated
myself
upon
these
solitary
hours
disturbed
by
neither
friends
nor
strangers
nor
by
any
sort
of
social
distraction
i
therefore
wrote
on
vigorously
at
egmont
though
not
without
inward
mortification
and
this
frame
of
mind
perhaps
suited
well
with
the
piece
itself
which
agitated
by
so
many
passions
could
not
very
well
have
been
written
by
one
entirely
passionless
a
disappointment
thus
passed
eight
days
and
i
know
not
how
many
more
when
such
perfect
imprisonment
began
to
prove
irksome
accustomed
for
many
years
to
live
under
the
open
sky
and
to
enter
into
society
on
the
most
frank
and
familiar
terms
in
the
neighbourhood
too
of
one
dearly
beloved
from
whom
indeed
i
had
resolved
to
part
but
from
whom
so
long
as
i
was
within
the
circle
of
her
attraction
i
found
it
difficult
to
absent
myself
all
this
begun
to
make
me
so
uneasy
that
there
was
danger
lest
the
interest
of
my
tragedy
should
suffer
and
my
inventive
powers
be
suspended
through
my
impatience
already
for
several
evenings
i
had
found
it
impossible
to
remain
at
home
disguised
in
a
large
mantle
i
crept
round
the
city
passing
the
houses
of
my
friends
and
acquaintances
and
not
forbearing
to
walk
up
to
lili
window
her
house
was
a
corner
one
and
the
room
she
usually
spent
her
evenings
in
was
on
the
ground
floor
the
green
shades
were
down
but
i
could
easily
remark
that
the
lights
stood
in
their
usual
places
soon
i
heard
her
singing
at
the
piano
it
was
the
song
why
resistless
dost
thou
press
me
which
i
had
written
for
her
hardly
a
year
before
she
seemed
to
me
to
sing
with
more
expression
than
ever
i
could
make
out
every
word
distinctly
for
i
had
placed
my
ear
as
close
as
the
convex
lattice
would
permit
after
she
had
sung
it
through
i
saw
by
the
shadow
which
fell
upon
the
curtain
that
she
got
up
and
walked
backwards
and
forwards
but
i
sought
in
vain
to
catch
the
outline
of
her
lovely
person
through
the
thick
curtains
nothing
but
the
firm
resolve
to
tear
myself
away
and
not
to
afflict
her
with
my
presence
but
actually
to
renounce
her
and
the
thought
of
the
strange
impression
which
would
be
made
by
my
could
have
determined
me
to
leave
so
dear
a
neighbourhood
several
more
days
passed
away
and
my
father
suggestion
seemed
daily
to
become
more
probable
since
not
even
a
letter
arrived
from
carlsruhe
to
explain
the
reasons
of
the
delay
i
was
unable
to
go
on
with
my
poetic
labors
and
now
in
the
uneasiness
with
which
i
was
internally
distracted
my
father
had
the
game
to
himself
he
represented
to
me
that
it
was
now
too
late
to
change
matters
that
my
trunk
was
packed
and
he
would
give
me
money
and
credit
to
go
to
italy
but
i
must
decide
quickly
in
such
a
weighty
affair
i
naturally
doubted
and
hesitated
finally
however
i
agreed
that
if
by
a
certain
hour
neither
carriage
nor
message
came
i
would
set
off
directing
my
steps
first
of
all
to
heidelberg
and
from
there
over
the
alps
not
however
going
through
switzerland
again
but
rather
taking
the
route
through
the
grisons
or
the
tyrol
strange
things
indeed
must
happen
when
a
planless
youth
who
of
himself
is
so
easily
misled
is
also
driven
into
a
false
step
by
a
passionate
error
of
age
but
so
it
is
both
with
youth
and
the
whole
of
life
it
is
not
till
the
campaign
is
over
that
we
learn
to
see
through
its
tactics
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
such
an
accident
were
easy
enough
to
be
explained
but
we
are
always
too
ready
to
conspire
with
error
against
what
is
naturally
probable
just
as
we
shuffle
the
cards
before
we
deal
them
round
in
order
that
chance
may
not
be
deprived
of
its
full
share
in
the
game
it
is
precisely
thus
that
the
element
arises
in
and
upon
which
the
daemonical
so
loves
to
work
and
it
even
sports
with
us
the
more
fearfully
the
clearer
are
the
inklings
we
have
of
its
approach
the
last
day
for
my
waiting
had
arrived
and
the
next
morning
was
fixed
for
my
setting
out
on
my
travels
and
now
i
felt
extremely
anxious
to
see
my
friend
passavant
again
who
had
just
returned
from
switzerland
and
who
would
really
have
had
cause
to
be
offended
if
by
keeping
my
plans
entirely
to
myself
i
had
violated
the
intimate
confidence
which
subsisted
between
us
i
therefore
sent
him
an
anonymous
note
requesting
a
meeting
by
night
at
a
certain
spot
where
i
was
the
first
to
arrive
enveloped
in
my
mantle
but
he
was
not
long
after
me
and
if
he
wondered
at
the
appointment
he
must
have
been
still
more
surprised
to
meet
the
person
he
did
his
joy
however
was
equal
to
the
astonishment
conversation
and
counsel
were
not
to
be
thought
of
he
could
only
wish
me
well
through
my
italian
journey
and
so
we
parted
the
next
day
i
saw
myself
by
good
time
advancing
along
the
mountain
road
heidelberg
mademoiselle
delf
i
had
several
reasons
for
going
to
heidelberg
one
was
very
sensible
and
prudent
for
i
had
heard
that
my
missing
weimar
friend
must
pass
through
heidelberg
from
carlsruhe
and
so
when
we
reached
the
i
left
a
note
which
was
to
be
handed
to
a
cavalier
who
should
pass
through
in
the
carriage
described
the
second
reason
was
one
of
passion
and
bad
reference
to
my
late
attachment
to
lili
in
short
mademoiselle
delf
who
had
been
the
confidante
of
our
love
and
indeed
the
mediator
with
our
respective
parents
for
their
approval
of
our
marriage
lived
there
and
i
prized
it
as
the
greatest
happiness
to
be
able
before
i
left
germany
to
talk
over
those
happy
times
with
a
worthy
patient
and
indulgent
friend
i
was
well
received
and
introduced
into
many
families
among
others
the
family
of
the
high
warden
of
the
forests
von
w
particularly
pleased
me
the
parents
were
dignified
and
easy
in
their
manners
and
one
of
the
daughters
resembled
frederica
it
was
just
the
time
of
vintage
the
weather
beautiful
and
all
my
alsacian
feelings
revived
in
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
rhine
at
this
time
however
my
experience
both
of
myself
and
others
seemed
very
strange
it
was
as
yet
quite
vague
and
undigested
in
my
mind
no
deliberate
judgment
upon
life
had
shaped
itself
before
me
and
whatever
sense
of
the
infinite
had
been
awakened
within
me
served
only
to
confuse
and
perplex
me
the
more
in
society
nevertheless
i
was
as
agreeable
and
entertaining
as
ever
and
possibly
even
still
more
so
here
under
this
free
air
of
heaven
among
joyous
men
i
sought
again
the
old
sports
which
never
lose
their
novelty
and
charm
for
youth
with
an
earlier
and
not
yet
extinguished
love
in
my
heart
i
excited
sympathy
without
seeking
it
even
though
it
sought
no
utterance
of
itself
and
thus
i
soon
became
at
home
in
this
circle
and
indeed
necessary
to
it
and
i
forgot
that
i
had
resolved
after
talking
away
a
couple
of
evenings
to
continue
my
journey
mademoiselle
delf
was
one
of
those
persons
who
without
exactly
intriguing
always
like
to
have
some
business
in
hand
and
to
keep
others
employed
and
to
carry
through
some
object
or
other
she
had
conceived
a
sincere
friendship
for
me
and
prevailed
the
more
easily
on
me
to
prolong
my
visit
as
i
lived
in
her
house
where
she
suggested
all
manner
of
inducements
for
my
stay
and
raised
all
manner
of
obstacles
to
my
journey
when
however
i
wanted
to
turn
the
conversation
to
lili
she
was
not
so
well
pleased
or
so
sympathizing
as
i
had
hoped
on
the
contrary
she
said
that
under
the
circumstances
nothing
could
be
wiser
than
our
resolution
to
part
and
maintained
that
one
must
submit
to
what
is
unavoidable
banish
the
impossible
from
the
mind
and
look
around
for
some
new
object
of
interest
in
life
full
of
plans
as
she
always
was
she
had
not
intended
to
leave
this
matter
to
accident
but
had
already
formed
a
project
for
my
future
conduct
from
which
i
clearly
saw
that
her
recent
invitation
to
heidelberg
had
not
been
so
disinterested
as
it
sounded
she
reminded
me
that
the
electoral
prince
charles
theodore
who
had
done
so
much
for
the
arts
and
sciences
resided
still
at
mannheim
and
that
as
the
court
was
roman
catholic
while
the
country
was
protestant
the
latter
party
was
extremely
anxious
to
strengthen
itself
by
enlisting
the
services
of
able
and
hopeful
men
i
must
now
go
in
name
to
italy
and
there
mature
my
views
of
art
meanwhile
they
would
work
for
me
it
would
on
my
return
soon
be
seen
whether
the
budding
affection
of
fraülein
von
w
had
expanded
or
had
been
nipped
and
whether
it
would
be
politic
through
an
alliance
with
a
respectable
family
to
establish
myself
and
my
fortunes
in
a
new
home
all
these
suggestions
i
did
not
to
be
sure
reject
but
my
planless
nature
could
not
wholly
harmonize
with
the
scheming
spirit
of
my
friend
i
was
gratified
however
with
the
kind
intentions
of
the
moment
while
lili
image
floated
before
me
waking
and
dreaming
and
mingled
with
everything
else
which
afforded
me
pleasure
or
distraction
but
now
i
summoned
before
my
soul
the
serious
import
of
my
great
travelling
plan
and
i
resolved
to
set
myself
free
gently
and
with
propriety
and
in
a
few
days
to
make
known
to
her
my
determination
of
taking
leave
of
her
and
to
resume
my
route
one
night
mademoiselle
delf
had
gone
on
until
late
unfolding
to
me
her
plans
and
all
that
certain
parties
were
disposed
to
do
for
me
and
i
could
not
but
feel
grateful
for
such
sentiments
although
the
scheme
of
strengthening
a
certain
circle
through
me
and
my
possible
influence
at
court
was
manifest
enough
it
was
about
one
when
we
separated
i
soon
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
but
before
very
long
i
was
awakened
by
the
horn
of
a
postilion
who
was
stopping
and
blowing
it
before
the
house
very
soon
mademoiselle
delf
appeared
with
a
light
and
a
letter
in
her
hands
and
coming
up
to
my
she
exclaimed
here
the
letter
read
and
tell
me
what
it
says
surely
it
comes
from
the
weimar
people
if
it
is
an
invitation
do
not
follow
it
but
call
to
mind
our
conversation
i
asked
her
to
give
me
a
light
and
leave
me
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
myself
she
went
away
very
reluctantly
i
remained
thinking
for
some
time
without
opening
the
letter
the
express
then
has
come
from
frankfort
i
know
both
the
seal
and
hand
the
friend
then
has
arrived
there
he
is
still
true
to
his
invitation
and
our
own
want
of
faith
and
incredulity
had
made
us
act
prematurely
why
could
one
not
wait
in
a
quiet
civilized
place
for
a
man
who
had
been
announced
distinctly
but
whose
arrival
might
be
delayed
by
so
many
accidents
the
scales
fell
from
my
eyes
all
the
kindness
the
graciousness
the
confidence
of
the
past
came
up
livingly
before
me
and
i
was
almost
ashamed
of
the
strange
wilful
step
i
had
taken
i
opened
the
letter
and
found
all
that
had
happened
explained
naturally
enough
my
missing
guide
had
waited
for
the
new
landau
which
was
to
come
from
strasburg
day
after
day
hour
after
hour
as
we
had
waited
for
him
then
for
the
sake
of
some
business
he
had
gone
round
by
way
of
mannheim
to
frankfort
and
to
his
dismay
had
not
found
me
there
he
sent
the
hasty
letter
by
express
proposing
that
now
the
mistake
was
explained
i
should
instantly
return
and
save
him
the
shame
of
going
to
weimar
without
me
departure
for
weimar
much
as
my
understanding
and
my
feeling
inclined
me
to
this
side
there
was
still
no
lack
of
weighty
arguments
in
favour
of
my
new
route
my
father
had
laid
out
for
me
a
fine
plan
of
travel
and
had
given
me
a
little
library
which
might
prepare
me
for
the
scenes
i
was
to
visit
and
also
guide
me
on
the
spot
in
my
leisure
hours
i
had
had
no
other
entertainment
than
to
reflect
on
it
and
indeed
during
my
last
short
journey
i
had
thought
of
nothing
else
in
the
coach
those
glorious
objects
which
from
my
youth
up
i
had
become
acquainted
with
histories
and
all
sorts
of
tales
gathered
before
my
soul
and
nothing
seemed
to
me
so
desirable
as
to
visit
them
while
i
was
parting
from
lili
for
ever
as
these
thoughts
passed
through
my
mind
i
had
dressed
myself
and
was
walking
up
and
down
my
chamber
my
anxious
hostess
entered
what
am
i
to
hope
she
cried
dearest
madam
i
answered
say
no
more
on
the
subject
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
return
the
grounds
of
that
conclusion
i
have
well
weighed
and
to
repeat
them
to
you
would
be
wasting
time
a
resolution
must
be
taken
sooner
or
later
and
who
should
take
it
but
the
person
whom
it
most
concerns
i
was
moved
and
so
was
she
and
we
had
an
excited
scene
which
i
cut
short
by
ordering
my
servant
to
engage
a
in
vain
i
begged
my
hostess
to
calm
herself
and
to
turn
the
which
i
took
of
the
company
the
evening
before
into
a
real
one
to
consider
that
it
was
only
a
temporary
visit
a
postponement
for
a
short
time
that
my
italian
journey
was
not
given
up
and
my
return
that
way
was
not
precluded
she
would
listen
to
nothing
and
she
disquieted
her
friend
already
deeply
excited
still
more
the
coach
was
at
the
door
everything
was
packed
and
the
postilion
gave
the
usual
signs
of
impatience
i
tore
myself
away
she
would
not
let
me
go
and
with
so
much
art
brought
up
all
the
arguments
of
the
present
that
finally
impassioned
and
inspired
i
shouted
