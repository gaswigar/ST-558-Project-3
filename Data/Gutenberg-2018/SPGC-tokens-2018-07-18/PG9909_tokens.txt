nightmare
abbey
a
venerable
in
a
highly
picturesque
state
of
pleasantly
situated
on
a
strip
of
dry
land
between
the
sea
and
the
fens
at
the
verge
of
the
county
of
lincoln
had
the
honour
to
be
the
seat
of
christopher
glowry
esquire
this
gentleman
was
naturally
of
an
atrabilarious
temperament
and
much
troubled
with
those
phantoms
of
indigestion
which
are
commonly
called
he
had
been
deceived
in
an
early
friendship
he
had
been
crossed
in
love
and
had
offered
his
hand
from
pique
to
a
lady
who
accepted
it
from
interest
and
who
in
so
doing
violently
tore
asunder
the
bonds
of
a
tried
and
youthful
attachment
her
vanity
was
gratified
by
being
the
mistress
of
a
very
extensive
if
not
very
lively
establishment
but
all
the
springs
of
her
sympathies
were
frozen
riches
she
possessed
but
that
which
enriches
them
the
participation
of
affection
was
wanting
all
that
they
could
purchase
for
her
became
indifferent
to
her
because
that
which
they
could
not
purchase
and
which
was
more
valuable
than
themselves
she
had
for
their
sake
thrown
away
she
discovered
when
it
was
too
late
that
she
had
mistaken
the
means
for
the
end
that
riches
rightly
used
are
instruments
of
happiness
but
are
not
in
themselves
happiness
in
this
wilful
blight
of
her
affections
she
found
them
valueless
as
means
they
had
been
the
end
to
which
she
had
immolated
all
her
affections
and
were
now
the
only
end
that
remained
to
her
she
did
not
confess
this
to
herself
as
a
principle
of
action
but
it
operated
through
the
medium
of
unconscious
and
terminated
in
inveterate
avarice
she
laid
on
external
things
the
blame
of
her
mind
internal
disorder
and
thus
became
by
degrees
an
accomplished
scold
she
often
went
her
daily
rounds
through
a
series
of
deserted
apartments
every
creature
in
the
house
vanishing
at
the
creak
of
her
shoe
much
more
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
to
which
the
nature
of
things
affords
no
simile
for
as
far
as
the
voice
of
woman
when
attuned
by
gentleness
and
love
transcends
all
other
sounds
in
harmony
so
far
does
it
surpass
all
others
in
discord
when
stretched
into
unnatural
shrillness
by
anger
and
impatience
mr
glowry
used
to
say
that
his
house
was
no
better
than
a
spacious
kennel
for
every
one
in
it
led
the
life
of
a
dog
disappointed
both
in
love
and
in
friendship
and
looking
upon
human
learning
as
vanity
he
had
come
to
a
conclusion
that
there
was
but
one
good
thing
in
the
world
a
good
dinner
and
this
his
parsimonious
lady
seldom
suffered
him
to
enjoy
but
one
morning
like
sir
leoline
in
christabel
woke
and
found
his
lady
dead
and
remained
a
very
consolate
widower
with
one
small
child
this
only
son
and
heir
mr
glowry
had
christened
scythrop
from
the
name
of
a
maternal
ancestor
who
had
hanged
himself
one
rainy
day
in
a
fit
of
and
had
been
eulogised
by
a
coroner
jury
in
the
comprehensive
phrase
of
de
on
which
account
mr
glowry
held
his
memory
in
high
honour
and
made
a
punchbowl
of
his
skull
when
scythrop
grew
up
he
was
sent
as
usual
to
a
public
school
where
a
little
learning
was
painfully
beaten
into
him
and
from
thence
to
the
university
where
it
was
carefully
taken
out
of
him
and
he
was
sent
home
like
a
ear
of
corn
with
nothing
in
his
head
having
finished
his
education
to
the
high
satisfaction
of
the
master
and
fellows
of
his
college
who
had
in
testimony
of
their
approbation
presented
him
with
a
silver
on
which
his
name
figured
at
the
head
of
a
laudatory
inscription
in
some
dialect
of
latin
his
however
who
drove
tandem
and
random
in
great
perfection
and
were
connoisseurs
in
good
inns
had
taught
him
to
drink
deep
ere
he
departed
he
had
passed
much
of
his
time
with
these
choice
spirits
and
had
seen
the
rays
of
the
midnight
lamp
tremble
on
many
a
lengthening
file
of
empty
bottles
he
passed
his
vacations
sometimes
at
nightmare
abbey
sometimes
in
london
at
the
house
of
his
uncle
mr
hilary
a
very
cheerful
and
elastic
gentleman
who
had
married
the
sister
of
the
melancholy
mr
glowry
the
company
that
frequented
his
house
was
the
gayest
of
the
gay
scythrop
danced
with
the
ladies
and
drank
with
the
gentlemen
and
was
pronounced
by
both
a
very
accomplished
charming
fellow
and
an
honour
to
the
university
at
the
house
of
mr
hilary
scythrop
first
saw
the
beautiful
miss
emily
girouette
he
fell
in
love
which
is
nothing
new
he
was
favourably
received
which
is
nothing
strange
mr
glowry
and
mr
girouette
had
a
meeting
on
the
occasion
and
quarrelled
about
the
terms
of
the
bargain
which
is
neither
new
nor
strange
the
lovers
were
torn
asunder
weeping
and
vowing
everlasting
constancy
and
in
three
weeks
after
this
tragical
event
the
lady
was
led
a
smiling
bride
to
the
altar
by
the
honourable
mr
lackwit
which
is
neither
strange
nor
new
scythrop
received
this
intelligence
at
nightmare
abbey
and
was
half
distracted
on
the
occasion
it
was
his
first
disappointment
and
preyed
deeply
on
his
sensitive
spirit
his
father
to
comfort
him
read
him
a
commentary
on
ecclesiastes
which
he
had
himself
composed
and
which
demonstrated
incontrovertibly
that
all
is
vanity
he
insisted
particularly
on
the
text
man
among
a
thousand
have
i
found
but
a
woman
amongst
all
those
have
i
not
found
could
he
expect
it
said
scythrop
the
whole
thousand
were
locked
up
in
his
seraglio
his
experience
is
no
precedent
for
a
free
state
of
society
like
that
in
which
we
live
up
or
at
large
said
mr
glowry
result
is
the
same
their
minds
are
always
locked
up
and
vanity
and
interest
keep
the
key
i
speak
feelingly
scythrop
am
sorry
for
it
sir
said
scythrop
how
is
it
that
their
minds
are
locked
up
the
fault
is
in
their
artificial
education
which
studiously
models
them
into
mere
musical
dolls
to
be
set
out
for
sale
in
the
great
of
society
be
sure
said
mr
glowry
education
is
not
so
well
finished
as
yours
has
been
and
your
idea
of
a
musical
doll
is
good
i
bought
one
myself
but
it
was
confoundedly
out
of
tune
but
whatever
be
the
cause
scythrop
the
effect
is
certainly
this
that
one
is
pretty
nearly
as
good
as
another
as
far
as
any
judgment
can
be
formed
of
them
before
marriage
it
is
only
after
marriage
that
they
show
their
true
qualities
as
i
know
by
bitter
experience
marriage
is
therefore
a
lottery
and
the
less
choice
and
selection
a
man
bestows
on
his
ticket
the
better
for
if
he
has
incurred
considerable
pains
and
expense
to
obtain
a
lucky
number
and
his
lucky
number
proves
a
blank
he
experiences
not
a
simple
but
a
complicated
disappointment
the
loss
of
labour
and
money
being
superadded
to
the
disappointment
of
drawing
a
blank
which
constituting
simply
and
entirely
the
grievance
of
him
who
has
chosen
his
ticket
at
random
is
from
its
simplicity
the
more
endurable
this
very
excellent
reasoning
was
thrown
away
upon
scythrop
who
retired
to
his
tower
as
dismal
and
disconsolate
as
before
the
tower
which
scythrop
inhabited
stood
at
the
angle
of
the
abbey
and
on
the
southern
side
the
foot
of
the
tower
opened
on
a
terrace
which
was
called
the
garden
though
nothing
grew
on
it
but
ivy
and
a
few
amphibious
weeds
the
tower
which
was
ruinous
and
full
of
owls
might
with
equal
propriety
have
been
called
the
aviary
this
terrace
or
garden
or
or
the
reader
may
name
it
took
in
an
oblique
view
of
the
open
sea
and
fronted
a
long
tract
of
level
and
a
fine
monotony
of
fens
and
windmills
the
reader
will
judge
from
what
we
have
said
that
this
building
was
a
sort
of
castellated
abbey
and
it
will
probably
occur
to
him
to
inquire
if
it
had
been
one
of
the
of
the
ancient
church
militant
whether
this
was
the
case
or
how
far
it
had
been
indebted
to
the
taste
of
mr
glowry
ancestors
for
any
transmutations
from
its
original
state
are
unfortunately
circumstances
not
within
the
pale
of
our
knowledge
the
tower
contained
the
apartments
of
mr
glowry
the
moat
at
its
base
and
the
fens
beyond
comprised
the
whole
of
his
prospect
this
moat
surrounded
the
abbey
and
was
in
immediate
contact
with
the
walls
on
every
side
but
the
south
the
tower
was
appropriated
to
the
domestics
whom
mr
glowry
always
chose
by
one
of
two
criterions
a
long
face
or
a
dismal
name
his
butler
was
raven
his
steward
was
crow
his
valet
was
skellet
mr
glowry
maintained
that
the
valet
was
of
french
extraction
and
that
his
name
was
squelette
his
grooms
were
mattocks
and
graves
on
one
occasion
being
in
want
of
a
footman
he
received
a
letter
from
a
person
signing
himself
diggory
deathshead
and
lost
no
time
in
securing
this
acquisition
but
on
diggory
arrival
mr
glowry
was
by
the
sight
of
a
round
ruddy
face
and
a
pair
of
laughing
eyes
deathshead
was
always
grinning
not
a
ghastly
smile
but
the
grin
of
a
comic
mask
and
disturbed
the
echoes
of
the
hall
with
so
much
unhallowed
laughter
that
mr
glowry
gave
him
his
discharge
diggory
however
had
staid
long
enough
to
make
conquests
of
all
the
old
gentleman
maids
and
left
him
a
flourishing
colony
of
young
deathsheads
to
join
chorus
with
the
owls
that
had
before
been
the
exclusive
choristers
of
nightmare
abbey
the
main
body
of
the
building
was
divided
into
rooms
of
state
spacious
apartments
for
feasting
and
numerous
for
visitors
who
however
were
few
and
far
between
family
interests
compelled
mr
glowry
to
receive
occasional
visits
from
mr
and
mrs
hilary
who
paid
them
from
the
same
motive
and
as
the
lively
gentleman
on
these
occasions
found
few
conductors
for
his
exuberant
gaiety
he
became
like
a
electric
jar
which
often
exploded
in
some
burst
of
outrageous
merriment
to
the
signal
discomposure
of
mr
glowry
nerves
another
occasional
visitor
much
more
to
mr
glowry
taste
was
mr
flosky
a
very
lachrymose
and
morbid
gentleman
of
some
note
in
the
literary
world
but
in
his
own
estimation
of
much
more
merit
than
name
the
part
of
his
character
which
recommended
him
to
mr
glowry
was
his
very
fine
sense
of
the
grim
and
the
tearful
no
one
could
relate
a
dismal
story
with
so
many
minutiæ
of
supererogatory
wretchedness
no
one
could
call
up
a
and
with
so
many
adjuncts
and
circumstances
of
ghastliness
mystery
was
his
mental
element
he
lived
in
the
midst
of
that
visionary
world
in
which
nothing
is
but
what
is
not
he
dreamed
with
his
eyes
open
and
saw
ghosts
dancing
round
him
at
noontide
he
had
been
in
his
youth
an
enthusiast
for
liberty
and
had
hailed
the
dawn
of
the
french
revolution
as
the
promise
of
a
day
that
was
to
banish
war
and
slavery
and
every
form
of
vice
and
misery
from
the
face
of
the
earth
because
all
this
was
not
done
he
deduced
that
nothing
was
done
and
from
this
deduction
according
to
his
system
of
logic
he
drew
a
conclusion
that
worse
than
nothing
was
done
that
the
overthrow
of
the
feudal
fortresses
of
tyranny
and
superstition
was
the
greatest
calamity
that
had
ever
befallen
mankind
and
that
their
only
hope
now
was
to
rake
the
rubbish
together
and
rebuild
it
without
any
of
those
loopholes
by
which
the
light
had
originally
crept
in
to
qualify
himself
for
a
coadjutor
in
this
laudable
task
he
plunged
into
the
central
opacity
of
kantian
metaphysics
and
lay
several
years
in
transcendental
darkness
till
the
common
daylight
of
common
sense
became
intolerable
to
his
eyes
he
called
the
sun
an
and
exhorted
all
who
would
listen
to
his
friendly
voice
which
were
about
as
many
as
called
save
king
richard
to
shelter
themselves
from
its
delusive
radiance
in
the
obscure
haunt
of
old
philosophy
this
word
old
had
great
charms
for
him
the
good
old
times
were
always
on
his
lips
meaning
the
days
when
polemic
theology
was
in
its
prime
and
rival
prelates
beat
the
drum
ecclesiastic
with
herculean
vigour
till
the
one
wound
up
his
series
of
syllogisms
with
the
very
orthodox
conclusion
of
roasting
the
other
but
the
dearest
friend
of
mr
glowry
and
his
most
welcome
guest
was
mr
toobad
the
manichaean
millenarian
the
twelfth
verse
of
the
twelfth
chapter
of
revelations
was
always
in
his
mouth
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
and
of
the
sea
for
the
devil
is
come
among
you
having
great
wrath
because
he
knoweth
that
he
hath
but
a
short
time
he
maintained
that
the
supreme
dominion
of
the
world
was
for
wise
purposes
given
over
for
a
while
to
the
evil
principle
and
that
this
precise
period
of
time
commonly
called
the
enlightened
age
was
the
point
of
his
plenitude
of
power
he
used
to
add
that
by
and
by
he
would
be
cast
down
and
a
high
and
happy
order
of
things
succeed
but
he
never
omitted
the
saving
clause
in
our
time
which
last
words
were
always
echoed
in
doleful
response
by
the
sympathetic
mr
glowry
another
and
very
frequent
visitor
was
the
reverend
mr
larynx
the
vicar
of
claydyke
a
village
about
ten
miles
distant
a
accommodating
divine
who
was
always
most
obligingly
ready
to
take
a
dinner
and
a
bed
at
the
house
of
any
country
gentleman
in
distress
for
a

shortly
after
the
disastrous
termination
of
scythrop
passion
for
miss
emily
girouette
mr
glowry
found
himself
much
against
his
will
involved
in
a
lawsuit
which
compelled
him
to
dance
attendance
on
the
high
court
of
chancery
scythrop
was
left
alone
at
nightmare
abbey
he
was
a
burnt
child
and
dreaded
the
fire
of
female
eyes
he
wandered
about
the
ample
pile
or
along
the
with
cogitative
faculties
immersed
in
cogibundity
of
cogitation
the
terrace
terminated
at
the
tower
which
as
we
have
said
was
ruinous
and
full
of
owls
here
would
scythrop
take
his
evening
seat
on
a
fallen
fragment
of
mossy
stone
with
his
back
resting
against
the
ruined
wall
a
thick
canopy
of
ivy
with
an
owl
in
it
over
his
head
and
the
sorrows
of
werter
in
his
hand
he
had
some
taste
for
romance
reading
before
he
went
to
the
university
where
we
must
confess
in
justice
to
his
college
he
was
cured
of
the
love
of
reading
in
all
its
shapes
and
the
cure
would
have
been
radical
if
disappointment
in
love
and
total
solitude
had
not
conspired
to
bring
on
a
relapse
he
began
to
devour
romances
and
german
tragedies
and
by
the
recommendation
of
mr
flosky
to
pore
over
ponderous
tomes
of
transcendental
philosophy
which
reconciled
him
to
the
labour
of
studying
them
by
their
mystical
jargon
and
necromantic
imagery
in
the
congenial
solitude
of
nightmare
abbey
the
distempered
ideas
of
metaphysical
romance
and
romantic
metaphysics
had
ample
time
and
space
to
germinate
into
a
fertile
crop
of
chimeras
which
rapidly
shot
up
into
vigorous
and
abundant
vegetation
he
now
became
troubled
with
the
for
reforming
the
he
built
many
castles
in
the
air
and
peopled
them
with
secret
tribunals
and
bands
of
illuminati
who
were
always
the
imaginary
instruments
of
his
projected
regeneration
of
the
human
species
as
he
intended
to
institute
a
perfect
republic
he
invested
himself
with
absolute
sovereignty
over
these
mystical
dispensers
of
liberty
he
slept
with
horrid
mysteries
under
his
pillow
and
dreamed
of
venerable
eleutherarchs
and
ghastly
confederates
holding
midnight
conventions
in
subterranean
caves
he
passed
whole
mornings
in
his
study
immersed
in
gloomy
reverie
stalking
about
the
room
in
his
nightcap
which
he
pulled
over
his
eyes
like
a
cowl
and
folding
his
striped
calico
about
him
like
the
mantle
of
a
conspirator
thus
he
soliloquised
the
result
of
opinion
and
to
opinion
would
be
to
society
knowledge
is
power
it
is
in
the
hands
of
a
few
who
employ
it
to
mislead
the
many
for
their
own
selfish
purposes
of
aggrandisement
and
appropriation
what
if
it
were
in
the
hands
of
a
few
who
should
employ
it
to
lead
the
many
what
if
it
were
universal
and
the
multitude
were
enlightened
no
the
many
must
be
always
in
but
let
them
have
wise
and
honest
conductors
a
few
to
think
and
many
to
act
that
is
the
only
basis
of
perfect
society
so
thought
the
ancient
philosophers
they
had
their
esoterical
and
exoterical
doctrines
so
thinks
the
sublime
kant
who
delivers
his
oracles
in
language
which
none
but
the
initiated
can
comprehend
such
were
the
views
of
those
secret
associations
of
illuminati
which
were
the
terror
of
superstition
and
tyranny
and
which
carefully
selecting
wisdom
and
genius
from
the
great
wilderness
of
society
as
the
bee
selects
honey
from
the
flowers
of
the
thorn
and
the
nettle
bound
all
human
excellence
in
a
chain
which
if
it
had
not
been
prematurely
broken
would
have
commanded
opinion
and
regenerated
the
world
scythrop
proceeded
to
meditate
on
the
practicability
of
reviving
a
confederation
of
regenerators
to
get
a
clear
view
of
his
own
ideas
and
to
feel
the
pulse
of
the
wisdom
and
genius
of
the
age
he
wrote
and
published
a
treatise
in
which
his
meanings
were
carefully
wrapt
up
in
the
monk
hood
of
transcendental
technology
but
filled
with
hints
of
matter
deep
and
dangerous
which
he
thought
would
set
the
whole
nation
in
a
ferment
and
he
awaited
the
result
in
awful
expectation
as
a
miner
who
has
fired
a
train
awaits
the
explosion
of
a
rock
however
he
listened
and
heard
nothing
for
the
explosion
if
any
ensued
was
not
sufficiently
loud
to
shake
a
single
leaf
of
the
ivy
on
the
towers
of
nightmare
abbey
and
some
months
afterwards
he
received
a
letter
from
his
bookseller
informing
him
that
only
seven
copies
had
been
sold
and
concluding
with
a
polite
request
for
the
balance
scythrop
did
not
despair
copies
he
thought
been
sold
seven
is
a
mystical
number
and
the
omen
is
good
let
me
find
the
seven
purchasers
of
my
seven
copies
and
they
shall
be
the
seven
golden
with
which
i
will
illuminate
the
world
scythrop
had
a
certain
portion
of
mechanical
genius
which
his
romantic
projects
tended
to
develope
he
constructed
models
of
cells
and
recesses
sliding
panels
and
secret
passages
that
would
have
baffled
the
skill
of
the
parisian
police
he
took
the
opportunity
of
his
father
absence
to
smuggle
a
dumb
carpenter
into
the
abbey
and
between
them
they
gave
reality
to
one
of
these
models
in
tower
scythrop
foresaw
that
a
great
leader
of
human
regeneration
would
be
involved
in
fearful
dilemmas
and
determined
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
in
general
to
adopt
all
possible
precautions
for
the
preservation
of
himself
the
servants
even
the
women
had
been
tutored
into
silence
profound
stillness
reigned
throughout
and
around
the
abbey
except
when
the
occasional
shutting
of
a
door
would
peal
in
long
reverberations
through
the
galleries
or
the
heavy
tread
of
the
pensive
butler
would
wake
the
hollow
echoes
of
the
hall
scythrop
stalked
about
like
the
grand
inquisitor
and
the
servants
flitted
past
him
like
familiars
in
his
evening
meditations
on
the
terrace
under
the
ivy
of
the
ruined
tower
the
only
sounds
that
came
to
his
ear
were
the
rustling
of
the
wind
in
the
ivy
the
plaintive
voices
of
the
feathered
choristers
the
owls
the
occasional
striking
of
the
abbey
clock
and
the
monotonous
dash
of
the
sea
on
its
low
and
level
shore
in
the
mean
time
he
drank
madeira
and
laid
deep
schemes
for
a
thorough
repair
of
the
crazy
fabric
of
human
nature
chapter
iii
mr
glowry
returned
from
london
with
the
loss
of
his
lawsuit
justice
was
with
him
but
the
law
was
against
him
he
found
scythrop
in
a
mood
most
sympathetically
tragic
and
they
vied
with
each
other
in
enlivening
their
cups
by
lamenting
the
depravity
of
this
degenerate
age
and
occasionally
interspersing
divers
grim
jokes
about
graves
worms
and
epitaphs
mr
glowry
friends
whom
we
have
mentioned
in
the
first
chapter
availed
themselves
of
his
return
to
pay
him
a
simultaneous
visit
at
the
same
time
arrived
scythrop
friend
and
the
honourable
mr
listless
mr
glowry
had
discovered
this
fashionable
young
gentleman
in
london
on
the
rack
of
a
too
easy
chair
and
devoured
with
a
gloomy
and
misanthropical
and
had
pressed
him
so
earnestly
to
take
the
benefit
of
the
pure
country
air
at
nightmare
abbey
that
mr
listless
finding
it
would
give
him
more
trouble
to
refuse
than
to
comply
summoned
his
french
valet
fatout
and
told
him
he
was
going
to
lincolnshire
on
this
simple
hint
fatout
went
to
work
and
the
imperials
were
packed
and
the
was
at
the
door
without
the
honourable
mr
listless
having
said
or
thought
another
syllable
on
the
subject
mr
and
mrs
hilary
brought
with
them
an
orphan
niece
a
daughter
of
mr
glowry
youngest
sister
who
had
made
a
runaway
with
an
irish
officer
the
lady
fortune
disappeared
in
the
first
year
love
by
a
natural
consequence
disappeared
in
the
second
the
irishman
himself
by
a
still
more
natural
consequence
disappeared
in
the
third
mr
glowry
had
allowed
his
sister
an
annuity
and
she
had
lived
in
retirement
with
her
only
daughter
whom
at
her
death
which
had
recently
happened
she
commended
to
the
care
of
mrs
hilary
miss
marionetta
celestina
was
a
very
blooming
and
accomplished
young
lady
being
a
compound
of
the
of
the
and
of
the
of
the
glowries
she
exhibited
in
her
own
character
all
the
diversities
of
an
april
sky
her
hair
was
her
eyes
hazel
and
sparkling
with
a
mild
but
fluctuating
light
her
features
regular
her
lips
full
and
of
equal
size
and
her
person
surpassingly
graceful
she
was
a
proficient
in
music
her
conversation
was
sprightly
but
always
on
subjects
light
in
their
nature
and
limited
in
their
interest
for
moral
sympathies
in
any
general
sense
had
no
place
in
her
mind
she
had
some
coquetry
and
more
caprice
liking
and
disliking
almost
in
the
same
moment
pursuing
an
object
with
earnestness
while
it
seemed
unattainable
and
rejecting
it
when
in
her
power
as
not
worth
the
trouble
of
possession
whether
she
was
touched
with
a
for
her
cousin
scythrop
or
was
merely
curious
to
see
what
effect
the
tender
passion
would
have
on
so
a
person
she
had
not
been
three
days
in
the
abbey
before
she
threw
out
all
the
lures
of
her
beauty
and
accomplishments
to
make
a
prize
of
his
heart
scythrop
proved
an
easy
conquest
the
image
of
miss
emily
girouette
was
already
sufficiently
dimmed
by
the
power
of
philosophy
and
the
exercise
of
reason
for
to
these
influences
or
to
any
influence
but
the
true
one
are
usually
ascribed
the
mental
cures
performed
by
the
great
physician
time
scythrop
romantic
dreams
had
indeed
given
him
many
anticipated
of
combinations
of
beauty
and
intelligence
which
he
had
some
misgivings
were
not
exactly
realised
in
his
cousin
marionetta
but
in
spite
of
these
misgivings
he
soon
became
distractedly
in
love
which
when
the
young
lady
clearly
perceived
she
altered
her
tactics
and
assumed
as
much
coldness
and
reserve
as
she
had
before
shown
ardent
and
ingenuous
attachment
scythrop
was
confounded
at
the
sudden
change
but
instead
of
falling
at
her
feet
and
requesting
an
explanation
he
retreated
to
his
tower
muffled
himself
in
his
nightcap
seated
himself
in
the
president
chair
of
his
imaginary
secret
tribunal
summoned
marionetta
with
all
terrible
formalities
frightened
her
out
of
her
wits
disclosed
himself
and
clasped
the
beautiful
penitent
to
his
bosom
while
he
was
acting
this
reverie
in
the
moment
in
which
the
awful
president
of
the
secret
tribunal
was
throwing
back
his
cowl
and
his
mantle
and
discovering
himself
to
the
lovely
culprit
as
her
adoring
and
magnanimous
lover
the
door
of
the
study
opened
and
the
real
marionetta
appeared
the
motives
which
had
led
her
to
the
tower
were
a
little
penitence
a
little
concern
a
little
affection
and
a
little
fear
as
to
what
the
sudden
secession
of
scythrop
occasioned
by
her
sudden
change
of
manner
might
portend
she
had
tapped
several
times
unheard
and
of
course
unanswered
and
at
length
timidly
and
cautiously
opening
the
door
she
discovered
him
standing
up
before
a
black
velvet
chair
which
was
mounted
on
an
old
oak
table
in
the
act
of
throwing
open
his
striped
calico
and
flinging
away
his
nightcap
which
is
what
the
french
call
an
imposing
attitude
each
stood
a
few
moments
fixed
in
their
respective
places
the
lady
in
astonishment
and
the
gentleman
in
confusion
marionetta
was
the
first
to
break
silence
heaven
sake
said
she
dear
scythrop
what
is
the
matter
heaven
sake
indeed
said
scythrop
springing
from
the
table
your
sake
marionetta
and
you
are
my
heaven
distraction
is
the
matter
i
adore
you
marionetta
and
your
cruelty
drives
me
mad
he
threw
himself
at
her
knees
devoured
her
hand
with
kisses
and
breathed
a
thousand
vows
in
the
most
passionate
language
of
romance
marionetta
listened
a
long
time
in
silence
till
her
lover
had
exhausted
his
eloquence
and
paused
for
a
reply
she
then
said
with
a
very
arch
look
prithee
deliver
thyself
like
a
man
of
this
world
the
levity
of
this
quotation
and
of
the
manner
in
which
it
was
delivered
jarred
so
discordantly
on
the
enthusiasm
of
the
romantic
inamorato
that
he
sprang
upon
his
feet
and
beat
his
forehead
with
his
clenched
fist
the
young
lady
was
terrified
and
deeming
it
expedient
to
soothe
him
took
one
of
his
hands
in
hers
placed
the
other
hand
on
his
shoulder
looked
up
in
his
face
with
a
winning
seriousness
and
said
in
the
tenderest
possible
tone
would
you
have
scythrop
scythrop
was
in
heaven
again
would
i
have
what
but
you
marionetta
you
for
the
companion
of
my
studies
the
partner
of
my
thoughts
the
auxiliary
of
my
great
designs
for
the
emancipation
of
mankind
am
afraid
i
should
be
but
a
poor
auxiliary
scythrop
what
would
you
have
me
do
as
rosalia
does
with
carlos
divine
marionetta
let
us
each
open
a
vein
in
the
other
arm
mix
our
blood
in
a
bowl
and
drink
it
as
a
sacrament
of
love
then
we
shall
see
visions
of
transcendental
illumination
and
soar
on
the
wings
of
ideas
into
the
space
of
pure
intelligence
marionetta
could
not
reply
she
had
not
so
strong
a
stomach
as
rosalia
and
turned
sick
at
the
proposition
she
disengaged
herself
suddenly
from
scythrop
sprang
through
the
door
of
the
tower
and
fled
with
precipitation
along
the
corridors
scythrop
pursued
her
crying
stop
marionetta
my
life
my
love
and
was
gaining
rapidly
on
her
flight
when
at
an
corner
where
two
corridors
ended
in
an
angle
at
the
head
of
a
staircase
he
came
into
sudden
and
violent
contact
with
mr
toobad
and
they
both
plunged
together
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
like
two
into
one
pocket
this
gave
the
young
lady
time
to
escape
and
enclose
herself
in
her
chamber
while
mr
toobad
rising
slowly
and
rubbing
his
knees
and
shoulders
said
see
my
dear
scythrop
in
this
little
incident
one
of
the
innumerable
proofs
of
the
temporary
supremacy
of
the
devil
for
what
but
a
systematic
design
and
concurrent
contrivance
of
evil
could
have
made
the
angles
of
time
and
place
coincide
in
our
unfortunate
persons
at
the
head
of
this
accursed
staircase
else
certainly
said
scythrop
are
perfectly
in
the
right
mr
toobad
evil
and
mischief
and
misery
and
confusion
and
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
and
death
and
disease
and
assassination
and
war
and
poverty
and
pestilence
and
famine
and
avarice
and
selfishness
and
rancour
and
jealousy
and
spleen
and
malevolence
and
the
disappointments
of
philanthropy
and
the
faithlessness
of
friendship
and
the
crosses
of
love
all
prove
the
accuracy
of
your
views
and
the
truth
of
your
system
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
infernal
interruption
of
this
fall
downstairs
may
throw
a
colour
of
evil
on
the
whole
of
my
future
existence
dear
boy
said
mr
toobad
have
a
fine
eye
for
consequences
so
saying
he
embraced
scythrop
who
retired
with
a
disconsolate
step
to
dress
for
dinner
while
mr
toobad
stalked
across
the
hall
repeating
to
the
inhabiters
of
the
earth
and
of
the
sea
for
the
devil
is
come
among
you
having
great
wrath
chapter
iv
the
flight
of
marionetta
and
the
pursuit
of
scythrop
had
been
witnessed
by
mr
glowry
who
in
consequence
narrowly
observed
his
son
and
his
niece
in
the
evening
and
concluding
from
their
manner
that
there
was
a
better
understanding
between
them
than
he
wished
to
see
he
determined
on
obtaining
the
next
morning
from
scythrop
a
full
and
satisfactory
explanation
he
therefore
shortly
after
breakfast
entered
scythrop
tower
with
a
very
grave
face
and
said
without
ceremony
or
preface
sir
you
are
in
love
with
your
cousin
scythrop
with
as
little
hesitation
answered
sir
is
candid
at
least
and
she
is
in
love
with
you
wish
she
were
sir
know
she
is
sir
sir
i
do
not
you
hope
she
is
do
from
my
soul
that
is
very
provoking
scythrop
and
very
disappointing
i
could
not
have
supposed
that
you
scythrop
glowry
of
nightmare
abbey
would
have
been
infatuated
with
such
a
dancing
laughing
singing
thoughtless
careless
thing
as
marionetta
in
all
respects
the
reverse
of
you
and
me
it
is
very
disappointing
scythrop
and
do
you
know
sir
that
marionetta
has
no
fortune
is
the
more
reason
sir
that
her
husband
should
have
one
more
reason
for
her
but
not
for
you
my
wife
had
no
fortune
and
i
had
no
consolation
in
my
calamity
and
do
you
reflect
sir
what
an
enormous
slice
this
lawsuit
has
cut
out
of
our
family
estate
we
who
used
to
be
the
greatest
landed
proprietors
in
lincolnshire
be
sure
sir
we
had
more
acres
of
fen
than
any
man
on
this
coast
but
what
are
fens
to
love
what
are
dykes
and
windmills
to
marionetta
what
sir
is
love
to
a
windmill
not
grist
i
am
certain
besides
sir
i
have
made
a
choice
for
you
i
have
made
a
choice
for
you
scythrop
beauty
genius
accomplishments
and
a
great
fortune
into
the
bargain
such
a
lovely
serious
creature
in
a
fine
state
of
high
dissatisfaction
with
the
world
and
every
thing
in
it
such
a
delightful
surprise
i
had
prepared
for
you
sir
i
have
pledged
my
honour
to
the
contract
the
honour
of
the
glowries
of
nightmare
abbey
and
now
sir
what
is
to
be
done
sir
i
can
not
say
i
claim
on
this
occasion
that
liberty
of
action
which
is
the
prerogative
of
every
rational
being
of
action
sir
there
is
no
such
thing
as
liberty
of
action
we
are
all
slaves
and
puppets
of
a
blind
and
unpathetic
necessity
true
sir
but
liberty
of
action
between
individuals
consists
in
their
being
differently
influenced
or
modified
by
the
same
universal
necessity
so
that
the
results
are
unconsentaneous
and
their
respective
necessitated
volitions
clash
and
fly
off
in
a
tangent
logic
is
good
sir
but
you
are
aware
too
that
one
individual
may
be
a
medium
of
adhibiting
to
another
a
mode
or
form
of
necessity
which
may
have
more
or
less
influence
in
the
production
of
consentaneity
and
therefore
sir
if
you
do
not
comply
with
my
wishes
in
this
instance
you
have
had
your
own
way
in
every
thing
else
i
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
disinheriting
you
though
i
shall
do
it
with
tears
in
my
eyes
having
said
these
words
he
vanished
suddenly
in
the
dread
of
scythrop
logic
mr
glowry
immediately
sought
mrs
hilary
and
communicated
to
her
his
views
of
the
case
in
point
mrs
hilary
as
the
phrase
is
was
as
fond
of
marionetta
as
if
she
had
been
her
own
child
but
there
is
always
a
on
these
occasions
she
could
do
nothing
for
her
in
the
way
of
fortune
as
she
had
two
hopeful
sons
who
were
finishing
their
education
at
and
who
would
not
like
to
encounter
any
diminution
of
their
prospects
when
they
should
be
brought
out
of
the
house
of
mental
bondage
the
university
to
the
land
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
the
west
end
of
london
mrs
hilary
hinted
to
marionetta
that
propriety
and
delicacy
and
decorum
and
dignity
would
require
them
to
leave
the
abbey
immediately
marionetta
listened
in
silent
submission
for
she
knew
that
her
inheritance
was
passive
obedience
but
when
scythrop
who
had
watched
the
opportunity
of
mrs
hilary
departure
entered
and
without
speaking
a
word
threw
himself
at
her
feet
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
the
young
lady
in
equal
silence
and
sorrow
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
burst
into
tears
a
very
tender
scene
ensued
which
the
sympathetic
susceptibilities
of
the
reader
can
more
accurately
imagine
than
we
can
delineate
but
when
marionetta
hinted
that
she
was
to
leave
the
abbey
immediately
scythrop
snatched
from
its
repository
his
ancestor
skull
filled
it
with
madeira
and
presenting
himself
before
mr
glowry
threatened
to
drink
off
the
contents
if
mr
glowry
did
not
immediately
promise
that
marionetta
should
not
be
taken
from
the
abbey
without
her
own
consent
mr
glowry
who
took
the
madeira
to
be
some
deadly
brewage
gave
the
required
promise
in
dismal
panic
scythrop
returned
to
marionetta
with
a
joyful
heart
and
drank
the
madeira
by
the
way
mr
glowry
during
his
residence
in
london
had
come
to
an
agreement
with
his
friend
mr
toobad
that
a
match
between
scythrop
and
mr
toobad
daughter
would
be
a
very
desirable
occurrence
she
was
finishing
her
education
in
a
german
convent
but
mr
toobad
described
her
as
being
fully
impressed
with
the
truth
of
his
ahrimanic
philosophy
and
being
altogether
as
gloomy
and
antithalian
a
young
lady
as
mr
glowry
himself
could
desire
for
the
future
mistress
of
nightmare
abbey
she
had
a
great
fortune
in
her
own
right
which
was
not
as
we
have
seen
without
its
weight
in
inducing
mr
glowry
to
set
his
heart
upon
her
as
his
that
was
to
be
he
was
therefore
very
much
disturbed
by
scythrop
untoward
attachment
to
marionetta
he
condoled
on
the
occasion
with
mr
toobad
who
said
that
he
had
been
too
long
accustomed
to
the
intermeddling
of
the
devil
in
all
his
affairs
to
be
astonished
at
this
new
trace
of
his
cloven
claw
but
that
he
hoped
to
outwit
him
yet
for
he
was
sure
there
could
be
no
comparison
between
his
daughter
and
marionetta
in
the
mind
of
any
one
who
had
a
proper
perception
of
the
fact
that
the
world
being
a
great
theatre
of
evil
seriousness
and
solemnity
are
the
characteristics
of
wisdom
and
laughter
and
merriment
make
a
human
being
no
better
than
a
baboon
mr
glowry
comforted
himself
with
this
view
of
the
subject
and
urged
mr
toobad
to
expedite
his
return
from
germany
mr
toobad
said
he
was
in
daily
expectation
of
her
arrival
in
london
and
would
set
off
immediately
to
meet
her
that
he
might
lose
no
time
in
bringing
her
to
nightmare
abbey
he
added
shall
see
whether
thalia
or
melpomene
whether
the
allegra
or
the
penserosa
will
carry
off
the
symbol
of
victory
can
be
no
doubt
said
mr
glowry
way
the
scale
will
incline
or
scythrop
is
no
true
scion
of
the
venerable
stem
of
the
glowries
chapter
v
marionetta
felt
secure
of
scythrop
heart
and
notwithstanding
the
difficulties
that
surrounded
her
she
could
not
debar
herself
from
the
pleasure
of
tormenting
her
lover
whom
she
kept
in
a
perpetual
fever
sometimes
she
would
meet
him
with
the
most
unqualified
affection
sometimes
with
the
most
chilling
indifference
rousing
him
to
anger
by
artificial
coldness
softening
him
to
love
by
eloquent
tenderness
or
inflaming
him
to
jealousy
by
coquetting
with
the
honourable
mr
listless
who
seemed
under
her
magical
influence
to
burst
into
sudden
life
like
the
bud
of
the
evening
primrose
sometimes
she
would
sit
by
the
piano
and
listen
with
becoming
attention
to
pathetic
remonstrances
but
in
the
most
impassioned
part
of
his
oratory
she
would
convert
all
his
ideas
into
a
chaos
by
striking
up
some
rondo
allegro
and
saying
it
not
pretty
scythrop
would
begin
to
storm
and
she
would
answer
him
with
zitti
piano
piano
non
facciamo
confusione
or
some
similar
till
he
would
start
away
from
her
and
enclose
himself
in
his
tower
in
an
agony
of
agitation
vowing
to
renounce
her
and
her
whole
sex
for
ever
and
returning
to
her
presence
at
the
summons
of
the
billet
which
she
never
failed
to
send
with
many
expressions
of
penitence
and
promises
of
amendment
scythrop
schemes
for
regenerating
the
world
and
detecting
his
seven
golden
went
on
very
slowly
in
this
fever
of
his
spirit
things
proceeded
in
this
train
for
several
days
and
mr
glowry
began
to
be
uneasy
at
receiving
no
intelligence
from
mr
toobad
when
one
evening
the
latter
rushed
into
the
library
where
the
family
and
the
visitors
were
assembled
vociferating
devil
is
come
among
you
having
great
wrath
he
then
drew
mr
glowry
aside
into
another
apartment
and
after
remaining
some
time
together
they
the
library
with
faces
of
great
dismay
but
did
not
condescend
to
explain
to
any
one
the
cause
of
their
discomfiture
the
next
morning
early
mr
toobad
departed
mr
glowry
sighed
and
groaned
all
day
and
said
not
a
word
to
any
one
scythrop
had
quarrelled
as
usual
with
marionetta
and
was
enclosed
in
his
tower
in
a
fit
of
morbid
sensibility
marionetta
was
comforting
herself
at
the
piano
with
singing
the
airs
of
pazza
per
and
the
honourable
mr
listless
was
listening
to
the
harmony
as
he
lay
supine
on
the
sofa
with
a
book
in
his
hand
into
which
he
peeped
at
intervals
the
reverend
mr
larynx
approached
the
sofa
and
proposed
a
game
at
billiards
the
honourable
mr
listless
billiards
really
i
should
be
very
happy
but
in
my
present
exhausted
state
the
exertion
is
too
much
for
me
i
do
not
know
when
i
have
been
equal
to
such
an
effort
rang
the
bell
for
his
valet

every
thing

something
mr

the
reverend
mr

most
assuredly
miss
for
however
reasoners
may
dispute
about
the
none
of
them
will
deny
that
a
very
good
dinner
is
a
very
good
thing
and
what
is
a
good
dinner
without
a
good
appetite
and
whence
is
a
good
appetite
but
from
good
health
now
cheltenham
mr
listless
is
famous
for
good
appetites
the
honourable
mr
listless
the
best
piece
of
logic
i
ever
heard
mr
larynx
the
very
best
i
assure
you
i
have
thought
very
seriously
of
cheltenham
very
seriously
and
profoundly
i
thought
of
it
let
me
see
when
did
i
think
of
it
rang
again
and
fatout
fatout
when
did
i
think

monsieur
the
honourable
mr
listless
so

an
invaluable
fellow

you
as
a
walking
memory

be
a
living
chronicle

of
your
actions

your

been
sent

summoned
to
unpack
it
and
it
proved
to
contain
a
new
novel
and
a
new
poem
both
of
which
had
long
been
anxiously
expected
by
the
whole
host
of
fashionable
readers
and
the
last
number
of
a
popular
review
of
which
the
editor
and
his
coadjutors
were
in
high
favour
at

enjoyed
ample

mr

the
the
reverend
mr

for
a
young
man
of
fashion
and
family
mr
listless
you
seem
to
be
of
a
very
studious
turn
the
honourable
mr
listless
studious
you
are
pleased
to
be
facetious
mr
larynx
i
hope
you
do
not
suspect
me
of
being
studious
i
have
finished
my
education
but
there
are
some
fashionable
books
that
one
must
read
because
they
are
ingredients
of
the
talk
of
the
day
otherwise
i
am
no
fonder
of
books
than
i
dare
say
you
yourself
are
mr
larynx
the
reverend
mr
larynx
why
sir
i
can
not
say
that
i
am
indeed
particularly
fond
of
books
yet
neither
can
i
say
that
i
never
do
read
a
tale
or
a
poem
now
and
then
to
a
circle
of
ladies
over
their
work
is
no
very
heterodox
employment
of
the
vocal
energy
and
i
must
say
for
myself
that
few
men
have
a
more
endurance
of
the
eternally
recurring
questions
and
answers
that
interweave
themselves
on
these
occasions
with
the
crisis
of
an
adventure
and
heighten
the
distress
of
a
tragedy
the
honourable
mr
listless
and
very
often
make
the
distress
when
the
author
has
omitted
it
marionetta
i
shall
try
your
patience
some
rainy
morning
mr
larynx
and
mr
listless
shall
recommend
us
the
very
newest
new
book
that
every
body
reads
the
honourable
mr
listless
you
shall
receive
it
miss
with
all
the
gloss
of
novelty
fresh
as
a
ripe
in
all
the
downiness
of
its
bloom
a
copy
from
edinburgh
forwarded
express
from
london
mr
flosky
this
rage
for
novelty
is
the
bane
of
literature
except
my
works
and
those
of
my
particular
friends
nothing
is
good
that
is
not
as
old
as
jeremy
taylor
and
the
best
parts
of
my
friends
books
were
either
written
or
suggested
by
myself
the
honourable
mr
listless
sir
i
reverence
you
but
i
must
say
modern
books
are
very
consolatory
and
congenial
to
my
feelings
there
is
as
it
were
a
delightful
wind
an
intellectual
blight
breathing
through
them
a
delicious
misanthropy
and
discontent
that
demonstrates
the
nullity
of
virtue
and
energy
and
puts
me
in
good
humour
with
myself
and
my
sofa
mr
flosky
very
true
sir
modern
literature
is
a
wind
a
blight
of
the
human
soul
i
take
credit
to
myself
for
having
helped
to
make
it
so
the
way
to
produce
fine
fruit
is
to
blight
the
flower
you
call
this
a
paradox
marry
so
be
it
ponder
thereon
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
of
mr
toobad
covered
with
mud
he
just
showed
himself
at
the
door
muttered
devil
is
come
among
you
and
vanished
the
road
which
connected
nightmare
abbey
with
the
civilised
world
was
artificially
raised
above
the
level
of
the
fens
and
ran
through
them
in
a
straight
line
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
with
a
ditch
on
each
side
of
which
the
water
was
rendered
invisible
by
the
aquatic
vegetation
that
covered
the
surface
into
one
of
these
ditches
the
sudden
action
of
a
shy
horse
which
took
fright
at
a
windmill
had
precipitated
the
travelling
chariot
of
mr
toobad
who
had
been
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
scrambling
in
dismal
plight
through
the
window
one
of
the
wheels
was
found
to
be
broken
and
mr
toobad
leaving
the
postilion
to
get
the
chariot
as
well
as
he
could
to
claydyke
for
the
purpose
of
cleaning
and
repairing
had
walked
back
to
nightmare
abbey
followed
by
his
servant
with
the
imperial
and
repeating
all
the
way
his
favourite
quotation
from
the
revelations
chapter
vi
mr
toobad
had
found
his
daughter
celinda
in
london
and
after
the
first
joy
of
meeting
was
over
told
her
he
had
a
husband
ready
for
her
the
young
lady
replied
very
gravely
that
she
should
take
the
liberty
to
choose
for
herself
mr
toobad
said
he
saw
the
devil
was
determined
to
interfere
with
all
his
projects
but
he
was
resolved
on
his
own
part
not
to
have
on
his
conscience
the
crime
of
passive
obedience
and
to
lucifer
and
therefore
she
should
marry
the
person
he
had
chosen
for
her
miss
toobad
replied
she
assuredly
would
not
celinda
said
mr
toobad
most
assuredly
shall
i
not
a
fortune
in
my
own
right
sir
said
celinda
more
is
the
pity
said
mr
toobad
i
can
find
means
miss
i
can
find
means
there
are
more
ways
than
one
of
breaking
in
obstinate
girls
they
parted
for
the
night
with
the
expression
of
opposite
resolutions
and
in
the
morning
the
young
lady
chamber
was
found
empty
and
what
was
become
of
her
mr
toobad
had
no
clue
to
conjecture
he
continued
to
investigate
town
and
country
in
search
of
her
visiting
and
revisiting
nightmare
abbey
at
intervals
to
consult
with
his
friend
mr
glowry
mr
glowry
agreed
with
mr
toobad
that
this
was
a
very
flagrant
instance
of
filial
disobedience
and
rebellion
and
mr
toobad
declared
that
when
he
discovered
the
fugitive
she
should
find
that
devil
was
come
unto
her
having
great
wrath
in
the
evening
the
whole
party
met
as
usual
in
the
library
marionetta
sat
at
the
harp
the
honourable
mr
listless
sat
by
her
and
turned
over
her
music
though
the
exertion
was
almost
too
much
for
him
the
reverend
mr
larynx
relieved
him
occasionally
in
this
delightful
labour
scythrop
tormented
by
the
demon
jealousy
sat
in
the
corner
biting
his
lips
and
fingers
marionetta
looked
at
him
every
now
and
then
with
a
smile
of
most
provoking
good
humour
which
he
pretended
not
to
see
and
which
only
the
more
exasperated
his
troubled
spirit
he
took
down
a
volume
of
dante
and
pretended
to
be
deeply
interested
in
the
purgatorio
though
he
knew
not
a
word
he
was
reading
as
marionetta
was
well
aware
who
tripping
across
the
room
peeped
into
his
book
and
said
to
him
see
you
are
in
the
middle
of
purgatory
am
in
the
middle
of
hell
said
scythrop
furiously
you
said
she
come
across
the
room
and
i
will
sing
you
the
finale
of
don
giovanni
me
alone
said
scythrop
marionetta
looked
at
him
with
a
deprecating
smile
and
said
unjust
cross
creature
you
me
alone
said
scythrop
but
much
less
emphatically
than
at
first
and
by
no
means
wishing
to
be
taken
at
his
word
marionetta
left
him
immediately
and
returning
to
the
harp
said
just
loud
enough
for
scythrop
to
hear
you
ever
read
dante
mr
listless
scythrop
is
reading
dante
and
is
just
now
in
purgatory
i
said
the
honourable
mr
listless
not
reading
dante
and
am
just
now
in
paradise
bowing
to
marionetta
marionetta
you
are
very
gallant
mr
listless
and
i
dare
say
you
are
very
fond
of
reading
dante
the
honourable
mr
listless
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
dante
never
came
in
my
way
till
lately
i
never
had
him
in
my
collection
and
if
i
had
had
him
i
should
not
have
read
him
but
i
find
he
is
growing
fashionable
and
i
am
afraid
i
must
read
him
some
wet
morning
marionetta
no
read
him
some
evening
by
all
means
were
you
ever
in
love
mr
listless
the
honourable
mr
listless
i
assure
you
miss
never
till
i
came
to
nightmare
abbey
i
dare
say
it
is
very
pleasant
but
it
seems
to
give
so
much
trouble
that
i
fear
the
exertion
would
be
too
much
for
me
marionetta
shall
i
teach
you
a
compendious
method
of
courtship
that
will
give
you
no
trouble
whatever
the
honourable
mr
listless
you
will
confer
on
me
an
inexpressible
obligation
i
am
all
impatience
to
learn
it
marionetta
sit
with
your
back
to
the
lady
and
read
dante
only
be
sure
to
begin
in
the
middle
and
turn
over
three
or
four
pages
at
once
backwards
as
well
as
forwards
and
she
will
immediately
perceive
that
you
are
desperately
in
love
with
her
desperately
the
honourable
mr
listless
sitting
between
scythrop
and
marionetta
and
fixing
all
his
attention
on
the
beautiful
speaker
did
not
observe
scythrop
who
was
doing
as
she
described
the
honourable
mr
listless
you
are
pleased
to
be
facetious
miss
the
lady
would
infallibly
conclude
that
i
was
the
greatest
brute
in
town
marionetta
far
from
it
she
would
say
perhaps
some
people
have
odd
methods
of
showing
their
affection
the
honourable
mr
listless
but
i
should
think
with
submission
mr
flosky
them
from
another
part
of
the
did
i
not
hear
mr
listless
observe
that
dante
is
becoming
fashionable
the
honourable
mr
listless
i
did
hazard
a
remark
to
that
effect
mr
flosky
though
i
speak
on
such
subjects
with
a
consciousness
of
my
own
nothingness
in
the
presence
of
so
great
a
man
as
mr
flosky
i
know
not
what
is
the
colour
of
dante
devils
but
as
he
is
certainly
becoming
fashionable
i
conclude
they
are
blue
for
the
blue
devils
as
it
seems
to
me
mr
flosky
constitute
the
fundamental
feature
of
fashionable
literature
mr
flosky
the
blue
are
indeed
the
staple
commodity
but
as
they
will
not
always
be
commanded
the
black
red
and
grey
may
be
admitted
as
substitutes
tea
late
dinners
and
the
french
revolution
have
played
the
devil
mr
listless
and
brought
the
devil
into
play
mr
toobad
having
great
wrath
mr
flosky
this
is
no
play
upon
words
but
the
sober
sadness
of
veritable
fact
the
honourable
mr
listless
tea
late
dinners
and
the
french
revolution
i
can
not
exactly
see
the
connection
of
ideas
mr
flosky
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
could
i
pity
the
man
who
can
see
the
connection
of
his
own
ideas
still
more
do
i
pity
him
the
connection
of
whose
ideas
any
other
person
can
see
sir
the
great
evil
is
that
there
is
too
much
light
in
our
moral
and
political
literature
and
light
is
a
great
enemy
to
mystery
and
mystery
is
a
great
friend
to
enthusiasm
now
the
enthusiasm
for
abstract
truth
is
an
exceedingly
fine
thing
as
long
as
the
truth
which
is
the
object
of
the
enthusiasm
is
so
completely
abstract
as
to
be
altogether
out
of
the
reach
of
the
human
faculties
and
in
that
sense
i
have
myself
an
enthusiasm
for
truth
but
in
no
other
for
the
pleasure
of
metaphysical
investigation
lies
in
the
means
not
in
the
end
and
if
the
end
could
be
found
the
pleasure
of
the
means
would
cease
the
mind
to
be
kept
in
health
must
be
kept
in
exercise
the
proper
exercise
of
the
mind
is
elaborate
reasoning
analytical
reasoning
is
a
base
and
mechanical
process
which
takes
to
pieces
and
examines
bit
by
bit
the
rude
material
of
knowledge
and
extracts
therefrom
a
few
hard
and
obstinate
things
called
facts
every
thing
in
the
shape
of
which
i
cordially
hate
but
synthetical
reasoning
setting
up
as
its
goal
some
unattainable
abstraction
like
an
imaginary
quantity
in
algebra
and
commencing
its
course
with
taking
for
granted
some
two
assertions
which
can
not
be
proved
from
the
union
of
these
two
assumed
truths
produces
a
third
assumption
and
so
on
in
infinite
series
to
the
unspeakable
benefit
of
the
human
intellect
the
beauty
of
this
process
is
that
at
every
step
it
strikes
out
into
two
branches
in
a
compound
ratio
of
ramification
so
that
you
are
perfectly
sure
of
losing
your
way
and
keeping
your
mind
in
perfect
health
by
the
perpetual
exercise
of
an
interminable
quest
and
for
these
reasons
i
have
christened
my
eldest
son
emanuel
kant
flosky
the
reverend
mr
larynx
nothing
can
be
more
luminous
the
honourable
mr
listless
and
what
has
all
that
to
do
with
dante
and
the
blue
devils
mr
hilary
not
much
i
should
think
with
dante
but
a
great
deal
with
the
blue
devils
mr
flosky
it
is
very
certain
and
much
to
be
rejoiced
at
that
our
literature
is
tea
has
shattered
our
nerves
late
dinners
make
us
slaves
of
indigestion
the
french
revolution
has
made
us
shrink
from
the
name
of
philosophy
and
has
destroyed
in
the
more
refined
part
of
the
community
of
which
number
i
am
one
all
enthusiasm
for
political
liberty
that
part
of
the
which
shuns
the
solid
food
of
reason
for
the
light
diet
of
fiction
requires
a
perpetual
adhibition
of
to
the
palate
of
its
depraved
imagination
it
lived
upon
ghosts
goblins
and
skeletons
i
and
my
friend
mr
sackbut
served
up
a
few
of
the
best
till
even
the
devil
himself
though
magnified
to
the
size
of
mount
athos
became
too
base
common
and
popular
for
its
surfeited
appetite
the
ghosts
have
therefore
been
laid
and
the
devil
has
been
cast
into
outer
darkness
and
now
the
delight
of
our
spirits
is
to
dwell
on
all
the
vices
and
blackest
passions
of
our
nature
tricked
out
in
a
masquerade
dress
of
heroism
and
disappointed
benevolence
the
whole
secret
of
which
lies
in
forming
combinations
that
contradict
all
our
experience
and
affixing
the
purple
shred
of
some
particular
virtue
to
that
precise
character
in
which
we
should
be
most
certain
not
to
find
it
in
the
living
world
and
making
this
single
virtue
not
only
redeem
all
the
real
and
manifest
vices
of
the
character
but
make
them
actually
pass
for
necessary
adjuncts
and
indispensable
accompaniments
and
characteristics
of
the
said
virtue
mr
toobad
that
is
because
the
devil
is
come
among
us
and
finds
it
for
his
interest
to
destroy
all
our
perceptions
of
the
distinctions
of
right
and
wrong
marionetta
i
do
not
precisely
enter
into
your
meaning
mr
flosky
and
should
be
glad
if
you
would
make
it
a
little
more
plain
to
me
mr
flosky
one
or
two
examples
will
do
it
miss
if
i
were
to
take
all
the
mean
and
sordid
qualities
of
a
jew
and
tack
on
to
them
as
with
a
nail
the
quality
of
extreme
benevolence
i
should
have
a
very
decent
hero
for
a
modern
novel
and
should
contribute
my
quota
to
the
fashionable
method
of
administering
a
mass
of
vice
under
a
thin
and
unnatural
covering
of
virtue
like
a
spider
wrapt
in
a
bit
of
gold
leaf
and
administered
as
a
wholesome
pill
on
the
same
principle
if
a
man
knocks
me
down
and
takes
my
purse
and
watch
by
main
force
i
turn
him
to
account
and
set
him
forth
in
a
tragedy
as
a
dashing
young
fellow
disinherited
for
his
romantic
generosity
and
full
of
a
most
amiable
hatred
of
the
world
in
general
and
his
own
country
in
particular
and
of
a
most
enlightened
and
chivalrous
affection
for
himself
then
with
the
addition
of
a
wild
girl
to
fall
in
love
with
him
and
a
series
of
adventures
in
which
they
break
all
the
ten
commandments
in
succession
always
you
will
observe
for
some
sublime
motive
which
must
be
carefully
analysed
in
its
progress
i
have
as
amiable
a
pair
of
tragic
characters
as
ever
issued
from
that
new
region
of
the
belles
lettres
which
i
have
called
the
morbid
anatomy
of
black
bile
and
which
is
greatly
to
be
admired
and
rejoiced
at
as
affording
a
fine
scope
for
the
exhibition
of
mental
power
mr
hilary
which
is
about
as
well
employed
as
the
power
of
a
hothouse
would
be
in
forcing
up
a
nettle
to
the
size
of
an
elm
if
we
go
on
in
this
way
we
shall
have
a
new
art
of
poetry
of
which
one
of
the
first
rules
will
be
to
remember
to
forget
that
there
are
any
such
things
as
sunshine
and
music
in
the
world
the
honourable
mr
listless
it
seems
to
be
the
case
with
us
at
present
or
we
should
not
have
interrupted
miss
music
with
this
exceedingly
dry
conversation
mr
flosky
i
should
be
most
happy
if
miss
would
remind
us
that
there
are
yet
both
music
and
sunshine
the
honourable
mr
listless
in
the
voice
and
the
smile
of
beauty
may
i
entreat
the
favour
of
over
the
pages
of
all
were
silent
and
marionetta
sung
why
are
thy
looks
so
blank
grey
friar
why
are
thy
looks
so
blue
thou
more
pale
and
lank
grey
friar
than
thou
wast
used
to
do
say
what
has
made
thee
rue
thy
form
was
plump
and
a
light
did
shine
in
thy
round
and
ruby
face
which
showed
an
outward
visible
sign
of
an
inward
spiritual
grace
say
what
has
changed
thy
case
yet
will
i
tell
thee
true
grey
friar
i
very
well
can
see
that
if
thy
looks
are
blue
grey
friar
is
all
for

is
all
for

of
me
but
breathe
not
thy
vows
to
me
grey
friar
oh
breathe
them
not
i
pray
for
ill

in
a
reverend

win

be
more
of

lark
than

owl
scythrop
immediately
replaced
dante
on
the
shelf
and
joined
the
circle
round
the
beautiful
singer
marionetta
gave
him
a
smile
of
approbation
that
fully
restored
his
complacency
and
they
continued
on
the
best
possible
terms
during
the
remainder
of
the
evening
the
honourable
mr
listless
turned
over
the
leaves
with
double
alacrity
saying
are
severe
upon
invalids
miss
to
escape
your
satire
i
must
try
to
be
sprightly
though
the
exertion
is
too
much
for
me
chapter
vii
a
new
visitor
arrived
at
the
abbey
in
the
person
of
mr
asterias
the
ichthyologist
this
gentleman
had
passed
his
life
in
seeking
the
living
wonders
of
the
deep
through
the
four
quarters
of
the
world
he
had
a
cabinet
of
stuffed
and
dried
fishes
of
shells
corals
and
madrepores
that
was
the
admiration
and
envy
of
the
royal
society
he
had
penetrated
into
the
watery
den
of
the
sepia
octopus
disturbed
the
conjugal
happiness
of
that
of
the
ocean
and
come
off
victorious
in
a
sanguinary
conflict
he
had
been
becalmed
in
the
tropical
seas
and
had
watched
in
eager
expectation
though
unhappily
always
in
vain
to
see
the
colossal
polypus
rise
from
the
water
and
entwine
its
enormous
arms
round
the
masts
and
the
rigging
he
maintained
the
origin
of
all
things
from
water
and
insisted
that
the
polypodes
were
the
first
of
animated
things
and
that
from
their
round
bodies
and
arms
the
hindoos
had
taken
their
gods
the
most
ancient
of
deities
but
the
chief
object
of
his
ambition
the
end
and
aim
of
his
researches
was
to
discover
a
triton
and
a
mermaid
the
existence
of
which
he
most
potently
and
implicitly
believed
and
was
prepared
to
demonstrate
priori
à
posteriori
à
synthetically
and
analytically
syllogistically
and
inductively
by
arguments
deduced
both
from
acknowledged
facts
and
plausible
hypotheses
a
report
that
a
mermaid
had
been
seen
her
soft
alluring
locks
on
the
of
lincolnshire
had
brought
him
in
great
haste
from
london
to
pay
a
and
visit
to
his
old
acquaintance
mr
glowry
mr
asterias
was
accompanied
by
his
son
to
whom
he
had
given
the
name
of
aquarius
flattering
himself
that
he
would
in
the
process
of
time
become
a
constellation
among
the
stars
of
ichthyological
science
what
charitable
female
had
lent
him
the
mould
in
which
this
son
was
cast
no
one
pretended
to
know
and
as
he
never
dropped
the
most
distant
allusion
to
aquarius
mother
some
of
the
wags
of
london
maintained
that
he
had
received
the
favours
of
a
mermaid
and
that
the
scientific
perquisitions
which
kept
him
always
prowling
about
the
were
directed
by
the
less
philosophical
motive
of
regaining
his
lost
love
mr
asterias
perlustrated
the
for
several
days
and
reaped
disappointment
but
not
despair
one
night
shortly
after
his
arrival
he
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
windows
of
the
library
looking
towards
the
sea
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
figure
which
was
moving
near
the
edge
of
the
surf
and
which
was
dimly
visible
through
the
moonless
summer
night
its
motions
were
irregular
like
those
of
a
person
in
a
state
of
indecision
it
had
extremely
long
hair
which
floated
in
the
wind
whatever
else
it
might
be
it
certainly
was
not
a
fisherman
it
might
be
a
lady
but
it
was
neither
mrs
hilary
nor
miss
for
they
were
both
in
the
library
it
might
be
one
of
the
female
servants
but
it
had
too
much
grace
and
too
striking
an
air
of
habitual
liberty
to
render
it
probable
besides
what
should
one
of
the
female
servants
be
doing
there
at
this
hour
moving
to
and
fro
as
it
seemed
without
any
visible
purpose
it
could
scarcely
be
a
stranger
for
claydyke
the
nearest
village
was
ten
miles
distant
and
what
female
would
come
ten
miles
across
the
fens
for
no
purpose
but
to
hover
over
the
surf
under
the
walls
of
nightmare
abbey
might
it
not
be
a
mermaid
it
was
possibly
a
mermaid
it
was
probably
a
mermaid
it
was
very
probably
a
mermaid
nay
what
else
could
it
be
but
a
mermaid
it
certainly
was
a
mermaid
mr
asterias
stole
out
of
the
library
on
tiptoe
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
having
beckoned
aquarius
to
follow
him
the
rest
of
the
party
was
in
great
surprise
at
mr
asterias
movement
and
some
of
them
approached
the
window
to
see
if
the
locality
would
tend
to
elucidate
the
mystery
presently
they
saw
him
and
aquarius
cautiously
stealing
along
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
but
they
saw
nothing
more
and
mr
asterias
returning
told
them
with
accents
of
great
disappointment
that
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
a
mermaid
but
she
had
eluded
him
in
the
darkness
and
was
gone
he
presumed
to
sup
with
some
enamoured
triton
in
a
submarine
grotto
seriously
mr
asterias
said
the
honourable
mr
listless
you
positively
believe
there
are
such
things
as
mermaids
mr
asterias
most
assuredly
and
tritons
too
the
honourable
mr
listless
what
things
that
are
half
human
and
half
fish
mr
asterias
precisely
they
are
the
of
the
sea
but
i
am
persuaded
that
there
are
also
complete
sea
men
differing
in
no
respect
from
us
but
that
they
are
stupid
and
covered
with
scales
for
though
our
organisation
seems
to
exclude
us
essentially
from
the
class
of
amphibious
animals
yet
anatomists
well
know
that
the
may
remain
open
in
an
adult
and
that
respiration
is
in
that
case
not
necessary
to
life
and
how
can
it
be
otherwise
explained
that
the
indian
divers
employed
in
the
pearl
fishery
pass
whole
hours
under
the
water
and
that
the
famous
swedish
gardener
of
troningholm
lived
a
day
and
a
half
under
the
ice
without
being
drowned
a
nereid
or
mermaid
was
taken
in
the
year
in
a
dutch
lake
and
was
in
every
respect
like
a
french
woman
except
that
she
did
not
speak
towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
an
english
ship
a
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
from
land
in
the
greenland
seas
discovered
a
flotilla
of
sixty
or
seventy
little
skiffs
in
each
of
which
was
a
triton
or
sea
man
at
the
approach
of
the
english
vessel
the
whole
of
them
seized
with
simultaneous
fear
disappeared
skiffs
and
all
under
the
water
as
if
they
had
been
a
human
variety
of
the
nautilus
the
illustrious
don
feijoo
has
preserved
an
authentic
and
story
of
a
young
spaniard
named
francis
de
la
vega
who
bathing
with
some
of
his
friends
in
june
suddenly
dived
under
the
sea
and
rose
no
more
his
friends
thought
him
drowned
they
were
plebeians
and
pious
catholics
but
a
philosopher
might
very
legitimately
have
drawn
the
same
conclusion
the
reverend
mr
larynx
nothing
could
be
more
logical
mr
asterias
five
years
afterwards
some
fishermen
near
cadiz
found
in
their
nets
a
triton
or
sea
man
they
spoke
to
him
in
several
languages
the
reverend
mr
larynx
they
were
very
learned
fishermen
mr
hilary
they
had
the
gift
of
tongues
by
especial
favour
of
their
brother
fisherman
saint
peter
the
honourable
mr
listless
is
saint
peter
the
tutelar
saint
of
cadiz
of
the
company
could
answer
this
question
mr
asterias
they
spoke
to
him
in
several
languages
but
he
was
as
mute
as
a
fish
they
handed
him
over
to
some
holy
friars
who
exorcised
him
but
the
devil
was
mute
too
after
some
days
he
pronounced
the
name
lierganes
a
monk
took
him
to
that
village
his
mother
and
brothers
recognised
and
embraced
him
but
he
was
as
insensible
to
their
caresses
as
any
other
fish
would
have
been
he
had
some
scales
on
his
body
which
dropped
off
by
degrees
but
his
skin
was
as
hard
and
rough
as
shagreen
he
stayed
at
home
nine
years
without
recovering
his
speech
or
his
reason
he
then
disappeared
again
and
one
of
his
old
acquaintance
some
years
after
saw
him
pop
his
head
out
of
the
water
near
the
coast
of
the
asturias
these
facts
were
certified
by
his
brothers
and
by
don
gaspardo
de
la
riba
aguero
knight
of
saint
james
who
lived
near
lierganes
and
often
had
the
pleasure
of
our
triton
company
to
pliny
mentions
an
embassy
of
the
olyssiponians
to
tiberius
to
give
him
intelligence
of
a
triton
which
had
been
heard
playing
on
its
shell
in
a
certain
cave
with
several
other
authenticated
facts
on
the
subject
of
tritons
and
nereids
the

mr

i
am
overwhelmed
i
never
saw
the
rascal
in
such
a
condition
before
but
will
you
allow
me
mr
asterias
to
inquire
into
the
of
all
the
pains
and
expense
you
have
incurred
to
discover
a
mermaid
the
sir
is
the
question
i
always
take
the
liberty
to
ask
when
i
see
any
one
taking
much
trouble
for
any
object
i
am
myself
a
sort
of
signor
pococurante
and
should
like
to
know
if
there
be
any
thing
better
or
pleasanter
than
the
state
of
existing
and
doing
nothing
mr
asterias
i
have
made
many
voyages
mr
listless
to
remote
and
barren
shores
i
have
travelled
over
desert
and
inhospitable
lands
i
have
defied
danger
i
have
endured
fatigue
i
have
submitted
to
privation
in
the
midst
of
these
i
have
experienced
pleasures
which
i
would
not
at
any
time
have
exchanged
for
that
of
existing
and
doing
nothing
i
have
known
many
evils
but
i
have
never
known
the
worst
of
all
which
as
it
seems
to
me
are
those
which
are
comprehended
in
the
inexhaustible
varieties
of
spleen
chagrin
vapours
blue
devils
discontent
misanthropy
and
all
their
interminable
train
of
fretfulness
querulousness
suspicions
jealousies
and
fears
which
have
alike
infected
society
and
the
literature
of
society
and
which
would
make
an
arctic
ocean
of
the
human
mind
if
the
more
humane
pursuits
of
philosophy
and
science
did
not
keep
alive
the
better
feelings
and
more
valuable
energies
of
our
nature
the
honourable
mr
listless
you
are
pleased
to
be
severe
upon
our
fashionable
belles
lettres
mr
asterias
surely
not
without
reason
when
pirates
highwaymen
and
other
varieties
of
the
extensive
genus
marauder
are
the
only
of
the
active
as
splenetic
and
railing
misanthropy
is
of
the
speculative
energy
a
gloomy
brow
and
a
tragical
voice
seem
to
have
been
of
late
the
characteristics
of
fashionable
manners
and
a
morbid
withering
deadly
antisocial
sirocco
loaded
with
moral
and
political
despair
breathes
through
all
the
groves
and
valleys
of
the
modern
parnassus
while
science
moves
on
in
the
calm
dignity
of
its
course
affording
to
youth
delights
equally
pure
and
vivid
to
maturity
calm
and
grateful
occupation
to
old
age
the
most
pleasing
recollections
and
inexhaustible
materials
of
agreeable
and
salutary
reflection
and
while
its
votary
enjoys
the
disinterested
pleasure
of
enlarging
the
intellect
and
increasing
the
comforts
of
society
he
is
himself
independent
of
the
caprices
of
human
intercourse
and
the
accidents
of
human
fortune
nature
is
his
great
and
inexhaustible
treasure
his
days
are
always
too
short
for
his
enjoyment
is
a
stranger
to
his
door
at
peace
with
the
world
and
with
his
own
mind
he
suffices
to
himself
makes
all
around
him
happy
and
the
close
of
his
pleasing
and
beneficial
existence
is
the
evening
of
a
beautiful
day
the
honourable
mr
listless
really
i
should
like
very
well
to
lead
such
a
life
myself
but
the
exertion
would
be
too
much
for
me
besides
i
have
been
at
college
i
contrive
to
get
through
my
day
by
sinking
the
morning
in
bed
and
killing
the
evening
in
company
dressing
and
dining
in
the
intermediate
space
and
stopping
the
chinks
and
crevices
of
the
few
vacant
moments
that
remain
with
a
little
easy
reading
and
that
amiable
discontent
and
antisociality
which
you
reprobate
in
our
present
literature
i
find
i
do
assure
you
a
very
fine
mental
tonic
which
reconciles
me
to
my
favourite
pursuit
of
doing
nothing
by
showing
me
that
nobody
is
worth
doing
any
thing
for
marionetta
but
is
there
not
in
such
compositions
a
kind
of
unconscious
which
seems
to
carry
their
own
antidote
with
them
for
surely
no
one
who
cordially
and
truly
either
hates
or
despises
the
world
will
publish
a
volume
every
three
months
to
say
so
mr
flosky
there
is
a
secret
in
all
this
which
i
will
elucidate
with
a
dusky
remark
according
to
berkeley
the
of
things
is
they
exist
as
they
are
perceived
but
leaving
for
the
present
as
far
as
relates
to
the
material
world
the
materialists
hyloists
and
antihyloists
to
settle
this
point
among
them
which
is
indeed
a
subtle
question
raised
among
those
out
o
their
wits
and
those
i
the
wrong
for
only
we
transcendentalists
are
in
the
right
we
may
very
safely
assert
that
the
of
happiness
is
it
exists
as
it
is
perceived
is
the
mind
that
maketh
well
or
the
elements
of
pleasure
and
pain
are
every
where
the
degree
of
happiness
that
any
circumstances
or
objects
can
confer
on
us
depends
on
the
mental
disposition
with
which
we
approach
them
if
you
consider
what
is
meant
by
the
common
phrases
a
happy
disposition
and
a
discontented
temper
you
will
perceive
that
the
truth
for
which
i
am
contending
is
universally
admitted
mr
flosky
suddenly
stopped
he
found
himself
unintentionally
trespassing
within
the
limits
of
common
sense
mr
hilary
it
is
very
true
a
happy
disposition
finds
materials
of
enjoyment
every
where
in
the
city
or
the
country
in
society
or
in
solitude
in
the
theatre
or
the
forest
in
the
hum
of
the
multitude
or
in
the
silence
of
the
mountains
are
alike
materials
of
reflection
and
elements
of
pleasure
it
is
one
mode
of
pleasure
to
listen
to
the
music
of
giovanni
in
a
theatre
glittering
with
light
and
crowded
with
elegance
and
beauty
it
is
another
to
glide
at
sunset
over
the
bosom
of
a
lonely
lake
where
no
sound
disturbs
the
silence
but
the
motion
of
the
boat
through
the
waters
a
happy
disposition
derives
pleasure
from
both
a
discontented
temper
from
neither
but
is
always
busy
in
detecting
deficiencies
and
feeding
dissatisfaction
with
comparisons
the
one
gathers
all
the
flowers
the
other
all
the
nettles
in
its
path
the
one
has
the
faculty
of
enjoying
every
thing
the
other
of
enjoying
nothing
the
one
realises
all
the
pleasure
of
the
present
good
the
other
converts
it
into
pain
by
pining
after
something
better
which
is
only
better
because
it
is
not
present
and
which
if
it
were
present
would
not
be
enjoyed
these
morbid
spirits
are
in
life
what
professed
critics
are
in
literature
they
see
nothing
but
faults
because
they
are
predetermined
to
shut
their
eyes
to
beauties
the
critic
does
his
utmost
to
blight
genius
in
its
infancy
that
which
rises
in
spite
of
him
he
will
not
see
and
then
he
complains
of
the
decline
of
literature
in
like
manner
these
cankers
of
society
complain
of
human
nature
and
society
when
they
have
wilfully
debarred
themselves
from
all
the
good
they
contain
and
done
their
utmost
to
blight
their
own
happiness
and
that
of
all
around
them
misanthropy
is
sometimes
the
product
of
disappointed
benevolence
but
it
is
more
frequently
the
offspring
of
overweening
and
mortified
vanity
quarrelling
with
the
world
for
not
being
better
treated
than
it
deserves
scythrop
these
remarks
are
rather
uncharitable
there
is
great
good
in
human
nature
but
it
is
at
present
ardent
spirits
can
not
but
be
dissatisfied
with
things
as
they
are
and
according
to
their
views
of
the
probabilities
of
amelioration
they
will
rush
into
the
extremes
of
either
hope
or
despair
of
which
the
first
is
enthusiasm
and
the
second
misanthropy
but
their
sources
in
this
case
are
the
same
as
the
severn
and
the
wye
run
in
different
directions
and
both
rise
in
plinlimmon
marionetta
there
is
salmon
in
both
for
the
resemblance
is
about
as
close
as
that
between
macedon
and
monmouth
chapter
viii
marionetta
observed
the
next
day
a
remarkable
perturbation
in
scythrop
for
which
she
could
not
imagine
any
probable
cause
she
was
willing
to
believe
at
first
that
it
had
some
transient
and
trifling
source
and
would
pass
off
in
a
day
or
two
but
contrary
to
this
expectation
it
daily
increased
she
was
well
aware
that
scythrop
had
a
strong
tendency
to
the
love
of
mystery
for
its
own
sake
that
is
to
say
he
would
employ
mystery
to
serve
a
purpose
but
would
first
choose
his
purpose
by
its
capability
of
mystery
he
seemed
now
to
have
more
mystery
on
his
hands
than
the
laws
of
the
system
allowed
and
to
wear
his
coat
of
darkness
with
an
air
of
great
discomfort
all
her
little
playful
arts
lost
by
degrees
much
of
their
power
either
to
irritate
or
to
soothe
and
the
first
perception
of
her
diminished
influence
produced
in
her
an
immediate
depression
of
spirits
and
a
consequent
sadness
of
demeanour
that
rendered
her
very
interesting
to
mr
glowry
who
duly
considering
the
improbability
of
accomplishing
his
wishes
with
respect
to
miss
toobad
which
improbability
naturally
increased
in
the
diurnal
ratio
of
that
young
lady
absence
began
to
reconcile
himself
by
degrees
to
the
idea
of
marionetta
being
his
daughter
marionetta
made
many
ineffectual
attempts
to
extract
from
scythrop
the
secret
of
his
mystery
and
in
despair
of
drawing
it
from
himself
began
to
form
hopes
that
she
might
find
a
clue
to
it
from
mr
flosky
who
was
scythrop
dearest
friend
and
was
more
frequently
than
any
other
person
admitted
to
his
solitary
tower
mr
flosky
however
had
ceased
to
be
visible
in
a
morning
he
was
engaged
in
the
composition
of
a
dismal
ballad
and
marionetta
uneasiness
overcoming
her
scruples
of
decorum
she
determined
to
seek
him
in
the
apartment
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
study
she
tapped
at
the
door
and
at
the
sound
in
entered
the
apartment
it
was
noon
and
the
sun
was
shining
in
full
splendour
much
to
the
annoyance
of
mr
flosky
who
had
obviated
the
inconvenience
by
closing
the
shutters
and
drawing
the
he
was
sitting
at
his
table
by
the
light
of
a
solitary
candle
with
a
pen
in
one
hand
and
a
muffineer
in
the
other
with
which
he
occasionally
sprinkled
salt
on
the
wick
to
make
it
burn
blue
he
sat
with
eye
in
a
fine
frenzy
rolling
and
turned
his
inspired
gaze
on
marionetta
as
if
she
had
been
the
ghastly
ladie
of
a
magical
vision
then
placed
his
hand
before
his
eyes
with
an
appearance
of
manifest
pain
shook
his
head
withdrew
his
hand
rubbed
his
eyes
like
a
waking
man
and
said
in
a
tone
of
ruefulness
most
jeremitaylorically
pathetic
what
am
i
to
attribute
this
very
unexpected
pleasure
my
dear
miss
marionetta
i
must
apologise
for
intruding
on
you
mr
flosky
but
the
interest
which
i
you
take
in
my
cousin
scythrop
mr
flosky
pardon
me
miss
i
do
not
take
any
interest
in
any
person
or
thing
on
the
face
of
the
earth
which
sentiment
if
you
analyse
it
you
will
find
to
be
the
quintessence
of
the
most
refined
philanthropy
marionetta
i
will
take
it
for
granted
that
it
is
so
mr
flosky
i
am
not
conversant
with
metaphysical
subtleties
but
mr
flosky
subtleties
my
dear
miss
i
am
sorry
to
find
you
participating
in
the
vulgar
error
of
the
public
to
whom
an
unusual
collocation
of
words
involving
a
juxtaposition
of
antiperistatical
ideas
immediately
suggests
the
notion
of
hyperoxysophistical
paradoxology
marionetta
indeed
mr
flosky
it
suggests
no
such
notion
to
me
i
have
sought
you
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
information
mr
flosky
shaking
his
head
no
one
ever
sought
me
for
such
a
purpose
before
marionetta
i
think
mr
flosky
that
is
i
believe
that
is
i
fancy
that
is
i
imagine
mr
flosky
the
greek
toytesti
the
the
the
à
the
my
dear
miss
is
not
applicable
in
this
case
if
you
will
permit
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
saying
so
think
is
not
synonymous
with
believe
for
belief
in
many
most
important
particulars
results
from
the
total
absence
the
absolute
negation
of
thought
and
is
thereby
the
sane
and
orthodox
condition
of
mind
and
thought
and
belief
are
both
essentially
different
from
fancy
and
fancy
again
is
distinct
from
imagination
this
distinction
between
fancy
and
imagination
is
one
of
the
most
abstruse
and
important
points
of
metaphysics
i
have
written
seven
hundred
pages
of
promise
to
elucidate
it
which
promise
i
shall
keep
as
faithfully
as
the
bank
will
its
promise
to
pay
marionetta
i
assure
you
mr
flosky
i
care
no
more
about
metaphysics
than
i
do
about
the
bank
and
if
you
will
condescend
to
talk
to
a
simple
girl
in
intelligible
terms
mr
flosky
say
not
condescend
know
you
not
that
you
talk
to
the
most
humble
of
men
to
one
who
has
buckled
on
the
armour
of
sanctity
and
clothed
himself
with
humility
as
with
a
garment
marionetta
my
cousin
scythrop
has
of
late
had
an
air
of
mystery
about
him
which
gives
me
great
uneasiness
mr
flosky
that
is
strange
nothing
is
so
becoming
to
a
man
as
an
air
of
mystery
mystery
is
the
very
of
all
that
is
beautiful
in
poetry
all
that
is
sacred
in
faith
and
all
that
is
recondite
in
transcendental
psychology
i
am
writing
a
ballad
which
is
all
mystery
it
is
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
of
and
is
indeed
stuff
made
of
a
dream
for
last
night
i
fell
asleep
as
usual
over
my
book
and
had
a
vision
of
pure
reason
i
composed
five
hundred
lines
in
my
sleep
so
that
having
had
a
dream
of
a
ballad
i
am
now
officiating
as
my
own
peter
quince
and
making
a
ballad
of
my
dream
and
it
shall
be
called
bottom
dream
because
it
has
no
bottom
marionetta
i
see
mr
flosky
you
think
my
intrusion
unseasonable
and
are
inclined
to
punish
it
by
talking
nonsense
to
me
flosky
gave
a
start
at
the
word
nonsense
which
almost
overturned
the
i
assure
you
i
would
not
have
intruded
if
i
had
not
been
very
much
interested
in
the
question
i
wish
to
ask
flosky
listened
in
sullen
my
cousin
scythrop
seems
to
have
some
secret
preying
on
his
flosky
was
he
seems
very
unhappy
mr
perhaps
you
are
acquainted
with
the
flosky
was
still
i
only
wish
to
know
mr
flosky
if
it
is
any
thing
that
could
be
remedied
by
any
thing
that
any
one
of
whom
i
know
any
thing
could
do
mr
flosky
a
there
are
various
ways
of
getting
at
secrets
the
most
approved
methods
as
recommended
both
theoretically
and
practically
in
philosophical
novels
are
eavesdropping
at
picking
the
locks
of
chests
and
desks
peeping
into
letters
steaming
wafers
and
insinuating
hot
wire
under
sealing
wax
none
of
which
methods
i
hold
it
lawful
to
practise
marionetta
surely
mr
flosky
you
can
not
suspect
me
of
wishing
to
adopt
or
encourage
such
base
and
contemptible
arts
mr
flosky
yet
are
they
recommended
and
with
reasons
by
writers
of
gravity
and
note
as
simple
and
easy
methods
of
studying
character
and
gratifying
that
laudable
curiosity
which
aims
at
the
knowledge
of
man
marionetta
i
am
as
ignorant
of
this
morality
which
you
do
not
approve
as
of
the
metaphysics
which
you
do
i
should
be
glad
to
know
by
your
means
what
is
the
matter
with
my
cousin
i
do
not
like
to
see
him
unhappy
and
i
suppose
there
is
some
reason
for
it
mr
flosky
now
i
should
rather
suppose
there
is
no
reason
for
it
it
is
the
fashion
to
be
unhappy
to
have
a
reason
for
being
so
would
be
exceedingly
to
be
so
without
any
is
the
province
of
genius
the
art
of
being
miserable
for
misery
sake
has
been
brought
to
great
perfection
in
our
days
and
the
ancient
odyssey
which
held
forth
a
shining
example
of
the
endurance
of
real
misfortune
will
give
place
to
a
modern
one
setting
out
a
more
instructive
picture
of
querulous
impatience
under
imaginary
evils
marionetta
will
you
oblige
me
mr
flosky
by
giving
me
a
plain
answer
to
a
plain
question
mr
flosky
it
is
impossible
my
dear
miss
i
never
gave
a
plain
answer
to
a
question
in
my
life
marionetta
do
you
or
do
you
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
my
cousin
mr
flosky
to
say
that
i
do
not
know
would
be
to
say
that
i
am
ignorant
of
something
and
god
forbid
that
a
transcendental
metaphysician
who
has
pure
anticipated
cognitions
of
every
thing
and
carries
the
whole
science
of
geometry
in
his
head
without
ever
having
looked
into
euclid
should
fall
into
so
empirical
an
error
as
to
declare
himself
ignorant
of
any
thing
to
say
that
i
do
know
would
be
to
pretend
to
positive
and
circumstantial
knowledge
touching
present
matter
of
fact
which
when
you
consider
the
nature
of
evidence
and
the
various
lights
in
which
the
same
thing
may
be
seen
marionetta
i
see
mr
flosky
that
either
you
have
no
information
or
are
determined
not
to
impart
it
and
i
beg
your
pardon
for
having
given
you
this
unnecessary
trouble
mr
flosky
my
dear
miss
it
would
have
given
me
great
pleasure
to
have
said
any
thing
that
would
have
given
you
pleasure
but
if
any
person
living
could
make
report
of
having
obtained
any
information
on
any
subject
from
ferdinando
flosky
my
transcendental
reputation
would
be
ruined
for
ever
chapter
ix
scythrop
grew
every
day
more
reserved
mysterious
and
distrait
and
gradually
lengthened
the
duration
of
his
diurnal
seclusions
in
his
tower
marionetta
thought
she
perceived
in
all
this
very
manifest
symptoms
of
a
warm
love
cooling
it
was
seldom
that
she
found
herself
alone
with
him
in
the
morning
and
on
these
occasions
if
she
was
silent
in
the
hope
of
his
speaking
first
not
a
syllable
would
he
utter
if
she
spoke
to
him
indirectly
he
assented
monosyllabically
if
she
questioned
him
his
answers
were
brief
constrained
and
evasive
still
though
her
spirits
were
depressed
her
playfulness
had
not
so
totally
forsaken
her
but
that
it
illuminated
at
intervals
the
gloom
of
nightmare
abbey
and
if
on
any
occasion
she
observed
in
scythrop
tokens
of
unextinguished
or
returning
passion
her
love
of
tormenting
her
lover
immediately
got
the
better
both
of
her
grief
and
her
sympathy
though
not
of
her
curiosity
which
scythrop
seemed
determined
not
to
satisfy
this
playfulness
however
was
in
a
great
measure
artificial
and
usually
vanished
with
the
irritable
strephon
to
whose
annoyance
it
had
been
exerted
the
genius
loci
the
of
nightmare
abbey
the
spirit
of
black
melancholy
began
to
set
his
seal
on
her
pallescent
countenance
scythrop
perceived
the
change
found
his
tender
sympathies
awakened
and
did
his
utmost
to
comfort
the
afflicted
damsel
assuring
her
that
his
seeming
inattention
had
only
proceeded
from
his
being
involved
in
a
profound
meditation
on
a
very
hopeful
scheme
for
the
regeneration
of
human
society
marionetta
called
him
ungrateful
cruel
and
accompanied
her
reproaches
with
many
sobs
and
tears
poor
scythrop
growing
every
moment
more
soft
and
submissive
till
at
length
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
and
declared
that
no
competition
of
beauty
however
dazzling
genius
however
transcendent
talents
however
cultivated
or
philosophy
however
enlightened
should
ever
make
him
renounce
his
divine
marionetta
thought
marionetta
and
suddenly
with
an
air
of
the
most
freezing
indifference
she
said
are
perfectly
at
liberty
sir
to
do
as
you
please
i
beg
you
will
follow
your
own
plans
without
any
reference
to
me
scythrop
was
confounded
what
was
become
of
all
her
passion
and
her
tears
still
kneeling
he
kissed
her
hand
with
rueful
timidity
and
said
in
most
pathetic
accents
you
not
love
me
marionetta
said
marionetta
with
a
look
of
cold
composure
scythrop
still
looked
up
incredulously
i
tell
you
very
well
madam
said
scythrop
rising
that
is
the
case
there
are
those
in
the
world
be
sure
there
are
sir
and
do
you
suppose
i
do
not
see
through
your
designs
you
ungenerous
monster
designs
marionetta
your
designs
scythrop
you
have
come
here
to
cast
me
off
and
artfully
contrive
that
it
should
appear
to
be
my
doing
and
not
yours
thinking
to
quiet
your
tender
conscience
with
this
pitiful
stratagem
but
do
not
suppose
that
you
are
of
so
much
consequence
to
me
do
not
suppose
it
you
are
of
no
consequence
to
me
at
all
none
at
all
therefore
leave
me
i
renounce
you
leave
me
why
do
you
not
leave
me
scythrop
endeavoured
to
remonstrate
but
without
success
she
reiterated
her
injunctions
to
him
to
leave
her
till
in
the
simplicity
of
his
spirit
he
was
preparing
to
comply
when
he
had
nearly
reached
the
door
marionetta
said
scythrop
looked
back
scythrop
she
repeated
will
never
see
me
again
see
you
again
marionetta
shall
go
from
hence
perhaps
and
before
we
meet
again
one
of
us
will
be
married
and
we
might
as
well
be
dead
you
know
scythrop
the
sudden
change
of
her
voice
in
the
last
few
words
and
the
burst
of
tears
that
accompanied
them
acted
like
electricity
on
the
youth
and
in
another
instant
a
complete
reconciliation
was
accomplished
without
the
intervention
of
words
there
are
indeed
some
learned
casuists
who
maintain
that
love
has
no
language
and
that
all
the
misunderstandings
and
dissensions
of
lovers
arise
from
the
fatal
habit
of
employing
words
on
a
subject
to
which
words
are
inapplicable
that
love
beginning
with
looks
that
is
to
say
with
the
physiognomical
expression
of
congenial
mental
dispositions
tends
through
a
regular
gradation
of
signs
and
symbols
of
affection
to
that
consummation
which
is
most
devoutly
to
be
wished
and
that
it
neither
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
nor
probable
that
there
would
be
a
single
word
spoken
from
first
to
last
between
two
sympathetic
spirits
were
it
not
that
the
arbitrary
institutions
of
society
have
raised
at
every
step
of
this
very
simple
process
so
many
complicated
impediments
and
barriers
in
the
shape
of
settlements
and
ceremonies
parents
and
guardians
lawyers
and
parsons
that
many
an
adventurous
knight
who
in
order
to
obtain
the
conquest
of
the
hesperian
fruit
is
obliged
to
fight
his
way
through
all
these
monsters
is
either
repulsed
at
the
onset
or
vanquished
before
the
achievement
of
his
enterprise
and
such
a
quantity
of
unnatural
talking
is
rendered
inevitably
necessary
through
all
the
stages
of
the
progression
that
the
tender
and
volatile
spirit
of
love
often
takes
flight
on
the
pinions
of
some
of
the
greek
epea
pteroenta
or
which
are
pressed
into
his
service
in
despite
of
himself
at
this
conjuncture
mr
glowry
entered
and
sitting
down
near
them
said
see
how
it
is
and
as
we
are
all
sure
to
be
miserable
do
what
we
may
there
is
no
need
of
taking
pains
to
make
one
another
more
so
therefore
with
god
blessing
and
mine
there
joining
their
hands
as
he
spoke
scythrop
was
not
exactly
prepared
for
this
decisive
step
but
he
could
only
stammer
out
sir
you
are
too
good
and
mr
glowry
departed
to
bring
mr
hilary
to
ratify
the
act
now
whatever
truth
there
may
be
in
the
theory
of
love
and
language
of
which
we
have
so
recently
spoken
certain
it
is
that
during
mr
glowry
absence
which
lasted
half
an
hour
not
a
single
word
was
said
by
either
scythrop
or
marionetta
mr
glowry
returned
with
mr
hilary
who
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
so
advantageous
an
establishment
for
his
orphan
niece
of
whom
he
considered
himself
in
some
manner
the
guardian
and
nothing
remained
as
mr
glowry
observed
but
to
fix
the
day
marionetta
blushed
and
was
silent
scythrop
was
also
silent
for
a
time
and
at
length
hesitatingly
said
dear
sir
your
goodness
overpowers
me
but
really
you
are
so
precipitate
now
this
remark
if
the
young
lady
had
made
it
would
whether
she
thought
it
or
not
for
sincerity
is
a
thing
of
no
account
on
these
occasions
nor
indeed
on
any
other
according
to
mr
flosky
this
remark
if
the
young
lady
had
made
it
would
have
been
perfectly
il
but
being
made
by
the
young
gentleman
it
was
autre
and
was
indeed
in
the
eyes
of
his
mistress
a
most
heinous
and
irremissible
offence
marionetta
was
angry
very
angry
but
she
concealed
her
anger
and
said
calmly
and
coldly
you
are
much
too
precipitate
mr
glowry
i
assure
you
sir
i
have
by
no
means
made
up
my
mind
and
indeed
as
far
as
i
know
it
it
inclines
the
other
way
but
it
will
be
quite
time
enough
to
think
of
these
matters
seven
years
hence
before
surprise
permitted
reply
the
young
lady
had
locked
herself
up
in
her
own
apartment
scythrop
said
mr
glowry
elongating
his
face
exceedingly
devil
is
come
among
us
sure
enough
as
mr
toobad
observes
i
thought
you
and
marionetta
were
both
of
a
mind
we
are
i
believe
sir
said
scythrop
gloomily
and
stalked
away
to
his
tower
glowry
said
mr
hilary
do
not
very
well
understand
all
this
brother
hilary
said
mr
glowry
little
foolish
love
quarrel
nothing
more
whims
freaks
april
showers
they
will
be
blown
over
by
not
said
mr
hilary
april
showers
have
made
us
april
fools
said
mr
glowry
are
a
happy
man
and
in
all
your
afflictions
you
can
console
yourself
with
a
joke
let
it
be
ever
so
bad
provided
you
crack
it
yourself
i
should
be
very
happy
to
laugh
with
you
if
it
would
give
you
any
satisfaction
but
really
at
present
my
heart
is
so
sad
that
i
find
it
impossible
to
levy
a
contribution
on
my
muscles
chapter

on
the
evening
on
which
mr
asterias
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
female
figure
on
the
which
he
had
translated
into
the
visual
sign
of
his
interior
cognition
of
a
mermaid
scythrop
retiring
to
his
tower
found
his
study
preoccupied
a
stranger
muffled
in
a
cloak
was
sitting
at
his
table
scythrop
paused
in
surprise
the
stranger
rose
at
his
entrance
and
looked
at
him
intently
a
few
minutes
in
silence
the
eyes
of
the
stranger
alone
were
visible
all
the
rest
of
the
figure
was
muffled
and
mantled
in
the
folds
of
a
black
cloak
which
was
raised
by
the
right
hand
to
the
level
of
the
eyes
this
scrutiny
being
completed
the
stranger
dropping
the
cloak
said
see
by
your
physiognomy
that
you
may
be
trusted
and
revealed
to
the
astonished
scythrop
a
female
form
and
countenance
of
dazzling
grace
and
beauty
with
long
flowing
hair
of
raven
blackness
and
large
black
eyes
of
almost
oppressive
brilliancy
which
strikingly
contrasted
with
a
complexion
of
snowy
whiteness
her
dress
was
extremely
elegant
but
had
an
appearance
of
foreign
fashion
as
if
both
the
lady
and
her
were
of
far
countree
guess
was
frightful
there
to
see
a
lady
so
richly
clad
as
she
beautiful
exceedingly
for
if
it
be
terrible
to
one
young
lady
to
find
another
under
a
tree
at
midnight
it
must
be
much
more
terrible
to
a
young
gentleman
to
find
a
young
lady
in
his
study
at
that
hour
if
the
logical
consecutiveness
of
this
conclusion
be
not
manifest
to
my
readers
i
am
sorry
for
their
dulness
and
must
refer
them
for
more
ample
elucidation
to
a
treatise
which
mr
flosky
intends
to
write
on
the
categories
of
relation
which
comprehend
substance
and
accident
cause
and
effect
action
and
scythrop
therefore
either
was
or
ought
to
have
been
frightened
at
all
events
he
was
astonished
and
astonishment
though
not
in
itself
fear
is
nevertheless
a
good
stage
towards
it
and
is
indeed
as
it
were
the
house
between
respect
and
terror
according
to
mr
burke
graduated
scale
of
the
sublime
are
surprised
said
the
lady
why
should
you
be
surprised
if
you
had
met
me
in
a
and
i
had
been
introduced
to
you
by
an
old
woman
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
course
can
the
division
of
two
or
three
walls
and
the
absence
of
an
unimportant
personage
make
the
same
object
essentially
different
in
the
perception
of
a
philosopher
not
said
scythrop
when
any
class
of
objects
has
habitually
presented
itself
to
our
perceptions
in
invariable
conjunction
with
particular
relations
then
on
the
sudden
appearance
of
one
object
of
the
class
divested
of
those
accompaniments
the
essential
difference
of
the
relation
is
by
an
involuntary
process
transferred
to
the
object
itself
which
thus
offers
itself
to
our
perceptions
with
all
the
strangeness
of
novelty
are
a
philosopher
said
the
lady
a
lover
of
liberty
you
are
the
author
of
a
treatise
called
philosophical
gas
or
a
project
for
a
general
illumination
of
the
human
mind
am
said
scythrop
delighted
at
this
first
blossom
of
his
renown
am
a
stranger
in
this
country
said
the
lady
have
been
but
a
few
days
in
it
yet
i
find
myself
immediately
under
the
necessity
of
seeking
refuge
from
an
atrocious
persecution
i
had
no
friend
to
whom
i
could
apply
and
in
the
midst
of
my
difficulties
accident
threw
your
pamphlet
in
my
way
i
saw
that
i
had
at
least
one
kindred
mind
in
this
nation
and
determined
to
apply
to
you
what
would
you
have
me
do
said
scythrop
more
and
more
amazed
and
not
a
little
perplexed
would
have
you
said
the
young
lady
me
in
finding
some
place
of
retreat
where
i
can
remain
concealed
from
the
indefatigable
search
that
is
being
made
for
me
i
have
been
so
nearly
caught
once
or
twice
already
that
i
can
not
confide
any
longer
in
my
own
ingenuity
doubtless
thought
scythrop
this
is
one
of
my
golden
have
constructed
said
he
this
tower
an
entrance
to
a
small
suite
of
unknown
apartments
in
the
main
building
which
i
defy
any
creature
living
to
detect
if
you
would
like
to
remain
there
a
day
or
two
till
i
can
find
you
a
more
suitable
concealment
you
may
rely
on
the
honour
of
a
transcendental
eleutherarch
rely
on
myself
said
the
lady
act
as
i
please
go
where
i
please
and
let
the
world
say
what
it
will
i
am
rich
enough
to
set
it
at
defiance
it
is
the
tyrant
of
the
poor
and
the
feeble
but
the
slave
of
those
who
are
above
the
reach
of
its
injury
scythrop
ventured
to
inquire
the
name
of
his
fair
is
a
name
said
the
lady
name
will
serve
the
purpose
of
distinction
call
me
stella
i
see
by
your
looks
she
added
you
think
all
this
very
strange
when
you
know
me
better
your
surprise
will
cease
i
submit
not
to
be
an
accomplice
in
my
slavery
i
am
like
yourself
a
lover
of
freedom
and
i
carry
my
theory
into
practice
alone
are
subject
to
blind
authority
who
have
no
reliance
on
their
own
stella
took
possession
of
the
recondite
apartments
scythrop
intended
to
find
her
another
asylum
but
from
day
to
day
he
postponed
his
intention
and
by
degrees
forgot
it
the
young
lady
reminded
him
of
it
from
day
to
day
till
she
also
forgot
it
scythrop
was
anxious
to
learn
her
history
but
she
would
add
nothing
to
what
she
had
already
communicated
that
she
was
shunning
an
atrocious
persecution
scythrop
thought
of
lord
and
the
alien
act
and
said
you
will
not
tell
your
name
i
suppose
it
is
in
the
green
bag
stella
not
understanding
what
he
meant
was
silent
and
scythrop
translating
silence
into
acquiescence
concluded
that
he
was
sheltering
an
whom
lord
suspected
of
an
intention
to
take
the
tower
and
set
fire
to
the
bank
exploits
at
least
as
likely
to
be
accomplished
by
the
hands
and
eyes
of
a
young
beauty
as
by
a
drunken
cobbler
and
doctor
armed
with
a
pamphlet
and
an
old
stocking
stella
in
her
conversations
with
scythrop
displayed
a
highly
cultivated
and
energetic
mind
full
of
impassioned
schemes
of
liberty
and
impatience
of
masculine
usurpation
she
had
a
lively
sense
of
all
the
oppressions
that
are
done
under
the
sun
and
the
vivid
pictures
which
her
imagination
presented
to
her
of
the
numberless
scenes
of
injustice
and
misery
which
are
being
acted
at
every
moment
in
every
part
of
the
inhabited
world
gave
an
habitual
seriousness
to
her
physiognomy
that
made
it
seem
as
if
a
smile
had
never
once
hovered
on
her
lips
she
was
intimately
conversant
with
the
german
language
and
literature
and
scythrop
listened
with
delight
to
her
repetitions
of
her
favourite
passages
from
schiller
and
goethe
and
to
her
encomiums
on
the
sublime
spartacus
weishaupt
the
immortal
founder
of
the
sect
of
the
illuminati
scythrop
found
that
his
soul
had
a
greater
capacity
of
love
than
the
image
of
marionetta
had
filled
the
form
of
stella
took
possession
of
every
vacant
corner
of
the
cavity
and
by
degrees
displaced
that
of
marionetta
from
many
of
the
outworks
of
the
citadel
though
the
latter
still
held
possession
of
the
he
judged
from
his
new
friend
calling
herself
stella
that
if
it
were
not
her
real
name
she
was
an
admirer
of
the
principles
of
the
german
play
from
which
she
had
taken
it
and
took
an
opportunity
of
leading
the
conversation
to
that
subject
but
to
his
great
surprise
the
lady
spoke
very
ardently
of
the
singleness
and
exclusiveness
of
love
and
declared
that
the
reign
of
affection
was
one
and
indivisible
that
it
might
be
transferred
but
could
not
be
participated
i
ever
love
said
she
shall
do
so
without
limit
or
restriction
i
shall
hold
all
difficulties
light
all
sacrifices
cheap
all
obstacles
gossamer
but
for
love
so
total
i
shall
claim
a
return
as
absolute
i
will
have
no
rival
whether
more
or
less
favoured
will
be
of
little
moment
i
will
be
neither
first
nor
second
i
will
be
alone
the
heart
which
i
shall
possess
i
will
possess
entirely
or
entirely
renounce
scythrop
did
not
dare
to
mention
the
name
of
marionetta
he
trembled
lest
some
unlucky
accident
should
reveal
it
to
stella
though
he
scarcely
knew
what
result
to
wish
or
anticipate
and
lived
in
the
double
fever
of
a
perpetual
dilemma
he
could
not
dissemble
to
himself
that
he
was
in
love
at
the
same
time
with
two
damsels
of
minds
and
habits
as
remote
as
the
antipodes
the
scale
of
predilection
always
inclined
to
the
fair
one
who
happened
to
be
present
but
the
absent
was
never
effectually
outweighed
though
the
degrees
of
exaltation
and
depression
varied
according
to
accidental
variations
in
the
outward
and
visible
signs
of
the
inward
and
spiritual
graces
of
his
respective
charmers
passing
and
repassing
several
times
a
day
from
the
company
of
the
one
to
that
of
the
other
he
was
like
a
shuttlecock
between
two
battledores
changing
its
direction
as
rapidly
as
the
oscillations
of
a
pendulum
receiving
many
a
hard
knock
on
the
cork
of
a
sensitive
heart
and
flying
from
point
to
point
on
the
feathers
of
a
head
this
was
an
awful
state
of
things
he
had
now
as
much
mystery
about
him
as
any
romantic
transcendentalist
or
transcendental
romancer
could
desire
he
had
his
esoterical
and
his
exoterical
love
he
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
losing
either
of
them
but
he
trembled
when
he
imagined
the
possibility
that
some
fatal
discovery
might
deprive
him
of
both
the
old
proverb
concerning
two
strings
to
a
bow
gave
him
some
gleams
of
comfort
but
that
concerning
two
stools
occurred
to
him
more
frequently
and
covered
his
forehead
with
a
cold
perspiration
with
stella
he
could
indulge
freely
in
all
his
romantic
and
philosophical
visions
he
could
build
castles
in
the
air
and
she
would
pile
towers
and
turrets
on
the
imaginary
edifices
with
marionetta
it
was
otherwise
she
knew
nothing
of
the
world
and
society
beyond
the
sphere
of
her
own
experience
her
life
was
all
music
and
sunshine
and
she
wondered
what
any
one
could
see
to
complain
of
in
such
a
pleasant
state
of
things
she
loved
scythrop
she
hardly
knew
why
indeed
she
was
not
always
sure
that
she
loved
him
at
all
she
felt
her
fondness
increase
or
diminish
in
an
inverse
ratio
to
his
when
she
had
manoeuvred
him
into
a
fever
of
passionate
love
she
often
felt
and
always
assumed
indifference
if
she
found
that
her
coldness
was
contagious
and
that
scythrop
either
was
or
pretended
to
be
as
indifferent
as
herself
she
would
become
doubly
kind
and
raise
him
again
to
that
elevation
from
which
she
had
previously
thrown
him
down
thus
when
his
love
was
flowing
hers
was
ebbing
when
his
was
ebbing
hers
was
flowing
now
and
then
there
were
moments
of
level
tide
when
reciprocal
affection
seemed
to
promise
imperturbable
harmony
but
scythrop
could
scarcely
resign
his
spirit
to
the
pleasing
illusion
before
the
pinnace
of
the
lover
affections
was
caught
in
some
eddy
of
the
lady
caprice
and
he
was
whirled
away
from
the
shore
of
his
hopes
without
rudder
or
compass
into
an
ocean
of
mists
and
storms
it
resulted
from
this
system
of
conduct
that
all
that
passed
between
scythrop
and
marionetta
consisted
in
making
and
unmaking
love
he
had
no
opportunity
to
take
measure
of
her
understanding
by
conversations
on
general
subjects
and
on
his
favourite
designs
and
being
left
in
this
respect
to
the
exercise
of
indefinite
conjecture
he
took
it
for
granted
as
most
lovers
would
do
in
similar
circumstances
that
she
had
great
natural
talents
which
she
wasted
at
present
on
trifles
but
coquetry
would
end
with
marriage
and
leave
room
for
philosophy
to
exert
its
influence
on
her
mind
stella
had
no
coquetry
no
disguise
she
was
an
enthusiast
in
subjects
of
general
interest
and
her
conduct
to
scythrop
was
always
uniform
or
rather
showed
a
regular
progression
of
partiality
which
seemed
fast
ripening
into
love
chapter
xi
scythrop
attending
one
day
the
summons
to
dinner
found
in
the
his

the
poet
whom
he
had
known
at
college
and
who
was
a
great
favourite
of
mr

mr

he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving

but
could
not
think
of
doing
so
without
a

his
respected
friends
the
moody
mr

and
the
mysterious
mr
scythrop
the
sublime
mr
flosky
and
the
pathetic
mr
listless
to
all
of
whom
and
the
morbid
hospitality
of
the
melancholy
dwelling
in
which
they
were
then
assembled
he
assured
them
he
should
always
look
back
with
as
much
affection
as
his
lacerated
spirit
could
feel
for
any
thing
the
sympathetic
condolence
of
their
respective
replies
was
cut
short
by
raven
announcement
of
on
table
the
conversation
that
took
place
when
the
wine
was
in
circulation
and
the
ladies
were
withdrawn
we
shall
report
with
our
usual
scrupulous
fidelity
mr
glowry
you
are
leaving
england
mr
cypress
there
is
a
delightful
melancholy
in
saying
farewell
to
an
old
acquaintance
when
the
chances
are
twenty
to
one
against
ever
meeting
again
a
smiling
bumper
to
a
sad
parting
and
let
us
all
be
unhappy
together
mr

a
this
is
the
only
social
habit
that
the
disappointed
spirit
never
unlearns
the
reverend
mr

it
is
the
only
piece
of
academical
learning
that
the
finished
educatee
retains
mr
flosky
it
is
the
only
objective
fact
which
the
sceptic
can
realise
scythrop
it
is
the
only
styptic
for
a
bleeding
heart
the
honourable
mr
listless
it
is
the
only
trouble
that
is
very
well
worth
taking
mr
asterias
it
is
the
only
key

mr

it
is
the
only
antidote
to
the
great
wrath
of

mr

it
is
the
only
symbol
of
perfect
life
the
inscription
non
bibitur
will
suit
nothing
but
a
tombstone
mr
glowry
you
will
see
many
fine
old
ruins
mr

crumbling
pillars
and
mossy
walls
many
a
venus
and
headless
minerva
many
a
neptune
buried
in
sand
many
a
jupiter
turned
many
a
perforated
bacchus
doing
duty
as
a
many
reminiscences
of
the
ancient
world
which
i
hope
was
better
worth
living
in
than
the
modern
though
for
myself
i
care
not
a
straw
more
for
one
than
the
other
and
would
not
go
twenty
miles
to
see
any
thing
that
either
could
show
mr
cypress
it
is
something
to
seek
mr
glowry
the
mind
is
restless
and
must
persist
in
seeking
though
to
find
is
to
be
disappointed
do
you
feel
no
aspirations
towards
the
countries
of
socrates
and
cicero
no
wish
to
wander
among
the
venerable
remains
of
the
greatness
that
has
passed
for
ever
mr
glowry
not
a
grain
scythrop
it
is
indeed
much
the
same
as
if
a
lover
should
dig
up
the
buried
form
of
his
mistress
and
gaze
upon
relics
which
are
any
thing
but
herself
to
wander
among
a
few
mouldy
ruins
that
are
only
imperfect
indexes
to
lost
volumes
of
glory
and
meet
at
every
step
the
more
melancholy
ruins
of
human
nature
a
degenerate
race
of
stupid
and
shrivelled
slaves
grovelling
in
the
lowest
depths
of
servility
and
superstition
the
honourable
mr
listless
it
is
the
fashion
to
go
abroad
i
have
thought
of
it
myself
but
am
hardly
equal
to
the
exertion
to
be
sure
a
little
eccentricity
and
originality
are
allowable
in
some
cases
and
the
most
eccentric
and
original
of
all
characters
is
an
englishman
who
stays
at
home
scythrop
i
should
have
no
pleasure
in
visiting
countries
that
are
past
all
hope
of
regeneration
there
is
great
hope
of
our
own
and
it
seems
to
me
that
an
englishman
who
either
by
his
station
in
society
or
by
his
genius
or
as
in
your
instance
mr
cypress
by
both
has
the
power
of
essentially
serving
his
country
in
its
arduous
struggle
with
its
domestic
enemies
yet
forsakes
his
country
which
is
still
so
rich
in
hope
to
dwell
in
others
which
are
only
fertile
in
the
ruins
of
memory
does
what
none
of
those
ancients
whose
fragmentary
memorials
you
venerate
would
have
done
in
similar
circumstances
mr
cypress
sir
i
have
quarrelled
with
my
wife
and
a
man
who
has
quarrelled
with
his
wife
is
absolved
from
all
duty
to
his
country
i
have
written
an
ode
to
tell
the
people
as
much
and
they
may
take
it
as
they
list
scythrop
do
you
suppose
if
brutus
had
quarrelled
with
his
wife
he
would
have
given
it
as
a
reason
to
cassius
for
having
nothing
to
do
with
his
enterprise
or
would
cassius
have
been
satisfied
with
such
an
excuse
mr
flosky
brutus
was
a
senator
so
is
our
dear
friend
but
the
cases
are
different
brutus
had
some
hope
of
political
good
mr
cypress
has
none
how
should
he
after
what
we
have
seen
in
france
scythrop
a
frenchman
is
born
in
harness
ready
saddled
bitted
and
bridled
for
any
tyrant
to
ride
he
will
fawn
under
his
rider
one
moment
and
throw
him
and
kick
him
to
death
the
next
but
another
adventurer
springs
on
his
back
and
by
dint
of
whip
and
spur
on
he
goes
as
before
we
may
without
much
vanity
hope
better
of
ourselves
mr
cypress
i
have
no
hope
for
myself
or
for
others
our
life
is
a
false
nature
it
is
not
in
the
harmony
of
things
it
is
an
upas
whose
root
is
earth
and
whose
leaves
are
the
skies
which
rain
their
upon
mankind
we
wither
from
our
youth
we
gasp
with
unslaked
thirst
for
unattainable
good
lured
from
the
first
to
the
last
by
phantoms
love
fame
ambition
avarice
all
idle
and
all
ill
one
meteor
of
many
names
that
vanishes
in
the
smoke
of
death
mr
flosky
a
most
delightful
speech
mr
cypress
a
most
amiable
and
instructive
philosophy
you
have
only
to
impress
its
truth
on
the
minds
of
all
living
men
and
life
will
then
indeed
be
the
desert
and
the
solitude
and
i
must
do
you
myself
and
our
mutual
friends
the
justice
to
observe
that
let
society
only
give
fair
play
at
one
and
the
same
time
as
i
flatter
myself
it
is
inclined
to
do
to
your
system
of
morals
and
my
system
of
metaphysics
and
scythrop
system
of
politics
and
mr
listless
system
of
manners
and
mr
system
of
religion
and
the
result
will
be
as
fine
a
mental
chaos
as
even
the
immortal
kant
himself
could
ever
have
hoped
to
see
in
the
prospect
of
which
i
rejoice
mr
hilary
ancient
it
is
not
a
thing
to
rejoice
at
i
am
one
of
those
who
can
not
see
the
good
that
is
to
result
from
all
this
mystifying
and
of
society
the
contrast
it
presents
to
the
cheerful
and
solid
wisdom
of
antiquity
is
too
forcible
not
to
strike
any
one
who
has
the
least
knowledge
of
classical
literature
to
represent
vice
and
misery
as
the
necessary
accompaniments
of
genius
is
as
mischievous
as
it
is
false
and
the
feeling
is
as
unclassical
as
the
language
in
which
it
is
usually
expressed
mr
toobad
it
is
our
calamity
the
devil
has
come
among
us
and
has
begun
by
taking
possession
of
all
the
cleverest
fellows
yet
forsooth
this
is
the
enlightened
age
marry
how
did
our
ancestors
go
peeping
about
with
dark
lanterns
and
do
we
walk
at
our
ease
in
broad
sunshine
where
is
the
manifestation
of
our
light
by
what
symptoms
do
you
recognise
it
what
are
its
signs
its
tokens
its
symptoms
its
symbols
its
categories
its
conditions
what
is
it
and
why
how
where
when
is
it
to
be
seen
felt
and
understood
what
do
we
see
by
it
which
our
ancestors
saw
not
and
which
at
the
same
time
is
worth
seeing
we
see
a
hundred
men
hanged
where
they
saw
one
we
see
five
hundred
transported
where
they
saw
one
we
see
five
thousand
in
the
workhouse
where
they
saw

we
see
scores
of
bible
societies
where
they
saw
none
we
see
paper
where
they
saw
gold
we
see
men
in
stays
where
they
saw
men
in
armour
we
see
painted
faces
where
they
saw
healthy
ones
we
see
children
perishing
in
manufactories
where
they
saw
them
flourishing
in
the
fields
we
see
prisons
where
they
saw

we
see

where
they

in
short
they
saw
true

where
we

false
knaves
they
saw
milton
and
we
see
mr

mr
flosky
the
false
knave
sir
is
my
honest
friend
therefore
i
beseech
you
let
him
be
countenanced
god
forbid
but
a
knave
should
have
some
countenance
at
his
friend
request
mr
toobad
men
and
true
was
their
common
term
like
the
chalos
chagathos
of
the
athenians
it
is
so
long
since
men
have
been
either
good
or
true
that
it
is
to
be
questioned
which
is
most
obsolete
the
fact
or
the
phraseology
mr
cypress
there
is
no
worth
nor
beauty
but
in
the
mind
idea
love
sows
the
wind
and
reaps
the
whirlwind
confusion
thrice
confounded
is
the
portion
of
him
who
rests
even
for
an
instant
on
that
most
brittle
of
reeds
the
affection
of
a
human
being
the
sum
of
our
social
destiny
is
to
inflict
or
to
endure
mr
hilary
rather
to
bear
and
forbear
mr
cypress
a
maxim
which
you
perhaps
despise
ideal
beauty
is
not
the
mind
creation
it
is
real
beauty
refined
and
purified
in
the
mind
alembic
from
the
alloy
which
always
more
or
less
accompanies
it
in
our
mixed
and
imperfect
nature
but
still
the
gold
exists
in
a
very
ample
degree
to
expect
too
much
is
a
disease
in
the
expectant
for
which
human
nature
is
not
responsible
and
in
the
common
name
of
humanity
i
protest
against
these
false
and
mischievous
ravings
to
rail
against
humanity
for
not
being
abstract
perfection
and
against
human
love
for
not
realising
all
the
splendid
visions
of
the
poets
of
chivalry
is
to
rail
at
the
summer
for
not
being
all
sunshine
and
at
the
rose
for
not
being
always
in
bloom
mr
cypress
human
love
love
is
not
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
we
worship
him
as
the
athenians
did
their
unknown
god
but
broken
hearts
are
the
martyrs
of
his
faith
and
the
eye
shall
never
see
the
form
which
phantasy
paints
and
which
passion
pursues
through
paths
of
delusive
beauty
among
flowers
whose
odours
are
agonies
and
trees
whose
gums
are
poison
mr
hilary
you
talk
like
a
rosicrucian
who
will
love
nothing
but
a
sylph
who
does
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
sylph
and
who
yet
quarrels
with
the
whole
universe
for
not
containing
a
sylph
mr
cypress
the
mind
is
diseased
of
its
own
beauty
and
fevers
into
false
creation
the
forms
which
the
sculptor
soul
has
seized
exist
only
in
himself
mr
flosky
permit
me
to
discept
they
are
the
mediums
of
common
forms
combined
and
arranged
into
a
common
standard
the
ideal
beauty
of
the
helen
of
zeuxis
was
the
combined
medium
of
the
real
beauty
of
the
virgins
of
crotona
mr
hilary
but
to
make
ideal
beauty
the
shadow
in
the
water
and
like
the
dog
in
the
fable
to
throw
away
the
substance
in
catching
at
the
shadow
is
scarcely
the
characteristic
of
wisdom
whatever
it
may
be
of
genius
to
reconcile
man
as
he
is
to
the
world
as
it
is
to
preserve
and
improve
all
that
is
good
and
destroy
or
alleviate
all
that
is
evil
in
physical
and
moral
nature
have
been
the
hope
and
aim
of
the
greatest
teachers
and
ornaments
of
our
species
i
will
say
too
that
the
highest
wisdom
and
the
highest
genius
have
been
invariably
accompanied
with
cheerfulness
we
have
sufficient
proofs
on
record
that
shakspeare
and
socrates
were
the
most
festive
of
companions
but
now
the
little
wisdom
and
genius
we
have
seem
to
be
entering
into
a
conspiracy
against
cheerfulness
mr
toobad
how
can
we
be
cheerful
with
the
devil
among
us
the
honourable
mr
listless
how
can
we
be
cheerful
when
our
nerves
are
shattered
mr
flosky
how
can
we
be
cheerful
when
we
are
surrounded
by
a
that
is
growing
too
wise
for
its
betters
scythrop
how
can
we
be
cheerful
when
our
great
general
designs
are
crossed
every
moment
by
our
little
particular
passions
mr
cypress
how
can
we
be
cheerful
in
the
midst
of
disappointment
and
despair
mr
glowry
let
us
all
be
unhappy
together
mr
hilary
let
us
sing
a
catch
mr
glowry
no
a
nice
tragical
ballad
the
norfolk
tragedy
to
the
tune
of
the
hundredth
psalm
mr
hilary
i
say
a
catch
mr
glowry
i
say
no
a
song
from
mr
cypress
all
a
song
from
mr
cypress
mr
cypress
there
is
a
fever
of
the
spirit
the
brand
of
cain
unresting
doom
which
in
the
lone
dark
souls
that
bear
it
glows
like
the
lamp
in
tullia
tomb
unlike
that
lamp
its
subtle
fire
burns
blasts
consumes
its
cell
the
heart
till
one
by
one
hope
joy
desire
like
dreams
of
shadowy
smoke
depart
when
hope
love
life
itself
are
only
dust
spectral
memories
dead
and
cold
the
unfed
fire
burns
bright
and
lonely
like
that
undying
lamp
of
old
and
by
that
drear
illumination
till
time
its
home
has
rent
thought
broods
on
feeling
desolation
the
soul
is
its
own
monument
mr

let
us
all
be
unhappy

this

was
so
well
executed
by
the
spirit

science
of
mr
hilary
and
the
deep
voice
of
the
reverend
gentleman
that
the
whole
party
in
spite
of
themselves
caught
the
contagion
and
joined
in
chorus
at

conclusion

raising
a
bumper
to
his

mr

stepped
the

evening
into

departed
to
rake

it
was
the
custom
of
the
honourable
mr
listless
on
adjourning
from
the
bottle
to
the
ladies
to
retire
for
a
few
moments
to
make
a
second
toilette
that
he
might
present
himself
in
becoming
taste
fatout
attending
as
usual
appeared
with
a
countenance
of
great
dismay
and
informed
his
master
that
he
had
just
ascertained
that
the
abbey
was
haunted
mrs
hilary
for
whom
fatout
had
lately
conceived
a
had
been
as
she
expressed
it
out
of
her
seventeen
senses
the
preceding
night
as
she
was
retiring
to
her
bedchamber
by
a
ghastly
figure
which
she
had
met
stalking
along
one
of
the
galleries
wrapped
in
a
white
shroud
with
a
bloody
turban
on
its
head
she
had
fainted
away
with
fear
and
when
she
recovered
she
found
herself
in
the
dark
and
the
figure
was
gone
cochon
exclaimed
fatout
giving
very
deliberate
emphasis
to
every
portion
of
his
terrible
oath
vould
not
meet
de
de
ghost
not
for
all
de
in
de

said
the
honourable
mr

i
ever
see
a
ghost
monsieur
never
i
hope
i
never
shall
for
in
the
present
shattered
state
of
my
nerves
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
too
much
for
me
there
loosen
the
lace
of
my
stays
a
little
for
really
this
plebeian
practice
of
eating
not
too
loose
consider
my
shape
that
will
do
and
i
desire
that
you
bring
me
no
more
stories
of
ghosts
for
though
i
do
not
believe
in
such
things
yet
when
one
is
awake
in
the
night
one
is
apt
if
one
thinks
of
them
to
have
fancies
that
give
one
a
kind
of
a
chill
particularly
if
one
opens
one
eyes
suddenly
on
one
dressing
gown
hanging
in
the
moonlight
between
the
bed
and
the
window
the
honourable
mr
listless
though
he
had
prohibited
fatout
from
bringing
him
any
more
stories
of
ghosts
could
not
help
thinking
of
that
which
fatout
had
already
brought
and
as
it
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
when
he
descended
to
the
tea
and
coffee
cups
and
the
rest
of
the
company
in
the
library
he
almost
involuntarily
asked
mr
flosky
whom
he
looked
up
to
as
a
most
oraculous
personage
whether
any
story
of
any
ghost
that
had
ever
appeared
to
any
one
was
entitled
to
any
degree
of
belief
mr
flosky
by
far
the
greater
number
to
a
very
great
degree
the
honourable
mr
listless
really
that
is
very
alarming
mr
flosky
geminoe
somni
there
are
two
gates
through
which
ghosts
find
their
way
to
the
upper
air
fraud
and
in
the
latter
case
a
ghost
is
a
an
ocular
spectrum
an
idea
with
the
force
of
a
sensation
i
have
seen
many
ghosts
myself
i
dare
say
there
are
few
in
this
company
who
have
not
seen
a
ghost
the
honourable
mr
listless
i
am
happy
to
say
i
never
have
for
one
the
reverend
mr
larynx
we
have
such
high
authority
for
ghosts
that
it
is
rank
scepticism
to
disbelieve
them

came
for
the
express
purpose
of
asking

did

interrogated

on

those

severely
for

those
who
heard
them
by

passed
with
impunity

i
once
saw
a

in

place

any
one
but
a
ghost
would
look
for
me
i
had
not
been
into
it
for
three
months
and
was
going
to
consult
tillotson
when
on
opening
the
door
i
saw
a
venerable
figure
in
a
flannel
dressing
gown
sitting
in
my
and
reading
my
jeremy
taylor
it
vanished
in
a
moment
and
so
did
i
and
what
it
was
or
what
it
wanted
i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
mr
flosky
it
was
an
idea
with
the
force
of
a
sensation
it
is
seldom
that
ghosts
appeal
to
two
senses
at
once
but
when
i
was
in
devonshire
the
following
story
was
well
attested
to
me
a
young
woman
whose
lover
was
at
sea
returning
one
evening
over
some
solitary
fields
saw
her
lover
sitting
on
a
stile
over
which
she
was
to
pass
her
first
emotions
were
surprise
and
joy
but
there
was
a
paleness
and
seriousness
in
his
face
that
made
them
give
place
to
alarm
she
advanced
towards
him
and
he
said
to
her
in
a
solemn
voice
eye
that
hath
seen
me
shall
see
me
no
more
thine
eye
is
upon
me
but
i
am
not
and
with
these
words
he
vanished
and
on
that
very
day
and
hour
as
it
afterwards
appeared
he
had
perished
by
shipwreck
the
whole
party
now
drew
round
in
a
circle
and
each
related
some
ghostly
anecdote
heedless
of
the
flight
of
time
till
in
a
pause
of
the
conversation
they
heard
the
hollow
tongue
of
midnight
sounding
twelve
mr
hilary
all
these
anecdotes
admit
of
solution
on
psychological
principles
it
is
more
easy
for
a
soldier
a
philosopher
or
even
a
saint
to
be
frightened
at
his
own
shadow
than
for
a
dead
man
to
come
out
of
his
grave
medical
writers
cite
a
thousand
singular
examples
of
the
force
of
imagination
persons
of
feeble
nervous
melancholy
temperament
exhausted
by
fever
by
labour
or
by
spare
diet
will
readily
conjure
up
in
the
magic
ring
of
their
own
phantasy
spectres
gorgons
chimaeras
and
all
the
objects
of
their
hatred
and
their
love
we
are
most
of
us
like
don
quixote
to
whom
a
windmill
was
a
giant
and
dulcinea
a
magnificent
princess
all
more
or
less
the
dupes
of
our
own
imagination
though
we
do
not
all
go
so
far
as
to
see
ghosts
or
to
fancy
ourselves
pipkins
and
teapots
mr
flosky
i
can
safely
say
i
have
seen
too
many
ghosts
myself
to
believe
in
their
external
existence
i
have
seen
all
kinds
of
ghosts
black
spirits
and
white
red
spirits
and
grey
some
in
the
shapes
of
venerable
old
men
who
have
met
me
in
my
rambles
at
noon
some
of
beautiful
young
women
who
have
peeped
through
my
curtains
at
midnight
the
honourable
mr
listless
and
have
proved
i
doubt
not
to
feeling
as
to
sight
mr
flosky
by
no
means
sir
you
reflect
upon
my
purity
myself
and
my
friends
particularly
my
friend
mr
sackbut
are
famous
for
our
purity
no
sir
genuine
untangible
ghosts
i
live
in
a
world
of
ghosts
i
see
a
ghost
at
this
moment
mr
flosky
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
library
the
company
looked
in
the
same
direction
the
door
silently
opened
and
a
ghastly
figure
shrouded
in
white
drapery
with
the
semblance
of
a
bloody
turban
on
its
head
entered
and
stalked
slowly
up
the
apartment
mr
flosky
familiar
as
he
was
with
ghosts
was
not
prepared
for
this
apparition
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
out
at
the
opposite
door
mrs
hilary
and
marionetta
followed
screaming
the
honourable
mr
listless
by
two
turns
of
his
body
rolled
first
off
the
sofa
and
then
under
it
the
reverend
mr
larynx
leaped
up
and
fled
with
so
much
precipitation
that
he
overturned
the
table
on
the
foot
of
mr
glowry
mr
glowry
roared
with
pain
in
the
ear
of
mr
toobad
mr
toobad
alarm
so
bewildered
his
senses
that
missing
the
door
he
threw
up
one
of
the
windows
jumped
out
in
his
panic
and
plunged
over
head
and
ears
in
the
moat
mr
asterias
and
his
son
who
were
on
the
watch
for
their
mermaid
were
attracted
by
the
splashing
threw
a
net
over
him
and
dragged
him
to
land
scythrop
and
mr
hilary
meanwhile
had
hastened
to
his
assistance
and
on
arriving
at
the
edge
of
the
moat
followed
by
several
servants
with
ropes
and
torches
found
mr
asterias
and
aquarius
busy
in
endeavouring
to
extricate
mr
toobad
from
the
net
who
was
entangled
in
the
meshes
and
floundering
with
rage
scythrop
was
lost
in
amazement
but
mr
hilary
saw
at
one
view
all
the
circumstances
of
the
adventure
and
burst
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
on
recovering
from
which
he
said
to
mr
asterias
have
caught
an
odd
fish
indeed
mr
toobad
was
highly
exasperated
at
this
unseasonable
pleasantry
but
mr
hilary
softened
his
anger
by
producing
a
knife
and
cutting
the
gordian
knot
of
his
reticular
envelopment
see
said
mr
toobad
see
gentlemen
in
my
unfortunate
person
proof
upon
proof
of
the
present
dominion
of
the
devil
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
the
apparition
of
this
night
was
apollyon
himself
in
disguise
sent
for
the
express
purpose
of
terrifying
me
into
this
complication
of
misadventures
the
devil
is
come
among
you
having
great
wrath
because
he
knoweth
that
he

a
short
time
chapter
xiii
mr
glowry
was
much
surprised
on
occasionally
visiting
tower
to
find
the
door
always
locked
and
to
be
kept
sometimes
waiting
many
minutes
for
admission
during
which
he
invariably
heard
a
heavy
rolling
sound
like
that
of
a
ponderous
mangle
or
of
a
waggon
on
a
or
of
theatrical
thunder
he
took
little
notice
of
this
for
some
time
at
length
his
curiosity
was
excited
and
one
day
instead
of
knocking
at
the
door
as
usual
the
instant
he
reached
it
he
applied
his
ear
to
the
and
like
bottom
in
the
midsummer
night
dream
a
voice
which
he
guessed
to
be
of
the
feminine
gender
and
knew
to
be
not
scythrop
whose
deeper
tones
he
distinguished
at
intervals
having
attempted
in
vain
to
catch
a
syllable
of
the
discourse
he
knocked
violently
at
the
door
and
roared
for
immediate
admission
the
voices
ceased
the
accustomed
rolling
sound
was
heard
the
door
opened
and
scythrop
was
discovered
alone
mr
glowry
looked
round
to
every
corner
of
the
apartment
and
then
said
is
the
lady
lady
sir
said
scythrop
sir
the
lady
i
do
not
understand
you
do
sir
indeed
sir
there
is
no
lady
here
sir
this
is
not
the
only
apartment
in
the
tower
and
i
make
no
doubt
there
is
a
lady
up
stairs
are
welcome
to
search
sir
and
while
i
am
searching
she
will
slip
out
from
some
lurking
place
and
make
her
escape
may
lock
this
door
sir
and
take
the
key
with
you
there
is
the
terrace
door
she
has
escaped
by
the
terrace
terrace
sir
has
no
other
outlet
and
the
walls
are
too
high
for
a
lady
to
jump
down
sir
give
me
the
key
mr
glowry
took
the
key
searched
every
nook
of
the
tower
and
returned
are
a
fox
scythrop
you
are
an
exceedingly
cunning
fox
with
that
demure
visage
of
yours
what
was
that
lumbering
sound
i
heard
before
you
opened
the
door
sir
sir
sound
dear
sir
i
am
not
aware
of
any
sound
except
my
great
table
which
i
moved
on
rising
to
let
you
in
table
let
me
see
that
no
sir
not
a
tenth
part
heavy
enough
not
a
tenth
part
sir
you
do
not
consider
the
laws
of
acoustics
a
whisper
becomes
a
peal
of
thunder
in
the
focus
of
reverberation
allow
me
to
explain
this
sounds
striking
on
concave
surfaces
are
reflected
from
them
and
after
reflection
converge
to
points
which
are
the
foci
of
these
surfaces
it
follows
therefore
that
the
ear
may
be
so
placed
in
one
as
that
it
shall
hear
a
sound
better
than
when
situated
nearer
to
the
point
of
the
first
impulse
again
in
the
case
of
two
concave
surfaces
placed
opposite
to
each
other
sir
do
tell
me
of
foci
pray
sir
will
concave
surfaces
produce
two
voices
when
nobody
speaks
i
heard
two
voices
and
one
was
feminine
feminine
sir
what
say
you
to
that
sir
i
perceive
your
mistake
i
am
writing
a
tragedy
and
was
acting
over
a
scene
to
myself
to
convince
you
i
will
give
you
a
specimen
but
you
must
first
understand
the
plot
it
is
a
tragedy
on
the
german
model
the
great
mogul
is
in
exile
and
has
taken
lodgings
at
kensington
with
his
only
daughter
the
princess
rantrorina
who
takes
in
needlework
and
keeps
a
day
school
princess
is
discovered
hemming
a
set
of
shirts
for
the
parson
of
the
parish
they
are
to
be
marked
with
a
large
enter
to
her
the
great
mogul
a
pause
during
which
they
look
at
each
other
expressively
the
princess
changes
colour
several
times
the
mogul
takes
snuff
in
great
agitation
several
grains
are
heard
to
fall
on
the
stage
his
heart
is
seen
to
beat
through
his
upper
the
mogul
with
a
mournful
look
at
his
left
is
broken
the
princess
an
interval
of
melancholy
know
it
the
mogul
second
the
first
broke
when
i
lost
my
empire
the
second
has
broken
when
will
my
poor
heart
break
the
princess
hearts
and
empires
mysterious
sympathy
sir
interrupted
mr
glowry
is
not
at
all
like
the
voice
i
heard
sir
said
scythrop
may
be
so
constructed
as
to
act
like
an
acoustic
tube
and
an
acoustic
tube
sir
will
modify
sound
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
consider
the
construction
of
the
ear
and
the
nature
and
causes
of
sound
the
external
part
of
the
ear
is
a
cartilaginous
funnel
do
scythrop
there
is
a
girl
concealed
in
this
tower
and
find
her
i
will
there
are
such
things
as
sliding
panels
and
secret
closets
he
sounded
round
the
room
with
his
cane
but
detected
no
have
heard
sir
he
continued
during
my
absence
two
years
ago
you
had
a
dumb
carpenter
closeted
with
you
day
after
day
i
did
not
dream
that
you
were
laying
contrivances
for
carrying
on
secret
intrigues
young
men
will
have
their
way
i
had
my
way
when
i
was
a
young
man
but
sir
when
your
cousin
marionetta
scythrop
now
saw
that
the
affair
was
growing
serious
to
have
clapped
his
hand
upon
his
father
mouth
to
have
entreated
him
to
be
silent
would
in
the
first
place
not
have
made
him
so
and
in
the
second
would
have
shown
a
dread
of
being
overheard
by
somebody
his
only
resource
therefore
was
to
try
to
drown
mr
glowry
voice
and
having
no
other
subject
he
continued
his
description
of
the
ear
raising
his
voice
continually
as
mr
glowry
raised
his
your
cousin
marionetta
said
mr
glowry
you
profess
to
love
whom
you
profess
to
love
sir
internal
canal
of
the
ear
said
scythrop
partly
bony
and
partly
cartilaginous
this
internal
canal
is
actually
in
the
house
sir
and
when
you
are
so
shortly
to
be
as
i
expect
at
the
further
end
by
the
together
in
holy
matrimony
which
is
carried
a
branch
of
the
fifth
pair
of
nerves
say
sir
when
you
are
so
shortly
to
be
married
to
your
cousin
marionetta
a
loud
noise
was
heard
behind
the
which
to
the
astonishment
of
mr
glowry
opened
in
the
middle
and
the
massy
compartments
with
all
their
weight
of
books
receding
from
each
other
in
the
manner
of
a
theatrical
scene
with
a
heavy
rolling
sound
which
mr
glowry
immediately
recognised
to
be
the
same
which
had
excited
his
curiosity
disclosed
an
interior
apartment
in
the
entrance
of
which
stood
the
beautiful
stella
who
stepping
forward
exclaimed
is
he
going
to
be
married
the
profligate
madam
said
mr
glowry
do
not
know
what
he
is
going
to
do
or
what
i
am
going
to
do
or
what
any
one
is
going
to
do
for
all
this
is
incomprehensible
can
explain
it
all
said
scythrop
a
most
satisfactory
manner
if
you
will
but
have
the
goodness
to
leave
us
alone
sir
to
which
act
of
the
tragedy
of
the
great
mogul
does
this
incident
belong
entreat
you
my
dear
sir
leave
us
alone
stella
threw
herself
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
a
tempest
of
tears
scythrop
sat
down
by
her
and
took
her
hand
she
snatched
her
hand
away
and
turned
her
back
upon
him
he
rose
sat
down
on
the
other
side
and
took
her
other
hand
she
snatched
it
away
and
turned
from
him
again
scythrop
continued
entreating
mr
glowry
to
leave
them
alone
but
the
old
gentleman
was
obstinate
and
would
not
go
suppose
after
all
said
mr
glowry
maliciously
is
only
a
phænomenon
in
acoustics
and
this
young
lady
is
a
reflection
of
sound
from
concave
surfaces
some
one
tapped
at
the
door
mr
glowry
opened
it
and
mr
hilary
entered
he
had
been
seeking
mr
glowry
and
had
traced
him
to
scythrop
tower
he
stood
a
few
moments
in
silent
surprise
and
then
addressed
himself
to
mr
glowry
for
an
explanation
explanation
said
mr
glowry
very
satisfactory
the
great
mogul
has
taken
lodgings
at
kensington
and
the
external
part
of
the
ear
is
a
cartilaginous
funnel
glowry
that
is
no
explanation
hilary
it
is
all
i
know
about
the
matter
this
pleasantry
is
very
unseasonable
i
perceive
that
my
niece
is
sported
with
in
a
most
unjustifiable
manner
and
i
shall
see
if
she
will
be
more
successful
in
obtaining
an
intelligible
answer
and
he
departed
in
search
of
marionetta
scythrop
was
now
in
a
hopeless
predicament
mr
hilary
made
a
hue
and
cry
in
the
abbey
and
summoned
his
wife
and
marionetta
to
apartment
the
ladies
not
knowing
what
was
the
matter
hastened
in
great
consternation
mr
toobad
saw
them
sweeping
along
the
corridor
and
judging
from
their
manner
that
the
devil
had
manifested
his
wrath
in
some
new
shape
followed
from
pure
curiosity
scythrop
meanwhile
vainly
endeavoured
to
get
rid
of
mr
glowry
and
to
pacify
stella
the
latter
attempted
to
escape
from
the
tower
declaring
she
would
leave
the
abbey
immediately
and
he
should
never
see
her
or
hear
of
her
more
scythrop
held
her
hand
and
detained
her
by
force
till
mr
hilary
reappeared
with
mrs
hilary
and
marionetta
marionetta
seeing
scythrop
grasping
the
hand
of
a
strange
beauty
fainted
away
in
the
arms
of
her
aunt
scythrop
flew
to
her
assistance
and
stella
with
redoubled
anger
sprang
towards
the
door
but
was
intercepted
in
her
intended
flight
by
being
caught
in
the
arms
of
mr
toobad
who
exclaimed
said
the
young
lady
disconsolately
devil
is
come
among
you
said
mr
toobad
came
my
daughter
here
daughter
exclaimed
mr
glowry
daughter
exclaimed
scythrop
and
mr
and
mrs
hilary
said
mr
toobad
daughter
celinda
marionetta
opened
her
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
celinda
celinda
in
return
fixed
hers
on
marionetta
they
were
at
remote
points
of
the
apartment
scythrop
was
equidistant
from
both
of
them
central
and
motionless
like
mahomet
coffin
glowry
said
mr
toobad
you
tell
by
what
means
my
daughter
came
here
know
no
more
said
mr
glowry
the
great
mogul
scythrop
said
mr
toobad
came
my
daughter
here
did
not
know
sir
that
the
lady
was
your
daughter
how
came
she
here
spontaneous
locomotion
said
scythrop
sullenly
said
mr
toobad
does
all
this
mean
really
do
not
know
sir
is
most
unaccountable
when
i
told
you
in
london
that
i
had
chosen
a
husband
for
you
you
thought
proper
to
run
away
from
him
and
now
to
all
appearance
you
have
run
away
to
him
sir
was
that
your
choice
and
if
he
is
yours
too
we
shall
be
both
of
a
mind

this

i
renounce

said
marionetta
scythrop
knew
not
what
to
do
he
could
not
attempt
to
conciliate
the
one
without
irreparably
offending
the
other
and
he
was
so
fond
of
both
that
the
idea
of
depriving
himself
for
ever
of
the
society
of
either
was
intolerable
to
him
he
therefore
retreated
into
his
stronghold
mystery
maintained
an
impenetrable
silence
and
contented
himself
with
stealing
occasionally
a
deprecating
glance
at
each
of
the
objects
of
his
idolatry
mr
toobad
and
mr
hilary
in
the
mean
time
were
each
insisting
on
an
explanation
from
mr
glowry
who
they
thought
had
been
playing
a
double
game
on
this
occasion
mr
glowry
was
vainly
endeavouring
to
persuade
them
of
his
innocence
in
the
whole
transaction
mrs
hilary
was
endeavouring
to
mediate
between
her
husband
and
brother
the
honourable
mr
listless
the
reverend
mr
larynx
mr
flosky
mr
asterias
and
aquarius
were
attracted
by
the
tumult
to
the
scene
of
action
and
were
appealed
to
severally
and
conjointly
by
the
respective
disputants
multitudinous
questions
and
answers
composed
a
to
which
the
genius
of
rossini
alone
could
have
given
a
suitable
accompaniment
and
which
was
only
terminated
by
mrs
hilary
and
mr
toobad
retreating
with
the
captive
damsels
the
whole
party
followed
with
the
exception
of
scythrop

threw
himself
into
his
crossed

left
foot

his
right
knee

the
hollow
of
his
left
hand

of

leg

right
elbow

elbow
of

the
ball
of
his
right
thumb

right
temple

the
forefinger
along
the
upper
part
of

the
point

finger
on
the
bridge
of
his
nose
and
the
points
of
the
two
others
on
the
lower
part
of
the
palm
fixed
his
eyes
intently
on
the
veins
in
the
back
of
his

sat
in
this
position
like
the
immoveable

scythrop

still
in

position
when

party

very
much
reduced
already
how
honourable
mr
listless
is
gone
he
declared
that
what
with
family
quarrels
in
the
morning
and
ghosts
at
night
he
could
get
neither
sleep
nor
peace
and
that
the
agitation
was
too
much
for
his
nerves
though
mr
glowry
assured
him
that
the
ghost
was
only
poor
crow
walking
in
his
sleep
and
that
the
shroud
and
bloody
turban
were
a
sheet
and
a
red
nightcap

and

scythrop
had
dined
and
was
sipping
his
madeira
alone
immersed
in
melancholy
musing
when
mr
glowry
entered
followed
by
raven
who
having
placed
an
additional
glass
and
set
a
chair
for
mr
glowry
withdrew
mr
glowry
sat
down
opposite
scythrop
after
a
pause
during
which
each
filled
and
drank
in
silence
mr
glowry
said
sir
you
have
played
your
cards
well
i
proposed
miss
toobad
to
you
you
refused
her
mr
toobad
proposed
you
to
her
she
refused
you
you
fell
in
love
with
marionetta
and
were
going
to
poison
yourself
because
from
pure
fatherly
regard
to
your
temporal
interests
i
withheld
my
consent
when
at
length
i
offered
you
my
consent
you
told
me
i
was
too
precipitate
and
after
all
i
find
you
and
miss
toobad
living
together
in
the
same
tower
and
behaving
in
every
respect
like
two
plighted
lovers
now
sir
if
there
be
any
rational
solution
of
all
this
absurdity
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
a
small
glimmering
of
information
solution
sir
is
of
little
moment
but
i
will
leave
it
in
writing
for
your
satisfaction
the
crisis
of
my
fate
is
come
the
world
is
a
stage
and
my
direction
is
not
talk
so
sir
do
not
talk
so
scythrop
what
would
you
have
would
have
my
love
pray
sir
who
is
your
love
marionetta
either
both
that
may
do
very
well
in
a
german
tragedy
and
the
great
mogul
might
have
found
it
very
feasible
in
his
lodgings
at
kensington
but
it
will
not
do
in
lincolnshire
will
you
have
miss
toobad
renounce
marionetta
you
must
renounce
one
can
not
you
can
not
have
both
what
is
to
be
done
must
shoot
myself
talk
so
scythrop
be
rational
my
dear
scythrop
consider
and
make
a
cool
calm
choice
and
i
will
exert
myself
in
your
behalf
should
i
choose
sir
both
have
renounced
i
have
no
hope
of
either
me
which
you
will
have
and
i
will
plead
your
cause
irresistibly
sir
i
will
have
no
sir
i
can
not
renounce
either
i
can
not
choose
either
i
am
doomed
to
be
the
victim
of
eternal
disappointments
and
i
have
no
resource
but
a
pistol
scythrop
if
one
of
them
should
come
to
you
what
then
sir
might
alter
the
case
but
that
can
not
be
can
be
scythrop
it
will
be
i
promise
you
it
will
be
have
but
a
little
patience
but
a
week
patience
and
it
shall
be
week
sir
is
an
age
but
to
oblige
you
as
a
last
act
of
filial
duty
i
will
live
another
week

is
now
thursday
evening
minutes
past
seven
at
this
hour
and
minute
on
thursday
next
love
and
fate
shall
smile
on
me
or
i
will
drink
my
last
pint
of
port
in
this
world
mr
glowry
ordered
his
travelling
chariot
and
departed
from
the
abbey
chapter
xv
the
day
after
mr
glowry
departure
was
one
of
incessant
rain
and
scythrop
repented
of
the
promise
he
had
given
the
next
day
was
one
of
bright
sunshine
he
sat
on
the
terrace
read
a
tragedy
of
sophocles
and
was
not
sorry
when
raven
announced
dinner
to
find
himself
alive
on
the
third
evening
the
wind
blew
and
the
rain
beat
and
the
owl
flapped
against
his
windows
and
he
put
a
new
flint
in
his
pistol
on
the
fourth
day
the
sun
shone
again
and
he
locked
the
pistol
up
in
a
drawer
where
he
left
it
undisturbed
till
the
morning
of
the
eventful
thursday
when
he
ascended
the
turret
with
a
telescope
and
spied
anxiously
along
the
road
that
crossed
the
fens
from
claydyke
but
nothing
appeared
on
it
he
watched
in
this
manner
from
ten
till
raven
summoned
him
to
dinner
at
five
when
he
stationed
crow
at
the
telescope
and
descended
to
his
own
he
left
open
the
communications
between
the
tower
and
turret
and
called
aloud
at
intervals
to
crow
crow
is
any
thing
coming
crow
answered
wind
blows
and
the
windmills
turn
but
i
see
nothing
coming
and
at
every
answer
scythrop
found
the
necessity
of
raising
his
spirits
with
a
bumper
after
dinner
he
gave
raven
his
watch
to
set
by
the
abbey
clock
raven
brought
it
scythrop
placed
it
on
the
table
and
raven
departed
scythrop
called
again
to
crow
and
crow
who
had
fallen
asleep
answered
mechanically
see
nothing
coming
scythrop
laid
his
pistol
between
his
watch
and
his
bottle
the
passed
the
the
moved
on
it
was
within
three
minutes
of
the
appointed
time
scythrop
called
again
to
crow
crow
answered
as
before
scythrop
rang
the
bell
raven
appeared
said
scythrop
clock
is
too
fast
indeed
said
raven
who
knew
nothing
of
scythrop
intentions
any
thing
it
is
too
slow
said
scythrop
pointing
the
pistol
at
him
is
too
fast
yes
too
fast
i
meant
said
raven
in
manifest
fear
much
too
fast
said
scythrop
much
as
you
please
said
raven
much
i
say
said
scythrop
pointing
the
pistol
again
hour
a
full
hour
sir
said
the
terrified
butler
back
my
watch
said
scythrop
raven
with
trembling
hand
was
putting
back
the
watch
when
the
rattle
of
wheels
was
heard
in
the
court
and
scythrop
springing
down
the
stairs
by
three
steps
together
was
at
the
door
in
sufficient
time
to
have
handed
either
of
the
young
ladies
from
the
carriage
if
she
had
happened
to
be
in
it
but
mr
glowry
was
alone
rejoice
to
see
you
said
mr
glowry
was
fearful
of
being
too
late
for
i
waited
till
the
last
moment
in
the
hope
of
accomplishing
my
promise
but
all
my
endeavours
have
been
vain
as
these
letters
will
show
scythrop
impatiently
broke
the
seals
the
contents
were
these
almost
a
stranger
in
england
i
fled
from
parental
tyranny
and
the
dread
of
an
arbitrary
marriage
to
the
protection
of
a
stranger
and
a
philosopher
whom
i
expected
to
find
something
better
than
or
at
least
something
different
from
the
rest
of
his
worthless
species
could
i
after
what
has
occurred
have
expected
nothing
more
from
you
than
the
impertinence
of
sending
your
father
to
treat
with
me
and
with
mine
for
me
i
should
be
a
little
moved
in
your
favour
if
i
could
believe
you
capable
of
carrying
into
effect
the
resolutions
which
your
father
says
you
have
taken
in
the
event
of
my
proving
inflexible
though
i
doubt
not
you
will
execute
them
as
far
as
relates
to
the
pint
of
wine
twice
over
at
least
i
wish
you
much
happiness
with
miss
i
shall
always
cherish
a
grateful
recollection
of
nightmare
abbey
for
having
been
the
means
of
introducing
me
to
a
true
transcendentalist
and
though
he
is
a
little
older
than
myself
which
is
all
one
in
germany
i
shall
very
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
subscribing
myself
celinda
flosky
i
hope
my
dear
cousin
that
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
but
that
you
will
always
think
of
me
as
a
sincere
friend
who
will
always
feel
interested
in
your
welfare
i
am
sure
you
love
miss
toobad
much
better
than
me
and
i
wish
you
much
happiness
with
her
mr
listless
assures
me
that
people
do
not
kill
themselves
for
love
though
it
is
still
the
fashion
to
talk
about
it
i
shall
in
a
very
short
time
change
my
name
and
situation
and
shall
always
be
happy
to
see
you
in
berkeley
square
when
to
the
unalterable
designation
of
your
affectionate
cousin
i
shall
subjoin
the
signature
of
marionetta
listless
scythrop
tore
both
the
letters
to
atoms
and
railed
in
good
set
terms
against
the
fickleness
of
women
yourself
my
dear
scythrop
said
mr
glowry
are
yet
maidens
in
england
true
sir
said
scythrop
the
next
time
said
mr
glowry
but
one
string
to
your
bow
good
advice
sir
said
scythrop
besides
said
mr
glowry
fatal
time
is
past
for
it
is
now
almost
eight
that
villain
raven
said
scythrop
me
when
he
said
that
the
clock
was
too
fast
but
as
you
observe
very
justly
the
time
has
gone
by
and
i
have
just
reflected
that
these
repeated
crosses
in
love
qualify
me
to
take
a
very
advanced
degree
in
misanthropy
and
there
is
therefore
good
hope
that
i
may
make
a
figure
in
the
world
but
i
shall
ring
for
the
rascal
raven
and
admonish
him
raven
appeared
scythrop
looked
at
him
very
fiercely
two
or
three
minutes
and
raven
still
remembering
the
pistol
stood
quaking
in
mute
apprehension

certainly
went
off
