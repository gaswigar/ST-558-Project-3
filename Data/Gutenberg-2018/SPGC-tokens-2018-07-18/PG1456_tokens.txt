and

dedication
to
monsieur
is
it
not
a
necessity
to
explain
to
a
public
curious
to
know
everything
how
i
came
to
be
sufficiently
learned
in
the
law
to
carry
on
the
business
of
my
little
world
and
in
so
doing
am
i
not
bound
to
put
on
record
the
memory
of
the
amiable
and
intelligent
man
who
meeting
the
scribe
another
at
a
ball
said
just
give
the
office
a
turn
there
is
work
for
you
there
i
assure
you
but
do
you
need
this
public
testimony
to
feel
assured
of
the
affection
of

an
episode
under
the
terror
on
the
of
january
towards
eight
in
the
evening
an
old
lady
came
down
the
steep
street
that
comes
to
an
end
opposite
the
church
of
saint
laurent
in
the
faubourg
saint
martin
it
had
snowed
so
heavily
all
day
long
that
the
lady
footsteps
were
scarcely
audible
the
streets
were
deserted
and
a
feeling
of
dread
not
unnatural
amid
the
silence
was
further
increased
by
the
whole
extent
of
the
terror
beneath
which
france
was
groaning
in
those
days
what
was
more
the
old
lady
so
far
had
met
no
one
by
the
way
her
sight
had
long
been
failing
so
that
the
few
foot
passengers
dispersed
like
shadows
in
the
distance
over
the
wide
thoroughfare
through
the
faubourg
were
quite
invisible
to
her
by
the
light
of
the
lanterns
she
had
passed
the
end
of
the
rue
des
morts
when
she
fancied
that
she
could
hear
the
firm
heavy
tread
of
a
man
walking
behind
her
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
heard
that
sound
before
and
dismayed
by
the
idea
of
being
followed
she
tried
to
walk
faster
toward
a
brightly
lit
shop
window
in
the
hope
of
verifying
the
suspicions
which
had
taken
hold
of
her
mind
so
soon
as
she
stood
in
the
shaft
of
light
that
streamed
out
across
the
road
she
turned
her
head
suddenly
and
caught
sight
of
a
human
figure
looming
through
the
fog
the
dim
vision
was
enough
for
her
for
one
moment
she
reeled
beneath
an
overpowering
weight
of
dread
for
she
could
not
doubt
any
longer
that
the
man
had
followed
her
the
whole
way
from
her
own
door
then
the
desire
to
escape
from
the
spy
gave
her
strength
unable
to
think
clearly
she
walked
twice
as
fast
as
before
as
if
it
were
possible
to
escape
from
a
man
who
of
course
could
move
much
faster
and
for
some
minutes
she
fled
on
till
reaching
a
shop
she
entered
and
sank
rather
than
sat
down
upon
a
chair
by
the
counter
a
young
woman
busy
with
embroidery
looked
up
from
her
work
at
the
rattling
of
the
and
looked
out
through
the
square
she
seemed
to
recognize
the
violet
silk
mantle
for
she
went
at
once
to
a
drawer
as
if
in
search
of
something
put
aside
for
the
newcomer
not
only
did
this
movement
and
the
expression
of
the
woman
face
show
a
very
evident
desire
to
be
rid
as
soon
as
possible
of
an
unwelcome
visitor
but
she
even
permitted
herself
an
impatient
exclamation
when
the
drawer
proved
to
be
empty
without
looking
at
the
lady
she
hurried
from
her
desk
into
the
back
shop
and
called
to
her
husband
who
appeared
at
once
wherever
have
you
put
she
began
mysteriously
glancing
at
the
customer
by
way
of
finishing
her
question
the
could
only
see
the
old
lady
a
huge
black
silk
bonnet
with
knots
of
violet
ribbon
round
it
but
he
looked
at
his
wife
as
if
to
say
did
you
think
i
should
leave
such
a
thing
as
that
lying
about
in
your
drawer
and
then
vanished
the
old
lady
kept
so
still
and
silent
that
the
shopkeeper
wife
was
surprised
she
went
back
to
her
and
on
a
nearer
view
a
sudden
impulse
of
pity
blended
perhaps
with
curiosity
got
the
better
of
her
the
old
lady
face
was
naturally
pale
she
looked
as
though
she
secretly
practised
austerities
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
paler
than
usual
from
recent
agitation
of
some
kind
her
was
so
arranged
as
to
almost
hide
hair
that
was
white
no
doubt
with
age
for
there
was
not
a
trace
of
powder
on
the
collar
of
her
dress
the
extreme
plainness
of
her
dress
lent
an
air
of
austerity
to
her
face
and
her
features
were
proud
and
grave
the
manners
and
habits
of
people
of
condition
were
so
different
from
those
of
other
classes
in
former
times
that
a
noble
was
easily
known
and
the
shopkeeper
wife
felt
persuaded
that
her
customer
was
a
and
that
she
had
been
about
the
court
madame
she
began
with
involuntary
respect
forgetting
that
the
title
was
proscribed
but
the
old
lady
made
no
answer
she
was
staring
fixedly
at
the
shop
windows
as
though
some
dreadful
thing
had
taken
shape
against
the
panes
the
came
back
at
that
moment
and
drew
the
lady
from
her
musings
by
holding
out
a
little
cardboard
box
wrapped
in
blue
paper
what
is
the
matter
citoyenne
he
asked
nothing
nothing
my
friends
she
answered
in
a
gentle
voice
she
looked
up
at
the
man
as
she
spoke
as
if
to
thank
him
by
a
glance
but
she
saw
the
red
cap
on
his
head
and
a
cry
broke
from
her
ah
have
betrayed
me
the
man
and
his
young
wife
replied
by
an
indignant
gesture
that
brought
the
color
to
the
old
lady
face
perhaps
she
felt
relief
perhaps
she
blushed
for
her
suspicions
forgive
me
she
said
with
a
childlike
sweetness
in
her
tones
then
drawing
a
gold
louis
from
her
pocket
she
held
it
out
to
the
that
is
the
price
agreed
upon
she
added
there
is
a
kind
of
want
that
is
felt
instinctively
by
those
who
know
want
the
man
and
his
wife
looked
at
one
another
then
at
the
elderly
woman
before
them
and
read
the
same
thoughts
in
each
other
eyes
that
bit
of
gold
was
so
plainly
the
last
her
hands
shook
a
little
as
she
held
it
out
looking
at
it
sadly
but
ungrudgingly
as
one
who
knows
the
full
extent
of
the
sacrifice
hunger
and
penury
had
carved
lines
as
easy
to
read
in
her
face
as
the
traces
of
asceticism
and
fear
there
were
vestiges
of
bygone
splendor
in
her
clothes
she
was
dressed
in
threadbare
silk
a
neat
but
mantle
and
daintily
mended
lace
in
the
rags
of
former
grandeur
in
short
the
shopkeeper
and
his
wife
drawn
two
ways
by
pity
and
began
by
lulling
their
consciences
with
words
you
seem
very
poorly
citoyenne
perhaps
madame
might
like
to
take
something
the
wife
broke
in
we
have
some
very
nice
broth
added
the
and
it
is
so
cold
continued
his
wife
perhaps
you
have
caught
a
chill
madame
on
your
way
here
but
you
can
rest
and
warm
yourself
a
bit
we
are
not
so
black
as
the
devil
cried
the
man
the
kindly
intention
in
the
words
and
tones
of
the
charitable
couple
won
the
old
lady
confidence
she
said
that
a
strange
man
had
been
following
her
and
she
was
afraid
to
go
home
alone
is
that
all
returned
he
of
the
red
bonnet
wait
for
me
citoyenne
he
handed
the
gold
coin
to
his
wife
and
then
went
out
to
put
on
his
national
guard
uniform
impelled
thereto
by
the
idea
of
making
some
adequate
return
for
the
money
an
idea
that
sometimes
slips
into
a
tradesman
head
when
he
has
been
prodigiously
overpaid
for
goods
of
no
great
value
he
took
up
his
cap
buckled
on
his
sabre
and
came
out
in
full
dress
but
his
wife
had
had
time
to
reflect
and
reflection
as
not
unfrequently
happens
closed
the
hand
that
kindly
intentions
had
opened
feeling
frightened
and
uneasy
lest
her
husband
might
be
drawn
into
something
unpleasant
she
tried
to
catch
at
the
skirt
of
his
coat
to
hold
him
back
but
he
good
soul
obeying
his
charitable
first
thought
brought
out
his
offer
to
see
the
lady
home
before
his
wife
could
stop
him
the
man
of
whom
the
citoyenne
is
afraid
is
still
prowling
about
the
shop
it
seems
she
said
sharply
i
am
afraid
so
said
the
lady
innocently
how
if
it
is
a
spy
a
plot
do
go
and
take
the
box
away
from
her
the
words
whispered
in
the
ear
cooled
his
hot
fit
of
courage
down
to
zero
oh
i
will
just
go
out
and
say
a
word
or
two
i
will
rid
you
of
him
soon
enough
he
exclaimed
as
he
bounced
out
of
the
shop
the
old
lady
meanwhile
passive
as
a
child
and
almost
dazed
sat
down
on
her
chair
again
but
the
honest
came
back
directly
a
countenance
red
enough
to
begin
with
and
further
flushed
by
the
fire
was
suddenly
blanched
such
terror
perturbed
him
that
he
reeled
as
he
walked
and
stared
about
him
like
a
drunken
man
miserable
aristocrat
do
you
want
to
have
our
heads
cut
off
he
shouted
furiously
you
just
take
to
your
heels
and
never
show
yourself
here
again
do
come
to
me
for
materials
for
your
plots
he
tried
as
he
spoke
to
take
away
the
little
box
which
she
had
slipped
into
one
of
her
pockets
but
at
the
touch
of
a
profane
hand
on
her
clothes
the
stranger
recovered
youth
and
activity
for
a
moment
preferring
to
face
the
dangers
of
the
street
with
no
protector
save
god
to
the
loss
of
the
thing
she
had
just
paid
for
she
sprang
to
the
door
flung
it
open
and
disappeared
leaving
the
husband
and
wife
dumfounded
and
quaking
with
fright
once
outside
in
the
street
she
started
away
at
a
quick
walk
but
her
strength
soon
failed
her
she
heard
the
sound
of
the
snow
crunching
under
a
heavy
step
and
knew
that
the
pitiless
spy
was
on
her
track
she
was
obliged
to
stop
he
stopped
likewise
from
sheer
terror
or
lack
of
intelligence
she
did
not
dare
to
speak
or
to
look
at
him
she
went
slowly
on
the
man
slackened
his
pace
and
fell
behind
so
that
he
could
still
keep
her
in
sight
he
might
have
been
her
very
shadow
nine
struck
as
the
silent
man
and
woman
passed
again
by
the
church
of
saint
laurent
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
calm
must
succeed
to
violent
agitation
even
in
the
weakest
soul
for
if
feeling
is
infinite
our
capacity
to
feel
is
limited
so
as
the
stranger
lady
met
with
no
harm
from
her
supposed
persecutor
she
tried
to
look
upon
him
as
an
unknown
friend
anxious
to
protect
her
she
thought
of
all
the
circumstances
in
which
the
stranger
had
appeared
and
put
them
together
as
if
to
find
some
ground
for
this
comforting
theory
and
felt
inclined
to
credit
him
with
good
intentions
rather
than
bad
forgetting
the
fright
that
he
had
given
the
she
walked
on
with
a
firmer
step
through
the
upper
end
of
the
faubourg
saint
martin
and
another
walk
brought
her
to
a
house
at
the
corner
where
the
road
to
the
barriere
de
pantin
turns
off
from
the
main
thoroughfare
even
at
this
day
the
place
is
one
of
the
least
frequented
parts
of
paris
the
north
wind
sweeps
over
the
and
belleville
and
whistles
through
the
houses
the
hovels
rather
scattered
over
an
almost
uninhabited
waste
where
the
fences
are
heaps
of
earth
and
bones
it
was
a
place
a
fitting
refuge
for
despair
and
misery
the
sight
of
it
appeared
to
make
an
impression
upon
the
relentless
pursuer
of
a
poor
creature
so
daring
as
to
walk
alone
at
night
through
the
silent
streets
he
stood
in
thought
and
seemed
by
his
attitude
to
hesitate
she
could
see
him
dimly
now
under
the
street
lamp
that
sent
a
faint
flickering
light
through
the
fog
fear
gave
her
eyes
she
saw
or
thought
she
saw
something
sinister
about
the
stranger
features
her
old
terrors
awoke
she
took
advantage
of
a
kind
of
hesitation
on
his
part
slipped
through
the
shadows
to
the
door
of
the
solitary
house
pressed
a
spring
and
vanished
swiftly
as
a
phantom
for
awhile
the
stranger
stood
motionless
gazing
up
at
the
house
it
was
in
some
sort
a
type
of
the
wretched
dwellings
in
the
suburb
a
hovel
built
of
rough
stones
daubed
over
with
a
coat
of
yellowish
stucco
and
so
riven
with
great
cracks
that
there
seemed
to
be
danger
lest
the
slightest
puff
of
wind
might
blow
it
down
the
roof
covered
with
brown
tiles
had
given
way
in
several
places
and
looked
as
though
it
might
break
down
altogether
under
the
weight
of
the
snow
the
frames
of
the
three
windows
on
each
story
were
rotten
with
damp
and
warped
by
the
sun
evidently
the
cold
must
find
its
way
inside
the
house
standing
thus
quite
by
itself
looked
like
some
old
tower
that
time
had
forgotten
to
destroy
a
faint
light
shone
from
the
attic
windows
pierced
at
irregular
distances
in
the
roof
otherwise
the
whole
building
was
in
total
darkness
meanwhile
the
old
lady
climbed
not
without
difficulty
up
the
rough
clumsily
built
staircase
with
a
rope
by
way
of
a
at
the
door
of
the
lodging
in
the
attic
she
stopped
and
tapped
mysteriously
an
old
man
brought
forward
a
chair
for
her
she
dropped
into
it
at
once
hide
hide
she
exclaimed
looking
up
at
him
seldom
as
we
leave
the
house
everything
that
we
do
is
known
and
every
step
is
watched
what
is
it
now
asked
another
elderly
woman
sitting
by
the
fire
the
man
that
has
been
prowling
about
the
house
yesterday
and
followed
me
at
those
words
all
three
dwellers
in
the
wretched
den
looked
in
each
other
faces
and
did
not
try
to
dissimulate
the
profound
dread
that
they
felt
the
old
priest
was
the
least
overcome
probably
because
he
ran
the
greatest
danger
if
a
brave
man
is
weighed
down
by
great
calamities
or
the
yoke
of
persecution
he
begins
as
it
were
by
making
the
sacrifice
of
himself
and
thereafter
every
day
of
his
life
becomes
one
more
victory
snatched
from
fate
but
from
the
way
in
which
the
women
looked
at
him
it
was
easy
to
see
that
their
intense
anxiety
was
on
his
account
why
should
our
faith
in
god
fail
us
my
sisters
he
said
in
low
but
fervent
tones
we
sang
his
praises
through
the
shrieks
of
murderers
and
their
victims
at
the
carmelites
if
it
was
his
will
that
i
should
come
alive
out
of
that
butchery
it
was
no
doubt
because
i
was
reserved
for
some
fate
which
i
am
bound
to
endure
without
murmuring
god
will
protect
his
own
he
can
do
with
them
according
to
his
will
it
is
for
you
not
for
me
that
we
must
think
no
answered
one
of
the
women
what
is
our
life
compared
to
a
priest
life
once
outside
the
abbaye
de
chelles
i
look
upon
myself
as
dead
added
the
nun
who
had
not
left
the
house
while
the
sister
that
had
just
returned
held
out
the
little
box
to
the
priest
here
are
the
wafers
but
i
can
hear
some
one
coming
up
the
stairs
at
this
the
three
began
to
listen
the
sound
ceased
do
not
be
alarmed
if
somebody
tries
to
come
in
said
the
priest
somebody
on
whom
we
could
depend
was
to
make
all
necessary
arrangements
for
crossing
the
frontier
he
is
to
come
for
the
letters
that
i
have
written
to
the
duc
de
langeais
and
the
marquis
de
beauseant
asking
them
to
find
some
way
of
taking
you
out
of
this
dreadful
country
and
away
from
the
death
or
the
misery
that
waits
for
you
here
but
are
you
not
going
to
follow
us
the
nuns
cried
under
their
breath
almost
despairingly
my
post
is
here
where
the
sufferers
are
the
priest
said
simply
and
the
women
said
no
more
but
looked
at
their
guest
in
reverent
admiration
he
turned
to
the
nun
with
the
wafers
sister
marthe
he
said
the
messenger
will
say
in
answer
to
the
word
there
is
some
one
on
the
stairs
cried
the
other
nun
opening
a
contrived
in
the
roof
this
time
it
was
easy
to
hear
amid
the
deepest
silence
a
sound
echoing
up
the
staircase
it
was
a
man
tread
on
the
steps
covered
with
dried
lumps
of
mud
with
some
difficulty
the
priest
slipped
into
a
kind
of
cupboard
and
the
nun
flung
some
clothes
over
him
you
can
shut
the
door
sister
agathe
he
said
in
a
muffled
voice
he
was
scarcely
hidden
before
three
raps
sounded
on
the
door
the
holy
women
looked
into
each
other
eyes
for
counsel
and
dared
not
say
a
single
word
they
seemed
both
to
be
about
sixty
years
of
age
they
had
lived
out
of
the
world
for
forty
years
and
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
the
life
of
the
convent
that
they
could
scarcely
imagine
any
other
to
them
as
to
plants
kept
in
a
a
change
of
air
meant
death
and
so
when
the
grating
was
broken
down
one
morning
they
knew
with
a
shudder
that
they
were
free
the
effect
produced
by
the
revolution
upon
their
simple
souls
is
easy
to
imagine
it
produced
a
temporary
imbecility
not
natural
to
them
they
could
not
bring
the
ideas
learned
in
the
convent
into
harmony
with
life
and
its
difficulties
they
could
not
even
understand
their
own
position
they
were
like
children
whom
mothers
have
always
cared
for
deserted
by
their
maternal
providence
and
as
a
child
cries
they
betook
themselves
to
prayer
now
in
the
presence
of
imminent
danger
they
were
mute
and
passive
knowing
no
defence
save
christian
resignation
the
man
at
the
door
taking
silence
for
consent
presented
himself
and
the
women
shuddered
this
was
the
prowler
that
had
been
making
inquiries
about
them
for
some
time
past
but
they
looked
at
him
with
frightened
curiosity
much
as
shy
children
stare
silently
at
a
stranger
and
neither
of
them
moved
the
newcomer
was
a
tall
burly
man
nothing
in
his
behavior
bearing
or
expression
suggested
malignity
as
following
the
example
set
by
the
nuns
he
stood
motionless
while
his
eyes
traveled
round
the
room
two
straw
mats
laid
upon
planks
did
duty
as
beds
on
the
one
table
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
brass
candlestick
several
plates
three
knives
and
a
round
loaf
a
small
fire
burned
in
the
grate
a
few
bits
of
wood
in
a
heap
in
a
corner
bore
further
witness
to
the
poverty
of
the
recluses
you
had
only
to
look
at
the
coating
of
paint
on
the
walls
to
discover
the
bad
condition
of
the
roof
and
the
ceiling
was
a
perfect
network
of
brown
stains
made
by
a
relic
saved
no
doubt
from
the
wreck
of
the
abbaye
de
chelles
stood
like
an
ornament
on
the
three
chairs
two
boxes
and
a
rickety
chest
of
drawers
completed
the
list
of
the
furniture
but
a
door
beside
the
fireplace
suggested
an
inner
room
beyond
the
brief
inventory
was
soon
made
by
the
personage
introduced
into
their
midst
under
such
terrible
auspices
it
was
with
a
compassionate
expression
that
he
turned
to
the
two
women
he
looked
benevolently
at
them
and
seemed
at
least
as
much
embarrassed
as
they
but
the
strange
silence
did
not
last
long
for
presently
the
stranger
began
to
understand
he
saw
how
inexperienced
how
helpless
mentally
speaking
the
two
poor
creatures
were
and
he
tried
to
speak
gently
i
am
far
from
coming
as
an
enemy
citoyennes
he
began
then
he
suddenly
broke
off
and
went
on
sisters
if
anything
should
happen
to
you
believe
me
i
shall
have
no
share
in
it
i
have
come
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
still
the
women
were
silent
if
i
am
annoying
you
if
if
i
am
intruding
speak
freely
and
i
will
go
but
you
must
understand
that
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
that
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
you
need
not
fear
to
make
use
of
me
i
and
i
only
perhaps
am
above
the
law
since
there
is
no
king
now
there
was
such
a
ring
of
sincerity
in
the
words
that
sister
agathe
hastily
pointed
to
a
chair
as
if
to
bid
their
guest
be
seated
sister
agathe
came
of
the
house
of
langeais
her
manner
seemed
to
indicate
that
once
she
had
been
familiar
with
brilliant
scenes
and
had
breathed
the
air
of
courts
the
stranger
seemed
half
pleased
half
distressed
when
he
understood
her
invitation
he
waited
to
sit
down
until
the
women
were
seated
you
are
giving
shelter
to
a
reverend
father
who
refused
to
take
the
oath
and
escaped
the
massacres
at
the
carmelites
by
a
miracle
sister
agathe
exclaimed
eagerly
interrupting
the
stranger
while
she
watched
him
with
curious
eyes
that
is
not
the
name
i
think
he
said
but
monsieur
sister
marthe
broke
in
quickly
we
have
no
priest
here
and
in
that
case
you
should
be
more
careful
and
on
your
guard
he
answered
gently
stretching
out
his
hand
for
a
breviary
that
lay
on
the
table
i
do
not
think
that
you
know
latin
and
he
stopped
for
at
the
sight
of
the
great
emotion
in
the
faces
of
the
two
poor
nuns
he
was
afraid
that
he
had
gone
too
far
they
were
trembling
and
the
tears
stood
in
their
eyes
do
not
fear
he
said
frankly
i
know
your
names
and
the
name
of
your
guest
three
days
ago
i
heard
of
your
distress
and
devotion
to
the
venerable
abbe
de
hush
sister
agathe
cried
in
the
simplicity
of
her
heart
as
she
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
you
see
sisters
that
if
i
had
conceived
the
horrible
idea
of
betraying
you
i
could
have
given
you
up
already
more
than
once
at
the
words
the
priest
came
out
of
his
and
stood
in
their
midst
i
can
not
believe
monsieur
that
you
can
be
one
of
our
persecutors
he
said
addressing
the
stranger
and
i
trust
you
what
do
you
want
with
me
the
priest
holy
confidence
the
nobleness
expressed
in
every
line
in
his
face
would
have
disarmed
a
murderer
for
a
moment
the
mysterious
stranger
who
had
brought
an
element
of
excitement
into
lives
of
misery
and
resignation
gazed
at
the
little
group
then
he
turned
to
the
priest
and
said
as
if
making
a
confidence
father
i
came
to
beg
you
to
celebrate
a
mass
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
of
of
an
august
personage
whose
body
will
never
rest
in
consecrated
earth
involuntarily
the
abbe
shivered
as
yet
neither
of
the
sisters
understood
of
whom
the
stranger
was
speaking
they
sat
with
their
heads
stretched
out
and
faces
turned
towards
the
speaker
curiosity
in
their
whole
attitude
the
priest
meanwhile
was
scrutinizing
the
stranger
there
was
no
mistaking
the
anxiety
in
the
man
face
the
ardent
entreaty
in
his
eyes
very
well
returned
the
abbe
come
back
at
midnight
i
shall
be
ready
to
celebrate
the
only
funeral
service
that
it
is
in
our
power
to
offer
in
expiation
of
the
crime
of
which
you
speak
a
quiver
ran
through
the
stranger
but
a
sweet
yet
sober
satisfaction
seemed
to
prevail
over
a
hidden
anguish
he
took
his
leave
respectfully
and
the
three
generous
souls
felt
his
unspoken
gratitude
two
hours
later
he
came
back
and
tapped
at
the
garret
door
mademoiselle
de
beauseant
showed
the
way
into
the
second
room
of
their
humble
lodging
everything
had
been
made
ready
the
sisters
had
moved
the
old
chest
of
drawers
between
the
two
chimneys
and
covered
its
quaint
outlines
over
with
a
splendid
altar
cloth
of
green
watered
silk
the
bare
walls
looked
all
the
barer
because
the
one
thing
that
hung
there
was
the
great
ivory
and
ebony
crucifix
which
of
necessity
attracted
the
eyes
four
slender
little
altar
candles
which
the
sisters
had
contrived
to
fasten
into
their
places
with
gave
a
faint
pale
light
almost
absorbed
by
the
walls
the
rest
of
the
room
lay
in
the
dark
but
the
dim
brightness
concentrated
upon
the
holy
things
looked
like
a
ray
from
heaven
shining
down
upon
the
unadorned
shrine
the
floor
was
reeking
with
damp
an
icy
wind
swept
in
through
the
chinks
here
and
there
in
a
roof
that
rose
sharply
on
either
side
after
the
fashion
of
attic
roofs
nothing
could
be
less
imposing
yet
perhaps
too
nothing
could
be
more
solemn
than
this
mournful
ceremony
a
silence
so
deep
that
they
could
have
heard
the
faintest
sound
of
a
voice
on
the
route
invested
the
with
a
kind
of
sombre
majesty
while
the
grandeur
of
the
service
all
the
grander
for
the
strong
contrast
with
the
poor
surroundings
produced
a
feeling
of
reverent
awe
the
sisters
kneeling
on
each
side
of
the
altar
regardless
of
the
deadly
chill
from
the
wet
brick
floor
were
engaged
in
prayer
while
the
priest
arrayed
in
pontifical
vestments
brought
out
a
golden
chalice
set
with
gems
doubtless
one
of
the
sacred
vessels
saved
from
the
pillage
of
the
abbaye
de
chelles
beside
a
ciborium
the
gift
of
royal
munificence
the
wine
and
water
for
the
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
stood
ready
in
two
glasses
such
as
could
scarcely
be
found
in
the
meanest
tavern
for
want
of
a
missal
the
priest
had
laid
his
breviary
on
the
altar
and
a
common
earthenware
plate
was
set
for
the
washing
of
hands
that
were
pure
and
undefiled
with
blood
it
was
all
so
infinitely
great
yet
so
little
yet
noble
a
mingling
of
sacred
and
profane
the
stranger
came
forward
reverently
to
kneel
between
the
two
nuns
but
the
priest
had
tied
crape
round
the
chalice
of
the
crucifix
having
no
other
way
of
marking
the
mass
as
a
funeral
service
it
was
as
if
god
himself
had
been
in
mourning
the
man
suddenly
noticed
this
and
the
sight
appeared
to
call
up
some
overwhelming
memory
for
great
drops
of
sweat
stood
out
on
his
broad
forehead
then
the
four
silent
actors
in
the
scene
looked
mysteriously
at
one
another
and
their
souls
in
emulation
seemed
to
stir
and
communicate
the
thoughts
within
them
until
all
were
melted
into
one
feeling
of
awe
and
pity
it
seemed
to
them
that
the
royal
martyr
whose
remains
had
been
consumed
with
quicklime
had
been
called
up
by
their
yearning
and
now
stood
a
shadow
in
their
midst
in
all
the
majesty
of
a
king
they
were
celebrating
an
anniversary
service
for
the
dead
whose
body
lay
elsewhere
under
the
disjointed
laths
and
tiles
four
christians
were
holding
a
funeral
service
without
a
coffin
and
putting
up
prayers
to
god
for
the
soul
of
a
king
of
france
no
devotion
could
be
purer
than
this
it
was
a
wonderful
act
of
faith
achieved
without
an
afterthought
surely
in
the
sight
of
god
it
was
like
the
cup
of
cold
water
which
counterbalances
the
loftiest
virtues
the
prayers
put
up
by
two
feeble
nuns
and
a
priest
represented
the
whole
monarchy
and
possibly
at
the
same
time
the
revolution
found
expression
in
the
stranger
for
the
remorse
in
his
face
was
so
great
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
think
that
he
was
fulfilling
the
vows
of
a
boundless
repentance
when
the
priest
came
to
the
latin
words
ad
altare
a
sudden
divine
inspiration
flashed
upon
him
he
looked
at
the
three
kneeling
figures
the
representatives
of
christian
france
and
said
instead
as
though
to
blot
out
the
poverty
of
the
garret
we
are
about
to
enter
the
sanctuary
of
god
these
words
uttered
with
thrilling
earnestness
struck
reverent
awe
into
the
nuns
and
the
stranger
under
the
vaulted
roof
of
peter
at
rome
god
would
not
have
revealed
himself
in
greater
majesty
than
here
for
the
eyes
of
the
christians
in
that
poor
refuge
so
true
is
it
that
all
intermediaries
between
god
and
the
soul
of
man
are
superfluous
and
all
the
grandeur
of
god
proceeds
from
himself
alone
the
stranger
fervor
was
sincere
one
emotion
blended
the
prayers
of
the
four
servants
of
god
and
the
king
in
a
single
supplication
the
holy
words
rang
like
the
music
of
heaven
through
the
silence
at
one
moment
tears
gathered
in
the
stranger
eyes
this
was
during
the
for
the
priest
added
a
petition
in
latin
and
his
audience
doubtless
understood
him
when
he
said
remitte
scelus
regicidis
sicut
ludovicus
eis
remisit
forgive
the
regicides
as
louis
himself
forgave
them
the
sisters
saw
two
great
tears
trace
a
channel
down
the
manly
checks
and
fall
to
the
floor
then
the
office
for
the
dead
was
recited
the
domine
salvum
fac
regem
chanted
in
an
undertone
that
went
to
the
hearts
of
the
faithful
royalists
for
they
thought
how
the
for
whom
they
were
praying
was
even
then
a
captive
in
the
hands
of
his
enemies
and
a
shudder
ran
through
the
stranger
as
he
thought
that
a
new
crime
might
be
committed
and
that
he
could
not
choose
but
take
his
part
in
it
the
service
came
to
an
end
the
priest
made
a
sign
to
the
sisters
and
they
withdrew
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
with
the
stranger
he
went
towards
him
with
a
grave
gentle
face
and
said
in
fatherly
tones
my
son
if
your
hands
are
stained
with
the
blood
of
the
royal
martyr
confide
in
me
there
is
no
sin
that
may
not
be
blotted
out
in
the
sight
of
god
by
penitence
as
sincere
and
touching
as
yours
appears
to
be
at
the
first
words
the
man
started
with
terror
in
spite
of
himself
then
he
recovered
composure
and
looked
quietly
at
the
astonished
priest
father
he
said
and
the
other
could
not
miss
the
tremor
in
his
voice
no
one
is
more
guiltless
than
i
of
the
blood
shed
i
am
bound
to
believe
you
said
the
priest
he
paused
a
moment
and
again
he
scrutinized
his
penitent
but
persisting
in
the
idea
that
the
man
before
him
was
one
of
the
members
of
the
convention
one
of
the
voters
who
betrayed
an
inviolable
and
anointed
head
to
save
their
own
he
began
again
gravely
remember
my
son
that
it
is
not
enough
to
have
taken
no
active
part
in
the
great
crime
that
fact
does
not
absolve
you
the
men
who
might
have
defended
the
king
and
left
their
swords
in
their
scabbards
will
have
a
very
heavy
account
to
render
to
the
king
of
heaven
ah
yes
he
added
with
an
eloquent
shake
of
the
head
heavy
indeed
for
by
doing
nothing
they
became
accomplices
in
the
awful
wickedness
but
do
you
think
that
an
indirect
participation
will
be
punished
the
stranger
asked
with
a
bewildered
look
there
is
the
private
soldier
commanded
to
fall
into
line
is
he
actually
responsible
the
priest
hesitated
the
stranger
was
glad
he
had
put
the
royalist
precisian
in
a
dilemma
between
the
dogma
of
passive
obedience
on
the
one
hand
for
the
upholders
of
the
monarchy
maintained
that
obedience
was
the
first
principle
of
military
law
and
the
equally
important
dogma
which
turns
respect
for
the
person
of
a
king
into
a
matter
of
religion
in
the
priest
indecision
he
was
eager
to
see
a
favorable
solution
of
the
doubts
which
seemed
to
torment
him
to
prevent
too
prolonged
reflection
on
the
part
of
the
reverend
jansenist
he
added
i
should
blush
to
offer
remuneration
of
any
kind
for
the
funeral
service
which
you
have
just
performed
for
the
repose
of
the
king
soul
and
the
relief
of
my
conscience
the
only
possible
return
for
something
of
inestimable
value
is
an
offering
likewise
beyond
price
will
you
deign
monsieur
to
take
my
gift
of
a
holy
relic
a
day
will
perhaps
come
when
you
will
understand
its
value
as
he
spoke
the
stranger
held
out
a
box
it
was
very
small
and
exceedingly
light
the
priest
took
it
mechanically
as
it
were
so
astonished
was
he
by
the
man
solemn
words
the
tones
of
his
voice
and
the
reverence
with
which
he
held
out
the
gift
the
two
men
went
back
together
into
the
first
room
the
sisters
were
waiting
for
them
this
house
that
you
are
living
in
belongs
to
mucius
scaevola
the
plasterer
on
the
first
floor
he
said
he
is
well
known
in
the
section
for
his
patriotism
but
in
reality
he
is
an
adherent
of
the
bourbons
he
used
to
be
a
huntsman
in
the
service
of
his
highness
the
prince
de
conti
and
he
owes
everything
to
him
so
long
as
you
stay
in
the
house
you
are
safer
here
than
anywhere
else
in
france
do
not
go
out
pious
souls
will
minister
to
your
necessities
and
you
can
wait
in
safety
for
better
times
next
year
on
the
of
january
he
could
not
hide
an
involuntary
shudder
as
he
spoke
next
year
if
you
are
still
in
this
dreary
refuge
i
will
come
back
again
to
celebrate
the
expiatory
mass
with
you
he
broke
off
bowed
to
the
three
who
answered
not
a
word
gave
a
last
look
at
the
garret
with
its
signs
of
poverty
and
vanished
such
an
adventure
possessed
all
the
interest
of
a
romance
in
the
lives
of
the
innocent
nuns
so
as
soon
as
the
venerable
abbe
told
them
the
story
of
the
mysterious
gift
it
was
placed
upon
the
table
and
by
the
feeble
light
of
the
tallow
dip
an
indescribable
curiosity
appeared
in
the
three
anxious
faces
mademoiselle
de
langeais
opened
the
box
and
found
a
very
fine
lawn
handkerchief
soiled
with
sweat
darker
stains
appeared
as
they
unfolded
it
that
is
blood
exclaimed
the
priest
it
is
marked
with
a
royal
crown
cried
sister
agathe
the
women
aghast
allowed
the
precious
relic
to
fall
for
their
simple
souls
the
mystery
that
hung
about
the
stranger
grew
inexplicable
as
for
the
priest
from
that
day
forth
he
did
not
even
try
to
understand
it
before
very
long
the
prisoners
knew
that
in
spite
of
the
terror
some
powerful
hand
was
extended
over
them
it
began
when
they
received
firewood
and
provisions
and
next
the
sisters
knew
that
a
woman
had
lent
counsel
to
their
protector
for
linen
was
sent
to
them
and
clothes
in
which
they
could
leave
the
house
without
causing
remark
upon
the
aristocrat
dress
that
they
had
been
forced
to
wear
after
awhile
mucius
scaevola
gave
them
two
civic
cards
and
often
tidings
necessary
for
the
priest
safety
came
to
them
in
roundabout
ways
warnings
and
advice
reached
them
so
opportunely
that
they
could
only
have
been
sent
by
some
person
in
the
possession
of
state
secrets
and
at
a
time
when
famine
threatened
paris
invisible
hands
brought
rations
of
white
bread
for
the
proscribed
women
in
the
wretched
garret
still
they
fancied
that
citizen
mucius
scaevola
was
only
the
mysterious
instrument
of
a
kindness
always
ingenious
and
no
less
intelligent
the
noble
ladies
in
the
garret
could
no
longer
doubt
that
their
protector
was
the
stranger
of
the
expiatory
mass
on
the
night
of
the
of
january
and
a
kind
of
cult
of
him
sprung
up
among
them
their
one
hope
was
in
him
they
lived
through
him
they
added
special
petitions
for
him
to
their
prayers
night
and
morning
the
pious
souls
prayed
for
his
happiness
his
prosperity
his
safety
entreating
god
to
remove
all
snares
far
from
his
path
to
deliver
him
from
his
enemies
to
grant
him
a
long
and
peaceful
life
and
with
this
daily
renewed
gratitude
as
it
may
be
called
there
blended
a
feeling
of
curiosity
which
grew
more
lively
day
by
day
they
talked
over
the
circumstances
of
his
first
sudden
appearance
their
conjectures
were
endless
the
stranger
had
conferred
one
more
benefit
upon
them
by
diverting
their
minds
again
and
again
they
said
when
he
next
came
to
see
them
as
he
promised
to
celebrate
the
sad
anniversary
of
the
death
of
louis
he
could
not
escape
their
friendship
the
night
so
impatiently
awaited
came
at
last
at
midnight
the
old
wooden
staircase
echoed
with
the
stranger
heavy
footsteps
they
had
made
the
best
of
their
room
for
his
coming
the
altar
was
ready
and
this
time
the
door
stood
open
and
the
two
sisters
were
out
at
the
stairhead
eager
to
light
the
way
mademoiselle
de
langeais
even
came
down
a
few
steps
to
meet
their
benefactor
the
sooner
come
she
said
with
a
quaver
in
the
affectionate
tones
come
in
we
are
expecting
you
he
raised
his
face
gave
her
a
dark
look
and
made
no
answer
the
sister
felt
as
if
an
icy
mantle
had
fallen
over
her
and
said
no
more
at
the
sight
of
him
the
glow
of
gratitude
and
curiosity
died
away
in
their
hearts
perhaps
he
was
not
so
cold
not
so
taciturn
not
so
stern
as
he
seemed
to
them
for
in
their
highly
wrought
mood
they
were
ready
to
pour
out
their
feeling
of
friendship
but
the
three
poor
prisoners
understood
that
he
wished
to
be
a
stranger
to
them
and
submitted
the
priest
fancied
that
he
saw
a
smile
on
the
man
lips
as
he
saw
their
preparations
for
his
visit
but
it
was
at
once
repressed
he
heard
mass
said
his
prayer
and
then
disappeared
declining
with
a
few
polite
words
mademoiselle
de
langeais
invitation
to
partake
of
the
little
collation
made
ready
for
him
after
the
thermidor
the
sisters
and
the
abbe
de
marolles
could
go
about
paris
without
the
least
danger
the
first
time
that
the
abbe
went
out
he
walked
to
a
perfumer
shop
at
the
sign
of
queen
of
kept
by
the
citizen
ragon
and
his
wife
court
perfumers
the
ragons
had
been
faithful
adherents
of
the
royalist
cause
it
was
through
their
means
that
the
vendean
leaders
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
the
princes
and
the
royalist
committee
in
paris
the
abbe
in
the
ordinary
dress
of
the
time
was
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
shop
which
stood
between
saint
roch
and
the
rue
des
frondeurs
when
he
saw
that
the
rue
saint
honore
was
filled
with
a
crowd
and
he
could
not
go
out
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
madame
ragon
nothing
she
said
it
is
only
the
tumbril
cart
and
the
executioner
going
to
the
place
louis
xv
ah
we
used
to
see
it
often
enough
last
year
but
four
days
after
the
anniversary
of
the
of
january
one
does
not
feel
sorry
to
see
the
ghastly
procession
why
not
asked
the
abbe
that
is
not
said
like
a
christian
eh
but
it
is
the
execution
of
robespierre
accomplices
they
defended
themselves
as
long
as
they
could
but
now
it
is
their
turn
to
go
where
they
sent
so
many
innocent
people
the
crowd
poured
by
like
a
flood
the
abbe
yielding
to
an
impulse
of
curiosity
looked
up
above
the
heads
and
there
in
the
tumbril
stood
the
man
who
had
heard
mass
in
the
garret
three
days
ago
who
is
it
he
asked
who
is
the
man
with
that
is
the
headsman
answered
ragon
calling
the
executioner
the
des
hautes
by
the
name
he
had
borne
under
the
monarchy
oh
my
dear
my
dear
is
dying
cried
out
old
madame
ragon
she
caught
up
a
flask
of
vinegar
and
tried
to
restore
the
old
priest
to
consciousness
he
must
have
given
me
the
handkerchief
that
the
king
used
to
wipe
his
brow
on
the
way
to
his
martyrdom
murmured
he
poor
man
there
was
a
heart
in
the
steel
blade
when
none
was
found
in
all
france
the
perfumers
thought
that
the
poor
abbe
was
raving
