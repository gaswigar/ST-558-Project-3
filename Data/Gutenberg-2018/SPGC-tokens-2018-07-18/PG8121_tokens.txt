ghosts
by
henrik
ibsen
translated
with
an
introduction
by
william
archer
introduction
the
winter
of
ibsen
spent
in
munich
and
the
greater
part
of
the
summer
of
at
berchtesgaden
november
saw
him
back
in
rome
and
he
passed
the
summer
of
at
sorrento
there
fourteen
years
earlier
he
had
written
the
last
acts
of
there
he
now
wrote
or
at
any
rate
completed
it
was
published
in
december
after
he
had
returned
to
rome
on
december
he
wrote
to
ludwig
passarge
one
of
his
german
translators
my
new
play
has
now
appeared
and
has
occasioned
a
terrible
uproar
in
the
scandinavian
press
every
day
i
receive
letters
and
newspaper
articles
decrying
or
praising
it
i
consider
it
utterly
impossible
that
any
german
theatre
will
accept
the
play
at
present
i
hardly
believe
that
they
will
dare
to
play
it
in
the
scandinavian
countries
for
some
time
to
come
how
rightly
he
judged
we
shall
see
anon
in
the
newspapers
there
was
far
more
obloquy
than
praise
two
men
however
stood
by
him
from
the
first
björnson
from
whom
he
had
been
practically
estranged
ever
since
league
of
and
georg
brandes
the
latter
published
an
article
in
which
he
declared
i
quote
from
memory
that
the
play
might
or
might
not
be
ibsen
greatest
work
but
that
it
was
certainly
his
noblest
deed
it
was
doubtless
in
acknowledgment
of
this
article
that
ibsen
wrote
to
brandes
on
january
yesterday
i
had
the
great
pleasure
of
receiving
your
brilliantly
clear
and
so
warmly
appreciative
review
of
all
who
read
your
article
must
it
seems
to
me
have
their
eyes
opened
to
what
i
meant
by
my
new
book
assuming
that
is
that
they
have
any
to
see
for
i
can
not
get
rid
of
the
impression
that
a
very
large
number
of
the
false
interpretations
which
have
appeared
in
the
newspapers
are
the
work
of
people
who
know
better
in
norway
however
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
the
stultification
has
in
most
cases
been
unintentional
and
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
in
that
country
a
great
many
of
the
critics
are
theologians
more
or
less
disguised
and
these
gentlemen
are
as
a
rule
quite
unable
to
write
rationally
about
creative
literature
that
enfeeblement
of
judgment
which
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
average
man
is
an
inevitable
consequence
of
prolonged
occupation
with
theological
studies
betrays
itself
more
especially
in
the
judging
of
human
character
human
actions
and
human
motives
practical
business
judgment
on
the
other
hand
does
not
suffer
so
much
from
studies
of
this
order
therefore
the
reverend
gentlemen
are
very
often
excellent
members
of
local
boards
but
they
are
unquestionably
our
worst
critics
this
passage
is
interesting
as
showing
clearly
the
point
of
view
from
which
ibsen
conceived
the
character
of
manders
in
the
next
paragraph
of
the
same
letter
he
discusses
the
attitude
of
the
liberal
press
but
as
the
paragraph
contains
the
germ
of
enemy
of
the
it
may
most
fittingly
be
quoted
in
the
introduction
to
that
play
three
days
later
january
ibsen
wrote
to
schandorph
the
danish
novelist
i
was
quite
prepared
for
the
hubbub
if
certain
of
our
scandinavian
reviewers
have
no
talent
for
anything
else
they
have
an
unquestionable
talent
for
thoroughly
misunderstanding
and
misinterpreting
those
authors
whose
books
they
undertake
to
judge
they
endeavour
to
make
me
responsible
for
the
opinions
which
certain
of
the
personages
of
my
drama
express
and
yet
there
is
not
in
the
whole
book
a
single
opinion
a
single
utterance
which
can
be
laid
to
the
account
of
the
author
i
took
good
care
to
avoid
this
the
very
method
the
order
of
technique
which
imposes
its
form
upon
the
play
forbids
the
author
to
appear
in
the
speeches
of
his
characters
my
object
was
to
make
the
reader
feel
that
he
was
going
through
a
piece
of
real
experience
and
nothing
could
more
effectually
prevent
such
an
impression
than
the
intrusion
of
the
author
private
opinions
into
the
dialogue
do
they
imagine
at
home
that
i
am
so
inexpert
in
the
theory
of
drama
as
not
to
know
this
of
course
i
know
it
and
act
accordingly
in
no
other
play
that
i
have
written
is
the
author
so
external
to
the
action
so
entirely
absent
from
it
as
in
this
last
one
they
say
he
continued
that
the
book
preaches
nihilism
not
at
all
it
is
not
concerned
to
preach
anything
whatsoever
it
merely
points
to
the
ferment
of
nihilism
going
on
under
the
surface
at
home
as
elsewhere
a
pastor
manders
will
always
goad
one
or
other
alving
to
revolt
and
just
because
she
is
a
woman
she
will
when
once
she
has
begun
go
to
the
utmost
extremes
towards
the
end
of
january
ibsen
wrote
from
rome
to
olaf
skavlan
these
last
weeks
have
brought
me
a
wealth
of
experiences
lessons
and
discoveries
i
of
course
foresaw
that
my
new
play
would
call
forth
a
howl
from
the
camp
of
the
stagnationists
and
for
this
i
care
no
more
than
for
the
barking
of
a
pack
of
chained
dogs
but
the
pusillanimity
which
i
have
observed
among
the
liberals
has
given
me
cause
for
reflection
the
very
day
after
my
play
was
published
the
rushed
out
a
article
evidently
designed
to
purge
itself
of
all
suspicion
of
complicity
in
my
work
this
was
entirely
unnecessary
i
myself
am
responsible
for
what
i
write
i
and
no
one
else
i
can
not
possibly
embarrass
any
party
for
to
no
party
do
i
belong
i
stand
like
a
solitary
at
the
outposts
and
fight
for
my
own
hand
the
only
man
in
norway
who
has
stood
up
freely
frankly
and
courageously
for
me
is
björnson
it
is
just
like
him
he
has
in
truth
a
great
kingly
soul
and
i
shall
never
forget
his
action
in
this
matter
one
more
quotation
completes
the
history
of
these
stirring
january
days
as
written
by
ibsen
himself
it
occurs
in
a
letter
to
a
danish
journalist
otto
borchsenius
it
may
well
be
the
poet
writes
that
the
play
is
in
several
respects
rather
daring
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
time
had
come
for
moving
some
and
this
was
an
undertaking
for
which
a
man
of
the
older
generation
like
myself
was
better
fitted
than
the
many
younger
authors
who
might
desire
to
do
something
of
the
kind
i
was
prepared
for
a
storm
but
such
storms
one
must
not
shrink
from
encountering
that
would
be
cowardice
it
happened
that
just
in
these
days
the
present
writer
had
frequent
opportunities
of
conversing
with
ibsen
and
of
hearing
from
his
own
lips
almost
all
the
views
expressed
in
the
above
extracts
he
was
especially
emphatic
i
remember
in
protesting
against
the
notion
that
the
opinions
expressed
by
alving
or
oswald
were
to
be
attributed
to
himself
he
insisted
on
the
contrary
that
alving
views
were
merely
typical
of
the
moral
chaos
inevitably
produced
by
from
the
narrow
conventionalism
represented
by
manders
with
one
consent
the
leading
theatres
of
the
three
scandinavian
capitals
declined
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
play
it
was
more
than
eighteen
months
old
before
it
found
its
way
to
the
stage
at
all
in
august
it
was
acted
for
the
first
time
at
helsingborg
sweden
by
a
travelling
company
under
the
direction
of
an
eminent
swedish
actor
august
lindberg
who
himself
played
oswald
he
took
it
on
tour
round
the
principal
cities
of
scandinavia
playing
it
among
the
rest
at
a
minor
theatre
in
christiania
it
happened
that
the
boards
of
the
christiania
theatre
were
at
the
same
time
occupied
by
a
french
farce
and
public
demonstrations
of
protest
were
made
against
the
managerial
policy
which
gave
de
the
preference
over
gradually
the
prejudice
against
the
play
broke
down
already
in
the
autumn
of
it
was
produced
at
the
royal
dramatiska
theatre
in
stockholm
when
the
new
national
theatre
was
opened
in
christiania
in
found
an
early
place
in
its
repertory
and
even
the
royal
theatre
in
copenhagen
has
since
opened
its
doors
to
the
tragedy
not
until
april
was
acted
in
germany
and
then
only
at
a
private
performance
at
the
stadttheater
augsburg
the
poet
himself
being
present
in
the
following
winter
it
was
acted
at
the
famous
court
theatre
at
meiningen
again
in
the
presence
of
the
poet
the
first
private
performance
in
berlin
took
place
on
january
at
the
residenz
theater
and
when
the
freie
bühne
founded
on
the
model
of
the
paris
theatre
libre
began
its
operations
two
years
later
september
was
the
first
play
that
it
produced
the
freie
bühne
gave
the
initial
impulse
to
the
whole
modern
movement
which
has
given
germany
a
new
dramatic
literature
and
the
leaders
of
the
movement
whether
authors
or
critics
were
one
and
all
ardent
disciples
of
ibsen
who
regarded
as
his
typical
masterpiece
in
germany
then
the
play
certainly
did
in
ibsen
own
words
move
some
the
prussian
censorship
presently
withdrew
its
veto
and
on
november
the
two
leading
literary
theatres
of
berlin
the
deutsches
theater
and
the
lessing
theater
gave
simultaneous
performances
of
the
tragedy
everywhere
in
germany
and
austria
it
is
now
freely
performed
but
it
is
naturally
one
of
the
least
popular
of
ibsen
plays
it
was
with
that
ibsen
made
his
first
appearance
on
the
french
stage
the
play
was
produced
by
the
théâtre
libre
at
the
théâtre
des
on
may
here
again
it
became
the
watchword
of
the
new
school
of
authors
and
critics
and
aroused
a
good
deal
of
opposition
among
the
old
school
but
the
most
hostile
french
criticisms
were
moderation
itself
compared
with
the
torrents
of
abuse
which
were
poured
upon
by
the
journalists
of
london
when
on
march
the
independent
theatre
under
the
direction
of
grein
gave
a
private
performance
of
the
play
at
the
royalty
theatre
soho
i
have
elsewhere
note
see
the
mausoleum
of
ibsen
august
see
also
bernard
shaw
of
and
my
introduction
to
ghosts
in
the
edition
placed
upon
record
some
of
the
amazing
feats
of
vituperation
achieved
of
the
critics
and
will
not
here
recall
them
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
if
the
play
had
been
a
tenth
part
as
nauseous
as
the
epithets
hurled
at
it
and
its
author
the
censor
veto
would
have
been
amply
justified
that
veto
is
still
in
force
england
enjoys
the
proud
distinction
of
being
the
one
country
in
the
world
where
may
not
be
publicly
acted
in
the
united
states
the
first
performance
of
the
play
in
english
took
place
at
the
berkeley
lyceum
new
york
city
on
january
the
production
was
described
by
howells
as
a
great
theatrical
event
the
very
greatest
i
have
ever
known
other
leading
men
of
letters
were
equally
impressed
by
it
five
years
later
a
second
production
took
place
at
the
carnegie
lyceum
and
an
adventurous
manager
has
even
taken
the
play
on
tour
in
the
united
states
the
italian
version
of
the
tragedy
has
ever
since
taken
a
prominent
place
in
the
repertory
of
the
great
actors
zaccone
and
novelli
who
have
acted
it
not
only
throughout
italy
but
in
austria
germany
russia
spain
and
south
america
in
an
interview
published
immediately
after
ibsen
death
björnstjerne
björnson
questioned
as
to
what
he
held
to
be
his
greatest
work
replied
without
a
moment
hesitation
this
dictum
can
scarcely
i
think
be
accepted
without
some
qualification
even
confining
our
attention
to
the
modern
plays
and
leaving
out
of
comparison
and
we
can
scarcely
call
ibsen
richest
or
most
human
play
and
certainly
not
his
profoundest
or
most
poetical
if
some
omnipotent
censorship
decreed
the
annihilation
of
all
his
works
save
one
few
people
i
imagine
would
vote
that
that
one
should
be
even
if
half
a
dozen
works
were
to
be
saved
from
the
wreck
i
doubt
whether
i
for
my
part
would
include
in
the
list
it
is
in
my
judgment
a
little
bare
hard
austere
it
is
the
first
work
in
which
ibsen
applies
his
new
technical
method
evolved
as
i
have
suggested
during
the
composition
of
doll
and
he
applies
it
with
something
of
fanaticism
he
is
under
the
sway
of
a
prosaic
ideal
confessed
in
the
phrase
my
object
was
to
make
the
reader
feel
that
he
was
going
through
a
piece
of
real
experience
and
he
is
putting
some
constraint
upon
the
poet
within
him
the
action
moves
a
little
stiffly
and
all
in
one
rhythm
it
lacks
variety
and
suppleness
moreover
the
play
affords
some
slight
excuse
for
the
criticism
which
persists
in
regarding
ibsen
as
a
preacher
rather
than
as
a
creator
an
author
who
cares
more
for
ideas
and
doctrines
than
for
human
beings
though
alving
engstrand
and
regina
are
rounded
and
breathing
characters
it
can
not
be
denied
that
manders
strikes
one
as
a
clerical
type
rather
than
an
individual
while
even
oswald
might
not
quite
unfairly
be
described
as
simply
and
solely
his
father
son
an
in
heredity
we
can
not
be
said
to
know
him
individually
and
intimately
as
we
know
helmer
or
stockmann
hialmar
ekdal
or
gregors
werle
then
again
there
are
one
or
two
curious
flaws
in
the
play
the
question
whether
oswald
case
is
one
which
actually
presents
itself
in
the
medical
books
seems
to
me
of
very
trifling
moment
it
is
typically
true
even
if
it
be
not
true
in
detail
the
suddenness
of
the
catastrophe
may
possibly
be
exaggerated
its
premonitions
and
even
its
essential
nature
may
be
misdescribed
on
the
other
hand
i
conceive
it
probable
that
the
poet
had
documents
to
found
upon
which
may
be
unknown
to
his
critics
i
have
never
taken
any
pains
to
satisfy
myself
upon
the
point
which
seems
to
me
quite
immaterial
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
of
a
captain
alving
may
and
often
does
entail
upon
posterity
consequences
quite
as
tragic
as
those
which
ensue
in
oswald
case
and
far
more
that
being
so
the
artistic
justification
of
the
presentment
of
the
case
is
certainly
not
dependent
on
its
absolute
scientific
accuracy
the
flaws
above
alluded
to
are
of
another
nature
one
of
them
is
the
prominence
given
to
the
fact
that
the
asylum
is
uninsured
no
doubt
there
is
some
symbolical
purport
in
the
circumstance
but
i
can
not
think
that
it
is
either
sufficiently
clear
or
sufficiently
important
to
justify
the
emphasis
thrown
upon
it
at
the
end
of
the
second
act
another
dubious
point
is
oswald
argument
in
the
first
act
as
to
the
expensiveness
of
marriage
as
compared
with
free
union
since
the
parties
to
free
union
as
he
describes
it
accept
all
the
responsibilities
of
marriage
and
only
pretermit
the
ceremony
the
difference
of
expense
one
would
suppose
must
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
actual
marriage
fee
i
have
never
seen
this
remark
of
adequately
explained
either
as
a
matter
of
economic
fact
or
as
a
trait
of
character
another
blemish
of
somewhat
greater
moment
is
the
inconceivable
facility
with
which
in
the
third
act
manders
suffers
himself
to
be
victimised
by
engstrand
all
these
little
things
taken
together
detract
as
it
seems
to
me
from
the
artistic
completeness
of
the
play
and
impair
its
claim
to
rank
as
the
poet
masterpiece
even
in
prose
drama
his
greatest
and
most
consummate
achievements
were
yet
to
come
must
we
then
wholly
dissent
from
björnson
judgment
i
think
not
in
a
historical
if
not
in
an
aesthetic
sense
may
well
rank
as
ibsen
greatest
work
it
was
the
play
which
first
gave
the
full
measure
of
his
technical
and
spiritual
originality
and
daring
it
has
done
far
more
than
any
other
of
his
plays
to
move
it
has
advanced
the
frontiers
of
dramatic
art
and
implanted
new
ideals
both
technical
and
intellectual
in
the
minds
of
a
whole
generation
of
playwrights
it
ranks
with
and
dame
aux
among
the
plays
of
the
nineteenth
century
while
in
point
of
essential
originality
it
towers
above
them
we
can
not
i
think
get
nearer
to
the
truth
than
georg
brandes
did
in
the
phrase
from
his
first
notice
of
the
play
describing
it
as
not
perhaps
the
poet
greatest
work

certainly
his
noblest
deed

another
essay
brandes
has
pointed
to
it
with
equal
justice
as
marking
ibsen
final
breach
with
his
early

almost
say
his
hereditary
romanticism
he
here
becomes
at

the
most
modern
of
the
moderns
this

convinced

the

bit
on

soon
tormented
her
into
her
grave
engstrand
with
a
twist
of
his
shoulders

to
have
the
blame
for
everything

aloud

a
short
silence

any
nonsense
like
that
with
me
why
do
you
want
me

well
let
me
tell

been
thinking
of
setting
up
in
a
new
line
of
business
regina
contemptuously
you
tried
that
often
enough
and
much
good
you
done
with
it
engstrand
yes
but
this
time
you
shall
see
regina
devil
take
me
regina
stamps
stop
your
swearing
engstrand
hush
hush
you
right
enough
there
my
girl
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
just
this
i
laid
by
a
very
tidy
pile
from
this
orphanage
job
regina
have
you
that
a
good
thing
for
you
engstrand
what
can
a
man
spend
his
on
here
in
this
country
hole
regina
well
what
then
engstrand
why
you
see
i
thought
of
putting
the
money
into
some
paying
speculation
i
thought
of
a
sort
of
a
sailor
tavern
regina
pah
engstrand
a
regular
affair
of
course
not
any
sort
of
for
common
sailors
no
damn
it
it
would
be
for
captains
and
mates
and
and
regular
swells
you
know
regina
and
i
was
to
engstrand
you
were
to
help
to
be
sure
only
for
the
look
of
the
thing
you
understand
devil
a
bit
of
hard
work
shall
you
have
my
girl
you
shall
do
exactly
what
you
like
regina
oh
indeed
engstrand
but
there
must
be
a
petticoat
in
the
house
that
as
clear
as
daylight
for
i
want
to
have
it
a
bit
lively
like
in
the
evenings
with
singing
and
dancing
and
so
on
you
must
remember
they
weary
wanderers
on
the
ocean
of
life
nearer
now
do
be
a
fool
and
stand
in
your
own
light
regina
what
to
become
of
you
out
here
your
mistress
has
given
you
a
lot
of
learning
but
what
good
is
that
to
you
you
to
look
after
the
children
at
the
new
orphanage
i
hear
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
for
you
eh
are
you
so
dead
set
on
wearing
your
life
out
for
a
pack
of
dirty
brats
regina
no
if
things
go
as
i
want
them
to
well
there
no
saying
there
no
saying
engstrand
what
do
you
mean
by
there
no
saying
regina
never
you
how
much
money
have
you
saved
engstrand
what
with
one
thing
and
another
a
matter
of
seven
or
eight
hundred
crowns
a
krone
is
equal
to
one
shilling
and
regina
that
not
so
bad
engstrand
it
enough
to
make
a
start
with
my
girl
regina
are
you
thinking
of
giving
me
any
engstrand
no
i
blest
if
i
am
regina
not
even
of
sending
me
a
scrap
of
stuff
for
a
new
dress
engstrand
come
to
town
with
me
my
lass
and
you
soon
get
dresses
enough
regina
pooh
i
can
do
that
on
my
own
account
if
i
want
to
engstrand
no
a
father
guiding
hand
is
what
you
want
regina
now
i
got
my
eye
on
a
capital
house

be
a
sort
of
a
sailors
home

will
not
live
with
you
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
do

cards

a
fine
figure
of
a
girl
as
grown
in
the
last
year
or

engstrand

same

englishman

with
the
yacht
he

man
to
tell
you
what
a
child
owes
its
father
for
i
am
your
father
all
the
same
you
know
i
can
prove
it
from
the
church
register
he
goes
out
through
the
second
door
to
the
right
which
regina
has
opened
and
closes
again
after
him
regina
glances
hastily
at
herself
in
the
mirror
dusts
herself
with
her
pocket
handkerchief
and
settles
her
necktie
then
she
busies
herself
with
the
flowers
pastor
manders
wearing
an
overcoat
carrying
an
umbrella
and
with
a
small
on
a
strap
over
his
shoulder
comes
through
the
garden
door
into
the
conservatory
manders
miss
engstrand
regina
turning
round
surprised
and
pleased
no
really
good
morning
pastor
manders
is
the
steamer
in
already
manders
it
is
just
in
enters
the
terrible
weather
we
have
been
having
lately
regina
follows
him
it
such
blessed
weather
for
the
country
sir
manders
no
doubt
you
are
quite
right
we
townspeople
give
too
little
thought
to
that
he
begins
to
take
off
his
overcoat
regina
oh
may
i
help
you
there
why
how
wet
it
is
i
just
hang
it
up
in
the
hall
and
your
umbrella
too
i
open
it
and
let
it
dry
she
goes
out
with
the
things
through
the
second
door
on
the
right
pastor
manders
takes
off
his
travelling
bag
and
lays
it
and
his
hat
on
a
chair
meanwhile
regina
comes
in
again
manders
ah
it
a
comfort
to
get
safe
under
cover
i
hope
everything
is
going
on
well
here
regina
yes
thank
you
sir
manders
you
have
your
hands
full
i
suppose
in
preparation
for
regina
yes
there
plenty
to
do
of
course
manders
and
alving
is
at
home
i
trust
regina
oh
dear
yes
she
just
upstairs
looking
after
the
young
master
chocolate
manders
yes
i
heard
down
at
the
pier
that
oswald
had
arrived
regina
yes
he
came
the
day
before
yesterday
we
did
expect
him
before
manders
quite
strong
and
well
i
hope
regina
yes
thank
you
quite
but
dreadfully
tired
with
the
journey
he
has
made
one
rush
right
through
from
paris
the
whole
way
in
one
train
i
believe
he
sleeping
a
little
now
i
think
so
perhaps
we
better
talk
a
little
quietly
manders
sh
as
quietly
as
you
please
regina
arranging
an
beside
the
table
now
do
sit
down
pastor
manders
and
make
yourself
comfortable
he
sits
down
she
places
a
footstool
under
his
feet
there
are
you
comfortable
now
sir
manders
thanks
thanks
extremely
so
looks
at
her
do
you
know
miss
engstrand
i
positively
believe
you
have
grown
since
i
last
saw
you
regina
do
you
think
so
sir
alving
says
i
filled
out
too
manders
filled
out
well
perhaps
a
little
just
enough
short
pause
regina
shall
i
tell
alving
you
are
here
manders
thanks
thanks
there
is
no
hurry
my
dear
regina
my
good
girl
tell
me
how
is
your
father
getting
on
out
here
regina
oh
thank
you
sir
he
getting
on
well
enough
manders
he
called
upon
me
last
time
he
was
in
town
regina
did
he
indeed
he
always
so
glad
of
a
chance
of
talking
to
you
sir
manders
and
you
often
look
in
upon
him
at
his
work
i
daresay
regina
i
oh
of
course
when
i
have
time
i
manders
your
father
is
not
a
man
of
strong
character
miss
engstrand
he
stands
terribly
in
need
of
a
guiding
hand
regina
oh
yes
i
daresay
he
does
manders
he
requires
some
one
near
him
whom
he
cares
for
and
whose
judgment
he
respects
he
frankly
admitted
as
much
when
he
last
came
to
see
me
regina
yes
he
mentioned
something
of
the
sort
to
me
but
i
do
know
whether
alving
can
spare
me
especially
now
that
we
got
the
new
orphanage
to
attend
to
and
then
i
should
be
so
sorry
to
leave
alving
she
has
always
been
so
kind
to
me
manders
but
a
daughter
duty
my
good
girl
of
course
we
should
first
have
to
get
your
mistress
consent
regina
but
i
do
know
whether
it
would
be
quite
proper
for
me
at
my
age
to
keep
house
for
a
single
man
manders
what
my
dear
miss
engstrand
when
the
man
is
your
own
father
regina
yes
that
may
be
but
all
the
same
now
if
it
were
in
a
thoroughly
nice
house
and
with
a
real
gentleman
manders
why
my
dear
regina
one
i
could
love
and
respect
and
be
a
daughter
to
manders
yes
but
my
dear
good
child
regina
then
i
should
be
glad
to
go
to
town
it
very
lonely
out
here
you
know
yourself
sir
what
it
is
to
be
alone
in
the
world
and
i
can
assure
you
i
both
quick
and
willing
do
you
know
of
any
such
place
for
me
sir
manders
i
no
certainly
not
regina
but
dear
dear
sir
do
remember
me
if
manders
rising
yes
yes
certainly
miss
engstrand
regina
for
if
i
manders
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
your
mistress
i
am
here
regina
i
will
at
once
sir
she
goes
out
to
the
left
manders
paces
the
room
two
or
three
times
stands
a
moment
in
the
background
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
looks
out
over
the
garden
then
he
returns
to
the
table
takes
up
a
book
and
looks
at
the
starts
and
looks
at
several
books
ha
indeed
alving
enters
by
the
door
on
the
left
she
is
followed
by
regina
who
immediately
goes
out
by
the
first
door
on
the
right
alving
holds
out
her
hand
welcome
my
dear
pastor
manders
how
do
you
do
alving
here
i
am
as
i
promised
alving
always
punctual
to
the
minute
manders
you
may
believe
it
was
not
so
easy
for
me
to
get
away
with
all
the
boards
and
committees
i
belong
to
alving
that
makes
it
all
the
kinder
of
you
to
come
so
early
now
we
can
get
through
our
business
before
dinner
but
where
is
your
portmanteau
manders
quickly
i
left
it
down
at
the
inn
i
shall
sleep
there
alving
suppressing
a
smile
are
you
really
not
to
be
persuaded
even
now
to
pass
the
night
under
my
roof
manders
no
no
alving
many
thanks
i
shall
stay
at
the
inn
as
usual
it
is
so
conveniently
near
the
alving
well
you
must
have
your
own
way
but
i
really
should
have
thought
we
two
old
people
manders
now
you
are
making
fun
of
me
ah
you
naturally
in
great
spirits
what
with
festival
and
oswald
return
alving
yes
you
can
think
what
a
delight
it
is
to
me
it
more
than
two
years
since
he
was
home
last
and
now
he
has
promised
to
stay
with
me
all
the
winter
manders
has
he
really
that
is
very
nice
and
dutiful
of
him
for
i
can
well
believe
that
life
in
rome
and
paris
has
very
different
attractions
from
any
we
can
offer
here
alving
ah
but
here
he
has
his
mother
you
see
my
own
darling
boy
he
has
forgotten
his
old
mother
manders
it
would
be
grievous
indeed
if
absence
and
absorption
in
art
and
that
sort
of
thing
were
to
blunt
his
natural
feelings
alving
yes
you
may
well
say
so
but
there
nothing
of
that
sort
to
fear
with
him
i
quite
curious
to
see
whether
you
know
him
again
he
be
down
presently
he
upstairs
just
now
resting
a
little
on
the
sofa
but
do
sit
down
my
dear
pastor
manders
thank
you
are
you
quite
at
liberty
alving
certainly
she
sits
by
the
table
manders
very
well
then
let
me
show
you
he
goes
to
the
chair
where
his
lies
takes
out
a
packet
of
papers
sits
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
tries
to
find
a
clear
space
for
the
papers
now
to
begin
with
here
is
breaking
off
tell
me
alving
how
do
these
books
come
to
be
here
alving
these
books
they
are
books
i
am
reading
manders
do
you
read
this
sort
of
literature
alving
certainly
i
do
manders
do
you
feel
better
or
happier
for
such
reading
alving
i
feel
so
to
speak
more
secure
manders
that
is
strange
how
do
you
mean
alving
well
i
seem
to
find
explanation
and
confirmation
of
all
sorts
of
things
i
myself
have
been
thinking
for
that
is
the
wonderful
part
of
it
pastor
manders
there
is
really
nothing
new
in
these
books
nothing
but
what
most
people
think
and
believe
only
most
people
either
do
formulate
it
to
themselves
or
else
keep
quiet
about
it
manders
great
heavens
do
you
really
believe
that
most
people
alving
i
do
indeed
manders
but
surely
not
in
this
country
not
here
among
us
alving
yes
certainly
here
as
elsewhere
manders
well
i
really
must
say
alving
for
the
rest
what
do
you
object
to
in
these
books
manders
object
to
in
them
you
surely
do
not
suppose
that
i
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
study
such
publications
as
these
alving
that
is
to
say
you
know
nothing
of
what
you
are
condemning
manders
i
have
read
enough
about
these
writings
to
disapprove
of
them
alving
yes
but
your
own
judgment
manders
my
dear
alving
there
are
many
occasions
in
life
when
one
must
rely
upon
others
things
are
so
ordered
in
this
world
and
it
is
well
that
they
are
otherwise
what
would
become
of
society
alving
well
well
i
daresay
you
right
there
manders
besides
i
of
course
do
not
deny
that
there
may
be
much
that
is
attractive
in
such
books
nor
can
i
blame
you
for
wishing
to
keep
up
with
the
intellectual
movements
that
are
said
to
be
going
on
in
the
great
you
have
let
your
son
pass
so
much
of
his
life
but
alving
but
manders
lowering
his
voice
but
one
should
not
talk
about
it
alving
one
is
certainly
not
bound
to
account
to
everybody
for
what
one
reads
and
thinks
within
one
own
four
walls
alving
of
course
not
i
quite
agree
with
you
manders
only
think
now
how
you
are
bound
to
consider
the
interests
of
this
orphanage
which
you
decided
on
founding
at
a
time
when
if
i
understand
you
rightly
you
thought
very
differently
on
spiritual
matters
alving
oh
yes
i
quite
admit
that
but
it
was
about
the
orphanage
manders
it
was
about
the
orphanage
we
were
to
speak
yes
all
i
say
is
prudence
my
dear
lady
and
now
let
us
get
to
business
opens
the
packet
and
takes
out
a
number
of
papers
do
you
see
these
alving
the
documents
manders
all
and
in
perfect
order
i
can
tell
you
it
was
hard
work
to
get
them
in
time
i
had
to
put
on
strong
pressure
the
authorities
are
almost
morbidly
scrupulous
when
there
is
any
decisive
step
to
be
taken
but
here
they
are
at
last
looks
through
the
bundle
see
here
is
the
formal
deed
of
gift
of
the
parcel
of
ground
known
as
solvik
in
the
manor
of
rosenvold
with
all
the
newly
constructed
buildings
schoolrooms
master
house
and
chapel
and
here
is
the
legal
fiat
for
the
endowment
and
for
the
of
the
institution
will
you
look
at
them
reads
for
the
children
home
to
be
known
as
foundation
alving
looks
long
at
the
paper
so
there
it
is
manders
i
have
chosen
the
designation
captain
rather
than
chamberlain
captain
looks
less
pretentious
alving
oh
yes
just
as
you
think
best
manders
and
here
you
have
the
bank
account
of
the
capital
lying
at
interest
to
cover
the
current
expenses
of
the
orphanage
alving
thank
you
but
please
keep
it
it
will
be
more
convenient
manders
with
pleasure
i
think
we
will
leave
the
money
in
the
bank
for
the
present
the
interest
is
certainly
not
what
we
could
wish
four
per
cent
and
six
months
notice
of
withdrawal
if
a
good
mortgage
could
be
found
later
on
of
course
it
must
be
a
first
mortgage
and
an
unimpeachable
security
then
we
could
consider
the
matter
alving
certainly
my
dear
pastor
manders
you
are
the
best
judge
in
these
things
manders
i
will
keep
my
eyes
open
at
any
but
now
there
is
one
thing
more
which
i
have
several
times
been
intending
to
ask
you
alving
and
what
is
that
manders
shall
the
orphanage
buildings
be
insured
or
not
alving
of
course
they
must
be
insured
manders
well
wait
a
moment
alving
let
us
look
into
the
matter
a
little
more
closely
alving
i
have
everything
insured
buildings
and
movables
and
stock
and
crops
manders
of
course
you
have
on
your
own
estate
and
so
have
i
of
course
but
here
you
see
it
is
quite
another
matter
the
orphanage
is
to
be
consecrated
as
it
were
to
a
higher
purpose
alving
yes
but
that
no
reason
manders
for
my
own
part
i
should
certainly
not
see
the
smallest
impropriety
in
guarding
against
all
contingencies
alving
no
i
should
think
not
manders
but
what
is
the
general
feeling
in
the
neighbourhood
you
of
course
know
better
than
alving
well
the
general
feeling
manders
is
there
any
considerable
number
of
people
really
responsible
people
who
might
be
scandalised
alving
what
do
you
mean
by
really
responsible
people
manders
well
i
mean
people
in
such
independent
and
influential
positions
that
one
can
not
help
attaching
some
weight
to
their
opinions
alving
there
are
several
people
of
that
sort
here
who
would
very
likely
be
shocked
if
manders
there
you
see
in
town
we
have
many
such
people
think
of
all
my
colleague
adherents
people
would
be
only
too
ready
to
interpret
our
action
as
a
sign
that
neither
you
nor
i
had
the
right
faith
in
a
higher
providence
alving
but
for
your
own
part
my
dear
pastor
you
can
at
least
tell
yourself
that
manders
yes
i
know
i
know
my
conscience
would
be
quite
easy
that
is
true
enough
but
nevertheless
we
should
not
escape
grave
misinterpretation
and
that
might
very
likely
react
unfavourably
upon
the
orphanage
alving
well
in
that
case
manders
nor
can
i
entirely
lose
sight
of
the
difficult
i
may
even
say
painful
position
in
which
might
perhaps
be
placed
in
the
leading
circles
of
the
town
people
take
a
lively
interest
in
this
orphanage
it
is
of
course
founded
partly
for
the
benefit
of
the
town
as
well
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
it
will
to
a
considerable
extent
result
in
lightening
our
poor
rates
now
as
i
have
been
your
adviser
and
have
had
the
business
arrangements
in
my
hands
i
can
not
but
fear
that
i
may
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
fanaticism
alving
oh
you
must
run
the
risk
of
that
manders
to
say
nothing
of
the
attacks
that
would
assuredly
be
made
upon
me
in
certain
papers
and
periodicals
which
alving
enough
my
dear
pastor
manders
that
consideration
is
quite
decisive
manders
then
you
do
not
wish
the
orphanage
to
be
insured
alving
no
we
will
let
it
alone
manders
leaning
back
in
his
chair
but
if
now
a
disaster
were
to
happen
one
can
never
tell
should
you
be
able
to
make
good
the
damage
alving
no
i
tell
you
plainly
i
should
do
nothing
of
the
kind
manders
then
i
must
tell
you
alving
we
are
taking
no
small
responsibility
upon
ourselves
alving
do
you
think
we
can
do
otherwise
manders
no
that
is
just
the
point
we
really
can
not
do
otherwise
we
ought
not
to
expose
ourselves
to
misinterpretation
and
we
have
no
right
whatever
to
give
offence
to
the
weaker
brethren
alving
you
as
a
clergyman
certainly
should
not
manders
i
really
think
too
we
may
trust
that
such
an
institution
has
fortune
on
its
side
in
fact
that
it
stands
under
a
special
providence
alving
let
us
hope
so
pastor
manders
manders
then
we
will
let
it
take
its
chance
alving
yes
certainly
manders
very
well
so
be
it
makes
a
note
then
no
insurance
alving
it
odd
that
you
should
just
happen
to
mention
the
matter
manders
i
have
often
thought
of
asking
you
about
it
mrs
for
we
very
nearly
had
a
fire
down
there
yesterday
manders
you
do
say
so
alving
oh
it
was
a
trifling
matter
a
heap
of
shavings
had
caught
fire
in
the
carpenter
workshop
manders
where
engstrand
works
alving
yes
they
say
he
often
very
careless
with
matches
manders
he
has
so
much
on
his
mind
that
man
so
many
things
to
fight
against
thank
god
he
is
now
striving
to
lead
a
decent
life
i
hear
alving
indeed
who
says
so
manders
he
himself
assures
me
of
it
and
he
is
certainly
a
capital
workman
alving
oh
yes
so
long
as
he
sober
manders
ah
that
melancholy
weakness
but
he
is
often
driven
to
it
by
his
injured
leg
he
says
last
time
he
was
in
town
i
was
really
touched
by
him
he
came
and
thanked
me
so
warmly
for
having
got
him
work
here
so
that
he
might
be
near
regina
alving
he
does
see
much
of
her
manders
oh
yes
he
has
a
talk
with
her
every
day
he
told
me
so
himself
alving
well
it
may
be
so
manders
he
feels
so
acutely
that
he
needs
some
one
to
keep
a
firm
hold
on
him
when
temptation
comes
that
is
what
i
can
not
help
liking
about
jacob
engstrand
he
comes
to
you
so
helplessly
accusing
himself
and
confessing
his
own
weakness
the
last
time
he
was
talking
to
me
believe
me
alving
supposing
it
were
a
real
necessity
for
him
to
have
regina
home
again
alving
rising
hastily
regina
you
must
not
set
yourself
against
it
alving
indeed
i
shall
set
myself
against
it
and
besides
regina
is
to
have
a
position
in
the
orphanage
manders
but
after
all
remember
he
is
her
father
alving
oh
i
know
very
well
what
sort
of
a
father
he
has
been
to
her
no
she
shall
never
go
to
him
with
my
goodwill
manders
rising
my
dear
lady
do
take
the
matter
so
warmly
you
sadly
misjudge
poor
engstrand
you
seem
to
be
quite
terrified
alving
more
quietly
it
makes
no
difference
i
have
taken
regina
into
my
house
and
there
she
shall
stay
listens
hush
my
dear
manders
say
no
more
about
it
her
face
lights
up
with
gladness
listen
there
is
oswald
coming
downstairs
now
we
think
of
no
one
but
him
oswald
alving
in
a
light
overcoat
hat
in
hand
and
smoking
a
large
meerschaum
enters
by
the
door
on
the
left
he
stops
in
the
doorway
oswald
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
you
were
in
the
study
comes
forward
pastor
manders
manders
staring
ah
how
strange
alving
well
now
what
do
you
think
of
him
manders
manders
i
i
can
it
really
be
oswald
yes
it
really
the
prodigal
son
sir
manders
protesting
my
dear
young
friend
oswald
well
then
the
lost
sheep
found
alving
oswald
is
thinking
of
the
time
when
you
were
so
much
opposed
to
his
becoming
a
painter
manders
to
our
human
eyes
many
a
step
seems
dubious
which
afterwards
proves
wrings
his
hand
but
first
of
all
welcome
welcome
home
do
not
think
my
dear
oswald
i
suppose
i
may
call
you
by
your
christian
name
oswald
what
else
should
you
call
me
manders
very
good
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
this
my
dear
oswald
you
must
not
think
that
i
utterly
condemn
the
artist
calling
i
have
no
doubt
there
are
many
who
can
keep
their
inner
self
unharmed
in
that
profession
as
in
any
other
oswald
let
us
hope
so
alving
beaming
with
delight
i
know
one
who
has
kept
both
his
inner
and
his
outer
self
unharmed
just
look
at
him
manders
oswald
moves
restlessly
about
the
room
yes
yes
my
dear
mother
let
say
no
more
about
it
manders
why
certainly
that
is
undeniable
and
you
have
begun
to
make
a
name
for
yourself
already
the
newspapers
have
often
spoken
of
you
most
favourably
just
lately
i
fancy
i
have
seen
your
name
quite
so
often
oswald
up
in
the
conservatory
i
have
been
able
to
paint
so
much
lately
alving
even
a
painter
needs
a
little
rest
now
and
then
manders
no
doubt
no
doubt
and
meanwhile
he
can
be
preparing
himself
and
mustering
his
forces
for
some
great
work
oswald
mother
will
dinner
soon
be
ready
alving
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
has
a
capital
appetite
thank
god
manders
and
a
taste
for
tobacco
too
oswald
i
found
my
father
pipe
in
my
room
manders
aha
then
that
accounts
for
it
alving
for
what
manders
when
oswald
appeared
there
in
the
doorway
with
the
pipe
in
his
mouth
i
could
have
sworn
i
saw
his
father
large
as
life
oswald
no
really
alving
oh
how
can
you
say
so
oswald
takes
after
me
manders
yes
but
there
is
an
expression
about
the
corners
of
the
mouth
something
about
the
lips
that
reminds
one
exactly
of
alving
at
any
rate
now
that
he
is
smoking
alving
not
in
the
least
oswald
has
rather
a
clerical
curve
about
his
mouth
i
think
manders
yes
yes
some
of
my
colleagues
have
much
the
same
expression
alving
but
put
your
pipe
away
my
dear
boy
i
wo
have
smoking
in
here
oswald
does
so
by
all
means
i
only
wanted
to
try
it
for
i
once
smoked
it
when
i
was
a
child
alving
you
oswald
yes
i
was
quite
small
at
the
time
i
recollect
i
came
up
to
father
room
one
evening
when
he
was
in
great
spirits
alving
oh
you
ca
recollect
anything
of
those
times
oswald
yes
i
recollect
it
distinctly
he
took
me
on
his
knee
and
gave
me
the
pipe
smoke
boy
he
said
smoke
away
boy
and
i
smoked
as
hard
as
i
could
until
i
felt
i
was
growing
quite
pale
and
the
perspiration
stood
in
great
drops
on
my
forehead
then
he
burst
out
laughing
heartily
manders
that
was
most
extraordinary
alving
my
dear
friend
it
only
something
oswald
has
dreamt
oswald
no
mother
i
assure
you
i
did
dream
it
for
do
you
remember
this
you
came
and
carried
me
out
into
the
nursery
then
i
was
sick
and
i
saw
that
you
were
did
father
often
play
such
practical
jokes
manders
in
his
youth
he
overflowed
with
the
joy
of
life
oswald
and
yet
he
managed
to
do
so
much
in
the
world
so
much
that
was
good
and
useful
although
he
died
so
early
manders
yes
you
have
inherited
the
name
of
an
energetic
and
admirable
man
my
dear
oswald
alving
no
doubt
it
will
be
an
incentive
to
you
oswald
it
ought
to
indeed
manders
it
was
good
of
you
to
come
home
for
the
ceremony
in
his
honour
oswald
i
could
do
no
less
for
my
father
alving
and
i
am
to
keep
him
so
long
that
is
the
best
of
all
manders
you
are
going
to
pass
the
winter
at
home
i
hear
oswald
my
stay
is
indefinite
sir
but
ah
it
is
good
to
be
at
home
alving
beaming
yes
is
it
dear
manders
looking
sympathetically
at
him
you
went
out
into
the
world
early
my
dear
oswald
oswald
i
did
i
sometimes
wonder
whether
it
was
too
early
alving
oh
not
at
all
a
healthy
lad
is
all
the
better
for
it
especially
when
he
an
only
child
he
ought
to
hang
on
at
home
with
his
mother
and
father
and
get
spoilt
manders
that
is
a
very
disputable
point
alving
a
child
proper
place
is
and
must
be
the
home
of
his
fathers
oswald
there
i
quite
agree
with
you
pastor
manders
manders
only
look
at
your
own
son
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
say
it
in
his
presence
what
has
the
consequence
been
for
him
he
is
six
or
seven
and
twenty
and
has
never
had
the
opportunity
of
learning
what
a
home
really
is
oswald
i
beg
your
pardon
pastor
there
you
quite
mistaken
manders
indeed
i
thought
you
had
lived
almost
exclusively
in
artistic
circles
oswald
so
i
have
manders
and
chiefly
among
the
younger
artists
oswald
yes
certainly
manders
but
i
thought
few
of
those
young
fellows
could
afford
to
set
up
house
and
support
a
family
oswald
there
are
many
who
can
not
afford
to
marry
sir
manders
yes
that
is
just
what
i
say
oswald
but
they
may
have
a
home
for
all
that
and
several
of
them
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
very
pleasant
homes
they
are
too
alving
follows
with
breathless
interest
nods
but
says
nothing
manders
but
i
not
talking
of
bachelors
quarters
by
a
home
i
understand
the
home
of
a
family
where
a
man
lives
with
his
wife
and
children
oswald
yes
or
with
his
children
and
his
children
mother
manders
starts
clasps
his
hands
but
good
heavens
oswald
well
manders
lives
with
his
children
mother
oswald
yes
would
you
have
him
turn
his
children
mother
out
of
doors
manders
then
it
is
illicit
relations
you
are
talking
of
irregular
marriages
as
people
call
them
oswald
i
have
never
noticed
anything
particularly
irregular
about
the
life
these
people
lead
manders
but
how
is
it
possible
that
a
a
young
man
or
young
woman
with
any
decency
of
feeling
can
endure
to
live
in
that
way
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
world
oswald
what
are
they
to
do
a
poor
young
artist
a
poor
girl
marriage
costs
a
great
deal
what
are
they
to
do
manders
what
are
they
to
do
let
me
tell
you
alving
what
they
ought
to
do
they
ought
to
exercise
from
the
first
that
is
what
they
ought
to
do
oswald
that
doctrine
will
scarcely
go
down
with
young
people
who
love
each
other
alving
no
scarcely
manders
continuing
how
can
the
authorities
tolerate
such
things
allow
them
to
go
on
in
the
light
of
day
confronting
mrs
alving
had
i
not
cause
to
be
deeply
concerned
about
your
son
in
circles
where
open
immorality
prevails
and
has
even
a
sort
of
recognised
position
oswald
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
spending
nearly
all
my
sundays
in
one
or
two
such
irregular
homes
manders
sunday
of
all
days
oswald
is
that
the
day
to
enjoy
one
self
well
never
have
i
heard
an
offensive
word
and
still
less
have
i
witnessed
anything
that
could
be
called
immoral
no
do
you
know
when
and
where
i
have
come
across
immorality
in
artistic
circles
manders
no
thank
heaven
i
do
oswald
well
then
allow
me
to
inform
you
i
have
met
with
it
when
one
or
other
of
our
pattern
husbands
and
fathers
has
come
to
paris
to
have
a
look
round
on
his
own
account
and
has
done
the
artists
the
honour
of
visiting
their
humble
haunts
they
knew
what
was
what
these
gentlemen
could
tell
us
all
about
places
and
things
we
had
never
dreamt
of
manders
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
respectable
men
from
home
here
would
oswald
have
you
never
heard
these
respectable
men
when
they
got
home
again
talking
about
the
way
in
which
immorality
runs
rampant
abroad
manders
yes
no
doubt
alving
i
have
too
oswald
well
you
may
take
their
word
for
it
they
know
what
they
are
talking
about
presses
his
hands
to
his
head
oh
that
that
great
free
glorious
life
out
there
should
be
defiled
in
such
a
way
alving
you
must
get
excited
oswald
it
not
good
for
you
oswald
yes
you
quite
right
mother
it
bad
for
me
i
know
you
see
i
wretchedly
worn
out
i
shall
go
for
a
little
turn
before
dinner
excuse
me
pastor
i
know
you
ca
take
my
point
of
view
but
i
could
help
speaking
out
he
goes
out
by
the
second
door
to
the
right
alving
my
poor
boy
manders
you
may
well
say
so
then
this
is
what
he
has
come
to
alving
looks
at
him
silently
manders
walking
up
and
down
he
called
himself
the
prodigal
son
alas
alas
alving
continues
looking
at
him
manders
and
what
do
you
say
to
all
this
alving
i
say
that
oswald
was
right
in
every
word
manders
stands
still
right
right
in
such
principles
alving
here
in
my
loneliness
i
have
come
to
the
same
way
of
thinking
pastor
manders
but
i
have
never
dared
to
say
anything
well
now
my
boy
shall
speak
for
me
manders
you
are
greatly
to
be
pitied
alving
but
now
i
must
speak
seriously
to
you
and
now
it
is
no
longer
your
business
manager
and
adviser
your
own
and
your
husband
early
friend
who
stands
before
you
it
is
the
priest
the
priest
who
stood
before
you
in
the
moment
of
your
life
when
you
had
gone
farthest
astray
alving
and
what
has
the
priest
to
say
to
me
manders
i
will
first
stir
up
your
memory
a
little
the
moment
is
well
chosen
will
be
the
tenth
anniversary
of
your
husband
death
the
memorial
in
his
honour
will
be
unveiled
i
shall
have
to
speak
to
the
whole
assembled
multitude
but
i
will
speak
to
you
alone
alving
very
well
pastor
manders
speak
manders
do
you
remember
that
after
less
than
a
year
of
married
life
you
stood
on
the
verge
of
an
abyss
that
you
forsook
your
house
and
home
that
you
fled
from
your
husband
yes
alving
fled
fled
and
refused
to
return
to
him
however
much
he
begged
and
prayed
you
alving
have
you
forgotten
how
infinitely
miserable
i
was
in
that
first
year
manders
it
is
the
very
mark
of
the
spirit
of
rebellion
to
crave
for
happiness
in
this
life
what
right
have
we
human
beings
to
happiness
we
have
simply
to
do
our
duty
alving
and
your
duty
was
to
hold
firmly
to
the
man
you
had
once
chosen
and
to
whom
you
were
bound
by
the
holiest
ties
alving
you
know
very
well
what
sort
of
life
alving
was
leading
what
excesses
he
was
guilty
of
manders
i
know
very
well
what
rumours
there
were
about
him
and
i
am
the
last
to
approve
the
life
he
led
in
his
young
days
if
report
did
not
wrong
him
but
a
wife
is
not
appointed
to
be
her
husband
judge
it
was
your
duty
to
bear
with
humility
the
cross
which
a
higher
power
had
in
its
wisdom
laid
upon
you
but
instead
of
that
you
rebelliously
throw
away
the
cross
desert
the
backslider
whom
you
should
have
supported
go
and
risk
your
good
name
and
reputation
and
nearly
succeed
in
ruining
other
people
reputation
into
the
bargain
alving
other
people
one
other
person
you
mean
manders
it
was
incredibly
reckless
of
you
to
seek
refuge
with
me
alving
with
our
clergyman
with
our
intimate
friend
manders
just
on
that
account
yes
you
may
thank
god
that
i
possessed
the
necessary
firmness
that
i
succeeded
in
dissuading
you
from
your
wild
designs
and
that
it
was
vouchsafed
me
to
lead
you
back
to
the
path
of
duty
and
home
to
your
lawful
husband
alving
yes
pastor
manders
that
was
certainly
your
work
manders
i
was
but
a
poor
instrument
in
a
higher
hand
and
what
a
blessing
has
it
not
proved
to
you
all
the
days
of
your
life
that
i
induced
you
to
resume
the
yoke
of
duty
and
obedience
did
not
everything
happen
as
i
foretold
did
not
alving
turn
his
back
on
his
errors
as
a
man
should
did
he
not
live
with
you
from
that
time
lovingly
and
blamelessly
all
his
days
did
he
not
become
a
benefactor
to
the
whole
district
and
did
he
not
help
you
to
rise
to
his
own
level
so
that
you
little
by
little
became
his
assistant
in
all
his
undertakings
and
a
capital
assistant
too
oh
i
know
alving
that
praise
is
due
to
but
now
i
come
to
the
next
great
error
in
your
life
alving
what
do
you
mean
manders
just
as
you
once
disowned
a
wife
duty
so
you
have
since
disowned
a
mother
alving
ah
manders
you
have
been
all
your
life
under
the
dominion
of
a
pestilent
spirit
of
the
whole
bias
of
your
mind
has
been
towards
insubordination
and
lawlessness
you
have
never
known
how
to
endure
any
bond
everything
that
has
weighed
upon
you
in
life
you
have
cast
away
without
care
or
conscience
like
a
burden
you
were
free
to
throw
off
at
will
it
did
not
please
you
to
be
a
wife
any
longer
and
you
left
your
husband
you
found
it
troublesome
to
be
a
mother
and
you
sent
your
child
forth
among
strangers
alving
yes
that
is
true
i
did
so
manders
and
thus
you
have
become
a
stranger
to
him
alving
no
no
i
am
not
manders
yes
you
are
you
must
be
and
in
what
state
of
mind
has
he
returned
to
you
bethink
yourself
well
alving
you
sinned
greatly
against
your
husband
that
you
recognise
by
raising
yonder
memorial
to
him
recognise
now
also
how
you
have
sinned
against
your
son
there
may
yet
be
time
to
lead
him
back
from
the
paths
of
error
turn
back
yourself
and
save
what
may
yet
be
saved
in
him
for
with
uplifted
forefinger
verily
alving
you
are
a
mother
this
i
have
thought
it
my
duty
to
say
to
you
silence
alving
slowly
and
with
you
have
now
spoken
out
pastor
manders
and
you
are
to
speak
publicly
in
memory
of
my
husband
i
shall
not
speak
but
now
i
will
speak
frankly
to
you
as
you
have
spoken
to
me
manders
to
be
sure
you
will
plead
excuses
for
your
conduct
alving
no
i
will
only
tell
you
a
story
manders
well
alving
all
that
you
have
just
said
about
my
husband
and
me
and
our
life
after
you
had
brought
me
back
to
the
path
of
duty
as
you
called
it
about
all
that
you
know
nothing
from
personal
observation
from
that
moment
you
who
had
been
our
intimate
friend
never
set
foot
in
our
house
gain
manders
you
and
your
husband
left
the
town
immediately
after
alving
yes
and
in
my
husband
lifetime
you
never
came
to
see
us
it
was
business
that
forced
you
to
visit
me
when
you
undertook
the
affairs
of
the
orphanage
manders
softly
and
hesitatingly
helen
if
that
is
meant
as
a
reproach
i
would
beg
you
to
bear
in
mind
mrs
the
regard
you
owed
to
your
position
yes
and
that
i
was
a
runaway
wife
one
can
never
be
too
cautious
with
such
unprincipled
creatures
manders
my
dear
alving
you
know
that
is
an
absurd
exaggeration
alving
well
well
suppose
it
is
my
point
is
that
your
judgment
as
to
my
married
life
is
founded
upon
nothing
but
common
knowledge
and
report
manders
i
admit
that
what
then
alving
well
then
pastor
manders
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
sworn
to
myself
that
one
day
you
should
know
it
you
alone
manders
what
is
the
truth
then
alving
the
truth
is
that
my
husband
died
just
as
dissolute
as
he
had
lived
all
his
days
manders
feeling
after
a
chair
what
do
you
say
alving
after
nineteen
years
of
marriage
as
dissolute
in
his
desires
at
any
rate
as
he
was
before
you
married
us
manders
and
wild
oats
those
irregularities
those
excesses
if
you
like
you
call
a
dissolute
life
alving
our
doctor
used
the
expression
manders
i
do
not
understand
you
alving
you
need
not
manders
it
almost
makes
me
dizzy
your
whole
married
life
the
seeming
union
of
all
these
years
was
nothing
more
than
a
hidden
abyss
alving
neither
more
nor
less
now
you
know
it
manders
this
is
this
is
inconceivable
to
me
i
can
not
grasp
it
i
can
not
realise
it
but
how
was
it
possible
to
how
could
such
a
state
of
things
be
kept
secret
alving
that
has
been
my
ceaseless
struggle
day
after
day
after
oswald
birth
i
thought
alving
seemed
to
be
a
little
better
but
it
did
not
last
long
and
then
i
had
to
struggle
twice
as
hard
fighting
as
though
for
life
or
death
so
that
nobody
should
know
what
sort
of
man
my
child
father
was
and
you
know
what
power
alving
had
of
winning
people
hearts
nobody
seemed
able
to
believe
anything
but
good
of
him
he
was
one
of
those
people
whose
life
does
not
bite
upon
their
reputation
but
at
last
manders
for
you
must
know
the
whole
story
the
most
repulsive
thing
of
all
happened
manders
more
repulsive
than
what
you
have
told
me
alving
i
had
gone
on
bearing
with
him
although
i
knew
very
well
the
secrets
of
his
life
out
of
doors
but
when
he
brought
the
scandal
within
our
own
walls
manders
impossible
here
alving
yes
here
in
our
own
home
it
was
there
pointing
towards
the
first
door
on
the
right
in
the
that
i
first
came
to
know
of
it
i
was
busy
with
something
in
there
and
the
door
was
standing
ajar
i
heard
our
housemaid
come
up
from
the
garden
with
water
for
those
flowers
manders
well
alving
soon
after
i
heard
alving
come
in
too
i
heard
him
say
something
softly
to
her
and
then
i
heard
with
a
short
laugh
oh
it
still
sounds
in
my
ears
so
hateful
and
yet
so
ludicrous
i
heard
my
own
whisper
let
me
go
alving
let
me
be
manders
what
unseemly
levity
on
his
part
but
it
can
not
have
been
more
than
levity
alving
believe
me
it
can
not
alving
i
soon
knew
what
to
believe
alving
had
his
way
with
the
girl
and
that
connection
had
consequences
manders
manders
as
though
petrified
such
things
in
this
house
in
this
house
alving
i
had
borne
a
great
deal
in
this
house
to
keep
him
at
home
in
the
evenings
and
at
night
i
had
to
make
myself
his
boon
companion
in
his
secret
orgies
up
in
his
room
there
i
have
had
to
sit
alone
with
him
to
clink
glasses
and
drink
with
him
and
to
listen
to
his
ribald
silly
talk
i
have
had
to
fight
with
him
to
get
him
dragged
to
bed
manders
moved
and
you
were
able
to
bear
all
this
alving
i
had
to
bear
it
for
my
little
boy
sake
but
when
the
last
insult
was
added
when
my
own
then
i
swore
to
myself
this
shall
come
to
an
end
and
so
i
took
the
reins
into
my
own
hand
the
whole
control
over
him
and
everything
else
for
now
i
had
a
weapon
against
him
you
see
he
dared
not
oppose
me
it
was
then
i
sent
oswald
away
from
home
he
was
nearly
seven
years
old
and
was
beginning
to
observe
and
ask
questions
as
children
do
that
i
could
not
bear
it
seemed
to
me
the
child
must
be
poisoned
by
merely
breathing
the
air
of
this
polluted
home
that
was
why
i
sent
him
away
and
now
you
can
see
too
why
he
was
never
allowed
to
set
foot
inside
his
home
so
long
as
his
father
lived
no
one
knows
what
that
cost
me
manders
you
have
indeed
had
a
life
of
trial
alving
i
could
never
have
borne
it
if
i
had
not
had
my
work
for
i
may
truly
say
that
i
have
worked
all
the
additions
to
the
estate
all
the
improvements
all
the
appliances
that
alving
was
so
much
praised
for
having
introduced
do
you
suppose
he
had
energy
for
anything
of
the
sort
he
who
lay
all
day
on
the
sofa
reading
an
old
court
guide
no
but
i
may
tell
you
this
too
when
he
had
his
better
intervals
it
was
i
who
urged
him
on
it
was
i
who
had
to
drag
the
whole
load
when
he
relapsed
into
his
evil
ways
or
sank
into
querulous
wretchedness
manders
and
it
is
to
this
man
that
you
raise
a
memorial
alving
there
you
see
the
power
of
an
evil
conscience
manders
evil
what
do
you
mean
alving
it
always
seemed
to
me
impossible
but
that
the
truth
must
come
out
and
be
believed
so
the
orphanage
was
to
deaden
all
rumours
and
set
every
doubt
at
rest
manders
in
that
you
have
certainly
not
missed
your
aim
alving
alving
and
besides
i
had
one
other
reason
i
was
determined
that
oswald
my
own
boy
should
inherit
nothing
whatever
from
his
father
manders
then
it
is
alving
fortune
that
alving
yes
the
sums
i
have
spent
upon
the
orphanage
year
by
year
make
up
the
amount
i
have
reckoned
it
up
precisely
the
amount
which
made
lieutenant
alving
a
good
match
in
his
day
manders
i
do
understand
alving
it
was
my
i
do
not
choose
that
that
money
should
pass
into
oswald
hands
my
son
shall
have
everything
from
me
everything
oswald
alving
enters
through
the
second
door
to
the
right
he
has
taken
of
his
hat
and
overcoat
in
the
hall
alving
going
towards
him
are
you
back
again
already
my
dear
dear
boy
oswald
yes
what
can
a
fellow
do
out
of
doors
in
this
eternal
rain
but
i
hear
dinner
is
ready
that
capital
regina
with
a
parcel
from
the
a
parcel
has
come
for
you
alving
hands
it
to
her
alving
with
a
glance
at
mr
manders
no
doubt
copies
of
the
ode
for
ceremony
manders
h
regina
and
dinner
is
ready
alving
very
well
we
will
come
directly
i
will
just
begins
to
open
the
parcel
regina
to
oswald
would
alving
like
red
or
white
wine
oswald
both
if
you
please
regina
very
well
sir
she
goes
into
the
oswald
i
may
as
well
help
to
uncork
it
he
also
goes
into
the
dining
room
the
door
of
which
swings
half
open
behind
him
alving
who
has
opened
the
parcel
yes
i
thought
so
here
is
the
ceremonial
ode
pastor
manders
manders
with
folded
hands
with
what
countenance
i
am
to
deliver
my
discourse
alving
oh
you
will
get
through
it
somehow
manders
softly
so
as
not
to
be
heard
in
the
yes
it
would
not
do
to
provoke
scandal
alving
under
her
breath
but
firmly
no
but
then
this
long
hateful
comedy
will
be
ended
from
the
day
after
i
shall
act
in
every
way
as
though
he
who
is
dead
had
never
lived
in
this
house
there
shall
be
no
one
here
but
my
boy
and
his
mother
from
the
comes
the
noise
of
a
chair
overturned
and
at
the
same
moment
is
heard
regina
sharply
but
in
a
whisper
oswald
take
care
are
you
mad
let
me
go
alving
starts
in
terror
ah
she
stares
wildly
towards
the
door
oswald
is
heard
laughing
and
humming
a
bottle
is
uncorked
manders
agitated
what
can
be
the
matter
what
is
it
alving
alving
hoarsely
ghosts
the
couple
from
the
conservatory
risen
again
manders
is
it
possible
regina
is
she
alving
yes
come
not
a
word
she
seizes
pastor
manders
by
the
arm
and
walks
unsteadily
towards
the
act
second
the
same
room
the
mist
still
lies
heavy
over
the
landscape
manders
and
alving
enter
from
the
alving
still
in
the
doorway
note
a
phrase
equivalent
to
the
german
die
may
good
digestion
wait
on
appetite
manders
turns
back
towards
the
you
coming
too
oswald
oswald
from
within
no
thank
you
i
think
i
shall
go
out
a
little
alving
yes
do
the
weather
seems
a
little
brighter
now
she
shuts
the
door
goes
to
the
hall
door
and
calls
regina
regina
outside
yes
alving
alving
go
down
to
the
laundry
and
help
with
the
garlands
regina
yes
alving
alving
assures
herself
that
regina
goes
then
shuts
the
door
manders
i
suppose
he
can
not
overhear
us
in
there
alving
not
when
the
door
is
shut
besides
he
just
going
out
manders
i
am
still
quite
upset
i
do
know
how
i
could
swallow
a
morsel
of
dinner
alving
controlling
her
nervousness
walks
up
and
down
nor
i
but
what
is
to
be
done
now
manders
yes
what
is
to
be
done
i
am
really
quite
at
a
loss
i
am
so
utterly
without
experience
in
matters
of
this
sort
alving
i
feel
sure
that
so
far
no
mischief
has
been
done
manders
no
heaven
forbid
but
it
is
an
unseemly
state
of
things
nevertheless
alving
it
is
only
an
idle
fancy
on
oswald
part
you
may
be
sure
of
that
manders
well
as
i
say
i
am
not
accustomed
to
affairs
of
the
kind
but
i
should
certainly
think
alving
out
of
the
house
she
must
go
and
that
immediately
that
is
as
clear
as
daylight
manders
yes
of
course
she
must
alving
but
where
to
it
would
not
be
right
to
manders
where
to
home
to
her
father
of
course
alving
to
whom
did
you
say
manders
to
her
but
then
engstrand
is
not
good
god
alving
it
impossible
you
must
be
mistaken
after
all
alving
unfortunately
there
is
no
possibility
of
mistake
johanna
confessed
everything
to
me
and
alving
could
not
deny
it
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
get
the
matter
hushed
up
manders
no
you
could
do
nothing
else
alving
the
girl
left
our
service
at
once
and
got
a
good
sum
of
money
to
hold
her
tongue
for
the
time
the
rest
she
managed
for
herself
when
she
got
to
town
she
renewed
her
old
acquaintance
with
engstrand
no
doubt
let
him
see
that
she
had
money
in
her
purse
and
told
him
some
tale
about
a
foreigner
who
put
in
here
with
a
yacht
that
summer
so
she
and
engstrand
got
married
in
hot
haste
why
you
married
them
yourself
manders
but
then
how
to
account
for
i
recollect
distinctly
engstrand
coming
to
give
notice
of
the
marriage
he
was
quite
overwhelmed
with
contrition
and
bitterly
reproached
himself
for
the
misbehaviour
he
and
his
sweetheart
had
been
guilty
of
alving
yes
of
course
he
had
to
take
the
blame
upon
himself
manders
but
such
a
piece
of
duplicity
on
his
part
and
towards
me
too
i
never
could
have
believed
it
of
jacob
engstrand
i
shall
not
fail
to
take
him
seriously
to
task
he
may
be
sure
of
and
then
the
immorality
of
such
a
connection
for
money
how
much
did
the
girl
receive
alving
three
hundred
dollars
manders
just
think
of
it
for
a
miserable
three
hundred
dollars
to
go
and
marry
a
fallen
woman
alving
then
what
have
you
to
say
of
me
i
went
and
married
a
fallen
man
manders
why
good
heavens
what
are
you
talking
about
a
fallen
man
alving
do
you
think
alving
was
any
purer
when
i
went
with
him
to
the
altar
than
johanna
was
when
engstrand
married
her
manders
well
but
there
is
a
world
of
difference
between
the
two
cases
alving
not
so
much
difference
after
all
except
in
the
price
a
miserable
three
hundred
dollars
and
a
whole
fortune
manders
how
can
you
compare
such
absolutely
dissimilar
cases
you
had
taken
counsel
with
your
own
heart
and
with
your
natural
advisers
alving
without
looking
at
him
i
thought
you
understood
where
what
you
call
my
heart
had
strayed
to
at
the
time
manders
distantly
had
i
understood
anything
of
the
kind
i
should
not
have
been
a
daily
guest
in
your
husband
house
alving
at
any
rate
the
fact
remains
that
with
myself
i
took
no
counsel
whatever
manders
well
then
with
your
nearest
relatives
as
your
duty
bade
you
with
your
mother
and
your
two
aunts
alving
yes
that
is
true
those
three
cast
up
the
account
for
me
oh
it
marvellous
how
clearly
they
made
out
that
it
would
be
downright
madness
to
refuse
such
an
offer
if
mother
could
only
see
me
now
and
know
what
all
that
grandeur
has
come
to
manders
nobody
can
be
held
responsible
for
the
result
this
at
least
remains
clear
your
marriage
was
in
full
accordance
with
law
and
order
alving
at
the
window
oh
that
perpetual
law
and
order
i
often
think
that
is
what
does
all
the
mischief
in
this
world
of
ours
manders
alving
that
is
a
sinful
way
of
talking
alving
well
i
ca
help
it
i
must
have
done
with
all
this
constraint
and
insincerity
i
can
endure
it
no
longer
i
must
work
my
way
out
to
freedom
manders
what
do
you
mean
by
that
alving
drumming
on
the
window
frame
i
ought
never
to
have
concealed
the
facts
of
alving
life
but
at
that
time
i
dared
not
do
anything
else
i
was
afraid
partly
on
my
own
account
i
was
such
a
coward
manders
a
coward
alving
if
people
had
come
to
know
anything
they
would
have
said
poor
man
with
a
runaway
wife
no
wonder
he
kicks
over
the
traces
manders
such
remarks
might
have
been
made
with
a
certain
show
of
right
alving
looking
steadily
at
him
if
i
were
what
i
ought
to
be
i
should
go
to
oswald
and
say
listen
my
boy
your
father
led
a
vicious
life
manders
merciful
heavens
mrs
and
then
i
should
tell
him
all
i
have
told
you
every
word
of
it
manders
you
shock
me
unspeakably
alving
alving
yes
i
know
that
i
know
that
very
well
i
myself
am
shocked
at
the
idea
goes
away
from
the
window
i
am
such
a
coward
manders
you
call
it
cowardice
to
do
your
plain
duty
have
you
forgotten
that
a
son
ought
to
love
and
honour
his
father
and
mother
alving
do
not
let
us
talk
in
such
general
terms
let
us
ask
ought
oswald
to
love
and
honour
chamberlain
alving
manders
is
there
no
voice
in
your
mother
heart
that
forbids
you
to
destroy
your
son
ideals
alving
but
what
about
the
truth
manders
but
what
about
the
ideals
alving
oh
ideals
ideals
if
only
i
were
not
such
a
coward
manders
do
not
despise
ideals
alving
they
will
avenge
themselves
cruelly
take
oswald
case
he
unfortunately
seems
to
have
few
enough
ideals
as
it
is
but
i
can
see
that
his
father
stands
before
him
as
an
ideal
alving
yes
that
is
true
manders
and
this
habit
of
mind
you
have
yourself
implanted
and
fostered
by
your
letters
alving
yes
in
my
superstitious
awe
for
duty
and
the
proprieties
i
lied
to
my
boy
year
after
year
oh
what
a
coward
what
a
coward
i
have
been
manders
you
have
established
a
happy
illusion
in
your
son
heart
alving
and
assuredly
you
ought
not
to
undervalue
it
alving
h
who
knows
whether
it
is
so
happy
after
all
but
at
any
rate
i
will
not
have
any
tampering
with
regina
he
shall
not
go
and
wreck
the
poor
girl
life
manders
no
good
god
that
would
be
terrible
alving
if
i
knew
he
was
in
earnest
and
that
it
would
be
for
his
happiness
manders
what
what
then
alving
but
it
could
be
for
unfortunately
regina
is
not
the
right
sort
of
woman
manders
well
what
then
what
do
you
mean
alving
if
i
were
such
a
pitiful
coward
i
should
say
to
him
marry
her
or
make
what
arrangement
you
please
only
let
us
have
nothing
underhand
about
it
manders
merciful
heavens
would
you
let
them
marry
anything
so
dreadful
so
unheard
of
alving
do
you
really
mean
unheard
of
frankly
pastor
manders
do
you
suppose
that
throughout
the
country
there
are
not
plenty
of
married
couples
as
closely
akin
as
they
manders
i
do
in
the
least
understand
you
alving
oh
yes
indeed
you
do
manders
ah
you
are
thinking
of
the
possibility
that
alas
yes
family
life
is
certainly
not
always
so
pure
as
it
ought
to
be
but
in
such
a
case
as
you
point
to
one
can
never
know
at
least
with
any
certainty
here
on
the
other
hand
that
you
a
mother
can
think
of
letting
your
son
alving
but
i
can
not
i
would
for
anything
in
the
world
that
is
precisely
what
i
am
saying
manders
no
because
you
are
a
coward
as
you
put
it
but
if
you
were
not
a
coward
then
good
god
a
connection
so
shocking
alving
so
far
as
that
goes
they
say
we
are
all
sprung
from
connections
of
that
sort
and
who
is
it
that
arranged
the
world
so
pastor
manders
manders
questions
of
that
kind
i
must
decline
to
discuss
with
you
alving
you
are
far
from
being
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
for
them
but
that
you
dare
to
call
your
scruples
cowardly
alving
let
me
tell
you
what
i
mean
i
am
timid
and
because
of
the
ghosts
that
hang
about
me
and
that
i
can
never
quite
shake
off
manders
what
do
you
say
hangs
about
you
alving
ghosts
when
i
heard
regina
and
oswald
in
there
it
was
as
though
ghosts
rose
up
before
me
but
i
almost
think
we
are
all
of
us
ghosts
pastor
manders
it
is
not
only
what
we
have
inherited
from
our
father
and
mother
that
walks
in
us
it
is
all
sorts
of
dead
ideas
and
lifeless
old
beliefs
and
so
forth
they
have
no
vitality
but
they
cling
to
us
all
the
same
and
we
can
not
shake
them
off
whenever
i
take
up
a
newspaper
i
seem
to
see
ghosts
gliding
between
the
lines
there
must
be
ghosts
all
the
country
over
as
thick
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
and
then
we
are
one
and
all
so
pitifully
afraid
of
the
light
manders
aha
here
we
have
the
fruits
of
your
reading
and
pretty
fruits
they
are
upon
my
word
oh
those
horrible
revolutionary
books
alving
you
are
mistaken
my
dear
pastor
it
was
you
yourself
who
set
me
thinking
and
i
thank
you
for
it
with
all
my
heart
manders
i
alving
yes
when
you
forced
me
under
the
yoke
of
what
you
called
duty
and
obligation
when
you
lauded
as
right
and
proper
what
my
whole
soul
rebelled
against
as
something
loathsome
it
was
then
that
i
began
to
look
into
the
seams
of
your
doctrines
i
wanted
only
to
pick
at
a
single
knot
but
when
i
had
got
that
undone
the
whole
thing
ravelled
out
and
then
i
understood
that
it
was
all
manders
softly
with
emotion
and
was
that
the
upshot
of
my
hardest
battle
alving
call
it
rather
your
most
pitiful
defeat
manders
it
was
my
greatest
victory
helen
the
victory
over
myself
alving
it
was
a
crime
against
us
both
manders
when
you
went
astray
and
came
to
me
crying
here
i
am
take
me
i
commanded
you
saying
woman
go
home
to
your
lawful
husband
was
that
a
crime
alving
yes
i
think
so
manders
we
two
do
not
understand
each
other
alving
not
now
at
any
rate
manders
never
never
in
my
most
secret
thoughts
have
i
regarded
you
otherwise
than
as
another
wife
alving
oh
indeed
manders
helen
alving
people
so
easily
forget
their
past
selves
manders
i
do
not
i
am
what
i
always
was
alving
changing
the
subject
well
well
well
do
let
us
talk
of
old
times
any
longer
you
are
now
over
head
and
ears
in
boards
and
committees
and
i
am
fighting
my
battle
with
ghosts
both
within
me
and
without
manders
those
without
i
shall
help
you
to
lay
after
all
the
terrible
things
i
have
heard
from
you
today
i
can
not
in
conscience
permit
an
unprotected
girl
to
remain
in
your
house
alving
do
you
think
the
best
plan
would
be
to
get
her
provided
for
i
mean
by
a
good
marriage
manders
no
doubt
i
think
it
would
be
desirable
for
her
in
every
respect
regina
is
now
at
the
age
when
of
course
i
do
know
much
about
these
things
but
alving
regina
matured
very
early
manders
yes
i
thought
so
i
have
an
impression
that
she
was
remarkably
well
developed
physically
when
i
prepared
her
for
confirmation
but
in
the
meantime
she
ought
to
be
at
home
under
her
father
eye
ah
but
engstrand
is
not
that
he
that
he
could
so
hide
the
truth
from
me
a
knock
at
the
door
into
the
hall
alving
who
can
this
be
come
in
engstrand
in
his
sunday
clothes
in
the
doorway
i
humbly
beg
your
pardon
but
manders
aha
h
alving
is
that
you
engstrand
there
was
none
of
the
servants
about
so
i
took
the
great
liberty
of
just
knocking
alving
oh
very
well
come
in
do
you
want
to
speak
to
me
engstrand
comes
in
no
i
obliged
to
you
it
was
with
his
reverence
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
or
two
manders
walking
up
and
down
the
room
ah
indeed
you
want
to
speak
to
me
do
you
engstrand
yes
i
like
so
terrible
much
to
manders
stops
in
front
of
him
well
may
i
ask
what
you
want
engstrand
well
it
was
just
this
your
reverence
we
been
paid
off
down
yonder
my
grateful
thanks
to
you
and
now
finished
i
been
thinking
it
would
be
but
right
and
proper
if
we
that
have
been
working
so
honestly
together
all
this
time
well
i
was
thinking
we
ought
to
end
up
with
a
little
manders
a
down
at
the
orphanage
engstrand
oh
if
your
reverence
does
think
it
proper
manders
oh
yes
i
do
but
h
engstrand
i
been
in
the
habit
of
offering
up
a
little
prayer
in
the
evenings
myself
alving
have
you
engstrand
yes
every
now
and
then
just
a
little
edification
in
a
manner
of
speaking
but
i
a
poor
common
man
and
have
little
enough
gift
god
help
me
and
so
i
thought
as
the
reverend
manders
happened
to
be
here
i
manders
well
you
see
engstrand
i
have
a
question
to
put
to
you
first
are
you
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
for
such
a
meeting
do
you
feel
your
conscience
clear
and
at
ease
engstrand
oh
god
help
us
your
reverence
we
better
not
talk
about
conscience
manders
yes
that
is
just
what
we
must
talk
about
what
have
you
to
answer
engstrand
why
a
man
conscience
it
can
be
bad
enough
now
and
then
manders
ah
you
admit
that
then
perhaps
you
will
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
tell
me
the
real
truth
about
regina
alving
quickly
manders
manders
reassuringly
please
allow
me
engstrand
about
regina
lord
what
a
turn
you
gave
me
looks
at
mrs
alving
there
nothing
wrong
about
regina
is
there
manders
we
will
hope
not
but
i
mean
what
is
the
truth
about
you
and
regina
you
pass
for
her
father
eh
engstrand
uncertain
well
h
your
reverence
knows
all
about
me
and
poor
johanna
manders
come
now
no
more
prevarication
your
wife
told
alving
the
whole
story
before
quitting
her
service
engstrand
well
then
may
now
did
she
really
manders
you
see
we
know
you
now
engstrand
engstrand
and
she
swore
and
took
her
bible
oath
manders
did
she
take
her
bible
oath
engstrand
no
she
only
swore
but
she
did
it
that
manders
and
you
have
hidden
the
truth
from
me
all
these
years
hidden
it
from
me
who
have
trusted
you
without
reserve
in
everything
engstrand
well
i
ca
deny
it
manders
have
i
deserved
this
of
you
engstrand
have
i
not
always
been
ready
to
help
you
in
word
and
deed
so
far
as
it
lay
in
my
power
answer
me
have
i
not
engstrand
it
would
have
been
a
poor
for
me
many
a
time
but
for
the
reverend
manders
manders
and
this
is
how
you
reward
me
you
cause
me
to
enter
falsehoods
in
the
church
register
and
you
withhold
from
me
year
after
year
the
explanations
you
owed
alike
to
me
and
to
the
truth
your
conduct
has
been
wholly
inexcusable
engstrand
and
from
this
time
forward
i
have
done
with
you
engstrand
with
a
sigh
yes
i
suppose
there
no
help
for
it
manders
how
can
you
possibly
justify
yourself
engstrand
who
could
ever
have
thought
she
have
gone
and
made
bad
worse
by
talking
about
it
will
your
reverence
just
fancy
yourself
in
the
same
trouble
as
poor
johanna
manders
i
engstrand
lord
bless
you
i
do
mean
just
exactly
the
same
but
i
mean
if
your
reverence
had
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
as
the
saying
goes
we
menfolk
ought
to
judge
a
poor
woman
too
hardly
your
reverence
manders
i
am
not
doing
so
it
is
you
i
am
reproaching
engstrand
might
i
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
your
reverence
a
bit
of
a
question
manders
yes
if
you
want
to
engstrand
is
it
right
and
proper
for
a
man
to
raise
up
the
fallen
manders
most
certainly
it
is
engstrand
and
is
a
man
bound
to
keep
his
sacred
word
manders
why
of
course
he
is
but
engstrand
when
johanna
had
got
into
trouble
through
that
englishman
or
it
might
have
been
an
american
or
a
russian
as
they
call
them
well
you
see
she
came
down
into
the
town
poor
thing
she
sent
me
about
my
business
once
or
twice
before
for
she
could
bear
the
sight
of
anything
as
was
handsome
and
i
got
this
damaged
leg
of
mine
your
reverence
recollects
how
i
ventured
up
into
a
dancing
saloon
where
seafaring
men
was
carrying
on
with
drink
and
devilry
as
the
saying
goes
and
then
when
i
was
for
giving
them
a
bit
of
an
admonition
to
lead
a
new
life
alving
at
the
window
h
manders
i
know
all
about
that
engstrand
the
ruffians
threw
you
downstairs
you
have
told
me
of
the
affair
already
your
infirmity
is
an
honour
to
you
engstrand
i
not
puffed
up
about
it
your
reverence
but
what
i
wanted
to
say
was
that
when
she
came
and
confessed
all
to
me
with
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
i
can
tell
your
reverence
i
was
sore
at
heart
to
hear
it
manders
were
you
indeed
engstrand
well
go
on
engstrand
so
i
says
to
her
the
american
he
sailing
about
on
the
boundless
sea
and
as
for
you
johanna
says
i
you
committed
a
grievous
sin
and
you
a
fallen
creature
but
jacob
engstrand
says
i
he
got
two
good
legs
to
stand
upon
he
has
you
see
your
reverence
i
was
speaking
manders
i
understand
quite
well
go
on
engstrand
well
that
was
how
i
raised
her
up
and
made
an
honest
woman
of
her
so
as
folks
should
get
to
know
how
as
she
gone
astray
with
foreigners
manders
in
all
that
you
acted
very
well
only
i
can
not
approve
of
your
stooping
to
take
money
engstrand
money
i
not
a
farthing
manders
inquiringly
to
mrs
alving
but
engstrand
oh
wait
a
minute
now
i
recollect
johanna
did
have
a
trifle
of
money
but
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
no
says
i
that
mammon
that
the
wages
of
sin
this
dirty
gold
or
notes
or
whatever
it
was
we
just
flint
that
back
in
the
american
face
says
i
but
he
was
off
and
away
over
the
stormy
sea
your
reverence
manders
was
he
really
my
good
fellow
engstrand
he
was
indeed
sir
so
johanna
and
i
we
agreed
that
the
money
should
go
to
the
child
education
and
so
it
did
and
i
can
account
for
every
blessed
farthing
of
it
manders
why
this
alters
the
case
considerably
engstrand
that
just
how
it
stands
your
reverence
and
i
make
so
bold
as
to
say
as
i
been
an
honest
father
to
regina
so
far
as
my
poor
strength
went
for
i
but
a
weak
vessel
worse
luck
manders
well
well
my
good
fellow
engstrand
all
the
same
i
bear
myself
witness
as
i
brought
up
the
child
and
lived
kindly
with
poor
johanna
and
ruled
over
my
own
house
as
the
scripture
has
it
but
it
could
never
enter
my
head
to
go
to
your
reverence
and
puff
myself
up
and
boast
because
even
the
likes
of
me
had
done
some
good
in
the
world
no
sir
when
anything
of
that
sort
happens
to
jacob
engstrand
he
holds
his
tongue
about
it
it
happen
so
terrible
often
i
daresay
and
when
i
do
come
to
see
your
reverence
i
find
a
mortal
deal
that
wicked
and
weak
to
talk
about
for
i
said
it
before
and
i
says
it
again
a
man
conscience
always
as
clean
as
it
might
be
manders
give
me
your
hand
jacob
engstrand
engstrand
oh
lord
your
reverence
manders
come
no
nonsense
wrings
his
hand
there
we
are
engstrand
and
if
i
might
humbly
beg
your
reverence
pardon
manders
you
on
the
contrary
it
is
i
who
ought
to
beg
your
pardon
engstrand
lord
no
sir
manders
yes
assuredly
and
i
do
it
with
all
my
heart
forgive
me
for
misunderstanding
you
i
only
wish
i
could
give
you
some
proof
of
my
hearty
regret
and
of
my
towards
you
engstrand
would
your
reverence
do
it
manders
with
the
greatest
pleasure
engstrand
well
then
here
the
very
chance
with
the
bit
of
money
saved
here
i
was
thinking
i
might
set
up
a
sailors
home
down
in
the
town
alving
you
engstrand
yes
it
might
be
a
sort
of
orphanage
too
in
a
manner
of
speaking
there
such
a
many
temptations
for
seafaring
folk
ashore
but
in
this
home
of
mine
a
man
might
feel
like
as
he
was
under
a
eye
i
was
thinking
manders
what
do
you
say
to
this
alving
engstrand
it
is
much
as
i
got
to
start
with
lord
help
me
but
if
i
could
only
find
a
helping
hand
why
manders
yes
yes
we
will
look
into
the
matter
more
closely
i
entirely
approve
of
your
plan
but
now
go
before
me
and
make
everything
ready
and
get
the
candles
lighted
so
as
to
give
the
place
an
air
of
festivity
and
then
we
will
pass
an
edifying
hour
together
my
good
fellow
for
now
i
quite
believe
you
are
in
the
right
frame
of
mind
engstrand
yes
i
trust
i
am
and
so
i
say
and
thank
you
kindly
and
take
good
care
of
regina
for
me
wipes
a
tear
from
his
eye
poor
johanna
child
well
it
a
queer
thing
now
but
it
just
like
as
if
she
growd
into
the
very
apple
of
my
eye
it
is
indeed
he
bows
and
goes
out
through
the
hall
manders
well
what
do
you
say
of
that
man
now
alving
that
was
a
very
different
account
of
matters
was
it
not
alving
yes
it
certainly
was
manders
it
only
shows
how
excessively
careful
one
ought
to
be
in
judging
one
fellow
creatures
but
what
a
heartfelt
joy
it
is
to
ascertain
that
one
has
been
mistaken
do
you
think
so
alving
i
think
you
are
and
will
always
be
a
great
baby
manders
manders
i
alving
laying
her
two
hands
upon
his
shoulders
and
i
say
that
i
have
half
a
mind
to
put
my
arms
round
your
neck
and
kiss
you
manders
stepping
hastily
back
no
no
god
bless
me
what
an
idea
alving
with
a
smile
oh
you
need
be
afraid
of
me
manders
by
the
table
you
have
sometimes
such
an
exaggerated
way
of
expressing
yourself
now
let
me
just
collect
all
the
documents
and
put
them
in
my
bag
he
does
so
there
that
all
right
and
now
for
the
present
keep
your
eyes
open
when
oswald
comes
back
i
shall
look
in
again
later
he
takes
his
hat
and
goes
out
through
the
hall
door
alving
sighs
looks
for
a
moment
out
of
the
window
sets
the
room
in
order
a
little
and
is
about
to
go
into
the
but
stops
at
the
door
with
a
cry
oswald
are
you
still
at
table
oswald
in
the
dining
room
i
only
finishing
my
cigar
alving
i
thought
you
had
gone
for
a
little
walk
oswald
in
such
weather
as
this
a
glass
clinks
alving
leaves
the
door
open
and
sits
down
with
her
knitting
on
the
sofa
by
the
window
oswald
was
that
pastor
manders
that
went
out
just
now
alving
yes
he
went
down
to
the
orphanage
oswald
h
the
glass
and
decanter
clink
again
alving
with
a
troubled
glance
dear
oswald
you
should
take
care
of
that
liqueur
it
is
strong
oswald
it
keeps
out
the
damp
alving
would
you
rather
come
in
here
to
me
oswald
i
may
smoke
in
there
alving
you
know
quite
well
you
may
smoke
cigars
oswald
oh
all
right
then
i
come
in
just
a
tiny
drop
more
first
there
he
comes
into
the
room
with
his
cigar
and
shuts
the
door
after
him
a
short
silence
where
has
the
pastor
gone
to
alving
i
have
just
told

went
down
to
the
orphanage
oswald
oh
yes
so
you
did
alving
you
should
sit
so
long
at
table
oswald
oswald
holding
his
cigar
behind
him
but
i
find
it
so
pleasant
mother
strokes
and
caresses
her
just
think
what
it
is
for
me
to
come
home
and
sit
at
mother
own
table
in
mother
room
and
eat
delicious
dishes
alving
my
dear
dear
boy
oswald
somewhat
impatiently
walks
about
and
smokes
and
what
else
can
i
do
with
myself
here
i
ca
set
to
work
at
anything
alving
why
ca
you
oswald
in
such
weather
as
this
without
a
single
ray
of
sunshine
the
whole
day
walks
up
the
room
oh
not
to
be
able
to
work
alving
perhaps
it
was
not
quite
wise
of
you
to
come
home
oswald
oh
yes
mother
i
had
to
alving
you
know
i
would
ten
times
rather
forgo
the
joy
of
having
you
here
than
let
you
oswald
stops
beside
the
table
now
just
tell
me
mother
does
it
really
make
you
so
very
happy
to
have
me
home
again
alving
does
it
make
me
happy
oswald
crumpling
up
a
newspaper

should
have
thought
it
must
be
pretty
much
the
same
to
you
whether
i
was
in
existence
or
not
alving
have
you
the
heart
to
say

on
very
well
without
me

this
time

have
got
on
without
you
that
is
true
a
silence
twilight
slowly
begins
to
fall
oswald
paces
to
and
fro
across
the
room

has
laid
his
cigar

hiding
what

is

oswald
as
before
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
write
to
you
about
it
and
since

him
by
the
arm
oswald

the
matter

both
yesterday
and
i
have
tried
to
put
the
thoughts
away
from

rising
now
you
must
tell
me
everything
oswald
oswald
draws
her
down
to
the
sofa
again

still
and
then
i
will
try
to
tell
i
complained
of
fatigue
after
my
journey
alving
well
what
then
oswald
but
it
is
that
that
is
the
matter

to
jump
up

not
ill
oswald
oswald
draws
her
down
again

still

not
what
is
commonly
called
clasps
his
hands
above
his
head
mother
my
mind
is
broken
down
ruined
i
shall
never
be
able
to
work
again
with
his
hands
before
his
face
he
buries
his
head
in
her
lap
and
breaks
into
bitter
sobbing
alving
white
and
trembling
oswald
look
at
me
no
no
it
not
true
oswald
looks
up
with
despair
in
his
eyes
never
to
be
able
to
work
again
never
never
a
living
death
mother
can
you
imagine
anything
so
horrible
alving
my
poor
boy
how
has
this
horrible
thing
come
upon
you
oswald
sitting
upright
again
that
just
what
i
can
not
possibly
grasp
or
understand
i
have
never
led
a
dissipated
life
never
in
any
respect
you
must
believe
that
of
me
mother
i
never
done
that
alving
i
am
sure
you
have
oswald
oswald
and
yet
this
has
come
upon
me
just
the
same
this
awful
misfortune
alving
oh
but
it
will
pass
over
my
dear
blessed
boy
nothing
but
trust
me
i
am
right
oswald
sadly
i
thought
so
too
at
first
but
it
is
so
alving
tell
me
everything
from
beginning
to
end
oswald
yes
i
will
alving
when
did
you
first
notice
it
oswald
it
was
directly
after
i
had
been
home
last
time
and
had
got
back
to
paris
again
i
began
to
feel
the
most
violent
pains
in
my
head
chiefly
in
the
back
of
my
head
they
seemed
to
come
it
was
as
though
a
tight
iron
ring
was
being
screwed
round
my
neck
and
upwards
alving
well
and
then
oswald
at
first
i
thought
it
was
nothing
but
the
ordinary
headache
i
had
been
so
plagued
with
while
i
was
growing
up
alving
yes
yes
oswald
but
it
was
that
i
soon
found
that
out
i
could
work
any
more
i
wanted
to
begin
upon
a
big
new
picture
but
my
powers
seemed
to
fail
me
all
my
strength
was
crippled
i
could
form
no
definite
images
everything
swam
before
me
whirling
round
and
round
oh
it
was
an
awful
state
at
last
i
sent
for
a
doctor
and
from
him
i
learned
the
truth
alving
how
do
you
mean
oswald
he
was
one
of
the
first
doctors
in
paris
i
told
him
my
symptoms
and
then
he
set
to
work
asking
me
a
string
of
questions
which
i
thought
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
i
could
imagine
what
the
man
was
after
alving
well
oswald
at
last
he
said
there
has
been
something
in
you
from
your
birth
he
used
that
very
word
alving
breathlessly
what
did
he
mean
by
that
oswald
i
did
understand
either
and
begged
him
to
explain
himself
more
clearly
and
then
the
old
cynic
said
clenching
his
fist
oh
alving
what
did
he
say
oswald
he
said
the
sins
of
the
fathers
are
visited
upon
the
children
alving
rising
slowly
the
sins
of
the
fathers
oswald
i
very
nearly
struck
him
in
the
face
alving
walks
away
across
the
room
the
sins
of
the
fathers
oswald
smiles
sadly
yes
what
do
you
think
of
that
of
course
i
assured
him
that
such
a
thing
was
out
of
the
question
but
do
you
think
he
gave
in
no
he
stuck
to
it
and
it
was
only
when
i
produced
your
letters
and
translated
the
passages
relating
to
father
alving
but
then
oswald
then
of
course
he
had
to
admit
that
he
was
on
the
wrong
track
and
so
i
learned
the
truth
the
incomprehensible
truth
i
ought
not
to
have
taken
part
with
my
comrades
in
that
lighthearted
glorious
life
of
theirs
it
had
been
too
much
for
my
strength
so
i
had
brought
it
upon
myself
alving
oswald
no
no
do
not
believe
it
oswald
no
other
explanation
was
possible
he
said
that
the
awful
part
of
it
incurably
ruined
for
life
by
my
own
heedlessness
all
that
i
meant
to
have
done
in
the
world
i
never
dare
think
of
it
again
not
able
to
think
of
it
oh
if
i
could
only
live
over
again
and
undo
all
i
have
done
he
buries
his
face
in
the
sofa
alving
wrings
her
hands
and
walks
in
silent
struggle
backwards
and
forwards
oswald
after
a
while
looks
up
and
remains
resting
upon
his
elbow
if
it
had
only
been
something
inherited
something
one
was
responsible
for
but
this
to
have
thrown
away
so
shamefully
thoughtlessly
recklessly
one
own
happiness
one
own
health
everything
in
the
world
one
future
one
very
life
alving
no
no
my
dear
darling
boy
this
is
impossible
bends
over
him
things
are
not
so
desperate
as
you
think
oswald
oh
you
do
know
springs
up
and
then
mother
to
cause
you
all
this
sorrow
many
a
time

so
very
much
about
me
alving

oswald

only
boy

are
all
i
have
in
the

her
hands
and
kisses
them
yes
yes
i
see
it
when
i
at
home
i
see
it
of
course
and
that
almost
the
hardest
part
for
but
now
you

the
whole
story

more

beautifully
she
built
and
so
thoroughly
healthy
alving
sits
by
the
table
sit
down
oswald
let
us
talk
quietly
together
oswald
sits
i
daresay
you
do
know
mother
that
i
owe
regina
some
reparation
alving
you
oswald
for
a
bit
of
thoughtlessness
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
very
innocent
at
any
rate
when
i
was
home
last
time
alving
well
oswald
she
used
often
to
ask
me
about
paris
and
i
used
to
tell
her
one
thing
and
another
then
i
recollect
i
happened
to
say
to
her
one
day
should
you
like
to
go
there
yourself
alving
well
oswald
i
saw
her
face
flush
and
then
she
said
yes
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
ah
well
i
replied
it
might
perhaps
be
managed
or
something
like
that
alving
and
then
oswald
of
course
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
but
the
day
before
yesterday
i
happened
to
ask
her
whether
she
was
glad
i
was
to
stay
at
home
so
long
alving
yes
oswald
and
then
she
gave
me
such
a
strange
look
and
asked
but
to
become
of
my
trip
to
paris
alving
her
trip
oswald
and
so
it
came
out
that
she
had
taken
the
thing
seriously
that
she
had
been
thinking
of
me
the
whole
time
and
had
set
to
work
to
learn
french
alving
so
that
was
why
oswald
mother
when
i
saw
that
fresh
lovely
splendid
girl
standing
there
before
me
till
then
i
had
hardly
noticed
her
but
when
she
stood
there
as
though
with
open
arms
ready
to
receive
me
alving
oswald
then
it
flashed
upon
me
that
in
her
lay
my
salvation
for
i
saw
that
she
was
full
of
the
joy
of
life
alving
starts
the
joy
of
life
can
there
be
salvation
in
that
regina
from
the
dining
room
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
i
sorry
to
have
been
so
long
but
i
had
to
go
to
the
cellar
places
the
bottle
on
the
table
oswald
and
now
bring
another
glass
regina
looks
at
him
in
surprise
there
is
alving
glass
alving
oswald
yes
but
bring
one
for
yourself
regina
regina
starts
and
gives
a
side
glance
at
mrs
alving
why
do
you
wait
regina
softly
and
hesitatingly
is
it
alving
wish
alving
bring
the
glass
regina
regina
goes
out
into
the
oswald
follows
her
with
his
eyes

you
noticed
how
she
walks
so
firmly
and
lightly
alving
this
can
never
be
oswald
oswald
it
a
settled
thing
ca
you
see
that
it
no
use
saying
anything
against
it
regina
enters
with
an
empty
glass

she
keeps
in
her
hand

inquiringly
at
mrs

by
the
dining

holding
the
empty
glass
in
her
hand

about
the
joy
of

not
when
i
at
home
but
you
do
understand
that
alving
yes
yes
i
think
i
almost
understand
it
now
oswald
and
then
too
the
joy
of
work
at
bottom
it
the
same
thing
but
that
too
you
know
nothing
about
alving
perhaps
you
are
right
tell
me
more
about
it
oswald
oswald
i
only
mean
that
here
people
are
brought
up
to
believe
that
work
is
a
curse
and
a
punishment
for
sin
and
that
life
is
something
miserable
something
it
would
be
best
to
have
done
with
the
sooner
the
better
alving
a
vale
of
tears
yes
and
we
certainly
do
our
best
to
make
it
one
oswald
but
in
the
great
world
people
wo
hear
of
such
things
there
nobody
really
believes
such
doctrines
any
longer
there
you
feel
it
a
positive
bliss
and
ecstasy
merely
to
draw
the
breath
of
life
mother
have
you
noticed
that
everything
i
have
painted
has
turned
upon
the
joy
of
life
always
always
upon
the
joy
of
life
light
and
sunshine
and
glorious
air
and
faces
radiant
with
happiness
that
is
why
i
afraid
of
remaining
at
home
with
you
alving
afraid
what
are
you
afraid
of
here
with
me
oswald
i
afraid
lest
all
my
instincts
should
be
warped
into
ugliness
alving
looks
steadily
at
him
do
you
think
that
is
what
would
happen
oswald
i
know
it
you
may
live
the
same
life
here
as
there
and
yet
it
wo
be
the
same
life
alving
who
has
been
listening
eagerly
rises
her
eyes
big
with
thought
and
says
now
i
see
the
sequence
of
things
oswald
what
is
it
you
see
alving

see
it
now

the
first
time
and
now
i
can
speak
oswald
rising
mother

do
understand
you

to
go
alving

shall
know
the
whole
truth

out
through
the
garden
door
manders
comes
in
from
the
hall
is
not
alving
here
regina
she
has
just
gone
down
the
garden
manders
this
is
the
most
terrible
night
i
ever
went
through
regina
yes
is
it
a
dreadful
misfortune
sir
manders
oh
do
talk
about
it
i
can
hardly
bear
to
think
of
it
regina
how
can
it
have
happened
manders
do
ask
me
miss
engstrand
how
should
know
do
you
too
is
it
not
enough
that
your
father
regina
what
about
him
manders
oh
he
has
driven
me
distracted
engstrand
enters
through
the
hall
your
reverence
manders
turns
round
in
terror
are
you
after
me
here
too
engstrand
yes
strike
me
dead
but
i
must
oh
lord
what
am
i
saying
but
this
is
a
terrible
ugly
business
your
reverence
manders
walks
to
and
fro
alas
alas
regina
what
the
matter
engstrand
why
it
all
came
of
this
here
you
see
softly
the
bird
limed
my
girl
aloud
and
to
think
it
should
be
my
doing
that
such
a
thing
should
be
his
reverence
doing
manders
but
i
assure
you
engstrand
engstrand
there
was
another
soul
except
your
reverence
as
ever
laid
a
finger
on
the
candles
down
there
manders
stops
so
you
declare
but
i
certainly
can
not
recollect
that
i
ever
had
a
candle
in
my
hand
engstrand
and
i
saw
as
clear
as
daylight
how
your
reverence
took
the
candle
and
snuffed
it
with
your
fingers
and
threw
away
the
snuff
among
the
shavings
manders
and
you
stood
and
looked
on
engstrand
yes
i
saw
it
as
plain
as
a
i
did
manders
it
quite
beyond
my
comprehension
besides
it
has
never
been
my
habit
to
snuff
candles
with
my
fingers
engstrand
and
terrible
risky
it
looked
too
that
it
did
but
is
there
such
a
deal
of
harm
done
after
all
your
reverence
manders
walks
restlessly
to
and
fro
oh
do
ask
me
engstrand
walks
with
him
and
your
reverence
had
insured
it
neither
manders
continuing
to
walk
up
and
down
no
no
no
i
have
told
you
so
engstrand
following
him
not
insured
and
then
to
go
straight
away
down
and
set
light
to
the
whole
thing
lord
lord
what
a
misfortune
manders
wipes
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
ay
you
may
well
say
that
engstrand
engstrand
and
to
think
that
such
a
thing
should
happen
to
a
benevolent
institution
that
was
to
have
been
a
blessing
both
to
town
and
country
as
the
saying
goes
the
newspapers
wo
be
for
handling
your
reverence
very
gently
i
expect
manders
no
that
is
just
what
i
am
thinking
of
that
is
almost
the
worst
of
the
whole
matter
all
the
malignant
attacks
and
imputations
oh
it
makes
me
shudder
to
think
of
it
alving
comes
in
from
the
garden
he
is
not
to
be
persuaded
to
leave
the
fire
manders
ah
there
you
are
alving
alving
so
you
have
escaped
your
inaugural
address
pastor
manders
manders
oh
i
should
so
gladly
alving
in
an
undertone
it
is
all
for
the
best
that
orphanage
would
have
done
no
one
any
good
manders
do
you
think
not
alving
do
you
think
it
would
manders
it
is
a
terrible
misfortune
all
the
same
alving
let
us
speak
of
it
plainly
as
a
matter
of
are
you
waiting
for
manders
engstrand
engstrand
at
the
hall
door
that
just
what
i
of
alving
then
sit
down
meanwhile
engstrand
thank
you
i
as
soon
stand
alving
to
manders
i
suppose
you
are
going
by
the
steamer
manders
yes
it
starts
in
an
hour
alving
then
be
so
good
as
to
take
all
the
papers
with
you
i
hear
another
word
about
this
affair
i
have
other
things
to
think
of
manders
alving
alving
later
on
i
shall
send
you
a
power
of
attorney
to
settle
everything
as
you
please
manders
that
i
will
very
readily
undertake
the
original
destination
of
the
endowment
must
now
be
completely
changed
alas
alving
of
course
it
must
manders
i
think
first
of
all
i
shall
arrange
that
the
solvik
property
shall
pass
to
the
parish
the
land
is
by
no
means
without
value
it
can
always
be
turned
to
account
for
some
purpose
or
other
and
the
interest
of
the
money
in
the
bank
i
could
perhaps
best
apply
for
the
benefit
of
some
undertaking
of
acknowledged
value
to
the
town
alving
do
just
as
you
please
the
whole
matter
is
now
completely
indifferent
to
me
engstrand
give
a
thought
to
my
sailors
home
your
reverence
manders
upon
my
word
that
is
not
a
bad
suggestion
that
must
be
considered
engstrand
oh
devil
take
considering
lord
forgive
me
manders
with
a
sigh
and
unfortunately
i
can
not
tell
how
long
i
shall
be
able
to
retain
control
of
these
things
whether
public
opinion
may
not
compel
me
to
retire
it
entirely
depends
upon
the
result
of
the
official
inquiry
into
the
fire
alving
what
are
you
talking
about
manders
and
the
result
can
by
no
means
be
foretold
engstrand
comes
close
to
him
ay
but
it
can
though
for
here
stands
old
jacob
engstrand
manders
well
well
but
engstrand
more
softy
and
jacob
engstrand
is
the
man
to
desert
a
noble
benefactor
in
the
hour
of
need
as
the
saying
goes
manders
yes
but
my
good
fellow
how
engstrand
jacob
engstrand
may
be
likened
to
a
sort
of
a
guardian
angel
he
may
your
reverence
manders
no
no
i
really
can
not
accept
that
engstrand
oh
that
be
the
way
of
it
all
the
same
i
know
a
man
as
has
taken
others
sins
upon
himself
before
now
i
do
manders
jacob
wrings
his
hand
yours
is
a
rare
nature
well
you
shall
be
helped
with
your
sailors
home
that
you
may
rely
upon
engstrand
tries
to
thank
him
but
can
not
for
emotion
manders
hangs
his
over
his
shoulder
and
now
let
us
set
out
we
two
will
go
together
engstrand
at
the
door
softly
to
regina
you
come
along
too
my
lass
you
shall
live
as
snug
as
the
yolk
in
an
egg
regina
tosses
her
head
she
goes
out
into
the
hall
and
fetches
manders
overcoat
manders
alving
and
may
the
spirit
of
law
and
order
descend
upon
this
house
and
that
quickly
alving
pastor
manders
she
goes
up
towards
the
conservatory
as
she
sees
oswald
coming
in
through
the
garden
door
engstrand
while
he
and
regina
help
manders
to
get
his
coat
on
my
child
and
if
any
trouble
should
come
to
you
you
know
where
jacob
engstrand
is
to
be
found
softly
little
harbour
street
h
to
alving
and
oswald
and
the
refuge
for
wandering
mariners
shall
be
called
chamberlain
alving
home
that
it
shall
and
if
so
be
as
i
spared
to
carry
on
that
house
in
my
own
way
i
make
so
bold
as
to
promise
that
it
shall
be
worthy
of
the
chamberlain
memory
manders
in
the
doorway
h
h
come
along
my
dear
engstrand
he
and
engstrand
go
out
through
the
hall
oswald
goes
towards
the
table

house

he
talking
about
alving
oh
a
kind
of
home
that
he
and
pastor
manders
want
to
set
up
oswald
it
will
burn
down
like
the
other
alving
what
makes
you
think
so
oswald
everything
will
burn
all
that
recalls
father
memory
is
doomed
here
am
i
too
burning
down
regina
starts
and
looks
at
him
alving
oswald
you
ought
to
have
remained
so
long
down
there
my
poor
boy
oswald
sits
down
by
the
table
i
almost
think
you
are
right
alving
let
me
dry
your
face
oswald

are
quite
wet
she
dries
his
face
with
her
oswald
stares
indifferently
in
front
of
him
thanks

you
not
tired
oswald
should
you
like
to
sleep
oswald
nervously
no
no
not
to
sleep
i
never
sleep
i
only
pretend
to
sadly
that
will
come
soon
enough
alving
looking
sorrowfully
at
him
yes
you
really
are
ill
my
blessed
boy
regina
eagerly
is
alving
ill
oswald
impatiently
oh

shut
all
the
doors
this
killing
dread
alving
close

doors
regina
regina
shuts
them
and
remains
standing
by
the
hall
door
alving
takes
her
shawl
off
regina
does
the
same
alving
draws
a
chair
across
to
oswald
and
sits
by
him
alving
there
now
i
am
going
to
sit
beside
you
oswald

regina

stay
here
too

be
with
me

to
the
rescue

do
understand

the
rescue

need

you
not
your
mother
to
come
to
the
rescue
oswald
you
smiles
no
mother
that
rescue
you
will
never
bring
me
laughs
sadly
you
ha
ha
looks
earnestly
at
her
though
after
all
who
ought
to
do
it
if
not
you
impetuously
why
ca
you
say
thou
to
me
regina
note
sige
du
fr
why
do
you
call
me
oswald
regina
softly
i
do
think
alving
would
like
it
alving
you
shall
have
leave
to
presently
and
meanwhile
sit
over
here
beside
us
regina
seats
herself
demurely
and
hesitatingly
at
the
other
side
of
the
table
alving
and
now
my
poor
suffering
boy
i
am
going
to
take
the
burden
off
your
mind
oswald
you
mother
mrs
all
the
gnawing
remorse
and
you
speak
of
oswald
and
you
think
you
can
do
that
alving
yes
now
i
can
oswald
a
little
while
ago
you
spoke
of
the
joy
of
life
and
at
that
word
a
new
light
burst
for
me
over
my
life
and
everything
connected
with
it
oswald
shakes
his
head
i
do
understand
you
alving
you
ought
to
have
known
your
father
when
he
was
a
young
lieutenant
he
was
brimming
over
with
the
joy
of
life
oswald
yes
i
know
he
was
alving
it
was
like
a
breezy
day
only
to
look
at
him
and
what
exuberant
strength
and
vitality
there
was
in
him
oswald
well
alving
well
then
child
of
joy
as
he
was
for
he
was
like
a
child
in
those
days
he
had
to
live
at
home
here
in
a
town
which
had
no
joys
to
offer
him
only
dissipations
he
had
no
object
in
life
only
an
official
position
he
had
no
work
into
which
he
could
throw
himself
heart
and
soul
he
had
only
business
he
had
not
a
single
comrade
that
could
realise
what
the
joy
of
life
meant
only
loungers
and
oswald
mother
alving
so
the
inevitable
happened
oswald
the
inevitable
alving
you
told
me
yourself
this
evening
what
would
become
of
you
if
you
stayed
at
home
oswald
do
you
mean
to
say
that
father
alving
your
poor
father
found
no
outlet
for
the
overpowering
joy
of
life
that
was
in
him
and
i
brought
no
brightness
into
his
home
oswald
not
even
you
alving
they
had
taught
me
a
great
deal
about
duties
and
so
forth
which
i
went
on
obstinately
believing
in
everything
was
marked
out
into
duties
into
my
duties
and
his
duties
and
i
am
afraid
i
made
his
home
intolerable
for
your
poor
father
oswald
oswald
why
have
you
never
spoken
of
this
in
writing
to
me
alving
i
have
never
before
seen
it
in
such
a
light
that
i
could
speak
of
it
to
you
his
son
oswald
in
what
light
did
you
see
it
then
alving
slowly
i
saw
only
this
one
thing
that
your
father
was
a
man
before
you
were
born
oswald
softly
ah
he
rises
and
walks
away
to
the
window
alving
and
then
day
after
day
i
dwelt
on
the
one
thought
that
by
rights
regina
should
be
at
home
in
this
house
just
like
my
own
boy
oswald
turning
round
quickly
regina
regina
springs
up
and
asks
with
bated
breath
i
alving
yes
now
you
know
it
both
of
you
oswald
regina
regina
to
herself
so
mother
was
that
kind
of
woman
alving
your
mother
had
many
good
qualities
regina
regina
yes
but
she
was
one
of
that
sort
all
the
same
oh
i
often
suspected
it
but
and
now
if
you
please
may
i
be
allowed
to
go
away
at
once
alving
do
you
really
wish
it
regina
regina
yes
indeed
i
do
alving
of
course
you
can
do
as
you
like
but
oswald
goes
towards
regina
go
away
now
your
place
is
here
regina
mr
alving
or
now
i
suppose
i
may
say
oswald
but
i
can
tell
you
this
was
at
all
what
i
expected
alving
regina
i
have
not
been
frank
with
you
regina
no
that
you
have
indeed
if
i
known
that
oswald
was
an
invalid
why
and
now
too
that
it
can
never
come
to
anything
serious
between
us
i
really
ca
stop
out
here
in
the
country
and
wear
myself
out
nursing
sick
people
oswald
not
even
one
who
is
so
near
to
you
regina
no
that
i
ca
a
poor
girl
must
make
the
best
of
her
young
days
or
she
be
left
out
in
the
cold
before
she
knows
where
she
is
and
i
too
have
the
joy
of
life
in
me
alving
alving
unfortunately
you
leave
but
do
throw
yourself
away
regina
regina
oh
what
must
be
must
be
if
oswald
takes
after
his
father
i
take
after
my
mother
i
may
i
ask
if
pastor
manders
knows
all
this
about
me
alving
pastor
manders
knows
all
about
it
regina
busied
in
putting
on
her
shawl
well
then
i
better
make
haste
and
get
away
by
this
steamer
the
pastor
is
such
a
nice
man
to
deal
with
and
i
certainly
think
i
as
much
right
to
a
little
of
that
money
as
he
has
that
brute
of
a
carpenter
alving
you
are
heartily
welcome
to
it
regina
regina
looks
hard
at
her
i
think
you
might
have
brought
me
up
as
a
gentleman
daughter
it
would
have
suited
me
better
tosses
her
head
but
pooh
what
does
it
matter
with
a
bitter
side
glance
at
the
corked
bottle
i
may
come
to
drink
champagne
with
gentlefolks
yet
alving
and
if
you
ever
need
a
home
regina
come
to
me
regina
no
thank
you
pastor
manders
will
look
after
me
i
know
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
know
of
one
house
where
every
right
to
a
place
alving
where
is
that
regina
chamberlain
alving
home
alving
regina
now
i
see
it
you
are
going
to
your
ruin
regina
oh
stuff
she
nods
and
goes
out
through
the
hall
oswald
stands
at
the
window
and
looks
out
is
she
gone
alving
yes
oswald
murmuring
aside
to
himself
i
think
it
was
a
mistake
this
alving
goes
up
behind
him
and
lays
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
oswald
my
dear
boy
has
it
shaken
you
very
much
oswald
turns
his
face
towards
her
all
that
about
father
do
you
mean
alving
yes
about
your
unhappy
father
i
am
so
afraid
it
may
have
been
too
much
for
you
oswald
why
should
you
fancy
that
of
course
it
came
upon
me
as
a
great
surprise
but
it
can
make
no
real
difference
to
me
alving
draws
her
hands
away
no
difference
that
your
father
was
so
infinitely
unhappy
oswald
of
course
i
can
pity
him
as
i
would
anybody
else
but
alving
nothing
more
your
own
father
oswald
impatiently
oh
father
father
i
never
knew
anything
of
father
i
remember
nothing
about
him
except
that
he
once
made
me
sick
alving
this
is
terrible
to
think
of
ought
not
a
son
to
love
his
father
whatever
happens
oswald
when
a
son
has
nothing
to
thank
his
father
for
has
never
known
him
do
you
really
cling
to
that
old
superstition
you
who
are
so
enlightened
in
other
ways
alving
can
it
be
only
a
superstition
oswald
yes
surely
you
can
see
that
mother
it
one
of
those
notions
that
are
current
in
the
world
and
so
alving
deeply
moved
ghosts
oswald
crossing
the
room
yes
you
may
call
them
ghosts
alving
wildly
oswald
then
you
do
love
me
either
oswald
you
i
know
at
any
rate
alving
yes
you
know
me
but
is
that
all
oswald
and
of
course
i
know
how
fond
you
are
of
me
and
i
ca
but
be
grateful
to
you
and
then
you
can
be
so
useful
to
me
now
that
i
am
alving
yes
can
not
i
oswald
oh
i
could
almost
bless
the
illness
that
has
driven
you
home
to
me
for
i
see
very
plainly
that
you
are
not
mine
i
have
to
win
you
oswald
impatiently
yes
yes
yes
all
these
are
just
so
many
phrases
you
must
remember
that
i
am
a
sick
man
mother
i
ca
be
much
taken
up
with
other
people
i
have
enough
to
do
thinking
about
myself
alving
in
a
low
voice
i
shall
be
patient
and
easily
satisfied
oswald
and
cheerful
too
mother
alving
yes
my
dear
boy
you
are
quite
right
goes
towards
him
have
i
relieved
you
of
all
remorse
and
now
oswald
yes
you
have
but
now
who
will
relieve
me
of
the
dread
alving
the
dread
oswald
walks
across
the
room
regina
could
have
been
got
to
do
it
alving
i
do
understand
you
what
is
this
about
dread
and
regina
oswald
is
it
very
late
mother
alving
it
is
early
morning
she
looks
out
through
the
conservatory
the
day
is
dawning
over
the
mountains
and
the
weather
is
clearing
oswald
in
a
little
while
you
shall
see
the
sun
oswald
i
glad
of
that
oh
i
may
still
have
much
to
rejoice
in
and
live
for
alving
i
should
think
so
indeed
oswald
even
if
i
ca
work
alving
oh
you
soon
be
able
to
work
again
my
dear
boy
now
that
you
have
got
all
those
gnawing
and
depressing
thoughts
to
brood
over
any
longer
oswald
yes
i
glad
you
were
able
to
rid
me
of
all
those
fancies
and
when
i
got
over
this
one
thing
more
sits
on
the
sofa
now
we
will
have
a
little
talk
mother
alving
yes
let
us
she
pushes
an
towards
the
sofa
and
sits
down
close
to
him
oswald
and
meantime
the
sun
will
be
rising
and
then
you
will
know
all
and
then
i
shall
not
feel
this
dread
any
longer
alving
what
is
it
that
i
am
to
know
oswald
not
listening
to
her
mother
did
you
not
say
a
little
while
ago
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
you
would
not
do
for
me
if
i
asked
you
alving
yes
indeed
i
said
so
oswald
and
you
stick
to
it
mother
alving
you
may
rely
on
that
my
dear
and
only
boy
i
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
live
for
but
you
alone
oswald
very
well
then
now
you
shall
hear
mother
you
have
a
strong
steadfast
mind
i
know
now
you
to
sit
quite
still
when
you
hear
it
alving
what
dreadful
thing
can
it
be
oswald
you
not
to
scream
out
do
you
hear
do
you
promise
me
that
we
will
sit
and
talk
about
it
quietly
do
you
promise
me
mother
alving
yes
yes
i
promise
only
speak
oswald
well
you
must
know
that
all
this
fatigue
and
my
inability
to
think
of
work
all
that
is
not
the
illness
itself
alving
then
what
is
the
illness
itself
oswald
the
disease
i
have
as
my
birthright
he
points
to
his
forehead
and
adds
very
softly
is
seated
here
alving
almost
voiceless
oswald
no
no
oswald
do
scream
i
ca
bear
it
yes
mother
it
is
seated
here
waiting
and
it
may
break
out
any
day
at
any
moment
alving
oh
what
horror
oswald
now
quiet
quiet
that
is
how
it
stands
with
me
alving
springs
up
it
not
true
oswald
it
impossible
it
can
not
be
so
oswald
i
have
had
one
attack
down
there
already
it
was
soon
over
but
when
i
came
to
know
the
state
i
had
been
in
then
the
dread
descended
upon
me
raging
and
ravening
and
so
i
set
off
home
to
you
as
fast
as
i
could
alving
then
this
is
the
dread
oswald
yes
it
so
indescribably
loathsome
you
know
oh
if
it
had
only
been
an
ordinary
mortal
disease
for
i
not
so
afraid
of
death
though
i
should
like
to
live
as
long
as
i
can
alving
yes
yes
oswald
you
must
oswald
but
this
is
so
unutterably
loathsome
to
become
a
little
baby
again
to
have
to
be
fed
to
have
to
oh
it
not
to
be
spoken
of
alving
the
child
has
his
mother
to
nurse
him
oswald
springs
up
no
never
that
that
is
just
what
i
will
not
have
i
ca
endure
to
think
that
perhaps
i
should
lie
in
that
state
for
many
years
and
get
old
and
grey
and
in
the
meantime
you
might
die
and
leave
me
sits
in
alving
chair
for
the
doctor
said
it
necessarily
prove
fatal
at
once
he
called
it
a
sort
of
softening
of
the
brain
or
something
like
that
smiles
sadly
i
think
that
expression
sounds
so
nice
it
always
sets
me
thinking
of
velvet
something
soft
and
delicate
to
stroke
alving
shrieks
oswald
oswald
springs
up
and
paces
the
room
and
now
you
have
taken
regina
from
me
if
i
could
only
have
had
her
she
would
have
come
to
the
rescue
i
know
alving
goes
to
him
what
do
you
mean
by
that
my
darling
boy
is
there
any
help
in
the
world
that
i
would
not
give
you
oswald
when
i
got
over
my
attack
in
paris
the
doctor
told
me
that
when
it
comes
again
and
it
will
come
there
will
be
no
more
hope
alving
he
was
heartless
enough
to
oswald
i
demanded
it
of
him
i
told
him
i
had
preparations
to
make
he
smiles
cunningly
and
so
i
had
he
takes
a
little
box
from
his
inner
breast
pocket
and
opens
it
mother
do
you
see
this
alving

is
it
oswald

he
hides
the
box
again
in
his
pocket
alving
i
shall
never
survive
this
oswald
it
must
be
survived
now
if
i
had
regina
here
i
should
have
told
her
how
things
stood
with
me
and
begged
her
to
come
to
the
rescue
at
the
last
she
would
have
done
it
i
know
she
would
alving
never
oswald
when
the
horror
had
come
upon
me
and
she
saw
me
lying
there
helpless
like
a
little
baby
impotent
lost
hopeless
past
all
saving
alving
never
in
all
the
world
would
regina
have
done
this
oswald
regina
would
have
done
it
regina
was
so
splendidly
and
she
would
soon
have
wearied
of
nursing
an
invalid
like
me
alving
then
heaven
be
praised
that
regina
is
not
here
oswald
well
then
it
is
you
that

come
to
the
rescue
