this
little
book
is
not
supposed
to
contain
any
new
information
it
is
made
up
of
plain
observations
concerning
people
who
live
just
around
the
corner
if
the
reader
will
bear
in
mind
that
the
people
who
live
around
the
corner
are
discussed
in
this
volume
there
will
be
no
chance
for
painful
misunderstandings
i
have
no
desire
to
rub
the
wrong
way
anyone
who
proves
his
true
friendship
by
purchasing
a
copy
of
this
work
it
may
be
advisable
to
explain
that
these
fables
are
written
in
the
colloquial
american
language
the
vocabulary
employed
is
one
that
has
become
familiar
to
the
ear
although
it
is
seldom
seen
on
the
printed
page
in
other
words
this
volume
contains
a
shameless
amount
of
slang
if
any
part
of
it
is
unintelligible
to
the
reader
he
should
be
glad
that
he
has
escaped
what
seems
to
be
an
epidemic

how
an
humble

then

they
had
laid
out
for
their
vacation
the

and
the
three
periodical
souse
the
feeling
and
the
ride
on
the
sprinkling
once
there
was
an
indian
who
had
a
way
of
putting
on
all
his
feathers
and
breaking
out
of
the
reservation
for
three
weeks
at
a
stretch
he
gave
a
correct
imitation
of
the
shining
light
who
passes
the
basket
and
superintends
the
repairs
on
the
parsonage
he
was
entitled
to
a
mark
of
for
deportment
with
his
meals
he
drank
a
little
polly
after
dinner
he
smoked
one
perfecto
and
then
when
he
had
put
in
a
frolicsome
hour
or
so
with
the
north
american
review
he
crawled
into
the
hay
at
at
last
he
accumulated
a
sense
of
virtue
that
was
hard
to
carry
around
he
was
proud
of
himself
when
he
counted
up
the
number
of
days
during
which
he
had
stuck
to
the
straight
and
narrow
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
deserved
a
reward
so
he
decided
to
buy
himself
a
little
present
something
costing
about
cents
he
picked
out
a
place
where
they
had
electric
fans
and
pictures
by
the
old
masters
he
poured
out
a
size
the
kind
that
makes
the
barkeep
stop
wiping
up
and
look
unfriendly
for
a
moment
or
two
then
he
remembered
that
a
bird
can
not
fly
with
one
wing
so
he
gently
raised
the
index
finger
and
gave
the
prescription
clerk
a
look
which
in
the
sign
language
means
repeat
the
dose
it
is
an
historical
fact
that
when
a
man
falls
backward
from
the
water
wagon
he
always
lands
in
a
crowd
the
full
stage
setting
the
light
effects
and
the
red
fire
were
all
ready
to
make
it
a
spectacular
affair
just
after
he
had
mowed
away
no
and
had
stopped
worrying
about
the
winter
coal
he
began
to
meet
friends
who
were
dying
of
thirst
then
the
atmosphere
began
to
be
curdled
with
high
balls
and
plymouth
sours
and
mint
smashes
and
he
was
telling
a
shoe
drummer
that
a
lot
of
people
who
had
been
knocking
him
would
probably
be
working
for
him
before
the
year
was
out
illustration
three
then
he
found
himself
in
a
cablet
and
the
sea
became
very
rough
there
was
something
out
of
whack
with
the
steering
gear
for
instead
of
bringing
up
at
his
boarding
house
he
found
himself
at
another
rum
parlor
the
man
who
owned
the
place
had
lost
the
key
and
could
not
lock
up
here
he
met
several
delegates
to
a
state
convention
of
a
fraternal
order
having
for
its
purpose
the
uplifting
of
mankind
they
wore
blue
badges
and
were
fighting
to
get
their
money
into
the
cash
register
in
a
little
while
he
and
a
delegate
were
up
by
the
cigar
counter
singing
how
can
i
bear
to
leave
thee
he
put
in
an
application
for
membership
and
then
the
next
picture
that
came
out
of
the
fog
was
a
chop
suey
restaurant
and
everybody
breaking
dishes
illustration
soon
after
the
lights
went
out
and
when
he
came
back
to
earth
he
was
lying
the
wrong
way
of
his
bed
with
blue
badges
all
over
him
trying
to
swallow
a
bath
towel
which
he
afterward
discovered
was
his
tongue
by
getting
a
leverage
under
his
head
he
managed
to
pry
it
up
and
then
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
called
himself
names
he
had
nothing
left
over
except
the
cards
given
to
him
by
the
brothers
from
up
state
somewhere
he
had
a
dim
and
sneaking
recollection
that
he
had
given
his
address
and
phone
number
to
the
whole
tribe
and
begged
them
to
look
him
up
not
any
more
in
mine
said
he
as
he
held
a
towel
under
the
faucet
not
for
all
of
morgan
would
i
look
at
any
more
of
that
essence
of
trouble
i
wonder
if
i
live
through
the
morning
that
day
he
lived
on
bromo
and
ice
and
the
only
satisfaction
this
life
offered
was
the
fact
that
he
was
a
reformed
man
on
the
second
day
he
could
look
at
solid
food
without
having
a
spasm
his
hair
stopped
pulling
and
he
began
to
speak
to
the
people
he
met
when
asked
to
step
out
for
a
little
while
he
lost
his
temper
and
made
a
little
talk
on
the
subject
proving
conclusively
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
illustration
again
as
he
walked
homeward
in
the
dusk
he
passed
the
clubs
and
caf√©s
where
those
who
drank
were
rounding
up
and
he
felt
sorry
for
them
why
ca
they
pass
it
up
the
same
as
i
do
he
asked
himself
ah
if
only
they
knew
how
much
more
fun
it
is
to
be
respectable
it
was
an
actual
mystery
to
him
that
any
one
could
dally
with
a
dry
martini
while
there
was
a
hydrant
on
every
corner
on
the
third
day
he
was
cracking
his
whip
and
begging
people
to
get
up
on
the
wagon
with
him
and
he
said
it
was
a
queer
thing
but
he
could
bear
the
sight
of
it
while
on
the
fourth
evening
he
confessed
to
some
nice
people
he
met
at
a
church
social
that
at
one
time
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
coaxed
into
taking
an
occasional
nip
but
he
reasoned
it
all
out
and
decided
it
was
a
bad
thing
and
simply
chopped
it
right
off
they
told
him
it
was
wonderful
how
much
will
power
he
had
and
asked
him
if
he
ever
felt
the
old
craving
coming
back
on
him
and
he
said
he
could
see
it
splashing
all
around
him
and
not
have
the
faintest
desire
to
dip
in
he
was
so
stuck
on
himself
that
he
went
around
to
call
on
all
his
friends
who
kept
it
on
the
table
so
that
he
could
wave
it
to
one
side
and
tell
how
he
despised
it
he
sat
there
and
pitied
those
who
were
inhaling
it
every
morning
when
he
arose
he
would
throw
kisses
to
himself
in
the
glass
and
exclaim
aha
the
head
as
clear
as
a
bell
this
i
bet
i
the
cleanest
and
nicest
young
fellow
in
this
town
any
girl
that
picks
out
a
sober
and
steady
man
such
as
i
am
will
certainly
be
showing
good
judgment
as
narrated
at
the
beginning
for
three
weeks
he
worked
hard
at
the
job
of
being
an
abstainer
and
at
last
he
accumulated
a
sense
of
virtue
that
weighed
over
pounds
he
knew
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
reward
so
he
decided
to
buy
himself
a
little
present
just
a
wee
reminder
of
days
and
then
back
to
sarsaparilla
but
he
fell
into
a
crowd
there
was
another
state
convention
it
had
been
arranged
for
him
so
that
he
could
get
a
fresh
start
moral
life
is
a
series
of
relapses
and
recoveries
kind
of
music
that
is
too
good
for
household
one
evening
a
little
flock
of
our
best
people
got
together
at
the
home
of
a
lady
who
invariably
was
first
over
the
fence
in
the
mad
pursuit
of
culture
she
loved
to
fill
her
front
rooms
with
folks
who
wore
hats
and
read
norwegian
novels
that
no
one
else
ever
heard
anything
about
on
the
evening
already
mentioned
she
had
a
cluster
of
geniuses
on
hand
they
were
expected
to
talk
for
a
couple
of
hours
so
as
to
work
up
an
appetite
for
neapolitan
and
in
the
course
of
time
they
got
around
to
the
topic
of
modern
music
all
agreed
that
the
music
which
seemed
to
catch
on
with
the
public
was
exceedingly
punk
they
rather
fancied
parsifal
and
were
willing
to
concede
that
vogner
made
good
in
spots
but
mascagni
they
branded
as
a
crab
as
for
victor
herbert
and
sousa
back
to
the
illustration
love
a
little
later
in
the
game
the
conversation
began
to
sag
and
it
was
suggested
that
they
have
something
on
the
piano
they
gathered
around
the
stack
of
music
and
then
vogner
went
into
the
discard
and
puccini
fell
to
the
floor
unnoticed
and
the
classics
did
not
get
a
hand
but
they
gave
a
yelp
of
joy
when
they
spotted
a
dear
little
cantata
about
a
coon
who
earned
a
razor
and
had
trouble
with
his
wife
they
sang
the
chorus
times
and
the
young
lady
wore
out
both
wrists
doing
moral
it
is
proper
to
enjoy
the
cheaper
grades
of
art
but
they
should
not
be
formally
indorsed
one
or
two
points
of
difference
between
learning
and
learning
in
a
red
back
in
the
district
it
was
the
custom
to
have
a
debate
every
friday
afternoon
the
question
as
to
which
does
the
greater
damage
fire
or
water
had
been
carefully
gone
over
by
the
squabs
also
who
was
the
heftier
proposition
napoleon
or
washington
but
the
original
was
as
follows
resolved
that
education
is
better
than
wealth
the
corporate
interests
got
many
a
whack
here
in
the
knowledge
works
most
of
the
children
wanted
to
grow
up
and
be
like
galileo
they
claimed
that
mere
wealth
could
not
purchase
happiness
the
only
genuine
peace
of
mind
came
from
being
able
to
call
off
the
geological
periods
with
the
eyes
closed
illustration
and
here
in
this
little
brain
hatchery
were
two
kids
who
were
not
mates
one
was
named
otis
and
the
other
was
bradford
or
brad
for
short
otis
was
the
boy
who
took
the
affirmative
side
on
friday
afternoon
ote
firmly
believed
that
learning
was
the
most
valuable
asset
that
a
man
could
tuck
away
brad
was
for
the
money
end
of
the
game
but
when
he
got
up
to
make
his
talk
his
vocabulary
would
become
jammed
up
and
caught
crossways
in
the
flue
and
teacher
would
motion
him
back
to
his
seat
otis
however
could
tell
in
phrases
why
the
scholar
was
a
better
and
happier
man
than
the
millionaire
and
so
he
always
received
the
vote
of
the
judges
now
brad
was
done
up
but
unconvinced
he
could
not
stand
up
before
the
district
school
and
tell
why
it
was
good
policy
to
corral
the
coin
but
he
had
a
secret
hunch
that
it
would
be
no
disgrace
for
him
to
go
out
and
do
the
best
he
could
brad
had
a
jaw
and
large
hands
and
a
somewhat
larger
than
his
he
jumped
the
stockade
when
they
started
to
teach
him
botany
he
weighed
and
he
thought
he
was
too
large
to
sit
around
and
count
the
petals
of
the
daisy
when
he
might
be
out
selling
lightning
rods
to
the
yaps
and
making
contracts
accordingly
he
dug
bradford
is
making
a
great
mistake
said
otis
as
he
saw
his
friend
tear
from
the
institution
of
learning
in
order
to
get
a
few
worldly
chattels
right
at
the
jump
he
sacrifices
his
diploma
i
shall
be
more
foxy
i
shall
go
right
on
through
the
high
school
and
then
i
shall
attend
college
and
get
a
degree
when
i
have
taken
my
degree
then
i
will
be
the
human
my
scholarly
attainments
and
polished
manner
will
get
me
past
the
door
and
into
the
inner
circle
of
the
hot
potatoes
as
for
bradford
although
it
is
possible
that
he
shall
have
combed
up
a
little
currency
he
will
be
a
mere
ordinary
sordid
business
man
not
when
he
tries
to
stack
up
against
one
who
has
just
been
delivered
of
a
thesis
on
the
correlated
phenomena
of
unconscious
cerebration
while
brad
was
out
in
the
back
townships
the
farmers
and
buying
per
cent
mortgages
otis
was
working
his
way
through
college
and
living
on
oatmeal
except
on
holidays
and
then
prunes
he
was
getting
and
wore
specs
and
was
all
gaunted
up
but
he
never
weakened
he
was
pulling
for
the
laurel
wreath
of
scholarship
or
in
other
words
the
degree
after
humping
it
for
years
he
passed
his
final
exam
and
the
faculty
decided
that
he
was
a
bachelor
of
arts
that
was
the
day
when
he
had
the
laugh
on
brad
in
the
meantime
bradford
had
been
choking
various
people
and
taking
it
away
from
them
he
had
four
salesmen
under
him
and
had
butted
into
the
firm
but
he
was
still
shy
on
botany
inasmuch
as
otis
had
been
one
of
the
brightest
men
in
his
class
he
was
offered
a
position
as
instructor
in
the
college
at
a
salary
of
a
month
with
a
promise
of
raise
at
the
end
of
five
years
if
he
lived
otis
accepted
because
the
outside
world
did
not
seem
to
be
clamoring
for
his
services
even
though
he
was
an
authority
on
the
mezozoic
period
and
knew
all
the
diatomes
by
their
first
names
illustration
often
while
he
was
burning
the
midnight
oil
and
grinding
out
so
as
to
qualify
for
the
master
degree
he
reflected
as
follows
it
is
true
that
brad
is
making
it
hand
over
fist
and
wears
shirts
and
rides
in
a
on
the
pullman
but
he
is
not
a
bachelor
of
arts
and
some
day
when
he
is
a
i
can
still
look
down
on
him
for
then
i
shall
be
a
master
of
arts
i
have
known
since
childhood
that
education
is
more
desirable
than
paltry
gold
although
the
newspapers
and
the
general
public
do
not
seem
to
be
with
me
to
any
extent
it
is
better
to
with
the
binomial
theorem
than
to
dally
with
the
champagne
supper
in
due
time
the
faculty
gave
the
degree
of
to
what
was
left
of
otis
and
still
his
ambition
was
not
satisfied
he
wanted
to
land
a
doctor
degree
he
knew
that
any
one
who
aspired
to
this
eminent
honor
had
to
be
a
pippin
but
he
hoped
that
he
could
make
some
contribution
to
the
world
of
thought
that
would
jar
the
whole
educational
system
and
help
him
to
climb
to
the
topmost
pinnacle
of
human
greatness
professor
otis
did
the
dig
act
year
after
year
at
the
age
of
he
was
still
and
owned
a
house
with
a
mortgage
on
it
in
the
meantime
there
had
been
revolutionary
changes
in
the
world
of
finance
everything
on
earth
had
been
put
into
a
pool
each
smooth
citizen
who
had
something
that
was
of
no
particular
use
to
him
went
to
work
and
capitalized
it
brad
closed
out
his
interests
for
so
much
money
that
any
one
else
would
have
been
ashamed
to
take
it
then
he
and
some
other
buccaneers
went
down
to
wall
street
to
have
fun
with
several
dignified
gentlemen
whom
brad
described
as
them
fly
eastern
mugs
they
succeeded
in
putting
the
skids
under
a
number
of
persons
who
did
not
care
to
meet
them
socially
when
brad
walked
around
in
his
million
dollar
hut
he
had
to
step
high
to
avoid
stumbling
over
bundles
of
the
long
green
but
he
never
had
made
any
further
headway
with
his
botany
it
happened
one
day
that
brad
was
out
moting
and
he
dropped
in
at
the
college
where
his
boyhood
friend
was
now
the
professor
of
dipsicology
and
plamazzus
this
is
a
plant
said
brad
as
he
sized
up
the
campus
i
like
to
encourage
these
joints
because
they
help
to
keep
a
lot
of
young
fellows
away
from
business
offices
i
find
that
i
have
here
in
my
a
measly
that
i
have
overlooked
in
changing
my
clothes
give
it
to
the
main
cheese
and
tell
him
to
have
a
laboratory
on
me
when
the
news
got
out
all
the
boys
gave
a
parade
in
their
nighties
the
faculty
called
a
special
meeting
and
made
brad
a
doctor
of
philosophy
next
year
he
put
up
for
a
gym
and
they
made
him
a
doctor
of
divinity
the
year
following
he
handed
them
a
telescope
and
became
an
illustration
every
time
he
coughed
he
was
made
some
new
kind
of
doctor
in
fact
for
a
man
with
a
hat
who
did
not
know
the
difference
between
the
pistil
and
the
stamen
he
was
the
most
learned
thing
in
seven
states
professor
otis
was
crowded
into
the
ditch
sometimes
he
wonders
which
of
the
two
has
the
nub
end
of
the
argument
that
started
in
the
red
moral
the
longest
way
around
is
the
shortest
way
to
the
university
degree
and
the
something
once
there
was
a
girl
named
florine
whose
folks
kept
close
tab
on
her
any
harold
who
presumed
to
keep
the
parlor
open
after
midnight
heard
low
voices
in
the
hallway
and
then
a
rap
on
the
door
if
florine
put
on
her
other
dress
and
went
to
a
hop
then
mother
would
sit
up
and
wait
for
her
and
was
the
outside
limit
consequently
florine
would
have
to
duck
on
the
festivities
just
when
everything
was
getting
good
furthermore
she
would
have
to
warn
escort
to
behave
himself
when
they
drew
near
the
house
nothing
doing
at
the
gate
she
would
say
warningly
it
dollars
to
dumplings
that
the
girl
detective
is
peeking
out
to
get
a
line
on
my
conduct
she
has
her
ear
to
the
ground
about
of
the
time
and
if
any
one
makes
a
move
then
mother
is
next
if
father
takes
a
drink
at
the
club
and
then
starts
homeward
on
a
fast
trolley
mother
knows
all
about
it
when
he
is
still
three
blocks
from
the
house
what
more
she
is
a
knowing
bird
and
ca
be
fooled
by
cloves
or
these
little
peppermint
the
only
time
when
mother
kisses
father
is
when
she
wants
to
catch
him
with
the
goods
look
out
this
is
our
corner
as
soon
as
they
had
landed
at
the
gate
little
florine
would
say
in
loud
clear
tones
that
would
carry
as
far
as
the
window
oh
gilblitz
i
have
had
a
most
charming
evening
and
i
wish
to
thank
you
most
heartily
whereupon
the
escort
standing
feet
away
with
his
concertina
hat
in
his
hand
and
the
face
in
the
moonlight
beaming
with
innocence
would
come
back
thusly
it
awfully
good
of
you
to
say
that
good
night
illustration
after
which
mother
was
supposed
to
believe
that
they
had
been
feet
apart
all
evening
but
mother
was
canny
and
up
to
snuff
with
a
memory
that
reached
back
at
least
years
these
little
plays
under
the
window
did
not
throw
her
off
for
any
part
of
a
minute
before
florine
turned
in
she
was
and
required
to
tell
with
whom
she
had
danced
and
why
and
how
often
and
what
he
said
occasionally
the
daughter
worked
the
mental
reservation
in
other
words
she
held
out
on
mother
she
said
that
she
had
sat
out
most
of
the
numbers
but
she
admitted
going
through
a
square
dance
with
the
young
man
who
passed
the
plate
at
the
episcopal
church
at
which
mother
would
wink
the
off
eye
and
murmur
is
that
so
with
the
loud
pedal
on
the
that
also
something
about
being
more
than
seven
one
of
florine
ancestors
on
mother
side
happened
to
be
on
earth
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
and
father
often
spoke
of
a
second
cousin
who
had
been
in
congress
until
the
district
tumbled
to
him
because
of
this
current
of
blue
blood
racing
in
her
veins
florine
was
supposed
to
be
a
trifle
classy
and
mother
was
always
afraid
that
she
might
get
on
the
family
escutcheon
therefore
florine
was
forbidden
to
work
up
a
calling
acquaintance
with
any
of
the
hoi
polloi
which
is
greek
for
according
to
mother
there
were
only
about
families
in
town
that
really
belonged
and
some
of
them
did
belong
enough
to
hurt
florine
found
herself
cut
out
of
many
a
good
time
because
the
chaperon
for
the
occasion
chanced
to
be
related
to
some
one
who
had
been
in
the
liquor
business
florine
was
up
against
it
ever
so
hard
she
had
to
go
out
in
the
grape
arbor
when
she
wanted
to
chew
gum
and
she
kept
her
reading
matter
under
the
mattress
nearly
every
bachelor
in
town
had
been
forbidden
the
premises
because
of
the
stories
that
were
going
around
the
kind
that
mother
approved
were
of
the
lilac
division
with
white
puff
ties
and
their
hair
glued
down
they
talked
about
choir
practice
and
sometimes
when
they
were
sufficiently
wrought
up
they
played
charades
the
only
chance
that
florine
had
to
mingle
with
the
popular
boys
was
to
go
down
town
in
the
afternoon
and
just
happen
to
meet
one
of
them
at
the
parlor
florine
learned
to
be
quite
a
happener
but
on
the
way
home
she
would
have
to
fix
up
a
few
jules
vernes
for
the
old
lady
in
the
watch
tower
mother
knew
that
it
did
take
hours
to
be
measured
for
a
shirt
waist
wait
until
i
get
married
florine
would
say
i
make
that
flyer
look
like
a
if
mother
does
let
up
on
me
learn
to
smoke
cigarettes
at
times
she
was
so
desperate
that
she
was
ready
to
join
a
troupe
or
elope
with
a
drummer
she
wanted
to
get
out
among
the
bright
lights
and
hear
the
band
play
and
she
knew
that
she
could
turn
and
break
furniture
and
play
along
after
midnight
until
she
had
become
a
respectable
married
woman
so
she
had
her
distress
signal
out
and
used
to
drop
very
broad
hints
when
she
was
chatting
with
the
lads
who
happened
to
be
in
the
resort
when
she
dropped
in
they
liked
florine
for
keeps
but
when
one
of
them
thought
of
clinching
with
old
the
family
sleuth
he
weakened
illustration
florine
would
have
remained
a
dead
card
if
she
had
not
gone
on
a
visit
to
a
neighboring
city
where
she
bumped
into
the
town
trifler
he
had
a
way
of
proposing
to
every
girl
the
first
time
he
met
her
it
always
seemed
to
him
such
a
cordial
for
a
budding
friendship
usually
the
girl
asked
for
time
and
then
the
two
of
them
would
fiddle
around
and
fuss
and
make
up
and
finally
send
back
all
the
letters
and
that
would
be
the
finish
florine
fooled
the
foxy
philander
the
moment
he
came
at
her
with
the
marriage
talk
she
took
a
firm
hold
and
said
you
on
get
your
license
morning
then
cut
all
the
telegraph
wires
and
burn
the
railroad
bridges
they
were
married
and
strange
as
it
may
appear
mother
immediately
resigned
her
job
as
policeman
and
said
thank
goodness
i
got
you
married
off
now
you
can
do
as
you
please
when
florine
found
that
she
could
do
as
she
pleased
she
discovered
that
there
was
very
much
of
anything
to
do
except
settle
down
after
about
seven
parties
she
expended
her
whole
stock
of
ginger
and
now
she
is
just
as
quiet
as
the
rest
of
us
moral
any
system
is
if
it
finally
works
out
attenuated
attorney
who
rang
in
the
associate
once
there
was
a
attorney
who
had
studied
until
he
was
bleary
around
the
eyes
and
as
lean
as
a
he
knew
the
law
from
soup
to
nuts
but
much
learning
had
put
him
a
little
bit
to
the
willies
and
his
size
was
against
him
he
lacked
bellows
he
was
an
inconspicuous
little
runt
when
he
stood
up
to
plead
he
came
a
trifle
higher
than
the
chair
of
the
pounds
he
carried
about
were
gray
matter
he
had
mental
merchandise
to
burn
but
no
way
of
delivering
it
when
there
was
a
rally
or
some
other
gabfest
on
the
bills
the
committee
never
asked
him
to
make
an
address
the
committee
wanted
a
who
could
move
the
leaves
on
a
tree
feet
distant
the
lawyer
could
write
great
stuff
that
would
charm
a
bird
out
of
a
tree
but
he
did
not
have
the
tubes
to
enable
him
to
spout
when
he
got
up
to
talk
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
hear
himself
the
juries
used
to
go
to
sleep
on
him
he
needed
a
megaphone
and
he
had
about
as
much
personal
magnetism
as
an
undertaker
assistant
the
runt
lost
many
a
case
because
he
could
not
bark
at
the
jury
and
pound
holes
in
a
table
his
briefs
had
been
greatly
admired
by
the
supreme
court
also
it
was
known
that
he
could
draw
up
a
contract
that
would
hold
water
but
as
a
pleader
he
was
a
pickerel
at
one
time
he
had
an
important
suit
on
hand
and
he
was
worried
for
he
was
opposed
by
a
couple
of
living
gas
engines
who
could
rare
up
and
down
in
front
of
a
yap
jury
for
further
orders
i
have
the
law
on
my
side
said
the
runt
now
if
i
were
only
with
a
thorax
i
could
swing
the
verdict
while
he
was
repining
in
came
a
friend
of
his
youth
named
jim
this
jim
was
a
he
was
as
big
as
the
side
of
a
house
he
had
a
voice
that
sounded
as
if
it
came
up
an
elevator
shaft
when
he
folded
his
arms
and
looked
solemn
he
was
a
colossal
picture
of
power
in
repose
he
wore
a
plug
hat
and
a
large
black
coat
nature
intended
him
for
the
senate
but
used
up
all
the
material
early
in
the
job
and
failed
to
stock
the
brain
cavity
jim
had
always
been
at
the
foot
of
the
class
in
school
at
the
age
of
he
spelled
sure
with
an
sh
and
sank
in
a
heap
when
he
tried
to
add
and
but
he
was
a
tall
success
as
a
book
pedler
because
he
learned
his
piece
and
the
pounds
of
dignified
superiority
did
the
rest
wherever
he
went
he
commanded
respect
he
could
go
into
a
strange
hotel
and
sit
down
at
the
breakfast
table
and
say
please
pass
the
syrup
in
a
tone
that
had
all
the
majestic
significance
of
an
official
utterance
he
would
sit
there
in
silent
meditation
those
who
sized
up
that
elephantine
form
and
noted
the
gravity
of
his
countenance
and
the
fluted
wrinkles
on
his
high
brow
imagined
that
he
was
pondering
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
as
a
matter
of
fact
jim
was
wondering
whether
he
would
take
ham
or
bacon
with
his
eggs
jim
had
the
bulk
and
the
front
as
long
as
he
held
to
a
napoleonic
silence
he
could
carry
out
the
bluff
little
boys
when
they
came
near
him
and
maiden
ladies
sighed
for
an
introduction
nothing
but
a
examination
would
have
shown
jim
up
in
his
true
light
the
midget
lawyer
looked
up
in
envy
at
his
mastodonic
acquaintance
and
sighed
if
i
could
combine
my
intellect
with
your
i
would
be
the
largest
dandelion
in
the
legal
pasture
he
said
then
a
happy
idea
struck
him
amidships
jim
i
want
you
to
be
my
associate
counsel
he
said
i
understand
of
course
that
you
do
not
know
the
difference
between
a
caveat
and
a
caviar
sandwich
but
as
long
as
you
keep
your
hair
combed
the
way
it
is
now
and
wear
that
thoughtful
expression
you
just
as
good
as
the
whole
choate
family
i
will
introduce
you
as
an
eminent
attorney
from
the
east
i
will
guard
the
law
points
and
you
will
sit
there
and
dismay
the
opposition
by
looking
wise
so
when
the
case
came
up
for
trial
the
runt
led
the
august
jim
into
the
court
room
and
introduced
him
as
associate
counsel
a
murmur
of
admiration
ran
throughout
the
assemblage
when
jim
showed
his
commanding
figure
a
law
book
under
his
arm
and
a
look
of
heavy
responsibility
on
his
face
old
atlas
who
carries
the
globe
on
his
shoulders
did
not
seem
to
be
in
it
with
this
grand
and
gloomy
stranger
for
two
hours
jim
had
been
rehearsing
his
speech
he
arose
your
honor
he
began
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
a
scared
silence
fell
upon
the
court
room
it
was
like
the
lower
octave
of
a
pipe
organ
your
honor
said
jim
we
are
ready
for
trial
the
musical
rumble
filled
the
spacious
room
and
went
echoing
through
the
corridors
the
sound
beat
out
through
the
open
windows
and
checked
traffic
in
the
street
it
sang
through
the
telegraph
wires
and
lifted
every
drooping
flag
illustration
the
jurors
turned
pale
and
began
to
quiver
opposing
counsel
were
as
white
as
a
sheet
their
mute
and
frightened
faces
seemed
to
ask
what
are
we
up
against
jim
sat
down
and
the
trial
got
under
way
whenever
jim
got
his
cue
he
arose
and
said
your
honor
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
quite
agree
with
my
learned
colleague
then
he
would
relapse
and
throw
on
a
socrates
frown
and
the
other
side
would
go
all
to
pieces
every
time
jim
cleared
his
throat
you
could
hear
a
pin
drop
there
was
no
getting
away
from
the
dominating
influence
of
the
master
mind
the
jury
was
out
only
minutes
when
the
verdict
was
rendered
the
runt
who
had
provided
everything
except
the
air
pressure
was
nearly
trampled
under
foot
in
the
general
rush
to
congratulate
the
distinguished
attorney
from
the
east
the
little
man
gathered
up
his
books
and
did
the
customary
slink
while
the
false
alarm
stood
in
awful
silence
and
permitted
the
judge
and
others
to
shake
him
by
the
hand
moral
an
associate
counsel
should
weigh
at
least
pounds
father
bumped
into
at
the
culture
a
domestic
team
had
a
boy
named
buchanan
who
refused
to
work
so
his
parents
decided
that
he
needed
a
college
education
after
he
got
that
he
could
enter
a
learned
profession
in
which
work
is

father
and
mother
of
buchanan
sent
to
the
college
for
a
bunk
catalogue
the
book
had
a
green
cover
and
it
was
full
of
information
it
said
that
the
necessary
expenses
counted
up

were

moment
they
arrived
they
were
expected
to
hit
the
mattress
at
while
smoking
was
forbidden
and
no
one
could
go
to
town
except
on
a
special
permit
this
is
just
the
place
for
buchanan
said
his
mother
it
will
be
such
a
comfort
to
know
that
son
is
in
his
room
every
evening
accordingly
buchanan
was
supplied
with
six
shirts
two
suits
of
everything
a
a
a
kit
and
a
flesh
brush
and
away
he
rode
to
the
halls
of
learning
he
wrote
back
that
he
was
but
determined
to
stick
out
because
he
realized
the
advantages
of
a
college
education
he
said
his
eyes
hurt
him
a
little
from
reading
at
night
and
he
had
to
buy
a
great
many
extra
books
but
otherwise
he
was
fine
and
fancy
love
to
all
and
start
a
little
currency
by
the
first
mail
after
buchanan
had
been
toiling
up
the
hill
of
knowledge
for
nearly
two
months
and
sending
hot
bulletins
back
to
the
old
folks
his
father
decided
to
visit
him
and
give
him
some
encouragement
the
poor
boy
must
be
lonesome
down
there
among
all
those
strangers
said
father
i
drop
in
on
him
and
brighten
him
up
so
father
landed
in
the
college
town
and
inquired
for
buchanan
but
no
one
had
heard
of
such
a
person
perhaps
you
mean
buck
said
a
pale
youth
with
an
ingrowing
hat
if
he
the
indian
you
want
to
see
i
show
you
where
he
hangs
out
the
proud
parent
was
steered
to
a
faded
boarding
house
and
found
himself
in
a
chamber
of
horrors
that
seemed
to
be
a
cross
between
a
and
a
turkish
corner
here
he
found
the
college
desperado
known
as
old
buck
attired
in
a
plunking
a
stingy
little
mandolin
and
smoking
a
cigarette
that
smelled
as
if
somebody
had
been
standing
too
close
to
the
stove
hello
guv
said
the
seeker
after
truth
wait
until
i
do
a
quick
change
and
we
go
out
and
get
a
few
lines
of
breakfast
breakfast
at
inquired
father
we
had
a
very
busy
night
explained
buchanan
the
sophomores
have
disputed
our
right
to
wear
red
neckties
so
last
night
we
captured
the
president
of
the
soph
class
tied
him
to
a
tree
and
beat
him
to
a
whisper
with
a
ball
bat
then
we
started
over
to
set
fire
to
the
main
building
and
we
were
attacked
by
a
gang
of
sophs
that
is
how
i
happened
to
get
this
bum
lamp
just
as
he
gave
me
the
knee
i
butted
him
in
the
solar
plexus
he
had
two
doctors
working
on
him
ever
since
and
now
the
freshies
are
going
to
give
me
a
supper
at
the
dutch
restaurant
night
and
there
is
some
talk
of
electing
me
class
poet
so
you
see
i
am
getting
along
fine
illustration
you
are
doing
great
work
for
a
mere
child
said
the
parent
if
you
keep
on
you
may
be
senator
some
day
but
tell
me
where
did
you
get
all
of
these
placards
and
other
articles
of
vertu
i
swiped
those
replied
the
collegian
in
order
to
be
a
real
varsity
devil
one
must
bring
home
a
few
souvenirs
every
night
he
goes
out
if
the
missionaries
did
it
it
would
be
called
looting
if
the
common
people
did
it
it
would
be
called
petit
larceny
but
with
us
it
is
merely
a
student
prank
i
understand
said
father
nothing
can
be
more
playful
than
to
nail
a
tombstone
and
use
it
for
a
would
you
like
to
look
around
the
institution
asked
buchanan
indeed
i
should
was
the
reply
although
i
have
been
denied
the
blessed
privileges
of
higher
education
i
love
to
get
into
an
atmosphere
of
intellectuality
and
meet
those
souls
who
are
above
the
sordid
considerations
of
workaday
commercialism
you
talk
like
a
bucket
of
ashes
said
the
undergraduate
i
not
going
to
put
you
up
against
any
profs
follow
me
and
i
fix
it
so
that
you
can
shake
hands
with
the
guy
that
eats
alive
take
you
over
to
the
corral
and
show
you
the
they
been
drinking
blood
all
morning
and
are
feeling
good
and
cagey
about
we
turn
them
out
into
the
arena
and
let
them
plow
up
the
turf
is
this
a
college
or
a
zoo
asked
the
parent
i
refer
to
the
squad
said
buchanan
we
keep
about
at
the
training
table
all
of
the
time
so
that
no
matter
how
many
are
killed
off
we
will
always
have
left
we
have
a
centre
rush
who
weighs
and
you
would
dent
him
with
a
hatchet
we
caught
him
in
the
woods
north
of
town
and
brought
him
down
here
he
is
taking
a
special
course
in
piano
music
two
hours
a
week
and
the
rest
of
the
time
he
is
throwing
substitutes
down
and
biting
them
on
the
arm
buchanan
and
his
trembling
parent
sat
at
the
edge
of
the
gridiron
and
watched
the
carnage
for
a
while
buchanan
explained
that
it
was
merely
friendly
practice
that
evening
the
son
said
father
you
can
stay
only
a
little
while
and
i
want
to
give
you
a
good
time
while
you
are
here
come
with
us
we
are
going
down
to
the
opera
house
to
put
a
show
on
the
bum
one
of
the
first
things
we
learn
at
college
is
to
kid
the
troupers
it
is
considered
great
sport
in
these
parts
then
if
any
one
gets
pinched
we
tear
down
the
jail
thereby
preserving
the
traditions
of
dear
old
alma
mater
does
the
faculty
permit
you
to
be
guilty
of
disorderly
conduct
asked
the
parent
illustration
any
one
who
goes
against
the
faculty
is
a
fink
replied
buchanan
we
travel
in
a
bunch
so
that
when
the
inquest
is
held
there
is
no
way
of
finding
out
just
who
it
was
that
landed
the
punch
anything
that
happens
in
a
college
town
is
an
act
of
providence
now
come
along
and
see
the
american
youth
at
play
they
found
their
way
to
the
temple
of
art
when
the
chemical
soubrette
started
in
to
sing
hello
central
give
me
heaven
they
gave
her
just
the
opposite
of
what
she
was
demanding
a
few
opera
chairs
were
pulled
up
by
the
roots
and
tossed
on
the
stage
merely
to
disconcert
the
artiste
when
the
house
policeman
came
he
was
hurled
feet
into
the
air
and
soon
after
that
the
show
broke
up
the
student
body
flocked
out
and
upset
a
trolley
car
and
then
they
went
homeward
in
the
moonlight
singing
sweet
memories
of
college
days
father
hat
was
caved
in
and
he
was
a
trifle
bewildered
but
he
managed
to
observe
that
the
boys
were
a
trifle
boisterous
when
they
got
a
fair
start
oh
yes
but
they
do
mean
anything
by
it
explained
buchanan
illustration
the
i
hope
they
will
explain
that
to
the
house
policeman
as
soon
as
they
get
him
to
the
hospital
said
the
parent
otherwise
he
might
misconstrue
their
motives
next
day
when
he
went
back
he
told
mother
not
to
worry
about
buchanan
as
he
seemed
to
have
a
full
and
sympathetic
grasp
on
the
true
inwardness
of
modern
educational
methods
moral
attend
to
the
remittances
and
son
will
do
the
rest
search
for
the
right
house
and
how
jump
had
her
annual
once
there
was
a
family
called
jump
that
had
sampled
every
ward
within
the
corporation
limits
the
jumps
did
a
caravan
specialty
every
time
the
frost
went
out
of
the
ground
when
the
sarsaparilla
ads
began
to
blossom
and
the
peach
crop
had
been
ruined
by
the
late
cold
snap
and
the
kids
were
batting
up
flies
in
the
lot
back
of
the
universalist
church
and
a
down
street
was
tearing
the
soul
out
of
trovatore
these
were
the
cues
for
jump
to
get
her
nose
into
the
air
and
begin
to
champ
at
the
bit
mother
was
a
from
away
back
she
claimed
to
be
an
invalid
eleven
months
out
of
the
year
and
took
nerve
medicine
that
cost
a
bottle
just
the
same
when
april
hove
into
view
and
dame
nature
began
to
stretch
herself
then
mother
put
on
her
short
skirt
and
a
pair
of
shoes
intended
for
a
man
and
did
a
tall
prance
she
was
good
for
hours
a
day
on
any
kind
of
pavements
with
her
reticule
loaded
full
of
to
let
clippings
she
from
street
to
street
every
time
she
struck
a
fresh
trail
she
broke
into
a
run
mother
was
looking
for
a
house
that
had
twice
as
many
closets
as
rooms
and
a
southern
exposure
on
all
four
sides
she
had
conned
herself
into
the
belief
that
some
day
she
would
run
down
a
queen
anne
shack
that
would
be
in
all
particulars
in
the
magazine
that
came
every
month
she
had
seen
these
of
palaces
that
can
be
put
up
for
if
you
steal
your
materials
she
had
gazed
at
the
bunco
illustration
of
the
swell
structure
with
bushy
trees
dotting
the
lawn
and
a
little
girl
rolling
a
hoop
along
the
cement
and
she
had
set
her
heart
on
that
kind
of
a
home
mother
loved
to
study
the
plans
and
count
the
and
figure
on
window
seats
and
what
kind
of
curtains
to
put
in
the
guest
chamber
illustration
every
spring
she
found
the
place
she
had
been
seeking
and
gave
a
grand
signal
for
the
whole
outfit
to
begin
packing
up
those
were
the
bright
vernal
days
when
jump
got
all
that
was
coming
to
him
jump
was
a
man
therefore
any
old
kind
of
a
hut
suited
him
for
eight
years
before
starting
on
his
continuous
tour
with
mother
he
had
roomed
over
a
drug
store
his
apartment
had
been
one
of
those
delectable
where
women
never
butted
in
to
hide
things
and
give
the
whole
place
a
soapy
smell
the
sweepings
went
under
the
bed
so
as
not
to
litter
up
the
hallway
once
a
year
he
had
a
that
is
to
say
he
employed
a
colored
man
to
beat
the
rugs
which
had
to
be
separated
from
the
floor
by
means
of
a
shovel
inasmuch
as
women
never
came
in
to
straighten
up
he
knew
where
to
find
everything
he
knew
it
was
somewhere
in
the
room
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
excavate
until
he
found
it
then
he
hooked
up
with
laura
so
as
to
get
a
real
home
and
she
gave
him
a
new
one
every
year
jump
soon
discovered
that
although
every
man
is
the
architect
of
his
own
fortune
the
wife
usually
superintends
the
construction
when
jump
made
her
spring
announcement
that
they
would
move
to
another
house
he
did
a
deal
of
kicking
but
he
always
went
into
the
wood
shed
to
do
it
he
sassed
her
inwardly
but
not
so
that
she
could
hear
she
was
a
wonder
at
framing
up
reasons
for
hurling
the
lease
back
at
the
landlord
one
year
she
quit
because
the
owner
papered
the
upstairs
with
a
jay
pattern
that
cost
only
cents
a
bolt
another
time
the
family
next
door
kept
chickens
usually
the
children
across
the
alley
were
not
fit
associates
for
their
own
little
brood
one
time
she
quit
on
account
of
a
cockroach
she
saw
it
scoot
across
the
pantry
and
that
afternoon
she
headed
for
a
renting
agency
father
suggested
that
instead
of
vacating
in
favor
of
the
cockroach
they
offer
a
reward
of
for
its
capture
dead
or
alive
and
thereby
save
a
little
money
but
she
refused
to
listen
if
the
plumbing
was
out
of
whack
the
furnace
required
too
much
coal
or
else
the
woman
across
the
street
had
been
divorced
too
many
times
if
they
squatted
in
a
neighborhood
jump
was
ashamed
to
give
her
address
to
friends
in
the
congregation
if
they
got
into
a
nest
of
the
new
rich
then
laura
had
the
worked
on
her
because
jump
was
on
a
salary
and
she
had
to
ride
on
the
trolleys
so
she
began
looking
for
a
street
in
which
intellect
would
successfully
stack
up
against
the
good
old
collateral
and
of
course
that
meant
a
long
search
therefore
every
may
something
red
and
about
the
size
of
a
caboose
backed
up
to
the
jumps
several
husky
boys
began
throwing
things
out
of
the
windows
father
did
a
vanishing
act
when
it
came
to
lifting
one
corner
of
a
piano
or
hanging
pictures
he
was
a
sad
bluff
and
he
knew
it
how
about
paradise
he
asked
one
day
i
understand
that
inside
of
the
pearly
gates
each
family
has
permanent
quarters
there
are
no
folding
beds
to
juggle
down
back
stairways
no
picture
cords
to
shorten
no
curtain
poles
to
saw
off
no
book
cases
to
get
jammed
in
stairways
i
am
sure
there
will
be
no
piano
movers
for
i
have
heard
their
language
do
you
think
you
can
be
happy
in
the
promised
land
it
will
depend
entirely
on
whether
or
not
the
rugs
fit
she
replied
let
us
hope
for
the
best
said
jump
moral
the
queen
of
the
may
is
usually
a
woman
batch
of
letters
or
one
day
with
a
busy
one
morning
an
energetic
little
man
who
had
about
a
ton
of
work
piled
up
on
his
desk
came
down
town
with
a
hop
skip
and
jump
determined
to
clean
up
the
whole
before
nightfall
he
had
taken
eight
hours
of
slumber
and
a
cold
dip
in
the
porcelain
after
breakfast
he
came
out
into
the
spring
sunshine
feeling
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
and
as
snippy
as
a
young
colt
me
to
the
office
to
get
that
stack
of
letters
off
my
mind
said
the
hopeful
citizen
when
he
dashed
into
the
office
he
carried
pounds
of
steam
and
was
keen
for
the
attack
a
tall
man
with
tan
whiskers
arose
from
behind
the
desk
and
greeted
him
how
are
you
feeling
this
morning
asked
the
stranger
swell
and
sassy
was
the
reply
and
yet
you
may
join
the
appendicitis
colony
and
day
after
you
may
lie
in
the
darkened
front
room
with
floral
offerings
on
all
sides
said
the
stranger
what
you
want
is
one
of
our
pneumatic
policies
with
the
reserve
fund
clause
kindly
glance
at
this
chart
suppose
you
take
the
reactionable
endowment
with
the
special
proviso
permitting
the
accumulation
of
both
premium
and
interest
on
a
policy
for
years
you
make
clear
whether
you
live
or
die
while
the
company
loses
as
you
can
see
for
yourself
this
is
my
began
the
man
or
you
may
prefer
the
automatic
tontine
policy
with
continued
the
death
angel
in
this
case
the
entire
residue
goes
into
the
sinking
fund
and
draws
compound
interest
this
is
made
possible
under
our
new
system
of
reducing
operating
expenses
to
a
minimum
and
putting
the
executive
department
into
the
hands
of
new
york
financiers
who
do
not
seek
pecuniary
reward
but
are
actuated
by
a
philanthropic
desire
to
do
good
to
all
persons
living
west
of
the
alleghenies
that
will
be
about
all
from
you
said
the
man
mosey
duck
up
an
alley
then
you
do
care
what
becomes
of
your
family
asked
the
stranger
in
a
horrified
tone
my
relatives
are
collecting
all
of
their
money
in
advance
said
the
man
if
they
are
not
worrying
over
the
future
i
do
see
why
you
should
lose
any
sleep
so
the
solicitor
went
out
and
told
every
one
along
the
street
that
the
man
lacked
foresight
at
the
industrious
little
man
picked
up
letter
number
and
said
to
the
blonde
stenographer
dear
sir
at
that
moment
the
head
of
the
credit
department
hit
him
on
the
back
and
said
he
had
a
good
one
it
was
all
about
little
frankie
the
only
child
the
phenom
the
prodigy
illustration
new
in
every
large
establishment
there
is
a
gurgling
parent
who
comes
down
in
the
morning
with
a
story
concerning
the
incipient
depew
out
at
their
house
it
seems
that
little
frankie
has
been
told
something
at
sunday
school
and
he
asked
his
mother
about
it
and
she
told
him
whereupon
the
infant
joker
arose
to
the
emergency
and
said
and
then
you
get
it
and
any
one
who
does
laugh
is
lacking
in
a
finer
appreciation
of
child
nature
the
busy
man
listened
to
latest
and
asked
what
the
rest
of
it
so
the
parent
remarked
to
several
people
that
day
that
the
man
was
sinking
into
a
crabbed
old
age
at
the
man
repeated
dear
sir
and
a
voice
came
to
him
remarking
on
the
beauty
of
the
weather
a
person
who
might
have
been
professor
of
in
the
pike
county
agricultural
seminary
so
far
as
was
concerned
took
the
man
by
the
hand
and
informed
him
that
he
the
man
was
a
prominent
citizen
and
that
being
the
case
he
would
be
given
a
reduction
on
the
edition
while
doing
his
words
a
minute
he
worked
a
kellar
trick
and
produced
a
large
prospectus
from
under
his
coat
before
the
busy
man
could
grab
a
spindle
and
defend
himself
he
was
looking
at
a
photo
of
aristotle
and
listening
to
all
the
different
reasons
why
the
work
should
be
in
every
gentleman
library
then
the
agent
whispered
the
inside
price
to
him
so
that
the
stenographer
would
not
hear
and
began
to
fill
out
a
blank
the
man
summoned
all
his
strength
and
made
a
buck
i
do
read
books
he
said
i
am
an
intellectual
nit
clear
out
so
the
agent
gave
him
a
couple
of
pitying
looks
and
departed
meeting
in
the
doorway
a
person
with
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
a
roll
of
blue
prints
under
his
arm
the
man
looked
up
and
moaned
he
recognized
his
visitor
as
a
most
dangerous
monomaniac
the
one
who
is
building
a
house
and
wants
to
show
the
plans
i
got
everything
figured
out
he
began
except
that
we
ca
get
from
the
dining
room
to
the
library
without
going
through
the
laundry
and
there
no
flue
connecting
with
the
kitchen
what
do
you
think
better
do
i
think
you
ought
to
live
at
a
hotel
was
the
reply
the
monomaniac
went
home
and
told
his
wife
that
he
had
been
insulted
at
came
a
committee
of
ladies
soliciting
funds
for
the
home
for
the
friendless
those
who
are
friendless
do
know
their
own
luck
said
the
busy
man
whereupon
the
ladies
went
outside
and
agreed
that
he
was
a
brute
at
noon
he
went
out
and
lunched
on
bromo
seltzer
when
he
rushed
back
to
tackle
his
correspondence
he
was
met
by
a
large
body
of
walking
delegates
who
told
him
that
he
had
employed
a
man
to
paint
his
barn
and
that
he
was
a
candidate
for
the
boycott
he
put
in
an
hour
squaring
himself
and
then
he
turned
to
the
stenographer
how
far
have
we
got
he
asked
sir
was
the
reply
illustration
just
then
he
got
the
last
straw
a
bewildered
rufus
with
a
letter
of
introduction
that
took
minutes
when
rufe
walked
out
the
busy
man
fell
with
his
face
among
the
unanswered
letters
call
a
cab
he
said
the
is
out
of
order
was
the
reply
ring
for
a
messenger
he
said
she
pulled
the
buzzer
and
in
minutes
there
slowly
entered
a
boy
from
the
telegraph
office
the
man
let
out
a
low
howl
like
that
of
a
prairie
wolf
and
ran
from
the
office
when
he
arrived
at
home
he
threw
his
hat
at
the
rack
and
then
made
the
children
back
into
the
corner
and
keep
quiet
his
wife
told
around
that
henry
was
working
too
hard
moral
work
is
a
snap
but
the
intermissions
do
up
the
nervous
system
sickly
dream
and
how
it
was
doctored
one
day
a
pure
white
soul
that
made
sonnets
by
hand
was
sitting
in
his
apartment
embroidering
a
canto
he
had
all
the
curtains
drawn
and
was
sitting
beside
a
shaded
candle
waiting
for
the
muse
to
keep
her
appointment
he
wore
an
azure
occasionally
he
wept
drying
his
eyes
on
a
salmon
pink
handkerchief
bordered
with
yellow
morning
glories
any
one
could
tell
by
looking
at
him
that
he
was
a
delicate
organism
and
had
been
raised
a
pet
presently
he
put
his
left
hand
to
his
brow
and
began
to
indite
with
a
pen
on
red
paper
then
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
oh
fudge
said
the
author
that
distressing
sound
and
just
when
i
was
beginning
to
generate
ethereal
vapor
hereafter
i
shall
order
the
vulgar
tradespeople
to
deliver
all
marshmallows
at
the
entrance
he
began
to
write
again
reviving
himself
at
the
end
of
each
word
by
means
of
smelling
salts
he
did
not
see
the
artist
standing
in
the
doorway
the
artist
was
a
muscular
person
with
an
ashen
complexion
and
a
suit
that
was
not
large
enough
to
show
the
entire
pattern
he
carried
a
bludgeon
with
a
horse
head
on
it
in
order
to
attract
the
attention
of
swinburne
he
whistled
through
his
teeth
whereupon
the
author
jumped
over
the
table
and
fell
among
the
rugs
faintly
calling
mother
mother
cut
it
out
exclaimed
the
artist
what
matter
huh
oh
how
you
startled
me
said
the
author
sitting
up
among
the
rugs
just
as
you
came
in
i
was
writing
about
the
fays
and
the
elfins
i
was
in
the
deep
greenwood
the
velvet
sward
kissing
my
wan
cheek
and
the
leaves
whispering
overhead
illustration
i
see
said
the
artist
a
dark
change
from
an
interior
to
a
wood
set
that
all
right
if
you
can
do
it
quick
who
did
you
say
you
was
doing
it
for
the
fays
i
mentioned
the
fays
and
elfins
replied
the
author
i
heard
of
the
fays
said
the
artist
they
out
on
the
orpheum
circuit
now
but
the
elfins
no
what
kind
of
a
turn
do
they
do
ah
the
elfins
said
the
author
they
dance
in
the
moonlight
and
skip
from
tree
to
tree
acrobatic
stuff
with
light
effects
eh
well
you
on
a
couple
of
mackerels
i
never
see
any
benders
that
could
get
away
with
a
talking
act
you
want
to
give
your
piece
to
somebody
that
can
boost
you
you
write
a
good
gingery
skit
for
me
and
miss
fromage
and
we
put
your
name
on
a
in
letters
big
enough
to
scare
a
horse
i
gather
from
the
somewhat
technical
character
of
your
conversation
my
dear
sir
that
you
are
associated
with
the
drama
said
the
author
is
it
a
kid
asked
the
artist
wuz
you
ever
in
front
do
you
look
at
the
pictures
in
the
windows
i
rank
of
rank
and
fromage
miss
fromage
is
the
other
half
this
season
and
if
you
seen
her
a
block
off
you
say
it
or
ai
it
lillian
russell
we
just
closed
with
mcgoohan
boisterous
burlesquers
we
was
so
strong
that
we
killed
the
rest
of
the
bill
so
we
got
the
blue
envelope
now
they
using
all
our
business
including
the
gag
about
the
custard
pie
to
what
am
i
indebted
for
the
honor
of
this
visit
asked
the
author
i
heard
that
you
was
a
litry
mug
and
i
around
here
to
see
you
about
a
sketch
for
me
and
miss
fromage
the
one
i
got
now
is
all
right
but
in
it
i
got
to
eat
eggs
and
with
shows
a
day
that
askin
too
much
of
any
artist
this
sketch
was
wrote
for
us
by
the
man
that
handles
the
transfer
baggage
at
bucyrus
he
fixed
it
up
while
we
was
waitin
for
a
train
i
been
using
it
since
and
it
goes
just
as
strong
as
ever
but
i
like
to
get
new
stuff
once
in
a
while
so
i
want
you
to
fake
up
something
that
kill
right
in
their
seats
here
the
scenario
my
wife
a
society
girl
and
supposed
to
be
a
dead
swell
that
come
to
take
her
to
a
masquerade
with
that
to
work
on
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
fill
in
the
talk
i
have
recently
prepared
a
play
but
i
am
not
sure
that
it
will
meet
your
requirements
said
the
author
it
is
called
language
of
flowers
there
are
three
characters
in
the
play
a
young
shepherd
named
ethelbert
the
lady
gwendolin
and
a
waiting
maid
we
could
carry
three
people
said
the
artist
you
better
use
a
dummy
instead
of
the
hired
girl
i
do
an
awful
funny
wrassle
with
a
dummy
go
ahead
and
slip
me
the
plot
it
is
an
idyllic
thing
said
the
author
ethelbert
is
in
love
with
gwendolin
but
he
is
not
certain
that
his
love
is
reciprocated
so
he
sends
her
the
flowers
the
brings
them
into
the
bower
where
lady
gwendolin
is
seated
and
with
them
a
scroll
of
verses
from
ethelbert
the
lady
gwendolin
unrolls
the
scroll
and
reads
in
the
veins
of
the
petals
are
the
lines
i
fain
would
speak
and
breathing
low
in
the
perfumed
leaves
is
the
name
hold
on
said
the
artist
that
a
cinch
have
a
come
on
with
the
flowers
lottie
says
know
who
sent
these
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
his
nobs
gets
off
then
her
alone
with
the
big
of
hollyhawks
that
i
supposed
to
be
sendin
her
savvy
she
says
there
no
three
ways
about
it
i
got
this
gazabo
dead
to
rights
she
goes
on
to
talk
about
me
leading
up
to
her
song
will
be
our
champion
once
again
bing
the
rings
then
me
on
quick
see
i
thought
out
a
that
sure
to
get
a
holler
the
minute
i
come
on
i
wear
a
pair
of
pants
made
out
of
tin
foil
a
fur
coat
with
lace
around
the
bottom
and
on
my
head
i
wear
a
with
some
fastened
to
it
as
i
come
down
stage
i
make
some
crack
about
just
escapin
from
a
business
college
when
i
see
the
doll
i
go
over
and
slap
her
on
the
back
pull
out
a
sprinklin
can
and
water
the
flowers
you
have
to
fix
me
up
a
line
to
introduce
the
sprinkler
as
soon
as
she
sees
me
she
gets
stuck
so
she
hands
me
one
of
the
flowers
i
say
a
pazizum
then
i
take
a
out
of
my
vest
and
shake
some
salt
on
the
flower
and
eat
it
i
done
that
with
a
piece
called
boiled
dinner
and
it
always
went
big
when
she
sees
me
eat
the
flower
that
makes
her
sore
understand
she
comes
at
me
with
a
pass
i
fall
over
a
chair
and
do
a
head
spin
you
fix
up
a
strong
line
for
me
just
as
i
go
over
the
chair
then
what
the
matter
cull
here
bud
open
your
eyes
the
author
had
fallen
in
a
heap
on
the
antique
writing
desk
hully
chee
exclaimed
the
artist
he
croaked
moral
a
classic
is
never
safe
except
in
the
church
parlor
two
old
pals
and
the
call
for
once
there
was
a
married
man
who
had
two
friends
whom
he
had
not
given
up
even
to
oblige
the
missus
they
were
two
men
whom
he
had
known
since
boyhood
happy
days
away
back
in
sleepy
hollow
once
in
a
while
the
man
would
have
the
two
around
to
the
house
for
dinner
of
these
two
friends
one
was
a
gusher
and
the
other
a
grouch
the
gusher
was
eternally
bubbling
over
with
compliments
and
kind
wishes
whenever
he
met
an
acquaintance
he
handed
him
a
rhetorical
yard
of
daisies
and
then
smeared
him
with
sweet
endearments
his
talk
never
had
any
specific
purport
it
was
unadulterated
con
the
gusher
should
have
been
in
the
diplomatic
service
one
of
his
hot
specialties
was
to
get
up
at
dinner
parties
and
propose
toasts
he
would
the
ladies
until
they
flushed
crimson
from
the
joy
of
being
even
if
the
speech
was
known
to
be
blarney
it
never
failed
to
swell
the
adorable
creatures
as
he
called
them
illustration
he
had
a
shake
for
every
man
he
met
and
after
the
second
day
he
called
him
old
fellow
and
inquired
as
to
his
health
in
a
tone
of
trembling
solicitude
and
picked
little
pieces
of
lint
off
his
coat
i
know
it
guff
the
man
would
say
after
the
gusher
had
passed
on
but
my
stars
he
can
ladle
out
that
soothing
syrup
and
never
spill
a
drop
the
grouch
on
the
other
hand
gave
a
correct
imitation
of
a
bear
with
a
sore
toe
his
conversation
was
largely
made
up
of
grunts
he
carried
a
facial
expression
that
frightened
little
children
in
street
cars
and
took
all
the
starch
out
of
sentimental
young
ladies
he
seemed
perpetually
to
carry
the
of
a
horrible
nightmare
some
said
that
he
had
been
blighted
in
love
and
had
soured
on
the
universe
others
imagined
that
his
liver
was
out
of
whack
at
any
rate
he
was
shy
on
sweetness
and
light
his
dial
suggested
a
map
of
the
bad
lands
and
he
was
just
out
of
kind
words
he
could
knock
better
than
he
could
boost
when
the
gusher
would
arise
at
the
dinner
table
to
blow
bubbles
and
distribute
candy
the
grouch
would
slide
down
in
his
chair
until
he
was
resting
on
his
shoulder
blades
he
seemed
to
have
a
calomel
taste
in
his
mouth
as
he
listened
to
the
musical
drip
of
the
that
kind
of
language
went
with
some
people
but
nix
for
sweeney
the
wife
of
the
married
man
liked
the
gusher
and
tolerated
the
grouch
every
time
the
gusher
came
into
the
flat
he
held
her
hand
a
little
longer
than
necessary
and
looked
into
her
hazel
eyes
and
told
her
she
was
becoming
younger
and
more
charming
every
day
after
a
woman
turns
the
corner
those
speeches
are
worth
a
dollar
a
word
because
she
finds
herself
guessing
at
times
husband
never
was
jealous
he
knew
that
the
gusher
told
every
woman
the
same
thing
playing
no
favorites
when
the
grouch
came
to
see
them
he
said
how
are
you
and
then
began
to
kick
on
the
weather
and
tell
about
his
rheumatism
one
thing
was
certain
the
grouch
never
would
break
up
any
happy
homes
and
it
was
predicted
that
he
would
never
get
a
wife
unless
he
took
her
on
a
mortgage
every
husband
has
a
few
friends
who
come
in
for
hard
raps
from
the
wife
and
the
grouch
got
all
that
was
coming
to
him
she
used
to
declare
up
and
down
that
she
was
going
to
break
his
plate
and
revoke
his
license
husband
would
remind
her
that
he
and
the
grouch
had
roomed
together
at
college
and
done
the
comrades
act
ever
since
they
were
boys
he
would
assure
her
that
the
grouch
was
a
good
fellow
but
you
had
to
know
him
thirty
or
forty
years
before
you
found
it
out
he
would
smooth
her
down
and
straighten
out
her
feathers
and
she
would
agree
to
give
the
grouch
just
one
more
chance
illustration
it
came
about
that
one
year
the
married
man
got
gay
and
swam
out
to
where
it
was
over
his
head
in
his
keen
anxiety
to
enlarge
his
business
he
took
on
about
three
tons
of
liabilities
ninety
days
make
but
a
fleeting
span
when
notes
are
falling
due
one
day
the
married
man
found
himself
hanging
on
the
edge
of
the
gully
with
a
choice
of
jumping
to
the
rocks
below
or
waiting
to
be
scalped
it
was
not
a
dignified
thing
to
do
but
he
had
to
yell
for
assistance
and
yell
plenty
he
to
the
gusher
friend
of
his
youth
and
to
his
children
he
explained
that
his
heels
were
beating
a
tattoo
on
the
ragged
edge
of
insolvency
and
unless
he
could
raise
the
wind
it
meant
a
receiver
over
at
the
works
his
credit
evaporated
and
the
pianola
to
the
the
gusher
listened
with
tears
in
his
eyes
in
a
voice
all
choked
with
sobs
he
tendered
his
sympathy
and
his
sincere
hope
that
all
would
yet
be
well
he
told
him
it
grieved
him
to
see
a
friend
go
under
the
rollers
it
tore
his
heart
it
did
for
sure
in
fact
it
had
so
upset
him
that
he
would
have
to
go
out
into
the
air
so
he
did
an
olga
nethersole
exit
with
one
hand
over
his
streaming
eyes
and
the
friend
sat
there
with
salt
water
spattered
all
over
him
and
nothing
in
his
hand
as
soon
as
he
had
dried
his
clothes
he
went
to
the
grouch
and
candidly
owned
up
that
he
was
on
the
waiting
list
for
the
poor
house
unless
he
could
borrow
enough
to
tide
him
over
as
might
have
been
expected
the
grouch
began
to
roast
him
he
told
him
that
he
did
have
as
much
business
gumption
as
a
belgian
hare
and
a
chump
who
would
walk
into
debt
with
his
eyes
open
deserved
to
get
it
right
in
the
collar
if
you
looking
for
sympathy
you
barked
up
the
wrong
tree
said
the
grouch
i
not
was
the
reply
i
just
received
enough
sympathy
to
last
me
all
winter
the
grouch
snarled
and
reached
for
his
check
book
you
can
have
whatever
you
need
but
you
do
deserve
it
he
said
and
he
signed
it
leaving
it
blank
above
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
have
saved
my
life
i
will
try
to
forgive
you
for
lacerating
my
feelings
said
the
married
man
they
retained
the
flat
but
the
grouch
is
just
as
unpopular
as
ever
moral
a
friend
who
is
very
near
and
dear
may
in
time
become
as
useless
as
a
relative
regular
kind
of
a
place
and
the
usual
way
it
turned
once
there
was
a
beanery
where
one
could
tell
the
day
of
the
week
by
what
was
on
the
table
the
stroke
oar
of
this
food
bazaar
had
been
in
the
business
for
years
and
she
had
earned
her
harp
three
times
over
the
prune
joke
never
touched
her
and
she
had
herself
trained
so
as
not
to
hear
any
sarcastic
cracks
about
the
oleo
she
prided
herself
on
the
atmosphere
of
culture
that
permeated
the
establishment
and
on
the
fact
that
she
did
not
harbor
any
improper
characters
a
good
many
improper
characters
came
around
and
sized
up
the
and
then
blew
it
was
a
such
as
many
of
our
best
people
know
all
about
even
if
they
wo
tell
the
landlady
was
doing
what
she
could
to
discourage
the
beef
trust
but
she
carried
a
heavy
line
of
oatmeal
she
had
oatmeal
to
burn
and
sometimes
she
did
it
and
she
often
remarked
that
spinach
had
iron
in
it
and
was
great
for
the
blood
one
of
her
pet
theories
was
that
rice
contained
more
nutriment
than
could
be
found
in
spring
chicken
but
the
boarders
allowed
that
she
never
saw
a
spring
chicken
in
the
cast
of
characters
were
many
of
the
old
favorites
there
was
the
lippy
boy
with
the
williams
and
walker
shirts
who
knew
the
names
of
all
the
and
could
tell
when
there
was
a
good
variety
show
in
town
then
there
was
the
other
kind
with
a
mustache
and
a
prominent
adam
apple
who
was
very
careful
about
his
pronunciation
he
belonged
to
a
social
purity
club
that
had
a
yell
his
idea
of
a
hurrah
was
to
get
in
a
parlor
with
a
few
sisters
who
were
under
the
age
limit
and
sing
the
bass
part
of
pull
for
the
shore
illustration
lippy
then
there
was
the
old
boarder
he
was
the
having
lived
in
and
hotels
all
his
life
he
had
developed
a
gloom
that
surrounded
him
like
a
morning
fog
he
had
a
way
of
turning
things
over
with
his
fork
as
if
to
say
well
i
do
know
about
this
and
he
never
believed
anything
he
saw
in
the
papers
he
said
the
papers
printed
those
things
just
to
fill
up
the
circassian
princess
that
brought
in
the
vittles
paid
more
attention
to
him
than
to
any
one
else
because
if
he
did
get
egg
on
his
lettuce
he
was
liable
to
cry
all
over
the
table
cloth
then
there
was
the
chubby
man
who
came
in
every
evening
and
told
what
had
happened
at
the
store
that
day
and
there
was
a
human
who
made
puns
one
of
the
necessary
features
of
a
refined
joint
is
the
slender
thing
who
is
taking
music
and
has
mommer
along
to
fight
off
the
managers
and
hush
the
voice
of
scandal
this
had
one
of
these
combinations
that
was
a
dream
daughter
was
full
of
kubelik
and
josef
hoffman
away
back
in
the
pines
somewhere
there
was
a
father
who
was
putting
up
for
the
outfit
mother
job
seemed
to
be
to
sit
around
and
root
she
was
a
consistent
little
booster
if
what
mother
said
was
true
then
effie
voice
was
a
good
deal
better
than
it
sounded
she
said
the
teachers
were
just
crazy
about
it
and
all
of
them
agreed
that
effie
ought
to
go
to
paris
or
milan
the
slangy
boy
with
the
shirt
went
them
one
better
and
said
that
of
the
phoney
melbas
in
the
country
ought
to
pull
for
the
old
country
and
wait
until
they
were
sent
for
illustration
old
in
this
same
there
was
a
widow
whose
husband
had
neglected
to
die
being
left
all
alone
in
the
world
she
had
gone
out
to
make
her
way
since
which
time
she
had
gained
about
pounds
and
was
considered
great
company
by
the
young
men
necessarily
there
was
a
pale
lady
who
loved
to
read
and
who
stuck
to
the
patterns
that
appeared
in
godey
magazine
soon
after
the
war
then
there
was
the
married
couple
without
any
children
or
furniture
of
their
own
and
the
only
reason
they
did
take
a
house
was
that
henry
had
to
be
out
of
town
so
often
henry
salary
had
been
whooped
a
year
and
she
was
just
beginning
to
say
gown
instead
of
dress
she
had
the
society
column
for
breakfast
and
things
looked
dark
for
henry
for
many
months
this
conventional
group
of
ordinary
mortals
had
lived
in
a
rut
at
each
they
rounded
up
and
mechanically
devoured
what
was
doled
out
to
them
and
folded
their
napkins
and
broke
ranks
each
day
was
the
duplicate
of
another
and
life
had
petered
down
to
a
routine
one
evening
just
as
they
had
come
in
for
their
vermicelli
a
new
boarder
glided
into
their
midst
she
was
a
tall
gypsy
queen
with
about
worth
of
clothes
that
fit
her
everywhere
and
all
the
time
and
she
had
this
kind
of
a
walk
the
same
being
a
cue
for
all
the
other
girls
to
get
out
their
hardware
when
she
moved
up
to
the
table
and
began
to
distribute
a
few
sample
smiles
so
as
to
indicate
the
character
of
her
work
the
musical
team
went
out
with
the
tide
the
grass
widow
curled
up
like
an
autumn
leaf
the
married
lady
dropped
into
the
scrub
division
the
lady
who
read
was
shy
a
spoon
and
afraid
to
ask
for
it
the
men
were
all
and
the
help
was
running
into
chairs
and
dropping
important
parts
of
the
menu
presently
the
landlady
came
in
and
explained
she
said
that
williams
was
in
the
city
to
shop
for
a
couple
of
days
and
her
husband
would
be
up
on
the
night
train
whereupon
five
men
fell
under
the
table
moral
nothing
ever
happens
at
a
boarding
house
man
who
had
a
true
friend
to
steer
him
once
there
was
a
soul
who
was
handicapped
by
a
true
and
lasting
friendship
sometimes
he
suspected
that
if
he
could
be
left
to
himself
he
would
struggle
along
from
one
saturday
night
to
another
and
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
cars
and
possibly
extract
some
joy
from
this
life
in
his
own
simple
rube
fashion
but
every
time
he
turned
around
friend
was
right
there
to
tell
him
what
to
do
friend
was
somewhat
of
a
in
the
regulation
of
his
own
private
affairs
but
he
knew
just
how
to
manage
for
some
one
else
so
he
used
to
tell
the
victim
where
to
have
his
clothes
made
and
he
would
pick
out
his
shirt
patterns
for
him
and
tell
him
how
often
he
needed
a
drink
and
in
other
ways
relieve
him
of
all
responsibilities
illustration
true
if
the
poor
mark
wanted
to
remain
in
his
room
and
read
something
by
william
dean
howells
the
friend
would
compel
him
to
put
on
his
and
go
out
to
a
and
meet
a
bunch
of
kioodles
who
wore
no
hats
and
talked
nothing
but
piffle
the
friend
was
always
making
business
engagements
for
him
and
then
letting
him
know
about
it
later
on
and
sometimes
friend
would
try
to
choke
him
and
take
his
money
away
from
him
and
invest
it
in
some
shine
enterprise
that
was
going
to
pay
per
cent
dividend
every
thirty
days
friend
always
meant
well
at
that
when
he
selected
the
girl
that
the
victim
was
to
marry
he
was
prompted
by
the
most
unselfish
motives
notwithstanding
which
the
victim
did
the
tall
duck
a
policeman
found
him
hiding
under
a
bridge
and
asked
are
you
a
fugitive
from
justice
no
was
the
reply
this
is
merely
a
case
of

never
seem
to
be
properly
thankful
for
all
that
we
do
in
their
behalf

who
went
back
to
the
store
on
monday
once
there
was
a
feverish
who
started
for
the
track
with
a
roll
about
the
size
of
a
lady
pencil
he
wanted
to
parlee
a
silver
certificate
and
bring
home
enough
to
pay
the
national
debt
when
he
stayed
at
home
and
marked
the
card
and
made
mind
bets
he
could
beat
five
out
of
six
he
estimated
that
he
was
losing
a
thousand
a
month
by
fooling
around
the
store
when
he
might
be
out
at
the
showing
the
ikeys
how
to
take
a
joke
and
now
saturday
afternoon
had
come
and
percy
piker
was
hanging
on
the
rear
end
of
the
with
sewed
up
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
vest
while
in
his
hand
there
fluttered
a
batch
of
clippings
written
by
the
smoke
brothers
showing
which
ones
were
sure
to
win
unless
something
happened
piker
the
amateur
gam
closed
his
eyes
and
saw
himself
buying
a
real
panama
and
a
dozen
or
so
george

he
had
a
vision
of
riding
in
a
machine

percy
had
two
or
three
good
things
that
were
guaranteed
to
go
through
they
had
been
slipped
to
him
by
a
cigar
salesman
who
knew
an
owner
they
looked
to
be
the
real
candy
when
he
arrived
at
the
track
he
gave
up
for
a
badge
and
a
and
a
couple
of
perfectos
and
this
left
him
with
and
a
little
something
on
the
side
for

hots
he
fought
his
way
to
the
and
demanded
worth
of
bright
eyes
at
to
while
he
was
struggling
to
get
to
the
fence
he
heard
some
one
say
that
appendicitis
was
right
and
would
win
by
a
city
block
a
low
moan
escaped
him
he
climbed
over
a
large
mass
of
colored
people
so
as
to
get
down
on
appendicitis
the
odds
were
to
he
got
balled
up
in
his
arithmetic
and
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
figures
to
shift
so
that
he
could
butt
in
with
his
a
bell
rang
and
the
mob
tore
for
the
fresh
air
he
climbed
a
pole
and
saw
bright
eyes
doing
a
solo
he
let
go
and
fell
in
a
faint

beaten

piker
was
first
in
the
line
shaking
like
a
pudding
he
wanted
to
cash
before
the
book
failed
a
few
moments
later
he
went
out
behind
the
grand
stand
and
counted
up
and
found
that
he
had
he
had
the
panama
and
one
shirt
the
still
small

but
he
thought
of
claire
and
his
coming
vacation
there
grew
within
him
a
high
resolve
to
clean
up
the
betting
ring
and
quit
the
mercantile
life
in
the
second
race
there
was
a
brown
mare
by
eyes
at
with
fogarty
up
whatever
that
meant
he
heard
a
hickey
in
a
striped
sweater
tell
a
man
that
josie
jinks
would
roll
in
accordingly
he
gnawed
his
way
up
to
the
workman
with
the
pencil
and
laid
twenty
at
to
then
he
wished
that
he
had
for
he
met
a
friend
who
whispered
sassafras
to
him
also
he
heard
some
one
say
that
josie
jinks
was
and
a
bad
actress
after
which
he
went
and
put
cold
water
on
his
head
and
died
several
deaths

josie
jinks
carried
on
her
back
something
just
out
of
the
cradle
that
had

marked
on
it
piker
had
his
chin
over
the
fence
and
was
wondering
if
any
one
would
gather
up
his
body
and
put
it
on
the
train
his
pulse
was
up
to
and
he
could
hear
the
band
play
he
saw
them
come
past
the
first
time
sassafras
had
a
piece
of
daylight
between
himself
and
the
bunch
the
boy
was
going
along
under
double
wraps
with
a
lot
up
his
sleeve
away
back
in
the
pocket
there
was
something
with
a
on
it
percy
clung
to
the
fence
and
he
felt
the
chill
come
up
his
legs
sassafras
had
them
smothered
he
heard
the
roar
behind
him
and
knew
that
an
awful
thing
was
being
pulled
off
but
he
did
not
have
the
heart
to
look
as
they
pounded
up
the
stretch
he
lifted
a
dying
gaze
and
saw
a
figure
move
out
of
the
horrible
and
it
was
all
over
but
the
cashing
illustration
come
on
a
maniac
with
his
collar
to
the
bad
was
found
wandering
hither
and
thither
with
in
his
left
hand
the
tout

to
shake
him
a
couple
of
times
before
he
came
to
the
tout
had
some
goods
of
a
very
superior
quality
in
the
next
race
there
was
a
collie
that
had
enough
hop
in
him
to
convert
a
selling
plater
into
a
reina
it
was
like
making
change
with
a
blind
man
rinkaboo
was
the
name
breathe
it
softly
as
very
few
were
next
the
tout
said
to
play
it
across
the
board
forward
and
back
up
and
down
he
said
that
rinkaboo
would
breeze
in
that
he
would
win
on
the
bit
doing
buck
and
wing
steps
that
all
the
others
would
seem
to
be
hitched
so
piker
allowed
the
tout
to
take
him
by
the
hand
for
he
was
too
weak
to
resist
and
together
they
wandered
off
into
dreamland
piece
by
piece
the
happy
sesterces
went
up
rinkaboo
was
played
in
all
the
books
straight
place
and
to
peep
piker
found
himself
up
in
the
grand
stand
holding
his
head
with
one
hand
while
in
the
other
hand
was
a
pinochle
deck
suitable
for
framing
if
rinkaboo
finished
at
all
piker
was
a
wealthy
person
if
he
happened
in
toward
the
head
of
the
procession
piker
would
have
to
send
for
a
furniture
van
if
he
came
first
it
would
be
a
case
of
hoboken
for
every
book
inside
of
the
fence
after
it
was
all
over
and
percy
piker
was
riding
homeward
with
his
head
out
of
a
trolley
window
he
recalled
dimly
that
a
large
number
of
ponies
came
out
on
the
track
one
of
them
was
the
color
of
an
old
glove
and
was
doing
a
there
was
about
twenty
minutes
of
fussing
around
at
the
bend
in
the
track
and
then
they
all
kited
away
like
a
flight
of
swallows
and
there
was
one
horse
in
front
and
piker
had
a
convulsion
and
frothed
at
the
mouth
presently
the
tonic
seemed
to
die
away
and
something
blew
and
rinkaboo
fell
down
and
stepped
on
his
lip
he
came
in
about
the
time
they
were
blowing
the
horn
for
the
next
race
and
now
piker
can
take
callers
up
to
his
room
and
tell
them
how
he
stood
to
win
moral
even
the
best
can
not
pick
them
every
whirl
out
of
the
box
high
art
that
was
a
little
too
high
for
the
vulgarian
who
paid
the
once
there
was
a
husband
who
was
stuck
on
plain
living
and
home
comforts
he
would
walk
around
an
angel
cake
any
old
time
to
get
action
on
some
farm
sausage
he
was
not
very
strong
for
romaine
salad
or
any
speckled
cheese
left
over
from
year
before
last
but
he
did
a
very
neat
vanishing
act
with
a
sirloin
steak
and
he
had
the
coffee
come
right
along
in
a
large
cup
he
refused
to
dally
with
the
for
this
true
american
the
course
dinner
was
a
weak
invention
of
the
benighted
foreigner
when
he
squared
up
to
his
food
he
cut
out
all
the
trimmings
this
is
the
kind
of
husband
who
peels
his
coat
in
the
evening
and
gets
himself
all
spread
out
in
a
rocking
chair
with
a
fat
cushion
under
him
he
loves
to
wear
old
velvet
slippers
with
pink
roses
worked
on
the
toes
and
the
heels
run
over
give
him
about
two
cigars
that
pull
freely
and
a
daily
paper
and
he
is
fixed
for
the
session
along
about
if
he
can
connect
with
a
triangle
of
desiccated
apple
pie
and
a
goblet
of
milk
he
is
ready
to
sink
back
on
the
husks
feeling
simply
immense
now
this
husband
had
a
fireside
that
suited
him
nearly
to
death
until
the
better
half
began
to
read
these
magazines
that
tell
how
to
beautify
the
home
her
first
play
was
to
take
out
all
the
carpets
and
have
the
floors
massaged
until
they
were
as
slick
as
glass
so
that
when
the
stepped
on
one
of
the
okra
or
bokhara
rugs
he
usually
gave
an
imitation
of
a
player
trying
to
reach
second
he
told
her
that
he
did
not
care
to
live
in
a
rink
but
what
he
said
cut
very
few
lemons
with
the
she
was
looking
at
the
pictures
of
homes
and
beginning
to
realize
that
the
steel
engravings
and
the
enlarged
photographs
of
yap
relatives
would
have
to
go
illustration
living
one
day
when
the
provider
struck
the
premises
he
found
the
workmen
putting
red
burlap
on
the
walls
of
the
why
the
he
asked
ca
we
afford
love
of
art
is
the
true
essence
of
the
higher
life
said
the
√¶sthete
and
she
began
to
read
a
booklet
bound
in
the
same
paper
that
the
butcher
uses
when
he
wraps
up
a
soup
bone
come
again
said
the
wage
earner
who
was
slow
at
catching
these
ruskin
twisters
this
is
art
burlap
and
not
the
kind
that
they
use
for
sacking
peanuts
explained
the
disciple
of
beauty
above
the
burlap
will
be
a
shelf
of
weathered
oak
and
then
above
that
a
frieze
of
blue
jimson
flowers
then
when
we
draw
all
of
the
curtains
and
light
one
candle
in
here
it
will
make
a
swell
effect
i
feel
that
we
are
going
to
be
very
happy
he
said
and
then
he
went
out
and
sat
behind
the
barn
where
he
could
smoke
his
pipe
and
meditate
on
the
uncertainties
of
life
illustration
next
day
he
discovered
that
she
had
condemned
his
and
the
centre
table
on
which
he
used
to
stack
his
reading
matter
and
keep
a
plate
of
apples
handy
when
he
entered
the
improved
and
modernized
living
room
he
found
himself
up
against
a
job
lot
of
beauty
and
no
mistake
all
the
furniture
was
straight
up
and
down
it
seemed
to
have
been
chopped
out
with
an
axe
and
was
meant
to
hold
up
members
of
the
rhinoceros
family
on
the
high
shelf
was
a
row
of
shaving
mugs
crippled
beer
steins
undersized
coal
scuttles
and
various
copper
kettles
that
had
seen
better
days
at
last
we
have
a
room
that
satisfies
every
craving
of
my
soul
said
the
wife
i
am
more
than
satisfied
observed
the
treasurer
i
am
delirious
with
joy
my
only
regret
is
that
an
providence
did
not
mould
me
into
a
different
shape
so
that
i
might
sit
down
in
some
of
these
chairs
what
are
those
iron
dinkuses
sticking
out
from
the
wall
illustration
those
are
florentine
lanterns
she
replied
and
they
are
very
roycroftie
even
if
they
do
give
any
light
next
she
started
in
on
the
rule
no
for
making
home
more
cheerful
is
to
put
in
a
shelf
wherever
there
is
room
for
one
after
which
the
shelf
is
loaded
down
with
etruscan
growlers
and
antique
jugs
the
husband
could
not
tell
the
difference
between
high
art
and
junk
the
female
bradleyite
covered
the
walls
with
about
plates
each
with
a
blue
on
it
they
looked
very
cheap
to
him
until
he
received
the
bill
and
then
he
learned
that
they
were
old
delft
and
came
to
apiece
in
fact
after
his
wife
had
been
haunting
the
places
for
a
while
he
learned
that
any
article
which
happened
to
be
old
and
shopworn
and
cracked
was
the
one
that
commanded
the
top
price
she
never
let
up
until
she
had
made
the
whole
house
thoroughly
artistic
her
women
acquaintances
would
come
in
and
she
would
show
them
the
dark
oak
effects
and
the
frescoes
and
the
monastery
settee
with
the
bottom
in
it
and
the
corroded
that
she
had
bought
for
and
the
table
spread
made
from
overall
material
with
just
one
yellow
poppy
in
the
middle
and
they
would
have
different
kinds
of
duck
fits
and
say
that
it
was
grand
and
that
her
taste
was
simply
faultless
after
that
she
would
care
what
husband
said
he
was
a
fairly
patient
man
and
all
he
complained
of
was
that
when
he
sat
down
he
dislocated
his
spine
while
the
brass
knobs
wore
spots
on
him
and
the
table
should
have
had
a
couple
of
holes
for
him
to
put
his
legs
through
and
he
find
a
place
in
which
to
stretch
out
and
he
needed
a
derrick
to
move
one
of
the
chairs
and
at
night
when
the
moonlight
came
into
his
room
and
he
saw
all
the
bummy
lined
up
on
the
and
the
instruments
of
torture
staring
at
him
from
every
corner
of
the
room
he
would
crawl
down
under
the
covers
and
dream
of
his
childhood
home
with
the
sofas
and
the
deep
and
the
big
bureaus
that
were
meant
to
hold
things
and
not
to
look
at
however
he
has
been
unable
to
arrest
the
after
the
beautiful
for
only
last
week
she
purchased
a
clock
price
moral
there
is
no
place
like
home
and
some
husbands
are
glad
of
it
patient
toiler
who
got
it
in
the
usual
once
there
was
an
office
employee
with
a
education
he
believed
it
was
his
duty
to
learn
to
labor
and
to
wait
he
read
pamphlets
and
magazine
articles
on
success
and
how
to
make
it
a
cinch
he
knew
that
if
he
made
no
changes
and
never
beefed
for
more
salary
but
just
buckled
down
and
put
in
extra
time
and
pulled
for
the
house
he
would
arrive
in
time
the
faithful
worker
wanted
to
be
department
manager
the
hours
were
short
and
the
salary
large
and
the
work
easy
he
plugged
on
for
many
moons
keeping
his
eye
on
that
desk
for
the
manager
was
getting
into
the
division
and
he
knew
there
would
be
a
vacancy
at
last
the
house
gave
the
old
manager
the
privilege
of
retiring
and
living
on
whatever
he
had
saved
ah
this
is
where
humble
merit
gets
its
reward
said
the
patient
toiler
i
can
see
myself
counting
money
that
very
day
the
main
gazooks
led
into
the
office
one
of
the
handsomest
tennis
players
that
ever
worked
on
long
island
and
introduced
him
all
around
as
the
new
department
manager
i
shall
expect
you
to
tell
archibald
all
about
the
business
said
the
main
gazooks
to
the
patient
toiler
you
see
he
has
just
graduated
from
yale
and
he
does
know
a
dum
thing
about
managing
anything
except
a
but
his
father
is
one
of
our
principal
and
he
is
engaged
to
a
young
woman
whose
uncle
is
at
the
head
of
the
trust
i
had
been
hoping
to
get
this
job
for
myself
said
the
faithful
worker
faintly
illustration
you
are
so
valuable
as
a
subordinate
and
have
shown
such
an
aptitude
for
detail
work
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
waste
you
on
a
job
said
the
main
gazooks
besides
you
are
not
equipped
you
have
not
been
to
yale
your
father
is
not
a
you
are
not
engaged
to
a
trust
get
back
to
your
high
stool
and
whatever
archibald
wants
to
know
you
tell
him
moral
one
who
wishes
to
be
a
should
not
overtrain
summer
vacation
that
was
too
good
to
once
there
was
a
wife
who
gave
the
a
vacation
by
going
into
the
country
for
a
month
dearie
took
her
to
the
train
and
all
the
way
she
kept
saying
that
it
did
not
seem
just
right
to
romp
away
on
a
pleasure
trip
and
leave
him
he
began
to
fear
that
she
would
weaken
so
he
told
her
that
while
he
was
slaving
and
humping
in
the
city
it
would
give
him
sufficient
joy
to
know
that
darling
was
out
in
the
woods
listening
to
the
birds
he
insisted
that
she
should
stay
until
she
was
thoroughly
rested
of
course
he
did
not
dare
to
make
it
too
strong
he
played
the
gag
and
threw
in
a
dash
of
marital
solicitude
and
made
an
awful
try
at
imitating
one
who
has
been
soaked
by
a
great
sorrow
as
the
missus
looked
at
him
through
her
tears
and
held
his
in
hers
little
did
she
suspect
that
he
had
framed
up
a
poker
festival
for
that
night
and
already
the
wet
goods
were
spread
out
on
the
ice
he
had
told
her
that
he
was
going
to
sit
up
in
the
library
every
evening
and
read
macaulay
history
of
england
by
opening
the
windows
on
both
sides
he
could
get
a
nice
breeze
from
the
west
along
about
if
he
got
sleepy
he
could
turn
in
why
not
it
was
a
lovely
that
he
had
mapped
out
he
submitted
it
to
pet
before
she
went
away
and
she
put
her
on
it
even
though
her
heart
ached
for
him
breakfast
at
the
strange
a
day
of
toil
interrupted
by
a
small
bunch
of
food
at
the
dairy
lunch
then
back
to
the
unfamiliar
faces
at
the
then
sitting
alone
in
the
gloaming
thinking
of
the
absent
one
then
an
hour
or
two
in
the
library
with
the
jovial
macaulay
then
to
bed
in
the
lonesome
house
and
dreams
of
sweetie
illustration
up
the
pirate
he
gave
her
a
schedule
which
she
could
consult
at
any
time
day
or
night
and
thereby
find
out
what
he
was
doing
at
that
moment
it
was
just
as
convenient
as
sending
a
marconi
every
hour
or
so
he
held
himself
down
until
the
train
had
flirted
around
the
curve
for
he
knew
that
she
was
watching
him
from
the
observation
car
then
he
threw
his
hat
in
the
air
and
began
to
do
o
i
suppose
this
is
miserable
he
said
i
can
see
a
very
poor
month
ahead
of
me
yes
not
me
wearing
all
my
bells
and
taking
a
hurdle
every
furlong
he
rushed
in
to
the
telegraph
office
and
sent
a
wire
to
her
so
that
it
would
catch
her
at
the
first
station
up
the
road
it
said
not
to
worry
and
to
take
a
good
rest
and
everything
was
moving
along
about
the
same
as
usual
with
love
and
kisses
after
which
he
went
over
to
the
brewery
to
see
if
they
would
make
a
reduction
on
wholesale
orders
hubby
went
up
street
with
his
straw
dipped
down
in
front
the
same
as
the
college
rakes
wear
them
and
his
coat
was
thrown
wide
open
to
show
the
dizzy
pleats
his
cuban
blood
was
all
het
up
and
he
told
himself
that
he
was
years
old
and
never
had
a
home
oh
but
he
was
nifty
he
was
out
of
the
corral
and
into
the
red
clover
and
nix
any
halter
and
box
stall
for
him
at
least
not
for
a
month
it
happened
that
he
had
the
usual
number
of
disreputable
friends
they
were
all
right
but
he
did
not
dare
to
have
them
up
to
the
house
because
had
investigated
them
and
returned
true
bills
they
were
a
little
too
gamey
for
presbyterian
circles
but
they
fitted
right
in
at
any
function
where
every
man
takes
off
his
coat
husband
began
to
use
the
telephone
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
he
had
organized
a
pirate
crew
that
would
go
as
far
as
you
like
at
any
game
from
to
manslaughter
for
when
a
decent
married
man
does
start
out
to
find
something
different
from
the
calm
joys
of
connubing
in
a
side
street
he
is
the
village
limit
husband
had
the
whole
shop
to
himself
he
employed
a
senegambian
who
was
a
good
worker
with
the
corkscrew
then
he
had
worth
of
dutch
lunch
sent
in
from
the
rathskeller
and
arranged
the
stacks
of
reds
whites
and
blues
he
told
himself
that
the
only
true
enjoyment
was
found
in
bachelor
hall
his
hickey
acquaintances
came
in
showing
more
or
less
stage
fright
as
they
were
not
accustomed
to
seeing
rugs
and
tidies
they
told
him
that
he
had
a
swell
joint
after
they
had
been
to
the
tea
a
couple
of
times
they
began
to
peel
and
one
of
them
started
some
rowdy
work
on
the
piano
another
backed
into
a
statuette
and
put
it
out
of
business
and
then
offered
to
pay
for
it
but
the
host
said
it
cost
only
cents
at
a
bargain
sale
illustration
of
at
the
wife
who
was
in
upper
seven
referred
to
her
and
saw
papa
sitting
by
the
student
lamp
reading
macaulay
she
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
papa
had
just
been
strung
for
a
month
rent
in
a
progressive
jack
pot
in
the
morning
when
papa
arose
and
looked
at
the
cold
welsh
rabbits
and
saw
the
cigar
ashes
all
over
the
place
and
when
he
had
a
taste
as
if
he
were
taking
care
of
a
the
glad
bohemian
existence
did
not
look
as
good
to
him
as
it
had
when
lighted
up
the
night
before
especially
as
he
had
got
the
zoop
for
some
buckerines
still
there
is
no
one
case
of
remorse
that
is
going
to
head
off
a
man
who
wants
to
be
rejuvenated
he
pulled
himself
together
on
the
second
day
and
resumed
the
merry
clip
and
there
was
nothing
doing
in
the
macaulay
line
home
did
not
get
him
until
the
lights
had
winked
out
in
the
other
places
he
would
not
leave
the
stag
club
or
the
german
garden
until
they
began
putting
the
chairs
on
the
tables
for
the
first
two
weeks
it
was
immense
in
time
however
it
struck
him
that
there
was
a
certain
monotony
in
spending
one
money
on
the
night
owls
and
showing
up
with
the
milkman
the
poker
players
were
into
him
and
he
began
to
suspect
that
he
needed
a
guardian
like
every
other
man
who
sends
his
wife
to
a
summer
place
he
ended
his
hurrah
by
making
a
few
resolutions
and
begging
her
to
come
home
and
she
will
always
believe
that
he
did
the
macaulay
act
every
evening
while
she
was
away
which
is
just
as
well
moral
in
order
to
put
a
true
value
on
civilization
one
should
pace
a
few
heats
with
the
indians
now
and
then
an
humble
beginner
moved
from
one
pinnacle
to
another
and
played
the
entire
a
team
of
proud
parents
had
a
son
named
james
henry
guff
on
the
day
of
his
birth
the
wind
changed
and
blew
in
another
direction
apples
fell
off
the
trees
chickens
went
to
roost
at
all
nature
seemed
to
have
been
given
a
jolt
by
the
portentous
event
for
james
henry
guff
was
born
to
know
all
the
brands
of
human
greatness
destiny
had
put
a
green
tag
on
him
and
nothing
could
stop
him
when
he
was
only
years
of
age
he
was
elected
captain
of
a
volunteer
fire
department
which
was
a
valuable
organization
only
when
there
was
a
fire
no
one
could
find
the
key
to
the
house
in
which
they
kept
the
but
the
papers
began
to
speak
of
him
as
captain
guff
his
intimates
called
him
cap
after
the
hose
company
disbanded
his
title
clung
to
him
and
it
was
generally
believed
that
he
had
been
with
grant
at
appomattox
not
satisfied
with
a
resounding
title
for
which
those
in
the
regular
army
have
to
struggle
for
years
captain
guff
began
to
give
lessons
on
the
flute
at
cents
an
hour
and
the
first
thing
he
knew
he
was
a
real
professor
just
the
same
as
if
he
had
gone
up
in
a
balloon
or
had
some
trained
horses
now
over
at
harvard
where
they
grow
the
english
accent
a
student
must
grind
through
a
long
course
and
a
fellowship
and
an
instructorship
before
he
blossoms
into
a
professor
which
only
goes
to
show
that
the
real
boy
can
gain
by
one
stroke
of
genius
the
renown
for
which
the
ordinary
skates
must
go
forth
and
rustle
james
henry
guff
at
the
age
of
was
both
a
captain
and
a
professor
but
his
insatiable
ambition
spurred
him
to
go
out
and
gather
other
laurels
so
he
ran
for
justice
of
the
peace
and
was
elected
the
third
time
he
ran
because
the
other
candidate
pulled
out
as
magistrate
he
became
custodian
of
a
a
and
a
stack
of
blank
affidavits
once
every
three
months
or
so
somebody
would
levy
on
a
cow
or
threaten
to
assault
and
then
the
judge
would
get
a
chance
to
operate
his
graft
but
he
did
care
so
much
about
the
income
so
long
as
he
could
be
addressed
as
judge
he
allowed
his
hair
to
grow
into
a
long
graceful
that
kept
falling
into
his
eyes
and
he
looked
at
the
sidewalk
meditatively
as
he
went
over
to
the
grocery
to
get
his
sometimes
when
he
was
far
enough
from
home
those
who
met
him
and
heard
him
called
judge
thought
that
he
was
on
the
supreme
bench
in
the
course
of
time
he
began
to
crave
a
political
job
so
he
began
to
stump
around
in
the
interests
of
the
machine
he
drove
out
to
district
with
the
american
eagle
seated
on
the
of
his
buggy
and
when
he
got
on
the
platform
he
waved
old
glory
until
both
arms
gave
out
all
of
which
went
to
prove
that
the
machine
should
be
kept
in
power
after
he
had
been
spellbinding
for
a
couple
of
seasons
a
job
printer
conferred
upon
him
the
title
of
honorable
every
time
there
was
a
speaking
then
the
hon
james
henry
guff
showed
up
with
his
voice
in
a
and
also
a
fine
assortment
of
platitudes
when
the
congressman
wrote
to
him
and
asked
him
to
get
the
swazey
county
delegates
into
line
he
always
addressed
his
letter
to
the
hon
james
henry
guff
and
in
the
course
of
time
guff
began
to
believe
illustration
james
henry
but
a
prouder
distinction
awaited
him
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
had
plugged
for
the
regular
organization
and
delivered
the
goods
at
the
state
convention
he
was
made
a
colonel
on
the
governor
staff
it
is
the
duty
of
a
colonel
on
the
governor
staff
to
ride
in
a
pullman
car
and
take
a
ball
every
time
he
is
touched
on
the
back
colonel
guff
was
a
dream
when
he
got
into
his
uniform
with
the
gold
braid
rigged
all
over
the
front
he
wore
a
chapeau
similar
to
the
one
worn
by
napoleon
at
austerlitz
but
he
had
on
top
of
it
seven
of
the
bird
which
rather
laid
over
anything
that
napoleon
ever
wore
and
when
colonel
james
henry
guff
in
his
magnificent
regalia
and
smoking
a
cigar
leaned
back
in
an
open
carriage
drawn
by
white
horses
and
allowed
the
people
to
gaze
at
him
the
grandeur
of
the
spectacle
made
one
forget
the
real
horrors
of
war
many
of
the
ardent
admirers
of
guff
and
capt
guff
and
judge
guff
and
guff
believed
that
he
had
climbed
to
the
summit
of
greatness
when
he
appeared
in
his
plume
not
so
one
year
the
state
militia
was
to
have
an
encampment
and
the
governor
gave
james
henry
guff
the
job
of
buying
all
the
beans
fresh
beef
and
other
supplies
because
there
promised
to
be
a
slight
officially
he
was
known
as
the
thus
it
came
about
that
after
years
of
endeavor
james
henry
guff
who
left
the
post
a
poor
and
unknown
boy
went
under
the
wire
a
real
general
when
his
daughters
went
away
to
boarding
school
and
were
introduced
as
the
offspring
of
james
guff
they
assumed
a
social
leadership
guff
led
the
grand
march
at
a
great
many
military
balls
at
a
banquet
costing
per
plate
he
sat
at
the
right
of
the
chairman
wearing
medals
which
had
been
presented
to
him
by
the
ward
marching
club
in
his
address
he
always
defended
the
soldier
against
unwarranted
attacks
and
protested
against
hauling
down
the
flag
at
any
time
or
place
if
the
government
adopted
a
new
machine
gun
all
the
reporters
went
over
and
interviewed
james
henry
guff
about
it
he
wrote
a
magazine
article
on
the
mistakes
of
the
british
in
south
africa
and
likewise
got
rid
of
a
few
ponderous
opinions
on
our
policy
in
the
philippines
when
he
died
the
funeral
procession
was
two
miles
long
the
family
had
to
erect
two
marble
shafts
so
as
to
find
room
for
all
of
his
titles
moral
true
democracy
scorns
a
title
unless
it
has
a
real
significance
with
the
reverse
english
maneuvers
of
joel
and
the
disappointed
orphan
an
old
residenter
who
owned
a
section
of
improved
land
and
some
town
property
besides
was
getting
too
feeble
to
go
out
and
roast
the
hired
hands
so
he
turned
the
job
over
to
his
son
this
son
was
named
joel
he
was
foolish
the
same
as
a
fox
any
one
who
got
ahead
of
joel
had
to
leave
a
call
and
start
on
a
lope
when
it
came
to
skin
games
he
was
the
original
joel
took
the
old
gentleman
aside
one
day
and
said
to
him
father
you
are
not
long
for
this
world
and
to
save
lawyer
fees
and
avoid
a
in
the
probate
court
i
think
you
ought
to
cut
up
your
estate
your
own
self
and
then
you
will
know
it
is
done
right
how
had
i
better
divide
it
asked
the
old
gentleman
you
can
put
the
whole
in
my
name
suggested
joel
that
will
save
a
lot
of
writing
then
if
any
other
relatives
need
anything
they
can
come
to
me
and
try
to
borrow
it
joel
sent
for
a
shyster
who
brought
a
bundle
of
papers
tied
with
green
braid
and
assured
the
old
gentleman
that
the
proceeding
was
a
mere
formality
when
a
legal
wolf
wants
to
work
the
on
a
soft
thing
he
always
springs
that
gag
about
a
mere
formality
joel
and
the
moved
the
old
gentleman
up
to
a
table
in
the
front
room
and
put
a
cushion
under
him
and
slipped
a
pen
into
his
hand
and
showed
him
where
to
sign
after
he
got
through
filling
the
blank
spaces
with
his
john
hancock
he
did
have
a
window
to
hoist
or
a
fence
to
lean
on
he
was
simply
sponging
on
joel
this
went
on
for
about
a
month
and
then
joel
began
to
fret
illustration
the
i
do
think
i
am
getting
a
square
deal
said
joel
here
is
an
ancient
party
without
any
assets
who
lives
with
me
week
in
and
week
out
and
does
pay
any
board
he
is
getting
too
old
and
wabbly
to
do
odd
jobs
around
the
place
and
it
looks
to
me
like
an
awful
imposition
so
he
went
to
the
old
gentleman
and
said
father
i
know
the
children
must
annoy
you
a
good
deal
they
make
so
much
noise
when
they
play
house
sometimes
we
want
to
use
the
piano
after
it
is
your
and
of
course
that
breaks
your
rest
so
i
have
been
thinking
that
you
would
be
a
lot
better
off
in
some
institution
where
they
make
a
specialty
of
looking
after
i
have
discovered
a
nice
quiet
place
you
will
live
in
a
large
brick
building
with
a
lovely
cupola
on
top
there
is
a
very
pretty
lawn
with
and
also
an
ornamental
iron
fence
so
that
the
dogs
can
not
break
in
and
bite
you
you
will
be
given
a
nice
suit
of
clothes
the
same
as
all
the
others
are
wearing
and
if
you
oversleep
yourself
in
the
morning
a
man
will
come
around
and
call
you
in
other
words
me
to
the
said
the
old
residenter
you
need
not
call
it
that
unless
you
want
to
said
joel
if
you
choose
you
may
speak
of
it
as
the
home
for
aged
persons
who
got
foolish
with
their
fountain
pens
so
joel
put
his
father
into
the
spring
wagon
and
hauled
him
over
the
hills
to
the
charity
pavilion
where
all
the
old
gentleman
had
to
do
was
to
sit
around
in
the
sun
looking
at
the
pictures
in
last
illustrated
papers
and
telling
what
a
chump
he
had
been
but
sometimes
a
man
is
not
all
in
simply
because
he
looks
to
be
wrinkled
and
doddering
joel
father
had
a
few
thinks
coming
to
him
although
he
had
been
and
put
through
the
ropes
he
still
had
a
punch
left
he
sent
for
a
lawyer
who
was
even
more
crafty
than
the
one
employed
by
joel
and
he
said
to
him
there
is
a
in
every
written
instrument
if
one
only
knows
how
to
find
it
i
want
you
to
set
aside
that
fool
deed
next
day
the
lawyer
came
for
him
in
a
carriage
and
said
they
forgot
to
put
on
a
revenue
stamp
and
so
the
transfer
is
off
and
do
i
get
all
of
my
property
back
again
asked
the
old
residenter
you
get
half
and
i
get
half
was
the
reply
of
the
lawyer
give
me
mine
said
the
old
residenter
i
from
wisconsin
and
i
want
it
in
the
hand
whatever
i
own
from
this
time
on
i
carry
right
in
my
clothes
and
any
relative
who
separates
me
from
it
will
have
to
set
his
request
to
music
then
he
went
to
a
physician
doc
he
says
they
are
counting
nine
on
me
but
i
figure
that
before
i
cash
in
i
have
time
to
spend
all
that
i
have
look
me
over
and
tell
me
how
long
i
would
last
on
a
waldorf
diet
i
want
to
gauge
my
expenses
so
as
to
leave
nothing
behind
for
joel
except
a
message
and
a
few
heirlooms
if
you
want
to
euchre
your
family
why
do
you
leave
it
to
an
orphan
asylum
suggested
the
lawyer
illustration
time
on
nix
the
orphan
asylum
said
the
old
residenter
they
would
bring
a
million
witnesses
to
prove
that
i
had
been
out
of
my
head
for
years
and
i
would
be
there
to
contradict
them
i
learn
that
by
a
singular
coincidence
all
the
old
people
who
leave
their
money
to
hospitals
and
the
like
are
mentally
irresponsible
in
order
to
prove
that
i
am
in
my
right
senses
i
will
blow
mine
so
he
went
to
palm
beach
and
other
winter
resorts
at
which
they
charge
by
the
minute
and
wherever
he
went
he
gave
a
faithful
imitation
of
the
cowboy
first
night
in
town
he
bought
himself
a
hot
raglan
with
a
surcingle
around
it
and
a
very
doggy
line
of
cravats
and
when
he
went
into
the
he
picked
out
a
table
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
door
at
which
the
girls
came
in
all
this
time
joel
was
worried
it
seemed
a
sin
and
a
shame
for
an
old
man
to
go
around
spending
his
own
money
the
residenter
had
so
much
fun
during
his
second
time
on
earth
that
he
decided
to
make
it
a
renaissance
so
he
married
a
years
old
that
he
met
in
a
hotel
lobby
and
then
joel
did
go
up
in
the
air
when
she
began
to
pick
out
snake
rings
and
diamond
the
old
gentleman
saw
that
there
was
no
longer
any
hope
for
joel
moral
when
buncoing
a
relative
always
be
sure
that
the
drops
are
regulation
strength
young
people
two
photographers
and
the
correspondence
school
of
once
there
was
a
lovely
who
went
to
a
swell
hop
and
there
met
a
corkerina
who
had
come
to
visit
a
school
friend
he
gavotted
a
few
lines
with
the
lily
they
found
it
very
easy
to
catch
step
together
and
he
did
an
expert
job
of
piloting
during
the
waltz
so
as
not
to
get
her
mussed
up
and
the
consequence
was
that
he
made
a
grand
impression
whenever
a
debutter
goes
away
to
visit
a
school
friend
she
always
meets
some
local
adonis
who
looks
to
her
to
be
about
per
cent
better
than
the
stock
of
johnnies
in
her
own
burg
and
after
a
nice
girl
has
had
a
long
and
prosperous
run
on
the
home
circuit
and
then
begins
to
curl
up
on
the
edges
and
show
signs
of
frost
she
will
find
it
a
very
wise
shift
to
try
new
territory
and
the
chances
are
that
she
will
make
a
illustration
to
prove
that
this
is
no
idle
jest
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
the
marrying
girl
usually
goes
on
the
road
a
while
before
she
closes
a
contract
the
could
not
forget
the
girl
from
another
town
she
pulled
out
next
day
but
he
looked
up
the
address
and
sent
her
the
dance
programme
that
he
had
found
in
his
overcoat
pocket
she
wrote
back
that
it
was
awfully
sweet
of
him
to
remember
poor
little
me
and
then
she
asked
one
or
two
questions
that
gave
him
a
hunch
so
he
bought
a
new
kind
of
writing
paper
said
to
be
the
latest
agony
and
he
wrote
a
nice
long
letter
in
which
he
told
her
that
she
was
very
easy
to
look
at
and
that
when
it
came
to
picking
them
up
and
setting
them
down
in
the
slow
and
dreamy
she
made
all
the
other
girls
of
his
acquaintance
look
like
a
set
of
cripples
she
returned
the
serve
with
one
of
these
chummy
epistles
written
on
all
sides
of
the
paper
with
the
crawling
up
one
margin
like
a
she
chucked
in
a
few
mushy
extracts
from
the
oatmeal
school
of
thought
and
asked
him
the
name
of
his
favorite
poet
her
pace
was
a
trifle
swift
for
harry
who
had
derived
his
education
from
the
sporting
section
of
the
daily
papers
but
he
bought
a
lover
guide
and
a
dictionary
and
decided
to
stay
in
the
size
of
it
was
that
little
harry
had
been
harpooned
all
the
way
through
he
was
the
original
sweetheart
√†
la
brochette
he
carried
with
him
night
and
day
a
vision
of
her
in
the
rig
that
she
had
flashed
on
the
night
of
the
party
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
could
wear
any
other
costume
he
would
close
his
eyes
and
try
to
hear
once
again
the
dulcet
and
mellifluous
tones
of
that
voice
which
to
him
sounded
as
good
as
an
√¶olian
harp
moved
by
gentle
zephyrs
within
a
bower
of
orchids
costing
each
so
they
exchanged
photos
next
to
the
miniature
painted
on
ivory
the
modern
photo
is
the
prize
bunk
of
the
universe
a
successful
photographer
who
has
learned
the
tricks
and
made
a
slight
study
of
human
nature
can
take
a
grass
widow
of
who
is
troubled
with
wild
hairs
and
other
excess
ornaments
and
by
tampering
with
the
negative
he
can
make
her
out
to
look
something
like
ethel
barrymore
then
she
can
send
the
picture
to
her
relations
who
live
a
long
way
off
and
they
will
never
know
the
difference
the
girl
sent
harry
a
high
art
panel
of
herself
in
which
she
was
looking
at
something
in
a
tree
and
when
he
gazed
at
it
he
had
a
palpitation
and
said
this
is
better
than
i
thought
it
was
he
told
himself
that
it
would
be
a
pleasure
and
a
privilege
to
walk
up
to
something
like
that
the
of
every
month
and
hand
it
the
envelope
he
got
a
clean
shave
and
put
on
his
other
clothes
and
went
and
had
himself
taken
by
an
artist
who
charged
a
dozen
for
the
pictures
and
to
square
his
conscience
illustration
this
specialist
could
take
any
set
of
misfit
features
and
rearrange
them
into
a
work
of
art
he
put
harry
in
front
of
the
and
scrooged
him
around
so
as
to
blanket
the
white
wings
as
much
as
possible
and
then
he
told
him
to
think
of
money
and
look
pleasant
when
the
pictures
were
delivered
harry
realized
for
the
first
time
that
he
was
a
beautiful
creature
he
sent
one
to
the
girl
and
wrote
that
it
was
a
bum
likeness
and
did
not
do
him
justice
and
so
on
in
acknowledging
receipt
she
cut
out
the
dear
mister
and
came
right
at
him
with
dear
friend
which
gave
him
such
a
stroke
of
joy
that
he
did
very
little
work
that
day
harry
did
not
have
gumption
enough
to
evolve
any
deep
system
for
landing
a
but
he
had
accidentally
hit
upon
the
cinch
method
so
long
as
courtship
consists
of
sending
idealized
cabinets
and
exchanging
nice
long
letters
there
is
but
little
chance
of
making
miscues
he
never
drops
in
of
an
afternoon
to
find
her
in
a
blue
wrapper
and
drying
her
hair
and
she
never
catches
him
smelling
of
cigarettes
when
it
comes
down
to
close
work
in
a
parlor
there
is
always
the
risk
of
having
herbert
buttinsky
on
hand
to
make
his
party
call
he
who
tells
his
love
by
mail
never
hears
anything
about
the
third
party
he
lives
in
the
sweet
delusion
that
he
has
bought
up
the
whole
house
harry
letters
to
the
girl
and
the
girl
letters
to
harry
became
more
and
more
on
that
order
until
at
last
they
began
to
burn
holes
in
the
mail
bags
after
comparing
her
picture
with
all
the
parlor
favorites
that
he
met
on
his
social
rounds
he
realized
that
she
outclassed
all
other
representatives
of
her
sex
in
her
cosy
flat
far
away
she
had
him
propped
up
on
the
piano
in
a
frame
and
featured
to
beat
the
cars
any
one
who
dropped
in
to
see
her
was
made
to
understand
that
he
was
merely
an
understudy
who
was
being
used
as
a
she
used
to
write
to
harry
and
tell
him
about
her
callers
and
what
chumps
they
were
and
then
let
him
draw
his
own
conclusions
as
to
who
was
the
real
papa
finally
harry
took
an
overdose
of
nerve
food
and
asked
her
right
out
would
she
the
answer
came
back
by
wire
and
the
same
day
he
sent
a
sealed
express
package
containing
the
ring
after
which
they
began
to
lay
plans
to
have
a
wedding
and
become
better
acquainted
to
be
continued
in
our
next
moral
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
foolish
married
couple
that
went
to
housekeeping
and
began
to
find
out
once
there
was
a
happy
pair
each
of
whom
got
stuck
on
the
photograph
of
the
other
and
thereupon
a
marriage
was
arranged
by
mail
shortly
after
taking
the
life
risk
they
started
in
to
get
acquainted
up
to
the
time
that
they
moved
into
the
arcadian
flats
and
began
to
take
orders
from
the
janitor
he
never
had
seen
little
sunshine
except
in
her
evening
frock
he
had
a
sort
of
sneaking
suspicion
that
she
arose
every
morning
already
attired
in
a
paris
gown
and
all
the
diamonds
and
she
supposed
that
he
went
to
the
office
every
day
in
his
regular
john
drew
effect
with
the
folding
hat
after
she
began
to
see
hubby
around
the
flat
in
his
other
clothes
the
horrible
truth
dawned
upon
her
that
he
was
not
such
a
hot
swell
as
he
had
looked
to
be
in
the
bunko
photograph
sometimes
on
rainy
sundays
he
would
cut
out
the
morning
service
and
decide
not
to
shave
and
then
when
she
got
a
good
long
look
at
him
she
would
begin
to
doubt
her
own
judgment
and
so
far
as
that
is
concerned
there
were
mornings
after
they
had
been
out
late
to
a
welsh
rabbit
party
when
she
was
a
little
lumpy
if
any
one
should
ask
love
young
dream
was
handed
several
goshawful
whacks
about
the
time
that
they
started
in
to
get
a
line
on
each
other
for
instance
the
first
morning
at
breakfast
it
came
out
that
her
idea
of
a
dainty
snack
with
which
to
usher
in
the
day
was
a
lettuce
sandwich
a
couple
of
olives
and
a
child
cup
full
of
cocoa
while
he
wanted
worth
of
ham
and
eggs
a
stack
of
griddle
cakes
and
a
tureen
of
coffee
she
was
a
case
of
ambrosia
and
nectar
and
he
was
plain
old
ham
and
spinach
it
used
to
give
her
hysterics
to
see
him
bark
at
an
ear
of
green
corn
at
the
same
time
making
a
sound
like
a
dredge
illustration
for
dinner
she
liked
a
little
consomm√©
en
tasse
and
then
a
nice
salad
while
he
insisted
on
a
steak
the
size
of
a
door
mat
and
german
fried
to
come
along
they
did
not
mocha
and
java
at
all
on
their
reading
matter
she
liked
henry
james
and
walter
pater
and
he
preferred
horse
papers
and
the
comic
supplement
sometimes
when
she
would
wander
off
into
the
realms
of
poesy
he
would
follow
her
as
far
as
he
could
and
then
sit
down
and
wait
for
her
to
get
through
rambling
and
come
back
if
they
took
in
a
show
she
was
always
plugging
for
fiske
or
duse
while
he
claimed
that
rogers
brothers
were
better
than
booth
and
barrett
had
been
in
their
prime
she
could
weep
over
a
tosti
serenade
and
he
would
walk
a
mile
at
any
time
to
see
a
good
buck
dance
when
they
got
around
to
fixing
up
invitation
lists
there
was
more
or
less
geeing
and
hawing
all
of
his
friends
belonged
to
the
hitemup
division
their
only
conception
of
a
happy
evening
was
to
put
the
buck
in
the
centre
of
the
table
break
a
fresh
pack
and
go
out
for
blood
wifey
found
her
most
delirious
joy
in
putting
passionate
shades
on
all
the
lamps
and
sitting
there
in
the
crimson
glow
to
discuss
maeterlinck
and
maarten
maartens
and
a
few
others
that
were
new
ones
on
the
of
the
sketch
when
they
had
an
evening
at
home
up
in
the
flat
it
was
usually
a
affair
she
would
have
the
cerebellums
in
the
front
room
looking
at
the
new
books
and
eating
peppermint
wafers
while
he
and
the
other
comanches
would
be
out
in
the
trying
to
make
their
house
rent
and
tossing
off
that
which
made
scotland
famous
sometimes
it
would
take
half
the
night
to
get
the
smoke
out
of
the
house
although
she
feared
that
she
had
turned
up
the
wrong
street
while
searching
for
her
affinity
the
partnership
arrangement
had
to
stand
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
married
life
is
a
series
of
compromises
if
he
did
well
while
sitting
in
with
some
of
his
friends
he
would
divide
up
with
her
and
she
would
take
the
money
and
buy
art
pastels
he
would
spot
the
afternoons
on
which
the
ethical
researchers
were
due
at
his
premises
and
he
would
go
to
a
dutch
restaurant
she
permitted
him
to
have
a
room
and
call
it
his
den
so
that
he
and
his
friends
could
do
the
escape
in
case
somebody
in
the
parlor
started
a
reading
he
put
up
the
coin
to
enable
her
to
attend
state
conventions
and
when
she
was
elected
recording
secretary
of
the
society
for
trying
to
find
out
what
browning
was
up
to
he
took
her
picture
around
to
all
the
newspapers
and
told
every
one
that
he
had
a
little
woman
up
at
the
house
who
was
as
keen
as
a
hawk
as
swift
as
an
eagle
and
sharper
than
chained
lightning
illustration
he
fumbled
a
great
many
of
her
but
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
admiring
her
delivery
finally
they
arranged
their
separate
schedules
so
that
they
did
not
see
much
of
each
other
and
they
began
to
get
along
all
right
occasionally
they
had
a
slight
difference
but
they
could
always
patch
it
up
for
instance
she
selected
aubrey
de
courcey
as
a
name
for
the
first
born
while
he
held
out
for
bill
so
they
had
to
compromise
on
aubrey
de
courcey
aubrey
is
now
ten
years
of
age
mother
is
teaching
him
to
crochet
and
father
is
showing
him
how
to
draw
without
tipping
off
his
hand
while
all
the
friends
are
sitting
around
waiting
to
see
aubrey
finish
moral
the
two
of
a
kind
is
not
always
the
strongest
combination
samaritan
who
got
paralysis
of
the
helping
once
there
was
a
moving
target
who
was
strong
on
the
brotherhood
of
man
he
ran
a
little
sunshine
factory
all
of
his
own
when
it
came
to
scattering
seeds
of
kindness
the
farm
drill
was
a
poor
second
every
time
he
started
down
town
he
would
have
to
zigzag
so
as
to
cover
both
sides
of
the
street
and
all
of
his
acquaintances
from
time
to
time
he
joined
fraternal
organizations
and
took
blistering
oaths
that
he
would
always
love
his
and
stand
for
any
touch
within
reason
consequently
a
good
many
people
found
it
cheaper
to
send
for
him
than
to
hire
a
professional
nurse
he
would
travel
miles
in
order
to
have
the
pleasure
of
sitting
up
with
a
corpse
and
he
was
one
of
the
handiest
in
the
business
any
one
who
happened
to
be
nursing
a
story
would
hunt
up
sympathetic
jasper
and
give
him
the
grip
and
then
weep
on
his
shoulder
usually
he
promised
to
do
what
he
could
to
square
matters
even
though
he
had
to
cut
in
where
he
was
wanted
in
flying
around
trying
to
reinstate
who
had
lost
their
jobs
and
secure
salaried
positions
for
nice
fellows
who
were
willing
to
do
anything
except
work
he
got
many
a
jolt
but
he
was
not
discouraged
one
of
his
regular
assignments
was
to
arbitrate
a
domestic
scrap
merely
out
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart
in
this
way
he
managed
to
quite
a
number
of
couples
who
were
afterward
sorry
that
they
had
been
reuned
and
what
they
said
about
him
would
get
the
blue
pencil
if
inserted
at
this
point

a
herring
starts
out
to
be

friendless
nobody
tries
to
take
the
job
away
from
him
his
acquaintances
do
what
they
can
to
boost
his
game

therefore
when
any
one
in
that
community
sought
out
a
busy
man
of
affairs
and
began
to
unwrap
his
tale
of
woe
and
offer
to
exhibit
his
wounds
the
of
would
say
here
i
give
you
a
letter
of
introduction
to
my
old
friend
jasper
he
is
a
samaritan
from
away
back
it
came
about
that
jasper
outer
office
was
frequently
coagulated
with
a
choice
assortment
of
and
all
the
brothers
who
want
to
hitch
on
to
somebody
else
pull
as
they
say
in
boston
at
times
jasper
would
become
weary
of
having
folks
come
along
and
turn
their
private
griefs
over
to
him
but
he
did
not
want
to
become
a
cynic
and
lose
his
faith
in
human
nature
he
was
frequently
stung
but
still
he
could
not
resist
any
appeal
that
was
backed
up
by
a
few
weeps
in
the
course
of
time
he
came
into
quite
a
bundle
of
money
and
then
all
the
bread
that
he
had
cast
on
the
waters
came
back
to
him
a
bakery
at
a
time
those
whom
he
had
succored
came
around
to
sucker
him
illustration
a
promoter
whose
schemes
he
had
guaranteed
because
the
man
children
needed
shoes
now
had
a
chance
to
show
his
gratitude
he
let
jasper
in
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
company
organized
to
manufacture
an
automobile
that
could
be
turned
out
of
the
shop
for
and
would
run
miles
on
a
pint
of
gasoline
gentlemen
who
were
getting
along
without
overcoats
came
in
to
see
him
about
mining
stock
that
was
sure
to
touch
par
by
january
the
only
reason
they
came
to
him
first
instead
of
tackling
john
gates
was
that
he
had
always
been
a
true
friend
and
they
wanted
to
put
him
next
to
a
good
thing
after
one
or
two
of
these
gift
enterprises
had
been
slipped
to
him
he
began
to
back
water
and
be
a
trifle
sore
yet
he
found
it
very
hard
to
be
discourteous
to
one
who
came
in
and
did
the
brother
act
besides
the
bunk
who
has
the
joint
note
already
made
out
and
ready
to
be
signed
usually
has
a
talk
calculated
to
make
a
heart
of
stone
mellow
to
the
consistency
of
a
baked
apple
what
really
did
more
than
any
other
one
thing
to
cure
him
of
his
innate
goodness
was
an
experience
with
a
sweet
girl
who
was
being
courted
by
a
hound
quite
unworthy
of
her

unselfish
benefactor

tries
to
sidetrack

turn
out
unhappily

always
a
candidate
for
the
hospital
with
a
long
shot
at
the
morgue
the
sweet
girl
in
question
was
the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
for
whose
funeral
expenses
he
had
been
landed
she
was
a
confiding
thing
and
did
not
know
that
the
bachelor
who
had
started
in
to
rush
her
seven
nights
a
week
was
a
rounder
and
a
and
somewhat
of
a
lush
every
one
who
knew
the
sweet
girl
said
it
was
too
bad
and
that
some
one
ought
to
go
to
her
and
warn
her
after
the
old
ladies
and
the
elders
had
talked
the
matter
over
on
the
side
it
was
decided
that
jasper
was
it
he
was
known
to
be
kind
and
disinterested
and
was
accustomed
to
dealing
out
good
advice
anything
that
he
said
would
go
a
long
way
to
head
off
the
deal
accordingly
he
did
a
fatherly
talk
to
the
daughter
of
his
old
friend
giving
her
a
straight
line
on
the
conduct
of
the
who
was
trying
to
warm
up
to
her
she
thanked
him
right
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
then
she
sent
a
messenger
boy
to
hunt
up
the
because
she
wanted
to
know
if
it
was
all
true
or
merely
a
cruel
slander
when
she
sprung
his
record
on
him
he
leaned
right
over
against
her
and
cried
and
said
that
no
matter
what
he
had
been
she
was
the
one
to
make
him
a
good
man
then
she
stroked
his
hair
and
begged
forgiveness
and
he
asked
her
who
had
been
knocking
and
she
gave
the
whole
snap
away
and
begged
him
not
to
do
anything
desperate
he
said
that
whatever
he
did
he
would
do
out
of
love
for
her
after
which
he
went
home
to
oil
up
his
pocket
hardware
illustration
next
morning
the
man
who
wanted
to
help
everybody
did
a
flying
leap
down
the
back
stairway
of
his
office
just
as
he
ducked
a
bullet
and
cut
into
the
alley

it
occurred
to
him
that
the
true
friend
gag
had
its
drawbacks
he
escaped
with
his
life
but
there
was
always
more
or
less
dark
talk
of
his
being
mixed
up
in
a
woman

he
is
now
what
is
known

there
was
a
plain
unvarnished
yank
who
made
his
pile
in
a
scrub
town
situated
midday
between
the
oats
belt
and
the
tall
timber
he
was
a
large
and
sandy
mortal
with
a
jaw
and
a
cold
glittering
eye
he
made
his
first
stack
a
dollar
at
a
time
on
straight
deals
but
after
a
while
he
learned
a
few
things
he
organized
stock
companies
and
then
crawled
out
after
hooking
up
with
the
velvet
every
one
called
him
mister
and
treated
him
with
politeness
but
just
the
same
when
he
walked
into
an
office
building
they
all
wondered
what
he
had
come
after
and
there
was
more
or
less
locking
of
safes
it
is
only
fair
to
remark
on
the
side
that
he
would
take
anything
which
was
securely
spiked
down
and
the
grand
jury
never
bothered
him
because
he
worked
under
a
contract
the
financier
was
the
high
centre
pole
of
a
bank
and
a
department
store
and
several
factories
that
gave
young
people
a
start
in
the
world
at
something
like
per
week
he
was
accustomed
to
having
all
the
subordinates
stand
on
one
foot
and
tremble
whenever
he
showed
up
in
fact
he
was
a
very
hefty
proposition
all
through
the
business
district
but
when
he
struck
the
street
leading
to
his
house
he
began
to
reef
his
sails
and
lower
all
of
his
flags
in
his
own
domicile
he
did
not
even
play
second
fiddle
he
simply
trailed
along
at
the
fag
end
of
the
parade
and
carried
the
music
the
piercing
eye
and
the
peremptory
manner
that
caused
all
the
to
fall
off
from
their
high
perches
and
prostrate
themselves
had
no
visible
effect
on
laura
and
the
girls
popsy
was
a
high
guy
at
the
directors
meeting
but
a
mighty
cheap
souffl√©
at
his
own
fireside
any
time
that
his
plans
did
not
coincide
with
those
of
the
feminine
bunch
they
passed
him
a
backhanded
veto
that
would
cause
him
to
lie
quiet
for
days
at
a
time
illustration
the
financier
loved
the
boundless
west
where
the
sack
coat
abounds
and
the
is
a
common
heritage
domestic
cigars
were
good
enough
for
him
and
he
figured
that
one
good
reliable
hired
girl
who
knew
how
to
cook
steak
was
all
the
help
that
was
needed
in
any
house
but
mother
had
seen
fifth
avenue
in
a
dream
and
the
girls
had
attended
a
boarding
school
at
which
nearly
every
one
knew
some
one
who
was
prominent
socially
they
had
done
a
lot
of
hard
work
at
the
piano
and
taken
a
on
the
french
language
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
were
wasting
their
time
in
loitering
on
the
outskirts
of
civilization
when
they
might
be
up
at
headquarters
cutting
more
or
less
of
a
gash
all
the
young
men
in
this
reub
town
wore
derbies
with
their
evening
clothes
and
came
to
dances
with
their
white
gloves
smelling
of
gasoline
in
addition
to
which
they
lacked
repose
if
they
had
stopped
to
cultivate
repose
most
of
them
would
have
landed
in
the
villa
set
aside
for
paupers
when
laura
and
the
girls
first
advocated
pulling
up
stakes
and
doing
a
tall
hike
to
the
east
the
producer
emitted
a
roar
that
would
have
frightened
any
one
except
laura
and
the
girls
they
closed
in
on
him
from
three
directions
and
beat
down
his
defence
when
they
got
through
with
the
living
meal
ticket
he
was
as
meek
as
an
english
servant
and
ready
to
take
orders
from
any
one
so
the
caravansary
moved
away
toward
the
rising
sun
at
wilkesbarre
pennsylvania
the
heavens
opened
and
a
great
light
struck
down
upon
them
transforming
all
except
the
one
who
happened
to
carry
the
letter
of
credit
laura
and
the
girls
suddenly
forgot
that
there
was
any
land
west
of
pittsburg
and
they
dropped
their
r
and
got
the
kangaroo
walk
and
began
to
order
their
food
in
foreign
languages
after
that
all
father
had
to
do
was
to
follow
along
and
look
pleasant
and
dig
every
few
minutes
the
outfit
stopped
at
the
waldorf
three
days
so
as
to
obtain
a
residence
and
after
that
they
registered
as
being
from
new
york
then
they
threw
papa
on
a
boat
and
took
him
to
the
other
side
the
place
where
americans
are
so
popular
if
you
do
care
what
you
say
by
paying
off
the
mortgage
they
obtained
a
suite
at
a
hotel
patronized
by
the
nobility
and
gentry
and
supported
by
people
from
iowa
after
which
they
began
to
present
letters
of
introduction
and
try
to
butt
in
laura
and
the
girls
felt
that
if
only
they
could
eat
a
meal
once
or
twice
in
the
gloomy
presence
of
those
who
had
handles
to
their
names
they
would
be
ready
to
fall
back
and
die
happy
they
had
some
trouble
about
getting
into
the
tall
game
on
account
of
their
money
in
the
states
the
general
run
of
people
worship
the
almighty
dollar
but
in
england
they
hate
the
sight
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
sinfully
rich
they
succeeded
in
elbowing
their
way
into
several
dinners
at
which
it
was
necessary
to
put
ice
into
the
claret
in
order
to
keep
it
at
the
temperature
of
the

the
financier
in
his
first
part

with
an
weskit
was
a
picture
that
no
artist
could
paint
his
hair
would
not
stay
combed
and
he
hardly
ever
knew
what
to
do
with
his
hands
illustration
laura
and
the
girls
could
forget
that
they
had
once
seen
the
missouri
river
but
not
so
with
old
ready
money
right
at
the
table
sitting
opposite
the
earl
of
hammersmith
or
the
marquis
of
while
laura
and
the
girls
would
be
talking
about
their
country
place
and
trying
to
smother
the
american
accent
the
lobsterine
would
come
in
and
tell
about
something
that
happened
to
him
once
when
he
was
plowing
corn
then
laura
and
the
girls
would
want
to
duck
right
under
the
table
and
die
of
mortification
then
and
there
the
only
reason
they
put
up
with
him
was
that
he
seemed
to
be
useful
when
it
came
to
signing
checks
in
england
they
met
a
great
many
nice
people
the
financier
knew
that
they
were
nice
because
they
wore
dark
clothes
and
seldom
smiled
then
the
two
shapely
daughters
went
and
married
a
couple
of
titles
the
financier
had
the
novel
experience
of
putting
up
for
a
brace
of
who
would
not
speak
to
him
when
any
one
was
around
which
served
him
right
for
he
had
no
business
to
be
in
trade
it
was
very
careless
of
him
not
to
have
inherited
his
stuff
still
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
him
to
be
a
blood
relative
of
two
howling
swells
who
had
pedigrees
reaching
back
almost
as
far
as
their
debts
very
often
he
would
take
them
into
a
back
room
and
turn
them
around
and
look
them
over
and
recognize
the
cold
undeniable
fact
that
they
were
cheap
at
any
price
moral
bunker
hill
has
been
avenged
over
and
over
hezekiah
and
his
message
of
hope
to
this
years
crop
of
in
wayback
township
along
in
the
thirties
there
arrived
a
when
he
was
three
days
old
he
was
exhibited
to
a
bunch
in
the
front
room
by
an
old
lady
who
had
made
a
study
of
colic
she
was
a
baby
expert
who
always
broke
in
to
do
considerable
heavy
standing
around
and
calling
off
when
there
was
a
lift
in
the
population
while
little
was
being
inspected
he
opened
one
eye
and
spotted
a
silver
that
the
honorary
nurse
wore
as
a
brooch
immediately
he
closed
in
on
it
they
had
to
choke
him
to
make
him
let
go
in
after
years
it
was
remarked
that
this
was
the
only
time
that
he
went
after
the
coin
and
failed
to
bring
it
home
the
baby
never
had
any
tantrums
at
night
because
he
had
overheard
them
say
that
it
cost
every
time
doc
was
called
in
he
would
lie
quietly
in
his
crib
for
hours
at
a
time
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
and
computing
compound
interest
on
the
gold
piece
that
had
been
put
in
the
bank
to
be
drawn
out
when
he
should
be

parents

him
a
biblical
name
so
so
as
to
make
him
a
strong
for
investors
who
belong
to
the
pious
element
hezekiah
hooper
is
what
they
christened
him
they
wanted
a
name
that
would
carry
weight
on
a
and
reassure
the
soft
mark
who
was
about
to
sink
his
funds
in
a
mining
venture
with
a
guarantee
of
per
cent
dividends
at
the
age
of
hezekiah
sat
down
and
figured
that
if
he
devoted
his
life
to
physical
toil
he
might
some
day
be
the
owner
of
a
cottage
fully
protected
by
a
mortgage
whereas
if
he
wore
a
white
shirt
and
kept
busy
with
the
pencil
he
might
be
rich
enough
some
day
to
land
in
the
senate
so
he
went
out
looking
for
work
to
hand
to
other
people
thus
becoming
what
the
campaign
orator
calls
a
captain
of
industry
if
a
man
wanted
the
weeds
pulled
from
his
garden
then
hez
would
take
the
job
for
cents
he
would
buy
cents
worth
of
stick
candy
and
place
it
judiciously
so
that
at
nightfall
the
other
boys
would
have
blisters
and
the
while
hez
would
have
cents
salted
away
in
the
tin
bank
when
he
was
still
a
young
man
he
made
the
important
discovery
that
the
honest
laborer
who
digs
for
hours
at
a
stretch
gets
in
the
currency
of
the
realm
while
the
who
leads
out
a
spavined
horse
and
puts
in
minutes
at
tall
bunko
work
can
clean
up
and
then
sit
on
the
porch
all

reading
the
lives
of
the
saints

hezekiah
led
up
to
the
altar
a
whose
eyes
refused
to
work
as
a
duet
and
whose
figure
had
all
of
the
graceful
ins
and
outs
of
a
but
she
owned
half
of
the
land
in
the
township
hezekiah
said
something
about
the
beauty
that
fadeth
even
as
a
flower
and
then
he
connected
with
her
property
illustration
when
war
showed
its
awful
front
hezekiah
went
down
to
the
and
hollered
for
the
union
until
he
was
black
in
the
face
he
showed
all
the
emotional
farm
hands
where
to
sign
their
names
and
promised
to
keep
them
supplied
with
blue
overcoats
beans
navy
plug

hard
tack
until
the
whole
works
had
been
saved
every
time
there
was
a
new
call
for
men
he
took
a
firmer
hold
on
the
commissary
department
and
began
to
gouge
the
government
in
a
new
place
the
heroes
who
came
home
full
of
malaria
and
lead
were
met
at
the
station
by
hezekiah
who
had
grown
a
chin

and
was
sporting
a
white
vest
he
gave
each
one
a
card
announcing
that
all
of

defenders
who
had
failed
to
become

put

over

stuff

and
handing

end

arrived
at

proud
eminence
hezekiah
was
ripe
to
spring
some
advice
to
young
men
any

has
slipped

mitt
to
the

it
comes
to
laying
down
rules
of
conduct
for
the
pale
youth
who
wants
an
job
so
hezekiah
hooper
the
eminent
financier
who
never
smoked
a
cigar
never
took
a
drink
and
never
asked
anybody
else
to
do
either
was
invited
to
address
the
class
of
at
the
local
business
college
he
sat
on
the
rostrum
wearing
black
broadcloth
betokening
virtue
and
in
addition
to
his
ancient
the
white
shirt
and
the
white
vest
he
had
a
white
bow
tie
as
he
sat
there
in
conscious
rectitude
wondering
if
the
congressional
investigation
would
harm
the
beef
trust
it
could
be
seen
at
a
glance
that
he
would
never
take
anything
that
was
too
heavy
to
carry
unless
he
had
a
dray
the
studious
young
gentlemen
who
had
been
preparing
themselves
to
go
out
into
the
great
world
and
draw
as
and
stenographers
looked
up
at
honest
hezekiah
and
said
this
is
where
he
puts
us
next
to
the
recipe
for
getting
there
at
last
the
honored
guest
arose
and
told
the
class
that
the
young
man
who
wishes
to
succeed
must
be
upright
frugal
industrious
and
patriotic
he
considered
it
the
duty
of
every
young
man
to
accept
whatever
compensation
was
offered
him
and
be
content
for
as
soon
as
he
began
to
earn
more
his
employer
would
come
around
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
above
all
he
must
love
his
country
and
let
integrity
be
his
watchword
and
remember
that
a
good
name
is
better
than
riches
even
if
other
people
do
think
so
then
he
sat
down
without
batting
an
eye
and
every
member
of
the
class
of
knew
just
how
to
go
out
and
pile
up
a
million
moral
what
more
they
believe
it
themselves
girl
who
took
notes
and
got
wise
and
then
fell
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
girl
who
used
to
sit
in
her
own
room
on
rainy
afternoons
and
evolve
theories
her
principal
ambition
in
life
was
to
stand
ace
high
with
all
the
nice
men
of
her
set
she
hoped
in
the
course
of
time
to
tease
one
away
from
the
drove
and
gallop
him
into
the
branding
pen
now
this
girl
was
so
foxy
that
at
times
she
got
in
front
of
herself
and
blocked
off
her
own
plays
her
scheme
for
getting
all
the
real
boys
intoxified
with
love
for
her
was
to
engage
them
in
conversation
and
find
out
what
kind
of
girls
they
liked
then
her
play
was
to
be
that
kind
she
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
inducing
her
men
friends
to
talk
about
the
opposite
sex
they
were
all
keyed
up
on
the
subject
and
full
of
information
just
as
a
feeler
one
evening
she
asked
an
eligible
charley
if
he
did
think
that
the
woman
of
was
too
extravagant
that
just
why
so
many
of
us
shy
at
the
matrimonial
jump
he
confided
to
her
there
was
a
time
when
the
man
who
got
per
month
and
had
about
planted
could
take
a
chance
at
the
game
but
now
that
measly
allowance
would
keep
a
high
roller
supplied
with
violets
the
maudine
is
happy
unless
she
has
a
coat
an
auto
car
worth
of
twinklers
and
a
apartment
that
why
these
society
keep
on
making
love
right
and
left
but
never
come
down
to
cases
this
was
a
valuable
tip
so
the
crafty
maiden
put
it
down
in
her
little
that
she
who
would
make
a
hit
must
convince
the
men
that
her
tastes
were
simple
and
inexpensive
another
one
gave
her
a
learned
talk
on
the
frivolity
and
of
the
typical
seraphine
illustration
you
can
not
expect
a
man
to
hand
over
his
serious
affections
to
one
of
these
he
said
as
he
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
floor
woman
should
be
man
intellectual
helpmeet
now
and
then
a
man
may
have
a
passing
fancy
for
a
lizzie
who
talks
piffle
and
gets
an
attack
of
the
giggles
every
few
seconds
but
when
it
comes
to
the
grand
he
wants
one
who
is
there
with
the
gray
matter
one
who
can
play
up
to
his
loftiest
ambitions
and
supply
his
home
with
that
atmosphere
of
culture
which
is
the
true
ozone
of
married
life
so
she
put
it
down
that
it
was
her
cue
to
chop
out
the
twaddle
and
be
a
sort
of
lady
emerson
incidentally
she
resolved
to
cut
out
all
kinds
of
slang
for
she
got
a
very
straight
line
of
talk
from
an
amateur
philosopher
who
was
in
the
wholesale
grocery
business
if
there
anything
that
gives
me
a
quick
shooting
pain
it
is
to
hear
some
delicate
nectarine
dealing
out
slang
said
mr
gentleman
friend
now
in
england
where
i
spent
two
weeks
once
the
ladies
never
use
slang
they
simply
say
that
a
thing
is
either
perfectly
charming
or
most
extraordinary
and
let
it
go
at
that
they
may
be
short
on
vocabulary
but
they
are
long
on
respectability
besides
i
was
reading
in
a
magazine
the
other
day
that
slang
is
vulgar
and
that
no
one
should
take
up
with
a
slang
word
until
long
usage
has
given
it
the
right
to
break
into
the
lexicon
illustration
of
also
this
girl
with
the
absorbent
mind
would
clip
out
hints
to
the
young
and
confidential
charts
warning
the
against
taking
presents
from
strangers
and
putting
them
next
to
rules
of
conduct
that
would
be
sure
to
please
and
fascinate
proper
young
men
it
seemed
strange
at
times
that
these
head
coaches
who
knew
just
how
to
jolly
up
any
man
were
not
out
spending
some
millionaire
money
instead
of
writing
pieces
for
the
paper
all
the
articles
on
the
woman
page
and
all
the
men
that
she
met
came
down
hard
on
the
female
who
is
trying
to
be
a
real
bohemian
she
learned
from
a
dozen
different
sources
that
men
have
no
earthly
use
for
the
zipper
who
tries
to
do
a
mile
in
less
than
two
and
kites
around
in
a
hack
without
a
chaperon
and
carries
her
own
cigarettes
and
she
heard
nothing
but
expressions
of
horror
concerning
the
woman
who
drinks
her
male
acquaintances
often
brought
up
the
painful
subject
they
said
it
was
all
right
for
a
man
to
move
up
to
a
high
ball
once
in
a
while
and
a
cocktail
before
dinner
did
do
any
harm
until
after
the
seventh
or
eighth
but
it
did
look
tough
to
see
mere
children
of
about
years
of
age
going
after
the
dry
manhattans
after
sounding
the
men
on
the
liquor
question
the
girl
made
a
solemn
resolve
that
she
would
never
hit
up
anything
stronger
than
cherry
sundae
when
she
had
her
note
book
full
of
useful
directions
she
found
a
chance
to
try
out
her
system
she
was
invited
to
a
swell
dinner
party
at
which
all
the
nice
men
in
town
were
to
be
rounded
up
she
put
on
a
simple
white
gown
and
wore
a
rose
in
her
hair
and
just
before
starting
she
locked
all
of
her
slang
words
in
the
escritoire
whatever
that
may
be
at
the
dinner
she
sat
next
to
a
bachelor
who
had
nothing
but
she
talked
to
him
about
the
panama
canal
just
to
show
that
she
was
no
piker
when
he
wanted
her
to
take
some
of
the
phizz
water
she
made
an
awful
stand
and
seemed
surprised
that
he
should
think
that
of
her
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
splashing
in
by
the
time
the
birds
came
along
he
had
accumulated
a
very
neat
brannigan
and
was
paying
a
lot
of
attention
to
a
wonderful
piece
of
work
sitting
opposite
she
wore
a
red
costume
that
must
have
cost
and
although
she
was
very
gabby
and
called
the
men
by
their
first
names
and
invited
all
who
were
not
quitters
to
stand
by
for
a
bumper
she
was
making
fair
headway
in
fact
she
seemed
to
have
the
bunch
with
her
the
wise
girl
figured
that
they
were
tolerating
her
out
of
mere
politeness
later
on
in
the
drawing
room
they
continued
to
tolerate
her
the
best
they
knew
how
the
girl
with
the
book
of
rules
played
a
sad
little
opus
on
the
piano
after
which
the
in
red
leaped
on
top
of
the
instrument
and
tore
out
coon
stuff
with
eight
men
turning
the
music
for
her
and
these
were
the
eight
who
had
told
the
girl
back
in
the
corner
all
about
the
qualities
in
woman
that
would
help
to
attract
men
she
went
home
thinking
it
over
and
the
next
time
she
started
for
a
dinner
she
added
a
dash
of
red
and
a
few
brilliants
to
the
costume
and
cut
loose
up
to
a
reasonable
limit
she
got
along
even
though
she
was
doing
a
lot
of
things
that
none
of
the
men
approve
but
somehow
love
to
put
up
with
moral
he
can
always
pick
out
the
right
kind
for
the
other
fellow
they
had
laid
out
for
their

man
who
had
three
weeks
of
vacation
coming
to
him
began
to
get
busy
with
an
atlas
about
april
he
and
his
wife
figured
that
by
keeping
on
the
jump
they
could
do
niagara
thousand
islands
atlantic
city
the
mammoth
cave
and
cover
the
great
lakes
on
april
they
decided
to
charter
a

float
down
the
mississippi
on
april
he
heard
of
a
cheap
excursion
to
california
with
a
privilege
at
every
station
and
they
began
to
read
up
on
salt
lake
and
yellowstone
on
may
she
flashed
a
prospectus
of
a
northern
lake
resort
where
boats
and
minnows
were
free
and
nature
was
ever
smiling
by
may
he
had
drawn
a
blue
pencil
all
over
a
folder
of
the
adirondack
region
and
all
the
hotel
rates
were
set
down
in
his
pocket
memorandum
book

busy
with
an
ten
days
later
she
vetoed
the
mountain
trip
because
she
had
got
next
to
a
nantucket
establishment
where
family
board
was
a
week
with
the
use
of
a
horse
on
june
a
friend
showed
him
how
by
making
two
changes
and
hiring
a
canoe
he
could
penetrate
the
deep
woods
where
the
foot
of
man
had
never
trod
and
the
black
bass
came
to
the
surface
and
begged
to
be
taken
out
on
june
he
and
wifey
packed
up
and
did
the
annual
hike
up
to
uncle
foster
place
in
brown
county
where
they
ate
with
the
hired
hand
and
had
greens
three
times
a
day
there
were
no
screens
on
the
windows
but
by
climbing
a
hill
they
could
get
a
lovely
view
of
the
pike

ran

wife
had
three
sons
the
first
named
abraham
lincoln
tibbetts
was
born
in
his
name
was
promptly
abbreviated
to
link
the
second
who
arrived
in
was
christened
ulysses
simpson
grant
tibbetts
this
was
too
long
so
people
called
him
chub
the
third
was
of
the
vintage
of
and
his
name
went
into
the
register
as
chester
arthur
tibbetts
but
in
the
interest
of
euphony
he
was
dubbed
art
because
art
is
long
the
tibbetts
family
lived
in
the
city
and
link
the
enjoyed
all
the
advantages
of
life
in
an
apartment
building
he
went
to
a
graded
school
and
picked
up
so
much
knowledge
that
at
the
age
of
he
could
set
his
parents
down
in
front
of
him
and
tell
them
things
they
did
not
know
at
he
was
so
far
along
that
he
knew
how
to
lie
in
bed
and
have
his
mother
bring
his
breakfast
up
to
him
he
went
to
dancing
school
and
learned
to
play
all
the
pinafore
music
on
the
upright
agony
box
sometimes
he
chided
and
tibbetts
for
not
having
as
much
money
as
many
of
the
people
he
met
at
dancing
parties
he
had
about
as
much
application
as
a
porous
plaster
and
he
worried
more
about
his
complexion
than
he
did
about
his
business
prospects
tibbetts
gave
him
a
desk
at
the
office
and
called
him
assistant
something
his
duties
consisted
of
looking
at
the
clock
and
writing
notes
to
the
gazelles
he
had
met
the
night
before
if
he
had
been
set
out
on
the
pavement
and
told
to
root
for
himself
it
would
have
broken
him
of
the
habit
of
eating
link
was
whatever
they
called
a
lobster
in
tibbetts
realized
that
city
life
had
an
enervating
effect
on
boys
and
made
them
superficial
and
wise
in
their
own
conceit
illustration
chub
was
years
old
and
had
not
yet
succumbed
to
the
matinee
habit
so
his
parents
decided
to
ship
him
out
to
the
green
fields
and
keep
him
there
until
he
had
developed
a
character
and
tibbetts
knew
that
all
the
men
of
sterling
worth
mentioned
in
political
biographies
had
been
raised
on
the
farm
they
figured
that
if
chub
could
be
left
in
the
country
to
run
with
the
live
stock
he
would
grow
up
to
be
a
sturdy
and
character
with
no
hankering
for
soda
water
and
the
military
schottische
therefore
chub
was
sent
out
to
live
with
uncle
jabez
quackenbush
an
agriculturalist
who
owned
acres
and
was
still
wearing
the
army
overcoat
that
the
government
had
given
him
when
the
war
broke
out
chub
slept
on
a
feather
tick
up
in
a
room
where
they
had
the
seed
corn
hung
on
the
rafters
uncle
jabe
would
yank
him
out
at
and
keep
him
in
the
field
until
the
early
so
that
usually
he
had
two
meals
in
the
dark
on
sunday
he
and
the
hired
help
would
sit
in
the
and
read
almanacs
in
the
winter
he
attended
a
district
school
and
learned
to
bound
patagonia
but
he
did
not
go
to
any
demoralizing
shows
nor
learn
to
pick
up
flip
slang
illustration
when
he
was
he
seemed
to
be
past
the
danger
period
so
uncle
jabe
took
him
to
the
train
and
told
the
conductor
where
to
put
him
off
on
the
way
back
to
the
city
he
bought
an
oval
box
of
figs
from
the
train
boy
and
lost
his
hat
out
of
the
window
when
he
arrived
at
home
and
entered
the
house
it
sounded
like
a
crowd
coming
in
his
mother
took
one
look
and
fell
backward
there
was
a
neutral
zone
between
his
vest
and
trousers
also
he
had
been
raising
warts
on
himself
for
two
months
after
he
arrived
they
kept
him
under
cover
for
fear
the
neighbors
would
see
him
he
gave
way
at
the
knees
every
time
he
stepped
if
a
member
of
the
opposite
sex
spoke
to
him
he
usually
backed
into
something
breakable
at
the
table
he
did
a
act
and
drank
out
of
the
saucer
we
made
a
mistake
in
leaving
him
so
long
in
the
tall
grass
said
tibbetts
but
now
that
we
have
tried
the
two
extremes
we
know
just
what
to
do
with
art
we
shall
send
him
to
a
small
town
where
he
may
associate
with
bright
youth
of
his
own
age
and
yet
be
away
from
the
distracting
and
corrupting
influences
of
the
big
city
accordingly
art
was
farmed
out
to
a
cousin
residing
in
a
drowsy
corporation
of
about
souls
figuratively
speaking
he
went
to
the
grammar
school
and
what
he
did
learn
at
school
he
learned
in
back
alleys
and
box
cars
however
his
parents
were
happy
in
the
knowledge
that
he
was
beyond
the
influence
of
the
gaudy
play
house
the
gilded
buffet
and
the
seductive
dancing
academy
he
was
out
where
nothing
happened
unless
the
boys
started
it
themselves
so
they
started
it
when
he
was
twenty
he
was
sent
to
the
city
an
extra
fine
specimen
of
what
the
small
town
can
produce
he
had
his
hair
combed
down
into
his
eyes
he
wore
a
punky
little
derby
about
two
sizes
too
small
the
collar
was
four
inches
high
and
he
wore
a
cravat
with
a
copper
butterfly
for
a
furthermore
he
had
a
suit
of
clothes
that
was
intended
for
a
gentle
brakeman
on
his
lapel
he
had
a
button
photograph
of
the
girl
who
worked
in
the
millinery
store

you
made
up

masquerade
or
is
this
the
regular

asked
his
father
back
and
set
down

knew
his

repartee

was
on

gags
what
do

yourself
asked
tibbetts
i
want
to
travel
with
a
circus
or
minstrel
troupe
and
i
do
much
care
which
replied
art
as
the
boy
appeared
to
be
somewhat
lumpy
about
the
pockets
his
father
threw
him
down
and
searched
him
finding
on

person
a
revolver
a
package
of
cigaroots
