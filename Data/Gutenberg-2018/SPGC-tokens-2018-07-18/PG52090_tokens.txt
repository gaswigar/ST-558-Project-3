the

text
presented
in
this

is
taken
from
that
of
a
leyden
edition
of
in

words
from
that
of
an
edition
published
in
the

and
in
the
place
of
issue
of
the
first
edition
the
title
page
of
this
edition
is
reproduced
in
the
present
volume
the
original
was
evidently
the
work
of
a
dutch
compositor
unschooled
in
the
french
language
and
is
full
of
imperfections
inconsistencies
and
grammatical
blunders
by
the
direction
of
the
publishers
these
obviously
typographical
blunders
have
been
corrected
by
lucien
arréat
of
paris
the
translation
is
the
work
of
several
hands
it
is
founded
on
a
version
made
by
miss
gertrude
bussey
from
the
french
text
in
the
edition
of
assezat
and
has
been
revised
by
professor
calkins
who
is
responsible
for
it
in
its
present
form
mademoiselle
carret
of
the
wellesley
college
department
of
french
and
professor
george
santayana
of
harvard
university
have
given
valued
assistance
and
this
opportunity
is
taken
to
acknowledge
their
kindness
in
solving
the
problems
of
interpretation
which
have
been
submitted
to
them
it
should
be
added
that
the
translation
sometimes
subordinates
the
claims
of
english
structure
and
style
in
the
effort
to
render
la
meaning
exactly
the
paragraphing
of
the
french
is
usually
followed
but
the
italics
and
the
capitals
are
not
reproduced
the

the
great
eulogy
on
julien

de
la
mettrie
julien
offray
de
la
mettrie
was
born
in
saint
malo
on
the
of
december
to
julien
offray
de
la
mettrie
and
marie
gaudron
who
were
living
by
a
trade
large
enough
to
provide
a
good
education
for
their
son
they
sent
him
to
the
college
of
coutance
to
study
the
humanities
he
went
from
there
to
paris
to
the
college
of
plessis
he
studied
his
rhetoric
at
caen
and
since
he
had
much
genius
and
imagination
he
won
all
the
prizes
for
eloquence
he
was
a
born
orator
and
was
passionately
fond
of
poetry
and
but
his
father
thought
that
he
would
earn
more
as
an
ecclesiastic
than
as
a
poet
and
destined
him
for
the
church
he
sent
him
the
following
year
to
the
college
of
plessis
where
he
studied
logic
under
cordier
who
was
more
a
jansenist
than
a
logician
it
is
characteristic
of
an
ardent
imagination
to
seize
forcefully
the
objects
presented
to
it
as
it
is
characteristic
of
youth
to
be
prejudiced
in
favor
of
the
first
opinions
that
are
inculcated
any
other
scholar
would
have
adopted
the
opinions
of
his
teacher
but
that
was
not
enough
for
young
la
mettrie
he
became
a
jansenist
and
wrote
a
work
which
had
great
vogue
in
that
party
in
he
studied
natural
philosophy
at
the
college
of
harcourt
and
made
great
progress
there
on
his
return
to
brittany
hunault
a
doctor
of
saint
malo
had
advised
him
to
adopt
the
medical
profession
they
had
persuaded
his
father
assuring
him
that
a
mediocre
physician
would
be
better
paid
for
his
remedies
than
a
good
priest
for
absolutions
at
first
young
la
mettrie
had
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
anatomy
for
two
years
he
had
worked
at
the
after
this
in
he
took
the
degree
of
doctor
at
rheims
and
was
there
received
as
a
physician
in
he
went
to
leyden
to
study
under
the
famous
boerhaave
the
master
was
worthy
of
the
scholar
and
the
scholar
soon
made
himself
worthy
of
the
master
la
mettrie
devoted
all
the
acuteness
of
his
mind
to
the
knowledge
and
to
the
healing
of
human
infirmities
and
he
soon
became
a
great
physician
in
the
year
during
his
leisure
moments
he
translated
a
treatise
of
the
late
boerhaave
his
aphrodisiacus
and
joined
to
it
a
dissertation
on
venereal
maladies
of
which
he
himself
was
the
author
the
old
physicians
in
france
rose
up
against
a
scholar
who
affronted
them
by
knowing
as
much
as
they
one
of
the
most
celebrated
doctors
of
paris
did
him
the
honor
of
criticizing
his
work
a
sure
proof
that
it
was
good
la
mettrie
replied
and
to
confound
his
adversary
still
more
he
composed
in
a
treatise
on
vertigo
esteemed
by
all
impartial
physicians
by
an
unfortunate
effect
of
human
imperfection
a
certain
base
jealousy
has
come
to
be
one
of
the
characteristics
of
men
of
letters
this
feeling
incites
those
who
have
reputations
to
oppose
the
progress
of
budding
geniuses
this
blight
often
fastens
on
talents
without
destroying
them
but
it
sometimes
injures
them
la
mettrie
who
was
advancing
in
the
career
of
science
at
a
giant
pace
suffered
from
this
jealousy
and
his
quick
temper
made
him
too
susceptible
to
it
in
saint
malo
he
translated
the
aphorisms
of
boerhaave
the
materia
medica
the
chemical
proceedings
the
chemical
theory
and
the
institutions
by
this
same
author
about
the
same
time
he
published
an
abstract
of
sydenham
the
young
doctor
had
learned
by
premature
experience
that
if
he
wished
to
live
in
peace
it
was
better
to
translate
than
to
compose
but
it
is
characteristic
of
genius
to
escape
from
reflection
counting
on
himself
alone
if
i
may
speak
thus
and
filled
with
the
knowledge
he
had
gained
from
his
infinitely
skilful
researches
into
nature
he
wished
to
communicate
to
the
public
the
useful
discoveries
he
had
made
he
published
his
treatise
on
smallpox
his
practical
medicine
and
six
volumes
of
commentary
on
the
physiology
of
boerhaave
all
these
works
appeared
at
paris
although
the
author
had
written
them
at
saint
malo
he
joined
to
the
theory
of
his
art
an
always
successful
practice
which
is
no
small
recommendation
for
a
physician
in
la
mettrie
came
to
paris
led
there
by
the
death
of
hunault
his
old
teacher
morand
and
sidobre
introduced
him
to
the
duke
of
gramont
who
a
few
days
after
obtained
for
him
the
commission
of
physician
of
the
guards
he
accompanied
the
duke
to
war
and
was
with
him
at
the
battle
of
dettingen
at
the
siege
of
freiburg
and
at
the
battle
of
fontenoy
where
he
lost
his
patron
who
was
killed
by
a
cannon
shot
la
mettrie
felt
this
loss
all
the
more
keenly
because
it
was
at
the
same
time
the
reef
on
which
his
fortune
was
wrecked
this
is
what
happened
during
the
campaign
of
freiburg
la
mettrie
had
an
attack
of
violent
fever
for
a
philosopher
an
illness
is
a
school
of
physiology
he
believed
that
he
could
clearly
see
that
thought
is
but
a
consequence
of
the
organization
of
the
machine
and
that
the
disturbance
of
the
springs
has
considerable
influence
on
that
part
of
us
which
the
metaphysicians
call
soul
filled
with
these
ideas
during
his
convalescence
he
boldly
bore
the
torch
of
experience
into
the
night
of
metaphysics
he
tried
to
explain
by
the
aid
of
anatomy
the
thin
texture
of
understanding
and
he
found
only
mechanism
where
others
had
supposed
an
essence
superior
to
matter
he
had
his
philosophic
conjectures
printed
under
the
title
of
the
natural
history
of
the
soul
the
chaplain
of
the
regiment
sounded
the
tocsin
against
him
and
at
first
sight
all
the
devotees
cried
out
against
him
the
common
ecclesiastic
is
like
don
quixote
who
found
marvelous
adventures
in
commonplace
events
or
like
the
famous
soldier
so
engrossed
with
his
system
that
he
found
columns
in
all
the
books
he
read
the
majority
of
priests
examine
all
works
of
literature
as
if
they
were
treatises
on
theology
and
filled
with
this
one
aim
they
discover
heresies
everywhere
to
this
fact
are
due
very
many
false
judgments
and
very
many
accusations
for
the
most
part
unfair
against
the
authors
a
book
of
physics
should
be
read
in
the
spirit
of
a
physicist
nature
the
truth
is
its
sole
judge
and
should
absolve
or
condemn
it
a
book
of
astronomy
should
be
read
in
the
same
manner
if
a
poor
physician
proves
that
the
blow
of
a
stick
smartly
rapped
on
the
skull
disturbs
the
mind
or
that
at
a
certain
degree
of
heat
reason
wanders
one
must
either
prove
the
contrary
or
keep
quiet
if
a
skilful
astronomer
proves
in
spite
of
joshua
that
the
earth
and
all
the
celestial
globes
revolve
around
the
sun
one
must
either
calculate
better
than
he
or
admit
that
the
earth
revolves
but
the
theologians
who
by
their
continual
apprehension
might
make
the
weak
believe
that
their
cause
is
bad
are
not
troubled
by
such
a
small
matter
they
insisted
on
finding
seeds
of
heresy
in
a
work
dealing
with
physics
the
author
underwent
a
frightful
persecution
and
the
priests
claimed
that
a
doctor
accused
of
heresy
could
not
cure
the
french
guards
to
the
hatred
of
the
devotees
was
joined
that
of
his
rivals
for
glory
this
was
rekindled
by
a
work
of
la
mettrie
entitled
the
politics
of
physicians
a
man
full
of
cunning
and
carried
away
by
ambition
aspired
to
the
place
then
vacant
of
first
physician
to
the
king
of
france
he
thought
that
he
could
gain
it
by
heaping
ridicule
upon
those
of
his
contemporaries
who
might
lay
claim
to
this
position
he
wrote
a
libel
against
them
and
abusing
the
easy
friendship
of
la
mettrie
he
enticed
him
to
lend
to
it
the
volubility
of
his
pen
and
the
richness
of
his
imagination
nothing
more
was
needed
to
complete
the
downfall
of
a
man
little
known
against
whom
were
all
appearances
and
whose
only
protection
was
his
merit
for
having
been
too
sincere
as
a
philosopher
and
too
obliging
as
a
friend
la
mettrie
was
compelled
to
leave
his
country
the
duke
of
duras
and
the
viscount
of
chaila
advised
him
to
flee
from
the
hatred
of
the
priests
and
the
revenge
of
the
physicians
therefore
in
he
left
the
hospitals
of
the
army
where
he
had
been
placed
by
sechelles
and
came
to
leyden
to
philosophize
in
peace
he
there
composed
his
penelope
a
polemical
work
against
the
physicians
in
which
after
the
fashion
of
democritus
he
made
fun
of
the
vanity
of
his
profession
the
curious
result
was
that
the
doctors
themselves
though
their
quackery
was
painted
in
true
colors
could
not
help
laughing
when
they
read
it
and
that
is
a
sure
sign
that
they
had
found
more
wit
than
malice
in
it
la
mettrie
after
losing
sight
of
his
hospitals
and
his
patients
gave
himself
up
completely
to
speculative
philosophy
he
wrote
his
man
a
machine
or
rather
he
put
on
paper
some
vigorous
thoughts
about
materialism
which
he
doubtless
planned
to
rewrite
this
work
which
was
bound
to
displease
men
who
by
their
position
are
declared
enemies
of
the
progress
of
human
reason
roused
all
the
priests
of
leyden
against
its
author
calvinists
catholics
and
lutherans
forgot
for
the
time
that
consubstantiation
free
will
mass
for
the
dead
and
the
infallibility
of
the
pope
divided
them
they
all
united
again
to
persecute
a
philosopher
who
had
the
additional
misfortune
of
being
french
at
a
time
when
that
monarchy
was
waging
a
successful
war
against
their
high
powers
the
title
of
philosopher
and
the
reputation
of
being
unfortunate
were
enough
to
procure
for
la
mettrie
a
refuge
in
prussia
with
a
pension
from
the
king
he
came
to
berlin
in
the
month
of
february
in
the
year
he
was
there
received
as
a
member
of
the
royal
academy
of
science
medicine
reclaimed
him
from
metaphysics
and
he
wrote
a
treatise
on
dysentery
another
on
asthma
the
best
that
had
then
been
written
on
these
cruel
diseases
he
sketched
works
on
certain
philosophical
subjects
which
he
had
proposed
to
look
into
by
a
sequence
of
accidents
which
befell
him
these
works
were
stolen
but
he
demanded
their
suppression
as
soon
as
they
appeared
la
mettrie
died
in
the
house
of
milord
tirconnel
minister
plenipotentiary
of
france
whose
life
he
had
saved
it
seems
that
the
disease
knowing
with
whom
it
had
to
deal
was
clever
enough
to
attack
his
brain
first
so
that
it
would
more
surely
confound
him
he
had
a
burning
fever
and
was
violently
delirious
the
invalid
was
obliged
to
depend
upon
the
science
of
his
colleagues
and
he
did
not
find
there
the
resources
which
he
had
so
often
found
in
his
own
both
for
himself
and
for
the
public
he
died
on
the
eleventh
of
november
at
the
age
of
years
he
had
married
louise
charlotte
dréano
by
whom
he
left
only
a
daughter
five
years
and
a
few
months
old
la
mettrie
was
born
with
a
fund
of
natural
and
inexhaustible
gaiety
he
had
a
quick
mind
and
such
a
fertile
imagination
that
it
made
flowers
grow
in
the
field
of
medicine
nature
had
made
him
an
orator
and
a
philosopher
but
a
yet
more
precious
gift
which
he
received
from
her
was
a
pure
soul
and
an
obliging
heart
all
those
who
are
not
imposed
upon
by
the
pious
insults
of
the
theologians

la
nature
comme
de
la
révélation
il
nous
a
donné
pour
expliquer
et
la
raison
pour
les
accorder
ensemble
se
défier
des
connaissances
peut
puiser
dans
les
corps
animés
regarder
la
nature
et
la
révélation
comme
deux
contraires
qui
se
détruisent
et
par
conséquent
oser
soutenir
cette
absurdité
que
dieu
se
contredit
dans
ses
divers
ouvrages
et
nous
trompe
y
a
une
révélation
elle
ne
peut
donc
démentir
la
nature
par
la
nature
seule
on
peut
découvrir
le
sens
des
paroles
de
dont
seule
est
la
véritable
interprète
en
effet
les
autres
commentateurs
fait
la
vérité
nous
allons
en
juger
par
du
spectacle
de
la
nature
il
est
étonnant
au
sujet
de
locke
homme
qui
dégrade
notre
âme
la
croire
une
âme
de
boue
ose
établir
la
raison
pour
juge
et
souverain
arbitre
des
mystères
de
la
foi
car
quelle
idée
étonnante
du
christianisme
si
voulait
suivre
la
raison
outre
que
ces
réflexions
rien
par
rapport
à
la
foi
elles
forment
de
si
frivoles
objections
contre
la
méthode
de
ceux
qui
croient
pouvoir
interpréter
les
livres
saints
que
presque
honte
de
perdre
le
temps
à
les
réfuter
de
la
raison
ne
dépend
pas
grand
mot
vide
de
sens
mais
de
sa
force
de
son
étendue
ou
de
sa
clairvoyance
ainsi
une
âme
de
boue
qui
découvrirait
comme
coup
les
rapports
et
les
suites
infinité
difficiles
à
saisir
serait
évidemment
préférable
à
une
âme
sotte
et
stupide
qui
serait
faite
des
éléments
les
plus
précieux
ce
pas
être
philosophe
que
de
rougir
avec
pline
de
la
misère
de
notre
origine
ce
qui
parait
vil
est
ici
la
chose
la
plus
précieuse
et
pour
laquelle
la
nature
semble
avoir
mis
le
plus
et
le
plus
mais
comme
quand
même
il
viendrait
source
encore
plus
vile
en
apparence
serait
pas
moins
le
plus
parfait
de
tous
les
êtres
quelle
que
soit
de
son
âme
si
elle
est
pure
noble
sublime
une
belle
âme
qui
rend
respectable
quiconque
en
est
doué
la
seconde
manière
de
raisonner
de
pluche
me
parait
vicieuse
même
dans
son
système
qui
tient
un
peu
du
fanatisme
car
si
nous
avons
une
idée
de
la
foi
qui
soit
contraire
aux
principes
les
plus
clairs
aux
vérités
les
plus
incontestables
il
faut
croire
pour
de
la
révélation
et
de
son
auteur
que
cette
idée
est
fausse
et
que
nous
ne
connaissons
point
encore
les
sens
des
paroles
de
de
deux
choses
ou
tout
est
illusion
tant
la
nature
même
que
la
révélation
ou
seule
peut
rendre
raison
de
la
foi
mais
quel
plus
grand
ridicule
que
celui
de
notre
auteur
je
entendre
un
péripatéticien
qui
dirait
il
ne
faut
pas
croire
de
toricelli
car
si
nous
la
croyions
si
nous
allions
bannir
du
vide
quelle
étonnante
philosophie
fait
voir
combien
le
raisonnement
de
pluche
est
vicieux
afin
de
prouver
premièrement
que
y
a
une
révélation
elle
point
suffisamment
démontrée
par
la
seule
autorité
de
et
sans
aucun
examen
de
la
raison
comme
le
prétendent
tous
ceux
qui
la
craignent
secondement
pour
mettre
à
de
toute
attaque
la
méthode
de
ceux
qui
voudraient
suivre
la
voie
que
je
leur
ouvre
les
choses
surnaturelles
incompréhensibles
en
soi
par
les
lumières
que
chacun
a
reçues
de
la
nature
et
doivent
donc
seules
nous
guider
ici
elles
se
trouvent
sans
nombre
dans
les
fastes
des
médecins
qui
ont
été
philosophes
et
non
dans
les
philosophes
qui
pas
été
médecins
ont
parcouru
ont
éclairé
le
labyrinthe
de
ils
nous
ont
seuls
dévoilé
ces
ressorts
cachés
sous
des
enveloppes
qui
dérobent
à
nos
yeux
tant
de
merveilles
eux
seuls
contemplant
tranquillement
notre
âme
mille
fois
surprise
et
dans
sa
misère
et
dans
sa
grandeur
sans
plus
la
mépriser
dans
de
ces
états
que
dans
encore
une
fois
voilà
les
seuls
physiciens
qui
aient
droit
de
parler
ici
que
nous
diraient
les
autres
et
surtout
les
théologiens
pas
ridicule
de
les
entendre
décider
sans
pudeur
sur
un
sujet
point
été
à
portée
de
connaître
dont
ils
ont
été
au
contraire
entièrement
détournés
par
des
études
obscures
qui
les
ont
conduits
à
mille
préjugés
et
pour
tout
dire
en
un
mot
au
fanatisme
qui
ajoute
encore
à
leur
ignorance
dans
le
mécanisme
des
corps
mais
quoique
nous
ayons
choisi
les
meilleurs
guides
nous
trouverons
encore
beaucoup
et
dans
cette
carrière
est
une
machine
si
composée
est
impossible
de
faire
une
idée
claire
et
conséquemment
de
la
définir
pourquoi
toutes
les
recherches
que
les
plus
grands
philosophes
ont
faites
à
priori
à
dire
en
voulant
se
servir
en
quelque
sorte
des
ailes
de
ont
été
vaines
ainsi
ce
posteriori
ou
en
cherchant
à
demêler
comme
au
travers
les
organes
du
corps
peut
je
ne
dis
pas
découvrir
avec
évidence
la
nature
même
de
mais
atteindre
le
plus
grand
degré
de
probabilité
possible
sur
ce
sujet
prenons
donc
le
bâton
de
et
laissons
là
de
toutes
les
vaines
opinions
des
philosophes
etre
aveugle
et
croire
pouvoir
se
passer
de
ce
bâton
le
comble
de
moderne
a
bien
raison
de
dire
a
que
la
vanité
seule
qui
ne
tire
pas
des
causes
secondes
le
même
parti
que
des
premières
on
peut
et
on
doit
même
admirer
tous
ces
beaux
génies
dans
leurs
travaux
les
plus
inutiles
les
descartes
les
malebranche
les
leibnitz
les
wolf
etc
mais
quel
fruit
je
vous
prie
retiré
de
leurs
profondes
méditations
et
de
tous
leurs
ouvrages
commençons
donc
et
voyons
non
ce
a
pensé
mais
ce
faut
penser
pour
le
repos
de
la
vie
autant
de
tempéraments
autant
de
caractères
et
de
moeurs
différentes
galien
même
a
connu
cette
vérité
que
descartes
et
non
hippocrate
comme
le
dit
de
de
a
poussée
loin
dire
que
la
médecine
seule
pouvait
changer
les
esprits
et
les
moeurs
avec
le
corps
il
est
vrai
la
mélancolie
la
bile
le
phlegme
le
sang
suivant
la
nature
et
la
diverse
combinaison
de
ces
humeurs
de
chaque
homme
font
un
homme
différent
dans
les
maladies
tantôt
et
ne
montre
aucun
signe
tantôt
on
dirait
est
double
tant
la
fureur
la
transporte
tantôt
se
dissipe
et
la
convalescence
sot
fait
un
homme
tantôt
le
plus
beau
génie
devenu
stupide
ne
se
reconnait
plus
adieu
toutes
ces
belles
connaissances
acquises
à
si
grands
frais
et
avec
tant
de
peine
ici
un
paralytique
qui
demande
si
sa
jambe
est
dans
son
lit
là
un
soldat
qui
croit
avoir
le
bras
lui
a
coupé
la
mémoire
de
ses
anciennes
sensations
et
du
lieu
où
son
âme
les
rapportait
fait
son
illusion
et
son
espèce
de
délire
il
suffit
de
lui
parler
de
cette
partie
qui
lui
manque
pour
lui
en
rappeller
et
faire
sentir
tous
les
mouvements
ce
qui
se
fait
avec
je
ne
sais
quel
déplaisir
ne
peut
exprimer
pleure
comme
un
enfant
aux
approches
de
la
mort
que
badine
que
à
caius
julius
à
sénèque
à
pétrone
pour
changer
leur
intrépidité
en
pusillanimité
ou
en
poltronnerie
une
obstruction
dans
la
rate
dans
le
foie
un
embarras
dans
la
veine
porte
pourquoi
parceque
se
bouche
avec
les
viscères
et
de
là
naissent
tous
ces
singuliers
phénomènes
de
hystérique
et
hypocondriaque
que
de
nouveau
sur
ceux
qui
être
transformés
en
en
coqs
en
vampires
qui
croient
que
les
morts
les
sucent
pourquoi
à
ceux
qui
voient
leur
nez
ou
autres
membres
de
verre
et
à
qui
il
faut
conseiller
de
coucher
sur
la
paille
de
peur
ne
se
cassent
afin
en
retrouvent
et
la
véritable
chair
lorsque
mettant
le
feu
à
la
paille
on
leur
fait
craindre
brûlés
frayeur
qui
a
quelquefois
guéri
la
paralysie
je
dois
légèrement
passer
sur
des
choses
connues
de
tout
le
monde
je
ne
serai
pas
plus
long
sur
le
détail
des
effets
du
sommeil
voyez
ce
soldat
fatigué
il
ronfle
dans
la
tranchée
au
bruit
de
cent
pièces
de
canons
son
âme
rien
son
sommeil
est
une
parfaite
apoplexie
une
bombe
va
il
sentira
moins
ce
coup
insecte
qui
se
trouve
sous
le
pied
autre
côté
cet
homme
que
la
jalousie
la
haine
ou
dévore
ne
peut
trouver
aucun
repos
le
lieu
le
plus
tranquille
les
boissons
les
plus
fraîches
et
les
plus
calmantes
tout
est
inutile
à
qui
pas
délivré
son
coeur
du
tourment
des
passions
et
le
corps
ensemble
a
mesure
que
le
mouvement
du
sang
se
calme
un
doux
sentiment
de
paix
et
de
tranquillité
se
répand
dans
toute
la
machine
se
sent
mollement
avec
les
paupières
et
avec
les
fibres
du
cerveau
elle
devient
ainsi
peu
à
peu
comme
paralytique
avec
tous
les
muscles
du
corps
ne
peuvent
plus
porter
le
poids
de
la
tête
celle
là
ne
peut
plus
soutenir
le
fardeau
de
la
pensée
elle
est
dans
le
sommeil
comme
point
la
circulation
se
avec
trop
de
vitesse
ne
peut
dormir
trop
agitée
le
sang
ne
peut
se
calmer
il
galope
dans
les
veines
avec
un
bruit
entend
telles
sont
les
deux
causes
réciproques
de
une
seule
frayeur
dans
les
songes
fait
battre
le
coeur
à
coups
redoublés
et
nous
arrache
à
la
nécessité
ou
à
la
douceur
du
repos
comme
feraient
une
vive
douleur
ou
des
besoins
urgents
enfin
comme
la
seule
cessation
des
fonctions
de
procure
le
sommeil
il
est
même
pendant
la
veille
qui
alors
des
sortes
de
petits
sommeils
très
fréquents
des
rêves
à
la
suisse
qui
prouvent
que
pas
toujours
le
corps
pour
dormir
car
si
elle
ne
dort
pas
combien
peu
lui
est
impossible
un
seul
objet
auquel
elle
ait
prêté
quelque
attention
parmi
cette
foule
innombrable
confuses
qui
comme
autant
de
nuages
remplissent
pour
ainsi
dire
de
notre
cerveau
a
trop
de
rapport
avec
le
sommeil
procure
pour
ne
pas
le
placer
ici
ce
remède
enivre
ainsi
que
le
vin
le
café
et
chacun
à
sa
manière
et
suivant
sa
dose
il
rend
heureux
dans
un
état
qui
semblerait
devoir
être
le
tombeau
du
sentiment
comme
il
est
de
la
mort
quelle
douce
léthargie
voudrait
jamais
sortir
elle
était
en
proie
aux
plus
grandes
douleurs
elle
ne
sent
plus
que
le
seul
plaisir
de
ne
plus
suffrir
et
de
jouir
de
la
plus
charmante
tranquillité
change
la
volonté
il
force
qui
voulait
veiller
et
se
divertir
se
mettre
au
lit
malgré
elle
je
passe
sous
silence
des
poisons
en
fouettant
que
le
café
cet
antidote
du
vin
dissipe
nos
maux
de
tête
et
nos
chagrins
sans
nous
en
ménager
comme
cette
liqueur
pour
le
lendemain
contemplons
dans
ses
autres
besoins
le
corps
humain

une
machine

ses
ressorts

dans
des
convives

férocité

vient
en

de

que
peut
seule
rendre
impuissantes
cette
férocité
produit
dans
la
haine
le
mépris
des
autres
nations

qui
dépravent

le

indulgent
des
juges

malheur
au
misérable

se
trouvait
sur

avait
fait
un
grand

il
était
homme
à

pendre
comme
le
coupable
nous
pensons
et
même
nous
ne
sommes
honnêtes
gens
que
comme
nous
sommes
gais
ou
braves
tout
dépend
de
la
manière
dont
notre

affreux

étouffe

ne

ne

que
des

dans
son

le

nous
offre
un
mémorable
exemple
de
la

de
le

voilà
un

lorsque
sa

fut
justifiée

malgré

ce
que
je

prouve
que

encore

un

un

que

sont
donc
toujours
corrélatifs
à
ceux
du

mais
pour
mieux
démontrer
toute
cette
dépendance
et
ses
causes
ici
de
comparée
ouvrons
les
entrailles
de
et
des
animaux
le
moyen
de
connaître
la
nature
humaine
si
éclairé
par
un
juste
parallèle
de
la
structure
des
uns
et
des
autres
en
général
la
forme
et
la
composition
du
cerveau
des
quadrupèdes
est
à
peu
près
la
même
que
dans
même
figure
même
disposition
partout
avec
cette
différence
essentielle
que
est
de
tous
les
animaux
celui
qui
a
le
plus
de
cerveau
et
le
cerveau
le
plus
tortueux
en
raison
de
la
masse
de
son
corps
ensuite
le
singe
le
castor
le
chien
le
renard
le
chat
voilà
les
animaux
qui
ressemblent
le
plus
à
car
on
remarque
aussi
chez
eux
la
même
analogie
graduée
par
rapport
au
corps
calleux
dans
lequel
lancisi
avait
établi
le
siège
de
avant
feu
de
la
peyronnie
qui
cependant
a
illustré
cette
opinion
par
une
foule
après
tous
les
quadrupèdes
ce
sont
les
oiseaux
qui
ont
le
plus
de
cerveau
les
poissons
ont
la
tête
grosse
mais
elle
est
vide
de
sens
comme
celle
de
bien
des
hommes
ils
point
de
corps
calleux
et
fort
peu
de
cerveau
lequel
manque
aux
insectes
je
ne
me
répandrai
point
en
un
plus
long
détail
des
variétés
de
la
nature
ni
en
conjectures
car
les
unes
et
les
autres
sont
infinies
comme
on
en
peut
juger
en
lisant
les
seuls
traités
de
willis
de
cerebro
et
de
anima
brutorum
je
conclûrai
seulement
ce
qui
suit
clairement
de
ces
incontestables
observations
que
plus
les
animaux
sont
farouches
moins
ils
ont
de
cerveau
que
ce
viscère
semble
en
quelque
sorte
à
proportion
de
leur
docilité
y
a
ici
une
singulière
condition
imposée
éternellement
par
la
nature
qui
est
que
plus
on
gagnera
du
côté
de
plus
on
perdra
du
côté
de
lequel
de
la
perte
ou
du
gain
ne
croyez
pas
au
reste
que
je
veuille
prétendre
par
là
que
le
seul
volume
du
cerveau
suffise
pour
faire
juger
du
degré
de
docilité
des
animaux
il
faut
que
la
qualité
réponde
encore
à
la
quantité
et
que
les
solides
et
les
fluides
soient
dans
cet
équilibre
convenable
qui
fait
la
santé
si
ne
manque
pas
de
cerveau
comme
on
le
remarque
ordinairement
ce
viscère
péchera
par
une
mauvaise
consistance
par
trop
de
mollesse
par
exemple
il
en
est
de
même
des
fous
les
vices
de
leur
cerveau
ne
se
dérobent
pas
toujours
à
nos
recherches
mais
si
les
causes
de
de
la
folie
etc
ne
sont
pas
sensibles
où
aller
chercher
celles
de
la
variété
de
tous
les
esprits
elles
échapperaient
aux
yeux
des
lynx
et
des
argus
un
rien
une
petite
fibre
quelque
chose
que
la
plus
subtile
anatomie
ne
peut
découvrir
eut
fait
deux
sots
et
de
fontenelle
qui
le
remarque
lui
même
dans
un
de
ses
meilleurs
dialogues
outre
la
mollesse
de
la
moëlle
du
cerveau
dans
les
enfants
dans
les
petits
chiens
et
dans
les
oiseaux
willis
a
remarqué
que
les
corps
cannelés
sont
effacés
et
comme
décolorés
dans
tous
ces
animaux
et
que
leurs
stries
sont
aussi
imparfaitement
formées
que
dans
les
paralytiques
il
ajoute
ce
qui
est
vrai
que
a
la
protubérance
annulaire
fort
grosse
et
ensuite
toujours
diminutivement
par
dégrés
le
singe
et
les
autres
animaux
nommés
tandis
que
le
veau
le
boeuf
le
loup
la
brebis
le
cochon
etc
qui
ont
cette
partie
très
petit
volume
ont
les
nattes
et
testes
fort
gros
on
a
beau
être
discret
et
réservé
sur
les
conséquences
peut
tirer
de
ces
observations
et
de
tant
sur
des
vaisseaux
et
des
nerfs
etc
tant
de
variétés
ne
peuvent
être
des
jeux
gratuits
de
la
nature
elles
prouvent
du
moins
la
nécessité
bonne
et
abondante
organisation
puisque
dans
tout
le
règne
animal
se
raffermissant
avec
le
corps
acquiert
de
la
sagacité
à
mesure
prend
des
forces
à
contempler
la
différente
docilité
des
animaux
sans
doute
la
mieux
entendue
conduit
à
croire
que
les
causes
dont
nous
avons
fait
mention
produisent
toute
la
diversité
qui
se
trouve
et
nous
faille
avouer
que
notre
faible
entendement
borné
aux
observations
les
plus
grossières
ne
puisse
voir
les
liens
qui
règnent
entre
la
cause
et
les
effets
une
espèce
que
les
philosophes
ne
connaîtront
jamais
parmi
les
animaux
les
uns
apprennent
à
parler
et
à
chanter
ils
retiennent
des
airs
et
prennent
tous
les
tons
aussi
exactement
musicien
les
autres
qui
montrent
cependant
plus
tels
que
le
singe
peuvent
venir
à
bout
pourquoi
cela
si
ce
par
un
vice
des
organes
de
la
parole
mais
ce
vice
tellement
de
conformation
puisse
apporter
aucun
remède
en
un
mot
absolument
impossible
une
langue
à
cet
animal
je
ne
le
crois
pas
je
prendrais
le
grand
singe
préférablement
à
tout
autre
ce
que
le
hasard
nous
eût
fait
découvrir
quelque
autre
espèce
plus
semblable
à
la
nôtre
car
rien
ne
répugne
y
en
ait
dans
des
régions
qui
nous
sont
inconnues
cet
animal
nous
ressemble
si
fort
que
les
naturalistes
appelé
homme
sauvage
ou
homme
des
bois
je
le
prendrais
aux
mêmes
conditions
des
écoliers
que
je
voudrais
ne
fût
ni
trop
jeune
ni
trop
vieux
car
ceux
nous
apporte
en
europe
sont
communément
trop
âgés
je
choisirais
celui
qui
aurait
la
physionomie
la
plus
spirituelle
et
qui
tiendrait
le
mieux
dans
mille
petites
opérations
ce
promis
enfin
ne
me
trouvant
pas
digne
son
gouverneur
je
le
mettrais
à
de
maître
que
je
viens
de
nommer
ou
autre
aussi
habile
en
est
vous
savez
par
le
livre
et
par
tous
ceux
qui
ont
traduit
sa
méthode
tous
les
prodiges
a
su
opérer
sur
les
sourds
de
naissance
dans
les
yeux
desquels
il
a
comme
il
le
fait
entendre
trouvé
des
oreilles
et
en
combien
peu
de
temps
enfin
il
leur
a
appris
à
entendre
parler
lire
et
écrire
je
veux
que
les
yeux
sourd
voient
plus
clair
et
soient
plus
intelligents
que
ne
pas
par
la
raison
que
la
perte
membre
ou
sens
peut
augmenter
la
force
ou
la
pénétration
autre
mais
le
singe
voit
et
entend
il
comprend
ce
entend
et
ce
voit
il
conçoit
si
parfaitement
les
signes
lui
fait
tout
autre
jeu
ou
tout
autre
exercice
je
ne
doute
point
ne
sur
les
disciples
pourquoi
donc
des
singes
impossible
pourquoi
ne
enfin
à
force
de
soins
imiter
à
des
sourds
les
mouvemens
nécessaires
pour
prononcer
je
décider
si
les
organes
de
la
parole
du
singe
ne
peuvent
fasse
rien
articuler
mais
cette
impossibilité
absolue
me
surprendrait
à
cause
de
la
grande
analogie
du
singe
et
de
et
point
connu
présent
dont
le
dedans
et
le
dehors
lui
ressemblent
manière
si
frappante
locke
qui
certainement
jamais
été
suspect
de
crédulité
pas
fait
difficulté
de
croire
que
le
chevalier
temple
fait
dans
ses
mémoires
perroquet
qui
répondait
à
propos
et
avait
appris
comme
nous
à
avoir
une
espèce
de
conversation
suivie
je
sais
moqué
de
ce
grand
métaphysicien
mais
qui
aurait
annoncé
à
y
a
des
générations
qui
se
font
sans
oeufs
et
sans
femmes
trouvé
beaucoup
de
partisans
cependant
trembley
en
a
découvert
qui
se
font
sans
accouplement
et
par
la
seule
section
amman
pas
aussi
passé
pour
un
fou
se
fût
vanté
avant
que
faire
expérience
et
en
aussi
peu
de
temps
des
écoliers
tels
que
les
siens
cependant
ses
succès
ont
étonné
et
comme
de
des
polypes
il
a
passé
de
plein
vol
à
qui
doit
à
son
génie
les
miracles
opère
à
mon
gré
sur
qui
doit
les
siens
au
hasard
qui
a
trouvé
le
plus
beau
des
règnes
et
de
lui
donner
des
perfections
pas
doit
être
mis
faiseur
oisif
de
systèmes
frivoles
ou
auteur
laborieux
de
stériles
découvertes
celles
sont
bien
autre
prix
il
a
tiré
les
hommes
de
auquel
ils
semblaient
condamnés
il
leur
a
donné
les
idées
de
une
âme
en
un
mot
jamais
eue
quel
plus
grand
pouvoir
ne
bornons
point
les
ressources
de
la
nature
elles
sont
infinies
surtout
aidées
grand
art
la
même
mécanique
qui
ouvre
le
canal
dans
les
sourds
ne
le
déboucher
dans
les
singes
une
heureuse
envie
la
prononciation
du
maître
ne
mettre
en
liberté
les
organes
de
la
parole
dans
les
animaux
qui
imitent
tant
signes
avec
tant
et
non
seulement
je
défie
me
cite
aucune
expérience
vraiment
concluante
qui
décide
mon
projet
impossible
et
ridicule
mais
la
similitude
de
la
structure
et
des
opérations
du
singe
est
telle
que
je
ne
doute
presque
point
si
on
exerçait
parfaitement
cet
animal
ne
vînt
enfin
à
bout
de
lui
apprendre
à
prononcer
et
par
conséquent
à
savoir
une
langue
alors
ce
ne
serait
plus
ni
un
homme
sauvage
ni
un
homme
manqué
ce
serait
un
homme
parfait
un
petit
homme
de
ville
avec
autant
ou
de
muscles
que
pour
penser
et
profiter
de
son
éducation
des
animaux
à
la
transition
pas
violente
les
vrais
philosophes
en
conviendront
avant
des
mots
et
la
connaissance
des
langues
un
animal
de
son
espèce
qui
avec
beaucoup
moins
naturel
que
les
autres
dont
alors
il
ne
se
croyait
pas
roi
distingué
du
singe
et
des
autres
animaux
que
comme
le
singe
je
veux
dire
par
une
physionomie
qui
annonçait
plus
de
discernement
réduit
à
la
seule
connaissance
intuitive
des
leibniziens
il
ne
voyait
que
des
figures
et
des
couleurs
sans
pouvoir
rien
distinguer
vieux
comme
jeune
enfant
à
tout
âge
il
bégayait
ses
sensations
et
ses
besoins
comme
un
chien
affamé
ou
ennuyé
de
repos
demande
à
manger
ou
à
se
promener
les
mots
les
langues
les
lois
les
sciences
les
sont
venus
et
par
eux
enfin
le
diamant
brut
de
notre
esprit
a
été
poli
on
a
dressé
un
homme
comme
un
animal
on
est
devenu
auteur
comme
portefaix
un
géomètre
a
appris
à
faire
les
démonstrations
et
les
calculs
les
plus
difficiles
comme
un
singe
à
ôter
ou
mettre
son
petit
chapeau
et
à
monter
sur
son
chien
docile
tout
fait
par
les
signes
chaque
espèce
a
compris
ce
a
pu
comprendre
et
de
cette
manière
que
les
hommes
ont
acquis
la
connaissance
symbolique
ainsi
nommée
encore
par
nos
philosophes
rien
de
si
simple
comme
on
voit
que
la
mécanique
de
notre
éducation
tout
se
réduit
à
des
sons
ou
à
des
mots
qui
de
la
bouche
de
passent
par
de
dans
le
cerveau
qui
reçoit
en
même
temps
par
les
yeux
la
figure
des
corps
dont
ces
mots
sont
les
signes
arbitraires
mais
qui
a
parlé
le
premier
qui
a
été
le
premier
précepteur
du
genre
human
qui
a
inventé
les
moyens
de
mettre
à
profit
la
docilité
de
notre
organisation
je
sais
rien
le
nom
de
ces
heureux
et
premiers
génies
a
été
perdu
dans
la
nuit
des
temps
mais
est
le
fils
de
la
nature
elle
a
dû
longtemps
le
précéder
on
doit
croire
que
les
hommes
les
mieux
organisés
ceux
pour
qui
la
nature
aura
épuisé
ses
bienfaits
auront
instruit
les
autres
ils
pu
entendre
un
bruit
nouveau
par
exemple
éprouver
de
nouvelles
sensations
être
frappé
de
tous
ces
beaux
objets
divers
qui
forment
le
ravissant
spectacle
de
la
nature
sans
se
trouver
dans
le
cas
de
ce
sourd
de
chartres
dont
le
grand
fontenelle
nous
a
le
premier
donné
entendit
pour
la
première
fois
à
quarante
ans
le
bruit
étonnant
des
cloches
de
là
absurde
de
croire
que
ces
premiers
mortels
essayèrent
à
la
manière
de
ce
sourd
ou
à
celle
des
animaux
et
des
muets
autre
espèce
leurs
nouveaux
sentiments
par
des
mouvements
dépendants
de
de
leur
imagination
et
conséquemment
ensuite
par
des
sons
spontanés
propres
à
chaque
animal
expression
naturelle
de
leur
surprise
de
leur
joie
de
leurs
transports
ou
de
leurs
besoins
car
sans
doute
ceux
que
la
nature
a
doués
sentiment
plus
exquis
ont
eu
aussi
plus
de
facilité
pour
voilà
comme
je
conçois
que
les
hommes
ont
employé
leur
sentiment
ou
leur
instinct
pour
avoir
de
et
enfin
leur
esprit
pour
avoir
des
connaissances
voilà
par
quels
moyens
autant
que
je
puis
les
saisir
on
rempli
le
cerveau
des
idées
pour
le
réception
desquelles
la
nature
formé
on
aidé
par
et
les
plus
petits
commencements
peu
à
peu
toutes
les
choses
de
ont
été
aussi
facilement
distinguées
cercle
comme
une
corde
de
violon
ou
une
touche
de
clavecin
frémit
et
rend
un
son
les
cordes
du
cerveau
frappées
par
les
rayons
sonores
ont
été
excitées
à
rendre
ou
à
redire
les
mots
qui
les
touchaient
mais
comme
telle
est
la
construction
de
ce
viscère
que
dès
fois
les
yeux
bien
formés
pour
ont
reçu
la
peinture
des
objets
le
cerveau
ne
peut
pas
ne
pas
voir
leurs
images
et
leurs
différences
de
même
lorsque
les
signes
de
ces
différences
ont
été
marqués
ou
gravés
dans
le
cerveau
en
a
nécessairement
examiné
les
rapports
examen
qui
lui
était
impossible
sans
la
découverte
des
signes
ou
des
langues
dans
ces
temps
où
était
presque
muet
était
à
de
tous
les
objets
comme
un
homme
qui
sans
avoir
aucune
idée
des
proportions
regarderait
un
tableau
ou
une
pièce
de
sculpture
il
pourrait
rien
distinguer
ou
comme
un
petit
enfant
car
alors
était
dans
son
enfance
qui
tenant
dans
sa
main
un
certain
nombre
de
petits
brins
de
paille
ou
de
bois
les
voit
en
général
vue
vague
et
superficielle
sans
pouvoir
les
compter
ni
les
distinguer
mais
mette
une
espèce
de
pavillon
ou
à
cette
pièce
de
bois
par
exemple
appelle
mât
en
mette
un
autre
à
un
autre
pareil
corps
que
le
premier
venu
se
nombre
par
le
signe
et
le
second
par
le
signe
ou
chiffre
alors
cet
enfant
pourra
les
compter
et
ainsi
de
suite
il
apprendra
toute
dès
figure
lui
paraîtra
égale
à
une
autre
par
son
signe
numératif
il
conclûra
sans
peine
que
ce
sont
deux
corps
différents
que
et
font
deux
que
et
font
etc
cette
similitude
réelle
ou
apparente
des
figures
qui
est
la
base
fondamentale
de
toutes
les
vérités
et
de
toutes
nos
connaissances
parmi
lesquelles
il
est
évident
que
celles
dont
les
signes
sont
moins
simples
et
moins
sensibles
sont
plus
difficiles
à
apprendre
que
les
autres
en
ce
demandent
plus
de
génie
pour
embrasser
et
combiner
cette
immense
quantité
de
mots
par
lesquels
les
sciences
dont
je
parle
expriment
les
vérités
de
leur
ressort
tandis
que
les
sciences
qui
par
des
chiffres
ou
autres
petits
signes
facilement
et
sans
doute
cette
facilité
qui
a
fait
la
fortune
des
calculs
algébriques
plus
encore
que
leur
évidence
tout
ce
savoir
dont
le
vent
enfle
le
ballon
du
cerveau
de
nos
pédants
orgueilleux
donc
vaste
amas
de
mots
et
de
figures
qui
forment
dans
la
tête
toutes
les
traces
par
lesquelles
nous
distinguons
et
nous
nous
rappellons
les

toutes
nos
idées
se
réveillent
comme
un
jardinier
qui
connaît
les
plantes
se
souvient
de
toutes
leurs
phases
à
leur
aspect
ces
mots
et
ces
figures
qui
sont
désignés
par
eux

tellements
liés

assez
rare
imagine
une
chose
sans
le
nom
ou
le
signe
qui
lui
est
attaché
je
me
sers
toujours
du
mot

parceque
je
crois
que
tout
et
que
toutes
les
parties
de
peuvent
être
justement
réduites
à
la
seule
imagination
qui
les
forme
toutes
et
le
jugement
le
raisonnement
la
mémoire
ne
sont
que
des
parties
de
nullement
absolues
mais
de
véritables
modifications
de
cette
espèce
de
toile
médullaire
sur
laquelle
les
objets
peints
dans
sont
renvoyés
comme
lanterne
magique
mais
si
tel
est
ce
merveilleux
et
incompréhensible
résultat
de
du
cerveau
si
tout
se
conçoit
par
si
tout
par
elle
pourquoi
diviser
le
principe
sensitif
qui
pense
dans
pas
une
contradiction
manifeste
dans
les
partisans
de
la
simplicité
de
car
une
chose
divise
ne
peut

être
sans
absurdité
regardée
comme
indivisible
voilà
où
conduit
des
langues
et
de
ces
grands
mots
spiritualité
immatérialité
placés
à
tout
hasard
sans
être
entendus
même
par
des
gens
rien
de
plus
facile
que
de
prouver
un
système
fondé
comme
sur
le
sentiment
intime
et
propre
de
chaque
individu
ou
cette
partie
fantastique
du
cerveau
dont
la
nature
nous
est
aussi
inconnue
que
sa
manière
naturellement
petite

faible
elle
aura
à
peine
la
force
de

la
ressemblance
de
ses
idées
elle
ne
pourra
voir
que
ce
qui
sera
ou
ce
qui
le
plus
vivement
et
encore
de
quelle
manière

toujours
vrai
que
seule
aperçoit
que

ceux
que
la

a
comblés
de
ses
dons
les
plus
précieux
doivent
plaindre
ceux
à
qui
ils
ont
été
refusés
mais
ils
peuvent
sentir
leur
supériorité
sans
orgueil
et
en
connaisseurs
une

aussi
ridicule
de

de

une

construit
sans

le
serait
en
pure
perte
comme
sans

le
mieux

grossier
mais
aussi
quel
serait
le
fruit
de
la
plus
excellente
école
sans
une
matrice
parfaitement
ouverte
à
ou
à
la
conception
des
idées
il
est
aussi
impossible
de
donner
une
seule
idée
à
un
homme
privé
de
tous
les
sens
que
de
faire
un
enfant
à
une
femme
à
laquelle
la
nature
aurait
poussé
la
distraction
oublier
de
faire
une
vulve
comme
je
vu
dans
une
qui
ni
fente
ni
vagin
ni
matrice
et
qui
pour
cette
raison
fut
démariée
après
dix
ans
de
mariage
mais
si
le
cerveau
est
à
la
fois
bien
organisé
et
bien
instruit
une
terre
féconde
parfaitement
ensemencée
qui
produit
le
centuple
de
ce
a
reçu
ou
pour
quitter
le
style
figuré
souvent
nécessaire
pour
mieux
exprimer
ce
sent
et
donner
des
grâces
à
la

même
élevée
par
à
la
belle
et
rare
dignité
de
génie
saisit
exactement
tous
les
rapports
des
idées

conçues
embrasse
avec
facilité
une
foule
étonnante
pour
en
tirer
enfin
une
longue
chaîne
de
conséquences
lesquelles
ne
sont
encore
que
de
nouveaux
rapports
enfantés
par
la
comparaison
des
premiers
auxquels
trouve
une
parfaite
ressemblance
telle
est
selon
moi
la
génération
de
je
dis
trouve
comme
donné
à
la
similitude
des
objets
non
que
je
pense
que
nos
sens
soient
toujours
trompeurs
comme
prétendu
le
père
malebranche
ou
que
nos
yeux
naturellement
un
peu
ivres
ne
voient
pas
les
objets
tels
sont
en
eux
mêmes
quoique
les
microscopes
nous
le
prouvent
tous
les
jours
mais
pour
aucune
dispute
avec
les
pyrrhoniens
parmi
lesquels
bayle
distingué
je
dis
de
la
vérité
en
général
ce
que
de
fontenelle
dit
de
certaines
en
particulier
faut
la
sacrifier
aux
agréments
de
la
société
il
est
de
la
douceur
de
mon
caractère
à
toute
dispute
ne
pas
la
conversation
les
cartésiens
viendraient
ici
vainement
à
la
charge
avec
leur
idées
innées
je
ne
me
donnerais
certainement
pas
le
quart
de
la
peine
prise
locke
pour
attaquer
de
telles
chimères
quelle
utilité
en
effet
de
faire
un
gros
livre
pour
prouver
une
doctrine
qui
était
érigée
en
axiome
il
y
a
trois
mille
ans
suivant
les
principes
que
nous
avons
posés
et
que
nous
croyons
vrais
celui
qui
a
le
plus
doit
être
regardé
comme
ayant
le
plus
ou
de
génie
car
tous
ces
mots
sont
synonymes
et
encore
une
fois
par
un
abus
honteux
croit
dire
des
choses
différentes
ne
dit
que
différents
mots
ou
différents
sons
auxquels
on
attaché
aucune
idée
ou
distinction
réelle
la
plus
belle
la
plus
grande
ou
la
plus
forte
imagination
est
donc
la
plus
propre
aux
sciences
comme
aux
arts
je
ne
décide
point
faut
plus
pour
exceller
dans
des
aristotes
ou
des
descartes
que
dans
celui
des
euripides
ou
des
sophocles
et
si
la
nature
mise
en
plus
grands
frais
pour
faire
newton
que
pour
former
corneille
ce
dont
je
doute
fort
mais
il
est
certain
que
la
seule
imagination
diversement
appliquée
qui
a
fait
leur
différent
triomphe
et
leur
gloire
immortelle
si
passe
pour
avoir
peu
de
jugement
avec
beaucoup
cela
veut
dire
que
trop
abandonnée
à
elle
même
presque
toujours
comme
occupée
à
se
regarder
dans
le
miroir
de
ses
sensations
pas
assez
contracté
de
les
examiner
avec
attention
plus
profondément
pénétrée
des
traces
ou
des
images
que
de
leur
vérité
ou
de
leur
ressemblance
il
est
vrai
que
telle
est
la
vivacité
des
ressorts
de
que
si
cette
clé
ou
mère
des
sciences
ne
mêle
il
ne
lui
est
guères
permis
que
de
parcourir
et
les
objets

cet
oiseau
sur
la
branche

toujours
prêt

de

emportée
par
le
tourbillon
du

des
esprits
une
onde

une
trace
effacée
par
celle
qui
suit
court
après
souvent
en
vain
il
faut
à
regretter
ce
pas
assez
vite
saisi
et
fixé
et
ainsi
que
véritable
image
du
temps
se
détruit
et
se
renouvelle
sans

tel
est
le
chaos
et
la
succession
continuelle
et
rapide
de
nos
idées
elles
se
chassent
comme
un
flot
pousse
de
sorte
que
si
pour
ainsi
dire
une
partie
de
ses
muscles
pour
être
comme
en
équilibre
sur
les
cordes
du
cerveau
pour
se
soutenir
quelque
temps
sur
un
objet
qui
va
fuir
et
de
tomber
sur
un

de
contempler
jamais
elle
ne

elle

des

des

jamais
un
seul

au
contraire
si
dès
on
accoutume
à
se
brider
à
ne
point
se
laisser
emporter
à
sa
propre
impétuosité
qui
ne
fait
que
de
brillants
enthousiastes
à

pénétration
clairvoyante
sans
laquelle
on
fait
peu
de
progrès
dans

les
simples
fondements
sur
lesquels
a
été
bati
de
la
logique
la

avait
jetés

tout
le

de

mais
il

avec

tombera
il
se
noie
où
se
sauve
à
la
nage
a
quatorze
ou
quinze
ans
il
entrevoit
à
peine
les
grands
plaisirs
qui
dans
la
reproduction
de
son
espèce
déjà
adolescent
il
ne
sait
pas
trop
comment
prendre
dans
un
jeu
que
la
nature
apprend
si
vite
aux
animaux
il
se
cache
comme
était
honteux
du
plaisir
et
fait
pour
être
heureux
tandis
que
les
animaux
se
font
gloire
cyniques
sans
éducation
ils
sont
sans
préjugés
mais
voyons
encore
ce
chien
et
cet
enfant
qui
ont
tous
deux
perdu
leur
maître
dans
un
grand
chemin
pleure
il
ne
sait
à
quel
saint
se
vouer
le
chien
mieux
servi
par
son
odorat
que
par
sa
raison
bientôt
trouvé
la
nature
nous
avait
donc
faits
pour
être
au
dessous
des
animaux
ou
du
moins
pour
faire
par
là
même
mieux
éclater
les
prodiges
de
qui
seule
nous
tire
du
niveau
et
nous
élève
enfin
mais
la
même
distinction
aux
sourds
aux
aux
imbéciles
aux
fous
aux
hommes
sauvages
ou
qui
ont
été
élevés
dans
les
bois
avec
les
bêtes
à
ceux
dont
hypocondriaque
a
perdu
enfin
à
toutes
ces
bêtes
à
figure
humaine
qui
ne
montrent
que
le
plus
grossier
non
tous
ces
hommes
de
corps
et
non
ne
méritent
pas
une
classe
particulière
nous
pas
dessein
de
nous
dissimuler
les
objections
peut
faire
en
faveur
de
la
distinction
primitive
de
et
des
animaux
contre
notre
sentiment
il
y
a
dans
une
loi
naturelle
une
connaissance
du
bien
et
du
mal
qui
pas
été
gravée
dans
le
coeur
des
animaux
mais
cette
objection
ou
plutôt
cette
assertion
fondée
sur
sans
laquelle
un
philosophe
peut
tout
rejeter
en
qui
nous
convainque
que
seul
a
été
éclairé
rayon
refusé
à
tous
les
autres
animaux
en
a
point
nous
ne
pouvons
pas
plus
connaître
par
elle
ce
qui
se
passe
dans
eux
et
même
dans
les
hommes
que
ne
pas
sentir
ce
qui
affecte
de
notre
être
nous
savons
que
nous
pensons
et
que
nous
avons
des
remords
un
sentiment
intime
ne
nous
force
que
trop
convenir
mais
pour
juger
des
remords
ce
sentiment
qui
est
dans
nous
est
insuffisant
pourquoi
il
en
faut
croire
les
autres
hommes
sur
leur
parole
ou
sur
les
signes
sensibles
et
extérieurs
que
nous
avons
remarqués
en
lorsque
nous
éprouvions
la
même
conscience
et
les
mêmes
tourments
mais
pour
décider
si
les
animaux
qui
ne
parlent
point
ont
reçu
la
loi
naturelle
il
faut
rapporter
conséquemment
à
ces
signes
dont
je
viens
de
parler
supposé
existent
les
faits
semblent
le
prouver
le
chien
qui
a
mordu
son
maître
qui
a
paru
repentir
le
moment
suivant
on
vu
triste
fâché
se
montrer
et
coupable
par
un
air
rampant
et
humilié
nous
offre
un
exemple
célèbre
lion
qui
ne
voulut
pas
déchirer
un
homme
abandonné
à
sa
fureur
parce
le
reconnut
pour
son
bienfaiteur
serait
à
souhaiter
que
même
montrât
toujours
la
même
reconnaissance
pour
les
bienfaits
et
le
même
respect
pour
on
plus
à
craindre
les
ingrats
ni
ces
guerres
qui
sont
le
fléau
du
genre
humain
et
les
vrais
bourreaux
de
la
loi
naturelle
mais
un
être
à
qui
la
nature
a
donné
un
instinct
si
précoce
si
éclairé
qui
juge
combine
raisonne
et
délibère
autant
que
et
le
lui
permet
la
sphère
de
son
activité
un
être
qui
par
les
bienfaits
qui
se
détache
par
les
mauvais
traitements
et
va
essayer
un
meilleur
maître
un
être
structure
semblable
à
la
nôtre
qui
fait
les
mêmes
opérations
qui
a
les
mêmes
passions
les
mêmes
douleurs
les
mêmes
plaisirs
plus
ou
moins
vifs
suivant
de
et
la
délicatesse
des
nerfs
un
tel
être
enfin
ne
pas
clairement
sent
ses
torts
et
les
nôtres
connait
le
bien
et
le
mal
et
en
un
mot
a
conscience
de
ce
fait
son
âme
qui
marque
comme
la
nôtre
les
mêmes
joies
les
mêmes
mortifications
les
mêmes
déconcertements
sans
aucune
répugnance
à
la
vue
de
son
semblable
déchiré
ou
après
impitoyablement
mis
en
pièces
cela
posé
le
don
précieux
dont
il
point
été
refusé
aux
animaux
car
nous
offrent
des
signes
évidents
de
leur
repentir
comme
de
leur
intelligence
à
penser
que
des
êtres
des
machines
presque
aussi
parfaites
que
nous
soient
comme
nous
faites
pour
penser
et
pour
sentir
la
nature
ne
point
que
les
animaux
sont
pour
la
plupart
des
êtres
féroces
qui
ne
sont
pas
capables
de
sentir
les
maux
font
car
tous
les
hommes
mieux
les
vices
et
les
vertus
il
est
dans
notre
espèce
de
la
férocité
comme
dans
la
leur
les
hommes
qui
sont
dans
la
barbare
habitude
la
loi
naturelle
sont
pas
si
tourmentés
que
ceux
qui
la
transgressent
pour
la
première
fois
et
que
la
force
de
point
endurcis
il
en
est
de
même
des
animaux
comme
des
hommes
les
uns
et
les
autres
peuvent
être
plus
ou
moins
féroces
par
tempérament
et
ils
le
deviennent
encore
plus
avec
ceux
qui
le
sont
mais
un
animal
doux
pacifique
qui
vit
avec
animaux
semblables
et
doux
sera
ennemi
du
sang
et
du
carnage
il
rougira
intérieurement
de
versé
avec
cette
différence
que
comme
chez
eux
tout
est
immolé
aux
besoins
aux
plaisirs
et
aux
commodités
de
la
vie
dont
ils
jouissent
plus
que
nous
leurs
remords
ne
semblent
pas
devoir
être
si
vifs
que
les
nôtres
parceque
nous
ne
sommes
pas
dans
la
même
nécessité
la
coutume
émousse
et
étouffe
les
remords
comme
les
plaisirs
mais
je
veux
pour
un
moment
supposer
que
je
me
trompe
et
pas
juste
que
presque
tout
ait
tort
à
ce
sujet
tandis
que
seul
raison
que
les
animaux
même
les
plus
excellents
ne
connaissent
pas
la
distinction
du
bien
et
du
mal
moral
aucune
mémoire
des
attentions
a
eues
pour
eux
du
bien
leur
a
fait
aucun
sentiment
de
leurs
propres
vertus
que
ce
lion
par
exemple
dont
parlé
après
tant
ne
se
souvienne
pas
de
pas
voulu
ravir
la
vie
à
cet
homme
qui
fut
livré
à
sa
furie
dans
un
spectacle
plus
inhumain
que
tous
les
lions
les
tigres
et
les
ours
tandis
que
nos
compatriotes
se
battent
suisses
contre
suisses
frères
contre
frères
se
reconnaissent
ou
se
tuent
sans
remords
parce
prince
paie
leurs
meurtres
je
suppose
enfin
que
la
loi
naturelle
pas
été
donnée
aux
animaux
quelles
en
seront
les
conséquences
pas
pétri
limon
plus
précieux
la
nature
employé
seule
et
même
pâte
dont
elle
a
seulement
varié
les
levains
si
donc
ne
se
repent
pas
violé
le
sentiment
intérieur
dont
je
parle
ou
plutôt
en
est
absolument
privé
il
faut
nécessairement
que
soit
dans
le
même
cas
moyennant
quoi
adieu
la
loi
naturelle
et
tous
ces
beaux
traités
a
publiés
sur
elle
tout
le
règne
animal
en
serait
généralement
dépourvû
mais
réciproquement
si
ne
peut
se
dispenser
de
convenir
distingue
toujours
lorsque
la
santé
le
laisse
jouïr
de
ceux
qui
ont
de
la
probité
de
de
la
vertu
de
ceux
qui
ne
sont
ni
humains
ni
vertueux
ni
honnêtes
gens
est
facile
de
distinguer
ce
qui
est
vice
ou
vertu
par
plaisir
ou
la
propre
répugnance
qui
en
sont
comme
les
effets
naturels
il
que
les
animaux
formés
de
la
même
matière
à
laquelle
il
manqué
degré
de
fermentation
pour
égaler
les
hommes
en
tout
doivent
participer
aux
mêmes
prérogatives
de
et
il
point
ou
de
substance
sensitive
sans
remords
la
réflexion
suivante
va
fortifier
on
ne
peut
détruire
la
loi
naturelle
en
est
si
forte
dans
tous
les
animaux
que
je
ne
doute
nullement
que
les
plus
sauvages
et
les
plus
féroces
quelques
moments
de
repentir
je
crois
que
la
fille
sauvage
de
châlons
en
champagne
aura
porté
la
peine
de
son
crime
est
vrai
ait
mangé
sa
soeur
je
pense
la
même
chose
de
tous
ceux
qui
commettent
des
crimes
même
involontaires
ou
de
tempérament
de
gaston
qui
ne
pouvait
de
voler
de
certaine
femme
qui
fut
sujette
au
même
vice
dans
la
grossesse
et
dont
ses
enfants
héritèrent
de
celle
qui
dans
le
même
état
mangea
son
mari
de
cette
autre
qui
égorgeait
les
enfants
salait
leurs
corps
et
en
mangeait
tous
les
jours
comme
du
petit
salé
de
cette
fille
de
voleur
anthropophage
qui
la
devint
à
ans
perdu
père
et
mère
à
an
elle
eût
été
élevée
par
gens
pour
ne
rien
dire
de
tant
exemples
dont
nos
observateurs
sont
remplis
et
qui
prouvent
tous
est
mille
vices
et
vertus
héréditaires
qui
passent
des
parents
aux
enfants
comme
ceux
de
la
nourrice
à
ceux
allaite
je
dis
donc
et
que
ces
malheureux
ne
sentent
pas
pour
la
plupart
sur
le
champ
de
leur
action
la
boulimie
par
exemple
ou
la
faim
canine
peut
éteindre
tout
sentiment
une
manie
est
forcé
de
satisfaire
mais
revenues
à
et
comme
désenivrées
quels
remords
pour
ces
femmes
qui
se
rappellent
le
meurtre
ont
commis
dans
ce
avaient
de
plus
cher
quelle
punition
mal
involontaire
auquel
elles
pu
résister
dont
elles
eu
aucune
conscience
cependant
ce
point
assez
apparemment
pour
les
juges
parmi
les
femmes
dont
je
parle
fut
rouée
et
brûlée
enterrée
vive
je
sens
tout
ce
que
demande
de
la
société
mais
il
serait
sans
doute
à
souhaiter
eût
pour
juges
que
médecins
eux
seuls
pourraient
distinguer
le
criminel
innocent
du
coupable
si
la
raison
est
esclave
sens
dépravé
ou
en
fureur
comment
le
gouverner
mais
si
le
crime
porte
avec
soi
sa
propre
punition
plus
ou
moins
cruelle
si
la
plus
longue
et
la
plus
barbare
habitude
ne
peut
arracher
le
repentir
des
coeurs
les
plus
inhumains
sont
déchirés
par
la
mémoire
même
de
leurs
actions
pour
quoi
effrayer
des
esprits
faibles
par
un
enfer
par
des
spectres
et
des
précipices
de
feu
moins
réels
encore
que
ceux
de
pascal
besoin
de
recourir
à
des
fables
comme
un
pape
de
bonne
foi
dit
pour
tourmenter
les
malheureux
mêmes
fait
périr
parce
ne
les
trouve
pas
assez
punis
par
leur
propre
conscience
qui
est
leur
premier
bourreau
ce
pas
que
je
veuille
dire
que
tous
les
criminels
soient
injustement
punis
je
prétends
seulement
que
ceux
dont
la
volonté
est
dépravée
et
la
conscience
éteinte
le
sont
assez
par
leurs
remords
quand
ils
reviennent
à
remords
encore
le
dire
dont
la
nature
aurait
dû
en
ce
cas
ce
me
semble
délivrer
des
malheureux
entraînés
par
une
fatale
nécessité
les
criminels
les
méchants
les
ingrats
ceux
enfin
que
ne
sentent
pas
la
nature
tyrans
malheureux
et
indignes
du
jour
ont
beau
se
faire
un
cruel
plaisir
de
leur
barbarie
il
est
des
moments
calmes
et
de
réflexion
où
la
conscience
vengeresse
dépose
et
les
condamne
à
être
presque
sans
cesse
déchirés
de
ses
propres
mains
qui
tourmente
les
hommes
est
tourmenté
par
et
les
maux
sentira
seront
la
juste
mesure
de
ceux
aura
faits
autre
côté
il
y
a
tant
de
plaisir
à
faire
du
bien
à
sentir
à
reconnaître
celui
reçoit
tant
de
contentement
à
pratiquer
la
vertu
à
être
doux
humain
tendre
charitable
compatissant
et
généreux
ce
seul
mot
renferme
toutes
les
vertus
que
je
tiens
pour
assez
puni
quiconque
a
le
malheur
de
pas
né
vertueux
nous
pas
originairement
été
faits
pour
être
savants
par
une
espèce
de
nos
facultés
organiques
que
nous
le
sommes
devenus
et
cela
à
la
charge
de
qui
nourrit
une
multitude
de
fainéants
que
la
vanité
a
decorés
du
nom
de
philosophes
la
nature
nous
a
tous
créés
uniquement
pour
être
heureux
oui
tous
depuis
le
ver
qui
rampe
qui
se
perd
dans
la
nue
pourquoi
elle
a
donné
à
tous
les
animaux
quelque
portion
de
la
loi
naturelle
portion
plus
ou
moins
exquise
selon
que
le
comportent
les
organes
bien
conditionnés
de
chaque
animal
a
présent
comment
la
loi
naturelle
un
sentiment
qui
nous
apprend
ce
que
nous
ne
devons
pas
faire
parce
que
nous
ne
voudrions
pas
nous
le
fît
ajouter
à
cette
idée
commune
me
semble
que
ce
sentiment
espèce
de
crainte
ou
de
frayeur
aussi
salutaire
à
car
ne
la
bourse
et
la
vie
des
autres
que
pour
nous
conserver
nos
biens
notre
honneur
et
semblables
à
ces
ixions
du
christianisme
qui
dieu
et
tant
de
chimériques
vertus
que
parce
craignent
vous
voyez
que
la
loi
naturelle
sentiment
intime
qui
appartient
encore
à
comme
tous
les
autres
parmi
lesquels
on
compte
la
pensée
par
conséquent
elle
ne
suppose
évidemment
ni
éducation
ni
révélation
ni
législateur
à
moins
ne
veuille
la
confondre
avec
les
lois
civiles
à
la
manière
ridicule
des
théologiens
les
armes
du
fanatisme
peuvent
détruire
ceux
qui
soutiennent
ces
vérités
mais
elles
ne
détruiront
jamais
ces
vérités
mêmes
ce
pas
que
je
révoque
en
doute
etre
suprême
il
me
semble
au
contraire
que
le
plus
grand
degré
de
probabilité
est
pour
elle
mais
comme
cette
existence
ne
prouve
pas
plus
la
nécessité
culte
que
toute
autre
une
vérité
théorique
qui
guère
dans
la
pratique
de
sorte
que
comme
on
peut
dire
tant
que
la
religion
ne
suppose
pas
probité
les
mêmes
raisons
autorisent
à
penser
que
ne
pas
qui
sait
si
la
raison
de
de
ne
serait
pas
dans
son
existence
même
été
jeté
au
hasard
sur
un
point
de
la
surface
de
la
terre
sans
puisse
savoir
ni
comment
ni
pourquoi
mais
seulement
doit
vivre
et
mourir
semblable
à
ces
champignons
qui
paraissent
jour
à
ou
à
ces
fleurs
qui
bordent
les
fossés
et
couvrent
les
murailles
ne
nous
perdons
point
dans
nous
ne
sommes
pas
faits
pour
en
avoir
la
moindre
idée
il
nous
est
absolument
impossible
de
remonter
à
des
choses
il
est
égal
pour
notre
repos
que
la
matière
soit
éternelle
ou
ait
été
créée
y
ait
un
dieu
ou
en
ait
pas
quelle
folie
de
tant
se
tourmenter
pour
ce
est
impossible
de
connaître
et
ce
qui
ne
nous
rendrait
pas
plus
heureux
quand
nous
en
viendrions
à
bout
mais
lisez
tous
les
ouvrages
des
fénelon
des
nieuventit
des
abadie
des
derham
des
raï
etc
eh
bien
que
ou
plutôt
que
appris
ce
ne
sont
que
répétitions
zélés
dont
à
verbiage
plus
propres
à
fortifier
saper
les
fondements
de
le
volume
des
preuves
tire
du
spectacle
de
la
nature
ne
leur
donne
pas
plus
de
force
la
structure
seule
doigt
oreille
oeil
une
observation
de
malpighi
prouve
tout
et
sans
doute
beaucoup
mieux
que
descartes
et
malebranche
ou
tout
le
reste
ne
prouve
rien
les
déistes
et
les
chrétiens
mêmes
devraient
donc
se
contenter
de
faire
observer
que
dans
tout
le
règne
animal
les
mêmes
vues
sont
exécutées
par
une
infinité
de
divers
moyens
tous
cependant
exactement
géométriques
car
de
quelles
plus
fortes
armes
terrasser
les
athées
il
est
vrai
que
si
ma
raison
ne
me
trompe
pas
et
tout
semblent
avoir
été
destinés
à
cette
unité
de
vues
le
soleil
la
forme
des
corps
tout
est
arrangé
dans
comme
dans
un
miroir
qui
présente
fidèlement
à
les
objets
qui
y
sont
peints
suivant
les
lois
cette
infinie
variété
de
corps
qui
servent
à
la
vision
dans
nous
trouvons
partout
une
diversité
frappante
sans
que
cette
diverse
fabrique
de
des
animaux
des
oiseaux
des
poissons
produise
différents
usages
toutes
les
oreilles
sont
si
mathématiquement
faites
tendent
également
au
seul
et
même
but
qui
est
le
hasard
demande
le
déiste
donc
assez
grand
géomètre
pour
varier
ainsi
à
son
gré
les
ouvrages
dont
on
le
suppose
auteur
sans
que
tant
de
diversité
pût
la
même
fin
il
objecte
encore
ces
parties
évidemment
contenues
dans
pour
de
futurs
usages
le
papillon
dans
la
chenille
dans
le
ver
spermatique
un
polype
entier
dans
chacune
de
ses
parties
la
valvule
du
trou
ovale
le
poumon
dans
le
foetus
les
dents
dans
leurs
alvéoles
les
os
dans
les
fluides
qui
détachent
et
se
durcissent
manière
incompréhensible
et
comme
les
partisans
de
ce
système
loin
de
rien
négliger
pour
le
faire
valoir
ne
se
lassent
jamais
preuves
sur
preuves
ils
veulent
profiter
de
tout
et
de
la
faiblesse
même
de
en
certain
cas
voyez
les
spinoza
les
vanini
les
desbarreaux
les
boindin
apôtres
qui
font
plus
que
de
tort
au
déisme
la
durée
de
la
santé
de
ces
derniers
a
été
la
mesure
de
leur
incrédulité
et
il
est
rare
en
effet
pas
dès
que
les
passions
se
sont
affaiblies
avec
le
corps
qui
en
est
voilà
certainement
tout
ce
peut
dire
de
plus
favorable
à
dieu
quoique
le
dernier
argument
soit
frivole
en
ce
que
ces
conversions
sont
courtes
reprenant
presque
toujours
ses
anciennes
opinions
et
se
conduisant
en
conséquence
dès
a
recouvré
ou
plutôt
retrouvé
ses
forces
dans
celles
du
corps
en
voilà
du
moins
beaucoup
plus
que
dit
le
médecin
diderot
dans
ses
pensées
philosophiques
sublime
ouvrage
qui
ne
convaincra
pas
un
athée
que
répondre
en
effet
à
un
homme
qui
dit
nous
ne
connaissons
point
la
nature
des
causes
cachées
dans
son
sein
pourraient
avoir
tout
produit
voyez
à
votre
tour
le
polype
de
trembley
ne
pas
en
soi
les
causes
qui
donnent
lieu
à
sa
régénération
quelle
absurdité
y
donc
à
penser
est
des
causes
physiques
pour
lesquelles
tout
a
été
fait
et
auxquelles
toute
la
chaîne
de
ce
vaste
univers
est
si
nécessairement
liée
et
assujettie
que
rien
de
ce
qui
arrive
ne
pouvait
pas
ne
pas
arriver
des
causes
dont
absolument
invincible
nous
a
fait
recourir
à
un
dieu
qui
pas
même
un
être
de
raison
suivant
certains
ainsi
détruire
le
hasard
ce
pas
prouver
etre
supreme
peut
y
avoir
autre
chose
qui
ne
serait
ni
hasard
ni
dieu
je
veux
dire
la
nature
dont
par
conséquent
ne
peut
faire
que
des
incrédules
comme
le
prouve
la
façon
de
penser
de
tous
ses
plus
heureux
scrutateurs
le
poids
de
donc
pas
un
véritable
athée
loin
de
et
tous
ces
indices
mille
et
mille
fois
rebattus
créateur
indices
met
fort
de
la
façon
de
penser
dans
nos
semblables
ne
sont
évidents
quelque
loin
pousse
cet
argument
que
pour
les
antipyrrhoniens
ou
pour
ceux
qui
ont
assez
de
confiance
dans
leur
raison
pour
croire
pouvoir
juger
sur
certaines
apparences
auxquelles
comme
vous
voyez
les
athées
peuvent
en
opposer
aussi
fortes
et
absolument
contraires
car
si
nous
écoutons
encore
les
naturalistes
ils
nous
diront
que
les
mêmes
causes
qui
dans
les
mains
chimiste
et
par
le
hasard
de
divers
mélanges
ont
fait
le
premier
miroir
dans
celles
de
la
nature
ont
fait
pure
qui
en
sert
à
la
simple
bergère
que
le
mouvement
qui
conserve
le
monde
a
pu
le
créer
que
chaque
corps
a
pris
la
place
que
sa
nature
lui
a
assignée
que
a
dû
entourer
la
terre
par
la
même
raison
que
le
fer
et
les
autres
métaux
sont
de
ses
entrailles
que
le
soleil
est
une
production
aussi
naturelle
que
celle
de
pas
plus
été
fait
pour
échauffer
la
terre
et
tous
ses
habitants
brûle
quelquefois
que
la
pluie
pour
faire
pousser
les
grains
gâte
souvent
que
le
miroir
et
pas
plus
été
faits
pour
pût
regarder
que
tous
les
corps
polis
qui
ont
la
même
propriété
que
est
à
la
vérité
une
espèce
de
trumeau
dans
lequel
peut
contempler
des
objets
tels
lui
sont
représentés
par
ces
corps
mais
pas
démontré
que
cet
organe
ait
été
réellement
fait
exprès
pour
cette
contemplation
ni
exprès
placé
dans
il
se
pourrait
bien
faire
que
lucrèce
le
médecin
lamy
et
tous
les
epicuriens
anciens
et
modernes
eûssent
raison
avancent
que
ne
voit
que
par
ce
se
trouve
organisé
et
placé
comme
il
que
posées
une
fois
les
mêmes
règles
de
mouvement
que
suit
la
nature
dans
la
génération
et
le
développement
des
corps
il
pas
possible
que
ce
merveilleux
organe
fût
organisé
et
placé
autrement
tel
est
le
pour
et
le
contre
et
des
grandes
raisons
qui
partageront
éternellement
les
philosophes
je
ne
prends
aucun
parti

de
mérite
et

meilleur
sort
il
me
fit
à
ce
sujet
une
réponse
fort
singulière
il
est
vrai
me
que
le
pour
et
le
contre
ne
doit
point
inquiéter
philosophe
qui
voit
que
rien
démontré
avec
assez
de
clarté
pour
forcer
son
consentement
et
même
que
les
idées
indicatives
qui
côté
sont
ausitôt
détruites
par
celles
qui
se
montrent
de
cependant
ne
sera
jamais
heureux
à
moins
ne
soit
athée
voici
quelles
étaient
les
raisons
de
cet
abominable
homme
si
était
généralement
répandu
toutes
les
branches
de
la
religion
seraient
alors
détruites
et
coupées
par
la
racine
plus
de
guerres
théologiques
plus
de
soldats
de
religion
soldats
terribles
la
nature
infectée
poison
sacré
reprendrait
ses
droits
et
sa
pureté
sourds
à
toute
autre
voix
les
mortels
tranquilles
ne
suivraient
que
les
conseils
spontanés
de
leur
propre
individu
les
seuls
ne
méprise
point
impunément
et
qui
peuvent
seuls
nous
conduire
au
bonheur
par
les
agréables
sentiers
de
la
vertu
telle
est
la
loi
naturelle
quiconque
en
est
rigide
observateur
est
honnête
homme
et
mérite
la
confiance
de
tout
le
genre
humain
quiconque
ne
la
suit
pas
scrupuleusement
a
beau
affecter
les
spécieux
dehors
autre
religion
est
un
fourbe
ou
un
hypocrite
dont
je
me
défie
après
cela
vain
peuple
pense
différemment
ose
affirmer
y
va
de
la
probité
même
à
ne
pas
croire
la
révélation
faut
en
un
mot
un
autre
religion
que
celle
de
la
nature
quelle
soit
quelle
misère
quelle
pitié
et
la
bonne
opinion
que
chacun
nous
donne
de
celle
a
embrassée
nous
ne
briguons
point
ici
le
suffrage
du
vulgaire
qui
dresse
dans
son
coeur
des
autels
à
la
superstition
est
né
pour
adorer
des
idoles
et
non
pour
sentir
la
vertu
mais
puisque
toutes
les
facultés
de
dépendent
tellement
de
la
propre
organisation
du
cerveau
et
de
tout
le
corps
ne
sont
visiblement
que
cette
organisation
même
voilà
une
machine
bien
éclairée
car
enfin
quand
seul
aurait
reçu
en
partage
la
loi
naturelle
en
moins
une
machine
des
roues
quelques
ressorts
de
plus
que
dans
les
animaux
les
plus
parfaits
le
cerveau
proportionnellement
plus
proche
du
coeur
et
recevant
aussi
plus
de
sang
la
même
raison
donnée
que
enfin
des
causes
inconnues
produiraient
toujours
cette
conscience
délicate
si
facile
à
blesser
ces
remords
qui
ne
sont
pas
plus
étrangers
à
la
matière
que
la
pensée
et
en
un
mot
toute
la
différence
suppose
ici
donc
a
tout
oui
encore
une
fois
puisque
la
pensée
se
développe
visiblement
avec
les
organes
pourquoi
la
matière
dont
ils
sont
faits
ne
pas
aussi
susceptible
de
remords
quand
une
fois
elle
a
acquis
avec
le
temps
la
faculté
de
sentir
donc
vain
terme
dont
on
point
et
dont
un
bon
esprit
ne
doit
se
servir
que
pour
nommer
la
partie
qui
pense
en

posé
le

principe
de

les

auront
tout
ce
leur

pour

ne

rien
ceux
qui
croiraient
que
toutes
les
difficultés
ne

vont
trouver
des

de

les

circonstances
la
seule
chaleur
de

un
animal
prêt
à
périr
dans
la
machine

les
mêmes
expériences
que
nous
devons
à
boyle
et
à
sténon
se
font
dans
les
pigeons
dans
les
chiens
dans
les
lapins
dont
les
morceaux
de
coeur
se
remuent
comme
les
coeurs
entiers
on
voit
le
même
mouvement
dans
les
pattes
de
taupe
arrachées
la
chenille
les
vers
la
mouche
offrent
les
mêmes
choses
à
considérer
et

un
soldat
ivre
emporta
coup
de

la

coq
cet
animal
resta
debout
ensuite
il
marcha
courut
venant
à
rencontrer
une
muraille
il
se
tourna
battit
des
ailes
en
continuant
de
courir
et
tomba
enfin
etendu
par
terre
tous
les
muscles
de
ce
coq
se
remuaient
encore
voilà
ce
que
vu
et
il
est
facile
de
voir
à
peu
près
ces
phénomènes
dans
les
petits
chats
ou
chiens
dont
on
a
coupé
la
tête
les
polypes
font
plus
que
de
se
mouvoir
après
la
section
ils
se
reproduisent
dans
huit
jours
en
autant
y
a
de
parties
coupées
suis
fâché
pour
le
système
des
naturalistes
sur
la
génération
ou
plutôt
suis
bien
aise
car
que
cette
découverte
nous
apprend
bien
à
ne
jamais
rien
conclure
de
général
même
de
toutes
les
expériences
connues
et
les
plus
décisives
voilà
beaucoup
plus
de
faits
faut
pour
prouver
manière
incontestable
que
chaque
petite
fibre
ou
partie
des
corps
organisés
se
meut
par
un
principe
qui
lui
est
propre
et
dont
ne
dépend
point
des
nerfs
comme
les
mouvements
volontaires
puisque
les
mouvements
en
question
sans
que
les
parties
qui
les
manifestent
aient
aucun
commerce
avec
la
circulation
or
si
cette
force
se
fait
remarquer
jusques
dans
des
morceaux
de
fibres
le
coeur
qui
est
un
composé
de
fibres
singulièrement
entrelacées
doit
avoir
la
même
propriété
de
bacon
pas
nécessaire
pour
me
le
persuader
il
facile
juger
et
par
la
parfaite
analogie
de
la
structure
du
coeur
de
et
des
animaux
et
par
la
masse
même
du
premier
dans
laquelle
ce
mouvement
ne
se
cache
aux
yeux
que
parce
y
est
étouffé
et
enfin
parce
que
tout
est
froid
et
affaissé
dans
les
cadavres
si
les
dissections
se
faisaient
sur
des
criminels
suppliciés
dont
les
corps
sont
encore
chauds
on
verrait
dans
leur
coeur
les
mêmes
mouvements
observe
dans
les
muscles
du
visage
des
gens
décapités
tel
est
ce
principe
moteur
des
corps
entiers
ou
des
parties
coupées
en
morceaux
produit
des
mouvements
non
déréglés
comme
on
cru
mais
très
réguliers
et
cela
tant
dans
les
animaux
chauds
et
parfaits
que
dans
ceux
qui
sont
froids
et
imparfaits
il
ne
reste
donc
aucune
ressource
à
nos
adversaires
si
ce
que
de
nier
mille
et
mille
faits
que
chacun
peut
facilement
vérifier
si
on
me
demande
à
présent
quel
est
le
siège
de
cette
force
innée
dans
nos
corps
je
réponds
réside
très
clairement
dans
ce
que
les
anciens
ont
appellé
parenchyme
à
dire
dans
la
substance
propre
des
parties
abstraction
faite
des
veines
des
artères
des
nerfs
en
un
mot
de
de
tout
le
corps
et
que
par
conséquent
chaque
partie
contient
en
soi
des
ressorts
plus
ou
moins
vifs
selon
le
besoin
en
avaient
entrons
dans
quelque
détail
de
ces
ressorts
de
la
machine
humaine
tous
les
mouvements
vitaux
animaux
naturels
et
automatiques
se
font
par
leur
action
pas
machinalement
que
le
corps
se
retire
frappé
de
terreur
à
précipice
inattendu
que
les
paupières
se
baissent
à
la
menace
coup
comme
on
dit
que
la
pupille
au
grand
jour
pour
conserver
la
rétine
et
pour
voir
les
objets
dans
pas
machinalement
que
les
pores
de
la
peau
se
ferment
en
hiver
pour
que
le
froid
ne
pénètre
pas
des
vaisseaux
que
se
soulève
irrité
par
le
poison
par
une
certaine
quantité
par
tous
les
émétiques
que
le
coeur
les
artères
les
muscles
se
contractent
pendant
le
sommeil
comme
pendant
la
veille
que
le
poumon
fait
souflet
continuellement
exercé
pas
machinalement
tous
les
sphincters
de
la
vessie
du
rectum
que
le
coeur
a
une
contraction
plus
forte
que
tout
autre
muscle
que
les
muscles
érecteurs
font
dresser
la
verge
dans
comme
dans
les
animaux
qui
battent
le
ventre
et
même
dans
capable
pour
peu
que
cette
partie
soit
irritée
ce
qui
prouve
pour
le
dire
en
passant
est
un
ressort
singulier
dans
ce
membre
encore
peu
connu
et
qui
produit
des
effets
point
encore
bien
expliqués
malgré
toutes
les
lumières
de
je
ne
pas
davantage
sur
tous
ces
petits
ressorts
subalternes
connus
de
tout
le
monde
mais
il
en
est
un
autre
plus
subtil
et
plus
merveilleux
qui
les
anime
tous
il
est
la
source
de
tous
nos
sentiments
de
tous
nos
plaisirs
de
toutes
nos
passions
de
toutes
nos
pensées
car
le
cerveau
a
ses
muscles
pour
penser
comme
les
jambes
pour
marcher
je
veux
parler
de
ce
principe
incitant
et
impétueux
appelle
enormôn
ce
principe
existe
et
il
a
son
siège
dans
le
cerveau
à
des
nerfs
par
lesquels
il
exerce
son
empire
sur
tout
le
reste
du
corps
par
là
tout
ce
qui
peut
effets
surprenants
des
maladies
de
mais
pour
ne
pas
languir
dans
une
richesse
et
une
fécondité
mal
entendue
il
faut
se
borner
à
un
petit
nombre
de
questions
et
de
réflexions
pourquoi
la
vue
ou
la
simple
idée
belle
femme
nous
des
mouvements
et
des
désirs
singuliers
ce
qui
se
passe
alors
dans
certains
organes
de
la
nature
même
de
ces
organes
point
du
tout
mais
du
commerce
et
de
de
sympathie
de
ces
muscles
avec
il
a
ici
premier
ressort
excité
par
le
bene
placitum
des
anciens
ou
par
de
la
beauté
qui
en
excite
un
autre
lequel
était
fort
assoupi
quand
éveillé
et
comment
cela
si
ce
par
le
désordre
et
le
tumulte
du
sang
et
des
esprits
qui
galopent
avec
une
promptitude
extraordinaire
et
vont
gonfler
les
corps
caverneux
est
des
communications
évidentes
entre
la
mère
et
et
est
dur
de
nier
des
faits
rapportés
par
tulpius
et
par
écrivains
aussi
dignes
de
foi
il
en
a
point
qui
le
soient
plus
nous
croirons
que
par
la
même
voie
que
le
foetus
ressent
de
maternelle
comme
une
cire
molle
reçoit
toutes
sortes
et
que
les
mêmes
traces
ou
envies
de
la
mère
peuvent
sur
le
foetus
sans
que
cela
puisse
se
comprendre
disent
blondel
et
tous
ses
adhérents
ainsi
nous
faisons
réparation
au
malebranche
beaucoup
trop
raillé
de
sa
crédulité
par
les
auteurs
qui
point
observé
près
la
nature
et
ont
voulu
à
leur
idées
voyez
le
portrait
de
ce
fameux
pope
au
moins
le
voltaire
des
anglais
les
efforts
les
nerfs
de
son
génie
sont
peints
sur
sa
physionomie
elle
est
toute
en
convulsion
ses
yeux
sortent
de
ses
sourcils
avec
les
muscles
du
front
pourquoi
que
des
nerfs
est
en
travail
et
que
tout
le
corps
doit
se
ressentir
espèce
aussi
laborieux
avait
une
corde
interne
qui
tirât
ainsi
celles
du
dehors
viendraient
tous
ces
phénomènes
admettre
une
âme
pour
les
expliquer
être
réduit
à
du
esprit
en
effet
si
ce
qui
pense
en
mon
cerveau
pas
une
partie
de
ce
viscère
et
conséquemment
de
tout
le
corps
pourquoi
lorsque
tranquille
dans
mon
lit
je
forme
le
plan
ouvrage
ou
que
je
poursuis
un
raisonnement
abstrait
pourquoi
mon
sang
pourquoi
la
fièvre
de
mon
esprit
dans
mes
veines
aux
hommes
aux
grandes
poètes
à
ceux
sentiment
bien
rendu
ravit
goût
exquis
que
les
charmes
de
la
nature
de
la
vérité
ou
de
la
vertu
transportent
par
leur
enthousiasme
par
ce
vous
diront
avoir
éprouvé
vous
jugerez
de
la
cause
par
les
effets
par
cette
harmonie
que
borelli
seul
anatomiste
a
mieux
connue
que
tous
les
leibniziens
vous
connaîtrez
matérielle
de
car
enfin
si
la
tension
des
nerfs
qui
fait
la
douleur
cause
la
fièvre
par
laquelle
est
troublé
et
plus
de
volonté
et
que
réciproquement
trop
exercé
trouble
le
corps
et
allume
ce
feu
de
consomption
qui
a
enlevé
bayle
dans
un
âge
si
peu
avancé
si
telle
titillation
me
fait
vouloir
me
force
de
désirer
ardemment
ce
dont
je
ne
me
souciais
nullement
le
moment
si
à
leur
tour
certaines
traces
du
cerveau
excitent
le
même
prurit
et
les
mêmes
désirs
pourquoi
faire
double
ce
qui
évidemment
en
vain
se
récrie
sur
de
la
volonté
pour
un
ordre
donne
elle
subit
cent
fois
le
joug
et
quelle
merveille
que
le
corps
obéisse
dan
sain
torrent
de
sang
et
vient
forcer
la
volonté
ayant
pour
ministres
une
légion
invisible
de
fluides
plus
vifs
que
et
toujours
prêts
a
la
servir
mais
comme
par
les
nerfs
que
son
pouvoir
aussi
par
eux
est
arrêté
la
meilleure
volonté
amant
épuisé
les
plus
violents
désirs
lui
sa
vigueur
perdue
hélas
non
et
elle
en
sera
la
première
punie
parceque
posées
certaines
circonstances
il
pas
dans
sa
puissance
de
ne
pas
vouloir
du
plaisir
ce
que
dit
de
la
paralysie
etc
revient
ici
la
jaunisse
vous
surprend
ne
savez
vous
pas
que
la
couleur
des
corps
dépend
de
celle
des
verres
au
travers
desquels
on
les
regarde
que
telle
est
la
teinte
des
humeurs
telle
est
celle
des
objets
au
moins
par
rapport
à
nous
vains
jouets
de
mille
illusions
mais
ôtez
cette
teinte
de
aqueuse
de
faites
couler
la
bile
par
son
tamis
naturel
alors
ayant
yeux
ne
verra
plus
jaune
ce
pas
encore
ainsi
abattant
la
cataracte
ou
en
injectant
le
canal
on
rend
la
vue
aux
aveugles
et
aux
sourds
combien
de
gens
qui
que
charlatans
dans
des
siècles
ignorants
ont
passé
pour
faire
de
grands
miracles
la
belle
âme
et
la
puissante
volonté
qui
ne
peut
agir
que
les
dispositions
du
corps
le
lui
permettent
et
dont
les
goûts
changent
avec
et
la
fièvre
donc
si
les
philosophes
ont
toujours
eu
en
vue
la
santé
du
corps
pour
conserver
celle
de
si
pythagore
a
aussi
soigneusement
ordonné
la
diète
que
platon
a
défendu
le
vin
le
régime
qui
convient
au
corps
est
toujours
celui
par
lequel
les
médecins
sensés
prétendent
doit
préluder
de
former
de
à
la
connaissance
de
la
vérité
et
de
la
vertu
vains
sons
dans
le
désordre
des
maladies
et
le
tumulte
des
sens
sans
les
préceptes
de
epictète
socrate
platon
etc
prêchent
en
vain
toute
morale
est
infructueuse
pour
qui
pas
la
sobrieté
en
partage
la
source
de
toutes
les
vertus
comme
est
celle
de
tous
les
vices
en
davantage
et
pourquoi
me
perdre
dans
des
passions
qui
toutes
par
pour
prouver
que
animal
ou
un
assemblage
de
ressorts
qui
tous
se
montent
les
uns
par
les
autres
sans
puisse
dire
par
quel
point
du
cercle
humain
la
nature
a
commencé
si
ces
ressorts
diffèrent
ce
donc
que
par
leur
siège
et
par
quelques
degrés
de
force
et
jamais
par
leur
nature
et
par
conséquent
principe
de
mouvement
ou
une
partie
matérielle
sensible
du
cerveau
peut
sans
craindre
regarder
comme
un
ressort
principal
de
toute
la
machine
qui
a
une
influence
visible
sur
tous
les
autres
et
même
parait
avoir
été
fait
le
premier
en
sorte
que
tous
les
autres
seraient
émanation
comme
on
le
verra
par
quelques
observations
que
je
rapporterai
et
qui
ont
été
faites
sur
divers
embryons
cette
oscillation
naturelle
ou
propre
à
notre
machine
et
dont
est
douée
chaque
fibre
et
pour
ainsi
dire
chaque
élément
fibreux
semblable
à
celle
pendule
ne
peut
toujours
il
faut
la
renouveler
à
mesure
se
perd
lui
donner
des
forces
quand
elle
languit
est
opprimée
par
un
excès
de
force
et
de
vigueur
en
cela
seul
que
la
vraie
médecine
consiste
le
corps
horloge
dont
le
nouveau
chyle
est
le
premier
soin
de
la
nature
quand
il
entre
dans
le
sang
exciter
une
sorte
de
fièvre
que
les
chimistes
qui
ne
rêvent
que
fourneaux
ont
dû
prendre
pour
une
fermentation
cette
fièvre
procure
une
plus
grande
filtration
qui
machinalement
vont
animer
les
muscles
et
le
coeur
comme
y
étaient
envoyés
par
ordre
de
la
volonté
ce
sont
donc
les
causes
ou
les
forces
de
la
vie
qui
entretiennent
ainsi
durant
ans
le
mouvement
perpétuel
des
solides
et
des
fluides
aussi
nécessaire
aux
uns
autres
mais
qui
peut
dire
si
les
solides
contribuent
à
ce
jeu
plus
que
les
fluides
et
vice
versa
tout
ce
sait
que
des
premiers
serait
bientôt
anéantie
sans
le
secours
des
seconds
ce
sont
les
liqueurs
qui
par
leur
choc
éveillent
et
conservent
des
vaisseaux
de
laquelle
dépend
leur
propre
circulation
de
là
vient
la
mort
le
ressort
naturel
de
chaque
substance
est
plus
ou
moins
fort
encore
suivant
les
restes
de
la
vie
auxquels
il
survit
pour
expirer
le
dernier
tant
il
est
vrai
que
cette
force
des
parties
animales
peut
bien
se
conserver
et
par
celle
de
la
circulation
mais
dépend
point
se
passe
même
de
de
chaque
membre
ou
viscère
comme
on
vu
je
pas
que
cette
opinion
pas
été
goûtée
de
tous
les
savants
et
que
stahl
surtout
fort
dédaignée
ce
grand
chimiste
a
voulu
nous
persuader
que
était
la
seule
cause
de
tous
nos
mouvements
mais
parler
en
fanatique
et
non
en
philosophe
pour
détruire
stahlienne
il
ne
faut
pas
faire
tant
que
je
vois
en
a
faits
avant
moi
il
a
jeter
les
yeux
sur
un
joueur
de
violon
quelle
souplesse
quelle
agilité
dans
les
doigts
les
mouvements
sont
si
prompts
ne
paraît
presque
pas
y
avoir
de
succession
or
je
prie
ou
plutôt
je
défie
les
stahliens
de
me
dire
eux
qui
connaissent
si
bien
tout
ce
que
peut
notre
âme
comment
il
serait
possible
exécutât
si
vite
tant
de
mouvements
des
mouvements
qui
se
passent
si
loin
et
en
tant
divers
supposer
un
joueur
de
flûte
qui
pourrait
faire
de
brillantes
cadences
sur
une
infinité
de
trous
ne
connaitrait
pas
et
auxquels
il
ne
pourrait
seulement
pas
appliquer
le
doigt
mais
disons
avec
hecquet
pas
permis
à
tout
le
monde
à
corinthe
et
pourquoi
stahl
pas
été
encore
plus
favorisé
de
la
nature
en
qualité
qualité
de
chimiste
et
de
praticien
il
fallait
heureux
mortel
eût
reçu
une
autre
âme
que
le
reste
des
hommes
une
âme
souveraine
qui
non
contente
quelque
empire
sur
les
muscles
volontaires
tenait
sans
peine
les
rênes
de
tous
les
mouvements
du
corps
pouvait
les
suspendre
les
calmer
ou
les
exciter
à
son
gré
avec
une
maîtresse
aussi
despotique
dans
les
mains
de
laquelle
étaient
en
quelque
sorte
les
battements
du
coeur
et
les
lois
de
la
circulation
point
de
fièvre
sans
doute
point
de
douleur
point
de
langueur
ni
honteuse
impuissance
ni
facheux
priapisme
veut
et
les
ressorts
jouent
se
dressent
ou
se
débandent
comment
ceux
de
la
machine
de
stahl
se
sitôt
détraqués
qui
a
chez
soi
un
si
grand
médecin
devrait
être
immortel
stahl
au
reste
pas
le
seul
qui
ait
rejeté
le
principe
des
corps
organisés
de
plus
grands
esprits
ne
pas
employé
ont
voulu
expliquer
du
coeur
du
penis
etc
il
a
lire
les
institutions
de
médecine
de
boerhaave
pour
voir
quels
laborieux
et
séduisants
systèmes
faute
une
force
aussi
frappante
dans
tous
les
corps
ce
grand
homme
a
été
obligé
à
la
sueur
de
son
puissant
génie
willis
et
perrault
esprits
plus
faible
trempe
mais
observateurs
assidus
de
la
nature
que
le
fameux
professeur
de
leyde
connue
que
par
autrui
et
eue
pour
ainsi
dire
que
de
la
seconde
main
paraissent
avoir
mieux
aimé
supposer
une
âme
généralement
répandue
par
tout
le
corps
que
le
principe
dont
nous
parlons
mais
dans
cette
hypothèse
qui
fut
celle
de
virgile
et
de
tous
les
epicuriens
hypothèse
que
du
polype
semblerait
favoriser
à
la
première
vue
les
mouvements
qui
survivent
au
sujet
dans
lequel
ils
sont
inhérents
viennent
reste
que
conservent
encore
les
parties
qui
se
contractent
sans
être
désormais
irritées
par
le
sang
et
les
esprits
voit
que
ces
écrivains
dont
les
ouvrages
solides
éclipsent
aisément
toutes
les
fables
philosophiques
ne
se
sont
trompés
que
sur
le
modèle
de
ceux
qui
ont
donné
à
la
matière
la
faculté
de
penser
je
veux
dire
pour
mal
exprimés
en
termes
obscurs
et
qui
ne
signifient
rien
en
effet
ce
que
ce
reste
si
ce
la
force
motrice
des
leibniziens
mal
rendue
par
une
telle
expression
et
que
cependant
perrault
surtout
a
véritablement
entrevue
voy
son
traité
de
la
mécanique
des
animaux
a
présent
est
clairement
démontré
contre
les
cartésiens
les
stahliens
les
malebranchistes
et
les
théologiens
peu
dignes
ici
placés
que
la
matière
se
meut
par
non
seulement
est
organisée
comme
dans
un
coeur
entier
par
exemple
mais
lors
même
que
cette
organisation
est
détruite
la
curiosité
de
voudrait
savoir
comment
un
corps
par
cela
même
est
originairement
doué
souffle
de
vie
se
trouve
en
conséquence
orné
de
la
faculté
de
sentir
et
enfin
par
de
la
pensée
et
pour
en
venir
à
bout
ô
bon
dieu
quels
efforts
pas
faits
certains
philosophes
et
quel
galimatias
eu
la
patience
de
lire
à
ce
sujet
tout
ce
que
nous
apprend
que
tant
que
le
mouvement
subsiste
si
petit
soit
dans
une
ou
plusieurs
fibres
il
a
les
piquer
pour
réveiller
animer
ce
mouvement
presque
éteint
comme
on
vu
dans
cette
foule
dont
voulu
accabler
les
systèmes
il
est
donc
constant
que
le
mouvement
et
le
sentiment
tour
à
tour
et
dans
les
corps
entiers
et
dans
les
mêmes
corps
dont
la
structure
est
détruite
pour
ne
rien
dire
de
certaines
plantes
qui
semblent
nous
offrir
les
mêmes
phénomènes
de
la
réunion
du
sentiment
et
du
mouvement
mais
de
plus
combien
philosophes
ont
démontré
que
la
pensée
faculté
de
sentir
et
que
raisonnable
que
sensitive
appliquée
à
contempler
les
idées
et
à
raisonner
ce
qui
serait
prouvé
par
cela
seul
que
lorsque
le
sentiment
est
éteint
la
pensée
aussi
comme
dans
la
léthargie
la
catalepsie
etc
car
ceux
qui
ont
avancé
que
pas
moins
pensé
dans
les
maladies
soporeuses
ne
se
souvint
pas
des
idées
avait
eues
ont
soutenu
une
chose
ridicule
pour
ce
qui
est
de
ce
développement
une
folie
de
perdre
le
temps
à
en
rechercher
le
mécanisme
la
nature
du
mouvement
nous
est
aussi
inconnue
que
celle
de
la
matière
le
moyen
de
découvrir
comment
il
produit
à
moins
que
de
ressusciter
avec
de
de
et
inintelligible
doctrine
des
formes
substantielles
je
suis
donc
aussi
consolé
comment
la
matière
et
simple
devient
active
et
composée
que
de
ne
pouvoir
regarder
le
soleil
sans
verre
rouge
et
je
suis
bonne
composition
sur
les
autres
merveilles
incompréhensibles
de
la
nature
sur
la
production
du
sentiment
et
de
la
pensée
dans
un
être
qui
ne
paraissait
autrefois
à
nos
yeux
bornés
peu
de
boue
seulement
que
la
matière
organisée
est
douée
principe
moteur
qui
seul
la
différencie
de
celle
qui
ne
pas
eh
rien
refuser
à
la
plus
incontestable
et
que
tout
dépend
dans
les
animaux
de
la
diversité
de
cette
organisation
comme
je
assez
prouvé
est
assez
pour
deviner
des
substances
et
celle
de
on
voit
en
a
dans
et
que
est
la
plus
parfaite
il
est
au
singe
aux
animaux
les
plus
spirituels
ce
que
le
pendule
planétaire
de
huygens
est
à
une
montre
de
julien
le
roi
a
fallu
plus
plus
de
rouages
plus
de
ressorts
pour
marquer
les
mouvements
des
planètes
que
pour
marquer
les
heures
ou
les
répéter
a
fallu
plus
à
vaucanson
pour
faire
son
fluteur
que
pour
son
canard
il
eût
dû
en
employer
encore
davantage
pour
faire
un
parleur
machine
qui
ne
peut
plus
être
regardée
comme
impossible
surtout
entre
les
mains
nouveau
prométhée
il
était
donc
de
même
nécessaire
que
la
nature
employât
plus
et
pour
faire
et
entretenir
une
machine
qui
pendant
un
siècle
entier
pût
marquer
tous
les
battements
du
coeur
et
de
car
si
on
voit
pas
au
pouls
les
heures
du
moins
le
baromètre
de
la
chaleur
et
de
la
vivacité
par
laquelle
on
peut
juger
de
la
nature
de
je
ne
me
trompe
point
le
corps
humain
est
une
horloge
mais
immense
et
construite
avec
tant
et
que
si
la
roue
qui
sert
à
marquer
les
secondes
vient
à
celle
des
minutes
tourne
et
va
toujours
son
train
comme
la
roue
des
quarts
continue
de
se
mouvoir
et
ainsi
des
autres
quand
les
premières
rouillées
ou
dérangées
par
quelque
cause
que
ce
soit
ont
interrompu
leur
marche
car
pas
ainsi
que
de
quelques
vaisseaux
ne
suffit
pas
pour
détruire
ou
suspendre
le
fort
des
mouvements
qui
est
dans
le
coeur
comme
dans
la
pièce
ouvrière
de
la
machine
contraire
les
fluides
dont
le
volume
est
diminué
ayant
moins
de
chemin
a
faire
le
parcourent
plus
vite
emportés
comme
par
un
nouveau
courant
que
la
force
du
coeur
en
raison
de
la
résistance
trouve
à
des
vaisseaux
lorsque
le
nerf
optique
seul
comprimé
ne
laisse
plus
passer
des
objets
pas
ainsi
que
la
privation
de
la
vue
pas
plus
de
que
la
privation
de
ce
sens
lorsque
les
fonctions
de
la
portion
molle
sont
interdites
ne
suppose
celle
de
pas
ainsi
encore
que
entend
sans
pouvoir
dire
entend
si
ce
après
du
mal
et
que
qui
rien
mais
dont
les
nerfs
linguaux
sont
libres
dans
le
cerveau
dit
machinalement
tous
les
rêves
qui
lui
passent
par
la
tête
phénomènes
qui
ne
surprennent
point
les
médecins
éclairés
ils
savent
à
quoi
tenir
sur
la
nature
de
et
pour
le
dire
en
passant
de
deux
médecins
le
meilleur
celui
qui
mérite
le
plus
de
confiance
toujours
à
mon
avis
celui
qui
est
le
plus
versé
dans
la
physique
ou
la
mécanique
du
corps
humain
et
qui
laissant
et
toutes
les
inquiétudes
que
cette
chimère
donne
aux
sots
et
aux
ignorans
occupé
sérieusement
que
du
pur
naturalisme
laissons
donc
le
prétendu
charp
se
moquer
des
philosophes
qui
ont
regardé
les
animaux
comme
des
machines
que
je
pense
différemment
je
crois
que
descartes
serait
un
homme
respectable
à
tous
égards
si
né
dans
un
siècle
pas
dû
éclairer
il
eût
connu
le
prix
de
et
de
et
le
danger
de
écarter
mais
il
pas
moins
juste
que
je
fasse
ici
une
authentique
réparation
à
ce
grand
homme
pour
tous
ces
petits
philosophes
mauvais
plaisants
et
mauvais
singes
de
locke
qui
au
lieu
de
rire
impudemment
au
nez
de
descartes
feraient
mieux
de
sentir
que
sans
lui
le
champ
de
la
philosophie
comme
celui
du
bon
esprit
sans
newton
serait
peut
être
encore
en
friche
il
est
vrai
que
ce
célèbre
philosophe
beaucoup
trompé
et
personne
disconvient
mais
enfin
il
a
connu
la
nature
animale
il
a
le
premier
parfaitement
démontré
que
les
animaux
étaient
de
pures
machines
or
après
une
découverte
de
cette
importance
et
qui
suppose
autant
de
sagacité
le
moyen
sans
ingratitude
de
ne
pas
faire
grâce
à
toutes
ses
erreurs
elles
sont
à
mes
yeux
toutes
réparées
par
ce
grand
aveu
car
enfin
chante
sur
la
distinction
des
deux
substances
il
est
visible
que
ce
tour
une
ruse
de
style
pour
faire
avaler
aux
théologiens
un
poison
caché
à
analogie
qui
frappe
tout
le
monde
et
seuls
ne
voient
pas
car
elle
cette
forte
analogie
qui
force
tous
les
savants
et
les
vrais
juges
que
ces
êtres
fiers
et
vains
plus
distingués
par
leur
orgueil
que
par
le
nom
quelque
envie
aient
de
ne
sont
au
fond
que
des
animaux
et
des
machines
perpendiculairement
rampantes
elles
ont
toutes
ce
merveilleux
instinct
dont
fait
de
et
qui
a
toujours
son
siège
dans
le
cerveau
et
à
son
défaut
comme
manque
ou
est
ossifié
dans
la
moëlle
allongée
et
jamais
dans
le
cervelet
car
je
vu
considérablement
blessé
trouvé
squirreux
sans
que
cessât
de
faire
ses
fonctions
etre
machine
sentir
penser
savoir
distinguer
le
bien
du
mal
comme
le
bleu
du
jaune
en
un
mot
être
né
avec
de
et
un
instinct
sûr
de
morale
et
animal
sont
donc
des
choses
qui
ne
sont
pas
plus
contradictoires
un
singe
ou
un
perroquet
et
savoir
se
donner
du
plaisir
car
puisque
se
présente
de
le
dire
qui
eut
jamais
deviné
à
priori
goutte
de
la
liqueur
qui
se
lance
dans
fit
ressentir
des
plaisirs
divins
et
en
naîtrait
une
petite
créature
qui
pourrait
un
jour
posées
certaines
lois
jouir
des
mêmes
délices
je
crois
la
pensée
si
peu
incompatible
avec
la
matière
organisée
semble
en
être
une
propriété
telle
que
la
faculté
motrice
etc
voulez
vous
de
nouvelles
observations
en
voici
qui
sont
sans
réplique
et
qui
prouvent
toutes
que
ressemble
parfaitement
aux
animaux
dans
son
origine
comme
dans
tout
ce
que
nous
avons
déjà
cru
essentiel
de
comparer
appelle
à
la
bonne
foi
de
nos
observateurs
nous
disent
pas
vrai
que
dans
son
principe
ver
qui
devient
homme
comme
la
chenille
papillon
les
plus
graves
auteurs
nous
ont
appris
comment
il
faut
prendre
pour
voir
cet
animalcule
tous
les
curieux
vu
comme
hartsoeker
dans
la
semence
de
et
non
dans
celle
de
la
femme
il
a
que
les
sots
qui
soient
fait
scrupule
comme
chaque
goutte
de
sperme
contient
une
infinité
de
ces
petits
vers
sont
lancés
à
il
a
que
le
plus
adroit
ou
le
plus
vigoureux
qui
ait
la
force
de
et
de
dans
que
fournit
la
femme
et
qui
lui
donne
sa
première
nourriture
cet
oeuf
quelquefois
surpris
dans
les
trompes
de
fallope
est
porté
par
ces
canaux
à
la
matrice
où
il
prend
racine
comme
un
grain
de
blé
dans
la
terre
mais
y
devienne
monstrueux
par
sa
croissance
de
mois
il
ne
diffère
point
des
oeufs
des
autres
femelles
si
ce
que
sa
peau
ne
se
durcit
jamais
et
se
dilate
prodigieusement
comme
on
en
peut
juger
en
comparant
les
foetus
trouvés
en
situation
et
près
ce
que
eu
le
plaisir
dans
une
femme
morte
un
moment
avant
avec
petits
embryons
très
proches
de
leur
origine
car
alors
toujours
dans
sa
coque
et
dans
qui
gêné
dans
ses
mouvements
cherche
machinalement
à
voir
le
jour
et
pour
y
réussir
il
commence
par
rompre
avec
la
tête
cette
membrane
il
sort
comme
le
poulet
de
la
leur
une
observation
que
je
ne
trouve
nulle
part
que
est
pas
plus
mince
pour
prodigieusement
étendu
semblable
en
cela
à
la
matrice
dont
la
substance
même
se
gonfle
de
sucs
infiltrés
indépendamment
de
la
réplétion
et
du
déploiement
de
tous
ses
coudes
vasculeux
voyons
dans
et
hors
de
sa
coque
examinons
avec
un
microscope
les
plus
jeunes
embryons
de
de
de
ou
de
jours
après
ce
temps
les
yeux
suffisent
que
la
tête
seule
un
petit
oeuf
rond
avec
deux
points
noirs
qui
marquent
les
yeux
avant
ce
temps
tout
étant
plus
informe
on
pulpe
médullaire
qui
est
le
cerveau
dans
lequel
se
forme
des
nerfs
ou
le
principe
du
sentiment
et
le
coeur
qui
a
déjà
par
dans
cette
pulpe
la
faculté
de
battre
le
punctum
saliens
de
malpighi
qui
doit
déjà
une
partie
de
sa
vivacité
à
des
nerfs
ensuite
on
voit
la
tête
allonger
le
col
qui
en
se
dilatant
forme
le
thorax
où
le
coeur
a
déjà
descendu
pour
fixer
après
quoi
vient
le
bas
ventre
cloison
le
diaphragme
sépare
ces
dilatations
donnent
les
bras
les
mains
les
doigts
les
ongles
et
les
poils
les
cuisses

comment
en

celui
que

de

déploreraient
amèrement
le

de

qui
leur
semblerait

car
chaque

sur

sans

à

plein
de

plein
de

pour

de

de

en

pitoyables
fera
sur
la
prétendue
incompatibilité
de
deux
substances
qui
se
touchent
et
se
remuent
sans
cesse
et
tant
restera
du
préjugé
ou
de
la
superstition
sur
la
terre
voilà
mon
système
ou
plutôt
la
vérité
si
je
ne
me
trompe
fort
elle
est
courte
et
simple
dispute
à
présent
qui
voudra
man
a
machine
it
is
not
enough
for
a
wise
man
to
study
nature
and
truth
he
should
dare
state
truth
for
the
benefit
of
the
few
who
are
willing
and
able
to
think
as
for
the
rest
who
are
voluntarily
slaves
of
prejudice
they
can
no
more
attain
truth
than
frogs
can
fly
i
reduce
to
two
the
systems
of
philosophy
which
deal
with
soul
the
first
and
older
system
is
materialism
the
second
is
spiritualism
the
metaphysicians
who
have
hinted
that
matter
may
well
be
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
thought
have
perhaps
not
reasoned
for
there
is
in
this
case
a
certain
advantage
in
their
inadequate
way
of
expressing
their
meaning
in
truth
to
ask
whether
matter
can
think
without
considering
it
otherwise
than
in
itself
is
like
asking
whether
matter
can
tell
time
it
may
be
foreseen
that
we
shall
avoid
this
reef
upon
which
locke
had
the
bad
luck
to
make
shipwreck
the
leibnizians
with
their
monads
have
set
up
an
unintelligible
hypothesis
they
have
rather
spiritualized
matter
than
materialized
the
soul
how
can
we
define
a
being
whose
nature
is
absolutely
unknown
to
us
descartes
and
all
the
cartesians
among
whom
the
followers
of
malebranche
have
long
been
numbered
have
made
the
same
mistake
they
have
taken
for
granted
two
distinct
substances
in
man
as
if
they
had
seen
them
and
positively
counted
them
the
wisest
men
have
declared
that
the
soul
can
not
know
itself
save
by
the
light
of
faith
however
as
reasonable
beings
they
have
thought
that
they
could
reserve
for
themselves
the
right
of
examining
what
the
bible
means
by
the
word
spirit
which
it
uses
in
speaking
of
the
human
soul
and
if
in
their
investigation
they
do
not
agree
with
the
theologians
on
this
point
are
the
theologians
more
in
agreement
among
themselves
on
all
other
points
here
is
the
result
in
a
few
words
of
all
their
reflections
if
there
is
a
god
he
is
the
author
of
nature
as
well
as
of
revelation
he
has
given
us
the
one
to
explain
the
other
and
reason
to
make
them
agree
to
distrust
the
knowledge
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
study
of
animated
bodies
is
to
regard
nature
and
revelation
as
two
contraries
which
destroy
each
the
other
and
consequently
to
dare
uphold
the
absurd
doctrine
that
god
contradicts
himself
in
his
various
works
and
deceives
us
if
there
is
a
revelation
it
can
not
then
contradict
nature
by
nature
only
can
we
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
gospel
of
which
experience
is
the
only
true
interpreter
in
fact
the
commentators
before
our
time
have
only
obscured
the
truth
we
can
judge
of
this
by
the
author
of
the
spectacle
of
nature
it
is
astonishing
he
says
concerning
locke
that
a
man
who
degrades
our
soul
far
enough
to
consider
it
a
soul
of
clay
should
dare
set
up
reason
as
judge
and
sovereign
arbiter
of
the
mysteries
of
faith
for
he
adds
what
an
astonishing
idea
of
christianity
one
would
have
if
one
were
to
follow
reason
not
only
do
these
reflections
fail
to
elucidate
faith
but
they
also
constitute
such
frivolous
objections
to
the
method
of
those
who
undertake
to
interpret
the
scripture
that
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
waste
time
in
refuting
them
the
excellence
of
reason
does
not
depend
on
a
big
word
devoid
of
meaning
immateriality
but
on
the
force
extent
and
perspicuity
of
reason
itself
thus
a
soul
of
clay
which
should
discover
at
one
glance
as
it
were
the
relations
and
the
consequences
of
an
infinite
number
of
ideas
hard
to
understand
would
evidently
be
preferable
to
a
foolish
and
stupid
soul
though
that
were
composed
of
the
most
precious
elements
a
man
is
not
a
philosopher
because
with
pliny
he
blushes
over
the
wretchedness
of
our
origin
what
seems
vile
is
here
the
most
precious
of
things
and
seems
to
be
the
object
of
nature
highest
art
and
most
elaborate
care
but
as
man
even
though
he
should
come
from
an
apparently
still
more
lowly
source
would
yet
be
the
most
perfect
of
all
beings
so
whatever
the
origin
of
his
soul
if
it
is
pure
noble
and
lofty
it
is
a
beautiful
soul
which
dignifies
the
man
endowed
with
it
pluche
second
way
of
reasoning
seems
vicious
to
me
even
in
his
system
which
smacks
a
little
of
fanaticism
for
on
his
view
if
we
have
an
idea
of
faith
as
being
contrary
to
the
clearest
principles
to
the
most
incontestable
truths
we
must
yet
conclude
out
of
respect
for
revelation
and
its
author
that
this
conception
is
false
and
that
we
do
not
yet
understand
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
the
gospel
of
the
two
alternatives
only
one
is
possible
either
everything
is
illusion
nature
as
well
as
revelation
or
experience
alone
can
explain
faith
but
what
can
be
more
ridiculous
than
the
position
of
our
author
can
one
imagine
hearing
a
peripatetic
say
we
ought
not
to
accept
the
experiments
of
torricelli
for
if
we
should
accept
them
if
we
should
rid
ourselves
of
the
horror
of
the
void
what
an
astonishing
philosophy
we
should
have
i
have
shown
how
vicious
the
reasoning
of
pluche
is
in
order
to
prove
in
the
first
place
that
if
there
is
a
revelation
it
is
not
sufficiently
demonstrated
by
the
mere
authority
of
the
church
and
without
any
appeal
to
reason
as
all
those
who
fear
reason
claim
and
in
the
second
place
to
protect
against
all
assault
the
method
of
those
who
would
wish
to
follow
the
path
that
i
open
to
them
of
interpreting
supernatural
things
incomprehensible
in
themselves
in
the
light
of
those
ideas
with
which
nature
has
endowed
us
experience
and
observation
should
therefore
be
our
only
guides
here
both
are
to
be
found
throughout
the
records
of
the
physicians
who
were
philosophers
and
not
in
the
works
of
the
philosophers
who
were
not
physicians
the
former
have
traveled
through
and
illuminated
the
labyrinth
of
man
they
alone
have
laid
bare
to
us
those
springs
of
life
hidden
under
the
external
integument
which
conceals
so
many
wonders
from
our
eyes
they
alone
tranquilly
contemplating
our
soul
have
surprised
it
a
thousand
times
both
in
its
wretchedness
and
in
its
glory
and
they
have
no
more
despised
it
in
the
first
estate
than
they
have
admired
it
in
the
second
thus
to
repeat
only
the
physicians
have
a
right
to
speak
on
this
subject
what
could
the
others
especially
the
theologians
have
to
say
is
it
not
ridiculous
to
hear
them
shamelessly
coming
to
conclusions
about
a
subject
concerning
which
they
have
had
no
means
of
knowing
anything
and
from
which
on
the
contrary
they
have
been
completely
turned
aside
by
obscure
studies
that
have
led
them
to
a
thousand
prejudiced
opinions
in
a
word
to
fanaticism
which
adds
yet
more
to
their
ignorance
of
the
mechanism
of
the
body
but
even
though
we
have
chosen
the
best
guides
we
shall
still
find
many
thorns
and
stumbling
blocks
in
the
way
man
is
so
complicated
a
machine
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
the
machine
beforehand
and
hence
impossible
to
define
it
for
this
reason
all
the
investigations
have
been
vain
which
the
greatest
philosophers
have
made
à
priori
that
is
to
say
in
so
far
as
they
use
as
it
were
the
wings
of
the
spirit
thus
it
is
only
à
posteriori
or
by
trying
to
disentangle
the
soul
from
the
organs
of
the
body
so
to
speak
that
one
can
reach
the
highest
probability
concerning
man
own
nature
even
though
one
can
not
discover
with
certainty
what
his
nature
is
let
us
then
take
in
our
hands
the
staff
of
experience
paying
no
heed
to
the
accounts
of
all
the
idle
theories
of
philosophers
to
be
blind
and
to
think
that
one
can
do
without
this
staff
is
the
worst
kind
of
blindness
how
truly
a
contemporary
writer
says
that
only
vanity
fails
to
gather
from
secondary
causes
the
same
lessons
as
from
primary
causes
one
can
and
one
even
ought
to
admire
all
these
fine
geniuses
in
their
most
useless
works
such
men
as
descartes
malebranche
leibniz
wolff
and
the
rest
but
what
profit
i
ask
has
any
one
gained
from
their
profound
meditations
and
from
all
their
works
let
us
start
out
then
to
discover
not
what
has
been
thought
but
what
must
be
thought
for
the
sake
of
repose
in
life
there
are
as
many
different
minds
different
characters
and
different
customs
as
there
are
different
temperaments
even
galen
knew
this
truth
which
descartes
carried
so
far
as
to
claim
that
medicine
alone
can
change
minds
and
morals
along
with
bodies
by
the
writer
of
de
this
teaching
is
incorrectly
attributed
to
hippocrates
it
is
true
that
melancholy
bile
phlegm
blood
according
to
the
nature
the
abundance
and
the
different
combination
of
these
humors
make
each
man
different
from
another
in
disease
the
soul
is
sometimes
hidden
showing
no
sign
of
life
sometimes
it
is
so
inflamed
by
fury
that
it
seems
to
be
doubled
sometimes
imbecility
vanishes
and
the
convalescence
of
an
idiot
produces
a
wise
man
sometimes
again
the
greatest
genius
becomes
imbecile
and
loses
the
sense
of
self
adieu
then
to
all
that
fine
knowledge
acquired
at
so
high
a
price
and
with
so
much
trouble
here
is
a
paralytic
who
asks
if
his
leg
is
in
bed
with
him
there
is
a
soldier
who
thinks
that
he
still
has
the
arm
which
has
been
cut
off
the
memory
of
his
old
sensations
and
of
the
place
to
which
they
were
referred
by
his
soul
is
the
cause
of
his
illusion
and
of
this
kind
of
delirium
the
mere
mention
of
the
member
which
he
has
lost
is
enough
to
recall
it
to
his
mind
and
to
make
him
feel
all
its
motions
and
this
causes
him
an
indefinable
and
inexpressible
kind
of
imaginary
suffering
this
man
cries
like
a
child
at
death
approach
while
this
other
jests
what
was
needed
to
change
the
bravery
of
caius
julius
seneca
or
petronius
into
cowardice
or
faintheartedness
merely
an
obstruction
in
the
spleen
in
the
liver
an
impediment
in
the
portal
vein
why
because
the
imagination
is
obstructed
along
with
the
viscera
and
this
gives
rise
to
all
the
singular
phenomena
of
hysteria
and
hypochondria
what
can
i
add
to
the
stories
already
told
of
those
who
imagine
themselves
transformed
into
cocks
or
vampires
or
of
those
who
think
that
the
dead
feed
upon
them
why
should
i
stop
to
speak
of
the
man
who
imagines
that
his
nose
or
some
other
member
is
of
glass
the
way
to
help
this
man
regain
his
faculties
and
his
own
nose
is
to
advise
him
to
sleep
on
hay
lest
he
break
the
fragile
organ
and
then
to
set
fire
to
the
hay
that
he
may
be
afraid
of
being
burned
a
fear
which
has
sometimes
cured
paralysis
but
i
must
touch
lightly
on
facts
which
everybody
knows
neither
shall
i
dwell
long
on
the
details
of
the
effects
of
sleep
here
a
tired
soldier
snores
in
a
trench
in
the
middle
of
the
thunder
of
hundreds
of
cannon
his
soul
hears
nothing
his
sleep
is
as
deep
as
apoplexy
a
bomb
is
on
the
point
of
crushing
him
he
will
feel
this
less
perhaps
than
he
feels
an
insect
which
is
under
his
foot
on
the
other
hand
this
man
who
is
devoured
by
jealousy
hatred
avarice
or
ambition
can
never
find
any
rest
the
most
peaceful
spot
the
freshest
and
most
calming
drinks
are
alike
useless
to
one
who
has
not
freed
his
heart
from
the
torment
of
passion
the
soul
and
the
body
fall
asleep
together
as
the
motion
of
the
blood
is
calmed
a
sweet
feeling
of
peace
and
quiet
spreads
through
the
whole
mechanism
the
soul
feels
itself
little
by
little
growing
heavy
as
the
eyelids
droop
and
loses
its
tenseness
as
the
fibres
of
the
brain
relax
thus
little
by
little
it
becomes
as
if
paralyzed
and
with
it
all
the
muscles
of
the
body
these
can
no
longer
sustain
the
weight
of
the
head
and
the
soul
can
no
longer
bear
the
burden
of
thought
it
is
in
sleep
as
if
it
were
not
is
the
circulation
too
quick
the
soul
can
not
sleep
is
the
soul
too
much
excited
the
blood
can
not
be
quieted
it
gallops
through
the
veins
with
an
audible
murmur
such
are
the
two
opposite
causes
of
insomnia
a
single
fright
in
the
midst
of
our
dreams
makes
the
heart
beat
at
double
speed
and
snatches
us
from
needed
and
delicious
repose
as
a
real
grief
or
an
urgent
need
would
do
lastly
as
the
mere
cessation
of
the
functions
of
the
soul
produces
sleep
there
are
even
when
we
are
awake
or
at
least
when
we
are
half
awake
kinds
of
very
frequent
short
naps
of
the
mind
vergers
dreams
which
show
that
the
soul
does
not
always
wait
for
the
body
to
sleep
for
if
the
soul
is
not
fast
asleep
it
surely
is
not
far
from
sleep
since
it
can
not
point
out
a
single
object
to
which
it
has
attended
among
the
uncounted
number
of
confused
ideas
which
so
to
speak
fill
the
atmosphere
of
our
brains
like
clouds
opium
is
too
closely
related
to
the
sleep
it
produces
to
be
left
out
of
consideration
here
this
drug
intoxicates
like
wine
coffee
each
in
its
own
measure
and
according
to
the
dose
it
makes
a
man
happy
in
a
state
which
would
seemingly
be
the
tomb
of
feeling
as
it
is
the
image
of
death
how
sweet
is
this
lethargy
the
soul
would
long
never
to
emerge
from
it
for
the
soul
has
been
a
prey
to
the
most
intense
sorrow
but
now
feels
only
the
joy
of
suffering
past
and
of
sweetest
peace
opium
even
alters
the
will
forcing
the
soul
which
wished
to
wake
and
to
enjoy
life
to
sleep
in
spite
of
itself
i
shall
omit
any
reference
to
the
effect
of
poisons
coffee
the
antidote
for
wine
by
scourging
the
imagination
cures
our
headaches
and
scatters
our
cares
without
laying
up
for
us
as
wine
does
other
headaches
for
the
morrow
but
let
us
contemplate
the
soul
in
its
other
needs
the
human
body
is
a
machine
which
winds
its
own
springs
it
is
the
living
image
of
perpetual
movement
nourishment
keeps
up
the
movements
which
fever
excites
without
food
the
soul
pines
away
goes
mad
and
dies
exhausted
the
soul
is
a
taper
whose
light
flares
up
the
moment
before
it
goes
out
but
nourish
the
body
pour
into
its
veins
juices
and
strong
liquors
and
then
the
soul
grows
strong
like
them
as
if
arming
itself
with
a
proud
courage
and
the
soldier
whom
water
would
have
made
flee
grows
bold
and
runs
joyously
to
death
to
the
sound
of
drums
thus
a
hot
drink
sets
into
stormy
movement
the
blood
which
a
cold
drink
would
have
calmed
what
power
there
is
in
a
meal
joy
revives
in
a
sad
heart
and
infects
the
souls
of
comrades
who
express
their
delight
in
the
friendly
songs
in
which
the
frenchman
excels
the
melancholy
man
alone
is
dejected
and
the
studious
man
is
equally
out
of
place
in
such
company
raw
meat
makes
animals
fierce
and
it
would
have
the
same
effect
on
man
this
is
so
true
that
the
english
who
eat
meat
red
and
bloody
and
not
as
well
done
as
ours
seem
to
share
more
or
less
in
the
savagery
due
to
this
kind
of
food
and
to
other
causes
which
can
be
rendered
ineffective
by
education
only
this
savagery
creates
in
the
soul
pride
hatred
scorn
of
other
nations
indocility
and
other
sentiments
which
degrade
the
character
just
as
heavy
food
makes
a
dull
and
heavy
mind
whose
usual
traits
are
laziness
and
indolence
pope
understood
well
the
full
power
of
greediness
when
he
said
catius
is
ever
moral
ever
grave
thinks
who
endures
a
knave
is
next
a
knave
save
just
at
dinner
then
prefers
no
doubt
a
rogue
with
to
a
saint
without
elsewhere
he
says
see
the
same
man
in
vigor
in
the
gout
alone
in
company
in
place
or
out
early
at
business
and
at
hazard
late
mad
at
a
fox
chase
wise
at
a
debate
drunk
at
a
borough
civil
at
a
ball
friendly
at
hackney
faithless
at
white
hall
in
switzerland
we
had
a
bailiff
by
the
name
of
steigner
de
wittighofen
when
he
fasted
he
was
a
most
upright
and
even
a
most
indulgent
judge
but
woe
to
the
unfortunate
man
whom
he
found
on
the
culprit
bench
after
he
had
had
a
large
dinner
he
was
capable
of
sending
the
innocent
like
the
guilty
to
the
gallows
we
think
we
are
and
in
fact
we
are
good
men
only
as
we
are
gay
or
brave
everything
depends
on
the
way
our
machine
is
running
one
is
sometimes
inclined
to
say
that
the
soul
is
situated
in
the
stomach
and
that
van
helmont
who
said
that
the
seat
of
the
soul
was
in
the
pylorus
made
only
the
mistake
of
taking
the
part
for
the
whole
to
what
excesses
cruel
hunger
can
bring
us
we
no
longer
regard
even
our
own
parents
and
children
we
tear
them
to
pieces
eagerly
and
make
horrible
banquets
of
them
and
in
the
fury
with
which
we
are
carried
away
the
weakest
is
always
the
prey
of
the
strongest
one
needs
only
eyes
to
see
the
necessary
influence
of
old
age
on
reason
the
soul
follows
the
progress
of
the
body
as
it
does
the
progress
of
education
in
the
weaker
sex
the
soul
accords
also
with
delicacy
of
temperament
and
from
this
delicacy
follow
tenderness
affection
quick
feelings
due
more
to
passion
than
to
reason
prejudices
and
superstitions
whose
strong
impress
can
hardly
be
effaced
man
on
the
other
hand
whose
brain
and
nerves
partake
of
the
firmness
of
all
solids
has
not
only
stronger
features
but
also
a
more
vigorous
mind
education
which
women
lack
strengthens
his
mind
still
more
thus
with
such
help
of
nature
and
art
why
should
not
a
man
be
more
grateful
more
generous
more
constant
in
friendship
stronger
in
adversity
but
to
follow
almost
exactly
the
thought
of
the
author
of
the
lettres
sur
la
physiognomie
the
sex
which
unites
the
charms
of
the
mind
and
of
the
body
with
almost
all
the
tenderest
and
most
delicate
feelings
of
the
heart
should
not
envy
us
the
two
capacities
which
seem
to
have
been
given
to
man
the
one
merely
to
enable
him
better
to
fathom
the
allurements
of
beauty
and
the
other
merely
to
enable
him
to
minister
better
to
its
pleasures
it
is
no
more
necessary
to
be
just
as
great
a
physiognomist
as
this
author
in
order
to
guess
the
quality
of
the
mind
from
the
countenance
or
the
shape
of
the
features
provided
these
are
sufficiently
marked
than
it
is
necessary
to
be
a
great
doctor
to
recognize
a
disease
accompanied
by
all
its
marked
symptoms
look
at
the
portraits
of
locke
of
steele
of
boerhaave
of
maupertuis
and
the
rest
and
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
strong
faces
and
eagle
eyes
look
over
a
multitude
of
others
and
you
can
always
distinguish
the
man
of
talent
from
the
man
of
genius
and
often
even
an
honest
man
from
a
scoundrel
for
example
it
has
been
noticed
that
a
celebrated
poet
combines
in
his
portrait
the
look
of
a
pickpocket
with
the
fire
of
prometheus
history
provides
us
with
a
noteworthy
example
of
the
power
of
temperature
the
famous
duke
of
guise
was
so
strongly
convinced
that
henry
the
third
in
whose
power
he
had
so
often
been
would
never
dare
assassinate
him
that
he
went
to
blois
when
the
chancelor
chiverny
learned
of
the
duke
departure
he
cried
he
is
lost
after
this
fatal
prediction
had
been
fulfilled
by
the
event
chiverny
was
asked
why
he
made
it
i
have
known
the
king
for
twenty
years
said
he
he
is
naturally
kind
and
even
weakly
indulgent
but
i
have
noticed
that
when
it
is
cold
it
takes
nothing
at
all
to
provoke
him
and
send
him
into
a
passion
one
nation
is
of
heavy
and
stupid
wit
and
another
quick
light
and
penetrating
whence
comes
this
difference
if
not
in
part
from
the
difference
in
foods
and
difference
in
inheritance
and
in
part
from
the
mixture
of
the
diverse
elements
which
float
around
in
the
immensity
of
the
void
the
mind
like
the
body
has
its
contagious
diseases
and
its
scurvy
such
is
the
influence
of
climate
that
a
man
who
goes
from
one
climate
to
another
feels
the
change
in
spite
of
himself
he
is
a
walking
plant
which
has
transplanted
itself
if
the
climate
is
not
the
same
it
will
surely
either
degenerate
or
improve
furthermore
we
catch
everything
from
those
with
whom
we
come
in
contact
their
gestures
their
accent
etc
just
as
the
eyelid
is
instinctively
lowered
when
a
blow
is
foreseen
or
as
for
the
same
reason
the
body
of
the
spectator
mechanically
imitates
in
spite
of
himself
all
the
motions
of
a
good
mimic
from
what
i
have
just
said
it
follows
that
a
brilliant
man
is
his
own
best
company
unless
he
can
find
other
company
of
the
same
sort
in
the
society
of
the
unintelligent
the
mind
grows
rusty
for
lack
of
exercise
as
at
tennis
a
ball
that
is
served
badly
is
badly
returned
i
should
prefer
an
intelligent
man
without
an
education
if
he
were
still
young
enough
to
a
man
badly
educated
a
badly
trained
mind
is
like
an
actor
whom
the
provinces
have
spoiled
thus
the
diverse
states
of
the
soul
are
always
correlative
with
those
of
the
body
but
the
better
to
show
this
dependence
in
its
completeness
and
its
causes
let
us
here
make
use
of
comparative
anatomy
let
us
lay
bare
the
organs
of
man
and
of
animals
how
can
human
nature
be
known
if
we
may
not
derive
any
light
from
an
exact
comparison
of
the
structure
of
man
and
of
animals
in
general
the
form
and
the
structure
of
the
brains
of
quadrupeds
are
almost
the
same
as
those
of
the
brain
of
man
the
same
shape
the
same
arrangement
everywhere
with
this
essential
difference
that
of
all
the
animals
man
is
the
one
whose
brain
is
largest
and
in
proportion
to
its
mass
more
convoluted
than
the
brain
of
any
other
animal
then
come
the
monkey
the
beaver
the
elephant
the
dog
the
fox
the
cat
these
animals
are
most
like
man
for
among
them
too
one
notes
the
same
progressive
analogy
in
relation
to
the
corpus
callosum
in
which
lancisi
anticipating
the
late
de
la
peyronie
established
the
seat
of
the
soul
the
latter
however
illustrated
the
theory
by
innumerable
experiments
next
after
all
the
quadrupeds
birds
have
the
largest
brains
fish
have
large
heads
but
these
are
void
of
sense
like
the
heads
of
many
men
fish
have
no
corpus
callosum
and
very
little
brain
while
insects
entirely
lack
brain
i
shall
not
launch
out
into
any
more
detail
about
the
varieties
of
nature
nor
into
conjectures
concerning
them
for
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
both
as
any
one
can
see
by
reading
no
further
than
the
treatises
of
willis
de
cerebro
and
de
anima
brutorum
i
shall
draw
the
conclusions
which
follow
clearly
from
these
incontestable
observations
that
the
fiercer
animals
are
the
less
brain
they
have
that
this
organ
seems
to
increase
in
size
in
proportion
to
the
gentleness
of
the
animal
that
nature
seems
here
eternally
to
impose
a
singular
condition
that
the
more
one
gains
in
intelligence
the
more
one
loses
in
instinct
does
this
bring
gain
or
loss
do
not
think
however
that
i
wish
to
infer
by
that
that
the
size
alone
of
the
brain
is
enough
to
indicate
the
degree
of
tameness
in
animals
the
quality
must
correspond
to
the
quantity
and
the
solids
and
liquids
must
be
in
that
due
equilibrium
which
constitutes
health
if
as
is
ordinarily
observed
the
imbecile
does
not
lack
brain
his
brain
will
be
deficient
in
its
consistency
for
instance
in
being
too
soft
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
insane
and
the
defects
of
their
brains
do
not
always
escape
our
investigation
but
if
the
causes
of
imbecility
insanity
are
not
obvious
where
shall
we
look
for
the
causes
of
the
diversity
of
all
minds
they
would
escape
the
eyes
of
a
lynx
and
of
an
argus
a
mere
nothing
a
tiny
fibre
something
that
could
never
be
found
by
the
most
delicate
anatomy
would
have
made
of
erasmus
and
fontenelle
two
idiots
and
fontenelle
himself
speaks
of
this
very
fact
in
one
of
his
best
dialogues
willis
has
noticed
in
addition
to
the
softness
of
the
in
children
puppies
and
birds
that
the
corpora
striata
are
obliterated
and
discolored
in
all
these
animals
and
that
the
striations
are
as
imperfectly
formed
as
in
paralytics
however
cautious
and
reserved
one
may
be
about
the
consequences
that
can
be
deduced
from
these
observations
and
from
many
others
concerning
the
kind
of
variation
in
the
organs
nerves
one
must
admit
that
so
many
different
varieties
can
not
be
the
gratuitous
play
of
nature
they
prove
at
least
the
necessity
for
a
good
and
vigorous
physical
organization
since
throughout
the
animal
kingdom
the
soul
gains
force
with
the
body
and
acquires
keenness
as
the
body
gains
strength
let
us
pause
to
contemplate
the
varying
capacity
of
animals
to
learn
doubtless
the
analogy
best
framed
leads
the
mind
to
think
that
the
causes
we
have
mentioned
produce
all
the
difference
that
is
found
between
animals
and
men
although
we
must
confess
that
our
weak
understanding
limited
to
the
coarsest
observations
can
not
see
the
bonds
that
exist
between
cause
and
effects
this
is
a
kind
of
harmony
that
philosophers
will
never
know
among
animals
some
learn
to
speak
and
sing
they
remember
tunes
and
strike
the
notes
as
exactly
as
a
musician
others
for
instance
the
ape
show
more
intelligence
and
yet
can
not
learn
music
what
is
the
reason
for
this
except
some
defect
in
the
organs
of
speech
but
is
this
defect
so
essential
to
the
structure
that
it
could
never
be
remedied
in
a
word
would
it
be
absolutely
impossible
to
teach
the
ape
a
language
i
do
not
think
so
i
should
choose
a
large
ape
in
preference
to
any
other
until
by
some
good
fortune
another
kind
should
be
discovered
more
like
us
for
nothing
prevents
there
being
such
an
one
in
regions
unknown
to
us
the
ape
resembles
us
so
strongly
that
naturalists
have
called
it
wild
man
or
man
of
the
woods
i
should
take
it
in
the
condition
of
the
pupils
of
amman
that
is
to
say
i
should
not
want
it
to
be
too
young
or
too
old
for
apes
that
are
brought
to
europe
are
usually
too
old
i
would
choose
the
one
with
the
most
intelligent
face
and
the
one
which
in
a
thousand
little
ways
best
lived
up
to
its
look
of
intelligence
finally
not
considering
myself
worthy
to
be
his
master
i
should
put
him
in
the
school
of
that
excellent
teacher
whom
i
have
just
named
or
with
another
teacher
equally
skilful
if
there
is
one
you
know
by
amman
work
and
by
all
those
who
have
interpreted
his
method
all
the
wonders
he
has
been
able
to
accomplish
for
those
born
deaf
in
their
eyes
he
discovered
ears
as
he
himself
explains
and
in
how
short
a
time
in
short
he
taught
them
to
hear
speak
read
and
write
i
grant
that
a
deaf
person
eyes
see
more
clearly
and
are
keener
than
if
he
were
not
deaf
for
the
loss
of
one
member
or
sense
can
increase
the
strength
or
acuteness
of
another
but
apes
see
and
hear
they
understand
what
they
hear
and
see
and
grasp
so
perfectly
the
signs
that
are
made
to
them
that
i
doubt
not
that
they
would
surpass
the
pupils
of
amman
in
any
other
game
or
exercise
why
then
should
the
education
of
monkeys
be
impossible
why
might
not
the
monkey
by
dint
of
great
pains
at
last
imitate
after
the
manner
of
deaf
mutes
the
motions
necessary
for
pronunciation
i
do
not
dare
decide
whether
the
monkey
organs
of
speech
however
trained
would
be
incapable
of
articulation
but
because
of
the
great
analogy
between
ape
and
man
and
because
there
is
no
known
animal
whose
external
and
internal
organs
so
strikingly
resemble
man
it
would
surprise
me
if
speech
were
absolutely
impossible
to
the
ape
locke
who
was
certainly
never
suspected
of
credulity
found
no
difficulty
in
believing
the
story
told
by
sir
william
temple
in
his
memoirs
about
a
parrot
which
could
answer
rationally
and
which
had
learned
to
carry
on
a
kind
of
connected
conversation
as
we
do
i
know
that
people
have
ridiculed
this
great
metaphysician
but
suppose
some
one
should
have
announced
that
reproduction
sometimes
takes
place
without
eggs
or
a
female
would
he
have
found
many
partisans
yet
trembley
has
found
cases
where
reproduction
takes
place
without
copulation
and
by
fission
would
not
amman
too
have
passed
for
mad
if
he
had
boasted
that
he
could
instruct
scholars
like
his
in
so
short
a
time
before
he
had
happily
accomplished
the
feat
his
successes
have
however
astonished
the
world
and
he
like
the
author
of
the
history
of
polyps
has
risen
to
immortality
at
one
bound
whoever
owes
the
miracles
that
he
works
to
his
own
genius
surpasses
in
my
opinion
the
man
who
owes
his
to
chance
he
who
has
discovered
the
art
of
adorning
the
most
beautiful
of
the
kingdoms
of
nature
and
of
giving
it
perfections
that
it
did
not
have
should
be
rated
above
an
idle
creator
of
frivolous
systems
or
a
painstaking
author
of
sterile
discoveries
amman
discoveries
are
certainly
of
a
much
greater
value
he
has
freed
men
from
the
instinct
to
which
they
seemed
to
be
condemned
and
has
given
them
ideas
intelligence
or
in
a
word
a
soul
which
they
would
never
have
had
what
greater
power
than
this
let
us
not
limit
the
resources
of
nature
they
are
infinite
especially
when
reinforced
by
great
art
could
not
the
device
which
opens
the
eustachian
canal
of
the
deaf
open
that
of
apes
might
not
a
happy
desire
to
imitate
the
pronunciation
liberate
the
organs
of
speech
in
animals
that
imitate
so
many
other
signs
with
such
skill
and
intelligence
not
only
do
i
defy
any
one
to
name
any
really
conclusive
experiment
which
proves
my
view
impossible
and
absurd
but
such
is
the
likeness
of
the
structure
and
functions
of
the
ape
to
ours
that
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
if
this
animal
were
properly
trained
he
might
at
last
be
taught
to
pronounce
and
consequently
to
know
a
language
then
he
would
no
longer
be
a
wild
man
nor
a
defective
man
but
he
would
be
a
perfect
man
a
little
gentleman
with
as
much
matter
or
muscle
as
we
have
for
thinking
and
profiting
by
his
education
the
transition
from
animals
to
man
is
not
violent
as
true
philosophers
will
admit
what
was
man
before
the
invention
of
words
and
the
knowledge
of
language
an
animal
of
his
own
species
with
much
less
instinct
than
the
others
in
those
days
he
did
not
consider
himself
king
over
the
other
animals
nor
was
he
distinguished
from
the
ape
and
from
the
rest
except
as
the
ape
itself
differs
from
the
other
animals
by
a
more
intelligent
face
reduced
to
the
bare
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
leibnizians
he
saw
only
shapes
and
colors
without
being
able
to
distinguish
between
them
the
same
old
as
young
child
at
all
ages
he
lisped
out
his
sensations
and
his
needs
as
a
dog
that
is
hungry
or
tired
of
sleeping
asks
for
something
to
eat
or
for
a
walk
words
languages
laws
sciences
and
the
fine
arts
have
come
and
by
them
finally
the
rough
diamond
of
our
mind
has
been
polished
man
has
been
trained
in
the
same
way
as
animals
he
has
become
an
author
as
they
became
beasts
of
burden
a
geometrician
has
learned
to
perform
the
most
difficult
demonstrations
and
calculations
as
a
monkey
has
learned
to
take
his
little
hat
off
and
on
and
to
mount
his
tame
dog
all
has
been
accomplished
through
signs
every
species
has
learned
what
it
could
understand
and
in
this
way
men
have
acquired
symbolic
knowledge
still
so
called
by
our
german
philosophers
nothing
as
any
one
can
see
is
so
simple
as
the
mechanism
of
our
education
everything
may
be
reduced
to
sounds
or
words
that
pass
from
the
mouth
of
one
through
the
ears
of
another
into
his
brain
at
the
same
moment
he
perceives
through
his
eyes
the
shape
of
the
bodies
of
which
these
words
are
the
arbitrary
signs
but
who
was
the
first
to
speak
who
was
the
first
teacher
of
the
human
race
who
invented
the
means
of
utilizing
the
plasticity
of
our
organism
i
can
not
answer
the
names
of
these
first
splendid
geniuses
have
been
lost
in
the
night
of
time
but
art
is
the
child
of
nature
so
nature
must
have
long
preceded
it
we
must
think
that
the
men
who
were
the
most
highly
organized
those
on
whom
nature
had
lavished
her
richest
gifts
taught
the
others
they
could
not
have
heard
a
new
sound
for
instance
nor
experienced
new
sensations
nor
been
struck
by
all
the
varied
and
beautiful
objects
that
compose
the
ravishing
spectacle
of
nature
without
finding
themselves
in
the
state
of
mind
of
the
deaf
man
of
chartres
whose
experience
was
first
related
by
the
great
fontenelle
when
at
forty
years
he
heard
for
the
first
time
the
astonishing
sound
of
bells
would
it
be
absurd
to
conclude
from
this
that
the
first
mortals
tried
after
the
manner
of
this
deaf
man
or
like
animals
and
like
mutes
another
kind
of
animals
to
express
their
new
feelings
by
motions
depending
on
the
nature
of
their
imagination
and
therefore
afterwards
by
spontaneous
sounds
distinctive
of
each
animal
as
the
natural
expression
of
their
surprise
their
joy
their
ecstasies
and
their
needs
for
doubtless
those
whom
nature
endowed
with
finer
feeling
had
also
greater
facility
in
expression
that
is
the
way
in
which
i
think
men
have
used
their
feeling
and
their
instinct
to
gain
intelligence
and
then
have
employed
their
intelligence
to
gain
knowledge
those
are
the
ways
so
far
as
i
can
understand
them
in
which
men
have
filled
the
brain
with
the
ideas
for
the
reception
of
which
nature
made
it
nature
and
man
have
helped
each
other
and
the
smallest
beginnings
have
little
by
little
increased
until
everything
in
the
universe
could
be
as
easily
described
as
a
circle
as
a
violin
string
or
a
harpsichord
key
vibrates
and
gives
forth
sound
so
the
cerebral
fibres
struck
by
waves
of
sound
are
stimulated
to
render
or
repeat
the
words
that
strike
them
and
as
the
structure
of
the
brain
is
such
that
when
eyes
well
formed
for
seeing
have
once
perceived
the
image
of
objects
the
brain
can
not
help
seeing
their
images
and
their
differences
so
when
the
signs
of
these
differences
have
been
traced
or
imprinted
in
the
brain
the
soul
necessarily
examines
their
relations
an
examination
that
would
have
been
impossible
without
the
discovery
of
signs
or
the
invention
of
language
at
the
time
when
the
universe
was
almost
dumb
the
attitude
toward
all
objects
was
that
of
a
man
without
any
idea
of
proportion
toward
a
picture
or
a
piece
of
sculpture
in
which
he
could
distinguish
nothing
or
the
soul
was
like
a
little
child
for
the
soul
was
then
in
its
infancy
who
holding
in
his
hand
small
bits
of
straw
or
wood
sees
them
in
a
vague
and
superficial
way
without
being
able
to
count
or
distinguish
them
but
let
some
one
attach
a
kind
of
banner
or
standard
to
this
bit
of
wood
which
perhaps
is
called
a
mast
and
another
banner
to
another
similar
object
let
the
first
be
known
by
the
symbol
and
the
second
by
the
symbol
or
number
then
the
child
will
be
able
to
count
the
objects
and
in
this
way
he
will
learn
all
of
arithmetic
as
soon
as
one
figure
seems
equal
to
another
in
its
numerical
sign
he
will
decide
without
difficulty
that
they
are
two
different
bodies
that
make
and
make
etc
this
real
or
apparent
likeness
of
figures
is
the
fundamental
basis
of
all
truths
and
of
all
we
know
among
these
sciences
evidently
those
whose
signs
are
less
simple
and
less
sensible
are
harder
to
understand
than
the
others
because
more
talent
is
required
to
comprehend
and
combine
the
immense
number
of
words
by
which
such
sciences
express
the
truths
in
their
province
on
the
other
hand
the
sciences
that
are
expressed
by
numbers
or
by
other
small
signs
are
easily
learned
and
without
doubt
this
facility
rather
than
its
demonstrability
is
what
has
made
the
fortune
of
algebra
all
this
knowledge
with
which
vanity
fills
the
brains
of
our
proud
pedants
is
therefore
but
a
huge
mass
of
words
and
figures
which
form
in
the
brain
all
the
marks
by
which
we
distinguish
and
recall
objects
all
our
ideas
are
awakened
after
the
fashion
in
which
the
gardener
who
knows
plants
recalls
all
stages
of
their
growth
at
sight
of
them
these
words
and
the
objects
designated
by
them
are
so
connected
in
the
brain
that
it
is
comparatively
rare
to
imagine
a
thing
without
the
name
or
sign
that
is
attached
to
it
i
always
use
the
word
imagine
because
i
think
that
everything
is
the
work
of
imagination
and
that
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
can
be
correctly
reduced
to
pure
imagination
in
which
they
all
consist
thus
judgment
reason
and
memory
are
not
absolute
parts
of
the
soul
but
merely
modifications
of
this
kind
of
medullary
screen
upon
which
images
of
the
objects
painted
in
the
eye
are
projected
as
by
a
magic
lantern
but
if
such
is
the
marvelous
and
incomprehensible
result
of
the
structure
of
the
brain
if
everything
is
perceived
and
explained
by
imagination
why
should
we
divide
the
sensitive
principle
which
thinks
in
man
is
not
this
a
clear
inconsistency
in
the
partisans
of
the
simplicity
of
the
mind
for
a
thing
that
is
divided
can
no
longer
without
absurdity
be
regarded
as
indivisible
see
to
what
one
is
brought
by
the
abuse
of
language
and
by
those
fine
words
spirituality
immateriality
etc
used
haphazard
and
not
understood
even
by
the
most
brilliant
nothing
is
easier
than
to
prove
a
system
based
as
this
one
is
on
the
intimate
feeling
and
personal
experience
of
each
individual
if
the
imagination
or
let
us
say
that
fantastic
part
of
the
brain
whose
nature
is
as
unknown
to
us
as
its
way
of
acting
be
naturally
small
or
weak
it
will
hardly
be
able
to
compare
the
analogy
or
the
resemblance
of
its
ideas
it
will
be
able
to
see
only
what
is
face
to
face
with
it
or
what
affects
it
very
strongly
and
how
will
it
see
all
this
yet
it
is
always
imagination
which
apperceives
and
imagination
which
represents
to
itself
all
objects
along
with
their
names
and
symbols
and
thus
once
again
imagination
is
the
soul
since
it
plays
all
the
rôles
of
the
soul
by
the
imagination
by
its
flattering
brush
the
cold
skeleton
of
reason
takes
on
living
and
ruddy
flesh
by
the
imagination
the
sciences
flourish
the
arts
are
adorned
the
wood
speaks
the
echoes
sigh
the
rocks
weep
marble
breathes
and
all
inanimate
objects
gain
life
it
is
imagination
again
which
adds
the
piquant
charm
of
voluptuousness
to
the
tenderness
of
an
amorous
heart
which
makes
tenderness
bud
in
the
study
of
the
philosopher
and
of
the
dusty
pedant
which
in
a
word
creates
scholars
as
well
as
orators
and
poets
foolishly
decried
by
some
vainly
praised
by
others
and
misunderstood
by
all
it
follows
not
only
in
the
train
of
the
graces
and
of
the
fine
arts
it
not
only
describes
but
can
also
measure
nature
it
reasons
judges
analyzes
compares
and
investigates
could
it
feel
so
keenly
the
beauties
of
the
pictures
drawn
for
it
unless
it
discovered
their
relations
no
just
as
it
can
not
turn
its
thoughts
on
the
pleasures
of
the
senses
without
enjoying
their
perfection
or
their
voluptuousness
it
can
not
reflect
on
what
it
has
mechanically
conceived
without
thus
being
judgment
itself
the
more
the
imagination
or
the
poorest
talent
is
exercised
the
more
it
gains
in
embonpoint
so
to
speak
and
the
larger
it
grows
it
becomes
sensitive
robust
broad
and
capable
of
thinking
the
best
of
organisms
has
need
of
this
exercise
man
preeminent
advantage
is
his
organism
in
vain
all
writers
of
books
on
morals
fail
to
regard
as
praiseworthy
those
qualities
that
come
by
nature
esteeming
only
the
talents
gained
by
dint
of
reflection
and
industry
for
whence
come
i
ask
skill
learning
and
virtue
if
not
from
a
disposition
that
makes
us
fit
to
become
skilful
wise
and
virtuous
and
whence
again
comes
this
disposition
if
not
from
nature
only
through
nature
do
we
have
any
good
qualities
to
her
we
owe
all
that
we
are
why
then
should
i
not
esteem
men
with
good
natural
qualities
as
much
as
men
who
shine
by
acquired
and
as
it
were
borrowed
virtues
whatever
the
virtue
may
be
from
whatever
source
it
may
come
it
is
worthy
of
esteem
the
only
question
is
how
to
estimate
it
mind
beauty
wealth
nobility
although
the
children
of
chance
all
have
their
own
value
as
skill
learning
and
virtue
have
theirs
those
upon
whom
nature
has
heaped
her
most
costly
gifts
should
pity
those
to
whom
these
gifts
have
been
refused
but
in
their
character
of
experts
they
may
feel
their
superiority
without
pride
a
beautiful
woman
would
be
as
foolish
to
think
herself
ugly
as
an
intelligent
man
to
think
himself
a
fool
an
exaggerated
modesty
a
rare
fault
to
be
sure
is
a
kind
of
ingratitude
towards
nature
an
honest
pride
on
the
contrary
is
the
mark
of
a
strong
and
beautiful
soul
revealed
by
manly
features
moulded
by
feeling
if
one
organism
is
an
advantage
and
the
preeminent
advantage
and
the
source
of
all
others
education
is
the
second
the
best
made
brain
would
be
a
total
loss
without
it
just
as
the
best
constituted
man
would
be
but
a
common
peasant
without
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
the
world
but
on
the
other
hand
what
would
be
the
use
of
the
most
excellent
school
without
a
matrix
perfectly
open
to
the
entrance
and
conception
of
ideas
it
is
impossible
to
impart
a
single
idea
to
a
man
deprived
of
all
his
senses
but
if
the
brain
is
at
the
same
time
well
organized
and
well
educated
it
is
a
fertile
soil
well
sown
that
brings
forth
a
hundredfold
what
it
has
received
or
to
leave
the
figures
of
speech
often
needed
to
express
what
one
means
and
to
add
grace
to
truth
itself
the
imagination
raised
by
art
to
the
rare
and
beautiful
dignity
of
genius
apprehends
exactly
all
the
relations
of
the
ideas
it
has
conceived
and
takes
in
easily
an
astounding
number
of
objects
in
order
to
deduce
from
them
a
long
chain
of
consequences
which
are
again
but
new
relations
produced
by
a
comparison
with
the
first
to
which
the
soul
finds
a
perfect
resemblance
such
is
i
think
the
generation
of
intelligence
i
say
finds
as
i
before
gave
the
epithet
apparent
to
the
likeness
of
objects
not
because
i
think
that
our
senses
are
always
deceivers
as
father
malebranche
has
claimed
or
that
our
eyes
naturally
a
little
unsteady
fail
to
see
objects
as
they
are
in
themselves
though
microscopes
prove
this
to
us
every
day
but
in
order
to
avoid
any
dispute
with
the
pyrrhonians
among
whom
bayle
is
well
known
i
say
of
truth
in
general
what
de
fontenelle
says
of
certain
truths
in
particular
that
we
must
sacrifice
it
in
order
to
remain
on
good
terms
with
society
and
it
accords
with
the
gentleness
of
my
character
to
avoid
all
disputes
unless
to
whet
conversation
the
cartesians
would
here
in
vain
make
an
onset
upon
me
with
their
innate
ideas
i
certainly
would
not
give
myself
a
quarter
of
the
trouble
that
locke
took
to
attack
such
chimeras
in
truth
what
is
the
use
of
writing
a
ponderous
volume
to
prove
a
doctrine
which
became
an
axiom
three
thousand
years
ago
according
to
the
principles
which
we
have
laid
down
and
which
we
consider
true
he
who
has
the
most
imagination
should
be
regarded
as
having
the
most
intelligence
or
genius
for
all
these
words
are
synonymous
and
again
only
by
a
shameful
abuse
of
terms
do
we
think
that
we
are
saying
different
things
when
we
are
merely
using
different
words
different
sounds
to
which
no
idea
or
real
distinction
is
attached
the
finest
greatest
or
strongest
imagination
is
then
the
one
most
suited
to
the
sciences
as
well
as
to
the
arts
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
whether
more
intellect
is
necessary
to
excel
in
the
art
of
aristotle
or
of
descartes
than
to
excel
in
that
of
euripides
or
of
sophocles
and
whether
nature
has
taken
more
trouble
to
make
newton
than
to
make
corneille
though
i
doubt
this
but
it
is
certain
that
imagination
alone
differently
applied
has
produced
their
diverse
triumphs
and
their
immortal
glory
if
one
is
known
as
having
little
judgment
and
much
imagination
this
means
that
the
imagination
has
been
left
too
much
alone
has
as
it
were
occupied
most
of
the
time
in
looking
at
itself
in
the
mirror
of
its
sensations
has
not
sufficiently
formed
the
habit
of
examining
the
sensations
themselves
attentively
it
means
that
the
imagination
has
been
more
impressed
by
images
than
by
their
truth
or
their
likeness
truly
so
quick
are
the
responses
of
the
imagination
that
if
attention
that
key
or
mother
of
the
sciences
does
not
do
its
part
imagination
can
do
little
more
than
run
over
and
skim
its
objects
see
that
bird
on
the
bough
it
seems
always
ready
to
fly
away
imagination
is
like
the
bird
always
carried
onward
by
the
turmoil
of
the
blood
and
the
animal
spirits
one
wave
leaves
a
mark
effaced
by
the
one
that
follows
the
soul
pursues
it
often
in
vain
it
must
expect
to
regret
the
loss
of
that
which
it
has
not
quickly
enough
seized
and
fixed
thus
imagination
the
true
image
of
time
is
being
ceaselessly
destroyed
and
renewed
such
is
the
chaos
and
the
continuous
quick
succession
of
our
ideas
they
drive
each
other
away
even
as
one
wave
yields
to
another
therefore
if
imagination
does
not
as
it
were
use
one
set
of
its
muscles
to
maintain
a
kind
of
equilibrium
with
the
fibres
of
the
brain
to
keep
its
attention
for
a
while
upon
an
object
that
is
on
the
point
of
disappearing
and
to
prevent
itself
from
contemplating
prematurely
another
object
unless
the
imagination
does
all
this
it
will
never
be
worthy
of
the
fine
name
of
judgment
it
will
express
vividly
what
it
has
perceived
in
the
same
fashion
it
will
create
orators
musicians
painters
poets
but
never
a
single
philosopher
on
the
contrary
if
the
imagination
be
trained
from
childhood
to
bridle
itself
and
to
keep
from
being
carried
away
by
its
own
impetuosity
an
impetuosity
which
creates
only
brilliant
enthusiasts
and
to
check
to
restrain
its
ideas
to
examine
them
in
all
their
aspects
in
order
to
see
all
sides
of
an
object
then
the
imagination
ready
in
judgment
will
comprehend
the
greatest
possible
sphere
of
objects
through
reasoning
and
its
vivacity
always
so
good
a
sign
in
children
and
only
needing
to
be
regulated
by
study
and
training
will
be
only
a
insight
without
which
little
progress
can
be
made
in
the
sciences
such
are
the
simple
foundations
upon
which
the
edifice
of
logic
has
been
reared
nature
has
built
these
foundations
for
the
whole
human
race
but
some
have
used
them
while
others
have
abused
them
in
spite
of
all
these
advantages
of
man
over
animals
it
is
doing
him
honor
to
place
him
in
the
same
class
for
truly
up
to
a
certain
age
he
is
more
of
an
animal
than
they
since
at
birth
he
has
less
instinct
what
animal
would
die
of
hunger
in
the
midst
of
a
river
of
milk
man
alone
like
that
child
of
olden
time
to
whom
a
modern
writer
refers
following
arnobius
he
knows
neither
the
foods
suitable
for
him
nor
the
water
that
can
drown
him
nor
the
fire
that
can
reduce
him
to
ashes
light
a
wax
candle
for
the
first
time
under
a
child
eyes
and
he
will
mechanically
put
his
fingers
in
the
flame
as
if
to
find
out
what
is
the
new
thing
that
he
sees
it
is
at
his
own
cost
that
he
will
learn
of
the
danger
but
he
will
not
be
caught
again
or
put
the
child
with
an
animal
on
a
precipice
the
child
alone
falls
off
he
drowns
where
the
animal
would
save
itself
by
swimming
at
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
the
child
knows
hardly
anything
of
the
great
pleasures
in
store
for
him
in
the
reproduction
of
his
species
when
he
is
a
youth
he
does
not
know
exactly
how
to
behave
in
a
game
which
nature
teaches
animals
so
quickly
he
hides
himself
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
taking
pleasure
and
of
having
been
made
to
be
happy
while
animals
frankly
glory
in
being
cynics
without
education
they
are
without
prejudices
for
one
more
example
let
us
observe
a
dog
and
a
child
who
have
lost
their
master
on
a
highway
the
child
cries
and
does
not
know
to
what
saint
to
pray
while
the
dog
better
helped
by
his
sense
of
smell
than
the
child
by
his
reason
soon
finds
his
master
thus
nature
made
us
to
be
lower
than
animals
or
at
least
to
exhibit
all
the
more
because
of
that
native
inferiority
the
wonderful
efficacy
of
education
which
alone
raises
us
from
the
level
of
the
animals
and
lifts
us
above
them
but
shall
we
grant
this
same
distinction
to
the
deaf
and
to
the
blind
to
imbeciles
madmen
or
savages
or
to
those
who
have
been
brought
up
in
the
woods
with
animals
to
those
who
have
lost
their
imagination
through
melancholia
or
in
short
to
all
those
animals
in
human
form
who
give
evidence
of
only
the
rudest
instinct
no
all
these
men
of
body
but
not
of
mind
do
not
deserve
to
be
classed
by
themselves
we
do
not
intend
to
hide
from
ourselves
the
arguments
that
can
be
brought
forward
against
our
belief
and
in
favor
of
a
primitive
distinction
between
men
and
animals
some
say
that
there
is
in
man
a
natural
law
a
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
which
has
never
been
imprinted
on
the
heart
of
animals
but
is
this
objection
or
rather
this
assertion
based
on
observation
any
assertion
unfounded
on
observation
may
be
rejected
by
a
philosopher
have
we
ever
had
a
single
experience
which
convinces
us
that
man
alone
has
been
enlightened
by
a
ray
denied
all
other
animals
if
there
is
no
such
experience
we
can
no
more
know
what
goes
on
in
animals
minds
or
even
in
the
minds
of
other
men
than
we
can
help
feeling
what
affects
the
inner
part
of
our
own
being
we
know
that
we
think
and
feel
remorse
an
intimate
feeling
forces
us
to
recognize
this
only
too
well
but
this
feeling
in
us
is
insufficient
to
enable
us
to
judge
the
remorse
of
others
that
is
why
we
have
to
take
others
at
their
word
or
judge
them
by
the
sensible
and
external
signs
we
have
noticed
in
ourselves
when
we
experienced
the
same
accusations
of
conscience
and
the
same
torments
in
order
to
decide
whether
animals
which
do
not
talk
have
received
the
natural
law
we
must
therefore
have
recourse
to
those
signs
to
which
i
have
just
referred
if
any
such
exist
the
facts
seem
to
prove
it
a
dog
that
bit
the
master
who
was
teasing
it
seemed
to
repent
a
minute
afterwards
it
looked
sad
ashamed
afraid
to
show
itself
and
seemed
to
confess
its
guilt
by
a
crouching
and
downcast
air
history
offers
us
a
famous
example
of
a
lion
which
would
not
devour
a
man
abandoned
to
its
fury
because
it
recognized
him
as
its
benefactor
how
much
might
it
be
wished
that
man
himself
always
showed
the
same
gratitude
for
kindnesses
and
the
same
respect
for
humanity
then
we
should
no
longer
fear
either
ungrateful
wretches
or
wars
which
are
the
plague
of
the
human
race
and
the
real
executioners
of
the
natural
law
but
a
being
to
which
nature
has
given
such
a
precocious
and
enlightened
instinct
which
judges
combines
reasons
and
deliberates
as
far
as
the
sphere
of
its
activity
extends
and
permits
a
being
which
feels
attachment
because
of
benefits
received
and
which
leaving
a
master
who
treats
it
badly
goes
to
seek
a
better
one
a
being
with
a
structure
like
ours
which
performs
the
same
acts
has
the
same
passions
the
same
griefs
the
same
pleasures
more
or
less
intense
according
to
the
sway
of
the
imagination
and
the
delicacy
of
the
nervous
organization
does
not
such
a
being
show
clearly
that
it
knows
its
faults
and
ours
understands
good
and
evil
and
in
a
word
has
consciousness
of
what
it
does
would
its
soul
which
feels
the
same
joys
the
same
mortification
and
the
same
discomfiture
which
we
feel
remain
utterly
unmoved
by
disgust
when
it
saw
a
torn
to
bits
or
when
it
had
itself
pitilessly
dismembered
this
if
this
be
granted
it
follows
that
the
precious
gift
now
in
question
would
not
have
been
denied
to
animals
for
since
they
show
us
sure
signs
of
repentance
as
well
as
of
intelligence
what
is
there
absurd
in
thinking
that
beings
almost
as
perfect
machines
as
ourselves
are
like
us
made
to
understand
and
to
feel
nature
let
no
one
object
that
animals
for
the
most
part
are
savage
beasts
incapable
of
realizing
the
evil
that
they
do
for
do
all
men
discriminate
better
between
vice
and
virtue
there
is
ferocity
in
our
species
as
well
as
in
theirs
men
who
are
in
the
barbarous
habit
of
breaking
the
natural
law
are
not
tormented
as
much
by
it
as
those
who
transgress
it
for
the
first
time
and
who
have
not
been
hardened
by
the
force
of
habit
the
same
thing
is
true
of
animals
as
of
men
both
may
be
more
or
less
ferocious
in
temperament
and
both
become
more
so
by
living
with
others
like
themselves
but
a
gentle
and
peaceful
animal
which
lives
among
other
animals
of
the
same
disposition
and
of
gentle
nurture
will
be
an
enemy
of
blood
and
carnage
it
will
blush
internally
at
having
shed
blood
there
is
perhaps
this
difference
that
since
among
animals
everything
is
sacrificed
to
their
needs
to
their
pleasures
to
the
necessities
of
life
which
they
enjoy
more
than
we
their
remorse
apparently
should
not
be
as
keen
as
ours
because
we
are
not
in
the
same
state
of
necessity
as
they
custom
perhaps
dulls
and
perhaps
stifles
remorse
as
well
as
pleasures
but
i
will
suppose
for
a
moment
that
i
am
utterly
mistaken
in
concluding
that
almost
all
the
world
holds
a
wrong
opinion
on
this
subject
while
i
alone
am
right
i
will
grant
that
animals
even
the
best
of
them
do
not
know
the
difference
between
moral
good
and
evil
that
they
have
no
recollection
of
the
trouble
taken
for
them
of
the
kindness
done
them
no
realization
of
their
own
virtues
i
will
suppose
for
instance
that
this
lion
to
which
i
like
so
many
others
have
referred
does
not
remember
at
all
that
it
refused
to
kill
the
man
abandoned
to
its
fury
in
a
combat
more
inhuman
than
one
could
find
among
lions
tigers
and
bears
put
together
for
our
compatriots
fight
swiss
against
swiss
brother
against
brother
recognize
each
other
and
yet
capture
and
kill
each
other
without
remorse
because
a
prince
pays
for
the
murder
i
suppose
in
short
that
the
natural
law
has
not
been
given
animals
what
will
be
the
consequences
of
this
supposition
man
is
not
moulded
from
a
costlier
clay
nature
has
used
but
one
dough
and
has
merely
varied
the
leaven
therefore
if
animals
do
not
repent
for
having
violated
this
inmost
feeling
which
i
am
discussing
or
rather
if
they
absolutely
lack
it
man
must
necessarily
be
in
the
same
condition
farewell
then
to
the
natural
law
and
all
the
fine
treatises
published
about
it
the
whole
animal
kingdom
in
general
would
be
deprived
of
it
but
conversely
if
man
can
not
dispense
with
the
belief
that
when
health
permits
him
to
be
himself
he
always
distinguishes
the
upright
humane
and
virtuous
from
those
who
are
not
humane
virtuous
nor
honorable
that
it
is
easy
to
tell
vice
from
virtue
by
the
unique
pleasure
and
the
peculiar
repugnance
that
seem
to
be
their
natural
effects
it
follows
that
animals
composed
of
the
same
matter
lacking
perhaps
only
one
degree
of
fermentation
to
make
it
exactly
like
man
must
share
the
same
prerogatives
of
animal
nature
and
that
thus
there
exists
no
soul
or
sensitive
substance
without
remorse
the
following
consideration
will
reinforce
these
observations
it
is
impossible
to
destroy
the
natural
law
the
impress
of
it
on
all
animals
is
so
strong
that
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
wildest
and
most
savage
have
some
moments
of
repentance
i
believe
that
that
cruel
maid
of
chalons
in
champagne
must
have
sorrowed
for
her
crime
if
she
really
ate
her
sister
i
think
that
the
same
thing
is
true
of
all
those
who
commit
crimes
even
involuntary
or
temperamental
crimes
true
of
gaston
of
orleans
who
could
not
help
stealing
of
a
certain
woman
who
was
subject
to
the
same
crime
when
pregnant
and
whose
children
inherited
it
of
the
woman
who
in
the
same
condition
ate
her
husband
of
that
other
woman
who
killed
her
children
salted
their
bodies
and
ate
a
piece
of
them
every
day
as
a
little
relish
of
that
daughter
of
a
thief
and
cannibal
who
at
twelve
years
followed
in
his
steps
although
she
had
been
orphaned
when
she
was
a
year
old
and
had
been
brought
up
by
honest
people
to
say
nothing
of
many
other
examples
of
which
the
records
of
our
observers
are
full
all
of
them
proving
that
there
are
a
thousand
hereditary
vices
and
virtues
which
are
transmitted
from
parents
to
children
as
those
of
the
foster
mother
pass
to
the
children
she
nurses
now
i
believe
and
admit
that
these
wretches
do
not
for
the
most
part
feel
at
the
time
the
enormity
of
their
actions
bulimia
or
canine
hunger
for
example
can
stifle
all
feeling
it
is
a
mania
of
the
stomach
that
one
is
compelled
to
satisfy
but
what
remorse
must
be
in
store
for
those
women
when
they
come
to
themselves
and
grow
sober
and
remember
the
crimes
they
have
committed
against
those
they
held
most
dear
what
a
punishment
for
an
involuntary
crime
which
they
could
not
resist
of
which
they
had
no
consciousness
whatever
however
this
is
apparently
not
enough
for
the
judges
for
of
these
women
of
whom
i
tell
one
was
cruelly
beaten
and
burned
and
another
was
buried
alive
i
realize
all
that
is
demanded
by
the
interest
of
society
but
doubtless
it
is
much
to
be
wished
that
excellent
physicians
might
be
the
only
judges
they
alone
could
tell
the
innocent
criminal
from
the
guilty
if
reason
is
the
slave
of
a
depraved
or
mad
desire
how
can
it
control
the
desire
but
if
crime
carries
with
it
its
own
more
or
less
cruel
punishment
if
the
most
continued
and
most
barbarous
habit
can
not
entirely
blot
out
repentance
in
the
crudest
hearts
if
criminals
are
lacerated
by
the
very
memory
of
their
deeds
why
should
we
frighten
the
imagination
of
weak
minds
by
a
hell
by
specters
and
by
precipices
of
fire
even
less
real
than
those
of
pascal
why
must
we
have
recourse
to
fables
as
an
honest
pope
once
said
himself
to
torment
even
the
unhappy
wretches
who
are
executed
because
we
do
not
think
that
they
are
sufficiently
punished
by
their
own
conscience
their
first
executioner
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
all
criminals
are
unjustly
punished
i
only
maintain
that
those
whose
will
is
depraved
and
whose
conscience
is
extinguished
are
punished
enough
by
their
remorse
when
they
come
to
themselves
a
remorse
i
venture
to
assert
from
which
nature
should
in
this
case
have
delivered
unhappy
souls
dragged
on
by
a
fatal
necessity
criminals
scoundrels
ingrates
those
in
short
without
natural
feelings
unhappy
tyrants
who
are
unworthy
of
life
in
vain
take
a
cruel
pleasure
in
their
barbarity
for
there
are
calm
moments
of
reflection
in
which
the
avenging
conscience
arises
testifies
against
them
and
condemns
them
to
be
almost
ceaselessly
torn
to
pieces
at
their
own
hands
whoever
torments
men
is
tormented
by
himself
and
the
sufferings
that
he
will
experience
will
be
the
just
measure
of
those
that
he
has
inflicted
on
the
other
hand
there
is
so
much
pleasure
in
doing
good
in
recognizing
and
appreciating
what
one
receives
so
much
satisfaction
in
practising
virtue
in
being
gentle
humane
kind
charitable
compassionate
and
generous
for
this
one
word
includes
all
the
virtues
that
i
consider
as
sufficiently
punished
any
one
who
is
unfortunate
enough
not
to
have
been
born
virtuous
we
were
not
originally
made
to
be
learned
we
have
become
so
perhaps
by
a
sort
of
abuse
of
our
organic
faculties
and
at
the
expense
of
the
state
which
nourishes
a
host
of
sluggards
whom
vanity
has
adorned
with
the
name
of
philosophers
nature
has
created
us
all
solely
to
be
happy
yes
all
of
us
from
the
crawling
worm
to
the
eagle
lost
in
the
clouds
for
this
cause
she
has
given
all
animals
some
share
of
natural
law
a
share
greater
or
less
according
to
the
needs
of
each
animal
organs
when
in
normal
condition
now
how
shall
we
define
natural
law
it
is
a
feeling
that
teaches
us
what
we
should
not
do
because
we
would
not
wish
it
to
be
done
to
us
should
i
dare
add
to
this
common
idea
that
this
feeling
seems
to
me
but
a
kind
of
fear
or
dread
as
salutary
to
the
race
as
to
the
individual
for
may
it
not
be
true
that
we
respect
the
purse
and
life
of
others
only
to
save
our
own
possessions
our
honor
and
ourselves
like
those
ixions
of
christianity
who
love
god
and
embrace
so
many
fantastic
virtues
merely
because
they
are
afraid
of
hell
you
see
that
natural
law
is
but
an
intimate
feeling
that
like
all
other
feelings
thought
included
belongs
also
to
imagination
evidently
therefore
natural
law
does
not
presuppose
education
revelation
nor
legislator
provided
one
does
not
propose
to
confuse
natural
law
with
civil
laws
in
the
ridiculous
fashion
of
the
theologians
the
arms
of
fanaticism
may
destroy
those
who
support
these
truths
but
they
will
never
destroy
the
truths
themselves
i
do
not
mean
to
call
in
question
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
me
that
the
greatest
degree
of
probability
is
in
favor
of
this
belief
but
since
the
existence
of
this
being
goes
no
further
than
that
of
any
other
toward
proving
the
need
of
worship
it
is
a
theoretic
truth
with
very
little
practical
value
therefore
since
we
may
say
after
such
long
experience
that
religion
does
not
imply
exact
honesty
we
are
authorized
by
the
same
reasons
to
think
that
atheism
does
not
exclude
it
furthermore
who
can
be
sure
that
the
reason
for
man
existence
is
not
simply
the
fact
that
he
exists
perhaps
he
was
thrown
by
chance
on
some
spot
on
the
earth
surface
nobody
knows
how
nor
why
but
simply
that
he
must
live
and
die
like
the
mushrooms
which
appear
from
day
to
day
or
like
those
flowers
which
border
the
ditches
and
cover
the
walls
let
us
not
lose
ourselves
in
the
infinite
for
we
are
not
made
to
have
the
least
idea
thereof
and
are
absolutely
unable
to
get
back
to
the
origin
of
things
besides
it
does
not
matter
for
our
peace
of
mind
whether
matter
be
eternal
or
have
been
created
whether
there
be
or
be
not
a
god
how
foolish
to
torment
ourselves
so
much
about
things
which
we
can
not
know
and
which
would
not
make
us
any
happier
even
were
we
to
gain
knowledge
about
them
but
some
will
say
read
all
such
works
as
those
of
fénelon
of
nieuwentyt
of
abadie
of
derham
of
rais
and
the
rest
well
what
will
they
teach
me
or
rather
what
have
they
taught
me
they
are
only
tiresome
repetitions
of
zealous
writers
one
of
whom
adds
to
the
other
only
verbiage
more
likely
to
strengthen
than
to
undermine
the
foundations
of
atheism
the
number
of
the
evidences
drawn
from
the
spectacle
of
nature
does
not
give
these
evidences
any
more
force
either
the
mere
structure
of
a
finger
of
an
ear
of
an
eye
a
single
observation
of
malpighi
proves
all
and
doubtless
much
better
than
descartes
and
malebranche
proved
it
or
all
the
other
evidences
prove
nothing
deists
and
even
christians
should
therefore
be
content
to
point
out
that
throughout
the
animal
kingdom
the
same
aims
are
pursued
and
accomplished
by
an
infinite
number
of
different
mechanisms
all
of
them
however
exactly
geometrical
for
what
stronger
weapons
could
there
be
with
which
to
overthrow
atheists
it
is
true
that
if
my
reason
does
not
deceive
me
man
and
the
whole
universe
seem
to
have
been
designed
for
this
unity
of
aim
the
sun
air
water
the
organism
the
shape
of
bodies
everything
is
brought
to
a
focus
in
the
eye
as
in
a
mirror
that
faithfully
presents
to
the
imagination
all
the
objects
reflected
in
it
in
accordance
with
the
laws
required
by
the
infinite
variety
of
bodies
which
take
part
in
vision
in
ears
we
find
everywhere
a
striking
variety
and
yet
the
difference
of
structure
in
men
animals
birds
and
fishes
does
not
produce
different
uses
all
ears
are
so
mathematically
made
that
they
tend
equally
to
one
and
the
same
end
namely
hearing
but
would
chance
the
deist
asks
be
a
great
enough
geometrician
to
vary
thus
at
pleasure
the
works
of
which
she
is
supposed
to
be
the
author
without
being
hindered
by
so
great
a
diversity
from
gaining
the
same
end
again
the
deist
will
bring
forward
as
a
difficulty
those
parts
of
the
animal
that
are
clearly
contained
in
it
for
future
use
the
butterfly
in
the
caterpillar
man
in
the
sperm
a
whole
polyp
in
each
of
its
parts
the
valvule
in
the
oval
orifice
the
lungs
in
the
foetus
the
teeth
in
their
sockets
the
bones
in
the
fluid
from
which
they
detach
themselves
and
in
an
incomprehensible
manner
harden
and
since
the
partisans
of
this
theory
far
from
neglecting
anything
that
would
strengthen
it
never
tire
of
piling
up
proof
upon
proof
they
are
willing
to
avail
themselves
of
everything
even
of
the
weakness
of
the
mind
in
certain
cases
look
they
say
at
men
like
spinoza
vanini
desbarreau
and
boindin
apostles
who
honor
deism
more
than
they
harm
it
the
duration
of
their
health
was
the
measure
of
their
unbelief
and
one
rarely
fails
they
add
to
renounce
atheism
when
the
passions
with
their
instrument
the
body
have
grown
weak
that
is
certainly
the
most
that
can
be
said
in
favor
of
the
existence
of
god
although
the
last
argument
is
frivolous
in
that
these
conversions
are
short
and
the
mind
almost
always
regains
its
former
opinions
and
acts
accordingly
as
soon
as
it
has
regained
or
rather
rediscovered
its
strength
in
that
of
the
body
that
is
at
least
much
more
than
was
said
by
the
physician
diderot
in
his
pensées
philosophiques
a
sublime
work
that
will
not
convince
a
single
atheist
what
reply
can
in
truth
be
made
to
a
man
who
says
we
do
not
know
nature
causes
hidden
in
her
breast
might
have
produced
everything
in
your
turn
observe
the
polyp
of
trembley
does
it
not
contain
in
itself
the
causes
which
bring
about
regeneration
why
then
would
it
be
absurd
to
think
that
there
are
physical
causes
by
reason
of
which
everything
has
been
made
and
to
which
the
whole
chain
of
this
vast
universe
is
so
necessarily
bound
and
held
that
nothing
which
happens
could
have
failed
to
happen
causes
of
which
we
are
so
invincibly
ignorant
that
we
have
had
recourse
to
a
god
who
as
some
aver
is
not
so
much
as
a
logical
entity
thus
to
destroy
chance
is
not
to
prove
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being
since
there
may
be
some
other
thing
which
is
neither
chance
nor
god
i
mean
nature
it
follows
that
the
study
of
nature
can
make
only
unbelievers
and
the
way
of
thinking
of
all
its
more
successful
investigators
proves
this
the
weight
of
the
universe
therefore
far
from
crushing
a
real
atheist
does
not
even
shake
him
all
these
evidences
of
a
creator
repeated
thousands
and
thousands
of
times
evidences
that
are
placed
far
above
the
comprehension
of
men
like
us
are
however
far
one
push
the
argument
only
to
the
or
to
those
who
have
enough
confidence
in
their
reason
to
believe
themselves
capable
of
judging
on
the
basis
of
certain
phenomena
against
which
as
you
see
the
atheists
can
urge
others
perhaps
equally
strong
and
absolutely
opposed
for
if
we
listen
to
the
naturalists
again
they
will
tell
us
that
the
very
causes
which
in
a
chemist
hands
by
a
chance
combination
made
the
first
mirror
in
the
hands
of
nature
made
the
pure
water
the
mirror
of
the
simple
shepherdess
that
the
motion
which
keeps
the
world
going
could
have
created
it
that
each
body
has
taken
the
place
assigned
to
it
by
its
own
nature
that
the
air
must
have
surrounded
the
earth
and
that
iron
and
the
other
metals
are
produced
by
internal
motions
of
the
earth
for
one
and
the
same
reason
that
the
sun
is
as
much
a
natural
product
as
electricity
that
it
was
not
made
to
warm
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
whom
it
sometimes
burns
any
more
than
the
rain
was
made
to
make
the
seeds
grow
which
it
often
spoils
that
the
mirror
and
the
water
were
no
more
made
for
people
to
see
themselves
in
than
were
all
other
polished
bodies
with
this
same
property
that
the
eye
is
in
truth
a
kind
of
glass
in
which
the
soul
can
contemplate
the
image
of
objects
as
they
are
presented
to
it
by
these
bodies
but
that
it
is
not
proved
that
this
organ
was
really
made
expressly
for
this
contemplation
nor
purposely
placed
in
its
socket
and
in
short
that
it
may
well
be
that
lucretius
the
physician
lamy
and
all
epicureans
both
ancient
and
modern
were
right
when
they
suggested
that
the
eye
sees
only
because
it
is
formed
and
placed
as
it
is
and
that
given
once
for
all
the
same
rules
of
motion
followed
by
nature
in
the
generation
and
development
of
bodies
this
marvelous
organ
could
not
have
been
formed
and
placed
differently
such
is
the
pro
and
the
con
and
the
summary
of
those
fine
arguments
that
will
eternally
divide
the
philosophers
i
do
not
take
either
side
non
nostrum
inter
vos
tantas
componere
lites
this
is
what
i
said
to
one
of
my
friends
a
frenchman
as
frank
a
pyrronian
as
i
a
man
of
much
merit
and
worthy
of
a
better
fate
he
gave
me
a
very
singular
answer
in
regard
to
the
matter
it
is
true
he
told
me
that
the
pro
and
con
should
not
disturb
at
all
the
soul
of
a
philosopher
who
sees
that
nothing
is
proved
with
clearness
enough
to
force
his
consent
and
that
the
arguments
offered
on
one
side
are
neutralized
by
those
of
the
other
however
he
continued
the
universe
will
never
be
happy
unless
it
is
atheistic
here
are
this
wretch
reasons
if
atheism
said
he
were
generally
accepted
all
the
forms
of
religion
would
then
be
destroyed
and
cut
off
at
the
roots
no
more
theological
wars
no
more
soldiers
of
religion
such
terrible
soldiers
nature
infected
with
a
sacred
poison
would
regain
its
rights
and
its
purity
deaf
to
all
other
voices
tranquil
mortals
would
follow
only
the
spontaneous
dictates
of
their
own
being
the
only
commands
which
can
never
be
despised
with
impunity
and
which
alone
can
lead
us
to
happiness
through
the
pleasant
paths
of
virtue
such
is
natural
law
whoever
rigidly
observes
it
is
a
good
man
and
deserves
the
confidence
of
all
the
human
race
whoever
fails
to
follow
it
scrupulously
affects
in
vain
the
specious
exterior
of
another
religion
he
is
a
scamp
or
a
hypocrite
whom
i
distrust
after
this
let
a
vain
people
think
otherwise
let
them
dare
affirm
that
even
probity
is
at
stake
in
not
believing
in
revelation
in
a
word
that
another
religion
than
that
of
nature
is
necessary
whatever
it
may
be
such
an
assertion
is
wretched
and
pitiable
and
so
is
the
good
opinion
which
each
one
gives
us
of
the
religion
he
has
embraced
we
do
not
seek
here
the
votes
of
the
crowd
whoever
raises
in
his
heart
altars
to
superstition
is
born
to
worship
idols
and
not
to
thrill
to
virtue
but
since
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
depend
to
such
a
degree
on
the
proper
organization
of
the
brain
and
of
the
whole
body
that
apparently
they
are
but
this
organization
itself
the
soul
is
clearly
an
enlightened
machine
for
finally
even
if
man
alone
had
received
a
share
of
natural
law
would
he
be
any
less
a
machine
for
that
a
few
more
wheels
a
few
more
springs
than
in
the
most
perfect
animals
the
brain
proportionally
nearer
the
heart
and
for
this
very
reason
receiving
more
blood
any
one
of
a
number
of
unknown
causes
might
always
produce
this
delicate
conscience
so
easily
wounded
this
remorse
which
is
no
more
foreign
to
matter
than
to
thought
and
in
a
word
all
the
differences
that
are
supposed
to
exist
here
could
the
organism
then
suffice
for
everything
once
more
yes
since
thought
visibly
develops
with
our
organs
why
should
not
the
matter
of
which
they
are
composed
be
susceptible
of
remorse
also
when
once
it
has
acquired
with
time
the
faculty
of
feeling
the
soul
is
therefore
but
an
empty
word
of
which
no
one
has
any
idea
and
which
an
enlightened
man
should
use
only
to
signify
the
part
in
us
that
thinks
given
the
least
principle
of
motion
animated
bodies
will
have
all
that
is
necessary
for
moving
feeling
thinking
repenting
or
in
a
word
for
conducting
themselves
in
the
physical
realm
and
in
the
moral
realm
which
depends
upon
it
yet
we
take
nothing
for
granted
those
who
perhaps
think
that
all
the
difficulties
have
not
yet
been
removed
shall
now
read
of
experiments
that
will
completely
satisfy
them
the
flesh
of
all
animals
palpitates
after
death
this
palpitation
continues
longer
the
more
cold
blooded
the
animal
is
and
the
less
it
perspires
tortoises
lizards
serpents
etc
are
evidence
of
this
muscles
separated
from
the
body
contract
when
they
are
stimulated
the
intestines
keep
up
their
peristaltic
or
vermicular
motion
for
a
long
time
according
to
cowper
a
simple
injection
of
hot
water
reanimates
the
heart
and
the
muscles
a
frog
heart
moves
for
an
hour
or
more
after
it
has
been
removed
from
the
body
especially
when
exposed
to
the
sun
or
better
still
when
placed
on
a
hot
table
or
chair
if
this
movement
seems
totally
lost
one
has
only
to
stimulate
the
heart
and
that
hollow
muscle
beats
again
harvey
made
this
same
observation
on
toads
bacon
of
verulam
in
his
treatise
sylva
sylvarum
cites
the
case
of
a
man
convicted
of
treason
who
was
opened
alive
and
whose
heart
thrown
into
hot
water
leaped
several
times
each
time
less
high
to
the
perpendicular
height
of
two
feet
take
a
tiny
chicken
still
in
the
egg
cut
out
the
heart
and
you
will
observe
the
same
phenomena
as
before
under
almost
the
same
conditions
the
warmth
of
the
breath
alone
reanimates
an
animal
about
to
perish
in
the
air
pump
the
same
experiments
which
we
owe
to
boyle
and
to
sténon
are
made
on
pigeons
dogs
and
rabbits
pieces
of
their
hearts
beat
as
their
whole
hearts
would
the
same
movements
can
be
seen
in
paws
that
have
been
cut
off
from
moles
the
caterpillar
the
worm
the
spider
the
fly
the
eel
all
exhibit
the
same
phenomena
and
in
hot
water
because
of
the
fire
it
contains
the
movement
of
the
detached
parts
increases
a
drunken
soldier
cut
off
with
one
stroke
of
his
sabre
an
indian
rooster
head
the
animal
remained
standing
then
walked
and
ran
happening
to
run
against
a
wall
it
turned
around
beat
its
wings
still
running
and
finally
fell
down
as
it
lay
on
the
ground
all
the
muscles
of
this
rooster
kept
on
moving
that
is
what
i
saw
myself
and
almost
the
same
phenomena
can
easily
be
observed
in
kittens
or
puppies
with
their
heads
cut
off
polyps
do
more
than
move
after
they
have
been
cut
in
pieces
in
a
week
they
regenerate
to
form
as
many
animals
as
there
are
pieces
i
am
sorry
that
these
facts
speak
against
the
naturalists
system
of
generation
or
rather
i
am
very
glad
of
it
for
let
this
discovery
teach
us
never
to
reach
a
general
conclusion
even
on
the
ground
of
all
known
and
most
decisive
experiments
here
we
have
many
more
facts
than
are
needed
to
prove
in
an
incontestable
way
that
each
tiny
fibre
or
part
of
an
organized
body
moves
by
a
principle
which
belongs
to
it
its
activity
unlike
voluntary
motions
does
not
depend
in
any
way
on
the
nerves
since
the
movements
in
question
occur
in
parts
of
the
body
which
have
no
connection
with
the
circulation
but
if
this
force
is
manifested
even
in
sections
of
fibres
the
heart
which
is
a
composite
of
peculiarly
connected
fibres
must
possess
the
same
property
i
did
not
need
bacon
story
to
persuade
me
of
this
it
was
easy
for
me
to
come
to
this
conclusion
both
from
the
perfect
analogy
of
the
structure
of
the
human
heart
with
that
of
animals
and
also
from
the
very
bulk
of
the
human
heart
in
which
this
movement
escapes
our
eyes
only
because
it
is
smothered
and
finally
because
in
corpses
all
the
organs
are
cold
and
lifeless
if
executed
criminals
were
dissected
while
their
bodies
are
still
warm
we
should
probably
see
in
their
hearts
the
same
movements
that
are
observed
in
the
of
those
that
have
been
beheaded
the
motive
principle
of
the
whole
body
and
even
of
its
parts
cut
in
pieces
is
such
that
it
produces
not
irregular
movements
as
some
have
thought
but
very
regular
ones
in
warm
blooded
and
perfect
animals
as
well
as
in
cold
and
imperfect
ones
no
resource
therefore
remains
open
to
our
adversaries
but
to
deny
thousands
and
thousands
of
facts
which
every
man
can
easily
verify
if
now
any
one
ask
me
where
is
this
innate
force
in
our
bodies
i
answer
that
it
very
clearly
resides
in
what
the
ancients
called
the
parenchyma
that
is
to
say
in
the
very
substance
of
the
organs
not
including
the
veins
the
arteries
the
nerves
in
a
word
that
it
resides
in
the
organization
of
the
whole
body
and
that
consequently
each
organ
contains
within
itself
forces
more
or
less
active
according
to
the
need
of
them
let
us
now
go
into
some
detail
concerning
these
springs
of
the
human
machine
all
the
vital
animal
natural
and
automatic
motions
are
carried
on
by
their
action
is
it
not
in
a
purely
mechanical
way
that
the
body
shrinks
back
when
it
is
struck
with
terror
at
the
sight
of
an
unforeseen
precipice
that
the
eyelids
are
lowered
at
the
menace
of
a
blow
as
some
have
remarked
and
that
the
pupil
contracts
in
broad
daylight
to
save
the
retina
and
dilates
to
see
objects
in
darkness
is
it
not
by
mechanical
means
that
the
pores
of
the
skin
close
in
winter
so
that
the
cold
can
not
penetrate
to
the
interior
of
the
blood
vessels
and
that
the
stomach
vomits
when
it
is
irritated
by
poison
by
a
certain
quantity
of
opium
and
by
all
emetics
that
the
heart
the
arteries
and
the
muscles
contract
in
sleep
as
well
as
in
waking
hours
that
the
lungs
serve
as
bellows
continually
in
exercise
that
the
heart
contracts
more
strongly
than
any
other
muscle
i
shall
not
go
into
any
more
detail
concerning
all
these
little
subordinate
forces
well
known
to
all
but
there
is
another
more
subtle
and
marvelous
force
which
animates
them
all
it
is
the
source
of
all
our
feelings
of
all
our
pleasures
of
all
our
passions
and
of
all
our
thoughts
for
the
brain
has
its
muscles
for
thinking
as
the
legs
have
muscles
for
walking
i
wish
to
speak
of
this
impetuous
principle
that
hippocrates
calls
enormôn
soul
this
principle
exists
and
has
its
seat
in
the
brain
at
the
origin
of
the
nerves
by
which
it
exercises
its
control
over
all
the
rest
of
the
body
by
this
fact
is
explained
all
that
can
be
explained
even
to
the
surprising
effects
of
maladies
of
the
imagination
look
at
the
portrait
of
the
famous
pope
who
is
to
say
the
least
the
voltaire
of
the
english
the
effort
the
energy
of
his
genius
are
imprinted
upon
his
countenance
it
is
convulsed
his
eyes
protrude
from
their
sockets
the
eyebrows
are
raised
with
the
muscles
of
the
forehead
why
because
the
brain
is
in
travail
and
all
the
body
must
share
in
such
a
laborious
deliverance
if
there
were
not
an
internal
cord
which
pulled
the
external
ones
whence
would
come
all
these
phenomena
to
admit
a
soul
as
explanation
of
them
is
to
be
reduced
to
explaining
phenomena
by
the
operations
of
the
holy
spirit
in
fact
if
what
thinks
in
my
brain
is
not
a
part
of
this
organ
and
therefore
of
the
whole
body
why
does
my
blood
boil
and
the
fever
of
my
mind
pass
into
my
veins
when
lying
quietly
in
bed
i
am
forming
the
plan
of
some
work
or
carrying
on
an
abstract
calculation
put
this
question
to
men
of
imagination
to
great
poets
to
men
who
are
enraptured
by
the
felicitous
expression
of
sentiment
and
transported
by
an
exquisite
fancy
or
by
the
charms
of
nature
of
truth
or
of
virtue
by
their
enthusiasm
by
what
they
will
tell
you
they
have
experienced
you
will
judge
the
cause
by
its
effects
by
that
harmony
which
borelli
a
mere
anatomist
understood
better
than
all
the
leibnizians
you
will
comprehend
the
material
unity
of
man
in
short
if
the
which
causes
pain
occasions
also
the
fever
by
which
the
distracted
mind
loses
its
and
if
conversely
the
mind
too
much
excited
disturbs
the
body
and
kindles
that
inner
fire
which
killed
bayle
while
he
was
still
so
young
if
an
agitation
rouses
my
desire
and
my
ardent
wish
for
what
a
moment
ago
i
cared
nothing
about
and
if
in
their
turn
certain
brain
impressions
excite
the
same
longing
and
the
same
desires
then
why
should
we
regard
as
double
what
is
manifestly
one
being
in
vain
you
fall
back
on
the
power
of
the
will
since
for
one
order
that
the
will
gives
it
bows
a
hundred
times
to
the
yoke
and
what
wonder
that
in
health
the
body
obeys
since
a
torrent
of
blood
and
of
animal
spirits
forces
its
obedience
and
since
the
will
has
as
ministers
an
invisible
legion
of
fluids
swifter
than
lightning
and
ever
ready
to
do
its
bidding
but
as
the
power
of
the
will
is
exercised
by
means
of
the
nerves
it
is
likewise
limited
by
them
does
the
result
of
jaundice
surprise
you
do
you
not
know
that
the
color
of
bodies
depends
on
the
color
of
the
glasses
through
which
we
look
at
them
and
that
whatever
is
the
color
of
the
humors
such
is
the
color
of
objects
at
least
for
us
vain
playthings
of
a
thousand
illusions
but
remove
this
color
from
the
aqueous
humor
of
the
eye
let
the
bile
flow
through
its
natural
filter
then
the
soul
having
new
eyes
will
no
longer
see
yellow
again
is
it
not
thus
by
removing
cataract
or
by
injecting
the
eustachian
canal
that
sight
is
restored
to
the
blind
or
hearing
to
the
deaf
how
many
people
who
were
perhaps
only
clever
charlatans
passed
for
miracle
workers
in
the
dark
ages
beautiful
the
soul
and
powerful
the
will
which
can
not
act
save
by
permission
of
the
bodily
conditions
and
whose
tastes
change
with
age
and
fever
should
we
then
be
astonished
that
philosophers
have
always
had
in
mind
the
health
of
the
body
to
preserve
the
health
of
the
soul
that
pythagoras
gave
rules
for
the
diet
as
carefully
as
plato
forbade
wine
the
regime
suited
to
the
body
is
always
the
one
with
which
sane
physicians
think
they
must
begin
when
it
is
a
question
of
forming
the
mind
and
of
instructing
it
in
the
knowledge
of
truth
and
virtue
but
these
are
vain
words
in
the
disorder
of
illness
and
in
the
tumult
of
the
senses
without
the
precepts
of
hygiene
epictetus
socrates
plato
and
the
rest
preach
in
vain
all
ethics
is
fruitless
for
one
who
lacks
his
share
of
temperance
it
is
the
source
of
all
virtues
as
intemperance
is
the
source
of
all
vices
is
more
needed
for
why
lose
myself
in
discussion
of
the
passions
which
are
all
explained
by
the
term
enormôn
of
hippocrates
to
prove
that
man
is
but
an
animal
or
a
collection
of
springs
which
wind
each
other
up
without
our
being
able
to
tell
at
what
point
in
this
human
circle
nature
has
begun
if
these
springs
differ
among
themselves
these
differences
consist
only
in
their
position
and
in
their
degrees
of
strength
and
never
in
their
nature
wherefore
the
soul
is
but
a
principle
of
motion
or
a
material
and
sensible
part
of
the
brain
which
can
be
regarded
without
fear
of
error
as
the
mainspring
of
the
whole
machine
having
a
visible
influence
on
all
the
parts
the
soul
seems
even
to
have
been
made
for
the
brain
so
that
all
the
other
parts
of
the
system
are
but
a
kind
of
emanation
from
the
brain
this
will
appear
from
certain
observations
made
on
different
embryos
which
i
shall
now
enumerate
this
oscillation
which
is
natural
or
suited
to
our
machine
and
with
which
each
fibre
and
even
each
fibrous
element
so
to
speak
seems
to
be
endowed
like
that
of
a
pendulum
can
not
keep
up
forever
it
must
be
renewed
as
it
loses
strength
invigorated
when
it
is
tired
and
weakened
when
it
is
disturbed
by
excess
of
strength
and
vigor
in
this
alone
true
medicine
consists
the
body
is
but
a
watch
whose
watchmaker
is
the
new
chyle
first
care
when
the
chyle
enters
the
blood
is
to
excite
in
it
a
kind
of
fever
which
the
chemists
who
dream
only
of
retorts
must
have
taken
for
fermentation
this
fever
produces
a
greater
filtration
of
spirits
which
mechanically
animate
the
muscles
and
the
heart
as
if
they
had
been
sent
there
by
order
of
the
will
these
then
are
the
causes
or
the
forces
of
life
which
thus
sustain
for
a
hundred
years
that
perpetual
movement
of
the
solids
and
the
liquids
which
is
as
necessary
to
the
first
as
to
the
second
but
who
can
say
whether
the
solids
contribute
more
than
the
fluids
to
this
movement
or
vice
versa
all
that
we
know
is
that
the
action
of
the
former
would
soon
cease
without
the
help
of
the
latter
that
is
without
the
help
of
the
fluids
which
by
their
onset
rouse
and
maintain
the
elasticity
of
the
blood
vessels
on
which
their
own
circulation
depends
from
this
it
follows
that
after
death
the
natural
resilience
of
each
substance
is
still
more
or
less
strong
according
to
the
remnants
of
life
which
it
outlives
being
the
last
to
perish
so
true
is
it
that
this
force
of
the
animal
parts
can
be
preserved
and
strengthened
by
that
of
the
circulation
but
that
it
does
not
depend
on
the
strength
of
the
circulation
since
as
we
have
seen
it
can
dispense
with
even
the
integrity
of
each
member
or
organ
i
am
aware
that
this
opinion
has
not
been
relished
by
all
scholars
and
that
stahl
especially
had
much
scorn
for
it
this
great
chemist
has
wished
to
persuade
us
that
the
soul
is
the
sole
cause
of
all
our
movements
but
this
is
to
speak
as
a
fanatic
and
not
as
a
philosopher
to
destroy
the
hypothesis
of
stahl
we
need
not
make
as
great
an
effort
as
i
find
that
others
have
done
before
me
we
need
only
glance
at
a
violinist
what
flexibility
what
lightness
in
his
fingers
the
movements
are
so
quick
that
it
seems
almost
as
if
there
were
no
succession
but
i
pray
or
rather
i
challenge
the
followers
of
stahl
who
understand
so
perfectly
all
that
our
soul
can
do
to
tell
me
how
it
could
possibly
execute
so
many
motions
so
quickly
motions
moreover
which
take
place
so
far
from
the
soul
and
in
so
many
different
places
that
is
to
suppose
that
a
flute
player
could
play
brilliant
cadences
on
an
infinite
number
of
holes
that
he
could
not
know
and
on
which
he
could
not
even
put
his
finger
but
let
us
say
with
hecquet
that
all
men
may
not
go
to
corinth
why
should
not
stahl
have
been
even
more
favored
by
nature
as
a
man
than
as
a
chemist
and
a
practitioner
happy
mortal
he
must
have
received
a
soul
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
mankind
a
sovereign
soul
which
not
content
with
having
some
control
over
the
voluntary
muscles
easily
held
the
reins
of
all
the
movements
of
the
body
and
could
suspend
them
calm
them
or
excite
them
at
its
pleasure
with
so
despotic
a
mistress
in
whose
hands
were
in
a
sense
the
beating
of
the
heart
and
the
laws
of
circulation
there
could
certainly
be
no
fever
no
pain
no
weariness
the
soul
wills
and
the
springs
play
contract
or
relax
but
how
did
the
springs
of
stahl
machine
get
out
of
order
so
soon
he
who
has
in
himself
so
great
a
doctor
should
be
immortal
moreover
stahl
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
rejected
the
principle
of
the
vibration
of
organic
bodies
greater
minds
have
not
used
the
principle
when
they
wished
to
explain
the
action
of
the
heart
etc
one
need
only
read
the
institutions
of
medicine
by
boerhaave
to
see
what
laborious
and
enticing
systems
this
great
man
was
obliged
to
invent
by
the
labor
of
his
mighty
genius
through
failure
to
admit
that
there
is
so
wonderful
a
force
in
all
bodies
willis
and
perrault
minds
of
a
more
feeble
stamp
but
careful
observers
of
nature
whereas
nature
was
known
to
the
famous
leyden
professor
only
through
others
and
second
hand
so
to
speak
seem
to
have
preferred
to
suppose
a
soul
generally
extended
over
the
whole
body
instead
of
the
principle
which
we
are
describing
but
according
to
this
hypothesis
which
was
the
hypothesis
of
vergil
and
of
all
epicureans
an
hypothesis
which
the
history
of
the
polyp
might
seem
at
first
sight
to
favor
the
movements
which
go
on
after
the
death
of
the
subject
in
which
they
inhere
are
due
to
a
remnant
of
soul
still
maintained
by
the
parts
that
contract
though
from
the
moment
of
death
these
are
not
excited
by
the
blood
and
the
spirits
whence
it
may
be
seen
that
these
writers
whose
solid
works
easily
eclipse
all
philosophic
fables
are
deceived
only
in
the
manner
of
those
who
have
endowed
matter
with
the
faculty
of
thinking
i
mean
to
say
by
having
expressed
themselves
badly
in
obscure
and
meaningless
terms
in
truth
what
is
this
remnant
of
a
soul
if
it
is
not
the
moving
force
of
the
leibnizians
badly
rendered
by
such
an
expression
which
however
perrault
in
particular
has
really
foreseen
see
his
treatise
on
the
mechanism
of
animals
now
that
it
is
clearly
proved
against
the
cartesians
the
followers
of
stahl
the
malebranchists
and
the
theologians
who
little
deserve
to
be
mentioned
here
that
matter
is
not
only
when
organized
as
in
a
whole
heart
for
example
but
even
when
this
organization
has
been
destroyed
human
curiosity
would
like
to
discover
how
a
body
by
the
fact
that
it
is
originally
endowed
with
the
breath
of
life
finds
itself
adorned
in
consequence
with
the
faculty
of
feeling
and
thus
with
that
of
thought
and
heavens
what
efforts
have
not
been
made
by
certain
philosophers
to
manage
to
prove
this
and
what
nonsense
on
this
subject
i
have
had
the
patience
to
read
all
that
experience
teaches
us
is
that
while
movement
persists
however
slight
it
may
be
in
one
or
more
fibres
we
need
only
stimulate
them
to
and
animate
this
movement
almost
extinguished
this
has
been
shown
in
the
host
of
experiments
with
which
i
have
undertaken
to
crush
the
systems
it
is
therefore
certain
that
motion
and
feeling
excite
each
other
in
turn
both
in
a
whole
body
and
in
the
same
body
when
its
structure
is
destroyed
to
say
nothing
of
certain
plants
which
seem
to
exhibit
the
same
phenomena
of
the
union
of
feeling
and
motion
but
furthermore
how
many
excellent
philosophers
have
shown
that
thought
is
but
a
faculty
of
feeling
and
that
the
reasonable
soul
is
but
the
feeling
soul
engaged
in
contemplating
its
ideas
and
in
reasoning
this
would
be
proved
by
the
fact
alone
that
when
feeling
is
stifled
thought
also
is
checked
for
instance
in
apoplexy
in
lethargy
in
catalepsis
etc
for
it
is
ridiculous
to
suggest
that
during
these
stupors
the
soul
keeps
on
thinking
even
though
it
does
not
remember
the
ideas
that
it
has
had
as
to
the
development
of
feeling
and
motion
it
is
absurd
to
waste
time
seeking
for
its
mechanism
the
nature
of
motion
is
as
unknown
to
us
as
that
of
matter
how
can
we
discover
how
it
is
produced
unless
like
the
author
of
the
history
of
the
soul
we
resuscitate
the
old
and
unintelligible
doctrine
of
substantial
forms
i
am
then
quite
as
content
not
to
know
how
inert
and
simple
matter
becomes
active
and
highly
organized
as
not
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
sun
without
red
glasses
and
i
am
as
little
disquieted
concerning
the
other
incomprehensible
wonders
of
nature
the
production
of
feeling
and
of
thought
in
a
being
which
earlier
appeared
to
our
limited
eyes
as
a
mere
clod
of
clay
grant
only
that
organized
matter
is
endowed
with
a
principle
of
motion
which
alone
differentiates
it
from
the
inorganic
and
can
one
deny
this
in
the
face
of
the
most
incontestable
observation
and
that
among
animals
as
i
have
sufficiently
proved
everything
depends
upon
the
diversity
of
this
organization
these
admissions
suffice
for
guessing
the
riddle
of
substances
and
of
man
it
thus
appears
that
there
is
but
one
type
of
organization
in
the
universe
and
that
man
is
the
most
perfect
example
he
is
to
the
ape
and
to
the
most
intelligent
animals
as
the
planetary
pendulum
of
huyghens
is
to
a
watch
of
julien
leroy
more
instruments
more
wheels
and
more
springs
were
necessary
to
mark
the
movements
of
the
planets
than
to
mark
or
strike
the
hours
and
vaucanson
who
needed
more
skill
for
making
his
flute
player
than
for
making
his
duck
would
have
needed
still
more
to
make
a
talking
man
a
mechanism
no
longer
to
be
regarded
as
impossible
especially
in
the
hands
of
another
prometheus
in
like
fashion
it
was
necessary
that
nature
should
use
more
elaborate
art
in
making
and
sustaining
a
machine
which
for
a
whole
century
could
mark
all
motions
of
the
heart
and
of
the
mind
for
though
one
does
not
tell
time
by
the
pulse
it
is
at
least
the
barometer
of
the
warmth
and
the
vivacity
by
which
one
may
estimate
the
nature
of
the
soul
i
am
right
the
human
body
is
a
watch
a
large
watch
constructed
with
such
skill
and
ingenuity
that
if
the
wheel
which
marks
the
seconds
happens
to
stop
the
minute
wheel
turns
and
keeps
on
going
its
round
and
in
the
same
way
the
wheel
and
all
the
others
go
on
running
when
the
first
wheels
have
stopped
because
rusty
or
for
any
reason
out
of
order
is
it
not
for
a
similar
reason
that
the
stoppage
of
a
few
blood
vessels
is
not
enough
to
destroy
or
suspend
the
strength
of
the
movement
which
is
in
the
heart
as
in
the
mainspring
of
the
machine
since
on
the
contrary
the
fluids
whose
volume
is
diminished
having
a
shorter
road
to
travel
cover
the
ground
more
quickly
borne
on
as
by
a
fresh
current
which
the
energy
of
the
heart
increases
in
proportion
to
the
resistance
it
encounters
at
the
ends
of
the
and
is
not
this
the
reason
why
the
loss
of
sight
caused
by
the
compression
of
the
optic
nerve
and
by
its
ceasing
to
convey
the
images
of
objects
no
more
hinders
hearing
than
the
loss
of
hearing
caused
by
obstruction
of
the
functions
of
the
auditory
nerve
implies
the
loss
of
sight
in
the
same
way
finally
does
not
one
man
hear
except
immediately
after
his
attack
without
being
able
to
say
that
he
hears
while
another
who
hears
nothing
but
whose
lingual
nerves
are
uninjured
in
the
brain
mechanically
tells
of
all
the
dreams
which
pass
through
his
mind
these
phenomena
do
not
surprise
enlightened
physicians
at
all
they
know
what
to
think
about
man
nature
and
more
accurately
to
express
myself
in
passing
of
two
physicians
the
better
one
and
the
one
who
deserves
more
confidence
is
always
in
my
opinion
the
one
who
is
more
versed
in
the
physique
or
mechanism
of
the
human
body
and
who
leaving
aside
the
soul
and
all
the
anxieties
which
this
chimera
gives
to
fools
and
to
ignorant
men
is
seriously
occupied
only
in
pure
naturalism
therefore
let
the
pretended
charp
deride
philosophers
who
have
regarded
animals
as
machines
how
different
is
my
view
i
believe
that
descartes
would
be
a
man
in
every
way
worthy
of
respect
if
born
in
a
century
that
he
had
not
been
obliged
to
enlighten
he
had
known
the
value
of
experiment
and
observation
and
the
danger
of
cutting
loose
from
them
but
it
is
none
the
less
just
for
me
to
make
an
authentic
reparation
to
this
great
man
for
all
the
insignificant
philosophers
poor
jesters
and
poor
imitators
of
locke
who
instead
of
laughing
impudently
at
descartes
might
better
realize
that
without
him
the
field
of
philosophy
like
the
field
of
science
without
newton
might
perhaps
be
still
uncultivated
this
celebrated
philosopher
it
is
true
was
much
deceived
and
no
one
denies
that
but
at
any
rate
he
understood
animal
nature
he
was
the
first
to
prove
completely
that
animals
are
pure
machines
and
after
a
discovery
of
this
importance
demanding
so
much
sagacity
how
can
we
without
ingratitude
fail
to
pardon
all
his
errors
in
my
eyes
they
are
all
atoned
for
by
that
great
confession
for
after
all
although
he
extols
the
distinctness
of
the
two
substances
this
is
plainly
but
a
trick
of
skill
a
ruse
of
style
to
make
theologians
swallow
a
poison
hidden
in
the
shade
of
an
analogy
which
strikes
everybody
else
and
which
they
alone
fail
to
notice
for
it
is
this
this
strong
analogy
which
forces
all
scholars
and
wise
judges
to
confess
that
these
proud
and
vain
beings
more
distinguished
by
their
pride
than
by
the
name
of
men
however
much
they
may
wish
to
exalt
themselves
are
at
bottom
only
animals
and
machines
which
though
upright
go
on
all
fours
they
all
have
this
marvelous
instinct
which
is
developed
by
education
into
mind
and
which
always
has
its
seat
in
the
brain
or
for
want
of
that
when
it
is
lacking
or
hardened
in
the
medulla
oblongata
and
never
in
the
cerebellum
for
i
have
often
seen
the
cerebellum
injured
and
other
observers
have
found
it
hardened
when
the
soul
has
not
ceased
to
fulfil
its
functions
to
be
a
machine
to
feel
to
think
to
know
how
to
distinguish
good
from
bad
as
well
as
blue
from
yellow
in
a
word
to
be
born
with
an
intelligence
and
a
sure
moral
instinct
and
to
be
but
an
animal
are
therefore
characters
which
are
no
more
contradictory
than
to
be
an
ape
or
a
parrot
and
to
be
able
to
give
oneself
pleasure
i
believe
that
thought
is
so
little
incompatible
with
organized
matter
that
it
seems
to
be
one
of
its
properties
on
a
par
with
electricity
the
faculty
of
motion
impenetrability
extension
etc
do
you
ask
for
further
observations
here
are
some
which
are
incontestable
and
which
all
prove
that
man
resembles
animals
perfectly
in
his
origin
as
well
as
in
all
the
points
in
which
we
have
thought
it
essential
to
make
the
comparison
let
us
observe
man
both
in
and
out
of
his
shell
let
us
examine
young
embryos
of
four
six
eight
or
fifteen
days
with
a
microscope
after
that
time
our
eyes
are
sufficient
what
do
we
see
the
head
alone
a
little
round
egg
with
two
black
points
which
mark
the
eyes
before
that
everything
is
formless
and
one
sees
only
a
medullary
pulp
which
is
the
brain
in
which
are
formed
first
the
roots
of
the
nerves
that
is
the
principle
of
feeling
and
the
heart
which
already
within
this
substance
has
the
power
of
beating
of
itself
it
is
the
punctum
saliens
of
malpighi
which
perhaps
already
owes
a
part
of
its
excitability
to
the
influence
of
the
nerves
then
little
by
little
one
sees
the
head
lengthen
from
the
neck
which
in
dilating
forms
first
the
thorax
inside
which
the
heart
has
already
sunk
there
to
become
stationary
below
that
is
the
abdomen
which
is
divided
by
a
partition
the
diaphragm
one
of
these
enlargements
of
the
body
forms
the
arms
the
hands
the
fingers
the
nails
and
the
hair
the
other
forms
the
thighs
the
legs
the
feet
which
differ
only
in
their
observed
situation
and
which
constitute
the
support
and
the
balancing
pole
of
the
body
the
whole
process
is
a
strange
sort
of
growth
like
that
of
plants
on
the
tops
of
our
heads
is
hair
in
place
of
which
the
plants
have
leaves
and
flowers
everywhere
is
shown
the
same
luxury
of
nature
and
finally
the
directing
principle
of
plants
is
placed
where
we
have
our
soul
that
other
quintessence
of
man
such
is
the
uniformity
of
nature
which
we
are
beginning
to
realize
and
the
analogy
of
the
animal
with
the
vegetable
kingdom
of
man
with
plant
perhaps
there
even
are
animal
plants
which
in

to

nature
is
no

she
creates
millions
of

with
a
facility
and
a
pleasure
more
intense
than
the

of
a

in
making
the

her

forth
equally
in

in

kingdom
costs
her
no

the
most
splendid

no

let
us
then
judge
by
what
we
see
of
that
which
is
hidden
from
the
curiosity
of
our
eyes
and
of
our
investigations
and
let
us
not
imagine
anything
beyond
let
us
observe
the
ape
the
beaver
the
elephant
in
their
operations
if
it
is
clear
that
these
activities
can
not
be
performed
without
intelligence
why
refuse
intelligence
to
these
animals
and
if
you
grant
them
a
soul
you
are
lost
you
fanatics
you
will
in
vain
say
that
you
assert
nothing
about
the
nature
of
the
animal
soul
and
that
you
deny
its
immortality
who
does
not
see
that
this
is
a
gratuitous
assertion
who
does
not
see
that
the
soul
of
an
animal
must
be
either
mortal
or
immortal
whichever
ours
is
and
that
it
must
therefore
undergo
the
same
fate
as
ours
whatever
that
may
be
and
that
thus
in
admitting
that
animals
have
souls
you
fall
into
scylla
in
the
effort
to
avoid
charybdis
break
the
chain
of
your
prejudices
arm
yourselves
with
the
torch
of
experience
and
you
will
render
to
nature
the
honor
she
deserves
instead
of
inferring
anything
to
her
disadvantage
from
the
ignorance
in
which
she
has
left
you
only
open
wide
your
eyes
only
disregard
what
you
can
not
understand
and
you
will
see
that
the
ploughman
whose
intelligence
and
ideas
extend
no
further
than
the
bounds
of
his
furrow
does
not
differ
essentially
from
the
greatest
genius
a
truth
which
the
dissection
of
descartes
and
of
newton
brains
would
have
proved
you
will
be
persuaded
that
the
imbecile
and
the
fool
are
animals
with
human
faces
as
the
intelligent
ape
is
a
little
man
in
another
shape
in
short
you
will
learn
that
since
everything
depends
absolutely
on
difference
of
organization
a
well
constructed
animal
which
has
studied
astronomy
can
predict
an
eclipse
as
it
can
predict
recovery
or
death
when
it
has
used
its
genius
and
its
clearness
of
vision
for
a
time
in
the
school
of
hippocrates
and
at
the
bedside
of
the
sick
by
this
line
of
observations
and
truths
we
come
to
connect
the
admirable
power
of
thought
with
matter
without
being
able
to
see
the
links
because
the
subject
of
this
attribute
is
essentially
unknown
to
us
let
us
not
say
that
every
machine
or
every
animal
perishes
altogether
or
assumes
another
form
after
death
for
we
know
absolutely
nothing
about
the
subject
on
the
other
hand
to
assert
that
an
immortal
machine
is
a
chimera
or
a
logical
fiction
is
to
reason
as
absurdly
as
caterpillars
would
reason
if
seeing
the
skins
of
their
they
should
bitterly
deplore
the
fate
of
their
species
which
to
them
would
seem
to
come
to
nothing
the
soul
of
these
insects
for
each
animal
has
his
own
is
too
limited
to
comprehend
the
metamorphoses
of
nature
never
one
of
the
most
skilful
among
them
could
have
imagined
that
it
was
destined
to
become
a
butterfly
it
is
the
same
with
us
what
more
do
we
know
of
our
destiny
than
of
our
origin
let
us
then
submit
to
an
invincible
ignorance
on
which
our
happiness
depends
he
who
so
thinks
will
be
wise
just
tranquil
about
his
fate
and
therefore
happy
he
will
await
death
without
either
fear
or
desire
and
will
cherish
life
hardly
understanding
how
disgust
can
corrupt
a
heart
in
this
place
of
many
delights
he
will
be
filled
with
reverence
gratitude
affection
and
tenderness
for
nature
in
proportion
to
his
feeling
of
the
benefits
he
has
received
from
nature
he
will
be
happy
in
short
in
feeling
nature
and
in
being
present
at
the
enchanting
spectacle
of
the
universe
and
he
will
surely
never
destroy
nature
either
in
himself
or
in
others
more
than
that
full
of
humanity
this
man
will
love
human
character
even
in
his
enemies
judge
how
he
will
treat
others
he
will
pity
the
wicked
without
hating
them
in
his
eyes
they
will
be
but
men
but
in
pardoning
the
faults
of
the
structure
of
mind
and
body
he
will
none
the
less
admire
the
beauties
and
the
virtues
of
both
those
whom
nature
shall
have
favored
will
seem
to
him
to
deserve
more
respect
than
those
whom
she
has
treated
in
stepmotherly
fashion
thus
as
we
have
seen
natural
gifts
the
source
of
all
acquirements
gain
from
the
lips
and
heart
of
the
materialist
the
homage
which
every
other
thinker
unjustly
refuses
them
in
short
the
materialist
convinced
in
spite
of
the
protests
of
his
vanity
that
he
is
but
a
machine
or
an
animal
will
not
maltreat
his
kind
for
he
will
know
too
well
the
nature
of
those
actions
whose
humanity
is
always
in
proportion
to
the
degree
of
the
analogy
proved
above
between
human
beings
and
animals
and
following
the
natural
law
given
to
all
animals
he
will
not
wish
to
do
to
others
what
he
would
not
wish
them
to
do
to
him
let
us
then
conclude
boldly
that
man
is
a
machine
and
that
in
the
whole
universe
there
is
but
a
single
substance
differently
modified
this
is
no
hypothesis
set
forth
by
dint
of
a
number
of
postulates
and
assumptions
it
is
not
the
work
of
prejudice
nor
even
of
my
reason
alone
i
should
have
disdained
a
guide
which
i
think
to
be
so
untrustworthy
had
not
my
senses
bearing
a
torch
so
to
speak
induced
me
to
follow
reason
by
lighting
the
way
themselves
experience
has
thus
spoken
to
me
in
behalf
of
reason
and
in
this
way
i
have
combined
the
two
but
it
must
have
been
noticed
that
i
have
not
allowed
myself
even
the
most
vigorous
and
immediately
deduced
reasoning
except
as
a
result
of
a
multitude
of
observations
which
no
scholar
will
contest
and
furthermore
i
recognize
only
scholars
as
judges
of
the
conclusions
which
i
draw
from
the
observations
and
i
hereby
challenge
every
prejudiced
man
who
is
neither
anatomist
nor
acquainted
with
the
only
philosophy
which
can
here
be
considered
that

the

extracts
chapter
ii
concerning
matter
all
philosophers
who
have
examined
attentively
the
nature
of
matter
considered
in
itself
independently
of
all
the
forms
which
constitute
bodies
have
discovered
in
this
substance
diverse
properties
proceeding
from
an
absolutely
unknown
essence
such
are
the
capacity
of
taking
on
different
forms
which
are
produced
in
matter
itself
by
which
matter
can
acquire
moving
force
and
the
faculty
of
feeling
actual
extension
which
these
philosophers
have
rightly
recognized
as
an
attribute
but
not
as
the
essence
of
matter
however
there
have
been
some
among
others
descartes
who
have
insisted
on
reducing
the
essence
of
matter
to
simple
extension
and
on
limiting
all
the
properties
of
matter
to
those
of
extension
but
this
opinion
has
been
rejected
by
all
other
modern
philosophers
so
that
the
power
of
acquiring
moving
force
and
the
faculty
of
feeling
as
well
as
that
of
extension
have
been
from
all
time
considered
as
essential
properties
of
matter
all
the
diverse
properties
that
are
observed
in
this
unknown
principle
demonstrate
a
being
in
which
these
same
properties
exist
a
being
which
must
therefore
exist
through
itself
but
we
can
not
conceive
or
rather
it
seems
impossible
that
a
being
which
exists
through
itself
should
be
able
neither
to
create
nor
to
annihilate
itself
it
is
evident
that
only
the
forms
to
which
its
essential
properties
make
it
susceptible
can
be
destroyed
and
reproduced
in
turn
thus
does
experience
force
us
to
confess
that
nothing
can
come
from
nothing
all
philosophers
who
have
not
known
the
light
of
faith
have
thought
that
this
substantial
principle
of
bodies
has
existed
and
will
exist
forever
and
that
the
elements
of
matter
have
an
indestructible
solidity
which
forbids
the
fear
that
the
world
is
going
to
fall
to
pieces
the
majority
of
christian
philosophers
also
recognize
that
the
substantial
principle
of
bodies
exists
necessarily
through
itself
and
that
the
power
of
beginning
or
ending
does
not
accord
with
its
nature
one
finds
that
this
view
is
upheld
by
an
author
of
the
last
century
who
taught
theology
in
paris
chapter
iii
concerning
the
extension
of
matter
although
we
have
no
idea
of
the
essence
of
matter
we
can
not
refuse
to
admit
the
existence
of
the
properties
which
our
senses
discover
in
it
i
open
my
eyes
and
i
see
around
me
only
matter
or
the
extended
extension
is
then
a
property
which
always
belongs
to
all
matter
which
can
belong
to
matter
alone
and
which
therefore
is
inseparable
from
the
substance
of
matter
this
property
presupposes
three
dimensions
in
the
substance
of
bodies
length
width
and
depth
truly
if
we
consult
our
knowledge
which
is
gained
entirely
from
the
senses
we
can
not
conceive
of
matter
or
the
substance
of
bodies
without
having
the
idea
of
a
being
which
is
at
the
same
time
long
broad
and
deep
because
the
idea
of
these
three
dimensions
is
necessarily
bound
up
with
our
idea
of
every
magnitude
or
quantity
those
philosophers
who
have
meditated
most
concerning
matter
do
not
understand
by
the
extension
of
this
substance
a
solid
extension
composed
of
distinct
parts
capable
of
resistance
nothing
is
united
nothing
is
divided
in
this
extension
for
there
must
be
a
force
which
separates
to
divide
and
another
force
to
unite
the
divided
parts
but
in
the
opinion
of
these
physical
philosophers
matter
has
no
actually
active
force
because
every
force
can
come
only
from
movement
or
from
some
impulse
or
tendency
toward
movement
and
they
recognize
in
matter
stripped
of
all
form
by
abstraction
only
a
potential
moving
force
this
theory
is
hard
to
conceive
but
given
its
principles
it
is
rigorously
true
in
its
consequences
it
is
one
of
those
algebraic
truths
which
is
more
readily
believed
than
conceived
by
the
mind
the
extension
of
matter
is
then
but
a
metaphysical
extension
which
according
to
the
idea
of
these
very
philosophers
presents
nothing
to
affect
our
senses
they
rightly
think
that
only
solid
extension
can
make
an
impression
on
our
senses
it
thus
seems
to
us
that
extension
is
an
attribute
which
constitutes
part
of
the
metaphysical
form
but
we
are
far
from
thinking
that
extension
constitutes
its
essence
however
before
descartes
some
of
the
ancients
made
the
essence
of
matter
consist
in
solid
extension
but
this
opinion
of
which
all
the
cartesians
have
made
much
has
at
all
times
been
victoriously
combated
by
clear
reasons
which
we
will
set
forth
later
for
order
demands
that
we
first
examine
to
what
the
properties
of
extension
can
be
reduced
chapter
concerning
the
moving
force
of
matter
the
ancients
persuaded
that
there
is
no
body
without
a
moving
force
regarded
the
substance
of
bodies
as
composed
of
two
primitive
attributes
it
was
held
that
through
one
of
these
attributes
this
substance
has
the
capacity
for
moving
and
through
the
other
the
capacity
for
being
moved
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
impossible
not
to
conceive
these
two
attributes
in
every
moving
body
namely
the
thing
which
moves
and
the
same
thing
which
is
moved
it
has
just
been
said
that
formerly
the
name
matter
was
given
to
the
substance
of
bodies
in
so
far
as
it
is
susceptible
of
being
moved
when
capable
of
moving
this
same
matter
was
known
by
the
name
of
active
principle
but
these
two
attributes
seem
to
depend
so
essentially
on
each
other
that
cicero
in
order
better
to
state
this
essential
and
primitive
union
of
matter
with
its
moving
principle
says
that
each
is
found
in
the
other
this
expresses
very
well
the
idea
of
the
ancients
from
this
it
is
clear
that
modern
writers
have
given
us
but
an
inexact
idea
of
matter
in
attempting
through
a
confusion
ill
understood
to
give
this
name
to
the
substance
of
bodies
for
once
more
matter
or
the
passive
principle
of
the
substance
of
bodies
constitutes
only
one
part
of
this
substance
thus
it
is
not
surprising
that
these
modern
thinkers
have
not
discovered
in
matter
moving
force
and
the
faculty
of
feeling
it
should
now
be
evident
at
the
first
glance
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
an
active
principle
it
must
have
in
the
unknown
essence
of
matter
another
source
than
extension
this
proves
that
simple
extension
fails
to
give
an
adequate
idea
of
the
complete
essence
or
metaphysical
form
of
the
substance
of
bodies
and
that
this
failure
is
due
solely
to
the
fact
that
extension
excludes
the
idea
of
any
activity
in
matter
therefore
if
we
demonstrate
this
moving
principle
if
we
show
that
matter
far
from
being
as
indifferent
as
it
is
supposed
to
be
to
movement
and
to
rest
ought
to
be
regarded
as
an
active
as
well
as
a
passive
substance
what
resource
can
be
left
to
those
who
have
made
its
essence
consist
in
extension
the
two
principles
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
extension
and
moving
force
are
then
but
potentialities
of
the
substance
of
bodies
for
in
the
same
way
in
which
this
substance
is
susceptible
of
movement
without
actually
being
moved
it
also
has
always
even
when
it
is
not
moving
itself
the
faculty
of
spontaneous
motion
the
ancients
have
rightly
noticed
that
this
moving
force
acts
in
the
substance
of
bodies
only
when
the
substance
is
manifested
in
certain
forms
they
have
also
observed
that
the
different
motions
which
it
produces
are
all
subject
to
these
different
forms
or
regulated
by
them
that
is
why
the
forms
through
which
the
substance
of
bodies
can
not
only
move
but
also
move
in
different
ways
were
called
material
forms
once
these
early
masters
had
cast
their
eyes
on
all
the
phenomena
of
nature
they
discovered
in
the
substance
of
bodies
the
power
of
in
fact
this
substance
either
moves
itself
or
when
it
is
in
motion
the
motion
is
communicated
to
it
by
another
substance
but
can
anything
be
seen
in
this
substance
save
the
substance
itself
in
action
and
if
sometimes
it
seems
to
receive
a
motion
that
it
has
not
does
it
receive
that
motion
from
any
cause
other
than
this
same
kind
of
substance
whose
parts
act
the
one
upon
the
other
if
then
one
infers
another
agent
i
ask
what
agent
and
i
demand
proofs
of
its
existence
but
since
no
one
has
the
least
idea
of
such
an
agent
it
is
not
even
a
logical
entity
therefore
it
is
clear
that
the
ancients
must
have
easily
recognized
an
intrinsic
force
of
motion
within
the
substance
of
bodies
since
in
fact
it
is
impossible
to
prove
or
conceive
any
other
substance
acting
upon
it
descartes
a
genius
made
to
blaze
new
paths
and
to
go
astray
in
them
supposed
with
some
other
philosophers
that
god
is
the
only
efficient
cause
of
motion
and
that
every
instant
he
communicates
motion
to
all
bodies
but
this
opinion
is
but
an
hypothesis
which
he
tried
to
adjust
to
the
light
of
faith
and
in
so
doing
he
was
no
longer
attempting
to
speak
as
a
philosopher
or
to
philosophers
above
all
he
was
not
addressing
those
who
can
be
convinced
only
by
the
force
of
evidence
the
christian
scholastics
of
the
last
centuries
have
felt
the
full
force
of
this
reflection
for
this
reason
they
have
wisely
limited
themselves
to
purely
philosophic
knowledge
concerning
the
motion
of
matter
although
they
might
have
shown
that
god
himself
said
that
he
had
imprinted
an
active
principle
in
the
elements
of
matter
i
is
lxvi
one
might
here
make
up
a
long
list
of
authorities
and
take
from
the
most
celebrated
professors
the
substance
of
the
doctrine
of
all
the
rest
but
it
is
clear
enough
without
a
medley
of
citations
that
matter
contains
this
moving
force
which
animates
it
and
which
is
the
immediate
cause
of
all
the
laws
of
motion
chapter
vi
concerning
the
sensitive
faculty
of
matter
we
have
spoken
of
two
essential
attributes
of
matter
upon
which
depend
the
greater
number
of
its
properties
namely
extension
and
moving
force
we
have
now
but
to
prove
a
third
attribute
i
mean
the
faculty
of
feeling
which
the
philosophers
of
all
centuries
have
found
in
this
same
substance
i
say
all
philosophers
although
i
am
not
ignorant
of
all
the
efforts
which
the
cartesians
have
made
in
vain
to
rob
matter
of
this
faculty
but
in
order
to
avoid
insurmountable
difficulties
they
have
flung
themselves
into
a
labyrinth
from
which
they
have
thought
to
escape
by
this
absurd
system
that
animals
are
pure
machines
an
opinion
so
absurd
has
never
gained
admittance
among
philosophers
except
as
the
play
of
wit
or
as
a
philosophical
pastime
for
this
reason
we
shall
not
stop
to
refute
it
experience
gives
us
no
less
proof
of
the
faculty
of
feeling
in
animals
than
of
feeling
in
men
there
comes
up
another
difficulty
which
more
nearly
concerns
our
vanity
namely
the
impossibility
of
our
conceiving
this
property
as
a
dependence
or
attribute
of
matter
let
it
not
be
forgotten
that
this
substance
reveals
to
us
only
ineffable
characters
do
we
understand
better
how
extension
is
derived
from
its
essence
how
it
can
be
moved
by
a
primitive
force
whose
action
is
exerted
without
contact
and
a
thousand
other
miracles
so
hidden
from
the
gaze
of
the
most
penetrating
eyes
that
to
paraphrase
the
idea
of
an
illustrious
modern
writer
they
reveal
only
the
curtain
which
conceals
them
but
might
not
one
suppose
as
some
have
supposed
that
the
feeling
which
is
observed
in
animated
bodies
might
belong
to
a
being
distinct
from
the
matter
of
these
bodies
to
a
substance
of
a
different
nature
united
to
them
does
the
light
of
reason
allow
us
in
good
faith
to
admit
such
conjectures
we
know
in
bodies
only
matter
and
we
observe
the
faculty
of
feeling
only
in
bodies
on
what
foundation
then
can
we
erect
an
ideal
being
disowned
by
all
our
knowledge
however
we
must
admit
with
the
same
frankness
that
we
are
ignorant
whether
matter
has
in
itself
the
faculty
of
feeling
or
only
the
power
of
acquiring
it
by
those
modifications
or
forms
to
which
matter
is
susceptible
for
it
is
true
that
this
faculty
of
feeling
appears
only
in
organic
bodies
this
is
then
another
new
faculty
which
might
exist
only
potentially
in
matter
like
all
the
others
which
have
been
mentioned
and
this
was
the
hypothesis
of
the
ancients
whose
philosophy
full
of
insight
and
penetration
deserves
to
be
raised
above
the
ruins
of
the
philosophy
of
the
moderns
it
is
in
vain
that
the
latter
disdain
the
sources
too
remote
from
them
ancient
philosophy
will
always
hold
its
own
among
those
who
are
worthy
to
judge
it
because
it
forms
at
least
in
relation
to
the
subject
of
which
i
am
treating
a
system
that
is
solid
and
well
articulated
like
the
body
whereas
all
these
scattered
members
of
modern
philosophy
form
no
system

relation
to
his
predecessors
and
to
his
successors
i
the
historical
relation
of
la
mettrie
to
rené
descartes
the
most
direct
source
of
la
mettrie
work
if
the
physiological
aspect
of
his
system
is
set
aside
is
found
in
the
philosophy
of
descartes
in
fact
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
la
mettrie
materialism
grew
out
of
his
insistence
on
the
contradictory
character
of
the
dualistic
system
of
descartes
he
criticises
descartes
statement
that
the
body
and
soul
are
absolutely
independent
and
takes
great
pains
to
show
the
dependence
of
the
soul
on
the
body
yet
though
la
mettrie
system
may
be
opposed
to
that
of
descartes
from
one
point
of
view
from
another
point
of
view
it
seems
to
be
a
direct
consequence
of
it
la
mettrie
himself
recognizes
this
relationship
and
feels
that
his
doctrine
that
man
is
a
machine
is
a
natural
inference
from
descartes
teaching
that
animals
are
mere
machines
moreover
la
mettrie
carries
on
descartes
conception
of
the
body
as
a
machine
and
many
of
his
detailed
discussions
of
the
machinery
of
the
body
seem
to
have
been
drawn
from
descartes
it
should
be
noted
that
la
mettrie
did
justice
to
descartes
and
realized
how
much
all
philosophers
owed
to
him
he
insisted
moreover
that
descartes
errors
were
due
to
his
failure
to
follow
his
own
method
yet
la
mettrie
method
was
different
from
that
of
descartes
for
la
mettrie
was
an
empiricist
without
rationalistic
leaning
as
regards
doctrine
la
mettrie
differed
from
descartes
in
his
opinion
of
matter
since
he
disbelieved
in
any
spiritual
reality
he
gave
matter
the
attributes
of
motion
and
thought
while
descartes
insisted
that
the
one
attribute
of
matter
is
extension
it
was
a
natural
consequence
of
la
mettrie
disbelief
in
spiritual
substance
that
he
could
throw
doubt
on
the
existence
of
god
on
the
other
hand
the
belief
in
god
was
one
of
the
foundations
of
descartes
system
la
mettrie
tried
to
show
that
descartes
belief
in
a
soul
and
in
god
was
merely
designed
to
hide
his
true
thought
from
the
priests
and
to
save
himself
from
persecution
iia
the
likeness
of
la
mettrie
to
the
english
materialists
thomas
hobbes
and
john
toland
the
influence
of
descartes
upon
la
mettrie
can
not
be
questioned
but
it
is
more
difficult
to
estimate
the
influence
upon
him
of
materialistic
philosophers
hobbes
published
the
leviathan
in
and
de
corpore
in
thus
he
wrote
about
a
century
before
la
mettrie
and
since
the
eighteenth
century
was
one
in
which
the
influence
of
england
upon
france
was
very
great
it
is
easy
to
suppose
that
la
mettrie
had
read
hobbes
if
so
he
must
have
gained
many
ideas
from
him
the
extent
of
this
influence
is
however
unknown
for
la
mettrie
rarely
if
ever
quotes
from
hobbes
or
attributes
any
of
his
doctrines
to
hobbes
in
the
first
place
both
hobbes
and
la
mettrie
are
thoroughgoing
materialists
they
both
believe
that
body
is
the
only
reality
and
that
anything
spiritual
is
unimaginable
furthermore
their
conceptions
of
matter
are
very
similar
according
to
la
mettrie
matter
contains
the
faculty
of
sensation
and
the
power
of
motion
as
well
as
the
quality
of
extension
this
same
conception
of
matter
is
held
by
hobbes
for
he
specifically
attributes
extension
and
motion
to
matter
and
then
reduces
sensation
to
a
kind
of
internal
motion
thus
sensation
also
may
be
an
attribute
of
matter
moreover
hobbes
and
la
mettrie
are
in
agreement
on
many
smaller
points
and
la
mettrie
elaborates
much
that
is
suggested
in
hobbes
they
both
believe
that
the
passions
are
dependent
on
bodily
conditions
they
agree
in
the
belief
that
all
the
differences
in
men
are
due
to
differences
in
the
constitution
and
organization
of
their
bodies
they
both
discuss
the
nature
and
importance
of
language
hobbes
differs
from
la
mettrie
in
holding
that
we
can
be
sure
that
god
exists
as
the
cause
of
this
world
however
even
though
he
thinks
that
it
is
possible
to
know
that
god
exists
he
does
not
believe
that
we
can
know
his
nature
la
mettrie
system
may
be
regarded
as
the
application
of
a
system
like
that
of
hobbes
to
the
special
problem
of
the
relation
of
soul
and
body
in
man
for
if
there
is
nothing
in
the
universe
but
matter
and
motion
it
inevitably
follows
that
man
is
merely
a
very
complicated
machine
there
is
great
similarity
also
between
the
doctrine
of
la
mettrie
and
that
of
toland
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
points
of
resemblance
and
of
difference
toland
letters
to
serena
which
contain
much
of
his
philosophical
teaching
were
published
in
there
is
a
possibility
therefore
that
la
mettrie
read
them
and
gained
some
suggestions
from
them
the
point
most
emphasized
in
toland
teaching
is
that
motion
is
an
attribute
of
matter
he
argues
for
this
belief
on
the
ground
that
matter
must
be
essentially
active
in
order
to
undergo
change
and
that
the
conception
of
the
inertness
of
matter
is
based
on
the
conception
of
absolute
rest
and
that
this
absolute
rest
is
nowhere
to
be
found
since
motion
is
essential
to
matter
there
is
no
need
toland
believes
to
account
for
the
beginning
of
motion
those
who
have
regarded
matter
as
inert
have
had
to
find
some
efficient
cause
for
motion
and
to
do
this
they
have
held
that
all
nature
is
animated
but
this
pretended
animation
is
utterly
useless
since
matter
is
itself
endowed
with
motion
the
likeness
to
la
mettrie
is
evident
la
mettrie
likewise
opposes
the
doctrine
of
the
animation
of
matter
and
the
belief
in
any
external
cause
of
motion
yet
he
feels
the
need
of
postulating
some
beginning
of
motion
and
although
he
uses
the
conception
so
freely
he
does
not
agree
with
toland
that
the
nature
of
motion
is
known
he
believes
that
it
is
impossible
to
know
the
nature
of
motion
while
toland
believes
that
the
nature
of
motion
is
another
point
of
contrast
between
toland
and
la
mettrie
is
in
their
doctrines
of
god
toland
believes
that
god
a
pure
spirit
or
immaterial
being
is
necessary
for
his
system
while
la
mettrie
questions
god
existence
and
insists
that
immateriality
and
spirituality
are
fine
words
that
no
one
understands
it
must
be
admitted
in
truth
that
la
mettrie
and
toland
have
different
interests
and
different
points
of
view
toland
is
concerned
to
discover
the
essential
nature
of
matter
while
la
mettrie
problem
is
to
find
the
specific
relation
of
body
and
mind
on
this
relation
he
builds
his
whole
system
b
the
relation
of
la
mettrie
to
an
english
sensationalist
john
locke
locke
essay
concerning
human
understanding
was
published
in
and
la
mettrie
like
most
cultured
frenchmen
of
the
enlightenment
was
influenced
by
his
teaching
the
main
agreement
between
locke
and
la
mettrie
is
in
their
doctrine
that
all
ideas
are
derived
from
sensation
both
vigorously
oppose
the
belief
in
innate
ideas
teaching
that
even
our
most
complex
and
our
most
abstract
ideas
are
gained
through
sensation
but
la
mettrie
does
not
follow
locke
in
analyzing
these
ideas
and
in
concluding
that
many
sensible
qualities
of
objects
such
as
colors
sounds
have
no
existence
outside
the
mind
he
rejects
locke
doctrine
of
spiritual
substances
and
opposes
locke
theistic
teaching
laying
stress
on
the
other
hand
upon
locke
admission
of
the
possibility
that
thinking
being
may
also
be
material
iiia
the
likeness
probable
but
unacknowledged
to
la
mettrie
of
the
french
sensationalists
etienne
bonnot
de
condillac
and
claude
adrien
helvetius
condillac
traité
des
sensations
was
published
about
ten
years
after
la
mettrie
naturelle
de
and
therefore
it
is
probable
that
condillac
had
read
this
work
and
gained
some
ideas
from
it
yet
condillac
never
mentions
la
mettrie
name
nor
cites
his
doctrines
this
omission
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
works
of
la
mettrie
had
been
so
condemned
that
later
philosophers
wished
to
conceal
the
similarity
of
their
doctrines
to
his
whether
the
sensationalists
were
influenced
by
his
teachings
or
not
there
is
such
a
profound
likeness
in
their
teachings
that
la
mettrie
may
well
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
first
french
sensationalists
as
well
as
one
of
the
leading
french
materialists
of
the
time
condillac
and
la
mettrie
agree
that
experience
is
the
source
of
all
knowledge
as
lange
suggests
la
mettrie
development
of
reason
from
the
imagination
may
have
suggested
to
condillac
the
way
to
develop
all
the
faculties
from
the
soul
la
mettrie
asserts
that
reason
is
but
the
sensitive
soul
contemplating
its
ideas
and
that
imagination
plays
all
the
rôles
of
the
soul
while
condillac
elaborates
the
same
idea
and
shows
in
great
detail
how
all
the
faculties
of
the
soul
are
but
modifications
of
sensation
both
la
mettrie
and
condillac
believe
that
there
is
no
gulf
between
man
and
the
lower
animals
but
this
leads
to
a
point
of
disagreement
between
the
two
philosophers
for
condillac
absolutely
denies
that
animals
can
be
mere
machines
and
we
must
suppose
that
he
would
the
more
ardently
oppose
the
teaching
that
man
is
merely
a
complicated
machine
condillac
finally
unlike
la
mettrie
believes
in
the
existence
of
god
a
final
point
of
contrast
also
concerns
the
theology
of
the
two
writers
la
mettrie
insists
that
we
can
not
be
sure
that
there
is
any
purpose
in
the
world
while
condillac
affirms
that
we
can
discern
intelligence
and
design
throughout
the
universe
like
la
mettrie
and
condillac
helvetius
teaches
that
all
the
faculties
of
the
mind
can
be
reduced
to
sensation
unlike
la
mettrie
he
specifically
distinguishes
the
mind
from
the
soul
and
describes
the
mind
as
a
later
developed
product
of
the
soul
or
faculty
of
sensation
this
idea
may
have
been
suggested
by
la
statement
that
reason
is
a
modification
of
sensation
helvetius
however
unlike
la
mettrie
does
not
clearly
decide
that
sensation
is
but
a
result
of
bodily
conditions
and
he
admits
that
sensation
may
be
a
modification
of
a
spiritual
substance
moreover
he
claims
that
climate
and
food
have
no
effect
on
the
mind
and
that
the
superiority
of
the
understanding
is
not
dependent
on
the
strength
of
the
body
and
its
organs
la
mettrie
and
helvetius
resemble
each
other
in
ethical
doctrine
both
make
pleasure
and
pain
the
ruling
motives
of
man
conduct
they
claim
that
all
the
emotions
are
merely
modifications
of
corporeal
pleasure
and
pain
and
that
therefore
the
only
principle
of
action
in
man
is
the
desire
for
pleasure
and
the
fear
of
pain
b
the
likeness
to
la
mettrie
of
the
french
materialist
baron
paul
heinrich
dietrich
von
holbach
as
condillac
and
helvetius
emphasize
the
sensationalism
taught
by
la
mettrie
so
holbach
book
is
a
reiteration
and
elaboration
of
the
materialism
set
forth
in
la
mettrie
works
the
teaching
of
holbach
is
so
like
that
of
la
mettrie
that
the
similarity
can
hardly
be
a
coincidence
la
mettrie
regards
experience
as
the
only
teacher
holbach
dwells
on
this
same
idea
and
insists
that
experience
is
our
only
source
of
knowledge
in
all
matters
holbach
likewise
teaches
that
man
is
a
purely
material
being
he
disbelieves
in
any
spiritual
reality
whatsoever
and
makes
matter
the
only
substance
in
the
world
he
lays
stress
also
on
one
thought
which
is
a
natural
consequence
of
la
mettrie
teaching
la
mettrie
has
limited
the
action
of
the
will
and
has
insisted
that
the
will
is
dependent
on
bodily
conditions
holbach
goes
further
and
declares
repeatedly
that
all
freedom
is
a
delusion
and
that
man
is
controlled
in
every
action
by
rigid
necessity
this
teaching
seems
to
be
the
natural
outcome
of
the
belief
that
man
is
a
machine
holbach
atheistic
theology
is
more
extreme
than
his
predecessor
for
la
mettrie
admits
that
god
may
exist
while
holbach
vigorously
opposes
the
possibility
moreover
holbach
holds
the
opinion
barely
suggested
by
la
mettrie
that
an
atheistic
doctrine
would
ameliorate
the
condition
of
mankind
he
insists
that
the
idea
of
god
has
hindered
the
progress
of
reason
and
interfered
with
natural
law
holbach
is
indeed
the
only
one
of
the
philosophers
here
discussed
who
frankly
adopts
a
fatalistic
and
atheistic
doctrine
of
the
universe
in
these
respects

notes
on
man
a
machine
matter
may
well
be
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
thought
although
la
mettrie
attempts
to
avoid
this
reef
by
refraining
from
the
use
of
these
words
yet
he
asserts
throughout
his
work
that
sensations
consciousness
and
the
soul
itself
are
modifications
of
matter
and
motion
the
possibility
of
matter
being
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
thought
is
denied
by
elie
luzac
the
publisher
of
machine
in
his
work
plus
que
machine
in
this
work
he
tries
to
disprove
the
conclusions
of
machine
he
says
we
have
therefore
proved
by
the
idea
of
the
inert
state
of
matter
by
that
of
motion
by
that
of
relations
by
that
of
activity
by
that
of
extension
that
matter
can
not
be
possessed
of
the
faculty
of
thinking
to
be
brief
i
say
that
if
by
a
material
substance
we
understand
that
matter
which
falls
under
the
cognizance
of
our
senses
and
which
is
endowed
with
the
qualities
we
have
mentioned
the
soul
can
not
be
material
so
that
it
must
be
immaterial
and
for
the
same
reason
god
could
not
have
given
the
faculty
of
thinking
to
matter
since
he
can
not
perform
contradictions
how
can
we
define
a
being
whose
nature
is
absolutely
unknown
to
us
la
mettrie
uses
this
as
an
argument
against
the
belief
in
a
soul
and
yet
he
later
admits
that
the
nature
of
motion
is
as
unknown
to
us
as
the
nature
of
matter
it
is
difficult
then
to
see
why
there
is
more
reason
to
doubt
the
existence
of
spirit
than
to
doubt
the
existence
of
matter
locke
makes
this
point
very
well
it
is
for
want
of
reflection
that
we
are
apt
to
think
that
our
senses
show
us
nothing
but
material
things
every
act
of
sensation
when
duly
considered
gives
us
an
equal
view
of
both
parts
of
nature
the
corporeal
and
spiritual
if
this
notion
of
immaterial
spirit
may
have
perhaps
some
difficulties
in
it
not
easy
to
be
explained
we
have
therefore
no
more
reason
to
deny
or
doubt
the
existence
of
such
spirits
than
we
have
to
deny
or
doubt
the
existence
of
body
because
the
notion
of
body
is
cumbered
with
some
difficulties
very
hard
and
perhaps
impossible
to
be
explained
or
understood

us

he
was

nominated
as

professor
of

in

in
he
made
his
most
famous
discovery
he
found
that
the
height
to
which
a
liquid
will
rise
in
a
closed
tube
depends
on
the
specific
gravity
of
the
liquid
and
concludes
from
this
that
the
column
of
liquid
is
sustained
by
atmospheric
pressure
this
discovery
did
away
with
the
obscure
idea
of
a
fuga
vacui
and
laid
bare
the
principle
on
which
mercurial
barometers
are
constructed
for
a
long
time
the
mercurial
thermometer
was
called
the
torricellian
tube
and
the
vacuum
which
the
barometer
includes
is
still
known
as
a
torricellian
vacuum
only
the

have
a
right
to
speak
on
this
subject
luzac
says
is
true
that
if
the
materiality
of
the
soul
was
proved
the
knowledge
of
her
would
be
an
object
of
natural
philosophy
and
we
might
with
some
appearance
of
reason
reject
all
arguments
to
the
contrary
which
are
not
drawn
from
that
science
but
if
the
soul
is
not
material
the
investigation
of
its
nature
does
not
belong
to
natural
philosophy
but
to
those
who
search
into
the
nature
of
its
faculties
and
are
called
metaphysicians
man
is
a
machine
this
is
the
first
clear
statement
of
this
theory
which
as
the
title
of
the
work
indicates
is
the
central
doctrine
of
this
work
descartes
had
strongly
denied
the
possibility
of
conceiving
man
as
a
machine
we
may
easily
conceive
a
machine
to
be
so
constructed
that
it
emits
vocables
and
even
that
it
emits
some
correspondent
to
the
action
upon
it
of
external
objects
which
cause
a
change
in
its
organs
but
not
that
it
should
emit
them
variously
so
as
appositely
to
reply
to
what
is
said
in
its
presence
as
men
of
the
lowest
grade
of
intellect
can
do
let
us
then
take
in
our
hands
the
staff
of
experience
la
mettrie
repeatedly
emphasizes
the
belief
that
knowledge
must
come
from
experience
moreover
he
confines
this
experience
to
sense
experience
and
concludes
naturelle
de
with
these
words
no
senses
no
ideas
the
fewer
senses
there
are
the
fewer
ideas
no
sensations
experienced
no
ideas
these
principles
are
the
necessary
consequence
of
all
the
observations
and
experiences
that
constitute
the
unassailable
foundation
of
this
work
this
doctrine
is
opposed
to
the
teaching
of
descartes
who
insists
that
neither
our
imagination
nor
our
senses
can
give
us
assurance
of
anything
unless
our
understanding
intervene
moreover
descartes
believes
that
the
senses
are
fallacious
and
that
the
ideal
method
for
philosophy
is
a
method
corresponding
to
that
of
mathematics
condillac
and
holbach
agree
with
la
mettrie
opinion
thus
condillac
teaches
that
man
is
nothing
more
than
what
he
has
become
by
the
use
of
his
senses
and
holbach
says
as
soon
as
we
take
leave
of
experience
we
fall
into
the
chasm
where
our
imagination
leads
us
astray

he
was

he
insisted
that
diseases
must
be
treated
by
the
physician
as
if
they
were
governed
by
purely
natural
laws
the
greeks
had
such
respect
for
dead
bodies
that
hippocrates
could
not
have
dissected
a
human
body
and
consequently
his
knowledge
of
its
structure
was
limited
but
he
seems
to
have
been
an
acute
and
skilful
observer
of
conditions
in
the
living
body
he
wrote
several
works
on
medicine
and
in
one
of
them
showed
the
first
principles
on
which
the
public
health
must
be
based
the
details
of
his
life
are
hidden
by
tradition
but
it
is
certain
that
he
was
regarded
with
great
respect
and
veneration
by
the
greeks
the
different
combinations
of
these
humors
compare
this
with
descartes
statement
that
the
difference
in
men
comes
from
the
difference
in
the
construction
and

of
the

causes

go
from

where
they
are

luzac
sums
up
the
preceding
facts
by
saying
here
are
a
great
many
facts
but
what
is
it
they
prove
only
that
the
faculties
of
the
soul
arise
grow
and
acquire
strength
in
proportion
as
the
body
does
so
that
these
same
faculties
are
weakened
in
the
same
proportion
as
the
body
is
but
from
all
these
circumstances
it
does
not
follow
that
the
faculty
of
thinking
is
an
attribute
of
matter
and
that
all
depends
on
the
manner
in
which
our
machine
is
made
that
the
faculties
of
the
soul
arise
from
a
principle
of
animal
life
from
an
innate
heat
or
force
from
an
irritability
of
the
finest
parts
of
the
body
from
a
subtil
ethereal
matter
diffused
through
it
or
in
a
word
from
all
these
things
taken
together
the
diverse
states
of
the
soul
are
therefore
always
correlative
with
those
of
the
body
this
view
is
in
diametrical
opposition
to
the
teaching
of
descartes
who
says
the
soul
is
of
a
nature
wholly
independent
of
the
body
yet
descartes
also
states
that
there
is
an
intimate
connection
between
the
two
the
reasonable
soul
could
by
no
means
be
educed
from
the
power
of
matter
it
must
be
expressly
created
and
it
is
not
sufficient
that
it
be
lodged
in
the
human
body
exactly
like
a
pilot
in
a
ship
unless
perhaps
to
move
its
members
but
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
be
joined
and
united
more
closely
to
the
body
in
order
to
have
sensations
and
appetites
similar
to
ours
and
thus
constitute
a
real
man
holbach
later
emphasizes
this
close
connection
between
body
and
soul
which
is
so
insisted
upon
by
la
mettrie
if
freed
from
our
prejudices
we
wish
to
see
our
soul
or
the
moving
principle
which
acts
in
us
we
shall
remain
convinced
that
it
is
part
of
our
body
that
it
can
not
be
distinguished
from
the
body
except
by
an
abstraction
that
it
is
but
the
body
itself
considered
relatively
to
some
of
the
functions
or
faculties
to
which
its
nature
and
particular
organization
make
it
susceptible
we
shall
see
that
this
soul
is
forced
to
undergo
the
same
changes
as
the
body
that
it
grows
and
develops
with
the
body
finally
we
can
not
help
recognizing
that
at
some
periods
it
shows
evident
signs
of
weakness

compare

it
is
of

interest
that
the

seems

to
be
a
stage
in

amman
was
born
at

in

in
after
his
graduation
at
basle
he
practised
medicine
at
amsterdam
he
devoted
most
of
his
attention
to
the
instruction
of
deaf
mutes
he
taught
them
by
attracting
their
attention
to
the
motion
of
his
lips
tongue
and
larynx
while
he
was
speaking
and
by
persuading
them
to
imitate
these
motions
in
this
way
they
finally
learned
to
articulate
syllables
and
words
and
to
talk
in
his
works
surdus

and
dissertatio
de

he
explained
the
mechanism
of
speech
and
made
public
his
method
of
instruction
from
all
accounts
it
seems
that
his
success
with
the
deaf
mutes
was
remarkable
he
died
about
the
great
analogy
between
ape
and
man
compare
haeckel
thus
comparative
anatomy
proves
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
unprejudiced
and
critical
student
the
significant
fact
that
the
body
of
man
and
that
of
the
anthropoid
ape
are
not
only
peculiarly
similar
but
they
are
practically
one

that

but
if
thought

all

depended
only
on

in
although
the
child
of
protestant
parents
he
was
converted
by
the
jesuits
after
his
reconversion
to
protestantism
he
was
driven
out
of
france
and
took
refuge
first
in
geneva
and
then
in
holland
in
he
became
professor
of
philosophy
at
the
protestant
college
of
sedan
and
in
professor
of
philosophy
and
history
at
rotterdam
in
he
was
forced
to
resign
from
his
position
on
account
of
his
religious
views
bayle
was
one
of
the
leading
french
sceptics
of
the
time
he
was
a
cartesian
but
questioned
both
the
certainty
of
one
own
existence
and
the
knowledge
derived
from
it
he
declared
that
religion
is
contrary
to
the
human
reason
but
that
this
fact
does
not
necessarily
destroy
faith
he
distinguished
religion
not
only
from
science
but
also
from
morality
and
vigorously
opposed
those
who
considered
a
certain
religion
necessary
for
morality
he
did
not
openly
attack
christianity
yet
all
that
he
wrote
awakened
doubt
and
his
work
exerted
an
extensive
influence
for
scepticism
his
principal
work
is
the
dictionnaire
historique
et
critique
published
and
containing
a
vast
amount
of
knowledge
expressed
in
a
piquant
and
popular
style
this
fact
made

widely
read
both
by

arnobius
the

was
born
at

in

in
the
latter
part
of
the
third
century
he
was
at
first
an
opponent
of
christianity
but
was
afterwards
converted
and
wrote
adversus
gentes
as
an
apology
for
christianity
in
this
work
he
tries
to
answer
the
complaints
made
against
christians
on
the
ground
that
the
disasters
of
the
time
were
due
to
their
impiety
vindicates
the
divinity
of
christ
and
discusses
the
nature
of
the
human
soul
he
concludes
that
the
soul
is
not
immortal
for
he
believes
that
the
belief
in
the
immortality
of
the
soul
would
have
a
deteriorating
influence
on
morality

translation
of
his
work

also
attributed
remorse
to
animals
but
believed
that
they
are
none
the
less
machines
luzac
said
in
comment
what
renders
these
systems
completely
ridiculous
is
that
the
persons
who
pronounce
men
machines
give
them
properties
which
belie
their
assertion
if
beings
are
but
machines
why
do
they
grant
a
natural
law
an
internal
sense
a
kind
of
dread
these
are
ideas
which
can
not
be
excited
by
objects
which
operate
on
our
senses
nature
has
created
us
solely
to
be
happy
this
is
a
statement
of
the
doctrine
which
la
mettrie
develops
in
his
principal
ethical
work
discours
sur
le
bonheur
he
teaches
that
happiness
rests
upon
bodily
pleasure
and
pain
in
naturelle
de
la
mettrie
states
that
all
the
passions
can
be
developed
from
two
fundamental
passions
of
which
they
are
but
modifications
love
and
hatred
or
desire
and
aversion
like
la
mettrie
helvetius
makes
corporeal
pleasure
and
pain
the
ruling
motives
for
man
conduct
thus
he
writes
pleasure
and
pain
are
and
always
will
be
the
only
principles
of
action
in
man
remorse
is
nothing
more
than
a
foresight
of
bodily
pain
to
which
some
crime
has
exposed
us
he
definitely
makes
happiness
the
end
of
human
action
the
end
of
man
is
and
the
attainment
of
a
happy
existence
man
to
find
happiness
should
save
up
his
pleasures
and
refuse
all
those
which
might
change
into
pains
the
passions
always
have
happiness
as
an
object
they
are
legitimate
and
natural
and
can
not
be
called
good
or
bad
except
on
account
of
their
influence
on
human
beings
to
lead
men
to
virtue
we
must
show
them
the
advantages
of
virtuous
actions
holbach
finally
goes
further
than
la
mettrie
or
helvetius
and
makes
purely
mechanical
impulses
the
motives
of
man
action
the
passions
are
ways
of
being
or
modifications
of
the
internal
organs
attracted
or
repulsed
by
objects
and
are
consequently
subject
in
their
own
way
to
the
physical
laws
of
attraction
and
repulsion

who
can
be
sure
that
the
reason
for
man
existence
is
not
simply
the
fact
that
he
exists
luzac
opposes
this
by
saying
if
the
reason
of
man
existence
was
in
man
himself
this
existence
would
be
a
necessary
consequence
of
his
own
nature
so
that
his
own
nature
would
contain
the
cause
or
reason
of
his
existence
now
since
his
own
nature
would
imply
the
cause
of
his
existence
it
would
also
imply
his
existence
itself
so
that
man
could
no
more
be
considered
as
than
a
circle
can
be
considered
without
radii
or
a
picture
without
features
or
proportions
if
the
existence
of
man
was
in
man
himself
he
would
then
be
an
invariable
being

that
reason
is
superior
to
any
authority
they
denied
the
necessity
of
any
supernatural
revelation
and
were
consequently
vigorously
opposed
by
the
church
partly
because
of
this
opposition
by
the
church
many
of
them
argued
against
christianity
and
tried
to
show
that
an
observance
of
moral
laws
is
the
only
religion
necessary
for
man
they
taught
that
happiness
is
man
chief
end
and
that
since
man
is
a
social
being
his
happiness
can
best
be
gained
by
mutual
helpfulness
although
they
declared
that
nature
is
the
work
of
a
perfect
being
they
had
a
mechanical
conception
of
the
relation
of
god
to
the

and
did
not
like
later

find
evidence
of

shut

the

in

in

he
was

enough
to
restrict

tried
to
extend
its
application

were

absurd
conjectures

descartes
on
the

hand
teaches
that
the
soul
has
direct
control
over
its
voluntary
actions
and
thoughts
and
indirect
control
over
its
passions
la
mettrie
goes
further
than
to
limit
the
extent
of
the
will
and
questions
whether
it
is
ever
free
the
sensations
which
affect
us
decide
the

either
to
will

not
to
will
to
love
or
to
hate
these
sensations
according
to
the
pleasure
or
the
pain
which
they
cause
in
us
this
state
of
the
soul
thus
determined
by
its
sensations
is
called
the
will
holbach
insists
on
this
point
and
contends
that
all
freedom
is
a
delusion
man
birth
depends
on
causes
entirely
outside
of
his
power
it
is
without
his
permission
that
he
enters
this
system
where
he
has
a
place
and
without
his
consent
that
from
the
moment
of
his
birth
to
the
day
of
his
death
he
is
continually
modified
by
causes
that
influence
his
machine
in
spite
of
his
will
modify
his
being
and
alter
his
conduct
is
not
the
least
reflexion
enough
to
prove
that
the
solids
and
fluids
of
which
the
body
is
composed
and
that
the
hidden
mechanism
that
he
considers
independent
of
external
causes
are
perpetually
under
the
influence
of
these
causes
and
could
not
act
without
them
does
he
not
see
that
his
temperament
does
not
depend
on
himself
that
his
passions
are
the
necessary
consequences
of
his
temperament
that
his
will
and
his
actions
are
determined
by
these
same
passions
and
by
ideas
that
he
has
not
given
to
himself
in
a
word
everything
should
convince
man
that
during
every
moment
of
his
life
he
is
but
a
passive
instrument
in
the
hands
of
necessity
the
theory
of
animal
spirits
held
by
galen
and
elaborated
by
descartes
is
that
the
nerves
are
hollow
tubes
containing
a
volatile
liquid
the
animal
spirits
the
animal
spirits
were
supposed
to
circulate
from
the
periphery
to
the
brain
and
back
again
and
to
perform
by
their
action
all
the
functions
of
the
nerves
berkeley
uses
the
fact
that
the
color
of
objects
varies
as
one
argument
for
his
idealistic
conclusion
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
pythagoras
himself
taught
but
it
is
certain
that
he
taught
the
kinship
of
animals
and
men
and
upon
this
kinship
his
rule
for
the
abstinence
from
flesh
was
probably
based
among
the
writings
of
the
later
pythagoreans
we
find
strange
rules
for
diet
which
are
plainly
genuine
taboos
for
example
they
are
commanded
to
abstain
from
beans
not
to
break
bread
not
to
eat
from
a
whole
loaf
not
to
eat
the
heart
etc

use
of

in

ideal
republic
nature
first
care
when

enters
the

to
excite
in

a
kind
of
fever
thus
warmth
is
the
first
necessity
for
the
body
compare
with
this
descartes
statement
there
is
a
continual
warmth
in
our
heart
this
fire
is
the
bodily
principle
of
all
the
movements
of

members
this
is

in

see

the
nature
of
motion
is
as
unknown
to
us
as
that
of
matter
unlike
la
mettrie
toland
holds
that
it
is
possible
to
know
the
nature
of
matter
and
declares
that
motion
and
matter
can
not
be
defined
because
their
nature
is
holbach
resembling
la
mettrie
teaches
that
it
is
futile
to
seek
to
know
the
ultimate
nature
of
matter
or
the
cause
for
its
existence
thus
if
any
one
shall
ask
whence
matter
came
we
shall
say
that
it
has
always
existed
if
any
one
ask
whence
came
movement
in
matter
we
shall
answer
that
for
this
same
reason
matter
must
have
moved
from
eternity
since
motion
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
its
existence
its
essence
and
of
its
primitive
properties
such
as
extent
weight
impenetrability
shape
etc
the
existence
of
matter
is
a
fact
the
existence
of
motion
is
another
fact
huyghens
christian
was
born
at
the
hague
and
died
there
in
he
was
a
dutch
physicist
mathematician
and
astronomer
he
is
celebrated
for
the
invention
of
the
pendulum
clock
which
could
measure
the
movements
of
the
planets
for
the
improvement
of
the
telescope
and
for
the
development
of
the
of
light
his
principal
work
is
horologium

julien
leroy
was
a
celebrated
french
watchmaker
he
excelled
in
the
construction
of
pendulums
and
of
large
clocks
some
have
attributed
the
construction
of
the
first
horizontal
clock
to
him
but
this
is
doubtful
among
many
other
inventions
and
improvements
of
clocks
he
invented
the
compensating
pendulum
which
bears
his
name
jacques
de
vaucanson
was
a
french
mechanist
from
his
childhood
he
was
always
interested
in
mechanical
contrivances
in
he
presented
to
the
french
academy
his
remarkable
flute
player
soon
after
he
made
a
duck
which
could
swim
eat
and
digest
and
an
asp
which
could
hiss
and
dart
on
cleopatra
breast
he
later
held
the
position
of
inspector
of
the
manufacture
of
silk
in
he
was
admitted
to
the
academy
of
sciences
his
machines
were
left
to
the
queen
but
she
gave
them
to
the
academy
and
in
the
disturbances
which
followed
the
pieces
were
scattered
and
lost
vaucanson
published

paris
descartes
understood
animal
nature
he
was
the
first
to
prove
completely
that
animals
are
pure
machines
contrast
this
with
la
mettrie
former
reference
in
naturelle
de
to
this
absurd
system
animals
are
pure
machines
such
a
laughable
opinion
he
adds
has
never
gained
admittance
among
philosophers
experience
does
not
prove
the
faculty
of
feeling
any
less
in
animals
than
in
men
it
is
evident
that
la
opposition
to
this
system
was
based
upon
his
insistence
on
the
similarity
of
men
and
animals
in
machine
he
argues
from
the
same
premiss
that
animals
are
machines
that
men
are
like
animals
and
that
therefore
men
also
are
machines
notes
on
the
extracts
from

de
matter
according
to
la
mettrie
is
endowed
with
extensity
the
power
of
movement
and
the
faculty
of
sensation
as
la
mettrie
says
this
conception
was
not
held
by
descartes
who
thought
that
the
essential
attribute
of
matter
is
extension
the
nature
of
body
consists
not
in
weight
hardness
color
and
the
like
but
in
extension
alone
in
its
being
a
substance
extended
in
length
breadth
and
height
hobbes
conception
of
matter
is
very
similar
to
that
of
la
mettrie
he
specifically
attributes
motion
to
matter
motion
and
magnitude
are
the
most
common
accidents
of
all
bodies
he
does
not
name
sensation
as
an
attribute
of
matter
but
he
reduces
sensation
to
motion
sense
is
some
internal
motion
in
the
sentient
since
motion
is
one
of
the
attributes
of
matter
and
since
matter
is
the
only
reality
in
the
universe
sensation
must
be
attributed
to
matter
la
mettrie
always
insists
that
matter
has
the
power
of
moving
itself
and
resents
any
attempt
to
show
that
the
motion
is
due
to
an
outside
agent
in
this
opinion
he
is
in
agreement
with
toland
toland
says
that
those
who
have
regarded
matter
as
inert
have
had
to
find
some
efficient
cause
for
motion
and
to
do
this
they
have
held
that
all
nature
is
animated
this
pretended
animation
however
is
utterly
useless
since
matter
is
itself
endowed
with
motion
this
absurd
system
that
animals
are
pure
machines
